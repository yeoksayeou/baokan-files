Xinhua News Agency, April 11th. The Northeast Daily published an editorial on March 7th entitled "How to Implement the Economic Accounting System." This editorial summarizes the steps and main experiences of state-owned and public enterprises in Northeast China in implementing economic accounting, which is worthy of attention in various regions. The full text of the editorial is as follows:

One of the most important methods for managing people's enterprises is to implement enterprise management, and the specific implementation of enterprise management begins with implementing the economic accounting system. Comrade Gao Gang raised this issue once again to the entire party in Northeast China when discussing enterprise management in his report at the First Party Congress of the Northeast Region of the CCP.

Experience over the past few years, especially in the last year, has proven that enterprises that begin to implement the economic accounting system will reduce costs, increase productivity, and gradually eliminate waste in production; conversely, enterprises that neglect the economic accounting system and continue to follow the "supply system" will have the opposite results. Therefore, whether we conscientiously implement the economic accounting system has a significant impact on the quality of enterprise management.

Based on more than a year of practice, what are our main experiences on how to implement the economic accounting system?

First, is to carefully and strictly register and inventory the enterprise's capital and warehouses. That is, all the enterprise's capital should be inventoried and registered without omission, given a certain valuation, and the enterprise's current assets and fixed assets should be clearly distinguished (fixed assets should be calculated at constant prices). This is the prerequisite for carrying out economic accounting. After the fixed assets are registered and valued, a comprehensive depreciation rate can be determined as one of the bases for implementing economic accounting, so that the state's economic management organs and the management personnel of each enterprise can "have a clear understanding" and understand and grasp how much property each factory and mine occupies from the state, how much property it has accumulated for the state or how much property it has lost, and facilitate the state's unified dispatch. Without this, it is impossible to carry out any basic economic accounting and budget system. However, experience has shown that this kind of asset inventory work is not easy and must be carried out carefully and repeatedly, and strictly checked, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the expected results.

Second, launch a mass anti-waste campaign. In the early days of our takeover of enterprises, there was widespread waste in various enterprises. On the one hand, it was manifested in the fact that the responsible personnel of some enterprises lived in pleasure and corruption, squandered extravagantly, and a few old management purchasing personnel whose thinking had not been transformed embezzled public property for personal gain, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, and falsely reported accounts; on the other hand, and more importantly, it was the waste in the production process, such as: lack of production management system, poor organization of labor, low production efficiency, no standards for the consumption of raw materials, water and electricity, low product quality, many defective products, high costs, and a large amount of raw materials and finished products backlog or abandonment. This waste phenomenon is quite common and serious, causing huge losses to the people and the wealth of the country, and it is also a fatal flaw in our industrial construction. Therefore, the anti-waste struggle has become the second important link in our economic accounting. Our solution to this problem is to mobilize all workers, technicians, and staff to launch an anti-waste struggle, promote the staff's high patriotism and sense of ownership, improve production and improve quality, protect and save national capital, resolutely oppose waste, laziness, and irresponsible phenomena, and resolutely fight against all thieves and saboteurs, in order to implement democratic management and mass supervision. This has become the central content of implementing democratic management and carrying out rationalization proposals in a period of time.

Third, launch a new production record creation movement to increase labor productivity. After the mass anti-waste struggle has been launched, to deepen this struggle and overcome waste in production actively and concretely, and to push the economic accounting system forward, the most important link is to launch a mass new production record creation movement. We require more products, better quality, faster capital turnover, and lower costs; we require breakthroughs in the status quo and the creation of new records of various types in various departments of economic construction in order to increase labor productivity and promote the implementation of the economic accounting system. Because the phenomenon of exploitation and oppression of the working class in public enterprises no longer exists, they have become the masters of the enterprise. After class education and the concrete practice of democratic management, they have realized that they are working for themselves, so their labor attitude has fundamentally changed. They have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity, carefully mastered technology, improved tools, and improved operating methods, so they have greatly improved labor productivity and broken through the so-called "Manchukuo standard" or "theoretical standard." This not only educated the management personnel of our enterprises, but also concretely educated the working class themselves, proving the superiority of the people's economy, and also laid the necessary foundation for formulating new and reasonable quotas.

Fourth, formulate reasonable new quotas. Implementing quota management is another central link in implementing the economic accounting system. Comrade Stalin once pointed out that without technical quotas, it is impossible to implement planned guidance of the national economy. However, the outdated "technical point of view" and the outdated technical quotas are hindering the improvement of our labor productivity. Therefore, we must liberate ourselves from the so-called "Manchukuo standard" and break through the backward "status quo" in order to promote new and higher technical quotas and production standards. The mass movement to create new records has created this prerequisite for formulating reasonable new quotas.

Therefore, when the creation of new records has been widely launched and the enthusiasm of the masses has been fully mobilized, it is necessary to propose reasonable technical quotas in a timely manner, such as product quality standards, work hour standards, and standards for the use of raw materials, fuels, and water and electricity. The evaluation of all these new technical quotas must absorb the experience of advanced producers. Under normal circumstances, the new quota should be between the new record achieved by advanced producers and the technical standards that now exist naturally, and is a standard that can be achieved by general employees under normal and active working conditions.

With these new and reasonable quotas, we can implement production cost management.

Fifth, implementing cost management is another important link in implementing the economic accounting system. The so-called implementation of cost management is to conduct accurate calculation and management of product quality, quantity, number of machines, technical standards, production personnel, work hours, raw material prices and their consumption, depreciation rates, and various expenses, and all of this is inseparable from the formulation of reasonable quota standards. With reasonable quotas and cost accounting based on these quotas, it is possible to further solve the problem of reducing costs and accelerating capital turnover, and further promote the economic accounting system. In order to accelerate capital turnover, it is necessary to strictly implement the independent accounting system, so that the National Bank becomes the center of settlement and credit, and the bank supervises the capital turnover of each enterprise, thereby eliminating the phenomenon of each enterprise freely disposing of and wasting funds. At the same time, separating the production plan from the construction plan and carrying them out separately is also conducive to the realization of planned cost management.

Sixth, change to a new wage system and implement piece-rate wages. The formulation of quotas and the implementation of cost plans must be combined with the change to piece-rate wages. Labor quotas are stipulated according to the level of production technology and production organization, and giving due remuneration according to the quantity and quality of labor (that is, remuneration according to labor) will create workers' interest in the material benefits of labor, prompting them to improve their proficiency, make more rational use of equipment and tools, save and use waste, and encourage them to improve production and increase labor productivity. In this way, the more products each producer manufactures and the better the quality, the higher the wages they receive. Under our current socio-economic system, we must make full use of this individual material interest in labor, which is the most economical way to promote the continuous rise of labor productivity. The best form of wage for implementing remuneration according to labor is a reasonable piece-rate wage system. Obviously, under the circumstances of our industrial development, the current daily wage system and the small distance between wage grades are hindering the exertion of workers' labor enthusiasm and also affecting the further implementation of the economic accounting system. We should change to a piece-rate wage system in a step-by-step manner on the basis of creating new records and new quotas. For those enterprises that are still difficult to implement piece-rate wages for a while, transitional methods can be adopted, first implementing overtime bonuses, and then implementing piece-rate wages.

Seventh, establish a production responsibility system and strictly implement inspections. Quota management and the formulation of cost plans clarify the responsibilities of each production unit, each machine, each production process, and each person. The task of enterprise leaders is to concretize these responsibilities, scientifically organize the various production personnel and the connected production processes, conclude various contracts, and conduct timely inspections to eliminate various backward phenomena such as responsibility accidents, work stoppages waiting for materials, disconnection between production and sales, and shoddy manufacturing caused by unclear responsibilities and no one in charge, and cooperate with the production rationalization movement to achieve production rationalization; and production rationalization is the basic requirement of the economic accounting system.

In summary, our advanced factories and mines have generally experienced important steps such as registering capital and taking inventory of warehouses, carrying out anti-waste struggles, launching new record movements, formulating reasonable quotas, implementing cost management, adopting piece-rate wages, and establishing production responsibility systems on how to implement the economic accounting system. In addition to those factories and mines that have not yet seriously carried out the economic accounting system, especially enterprises engaged in local management and military production, should accept the experience of advanced factories and mines and implement the economic accounting system step by step, most of the current factories and mines should, in accordance with the instructions given by Comrade Gao Gang in the report of the First Party Congress of the Northeast Region: according to the level of technical equipment of each enterprise, the overcoming of waste, the improvement of the production enthusiasm of the masses, and the achievements we have achieved in the new record movement, stipulate a possible and reasonable production quota, in order to initially implement the management of production costs, that is, to implement the preliminary economic accounting system, and then further improve management, improve technology, and strive to gradually increase production quotas and reduce production costs on the basis of mass production competition.

To fight for economic accounting is to fight for savings, to fight for improving and expanding our productivity.

　　如何贯彻经济核算制
    ——东北日报三月七日社论
    【新华社十一日讯】东北日报于本月七日发表题为《如何贯彻经济核算制》的社论。这一社论，概括地阐述了东北国营公营企业实行经济核算的步骤和主要经验，值得各地重视。社论全文如下：
    管理人民企业最主要的方法之一，是实行经营企业化，而经营企业化的具体实施，首先则是贯彻经济核算制。这个问题高岗同志在中共东北区第一次党代表会议的报告中当论到企业管理问题时，又一次地向东北全党提出来了。
    几年来特别是最近一年来的经验证明：那个企业开始实行了经济核算制，那个企业的成本就会降低，生产力就会提高，而生产中的浪费就会逐渐消除；反之，那个企业如果忽视了经济核算制，而依然因袭于“供给制”，那么，它就得到了相反的结果。因之，我们是否认真贯彻经济核算制，对于企业管理的好坏有着巨大的关系。
    根据一年多的实践，关于如何贯彻经济核算制，我们有那些主要经验呢？
    首先，就是认真而严格地登记与清理企业的资材与仓库。即将企业所有资材，无一遗漏地加以清理和登记，并给予一定的估价，划清各该企业的流动资产与固定资产（固定资产要以不变价格计算），这是进行经济核算的前提。固定资产登记与估价之后，就可定出综合性的折旧率，作为实行经济核算的根据之一，以便国家的经济管理机关与各该企业的管理人员，都能“心中有数”，从而了解与掌握各该厂矿占用国家多少财产，给国家积累了多少财产或赔损了多少财产，并便于国家的统一调度。没有这一点，要进行任何起码的经济核算与预决算制度都是不可能的。但经验证明此种清理资产工作并非轻而易举，必须认真反复进行，并予以严格的检查，否则便难收到预期的效果。
    第二，开展群众性的反浪费闘争。在我们接管企业的初期，各个企业存在着普遍的浪费现象，一方面表现在某些企业的负责人员生活上享乐腐化、铺张挥霍，及少数思想未加改造的旧的管理采买人员假公济私、盗卖公物、勾结奸商、虚报账目；另一方面更重要的则是生产过程中的浪费，如：生产管理缺乏制度，劳动力组织得不好，生产效率低，原材料及水电消耗无标准，产品质量低、废品多、成本高，以及大量原料与成品的积压或遗弃等等。这种浪费现象是相当普遍而严重的，造成了对人民和国家财富的巨大损失，同时也是我们工业建设中致命的毛病。所以反浪费斗争成为我们进行经济核算的第二个重要的环节。我们解决这个问题的办法是发动全体工人、技术人员、职员展开反浪费斗争，发扬职工高度的爱国主义与主人翁的自觉，提高生产改善质量，保护与节约国家资材，坚决反对浪费、怠惰及不负责现象，严肃地与一切盗窃破坏分子作斗争，以贯彻民主化的管理与群众的监督。这曾经成为一个时期内实行管理民主化与开展合理化建议的中心内容。
    第三，开展创造生产新纪录运动，提高劳动生产率。在群众性的反浪费斗争已经展开之后，要深入这个斗争，做到积极地具体地克服生产中的浪费，把经济核算制向前推进一步，最重要的一环，就是开展群众性的创造生产新纪录运动。我们要求产品多，质量好，资金周转快，成本低；我们要求突破现状，创造经济建设中各个部门的、各式各样的新纪录，以便提高劳动生产率，从而推动经济核算制的贯彻。因为公营企业里的工人阶级被剥削被压迫的现象是不存在了，它们已经成为企业的主人，在经过了阶级教育，经过了管理民主化的具体实践之后，他们已经觉悟到他们是在为自己而工作，因此劳动态度根本改变了，它们发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，精心地掌握技术，改良工具，改善操作方法，所以大大地提高了劳动生产率，突破了所谓“伪满标准”或“理论标准”。这不仅教育了我们企业的管理人员，而且也具体地教育了工人阶级自己，证明了人民经济的优越性，同时也为制定新的合理的定额打下了必要的基础。
    第四，制定合理的新定额。实行定额管理，是贯彻经济核算制的又一个中心环节。斯大林同志曾经指出过：没有技术定额，就不能实行有计划地指导国民经济。但陈旧的“技术观点”与陈旧的技术定额，却阻碍着我们劳动生产率的提高。所以必须从所谓“伪满标准”解放出来，必须突破落后的“现状”，才能推进新的更高的技术定额与生产标准。而广大群众的创造新纪录运动，则为制定合理的新定额创造了这种前提条件。
    因此，当创造新纪录已经广泛展开，群众的积极性已经充分发动之后，必须适时地提出规定合理的技术定额，如产品的质量标准，工时的标定，原材料、燃料及水电使用的标准等等。所有这些新的技术定额的评定，都要吸收先进生产者的经验。在一般的情况下，新的定额应该是介乎先进生产者所达到的新纪录和现在自然存在的技术标准之间，而为一般职工正常积极工作条件下都能达到的标准。
    有了这种新的合理的定额，我们才能实行生产成本的管理。
    第五，实行成本管理，是贯彻经济核算制的又一个重要环节。所谓实行成本管理，就是对于产品的质量、数量，机器台数，技术标准，生产人员，工时，原材料价格及其消耗，折旧率，以及各种经费，进行精确的计算与管理，而所有这一切，都是同制定合理的定额标准分不开的。有了合理的定额以及在这种定额基础上的成本计算，才能够进一步解决减低成本与加速资金周转，更加促进经济核算制。为了加速资金周转，需要严格执行独立会计制度，使国家银行成为结算与信贷的中心，由银行监督各个企业资金的周转，从而消除那种各企业自由支配与浪费资金的现象。同时把生产计划与修建计划分开来做与分别进行，这也是有便于计划成本管理的实现的。
    第六，改行新的工资制度，实行计件工资制。定额的规定与成本计划的施行，必须与改行计件工资制结合起来。劳动定额，是按照生产技术和生产组织的水平来规定的，而按照劳动的数量与质量给予应得的报酬（即按劳取酬），就会造成劳动者对劳动物质利益上的兴趣，推动他们提高自己的熟练程度，更合理地利用装备和工具，节约与利用废物，鼓励他们改进生产和提高劳动生产率。这样每个生产者，他制造的产品愈多，质量愈好，他们得的工资就愈高。在我们目前的社会经济制度下，必须充分利用对劳动的这种个人物质利益上的兴趣，它是推动劳动生产率不断高涨的最经济的方法。而实行按劳取酬最好的工资形式就是合理的计件工资制。很明显的，在我们的工业日益发展的情况之下，我们目前所实行的计日工资制与工资等级之距离太小，是妨碍工人劳动积极性的发挥的，同时也影响到经济核算制的进一步贯彻。我们应该在创造新纪录运动与新的定额基础上有步骤地改行计件工资制。在那些一时还难以实行计件工资制的企业，可采用过渡的办法，先实行超额奖励，进而实行计件工资制。
    第七，建立生产责任制与严格实行检查。定额管理与成本计划的制定，就明确了每个生产单位，每台机器，每一个生产过程，每一个人的应尽责任。企业领导的任务，就是把这些责任加以具体化，并将各个生产人员与相连的各个生产过程加以科学地组织，订立各种合同，并及时进行检查，消灭各种由于职责不清与无人负责所形成的责任事故、停工待料、产销脱节、粗制滥造等落后现象，配合生产合理化运动达到生产的合理化；而生产合理化，则是经济核算制的基本要求。
    总之，关于如何贯彻经济核算制，我们一些先进的厂矿大体上已经经历了登记资材、清理仓库，进行反浪费斗争，开展新纪录运动，制定合理定额，实行成本管理，采用计件工资制，建立生产责任制等重要步骤。除了那些还没认真进行经济核算制的厂矿，特别是地方经营与进行军事生产的企业，应该接受先进厂矿的经验有步骤地贯彻经济核算制外，目前大多数的厂矿，应该按照高岗同志在东北第一次党代表会议的报告所指示我们的：根据各个企业的技术设备的水平、浪费的克服、群众的生产积极性的提高，以及我们在新纪录运动中所达到的成绩，而规定一种可能的合理的生产定额，以便由此初步地实行生产成本的管理，即实行初步的经济核算制，然后再进一步改进管理，提高技术，在群众生产竞赛的基础上力求逐步地提高生产定额与减低生产成本。
    为经济核算而斗争，就是为节约而斗争，为提高与扩大我们的生产力而斗争。
