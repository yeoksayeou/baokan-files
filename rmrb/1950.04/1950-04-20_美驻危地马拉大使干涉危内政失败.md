Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th (TASS): According to newspaper reports, the Guatemalan government has requested the US State Department to recall the US Ambassador to Guatemala, Patterson. This is due to Patterson's blatant interference in Guatemala's internal affairs during the upcoming presidential elections. According to newspaper reports, American capitalists' companies in Guatemala and Patterson himself attempted to use the upcoming presidential elections to overthrow the current Guatemalan government, because the current government does not meet the wishes of American monopoly capital. In order to achieve this goal, American companies specifically established a so-called "People's Party" in Guatemala, led by their agents, and these agents nominated the American lackey Granados as a presidential candidate. In order to exert pressure on the election campaign, US Ambassador Patterson, under the pretext of "protecting his personal safety," demanded that US troops be sent to Guatemala. The conspiracy carried out by American monopoly capitalists and the official representatives of the United States in Guatemala has aroused national indignation in Guatemala. United Press International mentioned "expressions of widespread anti-American sentiment in Guatemala." The Guatemalan government described Patterson's actions as blatant interference in the country's internal affairs and demanded Patterson's recall. The US State Department was therefore forced to recall Patterson to the United States.

　　美驻危地马拉大使干涉危内政失败
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：据报纸消息称：危地马拉政府已要求美国国务院召回美驻危地马拉大使巴特逊。这是因为巴特逊在危地马拉行将举行的总统选举中强横地干涉该国内政所引起的。据报纸消息称：美国资本家在危地马拉的公司与巴特逊本人，试图利用行将举行的总统选举，来推翻危地马拉现政府，因为现政府不合美国垄断资本的心意。为了达到这个目的，美国公司特在危地马拉建立由它们的代理人领导的所谓“人民党”，并由这些代理人推举美国的走狗格兰纳多斯为总统候选人。美大使巴特逊为了对竞选运动施加压力，就以“保护他的个人安全”为借口，要求把美军开进危地马拉。美国垄断资本家和美国驻危地马拉的官方代表所进行的阴谋，激起了危地马拉举国的愤慨。合众社曾提及“危地马拉广泛的反美情绪的表现”。危地马拉政府形容巴特逊的行为为公开干涉国家内政，并要求撤回巴特逊。美国国务院因此被迫把巴特逊召回美国。
