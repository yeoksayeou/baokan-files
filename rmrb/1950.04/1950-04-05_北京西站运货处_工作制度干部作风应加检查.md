　　Beijing West Railway Station Freight Depot
    Work System and Cadre Style Should Be Inspected
To the Editor:
    In order to organize production for military families in our district, we purchased four sorghum milling machines in Shenyang. They were shipped from Shenyang Station on March 12th, and we received the shipping notice on the 14th. On the same day, we inquired with the Beijing West Railway Station Freight Depot by telephone (telephone number 3-2680). The depot replied that the goods had not yet arrived. We continued to inquire by calling the same number every day. On the 18th, we sent someone with the shipping notice to the depot for inquiry. The depot gave the same reply that the goods had not arrived, and our goods number was not posted on the blackboard. We asked them to calculate the freight cost for shipping the machines from Shanhaiguan to Beijing so that we could prepare the funds. The depot told us to go to the inquiry office for calculation. After the inquiry office calculated the freight, we asked them to check if the goods had definitely not arrived. The reply was still that they had not arrived. On the 19th, we inquired again by telephone, and the answer was still that they had not arrived. On the 20th, we contacted them by telephone again, and they replied that the goods had arrived. We sent someone to pick them up at around 2:00 PM, but when they arrived at the depot to pick up the goods, the comrade in charge of delivery (name unknown) said, "The machines arrived on the 16th," and demanded three days of storage fees, totaling 35,500 yuan. We immediately questioned, "Since you replied on the 18th that the goods had not arrived, why do you now say they arrived on the 16th?" The comrade not only did not investigate the error but instead said, "We would never do such a thing." We immediately went to the inquiry office to question them. The office said, "We cannot guarantee that there are no errors, but we cannot balance the books if we don't collect this fee." In order to avoid affecting production for military families, we had to pay the freight depot 35,500 yuan for three days of storage fees. This is what happened, and we believe it is unreasonable. We hope that the responsible comrades at the depot will conduct an inspection!

    Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from the Civil Affairs Section of the First District People's Government, we called the West Railway Station Freight Depot twice to ask them to investigate the matter. However, a comrade at the depot who answered the phone did not investigate the matter and immediately stated, "This is impossible." Afterwards, we conducted several investigations with the First District People's Government. The results showed that the evidence was conclusive and that this was indeed the case. We believe that the style of some staff members at the Beijing West Railway Station Freight Depot is worthy of reflection. We hope that the station will investigate this matter and inform the newspaper of the results.

　　北京西站运货处
    工作制度干部作风应加检查编辑同志：
    本区为组织军属生产，在沈阳购妥高粱米机四台，三月十二日由沈阳站起运，十四日收到寄来的提货单。当日我们即用电话询问北京西站货运处（电话号码是三、二六八○），该处答复尚未到达；此后每日拨同一电话号码询问；并在十八日派员携提单到该处查询，该处同样答复未到，黑板上亦未登载我们的货物号码。我们请他们算算所运机器由山海关至北京的运费需要多少，好作准备，该处要我们到问事处计算。至问事处算出运费后，又请给查查货物是否确实未到，答复还是没到。十九日又用电话询问，回答仍是还未到达。二十日又用电话连络，他们答复已到。我们在下午两时许派员提取，但到该处取货时，管理提货工作的同志（姓名不详）说：“机器是十六日到的”，向我们要三天保管费，计三万五千五百元。我们即质问“十八号既然答复货未到，为什么现在却说是十六号到的？”该同志不但不检查错误，反而说：“我们根本不会这样作。”我们马上又到问事处质问，该处说：“我们保不定没有错误，但是不收这笔钱，就不能报账。”我们为了避免影响军属生产，只得向货运处缴纳三万五千五百元的三天保管费。事情的经过是如此，我们认为是不合理的，希望该处负责同志进行检查！
                              北京市第一区公所民政科                                                        
    编者按：我们收到第一区公所民政科来信后，二次打电话到西站货运处，请他们调查这件事。而该处接电话的一位同志，对这事不加调查，即认为：“这是不可能有的事。”此后我们又数次向第一区公所调查，结果证据确凿，证明这是事实。我们认为，北京西站货运处某些工作人员的作风是很值得检讨的。希望该站对此事加以检查；并且把结果告诉报纸。
