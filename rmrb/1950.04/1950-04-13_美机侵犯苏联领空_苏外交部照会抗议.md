　　U.S. Aircraft Intrudes into Soviet Airspace
    Soviet Foreign Ministry Lodges Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th] TASS, Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky met with U.S. Ambassador Kirk on the 11th and presented Kirk with the following note: "The Soviet Government considers it necessary to state the following to the U.S. Government: Based on conclusive evidence, at 17:39 on April 8th of this year, a U.S. military aircraft (Flying Fortress) of the B-29 type with four engines bearing American markings was detected at the southern tip of Libau (located in Latvia, on the Baltic Sea). The aircraft intruded 21 kilometers into Soviet airspace. In view of the continued intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet airspace, a squadron of Soviet fighter planes stationed at a nearby airfield took off to demand that the American aircraft follow them and land at the airfield. However, not only did the American aircraft fail to comply with this demand, but it even fired upon the Soviet aircraft. Therefore, the leading Soviet fighter plane was forced to return fire, after which the American aircraft turned towards the ocean and fled.
    The Soviet Government lodges a strong protest with the U.S. Government against this brazen act of the U.S. military aircraft in violating the Soviet border, which is also an unheard-of violation of the basic norms of international law."

　　美机侵犯苏联领空
    苏外交部照会抗议
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长维辛斯基于十一日接见美大使寇克，并以下列照会递交寇克：“苏联政府认为必须向美国政府声明如下：根据确凿材料，本年四月八日十七时三十九分，在利巴雅（按在拉脱维亚，滨波罗的海）南端发现有美国标志的Ｂ——二九式四引擎军用机（空中堡垒）一架。该机侵入苏联领土上空二十一公里。鉴于美国飞机继续侵入苏联领空，驻在附近机场之苏联战斗机一队即起飞，要求该美国飞机随行并在机场降落。但该美国飞机不仅不依从这一要求，并竟向苏联飞机射击。因此，苏联先头战斗机便不得不开火还击，俟后，美国飞机即转向海洋方面逸去。
    苏联政府向美国政府坚决抗议美国军用机这种蛮横侵犯苏联边境，同时又闻所未闻地违犯了国际公法基本法规的行径。”
