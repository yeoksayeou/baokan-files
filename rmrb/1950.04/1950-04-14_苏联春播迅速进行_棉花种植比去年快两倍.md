　　Soviet Spring Sowing Proceeds Rapidly
　　Cotton Planting Twice as Fast as Last Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th] A compilation of TASS Moscow dispatches: The spring sowing work in the Soviet Union is rapidly progressing northward with the footsteps of spring. In the southern Kuban, Moldova, Crimea, and sixteen states of Ukraine, the planned sowing of barley and wheat has been completed. The grain sowing work throughout Ukraine will be completed within days, and sugar beets are now being planted. By the 5th of this month, the collective farms in the southern regions had planted 4.6 million hectares more land than in the same period last year. In collective farms in Belarus and the states of Kaliningrad, Leningrad, etc., where spring comes later, land cultivation and fertilization are underway, and spring crops have also been sown in some places.
    Soviet newspapers are paying great attention to the progress of spring sowing. Local dispatches show that spring sowing is proceeding more rapidly than last year. Thanks to the large-scale use of machinery, by April 5, the area planted with perennial grasses had exceeded one and a half times that of the same period last year. Cotton planting is proceeding twice as fast as last year. A People's Daily editorial pointed out that the good organization and good technical preparation of collective farms and machine and tractor stations, the achievements of Soviet agriculture last year, the great help of the Soviet state, and the improvement of the Party's guidance work for collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms have created the necessary conditions for the victorious completion of spring sowing.

　　苏联春播迅速进行
　　棉花种植比去年快两倍
    【新华社十三日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联春播工作正随着春日的脚步迅速向北部进展。在南部的库斑、摩尔达维亚、克里米亚以及乌克兰的十六个州，业已完成播种大麦与小麦的计划，全乌克兰境内的谷物播种工作，日内即将完成，现正在种植甜菜。到本月五日止，南部各地区的集体农场，已比去年同期多种了四百六十万公顷的田地。在春日较迟的白俄罗斯及加里宁格勒、列宁格勒等州的集体农场，正在进行耕地和施肥的工作，若干地方也已播种了春季作物。
    苏联报纸对春播的进展给予极大注意。各地通讯报道显示春播比去年进行得更迅速。由于大量的使用机器，到四月五日为止，种植宿根草的面积已超过去年同期的一倍半。棉花种植的进行较去年快两倍。真理报社论指出：集体农场及机器与拖拉机站的良好组织与良好的技术准备，苏联农业去年所获得的成就，苏维埃国家的巨大帮助，党对集体农场、机器与拖拉机站和国营农场的指导工作的改进，为胜利地进行春播创造了必要条件。
