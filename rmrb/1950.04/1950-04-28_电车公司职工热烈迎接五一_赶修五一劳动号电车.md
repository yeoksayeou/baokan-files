　　Trolley Company Workers Enthusiastically Greet May Day
     Rush to Repair the "May Day Labor" Trolley
    [Our Dispatch] To commemorate International Labor Day, the workers of the Beijing Trolley Company's Repair Factory are actively rushing to repair locomotive No. "501". This car has been designated the "May Day Labor" car. This locomotive is of Japanese design, and its internal components differ from those of ordinary cars. Last year, the car was destroyed by fire, and repairs were delayed due to the difficulty in obtaining replacement parts. To commemorate "May Day", the workers of the factory unanimously expressed their determination to overcome all kinds of difficulties and complete the renovation work. At present, the carpentry team has completed all the woodwork. The metalworking team has fitted steel tiles and expansion rings to the burned-out air pump and cylinders. The undercarriage and electrical teams are also working intensely. At a recent joint meeting of group leaders and foremen, the color scheme for the car was designed: sky blue for the upper body, silver-gray for the lower body, with a red eagle and gold lettering. The trade union will send representatives to invite Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to inscribe the name of the car.

　　电车公司职工热烈迎接五一
     赶修五一劳动号电车
    【本报讯】京市电车公司修造厂职工为纪念“五一”劳动节，正积极赶修“五○一”号机车。该车已定名为“五一劳动号”。该号机车为日本式，内部机件与常车不同。去年该车被烧毁后，因材料难配而搁置未修。该厂为纪念“五一”节，工友一致表示坚决克服种种困难，完成翻新工作。目前木工班已做好一切木活。案工班将被烧坏的风泵、汽缸配上了钢瓦和涨圈。架车班、电工班也正紧张进行工作。日前在小组长、领班联席会上，设计了该车的颜色：上身为天蓝色，下身为银灰色，上画红鹰，描金字。工会将派代表请中共北京市委书记彭真同志题写车名。
