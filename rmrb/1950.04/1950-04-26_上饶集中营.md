　　Shangrao Concentration Camp
　　Shào Yǔ
　　In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of more than 200,000 men launched a perfidious attack on the more than 10,000 men of the New Fourth Army's Southern Anhui troops, who were struggling to fight behind enemy lines north and south of the Yangtze River, creating the shocking Anhui Incident, known both at home and abroad. Many captured New Fourth Army soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu was one of the patriotic figures imprisoned at that time. With skilled brushstrokes, and with intense hatred and love, he depicted the facts he witnessed that day, creating the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The heinous crimes of the Kuomintang secret service bandit gang, and the heroic deeds of the revolutionary fighters who would rather die than submit, are powerfully expressed. The collection has a total of twenty-three works, which are being serialized in this edition. Twenty-one works have already been published, and today the final works are published.

　　The People Cherish Us - We are For the People
　　At the end of June, the escaped comrades arrived at Qingzhuxi, a small village in the depths of the Wuyi Mountains. The Southern Red Army had been here before. After the Southern Red Army was centrally reorganized into the New Fourth Army and plunged into the front lines behind enemy lines to resist Japan, some of the village's young people also joined the New Fourth Army. When the villagers saw the comrades, they said, "Our own people are back!"
　　The comrades have returned to their own home!
　　On Wuyi Mountain
　　When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, turned their backs on Wuyi, and continued to flee south, a people's anti-Japanese guerrilla force appeared again on Wuyi Mountain.
　　Brave soldiers, you are worthy of being the sons and daughters of the Chinese people, students of Mao Zedong, and proletarian fighters!
　　Brave soldiers, may you always stand as majestic as the peaks of Wuyi!

    人民爱护我们  我们为了人民
    六月底，脱险的同志们到达了五夷深山的一个小小的村庄青竹溪。从前南方红军会曾经到过这里。南方红军集中改编为新四军挺入前线敌后抗日之后，村里的青年，有的也跟着参加了新四军。村里的农民们看见了同志们，并说：“自家人回来了！”
    同志们回到自己的家了！
    五夷山上
    当蒋介石匪帮，背向五夷，继续南逃的时候，五夷山上又出现了一支人民的抗日游击队。
    英勇的战士们，你们不愧为中国人民的儿女，毛泽东的学生，无产阶级的战士！
    英勇的战士们，你们永远像五夷高峰一样雄伟地站立着！
