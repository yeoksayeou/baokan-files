[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Joint Loan Syndicate of Public and Private Banks and Money Shops held its formal establishment meeting yesterday (the 26th), and loan work will begin immediately. More than 30 heads of various banks and money shops attended the establishment meeting. Mu Zexian, Director of the Municipal Industry Bureau, Peng Cheng, Deputy Director of the Commerce Bureau, Fu Huating, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Han Songshang, Manager of the Y盐业 Bank, spoke at the meeting, unanimously agreeing that the joint loan syndicate is a better organizational form for pooling social idle funds to serve production enterprises. Yin Yukun, Deputy Manager of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, pointed out in detail that in the past, private banks and money shops operated deposit and loan businesses by taking in high-interest deposits and lending out at high interest rates, with very short terms, making it difficult to combine with production enterprises. This business philosophy was caused by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and long-term price increases. In the past two months, financial prices across the country have tended to stabilize, speculative industrialists and businessmen have collapsed, and banks and money shops with improper business practices have suffered bad debts and heavy losses, leading to closures. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the changing economic situation. Last month, the Municipal People's Bank convened several symposiums with private banks and money shops, explaining that the current economic transformation requires timely improvement of business practices. However, some banks and money shops initially had doubts about price stability and insufficient understanding of interest rate reductions, resulting in failure to timely transform their businesses and effectively combine them with production, leading to significant losses. In the future, they must strive to reverse erroneous business policies and establish the idea of serving production and construction, which is the only bright path for the development of private banks and money shops. The meeting discussed and approved the Joint Loan Syndicate Covenant and the candidates for the Loan Committee. The committee consists of eleven members. In addition to Qi Zhigang and Wang Yiqiu recommended by the Municipal People's Bank, and Shi Yaoxian recommended by the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the private banks and money shops jointly elected Han Songshang, Tang Qingyong, Pan Yuyan, Zhang Qiquan, Zhao Chongyu, Qin Zhipu, Xu Zicai, and Liang Zhengfu as members. The Loan Committee has set up an office within the Beijing Banking Association and will begin its work of granting loans immediately.

The members participating in the Joint Loan Syndicate include the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, as well as the following private banks and money shops: Jincheng Bank, Dalu Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Xinhua Bank, Y盐业 Bank, China Industrial Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Guohua Bank, United Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Housheng Money Shop, Fushunde Money Shop, Renchang Money Shop, Chunhe Money Shop, Xiangruixing Money Shop, Sanjuyuan Money Shop, Yijuyuan Money Shop, Qianxing Money Shop, Tongyuanxiang Money Shop, Jixing Money Shop, Pingyi Money Shop, Rongchanghou Money Shop, Fusheng Money Shop, Renfagong Money Shop, Quanjuhou Money Shop, Qiming Money Shop, Jinhongyu Money Shop, Baosheng Money Shop, Zhongyuan Money Shop, Jitong Money Shop, and Yongzengh Money Shop, totaling 34 institutions.

　　集中社会游资为生产事业服务
    公私营银钱业联合放款团成立
    【京市新闻处讯】京市公私营银钱业联合放款银团昨（二十六）日举行正式成立大会，放款工作即开始进行，出席成立大会的有各银行钱庄负责人三十余人，市工业局局长牟泽衔、商业局副局长彭城、工商联合会筹委会主任委员傅华亭、盐业银行经理韩诵裳等在会上讲话，一致认为联合放款银团是集中社会游资为生产事业服务较好的组织形式。中国人民银行北京分行副经理殷玉昆并详细指出过去私营行庄经营存放款业务都是高利收进高利放出，期限很短，很难与生产事业结合，这种经营思想是由于国民党反动统治和物价长期上涨所造成的，近两月来全国各地金融物价趋向平稳，投机倒把的工商业垮台了，业务不正当的行庄纷纷吃呆帐、亏累不堪因而倒闭，这是经济情况转变中的必然现象。上月市人民银行曾几次召集私营行庄座谈，说明目前经济转变情况要及时改进业务，但部分行庄最初对物价平稳看法仍有怀疑，对利率降低也认识不足，致还未把业务及时转变很好的结合生产，因而受到不少亏损，今后必须努力扭转错误的经营方针，树立为生产建设服务的思想，这是私营行庄发展业务唯一的光明大道。会上讨论并通过了联合放款银团公约和放款委员会委员人选，委员计十一人，除市人民银行推定祁志刚、王挹秋，工商联合会筹委会推定史耀先为委员外，私营银行钱庄共推选韩诵裳、唐庆永、潘禹言、张企权、赵重毓、秦芝圃、徐子才、梁征甫等八人为委员。放款委员会在北京市银行公会内设办事处，即日开始办公进行放款工作。
    参加联合放款银团的团员，除中国人民银行北京分行外，私营行庄中计有：金城银行、大陆银行、上海银行、中孚银行、新华银行、盐业银行、中国实业银行、中南银行、浙江兴业银行、国华银行、联合银行、聚兴诚银行、厚生钱庄、福顺德钱庄、仁昌钱庄、春和钱庄、祥瑞兴钱庄、三聚源钱庄、义聚钱庄、谦兴钱庄、同元祥钱庄、济兴钱庄、平易钱庄、荣长厚钱庄、福生钱庄、仁发公钱庄、全聚厚钱庄、启明钱庄、晋鸿裕钱庄、宝生钱庄、中源钱庄、济通钱庄、永增合钱庄共三十四家。
