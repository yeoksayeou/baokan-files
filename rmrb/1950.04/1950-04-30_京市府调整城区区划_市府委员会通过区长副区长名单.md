[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to strengthen the administrative management of urban areas, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, having submitted a request to the Central People's Government's State Council and received approval, will adjust the district boundaries of the urban area from the 29th of this month, merging the original twelve districts into nine districts (five inner-city districts and four outer-city districts), and placing the suburbs adjacent to the urban area under the jurisdiction of the respective contiguous districts. In redrawing the district boundaries, the principle of not disrupting the original administrative regions as much as possible was adopted; with the exception of the original Fifth District, which was divided into two parts, the rest of the districts either remained entirely unchanged or were entirely merged with other districts. At the same time, in order to facilitate public security and tax collection work, the principle of not using major streets as dividing lines was adopted, correcting the past shortcomings of the same street belonging to two districts, which was detrimental to administrative management. The overview of each district after the adjustment is as follows:

First District: Formed by the merger of the original First District and the Chaoyangmen suburbs, with a population of approximately 182,559. The district office is located at the original First District office in Jinyu Hutong;

Second District: Formed by the merger of the original Second District, the area south of Mashi Street, Yangshi Street, and Fuchengmen Street in the original Fourth District, and the Fuchengmen suburbs, with a population of 50,344. The district office is located at the original Second District office in Wangye Futang;

Third District: Formed by the merger of the original Third District and the area east of Di'anmen Street, Caochang, and Jiugulou Street in the original Fifth District, and the Dongzhimen and Andingmen suburbs (Jiugulou Street belongs to the Fourth District), with a population of approximately 219,847. The district office is located at the original Third District office in Shiyitiao Hutong;

Fourth District: Excluding the area south of Mashi Street, Yangshi Street, and Fuchengmen Street in the original Fourth District, it is formed by the merger of the original Fourth District and the area west of Di'anmen Street and Jiugulou Street in the original Fifth District, and the Deshengmen and Xizhimen suburbs, with a population of approximately 190,059. The district office is located at the original Fourth District office;

Fifth District: Formed by the merger of the original Sixth and Seventh Districts, with East and West Chang'an Streets under its jurisdiction, Xuannei Street belonging to the Second District, and Chongnei Street belonging to the First District, with a population of approximately 129,129. The district office is located at the original Sixth District office on Xihua Men Street.

Sixth District: Formed by the merger of the original Eighth and Ninth Districts, with a population of approximately 163,562.

Seventh District: Formed by the merger of the original Tenth District and the Guangqumen and Zuo'anmen suburbs, with a population of approximately 105,558. The district office is located at the original Tenth District office;
