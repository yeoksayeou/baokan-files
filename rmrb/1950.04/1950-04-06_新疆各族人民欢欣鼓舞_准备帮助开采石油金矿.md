Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 5th. People from all walks of life in Dihua warmly support the agreement signed between our country and the Soviet Union to jointly establish oil and non-ferrous metal joint-stock companies. They unanimously believe that this is a concrete manifestation of the Soviet Union's sincere assistance to our people in building a new industrial China.

After the Han, Uyghur, and Kazakh newspapers in Dihua published the news of the signing of the agreement between China and the Soviet Union to establish two joint-stock companies in Xinjiang in a prominent position, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Dihua were excited and encouraged. Kama Liding (Tatar nationality), Deputy Director of the Industry and Mining Department of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, excitedly pointed out: "This news is so gratifying to the people of Xinjiang. Although Xinjiang is rich in mineral resources, it requires a lot of machinery and money to exploit them. With our current technical conditions and financial strength, the difficulties are too great. This agreement solves all our difficulties. The Soviet Union has given us great help in terms of machinery, capital, and technology. It will turn the infinite mineral resources hidden in Xinjiang into real wealth and promote the development of Chinese industry." He sincerely stated: "The Industry and Mining Department is willing to represent the industrial and mining circles of the province, participate in this work with all our strength, and learn humbly from Soviet experts so that Xinjiang's industry can embark on the road of mechanization and modernization as soon as possible." Ibulayin, Acting Chairman of the Xinjiang Association for the Defense of Peace and Democracy, believes that the establishment of these two companies is the beginning of Xinjiang's industrial development. He said: "This is of great help to the development of industry in China, especially in Xinjiang. The establishment of these two companies helps us to exploit the deposits that have been impossible to exploit for many years. This undoubtedly is completely in line with the interests of the Chinese people. Every comrade of our New League sincerely supports this agreement and looks forward to its speedy implementation." Jiang Yanyuan, Deputy Director of the Dihua City Federation of Trade Unions, said: "This agreement is of great help to the workers of this province. It enables our workers to learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, improve our technology, and promote the modernization of our province's industry." Nusreti, Secretary-General of the Xinjiang Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, pointed out: "This agreement specifically demonstrates the Soviet Union's willingness to help us build a backward China into a progressive China. This is completely different from the agreements signed by the reactionary派 and Anglo-American imperialism in the past to exploit and oppress our people." When the news reached the People's Congress of all ethnic groups in Dihua County, the representatives were overjoyed and talked about it: "Our bright and happy days have arrived." "As long as we cooperate closely with the Soviet Union, our backward agricultural country will soon become an advanced industrial country." "The establishment of these two companies will benefit workers, peasants, and businessmen." Everyone was excited and used Uyghur, Kazakh, and Chinese to express the aspirations of the 30,000 people of Dihua County.

　　新疆各族人民欢欣鼓舞  准备帮助开采石油金矿
    【新华社迪化五日电】迪化各界人士热烈拥护我国与苏联签订合办石油和有色金属两个股份公司的协定，一致认为这是苏联真诚帮助我国人民建设工业新中国的具体表现。
    迪化市汉、维、哈文各报，以极显著地位刊载中苏两国签订协定在新疆创办两个联合股份公司的新闻后，迪化市各族各界人民，无不兴奋鼓舞。新疆省人民政府工矿厅副厅长卡麻利鼎（塔塔尔族）兴奋地指出：“这消息太使新疆人民高兴了。新疆矿产虽然蕴藏丰富，但要开采是需要很多机器和金钱的，以我们目前技术条件与财政力量来说，困难是太多了。这一个协定正是给我们解决了一切困难，无论在机器上，资本上与技术上，苏联都给了我们很大帮助。它将使新疆地底里蕴藏的无穷矿产变成真正的财富，促进中国工业的发展。”他诚挚地表示：“工矿厅愿代表本省工矿界，以全力参加这一工作，虚心向苏联专家学习，使新疆工业早日走上机械化与现代化的道路。”新疆保卫和平民主同盟代主席伊不拉引认为这两个公司的创立，是新疆工业发展的开始。他说：“这对发展全中国特别是新疆的工业建设有很大的帮助。这两个公司的成立，帮助我们开采多少年来无法开采的蕴藏，这无疑义是完全符合中国人民的利益的。我们新盟每一个同志都诚挚拥护这一协定，并盼望这一协定迅速执行。”迪化市总工会副主任姜演元说：“这一协定对本省工人的帮助实在太大了，它使我们工人能够好好学习苏联建设的经验，提高我们的技术，促进我们本省的工业走向现代化。”中苏友协新疆分会总干事努斯热提指出：“这一协定具体表现了苏联愿意帮助我们将落后的中国建设为进步的中国。这是与过去反动派和美英帝国主义签订的剥削我们人民、压迫我们人民的协定完全不同的。”当消息传到迪化县各族各界人民代表大会之时，代表们欢喜万状，纷纷议论：“我们光明幸福的日子到来了。”“只要和苏联亲密合作，我们落后的农业国会很快变成先进的工业国。”“这两个公司的创办，对工人、农民、商人都有利益。”他们个个兴高彩烈，以维、哈、汉三种语言，道出了迪化县三万人民的心声。
