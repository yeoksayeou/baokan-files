The Provincial People's Government Issues Mobilization Order
Hebei Intensifies Cotton Planting

[This Dispatch] According to the Hebei Daily: The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued a mobilization order on the 18th for the urgent launch of the sowing campaign. The original text is as follows:

"Three-tenths of the harvest is assured with seedlings." As Grain Rain arrives and a thorough rain falls, seize the opportunity to rush planting, especially cotton planting, which is the most urgent combat task at present. Governments at all levels must actively lead the masses, urgently mobilize, and make the greatest efforts to successfully complete this task. To this end, it is necessary to:

1. Governments at all levels must resolutely put aside all work that can be postponed, organize cadres that can be drawn out, go deep into the countryside, door-to-door, and specifically organize and help the masses launch the sowing campaign. All public enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must immediately invest the material resources that can be used for sowing into the countryside in a planned way to serve the completion of sowing.

2. Seizing the rain to rush planting is the urgent demand of the broad masses. Manpower, livestock, and farm implements will inevitably be in short supply. Therefore, it is necessary to organize manpower and animal power assistance in a guided and mutually beneficial way, combine plows and sets; in areas with severe shortages of animal power, organize people to pull plows and seeders. It is necessary to universally mobilize all male and female full and semi-labor forces to invest in sowing to complete the sowing task. All localities must firmly grasp the implementation of this important link. For the land of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents who lack labor, it is necessary to earnestly implement cultivation and assistance to ensure timely sowing.

3. Localities can launch a cotton planting assault week (or several days), according to local conditions, and promptly do a good job in distributing cotton seeds, seed selection, seed soaking, seed testing, inspecting cotton fields, and organizing sowing in a timely manner. Cadres at all levels who go to the countryside to inspect work must go deep among the masses, provide specific guidance, set an example, and effectively promote the work of sowing cotton.

4. Promote the new heroism of cadres and the masses, carry out the movement of establishing merit and selecting models, and promptly commend and encourage the masses or cadres who work actively, lead the masses, are creative, and have achievements; criticize and educate, or even punish, cadres who do not earnestly perform their tasks and are divorced from the masses. Establish a work style of clear merits and demerits, and strict rewards and punishments. It is hoped that cadres at all levels will actively create, work deeply, and connect with the masses in the spring sowing campaign, and strive to complete the spring sowing, especially the cotton sowing task.

　　省人民政府颁发动员令
    河北突击播种植棉
    【本报讯】据河北日报消息：河北省人民政府于十八日颁发紧急开展播种运动的动员令，原文如下：
    “见苗三分收”，谷雨节到，又值普落透雨，抓紧时机突击播种；特别是突击植棉，是当前最紧急的战斗任务。各级政府必须积极领导群众，紧急动员起来，为胜利完成此任务而尽最大努力。为此必须：
    一、各级政府坚决放下一切可以缓办的工作，组织可能抽出的干部，深入农村，挨门逐户，具体组织与帮助群众展开播种运动。各公营企业及供销社等要将可能用于播种的物资力量，立即有计划的投入农村，为完成播种而服务。
    二、趁雨抢种是广大群众的迫切要求，人力畜力和农具必将更感缺乏。因此必须有领导的而又是自愿两利的组织人畜力插伙互助，合犋搭套；畜力奇缺的地区，组织人拉犁耧。要普遍发动所有男女整半劳动力投入播种，以完成播种任务。各地必须紧紧抓着贯彻这一重要环节。对缺乏劳力的烈军工属的土地，要认真执行代耕、助耕，保证按时播种。
    三、各地可根据当地情况，开展植棉突击旬（周），及时做好发放棉种、拣种、浸种、验种、检查棉地、适时组织播种等工作。各级下乡检查工作的干部，必须深入群众，具体指导，以身作则，有效地推动播种棉花的工作。
    四、发扬干部与群众的新英雄主义，开展立功选模运动，对积极工作、带领群众、有创造、有成绩的群众或干部，要及时表扬鼓励；对不认真执行任务、脱离群众的干部，要及时予以批评教育，甚至处分。以树立功过分明、赏罚严明的作风。望各级干部要在春季播种运动中，积极创造，深入工作，联系群众，为完成春季播种、特别是棉花播种的任务而奋斗。
