Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th: According to TASS, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a note on April 20th to the U.S., British, and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, protesting the three governments' violation of the Italian Peace Treaty and the regulations of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, turning Trieste into an illegal U.S.-British military base.

The Soviet note pointed out that, according to the Italian Peace Treaty, which came into effect on September 15, 1947, Trieste should be established as a demilitarized and neutral free territory, and the Security Council should appoint a governor to organize a temporary government when the treaty came into effect. At the same time, all foreign troops stationed in the free territory should be withdrawn by the end of January 1948. However, all these provisions have not been fulfilled to this day due to the arrogant obstruction of the U.S., Britain, and France.

The note also stated that the Italian Peace Treaty stipulates that the democratic rights of the people of the free territory should be ensured, but due to the illegal extension of the rule by the U.S. and British military authorities, the people of Trieste are still under police rule, democratic people are persecuted, while war criminals are at large. The note also pointed out that the local economic life has stagnated, industrial production is only 30% of the pre-war level, and the people are suffering from the burden of huge occupation costs.

The note emphasized that Trieste has not only failed to become a free territory managed on a democratic basis, but has instead become an illegal U.S.-British military base in southern Europe, on territory that belongs neither to the United States nor to Britain. It has become a military springboard occupied by U.S. and British armed forces, posing a threat to European peace and security.

The Soviet government believes that this situation cannot be allowed to continue, and demands strict implementation of the Italian Peace Treaty, and proposes: (1) immediately implement the temporary government regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste; (2) immediately appoint a governor for the free territory; (3) establish a temporary government for the free territory; (4) determine the effective date of the permanent regulations for the free territory; (5) abolish the illegal U.S.-British naval base; (6) withdraw the U.S.-British occupation forces.

Note: Recently, under the connivance and instigation of U.S. and British imperialism, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Yugoslavia's Tito have successively and openly demanded the merger of the Free Territory of Trieste, attempting to overturn previous international agreements, bypass the Security Council, and privately divide the free territory, thereby legalizing the U.S. and British position in Trieste through the traitorous and reactionary governments of Italy and Yugoslavia.

　　苏联政府照会美英法
    抗议三国违反对意和约及外长会议规定
    将的港自由区变成美英非法基地的行为
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯于四月二十日以照会一件递交美英法三国驻苏大使，抗议三国政府违反对意和约以及外长会议的规定，将的里雅斯特变为美英非法军事基地的行为。
    苏联照会指出：按照一九四七年九月十五日生效的对意和约的规定，的里雅斯特应成立非军事化与中立的自由区，并由安理会在和约生效时任命总督组织临时政府，同时，所有驻在自由区的外国军队，应在一九四八年一月底以前撤完。但是，所有这些规定，均因美英法三国的蛮横阻挠，迄今仍未能履行。
    照会又称：对意和约规定应确保自由区人民的民主权利，而由于美英军事当局非法延长其统治，的里雅斯特人民迄今却处在警察统治之下，民主人民遭到迫害，而战争罪犯却逍遥法外。照会并指出该地经济生活已陷于停顿，工业生产仅及战前百分之三十，人民苦于负担庞大的占领费用。
    照会着重指出：的里雅斯特不仅未成为根据民主基础加以管理的自由区，反而成为南欧一块既不属于美国，又不属于英国领土上的非法美英军事基地，成为美英武装部队所占领的军事跳板，构成了对欧洲和平与安全的威胁。
    苏联政府认为这种情形不容再予继续，要求严格执行对意和约，并提议：（一）立刻实行的里雅斯特自由区临时政府条例；（二）立刻任命自由区总督；（三）成立自由区临时政府；（四）确定自由区永久法规生效日期；（五）取消美英非法海军基地；（六）撤退美英占领军。
    按：最近时期以来，在美英帝国主义的纵容与唆使下，意大利外长史佛卓与南斯拉夫的铁托，曾先后公然要求合并的里雅斯特自由区，企图推翻历次国际协议，越过安理会而私自瓜分自由区，并以此使美英在的里雅斯特的地位通过意南两国之卖国反动政府而合法化。
