　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The seventh meeting of the Central People's Government Committee was held yesterday at 7:30 PM. The meeting listened to and approved the report (full text to be issued separately) by Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council and Director of the Financial and Economic Commission, on the financial and food situation. After hearing the report by Chen Shaoyu, Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, on the draft Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the meeting unanimously adopted the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China.

　　Following Director Chen Yun's report, Ma Yinchu, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council, spoke, pointing out that the significant achievement of price stabilization was due to the People's Government's adoption of correct and forceful measures, contrary to the Kuomintang reactionary government, to consolidate revenue and expenditure, control the market, and centralize cash.

　　Chairman Mao Zedong spoke on Director Chen Yun's report, saying: The Financial and Economic Commission of the Government Administration Council has made great achievements in consolidating revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices in the past six months. The policy of the Financial and Economic Commission is correct. There are still some shortcomings in the work that should be corrected. Chairman Mao said: Our country's financial situation has begun to improve, which is a very good phenomenon. However, the fundamental improvement of the entire financial and economic situation requires three conditions: the completion of land reform, the reasonable adjustment of existing industry and commerce, and a substantial reduction in national military and administrative expenditures. These should be gradually achieved and are entirely achievable. At that time, a fundamental improvement can occur. In the next few months, the focus of the work of the government's financial and economic leading organs should be on adjusting the interrelationships between public and private enterprises and various departments of public and private enterprises, and striving to overcome the state of anarchy. Chairman Mao said: The provisions of the Common Program, "In terms of business scope, raw material supply, sales markets, labor conditions, technical equipment, financial policies, and monetary policies, various social economic components should be coordinated under the leadership of the state-owned economy, dividing labor and cooperating, each finding its proper place," must be fully implemented to benefit the restoration and development of the entire national economy. Certain confused ideas that have already occurred in this regard must be clarified.

　　Chen Shaoyu, Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, gave a detailed explanation of the various principles of the draft Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. He cited evidence to show that the feudal marriage system is harmful to society and must be abolished. The new democratic marriage system stipulated by the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, which guarantees freedom of marriage for men and women, monogamy, equality of rights for men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children, is beneficial to social development and should be implemented quickly.

　　Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premier, expressed their opinions on the Marriage Law. President Shen Junru pointed out that the Marriage Law is a progressive and complete marriage law that consolidates family happiness, promotes social development, and is entirely suitable for the needs of the new democratic stage. Vice Premier Huang Yanpei said that this carefully drafted Marriage Law is reasonable and considerate of various aspects. In the future, extensive publicity and education work should be carried out to ensure that the law is effectively implemented nationwide.

　　The following attended the meeting: Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairmen Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Central People's Government Committee members Li Lisan, Lin Boqu, Peng Dehuai, Wu Yuzhang, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Zhou Enlai, Luo Ronghuan, Ulanhu, Xu Teli, Liu Geping, Ma Yinchu, Chen Yun, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Deng Xiaoping, Shen Junru, Shen Yanbing, Chen Shutong, Li Xijiu, Huang Yanpei, Cai Tingkai, Peng Zemin, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Li Zhuchen, Zhang Bojun, Cheng Qian, Zhang Xiruo, Chen Mingshu, Tan Pingshan, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Yazi, Zhang Dongsun, and Long Yun, totaling forty-two people.

　　The following attended the meeting as non-voting delegates: members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Presidents and members of the Supreme People's Court, Deputy Procurators-General and members of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, heads and deputy heads of various commissions, ministries, associations, institutes, departments, and banks under the Central People's Government, and mayors and deputy mayors of Beijing and Tianjin, totaling more than one hundred and sixty people.

　　中央人民政府委员会第七次会议
    批准财政和粮食状况报告通过中华人民共和国婚姻法
    毛主席指示调整工商业争取财经情况根本好转
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府委员会第七次会议于昨日下午七时半举行。会议听取和批准了政务院副总理兼财政经济委员会主任陈云关于财政状况和粮食状况的报告（全文另发）。会议在听取了中央人民政府法制委员会主任委员陈绍禹关于中华人民共和国婚姻法草案的报告后，一致通过了中华人民共和国婚姻法。
    在陈云主任报告后，政务院财政经济委员会副主任马寅初讲话，指出物价稳定的重大成就，是由于人民政府与国民党反动政府相反，采取了整理收支、控制市场、集中现金的正确有力措施的原故。
    毛泽东主席就陈云主任的报告讲话说：政务院财政经济委员会过去六个月在整理收支、稳定物价方面的工作有了很大的成绩。财经委员会的方针是正确的。工作中还有一些缺点，应当注意改正。毛主席说：我们国家的财政情况已开始好转，这是很好的现象。但整个财政经济情况的根本好转需要有三个条件，即：土地改革的完成，现有工商业的合理调整和国家军政费用的大量节减，这些应当争取逐步实现，也是完全可以实现的，那时就可以出现根本的好转。今后几个月内政府财经领导机关的工作重点，应当放在调整公营企业与私营企业以及公私企业各个部门的相互关系方面，极力克服无政府状态。毛主席说：共同纲领的规定，“在经营范围、原料供给、销售市场、劳动条件、技术设备、财政政策、金融政策等方面，调剂各种社会经济成分在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所”，必须充分实现，方有利于整个人民经济的恢复和发展。现在已经发生的在这方面的某些混乱思想，必须澄清。
    中央人民政府法制委员会陈绍禹主任委员对中华人民共和国婚姻法草案的各项原则作了详细说明。他列举证据说明封建主义的婚姻制度对社会是有害的，必须予以废除，而中华人民共和国婚姻法所规定的男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等、保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度，对社会发展是有益的，应当迅速予以施行。
    最高人民法院沈钧儒院长和黄炎培副总理对婚姻法发表了意见。沈钧儒院长指出婚姻法是巩固家庭幸福、促进社会发展的，是完全适合新民主主义阶段的需要的一部进步的完备的婚姻法。黄炎培副总理说，这部经过慎重起草的婚姻法是合情合理，照顾了多方面的，今后要广泛进行宣传教育工作，以求该法在全国范围内切实实现。
    出席这次会议的，有：主席毛泽东、副主席朱德、刘少奇、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜，中央人民政府委员李立三、林伯渠、彭德怀、吴玉章、彭真、薄一波、聂荣臻、周恩来、罗荣桓、乌兰夫、徐特立、刘格平、马寅初、陈云、马叙伦、郭沫若、邓小平、沈钧儒、沈雁冰、陈叔通、李锡九、黄炎培、蔡廷锴、彭泽民、张治中、傅作义、李烛尘、章伯钧、程潜、张奚若、陈铭枢、谭平山、张难先、柳亚子、张东荪、龙云共四十二人。
    列席这次会议的，有：中国人民政协全国委员会委员，最高人民法院副院长、委员，最高人民检察署副检察长、委员，中央人民政府所属各委、部、会、院、署、行正副首长及京津两市正副市长共一百六十余人。（附图片）
