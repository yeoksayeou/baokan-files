　　Ehrenburg Publishes Open Letter
　　Urging Upright Western Writers to Advocate for Anti-Atomic Bomb Movement
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 10th] According to TASS Moscow: The famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg recently published an open letter in the Soviet Literary Gazette, urging Western writers, at this moment when all people, all nations, and all cultures are facing the greatest danger, to take the lead in advocating the signing of a grand appeal demanding the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the regulation of the enforcement of this prohibition, and suggesting that they condemn any government that dares to be the first to use atomic bombs to bomb the residents of any country.
　　Ehrenburg pointed out: The "secret" of atomic weapons production is no longer the sole monopoly of any one country. And anyone who claims to oppose our demand to ban atomic weapons will thereby expose his sinister intentions. Anyone who is unwilling to denounce those who dare to use this weapon as war criminals will thereby reveal his inhumane intentions. All people need peace, art needs peace, and the muse of literature should now rise up and loudly call for an end to the guns speaking.
　　Ehrenburg urged the writers known as the "conscience of mankind," those upright Western writers who cannot sympathize with plans for the mass slaughter of people but have never risen up against the atomic bomb, to shout in loud and powerful voices: Ban atomic weapons! Give peace to mankind!

　　爱伦堡发表公开信
    呼吁正直的西方作家倡导反对原子弹运动
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名作家爱伦堡顷在苏联文学报发表公开信，吁请西方作家在这全体人民、一切民族、全部文化都面临着最大危险的时刻，率先倡导在要求无条件禁用原子武器并管制这一禁令的执行的和大呼吁书上签名，并建议他们谴责胆敢最先使用原子弹来轰炸任何国家的居民的政府。
    爱伦堡指出：原子武器生产的“秘密”，早就不再是由那一个国家所单独垄断的了。而谁要是声言反对我们要求禁止原子武器，谁就将因此而暴露出他的罪恶图谋。谁要是不愿把那胆敢使用这一武器的人斥为战犯，谁就将因此而泄露出他的不人道的意图。全体人民都需要和平，艺术需要和平，现在的文艺之神应该起来大声疾呼，阻止枪炮说话。
    爱伦堡促请被称为“人类的良心”的作家们，那些不能同情大规模屠杀人民的计划、而却一直不曾起来反对原子弹的正直的西方作家们，应以响亮有力的声音喊出：禁止原子武器！给人类以和平！
