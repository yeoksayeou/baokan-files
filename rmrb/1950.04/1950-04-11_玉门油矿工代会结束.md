Northwest Federation of Trade Unions reports: The Yumen Oil Mine Company of Gansu convened a workers' representative conference on February 19th and simultaneously established a company management committee. During the meeting, the representatives sharply exposed the management system during the reactionary rule of bureaucratic capital and, with the attitude of masters, determined the policy of implementing "democratic management" and "enterprise operation." They also passed 34 regulations concerning production savings and the realization of enterprise operation.

In order to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day, the company has launched a production merit campaign. The electromechanical plant is striving to start producing machine oil by "May Day" and repair 19 scrapped vehicles as a "May Day" gift.

　　玉门油矿工代会结束
    【本报讯】西北总工会报道：甘肃玉门油矿公司于二月十九日召开工人代表会，并同时成立了公司管理委员会。会中代表们尖锐的揭发了过去官僚资本反动统治时期的经营管理制度，并以主人翁的态度确定了实行“管理民主化”和“经营企业化”的方针，通过了有关生产节约与实现企业化的条例三十四项。
    该公司为迎接“五一”国际劳动节，现已开展生产立功运动。机电厂争取在“五一”开始出产机油，并修复十九辆报废汽车，作为“五一”献礼。
