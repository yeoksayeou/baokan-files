　　I Misunderstood the Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation Agreement
　　Fang Qing
　　When I saw in the newspaper that China and the Soviet Union had signed an agreement to exploit oil and non-ferrous metals, my feelings were very complicated. My first thought was that as long as it was a deal with the Soviet Union, China would not suffer. But a doubt lingered in my mind: the minerals are ours, why should we split them evenly? Why don't we get a bigger share, like a 30/70 or 40/60 split? I kept thinking: it's our stuff, but we have to share it equally with others.

　　After several days of thinking, I realized that I was somewhat foolish. First of all, where are the minerals that I keep thinking about, and how can we get them? This reminded me of the story of a friend's father going bankrupt. He invested in the exploitation of a gas well, originally estimated to burn for five years, but after three months the gas was gone, far from enough to cover the investment. That is to say, mining requires a long time and a large investment to be profitable. From searching and prospecting to mining and smelting, it is not an easy task. For such an arduous undertaking, there are three paths for the Chinese people to take: one is to operate on our own, one is to operate as a joint venture, and one is to lease. I think operating on our own is the best option. But we have neither the people nor the money. So I thought about borrowing people and money from the Soviet Union. The People's Daily editorial on April 5th poured cold water on me. Have we only learned to think for ourselves and not for others! Yes, the Soviet Union is neither a country with overproduction nor a country with overpopulation. Their machines can be used for their own construction projects, and their cadres can do more beneficial things for their own people. So if we don't have money or people, then let's not mine. Let's leave it there, anyway, it's not going to run away. This miserly idea once stubbornly occupied my mind. We will never industrialize, but we will always have a deposit of minerals. If we use this kind of thinking to guide the Chinese people's construction, the Chinese people will forever sleep next to gold and live in poverty! The People's Daily editorial on April 5th quoted the great Lenin's instructions, pointing out the path that the Soviet Union had taken, and awakened me. For the sake of construction, for the sake of industrialization, appropriate concessions are also possible, even to capitalist countries. Now, looking back at the conditions of the Sino-Soviet joint venture, in terms of investment, we are responsible for the land, factories, houses, and building materials, while the Soviet Union provides various mechanical equipment, industrial equipment, and detectors. In terms of personnel, we have cadres who are yet to be trained, while the Soviet Union sends experts and technicians. This is the situation of the joint venture, but the finished products extracted are split equally. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's mineral resources have not been exhausted, and they are not so poor as to come to China to make a fortune. Today, they are willing to engage in these businesses with us under the above conditions, which is a manifestation of friendship. Thinking of this, my thinking became clear, and my doubts were dispelled.

　　I found that although I am a Communist Party member, the miserly ideas of feudal society and the exploitative ideas of capitalist society, which only think for themselves and want to take advantage, still remain in my mind. This is something that deserves serious vigilance.

　　我误解了中苏经济合作协定
    方卿
    当我从报纸上看到中苏两国签订开采石油和有色金属的协定时，心情是非常复杂的。我首先想，只要是和苏联办的交道，中国总不会吃亏。但是有个疑团闷在我的心中，矿产是我们的，为什么两家平分呀？为什么我们不多分一些，譬如说三七分或四六分。我反复的想：是我们的东西，可是要和人家平分。
    经过几天来的思索，我发现我是有些愚昧的。先说我所念念不忘的矿产，矿产在那里呀，怎样才可弄到手呢？这使我想起一个朋友的父亲破产的故事。他投资于一眼火井的开采，原来估计可以燃烧五年，但是三个月煤气完了，远不够抵偿投资的代价。就是说，关于开矿的事，是需要很长一个时间和很大一笔投资才能获利的。从寻找、探测到开采、冶炼并不是一个轻而易举的工作。对于这样一种艰巨事业，摆在中国人民面前有三条路可走，一个是自己经营，一个是合股经营，一个是租让。我觉得以自己经营为上策。可是我们没有人也没有钱。于是我想到跟苏联借人和借钱。四月五号人民日报社论给我浇了一瓢冷水。难道我们只学会为自己设想不为旁人设想吗！是的，苏联既不是一个生产过剩的国家，又不是一个人口过剩的国家。他们的机器可以用在自己的建设事业上，他们的干部可以为本国的人民多做些有利的事。那么没钱没人，就不开采好了。放着吧，反正放着是跑不了一块的。这种守财奴的思想曾经很顽固的占据在我脑子里。我们永远不工业化，可是我们却永远有着一笔矿产。靠着这种思想来指导中国人民建设事业，中国人民将要永远睡在金子旁边过穷日子！四月五号人民日报社论引用了伟大的列宁的指示，指出了苏联所曾走过的道路，把我惊醒了。为了建设，为了工业化，适当的租让也是可以的，甚至可租给资本主义国家。现在再翻过来看看中苏两国合股的条件，拿投资来说，我们担任的是地段、工厂、房屋、建筑材料，苏联拿出来的是各种机械装备，工业器材，探测器。拿人来说吧，我们是正待培养的干部，苏联来的是专家、技师。是这样一种的合股情况，可是开采出来的成品，却是平分。再说，苏联的矿产并未开完，并没有穷得要到中国来发洋财。今天，他们愿在上述条件下来和我们合股经营这些事业，是友谊的表现。想到这里，我的思想搞通了，疑团尽释。
    我发现我虽然是一个共产党员，可是在我思想上还残存着封建社会的守财奴的思想，并且残存着资本主义社会只会为自己打算好拣便宜的剥削思想。这是值得严重警惕的。
