How Lunar Eclipses Happen
    Xue Qin Fang
    Between 3:00 AM and 6:00 AM on April 3rd this year, when the moon is very round, that is, at the time of the full moon (wan), a total lunar eclipse will occur; it will be visible throughout China. Regarding solar and lunar eclipses, various legends existed in ancient times in all countries of the world; even now in our country, superstitious legends such as "heavenly dogs eating the moon" and "giant toad spirits eating the moon" still circulate among the people. Therefore, whenever a lunar eclipse occurs, everyone uses methods such as banging gongs, drums, and basins to scare away the heavenly dog that eats the moon, so that it spits out the moon and returns it to us. Now that science is developed, we already know that solar and lunar eclipses are not accidental events, but celestial phenomena that inevitably occur according to the laws of nature, and are not related to good or bad fortune.
    In order to clearly understand the cause of lunar eclipses, let's first do an experiment with light and shadows. In front of a bright lamp with a large light-emitting surface, place two balls made of leather that are smaller than the lamp and of different sizes (Figure 1). The lamp represents the sun, the large ball represents the Earth, and the small ball represents the moon. Arrange the lamp and the two balls in a straight line, and place the large ball (Earth) between the lamp (Sun) and the small ball (Moon). Therefore, the large ball blocks the light of the lamp, casting a long shadow behind it. At this time, the small ball is exactly within the shadow of the large ball, and the small ball (Moon) becomes dark and lightless.
    We know that the moon, like the Earth, does not emit light itself; its light comes from the sun. That is to say, it reflects the light that the sun projects onto it to the ground, which is the moonlight we see. When the moonlight is bright and clear, if something blocks the sunlight, the moon becomes dark. At the same time, we know that the Earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the Earth, and accompanies the Earth to revolve around the sun. Therefore, sometimes the Earth and the moon will move to be in a straight line with the sun, and the Earth happens to be located between the sun and the moon (Figure 2), which is the same as the arrangement of the large and small balls and the lamp in our experiment. At this time, the moon is exactly in the shadow of the Earth, that is to say, the Earth blocks the sunlight, preventing it from reaching the moon, and the moon becomes dark, so a lunar eclipse occurs. If the moon can completely enter the Earth's shadow, a total lunar eclipse occurs. If only part of the moon is obscured by the Earth's shadow, a partial lunar eclipse occurs. The details of the total lunar eclipse on April 3rd are reported as follows:
    First contact (the moon begins to enter the Earth's shadow): 3:09 AM on the 3rd.
    Totality (the moon is completely within the Earth's shadow): 3:30 AM on the 3rd.
    Greatest eclipse (the moon is in the center of the Earth's shadow): 3:44 AM on the 3rd.
    Egress (the moon begins to emerge from the Earth's shadow): 3:59 AM on the 3rd.
    Final contact (the moon completely emerges from the Earth's shadow): 6:19 AM on the 3rd.
    We know that the moon enters the Earth's shadow when the sun and moon are opposite each other on opposite sides of the Earth, which is at the time of the full moon. Therefore, lunar eclipses always occur at the time of the full moon (around the 15th day of the lunar month). If the Earth's orbit around the sun and the moon's orbit around the Earth are in the same plane, then a lunar eclipse would occur every month at the time of the full moon. However, because the two orbital planes intersect at an angle of five degrees, the sun, moon, and Earth are not necessarily in a straight line every time there is a full moon, so a lunar eclipse may not occur. In addition to the lunar eclipse on April 3rd this year, there will be another total lunar eclipse at 12:21 PM on September 26th, but it will not be visible in our country. (Attached pictures)

### 月食是怎样发生的

　　月食是怎样发生的
    薛琴访
    今年四月三日晨三时至六时之间，正当月亮很圆的时候，就是满月（望）的时候，会发生月全食的现象；我国各地都可以见到。对于日月食，世界各国在古代都有种种的传说；我国直到现在，民间还流传着什么“天狗吃月”，“大蛤蟆精吃月亮”等迷信的传说。所以每逢月食大家都以敲锣、打鼓、击盆等方法来吓走那吃月的天狗，让它吐出月亮还给我们。现在科学发达，我们已经知道日月食不是一种偶然的事件，而是遵循自然法则必然发生的一种天象，更与吉凶祸福无关。
    为了很清楚的了解月食的原因，我们先来作一个灯光和影子的试验。在一盏光亮很强发光面很大的灯前，放两个比灯小而大小不同的皮球（第一图）。灯代表太阳，大球代表地球，小球代表月亮。将灯和两球排列在一条直线上，而且把大球（地球）放在灯（太阳）和小球（月亮）之间。因此大球遮住灯光，背后拖着一个很长的影子，这时小球刚好在大球的影子内，小球（月亮）就变得黑暗无光了。
    我们知道，月亮和地球一样，它本身并不发光，它的光是从太阳得来的。就是说它将太阳投射给它的光反射到地面上来，这就是我们所见的月光。正在月光皎洁时，如果有东西遮住太阳光，月亮就变黑暗了。同时我们知道，地球绕着太阳运行，月亮绕着地球运行，并伴随着地球一齐绕着太阳运行，因此有时候地球和月亮会走到与太阳列在一条直线上，而且地球刚巧位在太阳和月亮之间（第二图），情形和我们试验中的大小球和灯的排列一样。这时月亮恰在地球的影子中，就是说地球遮住太阳光，使其不能达到月球上去，月亮就变黑暗了，于是就发生月食。如果月亮可以完全进入地影内，就发生月全食的现象。如果月亮只有一部分被地影遮住，就发生月偏食的现象。兹将四月三日的月全食情形报告如下：
    初亏（月亮开始进入地影）三日三时○九分。
    食既（月亮完全进入地影）三日四时三○分。
    食甚（月亮走在地影正中）三日四时四四分。
    生光（月亮开始出地影）三日四时五九分。
    复圆（月亮完全出地影）三日六时一九分。
    我们知道，月亮走进地影，一定在日月相对在地球的反侧时，也就是在满月的时候。所以月食一定发生在望（约在阴历每月十五日）。如果地球绕太阳的轨道和月亮绕地球的轨道在同一平面内，则每月望都有月食发生。但因二者的轨道面交成五度之角，所以每到望，太阳、月亮、地球未必在一直线上，所以未必发生月食。今年除四月三日有月食外，九月廿六日十二时二十一分还有一次月全食，但我国看不见。（附图片）
