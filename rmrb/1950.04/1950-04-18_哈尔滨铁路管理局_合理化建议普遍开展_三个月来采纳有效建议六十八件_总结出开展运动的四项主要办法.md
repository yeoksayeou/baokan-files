　　Harbin Railway Bureau
    Rationalization Proposals Universally Carried Out
    Three Months of Adopting 68 Effective Proposals, Summarizing Four Main Methods for Carrying Out the Movement
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Harbin Railway Bureau officially promoted the rationalization proposal movement in various stations, sections, and factories on November 9th of last year, up to the end of February this year, a total of 68 effective proposals have been adopted. Among them, 33 were invention and creation proposals, 13 were proposals for improving work organization, and the remaining 22 were other proposals. The Jiamusi Inspection Section, which achieved the best results, has been awarded the title of "Banner of the Rationalization Proposal Movement" by the entire bureau. The section's trade union was awarded the title of "Model Trade Union." Summarizing the working methods of launching the rationalization proposal movement in various places, four points are worth introducing:
    (1) The management committees of each unit should study the existing shortcomings and major problems in current production, and solicit solutions to the problems from workers. This method has achieved great results in various places. For example, since the winter transport period, most of the locomotives in the Suihua Locomotive Depot have had "bypass valve" leakage, which greatly hindered on-time performance. The management committee studied it several times but was unable to find a solution. The trade union announced to the masses: "Whoever can solve the bypass valve leakage, we will report to the bureau and apply for an award for a rationalization proposal." Every worker knew the urgent difficulties to be solved on the current locomotives, so everyone actively studied solutions. Soon, Wang Fangzhou, Liu Wanjiang, and five other workers imitated and created a "bypass valve honing machine," which proved effective in trials, thus solving this difficulty, increasing the locomotive's traction force. From January to the present, 35 operating locomotives in the entire section have hauled more than 30,000 tons.
    (2) Inspire the masses to put forward suggestions for production improvement anytime and anywhere. Anyone whose proposal is adopted and effective must be commended in a timely manner; those whose proposals are inappropriate should be patiently persuaded and explained to, helping the workers' suggestions succeed, and enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses. Various methods should be used to publicize and introduce, and promote correct proposals, in order to advance the work. For example, the Nancha Construction Engineering Team wasted 66 bags of cement (a loss of 19.8 million Northeast currency) in just one month after construction began. The leadership mobilized the workers to offer opinions anytime and anywhere, which aroused the workers' attention and they began to enthusiastically study the work. In a short period of time, they put forward more than 40 rationalization proposals, and the administration adopted 24 of them, saving more than 360 million yuan in project costs.
    (3) Hold symposiums for veteran technical workers, which is the most effective and widely promoted method. For example, when the Hailun Public Works Section was repairing the waterway project in Sifangtai, because there were no pulleys, 15 people could only pull out six pipes a day. This could not complete the task according to the original plan. The trade union held a symposium for veteran workers to study the problem. As a result, worker Chen Fengshu suggested using rollers instead of hoisting, which could pull out two pipes at a time, averaging 12 pipes a day. The work efficiency was doubled, and 480 workdays were saved for 375 pipes.
    (4) Hold rationalization proposal award conferences to strengthen summarization, commendation, inspiration, education, and the introduction of experience. Most rationalization proposals are launched on the basis of rewarding inventions and creations. Giving awards and encouraging and introducing experience at mass rallies, promoting advanced working methods, makes it a weapon for the general workers to improve and enhance their work, and at the same time can motivate the masses to give play to their wisdom, initiative, and creativity, and put forward suggestions that are beneficial to production.

　　哈尔滨铁路管理局
    合理化建议普遍开展
    三个月来采纳有效建议六十八件  总结出开展运动的四项主要办法
    【本报讯】哈尔滨铁路管理局自去年十一月九日在各站、段、厂正式推广合理化建议运动以来，至今年二月末，共采纳了有效建议六八件。其中发明创造建议三三件、改进工作组织建议十三件、其他建议占二十二件。成绩最好的佳木斯检车段，已获得全局合理化建议运动旗帜的称号。该段工会被奖为“模范工会”。综合各地发动合理化建议运动的工作方法，有四点值得介绍：
    （一）由各单位的管理委员会研究当前生产中所存在的缺点及主要问题，向工友征求解决问题的办法。这个办法在各地均收到很大效果。例如：绥化机务段自冬运以来，大部机车“旁通阀”漏泄，对超轴正点有很大阻碍。管委会几次研究都是束手无策。工会就向群众发表了“谁要能解决旁通阀漏泄，我们就报局请奖为合理化建议”。每个工友都知道了当前机车上急于解决的困难，大家就纷纷研究办法。不久，王方舟、刘万江等五名工友仿造出“旁通阀削正器”，试行有效，因而解决了这一困难，增加了机车牵引力，全段由一月份至现在，三十五台运用机车多拉了三万多吨。
    （二）随时随地的启发群众对生产改进上提出建议。凡经采纳有效者必须及时表扬，不适当者应耐心说服解释，帮助工友的建议成功，提高群众情绪。并应利用各种不同方式进行宣传介绍，推广正确的建议，以便推进工作。例如南叉建筑工程队，自开工后仅一个月间，糟塌了六十六袋洋灰（损失达一九八○万元东北币，下同），领导上随时随地发动工人提意见，因此引起工友们的重视，并开始热心钻研工作，在不久的时间内，共提了四十多件合理化建议，行政上采纳了二四件，使工程省了三亿六千多万元经费。
    （三）召开老技术工人座谈会，这是收效最好、推行最广泛的一种方法。例如海伦工务段在四方台补修水道工程时，因无滑车，每天十五人能抽出六根管子。这样不能按原计划完成任务。工会就召开了老工人座谈会研究，结果由陈凤恕工友建议，用滚贡代替往上绞，一次可以抽出二根，一天平均能抽出十二根，工作效率提高一倍，三七五根管子省了四八○个工。
    （四）召开合理化建议发奖大会，以加强总结、表扬、启发、教育、介绍经验的作用。多数合理化建议是在奖励发明创造的基础上开展起来的。在群众大会上发奖鼓励、介绍经验，推广先进工作方法，使之成为一般工人群众改进与提高自己工作的武器，同时并能激动群众发挥智慧、积极性和创造性，提出有益生产的建议。
