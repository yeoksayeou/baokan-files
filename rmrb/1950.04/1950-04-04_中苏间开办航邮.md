Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: A new stage is about to begin in mail transport between China and the Soviet Union. In order to facilitate communication between the people of China and the Soviet Union and to increase the speed of mail transport, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government has consulted with the newly established Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company and reached an agreement to use the company's direct Sino-Soviet civil aviation routes to carry mail. At the same time, the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has telegraphed the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Soviet Union, requesting that its relevant post offices be informed to use Soviet domestic air routes to forward mail from China to the Soviet Union via the Sino-Soviet civil aviation route. At present, Sino-Soviet airmail is temporarily limited to letters. The airmail postage from China to the Soviet Union will be charged an additional 12,700 yuan per ten grams on top of the ordinary international postage, for a total of 15,800 yuan. Sino-Soviet air parcel services will also be opened soon.

　　中苏间开办航邮
    【新华社三日讯】我国和苏联间的邮件运输，将进入一个新阶段。中央人民政府邮电部为便利中苏两国人民通信和增加邮运速率起见，已与新近成立的中苏民用航空股份公司洽妥，利用该公司经营的中苏民用直达航空线，带运邮件。同时我中央邮电部已经电请苏联邮电部转知所属有关邮局，将我国经由中苏民用航线运往苏联的邮件，利用苏联国内航线转运。目前中苏航邮暂以信函为限。我国境内寄往苏联的航信资费，除普通国际邮费外，每十公分暂加收航空资费一万二千七百元，合共一万五千八百元。中苏航空包裹业务不久亦将开办。
