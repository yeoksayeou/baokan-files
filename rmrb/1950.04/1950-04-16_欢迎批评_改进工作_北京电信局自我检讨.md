　　Welcomed Criticism · Improvement Work
    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Self-Criticism Editor:
    People's Garden published a letter from Comrade Wang Fushan of the Political Department of the First Regiment of the Beijing Public Security Headquarters on March 24th, entitled "The Work Efficiency of the Third Sub-bureau of the Beijing Telephone Bureau Must Be Improved." On April 8th, it published Comrade Wang Fushan's correction and self-criticism of this letter. After the first publication of Comrade Wang Fushan's letter, this bureau immediately conducted a thorough inspection and found that this work did indeed have serious shortcomings and errors: "The user originally needed four main telephones and four extension telephones, but the staff member in charge missed two main and two extension telephones when opening the work order, mistakenly writing it as two main telephones and two extension telephones. The missing telephones were not discovered until Section Chief Zhang from your team came to the bureau on the 16th to inquire." This shows that there is a serious bureaucratic style in our leadership work. We did not earnestly implement inspections of the work below. After the error occurred, it was not discovered until the user came to the bureau to inquire (if we had carefully inspected, there were several opportunities to discover the error); in addition to criticizing and educating the person involved, we also improved the review work of the work orders. Although Comrade Wang Fushan's criticism slightly deviates from the actual course of events, the basic spirit is correct and it is enlightening to our work. The statement from the leaders of the First Regiment of the Public Security Headquarters and Comrade Wang Fushan, with their serious attitude towards the problem, does not mean that we have no shortcomings, but should instead prompt every staff member engaged in the people's telecommunications industry to do their job well and earnestly take responsibility for serving the people, treating the shortcomings in their work with a serious attitude and a spirit of self-criticism.
    I remember that on March 9th, People's Garden also published Comrade Zhao Guijiang of the Printing Factory of the News Photography Bureau's criticism of our bureau. Based on the spirit of the criticism, we simplified the installation procedures. Installing a telephone now takes only three or four days instead of eight or nine days (under normal circumstances); we are still studying how to further simplify the procedures. We also welcome Comrade Wang Fushan's criticism very much.
    It can be clearly understood here that to do a good job in the people's telecommunications industry, it not only requires the subjective efforts of telecommunications workers and the courage to face their own shortcomings, but also hopes that users, especially military and government agencies, will provide us with suggestions at any time, point out our shortcomings, and help us overcome and improve. We are sincerely grateful for Comrade Zhao's suggestions and Comrade Wang Fushan's criticism from the Public Security Headquarters! Hereby, we would like to express our greatest gratitude to Comrades Zhao and Wang!
                                                  Beijing Telecommunications Bureau

### 欢迎批评·改进工作  北京电信局自我检讨

　　欢迎批评·改进工作
    北京电信局自我检讨编辑同志：
    人民园地在三月廿四日刊载了北京市公安总队一团政治部王福山同志“京市电话三分局工作效率要提高”一信，四月八日又刊出了王福山同志对他这信的更正和检讨。在第一次刊出王福山同志的信后，本局即刻进行了彻底检查，发现了这件工作确有严重的缺点与错误：“用户原需电话正机四部，副机四部，经办人员在开派工单时漏开了正副机各两具，误写为正机两部，副机两部。漏开各机直至十六日贵队张班长来局催询时才发觉。”这说明我们领导工作中存在着严重的官僚主义作风，对下面的工作没有认真实行检查，错误发生后，直至用户来局催询方才发现（只要认真检查，有数次机会可以发现错误）；我们除对当事人进行批评教育外，并对派工单的审核工作进行了改进。王福山同志所提出的批评，虽然与事实经过稍有出入，但是基本精神是对的，对我们的工作是有所启示的。公安总队一团的领导上与王福山同志对问题抱严肃态度的声明，不是说明我们没有缺点，而是更应该促成我们从事人民电信事业的每个工作人员做好自己的工作，切实负起为人民服务的责任来，以严肃的态度与自我批评的精神来对待自己工作中的缺点。
    记得三月九日人民园地上亦曾刊载新闻摄影局印刷厂赵桂江同志对本局的批评，我们就根据批评的精神简化了装机手续，装一部电话机由八、九天的时间改为三、四天就可装妥（在一般情况下）；如何使手续更能简化，我们尚在进行研究。王福山同志所提出的批评，我们同样是十分欢迎的。
    这里可以明白，要搞好人民的电信事业，不但需要电信工作者的主观努力和敢于面对自己的缺点，也希望用户尤其是军政机关随时给我们提供意见，指出我们的缺点，帮助我们克服改善。像赵同志的建议及公安总队王福山同志的批评，我们是衷心地感激！在此谨向赵王两位同志致最大的谢意！
                                                  北京电信局
