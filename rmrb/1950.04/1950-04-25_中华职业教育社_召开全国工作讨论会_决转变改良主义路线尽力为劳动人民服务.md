Everyone studied the policies of the People's Government, connected them to their own work, and reviewed the work line, stance, policies, tasks and systems of the China Vocational Education Society, thereby determining the direction of future efforts. Everyone unanimously agreed that the China Vocational Education Society should transform from the reformist line of the past 33 years to the people's revolutionary line; the stance of the China Vocational Education Society should also change from that of the bourgeoisie to that of the laboring people. The future work policy of the China Vocational Education Society is to, under the leadership of the People's Government, first grasp the government's policies, closely coordinate the China Vocational Education Society's business with the government's overall plan, strengthen existing work, and move forward steadily, so as to contribute the private undertakings cultivated over many years to the people's own government in a planned way, becoming a component part of the national education system. The current task of the China Vocational Education Society is to focus on technical education and spare-time education, with particular emphasis on spare-time education. The conference unanimously and enthusiastically passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao. The meeting also invited Premier Zhou to give instructions. In addition to a detailed analysis of the international situation and domestic conditions, Premier Zhou encouraged the society to connect with the industrial and commercial sectors and serve the laborers. Finally, the meeting passed a document entitled "Our Direction," announcing the results of the meeting to members and the public, and decided to summarize the content of the meeting and convey it to all affiliated units. The various decisions of the meeting have been approved by the Standing Council of the Society at its third meeting on April 19th and will be implemented separately.
