Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 31st: The first Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference, acting on behalf of the Provincial People's Congress, was held from the 12th to the 26th of this month. Four hundred and forty-nine representatives from various regions, government departments, democratic parties, people's organizations, military units, institutions, minority nationalities, religions, and other democratic figures attended. The conference listened to, discussed, and approved three reports: Chairman Cheng Zihua of the Provincial People's Government on "The Guiding Principles and Tasks of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government in 1950," First Vice Chairman Pei Lisheng of the Provincial People's Government on "The Work of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government in the Past Six Months" and "The 1950 Budget Estimates for Revenue and Expenditure of Shanxi Province." The conference also reviewed and discussed proposals. Finally, after thorough deliberation and consultation, the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government were elected and are being submitted to the Government Administration Council for appointment and then to the Central People's Government Committee for approval. The conference also elected Cheng Zihua as Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, Lai Ruoyu, Deng Chumin, Wang Shiying, and Liu Shaobai as Vice-Chairmen, and forty members. The conference unanimously resolved to endorse the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on unifying national financial and economic work, guaranteeing its thorough implementation, and also passed eight telegrams, including one to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu expressing respect.

The guiding principles of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government for 1950, as approved by the conference, are: to further consolidate the great unity of the people of the province, strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, stabilize social order; vigorously restore production, practice strict economy, overcome financial and economic difficulties, thereby supporting the impending final victory of the Liberation War, and strive to restore industrial and agricultural production to pre-war levels within two years. Based on these principles, the conference determined eight specific tasks regarding industrial and agricultural production, finance and taxation, culture and education, and political power construction, with production and construction as the overriding central task. In industrial production, the first priority is to ensure the completion of the production tasks of state-owned industries; consolidate and strengthen the foundation of existing provincial-run industries, give full play to the production capacity of existing machinery based on the supply of raw materials and market needs, and appropriately develop industries closely related to agriculture. In agricultural production, the old liberated areas are required to restore production to pre-war levels this year, and the newly liberated areas should reach 85% of pre-war production levels, completing the central task of increasing grain production by five million shi and planting two million two hundred thousand mu of cotton. The conference also called on cadres at all levels to make their best efforts to do a good job in spring plowing in order to lay the foundation for the arduous task of restoring agricultural production this year. The conference thoroughly discussed and reviewed the 1950 budget estimates for revenue and expenditure of Shanxi Province. In order to make the representatives understand the current financial and economic policies of the Central People's Government, the conference specially issued seven relevant documents, including the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," the People's Daily editorial "Why Unify National Financial and Economic Work," and the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" as a basis for discussing financial issues. After repeated discussions, the representatives not only understood the general principles of the Central People's Government in determining the financial budget for each province and the specific allocation of the province's finances, but also recognized the difficulties in realizing the province's financial budget and the ways to overcome these difficulties, believing that this budget fully conforms to the basic spirit of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" and the actual situation of the province, and expressed unanimous support. Some representatives from government agencies voluntarily withdrew requests for increased funding and expanded staffing, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors voluntarily withdrew proposals to reduce industrial and commercial taxes and made self-criticisms. The conference also passed a resolution supporting the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council.

The conference was filled with an atmosphere of unity and harmony from beginning to end and fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic consultation. The Provincial People's Government's report to the conference on its work in the past six months and the report on the guiding principles and tasks for 1950 were supplemented and revised by the Preparatory Committee of the People's Representatives Conference from All Circles, and then discussed in groups and in plenary sessions for five days. The government made further supplements and revisions based on the correct opinions of the representatives. Regarding the handling of proposals, the conference received a total of 570 proposals, of which three were submitted to the conference for discussion, and the rest were handed over to the relevant departments of the Provincial People's Government for handling and explanation. According to the proposals and the reflections in the conference discussions, the issues of greatest concern to people of all strata were taxation, financial prices, cadre style, land reform in the new areas, and marriage policies. Government representatives adopted an attitude of conscientious study and self-criticism towards these opinions. In particular, the representatives of the Communist Party made profound self-criticisms in their speeches at the conference regarding the deviations in the implementation of land reform policies by some party member cadres and the undesirable tendencies of commandism and departmentalism in their ideological style; at the same time, they also appropriately criticized the erroneous understanding of land reform by individual representatives, which gave the participating representatives a very deep impression. In terms of elections, the conference adopted a democratic approach, submitting a list of candidates, which was then jointly consulted by the presidium and the chief representatives of each unit based on the opinions of all parties, before holding the election. All representatives were unanimously satisfied with the election results, believing that the new Provincial People's Government Committee and the Consultative Committee embodied the spirit of great unity of the province and were truly lean and capable leadership institutions. At the closing of the conference, many worker and peasant representatives felt that they had truly become masters of the country, with some saying, "This is truly the people's democratic dictatorship!" Some democratic figures also expressed their feelings, saying, "This conference is worlds apart from the provincial assemblies and senates convened by the reactionary ruling class in the past. The People's Government truly serves the people and truly accepts opinions from all sides."

　　代行人民代表大会职权
    山西省人民代表会议选出省府主席及委员
    通过今年省府施政方针定生产建设为中心任务
    【新华社太原三十一日电】代行省人民代表大会职权的山西省第一届各界人民代表会议，已于本月十二日至二十六日举行。出席各区域、政府、民主党派、人民团体、部队、机关、少数民族、宗教及其他民主人士等各界代表四百四十九人。会议听取、讨论和通过了省人民政府程子华主席关于“山西省人民政府一九五○年的施政方针与任务”，省人民政府裴丽生第一副主席关于“山西省人民政府六个月以来的工作”和“一九五○年山西省财政收支概算”等三个报告；审查和讨论了提案。最后，经过充分酝酿与协商，选举出了山西省人民政府主席、副主席、委员，正报请政务院任命并转请中央人民政府委员会批准。会议又选出程子华为山西省各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席，赖若愚、邓初民、王世英、刘少白为副主席以及委员四十人。大会一致决议拥护中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，保证彻底实现，并通过向毛主席、朱总司令致敬等电文八件。
    大会通过的一九五○年山西省人民政府的施政方针是：进一步巩固全省人民大团结，加强人民民主专政，安定社会秩序；大力恢复生产，厉行节约，战胜财政经济困难，以此支援行将最后胜利的解放战争，并争取两年内恢复工农业生产达到战前水平。依此方针，大会确定了关于工业农业生产、财政税收、文化教育、政权建设等八项具体任务，而以生产建设为压倒一切的中心任务。在工业生产上，首先要保证国营工业生产任务的完成；整顿与充实现有省营工业的基础，根据原料供给和市场需要，发挥现有机器生产能力，并适当发展和农业有密切关系的工业。在农业生产上，要求老区今年恢复到战前生产水平，新区达到战前生产水平的百分之八十五，完成增产五百万石粮食和种植二百二十万亩棉花的中心任务。大会并号召各级干部必须用最大的力量，做好春耕工作，以便为今年恢复农业生产的艰巨任务奠定基础。大会详尽地讨论和审查了一九五○年山西省财政收支概算。为了使代表们明了中央人民政府目前的财经政策，大会特印发了政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”、人民日报社论“为什么要统一国家财政经济工作”和“中共中央关于统一国家财政经济工作的通知”等七个有关文件作为讨论财政问题的根据。到会代表经过反复讨论后，不但了解了中央人民政府确定各省财政概算的总原则和全省财政具体分配情况，而且认识到实现全省财政概算的困难及战胜困难的办法，认为这一概算完全符合中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”的基本精神和本省的实际情况，表示一致拥护。有的机关代表自动撤回了增加经费、扩大编制的要求，工商界代表自动撤消了减轻工商业税的提案，作了自我批评。大会还作出拥护中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”的决议。
    会议自始至终充满了团结融洽的气氛，并充分发挥了民主协商的精神。省人民政府向大会所作的六个月来的工作报告和一九五○年的施政方针和任务的报告，除在各界人民代表会筹委会上作了补充和修正外，又经大会以五天的时间进行了小组和大会讨论。政府根据代表们的正确意见再次作了补充和修改。在提案处理上，大会共收到提案五百七十件，除三件提交大会讨论外，其余均交省人民政府各有关部门处理和解释。根据提案及会议讨论中的反映，各阶层人民最关心的是税收、金融物价、干部作风、新区土地改革和婚姻政策等问题。政府代表对这些意见，采取了虚心研究与自我批评的态度。尤其是共产党代表在大会发言中，对一部分党员干部在执行土改政策中所发生的偏向以及思想作风上所存在着的命令主义和本位主义等不良倾向，作了深刻的自我批评；同时，也适当地批判了个别代表对土地改革的错误认识，给与会代表以极深的印象。在选举方面，会议采取了民主的方式，提出候选人名单，最后由主席团与各单位首席代表，根据各方面的意见，共同协商，再举行选举。全体代表对选举结果，一致感到满意，认为新的省人民政府委员会和协商委员会，体现了全省民主大团结的精神并且是真正精干有力的领导机构。会议闭幕时，许多工农代表感到自己真正作了国家的主人翁，有的说：“这才真是人民民主专政啦！”有的民主人士也发表感想说：“这次会议与过去反动统治阶级所召开的省议会、参议会有天渊之别。人民政府是真正给人民办事的，而且是真正接受各方面意见的。”
