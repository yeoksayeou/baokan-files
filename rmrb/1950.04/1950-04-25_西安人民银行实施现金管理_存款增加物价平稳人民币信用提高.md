　　Xi'an People's Bank Implements Cash Management
    Increased Deposits, Stable Prices, Increased Renminbi Credit
    [Our Dispatch] Special Correspondent Lin Wei reports: Since the Xi'an branch of the People's Bank of China began implementing cash management, regular deposits have increased from 80 billion to 120 billion, an increase of 50 percent, achieving the task assigned by the central government. The scope of cash management currently only covers the larger institutions directly under the Northwest Administrative Region, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an City. It is estimated that the bank's deposits will further increase after full implementation in the future. At present, the major institutions in Xi'an only control cash for no more than three days' needs. Purchases of items within the budget must first be made at trade companies, and large transactions must be transferred through the bank instead of using cash. Some units that previously deposited in private banks have now begun to transfer their deposits to the People's Bank of China. When the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee recently issued loans, it meticulously prepared a cash usage plan in advance, in accordance with regulations, specifying the various items, amounts, and times, locations, and methods of using the funds. After review and approval by the Northwest Finance Committee, the funds were disbursed. When the bank makes payments, it implements transfers (without collecting remittance fees) according to the locations and institutions of fund use on the cash usage plan, to avoid transporting cash as much as possible. In order to control more cash, the bank is also preparing to launch half-year prize-winning real-value savings, initially planned for 100,000 units, totaling 600 to 700 million yuan. In terms of collection and payment services, the bank has established railway and trade treasuries in February and March, respectively, and the telecommunications treasury officially began operations on April 15. According to regulations, revenue agencies in each system report the amount of cash deposited into the treasury by telephone to the bank every evening. No payments are made without the payment order of the highest-level authority. From February 11 to April 13, statistics from the railway treasury show that cash transferred to the treasury reached 25 billion yuan. In addition, the bank also handles revenue and expenditure for units such as Xinhua Bookstore. Shaanxi Province is preparing to establish 88 treasuries. As of the 10th, 57 branches that were originally established have established accounting relationships with relevant units and are officially collecting payments. The remaining 31 will also begin operations soon. In order to adapt to the new situation, the bank is currently negotiating contracts with various institutions and units to simplify the business procedures for deposits and remittances, so that everyone can obtain convenience as much as possible while complying with the system. Internally, the bank is conducting in-depth inspections of the remnants of various bureaucratic ideologies and work styles, and establishing the idea of serving the people.
    With strict cash management, and financial authorities tightening up tax collection tasks, prices in Xi'an have begun to enter a state of stability unprecedented in more than a decade. The phenomenon of rushing to buy goods has disappeared, and people are saving Renminbi. Most of the deposits in the People's Bank have become monetary deposits, and few people are willing to save in real-value deposits. Ordinary citizens used to often hoard flour at home, but now they no longer buy and hoard it. In the past, villagers who came to the city to sell grain and cotton would immediately buy goods and spend the remaining money, but now they are willing to take the money home. The black market price of silver dollars has fallen from 25,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan per dollar. Merchants who have been accustomed to speculation for more than a decade are now scratching their heads and considering new ways out.

　　西安人民银行实施现金管理
    存款增加物价平稳人民币信用提高
    【本报讯】特派记者林韦报道：中国人民银行西安分行开始实施现金管理以来，经常存款由过去的八百亿增至一千二百亿元，增加了百分之五十，已达成中央给予的任务。实施现金管理的范围，现在还仅及西北行政区、陕西省及西安市直属之较大机关，将来全面实施后，估计该行存款还可增加。现住西安之各大机关，自己只掌握不超过三天所需之现金。购买预算范围以内之物品，须首先到贸易公司去买，大宗者必须在银行转账，不用现款。有的单位过去在私营行庄存款者，现已开始移解该行。西北军政委员会农林部最近发放贷款时，已按照规定，事先详细编造现金使用计划，说明用款的各种项目、数目及用款的时间、地点、用法等。经西北财委会审核批准，然后支拨。银行付款时，是按照现金使用计划上的用款地点与机关，实行汇拨（不收汇费），尽量避免运现（运输现金）。为更多掌握现金，该行并准备举办半年为期的有奖折实储蓄，初步计划为十万个单位，计六、七亿元。在代收代付业务方面，该行已于二、三月份分别建立铁路、贸易金库，电信金库亦于四月十五日正式开始办公。各该系统之各地收入机关，已按照规定每晚向该行电话报告入库现款。不得其最高上级之支付命令，概不支付。铁路金库自二月十一日至四月十三日统计，解库现金已达二百五十亿元。此外由该行代办收支者，尚有新华书店等单位。陕西全省准备建立八十八个金库，至十日止，五十七处原来建有支行的，均已与有关单位建立会计往来，正式收款。其余三十一处，亦即将开始办公。为适应新的情况，该行现正与各机关单位陆续商订合同，简化存、拨款项之业务手续，使大家在遵守制度之条件下尽量获得方便。银行内部则在深入检查各种官僚主义思想作风之残余，建立为人民服务的思想。
    严格管理现金，财政机关又抓紧了税收任务，西安市的物价开始步入十多年来所未有的稳定状态。抢购物资的现象没有了，人民币有人储存了。人民银行的存款，大部分都成了货币存款，愿意折实储蓄的人很少了，一般市民过去家里时常积存面粉，现在都不再购买积存了。乡民过去来城卖了粮、棉，马上都买了货，再将余钱吃掉，现在也愿带着票子回家了。黑市白洋每枚已由两万五千元落到一万五千元。十多年来习惯了做投机生意的商人，现在搔着头皮考虑新的出路了。
