Welcome Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation Beneficial to China's Economic Construction

　　China and the Soviet Union signed the following three agreements on March 27: the Agreement on the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint-Stock Company in Xinjiang, the Agreement on the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Ferrous and Rare Metals Joint-Stock Company in Xinjiang, and the Agreement on the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint-Stock Company. This is an encouraging good news for our country's economic construction during the current difficult period. Every practical patriot knows that these agreements have made a good start for the major task of utilizing foreign capital and technology to develop economic construction in our country under the principle of complete equality and mutual benefit. From this, we can not only hope for the development of Xinjiang's rich resources and the rise of China's civil aviation industry, but also the bright future of general economic cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and other friendly countries.

　　Our country has now basically won military and political victories, therefore, the arduous task of economic construction, the arduous task of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, is increasingly becoming our main topic. To develop industry, we need huge investments. Where does the funding come from? Of course, the vast majority must rely on domestic sources, in addition to confiscating confiscable bureaucratic capital, it is to rely on the profits of state-owned enterprises and state-owned trade, rely on the state's public grain and taxes, rely on the state and the people's savings. However, because the income of existing state-owned enterprises is temporarily far from enough to pay for its required expenditures, because state-owned trade, especially foreign exports, is still very undeveloped due to insufficient production conditions and transportation conditions, because the state's public grain, taxes, and people's savings still have to be used for war and other non-profit purposes while the war has not ended, due to all of this, our industrial investment is temporarily subject to great restrictions. In such a difficult period of transition, it is important to absorb foreign capital to participate in our country's economic construction under equal and mutually beneficial conditions.

　　The three economic cooperation agreements concluded between China and the Soviet Union are only a beginning, but a good and encouraging beginning. This is because these three agreements appear in today's difficult period when foreign aid is most needed. This is because these three agreements involve Xinjiang, a region extremely far from the center of China, with extremely difficult transportation and extremely backward economy, and involve the search, exploration, mining and smelting projects of non-ferrous metals, rare metals and petroleum, which may only be profitable after many years of huge investment, as well as the civil aviation industry, which is difficult to profit from. And most importantly, it is because these three agreements all aim to develop China's economic construction, both respect China's sovereignty and ensure that China and the Soviet Union are in a completely equal position in cooperation.

　　Some people raise the question: should it be allowed to use foreign capital to develop Chinese industry and to cooperate with foreign capital to establish joint-stock companies? We can fully and responsibly answer that, under appropriate conditions, this is permissible in principle. Not only with the Soviet Union, but also with other new democratic countries and even some capitalist countries, not only to establish these three joint-stock companies, but also to establish other appropriate joint-stock companies and even concessions for certain undertakings, are permissible in principle, and are sometimes needed in fact. If we do it appropriately within an appropriate scope, this will first of all be of great benefit to the Chinese people. To illustrate this, we can study Lenin's views on this issue and compare the experience of attracting foreign capital in the early days of Soviet construction with our current situation.

　　As everyone knows, the Soviet Union was surrounded by the capitalist world for a long time after the October Revolution; completely opposite to the superior conditions we have today to utilize Soviet aid, the Soviet Union at that time could only deal with its enemies. Among the many measures taken by the Soviet Union to overcome its difficulties in the early days of construction, one was to not only establish joint-stock companies with capitalist foreign countries, but also implement a concession system, that is, to lease some Soviet resources to foreign capitalists for development, and foreign capitalists would pay the Soviet Union a certain price. This policy formulated by Lenin was implemented for many years starting from 1921. The resolution on industry of the 12th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in April 1923 stated: "The experience of the past year has proved that under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, state socialist construction is allowed to allow private capital (including foreign capital) to play an active role in industry to a certain wide extent. It is necessary to continue to take a series of measures to absorb foreign capital investment in industry in all forms that have proven suitable in the past, namely, concessions, joint-stock companies, and leasing. Carefully study which industrial and enterprise sectors, and according to what principles, can be leased to foreign capital management, which is conducive to the overall economic development of the country, should be one of the most important tasks of the planning organs and the overall economic leadership organs." Although this concession system did not achieve the expected development due to the hostile policy adopted by the imperialist countries towards the Soviet Union, so that the concession funds of the Soviet Union in 1926-1927 accounted for only 0.5% of the total industrial funds, the 15th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party still pointed out when passing the resolution to formulate the Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development at the end of 1927: "As long as it can increase the economic strength of the Soviet Union, make it more free from the shackles of the capitalist world, and expand the socialist basis for the further development of industry in the Soviet Union," it should still be "allowed foreign capital to operate industry."

　　When explaining the concession system, Lenin clearly pointed out what benefits it had at that time to attract foreign capital to operate Soviet enterprises:

　　"...The lessee is the capitalist. They operate in a capitalist way, in order to obtain profits, they sign contracts with the proletarian regime, in order to obtain extra profits higher than ordinary profits... The benefits obtained by the Soviet regime are the development of productive forces, that is, to increase the amount of products immediately or in a very short period of time. For example, we have one hundred of a certain production area, mines, forest areas. We cannot exploit all of this industry - our machines, food, and means of transportation are not enough. For the same reason, the rest of the production areas, we also do not exploit well. ... Properly and prudently carrying out the concession system policy can undoubtedly help us quickly improve the production situation and improve the lives of workers and peasants..." (On the Food Tax)

　　In another place, Lenin also pointed out that attracting foreign capital to operate enterprises in the Soviet Union at that time had another important benefit, which was to learn from foreign operators the methods of managing economic businesses. This benefit can be obtained from joint-stock companies jointly operated with foreign capital. Please see how eager Lenin was to organize such joint-stock companies:

　　"...We now have some joint-stock companies. True, their number is very small. We have established nine joint-stock companies with the participation of foreign capitalists, which have been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, in addition, the committee chaired by Sokolnikov approved six, and the Northern Timber Administration also combined two. In this way, there are now seventeen joint-stock companies with several million capital and approved by the relevant authorities. (Of course, there is also sufficient chaos in our agencies, and some opportunities may be missed here.) But in any case, we now have joint-stock companies jointly operated with Russian capitalists and foreign capitalists. Their number is not large. ... But when these ordinary capitalists, both Russian and foreign, come to organize joint-stock companies with Communist Party members, we say: "We will always do something, no matter how badly these things are done, or how small the scope is, but when it comes to the beginning, we have at least achieved something." Of course, this achievement is not much; just think, we declared that we would put all our energy (people even say that our energy is great) into this undertaking, and it has been a year, but in this year, we have only established seventeen joint-stock companies." (Political Report of the Central Committee to the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party)

　　What lessons should we learn from the Soviet Union's experience in attracting foreign capital to operate enterprises?

　　The lesson is: First, for the people's regime, conditionally attracting foreign capital to participate in the operation of enterprises (and not just simple loans and hiring foreign economic and technical personnel), so as to make it "play an active role," is not only not a terrible thing, but also a beneficial and necessary thing. The Soviet Union did not lose its sovereignty and become a colony as a result, but became a world industrial power. In any case, the Soviet Union has more or less benefited from establishing joint-stock companies and implementing concession systems with the capitalist world in the process of becoming an industrial power, although this also involved some sacrifices for the Soviet Union and gave some benefits to foreign capital. Our current economic situation is even more backward than the Soviet Union's at the time Lenin spoke of. According to the statistics of 1913, the industrial production value before the Soviet Revolution accounted for 42.1% of the total industrial and agricultural production value, while today our industrial production value only accounts for about 10%, which is only a quarter of this percentage. Aren't we even more unable to exploit our many industries? Aren't we even more in need of using foreign help to "increase the amount of products immediately or in a very short period of time" and "rapidly improve the production situation and improve the lives of workers and peasants"? Aren't we even more in need of learning how to manage economic businesses and learn production technology from advanced countries? Then, when we decide to attract foreign capital to jointly operate our enterprises under certain conditions, what hesitation should we have?

　　The lesson is: Second, since attracting investment from capitalist foreign countries can still have certain benefits, then, of course, we can have even greater benefits today by attracting investment from our socialist ally, the Soviet Union. There is no doubt that, thanks to the Soviet Union as our ally, and with many new democratic countries, the conditions for us to attract foreign capital today have undergone extremely favorable and fundamental changes compared with the Soviet Union at that time. Since the Soviet Union was in the hostile encirclement of the capitalist world at that time, in order to attract foreign capital, the Soviet Union had to pay the world capitalism "extra profits higher than ordinary profits," and even so, the capitalist world was still not happy to accept the Soviet Union's demands. Our situation is different today, we have socialist and new democratic friendly allies. Our economic cooperation relationship with them, as demonstrated by the three agreements signed on March 27, is not only not a concession system, but also fundamentally different from the joint-stock companies jointly operated by the Soviet Union and foreign capitalists. China and the Soviet Union do not want to obtain "extra profits higher than ordinary profits" from each other, nor do they want the other party's investment to suffer losses. Therefore, if we "miss some opportunities" again, and do not use great energy to develop this completely new type of economic cooperation, thereby promoting the great cause of our country's economic recovery and economic construction, it would not only be stupid, but also a mistake.

　　The economic cooperation relationship between China and the Soviet Union is an equal and mutually beneficial brotherly relationship, which is different from the relationship between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, and is completely opposite from the relationship between the Chinese reactionary government and imperialist countries. This difference is fundamentally due to the fact the capitalist imperialism is an exploitative system, while the socialist economic system is a non-exploitative system.

　　In the three Sino-Soviet agreements, the Soviet Union has made important investments in our country that are conducive to the development of our country's production. For the three companies jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union, the shares undertaken by our country are land, factory buildings, and building materials for other buildings, while the shares undertaken by the Soviet Union are various mechanical equipment, industrial equipment, exploration equipment, aircraft and aviation equipment. It is very clear that, through these investments, Xinjiang's industry and civil aviation industry in our country will definitely benefit in the present or in the future, although the Soviet Union will also receive some legitimate benefits. But what was the situation of the so-called joint ventures between imperialist countries and China in the past? Imperialist countries rarely make investments in such joint ventures that are conducive to the development of production. Take the famous Kailuan Coal Mine as an example. Everyone knows that both the Kaiping and Luanxian mines were mined by China's own funds. British merchants first seized the Kaiping Mine by fraudulent means, and then merged the Luanxian Mine through the traitorous government. Relying on a majority of nominal shares, British merchants controlled the mining rights, but in fact most of their so-called shares were virtual, and they had no intention of increasing investment to develop production. Look at the so-called Chennault Air Transport Team that is still making a fuss today. The American rogue Chennault only stole the so-called relief materials as capital, and further used various "privileges" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for speculative business. He not only did not help but harmed China's civil aviation industry. Can this be considered a production investment? Imperialists are now not only not interested in investing in our country to jointly develop production, but even shrinking and destroying their existing wholly-owned production enterprises. Isn't the bombing of the American-owned power company in Shanghai by American aircraft an immediate proof?

　　Another feature of the three Sino-Soviet agreements is that both China and the Soviet Union are in a completely equal position in the three companies. The shares of both parties are not only equal at the beginning, but also guaranteed to be equal when increasing funds. The management rights and employment rights of both parties are equal, and in order to most effectively protect this equality, the three agreements stipulate a system of rotation of responsibilities. But in the so-called joint ventures of imperialist countries in China in the past, even in institutions such as customs, which are purely within the scope of China's national administration, which one was not in a legal or de facto monopoly position?

　　The third feature of the three Sino-Soviet agreements is that they fully respect our country's sovereignty. The three companies jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union will abide by all the laws of our government regarding enterprises and taxation. And what about the imperialist economic institutions that "cooperated" with the Chinese reactionary government in the past? Every such institution demanded certain privileges and tried to expand these privileges to adapt to the needs of continuing to expand its commodity market. This type of privilege was enshrined in the "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce" signed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the American government. According to this treaty, American capital should receive all preferential treatment and freedom of activity outside the scope of ordinary Chinese law throughout China. In the so-called "Sino-American Aviation Agreement," American aircraft companies were stipulated to be able to fly, land and load and unload passengers and goods throughout China. In the so-called "Sino-American Bilateral Agreement," in order to further facilitate the activities of American merchants, the Chiang Kai-shek government allowed the abolition of all commercial restrictions that American merchants were dissatisfied with, and accepted American supervision of China's financial, trade, and enterprise organizations. These are the costs of the Chinese reactionary government's "economic cooperation" with imperialist countries. This kind of "economic cooperation" obviously has nothing in common with today's Sino-Soviet economic cooperation.

　　Of course, Sino-Soviet economic cooperation is a mutually beneficial cooperation, which means that it is not only beneficial to our country and our people, but also equally beneficial to the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. This mutual benefit is necessary, because only in this way can this cooperation exist and develop, and can it conform to the brotherly relationship between two independent countries. The brotherly relationship between two independent countries should be that they have no malice towards each other, know each other's joys and sorrows, do not take advantage of each other, do not cause losses to each other, and work together for common interests. We should have such an understanding of the mutual assistance between brotherly countries, that is: all assistance within the scope of the spirit, such as the Soviet Union's construction experience, academic theories and even technological inventions, we can ask the Soviet Union to tell us and help us without compensation; but all assistance within the scope of material resources, because the Soviet Union's material resources are the labor results of the Soviet people, cannot be asked to help without compensation, but must be exchanged with equal material resources - labor results. That is to say, it must be mutually beneficial and equivalent exchange. Otherwise, it is not a brotherly mutual assistance relationship, but a relationship of dependence and exploitation. Giving gifts between brothers once or twice is possible, but a constant relationship of dependence and exploitation should not exist. Therefore, we cannot ask the Soviet Union to take machines and equipment without compensation to develop our industry without giving the Soviet Union certain legitimate benefits. We should not be exploiters or parasites, and parasites are essentially exploiters. The people of the independent, nationally self-respecting, and laboring people-based People's Republic of China can never imagine that our country should exploit the funds accumulated by the Soviet laboring people, can never imagine that the Soviet government should not be responsible for its own financial and economic situation, or imagine that the Soviet socialist economic and financial system is unregulated, and the wealth of the Soviet people is not created by labor, but flows like river water, and so on. We have used the Soviet Union's material assistance in the exploitation of Xinjiang's mineral resources and the establishment of the civil aviation industry, therefore, we allow the Soviet Union to have the right to purchase half of the mineral production and share half of the possible profits (as well as share the debts). This is precisely a fair and mutually beneficial method, and in the final analysis, our country still gets greater and longer-term benefits. On this point, imperialists who never forget to provoke will sneak in and ask: Why does the Soviet Union adopt this method that is beneficial to both China and the Soviet Union instead of adopting a method that is only beneficial to China? The imperialists' trap is this: If the Soviet Union does something that is obviously beneficial to others - "Why are you so good? You have a conspiracy." If the Soviet Union does something that is beneficial to both the Soviet Union and others - "Why do you also take care of yourself? You are selfish." But to calculate the interests of our Chinese people, we are smarter than the imperialists. Any slander from the provocateurs can never turn things that are indeed beneficial to us into unfavorable things. In the years when the imperialists were busy bombing, blockading, destroying, and harming us, in the years when we ourselves did not have the strength to develop production on a large scale, the Soviet Union helped us realize what we could not realize. From then on, the mineral resources of remote Xinjiang can be exploited, the backward economy of Xinjiang can rapidly advance, our civil aviation industry can rapidly develop, and the economic and cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union can rapidly develop! Let us cheer: Welcome this good news that is beneficial to our country's economic situation and the lives of our people! Welcome Sino-Soviet economic cooperation that is beneficial to our country!

### 欢迎有利于中国经济建设的中苏经济合作

　　欢迎有利于中国经济建设的中苏经济合作
    中苏两国在三月二十七日签订了以下三个协定：关于在新疆创办中苏石油股份公司协定，关于在新疆创办中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司的协定，关于创办中苏民用航空股份公司协定。这在我国目前困难时期的经济建设事业中是一个令人鼓舞的好消息。每一个实际的爱国者都知道，这些协定对于我国在完全平等互利的原则下利用外国资本和技术发展经济建设这一件大事，是作了一个良好的开端。我们由此不但可以希望新疆富源的开发和中国民用航空事业的兴起，而且可以希望我国与苏联和其他友好国家的一般经济合作事业的光明前途。
    我们的国家现在已经基本上赢得了军事的和政治的胜利，因此，经济建设的艰巨任务，变农业国为工业国的艰巨任务，就越来越成为我们的主要的题目了。我们要发展工业，就需要浩大的投资。资金从那里来呢？当然绝大部分必须依靠本国的来源，除开没收可以没收的官僚资本外，就是依靠国营企业和国营贸易的利润，依靠国家的公粮和税收，依靠国家和人民的节约。但是由于目前已有的国营企业的收入暂时还远不足以偿付它所需要的支出，由于国营贸易特别是对外出口在生产条件和交通条件不足的情况下还很不发展，由于国家的公粮、税收和人民的节约在战争尚未结束的情况下还不得不用于战争和其他不能赢利的用途，由于这一切，我们的工业投资暂时不能不受着极大的限制。在这样的青黄不接的困难时期，吸收外国资本在平等互利的条件下参加我国的经济建设事业，就有了它的重要性。
    中国和苏联所缔结的三项经济合作的协定，还只是一个开端，但是是一个令人鼓舞的良好的开端。这是因为，这三个协定是出现在今天这种最需要外力援助的困难时期。这是因为，这三个协定所涉及的是新疆这样离开中国中心极其遥远的和交通极其困难、经济极其落后的地区，所涉及的是要多年巨大投资才有可能得到利润的有色金属、稀有金属和石油的寻觅、探测、开采和冶炼工程，以及很难有利润的民用航空事业。而最重要的，就是因为，这三个协定都以发展中国经济建设为目的，既尊重中国的主权，又保证中苏两国在合作中完全居于平等地位。
    有人提出问题：利用外国资本来发展中国工业，和外国资本合作开办合股公司，是否应该被允许呢？我们完全可以负责地答复说：在适当的条件之下，这在原则上是许可的。不独是和苏联，就是和其他新民主国家以至某些资本主义国家，不独开办这三个合股公司，就是开办其他适当的合股公司以至某些事业的租让，在原则上都是许可的，在事实上有时也还是需要的。如果我们在适当的范围之内，并且又作得适当的话，这首先对中国人民是有很大利益的。为了说明这一点，我们可以研究一下列宁关于这个问题的见解，并用苏联建设初期吸引外国资本的经验来和我们现时的情形作一个比较。
    大家知道，苏联在十月革命以后长期间是被资本主义世界所包围的；与我们今天可以利用苏联援助的优越条件完全相反，苏联当时只能跟它的敌人打交道。苏联为了克服自己在建设初期的困难所采取的许多办法中，有一项就是不但与资本主义外国共同建立合股公司，而且实行租让制，就是把若干苏联富源租给外国资本家开发，而由外国资本家付给苏联一定的代价。列宁所制定的这个政策曾经从一九二一年起实行了好多年。一九二三年四月苏联共产党第十二次代表大会关于工业的决议说：“过去一年来的经验证明，在新经济政策条件下，国家社会主义建设在某种广大限度内是容许私人资本（其中包括外国资本）在工业方面发挥积极作用的。必须继续采取一系列的措施，用过去已经证明合适的一切形式，即租让、合股公司、出租的形式吸收外国资本投资于工业。仔细研究，究竟那些工业与企业部门，根据何种原则能够租让与外国资本经营，才有利于国家整个经济发展等问题，应当是计划机关与经济总领导机关最重要的任务之一。”虽然由于帝国主义国家采取敌视苏联的政策，这种租让制并没有达到预期的发展，因而在一九二六年至一九二七年苏联的租让资金仅占全部工业资金百分之○·五，但是直至一九二七年底苏联共产党第十五次代表大会通过拟定国民经济五年计划的决议时，仍然指明：“只要能够增加苏联的经济力量，使它更加摆脱资本主义世界的羁绊，扩大苏联进一步发展工业的社会主义基础”，就仍然应当“允许外资经营工业”。
    列宁在解释租让制的时候明确地指出了吸引外资经营苏联企业在当时有怎样的利益：
    “……承租人，这就是资本家。他们按资本主义方式经营业务，是为了获得利润，他们与无产阶级政权订立合同，是为了获得高于普通利润的额外利润……。苏维埃政权所获得的利益，便是发展生产力，便是立刻或在极短期内，增加生产品量。譬如说，我们有一百个某种产地、矿山、林区。我们开采不了这全部产业——我们的机器、粮食、运输工具不够。因为这同样原因，其余各产区，我们也开采得不好。……恰当而审慎地进行租让制政策，这无疑是能够帮助我们迅速改良生产情况，改善工农生活……”（论粮食税）
    在另外的地方，列宁又指出吸引外资经营企业在当时的苏联还有一个重要的利益，就是向外国经营者学会管理经济业务的方法。这种利益可以从与外资合办的合股公司中得到。请看列宁对于组织这种合股公司抱着何等的热望：
    “……我们现在有了一些合股公司。诚然，它们的数量是很少的。我们创办了有外国资本家参加的九个合股公司，这些公司已经由对外贸易部批准，此外索科里尼可夫主持的委员会批准了六个，北方木料管理局也结合了两个。这样一来，现在就有十七个拥有若干百万资本、且经相当机关批准了的合股公司。（当然，在我们机关方面也有充分的混乱现象，这里也可能错过一些时机。）但无论如何，现在我们已经有了与俄国资本家和外国资本家合办的股份公司。它们的数量并不多。……可是当俄国的和国外的这班普通资本家与共产党员来组织合股公司的时候，我们就说：“我们总还会作一些事情，不管这些事情作得怎样不好，范围怎样狭小，但讲到开端这点，我们毕竟有了一点什么成绩。”当然，这成绩并不怎样多；试想想，我们宣称要把全副精力（人们竟说，我们的精力是很大的）都放到这个事业上，这已经有一年了，可是在这一年之内，我们却只创办了十七个合股公司。”（俄国共产党第十一次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告）
    从苏联吸引外资经营企业的经验中，我们应该得到什么教训呢？
    教训就是：第一，对于人民政权来说，有条件地吸引外资参加经营企业（而不仅是简单的借款和聘用外国经济技术人员），以便使其“发挥积极作用”，不但不是什么可怕的事情，而且是有利和必要的事情。苏联不但没有因此丧失主权而变为殖民地，而且是变成了世界的工业强国。无论怎样，苏联在变为工业强国的过程中曾经多多少少地获得利用了跟资本主义世界建立合股公司和实行租让制的某种利益的，虽然这对苏联也是有过一些牺牲，给了外国资本一些好处。我们今天的经济情形，比列宁所说的苏联当时的情形还要落后。苏联革命前的工业生产额，据一九一三年的统计，占全部工农业生产总额的百分之四二·一，而我国今天工业生产额只占百分之十左右，即只占这个百分比的四分之一罢了。我们不是更加开采不了我们的许多产业吗？我们不是更加需要利用外国的帮助来“立刻或在极短期内增加生产品量”，“迅速改善生产情况，改善工农生活”吗？我们不是更加需要向先进国家学会管理经济业务和学会生产技术吗？那么，当我们决定在一定条件之下吸引外资来共同经营我们的企业的时候，我们还应该有什么踌躇呢？
    教训就是：第二，既然吸引资本主义外国的投资尚且可以有某种利益，那么，我们今天吸引社会主义盟邦苏联的投资，当然就可以有更大的利益了。毫无疑义，由于有了苏联作为我们的盟邦，并且又有了许多新民主国家，我们今天吸引外资的条件比起苏联当时是发生了极有利的和根本性质的变化。苏联当时既然是处在资本主义世界的敌视的包围中，因此苏联为了吸引外资，就不能不给世界资本主义支付“高于普通利润的额外利润”，而即令如此，资本主义世界仍然并不乐于接受苏联的要求。我们今天的情形不同了，我们有了社会主义和新民主主义的友好盟邦。我们与它们的经济合作关系，如三月二十七日签订的三个协定所表现的，不但不是什么租让制，而且也跟苏联和外国资本家所合办的合股公司也有根本性质上的不同。中苏两国互相不要从对方取得“高于普通利润的额外利润”，也不要使对方的投资受到损失。因此，如果我们再“错过一些时机”，再不用极大的精力来发展这种完全新式的经济合作，因而推进我国经济恢复和经济建设的伟大事业，那就不独是愚蠢，而且是一种错误了。
    中苏两国的经济合作关系，是一种平等的互利的兄弟关系，这种关系跟苏联与资本主义国家的关系不同，跟中国反动政府与帝国主义国家的关系更是完全相反。这种区别，根本上是由于资本主义帝国主义是一种剥削制度，而社会主义的经济制度却是一种无剥削的制度。
    在中苏三个协定中，苏联都向我国作了有利于发展我国生产的重要的投资。对于中苏合营的三个公司，我国担任的股金是地段、工厂房屋及其他建筑物的建筑材料等项，而苏联担任的股金却是各种机械装备、工业器材、探测器材、飞机及航空器材等项。十分明显，经过这些投资，我国的新疆工业和民用航空事业无论在目前或将来都会得到确切不移的利益，虽然苏联也将得到某些正当利益。但是帝国主义国家过去和中国的所谓合营事业的情形是怎样呢？帝国主义国家很少真正在这种合营事业中作有利于发展生产的投资。拿著名的开滦煤矿来说吧。人们都知道，开平和滦县两矿都是中国自己出资开采的，英国商人始则用欺骗手段霸占了开平矿，继而又经卖国政府合并了滦县矿。英国商人依靠名义上的股金占多数而操纵着矿权，实则他们的所谓股金大部分却是虚拟的，他们也无意于增加投资以发展生产。再看看至今还在喧闹着的所谓陈纳德空运队吧。美国流氓陈纳德不过是盗窃了所谓救济物资作为资本，并进一步利用蒋介石匪帮的各种“特许”作投机生意罢了。他不但没有帮助而且危害了中国的民航事业。难道这也算得是生产的投资吗？帝国主义者现在不但对于投资我国以共同发展生产不感兴趣，甚至对于已经存在的他们的独资生产事业也在收缩和破坏，美国飞机之轰炸上海美商电力公司不就是眼前的证明吗？
    中苏三个协定的另一个特点就是中苏双方在三个公司中完全居于平等地位。双方的股金不但在开始时是平等的，就在增加资金时也保证是平等的。双方的管理权用人权是平等的，而且为了最确实地保障这种平等，三个协定都规定了轮流负责制。但是帝国主义国家过去在中国的所谓合营事业中，甚至在纯属中国国家行政范围的海关这类机构中，哪有不是居于法定的或事实上的独占地位的呢？
    中苏三个协定的第三个特点是完全尊重我国主权。中苏合营的三个公司将遵守我国政府关于企业和税收的一切法令。而过去与中国反动政府“合作”的帝国主义经济机关呢？每一个这样的机关都要求一定的特权，并力图扩大这种特权以适应继续扩大其商品市场的需要。这类特权规定蒋介石匪帮与美国政府所签订的“中美商约”中达到了集大成的程度。按照这个条约，美国资本在中国全境应当受到中国普通法律范围以外的一切优待和活动的自由。在所谓“中美航空协定”中，美国飞机公司被规定为可以在中国全境飞行、着陆和载卸客货。在所谓“中美双边协定”中，为了进一步便利美国商人的活动，蒋介石政府允许废除美国商人所不满意的一切商务限制，并接受美国对于中国财政金融贸易和企业组织的监督。这些就是中国反动政府与帝国主义国家实行“经济合作”的代价。这种“经济合作”与今天的中苏经济合作，显然没有任何共同之点。
    当然，中苏经济合作是一种互利的合作，这就是说，它不但有利于我国和我国人民，也同样有利于苏联和苏联人民。这种互利是必需的，因为只有这样，这种合作才能存在和发展，也才能符合于两个独立国家的兄弟关系。两个独立国家的兄弟关系，应该是互相没有恶意，互相知道彼此的甘苦，互相不占对方的便宜，不使对方受损失，从而为共同利益协力奋斗。对于兄弟之邦的互相帮助，我们应该有这样一种认识，即：凡属于精神范围内的帮助，例如苏联的建设经验，学术理论乃至技术发明等，我们可以要求苏联无代价地告诉我们，帮助我们；但是属于物质资财范围内的帮助，因为苏联的物质资财是苏联人民的劳动成果，则不能要求苏联无代价地帮助，而必须用相等的物质资财——劳动成果去交换。就是说，必须是互利的，等价交换的。否则，就不是一种兄弟互助关系，而成为一种依赖关系和剥削关系了。兄弟之间，一次二次赠与是可以有的，但经常的依赖关系和剥削关系却不应该有。因此，我们不能要求苏联无代价地拿来机器设备发展我们的工业，而不给苏联一定的正当的利益。我们不应该做剥削者或寄生者，而寄生者实质上自然也就是剥削者。独立的、富有民族自尊心的、以劳动人民为主体的中华人民共和国的人民，决不能设想我们的国家应当去剥削苏联劳动人民所积累的资金，决不能设想苏联政府应当对本国的财政经济状况不负责任，或者设想苏联的社会主义经济财政制度是无规律的，苏联人民的财富不是劳动所创造，而是像河水一样流来的，等等。我们在开采新疆矿藏和创办民用航空事业中利用了苏联的物质援助，因此我们允许苏联有权购买矿产的一半，并分享可能的利润的一半（和分担亏欠一样）。这正是一种公平的互利的办法，而且归根结底，还是我国得到了更大的更长远的利益。关于这一点，永远不忘记挑拨的帝国主义者钻进来发问道：苏联为什么要采取这种有利于中苏双方的办法而不采取仅仅有利于中国的办法呢？帝国主义者的圈套就是这样的：如果苏联做了一件显然有利于旁人的事——“你为什么这样好呢？你有阴谋。”如果苏联做了一件既有利于苏联又有利于旁人的事——“你为什么也顾到自己呢？你自私自利。”但是要计算我们中国人民自己的利益，究竟是我们比帝国主义者高明一些。挑拨者的任何中伤，永远不能使确实于我们有利的事变为不利。在帝国主义者忙于轰炸封锁破坏陷害我们的岁月，在我们自己还没有力量大规模发展生产的岁月，苏联帮助我们实现了我们所不能实现的东西。从此以后，遥远的新疆的矿藏可以开采了，落后的新疆的经济可以迅速前进了，我们的民用航空事业可以迅速发展了，中苏两国的经济文化交流可以迅速发展了！让我们欢呼吧：欢迎这个有利于我国经济情势和我国人民生活的好消息！欢迎有利于我国的中苏经济合作！
