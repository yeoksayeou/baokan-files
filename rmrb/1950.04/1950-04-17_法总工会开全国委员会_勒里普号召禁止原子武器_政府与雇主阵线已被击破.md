Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 16th Dispatch from TASS: The National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) held a meeting in Paris on the 13th. CGT General Secretary Le Léap made a report on the struggle of the French working people to win economic demands and peace.

	Le Léap pointed out the drastic decline in the living standards of the working people and the continuous rise in prices, and emphasized that between 1938 and 1949, the profits of French capitalists had increased 43 times. He also pointed out that at present, there are 500,000 fully or partially unemployed people in France, 300,000 more than last year. Speaking of the recent strike involving more than one million French working people, Le Léap said: "Despite the heinous cooperation between the government and employers, and despite the conspiracies of those who divide the unity of the working class, the working people have still achieved significant victories in this struggle. They have achieved victories in more than 2,000 large, medium, and small enterprises. The employers' front has been broken, the strength of the CGT is growing, and the struggle is continuing."

	A large part of the report was devoted to the struggle of the working people for peace, which is closely related to their struggle for economic demands. Le Léap called on all trade union organizations and their members affiliated with the CGT to make every effort to collect signatures for the World Peace Council's appeal to ban atomic bombs.

	The National Committee meeting of the CGT continued on the 14th.

　　法总工会开全国委员会
    勒里普号召禁止原子武器  政府与雇主阵线已被击破
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总工会全国委员会于十三日在巴黎举行会议。总工会总书记勒里普就法国劳动人民争取经济要求与和平的斗争作了报告。
    勒里普指出了劳动人民生活水准的剧烈下降及物价的不断上升，并着重说明自一九三八年到一九四九年间，法国资本家的利润已增加了四十三倍。他又指出，在目前，法国有五十万全失业或半失业者，比去年多三十万。谈到最近有一百多万法国劳动人民参加的罢工时，勒里普说：“尽管政府与雇主之间的万恶合作，尽管分裂工人阶级团结的人们的阴谋，劳动人民在这一斗争中仍然获得了显著的胜利，他们在二千多家大、中、小企业中都获得了胜利，雇主的阵线被打破了，总工会的力量日益强大，斗争在继续进行中”。
    报告中有很大一部分专门论述劳动人民争取和平的斗争，这一斗争是与他们的争取经济要求的斗争密切相关的。勒里普号召总工会所属一切工会组织及其成员，尽一切努力为和大常委会禁止原子弹的呼吁书征集签名。
    总工会全国委员会会议于十四日继续举行。
