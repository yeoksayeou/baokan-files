Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 1st—Leading officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang from various locations, who came to Lanzhou on official business, were extremely excited upon learning of the Sino-Soviet agreement to establish two joint-stock companies for petroleum and non-ferrous metals. They unanimously stated that the establishment of these two companies would be a great encouragement to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and all the people of Xinjiang, who are currently actively engaged in production and construction. The economic cooperation between the great Soviet Union and our country will further accelerate the development of our country's industry. After hearing the news, Ma Erguofu (former general of the National Army, of the Tatar ethnicity), deputy commander of a certain army stationed in Yili, immediately asked a translator to explain the full text of the communique to him in detail using the newspaper. He believes that the signing of the agreement to establish two Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies will greatly help the exploitation of Xinjiang's abundant resources and the development of Xinjiang's heavy industry and transportation. He said that Xinjiang is vast, and transportation between regions was very difficult in the past due to a lack of gasoline; in the future, we will gradually improve this situation. He also expressed great satisfaction with the provision that the personnel in charge of the two companies would be rotated every three years. He said that this is a concrete manifestation of equality and mutual benefit. He Jiaju and Cui Jingmo, the logistics ministers of a certain corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, took out maps showing the distribution of minerals in Xinjiang to study. In addition to thanking the Soviet Union for sincerely helping our country in its construction, they are filled with infinite confidence in building the future industrialized New China.
Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st—People from all walks of life in Xi'an warmly support the Sino-Soviet agreement to jointly establish two joint-stock companies in Xinjiang. Ma Mingfang, chairman of the Xi'an branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, stated in a speech that this agreement marks a further step in the concretion of the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the close unity of the two peoples. The establishment of these two companies is directly related to China's industrial construction and the prosperity of the national economy. Establishing the metallurgical industry and the oil extraction industry can solve the problem of raw materials and fuel for the industrial construction of New China, especially paving a smooth road for the gradual transition of the agricultural Northwest to industrial construction. This is a major event in the Northwest construction cause. This fact once again demonstrates that the Soviet Union's friendly assistance to China is essentially different from any aggressive treaty of exploitation and monopoly by imperialism in the past. Only the Soviet Union is the only most loyal and reliable friend of the Chinese people.
Wang Dacheng, Minister of Industry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, said: The exploitation of petroleum and non-ferrous metals will not only play a great role in the development of industrial construction in the Northwest but also have a significant meaning in our national defense industrial construction. The great friendship of the Soviet Union has strengthened our confidence in construction, and we must strive to do all our work well.
The person in charge of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League said: This agreement, which has significant economic construction and historical significance, will play a great role in the economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the future, and the construction of the Great Northwest will be laid a foundation from now on. We fully support this agreement, which is based on the broad interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union.
Hou Zonglian, deputy director of the Northwest Branch of the Preparatory Committee of the First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China, said: The establishment of these two companies has given our Northwest scientific workers the opportunity to learn from Soviet science and production construction. We should strive to learn technology to respond to the assistance of our friendly neighbor, the Soviet Union.
The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions believes that the establishment of these two companies will enable more workers in the Northwest to have the opportunity to receive the advanced technology of Soviet friends, so as to better build the Great Northwest. Our trade union workers will widely publicize to the working masses and warmly support this correct agreement on behalf of the workers in the Northwest.
Luo Yi, secretary of the Northwest Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, called on the youth in the Northwest to improve their understanding and learn the knowledge of construction. The opening of these two companies has encouraged our youth's confidence and strength in building the Great Northwest. The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Democratic Women's Federation also expressed on behalf of all women in the Northwest that they will work hard to realize this agreement in their active work.
Yue Jieheng, a professor at Northwest University, said in a speech: Chairman Mao once said: "In the era of imperialism, it is impossible for the true people's revolution in any country to achieve its own victory without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways. It is also impossible to consolidate after victory." Therefore, it is entirely necessary for our country to cooperate with international friendly countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance to build industry.

　　新疆西安旅大等地人民
    热烈拥护中苏合办公司
    认为苏联的帮助将加速我国工业化
    【新华社兰州一日电】因公来到兰州的新疆各地驻军首长，获悉中苏签订创办石油及有色金属两个股份公司的协定后，兴奋异常。他们一致表示：这两个公司的创立，对目前积极从事生产建设的驻新疆的人民解放军和全新疆人民将是极大的鼓舞。伟大苏联友邦与我国的经济合作，将更加速我国工业的发展。驻伊犁的某军副军长马尔果夫（前民族军将领，塔塔尔民族）听到这个消息后，立刻要翻译人员拿着报纸详细地给他讲解公报的全文。他认为创办两个中苏股份公司的协定的签订，对于开采丰富的新疆资源、发展新疆的重工业和运输事业，都有着很大的帮助。他说，新疆地区辽阔，过去因为缺乏汽油，各地间交通十分困难；今后我们就会逐渐地改善这种情况了。他对两公司负责人员三年一调换的规定也极表满意。他说，这才是平等互惠的具体表现。新疆军区某某等兵团的后勤部长何家驹、崔景模等都翻出新疆矿产分布地图来研究。他们除感谢苏联诚心诚意帮助我国建设外，对建设未来新中国的工业化充满着无限的信心。
    【新华社西安一日电】西安市各界人士热烈拥护中苏合办新疆两个股份公司的协定。中苏友好协会西安分会理事长马明芳发表谈话称：这个协定，标志着中苏两国的友好合作和两国人民紧密团结更进一步的具体化。创办这两个公司——直接关系到中国工业的建设与国民经济的繁荣。创设冶金工业和采油工业可以给新中国的工业建设解决了原料和燃料的问题，特别是将为农业的西北逐步走向工业建设的前途开拓一条坦平的道路。这是西北建设事业中重大的事件。这一事实，再次说明苏联对中国的友好帮助，在本质上是不同于过去帝国主义压榨和垄断的任何侵略条约的。只有苏联才是中国人民唯一最忠实可靠的朋友。
    西北军政委员会工业部长王达成说：石油和有色金属的开采，不仅对西北工业建设的开展有很大作用；而且在我们国防工业建设上亦有重大意义。苏联伟大的友谊增强了我们建设的信心，我们要努力做好一切工作。
    民盟西北总支部负责人谈称：这个具有重大经济建设和历史意义的协定，对今后中苏两国的经济合作将起极大作用，大西北的建设将从此打下基础。我们完全拥护这一基于中苏两国人民广大利益需要的协定。
    中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表大会筹备委员会西北区分会副主任侯宗濂称：这两个公司的创办，给了我们西北科学工作者学习苏联科学与生产建设的机会，我们应当努力学习技术，以回答友邦苏联对我们的援助。
    西北总工会筹委会负责人认为：创办这两个公司，将使西北工人更增多接受苏联朋友进步技术的机会，以便更好地建设大西北。我们工会工作者将广泛向工人群众宣传，并代表西北工人热诚拥护这一正确的协定。
    青年团西北工作委员会书记罗毅号召西北青年必须提高认识，学习建设的知识。这两个公司的开办，鼓舞了我们青年建设大西北的信心和力量。西北民主妇联筹委会负责人也代表全西北妇女表示将在积极工作中为实现此一协定而努力。
    西北大学教授岳劼恒发表谈话称：毛主席曾经说过：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的”。因此，我国与国际友邦在平等、互利、互助的原则下合作建设工业，是完全必要的。
