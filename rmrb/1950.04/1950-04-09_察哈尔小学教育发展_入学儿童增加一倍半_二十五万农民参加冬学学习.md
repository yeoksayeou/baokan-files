Chahar's primary school education and social education work have greatly developed in the past year. The number of primary schools in the province increased from 3,028 to 4,733, and the number of enrolled children increased from 128,204 to 320,377. On average, seven out of ten administrative villages have established primary schools, and 48.6% of school-age children are enrolled. The province originally had 151 senior primary schools, which have been restored and reorganized to 154. From cities to villages, except for disaster areas in counties such as Sihai, Chicheng, and Longguan, primary school education is developing upwards. In Zhangjiakou City, the number of enrolled children before liberation was only 10,200, but it has now increased to 15,583. In the eight counties of Chabei, which originally had the weakest educational foundation, there were only 193 primary schools before liberation, but now there are 1,420. In terms of social education, winter literacy classes were universally opened in the province last year. A total of 7,199 winter schools were established, with 10,832 classes, and 252,300 farmers enrolled. Generally, winter school students learned more than 100 characters, and the best learned 500 to 600 characters. At the same time, they carried out political study, and the students knew the meaning of the national flag and national anthem, and recognized who are the friends and who are the enemies of the Chinese people. In cities such as Zhangjiakou and Datong, worker education and cadre after-school education have also been initially launched. For example, in Zhangjiakou City, since August last year, more than 800 on-the-job cadres have begun after-school cultural learning.

Main shortcomings: Some cadres underestimate education work and neglect professional study.

In order to summarize the work of the past year, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Chahar Provincial People's Government convened a meeting of education section chiefs of each special commissioner's office and municipal education bureau directors on March 20. The meeting reviewed several shortcomings that still exist in education work: First, the leadership of education work needs to be strengthened. Leading cadres in some areas do not pay enough attention to education work. Four counties in the province have not yet been equipped with education section chiefs, and some counties (such as Kangbao) want to transfer education staff members to other jobs because they see that they have a higher level of education. Some primary school teachers have been transferred away, but the education department does not know about it, which affects education work. At the same time, the leadership lacks foresight and planning. The development of school education last year had a certain degree of blindness. There was no clear plan before the central government gave instructions on how to persist in education in disaster areas, and how to preserve strength and prepare for recovery if it cannot be persisted. When arranging winter literacy classes, it was planned to combine them with primary schools, but it was not anticipated that primary school teachers would be trained after the winter vacation. The leading work did not grasp the central link, and failed to absorb typical experiences to guide the education work. For example, some counties have grasped the leadership of county supervisors and principals of central schools, which has played a great role in promoting education work, but these experiences have not been promoted and implemented. Second, not enough has been done to rely on the masses and connect with the masses to run schools. Some schools have mobilized the masses to build schools and have achieved great results. However, in many other areas, teachers are divorced from the masses, and difficulties cannot be resolved. In teaching, many teachers have also failed to listen to the opinions of children's parents and connect with reality to carry out teaching. Third, education administrative cadres and teachers neglect professional study. Cadres are busy with administrative work and lack professional leadership for teachers. They only pay attention to whether teachers are "dutiful" and how many children are enrolled, but generally ignore whether teachers have completed the teaching plan, teaching methods, and teaching effects. Even some education administrative cadres lose the courage to inspect schools because they lack professional knowledge. The cultural level of most teachers is very low, and in the past, only the political study of teachers was emphasized.

This year's plan: Consolidate and improve existing schools and gradually carry out education for workers and peasants.

Regarding these shortcomings, everyone at the meeting believed that they must be overcome in the future. The meeting also formulated an education work plan for this year based on the current situation, deciding to focus on improving and consolidating primary school education. The use of funds should be based on income and expenditure, carefully calculated, and maximize the role of limited financial resources. It also advocates that the masses, teachers, and students of the school build schools on a voluntary basis. It also emphasized the connection between schools and the masses, the connection between education and reality, and that primary schools should hold regular parent meetings and conduct home visits in a planned manner to solicit opinions from the masses and jointly run the schools well. In terms of social education, starting this year, illiteracy elimination work will be carried out in a step-by-step and planned manner in conjunction with production. First, a detailed survey of illiteracy will be conducted, and attention will be paid to enrolling out-of-school children, striving to enable young people under the age of 25 to recognize 1,000 characters within three or four years. At the same time, strengthen on-the-job cadre education and worker education; a worker-peasant school will be established on a trial basis in the first half of the year, and cadre after-school schools and worker after-school schools will be widely developed.

### 察哈尔小学教育发展  入学儿童增加一倍半  二十五万农民参加冬学学习

　　察哈尔小学教育发展  入学儿童增加一倍半
    二十五万农民参加冬学学习
    【本报讯】察哈尔省的小学教育和社会教育工作，在过去一年中已有很大发展。全省初级小学由三、○二八处增至四、七三三处，入学儿童由一二八、二○四名增至三二○、三七七名。平均十个行政村中已有七个建立了小学，百分之四十八点六的学龄儿童已入学。全省原有高级小学一五一处，经恢复整顿后已增至一五四处。从城市到乡村，除四海、赤城、龙关等县灾区外，小学教育均是向上发展的。张家口市解放前入学儿童仅一○、二○○名，现已增至一五、五八三名；察北八个县，原为教育基础最差的地区，解放前仅有小学一九三处，现已增至一、四二○处。在社会教育方面，全省去年普遍开办了冬学。共建立冬学七、一九九处，计一○、八三二班，入学农民达二五二、三○○名。一般冬学学员均学了一百个字以上，最好的学了五、六百字；同时进行了政治学习，学员们都知道了国旗国歌的意义，认识了谁是中国人民的朋友，谁是中国人民的敌人。在张家口、大同等城市中，工人教育与干部业余教育亦已初步举办。如张市自去年八月起，已有八百多名在职干部开始业余文化学习。
    主要缺点  部分干部轻视教育工作，忽视业务学习。
    为总结一年来工作，察哈尔省人民政府文教厅于三月二十日召开了各专署教育科长与市教育局长会议。会上检讨了教育工作中尚存在的几个缺点：其一，教育工作的领导尚待加强。部分地区领导干部对教育工作重视不够，全省尚有四个县未配备教育科长，有的县（如康保）看到教育科员文化程度较高，就要调他去作其他工作。有的小学教员被调走了，而教育部门尚不知道，影响了教育工作。同时，领导上的预见性、计划性不够，去年学校教育的发展，存在着某种程度的盲目性；对灾区教育如何坚持，不能坚持的又如何保存力量准备恢复，在中央未指示前，没有明确计划。布置冬学时，曾计划结合小学进行，而未预计到小学教员在放寒假后要受训。领导工作未掌握中心环节，未能做到吸取典型经验来指导工作。如有的县抓紧县视导员与中心学校校长的领导，对推动教育工作发挥作用很大，但这些经验未能推广实行。其二，依靠群众联系群众办学做得不够。有的学校发动群众建校，曾获得很大成绩。但还有不少地区，教员脱离群众，困难无法解决。在教学上，也有不少教员未能听取儿童家长意见，并联系实际来进行教学。其三，教育行政干部与教员忽视业务学习。干部忙于事务工作，对教员的业务领导差。仅注意教员是否“守职”，入学儿童有多少；而对教员是否完成了教学计划，教学方法与教学效果如何，一般都被忽视。甚至有的教育行政干部因自己缺乏业务知识而失掉视导学校的勇气。大部分教员的文化水平很低，而过去只强调了教员的政治学习。
    今年计划  巩固提高已有学校逐步开展工农教育
    对这些缺点，会上大家认为必须在今后努力克服。会议又根据当前情况制订了本年教育工作计划，对小学教育决定以提高巩固为主。使用经费应量入为出，精打细算，发挥有限财力的最大作用。并在自愿原则下提倡群众与学校师生动手建校。并强调学校与群众的联系，教育与实际的联系，各小学应召开定期的家长会议，有计划地进行家庭访问等，征求群众意见，共同办好学校。在社会教育方面，本年起有步骤有计划地结合生产开始扫除文盲工作，首先精密调查文盲，注意吸收失学儿童入学，争取在三、四年内使二十五岁以下青年均识到一千字。同时加强在职干部教育与工人教育；上半年试办工农学校一处，并普遍开展干部业余学校与工人业余学校。
