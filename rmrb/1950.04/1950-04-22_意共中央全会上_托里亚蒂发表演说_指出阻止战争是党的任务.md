Xinhua News Agency, Rome, April 17th: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a speech on the 14th at the Italian Communist Party Central Committee Plenary Session, during the discussion of Scoccimarro's report on the struggle for peace, work, and freedom. In his speech, Togliatti outlined the basic international and domestic situation in Italy. He pointed out: An important characteristic of the current world situation is the widespread and increasing chaos and unease in the economy and politics of the so-called Western world. The reason for this chaos is that today, in the so-called world of Western civilization, all the objective conditions for the demise of the capitalist system have matured, and the profound socialist consciousness of the majority of the working class has also matured. Only the interference of external forces has temporarily hindered the realization of this transformation.

Togliatti then pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the Party has made tremendous progress, and the total number of Party members has reached 2.5 million. Among the working masses, there is a strong and growing indignation towards the current situation and the prospects of war and fascism. A spirit of struggle is widely spreading among the broad masses of workers, even in places where this spirit did not exist two or three years ago. The Socialist Party has also developed into a huge mass party with six to seven hundred thousand members. The vanguard of the working people is followed and understood by the broad masses. The broad masses are prepared to wage the most serious struggles to change the current situation in the country. As long as the leadership is correct, it will be possible to prevent the realization of the reactionary plans of the ruling class. Moreover, together with the peace forces of the world, they will constitute a serious obstacle on the road to war. The task of the Party is to lead this force, to prevent the reactionary plans of the most aggressive capitalists from being put into practice, and to prevent war. This requires political, organizational, propaganda, and mobilization work among the masses, and concrete leadership of the mass movement. Togliatti said: The prospects for Italian social and political life are: struggle, strikes, land occupation, increasingly broad working-class and peasant movements, a surge of highly combative spirit, and a peace movement. To this end, the advanced masses of the working people must be able, under the leadership of their party and trade unions, to concretize their proposals for new policies before the people of the whole country.

Togliatti finally pointed out two requirements facing the Party: first, a higher degree of initiative and greater fighting spirit; second, to expand the front of struggle, to use the strengthening of the Party's fighting spirit, to use its alliances and the role of its alliances, to change the situation in Italy, and to save freedom and peace.

　　意共中央全会上
    托里亚蒂发表演说
    指出阻止战争是党的任务
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马十七日电，意共总书记托里亚蒂在十四日意共中央全会讨论斯科西马罗关于为争取和平、工作与自由而斗争的报告时，发表演说。托里亚蒂在演说中概述了当前国际及意大利国内的基本情势。他指出：当前世界上的一个重要特点，是所谓西方世界的经济与政策上，普遍存在着有增无已的巨大混乱和不安。这种混乱的原因就是，今天在所谓西方文明世界，资本主义制度灭亡的一切客观必要条件，都已成熟，而且工人阶级大多数的深邃的社会主义觉悟也已成熟了。仅仅是托庇于外来力量的干涉，才暂时阻碍了这一转变的实现。
    托里亚蒂继指出党自今年以来，获得了巨大的发展，党团员的总数已达二百五十万。劳动群众中间对于目前局势及这种局势的战争和法西斯主义的前景，存在着一种强有力的和日益增长的义愤。广大的劳动群众中间广泛地传布着一种战斗的精神，两三年前还没有这种精神的地方，现在也有了。社会党也已发展成为有六七十万党员的巨大的群众政党。劳动人民的先锋队伍为广大的群众所追随、所了解。广大的群众准备进行最严重的斗争，以求改变国内的现势。只要领导正确，就能够阻止统治阶级反动集团的种种计划的实现。并且，与全世界和平力量一起，他们并将构成战争道路上的一个严重障碍。党的任务就是领导这种力量，不让最富侵略性的资本主义分子的反动计划见诸实行，阻止战争。这就需要在群众中进行政治的、组织的、宣传的和鼓动的工作，具体领导群众运动。托里亚蒂说：意大利社会及政治生活的前景就是：斗争，罢工，占地，益趋广大的工人阶级运动和农民运动，充满高度战斗精神的风潮与和平运动。为此，劳动人民的先进群众必须要能在他们的党与工会的领导下，将他们新政策的建议，在全国人民面前具体化。
    托里亚蒂最后指出摆在党面前的两项要求：第一，更高度的主动性和更大的战斗精神；第二，扩大斗争的阵线，运用党的战斗精神的加强，运用它的同盟和它同盟的作用，以改变意大利的局势，拯救自由及和平。
