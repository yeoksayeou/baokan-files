    Rear Echelon Troops Must Pay Postage According to Regulations
    Postal General Administration Answers Readers' Questions
    We have recently received inquiries about the regulations for mailing military mail. Some readers pointed out that some personnel in rear echelon military organizations are still using military mail casually. We have specifically asked the Business Department of the Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to answer this question as follows:
    "According to the 'Regulations on Military Postal Organization and Work' promulgated by the former North China People's Government and the Political Department of the North China Military Region: 'All mail handed over to the military post office by the front-line field army will be posted free of charge; in addition, all mail handed over to local post offices by any organization or individual must be paid for according to regulations.' This is because the front-line field army is highly mobile and far from local post offices, making it difficult to mail letters. Therefore, military post offices are set up to handle simple business such as receiving and sending ordinary letters and important official documents, in order to facilitate communication between front-line soldiers and contact between upper and lower levels and the front and rear. The main purpose is to meet the needs of the war and complete the task of supporting the front.
    As for rear echelon troops or military organizations, the situation is quite different. Not only is the environment stable, but there are local post offices everywhere that can solve the problem of mailing letters. Moreover, local post offices are state-owned enterprises. If postage is reduced, income will decrease, and income and expenditure will not be balanced, which will inevitably be subsidized by the government. In order to reduce government subsidies and the people's burden, it is stipulated that no matter who submits mail to the local post office, they must pay postage according to regulations."

    后方部队寄信必须照章纳费
    邮政总局答读者问
    我们最近接到一些询问关于投寄军邮信件规定的来信，他们指出某些后方军事机关人员还有随便使用军邮的情况，我们特请邮电部邮政总局业务处对此问题解答如下：
    “按前华北人民政府与华北军区政治部所颁布之‘军邮组织及工作细则’规定：‘凡前方野战军交给军邮局的邮件免费收寄；此外不论任何机关或个人交给地方邮局之邮件，一律照章纳费。’这因为前方野战军流动性大，距离地方邮局过远，寄信困难；故设立军邮局办理收寄平信及重要公文等简单业务，以便利前方战士通讯及上下前后方之联系。主要目的系为了适应战争需要，完成支前任务。
    至于后方部队或军事机构情况则截然不同，不但环境稳定，而且到处都有地方邮局，可以解决寄信问题。且地方邮局是国营企业，如减费收寄邮件，收入减少，收支不能平衡，势必由政府补贴。为了减少政府补贴与人民负担，故规定无论何人向地方邮局交寄邮件，必须按章纳费。”
