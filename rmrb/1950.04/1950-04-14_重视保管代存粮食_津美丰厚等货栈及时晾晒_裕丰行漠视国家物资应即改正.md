　　Emphasize Safekeeping of Stored Grain
    Jinmei Fenghou and Other Warehouses Promptly Sun-Dry Grain
    Yufeng Firm Disregards State Property and Should Correct This Immediately

　　To ensure that the people's supplies are not damaged by dampness and mold, the Tianjin Meifeng Hou, Jiaotong, Jinmao, and other warehouses are actively sun-drying grain stored on behalf of others. The Meifeng Hou warehouse stores a large amount of grain on behalf of the North China Grain Company and serves as the group leader for those storing grain on behalf of others. This warehouse not only cherishes the grain stored on behalf of others, designating special personnel to sun-dry it, ensuring that the existing more than 100,000 jin of corn will be completely dried within three days; but also motivates and supervises other households to carry out sun-drying. Jiaotong Warehouse and Jinmao, among others, have also mobilized dozens of people to organize large-scale sun-drying, reducing the moisture content of the grain to prevent dampness and mold, demonstrating a responsible attitude towards the grain stored on behalf of others. However, there are also individual depositors who repeatedly delay, causing the grain to develop a foul odor. For example, Tianjin Yufeng Firm, solely concerned with private profit, has never sun-dried the grain stored on behalf of others. Despite four urgings and inspections by the North China Grain Company, it remained indifferent, citing concerns about losing money. As a result, during the company's fifth inspection on March 29th, it was discovered that 70,000 jin of corn had developed a foul odor. After the Grain Company promptly informed them to immediately sun-dry the grain to avoid greater losses, the firm began sun-drying work. This kind of depositor who is indifferent to the people's property should urgently correct their mistakes.

### 重视保管代存粮食  津美丰厚等货栈及时晾晒  裕丰行漠视国家物资应即改正

　　重视保管代存粮食
    津美丰厚等货栈及时晾晒
    裕丰行漠视国家物资应即改正
    天津美丰厚、交通、锦茂等货栈为保证人民物资不致潮湿霉坏，积极翻晒代存粮食。美丰厚货栈代华北粮食公司代存粮食很多，并为代存户小组长，该栈不但对代存粮食颇为爱护，设有专人晾晒，保证三日内将现存玉米十余万斤扫数晒干；且能带动与督促其他各户进行晾晒。交通货栈与锦茂等家也都动员了数十人组织大翻晒，使粮食水分降低不致潮湿霉坏，表现了对代存粮食的负责态度。但也有个别存户，一再拖延，致使粮食发生臭味。如：天津裕丰行即专为私人营利着想，对代存粮食始终不晒，虽经华北粮食公司四次督促检查，仍置若罔闻；理由是怕赔钱，致在三月二十九日该公司第五次检查时即发现有玉米七万斤发生臭味。经粮食公司及时告知马上晾晒，避免更大损失，该号始开始翻晒工作。此种对人民资财漠不关心的代存户，亟应改正错误。
