　　Malayan National Liberation Army Intercepts British Military Vehicles and Trains
    British Government Accepts Urgent Request for Troop Increase
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 11th] The Malayan National Liberation Army has launched victorious attacks in recent days. According to reports from American, British, and French news agencies: From April 4th to 8th, the Malayan National Liberation Army continuously attacked British military police in areas such as Kota Tinggi in Johor, Anson in Perak, and Kedah, ambushing British military vehicles and killing British administrator Kidlo near Pulau in Pahang. During this period, the Liberation Army also continuously intercepted trains on the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur railway, a major transportation line in Malaya, causing trains to derail twice in five days.
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 11th] According to a TASS dispatch from London on the 10th, citing the *Daily Mail*, the British government will soon accept the urgent request for troop increases in Malaya. These requests include at least the immediate deployment of a British "special division" and a significant increase in the number of aircraft of the "Royal" Air Force. In addition to these requests, Gurkha troops are being sent from Hong Kong to reinforce Malaya.
    Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Sydney on the 7th, Britain is preparing to use Australian troops to reinforce the colonial war in Malaya. British Lord Maudling recently stated in an article published in the London *Daily Mail*: "More people skilled in jungle warfare would benefit the situation in Malaya, and I believe these people can be obtained from Australia. There are no better people." When the Malayan People's Army began its offensive this January, Harding, the British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, clamored for the Empire to send troops to Malaya. The Menzies government of Australia's promise to implement conscription supported this proposal, and a complete plan was formulated at the recent Colombo Conference. The Australian government recently declared in Canberra that the proposal to use Australian troops in Malaya "is under consideration." The current problem is that the Australian people do not accept this proposal, which is the main stumbling block for the reactionaries.

　　马来亚民族解放军截击英军汽车火车
    英国政府已接受增兵紧急要求
    【新华社十一日讯】马来亚民族解放军连日胜利出击。综合美英法各通讯社消息：本月四日至八日，马来亚民族解放军在柔佛州哥达丁宜、霹雳州安顺及吉打州等地区，不断出击英国军警，伏击英军汽车，并在彭亨布劳附近击毙英国行政官基德洛。在此期间，解放军并连续截击了马来亚主要交通线新加坡至吉隆坡铁路上的火车，使该线火车在五天中出轨两次。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十日电引《每日邮报》报道：英国政府将于最近接受增兵马来亚的紧急要求。这些要求包括：至少立即派遣一个英国“特种师”并大量增加“皇家”空军的飞机。在这些要求之外，增援马来亚的还有正自香港开赴马来亚的廓尔喀部队。
    又据电通社悉尼七日消息：英国正准备利用澳大利亚的军队，以增援马来亚的殖民战争。英国上议员茂杜克最近在伦敦每日邮报上发表的文章内说：“更多熟练丛林战的人，对马来亚的形势会有益处，我认为这些人可以从澳大利亚方面得到。再没有更好的人了”。而当今年一月马来亚人民军队开始进攻时，英国驻远东军总司令哈丁，就曾呐喊着要帝国出兵马来亚。澳大利亚孟席斯政府所允诺的实施征兵，支持了这一建议，而在最近的科伦坡会议中，更拟定了完整的计划。澳大利亚政府最近又在堪培拉宣称：使用澳大利亚军队在马来亚作战的建议“正在考虑中”。目前的问题在于澳大利亚人民不接受此项建议，这是反动派的主要的绊脚石。
