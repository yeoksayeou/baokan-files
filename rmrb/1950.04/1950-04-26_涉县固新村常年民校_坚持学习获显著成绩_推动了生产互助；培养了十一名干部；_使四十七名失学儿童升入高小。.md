　　She County Gu Xin Village Year-Round People's School
    Persistent Study Achieves Remarkable Results
    Promoting Production Mutual Aid; Cultivating Eleven Cadres; Enabling Forty-Seven Out-of-School Children to Enter Higher Primary School.
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Yang Yu-feng reports: Since 1946, Gu Xin Village in She County, Hebei Province, has established a year-round people's school. Over the past four years, it has gradually developed, and now 340 young men and women and out-of-school children are participating in learning. The year-round people's school in this village has not only improved the cultural and political level of the students, but also promoted production mutual aid work; at the same time, it has cultivated eleven cadres (including eight women and three men, six of whom are working in the county, three are district cadres, and two are working in the village), and enabled forty-seven out-of-school children (mostly children of poor peasants) to enter higher primary schools.
  Four Children Founded a People's School, Developing to Three Hundred Enrolled
    The people's school in Gu Xin Village was initially started by children. The village is an old liberated area, and there had been winter schools more than ten years ago. In the spring of 1946, female students Chen Mai-guo, Liu Tao-xian, and others organized thirty-two out-of-school girls to form four small "noon schools," using the lunch break to study. The spring's learning achievements were quite significant. After summarizing and selecting learning models, it influenced other children. First, Cui Yu-ting and Rong Yun-ting each organized a study group to challenge the girls and compete in learning. In one summer, it developed into eleven groups, with eighty-eight out-of-school children participating in learning. Parents saw that their children not only did not go outside the village to play mischievously during the noon break, but also could report their learning achievements to their parents. They were all very happy and supported them. Subsequently, some of the youth in the village also came to the noon school to study with the children. After the autumn harvest, farmers were accustomed to not resting at noon. Village Committee Member Rong Sheng convened a meeting and turned the "noon school" into a "night school," and formally renamed it the People's School. More young people enrolled. Now, a total of twenty-five study groups have been established (called "small people's schools" in the village, including fifteen male groups and ten female groups), with 161 young men and women and 179 out-of-school children participating in learning, totaling 340, of whom 250 regularly persist in learning.
  Small People's School is a Mutual Aid Team, Learning and Production Closely Integrated
    Initially, young people had difficulties enrolling. They were very busy with work, and had to engage in sideline occupations during the slack farming season. Although some people had a very urgent need for culture, they all felt that there was a "contradiction" between production and learning, and some even complained that "the superiors are asking us to engage in sideline occupations and also asking us to learn." The village literacy committee went deep into persuasion and education, first solving the ideological obstacles of the cadres, and then encouraging the learning enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, the story of Shen Yong-xian in the village, who used one thousand yuan as two hundred yuan because he was illiterate, was used to educate everyone. The organization of learning was combined with production, which made the people's school learning proceed smoothly.
    The village's learning organization is based on the voluntary participation of the masses, forming "small people's schools" (each group has about ten people). The "small people's school" is also a mutual aid team at the same time, and the mutual aid team leader also serves as a little teacher. Facts have proved that organizing learning has a great effect on consolidating mutual aid organizations and promoting production. For example, Qin Guo-zhen's mutual aid team had eight women. Initially, it only had a formality, and only four people actually participated in production. Since organizing learning, they have been learning, spinning cotton, and working in the fields together, without missing one person. They use their rest time during production to learn, such as learning the character "flower" when spinning cotton; learning the two characters "radish" when pulling radishes in the field; in order to facilitate filling out forms, they compiled the forty surnames of the entire village into a song and learned it in the mutual aid team. Another example is the Wen Shui-hao mutual aid team, which brought textbooks to the fields, and lectured and reviewed during breaks; the Rong Fa-xian group moved the blackboard to the mat weaving mutual aid field, teaching literacy while explaining mat weaving techniques. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm for learning is very high. The village literacy committee compiled these typical facts on the blackboard newspaper to commend them, promoting production and learning in the entire village. After learning, two women's mutual aid teams even went out to dig the ground at night.
  Elect Teachers from the Masses, Teaching in Combination with Reality
    The teachers of the people's school are all volunteer teachers elected from the masses, with a total of twenty-five cultural teachers and ten political teachers. They can teach with preparation and planning. Everyone holds regular meetings to exchange experiences and determine the teaching plan for the next stage. They can patiently find ways to help students remember, and can also use all possible gaps to teach. At the same time, they also take care of the students' fatigue from participating in labor. When teaching, they pay attention to connecting with reality, giving simple examples, and mobilizing students to discuss. For example, when Rong Zhong-cheng taught the "Spring Plowing" lesson in the people's school, he mobilized the students to discuss. Some students said that deep plowing is good, and some said that fine plowing is good; some said, "I used to plow the land carelessly, anyway, it depends on the board being good." After everyone argued, they criticized the incorrect opinions and resolved to plow deeply and carefully in the coming spring. After some groups taught the lesson "Manure is the Essence of the Land," the students all picked up manure. For example, Ma Xue-cai picked up thirty loads of manure in twenty days. In the political class, the current production policies and burden policies are explained in combination, and new patriotic education is carried out to improve the students' political understanding. When the village handed in public grain, everyone picked good rice to hand in.
  Cadres Attach Importance to People's School Leadership, Checking and Supervising to Solve Problems
    The village cadres attach great importance to the work of the people's school. The literacy committee regularly checks and supervises the teaching and learning of each group, and helps solve difficulties. It also organizes teachers to summarize experiences, promptly commends models, and introduces good teaching methods. In addition, it also organizes students to engage in sideline occupations to solve the funding of the people's school. The village people's school's annual expenses for lamp oil, books, stationery, etc., are mostly prepared in the first three months, so that there will be no difficulties in the middle, ensuring the regular progress of learning.

　　涉县固新村常年民校
    坚持学习获显著成绩
    推动了生产互助；培养了十一名干部；使四十七名失学儿童升入高小。
    【本报讯】通讯员杨玉峰报道：河北省涉县固新村自一九四六年起建立常年民校，四年来逐步发展，现在已有三百四十名男女青年和失学儿童参加学习。该村常年民校不独提高了学员的文化程度和政治水平，更推动了生产互助工作；同时，培养了十一名干部（内女八名，男三名。六人参加县工作，三名任区干部，两名在本村工作），并使四十七名失学儿童（大部是贫苦农民子女）升入了高级小学。
  四个儿童创办民校  发展到三百人入学
    固新村的民校，最初是由儿童们搞起来的。该村是老解放区，十多年前就有了冬学。一九四六年春天，女生陈麦果、刘桃仙等四人，组织了三十二名失学女儿童，成立四个小“午校”，利用中午休息时间学习。一春的学习成绩挺大，经过总结和评选学习模范，影响了其他儿童。首先有崔雨亭、戎云庭二人各组织一个学习小组，和女生挑战竞赛学习。一个夏天，发展到十一个组，八十八名失学儿童参加了学习。家长们看到自己孩子不但午息时不到村外去顽耍淘气了，而且能把学习成绩向家长交代，都非常高兴，给他们以支持。接着，村上的一部分青年也到午校和儿童们一块学习起来。秋收以后，农民习惯中午不休息了。村民教委员戎胜就召集大家开会，把“午校”转向“夜校”。并正式改称民校，青年们入学的更多了。到现在，共成立了二十五个学习组（村里称为“小民校”，内男十五组，女十组），参加学习的有男女青年一百六十一名，失学儿童一百七十九名，共计三百四十名，其中有二百五十名经常坚持学习。
  小民校就是互助组  学习生产密切结合
    最初，青年们入学曾有困难。他们干活很忙，农闲时又要搞副业。虽然一部分人要求文化很迫切，但都感到生产与学习“有矛盾”，有的还埋怨“上级又叫搞副业，又叫学习。”村识字委员会就深入说服教育，首先解决干部的思想障碍，再鼓励群众的学习情绪。同时，把本村申永仙因不识字拿一千元当两百元用了的故事教育大家。又将生产与学习的组织结合起来，才使民校学习顺利进行。
    该村的学习组织，是根据群众自愿，分别组成“小民校”（每组人数在十人左右）。“小民校”同时就是互助组，互助组长兼小先生。事实证明，组织学习对巩固互助组织，推进生产有很大作用。如秦果贞互助组有八名妇女，起初光有个形式，实际参加生产的只有四人。自组织学习之后，她们一块学习，一块纺花，一块上地，不短一个了。她们在生产中利用休息时间学习，如纺花时就学“花”字；上地拔萝卜就学“萝卜”两个字；为了填表方便，就把全村四十个姓编成歌，在互助组里学会。又如温水号互助组带着课本下地，休息时就讲课温课；戎发先组把黑板搬到编席互助场里，一面教识字，一面讲编席的技术。这样，大家学习的劲头都很高。村识字委员会把这些典型事实编在黑板报上表扬，推动了全村的生产和学习。有两个妇女互助组在学习之后，竟至黑夜出去刨地。
  从群众中推选教员  结合实际进行教学
    民校教师都是群众中推选的义务教师，共有文化教员二十五人，政治教员十人。他们能做到有准备、有计划地教学。大家定期开会交流经验，确定下一阶段的教学计划。他们能耐心地想办法帮助学员记忆，又能利用各种可能的空隙时间进行教学。同时，也照顾学员参加劳动的疲劳。教学时，他们注意联系实际，举出浅近的例子，并发动学员大家讨论。如戎中成在民校教“春耕”一课时，就发动学员讨论。有的学员说耕得深好，有的说耕得细好；有人则说“我过去耕地是胡闹的，反正凭地板好”，大家争论之后，批判了不正确的意见，并决心来春要深耕细作。有的组讲过“粪是地里精”一课后，学员们都拾起粪来，如马学才在二十天里就拾了三十担粪。在政治课中，结合讲当前的生产政策、负担政策并进行新的爱国主义教育等，提高了学员的政治认识。该村交公粮时，大家都拣好的米交上去。
  干部重视民校领导  检查督促解决问题
    该村干部对民校工作很重视，识字委员会经常检查、督促各组的教学和学习，帮助解决困难。并组织教员总结经验，及时表扬模范，介绍好的教学方法。此外，并组织学员搞副业来解决民校的经费。该村民校每年的灯油、书籍、文具等用费，大部分都在前三个月就准备好了，不致中途发生困难，保证了学习的经常进行。
