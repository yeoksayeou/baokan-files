　　Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Mechanical Station Employees Continuously Innovate Tools to Facilitate Work

    [Our Newspaper] The employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's Mechanical Station have continuously created new tools, which have greatly benefited the improvement of work efficiency. The work of the Mechanical Station is to maintain long-distance telephone carrier machines and wire telegraphs. In the past, when testing line impedance, Japanese instruments were used, and extremely complicated mathematical formulas had to be used to obtain the results. After the station organized technical study classes, the workers enthusiastically studied and strived to improve their skills. After concentrated research by workers Zhang Honglun and Guo Manyi, a new impedance device was created, which saved more than half the working time compared to the Japanese impedance device. The new impedance device was named the 13-G Impedance Device because the work positions of workers Zhang and Guo were Group 13 and Group G. Lu Jizeng, the head of the station, also used his brains to calculate impedance, and he created an impedance calculation chart, which, when used with the 13-G impedance device, further increased convenience. In addition, Zheng Rongjiang, the measurement chief of the station, and others also created a line fault location finder, which is of great convenience for surveying and mapping faults such as broken wires, twisted wires, and grounding, avoiding the trouble of searching back and forth in a section in the past.

　　京电信局机务站职工连创新工具便利工作
    【本报讯】北京电信局机务站职工连续创造新工具，对提高工作效率补益甚大。机务站的工作是维护有线长途电话载波机及有线电报。过去，测试线路阻抗时是使用日式仪器，必须用极繁杂的数学公式始能求得。该站组织技术学习班后，工友热心学习并力求改进技术。经工友张鸿伦、郭曼一专心钻研后，创造了一新式阻抗器，较日式阻抗器可省工时一半以上。新式阻抗器因张、郭二工友工作岗位为十三号与Ｇ组而命名为１３—Ｇ阻抗器。该站站长鲁继曾也曾为计算阻抗而运用脑筋，他创造了一种阻抗计算图表，配合１３—Ｇ阻抗器使用，更增加了便利。此外，该站测量长郑荣江等并创造了线路障碍地点寻找器，对勘测断线、绞线、接地等障碍有极大方便，避免了过去在一段内来回寻找的麻烦。
