　　Preventing Rinderpest and Anthrax

　　Note: The vaccination of livestock in the suburbs of Beijing has recently concluded. If there are any livestock that have not been vaccinated and still need to be, please contact the Suburban Livestock Disease Prevention Team of the Suburban Committee at telephone number 4-1810.

　　Rinderpest

　　Rinderpest is when large groups of cattle suddenly fall ill at the same time. The sick cattle first develop a fever, cough, and lose their appetite or refuse to eat at all. Afterward, a pus-like substance flows from their eyes and noses, their eyes become red and swollen, and ulcers develop in the mucous membranes of their mouths. Initially, they stop defecating, and then they develop severe diarrhea. After three or four days, they become unable to stand. Due to not being able to eat and suffering from severe diarrhea, the sick cattle become unwell and make pitiful moaning sounds. Later, their whole bodies tremble. In severe cases, they die within ten days or so.

　　If cattle show these symptoms, it should be reported to the village government immediately. On the one hand, the sick cattle should be separated from the healthy cattle to prevent contact between them; otherwise, the entire herd will be wiped out.

　　The only good way to prevent rinderpest is to vaccinate the cattle before they get sick. Vaccinated cattle will be immune to rinderpest for up to a year.

　　Anthrax

　　As the saying goes, there are seventy-two kinds of “yellow disease”; anthrax is the most serious of them. Because the spleen of livestock that die from anthrax is particularly swollen, it is also called "swollen spleen yellow."

　　This disease is mainly an acute infectious disease of horses and cattle. The occurrence of the disease is related to the region. The near suburbs of Beijing are where anthrax outbreaks are relatively common. Why is this disease related to the region? Because anthrax is caused by a very small, highly virulent bacterium. This bacterium is abundant in the blood of sick livestock. When the livestock die, we in the countryside usually skin them and eat their meat. The bacteria then flow with the blood of the dead livestock onto the ground, where they can survive for years. If livestock eat grass and water contaminated with this blood, they will develop anthrax.

　　Livestock with anthrax can die within one or two hours at the fastest. When they die, dark reddish blood flows from their mouths, ears, nostrils, anus, and vulva. The external symptoms of livestock with this disease include: poor spirits, reluctance to move, bloodshot eyes, loss of appetite, and no bowel movements. They may also have severe bloating. Because the livestock have stomach pain, they roll around incessantly and often have lumps of swelling on their chests, legs, and under their bellies. Therefore, as soon as livestock show symptoms, a veterinarian should be sought immediately. If the condition is mild, it can still be treated at this time; a slight delay will be too late.

　　If there are livestock that die suddenly like this, everyone must not skin them and eat their meat. Instead, they must find an experienced veterinarian to inspect them and follow the veterinarian's instructions. This is not only a livestock disease; if people eat the meat of dead livestock or accidentally cut their hands while skinning dead livestock, they will suffer from the same disease and die. The best way to prevent anthrax is to give livestock a preventative vaccination before they get sick. This will guarantee that they will not suffer from yellow disease for a year.

### 预防牛瘟、炭疽

　　预防牛瘟、炭疽
    按：北京郊区家畜防疫注射已于日前结束，如有家畜未经注射而仍欲接种者，可要电话四局一八一○号郊委会郊区家畜防治队接洽。
    牛瘟
    牛瘟，就是大群大群的牛一下子同时发病。得病的牛，先是发烧、咳嗽、不爱吃东西、或者根本不吃东西，以后眼睛里和鼻子里流出一种脓一样的东西，眼睛红肿口腔里的粘膜发生烂斑。它先是不拉粪，以后大拉稀，三、四天后，就爬不起来了。病牛因为吃不下东西和大拉稀的缘故，精神不好，同时发生很可怜的哼声，后来全身发抖，厉害的十来天就死了。
    如果牛发生了这样症候，便应该赶紧到村政府里去报告；一方面把病牛和好牛分开来，不要使病牛和好牛接触，否则，同群的牛就都完了。
    预防牛瘟惟一的好办法，就是在牛还没病的时候，打预防针。打了针的牛，就可以在一年以内不生牛瘟了。
    炭疽
    俗话说，黄病有七十二种；炭疽病就是黄病里最厉害的一种。因为炭疽病死的牲口的镰铁（脾脏）特别肿大，故它又叫做“镰铁黄”。
    这个病主要是马和牛的急性传染病。病的发生和地区有关系，北京近郊就是比较常闹炭疽病的地方。为什么这个病和地区有关系呢？因为炭疽病是一种体积很小、毒力很大的细菌所引起的；这细菌在病牲口的血里很多，牲口死了，咱们乡下都是要剥皮吃肉的，这细菌便随着死牲口的血流到地上几年不死。如果牲口吃了这种被这血染过的草料和水后，就会发生炭疽病。
    得了炭疽病的牲口，最快的一两个钟头内就会死亡，死的时候，由嘴、耳孔、鼻孔、肛门、阴门等处流出暗赤色的血液。牲口得了这个病，外表上可以看出：精神不好，不爱行动，眼睛通红，不吃不拉，也有肚子膨胀得很厉害。因为牲口肚子痛，便不停地打滚，并在胸前腿上及肚子下常有一块块的肿起来的癀。因此，在牲口刚一发病，便应该立刻去找兽医，病势轻的，在这时候还可以治，稍一耽误就来不及了。
    如果有这样暴死的牲口，大家千万不要动手剥皮吃肉，而一定要找有经验的兽医来检验，听兽医的话来办理。因为这不仅是牲口的病，如果人吃了死牲口的肉，或者剥死牲口的皮时不小心划破了手，都会害同样的病而死亡。防止“炭疽”最好的办法，是在牲口还没有病以前，打一次预防针。这样，就可以保证它在一年以内不生黄病了。
