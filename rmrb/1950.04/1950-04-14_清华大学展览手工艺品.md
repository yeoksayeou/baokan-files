　　Tsinghua University Exhibits Handicrafts
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Tsinghua University Relics Museum Preparatory Committee, the Department of Sociology, and the Department of Architecture held a handicraft exhibition on the 8th and 9th, displaying more than 300 pieces of lacquer inlay crafts, carved lacquer crafts, metal crafts, weaving and embroidery crafts, knitting crafts, and fan categories. The purpose of the exhibition is to help the audience understand the achievements of past craftsmen and find directions for the future development of special handicrafts. Prior to this, several professors from Tsinghua and Peking University had paid attention to studying the active improvement of Beijing's special handicrafts and established the Beijing Special Handicraft Research Association. Teachers from the Tsinghua Department of Architecture have also carefully designed some new patterns. The first new pattern is the fish basket jar, collectively created by Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin, Mo Zongjiang, and others. Great success has been achieved in terms of shape, pattern, and color. These newly designed works received high praise from the audience at this exhibition.

　　清华大学展览手工艺品
    【本报讯】清华大学文物馆筹备会、社会系、营建系于八、九两日举办了手工艺展览，展出漆嵌工艺、雕漆工艺、金属工艺、织绣工艺、编制工艺、扇类等作品三百余件。展览的目的，意在帮助观众了解过去匠师们手下的成就，寻找今后发展特种手工艺的方向。在此以前，清华、北大的几位教授曾注意研究北京特种手工业的积极改进问题，成立了北京特种手工艺研究会。清华营建系教师更精审地设计了一些新式图样。第一件新图样是梁思成、林徽音、莫宗江等集体创作的鱼篓罐。在形体、花纹、色泽等方面都获得很大的成功。这些新设计的作品，在此次展览中获得观众很高的评价。
