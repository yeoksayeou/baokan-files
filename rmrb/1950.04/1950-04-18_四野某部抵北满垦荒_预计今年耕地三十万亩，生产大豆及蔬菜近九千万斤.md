Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th—A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army, transferred from the Central South region to the Northeast for production, has launched a large-scale agricultural production movement on the vast plains of Northern Manchuria. The production plan of this unit stipulates that the cultivated area this year will reach 300,000 mu, and the total annual production is estimated to be 57,600,057.55 jin of soybeans and over 30 million jin of vegetables.

	This unit participated in the production movement in Nanniwan, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, during the Anti-Japanese War and has rich experience in agricultural production. Before departure, the unit conducted thorough mobilization and education. After arriving in the Northern Manchuria reclamation area, they immediately started preparations based on the results of surveys and studies by advance personnel. With the assistance of the Jiamusi Agricultural Experiment Station, various units hired agricultural technicians to run short-term agricultural training classes and held symposiums with labor heroes and veteran farmers to understand the farming methods in the Northeast. They also printed pamphlets on farming experience for specific education. All the plows, 1,500 in total, and various auxiliary farm tools such as sickles, hoes, picks, and two-pronged cultivators required by the entire army have been purchased or ordered by the advance personnel. The directly subordinate organs of the unit purchased five tractors and organized a farm, which is expected to cultivate 500 hectares (i.e., 5,000 mu).

	Because the Northeast is vast and sparsely populated, the unit has to go deep into the desolate and boundless reclamation area for land reclamation, which is more than a hundred li away from the garrison. The commanders and fighters, in the freezing weather, rushed to the deep mountains to cut wood and grass to build nearly 500 shacks, dug more than 40 new wells, and prepared the grain, firewood, and horse feed needed for the reclamation and sowing period to ensure that supplies would not be a problem during the thawing of snow and muddy roads in the spring.

	In addition to investing most of its manpower in agricultural production, the remaining labor force of the unit decided to participate in the transportation and rafting (binding wood into rafts and using river water to transport them out) of timber to help the government complete its logging plan. The guards and communication personnel of various organs are now being reduced as much as possible, and cadres handling daily work are doing the work of two people, drawing all the manpower that can be drawn to invest in production.

	In order to adapt to the large-scale and concentrated nature of production, the unit decided to establish a production committee based on the regiment, divided into: an agricultural committee to manage agriculture and animal husbandry; a sideline committee to manage rafting, transportation, logging, and other businesses; and a production cooperative to manage all investments and sales of production products. No separate institutions are set up at the battalion and company levels. Regarding production funds, the commanders and fighters, understanding the country's financial difficulties, decided to use one-half of the production income (estimated at more than 50 billion Northeast currency) as production funds, without relying on national investment or loans.

	The commanders and fighters have now entered the work sites and started reclamation, timber rafting, and other production work. Everyone has formulated merit plans, and a year-round production competition movement has been launched on the Northern Manchuria Plain.

　　四野某部抵北满垦荒
    预计今年耕地三十万亩，生产大豆及蔬菜近九千万斤
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】由中南地区调来东北从事生产的第四野战军某部已在广阔的北满平原展开了大规模的农业生产运动。该部生产计划规定今年耕地面积达三十万亩，全年生产总量预计为大豆五千七百六十万零五千七百五十五斤，蔬菜三千余万斤。
    这一支部队曾经在抗日战争时期中参加过陕北南泥湾的生产运动，对农业生产有丰富的经验。部队出发前曾进行充分的动员教育。开抵北满垦区后，立即根据先遣人员勘察研究的结果着手进行准备工作。在佳木斯农事试验场的协助下，各部纷纷聘请农业技师开办短期农业训练班，召开劳动英雄和老农座谈会，了解东北农作方法；并将农作经验印发小册子，进行具体教育。全军所需犁杖一千五百付及各项附属农具如镰刀、锄头、镐头、二齿锉等均已由先遣人员购买或订制。该部各直属机关则购买了五部拖拉机，组织农场，预计种地五百垧（即五千亩）。
    由于东北地广人稀，部队要深入荒漠无垠的垦区开荒，距离驻地百余里，食住方面非常困难。指战员们在冰天雪地中，赶赴深山砍伐木料、割草，搭成了近五百座的窝棚，新打出四十多口井，同时还准备了开荒播种时期所需用的粮、柴、马料，保证在春暖雪消、道路泥泞时期供给不发生问题。
    该部除了以大部人力投入农业生产外，剩余劳动力决定参加林木的运输、流送（将木材编成木筏，利用江水流运出来）工作，帮助政府完成采伐计划。各机关警卫、通讯人员现正尽量缩减，处理日常工作的干部一个人要做两个人的事，抽调一切可以抽调的人力来投入生产。
    为了适应生产的大规模和集中的特点，该部在生产组织方面，决定以团为单位成立生产委员会，下分：农业委员会，管理农业及畜牧业；副业委员会，管理流送、运输、伐木等事业；生产合作社，管理全部投资及生产成品的销售。营连不另设机构。关于生产资金，指战员体念国家财政困难，决定以二分之一的生产所得（约计东北币五百亿元以上）作为生产资金，不倚赖国家的投资或贷款。
    指战员们现已进入工作场所，开始垦荒、流放林木等生产工作。各人都拟定了立功计划，一个全年性的生产竞赛运动，已在北满平原展开。
