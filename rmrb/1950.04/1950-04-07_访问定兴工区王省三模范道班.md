Visiting the Wang Sheng-san Model Road Maintenance Team of the Dingxing Work Area
\tBy our reporter Lǚ Guāngmíng

"Promote the new road maintenance method, overcome all difficulties in the process, transform backward elements, unite all the workers in the work area, and lead the Dingxing work area to advance rapidly." These are a few precise and appropriate words of praise written in the merit book presented to Wang Sheng-san, the foreman of the Dingxing Road Maintenance Team, by the Tianjin Railway Bureau's celebration meeting in January of this year. Since its establishment on April 15th last year, this road maintenance team has not had a single accident within its jurisdiction. The reason is that they accepted advanced experience the earliest and their road maintenance performance was excellent. The entire road maintenance team initially had only twelve people, increasing to twenty-two in July. Initially, this section of the line had just been repaired. The roadbed was uneven, with varying degrees of softness and hardness, with large pits on both sides, and the line had a tendency to tilt. Especially on rainy days, mud splashed when trains passed, and the maximum train speed was only twenty kilometers per hour. In order to maintain traffic safety and increase train speed, they began selfless labor. There were no workshops at Dingxing Station, so they set up several open-air straw shacks in a private freight yard. Rain and mosquito bites did not make them yield. They didn't get enough sleep and still got up early and worked late. Working in the strong sunlight, nineteen people drank seven wooden buckets of cold water a day. Last summer and autumn were rainy, and the roadbed became even softer, often collapsing into pits and depressions. They patrolled and rushed to repair dangerous works day and night, ensuring the safety of military transportation, passengers' lives and property.

At this time, the Tianjin Railway Bureau issued a call to universally launch a production-saving and security-merit campaign. The workers of the Dingxing Road Maintenance Team rose up to respond, automatically processing overtime. When workers in neighboring work areas were off work, they were still working hard. After work, each person often sifted thirty meters of ballast on the line. In order to solve the material difficulties, they dug up more than twenty rails and some usable scattered equipment from the ruins of enemy and puppet pillboxes. Due to such arduous efforts, the maintenance plans for the work area in July, August, and September were completed half a month ahead of schedule. The train speed jumped from twenty kilometers to thirty-five kilometers.

The entire team of workers in the Dingxing work area was not satisfied with their achievements, and they continued to work hard to study. In September last year, foreman Wang Sheng-san saw the "Introduction to the New Road Maintenance Method" published in the People's Daily in Beijing. He thought, "The method mentioned above is not bad, maybe we can try it." He read the newspaper to all the workers and held a meeting to discuss how to scientifically divide the work, how to closely connect, and how to establish a responsibility system. On September 13th, they began to explore the implementation of the new road maintenance method. According to Foreman Wang, "The key to the success or failure of implementing the Soviet New Road Maintenance Method lies in whether it can change the old leadership style and open up the workers' thinking." At the beginning of the trial implementation of the new road maintenance method in the Dingxing work area, there were many difficulties in both ideological and work aspects. He used himself as an example: "During the enemy and puppet rule, I learned two skills. One is line technology, and the other is the bureaucratic style of the Kuomintang. If the workers didn't do well, I would lose my temper. I often thought, 'Don't do what's illegal, don't eat what makes you sick, anyway, if I do it, you have to do it.' Later, I realized that this could not solve the workers' ideological problems. After the education from the higher authorities and the criticism from the worker brothers, I made up my mind, 'If you want to transform others, you must first transform yourself.'" For three consecutive nights, meetings were held to discuss problems, and all the workers were mobilized to criticize the leadership style of the foreman. I also made a relatively deep self-criticism, ensuring that I would resolutely promote democracy in the future and never make a scene. After repeated discussions by everyone, it was decided to implement the method of "all work must be discussed by the foreman and workers, and plans and standards must be jointly formulated." Finally, after everyone's discussion, standards were set and written into covenants, which were hung in the middle of the room and read aloud at the beginning of each meeting. In addition, he said that the leadership should also promptly understand the ideological psychology of each worker and influence them in their work by setting an example. Here are two examples: Last autumn, twelve workers were transferred from various work areas north of Gaobeidian. They were ideologically afraid that if they did a good job in the Dingxing work area, they would be transferred further south, farther away from home. When assigning work to each group, some people were afraid that if their group's work was finished, they would have to help other groups. Therefore, they were not active enough. After Foreman Wang's in-depth explanation and the lead of activists, these ideological obstacles were quickly eliminated. The great change in the old work style of all the workers laid a good ideological foundation for the implementation of the new road maintenance method.

At that time, their twenty-odd workers were divided into three work groups: crawling, straightening, and pile driving; track aligning and changing; track raising and tamping. They gradually advanced the work from one end of the work area to the other. Democratic discussion was conducted before construction, and manpower and materials were planned. Unless it was not done, once it was done, it had to meet the standard specifications. When the new road maintenance method was first implemented, the workers were not used to carrying the complete set of tools and found it troublesome. After a few days, everyone felt that there were many benefits: they had everything they needed, and the work was done solidly, saving the repetition of work the next day because the tools were not complete. At that time, individual workers thought, "This is simply making a fool of yourself." But the activists took the lead. At first, they didn't understand the specific methods of the new road maintenance method, and they were so tired that the whole twenty-odd workers could only do eighty meters a day. After a period of time, through research and exploration, the whole team could do 180 meters a day.

What are the benefits of the new road maintenance method? Foreman Wang Sheng-san told reporters, "The advantage of the new road maintenance method is that it can actively carry out work in a planned and step-by-step manner during construction. It is not like the old road maintenance method, which treats the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. The improvement project depends entirely on the foreman's instructions and cannot promote collective wisdom. When carrying out each task in the old road maintenance method, it is mostly a single-handed approach. If the gauge needs to be corrected, the gauge is corrected alone; if the direction is not straight, the direction is straightened; if the level is not flat, the level is raised. Often, a section of the line takes several steps, instead of doing it well in all aspects at once. Therefore, the work often falls into passive repetition, and when something happens, it is grasped here and there, without any clue, not to mention the responsibility system." Indeed, thanks to Foreman Wang's active responsibility, he closely relied on and united all the workers, and by the end of October, they had completed the major overhaul of the eight-kilometer line in the entire work area, increasing the train speed from 35 kilometers to 60 kilometers. (At that time, there were more than 200 short-term workers per day cooperating with them to do non-technical work such as pushing and sifting ballast, and helping to repair the roadbed and dig drainage ditches.)

　　访问定兴工区王省三模范道班
    本报记者  吕光明
    “推行新养路法，在进行过程中，克服一切困难，改造落后分子，团结整个工区工友，领导定兴工区迅速前进。”这是今年一月间，天津铁路局庆功大会赠给定兴道班工长王省三的功臣记事簿上写的几句确切恰当的赞语。这个道班自去年四月十五日成立以来，辖区内从未发生事故。原因是他们接受先进经验最早，养路成绩优良。全道班最初才十二个人，七月间增至二十二个人。最初，这段线路是刚刚抢修成的。路基凹凸不平，软硬不一，两侧有大坑，线路有倾斜现象。特别是雨天，列车经过时泥水四溅，行车时速最高才达到二十公里，为着维护行车安全，提高行车时速，他们开始了忘我的劳动。定兴车站没有工房，他们便在一家私人货场里，搭了几个露天的席窝棚。雨淋、蚊子咬，都没有使他们屈服。他们睡眠不足，还起早摸黑。在强烈的阳光下劳动，十九个人一天喝过七木桶冷水。去年夏秋多雨，路基愈加松软，时常塌凹坑陷，他们不分昼夜的出动巡逻与抢修险工，保障了军运旅客生命财产的安全。
    这时候，天津路局发出普遍开展生产节约、保安立功运动的号召。定兴道班的工友们奋起响应。自动加工加点。邻近工区的工友散工了，他们还在紧张的工作。下班后，每人还常常清筛三十米线路的石碴。为了解决材料困难，他们在敌伪炮楼废墟里，挖出二十多条钢轨及一些可用的零散器材。由于这样的艰苦努力，该工区七、八、九月份的维修计划，提前半月完成。行车时速由二十公里跃升到三十五公里。
    定兴工区的全体工友，并不因获得成绩而满足，他们继续努力钻研。去年九月间，工长王省三看到北京人民日报刊登的《新养路法介绍。》他捉摸着，这上面说的法子倒不错，不妨试试看。他给全体工友读报，并开会讨论如何科学分工，如何密切联系，如何建立负责制。九月十三日，他们开始摸索着实行新养路法。据王工长谈：实行苏联新养路法的成败关键，在于是否能改变旧的领导作风与打通工友的思想。定兴工区在试行新养路法之初，无论在思想方面工作方面，都存在着好多困难。他以自己为例：我在敌伪统治时期，学会了两种本事。一种是线路技术，一种是国民党的官僚主义作风。工友们一个做不好，我便发脾气。我时常想：“犯法的不做，犯病的不吃，反正我干你们就得干。”以后我发觉这样做并不能解决工友们的思想问题。经过上级对我的教育与工友兄弟们的批评，我下定决心，“要想改造别人必先改造自己。”连着三天晚上开会出问题讨论，并发动全体工友对工长的领导作风进行批评。我自己也作了比较深刻的自我检讨。保证今后坚决发扬民主，绝不闹态度。经过大家反复讨论，决定实行“一切工作要经过工长、工友互相讨论，共同订计划、订标准。”的办法。最后经过大家讨论，订出标准，写成公约，悬挂在屋子中间，开会时先朗读一遍。此外，他说领导上更应及时的了解每个工友的思想心理，并在工作中以身作则的去影响他们。这里举出两个例子：去年秋前从高碑店以北各工区调来十二名工友，他们思想上怕把定兴工区的活做好了，再往南调离家更远。各组在分工做活时，有些人怕本组的活做完了，还得帮助别的组做。因此不够积极。经过王工长的深入解释与积极分子带头，把这种种思想障碍很快消除了。全体工友旧作风的大转变，给实行新养路法打下了良好的思想基础。
    当时他们二十多个工友分成爬行整正打桩、拨道改道、起道捣固等三个做工组。从工区的一端，向另一端逐步推进工作。施工前民主讨论，人工材料都计划好。除非不做，一做就得要求基本上合乎标准规格。刚试行新养路法时，带着全套的工具，工友们不习惯，嫌麻烦。过了几天，大家感觉到有许多好处：使什么有什么，作出活来实在。省去因工具不全第二天还得去重复工作。那时，个别工友认为：“这简直是出洋相。”可是积极分子们却带着头干。先干的时候，还不懂新养路法的具体办法，把人累得七死八活，全体二十多个工友，每天才做八十公尺，经过一时期之后，在研究摸索中，全体每天竟可做到一百八十公尺。
    新养路法究竟有什么好处呢？王省三工长告诉记者说：“新养路法的好处是它在施工中，能主动的有计划有步骤的进行工作。它不像旧养路法那样头痛治头、脚痛治脚，改进工程全凭工长吩咐，不能发扬集体智慧。旧养路法在进行每项工作时，多是单打一的做法，需要改正轨距，就单去改正轨距，方向不直再去拨直方向，水平不平再去起好水平。往往一段线路多费好几道手，而不是一下子在各方面都做好。因此工作常陷于被动重复，有了事东抓一把西抓一把，漫无头绪，当然更谈不上负责制。”的确，由于王工长的积极负责，他紧紧的依靠着、团结着全体工友，至十月底，他们完成了全工区八公里线路的大修工程。使行车时速由三十五公里跃升到六十公里。（按当时每天有二百余名短工，配合他们做推、筛石碴，与帮补路基、挖泄水沟等非技术工作。）
