Xinhua News Agency, Fifteenth Dispatch: TASS, Moscow Dispatch: Red Star published a dispatch from Vienna by Zikov on the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Vienna, stating: Throughout the entire post-war five years, the Soviet Union has steadfastly defended the most fundamental interests of the Austrian people. At the same time, American and British imperialism viewed Austria as a bridgehead for their war being prepared against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

The leaders of the ruling "People's" Party and Socialist Party, abandoning the fine-sounding promises they made during the 1945 election campaign, accepted the Marshall Plan, followed the instructions of their American masters, and continuously worsened relations with the People's Democracies, thereby hindering the development of trade with Eastern Europe and harming Austria's vital interests.

The Austrian government not only did not severely punish war criminals and fascist criminals, but instead showed great concern for them.

Following American demands, the Austrian ruling clique devalued the Austrian schilling and imposed new exorbitant taxes on the working people. They placed the Austrian economy under the control of American monopoly capitalists, causing hardship and unemployment for the broad masses of people. In order to divert the people's attention, they slandered the Soviet Union, which had liberated Austria from the shackles of fascism. While the Austrian working people quietly bowed before the graves of the Soviet officers and soldiers who sacrificed themselves to liberate Austria from fascist enslavement, the lackeys of American and British imperialism were sparing no effort to belittle the significance of this historic event that occurred five years ago.

However, the Austrian workers, peasants, and intellectuals will not forget the great liberation achievements of the Soviet Army. The Austrian people have profound and sincere gratitude to the Soviet people who saved them from the evil Hitler regime, and they are closely uniting their ranks in the struggle to consolidate lasting peace, in the struggle led by the great Soviet Union.

　　奥地利的现况
    反动统治集团仰承美帝鼻息
    广大人民遭受着困苦与失业
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报于苏军解放维也纳五周年纪念日刊登兹科夫发自维也纳的通讯称：整个战后的五年中，苏联始终坚定不移地保卫了奥地利人民的最根本利益。与此同时，美英帝国主义却把奥地利看作是他们正在准备的反对苏联与人民民主国家的战事的桥头堡垒。
    当权的“人民”党和社会党领袖们，背弃了他们在一九四五年选举运动时所作的好听诺言，接受了马歇尔计划，奉行了他们美国主子的指示，不断地恶化了与人民民主国家的关系，从而阻挠了和东欧贸易的发展，并使奥地利的切身利益遭受损害。
    奥国政府不但不严惩战争罪犯和法西斯罪犯，反而对他们关切倍至。
    奥国的统治集团遵照美国的要求，降低了奥国先令的比值，把新的苛捐杂税负担，硬加在劳动人民的身上。他们把奥国的经济，置于美国垄断资本家的鼻息之下，害得广大阶层的人民，遭受着困苦和失业。他们为了要转移人民的注意力，就诬蔑从法西斯桎梏下把奥国解放出来的苏联。当奥国的劳动人民，肃静地在为了解救奥国脱离法西斯奴役而牺牲的苏联官兵们的坟墓前鞠躬的日子，美英帝国主义者的奴才们，正不遗余力地贬低五年前发生的这一个历史性事件的意义。
    可是，对于苏军的伟大解放功绩，奥国的工人、农民和知识分子是不会忘记的。奥国人民对于把他们由万恶的希特勒统治下拯救出来的苏联人民，怀着深刻衷诚的感谢，他们在求巩固持久和平的斗争中，在伟大的苏联所领导的斗争中紧密其队伍。
