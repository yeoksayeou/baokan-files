　　法共全国代表大会上洋溢国际主义精神
    毛主席及联共中央贺电引起全场经久热烈欢呼
    【新华社布拉格五日电】三日，法人道报首页以大字标题登载法共十二届全国代表大会开幕消息。在大幅的法共领袖多列士半身像旁边，该报刊登了毛主席致大会的贺电，并称：“在二日上午的会议中，该电由雷蒙·葛约宣读，与会者报以历久不息的欢呼，这显示出法国工人对中国人民的友谊和爱戴的感情。”
    四日该报首页以巨大篇幅登载联共中央致大会的贺电，并称：“大会第二日开始时，主席多列士夫人把扩音机让给乔治·郭尼奥，宣布大会又接到一个贺电。郭尼奥刚读了‘联共中央’几个字，代表们带着不能形容的兴奋情绪，全体起立，高呼‘乌拉’，国际歌歌声四起。一阵阵的热烈掌声之后，郭尼奥才能继续把贺词读完，接着又是历久不息的欢呼。”
