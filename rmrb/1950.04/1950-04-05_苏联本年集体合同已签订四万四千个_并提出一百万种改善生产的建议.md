　　Soviet Union Has Signed 44,000 Collective Contracts This Year
    And Proposed One Million Suggestions for Improving Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 1st dispatch from TASS] The movement for signing the 1950 collective contracts in Soviet enterprises is drawing to a close, with 44,000 contracts already signed in various places. The draft contracts were first discussed at the general meetings of workers and staff, who put forward one million suggestions for further improving production and producing high-quality products. The contracts include workers' resolutions on launching a collective Stakhanovite movement, making the most effective use of equipment, and saving raw materials, etc. The obligations undertaken by the management demonstrate that the living standards of the working people will be further improved in 1950. Thousands of new houses, clinics, hospitals, nurseries, and clubs will be established for workers and staff. Millions of people will master new trades and improve their skills. The management will use huge sums of money to improve working conditions and mechanize the labor-intensive processes.
    Note: The collective contract in Soviet enterprises is concluded by the labor union organization and the enterprise management after collective discussion. Its goal is to fulfill and exceed the enterprise's production plan and to improve the living and cultural conditions of workers and staff. When concluding the contract, both parties' considerations are based on the tasks of the enterprise and the interests of the entire national economy. The collective contract is one of the important methods for organizing workers, technical engineers, and staff to carry out creative labor in the socialist construction of the Soviet Union.

　　苏联本年集体合同已签订四万四千个
    并提出一百万种改善生产的建议
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：苏联各企业订立一九五○年集体合同的运动，行将结束，各处业已签订了四万四千个合同。合同草案首先在工人和职员的大会上进行讨论，他们为进一步改善生产和生产优等产品，已提出了一百万种建议。合同上载有工人关于发动集体斯塔哈诺夫运动、关于最有效地利用装备、关于节省原料等等的决议案。经理部门所承担的义务则表明一九五○年劳动人民的生活水平将获得进一步的改善。数以千计的新的房屋、诊疗所、医院、保育院及俱乐部，将为工人和职员们设立起来。千百万的人民将精通新的行业并改进他们的技术。经理部门动用巨款来改善劳动条件和使劳动消耗过程机械化。
    按：苏联企业中的集体合同是工人组织和企业经理双方经过集体讨论后订定的，它的目标是完成并超过企业的生产计划，和改善工人、职员的生活与文化条件。在订立合同时，双方的考虑都由企业的任务和整个国民经济的利益出发。集体合同是苏联在社会主义建设中组织工人、技术工程人员和职员们进行创造劳动的重要方法之一。
