　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 27th: The Central-South region's grain transfer work is about to be completed. As of the 20th of this month, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have completed the transfer of 300 million catties of rice to Shanghai. In addition to having already overfulfilled its task of transferring 158.8 million catties of wheat to North China, Henan Province has completed more than 90 percent of its task of transferring 120 million catties of miscellaneous grains and rice to Shandong and the Northwest. Only the transfer of 100 million catties of rice and miscellaneous grains to Shanghai has only completed 47 percent of the task due to insufficient transportation. This is currently being sped up. In total, the region has completed 92 percent of its grain transfer task. The intra-regional grain adjustment has completed more than 65 percent of the task and is expected to be completed next month.

　　The Central-South provinces are grain-producing areas and have a surplus of grain for export. However, since more than 80 percent of the region is newly liberated, the masses have not been fully mobilized, and government workers at all levels lack experience in completing such a huge long-distance grain transfer plan. Therefore, in the early stages of the task in January and February of this year, the grain transportation work encountered great difficulties. The manipulation and looting of grain, as well as the incitement to prevent grain from leaving the region, by Kuomintang agents, local bullies, and bandits also increased the difficulty of grain transfer. After repeated instructions from the Central-South Military and Political Committee, various localities universally carried out the rent reduction and refund movement. The People's Government led the peasants to reduce rent and overcome the famine, and smoothly transitioned to production. At the same time, they convened local people's representative meetings to earnestly understand the situation, plan the amount and steps of the people's food needs and grain transfer out of the region, and issued orders to severely punish saboteurs, shattering the sabotage conspiracies of agents, local bullies, and bandits, and winning the support of the broad masses, thereby launching a grain transportation upsurge, enabling the grain transfer plan to be completed quickly. Taking Huangchuan Special District in Henan Province as an example, the number of peasants and transportation workers involved in the grain transportation upsurge reached more than 100,000. In Yunyu Township, Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, the peasants originally had great concerns. After the rent reduction and refund and the convening of peasant representative meetings, the number of grain transporters quickly increased.

　　Most localities have adopted the method of work-for-relief and contracted freight rates to organize the masses to participate in transportation, so that while completing the grain transportation task, they solved the livelihood difficulties of many people during the spring famine. For example, Changde Special District in Hunan Province, which suffered severe floods, solved the life and production problems of more than 88,000 disaster victims in organizing grain transportation. As a result, the masses in various localities are very enthusiastic about transporting grain, and many model deeds of overcoming difficulties and caring for national materials have emerged. More than 2,000 cart workers from Kaifeng City, Henan Province, who went to Huangchuan Special District to transport grain, encountered agents and bandits robbing them on the way from Shangcheng County to Gushi County. Old worker Yan Qilin quickly reported to the local people's county government while organizing the workers to borrow dozens of farm implements from nearby farmsteads to resist, and persisted until the armed forces sent by the county government arrived, saving 200,000 catties of grain from loss. Peasants transporting grain in Liling County, Hunan Province, took off their raincoats to cover the grain when it rained. They said, "It's better for people to get wet than for the grain to get wet."

　　In addition, since the Central-South region convened a financial meeting in mid-March, various provinces have improved grain transfer agencies and established grain transportation headquarters including the main responsible persons of transportation, transportation, and receiving, to unify and strengthen leadership. At the same time, necessary criticisms were also made of the erroneous tendencies such as the departmentalism of some government workers in various localities.

　　Due to the above reasons, the various difficulties in the Central-South region's grain transfer work have been largely overcome in the recent month, and the speed of grain transportation has been greatly improved. For example, Jiangxi Province completed 10 percent of its grain transfer task in January and February, 31 percent in March, and 32 percent in the first half of April. The entire region's grain transfer, from January to the end of March, only completed 48 percent of the total task in three months, and 44 percent of the task was completed in twenty days in April as of the 20th.

　　经过减租退租广大群众踊跃参加运输
    中南调粮工作接近完成
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】中南区粮食调运工作即将全部完成。截至本月二十日为止，湖南、江西两省调运上海大米三亿斤已全部完成。河南省除早已超额完成调华北小麦一亿五千八百万斤的任务之外，调运山东、西北的杂粮、大米一亿二千万斤，已完成百分之九十以上，只有调运上海的大米、杂粮一亿斤，因交通工具不足，仅完成任务百分之四十七，现正加紧赶运中。总计全区外调粮食，已完成总任务的百分之九十二。区内调剂粮则已完成任务百分之六十五以上，预计下月内即可全部完成。
    中南各省为产粮区，向有余粮出境，但因全区百分之八十以上均系新解放区，群众尚未充分发动，各级人民政府工作人员对完成如此巨大的长途调粮计划缺乏经验，因而在今年一、二月间执行任务的初期，运粮工作曾经遭遇极大困难。国民党特务、恶霸地主和土匪的操纵抢粮及煽动阻粮出境，也增加调粮的困难。经过中南军政委员会一再指示，各地普遍开展了减租退租运动，人民政府领导农民减租渡荒，顺利地转入生产；同时，召开各地人民代表会议，切实了解情况，计划各地所需民食与粮食调运出境的数量和步骤，并发布命令严惩破坏分子，粉碎了特务、恶霸地主、土匪破坏阴谋，取得了广大群众的拥护，从而展开运粮热潮，使调粮计划得以迅速完成。仅以河南省潢川专区为例，卷入运粮热潮的农民、运输工人，为数即达十余万人。湖南省湘乡县所属运虞乡，原来农民存在很大顾虑，经过减租退租及召开农民代表会之后，运粮人数很快地增加。
    各地大都采用以工代赈及包运发价的办法，组织群众参加运输，使在完成运粮任务的同时，解决了不少群众春荒期间的生活困难。如遭受水灾严重的湖南省常德专区，在组织运粮中即解决了灾民八万八千余人的生活与生产问题。各地群众运粮积极性因之都很高涨，涌现了许多克服困难、爱护国家物资的模范事迹。河南省开封市去潢川专区运粮的二千余架大车工人，在由商城县运粮到固始县途中，遇到特务和土匪拦途抢劫。老工人阎其林一面找人迅速向当地人民县政府报告，一面组织工人在附近农庄借用数十件农具进行抵抗，一直坚持到县政府所派武装赶到，使二十万斤粮食免于损失。湖南醴陵县运粮农民当下雨时脱下自己的蓑衣遮盖粮食。他们说：“宁可叫人湿，也不叫粮湿。”
    此外，自三月中旬中南区召开财政会议以后，各省均改进调粮机构，成立了包括交、运、接三方面主要负责人参加的运粮司令部，以统一和加强领导。同时，对各地某些政府工作人员的本位观念等错误偏向，也进行了必要的批评。
    由于上述这些原因，中南区调运粮食工作中的各项困难在最近一月以来都已大体克服，运粮速度因而大大提高。如江西省外调粮一、二两月份完成任务百分之十，三月份完成任务百分之三十一，而在四月份上半月，即完成任务达百分之三十二。全区外调粮食，自一月至三月底为止的三个月内，仅完成总任务百分之四十八，四月份截至二十日止，二十天内即完成任务百分之四十四。
