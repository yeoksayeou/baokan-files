　　Ninghe Spring Planting Fully Underway
    180,000 Mu of Early-Maturing Crops Have Been Sown, and Sorghum Sowing is Now Beginning.
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Shaowen reports: With the assistance of the Central People's Government's disaster relief grain loans, and through their own efforts at production and self-salvation, the disaster victims of Ninghe County have overcome the winter famine and completed the sowing of 180,000 mu of spring wheat and over 6,000 mu of early-maturing crops. Now, the county's spring planting is gradually unfolding in full swing. According to statistics from six districts, thirty-three villages have begun sowing sorghum. Eight villages in the Sixth District have already sown 2,000 mu. In Xiaozhu Village, Sixth District, seventeen households have planted 100 mu of sorghum. Zhang Linshan, fearing the land would dry out and prevent planting, started early, using manpower to pull the soil and has already planted sixteen mu of sorghum. He said, "Planting one mu early is planting one mu." In the county's spring planting, attention has also been paid to integrating sideline production. For example, in Houbangdaogu Village, First District, Party member cadres actively provided leadership, organizing the masses to overcome difficulties. Zhang Fugui and Zhang Fucheng, two households with eleven people, had two head of livestock and four fishing nets, but did not know how to mend the nets. They found an old man who knew how to mend fishing nets and cure fish, and freely formed a group. In this way, they cure fish early every day, being able to cure forty jin, and after breakfast, they carry out spring plowing. This experience motivated the entire village, and quickly organized thirty-three mutual aid teams. At the same time, attention was also paid to mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in field production. In Duzhuang Village, Sixth District, the women's cadre Chen Xiuying and four others, worked and produced at the same time, motivating the women of the entire village, and proposed a competition with the men. In Qianyufei Village, First District, eighteen-year-old woman Cai Jinglian, with a family of four, had no male labor and cultivated ten mu of land, relying solely on her to cultivate. Because of her good labor, others were willing to form groups with her. Statistics from the six districts show that eight hundred and ninety-four women have participated in field production.

　　宁河春播全面开展
    十八万亩早熟作物已经播完现正开始播种高粱。
    【本报讯】通讯员绍文报导：宁河县灾民经中央人民政府赈贷粮的扶助，及生产自救的努力，已战胜冬荒，并完成了十八万亩春麦和六千余亩早熟作物的播种。现全县春播已逐渐全面开展。据六个区的统计，即有三十三个村开始播种高粱。六区八个村已种完二千亩。六区小朱庄已有十七户种了百亩高粱，张林山怕地干种不上，早下手，用人力拉坌子已种上十六亩高粱。他说：“早种一亩是一亩。”在全县春播中，并注意了结合副业生产。如一区后帮道沽村，党员干部积极领导，组织群众克服了困难。张福贵、张福成二户十一口人，有二头牲畜、四付网，但是不会补网，他们就找了一位会补鱼网会治鱼的老头，自由结合了一个小组。这样每天起大早治鱼，能治四十斤，早饭后进行春耕。这经验带动全村，很快就组织起三十三个互助小组。同时还注意了发动广大妇女参加田间生产。六区杜庄妇女干部陈秀英等五人，一面工作一面生产，带动全村妇女，并提出与男人比赛。一区前于飞庄十八岁的妇女蔡景莲，全家四口人，没有男劳动力，种着十亩地。只靠她来种地。由于她劳动的好，别人都愿意与她结成小组。六个区统计，已有八百九十四名妇女参加了田间生产。
