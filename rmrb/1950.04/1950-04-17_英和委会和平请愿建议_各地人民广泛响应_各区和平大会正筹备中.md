　　Xinhua News Agency, Sixteenth Dispatch: A movement to support peace and oppose the preparation for war is unfolding widely in Britain, according to a comprehensive TASS London dispatch.
    The national petition movement organized by the British Peace Committee, which demands peaceful negotiations through the United Nations and the banning of atomic bombs, has received a wide response. The London headquarters of the Peace Committee has received many letters requesting the immediate issuance of national peace petition forms. Twenty-five thousand forms, enough for five million signatures, have now been pre-ordered. Edinburgh has ordered five thousand copies. Other cities have responded in the same way. East Midlands, Lancashire, and West Wales have decided to hold local peace conferences. Plans to convene peace conferences in other regions are also underway. The British Legion, an organization of World War I veterans, is scheduled to hold its annual meeting at the Albert Hall in London in May. It is expected that more than two thousand representatives will attend the annual meeting. The meeting agenda will include a proposal to convene mass rallies, "aiming at launching a national movement to strive for peace."
