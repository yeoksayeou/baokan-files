To the Editors:

　　We have received the suggestion from Mr. Lin Qian, forwarded by you, that the "Russian Language Lectures" should allocate a certain amount of time to broadcast from the beginning. In order to accommodate listeners with slower learning progress, this station has been extracting half an hour every day since the 15th of last month to review from the first book, and is now reviewing the third book. It is impossible to start teaching from scratch again in terms of time. The purpose of broadcasting Russian language lectures is to help everyone acquire preliminary knowledge of Russian language and literature. Each session is tentatively scheduled for eight to ten months, and will be reopened after completion. This session has been running for more than four months, and it can be reopened in another four or five months.

### “俄语讲座”期满将重开

　　“俄语讲座”期满将重开编辑同志：
    你们转来林千先生所提“俄语讲座”应抽出一定的时间从头广播的建议已收到。本台为了照顾一部分学习进度慢的听众，已经从上月十五日起，每天抽出半小时由第一册开始复习，现在已复习到第三册。如果再从新教起，在时间上是不可能的。广播俄语讲座教学的目的，是为了帮助大家获得初步的俄语俄文的知识。每期暂定八个月至十个月，期满后重新开办。这一期已经进行了四个多月，再待四五个月就可以重新开始了。
