　　Anxin Zhongliuli Village Branch Creates Disaster Area Branch Education Experience
    Anxin County Committee, Li Pu
    The Zhongliuli Village Branch in the Second District of Anxin County has a total of forty-four Communist Party members (including fourteen women), accounting for over seven percent of the village's seven hundred and sixty-two residents. Before last year's flood, they were generally able to complete their work tasks on schedule, and the branch's educational work was also able to proceed, but without a fixed system. After the flood, the masses' thinking became chaotic, and the branch members were also uneasy. Branch work and branch education collapsed. Individual branch committee members were preoccupied with making a living for themselves, going out to do business, and neglecting the organization of the masses for production and self-salvation. This situation continued for two months. Later, after inspection and assistance from the county and district committees and the efforts of the branch committee members, the branch education that had been suspended for two months was finally restored, and it was even better than before the flood, creating methods and experiences for branch education in disaster areas. It received commendation from the county committee at the county party congress. Their methods for restoring branch education are:
    First, by educating the branch, clarifying thinking, raising awareness, and establishing the confidence of branch members in leading production for self-salvation and restoring branch education. In response to the branch members' abandonment of leadership in production for self-salvation and the collapse of branch work, the county and district committees educated them, prompting them to engage in discussions and helping them make several self-criticisms, clarifying the erroneous thoughts of selfishness and the idea that production does not need leadership, as well as various pessimistic sentiments. Everyone's ideological understanding was enhanced, recognizing that Communist Party members cannot bow their heads in the face of any difficulty and should stand up to help the masses find ways to overcome difficulties. Everyone reviewed their previous mistakes and resolved to restore branch work.
    Second, restoring branch education should be combined with production for self-salvation. Once there are solutions to livelihood, there will be solutions to work and study. Through the organization and mobilization of party members, ninety-seven households participated in the fish management mutual aid group, rectifying three plots of flooded land (preparing the land for fishing before freezing), totaling more than one hundred and fifty mu. Each plot's fish production could be exchanged for more than forty dan of corn. Women were also organized to twist ropes and make screens (fishing traps made of reeds). The eight hundred and forty screens used for fishing were all made by the women. This not only solved the livelihood problems of party members and the masses but also laid the foundation for spring plowing and sound branch education work.
    In this way, by the end of last November, work had become active, and branch education was restored. Because the party members were determined to study, they quickly organized about one hundred people to participate in the people's school. Every evening, party members learned literacy in the people's school, and after class, they attended Party lessons, studying Party constitution materials and the branch newsletter, and discussing how to improve production. Everyone's enthusiasm was high, and seven people, including Xue Dianying, were selected as study models. They decided through discussion that this kind of learning should be maintained for a long time. Now, due to the busy farming season, it has been changed to once every three days for Party lessons, and it has been proposed that discussion and connection with reality should be strengthened in the study.

　　安新中六里村支部创造灾区支部教育经验
    安新县委会李璞
    安新县二区中六里村支部共有共产党员四十四人（内妇女十四人），占全村七百六十二口人的百分之七强，在去年水灾以前，一般工作任务尚能按期完成；支部教育工作也能进行，但是没有一定的制度。水灾后，群众思想混乱，支部党员也皇皇不安，支部工作，支部教育就垮了台。个别支委光顾自己谋生活，出外作买卖，对组织群众生产自救不闻不问。这种情况一直继续了两个来月，后来经过县区委的检查、帮助与支委的努力，终于把停顿了两个来月的支部教育又恢复起来，而且比水灾前搞的还好，给水灾区的支部教育创造了办法和经验。全县党代会上得到了县委表扬。他们恢复支部教育的办法是：
    第一、通过对支部进行教育，打通思想，提高认识，树立支部党员领导生产自救，恢复支部教育的信心。针对该村支部党员对生产自救放弃领导，与支部工作垮台的情况，县委区委对他们进行了教育，使他们展开讨论，并帮助他们作了几次检讨和自我批评，澄清了当时自私自利及生产不用领导等错误思想和种种悲观情绪。大家思想认识提高了一步，认识了共产党员在任何困难面前不能低头，应该挺身而出帮助群众想办法克服困难。大家检讨了以前的错误，决心恢复支部工作。
    第二、恢复支部教育，要和生产自救结合起来，生活有了办法，工作、学习也就有了办法。经过党员的组织动员，有九十七户参加了治鱼互助组，共整汕地（结冻前整治好打鱼的水地）三块合一百五十多亩，每块所产的鱼能换玉米四十多石。并组织妇女搓绳子打箔（用苇子结成的治鱼包），出汕用的八百四十块箔，都是妇女们打的。这样不但解决了党员、群众的生活问题，并给春耕和健全支部教育工作打下了基础。
    这样，在去年十一月底，工作活跃了，支部教育就恢复了起来。由于党员有了学习的决心，很快就组织了一百来人参加了民校，每晚党员在民校里学文化，结束后就上党课，学习党章教材和支部小报。并结合讨论怎样搞好生产。大家情绪很高，薛佃英等七人被选为学习模范。他们讨论决定，要把这种学习长期坚持下去。现在因农忙，已改为三天上党课一次。并提出在学习中要加强讨论和联系实际。
