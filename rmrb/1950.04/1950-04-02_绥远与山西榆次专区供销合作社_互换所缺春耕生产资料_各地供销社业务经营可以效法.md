Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th -- The Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Shanxi Province and the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing General Cooperative have organized the mutual exchange of production materials lacking in both regions during spring ploughing, promoting spring ploughing production, and providing valuable experience for the current business of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions. To solve the difficulty of lacking livestock during spring ploughing, the Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative planned to organize its subordinate county supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase livestock from various production areas in Suiyuan Province as early as last month. However, because the cadres of each county were unfamiliar with the situation in Suiyuan, they had many concerns and were slow to act. At this time, the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing General Cooperative happened to send people to the Yangquan mining area to order agricultural implements and iron goods. The Yuci Special District Cooperative took this opportunity to send a special person to the Yangquan Supply and Marketing Cooperative on the 5th of this month to convene a meeting of county and village cooperatives. Participants included staff from Heshun, Xiyang, Pingding, Yuci, Yushe, Yangquan county and village cooperatives, totaling more than 40 people. In addition to making specific studies based on the livestock purchase plans of each county and bank loans, the person in charge of the Suiyuan Provincial General Cooperative used facts to explain that the social order in Suiyuan Province had undergone fundamental changes since liberation, and introduced the current situation in various parts of Suiyuan Province, resolving the concerns of the cadres of each county who were afraid of bandits, high prices, and failing to buy livestock and wasting money. Therefore, the meeting specifically determined the steps for purchasing based on the types of livestock needed by each county and the production areas of various livestock in Suiyuan Province, and the Suiyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing General Cooperative was responsible for helping with the procedures. A livestock purchasing team composed of 40 people from various county and village cooperatives was formed, including 15 experienced old farmers and livestock brokers. The grain and funds they carried were enough to buy about 400 various livestock, and it was expected that the task could be completed in one month.
    At the same time, the Yuci Special District Cooperative also helped the Suiyuan Supply and Marketing General Cooperative to order 240,000 catties of wrought iron and 15,000 iron shovels from various county cooperatives, totaling 320,000 catties of millet. It was determined that within ten days, the cadres of each county cooperative who went to Suiyuan Province to purchase livestock would withdraw the money from the Suiyuan Province Supply and Marketing General Cooperative at the Yangquan listed price.

　　绥远与山西榆次专区供销合作社
    互换所缺春耕生产资料
    各地供销社业务经营可以效法
    【新华社太原三十日电】山西省榆次专区供销社与绥远省供销总社有组织地互相交换两地春耕中所缺乏的生产资料，推动春耕生产，为各地供销合作社的当前业务提供了值得重视的经验。榆次专区供销社为解决春耕中缺乏牲口的困难，早在上月就计划组织所属各县供销社，赴绥远省各产地购买牲口。但因各县干部对绥远情况不了解，顾虑甚多，迟迟未能成行。这时，适值绥远省供销总社派人来阳泉工矿区订购农具、铁货。榆次专社便乘此机会于本月五日派专人到阳泉供销社召开了各县社及村社会议。参加会议者有和顺、昔阳、平定、榆次、榆社、阳泉等县社和村社的工作人员共四十余人。会议除按照各县购买牲口计划与银行贷款情况作了具体研究外，就由绥省总社负责人用事实说明了绥省解放后社会秩序已有了根本变化，并介绍了绥省目下各地情况，解决了到会各县干部怕土匪、怕价大、怕买不到牲口而白费盘钱等顾虑。于是会上便根据各县所需牲口种类及绥省各种牲口之产区，具体确定了购买的步骤，并由绥省供销总社负责帮助办理。由各县社、村社共四十人组成了赴绥购牲口队，其中并有有经验的老农和牲口牙纪十五人同往。所带粮款计可买各种牲口四百头左右，预计一个月可完成任务。
    与此同时，榆次专社也帮助绥远供销总社向各县社订购熟铁廿四万斤、铁锹一万五千张，共合小米卅二万斤，确定十天内按阳泉牌价折款由此次赴绥省购买牲口的各县社干部到绥省供销总社提款。
