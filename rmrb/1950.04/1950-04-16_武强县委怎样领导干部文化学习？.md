In February of this year, at the joint meeting of the Inner Mongolia Branch, provinces, and cities' propaganda departments convened by the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the achievements of the Wuqiang County Committee of Hebei Province in leading the cultural learning of cadres throughout the county were introduced. However, at that time, the introduction by the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee was not very specific. After the meeting, in addition to introducing the experience of cadre learning in the Second District of Zuoquan County based on the report of the Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, the North China Bureau's Propaganda Department also sent Comrade Ma Ziming to Wuqiang to conduct an investigation. This article is written by Comrade Ma based on the investigation materials. With the consent of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau, it is published in this column for reference by the propaganda departments of the Party in various places.
                                                      Editor

    In the winter of 1947 and the beginning of 1948, when land was divided in Wuqiang County, Hebei Province, many poor peasants and farm laborers were promoted to serve as cadres. At that time, most comrades mistakenly regarded having cultural knowledge as shameful and being uneducated and not learning as glorious. The county leadership also had a tendency to underestimate learning. A responsible comrade of the county party committee even satirized comrades who loved learning, saying, "Even if you study, you will still be hungry if you don't eat." Therefore, at that time, the cultural level of cadres in Wuqiang County was very low, and the proportion of illiterate and semi-literate people was very large. In 1948, among the 426 cadres in Wuqiang County, 80% were of peasant origin, and the majority were illiterate or semi-literate. For example, among the 67 cadres in the first, second, and third districts, 35 were illiterate or semi-literate; among the eight members of the county party committee, four were illiterate.
    Each time an enlarged cadre meeting was held in the county, the worker-peasant cadres present could not take notes. In the atmosphere of underestimating cultural knowledge, even those intellectuals who could take notes did not dare to do so, so that they forgot most of what was said after the meeting, and it was difficult to grasp and implement the instructions and policies of the higher authorities. For example, district cadres could not understand the documents on class division, so they determined class status based on their own experience and feelings, which made it impossible to correct the class status of wrongly criticized middle peasants quickly, and the work took a detour. Although this was mainly due to the harm caused by the "leftist" sentiment in the implementation of policies, the low cultural level of cadres was also one of the reasons for the losses suffered in the work.
    The county party committee gradually realized the seriousness and danger of the above situation from actual experience, and had repeatedly studied the issue of cadre cultural learning in several meetings, calling on cadres throughout the county to "recognize two characters every day," and stipulating learning discipline: criticism for not studying once, serious criticism for not studying twice, and dismissal for not studying three times. These learning regulations met with ideological resistance from many comrades. Most comrades believed that "poor peasant and farm laborer origin is good, the stand is firm, and uneducated people have also become ministers, county heads, and directors. What is the use of intellectuals? They are all from landlord and rich peasant families." Some also thought that "the work is busy, and there is no time to study," while others were willing to learn but were afraid of losing face, thinking, "I used to teach people, but now I have to learn from them. How can that be?" Some dared not write, fearing that others would laugh at them for writing incorrectly or poorly. Because the leadership failed to start from enlightening cadres' learning consciousness, but inappropriately emphasized overly leftist discipline, it aroused more ideological resistance. Comrades with a longer history of struggle, older qualifications, and older age thought, "I can still work without knowing how to read. I have never seen such a rule as dismissal for not studying three times! I will not study, and let's see how you dismiss me!"
    However, the county party committee recognized the harm of a low cultural level to the work, and was determined to lead the cadres of the whole county in cultural learning. Therefore, at various meetings and in individual talks, it repeatedly mobilized cadres ideologically. It emphasized that "learning is good for the work," "a firm stand must also have some culture to better grasp the policies. In the past, we neglected learning, and we made mistakes in implementing policies," and "new work in the future cannot be done well without learning." After such constant explanations of the importance of learning, the cadres of the whole county generally accepted the call of the county party committee to learn culture and began to learn actively. In order to strengthen the cultural learning of cadres, the county party committee successively transferred more than 60 young primary school teachers and assigned them to work in various districts and systems to facilitate the mutual assistance in learning. After about half a year, by October 1948, the cultural learning in the county really began.
    In the spring of 1949, Wuqiang County transferred more than 150 cadres again (including those with the lowest cultural level who could take notes, and more than 20 key figures in learning). At that time, more than 200 new cadres were promoted from the villages to fill the vacancies. Among these newly promoted cadres, illiterates accounted for about 60%. Therefore, the proportion of illiterates in the county was still very large, and cultural learning was still a very important task. Therefore, the leadership set different learning requirements for different cadres, corrected the general requirement of learning two characters per day in the past, and proposed "adults learn one character per day, young people learn two characters per day, and old people learn one character every two days." The county party committee also summarized the achievements of past learning. From October 1948 to January 1949, thirteen illiterate cadres in ten districts could write simple letters. In April, 37 people in four districts changed from illiterate to roughly literate, and 21 people changed from illiterate to being able to write simple letters and read newspapers. These achievements were pointed out to everyone, which increased the cadres' confidence in learning. The cadres of the whole county also felt the importance of cultural learning, and their learning enthusiasm was very high. For example, Wang Lichun, a production assistant in the First District, learned to write characters on the ground, Zhang Dekun, a public security officer in the Fourth District, still learned new characters while sleeping, and Huang Shufang, the deputy organizing committee member of the Sixth District, worked with her children and still learned more than 40 new characters in a month. The district party committees also grasped the leadership of learning and constantly mobilized cadres to learn. Cadres throughout Wuqiang County, like this, insisted on cultural learning and made rapid progress. According to statistics from October 1948 to March 1950, after one and a half years of cultural learning: among the 410 cadres in the county, 268 had a cultural level equivalent to or higher than that of senior primary school, accounting for slightly less than 65%; 74 people knew more than 700 characters, about the level of the third grade of elementary school, accounting for slightly more than 18%; 22 people knew 400 characters, accounting for slightly more than 5%; 46 people knew more than 100 characters, accounting for slightly more than 11%. There were no people who did not know any characters at all, and cadres who knew more than 100 characters to about 400 characters only accounted for slightly more than 16%. For example, Chang Dongdong, a clerk in the Third District, was illiterate when he started working, but now knows about 1,400 characters and can read general documents and newspapers and write letters. Li Shunen, a women's committee member in the Third District, was originally illiterate, but now knows 500 characters and can write letters and read branch newspapers. Sun Guiying, the propaganda committee member of the First District, originally knew 300 characters, but now knows 1,000 characters, can read the Hebei Daily, write simple letters, and write simple reports. Zhang Kaihe, the district secretary of the First District, originally knew 200 characters, but now knows 900 characters, can read newspapers and general documents, and can write work reports. This achievement can be said to be very great, and it has greatly changed the cultural level of cadres in 1948. Although 16% of Wuqiang cadres still only know less than 400 characters and need to continue to improve, and cadres who know more characters still need to continue to improve in literacy, arithmetic, natural science, and history and geography (it is best to have certain textbooks and education systems), they should not be complacent. However, the learning experience of Wuqiang cadres powerfully proves that county and district cadres working in the countryside can carry out cultural learning, and can eliminate illiteracy and semi-literacy among cadres and reach the level of elementary school graduation in two or three years.
    What methods did Wuqiang County adopt to achieve such achievements in the cultural learning of cadres throughout the county? This is because the Wuqiang County Committee attached importance to the cultural learning of cadres, insisted on leading cultural learning with determination, thereby mobilizing and enlightening cadres' conscious learning in many ways, overcoming ideological obstacles in learning, and taking various measures to help cadres learn, reversing the atmosphere of underestimating cultural learning among cadres. In addition, the district party committees also seriously led the learning, which made the cultural learning of the whole county successful. The leadership's emphasis and the enlightenment of cadres' consciousness are the most important keys to doing a good job in cadre learning, and also the main experience of cadre learning in Wuqiang. In addition to this, Wuqiang also adopted the following methods, which are also worth referring to.
    (1) Established a learning system. When cadres went to the countryside, work groups were established in groups, with a leader and deputy leader. The leader led the work, and the deputy leader led the learning. Mobilize each group and each person to formulate learning plans and carry out learning according to the plans. The leadership pays attention to properly assigning those with high cultural levels and those with low cultural levels to facilitate those with high culture to teach those with low culture in the work. Some taught new characters for a few days before dispersing to the villages, and reviewed themselves after dispersing to the villages. Some with low culture also wrote letters to each other with those with high culture to ask about new characters. Some taught and learned from each other when they were concentrated, and after dispersing to the villages, they established good relations with primary school teachers to solve the difficulty of literacy. As for comrades who know a little more characters, they learn phonetic symbols and use small dictionaries to help themselves learn. The learning requires "four abilities," that is, to be able to recognize, write, speak, and use.
    (2) Emphasize learning inspection and timely commendation, and establish a regular and irregular testing system. At the beginning of learning, the county will test the learning every time it gathers cadres, and commend the comrades who have achieved learning results at the conference. District cadres also gather in the district once every ten days, and small districts gather once every five days. When gathering, they must check the learning, have new character accounts, fill in new character tables, and compete for results. Advocate "three evaluations," that is, when studying cadres, evaluate their work enthusiasm, work depth, and learning efforts. In the organizational life of the Party, reviewing learning has also become one of the main contents, and learning has become one of the conditions for evaluating cadres.
    (3) Cultivate learning backbones. The county holds an enlarged meeting of propaganda and education committee members every month to specifically study methods for leading learning and help the leadership of each district. The districts also often pay attention to discovering and cultivating activists and learning backbones to drive everyone to learn. At present, in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts, among 109 cadres, there are 31 key and active members in learning, which is enough to drive the entire cadre learning.
    (4) Pay attention to the combination of learning and practical application. The methods of teaching literacy are extremely flexible. They often compile the central work into concise sentences for learning. What kind of work they do, they learn what kind of characters, such as "urging the collection of old loans," "issuing new loans," "organizing production," and "restoring old cooperatives." This kind of learning is closely combined with the work of cadres. Cadres feel the need, are interested, and learn quickly.

### 武强县委怎样领导干部文化学习？

　　武强县委怎样领导干部文化学习？
    今年二月，在中共中央华北局召开的内蒙分局、各省、市宣传联席会上，曾介绍了河北武强县委领导全县干部学习文化的成绩，但当时因河北省委宣传部的介绍尚不很具体，会后，华北局宣传部除根据山西省委宣传部的报告介绍了左权二区干部学习的经验外，并派马子明同志亲自到武强做了调查，此文即是马同志根据调查材料所写。现经华北局宣传部同意，发表于本栏，供各地党的宣传部门工作的借鉴。
                                                      编者
    河北武强县在一九四七年冬和一九四八年初平分土地时，曾提拔了不少贫雇农出来担任干部，那时一般同志误以有文化知识为耻辱，以老粗不学习为光荣。县的领导上也存在着轻视学习的思想，甚至县委某负责同志，还讽刺爱学习的同志，说：“你们学习，不吃饭也一样饿的慌。”因此当时武强全县干部的文化水平很低，文盲与半文盲的比重很大。一九四八年武强全县干部四百二十六人中，农民出身的占百分之八十，而文盲半文盲即占大半。如一、二、三区的干部共六十七人中，文盲半文盲三十五人；县委八人，即有四个文盲。
    每次召开全县扩大干部会议时，到会工农干部不会作记录，知识分子在轻视文化知识的空气下，本来能记的也不敢作记录，以致开完会就忘了大半，对上级指示和政策都难以掌握贯彻。如区干部看不懂划阶级的文件，就依自己的经验和自己的感想定成分，使错斗中农不能很快改正成分，工作走了弯路。这虽主要是执行政策上“左”的情绪为害，但干部文化水平低，也是工作遭受损失的原因之一。
    县委从实际体验中逐渐感到上述情况的严重与危险，曾先后在几次会议上研究干部的文化学习问题，号召全县干部“每天识两个字”，并规定学习纪律：一次不学习受批评，二次不学习受严重批评，三次不学习撤职。这些学习规定，遇到了不少同志的思想抵抗，大部分同志认为“贫雇农成分好，立场稳，老粗也当了部长、县长、主任，知识分子有什么用？都是地主、富农出身”。也有的认为“工作忙，没时间学习”，还有愿意学习但怕丢人的，认为“以前总是教训人，现在跟人家学习，那怎么行？”有的不敢写字，怕写错、写不好别人笑话。由于领导上未能很好从启发干部的学习自觉上着手，而是不适当地强调过左的纪律，更加引起了思想抵抗，斗争历史较长、资格较老、年龄较大的同志，认为“不识字也照样工作，三次不学习要撤职，我还没见过这章程！我就不学习，看你怎样把我撤职吧！”
    但县委认识了文化水平低对于工作的妨害，有决心领导全县干部进行文化学习，于是在各种会议上及个别谈话时，对干部进行反复思想动员。强调说明：“学习对工作有好处”、“立场稳，还必须有点文化才好掌握政策，以前忽视学习，执行政策中就犯错误”、“今后新的工作，不学习就做不好”，如此不断的解释学习的重要意义。县委又于一九四八年“七七”时，在全县发动了一个“回忆运动”，要求全县干部进行反省，检查自己几年来对党作了一些什么工作，目前自己还有什么缺点。这样启发之后，全县干部一般的接受了县委学习文化的号召，开始积极学习起来。县委为了加强干部的文化学习，先后又调了六十多个青年小学教员，分配到各区各系统工作，便于发挥学习中的互助作用。经过约半年的时间，到一九四八年十月时，全县的文化学习，才真正开展起来。
    一九四九年春，武强县又调出一百五十多个干部（其中文化水平最低的也能作记录，并有二十多个学习中的骨干），当时曾从村里提拔新干部二百多人补充缺额，这些新提拔的干部，文盲约占百分之六十，因此全县文盲的比重还是很大，文化学习仍然是很重要的工作。于是领导上对不同的干部又规定了不同的学习要求，改正了过去每人每天识两字的一般要求，提出“壮年每天识一字，青年每天识两字，老年两天识一字”。县委还总结了过去学习的成绩，自一九四八年十月至一九四九年一月，十个区有十三个文盲干部会写便信了。四月份，四个区又有三十七人由文盲变成粗识文字，和二十一人由文盲能写便信看报，把这些成绩指给大家看，增加了干部的学习信心。全县干部也感到文化学习的重要，学习情绪都很高，如一区生产助理员王立春在地上学写字，四区公安员张德坤在睡觉时还学生字，六区副组织委员黄淑芳带着孩子工作，一个月还学会四十多个生字。区委也抓紧了对学习的领导，不断地动员干部学习。武强全县干部，像这样坚持文化学习，进步很快，根据一九四八年十月到一九五○年三月，经过一年半文化学习后的统计：全县干部四百一十人，文化水平相当高小及高小以上的二百六十八人，占百分之六十五弱；识七百字以上约当初小三年级程度的七十四人，占百分之十八强；识四百字的二十二人，占百分之五强；识一百字以上的四十六人，占百分之十一强。一字不识的人完全没有了，而识百字以上到四百字左右的干部，也只占百分之十六强。如三区文书常东洞，参加工作时不识字，现认识一千四百字左右，能看一般文件报纸并能写信。三区妇委李淑嫩，原来不识字，现认五百字，能写信看支部报。一区宣传委员孙桂英，原识三百字，现已识一千字，能看河北日报，写便信，写简单报告。一区区书张开河，原识二百字，现已识九百字，能看报纸与一般文件，并能写工作报告。这个成绩可以说是很大的，大大改变了一九四八年时干部中的文化水平。虽然武强干部文化学习还有百分之十六强的干部只识四百以下的字，还须要继续提高，而识字较多的干部，也还须在识字上、算术上、自然科学与史地知识上（最好都有一定的课本和学制）继续提高，不应自满，但是武强干部的学习经验，有力地证明了分散在农村的县区在职干部，是能够进行文化学习的，而且能够在二三年内扫除干部中的文盲与半文盲，达到初小毕业的程度。
    武强县采用了什么办法，使全县干部的文化学习，获得了这样的成绩呢？这是由于上述武强县委对于干部文化学习重视，坚持领导文化学习有决心，从而多方动员和启发干部的自觉学习，克服学习上的思想障碍，并采取了各种措施帮助干部学习，扭转了干部中轻视文化学习的空气，加之区委也认真领导学习，这才把全县的文化学习搞好。领导上的重视与启发干部的自觉，乃是搞好干部学习最重要的关键，也是武强干部学习的主要经验。除此以外，武强还采取了以下的办法，也是值得参考的。
    （一）建立了学习制度。干部下乡时，分片成立工作组，设正副组长，正组长领导工作，副组长领导学习。发动各组各人订立学习计划，并依照计划进行学习。领导上注意把文化程度高的和文化程度低的适当配备开，便于在工作中文化高的教文化程度低的学习文化。有的在分散到村之前先教几天生字，分散到村后自己复习。有的文化低的还和文化高的互相写信，问生字。有的在集中时，互教互学，分散到村后和小学教员搞好关系，解决识字的困难。至于识字稍多一点的同志就学习注音字母拼音，利用小字典，帮助自己学习。在学习上要求“四会”，要会认、会写、会讲、会用。
    （二）强调学习检查与及时表扬，建立定期的和不定期的测验制度。在学习开始时，县里每集合一次干部，就要测验一次学习，并在大会上表扬学习有成绩的同志。区干部也十天在区集合一次，小区五天集合一次，集合时都要检查学习，要生字账，填生字表，比赛成绩。提倡“三评”，即研究干部时要评他的工作积极，工作深入和学习努力情形。在党的组织生活上，检讨学习也成为主要内容之一，学习成为鉴定干部的条件之一。
    （三）培养学习骨干。县每月要召开一次宣教委员扩大会议，专门研究领导学习的方法，帮助各区的领导。区也经常注意发现培养积极分子与学习骨干，以便带动大家学习。现一、二、三、四、五区，一百零九个干部中即有三十一个学习中的骨干分子与积极分子，足可带动整个干部学习起来。
    （四）注意学习与实用的结合。教学识字的方法极为灵活，常把中心工作编成简明的句子，进行学习，作什么工作，就学什么字，如“催收旧贷”、“发放新贷”、“组织生产”、“恢复旧社”等。这样的学习，与干部的工作紧密结合，干部感到需要，有兴趣，而且学习也很快。
