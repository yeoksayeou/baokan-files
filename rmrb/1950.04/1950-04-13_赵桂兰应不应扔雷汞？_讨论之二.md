　　Should Zhao Guilan Have Thrown the Fulminate of Mercury?
    ——Discussion Two
    In the March 10th column, the article "Love Zhao Guilan" mentioned that teachers at Dalian No. 1 Elementary School had a debate when discussing whether Zhao Guilan should have thrown the "fulminate of mercury." At that time, the editor hoped that readers could展开 the discussion on this issue. Since then, we have continuously received letters from readers, expressing their opinions on this issue. Many readers clearly recognized from this issue that when a Party member's personal interests conflict with the overall interests of the Party, the Party member should decisively sacrifice the individual to take care of the whole. However, some readers compare the situation from the perspectives of cadres and assets, believing that it is currently difficult to obtain assets, so Zhao Guilan's approach was correct, but it would not be correct to do so in the future. Some readers believe that the loss of assets is limited, while the lives of cadres are more valuable, thus saying that Zhao Guilan's handling of herself was a waste of life. Now we are publishing these opinions, hoping that readers from all regions will participate in the discussion and come to a unified and correct conclusion, in order to help the vast number of readers receive more education and inspiration from Comrade Zhao Guilan's spirit of courageous self-sacrifice. ——Editor
　　Comrade Zhao Guilan Helped Me Put Down My Burden
    Qin Dasheng
    "Party Life" has given me great inspiration and education. Especially after reading "The Good Daughter of the Communist Party – Zhao Guilan," I was deeply moved. It was really a great lesson for me. I thought, what would I do if I encountered that situation myself? It must be very simple. Human life is important. How could I care about the people's property, machines, and houses? Wouldn't throwing the "fulminate of mercury" out defuse the danger! But after reading this article and Zhou Fufang's "Comrade Zhao Guilan, I Want to Learn from You," my thinking changed dramatically. I realized that my own ideas only considered personal interests, regardless of the losses of the country and the people, purely a manifestation of individualism and fear of death. Now I am different. If I also encountered that situation, I would definitely clench my teeth and work hard, forgetting life and death, and never throw the fulminate of mercury, even if it meant being smashed to pieces. At the same time, when I sometimes get emotional and think about my family and how they are doing, whether they have difficulties, how to find ways to help them, but I am on a supply system and cannot help them, it seems like a burden. But in reality, my family wouldn't have much difficulty. As long as everyone works and produces, they can still become prosperous under the leadership and help of the government. But I always dwell on these non-existent problems, creating my own misery. At this time, I think of the good daughter of the Communist Party – Comrade Zhao Guilan. How unselfishly she works for the country and the people, and is respected and loved by everyone. As soon as I think of this, I involuntarily put down this burden and feel relaxed and happy. Indeed, the revolution is for the benefit of millions of people, so how can we only care about our own interests? "Party Life" has educated me and strengthened my belief in serving the people wholeheartedly. Because only in this way is it the most glorious.
　　Zhao Guilan Was Not Lost in the Revolutionary Camp
    Gao Shuangyin
　　In the current situation, Zhao Guilan was right not to throw the "fulminate of mercury," because machines are more important now.
   Nai Dong
    Regarding whether Comrade Zhao Guilan should have thrown out the "fulminate of mercury," my understanding is this: In that situation, for Comrade Zhao Guilan, it was a struggle between personal interests and the interests of the entire revolution. If she had cherished her personal interests, she could have thrown the "fulminate of mercury" away in that serious situation. However, under the cultivation and guidance of the Communist Party, her strong will made her truly forget the "personal" problem. In order to take care of the Party's interests and the future of the revolutionary cause, she held the "fulminate of mercury" in her hand and it exploded! She became a disabled person in a pool of blood! We sympathize with her situation. But in the revolutionary camp, we have not lost a lovely comrade because of this. On the contrary, she will be even stronger. At the same time, Comrade Zhao Guilan brings us infinite courage and confidence. I believe that her deeds will inspire the workers and comrades in the motherland, in Dalian and Lushun, especially in the Jianxin Factory, to intensify production and support the front lines with labor enthusiasm, and create more new records.
    Regarding whether Comrade Zhao Guilan should have thrown out the fulminate of mercury, I think it is necessary to look at the entire reality of the problem, to look at the direct or indirect impact of this matter on the national interest, and to look at the main and secondary aspects, as well as the timing. Starting from these principles, I think it was right not to throw out the "fulminate of mercury." Why?
    Because although our current work is mainly focused on restoration and construction, the war has not completely ended. Taiwan and Tibet are urgently awaiting liberation. The US-Chiang bandit planes are frantically bombing and destroying our industrial construction in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other places. Therefore, we must step up production to support the front lines. Machines and raw materials are the main elements in production. In addition, China suffered serious damage to industrial production from the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation. Machines are scarce, so if Comrade Zhao Guilan had thrown out the "fulminate of mercury," destroying machines and raw materials, it would immediately affect production, affect support for the front lines, and affect the construction of the new society. This is a series of practical problems. Looking at it this way, if the "fulminate of mercury" is thrown out, how much impact would it have on the national interest, and how much loss would the national property suffer?! Therefore, I feel that not throwing it out was the right thing to do.
    Of course, a good and excellent cadre makes a great contribution to the revolutionary cause. If he is lost, it is a great loss to national construction and the revolutionary cause. But in the current situation, machines, raw materials, etc., are more important than cadres. Because now we need to quickly liberate Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Tibet, and completely eliminate the reactionaries, we need to step up production to support the front lines. Without machines and raw materials, even if there are very good cadres to lead, it will not work. So I say that cadres are less important at the moment.
    If we completely eliminate the reactionaries, build a good New Democratic society, and move towards a socialist society, our national property will be rich, there will be more machines, and there will be no shortage of raw materials. At that time, if we lose some machines and raw materials, the impact on the national interest will not be too great. And at that time, cadres will be more important than national property. This is the relationship of time, that is, the views and solutions to problems are different at different times.
　　Wang Zhihong:
    Can We Learn from Zhao Guilan?
    After seeing Comrade Zhao Guilan's deeds, many readers have vowed to learn from her. Indeed, Comrade Zhao Guilan's overall concept of putting the public before the private and sacrificing herself, and the outstanding deeds she created, can deeply move and inspire people. But the incident itself, I think, still has serious issues of right and wrong. If we were in a situation similar to hers, should we learn from her approach?
    I believe that Zhao Guilan's decisive sacrifice of herself to protect national assets can only be said to be admirable in spirit. But her handling method was wrong and inappropriate.
    Judging from the situation, the explosive power of the "fulminate of mercury" in her hand was not too great, because she was able to retain residual life after it exploded in her hand. From this, it seems that even if she threw the "fulminate of mercury" out, it would not necessarily fall on important equipment and cause significant damage. Even if it was thrown incorrectly, such a small explosive force would not necessarily cause much serious damage. And this loss seems to be less than the loss of the life of an outstanding and excellent Communist Party member. Because the loss of assets is limited and has a price, while life is unlimited and priceless. So I say that Zhao Guilan's handling of her own life is a waste, and she has forgotten her future tasks. Naturally, she sacrificed her personal interests for the interests of the Party at the time, but her personal interests are not equal to her health and life! The strength that her young life exerts for the revolution, is it not in the interest of the Party? In order to adhere to the task given to her by the Party, she has the right to protect her health and value her life, so that she does not fail the education given to her by the Party.
    Comrade Zhao Guilan sacrificed her precious life in order to protect some limited assets. As a result, she cannot work wholeheartedly for the Party as before, and the Party has to take care of her instead. May I ask how much benefit does she do for the Party and for the people by doing this?

### 赵桂兰应不应扔雷汞？——讨论之二

专栏：讨论问题

　　赵桂兰应不应扔雷汞？
    ——讨论之二
    三月十日本栏《热爱赵桂兰》一文中曾述及大连市第一完小的教师们在讨论赵桂兰应不应扔“雷汞”时，发生了争论。当时编者提出希望读者能就这个问题展开讨论。以后即不断收到读者来信，对这一问题纷纷表示意见。很多读者从这个问题中明确认识了党员个人利益与党的整体利益发生矛盾时，党员应该断然地牺牲个人顾全整体。但有的读者却从干部和资财两方面来比较，认为现在资财来源困难，赵桂兰的作法是对的，将来再这样作就不对了。有的读者认为资财损失是有限的，而干部的生命更可宝贵，因而说赵桂兰这样处理自己是对生命的一种浪费。现在我们把这些意见发表，希望各地读者参加讨论，得出一致的正确的结论，以帮助广大读者从赵桂兰同志勇于自我牺牲的精神中得到更多的教育和启发。                          ——编者
　　赵桂兰同志帮助我放下了包袱
    秦达生
    《党的生活》对我有很大的启发与教育。尤其当看了《共产党的好女儿——赵桂兰》以后，我深受感动，真是给我上了一次大课。我想假如自己也遭遇了那种情况，该怎么办呢？那一定很简单，人命要紧，那还能管那些人民的财产机器房屋呢？“雷汞”扔出去，不也就化险为夷了吗！但读了这篇文章及周抚方的“赵桂兰同志我要向你学习”以后，我思想起了急剧的变化，我认识到自己的想法，只顾个人的利益，不管国家人民的损失，纯是个人主义、贪生怕死的表现。现在我就不一样了，假如我亦遇到那种情况，一定要咬定牙关，冒死忘生去干，绝不扔雷汞，就是粉身碎骨也在所不惜的。同时当我有时闹情绪想到家里也不知怎么样，有困难吧，怎么想法接济接济，但自己又是供给制，接济不了，这好像成了个包袱似的。但实际家中也不会有多大困难，只要人人劳动，人人生产，在政府领导帮助下还能生产致富呢？但自己却老在这些不成问题的事情上打转转，自找苦闷。这时我就想到共产党的好女儿——赵桂兰同志了，人家是怎样忘我地为国为民，受到人人的崇敬爱戴。一想到这，自己情不由主的把这个包袱放下了，觉着轻松愉快。的确的革命是为千千万万人的，那能只顾一己利益呢？“党的生活”教育了我，坚定了我的全心全意为人民服务的信念。因为只有这样才是最光荣的。
　　革命阵营里并未失掉赵桂兰
    高双印
　　在目前情况下，赵桂兰不扔“雷汞”是对的，因为现在机器更重要一些。
   耐冬
    赵桂兰同志应不应扔出“雷汞”，我的认识是这样的：在当时的情况下，对于赵桂兰同志说就是个人利益与革命全体利益的斗争。假若珍惜个人的利益，在那样严重的情况下，她是很可以将“雷汞”扔开的。但是，在共产党的培育与教导下，她的坚强的意志使她实实在在地把“个人”的问题忘掉了。为了顾全党的利益与革命事业的前途，她把“雷汞”握在手中爆炸了！她变为血泊中的残疾人了！我们同情她的遭遇。但在革命阵营里，并未因此而失掉一位可爱的同志。相反的，她会更坚强的。同时赵桂兰同志给我们带来了无限的勇气与信心，我相信，她的事迹必会鼓舞起在祖国、在旅大、尤其是在建新工厂的工友们、同志们的加紧生产支援前线的劳动热情，而创造出更多的新纪录。
    关于赵桂兰同志应不应扔出雷汞，我认为要从问题的整个的实际来看，要从这件事对国家利益直接影响或间接影响来看，要从主要性和次要性以及时间性来看。从这些原则出发，我认为不扔出“雷汞”是对的。为什么呢？
    因为我们现在的工作虽然主要是在恢复建设，但是战事还没有完全结束，台湾、西藏等地急待解放，美蒋匪机在上海、南京、杭州、广州、青岛等地，疯狂滥炸破坏我们的工业建设，因之必须加紧生产，支援前线。机器、原料是生产中的主要要素，加以我国在八年抗日，三年解放战争中，工业生产遭受日寇和国民党匪帮的严重破坏，机器缺少，所以赵桂兰同志如把“雷汞”扔出炸毁了机器原料等，立即影响生产，影响支援前线，影响新社会的建设。这是一连串的实际问题。这样看来如果把“雷汞”扔出对于国家的利益有着多大的影响，国家的财产要受多大的损失？！因此我觉得不扔出去是对的。
    固然一个好的优秀的干部对于革命事业贡献很大。如果失掉了他，对于国家建设及革命事业是很大的损失。但是在现在的情况下，机器、原料等要比干部重要。因为现在我们要迅速解放台湾、海南岛、西藏，把反动派彻底消灭，需要加紧生产，支援前线，如果没有机器，原料，纵然有多好的干部来领导，也是不成的。所以我说在目前干部较次要。
    如果我们把反动派彻底消灭后，新民主主义建设好，走向社会主义社会的时候，我们国家的财产丰富了，机器多了，原料也不缺乏了，那时如果损失点机器，原料，对国家利益的影响就不会太大。而那时的干部就较国家财产为重要了，这是时间的关系，也就是在不同的时间，对于问题的看法和解决方法是不同的。
　　汪志鸿：
    可以学习赵桂兰吗？
    很多读者看到赵桂兰同志的事迹后，都立誓要学习他。的确，赵桂兰同志公而忘私牺牲自己的整体观念，她所创造出的卓越事迹是能够深深地感动人激发人的。但这次事件的本身，我认为还存在着严重的是非问题。假使我们处在和她类似的情况下，应不应该学习她的作法？
    我认为赵桂兰为了保护国家资财而断然牺牲自己，这也不过仅仅可以说其精神可佩。但她的处理方法却是错误的、不恰当的。
    就情况看，她手里拿的“雷汞”的爆炸力量并不太大，因为在她手里爆炸后，她还能得到残余的生命。这样看来，就是她把“雷汞”扔出去，也不一定就会落到重要器材上，使之蒙受重大损失。即使扔得不对，像那样小的爆炸力也不见得会引起多么严重的损失。而这损失比起一个卓越优秀的共产党员的生命损失，似乎要逊色一些。因为资财的损失是有限的，有价的，而生命则是无限的无价的。所以我说赵桂兰这样处理自己的生命是一种浪费，是忘了她将来的任务。自然当时她是为了党的利益而牺牲个人利益的，但她个人的利益并不等于她的健康和生命啊！她年青的生命为革命所发挥的力量，难道不是党的利益？为了坚持党给她的任务，她有权保护自己的健康和重视自己的生命，这样才不辜负党给她的教育。
    赵桂兰同志为了保护一些有限的资财，而付出了自己的宝贵生命。这样一来，她不能全心全力像以前一样的为党工作了，党反而要照顾她了，请问她这样做对于党对于人民有多大利益呢？
