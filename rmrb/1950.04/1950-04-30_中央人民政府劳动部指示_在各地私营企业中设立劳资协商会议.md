Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: The Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions to labor bureaus across the country regarding the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in private enterprises. The full text is as follows:

　　I. In accordance with the People's Government's policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," in private industrial and commercial enterprises, to facilitate consultation between labor and management on specific issues related to improving production, business, and employee benefits, labor-management consultation meetings may be established with the agreement of both labor and management.

　　II. The organization of labor-management consultation meetings generally applies to private factories and shops employing 50 or more people. For those employing fewer than 50 people, the matter may be handled with reference to the spirit of these instructions and specific circumstances. At the same time, if both labor and management in the same industry or trade in the same city deem it necessary, a labor-management consultation meeting for that industry or trade may also be established.

　　III. Labor-management consultation meetings are organs for equal consultation between labor and management and are not responsible for business operations or administrative management.

　　IV. The composition of labor-management consultation meetings shall be based on the principle that the labor and management representative bodies each send an equal number of representatives (in the consultation meeting of an enterprise unit, the business owner or his appointed manager, the factory director of the enterprise unit, and the chairman of the trade union organization shall be ex officio representatives). The number of representatives from both sides shall be determined through consultation, generally two to six people per side.

　　V. Representatives participating in labor-management consultation meetings should be relatively fixed. After both sides have selected their representatives, they should notify the other party of the representatives' names. However, when necessary, both parties have the right to replace their representatives.

　　VI. Labor-management consultation meetings in industrial and commercial enterprises should have regular meetings. The number of meetings per month shall be determined through consultation between the two parties. In addition to regular meetings, when necessary, a meeting may be convened at any time upon the proposal of one party and with the consent of the other party. Labor-management consultation meetings in the same industry or trade do not need to stipulate a fixed meeting schedule and can be convened when both parties agree.

　　VII. The chairman of the labor-management consultation meeting shall be assumed in turn by the representatives of both labor and management attending the meeting (for example, if a labor representative serves as chairman once, the next time a management representative shall serve as chairman). The chairman on duty shall be responsible for convening each meeting.

　　VIII. With the agreement of both labor and management, the labor-management consultation meeting may consult on the following matters:

　　甲. Matters related to the conclusion of collective contracts and how to implement the provisions of collective contracts;

　　乙. Matters related to the study of production plans, the completion of production tasks, and the improvement of output and quality, and the saving of materials and tools;

　　丙. Matters related to improving production organization, such as labor allocation, machine and tool adjustment, and raw material allocation;

　　丁. Matters related to technological improvement, improvement of operating methods, improvement of production efficiency and workers' technical level;

　　戊. Matters related to the improvement of business and management and the formulation and modification of factory rules and reward and punishment systems;

　　己. Matters related to the employment and dismissal of employees, promotion and demotion of positions, and other personnel issues;

　　庚. Matters related to wages, working hours, living benefits, and other employee welfare facilities;

　　辛. Matters related to industrial and commercial enterprise safety and health and employee illness, injury, disability, and female worker maternity benefits.

　　IX. In the labor-management consultation meeting, both labor and management have the right to submit proposals through their respective representatives. When necessary, the chairman may notify the original proposer or relevant person in charge to attend the meeting and report.

　　X. The consultation procedure of the labor-management consultation meeting is as follows:

　　甲. The representatives of both labor and management shall notify the other party of the issues to be consulted before the meeting, so that the representatives of both parties can study in advance and solicit the opinions of relevant parties and employees;

　　乙. When the meeting is held, the chairman on duty shall submit the issues to the meeting for research and planning in the order agreed by both parties in order to reach an agreement;

　　丙. Agreements on general issues may be established after unanimous agreement by the representatives of both labor and management. Agreements on more important issues must be reported by the representatives of both parties to relevant personnel and all employees and can only be established after obtaining their consent;

　　丁. If there are any temporary proposals during the meeting, they must be submitted after the discussion of all items on the agenda and can only be discussed with the consent of both parties;

　　戊. All relatively important matters that have been agreed upon must be written into meeting minutes in triplicate, signed by the representatives of both parties, with each party holding one copy and the other copy sent to the local labor bureau for record.

　　XI. Matters that have been agreed upon shall be conveyed by the representatives of both labor and management to relevant personnel and employees respectively or jointly convened to convey and be responsible for implementation; matters that have not been agreed upon shall be discussed and consulted separately by both parties after the meeting in order to negotiate again at the next meeting.

　　XII. If a dispute arises during the meeting that cannot be resolved, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the labor dispute resolution procedure.

　　XIII. Agreements reached between labor and management shall not conflict with government laws and regulations and the provisions of collective contracts. If it is necessary to amend the collective contract, it must be handled in accordance with the procedure for signing the original collective contract.

　　XIV. After receiving these instructions, local labor bureaus should convene representatives of local trade union organizations and industrial and commercial groups to jointly discuss the methods for implementing these instructions, in order to gradually promote them with preparation and in a step-by-step manner under the conditions of consent and willingness of both labor and management, and report the implementation situation and experience to this Ministry at any time.
