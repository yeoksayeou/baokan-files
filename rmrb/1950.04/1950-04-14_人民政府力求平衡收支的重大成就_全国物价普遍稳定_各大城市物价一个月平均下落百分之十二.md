Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Since March, national prices have generally stabilized. This is a major achievement of the People's Government following the February National Financial Conference in its efforts to balance revenue and expenditure. Prices in major cities have fallen by an average of 12 percent in one month. Only Guangzhou saw an increase of 0.6 percent, while Xi'an experienced the largest drop, at 33 percent. Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou each saw declines of 9 to 12.9 percent.

Several encouraging characteristics clearly demonstrate that the price stability of the past month or so is fundamentally different from the temporary stability seen in May-June and September-October of last year.

Since March, the speed of currency circulation has greatly decreased. Calculated from the number of private bank draft exchanges in Tianjin, each yuan circulated as many as 52 times in January of this year, but only 8 times from March 1st to 20th. During the temporary price stability last year, the monthly circulation was no less than 22 to 26 times. For twelve years, people have been unwilling to keep money overnight, striving to purchase anything available, whether necessary or unnecessary, to avoid currency devaluation. This buying not for consumption created an abnormally active market and the possibility for speculators to hoard goods. Since March, due to the near balance of financial revenue and expenditure and the significant reduction in the deficit, the value of the currency has stabilized. People are now more willing to keep money in their pockets. Speculators have gradually lost the social basis for speculation, and have had to stop or reduce their speculative activities, and release some of their hoarded goods.

Currently, three situations have emerged in the market:

First, private commercial prices are generally lower than state-owned company prices. By March 24th, this phenomenon was almost universal across the country. For example, the listed price of 20-count yarn in Shanghai on that day was 6.15 million yuan, but the market price was 900,000 yuan lower. In Tianjin, the listed price of rice was 2,150 yuan per jin, but the market price was 100 yuan lower. In Beijing, on the 7th of this month, the listed price of Erchang Wufu cloth was 285,000 yuan per bolt, but the market price was 16,000 yuan lower. Recently, the gap between listed and market prices of grain in smaller cities such as Handan and Shijiazhuang has continued to widen. Due to speculators striving to sell their hoarded goods, the overall market price has fallen. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government is being extremely cautious in controlling listed prices to avoid excessively rapid and excessive price declines affecting legitimate industry and commerce.

Second, wholesale transactions have greatly decreased, while retail business within the necessary consumption volume remains active. This indicates that hoarding and reselling are no longer profitable, while consumers' needs and purchasing power remain the same. Shanghai has always been the largest cotton yarn speculation market in the country, and coupled with the bombing by the US-Chiang clique on February 6th, and the current peak season for yarn and cloth sales, prices would have inevitably risen steadily in the past. However, after rising in February this year, speculators have been seeking to sell their goods since March, but have not been able to, let alone continue to buy. Therefore, the state-owned Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company sold only two pieces of cotton yarn on the 3rd of this month, and sometimes could not even sell one piece. By the latter half of the 6th of this month, it turned to slightly buy in to prevent the market from falling too sharply. The situation is similar in terms of grain. The total wholesale volume in Shanghai in February was more than 470,000 dan, which decreased to more than 80,000 dan in March. However, the total retail volume directly purchased by consumers increased from a small few thousand dan per day in February to more than 10,000 dan.

Third, although the market is tight on credit, bank deposit and loan interest rates have gradually decreased. For example, the loan interest rate of private banks in Beijing was 66 to 69 percent at the end of February, which had dropped to 18 percent by March 29th. In the past, speculators did not hesitate to borrow money at high interest rates to engage in hoarding. In the past month or so, some of them have gone bankrupt because of these high interest rates, and some are increasingly approaching the verge of bankruptcy.

Because the speed and magnitude of price drops vary from place to place, some other abnormal phenomena have temporarily emerged. For example, the prices of some goods in the sales areas are lower than those in the production areas, or the difference between the two places is negligible, which is not enough to cover transportation costs; the price ratio of some finished products is lower than the price ratio of raw materials and semi-finished products, or the difference is negligible, which is not enough to cover production costs. These are also phenomena that are difficult to avoid immediately when starting to put the national economy on a sound track, and it requires a considerable period of arduous and careful work to adjust to normal.

### 人民政府力求平衡收支的重大成就  全国物价普遍稳定  各大城市物价一个月平均下落百分之十二

　　人民政府力求平衡收支的重大成就
    全国物价普遍稳定
    各大城市物价一个月平均下落百分之十二
    【新华社十三日讯】三月份以来全国物价普遍稳定，这是人民政府二月全国财政会议之后，力求平衡收支的重大成就。各大城市物价在一个月之内平均跌落了百分之十二，只有广州上升百分之零点六，西安下跌的幅度最大，为百分之三十三，天津、北京、上海、汉口各下跌百分之九至十二点九。
    许多可喜的特点明白显示这一个多月来的物价稳定和去年五六两月以及九十两月的暂时平稳有本质上的不同。
    三月以来，货币流通的速度大大地降低了。从天津私营行庄票据交换的次数中计算，今年一月内每一元人民币流通五十二次之多，三月一日至二十日仅流通八次，而去年物价暂时平稳时期每月还不下于二十二次至二十六次。十二年来人们不让货币在自己身边过夜，竭力购买任何只要可以买得到的不管是必需的或不必需的物资，以避免货币的贬值。这种不是为了消费的购买，造成了市场畸形的活跃，和投机商人囤积居奇的可能。三月以来，由于财政收支的接近平衡，赤字大大缩小，币值稳定了，人们就宁愿把货币摆在口袋里，投机商人逐渐丧失了进行投机的社会基础，不得不停止或缩小其投机活动，并且吐出其一部分囤积的物资。
    目前市场上出现了三种情况：
    第一是私营商业的货价普遍低于国营公司牌价。到三月二十四日这种现象几乎普遍全国，如当日上海二十支纱牌价六一五万元，市价低九十万元；天津大米牌价每斤二一五○元，市价低一百元；北京本月七日二厂五福布每匹牌价二十八万五千元，市价低一万六千元。最近，邯郸、石家庄等较小城市粮食牌市价的距离还在继续扩大。由于投机商人之力求脱售囤货，整个市场的价格下跌了。中央人民政府贸易部为了避免物价过快和过度的跌落影响到正当工商业，对牌价的掌握极为慎重。
    第二是批发交易大大减少，而在必需消费量以内的零售生意依然活跃。这表明囤积倒卖已无利可图，而消费者的需和要购买力如故。上海从来是全国最大的棉纱投机市场，加以二月六日美蒋的轰炸，现在又是纱布旺销的季节，若在过去，纱布价格必然步步看涨。但是，今年二月上涨之后，三月以来投机商人求吐尚不可得，更谈不到继续吞进。因此，国营上海花纱布公司本月三日仅卖出棉纱两件，有时甚至一件也卖不出去。至本月六日下旬乃转而略微收进，以防止市场跌势过猛。粮食方面的情形也是如此，二月上海批发成交总量为四十七万多担，三月减至八万多担，而由消费者直接购买的零售总量却由二月间每天很少的几千担增加到一万担以上。
    第三是市场银根虽紧而银行存放款利息反而逐渐降低。如北京二月底私营银行放款利率为百分之六六到六九，到三月二十九日已降到百分之十八。过去投机商人不惜高息借款以从事囤积，一个多月以来，他们有的已经因为这种高息而破产，有的日益接近破产的边沿。
    由于各地各种物价跌落的速度和幅度各不相同，暂时又产生了若干其他不正常的现象。如有些货物销地的价格反而低于产地，或者两地相差无几，以致不够运费；有些货物制成品的比价反而较原料与半制品的比价为低，或者相差无几，以致不够生产的成本。这也是在开始把全国经济纳入健全的轨道时难于立即避免的现象，必须经过相当长时间的艰苦的和谨慎的工作，才能调整正常。
