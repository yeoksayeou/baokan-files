　　Spring Plowing, Dike Repair, and Road Repair
    All Units of the Fourth Field Army Are Busy with Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 5th. The various units of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have plunged into a wave of production, actively engaged in spring plowing production and dike and road repair and other construction work.

    The XX units, which had just returned victoriously from the Guangxi front, immediately launched a production campaign upon arriving at their designated locations. One unit first formulated a production plan for the year, stipulating a target of 200 kilograms of grain production per person this year. Another unit, based on local conditions, stipulated that companies should focus on vegetable cultivation, regiments on transportation, and divisions and armies should closely cooperate with national economic construction by organizing manpower to engage in larger-scale construction projects such as river dredging, dike repair, and railway and highway construction. Another unit, returning victoriously from Sichuan to western Hubei, quickly accepted the arduous task of repairing the large dike on the east bank of the Han River, which had been damaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The dike stretches over 70 li from Jiukou Town in the south to Zhongxiang County in the north, and has historically been prone to flooding, constantly threatening the lives and property of five million people in the lower reaches of the Han River. After accepting this glorious task, the commanders and fighters cut timber, reeds, and wild grass from mountainous areas more than 200 li away, and built more than 2,000 thatched sheds to solve the housing problem. The commanders and fighters expressed their determination to strive for an early start under extremely difficult material conditions.
            Engaging in Various Production Activities According to Local Conditions to Strive for Self-Sufficiency
    The troops stationed in various parts of the Central South Region, tasked with suppressing bandits, are conducting various production activities according to local conditions, without hindering their primary tasks. A unit stationed in southwestern Jiangxi has obtained the consent of the government and mining authorities to engage in the mining and transportation of tungsten ore and the transport of public grain. From February 13th to February 23rd, one division cut 2.15 million catties of firewood, reclaimed 97 mu of wasteland, raised more than 600 pigs, and burned more than 300,000 catties of charcoal in ten days. The directly subordinate units of one division organized a production team of 754 people, contracted to repair water conservancy projects in Anfu County, completed the project in 14 days, and earned 90,000 catties of rice in wages. A unit engaged in bandit suppression in southern Hunan reclaimed 4,400 mu of wasteland from the beginning of the new year to the end of February, and has mostly planted vegetables and wheat; the directly subordinate units of the unit participated in coal transportation and earned more than 3.2 million yuan in wages, while also achieving self-sufficiency in firewood. A certain army stationed in Guangdong has also reclaimed 1,656 mu of wasteland, and plans to continue reclaiming 7,636 mu; many companies have achieved full self-sufficiency in firewood and vegetables, and their living conditions have improved significantly. In a certain unit in Dongjiang, in addition to the 1,800 mu of wasteland already reclaimed, another 6,000 mu can be reclaimed this spring; in addition, 140 mu of salt fields have been opened in coastal areas, and a new method is now being used for salt production, with an estimated output of 5 million catties of salt this year. In early February, a mortar company of a certain unit contracted to repair a 30-li highway in Zengcheng. At a speed of 1,500 meters repaired every eight hours, it was completed in eleven days, earning a total of 12,000 catties of rice in wages. Including the company's income from firewood cutting, pig raising, bean curd making, and vegetable cultivation, it earned 20 million yuan in addition to completing its public service tasks. The achievements of the mortar company greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of other units.

    The troops that revolted and were reorganized have also actively launched production and construction. One unit completed the earthwork for a 59,000+ cubic meter dike repair project in Fengbo Hill, Daye County, Hubei in seven days. The various units of one corps have also made plans, stipulating that production will focus on the mining of lead, iron, and coal, the construction of railways, and land reclamation, with the goal of achieving eight months of self-sufficiency in firewood and vegetables.

　　春耕·修堤·补路
    四野各部忙生产
    【新华社汉口五日电】人民解放军中南军区和第四野战军各部，已纷纷卷入生产热潮，积极进行春耕生产和修堤补路等建设工作。
    刚从广西前线胜利凯旋的某某两部，在到达指定驻地后，立即开展生产运动。某部首先订出本年生产计划，规定今年每人生产二百斤粮食的任务。另部则根据驻地情况，规定连以种菜为主，团以运输业为主，师、军则密切配合国家经济建设工作，组织人力从事开河修堤、修建铁路、公路等各种较大规模的建设工程。另由四川胜利凯旋鄂西的某部，也已迅速接受补修被国民党反动派损坏的汉水东岸大堤的艰巨任务。该堤南起旧口镇北至钟祥县，长达七十余华里，历年泛滥成灾，使汉水下游五百万人民生命财产经常遭受威胁。该部指战员接受这一光荣任务后，就在荒凉无人的堤岸旁边，从二百余里远的山地砍伐木料、芦苇、野草，建造了两千多个草棚，解决住屋问题。指战员们表示要在物质条件极为困难的情形下争取提早开工。
            根据驻地情况进行各种生产争取自给
    分驻中南区各地担任剿匪任务的部队，在不妨碍本身任务的原则下，根据驻地情况分别进行各种生产。驻防赣西南的某部现已取得政府和矿方的同意，进行开采和运输钨砂、包运公粮等工作。某师自二月十三日至二月二十三日止十天内，即砍柴二百一十五万斤，开荒九十七亩，养猪六百多口，烧炭三十余万斤。某师直属队组织了一个七五四人的生产队，包修安福县水利工程，十四天全部完成，得工资米九万斤。在湘南执行剿匪任务的某部，从新年开始至二月底止共开荒四千四百亩，并已大部种上蔬菜和小麦；该部直属队参加运煤得工资三百二十余万元，同时作到烧柴自给。驻防广东的某军也已开荒一千六百五十六亩，计划继续开辟七千六百三十六亩；许多连队作到全部柴菜自给，生活有了显著的改善。在东江某部，除已开荒一千八百亩外，今春尚可开荒六千亩；另在滨海地区开盐田一百四十亩，现正改用新法晒制，今年预计出产盐五百万斤。某部迫击炮连于二月上旬包修增城长三十华里的公路，以每八小时修筑一千五百米的速度，十一天即告完成，共得工资米一万二千斤，连同该连打柴、喂猪、开豆腐坊，种菜等项生产所得，除了完成交公任务外，还赚了二千万元。迫炮连的成就，大大地鼓舞了其他各部的生产热情。
    起义改编的各部队也积极展开生产建设，某部在七天中，完成了湖北大冶县风波岗五万九千多土方的修堤工程；某兵团各单位也已订好计划，规定以开采铅矿、铁矿、煤矿、修铁路、开荒等为生产范围，以完成八个月柴菜自给为目标。
