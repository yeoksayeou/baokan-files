Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: West German puppet government's "Chancellor" Adenauer publicly led the singing of the Nazi national anthem. According to Agence France-Presse, Berlin: Adenauer delivered a speech at the Titania Palace in the American sector of Berlin on the 18th. In addition to the puppet municipal heads of West Berlin, the commanders of the American, British, and French occupation forces in Berlin were also present. After the speech, Adenauer actually invited those present to sing the Nazi national anthem "Deutschland über alles." When the song began, the Social Democratic "Mayor" Reuter, the "Chairman of the City Council" Suhr, and others stood up.

After this incident occurred, the British occupation forces headquarters issued a communique stating that British General Bourne had expressed his opinion, and therefore, "there is no intention to take further action." American Commander Taylor simply "had no statement to issue."

This incident is a reflection of the current fascization of West Germany. Afterwards, when the West German pseudo-government's Federal Minister of Unification Kaiser explained the matter, he said: "This was bound to happen sooner or later, because this section of the former German national anthem (i.e., the Nazi national anthem) is often sung after meetings in West Germany."

　　西德“总理”阿登纳公开领唱纳粹国歌
    美英法占领当局充耳不闻
    【新华社二十四日讯】西德傀儡政府的“总理”阿登纳，公开领唱纳粹国歌。据法新社柏林讯：阿登纳于十八日在柏林美占区的蒂坦尼亚宫发表了一篇演说。到场听讲的，除了西柏林傀儡市政首脑之外，还有柏林美英法三国占领军司令。阿登纳在演说之后，居然请到会者唱纳粹国歌“德意志至上”。歌声起时，社会民主党的“市长”鲁特尔，“市议会主席”苏尔等均起立。
    这一事件发生之后，英国占领军司令部发表了一个公报，说英方鲍恩将军已表示了意见，因此，“无采取进一步行动的意向”。美方司令泰勒则干脆“没有什么声明发表”。
    这一事件乃是目前西德法西斯化情况的一种反映。在事后，当西德伪政府联邦统一部长凯撒解释这件事说：“这件事迟早总要发生的，因为前德国国歌（按即纳粹国歌）的这一节，在西德开会后是常常唱的”。
