    The 45th issue of "Beijing Youth" was published on the 24th. To commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement, it published Hu Hua's "Who Led the 'May Fourth' Movement?" and Chen Qi's "Comrade Li Dazhao and the 'May Fourth' Movement." This issue published an editorial entitled "Strive to Do a Good Job in League Classes," pointing out that League classes are a very important task in the current construction of the League. In addition, there are two reference materials for League class study. The journal has newly opened a column "Youth Lectures" with Hu Sheng's "On the Question of Ideological Method" and Huang Di's "Equality and Mutual Benefit." The "League Life" column contains three articles including "No. 2 Middle School Combines Music Class to Improve Singing Activities."

    The 40th issue of "Beijing Young Children" (published on the 26th) briefly introduced the activities of representatives attending the National Conference of Cadres for Children's Work. The newly opened "Team Life" column introduced the model story of Cao Xiuquan, a member of the Eleventh District Central Primary School team. "Fire" is a translated story: it tells how a child caused a fire because of his naughtiness, but bravely rescued his younger brother in the fire. In addition to "Scientific Questions and Answers," the popular science section also selected an article "How is Pollen Spread?" explaining the medium and situation of pollen transmission. In the children's articles, they talked about mutual assistance and friendship, labor, and the joy of hearing about the landing on Hainan Island.
