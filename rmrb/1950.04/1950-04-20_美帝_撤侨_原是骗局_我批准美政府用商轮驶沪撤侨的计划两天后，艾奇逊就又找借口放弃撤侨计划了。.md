Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: US Secretary of State Acheson, who for more than three months had been loudly clamoring to withdraw all US "official personnel" and other nationals from China, suddenly changed his tune on the 12th of this month. In a statement issued in Washington, he claimed that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits "could no longer delay laying mines in the northern waterway" and announced that "all plans for evacuation from Shanghai by sea have been abandoned." Acheson's statement was issued just two days after the Shanghai Municipal People's Government approved in writing the US government's plan to use British merchant ships to evacuate nationals from Shanghai. This fact clearly indicates that the US government has no sincerity in evacuating nationals; its so-called "evacuation" plan is nothing more than a hoax.

The truth about the US government's "evacuation" from China is as follows:

On January 15th of this year, the US government, citing the Beijing Military Control Commission's recovery of the US barracks property, claimed to have ordered the recall of all US official personnel stationed in China. More than three months have passed since then, but only a small portion of the former US consulate personnel stationed in China have left. Another large portion (mainly from Shanghai and Nanjing) have been saying every day that they will leave China, but have not yet left.

In February and March of this year, the US government wanted the American President Lines to use landing craft to transport former US consulate personnel and other nationals in Shanghai to the American ship Gordon. Considering that the landing craft were military vessels in nature, our Shanghai authorities did not agree to the company's request. However, the company unilaterally announced the date of the landing craft's arrival in Shanghai, vigorously soliciting passengers and selling tickets, causing great losses to ordinary passengers.

Later, the US government reached an agreement with the British company Butterfield & Swire to use its Anqing ship to evacuate nationals from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Butterfield & Swire applied to our Shanghai Municipal People's Government for permission for the Anqing ship to come to Shanghai on April 7th. Our Shanghai Municipal People's Government immediately verbally expressed its agreement, and on April 10th, it gave the company written approval. However, on April 12th, US Secretary of State Acheson suddenly announced the cancellation of the Anqing ship's plan to evacuate nationals to Shanghai, citing the issue of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits laying mines. In order to shirk responsibility, Acheson even distorted the facts, insisting that "the Chinese Communists have not yet permitted ships to evacuate nationals from Shanghai."

In fact, our government's attitude towards the US government's evacuation of its former consulate personnel stationed in China has always been that those who wish to leave are not detained. All former US consulate personnel who apply to leave the country and ordinary American nationals who request to return home are quickly granted permission to leave. They can leave from Shanghai or transit through other seaports, allowing them to leave freely. China's door is always open and continues to be open.

Contrary to our government's attitude, the US government has been playing the trick of "evacuation" for more than three months. Facts have repeatedly proven that the real purpose of the US government is to create an extremely false atmosphere that the Chinese People's Government is oppressing American nationals and not allowing them to return home. It can be believed that this shameless deception by the US government can only arouse the contempt of the Chinese people and the anger of the American people.

　　美帝“撤侨”原是骗局
    我批准美政府用商轮驶沪撤侨的计划两天后，艾奇逊就又找借口放弃撤侨计划了。
    【新华社十九日讯】三个多月来一直大声喧嚷着要从中国撤退美国一切“官方人员”及其他侨民的美国国务卿艾奇逊，在本月十二日突然改变声调，在华盛顿发表了一个声明，借口蒋匪“不能再延迟北水道的布雷”，宣布“由海路自上海撤侨的所有计划都已予以放弃”。艾奇逊的这个声明恰恰是发表在我上海市人民政府书面批准美国政府使用英商轮船来沪撤侨的计划的两天之后。这一事实清楚地指明了美国政府并无诚意撤侨，它的所谓“撤侨”计划不过是一种骗局。
    美国政府自中国“撤侨”一事经过的真象如下：
    美国政府在今年一月十五日借口我国北京军事管制委员会收回美国兵营地产一事，声称下令召回美国驻我国的一切官方人员。自那时以来，时间已过了三个多月，但至今却只有一小部分美国驻我国的前领馆人员撤走，另有很大一部分（主要是上海、南京方面的），天天说要离开中国，至今还没有离开。
    今年二三月间，美国政府要美国总统轮船公司用登陆艇来沪摆运美国前驻沪领事馆人员及其他侨民至美轮戈登号上，我上海当局鉴于登陆艇系军用舰艇性质，对于该公司的要求未予同意。但该公司竟擅自宣布登陆艇来沪日期，大肆招揽旅客，兜售船票，致使一般旅客遭受很大损失。
    后来，美国政府又商得英商太古轮船公司同意，用该公司的安庆轮自港来沪撤侨。太古轮船公司于四月七日向我上海市人民政府申请对安庆轮来沪的许可。我上海市人民政府当即口头表示同意，四月十日又给该公司以书面批准。但四月十二日，美国国务卿艾奇逊却突然借口蒋匪布雷问题，宣布取消安庆轮来沪撤侨的计划。艾奇逊为了推卸责任，竟颠倒黑白，硬说“中共还没有许可船只自上海撤侨。”
    事实上我国政府对于美国政府撤退其驻我国的前领事馆人员的态度，从来是愿去者不留。凡申请离境的美国前领事馆人员和要求回国的一般美侨，都被迅速给予离境的许可。他们可以从上海出口，也可以转道其他海口出口，让他们自由离开，中国的门是随时敞开着并且是继续敞开着的。
    与我国政府的态度相反，美国政府三个多月以来却只是玩弄着“撤侨”的骗术。事实已迭次证明美国政府的真正目的，是在制造其所谓中国人民政府压迫美侨并不许美侨回国的极端虚伪的空气。可以相信，美国政府的这种无耻的欺骗，只能引起中国人民的鄙视和美国人民的愤怒。
