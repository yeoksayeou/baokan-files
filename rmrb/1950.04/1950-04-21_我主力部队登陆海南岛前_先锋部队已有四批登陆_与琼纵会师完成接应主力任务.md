[Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 20th] Frontline reporter reports: Before the main force of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army crossed the sea and landed on Hainan Island, the vanguard troops of this unit had crossed the sea in four batches to fight, successfully landing on Hainan Island, meeting with the Qiongya Column, and completing the task of receiving the main force.

After the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army completely liberated the Leizhou Peninsula in early December of last year, it immediately launched large-scale naval training, awaiting orders to cross the sea and liberate Hainan Island. After two or three months of nautical exercises and combat exercises, overcoming various difficulties in material conditions, and becoming familiar with ship handling techniques and combat actions at sea, they launched four batches of strong crossings to land on Hainan Island between March 5th and April 1st.

At 7:00 PM on March 5th, the first batch of vanguard troops departed from the southern part of the Leizhou Peninsula and launched a stealthy raid on the west coast of Hainan Island. After 19 hours of sailing, they landed in Baimajing, Dan County, at 2:00 PM on the 6th. During the landing, six enemy planes took turns bombing and strafing our army, and two companies of coastal defenders also put up stubborn resistance. Our army fought bravely, destroyed enemy coastal fortifications, defeated the enemy's stubborn resistance, and continued to advance victoriously. A part of the Qiongya Column also advanced to the southeast of Paiqia City on the 4th to contain the enemy in that area and support the landing of the seaborne vanguard troops. Our landing troops then victoriously met with a part of the Qiongya Column. At the same time, a certain unit of our army, which was strongly stationed in Beihai, Guangdong, also crossed the sea in two routes at 7:00 PM on the 6th and landed on Weizhou Island. After seven hours of battle, they completely liberated Weizhou Island at 2:00 AM on the 7th.

The second batch of seaborne vanguard troops departed from the eastern part of the Leizhou Peninsula at 13:00 on March 10th, sailing 350 li and after 26 hours, forcibly landed north of Chishui Port, Wenchang County, in eastern Hainan Island at 2:00 PM the next day. After defeating the resistance of bandit troops along the way, the landing troops met with a part of the Qiongya Column. At this point, both the left and right wings of the remnant bandits in northern Hainan Island were broken through by our army.

The third batch of seaborne troops set off from the western part of the Leizhou Peninsula at 7:00 PM on March 26th, heading towards the front of Hainan Island for landing. They successfully landed on the Yupaogang and Leigong Island line in Lingao County at 7:30 AM the next day and met with a part of the Qiongya Column on the 29th.

After the successful landing of the third batch, the fourth batch of seaborne forces was even stronger. This batch of landing troops set sail from the eastern part of the Leizhou Peninsula at 0:30 on the night of March 31st, heading straight for the vicinity of Haikou. En route, they encountered three enemy ships attempting to intercept them. The deputy company commander of the 9th Company of a certain unit led three sailboats to charge towards the enemy ships from the flanks, launching a naval battle, repelling the enemy ships, and completing the task of covering the landing of subsequent troops. At 4:00 AM on April 1st, with the assistance of the Qiongya Column and the advance landing troops, the unit landed on the more than ten-li coastline between Wan'gang and Xinxijiao northeast of Haikou. At this point, the 400-li sea defense line on the west, east, and north sides of the remnant bandits on Hainan Island was broken through by our army.

After our army successfully landed, the remnant bandits attempted to launch an attack while we had not yet gained a firm foothold. The 1st Regiment of the Bandit Training 2nd Division blocked us on the Tashih (east of Qiongshan) to Maide line. After a short period of fighting, our army defeated them, annihilating their regimental headquarters, two infantry companies, and one machine gun company. The bandits then used the 38th Regiment of the Temporary 13th Division to conduct a second line of defense between Sanjiang (north of Wenchang) and Tiaopo, but they were also quickly defeated by our army. Our army took advantage of the victory to advance towards the hinterland. On the 5th, the main force of the Bandit 255th Division launched a three-pronged attack on our army near Zhongruishi. After only one hour of battle, the enemy collapsed across the board. As of April 5th, our army had annihilated one regimental headquarters, three battalions, and two companies, totaling 1,100 bandits captured after landing.

In the battles during the crossing and after landing, the morale of our army was extremely high. The boatmen who participated in the navigation were also extremely brave, not flinching in naval battles. When the troops landed, they advanced with the army, and some requested to be issued guns to participate in the battle. The remnant bandits, on the other hand, were demoralized, and fled in disarray after only a little resistance. The enemy defenders in Haikou hastily destroyed the airport, and the bandit Hainan Island Defense Headquarters and the bandit leader Xue Yue had fled to Wenchang.

　　我主力部队登陆海南岛前
    先锋部队已有四批登陆
    与琼纵会师完成接应主力任务
    【新华社海南前线二十日电】前线记者报道：人民解放军第四野战军渡海部队主力登陆海南岛前，该部先锋部队曾四批渡海作战，胜利登陆海南岛，与琼崖纵队会师，完成接应主力部队登陆任务。
    人民解放军第四野战军某部于去年十二月上旬全部解放雷州半岛后，即展开了大规模的海上练兵，待命渡海解放海南岛。经过两三个月的航海演习和战斗演习，克服了物质条件上的各种困难，熟悉了操船技术与海上的战斗动作，即于三月五日至四月一日间分四批强渡登陆海南岛作战。
    三月五日下午七时，第一批先锋部队从雷州半岛南部出发，向海南岛西岸进行潜渡强袭，经十九小时航行，至第二日下午二时，在儋县白马井登陆。登陆时，敌机六架对我军轮番轰炸、扫射，海岸守敌两个连亦进行顽抗。我军奋勇作战，摧毁敌海岸工事后，击溃敌人顽抗，乘胜继续挺进。琼崖纵队之一部，亦于四日进抵排洽市之东南，牵制该地敌人，支援渡海先锋部队登陆。我登陆部队随即与琼崖纵队的一部胜利会师。与此同时，雄踞广东北海之我军某部亦于六日下午七时分两路渡海在涠州岛登陆，经七小时战斗，至七日晨二时全部解放涠州岛。
    第二批渡海先锋部队，于三月十日十三时由雷州半岛东部出发，航行三百五十里，经过二十六小时，至次日下午二时，在海南岛东部文昌县赤水港以北强行登陆。登陆部队击溃沿途匪军抵抗后，即与琼崖纵队的一部会师。至此，海南岛北部残匪左右两翼均被我军突破。
    第三批渡海部队，于三月二十六日晚七时，由雷州半岛西部开始出发，向海南岛正面登陆，于次日晨七时半在临高县玉泡港、雷公岛一线登陆成功，二十九日与琼崖纵队一部会师。
    第三批登陆成功后，第四批渡海的兵力更为强大。此批登陆部队于三月三十一日夜十二时半自雷州半岛东部启航，直驶海口附近，中途曾遇敌舰三艘阻击。某部九连副连长率三只帆船由侧翼向敌舰冲去，展开炮战，击退敌舰，完成掩护后续部队登陆的任务。四月一日晨四时，在琼崖纵队和先遣登陆部队接应下，该部在海口以东北湾港与新溪角间十余里海岸线上登陆。至此，海南岛残匪西、东、北三面四百里海防线均为我军突破。
    我军登陆成功后，残匪企图乘我立足未稳时发动攻击。匪教导第二师第一团在塔市（在琼山以东）至迈德一线阻击。经短时间战斗后，我军即将其击溃，歼其团部及两个步兵连、一个机枪连。匪又以暂十三师之三十八团在三江（在文昌以北）至挑坡间，进行第二线阻击，亦被我军迅速击溃。我军乘胜向腹地挺进。五日，匪二五五师主力分三路向我军合击，在钟瑞市附近展开战斗，仅经一小时，敌即全线溃退。截至四月五日，我军登陆后已歼敌一个团部，三个营、两个连，共歼俘匪一千一百名。
    在渡海中和登陆后的战斗中，我军士气极为旺盛。参加航海的船工亦极英勇，在海战中毫不畏缩，部队登陆时随军推进，有的要求发给枪械参加战斗。残匪则军心涣散，稍作抵抗即行溃逃。海口守敌仓惶将机场破坏，匪海南岛防卫总部及匪首薛岳已逃往文昌。
