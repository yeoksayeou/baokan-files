　　Does Urban Tax Revenue Rank First?
    Answer to the Yanqing Tax Office Study Group

To the Editor:
    We are studying the March 22nd editorial in your newspaper, "The Role of Taxation in Our National Work." Paragraph eight of this article states: "Urban tax revenue has been raised to the first place in revenue, accounting for 40.1 percent of the total revenue; agricultural tax has been reduced to second place, accounting for only 37.2 percent of the total revenue."
    However, in our study of Tax Work Research, Issue 24, "Minister Bo Yibo's Report on the Draft Budget of National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure for 1950," Section B, Article 1, states: "Grain income still ranks first, accounting for 41.4 percent of the total income," and Article 2 states: "Various taxes account for 38.9 percent of the estimated income, ranking second in income." Comparing and studying these two documents reveals a discrepancy. We kindly request an explanation.

To the Yanqing Tax Office Study Group:
    In Minister Bo Yibo's "Report on the Compilation of the Draft National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget for 1950," delivered on December 2, 1949, at the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Section B, Article 1, states: "Grain income still ranks first in income, accounting for approximately 41.4 percent of the total income." and Section B, Article 2, states: "Various taxes account for 38.9 percent of the estimated income, ranking second in income." The changes in the aforementioned proportions compared to what was said in the March 22nd People's Daily editorial "The Role of Taxation in Our National Work," which stated: "Urban tax revenue has been raised to the first place in revenue, accounting for 40.1 percent of the total revenue; agricultural tax has been reduced to second place, accounting for only 37.2 percent of the total revenue," is because the fiscal and taxation work has been rectified since the previous budget estimates were published. After the precise calculations made at the National Fiscal Conference this February, the proportions of urban tax revenue and grain income were determined. Therefore, the proportions of urban tax revenue and grain income have changed. Regarding this point, the article "The Role of Taxation in Our National Work" already provided a clear indication. Paragraph eight of the article states: "In fact, the situation of national fiscal revenue in 1949 has already undergone significant changes in the proportion of various revenues, that is to say, urban tax revenue has increased compared to the past. After precise calculations made at the National Fiscal Conference this February, the proportion of various revenues in the 1950 revenue and expenditure budget approved by the Central People's Government Committee last December has also changed. Urban tax revenue has been raised to the first place in revenue, accounting for 40.1 percent of the total revenue; agricultural tax has been reduced to second place, accounting for only 37.2 percent of the total revenue; state-owned enterprise income has risen to third place, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total revenue; other income accounts for 4.8 percent."
    Why is there such a change? That is to say, why can urban tax revenue be raised to the first place in revenue? The article "The Role of Taxation in Our National Work" also provides a detailed explanation on this point. Paragraph seven of the article states: "First, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang before the War of Resistance Against Japan, its income mainly relied on customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, with annual revenue regularly exceeding 800 million silver dollars. Now, the country has been basically unified, the war on the mainland has basically ended, and urban industry and commerce are gradually recovering, greatly increasing the tax base compared to the past rural period. Therefore, it is entirely possible and entirely appropriate to gradually collect these taxes. Second, the urban taxes during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang mostly fell on small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators, with a large number of taxpayers and low income, while the largest industrial and commercial enterprises, such as the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen, did not pay any taxes. Today, this phenomenon has completely changed. Our burden policy is fair and reasonable, and current taxpayers include not only small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households, but also large industrial and commercial households and state-owned enterprises, which enables the people's government to exceed the Kuomintang in this aspect of the tax base. Third, under the management of the people's government, the phenomenon of corruption and embezzlement in tax collection work can be greatly reduced or even completely eliminated, and the vast majority or even all of the tax revenue can be put into the national treasury. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, tax officials rarely avoided corruption and embezzlement. This is another important condition for us to have more tax revenue."

### 城市税收是否占第一位？  答延庆税务所学习组问

　　城市税收是否占第一位？
    答延庆税务所学习组问编辑同志：
    我们学习三月二十二日贵报社论《税收在我们国家工作中的作用》，此文第八段上说：“城市税收已提到岁入的第一位，占岁入百分之四十点一；农业税已降为第二位，仅占岁入的百分之三十七点二”。
    但我们在学习税工研究第二十四期“薄一波部长关于一九五○年度全国财政收支概算草案编成的报告”时，其乙项一条，“公粮收入仍占第一位，占全部收入的百分之四十一点四”，二条“各项税收占收入概算的百分之三十八点九，是收入的第二位”。两文件比较研究是有出入的，敬请解答。
                                          延庆税务所学习组延庆税务所学习组：
    一九四九年十二月二日，薄一波部长在中央人民政府委员会第四次委员会议上所作：“关于一九五○年度全国财政收支草案编成的报告”，其中乙项一条“公粮收入仍占收入第一位，占全部收入的约占百分之四十一点四”。及乙项二条“各项税收占收入概算的百分之三十八点九，是收入的第二位。”与三月二十二日本报社论《税收在我们国家工作中的作用”一文所说：“城市税收已提到岁入的第一位，占岁入百分之四十点一，农业税已降低到第二位，仅占岁入的百分之三十七点二”。这前后比例数字的变化，是因为前次的概算发表以后，财政税收工作已有整顿。经过今年二月全国财政会议精确计算后，城市税收与公粮收入的比例才确定下来，因此城市税收入和公粮收入两者的比例便发生了变化。关于这一点，《税收在我们国家工作中的作用》一文中已有明白的提示，该文第八段说：“事实上，一九四九年的全国财政收入情况，在各项岁入的比重上，已经发生了重要的变化，就是说，城市税收已经比过去增加了。经过今年二月全国财政会议精确计算后，去年十二月中央人民政府委员会通过的一九五○年度收支概算中关于各项岁入的比重也已经变化了。城市税收已提到岁入的第一位，占岁入百分之四十点一；农业税已降为第二位，仅占岁入百分之三十七点二；国营企业收入升到第三位，占岁入的百分之十七点九；其他收入为百分之四点八。”
    为什么有这种变化呢？就是说为什么可以将城市税收提到岁收的第一位呢？这一点《税收在我们国家工作中的作用》一文也有详细的说明，该文第七段说“第一，抗战前国民党反动统治时代，其收入主要是依靠关、盐、统三税，每年入库经常在八亿银元以上。现在全国已经基本上统一，大陆上的战争已经基本结束，城市工商业逐渐恢复起来，比过去农村时期的税源大大增加，因此把这些税收逐步收齐是完全可能的，也是完全应该的。其次，国民党反动统治时代的城市税收，大都是落到中小工商业者身上，纳税户的数量多、收入少，而最大的工商企业例如蒋宋孔陈四大家族，就不缴纳任何税款。今天这种现象是完全改变了。我们的负担政策是公平合理的，现在的纳税者不仅有中小工商业户，而且有大工商业户和国营企业，这就使人民政府的税源在这一方面超过国民党。第三，人民政府管理下的税收工作，贪污中饱现象一定可以大大减少以至于根本肃清，税收的绝大部分以至全部可以归入国库，而国民党反动统治时代，税收机关人员则是很少不贪污中饱的。这是我们有更多税收收入的另一个重要条件。”                          编者
