Xinhua News Agency report: The National Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee issued a notice on the 28th of last month regarding several specific regulations on clearing and allocating warehouse materials. The full text is as follows:

	A. Organization

One, Each major administrative region should immediately establish a Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Branch (hereinafter referred to as "Branch"), with the director or deputy director or secretary-general of the local Financial and Economic Committee concurrently serving as the director of the Branch, and the chief of the logistics department of the local field army concurrently serving as the deputy director.

Two, The Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Fuel Industry, Ministry of Textile Industry, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (in conjunction with the Third Bureau of the Military Commission), People's Bank, General Administration of Customs, and the Health Department of the Military Commission of the Central People's Government should all establish their respective Warehouse Clearing and Allocation Branches (also referred to as "Branch"), with the minister or deputy minister concurrently serving as the director of the Branch, and the person in charge of the materials department concurrently serving as the deputy director. Other departments under the Financial and Economic Committee may also establish Branches at their discretion.

Three, Each Branch is directly under the leadership of the National Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee (hereinafter referred to as "General Committee"), and may establish sub-branches and clearing groups under each Branch as needed by provinces, cities, or enterprises. Each Branch should submit a written report to the General Committee every ten days, and important events should be reported at any time.

Four, The General Committee may organize work teams and send them to various regions to assist in warehouse clearing work. The work teams may participate in the work of the Branches and may inspect any warehouse and the work of the Branches and the sub-branches and groups under each Branch.

	B. Clearing and Reporting

Five, Warehouses taken over in each region (non-production units) should immediately stop transfers, conduct clearing, and submit a register (as in Form 1). Except for East China, which should report the balance as of March 31, other regions should report the original number of takeovers in four copies, keeping one copy for themselves and submitting three copies to the Branch, which will forward two copies to the General Committee. Materials that have been allocated before the promulgation of the State Council's decision on warehouse material clearing and allocation should also be reported to the General Committee level by level.

Six, Warehouses belonging to each enterprise department should be cleared by the enterprises themselves, and each department Branch should send personnel to supervise and inspect. First, raw materials and machinery should be cleared and reported according to Forms 2 and 3 (to be reported by the end of June). Real estate and other assets should be reported separately (to be completed by the end of July). All figures filled in should be the actual inventory as of May 31. Four copies of the inventory should be submitted, one copy for self-retention, one copy for the主管 enterprise, one copy for each department Branch, and one copy for the General Committee. During the inventory, no transfer or allocation is allowed except for production necessities.

Seven, If, during the clearing process, each department Branch discovers that warehouses of affiliated enterprises contain large quantities of important materials that are not needed by the enterprise, it should immediately report to the General Committee for timely allocation.

Eight, Each regional Branch should report the revenue and expenditure of each affiliated warehouse on a monthly basis (with Form 4 attached). Each department Branch should selectively report the monthly revenue and expenditure (the main material items that must be reported monthly shall be determined by each department and reported to the General Committee for record by April 30).

Nine, The materials in each form shall be uniformly numbered and issued by the General Committee. Before issuance, the unit's own number can be filled in first, which will be formulated by each Branch (or sub-branch). The unit of measurement shall be in the metric system, which shall also be stipulated and issued by the General Committee.

Ten, Materials should be valued and reported immediately after clearing. The valuation method will be determined separately. (Attached)

	C. Allocation and Sale

Eleven, The right to allocate materials from warehouses taken over in each region belongs to the General Committee (the military system is responsible by the Logistics Department of the Military Commission), and each branch shall not allocate. Those who have been allocated in each region before the announcement of the State Council's decision on warehouse material clearing and allocation may be re-allocated by the General Committee after reporting to the General Committee.

Twelve, Materials from each takeover warehouse will be allocated uniformly by the central government. After approval by the Central Financial and Economic Committee, the department in need will handle financial procedures through the Central Ministry of Finance and issue a payment notice. After receiving the payment notice from the Ministry of Finance, the local Branches should immediately allocate the materials. In order to facilitate allocation, the Ministry of Finance has sent special personnel to Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guilin (under the leadership of the General Committee's work team) to handle valuation and allocation procedures.

Thirteen, The amount of raw materials that should be retained in the warehouses of each production enterprise is temporarily stipulated as follows:

	1. The amount of raw materials used for production and daily repairs should generally not exceed three months of usage, calculated by department. If special circumstances require exceeding this amount, the reasons should be explained (filled in the remarks column).
	2. The amount of building materials should not exceed six months of usage.
	3. The amount of materials for engineering should not exceed six months of the budgeted amount for the project.

All materials exceeding the above regulations should be classified as surplus materials and included in the national income (if the investor has already valued and reported, the Ministry of Finance will record it as recovered funds during allocation) and allocated according to Article 12.

Fourteen, All military supplies, such as ammunition, ordnance, and ready-made equipment, shall be allocated by the military system. However, raw materials that can be used to manufacture military supplies are not subject to this restriction.

Fifteen, Materials that have been allocated to the trade department for sale in each region and materials taken over by the trade department that have not been sold and have not been mixed with the company's commodities shall be agreed upon in contracts by the Central Ministry of Finance and the respective trade companies for phased sales, and all income shall be turned over to the state treasury and shall not be used as trade recovery.

Sixteen, Non-industrial materials that are not suitable for trade sales may be discussed and decided by the work team and the local Branch and handed over to the Central Ministry of Finance to organize an auction house to sell them locally.

Seventeen, The price of material allocation shall be negotiated and determined by the user department and the Central Ministry of Finance, and the price listed in the report is for reference only.

	D. Storage and Repair

Eighteen, The Branches and the original takeover units are responsible for storing and regularly inspecting all warehouse materials to prevent damage. If there is any loss, the cause should be identified and reported to the General Committee level by level.

Nineteen, For materials in the takeover warehouses that need to be repaired, each local Branch should submit a plan and cost budget, which shall be submitted to the General Committee for verification and then forwarded to the Central Financial and Economic Committee for approval before implementation.

Twenty, Defective machines in the takeover warehouses should be repaired locally as much as possible. Only when the repair is completed and it is usable can it be allocated. If the user department urgently needs it and can repair it itself, it can be allocated at a reduced price.
