Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th dispatch from TASS: The 12th National Congress of the French Communist Party continued its session on the morning of the 4th. Amidst thunderous applause and the singing of the Internationale, the congress passed a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. The telegram stated: The French Communists attending the 12th National Congress express their love for the Bolshevik Party, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, and Comrade Stalin. They recall that France was liberated first and foremost through the efforts of the various peoples of the Soviet Union and the Soviet army. They know that every step the Soviet Union takes towards communism is a step forward for France and the entire world towards the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism. In the face of warmongers, the socialist homeland represents hope and embodies life. Therefore, the slogan of our Party's Political Bureau, "The French People Will Never Fight the Soviet Union," has become the oath of millions of French men and women.
    The telegram continued: We are fighting and will continue to fight to strengthen the unity of the working class, strengthen the alliance of workers and toiling peasants, and unite all democratic forces in the country to defend the fundamental interests of the working people, to restore France's national independence, and to ensure the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism. We reaffirm our determination to continue the struggle bravely to stop the imperialist war in Vietnam. We will actively support the German Democratic Republic, which is laying the foundation for unified democracy and peace.
    The telegram concluded: Consolidating and developing the Party is a prerequisite for victory. We guarantee that in the future, under the leadership of Thorez, we will build our Party into a Leninist-Stalinist party.
    Long live the Bolshevik Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee!
    Long live the great Comrade Stalin!
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 6th dispatch from TASS: The 12th Congress of the French Communist Party continued its session on the afternoon of the 5th. Secretary Duclos delivered a lengthy speech. Representatives from French overseas territories addressed the congress, emphasizing the growth of national liberation movements and peace movements. Communist Party representatives from Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and other places particularly pointed out the heroic actions of dockworkers in various African Mediterranean ports who refused to load and unload war materials. Speakers all expressed their firm conviction that with the support of the French working class, the people of overseas territories will surely prevent French territories in Africa from becoming a springboard for US imperialism to prepare for war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Gordot, the spokesperson for the Credentials Committee, announced that a total of 903 delegates were participating in the congress, including 707 men and 196 women. According to the Credentials Committee's materials, among the delegates, 266 joined the party before 1940, 145 joined between 1940 and 1944, 380 joined between 1944 and 1947, and 84 joined between 1947 and 1950.

　　法共十二届代表大会
    电联共和斯大林致敬         
    “法兰西人民决不对苏联作战”的口号已变成了千百万男女的庄严誓词
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社巴黎六日讯：法国共产党十二届代表大会四日晨继续开会。大会在暴风雨般的掌声和国际歌歌声中，通过了致苏联共产党中央委员会和斯大林同志的致敬电。电文称：出席第十二届全国代表大会的法国共产党人，表示他们对布尔什维克党，布尔什维克党中央委员会和斯大林同志的热爱。他们回想，法国国土首先第一是由于苏联各族人民和苏联军队的努力而解放的。他们知道，苏联每向共产主义迈进一步，也就是法国和全世界向着和平、民主及社会主义三者的胜利迈进了一步。在战争贩子们面前，社会主义的国土就代表着希望，体现着生命。因此，我党政治局关于“法兰西人民决不对苏联作战”的口号，已变成了千百万法国男女的誓言。
    电文继称：我们正在战斗并将继续战斗，以加强工人阶级的团结，加强工人与劳苦农民的联盟，和团结全国一切民主力量，来保卫劳动人民的根本利益，来恢复法国的国家独立，来确保和平、民主和社会主义三者的胜利。我们重申我们的决心：勇敢地继续斗争，以制止越南的帝国主义战争。我们将积极地支持正在给统一民主和爱好和平打下基础的德意志民主共和国。
    电文最后称：巩固和发展党，是胜利的先决条件。我们保证今后要在多列士的领导下，把我党建设成为列宁、斯大林式的党。
    苏联的布尔什维克党及其中央委员会万岁！
    伟大的斯大林同志万岁！
