　　Xingtai Special District Three Hundred Cadres
　　Go to the Countryside to Carry Out a Sowing Campaign

　　[Our Newspaper] The Xingtai Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Hebei and the Xingtai Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have drawn 260 cadres from various units directly under them to form a work group to go deep into the countryside to specifically help the masses carry out the sowing campaign. On April 6, the special district held a cadre mobilization meeting, attended by more than 1,300 people. Deputy Commissioner Liu made a report entitled "Spring Plowing is the Overriding Central Task." Cheng Yulin, Secretary of the Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out: We should accept the painful lesson of last year's late start, which affected increased production. This time, we are not going down for inspection, but to specifically help organize the masses to participate in various production activities, mobilize the masses to hoe wheat and water wheat, and eliminate pests such as fire spiders and locust nymphs. Patiently educate the masses to break the conservative idea of self-sufficiency. The cadres discussed and studied the reports and documents on the 7th and 8th, and on the 10th, they cooperated with 50 people from the provincial work group, a total of 310 people, to go down together. This time, the focus is on helping Ningjin and Baixiang, the cotton-producing areas of paddy fields, and Weixian and Nangong, the cotton-producing areas of dry land. The time limit is one month to one and a half months.

　　邢台专区三百干部
　　下乡开展播种运动
    【本报讯】河北邢台专署及中共邢台地委，抽调直属机关各单位干部二百六十人，组为工作团，深入到农村具体帮助群众开展播种运动。四月六日，专区召开干部动员大会，计到一千三百余人。刘副专员以春耕工作是压倒一切的中心任务为题作了报告。中共地委书记程玉琳指出：应接受去年因动手太晚致影响增产的惨痛教训。这次下去，不是为检查而检查，要具体帮助组织群众参加各种生产活动，发动群众锄麦、浇麦，扑灭火蜘蛛、蝗蝻等害虫。耐心教育群众打破自给自足的保守思想。各干部于七、八两日将报告和文件进行了讨论学习，于十日配合省工作团五十个人，共三百一十人一同下去。这次重点帮助以宁晋、柏乡水田产棉区和威县、南宫旱田产棉区为主。期限一个月至一个半月。
