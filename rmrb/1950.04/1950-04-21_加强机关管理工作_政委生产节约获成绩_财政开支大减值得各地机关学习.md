　　Strengthen Departmental Management
    Political and Legal Affairs Committee Achieves Success in Production and Conservation
    Significant Reduction in Financial Expenditure Worthy of Study by Departments in Various Regions
    [Our Newspaper] In order to overcome the nation's financial difficulties, the State Council's Political and Legal Affairs Committee, in addition to vigorously streamlining its organization, has also launched a departmental production and conservation campaign, achieving significant results in the past three months. Given the characteristics of working in the city and in departments, the leadership has emphasized conservation as the main focus, supplemented by production, integrating production with learning, and fostering a concept of labor. In terms of production, diverse methods have been adopted. Organizing efforts, many cadres' family members have participated in sewing production, largely completing the summer clothing for employees of the department. General cadres have organized agricultural production, starting to accumulate fertilizer and plant vegetables, planning to produce 20,000 catties of vegetables. At the same time, there are plans for amateur production such as making straw sandals, knitting sweaters, and folding book pages. This year, each person is required to produce 50 catties of millet. In addition, based on the principle of benefiting both the public and private sectors, self-reliance is encouraged. Anything the department needs that can be done in-house should not be outsourced. For example, the Guard Platoon comrades have been mobilized to make ten tons of coal briquettes and weave flower-patterned straw door screens; the General Affairs Section comrades have made fifteen mops themselves; the kitchen comrades have built three high stoves themselves; the Public Service Team comrades have used their spare time to dismantle walls and use scrap iron to make 120 stovepipes, as well as organizing the department to transport coal, etc., saving a total of over 1,060 catties of millet. Vigorously practice thrift and improve administrative management, starting with adjusting telephone lines and newspapers. Administratively, focusing on key areas for in-depth inspection, it was found that there was waste in installing telephones and subscribing to newspapers, so measures were stipulated to reduce them. The number of telephones was reduced from ninety-six to forty-six, and the switchboard was reduced from two to one. The number of telephone operators was reduced from six to four. Because the "responsibility for connection system" was implemented, technology was improved, which not only did not affect calls but also brought its initiative into full play. For example, the recently implemented "proxy notification system," in which the telephone room conveys some general notices to the outside world on behalf of various departments, has reduced some administrative work for various departments. Depending on the size of the unit, newspapers are either shared by one or several units or read collectively in the library, reducing the number from one hundred and forty-six to ninety-one. The above two items saved more than 2,000 catties of millet in February. Following this, the use of electricity, water, coal, and gasoline was inspected, further promoting the conservation of the entire department. Originally, the electricity consumption in December was 1,746 kWh, exceeding the Ministry of Finance's stipulated 1,074 kWh (an average of four catties of rice per person per month in excess electricity costs). After inspection, methods were studied to reduce light bulbs, adjust candlepower, and strictly manage usage. Fifty unnecessary light bulbs were removed, and units with fewer people concentrated their office work or study at night, turning on fewer lights; the candlepower in dormitories and other places was reduced, and strict management was implemented, with "lights off on time, and off when not in use." As a result, February saved 626 kWh compared to December; March then reduced another 414 kWh compared to February. Along with centralized office work and adjusted dormitories, ten stoves were also reduced, saving 7,500 catties of coal. Regarding water use, the water consumption in December was 816 tons, exceeding the Ministry of Finance's stipulated 0.7 tons per person. Therefore, methods of saving were studied. In addition to mobilizing everyone to consciously save water and supervise each other when washing their faces, washing clothes, mopping floors, and using water for cooking, a well with a pump was also built, which can supply a minimum of eight tons of water per day, saving 240 tons of water per month. Regarding coal use, a quota system was implemented. The standard daily coal consumption was stipulated for boiler rooms and other units. On the premise of ensuring that everyone had hot water to drink at any time, those who used less than the standard due to conservation were rewarded at the end of the month. Now, compared to December, 60 catties of coal are saved per day, saving 1,800 catties of coal per month. In addition, when using gasoline, the motor vehicle team established a vehicle inspection system and a technical research group to repair old machines and reduce expenses. Leaky oil pots were welded, reducing the amount of oil used per mile from 2.1 taels to 1.5 taels. Standard oil consumption was also stipulated for different vehicles, and a "contracted ride system" was implemented, greatly saving gasoline. For public bicycles, three types of repair costs were set according to the condition of the bicycles to prevent overspending. Each unit also appointed special personnel to manage the bicycles, not riding them unnecessarily and paying attention to maintenance when riding, so the repair costs in March were 824 catties of rice less than in December. In carrying out the conservation movement, the leadership not only focused on key points but also grasped the spirit of "thinking big and starting small." For example, the Dispatch Section switched to using the post office to send general official documents and letters and strengthened inspections by telephone, thus reducing the number of messengers from ten to four, and six were sent to schools to study. This not only solved the problem of the old messengers' employment and streamlined the organization but also reduced a lot of expenses. For example, the Printing Section worked hard to save paper, adopting methods such as "printing different documents on different paper," changing the past single-sided printing of newspapers to double-sided printing, and using waste paper for proofs, etc., and cleaning and repairing the machines diligently to prevent them from malfunctioning. In this way, a total of more than 500 catties of rice were saved in February. In addition, such as using waste paper for drafts, making envelopes themselves, using leftover water from washing faces in large jars to wash mops and mop floors; uniformly managing housekeeping supplies (rags, mops, feather dusters, etc.) and personal responsibility; not wasting or over-receiving stationery supplies, etc., public miscellaneous expenses in February were more than 2,200 catties less than in December of last year.
    The above achievements were mainly obtained by implementing the principle of benefiting both the public and private sectors and thoroughly mobilizing the masses, thus launching a production and conservation wave throughout the department. Now, all units have successively formulated collective and individual production plans and plan to store the grain saved from production and conservation in the credit department of the cooperative on a monthly basis to help solve the family difficulties of staff members.

　　加强机关管理工作
    政委生产节约获成绩
    财政开支大减值得各地机关学习
    【本报讯】政务院政治法律委员会为克服国家财政困难，除厉行整编外，并开展了机关生产节约运动，三个月来，已获得不少成绩。由于在城市和机关工作的特点，领导上指出以节约为主，生产为辅，生产结合学习，锻炼劳动观念。生产方面，采用多种多样方法进行，组织力量，许多干部家属参加了缝纫生产，已大部完成了本机关职工的夏衣。一般干部组织农业生产，开始进行积肥种菜，计划生产蔬菜二万斤。同时计划进行打草鞋、打毛衣、折书页等业余生产。今年要求每人生产小米五十斤。此外，并根据公私两利的原则，提倡自己动手，凡是机关所需要而自己能做的事，就不另找人做。例如：已发动警卫排同志做煤球十吨，打花洞草帘子；庶务股同志自制墩布十五个，伙房同志自盘高灶三个；公务队同志利用业余拆墙，并利用废铁皮打烟筒一二○节，以及组织机关运煤等，计共节省小米一千零六十余斤。厉行节约，改进行政管理。是从调整电话机和报纸开始的。行政上抓住重点深入检查，发现安装电话及订阅报纸存在浪费情形，就规定了撤减办法，将电话机由九十六部减到四十六部，交换台由两座减为一座，电话员由六个减为四个，因为实行了“接线负责制”，提高技术，不但通话不受影响，且发挥了其积极性，如最近实行了“代行通知制”，由电话室代各部门向外传达一些普遍通知，就使各部门减少了一部分事务工作。报纸视单位大小，采取一个或几个单位合存阅一份，和集中到图书馆阅读的办法，由一百四十六份减到九十一份，上述两项，二月份共节省小米二千余斤。接着检查了电、水、煤、汽油等使用情况，进一步推动了整个机关节约。原来用电量，十二月份一七四六度，超过财政部规定一○七四度（平均每人每月超出电费米四斤），经检查后，研究了减少灯头，调整烛数，严格管理的办法。把不需要的灯撤去了五十盏，人少的单位晚上集中到一起办公或学习，少开灯头；宿舍等处减少烛光，并实行严格管理，“按时熄灯，不用即熄”。这样一来，二月份比十二月份节省六二六度；三月份则比二月份又减少四一四度。随着集中办公与调整宿舍，还减少了十个火炉，省煤七五○○斤。用水方面：十二月份用水量为八一六度，每人超出财政部规定零点七吨。因此就研究节省办法，除动员大家在洗脸、洗衣、擦地板、伙食用水时自觉节省并互相监督外，又建筑了一个压水井，每日最低可供水八吨，每月即省水二四○吨。关于用煤，实行了定量制，锅炉房等单位规定了每天用煤标准量，在保证大家随时有开水喝的前提下，凡因节省使用而少于标准者，月终奖励。现在较十二月份每天省煤六十斤，全月省煤一八○○斤。另外，使用汽油，汽车队建立了汽车检查制与技术研究组，修造废机器，减少开支，焊好漏油的油壶、使每华里的用油量由二两一降到一两五。并规定了不同车辆的用油标准，实行“包乘制”，汽油大为节省。公用自行车，按照车子好坏，订出三种修理费，防止超支，各单位也推定专人管理车子，无事不骑，骑时注意爱护，因此，三月份的修理费较十二月份节省八二四斤米。开展节约运动中，领导上不但抓住了重点，还掌握了“大处着眼、小处着手”的精神。例如收发科改用邮局寄送一般公文函件，并利用电话加强检查，遂将通讯员由十人减为四人，六人送入学校学习，这不仅解决了老通讯员的工作出路，精简了编制，并减少了很多开支。又如文印科努力节约用纸，采取“不同文件用不同纸张印刷”，将过去报纸的一面印刷改为两面印刷，用坏纸打校样等办法，并把机器勤加擦洗修理，使它不出毛病，这样，二月份共节省米五百余斤。此外，如利用废纸拟稿，自做信封，利用大缸储存洗脸用过的剩水，来洗刷墩布，擦地板；勤务用具（抹布、墩布，鸡毛帚等）实行统一管理，个人负责；文具用品不浪费不多领等，二月份公杂费支出即较去年十二月份节省了二千二百多斤。
    以上成绩的获得，主要是贯彻了公私两利的原则，和深入动员发动了群众，因此掀起了全机关的生产节约浪潮。现各单位均纷纷订立了集体与个人的生产计划，并拟把生产节约的粮食，按月储存合作社信用部，用以帮助解决工作人员的家庭困难。（政法委员会新闻秘书室）
