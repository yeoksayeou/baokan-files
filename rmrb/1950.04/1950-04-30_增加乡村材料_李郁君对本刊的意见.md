　　Increase Rural Material
    ——Li Yujun's Opinions on This Publication

To the Editor:

    People's Garden has helped me a lot; it is simply something I cannot live without every day. If I don't read People's Garden for a day, I feel extremely bored.

    But I have some opinions about People's Garden. There is more material about cities (especially Beijing) in People's Garden, and less material about rural areas. When I work in the countryside, I often hear rural readers say, "People's Garden is not worth reading, it's all about big places." People's Garden cannot meet the needs of the vast number of readers in small cities and rural areas, and it is not comprehensive enough. I don't know if this opinion is correct.

                                                Li Yu
    You have pointed out a one-sidedness that is indeed one of the major shortcomings of People's Garden, and your opinion is completely correct. We will do our best to overcome this shortcoming in the future and expand the readership. We hope that you and other readers will give us more opinions to help us improve the content and form of People's Garden.

### 增加乡村材料——李郁君对本刊的意见

　　增加乡村材料
    ——李郁君对本刊的意见编辑同志：
    人民园地对我帮助很大，简直是我每天不可缺少的东西；如果我一天不看人民园地，便觉得闷的荒。
    但我对人民园地有点意见。人民园地中关于城市（特别是北京市）的材料比较多些，关于乡村的材料比较少些。我下乡工作，常听见乡村的读者们说：“人民园地没看头，尽大地方的事。”人民园地不能满足小城市与乡村广大读者的要求，是不够全面性的。这意见不知是否对。
                                                李郁李郁君：
    你所指出的片面性，确是人民园地的大缺点之一，你的意见完全是对的。今后当竭力克服这一缺点，使读者圈扩大。希望你及其他读者们多向我们提意见，帮助我们改进人民园地的内容和形式。
