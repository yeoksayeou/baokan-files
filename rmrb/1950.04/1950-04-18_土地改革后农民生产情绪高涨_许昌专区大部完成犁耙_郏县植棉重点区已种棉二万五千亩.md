After Land Reform, Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production Soars
　　Most of Xuchang Prefecture Completes Plowing and Harrowing
　　Jia County Planting Area Plants 25,000 Mu of Cotton
[Our Henan News] In Baofeng, Jia County, Yu County, Lushan, Linru, Xiang County, Ye County and other seven counties in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, weeding of wheat and plowing and harrowing of spring land have been mostly completed. In January and February, people's representatives' meetings at all levels in various counties promptly studied and resolved the issue of how to shift to production after the land reform work was completed. After the meetings, representatives in various places widely publicized this, and governments at all levels deepened their promotion. The majority of farmers, having obtained the means of production after land reform, have unprecedentedly high enthusiasm for labor and production and have successively formulated this year's production plans.
Currently, Jia County has completely weeded 396,820 mu of wheat fields, plowed more than 160,000 mu of spring land, demolished village walls to expand arable land by 2,407 mu, opened 28 canals, dug a 35-li long river, built 55 bridges, and repaired 215 sections of roads, rescuing more than 8,000 mu of land, which will increase grain production by 680,000 jin. The sixth district is the key cotton planting area of the county, and 25,300 mu of cotton fields have been planted, and seedling cultivation of sweet potatoes and other crops is being actively carried out. Other counties have also plowed and harrowed more than 60% of their spring land.
In the spring plowing movement, cadres, rural Communist Party members, and Youth League members in various places have taken the lead actively, thereby inspiring the production enthusiasm of ordinary farmers. For example, in Huashi Township, Huashi District, Yu County, under the leadership of cadres such as Party members Wang Ju and Wang Xirong (female), they not only mobilized 46 women to work in the fields, but also moved the loafer Fu Chang to resolve to participate in labor.
Farmers in various counties are trying to add livestock during spring plowing. For example, Jia County has purchased 1,478 head of draught animals from the end of land reform to the present. Farmers also automatically find suitable people to exchange labor for human power, animal power, and capital power for production. Due to more weeding and fertilization, the wheat seedlings are in better condition this year than last year. At the symposium of old farmers in Yu County, a specific comparison was made between the wheat harvest last year and the condition of wheat seedlings this spring in Niutang, Zhuji and other seven villages in the eighth district of the county. It was believed that this year's average yield per mu could be 16 jin more than last year, exceeding last year's yield per mu by 14.8%.
In carrying out spring plowing production work, in addition to allocating 6 million jin of local grain and 1.5 million jin of livestock and agricultural implement loan grain from the People's Bank to the seven counties in Xuchang Prefecture as key loan recipients, the Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office paid special attention to the planting of special crops. In late March, Jia County, Linru County, and Yu County were designated as key cotton planting areas, and 144,460 jin of fine cotton seeds were loaned out. 800 jin of fine tobacco seeds were distributed to Xiang County, Yu County, and Jia County to help cotton and tobacco farmers improve varieties and increase the yield of special crops such as cotton and tobacco.
[Another News] The Henan Provincial People's Government, in order to support the people in the disaster areas to overcome the spring famine, issued another 3.5 million jin of disaster relief grain and 6.5 million jin of production loan grain on April 5th. (Han Feng)

　　土地改革后农民生产情绪高涨
    许昌专区大部完成犁耙
    郏县植棉重点区已种棉二万五千亩
    【本报河南讯】河南许昌专区宝丰、郏县、禹县、鲁山、临汝、襄县、叶县等七县锄麦、犁耙春地已大部完成，一、二月间各县各界人民代表会及时研究解决了土地改革工作结束后如何转向生产的问题，会后各地代表即广泛宣传，各级人民政府即深入推动，而大部农民在土地改革后获得生产资料，劳动生产情绪空前高涨，纷纷订立今年的生产计划。
    目前郏县已全部锄完了三十九万六千八百二十亩麦田。犁完了十六万多亩春地。并扒寨墙扩大耕地面积二千四百零七亩。开渠二十八条，挖河一条长三十五里，修桥五十五座，路二百一十五段，共救出土地八千多亩，将增产粮食六十八万斤。该县植棉重点为第六区，现已种了二万五千三百亩棉田，并正积极操作红薯等作物的育苗工作。其他各县也犁耙了百分之六十以上的春地。
    在春耕运动中，各地干部、农村共产党员及青年团员都积极带头，因而鼓舞了一般农民生产热情。如禹县花石区花石乡在党员王聚、王秀荣（女）等干部带头帮助下，不仅发动了四十六名妇女下地干活，且感动得二流子傅昌也下决心参加劳动。
    各县农民在春耕中都设法添设牲口。如郏县从土地改革结束到现在，即买了一千四百七十八头耕畜。农民们并自动找对劲人以人力、畜力、资力等价换工进行生产。由于多锄多上粪，今年麦苗情形比去年好。禹县老农民座谈会上，以该县八区牛堂、朱集等七村去年麦收和今春麦苗情况作具体比较，认为今年平均每亩可比去年多打小麦十六斤，超过去年每亩收成的百分之十四点八。
    开展春耕生产工作中，许昌专署除拨地方粮六百万斤及人民银行牲口农具贷粮一百五十万斤以该七县为重点贷放外，特别注意到特种作物的种植。三月下旬即以郏县、临汝、禹县三县为植棉重点，贷出优良棉种十四万四千四百六十斤，对襄县、禹县、郏县各发放优良烟种八百斤，以帮助棉、烟农改良品种、增加棉烟等特种作物的产量。
    【又讯】河南省人民政府，扶持灾区人民渡过春荒，四月五日，又发放赈济粮三百五十万斤。生产贷放粮六百五十万斤。（寒风）
