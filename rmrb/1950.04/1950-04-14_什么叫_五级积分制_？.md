　　What is the "Five-Grade Grading System"?

Editor:

    Could you please explain the details of the "Five-Grade Grading System" implemented in Soviet schools?

                                          Yang Peng

Comrade Yang Peng:

    The five-grade grading system implemented in Soviet schools is the most scientific and convenient method for accurately assessing students' actual performance. During classroom teaching, teachers assess students' learning situation in all aspects of speaking, reading, writing, and arithmetic. The best performance receives a five, the next best a four, average receives a three, below average receives a two, and the worst receives a one. In Soviet schools, each student has a grade book that is given to the teacher for grading during question-and-answer sessions. In addition to the grade book, monthly grades are compiled and posted on the classroom wall at the end of each month. Fives and fours are written in red, threes in green, and twos and ones in blue, to strengthen students' learning motivation. Problem setting and grading should consider the overall situation, not rigidly adhere to the old pattern of five, four, or ten questions. When grading papers, the grades should be determined based on the student's understanding of all the problems, not absolutely separated or averaged. Examination results should be evaluated at the end of each month and semester based on all the scores given during the month and semester. The evaluation method is not to average all the scores, but to determine the grade based on the grade that has the largest proportion. That is, whichever grade accounts for the highest percentage is the grade assigned. The grading standard should not vary based on the size or difficulty of the problem, but should be based on the degree of progress, learning attitude, and comprehensiveness of learning. The number of grading opportunities should be as frequent as possible. Too few grades do not accurately reflect the student's performance. Teachers should frequently use the grades to understand the student's issues and provide extracurricular guidance. Students who improve should be praised to encourage continued effort. Students who maintain their current level should be encouraged to improve. Students with inconsistent performance should be criticized to encourage consistent learning.

### 什么叫“五级积分制”？

　　什么叫“五级积分制”？编辑同志：
    苏联学校所实行的“五级积分制”的详细情形是怎样的？请答复。
                                          杨鹏杨鹏同志：
    苏联学校所实行的五级积分制记分法，是准确考验学生实际成绩的一种最科学最简便的方法。教师们在课堂教学过程里，从学生说、读、写、算各方面，来测验他们学习的情况，最好的给五分，较好的给四分，中等的给三分，劣等的给二分，最劣等的给一分。在苏联学校里，每个学生都有一本记分册，教师问答时，交给教师记分。除了记分册外，每月底还把全月的成绩统计出来，贴在每班墙壁上，五分与四分用红色填写，三分用绿色，二分与一分用蓝色，这样能加强学生学习情绪。出题与评分要顾及全局，不必老一套非五题、四题、十题不可；在批卷子时应按照学生对全部问题了解程度定分，不能绝对分开批或相加后平均计算。考试成绩，在每个月及一学期末要根据全月及全学期所划的全部分数来评定。评定方法，不是把全部分数相加平均而是根据那一级分所占比重最多来决定，就是那一级分的百分比占的最多，就评为那级分。记分标准，不应该根据题大与题小，题难与题易有所区别，而应该根据其进步程度学习态度学习全面与否来划。记分次数尽可能要多些，划少了看不出成绩究竟如何，教师要经常结合分数看问题，进行课外指导，对成绩提高的要表扬，使不断努力；对保持现状的要鼓励，使提高一步；对忽高忽低的要批评，使学习经常化。
