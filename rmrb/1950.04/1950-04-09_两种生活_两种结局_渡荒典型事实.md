Two Lives, Two Fates
Typical Story of Overcoming Hardship
Qing Xin

Chen Shiyi was thirty-nine years old, a farmer from Donghong Village, Jiangxin Island. His family consisted of eleven people, but only he and his two younger brothers were full laborers; his wife, a sister-in-law, and a younger sister were half laborers; his parents were old, and there were three young children, the oldest only six or seven years old, all dependent on others. The eleven mu of land they rented yielded only two *shi* of barley and a little over seven *shi* of wheat last spring, a total of nine *shi* of grain. This was simply not enough to support a family of eleven. On July 25th last year, when a typhoon struck, the river water breached the embankment, completely submerging the summer crops they had planted. Relying on the nine *shi* of spring wheat, the family of eleven could survive at most until October. They thought of government relief, but also remembered the government's difficulties. Everyone said, "A lazy person will starve to death even in a granary full of wheat, but a diligent person can make a stone blossom!"

So the family began to live frugally. They changed from two meals of dry food and one of porridge a day to one meal of dry food and one of porridge. They ground their own wheat to make wheat paste, saving grain in this way to last for more than a month. They also planted turnips and cabbage in front of their door and on the embankments that had not been flooded. They dried and crushed turnip greens obtained from trading wheat or from their own planting, mixing them into wheat flour to make "cakes." Their neighbor, Chen Yingxian, was a boatman. Seeing them eat turnip greens even when they had wheat, he laughed at them for "thinking too far ahead!" He said, "Turnip greens are for feeding pigs, how can people eat them?" Chen Shiyi explained the principle of "think of days without food when you have food, it's better to eat a little worse today than to starve later!" to Chen Yingxian, but Chen Yingxian continued to eat and drink as usual, ignoring Chen Shiyi's advice. Chen Yingxian's family consisted of six or seven people. He operated his own boat, taking people from Cotton Embankment to Jiangbei and then transporting grain from Jiangbei to Cotton Embankment. Each trip earned him at most a *shi* or so of rice, and at least five or six *dou*. But he did not think ahead and spent everything he earned. The two Chen families were developing in two different directions in their lifestyles.

Chen Shiyi's family always thought ahead and came up with ideas. The old man, as head of the family, kept a close watch. He was afraid that his sons and daughters-in-law would be tempted to eat the wheat seeds and not be able to plant in the winter. He told the children, "Without wheat seeds, we can't plant the fields, how will we live next year!" So he screened out one *shi* and five *dou* of good wheat in advance and hid it away for seed. In reality, the family only had a little over seven *shi* of wheat to eat.

Each family member was assigned a production task. The old man carried sweet potatoes to the market to sell, while Chen Shiyi and his two brothers thought of grinding wheat to sell flour, earning a total of more than two hundred *jin* of wheat bran, enough for the whole family to eat for half a month. The second brother also helped boatmen row, earning nine *dou* of rice for two months of work, excluding meals. The third brother went to work in a vegetable garden in Shuiximen for a month, earning five *dou* of rice, excluding meals. After returning, the third brother went to Jiangbei to collect firewood, exchanging the money from selling firewood for thirty *jin* of soybean cakes, two *dou* of wheat, and one *dou* and five *sheng* of rice. The government mobilized the farmers on the island to drain water and rush to plant winter wheat. Chen Shiyi's whole family turned out, not borrowing a single grain of wheat from the government, and managed to plant all eleven *mu* of land on their own. Now the wheat is growing lush and green, several inches high, which is truly heartening!

After planting the wheat, the three brothers went to Jiangbei to cut firewood again, leaving early and returning late every day for a month. They collected more than one thousand eight hundred *jin* of tree roots alone, exchanging them for more than one *shi* of rice. The reeds they gathered were enough for the family to burn for several months.

Since the water receded from the island, the women have also become active. Only the mother was left at home to take care of the three children. The wife, sister-in-law, and younger sister went out separately. The wife tended to the wheat fields while also picking wild vegetables. The sister and sister-in-law picked up cow dung and also picked some wild vegetables. The wild vegetables they brought back were more than the family could eat in a day, and the cow dung dried in the sun was more than they could use for fuel.

Although the family's stored grain was enough to get them through the spring famine by economizing, diligent people were not used to idleness. When the government mobilized laborers to repair the embankment, all three brothers participated in the work, together carrying five cubic *fang* of earth each day, earning fifteen *jin* of unhusked rice (equivalent to ten and a half *jin* of milled rice). Chen Shiyi himself worked as a cook in the township's embankment repair team. With all this, there was no question that Chen Shiyi's family would successfully overcome the disaster. While the men were repairing the embankment, the women were not idle. They continued to pick wild vegetables, collect cow dung, and had already begun digging out the melon fields, preparing to plant melons in the spring.

They have also made plans for the future. They plan to have all the able-bodied members of the family, both men and women, go across the river to dig artemisia stems and *kalimeris indica* after the embankment is repaired. The second brother is also planning to go fishing.

Chen Shiyi's family's life is bright and hopeful. But Chen Yingxian, who made money easily in the summer by ferrying people, spent it all as soon as he earned it. In the winter, when the ferrying business was slow, not only could he not afford big fish, but for a few days around the Spring Festival, he barely had anything to cook, and he was starving. He remembered the benefits of saving and borrowed turnip greens from Chen Shiyi to eat, and also learned to eat vegetable rice. Now he regrets not planning ahead.

　　两种生活·两种结局
    渡荒典型事实
    青心
    陈士义，三十九岁，江心洲东宏村农民。家有十一口人，但只他自己和两个弟弟三个全劳动力；他的老婆、一个弟媳、一个妹妹三个半劳动力；父亲母亲都已上了年纪，还有三个小孩子，最大的仅六七岁，都靠人养。租种的十一亩田，去年春季收大麦两石、小麦七石多，共九石多粮食，支持一家十一口人，无论如何是不够的。去年七月二十五日，刮台风时，江水冲破江堤，所种的夏季作物完全淹没。要靠那九石多的春麦，一家十一人至多能生活到十月。指望政府救济吧，又想起了政府的困难，大家都说：“懒人睡在麦仓中也会饿死，勤人动手石头也会开花！”
    这一家子就俭吃省用起来。一天二干一稀的生活，先改为一干一稀；把自己的麦子磨了吃麦糊，这样省下的粮，可以多维持一个多月。他们又在门口及未被水淹的埂垄上点种葫萝卜及白菜，又把麦子换来的和自己种的萝卜缨子晒干，揉碎掺到麦粉中做“饼”吃。他们的邻居陈英贤是船户，看见他们在有麦子的时候就吃萝卜缨子，笑他们“想得太远”！说：“萝卜缨子人家喂猪的，人怎么能吃？”陈士义把“有吃当思无吃日，今天吃得坏点，总比以后没东西吃挨饿好！”的道理说给陈英贤听，但陈英贤还是吃喝如故，不听陈士义的劝告。陈英贤家有六七口人，摇自己的船，从棉花堤带人到江北，再由江北运粮至棉花堤，来回一趟，多了可落石把米，少了也有五六斗；但他不往后想，有了一顿光。两个陈家，生活方式朝两个方向发展了。
    陈士义家的人，尽往远处想，动脑筋想点子。老头子当家抓得特别紧，他怕儿子媳妇吃得眼花，把麦种吃掉冬天下不了种，对孩子们说：“没有麦种，种不了田，来年又怎样过日子！”便预先筛出一石五斗好麦藏起来作麦种，家中实际上能吃的只有七石多麦子了。
    家里几口人都分配了生产任务。老头子挑担子到市上去卖烤红薯，陈士义弟兄三人，想起磨麦子来卖面，共赚了二百多斤麦麸，足够全家吃半月。二弟也帮船户摇桨，干了两个月，除吃赚回九斗米；三弟又到水西门一家菜园去帮工，干了一个月，除吃赚了五斗米。三弟回来后，又上江北打柴，卖柴的钱换了三十斤豆饼，二斗小麦，一斗五升米。政府发动洲上农民排水赶种冬麦，陈士义家中的人全体出动，没有向政府借一颗小麦，自力把十一亩田都种上，现在已经绿茵茵地长起寸把高的小麦，看了真令人开心！
    种了小麦以后，三弟兄又到江北砍柴，每天早出晚归一个月的时光，光只树根一项即得一千八百多斤，换了一石多米，所拾的芦柴足足够自家烧几个月。
    自从洲上水退以后，女人们也活动开了。家里只留了母亲照看三个孩子，老婆、弟媳与妹妹分头出去，老婆在地里一面照料麦田，一面挑野菜，妹妹与弟媳一面拾牛粪，一面也挑些野菜，挑回的野菜一家一天吃不完，牛粪晒干烧锅用不完。
    家里的存粮虽然已可以节省着对付渡过春荒，但勤人是过不惯闲日子的，政府动员民工修堤时，三弟兄都参加了工作，每天合起来可挑五方土，能落稻子十五斤（合米十斤半），陈士义本人在乡修堤部队当炊事员。这么一来，陈士义家的灾荒，胜利渡过是更无问题了。在男人修堤期间，女人也不闲着，她们照样挑野菜，拾牛粪，并且已开始刨料瓜地，准备春暖种瓜了。
    以后的计划，他们也已订出来。准备在修完堤以后，全家凡能劳动的，不论男女都要过江去刨蒿梗、马兰头，二弟弟并且计划着打鱼。
    陈士义家的生活，是光明的，有希望的。而那个陈英贤，夏天摇船生意好，钱赚得容易，但他随赚随花，都吃光了；冬季摇船生意清淡，如今不但吃不成大鱼，春节前后有几天简直没揭锅盖，饿得撑不住。他想起了节约的好处，向陈士义借了葫萝卜缨去吃，并且学着吃菜饭了。这时是跌脚后悔自己没打算了。
