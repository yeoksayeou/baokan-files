　　Xinhua News Agency, March 31st—Eight hundred students and professors from universities in the capital, Beijing, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Central Academy of Fine Arts, and Central Academy of Drama, participated in the land reform work in the suburban areas of Beijing during the winter vacation. They have now returned to their respective schools and have made summaries of their work and thoughts. Professors Feng Youlan, Wu Zelin, and Lei Haizong from the Faculty of Arts of Tsinghua University, Professor Wang Xuan from Peking University, President Xu Beihong of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Professors Li Hua, Ye Qianyu, and Chang Renxia, President Ouyang Yuqian and Vice President Cao Yu of the Central Academy of Drama all participated in this land reform work. Under the unified leadership of the Suburban Work Committee and District Committees of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and various work teams, students and professors from various schools have done a lot of work for the emancipation movement of 600,000 farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, and at the same time, they have also transformed themselves ideologically. Before the start of the winter vacation last December, students and professors from various schools generally carried out preparatory work and studied the land reform policy. The Central Academy of Fine Arts also invited Chai Zemin, Secretary of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, to give three reports. Students and professors from various schools organized work teams or working groups, which were assigned by the district work committees to 65 work teams in eight districts in the suburbs of Beijing, to carry out work in more than 100 administrative villages. During the two months of work, they participated in mass meetings, farmer representative meetings, and accusation meetings in various districts, and carried out practical work such as mobilizing the masses, classifying classes, distributing the fruits of labor, adjusting land, and issuing land use certificates, as well as other cultural and recreational activities. In the activities of farmers pouring out their grievances, opposing local bullies, and classifying classes, the students and professors from various schools saw the cruelty of the feudal landlords' exploitation of the peasants and the strength of the peasants after their liberation. They initially changed their positions, viewpoints, and methods of looking at problems, and initially established the outlook on life of serving the people. After participating in the land reform work, some students and professors eliminated their doubts about the land reform policy and had a more correct view of their family backgrounds. Most students deeply felt the correctness of the land reform policy and had a further understanding of the Communist Party of China, and therefore actively requested to join the Party and the League. In addition, everyone also specifically experienced the simplicity and hard life of the peasants, and learned a lot of production knowledge. After being tempered by this actual struggle, the students and professors from various schools had a relatively profound understanding of the shortcomings of intellectuals, and therefore increased their determination to transform themselves seriously.

    寒假参加郊区土改  思想认识显著提高
    【新华社三十一日讯】首都北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学、中央美术学院、中央戏剧学院等院校的学生和教授八百人，在寒假期间下乡参加了京市郊区的土地改革工作，现已先后返校，并分别作了工作和思想的总结。清华大学文法学院教授冯友兰、吴泽霖、雷海宗，北京大学教授汪暄，中央美术学院院长徐悲鸿，教授李桦、叶浅予、常任侠，中央戏剧学院院长欧阳予倩、副院长曹禺等都参加了这次土地改革工作。各校的学生和教授们，在中共北京市委会郊区工作委员会、区委会及各工作组的统一领导下，为京市郊区六十万农民的翻身运动作了很多工作，同时也在思想上改造了自己。各校师生于去年十二月间，在寒假开始前，一般都进行了准备工作，学习土地改革政策。中央美术学院并请中共北京市委会郊区工作委员会书记柴泽民作了三次报告。各校学生和教授分别组织工作队或工作小组，由各区工作委员会分配到京郊八个区的六十五个工作组中，在一百多个行政村进行工作。在两个多月的工作中，他们参加了各区的群众大会、农民代表会、控诉大会等集会，并进行发动群众、划分阶级、分果实、调剂土地、颁发土地使用证等项实际工作以及其他文化娱乐活动。各校的学生和教授们在农民诉苦、反对恶霸、划分阶级等活动中，看到封建地主对农民剥削的残酷，看到农民翻身后的力量后，初步改变了自己看问题的立场、观点和方法，并初步确定了为人民服务的人生观。若干学生和教授经过参加土地改革工作后，消除了对土地改革政策的怀疑，对自己家庭成份也有了较正确的看法。大部分学生则深深地感到土地改革政策的正确，对中国共产党有了更进一步的认识，因而积极要求入党和入团。此外，大家也都具体体验到农民的朴素和艰苦的生活，并学到了不少的生产知识。经过这次实际斗争的锻炼，各校学生和教授们都比较深刻地认识了知识分子的缺点，因而都增加了严肃地改造自己的决心。
