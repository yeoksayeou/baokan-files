　　Northeast Bank Changes Business Policy
    Gradually Becoming the Settlement, Credit, and Cash Center of the National Economy in the Northeast Region

　　[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Special correspondent Tian Liu reports: The Northeast Bank has successfully completed a new shift in its business policy, gradually becoming the settlement, credit, and cash center of the national economy in the Northeast region, further undertaking the task of organizing and controlling currency, centralizing funds, expanding credit, stabilizing finance, and promoting production. In order to implement the "Order to Establish an Independent Accounting System and Establish a New Settlement System" promulgated by the Northeast People's Government on January 10 this year, the Northeast Bank promptly transformed its business policy from the past financial appropriation and supply method to a credit system and new settlement relations. In the past three months, the bank has signed contracts with a total of forty-two units, including bureaus and mines under the Ministry of Industry, companies under the Ministry of Commerce, and state-owned enterprises such as railways and forestry, establishing a new settlement system. Starting in April, this settlement system will also penetrate into factories, mines, and provincial and municipal state-owned local enterprises. Since the implementation of this new policy, good results have been achieved. First of all, cash has been greatly saved. For example, the cash paid by seventeen units under the Ministry of Industry in January was nearly one-half less than before the implementation of the settlement system. The ratio of cash payments to non-cash transfer payments in Anshan was one to fifteen in January, and further rose to one to twenty-five in February. If a non-cash transfer settlement system is not implemented, it would be necessary to issue twenty-five times more currency to solve the need for capital turnover. After the implementation of the new settlement system, although no banknotes were issued this year, the sufficient supply of funds for various state-owned enterprises was still guaranteed, maintaining large-scale production and commerce. The promotion and gradual deepening of this new business have also vigorously promoted the capital turnover and economic accounting of various enterprises, and the bank's deposits have also greatly increased. Deposits in the first quarter of this year increased by 1.3 times compared with the end of last year (before the implementation of the new policy), and the amount of deposits has reached 130% of the total amount issued. Due to the increase in deposits, the bank's strength has become more abundant, and credit business has expanded accordingly, further undertaking the role of promoting production. The loans issued in the first quarter of this year were equal to the total amount issued, and the credit in March increased by one time compared with the end of last year, solving the difficulties of insufficient funds in forestry, native products, grain purchase, commodity promotion, and production processes of some enterprises. With the establishment of a settlement system between the bank and various units, there is a better understanding of the production status and financial income and expenditure status of various enterprises (units that establish settlement relations with the bank must submit production plans and income and expenditure plans to the bank regularly in accordance with the contract), coupled with great improvements in the bank's working methods and style, such as strict inspection of the cash income and expenditure of various units, establishment of mobile collection teams, establishment of offices or resident staff in large enterprises, extension of working hours, acting as the national treasury, all fiscal revenues and expenditures, profits turned over by enterprises, taxes, depreciation fees are deducted and remitted by the bank, and cash management work is more thorough through settlement, deposits into the treasury, and issuance of public bonds all through the bank. This makes the bank truly become the national cash center, effectively controlling and regulating currency, and stabilizing financial prices. In the first quarter of this year, prices in Northeast China only rose by 6.8% (of which, due to industrial recovery and large-scale construction, building materials, hardware, and electrical materials rose by 18.6%. If calculated according to daily necessities, most of them fell), and have begun to enter a normal state of price stability. In order to further implement the new business policy and vigorously cooperate with the large-scale economic construction in the Northeast region this year, it has been decided to gradually implement settlement, credit, and cash management work in state-owned mines and provincial and municipal state-owned local enterprises in the second quarter, so that the bank truly becomes the hub of the national economy, undertaking the task of a reservoir and regulator of national economic assets.

　　东北银行转变业务方针
    逐渐成为东北区国家经济的结算、信贷、现金中心
    【本报专讯】特派记者田流报道：东北银行已胜利完成业务方针新转变，逐渐成为东北区国家经济的结算、信贷、现金中心，进一步担负起组织与掌握货币，集中资金，扩大信贷，稳定金融，推进生产的任务。东北银行为执行今年一月十日东北人民政府颁布的“建立独立会计制度，建立新的结算制度”的命令，及时地转变了自己的业务方针，从东北过去财经拨付供给性质的办法，转变为信贷制度和新的结算关系。三个月来，该行已同工业部各局矿，商业部各公司及铁路林业等国营企业共四十二个单位，订立了合同，建立起新的结算制度。从四月份开始，这种结算制度，并将深入到工厂、矿山和省、市营地方企业。这种新方针实行以来，已经获得良好效果。首先是大大的节省了现金，如工业部所属十七个单位，一月份支付的现金，比实行结算制度以前节省了将及二分之一。鞍山的现金支付与非现金的转账支付比率，一月份为一比十五，二月份更上升至一比二十五。如果不实现非现金的转账结算制度，就需再发行二十五倍的货币，才能解决资金周转的需要。实行了新的结算制度后，今年虽未发行一张钞票，仍然保证各国营企业资金能充分供应，维持了大规模的生产与商业的进行。这种新业务的推行和逐渐深入，还有力地促进了各企业的资金流转和经济核算，银行的存款也大为增加了。今年第一季度比去年底（实行新方针前）存款增加了一点三倍，存款额已达总发行额的百分之一百三十。由于存款增多，银行的力量更加充裕，信贷业务随之扩大，进一步担负起推动生产的作用。今年第一季度放款已与总发行额相等，三月份的信贷比去年底增加一倍，解决了林业、土产及粮食购买、商品推销和某些企业生产过程中资金不足的困难。随着银行同各单位建立结算制度后，对各企业的生产状况、财务收支状况有了更进一步的了解（同银行建立结算关系之单位，均须按照合同定期将生产计划与收支计划送交银行），加上银行工作方法与作风有了很大的改进，如严格检查各单位现金收支情况，建立流动收款组，在大企业设立办事处或派驻在员，延长工作时间，代理国家金库，凡财政收支、企业部门上缴利润、税收、折旧费均经银行代为扣解，由结算、存款中拨入金库及公债发行等都经过银行等，现金管理工作就更加彻底了。这就使银行真正成了国家的现金中心，有效地掌握与节制了货币，稳定了金融物价。今年第一季度东北物价仅上升百分之六·八（其中因为工业恢复，大量修建，建筑器材五金电料上涨百分之一八·六。如按生活必需品计算，则大部下跌），已开始步入物价稳定的正常状态。为更进一步贯彻新业务方针，有力地配合今年东北区大规模的经济建设，决定第二季度将结算、信贷及现金管理工作逐渐贯彻到国营矿厂及省、市营地方企业中去，使银行真正成为国家经济的枢纽，担负起国家经济资财的贮水池与调节所的任务。
