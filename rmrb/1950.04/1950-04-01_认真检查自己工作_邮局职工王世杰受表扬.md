　　Conscientiously Checking His Work
    Post Office Employee Wang Shijie Commended

Editor:
    On the 12th, I went to the Chang'an Street Post Office in Dadong District, Shenyang City, to mail a package. That day was Sunday, and it was very crowded. Since Comrade Wang Shijie was the only one handling business at the post office, he was quite busy and miscalculated my package fee, giving me 40,000 yuan less in change. I didn't realize it at the time. The next day, I received a letter from Comrade Wang explaining his mistake and asking me to come and collect the money. This spirit of conscientiously taking responsibility for checking his work and serving the people is worthy of commendation.

　　认真检查自己工作
    邮局职工王世杰受表扬编辑同志：
    我在十二日到沈市大东区长安街邮局寄包裹。那天是礼拜天，人很拥挤，而邮局只有王世杰同志一个人办理业务，所以比较忙乱，将我的包裹费算错了，少找给我四万元。当时我也不知道。第二天，我接到王同志来信，说明他的错误，并叫我去领钱。这种认真负责检查自己工作为人民服务的精神，是值得表扬的。
