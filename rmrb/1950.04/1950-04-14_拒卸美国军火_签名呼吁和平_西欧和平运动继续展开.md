　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Despite the brutal suppression by reactionary governments, the people of Western Europe continue to launch movements against war, for peace, and to refuse to unload American arms. Summarizing TASS reports: Eight thousand five hundred miners in the French departments of Loire and Corrèze convened mass rallies on the 6th, demanding the withdrawal of the expeditionary forces from Vietnam. The meeting also elected a delegation of one hundred and fifty people to go to Lyon to request the release of patriotic individuals imprisoned in the Montluc fortress for standing up to defend peace. The petition submitted to the authorities by the miners' delegation contained the signatures of fifteen thousand working people.
　　Dockworkers in Trieste and other port workers held rallies, strongly protesting the attempt to transform the port into a military transit station, and announced that any attempt to unload American arms supplies to Italy in the port would be met with resolute resistance. Workers from the ports of Venice, Genoa, and Naples in Italy sent delegations to participate in the meeting. At the same time, the Trieste Peace Committee's appeal to the Security Council protesting the unloading of arms in Trieste has been signed by thirty thousand citizens in two days.
　　Dockworkers in Ostend and Antwerp, Belgium, reiterated their resolution not to handle American arms. The Belgian Women's League for the Defense of Peace issued an open letter to dockworkers and working people, calling for opposition to war preparations and refusal to unload American arms.
　　The Peace Committees of the Umbria region of Italy convened a mass rally in Perugia on the 10th, attended by 20,000 people, calling for peace.
　　Despite police interference, five hundred students in Geneva, Switzerland, signed the "Peace Appeal."
　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: German News Agency reported: The campaign to collect signatures for the Peace Appeal began in West Germany on April 9th. On the first day, the movement had already become a real and moving demonstration of peace advocates against new war provocateurs. Tens of thousands of people signed the appeal. The signature campaign will continue until May 2nd. More than half of all workers in many mines and steel factories in the Rhine and Ruhr areas (in the British occupation zone) have already signed the appeal. The Peace Advocacy Committee of Bavaria (in the American occupation zone) urged the people to actively participate in the Peace Congress to be held in Nuremberg (in the American occupation zone) on April 22nd and 23rd.
