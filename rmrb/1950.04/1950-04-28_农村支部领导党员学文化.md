Rural Branch Leaders Lead Party Members in Studying Culture
	Inspire Conscious Cultural Learning
		The CCP branch of Zhuangli Village, Third District, Lingchuan County, has greatly improved the ideological awareness of its party members after democratic party building. Under the direct leadership of the district committee, it actively rectified its learning organization and conducted learning, achieving great results. The village branch has 61 party members, with three sub-branches. Each sub-branch elects a party member as a cultural instructor, responsible for leading everyone's learning. They also form study groups freely based on the area, and the branch committee is responsible for centralized research and discussion every third, sixth, and ninth day of the month. The learning content is mainly cultural, stipulating that each person should strive to write one large-character calligraphy paper every day and memorize new characters. Starting from February 18th (the second day of the first lunar month), after more than 20 days of learning, more than 20 people who originally did not recognize a single character now recognize up to 50 characters, and at least 20 characters. The reason for the success of the village branch's learning is mainly that the branch inspires party members to recognize the principle that they cannot work without learning. For example, party member Guo Duwang is in charge of civil affairs work, but he cannot recognize the instructions and notices from superiors, and he deeply feels the difficulty in his work, so he is determined to study culture. He spent 2,400 yuan to subscribe to the Shanxi Peasant Newspaper, not only studying himself, but also often telling the masses about it at meal times. After seven months of hard self-study, he has now learned more than 1,000 characters and can read most of the Peasant Newspaper. Party member Guo Nianhai (now in his thirties) was not aware of it at first, thinking that rural party members could not learn at all. Guo Duwang patiently persuaded him with his own learning achievements. As a result, Nianhai's thinking changed, and now he has also learned more than 60 characters. Under his influence, most of the party members have started learning. Branch Secretary Zhang Fuquan is now in his forties. He writes one large-character calligraphy paper every day, and he reads the characters on the practice paper even when he gets up in the middle of the night to feed the livestock. He has now recognized more than 100 characters. He also called on everyone to learn from Guo Duwang, implement the instructions of superiors, and conscientiously adhere to the learning system.
	Secondly, the close combination of learning and application, and the implementation of the "three meetings" (reading meeting, writing meeting, reciting meeting) learning method is also one of the reasons for the achievement. The general party members of the village branch have overcome the attitude of learning strange characters and learning for fun and curiosity. They have brought into play the spirit of using what they learn immediately. For example, when Guo Duwang received a statistical form from his superiors, he immediately asked others if he did not recognize some of the places. On the one hand, he recognized the characters, and on the other hand, he filled out the form. For example, when Branch Secretary Zhang Fuquan encounters characters he does not recognize, he asks people, whether adults or children. When resting in the fields, he sits down and writes characters on the ground with his fingers.
	In addition, carrying out learning tests and summaries, and democratically selecting learning models, also greatly promotes learning. Recently, the village branch conducted a test, and more than 20 people have a preliminary understanding of the basic conditions, obligations, and rights that a communist party member should have. Guo Duwang, Guo Tianbao, Guo Xiwang, Zhang Fuquan, and others were elected as learning models through democratic evaluation.

	(Editor's Note: The method of Zhuangli Village Branch leading party members to study culture is good, but how to study together with non-Party cadres and active elements among the masses to promote rural cultural education work still needs attention.)
	The Literacy Method of the Xiaguan Ying Village Branch
		The Xiaguan Ying Village Branch in the Ninth District of Luan County, Hebei Province, created a literacy method for party member cultural learning this spring. The branch education compiles a sentence of seven characters according to the central work of each period. In seven days, illiterate party members not only learn seven new characters, but also understand the policy of the central work. For example, around the Spring Festival, the central work was to issue land certificates and the government called on the village not to ask for money during the New Year. The branch instructor compiled "Land and property ownership certificate" and "Don't gamble during the Chinese New Year". When the higher party and government called for production to overcome famine and the three-level election, they compiled "Revolutionary work must be taken seriously, save and be frugal, and don't ask for help, and the three-level election movement begins..." and so on. Everyone is very satisfied with this method of learning new characters by reciting words and phrases. Fu Lianyun, Fu Yongchang, and many others said, "If we learn like this, we can learn a lot by the end of the year, and even the most clumsy people can recognize hundreds of characters." From the end of last year to the end of March this year, they have indeed achieved great results in three months. Fu Zhenqi, Dongsheng, Huaning, and other five people who only had a junior elementary school education in the past have now improved to the fifth grade of elementary school and can speak preliminary revolutionary theory. Others who only had a first or second grade elementary school education have also improved to the third grade. Among the illiterates, the active ones have learned five hundred characters, and the general ones have also recognized one or two hundred characters.

　　农村支部领导党员学文化
  启发自觉学文化
    陵川县三区庄里村中共支部，经过民主建党后，党员思想觉悟大大提高。在区委直接领导下，积极整顿学习组织，进行学习，收到很大成绩。该村支部共有党员六十一人，设有三个分支，每个分支都选出一个党员，担任文化教员，负责领导大家学习。并根据地区，自由结合组成学习小组，每逢三、六、九日由支委负责集中研究讨论。学习内容以文化为主，规定每人每天争取写一张大楷，并记生字。从二月十八日（旧历正月初二）开始经二十余天学习，有二十多人原来一字不识，现在最多已识五十余字，最少已识二十多字。该村支部学习获得成绩的原因，主要是支部启发党员认识不学习就不能工作的道理。如党员郭独旺担任民政工作，但认不得上级的指示和通知，工作上深深感到困难，于是就下决心学习文化。自己拿二千四百元订了份山西农民报，不光自己学习，还经常在饭场上给群众讲着听，经过七个月的刻苦自修，现已学会一千多字，已能将农民报大半念下来。党员郭年亥（现已三十余岁）开始时不觉悟，认为农村党员根本就不能学习，郭独旺就用自己的学习成绩耐心说服，结果年亥思想转变，现在也学会六十多个字了。在他的影响下，大部党员都学习开了。支书张福全现已四十多岁，每天写一张大楷，半夜起来喂牲口也要念一念仿纸上的字。现在已识字一百多个。他还号召大家向郭独旺学习，执行上级指示，认真坚持学习制度。
    其次，学与用紧密结合，贯彻三会（念会、写会、背会）的学习方法也是得到成绩的原因之一。该村支部一般党员都克服了学怪字、为取乐好奇而学习的态度。发挥了当下学会当下就要使用的精神，如郭独旺当上级发来统计表，自己有的地方不认得，马上就去问别人。一方面识了字，一方面把表填了。又如支书张福全遇见不识的字就问人，不管大人或儿童他都要问，在地里休息时，坐下就在土上用手指写字。
    另外，进行学习测验与总结，民主评选学习模范，对学习也有很大推动作用。最近该村支部进行了一次测验，有二十多人对共产党员应有的起码条件和义务、权利都初步领会了。郭独旺、郭天保、郭喜旺、张福全等经民主评议当选了学习模范。

    （编者按：庄里村支部领导党员学习文化的办法是好的，但如何与非党干部和群众中的积极分子共同学习，以推动农村的文化教育工作，则是仍须注意的。）
  夏管营村支部的认字办法
    河北滦县九区夏管营村支部，今春在党员文化学习上创造出一个认字办法。支部教育根据每一时期的中心工作编成七个字的一句话，七天里边文盲党员不但认会了七个生字，并且还明白了中心工作的政策。如春节前后中心工作是发土地照及政府号召村中过年不许要钱，支部教员便编成了“土地房产所有证”，“大过新年不赌钱”，上级党和政府号召生产渡荒及三级选举时，又编出了“革命工作要认真，省吃俭用不求人，三级选举运动起……”等。这种念词句学生字的办法，大家都很满意。傅连云、傅永昌等好多人都说：“照这样的学法，赶年下都能学的顶事，心眼多笨的也能认会几百个字。”自去年年底到今年三月底三个月时间内，他们确也获得了很大成绩。过去只有初小三年级文化程度的傅振起、东生、华宁等五人现在已提高到小学五年级的程度，能讲初步革命理论。其他只有初小一、二年级程度的也提高到了三年级的程度。文盲中积极的已学会五百来字，一般的也认识了一、二百字。
