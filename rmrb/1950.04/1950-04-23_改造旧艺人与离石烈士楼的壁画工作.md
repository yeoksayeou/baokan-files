Remolding Old Artists and the Mural Work on the Martyrs' Building in Lishi

Editor's Note: Lishi County, Shanxi Province, has achieved success in uniting and leading folk painters to engage in painting revolutionary historical murals. This experience is very good and worth adopting and referencing in various regions.

Lishi County, Shanxi Province, has done a good job in remolding old artists. Their work is outstanding, and the most significant achievement is reflected in the mural work on the Martyrs' Building in Lishi City.

However, Lishi County's achievement is not accidental. Local leaders began working on remolding old artists as early as 1944. At that time, Lishi belonged to the Third Sub-district of the former Jin-Sui Border Region. After the rectification movement in 1944, the Third Sub-district held a forum for folk artists in Lin County. In addition to old opera performers and blind storytellers, eight rural "painters" also participated in the meeting. At that time, these eight art practitioners were organized into a group, and ideological and creative education was carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

These eight "painters" were mostly from poor peasant backgrounds and had very low social status. Their skills mainly served the feudal landlord class. They were initially fearful and uneasy about attending the folk artists' forum because they did not understand it beforehand. After ideological education, their class consciousness improved, and they gained a new understanding. They then began to try painting works with new content. At that time, they created three kinds of New Year pictures, including "Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction, Redemption of Land," "Abundant Food and Clothing," and "Husband and Wife Supporting the Army." These New Year pictures depicted the ferocity of the landlords, as well as the joy of redeeming land and people living a prosperous life. It is said that these paintings were very popular among the masses at the time. However, the printing conditions at that time were very poor. The old "painter" Qin Defu used five sheets of hemp paper pasted together and coated with tung oil, drew the picture on a paper plate, and cut it out with a knife, which could also be used for five-color stencil printing. With the help of the government, a total of 2,700 copies of the three paintings were printed using this local printing method, and they were all sold later. As a result, the old artists each received manuscript fees worth one stone of millet, which solved many of their family's difficulties. This provided the old artists with a new economic outlet, giving them greater confidence in painting pictures with new content.

After this forum on literature and art, art work in the Lishi and Lin County areas became particularly active. For example, many wall paintings about production and the struggle against the enemy appeared in villages and towns such as Anye, Qidao, Chenzhuang, Baiwen, and Qikou in Lin County. Many new content pictures were also painted on the facade of the state-owned store in Sanjiao Town, Lin County. Most of these paintings were painted by old artists who participated in the forum. At the same time, to commemorate the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, a martyrs' tower was built in Sanjiao Town. Inside the tower, a clay sculpture of a People's Liberation Army soldier was placed, with one foot stepping on a Japanese invader and the other foot stepping on a traitor. Passers-by would go to the tower to take a look, feeling that this work was meaningful.

In April and May 1949, Lishi built another Martyrs' Building. There are forty large continuous murals on this Martyrs' Building, all painted by folk artists. From the Japanese invasion of Lishi to the defeat and escape of Yan Xishan's troops, the paintings depict until 1946 when the Japanese surrendered and our army liberated Lishi City. It had a great impact on the local masses.

In April 1949, the county party committee, the county government, and the former Third Sub-district of the Jin-Sui Border Region jointly organized a committee for the construction of the Martyrs' Building. All work was led by this committee. The committee also collected materials on the content of the paintings. The target of material collection was people who had personally participated in the struggle against the enemy, the puppets, and Yan Xishan's forces. After each fact was discussed, it had to be studied by the research committee organized by the county committee and the county government. The outline was also drafted by the committee. The painting work was led by art worker Comrade Zhang Bin. Comrade Zhang Bin also drafted most of the paintings, a total of forty paintings. After Comrade Zhang Bin finished painting according to the outline, the research committee reviewed them one by one before painting them on the wall. When painting on the walls, it was done by two painters who were relatively good at painting. One was named Ren Yuting, in his thirties, from Fenyang, now living in Liulin, Lishi. This person's skills were relatively high among the painters; the other was Li Guozhi, from Lin County, in his forties. After Comrade Zhang Bin gave the paintings to Ren and Li, he first explained the story and then explained the painting method. After the work began, Ren Yuting painted the east wall, and Li Guozhi painted the west wall. As a result, the east wall was painted better than the west wall. In particular, the two paintings created by Ren Yuting, "Yan Xishan and the Puppet Regime Collude to Occupy Liulin, Three Hundred Militiamen Encircle the City," and "The Army and the People Night Raid Wohuwan, the Puppet Army Defects as Internal Support," were praised by the masses. These forty paintings started in the fourth month of the lunar calendar and continued until late May, for a total of more than fifty days. It is said that the entire work of the Martyrs' Building was completed by the participation of eighteen old "painters" and thirty stone masons. All the patterns and patterns on the monument were also new content.

During the construction, the masses often came to see it. After the completion of the Martyrs' Building, even more masses came to visit. After seeing it, the masses hated the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and even cursed the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs. Some masses gathered together to talk about how the Japanese puppets, Yan Xishan, and Chiang Kai-shek harmed people and massacred the people; and praised our militia and the people of Lishi for their heroic struggle against the enemy puppets. Regarding the content of the paintings, some comrades or militiamen who had participated in the struggle against the enemy and the puppets believed that there was no falsehood at all. Some comrades and militiamen, as soon as they entered the Martyrs' Building, saw a painting that they had personally participated in, and then they began to publicize it to the audience. For more than a month, groups of spectators kept coming and going, and even now, people still go up to visit from time to time. In the past six months, a total of more than 60,000 people have come to see it. This incident caused a sensation in Lishi, Fangshan County, and Zhongyang County. Later, Martyrs' Buildings were also built in Zhongyang and Fangshan counties, and the murals in the buildings were also painted by these old artists.

In the very center of the Lishi Martyrs' Building are two portraits, one is the portrait of Comrade He Chang, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China during the Ten-Year Civil War. He Chang was from Lishi and later died in Jiangxi. The other is the portrait of Comrade Han Changtai, the former county head of Lishi. Comrades who had worked with him all said that the painting looked like him. Some villagers said: "I haven't seen Han Changtai for many years, and he has become much thinner!" - Comrade Han Changtai was killed by secret agents in 1943.

I saw the art work of the Lishi Martyrs' Building with my own eyes. Although the murals have not completely broken away from the style of old figure paintings in terms of technique and character image, some scenes are very vivid, and the masses love to see them. Even if these paintings still have many shortcomings, because they are works of new content painted by old artists and have played a considerable educational role for the masses, we should pay attention to them. These paintings are the first step taken by old artists in the process of remolding, the first step for old artists to serve the people through art, and a step forward. Therefore, it is more meaningful for areas across the country that have not yet carried out the remolding of old artists, and can be used as a reference.

### 改造旧艺人与离石烈士楼的壁画工作

　　改造旧艺人与离石烈士楼的壁画工作
    编者按：山西离石县团结与领导民间画家从事于绘画革命历史壁画的工作，已获得成绩。这个经验是很好的，值得各地采用、参考。
    山西离石县在改造旧艺人方面是做得不坏的，他们的工作很突出，最显著的成绩就表现在离石城内烈士楼的壁画工作中。
    但离石县所以有此成绩，却不是偶然的，当地的领导者从一九四四年就开始进行改造旧艺人的工作了。当时离石属原晋绥边区三分区。一九四四年整风后，三分区就在临县召开了一个民间艺人座谈会，参加会的旧艺人除旧剧方面的和说书的盲人外，还有八位农村“画匠”。当时就把这八个搞美术的编了一组，有计划有步骤的进行了思想教育和创作教育。
    这八个“画匠”大都是贫雇农出身，社会地位是很低的，他们的手艺主要是为封建地主阶级服务。这次来参加民间艺人座谈会，由于事先不了解，他们起初是恐惧不安的。经过思想教育以后，阶级觉悟提高了，才有了新的认识。于是便开始尝试画新内容的作品。当时他们一共创作了三种年画，有“减租减息回赎土地”、“丰衣足食”、“夫妻劳军”，在这三种年画里描绘了地主的凶暴，也描绘了回赎土地及人民过丰衣足食的快乐的日子。这些画在当时据说很受群众欢迎。但那时印刷条件很差。这些画由老“画匠”秦德福用五张麻纸裱糊成夹纸抹上桐油，将图画在纸版上，用刀子挖空，也能套五色套版，用这种土印刷的方法，在政府帮助下，三种画共印出二千七百张，后来都卖完了，旧艺人们因此每人分到值一石小米的稿酬，解决了他们家庭的很多困难问题。这样在经济上给与旧艺人以新的出路，使旧艺人对于画新内容的图画有更大的信心。
    这次文艺座谈会之后，离石、临县一带的美术工作就显得特别活跃起来。如临县安业、岐道、陈庄、白文、碛口等村镇出现了很多关于生产的、对敌斗争的墙画。临县三交镇公营商店的门面上也画了很多新内容的图画。这些画大半都是参加座谈会的旧艺人画的。在这同时，为了纪念在抗日战争中牺牲的烈士们，在三交镇曾修建了一座烈士塔，塔里面用泥塑了一位人民解放军，一只脚踏住日寇，一只脚踏住汉奸。过往的行人都要到塔上去看看，觉得这种工作是有意义的。
    一九四九年四五月间离石又修建了一座烈士楼。这座烈士楼上有四十幅很大的连续壁画，都是民间艺人画的。从日寇侵占离石阎顽溃逃，一直画到一九四六年日本投降后，我军解放离石城。在当地群众中有很大的影响。
    一九四九年四月间县委与县政府及原晋绥边区三分区共同组织了一个修建烈士楼的委员会，一切工作都由这个委员会领导进行。绘画内容方面的材料也由该委员会收集。材料收集的对象是以前对敌伪阎斗争亲身参加过的人。每一件事实谈出后，须要经过县委会与县府组织的研究委员会研究。提纲也是由该委员会拟出。绘画工作是由美术工作者张彬同志领导的，画稿也大半是张彬同志起稿的，共画了四十幅。张彬同志根据提纲画好，再在研究委员会逐一研究审查，然后才往墙上画。往墙壁上画时，是两个比较画的好的画匠画的，一个叫任雨亭，三十多岁，汾阳人，现在离石柳林住，这个人的技术是画匠中比较高的；另一个叫李国治，临县人，四十多岁。张彬同志把画稿交给任李两个人后，先给讲解故事，后讲画法。工作开始后由任雨亭画东壁，由李国治画西壁，结果以东壁比西壁画的好。尤以任雨亭创作的“阎伪合流占柳林，三百民兵大围困。”和“军民夜袭卧虎湾，伪军反正作内应。”二幅画为群众所推崇。这四十幅画从农历四月开始一直画到五月下旬，共画了五十多天。整个烈士楼的工作，据说有十八个旧“画匠”，三十多个石匠参加而完成了的，一切纪念碑上的图案和花纹也都是新内容的。
    大工进行中即经常有群众来看。烈士楼工竣后，来参观的群众更多。群众看罢后，对日寇及阎蒋匪无不憎恨，甚至有大骂蒋阎匪帮的。还有些群众聚集在一起谈论着，他们谈日伪阎蒋匪如何害人，如何残杀人民；并颂扬我民兵部队及离石人民如何对敌伪英勇斗争。对画的内容上，有参加过对敌伪斗争的同志或民兵看过后，都认为没有一点虚假。有的同志与民兵一进烈士楼，就看见某幅画是他亲身参加过的，于是就对观众宣传开了。有一个多月的时间成群的观众来往不断，至今还时有上去参观的人。半年来总有六万多人来看过了。这件事是轰动了全离石与方山县中阳县一带的，后来在中阳和方山等县也接着修建了烈士楼，楼里的壁画也是由这些旧艺人画的。
    在离石烈士楼正中间有两幅像，一幅是十年内战时代中共中央委员贺昌同志的像。贺昌是离石人，后来在江西牺牲了。另一幅是前离石县长韩昌泰同志的像，同他在一起工作过的同志都说画的像。有些老乡说：“多年没见韩昌泰竟削瘦了许多！”——韩昌泰同志是一九四三年被特务害了的。
    离石烈士楼的美术工作，我是亲眼看了的，其中的壁画虽然手法上和人物的形象上还没有完全脱出旧人物画的风格，但有些场面是很生动的，而且群众是爱看的，这些画即使还有许多缺点，但由于它是旧艺人画的新内容的作品，并对群众起了相当大的教育作用，因此我们就应该重视它。这些画是旧艺人在改造过程中所走的第一步，是旧艺人通过美术为人民服务的第一步，是前进的一步，因此对于全国尚未进行改造旧艺人的地区就较有意义。就可以作为参考。
