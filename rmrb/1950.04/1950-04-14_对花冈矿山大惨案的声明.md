　　Statement on the Hanamaki Mine Massacre
　　Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles

　　The Japanese reactionaries' cruelty and inhumanity have long been world-renowned. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Pacific War, they ate prisoners of war alive, performed vivisections on prisoners of war, and used prisoners of war as experimental organisms for bacteria warfare, preparing for germ warfare. These are all undeniable facts supported by witnesses and material evidence.

　　Recently, the "Overseas Chinese Daily" published in Tokyo on January 11th revealed the truth about the Hanamaki Mine Massacre, in which the Japanese reactionaries collectively slaughtered 416 captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese laborers on the eve of their surrender. This is yet another exposure of the Japanese reactionaries' heinous crimes.

　　We believe that such massacres are by no means limited to the Hanamaki Mine incident around the time of Japan's surrender, and the number of our compatriots who were massacred is definitely not just these 416 people, but possibly more than a hundred times that number. It has been five years since Japan's surrender, and only this one incident has been exposed today. Moreover, after the truth of this massacre came to light, the Japanese side remained completely unconcerned. This is intolerable to us.

　　The handful of national traitors in Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit "delegation to Japan" who recognize the enemy as their father are not even worth mentioning. Since Japan's surrender, the Japanese reactionaries have been sheltered, condoned, and supported by American imperialism. Not only have they not been punished as they deserve, but recently they have become carried away and have brazenly resumed the posture of victors. This is especially intolerable to us.

　　Today, we solemnly declare that we must thoroughly investigate the Hanamaki Mine Massacre and similar incidents. We will absolutely not let go of Japanese war criminals, starting with Hirohito.

　　Under the shelter, condoning, and support of American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries have today conspicuously become a threat to peace in the Far East. In order to defend peace, we must awaken all Chinese compatriots and peace-loving friends around the world to further recognize the nature of imperialists in the Hanamaki Mine Massacre and the attitude taken by the American and Japanese authorities towards this massacre, and raise vigilance.

　　对花冈矿山大惨案的声明
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会主席  郭沫若
    日本反动派的残酷无人性，早就是世界有名的。在侵华战争和太平洋战争中，他们生吃战俘，用战俘施行活体解剖，用战俘作为细菌的实验生物，以作细菌战的准备，这些都是有人证物证现存、无可掩盖的事实。
    最近东京出版的“华侨民报”于一月十一日发表了日本反动派在投降前夕，集体屠杀了被俘的中国士兵及被强征的中国工人——四百一十六人的花冈矿山大惨案的真相。这是日本反动派的残酷罪行的又一次暴露。
    像这样的大惨案，我们相信，在日本投降前后，决不止花冈矿山这一次，而遭了屠杀的我国同胞也决不止这四百一十六人，可能是这个数目的一百倍以上。日本投降已经五年了，今天还只暴露了这一件。而在这一件大惨案真相大白之后，在日本方面更处之泰然。这是使我们不能容忍的。
    蒋介石残匪的所谓“驻日代表团”那一小撮认贼作父的民族败类，早就不足齿数的了。日本反动派在投降以后，一直受着美帝国主义的庇护、纵容、扶植，不仅没有受到应分的惩处，近来反而得意忘形，俨然恢复了战胜者的姿态。这尤其是使我们不能容忍的。
    我们今天要严正地声明：像花冈矿山大惨案和类似这样的事件我们一定要彻底追究，日本的战争罪犯——首先从昭和裕仁起算，我们是绝对不能放松的。
    日本反动派在美帝国主义的庇护、纵容、扶植之下，今天又显著地成为了远东和平的威胁。我们为了和平的保卫，要唤起全中国的同胞和全世界爱好和平的友人，在这花冈矿山大惨案和美日当局对这大惨案所采取的态度中，进一步地认识帝国主义者的本质，而提起警惕。
