　　Chahar Central Electricity Bureau Clears Warehouse
　　Unearths 200,000 Pieces of Equipment
　　[Our Dispatch] According to the Chahar Daily News on April 12th: The Chahar Central Electricity Bureau, under the North China Electricity Administration, has preliminarily discovered 200,000 pieces of equipment while clearing its warehouse materials. The bureau began the clearing on March 26th, and as of April 7th, the statistics for the 19 types of electrical equipment that have been cleared are as follows: single-hole porcelain cleats, double-hole porcelain cleats, 100mm small porcelain tubes, 150mm small porcelain tubes, 200mm small porcelain tubes, 300mm small porcelain tubes, 300mm medium porcelain tubes, extra-high voltage porcelain bottles, medium porcelain beads, porcelain lamp holders, small wood blocks, large wood blocks, high wood blocks, and communication porcelain bottles – the counted quantities of these 15 types of equipment exceeded the quantities listed in the accounts by 200,310 pieces (units are pieces or individual items); only the counted quantity of suspension porcelain bottles matched the quantity listed in the accounts; the counted quantities of 150mm medium porcelain tubes, 200mm medium porcelain tubes, and galvanized upright clevis porcelain bottles were 313 pieces lower than the quantities listed in the accounts.

　　The first experience the bureau gained in achieving the above results in clearing warehouse materials is that leading cadres personally took charge and were responsible. For example, the bureau director, engineers, section chiefs, etc., all personally participated in the leadership and clearing work, which enabled them to listen to the opinions of the workers in a timely manner, facilitate the timely correction of shortcomings, and at the same time, boosted work morale. Secondly, the mass line was implemented before and after the commencement of the material clearing work, and the bureau organized the study of documents and convened mobilization meetings and group meetings, truly transforming the intentions of the leadership into the actual actions of the masses. In particular, Party and League members played a backbone leading role in the work. Comrade Fu Yaoheng, a night shift worker, sacrificed his daytime rest time to participate in the warehouse clearing work. The workers all demonstrated enthusiasm and responsibility in their work. Many staff members who had not had the habit of labor in the past also worked tirelessly and without regard for dirt, just like the workers. Some comrades, afraid of miscounting, automatically recounted a second time. All the staff and workers unanimously resolved on four points of attention: (1) Obey commands; (2) Do not damage items; (3) Ensure accurate figures; (4) Do not smoke in the workplace. In order to do the work better, the Materials Clearing Committee also led the effort to run wall newspapers and hold commendation meetings to promote the work. The main shortcoming in the work was the lack of precise planning. For example, at the beginning, there was a lack of wooden boxes, straw bags, and carrying baskets, so that the items that were cleared could not be immediately packed up, sealed, and sent to the warehouse; having to pack them into bags and boxes a second time wasted another round of procedures and manpower.

　　察中电业局清查仓库
    清出器材二十万件
    【本报讯】据四月十二日察哈尔日报消息：华北电业管理局所属察中电业局清理仓库物资，初步查出器材二十万件。该局自三月二十六日开始清理，截至四月七日止，已清理完竣之十九种电业器材统计：一孔磁夹板、二孔磁夹板、一○○粍小磁管、一五○粍小磁管、二○○粍小磁管、三○○粍小磁管、三○○粍中磁管、特高压磁瓶、中磁珠、磁灯盘、小元木、大元木、高元木、通讯磁瓶十五种器材，清点数量较账列数量多出二十万零三百一十件（单位分付或个）；只有悬垂磁瓶的账列数量与清点数量相符合；一五○粍中磁管、二○○粍中磁管、锖立天切磁瓶三种器材，清点数量低于账列数量三百一十三件。
    该局清理仓库物资获得上述成绩，其第一个经验是：领导干部亲自下手负责，例如局长、工程师、股长等均亲自参加领导和清理工作，能够及时听取职工们的意见，便于及时纠正缺点，同时鼓舞了工作情绪。其次，当清点物资工作开始前后，贯彻了群众路线，组织学习文件和召开动员大会、小组会，真正使领导意图变为群众的实际行动，特别是党、团员们，在工作中起了骨干带头作用。夜班工友富耀恒同志，牺牲白天休息时间去参加仓库清理工作。职工们在工作中均表现了热情负责，许多在过去没有劳动习惯的职员，在工作中也不顾疲倦和肮脏，与工友们一样干。有的同志恐怕自己数错了数，自动的复数第二次。全体职工并一致决议四条注意事项：（一）听从指挥；（二）不打坏物品；（三）数字正确；（四）不在工作场吸烟。为了把工作搞的更好，物资清理委员会还领导办起壁报、大会表扬等鼓动工作。工作中的缺点主要是缺乏精确的计划性，例如在开始时缺乏木箱、草袋、提筐，以致清点了的东西不能随时装起来封好口还送到仓库去；待第二次装袋、装箱时，又要浪费一遍手续和人力。
