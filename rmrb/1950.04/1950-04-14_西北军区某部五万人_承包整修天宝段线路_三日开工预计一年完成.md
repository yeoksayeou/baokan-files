　　Northwest Military Region Unit of 50,000
    Undertakes Repair of Tianbao Section Railway Line
    Work Begins in Three Days, Completion Expected in One Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] A unit of the People's Liberation Army of the Northwest Military Region, comprising over 50,000 personnel, is participating in the line improvement project of the Longhai Railway's Tianshui to Baoji section. Work commenced on the 3rd of this month and is expected to be completed within one year.
    The Tianbao line was initially constructed starting in 1939. Due to corruption and embezzlement by Kuomintang officials, the construction did not meet standards, with steep gradients and loose roadbeds. After a forced completion in 1945, the roadbed was frequently washed away and collapsed during the rainy season, hence it was never officially opened to traffic. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has therefore decided to thoroughly repair and consolidate the roadbed and improve the line. Soviet experts hired by the Ministry of Railways have also personally assisted in the design of this section. The entire project involves approximately six million cubic meters of earth and stone work, and some sections of the line will also be re-routed.
    To ensure the rapid completion of this project, the Ministry of Railways formally signed a contract with the Northwest Military Region authorities last month. The Ministry of Railways will provide materials, equipment, and technical guidance, while the unit of over 50,000 personnel from the Northwest Military Region will raise its own tools and undertake the entire project. Prior to the commencement of work, the Tianbao Section Road Construction Engineering Office held a railway construction training class, and thousands of PLA commanders and fighters have already learned preliminary road construction techniques. The commanders and fighters participating in the construction project are extremely enthusiastic. Before the work began, they went up the mountains to fell trees, collect firewood, and build cave dwellings to solve accommodation problems, and actively prepare tools. All units and individuals have formulated work plans to strive for early completion of the task.

### 西北军区某部五万人  承包整修天宝段线路  三日开工预计一年完成

　　西北军区某部五万人
    承包整修天宝段线路
    三日开工预计一年完成
    【新华社十二日讯】西北军区人民解放军某部五万余人，参加陇海铁路天水至宝鸡段线路改善工程，已于本月三日开工，预计一年完成。
    天宝线系自一九三九年开始修建。由于国民党官吏贪污中饱，修建工程极不合标准，坡度大，路基松；一九四五年勉强修成后，每逢雨季，路基即被冲毁陷塌，故从未正式营业通车。中央人民政府铁道部因此决定彻底整修，巩固路基，改善线路。铁道部聘请的苏联专家并曾亲往该段协助设计。全部工程约六百万土石方，若干线路还有改线工程。
    为使这一工程迅速完成，铁道部于上月与西北军区当局正式签订合同，由铁道部供给器材、设备和技术上的指导；由西北军区某部五万余人自筹工具，承包全部工程。开工前，天宝段筑路工程处曾举办铁路修建训练班，数以千计的解放军指战员们已经学习了初步的筑路技术。参加修建工程的指战员们情绪极为高涨，在动工前，纷纷上山伐木、打柴、打窑洞以解决住宿问题，并积极准备工具。各单位和个人都纷纷拟订工作计划，争取提早完成任务。
