　　Northeast Region State-Owned Enterprises
    Remitted Profits and Depreciation to the Treasury
    First Quarter Completed One-Sixth of the Annual Budget
    Total Annual Remittance Accounts for About One-Half of the Northeast's Fiscal Revenue
    [Our Shenyang Dispatch] (Reporter Ai Fang): State-owned enterprises in the Northeast have achieved considerable success in remitting profits and depreciation to the treasury in the first quarter. According to statistics from the Northeast People's Government Finance Department in early April, the first quarter has completed 16.5 percent of the total budgeted profits and depreciation of state-owned enterprises for the entire year of 1950. It is estimated that the production volume of various factories will increase month by month and quarter by quarter in the future, and the production cost will gradually decrease, making it possible to complete an average of 25 percent of the annual total plan each quarter.
    The total amount of profits and depreciation remitted by state-owned enterprises in the Northeast accounts for about one-half of the total budgeted income of the Northeast in 1950, exceeding the sum of agricultural tax and industrial and commercial tax. Whether this task can be completed will seriously affect whether the entire Northeast budget for 1950 can be realized. The considerable amount of profit and depreciation remitted in the first quarter indicates that everyone has begun to pay attention to this issue and has gained some experience, laying a preliminary foundation for completing the annual plan in the future.

    Some Enterprises Have Failed to Complete Their Plans and Should Thoroughly Overcome Departmentalism
    Some enterprises have failed to complete their quarterly plans. For example, the actual payment of units under the Industrial Department (independent accounting units) was 82.58 percent of the original plan, and the completion rate of units under the Forestry Bureau was 77.78 percent of the original plan. There are many reasons for not completing the plan: First, the quarterly plan was formulated before the annual budget was prepared, and in some places, it did not fully conform to reality. For example, the Forestry Bureau originally planned to use timber allocation to promote the sale of more than 113,300 tons of grain for the entire profit amount, but the quarterly plan stipulated the remittance of 150,000 tons of grain. Therefore, the task could not be completed. Second, and more importantly, there are still some urgent problems to be solved in the thinking of enterprise managers and in the methods of business management. For example: (1) Some economic workers in certain enterprises adopt an attitude of remitting as little profit and depreciation as possible or delaying the remittance. They only think about keeping more money for their own turnover, without realizing that doing so will affect the entire budget revenue of the Northeast and that the state's investment in various enterprises will not be guaranteed. In the future, these departmentalist ideas, lacking an overall concept, should be thoroughly overcome, and a sound system of inspection and supervision should be established to ensure the complete realization of the remittance plan. (2) Some units do not combine production and sales well. Although the production task can be completed, the products are stockpiled and the funds are stagnant. For example, the Fushun Mining Bureau can complete and exceed its monthly production tasks, but the product backlog is serious. From the end of December last year to the end of January this year, the value of products in stock often exceeded 60 billion (more than 600 billion Northeast currency), causing capital stagnation, which affected production and, more importantly, the timely remittance of profits. The solution is to combine production and sales well. State-owned commerce should cooperate closely with industry. In addition, issues such as pricing for foreign trade are also directly related to profit remittance and need to be resolved.

　　东北区国营企业
    解缴利润及折旧入库
    第一季完成全年预算的六分之一
    全年应缴总数约占东北财政收入二分之一
    【本报沈阳讯】记者艾方报道：东北各国营企业第一季度解缴利润、折旧入库，已获相当成绩。据东北人民政府财政部四月初统计，第一季度已完成一九五零年全年所预算的国营企业利润与折旧总数的百分之十六点五。估计今后各厂生产数量将要逐月逐季增加，生产成本将要逐渐降低，每季平均完成全年总计划的百分之二十五，是有可能的。
    东北国营企业利润与折旧解缴总数，约占东北一九五零年预算总收入的二分之一，超过公粮及工商业税的总和。这一任务完成与否，将严重地影响一九五零年东北全部预算的能否实现。第一季度利润与折旧解缴已有相当数量，大家已开始重视这个问题，并取得一些经验，给今后完成全年计划打下了初步基础。
    有些企业单位未完成计划应彻底克服本位主义思想
    有些企业单位未能完成季度计划。如工业部所属各单位（独立会计单位），实缴数为原计划的百分之八十二点五八，林业局所属单位完成数为原计划的百分之七十七点七八。没有完成计划的原因很多：第一、这个季度计划是在全年预算编制之前制定的，在某些地方并不完全切合实际、如林业局第一季度预定用木材调拨以推销全部利润额的十一万三千三百余吨粮，而季度计划却规定解缴十五万吨粮。因此不能完成任务。第二、更重要的是在企业管理人员的思想中，以及在经营管理的方法上，都还有一些亟待解决的问题。如（一）某些企业单位的经济工作人员，对利润和折旧抱着尽量少缴或晚缴的态度。他们只想到自己多留几个钱周转，没有想到这样做将影响东北全部预算收入，使国家对各企业的投资没有了保证。今后应该彻底克服这些本位主义的、缺乏整体观念的思想，同时并应建立与健全检查督促制度，以保证解缴计划的完全实现。（二）某些单位生产与销售结合得不好，生产任务虽能完成，而产品积压，资金陷于停滞。如抚顺矿务局，每月生产都能完成并超过任务，但产品积压现象严重，自去年十二月底至今年一月底，经常库存产品值六百多亿（东北币六千多亿），致使资金停滞，影响了生产，更影响利润按时解缴。解决的办法是产销很好结合。国营商业应和工业密切配合起来。此外，对对外贸易的作价等问题，也是直接与解缴利润有关的问题，需要获得解决。
