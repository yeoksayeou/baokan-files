[Reported by Nanjing Xinhua Daily] In the struggle to overcome current difficulties in industry and commerce and to maintain and transform production, the majority of workers in private enterprises in Nanjing have lowered their living standards and actively provided various forms of assistance to capitalists. Last winter, shop assistants in private commercial establishments generally launched a movement to reduce wages to help capitalists. Employees of 57 department stores voluntarily reduced their salaries, with the largest reduction being 70% and the smallest being 10%. Employees of 11 stores even waived their year-end double pay last year. Employees of 41 silk and cloth shops reduced their salaries to 95% to 40% of their original wages. Owners and employees of sauce gardens reached a four-month agreement at the end of last year, stipulating that shops with more than three employees would adopt a rotating shift system of working 20 days (without pay on off-days), reducing one-third of the employer's expenses each month. Shops with three or fewer employees would reduce salaries by 60% to 15% respectively, and meals would be changed from two rice meals and one congee with meat and vegetables to two congee meals and one rice meal with two vegetarian dishes. Working hours would remain the same at thirteen hours. One tea merchant, greatly harmed by the devaluation of the Kuomintang's bogus gold yuan notes, could no longer sustain the business. To help the employer maintain operations, the store's eleven employees not only gave up their salaries but also lent the employer more than 40 million yuan of their accumulated savings. Workers at the private Pufeng Flour Mill voluntarily reduced their salaries by more than 40% last November and promoted assistance to the employer in purchasing raw materials in northern Jiangsu. Workers at the Capital Match Factory voluntarily reduced their wages by 30%, while productivity increased by 100% compared to before liberation. Workers at the Jinlan Biscuit Factory took turns resting in three shifts, reducing one-third of the employer's expenses each month. Cotton textile workers almost universally took no wages. As a result of the workers reducing wages, practicing thrift, and vigorously assisting the capitalists, the confidence of the capitalists in maintaining and operating their businesses was greatly enhanced. The Pufeng Flour Mill, which had been on the verge of shutting down, continued operations with the help of workers in purchasing raw materials and reducing wages. The Capital Match Factory, which was originally unable to sustain itself, not only maintained normal production but also had a surplus after the employer increased investment and operations due to the workers' efforts. For the sake of long-term interests, the workers endured current difficulties. For example, Zheng Xinjiang, an employee of a tea shop, could not receive his salary, so he repeatedly wrote letters to his family, informing them to reclaim wasteland for production to solve the problem of livelihood. Wang Yousheng, chairman of the bathhouse trade union, maintained his family life by having his wife sell vegetables. It is worth noting that this spirit of sacrifice by the workers, who took the overall situation into consideration, has been exploited by some cunning capitalists. Seeing that the employees voluntarily reduced their salaries, they not only did not welcome it but continued to withdraw capital, and further put forward various unreasonable demands, or deliberately complained and were not actively engaged in business. The workers have gained valuable experience from this: helping capitalists must be combined with the actual situation and carried out on the basis of certain conditions agreed upon by the capitalists. Otherwise, it would violate the policy of mutual benefit between labor and capital and would not achieve the goal of maintaining and restoring production.

### 南京工人协助资方克服困难维持生产

　　南京工人协助资方克服困难维持生产
    【本报讯】据南京新华日报消息：在克服工商业目前的困难，维持改造生产的斗争中，南京大多数私营企业工人，降低了生活水平，主动地给予资方各种帮助。去年冬天，私营商业的店员们就普遍展开减薪帮助资方运动。有五十七家百货业店员自动减薪，其中减得最多的是三折，减得最少的是九折，还有十一家的店员于去年减免年终双薪。有四十一家绸布业的店员将薪金减成九五折以至四折。酱园业主雇双方在去年年底订立了四个月的协议，规定凡有三个以上店员的店家，采取工作二十天的轮班制，（息班日不领工资）每月替资方减少三分之一的开支。三人以下的店家，以四折至八五折分别减薪，并将伙食由二饭一粥、一荤一素，改为二粥一饭和二个素菜。工作时间则仍按照原来的十三小时。有一家茶商，被国民党的伪金圆券贬值搅得大伤元气，现已不能支持。该店十一个店员为了帮助资方维持下去，除放弃薪金外，并将多时积蓄的薪金四千余万元借予资方。私营普丰面粉厂职工于去年十一月自动将薪金减低百分之四十以上，并推动帮助资方赴苏北采购原料。首都火柴厂工人自动减低工资百分之三十，生产力则比解放前提高一倍。金兰饼干厂工人分三班轮流休息，每月减轻资方三分之一的开支。棉织业工人几乎全不取工资。工人弟兄减低工薪、厉行节约、大力帮助资方的结果，大大增强了资方维持和经营的信心。普丰面粉厂原已趋于停工，经工人帮助采购原料与减低工资，已继续开工。首都火柴厂本已不能支持，由于工人的推动，资方增资经营后，不仅能正常维持生产，并且还有了盈余。为了长远的利益，工人弟兄忍受了目前的困难。如茶业店员郑心江拿不到薪金，就一再写信通知家庭开荒生产，来解决生活问题。浴堂业工会主席王有声的妻子以卖小菜来维持家庭生活。值得注意的是，工人弟兄这种顾全大局的牺牲精神，却被某些刁滑的资方钻了空子。他们看到职工自动减薪，不但不表示欢迎，竟不断抽取资本，并进一步提出种种不合理的要求，或者故意叫苦不积极经营。工人弟兄们已从中获得了宝贵的经验：帮助资方一定要结合实际情况，在资方答允了的一定条件上进行。否则，就要违背劳资两利政策，就不能达到维持和恢复生产的目的。
