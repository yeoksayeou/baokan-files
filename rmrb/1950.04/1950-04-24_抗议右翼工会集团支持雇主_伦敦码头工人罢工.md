　　Protesting Right-Wing Union Group's Support for Employers
    London Dockworkers Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd] London dockworkers went on strike on the 19th to protest the right-wing group controlling the Transport and General Workers' Union, which refused to reinstate three workers who were fired for leading the London dockworkers' strike in support of Canadian dockworkers last year. The strike has rapidly expanded. According to a Telecommunications Agency report, the strike had "increased to about 8,000 people" by the 21st. On the first day of the strike, ninety ships in the port and about two hundred freight trucks on shore were brought to a standstill, "paralyzing half of the Port of London" (Reuters). The decision to strike was passed at a mass meeting and immediately telegraphed to all docks, regardless of whether the union authorities approved it. The resolution passed at the meeting also condemned the attitude of the union "leaders" as an attack on the living standards of dockworkers, and denounced them for "supporting employers at the expense of workers who support strikes." The strike is now expanding. Facing this situation, Attlee hurriedly convened a cabinet meeting on the evening of the 21st to discuss suppression measures and prepare to deploy troops to the docks.

　　抗议右翼工会集团支持雇主
    伦敦码头工人罢工
    【新华社二十三日讯】伦敦码头工人已于十九日罢工，以抗议控制运输及各业工人工会的右翼集团，该集团拒绝恢复因去年领导伦敦码头工人支援加拿大码头工人的罢工而被开除的三名工人的职务。罢工已迅速扩大。据电通社消息，罢工至二十一日已“增至八千人左右”。罢工第一天就使港中九十只船和岸上约二百辆运货车陷于停顿，“使伦敦港口瘫痪了一半”（路透社）。罢工的决定系在一群众大会上通过的，不顾工会当局批准与否，就立即以电报传遍一切码头。大会通过的决议并谴责工会“领袖”的态度为对码头工人生活标准的进攻，斥责他们“支持雇主牺牲拥护罢工的工人”。罢工现正在扩大中。面临着这种情势，艾德礼已于二十一日晚慌忙召开内阁大臣会议，商讨镇压措施，并准备调动军队到码头上去。
