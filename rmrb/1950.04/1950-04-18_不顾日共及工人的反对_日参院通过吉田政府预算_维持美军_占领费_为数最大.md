Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: Despite opposition from the Japanese Communist Party and workers, the Japanese Diet, under pressure from U.S.-Japan reactionaries, has passed the Yoshida government's budget for the 1950 fiscal year (from April 1st of this year to March 31st of next year). According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch: the Yoshida government's general budget for this year has both revenues and expenditures amounting to over 661.4 billion yen (the official exchange rate between the yen and the U.S. dollar is 360 to 1). The largest single item of expenditure is still the "occupation fee" for maintaining the U.S. occupation forces, totaling over 109 billion yen, accounting for about one-sixth of the total budget. On the other hand, the Yoshida government resolutely refused to increase the salaries of government employees in the budget.

The Japanese Communist Party has consistently and firmly opposed the budget proposal of the Yoshida government, which serves the monopoly capitalist groups. JCP Diet members withdrew from the House Budget Committee on March 8th to protest. JCP Senator Shigeharu Nakano criticized this budget proposal, which had been pre-approved by MacArthur's headquarters, in the Diet on the 7th of this month, intending to turn Japan into a foreign military base and colony. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch: During the Diet's discussion of the budget proposal, workers demonstrated and marched almost every day to oppose the passage of the budget.

Under the influence of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people, reactionary opposition parties such as the right-wing Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Party also had to express some opposition to the budget proposal. In the House of Representatives, the Yoshida government relied on its overwhelming majority of seats to pass the budget proposal as early as March 15th. However, in the Senate, which it could not completely control, the budget proposal was delayed in its passage. It was not until April 3rd that the Senate barely passed it by a vote of 104 to 95.

### 不顾日共及工人的反对  日参院通过吉田政府预算  维持美军“占领费”为数最大

　　不顾日共及工人的反对
    日参院通过吉田政府预算
    维持美军“占领费”为数最大
    【新华社十七日讯】日本吉田政府所提出的一九五○年会计年度（自今年四月一日起，至明年三月三十一日止）预算，在美日反动派的压力下，业经日本议会通过。据合众社东京讯：吉田政府今年度的一般预算收支两方均为六千六百十四亿余日元（按日元对美元的官定汇率为三百六十比一）。支出中的最大一项，仍为维持美国占领军的“占领费”，共达一千零九十亿日元以上，约占总预算的六分之一。但另一方面，吉田政府在预算中却坚决拒绝增加政府职工的工资。
    日本共产党自始就坚决反对吉田政府为垄断资本集团服务的预算案，日共众议员于三月八日退出众院预算委员会以示抗议。日共参议员中野繁治本月七日在国会中抨击这一事先经过麦克阿瑟总部批准的预算案，打算将日本沦为外国的军事基地与殖民地。据合众社东京电称：在国会讨论预算案期间，几乎每天都有工人示威游行，反对通过预算。
    日本右翼社会民主党和民主党等反动在野党派，在日共和日本人民的影响下，也不得不对预算案表示某种反对。在众议院，吉田政府依赖其压倒多数的议席，早在三月十五日即通过了预算案。但在其未能完全操纵的参议院，预算案却迟迟未获通过。直至四月三日，参院始以一百零四票对九十五票，勉强予以通过。
