(Beijing News Agency Dispatch) The Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the "Beijing Municipality's Decision on Relief of Unemployed Workers (Trial Implementation Details)," has begun handling the relief of unemployed workers and the collection of relief funds and foundations from public and private factories and workshops with more than ten people in this city since February of this year. In the process of implementing the relief details, some factory workers have misunderstandings or are not very clear about Article 13 of the details regarding "Unemployed workers receiving relief money, when there is a job opportunity, should be introduced by the Labor Bureau or find employment on their own; those who have employment opportunities but refuse to be employed without reason will be considered employed." Therefore, Wan Yi, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, made the following explanations:

	I. When the Labor Bureau introduces unemployed workers receiving relief money to employment, it will definitely take into account the workers' own skills, physical strength, and other conditions. As for technical workers in some declining industries, they must be assisted in appropriate career changes; and employees who are introduced to employment may appeal to the Labor Bureau with reasons if they have special difficulties or reasons. However, those who intend to enjoy relief without working and refuse to be employed without reason will be considered employed.

	II. Before being employed, that is, during the period of receiving relief money, unemployed workers can find some temporary jobs, except for government-organized participation in public works semi-voluntary labor. For those who have intermittent work and no fixed income, the government can still issue relief money as usual.

	III. Unemployed workers who are being relieved, if they have relatively fixed temporary jobs and continue for more than a month, will not be treated as employed before the employment relationship is fixed. However, if they have worked for a month and received a full month's salary, the relief money for that month will be stopped. If the temporary work is terminated, they can continue to receive unemployment relief money. As for how long temporary work continues to be considered employment, before the government has unified regulations on the issue of temporary workers, it must be handled according to the specific situation, but in principle, it is only when workers have a fixed job that they can be considered employed.

	IV. Unemployed workers who have been dismissed, if they are willing to return to their hometown to engage in agricultural production, or go to other areas to find employment on their own, with the certification of the trade union of their industry, the government can issue a certain amount of relief money at one time as travel expenses according to their actual situation. However, the employee will no longer be able to continue to enjoy unemployment relief in the future.

　　对于京市救济失业员工试行细则第十三条的几点解释
    市劳动局副局长  万一
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府劳动局根据《北京市救济失业员工决定试行细则》的规定，已自本年二月份起开始办理本市十人以上之公私营工厂作坊的失业员工救济及征收救济金、基金的工作，在执行救济细则的过程中，有些工厂的工人对该细则第十三条关于“领取救济金之员工，有工作机会时，由劳动局介绍或自行就业；有就业机会而无故拒绝就业者以就业论”的规定有所误解或不甚明了，为此，劳动局万一副局长，特作如下解释：
    一、领取救济金之失业员工，劳动局在介绍其就业时，一定会照顾到员工本身的技术、体力及其他方面的条件，至于有些没落行业的技术员工，则须协助其适当转业；而被介绍就业的员工，如有特殊困难或原因，也可向劳动局申述理由。但意图不劳动坐享救济，而无故拒绝就业者，则以就业论。
    二、在没有就业前，即在领取救济金期间内的失业员工，除政府组织其参加公共工程半义务劳动外，可以找些临时性的工作。其因工作间断，无固定收入者，政府仍可照发救济金。
    三、被救济的失业员工，有了比较固定的临时性工作，且连续到一个月以上，在雇佣关系没有固定之前，仍不按就业处理。但工作了一个月并领得整月工资的，该月份的救济金即行停发。如果临时性工作中止，仍可继续领取失业救济金。至于临时性工作连续到多长时间就算就业一点，在政府对临时工问题未统一规定之前，得按具体情况处理，但原则上是在工人有了固定工作之后，才能算是就业。
    四、被解雇后的失业员工，如愿回乡从事农业生产，或去其他地区自谋职业者，经本行业的工会证明后，政府按其实际情况，可一次发给若干救济金，作为路费。但以后该员就不能再继续享受失业救济。
