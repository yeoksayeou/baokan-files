Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: TASS Moscow, 15th dispatch: The Labor Daily, in a review of the international labor movement, discussed the victorious progress of the signature campaign for the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's Appeal (which calls for the prohibition of atomic weapons and warns that any government that uses such weapons first will be regarded as a war criminal).

The observer, Jie Mentiev, wrote: Millions of people who are very enthusiastic about peace have already responded to this call. In the people's democratic countries, the signature collection campaign has already begun. In the great People's Republic of China, a meeting has been held for the Stockholm Conference of the Standing Committee. In capitalist countries, the campaign to collect signatures for the Standing Committee's appeal is being widely carried out. In Italy, the Netherlands, West Germany, and other Marshall Plan countries, the signature campaign has been launched with mass rallies and demonstrations. News from across the ocean (where progressive workers and intellectuals are the pioneers of the peace movement) talks about the Standing Committee's appeal being endorsed by the broad masses of the people.

The observer emphasized that the peace front is shifting to a more resolute and effective way of fighting against the instigators of a new war. In addition to the achievements of the signature collection campaign, this is also evidenced by the growing wave of strikes in many ports in Europe and Africa to sabotage the delivery of American weapons to the signatory countries of the aggressive North Atlantic Group. The observer also paid tribute to the glorious heroism and unwavering steadfastness shown by dockworkers and sailors in Italy, France, Trieste, the Netherlands, Belgium, West Germany, Norway, and other places.

　　和大呼吁书签名运动受到千百万人民拥护
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：劳动报在一篇国际劳工运动述评中，论述世界拥护和平大会常设委员会呼吁书（该呼吁书号召禁止原子武器并警告首先使用这种武器的政府将被视为战犯）签名运动胜利进行的情形。
    观察家杰门捷夫写道：数以百万计的非常热心于和平的人们，已经响应了这一号召。在人民民主国家中，征集签名运动已经开始了。在伟大的中华人民共和国，已为常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议举行了会议。在资本主义国家中，为常设委员会呼吁书征集签名的运动，正在广泛地展开着。在意大利、荷兰、西德及其他马歇尔化国家里，以群众大会和示威游行展开了签名运动。自大洋彼岸（那里进步的工人与知识分子是和平运动的先驱）传来的消息，谈到常设委员会的呼吁书受到了广大人民的拥护。
    观察家强调称：和平阵线正在转入更坚决、更有效地反对新战争挑拨者的斗争方式。除征集签名运动所获得的成就之外，在欧洲和非洲许多港口，为破坏将美国武器交运至侵略性的北大西洋集团各签字国而掀起的日益增长的罢工浪潮中，也证明了这一点。观察家并对意大利、法国、的里雅斯特、荷兰、比利时、西德、挪威及其他地方的码头工人与海员正表现出的光辉的英勇与坚贞不屈表示敬意。
