Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th: The main products of Taiyuan's public industries have mostly completed and exceeded the production plans for the first quarter of this year. Rolled steel exceeded the plan by 23.24 percent, coal by 21 percent, and refractory materials by 7.82 percent. Other products such as coke, chemical industry products, tobacco, flour, and leather also exceeded production plans. Production of electricity, cotton yarn, paper, cement, and matches were close to fulfilling plans. Products such as iron and steel did not complete the plans. This was mainly caused by the following reasons: First, some factories and mines have deficiencies in their management, and cannot consolidate or continue to improve the production achievements they have obtained, resulting in fluctuating production capacity. For example, the Northwest Iron and Steel Company created a new record in November last year, with iron production increasing by one time compared to before, but this record was not maintained. As a result, the iron smelting volume in the first quarter of this year only completed 63 percent of the production plan. Secondly, there were obstacles in power supply during the first quarter. The power company only completed slightly more than 92 percent of its original power generation plan for the quarter; and when the power equipment in the steel plant failed, the power company stopped supplying power to some secondary factories and mines in order to supply power to the steel plant, which in turn affected the cement and other factories from fully completing their plans.

　　太原公营工业
    大部超过第一季生产计划
    部分工矿经营管理有缺陷生产能力忽高忽低
    【新华社太原十二日电】太原市公营工业主要产品大部已完成并超过了今年第一季的生产计划。轧钢超过计划的百分之二三点二四，煤炭超过计划的百分之二十一，耐火材料超过百分之七点八二；他如焦炭、化学工业产品、烟草、面粉、皮革等，亦均超过了生产计划。接近完成计划的有发电、纱布、纸张、洋灰、火柴等。铁、钢等产品，则未完成计划。这主要是由以下原因造成的：一是某些厂矿在经营管理工作中有缺陷，不能巩固或继续提高已获得的生产成绩，以致生产能力或高或低。如西北钢铁公司去年十一月份炼铁产量曾创造较前提高一倍的新纪录，但这一纪录未能保持下来，结果今年第一季的炼铁量只完成生产计划的百分之六十三。其次是第一季度中动力供应曾发生过障碍，电业公司本季发电量只完成原计划的百分之九十二强；而在炼钢厂的动力设备发生故障时，电力公司为了供给该厂的电力，又曾停止了对某些次要厂矿的供电，于是又影响了洋灰等厂计划没有全部完成。
