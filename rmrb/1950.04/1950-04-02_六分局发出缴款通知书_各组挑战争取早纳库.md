　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Office] The tax payment notices for the second half of 1949 industrial and commercial tax for all industrial and commercial businesses in the Sixth Precinct's jurisdiction were all issued as of yesterday (1st). Prior to the delivery of the payment notices, mobilization meetings were held in various districts, calling on industrial and commercial businesses to pay early.

　　In the Fengtai district, the mobilization method was to divide all industrial and commercial businesses into four large groups according to the nature of their industry, with each group competing in a challenge to be the first to pay into the treasury. One group immediately challenged the other groups, guaranteeing to pay all taxes into the treasury before the 15th. One group accepted the challenge, and the other two groups also guaranteed that the vast majority of taxes would be paid into the treasury before the 15th.

　　In the Nanyuan district, when the mobilization meeting was held, the merchants present were in high spirits and guaranteed to pay early. Within twenty minutes of the delivery of the payment notices, the Dianhua Barber Shop paid all its taxes, saying, "We prepared the funds during the assessment." Within two hours, the Lihua Lumber Mill also paid all its taxes of more than 1.3 million yuan.

　　Suo Yutang, the manager of Xin Dalu, the leader of the rubber industry group outside Guang'anmen, has always taken the lead in paying and promoting other industrial and commercial businesses during each industrial and commercial tax collection. This time, he returned to his hometown in Shandong for personal reasons during the assessment, but he bought one hundred catties of rice coupons in advance and sent a letter from home telling the counter staff to prepare the tax money early. Therefore, the company paid all its taxes the day after receiving the payment notice (March 31st). (Tax Sixth Communications Group)

　　六分局发出缴款通知书
    各组挑战争取早纳库
    【京市新闻处讯】税务六分局辖区各工商户一九四九年下半年工商业税的缴款通知书，截至昨（一）日止，已全部发出。在缴款书送达以前，各地区都召开了动员大会，号召工商户早缴。
    丰台地区的动员方式是将全体工商户按行业性质分成四个大组，各组用挑战方式争取早日纳库。当场就有一组首先向各组挑战，保证十五日前全部纳库。一组应战，其他二组也保证十五日前绝大部分纳库。
    南苑地区在开动员大会的时候，到会商人情绪高涨，纷纷保证早缴。送达缴款书二十分钟内，殿华理发馆就将全部税款缴到，并且说：“我们早在评议的时候，就准备了款”。二小时内，又有利华木厂将全部税款一百三十多万元缴清。
    广安门外橡胶工业小组长新大陆经理索玉堂，在历次征收工商业税的时候，都带头先缴并能推动其他工商户。这次在评议时，他因事回山东原籍，事先就买了一百斤折米券，并从家中来信告诉柜上早日准备税款。所以该号在收到缴款书的次日（三月三十一日）就将全部税款缴清了。（税六通讯组）
