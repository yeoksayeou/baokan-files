　　The People’s Daily reports that the following experiences have been gained in the production and disaster relief work in the heavily affected areas of Hebei Province over the past six months:
    (1) Organize the masses to engage in various types of sideline production. Experience over the past six months has proven that in organizing the masses for sideline production, we must first make detailed and practical calculations on the ground, help them find ways to produce, and make plans for self-reliance through production. At the same time, we must also help the masses solve the difficulties of raw materials and tools for production, such as cotton for weaving and fishing gear. And pay attention to organizing them, conducting production in a planned and targeted manner. When sideline production has already begun to be organized, we should help solve the problem of sales, adopt the form of signing contracts, organize the transportation, consignment sales, and purchase of products, and mobilize the masses as much as possible to promote retail sales through various relationships. In sideline production, we must also pay attention to the transfer of seasonal sideline production, and organize the transfer to other industries as early as possible when it is not possible to produce (such as when it is not possible to boil saltpeter after freezing), so as to avoid production disconnection. Finally, we must be good at using the income from sideline production to persist in and expand sideline production, and should pay attention to combining it with various preparations for agricultural production.
    (2) All economic departments should do their best to help the masses produce. Cooperatives and specialized companies should correct the purely profit-oriented view and appropriately adjust purchase prices to make them fair, reasonable, and mutually beneficial to both public and private sectors. Government and civilian cadres should also overcome the purely relief-oriented view, such as forcing cooperatives to buy substandard goods at high prices. Specialized companies should closely integrate with cooperatives and rely on cooperatives to supply the masses with food, raw materials, and purchase their products, so as to support their business at reasonable prices.
    (3) Seize the opportunity to distribute relief grain. Good experiences in implementing this task include: conducting prior investigations, convening district and village people's representative conferences, explaining the rationale, and determining the principles and methods of distribution. In particular, it is important to make the process of grain distribution a process of organizing production. Some places have not done this, resulting in egalitarianism and waste.
    Based on the current situation, the disaster areas of Hebei are continuing to implement the following tasks:
    (1) Continue to implement the policy of production for disaster relief, strengthen inspection and specific organization, and through people's representative conferences and work teams, drive the vast number of village cadres and the masses to implement careful calculation and planning from house to house, which is the key to further improving the current disaster relief work.
    (2) Take care of overall production work, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, focusing on the heavily affected areas, but not neglecting the lightly affected areas. Develop sideline occupations to solve the immediate difficulties of disaster victims, and at the same time, pay attention to leading spring plowing preparations. We should be alert to the prolongation of the disaster, urgently drain water, and strive to sow early, plant a large number of early-maturing crops and vegetables, and advocate thrift and savings. Mobilize revolutionary martyrs' families, disabled soldiers, the elderly and the weak to carry out possible production. Start the spring work on river defenses as early as possible, and enable the masses to use the income from river defense spring work directly to help spring plowing. Continue to strengthen cooperatives, continue to mobilize dead assets into living assets, to facilitate production. However, it is necessary to prevent random demolition of houses and indiscriminate felling of trees, and ensure that existing grain funds are used for production. Check the distribution of relief grain and publicize production policies through people's representative conferences at all levels.
    (3) Disaster area primary schools should be supported as much as possible to minimize closures. During the spring plowing season, special attention must be paid to disease prevention and treatment to protect the health of disaster victims to facilitate production.
    Because these tasks are derived from summarizing past experience and are completely in line with the current situation in the disaster areas, all cadres are working hard to implement them.

　　河北重灾区生产救灾经验及目前进行的三项工作
    【本报讯】河北省重灾区在半年来的生产救灾工作中，取得如下经验：
    （一）组织群众进行各种各样的副业生产。半年来经验证明：在组织群众副业生产时，首先应具体实地的精打细算，帮助他们找出生产门道，作出生产自救的计划。同时还要帮助群众解决生产上的原料、工具等困难，如纺织的棉花及治鱼工具等。并注意将其组织起来，有计划有目标地进行生产。在副业生产已开始组织起来时，就应帮助解决销路问题，采用订合同形式，组织产品的外运、代销、收购，并尽可能发动群众，通过各种关系零星推销。副业生产中，还须注意有季节性副业生产的转业问题，到不能生产的季节（如结冻后不能熬皮硝等），及早组织转业，以免生产脱节。最后要善于运用副业所得，坚持与扩展副业生产，并应注意结合进行农业生产的各项准备。
    （二）各经济部门应尽大力扶助群众生产。合作社与各专业公司应纠正单纯营利观点，适当调整收购价格，使之公平合理，公私互利。而政民干部也应克服单纯救济观点，如硬要合作社高价收买次货等作法。专业公司应与合作社密切结合，并依托合作社供应群众粮食、原料，收购群众产品，以合理价格扶助其业务。
    （三）抓紧时机发放赈粮。在执行这一工作中好的经验是：事先调查，召开区村人民代表会，讲明道理，并定出发放原则与办法。特别要注意的是使发粮过程，成为组织生产的过程。有些地方没有这样做，发生了平均主义及浪费等毛病。
    依据当前情况，河北灾区正继续贯彻以下工作：
    （一）继续贯彻生产救灾方针，加强检查与具体的组织工作，通过人民代表会及工作组，带动广大村干部与群众，实行精打细算，挨门逐户订计划，这是当前救灾工作进一步提高的关键。
    （二）照顾全面生产工作，农副业结合，面向重灾区，但不忽视轻灾区。发展副业解决灾民眼前困难，同时当前要注意领导春耕准备。应警惕灾荒延长，急起排水，争取早日脱地播种，大量种植早熟作物及菜蔬，提倡节约储蓄。发动烈军工属老弱，进行可能的生产。河防春工及早动手，并使群众将河防春工所得，直接有助于春耕。继续加强合作社，继续动员将死财变活财，以利生产。但须防止乱拆房屋、滥伐树木，保证现有粮款用于生产。检查赈粮的发放，并通过各级人民代表会宣传生产政策。
    （三）灾区小学，应尽量支持争取少停。春耕期间尤须注意防疫治病，保护灾民健康以利生产。
    由于这些工作是从总结过去经验中得来，而又完全切合灾区目前情况，因此全体干部正以全力贯彻。
