　　Philippine Liberation Army's Major Offensive Achieves Important Victory, Capturing Cities and Heavily Damaging Garrison Troops
    Philippine Reactionaries and Their American Masters are Alarmed and Uneasy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Second dispatch] A large-scale offensive launched by the Philippine People's Liberation Army to celebrate the eighth anniversary of its founding has achieved an important victory. According to a Singapore telecommunications agency report on March 30: a large number of Philippine People's Liberation Army forces have captured several cities very close to Manila in the past few days. In the battles to attack four cities within fifty miles of Manila, the garrison troops suffered heavy casualties. In some areas, Liberation Army forces numbering up to one thousand engaged in fierce battles with Philippine government garrison troops and the army. The Liberation Army also briefly occupied San Pablo City (located forty-three miles southeast of Manila). Many cities in the provinces of Laguna, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija have also been liberated. The Liberation Army has also launched attacks in Batangas province. According to a United Press report, thousands of Liberation Army soldiers attacked the Montalban area of Rizal province, about twenty miles southeast of Manila. Another Liberation Army team also entered Clemente City in Tarlac province on the evening of March 31.
    The offensive launched by the Philippine People's Liberation Army has alarmed and disturbed the Philippine reactionaries and their American masters. According to a United Press report, Manila is in a state of panic, and the police have "guarded all entrances and exits of the city hall." "Only one main door of the city hall is open, and the back door and side doors are closed." Police Chief Quinto stated, "The police are prepared to deal with any emergency." According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 1st, MacArthur and his staff are "closely watching" the "current development of the situation in the Philippines."

    菲反动派及其美国主子惊慌不安
    【新华社二日讯】菲律宾人民解放军为庆祝建军八周年纪念所展开的大规模攻势，已获得重要胜利。据电通社新加坡三月三十日消息：大量的菲律宾人民解放军，在过去几天内曾攻占马尼拉周围很近的若干城市。在进攻马尼拉周围五十英里的四座城市的战役中，警备队方面遭受重大损伤。在若干地区，实力达一千人的解放军，曾与菲政府警备队和陆军进行激战。解放军并曾一度占领圣巴布洛城（位于马尼拉东南四十三英里）。在拉古纳、班邦加和鲁瓦·伊西加各省，也有许多城市被解放。解放军还曾在八打雁省发动攻击。又据合众社消息称：数以千计的解放军，曾进攻马尼拉东南约二十英里的利扎尔省的曼亭鲁巴地区。另队解放军并于三月三十一日晚攻入塔拉克省的克利门特城。
    菲人民解放军所发动的这一攻势，使菲律宾反动派及其美国主子惊慌不安。据合众社报道：马尼拉城已惶惶不安，警察已“把守市政府的所有进出口”，“市政府仅一个大门开着，后门和边门都已关闭”，警察长昆托斯声称：“警察已准备应付任何紧急事变”。另据合众社东京一日消息称：麦克阿瑟及其属员“正密切注视”“目前菲律宾形势的发展”。
