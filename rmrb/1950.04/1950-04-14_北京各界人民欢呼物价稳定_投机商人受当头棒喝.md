　　People from All Walks of Life in Beijing Cheer for Price Stability
    Speculative Merchants Receive a Head-on Blow
    [Reported by our newspaper] People from all walks of life in Beijing are delighted with the stable and falling prices and have expressed their opinions in support of the people's government's policy of stabilizing prices.
    Workers
    During the reactionary Kuomintang rule, the workers suffered the most from price fluctuations. For example, Kang Zhongtai, a worker at the Beijing Clothing Factory, could buy four bags of flour with his monthly salary at the beginning of the Kuomintang reactionaries' first "currency reform," but a month later, he could not even buy one bag. After the liberation of Beijing, although prices fluctuated several times, the people's government adopted the method of calculating workers' wages in kind, ensuring that workers received their wages according to the price index every month; at the same time, due to the organization of cooperatives in various factories, they could buy the daily necessities they needed, such as grain, within three days, without being affected by price increases. Judging from the issue of price fluctuations, workers received different treatment due to the difference between the two social systems. Today, when prices across the country have stabilized, and the workers recall the suffering of the past Kuomintang period, their joy is undoubtedly increased. Because after liberation, although the lives of workers have been guaranteed, they still had to rush to the cooperative to buy grain after receiving their wages, suffering from crowding; and often delaying production time. And the purchase of oil, salt and other items in the market was still affected by rising prices. Today is different, workers receive their wages and are not afraid of price fluctuations, and can buy goods at their leisure. As worker Kang Zhongtai said: Although our workers receive in-kind wages, we are very happy about this price stability; we can also produce more with peace of mind. Ji Wenxue, an installer at the Dazhong Electrical Appliance Store in Liulichang, said: "With stable prices, our business is easier to do! In the past, when prices rose sharply, we couldn't fix a price. The price we agreed on was worthless when we got the money. Now it’s not so nerve-wracking to set prices."
    When the Japanese devils invaded and occupied Beijing, rickshaw pullers had no food for the next day. They pulled rickshaws during the day and lined up at night to squeeze in for "mixed flour." During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, prices rose every day. With their daily labor income, when they went to buy grain in the evening, the grain stores had already "deducted the bran"; the next day, "overnight deposits" were greatly discounted. Now that prices are stable, the lives of rickshaw pullers, like other working people, have also stabilized. A rickshaw puller earns an average of seven or eight thousand yuan a day, which is no problem to support three or four people. Li Jingxiang of the Rickshaw and Foreign Car Union said: "When prices rise, the price of pulling a rickshaw can never keep up with the rise in grain prices; if we ask for too much, people won't ride, so we have to reduce the price. When prices rise, we who sell our labor are out of luck. Now that prices are stable, the money we earn in a day can definitely buy the grain we deserve, so we don't have to worry all day long."
    Teachers and Students
    Regarding the gradual stabilization of prices, the majority of educators and students in Beijing unanimously believe that this is something that has never happened and is impossible in the past many years, and it can only be achieved under the correct financial and economic policies of the people's government. This change has directly caused repercussions in their lives: In the past, teachers and staff members rushed to buy things when they received their salaries, fearing that they would suffer if they bought them late. "Now, no one has to worry about that! There is no need to consider whether you will suffer or not when you put the money in your pocket!" This is the conclusion that Liu Fuzhou, a teacher at the Municipal No. 2 Middle School, and Yang Jianzhang and Chen Jiebai, teachers at Huiven Middle School, have experienced from their own lives. In the students' mess halls, in the past, whenever a batch of food expenses was received, they quickly bought flour and ordered a large amount of goods from oil and salt stores. Even so, the food committee members were still worried every day that they would not be able to provide meals by the end of the month. Now the food committee members no longer have this concern. Due to the stability and fall of prices, the No. 2 Middle School's dining group ate five or six eggs, fried tofu, meat, and two steamed buns each when they settled the meal this time. This had never happened in No. 2 Middle School. Xu Jiuru, a worker at Huiven Middle School, used to eat only pickles with his meals, but now he can eat some other dishes. When Deputy Director of Instruction Tao Qi asked him about it, he said with a smile: "Although our salaries have not increased, Chairman Mao's policies have allowed me to improve my life!"
    Zhao Xianzhou, a resident of No. 13 Da'an South Palace, said: "Today, the people's government has brought the profiteers under control. Profiteers have never been satisfied with making small money, and often create disturbances and raise prices. But today we can also straighten our backs and live a good life for a couple of days!" Zhang Meiqing, a housewife who is now engaged in hosiery sideline, said: "I am very happy that prices have fallen, and I can eat more vegetables every meal. Our people's government really has a way!"
    Industrial and Commercial Circles
    Price stability has increased the good conditions for the recovery and development of legitimate industry and commerce. Liu Yifeng from the Beijing industrial and commercial circles said: "If prices do not fluctuate, legitimate industry and commerce will be guaranteed a certain profit and can develop steadily." Since the Anti-Japanese War, prices have risen linearly. If general industry and commerce calculated profits and losses in monetary figures, they would obtain profits of tens of thousands of times; but in reality, they could not replenish the goods they sold, and the inventory in the warehouse decreased day by day. Before 1937, Ruifuxiang, the largest silk and cloth store in Beijing, always maintained an inventory of more than 10,000 bolts of cloth, but now it only has more than 2,000 bolts left. Jiao Huanwu, the manager of the store, said: The inventory has decreased year by year because after selling the goods, they cannot buy the same amount of goods due to the impact of soaring prices. Now that prices are stable, the situation is different. Fu Huating, director of the preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, described the impact of price fluctuations on legitimate industry and commerce: "National industry and commerce are like ships sailing in the sea. When prices soar, it is like encountering stormy waves, and small ships are in danger of being overturned by the waves at any time!"
    But for speculative merchants, stable prices are tantamount to a head-on blow. This is first reflected in the private silver and money industry speculators. Several banks and money shops, such as Beijing's Dazhong Bank and Junxing and Money Shop, have already gone bankrupt. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, many private banks and money shops had always been combined with hoarding and speculation due to inflation and soaring prices, with usury and speculation in gold and silver as their main businesses. After liberation, prices also fluctuated three times last year, giving these speculators an opportunity to exploit. Today, these speculators have suffered the failure they deserve. In the future, private banks and money shops can only have a future if they change their business methods, change their service targets, that is, truly serve the industrial and commercial production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Just as Mr. Fu Huating said: Many people in the industrial and commercial circles have only learned how to operate when prices fluctuate from the beginning; suddenly encountering stable prices, they are somewhat "confused." But some people have seen the bright future under this great change and have already taken action. Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store is optimistic that after prices are stable, they can replenish the goods they sell at any time, and has begun to sell more at low profits. Now the daily turnover has increased more than ten times than before.

### 北京各界人民欢呼物价稳定  投机商人受当头棒喝

　　北京各界人民欢呼物价稳定
    投机商人受当头棒喝
    【本报讯】北京各界人民，欣喜物价稳落，纷纷发表意见，拥护人民政府的稳定物价政策。
    工人
    在反动的国民党统治时期，遭受物价波动痛苦最深的首先要算工人。例如北京被服厂的工人康仲太，在国民党反动派第一次实行“币制改革”之初，他每月挣得的工资可以买四袋面粉，但一个月以后，却连一袋面粉也买不到。北京解放后，虽然物价也有几次波动，但人民政府对工人的工资采取了实物计算的办法，保证了工人每月按物价指数领到工资；同时由于各厂有合作社的组织，在三天之内，可以买到所需要的粮食等日用品，而不受物价上涨的影响。从物价波动这一问题来看，由于两种社会制度的不同，工人得到的待遇也就不一样。今天全国的物价稳定下来了，工人们回想着过去国民党时期的痛苦，他们的喜悦无疑的更增加了。因为解放后，工人的生活虽已得到保障，但由于领到工资后，必需急着到合作社买粮食，备受拥挤之苦；且往往耽误生产时间。而油盐等物品在市场购买，仍然要受到物价上涨的影响。今天却不同了，工人领到工资，不怕物价波动，可以从容购买货物。正如工人康仲太所说：我们工人虽然领的是实物工资，但我们对于这次物价的稳定，是十二分欢迎的；我们也能更安心地生产了。琉璃厂大众电料行按装工人冀文学说：“物价稳定，我们的生意就好做啦！以前物价涨得厉害，就没法定活，说好的价钱等拿到钱时，就又不值钱了。现在定活可不那么心跳了。”
    在日寇侵陷北京时，三轮车工人家无隔宿之粮，白天拉车，黑夜排队去挤“混合面”。国民党反动派统治时期，物价更是一日数涨。他们以终日劳动所得，到晚间去买粮食时，粮店都“扣箥箩”了；第二天，“隔夜存款”就大大地打了折扣。现在物价稳定了，三轮车工人的生活也和其他劳动人民一样，随之安定下来。一个三轮车工人一天收入平均七、八千元，养活三、四口人没问题。三轮车洋车工会的李敬祥说：“物价涨的时候，拉三轮要的价永远赶不上粮价涨得快；要价大了，人家不坐，只好减价拉。物价一涨，我们卖苦力气的就倒了霉。现在物价稳定了，一天拉的钱，准能买到应得的粮食，就不必整天着急了。”
    教员学生
    对于物价的日趋稳定，京市广大教育工作者和学生们一致认为这是在过去多年来不曾有过和不可能有的，也是只有在人民政府的正确的财经政策下才能实现的事情。这个变化已直接在他们的生活间引起了反响：过去，教职员们领到薪金就抢着去买东西，怕买的晚了吃亏。“现在，谁也不用操那份心！票子放在口袋里不必考虑吃亏与否的问题。”这是市立二中教员刘福洲和汇文中学的教员杨建章、陈介白等从切身的生活中体验到的结论。在同学们的伙食团里，过去每当收到一批伙食费，就赶快去买面、向油盐店定下大批货物，就是这样，伙食委员们还每天担心着到月底开不出饭来。现在伙食委员们再没有这个顾虑了。由于物价的稳落，这次二中膳团在结伙时每个人都吃到了五、六个鸡蛋，吃到了炸豆腐、肉和两顿馒头。这在二中是没有过的事情。汇文中学的工友许九如，过去吃饭只吃咸菜，现在也能吃些别的菜了。当副教导主任陶棨问到他的时候，他笑着说：“虽然我们的薪金没增加，但是毛主席的政策让我改善了生活！”
    住在大安南宫十三号的市民赵宪周说：“今天人民政府可把奸商们给治住了。奸商们从来都是赚小钱不解渴，常常兴风作浪哄抬物价。可是今天我们也能挺起腰板来过两天好日子了！”一位现在从事织袜副业的家庭妇女张梅青说：“物价落了，我打心里头高兴了，小菜每顿也可多吃点。咱们人民政府实在有办法！”
    工商界
    物价稳定，增加了正当工商业恢复与发展的良好条件。北京工商界刘一峰说：“物价不波动，正当工商业就保证有一定利润，可以稳步地发展了”。自抗日战争以来，物价直线上升，一般工商业若以货币数字计算盈亏，都获得不知若干万倍的利润；但实际卖了货就补不进来，仓库存货一天天减少。北京最大的一家绸布庄瑞蚨祥在一九三七年以前，库存经常保持一万多匹布，现在则只剩了两千多匹。该号经理焦寰五说：存货一年年减少，就是因为卖了钱以后，受物价暴涨的影响，买不进同等数量的货。现在物价稳定了，情况就不同了。北京工商联合会筹备委员会主任委员傅华亭形容物价波动对正当工商业影响说：“民族工商业好像大海里航行的船，在物价飞涨时，就等于遇到惊涛骇浪，小船随时有被波浪打翻的危险！”
    但对投机商人来说，物价平稳无异是当头棒喝。首先表现在私营银钱业投机者身上。在北京已经有大中银行、峻兴和钱庄等几家倒闭。不少的私营银行钱庄在国民党反动政府统治时期，由于通货膨胀，物价飞腾，一直是与囤积倒把结合着，以高利贷和倒卖金银为主要业务。解放以后，去年一年物价也曾波动三次，又给予这些投机者以钻隙机会。今天，这些投机者们已遭到应得的失败。今后，私营银行钱庄只有改变经营方法，改变服务对象，也就是真正地为有利国计民生的工商业生产服务，才有前途。正像傅华亭先生说的：工商界许多人，由开始就只学会了在物价波动时如何经营；骤然遇到物价平稳，一时就有些“摸不着头脑”。但已有人在这大转变下看到了光明的远景，并且已经行动起来。瑞蚨祥绸布庄看准了物价平稳后，卖出货就可随时补进，已开始薄利多销，现在每天流水数字比以前增加多了十倍。
