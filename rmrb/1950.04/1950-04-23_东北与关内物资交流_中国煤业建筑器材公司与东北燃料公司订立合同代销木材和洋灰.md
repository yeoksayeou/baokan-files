The contract stipulates that 150,000 cubic meters of timber from Northeast China (equivalent to 7,000 train cars) will be transported to the rest of China starting from April. The timber will be allocated to Tianjin, Beijing, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan based on the construction needs of various places in the rest of China for use as mine pit props and urban housing construction, etc. The contract also stipulates that the Northeast Fuel Company is responsible for all transportation costs of timber entering customs from the point of departure to Shanhaiguan, but the transportation costs from Shanhaiguan to the receiving point will be temporarily advanced by the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, and settlement procedures will be carried out at the end of the month with receipts. All proceeds from the sale of timber, after deducting a 2% agency fee for the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, will be transferred to the local bank for appropriation. The deadline for selling all timber on consignment is the end of December. In addition, in order to support the production of the private Qixin Cement Company and also to meet the needs of industrial and mining construction in Northeast China, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has signed a contract with the Northeast Fuel Company to sell 60,000 tons of cement on consignment (accounting for approximately 80% of the company's monthly production).
