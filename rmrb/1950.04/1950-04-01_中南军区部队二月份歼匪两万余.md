　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th. The troops of the Central South Military Region of the People's Liberation Army actively carried out the work of suppressing the remaining bandits. In February, they wiped out a total of 22,445 bandits and special forces, bringing the total number of bandits eliminated to 62,589, including January’s total. Of the 23,000 bandits wiped out in February, 2,559 bandit officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, 15,047 bandits were captured, including Liu Jiashu, commander of the 17th Bandit Army, Mo Shujie, commander of the Guixi Military and Political Region, and others. A total of 4,839 bandits surrendered and accepted reorganization. The captured items included 97 various cannons, 39 grenade launchers, 73 rifle grenades, 634 light and heavy machine guns, 7 anti-aircraft machine guns, 305 submachine guns, 163 carbines, 20,697 rifles of various types, 890 various shells, 476,081 various bullets, 5,826 hand grenades, 25 radio stations, 170 telephone switchboards and single units, 309 mules and horses, and many other military supplies.
    Due to the different times of liberation in various provinces of the Central South region, the progress of bandit suppression work is also inconsistent. Among them, the bandits in Henan Province have been completely wiped out; after three phases of bandit suppression military operations in Jiangxi Province, the bandit gangs have also been basically eliminated; after the bandit gangs entrenched in Baokang area in Hubei Province were annihilated by us, only some remnant bandits in the southwestern Hubei-Sichuan-Hunan border area remain to be eliminated. Except for western Hunan, which was liberated later, there are no bandit activities in most areas of Hunan. Based on the above situation, in the future, in addition to western Hunan, which was liberated later, and some mountainous and coastal areas of Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, which still need to concentrate their efforts to combat large and small bandit gangs, the bandit suppression work in the vast areas of Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces mainly lies in combining the rural anti-local tyrant and rent reduction movements to clear out scattered bandits. To this end, the Central South Military and Political Committee specifically proposed in the resolution on the tasks for 1950 that it will strive to completely eliminate the remaining bandits in the provinces of the Central South region within three months to half a year, and called on the people of the entire region to actively assist the troops in completing this bandit suppression task, establish a revolutionary political power of the people's democratic dictatorship in the vast rural areas, and ensure the rapid recovery and development of the region's production and construction undertakings.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 29th. In the battles to encircle and annihilate the remnants of the 17th Army of the Kuomintang bandit gang who had fled back into the country and to suppress the bandit gangs scattered in various places in February, the various units under the Guangxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army eliminated a total of 11,724 enemy soldiers. Among them, 8,467 bandits were captured, including Liu Jiashu, the lieutenant general commander of the 17th Bandit Army, Liu Renbo, the major general deputy chief of staff, Zeng Tiaobin, the major general commander of the 197th Division, and Cai Ya'e, the colonel deputy commander of the division; 1,125 bandits were killed or wounded; 977 bandits surrendered, including the bandit leader Tao Yanjiang; 1,175 bandits accepted reorganization, including the bandit leader Zhou Shilin. The captured items included 43 various cannons, 296 light and heavy machine guns, 6,395 various guns, 695 various shells, 145,995 bullets, and a portion of other military supplies.

　　中南军区部队二月份歼匪两万余
    【新华社汉口三十日电】人民解放军中南军区部队积极进行清剿残匪工作，二月份中歼灭土匪及特务武装共二万二千四百四十五名，连同一月份歼匪人数共达六万二千五百八十九名。二月份歼匪二万三千余名中，计毙伤匪官兵二千五百五十九名，俘匪十七兵团司令刘嘉树、桂西军政区司令莫树杰等以下一万五千零四十七名，投降和接受改编之匪共四千八百三十九名。缴获各种炮九十七门，掷弹筒三十九个，枪榴筒七十三个，轻重机枪六百三十四挺，高射机枪七挺，冲锋枪三百零五支，卡宾枪一百六十三支，长短枪二万零六百九十七支，各种炮弹八百九十发，各种子弹四十七万六千零八十一发，手榴弹五千八百二十六枚，电台二十五部，电话总机、单机共一百七十部，骡马三百零九匹及其他军用物资甚多。
    中南地区各省由于解放时间先后不同，剿匪工作进展也不一致，其中河南全省土匪已被彻底歼灭；江西省在经过三期剿匪军事行动后，股匪亦已基本肃清；湖北地区自盘踞保康一带股匪被我歼灭后，目前只剩下鄂西南川湘交界处之部分残匪前待肃清；湖南除解放较迟之湘西外，大部地区已无股匪活动。根据以上情况，中南地区今后除解放较迟之湘西及桂、粤两省部分山地和沿海地区仍需集中力量打击大小股匪外，其余豫、赣、鄂、湘各省广大地区的剿匪工作主要在于结合农村反恶霸、减租等运动进行清剿散匪。为此，中南军政委员会特于一九五○年工作任务的决议中，首先提出争取在三个月到半年的时间内彻底消灭中南地区各省残余土匪，并号召全区人民积极协助部队完成此一剿匪任务，建立广大农村的人民民主专政的革命政权，保障全区的生产建设事业得以迅速恢复和发展。
    【新华社南宁二十九日电】人民解放军广西军区所属各部，二月份在围歼回窜国境的国民党匪帮十七兵团残部及清剿各地股匪散匪的战斗中，共计消灭匪军一万一千七百二十四名。其中俘匪十七兵团中将司令刘嘉树、少将副参谋长刘忍波、一九七师少将师长曾祧斌、上校副师长蔡亚锷以下八千四百六十七名；毙伤匪一千一百二十五名；匪军投降者计匪首陶衍江等以下九百七十七名；接受改编者计匪首周世林等以下一千一百七十五名。缴获各种炮四十三门，轻重机枪二百九十六挺，各种枪六千三百九十五枝，各种炮弹六百九十五发，子弹十四万五千九百九十五发，及其他军用物资一部。
