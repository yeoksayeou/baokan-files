　　We agree with and accept the basic spirit of the criticism leveled against us in the "Party Life" column on March 20th. With the help of the Industry Branch of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, we have conducted a self-criticism and have further recognized the root causes of our mistakes.

　　The most significant shortcoming of the General Branch Committee is its failure to guarantee and supervise production effectively. Firstly, our ideological understanding was not clear enough. Therefore, the General Branch rarely studied how to guarantee and supervise production, and even less formulated plans and steps to guarantee and supervise production based on the specific conditions of our factory. We remained at the level of general appeals without making specific arrangements. Some urgent problems in production that needed to be resolved, such as the work system, production allocation, and wages, were not formally discussed at the General Branch meeting. We simply raised the problems without proposing active solutions. Although ordinary party members generally played a certain role in production, the General Branch failed to further study and guide them based on the situation below, so that each party member could not only work hard in production themselves, but also unite all employees to complete the production tasks.

　　The General Branch Committee should become the political and ideological leading core of the entire factory. Because the General Branch had not specifically studied the relationship between the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League departments and how to cooperate with each other, some relatively significant issues in administration were not brought to the General Branch Committee for discussion but were handled independently. The General Branch also rarely studied the work of the labor union and the Youth League, providing them with directions and guidelines. This resulted in each department acting on its own, unable to cooperate with each other. Furthermore, because each member of the General Branch lacked detailed and thorough investigation and research on the various situations within the factory, they could not persuade each other at the meetings, leading to stubborn insistence on their own opinions. This disagreement gradually led to uncoordinated relationships between cadres, which further affected the improvement of work, causing the Party to lose its core role in all work.

　　The shortcomings of the General Branch had existed for a long time, and not every comrade was unaware of them. However, they allowed the shortcomings to continue and develop for a long time, which deepened their severity. The main reason for this was that each comrade adopted a serious attitude of liberalism towards the shortcomings in the work and lacked a serious sense of responsibility. Criticism and self-criticism were not carried out within the Party, and a conciliatory attitude was adopted towards shortcomings. The General Branch also committed serious bureaucratism, only focusing its work on solving specific problems and daily trivial matters, with little research on work policies and leadership methods. In work, it showed a lack of planning, steps, and inspection, which made the leadership of the General Branch weak and powerless.

　　Finally, we believe that in order to completely transform the leadership of the General Branch, we must first establish a strong leadership core, so that all work revolves around production. Although we have conducted a self-criticism, it is still not deep enough. In order to improve the Party's work, we must continue to carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, and truly realize the Party's role in guaranteeing and supervising production. Secondly, in the criticism in the "Party Life" column, it was mentioned that after the implementation of the bonus system for exceeding quotas, the actual pressure of some water pumps with a specified pressure of 120 pounds was reduced to 80 pounds. The situation is as follows: The standard specification for water pumps is 120 pounds of pressure, but the factory's boiler for testing water pumps could only generate steam up to 80 pounds. After switching to cold pump testing, the test results generally met the standard specification of 120 pounds of pressure. Other individual specific issues and factual discrepancies do not need to be stated here.

### 七十兵工厂总支委员会的检讨

　　七十兵工厂总支委员会的检讨
    我们同意并接受三月二十日《党的生活》栏对我们批评的基本精神。我们在北京市委组织部工支科的帮助下进行了检讨，更进一步地认识了产生错误的根源。
    总支委员会最主要的缺点是在生产上未能起到保证与监督作用。首先，在思想上认识不够明确，因此，总支很少研究如何保证与监督生产，更未根据本厂的具体情况制出保证与监督生产的计划与步骤，只是停留在一般的号召，而未做过具体布置。生产上存在的迫切需要解决的一些问题，如工务制度、生产调配、工资等问题，没有正式在总支会上研究过，只是简单地提出问题，而未提出解决问题的积极办法。虽然一般党员在生产上均能起一定作用，但总支未能根据下面情况，进一步加以研究和指导，使每个党员不只自己积极努力生产，而且更能团结全体职工去完成生产任务。
    总支委员会应成为全厂在政治上，思想上的领导核心。由于总支未专门研究过党、政、工、团各部门的关系及如何相互配合，因此，行政上遇有一些较重大的问题时，也有未拿到总支委员会上来讨论，而自行处理了。工会和团的工作，总支也很少加以研究，给以方针和方向的指示。形成了各自为政，不能互相配合。更由于每个总支委员对厂内各种情况缺少详细地、周密地调查研究，因此，在会上也就互相不能说服，形成了固执的坚持己见。由于意见的不一致，逐渐造成干部关系的不协调，这样，就更影响了工作的改进。使党在一切工作上失去了核心作用。
    总支的缺点是早就存在着的，每个同志并不是没有察觉，而是长期地放任缺点的继续存在与发展，以致加深缺点的严重性。其主要原因，则是每个同志对工作中的缺点采取了严重的自由主义态度，缺乏严肃的负责精神。党内未能开展批评与自我批评，对缺点采取了调和的态度。总支也犯了严重的事务主义，只将自己的工作停留在解决具体问题与日常琐事上，对工作方针与领导方法则很少研究，在工作上表现了无计划无步骤无检查，以致使总支的领导陷于软弱无力。
    最后，我们认为，为了彻底转变总支的领导，首先必须建立坚强的领导核心，使一切工作围绕着生产而进行。虽然，我们经过了检讨，但还很不深刻。为了使党的工作能提高一步，必须继续开展批评与自我批评，加强团结，真正的实现党在生产上的保证与监督作用。其次，《党的生活》栏在批评中提到实行超额给奖制后，规格为一百二十磅压力的水泵，有的竟降低至八十磅的实际情况是这样的：水泵标准规格为一百二十磅压力，但厂内试验水泵的锅炉的蒸气只能烧到八十磅。改用冷泵抽试后，试验结果一般均合乎一百二十磅压力的标准规格。其他个别具体问题与事实稍有出入者，不必在此申述了。
