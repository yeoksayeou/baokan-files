Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 27th: According to a report from Electra, the World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a May Day manifesto, calling on workers to "turn May Day 1950 into a global festival where the working people of all countries actively express their desire to establish a solid and lasting peace throughout the world." On this day, "working men and women around the world will enthusiastically sign the solemn appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress."

The World Federation of Trade Unions, after pointing out that wars are already raging in several colonial countries, declared: "The working class, with firm determination, must stop the imperialist war preparations and stand at the forefront of this struggle. In many capitalist countries, the working class opposes the production and transportation of weapons, and they will intensify their efforts."

The manifesto pointed out: "Since last May Day, the number of martyrs of the working class has increased, which is a sign of the increasingly fierce struggle between workers and their exploiters." The World Federation of Trade Unions mourns all the martyrs of the working class and pays tribute to the workers who are still imprisoned in prisons today.

In its manifesto, the World Federation of Trade Unions condemned the international union-busters led by Carey (US) and Deakin (UK), and called on the workers in capitalist countries to unite, help each other, promote the solidarity of the working class, and strengthen ties with their worker brothers and sisters in several countries who have already taken their destiny into their own hands.

The manifesto pointed out that the reactionaries' attempt to isolate the World Federation of Trade Unions has been thwarted. Many new unions have joined the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and twelve Trade Union Internationals (industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions) have been proclaimed.

The manifesto concluded by calling out: "Working men and women, unite under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, regardless of political and religious beliefs! Fight for peace, democracy, the brotherhood of all nations, and freedom, fight for higher living standards, economic and social progress, fight against unemployment, demand a perfect social insurance system, and the realization of the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'!"

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 27th: TASS reports that the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has issued an appeal to the youth of the world and democratic youth for May Day - the International Day of Solidarity of Working People, calling on them to celebrate May Day this year with a burning struggle to defend peace, participate in May Day demonstrations, and resolutely support the plans and activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions - the only international trade union organization that truly defends the interests of youth and all working people.

The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth urges all democratic youth to sign the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, and to organize demonstrations everywhere to support their own demands: to strive for food and clothing and oppose poverty; to strive for employment and oppose unemployment; to strive for their political and trade union rights and oppose any act that infringes on democratic freedoms.

　　世界工联发表五一节宣言
    号召全世界劳动者起来争取和平
    世界青联发表五一节告世界青年书
    【新华社二十七日讯】据电通社巴黎讯：世界工会联合会顷发表五一节宣言，号召工人们：“把一九五○年的五一节，变成各国劳动人民积极表示要在全世界建立巩固而持久的和平的世界性节日”。在这一天，“全世界的劳动男女，将在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的庄严的呼吁书上踊跃签名”。
    世界工联在指出战争已在若干殖民地国家中激烈进行之后宣称：“工人阶级怀着坚定的心情，一定要制止帝国主义的战争准备，并且站在这个斗争的前列。在许多资本主义国家中，工人阶级反对生产和运输武器，而且他们将加紧他们的努力。”
    宣言指出：“自去年五一节以来，工人阶级殉难者的人数已经增加了，这是工人与他们剥削者之间的斗争愈益激烈的标志。”世界工联谨悼念工人阶级的一切殉难者，并向今日还被囚禁于监狱中的工人们致敬。
    世界工联在宣言中斥责以加莱（美）与狄金（英）等为首的工贼国际，并号召资本主义国家的工人，必须团结起来，互相帮助，发扬工人阶级的精诚团结，加强与若干国家内业已掌握自己命运的工人弟兄们的联系。
    宣言指出：反动派旨在孤立世界工联的企图已遭到挫败。有许多新的工会已参加到世界工联的阵营，而且有十二个工会国际（世界工联各产业部）已经宣告成立。
    宣言在结尾时号召：“男女劳动者们，不分政治与宗教信仰在世界工联领导之下团结起来！为和平、民主、各民族兄弟之谊与自由而斗争，为着更高的生活水准、经济与社会的进步而斗争，为反对失业、要求完善的社会保险制度和“同工同酬”原则的实现而斗争！”
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：世界民主青联书记处顷为五一节——全世界劳动人民国际团结日，发表告全世界劳动青年与民主青年书，号召他们在今年以如火如荼的保卫和平的斗争来庆祝五一节，参加五一节的示威游行，并且坚决支持世界工联——真正保卫青年与所有劳动人民利益的唯一的国际工会组织——的计划与活动。
    世界民主青联书记处力促所有民主青年在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书上签名，并在各处布置示威游行，以支持他们自己的要求：争取温饱，反对贫穷；争取就业，反对失业；争取他们的政治与工会权利，反对侵害民主自由的任何行为。
