Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 2nd: The disaster situation in Shuyang County, a severely hit area in northern Jiangsu, has eased following efforts in sideline production, social mutual assistance, and the distribution of relief grain. Disaster victims throughout the county have begun spring plowing. Shuyang County, traversed by the Shu River and Yi River and with many marshlands, is one of the counties most severely affected by the disaster in the Huaiyin Special District of northern Jiangsu. After more than a decade of exploitation and plunder by the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the people of the county were already impoverished. This, coupled with five consecutive years of flooding, has made life even more difficult. The county experienced a general crop failure last summer and autumn, leading to a severe famine. By late November of last year, over 21,000 households in the county had run out of food. At that time, the Yi River diversion project was underway. The county's leading organs proposed the slogan "Dredge the river while providing disaster relief," implementing work-for-relief programs combined with disaster relief. At the same time, they launched social mutual aid and a "bowl of grain" campaign to assist households without food. They also mobilized and organized disaster victims to engage in sideline production such as grinding flour, pressing oil, fishing, and weaving mats. After more than twenty days of effort, these sideline productions alone earned more than 324,000 jin of grain, enabling disaster victims to initially overcome the famine.

In late December, continuous rainfall forced the cessation of many sideline productions, and some leading cadres focused solely on dredging the river while neglecting the leadership of disaster relief, causing the disaster situation to expand again. Under these circumstances, some cadres developed negative and pessimistic sentiments and waited for relief. The Shuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately held various meetings, both inside and outside the Party, to propose a disaster relief plan and conduct education on production-based disaster relief, overcoming the pessimistic sentiments of individual cadres. By January, disaster victims in the county had earned another 321,000 jin of grain through sideline production, effectively curbing the development of the disaster.

Leading Cadres Brave Snow to Investigate the Disaster, Helping Disaster Victims Overcome Difficulties

However, in February, continuous rain and snow caused the disaster situation to expand once again. The county and district people's governments immediately took emergency measures, first allocating 680,000 jin of emergency relief grain, 2,024,400 jin of grain for river dredging wages, and 145,000 jin of grain to support the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, to rescue disaster victims without food and support disaster relief production. Local leading cadres braved the snow to investigate the disaster and used various forms of in-depth publicity to inspire social sympathy and launch social mutual assistance. For example, wealthy households in Shuangyao Township, Wuji District, lent and donated more than 10,000 jin of grain to help local disaster victims overcome the difficulties caused by the rain and snow. After the Spring Festival, the weather warmed up, and sideline production gradually resumed in various places. The government also distributed a large amount of relief grain, thus stopping the development of the disaster situation, and the disaster situation gradually diminished in some areas. Currently, in addition to continuing to carry out production-based disaster relief, disaster victims in the county are actively engaged in spring plowing.

Some experience has been gained in the county's work of carrying out sideline production and distributing relief grain. This experience is that, first, it is necessary to formulate an overall plan based on the overall disaster situation and production situation. The plan should determine which types of sideline production the government should support, how funds should be allocated, and which types of sideline production the masses themselves can organize. Then, each district and township should mobilize and organize separately based on specific circumstances. Second, it is necessary to make good use of economic institutions such as supply and marketing cooperatives and trade companies to enable them to resolve the raw material and sales problems of sideline production in a more planned manner. Finally, when mobilizing and organizing sideline production, it is necessary to emphasize universality and mass participation. In addition to absorbing disaster victims who are the most severely affected by the disaster as much as possible in the sideline production supported by the government, it is also necessary to mobilize mutual assistance between disaster victims and non-disaster victims to solve the difficulties of lack of funds, labor, and tools. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to organizing disaster victims to carry out a variety of sideline productions in accordance with local conditions. When distributing relief grain, it is necessary to focus on distribution and closely integrate it with production in order to achieve good results. For example, Xifang Village, Dingzhuang Township, took long-term, regular, temporary allocation and supplementary methods for distribution based on the disaster victims' labor, capital, and number of relatives and friends. Shuangyao Township concentrated relief grain into sideline production, turning it into production funds. Both of these methods achieved great results because they focused on distribution and closely integrated it with production.

### 苏北重灾区灾情趋缓和  沭阳灾民春耕  组织生产发动社会互助收大效

　　苏北重灾区灾情趋缓和
    沭阳灾民春耕
    组织生产发动社会互助收大效
    【新华社上海二日电】苏北重灾区的沭阳县，经过副业生产、社会互济、发放救济粮等工作后，目前灾情已趋缓和，全县灾民并已进入春耕。沭阳县内有沭河、沂河，荡地很多，是苏北淮阴专区灾情最重的一个县。该县人民在遭受日伪蒋匪十余年来的搜括抢劫后，家底本来已空，又加连续五年的水灾，生活更形困苦。去年夏、秋，该县普遍歉收，因而发生严重的灾荒。去年十一月下旬全县断炊者即达二万一千余户。这时，导沂工程正在紧张进行，该县领导机关即提出“一面扒河，一面救灾”的口号，实行以工代赈结合救灾，一面又展开社会互助互济，发动“一碗粮”运动，援救断炊户，同时又动员与组织灾民开展拐粉、打油、捕鱼、织席等副业生产，经过二十余天的努力，单单以上的几项副业生产就赚得了三十二万四千余斤粮食，使灾民初步地渡过灾荒。
    十二月下旬，阴雨连绵，很多副业生产被迫停顿，部分领导干部又只偏重于扒河而放松了救灾的领导，致使灾情又形扩大。在这种情形下，个别干部就产生了消极悲观的情绪和等待救济的思想。中共沭阳县委员会就在这时立即通过党内党外的各种会议，提出了救灾计划，并进行贯彻生产救灾的教育，克服个别干部的悲观情绪。至一月份，该县灾民在开展副业生产中又赚得了三十二万一千余斤粮食，有效地制止了灾情的发展。
    领导干部冒雪查灾  帮助灾民渡过难关
    但到二月间，又逢连续雨雪，灾情因此又再度扩大，该县县、区人民政府当又立即采取紧急措施，首先拨发急救粮六十八万斤，扒河工资粮二百零二万四千余斤，优待烈属、军属粮十四万五千斤，抢救断炊灾民和扶助灾民生产。当地领导干部又冒雪查灾，并运用多种形式，深入宣传，启发社会同情，发动社会互济。如吴集区双窑乡有积蓄户即共借出和献出粮食一万余斤，帮助当地灾民渡过了雨雪难关。春节以后，天气暖和，各地副业生产都先后恢复，政府又发下大批救济粮食，因而使灾情停止发展，部分地区灾情且日渐缩小。现该县灾民除继续开展生产救灾外，并正积极进行春耕。
    在该县开展副业生产和发放救济粮的工作中，已获得了一些经验。这些经验就是：开展副业生产首先要根据全面灾情和生产情况，作出通盘计划，在计划中确定政府应支持的副业生产是那几种，基金如何分配，群众本身能组织那几种副业，然后，各区、乡再根据具体情况去分别动员和组织。其次，要很好地运用供销合作社、贸易公司等经济机关，使它们更有计划地解决副业生产的原料和销路问题。最后，在发动和组织副业生产时，必须强调普遍性和群众性，除政府扶持的副业生产应尽量吸收受灾最重的灾民参加外，同时还应发动灾民与非灾民的互助互济，以解决资金、劳力、工具缺乏等困难，此外并须注意组织灾民因地制宜地展开多种多样的副业生产。在发放救济粮时，必须有重点地发放和密切结合生产，这样才能收到好的效果。如该县丁庄乡西坊村根据灾民的劳力、资本、亲友多寡等情况，分别采取长期、定期、临时配给和补给等方法进行发放。双窑乡将救济粮集中投入副业生产，使它变为生产资金。这两种方法都因有重点地发放和密切结合生产而收到很大的效果。
