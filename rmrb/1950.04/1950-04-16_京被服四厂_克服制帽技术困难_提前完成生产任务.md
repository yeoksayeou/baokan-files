　　Beijing Garment Factory No. 4
    Overcomes Technical Difficulties in Hat Making, Completes Production Task Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Dispatch] Workers at Beijing Garment Factory No. 4 overcame various difficulties and completed their production tasks on schedule. The factory's total task was to produce 34,5650 military caps. The original plan was to start work on December 26th of last year and complete it by April 1st. However, due to insufficient accessories (steel strips not arriving), the official start was delayed until January 20th. This year's work differed from previous years, and most workers had never done it before. To meet the required standards, the workers organized a technical research group, with experienced masters teaching apprentices, and guarantees were established. The specific work steps were: January was mainly for learning techniques, focusing on quality; February was for emphasizing both quality and quantity; and March was for a concentrated push. In the first week, the output of each sewing machine was only 12.34 caps, with the highest individual output being 20.82 caps and the lowest being 10.25 caps. Moreover, the products did not meet the standards. In February, the average output increased to 27.36 caps, with individual highs reaching 31.6 to 39.5 caps. The main problems during this period were strip misalignment, caps being slightly different in size at the front and back, uneven cotton filling, and stitch counts not meeting the requirements. These issues were promptly corrected after inspection. The hemming and sewing workers also initially had low output due to lack of skill, but gradually became proficient after half a month, with most reaching the standard of 48 caps. The highest output reached 55 caps. Starting on February 28th, the workers launched a competition based on individual and group plans, and finally successfully completed all tasks on March 30th.

　　京被服四厂
    克服制帽技术困难  提前完成生产任务
    【本报讯】京被服四厂工友克服种种困难，按期完成生产任务。该厂的总任务是三四五、六五○顶军帽。原计划于去年十二月二十六日开工至四月一日完成，后因附料不足（钢条未到）延至一月二十日正式开工。今年的工作与往年不同，一般的工人都没作过，为了达到这一标准，工人们组织了技术研究小组，会做的师傅教徒弟，并立了保证书。具体工作步骤是：一月份主要学习技术，注重质量；二月份是质量数量并重，三月份突击。开始的一星期内，每台低车产量仅一二·三四顶，个人最高者二○·八二顶，最低者一○·二五顶。产品且不够标准。二月份平均可出二七·三六顶强，个人最高可达到三一·六顶至三九·五顶。这一时期的主要毛病是扣条跑条，帽前后互有小者，棉花不均，针码不合规定。经过检查已及时纠正。锁缀工最初也由于技术不熟练、成绩微小，半月后逐渐熟练，一般均可达到四八顶的标准。最高者可达五五顶。二月二十八日开始，工友们都根据个人与组内所订的计划发起了竞赛，终于在三月三十日胜利完成全部任务。
