Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. Shanghai has suffered from imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary blockades and bandit aircraft bombing of electricity, the rural purchasing power is affected by famine and seasonal restrictions, and economic changes caused by price stability have led to the closure of some industrial and commercial enterprises, causing some workers to become unemployed. In addition to the necessary responsibility of the capitalists and the possible efforts of the People's Government, the employed workers nationwide should also provide comrades with assistance in relieving unemployment. To this end, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has decided to launch a movement to relieve unemployed workers, calling on all employed workers in the city to donate one day's wages as a relief fund, and also sent a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, requesting it to call on workers across the country to provide necessary and possible mutual assistance and relief based on class sympathy. The full text of the letter is as follows: All-China Federation of Trade Unions:

Since the bandit aircraft indiscriminately bombed Shanghai on February 6th, destroying electricity, the unemployment situation in Shanghai has become even more serious. Up to now, according to preliminary statistics, the number of unemployed workers has exceeded 150,000, including their families, no less than 500,000. The lives of unemployed workers are already very difficult. Living on porridge soup is already a very common phenomenon, and the number of people using bean dregs, bean cakes, chaff, and wild vegetables to fill their stomachs is increasing daily. Cases of being evicted by landlords for being unable to afford rent are heard everywhere. Despite this, unemployed workers deeply appreciate the current difficulties of the country and the reasons for them, and know that the severity of the unemployment situation is mainly due to the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by the US imperialists and the Chiang bandits. As long as the Chiang bandits are completely annihilated and Taiwan is recovered, Shanghai's economy will begin to improve. After the implementation of land reform to increase farmers' purchasing power, the national industrial and commercial situation will fundamentally improve, the unemployment problem can be gradually solved, and workers' lives will gradually improve. Therefore, they are not pessimistic, nor do they complain, but under the leadership of trade union organizations, they use every means to fight against difficulties to overcome this year—the last year of serious difficulties.

Since liberation, the Shanghai working class has made unremitting struggles against the enemy's blockade and bombing, and has achieved some results, especially in overcoming difficulties and maintaining production. Under the correct guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and under the direct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai working class has full confidence and hope in completing this task.

However, the problem facing the Shanghai working class is that so many unemployed brothers are displaced and suffering in their lives, and emergency relief must be provided. In view of this, the Federation, based on the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the working class and promoting class love, unanimously passed the "Decision of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions to Call on All Employed Workers in the City to Donate One Day's Wages to Relieve Unemployed Workers in Shanghai" at the Eighth Expanded Standing Committee Meeting on April 12. All trade unions have expressed their support and endorsement of this call and are urgently mobilizing and responding. Based on the power of the Shanghai working class, which is now basically fully organized, and the performance of various tasks since liberation, it is certain that they can show full concern and care for their class brothers. Therefore, it is expected that this movement will achieve certain results. However, the strength of the workers in Shanghai is still limited, and at present, various industries in Shanghai are struggling to maintain their positions, and many workers are in a state of semi-unemployment. Therefore, in addition to appealing to people from all walks of life through the worker representatives in the upcoming Third Shanghai Municipal People's Congress to launch a social relief movement, the Federation hereby reports to you, please consider appealing to the working class across the country to provide necessary and possible mutual assistance and relief, and please give active assistance to all fraternal trade unions across the country based on class sympathy. Whether it is appropriate or not, please give instructions.

With respect,
Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions

### 上海总工会致函全总  向全国工人弟兄呼吁  互助救济沪失业工人

　　上海总工会致函全总
    向全国工人弟兄呼吁  互助救济沪失业工人
    【新华社上海十六日电】上海因受帝国主义和国民党反动派封锁和匪机轰炸破坏电力，农村购买力受灾荒影响和季节限制，及物价稳定所引起的经济变化，使一部分工商业歇业，一部分工人因而陷于失业。救济失业除资本家方面应负必要责任，人民政府应作可能努力外，全国在业工人亦应作同志的援助。为此上海总工会决定举行救济失业工人运动，号召全市在业工人各捐工资一天，作为救济基金，同时并致函全国总工会，请求号召全国工人本着阶级同情作必要的和可能的互助救济。该函全文如下：中华全国总工会：
    自从二月六日匪机滥炸上海破坏电力以后，上海失业情况更见严重。迄目前为止，根据初步统计，失业工人人数已逾十五万人，连其家属在内不下五十万人。失业工人的生活已是十分困苦。以喝粥汤度日者已是极普遍的现象，而以豆渣、豆饼、糠秕、野菜充饥者已日有增加。因无力负担房租而遭房东驱逐退租者到处可闻。虽然如此，失业工人对于目前国家的困难及其所以造成的原因深有体会，知道失业情况的严重性主要是由于美帝蒋匪长期封锁和不断轰炸所造成。只要彻底歼灭蒋匪，收复台湾，上海经济便将开始好转。而在实行土地改革提高农民购买力后，全国工商业情况便能根本好转，失业问题便可逐步解决，并且工人生活也就会逐渐改善起来。因此并不悲观，也不怨言，而在工会组织领导之下用尽一切办法向困难作斗争，来渡过今年——最后的严重困难的一年。
    上海工人阶级在解放以来为反对敌人封锁轰炸，曾作不折不挠的斗争，并特别在克服困难维持生产的任务上已有若干成绩。在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确方针之下，在中华全国总工会的直接领导之下，上海工人阶级对于这个任务的完成是有充分的信心和希望的。
    但是放在上海工人阶级面前的问题是目前有这样多的失业弟兄流离失所和生活痛苦，必须加以紧急救济。属会有鉴于此，本着工人阶级团结互助的精神，发扬阶级友爱，已于四月十二日第八次常委扩大会议上一致通过“上海总工会为救济上海失业工人号召全市在业工人捐助一天工资的决定”，各业工会均表示支持和拥护这一号召，已在紧急动员纷纷响应中。以上海工人阶级目前在基本上已完全组织起来的力量和解放以来的各项工作表现，自必能对于自己阶级弟兄表现充分的关怀和爱护，因此预计这一运动当能有一定的成就。惟上海一地工人力量尚属有限，且目前上海开工各业均处在勉强维持的地位，不少的工人处于半失业状态。为此属会除通过即将召开的第三届上海市各界人民代表会议中的工人代表向各界人士呼吁发动社会救济运动外，特报告你们，请考虑向全国工人阶级呼吁作必要的和可能的互助救济，并请全国各兄弟工会本着阶级的同情，予以积极的援助。是否有当，请指示。
                          此致敬礼                           
                       上海总工会
                                    一九五○年四月十四日
