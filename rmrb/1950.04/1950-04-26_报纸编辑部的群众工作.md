The Party Central Committee pays great attention to improving newspaper work and raising its political and ideological level. This stems from the great historical tasks facing our Party and our country under the current conditions.

The Soviet people are realizing the great post-war Stalin plan for the reconstruction and development of the national economy. A socialist emulation campaign is unfolding everywhere among workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. Our newspapers and periodicals—powerful weapons of socialist construction—play a vital role in organizing people's emulation and in mobilizing the masses to further strengthen the power of our great motherland.

The Party has launched extensive ideological work. Raising the political and cultural level of the people, consolidating the communist consciousness of the working masses, overcoming capitalist remnants in human consciousness, and educating in Soviet patriotism and national self-esteem are all necessities for Soviet society. Bolshevik newspapers and periodicals, as powerful ideological weapons in the hands of the Party and brilliant tools for the political education of the working masses, have a great impact on strengthening the education of the masses and promoting the consolidation and development of all ideological work of the Party organization.

At present, the Party faces enormous tasks in party organization and political-ideological work. Newspapers and periodicals are equally important in solving these tasks.

All of this requires a serious consolidation of our newspapers, an increase in their political and ideological level, and an increase in their role in the domestic political, economic, and cultural life.

The improvement of newspapers, the expansion of their themes, and the depth of their content will primarily depend on how widely the editorial department absorbs active authors to cooperate in the newspaper. Universally absorbing correspondent groups from party activists, workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals, and close contact with the masses and readers, is the key to the vitality and improvement of the quality of all our newspapers.

	I

Bolshevik newspapers, as a new type of newspaper, have as one of their most important principles the mass character of the newspaper.

Lenin and Stalin taught us that the strength of the Bolshevik Party lies in its broad and close ties with the people, in its ability to listen to the opinions of the masses and understand their needs, and in not only educating the masses but also learning from them.

Comrade Stalin instructed: "The strength of the Bolsheviks lies in maintaining contact with their mother, the masses who gave birth to, raised, and educated the Bolsheviks. When they maintain contact with their mother, with the people, they have every opportunity to become invincible." (Stalin, "On the Shortcomings of Party Work and Measures for Liquidating Trotskyite and Other Double-Dealers")

Close and constant contact with the people, the ability to talk with the masses every day and reflect their demands, is where the strength of the Bolshevik newspaper lies.

The mass character is also the fundamental and principled difference between our newspapers and the bourgeois newspapers. The mission of the bourgeois newspaper is to protect, decorate capitalism, and make it suitable for the capitalist system. The newspaper does not serve the people, but serves the exploiting classes and their interests. Lenin wrote that the bourgeois newspaper is a tool for the rich to communicate information and a tool for deceiving and fooling the working people, a tool for enslaving the people. The recent behavior of bourgeois publishing houses is best explained by Lenin's definition. Capitalist newspapers are now serving the most brazen and brutal imperialist reactionaries. Lies, slander, and flattery have become the daily routines of newspaper monopolies and the journalists who serve them.

In our country, there is true freedom of publication. The Soviet newspaper serves the great cause of the Leninist-Stalinist Party and the entire Soviet people—the cause of communism. It cultivates noble feelings of Soviet patriotism and national self-esteem among the working masses, and encourages them to fight for the further growth and prosperity of the socialist motherland. Neither position nor greed, but rather limitless loyalty to their own people, noble Bolshevik party spirit, and ideology—these are the forces that drive the Soviet journalist cadres and are the basis of their leadership.

The principle of the mass character of our newspaper includes the following basic points.

First, the Bolshevik newspaper, by its nature and political purpose, is truly a mass, people's newspaper. The newspaper is a vivid expression of Soviet socialist democracy.

Second, our newspaper is the most resilient tool for the link between the Party and the masses, and the most important means for Bolshevik leadership of the masses.

Third, the mass character of our newspaper also lies in the fact that the newspaper is built on the basis of the active participation of the broad working people in the work of the newspaper.

	II

Constant and close contact with the masses is the basis of Bolshevik leadership. All current work of the Party organization, propaganda, encouragement, and organization, is aimed at consolidating and expanding this connection. The Party directly obtains contact with the masses along different lines and with the help of various transmission belts.

In the connection between our Party and the masses, the newspaper has played and is playing a significant role. During the preparatory period of the proletarian revolution, in order to organize workers, to conduct encouragement and propaganda among the people, and to win their influence among the masses, the Bolsheviks widely used newspapers.

Comrade Stalin wrote in the editorial of the first issue of "The Struggle" in 1901: "The most important responsibility of the newspaper is to be as close as possible to the working masses, to influence them as often as possible, and to serve as their conscious and leading center." (Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 1, Page 8)

Even after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, during the period of socialist construction, the significance of the newspaper is equally great in deepening and consolidating the connection between the Party and the people. Comrade Stalin taught that the newspaper, in terms of its power, is equal to any means of mass communication, and that the newspaper establishes an invisible connection between the Party and the working class. "The newspaper—this is the most powerful weapon, with the help of which the Party, every day and every hour, speaks to the working class in its own language, the language required by the Party. There is no other tool, no other similar and flexible organ in the world that extends the spiritual connection between the Party and the class." (Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 5, Page 204)

Comrade Stalin spoke of three conditions for correct Bolshevik leadership:

First, it is necessary to find the correct solution to this or that problem, but a correct solution cannot be found without considering the experience of the masses, without unifying two experiences: the experience of the leaders and the experience of the people. The role of the newspaper is very significant in realizing this important condition for correct leadership. Our newspapers publish many articles, communications, letters from workers, collective farm members, Communist Party members, Party and economic workers, exchanging and synthesizing the practical work experience of the majority, which has great significance in our national and economic construction.

The second important condition for correct leadership is to be good at organizing the implementation of adopted resolutions. However, this is impossible without the direct help of the masses. The newspaper helps the Party propagate the ideas and significance of the resolutions to the consciousness of the broad strata of the working masses, mobilizing them to victoriously put the Party's resolutions into practice. Obviously, this does not mean that our newspapers should be filled with superior materials similar to instructions or directives. The newspaper influences the masses, educates and organizes them with its various literary genres and working methods. It should simply and clearly talk to workers, peasants, and intellectuals, explain the Party's policies to them, and raise them to complete the tasks put forward by the Party.

Finally, the third condition for correct Bolshevik leadership is the inspection of the execution of work. However, the inspection of the execution of work cannot be organized without the direct help of the masses. In this regard, in addition to other means, the Party uses the newspaper as a weapon for social supervision and for launching broad criticism and self-criticism.

The Party has established a connection with the masses on the basis of educating the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and in the highest and noblest principles of communism.

The Party relies on these methods, these spiritual connections, to realize the connection with the masses through the newspaper.

Mass character—is the foundation of all activities of the Bolshevik newspaper. Without broad and constant contact with the masses, with readers, and with Party organizations, without vital and profound knowledge, it is impossible to truly run a good newspaper. Therefore, daily active mass work is the method of running a newspaper for the Bolsheviks.

In fact, can journalistic work be imagined without constant contact with the masses and with Party organizations? Obviously, it is unimaginable. Lenin taught us that Bolshevik newspaper workers should do what political commentators often do—write modern history. Therefore, newspaper workers should write history in such a way that what they write about daily life brings due help to the direct participants in the movement; they should write history in such a way that what they write helps the direct participants in the movement consciously choose the means, skills, and methods of struggle, and reap the greatest and most consolidated results with the least amount of effort.

They can only successfully complete this task if newspaper workers have a good understanding of life and maintain close contact with the people. In order to actively help the builders of communism, it is necessary to carefully study their heroic labor, discover everything new and progressive in our lives, and promote the best technologies and methods of labor activities discovered by innovators in socialist production among workers, peasants, and intellectuals. What is required of Bolshevik journalists is a serious knowledge of life, and they should always be at the center of the events in which the Party lives and the masses of people live. Bolshevik newspaper workers, more than anyone else, must face the masses and carefully study the creative experience of the masses and the multifaceted activities of Party organizations in socialist construction.

Newspaper workers need these connections not only for their own written work, but first of all they must constantly and as much as possible absorb correspondents from workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals to cooperate with the newspaper.

Bolshevik newspapers are forever built on the basis of the broad participation of the working people themselves in newspaper work. Our Party's great founders and leaders, Lenin and Stalin, and later the first editors of Bolshevik newspapers, gave us a brilliant example of how to run a good mass political newspaper. The newspapers led by Lenin and Stalin always had as their most unique point the active absorption of newspaper correspondents from workers, Party workers, and ordinary Party members. Such newspapers included "Iskra" and "The Struggle," "Forward" and "The Proletarian," "The Proletarian Struggle" and "The Times," "The Star" and "Pravda."

At the end of the previous century, in 1899, Lenin pointed out: "...spread among our workers the best habit of writing amateur communications to socialist newspapers..." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 4, Page 271, Fourth Edition)

Later, in the book "What Is To Be Done?" Vladimir Ilyich pointed out that even among the most backward workers, a real desire to "publish" had developed—a noble desire. (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 5, Page 369, Fourth Edition)

Indeed, the number of workers participating in Bolshevik newspaper work increased year by year. The fact that in the entire second year of publication of "Pravda" (1913-1914), more than 11,000 worker communications were published in 270 newspapers, that is, an average of more than 40 communications in each newspaper, is a good illustration.

	III

After the Great October Socialist Revolution, workers, peasants, and intellectuals participated in our newspapers on an even larger scale. The worker-peasant correspondent movement unfolded in every corner of the vast Soviet country. Sending amateur communications to newspapers has become a daily habit among our people. The noble desire to publish has become even more consolidated among the working masses.

In these years, the worker-peasant correspondent movement played a huge role in the development and consolidation of the Soviet newspaper, and in the cause of socialist construction. Stalin called workers' and rural correspondents the builders of the worker-peasant newspaper. Worker correspondents and rural correspondents are active builders of socialism. In factories, workshops, and construction sites, they are the advanced of production; in rural areas, they are tireless fighters for collective farms. In letters written to newspapers, worker-peasant correspondents boldly exposed the conspiracies of class enemies and openly criticized shortcomings. The Party always listened attentively to the voices of workers' and rural correspondents, these leaders of proletarian public opinion.

Now, in the struggle to realize the further development of the national economy and the great Stalin's reconstruction program, the worker-peasant correspondent movement, as before, plays a huge role in our newspaper work and in our country's socio-political life.

Along with the growth of our domestic economy and culture, the worker-peasant correspondent movement has also grown and expanded. The current worker-peasant correspondent movement is essentially different from the worker-peasant correspondent movement in the early years of the Soviet Union. In fact, during this period, the cultural level of our people has also greatly improved. The contradiction between mental labor and manual labor is gradually disappearing. Now, in factories and enterprises, collective farms, Soviet farms, and tractor stations, there are many people who have received seven-year middle school, secondary, and higher education. The country has increased the victorious army of millions of Soviet intellectuals.

The great socialist reforms and cultural revolution that have taken place in the country have also changed the face of the activists in our newspapers. From the facts of the cultural revolution, individual comrades have drawn precisely the opposite conclusion. They almost think like this: because of the growth of the cultural level of the Soviet people, the readers' demands on the newspaper are also higher, so first of all, we must clearly move towards literary artists and professional journalists. Now, only they should occupy the majority of the newspaper with their own materials, and only they should satisfy the increased demands of readers.

After drawing such an incorrect and fundamentally wrong conclusion, these newspaper workers began to say that the worker-peasant correspondent movement had begun to decline. In individual editorial departments, there are also lovers of an easy life who assert that there is no need to engage in the work of worker correspondents and rural correspondents, author activists, and no need to care about the source of letters and communications in the newspaper.

Is it necessary to prove the absurdity and error of such ideas? Only people who do not understand the nature of the Bolshevik newspaper can draw such unreasonable conclusions.

On the contrary, the improvement of our people's culture has opened up tremendous possibilities for newspapers to widely absorb author activists from workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals, enrich the content of the newspaper, and develop the newspaper's initiative. Only an editorial department that is good at absorbing a large number of authors to participate in its newspaper work can fully meet the increased demands of readers.

The worker-peasant correspondent movement exists and is developing. We can see this striking movement in the flood of letters from workers to newspaper editorial departments. We can see this movement in the rich articles and communications of Stakhanovites published daily in many newspapers. During the years of the Patriotic War, we saw the combat activities of soldier correspondents, and now we see their perfect work. Finally, we also see the worker-peasant correspondent movement in the tens of thousands of wall newspapers in factories and enterprises, collective farms, and Soviet farms.

The Party Central Committee had to seriously correct the mistakes of the newspaper editorial departments, pointing out to them the necessity of widely absorbing author activists. In the "Resolution on Improving the Quality and Expanding the Content of Newspapers in Various Republics, Border Regions, and Provinces," adopted by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1945, it was pointed out that "Newspaper editorial departments have weakened the work of contacting author activists and their own readers. Few articles are published in the newspaper by leading Party and Soviet workers, economic experts, engineers, agricultural technicians, advanced workers in industrial and agricultural economy, and scientific, cultural, and artistic workers. Some newspapers are filled with hasty, meaningless articles and communications written in a dry and tasteless bureaucratic style of instruction." ("Party Construction," 1945, Issues 13-14)

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed at that time that the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of various republics, and the Border Committees and Provincial Committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have the obligation to take measures to seriously improve the newspapers of various republics, border regions, and provinces, and in practice make the newspapers a fighting organ for the mass political education of the masses and for mobilizing the working masses to fight for the further consolidation of the strength of our socialist country, and use the newspapers in every way as the most important means for the Party to lead the masses.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) gave the following instructions in its resolution on improving the provincial newspapers "The Hammer," "The Volga Commune," and "The Kursk Truth":

"Studying how to widely absorb correspondents from workers, peasants, and intellectuals to participate in newspaper work is the most important condition for improving the newspaper and consolidating contact with the masses. It is recommended that the editorial departments and author activists organize daily work, implement holding non-editorial author activist meetings, discuss the editorial department's work plan, and hold reader meetings where the editorial department presents reports on newspaper work." ("Culture and Life," 1946, Issue 4)

The newspapers that have achieved certain improvements are those where the editorial department and the Party committee have drawn the necessary conclusions from these instructions of the Central Committee.

Recently, many people have been talking about and writing about the work experience of "The Kursk Truth," but what is most noteworthy in this experience? What methods did the Kursk Provincial Committee and the editorial department use to achieve the improvement of their newspaper? They mainly focused on non-editorial authors. Look at this newspaper. You can see more meaningful materials from agricultural economy leaders, collective farm shock brigades, leaders of three-person work groups, Party, Soviet, and economic workers. It is they who enrich the content of the newspaper with their own materials, and raise important and lively issues of agricultural, Party, and Soviet construction work in the newspaper. In order to absorb workers and rural correspondents and Party activists to participate in the work of the newspaper, the editorial department adopted a variety of mass work methods: conducting individual talks with authors, holding newspaper activist meetings in the editorial department, organizing rural correspondent stations, and so on.

"The Leningrad Truth" does a very good job of working with author activists. The editorial department's Party life group has established close contact with Party workers. A large number of their articles and communications are published. The economic group published dozens of materials on the problems of Leningrad's industrial work in early 1948. The articles by industrial sector workers always raise important and urgent issues in enterprise work and arouse enthusiastic social response. For example, engineer Semenov raised the issue of production automation and electrical mechanization in the newspaper. His article attracted the attention of many readers and aroused great interest. The editorial department received many responses to Semenov's proposals - letters and articles.

"The Leningrad Truth"'s experience of establishing "communication stations" in enterprises, uniting hundreds of worker correspondent activists, is noteworthy. There are now such "communication stations" in fifty factories. The editorial department maintains close contact with them every day. After the "communication stations" were organized, the editorial department immediately increased the source of various on-the-spot reports. The newspaper had the possibility of opening a new column "Evening in Various Enterprises in Leningrad."

When establishing "communication stations," special attention should be paid to not restricting the initiative of other workers to contribute in any way. On the contrary, the editorial department should rely on these "communication stations" to expand and deepen its contact with the broad masses of readers with their help, and absorb new and updated authors to cooperate with the newspaper.

The Saratov "Communist" newspaper has significantly improved the work of worker correspondents and activists. In 1947, the newspaper published: 124 articles and communications by collective farm chairmen, 107 by shock brigade leaders, leaders of three-person groups, and livestock farm directors, 90 by tractor drivers and combine drivers, 83 by agricultural technicians and animal breeders, 170 by tractor station chiefs and Soviet farm chairmen, 162 by worker Stakhanovites, 172 by enterprise directors and engineers, 313 by Party and Communist Youth League workers, and 62 by teachers and doctors. The editorial department received more than 12,000 articles, communications, and letters in one year.

The editorial departments of "The Hammer" (Rostov-on-Don), "The Soviet Siberia" (Novosibirsk), and "The Volga Commune" (Kuybyshev) have begun to do a great deal of work with author activists and worker-peasant correspondents.

However, in many editorial departments, there has been no change in this regard. In addition, there is often a complete neglect of the work of non-editorial activists. For example, this is the case with "The Bryansk Worker." A check conducted in March 1948 pointed out that the editorial department of the newspaper had very poor contact with worker-peasant correspondents. In many departments, author activists were treated with a contemptuous attitude.

There was a formal regulation in the editorial department, according to which the fate of each communication sent in must be determined within four days. However, many materials were left in various departments for several weeks. During the inspection, twenty-four short communications were found in the reporting group, where they had been for more than a month. There were 116 similar materials in the agricultural economy group. In other groups, there were also sharp warnings about violations of the agricultural economic cooperative charter and about the waste of socialist wealth, and articles by agricultural leaders discussing their own experiences.

Not only was there no willingness to work with author activists and worker-peasant correspondents, but even the letters from these people were not willing to be heeded. The staff of "The Bryansk Worker" editorial department tormented the authors with all kinds of bureaucratic attitudes. Here are a few such examples.

The director of the Zhukovsky District Library wrote an article to the newspaper saying how the small number of people in the library were overcoming difficulties and carrying out huge and beneficial work. This article was not published, and the author received a reply with the following content: "The editorial department of this newspaper will not publish your communication about the work of the district library: this newspaper cannot promote a library that does not yet have a complete venue."

The editorial department replied to another correspondent who reported on the opening of a district teacher conference: "Your report on the teacher conference was not published because, regrettably, there was nothing in it that other teachers could learn from, and no experience."

The head of the industrial group of the newspaper replied to a communication about the best lathe worker in the rubber factory: "The lathe worker is not a characteristic profession for the Bryansk Rubber Factory. Therefore, your description of the lathe repair could not be published in this newspaper."

The rural correspondent of the "Seventh Congress of Soviets" collective farm wrote a short message to the newspaper about the advanced three-person group of Nikolai Kuznetsov. The head of the agricultural group of the newspaper was unwilling to publish the short message of the rural correspondent, so he wrote him the following reply: "The material you sent is, on the whole, difficult to read - the names are completely incomprehensible. It is impossible to proofread by telephone. Therefore, the article was not published. Please write as clearly as possible, and I hope that in the future you will not write on both sides of the paper."

During the inspection, it was found that the rural correspondent's communication was easy to read, and all the names were clearly written.

In this way, the editorial department of "The Bryansk Worker" completely erased the matter of worker-peasant correspondents participating in newspaper work.

Sometimes it is difficult for authors to open a door on certain newspapers, as illustrated by the facts in the working style of "The Red Tatar."

The director of the Kazan Scientific Library wrote several articles and communications to the newspaper, sometimes out of personal initiative and sometimes at the request of editorial colleagues. However, none of his articles were published, although these articles were absolutely meaningful to the readers. Many meaningful materials sent by the staff of the Osoaviakhim Soviet suffered the same fate. These are the titles of several communications from the staff of the Osoaviakhim Soviet that were archived: "Shooting Competition," "Winter Hunting at its Peak," "Memoirs of River Fishing," "Young Shooters on the Front Line."

It is necessary to put an end in a thorough way to the non-Party work style of refusing authors to participate in newspaper work in certain places. We must ruthlessly eradicate bureaucratic distortions of right and wrong and formalism in newspaper work. The issue is to exert all efforts to develop the initiative and activeness of worker correspondents and rural correspondents, and to create a wide range of correspondents around the newspaper.

　　报纸编辑部的群众工作
    葛烈勃涅夫
    我们党中央非常注意改进报纸工作，提高其政治思想水平。这是从我们的党和我们的国家在目前条件下所面临的一些伟大历史任务出发的。
    苏维埃人民正在实现国民经济的重建与发展的伟大的战后斯大林计划。国内到处展开了工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子争取四年完成五年计划的社会主义的竞赛。我们的报刊——社会主义建设的强有力的武器——在人民的竞赛组织中，在动员群众为更进一步加强我们伟大祖国的威力中有着绝大的作用。
    党展开了广大的思想工作。人民政治与文化水平的提高，劳动群众共产主义的觉悟性的巩固，人类意识中资本主义残余的克服，苏维埃爱国主义的和民族自尊的教育，这些都是苏维埃社会的生活必需品。布尔塞维克报刊是掌握在党手中的有力的思想武器，劳动群众政治教育的光辉的工具，有着加强对群众教育的影响，促进党组织的一切思想工作的巩固与发展。
    现在在党组织与政治思想工作方面，党面临着巨大的任务。在解决这些任务上，报刊也有着同样重要的意义。
    所有这些都要求严肃的巩固我们的报纸，提高其政治思想水平，提高其在国内政治、经济与文化生活中的作用。
    报纸的改进，它的题材的扩大，内容的深刻，首先将依赖编辑部怎样广泛地在报纸上吸收作者积极分子来合作。从党员积极分子、工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子中吸收普遍的通讯员小组，与群众、与读者们的密切联系，是所有我们的报纸质量的生动与提高的关键。
            一
    布尔塞维克报刊，作为新型的报刊，它的特性，最重要的原则之一，就是报纸的群众性。
    列宁和斯大林教导我们，布尔塞维克党的力量——就在于和人民的广泛而密切的联系，善于倾听群众的意见并了解他们的需要，不仅是教育群众，而且向群众学习。
    斯大林同志指示说：“布尔塞维克的强有力就在于保持与自己的母亲也就是产生、抚养并教育了布尔塞维克的群众的联系。当他们与自己的母亲，与人民，保持联系时，他们就有一切的机会，成为不可战胜的。”（斯大林《论党工作的缺点和消灭托洛斯基派及其他两面分子的方法》）
    与人民的密切的经常的联系，善于每天每天地和群众谈话并反应群众的要求，这就是布尔塞维克报刊的力量之所在。
    群众性也是我们的报纸和资产阶级报纸的基本上的、原则上的区别。资产阶级报纸的使命——保护、装饰资本主义并使之适合于资本主义制度。报纸不是为人民服务，而是为剥削阶级及其利益服务的。列宁写道，资产阶级报纸是富人的通报消息的工具和欺骗与愚弄劳动人民的工具，奴役人民的工具。近来资产阶级出版机关的行为是再没有比列宁这个定义解说得更好的了。资本主义的报纸现在正服务于最放肆的、最残暴的帝国主义反动派。谎言、诽谤、阿谀成为报纸垄断与服务于他们的新闻记者们的日常的事情。
    在我国有着出版的真正的自由。苏维埃报刊是服务于列宁斯大林党的和全苏维埃人民的伟大事业——共产主义事业的。它给劳动群众培养苏维埃爱国主义和民族自尊心的高尚的感情，鼓励他们去为社会主义祖国的更进一步的增长与繁荣而斗争。不是名位也不是贪婪而是无限的忠实于自己的人民、高尚的布尔塞维克的党性、思想——这就是推动苏维埃新闻记者干部的力量并且是他们的领导的基础。
    我们报刊的群众性的原则包括如下基本的几点。
    第一，布尔塞维克报刊按其性质，按其政治目的来说，真正是群众的、人民的报刊。报刊是苏维埃社会主义民主的鲜明的表现。
    第二，我们的报刊是党与群众之间联系的最坚韧的工具，布尔塞维克领导群众的最重要的手段。
    第三，我们的报纸的群众性也在于报纸是在广大劳动人民积极参加报纸工作的基础上建立起来的。
            二
    和群众的经常的密切的联系是布尔塞维克领导的基础。党组织当前的一切工作，宣传、鼓励和组织工作，其目的都在于巩固和扩大这个联系。党直接按照不同的路线并在各种传动带的帮助之下来取得与群众的联系。
    在我们党与群众的联系中，报刊起过并且正在起着重大的作用。在无产阶级革命准备期中，为了组织工人，为了在人民中进行鼓励与宣传，为了在群众中争取自己的影响，布尔塞维克广泛地运用了报纸。
    斯大林同志于一九○一年《斗争报》创刊号社论中写道：“报纸的最重要的责任——是尽可能接近工人群众，尽可能经常影响他们，作为他们的自觉的和领导的中心。”（斯大林全集第一卷第八页）
    就是在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，在社会主义建设期中，为了加深与巩固党与人民之间的联系，报纸的意义也是同样伟大的。斯大林同志教导说，报刊，就其力量而言，等于任何群众性的传达工具，报刊在党与工人阶级之间建立了无形的联系。“报刊——这是最有力的武器，在它的帮助之下，党每日每时地、用自己的、党所需要的语言，来同工人阶级谈话，在党与阶级之间扩展精神联系的别的工具，别的类似的灵活的机关，天地之间还没有。”（斯大林全集第五卷第二百○四页）
    斯大林同志论到布尔塞维克正确领导的三个条件是：
    第一，必须找出对这个或那个问题的正确的解决，但是不考虑群众的经验，不统一两个经验：领导者的经验与人民的经验，就不能找到正确的解决。在实现这一正确领导的重要条件中，报刊的作用是非常重大的。我们的报纸登载许多论文、通讯，工人、集体农庄庄员、共产党党员、党的和经济的工作人员的来信，信中交换并综合多数人的实际工作经验，这些经验在我们的国家和经济建设中有着巨大的意义。
    正确领导的第二个重要条件就是善于组织执行所通过的决议。然而没有群众的直接帮助就不可能做到。报刊帮助党宣传决议的思想与意义达到劳动群众的广大阶层的觉悟，动员他们胜利的去实践党的这些决议。显然，这并不是说，我们的报纸就应该被一些优越的类似指令、指示的材料所充塞。报纸影响群众，以它的各种文学体裁和工作方式来教育并组织群众。它应当简单地和明白地同工人、农民、知识分子进行谈话，向他们解释党的政策，提高他们去完成党所提出的任务。
    最后，布尔塞维克正确领导的第三个条件就是工作执行的检查。然而工作执行的检查没有群众的直接帮助是不可能组织成的。在这方面除了其他的手段以外，党把报纸当作社会监督的和展开广泛的批评与自我批评的武器。
    在以苏维埃爱国主义精神，在以共产主义的最高的与高尚的原则教育劳动人民的基础上，党建立了与群众之间的联系。
    党依靠这些办法，这些精神联系，通过报刊实现与群众之间的联系。
    群众性——是布尔塞维克报刊的一切活动的基础。没有与群众之间、与读者之间、与党组织之间的广泛的和经常的联系，没有有生命力的渊博的知识，就不能够真正办好报纸。因此每日的积极的群众工作就是布尔塞维克的办报的方法。
    事实上，难道没有与群众之间、与党组织之间的经常的联系，记者的文字工作可以想像吗？显然是不可想像的。列宁教导我们，布尔塞维克报刊工作者应该做政论家所经常做的事——写近代的历史。因此报刊工作者应该这样去写历史，使得他们所写的日常生活给运动的直接参加者带来应有的帮助；应该这样写历史，使得他们所写的能帮助运动的直接参加者自觉地选择斗争的手段、技巧与方法，用最小的力量收获最大的和最巩固的结果。
    只有在报纸工作者很好地了解了生活，经常与人民保持巩固的联系的条件之下，他们才能够胜利地完成这个任务。为了积极地帮助共产主义的建设者，就必须细心地研究他们的英勇劳动，在我们生活中发现一切新的、进步的事物，在工人中、农民中、知识分子中宣传社会主义生产中革新者所发现的劳动活动中的最好的技术与方法。要求于布尔塞维克记者的是生活的严肃的知识，他应该经常处在党所生活着的、人民群众所生活着的这些事件的中心。布尔塞维克报纸工作者比任何人都更要面向群众，在社会主义建设中细心地研究群众的创造经验，党组织的多方面的活动。
    报纸工作者不只为自己的文字工作需要这些联系，他们首先要经常地尽可能更多地从工人中、集体农庄庄员中、知识分子中吸收通讯员来和报纸合作。
    布尔塞维克报刊永远建立在劳动人民自己广泛参加报刊工作的基础上。我党伟大的创始者和领袖列宁和斯大林，后来又是布尔塞维克报纸的第一个编辑，给我们以怎样办好群众的政治报刊的光辉的范例。为列宁和斯大林所领导的报刊永远以从工人中、党的工作人员中、普通党员中积极吸收报纸通讯员为最独特的一点。这一类报纸有《火星报》和《斗争报》，《前进报》和《无产者报》，《无产阶级斗争报》和《时代报》，《明星报》和《真理报》。
    前世纪末一八九九年列宁指出：“……在我们的工人中传布给社会主义报纸写业余的通讯的最好的习惯。……”（列宁全集第四卷第二百七十一页，第四版）
    后来，在《做什么》一书中乌拉基米尔·依里奇指出，甚至在最落后的工人中都发展了真正的“发表”欲——一种高尚的欲望。（列宁全集第五卷第三百六十九页，第四版）
    果然不错，工人参加布尔塞维克报刊工作的数量一年比一年增多了。在《真理报》出版第二年全年（一九一三——一九一四）二百七十份报纸中，刊登了一万一千多篇工人通讯，亦即每一份报纸上平均有四十多篇通讯，就是一个很好的说明。
            三
    伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，工人、农民和知识分子更大规模地参加了我们的报刊。在广大的苏维埃国家的各个角落里都展开了工农通讯员运动。给报纸寄业余的通讯在我们的人民中已经成为日常生活习惯了。高尚的发表欲在劳动群众中更加巩固起来了。
    在这些年代里，工农通讯员运动在苏维埃报刊的发展与巩固中，在社会主义建设事业中，起了绝大的作用。斯大林称工人和农村通讯员为工农报纸的建设者。工人通讯员和农村通讯员是社会主义的积极建设者。在工厂中、作坊中、建设中，他们是生产的先进者，在农村中是为集体农庄而奋斗的不倦的战士。在写给报纸的信件中，工农通讯员大胆地揭穿了阶级敌人的阴谋，公开地批评了缺点。党永远热心地倾听着工人与农村通讯员，这些无产阶级社会舆论领导者的呼声。
    现在，在为实现更进一步发展国民经济与伟大的斯大林的重建纲领而斗争的时候，在我们的报纸工作中，在我国社会政治生活中，工农通讯员运动像以前一样地起着巨大的作用。
    和我们国内经济与文化增长的同时，工农通讯员运动也生长了，扩大了。现在的工农通讯员运动与苏维埃最初几年的工农通讯员运动有着本质的不同。事实上在这个时期中，我国人民的文化水平也大大提高了。脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的矛盾正在日趋消灭中。现在，在工厂和企业、集体农庄、苏维埃农场和拖拉机站，有不少的人是受过七年制中学、中等和高等教育的。国内增加了几百万的苏维埃知识分子的胜利军。
    国内所发生的伟大的社会主义改革、文化革命，把我们报刊的积极分子的面貌也改变了。谁是我们现在的工人和农村通讯员呢？是工业和农业经济的斯达哈诺夫运动者，技术上成熟的、掌握了对新鲜事物的敏锐感觉的人、生产革新者。现在的工人与农村通讯员——是有着广阔的文化与政治视野的人们，党和非党的布尔塞维克；社会批评和自我批评的引导者，大胆地出来反对坏的和不够格的事物，反对人们意识中的资本主义的残余；这是我们社会中的先进的以共产主义态度对待劳动的模范人物。现在的工人和农村通讯员就是这样的。
    可惜某些报纸工作人员还不了解在工农通讯员运动中所发生的变化。从文化革命的事实中，个别同志恰恰做出了相反的结论来。他们差不多是这样想的：由于苏维埃人民的文化水平的增长，于是读者对报纸的要求也高了，因此首先要明确走向文艺家和职业记者的方向。现在只有他们应该用自己的材料在报纸上占绝大地位，只有他们应该去满足提高了的读者的要求。
    做出这样不正确的、根本错误的结论以后，这些报纸工作者开始说什么工农通讯员运动已开始走下坡路了。在个别的编辑部里还发现轻松生活的爱好者，他们断定现在用不着搞工人通讯员和农村通讯员、作者积极分子的工作了，用不着再关心报纸上信件和通讯的来源了。
    还用得着证明类似这些想法的无聊和错误吗？只有不了解布尔塞维克报刊本性的人们才能够得出这种不合理的结论来。
    恰恰相反，我国人民的文化的提高在报纸的面前打开了在工人中、在集体农庄庄员中和在知识分子中广泛吸收作者积极分子、丰富报纸内容、开展报纸主动性的巨大的可能性。只有那种善于吸收大量作者来参加自己的报纸工作的编辑部才能充分地满足提高了的读者的要求。
    工农通讯员运动存在着并发展着。我们在给报纸编辑部的劳动者来信的洪流中，可以看出这个触目的运动。我们从许多报纸上每天刊登的斯达哈诺夫运动者的内容丰富的论文和通讯中，可以看到这个运动。在卫国战争的年代中，我们看到战士通讯员的战斗活动，现在又看到他们的完美的工作。最后我们在工厂和企业的、集体农庄和苏维埃农场的几万种墙报中，我们也看到工农通讯员运动。
    党的中央委员会不得不严肃地纠正报纸编辑部的错误，给他们指出广泛吸收作者积极分子的必要性。在一九四五年联共（布）党中央委员会所通过的《关于各共和国、各边疆与各省级报纸质量的改进和内容的扩大的决议》中，指出“报纸编辑部削弱了对作者积极分子与自己读者联系的工作。在报上很少登载领导的党的和苏维埃的工作人员、经济专家、工程师、农业技师、工业和农业经济中的先进工作者、科学文化艺术工作者的论文。某些报纸被潦草的、毫无意义的、以干燥无味的事务主义的指示体裁所写成的一些论文和通讯所充塞了。”（《党的建设》一九四五年第十三—十四期）
    联共（布）党中央委员会指示当时各共和国共产党中央委员会，联共（布）党各边疆委员会与各省委会有义务采取措施严肃的改进各共和国、各边疆与各省的报纸，在实际中使报纸成为群众的政治教育和动员劳动群众为更进一步巩固我们的社会主义国家的力量而斗争的战斗的机关，以一切方法利用报纸为党领导群众的最重要的手段。
    联共（布）党中央委员会关于改进省级报纸《铁锤报》，《伏尔加公社报》及《库尔斯克真理报》的决议中，给了如下的指示：
    “研究从工人中、农民中与知识分子中广泛吸收通讯员来参加报纸工作，是改进报纸和巩固与群众的联系的最重要的条件，建议各报编辑部和作者积极分子组织日常工作，实行召开非编辑部作者积极分子会议，讨论编辑部的工作计划，并召开由编辑提出关于报纸工作报告的读者会议。”（《文化与生活》一九四六年第四期）
    那里的编辑部和党委会从中央委员会的这些指示中做出了必要的结论，那里的报纸就达到了一定的改进。
    最近以来许多人在谈及并写了关于《库尔斯克真理报》的工作经验，但是在这一经验中什么是最值得注意的呢？库尔斯克省委会与编辑部用什么办法达到了自己报纸的改进呢？他们主要的抓紧了非编辑部的作者。请看看这个报纸吧。你们可以看到那上面更多的农业经济方面的先进分子的，集体农庄突击小组、三人工作小组的领导者的，党、苏维埃及经济工作者的有意义的材料。就是他们用自己的材料充实了报纸的内容，在报纸上提出了农业的、党与苏维埃建设工作的重要的生气勃勃的问题。为了在报纸上吸收工人和农村通讯员与党积极分子参加工作，编辑采用了各种各样的群众工作方式：与作者进行个别谈话，在编辑部举行报纸积极分子会议，组织农村通讯站等等。
    《列宁格勒真理报》对作者积极分子工作做得很好。编辑部党的生活组与党工作人员建立了密切的联系。大量地刊登他们的论文与通讯。经济组于一九四八年初刊登了几十篇关于列宁格勒市工业工作问题的材料。工业部门工作人员的论文，总是把企业工作中重要的、迫切的问题提出来并引起热烈的社会反应。例如，工程师谢米诺夫在报上提出关于生产自动化和电气机械化的问题。他的论文便引起了许多读者的注意并唤起了很大的兴趣。编辑部得到不少对谢米诺夫的提议的反应——来信和论文。
    《列宁格勒真理报》关于在企业中建立“通讯站”、团结了成百的工人通讯员积极分子的经验是值得注意的。现在在五十个工厂里已经有了这种《通讯站》。编辑部和他们每天都保持着密切的联系。在《通讯站》组织成以后，编辑部马上就增加了各种现地报道的来源。报纸得到了开辟新的专栏“晚间在列宁格勒城各企业中”的可能性。
    在建立“通讯站”时，应该特别注意无论如何不要束缚其他工人投稿的主动性。相反地，编辑部应该依靠这些“通讯站”，在他们的帮助之下扩大并加深自己和广大读者群众的联系，吸收新的和更新的作者来和报纸合作。
    沙拉托夫《共产党员报》显著地改善了对工人通讯员，对积极分子的工作。在一九四七年，该报发表的论文和通讯，计：集体农庄主席——一百二十四篇，突击小组长、三人小组长和牲畜饲养所主任——一○七篇，拖拉机驾驶员和联合机驾驶员——九○篇，农业技师和动物饲养家——八十三篇，拖拉机站长与苏维埃农场主席——一七○篇，工人斯达哈诺夫运动者——一六二篇，企业主任和工程师——一百七十二篇，党和共青团工作人员——三百十三篇，教员和医生——六十二篇。编辑部在一年中收到一万二千余篇论文、通讯和来信。
    《铁锤报》（顿河罗斯托夫），《苏维埃西伯利亚报》（新西伯利亚），《伏尔加公社报》（古比雪夫）等报编辑部已经开始对作者积极分子与工农通讯员进行巨大的工作。
    然而在许多编辑部中，在这方面还没有发生变化。此外还经常发现根本忽视对非编辑部积极分子工作的。例如，《布利安斯克工人报》就是这样。一九四八年三月中所进行的检查曾指出，该报编辑部对工农通讯员的联系是非常不好的。在许多部门里，对待非编辑部通讯作者们抱着轻视的态度。
    在编辑部里曾经形式地有过一项规定，根据这个规定，必须在四天之内确定寄来的每一篇通讯的命运。然而有许多材料在各部门一搁就是几个星期。在检查时，在报道组发现了二十四篇短篇通讯，放在那里已经一个多月了。在农业经济组类似的材料有一百一十六份。在其他各组还有关于违犯农业经济组合章程，关于浪费社会主义财富的尖锐的警告，农业先进者论述本身经验的论文。
    不但不愿意对作者积极分子、工农通讯员进行工作，连这些人的来信都不愿意理会，《布利安斯克工人报》编辑部工作人员以一切官僚主义态度的回答来折磨作者。下面就是几个这样的例子。
    儒可夫斯基区图书馆主任给该报写了一篇文章说到，该馆为数不多的全体同人怎样克服了困难，正在进行着巨大的和有益的工作。这篇文章没有问世，而作者收到了一封如下内容的回答：“本报编辑部将不刊登您的关于区图书馆工作的通讯：本报不能为一个至今还没有完备的馆址的图书馆作宣传。”
    编辑部回答另一个报道区教员会议开幕的通讯员说：“您的关于教员会议的报道没有发表出来，因为其中很遗憾地没有一点值得其他教员借镜的地方，没有一点经验。”
    该报工业组组长给报道关于橡胶厂最好的旋盘工人的一篇通讯的回答是：“旋盘工——对于布利安斯克橡胶厂不是一个有特性的职业。因此您的关于旋盘修理的描写未能在本报刊出。”
    “苏维埃第七次代表大会”集体农庄的农村通讯员给该报写了一篇关于尼古拉·库兹涅佐夫的先进三人小组的短讯。该报农业组组长不愿意刊登农村通讯员的短讯，就给他写了如下的回答：“您所寄来的材料，整个说来是很难读的，——姓名完全弄不明白。用电话来校对又不可能。因此文章就没有登出。请尽可能写清楚，并希望以后不要在稿纸上两面书写。”
    在检查时发现农村通讯员的通讯是很容易读的，所有的姓名写得也清清楚楚。
    这样，《布利安斯克工人报》编辑部就把工农通讯员参加报纸工作一事一笔勾消了。
    有时在某些报纸上作者们很难打开一条门路，《红色鞑靼报》的工作作风中的事实，也说明了这一点。
    喀桑科学图书馆馆长几次给报纸写论文和通讯；有时是由于个人的主动性，有时是由于编辑同人的要求而写的。然而他的文章没有一篇问世过，虽然这些文章对读者来说，是绝对有意义的。奥索阿维阿希玛苏维埃工作人员寄来的许多有意义的材料，也遭到了同样的命运。这就是奥索阿维阿希玛苏维埃工作人员的几篇归了档的通讯的标题：《射击竞赛》，《冬季打猎在高潮中》，《江湖垂钓记》，《在火线上的青年射击手》。
    必须以彻底的方式结束某些地方拒绝作者参加报纸工作的非党作风。必须无情地铲除报纸工作中的官僚主义的颠倒是非和形式主义。问题就在于以一切的力量发挥工人通讯员与农村通讯员的积极性和主动性，在报纸周围创造广泛的通讯员积极分子。（下期续完）
