    High Efficiency of the Mud Drilling Bucket

    Zhangjiakou Water Company Completes First Water Source Well Dredging Project, Saving Over 30,000 Jin of Millet

    [Reported by this newspaper] Zhangjiakou Water Company, in order to save electricity and dredge well mud, proposed the slogan "No Electricity, Save Expenses" at the beginning of last month, mobilizing employees to create new well dredging tools. Technician Zhang Wenqi responded to the call and created a "Mud Drilling Bucket" with good dredging results. The company immediately used Zhang Wenqi's "Mud Drilling Bucket" (details in this newspaper's March 26th edition) to dredge the mud and sand from the wells, and has now completed the mud dredging project for the three wells at the first water source, Gushicun. According to precise calculations, this saved 31,366 jin of millet compared to using electricity, exceeding the initial estimate of saving 16,400 jin of millet by nearly double. The project started on March 10th, and thanks to the high working efficiency of the mud drilling bucket and the active work of the workers, all dredging tasks were completed by the 25th. A total of 411.5 workdays were used, which was not only more thorough than the original plan of using electric pumps and manual dredging, but also saved over 31,300 jin of millet. For this reason, at the well dredging work summary meeting on April 3rd, in addition to praising Zhang Wenqi's creative spirit, the company also awarded him 469 jin of millet.

　　钻泥斗效率高
    张市自来水公司完成第一水源掏井工程，节省小米三万余斤。
    【本报讯】张家口自来水公司为节省电力，掏挖井泥，曾于上月初提出“不用电力，节省开支”的口号，发动职工创造新的掏井工具。技工张文起响应号召，创制了一种“钻泥斗”，掏挖效果良好。该公司即运用张文起所创造之“钻泥斗”（详情见三月二十六日本版），掏挖井下泥沙，现已完成了第一水源孤石村的三眼水井的掏泥工程。据精确计算，较用电力节省小米三万一千三百六十六斤，超过当时估计的节省小米一万六千四百余斤的近一倍。工程于三月十日开始，由于钻泥斗工作效率高，加之工友们积极工作，至二十五日即完成全部掏泥任务。总计用工四一一·五个，较原计划用电力抽水、人工掏泥既能深入彻底，且节省开支小米三万一千三百余斤。为此，该公司于四月三日掏井工作总结大会上，除表扬张文起的创造精神外，并奖给小米四百六十九斤。
