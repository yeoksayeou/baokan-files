Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to a report in today's Guangming Daily, Minister of Justice Shi Liang made a statement to the newspaper's reporter on the 15th regarding the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China.

In her statement, Minister Shi first pointed out that this marriage law is not only progressive but also revolutionary. The basic spirit of this marriage law is to actively support women, protect children, and destroy feudal remnants in practice. Gender inequality has existed for thousands of years. To move from inequality to equality, it is not enough to stipulate equality in form. It is necessary to redouble efforts to support women who are actually in an unequal position in order to truly achieve gender equality. Marriage cases account for the majority of civil cases accepted by courts in various regions, which shows that the formulation of the marriage law is indeed completely suitable for the needs of the objective environment. After liberation, the people's awareness has generally increased, and women in particular are more eager to break free from the shackles of unreasonable marriages. The main reason is that after the land reform, rural women generally received land, which improved their economic status and made them no longer solely dependent on men. The formulation of this marriage law timely guaranteed the improved economic status of women in the old liberated areas. The characteristic of this marriage law is that it not only establishes a system but also fully demonstrates the spirit of the Central People's Government's policy of gender equality. The fact that it is now called "Marriage Law" instead of "Marriage Regulations" also shows the government's emphasis on this issue. This marriage law can be said to include the opinions of all aspects and strata of the country. It takes into account both urban and rural areas, and both women and men, fully grasping the spirit of democracy.

Key Points of Each Chapter of the Marriage Law

Next, Minister Shi pointed out the key points of each chapter of the Marriage Law. She said: The first chapter mainly explains that the principle of the Marriage Law is to abolish all feudal, unreasonable, and oppressive marriage systems against women, implement freedom of marriage, establish monogamy, gender equality, and protect women and children.

The second chapter, "Marriage," has a total of four articles, and its basic spirit lies in the voluntary consent of both men and women. Therefore, it is specifically stated that one party is not allowed to be coerced or interfered with by others. The provisions regarding the age of marriage and the prohibition of marriage not only ensure the happiness of married life but also pay attention to the health of the next generation. Marriage should be registered, but only at the local township government, which on the one hand shows that marriage must be solemn, and on the other hand, it also eliminates all the red tape of the past feudal marriage system.

The third chapter is about the rights and obligations between husband and wife, such as equal status in the family, freedom to choose a career, participate in work, and participate in social activities, and equal ownership and disposal rights over family property. These are all specific provisions for the rights of gender equality, and they are all more helpful to women.

The fourth chapter, the relationship between parents and children, is mainly a provision for the protection of children, such as strictly prohibiting infanticide, which means that infants are protected by law from birth. The infants who are drowned are almost all female, which shows the thoroughness of the protection of women. Article 15 specifically stipulates that children born out of wedlock enjoy the same rights as children born in wedlock, which more specifically demonstrates the anti-feudal basic spirit of the entire marriage law.

The fifth chapter, "Divorce," is the chapter with the most debate during discussions. According to the principle of freedom of marriage, marriage should be free, and divorce should naturally be free as well. The Marriage Law stipulates that when one party insists on divorce, mediation procedures must be followed. This is only to help both parties consider more and not divorce easily, so as not to create a casual attitude towards marriage, but it does not prevent the oppressed from achieving their desire to escape suffering. Special provisions for the divorce of active-duty revolutionary soldiers are very important and should be made.

The sixth chapter, "Custody and Education of Children After Divorce," mainly protects children so that they will not suffer misfortunes such as dropping out of school or living without support due to the divorce of their parents. Article 20 first stipulates that the blood relationship between parents and children does not disappear due to the divorce of parents, which mainly corrects the tragic phenomenon of children often becoming fatherless or motherless when their parents divorce in the past.

The seventh chapter, "Property and Life After Divorce," not only protects the rights and interests of women and children but also proposes that the judgment principle should be conducive to the development of production, which is completely in line with our economic construction requirements today.

The additional provisions in the last chapter take into account the specific circumstances of ethnic minorities, which is also completely necessary. This is a concrete manifestation of the ethnic minority policy in the Common Program.

How to Ensure Effective Implementation

Regarding the question of how to ensure the effective implementation of the Marriage Law after its promulgation, Minister Shi pointed out that this is a progressive, revolutionary, and major law that reasonably solves problems based on objective needs, and it must be implemented article by article and word by word. This requires the cooperation and efforts of all parties. She believes that we should first start with publicity and education work. Relevant agencies, mass organizations, especially women's organizations, must closely contact the district and township people's governments and county and city people's courts to assist them in understanding problems and handling disputes. Minister Shi emphasized that many issues in the Marriage Law must be mastered by the courts. For example, when mediation is ineffective when one party is determined to divorce, when there is a dispute between both parties who are willing to raise children after divorce, and when there is no agreement on how to handle family property after divorce, the court is required to make a judgment. This requires that county and city people's courts correctly grasp the basic spirit of the Marriage Law when handling marriage disputes. Therefore, she believes that all judicial cadres, especially county-level judicial cadres, should specially study and learn about this Marriage Law so that they will not make mistakes or biases when handling problems. As for women themselves, she believes that they should step up their studies, publicize the spirit of this decree, and establish correct and happy marriage concepts, so that sisters who are immersed in the bitter sea of feudal marriage can also correctly break free under the guarantee of this Marriage Law and strive together with men to promote social progress and national prosperity.

　　史良部长谈婚姻法
    指出基本精神是在实际上积极扶助妇女，保护儿童，摧毁封建残余。
    【新华社十六日讯】据此间光明日报今日载：司法部史良部长于十五日对该报记者发表关于中华人民共和国婚姻法的谈话。
    在谈话中，史部长首先指出：这个婚姻法不仅是进步的，而且是革命的。这部婚姻法的基本精神是在实际上积极扶植妇女，保护儿童，摧毁封建残余。男女不平等已几千年了，要从不平达到平，绝不是形式上规定平等就可以达到的，必须加倍扶植实际处在不平地位的妇女，才能真正走向男女平等。各地法院所受理民事案件中，婚姻案都占多数，可以说明婚姻法的制定确实完全适合客观环境的需要。解放后，人民的觉悟普遍提高了，特别是妇女更迫切要求挣脱不合理婚姻的枷锁。主要的原因是由于土地改革后，一般农村妇女也分得了土地，提高了自己的经济地位，再不单纯倚赖男人。这部婚姻法的制定适时保障了老解放区已经提高的妇女经济地位。这部婚姻法的特点是，不仅确定了一个制度，而且充分表现出中央人民政府对男女平等政策的精神。现在不称“婚姻条例”而称“婚姻法”，也说明了政府对这个问题的重视。这个婚姻法可以说是包括了全国各方面各阶层意见在内的。既照顾了城市，又照顾了乡村；既照顾了妇女，也照顾了男子，充分掌握了民主的精神。
    婚姻法各章要点
    接着，史部长就婚姻法的全文逐章指出了它的要点。她说：第一章主要是说明婚姻法的原则为废除一切封建的、不合理的、压迫妇女的婚姻制度，实行婚姻自由，确定一夫一妻，男女平等和保护妇女儿童。
    第二章为“结婚”，共四条，基本精神在于男女双方自愿。所以特别指明不许一方加以强迫和别人干涉。至于结婚年龄的规定和禁止结婚的规定，则不但保证了婚姻生活的美满，更注意到后一代的健康。结婚应该登记，但只要在所在地区乡政府即可，这一方面说明了婚姻必须郑重，一方面也铲除了过去封建婚姻制度的一切繁文缛节。
    第三章是关于夫妻间的权利和义务的，像在家庭中地位平等，均有选择职业、参加工作和参加社会活动的自由，对于家庭财产有平等的所有权、处理权，这都是具体规定出男女平等的权利，而且都更有助于妇女。
    第四章父母子女间的关系主要是保护儿童的规定，如严禁溺婴，就是使婴儿从初生起就受到法律的保护；而被的溺婴儿几乎都是女性，这又表示出对妇女保护的彻底。第十五条特别规定非婚生子女与婚生子女享有同等权利，更具体表现出整个婚姻法反封建的基本精神。
    第五章“离婚”，是讨论时争论最多的一章。根据婚姻自由的原则，结婚应该自由，离婚自然也应该自由。婚姻法规定，一方坚持离婚时必须经过调解手续。这只是帮助双方更多考虑，而不轻易离婚，以致造成对婚姻采取随便的态度，但又不妨碍被压迫者要求解脱痛苦的愿望能够达到。对现役革命军人的离婚有特别规定，是非常重要和应该的。
    第六章“离婚后子女的抚养和教育”，主要在保护儿童，使不致因父母离婚而造成失学或生活无着等不幸。第二十条首先规定父母与子女不因父母离婚而消失血亲关系，主要是纠正过去子女在父母离婚时所常造成的有父无母或有母无父的悲惨现象。
    第七章“离婚后的财产和生活”，不但保护了妇女与儿童的权益，而且提出判决原则应是有利发展生产，是完全符合我们今天经济建设要求的。
    最末一章附则中照顾到少数民族的具体情况也是完全必要的，这正是共同纲领中少数民族政策的具体表现。
    如何保证切实执行
    关于婚姻法颁布后应该怎样保证切实执行的问题，史部长指出，这是一部进步的、革命的、根据客观需要来合理解决问题的大法，必须要逐条逐字地使其实现。而这是必须各方面配合努力的。她以为首先应从宣传教育工作入手，各有关机关、群众团体，特别是妇女团体必须密切和区乡人民政府、县市人民法院联系，协助其了解问题，处理纠纷。史部长着重地说：在婚姻法中有许多问题主要还是要法院去掌握。如对一方坚决离婚调解无效时、离婚后双方均愿抚养子女发生争执不能协议时，和离婚后家庭财产如何处理协议不成时，都规定由法院判决。这就必须县市人民法院在处理婚姻纠纷时，能正确掌握婚姻法的基本精神。所以：她认为：所有司法干部特别是县级司法干部对这部婚姻法应特别加以研究学习，才不会在处理问题时发生错误与偏向。至于妇女本身，她以为更应加紧学习，宣传这个法令的精神，树立起正确幸福的婚姻观念，使沉浸在封建婚姻的苦海中的姊妹，也能正确地在这婚姻法的保证下挣脱出来，和男性一起为促进社会进步、国家富强而奋斗。
