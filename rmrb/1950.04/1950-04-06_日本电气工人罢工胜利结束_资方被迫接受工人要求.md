Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: The strike of Japanese electrical workers, which began on March 9th, has ended after forcing capitalists to agree to wage increases. According to Associated Press and Kyodo News Agency reports from Tokyo: after the Japan Electrical Workers' Union issued a directive to begin the fifth wave of rolling blackouts on March 29th, the Japanese government and capitalists were deeply alarmed. Kyodo News Agency stated: "If a solution is not found quickly, worrying things will happen." The Japanese government and capitalists, "in order to avoid the deterioration of the situation," partially accepted the workers' demand for wage increases on March 30th, increasing the monthly base wage of electrical workers from 7,200 yen to 8,500 yen (the union's initial demand was 12,000 yen). Capitalists were also forced to agree to pay workers a special allowance of 6,850 yen for the period from February to March of this year and the second half of last year. Subsequently, the union issued instructions to members throughout Japan to end the strike, concluding the three-week-long action.

According to Kyodo News Agency, the Central Struggle Committee of the Japan Coal Miners' Union Federation discussed the struggle policy after being forced to end the strike on March 30th and decided to refuse overtime work starting April 1st. The committee has issued this decision to all branches.

　　日本电气工人罢工胜利结束
    资方被迫接受工人要求
    【新华社五日讯】日本电气工人自三月九日起开始的罢工，已因迫使资方答应增加工资而结束。综合美联社、共同社东京讯：在日本电气工人工会发出指令，自三月二十九日开始第五次波浪式停电罢工之后，日本政府及资方深为恐慌。共同社称：“若不赶紧设法解决，便将发生可忧虑的事情”。日本政府及资方“为了避免事态恶化起见”，乃于三月三十日部分接受了工人增加工资的要求，将电气工人的每月基准工资由七千二百日元增加到八千五百日元（按工会最初要求为一万二千日元）。资方同时被迫应允发给工人今年二月至三月期间及去年下半年的特别津贴共六千八百五十日元。随后，工会方面即向全日各地会员发出停止罢工的指令，结束坚持三周的罢工。
    又据共同社消息，日本煤矿工人工会联合会中央斗争委员会，于三月三十日讨论被迫停止罢工后的斗争方针，决定自四月一日起拒绝加班工作，委员会已将此决定向各分会发出指令。
