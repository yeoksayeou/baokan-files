　　Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, April 21st: The Xuzhou Municipal People's Government and the trade union are adopting various methods to solve the problems of unemployed workers' livelihoods and the current difficulties faced by industry and commerce. Before liberation, Xuzhou was a military base for the Kuomintang. Industries such as transportation, bathhouses, hotels, and restaurants, which prospered based on this characteristic, have declined after liberation. For example, the transportation industry has decreased from 194 companies to 43; the original 23 bathhouses are now in a state of semi-shutdown. At the same time, Xuzhou is adjacent to disaster areas, and the purchasing power of farmers is extremely low, so many industrialists and businessmen are struggling to survive. Only kerosene, ironware, and bamboo industries have seen improved business due to entering the peak season. The current difficulties encountered by Xuzhou's industry and commerce are mainly concentrated in the commercial sector. According to statistics, among the industrial and commercial households that applied for closure in February and March of this year, commercial households accounted for 88 percent, while industrial households accounted for only 12 percent.

　　In resolving the current problems of unemployed workers' livelihoods and difficulties in industrial and commercial operations, the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government and the trade union mainly adopted the following methods: First, for industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood or can continue to operate, methods are adopted that rely on workers and shop assistants to help the capitalists improve operations and save expenses. Many shop assistants have now automatically lowered their living standards to reduce the capitalists' expenses, such as changing from refined grains to coarse grains, extending bathing and haircutting intervals, and reducing the use of lighting. As a result of these improvements, the daily expenses of Xinlun Cloth Store have decreased by one-fourth. The owner of Longzhang Printing and Stationery Store also greatly improved production efficiency by accepting the workers' correct suggestions. One box of ink used to print 8,000 copies, but now it can print 30,000 copies; in the past, 100 sheets were damaged when printing one ream of paper, but now only 100 sheets are damaged when printing 24 reams. Secondly, the People's Government also allocated grain to flour mills for processing and helped the salt industry organize joint transportation to maintain their production. For workers and shop assistants who have already lost their jobs, the government and trade union actively help them change careers or use the method of work-for-relief to stabilize their lives. In March, more than 1,000 cotton textile workers were organized to weave cloth for the Xuzhou Municipal Trading Company; in addition, more than 1,400 workers in the clothing, shoemaking, and construction industries were organized to participate in production in Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and other places; some bathhouse workers have changed careers; and some unemployed shop assistants have returned to the countryside. In addition, mutual aid among workers and shop assistants has also achieved considerable results. Handicraft workers have donated more than 2,300 jin of grain; shop workers in the local and Western medicine industries have also donated more than 248,000 yuan in cash.

　　In order to prevent some capitalists from illegally and forcibly dismissing workers under the pretext of current difficulties, the Xuzhou Municipal Labor Bureau stipulated in mid-March of this year that all factories and stores that dismiss workers and shop assistants due to changing careers or reducing the scope of business (requiring certification from the Industry and Commerce Bureau) should report truthfully and in detail to the Labor Bureau for review, and it is strictly forbidden to dismiss them without approval.

    徐州解决工人失业问题
    并帮助工商业者改善经营克服困难
    【新华社徐州二十一日电】徐州市人民政府和工会正采取各种方法解决失业工人的生活和工商业目前面临的困难等问题。徐州解放前是国民党军事基地，根据这一特点而繁荣一时的运输业、浴业、旅馆、饭馆等，解放后转入萧条。如运输业即由一百九十四家减到四十三家；原有的二十三户浴业现在亦处于半歇业状态。同时，徐市邻近灾区，农民购买力极低，不少工商业者亦是勉强维持。只有煤油、铁器、竹业等因走上旺月而营业好转。徐州工商业目前所遇困难，以商业为重。据统计今年二三月中呈请歇业的工商户中，商业户占百分之八十八，工业户只占百分之十二。
    徐州市人民政府和工会在解决目前失业工人生活问题和工商业经营困难时，主要采取以下办法：首先是对于有利国计民生或尚可继续维持的行业，采取依靠工人店员帮助资方改善经营、节约开支的方法。许多店员现在已自动降低了生活水准，减少资方开支，如细粮改吃粗粮，洗澡理发时间延长，减少用灯等。由于这些改进，如新纶布店每日开支即减少了四分之一。隆章印刷文具店老板也因接受了工人的正确建议，生产效率大为提高，一盒油墨过去印八千份，现可印三万份；过去印一令纸损坏一百张，现在印二十四令才损坏一百张。其次，人民政府并拨粮给面粉厂加工，帮助盐业组织联运，以维持其生产。对于已失业的工人店员，政府和工会则积极帮助其转业或用以工代赈办法安定其生活；三月份中即组织了千余棉织业工人代徐州市贸易公司织布；另组织了被服、制鞋、建筑等业共一千四百余工人到郑州、上海等地参加生产；浴业工人已有一部转业；一部失业店员则已返回乡村。此外，工人店员中的互济也得到相当效果。手工业工人共捐出粮食二千三百多斤；南货、西药业的店员工人亦捐出现金二十四万八千多元。
    为了防止某些资方借口当前困难非法强行解雇工人，徐州市劳动局于今年三月中规定所有工厂商店因转业或缩小营业范围（需有工商局证明文件）而解雇工人店员时，应向劳动局据实详报以凭审核，严禁不经批准擅自解雇。
