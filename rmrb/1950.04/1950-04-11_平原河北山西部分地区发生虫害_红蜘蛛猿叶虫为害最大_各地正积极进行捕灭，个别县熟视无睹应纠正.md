    Insect Pests Plague Parts of Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan Provinces
    Spider Mites and Willow Leaf Beetles Cause the Most Damage
    Active Efforts to Eradicate the Pests are Underway, Neglect by Some Counties Should be Corrected
    [Reported by this Newspaper] Insect pests have occurred in Pingyuan Province from the end of February to the end of March. There are more than ten kinds, including willow leaf beetles, locusts, grub worms, cabbage maggots, cockchafer larvae, wireworms (click beetle larvae), spider mites, and white fleshy worms that eat wheat seedlings (a type of noctuid moth larvae). The willow leaf beetles in rapeseed fields are the most damaging. Currently, in 144 villages in more than ten counties including Puyang, Neihuang, Hua County, Xiuwu, and Yanjin, the affected area is approximately 30,000 mu, with ten to one hundred insects on each plant, and more than 6,000 mu of rapeseed seedlings have already been destroyed. Some other insect pests have been eliminated, while others are still expanding their area of ​​damage. Generally, all areas are paying attention to capturing and eliminating the above insect pests. After discovering insect pests, Puyang County reported to the higher authorities on the one hand, and organized the masses to carry out large-scale capture and elimination on the other hand. Wuzhi County has established an insect control headquarters and insect catching teams. Ji County and Anyang are also concentrating their efforts on organizing the masses to capture and eliminate the pests. In addition, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has also successively sent cadres carrying eighty sprayers and 1,100 jin of Dithane to the countryside to assist in capturing and eliminating the pests, and within three days, more than 400 mu of seriously affected land was eliminated. However, some counties such as Xiuwu and Yanjin are only busy with ending the land reform work and are turning a blind eye to the current insect pests, resulting in the spread of the insect pests. The leaders of these counties should immediately and urgently mobilize to lead the masses in capturing and eliminating the pests. (Yu Zi)
    [Reported by this Newspaper] Spider mites and other insect pests have occurred in the Cang County District and Ding County District of Hebei Province. Wheat fields in six counties in the Cang County District, including Jiahe, Suning, Renqiu, and Jianguo, have successively experienced spider mites. In the Ding County District, not only spider mites have occurred in nine counties of Raoyang, Anping, Boye, Quyang, Wuji, Xinle, Yuanze, and Anguo, but also green maggots and locust nymphs. As of March 30, the insect pests in the six counties of the Cang County District had developed to twenty districts and more than two hundred villages. In areas severely affected by fire mites, wheat seedlings have turned yellow. At the junction of Suning, Hejian, and Xian County, there are more than 1,600 mu of wheat fields, with dozens of spider mites on each wheat seedling. Anping and Boye counties in the Ding County District are the most seriously affected. Both special district offices have issued urgent instructions, calling on all counties to immediately mobilize the strength of the masses and organize administrative and technical cadres to jointly carry out eradication. Currently, Suning, Xian County, Anping and other counties in the district have sent main cadres to personally lead the eradication of insect pests. The development of insect pests in Xian County and Suning has stopped. However, some counties still have a slighting attitude towards insect pests. For example, after the occurrence of insect pests in Jianguo, Renqiu, and Jiahe counties, some only sent one agricultural technical cadre to the insect-infested areas for inspection, and some even only issued a notice, resulting in the spread of insect pests. The special district office has now instructed to correct this. (Wang Wanguo and Cui Jinxiang from the Cang County District Office.

    [Reported by this Newspaper] In late March, spider mites and cutworms were found in wheat fields in Shihe Village, the Third District of Jiexiu County, Yuci District, Shanxi Province. The county immediately sent the director of the agricultural extension station to take charge of leading the masses to capture and eliminate them. The Yuci District Office has also instructed the county to use watering and hoeing methods to eliminate spider mites, and use diluted human manure and urine mixed with black alum and red alum to poison cutworms, and notify all counties under its jurisdiction to quickly inspect wheat fields, in order to achieve early detection and early eradication.

    平原河北山西部分地区发生虫害
    红蜘蛛猿叶虫为害最大
    各地正积极进行捕灭，个别县熟视无睹应纠正
    【本报讯】平原省从二月底到三月底，发生了虫害。种类即有猿叶虫、蝗虫、土蚕、地蛆、蛴螬、钢丝虫（叩头虫幼虫）、红蜘蛛、吃麦苗的白肉虫（牙虫科的一种幼虫）等十几种。为害最重的是油菜地里的猿叶虫。现在濮县、内黄、滑县、修武、延津等十余县的一百四十四个村里，发现的面积约三万余亩，一棵菜上有十个到一百个虫，已吃毁的菜苗有六千多亩。其他虫害有的已消灭，有的危害面积还正扩大。对于以上虫害，各地一般是注意捕灭。濮阳县发现害虫后，一面向上级报告，一面就组织群众进行大规模捕打。武陟县已成立除虫指挥部和捕虫大队，汲县、安阳也集中精力组织群众捕打。此外省府农业厅也先后派干部携带八十架喷雾器、一千一百斤地利斯，下乡协助捕灭，三天内即消灭严重虫害地四百余亩。但修武、延津等县只忙于结束土地改革工作，对当前虫害熟视无睹，以致虫害蔓延，该县领导上亟应立即紧急动员领导群众捕灭。  （雨滋）
    【本报讯】河北沧县专区、定县专区发生红蜘蛛等虫害。沧县专区交河、肃宁、任邱、建国等六县麦田，已先后发生红蜘蛛。定县专区的饶阳、安平、博野、曲阳、无极、新乐、源泽、安国九县不只发生红蜘蛛，还有绿蛆、蝗蝻二种。迄三月三十日止，沧县专区六县虫害已发展到二十个区、二百余村。火蜘蛛严重地区，麦苗已经发黄。肃宁、河间、献县三县交界地，有一千六百余亩麦田。每棵麦苗上有几十个红蜘蛛。定县专区以安平、博野两县为最重。现该两专署都发出紧急指示，号召各县立即发动群众力量，组织行政、技术干部，共同进行扑灭。现该区肃宁、献县、安平诸县，已派主要干部亲自领导扑灭虫害。献县、肃宁虫害已停止发展。但有些县份对虫害仍存有轻视思想，如建国、任邱、交河等县虫害发生后，有的仅派一位农场技术干部至虫害地区检查，有的甚至只下一通知，致使虫害蔓延。现该专署对此已指示纠正。

    【本报讯】三月下旬，山西省榆次专区介休县三区石河村一带麦田中，发见红蜘蛛、切根虫二种虫害，该县立即派农业推广场主任前往负责领导群众捕除。现榆次专署亦已指示该县用浇地锄地方法消灭红蜘蛛。用稀薄的人粪尿拌黑矾红矾毒杀切根虫。并通报所属各县迅速检查麦田，以期作到早期发现，早期扑灭。
