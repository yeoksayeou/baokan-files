    Henan Farmers' Anti-Hegemony Rent Reduction Movement Fully Launched
    Mu Jiajun
    The rural social reform movement in Henan Province has entered a climax of full-scale development. Since December of last year, the Henan farmers' movement has entered a period of full mobilization with the central tasks of opposing rural feudal hegemons (i.e., the power holders of the landlord class) and implementing rent reduction decrees. The movement has progressed extremely rapidly. As of the end of February this year, it has spread to 86 counties across the province. Currently, among the approximately 28 million rural people in the province (the total population of the province is approximately 30 million), areas with more than 22.8 million people have victoriously concluded the anti-hegemony and rent reduction campaign or are in the process of carrying it out. Among them, Jia County, Baofeng, Linru, and Lushan in Xuchang Prefecture, and Yichuan, Yiyang, and 13 other counties in Luoyang Prefecture are advanced areas in the Henan farmers' movement due to the earlier commencement of rural work. The farmers' movement in these 13 counties had already shifted from anti-hegemony rent reduction to the implementation of land distribution as early as last autumn. The land distribution in Jia County, Baofeng, and seven other counties was fully completed in late February and has transitioned into a large-scale production movement. In addition, key experimental work on land distribution has been carried out in all areas where the anti-hegemony rent reduction movement has been successfully concluded in various counties. These counties conducting key experiments, together with the aforementioned 13 counties that have fully implemented land distribution, totaled 38 counties by the end of February. In March, one-half of the rural areas in Henan Province successively concluded the anti-hegemony rent reduction movement and transitioned into the land distribution movement, striving to complete the historical task of land reform in one-half of the rural areas of the province before this year's wheat harvest.

    With the development of the farmers' movement, Henan farmers have been widely organized. According to incomplete statistics from December of last year, there were a total of 2.22 million male and female farmer association members in the province. In January of this year, the Henan Provincial Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee was also formally established to lead the province's farmers in their struggle against hegemony and rent reduction, thereby accelerating the movement's progress. Consequently, membership in the farmers' association has also greatly increased. According to statistics from Chenliu, Xuchang, Xinyang, Nanyang, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Huaiyang prefectures (Henan Province has a total of ten prefectures) in mid-January of this year, the number of farmer association members had increased by 710,000. As of the end of February, the number of farmer association members in the province had reached more than 3.59 million, becoming a powerful rural revolutionary force. From the beginning, Henan Province has paid attention to organizing the vast poor peasants and farm laborers in terms of farmer organizations, while also paying attention to uniting the middle peasants. Generally, middle peasants account for about one-third of the farmer association members in the province. The phenomenon of refusing middle peasants to participate, which occurred in some areas when organizing farmers, has been corrected after being discovered. In addition, during the movement, farmers disarmed bandits and hegemons to arm themselves. Across Henan Province, hundreds of thousands of militiamen organized by young farmers have been formed. At the end of last year, according to statistics from Luoyang, Xuchang, and five other prefectures alone, the militia reached more than 167,000. This powerful peasant armed force united the broad masses of peasants, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, has basically overthrown the rural regimes controlled by landlords and hegemons in more than 70 percent of the province, establishing a rural people's democratic dictatorship, laying a solid foundation for realizing "land to the tiller" in the province in 1950. The Provincial Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee convened a provincial farmers' representative conference in mid-March to formally establish the Henan Provincial Farmers' Association, in order to lead the province's farmers in the movement against hegemony and rent reduction, production for disaster relief, and land distribution.

    This widespread rural mass movement in Henan was launched in July and August of last year on the basis of the victory in suppressing bandits and the widespread rise of farmers to clear out bandits and oppose hegemons (i.e., to eliminate the remaining lurking bandits and oppose the landlord class power holders who colluded with the bandits). At that time, farmers saw the fact that bandits were being annihilated one after another, that bandit leaders were being captured one after another, that the People's Liberation Army was victorious throughout the country, and that work teams were going to the countryside to help them. Their revolutionary enthusiasm for wanting to turn the tables was high. Therefore, the movement to clear out bandits and oppose hegemons in rural areas deepened rapidly, becoming a movement of rural people (mainly farmers) against rural feudal rule and against landlord class power holders. After this movement in Henan was initiated in one township or one village as a key point, it developed wave-like to the surrounding villages, gradually extending to a district and a county, becoming a comprehensive movement. By September and October of last year, this movement had been carried out in the rural areas of more than 30 counties with a population of about 9 million. In areas where the movement was deep, such as Jia County, Linru, and Baofeng counties in Xuchang Prefecture, Yichuan and Yiyang counties in Luoyang Prefecture, Zheng County, Xingyang, and Chengfu counties in Zhengzhou Prefecture, and Chenliu County in Chenliu Prefecture, the advantage of the farmers has been basically established and the old rural regime has been transformed. In Henan's rural areas, the feudal forces of bandits and hegemons for many years have been basically crushed by the vigorous farmers' movement.

    Last year, some deviations occurred in the development of the farmers' movement. One of the reasons for these deviations was that the policy thinking of the cadres in the work teams leading the farmers in their struggle was unclear, and also because some cadres had an impatient attitude toward organizing the masses and launching struggles, and also had a careless and paternalistic style. When the farmers' movement had not yet started or had just started, they did not go or were not good at first relying on individual villages or townships as key points, and failed to gradually mobilize the broad masses of farmers ideologically, but only relied on a group of brave elements in the countryside (most of whom were vagrants) to arrest hegemons, convene conferences, and carry out struggles, and "launched" the farmers' movement in a large area all at once. This "bombing" deviation was called "big bombing and big fighting" in Henan. At that time, this deviation occurred in some areas. In this "big bombing and big fighting," the phenomena of arbitrarily arresting people, detaining people, and beating people indiscriminately in struggles inevitably occurred. In order to escape the just punishment of the farmers, the hegemonic elements also took the opportunity to use their lackey organizations to form fake farmer associations, carry out fake struggles, or create sectarian struggles to undermine the farmers' movement. Therefore, chaotic phenomena and deviations such as infringing on middle peasants and infringing on industry and commerce occurred in rural work at that time. These erroneous deviations were noticed, stopped, and corrected by the Henan farmers' movement leadership from the very beginning. After the Henan movement to clear out bandits and oppose hegemons deepened in August of last year, the province's proposed policy was "anti-hegemony liquidation," but it was not combined with rent reduction work. Therefore, although some areas actually carried out rent reduction after opposing hegemons in the actual movement, many areas consequently limited the movement to the issue of opposing hegemons, and the phenomenon of not opposing big hegemons but opposing small hegemons occurred. Some areas also infringed on some middle peasants with political blemishes. Also, because the leadership put forward the slogan of "liquidation," the farmers paid too much attention to the economic liquidation of hegemons in the struggle, which confused the steps of social reform.

    In order to quickly, comprehensively, and thoroughly correct the above-mentioned deviations, the Henan farmers' movement leadership temporarily ended the province's rural social reform work in October of last year, turning the focus of rural work at that time to the autumn harvest and autumn requisition. For about two months in October and November, mass work conferences of the nature of rectification and training for cadres of the farmers' movement were held from top to bottom from the province to the county. Through this conference, the policy level of the province's farmers' movement work cadres was generally improved, and they ideologically understood the specific policies of rural social reform and initially overcame the ideas of empiricism and agricultural socialism. At the same time, the conference also clearly put forward the steps and guidelines for combining anti-hegemony with rent reduction, mobilizing farmers, and preparing for land distribution. At this time, due to the rapid development of the national victory situation, due to the province having had more than two years of work foundation, due to Henan having eliminated bandit troubles, and more importantly, due to the good experience gained in the province's mass mobilization work for half a year, therefore, the anti-hegemony actions of 9 million farmers had created a large-scale rural revolutionary storm in the province. The farmers saw that the Communist Party and the People's Government were indeed helping the farmers to turn the tables, and that the hegemons could indeed be overthrown, so their courage and confidence in the struggle increased a hundredfold, and they urgently demanded to turn the tables. This period was the climax of the Henan farmers' movement.

    In the face of this high tide of the farmers' movement, although the Henan farmers' movement guidelines had been clearly formulated, and although the work cadres had a further understanding of the policy guidelines, many cadres generally had a phenomenon of being constrained in their work methods because they were afraid of violating policies; some cadres only carried out key work in isolation, and dared not universally mobilize the peasant masses; they did not organize and lead the spontaneous struggles of the peasants; and even individual cadres restricted the struggle actions of the peasant masses for fear of "making a mess." After discovering the above-mentioned deviations, the Henan farmers' movement leadership promptly corrected them, calling on cadres in various places to boldly mobilize the masses under the guidance of policies and leadership, and at the same time calling on cadres in various places to boldly use the county, district, and township farmers' representative meetings to tell the broad masses of farmers about the guidelines and policies, and turn them into the action program of the broad masses of farmers; in terms of work methods, it is necessary to combine key work and mobilize farmers in large areas through the farmers' representative meeting. Subsequently, the counties in Henan successively convened representative conferences of various circles in the county, announced the policy of anti-hegemony rent reduction, and made resolutions to mobilize farmers. Because most people understood the current farmers' movement policy, all the rumors and slanders of the hegemons, secret agents and other elements against the farmers' movement and the distortions of the policies were exposed, and all strata were able to feel at ease, thereby reducing the resistance to the farmers' movement. After the representative conferences of various circles in the county were held, Xuchang, Changge, Linying, Yanling, Suiping, Nanyang and other counties successively convened farmers' representative meetings in one district or one township to fully publicize the policies to the peasant masses, and then discovered a large number of activists through the farmers' representative meetings, and then organized the farmers' associations in large areas through these activists, and launched struggles in large areas. When widely trying out the farmers' representative meeting, Kaifeng and other places created a struggle form of reasoning and speaking.

    Because the work methods and struggle forms of the province's farmers' movement were initially correctly resolved, in January of this year, the Henan farmers' movement, with anti-hegemony rent reduction as the main trend, rapidly unfolded throughout the province. The counties in Nanyang, Xinyang, Shangqiu, Chenliu and other prefectures combined key experiments with the universal mobilization of the peasant masses, so that the farmers' movement quickly unfolded universally in the counties. For example, Nanyang County fully developed the farmers' movement in an area with a population of 400,000 in just one month.

    Because Henan Province has clearly stipulated the guidelines for anti-hegemony rent reduction, preparing for or implementing land distribution, cadres and peasant masses have a further understanding of the policies, and all social strata are relatively at ease; in addition, various places have adopted the work method of massively mobilizing the peasant masses through the farmers' representative meeting and the struggle form of reasoning, therefore, a new situation has emerged in the Henan farmers' movement. This new situation can be summarized as: step-by-step, with leadership, in an orderly manner, the movement has developed rapidly, the phenomenon of violating policies in the movement has been greatly reduced, and the phenomenon of cadres being constrained has also been overcome. Now the Henan province's farmers' movement is moving towards a climax. More than 50 of the 86 counties in the province are implementing land distribution, and a few advanced areas have completed land distribution and entered the large-scale production movement. Other counties are further developing the anti-hegemony rent reduction movement in depth.

　　河南农民反恶霸减租运动全面展开
    穆家军
    河南省农村社会改革运动刻已进入全面展开的高潮。自去年十二月以来，河南农民运动即进入以反对农村封建恶霸（即地主阶级当权派）和实行减租法令为中心任务的全面发动的时期。运动的进展极为迅速，截至今年二月底止，已遍及全省八十六个县，目前全省约二千八百万农村人口中（全省人口约为三千万），已有二千二百八十余万人口的地区胜利结束了反恶霸和减租或正在进行反恶霸和减租。其中，许昌专区的郏县、宝丰、临汝、鲁山等，洛阳专区伊川、伊阳等十三个县，由于农村工作开展较早，为河南省农民运动的先进地区。这十三个县的农民运动则早于去年秋后即已由反恶霸减租的运动转入了实行分配土地的运动。郏县、宝丰等七个县的分配土地在二月下旬且已全部完成，并转入大生产运动。此外，所有各县反恶霸减租运动已胜利结束的地区都又进行了分配土地的重点试验工作。这些进行重点试验的县连前述已全面实行分配土地的十三个县，在二月底已共达三十八个县。三月份中，河南全省农村有二分之一的地区先后结束反恶霸减租运动，而转入了分配土地的运动，以争取在今年麦收以前全省有二分之一的农村完成土地改革的历史任务。
    随着农民运动的开展，河南农民均广泛地组织起来。据去年十二月份不完全统计，全省男女农民协会会员共二百二十二万人。今年一月，河南省农民协会筹委会也正式成立了，领导全省农民进行反霸减租斗争，使运动进展迅速，因此，使农协会员也获得很大发展，今年一月中旬据陈留、许昌、信阳、南阳、郑州、洛阳和淮阳专区等七个专区（河南省共有十个专区）的统计，农协会员已增加了七十一万人。截至二月底，全省农协会员已达三百五十九万余人，成为一支强大有力的农村革命队伍。河南省在农民组织方面一开始就注意了组织广大贫农、雇农，同时也注意了团结中农。全省的农协会员中一般中农约占三分之一。部分地区在组织农民时所发生的拒绝中农参加的现象，经发现后已获得了纠正。此外，农民在运动中解除了土匪恶霸的武装来武装了自己。河南全省由青年农民组织起来的民兵已达数十万人。去年年底，仅据洛阳、许昌等五个专区的统计，民兵即达十六万七千余人。这支强大的农民武装团结了广大农民群众，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在全省百分之七十以上的地区，已基本上推翻了地主恶霸所掌握的乡村政权，建立了农村人民民主专政，为全省在一九五○年一年内实现耕者有其田打下了坚实的基础。现省农民协会筹委会已于三月中旬召开全省的农民代表大会，正式成立河南省农民协会，以领导全省农民反恶霸减租、生产渡荒和分配土地的运动。
    河南这一广泛的农村群众运动，是在去年七、八月间随着剿匪的胜利、农民普遍起来清匪反恶霸（即清除残余潜匪和反对与土匪勾结的地主阶级当权派）的基础之上开展起来的。当时农民看到股匪纷纷被歼、匪首纷纷落网的事实，看到解放军在全国胜利的事实，看到工作组下乡帮助他们，要求翻身的革命热情就高涨起来。因此农村清匪反霸的运动迅速深入，成为农村人民（主要是农民）反对乡村的封建统治、反对地主阶级当权派的运动。这个运动在河南开始由一个乡或一个村作重点发动起来后，即波浪式地向周围的乡村发展，逐渐推及于一个区、一个县，成为全面的运动。到去年九、十月间，就有三十多个县约九百万人口的农村开展了这个运动。凡运动深入的地区，如许昌专区的郏县、临汝、宝丰等县，洛阳专区的伊川、伊阳等县，郑州专区的郑县、荥阳、成阜等县，陈留专区的陈留等县，已基本上树立了农民的优势，改造了旧的乡村政权。河南农村中多年来土匪、恶霸封建势力已被轰轰烈烈的农民运动基本上冲垮了。
    去年，在农民运动开展中也曾发生过一些偏向。这些偏向产生的原因之一，是由于领导农民进行斗争的工作组的干部政策思想不明确，也由于部分干部对组织群众、发动斗争存在着急性病，而又有粗枝大叶，包办代替的作风。他们在农民运动未起或初起时，不去或不善于先依靠个别村、乡作重点，未能艰苦地从思想上逐步发动广大农民，而是仅仅依靠农村中的一批勇敢分子（大部分是游民），就逮捕恶霸，召集大会，进行斗争，一下子就在一大片地区把农民运动“轰”起来。这种“轰”的偏向，在河南称之为“大轰大?”。当时，在一些地区发生了这一偏向。在这种“大轰大?”中曾不可避免地发生了乱捕人、扣人和斗争中乱打人的现象。恶霸分子为逃避农民们正义的膺惩，也就乘机利用其狗腿组织假农会，进行假斗争，或制造宗派斗争，以破坏农民运动。因此，当时在农村工作中曾发生了混乱现象及侵犯中农、侵犯工商业等偏向。这些错误偏向，在一开始就为河南省农民运动领导方面所注意制止和纠正。去年八月河南清匪反霸的运动深入后，全省所提的方针是“反霸清算”，而未与减租工作相结合。因此，虽然实际运动中部分地区在反恶霸之后也进行了减租；但许多地区却因而将运动局限于反恶霸问题上，发生了没有大霸反小霸的现象。部分地区也因而侵犯了一部分在政治上有劣迹的中农。又因为领导方面提出“清算”的口号，农民在斗争中过多地注意了对恶霸的经济清算，以致混乱了社会改革的步骤。
    河南农民运动领导方面为迅速、全面而彻底地纠正上述偏向，即于去年十月间将全省农村社会改革工作暂予结束，将当时的农村工作中心转向秋收和秋征。以十月和十一月约两个月的时间，自上而下地从省到县分别召开了农民运动工作干部的整训性质的群众工作会议。经过这个会议，全省农民运动工作干部在政策水平上普遍提高了一步，从思想上了解了农村社会改革的各项具体政策，初步克服了经验主义和农业社会主义的思想。同时，会议上又明确地提出了反霸和减租结合、发动农民、准备分配土地的步骤和方针。这时由于全国胜利形势迅速发展，由于全省已有了两年多的工作基础，由于河南已肃清了匪患，更重要的是由于全省半年来发动群众工作已获得良好的经验，因此，九百万农民的反恶霸行动已在全省造成了一个大规模的农村革命风暴。农民看见共产党和人民政府确实帮助农民翻身，恶霸确实可以打倒，因而斗争的勇气和信心百倍增加，迫切要求翻身。这个时期是河南农民运动的高潮时期。
    在这种农民运动高潮形势前面，河南农民运动的方针虽然已经明确制定，工作干部对政策方针虽然也有了进一步的认识；但不少干部因为怕违反政策，在工作方法上却普遍地发生了束手束脚的现象；有些干部仅孤立地进行重点工作，而不敢普遍地发动农民群众；对于农民的自发斗争也不去加以组织和领导；甚至有个别干部因怕“搞乱了”而限制农民群众的斗争行动。河南农民运动领导方面发觉上述偏向后，即及时予以纠正，号召各地干部在有政策、有领导之下大胆放手发动群众，同时并号召各地干部大胆运用县、区、乡的农民代表会议，把方针、政策告诉广大农民群众，使之变成广大农民群众的行动纲领；在工作方法上，要结合重点工作，通过农民代表会发动大片地区的农民。接着，河南各县都纷纷召开了县各界代表会议，宣布了反霸减租的政策，并作出发动农民的决议。由于大多数人都了解了当前农民运动的政策，一切地主恶霸、特务分子对农民运动的造谣侮蔑和对政策的曲解均被戳穿，各阶层都能安心，因而减少了农民运动的阻力。在县各界代表会议开过后，许昌、长葛、临颖、鄢陵、遂平、南阳等县又先后召开一个区或一个乡的农民代表会，向农民群众充分宣传了政策，然后通过农民代表会发现了大批积极分子，再通过这些积极分子将大片地区的农民协会组织起来，发动大片地区的斗争。在广泛试用农民代表会时，开封等地又创造了说理说法的斗争形式。
    由于该省农民运动的工作方法和斗争形式初步获得正确解决，今年一月，河南以反霸减租为主潮的农民运动即在全省迅速展开。南阳、信阳、商邱、陈留等专区的各县都将重点试验与普遍发动农民群众结合进行，因此，使农民运动很快在各县普遍地展开起来。如南阳县仅在一个月的时间内，农民运动便在四十万人口的地区全面发展起来。
    由于河南省明确地规定了反恶霸减租、准备或实行分配土地的方针，干部和农民群众对政策有进一步了解，社会各阶层也比较安心；加之各地又采用通过农民代表会大规模发动农民群众的工作方法和说理说法的斗争形式，因此，河南的农民运动出现了一个新的局面。这个新局面总起来说就是：有步骤、有领导、有秩序，运动发展迅速，在运动中违犯政策的现象大大减少，干部中束手束脚的现象也被克服。现在河南全省农民运动正走向高潮，全省八十六个县，有五十余县正实行分配土地，其中少数先进地区则已完成分配土地而进入大生产运动。其他各县则正进一步深入展开反恶霸减租运动。
