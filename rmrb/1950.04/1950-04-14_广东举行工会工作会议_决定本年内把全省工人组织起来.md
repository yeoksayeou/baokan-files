Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 11th: The Guangdong Provincial Trade Union Work Conference was held from the 20th of last month to the 7th of this month. The conference summarized the development of trade union work in various parts of Guangdong Province and put forward work tasks for the next eight months. In the five months since the liberation of Guangdong Province, although trade union preparatory committees have been established in most counties and cities, organizational work has not been widely carried out. Some trade union cadres in some counties and cities do not have a clear understanding of the mass nature of trade unions, resulting in many harsh conditions for joining. For example, workers applying for membership must first have their family background investigated or their past history reviewed before a decision is made whether or not to accept them. Workers who participated in the Kuomintang or the Three People's Principles Youth League in the past are not allowed to join the trade union, or they must take an oath before being allowed to join. However, other counties and cities have the tendency to indiscriminately recruit members. For example, some trade unions find the roster of the former puppet trade union, and workers whose names are on it can become trade union members simply by re-registering. Some places even preserve the very reactionary machine trade union of the past intact and allow it to continue its activities. In response to the above deviations and current work tasks, and based on the principle of combining trade union work with production, the conference put forward four specific requirements for future work: (1) To basically organize all workers in the province by the end of this year, and strive to hold worker representative conferences in various counties and cities and throughout the province around the "August 1st" holiday. (2) Actively support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea to fight. (3) Focusing on the restoration of production, cooperate with the administrative side in organizing factory management committees in state-owned factories; carry out the organization of labor-management consultation meetings and the signing of collective contracts in private enterprises; and carry out worker welfare undertakings in the process of restoring and developing production. (4) Establish a system for lower-level trade unions to report to higher-level trade unions every month.

　　广东举行工会工作会议
    决定本年内把全省工人组织起来
    【新华社广州十一日电】广东省工会工作会议于上月二十日至本月七日举行。会议总结了广东省各地工会工作的发展情况，并提出今后八个月的工作任务。广东省解放五个月来，大部县市虽已成立工会筹备会，但组织工作并未普遍展开。有些县市的工会干部对工会的群众性的基本认识不够明确，致订出许多苛刻的入会条件。如对请求入会的工人，首先要调查其家庭成份，或审查其过去历史，然后决定吸收与否；过去参加国民党、三青团的工人、均不加区别地一律不许参加工会，或要经过宣誓以后才准参加。但另外有些县市却又有滥收会员的偏向。如有的工会把过去伪工会的名册找来，有名字的工人，只要重新登记即可成为工会会员。有的地方甚至把过去很反动的机器工会原封不动地保存下来，准许其继续活动。此次会议针对以上偏向和目前的工作任务，以及根据工会结合生产进行工作的方针，提出今后工作的四项具体要求：（一）在今年年底把全省工人基本上组织起来，争取在“八一”节前后普遍召开各县市和全省工人代表会议。（二）积极支援人民解放军渡海作战。（三）以恢复生产为中心，在公营工厂中配合行政方面组织工厂管理委员会；在私营企业中进行组织劳资协商会议和签订集体合同工作；并在恢复与发展生产的过程中举办工人福利事业。（四）建立每个月下级工会对上级工会的报告制度。
