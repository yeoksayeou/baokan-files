　　Improving Agricultural Techniques to Guarantee Increased Production
    The Communist Party Branch of Dazhai Village, Yushe County, Leads the Masses
    Plan to Improve More Than 500 Mu of Soil
    Estimating a Minimum Increase of 87 Shi of Coarse Grain
    [This Newspaper, Taiyuan News] The Communist Party Branch of Dazhai Administrative Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, based on the experience of veteran farmers and the increased production achievements of last year, organized and led the masses to carry out soil adjustment and geological improvement work, which provided an important guarantee for the realization of increased production tasks. This is an important step for the village's farmers, on the basis of being organized, to further utilize the experience of veteran farmers to improve agricultural techniques. Last year, the Dazhai Administrative Village Branch led the farmers to plant more than 5,600 poplar and willow trees along the riverbank, connecting with the original number to form a protective line to stabilize the river channel. It also dug six drainage ditches, exempting 240 mu of waterlogged land from flooding and increasing the production of coarse grains by 72 shi (13 jin per dou, same below).
    After the county party congress arranged for this year's agricultural production this spring, the village branch, in formulating the annual plan and mobilizing spring plowing production, hired experienced veteran farmers for guidance and studied the village's production situation this year and the increased production experience of last year. It unanimously agreed that adjusting the soil and improving the geology is one of the important guarantees for the village to realize this year's increased production plan. Last year, farmer Zhang Huaiyuan in this village added 150 dan of sandy soil per mu to the red clay (sticky soil) land on the river滩 after drainage, resulting in a 30% increase in grain production compared to previous years. Zhang Bucheng filled his three mu of sandy land with 600 dan of "糟 soil" ("zao tu" white soil), and after the autumn harvest, he harvested a total of 7 shi and 5 dou of millet (previously only 3 shi). Zhang Sanxiao lined one mu of滩 land with 200 dan of sand, yielding 5 dou more of millet than in previous years. Therefore, the entire administrative village has determined to adjust 540 mu of soil this year, with a minimum estimated increase of 87 shi of coarse grains.
    In the past, although veteran farmers had rich experience in increasing production, no one was willing to pass it on to others in the old society. After land reform and two years of production movements, farmers deeply felt the benefits of organized mutual aid labor and became very interested in exchanging agricultural techniques to increase output. However, these technical experiences have not yet been analyzed and researched to make them scientific, and the vast majority of farmers have not yet accepted them. For example, some farmers believe that "adjusting the soil is a waste of effort" and fear that it will damage the crops. After the branch convened a forum for veteran technicians to explain the reasons why soil adjustment can increase production, such as the red clay soil on the river滩, which is cold and dense, its advantage is that it is easy to store water, and its disadvantage is that it is not easy to absorb sunlight and air. Sandy soil is hot and loose, easy to absorb sunlight and air, but not easy to retain water. To make crops grow well and produce more grain, there must be sufficient sunlight, air, and water. After explaining this scientific principle to the farmers and combining it with the introduction of examples of increased production last year, it was particularly emphasized to seize the season and strengthen the leadership of mutual aid in labor so as to complete the work of improving the soil on the river灘 land before the river rises. Currently, under the leadership of Zhang Changfu, the secretary of the Dazhai Administrative Village Branch, labor hero Zhang Zhiqian, and active elements, more than 18,000 dan of soil have been moved in the past ten days, improving 100 mu of soil. Under their influence, the nearby administrative villages of Baicun, Shanhun, Qingyu, and Shuimotou have also begun to carry out soil improvement.
    In order to promote this movement, the Communist Party Committee of Yushe County convened 75 branch secretaries, labor heroes, and activists from nine surrounding administrative villages (a total of 24 natural villages) with soil improvement conditions in Dazhai Village on March 20 to discuss the technical experience and leadership issues of soil improvement. In addition to the visit on the same day, the veteran technicians of the Dazhai branch introduced the village's promotion and leadership experience, extensively exchanged views on technical issues, and put forward the next stage of work. Dazhai Administrative Village alone is expected to complete 80% of this year's plan to adjust 540 mu of soil before sowing.

　　提高农业技术保证增产
    榆社大寨村中共支部带领群众
    计划改良土壤五百余亩
    估计最低可增产粗粮八十七石
    【本报太原讯】山西榆社县大寨行政村中共支部，根据老农的经验及去年增产成绩，组织与领导群众进行调剂土壤、改良地质工作使增产任务的实现获得了重要保证。这是该村农民在组织起来的基础上，进一步发挥老农经验提高农业技术的一个重要步骤。大寨行政村支部去年领导农民沿河畔栽植了杨柳树五千六百余株，与河滩原有数目衔接构成防护线，以固定河槽，另开退水渠六道，使二百四十亩水浸地免除水患，增产粗粮七十二石（每斗十三斤，下同）。
    今春县党代会布置今年农业生产后，该村支部在制订全年计划和动员春耕生产中，聘请技术老农指导，研究本村今年生产情况和去年增产经验，一致认为调剂土壤、改良地质，是该村实现今年增产计划的重要保证之一。去年该村农民张怀元，在排水后的河滩红胶泥（粘土）地里，一亩加沙土一百五十担，结果比往年增产粮百分之三十；张补成的三亩沙土地，填了六百担“糟土”（白土），秋后共收谷子七石五斗（过去只收三石），张三小一亩滩地垫沙二百担，比往年多收五斗谷。因此，全行政村今年确定调剂土壤五百四十亩，最低可增产粗粮八十七石。
    过去，老农虽有丰富的增产经验，但在旧社会谁也不愿意传授别人，经过土地改革和二年来的生产运动，农民深深感到了组织起来互助劳动的好处，对交流农业技术增加产量感到了很大兴趣。但这些技术经验还没有加以分析研究使之科学化，广大农民还未接受。如有些农民认为“调剂土壤是白费工夫”，恐怕把庄稼弄坏。经过此次支部召集技术老农座谈，说明调剂土壤能够增产的原因，如河滩红胶泥地，土质阴寒紧密，长处是易于储蓄水分，缺点是不易吸收阳光和空气；沙土性热疏松，容易吸收阳光和空气，而不易保存水分。要使庄稼长得好、多打粮食，就必须有充分的阳光、空气和水分。经过向农民讲明这种科学道理，并结合介绍去年增产的实例后，又特别强调了抓紧季节，并加强劳动互助的领导，以便在河水未涨前完成河滩地的改良土壤工作，现大寨行政村在支书张昌福、劳动英雄张志全和积极分子的带头下，十多天来人担车拉，已移土一万八千余担，改良土壤一百亩。在他们影响下，附近的白村、山荤、青峪、水磨头等行政村亦开始进行土壤改良。
    为了推广这一运动，中共榆社县委会于三月二十日在大寨村，召集了周围有改良土壤条件的九个行政村（共二十四个自然村）支书、劳动英雄和积极分子七十五人，座谈了改良土壤的技术经验及领导问题。除当日参观外，由大寨支部技术老农介绍了该村推广的情况及领导经验，在技术问题上广泛交换了意见，并提出了下一段的工作，仅大寨行政村在播种前即要完成今年调剂土壤五百四十亩计划的百分之八十。
