Spring Talk on Southern Sichuan
	Li Yongzhen

	In the vast fields of southern Sichuan, everything is already a lush green: the verdant wheat grows so vigorously, the golden rapeseed flowers exude a delicate fragrance, the continuous rain has ended, and the bright red sun shines all day long. In the warm sunshine, people can barely stand to wear their thin cotton jackets. Because the entire terrain of the Sichuan Basin slopes southward, and the mountains in the north shield it from the cold winds blowing from the north, the climate here is indeed different: the weather in the late first month is almost comparable to the flourishing Jiangnan region in March.

	Southern Sichuan is a good place
	Salt below, sugar above.

	This is undeniable: the resource-rich Southwest is the industrial construction base of New China. Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance," and its prosperity surpasses the provinces of Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Southern Sichuan is the most densely populated and resource-rich area of Sichuan. Therefore, its wealth and importance can be imagined. As the saying goes, "sweet above, salty below," Zigong (Ziliujing and Gongjing) is rich in edible salt, with more than 4,000 large and small salt wells, producing more than 600 million catties of well salt annually; Neijiang and Zizhong produce sugarcane sugar (in many counties in southern Sichuan, besides rice and wheat, the main crop is sugarcane); Longchang produces ramie cloth and pig bristles; Leshan produces silk, white wax, and Jiale paper; Emei produces medicinal herbs, etc., too numerous to mention. When you first arrive in southern Sichuan, looking around, whether it is a high mountain or a plain, the fields are full of crops, a scene of abundance. It is difficult to find half an acre of wasteland. Even the ridges of the fields are planted with broad beans, peas, and the like. The terraced fields from the foot of the mountain to the top, one level after another, are even more beautiful. All of this forms a picture of diligence, thrift, and hard work by the vast number of farmers in southern Sichuan.

	However, in proportion to its wealth, the feudal forces in southern Sichuan were also quite strong. For many years, the people of southern Sichuan suffered from the devastation of evil forces and the oppression of the Kuomintang bandit gang's reactionary rule. They endured the pain of being exploited and persecuted, and their expectations for liberation were extremely urgent!

	The winter of 1949, a day that the people of Sichuan, especially the people of southern Sichuan, will never forget, finally arrived. Following the liberation of eastern Sichuan and Chongqing, the people of southern Sichuan were completely liberated in mid-December. They greeted their own troops with unparalleled joy, and under the victorious five-star national flag, began a new life of freedom. From then on, southern Sichuan belonged to the people forever, and the people were forever the masters of southern Sichuan!

	After liberation, the people of southern Sichuan had their own political power – the Southern Sichuan Administrative Office (in Luxian), which governs one city – Zigong City, four special districts, and thirty-four counties. The staff in these places, in addition to veteran cadres, consisted of students from the Military and Political University and the Southwest Service Corps who had traveled seven thousand li from Ninghu, as well as a large number of progressive youths from southern Sichuan who had newly joined the revolution. They were widely distributed in every city and village in southern Sichuan, serving the vast number of people in southern Sichuan with sincerity and hard work.

	To build a new Southern Sichuan
	Everyone actively pays public grain

	Southern Sichuan, which had been subjected to the Kuomintang's frantic plunder, was left with not wealth but a dilapidated mess after liberation. Nearly 300,000 old personnel and old armed forces needed to be supported and reformed; and it was also necessary to devote considerable strength to support the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet. However, the 12 million people of southern Sichuan did not bow to these difficulties. On the contrary, everyone is working together, uniting as one, to assist their government and army in fighting to overcome the current difficulties!

	First of all, the central task of grain requisition (the total task in the Southern Sichuan area is 1 billion catties) is being completed with the utmost effort by the vast majority of people in Southern Sichuan. Everyone deeply knows: This is to support the front lines, ensure supplies, continue to liberate Tibet, heal the wounds after the Kuomintang bandits' destruction, and carry out the necessary construction of the New China in front of us. They recognized that the People's Government is their own government, and that the requisition of grain is still doing things for the common people themselves, which is completely different from the Kuomintang reactionaries' plundering and fattening their own pockets; in addition, the burden policy is fair and reasonable: "More grain is given by those who have more grain, and less grain is given by those who have less grain," so the payment of grain is exceptionally enthusiastic. For example, the Neijiang Special District, as of February 13, had collected more than 4.2 million catties of rice, more than 1.03 million catties of white sugar, and more than 1.18 million catties of paddy rice. Many large grain households are also rushing to pay grain. The broad masses of farmers in Zigong City have launched a competition, setting off a high tide of grain payment, and the streets are filled with lines of people delivering public grain every day. Women in the Fourth Bao of the Ninth District of the city quickly paid their public grain, and also participated in the urging of grain payment. Together with the comrades of the work team, they performed the Yangko dance to persuade the landlords that it is better to pay early than late. In addition, some of the old rural Bao personnel also showed a positive and responsible attitude towards the grain requisition work, and were praised by the masses and superiors.

	In order to prepare for spring plowing and production, and to take care of the people's actual difficulties, the Southern Sichuan Administrative Office issued a notice on February 23 that public grain can be collected in two phases, before and after the minor spring harvest, and improved the grain requisition methods to reduce the burden on people of all strata. For example, in areas lacking rice, cash, sugar, cotton, and other materials can be collected as appropriate. In this way, the people of southern Sichuan are even more saying: "After all, it is the People's Government that is thinking of the people in every way!"

	Factories and mines are gradually recovering
	Gongs and drums celebrate the Spring Festival

	Under the correct leadership and strong support of the People's Government, the public and private production undertakings in southern Sichuan have partially recovered, and the economy has largely recovered. Look: 300,000 dan of edible salt has been shipped out of Zigong in January, and the current monthly output is 170,000 dan, reaching 40% of the highest output in 1938. The Leshan Salt Field was forced to stop production and reduce production by more than 70% before liberation due to the depreciation of counterfeit currency and the looting of bandit troops, and now most of them have resumed work. On January 27, the salt production was 801 dan, with 329 cooking pots, accounting for two-thirds of the field's highest output (monthly output of 32,000 dan). The remaining few that have not resumed salt production are all starting work in early February. On December 21 last year, the Jianwei Salt Field had 263 cooking pots in operation, with an output of 625 dan. By January 10 this year, the number of pots had increased to 427, and the output had increased to 1,139 dan. As a result, the 300 salt workers who lost their jobs in the factory and the Leshan Salt Field before liberation have now returned to work. After the Yibin State-owned China Paper Factory resumed work on January 7, it immediately launched a "three people's work done by two people" campaign of day and night production, and the daily paper production has increased from the initial 200 reams to 300 reams per day. The Jiale Paper Factory, which had been suspended for eight months, also resumed work on February 5. Due to the orders from various newspaper offices and the Chengdu Military Control Commission, the daily output of 75 reams has fallen short of demand. Since February 23, it has been fully operational and the daily output has increased to 110 reams. In addition, the private Jiayang Coal Mine in Jianwei has seen orders from trade companies, power plants, and the Chongqing Industrial Department due to the People's Government's strict protection of the navigation of the Minjiang River and the Yangtze River, solving the problems of funds and sales, and the monthly output has increased from less than 3,000 tons before liberation to more than 5,000 tons. The private Jinchuan Alcohol Factory in Luxian also resumed work on February 20 overcoming difficulties, and the current daily output is 750 gallons.

	This year's Spring Festival is the first Spring Festival for the people of Southern Sichuan after liberation, and everyone celebrated it with unparalleled joy. The work teams in various districts of Luxian used slogans, blackboards, wall poems, cartoons, songs, local language speeches, and costume performances to carry out publicity among the masses on current affairs, grain requisition policies, suppression of bandits and anti-special, and spring plowing and production, and twisted the Yangko dance to pay New Year's greetings to the farmers. The Fushun work team held a gala with the masses, performing operas such as "The Army and the People are One Family," "Paying Public Grain," and "Sending Eggs," and organized youth students to study and conducted individual visits. Neijiang held a 10,000-person celebration meeting, and everyone paraded through the streets holding high the national flag and huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with gongs and drums beating and cheers shaking the ground. The Yangko teams of various agencies in Zigong performed street plays such as "Attack Taiwan," the workers danced dragon lanterns and lion lanterns, the students performed "The White-Haired Girl," the Women's Federation comforted the hospitalized wounded and sick soldiers of the People's Liberation Army; the Eighth District People's Government and the garrison organized a Spring Festival comfort team to comfort the families of revolutionary soldiers in the local area, gave glorious lanterns and held a gala; the farmers in the First District also comforted the People's Liberation Army.

	What excited the people of southern Sichuan as much as celebrating the Spring Festival was the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in Moscow on February 14. Everyone unanimously and sincerely supported and warmly cheered the signing of this treaty, expressing unlimited gratitude for the great friendship of the Soviet Union. On February 19, the Administrative Office invited representatives from all walks of life in Luxian to hold a grand symposium celebrating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and actively prepared for the establishment of the Luxian Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Other places such as Neijiang also held celebrations one after another, and Zigong City held a large-scale parade of 20,000 people on March 3.

	Everyone loves the new culture
	Farmers start spring plowing

	Following the arrival of the New Year, cultural and educational activities in various parts of southern Sichuan have also been widely launched. Student union organizations at the county level have been established one after another. On March 15, a symposium of student representatives from the southern Sichuan area was held in Luxian; teachers in the Luzhou Special District organized training classes and held picture exhibitions; the Cultural and Art Troupe of the Political Department of the Southern Sichuan Military Region performed the famous historical dramas "Li Chuangwang" and "Wang Xiuluan" and "Liu Hulan"; the preparatory committees of the local Democratic Women's Federations warmly celebrated the first "March 8" International Women's Day after liberation... In addition, after the Xinhua Bookstore Southern Sichuan Branch opened in Luxian on February 22, everyone was extremely excited. The front store sold more than 2,000 books on the first day, and until 5 pm when the business hours were over, there were still many people crowded in front of the door. It can be seen from this how much the people of southern Sichuan love the new culture!

	Spring has arrived, and the vast fields of southern Sichuan are already a lush green. "A year's plan starts in spring." The people of southern Sichuan have not forgotten this ancient teaching, especially since this year's spring already belongs to them! The farmers of southern Sichuan have started spring plowing: repairing fields, tilling the soil, selecting seeds, and making fertilizer. They firmly believe that from this effort and drop of sweat, they will exchange for the early arrival of a good day!

　　新春话川南
    李永震
    在广大的川南原野上，已经是绿油油的一片：碧绿的麦子长得这么茁壮，金黄的油菜花吐出了清香，连绵的阴雨结束了，整日照耀着鲜红的太阳，在和煦的阳光下，人们薄棉袄已经有些穿不住了。由于四川盆地整个地势的倾斜向南，北边的山地可以屏蔽北方吹来的冷风，这儿的气候确实不同：正月下旬的天气，几乎抵得上草长莺飞的江南三月。
    川南本是好地方  下有盐巴上有糖
    这是谁都不能否认的事：蕴藏丰富的大西南是新中国的工业建设基地，四川被称为“天府之国”，在西南说来，其富庶是驾乎康、滇、黔三省之上的。而川南又是四川人口最密、资源最富的地方。那末，他的富裕和重要性也就可想而知了。所谓“上面甜、下面咸”，自贡（自流井和贡井）盛产食盐，大小盐井四千多口，每年能产井盐六亿余斤；内江、资中的蔗糖（川南许多县份，除种稻、麦外，主要的农作物就是种植甘蔗）；隆昌的夏布，猪鬃；乐山的蚕丝、白腊和嘉乐纸；峨嵋的药材等等，多得不胜枚举。当你初到川南，举目四望，不问高山或平地，田禾满布，一片油然，不易找出半亩荒田空地，就连田埂上也还要种点蚕豆豌豆之类。从山脚到山顶一级接一级的梯田，更是好看。这一切，汇成了广大的川南农民一幅克勤克俭、辛勤生产的图画。
    可是，和富裕成正比例的，却是川南的封建势力，更是相当的大。多少年来，川南人民在恶势力的摧残下，在国民党匪帮反动统治的压迫下，受尽了被压榨、迫害的痛苦，因之，期待翻身解放，极为迫切！
    一九四九年的冬天，这个四川人民尤其是川南人民永远难忘的日子终于到来了。继川东、重庆解放以后，川南人民在十二月中旬全部获得了解放。他们用无比的欢欣迎接着自己的队伍，在胜利的五星国旗下，开始新的自由生活。从此，川南永远属于人民，人民永远是川南的主人翁了！
    解放后，川南人民有了自己的政权机构——川南行政公署（在泸县）辖一个市——自贡市，四个专区，三十四个县。这些地方的工作人员中除老干部外，就是经过七千里跋涉从宁沪来的军政大学和西南服务团的学员，以及大批新参加革命的川南进步青年，他们广泛地分布在川南的每一个城市和乡村，热诚而艰苦地在为广大的川南人民服务。
    为了建设新川南  大家踊跃缴公粮
    饱经蒋匪疯狂掠夺的川南，解放后，留下来的不是财富而是个破烂的摊子。将近三十万的旧人员、旧武装，需要养活和改造；并且还必须拿出相当力量支援解放军向西藏的进军。然而，川南一千二百万人民，并没有向这困难低头，相反地，大家正协力同心，团结一致，协助自己的政府和军队，在为战胜当前的困难而斗争！
    首先，就是作为中心工作的征粮工作（川南区的总任务是十亿斤），绝大多数的川南人民都为这个任务的完成而竭尽全力。每个人都深深知道：这是为了支援前线，保证供给，去继续解放西藏，和医好蒋匪破坏后的创伤，并进行新中国眼前必需的建设。他们认识了人民政府是自己的政府，征粮还是替老百姓自己做事，与过去国民党反动派的搜括掠夺、饱肥私囊完全不同；加之负担政策的公平合理：“粮多多出，粮少少出”，所以，缴粮异常踊跃。如内江专区截至二月十三日止，已征收大米四百二十余万斤，白糖一百○三万余斤，稻谷一百一十八万余斤。许多大粮户也都争先缴粮。自贡市广大农民群众更展开竞赛，掀起了缴粮热潮，大街上天天拥着送公粮的行列。该市九区四保的妇女一面很快地缴纳了自己的公粮，一面参加催粮工作，和工作队同志们一同扭秧歌，劝地主晚缴不如早缴。此外，旧乡保人员中有的对征粮工作也表现了积极负责态度，受到了群众和上级的表扬。
    为了准备春耕生产，照顾人民实际困难，从二月二十三日起，川南行署通令公粮可分小春前后两期征收，并改进了征粮办法，减轻了各阶层人民的负担，如缺米地区可酌收现金、糖、棉等物资。这样，川南人民更是争说：“到底是人民政府，处处替人民设想！”
    工厂矿山渐恢复  锣鼓喧天庆春节
    在人民政府的正确领导和大力扶植下，川南公私营生产事业已部分获得了恢复，经济已大体复苏。看吧：自贡的食盐，一月份已运出三十万担，目前每月能产十七万担，已达一九三八年最高产量百分之四十。乐山盐场在解放前因伪币贬值和匪军抢掠，盐价剧跌，被迫停煎减产的达百分之七十以上，而现在都已大部复工，一月二十七日的产盐是八○一担，煎锅三二九口，占全场最高产额（月产三二、○○○担）三分之二强。其余少数未恢复产盐的，也都在二月上旬全部开工。犍为盐场去年十二月二十一日开煎锅口是二百六十三口，产量六百二十五担，到今年一月十日锅口已增到四百二十七口，产量一千一百三十九担。因之，解放前该厂与乐山盐场失业的三百盐工现已复业。宜宾国营中国纸厂于一月七日复工后，即展开“三个人的事两个人做”昼夜开工的突击生产运动，现每日产纸已由最初的二百令增为日产三百令。停工已八月之久的嘉乐纸厂，也于二月五日复工，由于各报社及成都军管会纷纷订货，日产七十五令的产量已供不应求，自二月二十三日起，已全部开工生产，日产增为一百一十令。还有犍为的私营嘉阳煤矿，因人民政府严加保护泯江和长江的航运，贸易公司、电厂及重庆工业部等纷纷订货，解决了资金和销路问题，现已由解放前的月产不足三千吨增至五千多吨。泸县私营金川酒精厂也于二月二十日在克服困难中复工，目前日产量七百五十加仑。
    今年的春节是川南人民解放后的第一个春节，大家以无比的愉快心情来热烈庆祝。泸县各区工作队在农村里以标语、黑板报、墙头诗、漫画、歌唱、土语讲演及化装表演等形式，向群众进行时事及征粮政策、剿匪反特、春耕生产的宣传，并扭着秧歌去向农民拜年。富顺工作队与群众开联欢大会，表演《军民一家》、《缴公粮》、《送鸡蛋》等歌剧，并组织了青年学生学习，进行了个别访问。内江举行了万人庆祝大会，大家高举着国旗和毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像满街游行，锣鼓喧天，欢声震地。自贡各机关的秧歌队表演了《打到台湾去》等街头剧，工人们舞龙灯和狮灯，学生们演了《白毛女》，妇联慰问解放军的住院伤病员；八区人民政府和驻军组织春节慰劳队，向当地革命军人家属进行慰问，赠送光荣彩灯和开联欢会；一区农民也向解放军进行了慰问。
    与过春节同样使川南人民兴奋的，就是二月十四日在莫斯科的中苏缔约，大家对这个条约的签订一致竭诚的拥护和热烈地欢呼。对苏联的伟大友谊，表示无限的感激。二月十九日，行署邀请泸县各界代表，举行了庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约的盛大座谈会，并积极筹组中苏友协泸县分会。其他如内江等地也先后开了庆祝会，自贡市在三月三日举行了两万人的大游行。
    人人热爱新文化  农民着手动春耕
    紧跟着新春的来到，川南各地的文教活动也普遍展开。以县为单位的学联组织纷纷成立，三月十五日在泸县召开了川南区学生代表座谈会；泸州专区教师组织了讲习班，并举行了图画展览；川南军区政治部文工团上演了历史名剧《李闯王》和《王秀鸾》、《刘胡兰》等剧；各地民主妇联筹备会，热烈地庆祝解放后第一个“三八”国际妇女节……。此外，新华书店川南分店二月二十二日在泸县开业后，大家都异常兴奋，门市部头一天就售出书籍两千多册，直到下午五时营业时间已过，门前还挤满很多人，川南人民的如何热爱新文化，由此可见一斑！
    春天到了，广大的川南原野上，已经绿油油的一片，“一年之计在于春”，川南人民没有忘记这句古训，何况今年的春天已经是属于自己的呢！川南农民已经着手春耕：修田、翻土、选种、制肥。他们深信：从这一把力一滴汗里，会换取好日子的早日到来！
