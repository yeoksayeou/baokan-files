　　Yellow River Spring Repair Project Fully Underway
    Yellow River Commission Instructs Certain County Sections to Correct Purely Relief-Oriented Viewpoints
    [This newspaper reports] The Yellow River spring repair project has been fully launched. After the Yellow River management meeting in January, all Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureaus seized the opportunity to quickly deploy the Yellow River management tasks, striving to start work on schedule or ahead of schedule. The embankment restoration work in Pingyuan and Shandong began successively around March 5th, with more than 100,000 laborers and some troops enthusiastically going to the embankments. Under unified leadership, adhering to the principles of "combining engineering with disaster relief, disaster relief serving engineering" and "paying according to the quantity, more work more pay," considerable achievements have been made. In the Shou Zhang and Pu County sections of Pingyuan, each person generally averages more than three cubic meters of earthwork per day, while in Taiqian and Gao Zhang villages, the average reaches five cubic meters. In Huimin, Shandong, ten days of work were completed in seven days. In Bin County, many laborers earn wages of eight to ten jin of rice per day. In Gaoqing, three rounds of ramming are done, turning four-cun billet heads into two and a half to two and eight-tenths cun. In Lanfeng, Henan, the most stone transported per cart is 1,200 jin, earning more than 20 jin of rice. One person's wage income can solve the livelihood problems of seven or eight people. With food and income, the laborers not only maintain high morale but also greatly improve the quality and efficiency of the project. The first phase of the project in various places is about to end, and the second phase will continue to begin. However, due to insufficient preparation before the start of construction and the bureaucratic and purely relief-oriented viewpoints of the leaders in some county sections, the work still has shortcomings that urgently need to be overcome. In some county sections of Pingyuan and Shandong, where the disaster situation is more severe, cadres believe that "disaster victims will have food to eat as soon as they go to the embankment," so they rush everyone, regardless of age or weakness, to the embankment. After thousands of disaster victims went to the embankment in Liangshan, they could not receive grain and could not work. In individual villages in Juancheng, pre-borrowed grain exceeded 100%. However, because the embankment had water, they could not work. As a result, some did very little work, and the wages they earned were not enough to eat; at the same time, the project was greatly affected, and manpower and resources were wasted. Although these errors have been pointed out and inspected by the leadership, some county sections have not completely corrected them.
    In order to correct these shortcomings, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission issued instructions to strengthen the spring construction work, pointing out: 1. Strengthen engineering organization and leadership. Experience has proven that without relying on mobilizing the masses, any administrative orders or bureaucratic approaches will fail in embankment restoration projects. It is essential to establish unified embankment restoration headquarters at all levels. However, thorough preparations must be made to avoid rashly starting construction. Timely inspections must be carried out to ensure the smooth development of the spring construction work. Various localities can use small newspapers and broadcasts to share experiences and lessons learned, and pay attention to the ideological leadership of cadres. 2. Combine spring construction with production and disaster relief. In this year's spring construction, using work as a form of relief and combining it with disaster relief is our political task; however, it must be combined with engineering standards in the process. We should utilize the labor of the disaster victims to complete the spring construction task well. Helping the disaster victims to overcome the famine through spring construction is also essential. Any neglect of engineering and purely focusing on relief, or only caring about engineering and not caring about disaster relief, is harmful. 3. Master the quality and efficiency of the project. This is the central link in completing the engineering standards. This year, with water in the embankment river and long distances for soil extraction, it is necessary to strengthen organizational education in embankment restoration, implement contract work, unify the leadership of earthwork and ramming work, carry out competitions to establish merit, and ensure improved project quality and efficiency. 4. Practice thrift. This year's spring construction is being carried out under the national economic difficulties. Therefore, the expenditure and use of human, material, and financial resources must be correct and reasonable, and any waste must be opposed. Local regulations that have unreasonable unit prices for work should be corrected to ensure that neither the state nor the laborers suffer losses. The instructions finally pointed out: All localities should seize the leadership of spring construction, organize forces to conduct in-depth inspections, grasp the principles, correct deviations; at the same time, they should actively consult and contact governments at all levels, cooperate with each other, and ensure the victorious completion of the task.

　　黄河春修工程全面展开
    黄委会指示某些县段纠正单纯救济观点
    【本报讯】黄河春修工程已全面展开。各黄河水利局在一月治黄会议后，均抓紧时机，迅速将治黄任务布置下去，争取了如期或提前开工。平原、山东复堤工作，已于三月五日前后即相继开工，十余万民工与一部分军队踊跃上堤。在统一领导下，以“工程结合救灾，救灾服从工程”，“按方给资，多做多得”的原则，已获不少成绩。平原的寿张、濮县等县段每人每日大都平均作三方土以上，台前、高张等村则平均达五方土。山东惠民十天任务七天完成。滨县有不少民工每日得工资米八斤到十斤。高青做到打套硪三遍，把四公寸的坯头，打成二·五至二·八公寸。河南兰封等处的运石，最多的每车推一千二百斤，得米二十余斤。一个人的工资所得可解决七、八个人的生活问题。民工有吃有得，不但情绪保持旺盛，且大大的提高了工程的质量和效率。现各地第一期工程行将结束，第二期将继续开始。但由于动工前准备工作不够，某些县段领导的官僚主义与单纯救济观点，使工作还存在着急待克服的缺点。平原、山东有些县段，灾情较重，干部认为“灾民一上堤就有饭吃”，即不分老弱一拥而上。梁山数千灾民上堤后，领不到粮，又作不到工。鄄城个别村预借粮超过了百分之百。但上堤后因堤河有水，不能工作。结果，有的做工很少，所得工资不够吃；同时也大大影响了工程，浪费了人力物力。这些错误，虽经领导上指出检查，可是某些县段还没有完全纠正。
    黄河水利委员会为了纠正这些缺点，特发出加强春工工作的指示，指出：一、加强工程组织与领导。经验证明，复堤工程不依靠发动群众，任何行政命令官僚主义都会遭到失败。各地建立各级统一的复堤指挥部，是十分必要的。但必须充分作好准备工作，避免冒然开工。必须及时进行检查，力求春工工作正常开展。各地可利用小报广播经验教训，并注意对干部的思想领导。二、春工结合生产救灾。今年春工中，以工代赈，结合救灾是我们的政治任务；但进行中必须结合工程标准。应利用灾民的劳力，很好完成春工任务。并通过春工，帮助灾民渡荒，任何的不顾工程单纯救济或只管工程不关心救灾，都是有害的。三、掌握工程质量效率。这是完成工程标准的中心环节。今年堤河存水和取土距离远，在复堤中必须加强组织教育，实行包工包作，统一土工硪工领导，开展竞赛立功，保证提高工程质量效率。四、厉行节约。今年春工在全国经济困难下进行，因此，对人力物力经费支出使用，必须正确合理，反对任何浪费。各地规定工方单价不合理的要改正，作到国家与民工两不吃亏。指示最后指出：各地应抓紧春工领导，组织力量深入检查，掌握原则，纠正偏向；同时应主动的与各级政府磋商与联系，相互配合，保证胜利完成任务。
