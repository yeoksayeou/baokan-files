　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th – Spring ploughing preparations in the vast rural areas of Northeast China are nearing completion. Local leading organs are dispatching large numbers of cadres to conduct thorough inspections to ensure a timely transition to spring ploughing. According to preliminary inspection reports from various regions, spring ploughing preparations are generally sufficient in most areas. Food, livestock, and seeds have been adequately resolved, and farmers have full confidence in fulfilling this year’s task of "increasing grain production by 14 to 20 catties per mu." In particular, regions with better harvests and more sideline production income last year have a stronger material foundation for spring ploughing. In disaster-stricken areas such as Liaoxi Province, difficulties in spring ploughing have been initially resolved due to active production and self-salvation efforts over the past winter.

　　This year, the amount of fertilizer applied in various regions is generally higher than last year. Regions applying the most fertilizer account for over 90% of the cultivated land area, while general regions are around 50% to 60%. Farmers in many regions changed the old custom of not working during the Spring Festival, striving to deliver manure before the thaw. Lanxi County, Heilongjiang Province, delivered all accumulated manure by early March. In Liaoxi Province, which accumulated the most fertilizer, all accumulated fertilizer was also delivered to the fields by the beginning of this month.

　　Regarding seed preparation, in addition to conducting field selection and individual plant selection in the autumn of last year, some disaster-stricken areas have also had enough seeds for planting through the adjustment of cooperatives and state-owned stores, as well as the assistance of bank loans. Some regions also conduct re-selection, grain selection, disinfection, and germination tests before spring ploughing to prevent the occurrence of diseases.

　　Governments at all levels and the CCP committees are paying close attention to spring ploughing preparations.

　　In preparing for spring ploughing, governments at all levels and CCP committees are paying close attention to strengthening organizational leadership. People's representative conferences, Communist Party member representative conferences, and labor model conferences in many counties, districts, and villages have focused on summarizing last year's production experience and mobilizing this year's large-scale production movement. Based on the Northeast People's Government's requirements and guidelines for this year's production increase task, various regions have carefully discussed and formulated specific production plans, and have seriously studied issues such as organizing labor mutual aid groups and improving agricultural technology. After the start of spring ploughing preparations, leading organs in various regions dispatched large numbers of cadres to the countryside. Responsible persons from some provincial and county governments and CCP committees also went to districts and villages to lead inspections, promptly discover and resolve problems in spring ploughing preparations. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government successively dispatched more than 30 cadres to various provinces to conduct key supervision and inspection. In Rehe Province, which suffered more serious disasters, Qiang Xiaochu, the second secretary of the CCP Provincial Committee, personally led more than 900 cadres to various counties in early March to assist and guide farmers in carrying out production for self-salvation and preparing for spring ploughing. The agricultural and forestry departments of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Heilongjiang provinces also sent cadres to various counties to inspect spring ploughing preparations. In addition, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and labor models in rural areas took the lead in formulating production plans, delivering manure, and selecting seeds, which also powerfully promoted farmers to actively prepare for spring ploughing. Han En, a special-class labor model in Jilin Province, led the farmers in his village to formulate a detailed production plan, deciding to increase grain production by 28 catties per mu this year, exceeding the highest production increase determined by the Northeast People's Government by 40%.

　　Leadership organs in some counties and districts still lack specific leadership

　　Although the aforementioned achievements have been made in spring ploughing preparations in various regions, some cadres are still satisfied with the gains from sideline production and are blindly optimistic about the task of increasing production. Leadership organs in some counties and districts are limited to making arrangements, plans, and general instructions and calls. Village and township cadres replace specific leadership with orders and do not participate in production to play a leading role. Therefore, the preparation for spring ploughing in some areas has fallen into a state of laissez-faire. To this end, the Northeast People's Government issued a notice on March 25 on conducting in-depth inspections of spring ploughing preparations and mobilizing spring ploughing, instructing governments at all levels to quickly organize forces, conduct in-depth inspections of the preparation of each specific task, promptly solve problems, and lead farmers to take action and enter spring ploughing in a timely manner.

　　东北大部地区春耕准备充分
    各地政府深入检查  保证及时转入春耕
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北广大农村春耕准备工作即将结束，各地领导机关正派出大批干部进行深入检查，以保证及时转入春耕。据各地初步检查报告：大部分地区春耕准备工作都较为充分，食粮、牲畜、种籽等都已获得解决，农民对完成今年“每亩地增产粮食十四斤至二十斤”的任务具有充分信心。特别是去年收成较好和副业生产收获较多的地区，春耕生产的物质基础更为雄厚。在受灾地区如辽西省由于经过去冬积极生产自救的结果，亦已初步解决了春耕困难。
    今年春耕准备中，各地施肥量普遍较去年增加。施肥最多的地区达到占耕地面积百分之九十以上，一般地区均在百分之五十至六十左右。许多地区农民改变了历年春节期间不事劳动的旧例，争取在解冻前把粪送完。黑龙江省兰西县三月初即已送完全部积粪。积肥最多的辽西省各县亦于本月初把积肥全部送到地里。
    各地对于种籽的准备，除在去年秋天普遍进行了田间选种和棵选外，部分遭受灾荒地区经过合作社和国营商店的调剂以及银行贷款的扶助，亦已足够播种需要。有些地区在春耕前并进行复选、粒选、消毒和发芽试验，以防止病害发生。
            各级政府与中共党委，均密切注意春耕准备。
    各级人民政府与中共党委，在准备春耕工作中，均密切注意加强组织领导。许多县、区、村人民代表会议和共产党员代表会议及劳动模范大会，都以总结去年生产经验与动员今年大生产运动为中心内容。根据东北人民政府关于今年增产任务的要求与方针，各地仔细讨论制订了具体的生产计划，并认真研究了组织劳动互助组与改进农业技术等问题。春耕准备工作开始后，各地领导机关并派遣大批干部下乡，若干省、县政府和中共党委负责人亦分头深入区村，领导检查，及时发现与解决了春耕准备中的问题。东北人民政府农林部先后派出三十余名干部，分赴各省有重点地进行督促检查，在灾荒较严重的热河省，中共省委第二书记强晓初亲率九百余名干部，于三月上旬分赴各县协助领导农民进行生产自救，准备春耕。辽东、辽西、黑龙江等省农林厅亦均派出干部分赴各县，检查春耕准备工作。此外，农村中的共产党员、青年团员及劳动模范带头订生产计划、送粪、选种，亦有力地推动农民积极准备春耕。吉林省特等劳动模范韩恩领导该村农民订出详细生产计划，决定今年每亩增产二十八斤粮食，超过了东北人民政府决定的最高增产量百分之四十。
            若干县区领导机关仍然缺乏具体领导
    各地春耕准备工作虽已获得上述成绩，但仍有部分干部满足于副业生产的收获，对增产任务盲目乐观；若干县区领导机关仅限于布置、计划和作一般指示号召；村屯干部则以命令代替具体领导，未参加生产中去起带头作用。因此，部分地区的准备春耕工作陷于自流。为此，东北人民政府已于三月二十五日发出深入检查春耕准备与动员春耕的通知，指示各级人民政府迅速组织力量，深入检查每项具体工作的准备情形，及时解决问题，领导农民行动起来，及时进入春耕。
