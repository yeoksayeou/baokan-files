　　Mobilizing Cotton Planting Should Not Rely on Coercive Orders
    Cadres Should Study Actual Conditions and Eliminate Farmers' Concerns
To the Editor:
    Recently, I traveled to villages under the jurisdiction of Dingxian County, Hebei Province, for some business. The party and government leaders in these places are vigorously mobilizing farmers to grow more cotton in order to implement the Central People's Government's instruction to increase the production of industrial raw materials, requiring them to plant more than 45 percent of their land with cotton. However, farmers have concerns in their minds. They believe that land suitable for cotton planting is not universal. Not to mention a large county, even within a single village, the land in the east of the village may be suitable for cotton, while the land in the south may not be. For example, last year, cotton was planted in unsuitable areas, resulting in only three to five jin of cotton being harvested per mu. Secondly, farmers are also afraid that the price of cotton will be too low to exchange for the grain that the land should produce.
    Some district and village cadres, although enthusiastic about their work, have poor working methods. They do not thoroughly understand the spirit of the government's instructions, do not do a good job of persuading and educating farmers, and do not take actual conditions into account. Therefore, many places have coercive commandism, which directly affects this year's agricultural production.
    This is a problem worthy of attention. It is hoped that cadres at the county, district, and village levels will solve this problem well.
                                           A Reader
    Editor's Note: The government provides a definite guarantee of normal profits for cotton farmers. We hope that cadres in various cotton-growing areas will carefully study the reply from the Industrial Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Agriculture in the People's Garden on April 1st, and repeatedly publicize and explain it to the farmers, so that the farmers can eliminate unnecessary concerns and plant cotton with peace of mind.

### 动员种棉不应强迫命令  干部应研究实际情况消除农民顾虑

　　动员种棉不应强迫命令
    干部应研究实际情况消除农民顾虑编辑同志：
    最近我因事到河北定县所属的村庄走了一趟。这些地方的党政领导正为贯彻中央人民政府多种工业原料的指示，大力动员农民多种棉花，要求要种自己土地的百分之四十五以上。但农民思想中是有顾虑的。他们认为适宜种棉的土地，并不是普遍的，不用说一县之大，就以一个村庄说，村东的土地适合种棉，村南就不一定行。比如，在去年，在不适宜种棉的地方种上了，结果一亩地只摘了三、五斤花。其次，农民还怕棉花的价格太低，换不出地中应产的粮食来。
    有些区村干部，虽然他们热心工作，但他们工作方法不好，不深入了解政府的指示精神，不好好说服教育农民，不照顾实际情况，因此好多地方存在着强迫命令作风，直接影响了今年的农业生产。
    这是一个值得注意的问题，希望各地县、区、村干部，很好的解决这个问题。
                                           一读者           
    编者按：植棉农民的正常利润，政府是确切保证的。我们希望各种棉地区的干部，好好研究四月一日人民园地农业部工业原料司的答复，向农民反复宣传解释，使农民消除不必要的顾虑，安心种棉。
