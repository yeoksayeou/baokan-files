Local transportation quarantine stations should cooperate with local health authorities to earnestly implement quarantine work.

Urban prevention work should focus on the living areas of poor people with the worst environmental sanitation. The directives stated that the health departments of the three major administrative regions of East China, Central South, and Southwest should list the prevention of cholera as one of the most important tasks in the first half of this year, and submit a brief report to the Central Ministry of Health every half month. All parts of South China should take immediate action; military health agencies should not only do their own work, but also assist local areas in carrying out cholera prevention work.
