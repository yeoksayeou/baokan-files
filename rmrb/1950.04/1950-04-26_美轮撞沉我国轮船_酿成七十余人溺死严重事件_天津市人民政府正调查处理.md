Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 25th: The American ship "California Bear," disregarding navigation rules, collided with the "Xin'an" ship, represented by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC)'s Huafu Company, on April 20th. After the accident, it delayed, evaded responsibility, and provided inadequate rescue, resulting in a serious incident in which seventy passengers and crew members tragically drowned.

According to reports from 24 rescued crew members of the "Xin'an" ship, including Hao Tingfen: The "Xin'an" ship (1,621 gross tons) departed from Dalian for Yantai at 17:00 (Tianjin time) on April 20th, carrying 66 passengers, 43 crew members, and cargo. Approximately two hours after departure, light fog was detected, and in accordance with navigation rules, the ship continuously sounded its horn and assigned lookouts. At approximately 21:55, the "Xin'an" ship heard a ship's horn. In addition to continuously sounding its horn, reducing speed by half, and assigning lookouts in accordance with fog navigation rules, the ship stopped at 22:02 to avoid danger. At approximately 22:05, the "Xin'an" ship spotted a giant ship (the "California Bear") approaching from the left. It immediately sounded a sharp whistle as a warning, but the American ship's course remained unchanged and continued to sail directly toward the "Xin'an" ship. At approximately 22:10, the "Xin'an" ship was violently struck at an angle by the American ship, causing a large hole approximately five feet deep and eight feet wide in the middle of the first and second holds on the left side. Seawater rushed in, and the entire ship sank in about half an hour. After causing the accident, the "California Bear" reversed and moved away from the "Xin'an" ship. The "Xin'an" ship, after being hit, immediately sounded distress signals continuously and launched a small boat for help. The horn sounded for as long as twenty minutes, but the American ship remained indifferent. The "Xin'an" ship waited for about ten more minutes, but still did not see the American ship's boat come to rescue. Subsequently, the entire ship sank. It was not until the small boat launched by the "Xin'an" ship was 50 meters away from the American ship and the survivors called for help and urged the crew to act, that the American ship finally lowered a small boat to proceed for rescue, more than thirty minutes after the "Xin'an" ship was hit. After the seven people carried by the "Xin'an" ship's small boat boarded the American ship at 22:50, it was only after repeated urging that they lowered their second small boat. Due to repeated delays in rescue, of the 109 passengers and crew members aboard the "Xin'an" ship, only 15 passengers and 24 crew members escaped, while the remaining 70 people (including the captain, chief mate, and third mate) drowned at sea. All the cargo was lost. After the incident, "Xin'an" ship crew members Ding Li and Yang Yongsen requested that the American ship send a telegram to Pacific Far East Line to be forwarded to Tianjin Huafu Company to report the incident, but this was unreasonably refused.

The "California Bear" is a new-style ship of more than 8,000 tons, equipped with radar, and should have been able to detect the "Xin'an" ship from a long distance and made preparations to avoid a collision. At the same time, according to navigation rules, when one party discovers another ship crossing its path on the right front and a collision is possible, it should promptly stop, reduce speed, or steer to the right to pass behind the other ship. However, the American ship did none of these things, resulting in the tragic sinking of the "Xin'an" ship. After the "Xin'an" ship was hit, the American ship delayed and evaded responsibility and was negligent in rescue efforts. In all these respects, the "California Bear" should bear full responsibility for the sinking of the "Xin'an" ship.

After the incident, Tianjin Huafu Company filed a complaint with the Tianjin People's Court on the 22nd, demanding that the "California Bear" be held liable for compensation for all losses of life, the ship, cargo, assets, and all criminal responsibility for inadequate rescue. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has instructed the Tianjin Maritime Affairs Bureau and relevant parties to form an investigation team, which went to the "California Bear" (which arrived at Dagukou on the 22nd) on the 23rd to investigate. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government established a Maritime Affairs Handling Committee on the 25th to investigate and handle the incident.

　　美轮撞沉我国轮船
    酿成七十余人溺死严重事件
    天津市人民政府正调查处理
    【新华社天津二十五日电】美轮“加利福尼亚金熊号”（CaliforniaBear）不遵守航海规则，于四月二十日撞沉我国华孚有限公司代理之“新安轮”；肇事后又拖延塞责，营救不力，酿成旅客船员七十人惨遭溺毙的严重事件。
    据“新安轮”上遇救的船员郝廷芬等二十四人报告：“新安轮”（总吨一六二一吨）于四月二十日十七时（天津时间）自大连开往烟台，载有客人六十六人，船员四十三人及货物等。开行后约二小时发现有薄雾，即按航海规则，连续鸣笛，派人了望。二十一时五十五分，“新安轮”闻有汽笛音，除按雾中航行规则连续鸣笛，减半速度、派人了望外，为避免危险计，更于二十二时零二分实行停车。约于二十二时五分，“新安轮”发现巨形轮船（即加利福尼亚金熊号）从左方开来，当即拉急笛鸣告，而该美轮行驶方向仍旧不变，迳直向“新安轮”驶来。约于二十二时十分，“新安轮”遭受该美轮猛烈斜撞，左侧第一、第二舱中间处破裂深达五尺，宽约八尺之大洞，海水大量涌入，约半小时后，全船沉没。“加利福尼亚金熊号”肇祸后，倒车离开“新安轮”。“新安轮”于遭撞后一面紧急连续鸣求救笛，一面放小船呼援，汽笛鸣达二十分钟之久，该美轮竟坐视不救。“新安轮”又候约十分钟，仍不见该美轮小艇来救，随即全船沉没。直至“新安轮”放下之小船距该美轮五十米时，经呼救催迫，该美轮始放一小艇前往，时距“新安轮”被撞已三十余分钟。待“新安轮”小船所载之七人登该美轮后，时已二十二时五十分，经再三催促，始将其第二小艇放下。因抢救一再拖延，“新安轮”所载之旅客船员一○九人中，除旅客十五人、船员二十四人脱险外，其余七十人（包括船长、大副、三副）均溺毙海中，所载货物已全部损失。事件发生后，“新安轮”船员丁立、杨永森要求该美轮发电太平洋远东航运公司转天津华孚公司报告经过，又遭无理拒绝。
    按“加利福尼亚金熊号”系八千吨以上之新式轮船，有雷达设备，在远距离外即可发现“新安轮”，理应预作避碰准备；同时，按航行规则，当一方发现右前方有他船横过而有碰撞可能时，应及时停车、减速或向右由他轮船尾兜过。而该美轮均不出此，致“新安轮”惨遭撞沉。“新安轮”被撞后，该美轮复拖延塞责，救援不力。凡此种种，加利福尼亚金熊号对新安轮撞沉事件应负全部责任。
    事件发生后，天津华孚公司于二十二日向天津市人民法院提出控诉，要求“加利福尼亚金熊号”负赔偿“新安轮”全部生命、船只、货物、资财等一切损失及救援不力之刑事责任。天津市人民政府已责成天津航政局与有关方面组成调查团，于二十三日前往“加利福尼亚金熊号”（该轮已于二十二日驶抵大沽口）调查。天津市人民政府已于二十五日组成海事处理委员会，着手调查处理这一事件。
