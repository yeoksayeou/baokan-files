Responding to the Call of the CCP Central Committee to Strengthen Tax Work
	Shanxi Province Adjusts Tax Cadres

	[This Dispatch] According to the Shanxi Daily News of March 18th: In order to strengthen tax work, various regions in Shanxi Province have begun to adjust tax cadres. In the past, tax cadres in the province were the weakest link in the entire government department. At the February Commissioner and County Head Conference and the Tax Bureau Branch Bureau Chief Conference, this issue was studied. It was decided to transfer strong cadres to the tax department. On March 3, the CCP Central Committee issued the "Notice on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work." The notice instructed party committees at all levels to immediately draw a cadre with the current position of minister from the party committee of each city and county in the country to take charge of the tax work of the city and county, overcome the erroneous view of undervaluing tax work in the minds of cadres, so as to ensure the complete completion of this year's tax plan. It also pointed out: "It is better for other departments to lack a minister than to let the tax agency become a weak working agency." This notice has aroused the attention of party committees at all levels in Shanxi Province. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed local party committees and county party committees to resolutely implement the decision of the Party Central Committee and draw strong cadres to engage in tax work. Party committees at all levels resolutely implemented the instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee. The Xin County Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office have decided to transfer a deputy county head, a propaganda minister, a county party committee member (current district party secretary) and two originally stronger bureau chiefs to serve as the heads of the Class A and B tax bureaus in the district. The other four Class C and D tax bureaus are all headed by the county head or deputy county head concurrently, and the deputy bureau heads are selected from the current bureau heads who are stronger. The Changzhi Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office have decided to transfer nine current ministers of the county party committee to serve as the heads of the Class A and B tax bureaus, and the other eight Class C and D tax bureaus are headed concurrently by the current ministers of the county party committee, and strong current tax bureau chiefs are transferred to serve as deputy bureau chiefs. Other special districts such as Yuci and Fenyang have also begun to adjust tax cadres. However, judging from the quality of the cadres planned to be transferred to the tax bureau, it is still not up to the requirements and should still be paid attention to.

　　响应中共中央号召加强税收工作
    山西省调整税收干部
    【本报讯】据三月十八日山西日报消息：山西省各地为加强税务工作，开始调整税务干部。该省过去税务干部是整个政府部门中较弱的一环，在二月份的专员、县长会议与税务局分县局长会议上，对此问题均进行了研究，决定调派强有力的干部到税务部门中去。三月三日中共中央发出《关于统一国家财政经济工作》的通知，该通知责成各级党委，务必立即从全国每一市、县党委中抽派一个现任部长职务的干部，担任各该市、县的税务工作，克服干部思想上存在着的轻视税务工作的错误观点，以保证今年税收计划的全部完成。并指出：“宁使其他部门缺少一个部长，而不要让税收机关成为一个弱的工作机关”。这一通知已引起山西全省各级党委的重视。中共山西省委当即指示各地委、县委坚决执行党中央的决定，抽出强的干部去从事税务工作。各级党委，坚决执行了中共中央与省委的指示。忻县地委与专署，已决定调一个副县长、一个宣传部长、一个县委（现任区委书记）与原来两个较强的局长，担任该区甲乙等税局的局长。其他四个丙丁等税局，一律由县长或副县长兼局长，副局长由现任局长中选择较强的担任。长治地委与专署，已决定抽调九个县委现任部长，担任甲乙等税局的局长，其他八个丙丁等税局，由县委现任部长兼局长，并抽调强有力的现任税局长担任副局长。其他榆次、汾阳等专区，也已开始调整税务干部。但从计划调往税局的干部质量上看，尚不够要求，仍应引起注意。
