Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 9th: The Shanghai Railway Administration is currently engaged in a struggle against bureaucratism and bureaucratic formalism to improve work efficiency. The bureaucratic style of the bureau is mainly manifested in its tendency towards bureaucratic formalism. In dealings between departments within the bureau, there is no conversation, only official documents and memos are exchanged, with multiple stamps of approval, with the result that staff members are just going round in circles of official documents, substituting the writing of official documents for practical work. Thus, the more official documents there are, the less problems are solved; the more problems are not solved, the more official documents there are, and everyone is busy running around, but the actual problems are still not quickly resolved. For example, in January, when the Engineering Department wanted to borrow a place to hold a meeting from the Office, a matter that could have been resolved with a single phone call, they insisted on sending an official document. As a result, after going through the procedures of drafting, approving, copying, proofreading, and stamping, a lot of manpower, material resources and time were wasted. On January 16, train No. 114 was delayed by three minutes. The Traffic Department and the Locomotive Department did not send personnel with a responsible attitude to investigate on the spot, but only relied on the official reports of the subordinates to shift responsibility to each other. When it could not be resolved, it was transferred to the Accident Section of the Personnel Department for handling. The Personnel Department sent an official document for investigation again, but the Traffic Department and the Locomotive Department still held their own views. As a result, the Personnel Department had to drop the matter with "minor circumstances". This incident took a total of fifty days for official documents to go back and forth. Another example is the Traffic Department’s handling of a lost telephone, where official documents traveled for 172 days, of which the official documents were left in the Traffic Department’s files for 156 days, and the problem remained unresolved.

The bureau issued a call to simplify official documents in November last year. In the past four months, although the number of official documents has been reduced and the speed of processing official documents has been accelerated, the basic problem has not been solved because everyone's ideological style has not been completely transformed, and some retained personnel have the idea that they will lose their jobs if they do not handle official documents. In order to thoroughly correct this bad style and implement the regulations of the Government Administration Council on streamlining and saving in the unified financial and economic work, the bureau has launched a struggle against bureaucratism and bureaucratic formalism. Recently, it has continuously and publicly exposed many cases to educate employees ideologically. The bureau has also formulated various specific measures to restrict the use of official documents, implement a hierarchical responsibility system for official documents, gradually implement the drafting of documents within their scope by business and technical personnel, and plan to transfer surplus clerical personnel to business personnel. The bureau has established an inspection system and organized inspection teams to go deep into various departments. If any improper or irresponsible official documents are found, they will be returned. If they stubbornly refuse to change, they will be reported and punished; for necessary official documents, they must be handled quickly and correctly.

### 上海铁路管理局展开反文牍主义斗争

　　上海铁路管理局展开反文牍主义斗争
    【新华社上海九日电】上海铁路管理局正展开反官僚主义和反文牍主义的斗争，以提高工作效率。该局的官僚主义作风主要表现为文牍主义的倾向上面。在局内各部门之间，有公事相商，互不讲话，一概行公文、写条子，重重盖章，以致工作人员只在公文里兜圈子，把办公文代替了实际工作。于是公文越多，问题越不能解决；问题越不能解决，公文也就越多，上下忙得团团转，实际问题还是不能迅速解决。如一月间工务处向办公厅借用一个地方开会，只须通一次电话即可解决的事，偏要行公文，结果经过拟稿、批行、缮写、校对、盖戳、编号等手续，浪费了许多人力物力和时间。一月十六日，一一四次列车误点三分钟。车务处和机务处并未以负责态度派员会同实地调查，只凭下级的公文报告，互相推诿责任，至无法解决时，乃移送人事处事故股处理，人事处又行公文调查一次，车务处和机务处仍是各执一词，结果人事处只得以“案情轻微”而不了了之。这一事件公文往返共费时五十天。又如车务处处理一架遗失了的电话机，公文竟旅行了一百七十二天，其中公文在车务处的卷宗里搁置了一百五十六天，问题仍未解决。
    该局在去年十一月就已提出简化公文的号召，四个月来，虽然减少了公文的数量，加快了公文处理的速度，但由于大家在思想作风上没有完全转变，有些留用人员存在着不办公文恐怕失业的思想，因此基本问题仍未解决。局方为彻底纠正这种恶劣作风，贯彻政务院统一财经工作中整编节约的规定，开展了反官僚主义、文牍主义的斗争，最近不断公开地揭发了许多事例，从思想上来教育员工。该局并订出各种具体办法，限制公文的使用，实行公文的分层负责制，逐步实施业务和技术人员拟办自己范围内的文稿，多余的文书人员有计划地转为业务人员。该局已建立起检查制度，组织检查组深入各部门，发现有使用不当或不负责任的公文即予退回，如固执不改，则予以检举和处分；对于必要的公文，则务期迅速而正确。
