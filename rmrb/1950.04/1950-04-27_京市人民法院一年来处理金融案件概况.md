[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Overview of Financial Cases Handled by the Beijing Municipal People's Court in the Past Year

　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Court established a financial team on April 28th of last year, specializing in handling cases involving illegal transactions of silver dollars, gold, silver, foreign currency, counterfeiting currency, and illegal operations of private silver firms and pawnshops. Over the past year, with the close cooperation and assistance of the Public Security Bureau, the Disciplinary Inspection Corps, the People's Bank of China, and the general public, significant achievements have been made.

　　In the early days of Beijing's liberation, the financial market was extremely chaotic, with rampant black market trading in silver dollars and U.S. dollars. In response to this situation, the former North China People's Government and the Beijing Military Control Commission promulgated financial control laws, such as the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Private Silver Firms in the North China Region" and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Gold and Silver," prohibiting the circulation and trading of silver dollars, stipulating inspection methods, and promptly dealing severe blows to those who disrupted the financial order. The open trading of silver dollars, which was prevalent in late April of last year, was basically crushed, and the crackdown on the black market trading of gold, silver, and U.S. dollars began in May. From the establishment of the financial team to the end of March this year, the Municipal People's Court received a total of 4,137 cases of financial disruption, of which 4,071 cases have been processed. Due to the strengthening of financial controls in May of last year, the number of cases solved reached 1,305. Subsequently, the number of cases gradually decreased, with only 159 cases received in October. Since the beginning of this spring, there have been even fewer cases, but the general circumstances of the cases are often more serious, such as organized silver dollar traffickers and planned trafficking and external transportation. Those who speculate in gold and silver often use legitimate operations such as pawnshops, grain stores, and department stores as cover to secretly speculate in larger quantities of gold and silver.

　　The People's Court handles cases of financial disruption based on the financial control laws promulgated by the former North China People's Government and the Municipal Military Control Commission. For general minor cases, such as ordinary illegal carrying, pricing, private trading, or attempts to preserve currency value, measures such as confiscation, devaluation, and fines are adopted, and offenders are mostly given education and released. For more serious cases, such as large-scale, planned, and organized speculation in gold and silver, disruption of the market, and counterfeiting currency, sentences of imprisonment, labor service, and heavier fines are imposed depending on the severity of the circumstances. As for silver firms, shops, and other entities that engage in financial disruption under the guise of legitimate operations, in addition to confiscating evidence, imprisonment is generally imposed.

　　According to the above-mentioned methods, in the past year, 25 cases have resulted in sentences of imprisonment, 10 cases have resulted in sentences of labor service, 1,242,371 taels of gold, 272,551 taels of silver, 44,830 silver dollars, 2,355 U.S. dollars, and 77,649,083 yuan of People's Currency have been confiscated; fines have been imposed in 227 cases, totaling 166,679,000 yuan; and 3,770 people have been educated and released.

　　京市人民法院一年来处理金融案件概况
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民法院于去年四月二十八日成立金融组，专门处理买卖银元、金银、外币、伪造货币和私营银钱业、饰物业的违法经营等案件，一年来，在公安局、纠察总队、人民银行和广大市民的密切配合协助之下，已获得显著成绩。
    北京解放初期，金融市场异常紊乱，金银美钞黑市猖獗，前华北人民政府及北京市军管会针对此一情况，公布了管制金融的法令，如华北区私营银钱业管理暂行办法和金银管理暂行办法等，禁止银元流通和买卖，规定检查办法，及时地给扰乱金融者以严重打击。去年四月底公开的银元买卖基本上被打垮，五月开始取缔金银美钞黑市。从金融组成立起至本年三月底止，市人民法院共收扰乱金融案件四千一百三十七件，业经处理完毕者四千零七十一件。去年五月份由于金融管制的加强，破案达一千三百零五起，以后案件逐渐减少，十月份收案仅一百五十九起，今春以来，案件更少，但一般的案情多较重大，如有组织的银元贩子，有计划的贩卖和外运。倒卖金银者，则多以饰物业、粮店、百货店等合法经营作掩护，暗地里倒卖较大量的金银。
    人民法院处理扰乱金融案件，是根据前华北人民政府和本市军管会颁布的管制金融法令，对一般轻微的案件，如普通的非法携带，计价行使，私相买卖，或意图保存币值者，采取没收、贬价、罚金等处分，人犯多予教育释放；案情较重大者，如巨额的，有计划的、有组织的倒卖金银，扰乱市场，伪造货币等，则视其情节轻重判处徒刑、劳役和较重的罚金。至于借合法经营而暗地进行扰乱金融的银钱业商店等，除没收证物外，一般的均处徒刑。
    根据上述办法，一年来先后判处徒刑者二十五起，判处劳役者十起，没收黄金一百二十四万二千三百七十一两，白银二十七万二千五百五十一两，银元四万四千八百三十枚，美钞二千三百五十五元，人民券七千七百六十四万九千零八十三元；判处罚金者二百二十七起，共罚款一亿六千六百七十九万元；教育释放者三千七百七十人。
