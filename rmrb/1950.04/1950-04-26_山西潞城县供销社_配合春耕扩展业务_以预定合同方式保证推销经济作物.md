	Shanxi Lucheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative
	Coordinates Spring Plowing, Expands Business
	Guarantees the Promotion of Economic Crops Through Pre-Order Contracts

	[Our Newspaper] The Lucheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province is expanding its business in response to farmers' needs and in coordination with spring plowing. The cooperative, in conjunction with the county government, made full preparations to transform the old temple fairs into new agricultural tool markets on the 24th day of the first lunar month and the 6th day of the second lunar month, utilizing the old custom of the masses attending temple fairs. Agricultural tools were sold, and agricultural tool cartoons were posted around the fair. Various prepared agricultural tools were displayed. To attract farmers to the fairs, local theatrical troupes performed new dramas related to production to inspire farmers' enthusiasm for production. According to statistics from the two fairs (Weizi Town, Chengguan), the county cooperative sold a total of 3,427 various agricultural tools such as shovels, rakes, hoes, and plows, saving the masses 3,291,000 yuan compared to purchasing at market prices (e.g., a shovel cost 25,000 yuan at market price but 17,500 yuan at the cooperative price). The members responded well.

	From March 16th to the end of the month, the county cooperative also conducted 17 in-kind (rice and wheat) pre-order contracts with 13 village cooperatives, including Wulihou and Nantao, supplying 721 various agricultural tools such as plows, seeders, rakes, and harrows at an average price of 11% lower than the market price. In addition, the county cooperative has transported the 30 head of livestock and pesticides and fertilizers ordered under contract from various brother cooperatives and higher-level cooperatives in March and is now actively preparing for distribution to support farmers in spring plowing.

	According to the county party congress and representatives' conferences, this year's production task must increase by 1.15 dou per mu and expand the planting area of economic crops. However, investigations revealed that the masses have two concerns: one is the fear of stagnant sales of products (such as cotton and peanuts last year), and the other is the fear that economic crops will not be sufficient to pay public grain. Therefore, in early April, the county supply and marketing cooperative proposed to the villages at the cooperative representatives' meeting: to guarantee the promotion of the masses' economic products after autumn and to help coordinate the public grain through pre-order contracts. The representatives unanimously said, "If this is done, it is like the county cooperative providing us with an insurance policy. We will boldly promote this to the masses when we return to the village. With the support of the county cooperative, what are we afraid of!" After the meeting, 33 village cooperatives and representatives from villages such as Luhe, Nanma, and Nanliu immediately signed pre-order contracts with the county cooperative, totaling 52,000 jin of cotton, 62,000 jin of peanuts, 5,140 jin of sesame, 8.5 shi of hemp seeds, 1,000 jin of rice, 10,000 jin of dates, and 1,600 jin of wool. They also said that they would immediately inform the surrounding villages that had not participated in the meeting to quickly sign pre-order contracts with the county cooperative.

　　山西潞城县供销社
    配合春耕扩展业务
    以预定合同方式保证推销经济作物
    【本报讯】山西省潞城县供销社针对农民需求，配合春耕，扩展业务。该社在旧历正月廿四日及二月初六日利用群众赶庙会的旧习惯，与县政府作了充分准备把旧庙会变成了新的农具市场，出售农具，并在会场周围黏贴农具漫画，将准备好的各种农具陈列起来展览。为了吸引农民前往赶集，并由当地剧团演出有关生产的新剧，以鼓舞农民生产情绪。据两个会（微子镇，城关）统计，县社共卖出锹、耢、锄、铧等各种农具三千四百二十七件，使群众比按市价买省了三百二十九万一千元（如铁锹一张，市价二万五千元，社价一万七千五百元）。社员反映良好。
    从三月十六日至月终，县社又和五里后、南桃等十三个村社进行了十七次实物（米麦）定购合同，以平均低于市价百分之十一以上的价格，供给村社犁、耧、耢、耙等各种农具七百廿一件。此外县社已将三月和各兄弟社及上级社以合同定购之牲口三十头及杀虫剂、肥料等如数运到，现正积极准备配售，扶植农民春耕。
    根据县党代会及各界代表会确定今年生产任务必须每亩增产一斗一升五。并扩大经济作物播种面积。但从调查中了解到群众对此有两种思想顾虑：一种是怕产品销路滞塞（如上年棉花、花生等），一种是怕经济作物顶不了公粮。因此，县供销社于四月上旬在合作代表会上向各村提出：以预定合同办法保证将群众的经济产品于秋后负责推销和代为调剂公粮。代表们齐声同说“如这样做，好比县社给咱打下保险条一样，咱回村就给群众大胆宣传，有县社撑腰哩，还怕什么！”会后潞河、南马、南流等卅三个村社及代表即和县社订立了预定合同，计棉花五万二千斤，花生六万二千斤，芝麻五千一百四十斤，大麻籽八石五斗，大米一千斤，枣一万斤，羊毛一千六百斤；并说回去要马上转告未来参加会的周围各村速到县社订立预定合同。（成昆五、李子峻、曹海鱼、李金昌）
