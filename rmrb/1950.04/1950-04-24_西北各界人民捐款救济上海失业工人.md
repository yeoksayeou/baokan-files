Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 23rd: The workers and people from all walks of life in the Northwest are enthusiastically launching a movement to support unemployed workers in Shanghai. Zhao Zhankui, Deputy Director of the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, said in a statement: Although we workers in the Northwest are currently in a difficult situation, we are much better off than our worker brothers in Shanghai. We fully agree with the remarks made by Mao Qihua, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, on the 17th. Northwest workers should mobilize, respond to the call of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and help our worker brothers in Shanghai overcome the current difficulties. The Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions and the Preparatory Committee of the Xi'an Federation of Trade Unions held cadre meetings on the 19th to discuss specific measures for various forms of assistance. Workers in various industries in Xi'an and staff and students of institutions and cadre schools have now generally launched donation campaigns. More than 10,000 employees of the Xi'an Railway Trade Union branch expressed their willingness to donate one day's wages to help their unemployed brothers in Shanghai. Employees of the Xi'an People's Power Plant Generating Station decided to volunteer one day of overtime work on Sunday, and donate the resulting salary. All members of the Northwest Postal Workers' Union Depot Group took the lead in donating one day's wages; subsequently, workers from units such as the Military Postal Section and the Business Section of the bureau also responded in unison. Workers at the Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau are currently engaged in a campaign to donate flour and cash. Employees of units such as the Xi'an Mass Daily, Broadcasting Station, and the Northwest Branch of the Xinhua News Agency donated one million yuan in RMB on the 19th alone. Employees of the Xi'an branch of the Shanghai Bank have donated more than 410,000 yuan in RMB and sent it to the Xi'an Federation of Trade Unions for transfer to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. In addition to the unanimous resolution of all students and staff of the Central Northwest Party School to donate one day's food expenses, most students also voluntarily donated all or half of their monthly stipends. The enthusiasm of the students at the Northwest Youth Cadre School for donation is even higher. When female worker Liu Guiying donated her one month's salary, she said excitedly: During the era when the Kuomintang bandits ruled the Northwest, I lived a life of eating cottonseed and tree bark. Today, Chairman Mao has rescued us; but many worker brothers in Shanghai are still in distress. I am willing to donate my entire month's salary to help them! In addition, organizations such as the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Democratic Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Shaanxi Democratic Women's Federation, the Xi'an Democratic Women's Federation, and the Northwest Working Committee of the Youth League are actively mobilizing women and young people to respond to this support movement.
