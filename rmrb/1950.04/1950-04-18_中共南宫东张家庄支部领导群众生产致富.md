　　CPC Nangong Dongzhangjiazhuang Branch Leads the Masses in Production for Prosperity
    The Dongzhangjiazhuang Branch of the CPC in Nangong County, Hebei Province, actively leads the masses in developing production, and the lives of the masses have gradually improved. At the beginning of this year, the entire village immediately launched various production activities.
    Harrowing and sending manure began before the Lunar New Year. Du Cunhe, a member of the branch committee, worked every day from the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month to the sixth or seventh day of the first lunar month. Village Chief Deng Tonghai and Branch Secretary Hou Guijin both started working in the fields on the afternoon of the first day of the lunar year. Under their influence and promotion, most of the masses started working on the second and third days of the new year. More than 30 households in Du Street harrowed and covered all their land by the eighth or ninth day. Farmer Guan Laofang harrowed eight mu of land on the second day of the new year. Du Debo sent 120 carts of manure to the fields from the second to the sixth day of the new year. Hou Laoyun, a 69-year-old family member of a martyr, cleaned out the pen on the first day, mashed manure on the second day, and sent the manure to the fields on the sixth day. A lively spring plowing movement was launched. No one was willing to lag behind in accumulating and sending manure. Manure pits can be seen everywhere in the village, and many households are raising pigs. Du Yannian, 65, carries three loads of water and two baskets of soil every day to pad the manure pit. Guan Laofang often goes to the motor road (where large vehicles pass) in the middle of the night to pick up manure. Everyone is competing to apply more fertilizer. Meng Xinghua originally planned to apply five large carts of manure per mu, but when he heard that Meng Qingsuo was applying seven large carts per mu, he bought another 30 jin of bean cake per mu. When Meng Qingsuo heard that he had bought bean cake, he quickly applied another eight large carts of manure to the eight fen of cotton land, striving to harvest 200 jin of cotton. He said, "Xinghua took the top spot last year (highest cotton yield), and I want to compete with him this year!" Generally, the application of fine fertilizer this year is 20 to 30 jin more per mu than last year, and the application of manure is at least three or four carts per mu. Meng Laobin, a newly liberated military dependent, only bought 600 jin of bean cake last year. This year, he bought 400 jin more than last year and accumulated ten more carts of manure. Last year, he harvested an average of more than 180 jin of cotton per mu, and this year he plans to harvest an average of 230 jin per mu. Kunshan is also a newly liberated household and plants 14 mu of cotton. This year, he applied 30 jin more of bean cake per mu, planning to harvest 40 jin more per mu than last year.
    The mutual aid and cooperative farming in Dongzhangjiazhuang is also doing well this year. Households without labor or livestock have fixed labor exchange partners. In the past, households with labor but no livestock generally exchanged grass for cattle labor. This year, in order to grow more cotton, village cadres and party members have also helped to improve the labor exchange method, using livestock for plowing, planting, and sending manure, including household grinding, at a cost of seven jin of cotton or 23 jin of rice per mu. The masses call it the "contract labor exchange system" and support it very much. After Du Cunhe, a member of the branch committee, specifically organized two households to help each other, many other households also automatically adopted this method, so that households without livestock can also grow more cotton. For widowed and orphaned households lacking both labor and livestock, grass or spinning was used for labor exchange in the past. However, because these households lack fertilizer and have low yields, village cadres and party members have helped to improve the method to inclusive planting. That is: the farming households are responsible for livestock, seeds, fertilizers, and cultivation, and the widowed and orphaned households pay public grain, and the autumn harvest is split in half. In this way, both parties are willing, and the crops can grow well. An old lady was difficult to work with so no one wanted to plant for her, so Branch Secretary Hou Guijin helped her with inclusive planting. In terms of cooperative farming, most of the 31 households of martyrs, military personnel, and workers in the village are participating in production and cultivating the land themselves, saving work points to exchange for rice. Only five households are farmed by the village because they have no labor. Last year, the work point contract farming system was implemented, and the results were good, with general cotton yields of more than 130 jin.
    Due to the bumper cotton harvest last year, the lives of the masses have gradually improved. During the autumn grain collection last year, the masses in the village delivered a large amount of cotton, and most of the masses exchanged it for grain. Half of the households in the village have enough grain to eat for two years. Only two households lacked some grain because they planted less cotton. Du Cunhe, a member of the branch committee, received 47 bags of grain for his family of seven, and he plans that he will not be able to finish eating it in three years. Many masses are planning to build houses and buy livestock to live a better life. Hou Guilai, a newly liberated household, bought a plot of land and plans to build three northern rooms, two side rooms, two western rooms, and a gatehouse within five years.
    When the lives of the masses become prosperous, they demand higher culture. The masses are paying attention to their children going to school. In the first month of the lunar year, the county-run Cuizhuang Elementary School enrolled students, and 12 male and female students from the village applied. Some even said, "After graduating from elementary school, we will also support them to go to middle school!"
    In the village, whether on the street or in the home, no matter how many people there are, they are discussing how to fertilize, how to prepare the land well, how much cotton to plant this year, and how much more to harvest than last year... Party member cadres said, "In our village, we only hear discussions about growing cotton and production, and we don't hear any idle chatter, so there are no rumors in our village."
    How did the branch lead the masses to the road of production and prosperity?
    First of all, they conscientiously implement and carry out the instructions and calls of the higher authorities, deeply understand the thoughts and specific difficulties of the masses, and try to help solve them. There are 204 households in this village, living in scattered locations in six natural villages, making leadership difficult. Based on this situation, they rarely hold mass meetings. Each time a task is assigned, the branch committee first discusses and decides, and then disseminates it to the streets through a meeting of all party members and village cadres, assigning tasks based on the nature of the task, or holding village household meetings, or going to households to promote and mobilize them. The most important thing is that party members use their own exemplary actions to drive the masses to complete the task together. Last year, during the cotton collection, the masses had some concerns about delivering cotton and were unwilling to deliver more. More than 20 village cadres and party members voluntarily delivered more than 5,000 jin of cotton, dispelling the concerns of the masses and successfully completing the task. Problems such as not having a place to dig manure pits for accumulating fertilizer and how to find labor exchange partners were all reported to the branch by party members who went deep into the masses to understand the situation, and then studied and resolved. In the past two years, when large ridge cotton was promoted, the masses were unwilling to grow more. In addition to growing more himself, Du Cunhe of the branch committee personally helped others plant the land, trying to plant a little first. In the autumn, the large ridge cotton yielded a lot, and the masses all regretted it, saying, "We should have listened to Cunhe!" Recently, many households want to grow more cotton, but there are not enough seeds. The branch immediately called on people to borrow and exchange with each other to ensure that there was borrowing and repayment. Hou Guijin, secretary of the branch, and Du Cunhe, a member of the branch committee, took the lead in voluntarily lending or exchanging their surplus cotton seeds to the masses. Hou Guijin alone lent or exchanged more than 170 jin, driving the masses to borrow and exchange with each other, solving the difficulty of cotton seeds. In short, after accepting tasks from higher authorities, they do not only make general appeals, but also go deep into solving specific problems and actively take the lead in doing practical work.
    Secondly, the branch has a democratic style. The branch often invites representative farmers to meet and study to solve the difficulties and ideological problems in production, and to understand the masses' implementation of the production plan. When the branch meeting or party member meeting studies production, labor models and production activists are also invited to attend and solicit opinions widely in order to promote production.
    Thirdly, party members and village cadres themselves are production activists, never idle, and never use official business as an excuse to send the masses to work for them. For example, when the county and district convene meetings, party members and village cadres never shirk their responsibilities or are absent, and they always rush to finish the work at home and fill the water tank before leaving. This time, the village loaned 15,000 jin of bean cake, and party members and village cadres all prioritized the masses' loans. The masses believe that party members and cadres are selfless and support them very much. Therefore, party members and cadres can drive the masses to complete tasks, and the masses actively respond to the call and follow them.

　　中共南宫东张家庄支部领导群众生产致富
    河北省南宫县东张家庄支部积极领导群众发展生产，群众生活已逐渐上升，今年一开春，全村立即展开各种生产活动。
    耙地送粪在旧历年前就已开始。支委杜存和从旧历腊月二十到正月初六、七，没有一天不做活。村长邓通海和支书侯贵金都是初一下午就下地干活。在他们影响推动下，初二、三大部分群众都动起手来。杜街三十多户到初八、九就把地全部耙盖了一遍。农民关老芳正月初二那天就耙了八亩地。杜德波从初二到初六送了一百二十车粪到地里。六十九岁的烈属侯老云初一除圈，初二捣粪，初六就把粪送到地。热火朝天的春耕运动开展起来了。积肥送粪谁也不肯落后。全村到处可以看到粪坑，许多户都喂着猪，六十五岁的杜延年每天担三担水挑两筐土垫粪坑。关老芳常常半夜到汽车路（走大车）上去拾粪。大家都比着多施肥，孟兴华本打算每亩上粪五大车，听说孟庆锁每亩上七大车，他又每亩买了三十斤豆饼。孟庆锁听说他买了豆饼，赶快又在八分棉地上了八大车粪，争取收棉二百斤。他说：“去年兴华坐了头把交椅（棉花收成最多），今年我要和他比比！”一般今年施细肥每亩比去年多二十到三十斤，上粪每亩至少也是三、四车。新翻身的军属孟老彬去年只买六百斤豆饼，今年比去年多买了四百斤，并多积了十车粪，去年平均每亩收一百八十多斤棉花，计划今年每亩平均收二百三十斤。昆山也是新翻身户，种十四亩棉花，今年每亩多上三十斤豆饼，计划每亩比去年多收四十斤。
    东张家庄的互助代耕今年也做的好。无劳力、无牲口户都固定了换工对象。过去一般是有劳力无牲口的以草换牛工，今年为了多种棉花，村干部党员又帮助改进换工办法，使用牲口耕、耩、送粪，包括家庭活碾磨，每亩地代价棉花七斤或米二十三斤，群众称为“包干换工制”，很拥护。在支委杜存和具体组织了两户互助后，其他许多户也自动采用这种方法，使没牲口的户也能多种棉花。劳力畜力均缺的孤寡户，过去以草或纺线换工。但因这些户肥料缺、产量低，今年村干部、党员又帮助改进为大捎种办法。就是：牲口、籽种、肥料、耕作都由种地户负责，孤寡户出公粮，秋后收成对半分。这样两相情愿，庄稼也能长好。有一个老太太因为脾气不好，别人都不愿给她种，支书侯贵金便给他捎种起来。代耕方面，全村三十一户烈、军、工属，大部分都参加生产，自己耕种，省下工票兑换成米。只有五户因没劳力，由村代耕。去年实行工票包耕制，成绩不错，一般棉花也收到一百三十多斤。
    由于去年棉花丰收，群众生活逐渐上升起来了。去年秋征时该村群众大量交棉，大部群众都换回谷子，全村有二分之一的户存有二年吃不完的粮食。只有两户因种棉少，粮食缺些。支委杜存和全家七口人，领回四十七袋谷子，他计划一下三年也吃不完，许多群众都在计划盖房、买牲口，把日子过得更好。新翻身户侯贵来买了一所宅基，计划五年内盖三间北屋、两间耳房、两间西屋、一个门楼。
    群众生活富裕了就要求提高文化。群众对儿女上学读书都注意起来。旧历正月，县立崔庄高小招生，该村就有十二名男女生投考，有的还说：“高小毕业，再供上中学！”
    在村里，无论大街上、家庭里，也不管人多人少，都是议论着如何施肥呀，如何打整好地呀，今年种多少棉花呀，比去年争取多收多少呀……党员干部说：“俺村除了研究种棉、生产，听不到闲扯，所以俺村也没有谣言。”
    支部是怎样领导群众走上了生产致富的道路呢？
    首先，他们认真执行和贯彻上级的指示和号召，深入了解群众思想和具体困难，并设法帮助解决。这村共二○四户，住地分散，共有六个自然村，领导是困难的。根据这种情况，他们很少开群众大会，每次任务下来时，支委先讨论决定，通过全体党员村干部会议布置到街，分别任务性质，或召开片户会，或分别深入到户宣传动员。而最重要的是党员以自己的模范带头行动，带动群众一起完成任务。去年征棉时，群众对交棉有些顾虑，不愿多交。二十多名村干部党员自动多交棉五千多斤，打破了群众顾虑，顺利完成了任务。如积肥没处挖粪坑，换工时怎样找对象等问题，都是由党员分别深入群众了解情况汇报支部，而后研究解决的。在前二年推广种大垅棉时，群众不愿多种，支委杜存和除自己多种外，还亲自帮别人耩地，试着先少种些。秋后大垅棉收的多，群众都后悔了，说：“该听存和的话！”最近有许多户想多种棉，但籽种不够。支部即号召互借互换保证有借有还。支书侯贵金、支委杜存和，首先自动把自己多余的棉籽借或换给群众。只侯贵金就借或换出一百七十多斤，带动群众也互借互换起来，解决了棉籽的困难。总之，他们接受上级任务后，不是只作一般号召，而是深入解决具体问题，积极带头实干。
    其次支部作风民主。支部经常邀请有代表性的农民开会研究解决生产中的困难和思想问题，并从中了解群众对生产计划执行情形。支部会或党员会研究生产时也邀请劳动模范与生产积极分子列席参加，广泛征求意见，以便推动生产。
    第三，党员村干部自己都是生产积极分子，从不游手好闲，也从不借口公事支派群众替自己作活。如县、区召集会议时，党员村干部从不推诿缺席，而且都是先把家里活赶出来，把水挑满缸以后再走。这次该村贷到豆饼一万五千斤，党员村干部都是尽着群众先贷。群众都认为党员干部大公无私，十分拥护。因此党员干部就能带动群众完成任务，群众都积极响应号召跟着他们走。
