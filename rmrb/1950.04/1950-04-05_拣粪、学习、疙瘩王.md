　　“Picking Manure, Studying, and G疙瘩王”
　　Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Yu Tinggui

　　That day, Old Shi got out of bed and saw a note stuck on his door. It said: "Picking Manure, Studying, G疙瘩王."

　　"What's going on?" Old Shi was puzzled. He ran to the winter school to ask the teacher.

　　After the teacher explained, Old Shi was delighted. The village was praising him! Old Shi had picked over forty cartloads of manure and chopped over seven thousand jin of 疙瘩 (tree stumps) during the winter, and had learned five hundred characters in the winter school. Everyone said, "Old Shi combines three models in one; isn't he a 'King'!"

　　From then on, the villagers called him "Picking Manure Studying G疙瘩王" and no longer called him "Bookworm" or Shi Chengfa.

　　At the literacy model award ceremony in Songjiang Province, Old Shi was selected as a special-class literacy model. Chairman Feng personally put a big red flower on him. All the literacy models in the province knew his nickname – Picking Manure Studying G疙瘩王. The whole venue shouted loud slogans: "Learn from G疙瘩王!" "Keep up with G疙瘩王!" More than twenty models challenged him. This "literary and martial arts proficient" peasant had become a banner for the whole province.

　　Shi Chengfa lives in Hexing Village, Juren Township, Second District of Bin County, and is twenty-eight years old this year. During the puppet Manchukuo regime, he was tormented by landlords, and was forced to do corvée labor six times, for a total of one year and eight months, being beaten six times a day.

　　Now Old Shi is different. He has been allocated four qing and four mu of land, four and a half rooms of house, and a mule. Life is getting better and better every day, and he is working harder and harder.

　　However, Old Shi always felt that something was missing. Once, he was chatting with a group of people in the village, and he said: "When we struggled against the landlords, we struggled everything out! There is one thing we haven't struggled out yet!" Everyone asked him what it was that hadn't been struggled out. Old Shi said: "They have culture, and we are still illiterate. It is that culture has not been liberated."

　　Last winter, the government called for winter schools to be established, and Old Shi was very happy. From the first day of school, he had never missed a class. His home was three and a half li away from the winter school, but he arrived earlier than everyone else every day. He took the lead in firing the stove and lighting the lamps. Before school ended, he went to the teacher every day to get two characters, reciting them as he walked and memorizing them when he got home. His active learning influenced many people, and the students elected him as the chairman of the winter school.

　　Every night when he got home, he had to study for a while, reviewing the characters he had learned that day. When he went to bed, he kept scratching his stomach. His wife felt sorry for him: "Your lice are all from going to winter school. Don't go anymore!" He laughed: "What lice! I'm writing characters." His wife muttered, "You're not sleeping properly in bed, what are you writing?" He said, "Thinking with my heart and drawing with my hand, that's called being focused."

　　When he went to the well to fetch water, he would put down the bucket and write characters on the snow or water with his carrying pole when there were many people waiting. When he defecated, he would also use a grass stalk to draw on the ground. Once, Zhao Chengguo from his village saw him and asked him what he was drawing. He said, "Writing characters! This is called killing two birds with one stone." Therefore, everyone gave him the first nickname, called "Bookworm."

　　He got up every day at dawn to pick up manure, and after eating, he went to chop tree stumps. In his carrying basket, one end contained his book bag and the other end contained an abacus. When he was tired from chopping tree stumps in the field and rested, he would take out the book and read. When he rested again, he would play with the abacus for a while. Therefore, his production was good, and his studies were good.

　　He had the spirit of asking about characters whenever he saw something, learning whatever he encountered. When he was carrying water, he didn't know how to write the character "carry," so he ran to Old Guan in the village to ask. Once, he helped a military family chop firewood, and he asked them about the characters "chop" and "axe." When his sister got married, he went to see her off, and he even read a book at his brother-in-law's house.

　　He not only studied well himself, but also was good at helping others. Students in the village often asked him about characters, and sometimes many students gathered at his house. He led everyone to write, filling the top of the cabinet and the walls with writing. Bai Xiwen, Sun Ronghe, and Zhao Fenglin in the village didn't go to school, but after he persuaded them, they all went to study. Bai Xiwen had a large family and was too busy with work and school every day, so Old Shi helped him carry water.

　　Man Cui, a military family member in the village, was unwilling to study. Old Shi said to her, "Why don't you go? If your husband sends a letter from the front, it would be great if you could read it yourself!" After he persuaded her, she also went to school. Eight families lived in his yard, and he organized his wife, uncle, brother, sister-in-law, and four or five other women to study. He taught them the characters he had learned every day. Now, these people all know seventy or eighty characters.

　　In addition to this, he also took the lead in other matters in the village. When he participated in the winter school model award ceremony in the district, he heard the government call for buying public bonds, and he was the first to buy two shares. After returning home, he persuaded his wife and sister-in-law to sell their children's unicorn locks and bracelets, and bought four more shares of public bonds. This influenced the whole village, and the purchase of public bonds exceeded the target by twenty percent. He also went to villages throughout the village to promote it.

　　After he was selected as a special-class literacy model in the province, he said: "I, Old Shi, never thought I could become a literacy model. These benefits are all given to me by the People's Government, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. I must study harder and make sure that I can recognize a thousand characters by the end of the year, and also motivate others to study."

### “拣粪、学习、疙瘩王”

　　“拣粪、学习、疙瘩王”
    本报特约通讯员  于廷贵
    这一天，老石刚起床，一看门上，不知谁给他贴了一个条子：“拣粪、学习、疙瘩王”。
    “咋回事？”老石摸不到头。跑到冬学里去问老师。
    经老师一说，老石可乐了。村里表扬他啦。老石一冬拣了四十多车粪、打了七千多斤疙瘩（树槎子），在冬学里又学会了五百个字。大伙都说：“老石一身兼三个模范，还不是一个‘王’吧！”
    从此，村里人都管叫他“拣粪学习疙瘩王”，不再叫他“书迷”，也不叫他石成发了。
    松江省开奖励识字模范大会，老石被选为特等识字模范。冯主席亲手给他带上大红花。全省的识字模范都知道了他的外号——拣粪学习疙瘩王。全场喊着响亮的口号：“向疙瘩王学习！”“向疙瘩王看齐！”二十几个模范向他挑了战。这一个“文武双全”的庄稼汉，已是全省的旗帜了。
    石成发住在宾县二区居仁村和兴屯，今年二十八岁。伪满时给地主抗活受折磨不算，还给摊了六回劳工，整整一年零八个月，一天挨过六次揍。
    如今的老石不同哪，分了土地四垧四，房子四间半，还有一匹骡子。日子一天一天好起来，干活越干越有劲。
    可是，老石总是觉得还缺少一些什么。有一次，他和屯里一伙子唠喀，他说：“咱们斗争地主时，什么都斗出来啦！有一样咱还没斗出来呢！”大伙问他还没斗出来的是什么。老石说：“人家有文化，咱还是睁眼瞎。就是文化还没有翻身。”
    去年冬天政府号召办冬学，老石可高兴了。从上学的第一天起，一直没缺过课。他家离冬学有三里半地，可是他每天比别人到得早。烧炉子、点灯，都由他带头。临放学时，他每天到老师跟前领两个字，一边走一边念着，回到家就背熟了。他这样积极学习，影响了很多人，学员们把他选为冬学的主席。
    他每天晚上回了家，总得还学习一会，温习一天学的字。睡到床上，他老是抓肚子。他媳妇可怜他了：“你这些虱子，尽上冬学去的。以后可别去啦！”他发笑了：“啥虱子呀！我写字呢。”媳妇嘀咕起来了：“躺在被窝里还不好好睡觉，写啥字呢？”他说：“用心想，用手划，这叫专门。”
    到井沿去挑水，碰到人多要等一会的时候，他就放下水桶，用扁担在雪上、水上写字。解大便时，也拿个草棍子在地上划。有一次被本屯的赵成国看见了，问他划个啥。他说：“写字呢！这叫一使两用。”因此，大家给他起了第一个外号，叫做“书迷”。
    他每天天一亮就起来拣粪，吃完饭就去打树槎子，他的挑筐里，一头放着书口袋，一头放着算盘。在地里打树槎子累了休息的时候，就把书拿出来看。再休息的时候，就打一会算盘。因此，他的生产搞得好，学习也搞得好。
    他有看物就问字的精神，碰到什么就学什么。他在挑水时，不会写“挑”字，就跑去问屯里老关头。有一次，他帮一家军属劈柴，他就问人家“劈”字和“斧”字。他妹子出嫁时，他去送亲，在妹夫家里还看了一回书。
    他不独自己学得好，而且还善于帮助别人。屯子里学员经常向他问字，有时很多学员聚集在他家。他领着大家写，把柜头上、墙上都写满啦。屯里白喜文、孙荣和、赵凤林不上学，经他说服动员，都去学习了。白喜文家里人多，每天干活上学忙不过来，老石就帮他挑水。
    屯里军属满崔氏不愿学习。老石对她说：“你怎不去呢？你丈夫从前方来个信，你要识字的话，自己看多好！”经他一劝，她也上学了。他的院子里住着八户人，他把自己的老婆、大爷、哥哥、嫂子和其他四、五个妇女组织起来学习。他每天把学来的字教给他们。现在，这些人都认识了七八十个字了。
    除此以外，他在屯子里别的事情上也是带头的。他在区上参加奖励冬学模范大会时，听到政府号召买公债，他首先买了两分。回家之后，又动员老婆和嫂子把小孩的麒麟锁和手镯子卖了，又买了四分公债，这样影响了全屯，买公债超过任务二十分。他还到过全村各屯去宣传。
    他被选为全省特等识字模范之后，他说：“我老石没想到能当上识字模范，这些好处都是人民政府、共产党和毛主席给我的。我一定要更加好好学习，保证到年底能识一千字，还要把别人推动起来。”
