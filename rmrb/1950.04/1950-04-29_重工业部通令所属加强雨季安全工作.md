　　Xinhua News Agency, April 28th—In view of the upcoming rainy season, the Ministry of Heavy Industry recently issued a notice to its subordinate enterprises to strengthen safety work during the rainy season in order to protect national property and materials from damage. The notice requires: (1) Enterprises must conduct thorough inspections of workshops, warehouses for military supplies, ammunition, chemical raw materials, mechanical equipment, and other important buildings, checking for roof leaks, foundation subsidence, drainage ditch blockages, wall cracks and tilts, surrounding holes, and whether electrical equipment such as electric meters and wires are susceptible to moisture and fire. If any of the above problems are found, repairs and construction should be carried out in a timely manner for improvement. If the location and equipment of important warehouses are unsuitable (such as being close to water pits or rivers), suitable locations and sturdy buildings should be selected, and ventilation, moisture-proof, and other safety equipment should be strengthened.
    (2) Equipment that should not be stored in the open air should be moved indoors as much as possible or given appropriate protection to avoid rain or being washed away by water.
    (3) For warehouses (or basements) containing medicines that are sensitive to vibration and prone to explosion (such as mercury fulminate), as well as other explosives and bombs, the moisture-proof and waterproof equipment must be carefully inspected. If the location of the warehouse is found to be unsuitable, it should be relocated in a timely manner, and safety equipment should be strengthened to the extent possible, such as installing lightning rods to prevent lightning strikes during rain.
    (4) Drying rooms for degreased cotton, nitrocotton, etc., and drying rooms for wooden boards and lumber in smokeless powder factories must be carefully inspected for any leaks (such as rat holes), etc., and should be repaired immediately, adding moisture-proof, rain-proof, and fire-prevention equipment.
    (5) After each rain, all workshops and warehouses must be thoroughly inspected. If leaks are found, they should be repaired promptly to avoid danger and loss due to unnoticed dampness.
    The notice requires responsible persons of each enterprise and factory to personally study the above work, make careful arrangements, mobilize the masses of workers to launch discussions, formulate specific plans, and carry out various organizational and safety inspection work in a timely manner to ensure the safe progress of production.

　　重工业部通令所属加强雨季安全工作
    【新华社二十八日讯】鉴于雨季来临，重工业部最近通知所属各企业单位加强雨季安全工作，以保护国家财产物资不受损毁。通知要求：（一）对工房及军火弹药、化学原料、机械器材等仓库和重要建筑物，各企业要彻底进行下列检查，如屋顶是否漏水，地基是否下塌，水沟是否通畅，墙壁有否裂痕和倾斜，四周是否有孔穴，以及电表电线等电气设备是否可能受潮滋火等。如发现以上问题，应及时进行修理建筑，加以改善。重要仓库之位置设备不妥者（如靠近水坑河流等）应选择适当地点及牢固房子，并应加强其通风防潮等安全设备。
    （二）对不应露天存放之器材，应尽量移置于屋内或作适当的防范避免雨淋或被水冲走。
    （三）对怕震动易爆炸的药品（如雷汞等）及其他炸药、炸弹等库房（或地下室）更要缜密检查其防潮防水等设备，如发现库房位置不适当者，应及时进行迁移，并在可能范围内，加强安全设备，如按装避雷针，以防下雨时之雷电击爆等。
    （四）制造无烟药工厂之脱脂棉硝化棉等烘干室及木板木料等烘房，更要详细检查有无漏洞（如老鼠打洞）等，并应即速修理，增添防潮防雨防火之设备。
    （五）在每次雨后要对所有工房库房进行详细检查，发现漏水时及时修理，以免湿潮后不能发觉，而出危险遭受损失。
    通告要求各企业工厂负责人对上述工作亲作研究，认真布置，发动工人群众展开讨论，拟出具体计划，并及时进行各项组织工作和安全检查工作；以保证生产的安全进行。
