Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 26th: The troops of the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army are actively reclaiming wasteland and began spring plowing and sowing work in early April. Many troop reclamation areas in southern Xinjiang are now covered with greenery, with hundreds of thousands of mu of wheat, beans, and rapeseed seedlings growing vigorously. Water conservancy projects are also being actively carried out in various places, and water conservancy construction projects capable of irrigating 500,000 mu of land have been completed in the southern Xinjiang area.

According to incomplete statistics, the troops stationed in southern Xinjiang and the directly subordinate teams of the military region have reclaimed 100,000 mu of wasteland, and 70,000 mu have been sown, close to completing half of the original plan. Among them, a certain division that participated in the Nanniwan Great Production Movement has completed 80% of its original plan to reclaim 60,000 mu. Spring wheat, rapeseed, flax, and beans have mostly been sown, and rapeseed seedlings have already emerged from the soil. After April 10th, the division entered the intense stage of sowing cotton. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi has reclaimed nearly 100,000 mu. The troops stationed in Ningxia have reclaimed more than 42,000 mu of raw and cultivated wasteland. The production team of 2,000 people organized by the troops stationed in Qinghai is actively reclaiming wasteland, and the plan set by the unit is to reclaim 39,000 mu.

The troops stationed in southern Xinjiang have completed water conservancy construction projects capable of irrigating 500,000 mu of land, including the renovation of the Bachu Honghai Reservoir (previously mistakenly referred to as the Honghai Reservoir), which can irrigate 300,000 mu; the Hami canal project, which can irrigate 80,000 mu; the renovation of more than 220 li of old canal main lines, which can irrigate 100,000 mu; and the renovation of scattered canals in various places, which can irrigate 20,000 mu. The construction of the 40-kilometer-long Huang Canal and its branch lines by the troops stationed in the Ili area is nearing completion, and it can irrigate more than 320,000 mu. The troops stationed in Dihua began constructing the 17-kilometer-long Peace Canal in early February. After completing the work of hauling 11,200 tons of stone, they are now actively carrying out the work of laying stones and building the canal, which can irrigate more than 100,000 mu after completion. A certain regiment of the troops stationed in Qinghai is building the Changsheng Canal on the south bank of the Huangshui River, which is more than 30 li long. After its completion, it can turn more than 10,000 mu of barren land in the suburbs of Xining into fertile fields.

In the production and construction work, cadres at all levels and heroic models are at the forefront of production. Chen Dongguo, Commander of the Baoji Military Sub-district in Shaanxi, personally led the soldiers of the 5th Company of a certain regiment into the reclamation area and worked with the soldiers to reclaim wasteland, plow the land, and weed. Many regimental, battalion, and company-level cadres of many troops participated in labor with squads, platoons, and soldiers. Du Lihai, a heroic company commander of a certain unit stationed in Shaanxi, led the entire company to create a record of reclaiming 130 mu of wasteland in three days. All the commanders and fighters of the 2nd Battalion of a certain unit stationed in Xinjiang voluntarily proposed to not only provide themselves with grain and vegetables for the whole year, but also guarantee to pay 500,000 jin of grain to the state.

A certain unit stationed in northern Xinjiang (originally a "former uprising unit") actively participated in the production movement under the influence of other fraternal units after more than two months of ideological education. All commanders and fighters voluntarily invested cash and materials as production funds to purchase agricultural tools and seeds, solving the difficulties in production, and entered the production front line one after another in the late last month. This year, the unit plans to reclaim 70,000 mu, and it is estimated to produce 5,600 shi of wheat and 1,600 shi of sorghum, striving to be self-sufficient in food and fodder for three to four months, self-sufficient in meat and lamp oil for half a year from June, and self-sufficient in vegetables and edible salt for the whole year. All commanders and fighters have been plunged into a production upsurge.

The masses in the areas where the troops are stationed are extremely moved by the troops' enthusiasm for labor. Residents in the area where a certain army is stationed in Shaanxi said: "When you first came to dig the land, we thought it was an exercise. Now we know that you are really farming and reducing our burden. This kind of army is really rare in ancient times!"

　　西北军区部队开荒播种
    南疆垦区成一片绿野
    水利修建工程完成可灌地五十万亩
    【新华社兰州二十六日电】人民解放军西北军区部队积极进行开荒，并已于四月上旬开始春耕播种工作。南疆许多部队垦区现在已是到处一片绿野，茁长着成千成万亩数的麦类、豆类和油菜的幼苗。各地水利修建工程亦正在积极展开，南疆地区已完成可灌地五十万亩的水利修、建工程。
    据不完全统计：南疆驻军及军区直属队已开荒十万亩，并已有七万亩下种，接近完成原计划之半；其中曾参加南泥湾大生产运动的某师，已完成原订开荒六万亩计划的百分之八十。春麦、油菜、胡麻、豆类均已大部下种，油菜绿苗已经出土。四月十日以后该师已进入紧张的播种棉花阶段。驻陕西的解放军已开荒近十万亩。宁夏驻军已开生、熟荒四万二千余亩。青海驻军组织的两千人的生产队正积极进行开荒，该部所订计划为开荒三万九千亩。
    南疆驻军已完成可灌地五十万亩的水利修建工程，包括巴楚洪海水库（前误为红海水库）的整修，可灌地三十万亩：哈密水渠工程，可灌地八万亩；整修旧水渠干道二百二十余里，可灌地十万亩；整修各地零星水渠，可灌地二万亩。伊犁区驻军兴修的长四十公里的皇渠及其支线即可完成，可灌地三十二万余亩。迪化驻军于二月初开始修建长十七公里的和平渠，于完成拉石一万一千二百吨的工作后，现正积极进行铺石筑渠工作，落成后可灌地十万余亩。青海驻军某团修筑湟水南岸的长胜渠，长三十余里，修成后可使西宁城郊万余亩瘠地变成良田。
    在从事生产建设中，各级干部和英雄模范都站在生产前列。陕西宝鸡军分区陈栋国司令员亲自带领某团五连战士进入垦区，和战士们一齐动手开荒、犁地、锄草。很多部队的团、营、连级干部都参加到班、排和战士们一起劳动。驻陕西某部英雄连长杜立海，领导全连创造三天开荒一百三十亩的纪录。新疆驻军某部二营全体指战员，自动提出除自给全年粮食、菜蔬外，并保证向国家缴纳粮食五十万斤。
    驻北疆的某部（原起义部队”经过两个多月的思想教育后，在其他兄弟部队带头影响下，也积极投入生产运动中。全体指战员自动以现金、实物投作生产资金，购买农具、种籽，解决了生产中的困难，已于上月下旬先后进入生产前线。今年该部计划开荒七万亩，预计生产小麦五千六百石、高粱一千六百石，争取自给三至四个月的粮食、马料，自六月份起自给半年的吃肉、灯油，自给全年的菜蔬、食盐。全体指战员已投入生产热潮中。
    各部驻地所在的群众对部队的劳动热忱极为感动。陕西某军驻地的居民说：“你们刚来挖地时，我们认为是在演习，现在才晓得是真做庄稼，减轻我们的负担。这种队伍真是古来少见！”
