　　Spring in Yunnan
    Guo Yi, Zhan Chao

    I. The Red Flag Flies Over Wuhua Mountain

    March 4, 1950, was an epoch-making day in Yunnan—the Kunming Municipal Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was established, proclaiming that the people had officially become the masters of this beautiful city.

    On this day, the sky over Kunming was exceptionally blue. A red five-star flag fluttered in the wind on Wuhua Mountain. This flag was obtained through the long-term struggle of the people of Yunnan. When it first appeared in Kunming last winter, it inspired countless people. That was on the morning of December 10th. In the revolutionary storm that swept across Southwest China, General Lu Han, in accordance with the wishes of the 13 million people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, announced his defection from the Kuomintang reactionary government and acceptance of the leadership of the Central People's Government, and Yunnan was thus declared peacefully liberated. In the same month, hundreds of thousands of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army marched into Yunnan in several routes, combining with the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column and the people of Yunnan, crushing the counterattacks of the remaining bandit troops of the 26th Army and the 8th Army, and annihilating them all in southern Yunnan, so that the entire province of Yunnan was liberated. On February 20th of this year, Generals Chen Geng and Song Renqiong led the People's Liberation Army into Kunming and began to establish a people's democratic dictatorship. From then on, the destiny of the people of Yunnan was in their own hands, and a brand-new Yunnan was born. This series of major historical events happened to occur in the season when the harsh winter was passing and the new spring was arriving. People caressed their wounds and stared at the fluttering red flag, and for the first time felt: Spring has truly arrived.

    II. The Great Meeting of History

    In the encirclement and annihilation campaign against the bandit troops of the 26th Army and the 8th Army in the thousands of mountains and rivers of southern Yunnan, the PLA units entering Yunnan to fight and the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column, which persisted in the liberation war behind enemy lines, joined forces. This was a day that people longed for so much. When we were fighting on the Guangdong front, we heard the news that the Dian-Gui Border Column of the People's Liberation Army was rapidly developing and growing stronger, which powerfully encouraged our determination to advance. Similarly, when the news that we had crossed the Yangtze River reached Yunnan, our brothers and the people behind enemy lines were so excited that they shed tears. The long-awaited day finally came. On January 2nd, the People's Liberation Army was ordered to enter Yunnan from the Bose area of Guangxi, and the comrades of the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column provided the greatest support. They rushed more than 200 li of mountain roads overnight and built more than 40 bridges with stones and wood on the Yunnan-Guangxi border. They transported bags of rice from hundreds of li away to the roadside, reducing their meal ration from one jin to twelve liang, saving the rest to supply the brother troops.

    When the two troops met on the Yunnan-Guangxi border line, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army were moved to tears when they saw that their class brothers were still wearing single clothes in this freezing season, their clothes were torn, exposing their flesh, and they were not wearing shoes. The soldiers hurriedly took off their clothes and gave them to their brothers who persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines.

    The Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column developed and grew stronger in hardship. In April 1948, the people of the Guishan area in southeastern Yunnan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched an armed uprising and raised the red flag of the people of Yunnan's struggle. They fought a desperate battle, crushed the enemy's attack on a regiment, crossed the Panjiang River southward, and victoriously joined forces with the Gui-Dian Border Column (part of the Liangguang Column) on the Yunnan-Vietnam border and the Gui-Dian border area. They conducted rectification under extremely difficult conditions where jungles and miasma were rampant, and materials and medicine were extremely scarce. In October 1948, they were ordered to move north, successively crossed the Gou Lou Mountains and the Liu Zhao Mountains, which were as high as 3,000 meters, broke through the enemy's blockade, marched continuously for fourteen days and nights in the scorching sun and heavy rain, annihilated all enemies who dared to prevent their advance, and successfully completed the task of opening up the southeastern Yunnan base area. Within a year, they grew ten times stronger, liberating 31 county towns (as of August 1949) and more than 4 million people, opening up a smooth road for the liberation of Yunnan. Today, they have joined hands with their brother troops to encircle and annihilate the remaining enemies.

    In December last year, the East Route PLA troops entering Yunnan defeated the Kuomintang remnants' counterattack on Kunming. The South Route PLA troops entering Yunnan entered Yunnan from the Bose area of Guangxi on January 2nd. With the cooperation of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army and the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column, they annihilated more than 30,000 people of the Kuomintang remnants of the 8th Army, the 26th Army, etc. In this campaign, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army climbed mountains and waded through rivers, passed through malaria-ridden areas, advanced more than 2,000 li in thirty days, and carried out day and night pursuit battles, creating a rare example of arduous marches.

    III. Thousands of Miles of Plateau, United in Hatred Against the Enemy

    Along these thousands of miles of transportation lines, Yunnan farmers used their greatest strength to support the advance and combat of 200,000 troops. Funing County in southeastern Yunnan, with a population of 50,000, is an extremely poor county, but in just over 20 days, they raised 800,000 jin of grain to support the passage of 100,000 troops westward to pursue and annihilate bandit troops. Farmers in Luoping County, eastern Yunnan, welcomed their own army by feeding chickens and planting vegetables several months in advance. As the chickens grew bigger and the vegetables grew taller, they sold the eggs and vegetables and exchanged them for fruits to preserve, waiting for the troops to arrive.

    From their long-term disastrous lives, Yunnan farmers realized that the complete victory of the People's Liberation War was linked to their fate. In a letter of condolences to the People's Liberation Army, farmers in the Niutou Mountain area of Luliang County accused the Kuomintang bandit troops of their crimes, saying: "We will always remember the father and son who sold noodles and were buried alive in Xihua Temple, the two farmers who were skinned alive, the tragic burning in Hongjinzhai, the looting from house to house in the Sanchahe area, the five old people who were beheaded in Gou Dian, and the week-long mass rape committed by bandit troops in another place... In that dark time, there were no pedestrians on the road, no transactions in the market, no cooking smoke in the houses, and no rooster crows in the villages." Life could not continue, and they rose up in resistance. The letter said: "We organized under the leadership of the Communist Party, using justice to fight against tyranny, and using primitive weapons such as broadswords and spears to fight against artillery and machine guns. Finally, the enemy dared not come and go freely in such a blatant manner." This is why the armed struggle of the people of Dian-Gui-Qian burned like a prairie fire. In April 1949, more than 1,000 militiamen from Qiubei County cooperated with the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column in combat, repelling enemies several times their number. In the same month, more than 3,000 ethnic minority rifles in the Xishan area ambushed the enemy reinforcing Mile on the Yugu Ban line, annihilating more than 300 enemies. In July, the Luoping County militia again defeated the invasion of three regiments of the bandit 26th Army...

    The spring that the people of Yunnan longed for in battle finally arrived. Around the Spring Festival of 1950, when General Chen Geng's troops entered Yunnan from Guizhou, the crowds welcoming them stretched for thousands of miles. People raised their hands and cheered heartily. Women farmers in the Longhai Mountain area rushed to Luliang County to welcome the People's Liberation Army during the New Year. The enthusiasm of ethnic minority compatriots in welcoming the People's Liberation Army was even harder to describe. The Yi and Sani compatriots played their own musical instruments, singing "The East is Red, the Sun Rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong..." People of all ethnic groups, such as the Sha, Luo, and Miao in southeastern Yunnan, traveled from hundreds of li away, crossed mountains and ridges, and carried grain to the roadside to send to the troops. They sadly and happily recounted their past miserable experiences to their own soldiers. In the past, it was "Peach Blossom March 3rd, the Miao people move their homes," and they were driven out by the Kuomintang bandit gang with bayonets, forced to flee to deep mountains and valleys. Now they have free land.

    IV. Mountains and Rivers Remain the Same, but the Scenery is Brand New

    When bandit chiefs Li Mi and Yu Chengwan attempted to counterattack Kunming, the people of Kunming, who had already stood up, used battle to defend their city. They would not allow the bloody rule of the reactionaries to stain this free city again.

    On December 18th, when the first Kuomintang bandit artillery shell that counterattacked Kunming streaked across the silent sky and landed in the city, the people of Kunming armed themselves. The workers of the 53rd Arsenal immediately organized 500 men with guns. The workers of the Central Machine Factory took up hammers and iron bars to guard the machines. The Kunming Power Plant built sandbags and made necessary preparations. Under the call of the Student Union, students in Kunming, who had a glorious tradition of struggle, held a 10,000-person demonstration. Under the leadership of the workers, students, farmers, teenage girls, professors in their sixties, and all freedom-loving people competed to join their own organized armed force - the Volunteer Self-Defense Force. They carried live ammunition, and those without guns built fortifications and performed combat service duties. This armed force braved the dense rain of bullets and assisted the uprising troops in resisting the bandit troops. Finally, the day of victory arrived, and the people of Kunming bravely cooperated with the People's Liberation Army entering Yunnan to defeat the reactionaries.

    The people of Kunming welcomed their own troops with unprecedented excitement. On February 23rd, at the Yunnan All Circles Welcome the People's Liberation Army to Kunming Conference, the workers of the 53rd Arsenal specially rushed to make 200 brand-new light machine guns and presented them to the People's Liberation Army. They wrote on the banner: "Support you, liberate Taiwan, liberate all of China."

    From then on, the people of Yunnan began peaceful labor. People are using diligent hands to heal the wounds of war and the devastation of life. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which was severely damaged by the bandit troops, has resumed traffic. Seventy percent of the province's highways, urban water and electricity, postal services, and the textile industry have begun to recover. Farmers and ethnic minority compatriots are preparing to reclaim wasteland and increase production. Intellectuals are enthusiastically learning revolutionary knowledge. From cities to villages, everywhere is full of new life.

　　云南的春天
    郭奕　展潮
    一、红旗飘扬在五华山上
    一九五○年三月四日，在云南是一个划时代的日子——中国人民解放军昆明市军事管制委员会成立了，它宣告了人民大众正式成为这座美丽名城的主人。
    这一天，昆明的天空分外蔚蓝。一面红色的五星旗，在五华山上迎风招展。这面旗是云南人民长期奋斗换取来的。它在去年冬天第一次出现在昆明市的时候，曾经鼓舞了无数人的心。那是十二月十日的早晨。在席卷大西南的革命风暴中，卢汉将军顺应了云南一千三百万各族人民的意愿，宣布脱离国民党反动政府，接受中央人民政府的领导，云南从此宣告和平解放。同一月里，人民解放大军数十万雄师分路兼程入滇，与滇桂黔边区纵队及云南人民结合在一起，粉碎了残余匪军二十六军和第八军的反扑，并将其全歼于滇南，使云南全省获得解放。今年二月二十日，陈赓、宋任穷两将军率领人民解放军进驻昆明，并着手建立人民民主专政的政权，云南人民的命运，从此掌握在自己的手里了，一个崭新的云南诞生了。这一连串重大的历史事件，恰恰发生在严冬消逝、新春到来的季节，人们抚摸着遍体创伤，凝视着猎猎飘动的红旗，第一次感到：春天真正来到了。
    二、历史的大会师
    在滇南千山万水间所进行的对匪军第二十六军和第八军的围歼战中，人民解放军入滇作战部队和坚持敌后解放战争的滇桂黔边区纵队会师了。这是人们多么想望的一个日子。当我们在广东前线作战时，听到了人民解放军滇桂边区纵队迅速发展壮大的消息，曾经有力地鼓舞了我们前进的决心。同样，当我们横渡长江的消息传到了云南时，我们的弟兄同敌后的人民也曾为此兴奋得落下了眼泪。盼望的日子终于来了，一月二日，人民解放军从广西百色地区奉命入滇，滇桂黔边区纵队的同志们用最大的力量来支援。他们连夜赶了二百多里山路，在滇桂边界用石块木料建立了四十多座桥梁，他们从百里外把食米一袋一袋地运到大道边。把每餐一斤的食米减到十二两，节省下来供给兄弟部队。
    当两支部队在滇桂交界线上见面时，人民解放军指战员们，看到自己的阶级兄弟在这冰霜季节还穿着单衣，衣服破了露出肉体，脚上没有穿鞋时，感动得落泪了。战士们急忙脱下身上的衣服，送给在敌后坚持斗争的弟兄。
    滇桂黔边区纵队是在艰苦中发展壮大起来的。一九四八年四月，滇东南圭山地区人民在中国共产党领导下发动了武装起义，树起了云南人民战斗的红旗。他们进行了殊死的战斗，粉碎了敌人一个团的进攻，向南横渡盘江，在滇越边境上和桂滇边区纵队（两广纵队的一部分）胜利会师，在丛林瘴气，物资医药都极端缺乏的困难条件下进行了整训。一九四八年十月，他们奉命北上，先后翻过高达三千公尺的勾漏山脉、六诏山脉，冲破了敌区封锁，在烈日、大雨中连续行军十四昼夜，歼灭了敢于阻止他们前进的一切敌人，顺利完成了开辟滇东南根据地的任务。一年内他们壮大了十倍，解放了三十一座县城（至一九四九年八月为止）和四百多万人口为解放云南开辟了顺利的道路。今天，他们已与兄弟部队携起手来向残余的敌人进行围歼了。
    去年十二月，人民解放军东路入滇部队击溃了国民党残匪向昆明的反扑。人民解放军南路入滇部队则在一月二日由广西百色地区进入滇境，他们在人民解放军第四野战军和滇桂黔边区纵队的配合下，歼灭了国民党残匪第八军、第二十六军等部三万多人。在这一战役行动中，人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员们在三十天当中攀山涉水，通过瘴疠地带，前进两千多里，进行了日以继夜的追击战斗，创造了稀有的艰苦进军的范例。
    三、千里高原，同仇敌忾
    云南农民在这几千里的交通线上，用了最大的力量支援二十万军队的进军和作战。滇东南五万人口的富宁县，是一个极其贫困的县份，但他们仅仅用二十多天的时间，便筹集了八十万斤粮食，支援了十万大军过境西进，追歼匪军。滇东罗平县的农民为了迎接自己的军队，在前几个月就喂下了鸡，种下了菜。鸡渐渐大起来，菜渐渐长起来，他们又卖掉了鸡蛋和菜蔬，换回果类保存起来，等待着队伍来。
    云南农民从长期的灾难生活里，体会到了人民解放战争的彻底胜利，和他们的命运已联系在一起。陆良县牛头山区的农民们给解放军的慰问信里控诉国民党匪军的罪行说：“我们永远记得在西华寺活埋的卖面的父子两人和被活剥皮的两个庄稼人，在红金寨烧毁的惨状，在三岔河一带挨家挨户被抄的情景，在垢甸五个老百姓被砍了头，在另一个地方匪军放假一星期的大奸淫……在那个黑暗的时候，路上没有行人，市上没有交易，家里断了炊烟，村里没有鸡鸣。”日子不能继续过下去，他们起来反抗了。信上说：“我们在共产党领导之下组织起来了，用正义对抗强暴，用大刀长矛等原始武器对抗大炮机枪。终于，敌人不敢再明目张胆地来去自如了。”这就是滇桂黔人民的武装斗争像燎原之火一样地燃烧起来的原因。一九四九年四月间，邱北县民兵一千多人配合滇桂黔边区纵队作战，击退了数倍于己的敌人。同月，西山区的少数民族三千多支民枪，在弥勒玉鼓坂一线上伏击向弥勒增援的敌人，歼敌三百多。七月，罗平县民兵又击溃了匪二十六军三个团的进犯……。
    云南人民在战斗中想望着的春天终于来了。当一九五○年春节前后，陈赓将军的部队由黔入滇时，千里路上为欢迎的人群连结了起来。人们高举双手，尽情欢呼。龙海山区的农民妇女们在过年期间赶到陆良县城迎接解放军。少数民族同胞迎接解放军的热情更是难以描画的。彝族、撒尼同胞，用他们自己的乐器，尽情的吹奏着“东方红，太阳升，中国出了一个毛泽东……。”滇东南的沙族、倮族、苗族等各族人民远从百里之外，翻过丛山峻岭，把粮食背到大路边送给部队。他们和自己的子弟兵悲喜交集的叙述着过去的悲惨境遇。从前是“桃花三月三，苗人把家搬”，他们被国民党匪帮用刺刀驱逐，被迫逃向深山绝谷。现在他们才有了自由的土地。
    四、山河依旧，景象全新
    当李弥、余程万诸匪企图反扑昆明的时候，已经站起来的昆明人民用战斗来保卫自己的城市。他们不容许反动派的血腥统治再来沾污这个自由的城市。
    十二月十八日，当国民党匪军反扑昆明的第一颗炮弹划过寂静的天空落到市区时，昆明人民武装起来了。五十三兵工厂的职工一下就组织起五百人枪。中央机器厂的职工拿起铁锤、铁棍，守卫着机器。昆明电厂垒起了沙包，做了应有的准备。有着光荣斗争传统的昆明学生，在学联号召之下，举行了万人的示威游行。在工人带头之下，学生、农民、十几岁的女孩子、六十多岁的教授，一切爱好自由的人民，都争着参加自己组织起来的武装——义勇自卫队。他们荷枪实弹，没有枪的就修筑工事，担任战斗勤务。这支武装冒着炽密的弹雨，协助起义部队抗击匪军。终于，胜利的日子来到了，昆明人民勇敢地配合入滇作战的人民解放军，把反动派击败了。
    昆明人民以从所未有的昂奋情绪迎接自己的部队。二月二十三日。在云南各界欢迎人民解放军莅昆大会上，五十三兵工厂的工人特别赶制了二百挺崭新的轻机枪献给解放军。他们在旗帜上写着：“支援你们，解放台湾，解放全中国。”
    从此，云南人民开始了和平的劳动。人们正用勤劳的双手医治战争的创伤和凋敝的生活。被匪军残重破坏的滇越铁路恢复通车了，全省百分之七十的公路、城市的水电、邮政和纺织业开始恢复了。农民们和少数民族同胞们正在准备开垦荒地，增加生产。知识分子们热烈学习着革命知识，从城市到乡村，到处充满新生气象。
