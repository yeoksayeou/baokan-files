    Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
    On March 12th, the Soviet people victoriously held the second post-war election of the highest organ of power in the socialist state—the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, unanimously voting to support the long-tested candidates nominated by the alliance of party members and non-party members. In this election, more than 111 million voters went to the polls. In history, no party other than the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and no government other than the Soviet government, has ever received such unanimous support and such concentrated votes of confidence from the entire people. The Soviet people have re-elected Marshal Stalin and his close comrades-in-arms, the most outstanding representatives of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, to the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and have once again given them great trust and power to continue to lead the Soviet people in their struggle to build a communist society and to lead the people of the world in their struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy.
    The victorious outcome of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR will undoubtedly guarantee the Soviet Union's rapid progress towards new victories in building a communist society, and will guarantee that the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, organized on an international scale, will more forcefully strike at the aggressive forces of imperialism.

    苏联最高苏维埃选举
    苏联人民已经在三月十二日胜利地举行了社会主义国家最高权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃的战后第二次大选，一致投票拥护党与非党联盟所提出的久经考验的候选人。此次选举，前往投票的选民，达一亿一千一百万以上。在历史上，除了苏联共产党以外再没有任何党派，除了苏联政府以外，再没有任何政府，曾获得全体人民这样一致的支持，这样集中的信任票。苏联人民把斯大林大元帅和他的亲密战友们，把工人、集体农民和知识分子的最优秀的代表们，再度选入了苏联最高苏维埃的联盟院和民族院，再度给予巨大信任和权力，使他们继续为领导苏联人民建设共产主义社会而斗争，为领导全世界人民争取持久和平与人民民主而斗争。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举的胜利结果，无疑将保证苏联迅速走向建设共产主义社会的新胜利，保证在国际规模上组织起来的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，将更为有力地打击帝国主义的侵略力量。
