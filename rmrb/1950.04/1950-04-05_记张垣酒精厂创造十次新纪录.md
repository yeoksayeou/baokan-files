　　Records of Ten New Records Created by Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory
　　Zhang Yi
　　The Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory, under the Industrial Department of the People's Government of Chahar Province, has created ten consecutive new records from mid-January to March 24 this year after launching a new record-breaking campaign. The average monthly output and product rate have increased significantly, while costs have been greatly reduced. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule in 1948, the average product rate was 19.49%. By December of last year, the average product rate had increased to 23.35%. After the launch of the new record-breaking campaign, the average product rate in January increased to 24.32%; in February, it continued to increase to 25.05%; and by March 24, it had reached 26%. The highest daily output rate was 28.37%. Due to the increase in the product rate, the production volume also increased with the same manpower and equipment. Taking the output in February this year as an example, it increased by 275% compared with the average monthly output of 11,348 jin in 1948. Therefore, the cost was greatly reduced.
　　Before October last year, the Party, government, and labor union of the factory were not united, and were caught in unprincipled disputes all day long, which relaxed the leadership of production. After October, the leading cadres of the factory were adjusted, the branch work was criticized by the Municipal Party Committee, and a review was conducted; the trade union work also strictly criticized the error of one-sided welfare views, and from then on began to clarify the idea of "production first." After Director Chen Zongde returned from visiting Dalian, his working attitude improved significantly. He often went to the workshop to check the work. Once, when an accident occurred in the distillation tower, he personally helped the workers to repair it. At the end of last year, the Party conducted model evaluation work. Li Peichang, an old technical worker who had always been active in production but had never been valued, was selected as a model party member and was respected by all parties. Many workers wanted to learn from him, so the policy of "production first" was further implemented among Party members and the masses. The trade union also conducted re-election in late December last year. Under the guidance of the policy of "the trade union facing production," the trade union cadres not only went deep into the workshop to learn technology and lead production, but also took the initiative to lead workers to formulate production plans to ensure the realization of administrative production tasks. For example, after the management committee approved the task of producing 21,000 jin of alcohol in January, the trade union immediately convened a mobilization meeting, and then the groups launched discussions, put forward supplementary opinions, and formulated workshop plans, realizing the slogan of increasing output without increasing personnel. Due to the strengthening of the trade union work, the task of producing 83,000 jin of alcohol in the first quarter was completed ahead of schedule by 21:50 on March 25, exceeding the task by 30 jin, and the product quality met the specifications.
　　The factory is a chemical processing and manufacturing industry, and the production process is extremely complicated. From Qu seed cultivation to finished products, it has to go through nine main processes: yeast cultivation, Qu making, cooking, saccharification, lactic acid cultivation, mother liquor cultivation, fermentation, and distillation. The semi-finished products in each process are composed of many factors. However, the factory lacks various scientific measuring instruments, and the machinery and equipment are extremely backward, and some have exceeded their service life. Under such conditions, the factory leaders relied on the workers' careful operation and created four new records. For example, there is no regulator in the distillation room, so the workers repeatedly turn the tile wheel by hand to set the standard. After careful operation, they have gradually developed a set of experience, so the loss has been reduced and the product rate has risen sharply. With the development of the new record-breaking movement, the labor organization has been rationally improved. Taking the distillation workshop as an example, in the past, five workers were divided into two groups (two on the day shift and three on the night shift) to take turns. It was difficult to assess how much alcohol each shift produced. After the management committee and the administration put forward an improvement plan, and after the workers' discussion and research, it was decided to add one person to the distillation workshop, and fix the number of personnel in each group to three, and no longer rotate shifts. The production results of each shift were announced, and production was increased under mutual competition.
　　Establishing and improving various systems is also one of the reasons for consolidating and promoting the new record-breaking movement. In the two and a half months of the new record-breaking movement, the factory gradually established the workshop "responsibility system" and "shift handover system"; in terms of engineering management, it established the "engineering daily record system," improved the "general affairs daily record system," "engineering daily report system," "mechanical responsibility system," "engineering attendance" and factory regulations. For example, the "engineering daily record system" stipulates that engineering management should check the quantity and quality of semi-finished products produced in each process, the operating time of each workshop, the temperature of the Qu room and fermentation room, the work distribution, and the problems that occur. It also stipulates daily inspections: Qu room twice, saccharification workshop five times, fermentation room twice, distillation workshop twice. This urges the responsibility of the engineering and technical personnel and facilitates timely discovery and solution of problems. At the same time, due to the establishment and improvement of various systems, it is convenient for performance assessment, which can not only give play to production enthusiasm, but also facilitate checking accident responsibility, thus ensuring the straight upward trend of the product rate.
　　The factory's propaganda and mobilization work is closely integrated with the production movement, which effectively encourages the workers' production enthusiasm and promotes production. The factory often uses various and flexible methods such as good news reports, blackboard newspapers, photography, writing newsletters for newspapers and broadcasting to commend production achievements and advanced workers in a timely manner, which greatly strengthens the workers' production enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. In the forty-nine days from January 16 to March 5, ten new records were created continuously.

　　记张垣酒精厂创造十次新纪录
    张毅
    察哈尔省人民政府工业厅所属张家口酒精厂，从今年一月中旬开展创新纪录运动后，到三月二十四日止，连续创造了十次新纪录，每月平均产量及产品率显著提高，成本则大大降低。一九四八年国民党反动统治时期，平均产品率为百分之十九点四九。去年十二月平均产品率已增为百分之二十三点三五。创新纪录运动开展后，一月份平均产品率即增为百分之二十四点三二；二月份继增到百分之二十五点零五；三月份到二十四日止，已达百分之二十六。其中最高日产率为百分之二十八点三七。由于产品率的提高，在人工与机器设备不变的情况下，生产量也随之提高。以今年二月份产量为例，则较一九四八年每月平均产量一万一千三百四十八市斤增加百分之二百七十五。因此成本大大降低。
    该厂在去年十月以前，党、政、工互不团结，终日陷于无原则的纠纷，放松了生产的领导。十月以后，该厂领导干部经过调整，支部工作受到市委的批评，并进行了检讨；工会工作也严格批判了片面福利观点的错误，从此开始明确了“生产第一”的思想。陈宗德厂长从大连参观回来后，工作态度有了显著的改进，经常到车间去检查工作，有一次正当蒸溜塔发生事故，他便亲自帮助工人修理。去年年终党内进行评模工作，一贯生产积极但从不被人重视的老技术工人李培昌，被选为模范党员，受到各方面的尊重，很多工人都要向他学习，因此把“生产第一”的方针进一步贯彻到党员和群众中去。工会并于去年十二月下旬进行了改选，在“工会面向生产”的方针指导下，工会干部除深入车间，学习技术，领导生产外，并主动的领导工人订生产计划，以保证行政生产任务的实现。如管委会通过一月份生产二万一千斤酒精任务后，工会立即召开动员大会，接着各小组展开讨论，提出了补充意见，并制定了车间计划，实现了增加产量不增人的口号。由于工会工作的加强，第一季生产酒精八万三千斤的任务，至三月二十五日二十一时五十分钟止，即提前完成任务，并超过三十斤，产品质量合乎规格标准。
    该厂为化学加工制造业，生产过程极为复杂。从麹种培养到出成品要经过酵母培养、制麹、蒸煮、糖化、乳酸培养、酒母培养、发酵、蒸馏九个主要过程，而制成每个过程中的半成品，又有多种因素构成。但该厂缺乏各种科学的测量器具，机器设备极为落后，有的且已超过使用寿命。在这样条件下，该厂领导上依靠工人精心操作，曾创造了四次新纪录。比如蒸馏室没有调节器，工人们就用手反复转动瓦轮定标准。经过精心操作已逐渐摸索出一套经验，所以减少了耗损，使产品率直线上升。随着创新纪录运动的开展，又合理地改进劳动组织。以蒸馏车间为例，过去五个工人分为二组（白班二人，夜班三人）轮流倒换，那班出酒多少难以考核。经管委会及行政提出改进计划，又经工人们的讨论研究，决定蒸馏车间增加一人，固定每组人员为三人，不再轮流替换班，并将每班生产成绩公布，在互相竞赛下，提高生产。
    建立与健全各种制度，也是巩固与促进创新纪录运动的原因之一。该厂在两个半月的创新纪录运动中，逐步建立了车间“专责制”，“交班制”；工务管理上建立了“工务日录制”，健全了“总务日录制”、“工务日报制”、“机械专责制”、“工务考勤”及厂规等。例如“工务日录制”规定：工务管理上要检查各工序所产之半成品数量及质量，各车间操作时间，麹室、发酵室温度，工作分配情形；发生问题等。并规定了每日检查：麹房二次，糖化车间五次，发酵室二次，蒸馏车间二次。这样便督促了工务技术人员的责任心便于及时发现问题与解决问题。同时也由于各种制度的建立和健全，便于成绩考核，既可发挥生产积极性，又便于检查事故责任，因此保证了产品率的直线上升。
    该厂的宣传鼓动工作密切与生产运动相结合，有力的鼓舞了工人生产情绪，推进了生产。该厂经常以喜报、黑板报、照像，为报纸写通讯报导、广播等多样灵活的方式，及时表扬生产成绩和先进，大大加强了工人的生产积极性和责任心，在一月十六至三月五日的四十九天中，连续创造十次新纪录。
