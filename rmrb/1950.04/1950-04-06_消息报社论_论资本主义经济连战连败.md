Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: *Izvestia* published an editorial entitled "On the Continuous Defeats of the Capitalist Economy," stating: The national economy of the victorious socialist countries is in the midst of a magnificent new upsurge. The people's democratic countries that have embarked on the road of socialist construction have clearly and convincingly recognized the benefits of a planned economy free from the incurable diseases of capitalism, and are developing their economies with full confidence. Economic progress is the law of the entire growing socialist and democratic camp.

However, the situation in the imperialist camp is vastly different. In the imperialist camp, economic crises are increasingly felt, unemployment is increasing, production is shrinking, large quantities of materials are being destroyed, and productive forces are being criminally wasted on preparing for a new world war.

*Izvestia* cited specific facts and figures to demonstrate the decline in production in major capitalist countries, including the United States, and to demonstrate the plight of Marshall Plan countries. The newspaper emphasized that imperialism has never brought such severe pain and sorrow to the working people as it does today. By the beginning of 1950, there were approximately 45 million unemployed or partially unemployed people in all capitalist countries. The profits of the largest monopolists in Britain, France, and especially the United States, juxtaposed with the difficulties and increasing poverty of the working people in various capitalist countries, are truly shocking. American capitalists, obsessed with the insane scheme of "Americanizing" all countries and all continents, are desperately trying to set foot in every "accessible" corner of the globe. The plans of American monopolists call for using coercion and war to establish an American world empire. This is being done under the guise of "aid" and "protection."

*Izvestia* emphasized that it is becoming increasingly difficult to deceive the people with high-sounding words and to degrade them into docile slaves of American monopolists. The masses of the world know that there is a bright new world—the socialist world—in which the working people have freed themselves from the shackles of exploitation, unemployment, and poverty, and are living a happy and joyful life.

The capitalist system is crumbling in its center—the metropolitan countries—and in its peripheral colonies. Capitalism, in its historical competition with socialism, is suffering continuous defeats and is increasingly trapped in the net of its inherent contradictions. The leaders of the capitalist world want to turn back the clock of history, but this is not up to them. Despite whatever desperate plans they may devise, the historical development of mankind knows only one path—advancing towards communism.

    论资本主义经济连战连败
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：消息报以“资本主义经济连战连败”为题发表社论称：胜利的社会主义国家的国民经济，正处在气势磅礴的新高潮中。已走上建设社会主义之道路的人民民主国家，已经很明确地信服摆脱了资本主义不治之症的计划经济的好处，并满怀信心地发展着它们的经济。经济进展是整个日益壮大的社会主义与民主阵营的规律。
    然而，帝国主义阵营的情景却与此有天渊之别。在帝国主义阵营中，经济危机越来越使人感受到了失业正在增加，生产正在减缩，大批物资被破坏了，生产力正被罪恶地浪费在准备新世界战争上。
    消息报援引具体事实与数字，证明包括美国在内的主要的资本主义国家的生产低落，并证明马歇尔化国家的困境。该报着重指出：帝国主义从来没有像今天那样，给劳动人民带来了这么厉害的痛苦与哀伤。至一九五○年年初，在全部资本主义国家里约有四千五百万人失业或半失业。英国、法国尤其是美国最大垄断资本家的利润，衬托着各资本主义国家劳动人民处境的困难和日益厉害的贫穷，实在是令人触目惊心的。美国资本家对“美国化”一切国家一切大陆这一疯狂计谋着了迷，拚命企图插足地球上一切“人迹可达”的角落。美国垄断资本家的计划，要求利用威迫与战争来建立美国人的世界帝国。这是在“援助”与“保护”这些腐朽的口号掩饰之下进行的。
    消息报强调说：然而，要用冠冕堂皇的辞汇来愚弄人民，并要把他们贬降到美国独占资本家柔顺的奴隶的地位，是越来越困难了。全世界的大众都晓得：有一个光明的新世界——社会主义世界，在这个世界里，劳动人民已摆脱了剥削、失业与贫穷的枷锁，过着幸福而愉快的生活。
    资本主义制度在其中心——宗主国及其外围的殖民地都摇摇欲坠了。资本主义在与社会主义的历史性竞赛中连战连败，已越来越深地陷在它自身所固有的矛盾的罗网中了。资本主义世界的头目们想使历史倒退，然而，这却不能由他们作主。尽管他们会筹划怎样孤注一掷的计划，然而，人类的历史发展却只晓得一条路——向共产主义迈进。
