Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　The resolutions concerning the unification of the National Xinhua Bookstore, passed at the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference held last October, have now been revised by the Central People's Government Publishing Administration based on actual circumstances and approved by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government. The decision is as follows:

            I. Guiding Principles

    The National Xinhua Bookstore must rapidly move towards unification and centralization, strengthen specialization and enterprise management, in order to undertake the country's publishing tasks and develop the people's publishing cause.

    The focus of publishing content should be: (1) textbooks and teaching materials for all levels of schools; (2) various translations of works on Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought; (3) works needed for national economic construction and cultural construction; (4) popular reading materials for workers and peasants.

    Distribution work should focus on cities and continue to penetrate rural areas.

            II. Leadership and Organization

    (1) A General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore will be established in Beijing, as an enterprise organization affiliated with the Central People's Government Publishing Administration and directly under the leadership of the Publishing Bureau of the Publishing Administration. The business of Xinhua Bookstores throughout the country will be under the leadership of the General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore.

    (2) The National Xinhua Bookstore will initially operate according to the principle of centralized leadership and decentralized management, and gradually move towards unified operation. General branches of Xinhua Bookstore will be established in major administrative regions (North China, East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Central South China, South China, Southwest China) and will be directly under the leadership of the General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore. The Publishing Bureau of the Publishing Administration may issue instructions or announcements to the general branches of Xinhua Bookstore on matters of principle concerning relevant policies.

    (3) Branches will be established under the general branches of Xinhua Bookstore. In principle, only one branch will be established in each province, but provinces with vast areas may establish more according to actual circumstances. Branches will be located in provincial capitals or large cities with convenient transportation. Sub-branches will be established below the branch level, located in cities, counties, or important market towns under the jurisdiction of the province. Each general branch should also establish and develop military bookstores where possible, so that each field army and military region has a military bookstore.

    (4) The General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore will establish three departments: Publishing, Factory Affairs, and Distribution, as three specialized units. Each general branch should also establish these three specialized departments (editorial work can establish an organization parallel to these three departments, or belong to the publishing department). Generally, branches and sub-branches only conduct distribution business, but branches may also establish editorial and publishing organizations if needed and capable.

    (5) Xinhua Bookstores at all levels should periodically submit various business and comprehensive work reports to higher-level organizations. Each general branch should accept the unified regulations and adjustments of the General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore in terms of editorial work, publishing, printing, distribution tasks, and related material conditions.

    (6) The General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore may uniformly dispatch staff members of Xinhua Bookstores at all levels and their affiliated organizations. The appointment and removal of managers at the general branch level should be approved by the Publishing Bureau.

            III. Steps for Unification and Centralization

    (1) Before the end of June 1950, each general branch will divide the publishing, factory affairs, and distribution departments into three independent economic units. (Accounting is separate and independent; the expenses of the management department and editorial department of the general branch are paid by the publishing department.)

    (2) Before the end of September 1950, all Xinhua Bookstore branches and sub-branches in various regions will be completely unified and centralized (including funds) in the general branch of that region.

    (3) Before the end of December 1950, the funds of each general branch will be completely centralized under the General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore, becoming a unified national enterprise organization.

    (4) The timeframes for the above steps may be postponed in the Southwest and South China, depending on the situation.

　　政务院文教委员会批准
    统一全国新华书店决定     
    加强专业化、企业化，担任国家出版任务。
    【新华社讯】去年十月召开的全国新华书店出版工作会议所通过的有关统一全国新华书店的各项决议，现由中央人民政府出版总署根据实际情形加以修正，并经中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会批准。该项决定如下：
            一  方针
    全国新华书店必须迅速走向统一、集中，加强专业化、企业化，以担任国家的出版任务，发展人民的出版事业。
    出版内容应着重：（一）各级学校教科用书；（二）关于马克思、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的各种译著；（三）为国家经济建设、文化建设所需要的著作；（四）工农通俗读物。
    发行工作应以城市为重点，继续深入农村。
            二  领导和组织
    （一）在北京建立新华书店总管理处，为隶属于中央人民政府出版总署，受出版总署出版局直接领导之企业机构。全国各地新华书店的业务均归新华书店总管理处领导。
    （二）全国新华书店首先根据集中领导、分散经营的原则进行工作，逐步走向统一经营。在全国各大行政区（华北、华东、东北、西北、中南、华南、西南）设新华书店总分店直接受新华书店总管理处领导。出版总署出版局得在有关方针政策的原则性问题上，向新华书店各总分店发出指示或通告。
    （三）在新华书店总分店下设分店，原则上一省只设分店一处，但地区辽阔省份得按实际情形增设之。分店设于省会或交通方便之大城市。分店以下设支店，设于省属市、县或重要集镇。各总分店并应在可能条件下建立并发展随军书店，做到各野战军及各军区，均有随军书店。
    （四）新华书店总管理处设出版、厂务、发行三个部门，为三个专业化单元。各总分店亦应分别设立这三个专业部门（编辑工作可设立与此三部门相平行之机构，或属于出版部门），分支店一般的都只是做发行业务，但分店如有需要和力量也可设编审出版机构。
    （五）各级新华书店应定期向上级机构做各种业务的及综合的工作报告，各总分店在编辑工作和出版印刷发行任务及其有关物质条件上应接受新华书店总管理处之统一规定和调剂。
    （六）新华书店总管理处得统一调度各级新华书店及其所属机构之工作人员。各总分店经理一级人员之任免应经出版局之批准。
            三  统一集中的步骤
    （一）一九五○年六月底前各总分店将出版、厂务、发行三部门划分为三个独立的经济单元。（会计各别独立、总分店管理部门及编审部门的费用归出版部门开支。）
    （二）一九五○年九月底以前，各地新华书店分店、支店完全统一集中（包括资金）于各该地区之总分店。
    （三）一九五○年十二月底以前，各总分店的资金完全集中在新华书店总管理处之下，成为全国统一的企业机构。
    （四）以上步骤之时间规定，在西南与华南，得视情况推延之。
