　　Match Supply Exceeds Demand, Production and Sales Imbalance
    Ministry of Light Industry Working to Resolve

    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] The Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry is planning to take appropriate steps to ensure that the national match industry's production is planned in order to overcome the current imbalance between match production and sales. It is reported that recently, the North China match industry has been suffering severely from losses due to sluggish sales, high costs, and selling prices that do not cover costs. Of the fourteen match factories in Beijing, six have successively shut down, two of which have already gone bankrupt; of the seventeen privately-owned match factories in Tianjin, nine have been shut down, and another three are preparing to suspend operations and switch to other industries. The reason for this phenomenon is the overly rapid development of the North China match industry after liberation. Currently, Tianjin's monthly match production is more than 8,000 cases, exceeding its average monthly production in previous years: Beijing's match production has doubled compared to before liberation. Recently, Northeast China matches have been promoted and sold in the interior, and match industries in various places have also resumed production one after another, resulting in an oversupply of match production in the entire North China region. According to pre-war national annual match production of about one million cases, current known production statistics from various regions already exceed 90,000 cases per month, and the actual production is estimated to be even higher. As for the national match production capacity, according to incomplete statistics of machinery and equipment, it is estimated that at least 1.5 million cases can be produced. However, the people's purchasing power is not as high as before the war, so there is excess match production equipment nationwide. For example, although five factories in the Shanghai match industry have closed and seven have relocated in the past year, the existing eight factories still have a monthly production capacity of 20,000 cases, while the actual production is only about 5,000 cases. Match factories in the Southwest region have also mostly suspended operations due to sluggish sales, but at the same time, many regions are still preparing to establish new match factories or are vying to resume expansion. On the one hand, sales are stagnant, and prices are being lowered to seek sales; on the other hand, there is still blind investment in expansion and increased production, which will inevitably further promote the contradiction of match flooding and oversupply in various places, increasing the crisis of the entire match industry. In response to this situation, the Central Ministry of Light Industry is preparing to convene a match industry conference in May to discuss methods for coordinating match production and sales and formulating a national match production plan.

### 火柴供过于求产销失调  轻工业部正力谋解决

　　火柴供过于求产销失调
    轻工业部正力谋解决
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府轻工业部正拟采取适当步骤，使全国火柴工业生产具有计划性，以克服目前火柴生产中的产销失调现象。据悉，最近华北火柴工业因销路呆滞、成本过高、售价不敷成本，亏损情形颇为严重。北京火柴厂十四家中，已陆续有六厂停工，其中已有两家倒闭；天津十七家私营火柴厂中，停闭者已有九家，另三家亦准备停工转业。产生此种现象的原因，为解放后华北火柴业发展过速。目前天津火柴月产量为八千余箱，已超过其历年平均月产量：北京火柴产量则较解放前增加了一倍。近来东北火柴入关内推销，各地火柴工业亦纷纷恢复生产，致整个华北区火柴生产已有过剩现象。按战前全国年产火柴约在一百万箱左右，目前就已知各地产量统计，每月已在九万箱以上，实际产量估计尚不止此。至于全国火柴生产能力，根据不完整的机器设备统计数字推算，至少可产一百五十万箱以上。但目前民间之购买力尚不及战前，故全国范围内火柴生产设备已有过剩。如上海火柴业一年来虽有五厂停闭、七厂内迁，现存八厂的月产能力仍达二万箱，而现在实际产量仅五千箱左右。西南区火柴厂亦因销路不振，大部停工，但同时甚多地区火柴工厂仍有筹备新设，或争先恢复扩充者。一面销路停滞，贬价求售；一面则仍盲目投资，扩充增产，其结果势将更促成各地火柴充斥，供过于求的矛盾现象，增重整个火柴工业之危机。中央轻工业部针对此种情况，已准备于五月间召开火柴工业会议，商讨火柴产销协调办法及拟订全国火柴生产计划。
