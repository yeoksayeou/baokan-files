　　Editor's Note: After this publication ran three articles in the 41st issue criticizing errors in the translation of Soviet novels, we received a letter from Chaofeng Publishing House. The company expressed its acceptance of the criticism of its published translation of "How the Steel Was Tempered" and decided to re-translate the novel. We believe this attitude is very good. We are now publishing the company's letter below. In addition, we received a letter from Mr. Yijian, who pointed out that in Ling Yin's critique of Wang Zhonghuan's translation of "Sagan's Spring," Ling Yin's revised translation also contained errors and ambiguities. After forwarding the original letter to Comrade Ling Yin for review, he believed that this point was necessary and correct. Comrade Ling Yin's letter is also published below:

　　Letter from Chaofeng Publishing House to the Editors:

　　We have read Mr. Zhu Ziping's article in the People's Literature and Art column of your newspaper's 41st issue on March 26, criticizing the errors in the translation of the new complete translation of "How the Steel Was Tempered" by Mr. Feng Zou, published by our company. We believe that we should not only humbly accept it but also solemnly thank you.

　　Recalling the first translation of the book, which was published as far back as 1937, it was a re-translation from the Japanese version by Mr. Duan Luofu and Mr. Chen Feihuang. At that time, readers and our company felt that the translation of the book was imperfect, but it did not lose the original meaning. At that time, no one was doing this work, and the need for the book was very urgent. Under these circumstances, our company rashly published it. However, from the standpoint of our company's publishing work, it would be contrary to our company's consistent serious stance on publishing work to publish important books of revolutionary literature with imperfect translations for a long time without correcting them. Therefore, in 1948, we rekindled our courage and asked Mr. Feng Zou to re-translate it into a completely new translation, and destroyed all the imperfect old translations (and we also clearly stated this in the copyright notice) to show our responsible attitude towards readers.

　　Mr. Feng Zou translated based on the English version, and the proofreaders proofread based on the Chinese original manuscript, without proofreading from the original text. This is the common process for publishing books in the general publishing industry. As for our insufficient understanding of the translation, we should be directly and indirectly responsible to the readers, and we absolutely do not want to evade our responsibility in publishing work. However, we hope that readers will forgive us for being young, we are still learning, and we are seeking progress in our work.

　　After self-examination by our company, we are willing to sincerely accept public opinion and decide to express our company's work attitude with action. From today, our company will stop reprinting this translation and ask Mr. He Jin and Mr. Sun Zhaokun to re-translate it thoroughly based on the latest (1948) Russian original text to complete the serious task of introducing world-famous literary works. We hereby inform you and hope that you will give us advice to correct our shortcomings. With best regards.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chaofeng Publishing House Sincerely,

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　April 2, 1950.

　　Letter from Comrade Ling Yin to the Editors of "People's Literature and Art":

　　I have carefully read the opinions of Mr. Yijian of Tianjin on my article criticizing Wang Zhonghuan's translation of "Sagan's Spring" in the 41st issue of People's Literature and Art on March 26. Mr. Yijian's opinion is correct. He agreed with criticizing Wang's translation and at the same time pointed out that I also made mistakes in my criticism. He encouraged and educated me.

　　The mistake that Mr. Yijian pointed out was the second point in my article that criticized the errors in Wang's translation. Wang's translation was: "At the end of the 1890s, Sagan was only included in the national documents as a rural residential area." I revised it to: "Until the end of the 1890s, Sagan was included in the official rural residential area list." But the correct translation should be: "Until the end of the 1890s, Sagan was calculated in the official rural residential area list," meaning that it would not be included later, so my translation, like Wang's translation, completely contradicted the original meaning. Because the attention at that time was completely attracted by the prominent error of "official documents," I neglected the main error of "only" and copied it down, which led to my own mistake. This kind of negligence is worth my eternal vigilance.

　　In addition, he pointed out that my revised translation was somewhat unclear, which is also correct. I think it should be revised to: "That cunning mountain often hides some collapsing snow blocks for future needs." I should strengthen my learning of the expressive power of Chinese.

　　I thank him for his kindness and sincerely accept his corrections. I am willing to improve my practical and careful sense of responsibility in future work. Please publish this letter to correct my mistakes to the readers.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sincerely,

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ling Yin

### 认真改进翻译工作

　　认真改进翻译工作
    编者按：本刊第四十一期刊载了三篇指摘苏联小说译文错误的文章后，收到潮锋出版社的一封来信。该社对它所出版的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》译本的批评，表示接受，并决定重译这部小说。我们认为这种态度是很好的。现在把该社来信发表于下。另外，我们又收到一见先生的一封信，他指出凌茵批评王仲桓译《萨根的春天》一文内，凌茵的改译亦有错误和意义不明处。经将原信转凌茵同志阅后，他认为这个指出是必要的，正确的。兹将凌茵同志的来信也发表于下：
    潮锋出版社来函编辑同志：
    三月二十六日贵报第四十一期人民文艺栏内朱子平先生批评本社出版的冯驺先生所译的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》全部新译本译文的错误一文我们已经读到。我们认为不但应该虚心接受，而且应该郑重道谢。
    回忆该书的第一个译本，远在一九三七年出版，系段洛夫、陈非璜二先生由日文本重译的。当时读者和本社都感到该书的译文不完善，惟并不失却原意，在那时又没有人做这个工作，而当时这书的需要，又很迫切。在这种情况下，本社便贸然的把它出版了。但在本社出版工作的立场上来说，对于出版革命文艺的重要书籍，而把不完善的译本，长期的因循不改，这是有背本社出版工作一贯的严肃立场的。因此，在一九四八年重新鼓起我们的勇气，请冯驺先生重译为全部新译本，把不完善的旧译本全部销毁了，（就是在版权上，我们也明文刊注着。）以表示我们对读者的负责态度。
    冯驺先生是根据英文本译出的，校对工作员是根据中文原稿校对的，未经从原文校对过，这是一般出版业出书的普通过程。至于我们对译文认识的不够，这是对读者直接和间接都应该负责的，绝对不愿诿避我们在出版工作上的责任，不过希望读者原谅我们还年青，我们还在学习，在工作上求进步。
    兹经敝社自我检讨后，愿诚意接受舆论意见，并决定以行动表明敝社之工作态度。即日起，敝社将该种译本停止重版，并请禾金及孙肇坤两先生重行根据最新（一九四八年）俄文原本，彻底新译，借以完成介绍世界文艺名著之严肃任务。专此奉闻，并望时赐指教，以匡不逮。此请撰安
                              潮锋出版社谨启
                                      一九五○、四、二。
    凌茵同志来函《人民文艺》编辑同志：
    承转下天津一见先生对三月二十六日人民文艺第四十一期上我批评王仲桓译的《萨根的春天》一文的意见，已仔细读过。一见先生的意见是正确的。他一方面赞成对王译本作批评，同时指出我在批评中又犯了错误。既鼓励又教育了我。
    一见先生所指出来的我的错误，是在我那篇文章里指摘王译本错误的第二条。王译是：“在上世纪九十年代之末，萨根方才在国家的公文书中，列入为农村居地”。我把它改译成：“直到上世纪九十年代末，萨根才被计入官方的农村居地表内”。但是正确的译文应该是：“一直到上世纪九十年代末，萨庚都计算在官方的农村居地表内”，意思是以后才不计入，所以我的译文和王译一样，完全跟原意相违反了。因为当时的注意力完全被“公文书”这个突出的错误所吸引，反而忽略了“方才”这个主要错误，而照抄下来，以致自己也犯了错误，这种疏忽是值得自己永远警惕的。
    此外他又指出我的改译有一处意思欠明确，也是对的，我想应改译为：“那狡猾的山经常隐藏着一些崩落的雪块，以备不时之需”。我应该加强学习中文的表现力。
    我感谢他的好意，并且衷心接受他的指正，愿在以后的工作中提高切实仔细的负责精神。请编辑同志将这封信发表，以便对读者改正我的错误。
                      此致敬礼！
                                                  凌茵
                                                       四月三日
