Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 27th: Spring agricultural production work in rural areas of southern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and eastern Sichuan is now entering the sowing stage. Farmers in various parts of the southern Sichuan administrative region completed rice sowing around the Qingming Festival. In some areas, the rice seedlings have already emerged to a height of over three inches. Farmers in Zigong, Fushun, and other places in the region are now stepping up efforts to reclaim wasteland and plant crops such as soybeans, peanuts, cotton, and corn. After the water was released from the weirs in various parts of the western Sichuan administrative region, there was also a general spring rain on the 19th, and farmers are now rushing to plant rice. In the Chengdu Plain of this region, 3 million mu of spring fields have been universally planted with rice, and other dryland crops such as sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes have also been planted successively. The spring plowing and sowing work in various counties near Chongqing in the eastern Sichuan region has been successfully completed. Among them, farmers in Bishan, Beibei, and other places are now actively reclaiming wasteland.

During the spring agricultural production, the Southwest Military and Political Committee and local people's governments have carried out work such as issuing agricultural loans, promoting improved varieties, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, actively supporting farmers in spring plowing and sowing. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy of the Southwest Military and Political Committee promoted more than 113,900 jin of improved rice seeds in the three districts of eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and southern Sichuan. The Wanxian Special Office of eastern Sichuan allocated 2 million jin of grain seeds to farmers as loans for planting. The Western Sichuan Administrative Office sent personnel to Mianyang, Guanghan, Huayang, and other counties to prevent and control rice borers. At the same time, the administrative office cultivated 1.3 million cc of bovine plague vaccine serum to prevent the annual epidemic of bovine plague.

In areas harassed by bandits, local farmers spontaneously organized joint defenses to protect spring agricultural production, and the People's Liberation Army in various places also actively suppressed bandits and assisted farmers in carrying out spring plowing.

    【新华社重庆二十七日电】川南、川西、川东等地农村的春耕生产工作，现正进入播种阶段。川南行政区各地农民，在清明前后已将稻谷播种完毕。有些地区秧苗已出土三寸余高。该区自贡、富顺等地农民，现正加紧开荒和种植黄豆、花生、棉花、包谷等作物。川西行政区各地水堰放水后，十九日又普降春雨，农民们正突击种植稻谷。该区成都平原三百万亩春田已普遍种上水稻，其他高粱、包谷、红薯等旱地作物也都已陆续种上。川东区重庆附近各县的春耕播种工作已顺利完成，其中壁山、北碚等地农民现正在积极开垦荒地。
    在春耕生产中，西南军政委员会和各地人民政府曾进行发放农贷、推广优良品种和防治病虫害等工作，积极扶助农民进行春耕播种。西南军政委员会农林水利处在川东、川西、川南三区推广了十一万三千九百余斤改良水稻种子。川东万县专署拨出二百万斤谷种贷给农民播种。川西行政公署派员赴绵阳、广汉、华阳等县防治螟虫，同时，该行署又培植一百三十万西西牛瘟菌苗血清，以防治年年都有流行的牛瘟。
    在有土匪骚扰的地区，当地农民自动组织联防，保卫春耕生产，各地人民解放军也积极清剿土匪，协助农民进行春耕。
