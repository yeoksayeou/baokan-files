Title: Speech at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union – May 16, 1928
Author: Sidalin (Stalin)
Date: 1950-04-09
Page: 4

This report was made five years after the socialist peaceful construction in the Soviet Union. A total of three issues were discussed. Its basic principles are entirely applicable to our current construction of New Democratic China. The original was first published in Pravda, No. 113, May 17, 1928, and is now found in Volume 11 of Stalin's Collected Works, published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1949.
                                    —Editor

Comrades! It is customary to talk about achievements at congresses. There is no doubt that we have achievements. Of course, these achievements are not small, and there is no need to hide them. But, comrades, recently the achievements have been talked about so much, and often in such a sweet way, that there is no interest in repeating them again. Therefore, please allow me not to follow the general rules, not to talk to you about our achievements, but to talk about our shortcomings and the tasks related to these shortcomings.

Comrades, I am referring to the tasks that include the problems of our domestic construction.

These tasks concern three issues: the issue of our political work line, the issue of raising the enthusiasm of the general masses, especially the working class, and the issue of fighting against bureaucracy, and finally, the issue of cultivating new cadres for our economic construction.

            One Strengthening the Combat Readiness of the Working Class

Let's start with the first issue. The characteristic of our current period is that we have been building for five years under conditions of peaceful development. When I say conditions of peaceful development, I mean not only that we have not fought with foreign enemies, but also that there are no factors of civil war within the country. This is what we call the conditions of peaceful development of our construction.

You know that we fought the capitalists of the whole world for three years in order to win these conditions of peaceful development. You know that we have won these conditions, and we consider this our greatest achievement. But, comrades, any victory, even this victory, has its reverse side. The conditions of peaceful construction have not been without influence on us. These conditions have left their mark on our work, on our staff, and on their psychology. In these five years, we have been moving forward calmly as if on a track. Therefore, many of our staff have the feeling that everything will be smooth sailing, that we are almost sitting on a special express train, heading straight to socialism without changing trains along the track.

On this basis, the theory of "drifting along," the theory of "maybe it's possible," the theory that "everything will work out naturally," the theory that there are no classes here, that our enemies are subdued, and that everything will go smoothly, has arisen. From this comes the tendency to be lazy and doze off. This psychology of dozing off, this psychology of letting work "drift along," is precisely the reverse side of the period of peaceful development.

What is the danger of these emotions? It is that they blind the eyes of the working class, prevent the working class from seeing its enemies clearly, paralyze the working class with exaggerated words about how weak our enemies are, and undermine the combat readiness of the working class.

It is impermissible to console oneself with the idea that our Party has one million members, the Communist Youth League has two million members, and the Trade Union has ten million members, so there is every guarantee of finally defeating the enemy. Comrades, this is not correct. History tells us that the largest armies have been defeated due to pride, excessive confidence in their own strength, excessive underestimation of the enemy's strength, dozing off, and loss of combat readiness, resulting in being attacked and caught off guard in times of emergency.

The largest party can be attacked and caught off guard, the largest party can perish, if it does not take into account the lessons of history, if it does not train its class's combat readiness day by day. Comrades, being attacked and falling into a state of being caught off guard is the most dangerous thing. Being attacked and falling into a state of being caught off guard is to become a victim of "accidents," a victim of panic in the face of the enemy. And the result of panic is disintegration, defeat, and destruction.

I can give you many examples from the life of our army during the domestic revolutionary war, when small units could completely defeat large army groups, if these large army groups were not fully combat-ready. I can tell you that in 1920, three cavalry divisions with no less than five thousand cavalrymen were defeated and scattered by an infantry battalion, simply because the cavalry divisions, caught off guard, were completely panicked in the face of the enemy, they did not know that the enemy was originally very small in number, and if they had not been in a state of dozing off before and were not in a state of panic and helplessness later, they could have defeated the enemy in one fell swoop.

The same must be said for our Party, for our Communist Youth League, for our Trade Union, and generally for our strength. It is not right to think that we no longer have class enemies, that class enemies have been defeated and eliminated. No, comrades, our class enemies still exist. And not only do they exist, but they are also growing, attempting to rise up against the Soviet regime.

The difficulties we had in procuring grain this winter, that is, the attempt by capitalist elements in the countryside to undermine the policies of the Soviet regime, illustrates this point.

The Shakhty Affair, that is, the manifestation of the joint opposition of international capital and our bourgeoisie to the Soviet regime, illustrates this point.

Many, many facts in domestic and foreign policy also illustrate this point, facts that you all know, so there is no need to talk more about them here.

It is impermissible to remain silent about these enemies of the working class. It is a sin to underestimate the strength of the class enemies of the working class. Especially now, during the period of peaceful development in our country, when the sleeping theory and the "drifting along" theory, which undermine the combat readiness of the working class, have a good base under their feet, it is impermissible to remain silent about this.

The great educational significance of the grain procurement crisis and the Shakhty Affair lies in the fact that they shook all our organizations, broke the theory of "drifting along," and once again emphasized that we have class enemies who are not sleeping, so we must consolidate the strength of the working class, its vigilance, its revolutionary spirit, and its combat readiness to oppose these enemies.

Therefore, the Party's current task, the political line of its daily work, is to enhance the combat readiness of the working class to oppose its class enemies.

It cannot be pointed out that this Communist Youth League Congress, especially the "China Youth Daily," is now closer to this task than ever before. You know that the speakers' speeches and the articles in the "China Youth Daily" all pointed out the importance of this task. Comrades, this is very good. However, it must be ensured that everyone does not regard this task as a temporary and fleeting one, because the task of strengthening the combat readiness of the proletariat is such a task that as long as classes exist in our country, as long as we are surrounded by capitalist countries, this task should run through our entire work.

            Two Organize Mass Criticism from Bottom to Top

The second issue is about the task of fighting bureaucracy, about the task of organizing mass criticism of our shortcomings, and about the task of organizing mass supervision from bottom to top.

The most formidable enemy in our progress is bureaucracy. Bureaucracy lives in all our organizations—whether in the Party organization, the Communist Youth League organization, the Trade Union organization, or the economic work organization. When it comes to bureaucrats, people usually point to those non-Party old officials who are often drawn with glasses in cartoons (laughter). Comrades, this is not entirely correct. If the problem only lay with the old bureaucrats, then the struggle against bureaucracy would be the easiest thing. The trouble is that the problem does not lie with the old bureaucrats. Comrades, the problem lies with the new bureaucrats, with the bureaucrats who sympathize with the Soviet regime, and finally, the problem lies with the Communist Party bureaucrats. Communist Party bureaucrats are the most dangerous kind of bureaucrats. Why? Because they hide their bureaucracy under the guise of being Party members. Unfortunately, there are quite a few such Communist Party bureaucrats here.

Take our Party organizations at all levels, for example. Perhaps you have seen the Smolensk case, the Artyomovsk case, and so on in the newspapers. Is this accidental? How can we explain the shameful facts of moral corruption and depravity that have occurred in certain links of our Party organizations at all levels? This is due to the absurd use of the Party's right to manage everything, drowning out the voices from below, eliminating democracy within the Party, and cultivating bureaucracy. How can we combat this poison? I believe that there is no other way to combat this poison except to organize mass supervision of the Party from bottom to top and to cultivate democracy within the Party. What can be used to counter the anger of the Party masses to deal with these corrupt elements and enable these masses to beat them up? There is almost nothing to counter this.

Or, for example, take the Communist Youth League. You will certainly not deny that there are completely corrupt elements in some places in the Communist Youth League, and it is absolutely necessary to wage a relentless struggle against these elements. But leave the corrupt elements aside. Take the fact that some members of the Communist Youth League have recently been engaged in unprincipled struggles around a few people, which has poisoned the air in the Communist Youth League. Why are there as many "Gazalievs" and "Sobolevs" as you want in the Communist Youth League, while Marxists can only be found with lanterns? (Applause.) What does this fact illustrate if not that some links in the upper echelons of the Communist Youth League are in the process of bureaucratic ossification?

And what about the Trade Union? Who would deny that there are countless cases of bureaucracy in the Trade Union? We have production committees in enterprises. Under the Trade Union, we have temporary inspection committees. The task of these organizations is to awaken the masses, expose our shortcomings, and point out ways to improve our construction. Why haven't these organizations developed? Why aren't they vibrant? Bureaucracy in the Trade Union, coupled with bureaucracy in the Party organization, prevents the development of these extremely important organizations of the working class. Isn't this clear enough?

Finally, our economic organizations. Who would deny that our economic organs are not suffering from the disease of bureaucracy? Take the Shakhty Affair, for example. Doesn't the Shakhty Affair show that our economic organs are not moving forward, but crawling and dragging along?

How can we put an end to bureaucracy in all these organizations?

There is only one way to do this—organize supervision from bottom to top, organize the criticism of our organs' bureaucracy, their shortcomings, and their mistakes by millions of working-class masses.

I know that when arousing the anger of the masses to fight against the evil deeds of bureaucracy in our organizations, it is often necessary to involve some comrades who have had merits in the past but are now suffering from bureaucracy. But does this prevent us from organizing supervision from bottom to top? I think this cannot and should not prevent it. We should bow to them for their old merits, and we should beat them up for their new mistakes and bureaucracy. (Laughter, applause.) Otherwise, what should we do? Since the interests of the cause require it, why not do it?

People usually talk about criticism from above, criticism from the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, criticism from our Party Central Committee, and so on. All of this is certainly very good. But it is far from enough. Not only that, the main point is definitely not here. The main thing now is to launch the broadest wave of criticism from bottom to top against bureaucracy in general and especially against the shortcomings in our work. Only by organizing two-way pressure—pressure from top to bottom and pressure from bottom to top, only by shifting the focus to criticism from bottom to top, can we expect to successfully fight and eradicate bureaucracy.

It is wrong to think that only leaders have experience in construction. Comrades, this is not right. The millions of working-class masses who are building our industry are accumulating tremendous experience in construction day by day, and this experience is equally valuable to us as the experience of the leaders. We need mass criticism from bottom to top, supervision from bottom to top, also in order not to waste the experience of these millions of people in vain, in order to study and realize this experience.

Therefore, the Party's current task is to wage a relentless struggle against bureaucracy, to organize mass criticism from bottom to top, and to take this criticism into account in the practical decisions on eliminating our shortcomings.

It cannot be said that the Communist Youth League, especially the "China Youth Daily," has not taken into account the importance of this task. Here, the shortcoming is that this task is often not thoroughly implemented. And to thoroughly implement this task, it is necessary not only to take criticism into account, but also to take into account the results of criticism, to take into account the improvements made as a result of criticism.

            Three Youth Should Master Science

The third task is about organizing new cadres for socialist construction.

Comrades, we are faced with the extremely great task of transforming our entire national economy. In agriculture, we must lay the foundation for large-scale, joint public farms. From Comrade Molotov's statement today, you should know that the Soviet regime has put forward this extremely difficult task: to unite small, scattered farms into collective farms and establish new, large-scale Soviet grain farms. These tasks are such that without solving them, there can be no major and rapid progress.

If the Soviet regime relies on the largest and most concentrated production in industry, then in agriculture it relies on the most dispersed and small-scale peasant economy, which is an economy of semi-commodity production, which, although it has reached the pre-war sowing area standard, produces much less commodity grain than the pre-war economy. This is the root cause of the various difficulties that may arise in grain procurement in the future. In order to get rid of this situation, it is necessary to seriously start organizing large-scale social agricultural production. But to organize large-scale production, it is necessary to know agricultural science. However, to know, it is necessary to learn. But we have too few people here who know agricultural science. Therefore, the task is to cultivate young, new cadres who can build new social agriculture.

In industry, our situation is much better. But here, too, the lack of new construction cadres hinders our progress. Just recalling the Shakhty Affair is enough to understand how urgent the issue of new cadres for socialist industrial construction is. Of course, we have old experts in industrial construction. But, first, we have very few of these experts, second, not all of them are willing to build new industries, third, many of them do not understand the new tasks of construction, and fourth, a large part of them are already old and useless. In order to move the cause forward, it is necessary to accelerate the cultivation of new experts from the working class, from Communist Party members, and from Communist Youth League members.

Whether in agriculture or industry, we have countless people who are willing to participate in construction and lead construction. But we have too few people who are good at building and leading construction. On the contrary, our ignorance in this area is truly frightening. Not only that, we also have some people who are willing to praise our lack of culture. If you are illiterate or you misspell words and are proud of your backwardness, then you are a worker "by the machine," you are glorious, and you are respected. If you get rid of illiteracy, learn to read, and master science, then you are an alien element, "detached" from the masses, and no longer a worker.

I believe that if we do not eradicate this barbaric and ignorant phenomenon, if we do not eradicate this barbaric attitude towards science and cultural people, we will not be able to move forward even one step. The working class cannot become the true master of the country if it cannot get rid of illiteracy, if it cannot cultivate its own intellectuals, if it cannot master science, and if it cannot manage the economy on the basis of science.

Comrades, it must be understood that the conditions of the current struggle are different from those during the domestic revolutionary war. During the domestic revolutionary war, enemy positions could be won by attacking, courage, force, and cavalry-like charges. Now, under the conditions of peaceful economic construction, only cavalry-like charges can mess things up. Courage and force are still needed as before. However, relying on courage and force alone will not get us very far. Now, to defeat the enemy, we must be good at building industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce, and we must abandon the lordly arrogance towards commerce.

To build, we must have knowledge, we must master science. And to have knowledge, we must learn. Learn stubbornly and patiently. Learn from everyone—whether from enemies or friends, especially from enemies. Learn, clench our teeth, not afraid of the enemy laughing at us, laughing at our ignorance, laughing at our backwardness.

We have a fortress in front of us. This fortress is called science, and it has many, many branches of knowledge. We must take this fortress no matter what. Youth must take it if they want to become builders of a new life, if they want to become true replacements for the old guard.

Now we cannot limit ourselves to cultivating general Communist cadres and general Bolshevik cadres who know a little bit about everything. A smattering of knowledge and self-righteousness are now shackles for us. We now need Bolshevik experts in the hardware industry, the textile industry, the fuel industry, the chemical industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, accounting, and so on. We now need entire groups of hundreds and thousands of Bolshevik experts who can master one thing in various fields of knowledge. Without this, there is no need to talk about the rapid speed of our socialist construction. Without this, there is no need to talk about us catching up with and surpassing advanced capitalist countries.

Mastering science, training Bolshevik experts in all fields of knowledge, learning, learning, learning most stubbornly—this is the task now.

The revolutionary youth's mass march towards science—comrades, this is what we need now. (Thunderous applause. Shouting: "Hurrah!" All stand up.)
                                        (Translated by Cao Baohua and Mao Anqing)

　　在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上的演说
    ——一九二八年五月十六日
    斯大林
    这一报告是在苏联社会主义和平建设已经五年以后作的。一共讲了三个问题。其基本原则对于目前我们建设新民主主义中国是完全适用的。原文第一次发表于一九二八年五月十七日真理报第一一三期，现在见一九四九年莫斯科外文局出版的斯大林全集第十一卷。
                                    ——编者
    同志们！在代表大会上通常照例是要讲一讲成绩的。毫无疑问，我们是有成绩的。当然，这些成绩并不小，而且也用不着把它们隐藏起来。但是，同志们，最近一个时候把成绩讲得那样多而且往往讲得那样甜蜜，使人再没有任何兴味来重复一遍了。因此，请容许我不遵守一般的规矩，不向你们谈我们的成绩，而谈一谈我们的缺点以及与这些缺点有关的任务。
    同志们，我所指的是包括我们国内建设问题的任务。
    这些任务是关于三个问题：我们政治工作路线的问题，提高一般广大人民群众的积极性、特别是工人阶级的积极性以及与官僚主义作斗争的问题，最后，培养我们经济建设新干部的问题。
            一  加强工人阶级的战斗准备
    我们就从第一个问题开始吧。我们目前这个时期的特点，就是我们在和平发展的条件下建设五年了。我说和平发展的条件，意思不只是指我们没有与国外敌人作战，而且是指国内没有内战因素了。这便是我们所称为的我国建设的和平发展条件。
    你们知道，我们与全世界资本家打了三年的仗，就是为了赢得这些和平发展的条件。你们知道，我们赢得了这些条件，我们认为这是我们最伟大的成就。但是，同志们，任何胜利，连这个胜利也在内，还有自己的反面。和平建设的条件对于我们并不是没有影响的。这些条件在我们的工作上、在我们的工作人员身上，在他们的心理上都刻下了自己的标记。在这五年中，我们就像在轨道上一样平静地前进着。因此，我们许多工作人员便有了这样的情绪：一切都将是一帆风顺，我们差不多是坐在特别快车上，沿着轨道一直不换车地开到社会主义那里去。
    在这个基础上便产生了“自流”论，“也许可能”论，以为自然而然“一切都会搞起来”的理论，以为我们这里已经没有阶级、我们的敌人服贴了，一切都将如意而行的理论。由此便产生了懒惰、打瞌睡的倾向。这种打瞌睡的心理，这种让工作“自流”的心理，正是和平发展时期的反面。
    这些情绪的危险性是在什么地方呢？是在于它们蒙蔽工人阶级的眼睛，不让工人阶级看清楚自己的敌人，以我们敌人如何衰弱的夸张之词来麻痹工人阶级，并且破坏工人阶级的战斗准备。
    不可以这样的想法而自慰：我们党有一百万党员，共青团有两百万团员，职工会有一千万会员，因此最后战胜敌人便有了一切保证。同志们，这是不对的。历史告诉我们说：最大的军队之覆没，是由于骄傲，过于相信自己的力量，过于轻视敌人的力量，打瞌睡，丧失了战斗准备，结果在紧急关头被袭击而手足无所措。
    最大的党是可以被袭击而手足无所措的，最大的党是可以灭亡的，如果它不考虑到历史的教训，如果它不一天天地锻炼自己阶级的战斗准备。同志们，被袭击而陷于手足无所措的地步，是最危险不过的事情了。被袭击而陷于手足无所措的地步，就是成为“意外”的牺牲品，在敌人面前惊惶失措的牺牲品。而惊惶失措的结果，便是瓦解、失败、灭亡。
    我可以给你们举出国内战争时期我们军队生活中的许多例子，那时候小队伍可以把大军团完全击溃，如果这些大军团没有充分战斗准备的话。我可以告诉你们：在一九二○年，不下五千骑兵的三个骑兵师被一个步兵营所击溃而四散逃亡，这仅仅是因为被袭击而手足无所措的骑兵师在敌人面前完全惊惶失措的原故，它们不知道这个敌人原来人数是极小的，如果它们在此以前不处于打瞌睡的状态，而后来也不处于惊惶失措和束手无策的状态，那么它们一下子就能把这个敌人打得落花流水。
    对于我们的党，对于我们的共青团，对于我们的职工会，一般对于我们的力量，也必须这样说。以为我们已经没有阶级敌人，阶级敌人已经被击溃和消灭了，这是不对的。不，同志们，我们的阶级敌人还存在着。并且不仅存在着，而且还在生长，企图起来反对苏维埃政权。
    我们今年冬季采办粮食的困难，即农村资本主义分子之企图破坏苏维埃政权的政策，便说明了这一点。
    沙赫亭事件，即国际资本和我国资产阶级共同反对苏维埃政权的表现，便说明了这一点。
    对内政策和对外政策方面许多许多的事实，也说明了这一点，这些事实你们都知道，所以用不着在这里多谈了。
    对工人阶级的这些敌人保持沉默，是不容许的。过低估计工人阶级阶级敌人的力量，就是罪恶。特别是现在，在我国和平发展时期，当破坏工人阶级战斗准备的睡觉理论和“自流”理论在自己脚下有着良好基地的时候，对于这一点保持沉默，是不容许的。
    粮食采办危机和沙赫亭事件的巨大教育意义就在于：它们震动了我们所有的组织，打破了“自流”论，又一次地着重指出我们有阶级敌人存在着，他们并没有睡觉，所以我们必须巩固工人阶级的力量、它的警惕性、它的革命性、它的战斗准备，来反对这些敌人。
    所以党当前的任务，其日常工作的政治路线就是：提高工人阶级的战斗准备来反对它的阶级敌人。
    不能不指出：这次共青团代表大会，尤其是“共青真理”报，现在比以往任何时候都更接近于这个任务。你们知道，发言人的讲话以及“共青真理”报的文章，都指出了这个任务的重要性。同志们，这是很好的。不过必须使大家不要把这个任务看作暂时的和转瞬即逝的任务，因为加强无产阶级战斗准备的任务是这样的一个任务，只要我们国家里还存在着阶级，只要我们还有资本主义国家的包围，就应该使这个任务贯串着我们的整个工作。
            二  组织自下而上的群众性批评
    第二个问题是关于与官僚主义作斗争的任务，关于组织对我们缺点的群众性批评的任务，关于组织自下而上的群众性监督的任务。
    我们前进中最厉害的敌人，就是官僚主义。官僚主义在我们所有的组织中都活着——不论在党的组织中，少共的组织中，职工会的组织中，经济工作的组织中。当一讲到官僚主义分子的时候，通常总是手指着在漫画里常常被画成带着眼镜的那些非党的旧官员（笑声）。同志们，这不是完全正确的。如果问题只在于旧的官僚主义分子身上，那末与官僚主义作斗争便是最容易不过的事情了。糟糕的便是问题不在于旧的官僚主义分子身上。同志们，问题是在于新的官僚主义分子身上，在于同情苏维埃政权的官僚主义分子身上，最后，问题是在于共产党员官僚主义分子身上。共产党官僚主义分子是最危险的一种官僚主义分子。为什么呢？因为他是以党员的称号来掩饰自己的官僚主义。然而可惜得很，像这样的共产党员官僚主义分子，我们这里还不少呢。
    试拿我们各级党组织来说吧。也许你们在报纸上看到了斯摩林斯克案件、阿尔特莫夫案件等等。试问，这是偶然的吗？怎样来解释我们党各级组织某些环节中所发生的道德败坏和沦丧的可耻事实呢？这是由于把党的管理一切的权利使用得荒谬已极，淹没了来自下层的声音，消灭了党内的民主，培植了官僚主义。怎样来反对这个毒害呢？我认为除了组织党的自下而上的群众性监督以外，除了培植党内民主以外，是没有而且也不能有任何其他的办法来反对这个毒害的。有什么可以反对激起党的群众的怒火来对付这些腐化分子并使这些群众能够把他们揍一顿呢？几乎没有什么可以反对这一点。
    或者，比方说，拿共青团来说吧。你们当然不会否认：在共青团里某些地方有完全腐化的分子，与这些分子作无情的斗争是绝对必要的。可是把腐化分子丢在一边吧。就拿最近共青团里一部分团员围绕着几个人所进行的无原则的斗争的事实来说，这个斗争是把共青团内的空气都毒化了。为什么在共青团内“加沙里夫们”和“梭波列夫们”要多少就有多少，而马克思主义者就只好打着灯笼去找呢？（鼓掌。）这个事实是说明什么呢，如果不是说明共青团上层机构某些环节正处在官僚主义僵化过程中？
    而职工会呢？谁会否认职工会里的官僚主义真是数也数不尽呢？在企业中我们有生产委员会。在职工会下我们有临时监察委员会。这些组织的任务就是唤醒群众，揭露我们的缺点，指出改善我们建设的途径。为什么我们的这些组织没有发展起来呢？为什么它们不生气勃勃呢？职工会里的官僚主义，加上党组织里的官僚主义，就不让工人阶级这些极重要的组织发展起来。这难道还不明白吗？
    最后，我们的经济组织。谁会否认我们的经济机关没有害官僚主义的病呢？就拿沙赫亭事件来讲吧。难道沙赫亭事件不是说明我们经济机关不是在前进，而是在爬着、拖着吗？
    怎样才能结束这一切组织里的官僚主义呢？
    为此而仅仅有唯一的一个途径——组织自下而上的监督，组织千百万工人阶级群众对我们机关的官僚主义、对其缺点、对其错误的批评。
    我知道，在掀起群众的怒火来反对我们组织里的官僚主义邪恶行为的时候，往往不得不牵动某些过去曾有过功劳而现在害了官僚主义病的同志。但是这就能阻止我们组织自下而上的监督工作吗？我认为这是不能和不应当阻止的。由于旧的功劳，应该向他们鞠躬，而由于新的错误和官僚主义，就应该揍他们一顿。（笑声，鼓掌。）否则就该怎样呢？既然事业的利益要求如此，为什么不这样作呢？
    一般是讲来自上面的批评，来自工农监察委员会方面的批评，来自我们党中央方面的批评等等。这一切当然都很好。但这还远远不够。不仅如此，主要的决不在这里。现在主要的是在于掀起自下而上的一般反对官僚主义、特别反对我们工作缺点的最广泛的批评浪潮。只有组织两面的压力——自上而下的与自下而上的压力，只有把重点移到自下而上的批评，才能期望顺利地斗争及铲除官僚主义。
    以为仅仅领导者才有建设经验，这是错误的。同志们，这是不对的。建设我国工业的千百万工人群众一天天地积累着巨大的建设经验，这个经验较之领导者的经验对于我们是同等宝贵的。我们需要自下而上的群众性批评、自下而上的监督，就中也是为了不使千百万群众的这个经验白白地丧失，是为了研究和实现这个经验。
    因此，党当前的任务就是：与官僚主义作无情的斗争，组织自下而上的群众性批评，在关于消灭我们缺点的实际决定中考虑到这个批评。
    不能说共青团、特别是“共青真理”报没有考虑到这个任务的重要性。在这里缺点是往往没有把这个任务彻底执行。而要把这个任务彻底执行，就必须不仅要考虑到批评，而且要考虑到批评的结果，考虑到由于批评而实行的改进。
            三  青年应当掌握科学
    第三个任务是关于组织社会主义建设新干部的问题。
    同志们，在我们面前摆着改造我们整个国民经济的极伟大的任务。在农业方面，我们应当给大规模的联合的公共农庄打下基础。从今天莫洛托夫同志的宣言，你们应当知道：苏维埃政权已提出了这个极为困难的任务：把细小的分散的农庄联合为集体农庄，建立新的大规模的苏维埃谷物农庄。这是属于这样的一些任务，不解决这些任务，就不可能有重大的和迅速的前进。
    如果在工业方面苏维埃政权是依靠最大的和集中的生产，那末在农业方面它却依靠最分散的和细小的农民经济，这种农民经济是半商品生产的经济，虽然达到了战前的播种面积标准，但它所生产的商品谷物较之战前的经济所生产的要少得多。这便是将来在粮食采办方面可能发生的各种困难的根源之所在。为要摆脱这种情况，就必须认真着手组织大规模的农业社会生产。但要组织大规模的生产，就必须知道农业科学。然而要知道，就必须学习。可是知道农业科学的人，我们这里少得太不像样了。因此，任务便是要培植建设新社会农业的年青新干部。
    在工业方面，我们的事情就好得多。但是在这里缺乏新的建设干部，也妨碍着我们的前进。只要回忆一下沙赫亭事件，就足以了解社会主义工业建设新干部的问题是如何地迫切。当然，我们有工业建设方面的旧专家们。但是，第一，这些专家，我们很少，第二，他们不是全都愿意建设新工业的，第三，他们许多还不懂得建设方面的新任务，第四，他们很大一部分已经老了，不中用了。为要把事业向前推进，就必须从工人阶级、从共产党员、从共青团员加速培植新的专家。
    无论在农业方面和工业方面，我们愿意参加建设和领导建设的人真是数也数不尽的。而我们善于建设和领导的人却少得太不像样。相反地，我们在这一方面的无知真是可怕极了。不仅如此，我们还有这样的一些人，他们甘愿歌颂我们的无文化。如果你不识字或者你写别字并且以自己的落后而自豪，——那你就是“车床旁边的”工人，你就光荣，就被尊重。如果你摆脱了无文化，学会了识字，掌握了科学，——那你就是异己分子，“脱离”群众，不再是工人了。
    我认为：我们如果不根绝这种野蛮和蒙昧的现象，不根绝这种对科学和文化人的野蛮态度，就会一步也不能前进。工人阶级如果不能从无文化中摆脱出来，如果不能培养出自己的知识分子，如果不能掌握科学和不能在科学基础上管理经济，就不能成为真正的国家主人。
    同志们，必须懂得现在的斗争条件比起国内战争时期不同了。在国内战争时期，敌人阵地是可以用攻打、勇敢、猛力、骑兵似的冲锋取得的。现在，在和平经济建设条件下，用骑兵似的冲锋只能是把事情搞坏。勇敢和猛力现在也如以前一样是需要的。但是，只靠勇敢和猛力是走不很远的。现在要打败敌人，就必须善于建立工业、农业、运输业、商业，就必须抛弃对于商业的老爷式的高傲态度。
    要建设，就必须有知识，就必须掌握科学。而要有知识，就必须学习。顽强地、耐心地学习。向谁都学习——不论向敌人或向朋友，尤其要向敌人学习。学习，咬紧牙齿，不怕敌人笑我们，笑我们无知，笑我们落后。
    我们面前有一个堡垒。这个堡垒叫作科学，它有许多许多的知识部门。这个堡垒我们不管怎样要把它拿下来。青年应当把它拿下来，如果他们愿意成为新生活的建设者的话，如果他们愿意成为老警卫军的真正替换者的话。
    现在我们不能只限于培养什么都会讲一点儿的一般共产主义干部、一般布尔什维克干部。一知半解和自以为是，现在对于我们是枷锁了。我们现在需要五金业、纺织业、燃料业、化学业、农业、运输业、商业、会计以及其他等等的布尔什维克专家。我们现在需要整批的成百成千的能在各种各样知识部门里精通一项的布尔什维克专家。没有这个，就用不着谈什么我国社会主义建设的很快的速度。没有这个，就用不着谈什么我们会赶上和超过先进的资本主义国家。
    掌握科学，锻炼出一切知识部门的布尔什维克专家，学习、学习、最顽强地学习，——这便是现在的任务。
    革命青年向科学作群众性的进军，——同志们，这就是我们现在所需要的。（雷霆般的鼓掌声。高喊：“乌拉！”。全体起立）
