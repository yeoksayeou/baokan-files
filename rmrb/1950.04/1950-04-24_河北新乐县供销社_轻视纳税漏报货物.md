Hebei Xinle County Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Disregards Taxation, Underreporting Goods
    [This dispatch] The Xinle County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province was found to have violated tax policies by underreporting sixty bolts of colored cloth and over one thousand catties of white oil. Since the promulgation of the new tax law, the county's tax bureau has repeatedly instructed the supply and marketing cooperative to clear its taxable goods and pay taxes according to regulations. However, the cooperative did not sufficiently recognize this, emphasizing that they were too busy and did not conduct a clearance. Only after repeated inquiries from the tax bureau did they begin a clearance. However, because their thinking was not fully straightened out and their work was not meticulous and thorough, tax evasion and underreporting were still discovered after the clearance.
    For example, on March 10th, when the cooperative transported white oil to the Ding County Oil Company, they declared 10,000 catties to the county tax bureau for taxation, but the actual amount of oil was 11,395 catties. On March 18th, the cooperative registered its cloth inventory, reporting 171 bolts of cloth in stock. However, after inspection, three bundles of colored cloth (twenty bolts per bundle), totaling sixty bolts, were found to be unregistered.
    In addition, the cooperative consistently failed to meet the prescribed deadline for consolidated payment of stamp duty, requiring the tax bureau to repeatedly urge them several times. All of this indicates that the supply and marketing cooperative still harbors a serious disregard for taxation. After verifying the facts, the tax bureau not only ordered them to pay supplementary taxes in accordance with regulations, but also gave them a stern criticism.

### 河北新乐县供销社  轻视纳税漏报货物

　　河北新乐县供销社
    轻视纳税漏报货物
    【本报讯】河北新乐县供销社违反税收政策被查出漏报色布六十匹，白油千余斤。该县税务局自新税法公布后，即再三告戒供销社清理应税物品照章完税，但该社对此认识不足，强调工作忙，不作清理，经税局催问数次后始作清理，惟因思想未完全打通，工作不细致深入，故在清理后仍被查出偷税漏税现象。
    如在三月十日，该社运白油到定县油脂公司，在县税局上税时报一○、○○○斤，但运到后实际油数为一一、三九五斤。三月十八日该社办理存布登记，报存布为一七一匹，后经检查，结果查出库存三捆色布（每捆二十匹），共六十匹未登记。
    另外该社规定的印花税汇总交纳期总不按期实行，税局每次都要催讨几次，这些都说明了供销社尚存在着严重轻视税收的观点。税局对此，经检查属实后，除令其照章补税外，并给予了严格的批评。
