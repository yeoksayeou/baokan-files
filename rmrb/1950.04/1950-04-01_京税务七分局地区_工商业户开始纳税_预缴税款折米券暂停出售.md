　　Beijing Seventh Tax Bureau District

　　Tax Collection Begins for Industrial and Commercial Businesses

　　Pre-payment Tax Discount Rice Coupon Sales Suspended

　　[Our Newspaper] The industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949 began to be collected on April 1st. The Beijing Seventh Tax Bureau, due to the dispersed nature of its district, began issuing payment slips on March 23rd to give industrial and commercial businesses sufficient time to prepare their tax payments for timely remittance to the treasury. By the 28th, all slips had been delivered to taxpayers. Eleven businesses, including the Xiyuan Wanxiang Photo Studio, Haidian Zhao's Iron Shop, Madian Hongchang Flour Mill, Xizhimen Hesunxing Coal Shop, and Ruichunyuan Rice and Flour Shop, upon receiving their payment slips, calculated the amount based on the treasury's rice price and paid the full amount in one go within two or three days. This is the conduct expected of merchants in a new democratic society. (Cao Buhe, Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau)

　　[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau notified the People's Bank on March 30th to suspend the sale of pre-payment tax discount rice coupons. Previously, the Municipal Taxation Bureau, to accommodate the difficulty of concentrated tax payments during seasonal periods, had entrusted the local People's Bank to sell pre-payment tax discount rice coupons. However, as it is currently the period for remitting the industrial and commercial tax and property tax for the second half of 1949, taxpayers can directly pay their taxes without the extra step of purchasing rice coupons. Furthermore, due to the ongoing tax remittance period, the bank's staff is insufficient and has no spare capacity for sales. Therefore, a notice has been issued to suspend sales.

　　京税务七分局地区
    工商业户开始纳税
    预缴税款折米券暂停出售
    【本报讯】一九四九年下半年工商业税，于四月一日开始征收。京市税务七分局因地区分散，为了给予工商业户以充分准备税款时间，以便到时容易纳库，于三月二十三日开始，将缴款书陆续发出。截至二十八日，业已扫数送达纳税户手里。西苑万象照像馆、海甸赵记铁铺、马甸宏昌粉房、西直门合顺兴煤铺、瑞春元米面粮等十一户，接到缴款书后的第二、三天，就一次按金库米价折算缴清。这是新民主主义社会商人应有的作风。  （北京人民政府税务局曹步和）
    【本报讯】京市税务局已于三月三十日通知人民银行暂停出售预缴税款折米券。市税务局前为照顾季节性税收集中缴纳的困难，曾委托本市人民银行代售预缴税款折米券，唯目前为一九四九年下半年工商业税及房产税入库期间，纳税人已可迳行缴纳税款，无需多费一道手续，购买折米券；且因正值税款入库期间，银行人手不敷，亦无余力发售。因而通知暂停出售。（北京人民政府税务局沈洋）
