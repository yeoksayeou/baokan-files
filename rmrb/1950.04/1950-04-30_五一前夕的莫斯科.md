Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 28th (TASS): Spring has fully arrived in Moscow, with parks and boulevards a vibrant green. Rows upon rows of linden trees along the wide streets make the red flags and streamers stand out even more distinctly. The newly erected buildings add to the beauty of the capital month by month, even day by day. Squares and streets are being adorned in festive attire. Carpenters, electricians, engineers, and artists are busy decorating Red Square. On the huge building opposite the Kremlin, the emblems of the Union Republics, symbolizing the friendship and glory of all nationalities of the Soviet state, are hung high. Everywhere one sees red flags emblazoned with the May Day slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Everywhere are towering images of Stalin, and people everywhere examine the moving slogan with sincere joy: "Glory to the great Stalin!"

　　In response to the call of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the working people of the capital are launching a socialist emulation campaign on an ever-expanding scale to complete this year's national economic plan ahead of schedule. Several enterprises in Moscow have already completed their production plans for the first four months. On the eve of the festival, the people of Moscow are sending thousands upon thousands of telegrams to relatives and friends across the country, congratulating them on their further successes in work and study.

　　The people of Moscow feel a justifiable pride in their great city, a standard-bearer for the consolidation of peace and the friendship of all nations.

　　The May Day slogans of the Lenin-Stalin Party resound throughout Moscow, heard clearly around the world: Expand and strengthen the mighty camp of supporters of peace! Defending peace is the cause of all peoples worldwide!

　　Foreign dignitaries are arriving in the Soviet capital one after another to participate in the May Day celebrations. Delegations from China, Germany, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and other countries have already arrived. The dignitaries are busy visiting factories, theaters, and museums, and meeting with representatives of Soviet culture, science, and art.

　　五一前夕的莫斯科
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：莫斯科春意方浓、公园和林荫道上一片新绿。沿着宽阔街道上的一长列一长列的菩提树，把红旗、长幡衬托得分外鲜明。新耸立起来的大厦，每个月甚至每一天都为首都增添着美丽。各个广场和街道正披上节日的盛装。木匠、电气工人和工程师、艺术家，正忙于装饰着红场。在克里姆林宫对面的巨大建筑物上，高悬着象征苏维埃国家各族人民之友谊与光荣的各加盟共和国的国徽。到处都看到一面面写着联共中央五一口号的红旗。到处都高悬着斯大林的巨像，人们到处以真情的喜悦审视着动人的标语：“光荣归于伟大的斯大林！”
    为了响应联共中央的号召，首都的劳动人民正在越来越广大的规模上，展开着先期完成今年国民经济计划的社会主义竞赛。莫斯科的若干企业已先期完成了四个月的生产计划。在节日前夕，莫斯科人民发出成千成万封电报，向全国各地的亲友祝贺他们在劳动与学习中获得进一步的成功。
    莫斯科人民为他们伟大的城市是巩固的和平与各民族友谊的旗手，而感到正当的骄傲。
    列宁——斯大林党的五一口号，在莫斯科彻响着，全世界各地都清晰地听到了：扩大并巩固强大的拥护和平阵营！保卫和平是全世界一切人民的事业！
    外国贵宾陆续抵达苏京，以参加五一节庆典。中、德、法、意、捷、丹等国的代表团都已经到了。贵宾们正忙于参观工厂、剧院和博物馆，并且会见苏联文化、科学与艺术界的代表。
