　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 15th. Most areas of Ningxia Province have basically solved the difficulties of poor farmers in spring plowing and production, such as food and seeds, by developing free and fair rural lending relationships. People's governments in Jinji, Zhongning, Helan, Pingluo and other counties have extensively promoted and explained the People's Government's free lending policy through farmers' representative meetings, seed adjustment committees, blackboards, etc., so that new rural lending relationships have been widely developed in various places. In the fourth district of Jinji County, under the promotion and mobilization of farmer representatives, more than 100 piculs of seeds were adjusted within four days. Zhang Guangbao, of the fourth township in the first district of Helan, after understanding the lending policy of the People's Government, lent 180 piculs of existing grain reserves and 17 piculs of wheat seeds to poor farmers in the township who lacked seeds. After the first district and second township of Zhongning County mobilized free lending through a forum of grain households, the problem of 142 piculs of wheat seeds lacking in poor farmers in the township was solved. The Jinji County People's Government also solved the seed difficulties of disaster victims in two districts by issuing agricultural loans. After solving the difficulties of spring plowing and production through loans, the enthusiasm of farmers in the province for production has been unprecedentedly improved, and spring plowing has now begun.

　　宁夏农村开展自由借贷
    解决种籽困难
    【新华社西安十五日电】宁夏省大部地区通过发展自由公平的农村借贷关系，基本上解决了贫苦农民春耕生产中的口粮、种籽等困难。金积、中宁、贺兰、平罗等县人民政府为开展农村自由借贷，均通过农民代表会、种籽调剂委员会、黑板报等，详细宣传解释人民政府的自由借贷政策，使新的农村借贷关系在各地普遍展开。金积县四区在农民代表的宣传和发动之下，四天内即调剂种籽百余石。贺兰一区四乡张光保了解了人民政府借贷政策后，除借出现有储粮一百八十石外，并将十七石麦种借给该乡缺乏籽种的贫苦农民。中宁县一区二乡通过有粮户座谈会，发动自由借贷后，使该乡贫苦农民缺乏一百四十二石麦种的问题获得解决。金积县人民政府并以发放农贷办法，解决了两个区灾民的籽种困难。该省农民由于借贷而解决了春耕生产的困难后，生产积极性空前提高，现已开始进行春耕。
