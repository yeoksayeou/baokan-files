　　How Does the Government Help Immigrants?
    Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau Answers Reporter's Questions

    Editor:
    I am a businessman and have long wanted to change careers and engage in labor production. Recently, many tricycle workers in Beijing have been helped by the government to move to Northeast and Northwest China for production. I wonder how the government helps? How many acres of land can each person be allocated? Are all the farm tools purchased by oneself or provided by the government? If I want to move to GuiSui or Baotou in the Northwest, can I choose voluntarily?

    Wang Jie:
    Regarding your question, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau replies as follows:
    This city's spring immigrants are divided into Suiyuan, Chahar, and Benxi in the Northeast. The Suiyuan immigration ended on April 5th. Chahar and Benxi are still in progress. The immigrants to Chahar are going to Zhangbei, Shangyi, Baoyuan, Shangdu, Huade, Kangbao, and Duolun counties in northern Chahar, and Datong and Shanyin counties in northern Yanbei. Immigrants who wish to go to a specific county can apply to the local government, which will provide assistance as much as possible according to the specific circumstances.
    When immigrants arrive there, each person can be allocated five or six acres of cultivated land and can borrow production start-up capital without interest, including food, seeds, farm tools, livestock, and resettlement expenses. Detailed figures are already published on page 4 of the March 23rd People's Daily, please refer to it.

　　政府怎样帮助移民？
    京市人民政府民政局答记者问编辑先生：
    我是一个商人，早想转业，从事劳动生产。近来北京市有许多三轮工人由政府帮助，移住东北及西北一带生产。不知政府如何帮助？每人能分到几亩地？一切农具是自己置备还是政府供给？我要移住西北归绥或是包头，是否可以自愿选择？
                                      王杰王杰君：
    你的问题，北京市人民政府民政局答复如下：
    本市春季移民，计分绥远、察哈尔及东北的本溪等处。绥远移民已于四月五日截止。察哈尔及本溪仍在进行中。赴察的移民是到察北的张北、尚义、保源、商都、化德、康保及多伦等县，和雁北的大同山阴两县。移民愿意到那个县，可以向当地政府申请，政府按照具体情况，尽可能给予照顾。
    移民到了那里，每人可分到五、六亩熟地，并可无利借到生产垫本，其中包括口粮、种籽、农具、牲畜及安家等费。详细数字已载三月二十三日人民日报第四版，请查阅。
