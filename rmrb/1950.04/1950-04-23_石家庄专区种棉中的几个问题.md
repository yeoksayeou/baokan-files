　　Several Problems in Cotton Planting in Shijiazhuang Special District
　　Liu Yongbin
　　An inspection of cotton planting preparations in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province reveals problems such as mass concerns, slow cotton seed loan disbursement, and leadership laxity that urgently need resolution. This year, the special district's cotton planting task is 2.03 million mu, accounting for one-sixth of Hebei Province's cotton planting task and one-twenty-fifth of the national task. Recent efforts by cadres and representatives at all levels have achieved some progress in preparing for cotton planting. For example, Jianping and Lingshou counties have transformed the leadership's plans into the masses' plans, and are confident in exceeding the task. All cotton fields have been harrowed and are ready, and seeds are being purchased on loan, ready for sowing. However, some counties still lack confidence in completing the task, so that the cotton fields planted by the masses are still far from the assigned task. In counties such as Zhao County, Jin County, Gaocheng, Luancheng, and Yuanshi, the current situation is only about two-thirds of the task. Pengjia Village in the Fourth District of Jin County planned to plant 1,691 mu of cotton, but the masses only planted 1,036 mu, a shortfall of 655 mu. This village can represent the situation in the northern three districts of Jin County. According to recent inspections, the main reasons for the failure to complete the task are that the following issues have not been adequately resolved:

　　(1) The ideological concerns of the masses have not been broken, and they are unwilling to plant more. First, they fear that planting too much cotton will lead to difficulties in selling it, exchanging it for grain, and a lack of livestock feed. They fear that the price of cotton will fall and they will suffer losses. Second, they fear that cotton will suffer from diseases and pests, making it less reliable than other crops. Therefore, it is still necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda on cotton price policies to dispel mass doubts and the self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy mentality. For example, at the People's Representative Conference in the Third District of Gaoyi, it was reported that Feng Jiang of Wangtong Village had 20 mu of land and used to plant 15 mu of cotton every year before the war, knowing that planting cotton was profitable. But now he is afraid of not having enough grain to eat, so he will only plant 7 mu this year. However, he said: If the government guarantees that I can exchange it for grain, I will plant all of it with cotton this year. The People's Representative Conference of the district decided to recommend that the government and supply and marketing cooperatives sign contracts with cotton farmers. It is currently planned to pilot this. In addition, the county's agricultural science department and local farms and other technical departments should conduct propaganda and education on preventing and controlling cotton pests to address the masses' current concerns about not daring to plant more cotton, and to prevent the actual problems of crop failure due to pests in the future.

　　(2) Cotton seed loan disbursement and allocation are slow. Of the 1.7 million jin of cotton seeds prepared by the Jin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, only over 9,000 jin have been exchanged and sold so far. The rest are still piled up in the county and have not been moved. Of the 820,000 jin in Zhao County, only over 60,000 jin have been sold to the masses. According to special district statistics, the counties still have over 5 million jin of Si-character cotton seeds that have not been distributed. This is a very serious problem! The reason for this is that the supply and marketing cooperatives are simply emphasizing a lack of funds and are unwilling to provide loans, focusing instead on exchange and sale. However, the masses are currently in a period of spring famine, and many households are unable to exchange and buy. The special commissioner's office, the prefectural party committee, and the general supply and marketing cooperative have negotiated and decided to focus on loans. Instructions have been given to the counties to implement this immediately. Facts have proven that in this way, cotton seeds will quickly reach the hands of the masses. For example, Gaoyi implemented it earlier, and lent out 180,000 jin in less than ten days. Lingshou County is still short of 180,000 jin of cotton seeds. The special commissioner's office plans to allocate them from Zhengding. The allocation and loan disbursement work should be completed before the Grain Rain solar term.

　　(3) Cotton planting task allocation. Jin County has 320,000 mu of irrigated land, but after deducting 80,000 mu of wheat fields, only 240,000 mu remain. It is inevitable that some early-maturing crops will have to be planted (some have already been sown, but the numbers are unknown), so the remaining cotton fields are even fewer. However, the county was assigned a task of 300,000 mu. The allocation from the district to the villages also did not proceed from reality. For example, a village in the Fourth District of Gaoyi actually has over 600 mu of irrigated and dry spring land, but was assigned a cotton planting task of 800 mu. In some villages in Zhao County, the task reaches 60-70% of the cultivated area. To complete the task, in addition to advocating for dry land spot planting and intercropping cotton and wheat in irrigated land, and mobilizing the masses not to plant other crops in the spring land but to plant cotton instead (other crops can be spot-planted in the wheat ridges or late crops can be planted after the wheat harvest), it is also necessary to review and revise and adjust the original allocated task.

　　(4) Expanding cotton fields and increasing yields are inseparable from developing water conservancy. Currently, the demand for waterwheel loans in the counties is far exceeding the supply, and cotton farmers in the countryside have been running to the city several times without being able to get them. The 80-plus waterwheels loaned out by Jin County last year were missing buckets and dippers, and were lying idle at home and could not be used. The Water Conservancy Promotion Society should rush to manufacture waterwheels and reissue buckets and dippers to meet the needs and benefit cotton planting.

　　(5) Some households are experiencing spring famine and want to use irrigated land to plant early-maturing crops to get grain to eat early, which has reduced the cotton planting area. The Gaoyi Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to lend out 900,000 jin of sorghum to key cotton planting areas and villages, to be repaid with wheat after the wheat harvest. After hearing this news at the representative meeting of the Third District, they were very supportive and decided to promote not planting sorghum among the masses, which increased their confidence in completing the 30,000 mu cotton field task.

　　(6) In some counties and districts, the leadership is only conducting political propaganda and mobilization for cotton planting and lacks concrete organizational work. They are blindly optimistic and there is some degree of bureaucratism. Some counties have not fully recognized the favorable conditions for cotton planting (1. Before the incident, Zhao, Jin, Gao, and other counties planted cotton on 50-60% of the cultivated area; 2. Some of the masses benefited from planting cotton last year, and their concerns have been reduced this year; 3. This year's labor and animal power are abundant; 4. Water conservancy construction has made progress, and irrigated land accounts for 46% of the total cultivated land in the special district) and are emphasizing that the masses are backward and unwilling to plant more, and have no confidence in completing the task. Some cadres have also developed a feeling of relief because the evaluation and reconstruction have ended and the political construction has stopped. When cadres in the Fourth District of Jin County were working on democratic political construction, their morale was very high, and some cadres persisted in working despite being ill. Recently, as soon as they heard that the political construction had stopped, they immediately became lax, going to market and loitering, and those who were sick stopped going to the countryside. As a result, the current spring plowing and cotton planting work has formed a serious state of laissez-faire. It is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership and reverse this situation, and to fully recognize that the time for cotton planting is pressing. Cadres throughout the region must strive to complete the task of 2 million mu of cotton fields.

　　石家庄专区种棉中的几个问题
    刘永彬
    河北石家庄专区检查种棉准备工作。群众顾虑，棉籽贷放，领导上松懈等问题亟待解决。该专区今年植棉任务二百零三万亩，占全河北省植棉任务的六分之一，占全国二十五分之一。近一时期的植棉准备工作，经各级干部、代表的努力，已取得一定成绩，如建屏、灵寿等县已将领导上的计划变成了群众的计划，有信心超数完成任务，所有棉田全已打耙妥当，正在贷购种子，只待播种。但还有部分县对完成任务没有信心，以致至今群众所种棉田距离分配的任务还很远。赵县、晋县、藁城、栾城、元氏等县现在情况只能完成三分之二。晋县四区彭家庄计划种棉一六九一亩，但群众只种一○三六亩尚差六五五亩。该村能代表晋县北部三个区的情况。据最近检查，完不成任务的主要原因，是由于以下几个问题未得到适当解决：
    （一）群众思想顾虑未打破，不愿多种。一是怕种棉多了卖不出去，换不来粮食和缺乏牲口草。怕到时棉价跌落吃亏；一是怕棉花生病虫，不如种其他作物保险。因此，开展广泛深入的棉价政策宣传以揭破群众怀疑与自给自足的小农经济思想还是十分必要的。如高邑三区在人代会上反映王同庄冯江二十亩地，抗战前每年种十五亩棉，他知道种棉利大。但现在怕没粮吃，今年只种七亩。但他说：如果公家保证我换到粮食，我今年就都种成棉花。该区人代会决定建议政府与供销社和棉农订合同。现正在计划试行。另外县农业科与各地农场等技术部门应向群众进行防除棉害的宣传教育工作，必要时可召开短期小型训练班，以解决群众当前不敢多种棉的顾虑，及预防将来真正因虫害而歉收的实际问题发生。
    （二）棉籽贷放与调剂迟慢。晋县供销社准备的一百七十万斤棉籽，至今才换卖下去九千余斤。其余都尚在县里堆着未动。赵县八十二万斤也才卖到群众手里六万余斤。全专统计，各县尚有五百余万斤斯字棉籽未放下去。这是十分严重的问题！检查原因是由于供销社单纯强调资金不足，不愿出贷而以换卖为主，但群众正值春荒期间，不少户实无力换买。现专署、地委、供销总社已协商决定以贷为主。指示各县立刻执行。事实证明如此棉籽即会很快到达群众手里的。如高邑执行较早，不满十天即贷出十八万斤。灵寿县棉籽还缺十八万斤。专署计划从正定给予调剂。调剂贷放工作争取谷雨节前完成。
    （三）种棉任务分配。晋县水地三二万亩，除八万亩麦田只剩二四万亩，势必还要种一部分早熟作物（有的已下种数字不详），所剩棉田更少了，但共分配该县任务三○万亩。区向村分配上也有未从实际出发的，如高邑四区一个村实有水旱春地六百余亩，分配植棉任务八百亩。赵县有的村任务达耕地面积百分之六、七十。为完成任务除提倡旱田点种与水地棉麦兼作以及动员群众春地不种其它作物，都种上棉花外（其他作物往麦陇点种或麦收后种晚田）还应把原分配任务作一番检查，进行修正和调剂，也是必要的。
    （四）扩大棉田与增加产量和发展水利是分不开的。现各县水车贷放都是供不应求，乡下棉农到城连跑数趟贷不到手。晋县去年贷的八十多辆水车没斗吊，在家搁着不能用，水利推进社应赶制水车，补发斗吊，以满足需要而利种棉。
    （五）部分户闹春荒，要用水地种早熟作物早接吃粮，以致挤少了种棉面积。高邑供销社拿出九○万斤高粱计划向种棉重点区村贷放，麦后还麦。三区代表会上听到此消息后很拥护，并决议向群众宣传不种高粱，增加了完成三万亩棉田的信心。
    （六）有的县区领导上对种棉只作政治宣传动员，缺乏具体组织工作。盲目乐观，存在某种程度的官僚主义。有的县没有充分认识到种棉的有利条件（一、该区事变前，赵、晋、藁等县即种棉达耕地面积百分之五、六十以上；二、部分群众经过去年经验种棉沾了光，今年顾虑已减少；三、今年劳畜力充裕；四、水利建设有进展，全专水地占总耕地的百分之四十六）而强调群众落后不愿多种，对任务没信心完成。还有部分干部因评改结束，建政停止而产生了松一口气的想法，晋县四区干部在民主建政工作时，情绪非常高，有的干部带病坚持工作，近来一听建政停止，立刻大显松懈，赶集闲转，有病的更不下乡了。因之，当前春耕种棉工作形成严重的自流状态。必须加强思想领导，进行扭转，要足够认识种棉时间迫近眉睫。全区干部要为完成二百万亩棉田任务而奋斗。
