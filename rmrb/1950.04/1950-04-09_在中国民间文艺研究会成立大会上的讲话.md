Comrades,

Today, as the Folk Literature Research Association is established, Chairman Zhou Yang wants me to say a few words. I feel very apprehensive: First, lately I seem to have become a frog leaping onto dry land, focusing on scientific administration and driving literature out of my mind. Asking me to talk about literature today feels quite unfamiliar. Second, to be honest, I used to look down on folk literature, considering it low-level and vulgar. It wasn't until 1943, when I read Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, that I was enlightened and realized that it was wrong to take a dismissive attitude towards mass literature and art. After that, I gradually began to value and cherish folk literature. However, even now, I haven't done any in-depth research, let alone written anything. Unlike Mr. Zhong Jingwen, who is a folk literature researcher, or Mr. Lao She, who is a folk literature writer, I am nothing and have nothing to say.

Folk literature covers a wide range, including various arts besides literature. It is impossible for me to express a comprehensive opinion. However, if we look back at the history of Chinese literature, we can find that the most basic, most vivid, and most abundant part of the Chinese literary heritage is folk literature or works of folk literature that have been processed.

The oldest collection of poetry is the "Book of Songs," which includes "Guofeng" (Airs of the States), "Daya" (Major Odes), "Xiaoya" (Minor Odes), and "Songs" (Zhou, Lu, Shang). "Guofeng" were folk songs and ballads of the time (late Spring and Autumn period, early Warring States period). "Daya" and "Xiaoya" were mainly court literature of the Zhou Dynasty, "Zhou Songs" were hymns of the Zhou Dynasty used to worship gods, "Lu Songs" were hymns of praise used for sacrifices in the State of Lu, and "Shang Songs" were sacrificial songs of the Song Xianggong era, also aristocratic literature. Therefore, of the entire "Book of Songs," only "Guofeng" came from the people, while "Ya" and "Song" were aristocratic literature and court literature. But comparatively, the value of "Guofeng" far exceeds that of "Ya" and "Song." In other words, the value of folk literature far exceeds that of aristocratic and temple literature and court literature.

Then there is the well-known "Chu Ci" (Songs of Chu). Qu Yuan wrote "Li Sao" (The Lament) by adopting and developing folk literary forms. Some other works were also folk literature, processed by Song Yu, Jing Cha, and others. This proves that folk literature that has been properly processed is the most valuable and has the longest life.

The "fu" (rhapsody) that the Han Dynasty was so proud of was actually a rigid, lifeless thing like two large doors, even more worthless than the eight-legged essays of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The most valuable legacy of the Han Dynasty is the "Yuefu" (Music Bureau ballads). And the "Yuefu" is precisely the poetry that came from the people. The artistic level they reached is something that poets today cannot achieve.

The Six Dynasties were characterized by the prevalence of parallel prose, but these things have no value today. What is valuable is the folk literature, especially the "Ziye Songs" and "Bamboo Branch Songs" that were popular in the Southern Dynasties. These works are all very beautiful and very moving.

Let's jump ahead a big step and see the dramatic rise of Yuan Dynasty drama. It was a sudden climax in the history of Chinese literature. There are many Yuan operas extant, and most of them are very valuable. The rulers of the Yuan Dynasty were a foreign people who did not yet know how to use literature and art as tools to rule the people. The literati could not get close to them, so they had to seek from below, creating works aimed at the people, which made folk literature bloom with wonderful colors, still having great appeal today. Ming and Qing novels such as "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are all great achievements in the history of Chinese literature, created by inheriting folk traditions such as bianwen (narrative poems) and pinghua (storytelling).

"Guofeng," "Chu Ci," "Yuefu," folk songs of the Six Dynasties, Yuan operas, and Ming and Qing novels—these are the true orthodoxy of Chinese literature. What were previously considered orthodox have in fact gone astray, and are worthless today.

Today, enlightened by Chairman Mao, we should thoroughly correct the previous erroneous view of despising folk literature. Folk literature is an inexhaustible treasure. Those engaged in literary work should pay special attention to it and study it.

Today, we are establishing the Folk Literature Research Association to conduct in-depth research on ancient and modern Chinese folk literature. I think there are five purposes for our research:

(1) To preserve and disseminate valuable literary heritage. China has a vast territory, and each region has its own unique characteristics. It is essential to collect folk literature scattered throughout the country, preserve it, and disseminate it. I really like the word "feng" (wind) in "Guofeng" (Airs of the States). This "wind" is used so appropriately. Folk songs are like a gust of wind, no one knows who their author is, suddenly they blow up like a gust of wind, and then suddenly they calm down and disappear like a gust of wind. Now we must organize a group of wind catchers to capture and preserve, study, and disseminate the winds that are blowing. In China's five thousand years of history, the work of catching the wind has not been done enough. There have not been many collections like the "Book of Songs." Therefore, many winds have been born and died without leaving a trace. Today, we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past, we cannot let them be born and die on their own.

(2) To learn the advantages of folk literature. We collect folk literature not purely for the sake of appreciating it as a work of art, or even worshiping it as an idol, but to find its advantages and learn from them. In poetry, we must learn its techniques and grammar for expressing the emotions of the people, and learn its rhythm and syllables. At the same time, we can also use folk elements to transform ourselves. The standpoint of folk art is the people, the object is the people, and the attitude is to serve the people. All who love the people are protected, and all who oppose the people are opposed. Our writers should learn from folk literature to correct their own creative standpoints and attitudes.

(3) To accept folk criticism and self-criticism from folk literature. Literature is not only a reflection of real life, but also an evaluation and critique of real life. Folk literature, whether explicitly or implicitly, contains criticism of the society at the time, especially of politics. Therefore, today, when we study folk literature, we should not only focus on its literary value, but also pay attention to the political opinions of the masses contained within it. Today, we all need to engage in self-criticism, and we also need to collect the opinions of the masses. Folk literature provides a lot of material for this. Folk literature is a mirror that reflects the face of politics. This principle is not a discovery of today; the ancients also had this insight. Ancient rulers sent poetry collectors to collect poems and play them in the court, in order to investigate the hardships of the people. Whether this actually happened is uncertain, but at least some people had this idea. In music, the ancients also knew that "examining music reveals politics," examining the clarity or tyranny of politics from the joy or resentment of folk music. We should not simply appreciate folk literature as an art form, learn it as a literary form, but also use the folk mirror to reflect on ourselves.

(4) Folk literature provides historians with the most accurate historical materials of society. In the past, scholars only read the "Twenty-Four Histories" and some official or quasi-official historical materials. But we know that folk literature is the most authentic and valuable firsthand material for studying history. Therefore, we must stand from the perspective of studying the history of social development and studying history to make good use of it.

(5) To develop folk literature. We must not only collect, preserve, study, and learn folk literature, but also improve and process it, so that it can be developed into a new socialist literature and art with a national form. In the history of China, long-circulating literary arts, such as “Li Sao”, Yuan operas, and novels, are all the result of processing folk literature. This is a good inspiration for us. The ultimate goal of studying folk literature today is to process, improve, and develop folk literature in order to create a new democratic literature and art with a national form.

### 在中国民间文艺研究会成立大会上的讲话

1950-04-09
第5版()
专栏：

　　在中国民间文艺研究会成立大会上的讲话各位同志：
    今天民间文艺研究会成立，主席周扬同志要我来讲几句话。我感到非常惶恐：第一、这些日来我好像是青蛙跳上了干坎，专心搞科学行政的工作，把文艺从脑子里赶了出去，叫我今天来谈文艺，实在有些生疏；第二、说实话我过去是看不起民间文艺的，认为民间文艺是低级的、庸俗的。直到一九四三年读了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会的讲话，这才启了蒙，了解到对群众文学、群众艺术采取轻视的态度是错误的。在这以后渐渐重视和宝贵民间文艺。可是直到现在还没有做过深入的研究，更没有写过什么东西，不像在座的钟敬文先生是民间文艺的研究家，老舍先生是民间文艺的写作家，我什么也不是，也说不出什么。
    民间文艺包括范围很广，文学之外还有各种艺术。如果要我全面地来发表意见，是不可能的事。但如果回想一下中国文学的历史，就可以发现中国文学遗产中最基本、最生动、最丰富的就是民间文艺或是经过加工的民间文艺的作品。
    最古的诗集是《诗经》，其中包括国风、大小雅、三颂（周、鲁、商）。国风是当时（春秋末，战国初）的民歌民谣，大雅小雅主要是周代的宫廷文学，周颂是周朝祭神的颂歌，鲁颂是鲁国祭祀的赞美诗，商颂是宋襄公时代的祭祀之謌，也是贵族文学。所以一部诗经，只有国风是来自民间的，雅、颂都是贵族文学、宫廷文学。但是比较起来，国风的价值远超过雅、颂。也就是说民间文学的价值远超过贵族化的宗庙文学、宫廷文学。
    再说到众所周知的《楚辞》。屈原写《离骚》是采取了民间的文艺形式而又发展了的。其他有些也是民间文艺作品，经过宋玉、景差等人加工的。这证明了经过正当地加工的民间文学是最有价值的，是有最长的生命的。
    两汉引以自傲的赋，实际上是一种像两扇大门一样死板的，比明清的八股还要没有价值的东西。两汉遗留给我们的最有价值的是乐府。而乐府正是从民间来的诗歌。它们所达到的艺术水准，现在的诗人还达不到。
    六朝盛行骈文，但是这些东西在今天已没有价值。有价值的是民间的，尤其是在南朝流行的《子夜歌》、《竹枝词》等。这些作品都是非常佳妙的，非常动人的。
    再往下跳跃一大步吧，可以看到奇峰突起的元朝戏剧。在中国文学史上是个突然的高潮。现存的元曲数量很多，大都是很有价值的。元朝的统治者是个外来民族，还不知道利用文学艺术作为统治人民的工具。一般文人巴结不上，只得下求，创作以人民为对象的作品，使民间文艺开放了奇花异彩，至今仍具有很大吸引力。明清小说如《水浒》、《西游记》、《三国演义》等，都是承袭了民间的传统如变文、评话等创作出来的中国文学史上的伟大成就。
    国风、楚辞、乐府、六朝的民歌、元曲、明清的小说，这些才是中国文学真正的正统。以前认为是正统的那些，事实上有许多是走入了斜道的，在今日已经毫无价值的东西。
    今天，经过了毛主席的启示，我们应当彻底改正以前鄙视民间文艺的错误观点。民间文艺是无尽的宝藏。从事文艺工作的人应当特别重视它，并且加以研究。
    我们今天成立民间文艺研究会，就是要对中国古代和现代的民间文艺进行深入的研究。我们研究的目的，我想到的有五点：
    （一）保存珍贵的文学遗产并加以传播。中国幅员广大，各地有各地方的色彩，收集散在各地的民间文艺再加以保存和传播，是十分必要的。我很喜欢《国风》这个“风”字，这“风”用得真是不能再恰当了。民歌就是一阵风，不知道它的作者是谁，忽然就像一阵风地刮了起来，又忽然像一阵风地静止了，消失了。我们现在就要组织一批捕风的人，把正在刮着的风捕来保存，加以研究和传播。在中国五千年的历史上，捕风的工作是做得很不够的，像《诗经》这样的搜集就不多。因此有许多风自生自灭，没有留下一点踪迹。今天我们不能重蹈覆辙，不能再让它自生自灭了。
    （二）学习民间文艺的优点。我们搜集了民间文艺，并不是纯粹为了当做艺术品来欣赏，甚至奉为偶像，而是要去寻找它的优点来学习。在诗歌，要学习它表现人民情感的手法语法，学习它的韵律，音节。同时，还可以借民间的东西来改造自己。民间艺术的立场是人民，对象是人民，态度是为人民服务。凡是爱人民的即爱护之，反对人民的即反对之。我们的作家应当从民间文艺中学习改正自己创作的立场和态度。
    （三）从民间文艺里接受民间的批评与自我批评。文艺不仅是现实生活的反映，而且是现实生活的评价与批判。民间文艺中，或明显的、或隐晦的包含着对当时社会，尤其是政治的批评。所以今天我们研究民间文艺不单着眼在它的文学价值，还要注意其中所包含的群众的政治意见。今天我们大家都要有自我批评，更要收集群众意见。在民间文艺中就提供了不少材料。民间文艺是一面镜子，照出政治的面貌来。这个道理，并不是今天才发现的，古人也早已有此见解。古代统治者派遣采诗官，采集诗歌在朝廷演奏，借以调查民间疾苦。这种事是否的确有，不能确定，但至少有人有过这种想法。在音乐方面，古人也知道“审乐而知政”，从民间音乐的愉悦或抑愤中考察政治的清明或暴虐。我们不好单把民间文艺当作一种艺术来欣赏，一种文学形式来学习，还必须借民间的镜子来照照自己。
    （四）民间文艺给历史家提供了最正确的社会史料。过去的读书人只读一部二十四史，只读一些官家或准官家的史料。但我们知道民间文艺才是研究历史的最真实、最可贵的第一把手的材料。因此要站在研究社会发展史、研究历史的立场来加以好好利用。
    （五）发展民间文艺。我们不仅要收集、保存、研究和学习民间文艺，而且要给以改进和加工，使之发展成新民主主义的新文艺。在中国历史上长久流传的文学艺术，如《离骚》、元曲、小说等，都是利用民间文艺加工的。这对我们是个很好的启示。今天研究民间文艺最终目的是要将民间文艺加工、提高、发展，以创造新民族形式的新民主主义的文艺。
