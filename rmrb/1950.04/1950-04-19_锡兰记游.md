　　Travel Notes on Ceylon
    By Fú Xī Níng, Abridged translation by Lín Hǎi
    Editor's Note: In January of this year, the foreign ministers of the British Commonwealth held a meeting in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, in an attempt to strengthen the suppression of the Asian national liberation movement. At that time, the newspapers controlled by monopoly capital spared no effort in describing Ceylon as "paradise on earth." How do the people of Ceylon, nominally a "Dominion of the British Empire" but in essence still a colony, live in poverty? How do they wage a heroic struggle against the British imperialist colonizers? We can get a clear answer from this travelogue by Fú Xī Níng.
    The island of Ceylon is located in the Indian Ocean at the southern tip of the Hindustan Peninsula. Imperialists are attempting to use Ceylon as their main base at the gateway to Malaya, Indonesia, and Burma. At the Colombo Conference, they painstakingly emphasized that Ceylon is no longer a colony but a dominion, a so-called "independent and equal" member of the British Commonwealth. Newspapers controlled by monopoly capital spoke of Ceylon as paradise on earth when discussing the conference.
    Not long ago, we visited Ceylon and saw with our own eyes what life is like for the nearly seven million residents there. We also saw what tasks British imperialism has assigned to this island in its plans. Ceylon is today, as it was before, a British colony.
    It was a clear morning when our steamer arrived in Colombo and slowly entered the harbor surrounded by several cement breakwaters. Colombo is located on the busy route from Europe to the Far East, and it is a port of world importance. Ships flying the flags of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and India were docked there.
    Colombo has a population of about 300,000, but the streets are very quiet. There are no trams or buses, only the occasional car or truck passing by. However, long lines of rickshaws are everywhere, and everywhere you can see coolies carrying heavy loads, walking heavily through the slums.
    The diversity of nationalities is surprising to visitors. The native inhabitants are Ceylonese, but there are also Tamils from southern India, as well as Arabs and Malays. The Europeans there are mainly British. The Ceylonese number about four million and are mainly engaged in agriculture and trade. Of the one and a half million Tamils, most work on farms owned by Europeans and some Ceylonese. Europeans number only twelve thousand. But in reality, all the wealth of Ceylon is concentrated in their hands.
    Many signs and inscriptions of government offices, shops, and hotels are in English. Most street and square names are derived from English, and some are Portuguese and Dutch.
    The British East India Company sent teams of armed expeditions to various parts of the island, north and south. By the early nineteenth century, Ceylon had become a British colony. The British colonial authorities extended their reach to all parts of the island, levying heavy taxes on the people. They used armed forces to drive away the indigenous inhabitants, seized their land, and planted coffee, cinchona, tea, and, finally, rubber.
    The Ceylonese refused to work for the British, so the British imported cheap labor from India – Tamil coolies.
    With rifles and the foremen's pistols and whips, Ceylon was turned into a typical British colony, a subsidiary of capitalist Britain producing agricultural raw materials. For the capitalists of London, Ceylon was first a source of tea and later of rubber. Rubber plantations gradually squeezed out other crops (including rice), and due to the one-sided development of agriculture, the lack of food became a long-term disaster for the people of the island.
    This is the sad history of this "paradise." The British authorities held complete power over Ceylon, and the local people had no basic political rights. It was not until 1909 that an organization resembling a representative government – the so-called Legislative Council – appeared under the pressure of the growing liberation movement. In 1919, local landlords and the bourgeoisie founded Ceylon's first political party – the Ceylon Indian Congress. Afterwards, the British authorities made another "concession," allowing three representatives of the bourgeoisie and landlords to participate in the Executive Council under the governor. A constitution was promulgated in 1931. This was a typical colonial constitution, which allowed a State Council to be elected by the wealthy upper classes of the people, but all civil and military power remained in the hands of the governor.
    Before the end of World War II, British rule in Ceylon remained unshaken. But after World War II, a huge wave of national liberation movements began in the colonies and dependencies of Asia. The broad masses of the people demanded improved living conditions and sought democratic freedoms.
    At this time, the suffering of the Ceylonese people reached its extreme. The cost of living increased threefold, but wages remained at pre-war levels. There was also a shortage of food. The British authorities also further reduced food imports in order to save money.
    Ceylon's economy was in its most severe difficulties. Disappointment grew daily. Under the leadership of the Ceylon Federation of Labour (founded in 1940) and other progressive organizations, rubber plantation, dock, and civil service workers went on strike. The possibility of united action by the people emerged. This severely alarmed the bourgeoisie and landlords. In March 1945, the State Council requested the British government to grant Ceylon dominion status. The British authorities thought it wise to deal with local planters and employers, who had by then established the United National Party.
    On September 26, 1947, the British Governor Sir Moore held a swearing-in ceremony in Ceylon for the "National Government," headed by Senanayake (Prime Minister – translator's note), a leader of the United National Party with close ties to British interests.
    The first agreement signed by this government was with Britain in November 1947. The agreement allowed the British authorities to build naval and air bases in Ceylon and set up countless other military facilities, barracks, etc. Following this very important agreement, on February 4, 1948, Ceylon was declared an "independent and autonomous" dominion of the British Empire. This "pearl hanging from Hindustan" got a new official title, but it was still ruled by the British King as before. The British government retained full power over Ceylon's internal and foreign affairs. Sir Moore remained governor until recently when he was replaced by Soulbury. English is still the official language. British troops are stationed on the island as before, at British naval bases and elsewhere. British soldiers and officers are often seen in Colombo, apparently feeling like they are the masters there.
    Ceylon's economy has made no progress at all. Industrial development is very poor, with only a few small factories and tea and rubber processing plants. Ceylon has only one machine manufacturing factory in Colombo, which manufactures tools needed for tea plantations. It belongs to the British Colombo Commercial Company. British capitalists own almost all the tea and rubber plantations and control Ceylon's foreign trade. For example, Ceylon must buy all its sugar through Britain and can only sell tea to British companies, which then ship it overseas to sell at high prices. The countries of the British Empire (mainly Britain itself) account for 58 percent of Ceylon's exports and 55 percent of its imports. British capitalists extract Ceylon's industrial raw materials (graphite, rubber, coconut copra, and coconut husk) and food (tea, coffee, cocoa, and vegetable oil) and sell their manufactured goods at high prices in the Ceylon market.
    Since the war, American merchants have wanted to get their hands on Ceylon's wealth. They buy large quantities of rubber and graphite. In Ceylon's foreign trade, the United States ranks only second to Britain. In 1948, American goods imported into Ceylon reached three times the pre-war figure. Various American "experts," "advisers," and "investigators" are increasingly appearing in Ceylon. Wall Street is stretching its greedy claws towards the Ceylon "pearl" on the British crown.
    The artificial gap between low export prices and high import prices caused Ceylon's foreign trade balance to have a deficit of 56 million rupees in 1948 for the first time in ten years. Britain's war debt of 51 million pounds placed a heavy burden on Ceylon's finances. London's banks have "frozen" large sums of money loaned to Ceylon. This is another means by which the British government controls Ceylon's economic and political affairs.
    The unbalanced economy of this colony, so ruthlessly exploited by the imperialists, makes Ceylon far from a paradise for the working people. In the streets of Colombo, one often sees people on the verge of death from hunger, their emaciated bodies covered in ragged clothes. The situation in the suburbs where the working people live is even more miserable. There you cannot see the luxurious European-style buildings that line the main streets of the city center. Ordinary Ceylonese live in mud houses covered with palm leaves. There are no windows, and the only source of light is the door. The stove is on the ground, and because there is no chimney, the house is filled with smoke. A few clay pots, baskets, and tin cans are the household utensils.
    Life is so hard for the poor in the city, but the suffering of the rural population, which accounts for the vast majority, is even more severe. Landless and land-poor farmers must give most of their harvest to the landlords as rent for small plots of land. They are bankrupted by heavy taxes and become agricultural laborers toiling on tea and rubber plantations. The fate of these people is one of hardship. The situation of the Tamils is even more terrible. The average wage of an adult Tamil worker is, at best, only two to two and a half rupees a day – just enough to buy a handful of rice. The fate of the workers is completely in the hands of the foremen. But the workers desperately cling to their existing jobs – because there are more than 300,000 people unemployed on this small island.
    Most of Ceylon's Tamils were born on the island and have severed all ties with India. However, they still do not receive the slightest bit of the rights enjoyed by Ceylonese workers. The Indian Residents Citizenship Act passed by the Senanayake government in August 1948 excluded more than 800,000 Indian workers from the scope of the law in one fell swoop.
    The rule of British planters and their lackeys in the Senanayake government is arousing increasing resistance from the people. On the eve of the declaration of Ceylon's "independence," workers in Colombo went on strike, demanding basic democratic rights and better living conditions. The authorities dealt with the strikers barbarously. Thousands were fired from their jobs, and hundreds were thrown into prison. The government and employers are constantly at war with the trade unions. Even so, at the end of 1948, strikes flared up violently again, with thousands of plantation workers stopping work. Last May Day, the Communist Party and other workers' parties held a grand mass meeting in Colombo under the slogan of uniting the working people to fight against imperialism and capitalist exploitation.
    On January 14th of this year, the All-Ceylon Congress for Peace was held in Colombo, attended by 2,000 delegates representing all sectors of society. Police were ordered to take all measures to prevent the people from expressing their opposition to the arms race, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the imperialist plot to suppress the Asian national liberation movement. During the British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference, Colombo's main streets were guarded by armed police.
    But the voice of the people cannot be covered up. The voice of the people is loud and strong, denouncing the Colombo Conference as a warmongering plot. The delegates of the All-Ceylon Congress for Peace called on all working people, on all the people of Ceylon, to strengthen the united front for peace and democracy.
    The growth of Ceylon's democratic forces cannot be stopped by the Senanayake government.

　　锡兰记游
    弗辛宁作  林海节译
    编者按：今年一月间，大英联邦的外长们，曾在锡兰的首都科伦坡开过一次企图强化镇压亚洲民族解放运动的会议。当时为独占资本所控制的报纸曾不遗余力地把锡兰描述成“人间的天堂”，究竟这个在名义上已成为“大英帝国的自治领”而实质上仍然是殖民地的锡兰，那里的人民如何在贫困中生活？他们如何与英帝国主义的殖民者作英勇斗争？我们可以从弗辛宁这篇旅行通讯得到一个明确的回答。
    锡兰岛位于印度斯坦半岛南端的印度洋中。帝国主义者正企图把锡兰作为他们在马来亚、印度尼西亚和缅甸之入口处的主要基地。在科伦坡会议上，他们煞费苦心地强调说，锡兰不再是殖民地而是自治领了，是所谓大英联邦中的一个“独立与平等的”成员。独占资本所控制的报纸谈及会议时把锡兰说成人间天堂。
    不久以前，我们访问了锡兰，亲眼看到那里将近七百万的居民的生活究竟是怎么样。我们亦看到英国帝国主义的计划中给这海岛指派了什么任务，锡兰今天和从前一样还是英国的殖民地。
    那是一个晴朗的早晨，我们的汽轮到了科伦坡，慢慢地驶进了那几道士敏土防堤围成的海港。科伦坡位于欧洲通远东的繁忙的航路上，它是一个具有世界重要性的港口。飘着英国、美国、法国、荷兰、瑞典和印度的各种旗帜的船只停泊在那里。
    科伦坡人口约三十万，但街道却非常静寂。那里没有电车也没有公共汽车，只偶然地有一部轿车或一辆卡车驶过去。然而，长列的人力车却随处皆是，而且到处可以看到压着重载的苦力们在贫民窟中沉重地走着。
    人口之国籍的繁杂，使访问者感到惊异，土生的居民是锡兰人，但此外还有从印度南部来的坦密耳人，亦有阿剌伯人和马来亚人。那里的欧洲人主要是英国人。锡兰人约有四百万，主要从事农业和贸易。一百五十万坦密耳人中，大部分在欧洲人和有的锡兰人所拥有的农场中工作。欧洲人只有一万二千人。但是实际上锡兰所有的财富都集中在他们手里。
    机关、商店和旅馆的许多招牌和题记都是英文的。街道和广场的名字大多来自英文，有些是葡萄牙文和荷兰文。
    英国的东印度公司派出一队队的武装远队到海岛南北各处。十九世纪初期，锡兰已沦为英国的殖民地了。英国殖民当局伸张到海岛各地，向人民课以重税。他们用武装部队把土著居民赶走，霸占了他们的土地，在那里种植咖啡金鸡钠树、茶，而最后是橡胶。
    锡兰人拒绝给英国人作工，英国人便从印度运来了便宜的劳动力——坦密耳苦力。
    用来福枪和工头的手枪皮鞭，把锡兰变成一个典型的英国殖民地，变成资本主义英国的一个生产农业原料的附属国。对于伦敦城的资本家们，锡兰先是茶叶后来是橡胶的来源。橡胶园渐渐地把其他作物（包括大米）都挤掉了，而由于农业的片面发展，缺乏粮食便成为该岛人民一个长期的灾难。
    这些就是这个“天堂”的可悲的历史。英国当局对于锡兰握有完全的权力，当地人民没有最基本的政治权利。只到了一九○九年，类似代议制政府的组织——所谓立法院——在增长的解放运动的压力之下出现了。一九一九年当地地主和资产阶级创立锡兰第一个政党——锡兰印度人大会。之后英国当局作另一次“让步”，准许三个资产阶级和地主的代表参加在总督下面的行政委员会。一九三一年颁布宪法。这是一个典型的殖民地宪法，它允许由人民中富有的上层阶级选出一个国务委员会，但一切民政和军事的权力却还是留在总督手里。
    在第二次世界大战结束以前，英国在锡兰的统治仍是不动摇的。但在第二次世界大战之后，亚洲的殖民地和附属国开始了民族解放运动的巨浪。人民大众要求改善他们的生活条件和寻求民主的自由。
    这时锡兰人民的苦难达到了极点。生活费增加了三倍，但工资却停在战前的旧有水平上。粮食亦缺乏。英国当局还为了节约，把入口粮食更加削减了。
    锡兰的经济处于最严重的困难中。失望与日俱增。在锡兰劳工联合会（一九四○年成立）和其他进步组织领导之下，橡胶园、船坞工人和公务员都举行罢工。人民的一致行动有出现之可能。这严重地警告了资产阶级和地主。在一九四五年三月，国务委员会要求英国政府给予锡兰以自治领地位。英国当局认为和当地的种植园主与雇主打交道是聪明的，这些人在那时已建立了统一国民党。
    一九四七年九月二十六日，英国总督莫尔爵士在锡兰为“国民政府”举行宣誓就职典礼，这政府以森纳那亚基（总理——译注）为首，他是统一国民党的一个领袖，与英国利益密切联系。
    这政府所签订的第一个协定，是一九四七年十一月与英国缔结的。该协定允许英国当局在锡兰建筑海空军基地和设置无数的其他军事设备、兵营等。继这非常重要的协定之后，一九四八年二月四日锡兰被宣布为大英帝国的一个“独立与自治的”自治领。这颗“挂于印度斯坦的珍珠”得到了一个新的正式称号，但它还是和从前一样为英国国王所统治。英国政府保留对锡兰内政外交上的充分权力。莫尔爵士依然是总督，直到最近才换了苏尔贝利。英文还是正式文字。英国军队和从前一样地驻在岛上，驻在英国海军基地和其他地方。在科伦坡亦常常看到英国的士兵和军官，他们显然觉得自己是那里的主人。
    锡兰的经济一点没有进展。工业的发展非常可怜，只有几个小工厂和茶叶橡胶加工工厂而已。锡兰只有一个机器制造厂在科伦坡，制造植茶园所需的工具，它属于英国的科伦坡商业有限公司。英国的资本家拥有几乎所有的植茶园和橡胶园，并控制锡兰的对外贸易。例如，锡兰必须经由英国买到所有的糖，并只能把茶卖给英国公司，英国公司再运到海外以高价出卖。大英帝国各国（主要是英国本身）占有了锡兰百分之五十八的出口和百分之五十五的入口。英国资本家吸取了锡兰的工业原料（石墨、橡胶、椰子肉干和椰子皮）和食品（茶叶、咖啡、可可和植物油），并把他们的制成品以高价在锡兰市场上出卖。
    战争以来，美国商人想染指锡兰财富。他们大量购买橡胶和石墨，在锡兰的对外贸易上，美国的地位仅次于英国。一九四八年输入锡兰的美国货物达到战前数字的三倍。美国的各种“专家”、“顾问”和“调查员”越来越多地出现于锡兰。华尔街正向着英国皇冠上的锡兰“珍珠”伸出其贪婪的利爪。
    低廉出口品价格与高昂入口品价格之间的人为的距离，使得锡兰的对外贸易收支，于一九四八年，在十年中，头一次有了五千六百万卢比的赤字。英国五千一百万镑的战债，对锡兰的财政加上一个沉重的负担。伦敦城的银行已“冻结”了贷予锡兰的大宗款项。这是英国政府控制锡兰经济政治事务之另一个手段。
    被帝国主义者如此无情剥削的这个殖民地的不平衡的经济，使得锡兰对于劳动人民全然不是一个天堂。在科伦坡的街道上，人们常常看到因为饥饿而频于死亡的人，他们瘦削的身体盖着褴褛的衣裳。劳动人民所居住的城郊的情况更加凄惨。在那里你看不到排列在城中心大街上的奢侈的欧式建筑。普通的锡兰人住于盖着棕榈叶的土房子。没有窗户，光线的唯一来源是房门。炉子就在地上，因为没有烟筒，房子里烟云弥漫。几个土罐子、篮子和锡罐便是家里的用具。
    城里的穷人生活是如此艰苦，而占绝大多数的农村人口的灾难则更加深重。无地和少地的农民必须把收获的大部交给地主作为小块土地的地租。他们被苛税弄得破产了，都当农业雇工在植茶园和橡胶园做苦工。这些人的命运是困苦的。坦密耳人的情况更是可怕。一个成年的坦密耳工人的平均工资最好的只有每天两个到两个半卢比——这只够买一把米而已。工人的命运完全操诸工头手中。可是工人们还是拚命地抓住现有的职业不放——因为这个小小的海岛就有了三十万以上的人失业。
    锡兰的多数坦密耳人都生于本岛，与印度断绝了一切关系。然而他们还是得不到锡兰人的工人所享有的一点点权利。森纳那亚基政府于一九四八年八月通过的印度居民公民权法案，一举就把八十万以上的印度工人排斥于法律的范围之外。
    英国种植园主和他们的从仆们在森纳那亚基政府中的统治，正激起人民日渐增加的反抗。在宣布锡兰“独立”前夕，科伦坡工人举行了罢工，要求基本民主权利和较好的生活条件。当局野蛮地对付罢工者，几千人被开除工作，几百人被投入监狱。政府与雇主经常对工会宣战。即令如此，一九四八年末，罢工又猛烈燃烧起来了，几千个种植园雇工，停止了工作。去年五一节，共产党和其他的工人政党在团结劳动人民进行反对帝国主义和资本家剥削的斗争的口号下，在科伦坡举行了盛大的群众大会。
    今年一月十四日科伦坡举行了全锡兰争取和平大会，出席者有代表各界的二千个代表。警察奉命采取各种措施阻止人民表示他们反对扩军、反对北大西洋公约、反对帝国主义者镇压亚洲民族解放运动之阴谋。大英联邦外长会议期间，科伦坡主要街道都有武装警察警戒。
    但是，人民的声音是掩盖不了的。人民的声音既响亮又坚强，斥责科伦坡会议为战争贩子的阴谋。全锡兰争取和平大会的代表们号召一切劳动人民，号召锡兰的全体人民，加强争取和平与民主的统一战线。
    锡兰民主力量的成长森纳那亚基政府是无法阻止的。
