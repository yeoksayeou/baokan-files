Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 18th: Spring plowing and production movements have been widely launched in East China around the time of Qingming Festival. In the water paddy areas of over ten counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, the fields have mostly been plowed three to four times. In southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, southern Anhui, and northern Anhui, the work of plowing, irrigating, repairing ridges, making field embankments, cultivating rice seedlings, and sowing early-maturing crops is also being carried out intensively.

While carrying out spring plowing, farmers in various places are actively engaged in water conservancy construction and topdressing wheat fields. Millions of laborers are participating in massive water conservancy projects such as the Yangtze and Huai River embankment restoration, the Yi and Shu River management, the spring repair of sea dikes in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, the spring repair of the Yellow River, and the diversion of the Si River. Farmers in over a hundred counties in Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, southern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui are carrying out small-scale water conservancy construction projects such as digging ditches, repairing canals, repairing sluice gates, and building dams. In Fuyang County and two other counties in northern Anhui alone, one million laborers are participating in ditch digging, and over 2,800 ditches have been completed. Topdressing of wheat fields has generally been more successful than in previous years in most areas. In Shandong, many counties had already hoed the wheat once or twice in March. In Huang County, 88% of the 500,000 mu of wheat fields have been topdressed. In Rudong County (newly established, eastern Rugao) in northern Jiangsu, the 43,000 dan of fertilizer applied to wheat fields this spring is equivalent to the total amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields throughout the year last year. Wheat fields in Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and other places have generally been hoed two to three times. As a result of diligent hoeing and topdressing, wheat seedlings in most areas are growing very vigorously this year.

Because local people's governments have paid attention to widely organizing labor, advocating mutual aid and borrowing, issuing necessary agricultural loans, and promptly solving farmers' difficulties in lacking labor, animal power, seeds, and fertilizers, the progress of the spring plowing and production movement in East China has been quite rapid. For example, after the completion of the organization of 88,400 mutual aid teams and labor exchange teams in the central and southern Shandong region and their entry into spring plowing, 65% of the spring fields in the entire region were plowed within one month from late February to late March.

In new areas such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and southern Jiangsu, after the government extensively publicized production policies, suppressed rumors and sabotage activities by bandits and special agents, and corrected certain deviations from policies such as forced borrowing and "eating from the big households," the production morale of the broad masses of farmers has become increasingly stable. In many places, borrowing and lending relationships have been initially established, and farmers' difficulties in obtaining grain and seeds for spring plowing have been resolved. For example, in Liyang County, southern Jiangsu, over 1,300 households lent out a total of 40,000 jin of rice to farmers lacking food as rations for spring plowing. In Zhuji County, Zhejiang, farmers solved the difficulties of lacking seeds and fertilizers through free lending and borrowing, and initially implemented mutual aid in labor and cattle exchange, enabling more than 85% of the county's spring fields to be plowed.

The people's governments in disaster areas such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Shandong, and southern Anhui have mostly distributed spring agricultural loans and spring plowing relief grain. On the basis of the initial stabilization of the disaster situation, they have continued to implement the policy of closely combining spring plowing production with water control and disaster relief, and have organized all male and female laborers to implement mutual aid and labor exchange in spring plowing, water control, and sideline occupations, so that spring plowing production can be carried out smoothly. For example, after the farmers in 16 villages in Shaolou Township, Dangshan County (formerly under Jiangsu, now under northern Anhui), implemented a mutual aid method combining spring plowing, sideline occupations, and water control at the beginning of March, they had plowed 1,500 mu out of 1,800 mu of spring fields in the entire township by the end of March.

In order to better promote and guide the smooth development and completion of the spring plowing production movement in various places, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the East China Military and Political Committee dispatched nine spring plowing work teams to Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and other places on the 5th of this month. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office also dispatched two spring plowing inspection teams to cooperate with the East China Agriculture and Forestry Department's spring plowing work teams. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also formed two spring plowing inspection teams at the beginning of April and went to Jiaxing and Ningbo to conduct typical inspections.

　　华东紧张进行春耕
    新区农民生产情绪日益稳定
    【本报讯】据新华社上海十八日电：华东各地的春耕生产运动，已在清明前后普遍展开。苏北沿江十余县水田地区大都耕完三遍至四遍，苏南、浙江、福建、皖南、皖北等地的犁田、上水、修埂、打田塍、育植稻苗、播种早熟作物等工作也正在紧张进行。
    与进行春耕工作同时，各地农民积极进行兴修水利和锄麦上追肥等工作。数百万民工参加长江淮河复堤、沂河沭河治导、苏浙沪海塘春修、黄河春修、泗河改道等巨大的水利工程。山东、浙江、福建、苏南、皖北百余县的农民则进行挖沟、修渠、修闸、筑坝等小型水利建设事业，仅皖北阜阳县等三县即有一百万民工参加挖沟，现已挖成二千八百余道。大部地区锄麦上追肥的成绩都超过往年。山东不少县份在三月间即已锄麦一遍至两遍，该省黄县五十万亩麦田中已有百分之八十八施上追肥。苏北如东县（新设县，如皋东部）今春麦田所上的四万三千余担追肥，已等于去年全年麦田的施肥量。浙江、苏南等地的麦田一般也已锄过两遍至三遍。由于勤锄、追肥的结果，今年大部地区的麦苗长得极为茁壮。
    由于各地人民政府注意广泛组织劳动力，提倡互助互借，发放了必要的农业贷款，及时解决了农民缺乏劳力、畜力、种籽、肥料等困难，华东区各地的春耕生产运动的进展相当迅速。如山东鲁中南区八万八千四百余个变工组和换工组整理完毕进入春耕后，二月下旬至三月下旬的一个月内，即耕完全区百分之六十五的春田。
    浙江、福建、苏南等新区，经过政府广泛宣传生产政策、镇压土匪特务的造谣破坏活动、纠正了某些强借和“吃大户”等违犯政策的偏向后，广大农民群众的生产情绪日趋稳定，不少地方已初步沟通了借贷关系，解决了农民春耕时口粮和种籽困难。如苏南溧阳县有一千三百余户借出大米共四万斤，给缺粮农民作为春耕的口粮，浙江诸暨县农民通过自由借贷解决了缺乏种籽、肥料的困难，并初步实行了人牛互助变工，使该县百分之八十五以上的春田都已耕完。
    苏北、皖北、山东、皖南等灾区的人民政府已将春季农业贷款和春耕救济粮大部发放完毕，并在灾情初步稳定的基础上，继续贯彻春耕生产与治水、救灾密切结合的方针，组织了所有男女劳动力，实行春耕、治水、副业的互助变工，使春耕生产得以顺利进行。如皖北砀山县（原属江苏，现划归皖北）邵楼乡十六个村的农民，自三月初实行了春耕、副业、治水相结合的互助办法后，至三月底已将全乡一千八百亩春田耕了一千五百亩。
    为着更好地推动和指导各地春耕生产运动顺利地开展和完成，华东军政委员会农林部已于本月五日派出九个春耕工作组赴山东、苏北等地工作，苏北行署也派出两个春耕检查小组配合华东农林部春耕工作组一同工作，中共浙江省委也于四月初组成两个春耕巡视组，分赴嘉兴、宁波两专区作典型检查。
