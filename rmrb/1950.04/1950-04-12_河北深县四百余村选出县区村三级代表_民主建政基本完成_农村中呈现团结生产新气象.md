Hebei Shen County: Over Four Hundred Villages Elect County, District, and Village-Level Representatives
Basic Completion of Democratic Governance
New Atmosphere of United Production in Rural Areas

[Report from this newspaper] The democratic governance work in Shen County, Hebei Province, has been basically completed, and a new atmosphere of united production has emerged in the rural areas. Since the county convened a meeting of representatives from all sectors and the First First Party Congress in early March, the democratic governance movement has been widely launched. As of the statistics on March 31, among the 436 administrative villages in the county, 407 villages had elected county, district, and village-level representatives. Among them, village government committees have been established in 311 villages; most villages have convened representative meetings, formulated village production plans, and basically completed the village election work. In terms of mobilizing the masses, the participation rate of voters in general villages is above 60 percent, with some reaching 80 to 90 percent, and women account for about 50 percent of the participating voters.

The masses, cadres, and representatives are very pleased with the new regime produced through the village elections, and a new atmosphere of united production has emerged. Under the leadership of the village representative committee and the new village government in Mazhuang Village, Second District, the entire village is discussing the production plan and how to improve production. Currently, 17 villages in the Third District have completed their production plans and submitted them to the district government.

Through this democratic movement, the County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also consolidated the village-level Party organizations, corrected the closed-doorism and sectarianism of some Party member cadres, basically overcame the phenomenon of "separation of Party and government" and "Party replacing the government" at the village level, and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. For example, in Hanzhuang, Fifth District, the government cadres were weak in the past, and their work was not proactive, often relying on the village branch; after this democratic governance, capable cadres from the masses participated in the village government, overcoming the dependence phenomenon.

In the democratic governance process, several problems that urgently need to be solved in mass production have also been discovered. For example, in villages with cotton planting habits, the cadres are satisfied with the surveyed figures and have not actively led the work. After the household-by-household investigation in the village elections, the actual planned planting area of the masses is still far from the task assigned by the district; in villages that are not accustomed to planting cotton, the cadres only shout slogans and do not conduct propaganda and mobilization among the masses. Furthermore, the specific difficulties in the production of revolutionary martyrs' families and the mobilization of women to participate in field production have not received enough attention in the past. In view of this, the County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of district secretaries on April 1 to review the past production leadership and study the editorial of the Hebei Daily on March 29, "Production is the Overriding Central Task," and the instructions of the provincial government, unified their thinking, re-arranged the production work, and are vigorously implementing the task of correcting the spontaneous flow of production in conjunction with the central task of production.

### 河北深县四百余村选出县区村三级代表  民主建政基本完成  农村中呈现团结生产新气象

　　河北深县四百余村选出县区村三级代表
    民主建政基本完成
    农村中呈现团结生产新气象
    【本报讯】河北深县民主建政工作已基本完成，农村中呈现了团结生产的新气象。该县自三月初召开了各界代表会和第一届第一次党代会后，民主建政运动即普遍展开。截至三月三十一日的统计，全县四百三十六个行政村中，已选出县、区、村三级代表的有四百零七个村。其中已建立村政府委员会的有三百一十一个村；大多数村庄已召开了代表会议，制定了村生产计划，基本上完成了村选工作。在发动群众方面，一般村参加选民都在百分之六十以上，多的到百分之八十至九十，而妇女则占参加选民的百分之五十左右。
    经过村选产生了新的政权，群众、干部、代表们都很喜欢，呈现了团结生产的新气象。二区马庄村在村代表委员会和新的村政府领导下，正讨论全村生产计划和如何搞好生产的办法。现全三区已有十七个村做好了生产计划，并将生产计划送到了区政府。
    中共县委会通过这次民主运动，并结合整理了村级党的组织，纠正了某些党员干部的关门主义、宗派主义，基本上克服了村级“党政不分”、“以党代政”的现象，密切了党群关系。如五区韩庄，从前政府干部弱，工作不主动，经常依赖村支部；经过这次民主建政，群众中有能力的干部参加了村政权，克服了依赖的现象。
    在民主建政中，也发现了目前群众生产上亟须解决的几个问题。如：有种棉习惯的村，干部满足于调查的数字，未进行积极领导工作，经过村选中的逐户调查，群众实际计划种植面积，尚与区上分配任务有很大距离；没习惯种棉的村子，干部只空喊完不成，不在群众中进行宣传动员。又如：烈军属生产的具体困难和发动妇女参加田间生产等，过去亦未引起足够注意等。中共县委会有鉴于此，特于四月一日召开了各区书联席会议，对过去的生产领导进行了检讨，并学习了河北日报三月二十九日“生产是压倒一切的中心任务”的社论和省府指示，统一了思想，重新作了生产工作布置，正大力结合以生产为中心的工作任务，贯彻纠正生产的自流现象。
