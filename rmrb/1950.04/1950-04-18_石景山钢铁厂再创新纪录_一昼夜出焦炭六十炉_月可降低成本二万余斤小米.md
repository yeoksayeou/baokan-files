Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Sets New Record
	Sixty Ovens of Coke Produced in One Day and Night
	Monthly Cost Reduction Equivalent to Over 20,000 Jin of Millet

[Report from this newspaper] The "Solvay" coke oven groups A and B at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have created a new record by pushing out sixty ovens of coke in one day and night. As a result of the increased production, compared to the fifty ovens of coke pushed out daily in January, the cost per metric ton of coke has been reduced by three and a half jin of millet, resulting in a monthly cost reduction equivalent to 27,846 jin of millet. According to reports, in January, the total flue and fire channel opening at the bottom of the furnace were readjusted based on workers' opinions, the flue draft was increased, and the furnace temperature gradually increased. At the same time, due to the full use of Kailuan coal, the gas supply was sufficient, and a new record of increasing from 42 ovens to 50 ovens of coke pushed out in one day and night was achieved. At the commendation meeting summarizing this work, the military representative of the branch factory called on everyone to work hard to study how to fill in the missing corners at both ends of the coke to increase production. The workers responded to this call. Furnace tender Li Defu, coke pusher Yuan Shun, Jia Jinxiang, foreman Hao Decheng, and others studied and added movable hinges to the end of the coal leveling rod, so that the coal leveling rod could bring more coal to the missing corner, and the daily output increased from 210 tons to 221 tons. When Soviet engineers visited the factory, they suggested renumbering the furnaces and correcting the coke output sequence. The administration adopted this scientific suggestion, which resulted in a balanced oil tank gas pressure. Although Kailuan coal and Jingxing coal were used in equal proportions in February, the gas supply was still sufficient due to the increased number of ovens, and a record of 51 ovens was achieved on March 1st. At this time, Deputy Engineer Hu Ximing proposed a plan to push out sixty ovens of coke in one day and night. On March 15th, the flue draft was increased again, and the fire pipe baffles were replaced, and the furnace temperature continued to rise. Finally, on the 23rd, a new record of pushing out sixty ovens of coke in 24 hours was created, and the net coking time was shortened from 23 and a half hours to 19 and a half hours. In addition to the special efforts of the furnace tenders, other workers, such as those responsible for coke output, coal loading, lifting furnace doors, and sealing seams, all worked together to ensure that the production plans for January, February, and March were all overfulfilled, and the product quality was not reduced.

　　石景山钢铁厂再创新纪录
    一昼夜出焦炭六十炉
    月可降低成本二万余斤小米
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂“索尔未庆热”式炼焦炉甲乙组炉创造了一昼夜推出六十炉焦的新纪录。由于产量增加的结果，与一月份每日推出五十炉焦相较，每公吨焦炭减低成本三斤半小米，每月可降低成本二万七千八百四十六斤小米。按一月份由于吸收了工人的意见重新调节了总烟道及炉底火道的开度，加大了烟道的吸力，炉温渐增，同时因全部换用了开滦煤，煤气供应充分，一昼夜即由推出四十二炉增至五十炉焦的新纪录。在总结这次工作的评奖大会上，分厂军代表号召大家努力研究补起焦炭的两端缺角，以增加产量。工友们响应了这个号召。看火工友李德福、推焦机工友袁顺、贾金祥、领班郝德成等研究在平煤杆端加上了活动合页，使平煤杆向缺角处多带了煤，日产量由二百一十吨增至二百二十一吨。苏联工程师去该厂参观时，又建议重编炉号，更正出焦次序。行政采纳这一科学的建议，结果使油槽煤气压力平衡，虽然二月份改用了开滦煤、井陉煤各半，煤气因出炉多的关系，仍能充足供应，三月一日达到了五十一炉的纪录。此时，副工程师胡熙明提出了一昼夜推出六十炉焦的计划。三月十五日重新加大了烟道吸力，更换了送火管挡片，炉温继续上升，终于二十三日创造了二十四小时推出六十炉焦的新纪录，净成焦时间由二十三个半小时缩短至十九个半小时。除看火工友特别努力外，其余如出焦、下煤、吊炉门、抹缝等工友都齐心协力动作，保证了一、二、三月份都超额完成生产计划，且产品质量并未降低。（石景山钢铁厂通讯组王恩波）
