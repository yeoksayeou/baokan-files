　　Beijing Grain Company Should Pay Attention to Protecting Warehouse Safety

[This newspaper reported] (Reporter Jin Yu): In the courtyard of a certain warehouse of the Beijing Grain Company, which stores 80 million catties of grain, there are 69 households of family members of employees of the Tianjin Railway Bureau. After the spring warmed up, these households moved their stoves outside to cook or add coal. This is extremely easy to cause a fire. These households also raise a large number of poultry and livestock, often stealing or wasting grain. Half a year ago, the relevant parties discovered this dangerous situation. The Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Trade, and the Tianjin Railway Bureau and Beijing Grain Branch companies have been constantly consulting to get these households to move out, but this has not been resolved to this day.

The warehouse is the largest open-air warehouse of the Beijing Grain Branch Company, covering dozens of acres. At the beginning of the liberation of Beijing, the Military Control Commission allocated it to the company for renovation and use, and obtained housing certificates numbered "Guanfang" 990 and 1125. After taking over, the company successively stored grain. More than 290 people (including children) live scattered in the warehouse. They enter and exit freely, and friends and relatives visit frequently, making it extremely difficult for warehouse guards to manage and supervise the grain. These households also raise more than 100 chickens and a dozen dogs. The chickens often fly onto the piles to eat grain, or burrow under the stacks to peck through the sacks. Grain leaks from the sacks, causing the grain stacks to lose balance, which poses a danger of collapse. What is particularly serious is that since the spring warmed up, the weather has been dry and the materials are brittle. The grain stacks are all covered with reed mats, and the base of the stacks is made of flammable materials such as railway ties and building materials, so there is always a possibility of fire.

Therefore, this reporter believes that in order to avoid this possible disaster, the residents in the warehouse should move out as soon as possible. As for the issues of relocation costs, etc., they should be resolved through consultation between the relevant parties. As long as everyone considers protecting national property, these problems can be easily solved.

　　北京粮食公司应注意保护仓库安全
    【本报讯】记者近宇报道：储有八千万斤粮食的北京粮食公司某仓库院落中，住有天津铁路局员工家属六十九户。这些住户在春暖以后，相率把炉火搬到房外作饭或添煤。这样极易酿成火灾。这些住户还饲养大批家禽家畜，经常偷吃或糟蹋粮食。半年以前，这种险象环生的情况就被有关方面发现了。铁道部、贸易部及天津铁路局、北京粮食分公司等单位为了使这些住户搬出去，曾经不断往返磋商，直到现在仍未解决。
    该仓库是北京粮食分公司最大的露天仓库，占地数十亩。北京解放之初，由军管会拨给该公司修整使用，并领得“管房”字九九○、一一二五号住房证。该公司于接管后即陆续存储粮食。分散居住该库的有二百九十余人（包括小孩）。自己出入，亲友访问，往返杂沓，仓库警卫人员管理、监护粮食极为困难。这些住户又饲养鸡百余只，狗十数头，群鸡时常飞至囤上吃粮，或钻入垛下啄破麻袋。粮食从袋内泄出，粮垛失去平衡，就有倒坍的危险。特别严重的是自春暖以来，天干物燥。储粮囤垛都是以苇席圈盖而成，囤垛基层又是枕木、房料等易燃木料，因而时刻有酿成火灾的可能。
    因此，记者认为：为了避免这种可能发生的灾害，仓库内的住户应该尽速迁出。至于迁移费用等问题，应由有关方面协商解决，只要大家都为保护国家资财着想，这些问题是容易解决的。
