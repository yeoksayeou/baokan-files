　　Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from New York, 27th: TASS, New York, 25th: According to the New York Times, 10,000 machine workers at Western Electric Company, a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph, are on strike. The strike began on the 22nd at several Western Electric plants in protest of the company's dismissal of six workers who refused to work under unbearable conditions. Government "mediators" are trying to prevent a nationwide strike by American Telephone and Telegraph workers scheduled for the 26th, demanding wage increases. Federal Mediation Service representative Stoutel declared that negotiations between company representatives and the union have so far yielded no results. The New York Times said that the strike threatens to spread to 240,000 telecommunications workers in forty-two states.

    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：据纽约时报报道：美国电话电报公司所属西部电力公司已有一万名机件工人在罢工中。罢工于二十二日在西部电力公司的几个工厂开始，抗议资方解雇六名拒绝在不堪忍受的条件下工作的工人。政府的“调停者”力图阻止定于二十六日举行的、要求增加工资的全国电话电报公司工人的罢工。联邦调停局的代表史透特尔宣称：公司代表与工会之间的谈判，迄今还没有结果。纽约时报说：罢工有扩大到四十二州的二十四万电讯工人之势。
