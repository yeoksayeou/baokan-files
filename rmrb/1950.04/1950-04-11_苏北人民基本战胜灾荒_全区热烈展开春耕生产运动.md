Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: Thanks to the development of sideline production, the implementation of work-for-relief programs, the launch of mutual aid campaigns, and the implementation of a policy combining disaster relief with spring planting production, the people in the disaster areas of Northern Jiangsu have basically overcome the severe disaster. A heated spring planting production movement is now unfolding throughout the region. In severely affected areas, it is possible to ensure that no land is left uncultivated, and in lightly affected and non-disaster areas, most people have achieved intensive cultivation. Since Northern Jiangsu suffered from heavy rainfall last autumn, the regional People's Government and the Northern Jiangsu Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to correct the tendency of "caring for people but not for the fields," immediately called on cadres to stay in their posts, lead the disaster victims in disaster relief with all their strength, drain water and replant crops, emphasizing relying on agricultural production for disaster relief and preparedness, and planting more early-maturing crops and substitute foods. In the severely affected areas of Haimen and Qidong, the winter slack season was also used to dredge rivers and ditches and weed three to five times. The spring seedlings are growing very well this year, which is a great comfort and encouragement to the disaster victims. The disaster areas of Northern Jiangsu have also planted more than one million mu of vegetables, each mu yielding about four to five thousand catties of vegetables, which have effectively made up for the shortage of food in the disaster areas.

　　Since the autumn planting season last year, the People's Government has focused on organizing disaster victims to develop sideline production. Because there are many lakes and rivers in Northern Jiangsu, the government put forward the slogan of "relying on water to make a living," organizing disaster victims to catch fish and shrimp and cut grass. In Gaoyou County alone, 160,000 disaster victims participated. Secondly, flour mills were developed, with each mill supporting nearly twenty people's lives. In the Huaiyin area alone, nearly 100,000 disaster victims participated in flour mill production. Other sideline production such as textile weaving, mat weaving, and rush bag making have also achieved considerable results. Trade companies and production promotion agencies have purchased finished products to help open up sales channels.

　　Reasonably Organize Labor for Spring Planting and Spring Repairs

　　In addition to organizing sideline production, the People's Government has also organized the Yi River Diversion and Land Reclamation projects, implementing work-for-relief programs in conjunction with disaster relief, which has also achieved great results. A total of 340,000 migrant workers participated in the projects. Each migrant worker could earn one catty of wage grain per day in addition to food, and a family of four could receive four taels of grain per person per day. Now, in addition to continuing to complete the Yi River Diversion and Land Reclamation projects, 200,000 migrant workers have been mobilized to participate in the spring repair projects of the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River. This will play a greater role in disaster relief. However, with spring planting approaching, how to closely integrate the Yi River Diversion with spring planting production is a major issue in the current disaster relief work. For example, the Huaiyin area needs to mobilize 300,000 migrant workers to divert the Yi River on the one hand, and take care of the local spring planting production on the other, and time is very tight. After research, the Huaiyin Area People's Government decided to solve the labor force contradiction in three ways: First, the earthwork projects for river management are allocated according to the amount of land or labor, and then those without food and cattle are organized to work on the river, and those with food and cattle are organized to cultivate at home on behalf of the river work, implementing the method of equal exchange of river management and spring planting; second, semi-labor force and women are organized as much as possible to participate in spring planting production; third, the masses are mobilized to do river work before the start of spring planting, and then some river workers are returned to participate in production during spring planting to ensure that all spring fields are planted.

　　In the disaster relief efforts, the People's Government also launched a wide range of social mutual aid movements in a timely manner, raising nearly ten million catties of miscellaneous grains, which were distributed to the disaster victims. In carrying out the social mutual aid movement, all localities paid attention to conducting in-depth mobilization, based on the principle of voluntariness, preventing coercion and commandism, so as not to create a dependence mentality among the disaster victims and affect the production enthusiasm of households with surplus grain.

　　苏北人民基本战胜灾荒
    全区热烈展开春耕生产运动
    【本报讯】据新华社上海九日电：由于发展副业生产，实行以工代赈，开展互济运动和实行救灾与春耕生产相结合的方针，苏北灾区人民已基本上战胜了严重的灾荒。现全区已展开热烈的春耕生产运动，重灾区可做到不荒田，轻灾区和非灾区人民已大部做到精耕细作。苏北区自去秋雨水成灾后，该区人民政府和中共苏北区党委为纠正“顾人不顾田”的偏向，即号召干部就地坚持，全力领导灾民救灾，排水补种，强调依靠农业生产救灾备荒，多种早熟作物和代食品。海门、启东重灾区还利用冬闲空隙进行开河疏沟，锄草三遍到五遍。今年春苗长得很好，对灾民更是极大的安慰和鼓励。苏北灾区还种菜一百万余亩，每亩约可产菜四、五千斤，这些春菜有力地弥补了灾区食粮的不足。
    苏北地区自去年秋耕秋种以后，人民政府即以组织灾民开展副业生产为中心工作。因苏北湖河甚多，当时政府即提出靠水吃水的口号，组织灾民捉鱼虾、割草，仅高邮一县参加者即达十六万灾民。其次是发展粉坊，每副粉磨可维持近二十个人的生活，仅淮阴专区参加粉坊生产的灾民即近十万人。其他纺织、编席、打蒲包等副业生产也获得不少成绩。贸易公司、生产推进社曾收购成品，帮助打开销路。
    合理组织劳动力进行春耕和春修
    除组织副业生产外，人民政府还组织导沂、兴垦两工程，实行以工代赈，结合救灾，也收到很大成效。参加工程的民工共达三十四万人，每个民工除吃食外，每天可赚一斤工资粮，四口之家每人每日可得四两粮。现在除继续完成导沂兴垦工程外，还动员民工二十万人参加运河、长江春修工程。这对救灾当有更大作用。但目前春耕将届，如何使导沂和春耕生产密切结合进行，是目前救灾工作中一个重大的问题。如淮阴专区一面要动员三十万民工导沂，一面又要照顾当地的春耕生产工作，时间又很紧迫。淮阴专区人民政府研究结果，决定从三方面解决劳动力的矛盾：一是按田亩或按劳力分配治河土方工程，各地再组织无吃粮无牛力者上河工，有吃粮有牛力者在家代河工耕种，实行治河与春耕等价换工的办法；二是尽量组织半劳动力及妇女参加春耕生产；三是在春耕开始前多动员群众做河工，春耕时再回来一部河工参加生产，以保证春田全部种完。
    在救灾中，人民政府也适时地展开广泛地社会互济运动，共募得杂粮近千万斤，发给灾民。在开展社会互济运动时，各地曾注意进行深入动员，依据自愿原则，防止强迫命令，以免造成灾民的依赖心理和影响有余粮户的生产情绪。
