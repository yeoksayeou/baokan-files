　　邯郸 Prefecture Conducts In-Depth Spring Plowing Inspection
    All Regions Should Strengthen Leadership and Labor Mutual Aid
    [By Our Newspaper] The spring plowing in the Handan Prefecture of Hebei Province has reached a climax. The majority of counties have finished plowing the white land left over from last winter's plowing. The general land has been plowed three or four times. For example, according to statistics from 30 villages in the Second District of Qiu County, out of a total of 58,175 mu of spring land, 44,979 mu have been harrowed more than three times. The cotton fields have been harrowed even more times. In the Fourth District of Feixiang, 41,250 mu of cotton land have been harrowed five times. However, Wang Kecai, a farmer from Anzhai, Guantao, harrowed his seven mu of cotton land nine times. This year, the masses are applying significantly more fertilizer than last year. According to a survey in the Third and Fourth Districts of Handan, each mu of land is being fertilized with half a cart more than last year. According to a survey of only 30 villages in Qiu County, the masses purchased 132,420 pieces of cake fertilizer. The cotton planting plan has been largely implemented down to the household level, and some households are already preparing to plant. Most of the paddy fields have been hoed twice, and a few paddy fields in Cixian have been hoed three times. At the same time, the masses' habit of not hoeing dry land wheat fields has been broken. Three districts in Weixian have hoed 15,688 mu of wheat. During the spring plowing campaign, various counties have put forward resounding slogans: "Plow and fertilize more in the spring plowing, and you won't have to worry about increased production in the autumn." "Planting cotton is like shaking a money tree, and digging a well is like gathering a treasure pot." In order to thoroughly complete the spring plowing, various counties are conducting in-depth mass spring plowing inspections. Qiu County is carrying out a three-check (check harrowing, fertilizing, and plowing, check holding family meetings and making plans, check well digging and cotton planting preparations), four-comparison (compare the number of plowing times, compare fertilizer accumulation and application, compare the quality of family meetings, compare production methods) movement. However, there are still two urgent problems to be solved in the whole region: 1. A few counties have not yet regarded spring plowing as the overriding central task, so that a few districts and villages are not adequately prepared for spring plowing and sowing. In particular, there is insufficient preparation for cotton planting. Therefore, the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has once again instructed that spring plowing is the overriding central task, and the leaders of all counties must seize the opportunity to carry out a major spring plowing inspection to thoroughly complete the spring plowing and prepare for sowing. 2. Insufficient attention has been paid to the organization of labor mutual aid. There are many groups of masses who have spontaneously helped each other throughout the region, but they lack leadership. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the cadres' understanding of organization and strengthen the leadership of mutual aid, so that the masses can gradually organize under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit.

　　邯郸专区深入检查春耕
    各地应加强领导劳动互助
    【本报讯】河北邯郸专区春耕已达高潮。去年冬耕留下的白地多数县已犁完。一般的地已耕过三、四遍。如邱县二区三十个村统计，共有春地五万八千一百七十五亩，耙三遍以上的就有四万四千九百七十九亩。棉花地耙的遍数更多。肥乡四区棉地有四万一千二百五十亩已耙过五遍。而馆陶安寨农民王可财七亩棉花地却耙过九遍。今年群众施肥比去年显著增加，据邯郸三、四区调查，每亩地比去年多施半车肥。仅邱县三十村调查，群众买饼肥即达十三万二千四百二十个。种棉计划大部贯彻到户，有的户已准备点种。水田大部锄过两遍，磁县水田少数已锄过三遍。同时也打破了群众对旱地麦地不锄的习惯。魏县三个区已锄麦一万五千六百八十八亩。在春耕运动中，各县都提出了响亮的口号：“春耕多耙多上粪，秋后增产不用问。”“种棉花好比摇钱树，打井好比聚宝盆。”为了彻底完成春耕，各县正进行深入的群众性春耕检查。邱县正开展春耕的三查（查耙地送粪犁地、查开家庭会订计划、查打井和种棉准备）、四比（比耕地遍数、比积肥施肥、比家庭会开的好坏、比生产办法）运动。但在全区还有两个急待解决的问题：一、有少数县还未把春耕作为压倒一切的中心工作，以致少数区、村对春耕及播种准备还不够。特别是关于种棉准备不够。因此，中共邯郸地委已再次指示春耕是压倒一切的中心任务，各县领导必须抓紧时机开展春耕大检查，使春耕彻底完成，作好播种准备。二、对组织劳动互助注意不够。全区群众自己互助起来的并不少，但缺乏领导，因此要进一步提高干部对组织起来的认识、加强对互助的领导，使群众在自愿互利原则下逐渐组织起来。
