　　Inflation-Adjusted Savings
    Can Be Converted to Principal-Protected, Value-Preserving Deposits or Withdrawn Early
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The People's Bank of China Beijing Branch's recently launched principal-protected, value-preserving fixed deposit savings accounts have been extremely well-received by citizens. From April 15th to 24th, there were already 3,349 depositors, with total deposits reaching 545,000+ units. Many existing inflation-adjusted savings depositors are now requesting to convert to "principal-protected, value-preserving" deposits. To accommodate existing depositors, the bank has stipulated that, effective immediately, existing deposits can be converted to principal-protected, value-preserving deposits at today's (April 26th) inflation-adjusted savings rate (5,280 yuan per unit). Those who wish to convert can complete the procedures at the bank's various departments. Those who do not wish to convert and want to withdraw early can also withdraw at the exchange rate on the day of withdrawal.
