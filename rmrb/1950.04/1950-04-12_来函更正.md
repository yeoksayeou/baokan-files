　　Erratum
    Regarding the results of the dredging of the moat in front of the former three city gates, the amount of mud removed was 111,270 cubic meters. The news released by this office and published in various newspapers on April 6th mistakenly stated it as 18,366 cubic meters. This is hereby corrected.
