　　Government Loans Grain to Support Disaster Victims in Production for Self-Relief
    Ninghe and Baodi Heavily Afflicted Areas Conquer Winter Famine   
    People's Lives Generally Improved; Now Rush-Planting Early-Maturing Crops to Completely Overcome the Famine.
    [Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper correspondent Shu Kai reports: After the widespread launch of the production self-relief movement for two months, the heavily afflicted areas of Ninghe and Baodi in Hebei Province have initially overcome the winter famine, and the people's lives have improved significantly. At present, the region is rushing to plant early-maturing crops, digging rivers and repairing embankments, preparing for spring planting, to lay the foundation for completely overcoming the famine.
    The Ninghe and Baodi region suffered a flood last year, unprecedented in the past decade, with eight heavily afflicted areas. Last autumn, local leaders failed to seize the leadership of disaster victims in production for self-relief, so more than 80 percent of the people lived on bran gruel.
    The Central People's Government is extremely concerned about the disaster victims. Since January, it has allocated a total of 5.39 million catties of disaster relief grain. Wu Xinyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Provincial Government, personally inspected and comforted the disaster areas, instructed the production and disaster relief policies, and encouraged the confidence of the vast number of disaster victims in production and self-relief. In late January, the special district organized a working committee for the heavily afflicted areas, transferred a large number of cadres, and focused on carrying out production and self-relief work.
    First of all, they concentrated their efforts, unified command, mobilized and organized the broad masses of people. Despite the lack of manpower and livestock, they completed the rush transport of a large number of relief grain and cotton on the snowy and muddy ice roads. The eight districts mobilized a total of 630 large carts, 160 small carts, 1,562 ice sleds, and 4,729 laborers, and rushed to transport 7.46 million catties of grain and 150,000 catties of cotton in half a month. Among the masses, they widely publicized the favorable conditions for overcoming the famine and emphasized that only production and self-relief could overcome the famine. They were told to "rely on the mountains to eat mountains, rely on the water to eat water," organize production, "start with the big picture, and start with the small," and call for free lending, turning dead money into active use. Then, various meetings were held to exchange experiences in overcoming the famine. After repeated publicity and the leadership of CCP branch members and skilled workers in various industries, the masses' idea of "waiting for relief" gradually changed. The distribution of grain was deliberated by the village representative meeting, and generally, it was "rapid and reasonable," so that 15 percent of the households received relief and 60 percent of the households received support for production loans. Emphasis was placed on issuing grain while combining it with the organization of production. In the past two months, various sideline productions have developed greatly. According to the eight districts, the number of people engaged in fish management increased from winter management to spring management to 8,545; the number of people weaving mats increased from 890 to 1,795; the number of spinning wheels increased from 5,300 to 12,300. The number of people engaged in transportation and marketing in the four districts increased from 1,980 to 3,688, 500 people worked on river projects, 6,766 people participated in reed cutting and firewood picking (which is a large income), and 1,200 people participated in other sideline occupations. In the ninth district, 3,522 households participated in sideline production, accounting for 86 percent of the total households.
    They seized the planting of early-maturing crops to shorten the famine. Before planting wheat, 1.26 million catties of wheat seeds were distributed, and coarse grains were exchanged for fine grains, and grain loans were used to solve the difficulties of planting land. In the rush planting of 79 wheat, 50 percent of the masses were organized to form mutual aid groups, with people pulling plows. Under the slogan of "No bran after harvesting wheat," many families, old and young, went to the fields to rush planting. More than 30 percent of the young and middle-aged women participated in wheat planting. Many villages in the second and seventh districts raised lamps and borrowed moonlight to rush planting, overcoming the lack of manpower and livestock and various difficulties. By the vernal equinox, in 20 days, 125,000 mu of wheat had been planted in eight districts. Late wheat is now being planted. In order to drain water for planting, the masses in the second district dug 26 ditches in the cold water of early spring, draining 23,000 mu of land.
    At present, the disaster situation has stopped developing. The people's lives have generally improved, and now 30 to 50 percent of households eat pure grain. The sales volume of grain bran in the market, which used to be three times more bran than grain, now accounts for only 20 percent. In the ninth district, except for 600 orphans and widows who still need support, 95 percent of the disaster victims have solved all their livelihood problems from sideline production and past savings. After the thaw, 55 households with 304 people in Hulugu earned 10,000 catties of grain from fish management, and each person received more than 300 catties. Many disaster victims gratefully said, "If it weren't for the concern and help of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, where would we be today!" Many disaster victims still save money and put grain into reproduction. Now the masses have a high enthusiasm for production. Those who manage fish gather and go into the water at dawn, and they persist in fishing even in strong winds and huge waves. Spinning and weaving have also generally improved in output and quality. At present, it is the season for spring plowing, and villages that can be cultivated should immediately start preparing for sowing large fields. In villages that cannot be cultivated, sideline industries should be strengthened. The villages occupied by floodwaters in the Jiyun River flood diversion channel should be planned to be converted into aquatic planting areas, engaged in long-term aquaculture construction, and develop perennial sideline industries such as fish management and weaving. In agricultural and sideline production, it is necessary to organize, form mutual aid groups, and mobilize male and female half-labor forces to participate in production.

　　政府贷粮支持灾民生产自救
    宁宝重灾区战胜冬荒   
    群众生活普遍改善；现正抢种早熟作物，以便完全渡过灾荒。
    【本报讯】本报通讯员书楷报道：河北省宁河宝坻重灾区，经两个月生产自救运动的广泛开展，已初步战胜了冬荒，群众生活显著改善。目前该地区正抢种早熟作物，挖河修堤，准备春种，以打下完全渡过灾荒的基础。
    宁宝地区，去年遭受了十年来未有的水灾，重灾区达八处。去秋当地领导上未能抓紧领导灾民生产自救，因而有百分之八十以上的群众是以糠秕糊口。
    中央人民政府极度关怀着灾民，从一月份以来，共拨给赈贷粮五百三十九万斤，内务部武新宇副部长，省府杨秀峰主席并亲到灾区视察慰问，指示了生产救灾方针，鼓舞了广大灾民生产自救信心。一月下旬，专区组织了重灾区工作委员会，抽调了大批干部，有重点的开展生产自救工作。
    首先集中力量，统一指挥，动员组织广大群众，在人畜力缺乏下，风雪泥泞的冰道上，完成了抢运大批赈贷粮棉。八个区共动员大车六百三十辆、小车一百六十辆、冰床一千五百六十二辆、劳力四千七百二十九人，半月中就抢运粮七百四十六万斤，棉十五万斤。在群众中，广泛宣传渡荒有利条件，并强调指出只有生产自救才能渡过灾荒。要“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”，组织生产，要从“大处着眼，小处着手”，并号召自由借贷。变死财为活用。接着召开了各种会议，交谈了渡荒经验。经过反复宣传，与中共支部党员、各行业能手的带动，逐渐扭转了群众“等待救济”的思想。粮食发放，都经过村代表会的评议，一般的做到了“迅速合理”，使百分之十五的户得到救济，百分之六十的户得到生产贷粮的扶植。贷粮时强调一面发粮，一面结合组织生产，两月来各项副业生产，有巨大发展。按八个区治鱼，由冬治转为春治者八千五百四十五人；织席由八百九十人增到一千七百九十五人；纺线由纺车五千三百辆增到一万二千三百辆。四个区运输运销由一千九百八十人增到三千六百八十八人，五百人作河工，六千七百六十六人参加打苇、拾柴（是很大收入），一千二百人参加其他副业。九区参加副业生产的有三千五百二十二户，占总户百分之八十六。
    他们抓紧早熟作物的种植，以缩短灾荒。种麦前发放麦种一百二十六万斤，并以粗粮换细粮，用牲口贷粮解决了种地困难。在七九麦的抢种中，群众百分之五十组织起来插伙互助，人拉耠子。在“收了麦子不吃糠”的口号鼓动下，很多全家老小下地抢种。百分之三十以上的青壮年妇女，都参加种麦。二、七区很多村黑夜提灯、借月光抢种，战胜了人畜力缺乏与各种困难。到春分止，二十天内，八个区种麦十二万五千亩。现正继续种晚麦。为泄水种地，二区群众，在初春的冷水中，挖沟二十六道，脱地二万三千亩。
    目前灾情已停止发展。群众生活普遍改善，现百分之三十到五十的户吃纯粮。市场粮糠的上销量，过去糠麸比粮多三倍，现糠麸只占十分之二。九区除六百名孤寡尚须扶植外，百分之九十五的灾民，从副业生产与过去的积蓄中，解决了全部生活问题。胡芦沽五十五户三百零四人，自解冻后治鱼，收入粮一万斤，每人分到三百斤以上。很多灾民感激的说：“要不是中央人民政府和毛主席的关心帮助，那会有今天！”很多灾民仍是省吃俭用，把粮食投入再生产。现群众生产情绪很高，治鱼的都是天亮就集合下水，在大风巨浪里也坚持了捕鱼。纺线织席也普遍提高了产量质量。目前已届春耕时节，能耕种的村庄应马上着手准备播种大田。在不能耕种的村庄，则应加强开展副业。对蓟运河分洪道所占积水的村庄，应有计划的改为水区种植，从事长期水产建设，开展治鱼织席等常年副业。在农业副业生产中，必须组织起来，插伙互助，以动员男女整半劳动力，参加生产。
