　　Fully Engage in Spring Plowing and Do Not Abandon Sideline Production
    Disaster-stricken People in Yutian Gradually Have Surplus Grain
    [Our Newspaper] The Tangshan Special District Spring Plowing Inspection Team of Hebei Province arrived in Yutian County, a disaster area of Tangshan Special District, on the 9th of this month. That evening, they listened to the county's report. On the 13th, they held a meeting of the county's main cadres to discuss and arrange future work. The materials prove that the vast disaster areas of Yutian have achieved significant results in spring plowing, sowing, sideline production, and spring labor. The county's twelve districts originally planned to sow 159,543 mu of spring wheat. According to statistics as of April 5, 205,560 mu have been completed, exceeding the original plan by 46,017 mu. Some areas with later water drainage are still continuing to sow. In addition, 7,007 mu of barley have been sown. The vast majority of the county's more than 140,000 mu of autumn wheat has been hoed once or twice. After the wheat seedlings emerged, most of them were ridged, and a few were rolled once. The entire county, except for the newly drained areas that have not yet undergone spring plowing, has been deeply plowed once. Early-maturing crops are about to be planted, and the sowing of large fields has begun. River management laborers have been organized and prepared properly, and the first batch of about 7,000 people have arrived at the river section to work on schedule. In the county's severely affected areas, sideline production such as weaving, knitting, and fishing has also been very profitable. According to statistics from only five severely affected areas, the 4,258 households engaged in fishing have earned 901,331 jin of corn. In the past two months, seven severely affected areas have earned 744,520 jin of corn from weaving cloth and spinning thread, and 214,002.5 jin of corn from weaving mats. Under the policy of "production for overcoming famine," the lives of the vast majority of disaster-stricken people have undergone tremendous changes. The number of families begging in the seven severely affected areas has decreased from more than 1,500 to less than 100. Begging has disappeared in the fourth and eleventh districts, and more than 500 of the original 860 families who fled the famine have returned. The tenth district has also increased its livestock by 23 head. The vast majority of disaster-stricken people have saved three or four dou of grain per household.
  Most of the Land in the Waterlogged Area is Drained
  Masses Should Be Organized to Rush Planting
    However, in the past two months or so, due to the county-level leadership focusing on the leadership of severely affected villages in severely affected areas or lightly affected areas, neglecting the severely affected households in lightly affected villages in lightly affected areas; focusing on agriculture in lightly affected areas, neglecting sideline production, the disaster situation in some lightly affected areas has developed somewhat. According to statistics as of the 5th of this month, the number of begging households in the five lightly affected areas has increased to 512; the number of households eating half grain and half chaff has increased to 3,338. Secondly, cadres at all levels lack a serious concept of abiding by contracts. The county supply and marketing cooperative signed a contract with the special district for 100,000 bolts of native cloth, and although it has been contracted to the district level, and even to some villages, there is a lack of specific inspection and supervision, and some districts have fallen into spontaneous flow. In two and a half months, only more than 63,000 bolts have been completed, losing control over guaranteeing the contract. After inspection, the task was re-adjusted, and efforts were made to realize the contract plan. At the reporting meeting, the erroneous thinking of "letting out a sigh of relief" of some cadres was strictly criticized, and it was further pointed out that the current task is very arduous. For example, of the 550,000 mu of land in the severely affected areas where water has been drained and ice has been suppressed, the vast majority has continued to be drained, and it is estimated that only 50,000 to 60,000 mu cannot be sown in the end. How to organize the masses to rush planting is an urgent task at present. At the same time, the fishing area has been reduced, and there is a lack of reed raw materials, which urgently needs leadership to transition. Recently, due to the development of agricultural production, the textile sideline industry has been affected by seasonal limitations. For example, in the ninth district, women have participated in agricultural labor, and more than one-third of the spinning wheels have stopped.
    The meeting decided: In order to successfully overcome this difficult period between spring and summer, and the urgent period of spring plowing, sowing, sideline production, and river work, it is necessary to focus on spring planting and closely combine the three according to seasonal changes and the specific situation of the disaster. Quickly issue various kinds of food loans to support agricultural and sideline production and solve living difficulties. Several specific tasks were also stipulated:
    First, ensure timely spring plowing and sowing. Strengthen drainage work in waterlogged areas and expand the planting area. Seeds must be checked, especially cotton seeds and cotton fields, to ensure the completion of the cotton planting plan.
    Second, protect wheat and increase yield. It is necessary to ensure that autumn wheat is hoed at least once before the end of April. Continue to comb spring wheat to ensure that there are no clods of soil on the wheat ridges. And check for diseases and pests at any time, and capture and eliminate them as soon as they are discovered.
    Third, do a good job in sideline production to support agriculture. It is necessary to resolutely develop textile production in lightly affected areas; the spinning wheels that have stopped in severely affected areas should be quickly restored. Disaster-stricken people weaving mats should be transferred to textile production in a planned way. Mobilize women to collect firewood and pick wild vegetables to save food.
    Fourth, complete the spring work of river defense on time. Solve the problem of food difficulties for family members of laborers, organize mutual assistance and exchange of labor to ensure timely spring plowing for laborers. Strengthen ideological education for laborers to ensure that the river is repaired on schedule. After the meeting on the 14th, the cadres went to the districts to arrange and inspect the work.

　　全力进行春耕不放弃副业生产
    玉田灾民渐有余粮
    【本报讯】河北省唐山专区春耕检查团于本月九日到达唐山专区灾区玉田县。当晚听该县汇报。十三日又召开全县主要干部会议，讨论布置今后工作。材料证明：玉田广大灾区，春耕播种、副业生产及春工工作已获得显著成绩。全县十二个区，原计划播种春麦一五九五四三亩，据四月五日统计，已完成二○五五六○亩，超过原计划四六○一七亩。部分退水较晚地区，尚在继续播种。此外，并播种大麦七○○七亩。全县十四万多亩秋麦，绝大部分锄过一至两遍，麦苗出土后，亦大都进行了梳垅，少数的已轧了一遍。全县除新脱水地区尚未进行春垡外，其余全部深耕一遍。早熟作物即将抢种完毕，播种大田已开始。治河民工已组织和准备妥当，第一批约七千人已按期到达河段工作。全县重灾区，纺织、编织、治鱼等副业生产亦获利很大。仅据五个重灾区统计，治鱼的四二五八户，即获利玉米九○一三三一斤。两个月以来，七个重灾区织布、纺线得到利润玉米七四四五二○斤，编席得到利润玉米二一四○○二·五斤。在生产渡荒方针下，广大灾民的生活，得到极大转变。七个重灾区原有要饭的一千五百多户，现在已减到不到一百户。四、十一两区，要饭的已经绝迹，原有逃荒的八百六十户，已回来五百多户。十区并增加牲口二十三头。绝大多数灾民，每户都积存了三、四斗粮。
  积水区大部土地脱出
  应组织群众抢耕抢种
    但两个多月以来，由于县级领导上，着重了重灾区或轻灾区的重灾村领导，忽视了轻灾区轻灾村的重灾户；着重了轻灾区的农业，忽视了副业，而使轻灾区的灾情有的有些发展。据本月五日统计，五个轻灾区要饭的发展到五一二户；吃半粮半糠的发展到三三三八户。其次各级干部还缺乏认真的遵守合同的观念，县供销社和专区订立十万匹土布合同，虽已逐级的订立到区，有的到村；但缺乏具体检查督促，有些区陷于自流。两个半月仅完成六万三千余匹，对保证合同失掉了把握。经过检查，重新调整任务，力争实现合同计划。在汇报会议上，严格批判了某些干部“松一口气”的错误思想，进一步指出当前任务十分重大。如排水脱地后重灾区积水押冰的五十五万亩土地，已有绝大部分继续脱出，估计最后仅有五、六万亩不能播种，如何组织群众抢耕抢种实为当前紧急任务。同时目前，渔利面积已经缩小，苇子原料缺乏，急需领导转业。最近由于农业生产的发展，纺织副业为季节所限已受到影响，如九区妇女参加了农业劳动，纺线的停止了三分之一以上。
    会议决定：为胜利渡过这青黄不接，而春耕播种、副业生产、河工交加的紧迫时期，必须以春种为主，根据季节变化和灾情的具体情况，三者密切结合。迅速发放各种贷粮，以支持农副业生产，解决生活困难。并规定了几项具体工作：
    第一，保证春耕播种及时。积水区加强排水工作，扩大种地面积。要检查种籽，特别切实检查棉籽、棉地，保证完成种棉计划。
    第二，保护小麦增加产量。要保证在四月底以前，将来锄秋麦至少锄过一遍。晚春麦继续进行梳麦工作，保证麦垅不存土块。并随时检查病、虫害，随时发现即捕灭。
    第三，搞好副业支持农业。必须坚决开展轻灾区纺织；重灾区已停止的纺车，迅速的恢复起来。织席灾民有计划的转入纺织。发动妇女拾烧柴，采野菜，节约粮食。
    第四，按时完成河防春工。解决民工家属吃食困难，组织互助变工，做到民工春耕及时。加强民工思想教育，保证把河如期修好。十四日，会议结束后，干部即分别下区布置检查。
