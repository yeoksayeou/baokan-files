　　Bank of China Holds Board Meeting
    Elects Standing Director Nan Hanchen as Chairman
    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th—The Board of Directors of the Bank of China held a meeting in Beijing on the 9th. Twenty directors attended, including Nan Hanchen, Sha Qianli, Zhang Hanfu, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Shao'ao, Gong Yinbing, Ji Chaoding, Zhan Wu, Song Hanzhang, Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Guangfu, Li Ming, Xu Jiliang, Du Yong, Ma Yinchu, Cao Juru, Hu Jingyun, Sun Xiaocun, Jin Runquan, and Zheng Tieru. A few directors in Hong Kong were unable to attend due to business or illness, and all provided written authorization for other directors to represent them. The Board of Directors immediately re-elected the Standing Directors. As a result, Nan Hanchen, Song Hanzhang, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Naiqi, Hu Jingyun, and Chen Guangfu were elected with the most votes, and the Government Administration Council designated Nan Hanchen as Chairman. The Board of Directors also passed many important resolutions, including: (1) Recommending that the government revise and promulgate the bank's original regulations. (2) Ratifying the temporary appointment by the government of Gong Yinbing as General Manager, and Ji Chaoding and Zhan Wu as Deputy General Managers after the Shanghai liberation, due to the dispersal of responsible personnel at the head office; and ratifying all administrative measures taken by them since June 6, 1949, before this Board meeting, including changes in staffing, appointments and removals, business accounting affairs, and instructions issued to domestic and foreign branches. (3) Ratifying the relocation of the bank's head office management division to Beijing for office work. (4) The authorization letters issued by the bank to heads of overseas branches and personnel sent abroad will continue to be issued by the Chairman or General Manager as before. (5) Approved the General Manager Gong Yinbing's report on business, organization, and personnel changes after the resumption of operations.
    In his business report, General Manager Gong Yinbing pointed out that after liberation, the bank's domestic branches, under the leadership of the People's Bank of China and in accordance with the government's instructions, have transformed the Bank of China into a truly specialized foreign exchange bank. In the past year, the bank has done a lot of work in supporting exports, absorbing overseas remittances, and handling specific foreign exchange management matters entrusted by the People's Bank, as well as various related foreign exchange businesses. Regarding the work of overseas branches, he pointed out that as of now, among the nineteen branches, eleven branches, including Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Calcutta, Bombay, Karachi, Chittagong, Rangoon, and Jakarta (formerly Batavia), have restored normal relations with the head office after overcoming various conspiracies and sabotage by the Kuomintang reactionaries. He especially mentioned that the assets of the Hong Kong branch, under the leadership of Manager Zheng Tieru, did not suffer any losses. Singapore has made new creations in the overseas remittance business, such as the "fixed amount remittance method for term," and Zhang Jinghui, the manager of the Bangkok branch, disregarded the threats of the Kuomintang reactionaries and resolutely and publicly expressed his support for the People's Government. The British colleagues (including some British staff) of the Bank of England jointly sent a telegram resolutely accepting the leadership of the head office, and so on.
    It is noted that the Bank of China is a joint public-private specialized bank. The Government Administration Council issued an order on March 22, recognizing the original commercial shareholders, directors, and supervisors, except for war criminals, and appointed Nan Hanchen, Cao Juru, Ma Yinchu, Hu Jingyun, Sha Qianli, Zhang Hanfu, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Shao'ao, Gong Yinbing, Ji Chaoding, Zhan Wu, Sun Xiaocun, and Zheng Tieru as 13 government-appointed directors, and He Xiangning, Chen Jiageng, Situ Meitang, Xu Dixing, and Li Shizhang as five government-appointed supervisors. This Board meeting was the first after the bank's reorganization.

    该行总经理龚饮冰在业务报告中指出，解放后该行国内行处依据政府的指示，在人民银行领导下，已把中国银行改造成一个名符其实的外汇专业银行。一年来该行在扶助出口、吸收侨汇和受人民银行委托经办管理外汇的具体事务及有关各种外汇业务上，都作了很多工作。关于海外行处工作，他指出：截至目前止，在十九个行处中，已有香港、新加坡、伦敦、槟榔屿、吉隆坡、加尔各答、孟买、喀拉蚩、吉大港、仰光及雅加达（即前巴大维亚）等十一处，在战胜国民党反动派各种阴谋破坏后，与总处恢复正常关系。他特别提到香港行的财产在郑铁如经理领导下未受丝毫损失，新加坡在侨汇业务上有“约期定额汇款办法”等新的创造，曼谷行的经理张镜辉不顾国民党反动派的威胁，而毅然公开表示拥护人民政府。英行同仁（包括一部分英籍职员）联名来电坚决接受总处领导等等。
