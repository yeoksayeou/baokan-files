Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 9th: Tianjin is seeing competition among various industries in paying industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of last year. Some industrialists and businessmen are even voluntarily increasing their tax amounts, adding "fen" (a unit of tax assessment) and "jin" (weight), and guaranteeing fair assessment and timely payments. This surge in enthusiasm is primarily due to a series of efforts by the Tianjin Tax Promotion Committee. During the tax collection process, a large number of activists and model businesses have emerged. The committee successively convened mobilization meetings for industry representatives and group leaders citywide, announcing the total burden for this period as 67.5 million "jin" of millet, with an assessed value of 2 million "fen," each "fen" being equivalent to 35 "jin" of millet. Following the meetings, various industries began small-scale deliberations.

At this time, tax officials, industry representatives, and group leaders also went deep into the businesses to work. Through various formats such as large meetings, small meetings, and individual talks, the business owners gained a deeper understanding of the People's Government's tax policies from the explanations of tax officials, industry representatives, and group leaders. They also heard specific comparisons of the business situations and tax figures of private versus public enterprises and the second half versus the first half of the year. They all realized that this tax was not heavy. Many industrial and commercial households also learned from these individuals about Tianjin's achievements in using tax revenue to support the front lines and construct the city last year, greatly enhancing their patriotic fervor.

As a result, a large number of tax payment activists and model businesses emerged. They expressed their determination to consciously pay taxes, and many businesses even voluntarily requested to increase their tax "fen." In addition, many factories actively assisted in the tax collection work, and more than 400 people have already been commended by the Promotion Committee for this. Among the industries, the bean and dried fruit industries first challenged the entire city, not only increasing the number of "jin" of millet per "fen" but also guaranteeing fair assessment. Other industries quickly followed suit with challenges and responses.

As of the 4th, more than 90% of the city's industries had voluntarily raised the number of "jin" per "fen" to between 40 and 60 "jin." However, in order to consider the development of industry and commerce, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government decided to continue collecting taxes at 35 "jin" per "fen." The city's tax work began to transition to the democratic assessment phase on the 5th. As of the 8th, the tax "fen" for each industry had been basically adjusted, and group assessment work within each industry was about to begin. Li Zhouxing, Director of the Tianjin Tax Bureau, emphasized at a meeting of all tax cadres held on the 8th that industry group meetings are a crucial key to achieving a fair and reasonable burden within the industry.

　　津市工商户竞赛纳税
    保证评议公平按期缴纳税款
    【新华社天津九日电】天津市在征收去年下半年度工商税中，各行业间展开挑战竞赛，有的工商业者并自动提高税额，增分、增斤，并保证评议公平，按期缴款。形成这一热潮的原因，主要是津市税收推动委员会进行了一系列的工作，在征税过程中涌现了大批积极分子和模范行户。该委员会曾先后召开全市各行业委员及小组长的动员大会，公布此次负担总额为六千七百五十万斤小米，评议假定分数为二百万分，每分小米三十五斤。会后各行户即进行小型的酝酿。
    这时，税务工作人员及行业委员和小组长也深入到行户工作。各行户经过了大会、小会及个别谈话等各种形式，从税务工作人员和行业委员、小组长的解释中，更进一步地了解人民政府的税收政策，同时也听到了他们关于私营与公营、下半年度与上半年度的营业情形及纳税数字的具体比较，都认识到这次税收并不重，许多工商户还从这些人员口中知道去年津市以税收支援前线和建设城市的成绩，大大地提高了爱国热情。
    这样，大批纳税积极分子及模范行户就涌现了，他们表示一定自觉的纳税，很多行户并且自动要求增加税分。另有不少厂户积极协助税收工作，因此而受到推动委员会表扬的已有四百余人。在行业间，首先是豆食、果子两业向全市挑战，除提高分米斤数外，并保证评议公平。各行业随即纷纷挑战、应战。
    截至四日止，全市已有百分之九十以上的行业自愿将每分斤数提到四十斤到六十斤。但天津市人民政府为了照顾工商业的发展起见，决定仍按每分三十五斤征收。该市税收工作五日起已开始转入民主评议阶段。至八日止，各行业税分已经基本上调整完毕，即将进行各行业内部的小组评议工作。天津市税务局局长李周行在八日召开的全体税务工作干部会议上强调指出：行业小组会议是达到行业内部负担公平合理的重要关键。
