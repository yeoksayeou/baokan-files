　　Malayan National Liberation Army Victorious in Counterattacks:
    British Imperialist "Anti-Bandit Month" Utterly Fails
    Guerrilla Activities Extend to Vicinity of Federal Capital
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 7th] The Malayan National Liberation Army continues to launch victorious counterattacks throughout Malaya. According to Reuter's reports: From March 29th to April 4th, the Liberation Army widely attacked British troops, police, police stations, and colonial planters in areas such as Segamat in Johor, Bahau and Gemas in Negeri Sembilan, Parit Buntar in Kedah, and the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. Battles took place every day. The Liberation Army not only attacked small police forces, but also used new weapons to intercept a British armored vehicle patrol on a highway near Brau, destroying two armored vehicles. The Liberation Army also derailed British colonial armored trains twice in central Malaya. The guerrilla activities of the Malayan National Liberation Army have extended to the vicinity of the federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. On the 2nd, the Liberation Army attacked the village of Taman Selera, seven miles from Kuala Lumpur, and on the same day, threw grenades at "volunteers" in the city. Reuters believes that "this is the first incident to occur in the federal capital."
    Under the forceful counterattacks of the Malayan National Liberation Army, the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" implemented by the British colonial authorities in Malaya since February 26th ended on April 2nd after suffering a disastrous defeat. United Press International Singapore, April 3rd dispatch stated: "At the end of the 'Anti-Bandit Month,' the government was subjected to fierce attacks from newspapers and the public. The five weeks of 'Anti-Bandit Month' seem to have become a victory for the 'bandits.' Critics say: Look, it's more like a 'Bandit Month'." The dispatch continued: "The number of 'bandit' victories shows that the number of casualties on the government side is likely to be very high."

　　马来亚解放军胜利反击
    英帝“反匪月”彻底失败   
    游击活动发展至联邦首府附近
    【新华社七日讯】马来亚民族解放军继续在马来亚各地展开胜利反击。综合路透社消息：自上月二十九日至本月四日，解放军在柔佛州的雪加马、森美兰州的巴哈、占马士，吉打州的巴林及吉隆坡的外围等地区，广泛地袭击英国军警、警察派出所及殖民者的种植园。战斗每天都在进行。解放军不仅袭击小规模的警察部队，而且以新式武器，在布劳附近公路上截击了英军装甲车巡逻队，焚毁装甲车两辆。解放军并在马来亚中部使英国殖民者的装甲火车两度出轨。马来亚民族解放军的游击活动已发展至联邦首府吉隆坡附近。二日，解放军袭击了离吉隆坡七英里的德曼塞拉村，同日，更在市区内以手榴弹投掷“志愿军”。路透社认为“这是首次发生在联邦首府的事件”。
    在马来亚民族解放军有力的反击下，马来亚英国殖民当局自二月二十六日开始实行的所谓“反匪月”，已在遭到惨败后于本月二日宣告结束。合众社新加坡三日电称：“在‘反匪月’结束之时，政府受到报纸和公众的猛烈攻击。五周来的‘反匪月’，似乎已成为‘匪徒’的胜利。批评的人们说：你看，这倒是更像‘匪月’一些哩。”该电继称：“‘匪徒’胜利的次数显示：政府方面的死伤人数，可能是很高的。”
