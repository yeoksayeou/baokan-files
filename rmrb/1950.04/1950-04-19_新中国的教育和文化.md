　　New China's Education and Culture
    Lu Dingyi, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    We must not only transform a politically oppressed and economically exploited China into a politically free and economically prosperous China, but also transform a China ruled by old culture, and therefore ignorant and backward, into a China ruled by new culture, and therefore civilized and advanced.
                                    —Mao Zedong: On New Democracy

    I
    The great victory of the Chinese revolution is not only of paramount importance to the struggle to defend world peace, but also a matter of extreme significance for the development of human culture. Just imagine, a quarter of the world's population will be liberated from ignorance and backwardness, their wisdom and creative power will have the opportunity for high development, and they will be invested in the construction of a new world of peace and democracy. Isn't this something most worthy of attention for the creation of world civilization and the progress of culture?
    More than two thousand years of feudal rule and nearly a hundred years of imperialist enslavement of China have turned this country with the longest cultural history into a culturally ignorant and backward country. The wisdom and creative talents of the people have been tragically stifled, and the excellent cultural traditions cannot be developed. Now, the Chinese people have stood up, and under the leadership of the working-class party—the Communist Party of China—have overthrown the long rule of imperialism and feudalism, and ended more than two thousand years of dark history. This is an earth-shattering event! The Chinese people have built their own country and will build their own culture in the same way. This is entirely possible, because once cultural and educational undertakings are in the hands of the broad masses of working people, its creative power is limitless. This new people's culture and education is not only the cause of the Chinese working people themselves, but also an important part of the cultural cause of advanced humanity in the world.
    In 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong published the famous "On New Democracy." This is the most outstanding work that uses Marxist-Leninist ideology to analyze the modern Chinese cultural history. In this book, Comrade Mao Zedong predicted the future of Chinese culture, which are the two sentences quoted at the beginning of this article. He also said: "In the entire history of China, the progress of the twenty years after the May Fourth Movement not only surpassed the previous eighty years, but even surpassed the previous thousands of years. If there are another twenty years, where will China's progress go? Can't we imagine it?" Now, in just ten years, the New China predicted by Comrade Mao Zedong has been realized. In the next fifteen to twenty years, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese people and the assistance of advanced humanity in the world, especially socialist Soviet Union, our country will be built into one of the most civilized and advanced countries in the world. Isn't this prospect even more conceivable?
    In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong elaborated on the nature, content, and future of the Chinese New Culture Movement from the class viewpoint and the dialectical relationship between international culture and national culture, refuting the nonsense of bourgeois idealists and the Trotskyite bandits regarding Chinese culture. He pointed out that since the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, the Chinese New Culture Movement has been of a New Democratic nature, that is, it is a culture led by the proletariat, of the masses, and anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, and therefore also a part of the international proletariat's socialist culture. He pointed out that the content of Chinese New Democratic culture is national, scientific, and popular culture, that is: "It opposes the oppression of imperialism, advocates the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation, and is national to us, with the characteristics of our nation. It is connected with the socialist culture and new democratic culture of all other nations, establishing a relationship of mutual absorption and mutual development, and mutually serving as a part of the world's new culture." "It opposes all feudal ideas and superstitious ideas, advocates seeking truth from facts, advocates objective truth, and advocates the unity of theory and practice." "It should serve more than 90% of the workers, peasants, and toiling masses of the entire nation, and gradually become their culture." These principles put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong are clearly stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, and are embodied in various policies for building the cultural and educational undertakings of New China (Articles 41 to 49 of the Common Program). These principles and policies are the general line and general policy for the current Chinese cultural and educational construction.

    II
    After the establishment of the Central People's Government, in addition to the military task of eliminating the remaining enemies and liberating Taiwan and Tibet, which still requires arduous tasks to be completed, the other two main tasks facing the Chinese people are economic construction and cultural construction. Comrade Mao Zedong once predicted at last year's CPPCC meeting that with the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction would inevitably appear. This prediction will definitely be realized. However, in order to make our work go well, we must make great efforts to prepare to meet this high tide of cultural construction. Due to the long-term feudal rule, especially the fascist rule of the Kuomintang for more than 20 years, the working people have no access to education, and illiteracy accounts for the vast majority of the national population. Various cultural and artistic activities are out of reach of the broad masses of working people. The research career of natural science was even more devastated. Even the few original scientific equipment was destroyed or moved away by the Kuomintang bandits. Now, we must re-establish the foundation of new democratic culture and education under this broken situation and under extremely difficult material conditions, relying on the strength of the people.
    Faced with this complex and arduous project, our work is proceeding towards two main goals: The first is to transfer the cultural and educational undertakings from the hands of a few people in the past to the foundation of the broad masses of working people; The second is to make our cultural and educational undertakings effectively serve the restoration and development of national production and construction. That is to say, to make the popularization and improvement of culture and education well combined, and to make theory and practice well combined. In order to enable us to successfully complete our tasks, we must rely on several important conditions, namely: the correct ideological leadership of the working class and its party; the support of the broad masses of working people; the consolidation and expansion of the united front of cultural workers from all revolutionary classes; and the help and cooperation of international socialist culture. It should be said that we have already obtained such conditions, so we believe that even under difficult objective circumstances, we can satisfactorily carry out our work.
    Below, I would like to briefly describe the current situation of culture and education in our country and the work we are doing.
    According to existing materials, there are currently about 300,000 primary schools nationwide, with more than 20 million students; about 5,000 secondary schools, with more than 1.5 million students; and about 200 colleges and universities, with more than 140,000 students. This is far from enough in proportion to the population of 475 million in China. However, the facts of the past year prove that in the liberated areas, wherever the land reform has been completed and the industry has been significantly restored, the development of education is quite rapid. For example, the current Northeast Administrative Region has 3,777,151 primary school students, an increase of 48.2% compared with the 2,541,322 during the Japanese occupation. There are 143,986 middle school students, an increase of 108.6% compared with the 68,940 during the Japanese occupation in 1941. Hebei Province currently has 2,337,401 primary school students, an increase of 89% compared with 1,233,786 in 1936, before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The current number of middle school students in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Chahar has increased by 31.8% compared with 1936. In terms of the number of schools, the Northeast Administrative Region has currently exceeded 60% before liberation, and the five provinces of North China have increased by about 50% compared with the Kuomintang rule. Looking at the class composition of students, we can also see huge changes. Taking the Northeast as an example, the children of workers, farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and urban poor accounted for 81.3% of all enrolled children last year. For example, according to statistics from Lin County, a province in the North China Plain, children from poor peasants, farm laborers and middle peasants accounted for 94% of all enrolled children. This situation has never happened in Chinese history.
    In terms of adult education, eliminating illiteracy is an extremely important task. As mentioned earlier, the number of illiterate people accounts for the vast majority of the national population, so it will be a long-term task to universally complete the task of eliminating illiteracy. But in any case, in individual areas, this work has had amazing results. For example, in the Lushun-Dalian area of Northeast China, within one year last year, the area systematically reduced the illiteracy rate from 30% of the total population to just over 4%. Of course, this is the most prominent example. It is particularly worth pointing out that the literacy work in the Lushun-Dalian area can achieve such great results due to the active guidance and assistance of Soviet education experts. Now, the literacy movement is being carried out all over the country. The main methods are running literacy classes and winter schools. The latter is to widely promote literacy education among farmers during the slack winter season. Last year, about one million farmers participated in this winter school. This year, we plan to greatly increase the number of cultural schools and literacy classes in rural areas, and prepare to launch a universal illiteracy eradication movement across the country in 1951. This movement will first be carried out in areas where land reform has been completed.
    Another important task in adult education is spare-time education. After liberation, due to the development of economic recovery work, many cadres who were originally from peasant backgrounds deeply felt the need to learn culture. Chinese workers have shown an inspiringly high degree of enthusiasm in the restoration and development of production. They are enthusiastically engaged in production competitions, labor model movements, and new record creation movements, and they automatically invent new technologies and improve production efficiency. Because of this situation, they are also eagerly demanding to learn culture and scientific knowledge.
    In the past year, this kind of spare-time school has been established one after another in various places. In the five provinces of North China, 340 spare-time cultural schools have been established for workers and peasant cadres. A total of 2,110 workers' spare-time schools have been established nationwide (remedial classes are not included), with 751,109 workers participating in the study. But these numbers are still far from the actual needs, so these schools need to be added.
    It is not enough to only have these types of spare-time schools. China needs many highly skilled industrial workers, technicians, engineers, management personnel, and various types of senior specialists needed by the country. Therefore, establishing regular schools, cultivating talents with advanced scientific knowledge from the peasant and intellectual cadres who have been tested by long-term wars and land reforms, from the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and from the workers is an urgent task.
    Based on the above situation, the Central People's Government is prepared to make the development of worker-peasant education and the training of new intellectuals from worker-peasant backgrounds the primary task of cultural and educational work. The significance of this work is not only to solve the cultural requirements of workers and peasants today, but also to make the necessary preparations for China's socialist construction in the future. We hope that in seven or ten years, China will be able to start producing tens of thousands of highly educated intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds, who can work with those intellectuals from other classes who are determined to serve the motherland, the people, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become the backbone of economic construction, cultural construction, and national defense construction. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government also plans to establish Renmin University of China in 1950, which will enroll students from worker and peasant backgrounds. The curriculum and academic system of this university are completely new and are formulated based on the experience of the Soviet Union and the needs of China's economic construction. We should especially thank our Soviet friends for giving us great help in this work. Secondly, the government is planning to start a three-year worker-peasant fast-track middle school across the country in 1950 by educational institutions, factories, and troops. Workers, peasant cadres, and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army will be transferred to complete the basic curriculum of secondary schools in three years so that they can directly enter universities or higher vocational schools after graduation.
    In addition to taking the above-mentioned measures to open education to workers, peasants and soldiers, it is necessary to completely change the bad situation in the past where education was completely divorced from national construction. The education department must have close ties with various industrial, agricultural, transportation, financial and financial management departments, etc., and train talents in a planned manner to meet the needs of various construction, eliminate the phenomenon of "graduation is unemployment," and help and guide various departments to run advanced and intermediate technical schools to supplement the cadres they need.
    Another task in education is political education for the transformation of old intellectuals. The construction of the people's cultural and educational undertakings in China must be carried out jointly by intellectuals from all revolutionary classes; old intellectuals and technical personnel should also be given appropriate education so that they can serve the revolution. The CPC Central Committee has clearly stipulated that the policy towards intellectuals is: win over, unite, educate and transform. To this end, it has instructed to establish various short-term political universities or training courses in various places, mainly to help intellectuals establish a revolutionary outlook on life and the ideas of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. In 1949, more than 200,000 people participated in this type of school, and after completing their studies, they were assigned to various practical jobs. Now political study has become an extremely widespread upsurge among the people. Various working cadres, professors and teachers, artists and scientists, especially educated youths, all regard political study as an indispensable part of their daily lives. The general items they study are the history of social development, political economy, and the main works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as well as the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. At the same time, they also enthusiastically discuss some current affairs issues. This study has achieved remarkable results. It is manifested in the fact that the illusions of the intellectuals about American imperialism in the past and the lack of understanding of the socialist Soviet Union have been broken. The largest part of the intellectuals realizes the value of labor and recognizes that they are mental workers and should stand with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The longing for the highly developed science and culture of the socialist Soviet Union has aroused the enthusiasm of Chinese youth and intellectuals to learn Russian. In major cities, there are many Russian training classes. Beijing and Shenyang teach Russian through radio, and in Beijing alone, there are as many as 7,000 listeners.

    III
    The creation and activities of literature and art have always occupied a very important position in the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. The Chinese people regard literature and art as a major weapon of ideological education and ideological struggle. In July 1949, a national representative conference of literary and artistic workers was held in Beijing, attended by 660 writers, playwrights, film workers, artists, musicians, and dancers, who discussed the direction of new Chinese people's literature and art and established a unified organization of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, in order to strengthen the government's leadership over literature and art, a Ministry of Culture was established, and the leader of this ministry is Mr. Mao Dun, China's most famous novelist.
    Chinese literary and art workers take Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942 as the basic guiding principle for literary and artistic policies, that is: Literature and art must serve politics and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Literature and art must be combined with the masses, and popularizing it to the workers, peasants, and soldiers should be its primary task. The popularization and improvement of literature and art should be well combined—literature and art should be popularized under the guidance of improvement and improved on the basis of popularization. Under the guidance of this correct policy, the Chinese literary and art movement has been universally deepened into the masses of workers and peasants in the liberated areas since 1942. This has not only enriched literature and art with rich, fleshy life content and lively forms, making it a powerful weapon for reflecting the thoughts and feelings of the working people and educating them, but also discovered and cultivated many artists of worker and peasant origin with wisdom and creative talents in such work. They have worked hard to reform and create various national art forms, among which the most popular and popular among the masses are "Yangko Dance" and "Waist Drum". In the army, the soldiers wrote their own poems on the handles of their guns, organized their own troupes to perform their own lives. In factories, workers generally establish their own troupes, singing teams, and clubs, and launched a workers' literary creation movement. Their works are often published in major newspapers. On May Day last year, 48 plays created by the workers themselves were performed simultaneously in various factories in Beijing, and more than 3,000 workers directly participated in this performance and street dance. In Tianjin and the Northeast, the scale is even larger. The literary and artistic movement has shown a significant role in inspiring the workers' enthusiasm for production. As a common organizational form of literary and artistic activities, the literary and artistic work troupe is a comprehensive work group including drama, dance, music, fine arts, and literary activities. In various major cities and troops, there are such groups working. Other literary and artistic work troupes perform touring performances in rural areas.
    The creative activities of writers are closely combined with the lives and struggles of the masses, which is one of the main conditions for the brilliant development of realism in Chinese literature and art. Many famous writers have lived with farmers and soldiers for a long time and directly participated in land reform work and military work. Therefore, the content of most of their works reflects land reform and the liberation war. A new task in the future is that literary and artistic creation should serve the restoration and development of industrial production. In 1950, we plan to send another group of writers to factories, rural areas, and troops. A part of China's outstanding works have been introduced to various revolutionary countries. At the same time, international revolutionary literary and artistic works, especially Soviet works, are warmly welcomed among Chinese readers. It is particularly worth mentioning that Simonov's "Days and Nights", Korneichuk's "The Front", and Beck's "Fear and Courage" have become the most popular reading materials in the army during the Liberation War. Many troops stipulated these works as compulsory documents for cadres and compiled popular editions as the most practical teaching materials for military education. Therefore, among the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, these writers, and even the heroes in their works, have become very familiar and beloved names.
    When the Central People's Government was established last year, a delegation of Soviet cultural workers headed by A. Fadeyev came to China. The delegation was warmly welcomed by thousands of people in Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Jinan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. They gave valuable help and enlightenment to the Chinese culture, art and scientific work with brotherly friendship and love. Soon after, a literary and art troupe from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea came to China. In 1949, China also sent groups of cultural workers to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to attend the World Peace Conference and the Soviet October Revolution anniversary celebrations. This mutual visit of cultural groups proves to be a very meaningful work for international cultural exchanges. In 1950, the Central People's Government plans to send more scientists, artists, and journalists to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to study and investigate, and plans to exchange students with each other.
    In the people's art cause, developing the film industry is a major task. As early as 1946, we had already established our own people's film industry in the Northeast. Now the state-owned film factory has an advantage in the national film production. During the Kuomintang rule, American films accounted for three-quarters of the films shown across the country. Most of these films promoted yellow culture and fascist ideas. After the national liberation, this situation is gradually but resolutely being changed. In 1950, the state-owned film industry plans to produce 44 films, 48 newsreels, and translate 40 Soviet films.
    In order to popularize movies among workers, peasants and soldiers, another major task is to organize a large number of film projection teams to go deep into factories, rural areas and troops. In 1950, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government plans to organize 700 such projection teams so that workers, peasants and soldiers can enjoy the appreciation of movies at the lowest cost or free of charge. In the construction of the film, Soviet friends have given us great material and technical assistance, which deserves special thanks.
    The weakest link is the research work of natural science. The reason for this is obvious: imperialists and their lackeys not only did not want, but also tried their best to hinder the development of Chinese technology and science. China has many outstanding scientists who are internationally renowned. Under the Kuomintang rule, they did not get the appropriate opportunity and equipment to carry out research work. Now the People's Government is making its best efforts to carry out this work. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has been established last year, and its below includes various scientific research institutes. Mr. Guo Moruo, a famous Chinese scholar and Vice Premier of the State Council, personally leads the work of the Academy of Sciences.
    The basic policy of new China's scientific construction is to closely link the research of natural science with the industrial, agricultural, and national defense construction. The new China's science will work for the cause of peace and for the prosperity of our country. We must reform some outdated theories and research methods, help scientific workers accept the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism and apply them to the research work of natural science, and establish a true science that has close links with the people's lives. Therefore, we must establish good cooperation between the Academy of Sciences and the economic construction departments, between scientists and workers and peasants, and must carry out a popularization movement of scientific knowledge among workers and peasants. For this purpose, a Science Popularization Bureau has been established under the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. In the work of introducing new natural scientific knowledge, special mention should be made of the establishment of the "Michurin Society", which studies and disseminates Michurin's theory and applies it to Chinese agriculture.
    China is a country with infinite resources. To develop these resources, we need a high level of science and technology and a large number of scientific talents. This is an extremely arduous task. In this work, we urgently need the scientific friendship and assistance from the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries.

　　新中国的教育和文化
    中国共产党中央宣传部部长  陆定一
    我们不但要把一个政治上受压迫经济上受剥削的中国，变为一个政治上自由经济上繁荣的中国，而且要把一个被旧文化统治因而愚昧与落后的中国，变成一个被新文化统治因而文明先进的中国。
                                    ——毛泽东：新民主主义论                            
    一
    中国革命的伟大胜利，不仅对于保卫世界和平的斗争具有头等重要意义，并且对于人类文化的发展也是一件极其重大的事情。试想一下，全世界四分之一的人口，将从愚昧与落后中解放出来，他们的智慧与创作力量将得到高度的发展的机会，并且投入于新世界和平民主的建设事业中间，这对于世界文明的创造与文化的进步，不是一件最堪重视的事情么？
    二千多年的封建统治和近百年来帝国主义对华的奴役，使这个具有最悠久文化历史的国家，变成了文化上愚昧与落后的国家，人民的智慧与创造才能遭受悲惨的窒杀，优秀的文化传统不能发展。现在，中国人民是站立起来了，在工人阶级政党——中国共产党领导之下，推翻了帝国主义与封建主义的长期统治，结束了两千多年的黑暗历史，这是惊天动地的大事件！中国人民建设了自己的国家，并且要同样来建设起自己的文化。这是完全可能的，因为当文化教育事业一旦掌握在广大劳动人民手里的时候，它的创造力量是无限的。这新的人民的文化教育事业，不仅是属于中国劳动人民自己的事业，同时也是世界先进人类的文化事业的一个重要部分了。
    一九四○年，毛泽东同志发表了著名的“新民主主义论”。这是以马克思列宁主义的思想方法来分析近代中国文化史的一本最杰出的著作。在这本书中，毛泽东同志预言中国文化的前途，这即是摘引在本文前面的两句话。他又说：“全部中国史中，‘五四’以后二十年的进步，不但赛过了以前八十年，简直赛过了以前几千年，假如再有二十年功夫，中国的进步将到何地，不是可以想到的么？”现在仅仅十年功夫，毛泽东同志所预言的新中国已经实现了，而在今后十五年至二十年中间，由于中国人民的努力与世界先进人类首先是社会主义苏联的援助，把我们国家建设成为世界最文明最先进的国家之一，这个前途，不是更具体地可以想到的么？
    毛泽东同志在这本著作中，从阶级观点上和国际文化与民族文化的辩证关系的观点上，阐明了中国新文化运动的性质，内容与前途，驳斥了资产阶级唯心论者与托洛斯基匪帮关于中国文化的胡说。他指出自从一九一九年“五四”以后，中国的新文化运动，即是属于新民主主义的性质，即是说，它是为无产阶级所领导的、人民大众的、反帝反封建的文化，因而也是属于国际无产阶级社会主义文化的一部分。他指出中国新民主主义文化的内容是民族的，科学的，大众的文化，即是说：“它是反对帝国主义的压迫，主张中华民族的尊严与独立的，它是我们这个民族的，带有我们这个民族的特性。它同一切别的民族的社会主义文化与新民主主义文化相联系，建立互相吸收与互相发展的关系，互相作为世界新文化的一部分。”“它是反对一切封建思想与迷信思想，主张实事求是，主张客观真理，主张理论与实践的一致的。”“它应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化。”毛泽东同志所提示的这些原则，被明确地规定在一九四九年中国人民政协的共同纲领之中，而且把它具体化为建设新中国文化教育事业的各项政策（共同纲领第四十一条至四十九条），这些原则与政策，即是当前中国文化教育建设的总路线与总方针。
    二
    中央人民政府成立以后，除了军事上还须肃清残余敌人，和须解放台湾、西藏，因而还有艰苦的任务要去完成以外，摆在中国人民面前的其他两项主要任务，即是经济建设与文化建设。毛泽东同志曾经在去年人民政协会议中预言了，随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。这预言也一定会实现的。但是要使我们工作进行得很好，必须付出巨大的努力，来准备迎接这个文化建设的高潮。由于长期的封建统治，特别是国民党二十余年来的法西斯统治，劳动人民得不到教育的机会，文盲占到全国人口的绝大多数，各种文化艺术活动，与广大的劳动人民无缘。自然科学的研究事业更是被摧残得奄奄一息，连原来就极少的科学设备多被国民党匪帮破坏或搬走。现在，我们必须在这个残破的局面下，在物质条件极其困难的条件下，依靠人民的力量，重新奠立新民主主义文化教育的基础。
    在这个复杂和艰巨工程前面，我们的工作是向着两个主要目标去进行：第一是使文化教育事业从过去少数人的手里，转移到广大劳动人民的基础上；第二是使我们的文化教育事业有效地为恢复与发展国家生产建设而服务。这也就是说，要使文化教育的普及与提高很好的结合起来，使理论与实践很好的结合起来。而要使我们能够胜利地完成我们的任务，必须依靠于几个重要的条件，即是：工人阶级及其政党的正确的思想领导；广大劳动人民的支持；各革命阶层文化工作者的统一战线的巩固与扩大；国际社会主义文化的帮助与合作。应该说，我们已经取得了这样的条件，因此我们相信，即使在困难的客观情形下，我们是能够胜任愉快地进行我们的工作的。
    下面，我想约略地叙述一下目前我国文化教育的状况以及我们正在进行的工作。
    根据现有材料，目前全国约有小学三十万所，学生二千余万人；中等学校约五千所，学生一百五十余万人；专科以上学校约二百所，学生十四万余人。这和中国四万万七千五百万人口数字的比例上来看，是非常不够的。但是从去年一年中的事实证明，在解放后的地区，凡是土地改革已经完成，产业已有显著恢复的地方，教育事业的发展是相当迅速的。例如目前东北行政区，小学生人数为三、七七七、一五一人，比日本占领时期的二、五四一、三二二人，增加了百分之四十八·二。中学生为一四三、九八六人，较一九四一年日本占领时期的六八、九四○人增加了百分之一○八·六。河北省现在的小学生人数为二、三三七、四○一人，比一九三六年，即抗日战争以前的一、二三三、七八六人增加了百分之八十九。河北、山东、山西、察哈尔现在的中学生人数，比起一九三六年增加了百分之三一·八。以学校数目来说，东北行政区目前已经超过解放以前百分之六十，华北五省比国民党统治时期增加了约百分之五十。再从学生的阶级成份来看，也可以看出巨大的变化。以东北来说，工人、雇农、贫农、中农以及城市贫民的子女，在去年已占全体入学儿童百分之八一·三。又如华北平原省林县的统计，贫雇农和中农子女入学者已占全体入学儿童百分之九十四。这种情形在中国历史上是从来没有过的。
    在成人教育方面，扫除文盲是件极其重要的工作。文盲的数目，如前所述，占全国人口的绝大多数，因此要普遍完成扫除文盲的任务，是较长时期的工作。但是无论如何，在个别地区，这项工作已经具有惊人的成效。例如东北的旅大区，在去年一年之内，已经有计划地把全区占总人口百分之三十的文盲，减少到仅仅为百分之四强。自然这是最突出的例子。特别值得指出：旅大地区扫除文盲的工作能有如此巨大的成绩，是由于苏联教育工作专家的积极指导与帮助。现在，识字运动是在全国各地普遍地进行着。主要的方法是办识字班和冬学，后者即是利用冬季农闲时节在农民中广泛地推行识字教育，去年参加这种冬学的农民约达一百余万人。今年我们打算大量增加农村中间的文化学校和识字班，并准备在一九五一年开始在全国进行普遍扫除文盲的运动，这种运动将首先在已经完成土地改革的地区进行。
    成人教育中另一项重要的工作，即是业余教育。解放以后，由于经济恢复工作的开展，许多过去由农民出身的干部深切感到学习文化的需要。中国工人在恢复与发展生产中间，表现出令人感动的高度热情。他们狂热地进行着生产竞赛，劳动模范运动和创造新纪录运动，他们自动地发明新的技术和提高生产效能。而由于这种情况，他们也都迫切地要求学习文化与科学知识。
    去年一年中间，这种业余学校在各地纷纷创办起来。华北五省，为工农干部设立的业余文化学校达三四○所。全国工人业余学校创办了二、一一○所（补习班不包括在内），参加学习的工人为七五一、一○九人。但是这些数目离开实际需要还很远，因之还要增设这种学校。
    仅仅有这类业余学校，还是不够的。中国需要有许多高度技术的产业工人、技师、工程师、管理人员和国家所必需的各种各样的高级专门人才，因此创办正规学校，从经过长期战争和土地改革考验的农民和知识分子干部中，从人民解放军的指挥员战斗员中，和从工人中，培养有高级科学知识的人才，是件迫切的工作。
    根据上述情况，中央人民政府准备把发展工农教育，培养工农出身的新型知识分子，作为文教工作上的首要任务。这个工作的意义，不仅是为了要解决今天工人与农民对文化上的要求，并且要为将来中国进行社会主义的建设作必要的准备。我们企望在七年或十年以后，中国能够开始出现数以万计的由工人农民出身的受过高等教育的知识分子，他们能与那些决心为祖国、为人民、为工农兵服务的由其他阶级出身的知识分子一起工作，成为经济建设、文化建设与国防建设的骨干。中央人民政府教育部并且计划在一九五○年内创办一所中国人民大学，其中要吸收由工农出身的学生，这个大学的课程与学制都完全是新型的，根据于苏联的经验与中国经济建设上的需要而制定。在这件工作上我们应该特别感谢苏联友人给我们以极大的帮助。其次政府正在计划从一九五○年开始由全国各地教育机关、工厂、部队普遍地创办一种三年制的工农速成中学，抽调工农干部及解放军指挥员战斗员，在三年中间学完中等学校的基本课程，以便毕业以后直接升入大学或高等专科学校。
    除了采取上面所说的办法，使教育向工农兵开门以外，必须彻底改变过去教育与国家建设完全脱节的恶劣情况。教育部门必须与各工业部门、农业部门、交通部门、财政金融管理部门等有密切的联系，为各种建设的需要而有计划地训练人才，消灭“毕业就是失业”的现象，并且帮助与指导各部门办理高级的与中级的技术学校，补充所需要的干部。
    教育方面另一件工作，即是为了改造旧知识分子而进行的政治教育。中国的人民文化教育事业的建设必须团结各革命阶层的知识分子来共同进行；对于旧的知识分子和技术人员，亦应该给予他们以适当的教育，使其为革命服务。中共中央曾经明确地规定对知识分子的政策是：争取、团结、教育和改造。为此目的，曾经指示在各地创办各种短期的政治大学或训练班，主要是帮助知识分子建立革命的人生观和辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的思想。一九四九年中，有二十余万人参加了这类学校，学习完毕以后，分配到各种实际工作中去。现在政治学习已经成为人民中间一种极其广泛的热潮。各种工作干部，教授与教师，艺术家与科学家，特别是知识青年，都把政治学习看作是他们日常生活中不可少的一部分。他们一般学习的项目，是社会发展史，政治经济学与马恩列斯的主要著作以及毛泽东同志的著作，同时他们也热烈地讨论着一些时事的问题。这种学习有显著的成绩，表现在知识分子中过去对于美国帝国主义的幻想，和对社会主义苏联的不了解，是被打破了，知识分子中最大的部分，了解到劳动的可贵，认识自己是脑力劳动者，应当与工农兵站在一起。对于社会主义苏联的高度发展的科学与文化的向往，引起中国青年与知识界学习俄文的热心。在各大城市，都有很多俄文训练班。北京和沈阳，经过无线电教授俄文，北京一地的听众就有七千人之多。
    三
    文学与艺术的创造和活动，在中国人民革命事业上一向是占着极重要的地位。中国人民把文艺看作是思想教育与思想斗争一种主要的武器。一九四九年七月，在北京举行了一次全国文学艺术工作者的代表大会，出席有六百六十个作家，戏剧家，电影工作者，美术家，音乐家与舞蹈家，讨论了新中国人民文艺的方向和建立了全国文艺界联合会的统一组织。中央人民政府成立以后，为了加强政府对于文学艺术的领导，设立了一个文化部，这个部的领导者，即是中国最著名的小说家茅盾先生。
    中国文学艺术工作者是以毛泽东同志一九四二年在延安文艺座谈会上的演讲作为文艺政策的基本方针，这即是说：文艺必须服务于政治，服务于工农兵。文艺必须与群众相结合，而以向工农兵的普及作为它第一位任务。文艺的普及与提高工作应该很好的结合——文艺应该在提高的指导下进行普及，在普及的基础上提高。在这个正确的方针指导之下，中国的文艺运动，从一九四二年以后就普遍地深入到解放区的工农群众。这不仅使文学艺术取得了丰富的有血有肉的生活内容和生动活泼的形式，使它成为反映劳动人民的思想感情和教育他们的有力武器，并且在这样的工作中，发现了和培养出许多富于智慧和创造才能的工农出身的艺术家。他们努力地改革和创造出各种民族的艺术形式，其中最被群众欢迎、最流行的，便是“秧歌舞”与“腰鼓”。在部队中间，战士们在枪柄上写下他们自己创作的诗歌，组织自己的剧团演出自己的生活。在工厂中，工人普遍地建立他们自己的剧团，歌咏队和俱乐部，并且展开了工人的文艺创作运动。他们的作品经常刊载在主要的报纸上。在去年五一节，北京市各工厂同时演出了四十八个工人自己创作的剧本，有三千多个工人直接参加了这种演出和街头舞蹈。在天津和东北，其规模还要宏大。文艺运动对于鼓舞工人的生产热情，已经显出有重大的作用。作为文艺活动的一种普遍组织形式，是文艺工作团，这是包括演剧、舞蹈、音乐、美术和文学活动的一种综合性的工作团体，在各个主要城市和部队中间，都有这样团体在工作着，另外的文艺工作团则在农村中作巡回的演出。
    作家的创作活动是和群众的生活斗争密切地结合着，这是使现实主义在中国文艺上得到光辉发展的主要条件之一。许多著名作家长期地和农民与士兵生活在一起，直接参加土地改革工作与部队工作，因此最大部分作品的内容是反映土地改革与解放战争的。今后一个新的任务，即是文艺创作应该为恢复与发展工业生产而服务。一九五○年我们计划再送一批作家到工厂农村与部队中去。中国优秀的作品，已经有一部分被介绍到各个革命国家，同时国际的革命文艺作品，尤其是苏联的作品，在中国读者中间是受到了热烈的欢迎。特别值得一提的，是西蒙诺夫的《日日夜夜》，高涅楚克的《前线》和别克的《恐惧与无畏》诸书，曾经在解放战争中间，成为军队中最流行的读物。许多部队把这些作品规定为干部必读文件，并且编写了通俗本，作为军事教育最实际的教材。因此在解放军的战士中，这些作家，以至他们作品中的英雄，都成为非常熟悉和敬爱的名字。
    去年中央人民政府成立的时候，以Ａ·法捷耶夫为首的苏联文化工作者代表团来到了中国，这个代表团在沈阳、天津、北京、济南、南京、上海各地到处受到千千万万群众热烈的欢迎，他们以兄弟般的友谊与热爱，给了中国文化艺术科学工作以极可珍贵的帮助和启示。不久以后，又有朝鲜人民共和国的文艺工作团来到中国。在一九四九年中，中国也先后派遣文化工作者所组成的团体，到苏联和东欧去参加保卫世界和平大会和苏联的十月革命纪念典礼。这种文化团体的互相访问，证明对于国际文化的交流上是件极有意义的工作。一九五○年中，中央人民政府计划派遣更多的科学家、艺术家和新闻工作者到苏联和东欧去学习考察，并且计划互相交换留学生的工作。
    在人民艺术事业中间，发展电影事业是件重大的任务。远在一九四六年，我们已经在东北建立了人民自己的电影事业。现在国营的电影厂在全国电影生产量上已经占了优势。在国民党统治时期，美国的影片要占到全国上演影片的四分之三，这些影片绝大部分是宣传着黄色的文化和法西斯思想。在全国解放后，这种状态是逐渐地但是坚决地被改变着。一九五○年国营电影事业计划生产电影四十四部，新闻片四十八号，翻译苏联片四十部。
    为了使电影普及到工农兵中间去，另一件主要工作，即是组织大量的放映队，深入工厂、农村和部队。一九五○年中，中央人民政府文化部计划组织七○○个这样的放映队，使工人农民和士兵可以以最低的代价或无代价的享受电影的欣赏。在建设电影的工作上苏联友人给了我们巨大的物质上技术上的帮助，是值得特别感谢的。
    基础最薄弱的一环，是自然科学的研究工作，这理由是显然的：帝国主义者和它的走狗们不仅不愿意并且竭力阻碍着中国技术与科学的发展，中国有许多优秀的、在国际上著名的科学工作者，在国民党统治下，他们得不到适当的机会与设备去进行研究工作。现在人民政府正以最大的努力来进行这项工作。中国科学院已经在去年成立了，它的下面包括各种科学的研究所，中国著名的学者和政务院的副总理郭沫若先生亲自领导科学院的工作。
    新中国科学建设的基本方针，即是自然科学的研究与工业农业及国防建设密切的联结起来，新中国的科学将是为和平事业，为我国的繁荣而工作。我们要改革一些陈旧的学说与研究方法，帮助科学工作者接受辩证唯物主义的观点与方法，应用于自然科学的研究工作，建立与人民生活有密切联系的真正科学。因此我们必须使科学院与经济建设部门，科学家与工人农民之间建立起很好的合作，必须在工人与农民中间进行科学知识的普及运动。为此目的，在中央人民政府的文化部下面，设立了一个科学普及局。在介绍新的自然科学知识的工作方面，要特别提到“米丘林学会”的建立，这个学会研究和传播米丘林的学说，并将它应用于中国的农业中。
    中国是一个拥有无穷富源的国家，要使这些富源开发出来，需有高度的科学与技术和大量的科学人才，这是一个极其艰巨的工作，在这个工作上我们迫切需要苏联和各新民主主义国家的科学的友谊协助。
