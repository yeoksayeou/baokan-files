　　The Sixth Meeting of the Beijing Municipal School Production Committee
    Decides to Strengthen Production Leadership
    Overcome Current Shortcomings in School Production
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Municipal School Production Committee held its sixth meeting on the 18th of this month. Aiming at the shortcomings existing in current school production, the meeting made decisions on strengthening organizational leadership and establishing labor discipline. At the meeting, the achievements of school production were first reported. Currently, 72 middle schools are participating in production. Students are generally enthusiastic, and over 50% of the vegetable plots have been planted, with only a few schools just starting to cultivate the land. Among the 13 university units, most of the land has been cultivated, but not much has been sown yet. The meeting decided that in the future, organizational leadership should be strengthened, and the organization of the production committees of each school should be improved. All resolutions and decisions of the Municipal Production Guidance Committee must be resolutely implemented and executed. The Municipal Production Guidance Committee should continue to organize inspection teams to inspect the fields and convene small meetings in a timely manner to solve problems, and establish a collective office system. The production committees of each school should improve their organization with reference to this spirit. The meeting also decided:
    1. Strictly establish conscious labor discipline and mass discipline. It is strictly forbidden to randomly trample, make noise, damage agricultural tools and waterwheels, steal vegetables, climb trees, play football, or leave production posts without permission in the fields. Implement a work-point system.
    2. Improve management, review production plans, accurately calculate costs, stipulate farming standards, set output targets, and operate like an enterprise. Turn school vegetable gardens into production cooperatives. Resist the perfunctory attitude and promote more manure application and deep plowing and careful cultivation.
    3. All land that can be used to grow vegetables or can be converted into vegetable plots must be used entirely for growing vegetables; it is not allowed to grow large crops such as sweet potatoes, sorghum, corn, and peanuts. If it is absolutely necessary to grow them, it must be approved by the Municipal Production Committee.
    4. Strictly review loans and check whether the loans are used appropriately. Loans should not be used to hire short-term workers. Loans should be mainly used to solve problems related to agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, wells, and waterwheels.
    5. Strengthen the education and management of technicians and exchange laborers, strictly supervise the labor situation of workers, and overcome laziness. Review the qualifications of technicians, replace unqualified ones, and immediately resolve the issue of schools without technicians, without delay. Students must obey the command of technicians and humbly learn from them.
    6. Vegetable seeds and seedlings and fertilizers from the Xijiao Park Farm will be priced by a future evaluation committee and should be 20% lower than the market price.
    The above decisions of the meeting were put forward after in-depth research based on the shortcomings that currently exist in the production of various schools. The current shortcomings in school production are, first of all, very poor labor discipline. For example, some schools have disorganized students who often make noise and play football during labor, and even go to Longevity Hill in the name of production (No. 1 Boys' Middle School), arbitrarily pull up the vegetables of the villagers (such as Shengxin), cut down the branches of farmers' trees (Confucius Church Middle School), randomly trample field seedlings, borrow agricultural tools and return them haphazardly, damage them, ride bicycles in the vegetable beds, sit on waterwheels, and so on. In terms of management, only Huagong School has a production plan. The production plans of other schools are not specific and lack accurate cost calculations. Some schools waste loans. For example, Shengxin hires short-term workers to build ridges, and Huiwen and Xinzhi ignore and hire people to manage, are lazy, and try to save effort and reduce materials. Some schools grow large crops such as sorghum, cotton, peanuts, corn, and sweet potatoes, which violates the government's basic spirit of calling for growing vegetables. They only want to save money and effort, ignoring the economic value and solving the problem of students eating vegetables. Some schools do not pay much attention to production leadership, adopt a laissez-faire attitude, and perfunctorily deal with it. They lack education and inspection of technicians and workers; in addition, the technicians' skills are not high, and the workers are afraid of labor, forming a phenomenon where students work when they come, and if they don't come, they smoke, chat, and sleep in the room. This situation is especially serious at the Academy of Fine Arts. In addition, one root cause of many shortcomings is the failure to convey and earnestly implement the instructions and decisions of the Municipal Production Committee, the failure to assign a dedicated person to attend meetings, and the failure to record attendance.
    In order to correct these phenomena, the School Production Committee requires the production committees of each school to earnestly implement the various resolutions of this meeting.

　　京市学校生产委员会第六次会议
    决定加强生产领导
    克服目前学校生产缺点
    【本报讯】北京市学校生产委员会于本月十八日举行第六次会议，针对目前学校生产中所存在的缺点、作出加强组织领导、树立劳动纪律等决定。会议上首先报告了学校生产的成绩。目前参加生产的有中学七十二校，同学们一般情绪饱满，百分之五十以上的菜地已种下了，仅有少数学校才着手耕地。大学十三个单位，地已大部耕完，但下种的还不多。会议决定今后应加强组织领导，健全各校生产委员会的组织。坚决贯彻与执行市生产指导委员会的一切决议、决定。市生产指导委员会应继续组织检查组到地内检查。和及时召开小型会议解决问题，并建立集体办公制。各校生产委员会均应参照此精神健全组织。会议并决定：
    一、严格建立自觉的劳动纪律和群众纪律。严禁在地内乱踏、打闹、破坏农具、水车，偷菜吃、上树、踢足球、私自离开生产岗位等现象。实行计工制。
    二、改善经营，审定生产计划，精密计算成本，规定耕作标准，定出产量，经营企业化。把学校菜园变为生产合作社。反对应付观点，提倡多上粪与深耕细作。
    三、一切能种菜或可改为菜地的土地必须全部种菜；不许种大庄稼，如白薯、高粱、玉蜀黍、花生等。如一定要种时，需经市生产委员会批准。
    四、严格审核贷款，检查贷款用得是否适当，不得用贷款去雇短工。贷款主要应用于解决农具、肥料、籽种、水井、水车等。
    五、加强对技工与变工工人的教育管理，严格监督工人劳动情形，克服偷懒现象。审核技工，不合格者更换，尚无技工者应立即解决，不得拖延，学生要服从技工的指挥，向技工虚心学习。
    六、用西郊公园农场菜种、菜秧和肥料将来组织评议委员会作价，要比市价低百分之二十。
    会议的以上决定，是根据目前各校在生产中还存在着的缺点，经过深入研究而提出来的。目前学校生产中存在的缺点，首先是劳动纪律很不好，如有些学校同学组织散漫，在劳动时常常打闹、踢足球，甚至借生产之名去逛万寿山（男一中），随意拔老乡的菜（如盛新）、砍农民的树枝（孔教中学）、乱踏田苗、借用农具乱还、破坏、在菜畦内骑自行车、坐在水车上等等现象均曾发生。在经营上，只华工一校有生产计划，其他各校生产计划不具体，缺乏精确的成本计算，有的浪费了贷款。如盛新雇短工打畦，汇文、新知自己不管雇人经营，偷懒，图省工减料。有的种高粱、棉花、花生、玉米、白薯等大庄稼，违背了政府号召种菜的基本精神。只为省钱、省力，忽略经济价值和解决同学的吃菜问题。有些学校对生产领导很不注意，采取放任态度，敷衍应付，对技工和工友缺乏教育与检查；加上技工技术不高，工友怕劳动，形成学生来就动，不来在房中吸烟、谈天、睡大觉的现象，这种情况在美术学院尤其严重。此外有一个造成很多缺点的根源，就是对市生产委员会的指示、决定不传达、不认真执行，开会不固定专人参加、参加会不记录。
    为纠正这些现象，学校生产委员会要求各校生产委员会认真执行这次会议的各项决议。
