[Beijing News Agency News] With spring plowing about to begin, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to encourage liberated peasants and other agricultural operators in the suburbs of Beijing to actively improve and develop production after the land reform, has issued a proclamation stipulating the following reward measures:

I. State-owned land in the suburbs of the city that has been allocated to peasants for use (including land already in use before the land reform) shall, upon obtaining a state-owned land use certificate, obtain the right of long-term use.

The same shall apply to those who, with the approval of the government, develop state-owned wasteland and uncultivated alkaline land and river滩 into arable land.

II. Technical equipment (such as wells, hotbeds, warm rooms, etc.) added by state-owned land users for the purpose of increasing production shall be owned privately by them. If the municipal administration or industrial construction must take them over, the government or the user shall provide fair and reasonable compensation.

Those who implement land improvement for the purpose of increasing production (such as changing dry land into paddy fields or improving the soil, etc.) may also obtain compensation for their improvement costs in the same manner.

If the aforementioned land is voluntarily returned by the user, and the government allocates it to another person for continued use, the continued user shall be responsible for compensating it.

III. Peasants who own land privately, or who use state-owned land, shall pay agricultural tax to the government. The agricultural tax shall be levied based on the normal fixed output of the land. If the output is increased due to changing to cooperative farming and intensive cultivation, the excess part shall be exempted from taxation.

Land mentioned in Item 1, Paragraph 2 shall be exempt from agricultural tax for three years.

For the land mentioned in Item 2, Paragraph 2, if the annual output increases and the land grade is raised, agricultural tax shall still be levied according to the original grade for three years. From the fourth year onwards, it shall be revised according to the annual output of the increased land grade. If the increased harvest in three years is not enough to compensate for the land improvement costs, it may be submitted to the Municipal Government for an extension of the year of revision.

IV. In order to ensure the supply of urban people, those who manage vegetable gardens, orchards, fish ponds, and lotus root ponds shall uniformly reduce the agricultural tax by half, calculated in rice based on the annual average wholesale price of their total output, to show encouragement.

V. After the land reform, farm households with insufficient labor can still lease out their land or hire workers to operate it. The rent and wages shall be freely agreed upon by both parties.

VI. Lending and borrowing are free, and interest rates shall be freely agreed upon by both parties.

　　京市府规定具体办法
    奖励郊区农业生产
    【京市新闻处讯】春耕即将开始，京市人民政府为鼓励京郊翻身农民及其他农业经营者在土地改革后积极提高和发展生产，顷发出布告，规定奖励办法如下：
    一、本市郊区国有土地，凡已分配农民使用者（包括土地改革前已经使用之土地），在领得国有土地使用证后，即取得长期使用之权利。
    凡经政府批准、开辟国有荒地及无人耕种之碱地、河滩为良田者，与前项同。
    二、国有土地使用者，为增产而添设之技术设备（如水井、温床、暖室等）统归其私有，如市政或工业建设必须收用时，应由政府或需用者予以公平合理之补偿。
    其为增产而实行土地改良者（如改旱田为水田或改良土壤等），其改良费用，亦得以同样办法取得补偿。
    前项土地如使用者自动交回，由政府另行分配他人继续使用时，由继续使用者负责补偿之。
    三、农民私有之土地，或使用国有之土地皆向政府缴纳农业税，农业税按土地之常年固定产量计征。如因变耕互助、精耕细作而增加产量时，其超过部分免征。
    对第一条第二项之土地，免征农业税三年。
    对第二条第二项之土地，其常年产量增加，土地提高等级后，三年内仍按原有等级征收农业税。自第四年起，依提高地等之常年产量改订之。如三年内所增收获尚不足补偿土地改良费用时，得呈请本府延长其改订之年限。
    四、为保证城市人民供给，凡经营菜园、果园、渔塘、藕池者，一律按其总产量之常年平均批发价，减半折米计征农业税，以示奖励。
    五、土地改革后劳动力不足之农户，其土地仍可出租或雇工经营，地租与工资均由双方自由议定之。
    六、借贷自由，利息由双方自由约定。
