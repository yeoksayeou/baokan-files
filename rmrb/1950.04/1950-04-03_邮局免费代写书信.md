　　Post Office Offers Free Letter Writing Service
    In order to expand its services and help illiterate people solve the difficulty of writing letters, the Beijing Postal Administration has, since the first of this month, assigned personnel at its office (inside Qianmen, Gong'an Street) to write letters for illiterate soldiers, workers, farmers, military families, and working masses free of charge.  The only requirement is that those requesting the service provide their own stationery and envelopes; there are no other fees.

    北京邮政管理局为了扩大服务范围帮助不识字的群众解决写信困难，已自本月一日开始在该局（前门内公安街）派专人为不识字的军人、工人、农民、军属及劳苦大众代写书信，除了信纸信封须由托写人自备以外，不收任何费用。
