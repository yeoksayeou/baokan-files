　　The Ministry of Trade Guarantees Sufficient Supply of Goods
    Beijing's Specialized Companies Vigorously Promote Sales
    And Establish Agency Relationships with Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Surrounding Counties and Towns
    [Reported by our correspondent Feng Zhong] Beijing's grain, cotton yarn, general merchandise, coal and iron, and salt companies are reversing conservative thinking, improving management methods, and are actively promoting sales of goods in large quantities, striving to complete the task of withdrawing currency from circulation and accelerating the turnover of state funds.

    Reversing Conservative Thinking to Complete Currency Withdrawal
    In the past, some cadres in the specialized companies had conservative ideas about selling goods. Sometimes they were afraid to sell boldly, fearing that if they sold out, new goods would not arrive and they would have nothing to sell, or that the state would suffer losses if prices rose. As a result, they sometimes waited and were passive in selling goods, and there were many inconveniences in the selling procedures. Individual cadres even held the erroneous work attitude of "government business, it doesn't matter whether we sell or not." They did not understand the principle that hoarding goods without selling not only makes it difficult to control the market and stabilize prices, but also impedes the expansion of reproduction and fails to meet the needs of the masses in a timely manner, thereby affecting the people's lives. Until the beginning of last month, when the Government Administration Council issued the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," and the Central Ministry of Trade gave each specialized company a certain task of withdrawing currency from circulation, guaranteeing a sufficient supply of goods, the responsible cadres of each company gradually changed the above-mentioned thinking and actively promoted sales. In the past twenty days or so, each company has made significant achievements. From March 1st to March 28th alone, Beijing Department Store Company withdrew 11.4866 billion yuan.

    Eliminating Various Restrictions and Extending Sales Hours
    The Grain Company and the Cotton Yarn Company took the lead in abolishing restrictions such as trading in the exchange with admission permits and "bundled sales." They also no longer restricted the types and quantities of goods sold to institutions, organizations, factories, schools, and cooperatives. The Grain Company specially set up more than ten people to collect cash. Those who purchased less than 300 jin of grain could pay on the spot (previously, those who purchased more than 100 jin had to pay at the bank). The retail wholesale department of the Cotton Yarn Company also simplified transaction procedures, making it possible for customers to buy and pay for goods on the spot. The Salt Company used to sell salt in a minimum quantity of 100 jin, but now it has been reduced to 5 jin. The agency stores do not limit the quantity purchased, and payment is no longer restricted to banks, as in the past. The Coal and Iron Company can organize trucks to deliver coal to users who purchase more than 500 jin. The Department Store Company also assists out-of-town merchants in handling shipping procedures and is studying ways to deliver goods within the city.

    All companies have canceled their one-day-a-week rest day and extended their daily sales hours. The Department Store Company did not rest on the past two Mondays (March 20 and March 27), selling an additional 521.1 million yuan. The sales outlets of the Salt Company sell from 7 am to 9 pm. Each company has sent special personnel to factories, institutions, organizations, schools, and shops to actively contact and promote the sale of goods. The Coal and Iron Company has more than thirty cadres who regularly "run outside." The cadres in charge of the coal industry and the factory directors of the coal plants also regularly "go down the street" to understand the types of coal used by various parties and the opinions of customers on coal quality, transportation, etc., so that they can make improvements at any time.

    In order to reduce intermediate exploitation, each company tries to increase the number of retail stores or agency stores and provides preferential treatment and convenience to cooperatives and retail companies. The Grain Company restored the long-unused First Grain Depot and set up sales groups in Guangqumen and Dongzhimen respectively. The Dongzhimen group has increased its daily sales from 2,000-3,000 jin to more than 30,000 jin. The Guangqumen group has also increased its daily sales from more than 1,000 jin to more than 10,000 jin. In addition, two more flour retail stores have been added, and a retail store has been entrusted to a retail company, and private grain depots, stalls, and grain processing stores have been organized to sell grain on consignment. In addition to setting up a new wholesale and retail department, the Department Store Company has also established a second retail store on Qianmenwai Street. The Coal and Iron Company also tries its best to provide various conveniences to the coal shops led by retail companies, and delivers whole cars and loose cars as needed. The Cotton Yarn Company also cooperates with retail companies, based on the principle of small profits and quick turnover, and reduces the profit margin for wholesale to retail companies, and can now sell more than twice as much cloth per day as in the past.

    Regularly Send Cadres to Promote Sales in Various Counties and Towns
    The Coal and Iron, Cotton Yarn, and Salt Companies are vigorously promoting sales in counties, towns, and rural areas. The Coal and Iron Company has sent more than ten cadres to regularly contact supply and marketing cooperatives and coal merchants in counties and towns along the Jingbao, Jingjin, Jingzhang, and Jinggu railways and on both sides of the railways to sell coal. As a result, the amount of coal sold outside has greatly increased. In March alone, more than 6,000 tons of coal were sold on the Jingbao line. In addition, the price of coal in various counties and towns has been reduced, so that villagers can buy coal at reasonable prices. Through the active contact of various specialized companies with various parties, more than 90% of the supply and marketing cooperatives and coal merchants in the towns of the Jingbao and Jingjin railway lines have established agency relationships with the Beijing Coal and Iron Company; even some village cooperatives, such as the Songlindian Village Cooperative and the Xiaosizhuang Cooperative in Xushui, have also begun to sell coal on consignment. The county cooperatives and coal yards that had been in contact in the past have also increased their average sales volume by about three-fifths. The Zhuoxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative used to sell only five or six tons of coal a day, but now it can sell more than thirty tons. The Coal and Iron Company also provides the county cooperatives with weak funds with the convenience of selling on credit and paying for the goods in installments. The Cotton Yarn Company also relies on the Zhuoxian, Dingxing, Tongxian, and Nanyuan branch companies to establish agency relationships with more than 20 county and district town cooperatives and cloth merchants around Beijing. The Tongxian branch company used to sell three or four bolts of cloth a day, but now, after vigorously promoting sales in the surrounding villages and towns and selling loose cloth by the foot, it sells more than forty bolts a day. The Salt Company has also newly established agency relationships with the supply and marketing cooperatives in Liulihe, Liangxiang, Gaobeidian, Gucheng, and Dingxing on the Jinghan Line and Tongxian on the Jinggu Line. This vigorous development of sales business not only accelerates the turnover of funds, but also promotes the business skills of state-owned specialized companies in learning to do business and further improves the work of state-owned trade.

　　贸易部保证充分供应货物
    京各专业公司大力推销
    并与四乡县镇供销合作社建立代销关系
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报导：北京粮食、花纱布、百货、煤铁、盐业各专业分公司扭转保守思想，改进经营方法，正主动地大量推销货物，努力完成回笼货币的任务，加速国家资金的流转。
    扭转保守思想  完成货币回笼
    过去，各专业公司在出售货物上部分干部存在着保守思想，有时不敢大胆出售，怕卖光了以后新货到不了没的卖，或怕物价涨后国家吃亏，因而有时在出售货物上等待、被动，而且在卖货手续上还有许多不便利的地方，个别干部甚至抱着“官家买卖，卖不卖没关系”的错误的工作态度。不了解压着货不卖，不仅难以掌握市场，稳定物价，积压资金，妨碍扩大再生产，又不能及时满足群众需要，而影响人民生活的道理。直至上月初，政务院发布“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，中央贸易部给予各专业公司一定的回笼货币的任务，并保证货物充足供应以后，各公司负责干部才逐渐转变上述思想，积极主动地推销。二十余天来，各公司都有显著成绩，仅北京百货分公司由三月一日至二十八日，回笼货币即达一百十四亿八千六百余万元。
    取消各种限制  延长售货时间
    粮食分公司及花纱布分公司首先取消了在交易所凭入场证交易和“搭货”等限制，对机关、团体、工厂、学校合作社卖货也不再限制种类及数量。粮食公司专设十余人点收现款，凡购粮三百斤以下者可以当时交款（以前一百斤以上要到银行交款）。花纱布分公司门市批发部也简化交易手续，做到了顾主进门就买，当时交钱取货。盐业分公司过去卖盐要一百斤起码，现在降至五斤起码。各代销店不限购买数量，而且交款也不像过去限制非到银行不可。煤铁分公司卖煤对购买五百斤以上用户，就可以组织大车往送。百货分公司也协助外地客商办理运货手续，且正研究本市送货办法。
    各公司都取消了一周一天的休息日，延长每日卖货时间。百货分公司最近两个星期一（三月二十日及三月二十七日）未休息，多卖了五亿二千一百多万元。盐业分公司分销处由早晨七点一直卖到晚九点。各公司都派有专人，分赴工厂、机关、团体、学校及商铺主动联系推销货品。煤铁分公司就有三十多个干部经常“跑外”。煤业股负责干部和各煤厂厂长也随时“下街”，了解各方面用煤的种类以及顾主对煤质、运输等方面的意见，以便随时改进。
    为了减少中间剥削，各公司尽量增设门市部或代销店，并给予合作社及零售公司优待与便利。粮食分公司恢复了停用已久的第一粮栈，并分别在广渠门、东直门设推销组。东直门组已由开始时每天卖粮二、三千斤增到三万余斤。广渠门组也由一天卖粮一千多斤增到一万多斤。此外又增设了两个面粉门市部，另委托零售公司设一个门市部，更组织私人粮栈、摊贩及各加工粮店代销粮食。百货分公司除已新增设一处批发零售部外，又在前门外大街设立第二门市部。煤铁公司也尽量给予零售公司领导的代销煤铺种种便利，整车、零车随要随送。花纱布公司更与零售公司配合，本薄利多销原则，降低批发给零售公司的利润率，目前比过去每天可多卖布两倍以上。
    经常派出干部向各县镇推销
    煤铁、花纱布、盐业等分公司更向各县镇农村大力推销。煤铁分公司已派十余个干部经常在京保、京津、京张、京古各铁路沿线及铁路两侧县镇与各县供销合作社及煤商接洽卖煤，因之外销煤量大大增多，三月份仅在京保线就售出六千多吨煤。并且压低各县镇煤价，使乡民可以买到合理价格的煤。经过各专业公司主动地同各方联系，京保、京津各铁路线城镇供销合作社和煤商有十分之九以上都与北京煤铁分公司建立了代销关系；甚至有些村合作社，如松林店村合作社、徐水小寺各庄合作社等也都开始代销。过去已有联系的县合作社及煤栈也都增加了平均约五分之三的代销量。涿县供销合作社过去一天只能卖煤五、六吨，现在可以卖到三十多吨。煤铁分公司对资金薄弱的县合作社更给予赊销和整付用货分批付款的便利。花纱布分公司也依靠涿县、定兴、通县、南苑各支公司与北京周围二十余个县区城镇合作社及布商建立代销关系。通县支公司以前一天卖三、四匹布，现经过大力向四乡推销，并增卖零尺布后，一天卖到四十多匹。盐业公司也新与京汉线琉璃河、良乡、高碑店、固城、定兴及京古线通县等地供销合作社建立了代销关系。这一推销业务的努力开展，不仅加速了资金流转，而且也促进了国营专业公司的学会做买卖的业务技术，进一步作好国营贸易工作。
