　　Strengthen Leadership of Tax Work
    Ding County Special District Adjusts Cadres
    Cadres at All Levels Emphasize Tax Work, Taxes Increase Significantly
    [Our Newspaper] To strengthen leadership of tax work, correctly implement tax policies, and earnestly carry out the Party Central Committee's instructions on strengthening tax cadres, the Ding County Party Committee rigorously reviewed the leading cadres of tax bureaus at all levels. Before April 10th, it transferred eleven county committee members from the existing county committee organization ministers and propaganda ministers within the special district to serve as directors of tax bureaus in Ding County, An Guo, and nine other counties. It also educated all party members and cadres in the special district to strengthen their study and overcome the "benevolent government" thinking of underestimating taxation, to ensure the correct implementation of tax policies and the state's financial revenue.
    In addition, since the end of the Hebei Province tax work conference in early March, the Ding County Special Office convened a conference of cadres from various departments of the special district and local state-owned factories and enterprises on March 13th to thoroughly convey the spirit of the provincial government conference. The county governments also convened enlarged county and district conferences in mid-March, in conjunction with spring plowing and production work, to arrange work. The Ding County Party Committee also notified party committees at all levels to organize cadres to study relevant tax documents. After study and discussion, cadres at all levels ideologically began to attach importance to tax work. For example, the cadres of the Ding County Tax Bureau stationed at the state-owned coal and iron company in Ding County’s West Pass, after discussing the significance of state-owned and public-owned enterprises paying taxes, unanimously supported the instructions of the Central People's Government and inquired three times by telephone to the special district tax bureau when the tax would be levied, guaranteeing to pay taxes in advance according to regulations. After examining the past work style of not being thorough enough, they paid attention to the publicity of tax policies, then immediately conducted in-depth inspections and plugged loopholes, discovering that the twelve private waterwheel factories in Cheng Guan all had phenomena of stealing and concealing transaction taxes and stamp taxes when farmers bought waterwheels with grain. With the active efforts of cadres at all levels and the emphasis on tax work, various taxes in the special district have increased significantly since March; stamp tax alone generated an income of 97,584 jin of rice in the entire special district in March, an increase of 38,679 jin compared to January.
    In addition, twenty-nine state-owned and public-owned factories and enterprises in Ding County Cheng Guan earnestly implemented the central government's instructions. After the special district tax bureau arranged the first quarter industrial and commercial tax tasks at the end of March, they had all completed the taxable rice of more than 240,000 jin by April 8th.

　　加强税务工作的领导
    定县专区调整干部
    各级干部重视税收工作税收显著增加
    【本报讯】中共定县地委为加强税务工作的领导，正确贯彻税收政策，并认真执行党中央加强税收干部的指示，对各级税务局领导干部作了严格审查，于四月十日前已从专区内现有的县委组织部长、宣传部长中抽调十一个县委委员，分配到定县、安国等十一个县税务局担任局长，并教育全专区党员干部加强学习，克服轻视税收的“仁政”思想，以保证正确贯彻税收政策与国家的财政的收入。
    又：自三月初河北省税务工作会议结束后，定县专署即于三月十三日召集专区各部门及所在地各公营工厂企业干部会议，深入传达省府会议精神。各县县府亦结合春耕生产工作，于三月中旬先后召开县区扩大会议布置工作。中共定县地委并通知各级党委组织干部学习有关税收文件，经学习讨论后，各级干部对税收工作均从思想上重视起来。定县税务局如驻定县西关国营煤铁公司的干部，讨论了关于国营公营企业纳税意义后，一致拥护中央人民政府的指示，并三次电话询问专区税务局何时开征，保证提前照章完税。在检查了过去工作不深入的作风后，即注意了税收政策的宣传，随即深入检查、堵塞漏洞，发现了城关十二个私营水车厂，在农民以粮食买水车时，均有偷瞒交易税与印花税现象。在各级干部的积极努力和对税收工作的重视下，三月份以来，专区各种税收已显著增加；只印花税三月份全专区即收入九七、五八四斤米，比一月份增加三八、六七九斤。
    又：定县城关国营公营工厂企业二十九个单位，认真执行中央指示，在专区税务局于三月底布置第一季工商税任务后，至四月八日即全部完成应纳税米二十四万余斤。
