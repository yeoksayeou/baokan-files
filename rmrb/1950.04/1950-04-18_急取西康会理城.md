　　Quickly Capture Huili City, Xikang
    Guo Zhen
    In mid-March, a certain unit of the South Route Army of the People's Liberation Army's Southwest Military Region, in coordination with the North Route fraternal units, launched an offensive against Xichang, crossed the natural barrier of the Jinsha River, climbed Flame Mountain, and headed straight for Huili, the southeastern gateway of Xikang, in two routes. The left-wing outflanking force crossed the precipitous cliffs of Ma'an Mountain and Matou Mountain, defeated the enemy's stubborn resistance four times, and spent the whole day drilling through dense pine forests, advancing on rugged mountain roads, grabbing rocks, and climbing tree branches.
    The soldiers were plagued by hunger and fatigue. The three guides from the "Jinsha River Column" of people's guerrillas, although very familiar with the road, were also too tired to walk. But as soon as they heard gunfire, the soldiers' fighting enthusiasm was immediately boosted, their legs became stronger, and their sleepiness disappeared. They completed a hundred and sixty li of mountain march in one day and one night, reaching Zuanguo Village in Huili. The commanders and fighters had only eaten two meals in three days and had not slept for four days and four nights.
    Before the attack began, the Ninth Company, which was in charge of the assault, became particularly active. The soldiers were all very happy, and some asked in disbelief, "Is the task really given to our company?" When they were sure that the glorious task was undertaken by their company, the platoon leaders scrambled for the task: "Company Commander, it's our platoon's turn to fight." Before the platoon leaders finished arguing, the squad leaders also came to request the task. The soldiers' fatigue was gone, and they were all in high spirits, wiping their guns.
    From Zuanguo Village to Huili City was another thirty li of mountain road, which was covered in just over an hour. The soldiers raced to occupy the enemy's commanding heights and mountain strongholds. The First Platoon first used stones to open the iron lock of the city gate, entered the North Gate, and shouted while chasing along the street: "Folks, don't be afraid, the People's Liberation Army and the people are one family." Chasing to the entrance of the bandit's Second Defense Area Command, a chief of staff of the bandit army was trying to escape. The bandits were like ants on a hot pot, running around in the streets. The soldiers guarded the crossroads, capturing one who came over.
    After the First Platoon rushed to the East Gate, they concealed themselves on both sides of the city gate. A platoon of bandit troops ran over in a panic. The bayonet flashed and stretched out, and the bandit platoon leader shouted in panic: "Don't shoot, we are here to surrender our guns!" In half an hour, the Ninth Company alone captured one hundred and thirteen people.
    Huili City was thus declared liberated on March 23.

　　急取西康会理城
    郭振
    人民解放军西南军区南路大军某部于三月中旬配合北路兄弟部队对西昌发动攻势，渡过天险金沙江，爬过火焰山，分两路直奔西康东南门户会理。左翼迂回部队翻过悬崖陡壁的马鞍山、马头山，击溃敌人四次的顽抗，整日在密密的松林里钻着走，在崎岖的山路上，扒着石头、攀着树枝前进。
    战士们为饥饿疲劳侵袭着。带路的三个“金沙江纵队”的人民游击队员，虽然对这条路摸得很熟，也累得走不动了。可是只要一听见枪声，战士们的战斗热情就马上鼓舞起来，两腿也硬扎了，瞌睡也没有了，一天一夜里，完成了一百六十里的山地行军，到达会理钻锅村。指战员们三天只吃了两顿饭，四天四夜没有睡觉了。
    攻击开始前，担任突击的第九连特别活跃起来，战士们一个个高兴万分，还有人不相信似地问着：“真的任务给了咱连吗？”当他们确知光荣的任务是由他们的连担任时，排长们抢着要任务：“连长，轮也该轮到我们排打了。”排长们还没有争完，班长们也来要求任务，战士们的疲劳不知道那里去了，一个个精神抖擞地擦着枪。
    从钻锅村到会理城又是三十里山路，只一个多钟头就跑到了城郊，战士们一个赛一个地抢占了敌人的制高点、山堡。第一排首先用石块打开城门的铁锁，进入北门，在大街上一边追一边喊：“老乡们不要害怕，人民解放军和老百姓是一家人。”追到匪第二防区司令部门口，一个匪军的参谋长正夺门要逃。匪徒们像热锅上的蚂蚁，在街上乱钻乱跑。战士们就在十字路口把守着，过来一个就捉一个。
    第一排冲到东门后，掩蔽在城门两边，匪军一个排仓惶跑过来，刺刀闪亮一伸，匪军排长惊慌地喊叫：“别打，我们是来缴枪的！”在半小时内，单只第九连就俘虏了一百一十三人。
    会理城就这样地在三月二十三日宣告解放。
