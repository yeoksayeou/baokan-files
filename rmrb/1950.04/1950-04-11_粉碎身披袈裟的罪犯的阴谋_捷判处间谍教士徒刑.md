　　Crushing the Conspiracy of Criminals in Cassocks
    Czechoslovakia Sentences Espionage Priests

    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch] A comprehensive TASS Prague dispatch: The Czechoslovakian National Court publicly tried ten spies and terrorists masquerading as priests, who served the United States and the Vatican, starting on March 31st. The defendants have all confessed. On April 5th, the court announced the verdict, sentencing defendant Mastil to life imprisonment, Mahalka and Shingle to 25 years imprisonment, and Teiovsky to 20 years imprisonment. The remaining defendants were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 15 to 4 years. All property of the defendants was confiscated and nationalized.

    The trial has confirmed that defendant Mastil was a veteran Vatican spy, who received espionage training in Rome from 1937 to 1944. In 1944, he was sent to Slovakia, infiltrated the local guerrillas, and delivered intelligence about the guerrillas and the Soviet army to the Vatican. Until his arrest, he continued to engage in subversive activities against Czechoslovakia. Defendant Mahalka was a monastery abbot who, in addition to distributing anti-national leaflets, privately stored a large number of weapons in an attempt to support the anti-national riots that were uncovered last May. Defendant Shingle was the senior representative of the Jesuit Order in Czechoslovakia, and he regularly passed intelligence to the Vatican representative in Prague. Defendant Teiovsky was the abbot of the monastery in the Czech town of Libice and also secretly hid weapons. He convened a meeting in 1948 to draft a plan of action against the state. During a visit to Rome in 1947, he personally handed over secret intelligence to representatives of foreign intelligence agencies.

    Kruzhinsky, a reporter for Pravda, commented on the trial: Many monasteries within Czechoslovakia have become breeding grounds for anti-people conspiracies. Those criminals in cassocks are carrying out activities like those of Mindszenty, attempting to use foreign force to establish a Catholic empire in Central Europe, headed by descendants of the Habsburg dynasty and protected by Wall Street. Kruzhinsky quoted the Czechoslovak working people as saying: The trial of ten espionage priests is the people's trial of the Vatican—an active spy of the enemies of democracy and the imperialist warmongers.

　　粉碎身披袈裟的罪犯的阴谋
    捷判处间谍教士徒刑
    【新华社十日讯】综合塔斯社布拉格消息：捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭于三月三十一日起公开审讯了以教士身份作掩护，替美国和梵蒂冈服务的十名间谍及恐怖主义者，被告均已服罪。法庭于四月五日宣布判决，判处被告马斯提尔无期徒刑，马哈尔卡与新格尔二十五年徒刑，泰伊奥夫斯基二十年徒刑。其余被告分别被判十五年至四年徒刑，各被告全部财产均予没收充公。
    审讯业已证实：被告马斯提尔是老练的梵蒂冈间谍，从一九三七年到一九四四年都在罗马受间谍训练，一九四四年被送至斯洛伐克，钻入当地游击队，曾向梵蒂冈递送有关游击队及苏军的情报，一直到被捕以前，他仍从事颠覆捷克斯洛伐克的活动。被告马哈尔卡是一个修道院院长，他除了散发反国家的传单外，并私藏大批武器，企图支援在去年五月被破获的反国家暴动。被告新格尔是耶稣会驻捷高级代表，他经常以谍报交给梵蒂冈驻布拉格代表。被告泰伊奥夫斯基是捷立夫地方的修道院院长，也秘密藏有武器；他曾在一九四八年召开会议，拟就反国家的行动计划，他于一九四七年访问罗马时，曾亲将秘密情报交与外国谍报机关代表。
    真理报记者克鲁辛斯基就此次审讯发表评论称：捷克斯洛伐克境内许多修道会已成为反人民阴谋的温床，那些身披袈裟的罪犯，进行和明曾蒂一样的活动，想借外国武力在中欧建立一个以哈布斯堡王朝的后裔为首，而受华尔街保护的天主教帝国。克鲁辛斯基引用捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的谈话称：审讯十个间谍教士，就是人民审讯了梵蒂冈——这个民主的敌人和帝国主义战争贩子的积极间谍。
