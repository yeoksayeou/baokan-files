According to a notice from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture: In March, rinderpest was discovered in some villages in Xiangning, Fencheng, Jie County, and Jiaocheng counties in Shanxi Province, resulting in the deaths of more than 400 head of draught animals. In addition, since the beginning of spring, swine fever has been found in parts of Wenshui, Dingxiang, Taigu, Xinxian, Jinyuan, and Fenyang counties. Chicken plague is also prevalent in Qi County and Xugou. After receiving the report, the provincial government first instructed all localities to organize veterinarians to lead the masses in prevention and isolation, and then dispatched technical personnel to the epidemic areas to organize the masses for emergency treatment. At the same time, 84 cadres from the Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Institute and students from the veterinary training class were transferred to form six prevention teams and seventeen groups, which were sent to 27 counties including Heshun, Qinyuan, and Anze on March 16 to carry out preventive inoculation of 206,000 head of draught animals with emphasis. For infectious diseases of pigs and chickens, the focus is on organizing local veterinarians to leverage the mass prevention experience, while providing scientific technology and drug assistance to achieve the rapid eradication of livestock epidemics. The Department of Agriculture also requires all localities to do a good job in reporting epidemics. If there are animal diseases, detailed reports must be made on the date of onset and symptoms; at the same time, instructions were also given on the common sense of livestock health care and disease prevention.
