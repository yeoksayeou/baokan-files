　　Fisheries Briefs
　　East China
　　The East China Military and Political Committee's Aquatic Products Bureau held the first East China Regional Aquatic Products Conference in Shanghai from March 25th to April 2nd. More than 30 representatives from various provinces, regions, and aquatic product companies attended. Based on the resolutions of the National Fisheries Conference, the meeting formulated draft plans for the 1950 East China Regional Aquatic Products Work Plan, aquatic product laws and regulations, general rules for aquatic product administrative organizations at all levels, fish resource cultivation, and fish fry protection instructions. Fang Yuan, Deputy Director of the East China Aquatic Products Bureau, pointed out in his concluding remarks that this year's aquatic product policy in East China is to systematically establish aquatic product organizational structures, mobilize and organize fishermen, and restore fisheries production in a focused and planned manner; break the enemy's maritime blockade and strive for comprehensive fish production; in order to successfully complete this year's annual production tasks for the East China region, which include 224,700 tons of fish, 21 tons of cod liver oil, 750,000 pounds of white coir rope, 25,050 tons of machine-made ice, and the cultivation of 130 million freshwater fish.
　　The People's Bank of China's East China Branch will focus on providing fisheries loans worth 25 million catties of millet to support the restoration of fisheries production, freshwater aquaculture, processing, transportation, and sales.
　　The Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture plans to restore fisheries production to 91% of the pre-war production level this year. The fisheries production plan formulated by the Department of Agriculture stipulates an annual fish production of 1,630,800 dan, an increase of more than 32% compared to last year. In the restoration work, Jiaodong, one of the three major fishing grounds in the country, will be the focus.
　　Northeast
　　At the end of January this year, the Liaoxi Branch of the Northeast Bank allocated 18 billion Northeast currency in the form of goods and cash to help fishermen in Qinhuangdao City and five counties including Suizhong and Jinxi, who were experiencing more difficulties, so that they could prepare and add fishing tools and equipment as early as possible. As a result of these measures, the amount of fish caught by fishermen since going to sea has greatly increased. For example, Suizhong Sanhekou had only 16 net shops (fishing units) and more than 500 nets last year, but this year it has increased to 21 net shops. On the first day of going to sea in early March, the average shrimp catch per net increased by a quarter compared to last year.
　　This year, the coastal fishing areas of Liaodong Province have a total of more than 14,000 fishermen, 3,400 fishing boats, and 18,000 fishing nets, most of which appeared in the two major fishing grounds of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea in early March, catching Chinese shrimp, mullet, etc. The province issued 25 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in loans earlier this year, and most of it was issued in kind at low prices. In addition, with the government's support last year, the fishermen's enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. At present, most fishing boats are fully equipped and have abundant material conditions.
　　Public and private fishing boats in the Lushun-Dalian area went to sea one after another as early as January. Fishing boats under the jurisdiction of the Guandong Aquatic Products Company have caught 514 tons of fish in the one and a half months since January this year, doubling the amount in the same period last year. In order to help coastal fishermen go to sea to fish in a timely manner, the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office also lent fishermen 30 million Guandong currency this spring.
　　In order to facilitate fishermen's sales, the Liaoxi Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has now established four aquatic product companies, and at the same time, it is assisting in the establishment and improvement of coastal fishermen's cooperatives. Many aquatic product markets have been established in coastal areas of Liaodong. Aquatic product companies and cooperatives in various cities and counties are also actively preparing funds and materials, and plan to organize the sale of fresh fish, refrigerate or process them to expand sales channels.
　　Central and South
　　The Fisheries Company affiliated to the Jiangxi Provincial Trade Company is actively helping fishermen along Poyang Lake to quickly resume production. According to statistics, the company lent more than 70,000 catties of grain and more than 74,000 catties of edible salt from September to December last year; it helped fishermen repair 501 fishing boats and more than 1,000 large and small fishing nets, thus enabling about 4,800 fishermen in 21 villages along the lake to reorganize and engage in fisheries production. As of mid-February, the Fisheries Company had purchased more than 110,000 catties of salted fish, initially solving the fishermen's production and sales problems.

　　渔业简讯
    华东
    华东军政委员会水产管理局于三月二十五日至四月二日在沪举行华东区第一次水产会议，到各省、区代表和各水产公司等代表共三十余人。会议根据全国渔业会议的决议制定了一九五○年华东区水产工作计划、水产法令、各级水产行政组织通则、培养鱼源、保护鱼苗指示等草案。华东水产管理局副局长方原会上总结时指出：华东区今年的水产方针是有系统地建立水产组织机构，发动与组织渔民，有重点有计划地恢复渔业生产；打破敌人海上封锁，争取全面出鱼；以求顺利完成今年华东区全年捕鱼二十二万四千七百吨，生产鱼肝油二十一吨、白棕绳七十五万磅、制机冰二万五千零五十吨、养殖一亿三千万尾淡水鱼的生产任务。
    人民银行华东区行将有重点地贷放价值二千五百万斤小米的渔业贷款，以扶助恢复渔业生产、淡水养殖、加工运销等。
    山东省人民政府农业厅计划今年渔业生产恢复至战前生产水平的百分之九十一强。农业厅制订的今年渔业生产计划规定全年产鱼一、六三○、八○○担，较去年增产百分之三十二强。在恢复工作中将以全国三大渔场之一的胶东为重点。
    东北
    今年一月末，东北银行辽西分行曾拨发一百八十亿元东北币的实物及现款，帮助了困难较多的山海关市及绥中、锦西等五县的渔民，使他们及早地准备好并添置了捕鱼的工具和设备。由于这些措施的结果，渔民下海以来捕鱼量大为增加。如绥中三河口去年仅有十六个网铺（捕鱼单位），五百余张网，今年则增加到二十一户网铺。三月初下海第一天，平均每网打虾即比去年增加四分之一。
    辽东省沿海渔区今年共有一万四千余渔民、三千四百只渔船、一万八千张渔网，其中绝大部分在三月初即已出现在渤海、黄海的两大渔场，捕捉青虾、鮻鱼等。该省今年提早发放二百五十亿元（东北币）贷款，并大部低价发给实物，加以去年在政府扶助下，渔民生产积极性大增。目前一般渔船均装备齐全，物质条件极为充足。
    旅大区公私营渔船，早于一月间即纷纷下海。关东水产公司所辖渔船，从今年一月起的一个半月中，已捕鱼五百十四吨，较去年的同一时期增加一倍。旅大行政公署为了扶助沿海渔民及时下海捕鱼，今春亦贷给渔民关东币三千万元。
    为了便利渔民推销，现辽西省水产局已成立了四个水产公司，同时并协助建立和健全沿海渔民合作社。辽东沿海各地已成立水产市场多处，各市县水产公司与合作社亦积极准备资金与物资，计划组织出售鲜鱼、冷藏或加工，以扩大销路。
    中南
    江西省贸易公司所属渔业公司积极扶助鄱阳湖沿湖渔民迅速恢复生产。据统计，该公司自去年九月至十二月，共贷出粮食七万余斤，食盐七万四千余斤；帮助渔民修补渔船五○一只和大小渔网一千余个，因而使沿湖二十一个村约四千八百余渔民重新组织起来从事渔业生产。截至二月中旬，渔业公司已收购咸鱼十一万余斤，初步解决了渔民的产销问题。
