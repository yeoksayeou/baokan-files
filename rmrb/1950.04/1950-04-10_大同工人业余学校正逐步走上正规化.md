　　Datong Workers' Spare-Time School Gradually Becomes Regularized
    [Our newspaper dispatch] In Datong City, Chahar Province, nineteen enterprises have established workers' spare-time schools. In the past two months, spare-time schools in ten units have become regularized: classes have been divided, systems such as leave of absence and roll call have been established, timetables and progress schedules have been drawn up, teachers have been hired, and issues such as study time and funding have been resolved. There are 264 workers who consistently persist in studying. Kouquan Coal Mine has even begun to adopt the method of holding classes at the pithead, organizing workers to study for forty minutes before starting work. The main shortcomings in the city's workers' education are that in the past two months, democratic movements have involved many meetings, taking up the workers' study time; and the leading cadres of some enterprises (such as Datong Machine Factory) do not pay enough attention to workers' spare-time education, causing some spare-time schools to remain irregular.

　　大同工人业余学校正逐步走上正规化
    【本报讯】察哈尔省大同市已有十九个企业单位建立了工人业余学校。在最近两个月中，有十个单位的业余学校已走上正规化：分编了班次，建立了请假、点名等制度，订立了课程表和进度表，聘请了教员，解决了学习时间与经费等问题。经常坚持学习的工人有二百六十四人。口泉煤矿并开始采取井口上课的方法，在上班前组织工人学习四十分钟。该市工人教育中的主要缺点，是两月来搞民主运动开会较多，占去了工人的学习时间；而且有一部分企业（如大同机器厂）的领导干部对工人业余教育重视不够，使一部分业余学校仍未走上正规。（察省总工会文教部）
