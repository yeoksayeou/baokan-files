Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 26th: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party have recently passed a decision on the procedures for implementing the plan to plant agricultural shelterbelts. This famous plan for transforming nature, promulgated in August 1948 by the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, stipulates "planting agricultural shelterbelts, implementing grass-arable rotation, and constructing ponds and reservoirs to ensure abundant harvests every year in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union."

According to TASS, Moscow, April 21st: The decision on implementation procedures passed by the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party describes the execution of afforestation on the lands of state forest areas, collective farms, and state farms, pointing out that many forest bureaus, collective farms, and state farms in the European part of the Soviet Union have greatly exceeded their tasks.

From 1948 to 1949, collective farms, state farms, and forestry farms in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union planted a total of 590,000 hectares of shelterbelts, of which 373,400 hectares were planted in 1949. As of April 15th this year, the area completed for afforestation has reached 306,800 hectares, accounting for 44 percent of this year's plan.

The decision goes on to point out: Regarding the establishment of national shelterbelts, the work has been largely completed on the designated 111,800 hectares of land by April 15th this year. Last year, a plan was drawn up to plant six shelterbelts, and land surveying work was completed on more than 400,000 hectares. Afforestation central stations, steppe forestry bureaus, and state forestry bureaus have been organized and equipped with tractors and special agricultural machines and tools.

The decision approved the plan to complete afforestation of 700,000 hectares in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union this year (the 1948 plan stipulated only 425,300 hectares), and stipulated that this spring, all areas should use cluster seeding methods for sowing.

The decision emphasized that last year, the forestry farms and afforestation central stations under the Soviet Ministry of Forestry completed the work of planting trees on shifting sands to fix them. The afforestation area reached 32,800 hectares, or 146 percent of the plan. Last year, 67,200 tons of tree and shrub seeds were stored, or 127 percent of the plan. Six billion seedlings were cultivated, or 110 percent of the plan. Last year, perennial grasses were sown on 2.4 million hectares of land in collective farms and state farms in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, which is almost twice as much as in 1948.

The decision also stated that last year, collective farms and state farms in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union completed a large amount of work in developing irrigation systems and building ponds and reservoirs. As of April 15th this year, several canals have been dug to irrigate 55,000 hectares of land in the Central Black Earth Region, and 67,700 hectares of land in other steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union. River irrigation has been restored on more than 6,000 hectares of land. 4,579 ponds and reservoirs have been built, which is 1,767 more ponds and reservoirs than were built in 1948. At the same time, 3,658 ponds and reservoirs have been repaired and restored, and a plan has been drawn up to build 4,010 ponds and reservoirs.

According to the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, 7,085 ponds and reservoirs will be built in collective farms and 502 such ponds will be built in state farms this year. 88,800 hectares of irrigated land will be cultivated. River irrigation will be restored on 15,600 hectares of land, and new canals will be dug on 23,500 hectares of land.

The decision pointed out that in terms of mechanization of agricultural work, afforestation, and the construction of ponds and reservoirs, 119 afforestation central stations were established last year, receiving a total of 5,139 tractors, 5,143 tractor plows, 4,095 cultivators and furrowing plows, and 3,694 tree planting machines and seed drills. This year, it is planned to establish 190 new afforestation central stations.

　　实现斯大林改造自然伟大计划
    苏种植防护林带超过任务
    部长会议及联共中央通过植林计划履行程序决定
    苏联欧洲部分草原地带今年将植林七十万公顷
    【新华社二十六日讯】苏联部长会议及联共中央顷就种植农田防护林带的计划通过履行程序的决定。这一著名的改造自然的计划，于一九四八年八月由苏联部长会议与联共中央颁布，规定“种植农田防护林带，实行牧草轮种制，建造池塘与蓄水池，以保证苏联欧洲部分草原区与森林草原区年年丰收”。
    据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联部长会议与联共中央通过的履行程序的决定，叙述了在国家森林区、集体农场与国营农场的土地上造林的执行情况，指出在苏联欧洲部分的许多森林局、集体农场与国营农场已大大超过了任务。
    在一九四八到一九四九年，苏联欧洲部分草原区与森林草原区的集体农场、国营农场和林场，一共种植了五十九万公顷的防护林带，其中的三十七万三千四百公顷是一九四九年种的。到今年四月十五日止，完成植林的面积已达三十万六千八百公顷，为今年计划的百分之四十四。
    决定继而指出：关于建立国家防护林带的工作，到今年四月十五日，已在指定的十一万一千八百余公顷的土地上大体完成。在去年，曾经拟订了种植六个防护林带的计划，并且在四十余万公顷的地面上完成了土地测量工作。造林中心站、草原森林局和国家养林局已经组织起来，并且配备有拖拉机和特殊的农业机器与工具。
    决定批准今年完成在苏联欧洲部分的草原区与森林草原区造林七十万公顷的计划（一九四八年计划规定的仅是四十二万五千三百公顷），又规定今年春天各处都利用种子簇种法进行播种等。
    决定强调称：去年，苏联林业部所属的林场和造林中心站，已完成了在流沙上面植树，以使流沙固着的工作。植树面积达三万二千八百公顷，即计划的百分之一百四十六。去年储备了六万七千二百吨树木与灌木种籽，即计划的百分之一百二十七。培植了六十亿株幼树，即计划的百分之一百一十。去年，在苏联欧洲部分的草原区和森林草原区的集体农场和国家农场二百四十万公顷的地面上，播种了多年生草类，即将近一九四八年的两倍。
    决定又称：去年苏联欧洲部分的草原区和森林草原区中的集体农场和国家农场，在发展灌溉系统和建筑池塘与蓄水池方面，完成了大量的工作。截至今年四月十五日止，已经开凿了若干运河，用以灌溉中央黑土地带五万五千公顷的土地，以及其他苏联欧洲部分草原区及森林草原区的六万七千七百公顷的土地。在六千多公顷的土地上恢复了河水灌溉。并建筑了四千五百七十九个池塘和蓄水池，较一九四八年多建一千七百六十七个池塘和蓄水池。同时还修缮和恢复了三千六百五十八个池塘和蓄水池，并且拟订了建造四千零十个池塘与蓄水池的计划。
    按照苏联部长会议与联共中央的决定，今年内要在集体农场建造七千零八十五个池塘与蓄水池，在国家农场建造五百零二个这种池塘，要耕耘八万八千八百公顷已灌溉的土地，要在一万五千六百公顷的土地上恢复河水灌溉，并且在二万三千五百公顷的土地上挖掘新河渠。
    决定指出：在农业工作、造林与池塘及蓄水池之建造的机械化方面，去年已成立了一百一十九个造林中心站，共领到五千一百三十九架拖拉机，五千一百四十三架拖拉机用犁，四千零九十五架耕耘机和削土犁，三千六百九十四架植树机和树种条播机。今年规定成立一百九十一个新的造林中心站。
