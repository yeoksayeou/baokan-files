　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Under the plunder of the British colonialists, Malaya continues to be a US dollar manufacturing plant for Britain. According to statistics from British and American newspapers, Malaya exported a total of 899,000 tons of rubber last year, of which 371,000 tons were exported to the United States; and 54,000 tons of tin, of which 43,000 tons were exported to the United States. In these two important exports, rubber alone earned a large amount of US dollar income for Britain. According to a Reuters dispatch on March 4, British Rubber Development Bureau Deputy Director Jagoe declared: "Last year, the net US dollar income that the United Kingdom obtained from Malayan rubber exports was 200 million US dollars, which is almost equal to the total US dollar income from the United Kingdom's exports of goods."

    以马来亚橡胶赚得大宗美元
    【新华社三日讯】在英国殖民者的掠夺下，马来亚继续成为英国的美元制造工厂。据英美报纸的统计，在去年一年中，马来亚共输出橡胶八十九万九千吨，其中三十七万一千吨输至美国；输出锡五万四千吨，其中四万三千吨输至美国。在这两项重要输出中，仅橡胶一项，即给英国赚得了大宗的美元收入。据路透社三月四日电引英国橡胶开发局副局长贾戈宣称：“去年英国自马来亚橡胶输出中所得的纯美元收入为两亿美元，几等于联合王国输出物品的美元收入总额”。
