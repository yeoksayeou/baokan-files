　　The Financial System of the Soviet State
    ——A Lecture Broadcast on the Evening of April 3rd on the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing
    Bao De Lie Fu, Master of Economics from the Soviet Union
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Bao De Lie Fu, a Master of Economics from the Soviet Union who was invited by the All-China Soviet Friendship Association to give lectures in China, broadcast a lecture on "The Financial System of the Soviet State" on the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing on the evening of the 3rd. The full text is as follows:

    The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, the era of socialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and its great leaders, Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people eliminated all exploiting classes, established a new state system, and built a socialist society.

    In the great transformations accomplished in the Soviet land, the financial system played a huge role. From the very first days after the victory of the socialist revolution, in destroying the old Tsarist financial institutions and building new Soviet financial organs, the Communist Party and the Soviet government extensively and successfully utilized finance to attack private capital, expropriate the exploiters, and build a socialist economy.

    Soviet finance is fundamentally different from the finance of bourgeois countries. This is due to the fundamental differences in the nature and functions of the Soviet state and the bourgeois state. The bourgeois state does not fulfill any function of organizing and leading the national economy. Economic activity is carried out by capitalists who own all the means of production. The bourgeois state is merely a machine to support the rule of the bourgeoisie and protect the private ownership of the means of production.

    On the other hand, the bourgeois state is used by the bourgeoisie to wage wars to re-divide the world, through methods of encroaching on the territory of other countries.

    Therefore, finance under capitalism is used to maintain the bourgeoisie's oppressive machine and to fund wars to re-divide the world.

    The situation in the Soviet state is completely different. The economic foundation of socialist society is the socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production.

    This means that under socialism, factories, land, underground resources, etc., do not belong to individual capitalists and landlords, that is, they are not privately owned, but are socialist public property. Workers and peasants do not work for capitalists and landlords who exploit their labor, but for the benefit of the whole society. All production has one purpose, which is to systematically improve the material and cultural welfare of the laborers.

    The role and tasks of Soviet finance are completely determined by the nature of the Soviet state and its functions. The Soviet state is the state of workers and peasants, in which the working class realizes its dictatorship based on a firm alliance with the peasants.

    In the first few years after the great October Socialist Revolution, the national economy of the Soviet state, alongside the socialist sector, still retained a small commodity sector. This small commodity sector consisted of handicraftsmen and small individual businesses, which predominated in the countryside at that time. In addition, a large amount of private capital existed at that time. During this period, the development of Soviet society was based on the struggle between socialist and capitalist components. Under these conditions, the tasks of the Soviet state were different from the tasks that occurred later, when the capitalist classes had been completely eliminated and the socialist system had occupied a dominant position in cities and villages.

    Due to these changes in the economy and social class structure, and in the tasks of the Soviet state, Comrade Stalin pointed out at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1939 that since the October Revolution, the Soviet socialist state had experienced two stages in its development.

    In the first stage, from the October Revolution to the elimination of the exploiting classes, the first function of the Soviet state was to suppress the overthrown exploiting classes. Under the conditions of capitalist encirclement, the second function of the Soviet state was to defend the country from foreign attacks. Because since the earliest days of the revolution, the ownership of basic means of production, and the leadership of the entire socialist construction cause, were in the hands of the Soviet state, the third function of the Soviet state was the function of economic organization and cultural education.

    With the completion of socialism and the complete elimination of the capitalist classes, the Soviet state entered the second stage of its development. Its functions, in accordance with changes in the economic system and social class composition, also underwent essential changes. In the second stage, with the complete elimination of the capitalist classes, the function of suppressing these classes disappeared. Thus, a new function emerged, which was to protect socialist property from theft and damage by the people. The function of national defense was fully retained because capitalist encirclement still existed and the danger of military aggression still existed.

    Under the conditions that the socialist economic system occupied an absolute dominant position in cities and villages, and under the conditions of huge cultural upsurges, the functions of economic organization and cultural education of the Soviet state organs obtained full development. This function has now become the basic function and the most important function of the Soviet state.

    According to the different stages of the Soviet state, finance also played different roles. For example, in the first stage of the Soviet state's development, finance played a significant role in restricting, squeezing out, and even accelerating the elimination of capitalist elements in urban and rural areas. This was achieved by imposing heavy taxes on their income and property. At this time, finance was also a tool to mobilize the necessary funds to complete the Stalin Five-Year Plans and to transform the Soviet state into a powerful industrial power. The Soviet state gave the peasants extensive financial assistance. It used finance to consolidate the alliance of the working class and the peasants. The method was to subsidize the equipping of agriculture with the latest technology. On this basis, agricultural collectivization was launched, and under the leadership of the working-class party, the innovation work of transforming small-scale individual farms into large-scale socialized production was realized.

    Finance played a significant role in the development of socio-cultural measures. During the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet state educated about 35 million semi-literate and illiterate people. In the two Stalin Five-Year Plans, 522,000 young experts graduated from universities, and 931,000 young experts graduated from secondary specialized schools. By 1940, the Soviet Union had changed from a backward country with low culture to the only country in the world without illiteracy, and to a highly advanced cultural country. Soviet finance guaranteed the expansion of socialist production for the benefit of the laborers, and guaranteed the development of cultural organs, health care organs, public utilities, and public housing. It served the purpose of continuously raising the material and cultural level of the laborers.

    Secondly, Soviet finance was also used to consolidate the friendly cooperation between various nationalities and to promote the economic and cultural development of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    Finally, Soviet finance also ensured the mobilization and use of the necessary resources to support state institutions, and to supply and equip the Soviet army and navy, and to promote the consolidation of the Soviet state, its independence, and its defense forces.

    In this way, Soviet finance bears the mission of supplying the diverse needs of socialist society and its economy. Therefore, the Soviet Union formed a complete and highly efficient financial system, and each of its links has a special function of funding socialist construction and mobilizing funds for this purpose.

    The state budget of the Soviet Union occupies the central position of the Soviet financial system. The income of socialist enterprises and socialist organizations, as well as the funds of the people that are mobilized by the state into the financial system to meet social needs, are mostly channeled through the state budget. All basic measures of the national economy, socio-cultural construction (education, health care), as well as the expenses of state administration and national defense, rely on these reserve funds to be realized.

    The second link in the Soviet financial system is the banks for long-term investment. Through these banks, the Soviet state carries out the construction of new enterprises, such as the construction of factories, public utilities, and the development of agriculture. There are a total of four specialized banks. All funds used for the construction of new enterprises, whether allocated according to the budget or the economic organizations' own funds for these purposes, are concentrated in these four banks.

    The third link in the Soviet financial system is the monetary reserve fund for social insurance. Material assistance for wage laborers who temporarily or permanently lose their ability to work, that is, when they are sick or disabled, is paid from this fund.

    The fourth link in the Soviet financial system is the state insurance fund. Losses in the national economy caused by natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, etc., are compensated by this fund. Insurance for workers who suffer misfortune, death, or disability is also paid from this fund.

    A special link in the Soviet financial system is the state savings bank. Its mission is to promote the accumulation of laborers' savings and to promote the mobilization of these savings and temporary idle funds of the people.

    The sixth link in the Soviet financial system is the Soviet State Bank. The State Bank is the center of short-term loans in the Soviet Union. It carries out all settlements between socialist enterprises and socialist organizations, realizes settlements with foreign countries, and issues currency.

    Finally, the finances of the various sectors and enterprises of the socialist economy are also directly linked to the financial system of the Soviet state.

    All the links of the Soviet financial system mentioned above are integral parts of a unified financial system. This unity is determined by the fact that the economic foundation of Soviet finance is the socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production. At the same time, the Soviet financial system also has a unified political foundation because, whether in the central or local areas, state power is in the hands of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies, and the activities of these Soviets are subject to a single goal – building a classless communist society.

    The Soviet financial system is the most perfect and solid financial system in the world. This has been clearly demonstrated during the years of the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet financial system was established under the direct leadership of the great human genius Comrade Stalin. During these years, it completely guaranteed the huge expenses used for waging war, meeting the needs of the national economy, and further developing culture.

　　苏维埃国家的财政制度
    ——四月三日晚在北京中央人民广播电台播讲
    苏联经济学硕士  包德列夫
    【新华社讯】应中苏友好协会总会邀请来中国讲学的苏联经济学硕士包德列夫，三日晚在北京中央人民广播电台播讲“苏维埃国家的财政制度”，全文如下：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命揭开了人类历史上的一个新时代，社会主义的时代。苏维埃人民，在共产党及其伟大领袖列宁、斯大林的领导下，消灭了各剥削阶级，建立了新的国家制度，建成了社会主义的社会。
    在苏维埃国土所完成的伟大革新中，财政制度曾起了巨大的作用。自社会主义革命胜利后头几天起，在摧毁旧的沙皇财政机构和建设新的苏维埃财政机关的过程中，共产党和苏维埃政府曾经广泛而成功地利用财政，来进攻私人资本，剥夺剥削者，建设社会主义经济。
    苏维埃财政是和资产阶级国家的财政根本不同的。这是由于苏维埃国家和资产阶级国家在本性和职能上的根本区别而来的。资产阶级国家并没有实现国民经济组织和领导的任何职能。经济活动是由占有一切生产资料的资本家来实行的。资产阶级国家只不过是支持资产阶级统治，保护生产资料私人占有制的一架机器罢了。
    另一方面，资产阶级国家是被资产阶级利用来进行再分割世界的战争的，其方法就是侵夺他国的领土。
    因此，资本主义之下的财政，乃是用以维持资产阶级的压迫机器，资助再分割世界的战争。
    苏维埃国家里的情况就完全不同了。社会主义社会的经济基础乃是社会主义的经济体系及生产资料的社会主义所有制。
    这就是说，在社会主义之下，工厂、土地、地下蕴藏等等，不是属于个别资本家和地主的，也就是说不是私人所有的，而是社会主义公共财产。工人们和农民们不是为了剥削他们劳动的资本家和地主而工作的，而是为了整个社会的利益而工作的。一切生产都具有一个目的，那便是有步骤地提高劳动者们的物质福利和文化福利。
    苏维埃财政的作用和任务，是完全由苏维埃国家的本性和其职能所决定的。苏维埃国家乃是工人和农民的国家，在这个国家里，工人阶级是根据同农民的牢固联盟来实现自己的专政的。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命后最初几年，苏维埃国家的国民经济中，与社会主义部分并列的，还保留着小商品的部分。这种小商品部分便是手工业者以及微小的个体经营，后者在那个时期是在农村中占优势的。除此以外，那时还存在着大量的私人资本。在这个时期，苏维埃社会的发展是在社会主义成份与资本主义成份斗争的基础上进行的。在这些条件下，苏维埃国家的任务是和以后所发生的任务不同的，这时资本主义阶级已被完全消灭了，社会主义制度已在城市和乡村里占据统治地位了。
    由于经济中及社会阶级结构中的这些变化及苏维埃国家任务的变化，斯大林同志于一九三九年在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上曾经指出说，自十月革命以来，苏维埃社会主义国家在自己的发展中曾经历两个阶段。
    在第一个阶段里，即从十月革命起到剥削阶级的消灭止，苏维埃国家的第一个职能乃是镇压被推翻了的剥削阶级。在资本主义包围的条件下，苏维埃国家的第二个职能乃是保卫国土，免受外来的袭击。因为自革命的最初几天起，基本生产资料的所有，以及社会主义建设整个事业的领导，是操在苏维埃国家的手中，所以苏维埃国家的第三个职能曾是经济组织的职能和文化教育的职能。
    随着社会主义的建成以及资本主义各阶级的完全消灭，苏维埃国家进入了自己发展的第二个阶段。它的职能，依照经济制度中及社会阶级结成上的变化，在本质上也起了变化。在第二个阶段里，随着资本主义各阶级的完全消灭，镇压这些阶级的职能便消失了。从而，就出现了一个新的职能，这便是保护社会主义财产，以免人民遭受盗窃和损害。国防的职能完全保留下来了，因为资本主义包围还保存着，军事进攻的危险也还存在着。
    在社会主义经济制度在城市和乡村占绝对统治的条件下，在文化巨大高涨的条件下，苏维埃国家各机关的经济组织和文化教育工作的职能，就获得了充分的发展。这一项职能，在现时已成为苏维埃国家的基本职能和最重要的职能了。
    按照苏维埃国家的不同阶段，财政也起了不同的作用。譬如，在苏维埃国家发展的第一个阶段上，财政在城乡资本主义成份的限制、排挤上、乃至以后在消灭它们的过程的加速上，都起了重大的作用。以对它们的收入和财产课以重税，用这个方法来达到这一点。在这个时候，财政也是动员必需资金来完成斯大林五年计划，来改变苏维埃国家成为强大的工业强国的工具。苏维埃国家给了农民以广泛的财政上的援助，它利用财政来巩固工人阶级和农民的联盟。其办法就是资助用最新技术去装备农业。在这个基础上，便展开了农业集体化，并在工人阶级政党的领导下，实现了把小规模个体农场变成大规模社会化生产的革新工作。
    在社会文化措施的开展中，财政起着重大的作用。在第一次五年计划诸年中，苏维埃国家便教育了三千五百万左右的半文盲与文盲。在两个斯大林五年计划中，曾有五十二万二千青年专家在高等学校毕业，曾有九十三万一千青年专家在中等专门学校毕业。至一九四○年，苏维埃联盟已从一个落后的、文化低的国家，变成为全世界唯一无文盲的国家，变成为高度的先进的文化的国家了。苏维埃财政保证了社会主义生产的扩展，以谋劳动者的利益，保证了文化机关、保健机关、公用事业及公用住宅等的发展，它是为了不断提高劳动者物质福利和文化水平之目的而服务的。
    其次，苏联财政还用以巩固各民族间的友好合作，促进苏联各族人民在经济和文化上的发展。
    最后，苏维埃财政还保证动员并使用必要的资源，来供养国家机构，并供给和装备苏维埃军队及海军，促进苏维埃国家，以及它的独立和国防力量的巩固。
    这样，苏维埃财政便负有供应社会主义社会及其经济各种各样需要的使命。因此，苏联便形成了一种完整的并有高度效率的财政制度，它的每一个环节，都有资助社会主义建设及为此目的而动员资金的特殊职能。
    苏联的国家预算，占着苏维埃财政制度的中心地位。社会主义企业、社会主义组织的收入、以及由国家为了满足社会需要而动员到财政制度内的人民的资金等等，其大部分人都是通过国家预算的。国民经济、社会文化建设（教育，保健）等方面的一切基本措施的经费，以及国家行政与国防的经费，都是仰赖于这些后备资金来实现的。
    苏联财政制度体系的第二个环节，乃是长期投资的银行。苏维埃国家通过这些银行实行新企业的建设，比如建设工厂、公用事业、发展农业等。一共有四个专门银行，凡用于新企业建设的资金，不管是按预算拨来的也好，或是各经济组织用于这些目的的本身的资金也好，都是集中在这四个银行里。
    苏联财政体系的第三个环节是社会保险的货币后备基金。凡工资劳动者暂时或永久失去劳动能力，即他们生病或残废时的物资接济，都是从这个基金支出的。
    苏联财政体系的第四个环节，乃是国家保险基金，国民经济中因天灾而受的损失，如水灾、地震等都是用这个资金来补偿的，劳动者遭受不幸、死亡、残废的保险，也是用这笔基金的。
    苏联财政体系的一个特殊环节是国家储蓄银行。它所负的使命乃是促进劳动者储蓄的积累、促进人民这些储蓄和临时游资的动员。
    苏联财政体系的第六个环节是苏联国家银行。国家银行在苏联乃是短期贷款的中心。它实现社会主义企业、社会主义组织间一切结算，实现与外国的结算，并发行货币。
    最后，社会主义经济各部门、各企业的财政，也是同苏维埃国家财政体系直接地联系着的。
    所有上面所举苏联财政体系的环节，都是统一的财政制度的组成部分。这个统一是由下面这种情形决定的，这就是苏维埃财政的经济基础是社会主义经济制度以及生产资料的社会主义所有制。同时，苏联财政制度还有着统一的政治基础，因为不论在中央或在地方，国家政权都操于劳动者代表苏维埃手中，而这些苏维埃的活动都服从一个单一的目标——建成无阶级的共产主义社会。
    苏维埃财政制度是全世界最完善、最牢固的财政制度。这一点在伟大的卫国战争诸年间已经明显地证明出来了。苏联财政制度是在伟大的人类天才斯大林同志直接领导下建立起来的，在这些年内，它完满地保证了用于进行战争，满足国民经济需要以及进一步发展文化的巨量费用。
