Shangrao Concentration Camp
    Shao Yu

    In 1941, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army of more than 200,000 men perfidiously attacked the more than 10,000 men of the New Fourth Army's Southern Anhui troops, who persisted in fighting hard in the enemy's rear on both sides of the Yangtze River, creating the Anhui Incident that shocked China and foreign countries. Many captured New Fourth Army soldiers were imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. Comrade Shao Yu was one of the patriotic people imprisoned at that time. He used his skillful brushstrokes, with strong hatred and love, to depict the facts he witnessed that day, forming the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" collection of paintings. The monstrous crimes of the Kuomintang secret service bandit gang and the heroic deeds of the revolutionary fighters who would rather die than submit are all powerfully expressed. This collection contains a total of twenty-three works, which will be serialized on this page starting today.

　　上饶集中营
    邵宇
    一九四一年，蒋介石匪军二十余万人对坚持大江南北敌后战场、艰苦奋斗的新四军皖南部队万余人进行背义的袭击，造成震惊中外的皖南事变，许多被捕的新四军将士们就被囚禁在上饶集中营。邵宇同志即是当时被囚禁的爱国分子之一，他用熟练的画笔，带着强烈的憎和爱，描出当日目睹的事实，构成《上饶集中营》画集。国民党特务匪帮的滔天罪行，革命战士宁死不屈的英勇事迹，都作了有力的表现。本集共二十三幅，本日起在本版连载。
