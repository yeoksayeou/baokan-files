　　A Mongolian's View of a Mongolian Film
    ——"Springtime in Inner Mongolia"
    I am a Mongolian, living in the Mongolian region.
    Speaking of the Mongolian region, there is an ancient poem that goes like this: "The land of the Chiler, beneath the Yin Mountains, the sky is like a yurt, covering the four fields. The sky is vast, the wilderness boundless, the wind blows the grass low to reveal cattle and sheep." Many people also think of the Mongolian region this way: endless green grasslands, silver yurts dotted across the prairie, azure lakes reflecting golden deserts, countless herds of cattle and sheep hidden in the tall grass. The Mongolian region is truly full of poetic charm! The people who live here sometimes gather to wrestle, shoot arrows, race horses, drink wine, dance, and sing; sometimes they disperse into small groups, even families, moving to places they desire. The Mongolian region is so free! In fact, this is only looking at the surface of the Mongolian region.
    During the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialist rule of Inner Mongolia, some writers wrote many Mongolian legends, plays, poems, reportage, paintings, and so on. However, of all these works, I have rarely seen any that truly wrote about the Mongolian people, that wrote about the real situation in Mongolia.
    "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" is the first film that truthfully and artistically reflects the life and struggles of the Inner Mongolian people.
    In August 1945, the Soviet-Mongolian Red Army marched into Northeast China, and the Japanese imperialists soon collapsed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Inner Mongolian people launched a wave of struggles for emancipation, shaking the foundation of the feudal rule of the princes and nobles of Inner Mongolia. In order to unify the leadership of the Inner Mongolian people's liberation struggle, a conference of representatives of the leagues and banners was held in Zhangjiakou at the end of 1945, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation, headed by Chairman Ulanhu, was established. After the establishment of the Autonomous Movement Federation, a large number of cadres were sent to do mass work, actively publicizing the program of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation in various leagues and banners, and organizing the league and banner branches of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation. "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" depicts the work situation of a relatively typical banner at that time, how it united and won over the masses, how it isolated the enemy, and how it united the Mongolian and Han people to defeat the invasion of the Kuomintang bandit army.
    "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" forcefully criticizes the narrow nationalism that exists among the Mongolian people, and clearly opposes the Han chauvinism of the Kuomintang, correctly analyzing the historical origins of narrow nationalism and great Han chauvinism from the internationalist viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism. It clearly tells us that the mutual massacres and wars between the Mongolian and Han nationalities in history were all caused by the reactionary ruling classes of Mongolia and Han China; there is no hatred between the Mongolian and Han working people.
    After "August 15th," the feudal rulers of Inner Mongolia, in order to maintain their rule, continued to ride on the necks of the Mongolian people and commit evil deeds, using all kinds of deception on the people. They outwardly advocated that Inner Mongolia should be "independent" and opposed Han interference in Inner Mongolia, but in reality, they colluded with the Kuomintang Han chauvinists, openly or secretly, to suppress the people's struggle for emancipation. At that time, some Mongolian masses listened to the lies of the feudal rulers, thinking that the Kuomintang was bad, but the Communist Party was not good either, and that Mongolians who joined the Communist Party were surrendering to the Han people; later, after many iron facts - the Communist Party helped the Mongolians, and the Kuomintang massacred the Mongolians - proved this, these people realized that they had been deceived by the feudal rulers and recognized that the Communist Party was the true savior of all nationalities, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were the common enemy of the Mongolian and Han people. "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" depicts this process of awakening of the Mongolian people.
    "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" reveals the situation of class struggle in Inner Mongolia, which is very important. In the past, the feudal rulers of Inner Mongolia denied the existence of classes in Inner Mongolia, and some people outside who did not understand Inner Mongolian society thought that the grassland was a land of freedom. On the contrary, Inner Mongolia had a very dark and cruel feudal rule. The princes had the power to decide the life and death of the people, and the herdsmen did not even have the freedom to marry; the princes lived a life of extravagance and licentiousness, while the lives of the people were worse than cattle and horses.
    "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" was written after deeply experiencing the life habits, thoughts and feelings of the Inner Mongolian people, and it was also filmed in constant modification and enrichment. Therefore, it has a strong Mongolian national color and Mongolian national flavor. It abandons all unnecessary trivial matters, grasps the most important and typical events, and truthfully portrays the historical facts of the Inner Mongolian people's liberation struggle with several typical characters. Because of this, this film deeply moved me. I seemed to see real people and real things, attracting me to follow the story of the film with anger and joy.
    Some of the roles in "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" are played by Mongolian comrades. It is the first time in the history of Inner Mongolia that Mongolians have participated in film work. In the past, under the rule of the Manchus, the Kuomintang, and the Japanese imperialists, cattle and sheep were taken away, pastures were seized, culture was destroyed, and the Mongolian people lived a life of suffering and ignorance. After "August 15th," the Inner Mongolian people, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, were emancipated, and not only achieved liberation and development in politics and economy, but also achieved liberation and development in culture. The Inner Mongolian people now have their own schools, their own newspapers, and their own literary and artistic workers, participating in modern and scientific film art work, which is really gratifying. This also shows that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can all ethnic minorities have such a life.
    In short, "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" is the first artistic film that truly depicts the life and struggle of the Inner Mongolian people. It explains who are the friends of the Inner Mongolian people, who are the enemies of the Inner Mongolian people, and makes a correct explanation of the Mongolian-Han national question, nationalism, and internationalism. I think this film will have considerable educational significance for the people of all nationalities.
    Of course, the film "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" still has some shortcomings. First of all, the struggle between the two roads in Inner Mongolia (one is the road of the upper-level feudal rulers betraying the Mongolian nation, and the other is the revolutionary road of the people rising up to seize power) is not written deeply enough. For example, the struggle of Suhe (a Communist Party member) to win over the prince is not shown enough, and the prince's (feudal ruler's) superficial and secretly insidious methods are not written enough, so people feel that the work in Inner Mongolia seems to be relatively easy, which is different from the actual situation. Real life is indeed richer and more complex than art.
    Secondly, Dondebu (the representative figure of narrow nationalist thinking in the film) is written too isolated. The author is not bold enough to deal with such problems, as if fearing that writing too heavily would hinder the correctness of its theme. In actual life, the reason why the problem of Mongolian-Han unity has been basically solved today is because there are basically no contradictions between the Mongolian and Han working people, and the reason why there are gaps is caused by the reactionary Chinese ruling class. As early as the Chinese Revolution (1925-1927), the advanced elements of the Mongolian revolution accepted and tempered the idea of internationalism in continuous struggle and testing, and influenced and educated the advanced Mongolian youth and the broad masses. After "August 15th," as the Chinese revolution embarked on a new climax, the influence of the Party in the Inner Mongolian region was more widely disseminated and deepened, and the Chinese Communist Party's internationalist ethnic policy was more specifically embodied as iron facts. After several years of arduous work, facts more powerfully than rhetoric explained the misunderstanding between the Han and Mongolian people, and realized the unprecedented close unity between the Mongolian and Han nationalities in nearly hundreds of years. Therefore, the script portrays Dondebu as an individual isolated person, and there is a lack of organic relationship in the image between him and the people around him. At the same time, the intensity of the Party's positive influence on Dondebu is insufficient.
    Although there are the above shortcomings, this film is basically successful. In today's young people's film industry in China, this film should have its unique position. As a Mongolian, I feel very honored and happy, and I hope that more films depicting ethnic minorities will appear in the near future. I also believe that soon, what I hope will become a reality.

　　一个蒙古人看一部蒙古片
    ——《内蒙春光》
    我是一个蒙古人，住在蒙古地方。
    提起蒙古地方来，古时候有一首诗是这样写的：“敕勒川，阴山下，天似穹庐，笼盖四野。天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊。”有好多人也会这样想蒙古地方：绿色的草地一望无际，银色的蒙古包点缀在草原上，蔚蓝色的湖水映着金色的沙漠，无数的牛羊群隐匿在丛草中间。蒙古地方真是多么富于诗意啊！在这里住的人们有时聚在一起摔跤、射箭、赛马、吃酒、跳舞、唱歌；有时他们分散成一小伙一小伙，甚至一家一家搬到愿意去的地方，蒙古地方是多么自由啊！其实，这只是从表面上看蒙古地方。
    在国民党及日本帝国主义统治内蒙时期，有些文人们就写了不少蒙古的传奇、剧本、诗、报告文学、绘画等。然而所有这些作品，真正写蒙古人民的，写出蒙古真实情况的，我却很少见到。
    《内蒙春光》是第一部真实的艺术的反映了内蒙人民生活与斗争的电影。
    在一九四五年八月间苏蒙红军进兵东北，日本帝国主义者随即倒台。内蒙人民在中国共产党的领导下掀起了翻身斗争的浪潮、动摇了内蒙王公、贵族封建统治的基础。为了统一领导内蒙人民的解放斗争，于一九四五年末在张家口召开了盟旗人民代表会议，成立了以乌兰夫主席为首的内蒙古自治运动联合会。自治运动联合会成立以后派大批干部去做群众工作，在各盟旗积极宣传内蒙自治运动联合会纲领，组织内蒙自治运动联合会的盟旗分会。“内蒙春光”就是描写了当时比较典型的一个旗的工作情形，怎样团结争取了群众，怎样孤立了敌人，怎样团结蒙汉人民打垮了国民党匪军的进犯。
    《内蒙春光》有力的批判了蒙古民族中所存在的狭隘民族主义，并明确的反对了国民党大汉族主义者，正确的以马列主义的国际主义观点分析了狭隘民族主义，大民族主义的历史来源。它明确的告诉我们：历史上蒙汉民族相互屠杀，战争，都是由蒙汉反动统治阶级所造成的；蒙汉劳动人民之间是没有仇恨的。
    “八一五”以后，内蒙封建统治者们为了维持自己的统治，继续骑在蒙古人民的脖子上为非作恶，对人民大施其欺骗的技俩。他们表面上主张内蒙要“独立”，反对汉人来干涉内蒙，实际上或明或暗地与国民党大汉族主义者勾结在一起，镇压人民的翻身斗争。当时一部分蒙古群众听信了封建统治者的谎话，认为国民党坏，共产党也不好，蒙古人加入了共产党就是投降了汉人；以后经过好多铁的事实——共产党帮助蒙古人，国民党屠杀蒙古人——的证明，这些人才发现自己受了封建统治者的欺骗，认识了共产党是各民族人民真正的救星，国民党反动派是蒙汉人民共同的敌人。《内蒙春光》就描写了蒙古人民的这种觉悟的过程。
    《内蒙春光》揭露了内蒙古社会阶级斗争的情形，这是很重要的。过去内蒙的封建统治者否认内蒙有阶级存在，外面也有些不了解内蒙社会的人以为草原上是自由天地。相反的内蒙有着非常黑暗、残暴的封建统治，王爷对人民有生杀予夺之权，牧民连结婚的自由都没有；王爷过着骄奢淫佚的生活，人民的生活却不如牛马、骆驼。
    《内蒙春光》是深刻的体验了内蒙人民生活习惯、思想情感后写成的，同时又是在不断的修改、充实中摄制成的。因此，它有浓厚的蒙古民族彩色，蒙古民族风味。它抛弃一切不必要的琐碎的事情，抓着最主要的、典型的事件，用几个典型的人物真实的刻画出内蒙人民解放斗争的史实。正因为如此，所以这部片子深深地感动了我，我好像看到了真的人，真的事情，吸引着我跟着片子的故事而愤恨，而欢欣。
    《内蒙春光》中的角色，有一部分是由蒙古同志所饰。蒙古人来参加电影工作，是内蒙有史以来第一次。过去内蒙人民在满清、国民党、日本帝国主义统治下，牛羊被人拉走，牧场被人抢占，文化被人摧残，蒙古人民过着苦痛愚昧的生活。“八一五”以后，内蒙人民在中国共产党领导与帮助下得到翻身，不但在政治上、经济上求得解放与发展，而且在文化上也求得了解放与发展。内蒙古人民现在有了自己的学校，自己的报社，并且有了自己的文艺工作者，参加了现代的、科学的电影艺术工作，实在是可喜的事情。这也说明了只有在共产党领导下各少数民族才有这样生活的可能。
    总之，《内蒙春光》是真正描写内蒙人民生活与斗争的第一部艺术片，它说明了谁是内蒙人民的朋友，谁是内蒙人民的敌人，并对蒙汉民族问题、民族主义与国际主义问题，作了正确的解释。我想这部片子对各民族的人民都会有相当大的教育意义。
    当然，《内蒙春光》这部影片还是有一些缺点的。首先，对内蒙两条道路（一条是上层封建统治者出卖蒙古民族的道路，一条是人民大众起来掌握政权的革命的道路）的斗争写的尚不够深刻，如苏合（共产党员）对王爷的争取、斗争表现的尚少，王爷（封建统治者）对苏合表面上一套，暗地又一套的阴险手段也写的不多，因此使人觉得内蒙工作好像比较容易，这与实际情形就有了出入。现实生活比之艺术的确丰富而复杂的多。
    其次，对顿得布（片中狭隘民族主义思想的代表人物）写的太孤立了。作者不够大胆的去处理这样的问题，似乎惟恐写的过重就妨碍其主题的正确性。而在实际生活中今天所以基本上解决了蒙汉团结问题，是由于蒙汉劳动人民之间基本上并不存在着矛盾，其所以有着隔阂是由于反动的中国统治阶级所造成的，而远在中国大革命（一九二五至一九二七）的时候，蒙古革命的先进分子就在不断的斗争与考验中接受并锻炼了国际主义的思想，经过他们影响并教育了蒙古先进青年及广大群众。而在“八一五”以后，随着中国革命走上了新的高潮，在内蒙地区党的影响也就得到更广泛的传布与深入，中国共产党国际主义的民族政策更具体的体现成为铁的事实。从经过好几年来的坚苦工作，事实比雄辩更有力的解释了汉蒙人民之间的误解，实现了近几百年来蒙汉民族空前未有的亲密的团结。因之，剧本把顿得布处理成为个别的孤立的人与其周围的人们之间缺乏在型像上的有机关系，同时，表现党对顿得布正面的影响的强度也就不足。
    虽然有以上缺点，但这部片子基本上是成功的，在今天中国年轻的人民电影事业中，这部片子应有它独特的地位。我以一个蒙古人来说，觉得非常光荣与高兴，并愿不久的将来出现更多描写少数民族的影片。我也相信：不久，我所希望的就会成为事实。
