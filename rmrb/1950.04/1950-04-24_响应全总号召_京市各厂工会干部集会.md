Responding to the Call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Cadres of Factory Trade Unions in Beijing Gather

    [Our Newspaper] In response to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to provide relief to unemployed workers, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially invited Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to give a report at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall at 9:00 AM yesterday. More than 5,000 cadres above the level of union group leader from various public and private factories, organs, and cultural and educational unions attended.

    Li Lisan first expressed his respect for the enthusiastic and spontaneous donations and labor contributions of Beijing workers to aid unemployed workers. He then explained that the closure of certain industrial and commercial enterprises after liberation, as well as the current commercial recession caused by stable prices, is an inevitable phenomenon in China's transition from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy to a new democratic economy. The difficulties arising from this are difficulties in the course of victory, difficulties in the course of development, and these difficulties can certainly be overcome. Comrade Li Lisan said: Prices have been fluctuating for twelve years, and now that they have stabilized, market stagnation will naturally occur, but this stagnation is not long-term. In three to five months, business will improve. After the autumn harvest, the purchasing power of farmers will increase, and sales of goods will be even better. After the liberation of Taiwan and the complete annihilation of the remaining bandits, and after the land reform in the countryside, the national financial situation can be fundamentally improved.

    Finally, Li Lisan called on everyone to work together to provide relief to unemployed workers and overcome the current temporary difficulties. Li Lisan said: As long as we all work together, this difficulty can be overcome. We can tell the unemployed workers in Shanghai: "You will not go hungry, our workers and farmers will rise up to help you, the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army will help you, and the workers of the whole country will unite to overcome difficulties and build a prosperous and strong new China!"

　　响应全总号召
    京市各厂工会干部集会
    【本报讯】为响应全国总工会号召，救济失业工人，昨日上午九时，北京市总工会文教部特邀请全国总工会副主席李立三在中山公园音乐堂作报告，有各公私营工厂工会、各机关和文教工会小组长以上干部五千余人参加。
    李立三首先对北京工人为救济失业工人自动热烈的捐款献工表示敬意。继说明解放后，某些工商业的倒闭以及目前因物价平稳引起的商业萧条，是中国由半封建半殖民地经济过渡到新民主主义经济不可避免的必然现象。由此产生的困难，是胜利前进中的困难，发展中的困难，这种困难一定能够克服的。李立三同志说：十二年来物价一直在波动，现在平稳下来，市场停滞现象自然会发生的，但这种停滞不是长期的，三五个月后，营业就会好转，秋收后，农民购买力增加，商品销路就会更好；待台湾解放，彻底歼灭残匪，农村经过土改后，全国财经情况就能根本好转。
    最后，李立三号召大家一致努力，救济失业工人，克服目前暂存的困难。李立三说：只要我们大家一致努力，这个困难是可以克服的。我们可以告诉上海失业工人：“你们是不会饿肚子的，我们工人农民都会起来帮助你们的，人民政府和人民解放军都会帮助你们的，全国工人一致团结起来，一定可以克服困难，一定可以建设一个繁荣富强的新中国”。
