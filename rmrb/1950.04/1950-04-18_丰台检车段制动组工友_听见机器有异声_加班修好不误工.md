Since the Fengtai Vehicle Inspection Section has rigorously implemented the responsibility system for tools and machinery, the brake team has become a model for implementing the responsibility system. On the morning of March 7th, workers Yao Rongting and Wang Jinming of the team were working when they suddenly heard an abnormal noise from the air pump machine. They immediately turned off the power and carried out a detailed inspection and repair work. In order not to delay production, they sacrificed their lunch and rest time, replacing two small wear rings and one large wear ring. By 3:00 PM, the air pump machine was repaired, ensuring that the entire work plan was not affected. At the same time, the team workers wait for other teams to finish their work every day to conduct air testing, and their selfless spirit has been unanimously admired by all workers in the section.

　　丰台检车段制动组工友
    听见机器有异声  加班修好不误工
    【本报讯】丰台检车段自从厉行工具、机器负责制以来，制动组成为执行负责制的模范。三月七日上午该组工友么荣廷、王金明正工作时，突然听见风泵机有异声，立即关闭电门进行细密检查和整修工作。他俩为不耽误生产使用，牺牲了中午吃饭及休息时间，更换了两片小型磨耗圈，一片大型磨耗圈。到下午三点钟风泵机修好，使整个工作计划未受影响。同时，该组工友每天等其他组工作完毕，实行试风，为公忘私的精神，受到了全段工友的一致钦佩。
