　　Soviet Children's Bookstore

    "Love books, for they are the source of knowledge. Only knowledge is beneficial, and only knowledge can make us spiritually strong, upright, and rational people, people who can sincerely love others, respect human labor, and wholeheartedly admire the constant, great, and beautiful fruits of labor." - M. Gorky

    In addition to parents, teachers, knowledgeable elders, and librarians, Soviet children have a capable guide in choosing good books—treasures of knowledge. On March 28th, we had the opportunity to visit it.

    Soviet children enter school at the age of seven. With so many children receiving education, the scale of children's book supply is considerable. In 1949 alone, more than six million copies of children's books were published; it is common for a popular children's book to be issued 200,000 to 400,000 copies. Publishing a lot is not everything. The State Children's Book Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic plans to publish five million copies this year to satisfy children's broad thirst for knowledge. To have both quantity and quality is not easy.

    The Children's Bookstore is directly under the State Children's Book Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Its specific target audience is: preschool children (six years old), and children in grades one to seven (seven to fourteen years old). On the one hand, it assists the publishing bureau and writers in publishing good children's books based on the scientific foundation of children's education; on the other hand, it inspires children's interest in reading, introduces good books to children, and guides children to acquire knowledge.

    The Children's Bookstore has four sections: (1) Children's Literature Criticism, Theory, and History Section; (2) Children's Readers' Interests and Requirements Research Section; (3) Book Printing and Art Section; (4) Children's Books Promotion Section. The Children's Bookstore also has a library, a children's reading room, and a children's bookstore exhibition hall. The library specializes in serving editors, writers, educators, librarians, and scientific researchers who study children's books and reading materials. The children's reading room has two rooms, one for younger children and one for older children, open from 12:00 noon to 6:00 pm every day. The Children's Bookstore Exhibition Hall categorizes and displays children's favorite works from the Soviet Patriotic War, works that have won Stalin Prizes, folk literature works of various Soviet nationalities, classical literature works, historical and geographical knowledge, scientific knowledge works... The Children's Bookstore will soon open a children's bookstore in a corner of its location (43 Gorky Street, Moscow).

    The Children's Bookstore regularly conducts surveys of children readers. It communicates with children, collects, organizes, and studies their letters. The last page of children's books always has these sentences: "Readers: The publishing department asks you to send your opinions on this book...." The Children's Bookstore receives an average of 160 to 180 letters of opinion every day. Last year, the Children's Bookstore issued questionnaires to children throughout the Soviet Union. The form asked two questions: What books have you read this year? Which ones do you like the most? (Limited to three books). Children as far away as Sakhalin Island wrote letters. Many children underlined the three favorite books twice and underlined a long list of other books once, indicating that these were the more liked ones.

    According to the person in charge of the Children's Bookstore, Soviet children have a very wide range of interests. She read to us the gathered children's opinions: children requested more books like "The Story of a Real Man" (this is Polevoi's 1947 work, which won the Stalin Prize, and tells the true story of the Soviet hero Maresyev, who, after losing both legs in an air battle with the German invaders, persevered in overcoming his disability and continued to serve in the air force); they requested more stories about the future of Soviet children, the character of Soviet students, love and friendship, as well as historical stories, travelogues, biographies of great people... She said: Generally speaking, Soviet children especially like hero biographies, travelogues, and stories about children. Soviet children are interested not only in their own country's past, present, and future, but also in foreign countries. They repeatedly requested more books about the political systems of various countries. They warmly requested introductions to the situation of Chinese children, stories of Chinese children participating in the struggle against the Kuomintang army, and even the natural environment of China. The Soviet children's written opinions about Chinese children were quickly confirmed in the children's reading room. There, a girl of about ten years old asked us, "Are Chinese children well? Can they all read books?" We told her that after liberation, the lives of Chinese children had improved, and more children were going to school, but not every child could read books yet. She said, "That doesn't matter. It was the same for us just after the October Revolution."

    The opinions of children are valued by the publishing bureau and writers. The publishing plan is based on the instructions of the Ministry of Education and the requests of children. The Children's Bookstore prepares a file folder for each book, specifically to collect children's readers' opinions on the book. The author of the book often comes to read the children's sensitive and specific opinions. The Children's Bookstore regularly organizes lectures, review meetings, and meetings between readers and writers or educators on issues related to children's reading materials. On these occasions, writers often read drafts of their works to the children, listen to their opinions, and revise or even completely rewrite them. Concern for children's interests can also be seen in the illustrations. Soviet children's books are printed more exquisitely than general books and often have illustrations, especially children's books for young children. According to comrades working at the Children's Bookstore: Soviet children like realistic, concrete, brightly colored, and clearly lined pictures. When we look at the illustrations in Soviet children's books, they do have these characteristics.

    Another daily task of the Children's Bookstore is to introduce books. Last year, it published the booklet "What Children Read," which introduces extracurricular reading materials to children in grades one to seven. The extracurricular reading materials for the fifth grade include Katayev's "Son of the Regiment," Furmanov's "Chapayev," and other novels, poems, travelogues, and biographies, totaling forty-six kinds. The extracurricular reading materials for the sixth grade include Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered," Polevoi's "We Are Soviet People" (heroic stories from the Soviet Patriotic War), and other forty kinds. The extracurricular reading materials for the seventh grade include Fadeyev's "The Young Guard," Simonov's "Days and Nights," A. Tolstoy's "Russian Character," and Popovsky's "Academician Lysenko" (biography), totaling fifty-eight kinds. The "New Children's Books" published by the Children's Bookstore this year lists 144 kinds of stories, poems, novels, and plays published last year and this year, including Mikhalkov's "I Want to Go Home" (play, three acts and nine scenes, describing the story of Soviet children who were driven to Germany by the German invaders during the Soviet Patriotic War and were stranded in the British-occupied zone of Germany, which won the Stalin Prize. The film "They Have a Homeland" is adapted from this play), and other books most popular with children.

    The Children's Bookstore also participates in the "Children's Book Week." The first "Children's Book Week" was held in Moscow and Leningrad in 1944, initiated by the Children's Publishing Bureau and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. Since then, it has been held once a year, and the number of participating places has gradually increased. Last year and this year's "Children's Book Week" were held at the end of March during the school spring break. During "Children's Book Week," schools, libraries, Young Pioneer organizations, clubs, children's palaces, and theaters extensively organize children's book exhibitions, talks and reviews about books, reader meetings, reading morning gatherings and evening gatherings, and children's gatherings with writers. On March 29th, such a morning gathering was held in the Moscow Trade Union Building, jointly organized by the Moscow City Federation of Trade Unions and the Children's Bookstore. On that day, the grand conference hall of the Trade Union Building was filled with lively Soviet children, most of whom were wearing Young Pioneer red scarves, without any noise. The meeting staged the story of Lenin being expelled from school when he was young for resolutely helping a young man from the Chuvash minority to study, staged a scene where the girl in "I Want to Go Home" meets her father, and sang the song "Salute to China"... The most popular thing among the children was the speeches of the writers. Mikhalkov, the writer of "I Want to Go Home," read his new poem "Dollar and Ruble," which mainly said: The dollar and the ruble met, the dollar boasted that its footprints were all over the world, and the ruble revealed that the dollar brought poverty, hunger, and unemployment to the people. Kassil, the writer of "The Street of the Younger Son," told the children present that readers like good writers, and writers also like good readers. A good reader reads carefully and gives opinions to the writer after reading. He said: After the publication of "The Street of the Younger Son" (which tells the story of a fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer, Valoga, helping the guerrillas in 1941), he received a letter from the captain of this guerrilla team, providing a lot of useful materials. He hoped that readers and writers would maintain close contact and give writers more opinions.

    From the Children's Bookstore and its activities, we saw the Soviet people's concern for the younger generation and the close relationship between Soviet publishers, writers, and readers.

### 苏联儿童书屋

　　苏联儿童书屋
    新华社及本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    “要爱好书，这是知识的源泉，只有知识是有益的，只有知识可以使我们成为精神上坚强的、正直的、有理性的人，这种人能够真诚地爱人，尊重人的劳动，衷心地赞赏人的不断的、伟大的、美丽的劳动果实”。——Ｍ·高尔基
    苏联儿童要选择好的书—知识的宝藏，除了父母、教师、有学问的长辈和图书馆员之外，还有一个得力的向导。它就是儿童书屋。三月二十八日，我们得了一个机会访问了它。
    苏联儿童满七岁就进学校。受教育的儿童既然多，儿童书籍供应的规模也就可观。拿一九四九年来说，就出版了六百万册以上的儿童书籍；受儿童欢迎的书，一种发行二十万册到四十万册是常事。出书多，这还不是一切。俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国教育部的国家儿童书籍出版局，计划今年要出书五百万册，要满足儿童的广泛的求知欲。要多又要精，这就不容易了。
    儿童书屋是直属于俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国教育部的国家儿童书籍出版局的。它具体服务的对象是：学龄前的儿童（六岁），一年级到七年级的儿童（七岁到十四岁）。它一方面协助出版局和作家根据儿童教育的科学基础，出版美好的儿童书籍；另一方面启发儿童读书兴趣，介绍好书给儿童，指引儿童取得知识。
    儿童书屋设有四个室：（一）儿童读物的批评、理论和历史室；（二）儿童读者的兴趣和要求研究室；（三）书籍印刷美术室；（四）儿童书籍宣传室。儿童书屋还附设有图书馆、儿童读书厅、儿童书屋陈列室。图书馆专门为研究儿童书籍和读物的编辑、作家、教育家、图书馆员、科学工作者服务。儿童读书厅有两间，一间设给小儿童，一间设给大儿童，每天从中午十二时到下午六时开放。儿童书屋陈列室分类排列着儿童爱读的苏联卫国战争中的作品，获得斯大林奖金的作品，苏各民族民间文学作品，古典文学作品，史地知识、科学知识作品……。儿童书屋不久将在它的所在地（莫斯科高尔基街四十三号）的一角开设一家儿童书店。
    儿童书屋经常向儿童读者进行调查。它和儿童们通讯，收集、整理和研究他们的书信。儿童书籍的最后一叶，总写有这样几句话：“读者们：出版部请你们把对这本书的意见寄来……。”儿童书屋平均每天收到一百六十封到一百八十封的意见书。儿童书屋于去年曾向全苏儿童发出调查表。表上提出两个问题：今年你看了什么书？最喜欢的是那几本？（以三本为限）远从库页岛的儿童都写信来了。许多儿童在最喜欢的三本书下面划了两道，在三本以外的一大串书名下划了一道，表示这些是较喜欢的。
    据儿童书屋负责人谈：苏联儿童的兴趣非常之广。她把汇集起来的儿童意见念给我们听：儿童要求多写像《真正的人的故事》的书（这是波列沃依一九四七年作品，获得斯大林奖金，写苏联英雄马列世娃在同德寇空战中失掉两腿以后，坚忍地克服残疾，继续在空军服务的真实故事）；要求多写苏联儿童的前途，苏联学生的品格，爱情与友谊，以及历史故事，游记、伟人传……她说：一般说来，苏联儿童特别喜欢英雄传记、游记和关于儿童的故事。苏联儿童不但对本国过去的、现在的、未来的，而且对外国的，都有兴趣。他们一再要求多写关于各国政治制度的书。他们热烈地要求介绍中国儿童情形，中国儿童参加跟国民党军队斗争的故事，以至于中国的自然环境。苏联儿童关心中国儿童的书面意见，很快的在儿童读书厅得到了证实。在那里，一个十岁左右的女孩子问我们说：“中国儿童好吗？都能够读到书吗？”我们告诉她，解放后中国儿童生活改善了，读书的也多起来，但还没有做到每个儿童都能读到书。她说：“那不要紧。十月革命刚胜利时，我们也是这样的呢。”
    儿童的意见，受到出版局和作家的重视。出版计划就是根据教育部的指示和儿童的要求拟订的。儿童书屋替每一本书准备一个公文袋，专门集纳儿童读者对这本书的意见。这本书的作者经常来阅读儿童们敏感而具体的意见。儿童书屋经常组织有关儿童读物问题的演讲会、评论会、读者和作家或教育家的会面。在这些场合，作家常常把自己作品的草稿，朗诵给儿童们听，听取他们的意见，加以修正甚至于完全改写。对儿童兴趣的关怀，还可以从插图看到。苏联儿童读物，比一般书籍印刷得精致，常常有插图，特别是幼年儿童读物。据儿童书屋工作同志说：苏联儿童喜欢构图现实、具体，颜色鲜明，线条清楚的图画。我们看苏联儿童书籍的插图，确有这样的特色。
    儿童书屋另一个日常工作是介绍书籍。它去年出版了《儿童读什么》的小册子，向一年级到七年级的儿童介绍课外读物。五年级的课外读物有卡达耶夫的《团的儿子》、富尔曼诺夫的《卡帕耶夫》等小说、诗歌、游记、传记等四十六种。六年级的课外读物有奥斯特罗夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，波列沃依的“我们是苏维埃的人”（苏联卫国战争中的英雄故事）等四十种。七年级的课外读物有法捷耶夫的“青年近卫军”，西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”，Ａ·托尔斯泰的“俄罗斯性格”，波波夫斯基的“李森科院士”（传记）等五十八种。儿童书屋今年刊行的“儿童新书”，列举了去年和今年出版的故事、诗歌、小说、剧本一百四十四种，包括米哈尔科夫作的《我要回家去》（剧本，三幕九场，描写在苏联卫国战争中被德寇赶到德国去的苏联儿童，被留难在德境英占区的故事，获得斯大林奖金。电影“他们有祖国”就是根据这剧本改编的。）等等最受儿童欢迎的书籍。
    儿童书屋还参预“儿童书籍周”的举办。“儿童书籍周”第一次于一九四四年在莫斯科和列宁格勒举行，是由儿童出版局和全苏职工会中央理事会发起的。此后每年举行一次，参加的地方逐渐增多。去年和今年的“儿童书籍周”，都是在三月底学校放春假时节举行的。在“儿童书籍周”中，学校、图书馆、儿童团组织、俱乐部、儿童宫、戏院，都广泛组织儿童书籍展览，关于书籍的谈话会和评论会，读者会，读物朝会和晚会，儿童与作家联欢会。三月二十九日，莫斯科职工会大厦举行了这样的一个朝会，是由莫斯科市职工会理事会和儿童书屋共同组织的。当天，宏大的职工会大厦会议厅坐满了活泼的苏联儿童，他们多半都结着儿童团的红领带，没有一点吵闹声。会上演了列宁小时因为坚决帮助一个楚瓦什小数民族的青年学习而被学校开除的故事，演了“我要回家去”的女孩子会见父亲的一节，唱了“向中国致敬”的歌……最受儿童欢迎的，是作家的说话。“我要回家去”的作家米哈尔科夫念了自己的新作“美元和卢布”一诗，大意说：美元和卢布见了面，美元夸口自己足迹遍天下，卢布揭发美元把贫穷、饥饿和失业带给人民。“小儿子的街”的作家卡西里告诉到会的儿童说：读者喜欢好的作家，作家也喜欢好的读者。好的读者读书仔细，读后会向作家提意见。他说：“小儿子的街”（写一个十四岁的儿童团员瓦洛加在一九四一年帮助游击队的故事）出版后，得到这一游击队队长的信，提供了很多有益的材料。他希望读者和作家保持密切的联系，多多向作家提意见。
    我们从儿童书屋及其活动上，看到了苏联人对幼年一代的关怀，看到了苏联出版家、作家、读者之间关系的密切。
              一九五○年三月三十一日
