　　Taiyuan Railway Bureau Inspects Sanitation Work on All Lines

    [This newspaper report] In response to the Ministry of Railways' call to launch a spring environmental cleaning and sanitation campaign, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Committee mobilized its employees and their families from March 13th to actively improve environmental sanitation. This work has been underway for more than two weeks. In order to deeply understand the situation on the ground, evaluate the performance of each unit, and summarize experience, the committee, together with the trade union, formed two inspection teams. They departed on March 30th to inspect the environmental sanitation along the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang-Dezhou, and Tongpu Railways. The inspection focused on the environmental sanitation of offices, dormitories, kitchens, toilets, waiting rooms, trains, and other places directly related to the health of employees and passengers. The inspection procedure was to first go to each office, factory, and section to understand the overall situation; then meticulously inspect and guide each station, and transform this campaign into regular work. After the inspection, rewards and punishments will be given according to the merits of performance. (Zhang Jingguang)
