　　Shanghai Public Enterprises Begin Inventory of Warehouse Materials
    China Textile Mill No. 10 Discovers Over 1.8 Million Pieces of Equipment
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th] Shanghai has fully launched an inventory of warehouse materials. This work began in late March, initially at enterprises such as the China Textile Construction Company of Shanghai, Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, Shanghai Rolling Stock Plant, Shanghai Railway Bureau, and the Postal Bureau. The fifteen warehouses of various industries under the East China Heavy Industry Department have also formed inventory teams. The warehouse materials inventory work of all public enterprises in the city will also be fully launched soon. The Shanghai China Textile Company, which started work earlier, has cleared out a large number of materials in factories No. 9 and No. 10. In the six warehouses of Factory No. 10 alone, over 1,828,000 pieces of various equipment were found, many of which are currently needed by various factories of the China Textile Company and are not easily purchased on the market. The material section of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot cleared out more than 200 types of materials that were unaccounted for or did not match the records. In addition, a considerable amount of materials was also cleared out at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory and the Rolling Stock Plant. The Shanghai materials inventory work is currently continuing.
