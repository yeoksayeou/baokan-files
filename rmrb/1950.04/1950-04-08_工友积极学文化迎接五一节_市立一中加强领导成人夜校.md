　　Workers Actively Study Culture to Welcome May Day; Municipal No. 1 Middle School Strengthens Leadership of Adult Night School

　　The Workers' Night School in the Ninth District of Beijing has more than 130 male and female students, all with extremely high enthusiasm for learning. Students from the opera troupe of the Middle School affiliated with Beijing Normal University often go to help organize recreational activities. Currently, the workers are divided into groups to carry out recreational work in preparation for the upcoming May 1st Labor Day. The singing group is rehearsing new songs such as "May 1st Labor Day." The drama group has begun rehearsing a four-scene mini-Yangko opera "Study Well" and the drama "Strive for Production, Labor-Capital Both Benefit," preparing to broadcast them on the People's Radio Station soon.

　　The Guang'an Branch of the Beijing Vegetable Industry Union's spare-time cultural school opened on the 19th and officially started classes on the 20th. There are more than 100 students, divided into three classes: primary, intermediate, and advanced. Students from the National Hui People's College have been hired as professors. Advanced and primary classes are held on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, while intermediate classes are held on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Each class is two hours long.

　　The Eighth District of Beijing's spare-time school held its opening ceremony on the 25th. There are 440 students, including nine units such as the district office, trade union, sub-bureau, cleaning team, and industrial workers. They are divided into seven primary classes and two junior high classes, with four full-time teachers.

　　The Municipal No. 1 Middle School Trade Union established an adult night school in the early stages of the government's call to promote social education. However, due to a lack of experience and restrictions from various conditions, there were only 20 to 30 students for several months. When the trade union executive committee summarized at the end of last year, it decided that the trade union's social service division would take unified leadership and formulate rules: fourteen or fifteen more teachers were hired (teachers and staff of No. 1 Middle School volunteered), strengthening teaching. In the past two months, the number of students has increased to more than 130, and they have been divided into Class A, Class B, and Class C according to their educational level. Appropriate rewards are given to those with excellent grades.

　　工友积极学文化迎接五一节  市立一中加强领导成人夜校
    京市九区工人夜校现有男女学员一百三十余人，学习情绪都极高。师大男女附中歌剧团同学经常前往帮助组织文娱活动，目前工友们正分组进行文娱工作，准备迎接快要到来的“五一”劳动节。歌咏组正练唱“五一劳动节”等新歌曲。话剧组已开始排演四场小型秧歌剧《学习好》，和话剧《努力生产劳资两利》，准备最近到人民电台广播。

    京市菜业工会广安分会业余文化学校在十九日开学，二十日正式上课。学员共一百余名，分初级、中级、高级三班。已聘请国立回民学院学员教授。高、初级班星期一、三、五、日上课，中级班星期二、四、六日上课。每日学习两点钟。

    故宫博物院工会业余学校成立。该校经过一个多月的筹备，已于三月二十九日下午六时，在该院神武门楼举行开学典礼。到工警学员三百七十余人。按学员文化程度，划分六班，计甲级一班，乙级二班，丙级三班，自三十日起正式上课。

    北京市第八区业余学校于二十五日举行开学典礼。学员四百四十名，计有区公所、工会、分局、清洁队、产业工人等九个单位。分为初级七班、初中二班，专任教员四人。                                （八区委宣传部）
    市立一中工会在政府号召推广社会教育的初期就成立了成人夜校。但由于缺乏经验和被各种条件的限制，几个月来总是只有二、三十个学生。工会执委会去年年底总结时，决定由工会社会服务股统一领导，并制定规则：增聘了十四五位教员（一中教职员义务担任），加强教学。两个月来，学生人数已经增加到一百三十多人，并已按学生文化程度分设甲、乙、丙三班，成绩优良者都给予适当的奖励。
