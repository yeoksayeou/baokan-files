On April 22nd, the newspapers published the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. Although I am not a Communist Party member, I am extremely moved by this serious and conscientious decision of the CCP Central Committee, which has swept away my long-standing ideological concerns about the Communist Party.

The Chinese Communist Party's contribution to leading the Chinese people to liberation is indelible. However, some Chinese people have not been liberated for long, and due to the long-term influence of reactionary propaganda and the rumors spread by lurking Kuomintang secret agents after liberation, they still have some concerns about the Communist Party. They always compare the words and actions of Communists with each other; verify the instructions of the Communist Party's superiors with the work style of their subordinates; and often compare the words and actions of Communists with the words and actions of the past Kuomintang reactionaries. In this way, Communists should especially prevent errors from occurring, especially the bureaucratic work style. Because some people often do not regard the bureaucratic work style of individual Communist Party members as the mistake of individual members, but suspect that the entire Communist Party is "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted, and does not act in accordance with its words." Some people who truly love the Communist Party are afraid of suffering immediate losses if they criticize the shortcomings of Communist Party members, and therefore dare not boldly criticize the mistakes (especially the bureaucratic work style) of Communist Party members they have seen. These situations do exist.

The instructions of the CCP Central Committee state: "...Our Party has already led the national regime, and the shortcomings and errors in our work can easily harm the interests of the broad masses of the people. Due to the position of the leaders of the regime and the increase in the prestige of the leaders, it is easy to generate arrogance and refuse to accept or suppress criticism inside and outside the Party. Due to the emergence of these new situations, if we cannot openly and promptly launch criticism and self-criticism within the entire Party and among the broad masses of the people regarding the shortcomings and errors of our Party's people's government and all economic organs and mass organizations, we will be severely poisoned by bureaucracy and will not be able to complete the task of building a new China..." Every Communist Party member should deeply study and implement this passage in practical actions.

In summary, the CCP Central Committee's instruction and decision is another concrete manifestation of the Chinese Communist Party's wholehearted service to the people. Because only a political party that truly dares to accept criticism, correct mistakes, and stand with the people can run the people's affairs well. The people of China should be glad that the Communist Party, which leads our revolution and nation-building, is so modest, sincere, and selfless. Let us unite closely and move forward together towards the road of happiness!

### 我对中共的顾虑给扫清了

　　我对中共的顾虑给扫清了
    四月二十二日，报纸上公布了中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定。我虽不是共产党员，但对于中共中央这一严肃认真的决定，实在感动万分，使我一向在思想上对共产党所存在的顾虑，一扫而空。
    中国共产党领导中国人民获得解放的功勋，是不可磨灭的。但是有一部分中国人民，获得解放还不久，由于长期受到反动宣传和解放后潜伏的国民党特务分子谣言的影响，对共产党还有些顾虑。他们总是把共产党人的说话与行事，互相来对照；把共产党上级的指示，和下级的作风来印证；更常常把共产党人的说话行事，去和已往的国民党反动派的说话行事来比较。这样，共产党人便应特别防止错误的发生，尤其是官僚主义作风的发生。因为有一部分人往往不把个别共产党员的官僚主义作风当作是个别党员的错误来看待，而是疑心到整个共产党是“口蜜腹剑，言行不一”的。有些真正热爱共产党的人，怕批评了共产党员的缺点会吃眼前亏，因而不敢把他所见到的共产党员的错误（尤其是官僚主义作风）大胆地提出批评。这些情形都是存在的。
    中共中央的指示中说：“……我们的党已经领导着全国的政权，我们工作中的缺点和错误，很容易危害广大人民的利益，而由于政权领导者的地位，领导者威信的提高，就容易产生骄傲情绪，在党内党外拒绝批评，压制批评。由于这些新的情况的产生，如果我们对于我们党的人民政府的及所有经济机关和群众团体的缺点和错误，不能公开地及时地在全党和广大人民中展开批评与自我批评，我们就要被严重的官僚主义所毒害，不能完成新中国的建设任务。……”这一段话，每一个共产党员，是应该深刻学习并且贯彻到实际行动中去的。
    最后总起来说，中共中央的这一指示和决定，是中国共产党真心真意为人民服务的又一具体表现。因为只有真肯接受批评，改正错误，肯和人民站在一起的政党，才会办好人民的事业。全中国的人民，应该庆幸领导我们革命建国的共产党，是这样的虚心诚恳，大公无私。让我们紧紧地团结在一起，共同向幸福的大路迈进吧！
