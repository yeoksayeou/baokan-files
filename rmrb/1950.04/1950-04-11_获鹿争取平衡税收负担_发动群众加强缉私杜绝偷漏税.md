　　Huolu Strives to Balance the Tax Burden
    Mobilizes the Masses to Strengthen Anti-Smuggling and Eliminate Tax Evasion
    [Our Newspaper News] Huolu County achieved considerable success in collecting industrial and commercial taxes last year. The total tax revenue completed throughout the county for the entire year was equivalent to over 1,519,000 jin of millet. However, the entire work still exhibited many weaknesses. In concrete execution, there were tendencies towards being disproportionately light or heavy, resulting in an imbalanced burden and relatively serious tax evasion. The main reasons for these tendencies were a lack of clear and comprehensive planning by the leadership, insufficient preliminary publicity and mobilization of the masses, and the imperfection of lower-level cadres. Furthermore, the selfish views of some tax officials prevented the tax policies from being well implemented and even led to disproportionately light or heavy taxation. For example, in the transaction tax, in the ninth district, there were cases of people transporting a load of crabapples being taxed, while major merchants did not pay enough. Also, the eighth district originally reported 1,500 taxable households, but after review, there were only 800. As the county representative of the district reflected: "Those who should be taxed were not, and those who shouldn't be taxed were." For another example, in the sixth district, a certain Kang, a member of the Industrial and Commercial Committee, only paid 25 jin of millet in taxes for one season for his own oil mill, while other oil mills smaller than his paid more. Tax evasion was also most serious in this district, with the phenomenon of livestock and grain transactions not being taxed being extremely common. In addition, many villages did not pay taxes on cotton transactions. Stamp duty evasion was even more serious. It is estimated that the current amount collected is less than 10% of the amount that should be collected.

    Secondly, the issues of the relocation and transformation of industrial and commercial households in Chengguan were also quite serious. During the evaluation of merchants' tax burden scores last year, the phenomenon of "one trade squeezing another" occurred. When burden evaluations were carried out by trade groups, some merchants formed groups. Whoever had the largest household in the trade was isolated. During the evaluation, they deliberately increased their burden and reduced their own tax amount. Wanquantang, the largest capital Chinese medicine shop, was the first to be squeezed out and reported its closure. The second was Tongrentang. During the evaluation, its score was raised from 400 to more than 700. It was only resolved after educating the merchants. But in reality, it had already caused large merchants to feel fearful. As a result, some merchants implemented transformed operations. Hu Baozhang's general store in Nanguan cancelled its storefront and became a peddler. Feng Yinlai's shelves were empty, and the two brothers rode bicycles to do business. The general reflection was: "We are not afraid of heavy taxes, but we are afraid of an imbalanced burden." There were many like this who changed from seated merchants to stallholders, peddlers, or hawkers. But in reality, the capital had not decreased. Even more, large households moved to Shijiazhuang or the countryside. As of now, among the 768 merchants in Chengguan, 107 have reported closure, which is a great loss to Huolu's tax revenue.

    Based on the above situation, the economic departments of Huolu County held a joint meeting in mid-March to review last year's tax work and determine this year's tax tasks. The meeting believed that eliminating tax evasion and balancing the burden should be the main keys to doing a good job in this year's tax work. Therefore, at the meeting, according to the spirit of the provincial tax meeting and the figures arranged by the higher authorities, combined with the amount of concentration of towns, size, transaction conditions, ability to bear the burden, etc., after careful planning, repeated research, discussion, careful calculation, and relatively balanced distribution, it was decided to vigorously implement policies, adjust lower-level organizations, set up special personnel to be responsible for rural work, mobilize the masses to strengthen anti-smuggling and eliminate tax evasion, mobilize all cadres in the county to check stamps when buying things, do a good job in this year's democratic evaluation of burdens, strengthen the education of merchants, and for merchants who deliberately evade burdens and transform operations, as long as they continue to report business, they will bear the burden according to the original evaluation score. In addition, public enterprises determine the tax amount according to their business situation. The total tax amount of supply and marketing cooperatives, Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company Huolu branch, banks, etc., is 195,750 jin of millet, accounting for 70% of the total tax revenue of all public and private industrial and commercial enterprises in Chengguan. According to the capital, the private sector exceeds the public sector by several times, indicating that this year's task is not heavy. In addition, the calculation is more scientific, and the cadres are extremely confident in completing the task. (Wang Zhen)

### 获鹿争取平衡税收负担  发动群众加强缉私杜绝偷漏税

　　获鹿争取平衡税收负担
    发动群众加强缉私杜绝偷漏税
    【本报讯】获鹿县在去年征收工商业税工作上获有相当成绩，全县全年完成税收总额共折合小米一百五十一万九千余斤。但在整个工作上仍然表现出不少弱点，且在具体执行中发生了畸轻畸重的偏向，造成负担的不平衡与较严重的漏税现象。发生这种偏向的主要原因是由于领导上缺乏明确全面的计划，事先宣传和发动群众的工作做得不够，与下层干部的不健全；且部分税务工作人员的自私观点使税收政策不能很好的贯彻甚至发生了畸轻畸重的现象。如交易税一项，九区发生过担一担沙果的倒纳了税，而主要商户反而纳的不够。又八区原报一千五百户应税户，经审查后仅有八百户，正如该区县代表反映：“该征的没征，不该征的倒征了。”再如六区一康姓工商委员，自己开的油坊一季仅负担二十五斤小米，而别人的油坊比他的小，倒反而负担比他多。漏税现象亦以该区最严重，牲畜与粮食交易不上税的现象极普遍，还有许多村里买卖棉花也不上税。印花漏税更其严重，据估计现征收数尚不到应征额的百分之十。
    其次是城关工商户的转移与化形问题也相当严重，去年评议商户负担分数时，曾发生了“行挤行”的现象。当按行分组评议负担时，有些商人形成集团，行里数谁户大谁就孤立，评议时故意加重其负担，降低自己税额。中药行万全堂资本最大，首先被挤垮，报了歇业。其次是同仁堂，评议时，由四百分提到七百多分，后经对商人教育才算解决。但实际已造成大商户恐惧的思想，因而有些商户实行化形经营，南关胡宝章杂货店取销门面变为行商，冯印来货架上没货，兄弟二人骑车跑买卖。一般反映：“不怕税重就怕负担不平衡”。像这样由座商变摊贩、行商或小贩的很多。但实际资本并未减少。更有的大户转入石家庄或乡村的。截至目前，城关共七百六十八个商户中，报歇业者已达一百零七户，在获鹿的税收上是个很大损失。
    根据上述情况，获鹿县各经济部门于三月中旬举行联席会议，检讨去年税务工作，并确定今年税收任务。会议认为：杜绝偷漏、平衡负担应为做好今年税收工作的主要关键。因此，会上根据省税务会议精神，及上级布置数字与去年完成数集镇多少、大小、交易情况、负担能力等，经过周密计划反复研究讨论，精打细算分配比较平衡，并决定大力贯彻政策，调整下层组织，设专人负责乡村工作，发动群众加强缉私杜绝偷漏税，发动全县干部买东西时检查印花，做好今年民主评议负担，加强对商人的教育，对故意逃避负担转移化形商人只要续报营业，即按原评议分数负担。此外，公营企业根据营业情况，确定税额。供销社、正太煤铁公司获鹿经营处、银行等总税额为十九万五千七百五十斤小米，占城关全部公私营工商企业纳税总额的百分之七十，按资金私营则超过公营数倍，说明了今年任务是不重的，加上计算较科学，干部对完成任务极有信心。                      （王祯）
