　　Launching Production for Self-Relief, Triumphantly Overcoming the Winter Famine
    Rehe Disaster Area Enters Spring Plowing
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st】The disaster-stricken people of Rehe Province, after several months of production self-relief efforts, have now triumphantly overcome the winter famine. They are currently continuing to overcome difficulties and are making every effort to carry out spring plowing and production.

    Last year, the province suffered from disasters such as wind, water, hail, and insects, affecting over 4.5 million mu of land. When the disaster occurred, in addition to urgently allocating one million jin of grain to relieve the disaster victims in the severely affected areas, the provincial Party and government leading organs promptly proposed organizing the disaster victims to carry out production self-relief and develop sideline production as the primary task of winter work. In January of this year, they dispatched over a thousand people in a disaster relief work group to 13 counties and banners to systematically organize the disaster victims to carry out production self-relief activities, initially stabilizing the disaster situation in the province.

    In late February, during the spring plowing season, new problems began to emerge in the disaster relief work, namely how to ensure the completion of spring plowing during the disaster and continue to implement production self-relief work. At that time, the severe disaster situation in the province had not yet passed, and some disaster victims were extremely short of seeds and fertilizers. Among the cadres, there was a tendency to unilaterally emphasize relief and neglect the mobilization of spring plowing. The Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Party Committee convened a disaster area work conference in late February, proposing that the current urgent task was to actively shift to spring plowing, continue to implement production self-relief, and truly ensure that no land was left uncultivated and no one starved to death. After the meeting, the head of the Provincial Party Committee led more than 900 cadres deep into the countryside to lead the peasants in actively shifting to spring plowing.

    Over the past few months, through the above-mentioned stages of effort, the situation in the disaster areas throughout the province has generally improved, and sideline production has also achieved initial results. According to statistics from 11 counties and banners, including Chengde and Qinglong, farmers' sideline production income in the most recent month and a half alone reached over 37 million jin of grain, basically overcoming the severe winter famine.

    The fact that Rehe Province's disaster relief work has achieved initial success proves that doing a good job in sales work is a powerful guarantee for promoting sideline production and overcoming disasters. State-owned trade organs in counties such as Chifeng and Longhua purchased a large amount of scrap copper and scrap iron around the Spring Festival, enabling local disaster victims to exchange it for over 100,000 jin of grain. In terms of purchasing methods, local cadres first investigated the production capacity of disaster victims and the local production conditions and sales of products in advance, and issued various sideline production certificates or disaster victim certificates. Then, the cooperatives purchased based on the certificates. This not only provided targeted care but also strengthened planning in production. In addition, the Rehe Provincial Gold Mine Administration also used 7 million jin of grain and over 20 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in cash to assist over 10,000 disaster victims in panning for gold. In addition to selling products through cooperatives, disaster victims in various border areas also actively organized the transportation and sale of sideline products to other provinces. For example, disaster victims in Fengning County, adjacent to Chabei, dispatched over 7,200 ox carts and more than 400 donkeys to exchange local products such as wooden carts, mats, and homespun cloth for 720,000 jin of grain. Last winter, the province's export of local products accounted for about 60 percent of the total export of local products in the province.

    The broad masses of rural women in the province also played a significant role in production self-relief efforts. According to incomplete statistics from six counties (banners), including Fengning and Lingyuan, over 167,000 women participated in various sideline production activities last winter. In some counties, the number of women participating in sideline production reached more than 90 percent of the total female labor force. The women in the above-mentioned counties earned a total of over 10 million jin of grain, generally enough to solve their own food problems at the very least, and some could even support two or three people.

    Although the disaster victims in Rehe have now overcome the winter famine, the difficulties in spring plowing have not yet been completely resolved. After careful study, the Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Party Committee proposed that this year, all male and female labor forces in the province should be mobilized and organized. Under the principle of focusing on agricultural production, surplus labor should be organized to engage in year-round sideline production, and it is required that the province complete a plan to earn 150,000 tons of grain through sideline production income this year. To this end, the Provincial People's Government has decided to allocate a total of over 52 million jin of grain for purchasing local products and as payment for work. In addition, the Provincial People's Government is also preparing to issue nearly 50 million jin of grain for production and disaster relief loans. Among them, over 18 million jin of loan grain, 150 billion yuan (Northeast currency) of agricultural loans, and 300,000 jin of fertilizer have already begun to be distributed.

### 开展生产自救胜利渡过冬荒  热河灾区进入春耕

　　开展生产自救胜利渡过冬荒
    热河灾区进入春耕
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】热河灾区灾民经过数月来的生产自救运动，现已胜利渡过冬荒。目前正在继续克服困难，全力进行春耕生产。
    该省去年遭风、水、雹、虫等灾，受害土地面积达四百五十余万亩。当灾荒发生后，省级党政领导机关除急拨一百万斤贷粮救济重灾区灾民外，又及时提出组织灾民进行生产自救发展副业生产为冬季工作的首要任务，并于今年一月派遣千余人之救灾工作团分赴十三个县旗有计划地组织灾民开展生产自救运动，使全省灾情初步稳定。
    今年二月下旬春耕时期，在救灾工作中又开始提出了新的问题，即如何在灾荒中保证春耕的完成和继续贯彻生产自救工作。当时全省灾情严重情况尚未过去，部分灾民种籽、肥料极为缺乏，在干部思想中则存在着片面强调救济、忽视动员春耕的偏向。该省人民政府及中共省委乃于二月下旬召开灾区工作会议，提出了当前的紧急任务是积极转入春耕，继续贯彻生产自救，真正做到不荒一亩地、不饿死一个人。会后，中共省委负责人率领九百余干部深入农村，领导农民积极转入春耕。
    数月以来，经过上述各个阶段的努力，全省灾区情况一般已有好转，副业生产亦获得初步成绩。据承德、青龙等十一县旗的统计，仅在最近一个半月中农民副业生产收入即达粮食三千七百余万斤，基本上战胜了严重的冬荒。
    热河省的救灾工作获得初步成绩的事实，证明了把推销工作做好是推动副业生产克服灾荒的有力保证。赤峰、隆化等县的国营贸易机关在春节前后曾收购了大批碎铜、废铁，使当地灾民换得粮食十余万斤。在收购方法上，首先由当地干部事先调查灾民生产能力和当地生产条件、产品销路情况，发给各种副业生产证或灾民证，然后由合作社凭证收购。这样既能重点照顾，又可加强生产中的计划性。此外，热河省金矿管理局亦以七百万斤粮食和二百余亿元（东北币）现款，扶助万余灾民淘金。各边区灾民除通过合作社销售产品外，并自动积极组织向外省运销副业产品，如邻近察北之丰宁县灾民曾出动七千二百余辆牛车和四百多头驴子，以当地出产之木车、席子、土布等换回粮食七十二万斤。去年冬季该省输出土产，约占全省土产输出总数百分之六十。
    该省广大农村妇女在生产自救工作中也起了很大作用。仅据丰宁、凌源六个县（旗）不完全统计，去冬参加了各种副业生产的妇女即达十六万七千余人。有的县份参加副业生产的妇女达到全体妇女劳动力的百分之九十以上。上述各县妇女共赚粮食一千余万斤，一般至少足够解决自己吃粮，有的还可养活二、三口人。
    目前热河灾民虽已渡过冬荒，但春耕中困难仍未完全解决。该省人民政府及中共省委经过缜密研究后，提出今年要将全省所有男女劳动力动员与组织起来，在以农业生产为主的原则下，组织剩余劳动力从事全年副业生产，要求今年内全省完成以副业生产收入十五万吨粮食的计划。为此，该省人民政府已决定拨发收购土产和以工代赈粮共达五千二百余万斤。此外，该省人民政府并准备发放近五千万斤的生产救灾贷粮。其中一千八百余万斤贷粮和一千五百亿元（东北币）农业贷款和三十万斤肥田粉均已开始发放。
