Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, April 23rd – The People's Liberation Army, after landing on Hainan Island and clearing the remaining enemy forces on the coast, continued to advance deeper inland, liberating Chengmai County and Meitai City. A unit of the PLA first surrounded Meitai on the night of the 18th, where the enemy's 156th Division headquarters, the entire 466th Regiment, and the 475th Regiment (excluding the 1st and 9th companies) of the 159th Division were attempting to block our army's advance. The attack was launched on the morning of the 19th. After three hours of fierce fighting, the majority of the defending enemy were annihilated, and the remainder scattered. Our army immediately liberated Meitai City. In this battle, our army captured 650 enemy officers and soldiers, including the deputy commander of the 475th Regiment, Wei Kefei. More than 300 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. The captured supplies included four mortars, nine 60mm mortars, thirty-seven light and heavy machine guns, and more than 320 rifles and short guns. Another unit of the PLA pursued and captured more than 100 officers and soldiers from the 64th Army's direct unit who were fleeing from Jialai City (south of Lingao). Subsequently, with swift action, they liberated Chengmai County in northern Qiong on the morning of the 21st. The defending enemy's 62nd Army direct unit fled upon hearing the news.
