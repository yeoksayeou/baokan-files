　　Beware of the Rampant Wheat Sawfly This Year
　　Zhu Hongfu
　　The wheat sawfly is one of the major pests of wheat. It specifically harms wheat, and once it breeds in large numbers, it can become a widespread major pest. According to a report from Dingxing County in late April last year, 1,500 mu of wheat were damaged in the five villages of Jiaolan Gou, Julan Gou, Liulan Gou, Changjiaying, and Yin Huangying in the seventh district. Farmers from Jiaolan Gou and Julan Gou collectively organized to catch them, collecting about 1.5 dou in about two hours. In Caiying Village, Anci County, Hebei Province, nearly 100 mu of wheat fields were damaged, and in two hours, 46 people caught 8.5 jin. Near Baisipo in Junxian County, about 40,000 mu of wheat were damaged across an area five li wide and more than thirty li long. Because the villagers called it the small armyworm, or even had no name for it, reporting and feedback were hindered. If a careful investigation and statistics were conducted in various places, the losses from the damage would definitely be significant.
　　The wheat sawfly is a type of sawfly, a new species in the world, with a black body and a light brown patch on its chest. It is 8 to 9 mm long. The larva is greenish-blue with a yellow head, and the largest is nearly 2 mm long. It only occurs once a year. Adults emerge in late March and have an egg-laying period of about ten days, laying eggs in wheat leaves. Each female can lay 50 to 60 eggs. The egg stage lasts for ten days, so the larvae hatch in early April and harm the wheat leaves. The larvae have five instars, and the damaging period on wheat lasts about 27 days. By early May, they enter the soil for dormancy, pupating in early October and then overwintering. They emerge again in late March of the following year.
　　The masses usually discover wheat sawfly larvae in late April or early May. In fact, this is when they are about to enter the soil for dormancy. According to our investigation, there are particularly many adults this year—more than ten times more than last year. If there is heavy rain in April, it can kill some of the adults and prevent them from laying eggs and reproducing. If there is little rain in April, the larvae will develop smoothly, and there is a possibility of them becoming rampant. Our survey this year covered Tong County, Nanyuan, and the four suburbs of Beijing. We felt that there were particularly many adults this year. The masses may not yet know that the larvae that will cause damage in the future are produced by the current adults. It will be too late to discover the disaster when it has already occurred at the end of April.
　　Most stomach poisons can kill sawfly larvae. Derris root powder can be diluted 300 to 500 times with water, or lead arsenate can be mixed at a rate of one jin to 200 to 250 jin of water. Both of these agents are available for purchase in the market. However, when it is impossible to buy medicine in the countryside, the habit of wheat sawfly larvae falling to the ground when startled can be used. Once larvae are discovered, control should be initiated immediately. Shake the wheat plants and then kill the larvae that have fallen to the ground. Although this method is somewhat clumsy, everyone can implement it. Because wheat sawflies overwinter in the soil six or seven inches deep in the wheat fields, winter plowing is very important for prevention, as it can expose the overwintering pupae on the surface of the soil to be pecked at by birds and animals. Also, because the larvae enter the soil for dormancy near the original wheat roots in mid-May, and the migration ability of adults is very weak, the method of crop rotation is also effective.

　　谨防今年麦叶蜂猖獗
    朱弘复
    麦叶蜂是小麦的主要害虫之一，它专害小麦，一旦繁殖很多时，便可成为普遍性的大害虫。据去年四月底定兴县的报告：在七区焦兰沟、巨兰沟、刘兰沟、常家营、尹黄营等五个村，有一千五百亩麦子被害。经焦兰沟和巨兰沟两村的农民集体组织起来捕捉，约两小时工夫，就捉了一斗半。在冀中安次县蔡营村麦田，也有近百亩麦地被害，在两小时内，四十六人打了八斤半。浚县白寺坡附近，也有宽五里长三十余里约四万亩麦子被害。因老乡们叫它为小黏虫，或竟没有名称，所以报告和反映上生了障碍，如果仔细在各地调查统计一下，为害的损失一定很大。
    麦叶蜂是一种锯蜂，在世界上是一个新种，全身黑色，胸前有一块淡褐色，体长八至九粍，幼虫青绿色，头黄色，最大的近二粍长，一年只发生一次。成虫在三月下旬羽化，产卵期约十日，产卵于小麦叶片中，每雌蜂可产卵五至六十粒，卵期为十日，故四月上旬即孵化为幼虫，在麦叶上为害。幼虫共五龄，在麦上为害期约二十七天，至五月上旬即入土休眠，到十月初化蛹，然后越冬。至明年三月下旬再羽化。
    群众发现麦叶蜂幼虫为害，都是在四月底五月初，事实上这时候已是它快要入土休眠的时候了。照我们的调查，今年成虫特别多——比去年多到十倍以上。如果在四月里能遇大雨，也可以打死一部分成虫，阻止它产卵繁殖，如果四月里雨少，幼虫发育顺利，那便有猖獗的可能。我们今年调查的范围为通县、南苑及北京四郊，感觉到今年的成虫特别多，群众也许还没有知道将来为害的幼虫，便是现在的成虫产生出来的，等到四月底灾害已成，那时发觉便晚了。
    除治的方法，大部分胃毒剂都可杀死锯蜂幼虫，鱼藤根粉稀释三百至五百倍水，或砒酸铅一斤，加水二百至二百五十斤。这两种药剂都是我们现在可以在市上买到的。但是乡村中买不到药的时候，可以利用麦叶蜂幼虫受惊堕地的习性，一俟发现幼虫，立即开始防治。振动麦株，然后把堕在地上的幼虫杀死。这办法虽然笨些，可是大家都能实行使用。因为麦叶蜂越冬都在麦地里六七寸深的土中，所以冬耕预防很重要，可以使越冬蛹暴露在土面上，被鸟兽啄食。又因为幼虫在五月中，即在原来的麦根附近入土休眠，成虫的迁移能力又很弱，所以轮作的方法也有效。
