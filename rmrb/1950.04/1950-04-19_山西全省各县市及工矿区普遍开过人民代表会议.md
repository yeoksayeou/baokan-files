　　[This News] Since the Shanxi Provincial Government Committee issued the decision and instructions to convene people's representative conferences of all circles in September last year, all county, city, industrial and mining area, and urban district people's representative conferences under the province have been universally convened one after another by the end of March this year (excluding the 28 counties incorporated into Jinan in January this year). Among them, Taiyuan City was the earliest, and it has now held two sessions and seven meetings. Sixteen counties including Changzhi and Huguan have also held two sessions.

　　Through the people's representative conferences of all circles in various cities and counties, first, the government has understood the urgent demands of the masses, which provides a basis for the government's future policy decisions. Second, it has dispelled the masses' concerns and improved the masses' enthusiasm for production. For example, in Pingyao County, before the representative conference, the masses did not understand the land reform policy and had concerns, and their enthusiasm for production was not high. After the representative conference, the representatives conveyed the information to the villages, and the masses' enthusiasm changed significantly. For example, after hearing the representatives' transmission, the masses in Dawang Village immediately bought seven pigs, four large livestock, and sixty sheep, and gathering firewood and accumulating fertilizer became very common. Third, it has improved the masses' sense of ownership and strengthened the relationship between the government and the people. After the representative conference, the representatives frequently reported work, reflected situations, and raised questions to the resident agencies or the government. For example, in Yuci, there was also a farmer representative in his sixties who, because he could not write, personally went to the city to report work to the government. Fourth, it has strengthened the responsibility of cadres and the mass viewpoint. With the supervision of the people, cadres must work harder and improve their vigilance against making mistakes; and from practice, they have experienced the significant role of the representative conference in completing various work tasks and implementing policies and laws, and feel that this is the best leadership method.

　　According to materials from various places, there are still many shortcomings in the work process that need to be overcome and corrected in the future. Such as: (1) Some cadres do not have enough understanding of the people's representative conferences, thinking that they are "unnecessary" and "troublesome"; some do not do enough preparation work before the meeting, resulting in the issues discussed at the meeting being disconnected from the central work and achieving little results. (2) Not enough attention is paid to the breadth and representativeness of the representatives. Many counties have raised the standards for representatives, thus narrowing the scope of representatives, limiting them to cadres, party members, and activists. Even worse, some counties do not pay attention to the purity of the representatives, only wanting those who are "eloquent," resulting in even opium addicts and hooligans being elected. (3) Some counties have failed to use the most important issues urgently demanded by the masses as the central content of the meeting, resulting in too many centers and too many resolutions; and in individual counties, the meeting center was subjectively decided in advance, and temporary changes were made at the meeting due to representatives raising opinions, resulting in a lack of preparation and a state of confusion. (4) Some counties neglect to listen to the voices of the masses as the basis for the government's future policies, with more reports and less discussion, leaving representatives with no opportunity to speak. Even worse, some emphasize centralization and neglect democracy, reducing the role of the representatives. (5) Many counties only issue the meeting resolutions without planning or systematically conveying and implementing them in depth, so that the meeting resolutions remain on paper, having little impact on the masses, and therefore failing to achieve practical results.

### 山西全省各县市及工矿区普遍开过人民代表会议

　　山西全省各县市及工矿区普遍开过人民代表会议
    【本报讯】山西省自去年九月省府委员会发出召开各界人民代表会议的决定和指示后，迄今年三月底止，全省所属各县、市、工矿区、城关区的各界代表会议均已先后普遍召开（今年一月份划入晋南的二十八县除外）。其中以太原市最早，现已开过二届七次，长治、壶关等十六县亦已开过二次。
    通过各市县各界人民代表会，第一，政府了解了当前群众的迫切要求，使政府今后施政决策更有所依据。第二，是打破了群众顾虑，提高了群众生产情绪。如平遥县在代表会前，群众对土改政策不了解，存有顾虑，生产情绪不高。开过代表会，代表们回村后都作了传达，群众情绪有了显著转变。如大王村群众听了代表的传达后，就马上买了七口猪、四头大牲口和六十只羊，打柴积肥尤为普遍。第三，是提高了群众主人翁的感觉，密切了政府与人民的关系。代表会后，代表们经常给驻会机关或政府报告工作，反映情况，提出问题。如榆次还有一位六十多岁的农民代表，因不会写字，亲自进城向政府报告工作。第四，是加强了干部责任心和群众观点。有了人民的监督，干部更要努力工作，提高了对犯错误的警惕；并从实际中体验到代表会对完成各种工作任务及贯彻政策法令的重大作用，感到这是最好的领导方法。
    根据各地材料，在工作过程中，尚存在着不少缺点，亟需今后注意克服与纠正。如：（一）部分干部对各界代表会认识不够，以为是“多此一举”、“找麻烦”；有的开会前准备工作做的不够，以致会上发生讨论的问题和中心工作脱节等现象，收效很小。（二）代表的广泛性与代表性注意不够。不少县将代表标准提高，致缩小了代表的范围，限于干部、党员和积极分子的圈子里。更有部分县份不注意代表的纯洁性，光要“能说会道”的，结果连大烟鬼二流子也选上了。（三）有些县未能根据群众迫切要求的最主要问题作为会议中心内容，形成中心多、决议多；并有个别县事前主观决定了会议中心，在会上因代表提意见而临时变化，结果形成毫无准备，手忙脚乱。（四）有些县忽视听取群众呼声，作为政府今后政策依据，报告多，讨论少，使代表无机会发言。更有的强调集中，忽视民主，降低了代表的作用。（五）不少县，只将会议决议发下去，未能有计划有步骤的深入传达与贯彻，使会议决议停留在纸面上，在群众中影响不大，因而也未能收到实效。
