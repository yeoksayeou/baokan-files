Xinhua News Agency, March 31st -- As war-mongers hold a series of aggressive military meetings in The Hague, it has aroused increasingly high protests from the Dutch working people. According to a TASS dispatch from The Hague on the 29th: People from many towns and villages in the Netherlands are constantly sending protest letters to The Hague. The Dutch Peace Committee specifically issued a declaration exposing that the sole purpose of the Hague conference is to "make final preparations to approve the plan to attack Eastern European countries." "Their only hope is to launch a war that destroys everything." The Peace Committee called on the Dutch working people to hold demonstrations on April 1st, the opening day of the North Atlantic Group "Defense Committee," to express to the war-mongering conference participants in The Hague their firm determination to fight for peace and international friendship. On April 1st, many "peace travel teams" from all over the Netherlands will also arrive in The Hague to participate in the demonstration.
