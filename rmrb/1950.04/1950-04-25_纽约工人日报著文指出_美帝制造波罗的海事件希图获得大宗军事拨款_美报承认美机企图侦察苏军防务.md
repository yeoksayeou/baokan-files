　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 21st (TASS): An editorial in the New York Worker's Daily pointed out that the State Department and the Defense Department's efforts to stimulate the American people using the loss of an American aircraft over the Baltic Sea are related to the desire to obtain large military appropriations. The newspaper revealed that publications of large enterprises have been predicting that "incidents" would occur on the Soviet border in the spring. Many companies are eager for larger military orders. Vinson, chairman of the House Military Committee, is trying to use the so-called Baltic Sea incident as an argument for increasing military appropriations. The newspaper stated: "We now see this terrible arithmetic - ten American pilots lost their lives, sacrificed to obtain another appropriation of $583 million." The newspaper pointed out: As the newspaper predicted, further "incidents" will probably occur "when Congress votes on new war appropriations." The fabrication of rumors of possible "incidents" has also greatly aided the movements of Monett and McCarthy to outlaw American civil rights, the Communist Party, and the peace movement. The highest-level groups, determined to engage in the most arrogant and provocative adventures, are sacrificing the entire country in the most unscrupulous and fraudulent manner. The newspaper urged the people to protest "this official group that is willing to exchange not only the lives of ten American pilots, but also the lives of millions of people, for military orders."
　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 22nd (TASS): The Christian Science Monitor's Washington correspondent, Harsch, frankly admitted that current information indicates that the missing American aircraft was engaged in reconnaissance work to seek information about Soviet defenses. Harsch wrote: "We want to know as precisely as possible what work is being carried out at the Soviet naval base. ... The reason we are interested in Soviet military activities in the Baltic Sea region is that presumptive evidence proves that the missing American aircraft in the Baltic Sea was engaged in some kind of reconnaissance activity." Harsch's report thus refuted the American official claim that the missing aircraft was on a "normal" flight. Harsch also talked about the possibility of a recurrence of provocative reconnaissance flights by American aircraft.
　　Another Christian Science Monitor reporter, Stanford, admitted that evidence indicates that the missing American aircraft was engaged in a reconnaissance mission. The assumption that the missing aircraft was engaged in reconnaissance work "is due to the strong revelation of the following information: First, the aircraft carried an unusually large number of personnel, as many as ten, including radar experts; second, it crossed the German coast east of Jutland, and Jutland is the easternmost point that could be reached; third, its destination was indeed Copenhagen, but only as the last apex of a triangular route in the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea "triangle" route from near Lübeck to Copenhagen will inevitably involve some reconnaissance work on the Soviet-defended Baltic Sea coast; fourth, the aircraft stopped sending radio signals from the time it crossed the German coast; fifth, Western military figures are extremely interested in the development rate of the Soviet radar network. The Baltic Sea coast may be the place where this type of radar network is developed first. And it is well known that the United States is exploring this radar network by all means."

　　纽约工人日报著文指出
    美帝制造波罗的海事件希图获得大宗军事拨款
    美报承认美机企图侦察苏军防务
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：纽约工人日报的社论指出：国务院与国防部利用在波罗的海上空损失一架美国飞机的事情来刺激美国人民的努力，是和希图获得大笔军事拨款的愿望有关的。该报揭示：大企业的刊物一直就在预言：春季将有“事件”在苏联边界发生。许多公司正渴望更大宗的军事定货。众院军委会主席文森企图利用所谓波罗的海事件，作为增加军事拨款的论据。该报称：“我们现在看见这种可怕的算术——十个美国飞行员失了纵，成为获取另外一笔五亿八千三百万元的拨款的牺牲品。”该报指出：正如报纸所预言的，进一步的“事件”大概还会在“国会表决新的战争拨款的时候发生。可能发生“事件”的谣言的制造，也大大帮助了蒙特与麦加锡图使美国公民权利、共产党与和平运动成为非法的运动。决心要从事最狂妄的挑衅性冒险的最高级集团，正在用最没有人心和最欺诈的手法把全国当作牺牲品”。该报敦促人民抗议“这个愿意不仅用十个美国飞行员的生命，而且用千百万人民的生命交换军事定货的官方集团。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：基督教科学箴言报驻华盛顿记者哈希坦白地承认：现有消息指明，失踪的美国飞机系从事侦察工作，以寻求有关苏联防务的情报。哈希写道：“我们想尽可能确实地知道在苏联海军基地上在进行什么工作。……我们对苏联在波罗的海地区的军事活动感到兴趣的理由就是，推定的证据证明在波罗的海失踪的美国飞机在从事某种侦察活动。”哈希的报道就这样驳倒了美国官方所称失踪飞机在作“普通”飞行的说法。哈希并谈到美国飞机挑衅性侦察飞行重演的可能性。
    另一个基督教科学箴言报记者史坦福承认证据指明：失踪的美国飞机在从事侦察任务。失踪飞机在从事侦察工作的假定，“是由于下列消息的强烈启示：第一，该机所载人员异乎寻常的多，竟有十人，其中并有雷达专家；第二，它在日德兰东面越过德国海岸，而日德兰已是可能飞到的极东地点；第三，它的目的地确实是哥本哈根，但是，仅仅作为波罗的海上三角航路的最后一个顶角。从卢卑格附近起到哥本哈根为止的波罗的海“三角”航路，将不可避免地要牵涉到在苏军防守的波罗的海海岸从事某种侦察工作；第四，飞机从越过德国海岸时起，就停止拍发无线电；第五，西方军事人士对苏联的雷达网的发展速率极感兴趣。波罗的海海岸也许是尽先发展这类雷达网的地方。而美国正以一切手段探试这种雷达网，这已是尽人皆知的了”。
