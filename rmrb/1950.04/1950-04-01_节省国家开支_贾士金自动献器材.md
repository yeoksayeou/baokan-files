　　Saving National Expenditures
    Jia Shijin Voluntarily Donates Materials
    [This Dispatch] In response to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding unified financial and economic work, Jia Shijin, a worker at the Baotou City Power Plant, voluntarily donated materials to save national expenditures. In 1948, when the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated, Jia Shijin picked up seventeen catties of No. 9 phosphor bronze wire and seven and a half catties of No. 11 wire in the wilderness. Now that the factory urgently needs them, Jia Shijin immediately voluntarily donated all of them. This spirit of caring for the factory and saving national expenditures is worthy of praise.

　　节省国家开支
    贾士金自动献器材
    【本报讯】包头市发电厂工人贾士金，为响应中央人民政府政务院关于统一财经工作的决定，自动献出器材，以节省国家开支。一九四八年国民党匪军撤退时，贾士金在野地里拾得磷铜电线九号的十七斤，十一号的七斤半。现因该厂正迫切需要，贾士金即自动全部献出。这种爱护工厂，节省国家开支的精神是值得加以表扬的。
