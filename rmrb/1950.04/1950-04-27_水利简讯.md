　　Water Conservancy Briefs
　　The Jin-Gao Irrigation Canal, fifty *li* long, in Jin County and Gao County, began diverting water from the head of the canal to the tail in mid-March. The masses in the sixty-seven benefiting villages along the canal recognize that using the canal for irrigation "can save labor and increase grain production," and are actively forming mutual aid groups to engage in intensive irrigation.
　　By the end of last month, the masses from the twenty-second branch canal tail to the sixteenth branch canal had irrigated 1,300 *mu* of wheat and over 12,000 *mu* of uncultivated land. Last year, the Jin-Gao Irrigation Canal completed the irrigation of 30,000 *mu* of land, enabling the sixty-seven benefiting villages along the canal to increase grain production by approximately 1.62 million *jin*. The Jin-Gao District Irrigation Association plans to build forty-seven new small branch canals in the first half of this year to complete the irrigation of 40,000 *mu* of land. (Zhao Zhiguo, Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee)
　　The People's Government of Licheng County, Shanxi Province, in order to prevent drought and increase production, and to exceed pre-war levels of agricultural production this year, has selected Longwang Village in the Second District of the county as the key area for canal construction. The canal project commenced on March 26 and is scheduled to be completed by May 1. The canal will convert 650 *mu* of land into paddy fields, which can increase grain production by 4 *dou* per *mu*, for a total increase of 260 *shi* of coarse grains.
　　The Spring Work Committees of the counties in the upper reaches of the Yongding River held a meeting at the end of March, deciding to repair a total of twenty-seven dangerous sections along the entire river and restore 600,000 cubic meters of embankment soil. The meeting decided: 1. Seize the opportunity during the agricultural slack season to mobilize the civilian labor force to focus on embankment restoration in the first half of April and May, with military labor starting in early April. All embankment projects will be completed before the flood season. 2. Complete a comprehensive inspection of the dikes by April 15 to ensure that there are no leaks along the dikes and to eliminate harmful animals. 3. Break down mass superstition and educate the masses that only by managing the river well can production and life be guaranteed. 4. Emphasize checking tools, organization, physical strength, and any concerns of the civilian laborers. Construction will not begin if preparations are not well made.

    晋藁两县五十华里的晋藁，灌溉渠，三月中旬，由渠头向渠尾引水。沿渠六十七个受益村群众，认识到用渠浇地“能省工，又能多打粮”，正自动组成互助小组，紧张的浇地。
    至上月底，自二十二支渠尾到十六支渠的群众，已浇麦一千三百亩，浇白地一万二千余亩。去年晋藁灌溉渠完成三万亩浇地任务，使沿渠六十七个受益村，增产粮食约一百六十二万斤。晋藁区灌溉总会计划于今年上半年修筑四十七条新小支渠，完成四万亩浇地任务。（石家庄地委会赵志国）
    山西省黎城县人民政府，为了防旱增产，使今年农业生产超过战前水平，选出该县二区隆旺村为开渠重点。开渠工程于三月二十六日开工，决定在五月一日前完工。该渠可使六百五十亩地变为水田，每亩可增粮四斗，计可增产粗粮二百六十市石。
    永定河上游各县春工委员会于三月底举行会议，决定全河共修险二十七处，复堤六十万公方土，会议决定：一、抓紧农闲，计划民工复堤在四、五月的前半月进行突击，军工在四月初动工。复堤工程均在上汛前完成。二、四月十五日完成普遍堤防大检查，作到沿堤无漏，消灭害兽。三、打破群众迷信，向群众宣传，只有将河治好，生产、生活才能保障。四、强调检查工具、组织、体力、与民工有什么顾虑。准备工作作不好不开工。
