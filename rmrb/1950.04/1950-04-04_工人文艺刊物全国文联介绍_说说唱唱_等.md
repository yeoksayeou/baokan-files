To the editors of Worker Literature Journal, All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles introduces "Singing and Talking," etc.:

　　I have some opinions about the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. They publish many literary journals, but not many are popular. Many workers like poetry and novels, and some workers even memorize a poem or write it on the wall, which shows how much workers need literature. However, the journals published by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles have long articles that workers don't understand very well, and they are also very expensive. I hope that the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles can publish a journal that is short, small, cheap, and publishes many works by workers; and I hope that distribution stations can be established in major enterprises to actively sell them to workers.
                                              Reader Feng Guowu

　　Dear Mr. Feng Guowu:

　　Your letter suggesting the publication of a worker literature journal has been forwarded to us by the People's Forum. We think your opinion is very good and worth considering in our work plan. At present, it is not that there are no literary journals available for workers to read, such as "Singing and Talking" (published by Xinhua Bookstore), Worker Literature (published by Tangshan Trade Union), as well as the supplements of Worker's Daily and Xinmin Daily; the newspapers and journals published by cities and trade unions in various places also have literary content, and most of these publications are in contact with worker comrades. At present, it is still very difficult to publish a national worker literature journal, given the work situation and subjective strength of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. However, we feel that when conditions permit in the future, we should plan for it.

　　Secretariat, All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles

### 工人文艺刊物全国文联介绍“说说唱唱”等

　　工人文艺刊物全国文联介绍“说说唱唱”等编辑同志：
    我对全国文协有点意见，就是他们出的文艺刊物不少，但大众化的还不多。有许多工人很欢喜诗歌、小说一类的东西，有些工人甚至把一首诗歌背的烂熟或写在墙上，由此我们可知工人是多么需要文艺。可是全国文协出的几本刊物，文章很长，工人不太看得懂，价钱又很贵。我希望全国文协能办一个又短又小又便宜，登的工人作品又多的刊物；并希望在各大企业建立发行站，主动的去卖给工人。

    冯国梧君：
    你建议办一个工人文艺刊物的信，已由人民园地转到我们这里来了。我们觉得你的意见很好，值得我们在工作计划中考虑。目前可供工人们阅读的文艺刊物并不是完全没有的，如“说说唱唱”（新华书店出版）、工人文艺（唐山工会出版）以及工人日报副刊、新民报副刊等；各地城市及工会出版的报纸刊物中，也有文艺的篇幅，这些出版物大部分都和工人同志有联系的。目前要办一个全国性的工人文艺刊物，从文协的工作情况与主观力量来讲，还有很多困难。不过我们觉得以后条件允许时，还要予以进行筹划的。
