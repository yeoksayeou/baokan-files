Hungary's Fifth Anniversary of Liberation
    By Delage Hess, Chairman of the National Assembly of Hungary

    Today, April 4, 1950, the People's Republic of Hungary celebrates a great day, the fifth anniversary of the victorious Soviet army driving all German troops out of Hungarian territory. This day allowed the Hungarian working people to break free from the shackles of domestic feudal forces and capitalism; this day opened up the path to socialist construction. April 4th marks a turning point in Hungarian history and is one of the greatest holidays of the People's Republic of Hungary.

    Before liberation, Hungary was oppressed externally by German imperialism and internally exploited by landlords and capitalists. Before 1945, Hungary was a country with landlords owning hundreds of thousands of acres of land, and also with so-called "three million beggars," landless poor peasants. Extremely high infant mortality rates and many other diseases took the lives of many Hungarians; industry was controlled by a small number of capitalists who wanted to make the country subservient to the interests of Western imperialism. The Hungarian authorities in power between the two world wars did not pay attention to the cultural needs of the working people. The children of the working people did not receive education, and the broad masses were isolated from the world of art. The Communist Party, the only active force in the country, could only operate underground at that time. At the end of World War I, with the collapse of the Habsburg dynasty, the Horthy regime came to power. In order to serve the interests of landlords and capitalists, Horthy oppressed the working people with fascist methods. The Communist Party, which led the working people, had to go underground at that time.

    Although the repression and persecution by the reactionary regime were endless, the Communists continued to fight for the working people. A brilliant page in this struggle was the case of Comrade Rakosi, the leader of the Hungarian working people: Rakosi was subjected to cruel itinerant trials and various persecutions by the Horthy regime in 1934, but he finally exposed the autocracy and tyranny of the Horthy regime to the world.

    During World War II, the rulers of Hungary turned the country into a vassal of German imperialism. Germany coerced Hungary into declaring war on the Soviet Union in an unconstitutional manner. As a result, tens of thousands of Hungarian sons were sent to the battlefield. It was not until the heroic Soviet army liberated Hungary that freedom was brought to the working people of Hungary. The Hungarian people are very good at using this freedom. The country, which was destroyed by the war and plundered by the German fascists and their lackeys, is now being built by workers across the country under the guidance of the Communist Party. In the arduous struggle of construction, the Hungarian people have never forgotten the help and guidance given by the Soviet Union.

    After liberation, democratic Hungary solved a major problem that feudal Hungary could not solve—the implementation of land reform. The new country distributed the old feudal estates to 642,000 farm laborers. This was the first time in Hungarian history that land became the property of the working peasants. The Communist Party has been leading the struggle to improve the living conditions of peasants and striving to build socialism in the countryside. The working peasants learned from the example of the Soviet Union, and then drew conclusions from their own experience. In this way, they understood the benefits of collective farms and gradually promoted the organization of farm cooperatives. In terms of helping peasants, the government has also set up many tractor stations, promoted farm mechanization to replace manual labor, established water conservancy projects, electrified the countryside, and established cultural centers in various provinces.

    Five years have passed since liberation, and the working people have gradually gained the power to govern the country. On February 1, 1946, Hungary became a republic; on August 20, 1949, the country adopted a new constitution and became a people's democratic state. The working class, united under the Hungarian Workers' Party led by Rakosi, is learning from the example of the Soviet Union and moving towards socialism through democratic means. The working people have socialized industry and transportation, mines, banks, and most commercial institutions. The relationship between workers and workplaces has undergone fundamental changes. Workers work for themselves, and labor has become glorious and proud.

    In the past five years, the Hungarian democratic state has achieved great success in removing the cultural barriers left by the former ruling class. Today, in Hungarian middle schools and universities, a large number of children of peasants and workers are studying, a phenomenon that was impossible in the past. Moreover, newspapers and radios have reached the smallest villages, and workers and peasants are studying the works of Lenin and Stalin and the progressive thoughts and literature of Hungary and foreign countries. A large-scale cultural revolution is underway. They want to learn from the example of the Soviet Union and use their own experience to establish socialist art and realism.

    In these five years, Hungary has become a bastion of the international peace camp led by the Soviet Union. After exposing the various conspiracies of the remnants of the former ruling class, Anglo-American spies, and Trotskyites, Hungary has become more consolidated internally and stronger on the front lines of peace. The working people of Hungary have joined hands with other allies in the peace camp led by the Soviet Union; standing with the democratic People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, the working people of Hungary fully understand that their struggle is the same as the struggle of the Chinese Communist Party against domestic and foreign oppressors; the people of the two countries are on the same road, fighting side by side for the implementation of socialism.

    On this holiday, Hungarian workers extend their heartfelt sympathy to the liberated people of China. Hungary and China, this great country, are also moving towards the road to victory together with the help and guidance of the Soviet Union.

　　匈牙利解放五周年
    匈牙利国民议会主席  德拉何希
    在今天，一九五○年四月四日，匈牙利人民共和国要庆祝一个伟大的日子，这是胜利的苏联军队将德军全数逐出匈牙利土地之外的五周年纪念日。有了这一天，匈牙利的劳动人民才挣脱了国内封建势力和资本主义的枷锁；有了这一天，社会主义建设的大道才开拓出来。四月四日标志着匈牙利历史的转折点，它是匈牙利人民共和国一个最大的节日。
    解放前，匈牙利在外受到德国帝国主义的压迫，在内则受到大地主和资本家的榨取。一九四五年以前，匈牙利是一个有着拥有十万亩田地的大地主，同时也有着所谓“三百万乞丐”的无地的贫农的国家。极高的婴儿死亡率及很多其他疾病，夺去了多少匈牙利人的生命；工业被统治在少数资本家的手里，他们是想使国家服从西方帝国主义的利益的。在两次大战间的匈牙利执政当局并没有关注到劳动人民的文化需要，劳动人民的孩子受不到教育，广大的群众被隔绝在艺术之门的外面。为全国唯一的积极力量的共产党在当时只能在地下活动。第一次世界大战结束时，随着哈布斯堡皇朝的倾复，霍尔第政权上了台。为了要符合地主和资本家的利益，霍尔第以法西斯手段压迫着劳动人民。领导着劳动人民的共产党那时也不得不转入地下。
    虽然反动政权的压迫和残害是无尽的，共产党员们却仍为着劳动人民而继续奋斗着。这奋斗中灿烂的一页便是匈牙利劳动人民领袖拉科西同志的案件：拉科西在一九三四年受着霍尔第政权的残酷的巡回审判和种种迫害，但他终于将霍尔第政权的专制和暴虐都暴露于全世界。
    第二次世界大战时，匈牙利的统治者将国家变成了德国帝国主义的附庸。德国胁迫着匈牙利以不合宪法的情形来向苏联宣战。于是，成万的匈牙利人民的儿子被送上了战场。直至英勇的苏军解放了匈牙利，才将自由带给了匈牙利的劳动人民。匈牙利人民是很会利用这份自由的，这为战争所破坏而又为德国法西斯和它的奴才所掠夺的国家，目前正由全国工人遵着共产党的指导建设起来。在建设的艰苦奋斗中，匈牙利人民从来没有忘记苏联所给予的帮助和指导。
    解放后，民主的匈牙利解决了封建匈牙利所无法解决的一个大问题——实行土地改革。新国家将旧时的封建采邑分配给了六十四万二千家农场的苦工。这在匈牙利历史上还是第一次让土地成为劳苦农民的财产。共产党一直领导着改进农民生活情况的斗争，并为在乡村里建立社会主义而努力。劳苦的农民学习着苏联的榜样，然后从他们自己的经验中吸取结论。这样他们明白了集体农场的好处，便逐步推行农场合作社的组织了。在帮助农民方面，政府也设立了很多拖拉机站，提倡农场机械劳动以代替人力，建立水利计划，电化乡村，及在各省设立文化中心等。
    自解放以来，五年过去了，劳动人民已逐渐取得了治理国家的权力。一九四六年二月一日，匈牙利成为一个共和国；一九四九年八月二十日，国家采用了新宪法，成为一个人民民主国家。工人阶级在拉科西所领导的匈牙利工人党底下，团结起来，学习苏联的榜样，经由民主的道路走向社会主义。劳动人民将工业和运输机构、矿山、银行及大部分商业机关都社会主义化了。工人和工作间的关系起了根本的改变，工人为他们自己工作，劳动成了光荣和可骄傲的事。
    过去五年中，匈牙利民主国家在扫除以前的统治阶级所留下的文化障碍中获得极大的成功。如今在匈牙利的中学和大学里，大批的农民和工人的子女在读书，这种现象在过去是不可能的。而且现在，书报和收音机都到了最小的村庄里，工人和农民都在研读列宁和斯大林的著作及匈牙利和外国的进步思想和文学。一个大规模的文化革命正在进行中，他们要学习苏联的榜样，利用他们自己的经验来树立社会主义的艺术和现实主义。
    在这五年里，匈牙利成了由苏联领导的国际和平阵营的堡垒。在揭破了以前的统治阶级的余孽、英美的间谍及托派等的种种阴谋后，匈牙利内部更趋巩固，在和平的前哨也更坚强起来。匈牙利的劳动人民已在苏联所领导的和平阵营里和其他盟友拉紧了手；和属于人民的、民主的中国及其他人民民主国家站在一起，匈牙利的劳动人民已充分了解他们的斗争是和中国共产党反抗国内外压迫者的斗争一样的；两国人民正在同一条道路上，为实行社会主义而并肩作战。
    在这个节日，匈牙利工人以由衷的同情心来慰问中国被解放了的人民。匈牙利和中国这个伟大的国家，正同样在苏联的帮助和指导下，一起走向胜利的道路。                                  （李秋德译）（附图片）
