Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The full text of the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals is as follows:

(I) Attracting the people to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and periodicals, and educating Party members, especially Party cadres, to make self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals about these shortcomings and errors, is of more prominent importance today. Because today the war on the mainland has ended, our Party has led the national regime, and the shortcomings and errors in our work can easily harm the interests of the broad masses of the people. Moreover, due to the position of leadership of the regime and the increase in the prestige of the leaders, it is easy to generate arrogance and reject and suppress criticism inside and outside the Party. Due to the emergence of these new situations, if we cannot openly and promptly launch criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings and errors of our Party's People's Government and all economic organs and mass organizations among the entire Party and the broad masses of the people, we will be seriously poisoned by bureaucracy and will not be able to complete the task of building a new China. For these reasons, the CPC Central Committee has specially decided: to launch criticism and self-criticism of all errors and shortcomings in our work in all public occasions, among the people, and especially in newspapers and periodicals.

(II) In order to openly and correctly launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, education should be conducted in two aspects within the Party and among the people. First, Party members, especially cadres, must be educated to recognize that conducting criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals is a necessary method for consolidating the Party's ties with the people, ensuring the democratization of the Party and the state, and accelerating social progress. Enabling the people to freely express their criticisms and suggestions of the Party and the People's Government in newspapers and periodicals, even if these criticisms and suggestions are not fully mature or completely correct, and that they will not be attacked or ridiculed as a result, is a serious step in raising the people's awareness and enthusiasm, and attracting the people to actively participate in the cause of national construction. Therefore, the Party's leadership organs and cadres at all levels must adopt a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and firmly protecting criticism that reflects the opinions of the masses, and oppose the bureaucratic attitude of ignoring mass criticism, restricting its publication, and retaliating against, persecuting, and ridiculing critics. This is the main aspect today. Second, the editorial staff, reporters, correspondents, and the people should also be educated to distinguish between correct criticism and destructive criticism. The criticism we advocate is principled, constructive, and well-intentioned criticism by the people (primarily workers and peasants) for the purpose of promoting and consolidating the cause of national construction, and not destructive criticism aimed at opposing the people's democratic system and the Common Program, undermining discipline and leadership, undermining the people's confidence and enthusiasm in advancing, and creating pessimistic and disappointed sentiments and a state of disunity and division. The editorial staff, reporters, correspondents, and reading groups of newspapers and periodicals should welcome and lead correct criticism and oppose destructive criticism. Such destructive criticism, especially the remarks of counter-revolutionary elements undermining the people's democratic dictatorship, should and must be rejected.

(III) In order to ensure that criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals can be carried out smoothly and effectively, the CPC Central Committee has specially stipulated the following measures, and hopes that Party committees at all levels and Party newspaper workers will earnestly implement them:

	A. All criticisms published in newspapers and periodicals shall be the sole responsibility of the reporters and editors of the newspapers and periodicals. In the past, a method was practiced in many places whereby manuscripts criticizing Party and government organizations and personnel were sent to the criticized organizations and personnel for review, and published only after their consent was obtained. This method avoided many criticisms that were not fully factual or well-considered during the war, when investigation was inconvenient, but it is more harmful than beneficial and incorrect to continue to adopt this method in the current situation. In the future, newspaper and periodical personnel may and should still solicit the opinions of relevant departments on criticisms whose authenticity they cannot determine, but as long as the newspaper or periodical confirms that the criticism is basically correct, it should still be responsible for publishing it, even if it has not sought or obtained the consent of the criticized.

	B. The above-mentioned method also applies to the manuscripts of worker-peasant correspondents. The work of worker-peasant correspondents should be led by the newspapers and assisted by the Party organizations of the production units to which they belong. The activities of worker-peasant correspondents should be included as one of the items for checking the work of newspapers and the Party's work in each production unit. No one shall abuse their power to suppress the criticisms of worker-peasant correspondents in newspapers and periodicals, or retaliate against them.

	C. Beneficial criticisms in readers' letters, which newspapers and periodicals can judge to be true, should be published. Letter writers should inform the newspaper of their real name and address, but the newspaper may keep it confidential at the request of the letter writer.

	D. After criticism is published in newspapers and periodicals, if it is completely true, the criticized should immediately declare their acceptance in the same newspaper or periodical and announce the results of correcting the error. If it is partially untrue, the criticized should immediately make a factual correction in the same newspaper or periodical and accept the correct part of the criticism. If the criticized refuses to express their attitude, or retaliates against the critic, it shall be dealt with by the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee. The parts of the above-mentioned circumstances that violate administrative discipline and laws shall be handled by the state supervisory and judicial organs.

(IV) It is stipulated that Lenin's "On Our Newspapers," Stalin's "On Self-Criticism," "Against Vulgarizing the Slogan of Self-Criticism," Comrade Mao Zedong's discussion on self-criticism, and the Resolution of the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on Party and Soviet Newspapers and Periodicals shall be used as study materials for Party committees at all levels and Party newspapers and periodicals when discussing and implementing this decision.

(V) This decision applies to newspapers and periodicals led by the Party, but when non-Party newspapers and periodicals adopt the same correct attitude in the same spirit to criticize Party organizations and personnel, the Party shall also provide due cooperation and support in accordance with the same method.

### 中国共产党中央委员会  关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定

　　中国共产党中央委员会
    关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国共产党中央委员会关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定，全文如下：
    （一）吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并教育党员、特别是党的干部在报纸刊物上作关于这些缺点和错误的自我批评，在今天是更加突出地重要起来了。因为今天大陆上的战争已经结束，我们的党已经领导着全国的政权，我们工作中的缺点和错误很容易危害广大人民的利益，而由于政权领导者的地位，领导者威信的提高，就容易产生骄傲情绪，在党内党外拒绝批评，压制批评。由于这些新的情况的产生，如果我们对于我们党的人民政府的及所有经济机关和群众团体的缺点和错误，不能公开地及时地在全党和广大人民中展开批评与自我批评，我们就要被严重的官僚主义所毒害，不能完成新中国的建设任务。由于这样的原因，中共中央特决定：在一切公开的场合，在人民群众中，特别在报纸刊物上展开对于我们工作中一切错误和缺点的批评与自我批评。
    （二）为了公开地并且在报纸刊物上正确地展开批评和自我批评，应当在党内和人民中进行两方面的教育。第一，要教育党员特别是干部认识：在报纸刊物上进行批评和自我批评，是为了巩固党与人民群众的联系、保障党和国家的民主化、加速社会进步的必要方法。使得人民群众能够自由地在报纸刊物上发表他们对于党和人民政府的批评和建议，纵然这些批评和建议并非完全成熟与完全正确，而他们也不会因此受到打击与嘲笑，乃是提高人民群众的觉悟性和积极性，吸引人民群众踊跃参加国家建设事业的严重步骤。因此党的各级领导机关和干部必须对于反映群众意见的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，而反对对群众批评置之不理、限制发表和对批评者实行打击、报复与嘲笑的官僚主义态度。这在今天是主要的方面。第二，要同时教育报纸刊物的编辑人员、记者、通讯员和人民群众去区别正确的批评和破坏性的批评。我们所提倡的批评，乃是人民群众（首先是工人农民）以促进和巩固国家建设事业为目的的、有原则性有建设性的、与人为善的批评，而不是为着反对人民民主制度和共同纲领、为着破坏纪律和领导、为着打击人民群众前进的信心和热情，造成悲观失望情绪和散漫分裂状态的那种破坏性的批评。报纸刊物的编辑人员、记者、通讯员和读报组，应当欢迎和领导正确的批评而反对破坏性的批评。对于这种破坏性的批评，特别是反革命分子破坏人民民主专政的言论，则是应该而且必须加以拒绝的。
    （三）为了保障在报纸刊物上的批评和自我批评得以顺利而有效地进行，中共中央特规定下列各项办法，望各级党委与党报工作者切实地加以执行：
    甲、凡在报纸刊物上公布的批评，都由报纸刊物的记者和编辑负独立的责任。过去在许多地方曾经实行一种办法，就是把批评党和政府的组织与人员的稿件送给被批评的组织和人员阅看，在征得他们的同意后，才加以发表。这种办法，在战争期间调查不便的条件下，曾经避免了许多不完全符合实际的和不周到的批评，但是在现时的条件下继续采取这种办法却是害多利少的，不对的。在今后，报纸刊物的人员对于自己不能决定真伪的批评仍然可以而且应当征求有关部门的意见，但是只要报纸刊物确认这种批评在基本上是正确的，即令并未征求或并未征得被批评者的同意，仍然应当负责加以发表。
    乙、对于工农通讯员的稿件，同样适用上述办法。工农通讯员的工作，除由报纸领导外，并应由所属生产单位的党的组织加以协助。工农通讯员的活动状况，应列为检查报纸工作和各生产单位党的工作的项目之一。任何人不得滥用权力压制工农通讯员在报纸刊物上的批评，或加以报复。
    丙、读者来信中的有益的批评，凡报纸刊物能判断其为真实者，应当加以发表。投书者应将真实姓名住址告知报社，但报社得依投书者的要求代守秘密。
    丁、批评在报纸刊物上发表后，如完全属实，被批评者应即在同一报纸刊物上声明接受并公布改正错误的结果。如有部分失实，被批评者应即在同一报纸刊物上作出实事求是的更正，而接受批评的正确部分。如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会予以处理。上述情事触犯行政纪律法律的部分，应由国家监察机关司法机关予以处理。
    （四）规定列宁《论我们的报纸》，斯大林《论自我批评》、《反对把自我批评口号庸俗化》，毛泽东同志论自我批评，和俄共（布）第八次代表大会关于党的和苏维埃的报刊的决议作为各级党委和党报党刊在讨论和执行本决定时的学习资料。
    （五）本决定适用于党所领导的报纸和刊物，但党外报纸和刊物在同样精神上采取同样正确的态度批评党的组织和人员时，党也应当按照同样的办法给予应有的合作和支持。
      一九五○年四月十九日
