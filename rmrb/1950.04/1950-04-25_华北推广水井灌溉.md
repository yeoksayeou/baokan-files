　　Promoting Water Well Irrigation in North China
　　Xiao Ying

　　The average annual wheat yield of one mu of dry land in North China is 110 jin, while one mu of irrigated land can produce an average of more than 200 jin of wheat annually, more than doubling the yield of dry land.

　　In this year's national plan to increase food production by 10 billion jin and cotton production by 450 million jin, one of the important measures to guarantee increased production is to expand the irrigated area by 8.5 million mu. Among the expanded 8.5 million mu of irrigated area, it is stipulated that 2.77 million mu will be completed by promoting waterwheel wells. This is a huge task, requiring the addition of 111,500 new waterwheels and the repair of 52,700 old waterwheels. Waterwheel well irrigation is a small-scale irrigation project that is easy to develop and is relatively common in rural North China, especially in Hebei, where waterwheel and well irrigation covers an area of more than 9 million mu in the province alone.

　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, North China's farmers' use of waterwheel wells to irrigate farmland was already very developed. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the War of Liberation, it was severely damaged by the enemy and puppets. According to a 1948 survey by the Agricultural Department of the Jing-North China People's Government, the number of water wells filled and destroyed by the enemy and puppets or damaged due to the war accounted for 11.8% of the total number of water wells in the area, and waterwheels accounted for 25.8% of the total number of waterwheels in the area. After the land reform in the liberated areas of North China in 1947, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was particularly high, and turning dry land into irrigated land became a common demand of the emancipated farmers. Therefore, the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government established the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency in April 1948 to specifically develop the irrigation of waterwheel wells. At that time, the Border Region Government allocated a special fund of 29.92 million jin of millet to operate this project under very difficult financial circumstances. After the establishment of the North China People's Government, the agency became an organization for the entire North China region. After its establishment, the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency supported the production of waterwheel factories on the one hand and organized farmers to dig wells and borrow waterwheels on the other. In the past two years, the agency has mobilized farmers to dig 79,488 new wells and lent out 13,046 new waterwheels. Each waterwheel well can irrigate an average of 25 to 30 mu of land, and each well without a waterwheel can irrigate an average of 3 mu of land. Each mu of land can increase food production by an average of eight shi dou. In 1949, the benefits of water well irrigation in North China reached a huge amount of 69,787,700 jin of grain (referring only to the benefits of newly dug wells).

　　The Water Conservancy Promotion Agency is responsible for leading a series of tasks, from purchasing waterwheel raw materials and producing waterwheels to organizing farmers to dig wells and lend waterwheels. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the original Water Conservancy Promotion Agency of the North China Government systematically supported public and private waterwheel factories, supplying raw materials to each factory and purchasing their products. At present, the number of waterwheel factories has developed to 385. The Water Conservancy Promotion Agency also unified the production technology of each factory and designed new waterwheels. The new waterwheels are divided into two types: light-duty, suitable for deep water levels, weighing only 69 kilograms; 71 kilograms lighter than the lightest old-style waterwheel. Heavy-duty, suitable for shallow water levels, weighing only 76 kilograms; 64 kilograms lighter than the lightest old-style waterwheel. This new type of waterwheel saves a large amount of cast iron and reduces costs. In the past, a waterwheel averaged more than 1,300 jin of millet; the new waterwheel is less than 1,000 jin, averaging a reduction of half. Old waterwheels came in more than a dozen sizes, all of which were different, and it was difficult to add parts when they were damaged. The new waterwheels have certain specifications, and if the parts are damaged, the style can be stated and replaced at any time.

　　At the same time, the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency has mastered the more important task of promoting waterwheels to farmers. First, the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency sends cadres to the countryside to cooperate with local staff to carry out extensive publicity. They use market days and temple fairs to post advertisements, publish wall newspapers, and make oral propaganda. They install waterwheels on wells by the roadside, test them for farmers to see, and let farmers test them themselves so that farmers can see with their own eyes that the new waterwheels are easy to use. Subsequently, key villages are selected, and detailed accounts are calculated for each farmer, helping farmers calculate that the grain increased in two seasons after the land is irrigated with waterwheels can recover the cost of the waterwheels. Farmers who know the benefits of waterwheels want to buy them, but it is necessary to further solve the farmers' financial and management difficulties. The best way to solve this problem is to combine with local cadres to organize "waterwheel mutual aid groups." Then, the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency lends waterwheels to the mutual aid groups. Then, farmers are required to pay in installments according to their economic situation. And help the mutual aid groups to establish reasonable methods for using and repairing waterwheels. At the same time, it also advocates that farmers jointly fund the purchase of waterwheels with cash, or that one household purchase them, and the water users give a certain depreciation fee for the waterwheels. By the end of 1949, there were more than 13,000 waterwheel mutual aid groups in North China. After the waterwheels are lent out, the recovery of the loans is also a meticulous organizational task. Cadres of the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency also have to go down to mobilize the farmers who borrowed waterwheels to repay the debts. Through the inspection and supervision of local district and village cadres, and at the same time, inspire farmers to have a good habit of keeping their promises, telling farmers that returning the waterwheel debts can produce more waterwheels and more grain can be produced nationwide. Commend those who pay well, criticize those who delay in paying, and inspire everyone to repay the loans.

　　After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the original Water Conservancy Promotion Agency of the North China People's Government was directly under the Ministry of Agriculture. In areas with waterwheel irrigation projects, water conservancy promotion agencies are established from provinces, special districts, to counties; villages establish water conservancy cooperative organizations that do not deviate from production, and are specifically responsible for the promotion of waterwheel wells. At present, Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Shanxi have formally established water conservancy promotion agencies. This year, the country plans to promote 111,500 new waterwheels, and the five provinces of North China plan to promote 80,000.

### 华北推广水井灌溉

　　华北推广水井灌溉
    萧颖
    华北一亩旱地常年平均产小麦一百一十斤，而一亩水地，平均常年可产小麦二百多斤，比旱地产量高出一倍以上。
    今年全国增产食粮一百亿斤，皮棉四亿五千万斤的计划中，保证增产的重要措施之一，就是要扩大八百五十万亩的灌溉面积。而在扩大的八百五十万亩灌溉面积中，又规定以推广水车井来完成二百七十七万亩。这是一个巨大的任务，需要增加新水车十一万一千五百辆，修复旧水车五万二千七百辆。水车井灌溉法是一种易于发展的小型灌溉事业，华北农村较普遍，尤其是河北，一省水车水井灌溉面积即达九百余万亩。
    华北农民利用水车井灌溉农田，在抗战以前已很发达。但在八年抗战及三年解放战争中，被敌伪破坏的很利害。据一九四八年京华北人民政府农业部调查：冀中、北岳区被敌伪填充破坏或因战事而损坏的水井占全区水井总数百分之十一·八，水车占全区水车总数百分之二十五·八。一九四七年华北各解放地区土地改革以后，农民生产情绪特别高涨，变旱地为水浇地成为翻身农民普遍的要求。于是，前晋察冀边区政府遂在一九四八年四月，成立了水利推进社，专门发展水车水井的灌溉事业。当时边区政府在财政非常困难的情形下，拨出二千九百九十二万斤小米专款经营此项事业。后华北人民政府成立，该社即成为全华北区的组织。该水利推进社成立后，一面扶植水车工厂生产，一面组织农民打井和贷购水车。两年来，该社共发动农民打新井七万九千四百八十八眼。贷出新水车一万三千零四十六辆。每眼水车井平均浇地二十五亩到三十亩，无车水井平均浇地三亩。每亩地平均可增产食粮八市斗。一九四九年华北水井灌溉的收益就达到粮食六千九百七十八万七千斤的巨大数量（只指新打的井收益）。
    水利推进社从采购水车原料，生产水车，到组织农民打井贷水车一系列的工作，都负责领导进行的。京津解放后，原华北政府水利推进社遂有计划的扶植公营和私营的水车工厂，供给各厂原料，收购他们的产品。目前水车工厂已发展到三百八十五个。水利推进社又统一指导了各厂生产技术。设计了新型水车。新型水车分两种：轻型的，适用于深水位，仅重六十九公斤；比旧型水车最轻的要轻七十一公斤。重型的，适用于浅水位，仅重七十六公斤；比旧型水车最轻的还轻六十四公斤。这样新型水车既省大量的铸铁，又减低了成本。过去一辆水车平均要一千三百多斤小米；新水车还不到一千斤，平均减低了一半。旧水车有十多种尺寸，大小都不相同，损坏了就很难添配零件。新水车都有一定的规格，零件损坏，说出式样随时可以更换。
    水利推进社同时掌握了更重要的把水车推广到农民手里。首先水利推进社派干部下乡，配合当地工作人员作广泛的宣传。利用集市、庙会贴广告、出墙报、作口头宣传。把水车按装在道边的井上，试验给农民看，让农民自己试验，使农民亲眼看到新水车好用。随后，再选出重点村，深入到各农户算细账，帮助农民算出装水车后，被灌溉的地两季增产的粮食，就可以收回水车的本钱。农民知道了水车好处就想买，但必需进一步解决农民资金和管理上的困难。解决这一问题的最好方法是，结合当地干部组织“水车互助组”。再由水利推进社贷给互助组水车。然后根据农民经济情况规定农民分期付款。并帮助互助组订立合理使用水车和修理水车的办法。同时也提倡各农户合资用现款购水车的互助组，或由一户购买，由用水户给以一定的水车的折旧费的互助办法。华北各地在一九四九年底已有一万三千多个水车互助组。水车出贷后，贷款的收回也是一件细致的组织工作。水利推进社干部也要下去发动贷水车的农户归还欠款。通过当地区村干部检查督促，同时再启发农民守信的优良作风，告诉农民交回水车欠款才能制造更多水车，才能全国多打粮食。表扬交款子好的，批评拖延不交的，启发大家归还贷款。
    中央人民政府成立后，原华北人民政府水利推进社即直辖于农业部。凡有水车灌溉事业的地区，从省、专区、到县都设水利推进社；村设不脱离生产的水利合作社的组织，专负水车井的推广工作。目前正式成立水利推进社的已有河北、平原、察哈尔及山西。全国今年计划推广十一万一千五百辆新水车，华北五省即计划推广八万辆。
