Strengthening Organizational Leadership, Deepening Mobilization
	Lanzhou Collects Nearly 90% of Last Winter's Taxes

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Gansu Daily on April 9th: Since the Lanzhou Municipal People's Government at all levels mobilized cadres, cleared up thinking, changed work styles, and strengthened collection of the 1949 winter business tax and income tax, nearly 90% of the total amount has been completed, and a small number of outstanding debts are being collected. Previously, due to insufficient attention to taxation by some leading departments and a lack of confidence in completing tasks among working comrades, coupled with a lack of clear understanding of taxation in their thinking, and insufficient specific and in-depth mobilization work, some industrial and commercial households evaded and delayed, generally shouting after receiving payment notices: "The deadline is too short, and turnover is impossible!" However, most industrial and commercial households paid as scheduled, such as the Siliang Shoe Store and Dafeng Store, which cleared their payments one or two days after receiving the notice; some industrial and commercial households remained hesitant and waited. In response to the above situation, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly reviewed the situation and redeployed, in addition to the tax bureau's working cadres, the city level also transferred cadres to participate in promoting tax collection work. The Municipal Committee transferred Organization Minister Luo Yangshi, United Front Work Department Deputy Minister Zhang Yousan, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Yutian, etc., as team leaders, a total of six teams, assigned to each district of the city to work in coordination; and instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau and its branches to closely cooperate in tax collection work, heighten vigilance, prevent sabotage by saboteurs, and promptly expose rumors. In the extensive and in-depth specific mobilization work, meetings of activists, meetings of tax collection cadres, and mobilization rallies of the industrial and commercial circles were held. Qiang Zixiu, secretary of the Municipal Committee, Li Jingting, deputy secretary, Wu Hongbin, mayor, and Sun Jianfeng, deputy mayor, all came to guide, enabling tax collection cadres and industrial and commercial activists to have a preliminary and clear understanding in their thinking. At the same time, four decisions were made to correct shortcomings. After the meeting, the industrial and commercial circles changed from hesitation and waiting, attempting to reduce or exempt taxes, to the practical action of actively paying taxes, so that the current payments totaled 949,461.72 real units. This accounts for nearly 90% of the taxable amount of 1.15 million real units. The proportion of payments is: the commercial sector accounts for more than 90% of the payable amount; the industrial sector accounts for more than 80%.

　　加强组织领导深入动员
    兰州去冬税收入库近九成
    【本报讯】据四月九日甘肃日报消息：兰州市一九四九年冬季营业税、所得税自市各级人民政府动员干部，搞通思想、转变作风、加强征收以来，目前已完成将近总额百分之九十，少数尾欠正在征收中。以前由于部分领导部门对税收重视不够，工作同志对完成任务没有信心，在思想上对税收也没有明确的认识，加之动员工作不够具体深入，部分工商业户，逃避拖延，一般于接到缴款书后，便叫喊：“限期短，周转不开！”但多数工商业户早已如期缴纳，如四良鞋店、大丰商店等，接到通知后一二日即缴清；部分工商业户仍犹豫观望。中共市委针对以上情况，及时加以检讨，并重新动员布置，除税局工作干部外，市级又抽调干部参加推进税收工作。市委会抽调组织部长罗杨实，统战部副部长张友三、副秘书长雷雨天等，分任组长，共六个组，分配全市各区，协同进行工作；并责成本市公安局及各分局在税收工作中，密切配合，提高警惕，防止破坏分子捣乱，及时揭破谣言。在广泛深入的进行具体动员工作中，曾召开积极分子会议，税收干部会议，和工商业界动员大会。市委书记强自修、副书记李景亭、市长吴鸿宾、副市长孙剑峰等均亲临指导，使税收干部、工商业积极分子，在思想上有了初步明确的认识。同时作出了四项改正缺点的决定。会后，工商界由犹豫观望、企图减免、等待，变为积极缴纳的实际行动，所以目前已缴纳入库者共九四九、四六一·七二折实单位。占应征额一一五万折实单位将近百分之九十。其中交款比例为：商业界约占应交款额百分之九十以上；工业界约占百分之八十以上。
