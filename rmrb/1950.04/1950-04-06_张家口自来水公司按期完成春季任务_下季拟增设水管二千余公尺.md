　　[Another report] Left Wanfang and Zheng Hongzhang, meter readers of Zhangjiakou City Water Company, completed their meter reading tasks five days ahead of schedule in March. Previously, when they inspected water meters, they were sloppy in their work, irresponsible, and made numerous mistakes, which affected the progress of billing work and caused business losses to the company. This year, due to the implementation of a responsibility system, division of labor by district, and the establishment of individual plans, they completed the inspection of 8,801 water meters in the city five days ahead of schedule in March, and only made two mistakes from January to March.

　　张家口自来水公司按期完成春季任务
    下季拟增设水管二千余公尺
    【本报讯】张家口市自来水公司由于全体职工努力，已如期完成今年第一季生产任务，在营业收支上亦逐渐趋向平衡。为协助工业建设之需及便利市民用水，该公司在第二季生产计划中，决定在各区分别增设不同口径干线水管二、二三四公尺，另外增设四水源量水器一部，消防栓六处及零星售水站二处。
                                                      （商养晦）
    【又讯】张家口市自来水公司查表员左万芳、郑鸿章三月份提前五天完成查表任务。以前他们在检查水表时，因工作马虎，不负责任，错误百出，以致影响收费工作的进行，造成公司业务损失。今年因实行负责制，按区分工，并订出个人计划，故三月份提前五天即完成全市八八一块水表的检查任务，且自一月份至三月份仅查错二次。
