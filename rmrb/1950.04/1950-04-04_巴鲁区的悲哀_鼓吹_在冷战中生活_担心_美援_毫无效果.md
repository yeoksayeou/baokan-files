Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Following Secretary of State Acheson's boasting of so-called "total diplomacy," American monopoly capitalists are using their spokespersons to advocate steps to materialize this fascist slogan. According to a March 31st dispatch from the Associated Press, former US presidential advisor Baruch, in a speech at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, clamored that so-called "total peace" must be conducted in the manner of "total war." Baruch made it clear that what he meant by "total peace" was to strengthen the "Cold War" against peace and democracy around the world. He said: "To win in the 'Cold War,' there must be a group that specializes in considering the 'Cold War,' planning the 'Cold War,' living in the 'Cold War,' and breathing the 'Cold War.'" Baruch believes that the fascist-like small cabinet currently existing in the United States—the National Security Council—has not played the role he had hoped for, so it must be "awakened." Baruch proposed that "someone like General Marshall" should be the head of this fascist clique, but he immediately exposed the weakness of his candidate. Baruch admitted that the United States had suffered a serious defeat in China, to the point that it "has caused open discussion of whether we have already failed in the 'Cold War.'" Elsewhere in his speech, Baruch could not hide the sorrow in his heart. He proposed that the French imperialist colonial war in Vietnam should be "successfully concluded," but Marshall's experience made him worry that American "aid" to France's military supplies would only result in "some careless and possibly ineffective actions."

### 巴鲁区的悲哀  鼓吹“在冷战中生活”  担心“美援”毫无效果

　　巴鲁区的悲哀
    鼓吹“在冷战中生活”
    担心“美援”毫无效果
    【新华社三日讯】继美国国务卿艾奇逊吹嘘所谓“总体外交”之后，美国独占资本家又通过其代言人鼓吹使这一法西斯口号具体化的步骤。据合众社三月三十一日电，美国前总统顾问巴鲁区在罗得岛新港海战学校演说时，叫嚣必须用进行“总体战”的方式进行所谓“总体和平”。巴鲁区表明他所说的“总体和平”，就是要在全世界加强反对和平与民主的“冷战”。他说：“要在‘冷战’中获胜，必须有一个集团，专门考虑‘冷战’，筹划‘冷战’，在‘冷战’中生活，并呼吸‘冷战’。”巴鲁区认为目前美国存在的法西斯性质的小内阁——国家安全委员会，还没有起如他所希望的作用，因此要使它“苏醒”。巴鲁区提出，要“马歇尔将军那样的人”来做这个法西斯小集团的头子，但是他马上暴露了他的候选人的软弱性。巴鲁区承认，美国在中国已遭到严重失败，以致“引起了我们是否已在‘冷战’中失败的公开讨论。”巴鲁区在其演说的其他地方，也掩盖不了他内心的悲哀。他提出要使法帝国主义在越南的殖民战争“胜利结束”，但马歇尔的经验又使他担心美国“援助”法国的军火，结果只是“一些漫不经心的还可能是毫无效果的行动”。
