　　Land Distributed, Good Rain Follows:
    Farmers in Beijing Suburbs Busily Sowing
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the spring rain that fell generally across the Beijing suburbs on the 15th and 16th of this month, farmers are overjoyed and busily sowing. Many elderly people say, "It is rare to have such heavy rain in the spring, which is excellent for wheat seedlings and green vegetables." In particular, the peasants who have been emancipated, having received land in the land reform last winter, now have even more confidence in increasing production by 10% this year with such good spring rain. Farmers in various districts are seizing the opportunity to launch a concentrated effort to sow large autumn crops. In the 20th district, out of the thirteen villages, more than 5,300 mu have been planted out of the 8,000 mu of land. Immediately after the rain, the Changxindian District formed two work teams to go to the countryside to organize the masses to weed the wheat seedlings, cultivate the land, and prepare for sowing. The spring rain is also beneficial to the newly planted trees. The more than 2,000 elm and willow trees planted by the farmers in the 20th district this year, and the more than 700 grafted flower and fruit trees, have all sprouted leaves and branches.

　　分得土地又落了好雨
    京郊农民紧张播种
    【本报讯】京郊于本月十五、十六两日普降春雨后，农民欢天喜地，紧张播种。很多老年人都说：“历来春季很少下过这样大的雨，这对麦苗、青菜真是太好了。”特别是翻身后的农民，在去冬土改中分了地，现在又落了这样好的春雨，对今年增产一成更有了信心。各区农民正抓紧时机突击播种大秋作物。二十区十三个村的八千多亩地已种上五千三百多亩。长辛店区在雨后即组成两个工作组，下乡组织群众锄麦苗、耕地，准备播种。春雨对新栽的树木也有好处，二十区农民今年栽植的两千多棵榆、柳树，接木的七百多棵花果树，都已吐叶生枝了。（二十区杨德民、长辛店区谭桂成）
