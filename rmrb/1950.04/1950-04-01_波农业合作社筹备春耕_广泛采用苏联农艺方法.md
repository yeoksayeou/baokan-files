The Zsavenko Cooperative, thanks to the educational work and practical assistance of scientific workers and students from Wrocław University, will widely adopt Soviet agronomic methods this year. The Bpszunno Cooperative in the Świdnicki District is formulating an experimental plan. Scientific workers from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Wrocław University are helping local inventors design new potato planters. Recently, at the initiative of the Committee for Cooperation between Scientific Workers and Farmers, a conference was held in Wrocław, where several professors lectured on modern Soviet agricultural biology based on the Michurin Doctrine. The audience all pledged to improve the work of state-owned farms.
