Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 15th Tass: Newspapers here report that the movement of Indian workers and peasants demanding peace, democracy, and land is generally surging. 1,800 workers at the Kanpur Electricity Plant went on strike to protest the police's arrest of Patnaik, chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress United Provinces Branch, and eight other trade union personnel at the request of union splittists—the so-called leaders of the Indian National Trade Union Congress. Although several suppression teams of the police bureau tried to suppress it, under the staunch resistance of the workers of the Kanpur factory, the government was finally forced to release the arrested trade union personnel.
    According to news from Mainpuri District, United Provinces: Farmers in Kosma Village there recently held a huge demonstration. The demonstrators, holding red flags, demanded the liquidation of the feudal land ownership system, a reduction in taxes levied on farmers, an increase in wages for agricultural workers, and an end to anti-people suppression. The demonstrators demanded that residents unite! Struggle to support peace and oppose the American and British war-mongers and their allies in India.
    A large-scale demonstration was held in Muzaffarabad, northern Kashmir, to protest anti-democratic suppression. Women and students walked at the head of the demonstration. The demonstrators demanded that India withdraw from the British Empire, that India achieve true independence, and that American and British warmongers not be allowed to interfere in India's internal affairs. The demonstrators cheered the Soviet Union, the powerful fortress of peace and democracy in the world. The police dispersed the demonstration and arrested eight people.
    In view of the fact that more than 20 million residents in the eastern region of the United Provinces are facing the threat of starvation, the Farmers' Association Committee urged farmers, workers, and intellectuals to organize conferences and demonstrations, demanding that the Indian government immediately assist the farmers and exempt farmers in disaster areas from rent and taxes.

　　印度工人农民争和平  反剥削运动普遍高涨
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社德里十五日讯：此间报纸报道，印度工人与农民要求和平、民主与土地的运动，普遍高涨。坎伯电力厂一千八百名工人举行罢工，抗议警察应工会分裂分子——所谓印度全国职工大会的首领们——的要求，逮捕全印总工会联合省分会主席伯特纳克及其他八个工会人员。虽然警察局的若干弹压队力图镇压，但在坎伯厂工人们的顽强抵抗下，政府终于迫不得已释放了被捕的工会人员。
    据来自联合省梅英浦利区的消息：该地科斯麦村的农民最近曾举行了巨大的示威游行。示威者们举着红旗，要求清算封建土地所有制，减少向农民征收的捐税，增加农业工人的工资，并停止反人民的镇压行为。示威者要求居民们团结起来！为拥护和平、反对美英战争贩子及其在印度的同盟者而斗争。
    喀什米尔北部的慕沙发浦曾举行了大规模的示威，抗议反民主的镇压手段。妇女和学生走在示威队伍的前列。示威者要求印度退出不列颠帝国，印度真正独立，和不许英美战争贩子干涉印度内政。示威者曾向全世界和平民主的强有力的堡垒——苏联欢呼。警察打散了示威行列，并逮捕了八个人。
    农民协会委员会鉴于联合省东部地区两千万以上的居民面临着饿死的威胁，力促农民、工人和知识分子组织大会和示威，要求印度政府立即援救农民，和免除灾区农民的租税。
