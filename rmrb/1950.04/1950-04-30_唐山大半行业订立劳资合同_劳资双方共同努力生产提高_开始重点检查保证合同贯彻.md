Tangshan Most Industries Sign Labor-Capital Contracts
	Labor and Capital Work Together to Improve Production
	Key Inspections Begin to Ensure Contract Implementation
	[Our Newspaper] Tangshan City has thirty-five industries that have formally signed labor-capital collective contracts, or have reached agreements, these industries account for fifty-three percent of the total industries. In order to ensure that the signed contracts can be correctly implemented, the Tangshan City Labor Bureau has cooperated with the Industry Trade Union Federation and the Shop Employee Trade Union Federation to start key inspections. The city began to sign labor-capital collective contracts in October last year. The Labor Bureau extensively convened symposiums for both labor and capital representatives from various industries; the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions successively trained trade union group leaders and trade union members from various industries. After repeated publicity and education, a surge of contract signing was launched. After the contracts were signed, the workers' labor discipline was generally strengthened, and production efficiency significantly improved. For example, the ceramics industry contract stipulated a piece-rate wage system with more pay for more work, and the production rate generally increased by 20% to 30%. In order to help some industries with practical difficulties to overcome their problems, many workers voluntarily reduced their wages, or adopted the method of taking turns living at home to reduce factory expenses, fully demonstrating the great spirit of the working class. Under the influence of the workers, the confidence of the capitalists in managing production has also increased. The Fuxingcheng Machine Iron Factory actively sought business and expanded its production scope, hiring more than twenty temporary workers. Some capitalists have increased their capital. After the general factories signed contracts, the factory side began to change its attitude towards the workers, consulting with employees on matters: and making appropriate reforms to some unreasonable systems.
	On the other hand, the phenomenon of the capital side not fulfilling the agreement, procrastinating and prevaricating, and the labor side violating labor discipline still exists in a few factories. Some capitalists look for various excuses to prevent workers from holding meetings; some deliberately complain endlessly, attempting to evade taxes and public bonds; and some try every means to reduce business, attempting to lay off employees. In order to change these situations, the city's Labor Bureau, in conjunction with the Small and Medium Industry Trade Union Federation and the Shop Employee Trade Union Federation, has begun to inspect the implementation of collective contracts in the machine iron, hardware, and catering industries, in order to correct deviations in a timely manner and promote the efficiency of the contracts. The inspection method is: first, the labor and capital sides hold various meetings separately for extensive discussion. Both sides write opinions, exchange them, study them separately, and then formally hold meetings for consultation. This method has been warmly embraced by both sides.

　　唐山大半行业订立劳资合同
    劳资双方共同努力生产提高
    开始重点检查保证合同贯彻
    【本报讯】唐山市已有三十五个行业正式签订营资集体合同，或已达成协议，这些行业占总行业的百分之五十三。为保证已签订的合同能正确执行，唐山市劳动局已协同行业工会联合会、店员工会联合会开始重点检查。该市于去年十月开始订立劳资集体合同。劳动局曾广泛召集各行业劳资双方开座谈会；市总工会先后轮训了各行业工会组长和工会委员。经过反复宣传教育后，即掀起订合同的热潮。合同立订后，工人的劳动纪律，普遍加强了，生产效率显著提高。如陶磁业合同中规定了多劳多酬的计件工资制，生产率一般提高了百分之二十至三十。为帮助某些有实际困难的行业渡过难关，不少工友自动减低工资，或采取轮流住家减少厂方开支的办法，充分表现了工人阶级的伟大气魄。在工人影响之下，资方经营生产的信心也增强了，复兴成机器铁工厂积极招揽生意，生产范围扩大，已增雇了二十多个临时工。有些资本家增加了资金。一般工厂订立合同后，厂方开始转变了对工人的态度，有事和职工商量：对一些不合理制度也作了适当改革。
    另一方面，资方不履行协议、推拖敷衍，劳方远反劳动纪律的现象，在少数工厂中仍然存在。有些资本家寻找各种借口，阻挡工人开会；有的故意叫苦连天，企图逃避税收和公债；有的则千方百计缩小营业，企图解雇职工。为了改变这些情况，该市劳动局协同中小行业工会联合会、店员工会联合会，开始检查机铁、五金和饭业三个行业集体合同的执行情形，以便及时纠正偏向，推进合同的效率。检查的方法是：首先由劳资双方分别召开各种会议，广泛讨论。双方写成意见书，互相交换，分别研究，再正式开会协商。这一办法已得到双方的热烈拥护。
