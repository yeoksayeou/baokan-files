    Wuhan's First Quarter Regular Tax Revenue Exceeds Target
    Refuting the View that "February and March are Slow Tax Months"
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 24th) Wuhan City has already overfulfilled its regular tax revenue task for the first quarter (January, February, and March). The original task assigned to Wuhan City by the Central South District Tax Bureau was 122,422,650 *jin* of cooked rice calculated by rice value, but the actual amount deposited was 125,816,569 *jin* of rice, exceeding the original task by slightly more than 2.7 percent. The main reason for this tax revenue exceeding the target this time is that the responsible personnel in the city strengthened their leadership over tax work. Wu Defeng, Mayor of Wuhan City People's Government, Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Lin Jinzhang, Director of the Central South District Tax Bureau, personally explained to the tax work cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Tax Bureau the important role of tax work in overcoming the country's financial difficulties, thus inspiring a high degree of work enthusiasm among the tax cadres. During the collection process, the tax cadres used their past experience in auditing accounts and continued to conduct strict inspections of goods tax, temporary business tax, stamp tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes, exposing and correcting various fraudulent tax evasion behaviors of some merchants, such as inconsistent goods and accounts, inconsistent goods and invoices, issuing fake invoices, and using one invoice for multiple purposes. The overfulfillment of the regular tax revenue task in the first quarter has proven that the view of general tax workers that February and March are "slow months" for tax revenue is incorrect, thus further strengthening their confidence in tax work. The city's tax bureau is calling on all tax personnel to continue to work hard to improve their work in order to ensure the victorious completion of the second quarter's tax task.

　　武汉首季经常税收超额完成
    打破了“二三月是税收淡月”的观点
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】武汉市第一季（一、二、三月份）经常税收任务，已经超额完成。中南区税务管理局原来分配给武汉市的任务是一亿二千二百四十二万二千六百五十斤元熟米，现在实际入库数字为大米一亿二千五百八十一万六千五百六十九斤，已超过原定任务百分之二点七强。这次税收所以能够超额完成任务，主要是由于该市负责人员加强了对税收工作的领导，武汉市人民政府吴德峰市长、中共武汉市委书记张平化、中南区税务管理局长林锦章等都曾亲自向武汉市税务局税收工作干部解释了税收工作对克服国家财政困难的重要作用，因而启发了税务干部高度的工作积极性。征收过程中，税务干部运用了过去查账的经验，继续对货物税、临时商业税、印花税、屠宰税等进行了严格的检查，揭发和纠正了部分商人的货账不符、货票不符、开假发票、一票数用等种种舞弊逃税行为。第一季经常税收任务的超额完成，已经证明了一般税务工作人员所谓二、三月份是税收“淡月”的观点是不对的，因而更加加强了他们对于税收工作的信心。该市税务局，正号召全局税务人员继续努力改进工作，以保证第二季税收任务的胜利完成。
