Ministry of Agriculture's Water Conservancy Promotion Society
Actively Promotes the Lending of Water Wheels
Hebei and Four Other Provinces Have Produced 29,000 Water Wheels, Lending Out Over 10,000.
[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Our newspaper's special correspondent, Li Ziliang, reports: The Ministry of Agriculture's Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Central People's Government is actively promoting the lending of water wheels to support small and medium-sized rural water conservancy projects. This year, the society originally planned to lend out 80,000 water wheels in the North China provinces (mostly produced by the provincial water conservancy promotion societies). Over the past three months, Hebei, Chahar, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces have produced 29,281 water wheels. As of the end of March, 10,597 water wheels have been lent out in these four provinces. The Water Conservancy Promotion Society plans to lend out a total of 66,100 water wheels by the end of June, completing 80% of the annual task; the remaining 10,000-plus water wheels will be lent out before the autumn wheat planting season.

Completing the production of over 29,000 water wheels involved a difficult and arduous process. At the beginning of the work, the cadres of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society harbored the idea of "doing as much as the money allows," requesting additional budget. However, the budget could not be increased, nor could the task be reduced. In this situation, it was necessary to reverse the mentality of relying on superiors for money, conduct careful calculations, rationally allocate funds, and determine the tasks for each province. The provincial water conservancy promotion societies also implemented the spirit of careful calculation, processing non-water wheel raw materials, collecting waste materials to save funds, reducing costs, and producing more low-cost water wheels. They also increased the rate of capital turnover, striving to recover cash when lending, and setting recovery targets based on different regions, aiming to recover one-fourth of the cash at the provincial level. In production, they initially experimented with division of labor to increase production speed. Raw material procurement adopted a unified procurement method to avoid affecting market fluctuations. However, in procurement, due to the cadres' lack of experience, some of the purchased raw materials were not suitable, occupying a portion of the funds. In addition, the failure to establish warehouses in a timely manner affected the storage of raw materials. Furthermore, in the initial experiment of division of labor, the specifications and sizes of the semi-finished products were not completely consistent, which restricted assembly. The Water Conservancy Promotion Society is intensifying efforts to improve these shortcomings.

    积极开展出贷水车工作         
    河北等四省已生产水车二万九千辆，贷出万余辆。
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员李子良报导：中央人民政府农业部水利推进社积极开展出贷水车工作，扶助农村中小型水利。该社本年原计划在华北各省贷出水车八万辆（大部分由各省水利推进社组织生产）。三个月来，河北、察哈尔、平原、山西等四省已生产水车二万九千二百八十一辆；迄三月底，在该四省已贷出水车一万零五百九十七辆。水利推进社准备在六月底以前，共贷出六万六千一百辆水车，即完成全年任务的百分之八十；其余一万多辆，将在秋后种麦前全部贷出。
    完成二万九千余辆水车生产，是经过了艰苦、困难过程的。工作开始，水利推进社干部存在了“给多少钱，办多少事”的思想，要求追加预算。但预算不能加，任务也不能减少。在这样情况下，只有扭转向上级要钱的依赖思想，进行精打细算，合理分配资金，确定各省任务。各省水利推进社也贯彻精打细算精神，处理非水车原料，搜集废料节省资金，减低成本，多生产成本低的水车。并增加资金周转率，在出贷时，争取收回现款，分别不同地区，确定收回现款要求，以省为单位达到收回现款四分之一。在生产中，初步试验了分工生产，以提高生产速度。原料采购则采取了统一采购办法，以免影响市场波动。但在采购中，由于干部业务不熟练，采购来的原料，有的不适用，占去了一部分资金。加以仓库未及时建立，使原料保管受到影响。此外，在初步试验分工生产中，生产出来的半成品，规格尺子还不完全一致，在装配上受到限制。以上缺点，水利推进社正在加紧改进。
