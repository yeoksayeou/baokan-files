Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 24th: The Northwest Public Security Conference concluded on April 15th after lasting thirteen days. The conference reported on and exchanged experiences regarding public security work since May of last year and formulated the key tasks for 1950.

　　Northwest public security work has basically completed the tasks of suppressing bandits and cracking down on special agents, establishing the necessary conditions for mobilizing the masses to carry out democratic reforms in urban and rural areas. According to incomplete statistics: 58 cases (stations, groups) of lurking special agents and 6 newly dispatched groups were uncovered, a number of special agent lurking radio stations were seized, 205 general special agent organizations (stations, offices, groups) were destroyed, more than 9,000 special agent elements were dealt with separately, and more than 10,000 enemy party and league members were registered. Key special agent elements and counter-revolutionary elements have been subjected to detention and education. In terms of eliminating bandits and reactionary armed forces, 542 robbery cases were solved, more than 1,900 scattered bandits were captured or won over, more than 7,300 firearms were seized, and more than 20 cases of riots and assassinations were cracked. The conference pointed out that we must not be satisfied with these achievements. The enemy is still making a desperate struggle, so we must be extremely vigilant and vigorously strengthen the struggle against hidden enemies.

　　Regarding the future struggle against special agents, the conference pointed out that specialized organs should be combined with the broad masses, policies and enemy situations should be grasped concretely, and hidden enemies should be thoroughly eliminated with a serious and cautious attitude. We must oppose liberalism and careless work styles in the struggle against the enemy. In mines, factories, transportation, and enterprises, security organizations and various safety systems must be established on the basis of mobilizing the masses to carry out mass factory protection movements against special agents in order to protect production and construction. The conference stipulated that the focus of public security work in the Northwest in 1950 is to continue to complete the registration of Kuomintang, Three People's Principles Youth League, and special agent elements, improve urban management, continue to mobilize the masses in rural areas, and in conjunction with the army, eliminate bandits and sabotage elements hiding in rural areas, maintain social order, and consolidate the revolutionary order.

　　西北举行公安会议
    强调结合广大群众肃清隐蔽敌人
    【本报讯】据新华社西安二十四日电：西北公安会议历时十三天，已于四月十五日结束。会议对去年五月迄今的公安工作进行了汇报并交流了经验，制定了一九五○年的工作重点。
    西北公安工作基本上完成了清剿土匪、打击特务的任务。为发动群众进行城乡民主改革建立了必要条件。据不完全统计：破获潜伏特务案五十八件（站、组）及新派遣的六个组，缴特务潜伏电台若干部，摧毁一般特务组织二百零五件（站、室、组），分别处理了九千多名特务分子，登记敌党团分子一万余人，首要特务分子及反革命分子则已予以管训教育。在肃清土匪与反动武装方面，破获抢劫案五百四十二件，捕获与争取散匪一千九百余人，收缴枪枝七千三百余枝，并破获暴动暗杀案二十余件。会议指出：对于这些成绩绝不能表示满足。敌人还在作垂死挣扎，因此必须万分警惕，大力加强对暗藏敌人的斗争。
    关于今后反对特务的斗争问题，会议指出：应使专门机关与广大群众相结合，要具体的掌握政策与敌情，以严肃慎重的态度，彻底肃清隐蔽敌人。反对对敌斗争中的自由主义及粗枝大叶的工作作风。在矿山、工厂、交通及企业部门，必须在发动群众进行反对特务斗争的群众护厂运动基础上，建立保卫组织和各种安全制度，以保卫生产建设。会议规定：一九五○年西北公安工作的重点，是继续完成对国民党、三青团和特务分子的登记工作，健全城市管理，在农村中继续发动群众，结合军队，肃清土匪及隐藏在农村中的破坏分子，维护社会治安，巩固革命秩序。
