Peking University Prepares to Commemorate Youth Day with Various Academic Soirees

[Reported by this newspaper] "May Fourth" is Youth Day and also the alumni homecoming day for Peking University. To celebrate this meaningful dual holiday, the university committee, trade union, and student union have each appointed three representatives to form the May Fourth Commemoration Preparatory Committee. It has been decided that in addition to holding various commemorative activities on "May Fourth," various academic soirees will be held around "May Fourth," hosted by the relevant department heads and department associations. Currently, the confirmed events include an economics soiree on May 2nd, a science soiree and a history soiree on May 3rd, and an arts and literature soiree on May 5th. From May 4th to May 7th, a science exhibition will be held at the Second College of Science and Engineering. At the same time, the studios of martyr Li Dazhao and Chairman Mao at Peking University during the "May Fourth" era will be opened, and people from outside the university will be invited to visit. The Peking University Weekly will publish a commemorative special issue on "May Fourth," and the student union will also produce a commemorative wall poster.

In addition, the historical materials that Peking University was entrusted to assist in collecting for the "History of the Youth Movement since the May Fourth Movement" exhibition organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation have now been submitted, including various photographs, newspapers, magazines, and mimeographed materials.
