　　Grain Thefts Occur Continuously in Grain Depots of Some Counties and Villages in Changzhi Region; Overcome Complacency and Improve Grain Depot Equipment

　　[Our Dispatch] In some counties and districts of the Changzhi region, grain thefts have occurred continuously in grain depots because management cadres are unfamiliar with their duties and are careless in safekeeping; and because higher authorities required centralized storage on the basis of decentralized storage, hastily applying poorly constructed grain depots. For example, the cadre in charge of the Licuan temporary grain depot in Jincheng County was ideologically complacent and did not pay attention to theft prevention. On the third night of the first lunar month, thieves twisted open the doors and windows of the grain depot and stole about a thousand catties of public grain, but this was not discovered until the fifth day of the first lunar month. The Yaoshang warehouse under the jurisdiction of the Citian Town temporary grain depot in Xiangyuan County had been stolen from twice. Later, in February, Ma Zhezhen of the village dug a hole under the wall of the warehouse and entered the warehouse, stealing more than two hundred catties of public grain. In December of last year, two theft cases occurred in the branch depots of Gaoping County: Bi Caiwang and Guo Quanyan stole 360 catties of wheat from the Fengzhuang temporary depot; 135 catties of wheat were stolen from the Mishan local depot. After the grain depot theft case occurred, the Seventh District Office of Jincheng County conscientiously led cadres to conduct inspections and investigations, and found that Chen Yukui and Pang Erman of the village had stolen 678 and a half catties of public grain. The two criminals have now been sent to the County People's Government for investigation. The thieves in Xiangyuan and Gaoping counties have also been captured and sent to the respective County People's Governments for handling. The reason for the grain depot thefts in various counties is that cadres were negligent in managing grain depot work, did not actively think of ways to improve grain depot equipment, and were ideologically complacent. After this lesson, all localities should be vigilant to strengthen safekeeping work and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. Furthermore, the cadres of the Seventh District Office of Jincheng and other agencies actively and conscientiously carried out inspections, cracked the theft case, and reduced the country's financial losses, which should be emulated by all localities.

　　长治专区部分县村粮库连续发生盗粮事件
    应克服麻痹思想改进粮库设备
    【本报讯】长治专区部分县区粮库，因管理干部业务生疏，保管不慎；以及因上级要求在分散保管的粮库基础上集中保管，迁就应用建造简陋的粮库，致连续发生公粮被盗情形。如晋城县犁川代库干部思想麻痹，不注意防盗，粮库于阴历正月初三夜间，被小偷扭开门窗偷去公粮约千余斤，且至正月初五日方发现。襄垣县虒亭镇代库所辖窑上库房曾两次被盗，后于二月间又被该村名马哲贞者在库房墙下挖洞进入仓内，盗去公粮二百余斤。高平县分库在去年十二月份发生盗案两件：奉庄代库被毕才旺、郭全眼二人偷去麦子三百六十斤；米山地方库被盗去麦子一百三十五斤。晋城县七区公所于该县粮库盗案发生后，认真领导干部进行检查侦缉，查出公粮米六百七十八斤半被该村陈裕魁、庞二满二人所盗，现已将二犯送该县人民政府查办。其他襄垣、高平二县偷盗犯亦经查获，送各该县人民政府处理。各县粮库被盗原因，均为干部疏忽保管粮库工作，不积极想法改进粮库设备，思想麻痹所致。经此次教训后，各地均应引起警惕，以加强保管工作，保证不致再有类似事件发生。又晋城七区公所等机关干部，积极认真进行稽查，破获盗案，减少国家财政损失，应为各地效法。（李子清）
