　　War-Monger Dulles Plots to Conclude a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch] War-monger Dulles, after becoming a senior advisor to Acheson, is actively planning the scheme of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan. According to news from American and British news agencies: Dulles declared to reporters on the 8th that his new position "focuses on Far Eastern policy," and said, "The Far East is where we have the most to do." The US government stated the day after announcing Dulles's appointment that "there will be much greater progress than before in drafting a peace treaty with Japan in the near future." Acheson also announced his intention to give Dulles preparation for "the topic of a separate peace treaty with Japan" the "highest priority." At the same time, Assistant Secretary of State Butterworth, "who specializes in Japanese affairs," was ordered by Acheson on the 7th to immediately go to New York to hold meetings with Dulles to discuss how to "take the initiative to promote the signing of a peace treaty with Japan," and this meeting "is considered particularly important because it indicates a serious effort to extend bipartisan cooperation to the Far East."
    Dulles's earliest activities after taking office, combined with Butterworth's transfer on March 27, show that the US government is stepping up its activities to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan in order to turn Japan back into a base for aggressive war.

　　战贩杜勒斯谋策划单独对日缔和
    【新华社十三日讯】战贩杜勒斯就任艾奇逊高级顾问后，积极筹划单独缔结对日和约的勾当。据美英通讯社消息：杜勒斯于八日对记者宣称，他的新职务“着重点是在远东政策上”，并说，“远东是我们有最多事情做的地方”。美国官方于宣布杜勒斯任命的次日即表示，“最近将来在拟订对日和约草案方面，能有比以前大得多的进展”。艾奇逊并宣布打算给杜勒斯准备单独对日缔结和约“这一题目以最高优先权”。同时，“专门处理日本事务”的助理国务卿白德华，已于七日奉艾奇逊之命立即前往纽约，与杜勒斯举行会议，商讨如何“采取主动力促签订对日和约”，而这次会议并“被认为特别重要，因为它指明认真地要把两党合作伸展到远东来”。
    杜勒斯就任后最先的活动与三月二十七日白德华的调职，显示美国政府正在加紧进行单独缔结对日和约的活动，以便将日本重新变为侵略战争的基地。
