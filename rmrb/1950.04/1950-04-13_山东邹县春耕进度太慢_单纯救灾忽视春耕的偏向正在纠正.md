　　Slow Spring Planting Progress in Zou County, Shandong
    The Tendency to Focus Solely on Disaster Relief and Neglect Spring Planting is Being Corrected
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Zhou Huanguang reports: Spring planting progress in Zou County, Shandong is too slow. The CPC County Committee has put forward specific requirements for planting sorghum around Qingming Festival and millet around Guyu Festival. The county has a total of 340,000 mu of spring land, of which only 59,753 mu were ploughed last winter. The county has 4,500 teams of oxen, and all the spring land needs 40 days to plough, including the continuous rainy days. Although many villages are currently engaged in spring planting, as of around March 20th, only more than 62,000 mu have been ploughed, accounting for only one-fifth of the spring land. Not all oxen teams in the county have been put into spring planting. The main reasons are: all cadres have the idea of emphasizing disaster relief and neglecting spring planting, believing that the disaster situation is not yet stable, the responsibility for disaster relief is serious, and it does not matter if the land is cultivated early or late. In addition, the failure to promptly correct violations of policies and infringement of the interests of middle peasants has reduced the enthusiasm of middle peasants for production, and they dare not boldly apply fertilizer to cultivate the land. In order to strive to complete spring planting on time and plant sorghum around Qingming and millet around Guyu, the CPC County Committee has put forward the following requirements: First, clarify that the current focus is on spring planting, closely combined with disaster relief. Light disaster areas should fully focus on spring planting, while heavy disaster areas should focus on both spring planting and disaster relief. This requires a lot of specific work, such as holding various meetings to deeply mobilize spring planting, earnestly correcting policies, dispelling the concerns of middle peasants about production, and mobilizing all livestock to participate in spring planting, etc. Secondly, promptly distribute seed loans and vegetable seeds, and thoroughly understand the people's seed preparation situation. Correctly carry out mutual assistance movements, and organize the masses to combine spring planting with sideline production to solve the difficulties of food and seeds for spring planting.

　　山东邹县春耕进度太慢
    单纯救灾忽视春耕的偏向正在纠正
    【本报讯】通讯员周焕光报导：山东邹县春耕进度太慢，中共县委提出实现清明种高粱、谷雨种谷子具体要求。该县全县共有春地三十四万亩，去年冬耕的仅五万九千七百五十三亩。全县牛犋四千五百犋，连阴雨在内全部春地要四十天耕完。目前虽有很多村庄进行春耕，但至三月二十号左右，还只耕了六万二千多亩，只占春地的五分之一，全县牛犋也没有全部投入春耕。主要原因是：全体干部存在了重救灾轻春耕的思想，认为灾情还不稳定，救灾责任严重，耕地早天晚天不要紧。另外是违反政策、侵犯中农利益未能及时纠正，因此减低中农生产积极性，不敢大胆施肥耕地。为了争取按时完成春耕，实现清明前后种上高粱、谷雨前后种上谷子，中共县委特提以下要求：首先明确当前以春耕为主，紧紧结合救灾，轻灾区全力突击春耕，重灾区春耕救灾并重。这样就要作很多具体工作，如召开各种会议进行深入动员春耕春种，认真端正政策，解除中农生产顾虑，动员全部畜力投入春耕等等。其次迅速发放贷种、菜种，并深入了解群众种籽准备情形。正确的开展互济运动，组织群众春耕结合副业生产，以解决春耕口粮种子困难。
