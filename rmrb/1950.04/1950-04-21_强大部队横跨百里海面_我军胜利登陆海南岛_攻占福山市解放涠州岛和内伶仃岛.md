Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 20th. The great campaign to liberate Hainan Island has victoriously begun. The powerful sea-crossing troops of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army have crossed over a hundred li of sea and made a pre-emptive landing on the northern coast of Qiong (Hainan Island). Two detachments of the People's Liberation Army's sea-crossing forces set out from the southern tip of the Leizhou Peninsula at 19:30 on the 16th, aboard various types of vessels, arranged in a majestic battle formation, like countless spearheads pointing directly at Qiongya (Hainan). On the way, our army engaged in a naval gun battle with the enemy all night, breaking through the enemy's layers of land, sea, and air three-dimensional defense network. After a voyage of one hundred and eighty li, they victoriously landed at the northeast of Lingao Cape, Bopu in Lingao County, Linshigang, and Shengyanshan in the north of Chengmai County, respectively, across a fifteen li wide cross-section area of northern Qiong at 3:00 on the 17th. The landing troops crushed the enemy's defense line in northern Qiong. In the battle, the majority of the directly subordinate units of the 391st Regiment of the 131st Division of the 64th Army, which defended the Lingao line, were annihilated, and the 392nd Regiment of the 131st Division was defeated in the Yuelang (west of Lingao) area. At the same time, another unit of the People's Liberation Army, which landed in northern Qiong, defeated two regiments of the enemy's Provisional 13th Division that were transported by car from Haikou to Fushan City (southeast of Lingao) during the movement, and captured Fushan City in one fell swoop.

Before this large-scale forced landing, the People's Liberation Army had conducted two rounds of four batches of covert crossings in early and late March. Simultaneously with the covert crossing of Qiongya, the People's Liberation Army captured Weizhou Island on March 7th.

According to preliminary statistics, the results of the People's Liberation Army's three landing operations are as follows: Capturing Xie Ruilin, the regimental commander of the 1st Regiment of the 2nd Training Division (who later escaped), Wang Ren, the deputy regimental commander, Zhang Yunhan, the deputy regimental commander of the 763rd Regiment of the 255th Division, Gan Zongzheng, the senior colonel staff officer of the South Route Bandit Suppression Command, Zhong Qingbang, the senior colonel political work director, and more than 2,000 other enemy personnel; killing and wounding more than 200 enemy personnel, including Shi Jian, the deputy regimental commander of the 1st Regiment of the 2nd Training Division. Captured four field guns, six infantry guns, two mortars, five 60mm mortars, twenty-five heavy machine guns, ninety-six light machine guns, eleven anti-aircraft machine guns, eight hundred and fifteen rifles and pistols, and more than 126,300 rounds of ammunition. In addition, an enemy plane was shot down on Leigong Island (north of Chengmai), and an enemy warship was damaged west of Lingao.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army liberated Nei Lingding Island, outside the Pearl River Estuary, on the 18th. The People's Liberation Army forcibly crossed the Nei Lingding Strait to land on Nei Lingding Island at 7:00 AM on the 18th, and victoriously concluded the battle by 10:00 AM, completely liberating Nei Lingding Island. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.
