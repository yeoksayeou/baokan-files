　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th—The People's Liberation Army Central South Military Region and the various organs and troops of the Fourth Field Army have actively launched work to reorganize their establishments and inventory their warehouses, striving to complete all tasks before the end of May. At the same time, all units are thoroughly mobilizing all commanders and fighters to conscientiously practice thrift and oppose corruption and waste.

　　In implementing the various specific measures of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army Senior Cadre Meeting regarding the implementation of the unified financial and economic work decision, all departments have separately organized inventory committees to check warehouse materials and submit them level by level; they have conducted strict audits and inspections of various expenses and grain accounts, and have established various systems such as periodic inspections, registration, settlement, and public announcement. A certain unit stipulates that material inventory is conducted once a month, and each mess unit settles accounts weekly. A certain bandit suppression unit in southern Hunan has also organized inspection teams to conduct inspections from top to bottom in order to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Some units, in order to educate supply and storage personnel, have implemented review and rotational training methods to improve the political quality and work ability of cadres.
