　　Guaranteeing Increased Grain Production
    ——A Record of the Opening and Repair of the Tiangang Village Canal
    By Our Correspondent Yao Fu
    On the fifth day after the Spring Festival, the newly opened canal in Tiangang Village, Fourth District, Yi County, was completed. Looking out from the small hill behind the village, the small plain south of the village is covered with canals of all sizes, both vertical and horizontal. In this beautiful and picturesque land, the peasants, working selflessly, all have smiles on their faces, reflecting the joy of early spring.
            (I)
    Tiangang is a village in the old liberated area. It was the most solid base area when the War of Resistance Against Japan began, and suffered greatly from enemy burning and killing. But it staunchly survived these most difficult years. In the winter of 1947, the land reform was completely finished, and every family had irrigated land. Because the whole village universally organized labor mutual aid, some of the difficulties encountered in irrigating the land were solved, and production was able to increase year by year. However, a new problem arose. In recent years, the riverbed has dropped, and the well water has also decreased year by year, which is not enough to use. Irrigation is intermittent, time-consuming, and laborious. If this continues, the irrigated land will slowly become dry land.
            (II)
    After the victory of the war, the demand for increased production inspired every farmer. At the village production meeting held in the district in January this year, the district head said: "The most important thing for our old liberated areas is to develop water conservancy and increase grain production, increasing agricultural production by 10% compared with 1949, and strive to restore it to pre-war levels." After this meeting, the Tiangang Village Communist Party branch specifically discussed how to increase production. The old problem that had been brewing for several years was raised again – let's open a new canal! But no one was sure. Some said, "If we dig for a long time and the water doesn't flow down, wouldn't it be a waste of effort?" Some said, "Taking private land for the sake of the whole village, people will be of different minds, who will take care of the mess?" There were also individual backward people who believed that opening a canal would "destroy the feng shui". But after talking it over, everyone slowly came to realize that as long as everyone is of one mind, plans well, and has strong leadership, it can be successful.
    On the sixteenth day of the lunar twelfth month, the first mobilization meeting of the whole village was held. After Secretary Hao Luoshi conveyed the spirit of the district production meeting and the branch's suggestions, he said, "This year, it would be best to achieve 'three nots' during the Spring Festival: no building sheds to perform operas; no aimless visiting of relatives; no idle wandering. It will be more energetic to use the New Year's steamed buns and sticky cakes to work.” Yu Youpeng, deputy instructor of the central village militia and education committee member, assured everyone that he would borrow sledgehammers, iron shovels, and steel drills from other villages and buy gunpowder. The blacksmith Song Dequan volunteered to repair the steel drills. Finally, according to everyone's opinions, it was decided to establish a canal committee to lead the canal opening work. The whole village elected twelve representatives, dividing into zones to lead twenty-four groups consisting of more than one hundred and fifty people. According to the size of the project in each section and the strength of each group, the representative meeting democratically decided which group would be responsible for which task. When the project was completed, labor was distributed fairly according to the amount of land, five small labor days per day, two *he* of corn per labor day, with surpluses being returned and shortages made up. Everyone also stipulated water usage agreements, passing on a water allocation sign in turn from downstream to upstream to take turns irrigating the land. At the second mass meeting, it was decided that Hao Jincai, the secretary of the Youth League branch, would lead women and children to deliver manure to ensure that spring wheat sowing would not be delayed.
            (III)
    On the morning of the third day of the first lunar month, the sky was not yet bright, and the mountaintop broadcast called out the smoke from every household; just after the second broadcast, the representatives and group leaders led the people to their designated sections. After taking a puff of tobacco, they began to work hard. Some were digging soil, some were moving stones. The sound of explosions from the rocks was like enemies stepping on landmines. Hao Luoyin, the inspection squad leader, was himself moving stones, drilling stone eyes, and also busy inspecting and guiding each section, broadcasting the progress of each section of the project to the people of the whole village on the mountaintop every day. Yu Luolai's section failed to complete its task on the first day and was criticized; the next day, the whole group rallied its spirits, not only completing the task but also exceeding it. The people of the natural village also automatically came to help. Students returning home for winter vacation also actively participated. In particular, Communist Party member Yu Luoyan truly played a leading role. Two days before the project was completed, the dam openings had to be built, and the weather was as cold as winter. People were a little afraid to go into the water. Yu Luoyan shouted, "What are we afraid of being a little cold now? It will save effort when irrigating the land." He took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his cotton pants, and was the first to go into the water to move stones, completing the task in a whole day. Once, an iron shovel broke Yu Luoyan's head, and he bled, wrapped it up with cloth at home, and returned to his post. Everyone persuaded him to rest, but he said, "I can't do heavy work, but I can still do light work." In eighteen days, a main canal more than four *li* long, five *chi* wide, and four to twelve *chi* deep, and dozens of branch canals three *chi* wide and four *chi* deep were completed, which can irrigate more than two hundred *mu* of land.
            (IV)
    The day of the water release was very tense. The farmers lacked knowledge and methods of surveying level, so they looked for level by observing the water flow. If the water flow was not smooth here, everyone went to observe the cause of the slow flow; if there was a leak there, everyone went to plug the opening together; if the dam opening was too large, they went to adjust the amount of water again. The men, women, old, and young who came to visit seemed to be going to a temple fair. An old lady in her sixties or seventies held a child, touched the soil of the canal bank, and said with a smile that she couldn't close her mouth, "This way, we don't have to worry about irrigating the garden." Yes, in the past, each person could only irrigate an average of one *mu* per day, but now even women and children can irrigate more than ten *mu*, and they have saved all the equipment for drilling wells and irrigating the garden; in the past, barley needed eight irrigations, but this year it only needs six irrigations to harvest. From then on, Tiangang Village saved a large part of its labor force, which can be invested in other production.

　　增产粮食的保证
    ——记田岗村水渠的开修
    本报记者  药夫
    刚过春节的第五天，易县四区田岗村新开的水渠修成了。从村后的小山头向四外望去，在村南不大的一小片平原上，布满了大小纵横的渠道。在这幽美如画的土地上，忘我劳动的农民，个个脸上都洋溢着初春的微笑。
            （一）
    田岗是老解放区的农村。在抗日战争开始时，便是最巩固的根据地，因之遭敌人烧杀很重。但它却坚贞地渡过了这最艰苦的岁月。一九四七年冬，彻底完成了土地改革，家家都有了水地。由于全村普遍组织了劳动互助，解决了浇地中遇到的某些困难，生产得以逐年提高。可是，又发生了一个新的难题。最近几年来，河身下降了，随着井水也年年减少，不够使用，浇地时，时断时续，费时费力。这样下去，水地便会慢慢变为旱田了。
            （二）
    战争胜利以后，增产的要求鼓舞着每一个农民。今年一月在区召开的各村生产会议上，区长说：“我们老解放区，最重要的事情，是开展水利，增产粮食，比一九四九年的农业生产提高一成，争取恢复战前水平。”开完这个会，田岗村中共支部，便专门讨论怎样增产。又提出了酝酿数年的老问题——开一道新的水渠吧！但是大家都没有把握。有的说：“开半天，水流不下来，不是白费工吗？”有的说：“为全村的事占私人的地，人多心不齐，谁去管烂摊子呢？”还有个别落后的人，认为开渠会“破坏风水”。但谈来谈去，大家慢慢都想通了，得出一致的结论：只要大家一条心，计划好，领导强，是能够成功的。
    阴历腊月十六日，召开了全村第一次动员大会。支书郝洛士传达了区生产会议的精神和支部的建议后，他说：“今年过年，顶好作到‘三不’：不搭棚唱会戏；不乱串亲戚；不闲逛。利用春节的饽饽、粘糕，去干活多有劲呢。”中心村民兵副指导员和教育委员于有朋向大家保证，到外村借大锤、铁锹、钢钻和买火药。小炉匠宋德全自动要求修理钢钻。最后，根据大家的意见，决议成立水渠委员会，领导开渠工作。全村并选出十二个代表，分片带领由一百五十余人编成的二十四个小组。根据地段工程大小，各组人力强弱，在代表会议上，民主决定那个小组负责那一段任务。工程告竣时，按地亩多少平工，每天五小工，每工二合玉米，多找少补。大家又规定了使水公约，从下游向上游，挨次递牌，轮流浇地。在第二次的群众大会上，决定由青年团支书郝进才，领导妇女儿童送粪，保证不误春麦下种。
            （三）
    正月初三日的早晨，天还不亮，山头广播唤出了户户炊烟；第二次广播刚完，代表和组长就带着人们，向指定的地段出发了。吸过一袋烟后，便紧张地劳动起来。刨土的刨土，搬石的搬石。山石爆炸声，和敌人踏翻地雷一样。检查股郝洛印，自己搬石头，打石眼，还忙着到各段检查指导，天天在山头向全村人们广播各段工程进行的情形。第一天于洛来段没有完成任务，受了批评，第二天全组鼓了鼓劲，不仅完成任务，而且超过了。自然村的人们也自动赶来帮忙。放寒假回家的学生也积极参加。尤其共产党员于洛彦，真正起了带头作用。工程竣工前两天，要垒坝口了，天气冷得像冬天一样。人们有些怕下水。于洛彦喊道：“这当儿凉一点，怕什么？浇地时就省劲了。”他脱了鞋袜，挽起棉裤，先下水搬石头，整整一天完成了任务。有一次，铁锹打破了于洛彦的头，流着血，回家用布缠起，又回到岗位上。大家劝他休息，他说：“不能干重活干轻活还行。”十八天的工夫，完成了宽五尺、深四尺至十二尺、长四里多的干渠一道，和宽三尺、深四尺的支渠数十条，可浇地二百余亩。
            （四）
    放水的那一天是非常紧张的。农民们缺乏测量水平的知识和方法，便看水流来找平。这里水流不畅快，大家去观察流慢的原因；那里漏水了，一齐去堵口；坝口大了，又去调节水量。来来回回参观的男女老幼，好像赶庙会一样。一位六七十岁的老太太拉着小孩子，摸着渠埂的泥土，笑的合不住嘴说：“这可不发愁浇园了。”是的，过去每人每天平均只浇一亩，现在连妇女儿童也能浇十亩多，并且省下了打井浇园的一切用具；过去大麦浇八水，今年只需六水就能收获了。从此，田岗村省出了很大一部分劳动力，可以投入其他生产上去。
                                    一九五○、三、二十九
