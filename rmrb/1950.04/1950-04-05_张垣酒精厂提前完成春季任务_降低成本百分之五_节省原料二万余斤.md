[By Our Newspaper] Chahar Daily News, March 29th: The Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory, under the Chahar Provincial Department of Industry, had a production target of 86,000 jin for the first quarter of this year (January 1st to March 31st). This target was completed ahead of schedule at 21:50 on March 25th, exceeding the target by 30 jin. The estimated raw material consumption was 368,308 jin, but the actual consumption was 342,200 jin, saving 26,108 jin of raw materials. After the first quarter's production target was set, the factory launched a mass record-breaking campaign, increasing output with the existing machinery, equipment, and personnel. Last year, 3,600 jin of raw materials yielded a maximum output of 900 jin; this year, after the raw material input was increased to 4,600 jin after January 16th, the maximum output reached 1,305 jin. The product yield rate was also improved. The average product yield rate in December last year was 23.35 percent, while the 25-day average in March was 26 percent, with a maximum of 28.37 percent, achieving the goal of reducing costs by 5 percent. Through this campaign, new management methods were established, giving the factory a new look. (Alcohol Factory Communications Group)
