Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th. The People's Governments of Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Anhui and other places in East China are actively deploying work to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests before the spring plowing. At the end of last month, the South Jiangsu Administrative Office convened a regional rice borer prevention conference and established the South Jiangsu Rice Borer Control Committee to unify the leadership of the regional rice borer control work. Teachers and students of major middle schools in Wuxi City used the spring break to go to the countryside to publicize the importance and specific methods of rice borer control, eliminating the superstitious idea of the masses that rice borers cannot be cured. In February, the Fujian Provincial Institute of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests Prevention and Control organized ten spring plowing prevention and control teams to go to the countryside to publicize the prevention and control of rice borer damage. Shandong and northern Anhui are actively carrying out the prevention and control of wheat smut and catching locust nymphs. Disease and pest prevention and control stations have been established in each special area of central and southern Shandong to carry out key prevention and control work. The Changhuai District People's Government of Yixu County in northern Anhui mobilized and organized the masses to wipe out all the emerging locust nymphs. In order to further mobilize and organize the masses to carry out the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the East China Military and Political Committee has not only transferred 94 agricultural cadres from various provinces and regions to assist in the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, but also ordered the Shanghai and Shandong Plant Disease and Insecticide Machinery Factories to manufacture a large number of 666, red arsenic, fluorine agents, pure DDT and other insecticides, totaling more than 950 tons, and 10,240 sets of pharmaceutical machinery to meet the needs of various regions. At present, Shanghai has successively shipped out more than 100 tons of agents and more than 2,100 sets of pharmaceutical machinery.
