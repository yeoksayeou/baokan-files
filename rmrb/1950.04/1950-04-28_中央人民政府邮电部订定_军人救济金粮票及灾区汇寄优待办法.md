For remittances to family members in disaster areas (strictly limited to disaster areas), the remittance fee will be reduced by half; letters enclosing remittance slips will be charged at the ordinary mail rate and handled as registered mail; if the disaster area to which the remittance is sent does not have remittance services but only insured mail, it will be allowed to be sent as insured mail, with the insurance fee reduced by half, and postage charged at the ordinary mail rate, and handled as insured mail. For relief funds or grain coupons remitted to family members, all post offices handling insured mail can accept them as insured mail, with the insurance fee reduced by 30 percent, and is not limited to disaster areas; if remittance is to be made and the destination is a disaster area, the preferential measures for remittances to disaster areas mentioned above can be applied; if the destination is not a disaster area, the remittance fee will be reduced by 30 percent, and letter postage and registration fees will be paid as usual. The measures stipulate that the upper limit for the aforementioned relief funds or grain coupons and remittances to disaster areas shall not exceed the postage for 300 pieces of ordinary mail (currently 300,000 yuan), and no preferential treatment will be given to the excess; the period of preferential treatment will last until the end of June this year.
