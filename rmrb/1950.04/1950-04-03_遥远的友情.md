Distant Friendship

　　In February of this year, when the staff of the Embassy of the People's Republic of Hungary in China were leaving Budapest to come to China, the railway workers who were loading their luggage found a rough piece of white paper and a pencil, and wrote down the Hungarian workers' wishes and friendship for the Chinese people, and handed it to them. They brought this letter of friendship from distant Budapest to the newborn Beijing. The translation of the letter is as follows:

　　Dear Chinese Comrades:

　　We sincerely wish you victory, and may you build a common ideal of the working class – socialism – in peace.

　　We, the workers of Hungary, with infinite affection, hope that you can enjoy the fruits of democracy with us and obtain unparalleled happiness. The communism you are embracing will come for the proletariat of the whole world.

　　Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!

　　Long live freedom!

                           Respectfully,
                           All workers of the West Railway Station of Budapest

　　遥远的友情
    今年二月，当匈牙利人民共和国驻华使馆人员离开布达佩斯前来中国的时候，为他们装载行李的铁道工人们临时找了一张粗糙的白纸、一支铅笔，写上了匈牙利工人对中国人民的愿望和友情，交给他们。他们将这份友情的信，从遥远的布达佩斯，带到了新生的北京。这封信的译文如下：亲爱的中国同志：
    我们谨祝你们的胜利，并且愿你们能在和平中建立起工人阶级的共同理想——社会主义。
    我们，匈牙利的工人，以无限的感情，希望你们能和我们一起享受民主的成果，获得无比的幸福。你们拥护着的共产主义是会为全世界的无产阶级而降临的。
    毛泽东同志万岁！
    自由万岁！
                           布达佩斯城西火车站全体工人谨启
