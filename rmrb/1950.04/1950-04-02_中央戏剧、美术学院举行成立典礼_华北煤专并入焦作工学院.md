    [Our Newspaper] The Central Academy of Fine Arts has been formally established in Beijing. The academy was formed by merging the former National Art College and the Fine Arts Department of North China University, and is directly under the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. It was approved by the Government Administration Council in December of last year, and a celebration ceremony was held yesterday (the 1st). The academy has three departments: painting, applied arts, and sculpture, as well as a fine arts cadre training class. There is also a research department and an affiliated fine arts supply cooperative. The current president is Xu Beihong, and there are 68 professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants. Since the beginning of last semester, the faculty and students of the academy have begun to establish the viewpoint that fine arts should serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have paid attention to the popularization of fine arts. The students have taken the initiative to learn to draw comic strips, illustrations, and New Year pictures. At the end of last semester, the first-year students made a summary of their thoughts; during the winter vacation, some teachers and second, third, and fourth-year students, as well as students from the fine arts cadre training class, participated in the land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing, and have undergone great changes in their thinking, learning attitude, and lifestyle. Starting this semester, the students have begun to participate in after-school agricultural production. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, all the faculty and students are moving forward.

The school's more than one hundred faculty and staff members arrived in Jiaozuo from Beijing on March 23rd and officially started classes on March 27th.
    [Another News Item] A group of students from the Department of Metallurgy of Jiaozuo Institute of Technology has recently arrived in Beijing and will be assigned by the Ministry of Fuel Industry to study in the Northeast.
