　　Central Ministry of Health's Epidemic Prevention and Medical Team
　　Establishes Zhuoxian County Health Experiment Zone
　　Gains Preliminary Experience in Improving Rural Health Work
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to gain experience in carrying out rural health work, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government dispatched an epidemic prevention and medical team to Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, in early October last year to establish a health experiment zone. After four and a half months of efforts, it has initially improved local health work and gained some experience.

　　Investigating Health Conditions
　　After arriving in Zhuoxian County, the epidemic prevention team first conducted health propaganda and investigation work. It was understood that the county had 379 villages and more than 260,000 people, most of which were newly liberated areas with a weak foundation in health work. The county had only one public pharmacy, with a small number of beds. There were a total of 454 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners; 67 Western medicine practitioners, of whom only one graduated from a formal medical school. The technical level of doctors was very low. There were more than 300 traditional Chinese medicine shops in the county. The general public felt it was difficult to get medicine and medical treatment, and when they were sick, they often sought people to "pick" and "pinch," and some even prayed to gods and worshiped witches, with superstition becoming an obstacle to the progress of health work. Reactionary Taoist sects were still active, spreading rumors and sabotage. According to the team's investigation, the health of women and children in rural areas was extremely serious: out of 46,320 children, 18,322 died, with a mortality rate of nearly 40%. Among them, 56% of infants who died before the age of one died from umbilical tetanus, mainly due to unhygienic traditional midwifery practices. According to the team's outpatient and laboratory investigations, there were particularly many cases of gastrointestinal diseases due to unsanitary food and drink in rural areas, and more than 85% of the people had roundworms.

　　Conducting Health Propaganda
　　In response to this situation, the team adopted a variety of propaganda methods to enlighten the broad masses to improve health conditions. In addition to regularly explaining health knowledge through collective or individual speeches, blackboards, slogans, and rooftop broadcasts, they also used folk art forms for propaganda. The team tried to perform a play they wrote called "Sister-in-law Wang Raising a Baby," which introduced the new midwifery method and was very popular among the masses. It was performed 26 times in 21 villages, with an audience of over 50,000 people. In addition, they used comic strips, posters, and model exhibitions to explain the symptoms and prevention of women and children's health and several important infectious diseases, which were also of great concern to the masses. When exhibited at the Nanguan Temple Fair, the audience exceeded 7,000 people.

　　Training Over a Thousand Midwives
　　At the same time, the team carried out the work of reforming and training rural midwifery personnel. In four and a half months, a total of 158 training classes were held, training 1,880 midwives. Among them, 40% were reformed old midwives; the remaining newly trained midwives were mostly activists or women's federation cadres among the peasants who had been emancipated. This group of people has played a significant role in improving rural health work. The team conducted three inspections after the training: among 1,191 newborns, 964 were delivered by the new method and did not develop umbilical tetanus or puerperal fever; those who died from other diseases accounted for 9.2%. The remaining newborns delivered by the old method had a mortality rate of 33.5% (the vast majority of deaths were due to umbilical tetanus), and there was also one death from puerperal fever. At the beginning of training midwives, the team encountered some difficulties, such as the general term for midwifery women in rural areas being "old granny," which was considered a lowly occupation; some women were "afraid of showing their faces" and were unwilling to be trained. In order to eliminate such concerns among the masses, the team carried out propaganda and explanation on the one hand, and called the trained midwifery women "midwives"; on the other hand, it coordinated the work of training midwives with the rural women's movement and land reform work, so that the work turned smoothly.

　　Assisting in the Establishment of Health Organizations, Training 800 Health Workers
　　In order to establish grassroots organizations for rural health work, the team assisted the local authorities in establishing health committees at the county, district, and village levels, and trained 784 full-time health workers. The health workers were selected by each village (one man and one woman in each village), and 90% were of peasant origin. During the training, they were taught general health knowledge, symptoms of infectious diseases, and prevention methods. Their responsibilities after returning to the village were to supervise and inspect the health work of each village. The village health committee is a mass health organization, with the village head, the director of the village peasant association, or the secretary of the CCP branch serving as the chairman, and the health worker as a member ex officio, with health groups set up below, with ten households forming a group, to specifically implement the work decided by the health committee. Through this organization, the force for promoting health work in rural areas is greater. Health committees at all levels have established a regular meeting reporting system, and because there are full-time health workers, there have been preliminary achievements in improving rural health work. For example, when measles occurred in Daliu Village in District 1, the health worker not only reported to the higher levels, but also assisted the epidemic prevention team in conducting investigation and treatment work.

　　Mobilizing Primary School Teachers to Assist in Health Work
　　In addition, according to the experience of the epidemic prevention team, mobilizing rural primary school teachers to conduct health propaganda and participate in health work can play a significant role. The team used the opportunity of the collective training of primary school teachers and winter school teachers in Zhuoxian County to explain the theory of preventive vaccination to the teachers and teach them vaccination techniques, and through them and the health workers of each village, completed the autumn universal vaccination campaign in several districts. It also mobilized primary school students to participate in the health activities of each village through primary school teachers, such as adding health programs to the New Year's entertainment activities and organizing Yangko teams to cooperate with cleaning inspections, which were very effective. Before the Spring Festival, the villages carried out a major cleaning, and also launched an early manure transportation campaign. These illustrate that organizing all available forces in rural areas and combining them with the interests and habits of the masses to promote health work is the most effective way.

　　Uniting and Reforming Local Doctors, Assisting in Organizing District Medical Associations
　　In order to unite, reform, and organize local doctors, the team assisted in the establishment of medical associations in all districts of Zhuoxian County; and adapted to the requirements of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to learn new medical techniques, introducing some new drug usages and common knowledge of infectious diseases; and explained the source, diagnosis, and treatment of certain diseases based on actual cases. On the one hand, it improved their skills, and on the other hand, it improved their political awareness and broke down conservative ideas. These have achieved considerable results. The medical associations in each district have generally been able to hold meetings on time, discuss issues related to medical work, and exchange medical experience. The medical associations in each district have put forward the slogan of serving the people's health. The medical association in District 7 has automatically agreed to reduce drug prices, decline banquets from patients to express gratitude, and contributed more than 200 "secret recipes," which were collected into a book and distributed to each district for reference and research. The medical association in District 3 has automatically established a covenant to "report and handle infectious diseases in a timely manner, and guarantee that infectious diseases will not spread from this district."

　　Now the epidemic prevention and medical team has left Zhuoxian County, and all work has been handed over to the local health organization to continue. The Ministry of Health plans to send people to assist the county for a longer period of time to consolidate existing achievements and further gain experience.

　　中央卫生部防疫医疗大队
    建立涿县卫生试验区     
    取得改善农村卫生工作的初步经验
    【本报讯】为取得开展农村卫生工作的经验，中央人民政府卫生部于去年十月初曾派防疫医疗大队前往河北省涿县建立卫生实验区。经四个半月的努力，已初步改善了当地卫生工作，并取得了一些经验。
    调查卫生情况
    防疫大队抵涿县后，首先进行了卫生宣传与调查工作。据了解，该县有三百七十九个村庄，二十六万多人口，绝大部分是新解放区，卫生工作基础薄弱。全县仅有公立药社一所，设有少数病床。中医共有四百五十四人；西医六十七人，其中仅一人为正式医学校出身。医生技术水平都很低。全县有中药铺三百多家。一般群众都感吃药求医困难，有病多找人“挑”“捏”，有的还求神拜佛，迷信巫婆。反动道门仍有活动，造谣破坏，成为卫生工作进行的障碍。据该队调查，农村中妇婴卫生情况至为严重：四六、三二○名儿童中，死亡达一八、三二二名，死亡率将近百分之四十。其中不满一周岁死亡的婴孩，有百分之五十六是患脐风而死的，其主要原因是由于旧法接生的不合卫生。又据该队门诊与化验调查：农村中因饮食不卫生而患肠胃病者特别多，百分之八十五以上的人有蛔虫。
    开展卫生宣传
    该队针对此种情况，采取了多种宣传方式，以启发广大群众改善卫生情况。除经常以集体的或个别的讲话、用黑板报、标语、屋顶广播等解说卫生常识外，并通过民间艺术形式进行宣传。该队曾试演过自己编写的《王二嫂养娃娃》一剧，介绍新接生法，很受群众欢迎。先后在二十一个村演出二十六场，观众达五万人以上。此外，又利用连环画、挂图和模型展览来说明妇婴卫生与几种重要传染病的病状和防治法，亦深为群众所关心，在南关庙会上展览时，观众超过七千人。
    训练千余接产员
    同时，该队进行了改造和培养农村接产人员工作。在四个半月中，共开办了一百五十八个训练班，训练了接产员一千八百八十名。其中百分之四十为改造的旧接产妇；其余新培养的接产员，大都是翻身农民中的积极分子或妇联干部。这批人员在改善农村卫生工作上已起了显著作用。该队在训练后作过三次检查：在一、一九一名初生婴孩中，有九六四名是用新法接生的，都没有发生脐风和产褥热；因其他疾病而死亡的占百分之九点二。而其余用旧法接生的，则有百分之三十三点五死亡（死因绝大部分是脐风），还有一名产褥热死亡。在  开始训练接产员时，该队曾遇到一些困难，如农村间一般称接产妇女为“老娘婆”，认为是下贱事；有的妇女“怕抛头露面”而不愿受训。该队为消除群众此种顾虑，一面进行宣传解释，并称受过训的接产妇女为“接产员”；一面将训练接产员工作与农村妇女运动和土地改革工作配合进行，使工作转向顺利。
    协助建立卫生组织  训练八百名卫生员
    为建立农村卫生工作的基层组织，该队协助当地建立了县、区、村三级的卫生委员会，训练了七百八十四名专任卫生员。卫生员由各村选出（每村男女各一人），百分之九十是农民成份。训练时授以普通卫生常识，传染病症状和预防法等。回村后的职责是督促检查各村的卫生工作。村卫生委员会是一种群众性的卫生组织，由村长、村农会主任或中共支部书记等主要干部兼主任委员，卫生员为当然委员，以下并设卫生小组，每十户编成一组，具体执行卫生委员会决定的工作。通过这一组织，在农村间推动卫生工作的力量就较大。各级卫生委员会均建立了定期的会议汇报制度，因为有了专任卫生员，对改善农村卫生工作已有初步成绩。如一区大柳村发生麻疹时，卫生员不仅向上级作了报告，并协助防疫组进行了调查、处理等工作。
    发动小学教员  协助卫生工作
    此外，据防疫大队的经验，发动农村小学教员进行卫生宣传与参加卫生工作，能发挥很大作用。该队曾利用涿县小学教员与冬学教员集训的机会，向教员讲解预防注射理论并授以种痘技术，通过他们和各村卫生员，完成了几个区的秋季普遍种痘运动。又通过小学教员发动小学生参加各村的卫生活动，如在新年文娱活动中加入卫生节目，组织秧歌队配合清洁检查等，都很收效。春节前，各村进行了大扫除，又发动了提前运肥运动。这些，说明了组织农村一切可用力量，结合群众利益和习惯来推动卫生工作，是最有效的方式。
    团结改造地方医生  协助组织区医联会
    为团结、改造和组织地方医生，该队协助涿县各区普遍成立了医联会；并适应中医对学习新医术的要求，介绍一些新药用法、传染病常识；根据实际病例，进行对某种病的病源、诊断、治疗等的讲解。一面提高其技术，一面又提高其政治觉悟，打破保守思想。这些已收相当效果。各区医联会一般已做到能按时开会，研讨医疗工作上的问题，交流医疗经验。各区医联会都提出了要为人民健康而服务的口号。七区医联会并自动商定减低药价，谢绝病家宴谢，而且把二百多种“秘方”供献出来，搜集成册，分送各区参考研究。三区的医联会更自动订立“遇有传染病及时报告处理，保证不使传染病从本区蔓延起来”的公约。
    现防疫医疗大队已离开涿县，一切工作已交当地卫生组织继续进行。卫生部并拟派人较长期地驻该县协助工作，以巩固现有成绩，更进一步地取得经验。
