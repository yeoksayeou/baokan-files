　　Bolshevik Party Spirit in Economic Work
    Everyone knows: politics and economics are inseparable. They exist and function simultaneously.

    The Communist Party's policy is an indispensable foundation of Soviet social institutions. In contrast to the anarchy of social production in capitalist countries, the Soviet national economy develops according to a unified national plan, moving in the direction determined by the Communist Party's policy, the people's interests, and the great goal of building communism.

    As early as 1921, during the debate on the trade union issue, Lenin emphasized that the economic development of the Soviet state was completely guided by the Party's policy, and in this respect, politics occupied—and could not but occupy—a more important position than economics. Lenin wrote: "Politics is the concentrated expression of economics... To say otherwise is to forget the basic principles of Marxism."

    The inseparability of economics and politics is a fundamental factor in all our construction work and in all the work of the Communist Party in leading the national economy. Soviet economic workers should take the following understanding as their basic starting point: the work entrusted to them is a political work, a Party work; he is a communicator of the Party's policy and a servant of the Soviet state. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "To be a leader in economic work in our country is to gain great honor and great respect, to gain great trust from the proletariat and the people." When solving any problem, our cadres should fully comply with the Party's policy and fully comply with the interests of the Soviet state and the people. Leading cadres in every economic sector should always put the interests of the country above everything else!

    Take the issue of formulating a production plan as an example. Facts and experience have proven that in the process of completing our plans, in the creative labor of millions of workers, engineers, technicians, and production leaders, many new supplementary potential forces have been discovered. The Party requires that our plans should not be based on backward workers or "intermediate" workers as the starting point for formulating plans, but on advanced workers as the starting point. Our plans should estimate as much as possible the various internal potential forces of each industrial sector and each independent enterprise. Attempting to accept "easier" planning tasks, attempting to hide actual potential forces, and attempting to contribute less to the country than what could be contributed under the conditions of straining all forces and mobilizing all favorable conditions—such ideas are contrary to the Bolshevik Party spirit.

    Soviet economic workers should not start from: how to make things easier and more beneficial for "his" enterprise—but should only consider the problem from: what the interests of the country require. Doing so may encounter some difficulties, such as the difficulty of reorganizing the production process and getting used to producing new products that have not been produced before. But what is the big deal about difficulties! Bolsheviks have never retreated in the face of any difficulties, and Bolsheviks have always moved forward on new, untrodden roads. Everyone knows that truly Bolshevik cadres are tested and tempered in the struggle against difficulties.

    Comrade Stalin educates our cadres in this way.

    The patriotic suggestions and constantly rising creative ideas of the Soviet people are discovering all new, internal industrial potential forces every day. The leading cadres of economic departments who forget that they are servants of a Soviet country try to hide the potential forces of enterprises and try to continue to "store up" these potential forces in order not to burden their planning tasks and not to require them to strain their forces further. What will be the result of doing this? The result will be: the interests of the country will be harmed, and the enterprise will contribute less to the country than it could contribute to the country by working according to a lowered plan. A true Bolshevik, a person with a strong Party spirit, will not do this. He himself will demand, based on his own will: that the production plan can be expanded and that the potential forces discovered by the creativity of the masses can be fully utilized.

    As a servant of the country, Soviet economic workers should cherish the property of the country. However, there are still some economic workers who believe that some laws and regulations of the Party and the state are not made for them, and they do not need to abide by the discipline of the Party and the state. Such economic workers have always adopted a casual and indifferent attitude towards the facts of stealing and embezzling state property, and they themselves often give away state property generously. Such "good uncles" and "benevolent people" have no Party spirit at all when they treat state property! Because true Party spirit requires, first of all, the strictest adherence to the interests of the country.

    A Soviet economic worker should have the noble quality of a sense of new things. He should rely on the Party organization in his work, rely on the creative initiative and patriotic suggestions of the masses. The reality of the Soviet Union's economic sector plans is built on the basis of the living, practical work of millions of workers. Now, the level of all kinds of Party political work and Party organizational work has been greatly improved; our Party organizations have accumulated rich experience in leading the masses; the level of socialist consciousness of the masses themselves, their enthusiasm for patriotic suggestions, and their political and labor enthusiasm have reached an unprecedented height. Economic workers who do not understand the decisive significance of Party organizations and the working masses in the struggle to complete and overfulfill production plans are inevitably doomed to failure!

    There is also another type of economic worker who thinks: as long as the factory director responsibility system is in place, then it is possible to command the entire factory without the support of activists, to lead by issuing orders, and to treat workers, engineers, and production leaders arrogantly like princes and nobles. This kind of arrogant economic worker neither understands what the factory director responsibility system is, nor understands what Party spirit is. The true meaning of the factory director responsibility system does not only mean having the right, but also having the ability to handle various affairs, to organize various work, to select and allocate cadres, to issue correct instructions, to solicit reports on the work entrusted to others, and to eliminate the phenomenon of irresponsibility and unclear division of labor. At the same time, the factory director responsibility system means: the factory director must have the ability to rely on the Party organization, rely on the advanced elements of the enterprise, and rely on all the employees of the enterprise in his work.

    Only in places where Party work appears weak, only in places where Party organizations abandon their supervisory power over administrative work, and only in places where an atmosphere of complacency, arrogance, and mutual flattery replaces true Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, will leading cadres of economic departments detach themselves from Party organizations and the masses.

    Party organizations should educate our cadres in the spirit of strengthening Party spirit, should not allow any economic worker to detach himself from Party organizations, forget his obligations as a Communist Party member, and attempt not to participate in Party work. It is extremely necessary to work constantly to improve the ideological and theoretical level of economic work cadres, and to strive to enable them to master the theory of Marxism-Leninism and teach them to apply this theory in solving various practical problems. It must be remembered that true Bolshevik cadres can only be educated under conditions of open and sincere self-criticism, so criticism and self-criticism should be widely unfolded.

    The Party has cultivated a group of very outstanding economic work cadres, promoted them to high positions, and created various favorable conditions to further enrich their ideological awareness and practical experience. They are all people who are familiar with things and are loyally dedicated to our Party. But history does not stand still. It is constantly developing forward. In front of all sectors of the national economy, various increasingly complex and increasingly important tasks are constantly emerging. In order to enable our economic work cadres to stand at the forefront of these new tasks, we must strengthen their Marxist-Leninist education and political training, and we must strive to further implement the spirit of Bolshevik Party spirit into—from the bottom up—any part of our economic construction work.

### 在经济工作中的布尔什维克党性

　　在经济工作中的布尔什维克党性
    谁都知道：政治和经济是分不开的，它们是同时存在着的，是同时起着作用的。
    共产党的政策，是苏维埃社会机构的一个必不可少的基础。与资本主义国家的社会生产的无政府状态相反，苏联的国民经济，是按照着统一的国家计划发展的，是向着那个由共产党的政策，由人民的利益和由建设共产主义的伟大目标这三者所规定出来的方向发展的。
    还是在一九二一年争论职工会问题的时候，列宁就曾经着重指出过：苏维埃国家的经济发展，完完全全地是由党的政策所指导着的，并且在这一方面来说，政治是占着——而且不可能不占着——比经济更重要的地位的。列宁写道：“政治是经济的集中表现……要不这样说的话，那就是忘掉了马克思主义的基本原则。”
    经济和政治的不可分离性，是所有我们的建设工作中的，和共产党的在领导国民经济这一方面一切工作中的一个基本因素。苏维埃国家的经济工作人员，应该把下面一个认识作为自己看问题的基本出发点：所委托给他做的那个工作，是一个政治性的工作，是一个党的工作；他是党的政策的一个传达者，是苏维埃国家的一个勤务员。斯大林同志指出说：“在我们的国家中作一个经济工作的领导者，是能获得极大的荣誉和极大的尊敬的，是能获得无产阶级方面和人民方面的极大的信任的。”在解决任何一个问题的时候，我们的干部是应该完全遵照着党的政策的，是应该完全遵照着苏维埃国家的利益和人民的利益的。每一个经济部门中的领导干部，都应该永远把国家的利益看得高于一切！
    拿一个象制订生产计划这样的问题来着。事实和经验证明：在我们计划的完成过程中，在千百万的工人，工程师，技师和生产领导干部的创造性的劳动过程中，发现出了许多新的补助的潜在力量。党要求做到：我们的计划不是拿落后的工人或者拿“中间的”工人来作制订计划的出发点而是拿先进的工人来作为出发点的，我们的计划是尽可能地估计着每一工业部门和每一独立企业的各种内部潜在力量的。企图接受“较轻松的”计划任务，企图把实际的潜在力量隐藏下去，企图对国家贡献得少于在紧张起全部力量和动员起一切有利条件的条件下可能贡献的东西，——这种想法都是与布尔什维克的党性相违背的。
    苏维埃国家的经济工作人员是不应该从：怎样对“他的”企业更轻松，更有利——这一点出发，而是只应该从：国家的利益要求什么——这一点出发来考虑问题的。这样做是会碰着一些困难的，比如说，是会碰着要改组生产过程，要习惯于生产那种新的，至今尚未生产过的产品的困难的。但是说什么困难不困难呢！布尔什维克从来也没有在任何困难面前后退过，布尔什维克从来都是走着新的，没有人走过的道路前进的。谁都知道：真正布尔什维克的干部就是在与困难的斗争中被考验和被锻炼出来的。
    斯大林同志是这样教育着我们的干部的。
    苏联人的那种爱国的建议和经常高涨的创造思想，每天每天发掘着一切新的，工业内部的潜在力量。那种忘记了自己是一个苏维埃国家的勤务员的经济部门的领导干部，是为了要不加重他的计划任务，为了要不要求他更紧张起他的力量来而极力想把企业的潜在力量隐藏起来，而极力想把这些潜在力量继续“储藏下去”的。这样做的结果将是什么呢？结果将是：国家的利益将受到损害，企业将依照着那种被压低了的计划工作而对国家贡献出少于它所能贡献给国家的东西来。一个真正的布尔什维克，一个有着坚强党性的人，是不会这样做的。他自己会依据了自己的意志而要求：生产计划能得到扩大，那种由群众的创造性所发掘出来的潜在力量能充分地得到利用。
    作为一个国家的勤务员的苏维埃国家的经济工作人员，是应该爱惜国家的财产的。然而，还是有着这样的一些经济工作人员，他们认为：党和国家的一些法律条文并不是为了他们而订的，他们是没有必要去遵守那些党和国家的纪律的。这样的经济工作人员，对于那种窃取和盗卖国家财产的事实是一贯采取着随随便便和爱理不理的态度的，而且他们自己也是常常慷着国家之慨的。像这样的“好叔叔”和“善人”，当他们对待国家财产的时候，是连一点儿的党性也没有的！因为真正的党性，首先是要求着能做到对国家利益的最严格的遵守的。
    一个苏维埃国家的经济工作人员，是应该有着对新鲜事物的感觉这高贵的品质的。他应该是在自己的工作中依靠着党的组织，依靠着群众的那种创造的积极性和爱国的建议的。苏维埃国家的经济部门的计划的现实性，是建筑在千百万劳动者的活的、实际的工作的基础上的。现在，所有各种党的政治工作和党的组织工作的水准都已经大大地提高了；我们的党的组织都已经积累了丰富的领导群众的经验；群众本身的社会主义觉悟程度，他们的爱国的建议热情，以及他们的政治热情和劳动热情，都达到了前所未有的高度。那种不了解党的组织和劳动群众在为争取生产计划的完成和超过完成的斗争中的决定意义的经济工作人员，不可避免地是会遭受到失败的！
    另外还有一种这样的经济工作人员，他们想：只要是厂长负责制，那末，就可以不用积极分子的支助而来命令全厂，就可以发号施令地来领导，就可以象王爷贵族一样骄傲地来对待工人，工程师和领导生产的干部的。这种自高自大的经济工作人员既一点儿也没有懂得什么叫厂长专责制，也一点儿也没有懂得什么叫党性。真正的厂长专责制的意思并不只是说有着权利，而且还要有着才能来处理各种事务，来组织各种工作，来选择和配备干部，来发出正确的指示，来索取交给别人去负责的工作的报告，来消除不负责任的现象和分工不明确的现象。而且同时，厂长负责制的意思就是说：厂长要有着在自己的工作中依靠党的组织，依靠企业的先进分子和依靠企业的全体职工的这种能力。
    只有在党的工作显得薄弱的那种地方，只有在党的组织放弃着它对行政工作的监督权的那种地方，以及只有在悠然自得，自高自大和互相捧场的空气代替着真正的布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的地方，经济部门的领导干部才会脱离开党的组织和群众。
    党的组织应该用加强党性的精神来教育我们的干部，应该不使任何一个经济工作人员脱离开党的组织，忘掉自己的作为一个共产党员的应尽义务，能企图不参加做党的工作。经常不断地为提高经济工作干部的思想水平和理论水平而工作，以及为使他们能掌握马列主义的理论并教给他们在解决各种实际问题时应用这一理论而努力工作，是极为必要的。必须记住：只有在公开和诚恳的自我批评的条件下才能够教育出真正的布尔什维克干部，因此应该广泛地来展开批评和自我批评。
    党培养出了一批非常优秀的经济工作干部，把他们提拔到了很高的地位上去，并且为了更进一步地丰富他们的思想意识和实际经验而创设了各种有利条件。他们都是些熟悉着事情而又忠心地献身于我们的党的人。但是历史并不会停住不动。它是一刻不停地往前发展着的。在所有国民经济的一切部门前面，不断地产生着各种越来越复杂，越来越重大的任务。为了要使我们的经济工作干部能站在这些新的任务的最前列，必须加强他们的马列主义教育和政治锻炼，必须努力使得布尔什维克党性的精神更进一步地贯彻到——从下至上地贯彻到——我们的经济建设工作的任何一个部分中去。
