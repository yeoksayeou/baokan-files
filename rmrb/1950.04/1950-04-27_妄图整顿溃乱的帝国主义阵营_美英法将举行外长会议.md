　　Attempting to Rectify the Collapsing Imperialist Camp
    US, Britain, and France to Hold Foreign Ministers' Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 26th] Official sources from the United States, Britain, and France have successively announced that a foreign ministers' meeting of the three countries will be held in London in early May. US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup has already gone to London and, starting April 24th, is holding preparatory meetings for the three foreign ministers' meeting with British Foreign Office Permanent Under-Secretary Strang and French Ambassador to Britain Massigli.
    The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting last November. Since then, the imperialist camp's aggressive policies have continued to suffer disastrous defeats, and they must seek countermeasures. This is like what the Agence France-Presse Washington dispatch on April 3rd quoted American diplomatic sources as saying: "Since the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb and the Soviet Union and China formed an alliance, the three foreign ministers' meeting has long been extremely necessary."
    A United Press London dispatch on April 16th called this meeting "the most important meeting of Western countries since the war" and said it would "conduct a very extensive review of international policy and Western cooperation issues." This means that the imperialist bloc will comprehensively consider its obviously failing aggressive policies at this meeting and rectify its collapsing camp. A United Press London dispatch on April 24th further revealed: "The US Secretary of State will peddle his concept of 'overall diplomacy' at the meeting" to conduct "overall cold war." It can be predicted that the United States will, more forcefully than at the last meeting, compel Britain and France to follow all US policies, and will further compel the latter to implement the US plan to completely "integrate" Western Europe militarily, economically, and even politically.
    Various sources revealed that the issues likely to be included on the agenda of the three foreign ministers' meeting include: (1) Strengthening the "cold war" against the Soviet Union; (2) Strengthening war institutions and war preparations; (3) Strengthening the offensive against colonial liberation movements in the East, as well as organizing the Pacific alliance, implementing the Asian Marshall Plan, and dealing with the new China; (4) Preparing to unilaterally conclude peace treaties with Germany, Japan, and Austria; (5) Establishing a Western European Payments Union, abolishing Western European trade barriers, and realizing Western European integration; (6) Formulating new tactics for atomic bomb blackmail; (7) Having West Germany and Franco's Spain participate in the Western European bloc.
    Such a vast agenda and the fact that the United States will send the largest and most important delegation since the war to participate in the meeting, as Agence France-Presse claims, shows how difficult and embarrassed the imperialist camp has become on all major issues in the world.
    In preparation for this meeting, the United States has made meticulous arrangements. Since the last three foreign ministers' meeting, the meeting of US envoys to various Far Eastern countries held in Bangkok, the meeting of US envoys to various Middle Eastern and Near Eastern countries held in Cairo, the series of military meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries held in The Hague, the Council meeting of the so-called "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" held in Paris, the meeting of the so-called "Council of Europe" held in Strasbourg, the consultation meeting of the so-called "Western European Union" held in Brussels, and the so-called "Far East Economic Conference" held in Tokyo, all show the efforts made by the United States to redeploy its aggressive policies in the East and the West. However, almost all meetings have proved that there are insurmountable contradictions within the imperialist camp, and either no definite results can be achieved, or if results are achieved, they encounter serious difficulties in implementation.
    The prevailing opinions in Western countries before the meeting undisguisedly revealed pessimism about the prospects of this three foreign ministers' meeting. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on April 20th, well-informed sources in Washington gloomily stated: "Formal decisions on the issues on the agenda cannot be made in London because they are distant goals that require long-term research."

### 妄图整顿溃乱的帝国主义阵营  美英法将举行外长会议

　　妄图整顿溃乱的帝国主义阵营
    美英法将举行外长会议
    【新华社二十六日讯】美英法三国官方先后宣布于五月初在伦敦举行三国外长会议。美国无任所大使耶塞普已赴伦敦，并于四月二十四日起与英国外交部常务次官斯特朗、法国驻英大使马西格里举行三外长会议的预备会议。
    美英法三国外长曾于去年十一月举行过会议。自那时以来，帝国主义阵营的侵略政策继续遭受惨败，他们必须觅取对策。这就象法新社四月三日华盛顿电引美国外交界人士所说的：“自从苏联发生原子弹爆炸以及苏联与中国结成联盟以来，三外长会议久已至为必要。”
    合众社伦敦四月十六日电把这次会议称为西方国家“战后最重要的一次会议”，将“对国际政策与西方合作问题作极广泛的检讨”。这就是说，帝国主义集团将在这次会议上全盘考虑其败迹昭著的侵略政策，并整顿其溃乱的阵营。合众社伦敦二十四日电又透露：“美国国务卿将在会议上兜售其‘总体外交’的概念”，以进行“总体冷战”。可以预卜美国将较上次会议更进一步地以强力逼迫英法，追随美国的一切政策，并将进一步逼迫后者执行美国使西欧在军事上、经济上以至政治上完全“整体化”的计划。
    各方消息透露：可能列入三外长会议议程上的问题包括：（一）加强对苏联“冷战”问题；（二）加强战争机构与战争准备的问题；（三）加强在东方进攻殖民地解放运动的问题，以及组织太平洋联盟，实行亚洲马歇尔计划与对付新中国的问题；（四）准备片面缔结对德对日对奥和约问题；（五）设立西欧支付同盟，废除西欧贸易壁垒，实现西欧整体化的问题；（六）制订原子弹讹诈的新策略问题；（七）使西德与佛朗哥西班牙参加西欧集团问题。
    如此庞杂的议程以及据法新社所称美国将派出战后最庞大最重要的代表团参加会议一事，表明帝国主义阵营在世界一切重大问题上已陷入如何困难与狼狈的境地。
    为了准备这次会议，美国曾进行了处心积虑的布置。自上次三外长会议以来，在曼谷举行的美国驻远东各国使节会议，在开罗举行的美国驻中东、近东各国使节会议，在海牙举行的北大西洋公约国家一连串的军事会议，在巴黎举行的所谓“欧洲经济合作局”的理事会议，在斯特拉斯堡举行的所谓“欧洲委员会”会议，在布鲁塞尔举行的所谓“西欧联盟”的协商会议，以及在东京召开的所谓“远东经济会议”等，都表明美国为重新部署其在东方和西方的侵略政策而进行的努力。但是，几乎所有的会议都证明，帝国主义阵营内部存在着不可克服的矛盾，而不能获致确定的结果，或获有结果而在实行上遭到严重的困难。
    西方国家在会前流行的意见，不可掩饰地流露出对这次三外长会议前途的悲观。据法新社四月二十日电称：华盛顿消息灵通人士黯淡地表示：“在议程上的问题的正式决定，不能在伦敦作出，因为它们是遥远的目的，需要长时的研究。”
