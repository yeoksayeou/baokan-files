　　I am Grateful to the People's Cultural Center
    Letter from Cai Wenxing, Shop Assistant, Ningjin, Hebei
    To the Editors:
    I am a shop assistant, and I am eighteen years old this year. I only went to primary school for three and a half years, but my current level of education is much higher than when I left school.
    When I left school, I wanted to join the revolutionary work and serve the people. But because of difficult family circumstances, I had no choice but to become an apprentice in a business. At that time, I was very pessimistic about my future.
    Later, the People's Government established the People's Cultural Center. I had a good place to study, and the staff members there patiently helped me learn. So, whenever I had time, I went to the People's Cultural Center to study. This not only improved my educational level but also raised my political awareness, enabling me to establish a revolutionary outlook on life and devote myself wholeheartedly to the construction of the New Democratic China and the complete liberation of all mankind.
    Last winter, the People's Republic of China was founded, and the county's Federation of Trade Unions organized the shop workers. I joined our own organization, the Shop Workers' Union. Later, when the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Ningjin County was held, I was elected as a representative of shop assistants and attended three sessions of the People's Representative Conference of all circles. Now I have also joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and took an oath before Chairman Mao's portrait, which has further strengthened my determination to serve the people.

### 我感谢人民文化馆  河北宁晋店员蔡文兴来信

　　我感谢人民文化馆
    河北宁晋店员蔡文兴来信编辑同志：
    我是个店员，今年十八岁了。我只上过三年半小学，但是我现在的文化程度，比离开学校的时候，已经提高多了。
    在我离开学校时，本想参加革命工作，为人民服务。但因为家中生活困难，不得已只好进一家商号当学徒。那时候，我对自己的前途非常悲观。
    后来，人民政府设立了人民文化馆。我有了学习的好地方，里面的工作干部很耐心地帮助我学习。于是，我一有时间就去人民文化馆学习。这不但提高了我的文化水平，而且提高了我的政治觉悟，使我建立了革命的人生观，全心全意为新民主主义中国的建设事业及全人类的彻底解放奋斗到底。
    去年冬天，中华人民共和国成立了，县总工会把店员工人组织起来，我参加了我们工人自己的组织店员工会。后来宁晋县各界人民代表会议召开时，我被选为店员代表，出席了三次各界人民代表会议。现在我又参加了中国新民主主义青年团，在毛主席像前宣了誓，这使我为人民服务的决心更加坚定了。
            河北省宁晋县店员  蔡文兴
