　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st -- TASS, Moscow, April 17th: On April 15th, *Pravda* reprinted in full the report by Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, at the 18th Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. This report was published in the *Akahata* on January 24th of this year. After pointing out that the strength of the people is achieving victory on an international scale and that the world economic crisis and class struggle are intensifying, Tokuda further pointed out: The Yoshida's Liberal Party government has become a government of national scum. Tokuda elaborated in detail on the disastrous consequences of the Yoshida Cabinet's traitorous activities, and then turned to the current policies of the Japanese Communist Party. He pointed out: In the party program put forward by our party at the Sixth Congress three years ago, the following are listed first: (1) Strictly implement the Potsdam Declaration; (2) The people themselves revive the economy and achieve complete independence for Japan. These two points are the basis for our current demand for a "comprehensive peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration." Now, in order to more clearly define the party's policy, it is necessary to put forward the following slogans: (1) Oppose a separate peace treaty that will cause war. Promote a comprehensive peace treaty based on coordination among the major powers to ensure peace. (2) Oppose a separate peace treaty that strengthens colonialism and fascism. Promote a comprehensive peace treaty of freedom, independence, democracy, and prosperity. Tokuda then stated: For these issues, it is necessary to base ourselves on implementing the immediate demands of the masses and develop these demands into class and political demands. We maintain that this will be the decisive method for realizing the people's revolution.

　　真理报全文发表德田报告
    德田在日共中委会上指出：必须根据波茨坦宣言全面缔和，党应该贯彻人民切身要求，实现人民革命。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：四月十五日，真理报全文转载日本共产党总书记德田球一在日本共产党中央委员会第十八次扩大会议上的报告。这个报告发表在今年一月二十四日的赤旗报上。德田在指出人民的力量在国际范围内正在取得胜利和世界经济危机与阶级斗争日益加剧之后，进一步指明：吉田的民主自由党政府已变为民族败类的政府。德田详细论述了吉田内阁的卖国活动的祸害结果，随即转而谈到日本共产党的当前政策。他指出：我们党在三年前第六次大会上所提出的党纲中，首先列举：（一）严正履行波茨坦宣言；（二）由人民自己复兴经济和日本完全独立。这两点就是我们目前要求缔结“根据波茨坦宣言的全面和约”的基础。现在，为了更明白地确定党的政策起见，有必要提出下列口号：（一）反对将引起战争的单独和约。促进以大国之间的协调为基础来保障和平的全面和约。（二）反对加强殖民地化和法西斯主义的单独和约。促进自由、独立、民主和繁荣的全面和约。德田继称：对于这些问题，必须把基础点放在贯彻群众的切身要求上，并把这些要求发展为阶级和政治的要求。我们主张：这将是实现人民革命的决定性的方法。
