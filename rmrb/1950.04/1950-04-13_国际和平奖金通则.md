　　International Peace Prize Regulations

　　The Second Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace adopted the establishment of the International Peace Prize last October to encourage cultural workers to devote themselves to the cause of defending peace. The deadline for submitting works for the 1950 selection was originally set for April 1st by various countries. Although the deadline has passed, we are publishing these regulations in a special issue, hoping to attract the attention and efforts of Chinese cultural and artistic workers.

　　Article 1—In accordance with the resolution of the First World Congress of Defenders of Peace, three International Peace Prizes are established, each with a prize of five million francs, sponsored by the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, and awarded annually.

　　Article 2—The prize will be awarded separately to published works (books, films, works of art) that have made the most significant contributions to consolidating human peace.

　　Article 3—The committee has the right to suspend the prize if it deems the quality of the works received to be unsatisfactory.

　　Article 4—Works may be submitted for competition by public organizations, third parties, or the authors themselves.

　　Article 5—The Peace Prize will be awarded by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace. The committee organizes a jury to make an initial screening of the works, then the jury reviews the works participating in the competition and submits its assessment to the committee, which then makes the final decision to award the prize. The awarding of the prize is decided by a majority vote of the members present at the committee meeting. The jury designated by the committee consists of eleven reviewers of different nationalities, one of whom serves as chairman and two as vice-chairmen.

　　Article 6—Countries may, with the consent of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, form a jury to conduct a preliminary screening of the works submitted domestically.

　　Article 7—Works that do not win prizes but are of value may be brought to the attention of people around the world by the jury through all appropriate means.

　　Article 8—The round-trip transportation costs for works participating in the competition shall be borne by the participants or by the national organizations submitting them.

　　Article 9—All works shall be submitted to the jury by January 1st of each year.

　　Article 10—Necessary and detailed explanations regarding the conditions for participating in the prize competition and the methods adopted for awarding the prize will be announced later.
