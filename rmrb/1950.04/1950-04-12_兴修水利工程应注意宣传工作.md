To the Editor:

　　On March 30th, I followed my unit to Xianghe County, Jidong, to participate in a river excavation and dike construction project. Before we set off, I listened to a report from my superiors, which gave me a general understanding of the great significance of the river excavation and dike construction for the Jidong area, which has suffered from floods for many years. I thought that the local people must know even more clearly. However, after talking with several farmers, I received the following answers: "How much land will be ruined by digging the river!", "Flooding comes from the mountains, digging the river won't stop the floods." Some even said: "Digging the river is not good for us here, it is only good for Sanhe and Baodi."

　　These words represent the opinions of some of the farmers. They did not see the benefits of the canals for future irrigation, nor did they take into account other areas that suffer from floods all year round. They only felt that they would suffer a little temporary loss personally. Our residence, Houtao Village, Xianghe Third District, has about eighty households. The district government mobilized them to send twenty laborers to participate in the river excavation and dike construction, but they could not even get that many. I asked them: "You suffered a lot here last year, wouldn't participating in the river excavation and earning some rice solve your difficulties?" They replied: "Let's do other production! Digging the river is no fun!"

　　Why have the farmers become so indifferent to this huge water conservancy project? Obviously, our publicity work has not been done enough or well enough. We should carry out widespread and in-depth explanations and publicity work among the farmers. Our local newspapers should provide such materials. For example, the reasons for the continuous disasters caused by the Jian'gan River, the biggest scourge in Jidong, statistics on the lives and property losses caused each year, the overall plan for repairing and excavating this river, the manpower and material resources mobilized, and the benefits that the repaired river will bring to the people of Jidong, etc., should be systematically and clearly introduced, so that everyone participating in the project understands its importance, and good publicity and explanation work can be carried out among the masses. In addition, the government should also announce a concrete plan for how to deal with the wheat fields or ground that are excavated, in order to resolve the concerns of the masses.

To the Editor:

　　It is very important to strengthen the publicity and education work for the masses when constructing water conservancy projects. Because in the construction of water conservancy projects, disputes often occur among the masses of several villages due to different interests; especially in the newly liberated areas, when disputes occur among the masses, Kuomintang agents will take the opportunity to incite and provoke, causing the incident to escalate.

　　Let's take the example of the incident in Shangdong District, Sheng County, Zhejiang Province: The Dongshan villagers in Shangdong District wanted to build a sluice, and the Yuxi villagers had no major objections, but seven bad elements (such as Li Fajin, known as "Five Tigers," who was the sworn brother of bandit leader Zhu Lougen, Li Yueliang, nicknamed "Commander-in-Chief of the Mountains," and Li Lanfang, a puppet township chief) tried their best to instigate the masses to oppose the construction of the sluice and incite fighting; some even took advantage of our government personnel's mediation of the dispute to control the backward thinking of the masses and alienate the relationship between the government and the masses. The cadres did not realize the complexity of the water conservancy problem beforehand, simplified the work, and were politically numb, only calling on the peasants without in-depth education. Therefore, they failed to prevent the dispute in advance.

　　After the dispute occurred, the Sheng County People's Government and the Sheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately grasped the education of the masses, thus quickly resolving the situation without causing a major disturbance.

　　Now many places across the country are building water conservancy projects. In order to make the cadres pay attention to the work of carrying out publicity and education to the peasants beforehand, therefore, I am presenting the incident that occurred in our county for their reference.

　　兴修水利工程应注意宣传工作
    编辑同志：
    三月三十日，我随部队到冀东香河县参加挖河修堤工程，行前听过上级的报告，大体了解挖河修堤对连年水患的冀东地区的重大意义；我本以为当地的老百姓一定知道的更清楚。那知和几位农民谈过之后，却得到了这样的回答：“挖河要毁掉多少地呀！”，“发水是山上流下来的，挖河也挡不住发大水。”有的还说：“挖河对我们这方没有好处，只对三河、宝坻有好处。”
    这些话代表了一部分的农民的意见，他们没有看到河渠对今后灌溉上的益处，也没有顾及常年遭受水害的其他地区，只是觉得个人暂时受到一点损失。我们住的香河三区后套村，共有八十来户人家，区政府动员他们出二十名民伕参加挖河修堤，结果还出不齐，我问他们：“你们这里去年落的很苦，参加挖河挣些米不就解决了困难？”他们回答我：“搞别的生产吧！挖河没劲！”
    为什么造成了农民们对这一巨大水利工程不重视呢？显然是我们的宣传工作作的不够或作得不好的原故。应该在农民中展开普遍深入的解释和宣传工作，我们的地方报纸，就应供给这种材料。如冀东为患最大的箭杆河连年致患的原因，每年造成的人命和财产损失的统计，修挖这条河渠的总计划，动员的人力和物力，修好后给冀东一带人民增加的福利等等，有系统地明白扼要地介绍出来，使每一位参加工程的人都明了了它的重要性，在群众中就可以进行很好的宣传与解释工作。另外政府对挖掘的麦田或地面作怎样处理，也应公布一个具体的办法，以解决群众的顾虑。
                                        特军邮五支队  刘其义编辑同志：
    在兴修水利工程时，加强对群众的宣传教育工作是非常重要的。因为在兴修水利工程中，往往几个村子的群众因利害关系不同，而发生纠纷；尤其在新解放区，当群众发生纠纷时，则国民党特务更会乘机煽动挑拨，使事件闹大。
    举我们浙江省嵊县上东区的事件为例吧：上东区东山群众要修闸，渔溪村群众没有大意见，但有七个坏分子（如称为“五虎”的李法金是匪首竺楼根的结拜兄弟、外号“沿山总司令”的李岳良、伪乡总干事李兰芳等）竭力鼓动群众反对修闸，煽动打架；更有的乘我政府人员调解纠纷时，则掌握落后群众思想，离间政府与群众之间的关系。而干部事先没有认识到水利问题的复杂性，工作简单化，政治上麻痹，只号召没有深入的对农民进行教育。因而未能将纠纷预先防止。
    纠纷发生后，嵊县人民政府和中共嵊县县委即抓紧对群众教育，因而迅速解决，没有闹成大乱子。
    现在全国有许多地方在兴修水利工程，为了使干部重视事先对农民进行宣传教育的工作，因此，我把我县发生的事件提出来供他们参考。
