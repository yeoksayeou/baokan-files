After arriving in Beijing, the troupe will first entertain literary and art circles, various trade unions, institutions, organizations, and employees of the Ministry of Railways at the Ministry of Railways Auditorium. If other institutions, organizations, or factories need to use the play to organize evening parties, the troupe is also willing to serve. (Meng Huafeng)
