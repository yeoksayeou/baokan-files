　　“Everywhere are Rich Resources and Brave People”
    ——A Record of the Joint Celebration Between the Tsinghua Electrical Engineering Department Class of '53 and the Northwest Visiting Group
    Collective writing by Tsinghua Electrical Engineering Department Class of '53
    On the evening of April 3rd, a large group of joyful people gathered in front of the Summer Palace. Among them were Hui, Tibetan, Tatar, Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, and Han people. This was the farewell of the Northwest Women's and Youth Visiting Group and our Electrical Engineering Department Class of '53.
    Clapping, cheering, shaking hands, and embracing, finally, everyone lifted the comrades of the visiting group high into the air.
    In the slogans of "Long Live Chairman Mao" and the songs of "Under the Bright Banner of the Communist Party," we shook hands and said goodbye.
    This is a day that can never be erased. On this day, we and our Northwest compatriots held hands, stood shoulder to shoulder, walked through every corner of the Summer Palace, and established an inseparable bond. On this day, we held a forum with them in "A Painting Tour," which strengthened our love for the motherland and the Soviet Union, and strengthened our confidence in the construction of the new China.
    The Northwest people are healthy and brave. In the past, they suffered from the dual oppression of class and ethnicity. In the harsh environment, they never stopped their heroic struggle. A Uyghur representative told us that he had been imprisoned by the reactionaries for four years for fighting for national liberation, and suffered all kinds of torture and beatings by the reactionaries. He was hung upside down from the beam and had chili water poured into his nose. Although his body was destroyed, he continued to study Marxism-Leninism in prison, learning Chinese characters by drawing them on the ground with his fingers. After being released from prison, he was able to translate "Popular Philosophy" into Uyghur.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have unparalleled confidence in the construction of the new China, especially the construction of the new Northwest. The head of the visiting group told us that the Northwest has rich mineral resources such as oil, which are indispensable resources for China's industrialization. They believe in their own strength and in the leadership of the Communist Party. They are convinced that under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, with the fraternal assistance of the great socialist Soviet Union, they will surely build buildings and factories in the vast desert area within ten years.
    They were particularly excited about the recently signed three agreements on Sino-Soviet economic cooperation. One representative said: "This time, the Soviet Union is helping us develop the oil mines in the Northwest and helping us solve some problems that we cannot solve ourselves and need to be solved immediately. Today, this is the best and most powerful help, and it is another concrete manifestation of continuing the help they have given us in the past." Another representative said: "There is an oil mine in Yumen, but now because of the lack of machinery, the oil cannot be completely refined, and most of it flows into the gullies. Now it's great, with the help of Soviet friends, we can quickly establish the foundation of industry. I will definitely study Marxism-Leninism hard, work hard to promote national unity, and support this treaty with action."
    These things, these words, gave us encouragement and education in the memories of the return journey. On the road, we talked enthusiastically about today's events. One student said: "Today I realized the brightness of the construction of the Northwest and the brightness of the construction of the motherland. China is full of rich resources and brave people."
    Old Li said: "When we expressed our willingness to work in the Northwest after graduation, they cheered so enthusiastically. Applause again and again showed their sincere welcome. This made me feel that I was standing in every part of China, just like standing in my own home."
    "Strengthen our study!" Someone shouted loudly in front: "Repay their kindness with our actual work achievements."

　　“到处是富源和勇敢的人民”
    ——记清华电机系四年级与西北参观团的联欢
    清华电四同学集体执笔
    四月三日的傍晚，在颐和园门前，聚集着一大群欢乐的人们。这里面有回人、藏人、塔塔尔人、维吾尔人、哈萨克人、乌兹别克人和汉人。这是西北妇女、青年参观团和我们电四同学在告别。
    拍手、欢呼、握手、拥抱，最后，大家把参观团的同志们高高地举到空中。
    在“毛主席万岁”的口号中，在“在共产党鲜明的旗帜下”的歌声中，我们握手告别。
    这是永远不能磨灭的一天。这一天，我们和西北同胞们手拉着手，肩并着肩，走遍了颐和园的每一个角落，建立了不可分离的感情。这一天，我们和他们在“画中游”开了座谈会，增强了我们对祖国、对苏联的热爱，增强了对新中国建设的信心。
    西北民族是健康的，是勇敢的。过去他们受着阶级的和民族的双重压迫，在艰苦的环境中，他们从来没有停止过英勇的斗争。一位维吾尔的代表告诉我们，他曾经为了争取民族解放被反动派关了四年，受尽了反动派的酷刑、毒打。他被倒悬在梁上用辣子水往鼻子里灌。尽管他的身体受了摧残，但是，在牢狱中，他仍然继续不断地学习马列主义，用指头在地上画字学习汉文。出狱以后，他已能将“大众哲学”译成维文。
    在共产党领导之下，他们对于新中国的建设，尤其是新西北的建设，具有无比的信心，参观团的团长告诉我们，西北有石油等丰富的矿藏，是中国工业化不可少的富源。他们相信自己的力量和相信共产党的领导一样，他们确信在人民政府和共产党领导下，在伟大社会主义苏联的兄弟般的帮助下，在十年之内，一定要在绵亘的沙漠地带，建立起楼房和工厂来。
    对最近签订的中苏经济合作的三协定，他们感到特别兴奋。一位代表说：“苏联这次帮助我们开发西北的油矿，帮我们解决一些我们自己不能解决而且需要立即解决的问题，在今天，这是一个最好的，最有力的帮助，是继续着过去对我们帮助的又一具体表现。”另一位代表说：“玉门有一座油矿，现在因为缺少机器，油不能完全提炼，大部分都流到山沟里去了。现在可好了，有了苏联朋友的帮助，我们就可以很快地建立起工业的基础。我一定努力学习马列主义，努力工作搞好民族团结，以行动来支持这一条约。”
    这些事情，这些言语，在归途的回忆里，给了我们鼓励和教育。在路上，我们热烈地谈论着今天的事情。一位同学说：“我今天才体会到西北建设的光明，祖国建设的光明。中国到处都是富源和勇敢的人民。”
    老李说：“当我们提出了我们毕业之后，愿意到西北去工作的时候，他们是多么热情的欢呼。一次又一次的鼓掌，表示他们真诚的欢迎。这使我感到我站在中国的每一个地方，都象是站在自己的家里一样。”
    “加强我们的学习！”有谁在前面高声地喊：“用我们实际工作成绩，来报答他们的盛意。”
