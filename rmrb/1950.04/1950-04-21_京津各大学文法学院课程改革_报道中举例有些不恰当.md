Title: Examples Used in "Report on Curriculum Reform in Liberal Arts Colleges of Beijing and Tianjin Universities" Are Inappropriate

To the Editor:

　　Regarding the news report on curriculum reform in liberal arts colleges of Beijing and Tianjin universities in your newspaper on April 2nd, there was a statement such as, "For example, the Literary Theory course offered by the Department of Western Languages at Peking University 'explains the entire organic figure formed by British and American literary theories,' but in reality, it still discusses British and American bourgeois literary theories, which does not match the listed name." As the Literary Theory course in the Department of Western Languages at Peking University is taught by me, I indeed use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints as the foundation for teaching this course, with the aim of enabling students to use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to critique British and American literary works and theories. Teaching has progressed beyond the halfway point. I hope your newspaper will reinvestigate this matter.

        With best regards,
            Qian Xuexi, English Section, Department of Western Languages, Peking University

### “京津各大学文法学院课程改革”报道中举例有些不恰当

　　“京津各大学文法学院课程改革”报道中举例有些不恰当编辑同志：
    读贵报四月二日京津各大学文法学院课程改革消息，有“如北大西语系所开文艺学说是‘阐明英美文艺理论所构成的整个有机图形’，实则仍是讲述英美资产文艺理论，与所列名称不相符合”等语。按北大西语系文艺学是本人所授，本人确以马列主义观点为讲授此课之基础，而以使同学能用马列观点批判英美文艺作品文艺理论为目的。讲授以来，已逾全程之半。希贵报再行调查为荷
        此致敬礼            北大西语系英文组  钱学熙谨启
                                  四月五日
