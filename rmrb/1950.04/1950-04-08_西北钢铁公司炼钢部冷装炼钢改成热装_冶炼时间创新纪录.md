　　Northwest Steel Company Steelmaking Department Changes Cold Charging to Hot Charging; Smelting Time Sets New Record

　　[This Newspaper News] In the Northwest Steel Company's management democratization movement, the Steelmaking Department, under the guidance of Soviet experts and with the active efforts of the workers, following the Coking Department's reduction of ash content, created the factory's highest record for cold charging steelmaking and achieved successful hot charging. They also shortened the smelting time to an unprecedented new record of five hours and fifty-five minutes, providing a strong guarantee for this year's arduous production tasks. The Preparatory Group of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry awarded 5,000 catties of millet as a special prize.

　　On March 22nd, the workers of the two open-hearth furnaces in the Steelmaking Department carefully operated and worked hard, creating a new record of 50% higher production than the average in February with excellent quality under cold charging conditions. The two furnaces produced a total of 5.75 heats of steel, with an average smelting time of eight hours and twenty minutes, a 24% improvement over the average smelting time in February.

　　In order to further shorten the smelting time and increase steel production, under the advanced technical guidance of Soviet expert Mr. Gililov, after experimentation and improved charging operations, on the 23rd of last month, Open-hearth Furnaces No. 1 and No. 2 were officially changed from cold charging to hot charging. The workers of both furnaces launched a heated competition. The Tong Qigui team of Furnace No. 2, in the 2.246 heats, created a new record of producing one heat of steel in six hours, a 10% improvement over the average at the beginning of hot charging. The entire day, including five hours of hot repairs, produced a total of 5.5 heats of steel.

　　On the 24th, the Wang Yu team of Furnace No. 1, in the 429th heat, broke through six hours and created a peak record of five hours and fifty-five minutes, a much greater improvement than the highest cold charging record of seven hours and forty-three minutes on November 25th of last year. The entire day, including twelve hours and fifty minutes of hot repairs, produced a total of 5.1 heats of steel.

　　西北钢铁公司炼钢部冷装炼钢改成热装  冶炼时间创新纪录
    【本报讯】西北钢铁公司在开展管理民主化运动中，炼钢部在苏联专家指导之下，经工友们积极努力，继炼焦部降低灰分之后，创造了该厂冷装炼钢的最高纪录和热装成功，并缩短冶炼时间为五小时五十五分的空前新纪录，为今年艰巨的生产任务提供了有力的保证。中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局筹备组特奖给小米五千斤。
    三月二十二日炼钢部两个平炉的工友细心操作，努力加油，在冷装的条件下创造了比二月份平均产量提高百分之五十而质量优良的新纪录。两个炉子共出钢五·七五次，平均每次冶炼时间为八小时二十分，较二月份平均冶炼时间提高百分之二十四。
    为进一步缩短冶炼时间，增加出钢产量，在苏联专家吉利好夫先进技术指导下，经过试验，改进装炉操作后，于上月二十三日，一、二号平炉均正式改冷装为热装，两炉工友并展开热烈竞赛。二号平炉童其贵班在二、二四六次冶炼中，创造了六小时出一炉钢的新纪录，较开始热装平均提高百分之十，全日包括五小时的热修理在内，共出钢五·五次。
    二十四日，一号平炉王瑜班，在四二九次冶炼中，突破六小时而创造了五小时五十五分的最高纪录，较去年十一月二十五日冷装最高纪录的七小时四十三分更大大提高，全日包括十二时五十分的热修理在内，共出钢五·一次。
