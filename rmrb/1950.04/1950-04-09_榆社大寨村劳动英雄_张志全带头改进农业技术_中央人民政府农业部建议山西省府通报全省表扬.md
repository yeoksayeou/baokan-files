	Leads the Way in Improving Agricultural Technology
	Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government Suggests that Shanxi Provincial Government Issue a Province-Wide Commendation
	[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Zhiqquan, a labor hero from Dazhai Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, promoted and demonstrated improved agricultural techniques, especially seed soaking and selection, leading the entire village and playing a significant role in increasing production. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has specifically suggested to the Shanxi Provincial People's Government that Comrade Zhang Zhiqquan be commended province-wide and that his experience and effectiveness in promoting agricultural technology be widely publicized and introduced. Comrade Zhang Zhiqquan is a member of the Chinese Communist Party branch in Dazhai Village. In the past, when he promoted improved techniques to the masses, it was difficult for them to accept due to conservative thinking. For example, when he called for "hoeing millet when it's an inch high," some people said, "Hoeing millet when it's an inch high will cause 'umbilical wind' (disease)." When he called for "plowing stubble in autumn," some people said, "Plowing the stubble field in autumn will prevent beans from forming next year." Last year, Comrade Zhang Zhiqquan not only called for it, but also personally experimented in public. When the millet seedlings grew to be an inch high, he led the mutual aid team to hoe his own field first. As a result, not only did it not cause "umbilical wind," but the seedlings grew even more vigorously. This concrete fact had a great impact on the masses. At the same time, three mass field visits were held last year to conduct on-the-spot inspections and comparisons. Each time, the masses were educated with their own experience. For example, Zhang Zhiqquan and Zhang Buyuan had two plots of millet, one above and one below the dam, with similar growing conditions. Zhang Zhiqquan's "811" millet was soaked in warm water before planting, resulting in uniform seedlings and full ridges; Buyuan's was not soaked, and it took three plantings for the seedlings to emerge, resulting in uneven growth. Other people's millet developed smut and rotten cores, but none of Zhang Zhiqquan's soaked seeds were infected. Zhang Yuwen harvested 3.8 *shi* of beans from three *mu* of bean fields where the millet stubble had been plowed in the autumn of 1948; Zhang Nianhai, who did not plow the stubble, only harvested 1.8 *shi*. These facts eliminated the conservative thinking of the masses, made them deeply aware that improved technology could produce more grain, and established a foundation for the masses to trust the leadership and trust science and technology. In addition, the CCP branch also coordinated with the farming season, timely put forward slogans, or mobilized the masses to collectively create new agricultural proverbs, such as: "Hoe millet an inch high, topdressing it with manure." "In a drought, hoeing millet requires surrounding the base with soil; in waterlogging, hoeing millet requires shallow hoeing. First hoeing shallow, second hoeing flat, third hoeing to form a round mound. If you do this, every grain will be full and uniform." "Lightly press the gourds (zucchini), heavily press the melons, prune the branches and vines to eliminate empty flowers, and then you can grow big pumpkins."
	As a result of Comrade Zhang Zhiqquan's active leadership, considerable results have been achieved in technical improvement in the past year. Last spring, he was the only one who implemented warm water soaking of seeds. By the time wheat was planted in the fall, 119 *mu* out of 122 *mu* of wheat fields in the entire village (natural village) had implemented warm water soaking. In addition, 33 households carried out red alum seed dressing. Field selection of seeds was generally carried out in both autumn and summer seasons. Wheat seeds were selected by plot, hand-picked, and wind-selected. Hoeing was also mostly done when the "millet was an inch high." The entire village hoeed 140 *mu* of millet fields four times, 594 *mu* three times, and 10 *mu* twice. In the past, only melons and vegetables were topdressed with fertilizer, but last year, in addition to all melons and vegetables being topdressed, two-thirds of the corn was also topdressed. In addition, 13 *mu* of "811" millet and 6.8 *mu* of Baiyang corn were promoted, and "169" wheat was trialed. Soil was improved on 65 *mu* of land by replacing the soil. In addition, root extract of *洋桃* [unidentified fruit] and tobacco stem water were sprayed to completely eliminate the "oil drought" (a type of plant disease) pests on 40 *mu* of wheat fields.

　　榆社大寨村劳动英雄
    张志全带头改进农业技术     
    中央人民政府农业部建议山西省府通报全省表扬
    【本报讯】山西省榆社县大寨村劳动英雄张志全，宣传并示范带动改进农业技术，特别是浸种选种，一人带动全村，在增产上起了很大作用。中央人民政府农业部特向山西省人民政府建议，向全省通报表扬张志全同志，并把它推广农业技术的经验和效果，广为宣传介绍。张志全同志是大寨村中共支部委员。他过去向群众宣传改良技术，由于群众中存在保守思想，很难接受。比如号召“谷锄寸”，有些人便说：“谷锄寸，中脐风”。号召“秋垡地”，有些人便说“秋天耕了谷茬地，下年不结豆子。”去年，张志全同志一面号召，一面亲自当众试验。当谷苗长出有一寸时，他便领着互助组先锄了自己的，结果不但没中脐风，而且苗长得更旺盛。这个具体事实，在群众中发生了很大影响。同时，去年在群众中举行了三次群众性的田间参观，实地检查比较。每一次都用群众亲手做的经验教育了群众。比如张志全和张补元堰上堰下的两块谷，耕作条件差不多，志全的“八一一”谷经过温汤浸种，就苗齐垅满；补元没经浸种，种了三次才出来，谷苗七高八低。别人的谷起了乌霉芦心，志全浸种的谷没有一棵染病。张玉文在一九四八年秋天垡了谷茬的三亩豆子，打了三石八斗；张碾孩未垡谷茬，却只打了一石八斗。这种种事实使群众扫除了保守思想，深切的认识了改良技术可以多打粮食，并树立起群众信任领导和信任科学技术的基础。此外，中共支部并配合农事季节，适时提出口号，或发动群众集体创作新农谚，如：“谷挽寸，顶上粪。”“天旱挽谷要围土；水涝挽谷要浅锄。头锄浅，二锄平，三锄要上圆蓬蓬。只要这样做，颗颗饱满籽儿匀。”“轻压葫芦（西葫芦），重压瓜，打净枝秧打空花，才能结下大南瓜。”
    该村经张志全同志积极带头的结果，一年来在技术改良上已收到相当的效果。去年春，还仅有他一个人实行了温汤浸种。到秋天种麦时，全村（自然村）一百二十二亩麦田，就有一百一十九亩实行了温汤浸种。并有三十三户进行了红矾拌种。秋夏两季普遍进行了田间选种。麦种做到了片选、拣选和风选。锄苗也大部做到“谷挽寸”。全村锄了四遍的谷地一百四十亩，三遍的五百九十四亩，二遍的十亩。往年只有瓜菜才上追肥，去年除瓜菜全部上了追肥外，三分之二的玉茭也都上了追肥。此外，推广了“八一一”谷十三亩，白洋玉茭六亩八分，试种了“一六九”小麦。六十五亩地以换土办法改良了土壤。并喷洒洋桃根烟杆水，全部扑灭了四十亩麦地的“油旱”害虫。
