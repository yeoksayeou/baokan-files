In some districts and villages of Huolu County, Hebei, a tendency towards simply pursuing statistical figures has emerged in the crash cotton planting campaign, which has affected the in-depth development of the cotton planting movement. The County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the county has instructed various districts to correct this. After the cotton planting campaign began, a few district and village cadres did not actively carry out propaganda and mobilization, specifically solve the concerns and difficulties of the masses, but simply asked village cadres and people's representatives from each village for figures to estimate "whether they can complete the task." Some villages have even compiled statistics three times, which has affected the masses' production and increased their concerns. For example, Dun Yuker, a farmer in Yue Village, truthfully reported planting nine mu of cotton in the first two registrations, but when the statistics were compiled for the third time, he became suspicious and said, "Just record three mu for me!" The statistics from Niushan showed three hundred mu less land. Zhu Shunbao and three other households borrowed cotton seeds but did not register for cotton planting. At the same time, the cumbersome and repeated statistics increased the trouble for village cadres and the masses, arousing their dislike. More seriously, a few village and district cadres used these completely inaccurate statistics as the basis for their reports on whether they could complete the task, without conducting in-depth investigations, and blindly became optimistic. They neglected further in-depth mobilization of the masses, directly affecting the further development of the cotton planting movement. After discovering the above deviations, the County Party Committee has convened meetings in various districts to correct them, pointing out that this formalistic approach must be overcome. It emphasized that cadres must go deep among the masses, working from door to door, specifically solving the concerns and difficulties of the masses.

　　河北获鹿部分区村单纯追求种棉数字
    【本报讯】河北获鹿县突击种棉工作中，在部分区村发生单纯统计数字的偏向，而影响种棉运动的深入展开。该县中共县委已分别指示各区纠正中。种棉运动展开后，少数区村干部不积极进行宣传动员，具体解决群众顾虑与困难，而单纯向村干部与各村人民代表要数字，来估计“能不能完成”，部分村甚至已统计了三次，结果影响了群众生产，增加了群众顾虑。如岳村农民敦玉柯在前两次登记时，都实报了种棉九亩，第三次又统计时，发生了怀疑说“给我记上三亩吧！”牛山统计的结果少了三百亩地，朱顺保等三户贷了棉籽都没登种棉。同时，繁琐反复的统计增加了村干部和群众的麻烦，惹引了群众的讨厌。更严重的是少数村区干部以这完全不确实的统计做为汇报材料中能不能完成任务的根据，也不深入调查，而盲目的乐观起来。忽视进一步深入发动群众，直接影响种棉运动的进一步开展。县委发现以上偏向后，已分别在各区召集了会议进行纠正。指出必须克服这种形式主义作法，强调干部必须深入群众挨门挨户具体进行工作，具体的解决群众顾虑与困难。
