Strive to Complete the National Industrial Census
Director of the Statistical Office of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council Di Chaobai

(I) The Purpose of Conducting a National Industrial Census

1.	Holding a nationwide national industrial census is the only way to thoroughly understand the basic situation and internal structure of national industrial and mining enterprises. Only by thoroughly understanding the basic situation and internal structure of national industrial and mining enterprises can we draft national industrial construction plans and correctly determine the work tasks of national regions, localities, and industrial and mining enterprises.

2.	In the past, various industrial and mining enterprises also submitted a lot of statistical materials, and these materials individually helped solve some problems in their work. However, if these materials are used for national comprehensive planning and construction, they are obviously not very useful, because (1) the reporting times of these materials are inconsistent, so we cannot grasp the basic situation of national industrial and mining enterprises at a certain point in time and formulate national restoration and construction plans on an annual basis accordingly. (2) The reporting items of these materials are inconsistent, failing to provide the leadership with the essential materials in a concise and to-the-point manner and to express these materials in a nationally unified scientific format. Therefore, the various basic figures of each unit cannot be comprehensively utilized by various departments, regions, localities, and even the central government. (3) The accounting methods for basic figures of various industrial and mining enterprises are inconsistent, so the contents contained in the same format and the same item are often inconsistent. This not only makes us feel difficult in understanding and comprehensively utilizing the figures, but also shows the confusion in the accounting methods of our national enterprises, which expands the confusion in internal business operations of the enterprises. (4) The materials provided in the past were not only incomplete and not comprehensive, but also not very accurate. In the past, a planned economy was not implemented, so each factory and mine regarded investigation and statistics as a burden, reported things hastily, and some individual units even used statistical figures as a tool to report achievements and make demands to the leadership, unwilling to truthfully reveal their weaknesses. Such materials cannot help solve problems and determine plans, but will mislead the leadership and cause damage to plans.

3.	Because of the above reasons, we have to abandon the past materials and take the end of 1949 as the time point for a national census. This will allow national state-owned industrial and mining enterprises to express their correct basic situation at the same time, using the same format and the same accounting method, so that leaders at all levels can correctly understand the distribution areas of various national enterprises, the production equipment and production capacity of various enterprises, the types and amounts of products produced by various enterprises, the use of raw materials by various enterprises, the technical equipment and labor allocation of various enterprises, the internal relations of various enterprises in various regions, and so on. Based on these materials, we can correctly know what our national industrial and mining enterprises have, what they lack, what they have too much of, what they have too little of, what can be increased in production, what cannot be increased in production, what needs to be restored, and what needs to be built. Mastering these situations, we can draft plans and confidently and step by step begin our comprehensive economic construction.

(II) Why Can't the Census Be Conducted Later?

4.	Some comrades in the enterprise have raised such an opinion, saying that "the industrial and mining enterprises within the customs have not been taken over for long, production is not on track, and the responsible comrades are busy with business and have no energy to engage in this." Is this opinion correct or wrong? It is wrong! Because this opinion only reflects individual situations, not general situations; it only emphasizes the current difficulties, but does not recognize the need to overcome the difficulties; it only asks us to take care of the backwardness of his enterprise, but does not require his enterprise to learn from advanced enterprises.

5.	At present, the military has basically ended on the mainland of the country, and the economic recovery work in the Northeast region has achieved remarkable results. Although the liberation times of various regions within the customs are different, the regions that were liberated later must catch up quickly and learn from the regions that were liberated earlier. The period when economic construction has become the main task of our revolution has begun, and the formulation of a national economic construction plan is imminent. Delaying the national industrial and mining census will delay the formulation of economic plans and slow down the development of industry and mining, which will cause great losses. Therefore, we must race against time and complete the census of national state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and cooperative industrial production throughout the country before September of this year.

(III) Are There Difficulties? Are the Difficulties Absolute?

6.	According to the forms prescribed for this census, will it be difficult for national state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and industrial production cooperatives to complete the filling in the shortest possible time? There must be difficulties. Difficulties may be due to the lack of statistical cadres, difficulties may be due to incomplete usual records, difficulties may be due to the overly complex organization of large enterprises, complaining that the forms are too simplified; conversely, it may also be due to the overly simple organization of small enterprises, complaining that the forms are too complex; it is even more possible that some special circumstances of the factory and mine cannot be fully adapted to the requirements of the forms, and they feel tricky.

7.	However, all these difficulties are not insurmountable. The enterprises we control are relatively modern enterprises, with scientific division of labor and a certain organization. Therefore, whether it is the dynamic or static situation of the enterprise, there will be original records and preliminary accounting. Now we ask the heads of various industrial and mining enterprises to organize for the completion of this census, so that every part of the factory and mine has appropriate cadres to participate in this organization, first conduct learning, understand the contents of the form items and instructions, hold meetings to discuss and specifically grasp every step and every link of the filling work, then reasonably divide the work, and have full-time personnel lead the work. The leaders of the factory and mine must provide these staff with the necessary working conditions and working convenience. As long as we can organize, learn, and work conscientiously in a planned manner, the above difficulties will be overcome one by one.

8.	In factories and mines where production is on track, the work will be easier, and in factories and mines where production has not yet entered the right track, the work will be more difficult. However, precisely because production has not yet entered the right track, it is especially necessary to sort out its basic situation clearly. After such a census and cleanup, although it will temporarily allocate part of the manpower and affect production more or less, in terms of its consequences, it will help the normalization of the enterprise and the establishment of the accounting system, and it will help the future production.

9.	When we formulated the forms, we have tried our best to take care of the difficulties of some factories and mines, so some of the more difficult items to fill in: we only require the possible figures to be filled in, and these items have been noted in the instructions. However, the heads of various factories and mines should still do their best to complete the requirements that they can achieve. The census is not held regularly. General countries need to hold it once every five or ten years. Therefore, since we have mobilized such a large amount of human and material resources to carry out this work, we must do everything possible to overcome the difficulties and ensure the greatest achievement of this work.

(IV) Prepare Conditions for the Formulation of National Economic Plans

10.	The responsible comrades and staff comrades of our national industrial and mining enterprises have always been happy to take on tasks and are good at overcoming difficulties. The Central Finance and Economics Committee calls on all comrades in our national enterprises to "work hard to overcome difficulties and complete this arduous task." Comrades at all levels will definitely respond to this call, just as they have responded to various calls from the government in the past, and use their best efforts to successfully complete the census tasks assigned by the leadership.

11.	The Central People's Government is eagerly waiting for national enterprises to provide complete and accurate materials to draft short-term and long-term economic construction plans. Our economic plans will always be the plans of the masses, and it is necessary to gather the strength and wisdom of the masses to formulate and implement them. In this sense, this national industrial and mining enterprise census is to mobilize forces and begin to prepare the necessary conditions for the formulation of economic plans.

　　努力完成国家工业的普查工作
    政务院财政经济委员会统计处处长  狄超白
    （一）举行国家工业普查的目的
    一、举办全国性的国家工业普查，是彻底了解国家工矿企业的基本情况及其内部结构的唯一办法。只有彻底了解了国家工矿企业的基本情况及其内部结构，我们才能草拟国家工业的建设计划，才能正确决定全国各区各地各工矿企业单位的工作任务。
    二、过去各工矿企业单位，也曾呈报了不少统计材料，这些材料也曾个别的帮助解决了工作上的一些问题。但这些材料如供给国家全面的计划建设来用的话，显然是没有多大用处的，因为（１）这些材料的填报时间是先后不一致的，使我们不能在某一时间点上掌握全国工矿企业的基本情况，并据此订出以年度为单位的全国性的恢复和建设计划来。（２）这些材料的填报项目是互不一致的，没有能够精简扼要地供给领导上所必须知道的材料，并把这些材料在全国一致的科学的表式上表达出来，因此，不能使各主管部门各区各地以至中央可以把各单位的各种基本数字加以综合。（３）各工矿企业对于基本数字的核算方法是互不一致的，因此在同一表式和同一项目中所包含的内容往往互不一致，这不仅使得我们在了解和综合方面感觉到困难，而且表现了我们国家企业在核算方法上的混乱，并由此而扩大了企业内部业务上的混乱。（４）过去所供给的材料非但不完整，不全面，而且不很正确。过去没有实行过计划经济，因此各厂矿把调查统计当作是一种负担，草草率率，呈报了事，甚至有个别单位把统计数字作为向领导上报成绩提要求的工具，不愿意忠实表露自己的弱点，这样的材料非但不能帮助解决问题确定计划，而且会陷领导上造成错误破坏计划。
    三、因有上述原因，所以我们不能不放弃过去的材料，而采取以一九四九年底为时间点来进行全国普查。使全国国营的工矿企业在同一时间用同一表式和同一的核算方法表达其正确的基本情况，使各级领导机构能够正确了解国家各种企业的分布地区，各种企业的生产设备及其生产能力，各种企业的生产品种类及其数额，各种企业原料材料的使用情况，各种企业的技术配备及劳动力配备，各个地区各种企业内部的相互关系等等；根据这些材料，我们就能正确知道国家工矿企业中有的是什么？没有的是什么？多的是什么？少的是什么？能增产的是什么？不能增产的是什么？需要恢复的是什么？需要建设的是什么？掌握了这些情况，我们就能草拟计划，就能有把握有步骤地开始我们全面的经济建设。
            （二）为什么不能再迟一些时候进行普查
    四、有些企业的工作同志提过这样的意见，说是“关内各工矿企业接收不久，生产没有上轨道，负责同志忙于业务，没有余力来搞这个东西。”这种意见是对的呢还是错误的呢？是错误的！因为这种意见只是反映个别的情况，而不是反映一般的情况；只是强调目前的困难，而没有认识克服困难的必要；只是要求我们照顾他的企业的落后，没有要求他的企业要向先进的企业看齐。
    五、目前全国大陆上军事已经基本结束，东北区经济恢复工作已著有成绩。关内各地虽解放时期有先后的不同，但后解放的地区必须急起直追，向先解放的地区看齐。经济建设成为我们革命的主要任务的时期已经开始，制订全国性的经济建设计划已刻不容缓。延缓了国家工矿业的普查，就会延缓经济计划的制订，就会延缓工矿业发展的速度，其损失是很大的，所以我们必须争取时间，于本年九月以前办好全国国家工矿企业及合作社工业生产的普查工作。
            （三）有没有困难？困难是不是绝对的？
    六、依照此次普查所规定的表格，要求全国国营工矿企业及工业生产的合作社于最短期内完成填报工作，会不会发生一些困难呢？困难一定是会有的。困难可能由于统计干部的缺乏，困难可能由于平时纪录的残缺，困难可能由于大企业组织机构的过于复杂，嫌表式太简化了；相反的也可能由于小企业组织机构的过于简单，嫌表式太复杂了；更有可能由于厂矿某些特殊情况与表式的要求不能完全适应而感到棘手。
    七、但是所有这些困难，并不是不能克服的，我们国家所掌握的企业，都是比较现代化的企业，有科学的分工，有一定的组织，因此无论是企业动态的情况或静态的情况，都会有原始的纪录和初步的核算。现在我们要求各工矿企业的负责人，为完成这次普查工作而进行一次组织，使厂矿的每一部分都有适当的干部来参加这一组织，先进行学习，了解表格项目和说明书的内容，要开会讨论，具体掌握进行填报工作的每一步骤和每一环节，然后合理的分工，并有专职的人员领导这一工作的进行，厂矿的负责人并须给予这些工作人员以必要的工作条件和工作便利。我们只要能进行组织，进行学习，有计划地认真工作，上述那些困难都会一一克服的。
    八、在生产已上正轨的厂矿，工作会进行得省力些，在生产还未步入正轨的厂矿，工作会进行得比较吃力些，但是正因为生产尚未步入正轨，就尤其需要把自己的基本情况整理清楚，经过这样一次普查的清理，虽然暂时间要分用一部分人力，或多或少影响着生产，但就其后果来说。将有助于企业的正轨化和核算制度的建立，并有助于今后生产的进行。
    九、我们在制定表格的时候，已尽可能地照顾到一部分厂矿的困难，所以有些比较难填的项目：只是要求可能填报的数字，这些项目在说明书上已注明了。不过各厂矿的负责人仍应尽其可能，完成其可能达到的要求。普查并不是经常举行的，一般的国家都需要五年或十年才举行一次。所以我们既然动员这样大的人力和物力来进行这一工作，我们就得尽一切力量去战胜困难，保证这一工作的最大成就。
            （四）为制订全国性的经济计划准备条件
    十、我们国家工矿企业的负责同志及职工同志，一向是乐于负担任务，并善于克服困难的。中央财经委员会号召我们国家企业的全体同志，“努力克服困难，完成此艰巨任务”，各级同志一定会响应这一号召，一如过去响应政府的各种号召一样，用最大的努力，胜利地完成领导上所交给的普查任务。
    十一、中央人民政府迫切等待着国家企业提供完整而正确的材料，来草拟短期的和长期的经济建设计划，我们的经济计划将永远是群众的计划，是要集合群众的力量和智慧来制订和实施的。在这个意义上，这次国家工矿企业的普查工作，就是要动员力量，开始为制订经济计划准备必需的条件。
