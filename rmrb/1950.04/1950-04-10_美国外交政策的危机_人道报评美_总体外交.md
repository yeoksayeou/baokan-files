Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 9th: A late dispatch from Paris: L'Humanité published an article on March 25th by the famous French political commentator, Gourtart, entitled "The Crisis in U.S. Foreign Policy," commenting on the so-called "total diplomacy" recently proposed by Acheson, stating: "'Total diplomacy' is essentially a policy of permanent intervention, a policy of U.S. imperialist agents around the world carrying out conspiracies under the guise of diplomacy. The U.S. embassy in any country has now degenerated into a command post for espionage and sabotage, and in protectorates and satellite states, it has simply become the ruling organ. James Burnham, a Trotskyite who defined the general line of the State Department's "world hegemony" policy, shamelessly stated: Total diplomacy disregards all treaties and uses conspiracies, bribery, and terror to undermine the independence of the countries it wants to invade. This is already manifested in the provocations, the meetings of the chiefs of staff, the deployment of fleets, Sherman's visit to London, the large-scale transfer of armaments, and the intensified oppression of the working class in satellite countries and the fascistization of the United States itself. However, the offensive of 'total diplomacy' is not all smooth sailing, but is partly used to cover up their confusion. After listing the failures of the United States in China, the internal divisions of the Atlantic group, the loss of the atomic 'privilege,' etc., the American commentator Lippmann said: 'We are saying more than we are doing. We have been forced to maneuver in the adverse currents and reactions of the world stage—this is painful and embarrassing.' Intensified aggression and expanding weaknesses are the contradictions of American policy. But the confusion of the war groups may also lead them to take risks. Eisenhower declared on March 23 that he would rather 'risk a devastating war' than seek peace that would mean abandoning American 'ideas.' Therefore, the people have never been more in need of united action to strive for a peace won through uncompromising negotiations, a peace won through the continuous strengthening of the peace camp."

### 美国外交政策的危机  人道报评美“总体外交”

　　美国外交政策的危机
    人道报评美“总体外交”
    【新华社布拉格九日电】巴黎迟到消息：人道报三月二十五日发表法国名政论家古尔塔特所撰《美国外交政策的危机》一文，评论最近艾奇逊提出的所谓“总体外交”称：“总体外交”实质上就是永久干涉的政策，就是全世界的美帝国主义代理人在外交的掩护下实行阴谋的政策。现在美国驻在任何国家的使馆，都已蜕化为间谍和破坏的司令台，而在保护国和卫星国内，就索性成了统治机关。给国务院确定“世界霸政”政策总路线的托洛茨基分子詹姆士·白恩汉毫不掩饰地说：总体外交无视一切条约，并且以阴谋、贿赂和恐怖去破坏它想侵入的国家的独立。这已表现在挑衅者的言论、参谋长们的会议、舰队的调动、薛尔曼之访问伦敦、大规模军火输送，以及卫星国政府加紧压迫工人阶级和美国本身法西斯化的发展上。然而，“总体外交”的攻势并非万事如意，而是部分地用来掩盖他们的混乱的。美国评论家李普曼在列举了美国在中国的失败、大西洋集团的内部分歧、原子“特权”的丧失等等之后说：“我们说的超过了我们的行动。我们已被迫周旋于世界舞台的逆浪与反动之中——这是痛苦和难堪的。”加紧侵略，同时弱点扩大，这就是美国政策的矛盾。但战争集团的混乱也可能使它们冒险。艾森豪威尔三月二十三日宣称，他宁愿“冒一个毁灭性战争的危险”，而不愿谋求意味着放弃美国“思想”的和平。因此人民从没有更像现在这样，必须以一致行动去争取一个毫不妥协的谈判得来的和平，一个和平阵营的不断增强而得来的和平。
