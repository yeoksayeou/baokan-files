　　[This Newspaper News] After a month of hard work, the teachers and students of Municipal No. 1 Middle School have happily harvested their first batch of vegetables - 4,000 jin of spinach and some scallions. These vegetables were sold at lower prices within the school, and were sold out in a few hours. In the past month, the school mobilized 500 teachers and students to participate in production. After cultivating the land, loosening the soil, and making ridges, they have now planted five mu of small red radishes, one mu of Chinese cabbage, eight mu of hyacinth beans, spinach, and scallions. They are now preparing to plant tomatoes and cabbage. On April 2nd, they installed waterwheels, and the students who went to production that day were very excited, watering more than 50 ridges of spinach in one day.

　　Since the school started production, it has gradually improved shortcomings in labor organization, labor discipline, and the use and maintenance of production tools. For example, initially, the Production Committee did not organize the students well, and the notice of who should participate in production each day was very late, so the students were not prepared in advance, and the departure was very late. Now, the schedule for three weeks has been arranged, and the students' studies have been properly taken care of. Ten people participate in labor every day, and each person goes once every five weeks on average. They can leave at 7:30 every day and return to school at 6:00 in the afternoon. When working, students with weak physical strength are responsible for boiling water and heating lunch. Everyone eats on time and works on time. The work is also very organized, and some recreational activities are carried out during breaks to recover from fatigue.

　　Initially, the students did not know how to use agricultural tools and did not take good care of them, and some were damaged. Later, the Production Committee called on students to take care of agricultural tools. In the group, those who knew how to use them helped those who did not, and experienced workers were invited to provide specific guidance. The farm covenant also stipulated that students should obey the guidance of the workers. In this way, the damage to agricultural tools has been greatly reduced. At the beginning, due to the lack of good labor discipline, students trampled on the farmers' wheat fields at will and urinated everywhere, which was criticized by the villagers. After the farm covenant was made, it has gradually changed. The relationship with the villagers has also gradually improved. (Correspondence Group of No. 1 Middle School)

　　市立一中生产有进步  首批收获菠菜四千斤
    【本报讯】市立一中的生产经一个月的辛勤劳动，师生们已高兴地收获了第一批蔬菜——菠菜四千斤及小葱一部。这些菜蔬以较低的价格在校内出售，几个钟头就卖光了。该校一月来动员了五百师生参加生产，经耕地、松土，作畦，现已种上五亩小红萝卜，一亩小白菜，八亩扁豆及菠菜、小葱等，现正准备种西红柿和洋白菜。他们在四月二日已装上水车，当天去生产的同学都很兴奋，一天浇了五十多畦菠菜。
    该校自生产以来，逐步改进劳动组织、劳动纪律、生产工具的使用与爱护等方面的缺点。如最初生产委员会对同学组织不好，对每天应当参加生产的人通知很晚，以致事先同学的准备不够，出发很晚。现在已将三周的日程排好，并适当地照顾了同学的功课，每天有十个人参加劳动，平均一人五周去一次。每天七点半就可以出发，下午六点回校。工作时由体力弱的同学担任烧水、热午饭等工作。大家按时吃饭，按时劳动。劳动时也很有组织，休息时还搞些文娱活动，以恢复疲劳。
    最初同学对农具不会使用，也不够爱护，曾损坏了一部分。后来生产委员会号召同学爱护农具，在小组内由会用的帮助不会的，并请有生产经验的工友具体指导，并在农场公约中规定同学要服从工友的指导，这样，农具的损坏已大大减少。开始因没很好的劳动纪律，同学有在地里随便践踏农民的麦田及随地便溺等情形，受到老乡的批评。订了农场公约后，已逐渐改变。和老乡的关系也渐渐好了。（一中通讯组）
