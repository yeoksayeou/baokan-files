Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 24th -- Since last winter, the people's governments of various provinces in the Central South region have distributed over 300 million jin of various production loans in grain, implementing work-for-relief programs, and organizing impoverished working people in various regions to engage in various production and construction works such as repairing river embankments and transportation. The Hunan Provincial People's Government has successively issued over 44 million jin of grain for loans, mobilizing over 200,000 laborers from the Dongting Lake area to participate in repairing the lake dikes and the flood storage and reclamation project of Datong Lake, solving the livelihood difficulties of 500,000 impoverished farmers; at the same time, it has guaranteed the recovery of local agricultural production. It is estimated that the Datong Lake flood storage and reclamation area alone can increase grain production by over 130 million jin compared to last year. In Hubei Province, as a result of implementing work-for-relief programs, 2.4 million of the 3 million disaster victims in the province's flood-stricken areas can solve one to two months of livelihood difficulties. In Mianyang County alone, 100,000 people participate in dike repair every day; on average, each person can carry one to two cubic meters of soil per day and earn four to eight jin of rice as wages. Over 80 percent of the disaster victims who fled the severely affected areas of the province have returned to their homes to participate in various production activities. In Jiangxi Province, due to the people's government's issuance of large sums of money for work-for-relief programs to repair dikes around Poyang Lake, a large number of laborers participated in dike repair. In Poyang County, the number of people working on the dikes increased from only 15,000 per day in February to over 50,000 in early March. As a result, the county completed the project of repairing thousands of miles of dikes half a month ahead of schedule. In Henan Province, the spring repair project on the Yellow River in Lanfeng County solved the livelihood difficulties of over 20,000 people in the stone material transportation project alone.

　　中南发放生产贷粮三亿斤
    解决了贫民生活，兴修了水利等工程
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】中南区各省人民政府自去冬以来，发放各种生产贷粮三亿余斤，实行以工代赈，组织各地贫苦劳动人民进行修筑河堤、运输等各种生产和建设工作。湖南省人民政府先后发放贷粮四千四百余万斤，发动洞庭湖滨湖二十余万民工参加修该湖堤防及大通湖的蓄洪垦植工程，解决了五十万贫苦农民的生活困难；同时并保证了当地农业生产的恢复。据估计仅大通湖蓄洪垦植区一地，即可比去年增产粮食一亿三千余万斤。湖北省由于实行以工代赈的结果，全省水灾区的三百万灾民中，已有二百四十万灾民可解决一个月到两个月的生活困难。仅沔阳一县，每天就有十万人参加修堤；平均每人每日挑土一方到两方，可得工资米四斤到八斤。该省重灾地区逃荒外出的灾民，已有百分之八十以上重返家园，参加各种生产。江西省鄱阳湖周围各县，由于人民政府发放巨款以工代赈进行修堤，大批民工参加修堤。鄱阳县在二月间每日仅一万五千人上堤工作，至三月上旬已增至五万余人。该县复修千里圩堤的工程，因而提前半个月完成。河南省兰封县黄河春修工程仅包运石料一项，即解决了二万余人的生活困难。
