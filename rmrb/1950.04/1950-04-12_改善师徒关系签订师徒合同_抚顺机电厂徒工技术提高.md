　　Improving Master-Apprentice Relations Through Signing Master-Apprentice Contracts
    Fushun Machine and Electrical Plant Apprentices' Technical Skills Improve

    [Report from this newspaper] The Fushun Machine and Electrical Plant signed master-apprentice contracts, improved master-apprentice relationships, and rapidly improved apprentice technical skills. Apprentices in the plant account for 29 percent of all employees, and together with ordinary workers, they account for 41.8 percent of the total number of employees. In order to complete major production tasks, under the leadership of the New Democratic Youth League, the plant signed master-apprentice contracts. Because masters taught earnestly and apprentices studied diligently, the technical progress of apprentices was extremely rapid. For example, sand mold apprentices Zhou Tiemin and Zhuang Zhenshan from the iron foundry reached the level of a grade 1.3 technician after less than two months of signing the contract, according to an exam on the 23rd of last month. The bullhead planer class in the machine shop signed a four-month contract, but in less than two months, three of the four apprentices were able to independently operate the machines. Technician Liu Dalong said, "During the puppet Manchuria period, I studied technology for more than a year before I reached their current level." Apprentice Zheng Peitian was able to make steel tiles, cast iron tiles, and plane surfaces in two months. Without signing a contract, it would take more than half a year to learn these skills. Because of the promotion of the respecting teachers and loving apprentices movement, the old feudal relationship between masters and apprentices and the master's technical conservatism have been changed, and the master-apprentice relationship is extremely harmonious. Yang Shan, a 62-year-old worker in the factory, took off his clothes and gave them to an apprentice to wear when working the night shift; he even kept apprentices in his home to sleep when it got late, the relationship between master and apprentice was as close as father and son.

    However, at the beginning of the contract signing, masters and even managers had many ideological concerns. Some masters were afraid that apprentices would surpass them and always held back some skills; others were afraid that teaching apprentices would delay their own work; they were afraid that apprentices would damage tools or make mistakes. In response to this situation, in addition to holding master-apprentice seminars, the plant focused on publicity and explanation to eliminate ideological concerns. At the same time, it also stipulated solutions to specific problems: for example, to prevent damage to tools, various types of work technical regulations were formulated, stipulating that apprentices should operate in accordance with the technical regulations; and stipulating that apprentices were only allowed to do rough work, and fine work could not be allowed for apprentices to practice. Then, a method of key breakthroughs was adopted, in which the leaders of the Youth League in the plant first helped the fifth bullhead planer class in the machine shop to sign master-apprentice contracts. The preliminary experience gained was: the content of the contract must be specific and clear, such as what the master teaches, what the apprentice learns, time and teaching steps must be clearly stipulated in order to check. During the formal signing, technicians and apprentices from various workshops are absorbed to participate, so as to learn from experience and promote it universally. With the signing of the contract, the administration should immediately formulate a series of systems and regulations such as technical standards, examination system, and promotion and reward system for new technicians, in order to check and ensure the effective implementation of the contract. At the same time, the Youth League must further strengthen the education of new master-apprentice relations and carry out the movement of model masters and model apprentices.

　　改善师徒关系签订师徒合同
    抚顺机电厂徒工技术提高
    【本报讯】抚顺机电厂签订师徒合同，改善师徒关系，迅速提高了徒工技术。该厂徒工占全部职工的百分之二十九，如连同普通工则占职工总数的百分之四一·八。为完成重大的生产任务，该厂在新民主主义青年团的领导下，分别签订师徒合同后，由于师傅认真教，徒弟努力学，徒工技术进步极快。如铸铁厂砂型徒工周铁民、庄振山订立合同不到两个月，经上月二十三日考试，已达一百三十分技工水平。机器场牛头刨床班订的是四个月合同，不到两个月，四名徒工中已有三名能独立上床子干活，技工刘大龙说：“伪满时我学了一年多技术，才达到他们今天的水平。”徒工郑佩田在两个月中已能作钢瓦、生铁瓦等，并能刨平面的活，如不订立合同，这些活需半年多才能学会。由于开展了尊师爱徒运动，改变了师徒间旧的封建关系和师傅们的技术保守观点，师徒关系极为融洽。该厂六十二岁的老工友杨山，在夜班工作时，曾把自己的衣服脱下来给徒工穿；夜深了还留徒工在自家睡，师徒间如同父子般的亲密。
    但该厂在订立合同之初，师傅以至管理人员都有很多思想顾虑，有的师傅怕徒弟高过自己，总要留一手；有的则怕教徒弟耽误自己的活；怕徒弟损坏工具、做错了活等。针对这种情况，该厂除召开师徒座谈会，着重宣传解释，打消思想顾虑。同时并规定了解决具体问题的办法：如怕损坏工具，就制定出各种工种的技术规程，规定徒弟按技术规程去操作；并规定徒弟只许做粗活，精活不能让徒工实习等。继则采取重点突破的方法，由该厂团的领导同志，首先帮助机器场牛头刨第五班订师徒合同，获得初步经验是：合同内容一定要具体明确，如师傅教会什么，徒工学会什么，都要明确规定时间和教学步骤，以便检查。正式签订时，则吸收各车间技工及徒工参加，借此吸取经验，普遍推行。随着合同的订立，行政上要即时制定新技工的技术标准、考试制、提升奖励制等一系列的制度和规章，以便检查和保证合同的切实执行。与此同时，青年团还须进一步加强新的师徒关系的教育，开展模范师傅和模范徒工的运动。
