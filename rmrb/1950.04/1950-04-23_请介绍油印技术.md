To the Editorial Staff:

　　Recently, I have seen many mimeographed publications and books that are printed very beautifully. Their fonts are the same as those of letterpress printing, the patterns are also very beautiful, and the color registration is also very delicate. I heard that many printed materials in the old liberated areas in the past were mimeographed, and the technology was very good (it was exhibited at the Literary Congress last year). There are also places in Beijing and Tianjin that specialize in mimeographing. We hope that comrades who are proficient in mimeograph work will introduce their techniques and methods to everyone.

　　1. Is there only one type of steel stencil? Is there another type of steel stencil for drawing pictures?

　　2. How many types of styluses are there? What are their names? How are they used?

　　3. How is color registration printed?

　　4. How to mix the ink so that it does not appear oily when printed?

　　5. How to draw patterns and pictures? How to write and make shadows?

　　请介绍油印技术编辑同志：
    最近看到许多油印刊物、书籍，印得非常精美，其字体和铅印的一样，图案也很美观，套色也很精巧。听说过去老解放区许多印刷品都是油印的，技术非常好（去年曾在文代会展览过）。在京、津两地也有专门承印油印品的地方。我们希望精通油印工作的同志们把他们的技术和方法，介绍给大家。
    一、钢版是否只有一种？画图是否有另一种钢板？
    二、铁笔有几种？名称是什么？怎样用法？
    三、套色如何印制？
    四、油墨怎样调制，可使印出不显油质？
    五、如何绘制图案及图画？阴影如何涂写制成？
