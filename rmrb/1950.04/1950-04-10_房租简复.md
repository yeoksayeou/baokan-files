　　Simple Reply Regarding Rent, Editor:
    I have two questions, please answer:
    (1) How much rent should be paid for each room to be considered reasonable? Is it permissible for tenants to refuse to pay rent without reason or with excuses?
    (2) If a dispute arises between a tenant and a landlord regarding rent, how should it be handled?
                                                Wang Zhihui Replies to Wang Zhihui:
    I. According to the Beijing Military Control Commission's Public Notice regarding housing issues in the city, tenants should pay rent as agreed. The amount of rent is to be freely negotiated between the landlord and tenant.
    II. If there is a rent dispute between the landlord and tenant, they can request mediation from the local district office.

　　房租简复编者同志：
    我有两个问题，请答复：
    （一）每间房普通应交多少房租方为合理？房客无故或托故不交房租可以吗？
    （二）房客与房主如因房租而发生纠纷，应如何处理？
                                                王智慧答王智慧：
    一、根据北京市军管会关于本市房屋问题布告，房客应依约缴租，房租多少由主客双方自由议定。
    二、主客间如有房租纠纷，可向当地区公所请求调解。
