Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th: The Northeast provinces are actively promoting improved farm tools and focusing on the trial use of new-style farm tools. This is an important reform in this year's agricultural production and a vital guarantee for completing this year's production increase tasks. Based on the guidelines determined by the agricultural technology promotion conference convened by the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry in January, and considering local production conditions, the provinces have decided to promote seventeen types of improved farm tools that have been tested and proven reliable, totaling over 61,000 pieces, according to local conditions. They will also conduct focused trials of 3,320 pieces of new-style horse-drawn mechanical farm tools in rural areas. Their salient features are that they are lighter, more flexible, and more efficient than old-style farm tools, facilitating intensive cultivation. With the government's promotion, last year, various localities focused on promoting over 2,600 pieces of improved farm tools. Trial use demonstrated a significant effect on improving labor efficiency and increasing production, providing favorable conditions for large-scale promotion this year. In particular, farmers in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces have a relatively solid foundation in using improved farm tools, so these two provinces plan to promote more than 60 percent of the total number of improved farm tools promoted in the entire Northeast this year. Farmers in Heilongjiang province independently researched and created improved farm tools last year, and the provincial government has certified two types of seeders and six types of weeding machines for promotion throughout the province. Using these improved farm tools to cultivate land can save 20 to 30 percent of manpower compared to old farm tools.

	Organizing State-Owned and Private Factories to Manufacture, Selling to Farmers Through Cooperatives

The improved farm tools that various localities plan to promote this year, apart from a portion of the main farm tools distributed to the provinces by the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, are all manufactured by local state-owned and private factories organized by the provincial Departments of Agriculture and Forestry. The improved farm tools produced in various localities are distributed to farmers through agricultural loans provided by banks on one hand, and purchased and ordered in large quantities by local cooperatives and sold directly to farmers on the other. During the promotion, attention is also paid to focusing on key distribution points to create experience, while simultaneously considering a combination of key points and broader areas to expand influence. According to general feedback from areas where promotion has already begun, farmers are extremely welcoming of improved farm tools. In some areas, there is even a phenomenon of supply not meeting demand.

Regarding new-style horse-drawn mechanical farm tools, all are ordered from the Soviet Union. The promotion strategy this year mainly involves demonstration trials on state-run farms and agricultural experiment stations in various provinces. In addition, cooperatives with a better foundation are also experimenting with setting up cultivation stations, renting out complete sets or individual pieces of new-style farm tools to farmers at low prices. Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Songjiang, and Liaoxi provinces plan to establish eighteen such promotion stations and plowing stations for new-style farm tools. The Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the provincial Departments of Agriculture and Forestry have also selected forty mutual aid teams with a relatively good foundation in various localities, providing them with complete sets of new-style farm tools for trial use. Currently, Heilongjiang Province has distributed all 1,020-plus pieces of new-style farm tools, and Liaodong Province has loaned nine sets of new-style farm tools to demonstration farms and trial cultivation stations in seven counties. Songjiang Province has also distributed 634 pieces of new-style farm tools to various counties.

In view of the phenomenon that some farmers in some areas did not know how to use improved farm tools and left them idle during the promotion of improved farm tools last year, governments at all levels are universally emphasizing technical guidance this year. Songjiang Province is currently training cadres with skills in using improved farm tools in stages. After the start of spring plowing, a technical promotion team of more than 400 people will go to various places to provide technical guidance. From December last year to mid-January this year, Heilongjiang Province trained more than 300 machine operators and technical cadres for new-style farm tools. In preparation for large-scale promotion next year, Jilin Province has decided to select 150 village cadres and farmer activists from each county to open long-term training courses, allowing them to study labor at agricultural experiment stations for a year. In addition, some provinces and counties have held exhibitions and workshops on improved farm tools and new-style farm tools, introducing the usage methods in detail.

The large-scale promotion of improved farm tools and the focused trial use of new-style farm tools in the Northeast this year will enable various localities to free up a large number of laborers during the spring plowing and summer hoeing seasons for land reclamation to expand cultivated areas and strengthen flood control and water management. According to statistics from Yushu County, Jilin Province alone, one-third of the county's 3.1 million mu of land will use improved farm tools for weeding this year. Based on the labor required for an average of four hoeing operations per mu (including soil cultivation), 600,000 man-days can be saved compared to previous years for other production, thereby increasing farmers' income.

### 东北推广改良农具  新式马拉机械农具开始在公营农场农事试验场试用

　　东北推广改良农具
    新式马拉机械农具开始在公营农场农事试验场试用
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北各省积极推广改良农具与重点试用新式农具。这是今年农业生产上一项重要的改革，也是完成今年增产任务的重要保证。各省根据东北人民政府农林部一月间召开的农业技术推广会议确定的方针以及当地的生产条件，决定因地制宜地推广经过试验确有把握的改良农具十七种，共六万一千余件，并将以三千三百二十件新式马拉机械农具在农村中有重点地进行试用。它们的显著特点是比旧式农具轻便灵活，效率高，便于精耕细作。在人民政府提倡下，去年各地即曾有重点地推广了改良农具共二千六百余件。试用结果对提高劳动效率增加产量有很大作用，为今年大量推广提供了有利的条件。特别是黑龙江、吉林两省农民使用改良农具已较有基础，故该两省今年计划推广改良农具的数目共占全东北推广总数的百分之六十以上。黑龙江省农民去年自行研究创造出的改良农具，经省人民政府的鉴定，已有两种播种机和六种除草机可在全省范围内推广。用这些改良农具种地，可较旧农具节省百分之二十至三十的人力。
    组织公私营工厂制造  通过合作社卖给农民
    各地今年计划推广的改良农具，除一部分主要的农具由东北人民政府农林部发给各省外，其余皆由各省农林厅组织地方公、私营工厂制造。各地制出之改良农具，一方面由银行通过农业贷款方式发放给农民；另一方面由各地合作社大批采购订制，直接卖给农民。推广中并注意重点发放，创造经验；同时照顾点面结合，以扩大影响。据现已开始推广地区的一般反映，农民对改良农具极为欢迎。有些地区并发生了供不应求的现象。
    关于新式马拉机械农具，全部均自苏联订购，其推广方针今年主要是在各省公营农场、农事试验场示范试用。另外，基础较好的合作社亦试办耕作站，以新式农具的全套或单件低价出租给农民。黑龙江、辽东、松江、辽西四省计划建立此种新式农具的推广站和代耕站达十八处。东北人民政府农林部与各省农林厅还在各地有重点地选择了四十个基础较好的互助组，贷予全套新式农具进行试用。现黑龙江省已将新式农具一千零二十余件全部发完，辽东省的九套新式农具业已贷给七个县的示范农场和试设的耕作站，松江省亦将六百三十四件新式农具发至各县。
    鉴于去年推广改良农具中，有些地区农民不会使用而将改良农具搁置起来的现象，今年各地人民政府普遍重视技术指导工作。松江省现正在分期训练具有使用改良农具技术的干部，在春耕开始后将有一个四百余人的技术推广队分赴各地进行技术指导。黑龙江省自去年十二月至今年一月中旬已训练出新式农具的机手和技术干部三百余人。吉林省为准备明年大量推广工作，决定各县抽调村屯干部和农民积极分子一百五十人，开办长期训练班，以一年时间在农事试验场从劳动中进行学习。此外，有些省、县并举行了改良农具与新式农具展览会和讲习会，详细介绍使用方法。
    今年东北各地改良农具的大量推广与新式农具的重点试用，将使各地在春耕与夏锄期间，得以抽出大批劳动力用于开荒扩大耕地面积和加强防汛治水等工作。仅据吉林省榆树县统计，该县三百一十万亩土地，今年将有三分之一要使用改良农具锄草，每亩平均以锄四遍（包括培土）所需劳力计算，可较往年节省六十万个人工用于其他生产，以增加农民收入。
