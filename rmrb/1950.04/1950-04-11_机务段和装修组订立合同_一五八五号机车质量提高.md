　　Engine Terminal and Repair Team Sign Contract
    Quality of Locomotive No. 1585 Improves
    [Our Dispatch] After the Zhangjiakou Engine Terminal Locomotive No. 1585 signed a contract with Repair Team A, preliminary achievements have been made in improving the quality of the locomotive. Before the contract was signed, the repair team carried out repair work according to the driver's repair ticket. Now, due to the increased sense of responsibility, they can automatically help the driver with repairs and inspections. For example, during the C-check on March 7th, the repair ticket stated that the straight wedge key should be adjusted, but Wang Xilin of the repair team found that simply adjusting the straight wedge key was not enough, and he automatically added a shim. In the past, the leading wheel leg was expanded and only spot-welded, which was not durable. Now, the entire car leg is removed and welded firmly. The locomotive and the repair team also frequently and proactively connect and exchange opinions, so that the quality of the locomotive has been gradually improved.

　　机务段和装修组订立合同
    一五八五号机车质量提高
    【本报讯】张家口机务段一五八五号机车与装修甲组订立合同后，在提高机车质量上已获得初步成绩。未订合同前，装修组是按司机的修理票进行修理工作，现在由于责任心加强，都能自动帮助司机修验。如三月七日丙检时，修理票上写的是调整直楔键，但装修组王锡林发觉只调整直楔键不行，又自动镶上了垫。过去引轮车腿扩，只用电焊焊一点，结果不耐用。现在则把车腿整个卸下来，用电焊焊结实。机车和装修组并经常主动连系，交换意见，使该机车在质量上已逐步提高改善。
