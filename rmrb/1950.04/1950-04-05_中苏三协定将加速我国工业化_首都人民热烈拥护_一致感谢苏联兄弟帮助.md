　　The Sino-Soviet Three Agreements Will Accelerate China's Industrialization
    The People of the Capital Warmly Support
    Unanimously Thank Soviet Brothers for Their Help
    Workers
    [Our Newspaper] The people of the capital from all walks of life continue to express their opinions, wholeheartedly supporting the agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union on the exploitation of petroleum and non-ferrous metals in Xinjiang, and the agreement on the establishment of a civil aviation company. Bai Zhizhao, foreman electrician at the Capital Tram Repair Factory, said: We warmly welcome the Soviet Union's spirit of internationalism in helping our country revitalize its industry. Young worker Hu Zhiyi said: This gives us workers in the new China another good opportunity to learn technology, and we must learn well from the Soviet elder brother. Electric worker Wang Chang欢欣 said: In the future, China's foreign transportation will be more convenient, and airplanes will bring us and the Soviet Union closer together.
    Hu Guang, director of the state-owned Beijing General Machinery Factory, believes: People engaged in industry are well aware of the difficulties in China's industrial construction. If we were to develop Xinjiang's petroleum and non-ferrous metals on our own, given the current technical conditions, it is unknown how much longer it would take. Soviet assistance is very necessary for us. He said: The stipulations in the Sino-Soviet agreements regarding shares and rights are completely in line with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The Soviet Union's investment is the hard work of their working people, and they should receive reasonable compensation in production. We should not exploit our Soviet working brothers with the attitude of landlords.
    Zhao Jinzhang, Yang Lanqing, Wu Zhiguang, Gao Qingyuan and other employees of the Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, expressed their feelings, believing that these three agreements signed between the Soviet Union and us are a great help to the development of our country's industry, transportation, economy, and culture. The expenditure, profit, and personnel management methods stipulated in the agreement are all fair and reasonable.
    Professors
    Xu Deheng, professor of the Department of Political Science at Peking University, said in a statement: Without the great help of the Soviet Union, everything would be very difficult on our road to industrialization. The Soviet Union is an advanced country, and its advanced socialist industrial technology will be a great help to our economic construction.
    Wang Tie'ai, professor of the Department of Law at Peking University, said: The agreements on Sino-Soviet cooperation in the exploitation of petroleum and non-ferrous metals and the civil aviation agreement are an aid of high friendship from socialist countries to us. From the establishment of these three companies, we will undoubtedly learn a lot of technical, scientific, and management experience from the advanced socialist Soviet elder brother. This is also a good opportunity to train our working people's production technology.
    Yuan Hanqing, professor of the Department of Chemistry at Peking University, said: Petroleum and non-ferrous metals themselves are important raw materials for industrialization, and require highly technical conditions to be exploited. The Soviet Union, standing on the great internationalist position, helps us to jointly develop petroleum, non-ferrous metals, and develop civil aviation, which is what we urgently need.
    Lou Bangyan, professor of the Department of Political Science at Peking University, believes: These three agreements are the unfolding of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, and there will be other specific economic cooperation in the future. The genuine economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly a powerful blow to the American imperialists.
    Fan Hong, professor of the Department of Economics at Peking University, said: The signing of these three agreements can undoubtedly help us rapidly develop industrial construction. China is unable to exploit large amounts of petroleum, non-ferrous metals and other resources under existing conditions. Imperialism is blockading us, but the Soviet Union is constantly helping us from a position of high friendship, trying its best to help us develop production and improve our industrial technology.
    Wang Tie'ai, professor of the Department of Political Science, Zhang Longxiang, professor of the Department of Chemistry, and Qian Weichang, professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University, also made statements, believing that the signing of the three agreements is a manifestation of the further development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    Students
    Bao Yingjun of Hebei High School said: China is lacking petroleum and non-ferrous metals to develop industrial construction, and the Soviet Union is helping us overcome these difficulties, which is really thinking of us in every way. Wang Shaoshun said: These three agreements are equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. The Soviet Union is helping us develop urgently needed mineral deposits with high technology, which is of great help to China's industrial development.
    Ji Tiemin, Chen Zhilin and other students of the National Mongolian and Tibetan College pointed out: The Soviet Union's help in searching for, exploring, exploiting and refining petroleum and non-ferrous metals is inseparable from our early realization of industrialization.
    Yue Han, the head of the teaching group of the school, said: China is a country rich in mineral deposits. The reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek has been defeated. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the enthusiastic help of the socialist Soviet Union, China's industrial development will be very rapid.
    Li Zhong of Beijing Municipal Normal School said: The agreement of the Sino-Soviet joint venture to organize three companies is a concrete manifestation of strengthening Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Comparing this matter with the Kuomintang remnants directed by American imperialism wantonly bombing our cities and "blockading" our seaports, this is such a strong contrast!
    Shi Wenbing of Beijing Private Normal School wrote to this newspaper expressing his opinion on the Sino-Soviet joint venture to organize three companies, saying: "The agreement on Sino-Soviet joint venture to establish three companies has made Sino-Soviet economic cooperation more concrete. This proves how close the relationship between brotherly countries is, and once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's 'leaning to one side' policy. We not only welcome but also warmly support these agreements."

　　中苏三协定将加速我国工业化
    首都人民热烈拥护
    一致感谢苏联兄弟帮助
    工人
    【本报讯】首都各界人民继续发表意见，衷心拥护中苏签订开采新疆石油、有色金属的协定和设立民航公司的协定。首都电车修造厂电工领班白志钊说：苏联发挥国际主义的精神，帮助我国振兴工业我们十分欢迎。青年工人胡志颐说：这又给我们新中国工人添了一个学习技术的好机会，我们要向苏联老大哥好好学习。电业工人王昶欢欣地说：以后中国对外交通更加方便了，飞机将使我们和苏联之间更加密切起来。
    国营北京机器总厂厂长胡光认为：搞工业的人深知中国工业建设的困难。如果单由我们自己来开发新疆的石油和有色金属，照目前的技术条件看来，更不知要延缓多长时间。苏联的帮助，对我们说来是十分的需要。他说：中苏两国在协定中对股份与权益的规定是完全合乎平等互惠的原则的。苏联的投资是他们劳动人民的血汗，在生产中也应该得到合理的报酬。我们不应该以地主的态度去剥削苏联的劳动弟兄。
    北京邮政储金汇业局职工赵锦章、杨兰卿、吴志光、高庆元等，都发表感想，他们以为苏联和我们签订的这三个协定，对我国工业、交通、经济、文化建设的发展，是一种最大的帮助。协定中规定的开支、利润、人事等办法，都是公平合理的。
    教授
    北大政治系教授许德珩发表谈话称：没有苏联伟大的帮助，在我们走向工业化的路上，一切会是很困难的。苏联是先进的国家，社会主义先进的工业技术对我们的经济建设，将是一种伟大的帮助。
    北大法律系教授汪?表示：中苏合作开采石油及有色金属的协定和民航协定，是社会主义国家对我们高度友谊的援助。从创办的这三个公司中，无疑的我们将会向社会主义先进的苏联老大哥学习到许多技术上、科学上、管理上的经验。这也是培养我们劳动人民生产技术的一个好机会。
    北大化学系教授袁翰青称：石油和有色金属本身都是工业化的重要原料，而且需要有高度技术条件才能进行开采。苏联站在伟大的国际主义的立场援助我们共同开发石油、有色金属和发展民航事业，这是我们迫切需要的。
    北大政治系教授楼邦彦认为：这三个协定是中苏友好同盟互助条约的展开，以后还会有其他具体经济合作的表现的。中苏的真正经济合作，无疑的也是对美帝国主义者一个有力的打击。
    北大经济系教授樊弘说：这三项协定的签字无疑地是可以帮助我们迅速开展工业建设。中国在现有的条件下，是无力大量开采石油、有色金属等资源的。帝国主义在封锁我们，但苏联却站在高度的友谊立场上不断的援助我们，尽量想法帮助我们发展生产，提高我们的工业技术。
    北大政治系教授王铁崖、化学系教授张龙翔、清华机械系教授钱伟长也都发表谈话，认为三项协定的签订是中苏友谊进一步发展与巩固的表现。
    学生
    河北高中包英俊说：中国正缺乏石油和有色金属，来发展工业建设，苏联便帮助咱们克服这些困难，这真是处处替咱们着想。王绍顺说：这三个协定是平等互利的合作，苏联以高度技术帮助我们开发迫切需要开发的矿藏，这对我国工业发展有很大帮助。
    国立蒙藏学院纪铁民、陈芝林等同学指出：苏联帮我们寻觅、探测、开采及提炼石油与有色金属，这件事与我们早日实现工业化是不可分开的。
    该校教导组长岳寒先生说：中国是矿藏丰富的国家，蒋介石的反动统治被打垮了，中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，又得到社会主义苏联的热烈帮助，中国的工业发展将是非常迅速的。
    北京市立师范李中表示：中苏合股组织三个公司的协定，是中苏友好同盟互助条约中加强中苏经济合作的具体表现。这件事与美帝国主义指挥国民党残匪滥炸我国城市和“封锁”我国海港作一比较，这是多么强烈的对照！
    北京私立师范学校史文炳投书本报表示他对中苏合股组织三个公司的意见说：“中苏联合创办三个公司的协定，使得中苏间的经济合作更具体化了，这证明兄弟国家之间的关系是如何的密切，也再一次的证明了毛主席‘一边倒’政策的正确。我们不仅欢迎而且热忱拥护这些协定。”
