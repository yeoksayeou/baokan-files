[Report from this Newspaper] China People's Insurance Company plans to launch livestock insurance on a trial basis, and has selected the suburbs of Beijing and the Jiaodong area as key pilot areas. Investigations are currently underway.

    In order to support the government's agricultural production increase plan and develop insurance business, the company has planned to launch various agricultural insurance programs. The first decision was to establish livestock insurance, with the suburbs of Beijing and the Jiaodong area as key pilot areas. Livestock refers to cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and other livestock used for farming. The Beijing suburbs have already been surveyed twice in March, and the East China Branch has also sent personnel to the Jiaodong area for investigation in late March. The investigation targets include the total number of rural households, the total number of livestock (mainly cattle in the Jiaodong area), the market price of livestock, the livestock hide and bone market, the historical situation and mortality rate of livestock plagues, veterinary disease prevention equipment, and the comparison between the feed required by livestock and their productivity. In addition, various rural conditions related to agricultural insurance, such as the actual situation of the rural economy, the living standards of farmers, and rural cooperative organizations, are also under investigation. The above investigations are expected to be completed by the end of April. The specific methods and implementation of the insurance will be discussed and coordinated with local governments based on actual materials after the investigation is completed.
