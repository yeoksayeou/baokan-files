　　Handan Special District Winter School Converts to People's School
    Taking a Step Forward on the Basis of Mass Summary and Inspection
    Over 500 Winter Schools Have Initially Been Converted into Year-Round People's Schools
    [Our Newspaper's News] In the counties of Handan Special District, Hebei Province, 511 winter schools with relatively good management have been initially converted into year-round people's schools, accounting for 9% of the original 5,664 winter schools. According to statistics from Feixiang County, the 56 people's schools have a total of 1,663 students, most of whom are young people, all voluntarily participating in the study, and their enthusiasm for learning is very high. The Handan Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of education section chiefs from various counties and towns on March 20, and initially summarized the work of converting to people's schools in various places. According to the experience of various places, the most effective way to mobilize the masses to continue learning is to first carry out a mass winter school summary and inspection movement, so that the masses can recognize the achievements and shortcomings of winter school learning, and improve their demands and confidence in year-round learning. For example, after summarizing the achievements of the Langkuang Village Winter School in Wu'an County (93 of the 140 students learned from 100 to more than 300 characters), more than 50 young men and women continued to request learning. They said: "Going to winter school every year, learning a few words, and forgetting them after summer and autumn, what's the use? Year-round people's school is better." Secondly, when converting to people's schools, it is necessary to encourage active members in winter schools, Communist Party members, Youth League members, village cadres, etc. to take the lead. For example, Daming County rewarded 255 model winter school students, 94 model teachers, and 30 model winter schools. Through their active promotion, the county has the largest number of winter schools converted to people's schools, and eight out of ten villages in some districts have people's schools.
    The experience of various places proves that the masses (especially young people) are mostly willing to study regularly, but they are afraid that going to people's school will delay production. Therefore, people's school learning must be well integrated with production. The daily study time should not be too long, generally one hour per day in various places. In terms of learning methods, various places mostly use group learning as the main method, supplemented by collective classes, with classes held every three to five days. For people's school teachers, various places have adopted the method of recording work points for classes in exchange for labor, and those with difficult living conditions are given material subsidies to relieve their concerns about "being afraid of teaching for a long time and being unable to afford it."
    The problems existing in the conversion to people's schools in various places are: one is that some cadres and people's school teachers have a mentality of eagerness for quick success, believing that to convert to people's schools, all young and middle-aged men and women in the village must enroll; some people also believe that only collective classes can be considered people's schools. Another problem is that some cadres do not have much enthusiasm for learning themselves, nor do they actively lead the work of converting to people's schools. They believe: "Production will be busy in the future, so there will be no time to study, and it won't work anyway." They put production and learning in opposition.
    After studying the above situation, the education section chiefs of various counties also studied the summary report of Vice Minister Qian Junrui of the Ministry of Education at the National Education Work Conference. Everyone believes that the future policy is to consolidate and improve the existing people's schools on the one hand, and strive to convert some of the conditional winter schools into people's schools on the other hand. When mobilizing learning, it is necessary to use persuasive education methods to make the masses voluntarily enroll. At the beginning, young people can be the main target. The Special Commissioner's Office has also instructed various counties to combine the production and political construction work in this spring to strive for the establishment of 1,452 people's schools in the entire special district. The leading organs of youth, women, armed forces, and other organizations in the special district have also made arrangements to mobilize organized masses such as youth, women, and militiamen to actively participate in learning.

　　邯郸专区冬学转民校
    在群众性的总结检查基础上提高一步
    现已有五百余冬学首先转入常年民校
    【本报讯】河北省邯郸专区各县已有五百十一处办理较好的冬学首先转入常年民校，占原有五千六百六十四处冬学的百分之九。入学人数，据肥乡县统计，五十六处民校共有学员一千六百六十三名，其中大部分是青年，都是自愿参加学习的，学习情绪很高。邯郸专署曾于三月二十日召开了各县、镇教育科长会议，初步地总结了各地转民校的工作。据各地经验，发动群众继续学习最有效的办法，是首先开展群众性的冬学总结、检查运动，使群众认识冬学学习的成绩与缺点，提高其常年学习的要求与信心。如武安县琅矿村冬学，在总结冬学成绩后（一百四十名学员中有九十三人学会了一百字到三百多字），即有五十余名青年男女继续要求学习。他们说：“年年上冬学，识几个字，一过夏秋就忘了，中啥用？还是常年民校好。”其次，在转民校时，要鼓励冬学中的积极分子与共产党员、青年团员、村干部等起带头作用。如大名县奖励了二百五十五名模范冬学学员，九十四名模范教员和三十处模范冬学。通过他们的积极推动，该县冬学转民校的数量最多，有的区十分之八的村庄有了民校。
    各地经验证明，群众（特别是青年）多愿意经常学习，但恐怕上民校耽误生产。因之民校学习必须和生产很好结合。每天学习时间不要太长，各地一般是每天一小时。学习方式，各地多以小组学习为主，集体上课为辅，每隔三天至五天上课一次。对民校教员，各地采取了上课记工换工的方法，生活困难者更予以实物补助。以解除其“怕长年教，耽误不起”的顾虑。
    各地转民校中存在的问题，一个是有些干部和民校教员有急于求成的思想，认为要转民校，就得全村男女青壮年都要入学；也有人认为只有集体上课才能算民校。另一问题是有的干部自己学习劲头不大，也不积极去领导转民校工作。他们认为：“今后生产忙了，那顾得上学，反正搞不好。”把生产与学习对立起来。
    各县教育科长研究了上述情况后，又学习了教育部钱俊瑞副部长在全国教育工作会议上的总结报告。大家认为：今后的方针，一面是巩固提高已有民校，一面争取把有条件的冬学再转一部分为民校。动员学习时，必须以说服教育方式，使群众自愿入学。开始时可以青年为主要对象。专署并已指示各县，结合今春的生产、建政工作，争取全专区成立民校一千四百五十二处。专区的青年、妇女、武装等组织的领导机关，亦作了布置，发动青年、妇女和民兵等有组织的群众积极参加学习。
