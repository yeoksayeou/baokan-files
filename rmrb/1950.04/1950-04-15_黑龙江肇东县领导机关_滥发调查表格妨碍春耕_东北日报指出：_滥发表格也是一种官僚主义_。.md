Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: According to the Northeast Daily, the county-level leading organs of Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, in Northeast China, indiscriminately issue various survey forms during the busy spring planting season, seriously hindering the district and village cadres from leading spring production. According to statistics from the Thirteenth District of Zhaodong County, a total of twenty-one types of survey forms were assigned to the villages from March 1st to March 22nd, averaging one form to be filled out by each village for the higher-level authorities every day. Among these twenty-one types of survey forms, only nine were related to spring planting preparations. In order to complete these survey tasks, the district government had to extract four or five cadres from those who were currently working hard to lead spring planting to be specifically responsible for filling out the forms, or to go to five or six villages every day to convey and urge the submission of forms. Village cadres were also unable to directly participate in leadership and production due to being busy with surveys and filling out forms. Some village cadres said, "How can we work all day? Just when we want to work, another form comes." Others said, "The higher-level authorities call on us to participate in and lead production, but we're running around with forms all day, how can we have time to work?" Moreover, some survey form items were very complicated and deadlines were short. When village cadres were unable to complete them, they had to resort to methods such as "reporting anyway," "stubbornly not reporting," or "fabricating forms behind closed doors" to cope, resulting in very inaccurate forms. While publishing the above news, the Northeast Daily published a short commentary entitled "Indiscriminate Issuance of Forms is Also a Form of Bureaucratism," pointing out that indiscriminate issuance of forms is a bureaucratic work style that disregards the energy of lower-level cadres and the busy farming season. The short commentary suggested that before issuing forms to lower levels in the future, leading organs in various regions should carefully consider whether it is necessary and review whether there are existing materials in their own files to avoid duplication. At the same time, relevant departments in various regions should personally conduct some typical, specialized, and accurate surveys. The forms for general surveys conducted by districts and villages must be reduced as much as possible, and the survey items must be as simple as possible, so as not to delay work by making lower-level cadres busy with investigating materials and filling out forms.

　　黑龙江肇东县领导机关
    滥发调查表格妨碍春耕
    东北日报指出：“滥发表格也是一种官僚主义”。
    【新华社十三日讯】据东北日报载，东北黑龙江省肇东县县级领导机关在春耕农忙时期滥发各种调查表格，严重妨碍区、村干部领导春耕生产。据肇东县十三区的统计，从三月一日到二十二日向各村布置的调查表格共有二十一种之多，平均每个村每天即要向上级填报一个表格。在这二十一种调查表格中，与准备春耕有关的只有九种。该区政府为完成这些调查工作，不得不在目前正努力领导春耕的干部中抽出四五个人专门负责填写或每日分头跑到五、六个村子去传达和催要表格，村干部也因忙于调查、填表而不能直接参加领导和参加生产。有的村干部说：“一天那能干活，刚想干活又来了表。”还有的说：“上级号召参加和领导生产，一天老跑表那有工夫干活。”而且有的调查表项目很复杂，限期又短，村干部在无法完成时，就只好采取“不要不报”、“硬挺不报”或“关门造表”的办法来应付，结果填写的表很不确实。东北日报在发表上项消息的同时，以“滥发表格也是一种官僚主义”为题发表短评，指出：滥发表格，这是一种不顾惜下级干部精力和农忙的官僚主义作风。短评建议各地领导机关今后向下发表格前，应再三考虑有无必要和翻阅本部案卷是否已有现成材料，力避重复。同时各地有关部门应亲自动手作些典型的专门的精确调查，由区村作普遍调查的表格必须尽量减少，调查项目也必须尽可能简单，以免使下级干部因忙于调查材料和填写表格而耽误工作。
