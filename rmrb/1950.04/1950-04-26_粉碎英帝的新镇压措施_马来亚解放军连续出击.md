　　Smash the British Imperialists' New Repressive Measures
    Malayan Liberation Army Launches Continuous Attacks
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 25th] The Malayan National Liberation Army is responding to the British colonial authorities' new repressive measures following the bankruptcy of the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" with continuous and heroic attacks. According to reports from British and American news agencies, since mid-April, the Malayan Liberation Army has continuously ambushed British patrol teams, attacked police stations, colonialists' rubber plantations, and British colonialists' trucks loaded with rubber in Bahau, Negeri Sembilan, in Parit, Kedah, in Pahang, near Johor, and in the Perak area.
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 25th] After suffering failure in implementing the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month," the British colonial authorities in Malaya are plotting new conspiracies to force the Malayan people to fight against the Malayan National Liberation Army.

    According to Reuters, Brigadier Briggs, the British commander-in-chief of "bandit suppression" in Malaya, who arrived in Kuala Lumpur on April 5th, announced the establishment of the so-called "Malayan War Cabinet" on the 17th. According to Briggs' remarks, the task of this so-called "War Cabinet" is to force overseas Chinese and Malay rubber workers to provide information about guerrilla activities and to drive the Malayan people to serve as cannon fodder in the colonial war. To this end, the Malayan Federal Legislative Council, employed by the British colonial authorities, was ordered on the 19th to pass a resolution: "The British government will train a Malayan people's anti-terrorist army" to shoulder the so-called "responsibility for restoring peace and security throughout Malaya."

    However, Briggs did not dare to make any estimates on how long it would take to end the so-called "state of emergency" in Malaya. He only pleaded, "Please don't worry, and wait for us to do something. These things cannot be done quickly."

　　粉碎英帝的新镇压措施
    马来亚解放军连续出击
    【新华社二十五日讯】马来亚民族解放军正以不间断的英勇袭击，回答英国殖民当局在所谓“反匪月”破产后的新镇压措施。据英美通讯社报道：自四月中旬以来，马来亚解放军在森美兰州的巴哈、吉打州的巴林、在彭亨州、在柔佛附近以及霹雳地区中，连续地伏击英军巡逻队，袭击警察所、殖民者的橡胶园和英国殖民者装载树胶的汽车。
    【新华社二十五日讯】马来亚英国殖民当局在实施所谓“反匪月”遭受失败之后，又在策划强迫马来亚人民与马来亚民族解放军作战的新阴谋。
    据路透社消息：四月五日抵达吉隆坡的英驻马来亚“剿匪”作战总司令布里格斯，十七日宣布成立所谓“马来亚战时内阁”。这个所谓“战时内阁”的任务，据布里格斯在谈话中暗示，就是将强迫华侨与马来民族的橡胶工人供给关于游击队活动的情报，并将驱使马来亚人民充当殖民战争的炮灰。为此，英国殖民当局御用的马来亚联邦参议会，已于十九日奉命通过决议：“由英国政府训练马来亚人民的反恐怖分子军队”，以肩负所谓“恢复马来亚全境和平与安全的责任。”
    但是，布里格斯对于究竟需要多少时间才能结束马来亚的所谓“紧急状态”一点，不敢作任何估计。他只是恳求地说：“请不要着急，且待我们做一些事情。这些事情是不能赶快办好的。”
