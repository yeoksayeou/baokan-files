　　Converting Soviet-style Precision Seeders into Cotton Seeders
    Beijing Suburban Farm Administration Successfully Trials Conversion
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Suburban Farm Administration has successfully converted Soviet-style precision seeders for grain crops to sow cotton seeds, after testing. The main operational task of all state-owned farms under the Farm Administration this year is to plant cotton. The plan is to sow more than 7,500 mu, but due to the lack of cotton seed drills, it was originally planned to use Ford tractors to open furrows and sow manually. In this way, each tractor would require two people to sow seeds, and another person and a draft animal to cover the soil, and at most only 70 mu could be sown per day. Later, after careful research by more than ten employees including Xia Jiaqian, Guo Jinbo, and Liu Jiafu, and after more than ten trials, the ordinary Soviet-style precision grain seeder was converted into a cotton seeder for both precision sowing and row sowing. Each machine now only requires two people to sow 150 mu per day, greatly improving sowing efficiency. The precision sowing row spacing is 28 inches, and the plant spacing is 18.7 inches, with 15 to 20 seeds sown per hole. Row sowing has the same row spacing and sowing quantity as precision sowing. The sowing amount per mu is 9 to 10 jin. The Farm Administration is now mass-producing these converted machines to ensure that the sowing work is completed ahead of schedule.

　　改苏联式点播机为播棉机
    京郊农场管理局试制成功
    【本报讯】京郊农场管理局改制苏联式庄稼点播机播种棉花，经试验已获成功。农管局所属各国营农场今年的经营任务主要是种植棉花。计划播种七千五百余亩，因缺乏棉籽播种机，原拟使用福特拖拉机开沟，用人工播种。这样每部拖拉机即需二人下种，另需一个人和一头牲口盖土，且每日最多仅可播种七十亩。后由夏家骞、郭金波、刘家富等十余职工精心研究，并经十多次试验，将苏联式普通庄稼点播机改制为点播、条播两用的棉花播种机。每部机器仅需二人即可日播一百五十亩。大大的提高了播种效率。点播行距二十八英寸，株距十八点七英寸。每穴下种十五至二十粒。条播行距及播种量与点播相同。每亩地的播种量为九至十斤。现农管局正大量改制这种机器，俾使播种工作提前完成。
