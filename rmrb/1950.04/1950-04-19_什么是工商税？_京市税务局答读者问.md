What is the Industrial and Commercial Tax?
Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau Answers Readers' Questions

Editor:
I have several questions that I cannot resolve. Please answer them for me:
    I. Is the industrial and commercial tax determined by capital and revenue?
    II. I run a small paint shop in this city. When I reported my capital in 1949, it was equivalent to 15,000 jin of millet. Now, the inventory is worth 16 million yuan, equivalent to a little over 11,000 jin of millet, resulting in an actual loss. How much industrial and commercial tax should I pay?
    III. Should the payment of various taxes be made after deducting our operating profit and maintaining the minimum living expenses of our colleagues?
    IV. If the profit is not sufficient to pay the tax, can I apply to the authorities for a reduction of various taxes?

Lei Zheng Guang:
Your questions have been answered by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau as follows:
    (1) The industrial and commercial tax includes business tax and income tax. Business tax is levied based on the net sales amount (i.e., total sales amount minus sales returns and sales allowances) or the total operating revenue. Tax rates: ① 1% to 3% levied on the net sales amount, ② 1.5% to 6% levied on the total operating revenue. Income tax is levied on the income amount, with tax rates ranging from 5% to 30%.
    (2) The profit or loss of a store's business is not entirely reflected in the inventory item. Because under the asset items, in addition to inventory, there are other items such as real estate, business furniture, machinery, accounts receivable, etc. If the result of a year's operation is that the ending inventory is less than the beginning inventory, but other assets increase or liabilities decrease, it does not necessarily mean a loss. If the result of the operation is only that the ending inventory is less than the beginning inventory, and other asset and liability items remain unchanged, it is a loss, and no income tax is paid, but business tax is still levied.
    (3) The living expenses of colleagues in the shop are reasonable expenses and should be deducted from the gross profit.
    (4) Business tax and income tax are levied according to the above tax rates, so there will be no situation where the profit is not enough to pay income tax. The above method refers to merchants with a sound accounting system. For merchants without a sound accounting system or with inaccurate accounting records, it is difficult to determine whether they are actually making a profit or loss. According to typical investigation materials from the past year, false accounting is still quite common and quite serious.

### 什么是工商税？  京市税务局答读者问

　　什么是工商税？
    京市税务局答读者问编者先生：
    我有几个问题，无法解决。请你们解答：
    一、工商税是否按资本及流水账而定？
    二、我在本市开一小颜料铺。在一九四九年报资本时，共合伏地小米一万五千斤；现在存货业值一千六百万元，合伏地小米一万一千余斤，实地亏本。我应交工商税若干？
    三、交纳各税是否应在我们营利内、维持我们同人最底生活费后，再交纳各种税款？
    四、营利如不够交纳税款时，是否可以申请当局减少各税？
                                雷轸光雷轸光君：
    你的问题，已经由北京市人民政府税务局解答如下：
    （一）工商税包括营业税与所得税。营业税是根据销货净额（即销货总额减去销货退回及销货折让）或营业总收益额课征。税率：①按销货净额课征百分之一到百分之三，②按营业总收益额课征百分之一点五到百分之六。所得税则按所得额课征，税率为百分之五到百分之三十。（二）商店营业的盈亏不完全表现在存货一项上。因为资产科目项下，除存货外，尚有其他各项，如房地产，生财家具，机器，应收债权等。如一年经营的结果，虽然期末存货较期初存货减少了，但如其他资产增加或负债减少，不见得即是亏本。假如经营的结果，只是期末存货较期初存货减少了，而其他资产与负债科目均无变化，即为亏损，不纳所得税，但营业税照征。
    （三）柜上同人的生活费，为合理开支，应由毛利项下减除。
    （四）营业税与所得税是按以上税率课征的，所以不会发生营利不够缴纳所得税的情况。以上办法系指有健全会计制度之商号而言，如无健全会计制度或账目记载不实的商号，究竟实赔实赚是难以判断的，根据一年来典型调查材料，说明假账情况还是相当普遍，相当严重的。
