Party Life

　　Learning in the Nankai University Branch
    Zheng Zhiguang
    In the past, serious tendencies of事務ism existed among the Communist Party members of Nankai University, with a separation of thought between learning and work. When they saw the branch committee members and group leaders, they would exclaim “Too busy with work!” and could not accept the work assigned by the Party happily. At the same time, most Party members were from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, mostly probationary members, and lacked sufficient Party education. Organizational life was also unsound, lacking the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Among the Party members, unhealthy tendencies of arrogance, individual heroism, and liberalism were growing. In light of this situation, the first branch meeting last year decided to establish a learning system and specifically arranged the December learning plan. Subsequently, the branch offices in the East, South, and North campuses actively promoted and launched the learning movement. The content of the learning was coordinated with the specific circumstances of each branch office and the needs of the Party members. For example, most of the comrades in the East campus were newly admitted to the Party, organizational life was unsound, work was sluggish, and organizational resolutions could not be implemented. Therefore, the East campus branch focused on class education, on the transformation of ideological consciousness, and studied documents such as the "Central Committee's Decision on Enhancing Party Spirit." The North campus had fewer Party members (only three), who regularly attended various meetings and were busy with administrative work all day long, lacking concrete leadership in promoting work. Therefore, it was decided to study Comrade Stalin's "On Leadership and Inspection." After completing the study of "Combat Liberalism" and the "Central Committee's Decision on Enhancing Party Spirit," the South campus discovered that individualistic thinking still existed among Party members, and continued to study the second chapter of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of a Communist Party Member," sections two, three, and four on individual interests being subordinate to the interests of the Party. The learning method was mainly self-study. The branch emphasized that studying documents should be combined with ideological criticism and self-criticism, and reflection notes should be written during the learning process. It opposed the learning method of simply reading books without relating to one's own thinking. During the learning process, the comrades generally were able to conscientiously implement the branch resolutions. For example, after studying the "Central Committee's Decision on Enhancing Party Spirit," Comrade Feng Baozeng wrote a self-reflection autobiography, examining the thinking of individual heroism and analyzing in detail the ideological roots of not actively offering suggestions to the organization and not displaying class comradeship in the past. Comrade Chen Yingu (professor) also wrote a "Review of Studying 'Combat Liberalism'," recognizing the liberalism of simply demanding one's own progress without actively helping others and being unwilling to engage in principled arguments with others. Furthermore, various undesirable tendencies such as "being worldly-wise and playing safe, seeking only to avoid mistakes" and "minding one's own business, not interfering in others' affairs" were traced back to their ideological roots. The Party members in the East campus, combined with document study, conducted self-examination in group meetings and also exposed some ideological problems. For example, Comrade Wang Duanjing, due to an unclear class consciousness, did not have a sufficient understanding of his landlord family and was affecting his work and study due to family life issues. At the group meeting, with the help of the comrades, he clarified that this was a matter of class standpoint, and from then on, he studied actively, worked proactively, and consciously demanded to do a good job in investigation and research.
    The above are some of the gains made by the Nankai University CPC branch in grasping ideological education within the Party.

　　南开大学支部的学习
    郑致光
    南开大学的共产党员中过去存在着严重的事务主义作风，思想上把学习与工作对立起来。他们见了支部委员及小组长就叫“功课忙”，不能愉快的接受党所分配的工作。同时党员大都是小资产阶级出身，多半又是候补党员，受党的教育不够，组织生活也不健全，缺乏批评与自我批评精神，在党员中间，滋长着自高自大、个人英雄主义，自由主义的不良倾向。根据这种情况，去年第一次支部大会就决定建立学习制度，具体布置了十二月份学习计划。接着，东、南、北三院各分支部都积极推动和展开了学习运动。学习内容是与各分支部的具体情况和党员的需要相配合的。例如：东院同志多半是新入党的，组织生活不健全，工作疲塌，组织决议不能贯彻。因此东院支部着重于阶级教育，着重思想意识的改造，学习“中央关于增强党性的决定”等文件。北院因党员少（只三人），经常参加各种会议，成天忙事务工作，在推动工作中，具体领导不够。因此决定学习斯大林同志的“论领导与检查”。南院在学完《反对自由主义》及《中央关于增强党性的决定》后，发觉党员中还存在着个人主义的思想，又继续学习刘少奇同志的“论共产党员的修养”中的第二章个人利益服从党的利益第二、三、四节。学习方法是以自学为主。支部强调学习文件要结合思想进行批评与自我批评，学习中要写反省笔记。反对单纯的看书而不联系自己思想的学习方法。在学习中，一般同志均能认真执行支部决议。如冯宝曾同志在学习《中央关于增强党性的决定》后，作了一篇反省自传，检讨了个人英雄主义的思想，详细分析过去不积极向组织提意见，没有发挥同志间的阶级友爱的思想根源。陈荫谷同志（教授）也作了一篇《学习〈反对自由主义〉的检讨》，认识了单纯要求自己进步，而不积极帮助别人，不愿和别人作原则争论的自由主义。又如“明哲保身，但求无过”，“事不关己，高高挂起”的种种不良倾向，都追根究底的挖出了思想根源。东院的党员，结合文件学习，在小组会上进行检讨，也揭发了一些思想问题。如王端菁同志由于阶级意识不明确，对自己的地主家庭认识不够，因为家庭生活问题而影响工作和学习。在小组会上，经过同志们的帮助，他明确了这是阶级立场问题，从此学习积极工作主动，自觉的要求搞好调查研究工作。
    上述是南开大学中共支部抓紧党内思想教育的一些收获。
