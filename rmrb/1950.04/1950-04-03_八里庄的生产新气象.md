　　New Production Atmosphere in Balizhuang
　　Pei Lan
    In the rural areas near the capital, a new atmosphere is now in full swing. Farmers who have obtained land are working diligently, and landlords who never worked in the past have also begun to go to the fields. Everywhere, people are striving for a "ten percent increase" in production. When this reporter recently visited Balizhuang, the village chief, Liu Zhenqing, said, "We will increase production by 20 percent this year." Balizhuang is a village with 2,119 people and 3,641 mu of land; the land reform was carried out well. There are 16 Communist Party members and 34 Communist Youth League members in the village. The relationship between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses, is very good. Judging from everyone's production enthusiasm, a 20 percent increase is assured. Liu Zhenqing said, "Our village's production plan was decided by the masses through discussion. We formulated this plan based on the quality of the land in our village and the amount of fertilizer prepared. Three large carts of manure per mu and plowing one more time will complete this task." The poor peasant, Tang Konghai, had never seen a red deed in his forty-two years. During the land reform last year, he was allocated four mu of land and quickly received a land certificate. He carefully wrapped the land certificate and put it in his pocket. Whether he was plowing or pulling mud from the ditch, he would take out the small package and look at it whenever he could spare a moment, saying with a smile, "I must produce well, or I will let down Chairman Mao!" Zhang Zoushi, a widow in her sixties, was allocated two mu of land last year. As soon as the land reform ended, she asked the village chief and the head of the peasants' association to help her borrow a cart to haul manure. She has already hauled six or seven carts of mud from the ditch. Village cadres and Party and League members are even more active in production. The village government only leaves one or two people to handle daily work, and the rest go to the fields early and return late to transport manure, plow the land, and cultivate the land. The Party branch secretary, the village chief, and the head of the peasants' association are busy with work, but they have not neglected production. They try to squeeze in time, and often they have already transported two or three carts of manure before ordinary farmers get up. The village chief said, "The masses need me to work, and I must do a good job. However, I cannot neglect production. If I don't do a good job in my own production, I cannot lead the masses."
    In the past, women only did light work in the fields, but this year most of them are doing heavy work as well. Party member Chang Xiuqing's husband is participating in digging ditches, while she is plowing and reclaiming wasteland at home, and making shoe soles at night. There is some wasteland in the village that no one had ever reclaimed in the past. This year, the government proposed that whoever reclaims it can cultivate it, and the masses are competing to reclaim it. Hu Lijun, the director of the women's federation, organized three women to reclaim 1.8 mu. Zhang Yuming and his wife, who were fond of eating and lazy, used to have seven or eight mu of land, but they depleted their resources and sold all the land. After the land reform, through patient persuasion and education by Hu Lijun and others, the man first dug ditches and then reclaimed wasteland, and has now reclaimed four mu. The woman makes soles early and sleeps late. The government lent them 30 jin of millet as seed, and the village cadres helped them solve many difficulties, consolidating their production enthusiasm.
    Those who were originally landlords and rich peasants have gradually understood the correctness of the government's policies after the land reform and are actively accumulating fertilizer and preparing vegetable seedlings for production. However, they still have some concerns—they dare not hire workers. They are afraid that hiring workers will be considered exploitation and that there will be "another struggle." They are also afraid that hired workers will not work hard and that wages will be high. The cadres adopted individual visits and meetings to repeatedly explain the government's policies, which dispelled this concern. The rich peasant Jing Yucheng said, "I understand now, and I feel at ease. Let's hurry up and hire workers!" At the same time, women from landlord and rich peasant families who used to not participate in labor are also participating in production.
    The production work in Balizhuang is not smooth sailing. For example, there were once more than 100 households that had nothing to eat. After careful consideration of the local production conditions, the CCP village branch secretary Liu Hengbo, village chief Liu Zhenqing, and peasants' association director Li Wengui contacted the Second Engineering Zone of the Public Health Bureau engineering team. The village chief took the lead in participating in digging ditches. Each person could earn more than five jin and six liang of millet per day by digging more than two cubic meters of soil, which could be exchanged for ten jin of red sorghum, enough to feed four people. By the end of the second lunar month, the masses had some resources, and there was a full guarantee for spring plowing and sowing.

　　八里庄的生产新气象
    培蓝
    在首都近郊的农村中，现在充满了一派新气象。获得土地的农民们都在勤劳生产；过去从没有劳动过的地主，有的也开始下地了。到处都在为着“提高一成”而努力。记者日前走访八里庄，村长刘振清说：“我们今年要增产百分之二十”。八里庄是一个拥有二千一百一十九口人，三千六百四十一亩土地的村子；土地改革作得不错。村里有十六个共产党员，三十四个青年团员，党和群众的关系、干部和群众的关系都很好。照大家的生产情绪看来，提高二成是有把握的。刘振清说：“我们村里的生产计划，是群众讨论决定的。我们根据本村土地的好坏，肥料准备的多少，订了这个计划。每亩地上三大车粪，多锄一遍，这个任务就能完成了。”贫农汤空海，活了四十二岁，从没见过红契。去年土地改革时，他分了四亩地，很快又拿到了土地证。他谨慎小心地把土地证包好，装在衣袋里。不管刨地时、拉沟泥时，只要能抽点工夫，就打开小包看看，笑逐颜开地对着土地证说：“我要不好好生产，可对不起毛主席他老人家呀！”六十多岁的寡妇张邹氏，去年分了二亩地，土地改革刚结束，她便找村长、农会主任帮她借车拉粪，到现在已经拉了六、七车沟泥。村干部和党、团员生产更积极。村政府每天只留下一两个人处理日常工作，其余的人都是起早搭黑往地运粪，刨地，耕地。中共支书和村长、农会主任工作较忙，但生产也都没误了。他们想法挤时间，常常是一般农民才起床，他们已经运了两三车粪。村长说：“群众需要我工作，我一定要作好；可是，还不能把生产误了。自己生产搞不好，就领导不了群众。”
    妇女们过去下地只是作些轻活，今年大多数也都做起重活来了。党员常秀青的男人参加挖河沟，她在家里刨地、开荒，晚上还纳鞋底。该村有些荒地，过去从没有人开过，今年政府提出谁开谁种，群众都争着开荒。妇联主任胡丽君组织了三个妇女，开了一亩八分。好吃懒作的张玉明夫妇，过去有七、八亩地，两人坐吃山空，把地都卖光了。土地改革后，经胡丽君等耐心地说服教育，男人先挖河沟，后开荒地，现在已经开了四亩；女人早起晚睡纳底子。政府贷给他们三十斤小米的种籽，村干部又帮助他们解决了许多困难，巩固了他们的生产情绪。
    原来是地主、富农的，经过土地改革，也逐渐了解了政府政策的正确，积极积肥，收拾菜秧准备生产。但他们心里还有一些顾虑——不敢雇工。他们怕雇工算剥削，“再来一次斗争”。又怕雇工不好好劳动，又怕工资高。干部们采取个别访问和开会的方式，反复解释政府政策，结果打破了这个顾虑。富农景玉成说：“这可明白了，心里踏实了。该雇工的赶快雇吧！”同时过去常不参加劳动的地主、富农家里的妇女们也参加了生产。
    八里庄的生产工作也不是一帆风顺。譬如，曾经有一百多户没有吃的。中共村支书刘恒博、村长刘振清、农会主任李文贵周密地考虑了当地的生产条件后，与公共卫生局工程队第二工区洽妥，村长亲自带头，参加挖河沟。每天每人挖两方多土，可赚五斤六两小米，换成十斤红高粱，可以养活四口人。挖到阴历二月底止，群众有了一些底子，春耕播种也就有十足的保证了。
