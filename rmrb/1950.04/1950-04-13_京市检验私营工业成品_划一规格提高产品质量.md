　　Beijing Inspects Private Industrial Products
    Standardizing Specifications to Improve Product Quality
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to improve the quality of products from private industries in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry has decided to gradually inspect finished products from various sectors. The finished products that have already been inspected are platform scales from the metrology industry. The specifications of the eight factories in the city that manufacture platform scales varied, and the general quality was low, with insufficient accuracy. After this inspection, the Bureau of Industry has initially established five standard models. From April 6th, all factories must manufacture according to these standard models, with uniform specifications. Compared to previous finished products, these scales are more robust and durable, with enhanced accuracy and sensitivity. The industry currently under inspection is the soap manufacturing industry. The Bureau of Industry has selected five types of soap with different qualities and entrusted the Research Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government to conduct chemical analyses. The Bureau will then publish the ingredient ratios, manufacturing methods, and test results for the factories to use as reference.
