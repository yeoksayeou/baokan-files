　　Thoughts on the Performance of "Not a Cicada" in the Capital
　　(Wei Lianzhen, Shijiazhuang Vehicle Inspection Section)
　　Whenever friends introduced me to others, they would always say, "This is Comrade Wei Lianzhen, the author of 'Not a Cicada.'" Hearing this always gave me a strange feeling. I'm just a worker who wields a hammer. Although I've written two plays, they hardly seem like proper plays. My intention in writing them wasn't to become a writer, but simply to inspire my fellow workers to work hard in our production roles. Who would have thought that my play "Not a Cicada" would be performed in Beijing? It must be everyone encouraging me, but I’m truly a bit confused.

　　On the second night of the performance in Beijing, ah, I felt truly honored. I never dreamed I would meet the famous writers Mr. Ouyang Yuqian and Mr. Cao Yu. They shook my hand, sat with me cordially to talk, and I was incredibly happy. They praised me while watching the performance of "Not a Cicada," and my heart raced, my head felt like it had grown bigger. I am grateful to these two elder statesmen for their kindness and care.

　　The next day, at the symposium discussing "Not a Cicada," I met many more famous writers and elder statesmen. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian also came. He was truly concerned about me, told me many methods of writing plays, and I was extremely grateful. Everyone offered valuable opinions, proving everyone's emphasis on this play and their concern for the working class. Here, on behalf of all the employees of the Shijiazhuang Vehicle Inspection Section, I extend my deepest gratitude to all the elder statesmen! I hope the elder statesmen will forever help the worker brothers to continuously advance on the literary and artistic front!

　　“不是蝉”在首都演出的感想
    （石家庄检车段魏连珍）
    曾经有许多朋友把我介绍给别人时，总是说：这是“不是蝉”作者魏连珍同志。我听了这句话心里真有一股说不出来的滋味。本来我是一个拿锤子的工人，虽然写过二个剧，但是都不像一个剧的样子呀。我写剧的目的并不打算当一个作家，只不过是为要在我的工作岗位上启发工友们努力生产。谁料想把我写的“不是蝉”演到北京来了呢？这一定是大家鼓励我吧，我心里真有些闹不清楚了。
    在北京演出的第二晚上，啊呀，我实在觉得光荣得很，作梦我也想不到认识了我国名作家欧阳予倩先生和曹禺先生。他们和我握手，亲切的和我坐在一起谈话，我真高兴极了。他们一边看“不是蝉”的上演，一边夸奖我，我心里直乱跳，脑袋好像大了些。我感谢这二位老前辈对我的亲切爱护。
    第二天在讨论“不是蝉”的座谈会上，我又认识了很多的名作家和老前辈。欧阳予倩先生也来了，他对我真关切，告诉我很多写剧的方法，我真感激得了不得。大家都提出宝贵的意见，这证明了大家对这个剧的重视和对工人阶级的关心。在这里，我代表我们石家庄检车段全段员工向各位老前辈致深深的谢意！希望老前辈们永远的帮助工人兄弟们在文艺战线上不断的前进！
