　　From the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance to the Significance of Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation in Xinjiang
    — Zhang Zhizhong's Broadcast on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on April 19th
    [Xinhua News Agency] Zhang Zhizhong, member of the Central People's Government and Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, delivered a speech on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 19th, entitled "From the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance to the Significance of Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation in Xinjiang." The text is as follows:
    I made a statement at the Sixth Session of the Central People's Government Committee when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance was adopted. Now, at the request of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, I am broadcasting it to all compatriots across the country.
    This time, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the direction of Premier Zhou, our China has signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. This is a major event of great historical significance. The signing of this treaty has consolidated the permanent friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union, laid the foundation for lasting peace and universal security in the world, and is warmly supported and celebrated by all Chinese people, as well as warmly supported and welcomed by the vast masses of peace-loving, democratic, and progressive people around the world.
    The treaty contains many significant meanings, and two points are of particularly great significance:
    First, it stipulates that efforts should be made to secure the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. For the past hundred years, we have suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, and this history of blood and tears is mainly the history of Japanese imperialist aggression against China. We fought a bloody war of resistance for eight years entirely to resist Japanese imperialist aggression. Now, it has been almost five years since the victory of the war of resistance, but a peace treaty with Japan has been delayed, which is one of the main factors constituting the turbulent situation in the Far East and even the world. Therefore, we must strive for the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. We should use the treaty as a guarantee to smash the attempts of American imperialism to arm Japan, control China, and threaten the Soviet Union, and at the same time prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarist fascism, so as to avoid endangering peace in the Far East and the world. In other words, in order to ensure peace in the East and even the world, it is necessary to quickly strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, and now is the time for us to do so. Our new China is fully qualified to speak on this matter.
    Second, it stipulates that China and the Soviet Union shall provide each other with economic assistance and carry out economic cooperation. The significance of this point is even greater than the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Now, although our China has stood up, it is still an economically backward country. We must catch up in order to build China into a modern, industrialized country, to raise the cultural and economic living standards of the people, to smoothly enter the socialist stage from the new democratic stage, and to take on the task of maintaining lasting world peace without any regrets. However, when it comes to construction, it is not enough to rely solely on our own existing strength; we must also rely on foreign assistance. The Soviet Union's construction in the early days of the revolution is a good example. And looking around the world, only the Soviet Union truly "treats us as equals" and has the strength and enthusiasm to help us. It has achieved great socialist construction achievements - abundant technology and experience, advanced industrial equipment, and scientific progress. Using their technology, experience, and equipment to help us will surely accelerate our economic construction.
    In addition to the above two points, there are two very important sentences in the preamble to this treaty, namely that China and the Soviet Union "are eager to consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world in accordance with the goals and principles of the United Nations." These two sentences have affirmed and fully expressed our desire for world peace and our attitude towards the United Nations. We only need to look at Mr. Lie's various well-intentioned activities regarding the issue of the New China's representation in the United Nations, as well as the American government's kind of outwardly stern but inwardly weak and ambiguous expression, to see that these two sentences have already had a positive impact. And it goes without saying that peace-loving and democratic countries and people all over the world have expressed unlimited sympathy and support for the sincere attitude of China and the Soviet Union.
    As for the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushun (Port Arthur), Dalian (Dairen), and the various industrial, commercial enterprises, and business establishments operated by the Soviet Union in Northeast China, numbering as many as 556, all of them will be returned to China without compensation (it is only right that Lushun should compensate the Soviet Union for the cost of construction equipment). Although the economic loan of 300 million US dollars is not a large amount, it is precisely the machinery and materials we urgently need for our initial construction. "Borrow less, pay back less, and it will not be difficult to borrow again," and the interest rate is only one percent. Now the Soviet Union has sent a large number of outstanding experts to China to assist us in the restoration and construction of various industries and transportation, regardless of compensation and without fear of hardship. All of this shows the brotherly love and assistance of the Soviet Union to China. What else can we say except to express our respect and gratitude?
    In addition, the agreement on the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Civil Aviation Company and the agreements on the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Petroleum Company and the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Company for Non-Ferrous and Rare Metals in Xinjiang are all formulated in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, with the aim of assisting the development of China's aviation industry and China's industry, and strengthening economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. I have served in the Northwest for many years and have a lot of personal experience and understanding. Now I would like to specifically explain the two agreements on Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in Xinjiang.
    First of all, we must ask: Is it possible for China to independently develop these two kinds of mineral resources in Xinjiang at present? I can say with certainty: it is impossible; not only is it impossible now, but it may not be possible even in five, ten, or even fifteen years. The reason is very simple: to develop mineral resources, the first requirement is transportation conditions. The existing single-line highway in the Northwest cannot bear this responsibility; there must be modern railways. According to the Ministry of Railways of the State Council, the railway will be built to Lanzhou next year, to Yumen in five years, and from Yumen to Dihua and then to the mine, there are two to three times more roads than from Lanzhou to Yumen. Won't it take another ten or even fifteen years to complete? The second requirement is new industrial equipment and technology. The equipment for these two companies is said to require 200,000 to 300,000 tons of machinery. Can we manufacture it ourselves? Where will it come from? Moreover, our technology and talent are not enough, which is an irreparable shortcoming for the time being. The slow development of the Yumen Oil Mine can prove that we do not have the conditions to independently develop mineral resources in Xinjiang at present. If we have to wait for ten or even fifteen years before there is hope, then what should we do in these ten or fifteen years? We can only allow the goods to be abandoned on the ground, which is tantamount to hoarding gold and starving, and it is also very unfavorable for national defense construction.
    Secondly, the Northwest provinces, especially Xinjiang, are the most backward regions in the country. Since Sheng Shicai's opportunistic anti-Soviet activities, economic relations with the Soviet Union have been completely cut off; and it is isolated in the frontier, with extremely difficult transportation and extremely scarce supplies. In recent years, the economy of the entire province has been exhausted, and the people's lives have been miserable. Now, being able to promptly carry out Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in Xinjiang will greatly change everything. Therefore, from the perspective of improving people's lives, we should not wait for ten or fifteen years before starting development work.
    Finally, we must ask: Are these two agreements in line with the principles of equality and mutual benefit? I can also answer with certainty: they are in line with these principles. So-called mutual benefit means that both parties benefit, but judging from the actual situation, it is indeed beneficial to the Soviet Union, but greatly beneficial to China. For example, oil is what we need most and the Soviet Union has a surplus. It should be allocated 50 percent of the products, but it is not cost-effective to transport it back to the Soviet Union by truck, and of course it should be given to China as much as possible. The main non-ferrous and rare metals are tungsten, antimony, tin, etc. (gold, silver, and platinum are not within the scope of the agreement), which are needed by the Soviet Union and China has a surplus. They are usually exported from Shanghai or Hong Kong. If the products of Xinjiang are to be transported to Shanghai or Hong Kong for export, not to mention other problems, it is also too uneconomical. The Soviet Union is our great brotherly country. Standing on the position of internationalism, we are of course willing to give it to them. As for equality, it goes without saying that the spirit and content of each clause and sentence reflect equality in capital, equality in profits, and equality in all positions. There is absolutely no inequality. For example, these two agreements were negotiated with the Soviet side by me in 1948. Taking the clauses that had been agreed upon at that time but not signed as an example, they are far less favorable than they are today. For example, in the past, the Soviet side advocated that the agreement should be valid for 50 years, because they believed that the equipment and investment would be too costly if the time was too short, but now the Soviet side only requires 30 years. In terms of industrial construction, 30 years is not a long time. With the vastness of the area north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang and the richness of the reserves, 30 years of mining is only equivalent to a drop in the bucket. If all our conditions are met after 30 years, we can do it entirely on our own. Another example is that with regard to the positions of chairman (now the director of the management committee) and general manager of the two companies, in the past, the Soviet side advocated that the chairman should be filled by a Chinese representative, but the general manager (who is responsible for actual power and responsibility) must be filled by a Soviet representative. Now it is stipulated that it should be rotated every three years, and a rotational responsibility system should be implemented, which is also equality in management rights and personnel rights.
    Based on the above analysis, Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in Xinjiang, especially the development of these two resources, is indeed a very timely, very necessary, and most urgently needed work to be started. If you understand the above points, you will no longer have any doubts. If you read the editorial "Welcome Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation That is Conducive to China's Economic Construction" in the People's Daily on April 5th again, you will definitely gain more understanding.
    In the entire Sino-Soviet economic cooperation, these two agreements are only the beginning. We warmly expect that Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in Xinjiang will soon be extended to the five northwestern provinces, so that the entire Northwest will become the largest industrial zone in the country, able to keep pace with the industrial construction of Soviet Central Asia, and the two national defense bases will be united back-to-back, each undertaking the sacred task of the great motherland's national defense!

　　从中苏盟约说到中苏在新疆经济合作的意义
    —张治中四月十九日在中央人民广播电台播讲
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府委员，西北军政委员会副主席张治中，十九日于中央人民广播电台发表演讲，题目是《从中苏盟约说到中苏在新疆经济合作的意义》，文如下：
    我在中央人民政府委员会第六次会议通过中苏盟约时曾说了一番话，现在应中央人民广播电台之请，特向全国同胞广播。
    这次我们中国由于毛主席的领导和周总理的主持，和伟大的社会主义国家苏联签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，这是具有伟大的历史意义的一件大事。由于这一条约的签订，巩固了中苏两大国家永久友好合作的关系，奠定了世界持久和平与普遍安全的基础，为全中国人民所热烈拥护庆祝，也为全世界爱好和平民主进步的广大群众所热烈拥护欢迎。
    条约内容包含了许多重大的意义，而具有特别重大意义的有两点：
    第一、它规定了应尽可能迅速争取对日和约的缔结。近一百年来，我们备受帝国主义的压迫剥削，这一篇血泪史，主要的是日本帝国主义侵略中国史。我们八年浴血抗战，完全是为了反抗日本帝国主义的侵略，现在抗战胜利快达五年之久，而对日和约迟迟未能成立，这是构成远东乃至世界动荡局面的主要因素之一，所以我们一定要争取对日和约的迅速签订。我们应当拿和约作保证，来粉碎美帝武装日本控制中国威胁苏联的企图，同时杜绝了日本军阀法西斯主义的复起，以免危害远东和世界的和平。换言之，为了保障东方乃至世界的和平，必须迅速争取对日和约的签订，而现在正是时候了，我们新中国也有这个充分资格说话了。
    第二、它规定了中苏两大国家彼此相互给予经济的援助，实行经济合作。这一点意义的重大，比之签订对日和约有过之而无不及。现在，我们中国虽然已经站起来了，但还是一个经济落后的国家；我们一定要迎头赶上，才可以使中国建设起来，成为一个现代化工业化的国家，才可以提高人民文化和经济的生活水平，才可以由新民主主义顺利地进入到社会主义的阶段，也才可以毫无遗憾地担负起维持世界持久和平的一份任务。但是，要谈到建设，只靠自己原有力量还不够，还得借重外助，苏联革命初期的建设就是一个很好的例证。而环顾世界各国，真正“以平等待我”而且有力量有热忱帮助我们的只有苏联。它具有伟大的社会主义建设的成绩——充分的技术和经验，高度的工业设备和科学进步。拿他们的技术、经验和设备来帮助我们，一定可以加速我们经济建设的进行。
    除了上述两点以外，在这个条约的前言里，有两句很重要的话，就是中苏两大国家“亟愿依据联合国组织的目标和原则，巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全。”这两句话把我们对世界和平的热望和对联合国的态度已经肯定而充分地表示出来。我们只要看为了新中国出席联合国代表问题赖伊氏种种善意的活动，以至美国政府那一种色厉内荏模棱两可的表示，就可以看出这两句话已经发生了良好影响。而全世界爱好和平民主的国家和人民对中苏两国这样真诚态度的表示寄予无限同情和支持，是更不待言的。
    至于中长铁路、旅顺大连和苏联在东北经营的工商业企业各种事业机构有五五六号之多，都是无偿地交还中国（旅顺须补偿苏联建设设备相当的代价是应该的）。三亿美元的经济贷款虽然数字不大，但都是我们初期建设所迫切需要的机械和物资，“少借少还，再借不难”，而且只有百分之一的利息。现在苏联已经派遣了大量的卓越的专家到中国来，不计待遇不辞劳苦地协助我们各种工业及交通的恢复与建设。这一切的一切，都说明了苏联对中国兄弟般的友爱和援助，我们除表示了敬意和感谢之外，还有什么话说？
    还有，中苏民用航空股份公司的协定及中苏在新疆合办石油股份公司和有色及稀有金属股份公司的协定，则是完全依据平等互利的原则拟订，目的在协助中国航空事业及中国工业的发展和加强中苏两国的经济合作。本人在西北服务多年，身历其境，了解较多，现在愿特别对中苏在新疆经济合作两协定加以说明。
    首先，我们要问：中国现在是不是具有单独开发新疆这两种矿产的可能？我可以肯定地说：不可能；不但现在不可能，再过五年、十年，甚至十五年也许还是谈不到。理由很简单，开发矿产，第一要具备交通的条件。西北现有的单线公路是不可能负起这个责任的，一定要有现代的铁路。据政务院铁道部表示，明年把铁路修到兰州，五年修到玉门，玉门到迪化再到矿场还有比兰州到玉门更远两至三倍的道路，岂不是要再过十年乃至十五年才能完成？第二要具备新式的工业设备和技术。这两个公司的设备，据说便要二三十万吨的机器，我们能自己制造吗？从那里来？而我们的技术和人才都感不够，更是一时无法弥补的缺憾，以玉门油矿发展那末迟缓做例子，就可证明我们现在没有具备单独开发新疆矿产的条件。如果要等待十年甚至十五年以后才有希望，那么在这十年十五年之内怎么办？就只有听任货弃于地，无异窖金受饿了，而且对于国防建设的意义上说也是很不利的。
    其次，西北各省特别是新疆，是全国最落后的地区，自盛世才投机反苏以后，和苏联经济关系完全隔绝；而它又塞外孤悬，交通异常困难，物资异常缺乏，几年来全省经济已形枯竭，人民生活困苦，不堪言状，现在能及时展开中苏在新省经济合作，一切必大为改观；所以就从改善人民生活的意义来说，我们也不应等待十年十五年后才来从事开发的工作。
    最后，我们要问：这两个协定是不是符合平等互利的原则？我也可以肯定地答复：是符合的。所谓互利，就是双方有利，但是从实际情况看，对苏联固有利，而对中国则大有利。举例来说，石油是我们最需要而苏联则有余的，它应分得产品的百分之五十，如果用汽车运回苏联，是件不合算的事，当然尽可能的让给中国。有色稀有金属中主要的是钨、锑、锡等（金、银、白金不在协定范围之内），是苏联所需要而中国则有余的，向由上海或香港出口，如果新疆的产品要运到上海或香港出口，姑不论其他问题，也是一件太不合算的事。而苏联是我们伟大的兄弟之邦，站在国际主义者的立场，我们当然愿意让给它。至于平等，更不必说，条款精神和内容的一条一句，都表现了资金平等，利润平等，一切地位平等，绝对没有丝毫不平等之处。举例来说，这两项协定是一九四八年就由我主持和苏方进行谈判的，就拿当时已得协议但未签订的条文来说，也远不如今日的优厚。比方过去苏方主张协定有效期间是五十年，因为他们认为在设备和投资方面，时间短了太赔本，而现在苏方只要三十年了。在工业建设方面，三十年时间不算长，以新疆天山南北地域之大和蕴藏之富，三十年的开采，不过等于九牛之一毛，如果三十年后我们一切条件具备了，就可以完全自己来办了。又如关于两公司董事长（现为管理委员会主任）和总经理两职，过去苏方主张董事长由中国代表充任，总经理（是负实际权责的）一定要由苏方代表充任，而这次规定三年轮换一次，实行轮流负责制，这也是管理权用人权的平等。
    综合以上的分析，中苏在新疆的经济合作，特别是这两项资源的开发，实在是一个很适时的，非常必要的，也是最应该迅速开始进行的工作，明白了以上几点，就不会再有所怀疑；如果大家把四月五日北京人民日报社论《欢迎有利于中国经济建设的中苏经济合作》一文再读一遍，必更可增加了解了。
    在整个中苏经济合作说，这两项协定还只是个开端，我们热情地期望中苏在新疆的经济合作不久便可以扩展到西北五省，使整个西北成为全国最大的工业区，能够和苏联中央亚细亚的工业建设看齐，两个国防基地背靠着背地团结在一起，各自担负着伟大的祖国国防的神圣任务！
