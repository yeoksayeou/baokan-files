Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, on April 21st, delivered a note to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kirk, sternly refuting the U.S. government's unreasonable note in response to the Soviet government's protest regarding the intrusion of a U.S. aircraft into Soviet airspace on April 8th. In its note, belatedly presented on April 18th, the U.S. government arbitrarily denied that a U.S. military aircraft had intruded into Soviet airspace, insisted that the aircraft was unarmed, and falsely accused the Soviet aircraft of violating international law by allegedly firing on an unarmed U.S. aircraft over the high seas, demanding arrogantly that the Soviet Union compensate for the allegedly lost U.S. aircraft. According to TASS Moscow, April 22nd: The full text of the Soviet government's reply note is as follows:

	In response to the note presented by the Government of the United States of America on April 18th of this year, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to make the following statement: As stated in the Soviet government's note of April 11th, the American aircraft that violated the Soviet border south of Libau, according to irrefutable evidence, was a four-engine B-29 type military aircraft (Flying Fortress). This American aircraft not only failed to comply with the Soviet fighter planes' demand that it follow them to land at an airfield, but also opened fire on the Soviet aircraft. After the Soviet fighter plane in the lead was forced to return fire, the American aircraft fled towards the ocean. These are the facts, verified through proper investigation and proven to be accurate.

	The U.S. government's note of April 18th contains many unproven statements, all of which are refuted by conclusively proven facts.

	For example, the U.S. government claims in this note that the only U.S. military aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea region on April 8th was a U.S. Navy patrol plane. However, it has now been conclusively proven that a B-29 type aircraft (Flying Fortress) bearing U.S. insignia was flying in Soviet airspace south of Libau. The U.S. government insists that the aforementioned aircraft did not violate the Soviet border and was unarmed. However, according to irrefutable evidence possessed by the Soviet government, one U.S. B-29 type aircraft (Flying Fortress) violated the Soviet border in the Libau area on April 8th of this year, intruding 21 kilometers into Soviet airspace, and fired upon Soviet fighter planes.

	These facts completely refute the U.S. government's claims that the U.S. aircraft did not violate the Soviet border and that the aircraft was unarmed.

	In view of the aforementioned facts, the U.S. government's statement can only be regarded as an attempt to evade responsibility for blatant violations of international law.

	The U.S. government also declares in its note that it "demands that the strictest and most explicit instructions be issued to the Soviet Air Force" to avoid a recurrence of such incidents; that the responsibility for the incident that has occurred should be borne by the Soviet side; and that the latter should compensate for the damaged American aircraft.

	The Soviet government cannot agree to consider the above demands, as they are clearly improper and without foundation.

	It is not difficult to understand that any air force of any country, when its national border is violated by foreign aircraft and it must defend the inviolability of the national border, should act exactly as the Soviet Air Force did, without the slightest deviation.

	The U.S. government's note states that the U.S. aircraft that violated the Soviet border has crashed. The Soviet government has no information in this regard, but if the U.S. aircraft was indeed damaged, then the responsibility for its damage should be borne solely by those gentlemen who instructed the U.S. aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace, to film Soviet defense installations, thereby driving it to violate international law and infringe upon the inviolability of the Soviet border.

	As for the U.S. note's mention of issuing instructions to Soviet pilots, the appropriate instructions have long been in place and do not require any changes. These instructions are as follows: In the event that a foreign aircraft violates the Soviet border and intrudes into Soviet airspace, Soviet pilots have the responsibility to force it to land at a Soviet airfield, and if the foreign aircraft resists, they may fire upon it.

	Finally, the Soviet government deems it necessary to specifically remind of the fact that, as can be judged from the U.S. government's note of April 18th, the U.S. government is not providing an objective response to the Soviet government's note of April 11th, but is instead shielding the illegal actions of its subordinates, who have disgraced themselves by blatantly violating recognized rules of international law.

	In view of the above points, the Soviet government reiterates to the U.S. government its strong protest against the blatant intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into the Soviet border.

　　重申抗议美机非法侵犯领空
    苏联严词驳斥美复照
    揭露美政府狡辩旨在逃避责任
    【新华社二十二日讯】苏联外交部长维辛斯基于四月二十一日以照会一件递交美国驻苏大使寇克，驳复美国政府关于四月八日美机侵犯苏联领空一事答复苏联政府的无理照会。美国政府于迟至四月十八日始行提出的该项照会中，武断地否认美国军用机曾侵入苏联领空，硬说该机并无武装，并诬陷苏联飞机被迫向该美机还击一事为在公海上射击非武装美国飞机的违反国际法行为，狂妄要求苏联赔偿据说业已失踪的该美国飞机。据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：苏联政府答复照会的全文如下：
    为答复美利坚合众国政府本年四月十八日提出的照会，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为必须作如下声明：正如苏联政府四月十一日的照会所述，侵犯利巴雅南面苏联边疆的美国飞机，根据证实无误的材料，是一架四引擎的Ｂ—２９型军用机（飞行堡垒），这架美国飞机不但不遵从苏联战斗机要该机跟随它们在机场着陆的要求，而且还向苏联飞机开火。当在前列的苏联战斗机被迫还击之后，美国这架飞机即朝海洋方面逸去。这就是业经适当审查证明确凿的事实。
    美国政府四月十八日的照会载有许多未加证明的声明，这些声明均为业经确凿证明的事实所驳倒。
    例如美国政府在这一照会中宣称：四月八日在波罗的海地区上空飞行的唯一美国军用机，是一架美国海军巡逻机。可是，目前已确凿证明有一架带有美国徽号的Ｂ—２９型飞机（飞行堡垒）在利巴雅南面苏联领空飞行。美国政府硬说上述飞机并没有侵犯苏联边疆，并且是没有武装的。然而根据苏联政府拥有的经证实无误的材料，美国Ｂ—２９型飞机（飞行堡垒）一架于本年四月八日在利巴雅区侵犯苏联边疆，侵入苏联领空二十一公里，而且射击苏联战斗机。
    这些事实完全驳倒了美国政府所谓美国飞机并未侵犯苏联边疆以及该机没有武装的声明。
    鉴于上述事实，美国政府的声明只能被认为是企图逃避蛮横破坏国际法之责任。
    美国政府在其照会中还宣称：它“要求向苏联空军发布最严格而明确的训令”，以避免这类事件的重演；已发生的事件的责任应由苏联方面担负；而且后者应赔偿损毁的美国飞机。
    苏联政府不能同意考虑上述要求，因为它们显属不正当，并毫无根据。
    不难了解，任何国家的任何空军，在其祖国边疆受到外国飞机的侵犯而必须保卫国家边疆的不可侵犯性时，都应该毫厘不差地像苏联空军那样行动。
    美国政府的照会声言，侵犯苏联边界的美国飞机已经失事。苏联政府在这一方面没有任何材料，但如果美国飞机真的损毁的话，那末，其损毁的责任应由那些训令美国飞机侵入苏联领空，摄取苏联国防工事影片，从而驱使它破坏国际法和侵犯苏联边疆的不可侵犯性的先生们单独担负。
    至于美国照会所说向苏联飞行员发布训令一节，那末，确当的训令早就有了，而且不需要作任何改变。这个训令是这样的：在外国飞机一旦侵犯苏联边疆和侵入苏联领空时，苏联的飞行员有责任迫其在苏联机场着陆，而在外国飞机抵抗时，得向其开火。
    最后，苏联政府认为必须特别提醒一件事实，即：从美国政府四月十八日的照会可以判断出，美国政府不是对苏联政府四月十一日的照会作客观的答复，而是包庇其由于蛮横破坏公认的国际法规则而有失体面的下属的非法行动。
    鉴于上述各点，苏联政府向美国政府重申苏联政府坚决抗议美国军用机蛮横侵犯苏联边疆。
