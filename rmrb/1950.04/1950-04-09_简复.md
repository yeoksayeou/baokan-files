Brief Replies

To Comrade Zhang Furu:
    Regarding your letter suggesting blocking the waterway in the city wall opposite Taoranting to prevent bad people from entering and exiting, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has replied as follows:
    There were originally iron grates in the waterway cave, but because the gaps were relatively wide, they allowed one person to enter and exit (but if completely blocked, it would affect drainage during the rainy season), so they have now requested the Bureau of Public Works to make them denser.

To Editor Guan Jianjun:
    The question you raised has now been answered by the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government: 1. If you lost your credentials, you can have them reissued by the original school. 2. The government currently has no uniform regulations regarding the age limit for school enrollment.

To Editor Zheng Qunying:
    Regarding your question, the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has replied:
    In Beijing, there is only one art college, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, which has departments of painting, sculpture, applied arts, a general education class, and an art cadre training class.
    There is one new type of agricultural college, the Agricultural University, which has departments of agronomy, horticulture, entomology, plant pathology, forestry, agricultural chemistry, soil science, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and agricultural economics.
    For detailed information about the enrollment of these two schools, please pay attention to their future enrollment brochures.

　　简复张福如同志：
    你建议堵塞陶然亭对面城墙水道，以防坏人出入的来信，已经由北京市人民政府公安局答复如下：
    那里的水道洞里，本来有铁篦子，因空子较疏，可容一人出入（但假如完全堵塞，便会影响雨季泄水），所以他们现在已转请卫生工程局将它改密。   编者关建君：
    你所提的问题现已经中央人民政府教育部高等教育司答复：一、你遗失了证件，可找原校补发。二、各校入学年龄的限制，政府现尚无统一规定。   编者郑群英君：
    你的问题，现在已经由中央人民政府教育部高等教育司答复：
    在北京市的文艺高等学校，只有中央美术学院一所，分绘画系、雕塑系、实用美术系、普修班、美术干部训练班等。
    新型农业高等学校有农业大学一所，分农艺学系、园艺学系、昆虫学系、植物病理学系、森林学系、农业化学系、土壤学系、畜牧学系、兽医学系、农业经济系等。
    关于这两个学校的招生详细情形，请你注意它们将来的招生简章。
