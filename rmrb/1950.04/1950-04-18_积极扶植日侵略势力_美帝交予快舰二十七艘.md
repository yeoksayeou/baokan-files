　　Actively Supporting Japanese Aggression Forces
    US Imperialism Hands Over Twenty-Seven Fast Ships
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] TASS, 16th: All twenty-seven naval escort fast ships that the Soviet Union obtained from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act during the war against Hitlerite Germany and returned to the US government in 1949 have recently been transferred by the US government to the Japanese authorities, forming the core of the future Japanese navy. The personnel on these escort fast ships are former Japanese naval officers commanded by Rear Admiral Komura. Komura's command consists of four or five operations officers and two engineering officers, including Colonel Miyazaki, Colonel Saito, Colonel Yasukawa, and Colonel Koshida. Koshida is a specialist in Chinese espionage. The personnel on the escort fast ships were personally selected by Rear Admiral Komura.
