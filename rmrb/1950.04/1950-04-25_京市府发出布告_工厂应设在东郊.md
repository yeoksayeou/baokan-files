　　Beijing Municipal Government Issues Proclamation:
    Factories Should Be Located in the Eastern Suburbs
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To facilitate the development of industry in the city, construct factories in a planned manner, and ensure the tranquility and safety of citizens' residences, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has issued a proclamation deciding that, in principle, all factories (whether public or private) should be located in the eastern suburban industrial zone. If small factories, due to capital and transportation constraints, genuinely face difficulties, they may, upon approval, be temporarily located in the following two areas: (1) Outside the Third District, east of Ciqikou on Chongwai Avenue, north of Beigangzi East Banbi Street on Fahuasi Street, west of the eastern city wall, and south of the northern city wall. (2) Outside the Fourth District, west of Da'er Hutong Xia Xie Street and Niujie, north of Zaolinqian Street, east of the western city wall, and south of the northern city wall. However, factories producing explosives, noxious odors, or flammable materials must be located in the eastern suburban industrial zone. Except for the aforementioned locations, no new factories exceeding three horsepower may be established anywhere else within the city. Existing factory buildings within the city are temporarily permitted to continue operation. If there are plans for expansion in the future, such development should be directed towards the designated areas. Anyone newly establishing a factory or expanding an old one must first submit the factory site to the Municipal Industrial and Construction Bureaus for approval; otherwise, they will be penalized for illegal business operations or illegal construction and may be ordered to suspend operations or change the use of the building.
