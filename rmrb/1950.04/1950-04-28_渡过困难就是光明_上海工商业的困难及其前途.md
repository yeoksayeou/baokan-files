　　Overcoming Difficulties Leads to Light
    ——The Difficulties and Future of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce
    Special Correspondent for this newspaper: He Li
  (III) Not Pessimistic
    Some believe that the difficulties of Shanghai's industry and commerce are mainly due to taxes and public bonds, but this is not the case.
    First, although Shanghai's industrialists and businessmen have experienced temporary financial difficulties, the overall social funds are not in short supply. According to the People's Bank of China, deposits in both public and private banks in Shanghai have increased significantly compared to the past. In March, the deposits in state-owned banks (People's, China, and Communications Banks) totaled 928.2 billion, an increase of 298.6 billion compared to February. Deposits in joint public-private banks (including Xinhua, China Industrial, Siming, and Tongshang Banks) were 145 billion, an increase of 93.5 billion compared to the 51.5 billion of the previous month. Deposits in private banks during the same period were 470.8 billion, also an increase of 220 billion compared to the 250.8 billion of the previous month. The total deposits in Shanghai's public and private banks reached 1,544.4 billion. The increase in these deposits shows that the fundamental reason for the lack of funds in the industrial and commercial sectors in March was not a lack of capital, but a severe contraction of credit. Once prices stabilize and credit gradually recovers, under the leadership of the state-owned banks, these funds can be used for production, and then the industrial and commercial sectors will not have to worry about a lack of capital.
    Second, during this month, the original market in Shanghai was basically in a state of shrinkage. However, another good phenomenon appeared in the market: except for high-end consumer goods, the retail market for commodities that meet the needs of the general public did not shrink. According to the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the turnover of Lihua Company, one of the six major companies, increased significantly in March compared to the previous month. The reason is that Lihua Company has paid attention to selling popular commodities. This shows that the broad masses still have a certain purchasing power even now. As long as the industrial and commercial sectors can develop in the direction of popularization, they will gradually find their future. If the purchasing power of farmers is liberated, the situation will be even better.
  (IV) Some Industries Cannot Be Maintained as They Were
    Yes, some industries and businesses have collapsed today. We should maintain those that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so that they can continue to survive. However, some businesses that do not meet the needs of the people or are even harmful to the people cannot be maintained and should be transformed. For example, some rice merchants who used to engage in speculation and hoarding are now being eliminated, which is a good thing, and the broad masses of the people are getting a normal supply of rice. This kind of elimination is in line with the interests of the people. Also, some banks and money houses that rely on usury and speculation to make profits are like mole crickets lurking beside the roots of the industrial sector, harming production. According to a survey, from June 14th of last year to the end of January this year, prices rose 17.4 times, while interest rates compounded every three days rose 57 times, and interest rates compounded every seven days rose 49.5 times (the so-called "three-day compound interest" and "seven-day compound interest" mean that interest is calculated on the principal plus interest every three or seven days). For example, if 1 billion yuan was owed on October 3rd of last year, the principal plus interest would be more than 7.8 billion yuan by the end of January, calculated at a seven-day compound interest rate. Calculated at a three-day compound interest rate, the principal plus interest would be more than 9.6 billion yuan. By the end of December last year, 30 private yarn factories in Shanghai owed 37 billion yuan to banks and money houses, which caused interest to account for a large part of the cost, making the cost of many industries higher than the market price. This kind of industry should not continue as it was. Furthermore, some high-end consumer businesses, such as many large hotels, restaurants, and dance halls, used to depend on foreign colonialists, bureaucratic capitalists, and feudal warlords and landlords for their survival. Today, these people have fallen, and the broad masses of the working people do not need these things at present, so they must transform. Finally, there are also some industries that, although abstractly speaking, are needed by the people, are in fact in a state of absolute oversupply due to the anarchy of production, such as the excessive number of match and cigarette industries. These surplus parts also urgently need to be adjusted.
  (V) Legitimate Industry and Commerce Must Be Maintained
    During the great transformation of the old and new economic relations, we cannot let this trend develop on its own. We should maintain those that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so as to await future development. We should transform legitimate industries and businesses that have shortcomings to suit the needs of the people. Even for those that should not exist, we should not let them eat and spend everything, but rather lead them to change careers.
  (VI) The Correct Path - Serving the People
    Today, the industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai should recognize the methods to overcome difficulties. In addition to the necessary efforts by the government, the industrial and commercial sectors themselves should make the following efforts: First, support the front line and liberate Taiwan, because the blockade is the main root cause of Shanghai's current difficulties. To this end, we should strive to complete the tasks of tax collection and public bonds. Second, recognize the situation and work hard to produce. We should unreservedly take out funds, increase capital, enhance confidence, maintain our own businesses, and resolutely transform operations that do not meet the needs of the people. Third, improve production management. Some factories in Shanghai are poorly managed and waste a lot. According to the materials of the East China Finance and Economics Committee in November and December of last year, the management fees and factory fees of factories such as Chongxin, Shenliu, Shenqi in the yarn industry and the match industry were almost the same as wages. In the future, we must be careful in our calculations, practice streamlining and frugality, reduce costs, and improve quality, so that we can achieve normal development. Fourth, we should change our business direction. In the past, many industries and businesses were operated for foreign colonialists and domestic comprador bureaucrats and landlords. Today, we must face the people and serve the people, which is the only way out. In addition to the example of Lihua Company mentioned earlier, the Western-style clothing industry is also an example. Among the 248 Western-style clothing businesses in Shanghai, 54 have closed down, only 12 have difficulties and cannot be maintained, 140 have difficulties but can be maintained, and 42 are doing well. The reason for the good performance is that they have changed their business policy, not making Western-style fashions, but making "People's Suits." On the contrary, stores like Lao Jiuhe Silk and Satin, which do not increase investment or change their business policies, are facing serious problems. This shows that only meeting the needs of the people is the way out.
    The most important issue at present is how to change the direction of industry and commerce to face the domestic market and the countryside. This requires the joint efforts of the People's Government, workers, and the industrial and commercial sectors. Shanghai has achieved great success in the struggle against blockade and bombing. Since the bandit aircraft bombing on February 6, the electricity supply has encountered great difficulties. Through the joint efforts of everyone, the electricity supply is now sufficient to meet the needs of industrial production. This creates a prerequisite for the production of our factories. The main issues to be solved at present are three: (1) In terms of sales, sales are inevitably reduced due to the current off-season and last year's disaster. However, everyone should organize themselves to find a way out. For example, in foreign trade, in addition to the successful organization of the East China Trade Department to transfer Shanghai commodities to Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places for export, it has now started direct trade between Shanghai and Hong Kong by land, which has a great effect on the export of Shanghai products and the import of necessary raw materials. (2) Regarding the issue of raw materials, before liberation, Shanghai relied on foreign countries for many raw materials. After liberation, we have basically adopted the path of self-reliance, and many raw materials have been solved by ourselves, but some are still very lacking. In the future, we should study substitutes. It is still necessary to absorb some foreign goods (such as raw cotton) within a possible range. (3) We should find ways to resolve labor-capital relations. On the one hand, the capitalists should increase their confidence, increase capital, and overcome difficulties; on the other hand, workers should appropriately reduce wages and improve efficiency in necessary circumstances to reduce production costs.
    Shanghai workers have had successful experience in overcoming difficulties and maintaining production together with the capitalists through consultation. This should be vigorously promoted.

　　渡过困难就是光明
    ——上海工商业的困难及其前途
    本报特派记者  贺笠
  （三）并不悲观
    有人认为上海工商业的困难，主要是由于税收公债，事实上并不如此。
    第一、上海工商业者一时虽发生了资金的困难，然而就整个社会资金来看并不是困难的。据人民银行的材料，上海公私银行的存款均比过去大有增加。三月份国家银行（人民、中国、交通）存款共达九千二百八十二亿，较二月份增加了二千九百八十六亿。公私合营银行（包括新华、中国实业、四明、通商四行）存款一千四百五十亿，较上月的五百一十五亿增加九百三十五亿。私人银行同期存款四千七百零八亿，亦较上月二五○八亿增加二千二百亿。上海公私银行共存款一万五千四百四十亿。从这批存款的增加，说明三月份工商界资金的缺乏，基本原因不是没有资金，而是信用的极度紧缩。只要物价稳定之后，信用日渐恢复，在国家银行的领导之下，这些资金都可能运用到生产事业上，那时工商界不愁没有资金的。
    第二、在这一个月当中上海原来的市场基本是萎缩状态。但是市场上也出现了另外一种好现象，除了高级消费品之外，凡符合于一般人民需要的零售商品市场并不缩小。据工商局的消息，六大公司之一的丽华公司三月份营业额较上月大有增加。其原因就是丽华公司已经注意发售大众化的商品。这就说明了广大群众即使在现在仍有一定的购买力。工商业界只要能向大众化的方向发展就会逐渐找到自己的前途。如果农民的购买力解放了，情况就会更好。
  （四）有些行业是不能原样维持的
    是的，今天有些工商业是倒下去了，我们对于那些有利于国计民生工商业的倒闭应当予以维持，使其能继续生存，但对于有些不合人民需要的事业甚至有害于人民的事业是不能再维持的，应使他们转业。比如：有一部分在过去专门囤积居奇的米商，今天被淘汰下去，是应该的，广大人民反而得到食米的正常供应。这种淘汰是符合人民利益的。又如，有些依靠高利贷投机牟利的银行钱庄，它们像蝼蛄一样潜伏在工业界的根旁残害生产。据调查自去年六月十四日至今年一月底物价上升十七点四倍。而利率三天复利上升五十七倍，七天复利上升四十九点五倍（所谓“三天复利”“七天复利”就是借款经过三天或七天就要以复利息计算一次）。如去年十月三日欠债十亿元，照七天复利计算至一月底，本利和即为七十八亿多。三天复利，本利和则为九十六亿多。至去年十二月底，上海有三十家私营纱厂欠行庄款三七○亿，因而使利息占据成本很大的一部分，使得很多行业的成本均高于市价。这种行业是不应当原样继续的。再如，有些高级消费事业，如许多大旅馆、大饭店、跳舞厅，过去都是依附于外国的殖民者、官僚资本家以及封建军阀地主等而生存的，今天这些人都倒下去了，广大的劳苦人民目前并不需要这些东西，他们是不能不转变的。最后，还有一些行业虽然抽象地看来是人民所需要的，具体地看来却因为生产无政府状态而形成绝对的供过于求，例如过多的火柴业和卷烟业。这些多余的部分也急需加以调整。
  （五）对正当的工商业必须维持
    在新旧经济关系发生大转化的时候，我们不能让这种趋势自流地发展，凡对于国计民生有利的应当加以维持，以待将来发展。正当工商业中有缺点的应加以改造，使适合人民的需要。即对不应存在的也不是任其吃光花光，而是领导他们转业。
  （六）正确的道路——为人民服务
    今天上海工商界应该认识克服困难的办法，除政府应有必要的努力之外，工商界自身应作下列的努力：第一、支援前线，解放台湾。因为封锁是上海目前困难的主要根源。为此，应努力完成税收与公债任务。第二、认清形势，努力生产。应该无保留地拿出资金，增加资本，提高信心，维持自己的事业，不合人民需要的经营应坚决转业。第三、改善生产管理。上海有些工厂由于管理不善，浪费颇大。据华东财委会去年十一、十二两月的材料，如纱厂中之崇信、申六、申七等厂及火柴业的管理费、厂务费竟与工资相差无几。今后必须精打细算，厉行精简节约，减低成本，提高质量，然后才能获得正常的发展。第四、应改变自己的营业方向，过去许多工商业是为了外国殖民者和本国买办官僚、地主而经营的，今天就必须面向人民，为人民服务，这才是出路。除了前面丽华公司的例子以外，衣着业中的西服店也是一个例子。在上海二百四十八家西服业当中，除已倒闭的五十四家，有困难而不能维持的只有十二家，有困难能维持的有一百四十家，营业好的有四十二家。好的原因，就是改变营业方针，不做西服时装，而做“人民装”了。相反的如老九和绸缎店，既不增加投资，也不改变营业方针，所以问题就严重了。这说明只有适合人民的需要才是出路。
    目前最主要的问题是如何改变工商业的方向，使之面向国内，面向农村。这是要人民政府、工人、工商界共同来作的。上海反封锁反轰炸斗争都已取得很大的成绩。自二月六日匪机轰炸以后，电力曾遭受到很大的困难。经过大家的共同努力，现在电力已足供应各工业生产的需要。这就给我们各工厂生产造成前提。当前主要应解决的问题有三：（一）在销路方面，目前因处于淡月，又加去年灾荒，销路难免减少。但大家应组织起来力谋出路。如对外贸易，华东贸易部除组织上海商品转口到天津、青岛等地输出获得成功外，现又开始沪港间陆运的直接贸易，这对上海产品输出与必要原料的输入均有很大的作用。（二）原料问题，上海在解放前许多原料均仰给外国。解放以后，我们基本是采取自力更生的道路，许多原料均已自己解决，但有的还很缺乏，今后应研究代用品。在可能范围内吸收一些外货（如原棉），仍属必要。（三）应设法解决劳资关系。一方面资方应提高信心，增加资本克服困难；而另一方面工人在必要情形下应适当降低工资，提高效率，以降低生产成本。
    上海工人用协商方式，与资方共同克服困难，维持生产，已有成功的经验。这是应当努力提倡的。
