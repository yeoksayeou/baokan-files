　　Introducing the Automatic Time Signal of the Central People's Broadcasting Station
    Huang Yun
    The Central People's Broadcasting Station announces the time every hour on the hour. Previously, the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast a fixed musical piece two or three minutes before the hour, and then struck a sounding board according to the second hand of a stopwatch, with the last strike being the exact hour. From seeing the second hand move to the final strike, there could be a time difference of two or three seconds. For the sake of greater scientific accuracy, the station has switched from striking the sounding board manually to automatically since April 10th. The time will not be off by even a tenth of a second, which is much more accurate than manual operation.
    The automatic time signal of the Central People's Broadcasting Station is five short whistle sounds, starting five seconds before the hour. The first four sounds are the same, and the fifth sound is an octave higher than the previous four, marking the exact hour.
    The whistle sound is produced by connecting a voltage regulator to a fixed voltage, and then using capacitors with different capacitances and resistors to match the appropriate charging and discharging time to generate the required low-frequency oscillation sound. Its working time is controlled by a synchronous motor. It only starts working thirty seconds before each time signal, so the timing is quite accurate and reliable.
    The time announced by the Central People's Broadcasting Station is calculated according to Greenwich Mean Time. Now I will introduce this calculation method:
    The Earth's rotation is one day. For the convenience of calculating time and indicating position, the Earth is divided into 360 degrees along a circle, which is longitude. The common practice is to start at the Greenwich Observatory in the United Kingdom as zero degrees, and divide into East and West longitude, each 180 degrees from Greenwich to the left and right. Because the Earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours, which is 1,440 minutes; therefore, for every degree difference, the time difference is four minutes, which means that for every 15 degrees, the difference is one hour. For the convenience of calculation and application, the common practice is to define the fifteen-degree area of seven and a half degrees to the left and right of Greenwich as the standard time zone; then, starting from seven and a half degrees, calculate a time zone every fifteen degrees to the east and west longitude. For every fifteen degrees east longitude, the time is one hour earlier, and for every fifteen degrees west longitude, the time is one hour later. For example, Beijing is at 116 degrees east longitude and should belong to the Central Plains time zone of 120 degrees, so it is eight hours earlier than Greenwich Mean Time, that is, when it is zero o'clock in Greenwich, it is eight o'clock in Beijing. With such regulations, it is not difficult to calculate the standard time difference in various parts of the world.

　　介绍中央人民广播电台的自动报时法
    黄云
    中央人民广播电台，每一个正点都报时一次。以前中央人民广播电台报时是在正点前二三分钟播送一张固定音乐片，然后根据停表的秒针，敲击音板，最后一声就是正点。从看到秒针的转动，到敲最后一响，时间上可能有二三秒钟的差误。为了更科学更准确起见，四月十日起该台已将敲音板改成自动，时间就不会差到十分之一秒，比较手动要准确得多了。
    中央人民广播电台的自动报时是五声短的笛声，从正点的前五秒钟开始响起，接连四声，第五声比前四声高八度音阶，时间是正点。
    笛声是用电压稳定管接在固定的电压上，再由不同电容量的蓄电器，及电阻配合成适当的充放电时间，以产生需要的低周率振荡声音，它的工作时间，是由同期电动机来控制的，每次报时在前三十秒才开始工作，时间上是相当准确可靠的。
    中央人民广播电台所报的时间，是根据格林威治时间计算出来的。现在我把这种算法介绍一下：
    地球自转一周就是一天。为了计算时刻和指明位置便利起见，按照圆周将地球东西分成了三百六十度，这就是经度。一般习惯上以英国格林威治天文台起作零度，从格林威治向左和向右各分成东经和西经一百八十度。因为地球自转三百六十度，需要二十四小时，也就是一千四百四十分；所以每差一度，时间就差四分钟，也就是每隔十五度，相差一小时。为了计算及应用的方便，一般习惯上定格林威治向左和向右各七度半的十五度的区域，作为标准时区；然后从七度半起，向东经及西经每隔十五度算一个时区，东经每加十五度，时间早一小时，西经每加十五度，时间晚一小时。例如北京是在东经一百一十六度，应当属于一百二十度的中原时区，所以比格林威治时间要早八小时，也就是格林威治时间零点的时候，北京是八点钟。有了这样的规定，就不难将世界各地的标准时差计算出来。
