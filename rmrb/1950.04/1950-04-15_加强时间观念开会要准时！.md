Strengthen the Sense of Time, Be Punctual for Meetings!
Comrade Editor:
　　Recently, I have encountered several gatherings that did not start on time, each time delaying by an hour or several tens of minutes. For example, the Nine Districts of Beijing held a March 8th Women's Day celebration and film screening at the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, which resulted in five or six thousand women and children waiting from 5 or 6 pm until almost 8 pm for the meeting to begin. Because there were so many people, it was difficult to maintain order, and with the strong wind, the meeting did not go well, and the film was not shown, wasting several hours for thousands of people.
　　The report of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League last week, and the special report at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall last Sunday (the 9th), were both delayed for a considerable amount of time. If a meeting of several hundred to a thousand people is delayed by one or two hours per person, it will delay a lot of work. Although some people will make use of the time by bringing books and newspapers to read, or having casual conversations with relevant comrades about study issues and exchanging work experience, I still feel that it is better to follow Chairman Mao's instruction of "not fighting unprepared battles, not holding unprepared meetings". I hope this short article can be published in "People's Forum" so that everyone can strengthen their sense of time and develop the habit of being punctual for meetings!

### 加强时间观念开会要准时！

　　加强时间观念开会要准时！编者同志：
    近来我遇到几次集会，都没有准时进行，每次都要耽误一点钟或几十分钟。如京市九区在师大附中操场举行三八妇女节纪念会并放映电影，结果叫五六千妇女和儿童，从下午五六点钟等到快八点才开会；因为人多，会场秩序不易维持，又括大风，结果弄得会也没有开好，电影也没有演成，几千人白白耽误几点钟。
    前星期京市团工委的报告，前星期日（九日）中山公园音乐堂的专题报告都耽误了不少时间。如果几百人至一千人的会，每人耽误一两小时，就要耽误许多工作，虽然有些人会利用时间，带着书报看；或与有关的同志漫谈学习问题和交流工作经验但我总觉得应遵照毛主席所指示的“不打无准备的仗，不开无准备的会”来得好。希望这篇短文能在《人民园地》上发表，使大家加强时间观念，养成准时开会的习惯！
