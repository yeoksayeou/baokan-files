Reading the Three Poems "I Want His Grain to Pile Up Like a Mountain" and Others

Today, after reading the three short poems, "I Want His Grain to Pile Up Like a Mountain" and others, in the 45th issue of People's Literature and Art, I couldn't help but exclaim: "Wonderful, wonderful! These three poems are so true and so beautiful!" I believe they must have many admirers, and their value and techniques are worth recommending to everyone.

First, let's talk about the first poem, "I Want His Grain to Pile Up Like a Mountain." The author begins by writing about the hardworking and joyful scene of the peasants after they have been distributed land:

"Outside the window, the rooster crows at the third watch of the night,"...
"The eldest son just married a new wife,"...

Hard work is the inherent quality of Chinese peasants, but before liberation, they lived like oxen and horses, unable to eat their fill or dress warmly. Although they also worked from the fifth watch of the night until dusk, their emotions were always low. Now, when the donkey brays at the fourth watch, and the sky is not yet bright, he "hurries to get up and put on his clothes" to prepare to go to the fields to work. Although it is the same hard work, there is joy in the hard work. After being distributed land, the harvest years are good, so "the eldest son just married a new wife," and although the father-in-law wants to wake up the eldest son first, when he sees "the door bolted and sleeping soundly," he changes his mind and calls the "second son" who is "only fourteen." In a few short strokes, the "true feelings" of the peasants are written simply and without exaggeration.

The second, third, and fourth sections are about how all the villagers are devoted to the fields of production, and the mood of work is that "everyone is working harder than the other," "the sweat on their bodies is soaking their jackets," "the sweat on their faces is dripping in front of their feet," "working until the sun goes down," and "working until the stars fill the sky."

In the fourth section, the author points out the reason why the peasants are working so hard:

"This land is our land,
This sky is our sky;
Why should we be stingy with our strength and sweat!
Just wait for autumn this year,
And work hard for a good harvest!"

The second poem, "Spring Colors in the Countryside," is especially endearing. The whole poem is divided into four chapters, depicting the joyful scene of peasants producing in the countryside after the land reform.

In the first line of the first chapter, the author first points out the arrival of spring in the countryside: "A gust of warm wind carries the fragrance of plum blossoms." The warm wind of spring is welcomed earliest by the peasants in the countryside. "Peach, plum, and apricot blossoms are all of the spring family," but the plum blossoms bloom the latest, and are considered the third generation compared to apricot and peach blossoms. This is the season when "the days are getting longer and the sun is getting warmer," and the peasants are starting to work hard. Their mood for work is obviously different from before the land reform. They are not only well-fed and well-clothed, but also building their own new houses:

"Making adobe bricks, mixing mud,
Humming and hawing, pounding the earth with a ram.
Here they shout to erect the pillars,
There they shout to put up the beams.
The turned-over peasants have a good life,
Mutual aid and cooperation to build new houses!"

In addition to writing about the new atmosphere of the peasants after they have turned over, the author also cleverly uses the peasants' spoken language (such as: humming and hawing, pounding the earth with a ram) and combines it with the peasants' thoughts and emotions. As Chairman Mao said at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "...Our literary and art workers' own thoughts and emotions should be integrated with the thoughts and emotions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. And to achieve this integration, we should start by learning the language of the masses..." The author grasped this point, and used the peasants' natural language to write it truthfully and without any embellishment, which is so vivid, lively, and powerful!

In the second, third, and fourth chapters, the author uses the folk song forms "Big yellow ox, smooth and shiny," "Little donkey, as black as iron," to write about the peasants' labor enthusiasm and joy in delivering manure and drawing water. Putting new stories into folk song forms is of great help in terms of acceptance and understanding for the peasants.

In the third poem, "Flower for Flower," the author uses dialogue to write about the happy mood of two sisters participating in sideline production and the thoughts of girls. What thoughts? Also the thoughts that girls often have – marriage. Liberated women have different ideas about choosing a partner and the way they get married; they love the labor heroes who are "counted in the militia regiment" and "do not rest during the afternoon break."

The younger sister is still quite young after all, and is not very clear about why her older sister has "repeatedly delayed" her wedding date. So she asks her sister suspiciously:

"The whole village is looking forward to drinking wedding wine,
You have repeatedly delayed it;
The honeydew melon falls from the vine and is not picked,
What are you two up to?"

The reason why the older sister and her fiancé have repeatedly delayed the wedding date is not for anything else, but because:

"This year we are launching a major production drive,
In the fall, we will select models;
Water flows low and people walk high,
Who doesn't want to be the top student?"

She is because she and her fiancé have "picked a fight" and are "waiting to win the model in the fall." When the two of them are selected as models and "sent to the county with much fanfare," the young couple will "sit side by side at the labor model conference, with two red flowers hanging on their chests;... The young people take them as examples, gesturing and making vows." At that time, "the hero's wine will become heartfelt wine, and the celebration banquet will become a wedding banquet. The county chief and the county committee will witness the marriage, and we will wear flowers for flowers on our chests!"

Through this story (even if it is only a few short lines of dialogue), we not only see the author's skillful writing techniques; he also gives us a new inspiration - the new era produces new ideas and new things. In order to compete for production heroes and labor models, for the long-term interests of all the people (including one's own interests), personal temporary happiness is not spared. This way of marriage and Gu Yu's novel "New Things Done in a New Way" simultaneously express the new thoughts of the new Chinese daughters. This kind of thinking is worth advocating and promoting.

I like these three short poems, so I specially bring them up to recommend and introduce to everyone.

### 读《我要他粮食堆成山》等三首诗

专栏：

　　读《我要他粮食堆成山》等三首诗
    今天读了人民文艺四十五期《我要他粮食堆成山》等三首小诗，不禁高叫起来：“好啊，好啊！这三首诗写的多真，多美！”我相信它们一定是有许多喜爱者的，它们的价值与技巧值得向大家推荐。
    先谈第一首《我要他粮食堆成山》。作者劈头先写出分得土地后农民的勤劳、欢欣的景象：
    “窗外头鸡叫三更天，”……
    “大小子才娶了新媳妇，”……
    勤劳本来是中国农民的本色，但在解放前，他们是过着吃不饱、穿不暖的牛马似的生活的。他们虽也是起五更，搭黄昏的工作着，可是情绪始终是低落的。如今，驴叫四更，天还没大亮，他就“急忙起来把衣穿”，准备下地做活了。虽是同样的辛勤，然而辛勤中则有他的快乐。分得土地之后，年景好了，于是“大小子才娶了新媳妇，”作公公的虽然有心先把大儿子喊醒，但他一看“闩着屋门睡得甜；”就改变了主意，去喊“才十四”的“二小子”了。简短的几笔，朴实地毫不夸张地写出了农民的“真情味”。
    第二、三、四节是写的全村人民都投入了生产的原野，工作的情绪是“一个比一个干得欢，”是“身上的汗湿透了袄，”是“脸上的汗滴脚前，”是“做到太阳落下去，”“做到星星出满天。”
    第四节作者点出农民努力干活的原因：
    “这地是咱们的地，
    这天是咱们的天；
    咱们还惜什么力和汗！
    单等今年秋天到，
    干出来一个好丰年！”
    第二首《农村春色》，格外逗人喜爱。全诗分四章，写土改后的农村的农民一片喜气洋洋的生产景象。
    首章第一句，作者先点出农村之春来：“阵阵暖风李花香，”春天的暖风只有乡村的农民迎接的最早。“桃李杏春风一家”，但李花开的最晚，和杏、桃花比起来算是第三辈。这时正是“天渐长，日正暖”，农民们开展劳动干活的季节，他们干活的情绪也显然和土改前不同了。他们不但丰衣足食，而且在建筑起他们自己的新屋了：
    “打土坯，合泥浆，
    哼啊，嗳呀，砸大夯。
    这边喊竖柱，
    那边喊上梁。
    翻身农民光景好，
    互助合作盖新房！”
    作者除了写出农民翻身后的新气象外，他又灵活地利用了农民口语（如：哼啊，嗳呀，砸大夯。）和农民的思想情绪结合在一起。正如毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上讲的：“……我们的文艺工作者自己的思想情绪应与工农兵大众的思想情绪打成一片。而要打成一片，应从学习群众的言语开始……”作者把握了这一点，利用农民的自然的言语毫不雕琢地照实写出来，是那末的生动、活泼、有力呵！
    第二、三、四三章，作者用民歌形式“大黄牛，水溜溜。”“小毛驴，似铁青，”写出了农民送粪、车水的劳动热情与欢快。把新的故事装入民歌的形式中，这对于农民接受与了解方面是有很大帮助的。
    第三首“花换花”，作者用对话形式写出了两姊妹参加生产副业的愉快情绪和女儿家的心思。什么心思？也是女儿家常有的心思——婚姻问题。解放了的妇女，她们对于选择对象和结婚时的方式想法不同了；她们爱着“民兵团里数着他”，“歇晌的时候不休息”的劳动英雄了。
    妹妹的年纪毕竟还小些，对于姐姐“几番延迟”结婚佳期不大了然。她于是怀疑地问姐姐了：
    “全庄上盼着喝喜酒，
    你们几番来延迟；
    甜瓜落蛋不去摘，
    你们打的啥主意？”
    姐姐和她的未婚夫所以要一再延迟婚期者，他们的主意不是别的，而是为了：
    “今年开展大生产，
    秋后就要选模范；
    水流低来人走高，
    那一个不想当状元？”
    她是因为和未婚夫“挑了战”，“单等秋天夺模范”的。等到两人都被选为模范，被“吹吹打打送到县；”那时小俩口儿“劳模会上并排坐，两朵红花胸上悬；……青年们拿着当榜样，比手划脚立誓愿。”那时“英雄酒变成交心酒，庆功筵变成结婚筵。县长县委来证婚，我们要花换花来带胸前！”
    通过这个故事（那怕是短短的几句对白，）我们不但看出作者写作技巧的熟练；他更给予我们一个新的启示——新的时代产生着新的思想、新的事物。为了要争夺生产英雄，劳动模范，为了长远的全人民的利益（自己的利益也在内）个人的暂时的幸福是不惜牺牲的。这种结婚的方式和谷峪的“新事新办”那篇小说，同时表现了新中国女儿的新思想。这种思想是值得提倡、发扬的。
    我喜欢这三首小诗，特提出来向大家推荐、介绍。
    五○，四，二三·北京西苑革大。
