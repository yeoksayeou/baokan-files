　　Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Publishing
　　Yan Ru
　　Since the liberation of Shanghai, Wuhan, and other cities last year, China's publishing industry has gradually begun to fully activate. Shanghai has always been the center of the national publishing industry, and currently the number of publishers and the types of new publications are still the highest in Shanghai. The second is the capital Beijing and Tianjin, and Shenyang and Dalian in the Northeast. In addition, there are book publications in Jinan in the East China region, and Wuhan and Guangzhou in the Central South region. As far as the types of new publications are concerned, although there are no reliable statistics, judging from the book advertisements in newspapers and the situation in general bookstore outlets, in addition to the Marxist-Leninist documents, Chairman Mao's works, and government documents printed by Xinhua Bookstore, the main ones include Soviet introductions, literature and art (including translations of Soviet literature), social science pamphlets, etc., followed by new nomenclature dictionaries, new comic strips, worker-peasant reading materials, learning manuals, and learning materials, etc. However, books published before liberation still account for the majority of books circulating in the market. In terms of the quality of new publications, some publications of state-owned bookstores are perfunctory and not up to standard, and although some private bookstores are working more conscientiously, in general, they are considered not conscientious enough. Many books are not only of poor political standard, but also of low cultural standard. Translations are mostly perfunctory, and there are not many trustworthy ones. It is said that a certain publishing house, in order to rush to publish translations, disassembled the original publication as soon as it found materials that could be translated, divided them among several people to translate, and could translate and print it within a few days. Naturally, the quality of such crudely made things would not be very good. In addition, reprinting documents and compiling learning materials are mostly chaotic. Moreover, the same text is often selected in several different anthologies with different book titles, which is a waste. This situation can often be seen in the publications of Xinhua bookstores in various places. Judging from the current situation of the entire publishing industry, it is obvious that there is still a chaotic phenomenon of unplanned, aimless, and blind production.
　　Why does such a chaotic situation still exist in our publishing industry? We believe that the main reasons are nothing more than the following two: First, the old habits formed by our publishing industry over the past many years are deeply rooted and difficult to change in a short period of time. The practice of pursuing profits and carrying out production without a plan is obviously not in line with the requirements of the new era. Even during the Kuomintang rule, the progressive publishing industry, which had a history of struggle, inevitably became contaminated with some less rigorous practices in the past. Now, some publishers subjectively do not want to do a good job, but because they still cannot have a thorough understanding of the nature of the people's publishing business, they still cannot completely abandon the old set of practices. That is to say, the current chaotic situation in the publishing industry is a residual phenomenon of the publishing industry in the old era. Secondly, in terms of the state-owned publishing industry, although Xinhua Bookstore has a history of ten years, it used to be scattered in various regions for independent operations in the old liberated areas, and the material conditions at that time were so difficult. Therefore, in terms of policies, organization, and business, it has long existed, more or less, a situation of acting independently. Today, it has just begun to move towards a unified path throughout the country, and it cannot quickly improve its work. At the same time, it cannot play a better role in demonstrating and assisting the national private publishing industry.
　　"Develop the people's publishing industry" is clearly stipulated in the Common Program, and the people's publishing industry will surely receive the attention and support of the country. However, in the publishing industry, we must first make various efforts from ourselves and must not have a psychology of dependence. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government implemented a method of allocating foreign exchange to purchase paper in the publishing industry. This method, on the surface, seems to be beneficial to the publishing industry, but as long as you think about it a little, you can know that this benefit was originally the leftover bit of blood and sweat squeezed from the people of the whole country by the reactionary government. The people's government, which takes the interests of the vast people as the premise, must not do this. Today, our publishers must recognize that publishing work is a part of the entire revolutionary work, that is, a part of the entire national construction work, and must cooperate with the country's overall principles and policies to do it conscientiously, so that their career is truly a career of serving the people. Minister Lu Dingyi of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said in his closing speech at the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference last year: "The publishing industry that serves the people has a future... The difference between our publishing industry and the old publishing industry is that it unconditionally serves the people. The interests of the people's liberation cause are the only interests for us. Regardless of whether the bookstore makes money or loses money, whether personal enjoyment is good or bad, we must serve the people. The people's publishing workers, under the rule of the Kuomintang, even did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for the interests of the people. ...Xinhua Bookstore and Sanlian Bookstore are examples of this publishing business, and outstanding publishing workers across the country will follow this path forward." Minister Lu's words were addressed to the workers of Xinhua Bookstore. These words, today, seem to be a bit too high-sounding for general publishers, but we believe that in the near future, publishing workers will understand the meaning of these words and "follow this path forward." At the same time, the entire social environment is also urging publishers to move forward. Once any region is liberated, cadres at all levels of public and private institutions and organizations, teachers and students in schools, and even the general public of citizens, workers, and peasants, learning and further education have become a trend. The political standards of the people have generally been significantly improved, and the cultural standards are also gradually increasing. The reader group's requirements for the quality of books and periodicals are also different from before. At present, bookstore distributors often encounter such things: after readers buy books and periodicals and read them, they find something wrong in them, and they take the original book to the bookstore to question why they sell such irresponsible books and periodicals. In newspapers and magazines, the situation of readers submitting letters to criticize books is also increasing day by day. After the trend of mass criticism in the publishing industry is launched, even if publishers do not consider the interests of readers, if they still want to "print black characters on white paper" and print out books and periodicals of very poor quality to fool readers, readers will not accept it.
　　Under the current new situation, some of our publishers may feel at a loss as to what to do. In fact, the road of the publishing industry is very broad. Our country, with a population of 480 million, has always been so backward in cultural level. Once the country's economic construction cause is on track, the climax of cultural construction will inevitably come along with it. The things to be done in the publishing industry will keep our publishing workers busy. Even today, are not the vast readers already eager for the publication of excellent books and periodicals?
　　In the past, our publishers often acted like department stores, encompassing everything and striving for the completeness of the types of goods. Everyone always wanted to win over others in terms of the types of publications. In fact, this is not worth learning from. Instead of having many types but poor quality, it is better to select a certain part of readers as the target, or a certain department of reading materials as the scope, and do it conscientiously, which is easier to do well. Today, the number of readers with different objects is gradually expanding, and publishing work must be well and systematically divided.
　　In the past, China's publishing industry was almost entirely concentrated in Shanghai. This is naturally because Shanghai has many good conditions required by the publishing industry. In the future, the huge number of publications required by the whole country cannot be supplied by Shanghai alone. In order to meet the different needs of people in various regions across the country, each region should have its own publishing center. Books and periodicals with local characteristics are naturally suitable for editing and printing by various localities. As for material conditions such as printing, paper, and ink, there must be ways to solve them.
　　The road of the new Chinese publishing industry is really very broad. The central question is whether our publishers can understand the nature of the people's publishing business. This is the question of ideological transformation of publishers. Vice Chairman Zhu De once said a paragraph on this issue, let me excerpt it below as the end of this article.
　　"The fact that the revolution has won victory throughout the country and the fact that the climax of cultural construction is about to come will constantly put forward many important tasks in front of our publishing workers, requiring everyone to learn from scratch. If a person cannot constantly improve himself ideologically and cannot pursue progress in business every day, he will certainly not be able to do any work well, and of course he will not be able to do publishing work well. Revolutionary publishing workers must always remember that he is responsible to the people and is a political worker and propagandist among the people. Therefore, he must first learn from the masses of the people. Only those who can conscientiously learn from the people can do a good job of educating the people. Revolutionary publishing workers must raise daily business to a political level, improve business with excellence, and improve work efficiency. Therefore, he must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and conscientiously study policies in various aspects, and combine them with his own business." (Speech at the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference)

　　认真做好出版工作
    炎如
    自从去年上海、武汉等城市解放以后，我国出版界逐渐开始全面地活跃起来。上海向来是全国出版业的中心，目前出版家的数量和新出版物的种类，仍以上海占第一位。其次是首都北京和天津，东北的沈阳和大连。此外如华东区的济南，中南区的武汉、广州，都有书刊出版。就新出版物的种类来说，虽然还没有可靠的统计数字，从报纸上的书籍广告和一般书店门市部的情形看来，除了新华书店印行的马列主义文献、毛主席著作和政府文件之外，主要的有苏联介绍、文艺（包括苏联文学翻译）、社会科学小册子等等，其次是新名辞辞典、新连环图画、工农读物、学习手册和学习资料等等。但在市场上流行的书籍，解放以前刊行的还是占多数。就新出版物的质量来说，公营的书店还有若干出版物是草率而不够水平的，私营书店固然也有比较认真地在工作的，但一般说来大都嫌不够认真。很多书籍，不但政治水准很差，连文化水准也不够高。翻译作品译文大都很草率，可信赖的不多。听说某书局为了抢先出版翻译作品，一找得可以翻译的材料，就把原出版物拆散，分交几个人去翻译，在几天之内，就可以把它译好印出来，这样粗制滥造出来的东西，质量自然不会怎么好。此外如翻印文件和编印学习资料，大多很杂乱。而且往往同一篇文字，被选在好几种不同的书名的选本里，这是一种浪费。这种情形，在各地新华书店的出版物中，也常可以看到。从目前整个出版界的情形看来，显然还呈现着无计划、无目的、盲目生产的混乱现象。
    目前我们的出版界为什么还存在着这样的混乱情形呢？我们认为较主要的原因，不外下面两项：首先是我们出版界过去许多年来所形成的旧风气，积重难返，一时还不容易改变过来。只是为了追求利润，漫无计划地进行生产的作风显然是不符合于新时代的要求的。即使在国民党统治时期，有过奋斗历史的进步出版业。在过去也不免沾染了某些不够谨严的作风。到了现在有些出版业者，在主观上未尝不想把工作做好，可是由于对人民出版事业的性质还不能有透彻的了解，在做法上仍还不能把旧的那一套完全抛弃，这就是说，目前出版界的混乱情形，是旧时代出版界的一种残留现象。其次在公营出版业方面，新华书店虽然已经有十年的历史，可是从前在老解放区里是分散在各地区独立作战的，当时的物质条件又是那么艰苦，因此它在政策上、组织上、业务上，都长期或多或少的存在过各自为政的情形。今天它刚刚开始走向全国范围统一的道路，还不能很快地把工作提高一步，同时对全国私营出版业，也还不能起更好的示范和协助的作用。
    “发展人民出版事业”，在共同纲领中有着明确的规定，人民出版事业是定会得到国家的重视和扶植的。然而在出版业方面，却必须先从自身来作种种努力，决不应稍存依赖的心理。从前国民党反动政府，曾经在出版界施行过配给外汇购买纸张的办法，这种办法，表面看来对于出版业是有好处的，但是只要稍稍一想，便可以知道这种好处原来是反动政府向全国人民榨取来的血汗的余沥，以广大的人民利益为前提的人民政府，决不能这样来做。今天我们出版业者，必须认清出版工作是整个革命工作的一部分，也就是整个国家建设工作的一部分，必须配合国家的整个方针、政策认认真真来做，那他的事业才真正是为人民服务的事业。中共中央宣传部陆定一部长在去年全国新华书店出版工作会议闭幕词中说：“为人民服务的出版事业是有前途的……我们的出版事业与旧的出版事业不同之点，就是无条件为人民服务。人民解放事业的利益，对于我们是唯一的利益，无论书店赚钱或赔本，无论个人享受得好或坏，都要为人民服务。人民的出版工作者，在国民党统治下，甚至不惜为了人民的利益而牺牲自己的生命。……新华书店和三联书店是这种出版事业的榜样，全国的优秀的出版工作者都将跟着这条道路前进。”陆部长的话，是对新华书店的工作者说的，这些话，在今天，对于一般出版业者，似乎稍嫌陈义过高，但我们相信在不久以后，出版工作者都会了解这些话的意义而“跟着这条道路前进”的。同时，整个社会环境也在督促出版业者非向前进不可。任何地区，一经解放以后，公私机关团体的各级干部、学校的教师和学生，以至一般市民和工农大众，学习进修已经成了风气，人民大众的政治水准一般地已经显著提高，文化水准也在逐渐增进，读者群对于书刊的质量的要求也和以前不同了。目前书店的发行工作者常常会碰到那样的事情：读者买了书刊回去看过之后，发觉其中有什么错误，就拿着原书向书店去责问，为什么这样不负责任出售这样的书刊。在报纸杂志上，读者投书批评书籍的情形，也在一天天多起来。在出版界的群众批评风气展开以后，出版业者即使不为读者的利益打算，如果还是想在“白纸上印黑字”，拿质量很差的书刊印出去搪塞读者，读者是不会接受的。
    在目前的新情势之下，我们的某些出版业者，也许要兴彷徨莫适之感吧。其实出版业的路广阔得很。我们这样一个拥有四万万八千万人口的国家，向来文化程度又是那样落后，一等到国家经济建设事业走上轨道，文化建设的高潮必然要伴随着到来，在出版业上要做的事情，将会使我们的出版工作者应接不暇的。就是在今天，广大的读者不是已经在渴望优良书刊的出版么？
    过去我们的出版业者，往往像百货商店一样，包罗万象，力求货品种类的齐备，大家总想从出版物的种类上来取胜于人，其实这是并不足为训的。如其种类多而质量不精，毋宁择定某一部分读者为对象，或某一部门读物为范围，认认真真地来做，比较容易做好。今天，各种不同对象的读者，数量都在逐渐扩大，出版工作更非好好地有计划地分工不可。
    过去我国出版业几乎全部集中上海一地，这自然因为上海具备着许多出版业所需的良好条件的缘故。今后全国所需要的庞大数量的出版物决不可能由上海一地来供应。为适应全国各地区人民不同的需要，各地区应各有其出版中心，带地方性的书刊，自然以由各地方编印为适宜。至于印刷、纸张、油墨等等物质条件，一定有办法可以解决的。
    新中国出版业的路真是宽广得很。中心问题还在我们的出版业者是否能够了解人民出版事业的性质。这就是出版业者思想改造的问题。朱德副主席对这问题曾说过一段话，让我节录在下面，作为本文的结束。
    “革命在全国范围内胜利的事实，文化建设高潮即将到来的事实，在我们的出版工作者面前将不断提出许多的重大任务，要求大家从头学习。一个人如果不能在思想上不断提高自己，不能在业务上每天追求进步，他一定是做不好任何工作的，当然也做不好出版工作。革命的出版工作者必须时时刻刻记得他是对人民负责的，是在人民中的政治工作者，宣传工作者，因此他首要向人民大众学习，能够认真向人民学习的人，才能够做好教育人民的工作。革命的出版工作者一定要把日常业务提到政治的高度，精益求精地改进业务，提高工作效率，因此他一定要学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，认真研究各方面的政策，拿来和自己的业务结合起来。”（在全国新华书店出版工作会议上的讲话）
