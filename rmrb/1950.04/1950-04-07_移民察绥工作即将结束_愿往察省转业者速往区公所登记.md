[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] With the spring plowing season approaching, the work of Beijing residents immigrating to Chahar and Suiyuan to engage in agricultural production is coming to an end. The final group of immigrants heading to Suiyuan departed Beijing yesterday (the 6th). In total, ten groups of rickshaw pullers, unemployed impoverished citizens, and intellectuals, amounting to over 4,700 people, have been transferred to Suiyuan. They have been resettled by the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government in seven counties: Fengzhen, Jining, Longsheng, Wudong, Liangcheng, Xinghe, and Taolin. The work of immigration to Chahar Province will also conclude on the 15th of this month. Rickshaw pullers and unemployed city residents wishing to transfer to that province should promptly register at their respective district offices to avoid missing the opportunity.
