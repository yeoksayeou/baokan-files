　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, April 27th: State-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Chahar Province have completed their first quarter production plans as scheduled. Provincial and municipal enterprises, after rational adjustments, have also shown significant improvements in production. The state-owned Datong Coal Mine, a key restoration project in the North China region, exceeded its first quarter coal production target (including small-scale non-mechanized mining) by 2.36%. In terms of engineering construction, the 590,000-ton drainage project for the first quarter was completed one and a half months ahead of schedule. The repair, assembly, and installation of electric pumps, as well as the reinforcement of underground main roadways, were also completed as planned. The first quarter output of the Yantongshan mine at the state-owned Longyan Iron Mine exceeded the original plan by 19.75%. The construction project at the Pangjiabao mine, with the exception of civil engineering work delayed due to frozen ground, was completed as scheduled. Among these, the repair of mine tunnels exceeded the plan by 81.9%, and the construction of light railways exceeded the plan by 100%. In addition, the Chazhong Branch of the State-owned North China Electric Power Bureau (including the Xiahuayuan and Pingwang power plants) also basically completed its power supply plan.

　　The production of provincial and municipal enterprises has also improved in the first quarter. Last year, provincial and municipal enterprises experienced blind production that disregarded costs and sales. Since the beginning of this year, the Chahar Provincial Department of Industry has implemented the policy of "focusing on restoration," either ceasing investment in or reducing the scale of factories producing matches, food, and glassware that have no temporary sales, thus reducing the difficulties of insufficient manpower and capital. In the first quarter, the production volume of five factories under the Chahar Provincial Department of Industry, such as the Zhangjiakou Vegetable Oil Factory and Brewery, exceeded the plan by 4.8% to 13.3%, while costs were reduced by 4.6% to 16.5%.

　　In order to complete and strive to exceed the province's first quarter industrial production plan, the municipal Party committees and municipal trade unions of Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong cities successively formed joint working groups in a planned manner, going deep into factory workshops to work with factory cadres to specifically guide workers in improving production, initially bringing into play the active role of factory Party organizations and trade unions. At the same time, each factory, based on the measures formulated by the Provincial People's Government to reward creations, inventions, technical improvements, and everything conducive to production, promptly commended and rewarded advanced producers, further enhancing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. In Datong Coal Mine alone, workers put forward more than 500 constructive suggestions in the first quarter production. The rationalization proposals and the new record-breaking movement carried out in the factories and mines of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua were also powerful factors in completing the plan.

　　察哈尔国营工业完成首季生产计划
    省市企业生产也显著进步
    【新华社张家口二十七日电】察哈尔国营工、矿企业已如期完成第一季生产计划；合理调整后的省、市营企业，生产也有显著进步。作为华北区煤矿恢复重点的国营大同煤矿，第一季煤产量（包括非机械开采的小窑在内）已超过原计划的百分之二·三六。在工程修建方面，则提前一个半月完成了第一季五十九万吨的排水工程；电泵的修配、按装和强化井下大巷等工程也已如期完成计划。国营龙烟铁矿烟筒山矿场第一季的产量超过了原计划的百分之一九·七五；庞家堡矿场的修建工程，除土木工程因地冻延期动工未完成计划外，其他均已如期完成，其中矿洞的整修超过计划百分之八一·九，轻便铁道的修建超过计划百分之一百。此外国营华北电业局察中支公司（包括下花园和平旺两发电厂）也基本上完成了动力供应的计划。
    第一季生产中，省、市营企业也已好转。去年省、市营企业存在着不顾成本、销路等盲目生产的现象。今年以来，察省工业厅贯彻了“重点恢复”的方针，对于暂时没销路的火柴、食品、料器等工厂，或停止投资，或缩小范围，因而减少了人力、资金不足的困难。第一季中察哈尔省工业厅所属张家口植物油厂、酿造厂等五个工厂的生产量，都超过计划百分之四·八至一三·三，成本则降低了百分之四·六至一六·五。
    为了完成并争取超过全省第一季工业生产计划，张家口、宣化、大同等三市的中国共产党市委和市工会曾有计划地先后组成了联合工作组，深入各厂车间，协同各厂干部具体领导职工搞好生产，初步发挥了工厂党与工会的积极作用。同时各厂又依据省人民政府制订的奖励创造、发明、改进技术及一切有利生产的办法，及时表扬和奖励先进生产者，进一步提高了广大工人群众的积极性。仅大同煤矿，在第一季生产中，工人便提出了五百余条富于建设性的意见。在张家口和宣化两地厂矿中开展的合理化建议与创造新纪录运动，也是完成计划的有力因素。
