Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to TASS reports: Soviet workers are striving to fulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule with outstanding labor achievements.

　　The Kirov Factory in Gorlovka, Ukraine, has already completed its Five-Year Plan.

　　In factories and manufacturing plants in Kharkov, Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Rovno, and other cities in Ukraine, thousands of workers are producing more than two work quotas every day and every shift. Temenkov, a labor hero and well-known coal cutter in the Donets Basin, has overfulfilled the quota for seven months in the first quarter of this year. In the Misovaya Metallurgical Plant, Yevseyev's team produced more than two tons of milling iron per cubic meter of furnace volume in 24 hours, creating an outstanding record.

　　A movement to save raw materials in enterprises has been launched. Sakharov and other steelworkers in Magnitogorsk have initiated a competition to reduce production costs. They decided to save one million rubles in 1950 by strictly saving expenses, fuel, refractory materials, and electricity, and to produce 12,000 tons of steel beyond the annual plan. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Soviet Metallurgical Workers' Union has adopted his proposal and called on local trade unions to launch a competition to save and reduce costs. Kolabelnikova's team, a pioneer in the Moscow shoe industry, has overproduced 2,313 pairs of shoes, of which 1,800 pairs were made from saved raw materials. Kuznitsov's workshop, another pioneer, saved more than 5,000 meters of leather and more than 1,000 meters of textiles in two and a half months.

　　苏联工人正以卓越生产成就
    争取提前完成五年计划
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联工人正以卓越的劳动成就，争取提前完成五年计划。
    乌克兰的高尔罗夫卡城的基洛夫制造厂，已完成了五年计划。
    在乌克兰的哈尔科夫、基辅、德聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、罗夫及其他城市的工厂和制造厂里，数以千计的工人，每天每班都能生产出两个以上的工作定额。顿尼兹盆地的劳动英雄、著名切煤工人特门科夫，在今年第一季中已超计划地生产了七个月份的定额。在米索瓦亚冶金工厂中，埃佛雪耶夫的工作队，在二十四小时内，从每一立方公尺熔炉容积中生产出两吨以上的铣铁，造成了出色的纪录。
    企业中节省原料的运动业已展开。马格尼托哥尔斯克的炼钢工人萨哈罗夫等人，倡议发动减低生产成本的竞赛。他们决定在一九五○年经由最严格地节省费用、燃料、耐火物资和电力等，来节省一百万卢布，并且在本年度计划之外，生产一万二千吨钢。苏联冶金工人工会中央委员会主席团已通过了他的建议，并号召各地方工会展开节约和减低成本的竞赛。莫斯科制鞋工业开路先锋科拉贝尔尼科娃的工作队，业已超计划多生产了二千三百一十三双鞋子，其中，有一千八百双是用节省下来的原料制造的。另一开路先锋库兹尼左夫的工作间，在两个半月内节省了五千余公尺皮料和一千余公尺纺织物。
