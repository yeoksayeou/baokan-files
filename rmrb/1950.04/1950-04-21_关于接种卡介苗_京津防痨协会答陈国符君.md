　　Regarding BCG Vaccination
　　Beijing-Tianjin Anti-Tuberculosis Association Answers Mr. Chen Guofu

Editor:

　　I recently took my child to the Beijing-Tianjin Anti-Tuberculosis Association in Beichizi for BCG vaccination. During the Mantoux test and BCG vaccination, the needles used by the doctor, including the needle tip and shaft, were not sterilized in boiling water. Given that over 150 people are vaccinated daily, will this cause the vaccinated individuals to contract diseases?

Mr. Chen Guofu:

　　Your question has been answered by the outpatient department of the Beijing-Tianjin Anti-Tuberculosis Association as follows:

　　Our department always sterilizes the needles and syringes using high-heat dry sterilization on the day before conducting Mantoux tests or BCG vaccinations. During injections, the skin area where the injection will be administered is first disinfected. Because the needle is inserted "intradermally" (or subcutaneously), the needle tip should not come into contact with bacteria. If an individual has suppurative skin disease, our department will not administer the vaccination. In the case of non-suppurative skin diseases, the needle is replaced after the injection. Therefore, even though we administer injections to 150 to 200 people each time, there is no risk of "introducing bacteria." The tuberculosis department of the First Health Center has been conducting Mantoux tests for over ten years and has not found any cases of patients contracting skin diseases or other suppurative infections. This practice has been used in Eastern European countries, with over 20 million people vaccinated. No cases of infectious diseases have occurred.

　　If the syringes and needles are sterilized by boiling, it is easy for some water to adhere to the needle tube and needle tip, which will affect the concentration of the drug and alter its accuracy. Therefore, boiling sterilization is not as good as high-heat dry sterilization.

　　关于接种卡介苗
    京津防痨协会答陈国符君编辑先生：
    我最近带小孩到北池子京津防痨协会接种卡介苗。在接种试验苗及卡介苗时，医生所用之针，其针头及针杆皆不在沸水中消毒。这样每天接种一百五十余人，是否会使接种者传染了疾病？
            陈国符陈国符先生：
    你的问题由京津防痨协会门诊部答复如下：
    本部每次作结素试验或卡介苗接种工作，在头一天总要把针头及注射器，用高热干燥消毒。注射时，先把受接种者扎针部分皮肤消毒。因为针是扎在“皮内”（皮下亦同），针头无细菌可沾染。如遇有皮肤上有化脓性疾病者，本部即不予接种；如非化脓性皮肤病，注射后即另换针头。故虽每次作一百五十人至二百人的注射工作，也不致“引入细菌”。第一卫生所痨病科作结素试验已十余年，并未发现有传染皮肤病或其他化脓病的病患。在东欧各国如此作法，已注射过二千万人。亦没有传染病患发生。
    注射器及针头，如用煮沸消毒法，针管及针头上容易附着一部水份，将影响到药剂的浓度而改变其准确性。故煮沸消毒一法，不如高热干燥消毒方法好。
