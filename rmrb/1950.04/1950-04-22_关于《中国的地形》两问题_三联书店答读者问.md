To the Editor:

　　In the New China Encyclopedia Small Series published by Sanlian Bookstore, in the section on Taiwan mountains on page 90 of "China's Topography" written by Chen Shijian, it says: "Although Taiwan is an isolated island, the Xingaoshan Mountains on Taiwan are connected to the Himalayas as a system." Taiwan is so far away from the Himalayas, how can Taiwan's Xingaoshan Mountains be connected to the Himalayas as a system? Also, the term "ice age" appears in history textbooks, what exactly is an ice age? How is it formed? How much time does an ice age last approximately?

Mr. Xiao Ziju:

　　Your questions have been answered by the Editorial Department of Sanlian Bookstore as follows:

　　(1) Regarding the question of the Xingaoshan Mountains being connected to the Himalayas as a system, the statement in "China's Topography" is not incorrect. On page 10 of the same book, it is already mentioned that the Himalayas are mountain ranges that rose through the orogenic movement of the Tertiary period, which is proven by their geological structure and the marine biological fossils found at the foot of the mountains. As for the Xingaoshan Mountains, it is also said on page 91 of the same book that they are part of the Tertiary fold belt. The formation of the Xingaoshan Mountains and the formation of the Himalayas occurred in the same period, and in this sense, they are "connected as a system."

　　This "system" is not the mountain range system commonly used in old geography books, so it is irrelevant to "distance."

　　(2) The term "ice age" is the same as "glacial period." In the Earth's formation history, the Cambrian and Carboniferous periods of the Paleozoic Era both had glacial periods. After the quiet Mesozoic Era, glacial discoveries were made again in the Neogene period of the Cenozoic Era, with the Pliocene (or Pliocene series) glaciers being quite dominant. The advance and retreat of glaciers have marked out glacial periods and interglacial periods. The reason for their formation is, of course, the change in the Earth's surface climate. However, the reason why the Earth's surface climate changes is still uncertain. Some say it is related to sunspots; others say it is due to the movement of the Earth's axis, with the frigid zone transferring at times; others say it may be because the angle between the Earth's axis and the ecliptic plane has changed.

　　As for the time elapsed during a glacial period, there is no fixed duration.

　　A "glacial period" is when the Earth's surface is gradually covered by ice and snow, and an "interglacial period" is when the ice and snow gradually disappear.

　　关于《中国的地形》两问题
    ——三联书店答读者问编辑同志：
    三联书店出版的新中国百科小丛书中，陈史坚著的《中国的地形》一书第九十页台湾山地一段里说：“台湾虽然是一个孤立的海岛，但是台湾上的新高山，却是和喜马拉雅山连成一个系统的。”台湾离喜马拉雅山系这样远，怎么台湾的新高山会跟喜马拉雅山连成一个系统的呢？又，历史课本中有“冰期”一词，到底什么叫冰期？怎样形成的？一个冰期约经过多少时间？
            萧子居萧子居君：
    你的问题已由三联书店编审部解答如下：
    （一）关于新高山与喜马拉雅山连成一个系统的问题，《中国的地形》上面的话并没有错误。在同书第十页上已经说到，喜马拉雅山是经过第三纪造山运动的作用隆起来的山脉，这是由它的地质构造和山麓所存海上生物化石证明了的。至于新高山，在同书九十一页上也说是第三纪褶曲带的一部分。新高山的形成与喜马拉雅山的形成是在同一时期，就这意义上说，它们是“连成一个系统的”。
    这个“系统”，不是旧日地理书上习用的山脉系统，所以与“距离远近”是无关的。
    （二）“冰期”一词，即是“冰川期”。在地球形成史上，古生代之寒武纪，石炭纪，均有冰川期。经过了中生代的平静之后，新生代的新第三纪又有冰川发现，上新期（或上新统）冰川颇占优势。冰川的一进一退，画出了冰川期和间冰川期。其形成的原因，当然是地球表面气候的变迁。但地球表面气候何以有变迁，至今尚无定论，有的说与太阳斑点有关；有的说因地轴移动，寒带时有转移；有的说或许是因为地轴与黄道面的角度有变化。
    至于冰川期经过的时间，则并无一定。
    “冰川期”是地球表面逐渐为冰雪掩盖，到“间冰川期”即系冰雪逐渐消失。
