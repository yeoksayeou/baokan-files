　　Cadres of State-Owned Factories and Mines in Xuanhua Go Deep into the Field to Lead Production; Monthly Production Plans Mostly Completed Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Dispatch] Since January, the state-owned factories and mines in Xuanhua City, due to cadres going deep into the field to lead production, have mostly been able to complete and exceed production tasks ahead of schedule. Achievements have also been made in improving quality and saving materials. For example, the Yantongshan mines No. 1 and No. 2 completed their monthly tasks in both January and February. In the first half of March, they exceeded the entire month's production plan by 225.12 tons. At the Dong 30th rock roadway in Pangjiabao, the rock was extremely hard, and the workers' labor intensity had reached its peak. After discovering this, the work team immediately suggested to the administration to increase the power of the yellow explosives. At the same time, the trade union, the Party, and the administration, in coordination with the work team and technicians, researched and improved the blasting techniques in this roadway. As a result, production efficiency increased rapidly. On the 14th of last month, the blasting depth increased from 1.5 feet to 2 feet, and the daily tunneling rate also increased to 55 centimeters, with a maximum of 1 meter, more than double the previous rate. The paper mill accepted the suggestion of worker Ding Junxin to reduce the caustic soda from 10% to 8%, making the paper surface whiter and saving 500 catties of caustic soda per month, equivalent to more than 2,500 catties of rice. Secondly, the workers' awareness has been raised, and they have established a sense of ownership. For example, Guan Yi, the acting group leader of the seventh mining group in Pangjiabao, because of the backward production performance in February, voluntarily went to the trade union to ask for a "black flag" (a symbol of backward work) and said to the trade union director, "Watch me replace it with a red flag in March." Sure enough, in March, he not only got the red flag but also completed the task ahead of schedule.

　　宣化国营厂矿干部深入现场领导生产
    逐月生产计划大部提早完成
    【本报讯】宣化市各国营厂矿自一月份以来，由于干部深入现场领导生产，大部均能提前完成并超过生产任务，在提高质量和节省材料上，也获得成绩。如烟筒山一、二月份每月均已完成任务，三月上半月即超过完成全月生产计划二二五·一二吨。庞家堡的东三十号石巷石头最硬，且工人劳动强度已达顶点，工作组发觉后，立即向行政上建议，增加了爆炸效力较大的黄色火药。同时工会、党、政配合工作组及技工等，研究改进了该巷打炮技术，因此生产效率迅速提高。上月十四日打炮深度由一尺五寸增至二尺，每日掘进率也提高到五十五公分，最高可达一米，比过去增加一倍。造纸厂接受工人丁俊信意见，将火碱由百分之十减到百分之八，纸面较前净白，且每月可省火碱五百斤，合米二千五百多斤。其次是工人觉悟提高，树立了主人翁的思想。如庞家堡采矿第七组代班小组长关义因二月份生产成绩落后，自动到工会去要“黑旗”（工作落后的标帜），并对工会主任说：“看三月份我一定要换上红旗”，果然三月份不但得了红旗，而且提前完成任务。
