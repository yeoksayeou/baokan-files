Illegible Public Service Announcement Captions
    Hope local cultural and educational authorities notify theaters to revise them!

    To the Editor:
　　Nowadays, before each movie starts, theaters invariably show several public service announcements from the government and organizations, such as propaganda from the Public Bonds Sales Committee, fire prevention propaganda, and announcements about the use of the "09" telephone number. Some movie theaters project these announcements with very illegible and distorted characters. I believe this is not right. I hope theater staff will pay attention to correcting this, and write the fonts on the master copies more neatly and clearly. This is not a difficult thing to do, but it can increase the audience's interest and enhance the effectiveness of the propaganda. The matter is small, but the benefits are great.

    Mr. Jing Yu:
　　Your suggestion is answered by the Distribution Department of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture as follows:
　　Currently, the management of movie theaters and the text of relevant educational slides are the responsibility of the local cultural and educational authorities. As for illegible handwriting on the slides, the theaters should be responsible for correcting or changing them. In addition to our notifying the film management companies to relay this to the theaters for attention, we hope that the local cultural and educational authorities will also notify the theaters to pay attention.

　　公告字幕潦草
    希望当地文教机关通知影院修改！编者先生：
    现在每家影院在开演之先，必有政府、团体的几件公告，例如：推销公债委员会的宣传，防火宣传，零九电话用途的公告等。有某些电影院镜头映出的字很潦草歪拗，我认为这是不对的。希望影院工作同志加以注意改正，把底版的字体写得端正清楚一些。这并不是一件什么难做的事，但可以提高观众的兴趣，增加了宣传的效力。事情虽小，收益却大。
                                            景禹景禹君：
    你的建议，由文化部电影局发行处答复如下：
    目前影院管理及有关宣传教育之幻灯片文字由当地之文教机关负责。至于片上字迹潦草，影院应负责修正或更改。此事除由我们通知影片经理公司转告各影院加以注意外，希当地文教主管机关通知各影院注意。
                                            编者
