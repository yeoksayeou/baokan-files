Allocating Houses without Land Foundations: Farmers Forced to Demolish and Rebuild
Wang Anguo County Government Inspects and Stops

To the Editor:

　　On April 7th, I went to Zhangxiang Village, Fifth District, Anguo County, Hebei Province. This area has undergone land reform, and the original property rights of landlords' houses have been determined to belong to the peasants. However, for some reason, the land foundations still belong to the landlords. I saw farmers demolishing perfectly good brick houses, transporting the wood and bricks back home to rebuild their own houses. As far as I know, the following have already been demolished: three brick houses belonging to the former Han Zongqin family in West Han Family Street, and several other sheds. More than ten brick houses are preparing to be demolished. I believe this is extremely unreasonable. Destroying the houses and then rebuilding them wastes a lot of manpower and materials.

　　Furthermore, instead of using reasonable methods to distribute the landlords' vacant lots to the peasants, village cadres are selling them to the peasants. There are many such cases in West Han Family Street, Zhangxiang Village.

　　Editor's Note: The issue raised by Comrade Han Yunduo is very important. This phenomenon of demolishing houses should be effectively stopped. We hope that the Anguo County People's Government will investigate and correct this situation, and inform us of the truth of the matter and the handling process.

### 分配房屋不连地基  农民只得拆屋重建  望安国县政府检查制止

　　分配房屋不连地基  农民只得拆屋重建
    望安国县政府检查制止编者同志：
    四月七日我到冀中安国县五区张乡村去。这地方已进行了土地改革，地主原有的房产权，已确定属于农民所有；但是，不知怎样的，地基仍归地主所有。我看见农民正把很好的砖房拆毁，将木料、砖瓦等运回家中从新盖房子。据我所知：已经拆毁的有西韩家街原韩宗琴砖房三间，和别的棚子数间，尚有十余间砖房正准备拆毁。我认为这是极不合理的，破坏了房子再从新盖起来，要浪费很多的人力物力。
    还有地主之空场，村干部不用合理办法分给农民，却采用买卖方法卖给农民。类此事情张乡村西韩家街很多。

    编者按：韩韵铎同志提出的问题，是很重要的，这种拆毁房屋的现象，应该加以有效的制止。希望安国县人民政府检查，纠正这种情形，并把事情的真相和处理经过告诉我们。
