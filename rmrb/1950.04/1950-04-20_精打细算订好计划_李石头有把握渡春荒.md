To the Editor:

I am reporting to you on farmer Li Shitou's situation regarding production and overcoming the famine.

Li Shitou is a farmers' association member from Xiaocun Village, Sixth District, Yanshi County, Henan. He is forty-seven years old this year, and his family consists of five people – his wife, Changhai, Nizi, Chunhai, and himself. Last winter, he planted three mu of wheat, two mu and four fen of broad beans, and left nine fen of sweet potato land unplanted. Last autumn, because of insect pests and continuous rain during the hottest part of the summer, the two mu of millet yielded only one "chun" (five dou), and he also harvested one cart of sweet potatoes. All in all, it was only enough to barely last until the Tomb Sweeping Festival on the second day of the second lunar month. He realized the severity of the current spring famine, and he thought day and night about how to overcome it:

(1) Usually, eat more wild vegetables mixed with porridge, making one month's food rations last for one and a half months.

(2) Every other evening, go to the Donghe coal mine to "jiao ba" (Note 1) once, earning two sheng of millet. Counting ten times a month, he can "jiao" about twenty times in one spring, earning four dou of millet, which at two sheng per day, can feed five people for about ten days.

(3) Changhai and Nizi, both teenagers this year, can cut thirty jin of grass a day, exchanging it for one sheng of millet. Calculating thirty times of cutting in one spring, they can earn one and a half dou of millet, which can also last for ten days.

(4) Although his wife still has a young child clinging to her leg, she can still spin three liang of thread every day, getting up early and going to bed late. In two months, she can spin ten jin, and one jin can earn one and a half sheng of rice, which can support eight days of living.

(5) He will do three days of odd jobs at Wang Cheng's house within ten days, and in addition to food, he can also earn one sheng of rice. He can do twenty odd jobs in one spring, and the remuneration can maintain four days of living.

(6) He and his neighbor Li Changlin jointly go to the mountains to pull "lei shi" (Note 2). Calculating twelve or thirteen trips in one spring, he can divide four and a half dou of beans, enough to eat for twenty-four days.

Li Shitou calculates that from the second day of the second lunar month to the wheat harvest, there are fifty days. In addition to the spring expenses, he can still have eighteen days of food rations left over. I think his method of carefully planning and overcoming the disaster is worth introducing.

Note: (1) "Jiao ba" - using manpower to wind coal at the coal mine is called "jiao ba." (2) "Lei shi" - stones from the mountain that are not artificially manufactured and are pulled back for use are called "lei shi."

### 精打细算订好计划  李石头有把握渡春荒

　　精打细算订好计划  李石头有把握渡春荒编辑同志：
    我向你们报告农民李石头生产渡荒的情形。
    李石头是河南偃师县六区销村的一个农会会员，今年四十七岁了，全家共五口人——老婆、长海、妮子、春海和他自己。去年冬季他种了三亩麦子，二亩四分扁豆，还丢着九分红薯地。去年秋季因为遭了虫灾，伏里天正热时，雨水又不老跟趁，所以二亩谷子只打了一椿（五斗），又出了一车红薯，总共算起来，仅可将就到二月二本村扫墓大会，就一粒米也不会剩了。他看到今天春荒的严重，他就日夜盘算渡过春荒的办法：
    （一）平时多用野菜混粥吃，一月口粮吃一个半月。
    （二）隔一天晚上到东河煤窑上搅把（注一）一次，可挣二升小米，一月按十次算，一春能搅二十来次，挣四斗小米，一天按二升算，五口人可吃十来天。
    （三）长海和妮子两个孩子，今年都十几岁了，一天可以割三十斤草，换一升小米，一春计算割三十来次，能赚斗半小米，也可将就过十天。
    （四）老婆虽还有一个小孩缠着腿，每天早起晚睡，还能纺三两线。两个月可纺十斤，一斤能赚升半米，这样也可支持八天的生活。
    （五）他十天内要到王成家做三天零工，除吃还可落下一升米，一春能做二十个零工，所得酬劳能维持四天的生活。
    （六）他和邻居李长林家合伙上山拉累石（注二），一春计算拉十二三次，自己可分四斗半豆子，能吃二十四天。
    李石头从二月二算起，到麦熟有五十天的光景，除一春费用以外，还可余剩十八天的口粮。我觉得他这种精打细算，订好计划渡灾荒的办法是值得介绍的。

    注：（一）搅把——煤窑上用人力拐煤叫搅把。（二）累石——山上的石头不经人工制造，拉回用的叫累石。
