Strive to Complete a 10% Increase in Production
Beijing Issues Agricultural Loans to Suburban Areas

The loans are divided into six categories: fertilizer, seeds, farm implements, livestock, well-drilling, and sideline occupations, totaling 4.5 million catties of millet.

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to strive to complete this year's plan to increase agricultural production in the suburbs by 10%, and to assist farmers in solving the difficulties of lacking means of production, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has started agricultural loan work since the beginning of March. This work is jointly carried out by the Municipal Government's Suburban Committee, the Municipal People's Bank, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the district governments of various suburbs. The total amount of loans is equivalent to 4.5 million catties of millet, and the loans are divided into six categories: fertilizer, seeds, farm implements, livestock, well-drilling, and sideline occupations. Loans are granted according to the urgency of needs, the magnitude of difficulties, and through democratic evaluation methods. Fertilizer, seeds, and farm implements are mainly distributed through suburban cooperatives; well-drilling, livestock, and sideline occupations are handled by the bank's suburban offices. The loan for early-maturing crops such as spring wheat and lentils in the seed loan was completed on March 5. Improved seeds include 2,900 catties of corn, 250 catties of peas, and 7,000 catties of millet. After the farmers sow the seeds, personnel from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute will be dispatched to assist in the inspection in order to promote improved varieties. The sideline occupation loan totals 200,000 catties of millet, limited to the conversion of iron-wheeled carts into "rubber-tired carts". The repayment period for loans is one month after the harvest season, except for livestock loans, which have a term of two years, and well loans, which have a term of three years. The interest rate is one percent per month. In the process of carrying out loans for early-maturing crops, fertilizers, and sideline occupations, some deviations were discovered, mainly the average distribution and failure to lend according to actual needs. For example, the early-maturing crop loan in Shangyuan Administrative Village, District 16, was an average of 75 catties of millet per natural village. Furthermore, four households in Zhenguosi, District 14, and twelve households in Kandancun, District 15, did not actually need loans, resulting in a total loan of 678 catties of millet. In addition, individual farmers, after receiving loans, feasted and drank lavishly instead of using the funds for production. The reasons for these deviations are, on the one hand, that some cadres' work is not thorough enough and their understanding of helping farmers solve production difficulties is insufficient, and on the other hand, that some farmers only care about immediate interests and ignore long-term interests. In response to these deviations, the Municipal Government's Suburban Committee has recently instructed all districts to quickly correct them, ensuring that loans are effectively used to develop agricultural production. At the same time, it has also organized inspection teams with the Municipal Bank and the Municipal Cooperative to inspect various districts.

　　争取完成增产一成
    京发放郊区农贷
    贷款分肥料、种籽、农具、牲畜、打井和副业六种，共合小米四百五十万斤。                                     
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为了争取完成今年郊区农业增产一成的计划，协助农民解决缺乏生产资料的困难，已自三月初开始进行农业贷款工作。此项工作由市府郊委会、市人民银行、市供销合作总社、及各郊区区政府共同进行。贷款总数共合小米四百五十万斤，贷款分肥料、种籽、农具、牲畜、打井和副业六种。按需要缓急、困难大小、用民主评议方法分别贷给。肥料、种籽、农具主要是通过郊区合作社进行；打井、牲畜和副业则由银行郊区办事处办理。种籽贷款中的早熟作物春麦、扁豆等已于三月五日贷放完毕。优良种籽计有玉米二千九百斤、菀豆二百五十斤、粟七千斤。农民下种后由华北农业科学研究所派员协助检查，以便推广优良品种。副业贷款共折小米二十万斤，限于改造铁轮车成“翻瓦胶轮”用。贷款归还期限以收获季节后一个月为准，只牲畜贷款期限二年，水井贷款期限三年。利率为月息一分。在进行早熟作物、肥料及副业贷款过程中曾发现一些偏向，主要是平均分配和没有按实际需要贷给。如十六区上圆行政村的早熟作物贷款，平均每自然村都是七十五斤小米，又如十四区镇国寺四户，十五区看丹村等十二户实际并不需要贷款，结果共贷给了六百七十八斤小米。此外，还有个别农民得到贷款后，大吃大喝，不用于生产。发生这些偏向的原因，一方面由于部分干部工作不深入及对帮助农民解决生产困难的工作认识不够，一方面是由于部分农民只顾目前利益，忽视长远利益。市府郊委会针对这些偏向已于日前指示各区迅速纠正，务使贷款切实用于发展农业生产；同时并已与市银行和市合作总社等组织检查小组到各区检查。
