　　A Farmer's Family in a Disaster Area
    ——A Record of Ren Yanling's Family Overcoming Famine Through Labor
    By Our Correspondent Li Wen
  I
    This is an ordinary farmer's family living in New China, and they were my landlords when I was reporting from the disaster area. The male head of the household is Ren Yanling, a simple farmer and a member of the village's Communist Party branch committee. His wife, Yu Ruiqing, is a very hardworking and capable farm woman. There is his mother, who is over sixty years old, and four children. The oldest child is called Xiao Fu, who is thirteen years old; the youngest is five years old, and they call her "Bai Chi Bao" (free loader), because everyone in the family except her is working.
    As soon as it was light, the straw bag machine started up, Yu Ruiqing was weaving, and Yanling was making straw ropes. The old lady made the meal, and they ate around seven o'clock. As soon as the bowls were put down, new activities began. Yanling went to the farm to do odd jobs, Xiao Fu led the livestock to the mutual aid team to sow the land, the two older daughters went to the fields to gather firewood, and the old lady turned the small mill to grind sorghum. The straw bag machine continued to hum, its "zhada zhada" sound continuing from dawn until dark.
    The Yanling family worked hard all winter, taking care of the food and drink for seven people. When the spring plowing began, they still had no stored grain. Yanling wanted to hurry up and cultivate the land, but he didn't dare delay doing odd jobs. He went to Ren Dehou to discuss planting together. Dehou's family had labor but no livestock, so they volunteered to help each other. Xiao Fu led the livestock to exchange labor for planting. Seven mu of spring wheat and twelve mu of sorghum were planted on time. Yanling was still able to do odd jobs as usual, and Ruiqing wove straw bags. In the month after the spring plowing, the farm work was not delayed, and they earned more than 240 catties of rice. - This is the result of the family's hard work.
  II
    Last year, the wheat harvest was connected to the unharvested autumn crops. In June of the lunar calendar, there was a major flood. How did the Ren Yanling family survive the long eight months? In Yanling's words: "To get through the disaster, we had to thank the government for caring for the disaster victims and supporting production; we had to thank the whole family for keeping our hands busy."
    Last spring, the state-owned farm's wasteland called on the masses to reclaim the land, and whoever planted it would harvest it without any burden. The Yanling family was "driven crazy" and rushed to plant more than fifty mu. When the sorghum seedlings came out, they were killed by several hot winds; the second time they rushed to plant, the seedlings came out again, and the whole family put their heart and soul into it. Yanling, Ruiqing, and Xiao Fu desperately weeded, and they were reluctant to go home for a midday rest. The old lady led the two little granddaughters and was busy delivering meals twice a day. After more than twenty days of busy work, the sorghum had been weeded twice, and the heavy rain began. One heavy rain, two heavy rains, the water could not be drained, and the water soaked the sorghum leaves and turned them yellow. After three heavy rains, Yanling said to his mother, "All the hard work of the spring is over." The heavy rain continued for more than ten days, and the flood surrounded Ren Qianhu.
    When the flood came, the Yanling family was really sad for a few days. Yanling frowned and didn't want to do any work, and he didn't feel like doing any work in the village. The village branch held a meeting, and the branch secretary criticized him and comforted him. When Yanling returned home, the family talked about their thoughts. Yu Ruiqing was a strong-willed person, and she said, "Worrying alone won't help us get through the days. If we fall, we will get up again. As long as we work hard, we won't starve to death." The emotional fluctuations were quickly overcome, and the whole family fought the flood tensely again.
    Xiao Fu and the two younger sisters went to the farm to pick up white seeds, Yanling collected firewood, and Ruiqing knew how to weave reeds and partnered with others to weave reeds to catch fish. Every day, the family could pick up one hundred and several tens of catties of firewood. At three o'clock in the morning, Yanling groped along the Da Nian to the city to sell firewood. He arrived in the city at dawn and returned home only at noon, and he couldn't delay picking up firewood in the afternoon. He exchanged a few liters of bran from the city and mixed it with white seeds and sorghum porridge, which was the family's entire food every day. The five-year-old girl didn't understand and couldn't eat the bran steamed bun with her small mouth, and she cried and called for her mother - that scene was really a bit difficult! But the whole family gritted their teeth and persevered. They all agreed: "No matter how difficult it is, we can't sell the donkey. Without it, how can we cultivate the land in the spring?"
    In October, there was a heavy snow, and no firewood could be picked up. Yanling took a straw bag machine and learned to weave it himself. Ruiqing rubbed straw ropes on one side and learned to weave on the other. At first, she could only weave one to one and a half a day. Half a month later, she could weave three a day (now she weaves five a day). In order to free up the whole time for his daughter-in-law to weave straw bags, the mother-in-law did all the work of boiling water and cooking, and she also turned the small mill to grind sorghum. She said to her daughter-in-law: "If I turn the mill one more time, you can have more time to weave straw bags." The daughter-in-law often helped her mother-in-law turn the small mill in the evening. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law discussed things together.
    Yanling is a village cadre, and there is some work in the village that he needs to do. Sometimes he leads the team to transport goods, and sometimes he sets off to buy rice straw from afar for the masses who weave bags. Ruiqing wove one hundred and sixty or seventy straw bags throughout the winter, earning more than three hundred catties of sorghum, which allowed the whole family to get through the harsh winter months.

    The happiest and most lively time for the Yanling family is at dinner time. Yanling returns from the farm, Xiao Fu returns from the field, the two girls return with firewood, Ruiqing gets off the straw bag machine, helps her mother-in-law set up the meal, and the seven people sit around a small square table, talking and laughing happily. At this time, I often join in the fun with them. They don't treat me as an outsider, and everyone talks and laughs.
    Once I said, "Sister-in-law, you and Yanling are both good workers, and you have these good children. When the children grow up, what are you going to let them do?"
    So Yu Ruiqing shared her heartfelt thoughts:
    Xiao Fu's left hand has a problem, but our Xiao Huan (the older girl) is not stupid; I heard that the farm has tractors, and there are women driving them, too. When she grows up, I'll let her learn to drive a tractor. Next year, the disaster will be easier, and we have to send these children to school no matter what. It's really impossible to be illiterate in the future, comrade! We will use machines to grow crops in the future. The farm uses tractors to reclaim land, plowing dozens or hundreds of mu in a while, which is both deep and saves effort. When the south wind blows, we can hear the tractors of the farm "dudu" calling. They also plow the land at night, and we can see the electric lights shining brightly from afar. The farmers can't sleep because they are "scenery" in their hearts, hoping that their land will be able to use machines someday!
    At first, the village cadres said that the farm used machines to cultivate the land, but the people in the village didn't believe it until they really saw it. Before the year, the farm wanted to use tractors to help our village open up land. People near the farm have enlightened ideas very quickly, and the people are very energetic. Some people say: "Don't look at our village as alkaline land, it will become a paddy field in a few years." Many people are also looking forward to it: "The village will have electric lights soon!" Some people say it will be in the autumn of this year, and others guess it will be almost the same next year. It's so convenient to have electric lights, and you can weave three more straw bags in one night, which is six more catties of rice.
    In the past, I never dreamed that farmers would have such a bright future. Why don't we become more and more energetic!

　　灾区一农家
    ——记任延龄全家劳动战胜灾荒
    本报记者  力文
  一
    这是个生活在新中国的普通农家，是我在灾区采访时的一家房东。男主人叫任延龄，是朴实的农民，中共村支部委员。老婆于瑞青是个很勤劳有能耐的农妇。有六十多岁的母亲，还有四个孩子。最大的孩子叫小福，十三岁了；最小的五岁，他们叫她“白吃饱”，因为除她之外，全家无一闲人了。
    天刚亮，草袋机响起来了，于瑞青织着，延龄打草绳。老大娘做好了饭，七点左右便开饭了。饭碗一放，新的活动又开始了。延龄下农场做小工，小福牵着牲口找互助组去耩地，两个大女儿下地拾柴，老大娘拐小磨碾高粱。草袋机照常的响着，轧答轧答的声音，从天明一直响到天黑。
    延龄全家紧忙了一冬，顾住七口人吃喝，春耕开始了，仍无积粮，延龄想赶快耕种地，又不敢耽搁做小工，便去找任德厚商量插伙种地，德厚家有劳力没有牲口，就自愿的互助起来了。小福牵着牲口去换工种地，七亩春麦，十二亩高粱按时种上了，延龄仍能照常做小工，瑞青织草袋机，开春后的一个月，农活没误，还挣米二百四十多斤。——这是全家勤劳的成果。
  二
    去年麦秋连着未收，旧历六月间又发了大水，八个月的漫长日子，任延龄家是怎样熬过的呢？用延龄的话来说：“渡过灾荒，多亏政府关心灾民，扶助生产；多亏一家人两手不闲。”
    去春，国营农场的荒地，号召群众开荒，谁种谁收，不出负担。延龄一家“忙疯了”，抢种了五十多亩。高粱苗出来了，被几场热风刮死了；二次抢种，小苗又出来了，一家人的心劲都用在这上面。延龄、瑞青、小福拚命锄草，晌午都舍不得回家歇晌。老大娘领着两个小孙女，一天忙着送两次饭。接连忙了二十多天，高粱锄过二遍，涝雨下开头了。一场涝雨、二次涝雨，水泄不出去了，水泡得高粱叶发黄。三场涝雨，延龄向妈说：“一春心血完了。”涝雨连下十几天，大水围住了任千户。
    大水发来，延龄一家人着实伤心了几天，延龄绉着眉头，啥活不愿干，村中工作也没心做了。村支部开会，支部书记批评他，又安慰他。延龄回到家里，一家人谈心思，于瑞青是个刚性人，她说：“光发愁，也不顶过日子，摔倒再爬起来，只要辛勤劳动，就饿不死人。”情绪上的波动很快的克服了，全家又紧张的向水灾搏斗了。
    小福和两个妹妹到农场掠白籽，延龄捞柴草，瑞青会织箔，和别人合伙织箔治鱼。每天一家人能拾一百几十斤柴草，三更天延龄沿着大埝摸黑到城里卖柴，天大明赶到城里，往返六十里地折回家只是晌午天，还耽搁不了后半晌拾柴。从城里换回几升麸糠，掺上白籽、高粱稠，便是每天的全部食粮。五岁的小女孩不懂事，合着小嘴吃不下糠馍馍，哭着喊妈，——那光景，实在有些不好过啊！但全家咬着牙熬，他们一致认为：“再困难也不能卖毛驴，没有它，春天怎么种地呢？”
    十月下了一场大雪，柴草拾不到了。延龄领了架草袋机，自己先学会织了，瑞青一面搓草绳，一面学织。开始她每天只能织一个到个半，半个月后，每天能织成三个了（现在每天织五个）。婆婆为着腾出整工夫让媳妇织草袋，烧水做饭都是她一人做，还拐小磨碾高粱。她向媳妇说：“我多拐一次磨，你可多一会工夫织草袋。”媳妇在晚上也常常帮着婆婆拐小磨。有次草袋机出毛病了，瑞青放下机子，便去接正拐着的小磨，她对婆婆说：“你老人家歇歇吧，我拐的快。”婆婆舍不得闲着，又去搓粗草绳。婆媳间有事都是商量着做。
    延龄是村干部，村中有些工作需要他去做。有时领着大伙跑运输，有时出发为织袋的群众到远处去买稻草。瑞青一个人一冬天织了一百六七十个草袋。挣三百多斤高粱，全家得以渡过严冬腊月。
  三
    延龄一家最快活和最热闹的时候，是在吃晚饭。延龄从农场回来，小福从地里回来，两个女孩拾柴回来，瑞青下了草袋机，帮着婆婆把饭摊子摆好，七口人团团的围着一个小方桌，喜笑颜开地说着话。这时，我常常和他们凑热闹，他们不把我当外人，大家有说有笑。
    有一次我说：“大嫂子，你和延龄都是好劳动，又有这几个好儿女，孩子们长大，打算让他们干啥啊？”
    于是引起于瑞青一席心里话：
    小福的左手有毛病，俺小环（大女孩）可不笨；听说农场开拖拉机，还有妇女哩，长大叫她学开拖拉机。来年灾荒轻松点，怎么着也得供这些小孩上学。往前不识字可真不行，同志！咱们以后种庄稼都用机器啊。农场用拖拉机开荒，一会儿犁几十亩，几百亩，又深又省工夫。一刮南风，俺们就听得见农场拖拉机嘟嘟的叫。晚上还犁地，远远望见电灯照眼明，庄稼人心里“景”得睡不着，盼着自己的地，什么时候能使用机器啊！
    开初，村干部说农场用机器种地，庄上老百姓都不信后来真看见了。年前，农场要用拖拉机帮助俺村开地呢。靠近农场的人，思想开通得挺快，老百姓的劲可大啦。有人说：“别看咱村是碱地，不几年就变成水稻田。”还有不少人盼望着：“村上快按电灯吧！”有的说就在今年秋里，有人猜想明年就差不多了。按上电灯够多方便，一晚上还能织三个草袋，就多进六斤米。
    过去做梦也想不到，庄稼人会有这样远大前景，咱为啥不越过越有劲呢！
