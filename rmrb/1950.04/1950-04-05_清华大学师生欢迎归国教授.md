　　Tsinghua University Faculty and Students Welcome Returning Professors
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Tsinghua University Educational Workers' Union and the Student Union held a grand meeting on the 1st to welcome six professors who had recently returned from abroad: Hua Luogeng (Mathematics Department), Zhou Buyi (Construction Engineering Department), Ge Tingsui (Physics Department), Wang Shaofang (Political Science Department), Cheng Minde (Mathematics Department), and Wu Chi (Chemical Engineering Department, who was still en route at the time). The five professors present successively addressed the meeting, unanimously expressing their joy and excitement for the bright future of the motherland and their determination to dedicate their full efforts to the culture and science of the motherland. They also resolved to continuously study to improve their ideological and political levels. Based on their personal experiences, they described the reactionary and decadent situation of the American ruling class. Professor Zhou Buyi said: "The failure of the Kuomintang reactionaries is a prime example of the failure of American imperialism, because they are equally corrupt. When the American monopoly capitalists learned that the Soviet Union had the atomic bomb, they panicked and blamed each other. Those who had been very arrogant before said: 'I in ready to go (meaning 'I can only prepare to die').'" Professor Hua Luogeng said: "Everything in the United States belongs to the capitalists. Other classes, including scientists, are merely hired people. When Einstein warned against the American imperialists' war preparations, the newspapers fiercely criticized him, saying: 'Einstein has made no contribution to atomic energy and should have been expelled long ago.' This is the American imperialists' attitude toward scientists."

　　清华大学师生欢迎归国教授
    【本报讯】清华大学教育工作者工会、学生会于一日晚盛会欢迎新自国外归来的华罗庚（数学系）、周卜颐（营建系）、葛庭燧（物理系）、王绍仿（政治系）、程民德（数学系）、武迟（化工系，当时尚在途中）等六位教授。五位教授在会上相继致词，一致表示为祖国的光明前途而欢欣鼓舞，决心要为祖国的文化科学献出全力，并要不断地学习，来提高自己的思想和政治水平。他们并以亲身的经历，叙述了美国统治阶级反动腐化的情形。周卜颐教授说：“国民党反动派的失败，正是美帝失败的榜样，因为他们正是一样的腐败。当美国垄断资本家们知道了苏联有原子弹时，他们慌张失措，互相埋怨，以前很神气的家伙说：“I in ready to go（意思是‘我只好准备死’）。”华罗庚教授说：“美国的一切是资本家的，其他各阶层，包括科学家，只是雇用的人而已。爱因斯坦警告美帝的备战，报纸就大骂：‘爱因斯坦对原子能并无贡献，早就应该驱逐出境’。这就是美帝对科学家的态度。”
