　　Menchengl Two Coal Mines' Improved Safety and Sanitation Plan
    Beijing Municipal Government Officially Approved and Implemented

    [Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has formally approved the improvement plan for safety and sanitation facilities in the Mentougou and Chengzicun coal mines in western Beijing, drafted by the Labor Bureau. It also instructed the Labor Bureau to implement the plan in order of importance and urgency, and to dispatch personnel for inspection at any time. The main points of the plan are as follows:

    1.  The gunpowder manufacturing site in Mentougou Mine is only a little over one zhang (about 3.3 meters) away from the workers' dormitories, which can easily cause danger (there have been several explosions in the past). It should be moved to a safe area more than 300 meters away; at the very least, it should be moved to the gunpowder depot on the mountain. In Chengzicun Mine, there are two households within the restricted area near the gunpowder warehouse, which should be moved immediately.

    2.  The underground wires in both mines are all weather-proof wires (two layers of cotton thread and one layer of creosote). Because the mines are damp, almost all of them leak electricity, and the voltage is also too high (440 volts), which can easily cause danger (a worker was electrocuted to death last December). The wires should be replaced with rubber-insulated wires immediately, and lamp holders, switches, and fuse boxes should be installed, and the voltage should be reduced to 110 volts.

    3.  The ventilation equipment in Chengzicun Mine is still not good. Especially after blasting in the upper area (i.e., the working area is higher than the ordinary roadway), people can easily be suffocated due to poor air circulation. Air doors and air bridges should be set up to manage the direction of the wind, and the air compressor should be strengthened to send air to ensure smooth air circulation. In addition, the mine plans to install two 50-horsepower electric fans underground, which should be installed before May, because the air in the mine will be even more difficult to circulate after the weather gets hot.

    4.  The trade unions and administrative departments of both mines should strengthen education for workers, strictly prohibit workers from stealing coal pillars, and must use wooden tamping bars. The use of iron ones is no longer allowed, and any injuries should be reported to the trade union immediately. In the past, due to the irresponsibility of workers handing over shifts, workers taking over shifts were crushed to death or electrocuted. From now on, a shift handover system and a clear system of layered responsibility should be established.

    5.  Mentougou Mine should improve medical equipment, and improve medical technology. Under the existing economic conditions, surgical equipment (including instruments, X-rays, operating rooms, etc.) can be expanded first, and one additional surgeon and three nurses can be hired, and beds can be added (at a standard of one bed per 300 people) to take care of Chengzicun and other mines. Strengthen health education and sanitation and prevention work among workers. The two mines should regularly launch sanitation movements such as epidemic prevention and physical examinations.

    6.  Workers in both mines mostly drink water pumped from underground, which contains sulfate. From January to October last year, as many as 2,931 workers in both mines suffered from gastrointestinal diseases. In the future, efforts should be made to draw spring water from the mountains or water from the Yongding River to build tap water for the use of the entire area. The specific plan will be decided by the water company after investigating the water source, water volume, population of the mining area and its development prospects.

    7.  The workers' bathhouse in Mentougou Mine is very unsanitary and easily spreads diseases. It is best to change it to a shower or set up an isolation pool; before another one is built, people with infectious diseases should be prohibited from entering the pool.

    8.  The public canteen in Mentougou is not suitable for the workers' needs, and only a small number of workers are enrolled in it. Most workers cook their own meals and make fires in the dormitories, which is extremely detrimental to their health. The factory should take care of the public canteen and reduce the price of dishes and meals.

    9.  Other issues, such as all the machines in Chengzicun Mine and some of the machines in Mentougou Mine not having belt guards and gear guards, which can easily cause danger; incomplete or unsuitable work clothes for workers; some foundry workers not having aprons and shoe covers, and the raincoats of the workers watching the submersible pumps leaking water underground; many wooden boards near the coal washing machine in Mentougou Mine being damaged, and the vertical shaft of the coal washing machine not having shielding, which can easily injure workers, etc., should all be supplemented and installed immediately. In addition, the workers' dormitories in both mines are extremely unsanitary, with clothes and shoes from the underground and bowls and chopsticks for cooking placed together, and there are no changing rooms and places to store clothes for the underground, etc., which must also be gradually improved.

### 门城两煤矿改进安全卫生方案  京市府正式批准实施

　　门城两煤矿改进安全卫生方案
    京市府正式批准实施
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府顷正式批准劳动局所拟订的关于京西门头沟、城子村两煤矿安全卫生设施的改进方案，并指示劳动局斟酌轻重缓急，分别实施，随时派员进行检查；该方案要点如下：
    一、门头沟矿制火药的地方离工人宿舍只有一丈多远，很容易发生危险（过去就曾爆炸几次），应该迁移到三百米以外的安全地带；起码也得迁到山上的药堡中去。城子村矿保存火药库房附近的警戒线内有两家住户，应立即搬走。
    二、两矿井下电线都是风雨线（两层棉线一层臭油），因井下潮湿几乎全部漏电，同时电压也太大（四四○伏脱），极易发生危险（去年十二月间曾电死一工人），应立即将电线改为胶皮线，安装灯头开关、闸盒及降低电压为一一○伏脱。
    三、城子村矿的通风设备仍然不好，特别是上山（即工作地高于普通巷道的地点）放炮后，因空气不流通容易窒死人。应设风门风桥管理风的方向，加强压风机送风，使空气畅通。此外，该矿计划在井下装两部五十马力的电风扇，应当争取在五月前装好，因为天热后井下空气更不易流通了。
    四、两矿工会与行政方面应对工人加强教育，严禁工人偷挖煤柱，必须使用木制炮棍，不准再用铁制的，碰伤后应立即向工会报告。过去由于交班人不负责任，致使接班工人被砸死或电死。今后应建立上下班，交班制度及明确的层层负责制度。
    五、门头沟矿应健全医疗设备，提高医疗技术，在现有的经济条件下，可以先扩充外科设备（包括器械、ｘ光、手术室等），增聘外科大夫一人、护士三人，添置病床（以三百人一张为标准），以兼顾城子村等矿。在工人中加强卫生教育及卫生预防工作，两矿应经常发动防疫，体格检查等卫生运动。
    六、两矿工人多饮用由矿井下抽出来的水，因水中含有硫酸根，去年一月到十月两矿工人患肠胃病的即有二千九百卅一人之多。今后应设法引用山上的泉水或永定河水源修建自来水，以供全区使用；其具体计划，由自来水公司进行调查水源水量，矿区人口及其发展前途等，研究决定。
    七、门头沟矿工人浴池很不清洁，易传染疾病，最好改为喷浴，或设隔离池；在没有另建之前，应禁止患传染病的人入池。
    八、门头沟公共食堂，因为不适合工人的要求，只有极少数工人在里面入伙。绝大部分工人都是各自做饭，集积在宿舍内生火，对工人健康极为不利。厂方应对公共食堂加以照顾，减低菜饭价格。
    九、其他，如城子村矿全部机器及门头沟的一部分机器没有安装皮带盒子和齿轮盒子，容易发生危险；工人工作服不全或不适用；翻砂工人有的没有围裙、鞋盖，井下看吊泵的工人雨衣漏水等；门头沟矿的选煤机附近很多木板都损坏了，选煤机的立轴没有遮蔽物，很容易使工人受伤等，都应立即添补安装。此外，两矿工人宿舍极不清洁，下窑的衣服鞋子和作饭的碗筷放置一块，没有更衣室和贮存下窑衣服的地方等，也须逐步加以改善。
