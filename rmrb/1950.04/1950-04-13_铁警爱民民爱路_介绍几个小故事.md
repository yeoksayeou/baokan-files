　　Railway Police Love the People and the People Love the Railway
    ——Introducing a Few Short Stories
    Wang Shi
    I. Zhao Yongliang's Squad Extinguishes Fire
    In Hancun Village, Taigu, around 3 p.m. on December 8th of last winter, when the weather was freezing and water turned to ice, people in the village suddenly started clamoring and shouting "Fire!" loudly. Zhao Yongliang, the leader of the railway police squad, came out and saw the fire was raging. He hurriedly ran back, mobilized the whole squad to act immediately, and took water buckets and other tools to help the masses extinguish the fire. They bravely and eagerly rushed to the smoky and fiery roof. The wind made the fire even fiercer, but Zhao Yongliang's squad stubbornly persisted and finally extinguished the fire. The whole village was moved. Farmer Shi Qingji said with emotion: "If it weren't for the comrades' help, we probably wouldn't even have the few rooms we live in now. Now the railway police are truly working for the people."
    II. Militia Captain Rewarded
    At dawn on March 9th, Dong Saqi, a villager from Nanjia Village, the first district of Jie (zhou) County on the South Tongpu Railway line, was digging in the field near the railway. Suddenly, children Zhang Zhiwu and farmer Wang Guangming, while walking to kilometer 791, saw that the railway had been sabotaged by bandits and special agents. Six fishplates, thirty screws, and steel rails were piled up in a mess. They immediately told Old Dong loudly. Old Dong immediately returned to the village to report to Wang Changyan, the militia captain. Deputy captain Wang Cai rushed to the site of the sabotage and waited for the train to arrive. At about 8 o'clock, a train came from the northeast direction. Wang Cai immediately held up a red bundle as a warning signal and shouted, "Stop! Stop!" The train stopped. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau awarded the militia captain and deputy captain 300 catties of millet in bonus and a flag.
    III. Kang Defeng's Contribution
    Since the establishment of the Gulcun Village Railway Protection Team in the fourth district of Qixian County, the militia have consistently been active and responsible. On the evening of March 9th, around 4 o'clock, the railway protection team's Kang Defeng led two militiamen on patrol to kilometer 442 and 800 feet, where they found a brake shoe beam that had fallen from a train, lying across the center of the track. The group leader immediately picked it up and sent it to the station, allowing the train to pass safely. In addition to submitting a report to the office for submission to the railway bureau, the Linfen section also requested the local government to commend them.
    IV. Hu Chou'er is Not Bad
    Hu Chou'er, the railway protection informant in Yongan Village, the fourth district of Taigu, went home last November. One day, he met a fellow villager pushing a bundle of new wires, totaling more than 100 catties, on the train. He stepped forward to inquire about its origin and learned that it had fallen from the telegraph section when erecting the lines. He told him not to sell it but to hand it over to the telegraph section of the station. The comrades in the telegraph section expressed their gratitude.

　　铁警爱民民爱路
    ——介绍几个小故事
    王实
    一、赵永良班救火
    太谷韩村于去冬数九寒天，点水成冰的十二月八日下午三点左右，忽听得村人喧喧嚷嚷，高一声，低一声的吼着“救火！”铁警班长赵永良出来一看火势很猛，匆匆跑回动员全班马上行动，拿着水桶等工具，给群众救火，奋不顾身，争先恐后卷到烟浓火热的屋顶上。大风刮的火势更猛，但赵永良班顽强坚持，终于将火灾扑灭了。全村人都受感动。农民史清基感动的说：“要没有同志们的帮助，连现在住的那几间恐怕也没有了，现在铁警真正是给人民办事。”
    二、民兵队长得奖
    三月九日拂晓，南同蒲线上的解（州）县第一区南贾村村民董萨起正在铁路附近的田中挖地，忽有小孩张治武和农民王光明两人，行至七九一公里处，看见铁路被匪特破坏了，鱼尾板六块，螺丝三十个，钢轨乱七八糟堆在一起，他们便大声告诉老董。老董立刻回村报告民兵队长王长彦。副队长王才赶到破坏地点，等候火车开来。八时许从东北方向开来了列车，王才马上高举红色包袱作警号，高喊：“停车！停车！”列车便停下了。太原铁路局发给民兵正副队长奖金小米三百斤，旗子一面。
    三、康德风有功
    祁县第四区谷村护路小组成立以来，民兵一贯积极负责。三月九日晚上，四时左右，护路小组康德风率领民兵两个巡路到四四二公里八○○尺处，发现车上摔掉下之闸瓦梁一部，横阻于道心。该组长当即拿起送至车站上，使列车安全驶过。临汾段除呈请办事处转呈路局外，并请当地政府表扬。
    四、胡臭儿不差
    太谷四区永安村护路情报员胡臭儿，去冬十一月回家。有一日，他碰见该村一个老乡在车上推着一捆新电线，共有一百余斤，就上前问明它的来历，知道是电务段架线时掉的，便叫他不要卖掉，交给车站电务段。电务段同志表示感谢。
