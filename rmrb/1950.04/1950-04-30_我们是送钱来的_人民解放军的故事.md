"We've Come to Deliver Money"
    A Story of the People's Liberation Army
    On April 18th at a little after 10:00 AM, the rain was falling heavily. Some of the trolley cars had been pulled back into the factory because the rain protection equipment was inadequate. The shunting room of the South Repair Factory was filled with drivers and conductors, waiting for the rain to stop so they could put the cars back into service. But the rain only intensified, and the roads became even muddier; there was hardly a pedestrian to be seen. Just then, the door burst open, and two military comrades suddenly entered, their clothes completely soaked and their shoes covered in mud. The two military comrades then asked for the person in charge.
    One of the military comrades said, "We've come to deliver money. I am a member of the × Detachment of the Public Security Corps, my name is Wang Zengbo, and this is Deputy Platoon Leader Yu Yizhen. There are twenty-four of us comrades. We took the ring road trolley car from the back gate of Beihai Park and got off at Dongdan. Twelve of us were on the motor car, and twelve were on the trailer. The comrades on the motor car all bought tickets, but the twelve comrades on the trailer assumed that the person in charge on the motor car had bought them on their behalf, so they told the conductor, 'Someone on the motor car bought them all together!' After we got off at Dongdan, we quickly assembled and returned to the unit because it was raining. When we got back, the platoon leader called roll and asked everyone if they had bought their tickets. The twelve comrades on the trailer explained what happened, and that's how we realized they hadn't bought tickets. So the platoon leader and I quickly brought the money over." The workers were deeply moved by this. Driver Feng Changyuan picked up the phone and immediately reported this news to the Tianqiao Communications Station. All that could be heard on the phone was a noisy clamor: "Old Han! This news must be sent out! This is the excellent style of our revolutionary soldiers."

　　“我们是送钱来的”
    人民解放军的故事
    四月十八日上午十点多钟，雨下得很密，电车因为机件的防雨设备不够，有一部分收到了厂内。南修造厂的排车室内，坐满了司机员和售票员，准备等雨一停，马上将车子开出来。可是雨越下越紧，道路也更泥泞了，几乎看不到一个行人。这时，门一响，突然进来两位军人同志，混身的衣服已经淋得湿透了，鞋子上沾满了污泥。这时两位军人同志进门后便找负责人。
    一个军人同志说：“我们是送钱来的。我是公安总队第×中队队员，我叫王增波，那一位是副排长于易振。我们二十四个同志，刚才由北海后门坐环行路电车，到东单下车；我们在机车上了十二个人，拖车上了十二个人，机车的同志都买了票，拖军的十二位同志以为机车的负责同志给代买了，所以便告诉售票员说，机车有人一块买啦！我们到东单下车后，因为正在下着雨，匆匆集队回到队部。到队后，排长集合点名，并问大家是不是都买了票，拖车上十二位同志说了他们的情形，才知道他们没买票。所以排长和我赶紧把钱送来了。”工友们听了都很感动。司机员冯长源摘下电话，马上向天桥通讯站报告这一消息。只听电话里乱哄哄的嚷着：“老韩！这一消息一定要发出去呀！这是我们革命军人的优良作风。”
