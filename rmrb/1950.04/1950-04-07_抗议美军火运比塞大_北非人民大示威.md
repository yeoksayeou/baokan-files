Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 5th: According to reports, the French aircraft carrier "Dixmude" arrived in the port of Bizerte on the night of the 1st. It was carrying U.S. aircraft, scheduled to be unloaded there. The arrival of this aircraft carrier carrying military supplies in Bizerte has not only ignited the righteous indignation of the people of Bizerte, but also the anger of the people in other ports of Tunisia. A large number of police officers have been dispatched to the port, turning Bizerte into a city seemingly under siege. Machine gun emplacements have been set up at various intersections, surrounded by barbed wire, and military aircraft are circling and conducting reconnaissance over the city and harbor. However, the Tunisian people have responded to the ship's arrival with the strongest protests. Due to demonstrations and successive short-term strikes, authorities have ordered a 10:00 PM curfew in the city. On the 3rd, people from various places also held a large-scale demonstration in Tunis against the unloading of American aircraft at Tunisian ports.

　　抗议美军火运比塞大
    北非人民大示威
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：据报载，法航空母舰狄克西姆德号已于一日夜间驶达比塞大港。舰上载有美国飞机，预定在该港起卸。该航空母舰载运军火驶抵比塞大，不仅激起了比塞大港人民的义愤，而且也激起了突尼斯其他各港人民的愤怒。大批警察的开赴该港，使比塞大变成了一个像是被围的城市。各路口都设置了机枪阵地，四周有铁丝网围绕着，军用飞机在该市和港湾上空盘旋侦察。但突尼斯人民仍以最有力的抗议，答复该舰的驶来。由于示威游行和连续发生的短时罢工，当局已下令城内于晚上十点熄灯。三日，各地人民并在突尼斯城举行了反对在突尼斯各港起卸美国飞机的抗议大示威。
