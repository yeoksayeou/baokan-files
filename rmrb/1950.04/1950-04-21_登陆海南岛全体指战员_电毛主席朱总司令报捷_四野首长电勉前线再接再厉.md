Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 20th: After successfully landing on Hainan Island on the 17th, the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, engaged in large-scale amphibious operations, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the leaders of the Fourth Field Army, guaranteeing to cooperate with the Hainan Island people's armed forces and all the people of Hainan Island to quickly, thoroughly, and completely annihilate the remaining bandits on the island and liberate Hainan Island. The telegram reads as follows:

Respected People's Leader Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Fourth Field Army Leaders Lin, Luo, Deng, Tan, Zhao, and Tao:

Since receiving the glorious task assigned to us by Chairman Mao, to overcome the natural barrier of the vast sea between this spring and summer, crush the resistance of the remaining bandits' army, navy, and air force, land on Hainan Island, eliminate the remaining bandit troops, and liberate the people of Hainan Island, we have been working day and night, regardless of all fatigue, enduring hardship, and making all preparations with great intensity. In March, we successfully carried out four consecutive forceful crossings and assaults, landing on Hainan Island along the northern coast of Qiongzhou, victoriously joining forces with the heroic local people's armed forces, and successively defeating one enemy division and two regiments, annihilating one enemy regimental headquarters and four full battalions. Now our main forces began to forcefully cross the Qiongzhou Strait at 7:30 PM on April 16th, and after fierce battles at sea with enemy ships and aircraft, successfully completed the entire landing between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM on the 17th, and are now continuing to sweep forward into the interior. We are fully confident in guaranteeing to you that we will resolutely execute your orders and abide by your instructions, cooperate with the Hainan Island people's armed forces and all the local people, quickly, thoroughly, and completely annihilate the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops on Hainan Island, and complete the glorious tasks of liberating Hainan Island and ending the war in the Central and Southern regions.

Now the remaining enemy on the island is terrified and living in fear. We hope that you will be even more vigorous, continue your efforts, resolutely execute the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to completely annihilate the remaining enemy, and realize the early liberation of the entire Central and Southern regions.
