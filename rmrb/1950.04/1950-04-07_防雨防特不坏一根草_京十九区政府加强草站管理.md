　　Preventing Rain and Special Circumstances to Ensure Not a Single Blade of Grass is Ruined
    The Nineteenth District Government of Beijing Strengthens Management of Grass Stations
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Nineteenth District Government of Beijing is strictly preventing rain and special circumstances, and strengthening the management of grass stations. The proposed rain prevention measures are: straw stacks should be covered with mats in a sloping shape, and then the four corners should be tied with stones to prevent wind and rain from penetrating; drainage ditches should be dug around the straw stacks to prevent rainwater from flowing in. It is proposed that preventing "special circumstances" mainly relies on the masses, strengthening education for the masses, and establishing close contact with local troops and the Public Security Bureau, paying attention to pedestrians passing by the grass station. Grass station cadres must strictly adhere to the duty system, are not allowed to leave the straw stacks without authorization, and must conduct mobile patrols to strengthen management responsibilities. The district convened a meeting of grass station leaders on April 1st to implement the above-mentioned measures.
                                              (Nineteenth District People's Government)

　　防雨防特不坏一根草
    京十九区政府加强草站管理
    【本报讯】京市十九区区政府严格防雨防特，加强草站管理。提出防雨办法：草垛披席要坡形，然后在四角用石头拴住，以免风刮和雨水浸入；草垛四周挖顺水沟，以防雨水流入。并提出防特则是主要依靠群众，加强对群众的教育，并和当地驻军、公安局等取得密切联系，注意草站路旁的来往行人。草站干部要严守值班制度，不准擅自离开草垛，并要流动巡查，加强看管责任。该区已于四月一日召开草站负责人会议，将贯彻执行上述办法。
                                              （十九区人民政府）
