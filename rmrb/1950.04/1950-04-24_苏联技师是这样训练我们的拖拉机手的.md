Soviet Technicians Train Our Tractor Drivers
    Lu Chen
    The Soviet army has opened up broad avenues for the liberation of peasants and women in Lüda. From factories to rural areas, in economic construction and the mastery of science and culture, Soviet comrades have given enthusiastic and friendly assistance. Lisov trained the first group of female train drivers in Dalian, and Soviet agricultural technician Vasik patiently trained a group of female tractor drivers in Yingcheng Town, Dalian County.
    In August of last year, the Dalian County Government, in order to learn Soviet modern agricultural production, specially ordered a tractor. The first to sign up to learn to drive were Youth League members Yang Guihua and Cui Xiuyu. They had not received much education since childhood, only learning a little over 1,200 characters in the literacy movement. Their families were landless, their fathers and brothers had toiled for landlords during the Japanese occupation. Yang Guihua started doing odd jobs for landlords at the age of thirteen. Cui Xiuyu also began working odd jobs at Zhengji Vegetable Garden from the age of nine. Both are now nineteen years old. Their fathers and brothers were allocated land, houses, and livestock in the land redistribution movement.
    Vasik is an agricultural expert. In his teaching, he adopted a method that combined theory and practice. Every morning from eight to ten o'clock, he explained the structure, properties, and functions of the machines, providing detailed explanations with drawings, and disassembling and then reassembling the tractor for everyone to see. In the afternoon, they went to the fields for practice. Yang Guihua said: "The Soviet technician was really patient, personally guiding our hands to teach us how to drive the tractor." The tractor is a large machine, and driving it is very strenuous. When Yang Guihua was about to give up, Vasik warmly introduced her to the great achievements of Soviet women, often saying, "You are the new women of China. As long as you are willing to work hard, there is no task that cannot be accomplished." These encouragements increased their courage and strength. After the Soviet technician taught in the classroom and in the fields for more than twenty days, they had learned to drive the tractor independently.
    When Soviet technician Vasik approved Yang Guihua as the first to test drive the tractor, district cadres and farmers from all around came to congratulate them. Everyone's eyes were fixed on Yang Guihua's hands and feet. The tractor was like a domesticated animal, obediently following her every command. But Yang Guihua, sitting on the tractor, felt the air was too tense, and even breathing was unnatural. She said: "At that time, my heart was pounding so hard."
    "It doesn't matter, just pretend we are not on the vehicle, don't be afraid, drive...you are driving well," said Soviet technician Vasik, who was sitting in the cabin with her. A piece of land of more than ten acres was plowed in an hour, and everyone shook hands with Yang Guihua. Comrade Vasik also excitedly said: "Good job!"
    Yang Guihua was very happy and also very humble, saying: "Although we can drive the tractor and operate it skillfully, we cannot repair it, nor can we disassemble or assemble it. We are willing to continue learning, like Soviet women, to become genuine tractor drivers."
    During this year's spring plowing, the Lüda Administrative Office handed the tractor over to the Lüda Farm for use. These two female tractor drivers are already happily driving the Soviet tractor in the fields of the farm, carrying out spring plowing.

　　苏联技师是这样训练我们的拖拉机手的
    鲁晨
    苏军给旅大农民和妇女解放开辟了广阔的道路。从工厂到农村，从经济建设和掌握科学文化，苏联同志都给予热情的友谊帮助。李索夫在大连市培养出中国第一批火车女司机，苏联农业技师瓦西克又在大连县营城镇，耐心的培养出一批女拖拉机驾驶员。
    去年八月间，大连县府为了学习苏联近代化农业生产，特订购了一架拖拉机。第一批报名学习司机的便是青年团员杨桂花、崔秀玉，她们从小都没有读过书，在识字运动中才识到一千二百多个字。她们家都是房无一间地无一垅，爸爸、哥哥在日寇时都给地主抗过活。杨桂花十三岁，就给地主作零工。崔秀玉也从九岁时便开始到政记菜园作零工。她俩现在都是十九岁，她们的父兄在土地调剂的翻身运动中，都分得了土地房子和牲口。
    瓦西克，是个农业专家。他在教学技术当中，采取理论与实际相结合的办法，每天上午八点到十点讲解机器的构造性质和作用，画图详细的给解说，并将拖拉机全部拆开，而后再装备给大家看。下午便到田间去实习。杨桂花说：“苏联技师真耐心，亲自把着手教我们开拖拉机。”拖拉机好大一架机器，驾驶它是很吃力。当杨桂花坚持不下的时候，瓦西克亲切的向她介绍苏联妇女的伟迹，并时常说，“你们就是中国的新妇女，只要肯努力，没有完成不了的事业。”这些鼓励使她们增加了勇敢和力量。苏联技师在课堂里和田野上教了廿多天的光景，她们就已学会单独开拖拉机。
    当苏联技师瓦西克批准杨桂花第一名试验驾驶拖拉机时，区干部和四乡农民都赶来祝贺，大家的眼睛都盯着杨桂花的手和脚，拖拉机就像牲口一样，乖乖的听她随便左右使唤。但坐在拖拉机上的杨桂花却感到空气太紧迫，连呼吸都不大自然，她说：“在那时，怎么心里直蹦直蹦的。”
    “不要紧，就像我们都不在车上一样，别骇怕，开吧……开得还不错。”同她坐在车厢里的苏联技师瓦西克这样说。一片十亩多的土地，在一个钟头内耕完了，大家都向杨桂花握手。瓦西克同志也兴奋的说：“黑老少！”
    杨桂花很高兴，又很谦虚的说：“我们虽然会开拖拉机，也会熟练的运转，但是，还不能够修理，也不能拆卸或装配。我们愿意继续学习，像苏联妇女一样，成为一个名符其实的拖拉机驾驶员。”
    今年春耕时，旅大行署把拖拉机交给旅大农场使用，这两位女拖拉机驾驶员已经愉快地驾驶着苏联的拖拉机在农场的田野上进行着春耕了。
