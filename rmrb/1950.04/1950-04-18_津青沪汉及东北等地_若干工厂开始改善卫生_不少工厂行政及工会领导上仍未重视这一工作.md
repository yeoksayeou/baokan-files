Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: Since the Tianjin Factory Hygiene Inspection Group published its report on the results of the Tianjin factory hygiene inspection and proposed improvement suggestions in February, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou and Northeast China and other cities, have paid considerable attention to the work of improving factory hygiene facilities, and some factories have already begun to improve.

The Tianjin Textile Industry Trade Union invited medical personnel from the Municipal Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital to conduct lung examinations for employees in various China Textile factories. The examination of more than 5,000 employees of China Textile First Factory has now been completed. The first group of factory health care personnel trained by the Municipal Health Bureau for various public and private factories will soon be assigned to work in various factories. Several state-owned factories have established health and hygiene committees, conducted widespread health education for employees, and started to improve workshop spittoons, toilets, ventilation equipment, and hospital facilities. Private yarn factories such as Beiyang, Dasheng, and Hengyuan are also improving and expanding workers' dining halls, female workers' bathhouses, and medical rooms.

The Hygiene Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Labor Bureau, the Women Workers' Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northeast Textile Trade Union jointly formed a hygiene inspection team, which conducted a ten-day key hygiene inspection at the Northeast Textile Fourth Factory at the end of February. Afterwards, the inspection team assisted the factory in establishing a welfare section, a sanatorium, and improving the nursery.

The eleven factories affiliated with the Qingdao China Textile Company conducted hygiene inspections in early March, and some factories have already begun to improve hygiene facilities. For example, the First and Eighth Factories have purchased masks for cotton cleaning and dust sweeping workers; the Ninth Factory has improved ventilation equipment and workers' dormitories, and steamed dry food for workers.

The Labor Protection Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions organized a temporary factory hygiene inspection team on the 6th of last month, which went to labor hospitals and clinics in the East Shanghai and West Shanghai districts, as well as textile, hardware, dyeing and weaving, chemical and other factories, to collect materials on factory hygiene conditions in order to make improvement suggestions.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau has begun to investigate the hygiene facilities of 147 factories in the city, and held a preparatory meeting with relevant departments such as the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial trade unions to discuss the establishment of a Wuhan Municipal Factory Hygiene Committee and the organization of branches and sub-branches of the committee in various industrial trade unions and factories.

Up to now, the progress of improving factory hygiene in various regions is still very slow. Many factory administrative leaders do not pay enough attention to the physical health of workers, resulting in a perfunctory and procrastinating attitude in the work of improving hygiene. Some trade unions are not proactive enough in supervising this work. For example, the Tianjin China Textile Fourth Factory drafted more than a dozen improvement plans related to hygiene facilities in early March, but by the end of the month, the vast majority of resolutions had not been implemented. The budget for repairing toilets in the Qingdao China Textile First Factory was sent to the company more than a month ago, but the person in charge of the company put it aside and did not deal with it in a timely manner. In Shanghai, except for individual factories and the China Textile First Printing and Dyeing Factory, which have conducted a full-scale hygiene and safety inspection, general factories have not inspected or improved phenomena such as damp, smelly, and dirty toilets, unclean canteens and food, and kitchens adjacent to toilets or garbage dumps. The hospitals and clinics in various factories generally do not regard the regular cleaning and hygiene work in the factory as within the scope of their tasks; medical work is also not closely integrated with the health needs of the workers. The Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau once investigated 147 factories in the city's textile, oil pressing, and machinery industries, and found that there were 75 factories where workers should wear masks but did not, and 68 factories that should have hand washing facilities but did not. There were 131 factories where the lighting did not meet the standards, and 47 factories that should have disinfection pools but did not. All these situations urgently need to be improved.

### 津青沪汉及东北等地  若干工厂开始改善卫生  不少工厂行政及工会领导上仍未重视这一工作

　　津青沪汉及东北等地
    若干工厂开始改善卫生
    不少工厂行政及工会领导上仍未重视这一工作
    【新华社十六日讯】自二月间天津工厂卫生检查组公布天津工厂卫生检查结果报告和提出改进意见后，天津、青岛、上海、汉口各市和东北等地，对于改进工厂卫生设备工作，已引起相当注意，有些工厂并已着手改进。
    天津市纺织业工会邀请市立结核病防治院医务人员，分别到中纺各厂替职工检查肺部；现中纺第一厂五千余职工业已检查完毕。市卫生局代各公私营工厂训练的第一批工厂卫生保健人员，最近即将分配各厂工作。若干公营工厂已成立了保健卫生委员会，普遍向职工进行卫生宣传，并着手改善车间痰盂、厕所、通风设备和医院设备。私营北洋、达生、恒源等纱厂，对于工人饭厅、女工澡塘、医疗室亦正在改进和扩修中。
    东北人民政府工业部卫生局、东北劳动总局、东北总工会女工部及东北纺织总工会等联合组成的卫生检查组，已于二月底在东北纺织第四厂，进行了十天的重点卫生检查。检查组事后并协助该厂成立了福利科、疗养所，并改善了托儿所。
    青岛中纺公司所属十一个厂，已在上月初先后进行了卫生检查工作，有些工厂并已开始改进卫生设备。如第一、第八两厂已给清花扫风车工人买了口罩；第九厂已改善了厂内的通风设备和工人宿舍，并替工人蒸干粮。
    上海市总工会劳保部于上月六日起，组织了临时工厂卫生检查小组，分头到沪东、沪西等区的劳工医院、劳工诊疗所以及纺织、五金、染织、化工等厂，进行收集有关工厂卫生状况材料，以备提出改进意见。
    武汉市卫生局已着手调查该市一百四十七家工厂的卫生设备状况，并和市总工会、各产业工会等有关部门，开了一次改进工厂卫生设备的筹备会议，商讨组织武汉市工厂卫生委员会和在各产业工会、各工厂组织该会的分会、支会等问题。
    截至目前为止，各地改进工厂卫生的工作进行速度仍很缓慢。不少工厂行政负责人，未足够重视工人的身体健康，致在改进卫生工作中往往表现敷衍塞责的态度和麻痹拖沓的现象。有些工会对这个工作的督促亦不够积极。如天津中纺第四厂三月初就拟订好了十几项有关卫生设备的改进计划，但直到月底，绝大部分决议尚未付诸实施。青岛中纺第一厂修理厕所的预算表，送到该公司已有一个多月，而公司负责人却搁在一边，未予及时处理。上海方面除个别工厂和中纺第一印染厂，已进行了全厂卫生安全大检查外，一般工厂对于厂内厕所阴湿污臭、食堂和饮食不洁净、厨房毗连厕所或垃圾堆等现象，都未进行检查和改进。各厂的医院、医务室，大都不把厂内经常性的清洁卫生工作，看作任务范围内的事情；医务工作也没有和工人群众的健康要求密切地结合起来。武汉市卫生局曾经调查了该市纺织、榨油、机械等一百四十七家工厂，结果发现工人应带口罩做工而不带的有七十五家，应有洗手设备而没有的有六十八家。灯光不合标准的有一百三十一家，应有消毒池而没有的有四十七家。这种种情况都急待改进。
