What are Wavelength and Kilocycle?

Editor:

We often hear radio stations announcing kilocycles and meters at the beginning and end of broadcasts, but we don't know what these are based on. Please explain.

Comrade Qu Qingquan:

The Beijing People's Broadcasting Station has provided the following answer to your question:

Radio broadcasting relies on the propagation of radio waves. Radio waves are electrical fluctuations that travel at a speed of 300 million meters per second, meaning they can circle the Earth seven and a half times in one second.

There are thousands upon thousands of radio stations in the world, and thousands upon thousands of radio waves in the air. Why do we only hear one sound when listening to the radio? This is because each radio station broadcasts on a specific wavelength.

What is wavelength? To use an analogy, water waves rise and fall, forming individual waves. The distance from the highest point of one wave to the highest point of the next wave is called the wavelength.

Wavelength is measured in meters. We generally refer to wavelengths from 10 to 50 meters as shortwave; 50 to 200 meters as medium-shortwave; 200 to 3,000 meters as medium wave; less than 10 meters as ultra-shortwave; and more than 3,000 meters as long wave.

As mentioned earlier, radio waves travel at 300 million meters per second (this speed is the same for all radio waves), and the number of complete waves that pass in one second is the frequency. The number of radio waves emitted per second from an antenna is inversely proportional to the wavelength. For example, if the wavelength of the Central People's Broadcasting Station is currently 40 meters (i.e., the length of each wave), then dividing 300 million meters (the speed of radio waves per second) by 40 meters gives 7,500 kilocycles. This is the formula for calculating kilocycles from wavelength. Conversely, dividing 300 million meters by the kilocycles equals the wavelength.

### 什么是波长、千周？

　　什么是波长、千周？编辑同志：
    我们常听到无线电台在播送开始和终了时，报告千周与公尺，但不知千周与公尺是根据什么来的？请解答。
                            特军邮十一支队一中队  屈清泉屈清泉同志：
    你所询的问题，经北京市人民广播电台解答如下：
    无线电广播是靠无线电波传播的。无线电波是电的波动，其速度为每秒钟三万万公尺，即要是绕着地球走，每秒钟能绕七圈半。
    世界有成千成万的广播电台，空中有成千成万的无线电波，为什么收听广播的时候，只听到一种声音呢？这是因为每一个广播电台广播，都有一定的波长。
    什么叫波长呢？打个比喻说，水波一起一伏，成了一个一个的波浪，在一个波浪的最高点，到下一个波浪的最高点的距离就叫作波长。
    波长以公尺作单位。我们普通把十公尺到五十公尺的波长，叫作短波；五十公尺到二百公尺的叫作中短波；二百公尺到三千公尺的叫作中波，十公尺以下的叫作超短波，三千公尺以上的叫作长波。
    前面说过，无线电波每秒钟走三万万公尺（这种速度是任何电波都一样的），而每秒钟内所走完整的波的数目，就是周率。每秒钟从天线放射出来的无线电波的数目和波长是成反比例的。比如说现在中央人民广播电台的一个波长（就是每个波的长度）是四十公尺，那么就拿四十公尺除电波每秒钟走的三万万公尺，所得的数目，就等于七五零零千周。这就是用波长算千周的公式。与此相反，如果用千周除三万万公尺就等于波长。
