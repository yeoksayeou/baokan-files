Some Suggestions on the Collection of Revolutionary Historical Materials
    Yong Fu

　　In mid-March, the Preparatory Office of the Revolutionary Museum of the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture held its first exhibition of revolutionary historical materials. In over twenty days, the number of visitors reached more than 100,000. This shows how urgent the demand for revolutionary historical materials is from all walks of life. Therefore, I hope that relevant departments can establish a larger-scale and more systematic museum of revolutionary historical materials. Even if it is not possible to hold large-scale exhibitions today, they should hold as many exhibitions similar to this one as possible.

　　Holding such exhibitions and gradually establishing a systematic museum of revolutionary historical materials has many difficulties. This is because, in the past, we were in a long period of intense and cruel struggle, and it was quite difficult to preserve many historical materials, especially materials related to armed struggle and underground activities. Therefore, if we want to complete this work, there must be a process of collection and a process of identification and compilation, and we must mobilize everyone to collect, investigate, and donate materials, especially comrades who participated in the actual struggle must take action. Therefore, I suggest:

　　1. Not only should cultural and educational departments at all levels earnestly shoulder this work, but also the responsible leaders at all levels and departments should pay attention to and help with it. At the same time, because the collection of historical materials is also subject to time constraints, if we do not act early while everyone's memory is still fresh, the materials will be forgotten or damaged due to scattered storage. Therefore, government departments, military departments, and mass organizations at all levels should assign dedicated personnel to collect them as soon as possible, investigate old revolutionary comrades and those who are familiar with these materials, mobilize those who preserve them to donate them generously, and sort out old archives in the organs.

　　2. Currently, some comrades may think that only texts can reflect historical materials, and everything else is not historical material, so they feel that there is nothing to collect. In fact, this is not the case. The so-called revolutionary historical materials refer to all the physical objects that have occurred in the revolutionary struggles over the years and still remain to this day—revolutionary and counter-revolutionary weapons, proclamations, clothing, biographies of martyrs... Regarding these materials, everyone is definitely not unfamiliar, and as long as you pay a little attention, they will appear before our eyes or in our memories. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, various regions organized martyr biography compilation committees to compile biographies of martyrs, but this was interrupted due to the war; today, we can continue this work and combine the two. In addition, leading departments at all levels should also designate dedicated personnel to be responsible for regularly supervising and checking their work, sorting out, compiling, and submitting materials, so that the existing materials will not be lost or distorted due to repeated transfers.

　　3. The Ministry of Culture should mobilize as much external force as possible (departments related to historical materials) to participate in this sorting, collection, and compilation work. The specific method is: to organize a historical materials compilation committee or working group that does not leave their posts; its personnel can be appointed from various departments to extract a certain amount of time to help with the work, and the competent department should put forward key points and requirements and carry out the work by category according to the nature of each department. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region used this method to compile historical materials before, and achieved very good results. After doing this, not only can the difficulty of lacking cadres be solved, but also the complex materials can be specially sorted and identified according to the nature of each department, preventing errors caused by unfamiliarity or ignorance of the materials. At the same time, everyone will also be inspired by this and remember forgotten materials.

　　对革命史料征集工作的几点建议
    庸夫
    三月中旬，文化部文物局革命博物馆筹备处，举办了首次革命史料展览，二十余天中，参观人数共达十余万人。由此可知各界对革命史料的要求是怎样迫切。因此，我希望有关部门能建立一个较大规模且有系统的革命史料馆，而在今天大规模的举办展览还不可能的情况下，亦应尽可能地多举办一些类似这次的展览。
    举办这样的展览会，和逐步地有系统地建立革命史料馆，是有着许多困难的。这是因为过去长期处于紧张的残酷的斗争环境，许多史料的保存相当不易，特别是武装斗争和地下活动方面的材料，就更难保存。所以，如要完成此一工作，必须有一个征集过程和鉴别编纂过程，并须动员大家征集、调查、捐赠材料，特别是须要参加实际斗争的同志齐来动手。因此我建议：
    一、对于这一工作，不仅各级文教部门认真肩负起来，而且各级、各部门负责首长，亦应予以注意和帮助。同时因为史料的征集工作本身还受着时间性的限制，如果不在大家记忆犹新的时候，及早动手，材料便会被遗忘或因分散存放而毁损。因此，各级政府部门、军事部门、群众团体，便应及早指派专人征收，向老革命同志和熟悉这方面材料的人调查，向保存者动员使其割爱捐赠，清理机关中的旧存。
    二、目前可能有些同志认为除了文字能够反映史料以外，其他皆非史料，因此感到无物可征。其实不然，所谓革命史料，就是指在历年的革命斗争中所发生的一切仍留存到现在的实物——革命的与反革命的武器、文告、服装、烈士传略………。关于这些材料，大家决不陌生，只要稍一留心，就会涌现在我们的眼前或记忆中。抗日战争胜利后，各地区曾组织烈士传编纂委员会进行烈士传略编纂，后因战争关系而告中断；今天我们便可将这一工作继续下来，使两者结合进行。此外，各级领导部门还应该指定专人负责，定期督催检查他的工作，整理、编纂和上交材料，这样才能使既有的材料不致因为辗转遗失或发生错讹。
    三、文化部尽量动员一些外力（与史料有关的各部门），参与这一整理征收和编纂工作。其具体办法是：组织不脱离职务的史料编纂委员会或干事会；其人员可向各部门约聘，使其抽出一定时间帮助工作，由主管部门提出重点和要求，按性质分门别类进行工作。以前晋冀鲁豫军区编纂史料便曾采用此法，获得很好效果。经过这样作后，不但可以解决干部缺乏的困难，并可以从复杂的材料中，依各部门的性质作专门整理鉴别，防止了因材料不熟悉或不懂而发生的错讹。同时，大家也会因此得到启示，而把遗忘的材料记忆起来。
