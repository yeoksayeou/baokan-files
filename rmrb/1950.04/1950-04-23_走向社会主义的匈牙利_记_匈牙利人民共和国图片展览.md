　　Hungary on the Road to Socialism
    Notes on the "Photo Exhibition of the People's Republic of Hungary"
    By Our Correspondent Liu Ye
    The one hundred and ten Hungarian pictures exhibited in Zhongshan Park show how the Hungarian people, over the past five years, have opened up the road to socialist construction from the ruins of war.
    On February 13, 1945, the Soviet army liberated Budapest, the capital of Hungary. On April 4, the last of the German fascists in Hungary were driven out. From that day on, the working people of Hungary broke free from the shackles of feudal forces and capitalism and began to embark on the road of peaceful construction. To thank the Soviet army, the Hungarian people built a towering statue of liberty symbolizing peace on the top of Gellért Hill in Budapest.
    Before liberation, landlords, who accounted for two-thousandths of the rural population, held 43 percent of the country's land; three million landless poor laborers suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the privileged. Even the stables in the landlords' homes were equipped with modern electric lights, while the peasants lived in dark and dirty earthen kilns. The backward industry and agriculture served the reactionary ruling class. A country with agriculture as its mainstay could not supply its own food needs. After the German invaders launched the war, Hungary lost 45 percent of its national wealth. When the fascist bandits retreated, 90 percent of the bridges, 80 percent of the transportation lines, as well as locomotives, factories, houses, etc., were severely damaged. Although this photo exhibition only tells us a small part of the bandits' monstrous crimes, it is enough to make us suppress our inner anger. Let every peace-loving person in the world remember the crimes of the war instigators forever!
    Although the destruction of the war increased the difficulties in Hungary's construction, the working people of Hungary would not bow to difficulties.
    In 1945, Hungary implemented land reform, distributing 642,000 holds (one hold equals 0.57 hectares) of land to landless peasants. Guided by the Communist Party, the working people and intellectuals of the whole country bravely began the arduous work of construction. After the establishment of the People's Republic of Hungary in 1946, political power was truly in the hands of workers and peasants. The people's economic three-year plan began. The Soviet Union helped them with large quantities of cotton and modern textile machines. The state invested most of its resources in heavy industry. Industries such as aluminum, coal, crude steel, machinery, and textiles developed rapidly and all exceeded pre-war levels. By the time the three-year plan was completed in 1949, crude steel production exceeded 131.2 percent of the pre-war level; in 1949, locomotive production exceeded 822.3 percent of 1938. Mines, banks, foreign trade, etc., were all completely managed and operated by the people themselves. In the production of creating wealth for themselves, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet workers, Hungarian workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creative wisdom, and a large number of Stakhanovite movement activists emerged; in 1949 alone, there were 75,937 new inventions, of which 31,582 were adopted by the industrial bureau. These inventions saved the people of the whole country more than 240 million forints (one forint equals 8.5 cents in US dollars). The workers also received large bonuses. In agricultural production, 221 state tractor and agricultural machinery stations were established in three years, producing 3,800 new tractors. Farmers used these modern machines to cultivate on the estates. Due to the advocacy of the Communist Party, farmers increased their confidence in building socialism in rural areas, and they organized a large number of agricultural cooperatives, learning from the Soviet example.
    The state, according to the plan of the Hungarian Communist Party, stabilized the currency, bringing about a new look in economic construction and people's lives.
    The housing, food, and cultural life of the working people have been greatly improved. The Red Star Hotel on Széchenyi Hill in Budapest, the magnificent "Gellért," is no longer a playground for the privileged. It has become a holiday resort for model workers. Modern hospitals and nurseries have been established in vast factories and rural areas. Science and art have begun to serve the people themselves, and a large number of children of workers and peasants are learning advanced scientific knowledge and production methods in universities and training classes.
    Hungary's five-year plan has begun. The Hungarian people are actively opening up the road to socialism.
    The working people of Hungary are not only building their own new life. They are more concerned about the working people of the world. They firmly and enthusiastically support the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, smashing the conspiracy of imperialist war-mongers to instigate war. Look, here are 750,000 members of the democratic women's federation holding a grand demonstration to defend world peace. Here are the soldiers raising their iron fists and swearing: "Defend world peace."
    After seeing the pictures, the brilliant achievements of our brother country give us excitement and pleasure.

　　走向社会主义的匈牙利
    记“匈牙利人民共和国图片展览”
    本报记者  刘野
    中山公园展览出的一百一十幅匈牙利图片，显示了五年来的匈牙利人民，从战后的废墟上，怎样开拓了社会主义建设的道路。
    一九四五年二月十三日，苏联军队解放了匈牙利京城布达佩斯。四月四日，匈牙利境内的德国法西斯最后被逐出去了。从这一天起，匈牙利的劳动人民挣脱了封建势力和资本主义的枷锁，开始走上了和平建设的大道。匈牙利人民为感谢苏军，而在布达佩斯城里捷列特山顶上，建造了高耸着的象征和平的自由神像。
    解放前的匈牙利，占农村人口二千分之一的大地主们，握有全国百分之四十三的土地；三百万无地的贫苦劳动者，备受特权者们的剥削与压迫。地主家里连马厩都装置着近代化的电灯，而农民却生活在黑暗脏污的土窑里。落后的工业农业都是为反动的统治阶级服务的。一个农业生产占主要地位的国家，却不能供应本国食粮的需要。德寇发动战争后，匈牙利又损失了百分之四十五的国家财富。法西斯匪徒溃退时，百分之九十的桥梁，百分之八十的交通线以及机车、工厂、房屋等，遭到了严重的破坏。这次图片展览，虽然只告诉我们匪徒们滔天罪行很小一部分，但已足使我们抑制不住内心的愤怒。让世界上每一个爱好和平的人们，把战争挑拨者的罪恶永远记住吧！
    战争的破坏，虽然增加了匈牙利建设中的困难，但是匈牙利的劳动人民是不会向困难低头的。
    一九四五年匈牙利实行了土地改革，把六十四万二千荷尔（一荷尔等于零点五七公顷）的土地分给了无地的农民。全国劳动人民与知识分子们遵循着共产党的指导，英勇地开始了艰巨的建设工作。一九四六年匈牙利人民共和国成立后，政权真正掌握在工人、农民的手里。人民经济的三年计划开始了。苏联以大批的棉花，现代化纺织机帮助他们。国家把大部投资用于重工业上。铝、煤、生钢、机械、纺织业等迅速地发展着，并且都超过了战前的水平。在一九四九年三年计划完成时，生钢产量超过战前的百分之一三一点二；一九四九年，火车头的产量超过了一九三八年的百分之八百二十二点三。工矿、银行、对外贸易等都完全为人民自己管理和经营了。在为自己创造财富的生产中，在苏联工人们的热情帮助之下，匈牙利工人发挥了高度的劳动热情与创造智慧，大批的斯达哈诺夫运动者涌现出来了；一九四九年一年中，便有七万五千九百三十七种新发明，其中有三万一千五百八十二种被工业局采纳了。这些发明创造为全国人民节省了二万万四千多万福林（一福林折合一美元的八厘五分）的财富。工人们也得到了大量的奖金。在农业生产上，三年中建立二百二十一个国家拖拉机和农业机器站，共产出了三千八百部新拖拉机。农民们使用这些现代化的机械在田庄上耕作着。由于共产党的提倡，农民们增加了在农村建立社会主义的信心，他们组织了大批的农场合作社，学习着苏联的榜样。
    国家根据匈牙利共产党的计划稳定了币制，使经济建设和人民生活出现了一幅新的面貌。
    劳动人民的住房、饮食和文化生活都大大地提高了。布达佩斯斯阵尼山上的红星旅馆，富丽堂皇的“盖牙德拖”，再不是特权者们的游乐场了。这里成了模范劳动者的假期休息所。广大工厂、农村里都建立了现代化的医院和保育院。科学、艺术开始为人民自己服务，大批的工农子弟到大学、训练班里学习着先进的科学知识和生产方法。
    匈牙利的五年计划开始了。匈牙利人民正积极地开拓着走向社会主义的道路。
    匈牙利的劳动人民，不仅建设着自己的新生活。他们更关切着全世界的劳动人民。他们坚决地、热烈地支持着以苏联为首的世界和平阵营，粉碎帝国主义战争贩子挑拨战争的阴谋。你看，这里有七十五万的民主妇联的会员举行保卫世界和平的大示威。这里是战士们高举铁拳宣誓着：“保卫世界和平。”
    图片看完了，我们兄弟国家的辉煌成就给我们以兴奋和愉快。
