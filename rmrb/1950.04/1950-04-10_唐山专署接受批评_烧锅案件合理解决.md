    Tangshan Prefecture Accepts Criticism, Distillery Case Reasonably Resolved
    Editor:
        On March 26th, the People's Forum published Comrade Shi Ping of the Political Department of the 198th Division's concerns regarding the confiscation of his family's distillery. The situation described was largely accurate. The People's Forum editor pointed out that our "work is too slow and inefficient," and we agree. We do have these shortcomings in our work, and we will strive to overcome and correct them in the future. Here is our response to this issue:
        In June 1947, during the land reform in this area, the Yong Shun He distillery was confiscated by the peasants of Hujiatuo Town and five nearby villages. The peasants originally planned to continue distilling, but in January 1948, the government issued an order that liquor should be exclusively distilled by the government. The then-County Head of Leting County, County Head Liu, persuaded the masses to hand over the distillery to the Special Distilling Section of the Finance and Economics Office of the 13th Sub-district of Eastern Hebei for operation. In December of that year, it was ordered to be transferred to the Tangshan Liquor Company (which was directly under the provincial leadership).
        In November 1949, Leting County, based on the request of the manager of the distillery, Wei Xinran (i.e., Shi Ping's family member), brought this issue to the Prefecture. Because resolving this issue was not simply a matter of restoring industry and commerce, the Prefecture could not resolve it alone. Therefore, we reported the issue to the Provincial Government, suggesting that we should return it. However, the Provincial Government's instructions were that the situation and reasons were not understood, so it could not be handled, and instructed the Prefecture to investigate further. In fact, as mentioned above, the Yong Shun He distillery belonged to the Liquor Company. The Prefecture could only introduce this issue to the Tangshan Liquor Company, and suggested that it should be returned in accordance with the policy of protecting industry and commerce; on the other hand, we suggested that the unused tools be returned, and the tools still in use should be properly dealt with. The company sent Section Chief Yao to the Prefecture to discuss this matter. According to him, the inventory of the furniture received could not be found, and he remembered that a batch of materials had been issued (the owner did not mention this), which was very vague. At that time, we immediately expressed our hope to quickly clarify the situation and settle this matter, but the company did not reply after that, and we did not pursue it. As for the statement in the article that the Political Department sent three official letters to the Prefecture and his family sent letters to the Prefecture but received no response, in fact, the Prefecture did not receive any of them. This point should be clarified.
        We reviewed the reasons for the delay in handling this matter: 1. We did not pay close attention to this issue; 2. We believed that we had no right to return the distillery furniture in state-owned enterprises without the approval of higher authorities.
        Now we have notified the Liquor Company to implement the return on the one hand, and notified the owner to collect it on the other.
                                                 Tangshan Prefecture

### 唐山专署接受批评  烧锅案件合理解决

专栏：人民园地

　　唐山专署接受批评  烧锅案件合理解决编辑同志：
    三月二十六日，人民园地刊载一九八师政治部史平同志为其家烧锅被没收所提之问题，其中情形大致不差。人民园地编者指出我们“工作太拖沓效率低”，我们很同意。我们在工作上，确是有这些缺点，今后一定努力克服改正。现把这问题答复如下：
    一九四七年六月间，本区实行土地改革，永顺和烧锅被胡家坨镇及附近五个村子的农民没收了。农民本打算继续开烧，但恰好一九四八年一月政府就颁令酒归政府专烧，当时的乐亭县刘县长说服群众，把烧锅交给原冀东十三分区财经办事处专烧科经营。是年十二月，奉令又移交唐山酒业公司（该公司归省直接领导）。
    一九四九年十一月间乐亭县根据该号经理魏欣然（即史平的家长）的请求，把这一问题提到专署，因为解决此项问题不是单纯的恢复工商业的问题，专署独自解决不了，所以把这问题呈报省府，并提出我们应予发还的意见，但省府批示认为情况及原因不了解，不能处理，并指示专署再调查。事实上已如上述永顺和烧锅是归酒业公司了，专署只能把这问题介绍到唐山酒业公司，并提出按照保护工商业政策应当予以发还；另一方面，建议将不用的工具发还，现在尚在使用的予以适当处理。该公司曾因此派姚科长到专署来谈，据称接收的家具清册已找不到，曾记得已发给过一批物资（业主并未提到此事），所说甚为笼统。当时我们即表示，希望赶快把情况弄清楚，了结此事，但此后该公司也就没再答复，我们也没有追究。至于该文反映政治部给专署三封公函其家中给专署来信均未答复一节，事实上专署均未收到，此点应予声明。
    我们检讨未及时处理之原因：一、对这一问题抓的不紧；二、认为烧酒家具在公营企业中不经上级批准我们无权发还。
    现在我们已一面通知酒业公司实行发还，一面通知其本主领取。
                                                 唐山专署
