　　Wang Kuansi invents cylinder oil
    Technician Wang Kuansi of the No. 1 Oil Factory of the Taian Trading Company, seeing the difficulty the factory had due to a lack of cylinder oil, began to research and try to produce it using other raw materials. He succeeded after two experiments. The raw materials and methods for its manufacture are: eight catties of hemp seed oil, 1.9 catties of Vaseline oil, and one liang of rosin (ground into powder); first, boil the hemp seed oil, then pour in the Vaseline oil and rosin, and after boiling again, stir a few times with a stick, and it can be used.
    The cylinder oil invented by Wang Kuansi costs only 54,000 yuan per catty, and it is even better to use than the cylinder oil purchased from Harbin at 150,000 yuan per catty. If calculated according to the current amount of cylinder oil used in the factory, it can save 161,280,000 yuan per year (requiring six catties of oil per day, and the year is calculated based on 280 working days, requiring 1,680 catties of oil). The oil factory is preparing to give awards and commendations for this invention. (Wang Xingwu, Yu Xiantao, Zhang Haishan, No. 1 Oil Factory of the Taian Trading Company)

　　王宽思发明汽缸油
    泰安贸易公司第一造油厂技师王宽思同志，因见到厂中缺乏汽缸油的困难，就开始研究用别的原料来试造。他经过了两次试验，就获得成功了。其制造的原料及方法是：大麻子油八斤，华士林油一·九斤，松香一两（轧成粉末）；先把大麻子油熬开，然后倒进华士林油及松香，待再熬开，用棍子搅几遍，就可以使用了。
    王宽思发明的汽缸油，每斤成本仅为五四、○○○元，而比从哈尔滨所购每斤一五○、○○○元的汽缸油还要好使。如果按现在厂中使用汽缸油的数量计算，一年能节省一六一、二八○、○○○元。（每天需油六斤，一年按二百八十天开工日计算，需油一千六百八十斤）。对于这一发明，油厂正准备给以奖励与表扬。（泰安贸易公司第一造油厂王星五、于仙涛、张海珊）
