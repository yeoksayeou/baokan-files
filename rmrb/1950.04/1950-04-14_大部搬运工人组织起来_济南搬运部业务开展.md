　　Large Numbers of 搬运 (transport) Workers Organized
　　Jinan Transport Department Expands Business
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Five-thirds of the 搬运 (transport) workers in Jinan City have been organized, freeing themselves from the exploitation of feudal handlers. Under the unified deployment of the Municipal Transport Department, they are developing the municipal transport industry, and their lives have initially been guaranteed. The Municipal Transport Department of the Jinan Branch of Shandong Provincial Transport Company was officially established on February 1st this year. In the past two months, the number of 搬运 (transport) workers participating in the work of the Transport Department has increased from the initial 4,281 to 6,649, accounting for more than three-fifths of the city's total of about 10,000 workers. The number of vehicles has also increased from 2,741 to 4,088. According to March statistics, the average daily income per worker is 34斤 (jin - a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg) of millet, and their lives have been initially resolved. In order to improve the transport industry, after the establishment of the department, it first unified freight rates and formulated a detailed and comprehensive mileage chart, which was implemented after being approved by the Construction Bureau, and customers were very satisfied. Subsequently, a "transport responsibility loss compensation" system was established. For example, when 720斤 of millet were lost to the Grain Company, after full compensation was made, the reputation of the Transport Department was further enhanced. In order to overcome the chaos in transport order, the Transport Department, based on the opinions of the workers, also made a reasonable division of transport areas, and stipulated that workers and vehicles waiting for work should wait in the parking lot for unified mobilization, thus eliminating traffic congestion and vehicle congestion.

　　大部搬运工人组织起来
    济南搬运部业务开展
    【本报讯】济南市五分之三的搬运工人已组织起来，摆脱了封建把持者的剥削，在市区运输部统一调配下发展市区运输事业，生活初获保障。山东省运输公司济南分公司市区运输部于今年二月一日正式成立，两个月来参加运输部工作的搬运工人，已由最初的四、二八一名增为六、六四九名，占全市一万左右工人总数的五分之三强。车子亦由二、七四一辆增为四、○八八辆。据三月份统计，平均每工每日可收入三四斤小米，生活初步得到解决。为改进运输事业，该部成立后，首先统一了运价，制订了详细而完善的里程表，经建设局批准后执行，客商大为满意。继又建立了“运输负责损失赔偿”制，如损失粮食公司七百二十斤小米，经全部赔偿后，运输部信誉愈加提高。为克服运输秩序的紊乱现象，运输部又根据工人意见，将运输区域进行了合理的划分，并规定待活的工人及车辆，均在停车场等候统一调动，因此消灭了交通拥挤，车辆拥塞的现象。
