　　Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The National Railway Technical Management Regulations have been approved by the Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government and will be uniformly implemented in railways nationwide starting May 1st. This is the first nationwide unified basic regulation for railway technical management since China had railways. These regulations are based on the situation of Chinese railways and have absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. They were formulated after nearly a year of repeated research and discussion by the Minister of Railways and experts. The fundamental difference between this regulation and any old railway management methods is that it can further make national railway management an organic whole, and the departments of rolling stock, locomotives, engineering, and electrical will also get closer cooperation because of this. The regulations stipulate that all railway employees must earnestly study and accurately understand them, and must strictly implement all the provisions of the regulations, and always maintain the smooth flow of transportation, the good condition of locomotives and vehicles, the perfection of lines, bridges and buildings, and the correctness and sensitivity of signals and communication and other technical equipment, to ensure the safety, speed, and accuracy of train operation. In order to implement this decision of the Ministry of Railways, more than 400,000 railway employees across the country have fully launched a study upsurge. Along with the unified national railway technical management regulations, the railway operation rules, railway signal processing rules, and railway traffic accident handling rules will also be implemented simultaneously.

　　我国有铁路以来的创举
    铁路技术管理规程五一起在全国实行
    【新华社十四日讯】全国铁路技术管理规程业经中央人民政府铁道部部长批准，自五月一日起在全国铁路统一实行。这是我国自有铁路以来的第一个全国统一的铁路技术管理的基本法规。该规程是根据中国铁路的情况，并吸收了苏联的先进经验，经过铁道部长及专家将近一年的反复研究、讨论后制订的。它与任何旧的铁路管理办法根本不同之点在于能使全国铁路管理更进一步成为一个有机的整体，车、机、工、电各部门也因之得到更密切的配合。该规程中规定：凡属铁路职工，均须认真学习，确切了解，并须严格执行该规程之一切规定，经常保持运输的畅通，机车车辆的良好，线路、桥梁及建筑物的完善，信号与通信等技术装置的正确灵敏，以保证行车安全、迅速和准确。全国四十余万铁路员工为了执行铁道部这一决定，已全面展开学习热潮。与全国铁路统一技术管理规程同时实行的尚有铁路行车规则、铁路信号处理规则、铁路行车事故处理规则。
