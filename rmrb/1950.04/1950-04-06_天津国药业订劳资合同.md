　　Tianjin State-Owned Pharmaceutical Industry Signs Labor Contract
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal State-Owned Pharmaceutical Industry's collective labor-management contract, after five months of brewing and discussion, was officially signed on the 30th of last month. This contract changed the past unreasonable fixed monetary system and unified wage standards. It also abolished certain feudal management systems and people who were nominally paid but did no work. It also clearly stipulated specific measures for shop assistants' leave, work systems, and dismissals.
