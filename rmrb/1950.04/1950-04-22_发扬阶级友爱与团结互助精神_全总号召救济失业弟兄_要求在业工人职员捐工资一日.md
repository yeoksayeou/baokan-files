Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today issued a letter to workers across the country on the relief of unemployed workers. The full text is as follows:

Comrades, male and female workers and staff across the country:

Recently, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions issued an urgent appeal for the relief of unemployed workers in Shanghai, telling us about the difficult and serious situation of our worker brothers and sisters in Shanghai. Fifteen thousand of them are unemployed, and counting their families, nearly 500,000 people are living in extreme poverty. Some are living on thin gruel, while others are filling their stomachs with bean dregs, bean cakes, chaff, and wild vegetables. This situation cannot but arouse our deep sympathy, and at the same time, it makes us think of the fact that other cities also have more or less unemployed workers who are living the same difficult and distressed lives. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions first expresses its deep condolences on behalf of the workers of the whole country to our brothers and sisters who are suffering from unemployment!

We know that the main reasons for this difficult situation are: the long-term blockade and continuous bombing by American imperialism and the Kuomintang remnant bandits; the significant reduction in farmers' purchasing power due to the damage caused by long-term wars in the vast rural areas and the disasters suffered by some rural areas last year; the inevitable decline of those industrial and commercial sectors that used to cater exclusively to the bureaucratic bourgeoisie; and especially the transformation from the constantly rising and fluctuating prices of the past twelve years to stability today, making it impossible for some industrial and commercial enterprises that relied on speculation to maintain their operations, leading to shutdowns and bankruptcies, and so on. In short, this serious situation is partly the result of the long-term criminal rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang; at the same time, it is an inevitable phenomenon that will occur when the national economy transitions to normal development. Therefore, as long as we completely eliminate the remnant forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that have fled to Hainan Island and Taiwan, as long as the purchasing power of the rural areas gradually recovers due to the overcoming of disasters and this year's autumn harvest, the situation of industry and commerce can begin to improve; and after the completion of land reform and the increase in the purchasing power of the vast number of peasants, the national economic situation can fundamentally improve and move towards a prosperous and developing future. At that time, the problem of worker unemployment will be solved, and the lives of workers will gradually improve. This has already become a reality in Northeast China today. The Northeast has not only basically solved the problem of worker unemployment but also feels a shortage of labor.

However, the livelihood problems currently facing unemployed workers in Shanghai and other parts of the country cannot wait. We must take urgent measures to provide possible assistance and relief. Now, under the call of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the employed workers in Shanghai have responded enthusiastically and are donating one day's wage to support the movement to relieve unemployed workers. At the same time, workers in many factories and enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places have also spontaneously donated money for relief. We firmly believe that workers, staff, brothers, and sisters across the country will undoubtedly be deeply concerned about the serious living difficulties suffered by unemployed workers in various places and will be willing to provide all possible assistance in the spirit of class friendship and united mutual assistance. Therefore, we call on: all male and female workers and staff in public and private factories, enterprises, mines, shops, organs, and schools across the country to demonstrate the working class's high degree of class friendship and do their best to help unemployed workers in Shanghai and other places overcome the current serious difficulties. In late April and early May of this year, work one day of voluntary labor and donate the wages earned on that day to the fund for relieving unemployed workers. Workers, teachers, and staff in enterprises, organs, and organizations and schools where processing cannot be done should donate money voluntarily to the best of their ability for the relief of unemployed workers in Shanghai and other places. The income from one day's labor of employed workers and staff across the country can help unemployed workers in various places significantly alleviate the current living difficulties, and under the inspiration of this great class friendship, they can exert greater perseverance to overcome difficulties, overcome the current difficulties, and strive for the beginning of improvement that may come soon.

We believe that the broad masses of workers and staff across the country with a high degree of class consciousness will consciously and enthusiastically respond to our call! In the past thirty years of revolutionary struggle, our Chinese working class has overcome countless hardships and difficulties and finally achieved today's great victory. Now we have overthrown the reactionary rule that has long exploited us and established a people's regime led by our working class, with conditions a hundred times better than in the past. As long as we can continue to carry forward the heroic spirit of the past, unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and carry out unyielding struggles, we can certainly overcome the current economic difficulties and achieve the goal of building a new China that is democratic, prosperous, strong, and thriving.

　　发扬阶级友爱与团结互助精神
    全总号召救济失业弟兄
    要求在业工人职员捐工资一日
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国总工会今日发表为救济失业工人告全国工人书，全文如下：全国男女工人职员们：
    最近上海总工会为救济上海失业工人发出了迫切的呼吁，告诉我们，上海的工人兄弟姊妹处在如何困难的严重关头，他们已有十五万人陷于失业，连他们的家属计算，将近五十万人，生活十分困苦，有的喝汤粥渡日，有的以豆渣、豆饼、糠秕、野菜充饥。这种情况，不能不引起我们深切的同情，同时使我们连想到，其他城市也都有或多或少的失业工人，也在过着同样的艰难困苦的日子。中华全国总工会首先代表全国工人向我们陷于失业痛苦的兄弟姊妹表示深切的慰问！
    我们知道，造成这种困难情况的主要原因：是由于美帝国主义与国民党残余匪帮的长期封锁与不断轰炸；由于广大农村因受长期战争的破坏以及部分农村去年遭受灾荒的影响使农民购买力大为降低；由于过去那些专供官僚资产阶级享受的工商行业趋于必然的没落；特别是由于十二年来一直不断上涨波动的物价，今天转为稳定，使一部分靠做投机买卖的工商业不能维持而宣告歇业倒闭等等。总而言之，这种严重情况一方面是帝国主义和国民党长期罪恶统治所造成的恶果；同时也是全国经济要过渡到正常发展的时候必不可免要发生的现象。因此，只要我们将逃窜到海南岛和台湾的蒋介石匪帮的残余势力彻底歼灭，只要农村的购买力因灾荒的克服与今年的秋收逐渐恢复起来，工商业的情况便能开始好转；而在土地改革完成、广大农民购买力提高以后，全国经济状况，便可根本好转，走向繁荣发展的前途。那时工人的失业问题就会得到解决，并且工人的生活也就会逐渐改善起来。这在今天的东北，就已经成了现实。东北不仅已经基本上解决了工人失业问题，并且感觉到劳动力不足了。
    但是，目前摆在上海及全国各地失业工人面前的生活问题，是无法等待的。我们必须采取紧急的措施，予以可能的援助和救济。现在上海全市的在业工人，在上海总工会的号召下，已纷纷响应，捐助一天工资来救济失业工人的运动，同时北京、天津等地许多工厂企业中的工友也都自动地起来捐款救济。我们深信，全国的工人、职员、弟兄姊妹们，都必然一致的深切关怀各地失业工人所遭受的严重的生活困难，而愿意本着阶级友爱和团结互助精神，予以一切可能的援助。因此我们号召：全国一切公营、私营工厂企业、矿场、商店、机关、学校的男女工人职员们，都发挥工人阶级高度的阶级友爱，尽力援助上海及各地的失业工人，战胜目前的严重困难，在今年四月底五月初作一天义务工，把这天所得的工资捐作救济失业工人基金。在无法加工的企业、机关、团体学校中的工人、教员、职员们，则各尽所能自动捐款，作为救济上海及各地失业工人之用。全国在业工人、职员们用自己一天的劳动所得，就可以帮助各地失业工人相当减轻目前所遭受的生活困难，并使他们在这种伟大阶级友谊鼓舞之下，能发挥更大的毅力，设法克服困难，渡过目前难关，争取不久就可能到来的开始好转。
    我们相信：具有高度阶级觉悟的全国广大工人职员群众，是会自觉自愿地热烈响应我们这一号召的！我们中国工人阶级在过去三十余年的革命斗争中，克服了无数的艰苦困难，终于获得了今天的伟大胜利。现在我们已经推翻了长期压榨我们的反动统治，建立了以我们工人阶级为领导的人民政权，有了比过去优越百倍的条件，只要我们能继续发挥过去的英勇精神，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下紧密团结起来，进行不挠不屈的斗争，一定可以战胜目前的经济困难，而达到建设一个民主、富强、兴盛、繁荣的新中国的目的。
