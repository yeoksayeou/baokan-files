　　US Imperialism Builds Airfields in South Korea
    Preparing for Use by Kuomintang Remnants
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd] In order to expand the destructive and harassing activities of the Kuomintang remnants under its command against the new China, US imperialism is now actively preparing to allow the Kuomintang remnants to use South Korean air bases to bomb our country. Bandit Chiang has already sent Wu Tiecheng to South Korea via Tokyo on the 18th of this month. According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo on the 23rd, quoting a special dispatch from the Tokyo correspondent of the American Christian Science Monitor: "Chiang Kai-shek is negotiating with Syngman Rhee through his military and political assistants in Seoul to sign an agreement stipulating that the Kuomintang can use South Korean bases to fight against the People's Republic of China."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 23rd] The US imperialists are actively developing air bases in South Korea. The five airfields built in Jeju, Gwangju, Gunsan, Daegu, and Suwon were all completed in January of this year. Gimpo Airport near Seoul is the largest airport in South Korea and can accommodate B-29 Superfortresses. It is currently being repaired by US imperialism with an investment of 40,000 US dollars. Eighteen US Air Force personnel are stationed there, guarding and training sixty air force personnel of the Syngman Rhee puppet government.
    At the same time, the US imperialists recently sold a batch of fighter planes to the Syngman Rhee puppet government to help it massacre the Korean people. According to the pseudo "Ministry of National Defense Military Reporting Section," "Air Force Headquarters is currently assembling the recently purchased fighter planes." Burns, director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's "Korea" branch, publicly stated in Tokyo on March 28: "The Economic Cooperation Administration has allowed Korea to use US aid to purchase ten small aircraft."

　　美帝在南朝鲜修飞机场
    准备供国民党残匪利用
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国帝国主义为了扩大它所指挥的国民党残匪对新中国的破坏骚扰活动，现正积极准备让国民党残匪利用南朝鲜空军基地对我国进行轰炸。蒋贼已派吴匪铁城于本月十八日经东京赴南朝鲜。据塔斯社东京二十三日电引美国基督教科学箴言报驻东京记者专电说：“蒋介石正经由现在汉城的他的手下的军政助手们同李承晚谈判，以签订一项协定，规定国民党可使用南朝鲜的基地，对中华人民共和国作战。”
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】美帝国主义者正积极经营南朝鲜的空军基地。在济州、光州、众山、大邱、水原等地修筑的五个机场，已于今年一月间全部修竣。汉城附近的金浦机场，是南朝鲜最大的机场，可以降落Ｂ二九式超级堡垒，现正由美帝国主义以四万美元的经费补修中。美国十八名空军人员，正在那里看守，并训练李承晚傀儡政府的六十名空军人员。
    与此同时，美帝国主义者最近又以战斗机一批售与李承晚傀儡政府，以帮助其屠杀朝鲜人民。据伪“国防部军报道课”宣称：“空军总部现正装配最近购入的战斗机。”美国经合总署“韩国”分署署长班兹于三月二十八日在东京曾公开宣称：“经合总署准许韩国以美国的美援，购入十架小型飞机。”
