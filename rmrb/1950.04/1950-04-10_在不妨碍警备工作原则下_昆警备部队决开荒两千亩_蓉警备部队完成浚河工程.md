Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th: The People's Liberation Army unit garrisoning Kunming City is broadly and deeply engaged in a production and frugality campaign, under the principle of not hindering guard duties. They have decided to reclaim over 2,000 mu of wasteland and engage in sideline production and food conservation.

Since stationing in Kunming, the unit has begun to arrange production. The distribution of the over 2,000 mu of wasteland is largely complete, and two regiments have finished making all their farming tools. One regiment plans to complete the reclamation of 400 mu within the next ten days, and another regiment is also beginning to reclaim 600 mu of cultivated wasteland.

In terms of sideline production, the unit has raised over 240 pigs. Each regiment's tofu workshop has been established one after another, with one regiment having established four, averaging three liang of tofu per person per day. In addition, some regiments raise chickens and sheep, while others have bought large carts for transportation work. One company is engaged in mutual aid with the Central Machinery Factory, with the factory manufacturing 300 pieces of agricultural equipment and 25 basketball hoops for the troops, while the company, in addition to work and study, builds 1,360 meters of fence walls for the factory. This not only saves expenses for both sides but also strengthens the solidarity between workers and troops.

While launching production, the unit is also actively promoting a grain conservation movement. The "One Liang of Rice" conservation movement is being widely carried out in various units. All departments regularly inspect meals to strictly prevent waste, and there are strict regulations regarding the use of water, electricity, and other expenses.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th: The Chengdu Garrison Troops of the People's Liberation Army's Western Sichuan Military Region participated in the project to dredge the Fu River and Nan River around the city. Work commenced on March 14th and was fully completed by the 26th, finishing three days ahead of the original schedule. The unit dispatched approximately 2,500 personnel to participate in the work, undertaking 30,400 standard units of work (one standard unit involves excavating two cubic meters of stone and sand and transporting it 30 meters). The River Dredging Project Office, upon examining the project, deemed it fully up to standard and praised the troops for their rapid work. On the 23rd of last month, all representatives of the first Chengdu People's Representative Conference from all walks of life went to the construction site to express their appreciation and presented four silk banners. The unit is now summarizing work experiences, launching a celebration and commendation campaign, and preparing to further contribute to the production and construction of Western Sichuan.

    蓉警备部队完成浚河工程
    【新华社昆明七日电】警备昆明市的人民解放军某部，在不妨碍警备工作的原则下，普遍深入展开生产节约运动，决定开荒两千多亩，并从事副业生产和节约食粮。
    该部自进驻昆明以后，即着手布置生产，现在两千多亩荒地已大致分配完毕，有两个团的农具也已全部做好。某团计划在最近十天内完成垦荒四百亩的任务，某团也正在着手开垦熟荒六百亩。
    在副业生产方面，该部已养猪二百四十多只；各团的豆腐坊均先后建立，其中某团就开设了四所，平均每人每天能吃豆腐三两；此外各团有的喂养鸡、羊，有的买大车作运输工作。某连与中央机器厂互助变工，由工厂给部队制造农具三百件及篮球框二十五付，该连则于工作学习之余，替工厂筑围墙一千三百六十公尺。这不仅节省了双方的支出，并加强了工人与部队间的团结。
    该部于展开生产的同时，并积极展开节约粮食的运动。“一两米”节约运动正在各单位普遍展开。各部对饭菜都经常检查严防浪费，对于使用水电及其他开支也都有严格的规定。
    【新华社成都七日电】人民解放军川西军区成都市警备部队参加修浚城周围府河、南河工程，于三月十四日开工，至二十六日即全部完成，较原定计划提早完成三天。该部共抽出约二千五百人参加工作，担任三万零四百个标准工程（一标准工挖石沙两立方公尺，运出三十公尺），淘河工程处验考工程时，认为工程完全合乎标准，并赞扬部队工作迅速。成都市第一届各界人民代表会全体代表，曾于上月二十三日前往施工地点慰问，并献锦旗四面。现该部正在总结工作经验，开展贺功表扬运动，准备更进一步为川西的生产建设而努力。
