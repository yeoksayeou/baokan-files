　　Striving for Fairness and Reasonableness in Taxation
    Zhang City Exposes Merchants' False Accounts
    Industry and Commerce Investigation Team Conducts In-Depth Investigation
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to a report from the Chahar Daily on April 10th: The Zhang City Industry and Commerce Investigation Team has recently discovered cases of illegal merchants creating false accounts and evading taxes. When the hardware investigation team inquired about the 1949 business situation at Xin Feng Company, the company presented pre-prepared false accounts for "audit." The accounts showed an annual turnover of 9 million yuan. After adding and subtracting the cost of goods, sales, expenses, and inventory, the result was that the company made no profit. From the accounts, there was no apparent flaw. However, other hardware stores with similar capital and profit margins had a turnover of at least 20 million yuan last year. Therefore, it was judged that the company's reported turnover was false. Investigation team cadres repeatedly persuaded the company to tell the truth, but the company firmly denied it. At this point, the investigation team went to the Zhonghe Lumber Mill and Fuxing Construction Company, which had business dealings with Xin Feng Company, to gather information. It was discovered that Xin Feng Hardware Store had sold them 130,000 yuan, 460,000 yuan, and 170,000 yuan worth of wire nails and screws but only issued invoices without recording them in the turnover. However, small sales of odds and ends worth 2,000 to 3,000 yuan were fully recorded. Faced with this concrete evidence, the company could no longer deny it and had to take out two large sheets of paper from under the felt in the counter. Upon inspection, the turnover alone was 20 million yuan. This 20 million yuan turnover may not even be the true figure. However, based on the current turnover calculation, the company's actual industrial and commercial tax paid last year was only 10% of what it should have paid. In addition, the investigation team learned from the side that Xingye Hardware Store was doing one set of business in front of the counter and another behind the counter. Large transactions were done behind the counter and recorded in internal accounts, while small transactions were done in front of the counter and recorded in external accounts. The company's external accounts showed an annual turnover of 6 million yuan, while the internal accounts showed 29 million yuan, meaning the company's total turnover was 35 million yuan. The industrial and commercial tax paid by the company last year accounted for only 13% of the industrial and commercial tax rate. Furthermore, Fuxinglong, a flour mill, sold 5,000 catties of white flour to the Hui Muslim Cooperative without recording it in the turnover. After the investigation team found out, they not only failed to produce the true accounts but also brought out cakes and melon seeds, using despicable means to try to escape. In addition, in the tea industry, some were using the 1948 inventory valuation for today. For example, tea that sold for six yuan per catty in 1948 is still being calculated at six yuan, attempting to deceive. These situations show that many merchants have two sets of accounts or use various tricks to deceive the government. To prevent tax losses, how to check false accounts in the future is an important and regular task. Only by eliminating false accounts can various taxes be universally fair and reasonable.

　　力求税收的公平合理
    张市揭发商户假账
    工商业调查组深入调查
    【本报讯】据四月十日察哈尔日报消息：张市工商业调查组，近日连续发现不法商人造假账、偷漏税款事件。当五金调查组到新丰号询问一九四九年营业情况时，该号拿出久已备好之假账让“查账”。查看全年营业流水为九百万元，进货、销货、开支、盘存相加减结果，恰好不赚钱，从账上看不出丝毫破绽。但和该号同行，资金相等，利润率相同的五金行，去年营业至少都在二千万元以上。因此判断该号自报流水是假的。调查组干部反复动员说服，该号坚不承认。至此调查组即到与该号有交易行为的中和制材厂、复兴营造厂了解情况。发现新丰五金行去年卖给他们十三万元、四十六万元、十七万元之洋钉、螺丝光开了发票，而未记入流水；可是同时出卖之价格二、三千元的零碎货记的很全。该号在此真凭实据的情况下，再无法抵赖，只好从柜房内毡子底下，取出两张大纸单。查看结果，光流水一项即二千万元。这二千万元流水尚未必真实。但仅按目前流水核算结果，该号去年实纳工商税，仅为该号应纳的百分之十。另外调查组从侧面了解，查出兴业五金行，在柜台前做一套生意，在柜台后做一套生意。大宗的生意都在柜台后作、记内账，零碎的生意在柜台前作，记在外账上。该号外账全年营业流水为六百万元，内账为二千九百万元，这就是说该号总流水额为三千五百万元。该号去年所纳工商税，仅占工商税率的百分之十三。再如磨面业复兴隆卖给回民合作社白面五千斤，未上流水，经调查组查出后，不但不老实拿出真账反端出蛋糕瓜子等，使用卑鄙手段，企图幸免。另外在茶叶业中，有把一九四八年盘存估价，仍然用于今天。例如一九四八年每斤卖六元的茶叶，现在仍算六元，企图蒙骗。这些情况说明许多商人都有内外两套账，或用各种花样欺骗政府。为了使税收不受损失，今后如何检查假账，是一件重要的经常的工作，只有消灭了假账，各种税收才能普遍的做到公平合理。
