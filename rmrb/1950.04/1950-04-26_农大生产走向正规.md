　　Agricultural University Production Becomes Regularized

　　[This newspaper] The Agricultural University has formulated production regulations to promote the regularization of production. Initially, due to many unresolved issues in production, the school discovered the phenomena of students leaving their production posts without permission and working perfunctorily. Some students believed that the fruits of production belonged to the Student Union; some production groups used the excuse of being afraid of delaying their studies and planted drought-resistant crops. After repeated mobilization by the school administration and the Labor Construction Department of the Student Union, they have switched to planting spinach, cabbage, radishes, etc. Some groups who planned not to water and had not made ridges have also begun to make small ridges. The specific solution is based on the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, clearly stipulating that 5% of the labor proceeds should be used as a production fund (such as buying agricultural tools, etc.), and 95% is controlled by the production group. In order to rationally distribute the labor proceeds, the methods of work-point recording and democratic work evaluation have been adopted to ensure that those who work more get more. In addition, reward and punishment measures have also been established. In order to overcome the phenomena of trampling in the fields and damaging tools, the slogan "Everyone is responsible for protecting seedlings" has been put forward, which has attracted the attention of the students. Regarding the use of tools, a group responsibility system is implemented, with the group responsible for safekeeping and regular inspection. Slogans such as "Deep plowing and careful cultivation with more fertilizer application" and "No wasteland left, plant beans and radishes on the ridges" have been put forward. In the process, students from the Plant Pathology, Agronomy, Entomology and other departments personally carried baskets to collect manure, empty dung, smoke grass ash, and transport black mud, solving the fertilizer problem. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department organized people to pull plows, and female students like Xu Lingren continued to work hard despite being covered in sweat. Some groups have even organized students for production with the core of students who had participated in labor production in Shijiazhuang, Changzhi and other places in the past. Some also visited old farmers and experienced workers. When Comrade Huang Dongsen attended the Michurin Annual Meeting, he visited labor heroes Li Fucheng and Feng Chunfeng in Shijiazhuang, Shulu and other places, and learned many techniques for growing vegetables and preventing pests. Production has not only allowed students to develop a labor perspective, but also made the knowledge in textbooks applicable in practice. The students of the school are extremely enthusiastic about production, and are currently preparing to reclaim another six acres of wasteland on campus.

　　农大生产走向正规
    【本报讯】农业大学已制订生产规约，推动生产走向正规。该校起初由于生产上有许多问题未解决，曾发现私自离开生产岗位和应付的现象。有的同学认为生产果实归学生会；有的生产小组则借口怕耽误学习即种了旱庄稼。后经学校行政与学生会劳建部反复动员，已改种菠菜、白菜、萝卜等；打算不浇水没有做畦的小组，近日也开始作了小畦。其具体解决办法是根据统一领导、分散经管的原则，明确规定：劳动果实的百分之五为生产基金（如买农具等），百分之九十五归生产小组掌握。为了合理分配劳动果实，采取了记工和民主评工的办法，以保证多劳者多得。另外并定出奖惩办法。为克服地内乱踏、损坏工具等现象，曾提出了“人人有责爱护菜苗”，已引起同学们的注意。使用工具方面，实行小组负责制，由小组负责保管，随时检查。并提出“深耕细作多上粪”、“不留一厘白地，垅边点豆插萝卜”等口号。在进行当中，植病、农艺、昆虫等系同学亲自背筐拾粪、掏粪尿、熏草木灰、运黑泥，解决了肥料问题。畜牧兽医系组织了人拉犁、女同学许令妊等汗流浃背仍不休息。有的小组更以过去曾在石家庄、长治等地参加过劳动生产的同学为核心，组织同学生产。有的并访问了老农及有生产经验的工友。黄东森同志于召开米丘林年会时，曾访问了石害庄、束鹿等地的劳动英雄李福成、冯春风等，学习了许多有关种菜技术和防止虫害的方法。在生产中不但使同学锻炼了劳动观点，同时课本上的知识也作到了具体应用。该校同学生产情绪极高，目前正准备再开垦校内六亩荒地。（农大通讯组）
