Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation celebrated its first anniversary on April 3rd. The federation held a commemorative meeting at its new location at 10:00 AM, presided over by the federation's vice-chairman, Deng Yingchao. She reviewed the work of the All-China Women's Federation over the past year and pointed out the direction for future efforts. She said that the organization of women's masses across the country has greatly developed in the past year, and the All-China Women's Federation has done a lot of work, its own institutions have also expanded, and work departments have gradually been added. However, most of the past work belonged to national and international activities, and there was a failure to deeply understand the situation of women's masses in various regions. The guidance for the work of women's federations in various regions was not timely enough. The most important shortcoming is that the quality of work of the All-China Women's Federation still cannot keep up with the increasingly developing women's mass movement across the country, and there is insufficient initiative in the work. Therefore, she pointed out that work should be carried out in a more planned and focused manner according to the guiding principles and tasks of the Chinese women's movement this year, and necessary work and inspection systems, work discipline, etc., should be established. She said that the heads and staff of all departments of the All-China Women's Federation should work hard to do their jobs well in the future. To this end, it is necessary to study theory, study policies, strengthen business and cultural learning, and pay attention to cultivating new cadres; every working comrade should use their brains more to think about their work, cultivate a careful, practical, serious, and responsible work style, and overcome the phenomenon of sloppiness and shirking responsibility; in particular, it is necessary to strengthen the sense of responsibility and improve work efficiency. Finally, she encouraged women comrades of all parties and new and old cadres working in the All-China Women's Federation to unite and help each other, learn from each other, learn skills, and do their jobs well.
　　At 3:00 PM, the federation held a tea party. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, Yang Zhihua, Deputy Minister of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other heads of various organizations were invited to participate. Members of the Standing Committee of the federation, executive committee members in Beijing, alternate executive committee members, heads of various departments, and heads of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation attended. The tea party was presided over by Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation. During the meeting, everyone expressed many valuable opinions on how workers, youth, women, students, and other people's organizations can cooperate and help each other in their work. The heads of various organizations also introduced the work focus and activities of the Central Committee of the Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation this year.

　　全国妇联成立一周年
    邓颖超号召深入群众
    团结互助学会本领做好工作
    【新华社四日讯】四月三日是中华全国民主妇女联合会成立的一周年，该会于是日上午十时在新会址举行纪念会，由该会副主席邓颖超主持。她检讨了全国妇联一年来的工作，并指出了今后努力的方向。她说：一年来全国妇女群众的组织大为发展，全国妇联做了不少工作，本身的机构也扩大，工作部门也逐渐增设。但过去的工作大部分是属于全国性及国际性的活动，未能深入了解各地妇女群众的情况，对各地妇联工作的指导不够及时，其中最主要的缺点是：全国妇联的工作质量还赶不上全国日益发展着的妇女群众运动，工作上的主动性还不够。因此，她指出：应根据今年中国妇女运动的方针任务，更有计划有重点地进行工作，建立必要的工作及检查制度、工作纪律等。她说：全国妇联各部负责人及工作人员今后要努力做好工作。为此必须学习理论，研究政策，加强业务、文化的学习，注意培养新干部；每个工作同志要多用脑子思考业务，养成仔细、切实、认真、负责的作风，克服草率、塞责的现象；特别要加强责任心，提高工作效率。最后她勉励在全国妇联工作的各党派妇女同志及新老干部要团结互助，互相学习，学会本领，做好工作。
    下午三时该会举行茶会，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬、中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志、中华全国学生联合会主席谢邦定、中华全国总工会女工部副部长杨之华等各团体负责人均应邀参加，该会常委及在京执委候补执委各部负责人及北京市民主妇联负责人均出席参加。由全国妇联副主席李德全主持。会中，大家都就工人、青年、妇女、学生等各人民团体如何配合工作和互相帮助等问题，发表了很多宝贵的意见。各团体负责人又分别介绍了青年团中央、全国青联、全国妇联等团体今年的工作重点与活动概况。
