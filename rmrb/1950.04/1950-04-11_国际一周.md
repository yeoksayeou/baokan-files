　　Guerrilla Warfare Flames in the Philippines and Malaya
　　The recent developments in the people's guerrilla warfare in the Philippines and Malaya have heavily struck the imperialist bloc's newly arranged plan to enslave the people of Southeast Asian colonies and semi-colonies.

　　As early as a year ago, the Quirino puppet government guaranteed to "eliminate the rebels" within a year. In January of this year, the Quirino government's army and police, under the direct command of the American military advisory group, dispatched seventeen garrison companies, assisted by artillery, tank units, and fighter planes, to launch a large-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army's strongholds in central and northern Luzon. American lackeys in the Philippine Senate even demanded that Quirino must "complete the task of suppressing the communist guerrillas within six months" on the grounds that it "threatened the safety of American base facilities." The American military advisory group also intensified its planning for "encirclement and suppression." But what was the result? The result was: the Philippine People's Liberation Army launched a powerful offensive to respond to the "encirclement and suppression" by the US-Philippine reactionaries, and to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the People's Anti-Japanese Army (established on March 29, 1942). This offensive expanded to all parts of Luzon, threatening Manila, where the Quirino government is located, Baguio, where Quirino "resides," and Clark Air Base, the main US air base, causing "Americans living in the Philippines to have a sense of unease as if sitting on a powder keg" (Associated Press).

　　At the same time, the British colonial authorities' colonial war against the people of Malaya, which began in June 1948, is also increasingly in trouble. In order to cope with the accusations of the monopoly capitalists, the British colonial authorities announced the so-called "Anti-Bandit Month" from February 26th. On the one hand, they forced the conscription of more than 300,000 residents of Malaya into the army to replace the duties of the rear police, in order to transfer more police to fight against the guerrillas, and intensified the blockade of the guerrilla areas. On the other hand, they greatly increased reinforcements, including the 26th Gurkha Infantry Brigade transferred from Hong Kong and the Royal Air Force's 57th Lincoln Bomber Squadron sent from the United Kingdom. They attempted to reverse the decline with a more brutal offensive. But they failed once again. The Malayan People's Liberation Army launched a widespread and victorious counterattack in all states of the Federation of Malaya. With more frequency, larger scale, and stronger firepower, they attacked barracks, patrols, police stations, railways, highways, and plantations, inflicting great damage on the British army and police. The "Anti-Bandit Month" declared to be over by the British colonial authorities on April 2 became the counterattack month of the Malayan People's Liberation Army. The British colonial authorities have always called the Malayan people's armed forces "bandits" and "terrorists," but now even the former Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia, Killearn, had to loudly proclaim: "At least it should be called a guerrilla war!"

　　As is well known, the Philippines is an important link in the American Pacific aggression line. The United States retains twenty-three military bases in the Philippines for a term of ninety-nine years. At present, the United States continues to attempt to organize a "Pacific Alliance" against the people of the East through the Philippines. Malaya is Britain's "dollar factory" and Britain's "hub in Southeast Asia." It is conceivable that US and British imperialism will launch more frenzied offensives. However, the development of the armed struggles of the people of the Philippines and Malaya has loudly warned the Western aggressors that their attempt to conquer the people's movements in the Philippines and Malaya by force is nothing but a dream.

　　One Year of the "Black Pact"

　　The "North Atlantic Treaty," signed on April 4th last year by the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Portugal, has now been a full year old. The facts of the past year have proved that this so-called "defensive" treaty, which was touted at the time of its signing, is a "black pact" planned by US imperialism to undermine the United Nations and prepare for a new war.

　　Under the active instigation of American warmongers, the war machine of the North Atlantic aggressive group is already in motion. The United States and its European vassal states have passed the so-called "strategic concept of the overall defense of the North Atlantic region." According to this "strategic concept," the United States itself undertakes the "long-range strategic bombing missions" to bomb the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, Britain and the Netherlands are designated to undertake the "task of maintaining very important maritime transportation," and all European capitalist countries are designated to undertake the task of providing cannon fodder. The "bilateral agreements" signed between the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty countries to receive US military "aid" stipulate that the vassal states must use US military supplies entirely for the purpose of launching aggressive wars, must provide their important raw materials and supplies to the United States at any time, and must open the doors of all their military organs to allow American "military delegations" to supervise the organization and training of the "recipient country's" armed forces. According to the intention of the US General Staff, the vassal states of the "North Atlantic Treaty" are divided into five strategic regions—Western Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, North America (Canada, Iceland), and the North Atlantic—to facilitate unified command by the United States. The "collective defense plan" passed by the "North Atlantic Treaty Defense Committee" held in The Hague on April 1 is a further concretization of the US imperialist aggressive war plan.

　　The European vassal states have been tied to the war chariot of the American war monger group. The territory, territorial waters, and airspace of these countries have actually been occupied by the United States. These countries can no longer maintain any military, political, or economic secrets from the United States. The reactionary governments of these countries must supply their people and resources for the use of the United States. Therefore, these countries have lost their national independence. This is the purpose that Acheson's "total diplomacy" wants to achieve. At the same time, US imperialism is attempting to expand the "North Atlantic Treaty" and organize "Mediterranean Treaty" and "Pacific Treaty" with the same aggressive nature, using these treaties as tools for preparing for new wars and ruling the world. Today, US imperialism is taking various actions to undermine the United Nations Charter and paralyze the United Nations agencies, with the aim of replacing the United Nations with this "black pact" and strangling the United Nations.

　　The people of the "North Atlantic Treaty" signatory countries (including the American people) have never approved this "black pact" and will never approve it. They are using increasingly strengthened struggles to destroy this "black pact" and to strive for national independence and defend world peace.

　　The Heroic Struggle of the French People

　　On the rostrum of the 12th National Congress of the French Communist Party, a banner reading "The French People Will Never Fight Against the Soviet Union" was hung. The walls of the venue were covered with slogans "Calling for the Struggle for Peace." The report and discussion of the Congress paid special attention to the issue of how to establish a broad people's united front to fight for peace, bread, freedom, and French independence. Under the general goal of defending world peace, the French people are bravely launching struggles on two fronts, namely the struggle to thwart war plans and the struggle against fascism.

　　US imperialism, through the aggressive and enslaving tools of the "Marshall Plan," the "North Atlantic Treaty," the "Western European Union," the "Military Aid to Foreign Countries Act," and "Bilateral Agreements," attempts to organize an unjust war to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. In this war, France has been assigned the task of being the main supplier of cannon fodder. At the same time, US imperialism openly came forward to assist the French reactionaries in participating in the colonial war against the Vietnamese people, in order to save the French invading army in distress and turn Vietnam into a springboard for attacking the Chinese mainland. However, under the strong leadership of the French Communist Party, the French people have relentlessly engaged in a frontal struggle with the warmongers. The warmongers want to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for aggression against the Soviet Union. Their reply is: they will never fight against the Soviet Union! The warmongers want to accelerate the completion of preparations for a new war. The French people, especially the French working people, from the ports of France to the ports of North Africa, have launched a comprehensive anti-"military aid" movement, refusing to load and transport American killing weapons. The warmongers vainly attempt to obstruct the Vietnamese people from achieving a complete victory in the liberation war. However, the French people refuse to produce and load military supplies for the war in Vietnam and demand the withdrawal of the invading troops in Vietnam. The anti-"military aid" movement and the opposition to the colonial war in Vietnam have become concrete contents of the movement to defend peace. With the arrival of the first batch of US "military aid" materials in France, this struggle is entering a more intense stage.

　　On the other hand, the ruling group of France, holding the orders of the masters of Wall Street, is accelerating the fascistization of French politics. In early March, in order to pass the dirty so-called "Anti-Idleness Sabotage Law" in the National Assembly, the Bidault government mobilized the police and gendarmerie to prevent debate and drove Communist Party members out of the meeting. According to this reactionary bill, the Bidault government can arbitrarily use the charges of "sabotaging the production of war materials," "damaging or hindering the transportation of national defense materials," and "depressing military morale" to sentence striking workers and peace supporters to imprisonment. It is clear that this bill is not only aimed at "suppressing" the struggle against "military aid," but also a step in preparing for a new war. It should be particularly pointed out that the anti-French Marshallization parties, the Bidault and de Gaulle groups, are also preparing to revise the current proportional representation electoral law, in order to prevent the Communist Party, which is now the largest party in France (accounting for 183 seats out of 619), from obtaining representative seats in the next election. They also want to turn the French parliament into one like the British parliament, completely stifling the voice of the people. Not only that, they are also trying to follow the old path of 1939, further abolish the constitution of the Fourth Republic, and declare the Communist Party illegal, clearing the way for war and the rule of US imperialism.

　　But the times are very different. The French people already have the rich experience of the anti-Hitler struggle, the strong leadership of the French Communist Party, the unity of a strong and consolidated working class, the unity of the working class and other working people, and they already have the firm will to fight for peace, bread, freedom, and independence. Therefore, they also have the power to thwart all the conspiracies of US imperialism and its tools—the French reactionaries—to incite a new war and establish fascist rule.

    菲律宾和马来亚的游击战争烽火
    最近菲律宾和马来亚的人民游击战争的发展，沉重地打击着帝国主义集团新近布置的奴役东南亚殖民地半殖民地人民的计划。
    早在一年以前，季里诺傀儡政府就保证在一年以内“肃清叛军”。今年一月间，季里诺政府军警在美国军事顾问团的直接指挥之下，曾出动十七个警备连，并以炮兵、坦克部队及战斗机协助，大举进攻吕宋中部与北部的菲人民解放军据点。菲参议院中的美国走狗们甚至以“威胁到美国基地设备的安全”为理由，要求季里诺必须“在六个月完成镇压共产党游击队的任务”。美国军事顾问团亦加紧策划“清剿”。但是结果怎样呢？结果是：菲人民解放军发动了强大的攻击，来答复美菲反动派的“清剿”，来庆祝民抗军成立八周年（民抗军成立于一九四二年三月二十九日）。这一次攻势扩展到吕宋各部，使季里诺政府的所在地——马尼拉，季里诺“驻节”的所在地——碧瑶以及美国的主要空军基地——克拉克机场附近，都感受威胁，使得“住在菲律宾的美国人，有着一种坐在火药库上的不安感觉”（合众社）。
    与此同时，英国殖民地当局于一九四八年六月间开始的进攻马来亚人民的殖民战争，也日益陷入困境。英殖民当局为应付垄断资本家的责难，曾于二月二十六日起宣布所谓“反匪月”。一方面强迫征调马来亚三十余万居民入伍，代替后方军警的职务，以便抽调更多的军警对游击队作战，并加紧对游击区的封锁。另一方大举增援，其中包括从香港抽调的第二十六廓尔卡步兵旅和自英国派去的皇家空军第五十七林肯轰炸机中队。他们企图以更残酷的进攻来挽救颓势。但是他们是又一次地失败了。马来亚人民解放军在马来亚联邦各州展开了广泛的胜利反击。他们以更多的次数、更大的规模、更强的火力，袭击营房、巡逻队、警察所、铁路、公路、种植园，给予英军警以极大的损害。英国殖民当局于四月二日宣告结束的“反匪月”，成了马来亚人民解放军的反击月。英国殖民当局一向称马来亚人民武装为“土匪”和“恐怖分子”，而现在连前驻东南亚特别专员基伦，也不得不大声疾呼：“至少应该说是游击战争”了！
    如所周知，菲律宾是美国太平洋侵略线的重要一环。美国在菲律宾保有为期九十九年的二十三个军事基地。而目前美国正继续通过菲律宾，企图组织反对东方人民的“太平洋联盟”。马来亚是英国的“美元制造厂”，是英国在“东南亚的枢纽”。美英帝国主义将发动更加疯狂的进攻，是可以想像的。但是菲律宾和马来亚人民武装斗争形势的发展，已经响亮地警告了西方的侵略者，它们想用武力来征服菲律宾和马来亚的人民运动，这不过是在作梦。
    “黑约”一周年
    去年四月四日由美、英、法、加、意、荷、比、卢、丹、挪、冰（岛）、葡等十二国所签订的“北大西洋公约”，到现在已经整整一年了。这个在签订时所标榜的所谓“防御”公约，一年来的事实证明乃是美帝国主义为破坏联合国与准备新战争而策划的“黑约”。
    在美国战争贩子们的积极策动之下，北大西洋侵略集团的战争机器已在开动中。美国及其欧洲的仆从国家通过了所谓“北大西洋区域整体防御的战略概念”。根据这个“战略概念”，美国自己承担轰炸苏联和人民民主国家的“长距离战略轰炸任务”，英国与荷兰被指定担任“维持很重要的海上交通运输的任务”，所有欧洲资本主义国家都被指定担任炮灰供给者的任务。美国与北大西洋公约国家所签订的接受美国军事“援助”的“双边协定”，又规定了仆从国家必须把美国军火完全用于发动侵略战争的目的上，必须把他们的重要原料和物资随时供给美国，必须打开他们一切军事机关的门户，让美国的“军事代表团”去监督“受援国”武装部队的组织与训练。按照美国参谋部的意图，“北大西洋公约”的仆从国家被划分为五个战略区域——西欧、北欧、南欧、北美（加拿大、冰岛）和北大西洋，以便利美国的统一指挥。四月一日在海牙举行的“北大西洋公约防务委员会”所通过的“集体防御计划”，就是美帝国主义的侵略战争计划的进一步具体化。
    欧洲仆从国家已经被缚在美国战贩集团的炮车之上。这些国家的领土、领海和领空，实际上已为美国所侵占。这些国家对美国不能再保持军事上、政治上、经济上的任何秘密。这些国家的反动政府必须把他们的人民和资源供应美国使用。因此这些国家已丧失了国家的独立。这就是艾奇逊的“总体外交”所欲达到的目的。同时，美帝国主义正企图扩大“北大西洋公约”，组织具有同样侵略性质的“地中海公约”和“太平洋公约”，利用这些公约作为它准备新战争和统治世界的工具。今天美帝国主义正采取着破坏联合国宪章，瘫痪联合国机构的各种行动，其目的是要以这种“黑约”来代替联合国，扼杀联合国。
    “北大西洋公约”签字国的人民（包括美国人民在内），从来没有批准这个“黑约”，也永远不会予以批准。他们正以日益加强的斗争来摧毁这个“黑约”，来争取国家的独立和保卫世界的和平。
    法国人民的英勇斗争
    在法国共产党第十二次全国代表大会的主席台上，悬着“法国人民永不与苏联作战”的横额。会场四壁挂满了“号召为和平而奋斗”的标语。大会的报告和讨论，特别重视如何建立争取和平、面包、自由与法国独立的广大人民统一战线的问题。法国人民在保卫世界和平的总目标下，正英勇地展开两方面的斗争，即挫败战争计划的斗争和反对法西斯化的斗争。
    美帝国主义通过“马歇尔计划”、“北大西洋公约”、“西欧联盟”、“军事援外法案”、“双边协定”这些侵略性和奴役性的工具，企图组织进攻苏联和人民民主国家的不义战争。在这个战争中，法国被派定了作为主要的炮灰供给者的任务。同时，美帝国主义公开出面援助法国反动派，参加进攻越南人民的殖民战争，以期挽救陷于困境的法国侵略军，使越南变成进攻中国大陆的跳板。但是在法共的坚强领导之下，法国人民不屈不挠地与战争贩子们进行了正面的斗争。战争贩子们要驱使他们充当侵略苏联的炮灰。他们的答复是：决不对苏联作战！战争贩子们要加速完成新战争的准备。法国人民特别是法国的劳动人民，从法国的港口到北非的港口，却展开了全面的反“军援”运动，拒绝起卸和运输美国的杀人武器。战争贩子们妄图阻挠越南人民取得解放战争的全部胜利。但是法国人民拒绝生产和装载运往越南作战的军火，并要求撤回在越南的侵略军。反“军援”运动和反对越南的殖民战争，成为保卫和平运动的具体内容。随着美国第一批“军援”物资的抵达法境，这个斗争正进入更为紧张的阶段。
    在另一方面，法国的统治集团举着华尔街主子的命令，正在加速进行法国政治的法西斯化。三月初，皮杜尔政府为了要在国民议会中通过肮脏的所谓“反怠工破坏法”，竟调动警宪，阻止辩论，并把共产党议员逐出会场。根据这个反动法案，皮杜尔政府可以任意用“破坏生产战争物资”、“破坏或阻碍运输国防物资”、“沮丧军心民心”的罪名，判处罢工工人与和平拥护者以徒刑。很明显，这个法案不仅旨在“镇压”反“军援”的斗争，而且是准备新战争的步骤。应该特别指出反法国的马歇尔化政党，皮杜尔和戴高乐集团，还正在准备修改目前的比例制选举法，以期使今天法国最大的政党——共产党（在六一九席中占一八三席），在下次选举中不能取得代表的席位。他们也想把法国的议会变成和英国的议会一样，完全窒息人民的声音。不仅如此，他们还企图走一九三九年的老路，进一步废除第四共和国宪法，宣布共产党为非法，为战争和美帝国主义的统治扫清道路。
    但是时代大不相同了。法国人民已经有反希特勒斗争的丰富经验，有法共的坚强领导，有强大而巩固的工人阶级的团结，有工人阶级与其他劳动人民的团结，他们已有为和平、面包、自由与独立而斗争的坚决意志，因而他们也就有力量挫败美帝国主义及其工具——法国反动派煽动新战争和建立法西斯统治的一切阴谋诡计。
