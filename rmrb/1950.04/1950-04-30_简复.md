　　To Wang Zhihe and others:
    The specific measures for this year's university admissions are being studied by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and cannot be answered immediately.

    To Editors Cui Fangmei and five others:
    The admission procedures for National Beijing Normal University this year have not yet been drafted. Please pay attention to the school's admission advertisements at that time. It has not yet been determined whether the school will admit transfer students this year; if they are admitted, they will not be exempt from the entrance examination. The school has a prospectus from the previous academic year for your reference. Please provide a mailing address so that we can send it to you.

          To Editor Xu Yiting:
    Your suggestion to build a sewage pool in Bingbuwa or at the west entrance of Gaobei Hutong has been forwarded to the Municipal Health Bureau. After investigation by the bureau, the original sewage pool at the west entrance of Gaobei Hutong is silted up and the pool walls are damaged. We have now obtained the consent of the local police station and health team, and the local people will repair the pool walls themselves. The silted-up parts of the drainage ditch will be dredged by the Health Bureau.

                                   To Editor Zhou Seke:
    It has not yet been decided whether the North China People's Revolutionary University will enroll students in the next term.

          编者许宜亭君：
    你建议在兵部洼，或高碑胡同西口内，修建秽水池事，已转告市卫生局。经该局派员调查，高碑胡同西口内，原有秽水池，现已淤塞，池墙损毁。现已征得当地派出所及卫生小组的同意，由当地群众自修池墙，其管沟淤塞部分，由卫生局派工疏浚。
