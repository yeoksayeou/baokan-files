　　Fengtai Locomotive Depot Reforms Waste Oil, Saving Expenses
    [Our Newspaper] The Fengtai Locomotive Depot's internal oiling team reformed waste oil, saving 704 kilograms of axle oil, equivalent to over 5 million yuan. To save national expenditure, under the leadership of team leader Hou Xijing, the team heats up the previously unused oil sludge mixture to separate the oil and mud, then through sedimentation and filtration, usable axle oil is produced, and the test results are good.

　　丰台机务段改制废油  节省开支
    【本报讯】丰台机务段内勤给油组改制废油，节省车轴油七○四公斤，合五百余万元。为节省国家开支，该组在侯锡敬组长的领导下，将过去不用的油泥混合的油底经加热后，使油和泥分开，再经沉淀和过滤，即成可用之车轴油，试验效果良好。
