　　Reduce National Expenditure, Improve Work Efficiency
    Northeast Region Further Implements Streamlining
    Most of the 70,000 Personnel Made Redundant Last Winter Have Been Transferred to Production Departments
    [This newspaper dispatch] Special Correspondent Tian Liu reports: The Northeast Region is currently further developing the streamlining movement. The initial streamlining work in the region was carried out before the State Council decided on nationwide streamlining, so it has not yet reached a fully perfect level. The total number of personnel in various departments in the entire Northeast Region still exceeds the standards set by the State Council by more than 10,000 people. At the second meeting of the Northeast People's Government Committee held on March 20th, Chairman Gao Gang once again proposed that, according to the State Council's streamlining instructions, in-depth research should be conducted to further implement this work. A staffing committee will be established under the leadership of the government to specifically supervise and manage the staffing and authorized strength of various agencies. Since last September, the entire Northeast Region has carried out a large-scale streamlining and thrift campaign, which was successively and victoriously concluded in various places from the end of last year to the beginning of this year. After streamlining, the organizations were lean and efficient, the layers were reduced, the division of labor was strict, the responsibilities were clear, and the work efficiency was significantly improved. This movement was carried out under the direct leadership and call of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government. In order to enable this movement to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of various organizations and staff at all levels, improve work efficiency and save and cherish national property, and adapt to and promote the large-scale economic construction of the Northeast, the first Northeast People's Congress, the Northeast People's Government, and the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee successively made resolutions on implementing streamlining in various agencies and departments in the Northeast. Comrades Gao Gang and Li Fuchun also successively gave reports and mobilizations on streamlining at cadre meetings. Most provinces, cities, and counties held party member conferences and cadre meetings to study and discuss the decisions on streamlining and study Comrade Gao Gang's report "To Whom Does Honor Belong?", further recognizing the significance and importance of streamlining. Therefore, a universal streamlining and thrift movement throughout the region was launched without exception in various agencies, troops, and schools. Songjiang Province held a democratic conference of all cadres to carry out streamlining while examining work and leadership. Liaodong Province combined streamlining with the movement to change work styles and combat waste. Andong City and other places implemented a "fixed staffing and quota system" for government work to determine staffing. The Lushun-Dalian area combined streamlining with clearing up agency materials, plugging the source of waste. Anshan City carried out streamlining and thrift with emphasis on different departments. In enterprise departments, the focus was on checking cost accounting, raw material and personnel waste. In agencies, the focus was on checking the implementation of work plans, the utilization of working hours, streamlining redundant personnel and establishing office systems. However, this movement was not all smooth sailing. During the movement, especially in the early stages, it encountered many resistances, obstacles and difficulties: for example, some cadres did not understand that the significance of streamlining was to improve work efficiency, adapt to the needs of the new situation, and that the government was absolutely responsible for redundant personnel, which caused many lower-level cadres and staff to feel uneasy and their emotions fluctuated; for example, some cadres' minds were filled with conservative ideas of following the old ways and being content with the status quo. In streamlining, they did not bravely abandon and thoroughly reform the old organizations and systems, and establish new organizations and systems according to the needs of the new situation and new tasks, but only circled around reducing a few people; some departments did not start from improving work methods and improving work efficiency to carry out streamlining, so it was impossible to save too many personnel to an appropriate level. The Northeast Region's streamlining and thrift movement achieved victory and the following achievements by overcoming these obstacles and solving these difficulties.
            Cutting and Merging Unnecessary Institutions
            Enriching Production and Construction Organizations
    This achievement is first manifested in the fact that various organizations are generally more streamlined and efficient than before after streamlining. War-time institutions have been cut and merged and simplified, peaceful construction organizations have been enriched, general institutions have been streamlined, economic production organizations have been enriched, overlapping organizations have been eliminated, and the number of levels has been reduced, making handling affairs easier. The organs party committee under the Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the CPC in Heilongjiang Province overlapped with the work of the organization department and propaganda department of the municipal committee. Because there was no need for an organs party committee organization in such a small city with not many organs and departments, it was abolished in this streamlining. The municipal people's government also reorganized and divided the organization and business of various bureaus, which not only saved 186 staff members, but also made the bureaus more specialized and improved work efficiency. In the streamlining process, the various departments and offices of the Northeast People's Government have adopted the policy of streamlining organizations and reducing levels to make the organizations more lean and flexible. For example, the administrative office had one section and three sections with a total of 67 cadres before streamlining. After streamlining, only one section was set up, and four secretaries were set up under the director to divide the work and be responsible as assistants to the director. Not only was the command flexible and the work efficiency was improved, but also the number of cadres was reduced by 28. However, it is wrong to think that reforming the organization is only to abolish and merge a few departments to achieve the purpose of streamlining. It is indeed completely necessary to cut and merge those redundant and overlapping organs, and this must be carried out thoroughly, but this is only one aspect. There is another situation in various organizations. This is the one-size-fits-all organizational form left over from the rural work period and the war, where one department takes care of everything and does not manage anything well. It is no longer suitable for the needs of the current new situation and new tasks, especially for the needs of urban work with convenient transportation and vigorous industrial construction. It must be replaced by organizations with clear responsibilities, strict division of labor and specialization. This is what the administrative office of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee did in this streamlining. Originally, the administrative office had one section and five sections, with teams under the sections, and then clerks, staff members, and administrative staff, etc. To do one thing, it first had to go through the office, then the section, then the team, and then the clerks, staff members, and even administrative staff, layer upon layer, with many procedures, little work done, and a lot of trouble. In the streamlining process, all these layers of organizations were abolished. No teams were set up under the sections. When things happened, the office directly handed them over to the sections for handling. At the same time, according to the conditions of working in the city, the division of labor needs to be more precise and specialized. The office was changed from the past one section and five sections to one section and seven sections. In form, it seems that the organization of the office became larger after the streamlining. In fact, the number of personnel was reduced by 118, and the division of labor was more clear and more specialized. In this streamlining, the Northeast Region abandoned and reformed the old organizations, established new organizations that meet the needs of the new situation and new tasks, and saved more than 70,000 cadres and staff members, which not only reduced a large amount of national expenditure, but also transferred most of the redundant personnel to production departments and grassroots organizations, strengthened production forces, and enriched grassroots organizations.
            Strict Staffing and Establishment of Systems
            Rational Use of Human and Material Resources
    The entire streamlining movement in the Northeast was combined with thrift. There were specific and unified regulations for the number of personnel, the use of horses and cars, and supply standards. During the streamlining process, various agencies generally cleared out the small warehouses of their own agencies. As a result, many important materials and equipment that were useless to the work of the department were cleared out and handed over to the state. Various places also stopped issuing one to three months of funds based on the size of the "family property" of each department, saving the state a large amount of expenditure. Due to the strict staffing and use of automobiles, the organs directly under the Northeast Greater Administrative Region alone reduced 87 automobiles, and gasoline alone could save 2.3 billion Northeast currency per month. If the automobile repair costs and driver salaries are included, it will greatly exceed this number.
    Another gain from the streamlining work in the Northeast is the establishment of various systems, which has greatly improved work efficiency. For example, various agencies have generally established office systems, overcoming the previous problems of not distinguishing between work and rest and mixing public and private affairs. All public contacts, talks, meetings, and handling of daily work are all done during office hours. In the streamlining process, the Northeast People's Government also established a collective office system. The chairman and various ministers all participated. Except for emergencies that are resolved at any time, problems are handled and documents are reviewed during office hours. They are discussed, decided, approved, and handled on the spot, overcoming the previous problems of not contacting each other, slow resolution of problems, and document travel. Work efficiency has therefore increased threefold. Other systems, such as meeting systems, reporting systems, and document processing systems, have been successively established in various places. Most agencies have also made their own tasks, responsibilities, and division of labor into "regulations" and "detailed rules for handling affairs," so that each department and even each staff member has systems, regulations, and bases for carrying out work, overcoming and preventing delays, shirking responsibilities, and other problems. The Northeast People's Government is currently drafting a series of systems and regulations, such as regulations on rewarding cadres, regulations on punishing corruption and dereliction of duty, and regulations on the use, promotion, and demotion of cadres, to consolidate the existing achievements of streamlining and maintain and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of staff at all levels to complete arduous construction tasks.
            Establishment of Responsibility System and Work Quotas
            Strengthening the Careerism and Creativity of Cadres
    Establishing a responsibility system for government work and determining the work quotas of each staff member by time and measurement is another important achievement of streamlining in the Northeast. It has greatly improved the work efficiency of each staff member, and also made the streamlining work more scientific, rational and thorough. In the streamlining process, various places have deeply studied Comrade Gao Gang's report "To Whom Does Honor Belong?", and the cadres' thinking has been greatly improved. The cadres' sense of career has been strengthened, their work attitude has become more serious and responsible, and their enthusiasm and creativity have been greatly developed. Agencies at all levels and most cadres have carefully studied the work tasks and responsibilities of their own departments, and formulated their own and the department's work plans, rules, and disciplines. Many areas have also adopted the "calibration" method, actually testing the time required for each job to determine the work quota for each person and the staffing number of the entire agency. In Andong City, even the work of sweepers and messengers was first tested to determine how much time each job took, and then the work tasks for each person per day were stipulated. The Liaodong Provincial Taxation Bureau reduced 38 people during the streamlining process, but the work was not only not affected, but the accounting section created a new record for government work. The reason is also that each person was given a certain work requirement, and each person completed the task according to the plan, and the "fixed quota and fixed task system" was implemented. Because the responsibilities of the cadres were clear, a scientific work system was established, and the inspection of the work of the counties and the leadership of the tax collection work were strengthened, the tax revenue of the province exceeded the completion target in the first quarter of this year. The Bank of Rehe Province also calculated the number of cadres based on the needs of the work during the streamlining process. As a result, the number of personnel was greatly reduced, saving more than 2,000 "salary points" per month.

　　减少国家开支提高工作效率
    东北区进一步贯彻整编 
    去冬编余七万人员大部转入生产部门
    【本报讯】特派记者田流报导：东北区现正进一步展开整编运动。该区初步整编工作是在政务院决定全国整编之前进行的，所以还未达到十分完善的程度。东北全区各部门人员总数，较之政务院所规定的标准尚超出万余人。高岗主席在三月廿日举行的东北人民政府第二次委员会上，再次提出根据政务院的整编指示，深入研究，以求进一步贯彻这一工作。并将在政府领导下设立定员委员会，专门监督与管理各机关的编制与定员事宜。去年九月以来，东北全区曾进行了一次大规模的整编节约运动，直至去年底今年初各地才先后胜利结束。整编后机构精干，层次减少，分工严密，责任明确，工作效率显著提高。这一运动是在中共中央东北局、东北人民政府直接领导号召下进行的。为使这一运动达到发挥各种组织机构及各级工作人员的积极性创造性，提高工作效率和节省爱护国家资财，适应和推进东北大规模的经济建设的目的，东北首届人民代表会议、东北人民政府、中共中央东北局曾先后作出关于在东北各机关部门实行整编的决议；高岗同志、李富春同志又先后在干部会上作了整编的报告和动员；各省、市、县大都召开了党员大会和干部大会进行研究、讨论有关整编的决定和学习高岗同志《荣誉属于谁》的报告，进一步认识了整编的意义和重要，因此普遍全区的整编节约运动，便在各机关部队学校中无例外的开展起来。松江省举行全体干部民主大会，在检查工作检查领导中进行整编；辽东省则结合着改变作风、反浪费运动进行；安东市等地实行机关工作的“定员定额制”确定编制；旅大地区在整编中结合清查机关物资，堵塞住浪费的来源；鞍山市则按不同的部门进行有重点的整编节约，在企业部门主要是检查成本核算，原料及人员的浪费，机关中重点是检查工作计划的执行、工作时间的利用和精简冗员建立办事制度等。但这一运动并不是一帆风顺的。在运动中特别在运动初期，曾遇到不少抵抗、阻碍和困难：如有些干部不了解整编的意义是为了提高工作效率、适应新形势的需要和政府对编余人员绝对负责的政策，很多下级干部和工作人员惶惶不安，情绪波动；如某些干部思想中存在着因循守旧安于现状的保守思想，在整编中他们不是根据新形势新任务的需要，勇敢抛弃和彻底改革旧机构旧制度，建立新机构新制度，只是在减掉几个人上打圈子；也有的部门不从改进工作方法提高工作效率着手进行整编，因此便不可能将过多的人员节省到恰当的程度。东北区的整编节约运动是在克服这些阻碍解决这些困难中达到胜利，获得下列成绩的。
            裁并简化不必要机构
            充实了生产建设组织
    这种成绩首先表现在，整编后各种机构普遍较前紧缩精干，裁并和简化了战争机构，充实了和平建设机构，精干了一般机构，充实了经济生产机构，取消了重叠组织，并层次减少办事简便了。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔中共市委所属的机关党委会与市委组织部宣传部工作重叠，因为在那样一个不太大的城市里，机关部门不太多的情况下是用不着有机关党委会组织的，这次整编就把它取消了。该市人民政府也重新调整和划分了各局的组织与业务，不但节省了一百八十六个工作人员，还使各局更加专业化，工作效率提高了。东北人民政府在整编中各部、处都采取了紧缩机构减少层次的方针，使机构达到进一步精干灵活。如行政处整编前是一室三科共六十七个干部，整编后只设一科，另在处长下设四个秘书，分工负责成为处长的助手，不仅指挥灵活工作效率提高，干部还减少了二十八个人。但认为改革机构只是取消与合并几个部门便达到整编的目的就错了，的确裁并那些多余的重叠的机关是完全必要的，必须彻底进行，但这只是一方面。在各种机构中还存在着另一种情形。这就是农村工作时期和战时遗留下来的，那种一个部门包罗万象，什么都管什么都管不好的一揽子组织形式。它已不适合目前新形势新任务的需要，特别是不适合交通方便大力进行工业建设的城市工作需要了。必需以职责明确、分工严密和专业化的机构来代替它。中共中央东北局行政处这次整编中就是这样作的。原来行政处设有一室五科，科下有股，再下是科员办事员及事务员等等，作一件事情先经处后经科再转股而后交科员、办事员以至事务员，层层叠叠手续繁多，办事不多，麻烦不少。整编中将这层层叠叠的组织一律取消，科下不再设股，遇事由处直接交科办理，同时根据在城市工作的条件下，需要分工更加精密专一，该处由过去的一室五科改成一室七科，形式上好像整编后该处机构更加庞大了，实际上人员减少了一百一十八人，分工更加明确更加专业化了。东北区在此次整编中，抛弃和改革了旧机构，建立起适合新形势新任务需要的新机构，并节省了七万多干部和工作人员，不但减少了国家大量的开支，且编余人员大都转入生产部门和下层组织，加强了生产力量，充实了下层组织。
            严格编制建立制度
            人力物力合理使用
    东北整个的整编运动是和节约结合进行的，凡人员数目、马匹、汽车使用、供给标准等都有具体统一规定，各机关在整编中大都清查了本机关的小仓库，结果有许多与本部门工作毫无用途的重要的物资器材，都清出来交给国家，各地并根据各部门“家底”大小，停发一至三个月的经费，节省了国家大笔的支出。由于严格了汽车编制和使用办法，仅东北大行政区一级机关就减少汽车八十七辆，只汽油每月就可节省二十三亿元东北币。如果将汽车修理费、司机薪资计算在内，将大大超过此数。
    东北整编工作的另一个收获是建立起各种制度，因之使工作效率大大提高起来。如各机关普遍建立了办公制度，克服了以往工作休息不分、公事私事交织的毛病，凡因公接头、谈话，开会、处理日常工作，都一律在办公时间。东北人民政府整编中更建立起集体办公制度，届时主席、各部长都参加，除紧急事件随时解决外，都是在办公时间内处理问题和批阅文件，就商就决就批就办，克服了以往互不接头、处决问题缓慢和公文旅行的毛病，工作效率因而提高三倍。其他如会议制度、报告制度以及文牍处理制度，各地都相继建立起来，大多数机关并将自己的任务、职责、分工等制成“规程”和“办事细则”，使各部门以至每个工作人员进行工作有制度、有章程、有依据，克服和防止了拖延推诿等毛病。现东北人民政府正拟制一系列的制度和条例，如干部奖励条例、惩处贪污失职条例、干部使用升降条例等，以巩固整编的既得成果和经常保持与发挥各级工作人员的积极性创造性，完成艰巨的建设任务。
            确立负责制和工作定额
            干部事业性创造性加强
    建立机关工作的责任制，计时计量的确定每个工作人员的工作定额，是东北整编中另一个重要的成绩。它使每个工作人员的工作效率大大提高，也使整编工作进行得更趋科学合理与彻底。各地在整编中都深入学习了高岗同志《荣誉属于谁》的报告，干部思想大大提高了一步。加强了干部的事业心，工作态度更加认真负责，积极性创造性大大发挥起来，各级机关和大多数干部都详细研究自己部门的工作任务、职责，订出自己的和部门的工作计划和规则、纪律等。有许多地区还采用“标定”办法，实际试验每件工作需要的时间而确定每个人的工作定额和全机关的编制人数。安东市甚至连扫地夫、通讯员的工作，都是先试验每件事需多少时间，而后规定出每人一天的工作任务的。辽东省税务局整编时减少了三十八个人，但工作不仅未受影响，会计科反创造了机关工作新纪录。原因也是由于对每个人规定出一定的工作要求，每人都按计划完成任务，实行了“定额定事制”。由于干部职责明确，建立起科学的工作制度，加强了对各县工作的检查和税收工作领导，使该省今年第一季度税收超过完成任务。热河省银行整编中也是根据工作需要来计算干部人数，结果人员大量减少，每月节省开支二千多“工薪分”。
