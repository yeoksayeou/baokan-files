　　A Model of Uniting the Masses to Improve Production:
    Party Member Shi Deben Achieves Excellent Production Results
    By Our Special Correspondent Zhang Zhimin
    Communist Party members must listen to the opinions of non-Party members and give others the opportunity to speak. If others are right, we should welcome it and learn from them. Even if others are wrong, we should let them finish speaking and then explain it slowly. Communist Party members must never be self-righteous, arrogant, thinking they are good at everything and others are good at nothing. Never shut yourselves in small rooms, boasting and bragging, claiming to be kings and overlords.
              Mao Zedong

  High Technical Skills But Not Arrogant, Consults with the Masses on Everything
    Shi Deben, a forge worker at the Shenyang Automotive General Factory Repair Shop, is 33 years old and a veteran worker with 18 years of experience. He joined the Communist Party last June. Because he is good at uniting and cooperating with non-Party masses, he has repeatedly won victories on the production front and is deeply supported and trusted by the masses. He was named a model Party member by the branch this March.
    There are a total of fifteen workers in the forge team, divided into four groups. Lao Shi is the group leader. Lao Shi's technical skills are excellent, and he is a very outstanding forge worker. But he is not arrogant or complacent at all. He understands that the power of the masses is great. Whenever a production task comes down, he always takes the initiative to gather everyone together to discuss it and humbly consult with the masses for solutions. Last June, their team received the task of making bearings. At first, team leader Lao Bi was unsure because it was a new task and the first time doing it. So he asked Lao Shi, "What should we do? We've never done this before. Can we complete it? I think we have to rely on you!" Lao Shi replied, "Relying on me alone is not enough; we still need to rely on the strength of everyone." During the midday break, he gathered all the workers in the team to discuss it. Because it was the first time doing it, everyone lacked experience, so no conclusion was reached. Lao Shi also had no experience in doing this work. However, he had a strong belief in his mind: "Do a good job in production and be determined to complete the task." When he heard that the machine parts factory was also making bearings, Lao Shi ran to the machine parts factory during the lunch break to learn from them. But the machine parts factory was using electric machinery, while their factory did not have that kind of machinery, only a clumsy tool that produced parts very slowly. Making "rolled steel plate heads" could only produce seventy or eighty pieces a day. "A clumsy tool produces parts slowly. Just relying on brute force will not complete the task. Electric machinery is fast, but we don't have it. What can we do to produce more parts and complete the task?" These questions swirled around in Lao Shi's mind every day and every hour. He thought about it for three nights and came up with a way to modify the corrugated iron rolling machine. He took the design drawings to the team and asked the team leader for his opinion, saying, "Lao Bi, what do you think?" The test results showed that the modified corrugated iron rolling machine was even faster than using electricity. The production of rolled steel plate heads increased from seventy or eighty pieces a day to two hundred pieces, and finally to four hundred pieces a day. As a result, they exceeded the task by fifty percent.
    Last November, the forge team received a new task of making hydraulic presses. The higher authorities required the team to complete it before November 25th (this task did not include Shi Deben's group, as they had other tasks). In terms of the team's specific situation, this task was quite arduous. There was a lot of work, few people, a shortage of tools, and it was the first time doing it, so the workers lacked confidence. In short, all the conditions were insufficient. As a result, team leader Lao Bi was once again at a loss and had to find Lao Shi to discuss it. Lao Shi said, "I think we should have a meeting for everyone to discuss it." Nothing came of the discussion on the first night. The discussion continued the next day, but still, no opinions were put forward. It always came down to these few sentences: "We've never done it before, who knows how many workdays it will take to complete it?" "Let's just start doing it and see how it goes!" In other words, don't discuss it! Just push ahead and do it until whenever. Later, Lao Shi proposed an estimate of three hundred and fifty workdays. At that time, the tongs holder Lao Zhao disagreed and said, "Oh dear! I'm afraid we can't complete it." "Today is already the third. We have to complete it by the twenty-fifth. I think even with overtime, it will be tough!" In the end, Lao Shi explained to everyone responsibly, "Don't worry, just do it. If we can't complete it, I'll find a way to guarantee that you will complete it. You guys do the main big jobs first, and if there are any small jobs left over, if you can't complete them, our group can help you do them." Because Lao Shi had always had prestige among the masses, after he made this guarantee, the workers immediately had confidence and all agreed with his opinion. Lao Shi thought that this was not enough, so he actively researched and modified the swage, which resulted in a two-fold increase in efficiency. Before the modification, only three of the No. 12 parts of the hydraulic press could be made in a day; after the modification, eight could be made in a day. Lao Shi helped everyone in this way with practical actions. With the combined efforts of the team's workers, they completed the task on the 19th without even needing the help of Lao Shi's group. They saved one hundred and sixty-four workdays and one and a half tons of coal, creating a new record.
  Helping the Masses Learn, Caring About the Masses' Lives
    Lao Shi is not only active in his work but also studies hard. His level of education is very low. Through his work, he realized that lacking education causes setbacks, so he was determined to study hard. For example, every day after getting off work, after eating dinner, he studied at home until late at night – around twelve o'clock before going to bed. He was either studying technology, researching and improving tools, or learning literacy. At the beginning of Liberation, it was difficult for him to even write his own name, but now he can write simple letters. He can now calculate work hours and fill out work tickets in his work. He not only takes his own studies very seriously, but he is also good at helping other workers and teaching apprentices. He is technically skilled, and not only does he patiently tell others when they ask, but he also patiently and meticulously helps workers and teaches apprentices at any time, on how to do this work to save labor and materials, and avoid rough work, etc. In terms of material life, he cares about workers and apprentices like his own brothers. Last winter, when it first snowed, the apprentice Xiao Feng didn't wear a cotton coat. When Lao Shi saw this, he took a cotton vest from home the next day and gave it to Xiao Feng to wear. He said to the team leader, "It doesn't matter if we wear a little less, don't let the child get cold." Team leader Lao Bi has a large family, and their life is not very prosperous. After creating a new record, the factory gave a bonus of 150,000 yuan. When Lao Bi went to the market to buy things, he accidentally lost the bonus. Lao Bi was very sad. Lao Shi knew about this and didn't say a word. After getting off work, he sent 200,000 yuan to Lao Bi's home to lend to Lao Bi.
    Because Lao Shi plays a model backbone role everywhere in his work, the workers unanimously requested to give him a commendation. But he didn't want it. He believes that all achievements should be attributed to the collective strength. Last year, at the commendation meeting in November, because the team exceeded the production tasks in June, August, and November, the collective was awarded a third-class merit. At this meeting, the workers unanimously expressed that the main reason for exceeding the task was due to Lao Shi's leading role. But he said, "I just moved my mouth, I didn't do anything. If everyone didn't put in the effort, we wouldn't have been able to exceed the task. It's right for everyone to receive the merit, I shouldn't receive a commendation." Later, after the factory director explained, and based on the achievements of exceeding the task in June and August, he was given a commendation. Therefore, the workers of the forge team often proudly say, "We have Lao Shi in our team, so we don't have to worry about not completing the task!"

　　团结群众改进生产的模范
    党员石德本生产成绩好
    本报特约通讯员  张智民
    共产党员必须倾听党外人士的意见，给别人以说话的机会。别人说得对的，我们应该欢迎，应该向别人学习。别人说得不对，也应该让别人说完，然后慢慢加以解释。共产党员决不可自以为是，盛气凌人，自己是什么都好，别人是什么都不好。决不可把自己关在小屋子里，自吹自擂，称王称霸。
              毛泽东            
  技术高不骄傲  遇事和群众商量
    沈阳汽车总厂修理厂的锻工石德本，今年三十三岁，是十八年工龄的老工人。去年六月参加了共产党。因为他善于和党外群众团结合作，所以在生产战线上连打胜仗，深得群众拥护和信任。今年三月被支部评为模范党员。
    锻工班一共有十五名工友，班下分四个小组。老石是小组长。老石的技术很好，是一个很出色的锻工。但他一点也不骄傲自满。他懂得只有群众的力量才是伟大的。不论那次生产任务下来时，他总是主动地将大伙召集在一起讨论，虚心同群众商量办法。去年六月他们这班接到做轴承的任务。开始班长老毕心里没底，因为这是新任务，初次做，于是问老石说：“怎办呢？这个东西咱在早先也没做过，能完成吗？我看就得靠你啦！”老石回答说：“光靠我一个人还不成，主要还是靠大家的力量。”午间休息时，召集全班工友讨论，因为是初次做，大家都没经验，所以也没得出个结论来。老石对做这活同样也没经验。但是，在他脑子里存在着“搞好生产，决心完成任务”这一坚强信念。当他听到机件厂也做轴承时，在中午休息的时候，老石就跑到机件厂去向人家学习。但机件厂是用电力机械做的，而他们厂没有那种机械，只有一个笨家伙，出活很慢。做“卷钢板头”一天只能做七、八十个。“笨家伙出活慢，光靠使劲，也完不成任务。电力机械快，咱又没有，怎办呢？想啥法才能多出活，完成任务呢？”这些问题，每日每时地在老石脑子里翻来覆去地盘旋着。他想了三个晚上，结果想出了改造卷瓦机的办法。他把设计的图纸拿到班上，征求班长意见说：“老毕，你看怎样？”试验结果，改造后的卷瓦机比用电力还快。做卷钢板头由过去一天出七、八十个，增到二百个，最后一天做到四百个。结果超过任务百分之五十。
    去年十一月锻工班又接到做水压机的新任务。上级要求该班在十一月二十五日前完成（这个任务不包括石德本那一小组，他们另有任务）。就该班具体情况来讲，这个任务是较繁重的。活多、人少、工具不足又是初次做，工人没信心。总之，一切条件均不够。这一来，闹的班长老毕心中又没了主意，只好找老石来商量，老石说：“我看还是开会让大家讨论吧。”头一天晚上没讨论出什么结果。第二天又继续讨论，依然没提出什么意见。总是不外这几句话：“从前没做过，谁知道多少工能完成哪？”“先做着往前赶着看吧！”言外就是别讨论啦！推着做，做到什么时候算什么时候。后来还是老石提出一共定三五○工的意见，当时掌钳老赵不同意地说：“哎呀！恐怕完不成吧。”“今天就三号啦，二十五号就叫完成，我看加班加点也够呛！”最后老石负责地向大家解释：“你们放心，只管做。若是完不成，我想办法保证叫你们完成。你们先做主要的大活，剩下小活，如完不成，我们这组可以帮助你们做。”因为老石素日在群众中有威信，经过他这样保证，工友们立刻都有了信心，都同意了他的意见。老石一想光这样还不够，自己便又积极研究，改造了甩子，结果提高效率二倍多。没改前一天做水压机十二号零件只做三个，改后，一天达到八个。老石就这样以实际行动来帮助大家，加上该班工友们共同加油，结果也没用老石那小组工友帮忙，十九日就全部完成了任务。节省了一百六十四个工、一吨半煤炭，创造了新纪录。
  帮助群众学习  关心群众生活
    老石不但工作积极，并且努力学习，他的文化很低。在工作中他体会到没有文化碰钉子，便下决心努力学习。如他每天下班吃过晚饭后，在家学习一直到深夜——十二点左右才睡觉。不是学习技术，研究改进工具，就是学习文化。解放之初，他写自己的名字都很难，现在已能写简单书信了，在工作中已能算工时填工票。他不仅本人学习很认真，更善于帮助其他工友和教徒工。他技术高，不但别人来问，他耐心告诉，并且随时耐心细致地帮助工友和教给徒弟，这个活怎样做才能省工省料，不毛皮等。在物质生活上，他也像关心自己亲弟兄一样关心工友徒弟。徒工小冯，去冬初下雪时没穿上棉袄，老石见到了第二天就从家拿个棉背心来给小冯穿。他和班长说：“咱们少穿点不要紧，别把孩子冻坏了。”班长老毕家里人口很多，生活不够充裕。创造新纪录，厂子发给十五万元奖金，去市场买东西时，老毕不慎把奖金遗失了。老毕心里很难过。老石知道后，他一声没响，下班后送二十万元到老毕家借给老毕。
    由于老石在工作中处处起了模范骨干作用，所以工友们一致要求给他记功。但是他却不要。他认为一切成绩应当归功于集体力量。去年在十一月评功会上，因为该班在六、八、十一月都超过了生产任务，所以集体立了三等功。在这个会上，工友们一致表示所以能超过任务，主要应归功于老石的带头作用。他却说：“我就是动动嘴吧，也没做啥，大家要是不出力气，是超过不了任务的。还是大伙立功对，我不应当记功。”后来经过厂长解说，又根据六、八月超过任务的成绩，给他记了功。所以锻工班的工友们常常自傲地说：“我们这班有个老石，任务算不愁完不成啦！”
