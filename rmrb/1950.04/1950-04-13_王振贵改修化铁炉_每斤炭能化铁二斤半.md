　　Wang Zhengui Modifies Iron Smelting Furnace
    Every Pound of Coal Can Melt Two and a Half Pounds of Iron
    [Our Newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily News on April 6th: Wang Zhengui, a worker in the casting group of the Repair Shop of the Datong Mining Bureau, modified the air inlet of the iron smelting furnace from direct blowing to inclined blowing, greatly improving production efficiency. In the past, the furnace produced iron once every seven days, with one pound of coal melting one pound of iron, and the products had many sand holes, with rejects accounting for about 4%. After this modification of the air inlet, iron can be produced once every five days, the amount of iron melted per pound of coal increased to two and a half pounds, sand holes have been greatly reduced, and rejects are now less than 2%. Wang Zhengui is continuing his research, striving to reach a record of three pounds of iron melted per pound of coal.

　　王振贵改修化铁炉
    每斤炭能化铁二斤半
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报四月六日消息：大同矿务局修械厂铸工组工友王振贵，将化铁炉风口由对吹改修为斜吹，生产效果大为提高。该炉过去七天出铁一次，每斤炭化铁一斤，且产品砂眼很多，废品约占百分之四。经此次改修风口后，每五天即可出一次铁，每斤炭化铁增为二斤半，砂眼已大大减少，废品已不到百分之二。现王振贵仍在继续研究，争取每斤炭达到化铁三斤的纪录。
