Responding to the Call for 500 Kilometers Per Locomotive Per Day
Locomotive No. 1928 Achieves Initial Success
Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Holds Celebration Rally

[Our Newspaper Dispatches] Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot actively responded to the Tianjin Railway Bureau's call for the "500-kilometer Red Flag Locomotive" campaign. On April 7th, Locomotive No. 1928 traveled 530.9 kilometers in 21 hours and 52 minutes, setting a new daily kilometer record for the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. Since the Tianjin Railway Bureau issued the "Provisional Measures for the 500-kilometer Red Flag Locomotive Campaign," the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot has organized its crew members to discuss and study them, and has formulated specific implementation methods in light of the depot's actual conditions, thereby enhancing the confidence and enthusiasm of the crew members. On April 7th, under the leadership of driver Song Ruzhang, Locomotive No. 1928 hauled Train No. 762 from Datong at 0:27 AM, arriving in Zhangjiakou at 7:54 AM. It entered the depot at 8:00 AM. With the assistance of the joint labor team in the depot, the depot time was reduced to 20 minutes. At 9:05 AM, it continued hauling Train No. 762 to Kangzhuang, arriving in Kangzhuang at 12:24 PM. It then hauled Train No. 761 from Kangzhuang at 1:10 PM, returning to Zhangjiakou at 5:29 PM. After entering the depot and turning around, it left the depot at 6:10 PM and hauled Train No. 752 from Zhangjiakou to Kangzhuang at 6:32 PM, arriving safely in Kangzhuang at 10:19 PM that day, totaling 530.9 kilometers traveled in 21 hours and 52 minutes. Furthermore, it saved 1,560 kilograms of coal compared to the usual daily locomotive kilometer consumption. This achievement was obtained through the joint efforts of the crew, the joint labor team in the depot, and the maintenance workers. To celebrate this victory, the locomotive depot held a grand celebration rally on April 10th, awarding two banners to the crew of Locomotive No. 1928.

　　响应日车五百公里号召
    一九二八号首获成功
    张家口机务段举行庆祝大会
    【本报讯】张家口机务段积极响应天津铁路局五百公里红旗机车运动的号召，一九二八号机车于四月七日以二十一点五十二分钟走行五三○·九公里，创造了京绥路日车公里的新纪录。自天津铁路局布置五百公里红旗机车运动暂行办法后，张家口机务段即组织乘务员讨论研究，并结合段内实际情况，作出具体贯彻的办法，因此提高了乘务员的信心与热情。一九二八号机车在司机长宋汝璋的领导下，于四月七日零点二十七分由大同牵引七六二次列车，于七点五十四分到张家口，八点入库，在段内联合劳动组协助下，库存时间缩短为二十分钟；于九点零五分继续牵引七六二次去康庄，十二点二十四分抵康庄后，复于十三点十分由康庄牵引七六一次，于十七点二十九分返回张家口，入库转头后十八点十分出库，十八点三十二分又由张家口牵引七五二次去康庄，于当日二十二点十九分安抵康庄，总计在二十一点五十二分内走行了五三○·九公里。且较平常行驶日车公里节省煤一、五六○公斤。这个成绩是由于该包乘组及段内联合劳动组、检修工友等共同努力下获得的。为庆祝这一胜利，机务段于四月十日举行盛大庆祝会，授给一九二八号机车包乘组奖旗两面。
