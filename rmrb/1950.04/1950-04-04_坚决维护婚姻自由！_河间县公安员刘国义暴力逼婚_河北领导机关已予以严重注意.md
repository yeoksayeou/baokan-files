　　Resolutely Safeguard Freedom of Marriage!
    Hejian County Public Security Officer Liu Guoyi Forcibly Arranges Marriage Through Violence.
    Leading Organs in Hebei Province Have Paid Serious Attention
To the Editor:
    Liu Guoyi (a member of the Chinese Communist Party), a staff member of the Public Security Bureau of Hejian County, Hebei Province, taking advantage of his work in Longhuadian in January 27th of this year, asked Zhang Ruixiang, a public security officer in the village, and other village cadres to introduce Li Xiuying, the daughter of Wang Guixiang in the village, as his wife. Li Xiuying, having been educated by the People's Government, knew that marriage should be independent and voluntary, otherwise it would be a lifelong pain for women, and she refused very simply. However, fearing that Liu Guoyi and others would come to make trouble at her home, she hid at her maternal grandmother's home in Wu'ertou Village on February 18th (the second day of the first lunar month). Subsequently, Liu Guoyi repeatedly instigated Zhang Ruixiang, branch secretary Du Yuchuan, deputy village head Liu Jinfu and other village cadres to propose marriage to Li Xiuying's mother and uncle Li Shuzhang, and shamelessly threatened Li Shuzhang. Li Shuzhang was frightened and called Li Xiuying back on February 22nd. The next night, Zhang Ruixiang and the other three village cadres were again sent by Liu Guoyi to propose marriage, threatening and luring her to agree. Li Xiuying firmly said, "I will make my own decision about my marriage. I would rather die than marry him. If my uncle agrees, let my uncle marry him."
    Seeing that his marriage proposal had failed repeatedly, Liu Guoyi disregarded his identity as a staff member of the People's Government and the noble qualities that a Communist Party member should have, and resorted to hooligan tactics. He wanted to arrest Li Shuzhang and force him to arrange the marriage for his niece. Li Shuzhang, hearing the news, was frightened and ran away. On the night of March 4th, Liu Guoyi arbitrarily sent six or seven public security team members to arrest Li Xiuying's mother at his residence, falsely accusing her of letting Li Shuzhang go and ordering her to hand him over within three days. Li Xiuying's mother was so frightened that she pleaded with her daughter, saying, "Just agree! We can't afford to offend them!" But Li Xiuying's will was firm, and she never agreed. The mother and daughter discussed Li Xiuying hiding at her aunt's house in Shanglin, and her mother hiding at her mother's home in Wu'ertou. On the night of March 5th, Liu Guoyi again arbitrarily sent Yu Daqiu, the militia company commander, to lead eleven militiamen to drag Li Xiuying's mother out of bed in Wu'ertou, immediately tied her up to Longhuadian, set up a private court, and ordered public security team members Yang Mang, Li Tanglin, and others to torture Li Xiuying's mother. After Liu Guoyi learned the whereabouts of Li Shuzhang from Li Xiuying's mother, he sent Yu Daqiu with the militiamen to arrest Li Shuzhang, and shamelessly threatened and lured the two of them. Li Shuzhang, seeing that his sister-in-law had been beaten into paralysis, was frightened and promised to find his niece.
    While Li Xiuying's mother and uncle were being illegally arrested and beaten by Liu Guoyi, Li Xiuying immediately ran to the Hejian People's Court to file a complaint. When Li Shuzhang went to Shanglin to find his niece to return, Li Xiuying also returned from the court. Uncle and niece met on the road and cried bitterly. Li Shuzhang felt that the matter was difficult to resolve and wanted to commit suicide, saying painfully to Xiuying, "I'll just die, Comrade Liu can't see you, and I can't bear to go back!" Just then, the court sent someone to examine the injuries and investigate the situation. In addition to the bowl-sized injuries on the lower body, buttocks, and thighs of Li Xiuying's mother, other circumstances were also clarified, and Liu Guoyi was arrested and brought to justice. The Hejian County People's Government decided to remove Liu Guoyi from his post and investigate his case. The Hejian County People's Court sentenced the offender to six months in prison. The Hejian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to give Liu Guoyi a punishment of probation within the Party.
    After the Hebei Daily exposed the incident on March 25th, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that Liu Guoyi had completely lost the basic conditions of a Communist Party member and immediately instructed the Cangxian Prefectural Committee to propose the expulsion of Liu Guoyi from the Party. The Hebei Provincial Women's Federation also believes that the sentence imposed by the Hejian County People's Court is too light and has requested the Provincial People's Court to re-sentence him; the Provincial People's Court has also put forward its opinion that the sentence imposed by the Hejian County People's Court is inappropriate and should be re-handled.

　　坚决维护婚姻自由！
    河间县公安员刘国义暴力逼婚 
    河北领导机关已予以严重注意编辑同志：
    河北省河间县公安局股员刘国义（中共党员），今年一月二十七日，借到龙华店工作的机会，托该村公安员张瑞祥等村干部，介绍该村王桂香的闺女李秀英为妻。李秀英因受过人民政府的教育，知道婚姻应该自主自愿，不然就是妇女终身痛苦，便很干脆的拒绝了。但她又怕在家被刘国义等来找麻烦，便在二月十八日（旧历正月初二）躲到务尔头村姥姥家去。随后刘国义又三番两次唆使张瑞祥、支部书记杜玉川、副村长刘金福等村干，向李秀英的母亲和叔叔李树章提亲，并无耻的威胁李树章。李树章害怕了，便在二月二十二日把李秀英叫回来。第二天晚上，张瑞祥等三个村干又被刘国义使去提亲，威胁利诱地要她答应。李秀英坚决的说：“我的婚姻我作主，我宁可死了也不嫁他，我叔答应了让我叔嫁他。”
    刘国义见三番五次提亲不成，就不顾自己是人民政府的工作人员的身份和共产党员应有的高尚品质，耍开了流氓无赖手段。他要想把李树章抓起来，强迫给他侄女作主成亲，李树章听到消息，吓的跑了。刘国义就在三月四日半夜，擅自派了六七个公安队员，把李秀英的母亲抓到他的住处，诬赖她放走了李树章，限令三天内把人交出。李秀英的母亲吓的向女儿哀求说：“你答应了吧！咱惹不起人家！”但李秀英意志坚决，始终不同意，母女并商量着李秀英躲到商林姑姑家去，她母亲躲到务尔头娘家去。刘国义在三月五日晚上，又擅自派了民兵中队长于大秋带领十一个民兵，到务尔头从被窝里抓出李秀英的母亲，立时捆到龙华店，私立公堂，令公安队员杨忙、李堂林等三人拷打李秀英的母亲。刘国义从李秀英的母亲口中问得李树章的去处后，就派于大秋带着民兵把李树章抓到了，厚颜无耻地对她们两人威胁利诱，李树章见嫂子被打瘫了，就吓的应承去找侄女。
    正当李秀英的母亲和叔叔被刘国义非法捕打的时候，李秀英便马上跑到河间人民法院去控告。当李树章到商林找侄女往回返时，李秀英也从法院返回，叔叔侄女路上相遇，痛哭不已。李树章感到事情难解脱，要寻短见，痛心的对秀英说：“我死了就算了，刘同志见不着你，我回去也是受不了！”恰好这时法院派人前来验伤，调查情况。除李秀英母亲下身臀部大腿根底下均有碗口大的伤迹外，其他情况也一一弄清，遂将刘国义逮捕法办。河间县人民政府决定将刘国义撤职查办。河间县人民法院判处该犯有期徒刑半年。中共河间县委决定予刘国义以留党察看处分。
    在三月二十五日河北日报揭发了这件事以后，中共河北省委纪律委员会认为刘国义完全失去共产党员的起码条件，立即指示沧县地委，提议开除刘国义党籍。河北省妇联也认为河间县人民法院判处太轻，已向省人民法院要求重新判处；省人民法院亦已提出意见，认为河间县人民法院的判处是不妥当的，应该重新处理。
