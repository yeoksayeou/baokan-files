　　Turning Dead Capital into Liquid Assets
    Hebei Province Enterprises Inventory Warehouses
    Initially Clearing Surplus Materials Worth Over 700,000 Jin of Rice

    [Our Newspaper] Hebei provincial enterprises and mines, in conjunction with last year's closing of accounts, conducted warehouse inspections and found that waste phenomena such as discrepancies between accounts and inventory and shortages of materials were very serious. The factories and mines are now conducting further in-depth inspections. The Provincial Industrial Company and the Mining Bureau convened a special accounting meeting in January for the directly subordinate factories and mines to close accounts and clear warehouses. Over the past two months, with the leadership of factory directors and the support of all employees, many problems have been discovered during the inventory work. For example, the Xinji Chemical Plant found a shortage of 1 million jin of coal during this inventory, the Gaoyang Dyeing and Rolling Mill had an excess of more than 3,500 jin of colors, and the Handan Flour Mill had a shortage of 150,000 jin of wheat and more than 200,000 jin of coal. Other factories and mines have also found shortages or surplus materials. Some factories have accounts but no materials, while others have materials but no accounts. The amount of goods in the warehouse is uncertain. Even some urgently needed materials that could not be bought anywhere were found to be in large quantities in their own warehouses after inventory, such as the foreign pig iron stored in the Linqing Iron Factory, which is enough for six years.
    According to the preliminary inventory results of the factories under the Industrial Company, the total surplus materials are equivalent to 739,347 jin of rice, and the total shortage of materials is equivalent to 506,629 jin of rice. However, in fact, this inspection is still not thorough, especially as some factory and mine leaders have not paid enough attention to this issue and have adopted a perfunctory attitude, quickly ending this work in a blitz. For example, several coal mines spent only three days slightly cleaning up and then ended the work, reporting to the higher authorities that "There are no major problems here." Due to this hasty thinking, they could not further discover problems.
    Based on the above situation and the general spirit of the State Council's decision on unified financial and economic work, the Provincial Department of Industry convened a special meeting on March 27 for managers, factory directors, trade union chairmen, and cost accountants of provincial factories and mines to arrange warehouse cleanup work. It also formulated unified material allocation methods, promulgated economic disciplines, and established an independent and responsible warehouse system. The Department of Industry established a Material Cleanup and Allocation Committee, with two cleanup teams attached, to go to the factories and mines in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner to supervise, guide, and assist in the cleanup work, with a deadline for completion. The meeting also emphasized that factory directors and managers should take the lead, personally take action, and rely on the broad masses of workers to complete this task. It was especially pointed out that the factory and mine cleanup committee must absorb veteran workers to participate. This cleanup should achieve consistency between accounts and inventory, clear accumulated raw materials and waste products, turn dead capital into liquid assets, and resolve all outstanding cases.

　　变死财为活财
    河北省营各厂清查仓库
    初次清出多余物资折米七十余万斤
    【本报讯】河北省营厂矿结合去年结账进行仓库检查，发现账库不符、物资短少等浪费现象甚为严重，现各该厂矿正进一步深入检查。该省实业公司、矿务局曾于一月专门召集了各直属厂矿的会计会议进行结账及清理仓库，两月来各厂矿在厂长带头及全体职工支持下，在清查工作中发现不少问题。如辛集化学厂在此次清理中查出短煤一百万斤，高阳染轧厂多出三千五百多斤颜色，邯郸面粉厂短少十五万斤小麦，二十多万斤煤。其他各厂矿也同样发现短少或多余物资；有的厂有账没有物资，有的厂则有东西没有账，仓库东西没准数。甚至有些迫切需要的物资，各处买不到，经清查后发现自己仓库还存着很多，如临清铁工厂存的洋生铁就够六年之用。
    根据实业公司所属各工厂初步清查结果，计多余物资共折米七三九、三四七斤，短少物资共折米五○六、六二九斤。但实际上此次检查仍不彻底，特别有些厂矿领导上对这一问题尚未十分重视，采取了草从事的态度，以突击方式很快结束了这个工作。如有几个煤矿只用了三天时间稍事清理，即行结束，向上级报告时还说：“我们这里没有大问题。”由于这种轻率了草的思想，所以也就不能进一步发现问题。
    省工业厅根据以上情况及中央人民政府政务院统一财经工作决定的总精神，于三月二十七日又召集省营厂矿经理、厂长、工会主任及成本会计的专门会议，布置仓库清理工作。并制定了统一调拨物资办法，颁布经济纪律，建立独立专责的仓库制度；并由工业厅成立物资清理调配委员会，附设两个清理小组，有计划、有步骤、有重点地分赴各厂矿督促、指导、协助清理工作，限期完成。会上并着重强调厂长、经理带头，亲自动手，依靠广大工人群众来完成这一任务。特别指出厂矿清委会一定要吸收老工人参加。此次清理要做到账库相符，清理积压原料废品，变死财为活财，解决一切悬案。
