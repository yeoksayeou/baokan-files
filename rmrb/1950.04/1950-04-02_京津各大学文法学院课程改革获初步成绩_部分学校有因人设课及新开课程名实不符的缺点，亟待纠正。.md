　　Preliminary Achievements in Curriculum Reform in Arts and Sciences Departments of Beijing and Tianjin Universities
    Some Schools Have Shortcomings Such as Offering Courses Based on Individual Faculty and New Courses Not Matching Their Names, Which Urgently Need Correction.
    Newly Opened Marxist-Leninist Courses Are Warmly Welcomed by Students
    Preliminary Experiences in Solving the Difficulty of Teachers for New Courses:
    Professors Collectively Prepare and Lecture, and Do a Good Job in Political Study for Teachers and Students
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Reporter Jin Feng reports: The curriculum of various departments in the Arts and Sciences faculties of universities in Beijing and Tianjin, since the reform based on the interim regulations issued by the former North China Higher Education Committee, has generally improved and gained some experience in overcoming the difficulties of teachers. However, some biases have also emerged in the process, such as some schools setting up "courses" based on "individuals," and the courses offered not matching their names, which urgently need further solutions.
    Curriculum reform is the primary link in today's transformation of old universities. As early as before the summer vacation last year, the former North China Higher Education Committee organized some professors and off-campus experts from the Arts and Sciences faculties of universities in Beijing and Tianjin to repeatedly study and discuss the curricula of seven departments in the Arts and Sciences faculties, including philosophy, history, education, economics, political science, law, and literature, and drafted regulations on the public compulsory courses, teaching guidelines, and basic courses for each department. In October of last year, the former North China Higher Education Committee issued the "Interim Regulations on Curriculum Reform for Various Departments of Arts and Sciences Faculties in Universities and Colleges in North China" based on this. Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, Yanjing University and other universities in Beijing and Tianjin have tried their best to abide by these regulations, abolished various reactionary and outdated courses, and opened new courses based on Marxism-Leninism. According to preliminary statistics, the total number of courses discontinued and newly opened in the Arts and Sciences faculties of the above four universities exceeds one hundred. For example, the Arts and Sciences faculty of Peking University discontinued 45 courses and opened 77 new courses. Each department in each school discontinued and newly opened courses ranging from several to more than ten. The newly opened courses are welcomed by the majority of students. Courses such as the History of Marxist-Leninist Philosophy and the Study of Mao Zedong Thought Methodology in the Philosophy Department of Peking University, and the Marxist-Leninist Legal Theory course in the Law Department of Peking University, are particularly popular among students.
    However, because curriculum reform is a long-term, complex, and meticulous task, a large number of Marxist-Leninist scholars are needed to actually implement the curriculum reform plan. At the current stage, when carrying out curriculum reform, schools generally face the difficulty of a lack of teachers and being unable to offer new courses. For example, basic courses such as World Literature History in the Chinese and Foreign Language Departments of Peking University and Tsinghua University, Chinese Revolution History, Chinese Revolution Problems, Modern World Revolution History in the Political Science Department, and Modern Chinese Economic History, Economic Construction of New Democracy, and Economic Geography in the Economics Department, cannot be offered due to the lack of appropriate professors to teach them.
    After half a year of exploration, individual schools have created some methods to overcome these difficulties and gained preliminary experience in carrying out curriculum reform. One method is collective lecturing: for example, the basic course Introduction to Political Science (explaining the Marxist-Leninist theories of class, state, and nation) offered by the Political Science Department of Peking University is collectively taught by four professors in the department. They first divide the content of the course into several stages, and then each person is specifically responsible for lecturing on one part, but they also prepare other parts at the same time. Before each class, the four people jointly discuss the content to be lectured on, collect students' feedback after class, and then collectively discuss improvements. Another method is to establish a teaching discussion group for specific courses, prepare lessons collectively, and one person gives the main lecture. For example, courses such as the History of Chinese Philosophy, History of Western Philosophy, and Logic in the Philosophy Department of Peking University are composed of a teaching discussion group consisting of professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, with the lecturing professor as the convener, and meetings are held every two weeks. In advance, the convener (i.e., the main lecturer) prints out the lecture outline for the next two weeks and sends it to each member of the group. During the meeting, each person puts forward opinions on various aspects of the teaching material content, teaching position, viewpoints, and methods that the main lecturer is going to talk about, and makes corrections and supplements. When students hold discussion meetings, professors participate in answering questions and promptly understand the teaching effect and learning enthusiasm. Another method is to invite responsible cadres from relevant agencies to give lectures at the school: for example, the local administration part of the policy and regulations course offered by the Political Science Department of Peking University last year was given by responsible cadres from the Beijing Municipal People's Government in rotation, and the effect was very good.
    According to the situation of curriculum reform carried out by Peking University and Tsinghua University, the preliminary experience gained is: (1) Reducing the number of old compulsory and elective courses in each department carrying out curriculum reform, and concentrating on doing a good job in several basic courses through collective lecturing or collective lesson preparation will enable the curriculum reform to achieve better results; (2) The basic guarantee for implementing curriculum reform is for teachers and students in the Arts and Sciences faculties to study political courses well and create favorable conditions for curriculum reform.
    The above methods are still in the exploratory stage, and only individual schools and individual classes have learned better. The curriculum reform of most schools in the Arts and Sciences faculties is still in a state of deadlock. Therefore, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has recently invited some professors from the Arts and Sciences faculties of Peking University and Tsinghua University and off-campus experts to hold a forum, and restored the work of the curriculum reform research group for the seven departments of the Arts and Sciences faculties plus the Department of Sociology, which was organized last year. Currently, each group is discussing, researching, and further modifying and enriching the interim regulations based on the actual implementation of curriculum reform in various schools over the past six months, in order to formulate detailed plans for curriculum reform in each department.
    In addition, some of the newly opened courses, such as Selected Readings of Special Books in the Chinese Department of Nankai University (content is Zhou Bangyan's Pian Yu Ci), Ancient Prose in the Chinese Department of Yanjing University (content is Han Shi Wai Zhuan, Tang and Song Legends, Liao Zhai Zhi Yi), Bu Ci Research in the Chinese Department of Tsinghua University, Examples of Chinese Art in the Philosophy Department, German Feuerbach Theory in the Philosophy Department of Peking University (Chinese Feuerbach Theory is opened at the same time), etc., show the situation of setting up "courses" based on "individuals"; and another example is the Literary Theory course opened by the Department of Western Languages ​​of Peking University, which claims to "elucidate the entire organic figure composed of British and American literary theories," but in reality it is still talking about British and American bourgeois literary theories, which does not match the listed name. These phenomena of setting up "courses" based on "individuals" and the courses offered not matching their names have attracted the attention of the Ministry of Education, which is organizing each department of the Arts and Sciences faculties of each school to conduct a summary and inspection.

　　京津各大学文法学院课程改革获初步成绩
    部分学校有因人设课及新开课程名实不符的缺点，亟待纠正。
    新开马列主义课程备受同学热烈欢迎
    解决新课师资困难的初步经验：
    教授集体备课讲课搞好师生政治学习
    【本报讯】记者金凤报道：京津各大学文法学院各系课程，兹根据前华北高等教育委员会所颁发的暂行规定进行改革以来，一般已有改进，并且获得一些克服师资困难的经验。但在进行过程中，也产生了若干偏向，如某些学校因“人”设“课”，所开课程名实不符等，急需进一步求得解决。
    课程改革为今日改造旧大学的首要环节，早在去年暑假前，前华北高等教育委员会就组织京津各大学文法学院一部分教授及校外专家，反复研究讨论文法学院中哲学、历史、教育、经济、政治、法律、文学等七系的课程，拟出了文法学院公共必修课程、各系教学方针及基本课程的条例。去年十月，前华北高教会据此颁发《华北各大学专科学校文法学院各系课程改革暂行规定》。京津北大、清华、南开、燕京等大学都尽量遵照这一规定，废除了多种反动的、陈腐的课程，新开了以马列主义为原则的课程。据初步统计，以上四校文法学院停开与新开的课程，总计都在一百门以上。如北大文法学院停开课程达四十五门，新开课程达七十七门。各校每一系停开与新开课程，则自数门至十数门不等。新开课程为广大同学所欢迎。像北大哲学系的马列主义哲学史，毛泽东思想方法研究，北大法律系的马列主义法律理论等课程，尤为同学们热烈爱好。
    但由于课程改革是长期的、复杂的、细致的工作，课改方案提出以后，需要大批马列主义学者来实际执行。而在目前阶段，各校进行课程改革时，则普遍存在着师资缺乏，开不出新课的困难情况。如北大、清华中、外文系基本课程世界文学史，政治系基本课程中国革命史、中国革命问题、近代世界革命史、经济系基本课程中国近代经济史、新民主主义的经济建设、经济地理等，都因缺乏适当教授担任而开不出来。
    经过半年来的摸索，个别学校已经创造出一些克服此等困难的办法及进行课程改革的初步经验。一种办法是集体讲学：如北大政治系所开基本课程政治学概论（讲述马列主义的阶级论、国家论及民族论等），即由该系四位教授集体讲授。他们先将该课程内容划分为几个阶段，然后各人专门负责主讲一部分，但又同时准备其他部分。每次上课前，四人共同讨论所讲内容，课后搜集同学的反映，再集体讨论改进。一种办法是成立专门课程的教学讨论会，集体备课，一人主讲。如北大哲学系的中国哲学史、西洋哲学史、逻辑等课程均由教授、讲助教组成教学讨论会，以讲课教授为召集人，每两星期开会讨论一次。事先召集人（即主讲人）就印好下两个星期的讲学提纲，送发小组各个成员。开会时各人就主讲人所要讲的教材内容、教学的立场、观点、方法等各方面提出意见，修正补充。学生举行讨论会时，教授参加解答问题，并及时了解教学效果及学习情绪。再一种办法是邀请有关机关负责干部来校讲学：如北大政治系去年所开政策法令课程中的地方行政部分，即由北京市人民政府各负责干部轮流来校讲学，效果甚好。
    根据北大、清华两校进行课程改革的情形，所得出的初步经验是：（一）进行课程改革的各系减少旧有的必修课与选修课科目，集中精力以集体讲授或集体备课的方式，搞好几门基本课程，将使课程改革收得较好的效果；（二）文法学院师生学好政治课，为课改创造有利条件，是贯彻课程改革的基本保证之一。
    以上这些办法还在摸索阶段，只有个别学校个别班系学得较好。大多数学校文法学院的课程改革还呈现胶着状态。因此，最近中央人民政府教育部已邀请北大、清华文法学院一部分教授及校外专家举行座谈，恢复了去年组织的文法学院七系加社会系共八系的课程改革研究小组的工作。现各组正根据半年来各校实际执行课改的情况，讨论研究、进一步修改充实暂行规定，以便拟订各系课程改革的详细方案。
    此外，有一部分新开课程，如南开中文系的专书选读（内容为周邦彦的片玉词），燕京中文系的古文（内容为韩诗外传、唐宋传奇、聊斋志异），清华中文系的卜辞研究，哲学系的中国美术品举例，北大哲学系的德文费尔巴哈论（同时开中文费尔巴哈论）等，显出因“人”设“课”的情形；又如北大西语系所开文艺学，说是“阐明英美文艺理论所构成的整个有机体的图形”，实则仍是讲述英美资产文艺理论，与所列名称不相符合。此等因“人”设“课”及所开课程名实不符的现象，已引起教育部注意，正组织各校文法学院各系进行总结检查中。
