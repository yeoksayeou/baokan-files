The Road for Private Silver and Money Businesses

　　(1) The Old Road of Speculation and Profiteering is Impassable

The law of capitalist development is from industrial capital to banking capital, and finally banking capital in turn controls industry, becoming finance capital in the age of imperialism. Pre-liberation old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Industry was not developed, especially during the Anti-Japanese War when production shrank, but the number of banks and money shops continued to increase. For example, in 1936, there were 76 private banks and money shops in Shanghai, which increased to 210 in 1949, a two-fold increase in thirteen years. This is an abnormal phenomenon.

Why did private banks and money shops increase after the Anti-Japanese War, and how did they operate? Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, inflation, soaring prices, and currency depreciation led banks and money shops to engage in speculation and profiteering in order to obtain exorbitant profits. For example, hoarding goods, speculating in gold and foreign currency, and lending at usurious rates. Very little capital was used to support production. In order to escape inspection by the Kuomintang government, they established one, two, or even three sets of back-books in addition to the front-books. The funds used in the back-books accounted for more than 80 percent, while the front-books only accounted for 10 to 20 percent. According to statistics, before the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, private banks and money shops numbered more than 200, but only 1.7 to 3.4 percent of the funds were used to support production. This kind of speculation and profiteering is impossible in a new democratic society and will be severely banned by the People's Government.

　　(2) The People's Government's Policy on Private Silver and Money Businesses

Article 39 of the Common Program stipulates that "Financial undertakings shall be subject to strict state control." "Private financial undertakings operating lawfully shall be subject to the supervision and guidance of the state. Those who engage in financial speculation and undermine the state's financial undertakings shall be severely punished." This is the basic policy of the People's Government towards private silver and money businesses.

After the liberation of cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, and Xi'an, the local People's Governments promulgated "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Silver and Money Businesses." These measures clearly stipulate which legitimate businesses banks and money shops can operate and which illegal businesses are prohibited, with penalties for violations. For example, Article 4 of the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Silver and Money Businesses in the North China Region, promulgated by the former North China People's Government on April 27, 1949, stipulates: "Private silver and money businesses are limited to operating the following businesses: 1. Accepting various deposits; 2. Handling various loans and bill discounts; 3. Remittances and documentary bills within the Liberated Areas; 4. Foreign exchange outside the region and abroad with the special permission of the People's Bank of China; 5. Bill acceptance; 6. Acting as an agent for receiving and paying items; 7. Investment in industry and mining; 8. Safekeeping of valuables."

Article 6 further stipulates: "The financial operations of silver and money businesses must not have the following behaviors: 1. Being a shareholder of public or private firms or other silver and money businesses (except for investment in industry and mining); 2. Buying or accepting the stocks of this bank or money shop; 3. Purchasing real estate not necessary for business operations; 4. Concurrently engaging in commerce and hoarding goods, or buying and selling on behalf of customers; 5. Establishing subsidiary books or making inaccurate records; 6. Issuing promissory notes; 7. Accepting deposits from all military and political groups, agencies, and state-owned enterprises; 8. Buying and selling gold, silver, and foreign currencies for mortgage loans; 9. Appearing on behalf of others to possess property; 10. Other behaviors not approved." These provisions are in line with the spirit of the Common Program.

In short, the People's Government's policy towards private silver and money businesses is two-fold. The government allows the existence of all private banks and money shops that operate legitimately and provides guidance and assistance to lead them to the road of supporting production. On the other hand, those who engage in speculation, profiteering, and illegal operations, and do not comply with government laws, will be subject to strict inspection and management, and will be given warnings, fines, orders to replace important staff, suspension of check clearing, and suspension of business depending on the severity of the circumstances.

　　(3) Supporting Production or Continuing Speculation and Profiteering?

According to materials from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places, there are two basic trends in private silver and money businesses after liberation:

First, some banks and money shops abide by government laws and, under the organization, guidance, and assistance of the National Bank, are moving towards the road of supporting production, resulting in thriving business and considerable profits. There are two forms of private banks and money shops investing in production: one is collective, such as organizing banking syndicates or joint lending offices; the other is individual.

In order to guide idle funds to production and assist private yarn factories in solving the problem of purchasing raw cotton, the Shanghai People's Bank organized the Shanghai Private Silver, Money, and Trust Industry Joint Lending Office on September 23 last year. A total of 127 banks, money shops, and trust companies participated, with a capital of 4 billion (a total of 800 units, each unit of 5 million yuan). The loan target was the joint cotton purchase office organized by the Shanghai cotton yarn industry. The interest was calculated at 80 to 90 percent of the highest interest rate of the Shanghai financial industry interest rate committee, with interest settled every half month and a term of two months. In order to solve the problem of capital turnover difficulties that occurred after private banks and money shops invested in production, the People's Bank specially formulated interbank lending measures: (1) When the money market is tight, deposits decrease, and loans cannot be recovered in time, resulting in insufficient cash reserves, interbank day lending may be handled with the consent of the People's Bank to facilitate adjustment; (2) The lending rate shall not be lower than the loan rate; (3) A maximum of three borrowings per month, each of which may be rolled over for three consecutive days; (4) The amount of borrowing shall be limited to 70 percent of the actual total loan amount. In order to strengthen the leadership and support for the Joint Lending Office and enable it to play a greater role in the economic construction of new China, after the loan period of the Shanghai Private Silver, Money, and Trust Industry Joint Lending Office to the Cotton Textile Industry Joint Purchase Office expired, the Public-Private Financial Industry Joint Lending Office was reorganized on December 17 under the leadership of the People's Bank. More than 150 public and private banks and money shops participated (out of 178 private banks and money shops in Shanghai, almost all participated except for a dozen that were suspended), with a capital of 12 billion yuan; the State Banks (People's Bank, Bank of Communications) 2 billion yuan. The joint organization of lending offices by state-owned banks and private banks and money shops is a further development of private banking syndicates. It has the following characteristics:

1. There are clear regulations on the loan targets and uses: A. The scope of loans is relatively wide, not limited to a certain industry. All production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood can apply for loans. B. The loan targets are limited to those who can continue production and have development prospects. C. The use of loans is limited to purchasing raw materials and increasing production, and must not be used to repay debts. D. Make key loans, not ordinary loans. E. Loan targets must choose those with reliable credit and sufficient guarantees, and must invite solid manufacturers as guarantors and have practical repayment plans.

2. The leadership of the People's Bank is combined with democratic management. Fifteen representatives are elected from all bank and money shop representatives participating in the Joint Lending Office to form a joint lending office committee, which is responsible for handling loan review, collection and payment, liquidation of the lending office's accounts, and liaison between public and private banks and money shops. Among all the committee members, six standing committee members are elected to form a standing committee. In order to collectively review loans, the committee and the standing committee are tentatively scheduled to meet once a week. Loans of more than 300 million yuan shall be approved by the committee. Those below 300 million yuan shall be approved by the Standing Committee and ratified by the committee. The representative of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China is the ex officio chairman of the committee and the standing committee. In order to handle daily affairs, an office is set up within the People's Bank.

3. The interest rate is low and the term is long. The interest rate is calculated at 90% of the average interest rate quoted by the Interest Rate Committee, and the term is two months.

4. The People's Bank provides the necessary financial support to private banks and money shops participating in the joint lending office. Interbank day lending has increased from three times a month to four times.

In the two months since the establishment of the Public-Private Financial Industry Joint Lending Office, a total of 12 billion yuan has been lent, and 65 factories have received assistance.

Last year, the Tianjin People's Bank organized two banking syndicates. All private banks and money shops participated. The first banking syndicate had 14 members with a capital of 70,000 real savings units; the second banking syndicate had 12 members with a capital of 60,000 units. The loan target was factories, with a term of one month and an interest rate of 1% to 1.5%. In addition to loans, deposits were also accepted, and both deposits and loans were calculated according to the Tianjin People's Bank's real savings quotation.

Under the influence of the Tianjin and Shanghai banking syndicates, cities such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuxi also organized private banking syndicates or joint lending offices.

We believe that the joint organization of lending offices or banking syndicates by public and private silver and money businesses to jointly support production is the correct path and direction of development for private banks and money shops, which is beneficial to both production and the banks and money shops themselves.

Private factories need a large amount of long-term loans for support. Due to limited funds, banks and money shops can only provide short-term and small-amount lending, so factory capitalists are often distressed by the lack of working capital. The Joint Lending Office has more abundant funds and can provide loans with longer terms and larger amounts. It is truly helpful to production.

Although private banks and money shops invest the deposits they absorb into commerce, they can obtain more profits from a temporary point of view, but there are risks. Last year, some businesses in Tianjin went bankrupt, and many banks and money shops were stuck with bad debts. Investing funds in the production sector, on the one hand, reduces risks and ensures more guaranteed profits, and at the same time, can obtain the assistance of the National Bank; more importantly, private banks and money shops can gradually dissolve into production undertakings through supporting production, which is the final destination of private banks and money shops.

The Common Program stipulates: "Under necessary and possible conditions, private capital should be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism." The joint lending office of public and private silver and money businesses belongs to the nature of state capitalism. Financial workers in various places should organize private banks and money shops under the principle of voluntariness and move towards the road of supporting production.

In addition to organizing together and using collective strength to support production, the number of individual banks and money shops investing funds in production is also gradually increasing. It is especially worth mentioning that the Shanghai China Trust Bank handles agricultural loans.

Last year, in July, the China Trust Bank responded to the government's call to "send funds to the countryside" and sent personnel to investigate the Luli District of Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. The area was severely affected by wind disasters, but the rice field harvest was still promising and urgently needed fertilizer and field powder (other fertilizers such as bean cake were too late in terms of time). The China Trust Bank allocated 16.5 million yuan in RMB to purchase 30 tons of Yongli fertilizer and lend it to farmers in Luli District. After the fertilizer arrived on August 27, the loan work was successfully completed through the Luli District Cooperative under the guidance and assistance of the local People's Bank. The loan was recovered on November 4, with a total of 717 shi, 9 dou, and 6 sheng of brown rice, which was sold for 53.1 million yuan in RMB, with a profit of 60% calculated in kind. (According to the price increase from late August to early November, prices doubled).

Second, some private banks and money shops continued to speculate and profiteer, violating government laws. As a result, they were subjected to strict inspection and punishment by the People's Government. Some suffered heavy losses, and some were suspended. Their illegal activities can be roughly divided into three types:

1. Establishing back-books and reselling gold, silver, and materials.

For example, the Tianjin Hesunxing Money Shop never reported all back-books and materials to the Military Control Commission's Finance Department after liberation. On May 25 last year, the People's Bank sent personnel to inspect and found that it had privately sold five taels of gold, and seized six back-books, fifty taels of gold, and eighty bags of flour on the spot. The manager of the shop attempted to bribe the inspectors and asked someone to intercede, but was sternly rejected. The Finance Department decided to severely punish this illegal behavior according to law and commended the inspectors for their integrity in refusing bribes.

The Hankou Qiantaiyu Bank allocated 20 million yuan last July to open the Dayu Salt Shop and invested 2 million yuan in the Zhenhua Thread Factory, a private commercial enterprise. The Dayu Salt Shop set up a branch in Shanghai, colluding with the Shanghai branch to engage in speculation. The bank successively loaned more than 300 million yuan to the Dayu Salt Shop. It also seized secret accounts of the bank with secret accounts such as Tianji, Yuji, and Zhaoji (all important staff members of the bank), who borrowed more than 24 million yuan from the bank's treasury. The bank also colluded with the Xinchang Pigment Shop, Zhenhua Thread Factory, Xietong Barge Factory, and other commercial firms, falsely making loans of 79.22 million yuan, buying foreign exchange of 69 million yuan, and transferring it for off-the-books operations and to increase capital for the Shenhan banks. After repeated inspections by the People's Bank, Zheng Zhongzhao, the deputy manager of the bank, repeatedly deceived and defrauded, and repeatedly guaranteed that there had been no speculative activities in the past. Only because there was evidence in the secret accounts that proved all the speculative facts, completely exposing the speculators' masks. In addition to ordering the bank to suspend business, Zheng Zhongzhao was sent to the court for legal action.

2. Indiscriminate lending and credit expansion.

In order to guide silver and money businesses to conduct normal deposit and loan business and avoid financial turmoil caused by excessive credit lending, Article 15 of the North China Private Silver and Money Business Management Measures stipulates: "Credit lending shall not exceed half of the total deposits." However, most banks and money shops did not implement it in accordance with the law. For example, the Shanghai branch of Tonghui Industrial Bank was unable to make up the clearing difference of 35 million yuan on November 18 last year. In order to protect normal social credit, the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Finance Department strictly implemented the silver and money business management measures and ordered it to suspend business. According to the bank's employees, the deposits were 300 million yuan, and the loans were more than 200 million yuan, of which 150 million yuan was issued by the manager Ding Yongliang and others, most of which were bad debts.

3. Bank and money shop leaders and employees privately manage deposits and loans.

The responsible personnel of the Shanghai Qichang Bank (manager, deputy manager, supervisor, assistant manager) embezzled more than 200 million yuan of bank funds, privately engaged in lending, and falsely set up as many as 17 secret accounts, and more than 100 people held secret account checks issued by the bank's responsible personnel, forcing the bank to open fixed deposit certificates of 190 million yuan. Under this circumstance, on November 22 last year, the bank's clearing difference of 180 million yuan could not be made up. The Finance Department ordered the bank to permanently suspend business and liquidate within a time limit.

After liberation, some managers of banks and money shops doubted: "Do we have a future in a new democratic society?" The above materials are a clear picture, pointing out the path of private banks and money shops. As long as they face production and support production, they all have a future. If they speculate and profiteer, they will inevitably be eliminated by society. It is hoped that private banks and money shops in various places will completely eliminate the bad habits of speculation and profiteering and move towards a new road of supporting production.

　　私营银钱业的道路
            （一）投机倒把的旧路已走不通
    资本主义发展的规律，是从产业资本到银行资本，最后银行资本又反过来控制产业，变成帝国主义时代的财政资本。解放前的旧中国，是半殖民地半封建的社会，产业并不发达，尤其在抗战时期生产萎缩，但银行钱庄却不断增加。如一九三六年上海有私营行庄七十六家，一九四九年增至二百一十家，十三年间增加二倍。这是一种畸形现象。
    抗战后私营行庄为什么增加、他们如何经营呢？在国民党反动统治下，通货膨胀，物价高涨，货币贬值，银行钱庄为了获取暴利，大都进行投机倒把。如囤积物资，捣卖金钞，高利放款等。用于扶助生产的资金甚少。为了逃免国民党政府检查，在前账之外都设立一本、二本、甚至三本的后账。后账运用的资金占百分之八十以上，而前账只有百分之十至二十。据统计，北京天津解放前私营行庄二百家以上，用于扶植生产的资金只有百分之一·七到三·四。这种投机倒把的行为，在新民主主义社会是走不通的，是会遭受人民政府严厉取缔的。
            （二）人民政府对私营银钱业的政策
    共同纲领第三十九条规定“金融事业应受国家严格管理”。“依法营业的私人金融事业，应受国家的监督和指导。凡进行金融投机破坏国家金融事业者，应受严厉制裁”。这就是人民政府对私营银钱业的基本政策。
    北京、天津、上海、汉口、西安等城市解放后，各地人民政府都颁布“私营银钱业管理暂行办法”，在这些办法中，明确规定银行钱庄可以经营那些正当业务，不准经营那些非法业务，如有违犯予以处分。如前华北人民政府一九四九年四月二十七日颁布之华北区私营银钱业管理暂行办法第四条规定：“私营银钱业以经营下列业务为限：一、收受各种存款，二、办理各种放款与票据贴现，三、解放区内汇兑及押汇，四、经中国人民银行特许之区外及国外汇兑，五、票据承兑，六、代理收付款项，七、工矿业投资，八、保管贵重物品。”
    第六条又规定：“银钱业之财务经营不得有下列行为：一、为公私商号或其他银钱业之股东（工矿业投资除外），二、收买或承兑本行庄之股票，三、购买非营业所必需之不动产，四、兼营商业囤积货物，或代客买卖，五、设立副账或作不确实之记载，六、签发本票，七、收受一切军政团体机关及公营企业之存款，八、金银、外国货币之买卖抵押放款，九、代人出面保有财物，十、其他未经批准之行为。”这些规定是符合共同纲领精神的。
    总之人民政府对私营银钱业的政策是两方面的，凡业务正当的私营行庄，政府允许其存在，并予以指导帮助，使其走向扶助生产事业的道路。另一方面对于那些投机倒把非法经营，不遵守政府法令者，则进行严格检查管理，并按情节轻重，予以警告、罚金，令其撤换重要职员、停止票据交换、停止营业等处分。
            （三）扶助生产呢，还是继续投机倒把呢？
    根据北京、天津、上海、汉口等地材料来看，解放后私营银钱业的基本动向有两种：
    第一、有些行庄遵守政府法令，在国家银行组织指导帮助下，向扶助生产事业的道路前进，结果都营业开展盈利不少。私营行庄资金投入生产事业的形式有两种：一是集体的，如组织银团或联合放款处；一是个体的。
    上海人民银行为引导游资投向生产，并协助私营纱厂解决采购原棉之资金困难，于去年九月二十三日组织上海私营银钱信托业联合放款处，参加的银行钱庄信托公司共一百二十七家、资金四十亿（共八百单位，每单位五百万元）。贷款对象是上海市棉纱业所组织的联合购棉处，利息照上海金融业利率委员会最高利率之八折至九折计算，半月结息一次，期限两月。人民银行为了解决私营银钱业资金投入生产后所发生的资金周转困难，特制定同业拆放办法：（一）当银根紧缩，存款减少，放款不能及时收回以致付现准备不敷时，经人民银行同意得办理同业日拆以资调剂；（二）拆放利率不得低于放款利率；（三）每月最多拆放三次，每次得连续转期三天；（四）拆放金额以实际贷款总额之七折为限。为了加强对联合放款处之领导与扶助，使其在新中国的经济建设中起更大作用，上海私营银钱业信托业联合放款处，对棉纺业联购处贷款期满后，在人民银行领导下，十二月十七日重新组织公私营金融业联合放款处。参加公私行庄一百五十余家（上海私营行庄一百七十八家，除十几家受停业处分不算外，差不多都参加了），资本额一百二十亿；国家银行（人民银行、交通银行）二十亿。国营银行与私营行庄联合起来组织放款处，这是私营银团的进一步发展。它有如下特点：
    一、贷款对象与用途有明确规定：Ａ，贷款范围较广泛，不限于某一行业，凡有益于国计民生之生产事业，均可申请贷款。Ｂ，贷款对象，以能继续生产，并有发展前途者为限。Ｃ，贷款用途限于购办原料，增加生产，不得偿还债务。Ｄ、作重点贷款，不作普通性之贷放。Ｅ、放款对象须选择信用可靠具有充分保证品者，并须邀同殷实厂商作保证人，并有切实偿还计划者。
    二、人民银行的领导与民主管理相结合。参加联合放款处的全体行庄代表中推选十五人，组织联放处委员会，负责处理贷款之审核、收付、放款处之账务清算，各公私行庄间之联系等事项。在全体委员中，互推常务委员六人，组织常务委员会。为了集体审核放款，委员会与常务委员会暂定每周开会一次。凡贷款三亿以上者，由委员会审核通过。三亿以下者由常委会通过，委员会追认。人民银行上海分行之代表为委员会与常务委员会之当然主席，为了处理日常事务，在人民银行内设立事务所。
    三、利息较低，期限较长，利息按利息委员会挂牌之平均利息九折计算，期限两个月。
    四、人民银行对参加联放处之私营行庄予以资金上之必要支持，同业日拆由过去之每月三次增为四次。
    公私营金融业联放处成立的两个多月中，共贷款一百二十亿，六十五家工厂得到扶助。
    天津人民银行去年组织两个银团，私营行庄全部参加第一银团十四家，资金七万个折实储蓄单位；第二银团十二家，资金六万单位。贷款对象为工厂，期限一月，利息一分至一分五厘。除贷款外，并吸收存款，存款与贷款均按天津人民银行折实储蓄牌价计算。
    在津沪银团的影响下，苏州、杭州、无锡等城市亦纷纷组织私营银团或联合放款处。
    我们认为公私营银钱业联合起来组织放款或银团，共同扶助生产事业，这是私营行庄的正确道路和发展方向，它对生产事业和行庄本身，都是有利的。
    私营工厂需要大量的长期的贷款扶助。行庄因资金所限，只能作短期的小额拆放，因此工厂资本家经常为拆借头寸而苦恼。联合放款处资金较雄厚，则可发放期限长、数额大的贷款。它对生产事业是真正有帮助的。
    私营行庄将吸收之存款，投入商业，虽然从暂时利益看，获利较多，但是有风险的。去年天津有些商业倒闭，行庄吃呆账的不少。将资金投入生产部门，一方面减少风险，利润较有保障，同时可以得到国家银行之扶助；更重要的是私营行庄通过扶助生产，可以逐渐溶化于生产事业中，这是私营行庄的最后归宿地。
    共同纲领中规定：“在必要和可能的条件下，应鼓励私人资本，向国家资本主义方向发展”。公私营银钱业联合放款处，是属于国家资本主义性质的，各地金融工作者，应在自愿原则下，把私营行庄组织起来，走向扶助生产事业的道路。
    私营行庄除了组织起来，运用集体力量扶助生产外，个别行庄将资金投入生产的也逐渐增多，特别值得提出的，是上海中信银行办理农贷。
    去年七月中信银行响应政府“资金下乡”的号召，曾派员到江苏吴江县黎里区一带调查，该区受风灾较重，惟稻田收成仍有希望，急需施肥田粉（其他肥料如豆饼等时间上已来不及）。中信银行拨人民币一千六百五十万元，买永利肥田粉三十吨，贷给黎里区农民。八月二十七日肥田粉运到后，在当地人民银行指导协助下，通过黎里区合作社顺利完成贷放工作。十一月四日收回贷款，共收糙米七百一十七石九斗六升，售人民币五千三百一十万元，按实物计算，盈利达百分之六十。（按八月下旬至十一月上旬，物价上涨一倍）。
    第二、有一部分私营行庄继续投机倒把，违犯政府法令，结果都遭受人民政府的严格检查与处分，有的亏累不堪，有的停业。他们的非法活动，大约可分三种类型：
    一、设立后账，倒卖金银物资。
    例如天津和顺兴钱庄，所有后账暨物资，解放后始终未向军管会金融处呈报。去年五月二十五日人民银行派员检查，发现私卖黄金五两，并当场查获后账六本，黄金五十两，面粉八十袋，该庄经理企图向检查人员行贿，并托人说情，均遭严正拒绝。金融处对此种违法行为，决依法严惩，对检查人员拒绝受贿的廉洁作风，予以表扬。
    汉口谦泰豫银行，去年七月拨资金二千万元开设大豫盐号，又以二百万元投资震华线厂私营商业。大豫盐号在上海设立分庄，与该上海分行互相勾结，从事投机，该行先后向大豫盐号贷款三亿余元。又抄获该行暗账内有田记、余记、赵记（均为该行重要职员）等暗户，向该行挪借库款二千四百余万元。该行又勾通新昌颜料行、震华线厂、协通驳船厂等商号，假作放款七千九百二十二万元，买汇六千九百万元，移作账外经营，及申汉两行增资之用。上述违法行为，经人民银行屡次检查，该行副经理郑重钊始终捏辞欺诈，并数度具结保证过去未有任何投机活动。只因暗账有据，证明全部投机事实，彻底暴露投机者的假面具。除令该行停业外，并将郑重钊送法院法办。
    二、滥行放账，信用膨胀。
    为了指导银钱业进行正常的存放款业务，避免因信用放款过度膨胀，发生金融风潮。华北私营银钱业管理办法第十五条规定：“信用放款不得超过存款总额之半”。但大多数行庄，不按照法令执行。如通惠实业银行上海分行，去年十一月十八日票据交换差额三千五百万元不能补足。上海军管会金融处，为了保障社会正常信用，严格执行银钱业管理办法，予以停业处分。据该行职工说，存款三亿元，放款二亿余元，其中一亿五千万由经理丁永良等经手放出，大部都为呆账。
    三、行庄负责人与职员私自经营存放款。
    上海其昌银行负责人员（经理、副理、监理、襄理）挪用行款二亿余元，私营拆放，虚设暗户达十七个之多，并有一百余人，手持该行负责人所立暗户支票，强迫该行开定期存单达一亿九千万元。在此情况下，去年十一月二十二日该行票据交换差额一亿八千万元无法补足，金融处令该行永远停业，限期清理。
    解放后有些银行钱庄经理们怀疑：“新民主主义社会里，我们有无前途”？上述材料是一幅显明图画，它指出了私营行庄的道路，只要面向生产，扶助生产，都是有前途的。如果投机倒把，必然被社会所淘汰。希望各地私营行庄，彻底革除投机倒把的恶习，走向扶助生产的新道路。
