Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. Chongqing, Southern Sichuan and other places are actively carrying out warehouse clearance work. The responsible organs of the Southwest Military and Political Committee have decided that all materials will be frozen during the clearance period. If urgently needed for work, a budget should be prepared and submitted to the financial organs of the Southwest Military and Political Committee for approval before it can be borrowed; it will only be legal after approval by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. From January onwards, the materials received by various departments can be converted into part of the 1950 budget at their value. In order to unify the valuation standards, the committee has established a valuation committee.

　　Following the clearance of large quantities of materials from the 21st and 29th Ordnance Factories in Chongqing, the 10th, 20th, 24th, 50th and other ordnance factories, as well as the state-owned China Industrial Development Corporation, have also recently cleared large quantities of useful equipment and raw materials. The 20th Ordnance Factory and its First Branch Factory have initially cleared 140 discarded machines, 300,693 kilograms of machine parts, 200,171 kilograms of scrap materials, more than 200 tons of various copper casings and sheets, 212,161 kilograms of scrap iron, more than 2,300 iron buckets, and approximately 300 tons or more of steel ingot scraps, all discarded in the open air and in caves. The 10th Ordnance Factory cleared 49 machines, and more than 140 tons of scrap steel and scrap iron. The 50th Factory cleared 383 tons of machine parts, 258 tons of useful materials, and 164 tons of waste products and scraps. The 24th Factory found as much as 500 tons of gate steel on the roadbed of the transportation railway. The China Industrial Development Corporation cleared more than 2,000 pieces of useful equipment such as water pipes, sandboxes, mine cars, and turntables, and unearthed 3 tons of scrap copper and scrap iron, 3 tons of fluorite, and 5 tons of manganese sand (fluorite and manganese sand are both essential raw materials for steelmaking) from the soil. The Huxian Telecommunications Equipment Repair Factory in Southern Sichuan District also cleared a large number of useful equipment. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 129 various types of telephones and hand-cranked generators, 286 mica-wound resistors, and more than 500 kilograms of cast copper, cast zinc, cast aluminum, and insulating materials, as well as approximately 5,000 pieces of more than 200 types of telegraph and telephone parts, and another 600-watt generator were cleared. The materials cleared by each unit have now been registered separately and sent to the warehouse. Clearance is still continuing in various places.
