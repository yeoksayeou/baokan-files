　　Beijing Retail Company's "August 1st" Flour Sales Are Good

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued its decision on changing the standards for grain processing on April 1st, the Beijing Retail Company immediately launched active preparation and publicity work. Because "August 1st" flour had not yet been produced in Beijing at that time, 100,000 jin of Shanghai "August 1st" flour was allocated at the beginning of this month and was first sold in retail stores in the city on April 7th. Sales have been good since then, with a total of more than 30,000 jin sold in seven days. The general public has responded very well to this. For example, a citizen in the 9th district said to the local retail store after buying and eating "August 1st" flour: "’August 1st’ flour is cheap, 100 yuan cheaper per jin than Camel flour, and the quality is also good. Not only is the flour dry and absorbs a lot of water, but it is also not sticky. The government really thinks of ways for the people." The company's stock of Shanghai August 1st flour is about to be sold out, and it is preparing to allocate a large quantity of standard Beijing "August 1st" general flour in the near future to supply citizens.

　　京零售公司“八一”粉销售情况良好
    【本报讯】自四月一日中央人民政府政务院发布关于改变粮食加工标准办法决定后，北京市零售公司随即展开积极准备和宣传工作，因当时北京“八一”粉尚未制出，即于本月初旬拨来上海“八一”面粉十万斤，至四月七日首先开始在市内各零售店出售。销售以来情况良好，统计七日间共售出达三万余斤。一般群众对此反映极佳，如第九区市民于买到“八一”面食用后向该处零售店说：“‘八一’面价格低，比骆驼面每斤便宜一百元，质量也好，不但粉质干、吃水多，而且又不粘，政府真会替人民想办法。”该公司所存之上海八一粉即将售罄，准备于近日大量调拨标准北京“八一”通粉，供应市民。
