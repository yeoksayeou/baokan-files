Xinhua News Agency, 16th: A summary of TASS reports: Public opinion in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries has expressed deep indignation at the provocative incident of a US military aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace.

The Polish People's Tribune published a special article entitled "The Adventurism of Warmongers is Destined to End in Miserable Failure," stating that US imperialism brazenly violated international law, arousing the deep indignation of people all over the world. This act of aggression nakedly exposes the despicable and shameless means adopted by the warmongers.

The newspaper pointed out that the counterattack against the act of invading the Soviet border should serve as a warning to them.

All Hungarian newspapers published editorials or special articles on the matter. The Free People's Daily wrote: Obviously, American imperialists are keen on copying the magic weapons of their fascist forefathers. The very fact that a US plane flew over the Soviet border is already an extremely significant act of violating international law. However, the US plane also refused to land and shot at Soviet planes over Soviet territory. The provocative attempt by the imperialist gamblers could not be more obvious.

Czechoslovak newspapers published the Soviet government's note to the US government and international comments on the matter. The Czechoslovak public believes that the rude behavior of the American bomber once again proves that the American ruling groups, who dream of establishing world hegemony for American monopoly capital by launching a new war, blatantly disregard international law conventions, the sovereignty of other countries, and the freedom and independence of all peoples. Bulgarian newspapers all carried the Soviet government's note and foreign newspapers' comments on the incident. The Fatherland Front published a commentary entitled "Unprecedented American Provocation."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to a report from Copenhagen by Teletype on the 14th: Although the Americans have openly admitted that there is now no hope of finding the whereabouts of the "missing plane," they announced that they will continue to conduct a comprehensive search. At the same time, resentment against American military exercises and provocations is growing here. Even the normally pro-American Danish newspaper "Politiken" expressed dissatisfaction on the 13th, saying: The Americans claim that the last time they contacted the missing plane, it was only five kilometers north of Hamburg, which is a lie. The newspaper questioned why the search was not also conducted over the North Sea, but instead "deliberately" searched the waters between Bornholm Island and the Swedish coast from the beginning?

All of these circumstances confirm the assertion made by the "Land and People" newspaper a few days ago. The newspaper said: "The American military aircraft was acting on orders and was in constant contact with its departure station. It received the order to shoot from its departure station." Therefore, the Americans already knew what had happened on April 8th. They moved the Flying Fortress from North Africa and north of the Azores to the Gastrup Airport, consciously continuing the provocation. As a result of this action, Copenhagen and Denmark have become the center of this criminal act from the very beginning, which is tantamount to playing with fire.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 15th: The shameless provocation of the American warmongers has aroused the deep anger of Swedish democrats. Swedish peace-loving people know that the concentration of the US Air Force in the Baltic Sea, and so on, is to exert pressure on Sweden. "The Worker's Paper" claimed that Swedish public opinion is extremely angry at the American plane's intrusion into Swedish territory.

　　东欧人民民主国家舆论谴责美机侵犯苏联领空
    丹瑞人民对美帝挑衅极为愤怒
    【新华社十六日讯】综合塔斯社消息：东欧各人民民主国家的舆论，对美国军用机侵犯苏联领空的挑衅事件深表愤慨。
    波兰人民论坛报以“战争贩子的冒险注定了要惨败”为题发表专文称：美帝国主义者蛮横地违反国际法，激起了全世界人民的深深愤慨。这种侵犯行为赤裸裸地暴露出战争贩子所采取的手段之卑鄙无耻。
    该报指出：对侵犯苏联边疆行为的反击，应该是对他们的一个警告。
    一切匈牙利的报纸都就此事发表社论或专文。自由人民报写道：显然地，美国帝国主义者正在热中于抄袭他们法西斯祖师的法宝。美机飞越苏联边境这件事本身，就已经是极其重大的破坏国际法的行为，但是，美国飞机还拒绝降落，并在苏联领土上射击苏联飞机。帝国主义赌徒们的挑衅企图，再不能比这更明显了。
    捷克斯洛伐克各报刊登了苏联政府致美国政府的照会以及国际方面对此事的评论。捷克斯洛伐克公众认为，美国轰炸机的无礼行为，再度证明了梦想以发动新战争来建立美国垄断资本的世界霸权的美国统治集团，悍然不顾国际法惯例、其他国家的主权，以及各族人民的自由与独立。保加利亚各报均刊载了苏联政府的照会，并刊载了外国报纸对此事件的评论。祖国阵线报发表评论，题为“美国空前的挑衅”。
    【新华社十六日讯】据电通社哥本哈根十四日讯：虽然美国人已经公开承认现在没有找出“失踪飞机”下落的希望，但是他们宣布他们将要继续进行全面的寻觅。同时，此地对于美国军事演习和挑衅的愤恨，正在增长，甚至连平素亲美的丹麦“政策”报在十三日也表示不满说：美国人声称他们最后一次与失踪飞机联络时，该机仅在汉堡以北五公里，这是撒谎。该报质问，因为什么不也在北海上面进行寻找，反而自始就“故意”到波荷尔姆岛和瑞典海岸之间的水面上去搜索呢？
    所有这些情形证实了“国土与人民”报数日之前的断言。该报说：“美国的军用飞机是按照命令行动的，并且一直和它的起飞站有连络。它是从它的起飞站得到射击命令的”。所以，美国人在四月八日已经知道有什么事情发生了。他们把空中堡垒从北非和亚速尔群岛北边移到加斯特鲁普机场，完全有意识地继续进行挑衅。由于这个行动，哥本哈根和丹麦从最初就变成了这个罪恶行为的中心，而这个罪恶行为无异于玩火焚身。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩十五日讯：美国战争贩子的无耻挑衅，引起了瑞典民主分子的深刻愤怒。瑞典拥护和平的人们知道，美国空军集中于波罗的海以及其他等等，是为了对瑞典施用压力。《工人报》声称，瑞典舆论对美机侵犯瑞典国境极表愤怒。
