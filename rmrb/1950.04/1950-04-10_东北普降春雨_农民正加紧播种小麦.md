　　Northeast China Experiences Widespread Spring Rain
　　Farmers are Stepping Up Wheat Sowing
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] From April 1st to 3rd, Northeast China experienced widespread rainfall, and wheat sowing is being stepped up. Since mid-March, in coastal areas of Liaoxi and Liaodong provinces and the right bank area of the Songhua River, farmers in some districts and villages, led and promoted by Communist Party members and model laborers, have successively begun plowing and sowing wheat. Heilongjiang Province, the latest in terms of seasonal timing but a major wheat-producing area, based on the experience of early planting and increased harvests last year, also began sowing in late March. After the widespread spring rain from April 1st to 3rd, wheat sowing has been further accelerated. In Liaoxi Province, Xinmin, Panshan, Tai'an, and Liaozhong counties; in Songjiang Province, Shuangcheng and Tangyuan counties; in Jilin Province, Shulan and Fuyu counties; and in Liaodong Province, Haicheng county, wheat sowing has been completed.

    农民正加紧播种小麦
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北各地于四月一日至三日普遍落雨，小麦播种工作正在加紧进行。自三月中旬起，辽西、辽东两省沿海地区及松花江右岸地带，部分区村农民即在共产党员和劳动模范带头推动下，相继开犁播种小麦。季节最晚的黑龙江省主要产麦区根据去年早种多收的经验，亦提前在三月底纷纷开始播种。四月一日至三日各地普降春雨后，小麦播种更形加紧。辽西省的新民、盘山、台安、辽中，松江省的双城、汤原，吉林省的舒兰、扶余，辽东省的海城等县小麦已全部播种完毕。
