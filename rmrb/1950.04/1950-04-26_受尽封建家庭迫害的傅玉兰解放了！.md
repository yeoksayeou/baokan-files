　　Fu Yulan, Who Suffered From Persecution in a Feudal Family, is Liberated!
　　Fu Yulan was from Deping County, Shandong Province. She lost her father at a young age. Her family consisted of her mother and a younger sister, and the three of them lived together, relying on each other. Initially, they had a few acres of poor land, but due to the Kuomintang and puppet regime's extortion and the lack of labor, they were forced to sell it all. Her mother had no choice but to lead her and her sister to beg from door to door. At this time, due to the pressure of life, her mother arranged for the thirteen-year-old Fu Yulan to be betrothed to a nine-year-old boy named Sun Jiewu. Unfortunately, the years were bad, and Shandong Province was plagued by insect pests, and life became more and more difficult. The three of them, mother and daughters, really couldn't support themselves any longer. In order to find another way out, her mother urged the Sun family to take her as a daughter-in-law when she was not yet fourteen years old. At that time, Sun Jiewu was only ten years old and, due to the pressures of life, had gone to the Northeast with his older brother. Although she herself was unwilling, she had no choice but to take this path in order to survive. So, in December 1944, she married with her young sister-in-law holding a rooster. The following spring, she and her mother-in-law arrived in Jilin one after another.
　　Fu Yulan was originally a farmer's child, but because she was young and weak, she could not meet her mother-in-law Sun Fu's unreasonable demands, which caused her to be abused in every possible way and treated as less than human. For five years, she was tormented at all times.
　　In terms of eating, Fu Yulan, except for the evening of Lunar New Year's Eve when she ate dumplings with the family (her mother-in-law did this for the sake of family reunion and good luck), she could only eat leftovers after the whole family had finished eating. If they made bobo (cornmeal cakes), her mother-in-law would lock them up after the family had finished eating, leaving her only one or two pieces, regardless of whether it was enough or not. Therefore, she was often hungry. When she was too hungry, she secretly asked her cousin's third grandmother for something to eat (she was also a beggar). Neighbors pitied her and sometimes gave her some food secretly from her mother-in-law. If her mother-in-law found out, she would be beaten severely. Therefore, she often endured her hunger and dared not speak easily, only taking advantage of the opportunity to work outside to beg for something to eat from others. If this delayed her work and she returned home late, she would also be punished.
　　Fu Yulan rarely wore decent clothes. Usually, she was ragged and exposed her skin. Even in the dead of winter, she was barefoot, often picking up discarded broken shoes to wear. For the five or six years of her marriage, she rarely lived with her husband. In winter, the whole family slept on the heated kang, but her mother-in-law told her to sleep alone on the cold kang in a cold room, which caused her legs to catch a chill, and she still suffers from cramps from time to time.
　　After liberation, women had organizations, and Sun Fu also heard some rumors about the People's Government protecting women's rights. In addition, persuaded by people in the same courtyard, she allowed Fu Yulan and her son to sleep in the same room from 1950 onwards. However, the husband was at the head of the kang, the mother-in-law was in the middle, both with bedding, while Fu Yulan slept at the end of the kang, covered only with a broken mat, which was not much better than sleeping in a cold room. One day, her mother-in-law got angry and locked her in the outer room again. She begged bitterly all night, but was not allowed to go to the inner room.
　　Many heavy tasks in the family, such as carrying water, cooking, and chopping firewood, were done by Fu Yulan. Every year, she raised several pigs. In addition to feeding and taking care of them, she also had to carry distiller's grains from an alcohol factory about a mile away. She didn't eat enough, she was not strong enough, and she walked slowly. Workers at the alcohol factory took pity on her and often gave her food to eat. After eating, she repeatedly told them not to let her mother-in-law know. Her mother-in-law required her to spin two liang of cotton every day. She was busy with work during the day and afraid of disturbing others' sleep at night, so she had to spin on the ground or in the outer room. Alone in the cold winter night, accompanied by a spinning wheel, she could only rest after midnight. The next day, when selling the thread, it would be fine if she sold it at a high price, but if she couldn't sell it or if the weight was short, she would be unlucky and would be beaten and scolded.
　　In the past, when her husband was young, she only suffered from her mother-in-law. Later, when her husband grew up, the mother and son would fight her with fists and feet. Every time she was beaten, it was lucky if she didn't get her clothes torn or bleed. The scars on her face that were twisted by her mother-in-law were commonplace for neighbors and workers at the alcohol factory. She couldn't remember how many times she had been beaten in the past. In the short two or three months of this year alone, she had been beaten five or six times. Once, because she was slow in serving the hot pig feed, the stove smoked, and her mother-in-law twisted her hair and beat her. Her husband came over and slapped her so hard that her nose and mouth bled. Neighbors, fearing that someone would die, reported it to the police station. Sun Fu, afraid of being punished, forced her to wash away the blood stains and threatened her not to tell the truth.
　　At the end of March, Fu Yulan was beaten severely by her mother-in-law again. She felt that she could no longer live this kind of life, so she took the opportunity to report to the director of the police station. With the help of the police station, neighbors, and the Women's Federation, she learned about the marriage policy of the People's Government and realized that her mother-in-law and husband's abuse of her was illegal. She gained courage and ran to the Jilin City People's Court to request the dissolution of this unreasonable marriage and to accuse her mother-in-law and husband of their abuse.
　　After trial by the Jilin City People's Court, this unreasonable marriage relationship was legally dissolved, and the court awarded her half of the pigs that Fu Yulan had raised with her blood and sweat. Fu Yulan, who had suffered all kinds of torment, was forever liberated, while Sun Fu, who brutally abused her, was punished by the people's law with three months of detention.

### 受尽封建家庭迫害的傅玉兰解放了！

　　受尽封建家庭迫害的傅玉兰解放了！
    傅玉兰，山东省德平县人。从小便死了父亲，家中只有母亲和一个妹妹，母女三人，相依度日。起初还有几亩薄田，因当时敌伪敲榨勒索，又无人劳动，被迫全部卖掉了，母亲只好领着她姊妹二人，挨门乞讨。这时因生活所迫，母亲作主将十三岁的傅玉兰许与一个九岁的孩子孙介武。偏偏年景不好，山东普遍闹虫灾，生活一天比一天困难，母女三人实在支持不下去了；母亲为了另寻出路，在她还不满十四岁时，就催促孙家娶媳妇。那时孙介武年仅十岁，亦因生活所迫，跟他哥哥到东北去了。她本人虽然不愿意，但为了活命，也只好走这条路，就在一九四四年十二月，和她小姑抱着公鸡结了婚。第二年春天，和她婆婆也先后到了吉林。
    傅玉兰本来是个农家孩子，但因年岁小，力气弱，不能满足婆婆孙傅氏对她的无理要求，因此引起婆婆的百般虐待，拿她不当人看待。五年的期间，无时不被折磨着。
    在吃饭方面，傅玉兰一年当中，除掉大年三十晚上和一家人共同吃一顿饺子（婆婆为了全家团聚吉利）以外，都是全家吃完饭后，她才能吃一口残茶剩饭。如果做了饽饽（包米面饼子），家人吃完后，婆婆就锁起来，给她留下一两块，够不够是不管的，因此经常吃不饱。饿得她实在没有办法的时候，就偷偷地向她同族三奶奶要一点吃（她也是要饭的）。街坊邻居可怜她，有时背着她婆婆给她一点饭菜，如果被婆婆发觉了，就要挨一顿毒打，所以她经常忍着肚饿也不敢轻易开口，只有借着到外面做活的机会，向人家讨一些吃，要是因此而耽误了做活时间，回去晚了些也要受到责罚。
    傅玉兰从来很少穿上一件像样的衣裳，平常总是褴褛不堪的露着肉；十冬腊月还光着脚，常常拣人家扔掉的破鞋子穿。结婚五、六年，很少和丈夫在一起住。冬天，全家都睡在热炕上，婆婆却叫她一人睡在一间冷冰房的凉炕上，因而腿部受了寒，至今还有时犯痉挛的毛病。
    解放后，妇女有了组织，孙傅氏也听到一些关于人民政府保护妇女权利的风声，再加上同院人的劝说，自一九五○年起才允许傅玉兰和她母子们同屋睡觉；但是丈夫在炕头，婆婆在中间，都有铺有盖，而傅玉兰睡在炕梢，却只盖一件破褥头，比在冷冰房里也好不了多少。有一天，婆婆生气了，又把她关在外屋里，她苦苦哀求一夜，也没有被允许到里间去。
    家中许多重活如挑水、煮饭、劈柴等都由傅玉兰来做。每年养活几口猪，她除了喂养照料外，还得到一里来地的酒精工厂去挑酒糟。吃的不饱，力气不足，走路也慢。酒精厂工友看她可怜，常常自动给她饭吃，吃完后，她一再嘱咐千万别让婆婆知道。婆婆每天要她纺二两花，白天活计忙，晚上又怕妨碍别人睡觉，只好在地下或外间屋里纺，一个人在严寒的冬夜，伴着一辆纺车，总在半夜以后才能休息。第二天卖线的时候，如果以高价卖出去还好，要是卖不出去或是脱了秤，那就倒霉了，脱不过要挨一顿打骂。
    从前丈夫小，只有婆婆给气受；以后丈夫大了，母子二人打起来拳脚交加，每次挨打不破衣、不流血就算便宜。她的脸被婆婆扭破的伤痕，邻居和酒精厂工友是司空见惯的。过去挨打的次数，她已经记不清了，仅是今年短短的两三个月中，就已挨打了五、六次。有一次因为热猪食端锅慢了，炉子冒了烟，婆婆扭着头发打她，丈夫过来一巴掌打得她鼻子、嘴都流了血。邻居怕闹出人命，报告了派出所，孙傅氏怕受处罚，逼着她把血迹洗净，并威胁不准说实话。
    三月底，傅玉兰又挨了婆婆一顿毒打，她感到这样的生活再也过不下去了，便乘机跑到派出所报告给所长。在派出所、邻居和妇联的帮助下，她了解了人民政府的婚姻政策，认识了婆婆和丈夫对她的虐待行为是非法的。她有了勇气，跑到了吉林市人民法院，声请解除这个不合理的婚姻，并对婆婆和丈夫的虐待罪行提出控诉。
    经过吉林市人民法院的审判，依法解除了这一不合理婚姻关系，傅玉兰用血汗养大的猪，法院判给了她一半。受尽折磨的傅玉兰，从此永远获得了解放，而残暴虐待她的孙傅氏，却受到了人民法律的惩罚——三个月的拘役。（吉林市人民法院民事庭）
