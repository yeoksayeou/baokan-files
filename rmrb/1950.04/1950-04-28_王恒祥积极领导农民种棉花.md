　　Wang Hengxiang Actively Leads Farmers to Grow Cotton

　　Comrade Wang Hengxiang, the Communist Party branch secretary of Dahe Village in the Fifth District of Huolu County, is 45 years old this year. He comes from a poor peasant background. Since joining the Communist Party in 1943, he has consistently and enthusiastically served the people, enjoying high prestige among the masses. In early April, he was elected as a county representative for the village. At the county representative conference, after listening to and discussing the reports from higher authorities regarding cotton planting, he thought, "Growing cotton is a political task of great importance to the country. It enriches both the country and the people. We must work hard to fulfill the task!" Dahe Village has a total of 5,823 mu of land, and the cotton planting task is 2,000 mu. After returning to the village, he estimated that the whole village could only plant a little over 1,000 mu, which would not complete the task. On April 16, the county sent an urgent directive on cotton planting. Comrade Wang Hengxiang braved the rain and mud. In the evening, he convened two meetings (a meeting of village cadre representatives and a branch meeting) to specifically study cotton planting. Because it was the busy farming season, they decided not to hold mass meetings, but to use the time when the masses were working and resting, and when they were returning home for meals, to have cadres and party members specifically divide up the work to be responsible for publicity and mobilization. They divided the whole village into four sections, and the cadres and party members into four groups. Each person was specifically assigned an object, and they began to carry out publicity and mobilization. On the morning of the 17th, he was spreading manure in the field when he met Wang Yongxiang, who was plowing the land. He asked, "Uncle Yongxiang! How many mu of cotton are you planting?" "Four mu!" "Why don't you plant a little more?" "I have to plant some grain to eat!" Comrade Wang Hengxiang started calculating with him: "One mu of land yields at least 150 jin of seed cotton, which is equivalent to more than 500 jin of rice (one jin of seed cotton can be exchanged for three jin seven taels of rice). If you plant grain, one mu of land yields at most 200 jin of rice. If you harvest cotton, are you still afraid of not having rice to eat?" Wang Yongxiang then said, "If everyone plants a lot of cotton, the price of rice will be high and the price of cotton will be low. What can we do?" Comrade Wang Hengxiang then explained to him in detail: "Our China is a large country! Other places harvest grain, and we harvest cotton. Transportation is convenient, and we can exchange it! The government has already stipulated that this year, one jin of Si-brand lint cotton is still worth eight to ten jin of rice. If you are afraid of not being insured, the cooperative will sign a contract with us. After the autumn harvest, we will give you whatever you want in exchange for the cotton!" Wang Yongxiang dispelled his worries and immediately borrowed dozens of jin of cotton seeds and planted an additional seven and a half mu of cotton. Using this method, he mobilized five households in a day and a half, planting an additional 35 mu of cotton. All the village cadres, Communist Party members, Youth League members... more than 50 people, all used this method to mobilize many people, so that the village's cotton planting acreage has exceeded 2,000 mu. This in-depth and meticulous leadership style has won unanimous praise from higher authorities and the masses. In addition, he himself has nine mu of white land, all planted with cotton, and he and his son opened up one mu of wasteland, also planted with cotton.

　　王恒祥积极领导农民种棉花
    获鹿县五区大河村共产党支部书记王恒祥同志，今年四十五岁，贫农出身，自一九四三年参加共产党后，就一贯积极、热心地为老百姓办事，在群众中威信极高。四月初当选了该村的县代表，他在县代表大会上，听了上级关于种棉工作的报告，又作了讨论，便想：“种棉花是对国家有重大关系的政治任务，又富国，又富民，一定要努把力完成任务！”大河村共有土地五千八百二十三亩，种棉任务是二千亩，他回村后估计全村只能种棉一千多亩，完不了任务。四月十六日，县里来了种棉的紧急指示，王恒祥同志冒着雨，踏着泥。晚上召集了两个会（村干部代表会，支部会），对种棉作了具体研究。因为正在农忙，他们决定不开群众大会，只利用群众干活休息，回家吃饭的时间，干部、党员具体分工负责宣传动员。他们把全村分成四片，干部、党员分成四组，每个人又具体分配了对象，即开始作宣传动员，十七日上午，他在地里倒粪，碰上了王永祥正在耕地，便问：“永祥叔！种几亩棉花？”“四亩！”“为啥不多种点？”“得种点谷子吃米呀！”王恒祥同志就跟他算开了账：“一亩地顶少摘一百五十斤籽棉，顶五百多斤米（一斤籽棉换米三斤七两），如种谷子，一亩地顶多收二百斤米，收了棉花，还怕没米吃吗？”王永祥又说：“大家种棉多喽，米贵、棉贱，可怎么办？”王恒祥同志就跟他拉扯开咧：“咱中国地面大哩！别处收了粮食，咱这收了棉花，交通方便，一换就行咧！政府已规定：今年一斤斯字皮棉，还是八斤到十斤米的价钱，若怕不保险，合作社跟咱订合同，过了秋收了棉，换什么给什么！”王永祥打消了顾虑，立时又贷了几十斤棉籽，多种了七亩半棉花，他用这种方式，一天半动员五户群众，多种三十五亩棉花，全村村干部共产党员、青年团员…………五十多人，都用这种方法动员了好多群众，使该村种棉亩数，已超过二千亩，这种深入、细致的领导作风，获得上级和群众一致赞佩。此外，他自己有九亩白地，全种了棉花，并和儿子开了一亩荒，也种了棉花。
