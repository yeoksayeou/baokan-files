[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, anticipating warmer weather and the imminent availability of refreshing drinks and foods, has decided to implement a registration system for such items, starting immediately, to safeguard public health. All shops and vendors in the city that produce and sell refreshing drinks and foods must apply for registration at the Public Health Bureau (No. 17, Baojia Street South, Xidan) and pay an inspection fee. The inspection fee is set as follows: 10 jin of millet per item for shops, and 5 jin per item for vendors (both calculated according to the previous day's reported market price for "Fu Di" millet). Vendors who are genuinely impoverished and unable to pay may be granted reductions or exemptions upon proof from their local district office, police station, or vendor management office. Anyone who manufactures or sells without registering will be prohibited from doing so.
