[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To promote thrift and encourage savings, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, in addition to increasing the provision of principal-guaranteed and value-protected fixed deposit savings, has now revised the original regulations for ordinary fixed-term discount savings and added special discount savings and fixed-term discount deposits for institutions, public enterprises, and cooperatives.

　　(1) Ordinary fixed-term discount deposits: Still divided into four types: lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal, zero deposit and lump-sum withdrawal, lump-sum deposit and zero withdrawal, and deposit principal with interest payment. However, the terms have been shortened uniformly. Lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal is from one month to one year, and the other three types are from three months to one year. The interest rate has been changed from 2% to 1%, and the method of early withdrawal has also been revised.

　　(2) Special discount savings: Limited to employees of organized public and private factories and enterprises, public employees, teachers, and students. When depositing, they must present a certificate from their service unit or trade union. Deposits are limited to once within three days from the date of each salary payment, and no further deposits are allowed after the deadline. Withdrawals can be made at any time with the passbook after three days of deposit. The amount of each deposit is stipulated that employees shall not exceed the actual salary they receive each time; students shall not exceed the monthly accommodation fee they should pay. The interest rate is 1% per month, settled every six months, and no interest is calculated for those who close their accounts before one month of deposit.

　　(3) Fixed-term discount deposits for institutions, public enterprises, and cooperatives: Institutions, public enterprises, and cooperatives must submit an official letter stamped with a formal seal or chop to the bank for application. The account can be opened only after the bank has verified and approved it. The amount of deposit starts from a minimum of 100 standard physical units, with no limit to the maximum amount. The term is from ten days to one year. The interest rate is 2% per month for one month, increasing by 1% for each additional month, and calculated at 1% uniformly for nine months or more. No interest is calculated for less than one month.
