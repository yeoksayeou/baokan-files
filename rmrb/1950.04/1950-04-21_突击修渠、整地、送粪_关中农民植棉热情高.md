　　Crash Repairing Canals, Leveling Land, Delivering Manure
    Guanzhong Farmers Show High Enthusiasm for Planting Cotton
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] With the cotton planting season approaching, farmers in the Guanzhong area, a major cotton-producing region in Shaanxi Province, are rushing to repair canals, level land, and deliver manure in preparation for planting cotton. Last month, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and other departments dispatched a large number of cadres to rural areas in the Guanzhong region to publicize and explain the People's Government's policies to protect the interests of cotton farmers. Since then, the enthusiasm of farmers in the area for planting cotton has greatly increased, and they have begun to work in the fields. In Dali County, all cotton fields have been plowed once, and some have been plowed twice. In the Xegu District of Wugong County, all of the more than 8,000 mu of cotton fields have been plowed twice and have been fertilized for the first time. In Lintong County, more than 90% of the cotton fields have been fertilized, and more than 80% have been plowed for the first time. Due to the People's Government's encouragement of cotton planting, the area of cotton fields in various counties in Guanzhong is continuing to expand. In Chengguan District of Fuping County alone, the area has increased by more than 5,100 mu; in Jingzhong District of Jingyang County, the area has increased by more than 4,000 mu; and in Dali County, the area has increased by more than 38,000 mu. In order to ensure timely irrigation of cotton fields, water conservancy repairs are currently underway in various places. The Jinghui and Luhui canals can be put into operation after repairs. Chang'an County has started to repair the Lihui Canal. Other counties such as Xianyang, ?厔, and Lintong have also started to dredge canals and rivers within their borders. Yujin, Leyang, and other places have begun to irrigate cotton fields. Currently, district and township farmer representative meetings or village meetings are being widely held in Guanzhong to discuss cotton planting techniques and promote experiences and other specific issues.

　　突击修渠、整地、送粪
    关中农民植棉热情高
    【新华社西安十八日电】植棉时节就要到来，陕西省主要产棉地区关中各县农民正突击修渠、整地、送粪等植棉准备工作。上月陕西省人民政府农业厅等派遣大批干部深入关中地区农村，向农民宣传和解释人民政府保障棉农利益的政策之后，该区农民植棉热情大为提高，纷纷下地耕作。大荔县棉田已全部犁过一遍，且有一部分犁过两遍；武功县薛固区八千余亩棉田，已全部犁过两遍，并已上完头遍粪；临潼县棉田百分之九十以上已送完粪，百分之八十以上犁过头遍。由于人民政府奖励植棉，关中各县棉田面积正继续扩大。仅富平县城关区即扩大了五千一百多亩；泾阳县敬中区扩大了四千余亩；大荔县全县扩大了三万八千余亩。为了保证棉田的及时灌溉，各地现正进行水利整修工作。泾惠、洛惠两渠经整修后即可放水，长安县已动工整修澧惠渠，其他如咸阳、?厔、临潼等县亦开始进行疏浚境内水渠及河道，雨金、栎阳等地并已开始灌溉棉田。现在关中各地正在普遍召开区、乡农民代表会议或村民大会，讨论植棉技术和推广经验等各种具体问题。
