　　The Dredging Project of the Three Seas
　　Xiang Bo
　　On the North China Plain, lakes and swamps are scarce, but in Beijing, the air doesn't feel excessively dry, and temperature fluctuations aren't very drastic; the 864,000 square meters of water surface of Beihai, Zhonghai, and Nanhai do play a role in regulating air humidity. The Three Seas are artificial lakes expanded from a very small pond. The construction by the feudal rulers was not considered from the perspective of environmental hygiene but to embellish the scenery of the palace and for the enjoyment of a few. Today, the people have taken control of them—the Three Seas—and will use modern technology to make them exert a certain effect, better serving the health of the two million people in the capital.

　　The Three Seas also belong to the Yuquan Mountain river and lake system, entering the city through the Iron Railings Sluice and flowing into Beihai, Zhonghai, and Nanhai via Shichahai. Due to decades of neglect in dredging, both the upstream water supply channels and downstream drainage channels have become silted up, preventing sufficient water supply. The water surface of the Three Seas drops by ten centimeters every day during the peak evaporation in summer. The only water source is some rainwater during the rainy season, so the Three Seas have become a large stagnant pool. Because water plants such as lotuses are planted near the shore, the lake bottom has become increasingly shallow, and the decaying plants have turned the dry puddles into the best breeding grounds for mosquitoes—a source of infectious diseases, directly endangering the health of the people of Beijing. Last year's encephalitis outbreak in the city was found to be caused by mosquitoes from the Three Seas; therefore, the Beijing Municipal People's Government decided to dredge the Three Seas this year.

　　In the past, the water level of the Three Seas could not be raised partly due to the limitations of buildings. In this construction, in addition to deepening the seabed, part of the coastline will also be raised, so that the water depth at the edge of Zhongnanhai reaches 1.5 meters at the highest water level (water surface from the lake bottom), and the deep-water area in the center of the sea is 2.1 meters. Because Beihai is located upstream of the Three Seas and has a higher terrain, the longitudinal slope of the seabed is very steep. Therefore, the excavation method of the Beihai seabed is slightly different from that of Zhongnanhai, that is, the water depth at the shore is 1.4 meters, and the deep-water area is 2.0 meters. The stone revetments along the coast have been in disrepair for many years, or the foundations are too shallow, and after dredging the seabed, they are prone to collapse and will be repaired. Several sections of the earth bank, about ten kilometers long, in the Nanhai and Zhonghai areas, will be replaced with stone revetments. In order to adjust the water level of each sea and replace new water, the original dams are dilapidated and unfavorable for storage and discharge, and it has also been decided to repair or rebuild them into control gates. A rolling water dam will also be built under the Jin'ao Yubridge between Beihai and Zhonghai, so that when Beihai stores more water than the predetermined amount, it will automatically flow into Zhonghai, which not only saves labor but also avoids the siltation of the earth dam.

　　In order to complete this project before the rainy season, preparations began in February of this year. First, the drainage channels of the Three Seas, starting from the Rizhi Pavilion Sluice, through the Weaver Girl River, Yudai River, to the Yuhe dark ditch section at the east end of Changpu River, and the upstream water supply channels Jinhe River, Changhe River, and Northwest Moat were dredged. Along the Weaver Girl River, because the river slope could not be enlarged due to being tightly clamped by buildings on both sides, stone revetments were built to prevent scouring during water discharge. The Three Seas began to open the sluice gates to discharge water from March 11th, and by the end of March, all 1.46 million cubic meters of water stored in the Three Seas were drained. After five days of sun exposure, construction officially started from Beihai on April 6th. Currently, Zhonghai and Nanhai are also starting construction in sequence. It is estimated that the Three Seas will produce about 270,000 cubic meters of earth. Assuming each truck carries two cubic meters, and 200 trucks are used per day, with each truck making 13 trips per day, it will take 50 days to transport all the earth. The entire project is expected to be completed by mid-June.

### 三海的疏浚工程

　　三海的疏浚工程
    向勃
    在华北平原上，湖沼很少，但在北京并不感到空气过分干燥，气温变化也不甚剧烈；北海、中海、南海这八十六万四千平方公尺的水面确是起了调节空气湿度的作用。三海系由一极小的池塘扩大成的人工湖。当初封建统治者的兴建，并不是从环境卫生来考虑的，而是为了点缀宫庭的风景和供少数人的玩赏。今天人民掌握了它——三海，要用现代化的技术使它发挥一定效能，更好地来为首都二百万人民的健康服务。
    三海也是属于玉泉山河湖水系，由铁棂闸入城经什刹海流入北海、中海、南海。由于几十年来未经疏浚，上游供水渠及下游排水渠均已淤塞，不能充足供水，夏季蒸发量最大时三海水面每天要落下十公分。惟一的水源只是雨季容受一部雨水，因之三海变成了一个大的死水坑。由于靠岸附近又种植了荷花之类的水中植物，湖底就日益淤浅，再加上植物的腐烂，干涸地方的水洼便成了蚊虫繁殖的最好所在——传染病的发源地，直接危害着京市人民的健康。去年本市发现的大脑炎，据调查就是因三海蚊虫所致；为此，京市人民政府决定今年疏浚三海。
    过去三海水位不能提高也有部分原因是受了建筑物的限制，这次施工中除挖深海底外，并将一部海岸加高，使最高水位时达到中南海岸边水深至一公尺五（水面距湖底），海中央深水区为二公尺一。北海因位居三海上游，地势较高，海底纵坡度很陡，所以北海海底挖法也与中南海略异，即岸边水深一公尺四，深水区为二公尺。沿海之石护岸多已年久失修，或基础过浅，海底疏浚后，极易坍落，亦予整修。南海与中海区内长约十公里的数段土岸，则均改为石护岸。为了调剂各海水位及调换新水，原有闸坝均陈朽腐旧，不利蓄泄，也决予整修或改建为节制闸。并在北海与中海间，金鳌玉桥下筑一滚水坝，使北海贮水超过预定量时，自动流入中海，不单可节省人工，还可避免土坝的淤塞。
    为了争取雨季前完成这项工程，本年二月起即开始了准备工作。首将三海的排水渠自日知阁闸起经织女河、玉带河、至菖蒲河东头御河暗沟段及上游供水渠金河、长河、西北护城河进行疏浚。织女河沿岸，因被两岸建筑物紧夹，河坡无法放大，则修筑了石护岸，防止放水时冲刷。三月十一日起三海开始启闸放水，至三月底止三海贮水一百四十六万立方公尺全部放净，经五天晒晾，四月六日起自北海正式开工。现中海、南海也都依次动工。预计三海出土约二十七万余公方，以每辆卡车装两方，每天出车二百辆，每天每车拉十三次计，须五十天运完。全部工程于六月中旬即可竣工。
