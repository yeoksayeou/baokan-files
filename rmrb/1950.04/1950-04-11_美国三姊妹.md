　　The Three Sisters of America
    Saslavsky
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th, dispatch] Pravda published an exclusive article by the famous Soviet journalist Saslavsky entitled "The Three Sisters of America." The author reveals the close blood relationship between U.S. High Commissioner to West Germany, McCloy, West German "Chancellor" Adenauer, and U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, Douglas. Saslavsky points out that this kinship refers to the American Zinsser family, to be precise, John Sherman Zinsser, one of the heads of Wall Street. He cleverly arranged the marriages of his three sisters: Eileen to McCloy, Peggy to Douglas, and Gussie to Adenauer. His third brother-in-law was formerly a director of Deutsche Bank, later became unemployed, and is now the president of one of the most powerful banks in West Germany and also the West German Chancellor.
    Against the backdrop of this American family, we can see how American imperialists exert their power over the countries subordinate to them. One family rules the whole of West Germany. Of course, blood relations themselves would not have such great political significance if they were not guaranteed by capitalist kinship, which is fixed by the kinship of financial monopoly capital. The Zinsser family has the closest financial ties with the Morgan and DuPont families, and with Baruch and the deceased Forrestal. The brother, John Sherman Zinsser, is directly connected with Morgan, Peggy, through her husband (the Ambassador to Great Britain), is directly connected with Morgan's insurance company, Eileen, through McCloy, is directly connected with Gillette and the German trust Zollverein, and Gussie, through Adenauer, is directly connected with Deutsche Bank.
    From individuals, we can see how West Germany is being auctioned off to American Konzerns and American banks. Now, all the different enterprises of the Zinsser family have joined a unified organization to obtain German cannon fodder for new predatory wars.
    West Germany has not yet chosen a real name: the Allied Occupation Zone, the Tri-Zone, the Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, none of which is appropriate. The true name of West Germany is the Zinsser Kingdom – the paradise of the Zinsser family.

　　美国三姊妹
    萨斯拉夫斯基
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：真理报刊载苏联名记者萨斯拉夫斯基以《美国三姊妹》为题的专文。作者揭露美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃，西德“总理”阿登纳及美国驻英大使道格拉斯之间密切的血统关系。萨斯拉夫斯基指出：这种亲属关系是指美国金瑟家族，明白地说就是华尔街首脑之一——约翰·沙尔曼·金瑟。他巧妙地安排了他的三个妹妹的婚姻：爱琳嫁与麦克洛埃，佩琪嫁与道格拉斯，古茜嫁与阿登纳。他的第三个妹婿前为德意志银行董事，以后成为无业游民，现在又成为西德一家最雄厚的银行的总裁兼西德总理。
    在这个美国家庭的背景的衬托下，我们便看到了美帝国主义者如何把他们的力量施之于从属于他们的国家之中。一个家庭统治着整个西德。当然，血缘关系本身是不会有如此重大的政治意义的，如果它不是有资本主义精神的亲属联系做保证的话，而这种资本主义精神又为财政垄断资本的亲属联系所固定下来。金瑟家庭是和摩根与杜邦的家庭，和巴鲁区及死去的福莱斯特尔有最密切的金钱关系的。哥哥约翰·沙尔曼·金瑟是直接与摩根有联系的，佩琪经由她的丈夫（驻英大使）和摩根财团的保险公司发生直接联系，爱琳经由麦克洛埃与吉莱特公司及德国托辣斯佐仑维尔克公司、古茜经由阿登纳和德意志银行建立起直接联系。
    我们从个人就可以看出西德是怎样正被拍卖给美国康采伦和美国银行的。现在，金瑟家族的一切不同的企业，都已加入了一个统一的机构，以便取得德国炮灰来进行新的掠夺战争。
    西德还远没有选择到一个真正的名字：联占区、三联占区、德意志联邦、西部德意志，没有一个恰当的。西德真正的名称，乃是金瑟王国——金瑟家族的天堂。
