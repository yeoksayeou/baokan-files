　　The Tangshan Labor Daily reported on April 1st: The deadline for state-owned and public enterprises in Tangshan to pay their business tax for January and February of this year was March 31st. Most have paid in full on schedule. However, a few departments still have not paid on schedule according to the regulations of the Central Finance and Economics Commission. Some units have not even declared to the tax bureau, and have not paid after receiving notice from the tax bureau. Those who have paid their 1949 income tax and this year's January and February business tax include the Steel Plant, the Electricity Bureau, the Qixin Porcelain Factory, the Victory Printing Factory, and the Labor Bookstore. Those who have fully paid the business tax for January and February include the Oil Company, the Grain Company, the Cooperative Goods Station, the Tangshan Labor Daily Printing Factory, the Tangshan Iron Factory, and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, totaling 594,461,088 yuan (not including the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company), which has all been paid into the national treasury in full. Those who have been notified by the tax bureau but have not paid include the Xinhua Bookstore, the Native Produce Company, the Hebei Province Transportation Company, and the Dazhong Lumberyard. Those who have neither declared nor paid include the local People's Bank, and the Post Office. Those who have declared but have not yet been notified to pay include the Coal and Iron Company, the Department Store, the Telecommunications Bureau, Desheng, the Municipal Enterprise Company's Business Department and its affiliated Paper Making and Weaving and Dyeing Factories, and the Limin Cotton Ginning Factory. The reason for not notifying them is that the declarations were very late, and the business nature of some declaring units is complex, making it difficult to determine the tax rate, requiring the tax bureau to re-understand the situation. The phenomenon of not actively paying taxes is clearly manifested in units that have not declared or have declared late. Some units do not explain the declared business nature, and concurrently engage in other businesses, requiring the payment of temporary business tax, but still fill it all in on one form, fully demonstrating that they have not deeply studied the new tax law. Units that are not active in paying taxes adopt a wait-and-see attitude when they see that one company is not paying. This phenomenon must be corrected urgently. Units that have a full understanding of taxation and actively pay taxes, such as the Steel Plant, the Electricity Bureau, the Tangshan Labor Daily Printing Factory, and the Qixin Porcelain Factory, paid in full long before the deadline. The Tangshan Iron Factory and the Cooperative Goods Station not only completed the declaration but also paid the money on the same day, and these units are very enthusiastic about paying taxes. The tax bureau has now decided to order all state-owned and public enterprises that are late in paying the business tax for January and February to pay a late fee of 3% per day in accordance with the tax law, and to complete it within a limited time.

　　唐山市大部公营企业如期缴纳营业税
    少数部门抱观望态度，税局已令其增缴滞纳金。
    【本报讯】据唐山劳动日报四月一日消息：唐山市国营、公营企业缴纳本年度一、二月份营业税到三月三十一日为最后缴纳期限，大部分均已如数缴清，惟少数部门，仍未按照中央财经委员会规定如期缴纳，有的单位甚至未向税局申报，税局通知后也没有缴款。一九四九年所得税及今年一、二月份营业税已缴的，有制钢厂、电业局、启新磁厂、胜利印刷厂、劳动书店；缴足一、二月份营业税者，有油脂公司、粮食公司、合作货栈、唐山劳动报印刷厂、唐山铁工厂、花纱布公司，总数额五九四、四六一、○八八元（不包括花纱布公司），已全部如数缴入财政金库。税局已发出通知而未缴款的，有新华书店、土产公司、河北省运输公司、大众木栈；既未申报又未缴款的，有本市人民银行、邮局；申报还没有通知缴款的有煤铁公司、百货公司、电信局、德盛、市企业公司营业部及所属造纸、织染两厂、利民轧花厂等。没有通知的原因是由于申报很迟，有的申报单位营业性质复杂，税率不易订出，须税局重新了解。缴款不积极的现象，在未申报单位和迟申报单位表现得很清楚。有的单位对于申报的营业性质不加说明，兼营他业，须缴临时营业税，但仍然笼统填在一张表上，充分表现了对新税法没有加以深刻研究。凡对纳税不积极的单位，看到一个公司不缴时，就抱观望态度。此种现象，亟应纠正。纳税具有充分认识而且积极缴款的单位，如制钢厂、电业局、唐山劳动报印刷厂、启新磁厂等单位，在规定期限以前，老早就缴齐了，唐山铁工厂、合作货栈在一天之内，不但完成了申报，当天就缴了款，这些单位对缴纳税款都非常踊跃。现税局已决定令所有迟缴一、二月份营业税的国、公营企业，一律按税法逐日增缴滞缴金百分之三，并限期完成。
