Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 31st: Land reform work has been basically completed in seven counties of Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, including Baofeng, Jiaxian, Xiangcheng, Lushan, Linru, Yuxian, and Yexian. The broad countryside has taken on a completely new look, undergoing tremendous changes in the political, economic, and cultural spheres. The emancipated peasant masses are now enthusiastically engaged in the great production movement.

Since the autumn of 1948, these seven counties have successively undergone bandit suppression, anti-local tyrant, and rent reduction movements. The feudal ruling forces of bandits and local tyrants in the countryside have been basically crushed. The feudal exploitation of the landlord class has also been largely or partially weakened through the rent reduction movement. After more than a year of struggle, the political consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been generally raised. At the same time, peasant associations have been established in various places, with peasant association members accounting for about 40 percent of the total population. Through the training and testing of practical movements, a large number of rural cadres with experience in struggle have been cultivated in various places, and people's democratic power has been generally established in the countryside. Communist Party organizations have been established in more than 90 percent of the villages. Most of the Communist Party members are peasant leaders with firm stances, active work, and enthusiastic support from the broad masses of peasants, serving as the leading core of the peasant movement. Last summer, based on the above situation, the Provincial People's Government of Henan believed that the area was ready to carry out land distribution. It promptly proposed the policy of implementing land distribution and completely eliminating the feudal exploitation system in the countryside. Since the initial trial implementation in seven townships in Baofeng and Jiaxian counties in July achieved results, the Provincial People's Government carried out land distribution experiments in twenty-eight districts of the above-mentioned seven counties in September, in order to learn from experience and guide the large-scale land distribution reform movement throughout the province in the future.

The Land Distribution Movement Developed Smoothly Through Four Steps

When carrying out land distribution, various localities first convened people's representative conferences at the county level and peasant representative conferences at the county, district, and township levels to discuss and adopt the land distribution policy and various specific implementation steps, thereby consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front in the countryside, isolating and disintegrating the feudal landlord class, and promoting the smooth development of the land distribution movement. After the start of the movement, various localities generally went through the following working steps: First, widely publicize the land reform policy and conduct specific investigations into class relations and land distribution in various villages. Second, in order to rectify the peasant ranks, in accordance with the policy of "relying on poor peasants and farm laborers and consolidating the unity of middle peasants," extensively mobilize the broad masses of peasants, improve and rectify rural peasant associations, rural governments, and militia organizations. At the same time, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also made the Party's organizations in the countryside public, widely solicited the opinions of the masses, strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses, and improved the Party's work. Third, classify classes and carry out reasoned struggles. This was an important key in the land distribution movement. In order to ensure that the class classification was correct, various localities first adopted the method of recounting grievances and digging out the roots of poverty to enlighten the peasants' class consciousness and distinguish class boundaries; then, mass meetings for class classification were held, and the method of "self-reporting, public discussion, and three postings for final decision" was adopted to conduct repeated discussions and evaluations, and finally submitted to the district people's government for approval and implementation. Fourth, distribute land. Villages in various counties where land distribution has been completed will carry out the improvement of various rural organizations, issue land certificates, determine land rights, and enable peasants to promptly transfer to the great production movement.

After this land reform movement in Baofeng and other seven counties, the vast countryside has undergone tremendous changes in the economic, political, and cultural aspects. As a result of the thorough abolition of the feudal land ownership system that has existed for thousands of years and the realization of the system of land to the tiller, significant changes have taken place in the rural class situation. Poor peasants now own a certain amount of land and have been allocated a portion of agricultural tools, livestock, and other means of production. According to the statistics of Li Shuzhuang in Ciguo District, Xiangcheng, there were originally 124 poor peasant and farm laborer households with 475 people in the whole village. Before liberation, they had 760 mu of land. After this land distribution, the poor peasants and farm laborers were allocated more than 700 mu of land and 15 draught animals. Now each person has an average of more than 3 mu of land. Yang Guanbao, a poor peasant in Yanggou Village, Baofeng County, had no land before. This time, his family was allocated 21 mu of land.

Peasants' Enthusiasm for Production Soars After Receiving Land and Other Means of Production

After the broad masses of peasants were allocated land and some other means of production, their enthusiasm for production soared unprecedentedly. Under the leadership of the local people's governments, they formulated production plans, organized mutual aid teams, and enthusiastically engaged in digging rivers and opening canals, accumulating fertilizer, hoeing wheat, and spring plowing movements. A peasant from Wang Village, Sixth District of Jia County, which was originally a tenant farming village, said happily after being allocated land: "Chairman Mao led us to distribute the land. We must do a good job to show Chairman Mao." After the land reform, the peasants of Xuedian Township in the county also discussed: "Small trees couldn't grow under big trees in the past, and we didn't have good days; now that we have been allocated land, we can only blame ourselves if we are still poor." Before the land reform, some middle peasants in various places were afraid of being struggled against and did not dare to concentrate on production. After the practical education of resolutely not touching the middle peasants in this land distribution, their ideological concerns have been eliminated, and they are actively participating in production. Currently, a surge of production competition is unfolding between villages and between households in the seven counties. In order to better develop production, the people's governments of various counties held people's representative conferences at the county level after the land distribution, conducted detailed discussions and research on production, famine relief, and spring plowing issues, and decided to strive to complete the task of increasing grain production in 1950. Yexian has formulated a full-year agricultural and sideline production plan, striving to restore the pre-War of Resistance against Japan agricultural production level within one year.

Because the policy of protecting industry and commerce was resolutely implemented in the land reform, and appropriate compensation was also made for some industry and commerce that had been infringed upon in the past, industrialists and businessmen have dispelled their concerns and have begun to operate boldly, making various towns gradually turn to prosperity. Taking Jiaxian as an example, after the land reform, the county increased by 16 industrial households and 128 commercial households.

Nearly 20,000 Advanced Peasants Join the Party and the League, and the Number of Members of the Farmers' Association Reaches 900,000

The political awareness of the peasants in various places has been generally improved in the movement of land distribution. After overthrowing the old feudal rule, they have gradually established a consolidated people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside, and the various democratic classes in the countryside have reached an unprecedentedly close unity. The organized peasant ranks, as the foundation of the rural people's democratic dictatorship, have gained rapid development and growth. According to the preliminary statistics of the seven counties, the members of the peasant association have reached more than 908,400 people, the militia armed force is more than 51,200 people, and the organizations of the Communist Party and the branches of the Communist Youth League have been established in 1,218 villages. About 11,800 peasants who have been tested in the struggle are willing to dedicate themselves to the cause of communism and have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. About 7,400 excellent young peasants have been absorbed as members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. In total, the organized masses in the seven counties, including only the Farmers' Association, Militia, Women's Federation (excluding Young Pioneers, teachers, students, trade unions, etc.), account for more than 50 percent of the total population.

The peasants after the land reform have not only turned over economically and politically, but have also gradually launched a movement to learn culture. According to incomplete statistics from Baofeng County alone, 45 winter schools have been opened in the county, and about 5,000 young men and women have participated in the study. Thirty-two townships in Jiaxian have also established women's literacy classes. Other rural drama troupes, yangko teams, and other cultural and entertainment activities have also begun to become the entertainment that peasants like in their spare time, just as Li Dong, a poor peasant in Yaozhuang, Third District of Jiaxian, said: "In the past, we were worried about food and clothing all year round, and we didn't have the mind to have fun. Now we have turned over and have land, and after we do a good job in production, we should be happy when we have free time!"

　　河南许昌专区七个县
    土地改革工作基本完成
    广大农民热烈投入大生产运动
    【新华社汉口三十一日电】河南省许昌专区宝丰、郏县、襄城、鲁山、临汝、禹县、叶县等七县土地改革工作已基本完成，广大农村面貌已焕然一新，在政治、经济和文化各方面都起了巨大的变化，翻身后的农民群众现正热烈投入大生产运动中。
    这七个县自一九四八年秋起曾接连经过了清匪、反恶霸和减租运动，农村中土匪、恶霸的封建统治势力已被基本上打垮；地主阶级的封建剥削，经过减租运动后，也被削弱了大部或一部；广大农民经过一年多的斗争，政治觉悟已普遍提高，同时各地并建立了农民协会的组织，农会会员已占全人口的百分之四十左右。经过实际运动的锻炼和考验，各地培养出了大批具有斗争经验的农村干部，并普遍建立了农村中的人民民主政权。百分之九十以上的村庄，均建立了共产党的组织，共产党员大多是立场坚定、工作积极、为广大农民群众所热烈拥护的农民领袖，为农民运动的领导核心。去年夏天，该省人民政府根据以上情况，认为该地已经具备了进行分配土地的条件，便适时地提出了实行分配土地、彻底消灭农村中的封建剥削制度的方针。自去年七月经在宝丰、郏县等七个乡初步试行获得成绩后，该省人民政府又于九月在上述七县二十八个区进行了分配土地的实验工作，以便吸取经验，指导今后全省大规模的分配土地的改革运动。
    分配土地运动经过四个步骤顺利发展
    各地在进行分配土地时，首先召开了县的各界人民代表会议及县、区、乡各级农民代表会议，讨论并通过分配土地的政策和各项具体实施步骤，因而巩固和扩大了农村中的人民民主统一战线，孤立与分化了封建地主阶级，促进了分配土地运动的顺利发展。运动开始后，各地大体上都经过了以下几个工作步骤：第一，广泛宣传土地改革政策，具体调查各村阶级关系和土地分布状况。第二，为整顿农民队伍，按照“依靠贫雇农，巩固团结中农”的方针，深入发动广大农民，健全与整顿乡村农民协会、乡村政权及民兵等组织。同时，中共河南省委并将农村中党的组织公开，广泛征求群众的意见，密切了党与群众的联系，并改进了党的工作。第三，划分阶级，开展说理斗争。这是分配土地运动中的重要关键。为了使阶级划得正确，各地首先采取诉苦挖穷根的方式，启发农民的阶级觉悟，分清阶级界线；然后召开划分阶级的群众大会，采取“自报公议、三榜定案”的方法，进行反复讨论评定，最后交由区人民政府批准执行。第四，分配土地。各县分配土地已经完毕的村庄，即进行健全农村等各种组织，颁发土地证，确定地权，使农民及时地转入了大生产运动。
    宝丰等七县经过这次土地改革运动，广大农村在经济、政治和文化等各方面都起了巨大的变化。由于彻底废除了几千年来的封建性的土地所有制，实现了耕者有其田制度的结果，农村阶级状况已发生重大变化。贫农现在已经拥有一定数量的土地，并分得了一部分农具、牲畜等项生产资料。据襄城茨沟区李树庄的统计，全村原有贫农雇农一百二十四户，四百七十五人，在解放前，他们原有土地七百六十亩，经过这次分配土地后，贫农雇农共分得了七百多亩的土地和十五条耕畜，现每人平均已有三亩多土地。宝丰县杨沟村贫农杨官保一家五口人，过去没有一亩土地。这次他家共分得土地二十一亩。
    农民分得土地和其他生产资料后生产情绪高涨
    广大农民在分得了土地和一部分其他生产资料之后，生产情绪空前高涨，在各地人民政府领导下，纷纷订出生产计划，组织变工互助，并投入热烈的挖河开渠、积肥、锄麦和春耕运动。原为佃农村的郏县六区王村的一位农民在分得土地以后高兴地说：“毛主席领导咱分了地，咱一定得干个样给毛主席看看。”该县薛店乡农民在土地改革后，也纷纷议论说：“早先大树底下长不起小树，没有咱过的好日子；如今分了地，再受穷可要怨自己了。”在土地改革前，各地曾有些中农害怕被斗争，不敢安心生产，经过这次分配土地中坚决不动中农的实际教育，现在已消除了思想顾虑，积极参加生产。现七个县农村中正展开村与村和户与户的生产竞赛热潮。各县人民政府为了更好地发展生产，分别在分配土地后召开县各界人民代表会议，对生产渡荒和春耕问题进行了详细的讨论研究，决定努力完成一九五○年增加粮食生产的任务。叶县已制订出全年的农业和副业生产计划，争取于一年内恢复抗战前的农业生产水平。
    由于土地改革中坚决执行了保护工商业的政策，对于过去某些被侵犯的工商业也作了适当的补偿，工商业者解除顾虑后，已开始大胆经营，使各个城镇逐渐转向繁荣。以郏县为例，土地改革后全县增加工业十六户，商业一百二十八户。
    将近两万先进农民入党入团农协会员达九十万
    各地农民在分配土地的运动中，政治觉悟已普遍提高。他们在推翻了旧的封建统治之后，已经逐步地建立了巩固的农村人民民主专政，农村中各个民主阶层已达到空前的紧密团结。作为农村人民民主专政基础的有组织的农民队伍，更获得了迅速的发展和壮大。据七个县的初步统计，农民协会会员已达九十万八千四百余人，民兵武装为五万一千二百余人，一千二百十八个村庄内已建立了共产党的组织与青年团的支部，约有一万一千八百余名经过斗争考验的农民，愿献身于共产主义事业，光荣地参加了中国共产党；约有七千四百余名优秀的青年农民被吸收为中国新民主主义青年团的团员。总计该七县有组织的群众，仅农会、民兵、妇女会（少年儿童队、教员、学生、工会等尚未统计在内），即达总人口的百分之五十以上。
    土地改革后的农民，不但在经济上、政治上翻了身，同时并逐渐展开了学习文化的运动。仅据宝丰县不完全的统计，全县已开办冬学四十五处，参加学习的青年男女约有五千人。郏县也有三十二个乡创设了妇女识字班。其他农村剧团、秧歌队等文化娱乐活动，也已开始成为农民生产余暇时间所喜好的娱乐，正如郏县三区姚庄贫农李东所说的：“过去咱整年愁吃愁穿，那有心思玩乐。现在咱们翻身有地啦，搞好生产以后，有了空闲就应该高兴高兴！”
