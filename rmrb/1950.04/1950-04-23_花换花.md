　　Flower for Flower

　　The moon hangs on the willow branches,
　　Under the willow shade, weaving braids; (Note 1)
　　Two sisters shoulder to shoulder,
　　Whispering their thoughts:

　　"The little swallows in the sky fly in pairs,
　　The wild geese in the滩 are paired up.
　　You and your brother-in-law are engaged,
　　It's been over a year and nothing's been mentioned.
　　He's counted among the militia班,
　　You're counted among the sister团;
　　Chosen from thousands, picked from ten thousands,
　　Your hearts are set on each other.
　　The ‘self-selected’ (Note 2) marriage is deeply affectionate,
　　Both families agree;
　　Who would have thought that after your engagement,
　　Your work enthusiasm would increase even more;
　　Brother-in-law leads the mutual aid team,
　t resting at noon;
　　You lead us in weaving braids,
　　So busy you forget to eat.
　　The whole village is looking forward to drinking wedding wine,
　　You've postponed it several times;
　　The melons fall to the ground unpicked,
　　What are you two planning?"

　　"This year we're launching a great production campaign,
　　We'll be selecting models after the autumn harvest;
　　Water flows low, people strive high,
　　Who doesn't want to be a champion?
　　Youth League members are taking the lead,
　　Your brother-in-law and I have taken up the challenge;
　　Determined to take the lead,
　　Just waiting to win the model title in the fall.
　　Selected by the village, selected by the district,
　t sent to the county with fanfare;
　　Sitting side by side at the labor model conference,
　　Two red flowers hanging on our chests;
　　Green leaves swaying in the wind,
　　Bright red flowers shining on our faces.
　　The young people take us as examples,
　　Gesturing and making vows.
　　The hero's wine becomes a heart-to-heart wine,
　　The celebration banquet becomes a wedding banquet.
　　The county magistrate and the county party committee come to witness the marriage,
　　We want to exchange flowers to wear on our chests!"
　　(Note 1) Weaving straw hat braids is a common sideline for women in the northern plains.
　　(Note 2) In the rural areas of the northern plains, autonomous marriage is called "self-selected."

　　花换花
    月亮挂在杨柳枝，
    柳荫底下掏缏子；（注一）
    姐妹二人肩靠肩，
    悄声悄语谈心思：
　
    “天上的小燕成对飞，
    滩里的大雁配对对。
    你和姐夫订了婚，
    拖了年把再不提。
    民兵班里数着他，
    姊妹团里数着你；
    千人里挑来万人里拣，
    你两人心思到一起。
    ‘自选’（注二）的亲事情意深，
    两家大人又同意；
    谁想到你们订了婚，
    工作的劲头更加足；
    姐夫领导互助组，
    歇晌的时候不休息；
    你领导我们掏缏子，
    忙得忘了把饭吃。
    全庄上盼着喝喜酒，
    你们几番来延迟；
    甜瓜落蛋不去摘，
    你们打的啥主意？”
　
    “今年开展大生产，
    秋后就要选模范；
    水流低来人走高，
    那一个不想当状元？
    青年团员打先锋，
    我和你姐夫挑了战；
    立下决心带头干，
    单等秋天夺模范。
    村里选来区里选，
    吹吹打打送到县；
    劳模会上并排坐，
    两朵红花胸上悬；
    绿盈盈叶子随风摆，
    红艳艳鲜花照人眼。
    青年们拿着当榜样，
    比手划脚立誓愿。
    英雄酒变成交心酒，
    庆功筵变成结婚筵。
    县长县委来证婚，
    我们要花换花来带胸前！”
    （注一）掏草帽缏子是平原北部普遍的妇女副业。
    （注二）在平原北部农村，自主婚姻叫“自选”。
