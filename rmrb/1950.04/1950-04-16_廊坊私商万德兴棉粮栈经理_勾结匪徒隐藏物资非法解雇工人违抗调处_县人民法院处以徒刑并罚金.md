　　Langfang Private Merchant Wan Dexing Cotton and Grain Depot Manager
    Colludes with Bandits to Hide Supplies, Illegally Dismisses Workers, and Violates Mediation
    County People's Court Sentences Him to Imprisonment and Fines
    [Reported by this newspaper] Zhou Xinfu (private merchant), the manager of Wan Dexing Cotton and Grain Depot in Langfang Town, Anci County, Tianjin Prefecture, hid enemy and puppet supplies that were being evacuated, engaged in speculation and profiteering by illegally moving funds, illegally exploited and dismissed workers, and refused to execute court judgments. After trial by the Anci County People's Court, he was sentenced to three and a half years of imprisonment and fined 300 shi of corn. During the period of enemy puppet and Chiang Kai-shek bandit rule, the criminal colluded with Han Xihou, the captain of the puppet security army and military police, Zhou Yaxuan, the secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit county party headquarters, and Wang Xingwu, the county magistrate, to engage in speculation and profiteering. Bandits stored a large amount of materials there. After liberation, Zhou Xinfu not only did not hand over the materials to the people's government, but secretly colluded with the underground henchmen of the bandits and assisted them with materials. Fearing that the shop assistants who knew the inside story would report to the government, he dismissed Zhang Zuotao, Li Dehua, Zhang Zhanhua and three other people for no reason. Later, he stopped Sun Changrong, a cotton ginning worker, for no reason. Although the town government mediated many times, he still refused to comply. Later, the court ruled that Sun and others should be reinstated. Zhou Xinfu cunningly asked his adopted son, Liu Fusheng, to write a "request letter" and coerced other workers to put their fingerprints on it to fabricate public opinion and resist execution. After that, Zhou Xinfu hid in Beijing to avoid meeting.
    Since liberation, although the government has repeatedly clarified the policies on industry, commerce, labor, and capital, Zhou gradually transferred the funds of 100 shi of corn and 15 tons of cotton to Qinhuangdao, Shalingzi and other places. On the one hand, he falsely claimed that business was not good to evade taxes. On the other hand, he engaged in grain speculation and trading in those places. He severely exploited the workers, not only delaying the payment of wages but also attempting to stop female workers under the pretext of insufficient raw materials, and increasing the workload of male workers by assigning them all the work. This illegal behavior was not only unanimously opposed by the working class but also criticized by the business community. Recently, he was finally reported by shop assistants and apprentices, and more than 60 pieces of enemy and bandit supplies such as clothes and furniture, as well as 130 rounds of automatic rifle bullets, were taken from his home. For this reason, the Anci People's Court sentenced him to three and a half years of imprisonment; in addition to fully repaying the illegally owed wages to the workers, he was fined 300 shi of medium-grade corn to maintain the law and discipline and warn against treachery.

　　廊坊私商万德兴棉粮栈经理
    勾结匪徒隐藏物资非法解雇工人违抗调处
    县人民法院处以徒刑并罚金
    【本报讯】天津专区安次县廊坊镇万德兴棉粮栈经理周新甫（私商），隐藏疏散敌伪物资，投机倒把外流资金，非法剥削与解雇工人，并对法院判决抗不执行，经安次县人民法院审理，判处其有期徒刑三年半，并罚金玉米三百市石。该犯在敌伪、蒋匪统治时期，曾与伪治安军宪兵队长韩锡厚，蒋匪县党部书记周雅轩、县长王醒吾等勾结，投机倒把，匪徒们曾在该处存放大批物资；解放后，周新甫不但不把物资交给人民政府，反暗中与匪徒地下爪牙勾结，并以物资相助。因害怕知悉内情的店员向政府报告，无故解雇张作涛、李德华、张占华等三人；后又无故停歇轧花工人孙长荣。虽经镇公所多次调处，仍抗不执行，再后由法院判决孙等复工，周新甫狡猾地令其义子刘福生写“请求书”，并要挟其他工友盖手印，伪造民意抗拒执行。此后该周新甫更躲住北京避不见面。
    解放以来，政府虽多次阐明工商与劳资政策，周犯却把百石玉米和十五吨棉花的资金逐渐抽去秦皇岛、沙岭子等地，一面伪言营业不佳，逃避税收，另一面则于该地做粮食投机买卖。对工人则苛重剥削，不但拖延发工资，并借口原料不足，企图停歇女工，而以全部工作加重男工身上。这种非法行为，不仅遭到工人阶级的一致反对，同时亦遭到了工商界的指责。最近终于为店友工徒们告发，并从他家取出敌匪物资衣服家具等六十余件，自动步枪子弹一百三十发。为此，安次人民法院特判处其有期徒刑三年半；除如数偿还非法亏欠工人之应得工资外，并罚款中等玉米三百市石，以维法纪，而戒奸宄。
