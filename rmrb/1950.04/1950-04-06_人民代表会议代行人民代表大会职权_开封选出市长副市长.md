Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th - The Second First Session of the Kaifeng Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles was held from the 27th of last month to the 1st of this month. A total of 359 representatives attended. With the approval of the Henan Provincial People's Government, this conference exercised the functions and powers of the Municipal People's Congress, elected the mayor, deputy mayors, and committee members, and established the Kaifeng Municipal People's Government Committee. The conference also heard reports from the person in charge of the Kaifeng Municipal People's Government on the government work of Kaifeng City for one year and five months, the production and employment plan of Kaifeng City from April to June this year, and the suggestions of Dai Jiying, Secretary of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the work of Kaifeng City in 1950. The conference resolved to take Dai Jiying's suggestion report as the policy guideline for the Kaifeng Municipal People's Government this year. In addition, the conference elected Dai Jiying and more than 60 others as members of the Kaifeng Municipal Second Session of the People's Representative Conference Consultation Committee. The people of Kaifeng celebrated the success of this conference by universally hanging five-star national flags throughout the city.
　　
Prior to this conference, Kaifeng City had held twelve People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the past year. In these twelve conferences, major tasks such as clearing bandits and secret agents, supporting the front lines, restoring and developing production, connecting urban and rural relations, and stabilizing prices were discussed successively. The representatives put forward a total of 1,278 proposals in the previous conferences. After these proposals were carefully reviewed and discussed by the representative conference and resolutions were made, they were adopted and implemented by various departments of the People's Government and other relevant parties, achieving considerable results. At the same time, the frequent convening of the representative conference has made the connection between the government and the people and the unity between the democratic classes and social organizations increasingly close and consolidated.
