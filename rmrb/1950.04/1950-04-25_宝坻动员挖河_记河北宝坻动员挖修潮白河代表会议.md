　　Baodi Mobilizes to Dig a River
    A Record of the Representative Conference for Mobilizing Baodi, Hebei, to Dredge and Repair the Chaohe River
    By Our Correspondent Lin Chi
    To save the counties of Ninghe, Baodi, Jixian, and Yutian in eastern Hebei from the irresistible water damage of the Chaohe River year after year, the Hebei Provincial Government decided to begin digging a new Chaohe River channel on April 10th. The broad masses of Baodi said, "This is something we've waited for eternally, only the People's Government can remove this great scourge for the people." However, in the 51 villages where the river occupies land, the 92 villages in the 50-li basin, which become a reservoir lake during the flood season, and the 14 villages west of the Qinglongwan River, which become a swimming pool, the greatest concerns of the masses here are: how to survive after the wheat fields are dug up and turned into a reservoir lake? For this reason, the Baodi County Government specially convened representative conferences for the villages in the reservoir lake area, river-occupied land area, and swimming pool area in separate groups in late March.

    When the representatives of each village heard Deputy Commissioner Li (of the Tianjin Prefecture) explain the shape of the new Chaohe River after it was dug, due to differing interests and varying degrees of understanding, three viewpoints emerged. Most representatives were concerned about digging up wheat fields and graves, or neither being able to silt up land nor having to accumulate water year-round, and strongly opposed digging the river. Another group of representatives believed that digging the river would be beneficial in the long run, but that their current lives were very difficult and they were willing to wait two or three years, until they were more prosperous, to dig the river. A portion of representatives said, "In the past, liberation was a political transformation, now digging the river is an economic transformation, and this is beneficial to the majority of the people." They actively supported digging the river. The conference tightly grasped the above different ideological situations and repeatedly explained that the government would provide appropriate solutions for the affected villages and households, but it was also necessary to think about the overall situation. At the meeting, under the leadership of Communist Party members, they further found ways to produce and live through careful calculations, and the representatives became relaxed and happy. Wang Shuzhi, the cadre of Bataijiang Village in the Sixth District, said, "We must look at things from a long-term perspective. My family of five has 30 mu of land, and digging the river will take up 16 mu of my wheat field, but I am also very happy. Don't look at the fact that there is less land now, but the harvest after digging the river will not be less than my 30 mu of land, because it will no longer be flooded, it can also silt up land, and you can irrigate the land and plant gardens near the river."

    The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance. The temporarily affected masses were able to think about the overall situation, and the broad masses who benefited were also able to provide great support to the victims.

    Zhang Baofang, a member of the Shigezhuang branch, sincerely said, "Our village has not had its land occupied by the river, but we can allocate a part of the land. When moving graves, our village will help with manpower and materials."

    The meeting educated each representative and made them understand more about "relying on water to govern fish," actively leading the masses to engage in production to overcome the current difficulties in life. As Yu Chengshan, the representative of Hulugou in the Ninth District, said, "We must think about the overall situation. Although we have increased some difficulties here, as long as the cadres lead the masses to actively think of ways to engage in production, we will have food to eat. Last year was a flood that had not been seen in more than ten years. Under the support of the government, our village raised funds to organize a winter fishing team. The whole village had no worries about food and drink all winter. Since the spring fishing season, we have earned 30 shi of red grain. Women and children earned 20 shi by weaving nets. A small village with more than 300 people earned 10,000 jin of red grain in less than a month."

　　宝坻动员挖河
    记河北宝坻动员挖修潮白河代表会议
    本报通讯员  林池
    为免除冀东宁河、宝坻、蓟县、玉田等县连年遭受潮白河不可抗拒的水害，河北省府决定于四月十日动工挖潮白新河一道。宝坻广大群众都说：“这是万古千秋盼不到的，只有人民政府才能为民除掉这大患。”但是在五十一个村庄里有河占地，方圆五十里地的九十二个村庄盆地，汛期变为蓄水湖，青龙湾河西之十四个村庄变为游水池。在这里的群众最大的顾虑是：挖掉麦地，变为蓄水湖后如何活下去？为此，宝坻县府特于三月下旬，分片召开了蓄水湖、河占地、游水池地区各村代表会议。
    当各村代表听取了李副专员（天津专署）具体讲解挖潮白新河形后，因利害不同认识程度不一，出现了三种看法，多数代表顾虑挖掉麦地、坟地，或既不能淤地，又得常年积水，而极力反对挖河。另一部代表认为从长远着想，挖河是有好处的，但眼下生活就很困难，愿再等二、三年，富足些了再挖河。一部分代表说：“过去解放是政治翻身，现在挖河是经济翻身，这是对大多数人民有利益的。”积极拥护挖河。会议紧紧抓住了以上不同的思想情况，反复说明政府对受害村、户要给予适当的解决，但是也必须要从全面着想。会议中在共产党员的带动下，进而从精打细算中找出了生产生活门路，各代表才轻松愉快起来。六区八台江村干王树芝说：“看事得从远处着眼，我全家五口人有三十亩地，挖河得占去我十六亩麦地，可是我也很高兴，不要看当下地少了，可是挖河后的收成比我这三十亩地少不了，因为不再被淹，又可淤地，靠近河道又可以浇地种园子。”
    会议上充满了团结互助的气氛，暂时受害群众能为全面着想，而广大得利群众也能给受害者以极大的支援。
    史各庄支部委员张保芳诚挚地说：“俺村没被河占了地，可调剂出一部土地，移坟时俺村帮助出人力物力。”
    会议教育了每个代表，更懂得了“靠水治鱼”，积极领导群众搞起生产渡过目前生活上的困难。正如九区葫芦沽代表喻成山说：“要从全面着想，咱们这里虽然增加了些困难，可是干部领导群众积极想法搞起生产，就有饭吃，去年是十几年来没有的水灾，俺村在政府扶植下，集资入股组织起冬网班，全村一冬没愁吃喝。打春网以来，挣了三十石红粮。妇女小孩织网挣了二十石。共三百多人口的小村，不到一个月就赚来一万斤红粮。”
