Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 16th: "Armed Poland" newspaper published an editorial stating: The events that occurred before the "Exilona" carrying US arms arrived in Naples, once again revealed the extreme fragility of the war vendor group. After the painful experience of the Dixmude - a ship that European and North African dockworkers prevented from unloading for nearly a month - the US war vendors wanted their Italian lackeys to guarantee the unloading of the "Exilona". However, their attempt to prevent the working masses from expressing their determination to demand peace, and to prevent the working masses from holding warning strikes and demonstrations against the war vendors, failed.

Not only in Naples, where the army was forced to protect American ships, but the same thing happened in all ports of European countries sold out to the United States by traitorous governments. The statement that "the army was forced to" is fully justified, because there are more and more cases where soldiers in the armies of Marshallized countries refuse to take action against their worker brothers and fathers when carrying out shameful orders.

The newspaper then mentioned the case of the French soldier Vedie, who was sentenced to four months in prison for participating in activities to defend peace. The newspaper pointed out: Tens of thousands of French, Italian, Belgian, and Dutch soldiers sympathize with what Vedie did. The masses demonstrating in front of the Toulouse court demanding Vedie's release not only expressed the will of the French people, but also the will of the people of the world.

### 美国军火到处碰壁  战贩集团阴谋失败  波报赞扬西欧工人反美帝斗争

　　美国军火到处碰壁  战贩集团阴谋失败
    波报赞扬西欧工人反美帝斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】波兰通讯社华沙十四日讯：“武装的波兰”报发表社论称：装着美国军火的“爱克齐隆娜号”到达那不勒斯之前所发生的事件，再度显露了战争贩子集团的极端脆弱。经过狄克西姆德号——这艘船为欧洲与北非码头工人阻止卸货几达一个月之久——的痛苦经验以后，美国战争贩子们要他们的意大利奴才保障“爱克齐隆娜”号卸货。然而，他们企图阻止劳动群众表示要求和平的决心，阻止劳动群众举行反对战争贩子的警告性罢工和示威的企图是失败了。
    不但在那不勒斯，军队被迫去保护美国船只，同样的事情也发生在那些被卖国政府出卖给美国的欧洲国家的一切港口。“军队被迫去”的说法是完全有根据的，因为马歇尔化国家军队中的士兵，在执行可耻的命令时拒绝对他们的工人弟兄和父亲们采取行动的情形，是愈来愈多了。
    该报于是提起那个因参加保卫和平的活动而被判处四个月徒刑的法国士兵卫迪耶的案件。该报指出：有成万法国、意大利、比利时和荷兰的士兵们，对卫迪耶所做的事情抱有同感。在土鲁斯法院门前举行示威要求释放卫迪耶的群众们，不但表示了法国人民大众的意志，并且也表示了全世界人民大众的意志。
