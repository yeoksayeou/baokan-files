The American Agricultural Crisis and Agricultural Dumping
by Labov, translated by Chen Fengwen

The American agricultural crisis is developing at such a rapid pace that even the "big" American newspapers can no longer ignore the complexities caused by the lack of sufficient effective demand for massive agricultural products. Not too long ago, the American agricultural outlook was depicted as dazzling, but now even official Department of Agriculture publications say that the rapid increase in agricultural surpluses and the sharp decline in exports have made the situation extremely serious.

The New York Herald Tribune stated: "The American agricultural commodity market shows abnormal signs of the increasing enormous inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation."

Barron's Weekly presented the following figures, indicating the "surplus" held by the Commodity Credit Corporation (a government-owned monopoly that engages in the buying, selling, lending, and exporting of agricultural products): four million bales of cotton, 192 million bushels of wheat, 404 million pounds of linseed oil, over 100 million pounds of butter, 50 million pounds of cheese, 70 million pounds of dried eggs, etc.

The weekly is extremely pessimistic about the export prospects. The Department of Agriculture still expects to export 375 million bushels of wheat (thus admitting that the official projected export of 450 million bushels "plan" is unfounded), but Barron's Weekly believes that exports will hardly exceed 310 million bushels. This can be compared with the export of 502 million bushels of wheat in the 1948-49 agricultural year.

The New York Times estimates that along with the continuous decline in domestic agricultural consumption, the value of American agricultural exports this year will decrease by a huge amount of $500 million.

The government's policy of maintaining agricultural prices—the result of which is that the Commodity Credit Corporation has accumulated huge unsalable surpluses—is being fiercely attacked by the newspapers controlled by the industrial and banking monopolists.

The "Monthly Newsletter" of Citibank stated:
"The Commodity Credit Corporation's net expenditure, mainly to maintain agricultural prices, is currently estimated at approximately $1.4 billion, or $800 million higher than last January... During the 1948-49 fiscal year, the Commodity Credit Corporation reported operating losses of $600 million (instead of the $106 million projected in January 1948 - Labov). The serious expansion of price maintenance activities not only keeps food prices higher than they should be but also imposes a heavy financial burden on the national treasury and causes budget deficits."

The New York Times also hurriedly stated:
"Due to the huge surplus of agricultural products accumulated by the U.S. government as a result of price maintenance activities, some fear that the current agricultural plan is failing."

Such outspoken assessments of the American agricultural situation seem quite surprising at first glance. But the explanation is simple: With the approach of the economic crisis, maintaining agricultural prices has aroused increasing resentment among industrial monopolists. The competition for government subsidies has led monopolists in various industries to reveal some painful truths about the American economic situation, and some inside "secrets" have been blurted out.

"The current agricultural policy," the New York Times stated, "is also considered a policy that gradually eliminates small farmers."

Only the enthusiasm of the debate has driven the New York Times to give such a straightforward evaluation of the situation.

However, the main program of American agricultural policy—forcibly reducing the major harvest areas and supporting the guaranteed prices of certain agricultural commodities—is indeed intended to squeeze out small producers and support those monopolists and wealthy farmers who operate farm production.

These two programs were adopted by the U.S. government in the 1930s, when agricultural commodities reached a large degree of overproduction. But both programs have completely failed.

Under capitalism, attempts to "plan," even if they do not want to develop productive forces but only want to limit them, inevitably fail due to the anarchy of production. Due to the use of modern agricultural machinery by agricultural capitalists, and the use of subsidies they received from reducing cultivated areas to adopt more effective farming methods, the planned reduction of products cannot become a reality. For small farmers, due to their inferior technical equipment, the reduction of cultivated areas means tragic bankruptcy. But this reduction in cultivated area by small farmers actually has no effect on the total output of the market; what small farmers can give to the market is very little. Therefore, the attempt to eliminate agricultural overproduction only accelerates the process of squeezing out small farmers.

The regulation that large and small farms reduce cultivated areas by the same percentage is also another proof of the touted bourgeois equality; this equality is as Anatole France satirized: the rich and the poor are both forbidden to sleep under the bridge.

The policy of purchasing or subsidizing surplus products as a means of supporting prices has proven to be ineffective.

But in the five years of the severe economic panic from 1929 to 1933, this policy cost American taxpayers $350 million. Now, in the year 1949-50 alone, according to the latest estimates by Wall Street experts, it will cost $1.4 billion at best, and $2 billion at worst, which seems to be the most likely consequence.

These huge expenditures have not achieved the purpose of absorbing inventories, but instead have caused the accumulation of meaningless "surpluses" in the hands of the Commodity Credit Corporation.

Since the entire purpose of these measures is to support market prices for the benefit of those monopoly capitalists who plunder agriculture, naturally, these surplus commodities are not sold at low prices in the domestic market. On the other hand, foreign sales opportunities are constantly shrinking, and American farm operators "today face the 'grim fact' that foreigners will not use scarce dollars to purchase American agricultural products that are now piling up." The attempt to dispose of these "surpluses" with the "Marshall Plan" is a pipe dream, and is no longer considered an effective form, or even worth mentioning.

The New York Times wrote: "Even in the best environment, handling this inventory is difficult. It cannot be sold domestically in a way that deepens the market depression. Thus, export becomes the logical method, but the export prospects for 1950 are not optimistic. The Commodity Credit Corporation expects that borrowing and purchasing will inevitably further expand this year, and is now preparing to seek from Congress an increase of $2 billion in borrowing authority."

The result is a vicious cycle.

Because the American economy is in a state of high decay, farm products are not sold normally on the domestic market but are destroyed, and are not exported under normal commercial conditions but are dumped abroad.

The extent to which agricultural products are destroyed is not public, but judging from the sparse and fragmented news in the newspapers, it must be very huge.

Egg powder equivalent to 2.5 billion fresh eggs is stored, which, at the normal consumption rate, would take ten years to consume even if production were stopped. Due to careless storage, these goods are already decaying. The same is true for other dairy products such as milk powder, cheese, and butter.

Barron's Weekly said that only immediate consumption can avoid massive damage to these valuable foods. It said: "Approximately 210 million dozens of eggs were taken off the market, and as a result, they were destroyed by being dried." As for the butter stocks, they are clearly "not being finished at the taxpayers' tables, but in the soap-making pots."

The New York Times once accidentally reported that "some of the corn that was mortgaged for government loans or piled up under trade agreements has decayed, some of it is 80 percent rotten." This is almost a public admission that valuable grains are being destroyed. At the end of the 1948-49 year, the United States' corn storage amounted to 26.7 million tons, and it is expected to increase to 34.2 million tons in the 1949-50 year. The significance of this can be seen from the fact that the inventory is nearly double the highest record of 1942-43, and since then the market has substantially shrunk.

There is no doubt that the Commodity Credit Corporation's net loss of $600 million in the 1948-49 year was mainly due to the value of the destroyed grain, which must be borne by the taxpayers, of which nine-tenths are borne by the working masses.

Eliminating overproduction by destroying grain is a highly characteristic feature of the tumultuous period of capitalist decay, when the contradiction between the poverty of millions of working people and the enormous wealth of a handful of parasites is truly stirring. The heinous crimes committed by capitalism against the millions of people it has deprived were described by Stalin with political wisdom and profound humanitarianism:

"It must be admitted that an economic system which, when the masses are gripped by scarcity and unemployment, hunger and suffering, does not know how to deal with its 'surplus' products, and can only burn them — such a system has signed its own death warrant."

The continuous decay of capitalism is obvious. In the crisis of 1929-33, the mass destruction of grain only began when the crisis reached its peak, while in the current crisis, the destruction of grain began at the beginning of the crisis.

The scope and manner of subsidizing grain exports are also characteristic of American agriculture.

In the history of American agricultural exports, dumping has always held a prominent position. As a result of the rapacious imposition of rent by American monopoly capitalists and the exploitation of agriculture to an extent unmatched by other capitalist countries, American farm products have become increasingly unable to compete in the world market. In the past few decades, various forms of dumping have been an unchanging feature of American agricultural exports.

Throughout the period between the two world wars, the monopoly capitalists who plundered American agriculture attempted to increase agricultural exports by every conceivable means, especially grains: such as sales on credit, special loans, secret dumping (measures by the Federal Farm Board), and open dumping (export subsidies since 1933). They believed that these strategies would save them from the crisis. In the early 1930s, the United States adopted blatant and open dumping. However, even dumping could not guarantee sufficient sales of American grain in the world. This was due to the constantly rising production costs and the tariff barriers established for the benefit of American industrial monopoly capitalists, which limited the export of American agricultural products since the industrial products of grain importing countries could not be sold to the United States.

Even with all efforts, the United States could not prevent the continuous decline in grain exports between the two world wars. Only due to the sudden improvement in wartime speculation, the dispersion of the world market, and the sharp decline in the agriculture of grain importing countries, did American grain exports reach a considerable rate without subsidies. But once the good prospects stimulated by the severe damage to the agriculture of those countries affected by the Second World War ended, all the ailments of American agriculture immediately reappeared.

The United States, taking advantage of the implementation of the "aid" plan (autumn of 1947), adopted a method of secret dumping that was far more harmful to employers than ever before. Before the war, the United States stipulated that export bonuses were used to eliminate tariff barriers in importing countries (the history of American agricultural exports eloquently proves that in many cases, this was not effective). The current secret dumping method—the "subsidy" system—has resulted in strangling the industry and agriculture of the countries receiving American "aid," undermining their economic independence and national sovereignty. The fact that Western European countries have to pay a high price for this "supply," as far as American taxpayers are concerned, cannot be regarded as a form of dumping; just as they bear the expenses of the earlier "plans," they must bear the expenses of implementing the "Marshall Plan."

In addition to the new dumping methods, the United States also resumed the old and stale methods in 1949—the method of subsidizing wheat and flour exports stipulated in the International Wheat Agreement. The export bonus was as high as 56 cents per bushel, almost double the previous maximum subsidy. In addition to grains, the scope of subsidies has also been extended to the export of fresh and dried fruits, egg powder, dairy products, potatoes, cotton, etc.

Before the recent official dumping plan (January 1950) was announced, the export bonus for certain commodities was as high as 50 percent of the domestic selling price. For example, the current bonus for egg powder is nearly 70 percent of the Commodity Credit Corporation's purchase price, while potatoes are "sold" to exporters at a symbolic price of one cent per bag (100 pounds), while the normal wholesale price is $2.01.

According to existing U.S. legislation, 30 percent of tariff revenue can be used to subsidize agricultural exports. In recent years, Congress has passed some laws allowing virtually unlimited funding for dumping.

However, the United States has not achieved any results in expanding dumping on any considerable scale. This possibility is severely limited by the failure of the "Marshall Plan" and the dollar shortage of importing countries.

In this regard, it is interesting that a group of experts from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization created a plan to establish an international commodity clearinghouse, and it was discussed at the organization's last meeting in November 1949. According to this plan, dollar area countries holding surplus food stocks should exchange them for strategic raw materials or sell them for "soft" currencies.

Although it is very clear that this plan was formulated according to the orders of the United States, the American representatives in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization deliberately pretended to have nothing to do with it. However, strangely enough, an article in the Wall Street Journal on November 8, 1949, with the extremely frank title "This is not a matter of principle," detailed a dumping plan jointly drafted by the State Department and the Department of Agriculture, the main points of which were no different from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization plan. The article intriguingly commented that Uncle Sam would not know what to do with "soft" currencies. However, with a little thought, we can easily guess that American monopoly capitalists intend to invest "soft" currencies in the industries of countries that import American dumped goods, with the intention of plunging these countries into deeper enslavement.

When the Wall Street Journal complained in this article that American diplomats were embarrassed because "the entire plan directly conflicts with the trade regulations that the State Department is trying to get other countries to adopt," the newspaper broke the highest record of irony. The newspaper continued to comment glibly:

The United States "officially condemned the many barter transactions made by other countries since the end of the war in harsh terms. American diplomats have also been equally eager to oppose the 'dumping' of commodities by other countries through subsidies. When other countries engage in subsidy dumping, the United States' opposition is so strong that tariff laws require that tax rates be increased to be equal to the foreign subsidy. American representatives have tried to add to the proposed charter of the International Trade Organization this kind of clause, namely that any member country shall not give 'any item export any subsidy,' since this will make 'the selling price of the export lower than...the price of the domestic market...'. "

In any case, American politicians endured the mental blame caused by the ambiguity of their position with far greater patience than they had ever paid for the failure of the large business of exchanging America's surplus wheat for India's manganese sand. Negotiations with other countries that produce strategic raw materials have also not been successful. At the same time, there has been no news of any successful transactions in which the United States sold surplus commodities in exchange for "soft" currencies.

It is worth noting that the American dumping plan, which was recently disclosed in January and caused a storm of protest from capitalist countries that export agricultural products, has not been particularly welcomed in American business circles. Big business does not believe that exports can be increased to any appreciable extent.

Due to the development of the American crisis, it is certain that new plans for U.S. imperialist expansion of foreign markets will be proposed. However, undoubtedly, the growing mass struggles for political and economic independence within the countries that have already fallen victim to U.S. imperialist expansion will cause these aggressive plans to collapse.

　　美国的农业危机与农产品倾销
    拉波夫著  陈凤文译
    美国的农业危机以如此飞快的速度发展着，以致连美国的“大”报纸对于这种由于大量农产品没有足够的有效需求而引起的复杂性再也不能予以漠视了。在不太久以前，美国的农业远景还被描绘得灿烂夺目，而现在甚至官方的农业部公报也说，农产过剩的迅速增加及输出的剧烈下降使得情势极为严重。
    纽约先驱论坛报称：“美国农业商品市场显示出关于商品信用公司巨量存货的日益增加的反常迹象。”
    巴隆氏周报提出下列数字，表明商品信用公司（政府的一个独占事业，经营农产品的买卖、贷款及输出）所握有的“剩余品”：棉花四百万包，小麦一亿九千二百万蒲式耳，四亿零四百万磅亚麻仁油，牛油一亿多磅，乳酪五千万磅，蛋粉七千万磅等等。
    该周报对于出口前景异常悲观。农业部仍然期望输出三亿七千五百万蒲式耳小麦（因而就承认了官方的预计输出四亿五千万蒲式耳的“计划”是毫无根据的），但巴隆氏周报认为输出将很难超过三亿一千万蒲式耳。可以把这和一九四八至四九年农业年度的输出五亿零二百万蒲式耳小麦比较一下。
    纽约时报估计，随着国内农产品消费的不断低落而同时发生的是今年美国的农业输出价值将减少五亿美元的庞大数目。
    政府的维持农产品价格的政策——其结果就是商品信用公司手中积蓄了无销路的巨量过剩产品——正被大工业及银行的独占者们所控制的报纸猛烈地攻击着。
    花旗银行的“每月通讯”称：
    “商品信用公司的主要是为了维持农产品价格的净支，目前估计约达十四亿元，或较去年一月高出八亿元……。在一九四八至四九年的财政年度间，商品信用公司报告运转损失六亿元（而不是一九四八年一月所预计的一亿六百万元——拉波夫）。维持价格活动的严重扩大，不仅保持了食品价格较其应有的价格为高，同时又强加给国库以财政重负并使预算入不敷出。”
    纽约时报也同样急急忙忙地表示：
    “由于维持价格活动的结果而被美国政府累积起来的农产品的巨量过剩，有人害怕目前的农业计划正陷于失败。”
    对于美国农业情况的如此直言不讳的估计，初看起来使人颇为惊异。但解释也很简单：随着经济危机的迫近，维持农业价格使得工业独占者们日益愤恨起来了。争取政府津贴的角逐，使得各种工业中的独占者们，谈出了一些关于美国经济情况的痛苦的真象，并且一些内幕“秘密”也脱口而出了。
    “目前的农业政策，”纽约时报称，“亦被认为是逐渐消灭小农的政策。”
    惟有论战的热情，才驱使纽约时报对于这种情况给予如此直率的评价。
    但是，美国农业政策的主要方案——强迫缩小主要收获区域及支持某些农产商品的保证价格——真的是打算用来挤掉小生产者而支持那些经营农场生产的独占者们和大富农的。
    这两种方案在农业商品达到很大程度的生产过剩的三十年代中，为美国政府所采用。但这两种方案都全盘失败了。
    在资本主义之下试图“计划”，即便他们不想发展生产力而只想予以限制，但由于生产的无政府性，也就不可避免地失败。由于农业资本家使用现代化农业机械，利用他们因缩小耕种面积而得到的津贴以采用更有效的耕种方法，有计划的减少产品就不能成为事实了。对于小农，由于他们低劣的技术装备，耕种面积的缩小就意味着悲惨的破产。但这种小农耕种面积的减缩实际上对市场的总产量毫无影响，小农所能给予市场的是很少的。因而，企图消灭农业的生产过剩，只是加速了挤垮小农的进程而已。
    对于大小农场规定按照相同之百分比缩小耕种面积，同样也正是吹嘘的资产阶级平等的另一证明；这种平等正如阿纳托列·佛郎士所讽称：富人和穷人都不准在桥底下睡觉。
    购买或津贴过剩产品的政策，作为支持价格的手段，已证明了是无效的。
    但在一九二九至三三年的严重的经济恐慌的五年中，这种政策耗费了美国纳税人三亿五千万美元，现在，在一九四九至五○年一年之内，据最近华尔街专家的估计，最好的话也需要十四亿美元，而搞的不好就要二十亿美元了，这看起来是最有可能的后果。
    这些庞大的支出并没有达到吸收存货的目的，反而造成了商品信用公司手中毫无意义的“剩余品”的累积。
    既然这些措施的整个目的在为那些掠夺农业的独占资本家的利益而支持市场价格，自然，这些剩余商品，便没有以低廉的价格在国内市场上抛售了。另一方面，国外销售的机会不断地缩减，美国农场经营者们“今天面临这一‘冷酷事实’，即外国将不会用稀少的美元去购买现正堆积着的美国农产品。”希望以“马歇尔计划”来处置这些“剩余品”的企图是一种成为泡影的幻想，早就不再被认为是有效的形式，甚至是不值一提的了。
    纽约时报这样写道：“就是在最好的环境中，处理这批存货亦是困难的。它不能以加深市场不景气的方法在国内销售。这样，出口便成为合乎逻辑的方法，但是一九五○年的出口前途并不乐观。商品信用公司预计今年借款及购买必会同样地进一步扩增，现正准备向国会觅得增加二十亿美元的借款权”。
    其结果是一种恶性循环。
    由于美国经济陷于高度腐朽的状态，农场产品不是正常地在国内市场上出售而是被毁灭掉，不是在通常的商业条件下被输出而是在国外倾销。
    农产品被毁灭的程度是没有公开的，但是根据报纸上稀少零散的消息判断，它一定是很巨大的。
    相等于二十五亿个鲜蛋的鸡蛋粉贮藏着，按正常的消费率，就是停止生产也需要十年才能消耗完。由于贮藏的不小心，这些货品已经在腐败了。其他乳制品如奶粉、乳酪和牛油也是如此。
    巴隆氏周报说，只有立即消费掉才能避免这些宝贵食品的大量损坏。并称：“约二亿一千万打鸡蛋被从市场上拿走，结果是因干制而被毁掉了”。至于牛油的存货，它们显然地“不是在纳税人的餐桌上而是在制肥皂的锅里被弄光了。”
    纽约时报有一次偶然地报导称：“给政府贷款做抵押或在贸易协定下堆积起来的玉蜀黍，都有些腐败了，有些是百分之八十腐烂了的”。这几乎是公开承认宝贵的谷物在被毁坏着。在一九四八——四九年度结束的时候，美国的玉蜀黍贮量计有二千六百七十万吨，预料一九四九——五○年度将增至三千四百二十万吨。从该数字几近一倍于一九四二——四三年度的最高纪录的存货量就可以看出它的意义了，况且自那时起市场实质上已经缩小。
    毫无疑问，商品信用公司在一九四八——四九年度六亿美元的净亏主要的是毁掉了的粮食的价值，而这必需由纳税人来承担，其中十分之九是由工人群众承担的。
    以毁灭粮食的方法来消除生产过剩，是当千万劳动人民的穷困与一小撮寄生虫的巨富间的矛盾真正在动荡着的资本主义腐朽时期之高度特征。资本主义对被它剥夺的千万人民所犯的滔天大罪曾被斯大林以政治家的智慧和深厚的人道主义如此地描写过：
    “必需承认，一个经济制度，在群众被匮乏和失业、饥饿和痛苦所紧扼着的时候，不知道如何处置它的“剩余”产品，而只能烧毁它——这样一个制度签署了它自己的死亡的传票。”
    资本主义不断地腐朽是很明显的，在一九二九——三三年的危机中，只当危机达到顶点时才开始大量毁灭粮食，而在目前的危机中在危机起始时就开始毁掉粮食了。
    津贴粮食出口的范围和方式同样具有美国农业的特征。
    在美国农业品出口的历史，上倾销曾一贯保有显赫的地位。美国独占资本家们掠夺般地强加地租及对农业剥削至其他资本主义国家所不可比拟的程度的结果，美国的农场产品越来越不能在世界市场上竞争了。过去的几十年中，各种方式的倾销是美国农产品出口的不变的特色。
    两次世界大战间的整个时期中，掠夺着美国农业的独占资本家们，企图用一切可以想到的方法来增加农产品的出口，特别是五谷：如赊卖，特殊贷款，秘密倾销（联邦农场局的措施），以及公开倾销（自一九三三年开始的出口津贴）等。他们相信这些策略会把他们从危机中拯救出来。在三十年代的初期美国采取了露骨和公开的倾销。然而就是倾销也不能保证美国谷物在世界上有足够的销路。这是由于生产费用经常上涨，以及为美国工业独占资本家们的利益而建立的关税壁垒，既然谷物进口国的工业品不能卖给美国，它就限制了美国农业品的出口。
    纵使尽了一切努力，美国也不能防止在两次世界大战间谷物出口的不断下降。只有由于战时投机事业的突然好转，世界市场的分散以及谷物进口国家农业的剧降，美国的粮食出口才不用津贴而达到相当大的比率。但一旦那些在第二次世界大战中受灾的国家的农业因受到严重破坏而刺激起来的好景象结束了，美国农业的一切病症又立即重现出来。
    美国利用“援助”计划（一九四七年秋）之执行，采行了远较从前所有对顾主之危害尤大的秘密倾销方式。战前，美国规定了出口花红是用来消除入口国家之关税壁垒的（美国的农业出口史雄辩地证明了在许多情况之下，这是未能奏效的）。目前的秘密倾销方式——“补助”制度——其结果是绞杀了接受美“援”国家的工业和农业，破坏了他们的经济独立和国家主权。西欧国家对于此种“补给”必须付出高价之事实，如就美国之纳税人而论，亦不能不算为一种倾销方式；正如他们担负着早先的“计划”费用一样，他们必须负担执行“马歇尔计划”之用费。
    除掉新的倾销方式以外，美国又于一九四九年恢复了古旧陈腐的方式——国际小麦协定中所规定的津贴小麦和面粉出口的方式。出口花红高至每蒲式耳五十六分钱，差不多达到了早先的最高补助金的一倍。除谷物外，津贴的范围并扩展至鲜果、干果、鸡蛋粉、乳制品、马铃薯、棉花等等之出口。
    在最近的官方倾销计划（一九五○年一月）公布以前，某些货品之出口花红高达国内售价的百分之五十。例如目前的鸡蛋粉之花红将近商品信用公司的收购价格的百分之七十，而马铃薯则以每袋（一百磅装）一分之象征性价格“售”与出口商，当时正常的趸购价格是二元零一分。
    根据现存之美国立法，关税收入的百分之三十，可作津贴农业出口之用。近年来国会通过了允予实际上无限制地资助倾销的一些法令。
    然而，美国在任何可观的规模上扩大倾销并无成果。这种可能性是给“马歇尔计划”之失败和入口国家的美元荒所严重地限制了。
    在这一方面，有趣的是联合国粮食及农业组织的一伙专家们创作了设立国际商品票据交换所之计划，并且在一九四九年十一月该组织最后的一次会议上，还加以讨论。依此计划，保有过剩的食品存货的美元区国家，应以此换取战略原料或将其售出以换得“软”币。
    虽然，此一计划是遵照美国之命令拟定已是十分显然的事实，然而联合国粮食及农业组织中的美国代表们却故意装着与它毫无关系。然而古怪的是一九四九年十一月八日华尔街日报上的一篇有着极坦率的标题，“这不是一个原则问题”的文章，却详细地叙述了由国务院和农业部所共同拟定的倾销计划，该计划之要点是与联合国粮食及农业组织之计划并无二致的。该文耐人寻味地评称山姆大叔不会知道怎样处置“软”币。然而稍微动动脑筋，我们便不难猜出，美国独占资本家打算把“软”币在输入美国倾销货品的国家之工业上投资，其用意是要使此等国家陷入更深的奴役境遇中。
    当华尔街日报在这篇文章中抱怨因为“这计划整个地说与国务院试图使其他国家采用的贸易法规发生了直接的冲突”，而使得美国外交家狼狈万状，该日报是打破了讽刺的最高纪录的。该报继续油嘴滑舌地评论道：
    美国“官方业已严词谴责自大战结束以来他国所作的许多对外以货易货的交易。美国的外交家们也同样热切地反对其它国家通过津贴方式之商品‘倾销’。当其它国家进行津贴倾销时，美国之反对如此强烈，以致关税法要求把税率增至和外国津贴金相等。美国的代表们设法在拟议中的国际贸易组织宪章中加入了此种条款，即任何会员国不得给予‘任何物品出口以任何津贴’，盖此将使‘出口之售价低于……国内市场……之价格’”。
    无论如何，美国的政客们以远较对以美国之剩余小麦换取印度之锰砂之大宗生意之失败所曾付出之更大的忍耐，承受着由于他们地位之暧昧而招致的精神上之苛责。与其他生产战略原料之国家的谈判也没有成功。同时，也还未听到有任何关于美国出售剩余商品换取“软”币之交易成功之消息。
    值得注意的是，美国新近于一月所公开了的曾经引起了输出农产品的资本主义国家暴风雨似的抗辩的倾销计划，在美国的商业界中也并未受到任何特殊的欢迎。大企业不相信出口可以提高到任何可观之程度。
    由于美国危机之发展，可以肯定美帝国主义扩张国外市场之新计划又将提出。然而，无疑的，在业已沦为美帝扩张下之牺牲品的国家内部的日益增长的争取政治与经济独立的群众斗争，将促使此等侵略计划归于崩溃。
