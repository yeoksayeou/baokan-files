　　New Stage of the Movement to Defend World Peace
    Returning from Stockholm (Part 1) (Middle)
    Xiao San
    This conference lasted four days, from March 16th to March 19th. One hundred and fifty representatives from all over the world attended. They were representatives of various social and religious groups in various countries, as well as people from the scientific, cultural, and artistic circles.
    The main sign of this conference is that the world's movement to defend peace has entered a new and important stage.
    Continuing to firmly demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, the Third Meeting unanimously adopted an important declaration:
    "We demand the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons as weapons of mass destruction of mankind, and the establishment of strict international control to ensure the implementation of this resolution.
    We believe that any government that first uses atomic weapons against any other country is a war criminal.
    We call on all kind-hearted people around the world to sign this declaration."
    This is a powerful declaration. The words are short and simple, but this is the common language and common demand of the vast majority of people around the world.
    This conference issued a second declaration:
    "We propose to all people of goodwill: send representatives to participate in the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Italy in the fourth quarter of this year.
    We issue a call to all social and religious groups, cultural workers, and all upright people—regardless of their views on the reasons for the current international tension, as long as they are concerned about this situation and sincerely willing to rebuild peaceful relations among all ethnic groups.
    We propose to use the prohibition of atomic weapons and condemnation of the government that first uses atomic weapons as the basis for reaching an agreement." The proposal to ban atomic weapons was originally put forward by President Joliot-Curie in his opening speech at this conference and was immediately approved by everyone. Nenni, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, supported Curie's proposal. He said:
    "We agree with Curie's proposal to declare the government that first uses atomic weapons as a war criminal at this regular meeting... We are now entering a new stage of the peace movement... In many countries and in many occasions, the stage of publicity and mobilization has passed. Entering the stage of action, we are now entering the stage of struggle against the arms race."
    This resolution of the Third Standing Committee Meeting has both principled and practical significance. It gives war instigators a serious warning. Any government as a whole that dares to use atomic weapons first and every member participating in the government cannot escape the severe punishment of the people. Behind this warning stand hundreds of millions of people and kind-hearted people all over the world.
    This declaration can further expand the peace movement in countries where the peace movement has already surged or has not yet deepened, and can attract more and more forces to join this front.
    The practical work of all peace-loving people now is to collect millions of signatures on this declaration. The more signatures there are, the more isolated the war instigators will be.
    The Grand Standing Committee and the National Peace Defense Committees must do a good job of organization so that this major event representing true public opinion can proceed smoothly.
    This is not a formalistic task. It is not only about having socially active members sign, but also about having the general public sign, and about bringing forward millions of new active members of the peace movement. We must make the masses of the people consciously and actively participate in the movement to defend peace.
    Organizing signatures is something that everyone can contribute to. This is to contribute to defending peace, defending one's own life and the next generation, and it is a glorious thing.
    The Third Meeting of the Standing Committee also paid attention to the issue of organization, that is, to the issue of the effectiveness of the movement.
    We must make the movement to defend peace truly give the Anglo-American war mongers a heavy blow, and help the people of all countries oppose the arms race and atomic intimidation.
    The characteristic of the peace movement today is action!
    The strength of the peace movement in various countries around the world has expanded and strengthened, and those governments preparing for a new war cannot but have some scruples.
    Throughout history, the people of the world have always opposed wars against the people, and the majority love peace. But never in history has the peace movement become such a powerful international front as it is today.
    Now, the people of various countries, accounting for half of the world's population, are participating in the great struggle for peace. The Soviet Union is a fortress of peace. China, Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and various democratic countries have joined this camp. The people's democratic anti-imperialist movement within capitalist countries has also developed—all of this is a good condition for the success of the peace movement.
    There are three thousand peace committees in France, and several thousand factory area organizations have joined. Eight million people in France have participated in the peace vote initiated by the Peace Committee.
    There are 30,000 peace committees in Italy, and 7 million people have signed peace petitions.
    Romania has 13,545 peace committees.
    The peace movements in various countries are adopting various specific forms.
    The most active and heroic participants in the peace movement are the working classes of various countries.
    Dockworkers and railway workers in France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands are followed by workers in Norway, West Germany, Australia, Africa... Workers refuse to unload weapons shipped by the United States to arm Western European countries. Workers in factories also refuse to produce munitions. Transportation workers in France and Italy have officially announced their refusal to load and unload weapons.
    Dockworkers at the port of La Pallice, France, have declared strikes three times in the past two months, refusing to load weapons. The reactionary government attempted to arrest the strikers, causing a general strike. The people of the entire city were attracted to join the struggle to defend peace. The workers in La Pallice are very poor. When they made economic demands to the business owners, the answer they received was: "You can get everything, but with one condition, that is, you agree to load and unload any goods onto any ship." The workers rejected this condition.
    A young female worker in France saw a train carrying American tanks speeding by, and she immediately lay down on the tracks. Then two more female workers lay down. Immediately a large group of male and female workers lay down. The driver had no choice but to stop the car, and he also got off, saying, "I quit."
    The heroic actions of the French dockworkers forced the ships of the U.S. imperialists transporting weapons to France to turn back. The U.S. imperialists transported these weapons to ports where the labor movement was relatively weak or where the police suppression was more severe, such as the French African colonies, but the working people there also went on strike and held meetings to protest.
    Railway workers and locomotive drivers in Rome, Italy, passed a resolution not to transport American weapons. Residents and women's groups from various districts of Rome who attended the meeting expressed their gratitude to the railway workers. The residents are willing to cooperate with the workers. Railway workers in the Fabriano district of Ancona Province also made the same decision. In the city of Ancona, young workers in the chemical industry held a meeting to oppose the government's militarization of the chemical industry. The conference passed a resolution in which the young people swore not to work for war.
    When the U.S. imperialists transported weapons to Italy, they deliberately confused the working class. Regarding the ports of arrival of the weapons, they issued some contradictory and misleading news, wanting to disrupt the organized struggle of the workers in this way. The Italian Peace Defense Committee issued a statement stating that the U.S. imperialist method "completely conforms to wartime habits and is also a method applicable to enemy countries, which proves that the authorities regard this action as a real military action and as the first concrete military action."
    This kind of analysis contains a huge mobilizing force, making the masses aware of the fact that "unloading foreign weapons for foreign war purposes" is very dangerous.
    The scale of the masses' struggle to defend peace is expanding day by day. The reactionary regime mobilized the army to oppose the strikers. The Social Democratic Party organized scab unions to sabotage the strikes. However, organized resistance movements by the masses are occurring everywhere every day, which lays the foundation for the success of various forms of peace defense movements.

　　保卫世界和平运动的新阶段
    从斯德哥尔摩归来（之一）（中）
    萧三
    这次会议开了四天，从三月十六日起，到十九日为止。到了全世界各国的代表一百五十位。他们都是各国各种社会、宗教团体的代表和科学界文化界艺术界的人士。
    这次会议主要的标志是：世界保卫和平的运动已经进入了一项新的、重要的阶段。
    继续坚决地要求禁止原子武器，第三次会议一致通过了一项重要的宣言：
    “我们要求无条件地禁止使用原子武器作大规模毁灭人类的武器，并且建立严格的国际管制，以确保这个决议的执行。
    我们认为，任何第一个使用原子武器来对付任何其他国家的政府，就是战争罪犯。
    我们号召全世界善心的人们在这个宣言下面签名”。
    这是一个有力的宣言。字句很短、简单，但这是全世界绝大多数人们的共同的语言，共同的要求。
    这次会议又发出了第二个宣言：
    “我们向一切善意的人们提议：派遣代表来参加今年第四季在意大利召开的第二次世界拥护和平大会。
    我们向一切社会与宗教团体，文化工作者和所有正直的人们——不论他们对当前国际形势所以紧张的原因持何见解，只要是对这种形势感到忧虑并且诚恳地愿意在各族人民间重建和平关系的人们——发出号召。
    我们提议，以禁止原子武器及谴责第一个使用原子武器的政府（这一项），作为达成协议的基础”。禁止原子武器这个提议本是和大主席居里教授在这次会议的开幕词里提出来的，立即得到大家的赞同。意大利社会党的领袖南尼拥护居里的提议，他说：
    “我们赞同居里的提议在这次常会上宣布首先使用原子武器的政府为战犯……我们现在进入和平运动的新阶段……在许多国家，许多场合里，宣传鼓动的阶段已经过去了。进入行动的阶段，我们现在进入反对军备竞赛的斗争的阶段了。”
    第三次常委会议的这个决议具有原则的和实际的意义。它给予战争挑拨者以严重的警告。凡是胆敢首先使用原子武器的政府整体和参加政府的各个成员都不能逃脱人民严厉的惩罚。这个警告的后面，站着成千百万的人，全世界的善心人。
    这个宣言能够使得那些和平运动已经高涨或尚未深入的国家的和平运动，进一步地扩大起来，能够吸引越来越多的力量参加到这个阵线里来。
    现在所有爱好和平的人的实际工作就是要收集成千百万的人在这个宣言上签名。签名的越多，战争挑拨者就越孤立。
    和大常委和各国保卫和平委员会要好好地作组织工作，使得这个表示真正民意的大事能够顺利地进行。
    这不是一个形式主义的工作，不仅只要社会上积极的活动的分子签名，而且要广大的老百姓都来签名，要提出成百万的和平运动的新的活动积极分子。要人民群众都自觉地积极地来参加保卫和平的运动。
    组织签名是每个人都能出力的，这就是为保卫和平、保卫自己这一辈子和后一代而出一份力量，这是光荣的事。
    常委第三次会议也注意到了组织的问题，就是注意了运动的效果问题。
    我们要使得保卫和平的运动真正能够给英美战争贩子一个沉重的打击，要帮助各国人民反对军备竞争和原子恐吓的斗争。
    和平运动在今天的特点就是行动！
    世界各国的和平运动的力量扩大了，加强了，那些准备新战争的政府也就不能不有所顾忌了。
    从来世界上的人民总是反对反人民的战争，爱好和平的居多数。但是历史上从来没有过像今天这样的和平运动成为了国际有力的战线。
    现在已有占全人类一半的各国人民参加争取和平的伟大斗争，苏联是和平的堡垒。中国、中欧、东南欧、各民主国家加入这个阵营。资本主义国家内的人民民主反帝运动也发展起来了——这一切是和平运动成功的良好的条件。
    法国有三千个和平委员会，有好几千个工厂区域的组织加入了。全法国有八百万人参加过和委会发动的和平投票。
    意大利有三万个和平委员会，有七百万人在和平请愿书上签了名。
    罗马尼亚有了一万三千五百四十五个和平委员会。
    各国的和平运动，采用着各种不同的具体的形式。
    参加和平运动最积极最英勇的是各国的工人阶级。
    法国的、意大利的、比利时的、荷兰的码头工人，铁路工人，接着就有娜威的、西德的、澳洲的、非洲的……工人都拒绝卸运美国运来武装西欧各国的武器。工厂的工人也拒绝生产军火。法、意的运输工人已正式宣布拒绝装卸武器。
    法国拉·巴利萨港口的码头工人在最近两月之内，三次宣布罢工，拒绝装运武器。反动政府企图逮捕罢工者，引起总罢工。全城的人民都被吸引加入保卫和平的斗争。拉·巴利萨的工人生活穷困的很。当他们向企业主提出经济要求时，得到的回答是：“你们可以得到一切，但是有一个条件，即你们同意装、卸任何货物到任何轮船上”。工人们拒绝了这个条件。
    法国一个青年女工，看见一列火车载着美国坦克飞快地开来了，她立即躺到铁轨上。接着又有两个女工躺下。立即一大群男女工人都躺下来。开车的司机只好停住车，自己也下来，说，不干了。
    法国码头工人的英勇行动，逼迫得美帝国主义者运送武器到法国的船折回去。美帝国主义者把这些武器运到工人运动比较弱，或者警察镇压的比较更凶的港口，例如法属非洲殖民地去，可是那里的劳动人民也罢工，也集会抗议。
    意大利罗马的铁路工人，火车头司机工人通过决议，不运输美国武器。到会的罗马各区居民及妇女团体对铁路工人表示感谢，居民愿意与工人互助合作。安孔省法布利昂区的铁路工人也作了同样的决定。在安孔城，化学工业的青年工人开会反对政府把化学工业军事化。大会通过决议，青年们宣誓不为战争工作。
    美帝国主义者运送武器到意大利去的时候，故意混淆工人阶级的视听，关于武器到达的港口，发出一些矛盾的、迷向的消息，想这样来扰乱工人们有组织的斗争。意大利保卫和平委员会发出声明，认为美帝国主义这种办法，“完全符合于战时的习惯，也是适用于敌国的方法，这就证明着，政权方面把这个行动看作真正的军事行动，看作第一个具体的军事动作”。
    这样的一种分析，就包含着巨大的动员的力量，使群众注意到“为了外国的战争目的而卸运外国的武器”这件事实的本身是很危险的。
    群众为保卫和平的斗争，规模一天天扩大。反动的政权动员军队来反对罢工者。社会民主党组织工贼的工会来破坏罢工。但群众的有组织的反抗运动，每天都在各处发生，这就建立起各种形式的保卫和平的运动获得成功的基础。
