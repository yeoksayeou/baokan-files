(Shijiazhuang News) Our reporter Lu Sheng reports: Farmers in various counties of the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province are tensely sowing cotton. According to the cotton planting situation in Yuanshi, Gaocheng, Zhao, and Gaoyi counties of the special district, by the 21st of this month, 373,000 mu of cotton fields had been planted, reaching 55% of the original plan of 675,300 mu for these four counties. Yuanshi County originally planned to plant 170,000 mu, and 100,000 mu had been sown by the 21st. Some districts and villages have exceeded the original planned acreage. For example, District One of Zhao County originally planned to plant 17,000 mu, but by the 21st, 18,000 mu had been planted. The main reason for the rapid sowing is the implementation of the special commissioner's office and the district party committee's urgent instructions on cotton planting. For example, after receiving the urgent instructions, Luancheng and Huolu counties immediately convened meetings of cadres in the rain to prepare for a concentrated cotton planting effort after the rain stopped. Thus, as soon as the rain stopped, county and district cadres went to the villages, which played a significant role in promoting mass cotton planting. Secondly, various counties have also made many innovations in leadership methods and in dispelling farmers' concerns. For example, after cadres from Gaocheng County arrived at Shilipu Village, they found that the farmers were unwilling to plant "large flower" cotton. They immediately addressed the farmers' concerns and used a comparison method between "small flower" and "large flower" cotton to illustrate that planting "large flower" cotton was more profitable. After the farmers understood that planting "large flower" cotton was more beneficial, they automatically changed their plans to plant "small flower" cotton. Zhaocheng, Huolu, and Jin counties used comparisons between the living conditions of households that profited from cotton planting last year and those that did not, making typical reports at meetings to inspire the masses to plant more cotton. For example, farmer Li Tanjv of Pengjiazhuang had 12 mu of land and planted 10 mu of cotton last year. Now, not only is his life good, but he has also built three new houses and bought an ox. Li Laozhong has 10 mu of land and did not plant a single mu of cotton last year. Not only did he not repair his house or buy an ox, but his life is also not good now. The village originally planned to plant 4,800 mu of cotton, and the cadres lacked confidence in completing it. After this typical report, the farmers immediately reported that the acreage to be planted in cotton reached 3,330 mu. However, some problems still exist in the leadership of various counties and districts that need to be resolved urgently: (1) Some county leaders still lack confidence in completing the cotton planting task. Jin County only emphasizes that farmers have many concerns about planting more cotton, but rarely studies how to dispel these concerns and how to specifically organize farmers to plant more cotton. The urgent instructions of the special commissioner's office and the district party committee have not been fully implemented in the districts and villages. Some district cadres are still constantly going home during this urgent cotton planting period. For example, in District Three, there are a total of 28 district cadres, of whom 2 are sick and 7 have returned home, leaving only 12 cadres going to the villages to carry out the concentrated cotton planting effort. (2) Some county leaders lacked confidence in completing the cotton planting task before the rain. But once it rained, they proposed to exceed the target. As a result, county, district, and village levels successively increased the number of mu to be planted in cotton, forming blind optimism. For example, Shulu County originally had no confidence in completing the plan, but after the rain, it proposed to increase it from 285,000 mu to 360,000 mu. The acreage allocated to District Five by the county increased from 36,000 mu to 40,000 mu, and the number allocated from the district to the village increased to 56,000 mu. As a result, the allocation to the village was not in line with the actual situation. Lujiazhuang Village in District One has a total of 1,800 mu of land. Last year, 600 mu of wheat were planted. Before the rain, the village was allocated to plant 1,200 mu of cotton. After the rain, the district leaders, without conducting a specific investigation, blindly increased the cotton acreage for the village by 300 mu. With only 1,200 mu of white land, how could 1,500 mu of cotton be planted? Because of the emphasis on exceeding the completion of the task, some districts and villages have formed a serious commandist style. For example, when Lao Ping, a village cadre in Neizhu Village, Gaocheng County, mobilized the masses to plant cotton, he said: "This year, we must plant more cotton. No one is allowed to plant grain. If anyone is found planting grain, we will mobilize the students to dig it up for you." Therefore, after the village chief of Guxian Village accepted the cotton planting task in the district and returned to the village, he also allocated the numbers to each household according to the figures. After the allocation, he was afraid that the farmers would not complete it, so he had the farmers put their fingerprints on the document, saying that whoever did not complete the number would be punished. When a cadre from the Zhaocheng Court went to Xihe Village to mobilize cotton planting, he first gathered the farmers together, had the village cadres stand guard, and had the masses make plans on the spot, saying that whoever did not make a good plan could not leave. The above deviations have aroused the attention of the Shijiazhuang Special Commissioner's Office and the District Party Committee. The Special Commissioner's Office and the District Party Committee jointly issued instructions on the 23rd, clearly stipulating that the five days before the Beginning of Summer should still be focused on the concentrated cotton planting effort. It called on the leaders of various counties to strengthen their confidence, accurately calculate, and specifically help farmers solve the difficulties in cotton planting. They should use the methods of "typical reports" and "comparative methods" to educate the masses to plant more cotton; oppose the commandist style of blindly stipulating numbers without regard to the actual situation and emphasizing exceeding the target. They should also immediately organize an in-depth inspection of the implementation of the instructions of the Special Commissioner's Office and the District Party Committee. For districts and villages that have already been sown, they should check how they were completed. If they find that the plans are not realistic, they should be revised in a timely manner.

　　河北石家庄专区
    农民紧张播种棉花
    有的区村强调超过任务发生强迫命令应即纠正
    【石家庄讯】本报记者鲁生报道：河北省石家庄专区各县农民，正在紧张的播种棉花。根据该专区元氏、藁城、赵县、高邑四县种棉情况，到本月二十一日已种棉田三十七万三千亩，达到该四县原计划种六十七万五千三百亩的百分之五十五。元氏县原计划种十七万亩，到二十一日已下种十万亩。有些区村已超过原计划亩数。如赵县一区原计划种一万七千亩，到二十一日即种一万八千亩。播种快的主要原因是贯彻了专署和地委会对种棉工作的紧急指示。如栾城获鹿等县接到紧急指示后，即冒雨召集干部开会，准备雨停后即下乡突击种棉。这样雨刚停县区干部就到了村，对推动群众多种棉上起作用很大。其次各县对领导方法和解除农民的顾虑也有许多创造。如藁城县干部到该县十里铺村后，发现农民都不愿种大花，他们即针对农民的顾虑进行解释，并用小花和大花的对比方法，说明种大花得利大，农民群众了解了种大花利大，就自动地改变了种小花的计划。赵城、获鹿、晋县则采用去年种棉得利户与没种棉户的生活情况比较，在会上作典型报告，启发群众多种棉。如彭家庄农民李探巨有十二亩地，去年种了十亩棉，到现在不但生活过得好，还盖了三间新房买下一头牛。李老忠有十亩地，去年没种一亩棉，不但没修房买牛，连现在生活都过得不好。该村原计划种四千八百亩棉，干部很没信心完成。经过这次典型报告后，农民当场报到种棉亩数即达三千三百三十亩。但在各县区领导还存在了一些问题紧待解决：（一）有些县领导上对完成种棉任务还缺乏信心。晋县只强调农民对多种棉顾虑多，对如何解除这些顾虑，如何具体组织农民多种棉的办法却很少研究，专署地委会的紧急指示也未完全贯彻到区村。有些区区干在这种棉紧急时候，还不断回家。如三区共有二十八个区干部，其中即有两个病的七个回家的，下乡突击种棉的干部只有十二人。（二）有些县领导上在下雨前对完成种棉任务信心不大。但一到下雨后即提出要超过任务；结果县区村逐级向下增加种棉数目字，形成盲目乐观。如束鹿县原没信心完成计划，但到下雨后，即提出由二十八万五千亩增加到三十六万亩。五区按县分配亩数即由三万六千亩增加到四万亩，区往村分配数字又增加到五万六千亩，结果分配到村就不适合实际情况。一区芦家庄共有一千八百亩地，去年已种六百亩麦，今年雨前分配他村种一千二百亩棉；下雨后该区领导上不作具体调查，又盲目的给该村增加三百亩棉。白地只有一千二百亩，怎能播种一千五百亩棉呢？因为强调超过完成任务，因此又使一些区村形成严重的强迫命令。如藁城县内主村村干部老平动员群众种棉时说：“今年要多种棉花，谁也不准种谷子，如果发现谁种谷子，就发动学生给你刨。”故献村村长在区接受种棉任务回村后，也按数字分配给各户，分后又怕农民不完成，又挨门挨户让农民按手印，他说谁完不成数字谁受罚。赵城法院一个干部到西河村发动种棉时，先把农民召集在一齐，让村干部站上岗，让群众当场订计划，并说谁订不好谁不能走。以上偏向已引起石家庄专署与地委重视，该专署与地委会于二十三日联合发出指示，明确规定立夏前五天仍是以突击种棉为中心。号召各县领导上要坚定信心，精确计算，具体帮助农民解决种棉中的困难。用“典型报告”和“对比方式”的办法教育群众多种棉；反对不按实际情况盲目规定数字，强调超过任务的强迫命令作风。并立即组织深入检查专署和地委会指示贯彻情形。对已下种的区村，要检查是如何完成的？发现计划不切实际的要及时修正。
