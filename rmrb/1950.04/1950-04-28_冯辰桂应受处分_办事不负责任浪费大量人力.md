　　Feng Chengui Should Be Punished
　　——Irresponsible Work Wastes Significant Manpower
　　To support farmers' production, the Huolu County Branch of the People's Bank of China signed a contract with the Mengtong Village Oil Mill in the fifth district for "183,546 jin of oil cakes in exchange for cottonseeds," intending to lend these oil cakes to the masses as fertilizer. On February 20th, the branch sent accountant Feng Chengui to Mengtong to inspect the oil cake production. Upon arriving at the village, Feng did not conduct an actual inspection. Instead, he listened to the oil mill's claim that "90,000 jin have been produced!" and reported back to the county that "90,000 jin have been produced!" On March 6th, the branch again sent Feng to the Mengtong Oil Mill for another inspection. He still didn't conduct an actual inspection, continuing to believe there were 90,000 jin. Based on Feng Chengui's report of 90,000 jin, county branch cadres mobilized twenty large carts and more than ten small carts from Huangbi and Yancun in the fourth district to Mengtong to collect the bean cakes. As the oil mill hadn't yet produced them, they returned empty after a forty-li round trip. On March 13th, branch cadre Liu Wenjie personally went to Dahe Village to inquire about this matter with Feng Chengui. On March 22nd, Feng Chengui wrote again to Wang Ji and other cadres working for the branch in the fourth district: "The Mengtong Oil Mill is ready to produce oil cakes, why haven't you come to collect them?" Based on this letter, Wang Ji and others again organized forty large carts and more than ten small carts from Yancun to Mengtong to collect oil cakes. Upon arrival, there were only 6,900 jin, enough for only ten large carts. The other large and small carts returned empty. Although leaders and other cadres also bear responsibility for this serious waste of manpower, the main responsibility should be borne by Feng Chengui. The county branch has submitted a request to the Huolu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for strict punishment. The Mengtong Oil Mill, which deceived the public, has been ordered to produce the oil cakes and personally deliver them to the farmers in Huangbi and Yancun who were to be loaned the oil cakes, and the interest for the delayed time will be converted into oil cakes and compensated to the borrowers.

　　冯辰桂应受处分
    ——办事不负责任浪费大量人力
    人民银行获鹿县支行为了扶植农民生产，与五区孟同村油坊订了“以棉籽换油饼一八三五四六斤”的合同，准备将这项油饼贷给群众作肥料，二月二十日，支行派会计冯辰桂到孟同去检查油饼生产情形，冯到该村后，不实际去检查，只听油坊说：“已作出九万斤！”他便回县报告：“已作出九万斤！”三月六日，支行又派冯去孟同油坊再检查，他仍未实际检查，还以为有九万斤，县支行干部根据冯辰桂有九万斤的报告，发动四区黄璧、沿村二十辆大车，十多辆小车，到孟同去取豆饼，油坊还没作出，往返四十里，放空而回。三月十三日，支行干部刘文杰亲到大河村去找冯辰桂查询此事。三月二十二日，冯辰桂又给支行在四区工作的干部王继等去信：“孟同油坊已准备出油饼，怎么你们也不去拉？”王继等根据此信，又组织沿村大车四十辆，小车十多辆，到孟同去取油饼，去之后，只有六千九百斤，仅够十辆大车拉，其他大车、小车都放了空。发生这个严重浪费民力问题，领导上及其他干部虽也有责任，但主要责任应由冯辰桂负。县支行已呈请中共获鹿县委会，给以严格处分，对欺骗公家的孟同油坊，已令其将油饼做出，亲自给黄璧、沿村贷油饼的农民送去，并将耽误时间的利息，折成油饼，补给贷户。
