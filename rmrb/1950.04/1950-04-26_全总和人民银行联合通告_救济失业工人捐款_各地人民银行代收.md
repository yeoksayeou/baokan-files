    Donations to Aid Unemployed Workers to be Collected by Local Branches of the People's Bank
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] Following the call from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai and across the country, workers from factories, enterprises, government offices, and schools across the nation, as well as commanders and fighters from all units of the People's Liberation Army, have been eagerly donating. To standardize the collection of these donations and avoid confusion, it has been decided that the People's Bank of China will be the unified collection agency. We request that trade union organizations at all levels, as well as all enterprises, government offices, schools, organizations, and military units, submit all donations for the relief of unemployed workers to the local branch of the People's Bank of China for collection. Please also inform the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of the amount of the donation at the same time. Organizations that have already collected donations should transfer the full amount to the local branch of the People's Bank of China. This is hereby notified.
