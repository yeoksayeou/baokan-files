Xinhua News Agency, April 14th dispatch: TASS, Paris, April 12th -- *L'Humanité*, in discussing the Vietnam War, wrote: The situation of the French "expeditionary force" in Indochina has become even more dire. When compelled to admit their failure, the "expeditionary force" headquarters can only issue communiqués that say nothing. However, information obtained from Indochina has fully confirmed the recent victories won by the Vietnam People's Liberation Army. The Vietnam People's Liberation Army's victorious battle in Tra Vinh province in South Vietnam is the beginning of a general counter-offensive, which has been prepared for months by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army, and all the Vietnamese people.

The victory of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army in South Vietnam has immediately affected the situation in Saigon. In order to ease the tense situation in Saigon, the Bảo Đại puppet regime had no choice but to announce on April 10th the reopening of schools in the city, which had been closed since the large-scale demonstrations on March 19th to protest American aid to the Bảo Đại regime. Intellectuals arrested during the demonstrations have been released.

　　全越人民经数月准备  胜利总反攻业已开始
    人道报评论越南战局
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：《人道报》在论及越南战争时写道：法国在印度支那“远征军”的处境，已变得更加恶劣。到了迫不得已要承认自己的失败时，“远征军”总部只好发表一些什么也没有讲的公报。但是，从印度支那所得的情报，已经充分证实了最近越南人民解放军所获得的胜利。越南人民解放军在南越臻滀省进行了胜利的战斗，这是总反攻的开始，这个总反攻已由越南民主共和国政府、越南人民解放军以及全越南人民经过了数月的准备。
    越南人民解放军在南越的胜利，立即影响到西贡的局势。保大傀儡政权为了要缓和西贡的紧张局势，不得不在四月十日宣布市内学校开学，这些学校是在三月十九日为了抗议美国对保大政权的援助而举行大规模示威游行以后被封闭的。在这次示威游行中被捕的知识分子，已经获得释放。
