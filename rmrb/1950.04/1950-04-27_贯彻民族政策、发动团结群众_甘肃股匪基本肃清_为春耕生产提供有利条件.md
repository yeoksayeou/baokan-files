　　Implementing National Policies, Mobilizing and Uniting the Masses
　　Gansu Gang Banditry Basically Eliminated
　　Providing Favorable Conditions for Spring Planting
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Xi'an Masses Daily published on the 19th: Gang banditry in Gansu Province has been basically eliminated. This is a great joyous event for the Northwest region. The state of unrest in the rural areas of Gansu Province since liberation has now basically ended. All highway transportation can be safely accessed, creating very favorable prerequisites for spring planting and carrying out other work.

　　In the past six months, a total of more than 16,000 bandits have been eliminated in Gansu Province. Among the notorious bandit leaders who were killed, wounded, captured, or surrendered, there were 34 at the level of brigade commander or above. The number of weapons captured included 35 various cannons, 479 light and heavy machine guns, more than 10,000 rifles, and more than 460,000 rounds of ammunition.

　Political Power Combined with Military Suppression
　　In the process of suppressing bandits, our bandit suppression troops implemented national policies, mobilized and united the masses of all ethnic groups, and used strong political power to cooperate with and guarantee the victory of military suppression. Our bandit suppression troops sent strong armed work teams deep into the countryside to widely explain our Party's policies, publicize the victory of our army, expose bandit and special agent rumors, establish political power, strengthen the confidence of the masses, and provide relief and resettlement for the masses robbed by bandits. The property robbed by bandits was confiscated and posted for the masses to claim. In areas with mixed ethnic groups, the troops first conducted in-depth education on national policies, corrected the remaining great Han chauvinism in the minds of Han cadres and soldiers, explained the importance of respecting the customs and habits of minority ethnic groups, and eliminated words that stimulated ethnic resentment in speech and writing. Progressive people from various ethnic groups were absorbed into the democratic government. In purely ethnic areas, they were helped to implement regional autonomy. Minority ethnic cadres were trained and absorbed to participate in the work. The Hui and Han people were mobilized and helped to formulate unity and mutual assistance pacts to resolve ethnic prejudices and suspicions, respect each other, help each other, and guarantee that there would be no discrimination or retaliation. It was explained in detail that bandits are the common enemy of all ethnic groups. In this way, the people of all ethnic groups emotionally leaned towards our Party and our army and took the initiative to cooperate with our army in suppressing bandits. For example, the broad masses of Hui people automatically sent letters and intelligence to our army and led the way. In the bandit suppression battle in Ningding County, the Hui people in the city risked breaking through the bandit's defenses and sent letters to us three times. The Tibetan people in Linxia, the Salar people, and the Tibetan people in the Qilian Mountains organized and cooperated with our army to attack the bandits. The Mongolians of Ejin Banner automatically eliminated scattered bandits who attempted to flee.

　　At the same time, the army clarified our army’s policy toward bandits through meetings of representatives from all walks of life, mass rallies, symposiums for family members of bandits, distribution of leaflets, and posting of slogans. We also investigated the background and social experiences of bandit leaders and their motives and purposes for becoming bandits, and sought clues from them to carry out appeasement. People related to the bandits and the surrendered bandits who sincerely regretted were used to persuade the bandits to surrender. The captives of the bandits were treated leniently, and torture, indiscriminate killing, and corporal punishment were strictly prohibited. After being organized for short-term education, after the individual confessed their mistakes and made a guarantee, they were released after a mass meeting. Travel expenses were also given as appropriate, and they were encouraged to return to their hometowns to produce.

　Lenient Treatment of Captives, Resolute Suppression of Stubborn Bandits
　　For stubborn bandits, resolute suppression was carried out. Our bandit suppression troops investigated and studied the bandit situation, military topography, and bandit tactics at any time and any place, grasped the bandit's activity patterns, used time to conduct combat reviews, and mastered bandit suppression tactics. Before each battle, most preparations were made thoroughly, and deployments were made carefully. Often using three, five, or seven times the absolute superiority of troops, moving unexpectedly, dispatching multiple routes, conducting long-distance raids, dividing and converging attacks, surrounding on all sides, and attacking fiercely. When bandits fled, they were pursued continuously in coordination with infantry and cavalry, regardless of fatigue, overcoming various difficulties given by nature, so that the bandits had "no place to hide, live, or go, no food to eat, and no chance to breathe" (words spoken by bandit leader Ma Lasi after surrendering), and had no choice but to surrender. For example, a certain unit tasked with bandit suppression in the Linxia sub-district did not take New Year's vacations, day or night, regardless of hunger or cold, and launched more than ten days of suppression. Sometimes, they crossed four or five large mountains in a day while chasing the enemy. These mountains had never been walked on before, and the snow was a foot deep, and the treetops were more than one person tall. Without food, they only ate potatoes. Without water to drink, they ate snow. A small number of comrades ran off their shoes and socks due to the fierce pursuit and suppression and chased bandits barefoot. Resolutely complete the bandit suppression task.

　　For this severe bandit suppression task, the Party, government, army, and people of Gansu Province cooperated closely and unified leadership. Provincial and county joint defense and urban-rural coordination were also implemented. For example, the Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan sub-districts organized bandit suppression headquarters with responsible comrades from the Party, government, and army. Zhangye and Wuwei sub-districts also implemented this organizational structure in the countryside. During the bandit suppression period, the work teams followed the bandit suppression troops. The troops suppressed bandits in the front, and the work teams organized the masses, carrying grain and grass to keep up, while doing post-war work. Party, government, and military cadres in Weiyuan County went to the countryside together and, in conjunction with the masses, cracked five bandit cases. The guard regiment and the Lintan government cooperated with the people and won six battles and six victories.

　　When bandits roamed the edge mountainous areas bordering provinces and counties, after each unit and each region formulated combat plans, if the cooperation of other regions was required, they would consult with neighboring provinces and counties in advance and take action at the same time. For example, the Mei Shucheng gang of more than 150 bandits entrenched in the Tianshui sub-district was mostly annihilated under the joint attack of our Baoji and Tianshui troops. The Dingxi sub-district's local armed forces cooperated with the Ningxia troops to annihilate Ma Shaowu's bandits. The urban and rural governments, bandit suppression command organs, and urban and rural people in the Wuwei sub-district exchanged information and organized patrol teams, leaving the bandits with nowhere to go and wiping them out.

　　In the future, Gansu Province's bandit suppression work should strive to thoroughly eliminate scattered bandits on the existing foundation and prevent any slackness, paralysis, relaxation, or complacency due to the victory already achieved. In particular, it is necessary to prevent bandits from spreading during the spring famine.

　　贯彻民族政策、发动团结群众
    甘肃股匪基本肃清
    为春耕生产提供有利条件
    【本报讯】西安群众日报十九日刊载：甘肃全省成股土匪已经基本肃清，这是西北地区一件大喜事。解放以来甘省农村里动乱不安的状态，现在已基本结束，全部公路交通可以安全通达，给春耕生产和开展其他工作造成了很有利的先决条件。
    半年来，甘省一共消灭股匪一万六千余人，毙伤俘和投降的著名匪首，有旅长以下营长以上的一共三十四名。缴获各种炮三十五门，轻重机关枪四百七十九挺，长短枪一万余支，各种子弹四十六万多发。
  政治力量配合军事清剿
    在剿匪过程中，我剿匪部队贯彻了民族政策，发动和团结各族各界群众，用强大的政治力量，来配合和保证了军事清剿的胜利。我剿匪部队派出坚强的武装工作组，深入农村，广泛的讲解我党政策，宣传我军胜利，揭破匪特谣言，建立政权，坚定群众信心，救济和安置被土匪抢劫的群众，把土匪抢劫的财物收缴回来，出布告让群众来认领。在民族杂居地区首先在部队里进行了深刻的民族政策教育，纠正了汉人干部及战士中大民族主义的残余思想，讲解尊重少数民族的风俗习惯的重要，根绝了口头上、文字上刺激民族反感的字眼。吸收各民族中的进步人士参加民主政权，在纯民族区乡，就帮助他们实行区域自治。培养少数民族干部，吸收参加工作。发动和帮助回汉人民订立团结互助公约，排解民族成见猜忌，互相尊重，互相帮助，互相保证不发生歧视和报复行为，详细说明了土匪是各民族的共同敌人。这样就使各族人民从感情上靠拢我党我军，主动的协同我军剿匪。如：广大的回民自动给我军送信，送情报，带路，在宁定县的剿匪战斗中，城内回民，冒险突破土匪警戒，三次向我送信。临夏的藏民，萨拉族人民，祁连山的藏民，组织起来，配合我军夹击土匪。额济纳旗的蒙民，自动消灭企图潜逃的散匪。
    同时，通过各界代表会议、群众大会、土匪家属座谈会，散发传单、张贴标语，阐明我军对匪政策。还调查匪首的出身、社会经历，当土匪的动机和目的，从中寻找线索进行招抚。通过与匪有关系的人员和诚恳悔过的投降过来的土匪，向土匪进行劝降。对于土匪的俘虏从宽处理，严禁拷打乱杀和肉刑拷问，把他们组织起来，进行短期教育后，由本人认错具结，经群众大会释放，还酌情发给路费，勉励还乡生产。
  从宽处理俘虏坚决剿灭顽匪
    对于顽抗的土匪，进行坚决的剿灭，我剿匪部队，随时随地调查研究匪情、兵要地形和匪军战术，掌握匪军活动规律，利用时间，进行战斗检讨，熟练剿匪战术。在每一次战斗以前大多作了充分准备，周密部署，常常用三倍、五倍、七倍的绝对优势兵力，出敌不意，数路出动，远道奔袭，分进合击，四方包围，猛打猛冲，遇匪溃逃时，即以步骑配合，不怕疲劳，克服了自然界所给的各种困难，连续穷追，使匪“无处可藏、可住、可走，无粮可吃，无喘息机会”（匪首马拉寺投降以后说的话），只有投降。如担任临夏分区剿匪任务的某部在新年前后，不过年假，不分昼夜，不怕饥饿，不怕冷冻，展开十余天的清剿。有时日内追敌连翻四、五架大山，这些山都是从来没有人走过的，积雪尺深，林梢长有一人多高。没有粮食，光吃洋芋。没有水喝，就吃积雪。少数同志因追击猛烈将鞋袜跑掉而赤脚追剿。坚决完成清剿任务。
    对于这一严重的剿匪任务，甘省党政军民密切合作，统一领导，还实行了省县联防和城乡配合。如：武威、张掖、酒泉三分区，以党政军负责同志，组织剿匪指挥部。张掖、武威两分区，还把这种组织机构贯彻到乡村。剿匪期间，工作组随剿匪部队行动，部队在前边剿匪，工作组组织群众，驮着粮草跟上，同时作善后工作。渭源县党政军干部一起下乡，结合群众，破获匪案五件。警卫一团和临潭政府与人民配合行动，六战六捷。
    在土匪流窜于省与省、县与县交界的边缘山地时，各部、各地拟定作战计划后，如果需要其他地区配合时，就事先和毗邻省县商量，同时动作。如：盘据在天水分区的梅树成股匪一百五十余人，在我宝鸡及天水部队联合夹击下大部被歼。定西分区地方武装配合宁夏部队歼灭马绍武股匪，武威分区城乡政府、剿匪指挥机关及城乡人民，互通情报、组织巡逻队，使匪走头无路而就歼。
    今后甘肃省的剿匪工作当在现有的基础上，力求彻底肃清散匪，防止因既得胜利而产生丝毫轻敌、麻痹、松懈、自满，尤其要防止土匪乘春荒时期蔓延。
