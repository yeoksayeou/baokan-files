　　The U.S. Budget
　　The American government, which once permitted its satellite nations and colonial countries joining its camp to achieve prosperity and happiness, has now shown that it cannot achieve its goals.
　　American newspapers say that one of the major problems facing the White House now is how to prepare recommendations for the next fiscal year's budget estimate in the President's State of the Union address to Congress in January. Although the burden of direct and indirect taxes on the American people is so heavy, the nation's revenue is still insufficient to cover the huge expenditures on the military and war preparations, on the Cold War, and on aggressive foreign policies. The United States already has a large deficit in its fiscal budget, and it is estimated that by the end of this fiscal year, June 30, 1950, this figure will reach approximately five billion.
　　Financial experts are racking their brains trying to figure out how to balance the budget. This is not a pleasant task, because it is already known that it will not be successful. Some have proposed increasing income tax rates, but the monopoly merchants are unwilling. They will never bear the cost of that adventurous policy themselves; they only intend to profit from arms contracts and plunder wealth from Marshallized countries. However, the work of these experts will inevitably be calculating the increase in the deficit budget for the next fiscal year.
　　However, these problems can be easily solved: the most important thing is to cut the astronomical figure spent on frantic war preparations—which accounts for about 30 billion of the total budget of 43 billion. Savings can be made on the following expenditures: supporting and building military bases that surround the world, militarizing the country, producing atomic bombs, supporting a large number of agents and spies, and planning and instigating rebellions in people's democratic countries; in addition, several expenditures caused by aggressive foreign policies can be saved. In this way, not only can the fiscal budget be balanced, but there will also be billions of dollars available for urgent national undertakings—such as building schools or public health facilities, or even building several dikes, because due to the lack of dikes, New York recently lacked enough water to flush toilets, wash clothes, or even provide drinking water.
　　But such a simple solution has never entered the minds of the experts and the president. In the coming fiscal year, billions of people's money will be poured into the bottomless barrel of adventurous foreign policy and the arms race. (Zhen Xiong translated from "New Era," 1950, Issue 1)

　　美国的预算
    美国政府，曾允许给它的卫星国家与加入它阵营的殖民地国家带来繁荣与幸福，到如今已显示出它无法达到目的了。
    美国报纸上说，白宫现在所遭遇的大问题之一，是在正月里总统向国会发表的咨文上，如何编制对于下一财政年度的概算表的建议书。虽然美国人民的直接税与间接税的负担是如此重大，但国家的岁入仍不足应付那些用于军队和战争准备、用于冷战和侵略的外交政策方面的大量支出。美国在财政预算方面已有一笔很大的亏空，并且估计到本财政年的末期，一九五○年六月三十日，这笔数字将达五十亿左右。
    财政专家们正在绞尽心血要设法平衡预算。这不是一件愉快的工作，因为现在已预知是不会成功的。有人提议增加所得税的税率，但是独占商人们不愿意。他们决不肯自己负担那冒险政策的代价，他们只打算从军火合同中获取利润以及从马歇尔化国家内劫掠财富。可是，这些专家们的工作，必将是计算着下一财政年度中的赤字预算的增加。
    然而，这些问题是可以很容易地解决的：最主要的是削减这笔疯狂的用于备战的天文数字——它在总预算四百三十亿中要占三百亿左右。对于下列各笔支出，很可以节省一下：用于支持和建设那些包围全世界的军事基地，用于使国家军事化，用于制存原子弹，用于支持大批的特务与间谍，用于筹划策动在人民民主国家内的谋叛；此外又可节省几笔由于侵略性的外交政策所引起的支出。这样，不但财政预算得以平衡，而且尚有几十亿金元可用于急迫的国家事业——如建设学校或公共卫生事业，甚至可用以建设几个水堤，由于堤水之缺乏，纽约最近正缺少足够的水以冲洗厕所、洗衣甚至缺少饮水。
    但是，这样的一个简单的解决方法从未进入专家们和总统的脑中去的。在未来的财政年度中，几十亿人民的金钱，将被投入那冒险的外交政策和军备竞争的无底桶中去。（镇雄译自《新时代》一九五○年第一期）
