　　Fifty-Four-Year-Old Veteran Party Member Dong Lao Zheng Learns Over Two Thousand Characters in Two and a Half Years
    Correspondent for Ningjin County, Hebei Province  Tian Yingzhen
    "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." The fifty-four-year-old Communist Party member Dong Lao Zheng firmly believed in this principle, diligently studying characters, and in two and a half years, he remarkably learned over two thousand characters. Dong Lao Zheng is from Luqian Village, Sixth District, Ningjin, Hebei. At seventeen, he worked as a long-term laborer for landlords. In 1946, he actively participated in the land reform, and in 1947, he joined the Chinese Communist Party, serving as the village government chairman and a member of the village branch committee. Dong Lao Zheng's work style in the village was proactive and positive, and the masses supported him. Only one thing truly troubled him: being illiterate, he couldn't even write a receipt when someone delivered a letter, and he had to blush and ask for help. He often thought: How long can a seeing-eyed blind man like me keep this up!
    In July 1947, he attended a training class convened by the county Party committee. When the leaders lectured, they said, "Communist Party members must strengthen their studies; without learning, they cannot do their work." These words resonated with his concerns. So, he bravely expressed his desire to learn. With the help and encouragement of the leadership, he resolved: "I must study, I must become literate." In the training class, he studied while others rested. In half a month, he learned more than eighty characters, laying the foundation for future learning.
    After returning to the village, he worked even harder, making his own paper notebook and buying a pencil. Initially, he started by learning the names of the village, people, and cadres in his own village. Gradually, referring to the branch's teaching materials, he learned to write the rights and obligations of Party members. His learning methods were:
    (1) Three Inseparables: inseparable from his pencil, inseparable from his paper notebook, and inseparable from his small calico satchel. Whether attending meetings or going to the market, he always carried his learning tools. When people were not all present at meetings, he would find a quiet place to sit and study. During meetings, he recorded everything in his notebook. When working in the fields, he would take out his small notebook to learn to write characters during breaks. Satchel, pencil, and small paper notebook became his "portable treasures."
    (2) Three Non-Stop Activities: Besides production time during the day, he studied whenever he had free time, not even resting during lunch breaks. He also studied for an hour before going to bed at night. When it rained or on cloudy days when he couldn't work in the fields, this old student would run to the primary school to find teachers to teach him to write and recognize characters. This had become his daily habit and study system.
    (3) Two Fear Nots: Not afraid to ask people, not afraid to fail to learn. No matter the occasion, he would ask people who knew how to read, and he insisted on understanding everything clearly. Initially, some people dampened his spirits, saying, "Lao Zheng, do you still want to become a college student? I'm afraid you won't make it!" Lao Zheng was not discouraged by his age or these sarcastic remarks. He often replied to others' mockery with, "Nothing is difficult in the world, except the 'devil' of fear."
    (4) Achieving Three Competencies: Able to recognize, able to write, able to speak. Lao Zheng's learning attitude was very serious. He insisted on thoroughly understanding the recognition, writing, and speaking of each character before carefully writing it down in his small notebook. He never relaxed or was careless with a single character. To easily see the characters, he wrote commonly used phrases such as the rights and obligations of Party members, the benefits of planting cotton, and methods for establishing mutual aid groups in chalk all over the black walls of his three rooms. He recited them at least once every day, turning his three mud-brick rooms into his "cultural palace."
    Those with determination progress quickly. After two and a half years of hard work, he had already learned more than two thousand characters. Now he can take notes at meetings, and he can also understand the news in the Hebei Daily. He has reached the end of being a seeing-eyed blind man. He said: It was the Communist Party that opened my eyes.

　　五十四岁老党员董老正两年半学会二千多字
    河北宁晋县通讯干事  田頴真
    “天下无难事，只怕有心人”。五十四岁的共产党员文盲董老正认定了这个道理，苦心用功学认字，两年半的时间，他竟然学会了两千多字。董老正是河北宁晋六区路前村人。他十七岁就给地主扛长活，一九四六年积极参加土地改革，一九四七年参加了中国共产党，并担任村政府主席和村支部委员。董老正在村中工作积极作风好，群众都很拥护他。就是一件事情着实让他苦闷：自己一字不识，人家送信来，连个收条也不会开，还得红着脸去求人。他常想着：这睁眼的瞎子，可当到多时是头呀！
    一九四七年七月他到县委召开的训练班中去受训。上级讲课时说：“共产党员要加强学习，不学习就不会做工作。”这些话句句都说着他的心事。于是他勇敢地提出自己的学习要求。在领导上的帮助和鼓励下，他下定了决心：“要学习，要识字”。在训练班，人家休息他不休息，半月当中他学会了八十多个字，打下了以后的学习基础。
    回村后，他更加埋头苦干，自己做了个纸本子，买了枝铅笔。开头他先学本村的村名、人名、干部名，逐渐参照支部教材学写党员的权利和义务等。他的学习方法是：
    （一）三不离：不离铅笔、不离纸本、不离他那紫花布的小书包。无论是开会赶集，老是带着他那一套学习家具。开会人不齐的时候，他找个闲地方一坐就学起来。开会时，有一点事他都记在本子上。下地做活，一歇工就掏出小本子来学写字。书包、铅笔、小纸本，成了他行动不离的“随身宝”。
    （二）三不闲：白天除了生产时间外有空就学，歇晌时也不歇着。晚上睡觉前他还要学一个钟头。下雨阴天不能下地做活，这个老学生就跑到小学里去找教师教他写字认字。这已经成了他的生活习惯和学习制度。
    （三）两不怕：不怕问人，不怕学不会。无论在什么场合，见了识字的人就问，而且一定要问清楚。开初有人打击他的情绪说：“老正，你还想熬成个大学生吗？怕不沾了吧！”老正并不以年老和这些讽刺而灰心。他经常这样回答别人的讽刺：“世上无难事，光怕缠魔头。”
    （四）做到三会：会认、会写、会讲。老正的学习态度是非常认真的。每个字的认、写、讲，他一定要闹个透彻，然后才仔细的记在小本子上。他没有放松和马虎过一个字。为了抬头就看字，他住的那三间屋子里的黑墙上用粉笔写满了党员的权利和义务、种棉花的好处、成立互助组的方法等常用的字句。他每天最少要念一遍，这三间土坯房成了他的文化宫。
    有心的人进步快，二年半的埋头苦用功，他已经学会了两千多字。现在他开会能记录了，河北日报上的新闻他也能看懂了。睁眼的瞎子，他算当到了头。他说：这是共产党叫我睁开了眼。
