　　Improving Technology and Consolidating Mutual Aid
    The Party Branch of Dazhai Village, Yushe, Shanxi, Leads Production Experience
    Ma Ming, Liu Cun, Shu Mao
    The Dazhai administrative village (including four natural villages) branch is a model branch in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, for leading mass production. Because the branch paid attention to improving the internal Party organizational life, strengthening branch education, and receiving direct assistance from county and district leaders, it was able to unite the peasants of the whole village, combine improved technology with consolidating mutual aid organizations, and point out the path of labor mutual aid and production enrichment for the broad masses of working people. The village's agricultural production last year increased by 20% compared to the average of 1947 and 1948. Among them, the male labor force in Dazhai natural village decreased by 28% compared to the pre-war period, while grain income exceeded the pre-war level. There has also been great improvement in agricultural technology. Last autumn, out of 586 mu of wheat land in the village, 554 mu were treated with warm water soaking, and 35 jin of red alum were mixed in to prevent insect pests. At the same time, attention was paid to improving soil, selecting seeds in the field, and promoting improved varieties.

    The village branch has the following main experiences in leading mass production:

    I. Formulating Production Plans According to the Seasons

    The branch formulates two types of production plans: one is the annual production increase plan. Last year and this year, the branch has timely proposed annual goals and specific implementation methods. The other is the seasonal plan. In 1949, five plans were formulated according to different agricultural activities such as spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and planting, green manure and plowing wheat fields, the three autumns (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing), and winter production. Each season also had small plans according to production segments, all of which were guaranteed by mutual aid labor and technical improvement. These plans were first discussed and brewed by party members in mutual aid groups and among the masses, then the party groups of each natural village formulated village plans, and then the branch committee studied and revised them and the branch congress voted to make a resolution. After the branch formulated the plan, it was transformed into the plan of the whole village through the People's Congress. Then, party members, cadres, representatives, and activists went deep into mobilization and took the lead in practice, turning the plan into the actual actions of the masses. Because attention was paid to promoting democracy and concentrating the wisdom and experience of the masses in formulating the plan, the production enthusiasm of party members and the masses was stimulated, and the task was generally completed ahead of schedule. Last year's wheat harvest was originally planned for 20 days, but it was completed in 18 days. This not only enabled the branch to carry out its work proactively in a step-by-step and planned manner, but also overcame the blindness and fatigue in mass production.

    II. The Branch Leads the Masses to Organize and Participate in Production

    The 36 mutual aid groups in the entire administrative village include 70% of the households and 88% of the labor force. Among them, the Dazhai natural village is the best. Except for three old men around 60 years old, such as Zhang Zhucheng, all able-bodied male and female peasants in the village participated in organized labor in major agricultural and sideline production. The four mutual aid groups, groups three and four, were established two or three years ago, and groups one and two have a history of six years. The reason for this is primarily because the branch grasped the characteristic that mutual aid production is carried out on the basis of private individual economy and implemented the mutual aid policy of "voluntary mutual benefit." Moreover, in the mutual aid group, democracy was promoted and a system was established. Before 1949, the mutual aid group went through a tortuous road from its establishment to the present. The past problems were: no work was deducted when recording accounts, work evaluation was unfair, furniture was seized indiscriminately, and equivalent exchange was not implemented. In response, the branch led party members and activists to gradually implement the Party's mutual aid policy in the production movement. Democracy was promoted in the group, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. The "work ticket" system was implemented, and systems such as work recording were established. The methods of "on-site work evaluation" (evaluating every half day) and "flexible use of dead work" were adopted to ensure fair work evaluation. Accounts were cleared once a season and the groups met once a year, thus improving the masses' understanding, gradually changing the selfish ideas of some members, and increasing the mutual aid groups from 70% to 92% of the total households in 1945. This laid a favorable foundation for improving technology.

    III. Improving Agricultural Technology to Consolidate Mutual Aid Organizations

    On the basis of organization, an agricultural technology improvement movement was launched, breaking through the narrow meaning of overcoming labor difficulties at the beginning and developing into a production organization for collective labor to improve technology. As the environment changed from war to production and construction, a small number of peasants with good skills were no longer satisfied with the farming methods of "seeking speed regardless of quality" during the war, and they felt it was not as good as working alone. This reflected the need to combine organization with improved technology. However, most people with poor skills were not aware of this and felt that improving technology was troublesome: "Can you hoe millet into soybeans?!" Disputes continued, and Group Two split up once because of this. During spring planting last year, county-level leaders called for warm water seed soaking. Zhang Zhiquan, the branch propaganda committee member, was the only one in the village to respond. Most party members and the masses still had serious conservative ideas. Some said, "That's troublesome, if you plant millet, wheat won't come up." Branch Secretary Zhang Changfu did not soak the seeds either. After sowing, a field inspection revealed that Zhang Zhiquan's millet seedlings, which had been soaked, were neat and full, while the 25 mu of millet (not soaked) in the mutual aid group that the branch secretary participated in had to be planted three times before the seedlings caught. This actually educated the branch: only by leading the masses to improve technology can mutual aid groups, which have persisted for four or five years, continue to consolidate and develop. At the Party Day meeting, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and Branch Secretary Zhang Changfu proposed learning from Comrade Zhiquan. Party members and the masses also began to realize from their own experience that mutual aid production, coupled with technological improvements, could increase production. The whole administrative village established a technical committee, and each natural village established a technical team. Since then, the agricultural technology improvement movement, which runs through all seasons of the year, has been launched in a planned and led manner on the basis of the original organization. During the summer harvest last year, the branch formulated a 20-day plan based on the busy farming situation of wheat yellowing, millet growing, melon vines growing, seed selection, and plowing wheat fields: Use labor scientifically in the mutual aid groups! Fully able-bodied men harvest millet; experienced farmers plow wheat fields; mobilize more than a dozen women to cut wheat; eight or nine people to press melons; ten people to select wheat seeds in the fields. In terms of technological improvement, vivid slogans were proposed in combination with specific guidance: "Millet hoe one inch, fertilizer on top," "First hoe shallow, second hoe level," "Lightly press gourds, heavily press melons, clear the vines, clear the empty flowers," "To harvest wheat well, the plow is the guarantee." In this way, the mutual aid group has new content, which is more consolidated than before, and the work of the branch has also become active.

    IV. Launching "Inspection and Comparison" Campaigns to Break Conservative Ideas

    Through field visits and on-site inspections, the good experiences of peasants are promoted and conservatism and narrow-minded empiricism are overcome. In 1949, three mass "inspection and comparison" campaigns (field inspections, comparing technology, comparing crops, and comparing harvests) were carried out. At the beginning of the movement, due to the long-term conservatism and backwardness of peasants in agricultural technology, many difficulties were encountered. For example, in the past, it was customary to hoe millet only one month after the seedlings emerged. When the branch called for "hoeing millet when it is one inch high," some people said, "If you don't wait for the full moon to hoe, the small seedlings will die from navel wind." There was no custom of autumn plowing before the war. When the branch called for autumn plowing, some people said, "If you plow the stubble field in the autumn, the beans will not bear pods next year." These confused ideas were not fundamentally resolved until last year after the example education of the "inspection and comparison" movement. During the summer inspection and comparison, everyone saw with their own eyes that the millet hoed by Zhang Zhiquan when the seedlings were one inch high not only did not suffer from navel wind, but was particularly vigorous, dispelling the concerns about "hoeing millet when it is one inch high causing navel wind." They also saw that the 811 millet that Zhiquan had soaked in warm water under the weir was full of healthy seedlings and had no disease, while the millet of another family on the weir, with the same geological conditions and the same fertilizer application but without warm water soaking, grew unevenly and had to be planted three times before the seedlings caught. Other people's millet almost all had reed heart and black mold to varying degrees. Everyone truly realized the benefits of warm water soaking and improved seeds. During the autumn inspection and comparison, Zhang Yuwen harvested three shi and eight dou of beans from the three mu of millet stubble field that he had plowed in the autumn. Nianhai only harvested one shi and eight dou of beans from the three mu of millet stubble field that he had not plowed. Since then, the masses no longer believed the saying that "autumn plowing of millet stubble fields will not bear bean pods." In the past inspection and comparison, the advantages and disadvantages of good varieties and ordinary varieties of crops, and the amount of harvest were compared. The growth and harvest of crops with and without topdressing, with more or less fertilizer, and with or without cultivation techniques were compared. Peasants are realists. After such comparative example education, combined with science and technology, the good experiences of peasants were promoted, breaking the narrow and conservative ideas of the past, so that party members and the masses believed in science and believed in leadership.

    V. Summarizing Experiences and Evaluating Hero Models

    Timely summarize and exchange production experience, evaluate hero models, strengthen the ability of party members to lead production, and improve the scientific and technological level of the masses. Summaries and education were carried out from last summer's hoeing to the various production seasons of the three autumns; on the other hand, a comprehensive summary of the year's production was carried out after the autumn harvest. First, in the Party, taking the branch's production plan, the village's production achievements, and the production achievements of individual party members as standards, large and small meetings were held to examine the branch's leadership and appraise party members from the summary movement, and to commend those who actively labored and were able to organize the masses to implement the branch's resolutions in the production movement. Those party members who gradually changed from bad to good in the production process were praised for their skills, their advantages were explained, and their shortcomings were pointed out. Conversely, serious and earnest criticism was given to those who had consistently failed to actively produce and had deviated from the Party's resolutions. Among the masses, the production plans of the mutual aid groups were checked using dining halls, mutual aid groups, and agricultural activities, and the causes and effects of success and failure were identified. Secondly, the year's cultivation techniques were widely discussed from the comparison of harvests, the comparison of technology, and the comparison of organization. Twenty-four hero models and activists were evaluated, and powerful education was given to the feudal ideas of conservative and backward cultivation habits, disbelief in science, and contempt for women. This summary education made the masses of the whole village have a deep understanding of the glory of labor, responding to the Party's call, mutual aid production, paying attention to technology, and that man can conquer nature.

　　改良技术巩固互助
    山西榆社大寨村支部领导生产经验
    马明·柳村·树茂
    大寨行政村（包括四个自然村）支部，是山西省榆社县领导群众生产的模范支部。由于支部注意了健全党内组织生活，加强支部教育，并得到县区领导的直接帮助，因之能够团结全村农民，结合改良技术巩固互助组织，为广大劳动群众指出了劳动互助、生产致富的道路。全村去年农业生产较一九四七、一九四八两年平均增产二成。其中大寨自然村男劳力比战前减少百分之二十八，而粮食收入却超过了战前水平。农业技术上也有很大的改进。去秋种麦时全村五百八十六亩麦地，即有五百五十四亩实行温汤浸种，并搅拌了三十五斤红矾以防治虫害。同时还注意了改良土壤、田间选种和推广优良品种。
    该村支部在领导群众生产上主要有以下几个经验：
    一、根据季节订出生产计划
    支部制订的生产计划分两种：一种是全年的增产计划。去年和今年支部都适时地提出了全年的奋斗目标和具体实施办法。另一种是季节性的计划，一九四九年依据春耕下种、夏收夏种、压青肥垡麦地、三秋（秋收、秋耕、秋种）、冬季生产等不同农事活动订过五次计划。每个季节又按生产段落订有小计划，且均以互助劳动及技术改良作保证。这些计划，是党员先在互助组和群众中酝酿讨论，后经各自然村党的小组制订各村计划，再经过支委会研究修改和支部大会表决作出决议。支部订出计划后，又通过人民代表会，变成全村群众的计划。然后，由党员、干部、代表、积极分子深入动员和实际带头，把计划变为群众的实际行动。由于制订计划中注意发扬民主，集中群众智慧和经验，因此，激发了党员群众的生产积极性，一般均能提前完成任务。去年麦收原计划二十天，结果十八天完成。这样，既可使支部有步骤、有计划地主动进行工作；同时，也克服了群众生产中的盲目、疲塌现象。
    二、支部领导群众组织起来参加生产
    全行政村三十六个互助组，包括了全村百分之七十的户数，和百分之八十八的劳力。其中，大寨自然村最好，全村除张猪成等六十岁左右的三个老汉外，所有能劳动的男女农民在主要的农、副业生产上，都参加了有组织的劳动。四个互助组，三、四组成立二、三年，一、二组已有六年的历史。所以如此，首先是由于支部掌握了互助生产是在私有的个体经济基础上进行的这一特点，贯彻了“自愿互利”的互助政策。并在互助组中，发扬民主，建立制度。一九四九年以前，互助组从成立到现在曾经过了曲折的道路。过去的毛病，是：记账不折工、评工折工不公、乱抓家具和未能贯彻等价交换等。对此，支部曾领导党员、积极分子，在生产运动中，逐步贯彻党的互助政策。在组里发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评。实行“推工票”，建立了折工记工等制度。又采取了“就地评工”（半天一评）、“死工活用”等办法，保证评工公道。一季一清账，每年一碰组，因而提高了群众认识，逐渐改变了某些组员的本位自私思想，使互助组由一九四五年占全村户数的百分之七十增至百分之九十二。为提高技术打下有利基础。
    三、改良农业技术巩固互助组织
    在组织起来的基础上，展开农业技术改良运动，突破当初克服劳力困难的狭隘意义，发展成为集体劳动改进技术的生产组织。随着由战争环境转向生产建设，少数技术好的农民对战争中“图快不顾好”的耕作法已不满足，嫌做的不“如贴”。反映了组织起来必须与提高技术相结合的要求。但多数技术差的人还不自觉，嫌改进技术麻烦：“锄谷还能锄成豆子？！”争论不休，二组就因此一度分裂了。去年春种时，县级领导上号召温汤浸种。全村独有支部宣传委员张志全响应。大多数党员、群众保守思想仍很严重，有的说：“那倒麻烦，种上谷上不来麦子”，支部书记张昌福也没温种。下种后，田间实地检查：发现张志全经过温种的谷苗齐垄满，而支书参加的互助组二十五亩谷（未温种）连种三次才捉住苗。实际教育了支部：只有领导群众提高技术，坚持了四、五年的互助组才能继续巩固发展。在党日进行了批评与自我批评，支书张昌福提出向志全同志学习。党员、群众从亲身体验中也开始认识了互助生产，再加上技术改良，才能增产。全行政村成立了技术委员会，各自然村成立了技术小组。从此，贯串全年各个季节的农业技术改良运动，便在原有的组织起来的基础上，有计划有领导的展开了。去年夏收时，支部根据麦黄、谷大、瓜支秧、选种、垡麦地的农忙情况，订出了二十天计划：在互助组中科学使用劳力！男全劳力挽谷；技术老农垡麦地；发动妇女十余人割麦；八、九人压瓜；十人田间选麦种。在技术改良方面，结合具体指导提出生动的口号：“谷挽寸、顶上粪”，“头锄浅、二锄平”，“轻压葫芦重压瓜、打净支秧打空花”，“麦子要收好、犁杖作担保”。这样，互助组有了新的内容，较前巩固，支部工作也随之活跃起来。
    四、开展“查、比”运动，打破保守思想
    通过田间参观、实地检查，发扬农民中的好经验，克服保守、狭隘的经验主义。一九四九年开展了三次群众性的“查、比”运动（田间实地检查，比技术、比庄稼、比收成）。运动开始，由于农民在农业技术上的长期保守落后，遇到不少困难。比如以往习惯等苗出一月后才锄谷，支部号召“谷锄寸”时，有些人说：“不等满月锄，小苗中了脐风就死了。”战前没有秋垡地习惯，支部号召秋垡地，有些人便说：“秋天垡了谷茬地、下年种豆不结豆荚”。以上这些糊涂思想，直至去年经过“查、比”运动实例教育，才从根本上解决了。夏季查、比时，大家亲眼看见张志全谷苗一寸高时锄出来的谷，不但没中脐风、反而特别旺盛，解除了“谷锄寸、中脐风”的顾虑。又看见堰下志全经过温种的八一一谷，垄满苗壮，且无一株病害，堰上另一家地质相同并同样上粪但未温种的谷，却长的七高八低，三次才捉住苗。别人的谷则几乎多少都有芦心乌霉的。大家真正体会到温种和优种的好处。秋季查、比时，张玉文秋垡过的谷茬地，三亩豆子收获三石八斗。碾孩未垡谷茬的三亩豆子只打了一石八斗。从此，群众不再相信“秋垡谷茬地不结豆荚”的说法了。历次的查、比中，比较了优良品种和普通品种庄稼的好坏和收成多少。比较了上追肥与不上追肥，施肥多少、讲耕锄技术与不讲耕锄技术的庄稼长的好坏和收成多少。农民是现实主义者，经过这样对比的实例教育，结合科学技术，发扬农民中的好经验，打破了过去狭隘，保守思想，使党员群众相信了科学，相信了领导。
    五、总结经验评选英雄模范
    及时总结，交流生产经验，评选英雄模范，加强党员领导生产能力，提高群众科学技术水平。从去年夏锄直至三秋中各个生产季节的各段都进行了总结教育；另一方面秋收后又进行了全年生产大总结。首先在党内以支部生产计划、全村生产成绩，和党员个人生产成绩作标准，召开大、小会，从总结运动检查支部领导、鉴定党员，对积极劳动并能在生产运动中组织群众贯彻支部决议者，进行表扬。对在生产过程中逐渐由坏变好的党员表扬一技之长，说明优点指出缺点。反之，对一贯不积极生产和离开党的决议的错误行为，进行了严肃，认真的批评。在群众中则利用饭场、互助组、农事活动，检查了互助组的生产计划是否完成；并找出成败的因果。其次，从比收成、比技术、比组织中，广泛座谈了一年来的耕作技术，评选出英雄模范积极分子二十四人，并给了守旧落后的耕作习惯，不相信科学，轻视妇女等封建思想以有力教育。这种总结教育，使全村群众对劳动光荣，响应党的号召，互助生产，讲究技术，和人定胜天等有了深刻的认识。
