Henan Province's Famous Cotton Producing Area
　　Shanzhou Neglects Cotton Planting Leadership
　　Should Seize the Season to Organize Cotton Farmers to Rush Planting
　　[Our Newspaper's News] The cotton fields in Shanxian, Lingbao, and Wenxiang counties, famous cotton producing areas in Henan Province, have generally begun sowing. However, due to the neglect of leadership by the county and district governments, the failure to address the concerns of cotton farmers, and deviations in the issuance of cotton loans, the farmers' cotton planting plans are still far from the region's plan to increase cotton acreage. Last year, the seven counties in the Shanzhou Special District planted a total of 417,000 mu of cotton fields. Shanxian, Lingbao, and Wenxiang counties planted 337,000 mu, accounting for more than four-fifths of the total cotton acreage in the district. Of the 700 million yuan in cotton fertilizer loans lent to the Shanzhou Special District by the Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China, 610 million yuan was allocated to Shan, Ling, and Wen counties. The Provincial Department of Agriculture lent 150,000 jin of No. 4 Si Zi American cotton seeds and dispatched working groups to Daying in Shanxian, Changjiawan in Lingbao, and Jinpen in Wenxiang to guide cotton farmers in sowing and establish high-quality seed breeding areas. At the special district production meeting held in early February (attended by county heads and heads of the industry departments of each county), the Shanzhou Special District arranged to increase cotton acreage by 93,000 mu this year, of which Shan, Ling, and Wen counties were to increase 82,000 mu. The No. 4 Si Zi American cotton seeds were lent out separately in early March, and the cotton fertilizer loans were lent out from mid-March to April 5th.
　　However, due to the neglect of agricultural production leadership by the county and district governments, the loans were only seen as the bank's business. They did not actively cooperate with the bank to purchase fertilizer and lend it to cotton farmers. All the loans issued were in cash. Moreover, county and district governments generally took a purely task-oriented view of organizing the masses to borrow money. Many loan groups were temporarily established by administrative order without democratic evaluation or careful review of loan recipients. After the loans were issued, they were considered "all done." As a result, deviations occurred in the loan issuance in most areas: some cotton farmers who already had fertilizer also received loans, some landlords and rich peasants also received loans, and some people in some areas were afraid to borrow money, so village cadres took the opportunity to monopolize the loans of several people. After the loans were issued, some cotton farmers used them as working capital for sideline production, and some bought grain to eat. According to the statistics of the Lingbao County branch of the People's Bank of China, 50 percent of the 206 million yuan in cotton fertilizer loans borrowed in two districts of the county was eaten up.
　　Since the Industry Department of the Shanzhou Special Commissioner's Office arranged the work of increasing cotton acreage in the entire district in early February, it has not conducted a single inspection and still does not know whether this year's plan to increase cotton acreage can be completed. The Shan, Ling, and Wen county governments have not paid attention to it since the Special Commissioner's Office assigned the task of increasing cotton acreage. They have not held a single special meeting to study it, nor have they made a single specific arrangement. To date, the three county governments do not understand the cotton sowing situation and have no certainty about the task of increasing cotton acreage. Cadres of the Wenxiang County and District governments believe that "the Provincial Department of Agriculture's working group is here to do the work of increasing cotton acreage," so they relaxed their responsibilities and neglected leadership. Because cotton farmers saw that the local price of cotton was currently low and the price of grain was high, with one jin of cotton only exchanging for four jin of wheat, they had no confidence in increasing cotton acreage and felt that it was safer to grow more grain. And cadres in various places did not seize the opportunity to conduct publicity and explanation to cotton farmers to dispel their concerns, so the cotton acreage expanded by cotton farmers in various places was still far from the Special Commissioner's Office's production increase plan, and the cotton acreage in some areas even tended to decrease compared with last year. For example, Wenxiang County planted more than 100,680 mu of cotton last year, and the Special Commissioner's Office arranged to increase production by 20,000 mu this year. According to the statistics of the working group sent by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee to investigate cotton production, the county has a total of more than 93,700 mu of fields that have been sown and planned to be planted with cotton this year, a decrease of 13,100 mu compared with last year. Chengguan District of the county planted more than 31,930 mu of cotton last year, while a total of 23,000 mu of fields have been sown and planned to be planted with cotton this year, a decrease of 8,930 mu compared with last year. After the lending of improved varieties and the technical guidance of the working group of the Department of Agriculture, Daying District of Shanxian County can maintain last year's cotton planting area, but there is still no sign of increase.
　　It is currently the cotton sowing season. After a rain at the end of last month, cotton in various places has generally begun to be sown spontaneously around the Qingming Festival (the 5th of this month). The cotton fields in Daying District of Shanxian County were all plowed before the Qingming Festival, and 75 percent were plowed twice. From Qingming Festival to now, half of the cotton fields have been sown. The 30,720 mu of cotton fields in Chengguan District of Lingbao County have generally been plowed once and have also generally begun to be sown since Qingming Festival. More than 93,700 mu of cotton fields in the entire Wenxiang County have generally been plowed once, and 40 percent of the cotton fields have been sown. However, most of the above sowing was carried out spontaneously by the masses. Governments at all levels have not regarded the plan to increase cotton acreage this year as an arduous task to be completed. The cotton farmers in Shan, Ling, and Wen have a saying: "Early Qingming, late Lixia, it is the right time to plant cotton around Guyu." Now that the Guyu Festival has passed, the fields planned by cotton farmers for cotton planting will soon be fully sown. If governments at all levels do not quickly seize the leadership and continue to let it go its own way, then the plan of the Special Commissioner's Office to increase cotton acreage by 82,000 mu in the three counties this year will be difficult to complete.

### 河南省著名棉产地  陕州忽视种棉领导  应抓住节令组织棉农抢种

　　河南省著名棉产地
    陕州忽视种棉领导
    应抓住节令组织棉农抢种
    【本报讯】河南省著名产棉区陕县、灵宝、阌乡的棉田，已普遍开始播种。但由于各县、区政府忽视领导，未注意解除棉农顾虑，在发放棉贷款中发生偏差，农民种棉计划与全区增植棉田计划相差尚远。陕州专区七个县，去年共种棉田四十一万七千亩。陕县、灵宝、阌乡三县便种了三十三万七千亩，占全专区种棉面积的五分之四强。今年人民银行河南分行贷给陕州专区的七亿元棉肥贷款中，分配给陕、灵、阌三县者占六亿一千万元。由省农业厅贷给四号斯字美棉种籽十五万斤，并派出工作组分别到陕县大营、灵宝常家湾、阌乡金盆指导棉农播种，创立良种繁殖区。陕州专区在二月初旬的专区生产会议（各县县长、实业科长参加）上，布置今年全区增植棉田九万三千亩，其中陕、灵、阌三县要增八百二千亩。四号斯字美棉种籽已于三月上旬分别贷下，棉肥贷款于三月中旬到四月五日贷放完毕。
    但由于各县、区政府忽视领导农业生产，把贷款只看成是银行的事，未主动与银行配合购买肥料贷给棉农，贷下的全是现款。而且各县、区政府对组织群众借款，大都抱着单纯任务观点，只是临时由行政命令成立许多借款小组，未进行民主评议，未认真审查贷款对象，贷款发下便“万事大吉”。结果大部地区贷款发生了偏差：有的已有肥料的棉农也领了贷款，有的地主富农也领了贷款，有的地区群众有顾虑不敢借款，村干部乘机一人独占几个人的贷款。在贷款发下后，有的棉农移作副业生产资金，有的便购粮食吃了。据人民银行灵宝县行的统计：该县两个区所借两亿零六百万元的棉肥贷款中，有百分之五十被吃掉了。
    陕州专署实业科自二月初旬布置了全区增植棉田工作后，尚未作过一次检查，至今仍不知今年增植棉田计划能否完成。陕、灵、阌三县政府，自专署布置增植棉田的任务后，皆未重视，未召开过一次专门会议研究，未作过一次具体布置，至今该三县政府，对棉花播种情况皆不了解，对增植棉田的任务没有把握。阌乡县、区政府干部认为：“增植棉田工作，有省农业厅工作组在这里搞。”便放松责任，忽视领导。棉农因看到目前当地棉贱粮贵，一斤棉花只换四斤小麦，对增植棉田没有信心，觉得不如多种粮食保险。而各地干部未抓紧对棉农进行宣传解释，解除棉农顾虑，使各地棉农扩大种棉面积，较专署增产计划相差尚远，且有些地区的棉田已有较去年减少的趋势。如阌乡县去年种棉十万零六千八百多亩，今年专署布置增产两万亩。据中南军政委员会农林部派来调查棉产情况的工作组统计，今年该县已进行播种及计划种棉的田地加在一起，共九万三千七百多亩，较去年减少一万三千一百亩。该县城关区去年种棉三万一千九百三十余亩，而今年已播种及计划种棉的田地共两万三千亩，较去年减少八千九百三十余亩。陕县大营区经贷放良种及农业厅工作组的技术指导，可维持去年植棉面积，但亦尚无增加的迹象。
    目前正值棉花播种季节，上月末下过一场雨后，各地棉花在清明节（本月五日）前后已普遍的自发开始播种。陕县大营区棉田在清明节前已全部犁完，百分之七十五犁两遍。从清明节到现在，已有二分之一的棉田下种，灵宝城关区三万零七百廿亩棉田普遍翻过一次，亦从清明节起普遍开始播种。阌乡全县九万三千七百多亩棉田普遍犁过一次，已有百分之四十的棉田完成播种。但上述播种大多是群众自发进行的，各级政府对今年增植棉田的计划则未当作一项艰巨的任务去完成。陕、灵、阌棉农有句谚语：“清明早，立夏迟，谷雨前后种棉正当时”。现谷雨节已过，棉农打谱种棉的田地即将全部播种，各级政府如不迅速抓紧领导，继续听其自流，则专署布置该三县今年增植棉田八万二千亩的计划，即难完成。（塞）
