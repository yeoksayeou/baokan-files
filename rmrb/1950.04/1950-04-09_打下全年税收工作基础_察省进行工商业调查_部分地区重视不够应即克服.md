(From our newspaper) According to the Chahar Daily News of April 1st: The Chahar Provincial Taxation Bureau, in order to further understand and grasp the basic situation of industry and commerce in the province, so as to stipulate various specific methods, balance the burden, and lay the foundation for the year's tax revenue work, has decided that the industrial and commercial survey is the central task for March and April. In the past half month, it has been discovered that many commercial households have serious cases of concealment and false reporting. This work began successively on March 15th and is now fully underway in southern Chahar, northern Chahar, northern Yanmen, and the three cities of Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong. More than 50 cadres from Zhangjiakou participated, with key cadres leading the work personally. On March 17th, a meeting of the chairmen of various industry associations was held, calling for truthful declarations. On March 18th, the provincial working groups started activities separately, conducting typical household surveys of major industries. By March 28th, surveys of 16 industries had been completed. Datong City established a survey committee on March 19th, drawing 34 cadres from the government and state-owned enterprises to assist in the work. On March 22nd, typical household surveys began, starting with major industries such as cotton cloth, dried and fresh fruits, and flour milling. Xuanhua City established a survey committee on February 27th and started work on March 1st. The hotel industry has now been evaluated, and typical household surveys of flour, groceries, and general merchandise are underway. The affiliated Xiayuan Town has also started work. The survey work in various counties of the southern Chahar Special Zone has been largely completed. The northern Chahar Special Zone has organized 31 provincial and special zone cadres to go to Duolun, Shangdu, Zhangbei, and other counties to carry out the work. The northern Yanmen Special Zone is focusing on Yanggao, where the most problems were found in last year's survey, drawing on experience, and gradually starting surveys in Hunyuan, Shuoxian, and other places. In the survey, all localities generally adhered to the three principles of typical surveys, self-reporting and public discussion, and democratic evaluation to allocate tax burdens. However, there are still some problems in some local work units: 1. Some leading cadres have not paid enough attention to the industrial and commercial survey and lack enthusiasm. When the survey committee was established, few or no principal heads of various departments participated (such as in Xuanhua). Some departments emphasized departmental work and failed to cooperate with this central task. Some places are eager to achieve quick results, believing that this work is old hat, and there is nothing different this year from last year, so they do it carelessly; some focus on evaluation and neglect investigation; some do not pay attention to grasping specific situations and authentic materials; some are satisfied with the achievements of last year's survey and do not intend to put in more effort; there are also phenomena of universally selecting chamber of commerce cadres or chairmen as typical cases for checking accounts, which urgently needs to be overcome.

　　Numerous Schemes of False Reporting Discovered Among Commercial Households
    During the provincial industrial and commercial survey, it was discovered that many commercial households seriously concealed and falsely reported information, with all kinds of deceptive tricks. The most common form of false reporting is: deliberately lowering the closing inventory valuation at the end of 1948 and raising the closing inventory valuation at the end of 1949, to show losses or very little profit. Some reduced the inventory of furniture in their shops, some valued the inventory even lower than 20% of the purchase cost, and some described the capital and accumulated profits as security deposits or "floating matters" (meaning temporarily stored in the counter) of the shop assistants to reduce the capital. Yongfahe Grocery in Zhangjiakou City, used this method to reduce net profits, amounting to 300,000 catties of millet in just two items. Some dispersed their inventory, not recording goods stored in other locations or claiming they were deposited by customers when discovered. Some did not record transactions in Tianjin in the cash flow ledger to reduce turnover and expand expenses, falsely reporting income. For example, Taiheyu Chinese medicine shop in Zhangjiakou City, falsely reported that each shop assistant was given four sets of clothing every year since the first liberation, which was found to be untrue after investigation. They had two meals a day, one of coarse grains and one of fine grains, falsely reporting that each person's monthly expenditure was 130 catties of millet, which was also inconsistent with the facts after investigation. Some even deducted the second phase of public bonds in advance as expenses. Heshengcheng Fur Shop, used this method to deduct expenses equivalent to 80 bolts of foreign cloth. In addition, some cadres were not appropriate in dividing fixed assets and current assets, calculating the production cycle, and classifying peddlers and seated merchants. Therefore, the provincial industrial and commercial survey guidance group, based on the above situation, put forward the following suggestions: 1. Although some industrial and commercial households have numerous tricks for concealing and falsely reporting, as long as we go deep, understand from multiple aspects, focus on checking accounts, discover problems, and investigate problems, the tricks can be exposed. 2. Strengthen cadre learning, discuss more when encountering difficulties, discover problems, solve them in a timely manner, and exchange experiences. 3. Strengthen policy propaganda based on merchants' concerns. 4. Grasp the situation, strengthen the special county reporting system, summarize materials in a timely manner, study problems, and improve work.

　　打下全年税收工作基础
    察省进行工商业调查       
    部分地区重视不够应即克服
    【本报讯】据四月一日察哈尔日报消息：察省税务局为了进一步了解与掌握本省工商业基本情况，以便规定各种具体办法，平衡负担，打下全年税收工作基础，特决定工商业调查是三、四月份的中心工作，半月来在调查中并曾发现不少商业户有严重匿报假报情事。此项工作于三月十五日先后开始，现已在察南、察北、雁北和张家口、宣化、大同三市全面展开。张家口有五十多名干部参加，主要干部亲自领导。三月十七日召开了各行业理事长会议，号召真实申报。三月十八日该省工作组分头活动，分别进行主要行业典型户调查，至三月二十八日已调查完十六个行业。大同市三月十九日成立了调查委员会，从政府及公营企业抽出三十四名干部帮助工作，三月二十二日开始典型户调查，先从布棉、干鲜果、磨面等主要行业进行。宣化市于二月二十七日成立调查委员会，三月一日即已开始工作。现旅店业已评议完毕，面粉、杂货、百货正进行典型户调查。所属下花园镇也开始工作。察南专区各县调查工作已大部完成。察北专区已组织省、专干部三十一人分赴多伦、商都、张北等县进行工作。雁北专区以去年调查存在问题最多的阳高为重点，吸取经验，逐步在浑源、朔县等地开始调查。各地在调查中，一般的都紧紧掌握了典型调查、自报公议、民主评定三原则分配税款负担；但尚有部分地区个别工作单位还存在一些问题：一、有些领导干部对工商业调查，尚未引起足够重视且劲头不足，成立调查委员会时各部门主要负责人参加很少或不出席（如宣化）。有的部门强调部门工作，未能配合这一中心工作。有些地方是急于求成，认为这一工作是老一套，今年和去年没有什么不同，因而粗枝大叶的做一下；有的着重评议，忽视调查；有的未注意掌握具体情况和真实材料；有的满足于去年调查成绩，不拟再用大力进行；还有的普遍选择商会干部或理事长当典型进行查账等现象都亟待克服。
            查出不少商业户虚报的花样繁多
    在全省工商业调查中，发现不少商业户严重匿报假报，且欺骗花样百出。其中最普遍的虚报方式是：如把一九四八年年底盘存折实作价故意作低，把一九四九年底盘存则作高，显得赔本，或很少盈余。有的把家具铺底盘存缩小，有的把盘存作价竟低于购入成本百分之二十，有的把资金和积累的利润说是伙计们的保证金或浮事（柜上暂存的意思），以缩小资本。张市杂货行永发和，用此办法缩小纯利，仅二宗即达小米三十万斤。有的分散存货，存放在外埠的货物不记账或查出后说是客人寄存的。有的到天津买卖货物不记入流水账，以缩小营业额，扩大开支，虚报收入。如张市中药业泰和玉，假报柜上伙计从第一次解放迄今，每人每年发给服装四套，经调查并非如此。他们一日两餐，粗细粮各一顿，假报每月每人开支小米一百三十斤，经调查也与事实不合。有的甚至将第二期公债也做为开支预先扣除。皮毛业合顺成，用此办法扣除开支合洋布八十匹。另外有些干部在划分固定资金和流动资金、计算生产周期、划分摊贩与座商等。均有不够恰当的地方。因此省工商业调查指导组，根据上述情况提出今后几个意见：一、虽然有些工商户匿报假报花样繁多，但只要深入，多方面了解，重点查账，发现问题，追究问题，花样即可能被揭破。二、加强干部学习，碰到难题多讨论，发现问题，及时解决，交流经验。三、根据商户顾虑，加强政策宣传。四、掌握情况，加强专县报告制度，及时总结材料，研究问题改进工作。
