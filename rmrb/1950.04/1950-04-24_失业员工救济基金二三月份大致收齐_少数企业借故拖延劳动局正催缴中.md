　　Unemployment Relief Fund Mostly Collected in February and March
    A Few Enterprises Delaying on Pretexts, Labor Bureau Urging Payment
    [News from the Beijing Municipal News Bureau] According to the "Beijing Municipality Trial Implementation Rules for Relief of Unemployed Employees," the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau began in February of this year to collect monthly relief funds equivalent to one percent of the total wages from employees and factory owners of public (including government production units) and private enterprises and factories with more than ten people in the city. As of April 20th, the collection of relief funds for February and March has been basically completed. The collection for April has also begun.

    Among state-owned enterprises and factories in Beijing, except for seven units, including the Third Branch Factory of the Machine General Factory under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which recently received orders and have already handled payment procedures, the factories under the North China Transportation General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications have not yet completed payment procedures. In addition, the workers of the Beijing Postal Administration have already paid the relief funds for February and March, but the bureau has not yet completed the procedures. Among municipal enterprises and factories, except for the coal mines and brick kilns, whose production nature is still under study and decision, and the Beijing Tram Company, which did not pay in February, all other units have paid for February and March. Among public enterprises, the payment situation in the government production sector is relatively poor. The main reason is that the leading cadres in these enterprises and factories have not attached importance to this work ideologically. For example, the Xinxing Flour Mill under the leadership of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China has been repeatedly negotiated and persuaded by the Labor Bureau, but it is still delaying. Among the small number of private enterprises and factories that have not completed payment procedures, most are due to temporary workers or unresolved labor disputes. However, there are also individual capitalists who deliberately delay the payment time on pretexts or secretly dismiss workers in an attempt to avoid payment. For example, Chen Qiming, the manager of Zhencheng Soap Factory in the Eighth District, dismissed eleven workers after the relief rules were announced, and spread rumors to threaten workers, preventing them from going to the Labor Bureau to appeal. He said: "If you go to the Labor Bureau, don't think about coming back. Who knows where they will send you to do hard labor!" When workers demanded dismissal compensation, he said: "If you don't listen to me, I will send you to the Labor Bureau." As a result, he forced the workers to go home. Some capitalists, such as those at the Yixing Iron Factory in the Fifth District and the Longtai Weaving Factory in the Sixth District, secretly dismissed workers after the relief rules were announced, reducing the number of employees to less than ten in an attempt to avoid implementing the rules. Others changed long-term workers to temporary workers to deprive workers of the right to enjoy relief.

    The Labor Bureau is conducting further investigations into these enterprises and factories that are delaying the payment of relief funds, so as to conduct persuasion, warnings, or transfer to the court for punishment according to the severity of the circumstances.

　　失业员工救济基金二三月份大致收齐
    少数企业借故拖延劳动局正催缴中
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府劳动局根据“北京市救济失业员工试行细则”的规定，自今年二月份起，开始按月向本市十人以上之公营（包括机关生产）及私营企业工厂的职工和厂方征收工资总额百分之一的救济基金，到四月二十日止，二三月份救济基金的征收工作已基本完成。四月份亦已开始征收。
    京市国营企业工厂，除重工业部所属机器总厂第三分厂、石景山钢铁厂等七个单位最近才接到命令已洽办交纳手续外，尚有交通部华北运输总局所属各厂没有办理交纳手续。此外，北京邮政管理局的工人已交纳了二、三月份救济基金，而局方到现在还没有办理手续。市营企业工厂，除煤矿、砖窑两业，因生产性质尚待研究决定及北京电车公司二月份未交外，其余单位二、三月份已全部交纳。在公营企业中以机关生产部分交纳情况较差。主要原因是由于这些企业工厂中的领导干部，在思想上就没有重视这一工作，如中国人民银行总行所领导的新兴面粉厂，劳动局曾多次向该厂交涉说服，到现在还拖延未办。私营企业工厂未办交纳手续的少数单位中，多因临时工或劳资争议未解决所致。但其中也有个别资方，故意借词拖延交纳时间，或暗中解雇工人，企图不缴。如八区振成造胰厂经理陈其铭在救济细则公布后，就解雇了十一个工人，并造谣威胁工人，不让到劳动局去申诉，他说：“去劳动局就别想再回来了，还不知道把你们送到那里去做苦工哩！”工人要求解雇费，他又说：“你们如果再不听话，我就送你们到劳动局去”，结果迫使工人回家去了。五区义兴铁工厂、六区隆泰织布厂等资方，在救济细则公布后，有的暗地解雇工人，把职工人数减到十人以下，企图不执行细则规定，有的把长工改为临时工，以剥夺工人享受救济的权利。
    劳动局对这些拖延不交救济基金的企业工厂，正作进一步的调查，以便按其情节轻重，分别进行说服、警告，或移转法院惩处。
