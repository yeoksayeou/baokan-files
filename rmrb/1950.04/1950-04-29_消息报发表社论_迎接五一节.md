　　Message Newspaper Publishes Editorial
    Welcoming May Day
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th] TASS, Moscow, 27th: The Message Newspaper published an editorial stating: Our powerful motherland, as the vanguard of all progressive mankind, welcomes May Day as the hope and fortress of the ever-growing camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    The People's Democratic countries, advancing along the path of socialist construction, warmly respond to the Soviet people's fraternal May Day greetings. The great Chinese people, who have already won a historic victory in the struggle against imperialism and its Kuomintang running dogs, also hear our fraternal and militant greetings. The ordinary people of all countries around the world will warmly and sincerely respond to these calls: Working people of all countries! Expose the sinister plans of the warmongers! Expand and strengthen the powerful front of peace defenders! Defending peace is the cause of all the people of the world!
    The struggle for peace unites hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world, and the struggle for peace has cultivated their love for the Soviet Union—as the most resolute and selfless fighter for peace, as the standard-bearer of the idea of friendship and brotherhood among all nations.
