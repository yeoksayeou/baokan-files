　　American Imperialist Adventurist Policies Are Bound to Fail
　　*Pravda* Commentary on the American Plane's Outrageous Act of Intrusion into Soviet Airspace
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th] TASS Moscow, 13th: *Pravda* published on its front page an article by Nikolai Goryayev entitled "Suspicious Dealings of American Adventurers," commenting on the facts related to the intrusion of a US military aircraft into the southern airspace of Libau on the Soviet border. The article concludes: American adventurers are running rampant. They are implementing their "total diplomacy" policy, embarking on increasingly frequent adventures, attempting to dominate the world, and unscrupulously pursuing this goal. However, without a doubt, their adventurist policies, this time as well, are bound to fail.
