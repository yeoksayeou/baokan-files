　　Shandong Military Region Issues Instructions
    Implement Agricultural Production, Cease Commercial Activities
    Thoroughly Correct Policy-Violating and Illegal Behaviors
    [Reported by this newspaper] On April 7th, the Shandong Military Region Headquarters and Political Department issued instructions regarding the continued vigorous implementation of agricultural labor production, the immediate cessation of commercial activities, and the thorough correction of policy-violating and illegal behaviors. The text is as follows:

    Based on the current state of troop production, all regions and departments have enthusiastically studied and been educated on Chairman Mao's instructions regarding the participation of troops in production and construction work in 1950, and have studied how to implement them. All agencies and troops have formulated plans and issued instructions. Since the beginning of spring, a large amount of labor has been mobilized, engaging in land reclamation, planting, vegetable gardening, pig raising, fertilizer accumulation, grass collection, fishing, and other labor production with selfless spirit and high production enthusiasm, as well as sideline production tailored to local conditions. Preliminary achievements have been made in accordance with the production tasks stipulated for the spring season. At the same time, achievements have also been made in saving grain, firewood, and office supplies, and in providing relief to families of revolutionary martyrs and disaster victims. This is due to the active efforts of leading agencies at all levels and the vast number of commanders, fighters, and support personnel in correctly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on production and construction work, resulting in initial achievements. This will play an active role in increasing the wealth of the country and society, and will lay the foundation for completing a larger task of production self-sufficiency. This is a good thing. It is required that Party committees and leading agencies at all levels continue to work hard in the area of agricultural labor production in order to create even greater and better achievements. However, in some industrial, transportation, and military cooperative enterprises operated by our agencies and troops, serious policy-violating and illegal behaviors such as buying and selling short, speculation, and trading have recently been discovered in individual production units. For example, the Shengjian Company prepaid 490 million yuan to the Jiawang Coal Mine Company for the purchase of light rails, which was delayed for nearly half a year. The rails were not delivered, and it was only after the Jiawang Coal Mine Company filed a complaint with the military and political authorities that the matter was discovered and dealt with. Subsequently, it was discovered that they had sold grain and cotton last year, and in February of this year, they resold sixty freight cars; the Qinjiang Company, which was opened in Jinan last September by the Officers' Corps of the People's Liberation Army, also engaged in the resale of freight cars and commercial activities. It is understood that the production units led by the Xuzhou Garrison 2nd Brigade are also said to have violated policies. These policy-violating and illegal behaviors should serve as a warning. In addition to conducting a strict self-criticism, requesting punishment from higher authorities to educate the entire Party and the entire army, and organizing a work team to conduct a thorough inspection and rectification of the company, and immediately correct such policy-violating and illegal behaviors, we specifically instruct Party committees and military and political leaders at all levels to conduct a serious review of the production departments and production personnel under your leadership in accordance with Chairman Mao's policy on production and construction work: "With the permission of the People's Government, agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, water conservancy, handicrafts, various construction projects, various industries that can be engaged in, and transportation should be the scope, and commercial activities are prohibited." If there are similar behaviors of buying and selling short, speculation, engaging in commerce, seeking exorbitant profits, thereby violating policies, and violating laws and disciplines in the thinking and behavior of cadres, effective measures should be taken immediately to stop and correct them. Leading agencies at all levels must clearly recognize the production policy of "increasing national and social wealth through labor, starting from long-term construction," and use this powerful weapon to conduct universal education in the troops, in order to enable the entire Party and the entire army, under the great illumination of Chairman Mao, to resolutely implement and complete our glorious and arduous production tasks, and immediately and effectively stop and correct speculative behaviors involving commercial activities. To this end, the following instructions are hereby given:

    (1) Party committees, military and political leaders at all levels, and production committees at all levels should seriously study the instructions on production and construction work, correctly grasp production policies, clearly stipulate production tasks, review production plans, and effectively supervise and inspect the implementation of production plans, specifically understand the implementation situation, immediately take effective measures to stop commercial activities, and strictly correct all policy-violating and law-breaking behaviors.

    (2) Political organs at all levels should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on the participation of troops in production and construction work in 1950 and the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work, conduct extensive and in-depth education in the troops in conjunction with your actual situation. Emphasis should be placed on discussion and research in production departments and among production personnel to establish correct concepts of production and construction and strictly correct and prevent deviations that may arise in production and construction.

    (3) After the production policy education, Party committees and military and political leaders at all levels should immediately launch a democratic inspection, send capable work teams or groups, and, if necessary, the leaders should personally inspect the production units and production personnel under their jurisdiction to see if there are any illegal behaviors such as speculation, trade smuggling, buying and selling short, hoarding, attempting to make exorbitant profits, and competing with the people for profit, and all similar behaviors. Conduct a democratic inspection of this situation, make resolutions to achieve timely and effective prevention and correction. After democratic inspection and education, those who dare to continue to violate the law should be given due punishment according to the severity of the circumstances in order to restore political influence and educate the entire army.

    (4) Strengthen the ideological and organizational leadership of the entire Party, the entire army, and all production departments and production personnel, explain policies clearly, clarify directions and tasks, improve the level of political awareness, overcome blindness and the muddled notion of only caring about making money regardless of the impact, establish policy concepts, national legal concepts, and overall concepts. Strictly enforce the system of rewards and punishments, and resolutely wage a serious struggle against all behaviors that violate policies and laws and disciplines, and all unhealthy tendencies.

    (5) Strengthen discipline, strictly implement the reporting system stipulated by the military region, thoroughly correct all tendencies of indiscipline and anarchism, and the bad habit of not requesting instructions or reporting on policy-related or major issues. At the same time, we also oppose the bureaucratic style of leadership that is not tightly grasped, is not strictly supervised, and does not conduct thorough inspections. This is to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the Shengjian Company, in order to ensure that the production tasks for 1950 are implemented and completed.

    Finally, Party committees and military and political leaders at all levels, it is hoped that after receiving these instructions, you will immediately, in accordance with the spirit of these instructions and Chairman Mao's instructions on production and construction work, and the State Council's decision on the unification of national finance and economics, combine them with your actual situation, and first conduct discussions and research among yourselves, and through you conduct in-depth communication and education in the troops and agencies, in production departments and among production personnel, and conduct serious and thorough inspections, and effectively correct all erroneous behaviors and unhealthy tendencies. Especially in the case where the task of production for self-sufficiency may be even greater, it is required that you grasp the policy more closely and be vigilantly aware of any tendencies that may occur. Call on the entire Party and the entire army to actively work together, correct shortcomings, rectify mistakes, overcome difficulties, and strive to thoroughly complete the great production tasks given to us by Chairman Mao.

    【本报讯】山东军区司令部及政治部于四月七日发出关于继续大力贯彻农业劳动生产立即停止商业活动彻底纠正破坏政策与违法行为的指示，文如下：
    根据目前部队生产情况，各地各部都热烈的进行了毛主席关于一九五○年部队参加生产建设工作指示的学习和教育，并研究了如何执行，各机关部队都订出了计划，和颁发了指示。自开春以来，动员了广大劳动力，以忘我的精神和高度的生产热情，进行开荒、种地、种菜、喂猪、积肥、拾草、捕鱼等劳动生产，和因地制宜的副业生产，按照春季所规定的生产任务，已做出了初步的成绩。同时在节约粮柴办公用品，救济烈军属与灾胞工作上，也已获得了成绩。这是由于各级领导机关和广大的指战员，勤杂人员，积极努力，正确的执行了毛主席生产建设工作的指示，所获得的初步成果。从而给我们增进国家与社会财富，将起着积极的推动作用，并奠定了完成更大的生产自给任务的基础，这是好的一方面。要求各级党委与领导机关，继续从事农业劳动生产方面上去努力，以期创造出更大更好的成绩来。但在我们机关部队经营的某些工业、运输业及军人合作社等企业部门中，近来已发现了个别的生产单位有买空卖空，投机取巧，经营贸易等严重的破坏政策与违法行为。如生建公司给贾汪煤矿公司代购轻便铁轨，预支四亿九千万元，拖欠将近半年，未付铁轨，后经贾汪煤矿公司来军政控告，始发觉处理。继而又查出去年贩卖粮棉，今年二月又转卖六十吨火车皮；解放军官团，去年九月在济开办的勤建公司，亦曾有转卖车皮，从事商业活动的行为；据了解徐州警备二旅所领导之生产单位也有破坏政策之说。这些破坏政策与违法行为，应引为鉴戒。我们除已作了严格的自我检讨，请求上级处分，借以教育全党全军，并已组织了工作团到该公司进行彻底检查清理，立即纠正这种破坏政策与违法行为外，特责成各级党委与军政首长，将你们所领导下的生产部门与生产人员，应认真的根据毛主席关于生产建设工作指示的方针：“在人民政府允许下，以农业、畜牧业、渔业、水利事业、手工业，各项建筑工程，各项可能从事的工业，和运输事业为范围，禁止从事商业。”作严格的彻底的检查。在干部思想行为上若是有类似的买空卖空，投机取巧，从事商业，希图暴利，因而破坏政策，违犯法纪的行为，应立即采取有效制止与纠正。各级领导机关必须明确认识，“从长期建设出发，以劳动增加国家和社会财富”的生产方针，并以这一有力的武器，在部队中进行普遍的教育，以期使全党全军，在毛主席伟大的昭示下，坚决贯彻与完成我们这一光荣而又艰巨的生产任务，并立即有效的制止与纠正从事商业的投机行为。为此，特作如下指示：
    （１）各级党委与军政首长，以及各级生产委员会，应认真的学习生产建设工作指示，正确掌握生产政策，明确规定生产任务，审查生产计划，并切实督促检查生产计划的实施，具体了解实施情形，立即采取有效的方法停止商业活动，严格纠正一切破坏政策与违犯法纪的行为。
    （２）各级政治机关，应根据毛主席关于一九五○年部队参加生产建设工作指示，与政务院统一国家财政经济工作的决定，结合你们的实际情况，在部队中进行广泛深入的教育。并着重在生产部门，与生产人员中进行讨论研究，树立正确的生产建设观念，严格纠正和制止在生产建设中，可能产生的偏向。
    （３）经过生产政策教育后，各级党委与军政首长，立即展开民主检查，派出得力工作团或组，必要时首长亲自动手检查所属生产单位，和生产人员中是否有投机取巧，贸易走私，买空卖空，囤积居奇，企图暴利，与民争利等违法行为，及一切类似这样的行为，将此情形进行民主检查，作出决议达到及时有效的制止与纠正。在经过民主检查教育后，胆敢继续违法者，按情节轻重，应给予以应得之处分，以挽回政治影响，教育全军。
    （４）加强全党全军，与一切生产部门和生产人员的思想领导与组织领导，讲清政策，明确方针和任务，提高政治觉悟程度，克服盲目性和只要赚钱不顾影响的糊涂观念，树立政策观念，国家法纪观念，与整体观念。严格奖惩制度，坚决与一切破坏政策违犯法纪的行为，和一切不良倾向作严肃的斗争。
    （５）加强纪律性，严格执行军区所规定的请示报告制度，彻底纠正一切无纪律无政府倾向，和带政策性或较为重大问题不请示不报告的恶劣作风。同时也反对领导上抓得不紧，督促不严，检查不力的官僚主义作风。借以保证不重蹈生建公司之前轨，以期使一九五○年生产任务贯彻完成。
    最后，各级党委与军政首长，希你们接此指示后，立即根据本指示的精神与毛主席生产建设工作的指示，和政务院国家财经统一的决定，结合你们的实际情况，首先由你们进行讨论研究，通过你们在部队机关中，在生产部门与生产人员中，作深入的传达教育，和认真彻底的检查，有效的纠正一切错误行为和不良倾向。特别在生产自给任务将可能更大的情况下，要求你们更加紧密的掌握政策，有预见的警惕可能发生的一切偏向。号召全党全军一致积极努力，纠正缺点，改正错误，克服困难，为彻底完成毛主席所给我们的伟大的生产任务而努力。
