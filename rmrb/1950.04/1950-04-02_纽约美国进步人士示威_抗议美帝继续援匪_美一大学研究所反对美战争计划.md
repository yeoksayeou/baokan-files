Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS, New York, March 31st: Over one hundred American progressives picketed outside the US delegation headquarters to the United Nations, protesting against the continued US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and the bombing of Chinese cities by Chiang Kai-shek's planes obtained from the United States. The picketers carried signs with the slogans: "No aid to Chiang Kai-shek!" "Friendship with China!" "How can you remain silent when Chinese children die under American bombs?" "Stop sending bombs to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!"

The representatives of the demonstrators – Russell, secretary of the "American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy," and Liqui from the Fur Workers Union, left a statement for the officials of the US delegation, strongly protesting against US aid to Chiang Kai-shek.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS, New York, 28th: The announcement by the Institute of Syracuse University in New York State of its refusal to comply with the US government's policy of tying their work to war plans demonstrates the growing resentment of many American scientists towards this policy. A New York Herald Tribune reporter, reporting from Syracuse, stated that Dr. Montonna, director of the Industrial Research Institute of Syracuse University, claimed that the institute was unwilling to accept any secret plans from the US Atomic Energy Commission, because "these plans violate the university's research program aimed at making scientific knowledge generally available."

    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约三月三十一日讯：一百多名美国进步人士在美国驻联合国代表团会址外布设纠察线，抗议美国继续军事援助蒋介石和蒋介石由美国取得的飞机轰炸中国城市。纠察队携带标语牌，上面写着：“不要援助蒋介石！”“对中国友好！”“当中国孩子们在美国炸弹下死去，你们如何能保持缄默？”“停止运炸弹给蒋介石匪帮！”
    示威者的代表——“美国远东民主政策委员会”秘书罗塞尔及毛皮工会的里奎，他们留给美国代表团官员一份声明，强烈抗议美国援助蒋介石。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日电：纽约州西拉卡斯大学研究所宣布拒绝服从美政府将他们的工作束缚于战争计划的政策，这表明美国许多科学家对此一政策日益愤慨的程度。纽约先驱论坛报记者自西拉卡斯报道，西拉卡斯大学工业研究所主任蒙桐纳博士声称：该研究所不愿接受美国原子能委员会任何秘密的计划，因为“这些计划违反该大学使科学知识为一般所有的研究计划的目的。”
