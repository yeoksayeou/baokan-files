　　Recent Situation in Changsha
    Yang Renzhi
    Changsha was peacefully liberated on August 4th of last year. Since liberation, a good revolutionary order has been established, and it is now gradually and steadily moving towards stability and prosperity.

    Market Changes
    Since liberation, market changes have been developing in two different directions. In the past, the large department stores and silk shops around Bajiaoting displayed numerous cosmetics in glass cabinets, but now they only occupy a very small corner, while the dazzling array of floral silks and soft satins has been replaced by locally produced cloth. The production and sales market for necessities is developing rapidly, such as handicrafts like spinning, weaving, sock knitting, as well as coal and rice shops, which are all developing.

    In the eight months since liberation, there have been two major price fluctuations, but speculative merchants have suffered serious blows in these two price fluctuations. Now prices are stable, and people's hearts are also stable.

    Taxes and Public Bonds
    The tax situation is also completely different from the past. In the past, industrialists and businessmen colluded with tax officials to embezzle public funds, with tax revenue going entirely into private pockets. Now, although taxes are not too heavy, once the amount to be paid has been assessed, it cannot be reduced or overdue. As a result, merchants once clamored, claiming that taxes were too heavy, but what is the truth? Taking the profit and income taxes from last winter as an example, based on the minimum market transaction figures at the time, the tax revenue should have been 5.3 billion yuan, while the actual amount levied was only 4 billion yuan, which shows that the people's government's taxes are not heavy. However, the reasonable allocation of burdens is carried out through democratic appraisal, and during this transitional period, some deviations are inevitable. The tax bureau is now working hard to overcome this shortcoming.

    The total number of public bonds allocated to Changsha City was 1.1 million shares. By the end of February, not only was this glorious task completed, but it was also exceeded by more than 50,000 shares. The payment work was also completed at the end of last month and the beginning of this month. In the beginning, some people spread rumors, saying that subscription was impossible and payment would be even more difficult, otherwise, the entire Changsha market would be forced to collapse, and many stores would close down due to purchasing public bonds. But now, the payment task for public bonds has been completed. Not only have stores not closed down due to purchasing public bonds, but on the contrary, the withdrawal of currency due to the purchase of public bonds has made prices more stable.

    Preparatory Work in Rural Areas Before Land Reform
    This autumn, Changsha will implement land reform. Now, preparations are being made to complete this sacred task. A characteristic of rural areas in Changsha is that farmers' land rent deposits are quite heavy. In principle, before land reform, landlords should return this money to the farmers; especially last year when rural areas were damaged by both floods and droughts, and harvests were poor, farmers need this deposit even more to get through the spring famine. As a result, a rent reduction and deposit refund movement has swept through the countryside, and as of March, more than 60 percent has been completed.

　　长沙近况
    杨任之
    长沙是去年八月四日和平解放的。解放以来，已建立起良好的革命秩序，现正渐渐地稳步走向安定与繁荣。
    市场的变化
    解放以后，市场的变化是向着两个不同的方向发展着。在过去八角亭一带的大百货店和绸缎店，玻璃橱内陈列众多的化妆品，现在只占一个极小的角落，而琳琅夺目的花绸软缎，已经以土产的布匹取而代之。必需品的生产与销售市场，日益发展，如手工业纺纱，织布，织袜以及煤炭，米店等都在发展。
    解放八个月以来，曾经有两次物价大波动，但，投机取巧的商人，也在这两次物价的波动中，遭受了严重的打击，现在物价是稳定了，人心也稳定了。
    税收与公债
    税收的情形，也与过去截然不同了，以往是工商业者与税务人员勾结，贪污中饱，税款尽入私囊，现在税收虽不过重，但在评定了应负担的数额后，就不能短少，也不能逾期，于是商人曾一度叫嚣，认为税收太重，但事实究竟是怎样呢？若以去年冬季营利与所得两税而论，在当时以最低限度的市场交易数字估计，应该是纳税五十三亿元，而实际课下来的数字，只有四十亿元，足见人民政府的税收是并不重的。不过，负担的合理分配，是采取民主评议的方法进行，在此过渡期间，还不免有些偏差。现在税局方面正在努力克服这一缺点。
    公债的认购，长沙市分配总数是一百一十万分。在二月底，不但完成了这一光荣任务，且超额五万余份。在上月底本月初亦已完成了缴款工作。开始时曾有人造谣，说什么认购既不可能，缴款更难完成任务，否则，必定要迫使整个长沙市场的崩溃，很多商店会因购买公债而要倒闭。而现在，公债已经完成缴款任务了，不但商店没有因购买公债而倒闭，反之，因购买公债，货币回笼使物价更趋稳定了。
    土改前农村的准备工作
    今年秋后，长沙将要实行土地改革，现在，已开始为完成这一神圣任务而做准备工作。长沙农村的特点，农民佃地押金是相当沉重的。按理在土地改革前，地主应把收受的这笔钱，退回农民；尤其是去年农村为水旱两灾所侵害，年成歉收，农民更需要这笔押金，用以渡过春荒，于是农村卷起了减租退押运动，截至三月份止，已完成了百分之六十以上。
