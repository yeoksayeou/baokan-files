How to Clean Up Warehouses
    Wang Wenxiang
    The measures regarding the establishment of a National Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee, the inventory of warehouse materials, and the unified allocation and rational use under the Central Financial and Economic Commission are aimed at opposing waste, promoting streamlining, utilizing stagnant materials, and increasing urgently needed equipment. This not only opens a new page in the history of warehouse management in our country, but also a landmark innovation in the entire financial aspect of our country.
    In managing warehouses, regardless of the system, the basic equipment must include material tags, account books, monthly statements (balance sheets), and annual reports. Account registration is roughly divided into several items such as: category, number, product name, specification, unit, quantity, unit price, and total value. Those with excellent management performance will surely have consistency between existing goods and registration, and clear names and specifications. Those with slightly poorer performance often have accounts without goods, goods without accounts, names that do not match the actual goods, actual goods that do not match the material tags, material tags that do not match the account books, and account books that do not match the monthly statements. In addition, regarding receiving, dispatching, registration, reporting, and statistical work, some classification and numbering have not yet been unified, and items such as product name, specifications, units, and unit prices are incomplete or inconsistent. Such shortcomings have been largely unavoidable for previous warehouse management departments.
    Since liberation, warehouses in various regions have been taken over separately, and most of the materials and equipment are yet to be cleared and utilized. In order to save government financial expenditures and make the best use of materials, the government has established a National Warehouse Material and Equipment Clearing and Allocation Committee to handle the clearing and allocation of all materials and equipment, so that idle goods can be revitalized and frozen funds can be unfrozen. In order to smoothly realize this work, the following suggestions are provided for cleaning up warehouses:
    I. Organization
    Regarding the leading institutions for clearing and allocation, in addition to the National Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee and its branches, which have been officially announced by the government, all departments with stored materials and equipment may establish warehouse clearing and allocation sub-committees, with the minister or deputy minister concurrently serving as director, and the head of the materials department concurrently serving as deputy director. Bureaus or units equivalent to bureaus may establish branches when necessary, with the bureau chief or deputy bureau chief concurrently serving as director. A clearing team should be established under the branch, with the head of the warehouse or materials plant serving as the team leader, and the warehouse keeper, material account registrar, the head of the unit's trade union, and more progressive workers as team members, responsible for carrying out inventory, sorting, reporting, and compilation under the unified leadership of the national headquarters.
    The cadres selected by each unit to participate in the work must have the following qualifications:
    (1) Inventory personnel must:
    (1) Be familiar with materials and equipment, and have in-depth knowledge of the categories, names, specifications, and units of materials and equipment;
    (2) Be clear about the procedures for receiving and dispatching materials and equipment, the registration of account books, and the relationship between various documents and reports;
    (3) Be full of working spirit, not avoiding dust and dirt, and be serious and thorough in handling affairs;
    (4) Be ideologically progressive, loyal and responsible, and will not underreport or overreport problems found, or exaggerate the truth, or cover up the matter.
    (2) Reporting personnel - both grassroots reporting personnel and intermediate review and compilation reporting personnel should be familiar with the categories, names, specifications, units, etc. of materials and equipment. In this way, in the process of review and compilation, the inconsistencies can be unified and the incompleteness can be supplemented. In the future, the central unified leading organs will be able to reduce doubts and make quick decisions when implementing rational allocation work.
    (3) Allocation personnel, in addition to being more familiar with the categories, names, specifications, units, and values of materials and equipment, must also understand their quality, performance, uses, dosages, land use, time of use, and the relationship between material A and material B, and the effects of material C combined with material D. With this set of skills, tens of thousands of kinds of materials and equipment can be allocated reasonably and appropriately.
    II. Inventory
    There are generally two ways to inventory warehouses: one is "closed-door" inventory, and the other is continuous inventory. Closed-door inventory means stopping receiving and dispatching work and specializing in inventorying stock. This method is simple and progresses quickly, but for warehouses with too much stock or frequent receiving and dispatching work, the inventory time may be too long, which may hinder the supply of materials. Continuous inventory is to inventory stock outside of daily work. This method can balance both receiving and dispatching and inventory work, so as not to delay the dispatch of materials and affect the progress of daily work. However, in larger-scale warehouses or warehouses with heavy receiving and dispatching work, the date required for inventory will be prolonged. In addition, inventorying warehouse stock is divided into two types: fixed-term and current-term. For fixed-term inventory, regardless of the length of the inventory date, the stock quantity on a specified date is taken as the standard. Subsequent receipts and issues are added or subtracted respectively to obtain the stock quantity that should be available, and then reconciled and reported. This method is suitable for warehouses with monthly account books. For current-term inventory, the inventory of goods is carried out every day, and the stock quantity on that day is taken as the standard, and immediately checked against the balance figure of the account book on the same day. This method is suitable for warehouses with daily account books. This time, the government is cleaning up warehouses across the country. In order to complete the task on schedule and take into account the convenience of compiling, reviewing, and checking inventory reports and allocating inventory goods, it seems appropriate to adopt a blitz-style "closed-door" inventory and report on a regular basis.
    Before the warehouse inventory work begins, the following preparatory work should be done well:
    (1) Materials and equipment in boxes, barrels, packages, boxes, baskets, or individual units should be arranged neatly in their original storage locations, vertically and horizontally, and as far as possible in whole numbers of rows, to facilitate the inventory of stock.
    (2) If the same type of equipment is stored in different locations, it should be merged into one place as far as possible, or noted on the material tag.
    (3) If the material tag and the actual goods are stored in different locations, they should be hung in the location where the actual goods are stored first.
    (4) For bulky steel equipment that is stored outside and it is not convenient to hang paper material tags, a wooden nameplate of about three inches square or a material nameplate cut from scrap iron should be hung first.
    (5) Most scales that have been used for many years are not very flexible and reliable. Old tape measures (commonly known as tape measures) whose paint has been partially peeled off may be shortened by half a foot for every 100 feet in length. Therefore, before inventorying stock, this type of tool must first be tested for accuracy. Otherwise, the quantity of the measured equipment will cause disputes when it is transferred to other agencies in the future.
    (6) The application form formats should be prepared in advance, and the format size and binding method should each have a standard to ensure consistency.
    During actual work, each clearing team should be composed of one person in charge of materials, one person in charge of accounts, and one more progressive employee, for a total of three people. Two of them personally weigh, measure, and count, and one person (the team leader) fills in the existing quantity and profit and loss quantity in the material tag, material account, and inventory report, respectively. As for temporary porters, they can be temporarily transferred from the stock-holding agency, and if necessary, a blitz method can be used to mobilize all employees to participate in the work.
    When inventorying stock, materials packed in boxes, barrels, packages, boxes, etc., except those that can prove that the contents have not changed, should be inspected by sampling to prevent shortages, or the use of objects to impersonate, or the use of empty skins to replace.
    If quantity gains or losses, or quality deterioration, such as paint, medicines, clothing, fabrics, etc., are found during inventory, they should be noted in the stock tag, account book, and inventory report form, respectively.
    After each type of stock is inventoried, the team leader and the employee in charge of the stock and account book should jointly sign or affix a seal after the closing figure on the material tag and account book to indicate responsibility.
    III. Sorting
    After each warehouse has completed its inventory, the names, specifications, units, etc. of the existing goods should be sorted first to make them clear and unified. Then begin to compile the official inventory report. For example: regarding the name, kerosene, there are distinctions between "kerosene", "paraffin oil", "lamp oil", and "foreign oil". Regarding specifications, in terms of size alone, some use the imperial system, some use the metric system, and some use a mixture of the two systems. There are even more patterns in terms of units. Taking oil as an example, some use "large barrels", some use "small barrels", some use "pounds", and some use "kilograms", and some even use English transliterations, with "barrel" using "tin" and "liter" using "liter". These diverse and complex situations must be sorted on the spot before compiling the inventory report to make them unified, so as to avoid the report being sent to various levels of leadership agencies and carrying out compilation and allocation work, or converting and merging them by themselves, or inquiring through letters and telegrams, delaying time and wasting manpower, which would not only affect the progress of the work, but also the results of the warehouse inventory may be difficult to be thorough. Regarding more specific methods for unifying names, specifications, units, etc., the following suggestions are made:
    (1) "Names" should be standardized as much as possible. Those that do not yet have standards should use those that are generally easy to understand. Common names and local names should be noted in the notes column of the report and account book.
    (2) The "specifications" item should be as detailed as possible. Those whose dimensions are still described in the imperial system should each be annotated with the metric system.
    (3) All "units" that use containers as units, such as boxes, bottles, barrels, etc., should indicate the weight or number of contents. All units that use feet, pounds, gallons, etc. should be converted to the metric system, namely meters, kilograms, and liters.
    The result of sorting out the data can clarify the actual situation of the existing equipment, and further determine the stock that should be retained. This first requires considering the stock standard and the standard stock. "Standard stock" is all kinds of materials that must be stocked regularly and issued at any time. This standard should be stipulated by the material supply department in consultation with the material using departments. "Stock standard" is the standard for the quantity of various standard stocks that should be stocked. This standard should be stipulated by the material supply department based on the annual material usage budget of the standard stock compiled by each material using department and the length of time required for procurement. For example: a certain material requires 120 tons per year, and it takes a total of three months from the time of purchase requisition to the time it is delivered to the warehouse. In addition, in order to ensure the completion of the supply task, an additional safety factor of one month's usage is added. Then the standard stock (or "minimum stock") of this material should be the average usage of four months, totaling 40 tons. Whenever the stock quantity is reduced to this number, or close to this number, a request should be made to purchase replenishment to avoid the depletion of inventory and affect the supply.
    In addition, regarding the inventory report, the on-site material and equipment inventory report should be filled out by each stock-holding unit. The bureau-level should be filled out by the material management department or the branch based on the on-site inventory reports of each unit. The branch inventory report should be filled out based on the reports of each branch and sent to the national headquarters for verification.
    The formal on-site material inventory report should be filled out after the material name, specifications, units, etc. have been sorted out. When the branch compiles the inventory reports sent by each unit under its jurisdiction, it should make a second step of correction and unification of the material name, specifications, units, etc. When the sub-committee compiles the inventory reports of the sub-committees under its jurisdiction, it should make the third correction and unification. After the national headquarters receives the report after such step-by-step correction and unification, there will not be many questions about the execution of review, allocation, and other work.
    IV. Allocation and Storage
    After the national headquarters receives the inventory reports sent by various departments and regions, it should immediately allocate the equipment that can be allocated to each agency for application according to the approved material usage budget. When the national headquarters allocates materials to various departments and their leading agencies, it should issue allocation notices.
    At the end of each month, each agency should handle the transfer procedures for the equipment distributed in the whole month. All materials and equipment handed over to the warehouses established or designated by the national headquarters, or temporarily kept or distributed to other agencies on behalf of the national headquarters, should be filled in with transfer orders by the issuing warehouse, and sent to the branch for review and signature, and then transferred to the national headquarters for approval. Similarly, the national headquarters must also fill out transfer orders for the materials and equipment distributed to each receiving department according to the allocation orders and incoming transfer orders, and deliver them directly or through the intermediate agency to the material receiving units for verification and signature.
    Regarding the storage and sorting of materials, the government has already stipulated that all materials and equipment that cannot be processed or utilized this year should be classified separately, appropriate warehouses should be established, and the national headquarters should be in charge of them uniformly, or designated a certain department or region to manage them on their behalf, and a strict warehouse management system should be established. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the national headquarters, two departments, a military system warehouse and a non-military system warehouse, should be set up separately to handle the inventory, collection, allocation, and sorting of materials and equipment.

　　怎样清理仓库
    王文翔
    关于成立全国仓库物资清理调配委员会及清查仓库物资，报由中央财政经济委员会统一调配合理使用等项的措施，其目的是在反对浪费，提倡精简，利用呆滞物资，增加急需器材。这不仅是在我国仓库管理史上开了新的一页，在我国整个财政方面，也是一件划时代的革新工作。
    管理仓库，制度不同，其基本设备，必须有料牌，有帐册，有月结清单（平衡表），有年度报告。帐内登记，约分：类别、编号、品名、规格、单位、数量、单价、总值等若干项。管理成绩优良的，自必现品与登记一致，名称与规格详明，成绩稍差的，往往有的有帐无货，有的有货无帐，有的名称与实物不符，有的实物与料牌不符，有的料牌与帐册不符，有的帐册与月结不符。此外关于收发、登记、造报、统计等项工作，有的分类编号尚未统一，品名、规格、单位、单价等项未能完备或不一致。种种缺陷，殆为以往仓库管理部门所未能完全避免。
    解放以后，各地仓库分别接管，物资器材多数尚待清理利用，政府为了节省财政支出，物尽其用，成立了全国仓库物资器材清理调配委员会，办理一切物资器材的清理调配，使死藏货品翻身，冻结资金融解。为了使这一工作顺利实现，兹提供清理仓库意见如次：
    一、组织
    关于清理调配的领导机构，除全国仓库物资清理调配委员会及分会等，曾经政府明令公布外，凡存有物资器材的各部，得成立仓库清理调配分会，以部长或副部长兼主任，材料部门负责人兼副主任，各局或相当于局的单位必要时得成立支会，以局长或副局长兼主任，支会下成立清理小组，以仓库或材料厂库首长为组长，本管仓库保管员，料帐登记员，本单位职工会负责人及职工中比较前进的分子等为组员，分会在全国总会统一领导下，负责领导所属各支会，支会负责领导所属各清理小组，进行清查、整理、造报、以及汇编等事宜。
    各单位所选派参加工作的干部必须具有下列条件：
    （一）点查人员必须：
    （１）认识物资器材，并对物资器材的类别，名称，规格，单位等有深切的研究；
    （２）对收发物资器材的手续，帐册的登记，和各种单据表报相互间的关系等均须明了；
    （３）富有劳动精神，不避灰土尘垢，办事认真彻底；
    （４）思想进步，忠实负责，不致在查出问题后，或以轻报重，或以重报轻，或言过其实，或隐瞒了事。
    （二）造报人员——基层造报人员和各个中间审核汇编报告人员，都应当熟悉物资器材的类别，名称，规格，单位等等。这样在审核汇编的工作过程中，才能将不统一的地方，统一起来，不完备的地方，充实起来。以后中央统一领导机关对于执行合理的调配工作时，才能减少疑问，迅速决定。
    （三）调配人员，除了应该更多的熟悉物资器材的类别，名称，规格，单位及价值等项外，还须要了解它们的品质，性能，用途，用量，用地，用时，及甲料和乙料的关系，丙料合丁料所发生的作用等。有了这一套技能，才能把数万种物资器材调配得合理得当。
    二、点查
    清查仓库，一般的有两种办法：一种是“闭门”清点，一种是陆续清点。闭门清点就是停止收发工作，专事盘点存货，这种办法，工作单纯，进步迅速，不过对存货过多或收发工作频繁的仓库，就恐点查时间长久，妨碍了用料供应。陆续点查，就是在日常工作以外进行盘点存货。这种办法，对于收发点查两项工作，可以兼顾，不致延误发料，而影响日常工作的进行。但是在较大规模或收发工作繁重的仓库，那清点所需要的日期就会拖长。此外清查仓库存货，又分定期与活期两种。定期的，无论盘点日期长短先后，均按规定的某一日期的存量为标准，期后收发，分别加减，求出应存数量，然后根据对帐，并编造报告。这种办法于设有月结帐册的仓库适用之。活期者，每日盘点货品，概以当日的存量为标准，并即与同日帐册之结存数字相核对。这种办法于设有日记帐册的仓库适用之。此次政府清理全国仓库，为了如期完成任务并照顾到编审点查报告和调配库存货品等的便利起见，似以采用突击式的“闭门”清点，并定期造报的办法为宜。
    在清查仓库工作开始以前，应搞好了下列的准备工作：
    （一）凡以箱、桶、包、盒、罗、个等为单位的器材，应各在原存地点，按纵横高先行排列整齐，并尽量以整数成行，以便点查存数。
    （二）同种器材异地存放者，应尽量先行归并到一处，或者在料牌内注明之。
    （三）料牌与现品分地存放者，应先悬挂在现品存放的地点。
    （四）笨重钢铁器材，凡在库外存放，而不便悬挂纸制料牌者，应先悬挂方约三寸的木制名牌或以废铁片剪制的料名牌。
    （五）使用年久的磅秤，多半不甚灵活可靠。用旧而漆皮业经局部脱落的带尺（俗称皮尺），每长一百英尺有缩短半英尺的可能。因此在清查存货以前，这一类工具，首先要把它们考验准确。不然量过的器材，将来调拨到别的机关的时候，数量上会要发生纠葛的。
    （六）应用的表报格式，都要事前准备齐全，格式尺寸大小及装订方法等也应当各有标准，以资一致。
    进行实际工作时，每一清理小组，应由管料管帐及比较前进的职工各一人共三人组成之。其中以二人亲自过磅、量尺、点数，一人（小组长）分别在料牌，料帐，及点查报告内填写现存数量，及盈亏数量。至于临时搬运工人，可由存货机关暂行抽调，必要时并用突击方式，发动全体员工，共同参加工作。
    在进行点查工作中，凡以箱、桶、包、盒等装盛的材料，除能证明内容确无变动者外，其余均须用抽查办法检验之，以防范有缺额者，或以物冒充，或用空皮顶替。
    点查存货时如发现有数量盈亏，质地败坏者，如油漆、药品、服装、织品等，应分别在存料牌、帐册、和点查报告单内注明之。
    每点查一种存货后，小组组长及主管该种存货与帐册的员工，应共同在料牌及帐册之结存数字后，签名或盖章，表示负责。
    三、整理
    每一仓库在点查完毕后，对现品的名称、规格、单位等项应先加以整理，使之明确化，统一化。然后再行开始编造正式点查报告。例如：关于名称，火油一项，就有“火油”“煤油”“灯油”“洋油”之分。关于规格，仅尺寸一项，则有用英制的，有用公制的，也有两种制度参杂使用的。关于单位则花样更多，即就油料一类来说，有用“大桶”的，有用“小桶”的，有用“磅”的，有用“公斤”的，更有采用英文译音而“桶”用“听”（tin），“公升”用“立”（liter）的，这些纷歧复杂的情况，必须在现场方面于编造点查报告以前，加以整理，使之统一，以免以后报告送到各层领导机关而执行汇编和调配工作的时候，或自行折合归并，或往来函电查询，延误时间，浪费人力，那就不仅是影响工作的推进，而且清查仓库的结果，恐怕就很难彻底了。关于统一名称，规格，单位等比较具体一些的办法，兹建议如下：
    （一）“名称”应尽量采用标准者，其尚无标准者，则用一般容易了解者，俗名，土称，应各在报告与帐册的附注栏内注明之。
    （二）“规格”一项，务求详尽，其尺寸说明仍用英制者，应各附注公制。
    （三）“单位”凡以容器为单位者，如盒、瓶、桶等应说明内容重量或个数。凡以英尺、磅、加仑等为单位者，一律改用公制，即公尺、公斤、公升。
    整理资料的结果，就可以明了现存器材的实际状况，进一步便须核定应该保有的存量，这首先要考虑到存料标准与标准存料。“标准存料”就是经常必须存备随时发用的各种材料，这种标准应由材料供应部门商同各用料部门规定之。“存料标准”就是各种标准存料应存数量的标准，这种标准，应由材料供应部门根据各用料部门编造的标准存料年度用料预算，及采购所需要的时间长短而规定。例如：某种材料全年需要一百廿吨，而采购这种材料由请购之时起，至交到仓库之时止，共需三个月的时间，此外为了保证完成供应任务，再酌加安全系数一个月的用量，那末这种材料的标准存量（或“最低存量”），就应该是四个月的平均用量，计四十吨。存料数量每降低到这个数字，或相近这个数字的时候，那就应该请求购买补充，以免库存竭蹶影响供应了。
    此外，关于点查报告方面，现场物资器材点查报告由每一存料单位填写，局级由材料主管部门或支会根据各现场点查报告核填，分会点查报告应根据各支会的报告填写，送全国总会核办。
    正式现场材料点查报告，应于材料名称、规格、单位等项整理完毕后填写。支会汇编所属各单位造送之点查报告时，对于材料名称、规格、单位等项应做第二步的修正及统一工作。分会汇编所属各支会点查报告时，做第三次的修正及统一工作。这样逐级修正统一，在全国总会收到报告之后，对于执行审查调配等项工作，就不致再有许多疑问了。
    四、调配及保管
    全国总会收到各部区等造送的清查报告后，应即将可能调拨的器材，根据批准用料预算分配各机关应用。总会向各部及其领导机关调拨材料时，应填发调拨通知单。
    各机关每至月底，应各将全月配发器材，分别办理转帐手续，凡属交总会自设或指定的仓库，或受总会委托暂代保管，或代发给其他机关的物资器材，均应由发料仓库填具转账单，送经支会审核签章后，转送全国总会签认。全国总会同样的也要把配给与各收用部门的物资器材，根据调拨单及收入转帐单填开转帐单，直接或经中转机关交由收用器材单位核对签认。
    关于材料的保管整理，政府已有规定，即凡今年不能处理或利用之物资器材，一律分别种类，建立适当仓库，由全国总会统一掌管，或指定某部门某地区代管，并建立严密的仓库管理制度，同时在全国总会的统一领导下，分设军事系统仓库，与非军事系统仓库两部门，分别办理物资器材的清查、搜集、调配、整理等事宜。
