　　Moats of the Former Three City Gates
    Dredging Project Completed
    Residents Along the River Should Pay Attention to Cleanliness to Avoid Re-Siltation
    [News from Beijing Municipal News Agency] The dredging project of the moats of the former three city gates in Beijing was fully completed on the 31st of last month. The river enters the city from the Xibianmen water gate, passes Xuanwumen, Qianmen, and Chongwenmen, and exits the Dongbianmen water gate into the Tonghui River, with a total length of approximately 7,662 meters. The project was carried out in two sections, east and west. The east section started on March 1st and was completed on the 10th; the west section started on March 11th and was completed on the 31st. This project accounts for approximately one-eighth of the total length of river and lake dredging planned by the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau this year. A total of approximately 18,366 cubic meters of mud was dredged and has been transported by farmers to the suburbs for use as fertilizer.
    The main reasons for the siltation of the moats of the former three city gates are, on the one hand, that there are more than 170 sewer outlets in the river, and on the other hand, residents along the river often dump garbage and sewage into the river. After this dredging, in order to avoid re-siltation of the river, the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau will work with the Public Security Bureau police station to pay attention to the cleanliness work along the river, prohibit the dumping of garbage, and build sixteen sewage ponds along the river for nearby residents to dump sewage.

　　前三门护城河
    疏浚工程全部完工
    沿河居民应注意保洁以免再度淤塞
    【京市新闻处讯】京市前三门护城河的疏浚工程已于上月三十一日全部完工。该河由系西便门水关进城沿宣武门、前门、崇文门出东便门水关入通惠河，总长约七千六百六十二公尺。工程进行分东西两段，东段三月一日开工，十日完工；西段三月十一日开工，三十一日完工。这一工程约占京市卫生工程局今年疏浚河湖计划总长的八分之一。共掏泥约一万八千三百六十六公方，已由农民运往郊区充作肥料。
    前三门护城河淤塞的主要原因，一方面是由于河道中有一百七十多个下水道的出水口，另方面是沿河居民常向河内倾倒垃圾及秽水所致。此次疏浚后，京市卫生工程局为避免河道的再度淤塞，将会同公安局派出所注意沿河保洁工作，禁止倾倒垃圾，并在沿河修建十六个秽水池，专供附近居民倾倒秽水用。
