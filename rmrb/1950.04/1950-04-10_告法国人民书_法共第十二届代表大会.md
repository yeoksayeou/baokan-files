　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 7th (TASS): The 12th Congress of the French Communist Party unanimously adopted the "Appeal to the People of France," the full text of which is as follows:

French men and women!

　　　　War threatens the world
　　American imperialists, tightly gripped by the poison of crisis, are preparing for war with fanatical haste. They have greatly increased their military budgets. They are once again accelerating the arming of Marshallized nations, including reactionary, militaristic, and revanchist West Germany.
　　According to their own shameless revelations, in order to forcibly rule and enslave the world, they intend to use their atomic and hydrogen bombs to kill children in their infancy, elderly praying people, and working people.
　　The French Communist Party—the great party of the working class, the party of national independence and peace—calls on you to unite in action to eliminate the terrible disaster of atomic war, save France, and defend peace.

　　　　The government betrays the interests of the motherland
　　American imperialists want to turn France into a source of cannon fodder, turning the French into infantry destined for destruction, infantry that will be commanded by the butchers of Oradour-sur-Glane residents. The government, however, kowtows to these imperialists, abandons the defense of national independence, and agrees to the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Military Assistance Program, and its policies. These imperialists have begun to send weapons, ammunition, aircraft, artillery, and tanks to our ports, intending to turn France into a battlefield for the use of atomic bombs, a battlefield of devastation and destruction. The imperialists want to launch a war against socialist countries; the imperialists want to launch a war against the Soviet Union—a socialist country that, under the leadership of Stalin, saved the world from fascist barbarism and relentlessly pursues a policy of peace. The imperialists want to launch a war against the People's Democracies, which are advancing on the road to socialism. The imperialists want to launch a war against the international workers' and democratic movement striving to free themselves from the tyranny of oppressors and become masters of their own destiny.

　　　　Despicable rulers lead France to a dead end
　　France is being devastated by those despicable rulers who, under foreign directives, are pursuing this policy of poverty, reaction, and war. They are worsening the living conditions of the working masses. They are plundering the peasants, leading the middle class to ruin; at the same time, they are shamefully increasing the excessive profits of the capitalists.
　　Poverty is growing, and unemployment is increasing. The rights to democratic freedoms, trade unions, strikes, assembly, and demonstrations are being systematically undermined. Active workers, democrats, participants in the resistance movement, and peace fighters are suffering illegal persecution. They are imprisoned, and their civil rights are deprived. Conversely, traitors who collaborated with the enemy have been released. Those who bribe and are bribed go unpunished.
　　These rulers are attempting to implement a fascist dictatorship. This shameful gang, made up of members of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, the traitors of the Gaullist Party, the Radical Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Liberal Republican Party, is trying to preserve this blood-stained regime, a demagogic regime, a police dictatorship.
　　The parties of this gang have adopted despicable laws. They are preparing an election law that deprives one-third of the French people of representation in the National Assembly. At the same time, the government is colluding with De Gaulle, leading France to fascism. They are driving our sons to shed blood in the criminal war in Vietnam—a war fought for the benefit of the Banque de l'Indochine, and to establish strategic bases for American war-mongers!
　　Enough blood has been shed, enough destruction has been done, and enough have died!
　　The people do not want the filthy war in Vietnam; the people do not want the war of aggression that is now being prepared; the people will not go to war. The people want peace. To fight for peace is to fight for France, for freedom, for the restoration of national independence, and for the happiness of the men and women of France.

　　　　Peace is in imminent danger
　　The 12th Congress of the French Communist Party calls on all upright people to take action to defend peace. The peoples of all nations have understood the seriousness of the danger. Therefore, they are actively fighting against war, as evidenced by the courageous and patriotic struggles of dockworkers, sailors, and railway workers. The entire working people support them with action, and the masses of the people give them effective support. Men and women refuse to unload, transport, and produce the sinful munitions that will bring us enslavement and death, loyal to the traditions of the working class, loyal to the glorious struggle of our people for freedom and national independence.

　　　　Unite to fight for peace
French men and women!
　　Communists, Socialists, Catholics, Republicans, men and women, young and old, workers and peasants, manual and mental laborers, patriots of all political beliefs, philosophical schools, and religious faiths! Rise up together and build a united front for peace. In every place—in every enterprise, in every city, in every village, and in every residential area—establish peace committees, and in every place, elect local branches of the "Fighters for Freedom and Peace" association.

　　　　Ban atomic weapons
French men and women!
　　The Stockholm Conference of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace issued an inspiring and motivating call, calling on you to sign petitions, striving to complete the banning of atomic weapons—weapons of aggression and mass slaughter, striving to establish strict international control to ensure the implementation of the ban, and striving to declare the government that first uses this weapon of intimidation as illegal, as a war criminal.
　　The great struggle of all nations to defend peace will expand. Millions of signatures will confirm the unwavering will of the French people for peace.

　　　DepartTimely to establish a government to save the motherland
　　The 12th Congress of the French Communist Party is convinced that this expresses your feelings—the Congress specifically reminds the adventurers: "The French people will never fight against the Soviet Union," the Soviet Union is the country of the victors of Stalingrad.
　　French men and women! Unite immediately to stop the dirty war in Vietnam, recall the expeditionary force, and implement our program to save the motherland!
　　Unite to establish the government you hope our country will have—an honest government, a government of freedom and peace, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, a government of democratic unity, a true French government.
　　The French Communist Party, faithful to its heroes and martyrs of the Resistance, is determined, together with all good people, to lead France to a bright future, to happiness and peace. The advantage is on the side of the forces of peace and democracy, and as long as they unite and take action, they can force the warmongers to retreat, and victory will belong to them.
　　Long live the French Communist Party!
　　Long live free, democratic, and independent France!
　　Long live communism!
　　Long live peace!

　　　　　　　　　　The 12th National Congress of the French Communist Party (signed)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　April 6, 1950

　　告法国人民书
    法共第十二届代表大会
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：法国共产党第十二届代表大会一致通过告法国人民书，全文如下：法国男女们！
            战争在威胁着全世界
    被危机的毒害紧紧扼住的美帝国主义者，正以狂热的匆促准备着战争。他们大大地增加了他们的军事预算。他们再度加速地武装马歇尔化了的国家，其中包括反动的、军国主义的、复仇主义的西德。
    根据他们自己的无耻表露，为了强行统治和奴役全世界，他们打算用他们的原子弹和氢弹，杀死尚在襁褓时期的孩子、年老的祈祷者和正在工作的人们。
    法国共产党——工人阶级的伟大政党，国家独立与和平的政党，号召你们团结行动，以消除原子战争的可怕灾祸，拯救法国，保卫和平。
            政府出卖祖国的利益
    美帝国主义者要把法国变为炮灰的泉源，把法国人变成命定要毁灭的步兵，这支步兵将由奥拉多·索尔·格兰德居民的屠杀者来指挥。而政府却对这些帝国主义者奴颜婢膝，抛弃了对国家独立的保卫，同意了马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约、军事援助计划及其政策。这些帝国主义者已开始把武器、弹药、飞机、大炮和坦克送到我们的港口，这些东西的用意，就是把法国变为使用原子弹的战场，变为受蹂躏、遭毁灭的战场。帝国主义者要想进攻社会主义的国家，帝国主义者要想发动战争，进攻苏联——社会主义的国家，在斯大林领导下把世界从法西斯野蛮主义下拯救了出来，并不懈地推行和平政策的国家。帝国主义者想对人民民主国家发动战争，这些国家正在社会主义的道路上迈进。帝国主义者想对力争解脱压迫者的暴政而成为自己命运的主宰者的国际工人运动与民主运动发动战争。
            卑鄙的统治者把法国带上了绝路
    法国正在被那些听从外国的指使，进行这种贫困、反动和战争政策的卑鄙统治者们摧残着。他们使劳动大众的生活情况更趋恶劣。他们掠夺了农民，使中等阶级趋于毁灭；同时，却使资本家们的超额利润可耻地提高。
    贫困在增长，失业在加多。民主自由的权利，工会的权利，罢工的权利，集会和示威的权利，在受着有计划的破坏。积极的工人，民主人士，参加抵抗运动的人士，和平战士们，遭受着非法的迫害。他们被囚禁，他们的公民权利被剥夺。相反的，曾经与敌人合作的卖国贼们，反而得到了释放。行贿的和受贿的，逍遥法外。
    这些统治者，企图实行法西斯独裁。有社会党右翼首领们，戴高乐党叛徒们，激进党，人民共和党，自由共和党等党的党员们参加的这可耻的一帮，试图保存这一个满染血污的政权，愚民主义的政权，警察独裁的政权。
    这一帮的各党派，采纳了卑鄙的法律。他们正在准备着一项使三分之一的法国人在国民议会中没有代表的选举法，同时，政府正在与戴高乐狼狈为奸，把法国引向法西斯主义。他们驱使我们的儿子们，到罪恶的越南战争中去流血——这样一个战争，为了汇理银行的利益，为了要给美国战争贩子建立战略基地而打的战争！
    血流得够了，破坏也破坏得够了，死也死得够了！
    人民不要污秽的越南战争，人民不要现在正在筹备中的侵略战争，人民不去作战。人民要的是和平。为和平而奋斗，就是为法国，为自由，为恢复国家独立，为法国男女人民的幸福而奋斗。
            和平受着千钧一发的危险
    法国共产党第十二届代表大会号召一切正直的人民为保卫和平采取行动。全世界各族人民，都已经理解到了危险的严重性。因此，他们积极地为反对战争而斗争，这由码头工人、海员和铁路工人的勇敢的、爱国的斗争可以证明，全体劳动人民都以行动支持他们，人民群众都给他们以有效的支援。劳动男女拒绝起卸、运输和生产将给我们带来奴役和死亡的罪恶的军火，忠于工人阶级的传统，忠于我国人民为自由和国家独立的光荣的斗争。
            团结起来进行和平斗争法国男女们！
    共产党人，社会党人，天主教徒，共和分子，男子和妇女，青年和老人，工人和农民，体力劳动者和脑力劳动者，一切政治信仰、哲学派别和宗教信仰的爱国者！一同起来，建立和平的统一阵线。在一切地方——在每一个企业里，在每一个城市中，在每一个乡村和每一个居民区，成立和平委员会，在每一个地方，选举出当地的“争自由和平战士”协会分会。
            禁止原子武器法国男女们！
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议发出了令人鼓舞奋发的号召，号召你们签署请愿书，力争完成禁止原子武器——侵略和大批屠杀的武器，力争建立严格的国际管制以确保禁令的实施，力争宣布首先使用这一恫吓武器的政府为非法、为战争罪犯。
    所有各族人民保卫和平的伟大斗争，规模将愈形扩大。千百万的签名将证实法国人民坚定不移的和平意志。
            建立拯救祖国的政府
    法国共产党第十二届代表大会深信这表达了你们的感情——大会特提醒冒险主义者：“法国人民决不对苏联作战”，苏联是斯大林格勒的胜利者的国家。
    法国男女们！团结起来立即制止越南的肮脏战争，召回远征军，实行我们的拯救祖国的纲领！
    团结起来建立你们希望我国具有的政府——正直的政府，自由与和平的政府，民有、民治、民享的政府，民主团结的政府，真正的法国政府。
    法国共产党忠实于它的抵抗运动的英雄和烈士，决心与一切善良的人民一起，把法国引向光辉灿烂的将来，引向幸福与和平。优势是在和平民主力量方面的，只要他们团结并采取行动，就能够迫使战争贩子后退，胜利将属于他们。
    法国共产党万岁！
    自由、民主、独立的法兰西万岁！
    共产主义万岁！
    和平万岁！
                    法国共产党第十二届全国代表大会（签字）
                                            一九五○年四月六日
