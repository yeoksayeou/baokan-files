　　Organize to Overcome Difficulties of Disaster and Famine
    Shandong Spring Plowing Basically Completed
    [Our Newspaper's News] According to the Shandong Dazhong Daily: Shandong Province's spring plowing has been basically completed amidst the struggle against severe disaster and famine, and has generally shifted to spring sowing. According to understanding around April 7th, in the Lu Zhongnan Region, spring land has been plowed on average up to 90 percent. Except for a small number of areas, land for large seedlings has been completely plowed and generally sown. In the Jiaodong Region, farmers generally completed spring plowing around the Qingming Festival. For example, in the Binbei Special District, by the end of March, except for Cangma, all other counties had plowed over 90 percent. Most of the Xihai Special District and Pingdong and Pingxi in the Nanhai Special District, as well as Qidong and Qixi in the southern part of the Beihai Special District, have successively basically completed plowing. Some areas have already sown seeds. In Chagnan County, Xihai Special District, millet was planted by the end of March. In the eastern part of Rongcheng, Donghai Special District, in order to plant crops early and go to sea to fish, many households have already planted corn. In the Bohai Region, because more land was winter-plowed last year (up to 80 percent), this reduced many difficulties for this year's spring plowing, which has now been basically completed.

    This year's spring plowing was carried out under severe disaster and famine conditions. Leading organs in various localities have all taken production and disaster relief as the central task overriding everything else, and transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen leadership, generally gradually grasping the combination of spring plowing and disaster relief. Various localities emphasized implementing organization, carrying out spring plowing and sideline production through labor exchange groups, which not only did not delay spring plowing but also provided disaster relief. However, some areas had deviations in leadership, and spring plowing progressed slowly. For example, in most counties in the Nishan Special District of the Lu Zhongnan Region and the four counties in Huxi of the Taizao Special District, cadres held the idea that "the disaster situation is serious, we will be responsible if people starve to death, it doesn't matter if spring plowing is a little late," and thus neglected spring plowing leadership, resulting in slow progress. In the four counties of Huxi in the Taizao Special District, only 60 percent has been plowed to date, and in Jibei County in the Nishan Special District, less than half had been plowed by the beginning of this month. In disaster-light areas such as the Taishan and Yimeng Special Districts, due to the leadership's ideological paralysis and neglect of disaster relief leadership, a large number of sideline businesses were suspended, resulting in a lack of food and affecting spring plowing.

    This year, various localities generally paid attention to propaganda and education for the masses, through various meetings, organizing and using various forces. Various counties throughout the province have successively held people's representative conferences, labor model conferences, party representative conferences, farmer representative conferences, women's representative conferences, etc., to give play to the strength of all strata. Jointly implement policies and complete tasks. For example, the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference in Lingxian and Linzi Counties in the Bohai Region, the Second People's Representative Conference in Shanghe, and the People's Representative Conference in Licheng County in the Lu Zhongnan Region all focused on discussing spring plowing and disaster relief work. Production and disaster relief policies were publicized. Some counties and districts in Laiwu, Junan, Ziyang, and Feixian in the Lu Zhongnan Region also held party member training classes and party member meetings before spring plowing, clarifying that production is the basic task of the branch, and therefore played a role in promoting leadership in production.

    In this year's spring plowing, various localities have generally paid attention to grasping the basic link of "organization." According to statistics from six counties (all old areas) in Feixian and Cangshan in the Lu Zhongnan Region, nearly 20,000 labor exchange groups were organized and developed before spring plowing, with 160,000 men and women participating in full labor. Yishui has newly developed 1,226 groups this spring, and 69 percent of the full labor force has participated in labor exchange groups, achieving the organization of the majority. Due to the leadership of the branch, labor exchange groups are gradually moving towards consolidation. In the new areas, due to the weak foundation, a policy of gradual development is generally adopted, such as very small-scale mutual aid forms such as plowshare groups and weeding groups. The main problems existing in the current organization of labor exchange are insufficient mastery of equal value exchange and weak leadership. For example, in Yishui County, only 794 out of ten districts implemented work point accounting. In the Binbei Special District, a total of 36,780 groups were organized, and only 6,905 groups implemented work point accounting or were preparing to do so, while the rest mostly became formalism, which urgently needs to be rectified and improved.

    There has been considerable progress in the work of tilling land on behalf of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families this year. The Lu Zhongnan Region generally carried out rectification before spring plowing. Old areas such as Taishan and Yimeng generally implemented fixed tilling. Eleven villages in Yiyuan County also implemented a contract system. The Bohai Region also widely used fixed tilling, and some areas in Cangxian County also signed tilling contracts. However, according to understanding, there are still some problems in tilling in various places that need to be improved. In the new areas and individual old areas, the un guaranteed big-group work still exists, so the production of military families is still not guaranteed.

    The policy of protecting cattle has improved compared with last year, and the phenomenon of infringing on the interests of cattle owners during spring plowing in various places has been significantly reduced. Some counties and districts in Yimeng, Taishan, and Nishan in the Lu Zhongnan Region implemented advance payment of cattle grass for borrowing cattle, solving the difficulties of cattle-raising households. Ziyang in the Nishan Special District advanced more than 139,000 catties of cattle grass and 119 catties of cattle feed in five districts. However, in some counties and districts, due to the failure to conscientiously implement the cattle protection policy, phenomena such as forced borrowing and white use still exist, hindering spring plowing.

    Although spring plowing has ended in the province, various localities still have some uncultivated land, and most of the uncultivated land is for households in difficulty who have fled the famine, as well as some pending cases and wasteland. For example, 428 mu of pending case land has been found in Ziyang County, and more than 20,000 mu of wasteland has been found in Donghai County. How to complete these uncultivated lands, combine disaster relief, and sow seeds on time still requires serious efforts.

　　组织起来克服灾荒困难
    山东春耕已大体完成
    【本报讯】据山东大众日报消息：山东全省春耕在与严重的灾荒斗争中，已大体完成，并普遍转入春种。据四月七日前后了解，鲁中南区春地平均已耕达百分之九十，除少部地区外，大苗地已耕完，并普遍播种。胶东区农民一般至清明前后春耕大体结束。如滨北专区至三月底，除藏马外，其他各县均耕起百分之九十。西海专区大部及南海专区平东、平西，北海专区南部之栖东、栖西等县均先后大体结束，部分地区已下种，西海专区昌南县三月底已耩上谷子，东海专区荣成东部，为早早种上庄稼好出海打鱼，不少的户已种上苞米。渤海区因去年冬耕地多（达百分之八十），为今年春耕减少了不少困难，春耕现已大体结束。
    今年春耕是在严重的灾荒情况下进行的，各地领导机关均以生产救灾为压倒一切的中心任务，抽调大批干部加强领导，一般的逐渐掌握到春耕与救灾结合进行。各地强调实行组织起来，通过变工组分工进行春耕与副业生产，既不误春耕，又救了灾。但有部分地区领导上掌握有偏差，春耕进行迟缓。如鲁中南区尼山专区大部县及台枣专区之湖西四县，干部存在着“灾情严重，饿死人要负责任，春耕晚一点不要紧”的思想，因而忽视春耕领导，进度迟缓。台枣专区湖西四县，至今才耕起百分之六十，尼山专区济北县本月上旬尚未耕起一半。而灾轻区如泰山、沂蒙等专区，由于领导思想麻痹，忽视救灾领导，使副业大批停歇，造成食粮无着，也影响到春耕。
    今年各地一般均注意到对群众的宣传教育，通过各种会议，组织运用各种力量。全省各县先后普遍开过各界人民代表会议、劳动模范会议、党代表会议、农民代表会议、妇女代表会议等，发挥各阶层的力量。共同贯彻政策完成任务，如渤海区陵县、临淄等县人民代表会议常委会、商河二届人民代表会议、鲁中南历城等县人民代表会议均着重讨论了春耕救灾工作。宣传了生产救灾政策，鲁中南莱芜、莒南、滋阳、费县等部分县区，在春耕前并曾举办党员轮训班、党员大会，明确了生产是支部的基本任务，因此在生产中都起到推动领导作用。
    今年春耕中，各地对“组织起来”这一基本环节，一般已重视掌握。据鲁中南费县、苍山等六个县（均系老区）统计，春耕前整理发展的变工组近两万，参加男女整劳力达十六万人。沂水今春新发展一千二百二十六组，参加变工组的整劳力已达百分之六十九，达到大部组织起来。由于支部的领导，变工组渐渐走向巩固。在新区，因基础薄弱，一般多采取逐步发展的方针，如搿犋组、剜地组等规模很小的互助形式。目前组织变工中存在的主要问题是等价交换掌握不够及领导薄弱，如沂水县十个区中仅有七百九十四个实行计工算账。滨北专区组织起来的共有三万六千七百八十个组，实行计工算账或正准备记工算账的仅有六千九百零五个组，其余多流于形式主义，亟待整理提高。
    烈军工属的代耕工作，今年有不少进步。鲁中南区在春耕前普遍进行了整理，泰山、沂蒙等老区普遍实行了固定代耕，沂源县十一个村并实行了包干制。渤海区亦较广泛的运用了固定代耕，沧县部分地区并签定了代耕合同。但据了解，各地在代耕中尚存在若干问题有待改进。在新区与个别老区，无保证的大拨工依然存在，因此军属的生产仍无保证。
    护牛政策贯彻较去年已有提高，各地春耕中侵犯牛主利益现象显著减少。鲁中南区沂蒙、泰山、尼山部分县区借牛使用实行预支牛草，解决养牛户困难。尼山专区的滋阳有五个区预支牛草十三万九千多斤，牛料一百一十九斤。但部分县区由于未能认真贯彻护牛政策，强借白使等现象仍有，妨碍春耕。
    目前全省春耕虽已结束，但各地均有若干未耕地，而未耕地多半是困难户逃荒户，并有某些悬案地、荒地，如滋阳县已发现悬案地四百二十八亩，东海县发现荒地两万多亩。如何完成这些未耕地，结合救灾按时下种，仍需要严重努力。
