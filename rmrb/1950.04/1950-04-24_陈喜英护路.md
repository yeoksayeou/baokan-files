　　Chen Xiying Protects the Railway
　　Near the railway by the Pingdiquan Station, farmer Chen Xiying was plowing the field with a yellow ox when suddenly four people came walking along the railway from the west. When they reached the crossing, one of them squatted down. After a long while, he stood up, kicked at something twice with his foot, and then chased after the other three heading east. Chen Xiying was far away and couldn’t see what he was doing, but he felt that this traveler's actions were suspicious. He quickly stopped his work and ran to the crossing to see what was happening. He discovered that two large stones had been stuffed between the guard rail and the base rail of the crossing. He quickly used all his strength to remove the stones. At that moment, he wanted to catch the villain, but realizing he was outnumbered, he rushed back to the village and reported it to the militia team. The militia team immediately dispatched people to pursue and arrest them. At that moment, the No. 132 express train from Baotou to Beijing, fully loaded with passengers, safely passed through the crossing and sped away! As the train rounded the bend in the mountains, the militiamen captured the person who had stuffed the stones, three miles away.

　　陈喜英护路
    平地泉车站附近的铁路旁，农民陈喜英，正套着黄牛耕地，忽然由西方顺着铁道走来了四个人。他们走到横道口上，有一个人就蹲在那里，好半天工夫才站起来，还又使脚踢了两下，便往东追随那三个人去了。陈喜英离的很远，看不清他究竟干啥，但总觉得这个行路人的动作可疑，便急忙放下自己的工作，跑到道口去一看，才发现道口的护轮轨和基轨间塞进去两块大石头。他便连忙用劲把这石头取出来。当时他想把这个坏蛋抓住，但一想，觉得寡不敌众，便急忙跑回村里，报告了民兵队。民兵队马上派人追捕去了。这时，由包头开往北京的一三二次大票车，满载了旅客安全的通过了道口，飞快的过去了！当列车拐过了山湾的时候，民兵们就把跑出三里路以外塞石头的人捕回来了。
