　　Famine in Various Regions Ceases to Develop
    With Effective Use of Relief Grain and Funds for Production and Self-Salvation, We Are Fully Confident in Further Overcoming the Spring Famine
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] According to reports from various regions and actual investigations, the famine in disaster areas across the country has basically ceased to develop. The disaster situation in severely affected areas such as Hebei, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Shandong, and Pingyuan has also stabilized. In Hebei Province, after two to three months of vigorously organizing sideline production, the food rations and production funds for disaster victims have been resolved. Disaster victims in northern Anhui have received a total of over 300 million jin of grain from production loans, work-relief programs, and relief grain from governments at all levels, providing a substantial material guarantee for production and disaster relief. Work-relief programs for river management in northern Jiangsu and the organization of sideline production have solved the food rations for over three million disaster victims until the wheat harvest, and many areas have already begun to subsist on spring vegetables. The existing material resources in Pingyuan Province can enable 2.7 million disaster victims to survive for two and a half months. The vast majority of disaster victims in Shandong Province can achieve self-salvation through production, with only about 15% being completely dependent on relief. In other provinces with lighter disaster situations, such as the disaster area in western Liaoning Province, the people have not only solved their food rations by fully organizing sideline production, but many places also have surplus grain to purchase carts, livestock, and farm implements.

    At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the number of disaster victims nationwide reached 40 million, but among them, only 7 million disaster victims, who suffered from severe floods due to years of destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army before liberation, were truly in urgent need of relief. Over the past two to three months, thanks to the Central People's Government's allocation of 1.2 billion jin of grain for disaster relief and the arduous organizational work carried out by governments at all levels, which fully led the people in disaster areas to engage in production and self-salvation, and extensively mobilized social mutual assistance, the severe famine has finally ceased to develop. In the next one to two months, as long as all regions continue to implement the方針 of production and disaster relief, effectively use relief grain and funds, organize manpower, animal power, and material resources, focus on spring plowing, and closely integrate it with river management projects or sideline production, we are fully confident in further overcoming the spring famine.

　　各地灾荒停止发展
    只要有效使用救济粮款生产自救我们完全有把握进一步战胜春荒
    【新华社八日讯】根据各地报告和实际调查，全国各灾区灾荒基本上已停止发展，重灾区如河北、皖北、苏北、山东、平原等地灾情亦已稳定。河北省经两三个月来大力组织副业生产，灾民口粮和生产资金已获解决。皖北灾民因获得各级人民政府的生产贷粮、以工代赈粮、救济粮等共三亿余斤，已有充分的生产救灾的物质保证。苏北治河工程的以工代赈和组织副业生产，已解决三百余万灾民到麦收前的口粮，并且不少地区已接上吃春菜度日。平原省现有物资力量，已可使二百七十万灾民渡过两个半月的生活。山东省灾民绝大部分可以生产自救，完全待救济者仅百分之十五左右。其他灾情较轻的如辽西省灾区人民，由于全力组织副业生产，不仅解决了口粮，而且不少地方还有余粮，添购大车、牲口、农具等。
    在去年底今年初时，全国灾民曾达四千万，但其中真正急待救济者，仅为因解放前国民党匪军的多年破坏摧残而遭受巨大水灾的七百万灾民。两三个月以来，由于中央人民政府先后拨粮十二亿斤进行救灾，各级人民政府亦进行了艰巨的组织工作，全力领导灾区人民生产自救，并广泛发动社会互济，终使严重的灾荒停止发展。今后的一两个月内，只要各地继续贯彻生产救灾的方针，有效地使用救灾粮款，组织人力、畜力和物力，以春耕为中心并密切结合治河工程或副业生产，进一步战胜春荒是完全有把握的。
