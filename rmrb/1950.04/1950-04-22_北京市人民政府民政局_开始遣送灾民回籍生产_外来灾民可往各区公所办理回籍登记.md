　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has begun repatriating disaster victims to their native places for production. Last year, Hebei and other provinces suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, windstorms, and hail, and some disaster victims fled to Beijing. Among them, the most numerous were those from Xianghe, Sanhe, and Ji County under the Tongxian Special District of Hebei Province, and Baodi and Anci Counties under the Tianjin Special District. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has made every effort to resettle them by introducing temporary work, transferring them to Chahar and Suiyuan to participate in production, and distributing relief grain. However, some disaster victims remain in Beijing without a means of livelihood. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has decided to mobilize and repatriate the displaced disaster victims as soon as possible so as not to delay production. Affected areas such as the Tongxian Special District have also sent people to Beijing to assist. From now on, all displaced disaster victims can go to the district offices in each district to register for repatriation. After being grouped together, they will be transported collectively by special vehicles dispatched by the Beijing Transportation Company of the Highway Administration, organized by county. Ordinary disaster victims will be allowed to purchase tickets at 70% of the price. For those who are truly financially distressed, the Beijing Municipal People's Government will provide appropriate subsidies for part of the fare or travel living expenses. The first group of 313 disaster victims has been assembled and will depart within days.

    开始遣送灾民回籍生产
    外来灾民可往各区公所办理回籍登记
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府开始遣送外来灾民回籍生产。去年河北等省遭受水旱风雹等灾害，部分灾民逃来北京，其中以河北省通县专署所辖香河、三河、蓟县及天津专署所辖宝坻、安次等县最多。京市人民政府民政局曾以介绍临时工作、移送察绥参加生产和发放救济粮等方式尽力予以安置，但仍有部分灾民，留在北京，生活无着。现已到春耕时节，市民政局为使不误生产，决动员遣送外来灾民从速回籍；各受灾地区如通县专署等亦已派人来京协助。自即日起，所有外来灾民可往各区区公所办理回籍登记，经集中编组后即以县为单位由公路总局北京运输公司派专车集体运送。一般灾民准予七成购票乘车，对于确实经济困难者将由京市人民政府酌情补助部分车费或旅途生活费。首批灾民三百十三人已集中编组完毕，日内即可动身。
