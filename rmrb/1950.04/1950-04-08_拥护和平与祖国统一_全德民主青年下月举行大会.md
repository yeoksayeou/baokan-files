Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 7th: The All-German Democratic Youth Congress will be held in Berlin at the end of May. Representatives from the International Union of Students will be invited to participate. At that time, 500,000 German youths will join youths from other countries in holding a grand celebration and demonstration to uphold the cause of peace and German unification. The International Union of Students has called on all member organizations to do their utmost to support the preparations for the congress, and announced that the International Union of Students will award a banner to the student group of the Free German Youth that has done the best job in preparing for the congress. However, in West Germany, according to a TASS dispatch on the 5th, the West German occupation authorities are using violent force to deal with German youth who are preparing for the All-German Democratic Youth Congress. In West Berlin alone, more than two hundred young men and women have been arrested in the past few weeks and subjected to trials by the military courts of the United States, Britain, and France. The democratic youth of West Germany are now responding to this atrocity by the British and American authorities and the Adenauer government by intensifying preparations for the All-German Youth Congress.
