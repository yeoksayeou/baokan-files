"Day of Support for the Struggle of Spanish Democratic Youth"

　　April 14, 1931, is the anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Republic. In 1936, Franco, with the support of Hitler, Mussolini, and imperialists from the United States, Britain, and France, launched a brutal counter-revolutionary civil war, and the Spanish people bravely fought against the Franco fascists. Since then, every year on April 14th, the Spanish people commemorate this day, which represents a strong will to fight. In 1948, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students designated this day as "Day of Support for the Struggle of Spanish Democratic Youth," calling on democratic youth from all countries to strengthen their support for the Spanish fighting youth who are opposing Franco's fascist rule.
　　Franco's fascist rule, with the support of American imperialism and its accomplices, is now not only intensifying all anti-democratic crimes within the country, but is also attempting to turn Spain into a military base for launching a new world war. Therefore, supporting the anti-Franco fascist struggle waged by Spanish youth is part of the worldwide democratic youth movement for peace and democracy.

　　“支援西班牙民主青年斗争日”
    一九三一年四月十四日是西班牙共和国诞生的纪念日。至一九三六年佛朗哥得到希特勒、莫索里尼和英美法等帝国主义者的支持，发动了凶恶的反革命内战，西班牙人民便英勇地向佛朗哥法西斯分子展开了斗争。以后每年的四月十四日，西班牙人民都纪念着这代表坚强斗争意志的一天。一九四八年，世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会把这一天定为“支援西班牙民主青年斗争日”，号召各国民主青年，加强支援反对佛朗哥法西斯统治的西班牙战斗青年。
    佛朗哥法西斯统治在美国帝国主义及其帮凶的支持下，现在不但变本加厉地在国内进行一切反民主罪行，而且正企图将西班牙变成发动新世界战争的军事基地。因此，支援西班牙青年所进行的反佛朗哥法西斯统治的斗争，是全世界民主青年争取和平民主运动中的一部分。
