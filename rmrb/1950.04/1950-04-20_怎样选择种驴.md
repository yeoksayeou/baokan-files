How to Select a Breeding Donkey
To the Editor:
    In order to breed livestock in the spring, I would like to introduce the standards for selecting breeding donkeys to everyone.
    1. The body should be full and the parts well-proportioned.
    2. Coat color: Large donkeys are black, medium donkeys are chestnut, smooth and shiny; the mouth, eye circles, and belly are fish-white.
    3. The back should be straight.
    4. The waist should be muscular, full, and level, and the buttocks should be smooth.
    5. The chest should be broad.
    6. The limbs should be moderately developed (neither too thick nor too thin is good; the saying "the hind legs of a breeding donkey should be thick" commonly heard in breeding shops is incorrect).
    7. The head and body size should be proportionate, the bridge of the nose should be vertical, and the eyes should be round, staring, and bright.
    8. The ears should be flexible.
    9. Height: Large donkeys should be more than four Chinese feet tall; medium donkeys should be more than three Chinese feet tall.
    10. Weight: Large donkeys should weigh more than six hundred Chinese catties; medium donkeys should weigh more than four hundred Chinese catties.

　　怎样选择种驴编辑同志：
    为了在春季繁殖力畜，我愿把选择种驴的标准介绍给大家。
    一、体格丰满，各部均称。
    二、毛色：大型驴黑色，中型驴栗色，平滑有光泽；嘴、眼圈、肚皮为鱼白色。
    三、脊背平直。
    四、腰部筋肉丰满、水平，臀部更要平滑。
    五、胸围宽大。
    六、四肢要发育适度（太粗太细都不好，一般配种店所说“种驴后腿要粗”是不正确的）。
    七、头和身体大小配称，鼻梁垂直，眼圆瞪、有神。
    八、两耳灵活。
    九、体高：大型驴要在四市尺以上；中型驴要在三市尺以上。
    十、体重：大型驴要在六百市斤以上；中型驴要在四百市斤以上。
