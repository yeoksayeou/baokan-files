	Grow More Grain to Thank Chairman Mao
	Zhao Sen
	The warm spring is a good time for production. Li Jiyue and her mother, like other liberated peasants, get up very early. One person goes out to collect manure with a manure basket, and the other stays at home mixing mud and making adobe bricks to replace the kang soil as fertilizer. More fertilizer will ensure the completion of the 1950 production plan.
	Jiyue is seventeen years old this year. Seven or eight years ago, when she was eight or nine years old, her father was shot by the Japanese devils for leading a workers' strike. The family was so poor that they had nothing. The mother and daughter had to rent six and a half mu of land from the landlord "Zhang Erye" and endure a hard life. The grain they worked so hard to harvest each year was used to pay "Zhang Erye" rent and miscellaneous expenses, and the remaining grain was gone in just a few days. Jiyue often woke up in the middle of the night and asked her mother, "Mom! We work so hard all day long, why can't we get enough to eat?" Her mother comforted her and said, "Child, go to sleep. When you grow up, we'll rent two more mu of land to plant, maybe it will be enough to eat." Jiyue continued to sleep. She didn't know that her mother's hot tears often soaked the bedding!
	With the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, the poor peasants were finally saved. Tangshan was liberated at the end of 1948. In the early spring of 1950, land reform began in the suburbs of Tangshan. Because Jiyue and her mother were orphans without labor, everyone took special care of them. In addition to the six and a half mu of land they had rented from "Zhang Erye" in previous years, which was still for his use, they were given another two mu and one fen of garden land (double-cropping land) on the edge of the village, a total of eight mu and six fen of land. They were also given a few scattered farm tools. The mother and daughter were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths. At the land distribution meeting, Jiyue said to everyone, "If it weren't for the People's Government, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao leading the poor to turn over, my mother and I would never have gotten our own land to cultivate in our lifetime. We must cultivate the land well to thank the People's Government, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao." Jiyue and her mother planned to plant all six and a half mu of land with sorghum. They planned to use river mud as base fertilizer when sowing, and add eight carts of manure after the seedlings emerge. They would hoe the land twice and level it four times, ensuring a yield of one stone and five dou per mu (the usual yield is one stone, two or three dou). They would plant two mu and one fen of garden land with cowpeas to sell for pocket money. They worked from early morning till late at night, thinking only of responding to Chairman Mao's call for increased production, applying more fertilizer, cultivating diligently, and growing more grain.

　　多打粮食感谢毛主席
    赵森
    暖和的春天，是生产的好时光。李季月和母亲与其他翻身的农民一样，很早就起来了。一个人背着粪箕子出门拾粪，一个人在家中和泥脱坯准备换下炕土作肥料。多上肥，好保证完成一九五○年的生产计划。
    季月今年十七岁。七八年前，当她八、九岁时，父亲因为领导工人罢工，被日本鬼子枪毙了。家里穷得什么也没有，母女两个人只得租种庄上地主“张二爷”的六亩半地，苦熬着日子。每年辛辛苦苦打下的粮食，除了给“张二爷”的地租杂费以外，剩余的粮食吃不几天就完了。季月时常在深夜醒来，问母亲：“妈妈！咱们整天作活，为啥整天吃不饱。”母亲安慰她说：“孩子，好好睡吧，等你长大了，咱们多租二亩地种，也许就够吃了。”季月继续睡去。她也不知道母亲的热泪常常浸湿了被褥！
    有了共产党，有了解放军，贫苦农民终于有救了。一九四八年底唐山解放，一九五○年的初春，唐山郊区开始了土地改革，季月母女俩，因属孤寡没有劳动力，大伙特别予以照顾，除往年租种“张二爷”的六亩半地仍归他使用外，另在村边又拨了二亩一分园子地（二季地），共八亩六分地，还分了几件零星的农具，母女俩简直乐得合不上嘴，在得地大会上，季月向大伙说：“要不是人民政府、共产党和毛主席领导穷人们翻身，俺娘俩一辈子也捞不着有自己的地种，我们一定要把地种得好好的来感谢人民政府、共产党和毛主席。”季月母女两个计划着：六亩半地全种成高粱。下种时以河泥作底粪，苗蓐开后追加八车大粪，要蓐二遍搒四遍，保证每亩打到一石五斗（常年一石二、三斗）。二亩一分园子种豆角，卖钱好零用。她们每天起早带晚工作着，一心想着响应毛主席的增产号召，多施肥、勤耕作，多打粮食。
