[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Industrial and Commercial Tax for the second half of 1949 is scheduled to begin collection today (the 1st). In order to encourage industrial and commercial businesses to pay their taxes early, the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau has specially decided on reward measures. These measures are divided into collective awards and individual awards. Collective awards are as follows: 1. The first five industries city-wide that are assessed fairly and pay all taxes into the treasury will each be awarded a banner; 2. The first two industries in each tax sub-bureau (with 30 or more businesses) that are assessed fairly and reasonably and pay all taxes into the treasury will each be awarded a banner; 3. The top ten industry groups (with 10 or more businesses) that pay their taxes early will each be awarded a certificate; 4. The first area in the suburban market towns (such as Dongba, Haidian, etc.) to pay taxes into the treasury will be awarded a banner. Individual awards are as follows: 1. All assessment committee members and group leaders who demonstrate initiative and selflessness in the assessment and payment work will each be awarded a certificate; 2. Anyone who can take the lead in demonstrating a spirit of mutual assistance and promote the active and early tax payment of 30 or more businesses will be awarded a certificate; those who promote fewer than 30 businesses will be publicly commended; 3. Anyone who can create new methods under the principle of facilitating business and benefiting the people, so that tax payments are quickly deposited into the treasury, will be awarded a certificate.
