　　“A Pen, A Gun, and A Hoe on the Shoulder”
    ——A Record of the Production Movement of a Certain Division of the People's Liberation Army
    By Our Reporter Bai Yuan

    Chairman Mao said in the "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Production and Construction Work in 1950": "The People's Revolutionary Military Commission calls on the entire army, except for those continuing to fight and perform duties, to undertake a portion of production tasks, so that our People's Liberation Army will not only be a national defense force, but also a production force, in order to cooperate with the people of the whole country to overcome the difficulties left over from the long-term war and accelerate the economic construction of the new democracy." Now people can see how the army's production movement is flourishing under the call of Chairman Mao!
    A few days ago, I participated in a production mobilization meeting held by a certain division of the People's Liberation Army under the city wall of a small city in Chahar. At seven o'clock in the morning, the troops stationed in many villages marched into the meeting place with neat steps. One-third of the troops carried rifles, and two-thirds carried baskets and hoes on their shoulders. They gathered at the meeting place and solemnly swore: "In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call, for the construction of the motherland, we will resolutely complete the production tasks of the troops! In production, we will not forget that we are always a fighting team!"
    In front of the neat ranks, rows and rows of carrying poles composed of tens of thousands of baskets formed countless neat lines. One end of the carrying pole was placed with picks and shovels, and the other end was hung with a literacy sign, with various sentences written on it. They started the great review of production preparations here. In order to complete the troops' production tasks this year, they have made full preparations and set extremely detailed production plans. The main work of the entire division this year is to cultivate 5,500 mu of land, raise 3,000 sheep, raise 200 pigs, and contract with the government to dig 103 li of canals; in addition, there are many other production projects. Some projects have already started. The land has been plowed almost completely, and most of the fertilizer has been delivered to the ground. Not long ago, the first livestock team had already set off. They drove a flock of more than 1,000 sheep, passed through the Great Wall, and went to the grasslands of Zhangbei to graze. The soldiers of the entire division wove more than 8,000 baskets, and made 500 iron shovels (and bought 3,000 from outside), 200 picks, and 2,500 carrying poles in their own iron and wood factory. In one company, there was a model basket-weaving class, and two soldiers wove 130 baskets in ten days.
    The entire army greeted the production tasks assigned to them by Chairman Mao and the people of China in 1950 with the greatest joy and determination. At this time, the dance groups of each company performed the dances that have recently been widely developed in the army. They danced and sang: "A pen, a gun, and a hoe on the shoulder..." In the changing formations of various dances, they created many novel images from their actual lives to praise production, labor, and combat. The singing and music attracted the crowds watching the excitement in the city.
    Four days after the meeting, the canal digging team was about to set off. The canal digging site is located in Shanyin County, south of Datong, Chahar. In order to save expenses, after discussion in the troops, it was decided not to take the train, but to march to the canal digging site. This is a journey of 600 li. That morning, before dawn, the assembly bugle sounded throughout the various garrisons of the troops. The troops assembled as quickly as when they set off to fight. They carried baskets on their shoulders, just like when they held the conference that day, with picks and shovels on one end and literacy signs on the other. At this time last year, it was this same army that set off to fight Taiyuan. And now, from their garrison to Shanyin, they are walking almost in the same direction and along the same road as when they fought Taiyuan last year. The mighty army marched out of the garrison in the dim morning light, and threw themselves into the tide of New China's construction with their combat paces.

　　“一支钢笔一枝枪  一只锄头扛肩上”
    ——记人民解放军某师的生产运动
    本报记者  白原
    毛主席在“一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示”上说：“人民革命军事委员会号召全军，除继续作战和服勤务者而外，应当负担一部分生产任务，使我人民解放军不仅是一支国防军，而且是一支生产军，借以协同全国人民克服长期战争所遗留下来的困难，加速新民主主义的经济建设。”现在人们可以看见，军队的生产运动，在毛主席的号召之下，是如何蓬勃的开展起来了！
    几天以前，我在察哈尔一个小城的城墙下，参加了人民解放军某师所举行的生产动员大会。早上七点钟，驻扎在许多村子里的队伍就踏着齐整的步伐进了会场。队伍中有三分之一背着步枪，三分之二挑着筐，篮和镐锨。他们在会场里集合起来，在庄严的仪式中宣誓：“为了响应毛主席的号召，为了祖国的建设，坚决完成部队的生产任务！在生产当中，不忘记永远是个战斗队！”
    在整齐的队伍前面，成万只筐篮所组成的一副副担子排成了无数整齐的行列。担子的一头放着镐和锨，另一头挂着一块识字的牌牌，上面写着各色各样的字句。他们在这里开始了生产准备的大检阅。为了完成部队今年的生产任务，他们做了充分的准备工作，而且定下了极其详细的生产计划。全师主要的工作是今年耕种土地五千五百亩，养羊三千只，养猪二百口，向政府包工挖渠一百零三华里；另外还有许多生产项目。有些项目早已开始进行。土地差不多通通都耕过了一遍，大部分肥料已经送到了地上。不久以前，第一个畜牧队已经出发。他们赶着一千多只羊的羊群，踏过长城，往张北一带的草原去牧放。全师战士编了八千多只筐子，在自己开办的铁木工厂打了五百张铁锨（向外面买了三千张），二百把镐头，两千五百根担挑。在一个连里有一个编筐模范班，两个战士在十天当中编成了筐子一百三十只。
    整个部队以最大的愉快和决心来迎接毛主席和全中国人民在一九五○年所交给他们的生产任务。这时，各个连队的舞蹈组演出了最近在部队中普遍开展起来的舞蹈。他们舞着，唱着：“一支钢笔一枝枪，一只锄头扛肩上……”在各种舞蹈的变化的队形中，从他们的实际生活创造出许多新颖的形象来歌颂生产、劳动和战斗。歌声和乐声吸引了全城的看热闹的人群。
    开过会以后的第四天，挖渠的队伍就要出发了。挖渠的地点是在察哈尔大同以南的山阴县境内。为了节省开支，在部队里经过讨论，决定不坐火车，行军到达挖渠的地点。这是一段长达六百里的行程。那一天早晨，天还没有亮，集合的号声就响遍了部队的各个驻地。队伍和出发去作战的时候一样迅速的集合起来。他们挑着筐担，就和那天开大会的时候一样，一头挑着镐和锨，一头挑着识字的牌牌。去年这个时候，还是这一支队伍，他们出发去打太原。而现在，从他们的驻地到山阴去，差不多走着与去年打太原时的同一个方向，同一条道路。浩浩荡荡的队伍在迷蒙的晨光中走出了驻地，用他们战斗的步伐投进了新中国的建设的浪潮中。
