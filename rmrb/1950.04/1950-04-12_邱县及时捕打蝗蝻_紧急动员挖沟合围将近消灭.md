　　Qiu County Promptly Catches and Kills Locust Nymphs
    Emergency Mobilization to Dig Ditches and Encircle, Nearly Eliminating Them
    [Report from Handan, by our newspaper] On the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of this month, locust nymphs appeared in 54 villages in Qiu County, Hebei Province, with Xinji, Bei Wanglou, and Nie Lou villages in the Second District being the most severely affected. These locust nymphs all appeared in wasteland around graves, kilns, rivers, rows of trees, roadside ditches, field edges, and a small number of fields that were not winter-plowed last year. No locust nymphs appeared in fields that were winter-plowed or wheat fields last year. Upon discovering this, the county and district leaders immediately mobilized the masses to catch and kill them. In just the two days of the 2nd and 3rd, more than 6,600 people were mobilized. In the Third District, 1,700 people were mobilized on the 2nd alone, eliminating them from more than 1,000 mu of land, and they were caught and killed three or four times each.
    The method used for catching and killing was encirclement. The most effective method was to dig more small ditches in the nymph-infested fields and drive the nymphs into the ditches to eliminate them. In order to eradicate the regeneration of locust nymphs, Dajia Guo Village in the Second District plowed more than 90 mu of the land that had been caught and killed.
    When the locust nymphs were first discovered, the masses had a paralyzing thought, believing that the nymphs would not cause a disaster and were afraid of delaying production because of the spring plowing. Based on the above thinking, the leadership first unified the thinking of the village cadres, established a locust-fighting headquarters, and educated the masses with the lesson of suffering from paralysis in locust-fighting last year, and immediately organized a wide range of capture and killing. By the 4th, the entire county had largely been nearly eliminated. All eleven villages in the Third District where locust nymphs were found, and most of the Fourth District, have been eliminated. Inspections are now underway to completely eliminate them.

　　邱县及时捕打蝗蝻
    紧急动员挖沟合围将近消灭
    【本报邯郸讯】本月一、二、三日，河北邱县先后有五十四村发生蝗蝻，以二区辛集、北王楼、聂楼等村较严重。这些蝗蝻均发生在坟荒、窑荒、河荒、树行、路沟、地头，以及去年未进行冬耕的少数地里。凡去年冬耕及麦地均未生蝗蝻。县、区领导上发现后，即动员群众进行捕打，仅二、三两日，就动员群众六千六百余人。三区二日一天动员群众一千七百余人，消灭一千余亩，且均捕打过三四遍。
    捕打都用合围的办法。最有效的是在生蝻地里多挖些小沟，将蝻子赶到沟内消灭之。二区大家郭庄为了根绝蝗蝻的再生，捕打过的地，跟着就犁起九十多亩。
    开始发现蝗蝻时群众有麻痹思想，认为蝻子成不了灾，正在春耕怕耽误生产。领导上根据以上思想，首先打通村干部思想，建立打蝗指挥部，用去年打蝗麻痹吃亏的教训，教育了群众，即组织了广泛捕打。至四日，全县大体已近消灭。三区发现蝗蝻的十一村全部，四区大部已经消灭。现正进行检查，以求彻底消灭。
