Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 5th—*Xinjiang Daily* published an editorial on March 31st entitled "Warmly Welcome the New Sino-Soviet Agreement," believing that the agreement signed in Moscow on March 27th regarding the establishment of two Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies is another great joyful news of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation and mutual assistance for the people of Xinjiang following the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and various other agreements. The editorial pointed out: The traditional friendship and sincere assistance of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people have been personally experienced by everyone in Xinjiang. It was only because of the shameful anti-Soviet criminal activities of the Kuomintang bandit gang and Sheng Shicai, the public enemy of the Xinjiang people, that this selfless friendship and assistance from the Soviet Union was severed, causing much disaster and loss to the people of Xinjiang. Now, thanks to the victory of the People's Liberation War throughout the country and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, there is the epoch-making Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and various agreements, and on this basis, the Sino-Soviet agreement on the establishment of two Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies has been signed. The editorial stated: With the signing of this agreement, large-scale exploration and mining of oil and non-ferrous metals, as well as various construction projects related to them, will begin in Xinjiang Province, which is of great significance to China's industrial construction, especially to the industrial construction of the new Xinjiang, and to the improvement of the political, economic, and cultural living standards of all ethnic groups. We, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, warmly welcome the arrival of Soviet experts and all personnel participating in the two Sino-Soviet companies, and are prepared to provide all possible assistance in future work. The editorial continued: We are unfamiliar with the construction of industrial and mining enterprises, and we are prepared to learn from scratch, and call on all industrial and mining organizations and talents in the province to prepare to participate in this great construction work and humbly learn from the advanced Soviet science, technology, and organizational skills. Various ideological and organizational preparations should become the practical content of our celebration of the new Sino-Soviet agreement.

　　新疆日报号召向苏联友人学习
    【新华社迪化五日电】新疆日报于三月三十一日以“热烈欢迎中苏新协定”为题发表社论，认为三月二十七日在莫斯科签订的关于创办两个中苏股份公司的协定，是中苏友好同盟互助条约及各项协定签订以后，又一次给新疆人民传来了中苏友好合作互助的大喜讯。社论指出：苏联对中国人民的传统友谊与真诚援助，是新疆每一个人都曾亲身体验过的。只是因为国民党匪帮与新疆人民公敌盛世才可耻的反苏罪恶活动的结果，才割断了苏联这种无私的友谊援助，使我们新疆人民蒙受了许多灾难与损失。如今由于人民解放战争在全国的胜利与中华人民共和国的成立，才有划时代的中苏友好同盟互助条约及各项协定之缔结，并在这一基础上又签订了中苏关于创办两个中苏股份公司的协定。社论称：随着这一协定的签字，大规模的探测、开采石油及有色金属的工作及与此有关的各项建设工程，将在新疆省开始，这对新中国的工业建设，特别是对新新疆的工业建设及各族人民的政治经济文化生活水平的提高有重大的意义。我们新疆各族人民热烈欢迎苏联专家及参加两中苏公司全部人员的来临，并准备在将来的工作中给予一切可能的帮助。社论继称：我们对于工矿业的建设事业是生疏的，我们准备从头学起，并号召全省一切工矿机关和工矿人材，应准备在参加这一伟大建设工作中，虚心地向苏联的先进科学技术与组织才能学习。各种思想上与组织上的准备工作，应该成为我们庆祝中苏新协定的实际内容。
