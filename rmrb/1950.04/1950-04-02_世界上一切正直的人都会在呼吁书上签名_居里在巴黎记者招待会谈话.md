　　All Honest People in the World Will Sign the Appeal
    Curie's Speech at a Press Conference in Paris
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch] Polish News Agency, Paris, March 31st Dispatch: Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, held a press conference in Paris, telling French and foreign journalists about the achievements of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee. He said: Consolidating peace is the desire of the vast majority of people. However, merely wanting peace cannot defend peace. This is why it is necessary to formulate specific action programs to defend peace, and this is also the purpose of the Standing Committee's recent meeting. Joliot-Curie further emphasized the need to organize peace committees in every town, village, and factory. He pointed out that it is necessary to clearly define common goals that can win the support of all people (regardless of their opinions and beliefs). Such goals have been put forward in the Standing Committee's appeal. Joliot-Curie concluded by saying: "There is no honest person in the world who would not sign the Standing Committee's appeal."
    In answering questions from reporters, Joliot-Curie declared: The Secretary of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress will be responsible for distributing the appeal adopted at the Stockholm meeting. The appeal will be distributed to local peace committees through national organizations. The appeal will be delivered to all the people of France and will be submitted to scientists and academies of sciences around the world.
