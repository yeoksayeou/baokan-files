　　Tokyo Overseas Chinese Newspaper Exposes
    Atrocity of Japanese寇Killing Captured Chinese Soldiers and Civilians
    Four Hundred and Sixteen of Our Soldiers and Workers Were Tortured and Killed in Akita Prefecture Before Japan's Surrender; Perpetrators Still at Large.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] Tokyo late news: The Overseas Chinese Newspaper published in Tokyo published on January 11th the truth about a major atrocity in which Japanese reactionaries massacred 416 captured Chinese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese workers at the Hanaoka Mine in Akita Prefecture, northern Honshu, on the eve of their surrender in 1945. The case is now more than four years old, but Japanese reactionaries, the American occupation authorities, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "mission to Japan" have consistently colluded to cover up the truth of the case. Last November, the Standing Committee of the League for the Promotion of Democracy of Overseas Chinese in Japan learned of the case and decided to conduct a thorough investigation. In December, the newspaper Overseas Chinese Newspaper, the organ of the League, sent reporters to the scene of the massacre to investigate the parties concerned, which brought the truth to light. The remains of 46 fellow victims who had been abandoned in the wilderness have been buried by the League.
    The following is an outline of the investigation report on the case by the newspaper's reporter, published in the Overseas Chinese Newspaper on January 11:
    Between July 1944 and June 1945, the Japanese government, through the pseudo "North China Labor Association," sent more than 900 Chinese soldiers and workers who had been captured in three batches to the Hanaoka Mine in Kitaakita-gun, Akita Prefecture, northern Honshu, and concentrated them in the "Nakayama Barracks" internment camp, where they were forcibly assigned by the Japanese construction company "Kajima Gumi" to do various harsh jobs in the local mines and surrounding areas. Many of them had already died of abuse on the ships and trains that transported them from China to Japan. According to Jiro Shibata, the former labor director of Kajima Gumi Construction Company, they were "mostly weakened to the extreme." However, after arriving at the Hanaoka Mine, they were often forced to do extremely cruel forced labor in a state of semi-starvation. According to Kyoichi Hatasawa, the former chief of the labor section of the Hanaoka Mine, each person was only allocated 11 kilograms of food per month. Hatasawa admitted that "this is unbearable for anyone doing heavy earthwork." Dr. Tadashi Ouchi, the former director of Hanaoka Hospital, also confirmed: "Kajima Gumi's methods were very cruel, there were often many patients, and the food allocation was very bad, with an average of about five or six deaths per month."
    On June 30, 1945, the captured Chinese soldiers and workers in "Nakayama Barracks," unable to endure any longer, angrily killed four Japanese who had been withholding their rations and were going to torture them to death sooner or later, and a Chinese traitor who worked as a cook, and escaped into the mountains. The next day, the Akita Prefecture authorities immediately mobilized all of the prefecture's Japanese military police, police, and fire brigades, and within five days, all of the escapees were rounded up and subjected to unprecedented torture and massacre in several open spaces under the direct command of Kamata, the chief of the Special Higher Police Section of Akita Prefecture.
    Japan and the United States Collude to Cover Up the Massacre
    According to Kim Il-soo, a local Japanese resident who witnessed the massacre and worked for Kajima Gumi Construction Company, the Japanese military police "did not give the arrested people food for four consecutive days, and even though it was the scorching summer, each person was only given a bowl of water a day, and they were constantly beaten with bamboo swords, bamboo spears, and clubs. The scene at that time was truly unbearable to witness. Large numbers of Chinese people were successively massacred in the open space, and those who were sent back to the internment camp also died one by one." According to statistics, a total of 416 Chinese soldiers and workers were tortured and killed out of the more than 900 captured in this batch. The bodies of the victims were thrown into large pits that had been dug in advance on the mountainside. When Japan surrendered, some of the bodies of the murdered compatriots were hastily dug up and burned in an attempt to destroy the evidence.
    Under the control of the Japanese military, news of this massacre was forbidden to be published. After Japan's surrender, the Yokohama Military Tribunal of MacArthur Headquarters did not sentence a few minor offenders until March 1, 1948, sentencing three guards to death and three lower-level personnel, including the director of the Kajima Gumi Construction Company office, to imprisonment. However, none of the senior officials of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare's Labor Bureau, the Planning Board's General Affairs Bureau, and the Ministry of Home Affairs' Criminal Protection Bureau, who were responsible for the massacre, were convicted. Kamata, the chief of the Special Higher Police Section of Akita Prefecture, who directly commanded the massacre, as well as 久安, the Akita Prefecture Governor, and 武冈宪一, the Akita Prefecture Police Chief, who should have been directly responsible, are still at large, and 武冈宪一 is still openly serving as the Director-General of Akita Prefecture.
    The Overseas Chinese Newspaper pointed out that, in fact, in addition to this massacre, similar massacres had also occurred in other parts of Japan, such as the Heiwa Mine in Hokkaido, Funakawa in Akita Prefecture, and 奥的与濑 (located in western Tokyo) in Asakawa. Judging from these facts, it is believed that the number of Chinese people who were killed by the clutches of Japanese imperialists in Japan during the war is incalculable.
    According to a report in the Japanese Communist Party newspaper Akahata on January 22, the Japanese government agencies in charge of handling captured Chinese soldiers and workers during the war of aggression against China, such as the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Labor Bureau, and the Planning Board, were quickly dissolved after Japan's surrender, and documents were burned to destroy evidence. Therefore, it is now impossible to determine exactly how many captured Chinese soldiers and workers Japan sent to Japan during the war of aggression against China and how they were tortured and killed. However, according to Mr. Shiohaki of the "China Research Institute," who specialized in investigating captured Chinese soldiers and laborers during the war, "about 160,000 to 170,000 Chinese prisoners were sent during the war." He said: "The abuse in the Japanese mainland was very serious."

　　东京华侨民报揭露
    日寇杀我被俘军民惨案
    我国士兵及工人四百一十六人在日本投降前于秋田县被虐杀，凶犯现仍逍遥法外。
    【新华社十二日讯】东京迟到消息：在东京出版的华侨民报，于一月十一日发表了日本反动派曾于一九四五年投降前夕，在日本本州北部花冈矿山虐杀被俘的中国士兵及被强征的中国工人四百一十六人的大惨案真相。该案迄今已四年有余，但日本反动派与美占领当局及蒋匪“驻日代表团”，曾始终相互勾结，掩盖该案的真相。去年十一月，旅日华侨民主促进会常委会闻悉该案端倪后，即决定进行彻底追究，十二月间该会机关报华侨民报派出记者赴惨案发生地点，向有关各方进行调查，才使该案真相大白。在当地已发现的被抛置荒野的四十六位被害同胞的遗骸，已经该会厚殓。
    华侨民报一月十一日所载该报记者关于该案调查报告的概要如下：
    日本政府在一九四四年七月至一九四五年六月间，利用伪“华北劳工协会”，先后将三批被俘的中国士兵和工人九百余人送到日本本州北部的秋田县北秋田郡花冈矿山，将他们集中在“中山寮”收容所，并交由日本大建筑公司“鹿岛组”强制分派在当地矿场一带做各种苛重工作。他们在被从中国押送日本途中的轮船和火车上，已有多人被虐待死亡。据前鹿岛组建筑公司劳工主任柴田二郎称：他们“多数都衰弱到极点”。但是，到了花冈矿山以后，他们又经常在半饥饿状态之下，被迫做极残酷的强制重力劳动。据前花冈矿山劳务股长畠泽恭一证实，他们每月每人只配给食粮十一公斤。畠泽恭一承认，“这对于做土工的重力劳动，是谁也经不起的”。前花冈医院院长大内正氏也证实：“鹿岛组的作法非常残酷，经常病人很多，食粮配给非常坏，普通每月平均要死亡五六人左右”。
    一九四五年六月三十日，在“中山寮”的被俘的中国士兵和工人，因忍无可忍，乃愤而将四个克扣他们口粮迟早要把他们虐待死的日本人和一个做厨师的汉奸杀死，并全体逃入山林。第二天，秋田县当局立即动员全县的日本宪兵、警察和警防团，结果在五天内将逃避者全部搜捕回来，并在秋田县特高课课长镰田的直接指挥下，分别在几处空地上施以空前未闻的虐杀。
    日美互相勾结  掩盖虐杀罪行
    据当时目睹惨案经过的当地日本居民、并在鹿岛组建筑公司工作的金一秀称：日本军警对被捕者“连续四天不给食物，虽是烈日当空的夏天，每人一天只给一碗水，其间并不断用竹刀、竹枪和棍棒殴打。当时的惨状真是不忍卒睹。大批中国人在空地上陆续被杀害，就是被送回收容所的人也都一个个倒毙”。据统计，这一批九百多被俘的中国士兵和工人被虐杀者共达四百一十六人。被害者的尸体都被投入预先在山腰掘好的大坑里，日本投降时，被害同胞的尸体又被慌忙地掘出一部分，加以烧毁，以湮没罪证。
    在日本军部的控制下，这一惨案的消息，被禁止发表。日本投降后，麦克阿瑟总部的横滨军事法庭直到一九四八年三月一日才判处了少数次要人犯，判处了三个警备员死刑和鹿岛组建筑公司办事处主任等三个下级人员的徒刑。而对虐杀案应负责任的当时日本厚生省勤劳局和企划院总合局以及内务省刑保局的高级人员，却一个也未判罪。虐杀案的当场指挥者秋田县特高课课长镰田，以及应负直接责任的秋田县知事久安和县警察部长武冈宪一，迄今仍逍遥法外，而武冈宪一现在仍公然任秋田县总务部长之职。
    华侨民报指出：实际上，除了这一件惨案以外，在日本国内其他地区，如北海道平和矿山、秋田县船川以及浅川奥的与濑（按在东京西部）等地，也曾发生过同样的虐杀事件。由这些事实来观察，相信战时在日本国内被日本帝国主义者的魔掌所残杀的中国人民，其数目是难以计算的。
    另据日本共产党机关报赤旗报一月二十二日载称：日本在进行侵华战争期间处理中国被俘军人及工人的主管机关大东亚省、内务省、厚生省勤劳局、企划院等，在日本投降后即行迅速解散，并烧毁文件，以消灭罪证。因此，日本在侵华战争期间究竟把多少被俘的中国军人和工人送到日本，及如何加以虐杀的情形，现已无法确知。但据战时专事调查中国被俘军人与劳工的“中国研究所”的盐胁氏称：“战时送来的中国俘虏大约有十六七万人”他说：“在日本内地的虐待是很厉害的。”
