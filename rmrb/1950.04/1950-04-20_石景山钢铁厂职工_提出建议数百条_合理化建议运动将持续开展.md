Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers
Offer Hundreds of Suggestions
Rationalization Proposal Campaign to Continue

[Our Newspaper] Reporter Yi Bing reports: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently launched a rationalization proposal campaign, and the workers have put forward many constructive suggestions, which is an extremely valuable gain for the plant. The content of the suggestions covers hundreds of items including production plans, production organization, factory management systems, leadership style, economizing on materials, and improving safety equipment, fully demonstrating the unparalleled enthusiasm of the vast majority of workers and staff in cherishing national property and doing a good job in production. The deployment and development of this campaign also reflects that the plant leadership's thinking on the principle of "relying on workers and developing production" has gradually become clear.

Most of the suggestions focus on production. Regarding production plans, the iron smelting plant proposed that "the formulation of production plans must involve a comprehensive study by the entire plant. In order to complete the production tasks, all departments must cooperate closely. For example, the iron smelting plant must cooperate with external raw materials, coke, the laboratory, the machine repair plant, and the transportation section to complete the production tasks." Regarding "reducing costs and improving quality," the technology department proposed "expediting the preparation work before implementing the 'six fixings' – fixed personnel, fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed materials, fixed costs, fixed efficiency," "strictly reviewing and implementing the budget system," and "unifying the maintenance work of the entire plant to save manpower and material waste." The iron smelting plant proposed "launching a campaign for all plant employees and their families to collect scrap iron." The power plant proposed "using coal washing stones (waste) and Datong coal for combined combustion to save fuel coal," and so on. Regarding the production management system, all units requested the establishment of inspection, reward and punishment, and business coordination meeting systems. In particular, the plant's skilled workers, based on their skilled daily technical operations and component performance, put forward many improvement methods, and they enthusiastically suggested even small things like saving a screw.

In order to overcome shortcomings and do a good job in production, the employees also made relatively strict demands on leaders at all levels. For example, Gao Runzhi of the technology department proposed the method of "periodically reviewing the leadership style," "first, the employee groups put forward opinions, and the leaders answer them periodically, and carry out criticism and self-criticism." He believes that "this will not only not reduce the leadership's prestige, but will unite the masses more closely and can measure the degree of awareness of the masses." Because the duties of cadres were not clearly defined in the past, resulting in confusion in the work, they demanded that cadres scientifically divide their work and clarify the responsibilities of each cadre.

Most of the suggestions put forward by the workers focus on improving production, reforming the old system and organization, and very few suggestions are made regarding their own welfare matters. This shows that the workers have fully realized that only by developing production can living conditions be improved. This is correct for the workers, but as the person in charge of the entire plant, one should, based on the existing material conditions, distinguish the priorities and gradually improve the safety equipment in the plant and promote the welfare undertakings of the workers.

This campaign fully proves that only by relying on the workers and giving full play to the strength and wisdom of all employees can production be improved. The valuable gains of this campaign will increase the confidence of the plant's leaders in "running the factory well." In fact, the plant leaders have cherished this harvest and are now preparing to establish a "Rationalization Proposal Committee" and are drafting "Rationalization Proposal Reward Regulations," etc., to keep this campaign going. At the same time, various units of the plant have acted on these suggestions according to their importance and urgency, which has greatly encouraged the employees' enthusiasm for increasing production.

　　石景山钢铁厂职工
    提出建议数百条
    合理化建议运动将持续开展
    【本报讯】记者一兵报道：石景山钢铁厂最近展开合理化建议运动，职工们提出许多建设性建议，这是该厂极可宝贵的收获。建议内容包括生产计划、生产组织、工厂管理制度、领导作风、撙节器材及改善安全设备等数百条，充分表现出该厂绝大多数工人和职员爱护祖国财产、搞好生产的无比热情。这一运动的布置和开展，也反映出该厂领导思想上对“依靠工人，发展生产”的方针已逐渐明确。
    大部分建议着重在生产方面，关于生产计划，炼铁厂提出“订生产计划，必须全厂展开全面性的研究，为了完成生产任务，各部门必须密切配合，如炼铁厂要和外来原料、焦炭、化验室、机修厂、运输课等配合，才能完成生产任务。”关于“减低成本、提高质量”，技术室提出“从速完成实行‘六定’——定员、定质、定量、定料、定成本、定效率——前的准备工作”、“严格审核与执行预算制度”、“统一全厂维护工作，以节省人力物力的浪费”。炼铁厂提出“发动全厂职工家属检废铁运动”。动力厂提出“利用洗煤石（废料）和大同煤合烧，节省燃煤”等等。关于生产管理制度，各单位均要求建立检查、奖惩、业务碰头会等制度。特别是各厂技术工人，在他们熟练了的日常技术操作和机件性能上，提出许多改进办法，尽管小至节省一颗螺丝钉，他们也踊跃的建议。
    为克服缺点，搞好生产，职工们对各级领导也提出了比较严格的要求。如技术室高润芝提出“定期检讨领导作风”的办法，“先由职工小组提出意见，领导上定期答复，展开批评和自我批评。”他认为“这样不但不会减损领导威信，反而会更加团结群众，并可测量群众的觉悟程度。”由于过去干部职责没有明确地划分，形成工作上的混乱现象，因此他们要求干部科学地分工，分清每一干部的职责。
    职工们提出的建议，大部分着重改进生产、改革旧的制度和组织，对于他们本身的福利事宜提的很少，这说明职工们已充分了解到只有发展生产，才能改善生活条件。这对职工们来说是正确的，但作为全厂的负责人，就应当就现有物质条件，分清轻重缓急，逐步改善厂内安全设备，增进职工福利事业。
    这一运动充分证明只有依靠工人，发挥全体职工的力量和智慧，才能搞好生产。这一运动珍贵的收获，将增加该厂领导同志“办好工厂”的信心。事实上该厂领导上已珍视这一收获，现正准备成立“合理化建议委员会”、正在草拟“合理化建议奖励条例”等，使这一运动持续的开展下去；同时该厂各单位针对这些建议，已按轻重缓急，行动起来了，这大大鼓舞了职工们增加生产的情绪。
