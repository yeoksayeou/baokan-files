[Beijing Municipal News Agency] In accordance with the State Council's decision to change grain processing standards and increase edible grain, the Beijing Municipal People's Government previously instructed the Beijing Municipal Grain Corporation to study the manufacturing standards for "August 1st Flour." Results have been achieved, and it is now specifically stipulated that the "Beijing Tongfen" produced by the Corporation will be the Beijing standard August 1st flour. From the 15th onward, all public and private flour mills (including processing factories and workshops) in the city must cease manufacturing or processing flour exceeding this standard (lower standards are not restricted) in order to reduce waste, increase food rations, and improve nutrition. Otherwise, once discovered, penalties will be imposed according to the severity of the circumstances. Regarding flour exceeding the standard currently held by manufacturers in the city, they will still be permitted to register and sell it. Public manufacturers should register at the Grain Exchange, private manufacturers at their respective trade associations, and vendors at their respective vendor market management offices, all before the 20th of this month. Failure to report by the deadline will result in prohibition of sale. Flour transported to Beijing from other areas must have certification from relevant local authorities and be declared to the Bureau of Commerce for approval before it can be sold in the market. "Beijing Tongfen" produced by the Beijing Municipal Grain Corporation uses medium-grade HuaBei Baoding wheat as the standard. Each 100 catties of wheat can produce 81.01 catties of Tongfen, 8.78 catties of small bran, and 10.16 catties of large bran (small and large bran can also be milled into another 2 to 3 catties of dark flour). Compared to Temple of Heaven flour (76.5 catties from 100 catties of wheat), it yields 4.5 catties more flour. If we calculate based on the current monthly flour production of 400,000 bags in Beijing, producing standard flour instead of Temple of Heaven flour can save 1.7 million catties of wheat, producing more than 32,000 additional bags of standard flour. This can save the country a significant amount of grain. Although this standard flour has more bran specks, the gluten content (the main component being protein) is 1 to 2 percent higher than that of Temple of Heaven flour. Quality testing shows a moisture content of 14.5 percent, protein content of 11.33 percent, ash content of 1.04 percent, fat content of 1.68 percent, crude fiber content of 1.02 percent, and carbohydrate content of 70.43 percent. The nutritional value is also higher, which is beneficial to health. The Beijing Municipal Grain Corporation, in response to the government's call and to meet the needs of the citizens, has already begun mass production of this flour ("Beijing Tongfen") and will officially begin selling it on the market today. Regarding the manufacturing standards for 92 rice, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce has also instructed the Beijing Municipal Grain Corporation to study it, and it will also be announced soon.

[Our Dispatch] Samples of Beijing's August 1st standard flour have already been produced, and a large quantity of products can continuously supply the needs of the citizens. According to Manager Sun and Technician Su of Dejuyong Flour Mill, which is responsible for processing the first batch of August 1st flour: Changing to milling August 1st flour can not only reduce waste and increase production, but also simplify the procedure compared to milling refined flour; simply replacing the sifting silk is enough. Because August 1st flour does not need to be bleached, it can also save 20 degrees of electricity per day compared to milling refined flour, saving electricity costs equivalent to 600 catties of millet per month.

The public-owned (including those produced by government agencies) flour mills in Beijing such as Xinjian, Zhenhua, Xinzhong, Xinxin, and Sanxing, except for Sanxing which has already converted to milling August 1st standard flour, are all prepared and ready to begin milling after the August 1st flour standard samples are sent by the Grain Corporation.

　　“北京通粉”定为标准面
    十五日起全市停制超过标准面粉
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府根据政务院关于改变粮食加工标准，增加食用粮食的决定，前曾责成京市粮食分公司研究八一面的制造标准，已获成果，顷特规定以该公司所制“北京通粉”为京市标准八一面粉，自后（十五）日起，凡本市一切公、私营面粉工厂（包括加工工厂及作坊）应一律停止制造或加工超过该项标准的面粉（低者不限），以减少浪费，增加口粮，提高营养。否则，一经查出，即按情节轻重，分别予以处分。至于本市厂商现存超过标准的面粉，仍准予登记发售，公营厂商到粮食交易所，私营厂商到各该行业公会，摊贩则到各摊贩市场管理处，分别于本月二十日以前申报登记，逾期不报，即不准出售。至于外运面粉来京者，则须持有当地有关机关的证明，到商业局申报批准，方得行销市面。京市粮食分公司所制北京通粉系以华北保定中等花小麦为标准，每百斤小麦可磨制通粉八十一点零一斤，小麸皮八点七八斤，大麸皮十点一六斤（大小麸皮尚可另外磨制二斤到三斤黑面）；比天坛粉（百斤小麦制七十六点五斤）可多出四点五斤面粉，如以现在京市每月生产面粉四十万袋计算，则制标准粉比制天坛粉可节省小麦一百七十万斤，可多产标准粉三万二千余袋。这便可给国家节省一笔粮食。此种标准粉虽麸星较多，但面筋质（主要成份系蛋白质）较天坛粉高百分之一到二，其品质经鉴定，含水量百分之十四点五，蛋白质百分之十一点三三，灰份一点零四，脂肪一点六八，粗纤维一点零二，碳水化合物七十点四三。营养价值也较高，有益身体的健康。京市粮食公司为响应政府号召，适应市民需要，现已大量生产该种面粉（北京通粉），并自今日起正式在市上发售。至于九二米之制造标准，京市商业局亦已责成京市粮食分公司研究，不日亦将公布。
    【本报讯】京市八一面标准粉样业已制出，大量产品即可源源供应市民需要。据担任首批八一粉加工的德聚涌粉厂孙经理和苏技师谈：改磨八一粉不但能减少浪费，增加产量；同时由磨制精粉改磨八一粉手续简单，只要更换筛绢就行了。因八一粉不需经过漂白，较磨制精粉每日还可以节电二十度，一个月可省合小米六百斤的电费。
    京市新建、振华、新中、新新、三星等公营（包括有机关生产）粉厂，除三星已改磨八一标准粉外，其他各厂亦均准备妥当，待粮食公司八一粉标准样发到后，即可开始磨制。（宇）
