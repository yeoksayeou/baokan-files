　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd—According to Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party Diet members Shiga Yoshio and others met with Cabinet Secretary-General Masuda Kokaichi on March 28th to protest the Yoshida government's reactionary measure of "forced mediation" of the coal miners' strike.

　　After the Central Struggle Committee of the Japan Coal Miners' Union Federation, under pressure from MacArthur and the Yoshida government, issued an instruction to cease the strike on March 28th, it issued a statement on the matter, stating: The Yoshida government does not fundamentally address the strike issue, but attempts to unilaterally deny the workers' basic right—the right to strike. We have judged the various situations and ordered the cessation of the nationwide strike from the 29th, but the responsibility of the Yoshida government will be pursued to the end. We have not abandoned the demand for a resolute wage increase, and we will continue to fight against the brutality and unreasonableness of the Yoshida government and the capitalists.

　　日共抗议吉田政府镇压煤矿罢工
    【新华社二日讯】据共同社东京讯：日本共产党国会议员志贺义雄等于三月二十八日会见内阁书记长增田甲子七时，对吉田政府“强制调解”煤矿工人罢工的反动措施，提出抗议。
    日本煤矿工人工会联合会中央斗争委员会在麦克阿瑟和吉田政府的压力下，于三月二十八日发出停止罢工的指令后，即就此事发表声明称：吉田政府不从根本上着手解决罢工问题，却企图片面地否认工人的基本权利——罢工权。我们判断各种形势而下令自二十九日起停止全国性罢工，但对吉田政府的责任，将追究到底。我们没有放弃坚决提高工资的要求，仍要继续向吉田政府和资本家的残暴与无理作斗争。
