　　Who Lost Three Letters?
    The person who lost the letters is requested to come to this newspaper to collect them as soon as possible. They should seriously examine their negligence.
    Yesterday afternoon, Xing Deshun, a tricycle worker from No. 3 Beikoudai Hutong, rushed to the police station with three letters and said, "I found three letters on West Chang'an Street. There may be very important things inside. Please comrades, quickly announce that they have been found!" We took a look and saw that one letter was addressed to Minister Li of the Central United Front Work Department, another to Director Lin of the International Trade Department of the Central Ministry of Trade, and the third to Mr. Xiao Xinzhi of the China Democratic National Construction Association. We believe that the actions of tricycle worker Xing Deshun are worthy of learning, while the letter-loser's negligence and irresponsibility should be seriously examined.
                                              (Internal Branch No. 1 of the Public Security Bureau)
    Editor's Note: These three letters are kept in the People's Garden section of this newspaper. We hope the person who lost the letters will come to collect them as soon as possible.

　　谁丢了三封信？
    望丢信人速来本报领取  要好好检讨自己的疏忽
    昨日下午，有管界北口袋胡同三号三轮工人邢德顺拿着三封信匆匆地跑到派出所说：“我在西长安街拾到三封信，里面说不定有很重要的事，请同志们快给招领一下吧！”我们一看，一封是写给中央统战部李部长，另一封是给中央贸易部国际贸易司林司长，第三封是给民主建国会萧新之先生的。我们认为三轮工人邢德顺这一举动值得学习，而丢信人这样疏忽，不负责任，应该好好检讨。
                                              （公安局内一分局）
    编者按：这三封信存本报人民园地组，希望丢信的人快来领取。
