　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th. Since the joint anti-epidemic team, composed of the Health Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, the Health Department of the Guangdong Military Region, and the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team, launched anti-epidemic work in the plague area of the Leizhou Peninsula, it has achieved good results. After arriving in the epidemic area on February 23rd, the team was divided into two squads to work in the countryside. In the Lianjiang and Suixi areas, the anti-epidemic squad, in cooperation with the local people's government, went deep into 71 villages in the epidemic area to conduct examinations, injections, disinfection, treatment, rat and flea extermination, and epidemiological investigations. They also established an isolation hospital and organized an epidemic reporting preparatory meeting. An anti-epidemic branch was established in Anpu Town, Lianjiang County, absorbing local Chinese and Western medicine doctors to participate; an anti-epidemic team was set up in each township, and anti-epidemic team members were dispatched to each village; one villager was selected for every ten households to be responsible for reporting and sending plague patients to the hospital upon discovery, and dead rats were to be sent to the anti-epidemic team for research. In addition, the anti-epidemic team thoroughly disinfected families with dead rats. Since the arrival of the anti-epidemic team, of the 27 plague patients in the area, except for three who died on the way to the hospital due to late discovery, all the others have been admitted to the hospital for treatment. Eight people have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, and the rest are still under treatment.
　　In its work on the Leizhou Peninsula, the anti-epidemic team first overcame the difficulty of language barriers. The anti-epidemic team members used blackboards, slogans, cartoons, and other means to carry out publicity and education work among the masses. Secondly, they demonstrated a high degree of initiative in conducting examinations, injections, and treatment in the epidemic area. After the discovery of plague in Xia Kong Village, the Fourth District of Lianjiang, the anti-epidemic team rushed to the scene in time, carried the patient to the hospital, and personally cleaned and disinfected the patient's home and the homes of his neighbors, which deeply moved the residents. After the patient recovered, he often visited the anti-epidemic team to express his gratitude. Some people, seeing that the anti-epidemic team lacked vegetables, automatically sent them green vegetables.

　　雷州半岛鼠疫区内防治工作深入乡村
    【新华社广州十二日电】广东省人民政府卫生厅、广东军区卫生部和东北防疫队联合组成的防疫大队，在雷州半岛鼠疫区内展开防疫工作以来，已获得良好成绩。该大队于二月二十三日到达疫区后，即分为两个中队下乡工作。在廉江、遂溪一带的防疫中队，配合当地人民政府深入疫区七十一个村庄，进行检诊、注射、消毒、治疗、捕鼠灭蚤和疫情调查研究等工作；并设立隔离病院一所，组织了疫情报告筹备会。廉江县安铺镇设立防疫分会，吸收当地中西医师参加；每乡设一防疫小组，每村派防疫组员；每十户选一村民，负责于发现鼠疫病人时报告送院，发现死鼠须送防疫队研究。此外，防疫队对有死鼠的家庭进行彻底消毒。该地区自防疫队到达后，鼠疫患者二十七人中，除三人因发现过晚于抬送医院途中死亡外，其余均已入院治疗。现已有八人先后病愈出院，其余都在医治中。
    防疫队在雷州半岛的工作中，首先克服了语言不通的困难。防疫队员运用黑板报、标语、漫画等，向群众进行了宣传教育工作。其次，他们发挥了高度的积极性，在疫区进行检诊、注射和治疗工作。廉江四区下空村发现了鼠疫后，防疫队闻讯及时赶到，将病人抬往医院，并亲自动手在病人的家里及其左右邻居打扫清洁，进行消毒，居民都深受感动。病人恢复健康以后常至防疫队探望问好。有些群众看到防疫队缺菜吃，就自动送青菜。
