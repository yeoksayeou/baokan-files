To the Editor:

　　The railway bureau is now implementing a planned system for freight transport. I want to change the arrival station for the goods I consigned. Is this possible?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wei Min

Mr. Wei Min:

　　Your question has been answered by the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government as follows:

　　1. A change to the transportation plan means that after the shipper submits a transportation plan and the railway agrees to implement it, the shipper wants to change the original plan. The shipper can request the railway bureau that proposed the plan (if originally submitted through the departure station, it should still be submitted through the departure station) to change the plan. The railway bureau may allow the change if it believes that it will not affect the overall transportation plan based on the transportation situation.

　　2. A change to freight transportation means that the shipper wants to change the consigned goods (regardless of whether a transportation plan has been submitted in advance) after the railway has accepted them. The shipper can request the departure station or the arrival station of the goods. Changes may be permitted, except when changes cannot be implemented due to natural disasters or other unavoidable reasons, or when changes hinder the transportation of other goods, or when the consignee at the arrival station has already requested delivery of the goods.

　　若要变更货运到达站  发货人可向路局申请编辑同志：
    现在铁路局方面对于货物运输实行计划制，我所托运的货物希望变更到达站，不知可能否？
                                                        魏民魏民君：
    你的问题已由中央人民政府铁道部运输总局答复如下：
    一、运输计划的变更，就是发货人提出运输计划经铁路同意照这计划执行以后，而欲变更原计划，发货人到站时可以向提出计划的铁路局（原来经由发站提出者仍经由发站）请求变更计划。铁路局根据运输情况，如认为不至因此而影响了整个运输计划，可以允许变更。
    二、货物运输的变更，就是发货人托运的货物（无认事先已否提出运输计划），经铁路承运以后而欲变更。发货人到站时可以向货物的发站或到站请求。除了因天灾事变及其他不得已事由不能实行变更、或因变更而妨害了其他货物运送、又或货物到达到站收货人已请求交货时以外，可以允许变更。
