Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 6th: The Yellow River peach blossom flood has begun, and the river water has been visibly rising in recent days. The Yellow River's peach blossom flood occurs around the time of the Qingming Festival each year, caused by the melting snow in the upper reaches and frequent spring rains. According to a report from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's Shanzhou Hydrological Station, at 12:00 on the 2nd of this month, the water level at Shanzhou was 292.12 meters, and the river flow was 1200 cubic meters per second; by 17:00 on the same day, the water level had increased to 293.29 meters, and the flow had suddenly increased to 2400 cubic meters per second.

　　黄河桃汛开始
    黄委会电各地防范
    【新华社开封六日电】黄河桃汛开始，近日河水日见增涨。黄河的桃汛发生在每年的清明节前后，是因为上游各地积雪融化，加以春雨频繁所造成。据黄河水利委员会陕州水文站报告，本月二日十二时陕州水位为二九二点一二公尺，河水流量为一二○○秒公方；至同日十七时，水位即增高为二九三点二九公尺，流量则突增至二四○○秒公方。黄委会现已分电平原、山东等省河务局，注意防范。
