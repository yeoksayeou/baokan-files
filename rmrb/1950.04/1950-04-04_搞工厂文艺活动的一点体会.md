　　Some Experiences in Organizing Factory Cultural Activities
    Xiao Wu
    This time, I responded to the call of the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles to go to factories to engage in cultural and recreational activities and was assigned to the Fourth Clothing Factory. When I first came to the factory, I encountered many difficulties. A professor from Jinling Women's University said after coming to the factory: "Although I am a 'learned' person in the lecture hall, I feel exceptionally empty in front of the workers." Indeed, all comrades who have worked in factories have the same feeling.

    In these two weeks of working in the factory, I have gained the following insights:

    (1) To get close to the workers, we must share their joys and sorrows, live with them, and understand their needs from their actual lives, and solve problems for them in a down-to-earth manner, so as to achieve mutual understanding and trust. In particular, it is necessary to understand the factory situation in advance, learn production knowledge, worker characteristics, and worker needs. At the same time, we must establish close working relationships with the trade union and the responsible organizations within the factory and humbly accept their guidance and assistance.

    (2) To serve the workers, we must be patient, confident, and humble. Inspire and cultivate activists, and promote cultural and recreational activities through activists; but pay attention not to detach from the masses, and strive to take care of everyone. We must actively contact them and respect their opinions. We should not be guests or teachers of the workers, but first be students of the workers and friends of the workers.

    (3) What workers like are things that are full of vitality. For example, when doing wall newspapers, the content needs to be short, popular, lively, and the characters should be large. Also, work that is relatively easy to promote includes singing, yangko dancing, and quick talks. At present, the popularization of cultural and artistic work in factories is more important than improvement. We must start from small things and avoid staging large dramas as much as possible. At the same time, do not let our work hinder their production. Because although workers are happy to be close to us, they value production more, and the direct purpose of carrying out factory cultural activities is to improve production.

　　搞工厂文艺活动的一点体会
    萧吾
    这次我响应了南京文联到工厂去搞文娱活动的号召，被分配到第四被服厂。初下工厂，碰到不少困难，一位金陵女大的教授下厂后，她这样说：“在讲堂上虽然是个‘饱学’之士，可是在工人面前感到异常空虚。”的确，凡是下厂工作过的同志，都有如是的感觉。
    在这两周的下厂工作中，我得到以下一些心得：
    （一）我们和工人接近，必须和工人同志们共甘苦、同宿食，从实际生活中去体会他们的需要，替他们脚踏实地的解决问题，才能取得相互了解和信任。尤其是事先要了解工厂情况，学习生产知识、工人特性、工人需要。同时，要和工会和厂内负责机构取得工作上的密切联系，虚心接受他们的指导和协助。
    （二）为工人们服务，要有耐性，有信心，要虚心。启发和培养积极分子，通过积极分子来推展文娱活动；但要注意不脱离群众，要做到普遍照顾。我们要主动的去联系他们，并且多尊重他们的意见。我们不要做工人的客人或老师，而先要做工人的学生，做工人的朋友。
    （三）工人们喜欢的都是生命力活跃的东西。譬得搞墙报，内容就需要简短通俗、生动活泼、字要大。还有，比较易于推动的工作是歌咏秧歌快板等。目前工厂的文艺工作，普及比提高更重要，我们要从小处着手，最好避免排大戏。同时不要因我们的工作而妨碍他们的生产。因为工人们虽然欢喜和我们接近，但他们是更重视生产的，而开展工厂文艺活动直接的目的，也就是为了搞好生产。
