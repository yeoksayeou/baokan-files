　　New Stage of the Movement to Defend World Peace
　　From Stockholm Return (Part 1, Continued)
　　Xiao San

　　To answer the meeting of the military leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty countries in The Hague, the people of the Netherlands held demonstrations and submitted letters of protest to the U.S. Embassy in the Netherlands and the Dutch government. The slogan of the demonstrators was: "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty!"
　　The people of the Netherlands approved the resolutions of Stockholm and the Standing Committee. Workers in Limburg sympathized with the actions of the dockworkers and donated money to help them. Father Streeder of the city of Chai Adamm gave speeches in churches, promoting peace, paying tribute to the dockworkers, opposing the military conference of aggressor nations held in The Hague, criticizing the United States' policy in Asia, and accusing American capitalists of suppressing national liberation movements and helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
　　On April 1st, the people of the Netherlands held a large-scale demonstration in The Hague. Peace representatives were sent from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Groningen, Chai Adamm and other places to participate. The Hague and Committee issued a call: "Today, the whole of The Hague echoes with the cry: Down with weapons, down with the atomic bomb, no more war! Long live peace, peace, peace! Residents of The Hague, express your desire for peace!" Balendrecht, chairman of the Rotterdam Dockworkers Committee, took the stage and said: "Today we declare to the warmongers who have gathered in The Hague to formulate military plans that we dockworkers in Rotterdam will never unload American weapons of murder." Blockzyl, chairman of the Dutch Trade Union Federation, said: "The people of the Netherlands are willing to have solid friendship with the Soviet Union, New China, and all democratic countries. We will never forget the great contribution of the Soviet people to the cause of peace, defeating German fascism, as a result of which the Netherlands was also liberated. We will never forget the heroic miracle of the Soviet people in Stalingrad. It broke the back of fascism and saved mankind. Therefore, we declare today that we are friends of the Soviet Union and firmly fight with it against those who attempt to start a new war."
　　Finland, April 2nd, marked the second anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union. The Helsinki organization of the Finnish People's Democratic League convened a meeting of more than 8,000 people, condemning the reactionary Finnish government (the agent of Finnish and Swedish bank capital in the hands of Anglo-American imperialism) for not fully implementing this treaty, causing losses to the country and the people. The slogan of the meeting was: Support peace, support democracy, be friendly with the Soviet Union! The meeting resolved: We will never allow war against the Soviet Union.
　　The people of Denmark are carrying out a movement to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty.
　　There are more than 20 organizations striving for peace in Norway. The Oslo Peace Congress concluded on March 26th. Norwegian economist Moltensen gave a report, pointing out that the Norwegian so-called National Defense Committee's national militarization plan would further reduce the living standards of the Norwegian people by 15 percent. He called on the Norwegian people to resist this policy that complies with the demands of the Anglo-American warmongers. The conference elected a 27-member Norwegian Peace Committee. The conference issued a declaration, accusing the Norwegian government of openly joining the war camp and suppressing the peace movement. But the power of peace is increasing day by day. The Norwegian people support the decisions of the Third Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace. We unite and fight together to stop war and guarantee peace, for ourselves and our children... After the conference, a mass meeting was held, and members of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, Bishop Boulier (France), writer Lockwood (Australia), and Bulsari (Brazil) delivered speeches.
　　Scandinavian countries organized a relay race to pass on the appeal for peace.
　　In the United States, 1,500 physicists demanded that Truman pursue a different policy.
　　The committee established at the National Labor Union Representatives Conference in Chicago, USA, is collecting signatures on an appeal to Truman demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons.
　　Canada is preparing to hold a National Peace Congress. At the same time, it is collecting 200,000 signatures for the appeal.
　　British peace fighters travel by truck to promote peace throughout the country. Peace committees are being established in various districts of London. A newspaper asked famous social activists how to prevent the use of atomic weapons, and received many answers, all advocating banning atomic weapons, changing foreign policy, and supporting the Soviet Union's proposals in the United Nations - disarmament...
　　On March 27th, a conference initiated by the bourgeois pacifist organization "Peace Pledge Union" in London condemned British war preparations. Pacifist female writer Vera Brittain, Member of Parliament Rhys Davies, and Aneurin Bevan spoke. Bevan spoke about the heavy losses of war expenses to the British people. He said that Britain spends 800 million pounds a year on military expenses. He cited an example that a family of seven living in two damp small houses has to bear two pounds of military expenses per week per person. If they don't have to bear this burden, they can build a very good house.
　　The trade union in Heilbronn, West Germany, with 3,000 construction workers, declared that it would join the Peace Fighters Committee.
　　In Asia, China's victory is a powerful guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. The establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are both gospels of peace. Recently, peace committees have been organized in various parts of North Korea, and the movement has developed more widely. Under the rule of the US military, the Japanese people have also organized peace committees with millions of members.
　　India held a National Peace Congress last November. Their slogans are: "Absolutely no fighting against the Soviet Union!" "Absolutely not being slaves of the United States!" "Never transport weapons to kill the people of Burma and Malaya!"
　　At the end of March this year, India held a "Peace Struggle Week". The Indian newspaper "Crossroads" published the All-India Trade Union Congress's declaration to Indian workers, which said: "The All-India Trade Union Congress Committee calls on all trade union organizations to establish peace committees in every enterprise, institution, and workers' district to continuously expose the war plans of the imperialist countries and their accomplices." The committee calls on trade union organizations to collect signatures on the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. "The Executive Committee calls on the working class to make a solemn oath that the workers will resolutely fight against dragging India into a war against the Soviet Union, democratic countries and the People's Republic of China, and the working class will always stand on the side of the Soviet Union - the first country where socialism triumphed." The Executive Committee fully supports the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal to the parliaments of all countries and requires the Indian government to support the Standing Committee's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly.
　　In Pakistan, due to the initiative of progressive writers, a Peace Congress was held in Akala City (West Pakistan) from April 13th to 14th, with workers, farmers, and progressive student groups participating in the meeting.
　　All the calls of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace have received warm support from the people of all countries, because they are in line with the interests and demands of all people.
　　This time, the decision of the Third Standing Committee meeting on continuing to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons will surely receive a very wide response. All conscientious and just people will sign this declaration - appeal. The signature campaign is now being widely launched in various countries. Exposing the masks of the instigators of aggressive war, expanding and consolidating our ranks, the peace movement can accomplish its historical task: preventing and stopping the resurgence of war, mobilizing the power of the broad masses to oppose the imperialist aggressive forces. Such a large force of the masses can suppress any aggressor.
　　"Now we have entered an era where all honest and well-meaning people unite and take action, and can truly stop the terrible war and preserve world peace" (General idea of ​​Fadeev's speech at the Stockholm mass meeting).
　　Many warriors have been united in this team defending peace. We must rely on the support of international democratic organizations of workers, women, and youth, rely on the promotion of all progressive cultural, scientific, artistic, social, and religious figures, and unite more and more people from various countries to fight for lasting peace and universal security in the world.
　　China's advanced and progressive people who love peace and freedom, and the entire people, will never lag behind others in this international central activity of the democratic and progressive mankind of the world!

　　保卫世界和平运动的新阶段
    从斯德哥尔摩归来之一（下）
    萧三
    荷兰的人民为了回答北大西洋公约各国军事领袖在海牙的会议，举行示威，向驻荷美国使馆及荷兰政府递书抗议。示威群众的口号是：“打倒北大西洋公约！”
    荷兰的人民赞成斯德哥尔摩和大常委会的决议。林堡的工人同情码头工人的举动，捐钱帮助他们。柴阿丹姆城的神父斯特来德在教堂里演讲，宣传和平，向码头工人致敬，反对在海牙开的侵略国军事会议，批评美国在亚洲的政策，指责美国资本家镇压民族解放运动，帮助蒋介石匪帮。
    荷兰人民于四月一日在海牙举行声势浩大的示威。从阿姆斯特坦姆、洛特丹姆、格洛能庚、柴阿丹姆等地派了和平代表来参加。海牙和委发出号召：“今天全海牙响着呼声：打倒武器，打倒原子弹，不要任何战争！万岁和平，和平，和平！海牙居民们，表示自己对和平的愿望吧！”洛特丹姆码头委员会主席巴伦德列赫特登台演说：“今天我们向在海牙集合制订军事计划的战争贩子宣言，我们洛特丹姆的码头工人决不卸运杀人的美国武器。”荷兰职工会主席布洛克才尔说：“荷兰的人民愿意和苏联，和新中国及一切民主国家有巩固的友谊。我们永不忘记苏联人民在和平事业中的伟大贡献，打倒德国法西斯主义，结果荷兰也得到解放。我们永不忘记苏联人民在斯大林格勒的英雄主义奇迹。他打断了法西斯主义的脊骨，挽救了人类。因此我们今天宣布，我们是苏联的朋友并坚决和他一道为反对企图掀起新战争者而斗争。”
    芬兰，四月二日为订立芬苏友好合作互助条约两周年。芬兰人民民主同盟赫尔新基的组织召集了八千多人的大会，谴责芬兰反动现政府（英美帝国主义手中的芬兰瑞典银行资本代理人）没有完全执行这一条约，招致国家与人民的损失，大会的口号是：拥护和平，拥护民主，与苏联友好！大会决议说：我们永远不让对苏联发动战争。
    丹麦的人民进行着退出北大西洋公约的运动。
    挪威已有二十多个争取和平的组织。三月二十六日完结了在奥斯陆举行的拥护和平大会。挪威经济学家莫尔縢生作了报告，指出挪威所谓的大国防委员会的国家军事化计划，将使得挪威人民的生活水平再降低百分之十五。他号召挪威人民为反抗顺从英美战争贩子的要求的这种政策。大会选出二十七人组成的挪威拥护和平委员会。大会发出宣言，指责挪威政府公开加入战争阵营，压迫和平运动。但和平的力量是日益增加的。挪威人民拥护世界保卫和平大会常委会第三次会议的决定。我们团结一致，共同奋斗，就能制止战争，保障和平，为了我们自己和我们的孩子……大会之后举行了群众大会，世界拥护和平大会常委会委员，主教蒲里耶（法），作家罗克伍德（澳）及波尔萨里（巴西）都发表了演说。
    斯堪的那维亚国家组织了传递和平呼吁的接力跑。
    在美国有一千五百个物理学家要求杜鲁门奉行另一种政策。
    美国芝加哥全美工会代表会议上成立的委员会，正在为致杜鲁门要求禁止使用原子武器的呼吁书上收集签名。
    加拿大正在准备开全加拥护和平大会。同时为呼吁书收集二十万个签名。
    英国的和平战士乘卡车到全国各地去宣扬和平。在伦敦的各区建立保卫和平委员会。一个报纸向有名的社会活动家提问题，如何预防使用原子武器，得到许多回答，都主张禁止原子武器，改变外交政策，赞成苏联在联合国的提议——缩减军备……
    三月二十七日伦敦资产阶级的和平主义者组织“争取和平同盟”发起的大会，谴责英国备战。和平主义者女作家维拉·布列登，国会议员里思·戴维斯，埃姆利斯·休士等演说。休士说到战费对英国人民的重大损失。他说英国每年要耗费八万万英镑作军费。他举例说，一个七口之家住在两间潮湿的小房子里，每人每周要担负两英镑的军费，假如不要负担这个，可以建筑一所很好的住宅。
    西德海尔布龙拥有三千建筑工人的工会，声明加入和平战士委员会。
    在亚洲，中国的胜利就是远东以及世界和平有力的保障。北朝鲜人民民主共和国的成立，越南民主共和国的成立都是和平的福音。最近北朝鲜各地都组织了保卫和平委员会，和运是更广泛地发展了。日本人民在美军统治之下，也组织了保卫和平委员会，会员有好几百万人。
    去年十一月印度开过全国保卫和平大会。他们的口号是：“绝对不对苏联作战！”“绝对不作美国的奴隶！”“永远不运武器去杀缅甸和马来亚的人民！”
    今年三月末全印度举行“和平斗争周”。印度报纸《克罗斯劳兹》登载全印职工大会向印度劳动者的宣言，里面说：“全印工会大会委员会号召一切工会组织，在每个企业、机关、工人区内建立拥护和平委员会，不断地揭露帝国主义国家及其助手的战争计划”。委员会号召工会组织收集在拥护世界和平大会常委会议的决议上的签名。“执委号召工人阶级作庄严的宣誓，工人坚决地为反对把印度拖入反苏联、各民主国家和中华人民共和国的战争而斗争，工人阶级永远站在苏联——这个第一个社会主义胜利的国家一边”。执委完全支持世界和平大会常委会对各国议会的呼吁，要求印度政府在联合国大会支持常委的提议。
    在巴基斯坦，由于进步作家们的发起，四月十三——十四在阿卡拉城（巴基斯坦西部）召开拥护和平大会，工人、农民及进步学生团体参加会议。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的一切号召，都得到各国人民热烈的支持，因为那是符合于一切人民的利益和要求的。
    这次，第三次常委会议关于继续为禁止原子武器而斗争的决定，一定能够得到非常广泛的响应。一切有良心的、正义的人们都将在这个宣言——呼吁书上签名。现在签名的运动正在各国广泛地展开着。揭露侵略战争挑拨者的假面具，扩大、巩固自己的队伍，和平运动就能完成其历史任务：妨碍、阻止战争之再起，动员广大民众的力量来反对帝国主义侵略势力，这样大的民众力量是能够镇压住任何侵略者的。
    “现在已进入了这样的时代，即一切正直的好心的人们团结起来，行动起来，就真正能制止可怕的战争，保住世界和平”（法捷耶夫在斯德哥尔摩群众大会上演说的大意）。
    在保卫和平的这个队伍里已经团结了不少的战士。我们要倚靠工人、妇女、青年的国际民主组织的支持，倚靠一切进步文化界、科学界、艺术界、社会团体与宗教团体人士的推动，团结各国更多更多的人，为全世界的持久和平与普遍安全而斗争。
    中国爱好和平、爱好自由的先进进步人士和全体人民，在这个全世界民主进步人类的国际中心活动中，决不落在他人的后面！
