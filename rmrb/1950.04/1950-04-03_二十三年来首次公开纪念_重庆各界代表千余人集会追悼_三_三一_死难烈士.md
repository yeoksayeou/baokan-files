　　First Public Commemoration in Twenty-Three Years
　　Over a Thousand Representatives from All Circles in Chongqing Gather to Commemorate the "March 31st" Martyrs
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] People from all circles in Chongqing gathered on the 31st of last month to commemorate the martyrs who died in the city's "March 31st" incident twenty-three years ago, and the revolutionary martyrs who were killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation since then. More than a thousand representatives from various agencies, democratic parties, and people's organizations attended. At the meeting, Zhang Jichun, Director of the Chongqing Military Control Commission, and Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal People's Government, spoke successively. Director Zhang Jichun pointed out that the "March 31st" massacre in Chongqing was part of the overall conspiracy of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, represented by the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, to betray the people and launch a large-scale massacre. It was a bloody crime of the Kuomintang bandit gang, similar to the "April 12th" incident. However, since then, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have continued to wage a long and arduous struggle, and finally overcome the obstruction of the reactionaries and achieved victory. He called on everyone to continue the revolution to the end and fully complete the unfinished cause of the martyrs. Subsequently, Mr. Li Xiaoting, an old man who participated in the Great Revolution, and representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations spoke successively, unanimously expressing their firm support for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and commemorating the dead martyrs with practical actions to complete the revolution. Finally, family members of the martyrs spoke. On the same day, the city's newspapers published special editions and editorials on the matter.
　　Note: On March 31, 1927, the people of Chongqing held a demonstration to protest the shelling of Nanjing by British and American warships on March 24 of the same year, which killed and injured more than 1,000 peaceful residents. The participants in the demonstration included workers, farmers from the suburbs, students, and patriotic people from other walks of life, totaling more than 10,000 people. On that day, the Sichuan local warlords of the Kuomintang ordered the massacre of the demonstrating masses, killing four to five hundred people on the spot and injuring more than a thousand. Among the dead martyrs, those whose names and historical facts have been verified include Liu Jianyu (號願安), an alternate member of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yang Angong, one of the founders of the Sichuan Provincial Communist Party organization, and scholar Qi Shufen, totaling 176 people. Wang Lingji, the war criminal who was recently captured, was the executioner of this massacre. Since the massacre, the people of the city have been able to hold a solemn commemoration meeting publicly for the first time.

　　二十三年来首次公开纪念
    重庆各界代表千余人集会追悼“三·三一”死难烈士
    【新华社重庆二日电】重庆各界人民于上月三十一日集会追悼二十三年前该市“三、三一”死难烈士及自那时以后在抗日战争、解放战争时期被国民党反动派杀害的革命烈士。到各机关、各民主党派、各人民团体代表共一千余人。会上，重庆市军管会主任张际春、市人民政府副市长曹荻秋相继讲话。张际春主任指出，重庆“三、三一”惨案是以蒋介石匪首为代表的大地主、大资产阶级背叛人民发动大屠杀的总阴谋的一部分，与“四、一二”事件同为国民党匪帮的血腥罪行。但是，自那时以来，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，继续进行了长期艰苦斗争，终于击破了反动派的阻挠，获得了胜利。他号召大家继续将革命进行到底，全部完成烈士们的未竟事业。接着，曾参加大革命运动的李筱亭老先生、各民主党派和各人民团体的代表先后讲话，一致表示坚决拥护中国共产党的领导，以完成革命的实际行动来纪念死难烈士。最后由烈士家属讲话。同日，该市各报均出特刊，并为此发表社论。
    按：一九二七年三月三十一日重庆市人民曾举行示威大会，抗议同年三月二十四日英、美两国政府的军舰炮轰南京并杀伤和平居民一千余人的暴行。参加示威集会的工人、近郊农民、学生及其他各阶层爱国人士共达一万余人。国民党的四川地方军阀当日下令屠杀示威群众，当场打死四、五百人，打伤在千人以上。死难烈士中，现已查明姓名史实者，有中国共产党第六届候补中央委员刘坚予（号愿安）、四川省共产党组织的创始人之一杨暗公、学者漆树芬等一百七十六人。不久前就擒的战犯王陵基就是这一惨案的刽子手。从惨案发生后，直到现在，该市人民才得以第一次公开地举行隆重的纪念大会。
