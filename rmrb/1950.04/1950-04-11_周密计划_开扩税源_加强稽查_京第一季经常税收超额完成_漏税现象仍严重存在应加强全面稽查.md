　　Careful Planning, Expanding Tax Sources, Strengthening Inspection
    Beijing Exceeds First Quarter Regular Tax Revenue Target
    Tax Evasion Still Serious, Comprehensive Inspection Should Be Strengthened
    [From Our Newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Office: Beijing’s regular tax revenue for the first quarter of 1950 (January, February, and March) has been victoriously completed, exceeding the target by 51.2% (based on one-quarter of the annual regular tax revenue target listed in Beijing’s budget for this year). This is a direct result of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau’s emphasis on regular tax revenue, strengthened planning, expanded tax sources, and further development of inspection work over the past three months. Regarding strengthening planning, the various departments of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, focusing on their respective areas, held business meetings around January for accounting, statistics, personnel, commercial tax, stamp tax, goods tax, slaughter tax, and transaction tax. These meetings reviewed last year's work, resolved individual problems existing in the execution of business, and specifically studied and arranged the work for 1950. In terms of expanding tax sources, the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau universally levied grain transaction tax within the city on January 6th. In February and March, based on the new detailed items added by the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax promulgated by the Government Administration Council, the city promptly registered and collected supplementary taxes on existing taxable but untaxed goods. These two measures were not only necessary to balance the burden, but also increased government revenue. For example, transaction taxes on livestock, grain, native cloth, and cotton in the suburbs were levied as early as April of last year, while in the urban area, transaction tax was only levied on livestock starting in October of last year. As for grain, cotton, and native cloth transactions, no transaction tax was levied until the end of last year, creating opportunities for merchants to exploit loopholes to evade taxes. Since the implementation of grain transaction tax in the urban area in January this year (cotton and native cloth in the city are not subject to transaction tax due to small transaction volumes as they are not production areas), the transaction tax revenue in January increased from over 460,000 jin of rice in December last year to over 1 million jin, an increase of approximately 1.4 million jin in three months. As for the supplementary tax collection work on existing goods, statistics at the end of March showed that the amount of supplementary tax paid into the treasury converted to rice has reached over 5.3 million jin (accounting for about one-seventh of the total regular tax revenue for the quarter). In terms of inspection work, the main task in January was to inspect regular revenue sources such as goods tax, liquor tax, and commercial tax. Thanks to the organization of manpower and the careful reliance on the masses, great achievements were made, not only reflected in the figure of 4,151 cases of violations discovered in that month, but more concretely in the significant increase in regular tax revenue in that month. Taking the stamp tax, commercial tax, and liquor tax, which accounted for the top three in last year's regular tax revenue, the stamp tax revenue in January increased from over 1.65 million jin of rice in December last year to over 2.16 million jin; commercial tax increased from over 1.02 million jin to over 1.5 million jin; and liquor tax also increased from over 1.45 million jin to over 1.59 million jin. Due to the tax bureau's adoption of the above three measures, Beijing's regular tax revenue target for the first quarter of 1950 was exceeded. On the other hand, based on the fact that Beijing's regular tax revenue accounted for 62.83% of the total tax revenue last year, the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau formulated a work plan for this year, mainly to strengthen inspection work in order to increase regular tax revenue. However, due to the shortage of cadres (or the allocation is not yet appropriate), tax evasion is still a serious problem, especially reflected in the tax revenue figures for February and March. In February, due to the concentrated efforts to carry out the goods tax supplementary work, most of the cadres of the inspection section of the Municipal Tax Bureau and the inspection divisions of various tax sub-bureaus cooperated in carrying out this work, and the comprehensive inspection work was therefore relaxed. Except for the goods tax, the revenue from various taxes generally declined. For example, the stamp tax revenue in February was nearly 800,000 jin of millet less than in January. In March, the Municipal Tax Bureau and various tax sub-bureaus concentrated their efforts on preparing for the collection of industrial and commercial taxes, and therefore the inspection work on regular tax revenue had not yet recovered. For example, the stamp tax was still short by 600,000 jin of millet.

　　周密计划·开扩税源·加强稽查
    京第一季经常税收超额完成
    漏税现象仍严重存在应加强全面稽查
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市一九五○年第一季度（一、二、三月份）经常税收已超额百分之五十一点二胜利完成（以京市本年度概算所列经常税收任务四分之一为基数）。这是京市税务局在过去三个月中重视经常性税收收入，加强计划性，开扩税源，进一步开展稽查工作的直接结果。在加强计划性方面，京市税务局各科室都曾以业务为主，在一月份前后分别召开了会计、统计、人事、行商、印花、货物、屠宰及交易税等业务会议。检讨去年工作，解决执行业务时存在的个别问题，并具体研究和布置了一九五○年的工作。在开扩税源方面，京市税务局曾于一月六日普遍开征了城内粮食交易税，二、三月份并根据政务院颁布的货物税暂行条例所增加的新细目，及时进行了本市旧存应税未税货物的登记补税工作。这两件工作，不但为平衡负担所必需，同时也增加了政府的收入。如郊区的牲畜、粮食、土布、棉花等交易税早于去年四月即开征，而城区的交易税从去年十月起仅对牲畜开征，至于粮食、棉花、土布交易则直到去年年底都未征收交易税，造成商人钻空子逃税漏税的机会。自今年一月开征城区粮食交易税后（城内棉花、土布因非产区成交量小，不拟开征交易税），一月份交易税收入便从去年十二月收入折米四十六万余斤增到一百余万斤，三个月中增加了约一百四十万斤的收入。至于旧存货物补税工作，于三月底统计，补税纳库折米数字已达五百三十万余斤（占全季经常税收入约七分之一）。在稽查工作方面，一月份以检查货物税、酒税、行商税等经常收入为主要工作，由于组织了力量，且慎重依靠群众的结果，获得很大成绩，这不仅表现在该月份共查获违章案件四千一百五十一起的数字上，更具体表现在该月份经常税收入大大的上升的数字上。拿占去年经常税收入前三位的印花、行商、酒税来看，一月份印花税收入由去年十二月份折米一百六十五万余斤增加到二百十六万余斤；行商税由一百零二万余斤增加到一百五十万余斤；酒税亦由一百四十五万余斤增加到一百五十九万余斤。由于税务局采取了以上三方面措施，京市一九五○年第一季度的经常税收任务乃得超额完成。另一方面，京市税务局根据去年京市经常性税收占全部税收百分之六十二点八三的情况，曾制订本年度工作计划，主要是加强稽查工作，以加强经常性税收收入。但由于干部力量的不足（或配备尚不够十分恰当），因而漏税现象仍严重存在，特别是表现在二、三月份的税收数字上。二月份，由于货物补税工作突击展开，市税务局稽查科及各税务分局稽查课干部大部配合了这一工作的进行，全面稽查工作因之松懈。除货物税外，各税收入普遍下降，如二月份印花税较一月份少收几达八十万斤小米，三月份，市税务局、各税务分局，又集中力量进行工商业税的征收准备工作，因而对经常税收的稽查工作仍未恢复，如印花税即相差仍有六十万斤小米之巨。
