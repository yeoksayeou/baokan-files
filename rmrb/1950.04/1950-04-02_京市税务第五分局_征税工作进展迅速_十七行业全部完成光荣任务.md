Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau Fifth Branch
    Tax Collection Work Proceeds Rapidly
    Seventeen Industries All Complete Glorious Task
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau Fifth Branch, due to appropriately organizing its cadre strength, timely convening mobilization meetings of industrial and commercial households, and combining the investigation of accounts to resolve individual problems that arose during the democratic appraisal process, the collection of the 1949 second half-year industrial and commercial tax progressed extremely rapidly. With the exception of the beef and mutton, kerosene and imported goods, and hospital clinics industries, which are still awaiting city-wide industry appraisal, the payment notices for the 2,727 households in the one hundred and five industries under the jurisdiction of the branch bureau were all issued yesterday (the 1st). Yesterday was the first day for payment, and the branch bureau's tax revenue reached over 160 million RMB and tax payment in kind of over 40,000 jin of rice. The cattle boiler houses, pig and sheep intestines, and other seventeen industries under the jurisdiction of the branch bureau have all gloriously completed their tax payment tasks.
    During the previous collection of the first half of last year's industrial and commercial tax, the Fifth Branch of the Tax Bureau completed the tax collection task in eight days, and was commended by the Municipal Tax Bureau. Several model industries, groups, and merchants were also awarded banners and certificates. After the preparatory work for the current collection of industrial and commercial tax began, the Tax Branch Bureau immediately organized its forces, transferring twenty-six people from the fifty-four working cadres in the bureau to form five groups, four of which were responsible for mastering the work of appraising and adjusting the scores of all one hundred and eight industries under the jurisdiction of the bureau, and the other group was dedicated to collecting, compiling, and reporting work. Mastering the appraisal work was carried out in a warm atmosphere of "challenge." Every day, each group and each cadre paid attention to the "Industry Situation Mastering Table" and "Challenge" bulletin board posted on the wall of the branch bureau, competing to see which industry's score had been appraised and which group's work was the fastest. Everyone was afraid of falling behind. During the democratic appraisal process, because the more than 3,000 industrial and commercial households under the jurisdiction of the branch bureau generally had a relatively clear understanding of the government's tax policy, the process generally went smoothly. The Fifth Branch of the Tax Bureau conducted account investigations for the individual heavy "shouting" potters and coal shops. After discovering false accounts and mastering the actual materials, it proved that the tax share they should bear was not only not heavy, but also lighter than the government's statutory tax rate. Therefore, the appraisal work of these two industries was quickly completed. After the democratic appraisal work of various industries was basically completed, the branch bureau successively held three mobilization meetings on March 29th, 30th, and 31st. At the mobilization meetings, the administrative leaders of several districts and the director of the Tax Branch Bureau personally attended and spoke, further encouraging the patriotic sentiments of industrial and commercial households to pay taxes to the People's Government, and they expressed their willingness to strive for the glorious flags and certificates. You, the group leader of the noodles and food industry in the city, said: I am a sesame seed cake seller with a very small business, but I will never ask the director to reduce my score. In the past, we were bullied, but now the government is ours, and we must pay our taxes quickly. Some industrial and commercial households asked to pay their taxes in advance immediately after the meeting. For example, Wang Zhixue of the pig and sheep intestines industry collected and paid the industry's tax on March 30th. Zhang Cunyu, the group leader of the cigarette industry, collected the tax from eleven households and sent it to the branch bureau yesterday morning before going to work. On the cadre side of the branch bureau, in order to ensure that the national tax revenue is paid into the treasury as soon as possible, they actively negotiated with various industries, groups, and households, hoping that each household would pay taxes as soon as possible. Yesterday, thirty-two industries in the branch bureau guaranteed to complete the tax collection by the 5th. In order to speed up the payment process, the branch bureau has negotiated with the Beijing Municipal People's Bank and sent five cadres to collect taxes on behalf of the branch bureau. At the same time, various industries and groups have adopted collective payment methods.

　　京市税务第五分局
    征税工作进展迅速
    十七行业全部完成光荣任务
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市税务第五分局由于适当组织干部力量，及时召开工商业户动员大会，并结合查账解决了在民主评议过程中发生的个别问题，故此次一九四九年下半年度工商业税的征收工作进展极为迅速。除牛羊肉、煤油洋广、医院诊疗所等三业尚待全市行业评议外，该分局所管一百零五个行业中之二千七百二十七户的缴款通知书已于昨（一）日全部发出。昨日为缴款第一日，该分局纳库税款即达人民券一亿六千余万元及纳税折米券折米四万余斤。该分局所管的牛锅房、猪羊肠等十七行业各户已全部光荣地完成纳税任务。
    上次征收去年上半年工商业税时，税务第五分局在八天内便完成了纳库任务，曾受到市税务局的表扬。若干模范行业、小组、商户等并曾得到奖旗、奖状等奖励。此次征收工商业税准备工作开始后，该税务分局即时组织了力量，自局内工作干部五十四人中调集二十六人组成了五个小组，其中四个组分别掌握该分局所有一百零八个行业评议调整分数的工作，另外一组则专管搜集、整理汇报工作。掌握评议工作是在热烈“挑战”的团结气氛中展开的，每天，每个小组，每个干部都在注意着该分局墙上张贴的“掌握行业情况表”及“挑战”壁报，争着看那个行业的分数已经评完，那一个组的工作做的最快。人人惟恐落后。该分局在民主评议过程中，由于所管的三千多家工商户方面，一般都已比较清楚地认识了政府税收政策，所以进行的一般都很顺利，而个别“叫喊”重的盆窑、煤铺两行业，税务第五分局则对他们进行了查账，在查获了假账、掌握了实际材料之后，证明他们应负担的税分，不但不重，而且轻于政府法定的税率，因而该两业的评议工作，便也很快的完成了。各行业民主评议工作基本上完成后，该分局即于三月二十九、三十、三十一日连续开了三次动员大会，在动员大会上，几个区的行政负责人及该税务分局局长都曾亲自到会讲话，更进一步鼓舞了工商户对人民政府纳税的爱国情绪，纷纷表示要努力争取光荣的奖旗、奖状。城内面粉食品业尤小组长说：我是个卖烧饼的，生意很小，但我绝不向局长要求减分，过去我们受气，现在政府是我们的，我们要赶快纳税。有的工商户刚开完会便要求提前缴纳税款。如猪羊肠业王志学在三月三十日那天便把该业税款收齐缴了。纸烟业一小组长张存玉催齐十一户税款后，在昨日早晨还没上班时便送到该分局。在该分局干部方面为保证国家税收早日纳库，便积极与各行业、各小组、各户进行协商，希望各户早日缴税。昨天该分局已有三十二个行业保证五日以前完成纳库。该分局为使缴款办理迅速，已与北京市人民银行洽妥，派了五个干部在该分局代收税款，同时，各行业、各小组并已采取了集体缴款的办法。
