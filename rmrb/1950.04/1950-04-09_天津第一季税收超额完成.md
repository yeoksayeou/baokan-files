Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th— Tianjin has exceeded its tax revenue target for the first quarter of 1950 (January to March). From January to March, the city's tax revenue increased month by month, with February increasing by 9.98% compared to January, and March increasing by 38.95% compared to February. The total revenue for the entire quarter exceeded the original target by 83.25%. Among the various taxes in the first quarter, only the slaughter tax fell short of the original target due to the reduction of slaughtering in the city, and the license plate tax fell short because only bicycle and tricycle licenses were made. All other taxes exceeded the original targets. This is the initial result of the Tianjin Tax Bureau's strengthening of tax administration and mastering tax sources. For example, the collection of commodity tax is a frequent and heavy task, and it has exceeded the original target by 70.33% in this quarter. The main reason for this achievement lies in the implementation of key collection, focusing on cotton yarn, dyes, cigarettes, flour, and other goods that often account for more than 80% of the total commodity tax revenue, and controlling the tax sources of important goods. In addition, a system of personal responsibility for resident factory tax collectors has been established. Based on the ability of each cadre, they are responsible for the tax collection work of a certain number of factories and workshops. At the same time, resident factory teams are divided according to region to check and grasp the work and study of the resident factory tax collectors. In this way, the Tianjin Tax Bureau completed the arduous task of collecting commodity taxes from more than 4,000 factories and workshops in the city with only more than 490 working cadres.

　　天津第一季税收超额完成
    【新华社天津八日电】天津市已超额完成一九五○年第一季度（一至三月份）税收任务。从一月到三月，该市税收数额逐月上升，计二月份比一月份增加百分之九点九八，三月份比二月份增加百分之三八点九五，全季总收入额较原定数字超过百分之八三点二五。在第一季度的各项税收中，除屠宰税因市内屠宰减少，和使用牌照税因只做了自行车、三轮车的牌照，因而未完成原定任务外，其余各项都已超过原定数字。这是津市税务局加强税政管理和掌握税源后的初步成果。例如，货物税的征收是经常而繁重的工作，在本季度中已超过原定任务百分之七○点三三。其获致成绩的主要原因就是在于实行了重点征收，抓住了经常占全部货物税收入百分之八十以上的棉纱、颜染料、纸烟、面粉等几类货物，控制重要货物的税源；另外又建立了驻厂征收员的个人负责制，根据每个干部的能力，分别负责一定数量的工厂作坊的征税工作，同时并按地区划分若干驻厂小组，以便检查、掌握驻厂征收员的工作和学习。这样，天津市税务局便仅以四百九十多个工作干部的力量，完成了征收全市四千余家厂坊的货物税的艰巨工作。
