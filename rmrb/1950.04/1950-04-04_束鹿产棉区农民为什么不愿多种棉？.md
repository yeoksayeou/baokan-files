Why are Farmers in the Shulu Cotton-Producing Area Unwilling to Plant More Cotton?
    Our reporter, Lu Sheng
    "Sow before Grain Rain (around April 20th), a little late before Grain Full (around May 21st), right on time for the Start of Summer (around May 6th)." This is the experience of farmers in the cotton-producing area of Shulu County regarding the timing of cotton planting. Before the Anti-Japanese War, every year during the spring plowing season, cotton-planting farmers would be busy delivering manure, tilling the land, and preparing cotton seeds to catch the Start of Summer for sowing. But this year, at this time, only some farmers are delivering manure to the fields, and a few are starting to plow. Why is the enthusiasm not as high this year? After learning about the situation in Li Cao and other villages in the Third District of the county, the reporter found that farmers still have some concerns about planting more cotton. Therefore, when district cadres asked farmers how much cotton they were planning to plant, they said verbally, "We will plant more cotton." But in their minds, they were planning to plant just enough to cover their own clothing needs and meet their assigned burdens, and no more. Why are farmers unwilling to plant more cotton? There are several reasons:
    First, some farmers still do not understand the People's Government's cotton planting policy for this year. For example, some farmers asked the reporter: "Is the government still going to call for a large-scale cotton planting this year?"
    Second, because the market price of cotton has recently been lower than the price of grain, some farmers are short-sighted and worry that their food supply will become a problem. So they plan: "Last year, the cotton was not good, and each mu (approx. 1/6 acre) only yielded 100 jin (50kg). At that time, 100 jin of cotton could be exchanged for 2.8 shi (approx. 200 lbs) of rice, which was better than growing grain. This year, 100 jin of cotton can only be exchanged for 2 shi of rice. Adding the cost of labor and fertilizer, it's not as good as growing grain." Therefore, they plan: "First plant enough to eat, and then plant cotton." For example, labor hero Li Fucheng of Li Cao Village, who cultivates a total of ten mu of land, only plans to plant three mu of cotton.
The supply and marketing cooperative holds 2 million jin of cotton seeds, requiring farmers to exchange them for grain, but farmers lack grain and cannot exchange them, so the cotton seeds are still stockpiled there.
    Third, due to the fact that last year's cotton requisition was entirely seed cotton, most farmers are short of cotton seeds this year. For example, Song Village in the Third District has about 47 qing (approx. 770 acres) of land and plans to plant 18 qing (approx. 297 acres) of cotton this year, but currently the entire village only has more than 7,000 jin of seeds, which is half of what is needed, based on the calculation of 8 jin of seeds needed per mu. According to county leaders: the county supply and marketing cooperative holds 2 million jin of cotton seeds, requiring farmers to exchange them for grain. Most farmers cannot exchange them because they lack grain and demand to borrow some first, but this has not been allowed by the supply and marketing cooperative. Some farmers simply do not exchange or plant more. Therefore, very little of these 2 million jin of cotton seeds has been exchanged so far.
    In addition, farmers also have difficulties such as a lack of fertilizer and livestock, and are worried about the occurrence of aphids, etc., but these are not the main reasons. The most important problem is that the county leaders ideologically believe that the cotton planting time is still early, and are only busy leading the transformation of burdens and democratic government construction, neglecting or completely failing to pay attention to leading cotton planting work. Therefore, they neither understand nor plan to understand what problems exist in the current cotton planting work, let alone solve them in a timely manner. If this continues, they will repeat last year's path of low cotton harvests due to untimely sowing (according to last year's information, the special and county cadres did not go to the villages to urge farmers to plant cotton until after the Start of Summer, resulting in very little harvest in the fall).
    The Qingming Festival (Tomb Sweeping Day) is approaching, and Grain Rain and Start of Summer will follow. We must immediately seize the opportunity to lead farmers in making all preparations for cotton planting, and we can no longer hesitate. The county leaders should immediately clarify ideologically: production work is the center of all work, and cotton planting is the focus of production work in cotton-producing areas. They should quickly check the preparations for cotton planting, actively lead farmers in spring plowing, and sow in a timely manner.

### 束鹿产棉区农民为什么不愿多种棉？

　　束鹿产棉区农民为什么不愿多种棉？
    本报记者  鲁生
    “谷雨早，小满迟，立夏正当时。”这是束鹿县产棉区一带农民对种棉时间的经验。抗战前每年到了春耕时节，种棉农民为赶上立夏时播种，已经紧张的送粪耕地准备棉种了。但今年到了这时，才有部分农民往地送粪，个别农民开始耕地。为什么今年劲头不大呢？记者在该县三区礼?等村了解，农民对多种棉花，思想上还存有若干顾虑。因此当区干部问到农民准备种多少棉花时，他们口头上都是说：“要多种棉花。”但思想上却抱着准备着种够自己穿衣和出负担的，就不再多种了的主意。为什么农民不愿多种棉花？是有以下几个原因：
    第一、至今还有部分农民不了解人民政府今年的种棉政策，如有的农民问记者：“今年政府是不是还要号召大量种棉花？”
    第二、由于最近市场上棉花价格低于粮价，有些农民看不远，惟恐自己的口粮成问题，于是他们就打算道：“去年棉花不好，每亩只摘一百斤，当时一百斤棉可以换两石八斗米，比种谷子强；今年这时一百斤棉，只可换两石米，把工粪加起来不如种谷子。”因此他们就计划：“先种够吃的，然后再种棉花。”如礼?村劳动英雄李福成共种十亩地，只准备种三亩棉。
    供销社握有棉籽二百万斤，要农民拿粮去换，农民缺粮不换，至今棉籽还囤在那里
    第三、由于去年征棉全是征籽花，今年大部农民缺棉籽，如三区宋村共有地约四十七顷左右，今年计划种十八顷棉，但目前全村只有七千多斤籽，按每亩需种籽八斤计还差一半。据县领导同志谈：县供销社掌握有二百万斤棉籽，让农民拿粮去换，多数农民因缺粮不能换，要求先贷一部分，但未被供销社允许，有些农民干脆不换也不多种了。因此至今这二百万斤棉籽换出很少。
    此外，农民还有缺肥料缺牲畜等困难，怕发生蚜虫等顾虑，但这不是主要的。最主要的问题是该县领导思想上认为种棉时间还早，只忙于领导改造负担、民主建政等工作，忽视或根本未注意领导种棉工作，因而当前种棉工作中存在有什么问题，领导上既没了解也没计划去了解，更谈不到及时解决。这样下去，又会走去年因未适时播种，使棉花收获少的道路（按去年专、县干部到立夏后才到村中去督促农民种棉，结果因下种晚，到秋天收获很少。）
    目前清明即至，谷雨、立夏随着就来，立即抓紧领导农民进行种棉的一切准备工作再也不能迟疑了。该县领导上应立即从思想上明确：生产工作是一切工作的中心，而种棉又是产棉区的生产工作重点。应赶快检查种棉准备工作，积极领导农民进行春耕，适时播种。
