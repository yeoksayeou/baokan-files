Deputy delegation leader Roumanna (Xinjiang Tatar ethnic women representative) said, "The signing of this agreement, which is completely based on equality and mutual assistance, once again proves the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people." Tuerxun, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Democratic Youth Federation and Uygur youth representative, emphasized, "This agreement is enthusiastically supported by the Chinese people. The aggressors, led by American imperialism, will be extremely unhappy with this agreement. They will use all kinds of slander to malign us, but we, the people of all ethnic groups in China, know very clearly who are our enemies and who are our friends. We will respond to the American imperialists with our support for this agreement and widely promote the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the significance of this agreement among the youth of Xinjiang."
