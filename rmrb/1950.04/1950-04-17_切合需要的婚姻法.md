　　A Marriage Law That Meets Needs
    Zhang Zhirang
    The entire content of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is permeated by a basic principle: abolishing the feudal marriage system and implementing the New Democratic marriage system. The characteristics of the New Democratic marriage system are freedom of marriage for both men and women, monogamy, equality of rights between men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children. The main purpose of the Marriage Law is to liberate the vast number of women from the shackles of marriage, protect the interests of women and children, and ensure equal cooperation, mutual love, and mutual assistance between husband and wife, enabling them to work hard for a common cause. At the same time, it also takes into account the rights of men and parents and other aspects. The effect of the implementation of the Marriage Law is sufficient to provide both men and women with the conditions for pure love, sincerity, cooperation, and harmonious aging, to provide the final and important guarantee for social liberation, and to provide the foundation for the sound development of future generations.
    Chairman Mao pointed out when he investigated the peasant movement in Hunan: "In addition to being dominated by political power, religious power, and clan power like men, women are also dominated by husband power." These four powers represent the entire feudal patriarchal ideology and system, and are the four extremely large ropes that bind the Chinese people, especially the peasants. In the past, Chinese men and women solved their marriage problems under these four ropes.
    Freedom of marriage includes freedom to marry and freedom to divorce. In the feudal monarchical era, neither men nor women had any freedom to marry, either legally or in fact. During the period of the Northern Warlord Government, although the so-called case law formed by the precedents of the Supreme Court had recognized freedom of marriage, and the Six Codes of the Kuomintang reactionary government also stipulated it in the articles; however, just like their other actions, they were indifferent to matters that were closely related to the people but did not concern their own interests. The provisions on such issues were allowed to remain in legal form forever without affecting society. Therefore, the chains of feudal marriage always bound the people. People who move in small social circles must feel that this statement is exaggerated. If they delve into society to see, especially if they can go to the countryside to see, they will know that this is a fact everywhere. The situation in the old liberated areas and the new liberated areas is very different. The policy of implementing freedom of marriage in the old liberated areas has achieved considerable success. However, after all, the feudal marriage system has too deep a legacy of poison, and the new marriage policy is not easy to implement. Therefore, in many places, the phenomenon of unfree marriage still exists. As far as the current situation in the country is concerned, the seriousness of the marriage problem cannot be ignored. According to incomplete statistics from the second half of last year, the number of divorce cases in the four provinces of North China (Hebei, Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi) accounted for 50.21% to 68.52% of the total number of civil cases (the order of percentages is the order of the above four provinces). In terms of individual regions, marriage cases accounted for 99% of the total number of civil cases in Xingxian Sub-district from January to November 1949, 97% in Mengxian in September 1949, 46.9% in Shijiazhuang from January to June 1949, 42.8% in Harbin from August 23, 1949 to April 1949, and 13.4% in Beijing in 1949 (marriage cases handled by the mediation sections of various district offices in Beijing are not included). The vast majority of marriage cases in various places are divorce cases. From the above statistics, it can be seen that unreasonable marriages are very common everywhere, both in cities and even more so in rural areas. According to the statistics of Wenshui County, Shanxi Province from July to September 1949, Ningwu from January to September, and Daixian from January to October, marriage cases caused by buying and selling marriages, marriages arranged by parents, beatings of women, abuse of daughters-in-law by mothers-in-law, early marriage, bigamy, etc., accounted for 81% of the total number. The widespread existence of feudal marriage is an undeniable fact. Our Marriage Law abolishes all arranged and forced feudal marriage systems, prohibits anyone from extorting property through marriage relationship issues, stipulates that marriage must be completely voluntary by both men and women, and does not allow any third party to interfere, and clearly stipulates that those who violate this law will be punished according to law. It is truly a powerful detoxification agent aimed at the social diseases left over from the past.
    Freedom of divorce is another aspect of freedom of marriage. In the feudal monarchical era, the so-called "seven grounds for divorce" were completely laws of male oppression and male humiliation of women, and the so-called "righteous separation" was a forced divorce, and very few women could use it. Therefore, in that period, it can be said that there was no freedom of divorce at all. Although the precedents of the Supreme Court during the period of the Northern Warlord Government and the Six Codes of the Nanjing reactionary government all allowed divorce, if one party requested a divorce, it could not be granted unless the other party had one of the several listed circumstances. When the court enforced this law, it made things difficult in every way, so that the little freedom it gave was almost non-existent. As for the fact that they allowed this little freedom of law to not take effect in society, it goes without saying. Therefore, in the old society, there was even less freedom of divorce than freedom of marriage, and it was almost completely absent in the past rural areas. Therefore, in areas with deeper feudal vestiges, there were cases of women being branded on their lower bodies with red-hot irons by men for filing for divorce, or of being blinded and having their legs broken by men. There were three women killed by men in one county in one month for wanting a divorce. There were as many as 29 women forced to jump into wells and hang themselves in two county areas in half a year. There are also many cases of marital relationships between men and women in cities that must be terminated and changed. As soon as a city is liberated, divorce cases come in droves, and there is a trend of increasing year by year and month by month. Harbin received 108 marriage cases from August 23 to the end of 1946, 628 cases in 1947, 1081 cases in 1948, and 448 cases from January to April 1949. Tianjin received 4 cases in January 1949 and increased month by month, reaching 176 cases in June. Shanghai's trial cases increased month by month from 212 cases received in August 1949 to 501 cases in September; mediation cases increased month by month from 15 cases received in September 1949 to 78 cases in January 1950. These facts clearly show that in the past, people did not have freedom of divorce, especially women. The majority of marriage cases are divorce cases; the vast majority of divorce cases are women requesting divorce. For example, in the 77 divorce cases closed in Shanghai, only 7 were initiated by men, while 70 were initiated by women. These facts fully show that in the past, people did not have freedom of divorce, especially women. The lack of freedom of divorce has created countless unfortunate families and tragic events. This widespread and profound harm must be eliminated by the new state with the power of law, and the urgent problems of the people must be resolved in law. Therefore, the Marriage Law clearly declares: divorce shall be granted if both men and women voluntarily divorce; if one party resolutely demands a divorce, it shall also be granted if mediation by the district people's government and judicial organs is ineffective. If one party resolutely demands a divorce and mediation by the district people's government is ineffective, either party may appeal to the county or city people's court. The people's court shall first conduct mediation, and if mediation is ineffective, it shall make a judgment. In this way, marriages that must be dissolved are dissolved, and couples who can reconcile can reconcile. This provision most appropriately solves the divorce problem for both men and women.
    On the positive side, freedom of divorce is sufficient to increase happy marriages, reduce resentful spouses, promote reconciliation between the two parties, and consolidate family unity, so as to strive for a common cause. This positive effect is one of the easiest to be overlooked. Since unhappy marriages all have the freedom to dissolve, both men and women must take a very serious attitude towards the marriage issue. Before marriage, one must be very cautious to avoid regretting it; one must be very frank and sincere to avoid the other party regretting it. In this way, good marriages can be increased and bad marriages can be reduced in society. After marriage, both men and women must strive to reconcile to avoid the other party thinking of divorce. In this way, families can be united and cooperate to devote themselves to a common cause with all their strength. Therefore, Lenin pointed out long ago: "In fact, freedom of divorce will not 'disintegrate' family relations, but will strengthen it on a democratic basis, that is, on the only possible and solid basis in a civilized society."
    Monogamy is a good system that must be implemented. Our country has always advocated this. However, it has never really been achieved in the past. During the monarchical period and the period of the Northern Warlord Government, even full-fledged polygamy was recognized by law, such as concurrent inheritance. Needless to say, there was even polygamy in name only, such as concubinage. As for the "supplement to monogamy" and the "hypocritically concealed communal wife system" of polygamy, it has always been tacitly approved by law, such as adultery. The Six Codes of the Kuomintang reactionary government were cleverly falsified, and all these facts of polygamy were superficially prohibited, but indirectly allowed to exist. Therefore, de facto polygamy and de jure monogamy have always existed in parallel, especially among the wealthy classes. Our new China must resolutely eliminate it. Our Marriage Law regards monogamy and freedom of marriage as equally important from the outset, and reveals them, and clearly prohibits bigamy and concubinage. However, the facts of disguised and hidden polygamy have their own causes. We must also look at the causes and consequences in connection with each other in order to truly understand this issue. The kind of production relations in the past society was its root cause, and the lack of freedom of marriage was its direct cause. Therefore, to truly solve this problem, it is necessary to solve the problem of the causes from which it arises at the same time. The Communist Manifesto says: "With the elimination of the existing production relations, the communal wife, that is, the system of open and non-open prostitution, which arises from these production relations, will also be eliminated." This is from the relationship between social production relations and monogamy. Engels also speaks from the relationship between the two and freedom of marriage: "What will disappear most definitely from monogamy is all the characteristics added to monogamy due to its (monogamy's) occurrence in property relations. These characteristics are, first, the domination of men, and second, the indissolubility of marriage. ... If only marriages based on love are moral marriages, then only marriages in which love continues to exist are moral marriages." Only truly loving spouses can guarantee their purity, and as mentioned above, only an environment of freedom of marriage can guarantee the increasing number of happy marriages. Therefore, in addition to the comprehensive implementation of New Democracy as its fundamental condition, freedom of marriage is a direct and important condition for the complete realization of monogamy.
    In the past, men and women did not obtain equal rights in marriage and general family relations, even in law; in fact, there is no need to discuss it. Our Marriage Law accurately stipulates: husband and wife are equal in status in the family; both have the freedom to choose a profession, participate in work, and participate in social activities; both have equal ownership and disposal rights over family property; husband and wife have the right to use their own names; both have the right to inherit each other's inheritance. Women must have the freedom to choose a profession, participate in work, and participate in social activities, and have equal ownership and disposal rights over family property in order to obtain true equality between husband and wife. This equality can only be obtained under the New Democratic regime. After a divorce, if either man or woman has not remarried and has difficulty in life, the other party should help maintain their life. The Marriage Law still gives men such equal rights for the purpose of protecting the interests of women. This shows that the Marriage Law also takes into account the rights of men at the same time. Even men who completely stand on the opposite side of men and women to view the Marriage Law should understand that the Marriage Law only seeks the liberation of women for the provisions on marriage relations, and there is no unfairness to men. What's more, the provisions on freedom of marriage liberate women and also liberate men at the same time, because the men who have already obtained freedom of marriage are actually only a very small number of men.
    For those who neglect the activeness of the Marriage Law, we must also solemnly point out the following provisions contained in it: husband and wife are partners in common life; husband and wife have the obligation to love and respect each other, help each other, support each other, live in harmony and unite, work and produce, raise children, and strive together for family happiness and new social construction.
    Protecting the interests of children is as important as protecting the interests of women. The Marriage Law clearly stipulates that parents have the obligation to raise and educate their children (children have the obligation to support and assist their parents); prohibits infanticide or other similar criminal acts; neither husband nor wife shall abuse or discriminate against the children of the other party born to a previous spouse; after divorce, parents still have the responsibility to raise and educate their children born to them; after divorce, children within the lactation period shall in principle follow the mother, and children after the lactation period shall be decided by the people's court based on the interests of the children if both parties are willing to raise them and disputes arise and no agreement can be reached. Adopted children and children born out of wedlock are also protected. All this establishes important conditions for the prosperity and development of the nation.
    In addition, the Marriage Law has special provisions for the divorce of spouses of active revolutionary soldiers and marriage issues of ethnic minorities, which shows that it has taken care of all aspects in a thorough manner.
    Therefore, the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is a marriage law that is born in response to the times and meets the needs. Our government and the people of the whole country, regardless of men and women, should work together to strive for its complete implementation!

　　切合需要的婚姻法
    张志让
    中华人民共和国婚姻法的全部内容，为一个基本原则所贯彻，就是废除封建主义的婚姻制度，实行新民主主义的婚姻制度。新民主主义婚姻制度的特点，就是男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等，保护妇女和子女的合法利益。婚姻法的主要目的是要解放广大妇女所受婚姻上的束缚，保护妇女和子女的利益，并保障夫妻间平等合作、互爱互助、能为共同事业而努力的关系；而同时它又照顾到男子和父母的权利及其他各方面的关系。婚姻法实施的效果足以使男女双方都得到纯爱真诚、合作偕老的条件，社会解放得到最后的重要保证，后代子孙得到健全发展的基础。
    毛主席在考察湖南农民运动时，即已指出：“女子除与男子同受政权、神权、族权的支配外，还受夫权的支配。”这四种权力，代表了全部封建宗法的思想制度，乃束缚中国人特别是农民的四条极大的绳索。过去中国男女就在这四条绳索下解决他们的婚姻问题。
    婚姻自由包括结婚自由与离婚自由。结婚自由，在封建君主时代，男女双方，无论在法律上或事实上都丝毫没有。北洋政府时期，虽大理院以判例所形成的所谓判例法已经承认结婚自由，嗣后国民党反动政府的六法全书也在条文上加以规定；然而，正如他们的其他行动一样，凡于人民有切身关系而于自己利害无关的事情，一律漠不关心，对于这种问题的规定，一律让它永远停留在法律的形式上，而对社会不发生作用。所以封建婚姻的锁链始终束缚在人民的身上。这种说法，在社会小圈子里转动的人们必觉流于夸张。他们如果深入社会看看，尤其如果能到农村看看，就会知道这是到处皆然的事实。在老解放区，和新解放区的情况虽然有很大不同。老解放区实行婚姻自由的政策是有相当成绩的。但是，毕竟因为封建的婚姻制度，遗毒太深，新的婚姻政策不容易贯彻实行。因此还有许多地方，婚姻不自由的现象仍然存在。就目前全国情况而言，婚姻问题之严重是不容忽视的。就去年下半年不十分完全的材料所作统计来看，华北四省（平原、河北、察哈尔、山西）离婚案件数目占民事案件总数百分之五○·二一至百分之六八·五二（百分比的次序即上列四省之次序）。再就个别地区言之，兴县分区一九四九年一月至十一月的统计婚姻案件占民事案件总数百分之九九，盂县一九四九年九月份占百分之九七，石家庄一九四九年一月至六月占百分之四六·九，哈尔滨一九四九年八月二十三日至一九四九年四月占百分之四二·八，北京一九四九年占百分之一三·四（北京市各区公所调解科处理的婚姻案件尚不包括在内）。各地婚姻案件中极大多数是离婚案件。由上统计，可见不合理的婚姻到处都是很多，城市如此，农村尤甚。而就山西省文水县一九四九年七月至九月，宁武一月至九月，岱县一月至十月之统计来看，婚姻案件中由于买卖婚姻、父母主持的婚姻所发生的殴打女方、婆婆虐待媳妇、早婚、重婚等原因所引起的占总数百分之八一。封建婚姻的普遍存在，实系不可否认的事实。我婚姻法废除一切包办、强迫的封建主义婚姻制度，禁止任何人借婚姻关系问题索取财物，确定结婚必须男女双方本人完全自愿，不许任何第三者加以干涉，并明定违反本法者依法制裁，真是针对社会过去遗留的病症，而下的有力清毒药剂。
    离婚自由是婚姻自由的另一方面。在封建君主时代，所谓“七出”完全是男性压迫女性、男性侮辱女性的法律，所谓“义绝”则是强迫性的离异，而且也很少有女性能引用它，所以在那时期，离婚自由可说完全没有。北洋政府时期的大理院判例及南京反动政府的六法全书虽均准许离婚，然一方要求离婚者，非他方有所列几种情形之一，不得准许；而法院执行这种法律时，又多方为难，使仅予之一点自由亦几归于乌有。至于他们让这仅予一点自由的法律，也不在社会上发生作用，那是更不待言了。所以在旧社会中，离婚自由比结婚自由还少，在过去农村中则几乎完全没有。所以在封建遗毒更深的地区，有因女方提出离婚，而被男方以烧红烙铁烫其下部致死的，有被男方刺瞎眼睛、打断腿的。有在一县一个月内因欲离婚而被男子杀死的妇女三人。有两县地区在半年中被逼跳井上吊自尽的妇女至二十九人之多。城市中的男女婚姻关系必须解除变更的也不在少数。凡一城市，经解放后，离婚案件即源源而来，以后即有逐年逐月增加的趋势。哈尔滨自一九四六年八月二十三日至年底即收到婚姻案件一○八件，一九四七年六二八件，一九四八年一○八一件，一九四九年一月至四月四四八件。天津自一九四九年一月收案四件起，逐月增加，至六月，增至一七六件。上海审判案件自一九四九年八月收案二一二件起，逐月增加，至九月增至五○一件；调解案件自一九四九年九月收案十五件起，逐月增加，至一九五○年一月，增至七十八件。这些事实都明显表现了过去人民没有离婚自由，尤其妇女没有离婚自由。而婚姻案件中多数是离婚案件；离婚案件中极大多数是妇女要求离婚。即如上海离婚已结案件七十七件中，男方主动声请的只有七件，而女方主动声请的有七十件。这些事实都充分表明了过去人民没有离婚自由，尤其妇女没有离婚自由。没有离婚自由的结果造成了不知多少不幸的家庭和惨痛的事情。这种普遍深刻的弊害必须由新国家以法律的力量来予以扫除，人民的迫切问题必须在法律上得到解决。所以婚姻法明白宣布：男女双方自愿离婚的准予离婚；男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经区人民政府和司法机关调解无效时，亦准予离婚。男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经区人民政府调解无效时，男女任何一方均得向县或市人民法院申诉，人民法院应先进行调解，调解无效时，即行判决。这样就使必须解离的婚姻得到解离，可以好合的夫妻因而好合。这种规定最确当地解决了男女双方的离婚问题。
    离婚自由在积极方面足以增加美满婚姻、减少怨尤配偶、促进双方和好、巩固家庭团结，以努力从事于共同的事业。这种积极作用是最易被人忽视之一点。不幸的婚姻既都有解离的自由，男女两方对于婚姻问题就不能不采取十分严肃认真的态度。在结婚之前，自己必须十分慎重，以免自己后悔；必须十分坦白真诚，以免对方后悔。这样，社会上就可以增加好的婚姻，减少坏的婚姻。在结婚之后，男女双方必力求和好，以免对方思离。这样就可使家庭团结合作，以全力去从事共同的事业。所以列宁早就指出：“其实离婚自由并不会使家庭关系‘瓦解’，而反会使它在民主基础上，就是在文明社会惟一可能而坚固的基础上，强固起来”。
    一夫一妻是必须实行的好制度。我国也一向这样主张。可是过去却从来没有真正实现过。在君主时期及北洋政府时期，即名实俱全的一夫多妻亦有为法律之所承认的，如兼祧是。去名存实的一夫多妻更不待言，如纳妾是。至于那“补充一夫一妻制”的、“伪善地隐蔽着的公妻制”的一夫多妻则向为法律之所默许，如通奸是。国民党反动政府的六法全书则弄巧作伪，对于这几种一夫多妻的事实，都表面加以禁止，而间接许其存在。所以事实上的一夫多妻制与法律上的一夫一妻制是一向并行着，尤其是在富有阶级之间流行着。我们新中国必须坚决予以铲除。我婚姻法开章明义就将一夫一妻与婚姻自由视为并重，予以揭示，并明白禁止重婚与纳妾。可是变相的和隐蔽的一夫多妻的事实自有其发生的原因。我们还必须将原因与结果联系来看，才能真正了解这个问题。过去社会的那种生产关系是它的根本原因，婚姻不自由是它的直接原因。所以要真正解决这个问题，必须同时解决其所由发生的原因问题。共产党宣言说：“跟着现存的生产关系的消灭，从这生产关系中所发生的公妻，即公开的与不公开的娼妓制度，也会消灭”。这是从社会生产关系与一夫一妻制的关系来讲。恩格斯又从它们两者与婚姻自由的关系来讲：“最确定地将从一夫一妻制中消失掉的是加在一夫一妻制上的，由于它（一夫一妻制）发生于财产关系而加上的一切特征。这些特征是第一，男子的支配，第二，婚姻的不可解离性。……如果只有根据爱情的婚姻才是合于道德的婚姻，那么只有爱情继续存在的婚姻才是合于道德的婚姻”。只有真正相爱的配偶才能保证他们的纯洁，而如上所述，又只有婚姻自由的环境才能保证美满婚姻的日增。所以除全面实行新民主主义为其根本条件外，婚姻自由是完全实现一夫一妻制的直接重要条件。
    过去男女在婚姻关系及一般家庭关系中，就在法律上也没有得到平等的权利；在事实上更不必论。我婚姻法则确切规定：夫妻在家庭中地位平等；双方都有选择职业、参加工作、和参加社会活动的自由；双方对于家庭财产有平等的所有权与处理权；夫妻有各用自己姓名的权利；双方有互相继承遗产的权利。女方必须有选择职业、参加工作和参加社会活动的自由，并对于家庭财产有平等的所有权与处分权，才能得到夫妻间的真正平等。这种平等惟有在新民主主义的政权下，才能得到。离婚以后，男女任何一方如未再行结婚而生活困难，他方应帮助维持其生活。婚姻法在保护妇女利益之目的下，仍予男子以这样的平等权利，这表示了婚姻法也同时照顾到男子的权利，就是完全站在男女对立的立场来看婚姻法的男子，也应该了解婚姻法对于婚姻关系上的规定只要求得女子的解放，并没有对男子不公平的地方。何况婚姻自由的规定解放了女子，也同时解放了男子，因为已经得到婚姻自由的男子其实也还只是极少数的男子。
    对于忽视婚姻法之积极性的人们，我们还必须郑重指出它所载如下的规定：夫妻为共同生活的伴侣；夫妻有互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女、为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务。
    保护子女的利益是与保护妇女利益同样地重要。婚姻法明定父母对于子女有抚养教育的义务（子女对于父母有赡养扶助的义务）；禁止溺婴或其他类似的犯罪行为；夫妻任何一方对于他方与其以前配偶所生之子女，不得虐待或歧视；离婚后，父母对于所生的子女，仍有抚养和教育的责任；离婚后，哺乳期内的子女以随母为原则，哺乳期后的子女，如双方均愿抚养发生争执不能达成协议时，由人民法院根据子女的利益判决。养子女和非婚生子女也同样受到保护。这都为民族的强盛和发展建立下重要的条件。
    此外婚姻法对于现役革命军人配偶的离婚及少数民族婚姻问题，均有特别规定，尤足见其对于各方面都已照顾周到。
    所以中华人民共和国婚姻法是一部应时而生、切合需要的婚姻法，我政府与全国人民应该不分男女，一致为其完满实行而努力奋斗！
