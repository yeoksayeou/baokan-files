Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Health issued instructions on the 1950 medical and health work on the 14th, pointing out that: disease prevention, health care and medical institutions in various regions should, in accordance with the working principle of "prevention first, treatment as secondary", be restored and established gradually and in a planned manner. The Northeast and North China should establish some county-level health agencies according to needs and possibilities. Other regions should focus on restoration. All county-level health and medical institutions with health centers or hospitals should be changed to health centers. The health center should independently undertake the county's disease prevention and health care work, grassroots cadre training, and treatment work. All clinics in the counties should be changed to health stations to strengthen public health work.

　　District health stations should not simply engage in treatment work, but should do more disease prevention and health care work. The district health station should be the fulcrum of urban and rural health work, and should better organize local health personnel to carry out health care and treatment. Only in this way can the principle of giving priority to prevention be implemented.

　　Health authorities at all levels should take the consolidation of existing organizational structures and the transformation of the ideological style of staff as one of the central tasks this year, and overcome the irresponsible, commodity-like, or purely technical viewpoints of health personnel in the past. In terms of medical work, we must establish a new medical policy, attach importance to prevention, grasp treatment work in a timely manner, and strengthen nursing work.

　　For public and private health personnel, in addition to investigating the number of people or reissuing business licenses, various regions should not issue qualification certificates for the time being; however, those that have been announced for processing may continue to be processed.

　　The transformation and improvement of health personnel should be regarded as one of the important topics in medical and administrative work in the future. Health authorities at all levels should systematically lead public and private medical and pharmaceutical personnel to carry out political and technical studies, and try their best to encourage health personnel in private medical and pharmaceutical industries to participate in government work, or promote them to organize joint hospitals, joint clinics, or pharmaceutical cooperatives of a semi-cooperative nature, so that they can serve the broad masses of the people.

　　Health authorities at all levels must vigorously do a good job in uniting with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and improve them on the basis of unity. All localities must have organizations for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to pursue advanced studies. Health authorities above the provincial and municipal levels should plan and organize schools for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to pursue advanced studies.

　　The management of public hospitals and clinics should be standardized, scientific management systems should be formulated, and attention should be paid to improving the sense of responsibility of staff. Strengthen the management of private hospitals and clinics, improve their sense of responsibility, change their old medical styles, and mobilize private hospitals and clinics to participate in public health work.

　　中央人民政府卫生部
    发布今年医政工作指示
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府卫生部于十四日发布关于一九五○年医政工作的指示，指出：各地防疫保健和医疗机关应根据预防为主医疗为辅的工作方针，有计划地逐步恢复与建立。东北、华北应根据需要与可能，建立一部分县级卫生机关。其他地区则以恢复为重点。县级卫生医疗机关，凡设有卫生院或医院的，应一律改为卫生院。卫生院应独立担负全县的防疫保健工作，基层干部训练工作及治疗工作。各县设有诊所的应一律改为卫生所，加强公共卫生工作。
    区卫生所不应单纯作治疗工作，应更多地作防疫保健工作。区卫生所应是城乡卫生工作的支点，要更好地组织地方卫生人员进行保健和治疗。只有这样，才能贯彻以预防为主的方针。
    各级卫生机关应将整顿现有的组织编制及改造工作人员的思想作风，作为今年中心工作之一，克服过去卫生人员一切不负责任的、商品式或单纯的技术观点的思想作风。在医疗工作方面，要确立新的医疗方针，重视预防，及时掌握治疗工作，加强护理工作。
    对于公私卫生人员，各地区在目前除调查人数或换发开业执照外，不应再发资格证书；但已公布办理者仍可继续办理。
    卫生人员的改造与提高，应作为今后医政工作中的重要课题之一。各级政府卫生机关应有计划地领导公、私医药业的卫生人员进行政治和技术的学习，并尽可能争取私营医药业的卫生人员参加政府工作，或促使他们组织半合作社性质的联合医院、联合门诊所或医药合作社等，使其能为广大人民服务。
    各级卫生机关要以大力作好中医团结工作，并在团结的基础上予以提高。各地必须有使中医进修的组织。省市以上的卫生机关应筹划组织中医进修学校。
    对于公立医院、诊所的管理要正规化，制订科学的管理制度，注意提高工作人员的责任心。加强对私立医院、诊所的管理，提高他们的责任心，改变他们的旧医疗作风，并发动私营医院、诊所参加公共卫生工作。
