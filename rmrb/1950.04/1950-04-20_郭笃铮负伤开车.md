　　Guo Duzheng Drives Wounded
　　Comrade Guo Duzheng, a driver at the Xinxiang Locomotive Depot, was driving train No. 418 at 0:14 am on the 15th of last month. Between Tangyin Station and Baoliansi Station, the train's air pipe malfunctioned. He took a torch and got out of the locomotive to inspect it from the front to the rear. Later, the torch burned out, and he unfortunately fell off a bridge, injuring his right leg and rendering him unable to stand or walk. The inspectors and public security comrades serving on the train carried him to the locomotive. At that time, Comrade Guo was seriously injured and in great pain, but he thought that stopping the train mid-route would not only affect operations but also cause great losses to our people's railway. He endured the pain and continued to operate the train with the help of the fireman, finally driving the train to Anyang terminal station, completing the mission. At this time, Comrade Guo could no longer bear the pain. The workers at Anyang Station quickly carried him off the train and gave him emergency injections. He then took a car back to Xinxiang and is now recuperating in the Xinxiang Railway Hospital. According to the doctors, Comrade Guo's injury is very serious and will take at least two or three months to recover. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau commended Comrade Guo's highly responsible spirit and awarded him a bonus.

　　郭笃铮负伤开车
    新乡机务段司机郭笃铮同志，上月十五日午夜零时十四分驾驶四一八次列车。在汤阴站至宝莲寺站间，因列车风管发生故障，就拿了火把下车自机车向后检视，后来因火把燃尽，不幸失足坠落桥下，将右腿跌伤，不能起立行走。经随车服务的检车、公安同志抬至机车上。当时郭同志伤势甚重，痛苦不堪，但他想到列车中途停留，不但影响运行，且对咱们的人民铁路有很大的损失；便忍痛由司炉搀扶继续操纵，终于将列车驶抵安阳终着站，完成了任务。这时郭同志已痛苦的不能支持了，经安阳站工友赶忙抬下车来，施以紧急注射治疗后，就乘车回到新乡，现在新乡铁路医院疗养。据医士说：郭同志伤势甚重，最少也得两三个月始能出院。对郭同志这种高度负责精神，郑州路局特予表扬，并发给奖金。
