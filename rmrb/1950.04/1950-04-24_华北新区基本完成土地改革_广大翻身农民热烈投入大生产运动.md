Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The land reform movement in the North China New District has basically been completed. The feudal land system has been thoroughly eliminated in most areas, and the vast numbers of liberated peasants are now enthusiastically throwing themselves into the great production movement.

Apart from Suiyuan Province, which only implemented rent reduction, the other four provinces in North China—Shanxi, Chahar, Hebei, and Pingyuan—with a population of over ten million and more than 33,500 villages in the newly liberated areas, launched land reform movements last winter one after another. As of now, land reform has been completed in more than 25,500 villages, accounting for approximately 76% of the total number of villages in the New District. A total of 7,950 villages, accounting for 24% of the total number of villages in the New District, were unable to carry out land reform due to natural disasters or failed to complete it this spring. In addition, land reform work in the suburban areas of cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan has also been largely completed.

Adequate Preparation Work

In order to correctly complete the land reform work in the New District, the People's Governments of various provinces have made relatively adequate preparations. Starting from September last year, the provinces convened meetings of cadres at all levels, people's representative conferences at all levels, and peasant representative conferences one after another. Some regions also held cadre training classes to convey and discuss land reform policies. In Tongxian County and two other special districts in Hebei Province, the number of cadres participating in land reform meetings reached more than 20,000. Chahar Province trained more than 25,000 village cadres. After such large-scale training, the vast number of cadres and the people were made aware of land reform policies. After the land reform movement began, key pilot projects were generally carried out in various places. By November of last year, pilot projects in various places were largely completed, and in December, the land reform movement was fully launched. The provinces also specifically stipulated land reform guidelines based on different situations: in entirely new areas, land reform should be carried out with all efforts and closely integrated with production; in restored areas that had already undergone anti-traitor and rent reduction movements, and where land had been largely distributed, the focus should be on production combined with land adjustments, and land should not be redistributed; in areas severely affected by disasters, the masses should be organized to make every effort to engage in production for self-relief, and land reform should not be implemented for the time being. Such specific and clear work guidelines that met the demands of the masses enabled the land reform movement to progress smoothly in most areas.

Conscientiously Following Policies

During the movement, all localities conscientiously followed policies. The feudal property of landlords, including land, houses, draft animals, and farm implements, was confiscated, but other movable property of landlords was not touched, and basic property was not pursued or dug up. After confiscating the feudal land and property of the landlords, a share roughly equal to that of the peasants was left for them to engage in labor and production. The industry and commerce of the landlords, as well as connected workshops and tools, were resolutely protected in all localities. This not only accurately eliminated the feudal system, but also was very beneficial to future production development.

When classifying class status, all localities proceeded with great caution. In general, the peasant masses were first made aware of the criteria for class classification, and the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three-time public announcement was adopted, making class classification fair and reasonable. More than 90% of the rural population was united, and the ranks of the peasants were strengthened. However, in individual areas, when classifying class status, the classification of rural class components was not based on the relationship of ownership of the means of production, but only on "lifestyle" and "attitude." After the above-mentioned deviations were discovered by the leading organs, they were quickly corrected.

Raising Peasants' Class Consciousness

In terms of working methods, general areas adopted reasonable and legal struggle methods such as issuing notices, negotiations, registration, evaluation, and confiscation. At the same time, attention was paid to mobilizing the masses to speak out about their sufferings and reason things out, so that the vast number of peasants could understand the crimes of the feudal system and the landlord class, in order to raise the peasants' class consciousness. Only against individual elements who committed heinous crimes were mass struggle meetings organized, and judgments were made in accordance with legal procedures. As a result, there were few chaotic phenomena in the movement. The concept of the rule of law was established among cadres and the masses, and all sectors of society recognized the justice and rationality of land reform.

Peasants Quickly Turn to Production

All localities in the land reform process generally paid attention to publicizing the policies of getting rich through labor, that the People's Government protects all the fruits of labor, and protecting the property of newly rich peasants who hire laborers and operate under the new regime, stabilizing peasants' production mood. In places where land reform has ended, land certificates are issued in a timely manner, so that peasants who have obtained land can quickly settle down and turn to production with peace of mind. For example, in villages in Chahar Province where land reform has been carried out, land certificates are first issued to those who have been identified as middle peasants, so that the vast number of middle peasants are not subject to any fluctuations during land reform and can engage in production with peace of mind. Currently, more than 90% of the villages in the New District of the province that have completed land reform have issued land certificates. The villages that have already turned to production are now showing a new atmosphere. In Xirong Village, Yuci, Shanxi, peasants who had been allocated grain jointly bought 15 head of cattle and organized themselves to engage in large-scale production. In Yanggao and eight other counties in Chahar Province, peasants who have obtained land and some means of production have purchased more than 2,700 additional draft animals and repaired more than 2,000 carts. Villages in Baoding and other special districts in Hebei Province that have completed land reform are conducting major inspections to solve the difficulties peasants encounter when turning to production.

After land reform, the peasants' awareness and organization have been greatly improved. During the land reform, peasant representative meetings were generally convened in various places, and peasant associations were established as organs to lead the land reform work. According to statistics from Baoding Special District, during the land reform, the number of peasant association members increased by more than 200,000 (including more than 80,000 women). In the New District of Yuci County, Shanxi, more than 80% of the peasants have joined the peasant association, and more than 1,150 activists have emerged throughout the county, becoming the backbone of the land reform movement. In Fenyang and other places, after the land reform was completed, the work of adjusting village cadres and transforming grassroots political power was carried out.

　　华北新区基本完成土地改革
    广大翻身农民热烈投入大生产运动
    【新华社二十一日讯】华北新区的土地改革运动基本上已告完成，封建土地制度在绝大部分地区已彻底消灭，翻身后的广大农民现正热烈投入大生产运动。
    华北五省除绥远只实行减租外，其他山西、察哈尔、河北、平原等四省约一千余万人口、三万三千五百余村庄的新解放区，于去冬先后开展土地改革运动。截止目前，已完成土地改革的共有二万五千五百余村，约占新区总村数百分之七十六；因灾荒而不能进行土地改革或今春未能完成者共七千九百五十余村，占新区总村数百分之二十四。此外，北京、天津、太原等城市郊区土地改革工作亦已大体完成。
    准备工作比较充分
    各省人民政府为正确完成新区土地改革工作，都进行了较充分的准备工作。自去年九月开始，各省均先后召开了各级干部会议、各界人民代表会议和农民代表会，有些地区且举办干部训练班，传达和讨论土地改革政策。河北通县等三个专区，参加土地改革会议的干部即达二万人以上。察省训练了两万五千多个村干部。经过这样大规模的训练后，已使广大干部和人民群众了解土地改革政策。当土地改革运动开始后，各地一般都进行了重点试验工作；至去年十一月各地实验工作大致结束，十二月，土地改革运动即全面开展。各省并根据不同情况，具体规定了土地改革的方针：在崭新地区全力进行土地改革并密切结合生产；在已经过反奸、减租等运动，土地已大体分配的恢复区，则以生产为中心结合调剂土地，不再重新分配土地；在灾荒严重地区，则组织群众全力进行生产自救，暂不实行土地改革。这样具体明确适合群众要求的工作方针，使土地改革运动在绝大部分地区得到顺利的进展。
    认真按照政策办事
    在运动进行时，各地都十分认真地按照政策办事。对地主的封建财物土地、房屋、耕畜、农具一律实行没收，但对地主的其他浮财一律不动，底财一律不追不挖；没收了地主的封建土地、财产之后，并留给大体与农民相等的一份，使其能劳动生产。对地主的工商业以及与之相连的作坊、工具等，各地都予以坚决保护。这样不但准确地消灭了封建制度，且对今后发展生产十分有利。
    在划分阶级时，各地都以十分慎重的态度进行。一般地区首先使农民群众了解划阶级标准，采取自报公议、三榜定案的办法，使划分阶级做到了公正合理。团结了农村中百分之九十以上人口，壮大了农民的队伍。但个别地区在划分阶级时，不根据生产资料的占有关系区别农村阶级成份，而仅依据“生活”和“态度”来划分阶级。上述偏向经领导机关发觉后，即迅速予以纠正。
    提高农民阶级觉悟
    在工作方式上，一般地区都采用了下通知，谈判，登记，评议，进行没收等合理合法的斗争方式，同时并注意发动群众诉苦说理，使广大农民认识封建制度和地主阶级的罪恶，以提高农民的阶级觉悟；仅对个别罪大恶极分子，才组织大会斗争，并依法律手续进行判处。这样在运动中很少发生混乱现象，在干部和群众中也树立了法治观点，并使社会各阶层认识到土地改革的正义性和合理性。
    农民迅速转入生产
    各地在土地改革中，普遍注意了宣传劳动致富、人民政府保护一切劳动成果和保护在新政权下雇工经营的新富农的财产的政策，安定农民生产情绪。在结束土地改革的地方，又及时颁发土地证，使获得土地的农民迅速安心转入生产。如察省在土地改革的村庄，先发给已确定为中农的土地证，使广大中农在土地改革进行时，不受任何波动而能安心生产。现全省新区结束土地改革的村庄已有百分之九十以上发了土地证。业已转入生产的村庄，现已呈现了一片新气象。山西榆次西荣村，分到粮食的农民，合伙买牛十五头，组织起来投入大生产。察省阳高等八县，获得土地与部分生产资料的农民，共增购耕畜二千七百余头，增修大车二千余辆。河北保定等专区已完成土地改革的村庄，正进行大检查，以便解决农民转入生产时的困难。
    经过土地改革的地方，农民的觉悟性与组织性大大提高。在土地改革中，各地曾普遍召开了农民代表会，并成立农会，作为领导土地改革工作的机关。据保定专区统计，土地改革中，农会会员发展了二十多万（内有妇女八万余）。山西榆次县新区农民有百分之八十以上加入了农会，全县并涌现一千一百五十余积极分子，成为土地改革运动中的骨干。汾阳等地在土地改革结束后，并进行了调整村干部、改造基层政权的工作。
