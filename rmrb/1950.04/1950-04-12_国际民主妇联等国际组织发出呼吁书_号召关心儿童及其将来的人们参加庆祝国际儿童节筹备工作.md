Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 11th: The International Democratic Women's Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Federation of Teachers' Associations (the latter authorized to represent the World Federation of Trade Unions) have jointly formed an international preparatory committee to prepare for the International Children's Day on June 1st and the International Conference for the Protection of Children scheduled for the end of June. The preparatory committee issued an appeal on the 10th, calling on all who care about children and their future to fight for the protection of children.

　　The appeal first pointed out: Those who are wielding atomic bombs are stepping up preparations for another world catastrophe, and, as a prelude to the massacre, are already waging colonial wars in some countries in Asia. Millions of children are being threatened by the terror of atomic bombs, and they are suffering from the evils of insecurity and family poverty. In the colonies and dependent countries of Asia and Africa, millions of children are victims of hunger, disease, and appalling disasters. There, millions of children from the age of six are subjected to the pain of shameful labor exploitation.

　　The appeal continued: According to the United Nations Charter, the signatory countries have undertaken the obligation to protect children, guarantee their right to education, guarantee the possibility of their full development, and ensure that they are free from the scourge of war. Now, it remains for all people of goodwill to insist on these great principles that have not yet been respected, and it remains for all groups and organizations in the world to unite and strive for peace so that children can enjoy the joy of life.

　　The appeal finally called on women, youth, and workers all over the world to actively participate in the celebration of International Children's Day and the preparations for the International Conference for the Protection of Children.

　　国际民主妇联等国际组织发出呼吁书
    号召关心儿童及其将来的人们参加庆祝国际儿童节筹备工作
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟及教育工作者国际（后者受权代表世界工联），已联合组成国际筹备委员会，筹备六月一日举行的国际儿童节和定于六月底召开的国际保卫儿童会议。该筹备委员会并已于十日发出呼吁书，号召一切关心儿童及其将来的人们，为保卫儿童而斗争。
    呼吁书首先指出：舞弄原子弹的人们，正在加紧准备另一次的世界大灾难，而且，作为大屠杀的序幕，已经在亚洲的若干国家中，进行着殖民战争。数以百万计的儿童，正在受到原子弹恐怖的威胁，他们正苦于不安全与家庭贫困的恶果。在亚洲与非洲的殖民地与附属国家中，数以百万计的儿童成为饥饿、疾病与惊人灾祸的牺牲者。那里有成百万的儿童从六岁起就陷于可耻的劳力剥削的痛苦之中。
    呼吁书继称：按照联合国宪章，签字国已经承担了保卫儿童、保障他们受教育的权利、保证他们充分发展的可能性并且确保他们免于战祸的义务。现在，尚有待于一切善意的人们来坚持这些尚未受到尊重的伟大原则，并有待于全世界的一切团体和组织，团结起来，努力实现和平，使儿童们获得生活的快乐。
    呼吁书最后号召全世界的妇女们、青年们和工人们，积极参加国际儿童节的庆祝和国际保卫儿童会议的筹备事宜。
