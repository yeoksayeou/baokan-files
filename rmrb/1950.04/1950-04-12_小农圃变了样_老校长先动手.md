The "New Youth" blackboard bulletin of Municipal No. 8 Middle School's production special issue reminds students not to underestimate the small farm patch on campus. Two classes of first-year junior high school students began to tidy up the farm patch, turning it into rows of raised beds, ready for planting vegetables.

The production committee mobilized students to haul ditch mud from the sewers in Xidan to use as fertilizer. Every afternoon or during lunch break, a dozen baskets run back and forth on the road between Xidan and the school. Although the weather is not too hot, they all took off their clothes, their faces covered in sweat, and were full of enthusiasm.

On the morning of the 26th of last month, the students of Huiwen Middle School who were going to the fields for production gathered early at the designated location. Every student was exceptionally excited. At departure, the waist drum team led the way, followed by gongs and drums, and under five red flags, they set off for the countryside. When they arrived at the production area, the principal and heads of various departments had already arrived. The nearly seventy-year-old principal first picked up a pickaxe and worked for a while before the students began.

The original plan was to complete fifty plots that day, but they finished eighty-four plots in two hours.

The Production Committee of Shangyu Middle School plans to start cultivation soon, planting chives, shallots, tomatoes, peanuts, spinach, sweet potatoes, etc., according to the seasons. All teachers, students, and workers who have experience in vegetable growing have been hired as members of the production committee to lead production.

Jigao has been allocated twenty-five mu of land with a well. The address is south of the airport in the western suburbs, more than twenty li from the city. The production committee has hired two skilled workers, bought a mule, and prepared various farm tools. Last Sunday, the students from the first-year classes A and B who had bicycles were assigned to work. From 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., eighteen students leveled more than twelve mu of land.

　　小农圃变了样  老校长先动手
    市立八中的“新青年”黑板报生产专刊，提醒同学不要轻视校园内的小农圃。两班初一的小同学就来动手整理农圃，修成了一个个的垅台，预备种菜蔬。
    生产委员会发动同学到西单去抬下水道的沟泥，充作肥料。每天下午或午间休息的时候，十几个筐子便来回的在西单和学校的道上跑。天气虽不太热，可是他们却全都脱了衣服，满脸汗水，兴致勃勃。
                                            （市立八中通讯组）
    上月二十六日早上，汇文中学下地生产的同学，早早的便在指定地点集合了。每位同学都异常兴奋。出发时，腰鼓队带头，锣鼓随后，在五面红旗下面，向城外出发。到了生产区，校长和各部负责人早到了。将近七十岁的老校长，首先拿起镐来干了一阵之后同学们便开始了。
    本来计划这天完成五十畦，但两个钟点就干了八十四畦。
                                              （汇文通讯组）
    商育中学生产委员会计划近日即开始耕作，按季节前后播种韭菜、小葱、西红柿、花生、菠菜、白薯等。凡是对种菜有经验的先生、同学、工友，都被聘为生产委员会会员领导生产。

    冀高分地二十五亩，有水井一口。地址在西郊飞机场南边，离城二十余里。生产委员会已请好两个技术工人，买了一头骡子，并准备了各种农具。上星期日分配了一年级甲乙两班骑自行车的同学去工作。从上午十一点到下午三点，十八个同学就平了十二亩多地。
                                          （董树荣、王玲）
