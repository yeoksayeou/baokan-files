Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th—The reorganization of governments at all levels in the East China region was basically completed by the end of June. The reorganization work in the East China region began at the end of March, and was carried out in three stages: mobilization and study, implementation of the new establishment, and preliminary handling of surplus personnel. After studying the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" and other relevant documents of the Central People's Government's State Council, all staff members in various regions generally had a clear understanding of the significance of the reorganization, enabling the reorganization work to proceed smoothly.

According to the regulations of the Central People's Government's State Council and the actual conditions in various regions, Northern Jiangsu and Shandong were reorganized according to the old liberated area establishment; Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Fujian, Shanghai, Nanjing and other provinces, cities, and administrative regions were reorganized according to the new liberated area establishment.

In this reorganization, the people's governments of various provinces, cities, and administrative regions first adjusted their institutions to better suit the needs of their work. Shandong abolished three administrative offices, six commissioner offices, and four county governments; Zhejiang and Southern Anhui each abolished one commissioner office; Northern Jiangsu abolished one county government; Shanghai added thirty district people's governments. After the establishment of the entire East China region, there were a total of 663,000 staff members, with more than 36,000 vacancies in the new establishment and more than 97,000 surplus personnel. Some of the surplus personnel may be able to fill the vacancies after training, while others will be demobilized.

In the past, the phenomenon of unauthorized expansion of personnel or the holding of training classes without approval in various parts of East China has basically stopped after the reorganization began, thus enabling accurate statistics of personnel numbers and a correct basis for national financial expenditures.

Secondly, according to the determined establishment plan, government agencies at all levels have systematically adjusted their organizations and equipped them with cadres. Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and other provinces, regions, and cities have especially enriched the institutions of financial and economic departments, strengthening and increasing the quality and quantity of financial and economic cadres. For example, Southern Jiangsu region transferred 4,200 people from other work positions to work in financial and economic agencies; the heads of the four commissioner district tax bureaus were filled by cadres at the level of county head or financial section chief; the entire region's tax agencies were also changed from six levels to three levels. When the Northern Jiangsu region assigned the work of 900 students from the region's cadre school, more than 800 of them were assigned to work in financial and economic agencies. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government merged the Municipal Goods Tax Bureau, the Direct Tax Bureau, and the tax departments of the Municipal Finance Bureau to form the Municipal Tax Bureau, strengthening the unity of leadership and adding more than 2,000 cadres. In Southern Anhui, the heads of sixteen county tax bureaus were originally part-time positions, and now most of them have been assigned full-time cadres. In addition, all localities have appropriately reduced support staff according to the standard of seven cadres to one support staff. For example, Northern Jiangsu has been reduced from five to one to ten to one; most agencies in Shanghai are between seven to one and ten to one.

After the reorganization in various places, work efficiency and work style have begun to show some progress. For example, although the number of personnel in each section of the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Education Bureau has decreased after the reorganization, due to the clear division of labor and the overcoming of the past bureaucratic work style, it has begun to be able to organize manpower to go down and inspect work. The procedures for handling official documents by people's governments at all levels have also largely established scientific systems, which have been rapidly improved.

All localities in East China are generally very cautious in handling surplus and extra-establishment personnel, and have implemented the policy of "taking everyone on board" in dealing with old personnel. Personnel needed to be supplemented by various departments are generally first called from the surplus personnel, and those who have not been called have also been concentrated in various places for study, waiting for unified allocation. Among them, many cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds will enter worker-peasant rapid middle schools for study after passing the examination. Some of the elderly, weak, and sick have been preliminarily arranged for recuperation, and necessary assistance and care have also been given to a small number of people who voluntarily return to their hometowns to engage in production or change jobs.

Some deviations have also occurred in the reorganization work in various places. The main problem is the failure to fully proceed from reality, and the unwillingness to retain staff members with weaker abilities, slower ideological transformation, and female comrades with children. For example, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau once proposed to have more than 1,200 surplus personnel in the draft establishment, while the vacancies amounted to more than 5,300. Secondly, individual regions have experienced the phenomenon of forced orders. For example, individual counties and districts in Shandong did not conduct political mobilization before the reorganization, but used simple administrative orders such as "the superior is transferring you" and "transferring you to study" to mobilize cadres, which affected the morale of cadres. These deviations have been promptly corrected.

### 华东各级人民政府整编工作基本结束

　　华东各级人民政府整编工作基本结束
    【新华社上海二十五日电】华东区各级人民政府的整编工作，已在六月底基本完成。华东全区整编工作开始于三月底，分为动员学习、实行新编制、初步处理编余人员等三个步骤进行。各地所有工作人员在学习中央人民政府政务院“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”及其他有关文件后，一般都能明确认识整编的意义，使整编工作得以顺利进行。
    根据中央人民政府政务院的规定和各地实际情况，苏北和山东依老区编制整编；浙江、苏南、皖南、皖北、福建、上海和南京等省市、和行署区均按新区编制进行整编。
    各省、市、行署区人民政府在此次整编中，首先是调整机构，使其更切合工作需要。山东撤销了三个行政公署、六个专员公署、四个县政府；浙江、皖南各撤销一个专员公署；苏北撤销一个县政府；上海市添设了三十个区人民政府。全华东区编定后全部工作人员共有六十六万三千多人，新编制的缺额尚有三万六千多人；编余九万七千多人。编余人员中一部分经过整训后可能补充缺额，另一部分则将复员。
    过去华东各地不经批准即擅自扩大人员或举办训练班等现象，在整编开始后已基本停止，因而使员额有了精确统计，国家财政开支有了正确的依据。
    其次，根据确定的编制方案，各级政府机关，均有计划地调整了组织，配备了干部。苏南、苏北、皖南、福建、浙江、上海等省、区、市特别充实了财经部门的机构，加强和增添了财经工作干部的质量和数量。如苏南区即有四千二百人从其他工作岗位调配到财经机关工作；四个专署区税务局局长都以县长或财经处长一级干部充任；全区税务机构也从六级改为三级。苏北区在分配该区干部学校九百名学员的工作时，其中八百多人被分配到财经机关工作。上海市人民政府将所属货物税局、直接税局及市财政局的税务部门合并成立了市税务局，加强了领导的统一，并增加了二千多个干部。皖南区有十六个县税务局局长原来均为兼职，现在大部都调配了专职干部。此外，各地都以干部与勤杂人员七比一的标准酌量减少了勤杂人员。如苏北已由五比一减为十比一；上海市大部机关均在七比一和十比一之间。
    各地经过整编后，工作效率和工作作风已经开始有某些进步。如青岛市人民政府教育局各科整编后人员虽已减少，但由于分工明确，而且克服了过去的事务主义作风，已开始能够组织人力下去检查工作。各级人民政府处理公文的手续也大都建立了科学的制度，迅速提高。
    华东各地处理编余和编外人员一般都很慎重，对旧人员的处理贯彻了“一齐包下来”的政策。各部门需要补充的人员，一般都首先从编余人员中去调用，未被调用人员亦已在各地集中学习，等待统一调配。其中不少工农出身的干部，经考试后，将进入工农速成中学学习。若干老弱病员已初步安置休养，少数自愿返乡生产或转业的亦已予以必要的帮助和照顾。
    各地的整编工作也曾发生过一些偏向。主要是未能完全从实际出发，不愿留用能力较弱、思想改造较慢的留用人员和有孩子的女同志。如上海市人民政府公安局在编制草案中曾拟编余一千二百多人，而缺额达五千三百多人。其次是个别地区曾发生强迫命令的现象。如山东个别县区在整编前不进行政治动员而用“上级调你”和“调你去学习”等单纯依靠行政命令的方法调动干部，以致影响干部情绪。这些偏向均已被及时纠正。
