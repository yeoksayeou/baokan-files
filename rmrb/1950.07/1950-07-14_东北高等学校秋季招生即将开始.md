　　Autumn Enrollment for Northeastern Universities to Begin Soon
　　The autumn enrollment plan for universities in the Northeast region has been unified based on the current situation of each school and the needs of economic construction in the Northeast. The eleven schools enrolling students this autumn include Northeast People's University, Northeast Normal University, Shenyang Institute of Technology, Shenyang Agricultural College, Harbin Foreign Language College, Dalian University, China Medical University, Yanbian University, Northeast Commercial College, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Northeast Navigation College. Nine schools have already formed a unified enrollment committee and are dispatched to Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and other places for enrollment. It is estimated that the schools will enroll a total of 3,910 new students this autumn, with engineering students accounting for the largest proportion.
　　The registration date for schools enrolling within the customs is from July 14th to 17th, and the examination dates are the 21st and 22nd.
　　Regarding student benefits, all students at Northeast Normal University can receive a first-class scholarship, and all students at Northeast People's University and Harbin Foreign Language College are on a supply system. Other schools also waive tuition, miscellaneous fees, sports fees, handout fees, lab fees, and accommodation fees. Students with genuinely impoverished family backgrounds and excellent academic performance can also apply for scholarships. New students who travel to the school collectively according to regulations will have their travel expenses covered by the school, and a portion of their food expenses will be subsidized.
