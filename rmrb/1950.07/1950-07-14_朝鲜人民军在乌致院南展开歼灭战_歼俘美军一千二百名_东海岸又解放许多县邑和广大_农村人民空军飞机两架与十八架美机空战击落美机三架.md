　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th] The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the evening of the 12th that People's Army troops had surrounded a portion of the American army south of Wochon in Chungcheongnam-do on the 11th and launched an annihilation battle. As a result, more than 700 American soldiers were eliminated and nearly 500 were captured alive. Fifteen American tanks and five armored vehicles were destroyed; four tanks, more than 1,000 automatic rifles and rifles, and several anti-tank guns and other war materials were seized. The People's Army troops broke through the American defense line and continued to advance south.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th] The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced in a battle report on the morning of the 13th that People's Army troops liberating the Uljin area on the east coast had successively liberated many counties, towns, and vast rural areas, and are currently advancing south.
　　On the 11th, two heroic People's Air Force planes engaged 18 American Air Force B-38 bombers, nearly ten times their number, in an air battle over Pyeongtaek, resulting in the downing of three American aircraft.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 13th] TASS, Pyongyang, 12th: The working people in the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are supporting the front lines with all their strength through selfless work. Personnel in mines, factories, textile mills, and train stations have organized support teams under the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for victory!" and launched competitions to increase production by one and two times. In the Wonkan factory (one of the departments where only young people work), 160% of the production plan has been completed since the first days of the war. At the beginning of July, the department held a production meeting under the initiative of the Democratic Youth League, at which production personnel decided to regard themselves as production fighters and complete no less than 200% of the daily output.
　　The patriotic youth in the factories are also victoriously fulfilling the promises they have made.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 13th] TASS, 12th dispatch from Tokyo: The American army continues to be transferred from Japan to Korea. It is very noteworthy that the American soldiers sent to Korea are all downcast and in low spirits. They curse the soldiers of the rear units who remain in Japan in the most rude language, "and invite them to take a walk in the place where the fighting is in full swing."
　　News from South Korea indicates that Americans are using civilians to build fortifications, and women and children are no exception. Photos published in the "Stars and Stripes" show several teenagers working at the fortification site. Half-starved people are forced to work from morning till night.
　　It is also learned that Americans treat captured wounded soldiers of the Korean People's Army with the most brutal means. United Press reporter Miller said: "The wounded prisoners of war lay on the ground for hours in the hot weather. They have no medical assistance, nothing to eat, and not even water to drink."

　　朝鲜人民军在乌致院南展开歼灭战
    歼俘美军一千二百名
    东海岸又解放许多县邑和广大
    农村人民空军飞机两架与十八架美机空战击落美机三架
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十二日晚发表战报称：人民军部队于十一日在忠清南道乌致院以南地区将美陆军部队一部包围，展开歼灭战。结果，歼灭美军七百余名，活捉近五百名，并击毁美军坦克车十五辆，装甲车五辆；缴获坦克车四辆，自动枪步枪一千余支，反坦克炮数门及其他战利品极多。人民军部队突破美军防线，继续向南挺进。
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜人民军总司令部十三日晨发表战报称：东海岸方面解放蔚珍地区的人民军部队陆续解放了众多的县、邑和广大的农村，刻正南进中。
    十一日英勇作战的人民军空军飞机两架在平泽上空与在数量上几乎十倍于己的美空军Ｂ３８型轰炸机十八架进行空战结果，击落美机三架。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社平壤十二日电：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部的劳动人民，正以忘我的工作来全力支援前线。矿坑、工厂、纺织工厂以及火车站的人员，都在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利！”的口号下组织了支前队，并展开增加一倍和两倍产量的竞赛。在元干工厂（只有年青人工作的部门之一），自战争爆发的最初几天以来，就完成生产计划的百分之一百六十。七月初，该部门曾在民主青年同盟的倡导下召开了生产会议，生产人员在会上决定把他们自己当作生产的战士，完成不少于百分之二百的每日产额。
    工厂里的爱国青年们也正在胜利地实现着他们所作的保证。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十二日电引东京消息：美军继续自日本调至朝鲜。非常值得注意的事情是，被派往朝鲜的美军都垂头丧气，心情悲苦。他们用最粗暴的语言咀咒仍留日本的后方部队的军人，“并请他们到打得如火如荼的地方去散散步”。
    来自南朝鲜的消息指明：美国人正用平民建筑防御工事，妇孺也不能例外。从星条报刊登的照片中看出有好几个少年在防御工事的现场工作。半饥饿状态的人民被迫从早到晚工作。
    并悉：美国人以最残暴的手段对待朝鲜人民军被俘的伤兵。合众社记者米勒称：“受伤的战俘在酷热的天气下躺在地上数小时之久，他们没有任何医药援助，没有东西吃，甚至没有水喝。”
