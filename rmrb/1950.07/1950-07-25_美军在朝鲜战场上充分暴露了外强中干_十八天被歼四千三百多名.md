Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: American imperialism's "outward strength but inward weakness" has been prominently exposed on the Korean battlefield.

The only "skill" of the U.S. military is to fire artillery at peaceful residents.
If the American invading army has one "skill," it is the wanton bombing and shooting of peaceful Korean residents. From July 3rd to 6th alone, in the four days of bestial shelling by the American fleet of streets and villages near Chuminjin on the east coast of Gangwon Province, over 1,000 civilian houses and schools on the peaceful streets of Chuminjin were destroyed, and thirty fishing boats were damaged or sunk. American planes brutally bombed important peaceful cities in Korea. In Wonsan, North Korea, alone, according to statistics up to July 21st, the city had been bombed seven times, with 1,088 houses and public buildings destroyed, including several schools, a Red Cross hospital, a municipal hospital, and a sanatorium, killing 1,249 civilians. The Wall Street bosses are trying to use this bestial massacre to intimidate the Korean people who demand independence and unification.

Under the counterattack of the Korean people's iron fists, the U.S. military suffered five major defeats and five retreats.
But the American imperialists miscalculated. The Korean people are not sheep to be intimidated, but steel giants. It is the American soldiers who grew up in a life of licentious debauchery who are frightened. They appear so small in the face of the Korean People's Army. From July 3rd, when the U.S. 24th Division formally joined the war, to the 20th, in the eighteen days, the U.S. Army, under the counterattack of the Korean People's Army, had suffered five defeats and made five retreats in Suwon, Cheonan, Jochiwon, Geum River, and Daegu, the temporary capital of the Syngman Rhee puppet government. Under the blows of the Korean people, the American invading beasts were so panicked that British and American journalists had to reveal the following ridiculous facts: General Church, the commander of the U.S. military headquarters in Korea, "only learned about the retreat when he saw his personnel burning the headquarters and airport equipment. Church's 300 or so staff and affiliated personnel scrambled onto 50 trucks and jeeps, and within fifteen minutes of the first air raid alert, headed straight for Daejeon. The entire team trudged for eight hours in the pouring rain to reach Daejeon and still did not know who issued the retreat order" (Reuters Tokyo, July 1st).

American soldiers have only one desire: to be as far away from the People's Army as possible.
When the Korean People's Army liberated Cheonan, the U.S. military "immediately retreated upon discovering the People's Army. The artillery did not fire a single shot, and the jeeps carrying officers and soldiers sped away. At this time, the U.S. military had only one desire: to be as far away from the North Korean army as possible" (Associated Press Tokyo, July 8th). "American troops took off their shoes to run faster from the North Korean troops pursuing them. The U.S. military fled so fast that they did not have time to take the wounded with them. Some American soldiers joined long lines of Korean soldiers and 'refugees' to save their lives, running for thirty-five miles" (Associated Press reporter Han Do-man, July 7th).

The Electric News Agency reporter pointed out: The U.S. military on the Suwon front retreated after fighting for seven hours, "The Korean People's Army advanced twelve to sixteen kilometers on July 6th, while the U.S. military fled south in one breath for twenty-four kilometers."

A peculiar "surprise sickness" has occurred in the American invading army. The Associated Press reporter said: "These American soldiers were immediately rushed from Japan to Korea after receiving orders, which was a surprise; they could not stop the North Korean tank offensive, which was another surprise; ...it was a great surprise for them as Americans to have suffered a defeat, especially to an unfamiliar enemy...When a person who is mentally and even more physically exhausted faints, the doctor hangs a sign on him that says: Surprise sickness."

Three commanders replaced in less than three weeks of combat; thousands of cannon fodder sent to their deaths in the Battle of Daejeon
In less than three weeks of combat in Korea, the U.S. military changed three commanders. General Church, the first commander of the U.S. military in Korea, took office on June 27th, and was dismissed after five days for losing Suwon. On July 2nd, Dean, the commander of the U.S. 24th Division, took over, but judging from the embarrassing situation and the speed of retreat of the U.S. military during this period, his command ability was not much stronger than Church's. Ten days later (July 12th), Dean's position was replaced by Walker, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army. Walker did not show that he was superior to Dean either. The Geum River defense line he boasted "would never retreat" was broken, and Daejeon was captured by the People's Army. Walker lost his commander of the 24th Division and its former commander-in-chief Dean and thousands of American soldiers while withdrawing from Daejeon, constituting the largest defeat of the U.S. military since the Korean War.

Captured American soldiers are greedy for life and afraid of death; very happy to receive preferential treatment
According to incomplete statistics, from July 3rd to 20th, in the eighteen-day period, the U.S. military in Korea has suffered more than 3,650 casualties and 710 captures. The disgusting, life-greedy and death-fearing shrinking expressions of the captured American soldiers are in stark contrast to their swaggering on the streets of Tokyo. U.S. Army Lieutenant Selman, a prisoner of war, is a typical example. He admits that the Korean People's Army "fights like a lion." He said unhappily, "I didn't expect this. I always heard that Koreans couldn't match Americans." He said, "I was a driver just because the treatment was good, and now, a small house in Philadelphia is very good to me." This American "warrior" did not feel ashamed or remorse after being captured, and felt happy that he was still alive. This is an example of the greed for life and fear of death of the "American heroes" that Truman praised so much.

American interventionists are continuing to mobilize and reinforce troops to Korea, and American aircraft are continuing to wantonly bomb peaceful Korean people. However, under the united iron fist of the Korean people, the new intervention troops will eventually suffer the shameful defeat that the U.S. 24th Division has already tasted.

### 美军在朝鲜战场上充分暴露了外强中干  十八天被歼四千三百多名

　　美军在朝鲜战场上充分暴露了外强中干
    十八天被歼四千三百多名
    【新华社二十四日讯】美帝国主义的“外强中干”，在朝鲜战场上突出地暴露出来。
    侵略军的唯一“本领”是向和平居民开大炮
    美国侵略军队如果说有一种“本领”的话，那就是对朝鲜和平居民的滥肆轰炸与射击。仅在七月三日至六日的四天中，美国舰队在江原道东海岸注文津附近的海面上，对岸上的街道与农村进行兽性的炮击中，便使注文津和平街道上的一千余所民房与学校被炸毁，三十艘渔船被破坏或击沉。美机残暴地轰炸了朝鲜各重要的和平城市，仅北朝鲜的元山一城，据截至七月二十一日止的统计，已被轰炸七次，被毁的房屋与公共建筑达一千零八十八所，包括好几所学校、红十字医院、市立医院和疗养院，炸死平民一千二百四十九名。华尔街的老板企图用这种兽性的屠杀，来吓倒要求独立统一的朝鲜人民。
    在朝鲜人民铁拳还击下  美军五次大败五次撤退
    但美帝国主义者是算错了。朝鲜人民不是可以吓倒的绵羊，而是钢铁般的巨人。吓坏的倒是那些从荒淫无耻的酒色生活中长大起来的美国军人。他们在朝鲜人民军的面前，显得多么渺小。自七月三日美军第二十四师正式参战至二十日的十八天中，美国陆军在朝鲜人民军铁拳的还击下，已在水原、天安、鸟致院、锦江及李承晚傀儡政府的临时首都大田等地打了五次败仗，作了五次撤退。在朝鲜人民的打击下，美国侵略野兽们是如此惊慌，以致英美记者不得不透露如下的可笑事实：朝鲜美军总部的指挥官邱奇“在看到自己的人员在烧毁总部及机场的设备时，才知道撤退的事，邱奇的三百名左右参谋及附属人员乱成一团地拥上五十部卡车和吉普车，在首次空袭警报发出后的十五分钟之内，就直奔大田而去。全队人马在倾盆大雨下跋涉八小时才抵大田，迄今尚不知撤退令为何人所下”（路透社东京七月一日电）。
    美国兵只有一种意愿  距离人民军越远越好
    在朝鲜人民军解放天安时，美军一发现人民军便“立即奉令撤退了，炮队未开一炮，吉普车载着官兵飞奔。此时，美军只有一种意愿，即：距北朝鲜军愈远愈好”（合众社东京八日电）。“美国军队脱掉他们的鞋子，好更快地逃开追击他们的北朝鲜军队。美军逃得这样快，以至于来不及带着伤兵一道走。有若干美军为了保命，加入了一长串一长串的朝鲜士兵和‘难民’的行列，奔跑了三十五英里”（美联社记者韩多曼七日报道）。
    电通社记者指出：水原前线上的美军打了七小时的仗便后退，“朝鲜人民军于七月六日前进十二至十六公里，而美军则一口气向南逃跑了二十四公里”。
    美国侵略者军队中已发生了一种特有的“吃惊病”。美联社记者说：“这些美国兵在接到命令之后，立即从日本驰往朝鲜，这是一件吃惊的事；他们不能阻挡北朝鲜坦克的进攻，是另一件吃惊之事；……作为美国人而竟吃了败仗，使他们大为吃惊，尤其是败给一个素不相识的敌人……当一个精神上甚至比肉体上还要疲倦的人晕倒之时，医生就给他挂上一个牌子，上面写道：吃惊病。”
    作战不及三周三易统帅  大田一战送了数千炮灰
    美军在朝鲜作战不及三周中，就换了三个统帅。首任朝鲜美军司令邱奇于六月二十七日上任，做了五天，便因丢掉水原而去职。七月二日，美第二十四师师长迪安接任，但从这时期中美军的狼狈情况及败退的速度看来，他的指挥能力并不比邱奇强多少。十天以后（七月十二日），迪安的职位又被美第八军军长瓦克所代替。瓦克亦没有表现出比迪安高明。他所吹嘘谓“决不后退”的锦江防线被突破，大田被人民军攻克了。瓦克在与退出大田同时，丧失了他指挥的第二十四师师长及其前任总指挥迪安和数千美军，构成了朝鲜战事以来美军的最大一次惨败。
    被俘美军贪生怕死  受到优待高兴得很
    据不完全的统计自七月三日至二十日的十八天期间，美军在朝鲜已死伤三千六百五十余名，被俘七百一十名。被俘的美军，那种令人作呕的贪生怕死的畏缩神情，与他们在东京街头上的耀武扬威适成强烈的对照。美国被俘军人中尉塞尔曼就是一个典型。他承认朝鲜人民军“打起仗来像狮子一样”的勇猛。他怏怏不乐地说：“我没料想到这样，我总是听说朝鲜人不能与美国人匹敌”。他说：“我当驾驶员只是因为待遇好，而现在，费城的小屋对我已是很好了”。这个美国“勇士”在被俘以后，毫不觉得羞耻与忏悔，并因为他仍然能活着而觉得高兴。这就是为杜鲁门所大加吹嘘的“美国健儿”的贪生怕死的一例。
    美国干涉者正在继续动员和增兵朝鲜，美国飞机正在继续滥轰朝鲜和平民众。但是，在朝鲜人民举国一致的铁拳之下，新的干涉军终将遭到如美国第二十四师所已尝到的可耻的失败。
