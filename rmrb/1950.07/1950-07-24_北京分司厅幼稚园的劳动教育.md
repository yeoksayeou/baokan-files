　　Labor Education at Beijing Fensiting Kindergarten
　　By our reporter Mu Yang
　　After a period of study following liberation, the teachers at Beijing Municipal Fensiting Kindergarten began to embrace new educational viewpoints. They integrated labor education into the children's daily life and games, changing the previous trend of children looking down on labor.

　　Last summer, the kindergarten teachers and workers used a vacant plot in the schoolyard where flowers used to be planted to grow corn and soybeans. When they ripened, the teachers led the children to observe the harvest; they also let the children help pick bean pods and break off corn. They were cooked and distributed to everyone to eat. The children found them especially delicious and were particularly happy, and asked the teachers to plant corn and soybeans again. Due to the seasonal constraints, they changed to planting radishes and Chinese cabbage. The teachers sometimes led the children to do simple and easy work such as picking up bricks, catching insects, and pulling weeds. The children also found it fun to do, and gradually became the little helpers of the teachers and worker uncles. Afterwards, whenever a plot of land was vacated, the children would be concerned about what to plant next. Although it is summer vacation now, when the children come to school to play, they stand outside the fence, looking concernedly at the vegetables in the garden.

　　The teachers always pay attention to educating children to develop a concept of respecting working people. Once, a coal worker was shaking coal briquettes in the schoolyard, and the children suddenly unconsciously sang an old children's song: "Guess who I am? I am a coal blackie. Black face, white teeth, shaking away all day." Four-year-old Chen Yansheng also shouted, "Coal blackie! Coal blackie!" The teacher heard this and felt that this incorrect concept needed to be corrected, so she asked everyone: "Was his face originally black?" "No, it was blackened by coal dust." Many voices answered this way. The teacher then asked: "Why is he wearing only a single layer of clothing?" "He is hot." "Why is he hot? We are still cold even wearing cotton clothes?" "He is working hard shaking coal briquettes!" "Who is he shaking coal briquettes for?" "For us!" Everyone answered without hesitation. Then the teacher followed up by asking: "He is shaking coal briquettes for us, what should we do for him?" Chen Yansheng and the children who sang the song blushed a little, and ran to apologize to the coal worker, asking the uncle to forgive them. Afterwards, they no longer sang that old children's song, and replaced it with a song the teacher composed: "Don't look at your black face, I can't do the work you do, shoveling dirt and carrying water, you are really tired for everyone."

　　In the past, the classroom was always cleaned by the female worker. However, most of the children did not pay attention to the cleanliness of the classroom, often stepping on the stools with dirt and littering paper scraps on the ground. This semester, the teachers led the children to conduct two major cleanings themselves, letting the children move small chairs by themselves, try to sweep the floor, and always explain to the children that cleaning and keeping it clean is not easy, and educating everyone to love cleanliness, so that the cleaning worker auntie has to work a little less hard. Since then, the cleanliness of the classroom has improved a lot.

　　Once, the kindergarten was building a house, and many children gathered there to watch the plasterers mix mud and throw bricks. Seven-year-old Zhao Changhai showed off and said, "Anyone can do this, I can also mix mud!" The teacher deliberately let him try. He shoveled a few times with the iron shovel, and his little face turned red. At this time, the teacher told the children: mixing mud is not easy, building a house is even more difficult. Fensiting Kindergarten educates children in these ways, so that the children love labor, understand that the fruits of labor are not easy to create, and thus understand that they should respect working people.

　　北京分司厅幼稚园的劳动教育
    本报记者  穆扬
    北京市立分司厅幼稚园的教师们，在解放后经过一个时期学习，开始接受了新的教育观点，在儿童的日常生活与游戏中，随时进行爱劳动的教育，改变孩子们已往轻视劳动的风气。
    去年夏天，该园教师和工友利用校园里原来种花的一块空地，种了玉米和毛豆。成熟的时候，教师们领着儿童们去看他们秋收；也让儿童们帮助摘豆角，掰玉米。回去就煮熟了分给大家吃。儿童们吃着都特别香甜，也特别高兴，便又要求教师再种玉米和毛豆。因季节关系，改种了萝卜和白菜。教师有时领着儿童去作些拣砖头、捉虫、拔草等简单轻松的工作。儿童们干起来也觉很好玩，逐渐成了教师和工友叔叔的小帮手。以后，每当空出一畦地时，儿童们就关心着再种什么。现在虽然放了暑假，但孩子们来校游玩的时候，都站在篱笆外边，关心地望望园里的菜蔬。
    教师们随时注意教育儿童养成尊重劳动人民的观念。有一次，一位摇煤工人正在校园里摇着煤球，儿童们忽然无意识地唱起一支旧儿歌：“你猜猜我是谁？我是一个煤黑子。黑脸蛋，白牙板，坑吃坑吃摇半天。”四岁的陈燕生也喊道：“煤黑子！煤黑子！”教师听到了，觉得这个错误观念需要纠正，就问大家：“他的脸原来就黑吗？”“不，是煤末弄黑的。”许多声音这样回答。教师接着问：“他为什么穿单衣呢？”“他热了。”“为什么热？我们穿着棉衣不是还冷吗？”“他费力气摇煤球呵！”“他给谁摇煤球呵？”“给我们！”大家毫不犹豫地回答。于是教师紧跟着问：“他给咱们摇煤球，咱们应该对他怎样？”陈燕生和唱过歌的儿童们听了小脸红了一下，就跑去向摇煤球的工人道歉，要求叔叔原谅。过后他们不再唱那个旧儿歌，而以教师编的儿歌代替了它：“别看你脸蛋黑，你干的活我不会，又铲土，又挑水，为了大家你真累。”
    过去，教室一直是由女工友来打扫的。可是儿童们大多不注意教室清洁，经常往小凳上踩土，地上乱扔纸屑。教师们便在这学期领导儿童们亲自进行了两次大扫除，让儿童们自己搬小椅子，试着扫扫地，并随时向儿童说明打扫与保持清洁的不容易，教育大家爱护清洁，让扫地的工友大妈，少费点劲。从此教室的清洁情况就好的多了。
    有一次，该园盖房子，许多儿童都围在那里看泥水匠合泥，扔砖。七岁的赵长海逞强地说：“这谁不会呀，我也会合泥！”教师就有意的让他去试试看。他拿着铁铲铲了几下，小脸就涨红了。这时，教师便告诉儿童们：合泥不容易，盖房子更不容易。分司厅幼稚园以这些方式向儿童进行教育，使孩子们爱劳动，懂得劳动成果是不容易创造的，从而懂得了要尊敬劳动人民。
