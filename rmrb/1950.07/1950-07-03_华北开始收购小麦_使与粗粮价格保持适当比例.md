Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th. The North China Grain Company has begun purchasing wheat in some areas. The wheat harvest in most parts of North China is better this year than last year. In June, the amount of wheat entering the market in various places was very large, but there were few buyers, so the price of wheat once fell too much, especially in the areas where wheat was harvested earlier in Pingyuan Province and southern Hebei Province. The various levels of institutions under the North China Grain Company began purchasing in the wheat-producing areas of Pingyuan and Hebei Provinces in mid-June to maintain an appropriate ratio between wheat and coarse grain prices, in order to stabilize market grain prices. For example, after the new wheat in Xinxiang entered the market, the price of wheat once fell to 655 yuan per jin due to small sales. After the grain company purchased it, the price of wheat has steadily risen to more than 700 yuan. The price of new wheat in the Handan area has also risen from 700 yuan per jin to about 800 yuan. Large-scale wheat purchases throughout the region will begin in July.

　　华北开始收购小麦
    使与粗粮价格保持适当比例
    【新华社天津三十日电】华北区粮食公司已在部分地区开始收购小麦。华北一般地区今年小麦收成比去年好。六月内各地小麦上市量很多，而收购者少，故麦价曾一度下落过多，尤以平原省及河北省南部小麦收获较早的地区为甚。华北区粮食公司所属各级机构乃于本月中旬在平原、河北两省产麦地区开始收购，使小麦与粗粮价格之间保持适当比例，以稳定市场粮价。如新乡新麦上市后，因销量较小，麦价曾一度下落到每斤六百五十五元，经粮食公司收购后，麦价已稳步回升到七百元以上；邯郸地区新麦价格亦由每斤七百元回升到八百元左右。全区大规模的小麦收购工作将在七月开始。
