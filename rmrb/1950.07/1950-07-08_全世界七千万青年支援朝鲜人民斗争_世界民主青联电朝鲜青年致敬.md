The World Federation of Democratic Youth demands the immediate withdrawal of American armed forces from Korea and the complete cessation of intervention.

    Finally, the World Federation of Democratic Youth wishes the Korean youth a swift victory in their struggle for the freedom and happiness of the people. This struggle is also a struggle to safeguard world peace.

The association also calls on British youth to write large numbers of letters to the American Embassy, denouncing the US government's aggressive actions and demanding the withdrawal of all American troops in Korea.
