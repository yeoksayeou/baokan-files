　　Jilin City Public Factory Branch's Experience in Guaranteeing and Supervising Production
Since April, the branches of public factories in Jilin City have made progress in guaranteeing and supervising production. In Party meetings, they generally discuss and study the factory's production plan. Many Party members stand at the forefront of the production movement, leading the masses to respond to the call of the Municipal Party Committee to complete production tasks ahead of schedule. Among the 21 public factories in the city, 19 completed and exceeded their production plans in April. The following are some methods and experiences of the factory branches in the city in guaranteeing and supervising production.

First, widely organizing workers to discuss the production plan and transforming the plan into the workers' own actions is the main step in guaranteeing and supervising production, and also the main link in realizing democratic management. Before March, many factory leaders did not have a sufficient understanding of this point and could not transform the administrative plan into a plan of the masses, so that the production plan often failed. In the past, the plan was not discussed by the workers, and the workers felt that how the work was done was like "the seeds growing in the gourd, and they didn't know if they were good or bad." After April, they paid attention to mobilizing workers to discuss the plan, and the workers felt that they had "something to strive for," so their production enthusiasm was improved, and their sense of responsibility for completing the plan was strengthened. The experience gained by Jilin factory branches in mobilizing Party members to unite the masses to discuss the plan is that after discussing the overall production plan, it is necessary to mobilize the workers to formulate a specific production plan for a workshop, a trade union group, or even an individual. The first is to require Party members to plan what they need to do individually to complete the production task, in order to motivate the masses. The second is to formulate contracts so that the production of various departments is closely linked and supervised each other to ensure that the plan does not fail. At the same time, the branch should urge the administration to promptly solve various problems suggested by workers to complete the plan that must be solved and can be solved, and often check the implementation of the plan; launch a struggle against various unserious attitudes towards the plan to ensure the realization of the production plan.

Secondly, frequently understanding and studying the main obstacles in completing and exceeding the production tasks, and solving the key problems in production in a timely manner, is an important issue in guaranteeing and supervising production. When the Fourth-One Factory started production in early April, the average scrap rate of the foundry department reached 47.6%; the scrap rate of individual groups even reached 85%. After the factory's general branch committee discovered this phenomenon, it focused on the foundry department, cultivating typical production groups to improve quality and promote the overall situation, so that the scrap rate was reduced to 12.08%. When the branch studies and solves the key problems hindering production, on the one hand, it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of workers relying on the administration to push problems as much as possible; on the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the bureaucratic style of the administration not solving problems and letting the lower levels "overcome" and "guarantee" as much as possible; the administration should be organized and mobilized to work with the workers to find ways together and work together to solve the key problems hindering production.

Thirdly, to guarantee and supervise production, it is also necessary to grasp the ideological trends of the masses at any time and place, and carry out education in a timely manner to make them adapt to the requirements of production tasks. In the past, when the Jilin Paper Mill discussed the plan, the administration did not solve the problems after the workers put forward their opinions, so the workers said, "When we discuss the plan, they say they can complete it, but whether it can be completed will be discussed later." As a result, the production plans from January to April were not realized. In May, the branch conducted in-depth publicity and education, and the administration also expressed that problems that could be solved would be solved in a timely manner. The enthusiasm of the workers for discussing the plan was therefore improved, and they put forward more than 130 rationalization proposals, so that the monthly task was completed eight days ahead of schedule. The branch should also combine temporary publicity and mobilization work with regular ideological education, so that various erroneous ideas can be corrected in a timely manner, and advanced ideas that promote production can be promoted in a timely manner. The branch must also do a good job in the publicity and mobilization work of the workshop, and enable Party members and non-Party masses to unite and cooperate, put forward rationalization proposals, and launch challenges and competitions.

Fourthly, the branch must also struggle for improving production technology, improving production quality, and reducing costs. To this end, the branch should first pay attention to recruiting veteran technical workers into the Party, and select Party members who are familiar with technology and economic work to participate in the Party's leading bodies (general branch committee or branch committee), so that the factory branch becomes a strong leading core with members who master advanced technology and decide the factory's production work. Sixteen of the 76 technical workers in the foundry department of the Fourth-One Factory are Party members; four of the five branch committee members are technical workers. This situation has played a significant role in the branch's work of eliminating defective products and ensuring the realization of the production plan. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the unity between Party members and non-Party technical personnel, and be good at uniting non-Party technical personnel around the branch. Some of the older technical workers have a heavy simple technical viewpoint and are slow to accept new things. In addition to encouraging them to further master and master technology, the branch must also patiently conduct political and ideological education for them, and unite them to work together to realize the production plan. Furthermore, Party members and workers must be organized to carry out technical learning frequently. Generally, technical seminars, meetings of advanced producers, etc. can be used to invite advanced technical personnel or advanced producers to make reports, exchange and disseminate production experience, or the trade union can organize amateur research classes. It is also possible to improve the technical level of apprentices through the signing of master-apprentice contracts. Finally, the branch must also put the work of promoting a large number of worker cadres on the agenda, assist the factory administration in formulating a plan for training worker cadres, carefully select advanced workers in production, and boldly promote them to participate in production leadership and factory management. In the work, give them more specific help, so that they gradually take on the responsibility of leading economic construction.

Fifthly, the branch must struggle for the establishment and consolidation of production discipline and the implementation of the production responsibility system. The results of the security inspection of the five main public factories in Jilin City show that the lack of responsibility in the factory management system and the laxity of production discipline are the biggest obstacles to the current development of factory production; most of the industrial injuries are caused by inadequate mechanical safety equipment. To this end, the branch should do the following: 1. Educate workers with specific examples in production, establish and enhance their concept of cherishing state property, make them realize the necessity of establishing a production responsibility system, and take the initiative to fight for the elimination of the phenomenon of no one being responsible. 2. Mobilize Party members to unite the masses and conduct mass inspections and supervision of the important links in factory production and construction. Pay attention to reflecting the management of security, machinery, boilers, electrical and other departments, and often study with workshop directors, technicians, and technical workers to improve the above-mentioned situation. And suggest to the administration to improve it. 3. Lead the trade union and help the administration to formulate various responsibility systems and regulations that are beneficial to production, such as the handover system, the mechanical use responsibility system, and the technical operation regulations. And educate workers, especially Party members, to strictly guarantee the implementation of various systems and regulations.

Sixth, the branch must grasp the key points, cultivate typical examples, and be good at grasping the key issues in production, personally cultivate a workshop and a group to promote the general. In order to reduce defective products and reverse the phenomenon of poor quality, the branch of the foundry department of the Fourth-One Factory concentrated its efforts to help the Liu Zhengde group create a new record of improving quality, thereby promoting the entire factory and greatly reducing defective products.

In addition, the branch must pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the trade union and the Youth League, opposing both laissez-faire and acting as a substitute. And strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses. Progressive workers and Youth League members should be voluntarily admitted to the general meeting of the Party to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses. The factory director and other administrative leaders, if they are Party members, must often participate in Party meetings and report on the production situation and existing problems to the Party committee or the Party members' meeting on a regular basis; and listen to Party members' opinions on improving administrative management. At the same time, the branch should pay attention to implementing the meeting budget system to avoid dispersing forces and affecting work.

　　吉林市公营工厂支部保证和监督生产的经验
    吉林市各公营工厂支部，自四月份以来，对生产的保证和监督工作已有进步。在党的会议上，一般的都能讨论与研究工厂的生产计划。不少党员站在生产运动的前列，带动群众响应市委提前完成生产任务的号召。该市二十一个公营工厂中，四月份就有十九个工厂按时完成并超过了生产计划。下面就是该市各工厂支部在保证和监督生产方面的一些方法和经验。
    首先，广泛组织职工讨论生产计划，把计划变为工人自己的行动，是保证和监督生产的主要步骤，也是实现管理民主化的主要环节。三月份以前，不少工厂的负责同志对这一点认识不足，不能把行政上的计划变成群众的计划，以致生产计划常常落空。过去计划不经工人讨论，工人认为工作作的怎样像“籽长在葫芦里，成秕不知道”。四月份以后注意发动工人讨论计划，工人就感到有“奔头”，因而生产积极性提高了，完成计划的责任心加强了。吉林各工厂支部在发动党员团结群众讨论计划中，得出的经验是：在讨论总的生产计划之后，必须动员工人群众制定一个车间、一个工会小组的甚至个人的具体生产计划。第一是要求党员计划出个人为完成生产任务所要作的事情，以带动群众。第二是要制订合同，使各部门生产紧密衔接、互相监督，保证计划不落空。支部同时要督促行政上去及时解决工人为完成计划所建议的各种必须解决与可能解决的问题，并经常检查执行计划的情况；向各种对待计划的不严肃的态度展开斗争，保证生产计划的实现。
    其次，经常了解和研究完成与超过生产任务中的主要障碍，并及时解决生产中的关键问题，是保证和监督生产中的一个重要问题。四一厂四月初旬开始生产时，铸造部废品平均率达百分之四十七点六；个别组废品率竟达百分之八十五。该厂总支委发现这一现象后，即以铸造部为重点，培养典型生产组提高质量，推动全面，使废品率减低到百分之一二点零八。支部研究与解决阻碍生产的关键问题时，一方面要防止职工有问题尽量向行政上推的依赖现象；另一方面也要反对行政上不解决问题，尽让下边“克服”“保证”的官僚主义作风；应该组织动员行政上同职工群众共同想办法，上下一致努力，解决阻碍生产的关键问题。
    第三，保证和监督生产，还须随时随地掌握群众思想动态，及时进行教育，使之适应生产任务的要求。吉林造纸厂，过去讨论计划时，工人提出意见后行政上不解决，因此工人就说：“让我们讨论计划时，就说能完成，究竟能不能完成以后再说。”致使一月份至四月份的生产计划，均未实现。五月份，支部就深入宣传教育，行政上又表示能解决的问题一定及时解决。工人讨论计划的积极性因此提高，就提出了一百三十多条合理化建议，从而使全月任务提前八天完成。支部还应将临时的宣传鼓动工作和经常的思想教育工作相结合，使各种错误思想得以及时纠正，推动生产的先进的思想得以及时发扬。支部还须作好车间的宣传鼓动工作，并使党员与非党群众团结合作，提出合理化建议，发动挑战竞赛等。
    第四，支部并要经常为改进生产技术，提高生产质量，减低成本而斗争。为此，支部首先要注意吸收老技术工人入党，并选拔党内熟习技术、经济工作的人员参加党的领导机构（总支委员会或支委会），使工厂支部成为拥有掌握先进技术的、决定工厂生产工作的成员的坚强领导核心。四一厂铸造部七十六个技术工人中有十六名是党员；五个支委中有四个是技术工人。这一情况对该支部在消灭废品、保证实现生产计划的工作上，起了重大作用。其次要加强党员与非党技术人员的团结，要善于把非党技术人员团结在支部的周围。技术工人中有些年纪较老的，单纯技术观点重，接受新的事物慢。支部除鼓励他们进一步精通与掌握技术外，还必须耐心对他们进行政治思想教育，团结他们为实现生产计划而共同奋斗。再就是要经常地组织党员与工人群众进行技术学习。一般的可用技术座谈会、先进生产者会议等形式，请先进技术人员或先进生产者作报告，交换与传播生产经验，或通过工会举办业余研究班。还可通过订立师徒合同，提高学徒的技术水平。最后，支部还须把大量提拔工人干部的工作提到工作日程上来，协助工厂行政制订培养工人干部的计划，认真挑选生产中的先进工人，大胆提拔他们参加生产领导及工厂管理工作。在工作中对他们多做具体帮助，使他们逐渐担负起领导经济建设的责任。
    第五，支部要为建立与巩固生产纪律、贯彻生产责任制而斗争。吉林市五个主要公营工厂的保安检查的结果，说明工厂管理制度上的无人负责和生产纪律松懈，是目前工厂生产向前发展的最大障碍；公伤事故多数是由于机械保安设备不周而引起。为此支部应做到：一、以生产中的具体事例教育职工，树立并增强其爱护国家财产观念，使他们认识建立生产责任制的必要，主动的为消灭无人负责现象而斗争。二、发动党员团结群众，对工厂生产与修建方面的重要环节，进行群众性的检查与监督。要注意反映保安、机械、锅炉、电气等部门的管理情况，与车间主任、技师、技术工人经常研究改进上述情况的办法。并向行政建议，加以改进。三、领导工会、帮助行政上制订有益于生产的各种责任制度与规程，如交接班制度，机械使用专责制、技术操作规程等。并教育职工，特别是党员，严格保证各种制度、规程的贯彻。
    第六，支部要掌握重点，培养典型，要善于抓住生产中的关键问题，亲自培养一个车间、一个小组，以推动一般。四一厂铸造部支部，为了减少废品，扭转质量太差的现象，就集中力量帮助刘正德小组，创造出提高质量的新纪录，因而推动全厂，废品大大减少。
    此外，支部必须注意加强对工会和青年团的领导，既反对放任自流，也反对包办代替。并加强党与群众联系。党的一般会议要吸收进步的工人与青年团员自愿参加，以密切党群关系。厂长及其他行政负责同志，如系党员，必须经常参加党的会议，按期向党的委员会，或党员大会报告生产情况及存在的问题；并倾听党员对改进行政管理工作的意见。同时支部要注意实行会议预算制度，以免分散力量，影响工作。
