Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The United Nations Security Council, controlled by American imperialism, held its fourth illegal meeting on the Korean issue on the 7th. In the absence of representatives from the Soviet Union and New China, it continued to unilaterally and illegally pass a "resolution" that thoroughly defiled the United Nations. Only six votes favored the "resolution," including the United States, Britain, France, Norway, Cuba, and Ecuador. India, Egypt, and others abstained. The main points of the proposal were as follows: (1) To authorize US imperialism to "command" the interventionist forces of various countries invading Korea; (2) To have the United States appoint the commander-in-chief to "command" these interventionist forces; (3) To authorize these bandit troops to fight under the blue and white flag of the United Nations.

The proposal was initiated by the representatives of Britain and France under the instigation of the United States. According to US representative Austin, the United States was reluctant to "preside over this new proposal" because "under this proposal, the United States would bear special responsibilities." But in reality, the first two items of the Security Council's so-called "new proposal" merely ratified the shameful fait accompli, namely that the naval and air forces of the British and Australian interventionist forces had long been under the "command" of the United States, participating in the massacre of the Korean people fighting for independence and unification.

After the Security Council passed the above-mentioned illegal resolution, US President Truman appointed MacArthur as the commander-in-chief of the so-called "United Nations forces" invading Korea on the 8th. And Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was originally responsible for ensuring strict compliance with the United Nations Charter, obediently played the role of helping US imperialism greatly undermine the United Nations Charter. After the Security Council meeting on the 7th, Lie "handed a United Nations flag to the US Chief Representative Austin, hoping that it would be raised at MacArthur's headquarters" (Agence France-Presse). This stained the solemn United Nations flag with the blood of imperialist bandits massacring the Korean people.

After holding two illegal meetings on the Korean issue on June 25th and 27th, the Security Council held a third illegal meeting on the 30th. The convening of this meeting was specifically to make the representatives of India and Egypt, who abstained during the voting at the second meeting, express their attitudes again. At the meeting, India agreed to the resolution on armed intervention in Korea illegally passed by the Security Council at the second meeting, while Egypt still expressed "abstention."

　　美帝继续玷污联合国！
    安理会又非法通过决议授权美国“统率”干涉军
    赖伊恭顺地充当了美帝的帮凶
    【新华社九日讯】美帝国主义把持下的联合国安全理事会，于七日举行对朝鲜问题的第四次非法会议，在苏联和新中国代表没有出席的情况下，继续片面地、非法地通过了彻底玷污联合国的“决议”。赞成该“决议”的只有美国、英国、法国、挪威、古巴和厄瓜多尔等六票，印度、埃及等都弃权。该议案的主要部分有下列三点：（一）授权美帝国主义“统率”侵略朝鲜的各国干涉军；（二）由美国任命“统率”这批干涉军的总司令；（三）授权这批强盗军队使用联合国的蓝白旗作战。
    该案系由美国策动英法两国代表所提出。据美国代表奥斯汀说：美国之所以不便“主持这一新提案”，是“因为根据这个提案，美国要负特殊的责任”。但实际上安理会的这个所谓“新提案”的前两项，只是批准了可耻的既成事实，即英澳干涉军的海空部队，早已在美国的“统率”之下，参加屠杀为独立与统一而斗争的朝鲜人民了。
    在安理会通过上述非法决议后，美国总统杜鲁门已于八日任命麦克阿瑟为侵略朝鲜的所谓“联合国部队”的总司令。而本来负有保证严格遵守联合国宪章的职责的联合国秘书长赖伊，又恭顺地扮演了帮助美帝国主义大大破坏联合国宪章的角色。赖伊在七日安理会会议后，“将一面联合国旗帜授与美国首席代表奥斯汀，希望它在麦克阿瑟总部升起”（法新社）。这就使庄严的联合国旗帜沾上了帝国主义强盗们屠杀朝鲜人民的血腥。
    安理会于六月二十五与二十七日举行对朝鲜问题的两次非法会议后，曾于三十日举行第三次非法会议，该次会议的召开，专为使在二次会议表决时弃权的印度与埃及代表重新表示态度。会上印度同意了安理会二次会议非法通过的武装干涉朝鲜的决议，埃及则仍表示“弃权”。
