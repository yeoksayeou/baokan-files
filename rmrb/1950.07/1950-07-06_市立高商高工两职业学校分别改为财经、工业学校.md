　　Two Municipal Senior Vocational Schools of Commerce and Industry Changed to Schools of Finance and Economics, and Industry Respectively
　　[This newspaper reports] In order to meet the needs of national economic construction, the former Municipal Senior Commercial School has been ordered to be renamed the Municipal School of Finance and Economics. The Senior Commercial School has a history of thirty-one years. After liberation, under the leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, reactionary educational courses were abolished, teaching equipment was enriched, and teachers and students have made great progress in teaching. In order to train more economic construction talents, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education merged the original accounting and banking departments of the school into an accounting department, and added statistics and business administration departments; it was renamed the "Municipal School of Finance and Economics." The school system is still equivalent to high school level, and graduation takes three years. Each of the three departments will recruit 100 new students during the summer vacation this year.

　　市立高商高工两职业学校分别改为财经、工业学校
    【本报讯】为了适应国家经济建设的需要，本市原高级商业学校奉命改为市立财经学校。高商已有三十一年的历史。解放后，在市文教局的领导下，废除了反动的教育课程，充实了教学设备，师生在教学上都有了很大进步。市文教局为了培养更多的经济建设人材，把该校原有会计、银行二科合并为会计科，又增设统计、工商管理两科；易名为“市立财经学校”。该校学制仍相当于高中程度，三年毕业。今年暑期三科各招新生一百名。（王明）
    【又讯】北京市立高级工业职业学校，接文教局指示，自二十四日起改名为“北京市市立工业学校”。（林华）
