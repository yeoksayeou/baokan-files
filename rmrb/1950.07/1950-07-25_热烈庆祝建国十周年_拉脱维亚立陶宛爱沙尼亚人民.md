　　Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: According to TASS reports: The three Soviet republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, respectively celebrated the 10th anniversary of their founding on the 21st.

　　In Riga, the capital of Latvia, the dawn was filled with joyful songs. Residents wrote the inscription "1940-1950" on their houses to commemorate this great decade. Three hundred and fifty thousand working people, dressed in festive attire, participated in the celebratory parade. They carried portraits of Marshal Stalin decorated with flowers, held up banners reporting production achievements, and also carried trains, turbines, and electric motors that Latvia had never manufactured before.

　　In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, more than 100,000 people participated in the celebration procession. Workers paraded with models of items that Lithuania had never manufactured before, and cars loaded with electric motors, precision instruments, construction machinery, and agricultural machinery moved slowly. Collective farmers came especially to participate, because 75 percent of the farmers in Lithuania have already joined collective farms and embarked on the road to a prosperous life. The parade procession was filled with bouquets of flowers, folk songs and music. On many raised flags were written: "Defend Peace!" "No Intervention in Korea!" "Long Live the Freedom-Loving Korean People!"

　　In Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, more than 150,000 working people participated in the celebration parade. As people in colorful clothes and holding bouquets cheered and marched forward, the square turned into a huge, moving flower bed. People in the parade held charts, models and specimens of various products. Tallinn's industry has now exceeded pre-war production levels several times over, and dozens of enterprises have already completed their five-year plans ahead of schedule.

　　Throughout the cities and villages of the three republics, people were immersed in happy joy all day long.

　　热烈庆祝建国十周年
    拉脱维亚立陶宛爱沙尼亚人民
    【新华社二十四日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚三加盟共和国，于二十一日分别庆祝它们建国的十周年纪念。
    在拉脱维亚首都里加，天一破晓就充满了愉快的歌声。居民在房屋上写上“一九四○——一九五○”的字样，纪念这伟大的十年。三十五万劳动人民，穿着节日盛装参加庆祝游行。他们抬着用鲜花装饰的斯大林大元帅的像，举着报告生产成绩的标语，还携带着拉脱维亚从未制造过的火车，透平和电力马达等。
    在立陶宛的首都维尔那，有十万余人参加庆祝典礼的行列。工人携带着立陶宛从未制造过的物品的模型游行，装着电力马达、精确仪器、建筑机器和农业机器的汽车缓缓行进。集体农民们特别赶来参加，因为全立陶宛已有百分之七十五的农民参加了集体农场，走上了富裕生活的道路。游行行列中到处是一束束的鲜花，到处是民歌和乐声。在许多高举的旗帜上面写着：“拥护和平！”“不准干涉朝鲜！”“爱好自由的朝鲜人民万岁！”
    在爱沙尼亚的首都塔林，有十五万余劳动人民参加庆祝游行。当穿着色彩衣服和手持花束的人们欢呼行进时，广场变成了一座庞大的活动花床。游行的人们手持图表、模型和各种生产品的标本。塔林的工业现已超过战前生产水平数倍，几十个企业已经提早完成了五年计划。
    在三个共和国的城乡各地，人民整天都浸沉在幸福的欢乐中。
