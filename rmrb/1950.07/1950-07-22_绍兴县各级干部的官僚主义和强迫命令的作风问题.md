　　The Problem of Bureaucracy and Coercive Commandism of Cadres at All Levels in Shaoxing County
    Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Inspection Team
    In order to promptly discover and correct the bureaucratic and coercive commandist work styles of leaders at all levels, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee sent an inspection team to examine the work of Shaoxing County. This revealed serious problems of bureaucratic and coercive commandist work styles of the county's leadership that were divorced from the masses. This leadership method of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee is good. Formulating work plans and issuing decisions and instructions by leading organs are only part of leadership work, not the entirety of it. Therefore, thorough inspections must be conducted. Stalin taught us: "Correctly organizing the examination of implementation is of decisive significance in the struggle against bureaucracy and red tape." At the same time, this kind of inspection is not only necessary today, when the Party Central Committee has called on the entire Party to strictly rectify its work style, but more importantly, it should be made a regular part of our work. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "For us, constantly reviewing our work, promoting a democratic work style in these reviews, not fearing criticism and self-criticism, and implementing 'say all you know, say it without reservation,' 'those who speak are not to be blamed, and those who hear it should take it as a warning,' and 'correct mistakes if you have made them, and guard against them if you have not,' these beneficial maxims of the Chinese people are the only effective method for resisting the political microorganisms of errors and shortcomings that erode the thinking of our comrades and the body of our Party." ("On Coalition Government")
                                          ——Editor
    In mid-June, we went to the Shaoxing Prefectural Committee area to inspect the work of Shaoxing County and found that there were several serious problems in the leadership work style and cadre work style of the county:
    I. There is a relatively serious bureaucratic work style in the leadership.
    This summer, after the County Party Committee received instructions from the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office to make production the central task, it routinely wrote a written instruction and sent it to the District Committees, assuming that the problem had been completely solved and that the cadres below would follow the instructions and act accordingly. In reality, the situation below was completely different: Luo Yisheng, a cadre in the Zhenting Township of Keqiao District (the district government's industrial affairs officer), wrote in his notes from the district-wide cadre meeting that the following eleven tasks had to be completed in June: 1. Production and disaster relief; 2. Summer plowing and rice transplanting; 3. Solving the labor difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers; 4. Clearing outstanding debts; 5. Universal registration of land and combining it with anti-black land work; 6. Consolidating organizations; 7. Cultivating activists; 8. Organizing women and children; 9. Universally organizing mutual aid teams; 10. Establishing farmers' correspondence groups; 11. Mobilizing more than 80 percent of farmers to participate in the peace signature campaign before June 5th. When District Party Committee secretaries arranged work, they only raised questions and did not explain work methods; and district and township cadres did not proceed from the demands of the masses and did not know how to combine other work with the central task. After returning from the meeting in the district, the township cadres, right in the middle of the busy farming season, mechanically arranged the order of work according to the deadlines for completing tasks: first, arranging the peace signature campaign, which took three or four days; then arranging the registration of land and combining it with anti-black land work. At that time, what the masses urgently wanted to solve were problems such as plowing, transplanting rice seedlings, draught cattle, and labor. The district and township leadership turned a blind eye to this, put it on the back burner, and did not solve it properly. The so-called "making production the central task" became "empty talk on paper."
    Let's take a look at the situation of this year's fish pond fish farming plan in the county: Shaoxing Prefecture produced 3.6 million catties of fish last year. This year, the Commissioner's Office, at the joint meeting of county heads of the Commissioner's Office, required that production be guaranteed to increase by 20 percent. The county heads all expressed confidence in completing the task. Shaoxing has the most fish ponds in the prefecture, and the Commissioner's Office gave them the task of 2.6 million catties, and asked them to strive for 3 million catties. The county head of Shaoxing agreed to this task. The County Party Committee also knew about this. But what was the actual situation? The number of fish farmed in Shaoxing fish ponds this year was greatly reduced compared to last year. Some districts even had half of their fish ponds not farmed, and even the better districts had one-third of their fish ponds not farmed. When Keqiao District reported to the county government, it said that nine-tenths of the fish ponds in the district had been stocked with fish fry this year. In fact, half of the fish ponds in the district were not farmed. The county did not seriously check and believed it to be true, and blindly expressed confidence in completing the fish farming plan. According to our understanding, there are a total of twelve fish ponds in Kaiting Township in the district, only three ponds were stocked with fish fry, and the number of fish was also greatly reduced; three fish ponds farmed 76,000 fish last year, and only 36,000 this year. According to Luo Yisheng, the district industrial affairs officer, at the fish farmers' forum, the fish farmers reported that half of the fish ponds had not been stocked with fish fry this year, and the number of fish in the stocked ponds was generally reduced. In addition, according to incomplete statistics from five districts in the county (materials from the Aquatic Products Section): Mashan District farmed 1,136 mu last year, and 420 mu this year; Dongguan District farmed 1,120 mu last year, and 600 mu this year; half of the fish ponds in Keqiao District were not farmed; Dongpu District had 88 fish ponds, and 27 fish ponds were farmed this year; Jinhua District farmed 75 fish ponds last year, and 69 fish ponds were farmed this year (some fish fry can still be restocked in summer). How can such a bureaucratic leadership method guarantee the completion of this year's fish pond production increase plan?!
    Since the Second Provincial Party Congress, because of the emphasis on enriching and building departmental work, the main responsible cadres of the Prefectural and County Party Committees have not regularly rotated to the grassroots to inspect and help with work, but only sat in the organs to listen to reports from below. The result of using this method to guide work is that problems are not discovered and solved in a timely manner, and district and township cadres are easily lost in their work and cannot grasp the center.
    District cadres have two opinions about the county leadership: First, when lower-level cadres repeatedly request instructions on a problem three or four times, the county leadership delays solving it, which greatly affects the work. Second, the county sends too many survey forms to the districts. The various departments of the County Party Committee and the various sections of the County Government issued fifty or sixty kinds of forms in April and May alone. The district cadres reflected that even if all the district cadres were to specialize in survey and research work, they would not be able to complete this task (the provincial leadership should also solve this problem).
    When we interviewed the masses, they reflected: "In the past, many comrades, such as Comrade Yang and Comrade Zhang, we talked to them about many things, and they wrote them all down with steel pens, but they left without handling a single thing." The peasants have many opinions about certain village cadres, but they are not willing to raise them yet, and request that a mass meeting be held so that everyone can express their opinions.
    II. The main shortcoming of the work style of district and township cadres is coercive commandism.
    Not to mention the coercive commandism in suppressing bandits and collecting grain, the district and township cadres also showed a serious commandist work style in leading production. For example, Luo Yisheng, a cadre in the Zhenting Township of Keqiao District, at a meeting of fish farmers in the district, asked each fish farmer to sign and stamp a guarantee to the district government, guaranteeing the completion of the task of increasing production by 20 percent in each fish pond this year, and it would not be acceptable not to complete it. The same was true in the establishment of mutual aid teams. The district cadres of the township convened a meeting of cadres above the level of agricultural association team leaders in each village. At the meeting, Luo Yisheng and another cadre talked a lot about the benefits of mutual aid teams, and then proposed that each team sign and stamp a guarantee, guaranteeing that mutual aid teams would be established in all villages in the township within ten days.
    In addition, there were also violations of policies. For example, in the sixth, seventh, and eighth villages of Zhuojin Township in Dongpu District, a cadre from our work team, in order to solve the difficulties of unemployed hired laborers, organized a mutual aid team of more than 50 people. Every night, the mutual aid team convened a meeting of local landlords and rich peasants, forcibly assigning the hired laborers to work in the homes of the landlords and rich peasants. The wages were the same as last year and could not be reduced. One rich peasant did not attend the meeting one night and was fined two dou of soybeans. Moreover, the phenomenon of corruption and embezzlement was also quite serious.
    The above-mentioned serious bureaucratic work style and coercive commandist work style have already aroused a lot of dissatisfaction among the local masses with the Party and the government. This situation must be corrected quickly.

　　绍兴县各级干部的官僚主义和强迫命令的作风问题
    浙江省委巡视组
    浙江省委为及时发现与纠正各级领导上的官僚主义与强迫命令作风，曾派出巡视组检查了绍兴县的工作。从而发现了该县领导上的严重的脱离群众的官僚主义与强迫命令作风。浙江省委的这种领导方法是好的。各级领导机关，制定工作计划，发布决定，指示，只是领导工作的一部分，而不是领导者的全部工作。因此必须作深入的检查。斯大林教导我们：“正确组织执行情形的审查这件事情，在与官僚主义及文牍主义作斗争的事业上，具有决定的意义。”同时，这种检查不仅在今天党中央已号召全党严格整顿全党作风时需要进行，而且更重要的是应该把它作为经常工作之一。毛主席一再教导我们说：“对于我们，经常地检讨工作，在检讨中推广民主作风，不惧怕批评与自我批评，实行‘知无不言，言无不尽’，‘言者无罪，闻者足戒’，‘有则改之，无则加勉’，这些中国人民的有益的格言，正是抵抗错误、缺点这类政治微生物侵蚀我们同志的思想与我们党的肌体的唯一有效的方法。”（《论联合政府》）
                                          ——编者
    我们在六月中到绍兴地委区检查了绍兴县的工作，发现该县领导作风和干部作风中存在着若干严重问题：
    一、领导上存在着比较严重的官僚主义作风
    今夏，县委在地委、专署指示以生产为中心工作后，便照例地写了一个书面指示发给各区委，就此认为问题已经全部解决了，下面干部就会跟着指示而行动起来了。实际上下面完全是另外一种情况：柯桥区赭亭乡区干部骆益生（区政府实业干事）在全区干部会上的记录里，写着六月份要做以下十一项工作：一、生产救灾；二、夏耕插秧；三、解决烈、军、工属劳动力困难；四、扫清尾欠；五、普遍登记田亩，并结合反黑地工作；六、整理组织；七、培养积极分子；八、组织妇女儿童；九、普遍组织变工组；十、成立农民通讯小组；十一、六月五日前发动百分之八十以上农民参加和平签名运动。各区区委书记布置工作时，只提问题，不讲工作办法；而区乡干部不从群众要求出发，不会结合中心工作进行其他工作。该乡乡干部从区里开会回来后，正值农忙，但他们却机械地根据任务完成的限期，排列了工作顺序：第一，布置和平签名运动，忙了三四天；接着布置登记田亩和结合反黑地。而当时群众迫切要求解决的却是耕田、插秧、耕牛、劳动力等问题。区乡领导上对此却熟视无睹，置之高阁，而不去好好解决。所谓“以生产为中心工作”也就成了“纸上空谈”。
    再看一下今年该县鱼塘养鱼计划的情况：绍兴专区去年产鱼三百六十万斤。今年专署在该专署的县长联席会议上，要求保证增产二成。各县县长都表示有信心完成。该专区的鱼塘以绍兴为最多，专署给他们的任务是二百六十万斤，并要他们向三百万斤的方向努力。绍兴县长答应了这个任务。县委也知道这件事情。而实际情况是怎样的呢？今年绍兴鱼塘养鱼数量较去年大为减少。有的区甚至有二分之一的鱼塘未养鱼，较好的区也有三分之一的鱼塘未养鱼。柯桥区在向县政府报告时，说今年鱼塘已下鱼秧十分之九。实际上，该区有一半鱼塘未养鱼。县里也不认真检查就信以为真，还盲目地表示有信心完成养鱼计划。据我们了解，该区开亭乡共有十二个鱼塘，下鱼秧的只三个塘，而鱼数也大大减少；三个鱼塘去年养七万六千条，今年只养三万六千条。据区实业干事骆益生谈，召开鱼户座谈会时，鱼户自报今年尚有二分之一鱼塘未下鱼秧，下鱼秧的塘一般鱼量也均减少。另外，据该县五个区的不完全统计（水产科材料）：马山区去年养一千一百三十六亩，今年养四百二十亩；东关区去年养一千一百二十亩，今年养六百亩；柯桥区一半鱼塘未养鱼，东浦区八十八个鱼塘，今年养二十七个鱼塘；进化区去年养七十五个鱼塘，今年养六十九个鱼塘（夏天还可以补养一部分鱼秧）。不知道这样的官僚主义的领导方法，如何能保证今年鱼塘增产计划的完成？！
    自第二次省党代表会议后，因为强调充实与建设部门工作，地委县委主要负责干部就不经常轮流到下面去检查帮助工作，而只坐在机关里听下面汇报。采用这种办法指导工作的结果是：发现问题、解决问题不及时，区乡干部在工作中容易迷失方向，抓不住中心。
    区干部对县领导上就有两个意见：第一，下面干部对一个问题连续请示三、四次，县领导上拖延不解决，影响工作很大。第二，县里发给区的调查表格太多，县委各部门、县府各科，四、五两个月就发下五、六十种表格。区干部反映说，即便全区干部专门做调查研究工作也完不成这个任务（省委领导上也要解决这一问题）。
    我们访问群众时，群众反映：“过去许多同志，如杨同志、张同志，我们对他们谈了很多的事，他们都用钢笔记下来了，可是没有办一件事就走了。”农民对某些村干部有很多意见，但是现在还不愿提，要求召开群众大会让大家提提意见。
    二、区乡干部工作作风主要缺点是强迫命令
    剿匪征粮中的强迫命令不谈，在领导生产中，区乡干部也表现出严重的命令主义作风。如柯桥区赭亭乡区干部骆益生，在召开全区鱼塘养鱼户会议上，要各鱼户向区政府签名盖章写保证书，保证完成今年各鱼塘增产二成的任务，不完成不行。在成立变工组中也是如此，该乡区干部召开各村农会小组长以上干部会议，会上骆益生和另一个干部讲了一大套变工组的好处，接着就提出要各小组在保证书上签名盖章，保证在十天内把全乡各村变工组都要成立起来。
    此外，并有违反政策的事情，如东浦区濯锦乡六、七、八三个村，我工作组一干部为了解决雇工失业困难，组织了五十余人的变工组，每天晚上由变工组召开当地地主、富农会议，强迫把雇工分配到地主、富农家里去干活。工资与去年一样，不能降低。有一个富农有一天晚上未来参加会议，因此被罚黄豆二斗。而且贪污腐化的现象也相当严重。
    以上这些严重的官僚主义作风与强迫命令作风，已经引起了当地群众对党对政府的很多不满。这种情况必须迅速地加以改正。
