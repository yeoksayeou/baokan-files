　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th (TASS): According to Pyongyang radio, Kim Yak-su, the former Deputy Speaker of the South Korean puppet "National Assembly" who was imprisoned by Syngman Rhee, has been released from prison and issued the following statement:

　　After the American imperialists and their lackey Syngman Rhee held a separate "election" and established a "government," they suppressed all those who fought for the reunification of the fatherland.

　　The Syngman Rhee gang, carrying out the orders of the American imperialists and preparing for a "northern expedition," murdered all those who supported the reunification of the fatherland. Kim Koo, who participated in the joint conference of representatives from North and South Korea, was one of the victims.

　　We thirteen - members of the "National Assembly," were thrown into prison for demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. The so-called "National Assembly", which only follows the orders of the American imperialists, has become a voting machine. The Syngman Rhee gang rejected the proposal of the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front for the peaceful unification of the fatherland and attacked North Korea on June 25th.

　　Kim Yak-su finally called on the members of the South Korean "National Assembly" to switch to the side of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and devote all their energy to the struggle for the democratic unification of Korea.

　　南朝鲜伪“国民议会”前副议长
    号召伪“国民议会”议员转到朝鲜共和国方面来
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社平壤二十五日讯：据平壤广播，被李承晚囚禁的南朝鲜伪“国民议会”的前副议长金若水，已自狱中获释，并发表声明如下：
    美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚在举行单独的“选举”成立了“政府”之后，就镇压一切争取祖国统一的人。
    李承晚匪帮执行美帝国主义者的命令，准备进行“北伐”，杀害了所有拥护祖国统一的人，参加了南北朝鲜代表的联合会议的金九，就是牺牲者之一。
    我们十三个人——“国民议会”的议员，由于要求美军自朝鲜撤退，被投入监牢。唯美帝国主义者之命是从的所谓“国民议会”，已变为表决机器。李承晚匪帮拒绝了祖国统一民主主义战线关于和平统一祖国的建议，并在六月二十五日进攻北朝鲜。
    金若水最后号召南朝鲜“国民议会”的议员们转到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面来，把他们的全副精力都贡献给争取朝鲜民主统一的斗争。
