　　Private Su Lun Yarn Factory Improves Operations
    Past Losses Turn into Present Profits
    Capitalists Send Representatives to Hong Kong to Retrieve Funds and Raw Materials
     [Our Suzhou News] Suzhou's largest yarn factory, the private Su Lun Yarn Factory, has begun to generate profits after labor-management consultations, streamlining its organization, and reducing expenses. In March, the factory suffered significant losses due to its large organization and waste of raw materials. To overcome these difficulties together, labor and management formally signed a labor-management agreement on April 21 after consultations. Workers voluntarily stopped work for twelve days each month, reducing the difficulty of raw cotton shortages; staff also reduced their base salaries by more than 5,300 yuan, saving more than 200 shi of rice each month. At the same time, the factory merged its Shanghai and Wuxi offices and directly purchased raw cotton from cotton-producing areas such as Xi'an and Kaifeng, saving more than 100,000 yuan per dan of raw cotton.
    The factory's daily output per spindle was 0.7 pounds in April and had increased to 0.84 pounds by June. The cost of products has also been greatly reduced. For example, the cost per bolt of 12-pound fine cloth decreased by 14,000 yuan in May compared to April; during the same period, the cost per piece of 20-count yarn also decreased by 20,000 yuan.
    The capitalists were deeply moved after seeing the harmonious labor-management relations and the prospects for business development. They have sent people to Hong Kong to bring back the pre-stored American cotton and some funds, and are also starting to liquidate materials and sell unused items to replenish funds.

　　私营苏纶纱厂改善经营
    过去赔本现在赚钱
    资方派人去香港调回资金和原料
     【本报苏州讯】苏州规模最大的纱厂——私营苏纶纱厂，经过劳资协商、缩减机构、节约开支，开始有了盈余。三月间，该厂由于机构庞大，原料浪费，亏累很大。劳资双方为了共度难关，经过协商于四月二十一日正式签订劳资协议。工人自愿每月停工十二天，减少原棉缺乏的困难；职员也减去底薪五千三百余元，每月节省大米二百多石。同时，该厂把上海、无锡两个办事处裁并；并且直接到西安、开封等产棉区采购原棉，使每担原棉节省了十余万元。
    该厂每锭日产量四月份是零点七磅，到六月份已经增加到零点八四磅。产品成本也减低了很多。如十二磅细布每匹的成本，五月份比四月份减少一万四千元；在同一期间，二十支纱每件的成本也减少了两万元。
    资方看到劳资关系协调和业务发展的前途后，很受感动。已经派人到香港把预存的美棉和一部分资金调回来，并着手清理物资，变卖用不到的东西，充实资金。
