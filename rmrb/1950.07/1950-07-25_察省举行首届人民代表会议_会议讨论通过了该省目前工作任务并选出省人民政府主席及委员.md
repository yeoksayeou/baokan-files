　　Chahar Province Holds First People's Representative Conference
    Conference Discusses and Approves the Province's Current Work Tasks and Elects the Chairman and Members of the Provincial People's Government
    [This newspaper, Chahar News] The first Chahar Province People's Representative Conference was held from the 1st to the 8th of this month. Two hundred and eighty-seven representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors attended. The conference discussed and approved the province's current work tasks, and exercised the functions and powers of the Provincial People's Congress, electing the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Provincial People's Government. The conference also elected Yang Gengtian and 54 others to form the first Chahar Province People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee.

    In a harmonious and solemn atmosphere, the conference reviewed and approved the Provincial People's Government's work report for the past year and more, as well as the general budget for this year's revenue and expenditure. The conference carefully discussed and resolved upon the four work suggestions put forward by Yang Gengtian, the chief representative of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, regarding adjusting industry and commerce, increasing rural production, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, and rectifying the work style of cadres. It unanimously agreed that the current work tasks of the province should focus on strengthening financial and economic work (including industrial and agricultural production and adjusting industry and commerce). Around this central task, efforts should be made to develop culture and education, production and disaster relief, eliminate bandits and special agents, convene people's representative conferences at all levels, and rectify the work style of cadres.

    The conference consistently implemented the spirit of democracy. In Chairman Zhang Su's work report, he frankly pointed out some shortcomings and errors in the work. The representatives, with a serious and responsible attitude, offered criticisms and suggestions on the government's work. On the issue of adjusting industry and commerce and the relationship between public and private sectors, representatives of private entrepreneurs criticized some economic leading departments and some cadres for not paying enough attention to the work of adjusting industry and commerce. Representatives from industry and commerce suggested establishing a unified special consultation organization for adjusting public-private economic relations and formulating guarantee measures for absorbing idle capital. On the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, the representatives unanimously agreed that suppressing bandits and special agents and stabilizing social order are the serious tasks at present. On the issue of rectifying the work style of cadres, specially invited representative Lü Fu suggested resolutely curbing the phenomena of individual cadres infringing upon human rights, property rights, and freedom of marriage, and preventing the errors of "privilege mentality" and "complacency" among some cadres, in order to implement the policies and guidelines.

    Regarding the direction of rural production, the conference criticized the lazy and shiftless thinking of "poverty is glorious" and the agricultural socialist thinking of "eating from the big pot." The conference pointed out that the purpose of the people's revolution is to get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity, and idleness and non-production are the greatest shame. Regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, the conference, on the one hand, criticized the "boundless leniency" bias that occurred in the implementation of policies in some areas in the past, and proposed that it is necessary to step up the elimination of bandits and special agents to stabilize the people's production environment; but on the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent the opposite bias, and the policy of combining suppression and leniency must be implemented.

    The conference received a total of 786 proposals, which were reviewed item by item, sorted, and merged into 119 items. In addition to those submitted to the conference for discussion, the Proposal Review Committee signed and noted the handling opinions for each case belonging to specific implementation or requiring instructions from the Central People's Government, and handed them over to the Provincial People's Government for handling.

    This full democratic spirit was also reflected in the two elections of the conference. The nomination of the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Provincial People's Government, and the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Consultative Committee were all carefully deliberated through extensive consultation and in-depth deliberation, taking into account all aspects. During the official elections, the solemn democratic election was followed according to the election regulations. Therefore, the results of the two elections included representatives from all aspects, with broad representation, thereby consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front and enhancing the great unity of the four classes.

    The representatives attending the conference expressed their deep satisfaction with the democratic spirit of the conference. They said: "We must convey the spirit of the conference to the people and guarantee 100% implementation of the conference's resolutions."

　　察省举行首届人民代表会议
    会议讨论通过了该省目前工作任务并选出省人民政府主席及委员
    【本报察哈尔讯】察哈尔省第一届各界人民代表会议，已于本月一日至八日举行。出席各族各界代表二百八十七人。会议讨论和通过了该省的目前工作任务，并代行省人民代表大会职权，选举了省人民政府主席副主席及委员，会议并选出了杨耕田等五十五人组成省首届各界人民代表会议协商委员会。
    会议在融洽严肃的气氛中，审查并通过了省人民政府关于一年多来的工作报告和本年度财政收支概算。会议对于中国共产党代表团首席代表杨耕田在大会中所提出的关于调整工商业、提高农村生产、镇压反革命活动和整顿干部作风等四项工作的建议，作了缜密讨论后并作出了决议，一致认为本省目前的工作任务，应以加强财政经济工作（包括工农业生产和调整工商业等）为中心，围绕此项中心工作，展开文化教育、生产救灾、肃清土匪特务、开好各级各界人民代表会议以及整顿干部作风等项工作。
    会议自始至终贯彻了民主精神，在张苏主席的工作报告中，坦白指出了工作中的若干缺点和错误；代表们以严肃负责的态度，对政府的工作提出了批评和建议。在调整工商业和公私关系问题上，私营企业家代表批评了某些经济领导部门和某些干部还不够重视调整工商业的工作。工商业界代表建议成立统一的调整公私经济关系的专门协商机构，规定吸收游资的保障办法。在镇压反革命分子问题上，代表一致认为镇压土匪特务，安定社会秩序是当前的严重任务。在整顿干部作风问题上，特邀代表吕复建议切实制止个别干部侵犯人权、财权和婚姻自由权的现象，防止某些干部中的“特权思想”和“居功自傲”的错误，以便贯彻执行施政方针。
    关于农村生产方向问题，会议批判了“穷光荣”的二流子思想和“吃大锅饭”的农业社会主义思想。会议指出：人民革命的目的就是为了摆脱穷困走向富裕，游手好闲不事生产是最大的耻辱。关于镇压反革命活动问题，会议一方面批评了过去某些地区执行政策中发生的“宽大无边”的偏向，提出必须加紧清除土匪特务，以安定人民的生产环境；但另方面也要防止相反的偏向，必须执行镇压与宽大相结合的政策。
    会议共收到提案七百八十六件，经逐件审查，分类整理，合并为一百一十九件。除提交大会讨论者外，提案审查委员会对属于具体执行的或须请示中央人民政府的各案，都一一签注了处理意见，交省人民政府办理。
    这种充分的民主精神，同样表现在会议的两种选举方面。省人民政府主席、副主席、委员和协商委员会主席、副主席、委员两项侯选名单的提出，都经过广泛协商和深入酝酿，作了照顾各方面的慎重斟酌；正式选举时，又根据选举条例，遵行了郑重的民主选举。因此，两项选举的结果，都包括了各方面的代表人物，具有广泛的代表性，从而巩固与扩大了人民民主统一战线，增进了四个阶级的大团结。
    参加会议的代表对大会的民主精神都深表满意，他们表示：“一定把会议的精神传达到人民群众中去，并且保证百分之百的执行会议的决议。”
