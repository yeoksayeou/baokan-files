Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Manila News: Philippine People's Liberation Army Commander Taruc, while at the General Headquarters of the Central Luzon Liberated Area, received Tagalog newspaper "Bagong Buhay" publisher Manañan and said: The United States will surely fail in Korea. He said: The American people "yearn for peace and will not allow warmongers to drag them into war." European imperialist allies are showing a cold attitude towards supporting the United States. The forces struggling to maintain peace under the leadership of the Soviet Union far outweigh the forces pursuing war. Truman and Acheson are both clear that fighting against the Soviet Union and its allies is bound to fail. Therefore, the Korean War will not escalate into a Third World War.
Regarding the current situation in the Philippines, Taruc emphasized that the military and economic aid given by the United States to the Philippine reactionary ruling group is not enough to suppress and prevent the development of the growing national struggle. He also said: The Hukbalahap and the Communist Party are working in unity and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party with バルゴス (Balagtas) as General Secretary.

　　美帝援助菲反动统治集团
    不能阻止菲民族斗争发展
    菲解放军总司令塔鲁克发表谈话
    【新华社七日讯】马尼拉讯：菲律宾人民解放军总司令塔鲁克在其中吕宋解放区总司令部里接见塔加尔文日报《巴拱·布海》报的发行人曼纳罕时说：美国在朝鲜必定失败。他说：美国人民“向往和平，不允许战争贩子们把他们拖入战争”。欧洲帝国主义的同盟者对于支持美国表示冷淡。在苏联领导下为维持和平而斗争的力量远为压倒追逐战争的力量。杜鲁门和艾奇逊都很清楚：对苏联及其盟国作战一定要失败。因此，朝鲜战争不致扩大为第三次世界大战。
    关于菲律宾的目前情势，塔鲁克强调说：美国给菲律宾反动统治集团的军事、经济援助，不足以镇压和阻止日益成长的民族斗争的发展。他又说：民抗军与共产党是在团结一致地工作着，并接受以巴尔哥斯任总书记的共产党的领导。
