Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 16th: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, received a reporter from "Voice of Vietnam" radio station and made the following statement on American intervention in Indochina:

　　Question: How do the American imperialists carry out their intervention in Indochina?

　　Answer: For several years, the American imperialists have been openly interfering in Indochina. For several years, French colonialists, with the financial and military assistance of the United States and under the direction of the United States, have been carrying out their colonial war against Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. However, American imperialism has increasingly exposed its intention to kick out the French colonialists and occupy Indochina itself. The American imperialists are intervening in Indochina more and more openly, and therefore, the contradiction between the French colonialists and the American imperialists is also intensifying day by day.

　　Question: What do you think is the impact of the American imperialists' intervention on the people of Indochina?

　　Answer: American intervention is harmful to the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The American imperialists supply their lackeys with weapons to massacre the people of Indochina. The American imperialists also dump goods here, with the aim of hindering the development of Indochinese industry and handicrafts. They also use money and other means within their power to win over more lackeys and carry out armed conquest of our country.

　　Question: How do we deal with American intervention?

　　Answer: In order to achieve independence, the people of Indochina must eliminate our number one enemy, the French colonialists. At the same time, we must oppose American interference in our internal affairs. The more actively they interfere, the more closely we must unite and the more diligently we must fight. We must clearly expose their aggressive schemes, especially to the people in the French-occupied areas. We must expose and eliminate the lackeys of the American imperialists, who are dividing our people. The united strength of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia will surely be able to eliminate the French colonialists and American interventionists. The American imperialists have been defeated in China. They will also be defeated in Vietnam. We will encounter many difficulties, but we are confident that we will win.

　　对美国干涉印度支那问题
    胡志明发表谈话
    【新华社十七日讯】越南通讯社北越十六日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席接见“越南之声”电台记者，对美国干涉印度支那发表谈话如下：
    问：美国帝国主义者怎样实行其对印度支那的干涉？
    答：几年以来，美帝国主义者一直在公开地干涉印度支那。几年以来，法国殖民主义者以美国的财政、军事上的援助，并在美国的指令之下，进行其对越南、老挝、柬埔寨的殖民战争。不过美帝国主义已日渐暴露其一脚踢出法国殖民主义者，自己来占领印度支那的意图。美帝国主义者越来越公开地干涉印度支那，因此，法国殖民主义者和美帝国主义者之间的矛盾也一天天地加剧起来了。
    问：您认为美帝国主义者的干涉对印度支那人民的影响如何？
    答：美国的干涉对越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民是有害的。美帝国主义者以武器供给他们的走狗，屠杀印度支那人民。美帝国主义并在这里倾销货物，其目的在于阻碍印度支那工业和手工业的发展。他们还用金钱、用他们能力范围内的其他手段，以争取更多的走狗，并实行武装征服我们的国家。
    问：我们如何对付美国的干涉？
    答：为了实现独立，印度支那人民必须消灭我们的第一号敌人法国殖民主义者。同时，我们必须反对美国干涉我们的内政。他们愈是积极干涉，我们也就必须团结得更紧密，奋斗得更加努力。我们必须明明白白地揭露他们的侵略计谋，尤其是向着法占区的人民。我们必须揭露和消灭美帝国主义者的走狗，他们正在分裂我们的人民。越南、老挝、柬埔寨人民联合起来的力量，一定能够消灭法国殖民主义者及美国干涉者。美帝国主义者已在中国遭到失败。他们在越南也将被击败。我们会遇到很多的困难，但是我们确信一定会获得胜利。
