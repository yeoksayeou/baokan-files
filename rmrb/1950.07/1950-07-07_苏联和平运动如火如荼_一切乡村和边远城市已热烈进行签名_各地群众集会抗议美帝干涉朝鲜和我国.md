Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to TASS reports: The Soviet people's movement to defend peace and the activities protesting against U.S. imperialist aggression in Korea have converged into a magnificent torrent.

Mass protest rallies have been held everywhere in Moscow, Leningrad, Riga, Tbilisi, Minsk, and Vladivostok, and across the vast Soviet territory. Workers and peasants, scientists and writers, women and students, all condemned the barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean villages and towns by American planes, and expressed deep sympathy for the Korean people fighting for freedom and independence. At the rallies, people expressed their determination to defend peace, shouting loudly: "No U.S. aggressors interfering in Korea!" "U.S. imperialists get out of Korea!" and other slogans.

The peace signature campaign is developing vigorously. In the Donbas city of Voroshilovgrad, 50,000 residents participated in the peace rally on the 4th. The banners carried by the people were written with angry protests: "Ban interference in Korea and China!" In Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, 600 rallies have been held, and as of the 4th, 300,000 people had signed the peace declaration.

The signature campaign has also been extended to remote cities. In Komsomolsk-on-Amur, in Sakhalin, and in the enterprises and construction sites of the Buryat-Mongol Republic, mass rallies are being enthusiastically held. The signature campaign has also been extended to the sea. Soviet sailors responded to the provocations of the warmongers with unanimous signatures.

Soviet farmers are conducting signature drives in all villages across the country. During the movement, farmers have undertaken new production tasks. Kalachev, a tractor driver in Novoannensky, guaranteed to harvest 57 hectares of grain per day with a "Stalin-6" tractor, which is four times the quota. Cotton planters in Central Asia and grape growers in Transcaucasia have held rallies one after another. All members of the Kirov collective farm in Uzbekistan and other collective farms have signed their names. They guarantee to consolidate the strength of the country with a bumper harvest and strengthen the camp for peace.

    【新华社六日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联人民的保卫和平运动和抗议美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的活动，已汇合成雄壮的洪流。
    在莫斯科、列宁格勒、里加、第比利斯、明斯克和海参崴，在辽阔的苏联国土上，到处都举行了群众抗议大会。工人和农民、科学家和作家、妇女和学生们，一齐谴责美国飞机野蛮轰炸朝鲜的和平村镇，并对进行争取自由和独立的战斗的朝鲜人民寄以深切同情。人们在大会上表示了保卫和平的决心，他们响亮地喊出：“不准美国侵略者干涉朝鲜！”“美帝国主义者滚出朝鲜去！”等口号。
    和平签名的运动，正开展得如火如荼。在顿巴斯的城市伏罗希洛夫格勒，四日有五万居民参加和平大会。人民携带的标语上写着愤怒的抗议：“禁止干涉朝鲜与中国！”在乌克兰的首府基辅，已经举行了六百次大会，截至四日止，已有三十万人在和平宣言上签了名。
    签名运动也推展到边远的城市，在阿穆尔河畔的康索摩尔斯克，在萨哈连，在布利亚蒙古共和国的企业和建筑现场中，正热烈进行着群众大会。签名运动也已推展到海上。苏联海员以一致签名的行动答复了战争贩子的挑衅。
    苏联农民在全国一切乡村内进行签名。在运动中，农民们纷纷承担了新的生产任务。诺佛安年斯克的拖拉机驾驶员卡拉契夫，保证用“斯大林——六”式机每天收割五十七公顷的谷物，即完成定额的四倍。中亚细亚的植棉者和外高加索的葡萄种植者纷纷召开大会。乌兹贝克的基洛夫等集体农场，全体成员都签了名。他们保证以丰收来巩固国家的力量，并加强争取和平的阵营。
