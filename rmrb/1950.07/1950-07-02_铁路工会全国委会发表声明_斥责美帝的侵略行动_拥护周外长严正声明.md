　　Railway Trade Union National Committee Issues Statement
    Condemning US Imperialist Aggression, Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Solemn Statement
    [Report from this newspaper] The National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union issued a statement on June 30th. The full text is as follows:
    In the statement issued by the representative of US imperialism, Truman, on June 27th, he openly ordered the US Air and Naval Forces to provide armed "support" to the troops of the Korean people's traitor, Syngman Rhee. At the same time, he ordered the US Seventh Fleet to "prevent any attack on Taiwan," which is tantamount to ordering the US armed forces to actually occupy a part of Chinese territory. This nakedly exposes the US imperialists' ambition to invade China and Asia, and once again proves that the imperialist war-mongers are irreconcilable with the peace-loving and democratic people of the world.
    This mad and adventurous statement and action by US imperialism, in the eyes of our long-tested Chinese working class and the Chinese people, is merely a desperate struggle by US imperialism under the powerful deterrence of the world's peace and democracy camp, and cannot shake our determination to liberate Taiwan and destroy the last nest of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    We fully support the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou on behalf of the Central People's Government, and we resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and Foreign Minister Zhou with our own practical actions, "People of the whole country and the whole world, unite, make full preparations, and defeat any provocation by US imperialism."
    Our 520,000 railway workers across the country will continue to carry forward the traditional spirit of revolutionary struggle, and together with our worker brothers and the people of the whole country, we will fight to stop the new aggression of the US imperialist robbers in the East and to repel any provocation by US imperialism! At the same time, we warn the war-mongers: the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If anyone dares to launch a new war, what awaits them will be the fate of Hitler and Tojo.

　　铁路工会全国委会发表声明
    斥责美帝的侵略行动  拥护周外长严正声明
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会于六月三十日发表声明，全文如下：
    六月二十七日美帝国主义的代表杜鲁门发表的声明中，公开命令美国空海军给朝鲜人民的叛徒李承晚的军队以武装“支援”。同时并命令美国第七舰队“阻止对台湾的任何进攻”，也就是命令美国武装部队实际占领中国领土的一部分。这赤裸地暴露了美帝国主义妄想侵略中国侵略亚洲的真面目，又一次的证明了帝国主义战争贩子以全世界爱好和平民主的人民是势不两立的。
    美帝国主义这一疯狂的冒险声明和行动，在我们久经锻炼的中国工人阶级和中国人民看来，只不过是美帝在全世界和平民主阵营强大威力震慑下的垂死挣扎，丝毫不能动摇我们解放台湾摧毁美蒋最后巢穴的决心。
    我们完全拥护周外长代表中央人民政府所发表的严正声明，我们坚决以自己的实际行动响应毛主席、周外长的号召，“全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”
    我们全国五十二万铁路职工将继续发扬传统的革命斗争精神，与全国工人兄弟和全国人民一道，为制止美帝国主义强盗在东方的新侵略，击退美帝国主义的任何挑衅而斗争！同时我们警告战争贩子们：中国人民是不可欺侮的。如果有人敢于发动新的战争，等待着它的将是希特勒、东条的命运。
