Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 27th—According to a report from Teletype Agency in Rio de Janeiro: The Brazilian people's mass movement protesting against US aggression in Korea is developing enthusiastically throughout the country. In São Paulo city, the capital of São Paulo province, a huge demonstration was held to protest against the US aggression in Korea. Demonstrators held banners with slogans such as "Oppose US interference in Korea and Brazil" and "Ban atomic bombs," and shouted slogans like "Aggressors get out!" and "We don't want war; we want peace!"
    The Brazilian Workers' Union issued a powerful declaration protesting against US aggression and calling on all Brazilian workers to participate, through their organizations, in the "Worldwide Week of Active Support for the Korean People" initiated by the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Brazilian Organization for the Defense of Peace and Culture issued a protest letter stating: "This aggression is a brutal attack on the basic right to self-determination of all nations, and a blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter. Because the Charter stipulates that the Security Council's resolutions must be agreed upon by all five major powers." The protest letter called on all the Brazilian people to intensify the struggle to win peace and collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. The Federation of Workers' Unions of the Federal District and the Brazilian Women's League also issued strong protests.

    巴和平组织号召加紧和平签名
    【新华社二十七日讯】据电通社里约热内卢讯：巴西人民群众抗议美国侵略朝鲜的运动，正在全国热烈展开中。圣保罗省省会圣保罗城，举行了抗议美国侵略朝鲜的巨大示威游行。示威者手持“反对美国干涉朝鲜和巴西”、“禁止原子弹”等标语；并高呼“侵略者滚出去”和“我们不要战争；我们要和平！”的口号。
    巴西工人联盟发表了有力的宣言，抗议美国的侵略，号召巴西所有工人通过他们的组织，参加世界工联所发起的“全世界积极支援朝鲜人民周”。巴西保卫和平与文化组织发表抗议书称：“这个侵略，是对于各民族的基本自决权利的凶残进攻，罪恶昭彰地违反了国际公法联合国宪章。因为，宪章确定了安理会决议必须经五大国一致同意的原则。”抗议书号召巴西全体人民加紧为争取和平与征集斯德哥尔摩宣言签名而斗争。联邦直属区工人工会和巴西妇女联盟也发出了强烈的抗议。
