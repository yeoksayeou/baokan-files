　　Song of Hikmet
    By Nikola Dorizo
    Translated by Chen Weiming
    The ceiling of the prison is on his head.
    Twelve years of unbearable darkness.
    Spider webs and smoke spread
    Cold and smooth corners.
    The eye of the prison cell,
    looks,
    like a pistol shooting at the sky.
    The vast sky of the motherland is almost non-existent for the prisoner
    Only four steps - the area of the cell.
    Its road - from wall to wall.
    A faint white light penetrates the dark cell.
    Rusty iron bars are nailed to the window,
    canceling out twelve bright years!…
    The ground has been searched empty, and the bed has been stroked,
    so that he cannot hide weapons,
    so that he has no knife to dig holes in the wall,
    and cannot secretly open a path to freedom.
    No weapons!
    No, it still has!
    After all, it cannot be eliminated.
    Poet, your weapon - you carry it with you,
    it's in your chest, it's in your blood!—
    In the long dark night,
    when the executioners have already patrolled past,
    the song of freedom, sharper than a knife,
    erupts from the heart, you can't even see her
    rushing through the narrow window of the cell,
    flying, flying, she flies over the city.
    Far, far, the song reaches far and wide,
    people listen to her in the air.
    She strolls along the distant rivers,
    her campsite—next to the carts,
    resonating through valleys, avenues,
    wandering everywhere on the boots of peasants.
    Someone wants to shoot her—but she lives,
    someone wants to judge her—but she is righteous,
    the road is blocked—but she passes as usual…
    Like language shot by bullets
    people quickly spread it by word of mouth.
    From the southern mountains to the northern forests,
    tens of thousands of voices are even stronger,
    she,
    bypassing the borders of the motherland,
    returns to your prison cell, Hikmet.
    …Thus, your song, the song of victory—
    is she, poet! Liberating you!
    (Translated from the Soviet "Literary Gazette" No. 38)

　　希克梅特之歌
    尼古拉·多里左作
    陈微明译
    在他头上顶着监狱的天花板。
    十二年难以忍受的黑暗。
    蜘蛛网和烟雾一般迷漫了
    冷冰冰又光滑滑的角落。
    牢房里的窗眼，
    看起来，
    好像朝天射击的手枪。
    祖国广阔的天空对囚犯几乎无份
    只有四步——牢房的面积。
    它的道路——从墙壁到墙壁。
    黑洞洞的牢房里透进微弱的白光。
    窗上钉着生锈的铁条，
    勾消了十二个光明的年头！……
    地上搜索一空，床铺也被抚摸过，
    为了使他不能私藏武器，
    为了使他没有刀在墙壁上掘洞，
    不能秘密开辟自由之路。
    没有武器！
    不，它还是有的！
    终究不能把它消灭。
    诗人，你的武器——你就带的有，
    它在胸怀里，它在血液里！——
    到了漫长的黑夜里，
    当刽子手们已经巡查过去，
    自由之歌，比刀更锋利，
    从心坎里迸发，你也看不到她
    冲过了牢房里狭小的窗眼，
    飞，飞，她在城市上空飞行。
    远，远，这歌声远及四方，
    人们在空中听取她。
    她沿着远远的河流漫步，
    她的宿营地——在马车的旁边，
    响彻山谷，大道，
    踏着庄稼汉的靴子到处漂泊。
    有人要枪毙她，——但她活着，
    有人要裁判她，——但她是正义的，
    道路阻塞不通，——但她照常通行……
    好像被枪弹射击的语言
    人们迅速地口口相传。
    从南方的山岳到北方森林，
    成千成万的声音更有力量，
    她，
    绕行了祖国的边疆，
    重新回到了你的牢监，希克梅特。
    ……这样，你的歌曲，胜利的歌曲——
    就是她，诗人！使你得到自由解放！
