　　Complete Railway Transport Tasks Ahead of Schedule
    Support the People's Liberation Army in Liberating Taiwan!
    "Mao Zedong" Locomotive Crew
    We, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, were extremely indignant after reading in the newspaper about the United States using armed force to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan, interfere in the internal affairs of Korea, and disrupt world peace. This shameless interference in the Chinese people's liberation and the Korean people's liberation demonstrates the true face of the American imperialist. It further shows that American imperialism is a war instigator. We Chinese working people will never tolerate this shameless interference by the American imperialists. We must transform our indignation into strength and take practical action to support the People's Liberation Army. Our locomotive crew unanimously guarantees to haul more cars, avoid delays, complete railway transport tasks ahead of schedule, and drive our locomotive to Taiwan to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Working people of the world, unite and shatter the American imperialist plot to provoke war! (Signed by the entire group, written by Yue Shangwu)

　　提前完成铁路运输任务
    支援解放军解放台湾！
    “毛泽东号”机车组
    我们“毛泽东号”机车组，在报纸上看到美国以武装干涉我国解放台湾、干涉朝鲜内政、破坏世界和平的消息后，十分愤恨美帝国主义。这种无耻的干涉中国人民的解放及朝鲜人民的解放的行为，说明了美帝国主义侵略者的真面目，更说明了美帝是战争挑动者。我们中国劳动人民，决不容忍美帝这一无耻的干涉。我们一定将愤恨变成力量，拿实地行动来支援人民解放军。我们机车组一致保证多拉车、不晚点，提前完成铁路运输任务，把我们的机车开到台湾去，支援人民解放军解放台湾。全世界劳动人民团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义的挑动战争阴谋！（全组签名、岳尚武执笔）
