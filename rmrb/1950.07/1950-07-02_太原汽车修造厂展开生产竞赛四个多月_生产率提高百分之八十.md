    Launches Production Competition for Over Four Months; Productivity Increases by Eighty Percent
    [Our Newspaper] From January 26th, when the Taiyuan Automobile Repair Factory launched the production competition, to the end of May, productivity increased by over eighty percent in the four months. Tian Qifu, the leader of the sheet metal group, shortened the time for crimping pipe mouths from 9 minutes and 49 seconds per section to 2 minutes and 50 seconds. Li Yaxing, Guo Zhangbao, Qin Longwang, and others in the group used to bend 350 chain crescent rings per day, but in May they were able to bend 1,450 per day. Many production pacesetters have created new records.
