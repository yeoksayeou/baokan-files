　　Sun Ersha, Village Head of Lizhengding Shuangdian Village, Punished for Seizing Women's Property

　　Fan Quannv, a military dependent from Xizheng Village, Xingtang (her husband is Sun Jinde, a soldier), divorced on June 14th by court decision, as proposed by Sun Jinde and agreed to by Fan Quannv. The court awarded Fan Quannv four mu of land and 350 jin of millet for alimony. Sun Laogong (who used to be the director of the village farmers' association, but was later removed from his post for making mistakes and received a probationary period within the Party), believing that this would cause the village's property to leave the village, was dissatisfied and wanted to take the opportunity to profit from it. Therefore, he colluded with the village head, Sun Ersha (who is also a member of the village Communist Party branch), to force Fan Quannv to sell the land to the village. Sun Laogong first appeared as a middleman, trying to lower the land price as much as possible, valuing the four mu of land at three dan of wheat. It was decided that the village head would buy the land, and he would be rewarded separately. But in order to conceal this from the masses, he first publicly offered the land to military dependents at a price of three dan of wheat per mu. Since the military dependents could not afford it, the land naturally went to the village head. To prevent Fan Quannv from going back on her word, they forced her to write a blank receipt for "receiving nine dan of wheat." Sun Xiaomou, who also wanted to skim some profit, had previously discussed the land price with Sun Laogong and Sun Ersha. Later, seeing that the land was being monopolized by the village head, he was dissatisfied and reported the matter to the deputy secretary of the district committee working in the village. The deputy secretary of the district committee severely criticized Sun Ersha and Sun Laogong, and allowed Fan Quannv to issue another contract to sell it to another household. Sun Laogong and others then used another trick, bribing Sun Xiaomou and using him to threaten Fan Quannv, saying: the land should still be sold to the village head, and the village head would guarantee her "safe" exit from the village with her property. The land was valued at eight dan and five dou of wheat, but the contract was still written for twelve dan. Fan Quannv reluctantly agreed to them. When measuring the land, they played tricks again, measuring three li less land, forcing Fan Quannv to return one dan of wheat. Sun Laogong and the other three divided this one dan of wheat equally.

　　Fan Quannv painfully suffered the loss of four dan and five dou of wheat, thinking that she would not be hindered when she took her property away. On June 17th, Sun Ersha, Sun Xiaomou, Sun Laogong, and his son Sun Tang drove three carts to send Fan Quannv to her nephew's house in Beigua Village, Xingtang. When they reached a large sandy beach at the junction of Zhengding and Xingtang, Ersha stopped the car and refused to go any further, saying: "We have reached the border of Zhengding and cannot send you any further! Give me a bag of wheat as foot money to let me go back!" Then he unloaded the things and two bags of wheat from the car, leaving one bag in the cart, and drove away. Sun Tang also took the opportunity to grab a bag and pull it away. At that time, Sun Erdui, a villager from the same village, rushed to persuade and helped to say good things, but to no avail. Sun Laogong then came to play the role of a two-faced person, teaching Sun Tang a few words, and then said: "Tang, don't argue, if you want wheat, I'll give you a bag, and Xiaomou will also get a bag. You send her away!" Fan Quannv was angry but dared not speak out. So, two carts sent her to Beigua. Three big bags of wheat were thus robbed. When loading the car, Sun Tang also secretly opened Fan Quannv's luggage and stole a bolt of white coarse cloth, a pair of silver bracelets, and three pieces of single clothing.

　　This barbaric act of plunder aroused public outrage in the entire village. In order to strictly enforce the law and protect the legitimate rights of women, the district not only dismissed village head Sun Ersha, but also sent him and Sun Laogong to the county people's court for punishment. Fan Quannv's land was bought by Sun Laogong and Sun Ersha together, and the land price was paid in full according to the original contract. The three bags of wheat that were robbed and the things stolen by Sun Tang were also fully compensated by them. Sun Tang and Sun Xiaomou were given severe criticism and education. At the same time, it was announced in Lishuangdian Village that no one was allowed to interfere with Fan Quannv taking her property away. In order to maintain the purity of the Party, the District Committee of the Communist Party of China has submitted a request to the County Committee for approval to expel Sun Laogong from the Party. Sun Ersha was removed from his position as branch committee member and given a public warning.

　　正定里双店村长孙二傻抢夺妇女财产受惩处
    河北正定二区里双店村军属范全女（行唐西正村人），从六月十四日经男方孙进德（军人）提议和她本人同意，由法院判决离了婚。法院判给范全女地四亩，赡养费小米三百五十斤。该村孙老贡（曾当过村农会主任，后因犯错误被撤职，在党内受留党察看处分）认为这将使本村的财产出村，心中不满，并想乘机从中取利。因此便勾结村长孙二傻（兼村中共支部委员）要范全女把地卖给本村。孙老贡先以中人面目出现，尽量把地价压低，四亩地折米价三大石小麦。决定由村长买地，另外给他报酬。但为了遮掩群众眼目，首先公开以每亩三大石小麦的地价让给军属。军属买不起，地自然就归了村长。为了防止范全女反悔，并强迫她立了一张“收到小麦九石”的空头收据。该村有一个孙小谋原先也想揩些油，曾和孙老贡、孙二傻议定地价。后来见土地给村长独吞了，心中不服气，便将此事报告了二区下乡工作的区委副书记。区委副书记严厉批评了孙二傻、孙老贡。让范全女另出文契，卖给别户。孙老贡等又另用诡计，贿买了孙小谋，通过他用威胁手段对范全女说：土地仍卖给村长，村长保证她“安全”带产出村。土作地价八大石五斗小麦，但仍按十二石立文约。范全女在被迫之下答应了他们。在丈量土地时，他们又玩弄手腕，将地丈少了三厘，强逼范全女退回小麦一大石。孙老贡等三人就将这一大石小麦平分了。
    范全女忍痛吃了四石五斗小麦的亏，以为这样带产走时不致再受阻挠了。六月十七日，孙二傻、孙小谋、孙老贡和他的儿子孙堂赶了三辆车，送范全女往行唐北洼村外甥家。走到正定与行唐交界的一个大沙滩，二傻即停车不走了，说：“到正定边界了，不能再送你！给我一布袋麦子的脚价让我回去吧！”随即卸下车上的东西和两袋麦子，车箱里留下一袋，就拨车拉走了。孙堂也乘机抢起一袋要拉走。当时有同村村民孙二堆赶到劝解，并帮助说好话，没有效果。孙老贡这时就来充两面人，把孙堂教训了几句，接着说：“堂，你别吵，要麦子就给你一袋，小谋也给一袋。你们送她走吧！”范全女有气也不敢出。于是两辆车把她送到北洼。三大布袋小麦就这样被抢去了。孙堂在装车时，还偷着打开了范全女的包袱，偷出白粗布一匹，银手镯一付，单衣三件。
    这一野蛮的掠夺事件发生后，引起全村老百姓的公愤。区里为严明法纪，卫护妇女的合法权利，除将村长孙二傻撤职外，并将他和孙老贡一同送交县人民法院惩办。范全女的地由孙老贡、孙二傻伙买了，地价按原契约补清。被抢走的三布袋小麦，和孙堂偷走的东西，也由他们全部偿还。并给孙堂、孙小谋严厉的批评教育。同时在里双店村宣布任何人不得干涉范全女带产。中共区委会为保持党的纯洁，已呈请县委批准开除孙老贡党籍。孙二傻撤销支委职务，给以当众警告处分。
