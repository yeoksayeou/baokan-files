The Veterinary Internship Station of Agricultural University
	Holds Meeting to Summarize Work Experience
    [From our newspaper] The Beijing Agricultural University Veterinary Internship Station held a work meeting in the university's auditorium at 9:00 AM on the sixth. Attendees included members of the university's school committee, heads of various departments, responsible personnel and doctors (intern teachers) from the thirty-five veterinary work stations affiliated with the university in Changzhi, Xingtai, Handan, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and other locations. The meeting's agenda included: 1. Summarizing three years of veterinary work experience; 2. Summarizing students' learning gains over the past three years; 3. The unity and exchange between traditional Chinese and Western veterinary medicine; 4. Exchanging work experiences to improve skills. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for ten days. Le Tianyu, the director of the university committee, described the development of veterinary work over the past three years, saying: In 1946, we went from Yan'an to Taihang Mountain (Changzhi) and accepted the request of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region government. In order to treat the diseases of farmers' draft animals and reduce the mortality rate of draft animals, we first hired Western veterinarians to conduct educational work. Later, due to the small number of Western veterinarians and the difficulty in obtaining Western medicine, we had no choice but to hire traditional Chinese veterinarians to conduct veterinary education work. We also held a symposium for veterinary workers and established a veterinary hospital, which was welcomed and supported by the farmers, and gradually developed into various regions of Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, with thirty-five veterinary work stations currently. He also pointed out that the future development of veterinary work still requires greater unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western veterinarians, mutual improvement, in order to improve and popularize technology. Subsequently, the person in charge of the Veterinary Association of the 13th District of Beijing delivered a speech, hoping to do a good job in the veterinary work in the suburbs of Beijing, which would benefit the people.

　　农大兽医实习工作站
    召开会议总结工作经验
    【本报讯】北京农业大学兽医实习工作站工作会议于六日上午九时在该校大礼堂开幕，到会者有该校校委会各委员与各学系负责人，有该校所属长治、邢台、邯郸、石家庄、北京等三十五个兽医工作站负责人员及医生（实习教员）。会议内容为：一、总结三年来兽医工作经验；二、总结同学们三年来学习收获；三、中西兽医团结与交流问题；四、交换工作经验，提高技术。会议日程暂定为十天。该校主任委员乐天宇在会上叙述了三年来兽医工作的发展经过，他说：我们于一九四六年由延安到太行山（长治），接受了晋冀鲁豫边府的要求，为诊治老乡们耕畜的疾病并减低耕畜死亡率，首先聘请了西兽医进行教育工作。后来因西兽医人数太少，西药困难，不能不聘请中兽医，进行兽医教育工作。又召开了兽医工作者座谈会，成立了兽医院，受到老乡们的欢迎与拥护，逐渐发展到山西、河南、河北各地区，现有兽医工作站三十五座。他并指出：今后兽医工作的发展，仍需要中西兽医更加团结合作，互相提高，以求技术的改进与普及。继由北京市十三区兽医联合会负责人致词，希望将京郊的兽医工作做好，有利于人民。
