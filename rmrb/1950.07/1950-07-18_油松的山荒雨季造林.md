　　Chinese pine (short-leafed Masson pine) is widely distributed, and most of the remaining natural forests in the northern mountainous areas of Hebei Province are Chinese pine. The people near the Eastern Tombs distinguish three types: those with heavy, yellow-colored wood and more resin are called Chinese pine or red-barked pine; those with whiter wood and less resin are called chaff pine or yellow-barked pine; and those with heavy wood, slightly reddish-yellow in color, are called rough-barked pine or thousand-barked pine. Among general coniferous tree species, Chinese pine grows relatively fast and has many branches. After five or six years of planting, the branches can be used as firewood. The wood has a wide range of uses and can be used for building construction, civil engineering, tools, and other materials, and is resistant to water and moisture. By-products include pine mushrooms and pine resin. Using Chinese pine for afforestation on barren mountains can not only yield good timber, but also prevent floods, droughts, and wind disasters, and protect farmlands, achieving both economic and security benefits in one fell swoop.

　　Although Chinese pine is a sun-loving tree species, trees on the shady slopes of a mountain always grow more luxuriantly than those on the sunny slopes, while the pine trees on the sunny slopes have more solid wood and more resin than those on the shady slopes. This is because the sunny slopes of mountains are mostly thin and dry soil, which is slightly difficult when planting initially, and the development is also slower after survival. Therefore, for quick results, it is advisable to start from the shady slopes of the mountain first.

　　Chinese pine is suitable for all types of land, but it grows fastest on sandy, loose soil mountains. It grows more slowly on clayey, stony mountains, and Chinese pine often grows even in rock crevices. Therefore, even barren land with extremely thin soil that cannot support other trees can be used for afforestation with Chinese pine.

　　The afforestation season for Chinese pine is possible in all three seasons of the year. In the Zunhua area, people are accustomed to planting or sowing in the hot season. Most of the pine mountains in areas such as Lugezhai and Qiukeyu have been cultivated during the rainy season.

　　When afforesting barren mountains with Chinese pine, the spacing should be dense, generally the most suitable is a triangular or square pattern with a spacing of two feet between rows. This spacing requires planting 1,500 seedlings or "holes" per mu of barren mountain. If using tree seedlings for afforestation, it is advisable to select three-year-old pine seedlings. For large-scale afforestation, it is advisable to divide the work and cooperate, either in groups of three or two. For example, in a group of three, one person digs the pit, seven or eight inches deep, with the excavated soil piled on one side. The second person holds the seedling, straightens the roots, places them close to one side, and presses the lower end of the roots into the soil (avoiding turning the roots upwards), then uses their hands to bury the soil along the edge of the pit. The third person uses a short-handled hoe to compact the soil. If the original soil is not enough, soil can be taken from nearby to fill it and then compacted. If the buried soil is loose, it will be difficult for the seedling to survive if it is exposed to the wind. In a group of two, the soil can be compacted after planting. When planting pine trees in the hot season, the seedlings should be planted as soon as they are dug up. If they are transported from afar, they must be sprinkled with cold water at any time to prevent the pine seedlings from heating up. For those that need to be stored overnight, the seedlings should be spread out in a shaded place and sprinkled with cold water, and then packaged or planted the next day. If the seedlings are too small, two or three seedlings can be placed in each hole. If one-third of them survive, each hole will have seedlings.

　　For sowing on barren mountains, two people can work as a group. One person digs the soil, turning over the topsoil in a circle of one foot in diameter, removing the grass roots. The second person scatters the pine seeds, about ten seeds, evenly, without clumping them together, but also not too close to the edge, and then covers them with soil, enough to cover the seeds. It should not be too deep, as it will be difficult for the seedlings to emerge. Use your feet to compact the soil to prevent air leakage. Cover the top with some grass (without roots), which not only prevents birds from pecking but also reduces evaporation. Because after the pine seeds germinate, they carry the pine skin on top. If a bird pecks at it, it will eat the cotyledons together, and no new buds will grow. If some grass is covered, the seed coat will be blocked by the grass and fall off after the buds emerge, which can prevent bird damage. One jin to one jin and two liang of seeds is required per mu of land.

　　Pure stands of Chinese pine are prone to insect pests and can be mixed with other broad-leaved tree species in strips or blocks, such as oak (suitable for autumn sowing) and Chinese sumac on sunny slopes, and maple and hickory on shady slopes.

　　油松的山荒雨季造林
    东陵区山荒造林局  张祖欣
    油松（短叶马尾松）分布极广，河北省北部山地所有残存天然林，大部均为油松。东陵附近群众则分别为三种：材质重而色黄，树脂较多的叫油松或红皮松；材质较白，树脂较少者称糠松或黄皮松；材质重、黄色稍带红色者称为粗皮松，或叫千皮松。油松在一般针叶树种中，生长较速，枝梢较多，栽上五、六年就可用枝子作柴烧。木材用处极广，能作建筑、土木、器具等用材，且耐水湿。副产物则生松蕈、松脂。荒山上用油松造林，不仅能得良好木材，且能防水旱风灾，保护山田，能获经济及保安之功用，一举两得。
    油松虽为阳性树种，但在一个山上的树，阴坡总比阳坡生长的茂盛，而阳坡的松树，材质比阴坡生长的坚实，树脂也多。因为山上的阳坡多半是土薄而且干燥，初栽时稍感困难，成活后发育亦较缓慢，所以欲求速效，宜先从山的阴坡入手。
    油松无地不宜，而以带沙质松土的山生长最快。粘土带石子的山生长较缓，纵是岩石裂缝中亦常生长有油松，所以虽土层极薄而他树不生之瘠恶土地，亦能用油松造林。
    油松的造林季节一年三季都行。在遵化一带，群众的习惯都喜欢在伏天栽植或播种，芦各寨、秋克峪一带的松山，大部分是在雨季养种起来的。
    荒山上用油松造林其距离宜密，一般最合适的是行距二尺的三角形或正方形。这样的距离每亩荒山须栽植一千五百株或“穴”，如用树苗植树造林，宜选三年生松苗。大面积造林宜分工合作，或三人一组或二人一组。如三人一组，即一人掘坑，坑深七、八寸，刨开的土堆在一边，第二人持苗，将根理直，紧贴一边，将根下端向土里按放（切忌使根向上倒翻），然后用手将坑边的土埋好，第三人持短柄小镐将土砸实。如原土不够，可从附近取土填上，再砸实。如埋的土松，一透风就不易活。如二人一组，栽后再砸也可。伏天栽松，苗木宜随起随栽，如由远处运取，须随时洒凉水，勿使松苗发热。须隔夜者，要在荫凉处散开苗木，洒上凉水，次日再行包装或栽植。苗木过小，每穴可放二、三株，如活三分之一即能每穴有苗。
    山荒播种可二人一组，一人掘土，将表土刨开，径一尺，将土翻活，除去草根，第二人撒上松子，十粒左右，须撒均匀，不使聚在一处，然亦不可太靠边，然后覆土，以能盖上松子为度。不可太深，深了不易出土，用脚踏实以免透风。上面再盖些草（不要带根的），既免鸟类啄食，且能减少蒸发，因松子出芽后，顶上带着松皮，被鸟一啄，将子叶一齐食去，就不会再生芽了。如盖些草，芽出土后，种皮就会被草阻碍而脱落，可防鸟害。一亩地须种子一斤至一斤二两。
    油松纯林，易遭虫害，可酌与其他阔叶树种作带状或块状混交，如阳坡与槲栎（宜秋播）、臭椿等，阴坡与枫、山胡桃等。
