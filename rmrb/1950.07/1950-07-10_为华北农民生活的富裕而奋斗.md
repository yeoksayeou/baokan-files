　　Striving for Prosperity in the Lives of North China's Farmers

　　After the land reform, the enthusiastic production of all strata of the rural population in North China and the trend towards prosperity in the lives of the rural people concretely demonstrate the tremendous benefits that Chinese peasants have obtained from the land reform. However, in order to make significant progress in agricultural production in North China and to rapidly improve the lives of North China's farmers, many important issues still need to be resolved. These issues deserve the deep attention of leaders in North China and the vast number of rural cadres.

　　In many old liberated areas in North China, agricultural production has already recovered to or exceeded pre-war levels last year, and the lives of farmers are much better than before the war. This is primarily because the land reform in rural North China has been basically completed. The vast majority of poor and hired peasants have been allocated land, houses, seeds, farm tools, and draft animals, and the middle peasants have also gained political and economic liberation. They are now able to engage in production freely on their own land as true masters, possessing the necessary conditions for developing production. Secondly, the war in North China ended last year, the heavy wartime service tasks have been canceled, and farmers are no longer threatened or harassed by the war, allowing them to engage in production with stability. Thirdly, the successive liberation of major and medium-sized cities across the country since last year and the restoration of national railway transportation have created new urban-rural mutual assistance relationships. Farmers' products can be transported to the cities through merchants, cooperatives, and state trading agencies, and they can obtain daily necessities, new farm tools, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and other assistance from the cities. Last winter and this spring, all strata of the rural population in North China have shown unprecedented enthusiasm in increasing livestock, increasing fertilizer, purchasing farm tools, and repairing canals and wells.

　　However, on the other hand, some farmers have some concerns about the prospects for developing their agricultural production. They see that they have already risen in status and suspect that further advancement will lead to "struggle." According to a survey of twenty-eight villages in Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar, out of one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five poor and hired peasant households, one thousand four hundred and thirty-nine, or eighty percent, have risen to the level of middle peasants, and some have even risen to the level of prosperous middle peasants. Questions such as "Is it still allowed to become prosperous?" and "If I become prosperous, will I be struggled against again?" are natural for farmers who do not fully understand the New Democratic agricultural production policy. At the same time, some poorly reformed loafers do not actively work and advocate the so-called "waiting for socialism to eat from the big pot," which also causes concern among some farmers. In addition, at that time, some areas had not yet finished issuing land certificates, and a small number of rural cadres often unconsciously violated the interests of middle peasants and violated policies in burden allocation, cooperative mutual assistance, and lending relationships to varying degrees. This also made many farmers recall certain "leftist" deviations in the past land reform and develop a certain degree of suspicion about the people's government and the Party's production policies. They once produced the erroneous view of "production does not save, labor does not lead to prosperity," which became a serious obstacle to the development of agricultural production.

　　To solve this problem, the Communist Party organizations in North China have made many efforts last winter and this spring. First, last winter, systematic education on New Democratic construction and education on the prospects for social development were conducted extensively and on a large scale through the training of Communist Party members and cadres and winter schools. Secondly, the leading organs in various regions promoted the agricultural production policies, burden policies, and lending policies of the people's government at all levels of people's representative conferences, and the representatives made extensive explanations to people from all walks of life after the meetings. People's governments in various regions have mostly convened labor hero conferences and technical seminars to encourage production. People's governments in various regions have also promulgated or reiterated proclamations protecting the people's private property, resolutely corrected incidents of infringement on farmers' land rights and property rights that occurred in individual regions, and quickly completed the issuance of land certificates. After extensive publicity and the resolution of specific problems last winter and this spring, farmers' ideological concerns have been greatly reduced, and their production enthusiasm has been further encouraged. Therefore, in spring plowing, sowing, pest control, summer harvesting, and especially in completing the cotton planting task, their enthusiasm has been unprecedented in previous years. Land disputes have increased compared to the past, and land prices in some places have increased by one to three times compared to before.

　　However, the lives of North China's farmers are still far from truly prosperous. What else should we do to make farmers' lives prosperous?

　　First, we should further popularize and deepen our publicity on the New Democratic agricultural production policy and continue to consolidate and improve farmers' enthusiasm for production. Farmers' ideological concerns have not been completely and thoroughly eliminated universally. Therefore, the people's government and the Communist Party's workers in the rural areas should continue to repeatedly explain to the farmers that the people's government and the Communist Party hope that the farmers will live more prosperously, because this prosperity is not only beneficial to the farmers but also to the country, not only beneficial to agriculture but also to industry. It should be explained that in a New Democratic country, it is right, glorious, and protected and rewarded by the government to enjoy a prosperous life by relying on one's own labor; it is shameful to be reduced to poverty because of laziness and waste. It should be pointed out that the implementation of socialism in the country and in rural areas is not only a matter for the very distant future, but also that socialism can only make each farmer's family live more prosperously, which is completely contrary to the "eating from the big pot" advocated by loafers. When socialism is realized in the countryside in the future, just like the current Soviet Union, agriculture will be produced by machines, and everyone will be organized collectively on large-scale farms using machines for large-scale production. The things produced will be many times more than now; but at that time, the consumption of farmers will still be dispersed, and each person will still live their own family life. Because there is a lot of production, the labor fruits distributed to individuals will also be a lot, so the lives of each family will be many times more prosperous than now. Collective production, taking value according to labor, and separate consumption are the basic principles of the socialist system. However, that is still a matter for the future. Our country's industrial production is not yet developed, and there are very few agricultural machines, which are far behind the conditions of the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is no talk of organizing collective farms. Except for a small number of state-owned farms, only a large number of individual farms of individual farmers can be developed. Although individual farmers cannot have the prosperity of collective farmers, as long as they manage well, they can still be much more prosperous than now. Farmers should feel relieved to add livestock and farm tools, apply more fertilizer, diligently repair water conservancy, and develop side businesses in order to make their lives more prosperous. It should be explained that after a great development in production, a small number of middle peasants will inevitably develop into rich peasants, which is allowed. The operation of rich peasants is protected by the laws of the people's government, because it is also beneficial to the development of current agricultural production. These principles should be explained clearly to the farmers universally.

　　Second, according to the experience of Handan Prefecture in Hebei and Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan, in order to publicize the policies of the people's government and the Communist Party universally and effectively, it is necessary to solve the problems encountered by farmers in developing production concretely at the same time. Just having propaganda and education without practical measures cannot enable farmers to experience the authenticity of the policies from actual movement. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely continue to implement the government's decrees on protecting the people's private property, and any illegal acts that violate policies and infringe on the people's property rights and land rights must be resolutely corrected, and the offenders must be given due punishment. At the same time, it is necessary to actively lead the people's production and solve their difficulties in production.

　　Third, in order to overcome the difficulties of farmers' labor and livestock, and in order to solve the technical difficulties that individual farmers are not easy to solve, it is necessary to promote labor mutual assistance among farmers on the basis of individual economy with voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange. Labor mutual assistance has great benefits for farmers' production. According to the experience of labor mutual assistance in the old liberated areas, the labor force organized in mutual assistance groups can generally抵二人抵三人, and in model mutual assistance groups,一人抵二人. Li Shunda's model mutual assistance group in PingShun, Shanxi, after several years of mutual assistance, has now exceeded pre-war levels in output per mu. However, labor mutual assistance must be voluntary, mutually beneficial, and of equivalent exchange. The labor mutual assistance movement in various parts of North China has declined in recent years, which does not mean that farmers are wealthy, the difficulties of labor and livestock have been relatively resolved, and farmers no longer need mutual assistance. The main reason is that many mutual assistance groups have violated the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and equivalence. That is to say, the egalitarian thinking of agricultural socialism has hindered the development of mutual assistance groups. Therefore, after the farmers' ideological concerns are relieved, the farmers' spontaneous mutual assistance groups begin to increase. When promoting farmers' mutual assistance and cooperation, it should be explained to the farmers that promoting labor mutual assistance is by no means forcing labor mutual assistance, because New Democratic agricultural production completely allows "going it alone" (and even under the socialist system, "going it alone" is allowed), and no one has the right to interfere with farmers' freedom to "go it alone." We should continue to promote voluntary labor mutual assistance, and at the same time promote labor mutual assistance and "going it alone" competition, so that farmers who go it alone can see that participating in mutual assistance is indeed more beneficial to themselves, and voluntarily participate in mutual assistance.

　　Fourth, recent experiences in various parts of North China have proved that after farmers' ideological concerns are resolved, it is necessary to strive to lead and help farmers solve technical problems in production. Although agricultural production in North China has had considerable recovery and development in the past few years, because it has just been liberated from the feudal system not long ago, production technology is still backward, and the newly liberated cities do not provide enough scientific knowledge and technical assistance to agricultural production, which has caused the productivity of rural North China to stop in a low and pitiful state. Agricultural yields cannot be increased quickly, and farmers are often unable to overcome various natural disasters. In order to improve agricultural technology, farmers in Anyang and other places are currently engaged in agricultural experiments in their own small flower beds or vegetable gardens, making earthen sprayers, collectively visiting and studying the farming methods of neighboring villages, and experimenting with and transforming new farm tools. They demand that cadres no longer conduct empty political education on them, but hope to give them specific technical assistance. This enthusiasm is extremely valuable. Our rural work cadres, agricultural scientific research institutions, and agricultural machinery factories must pay attention to listening to their opinions and meet their requirements in a planned and step-by-step manner in order to truly improve agricultural production in North China.

　　Finally, in order to lead farmers to develop production, it is necessary to improve the work style of cadres, which is entirely possible. The experience of Anyang Prefecture proves that rural cadres, because they correctly lead farmers to develop production, have not only made farmers understand the New Democratic agricultural production policy more clearly, but also greatly changed their general work style. At present, they are being forced to abandon the set of methods they are familiar with in the work of war and land reform, and strengthen their own learning in light of the specific ideological conditions and production conditions of farmers in order to further solve the ideological problems, production organization problems, and especially the problems of improving technology of farmers. Other places should also learn from this example.

　　The above is the main task that cadres in the rural areas of North China should work together to improve agricultural production in North China and enrich the lives of North China's farmers.

### 为华北农民生活的富裕而奋斗

　　为华北农民生活的富裕而奋斗
    土地改革后，华北农村各阶层的积极生产与农村人民生活的走向富裕，具体地证明了中国农民由土地改革所得到的巨大利益。但是为了使华北农业生产有长足的进展，使华北农民生活有迅速的改善，还必须解决许多重要的问题。这些问题，值得华北各地领导上及广大农村干部加以深切注意。
    华北不少老区的农业生产去年已经恢复到或超过战前水平，农民生活比战争前已经好多了。这首先是因为华北农村土地改革已基本完成，广大的贫雇农民已经分得了土地、房屋、种籽、农具和耕畜，中农也获得了政治上经济上的解放，他们能够真正以主人的资格在自己的土地上自由地进行生产，具备着发展生产的必要条件。其次由于战争在华北已于去年结束，繁重的战勤任务业已取消，农民再不受战争的威胁和骚扰，得以安定地进行生产。再次是由于去年以来全国各大、中城市的相继解放，全国铁路交通的恢复，产生了新的城乡互助关系，农民的生产品得以经过商人、合作社和国家贸易机关运进城市，并从城市中取得自己所需要的日用品、新式农具、杀虫药、化学肥料及其他的帮助。去冬今春，华北农村各阶层无论在增加牲口，增加肥料，购买农具，修渠打井等方面，都显示了空前的积极与热烈。
    但是另一方面，也有一部分农民，对于他们发展农业生产的前途发生了若干顾虑。他们看到自己已经上升了，怀疑再上升要被“斗争”。据山西、河北、察哈尔二十八个村的调查，一千八百六十五户贫雇农中，已有一千四百三十九户即百分之八十已上升为中农，其中还有一部分上升为富裕中农，“是否还允许富裕呢？”“富裕了是否再被斗呢？”这种疑问在不完全了解新民主主义农业生产政策的农民说来，是自然而然的。同时有些少数未改造好的二流子不积极劳动，鼓吹所谓“等待社会主义吃大锅饭”，这也引起一部分农民的疑虑。加上那时有些地区土地证还未发完，少数农村干部中还往往不自觉地在负担分配、合作互助和借贷关系中或多或少地侵犯中农利益，违犯政策。这也使不少农民回忆起过去土改中某些“左”的偏向，而对人民政府和党的生产政策发生某种程度的怀疑。他们一度产生了所谓“生产不节约，劳动不致富”的错误观点，这种错误观点成为发展农业生产的严重障碍。
    华北各地共产党的组织为了解决这个问题，去冬今春曾经作过不少努力。首先是去年冬季曾普遍地大规模地经过共产党员干部的训练和冬学，进行了有系统的新民主主义建设的教育和社会发展前途的教育。其次，各地领导机关在各级人民代表会议上宣传了人民政府的农业生产政策、负担政策、借贷政策，代表们在会后向各界人民作了广泛的解释。各地人民政府大都召开了劳动英雄会、技术座谈会，鼓励生产。各地人民政府又颁布了或重申了保护人民私有财产的布告，对个别地区发生的侵犯农民地权财权的事件进行了坚决的纠正，并迅速发完土地证。经过去冬今春广泛的宣传和具体问题的解决，农民思想顾虑业已大大减轻，生产情绪得到更大的鼓励。因此，在春耕、播种、除虫、夏收，特别是在完成植棉任务上，其积极性均为历年所未有。土地纠纷较前增多了，土地价格有的地方比以前提高一倍到三倍。
    但是华北农民生活，离开真正的富裕还远。为了使农民生活富裕起来，我们还应该作些什么呢？
    第一，还应该普及和加深我们对于新民主主义农业生产政策的宣传，继续巩固和提高农民生产的积极性。农民的思想顾虑，还没有完全彻底和普遍地消除。因此，人民政府和共产党在农村中的工作人员，仍应继续反复地向农民说明：人民政府和共产党是希望农民生活得更富裕，因为这种富裕不但有利于农民，也有利于国家，不但有利于农业，也有利于工业。应当说明：在新民主主义的国家中，依靠自己的劳动而享受富裕的生活，这是正当的，光荣的，受政府保护和奖励的；如果因为懒惰浪费而降为贫穷，那才是可耻的。应当指出：在全国和农村中实行社会主义，不单是很远的将来的事情，而且社会主义只能使每个农民家庭生活得更富裕，与二流子所说的“吃大锅饭”是完全相反的两回事。将来社会主义在农村中实现的时候，正像现在的苏联那样，农业已用机器生产了，大家有组织地集体地在大规模的农场上用机器进行大规模的生产，生产出来的东西要比现在多好几倍；但那时农民的消费还是分散的，还是各人过各人的家庭生活，因为生产的很多，个人分配的劳动果实也很多，所以各个家庭的生活就比现在要富裕好几倍。集体生产，按劳取值，分别消费，就是社会主义制度的基本原则。不过那还是将来的事，我们中国现在工业生产还不发达，农业机器极少，比苏联的条件落后的很远，因此谈不到组织集体农场，除少数国营农场以外，只能大量发展农民各人一小块土地的个体农场。个体农民虽然不能有集体农民那样的富裕，但是只要好好经营，还是可以比现在富裕的多。农民应当放心大胆的添置牲口农具，多施肥料，勤修水利，发展副业，以便使生活过的更加富裕。应当说明：农民在生产大发展以后，必然会有少数中农发展成为富农，这是允许的。富农的经营是受到人民政府的法律保护的，因为它对发展现在的农业生产也是有利的。这些道理，都应当向农民普遍地解释清楚。
    第二，根据河北邯郸专区和平原安阳专区的经验，为了普遍有效地宣传人民政府和共产党的政策，必须同时具体地解决农民发展生产中所遇到的问题。单有宣传教育而没有实际的措施，便不能使农民从实际运动中体验到政策的真实性。因此，必须坚决继续贯彻政府关于保护人民私有财产的法令，对于任何破坏政策、侵犯人民财权地权的违法行为必须坚决纠正，并予犯法者以应得的处分，同时积极领导人民生产，解决他们生产中的困难。
    第三，为着克服农民劳畜力的困难，为着解决个体农民所不易解决的技术困难，必须提倡农民在个体经济的基础上实行自愿互利等价交换的劳动互助。劳动互助对农民生产有很大的利益。根据老区劳动互助的经验，组织在互助组中的劳动力一般地二人可抵三人，在模范的互助组中，一人可抵二人。山西平顺劳动英雄李顺达模范互助组在几年的互助以后，现在每亩产量已超过战前一倍。但是劳动互助必须是自愿的、互利的、等价交换的。华北各地的劳动互助运动在近年有下降趋势，这决不是说，农民富裕了，劳畜力的困难已相对解决了，农民也就再不需要互助；其主要原因，正是许多互助组违反了自愿互利和等价的原则。也就是说，农业社会主义的平均思想阻碍了互助组的发展。因此，当农民思想顾虑解除了以后，农民自发的互助组就开始增加起来了。在提倡农民互助合作的时候，应当向农民说明：提倡劳动互助，决不是强迫劳动互助，因为新民主主义的农业生产是完全允许“单干”的（就是社会主义制度下也是允许“单干”的），任何人无权干涉农民“单干”的自由。我们应当继续提倡自愿的劳动互助，同时提倡劳动互助和“单干”竞赛，以便使单干的农民看到参加互助果然对自己更加有利，而自愿地参加互助。
    第四，最近华北各地经验证明：在农民的思想顾虑一经解决之后，就必须努力领导和帮助农民解决关于生产中的技术问题。华北几年来农业生产虽有相当的恢复和发展，但是因为刚刚从封建制度下解放出来不久，生产技术还是落后，新解放的城市对农业生产的科学知识和技术帮助还很不够，这就使得华北农村的生产率不得不停止在低下可怜的状态。农业产量还不能很快地提高，农民对于各种天然的灾害常常还不能战胜。为了提高农业技术，目前安阳等地农民在自己一小块的花畦或菜园内搞农业试验，制作土喷雾器，集体参观研究邻村的耕种方法，并在试验和改造新式农具。他们要求干部不要再向他们进行空洞的政治教育，而希望给予他们技术上的具体帮助。这种热情是极其宝贵的。我们的农村工作干部和农业科学研究机关、农业机器厂必须注意地倾听他们这种意见，有计划有步骤地满足他们这种要求，才能真正使华北农业生产提高一步。
    最后，为了领导农民发展生产，必须改善干部的工作作风，而这是完全可能的。安阳专区的经验，证明农村干部们因为正确地领导农民发展生产，不但使农民更加明确地懂得了新民主主义的农业生产政策，而且大大地转变了自己的一般的工作作风。目前他们正是被迫着放弃了他们在战争与土地改革工作中所熟悉的一套，而在针对农民的具体思想状况和生产状况来加强自己的学习，以求进一步地解决农民的思想问题，生产组织问题，特别是提高技术的问题。其他的地方，也应当学习这个榜样。
    以上所说的，就是为着华北农业生产的提高，为着华北农民生活的富裕，华北农村中的干部应当共同努力的主要任务。
