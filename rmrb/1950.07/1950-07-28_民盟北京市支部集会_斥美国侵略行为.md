　　Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League Holds Meeting
    Condemns American Acts of Aggression

    [This newspaper reports] The Beijing branch of the China Democratic League held a forum on the 13th of this month to oppose American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Dozens of League members attended. The forum was presided over by Li Helin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Branch. Tao Dayong, Chang Renxia, Hong Yisheng, Chen Xingui, Zhang Qiaose, Li Helin, and Shen Baoji spoke successively, unanimously denouncing the American military aggression against Taiwan and Korea. They pointed out that the American imperialists' blatant dispatch of the Seventh Fleet into China's territorial waters around Taiwan, attempting to prevent us from liberating Taiwan, has aroused great anger among the Chinese people. It has strengthened our will and confidence to liberate Taiwan at an early date. The American aggression in Korea is suffering repeated defeats. The Korean people will surely achieve victory. The speakers also suggested that League members should launch propaganda against American aggression at any time and any place, explain to the masses our determination and confidence in liberating Taiwan, actively support the war to liberate Taiwan, and enthusiastically support the heroic struggle of the Korean people.
