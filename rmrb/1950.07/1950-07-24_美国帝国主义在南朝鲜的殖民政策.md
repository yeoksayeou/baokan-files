American Imperialism's Colonial Policy in South Korea
    Li Chengye, Minister of Justice of the Korean People's Democratic Republic

    On January 9th of this year, the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front appealed to all Korean people:
    "In the southern part of our Republic, unprecedented and unbearable situations have occurred. The traitorous gang of Li Seung-man, supported by the bayonets of American imperialists, has established a fascist police system in the south of our country, persecuting and massacring the righteous people of our country - patriotic and democratic elements, engaging in plundering and economic sabotage, and ravaging the countryside."
    South Korea has become a veritable hell. Amidst all the persecutions, massacres, hunger, poverty and unemployment of the terror policy, the South Korean people are in a very miserable state.
    From the day of North Korea's liberation to the end of 1949, more than 150,000 patriotic elements were murdered in South Korea. In the last six months alone, 62,000 outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people have stained the land of the motherland with their blood. In the second half of last year, 162 patriotic political parties and social organizations were formally banned and had to go underground.
    Now, the situation of the South Korean people is even more embarrassing. Repression and massacre are intensifying, and all ideas related to freedom are being persecuted and suppressed. The last vestiges of any democratic freedom have been eliminated.
    A brutal fascist system rules the southern region of our country, but who is the culprit behind this? The culprit is the American colonialists and their agent - the traitorous Li Seung-man. They attempt to divide Korea and turn the south into a colony of American imperialists.
    In the past, Japan occupied Korea, relying on its police system, adopting deception and suppression, and cruelly exploiting the Korean people. Their successors - the Americans - are savagely destroying the national economy in South Korea, implementing undisguised bloody terror, and conducting large-scale massacres of the Korean people. These atrocities are no less than those of the Hitler bandits.
    Thanks to the heroic Soviet Red Army's crushing of Japanese imperialism and liberating Korea, the Korean people have opened up a broad path for developing the country on the basis of independent revival and democracy. The Korean people, who had been oppressed by Japanese imperialism for forty years, gained their national independence. All the genuinely democratic forces in the country actively participated in the construction of their new country. Patriotic elements, democratic parties and social organizations launched great work. In a short period of time, People's Committees were formed according to the initiative of the entire people.
    However, from the day the American imperialists landed in southern Korea, they began to suppress the people's democratic movement. They destroyed the People's Committees in South Korea, and they forcibly stopped all the activities of the Korean people to fight for democratic freedom and to implement land reform and other reforms. American imperialism immediately restored the administrative organs of the Japanese occupiers, which were hated by the Korean people and were personally disbanded by the Korean people immediately after liberation.
    The American and British imperialists, with the assistance of the Li Seung-man group, disregarded the reasonable and sincere policy of the great Soviet Union, violated the wishes of all the Korean people, and tore up the decision on Korea made by the Soviet, American, and British foreign ministers at the Moscow Conference in October 1945.
    The American military authorities perfidiously violated the responsibilities they assumed at the Moscow Conference and tore up the suggestion made by the head of the Soviet delegation to simultaneously withdraw troops from Korea and give the Korean people the power to decide their own destiny.
    On the contrary, the bloody oppressors turned South Korea into a country with the most brutal police system.
    The Korean people responded to the establishment of the police system and large-scale terror with armed resistance. After the heroic October uprising in 1946, there were many successive popular movements. The people were fighting for national reunification and independence and for better living conditions.
    For the sake of their colonial plans, the American imperialists were determined to permanently maintain the temporary division of Korea. Disregarding the firm protests of the democratic countries of the world, led by the Soviet Union, and disregarding the anger of all the Korean people, they brought the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly and, with the help of their voting machine, formed the so-called "United Nations Korean Commission." They forcibly conducted a separate "election" in South Korea on May 10, 1948, and formed the South Korean puppet "government" of the Li Seung-man group.
    The entire Korean people lodged angry public protests. The people of South Korea launched a struggle to save the motherland. They clearly recognized that under the rule of the cruel colonialists - the murderers of peaceful residents - it was impossible to obtain satisfaction of their legitimate demands by peaceful means. Terror needs to be answered with terror.
    The Li Seung-man group and his protectors, in suppressing the South Korean people's movement, clearly surpassed the Hitler bandits in terms of their cruel methods of insulting patriots. There are many facts to prove this.
    In the spring of 1949, the Jongno Police Station in Seoul arrested a thirty-eight-year-old woman named Jeon Ja-hyang because she was suspected of participating in democratic front activities. The police subjected her to various tortures, starting with electric shock. But not a single word that could be used by the enemy came out of this woman's mouth. So the police inserted a water dragon hose into her lower abdomen and began to pour water with a powerful pump. The woman's abdomen immediately swelled up like a mountain. Later, the police turned her over on her back and began to trample on her with leather shoes until the water was completely drained. Such torture was repeated several times. But all kinds of inhuman insults did not break the spirit of this female patriot. That night, the police shot her dead.
    In October 1949, the 18th Regiment of the so-called "National Defense Army" military police arrested a twenty-nine-year-old named Jeon Young-seop in Ongjin. The military police used torture to "interrogate" his political beliefs and secret activities. This brave and fearless patriot refused to answer any questions. The military police put his hands on the table and nailed two large nails into each of his palms in order to force him to confess. Bright red blood flowed down the table. But he remained silent. So the brutal military police nailed four more nails into each palm. The military police still did not get any material, and finally, they shot him dead too.
    Large-scale massacres of patriotic elements without trial and interrogation became more and more open. The scale is also getting bigger and bigger.
    In mid-June 1949, in Ongjin County alone, 289 young men and women were subjected to horrific torture for actively striving for national independence and reunification. They were buried in the ground up to their shoulders, and after a few hours, they were shot in the head and died.
    On September 29, 1949, in Hamyeong-eup, South Jeolla Province, fifteen people were brought to the market square and had their tongues cut out. Among them were four young girls and two young boys. All of them were stabbed in the abdomen with bayonets and died there in the square.
    News from South Korea has to go through strict censorship by the Li Seung-man "government." But even based on these reports, it can be seen the scale of the massacres carried out by this "government." For example, Li Seung-man's official newspaper, "Yonhap News," reported on January 11, 1950, that by the end of last year, during the fourteen months of "purification and suppression" in South Jeolla Province alone, 49,900 peaceful residents' families were destroyed. The number of victims exceeded 280,000. One hundred and twenty million won worth of property was looted and destroyed. The number of children who lost their parents exceeded 20,000.
    This is the situation in South Korea, which American Secretary of State Acheson called a "free nation" and the chairman of the U.S. Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee called a "democratic fortress in the Far East."
    The South Korean Li Seung-man regime is supported and subsidized by American imperialism. In the second half of 1949 alone, the United States supplied Li Seung-man with weapons and military supplies worth 70 million US dollars. In addition, the Americans, with selfish purposes, signed several agreements with Li Seung-man similar to the "Mutual Assistance Agreement" and "Military Advisory Group Agreement."
    In order to fulfill the agreement of the "Military Advisory Group Agreement," American imperialism has supplied Li Seung-man with weapons worth 10 million US dollars. This "agreement" transferred all supervision rights of combat training, as well as direct command of the Li Seung-man gang's combat operations, into the hands of the Americans.
    According to these "agreements," the American military authorities launched the work of building an extensive network of airports on South Korean territory. In the second half of last year, they invested 350,000 US dollars in so-called "aviation equipment" and built air force bases in cities such as Suwon, Gwangju, Daegu and Jeju Island. In addition, they expanded the base to Guryongpo, occupied it, and signed the so-called "Agreement on the Use of Guryongpo Airport by the United States and Korea" on January 14, 1950. According to the plan of the "Economic Assistance Bureau," it is stipulated that in the first half of 1950, another 280,000 US dollars will be invested in the equipment of new military air force bases, and 630,000 US dollars will be invested in the second half of the year.
    In the three years of American imperialism's rule in South Korea, South Korea's economy has been completely destroyed and suppressed by American companies. There are many reports on this aspect. The economic yearbook published by the "Bank of Korea" in Seoul reported in 1949 that the total value of South Korean industrial products in 1948 did not reach 21.2% of the production volume in 1940. Only 21.6% of the 90% of enterprises formerly owned by Japanese people are now operating.
    In order to "revive" South Korea's industry, the Li Seung-man group signed the so-called "Korea-US Economic Mutual Assistance Agreement" with American imperialism in 1948. In order to thoroughly enslave South Korea, they organized the "Economic Assistance Bureau" in Seoul, nominally established to lead the economic revival of South Korea.
    However, this agency has become a tool for extracting millions of funds from the suffering people of South Korea. In the 60 million US dollars of "credit loans" released by the United States to Li Seung-man in the second half of 1949, 20% was used to maintain the "Economic Assistance Bureau" agency, pay for shipping and other expenses. As a result, Americans recovered more than 10 million US dollars in various forms of services. Only 560,000 US dollars, or less than 1% of the total "credit loan," was used for machinery and equipment. However, American imperialism shouted to the world that they are reviving the economy of South Korea.
    In fact, South Korea's economy is in a very serious situation. The total amount of banknotes in circulation in August 1945 did not exceed 800,000,000,000 won, but now it far exceeds 7,000,000,000,000 won. The market is filled with American and Japanese industrial products. The purchasing power of workers is extremely low, while agriculture is sluggish and the prices of agricultural products are soaring. A unit of rice (seven kilograms) is worth 2,000 won. There is a severe shortage of products, making people's lives difficult.
    Even swindlers like Vance of the "Economic Assistance Bureau" cannot deny the bad results of American imperialism's "assistance" to South Korea. Vance said in his December report to Congress: "The financial situation of the Korean government has recently deteriorated sharply. The government's debt to the Bank of Korea has reached 7,900,000,000,000 won, an increase of 2,500,000,000,000 won compared with the beginning of the year" (January 25, 1950, "Yonhap News" report).
    But despite the failure of American imperialism's aid to the Li Seung-man "government," the United States decided to allocate another 60 million US dollars of "credit loans" in February 1950.
    The course of historical development shows that since 6 billion US dollars could not save Chiang Kai-shek from an inevitable collapse, similarly, no loans can save Li Seung-man's corrupt system. But American imperialism did not stop there. The establishment of the "Economic Assistance Bureau" cannot satisfy the bosses of Wall Street. Recently, they formed the so-called "Korean Financial and Economic Issues Committee." According to the economic policy stipulated by this "Committee," the highest economic power is in the hands of the so-called "President of the Republic" Li Seung-man. The "Committee's" authority includes all economic and financial areas, and in order to facilitate the leadership of the national economy, thirteen departments were established: such as the "Industrial Equipment" Department, "Food" Department, "Budget" Department, "Property Compensation" Department, etc. The "Committee" is composed of five Americans and three ministers of the "Korean government." This fact shows that American rule has penetrated into all South Korean economic undertakings.
    The people of North Korea are more closely united around the government of the People's Democratic Republic, headed by the people's leader and hero Kim Il-sung, to contribute all their strength to the unification of the motherland. The people of North Korea are fighting selflessly to consolidate the democratic reforms they have achieved through their own efforts, and to complete and exceed the two-year people's economic plan. The people of South Korea, recognizing the true face of the American aggressors and their lackey Li Seung-man group, have launched increasingly widespread guerrilla warfare to fight for the freedom and independence of the motherland, and to completely drive out the traitors of the people and their American masters.

　　美国帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民政策
    朝鲜人民共和国司法部部长  李承烨
    今年一月九日，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义阵线号召全朝鲜人民说：
    “在我们共和国的南部，发生了史无前例的难以忍受的情况。卖国匪帮李承晚，在美帝国主义者刺刀的支持下，在我们祖国南部建立了法西斯警察制度，迫害着、虐杀着我们祖国的正义人士——爱国分子和民主分子，干着抢掠和破坏经济的行为，蹂躏着乡村。”
    南朝鲜成了真正的地狱，在恐怖政策的一切迫害，大批的屠杀、饥饿、贫困和失业等等情况中间，南朝鲜人民是十分凄惨的。
    自北朝鲜解放那一天起至一九四九年底，在南朝鲜，残杀了十五万余爱国分子。仅在近六个月中，朝鲜人民的六万二千个优秀的儿女，用自己的鲜血染红了祖国的大地。去年下半年，一百六十二个爱国政党和社会团体被正式禁止，只得转入地下。
    现在，南朝鲜人民的处境更难堪了。镇压和屠杀日益加剧，一切有关自由的思想受到了迫害和压制。任何民主自由的最后标志都被消灭了。
    兽性法西斯制度统治着我国南部地区，可是谁是这事情的罪魁呢？罪魁就是美国殖民地者和他们的代理人——李承晚卖国匪徒。他们妄图分裂朝鲜，把南部变为美帝国主义者的殖民地。
    过去日本占领着，依靠着自己的警察制度，采取欺骗和压制的手段，残酷地剥削过朝鲜人民，他们的后继者——美国人——在朝鲜南部野蛮地破坏着国民经济，实现着难以掩饰的血腥恐怖，大规模地屠杀着朝鲜人民，这种暴行是并不比希特勒匪徒显得差些的。
    由于英勇的苏联红军粉碎了日本帝国主义，把朝鲜解放，朝鲜人民打开了在独立复兴和民主的基础上发展国家的坦途。在日本帝国主义压榨下过了四十年的朝鲜人民，获得了自己国家的独立。国家所有的真正民主力量，都积极地参加了自己新国家的建设。爱国分子、民主政党和社会团体展开了伟大的工作。在短期间内，按照全民的倡议，组成了人民委员会。
    但是，美国帝国主义者却从它登陆朝鲜南部那一天起，就开始镇压人民民主运动。在南朝鲜摧残人民委员会，它用武力制止了朝鲜人民为争取民主自由，为实行土改及其他改革而进行的一切活动。美国帝国主义立刻回复了为朝鲜人民所憎恨的日本占领者的行政机关，这个机关是朝鲜人民在解放后立即亲手解散的。
    美、英帝国主义者，在李承晚集团的协助下，不顾伟大苏联的合理的、真诚的政策，违反着所有朝鲜人民的愿望，撕碎了苏、美、英三外长在一九四五年十月莫斯科会议上关于朝鲜的决定。
    美国军事当局，背信弃义地破坏了在莫斯科会议上为他们所承担的责任，撕碎了苏联代表团长所提出的关于苏美同时从朝鲜撤退驻军，并使朝鲜人民自己有决定自己命运的权力这一项建议。
    相反地，血腥的压榨者们把南朝鲜变成了最残酷的警察制度的国家。
    朝鲜人民用武力的反抗，回答了警察制度的建立和大规模的恐怖。在一九四六年英勇的十月起义后，连续发生了好多次人数众多的人民运动。人民为祖国统一与独立，为改善生活条件而战斗着。
    美国帝国主义者为了自己殖民计划的利益，抱定宗旨要把朝鲜的暂时分割状态永远维持下去。他们不顾以苏联为首的全世界民主国家的坚决抗议，不顾全朝鲜人民的愤怒，把朝鲜问题带入了联合国大会，借助于自己的投票机器，组成了所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”。他们在南朝鲜强迫地进行了一九四八年五月十日的单独“选举”，组成了李承晚集团的南朝鲜傀儡“政府”。
    全朝鲜人民提出了愤怒的公开抗议。南朝鲜的人民掀起了挽救祖国的斗争。他们认识明白：在残酷的殖民者——和平居民的凶手的统治下，不可能用和平方法获得满足自己合法的要求。对于恐怖是需要以恐怖来回答的。
    李承晚集团和他的保护者们，在镇压南朝鲜人民运动的时候，按其侮辱爱国者的残酷方法而言，显然超过了希特勒匪特。关于这一点，有许多事实可以证明。
    一九四九年春季，汉城钟路警察分署抓着了一个三十八岁的妇女全慈香，因为她有参加民主阵线活动的嫌疑，警察从用电刑开始，使她受到了各种各样的拷问。但是从这个女人的嘴里没有吐露出任何一个能为敌人利用的字眼来。于是警察用一条水龙软管插入她的下腹部，用强力的唧筒开始灌水。妇人的腹部立刻像山一样的臌胀起来。后来，警察把她脊背朝上翻过身来，开始用皮鞋践踏，直至水完全流出为止。这样的酷刑反复地进行了几次。但是各种惨无人性的侮辱，并没有摧折了这位女爱国者的精神。就在那天的夜里，警察把她枪毙了。
    一九四九年十月，所谓“国防军”宪兵第十八团，在瓮津抓着了一个二十九岁的全永燮。宪兵用拷打“审讯”他的政治信仰和秘密活动。这位英勇无畏的爱国者拒绝回答任何问题。宪兵们把他的双手放在桌子上，在他两个手掌上钉上两个大钉子，为的是强迫他招供。鲜红的血沿着桌子流下。但是，他默不作声。于是，兽行的宪兵又在每个手掌上钉上四个钉子。宪兵们仍然得不到任何材料，最后，也把他枪杀了。
    不经过法庭和审讯的大规模屠杀爱国分子，是愈来愈公开了。那规模亦愈来愈大。
    一九四九年六月中旬，在瓮津一县，就有二百八十九个青年男女为争取积极实现祖国独立与统一，而遭受到恐怖的拷问。他们被齐肩地埋在土里，过了几个钟头，便被枪弹打中头部死了。
    一九四九年九月二十九日，在全罗南道咸平城里，十五个人被带到市场的广场上；割掉他们的舌头。其中有四个少女和两个少年。所有他们，就在广场那里，全被用刺刀刺腹而死。
    南朝鲜所发出的消息，要经过李承晚“政府”的严格检查。但就是根据这些报道，也可以看出这个“政府”所进行的大批屠杀的规模。例如，李承晚的机关报《联合新闻》，在一九五○年一月十一日报道：到去年年底为止，仅在向全罗南道一省进行“清乡讨伐”的十四个月期间，就有四万九千九百户和平居民的家庭被破坏了。受害人数超过了二十八万。一百二十万万元的财产被掠夺和毁掉了。失去父母的儿童数目，超过了二万之多。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊称为“自由国家”而美国会的外交委员会主席称为“远东民主堡垒”的南朝鲜的情况就如此。
    南朝鲜李承晚政权受到了美帝的支持和津贴。仅在一九四九年后半年中，美国就以价值七千万美元的武器和军需品，供给李承晚。此外，美国人怀着自利的目的，与李承晚签订了类似“互助协定”、“军事顾问团协定”等等的几个协定。
    为了履行“军事顾问团协定”的约定，美国帝国主义已经供给了李承晚价值一千万美元的武器。这个“协定”，把作战训练的全部监督权，以及李承晚匪帮作战行动的直接指挥权，转交到美国人之手了。
    根据这些“协定”，美国军事当局展开了在南朝鲜领土上建筑广泛的飞机场网的工作。在去年后半年，他们把三十五万美元投资到所谓“航空设备”中，并在水原、光州、大邱诸城市和济州岛筑成了空军基地。此外，他们把基地扩张至九龙浦，把它占为己有，在一九五○年一月十四日签订了所谓“美国、朝鲜使用九龙浦机场的协定”。根据“经济援助局”的计划，在新的军事空军基地的设备方面，规定在一九五○年上半年，还要投资二十八万，在下半年投资六十三万。
    在美国帝国主义统治南朝鲜三年之中，南朝鲜的经济完全遭到了破坏，并受到了美国公司的压制。这一方面是有许多报道的。汉城“朝鲜银行”所出版的经济年鉴，于一九四九年报道：一九四八年全部南朝鲜工业产品额，没有达到一九四○年生产量的百分之二十一点二。从前属于日人所有的百分之九十的企业，在现在开工的仅有百分之二十一点六。
    李承晚集团为了使南朝鲜的工业“复活”，曾于一九四八年与美帝签订了所谓“朝鲜、美国经济互助协定”。为了彻底的奴役南朝鲜，他们在汉城组织了“经济援助局”，名义上是为了领导南朝鲜经济复兴而设立的。
    但是，这个机关变成了从多灾多难的南朝鲜人民身上榨取数百万资金的工具。在一九四九年下半年美国放给李承晚的六千万美元“信用贷款”中，百分之二十用在维持“经济援助局”机关，支付海运费及其他开支。因此，美国人在各种服务的形式下，取回了一千余万美元。仅有五十六万美元，即“信用贷款”总额的百分之一弱，用在机器设备上。但是，美国帝国主义却向全世界叫嚣着说：他们是在复兴南朝鲜的经济呢。
    事实上，南朝鲜的经济处于非常严重的情况。一九四五年八月的纸币流通总额，没有超过八十万万元，现在却远超过了七百万万元以上。市场为美、日工业商品所充塞。劳动者购买力极低，而农业不振，农产品价格飞涨。一个单位的米（七公斤）价值二千元。生产品奇缺，使人民生活颇感困难。
    甚至像“经济援助局”的班斯那样的骗子，也无法否认美国帝国主义对南朝鲜“援助”的恶果。班斯向国会所作的十二月报告中说：“朝鲜政府的财政情况，近来剧烈恶化了。政府对朝鲜银行的债务，达到了七百九十万万元，与年初相较增加了二百五十万万元”（一九五○年一月二十五日《联合新闻》报）。
    但是，尽管美帝对李承晚“政府”的援助遭到了这样的失败，美国还是决定一九五○年二月再拨给六千万美元的“信用贷款”。
    历史发展的过程说明：既然六十亿美元不能把蒋介石从难以避免的崩溃中挽救出来，同样任何的贷款，也不能拯救李承晚的腐朽制度。但是，美国帝国主义没有止步。“经济援助局”的成立对于华尔街的老板们是不能满足的。最近，他们组成了所谓“朝鲜财政经济问题委员会”。按照这个“委员会”所规定的经济政策，最高经济权力掌握在所谓“共和国总统”李承晚的手里。“委员会”的权限，包括一切经济财政的范畴，为了便于领导国民经济，创立了十三个部：如“工业设备”部，“食物部”，“预算部”，“财产赔偿部”等。“委员会”由五个美国人和三个“朝鲜政府”部长组成。这个事实说明，美国的统治已经深入一切南朝鲜经济事业之中了。
    北朝鲜人民更紧密地团结在以人民领袖和英雄金日成为首的人民民主共和国政府的周围，要为祖国的统一供献全部的力量。北朝鲜人民为了要巩固自力所实现的民主改革，为了要完成和超过二年人民经济计划，正在忘我地战斗着。南朝鲜人民，认识了美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚集团的真正面目，愈益广泛地展开了游击战，争取祖国的自由独立，要把人民叛徒及其美国主子完全赶出去。
