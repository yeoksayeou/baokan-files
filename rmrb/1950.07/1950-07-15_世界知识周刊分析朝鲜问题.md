　　World Knowledge Weekly Analyzes the Korean Issue
The second issue of the 22nd volume of World Knowledge Weekly was published on July 14th. To keep pace with the international situation, recent issues of World Knowledge have focused on the Korean issue. This issue's editorial, titled "The Illegality of the Security Council's Resolution on the Korean Issue Under U.S. Imperialist Coercion," vehemently condemns U.S. imperialism and the Security Council it manipulates. The special article, "Several Questions Concerning U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against Korea" by Zhang Mingyang, analyzes the entire Korean situation. Finally, in the International Issues Q&A column, Mr. Chen Hanbo, based on materials from a certain symposium discussion, answers the following questions: "Why did the Korean People's Army launch a counter-offensive so quickly? Isn't the force pressing down on the Korean people even greater now? Who is helping North Korea? Should China and the Soviet Union participate in the war? What if the situation turns against North Korea? Is this the Third World War?"

　　世界知识周刊分析朝鲜问题
    第廿二卷第二期世界知识周刊于七月十四日出版。为了配合国际局势，最近各期世界知识的重点放在朝鲜问题上，这期社评题为“美帝挟持下安理会对朝鲜问题决议的非法性”，痛斥美帝及其操纵下的安理会。专论有张明养的《关于美帝侵略朝鲜的几个问题》，分析了整个朝鲜的局势。最后，在国际问题解答栏内，由陈翰伯先生根据某处座谈会讨论材料，回答下面几个问题：“朝鲜人民军为什么这么快就发动了反攻？压在朝鲜人民头上的力量不是更大了吗？是谁在帮助北朝鲜呀？中苏是不是应该参战？假如战局对北朝鲜不利怎么办？这就是第三次世界大战吗？”
