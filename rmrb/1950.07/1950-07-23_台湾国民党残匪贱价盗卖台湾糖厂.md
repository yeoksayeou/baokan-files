Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 22nd: It has been learned here that the Kuomintang remnant bandits in Taiwan are selling a Taiwan sugar factory to Thailand at a rock-bottom price. The sugar factory originally belonged to the puppet Resources Committee and has been in operation for three years. All the machinery has now been secretly transported to Hong Kong by the bandit gang in advance, and the terms of the sale are being negotiated.

This sale is being conducted by the bandit gang's "Nanyang Enterprise Co., Ltd." in Hong Kong, and Gao Lingbai, the former Kuomintang bandit consul-general in Singapore, and four others arrived in Bangkok in early May to negotiate with the Thai Ministry of Industry. The bandit gang originally asked for 345,000 pounds and insisted on full payment in US dollars, but the Thai side did not agree. Because the bandits were eager to sell, they sent another letter to the Thai Ministry of Industry on June 7, offering to reduce the price to 300,000 pounds. The "transaction" of selling this national property is currently still under negotiation.

　　台湾国民党残匪贱价盗卖台湾糖厂
    【新华社广州二十二日电】此间获悉：台湾国民党残匪正以贱价盗卖台湾糖厂一座予泰国。该糖厂原属伪资源委员会，开办已三年。现全部机器已被匪帮先期偷运至香港，盗卖条件正在商谈中。
    此项盗卖行为系由匪帮在香港的“南洋企业有限公司”出面，并由国民党匪帮前驻星洲总领事高凌百等五人于五月初抵达曼谷与泰国实业部进行商谈。匪帮原索价三十四万五千英镑，并坚持全部由美元偿付，但泰国方面未表同意。匪方因盗卖心切，于六月七日再函泰国实业部，愿落价为三十万英镑。现该项盗卖国产的“交易”，正在继续谈判中。
