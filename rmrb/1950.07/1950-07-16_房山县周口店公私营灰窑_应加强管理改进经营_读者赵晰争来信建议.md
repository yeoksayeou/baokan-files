Fangshan County Zhoukoudian Public-Private Lime Kilns
    Should Strengthen Management and Improve Operations
    Reader Zhao Xizheng Sends Letter Suggesting
    To the Editor:
    West of Zhoukoudian Village in Fangshan County, Hebei Province, there is a mountain that produces natural bluestone, which can be used to burn lime and manufacture cement and bleaching powder. Each year, more than 100,000 tons of stone are mined, and nearly 10,000 tons of lime are burned. More than two thousand laborers and one hundred and several dozen rubber-wheeled carts from the nearby villages of Zhoukoudian, Xinjie, Xinzhuang, Hanji, and Louzishui participate in this production.
    However, there are some problems in production here:
    (1) In addition to the cement plant led by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, there are also the public-owned North China and Yongmao Construction Companies, the Beijing Dredging Bureau's lime-burning plant, and the Ministry of Public Security's North China Enterprise Company. The purpose is to solve the problem of lime for construction within their own units, or to undertake the construction of houses. According to Xia Zhenjia of Yongmao Company, the North China Company and the Beijing Dredging Bureau's lime-burning plant set up their own stalls to produce lime because they suffered too much from purchasing in the market. However, according to statistics, the production volume of the above four units in the first half of this year was less than three thousand tons. Thus, each setting up its own stall inevitably wastes manpower and disperses funds.
    In order to overcome this unnecessary waste, I suggest that relevant departments designate a department, or that the above departments cooperate in operation, to establish a professional institution in Zhoukoudian, concentrate funds to improve production equipment, build necessary warehouses, and make long-term plans. Cadres can also be used centrally, so that they can accumulate experience and improve management. In terms of sales, certain order relationships can be established through the Beijing-Tianjin Trust Department and the construction system, and develop towards centralization and specialization.
    (2) In addition, there are more than fifty private kiln owners in the local area. This has played a significant role in supplying social needs and organizing mass production. However, they also have many problems in production and sales. For example, this year, the Tianjin Office of the Chemical Industry Bureau ordered 500 tons of lime from the private Zhonghexing, but by the completion date, only one-tenth had been delivered. The main reason for this is that the company has neither a stone mountain nor sufficient funds. It is said that Tianjin China Textile Company also encountered a similar situation when ordering lime in Zhoukoudian. I believe that the government should provide them with necessary leadership and appropriate management, such as conducting registration, and imposing restrictions or other handling methods on certain companies with insufficient capital or extremely poor credit.
    (3) Except for two production cooperatives in Xinjie and Xinzhuang villages, a common problem for both public and private kiln industries is that there are no fixed workers. Wages are also extremely disparate. During the slack farming season, wages are as low as five or four sheng of corn per worker; during the busy farming season, even if wages are raised to more than one dou of corn per worker, it is still difficult to hire workers. This causes labor and production to be disconnected, and the masses cannot have normal wage income.
    Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to organize the labor force through the district and village people's governments or cooperatives, and provide regular production to various public and private kilns. At the same time, agree on wages for different seasons, so that, on the one hand, farmers participating in lime-burning production can obtain a certain wage, and on the other hand, production can be in a normal state.

　　房山县周口店公私营灰窑
    应加强管理改进经营
    读者赵晰争来信建议编辑同志：
    河北房山县周口店村西有一座产天然青石的山，可烧石灰及制造水泥、漂白粉。每年开凿石头十万余吨，烧灰近万吨。附近的周口店、新街、新庄、韩继、娄子水村的两千多个劳动力和一百几十辆胶皮大车，都参加了这一生产。
    但这里在生产中存在一些问题：
    （一）这里除重工业部领导的水泥厂以外，还有公营华北、永茂两建筑公司，北京清管局的烧灰厂和公安部的华北企业公司。目的是解决本单位建筑用灰，或承揽修盖房屋使用。据永茂公司夏振家说：华北公司和北京清管局烧灰厂因为在市场采购，吃亏太多，才自己设摊制灰。但据统计，以上四个单位今年上半年的生产量未及三千吨。这样，各家设摊，就必然浪费人力和分散资金。
    为克服这种不必要的浪费，我建议有关部门指定一个部门，或由上述部门合作经营，在周口店设立专业机构，集中资金改善生产设备，修盖必要的仓库，作长期的打算。干部也可集中使用，使之能积累经验，改进经营。在销售方面可通过京津信托部门和建筑系统，建立一定的定货关系，向集中和专业化的道路上发展。
    （二）另外，当地共有五十多家私营窑户。这在供给社会需要和组织群众生产上都起了不小作用。但它们在产销上也存在着不少问题。如今年化学工业局天津办事处，向私营中和兴定购五百吨石灰，到完货日，只交货十分之一。其主要原因就是因为该号既无石山，又无充足的资金。据说天津中纺公司在周口店定灰，也发生了类似的情形。我以为政府对他们要进行必要的领导和适当的管理。如举行登记，对某些资本不足或信用极坏的公司给以限制或其他的处理办法。
    （三）除新街、新庄村有两个生产合作社外，公私营窑业的一个共通问题是：没有固定的工人。工资亦极为悬殊，农闲时，每工工资低到五升或四升玉米；农忙时，即使每工工资提升到一斗多玉米，还雇不到工人。使劳动力和生产处于脱节的状态，群众也不能有正常的工资收入。
    因此，我认为有必要通过区村人民政府或合作社把劳动力组织起来，定期给各公私营窑场生产。同时议定不同季节的工资，这样一方面可使参加烧灰生产的农民获得一定的工资，另一方面使生产处于正常的状态。
