Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th. Student summer activities in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces will focus on studying the Land Reform Law. The Departments of Culture and Education, the Working Committees of the Communist Youth League, and the Student Unions of the aforementioned three provinces have jointly issued notices successively, arranging student work during the summer vacation in accordance with the above spirit.

Jiangxi Province has decided to cooperate with relevant parties in major cities to organize unified leadership institutions for student summer work and to hold summer youth academies. In economically viable areas, training classes for youth league branch cadres of schools will be held to study the Land Reform Law and summarize student work experiences. Before returning home, students will be ideologically mobilized and receive short-term land reform education and production policy education to raise their awareness, prevent influence from landlord ideology, and assist local governments in their work. Publicly funded students remaining on campus during the summer will be organized into work teams to go to the countryside to promote the Land Reform Law to farmers and to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as poor farmers, with production.

The Hunan Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League have instructed all areas to first organize learning in the form of summer youth academies, study groups, or study classes; secondly, to organize student rural service teams to carry out publicity on the Land Reform Law and other policies of the People's Government in rural areas.

　　湘鄂赣三省学生暑期活动
    以学习土地改革法为中心
    部分学生将组织工作队下乡宣传
    【新华社汉口十二日电】江西、湖南、湖北三省学生暑期活动以学习土地改革法为中心。上述三省人民政府文教厅、青年团工作委员会和学生联合会已先后联合发出通知，依照上述精神布置暑假学生工作。
    江西省决定在较大的城市，配合各有关方面组织暑期学生工作的统一领导机构，举办暑期青年学园。在经济条件许可的地区举办学校青年团支部干部训练班，学习土地改革法和总结学生工作经验。对回乡学生，在离校前要进行思想动员，并进行短期的土地改革教育和生产政策教育，使其在认识上提高一步，不受地主思想的影响并协助当地政府进行工作。对部分暑期留校的公费生，要组织下乡工作队，下乡向农民宣传土地改革法，并帮助革命烈士、军人的家属和贫苦农民生产。
    湖南省文教厅及青年团省工委指示各地首先采取暑假青年学园或学习团、学习班等形式，组织学习；其次，要组织学生农村服务队，在农村中进行土地改革法及人民政府其他各项政策的宣传。留校学生则组织各种学习互助小组，进行留校学习或工作。
    湖北省的通知规定根据不同情况，以土地改革教育或以时事教育和历史唯物论基本问题的教育为学生暑期学习的中心。
