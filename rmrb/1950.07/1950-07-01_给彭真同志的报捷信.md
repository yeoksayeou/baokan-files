　　A Report of Victory to Comrade Peng Zhen
    [This newspaper's report] The entire staff of the Shijingshan Power Plant sent a letter to Comrade Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The original text is as follows: Comrade Peng Zhen:
    "July 1st" has arrived. Under your leadership, over the past few months, we have finally resolved the issue of coal dust leakage from the pulverized coal furnace at the power plant before "July 1st." This ensures that the people near Shijingshan are no longer troubled by coal dust and can breathe fresh air all day long; at the same time, the electrical equipment and machinery of the plant will suffer less unnecessary damage. While solving the problem of coal dust leakage, we also adjusted the coal pulverizer, and the proportion of steel balls was fixed.
    In June, we signed a plant-wide collective contract and then launched a production competition. In this month, we collectively proposed 150 new records, rationalization proposals, and technological improvements. The plant's democratic management is also very good. You have called for all of these. We have successfully completed the June production plan, and many parts have exceeded the quota.
          We wish you good health!
    The entire staff of the Shijingshan Power Plant
    June 29th

　　给彭真同志的报捷信
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂全体职工给北京市总工会主席彭真同志的信，原文如下：彭真同志：
    “七一”来到了。我们在你的领导下，几个月来把发电厂煤粉炉跑煤粉的事儿，到底在“七一”前解决了。这就使得石景山左近的人民，再也不受煤粉的欺负，能整天呼吸到新鲜的空气了；同时厂子的电气设备和机器的安全上，也减少了不应受的损失。我们在解决跑煤粉的工作里，捎带着把磨煤机也调整了，钢球的比例有了定额。
    六月份我们签订了全厂性的集体合同，跟着展开生产竞赛，在这月里我们共提出了一百五十件创造新纪录、合理化建议和技术改进。厂里的民主管理也是挺好的。这些你都号召过。六月份的生产计划我们已胜利地完成，不少部分是超额完成了。          祝你身体健康！
    石景山发电厂全体职工
    六月二十九日
