　　The United States is Using the UN Flag
    Organizing a Gangster Alliance to Invade Korea
    Pravda Condemns US Imperialism for Undermining the UN
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 11th] According to TASS, Moscow: Pravda published an article on the 10th by its New York correspondents Rasadin and Filippov, entitled "Intervention Under the Flag of the United Nations." The article stated: The US government, which is waging open war against the Korean people, is trying to use the United Nations to cover up its new adventure.
    The main organ of the United Nations—the Security Council—is practically paralyzed and powerless. The US policy of destroying the United Nations has made it impossible for two permanent members of the Council—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—to participate in the Security Council. The representatives of the majority of the Council members are directly dependent on the United States. The remnants of the half-destroyed Security Council are being used by the US aggressor group to justify their criminal role as gendarmes in Korea and other Asian countries. The American aggressors are acting tyrannically and shamelessly in the United Nations.
    On July 7th, a shameful new farce was staged at Lake Success, a play pre-arranged by the US State Department. On that day, the Security Council passed another "resolution" stipulating that the US aggressive forces in Korea would fight behind the mask of a "unified command," which would act under the so-called "UN authorization." For this purpose, troops from certain other countries will be used to dilute the American aggressive forces. In this way, they are attempting to organize an imperialist gangster alliance under the flag of the United Nations in order to subject the Korean people to slaughter and destruction. The authors pointed out that the drafters of the above-mentioned "resolution," which is extremely servile and shameless, want to stain the flag of the United Nations and use it to cover up the US aggression against the Korean people and other peoples of Asia. This extremely shameless "resolution" is illegal and insults the United Nations itself, because the responsibility of the United Nations is to fight for peace and the security of the people, not to encourage warmongers.

　　美国正利用联合国旗帜
    组织强盗联盟侵略朝鲜
    真理报斥美帝破坏联合国
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十日刊载了该报驻纽约记者拉萨丁和菲列波夫所撰题为《在联合国的旗帜下进行的干涉》一文。该文略称：对朝鲜人民进行公开战争的美国政府，正力图利用联合国来掩盖其新的冒险。
    联合国的主要机构——安理会——实际上已陷于瘫痪和没有权力。美国的毁灭联合国的政策，使得两个常任理事国——苏联和中华人民共和国——不可能参加安理会。安理会多数理事国的代表是直接依附美国的。半被摧毁的安理会的残余部分，正被美国侵略集团用来辩护他们在朝鲜和其他亚洲国家所扮演的宪兵的犯罪角色。美国侵略者正在联合国里横暴地、厚颜无耻地行动着。
    七月七日，成功湖上演了一出可耻的新滑稽剧，这出戏是按照美国国务院预先安排的计划演出的。那一天，安理会又通过了一个“决议”，规定在朝鲜的美国侵略军指挥部将在“统一指挥部”的假面具后面作战，而后者是在所谓“联合国授权”下行动的。为了这个目的，将用某些其它国家的队伍来冲淡美国侵略军。这样，他们正企图在联合国的旗帜下组织一个帝国主义强盗联盟，以便使朝鲜人民遭受屠杀和毁灭。作者指出，奴颜婢膝和无耻到极点的上述“决议”的起草人，想沾污联合国的旗帜，并利用它来掩护美国对朝鲜人民和亚洲其它人民的侵略。这个极端无耻的“决议”是不合法的，并且它侮辱了联合国本身，因为联合国的责任本是为和平和人民的安全而斗争，而不是鼓励战争挑拨者的。
