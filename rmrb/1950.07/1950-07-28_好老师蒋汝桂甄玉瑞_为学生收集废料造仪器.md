　　Good Teachers Jiang Rugui and Zhen Yurui
    Collect Waste Materials to Make Instruments for Students
    The Xuzhou Railway No. 2 Primary School, which educates the children of railway employees, suffers from poor teaching tools and equipment. Teaching natural science requires a special emphasis on experiments, but due to the lack of instruments and specimens, even though the teachers explain repeatedly, the children can only get a vague impression. This made teachers Jiang Rugui and Zhen Yurui very uncomfortable, feeling that such teaching was a failure and needed to be remedied.

    "We must be responsible for the next generation of New China!" In order to solve the instrument problem, Jiang Rugui specifically went to his colleague Zhen Yurui. After discussion and research, they initially drafted a plan: "Use waste materials, squeeze out spare time, use minimal school funds, and make 25 kinds of instruments." After obtaining the principal's consent, they began to find ways to manufacture them. After school, they often went to the junk market. Small screws, broken clocks, gears, incomplete instruments... were selectively bought. In this way, waste materials bought for 200,000 to 300,000 yuan were processed and transformed into teaching instruments worth 3.5 million yuan.

    Starting from March 1st, they often didn't sleep until late at night. Sometimes, in order to assemble the instruments, they worked from night until dawn, and after a short rest, they still went to school to teach as usual.

    Through careful research and hard work, their first plan was successfully completed. From March 1st to 20th, they made a total of 29 instruments, including a steam engine model, an artificial rainbow experiment apparatus, pulleys, a moving picture machine, a voltaic battery, a generator, and a telephone. As a result, they were welcomed by the students and encouraged by the teachers. After receiving these encouragements, they drafted a second plan: to focus on trial-producing more complex things.

    Before this year's May Day, Jiang Rugui and Zhen Yurui had produced as many as 62 finished instruments, and there were also many animal, insect, and plant specimens. At the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's model worker election conference, they were gloriously elected as model teachers. From then on, the teachers took them as examples, and the children called them "good teachers."

　　好老师蒋汝桂甄玉瑞
    为学生收集废料造仪器
    培养铁路员工子弟的徐州铁路第二小学校，因为教学工具与各种设备都很差，教自然科学这门功课，要特别着重实验，但因没有仪器、标本，教师虽然讲解再三，孩子们只能得到模糊的印象。这使教师蒋汝桂和甄玉瑞非常难受，感到这样的教学是失败的，需要设法补救。
    “我们要对新中国的后一代负责！”蒋汝桂为了解决仪器问题，特地去找他的同伴甄玉瑞。他俩经过讨论，研究，初步拟定了一个计划：“利用废料，挤出业余时间，少用校方经费，制作仪器二十五种。”在取得校长同意后，他们便开始设法制造。他们于放学后常到破烂市上去串。小螺丝钉、破钟表、齿轮、残缺仪器…被他们有选择地加以收买。这样，花了二三十万元买来的废料，经过加工改造，便制成价值三百五十万元的教学仪器。
    从三月一日开始，他们每晚都在深夜才睡。有时候为了装制仪器，从夜晚一直工作到天亮，休息了没多会，又照样到校上课。
    经过细心钻研与努力，他俩的第一个计划胜利完成了。从三月一号到二十号，总共制成了蒸气机模型、人造虹实验器、滑车、活动电影机、弗打电池、发电机、电话器等二十九件仪器，因此得到同学的欢迎和教员们的勉励。他俩得到这些鼓励之后，又拟出了第二个计划：有重点地试制更复杂的东西。
    今年五一节前，蒋汝桂、甄玉瑞的仪器成品已达六十二件之多，另外还有很多兽类、昆虫、植物标本。在郑州路局选举劳动模范大会上，他俩光荣地被选为模范教师。从此，教员们把他俩作为榜样，孩子们唤他俩“好老师”。
