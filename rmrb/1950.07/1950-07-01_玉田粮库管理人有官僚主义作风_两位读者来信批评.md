　　The Grain Depot Manager in Yutian Has a Bureaucratic Work Style

　　Two Readers' Letters of Criticism

Comrade Editor:

　　The father of Liu Zhihe, a demobilized soldier from Jia Zhuangzi in the Eleventh District of Yutian, went to the County Civil Affairs Section on June 19th to collect preferential treatment grain for revolutionary martyrs' families and soldiers (525 jin of millet). The Civil Affairs Section originally stipulated that this grain would be distributed on the 10th, 20th, and 30th of each month. Because it wasn't the designated day, he had to return home. On the 21st, Liu Zhihe's father went to collect the grain again. The comrade in charge of the depot said, "The depot can't be opened after the designated days; we'll talk about it next time." Liu Zhihe's father had spent two dou of corn to hire livestock and a cart this time, and if he couldn't get the grain, the corn would be wasted. He went to the Civil Affairs Section, and they called the grain depot, explaining that Liu's family was in dire straits and asked the comrade in charge to give him the grain. The comrade in charge of the depot still refused to open the depot, saying that "a small amount isn't worth issuing." Finally, with no other recourse, he was so worried that he kept pacing on the street. At this moment, Ma Wanqing, the director of the county Public Security Bureau, happened to pass by and, seeing that the old man looked very distressed, asked him why he was so upset. The old man told him about his experience of collecting the grain. Comrade Wanqing went with him to the Civil Affairs Section, and the comrades there called the depot again. This time, the depot's response was, "Let's study it and talk about it later." It was after 4 p.m., the time for opening the depot to collect grain. The old man was very happy, thinking that it could be issued to him then. However, the comrade in charge of the depot said angrily to him, "You even got someone to pull strings (referring to Director Ma)? What's the use of that? The designated days have passed, and I definitely won't give it to you. Talk about it next month!" He had no choice but to return home that night with tears in his eyes.

　　We believe that it is right for the grain depot to distribute grain on time, but it should also take into account the difficulties of individual grain recipients. We hope that the comrade in charge of the depot will overcome this bureaucratic attitude.

　　Tian Runmin Chen Tong

　　Editor's Note: The person in charge of this grain depot should immediately examine this extremely bad style and its ideological source, and publish it in this newspaper. It is hoped that the Civil Affairs Section of Yutian County will check and urge him to conduct a self-criticism and correct his mistakes.

### 玉田粮库管理人有官僚主义作风  两位读者来信批评

　　玉田粮库管理人有官僚主义作风
    两位读者来信批评编辑同志：
    玉田十一区贾庄子退伍军人刘志和的父亲，在六月十九日到县民政科领取荣军优待粮（小米五百二十五斤）。此项粮食民政科原规定在每月十日、二十、三十日三天发放，因这次没到日子，他只好回去了。二十一号刘志和的父亲又去领粮。管库的同志说：过了日子不能开库，下次再说吧。”刘志和的父亲因这次的牲口和车是花了二斗玉米雇来的，要是再领不到，玉米就白花了。他找到民政科，民政科给粮库打电话，说明刘家情况很困难，要管库的同志把粮发给他。管库的同志仍说不能开库，认为“一份半份不值一领”。最后他实在没法可想，竟在街上愁的直转。此时恰好该县公安局长马万青走过，看见老头脸色很难看，便问他为啥这样难过。老头就把领粮经过告诉了他。万青同志即同他去找民政科。科里同志又给库方打电话。库方这次的答复是：“等研究研究再说吧。”午后四点多钟，正是开库取粮的时候。老头很高兴，以为可以顺便发给他了。可是管库的同志愤愤地对他说：“你还托了个门子（指马局长）？那顶啥？日子过了，坚决不给你。下月再说吧！”他只好含着两眶眼泪，连夜赶回家去。
    我们认为：粮库按时发放粮食是对的，但也要照顾个别领粮者的困难。希望管库的同志克服这种官僚主义的态度。

    编者按：这位管库的人应该立即检讨这种极端恶劣的作风和思想根源，在本报公布。并望玉田县民政科检查与督促他进行检讨和改正错误。
