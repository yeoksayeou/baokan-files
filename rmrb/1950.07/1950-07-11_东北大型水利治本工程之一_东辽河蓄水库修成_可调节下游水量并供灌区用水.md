　　Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau Communications Group Report: One of the large-scale fundamental water conservancy projects in Northeast China, the Erlongshan Reservoir on the Dongliao River, was completed in late May. Together with the existing Xiaofengman, Jingpo Lake, and Naodehai Reservoirs, Northeast China now has four major reservoirs.
　　The Erlongshan Reservoir project plays a decisive role in the overall Liao River fundamental treatment plan. The project includes the construction of a dam across the river at Erlongshan in Lishu County, and the construction of an artificial reservoir upstream of the dam. The reservoir controls a total drainage area of ​​3,794 square kilometers upstream, and the reservoir inundation area is 121 square kilometers. The dam body is an earth dam, with a concrete core wall built inside, and a 56.5-meter-long concrete spillway dam. The lower part is the water-blocking part, and the upper part is the gate. It regularly maintains a water storage capacity of 620 million cubic meters. When the water level is too high, it overflows. In the event of a flood, the gate can be lowered to increase the capacity by 318 million cubic meters. There is also a sloping tower-shaped discharge gate, with machinery inside the tower that can discharge water into irrigation canals or other water stations as needed.
　　The Dongliao River was originally the most disaster-prone major tributary in the Liao River system, originating from the Hasaling Mountains in the eastern part of Xi'an County and flowing into the Liao River at Kuyushu. The river basin spans the three provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Jilin, occupying eight counties including Xi'an and Xifeng, with a drainage area of ​​10,317 square kilometers. In the past, floods often caused great disasters. According to statistics from 1935 and 1937, the area of ​​inundated land reached 2.8 million mu. The completion of the Erlongshan Reservoir project can eliminate the above-mentioned areas from flooding, and can ensure the supply of industrial and agricultural water and urban drinking water in the basin, and has a great effect on regulating floods in the entire downstream of the Liao River.
　　In order to utilize the water in the Erlongshan Reservoir, the diversion works of the irrigation area built at Yangjiachuankou in the lower reaches of the Dongliao River began construction last spring and are now mostly completed. The irrigation area can irrigate 24,000 hectares of rice fields. After the project is fully completed, it can turn 15,000 hectares of dry land into paddy fields. The above-mentioned 2.8 million mu of land will no longer be flooded, and with the addition of 90,000 mu of reclaimed land, more than 37,000 tons of coarse grains can be harvested annually.

　　东北大型水利治本工程之一
    东辽河蓄水库修成
    可调节下游水量并供灌区用水
    【本报沈阳讯】东北水利总局通讯组报导：东北大型水利治本工程之一——东辽河二龙山蓄水库，已于五月下旬修建完成。加上原有的小丰满、镜泊湖、闹得海等水库，东北已拥有四大水库。
    二龙山蓄水库的工程，在整个辽河治本计划中，有决定性的作用。该工程包括在梨树县境二龙山修建拦河坝一道，于该坝上游建造人工蓄水库一座。水库上游控制流域面积共三千七百九十四平方公里，水库漫水面积一百二十一平方公里。拦河坝身是土坝，坝内筑有混凝土心壁，并筑有五十六点五米长的混凝土滚水坝。下部是拦水部分，上面是闸门。它经常保持用水量六点二亿立方米。水位过高时便溢流而下。洪水时一旦发生水灾，便放下闸门，可增加容量三点一八亿立方米。另有斜塔形放水闸，塔内有机械，可以按需要任意放水入灌溉道或其他用水站。
    东辽河原来是辽河水系中最容易发生祸患的大支流，发源于西安县东部之哈萨岭，于枯榆树注入辽河。该河流域跨辽东、辽西、吉林三省，占有西安、西丰等八县，流域面积一万零三百一十七方公里。过去时常因洪水酿成巨灾。据一九三五年及一九三七年统计，淹地面积达二百八十万亩。二龙山水库工程的完成，可免除以上地区的水患，并能确保流域内的工、农业用水及都市饮料水的供给，对整个辽河下游洪水之调节有极大作用。
    为了利用二龙山蓄水库里的水，在东辽河下游杨家船口修建的灌区渠首工程，已在去春动工，现已大部完成。该灌区可灌溉稻田二万四千垧。工程全部完成后，可使一万五千垧旱田变为水田。上述二百八十万亩地又不受水淹，再加垦荒九万亩，每年可收粗粮三万七千多吨。
