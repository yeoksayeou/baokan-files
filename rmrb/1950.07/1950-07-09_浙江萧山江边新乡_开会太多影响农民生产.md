　　Zhejiang Xiaoshan Jiangbian Xinxiang
    Too Many Meetings Affect Farmers' Production
    To the Editor:
    The June 14th "Zhejiang Daily" reported that in the twelve administrative villages of Xinxiang, Jiangbian, Changhe District, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, there are too many meetings and too few problems solved, which affects farmers' production. I think this is a problem worthy of attention, and I hope you will publish it.
    This village has a total of four natural villages. Taking the smallest natural village, Shiban Zhuang, as an example, from the first to the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month, in half a month, the villagers participated in three full administrative village meetings, two village meetings, three women's meetings, three children's meetings, five mutual aid team meetings, and four meetings for cadres above the team leader level. In addition to attending general meetings, committee members also went to the township government for meetings twice and held meetings with a work team from another village three times. In half a month, there were twenty-five meetings, large and small, averaging almost two meetings every day.
    The way the meetings are conducted is to gather the masses, and the work cadres give a long speech, making everyone exhausted and drowsy. As a result, many people leave before the meeting is over. For example, in Zhangjiaxi Natural Village, a village meeting was held. Out of fifty-four households, about fifty men and women attended. Halfway through the meeting, half of the people left, and only a dozen people remained by the end of the meeting.
    The content of the meetings lacks focus, and everything is discussed, making the meetings fruitless. For example, on May 29th, the work team held a village cadre meeting to deploy work. It lasted from 7:00 to 11:00, a full four hours, and deployed seven or eight tasks, including checking qualified rice fields, summer harvest, summer planting, seed selection, water conservancy construction, waterwheel repair, and selecting models. Village cadres work hard all day, and they cannot persevere when the meeting is too long. After the meeting, it was found that most of the tasks assigned at the meeting were not implemented.
    At present, the rural areas are in the most intense and arduous season of summer harvest, summer cultivation, and summer planting. Cadres wholeheartedly want to organize the masses and improve production, but as a result, too many meetings, and poorly conducted meetings, affect the mood of the masses and affect production. The example written above is not an isolated case. In the vast new rural areas, especially in some key rural villages, this phenomenon is still very common. This phenomenon must be corrected. The way to correct it is not to stop holding meetings, but to reduce meetings. Unnecessary meetings, meetings that can be postponed, and meetings that can be merged should not be held. Only truly necessary meetings should be held, and the meetings should have a central focus. During the busy farming season, the duration of the meetings should be shortened as much as possible so that each meeting can truly gather everyone's opinions and effectively solve problems.

### 浙江萧山江边新乡  开会太多影响农民生产

　　浙江萧山江边新乡
    开会太多影响农民生产编辑同志：
    六月十四日《浙江日报》消息：浙江萧山长河区江边新乡十二行政村，开会多，解决问题少，影响农民生产。我认为这是值得注意的问题，希望你们把它发表出来。
    这个村子共四个自然村。仅以最小的一个自然村石板庄来说，自阴历四月初一到十五，半个月内，全村群众曾参加全行政村大会三次，本村村民会二次，妇女会三次，儿童会三次，伴工组会五次，组长以上干部会四次；委员除参加一般会议外，又赴乡政府开会二次，和另一个村的工作组开会三次。半月之中召开了大大小小的会议二十五次，平均几乎每天要开两个会。
    开会方式，是将群众召集起来，由工作干部先讲一大套，使大家听得精疲力乏，打瞌睡，结果许多人未开完会就走了。如张家西自然村召开村民会，五十四户人家，到会男女五十人左右，会开到一半，人也走了一半，到会议结束时，仅存十几个人。
    开会内容则没有中心，什么都谈，使会议毫无结果。如五月二十九日工作组召开村干会，布置工作，从七时开到十一时，足足开了四个钟头，布置了检查合式秧田、夏收、夏种、选种、兴修水利、修水车、选模范等七、八项工作。村干部因为白天整日劳动，会议一长，都坚持不下去。会后检查，会议所布置的工作大多没有贯彻。
    目前农村中正是夏收、夏耕、夏种生产最紧张最繁重的季节。干部一心一意想组织群众，提高生产，但结果因会议太多，而且开的不好，反而影响群众情绪，影响生产。上面所写的例子，并不是个别的，在广大的新区农村中，特别是在一些基点乡村中，还是很普遍的现象。这种现象是必须加以改正的。改正之道，不是不开会议，而是减少会议。不必要的、可缓开的、可合并的会不开，真正必要的会才开，而且开会要有中心内容，在农忙时，更要尽量缩短开会的时间。使每一次会议都真正能够集中大家的意见，有效的解决问题。
