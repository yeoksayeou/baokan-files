　　Municipal Health Committee Organizes Educational Film Teams
    To Show Movies in Suburban Districts to Promote Summer Hygiene Campaign
    [Beijing News Agency Report] The Beijing Municipal Health Committee has organized eight educational film teams from the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the National Normal University Educational Film Library, the Political Department of the Public Security Headquarters, the Department of Social Education of the Central Ministry of Education, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Municipality, the Film Studio of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Youth Service Department, and the private Kongde Middle School. Each team will dedicate a portion of their time to cooperate with the publicity and mobilization efforts of the district health committees in the suburban districts by showing movies. In the first few days of establishing health committee organizations in each district, five screenings have already taken place, with a total audience of over 15,000 people. The films screened include health education films such as "Mosquitoes" and "White-Clad Soldiers." Before each screening, slides on eliminating flies, mosquitoes, and improving environmental hygiene are also shown, with explanations provided by local doctors. The audience believes this method is very good and effectively addresses everyone's concerns. Kongde Middle School has a projector and previously only operated within the school. This time, the school proactively contacted the Municipal Health Committee, hoping to cooperate with the summer hygiene publicity and education campaign outside the school. The Health Committee has decided to assist them in terms of films and funding. Currently, as the citywide summer hygiene campaign gradually unfolds, the activities of the educational film teams are also gradually expanding.

    【京市新闻处讯】北京市卫生委员会顷已把市文教局、国立师范大学电教馆、公安总队政治部、中央教育部社教司、市中苏友好协会、中央农业部电影社、青年服务部和私立孔德中学等八个电教队组织起来，各以一部分时间去城郊各区配合区卫生委员会的宣传动员工作，放映电影。在各区开始建立卫生委员会的组织的头几天，就已经放映了五场，观众共达一万五千余人。放映的片子有卫生教育影片《蚊子》和《白衣战士》等，每场之前并放映灭蝇、灭蚊和改善环境卫生的幻灯片，由当地的医生加以说明。观众都认为这种方式很好，很能解决大家的问题。孔德中学有一部放映机，过去只在校内活动，这次该校自动找到市卫生委员会，希望到校外来配合夏季卫生的宣传教育活动；卫生委员会已决定在片子和经费方面，对其加以协助。现在随着全市夏季卫生运动的日渐展开，电教队的活动也正在逐步开展中。
