Several Explanations Regarding the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations

Farmers' associations are mass organizations voluntarily formed by farmers. In old areas such as North China and Northeast China, farmers' associations have already completed their historical task of organizing farmers against feudal exploitation and even eliminating feudal exploitation. In new areas such as East China and Central South China, since liberation over a year ago, farmers' associations have been established successively in the movements of suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, reducing rent and refunding deposits, and production for disaster relief. According to materials from late May of this year, in East China and Central South China alone, there were 24 million members of farmers' associations. In the past two months, there has been a sharp increase, and the number of members in these two regions has reached more than 30 million. In some provinces, such as Zhejiang, all counties except for a few have convened county-wide farmer representative conferences, and some counties have held several conferences. The Zhejiang Provincial Farmer Representative Conference has also been held twice. In the Southwest and Northwest regions, farmers' associations are being established one after another. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party, the broad masses of farmers have organized themselves, taken action, and tempered themselves and grown stronger in the struggles of suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, reducing rent and refunding deposits, and in the production for disaster relief movement, preparing the necessary organizational groundwork for the large-scale land reform movement that will begin this autumn. This is something to be cherished.

On July 14th, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government passed the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations and promulgated it for implementation. We believe that this will enable farmers' associations and the broad masses of farmers in various regions to organize themselves and take action under unified tasks and unified organizational principles. This will be an important guarantee for the correct development of the land reform movement in the future.

What are the tasks of the farmers' association? Article 2 of Chapter 1 of the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations provides a clear and concise answer to this question: "A. Unite farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and all anti-feudal elements in rural areas, abide by the policies and decrees of the People's Government, and implement anti-feudal social reforms step by step to protect the interests of farmers. B. Organize farmers for production, organize rural cooperatives, develop agriculture and sideline occupations, and improve the lives of farmers. C. Safeguard the political rights of farmers, raise their political and cultural level, and participate in the construction of the people's democratic regime." This means that through anti-feudal social reforms, mainly through the land reform movement from opposing local bullies and reducing rent to distributing land, to fundamentally eliminate feudal forces from the economic base. It is necessary to raise the cultural level and political awareness of millions of farmers who have been under feudal oppression for thousands of years, who are culturally backward, and who have no habits of democratic life, and to safeguard their democratic and political rights, so that the democratization of our country can be deeply and thoroughly realized; because if the farmers who account for 80 percent of the population do not have a full democratic life, the democratization of our country cannot be fully realized. At the same time, it is also necessary to organize farmers for production through forms such as mutual aid teams and cooperatives (mainly rural supply and marketing cooperatives), develop agriculture and sideline occupations, so that impoverished farmers, after eliminating feudal exploitation of land ownership, and after obtaining land and other means of production, can work diligently to gradually enrich their lives. This is the path of struggle that the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations directs the broad masses of farmers to follow.

Who can join the farmers' association? Article 4 of Chapter 2 of the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations stipulates: "All farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, rural handicraftsmen, and poor revolutionary intellectuals in rural areas who voluntarily join the association may become members of the farmers' association after being approved by the rural farmers' association committee."

Some people ask, why is it stipulated that only poor revolutionary intellectuals can join the farmers' association? Can intellectuals from landlord families join the farmers' association? Why is it stipulated that rich peasants can only join the farmers' association after land reform is completed, but cannot join the farmers' association when land reform has not yet started or has started but has not yet been completed?

To answer this question, first, we must understand that before the completion of land reform, the farmers' association is a fighting organization of the peasant masses against feudalism. Land reform is to abolish a ruling class that has existed for thousands of years - the landlord class. The landlord class accounts for about 4 percent of the total rural population. As far as the areas in East China and Central South China where land reform will be implemented after this autumn are concerned, this area has a rural population of about 100 million, of which the landlord class accounts for about 4 million. As for the regions nationwide where land reform has not yet been implemented, there are about 264 million people, of which the landlord class accounts for more than 10 million. To abolish a class that has ruled for thousands of years, that economically controls the most important means of agricultural production - a large amount of land, and has a population of more than ten million, will undoubtedly be a fierce struggle. The farmers' association is a fighting organization to carry out such a fierce struggle. For anti-feudalism, the farmers' association is the fighting organization of the peasant class. In order to win the victory in the anti-feudal land reform struggle and ensure its smooth completion, the farmers' association cannot but demand organizational purity. Landlords, of course, cannot join the farmers' association. Chinese rich peasants generally also have a semi-feudal nature, which is prominently manifested in the fact that many rich peasants also rent out some land. Rich peasants have historically been linked to the landlord class in rural areas, and in the past land reform movement in the old liberated areas, rich peasants opposed land reform. In the future, the land reform movement in the vast new liberated areas will adopt the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy. Except for semi-landlord-style rich peasants who also rent out a large amount of land, "protect the land and other property owned by rich peasants who cultivate their own land and employ others, and shall not be infringed upon." This can achieve the purpose of neutralizing rich peasants and isolating landlords, but it can only neutralize rich peasants. It is impossible to expect the entire rich peasant class to actively oppose the landlord class along with the peasants. Past experience has shown that if rich peasants are absorbed into the farmers' association, the class front of the anti-feudal struggle will be confused. Moreover, after rich peasants enter the farmers' association, they are likely to use their economic power and historical social status in rural areas to actually gain leadership of the farmers' association, which will result in the land reform movement changing its face, or forming sectarian struggles and causing confusion, or being extremely incomplete, which will require a review or even a re-distribution of land, which is extremely unfavorable. Therefore, rich peasants cannot be allowed to join the farmers' association before land reform, or during land reform. As for those who require to join after the land reform is complete, according to Article 4 of Chapter 2 of the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations, after being approved by the rural farmers' conference or the rural farmers' representative conference, they can also become members of the farmers' association. Because, since land reform has been completed and the landlord class has been eliminated, there is no need to worry about the unfavorable situation of rich peasants joining the farmers' association. At that time, the central task of rural areas is to organize farmers for production and develop agriculture and sideline occupations, and allowing rich peasants to join the farmers' association is beneficial to rural production. At the same time, the political awareness of the broad masses of farmers tempered by land reform will inevitably be greatly improved, and the organization of farmers' associations will also be strengthened and improved in the struggle of land reform. By that time, there will be no harm in absorbing rich peasants into the farmers' association.

As for the question of whether intellectuals from landlord families can join the farmers' association, Article 4 of Chapter 2 of the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations stipulates: "All staff members assigned to rural areas to engage in the farmers' movement may join the farmers' association." This does not exclude intellectuals from landlord families. For example, among the 180,000 cadres prepared and trained in East China and Central South China for the land reform movement that will begin after this autumn, a large number are intellectuals from landlord families. For example, in the past land reform movement in the old liberated areas, many intellectuals from landlord families were also sent to rural areas to engage in the farmers' movement. Not only could they join the farmers' association, but some could also become cadres of the farmers' movement and gained the love of the peasant masses, because they tempered themselves and transformed themselves in the great fire of land reform. These revolutionary intellectuals from landlord families who have betrayed the landlord class and are determined to serve the people can join the farmers' association, and the peasants will not care about their family origin, and they will certainly allow them to join the farmers' association. In addition, there are some intellectuals from landlord families who have not separated from the landlord class. The farmers' association, as the legitimate executive organ for reforming the land system, the farmers' association that struggles to realize land reform, of course, cannot allow them to join, and they have no reason to demand to join. Can the farmers' association, the fighting organization to realize land reform, allow them to sneak in to steal leadership and sabotage land reform? Of course not.

Is it still necessary to organize poor peasant leagues after the farmers' association is organized? In old areas such as North China and Northeast China, poor peasant leagues were organized in the past when land reform was implemented, but experience has shown that the organization of poor peasant leagues hinders the unity of middle peasants. Therefore, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the land reform issue: In the future land reform movement, do not organize poor peasant leagues again. But does this mean that in the future land reform movement, we should not rely on poor peasants and farm laborers? No. Poor peasants and farm laborers are the most active in demanding reform of the land system, and the work of land reform must still rely on poor peasants and farm laborers. Chairman Mao instructed us in his speech at the cadre conference in Jin Sui, and Vice Chairman Liu also instructed us in his report on the land reform issue. Of course, relying on poor peasants and farm laborers must be combined with uniting middle peasants, and we should not excessively and inappropriately emphasize relying on poor peasants and farm laborers and neglect uniting middle peasants.

All rural staff in the new liberated areas, especially those preparing to participate in land reform, should carefully study the entire contents of the General Regulations for the Organization of Farmers' Associations. In places where farmers' associations have not yet been established but are preparing to carry out land reform, farmers' associations should be established according to correct organizational principles. In places where farmers' associations have already been established but their organizational composition and leadership composition are not very pure, they should be gradually purified in the process of implementing various rural tasks according to the promulgated organizational regulations. The farmers' association should clear out the landlord-rich peasant elements and their agents who have sneaked into the farmers' association, and even sneaked into the leading organs of the farmers' association, and truly grasp the leadership of the farmers' association in the hands of upright working farmers—farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants, so as to have the strength to enter the unprecedentedly large-scale land reform that will begin this autumn, and truly achieve the historical task of eliminating the land ownership of the landlord class and feudal exploitation in an organized and orderly manner.

　　关于农民协会组织通则的几点解释
    农民协会是农民自愿结合的群众组织。在华北、东北等老区，农民协会已经完成了组织农民反对封建剥削以至消灭封建剥削的历史任务。在华东、中南等新区，自解放迄今年余以来，各地也已在剿匪反霸、减租退租以及生产救灾运动中，先后成立了农民协会。据今年五月下旬的材料，单就华东、中南两区而言，农民协会会员已有二千四百万人，近两个月来，又有猛烈的增长，这两区的会员人数已达三千万以上。有些省份，例如浙江，除一二少数县份外，全省各县均已召开了全县农民代表大会，有的县已开过数次，浙江全省农民代表大会亦已开过两次。西南、西北两区，各地农民协会也正在纷纷成立。广大农民群众，已在共产党领导帮助之下，组织起来，行动起来，并在剿匪反霸、减租退租的斗争中，在生产救灾运动中，锻炼了自己，壮大了自己，为将在今年秋后开始的大规模的土地改革运动做了必要的组织准备。这是很值得珍视的。
    七月十四日，中央人民政府政务院政务会议通过了农民协会组织通则并予以公布施行。我们相信，这将使各地的农民协会与广大的农民群众在统一的任务和统一的组织原则之下，组织起来，行动起来。这对于今后土地改革运动的正确发展将是一个重要的保证。
    什么是农民协会的任务呢？农民协会组织通则第一章第二条对于这个问题做了明白简要的规定：“甲、团结雇农、贫农、中农及农村中一切反封建分子，遵照人民政府的政策法令，有步骤地实行反封建的社会改革，保护农民利益。乙、组织农民生产，组织农村合作社，发展农业和副业，改善农民生活。丙、保障农民的政治权利，提高农民的政治和文化水平，参加人民民主政权的建设工作。”这就是说，要经过反封建的社会改革，主要是经过从反霸、减租到分配土地的土地改革运动，从经济基础上根本消灭封建势力。要使几千年来处于封建淫威之下的，文化落后的，毫无民主生活习惯的千百万农民的文化水平提高起来，政治觉悟水平提高起来，保障他们的民主政治权利，使我们国家的民主化深入贯彻地实现；因为占人口百分之八十的农民如果还没有充分的民主生活，我们国家的民主化是不能完满实现的。同时，还要以变工队、合作社（主要形式是农村供销合作社）等方式，组织农民生产，发展农业和副业，使贫困的农民在消灭了封建剥削的土地所有制以后，在分得土地及其他生产资料以后，勤劳生产，使自己的生活逐步富裕起来。这是农民协会组织通则指示给广大农民的奋斗的道路。
    什么人可以参加农民协会呢？农民协会组织通则第二章第四条规定：“凡雇农、贫农、中农、农村手工业工人及农村中贫苦的革命知识分子，自愿入会者，得乡农民协会委员会批准后，即可成为农民协会会员。”
    有人问，为什么规定中只有贫苦的革命知识分子才可以加入农民协会呢？地主家庭出身的知识分子能否加入农民协会呢？为什么规定富农在土地改革完成以后才可以加入农民协会，而在土地改革尚未开始或虽已开始而尚未完成时不得加入农民协会呢？
    要回答这个问题，首先，我们要了解，在土地改革尚未完成以前，农民协会是农民群众反封建的战斗组织。土地改革是要废除一个几千年来的统治阶级——地主阶级。地主阶级在全部农村人口中约占百分之四。就今年秋后将在华东和中南两区中实行土地改革的地区而言，这个地区约有一万万农村人口，其中地主阶级的人口约占四百万人。至于全国尚未实行土地改革的地区，约有两万万六千四百万人口，其中地主阶级的人口约占一千余万人。要废除一个统治了几千年，经济上掌握着农业生产之最主要的生产资料——大量的土地，而人口又有千万以上的阶级，无疑问地，将是一场激烈的斗争。农民协会就是要进行这样一场激烈斗争的战斗组织。对反封建而言，农民协会是农民阶级的战斗组织。为了争取反封建的土地改革斗争的胜利并保证顺利的完成，农民协会不能不要求组织纯洁。地主当然是不能加入农民协会了。中国富农一般也带有半封建性，其突出的表现是许多富农兼出租一部分土地。富农在农村中历来是与地主阶级结合在一起的，在老解放区过去的土地改革运动中，富农是反对土地改革的。今后在广大新解放区中的土地改革运动，采取了保存富农经济的方针，除对兼有大量出租土地的半地主式的富农，征收其出租土地外，“保护富农所有的自耕和雇人耕种的土地及其他财产，不得侵犯”。这可以达到中立富农而孤立地主的目的，但也只能做到中立富农，要希望整个富农阶级和农民一道积极反对地主阶级，那是不可能的。过去的经验证明，如果把富农吸收到农民协会中来，那么反封建斗争的阶级阵线就混乱了。而且，富农进入农民协会之后，就很可能利用其在农村中的经济势力与历史传统的社会地位而实际取得农民协会的领导权，结果就会使土地改革运动改变了面貌，或者形成宗派斗争，引起混乱，或者极不彻底，结果就需要再来复查以至重新分配土地，这是极其不利的。所以，在土地改革以前以及在土地改革当中，都不能允许富农加入农民协会。至于在土地改革完成之后，富农要求加入农民协会者，按照农民协会组织通则第二章第四条之规定，经过乡农民大会或乡农民代表大会通过后，也可以成为农民协会会员。因为，土地改革既已完成，地主阶级既已消灭，富农加入农民协会对土地改革不利的情况已不必顾虑了，而那时农村的中心任务是组织农民生产，发展农业和副业，允许富农加入农会对农村生产是有利的。同时，经过土地改革锻炼的广大农民群众，政治觉悟水平也必然会有很大的增高，农民协会的组织也在土地改革斗争中加强了，提高了，到那时候，把富农吸收到农民协会中来，也就没有什么害处了。
    至于地主家庭出身的知识分子能否加入农民协会问题，在农民协会组织通则第二章第四条中规定：“凡被派到农村中从事农民运动的工作人员均得加入农民协会。”这里并未把地主家庭出身的知识分子除外。譬如华东、中南两区为今年秋后开始的土地改革运动所准备和训练的十八万干部，其中就有很大一批是地主家庭出身的知识分子。又如在过去老解放区的土地改革运动中，也有不少地主家庭出身的知识分子被派到农村中从事农民运动，他们不仅可以加入农民协会，而且有的还可以成为农民运动的干部，获得了农民群众的爱戴，因为他们在伟大的土地改革的烈火中锤炼了自己，改造了自己。这些业已背叛了地主阶级的，决心为人民服务的地主家庭出身的革命知识分子，是可以加入农民协会的，并且农民也不会计较他们的家庭出身，也一定会允许他们加入农民协会的。此外，还有一些地主家庭出身的知识分子，他们并没有从地主阶级分裂出来。作为改革土地制度的合法执行机关的农民协会，为实现土地改革而斗争的农民协会，当然就不能允许他们加入，他们也没有理由要求加入。难道实现土地改革的战斗组织的农民协会可以允许他们混进来窃取领导破坏土改吗？当然是不可以的。
    组织了农民协会，是否还需要组织贫农团呢？在华北、东北等老区，过去实行土地改革时，曾组织过贫农团，但是经验证明，贫农团的组织对于团结中农究竟是有妨碍的。所以刘少奇副主席在关于土地改革问题的报告中指出：在今后的土地改革运动中，不要再组织贫农团。但这是不是说，在今后的土地改革运动中不要依靠贫农和雇农了呢？不是的。贫农和雇农对改革土地制度的要求是最积极的，土地改革的工作仍然必须倚靠贫农和雇农。毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的讲话中这样指示我们，刘副主席在土地改革问题的报告中也这样指示我们。当然，倚靠贫农雇农必须与团结中农相结合，不应当过分地不适当地强调依靠贫农雇农而忽视团结中农。
    对于农民协会组织通则的全部内容，新解放区一切农村工作人员特别是准备参加土地改革的工作人员应当加以详细研究。凡尚未成立农民协会而准备进行土地改革的地方，都应当按正确的组织原则成立农民协会。凡已经成立农民协会而其组织成份和领导成份不很纯洁的地方，应当在目前农村各项工作的执行过程中，按照已公布的组织通则，使之逐步纯洁起来。农民协会应当清除那些混进到农民协会中来的、甚至混进到农民协会领导机关中来的地主富农分子及其代理人，而把农民协会的领导真正掌握在正派的劳苦农民——雇农贫农和中农手中，以便有力量地进入今年秋后即将开始的空前规模的土地改革，并真正做到有组织有秩序地顺利完成消灭地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制的历史任务。
