　　Notification from the Beijing Municipal People's Government
    Fu Mi Zi No. 2
    1. Regarding the location of factories with more than three horsepower electricity in this city, specific regulations were previously made, and the "Fu Jian Guan Zi No. 1" proclamation was followed on April 22, 1950. Now, in order to take care of objective needs and facilitate industrial development, supplementary regulations are made based on the current situation as follows:
    (A) For old factories (excluding explosive, malodorous, and flammable factories) established outside the designated areas before the promulgation of the "Fu Jian Guan Zi No. 1" proclamation, under the conditions of suitable environment and neighborhood consent, if the business scope (i.e., nature) is not changed, no factory buildings are added, and the original buildings are still usable, the following matters are allowed:
    (1) Increasing horsepower.
    (2) Relocating the address, but not allowing relocation from outside the city to inside the city, or from designated areas within the city to non-designated areas within the city.
    (3) Transferring or changing the name.
    (B) For newly opened factories that invested in installing machinery, electricity, and other equipment in various urban areas outside the designated areas before the promulgation of the "Fu Jian Guan Zi No. 1" proclamation (before April 22, 1950), if there is concrete proof and the consent of the neighbors has been obtained, it may be approved, but no further increase in horsepower will be allowed in the future.
    (C) For newly applied factories, if the Municipal Industry and Construction Bureaus deem the situation special and truly necessary, and the environment is suitable, and the neighbors agree, they may be opened in areas outside the provisions of the "Fu Jian Guan Zi No. 1" proclamation after being reported and approved by the Municipal Government.
    (D) All factories planning to be newly opened shall not proceed with investment and preparation matters before approval.
    2. This is a special notification, hoping that all public and private factories will abide by it.
                               July 19, 1950
                                           Mayor Nie Rongzhen
