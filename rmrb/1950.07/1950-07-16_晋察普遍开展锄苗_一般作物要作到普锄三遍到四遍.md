    Extensive Weeding Campaign Launched in Jin-Cha Area
    General Crops to be Weeded Three to Four Times
    [Report from this newspaper] According to reports from multiple correspondents: Shanxi and Chahar provinces are now entering a period of intense summer weeding. In Shanxi Province, with the exception of the colder areas in northern Shanxi, the weeding campaign has been widely launched in more than 80 counties. Several counties have already completed the first round of weeding and begun the second. According to statistics from late June, the counties of Mengxian, Wuxiang, Qingshui, Qixian, and Yangqu, including thirty districts and nine villages, have weeded more than 1.7 million mu. Due to the timely completion of sowing this spring, summer weeding is also proceeding on schedule. However, since the end of April, 47 counties across the province have suffered from hailstorms. After the sowing was completed in the affected areas, there was an urgent need for replanting and reseeding, resulting in staggered emergence of autumn seedlings, coinciding with the summer harvest, making farmers particularly busy.
    In Chahar Province, the counties in the Yanbei, Chanan, and Chabei regions are weeding autumn seedlings for the first time. Yanqing has weeded more than 270,000 mu of field crops; Xuanhua has weeded 850,000 mu; Wanquan has weeded 90 percent; Longguan has completed the first weeding of early-maturing crops; Huailai has completed the first weeding and half of the second; Shangdu has weeded more than 148,000 mu in fifty-seven villages.
    Many areas of Shanxi and Chahar provinces have suffered from disasters such as wind and hail. In Shanxi, in addition to damage to wheat fields, the cold weather has caused the soil to harden, affecting crop growth. Therefore, a widespread campaign to weed and cultivate seedlings more frequently is essential to reduce disaster losses and realize increased production. The Chahar Provincial Party Committee, in its instructions on summer weeding and surviving the famine, required that sorghum and corn be weeded four times, and barley, wheat, millet, broomcorn millet, and naked oats be weeded three times. The key to weeding is to organize and solve the labor shortage. Both provinces have universally developed work exchange and mutual assistance in weeding and mobilized large numbers of women to participate.

　　晋察普遍开展锄苗
    一般作物要作到普锄三遍到四遍
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报道：山西、察哈尔两省现正进入紧张夏锄阶段。山西全省除晋北较冷的地区外，其余八十多县，锄苗运动已普遍展开，若干县份业已锄完头遍，开始锄第二遍。据六月下旬，盂县、武乡、沁水、祁县、阳曲等四个整县、三十个区、九个村的统计，已锄苗一百七十余万亩。由于今春按时完成了播种，夏锄也能按时进行。但从四月底以后，全省有四十七县遭受雹灾；受灾地区播种完成之后，又紧急补种、改种，因之秋苗出土期不一，与夏收挤在一起，农民特别繁忙。
    察省雁北、察南、察北区各县正锄头遍秋苗。延庆已锄过大田作物二十七万多亩；宣化已锄苗八十五万亩；万全已锄百分之九十；龙关早熟作物都锄过了头遍；怀来头遍已锄完，二遍已锄一半；商都五十七个村已锄苗十四万八千余亩。
    山西、察哈尔两省不少地区曾遭受风雹等灾害。山西除麦田受损害外，秋田亦因气候转冷，地皮坚破，影响作物成长，因此普遍发动多锄培苗，减少灾害损失，是实现增产的重要关键。察省党委在夏锄、度荒指示中即要求高粱、玉茭应作到锄四遍，大麦、小麦、谷、黍、莜麦锄三遍。锄苗的关键在于组织起来，解决劳力困难。两省在锄苗中都普遍发展了拨工互助，并发动了广大妇女参加。（贾保金、张步高、赵绪、刘伏怀、贾富魁、马超俊、药维忠、志立、志铭）
