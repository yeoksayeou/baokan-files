　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Tokyo, TASS, 14th: The Japanese Communist Party recently published a leaflet in the form of a letter to the people, stating: "Our working people and patriotic people of our country! War has broken out in Korea, which is only separated from Japan by a strait. Japan, which should generally oppose war, is now actively participating in this war, serving as a military base and a supply base for military materials." The letter continued: "Our motherland has never faced such a fatal crisis. To avoid this crisis, we must not allow our country to participate directly or indirectly in the Korean civil war. ... The Japanese working people sympathize with North Korea. For the sake of world peace, we oppose any interference in the Korean civil war. This is the best way to end the Korean civil war as soon as possible. We strongly oppose our country's participation in the Korean civil war in any form. This is most important for our country's peace and security, and it is also most important for world peace. For the sake of our country's revival, we must maintain friendly relations with the Korean people and the people of other Asian countries.
    Japanese working people and patriotic people! Our rulers have openly trampled on the Potsdam Declaration and the Japanese Constitution. They are using the Korean civil war to try to delay the peace treaty, further colonize our country, turn our country into a military base, and restore a military fascist regime similar to the wartime regime. Domestic militarist forces and war industries are rapidly recovering. Communist Party leaders and the newspaper Akahata have been persecuted. All speeches and articles stating the truth about the war, and all statements opposing layoffs and demanding employment and wage increases, have been brutally suppressed by the police. In arms factories, workers are subjected to cruel exploitation and oppression by the capitalists, in addition to low wages. Farmers are suffering from forced grain deliveries, low rice prices, heavy taxes, and food imports. Peaceful industries and the original small and medium-sized enterprises are on the verge of disaster."
    The letter called on Japanese patriotic people to organize mass actions under the following slogans: No interference in the Korean civil war; No manufacturing and transporting weapons; Oppose war propaganda; Oppose turning Japan into a military base and colony; Immediately conclude a comprehensive peace treaty; Withdraw all occupation forces after the conclusion of the peace treaty; All peace-loving countries guarantee Japan's security; Defend the Constitution; Strive for freedom of speech, association, demonstration, and strike; Oppose the suppression of the Communist Party, which leads the anti-war movement; Overthrow the Yoshida fascist cabinet, which is trying to restore militarism; Ban atomic bombs and designate the government that first used atomic bombs as war criminals; Ally and cooperate with all peace-loving forces in the world.
    After urging the Japanese working people to actively participate in the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal, the letter stated: "Japanese working people and patriotic people! The Democratic National Front, advocated by our party, is an organization that struggles against war and fascism and strives for national independence. Join its ranks now. The road to victory is naturally full of difficulties. The reactionary forces and traitors are afraid of this front, and they will certainly strengthen their brutal suppression. Their lackeys - the Socialist Party traitors and splitters - will desperately weaken this front. However, no force can suppress the patriotism of the entire nation in opposing war, opposing fascism, and striving for national independence. ... Stand up under the banner of saving the country. Today, the decisive moment has arrived. Strike at the militarists and fascists to avoid a shameful death. Join the ranks of the Democratic National Front. Victory will belong to the people."

　　日共发表告日本人民书
    号召参加民主民族战线争取民族独立
    反对日本以任何方式参加朝鲜的内战
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社十四日电引东京消息：日本共产党顷发表告人民书的传单，内称：“我国的劳动人民，爱国志士们！战争已在和日本仅隔着一道海峡的朝鲜发生了。日本应该是一般反对战争的，现在却正在积极地参加这个战争，充作军事基地和军用物资供应基地。”该书继称：“我们的祖国以前从没有逢到这样致命危机的威胁。要避免这种危机，我们必须不让我们的国家直接地或间接地参加朝鲜的内战。……日本劳动人民是同情北朝鲜方面的。为了世界的和平，我们反对任何干涉朝鲜内战的行为。这是早日结束朝鲜内战的最好方法。我们强烈地反对我国以任何形式参加朝鲜的内战。这对我国的和平与安全是最重要不过的，对世界和平也是最重要不过的。为我国复兴的利益着想，我们必须和朝鲜人民以及其他亚洲国家的人民保持友好关系。
    日本的劳动人民和爱国志士们！我国的统治者们公然蹂躏了波茨坦宣言和日本宪法，他们利用朝鲜的内战力图拖延媾和，使我国进一步殖民地化，把我国变成军事基地，同时恢复和战时政权相似的军事法西斯政权。国内军国主义势力和战争工业正在迅速恢复。共产党的领袖及报纸赤旗报已遭到迫害。所有陈述战争实情的演说和文章，所有反对裁员要求就业和增加工资的言论，都受到警察的残酷的镇压。在军火工厂里，工人们除了工资低微外，还受到资方残酷的剥削和压迫。农民苦于强迫交粮、米价低贱、重税和粮食入口。和平工业和原先的中小企业已到了灾难的边缘。”
    该书号召日本爱国志士们在下列口号下组织群众的行动：不准干涉朝鲜内战；不制造和运输武器；反对贩卖战争的宣传；反对把日本变为军事基地和殖民地；立即签订全面和约；和约缔结后撤退一切占领军；全世界爱好和平的国家保障日本的安全；保卫宪法；争取言论、结社、示威和罢工的自由；反对镇压领导反对战争运动的共产党；打倒企图恢复军国主义的吉田法西斯内阁；禁止原子弹并定第一个使用原子弹的政府为战犯；与全世界爱好和平的力量同盟和合作。
    该书在敦促日本劳动人民积极参加为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动之后称：“日本劳动人民和爱国志士们！我党主张成立的民主民族战线，乃是为反对战争和法西斯主义，争取民族独立而斗争的组织。现在就参加它的队伍吧。走向胜利的道路自然是困难多端的。反动势力及卖国贼是害怕这个战线的，他们一定会加强残暴的镇压，他们的走狗——社会党叛徒和分裂分子一定会拚命削弱这个战线。但是，没有任何力量能够镇压全民族的反对战争、反对法西斯主义、争取民族独立的爱国主义。……在挽救国家的旗帜下站起来。今天，决定性的时刻已经到来。打击军国主义分子和法西斯分子，以避免可耻的死亡。参加民主民族战线的队伍。胜利将属于人民。”
