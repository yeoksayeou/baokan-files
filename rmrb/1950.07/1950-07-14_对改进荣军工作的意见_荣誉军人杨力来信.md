　　Opinions on Improving the Work of Honored Servicemen
　　Letter from Honored Serviceman Yang Li

　　Comrade Editor:
　　I am an honored serviceman and also a staff member of the Second Honored Servicemen's School in Hebei Province. The honored servicemen in our school have many opinions on the work of honored servicemen, and I am writing them down below:

　　First, let's talk about work. It seems that honored servicemen have only two paths after leaving the hospital: one is to retire, and the other is to enter a school for honored servicemen. However, the vast majority of honored servicemen are unwilling to retire, especially the cadres and veteran soldiers. According to my personal understanding, some honored servicemen are capable of being assigned certain jobs. The main reason why they are not assigned jobs is that the leading organs in charge of honored servicemen (the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government) do not understand the honored servicemen well enough. They think that honored servicemen have lost their ability to work due to their disabilities. Secondly, they believe that honored servicemen all have ideological problems and must be educated in schools for honored servicemen for a long time. But what is the actual situation of the honored servicemen? Some of them are able to work and can be assigned jobs immediately. It is true that some have bad ideological styles, such as cursing, complaining, and even engaging in illegal activities. However, from the leadership's point of view, it should be checked whether they have been cared for enough. If this is resolved from both sides, the problem will be easily solved. I believe that as long as we vigorously strengthen education for them, they will become the backbone of various jobs.

　　Of course, the establishment of schools for honored servicemen is to educate honored servicemen and improve their ideological and working abilities. However, there are indeed too many things that need to be improved in the schools for honored servicemen. For example, the curriculum only has two classes, senior elementary and junior elementary, and the courses are only Chinese, arithmetic, politics, and general knowledge, and the proportion of the courses is 50% for both cultural and political classes. Some soldiers with lower education levels do not feel too dissatisfied with their studies; but some cadres and honored servicemen with higher education levels (such as junior high school and senior high school levels) express great disinterest in learning. They say, "If you don't assign us jobs, would you please assign us to accelerated middle schools, or Party schools, or construction colleges?" But the reply from the higher authorities is: "Those who are not on-the-job cadres cannot be assigned to study there." Is this statement correct? We think it is incorrect.

　　Comrade Editor: I hope to have our opinions published to attract the attention and research of relevant parties.

### 对改进荣军工作的意见  荣誉军人杨力来信

　　对改进荣军工作的意见
    荣誉军人杨力来信编辑同志：
    我是一个荣誉军人，也是河北省第二荣校的一个工作人员。我校的荣誉军人对荣誉军人工作有很多意见，现在把它写在下面：
    先谈工作问题。荣誉军人出了医院好像只有两条道路：一是退伍，一是进荣誉军人学校。可是极大多数的荣誉军人是不愿意退伍的，特别是干部及老战士们。据我个人了解，有一部分荣誉军人是可以分配他们一定的工作的。所以不被分配工作的主要原因，是主管荣军的领导机关（省府民政厅）对荣誉军人了解不足，他们以为荣誉军人残废了便已失去工作条件。其次他们认为荣誉军人思想上都有毛病，必须长期在荣誉军人学校受教育。可是荣誉军人的实际情况怎样呢？他们有些是能够工作，是可以马上分配工作的。也确有些思想作风不好的，如骂街、发牢骚，甚至有非法的事情。但从领导上来说，应检查对他们关心够不够。这样由两方面来解决，问题就容易得到解决。我认为只要对他们大力加强教育，就会使他们变成各种工作中的骨干。
    当然，荣誉军人学校的设立，就是为了教育荣誉军人，提高荣誉军人的思想及工作能力的。但荣誉军人学校确实应当改进之处太多了。如编制只有高小和初小两个班，课程只是国文、算术、政治、常识四门，而且课程的比重都是文化课和政治课各占百分之五十。有些文化程度较低的战士，在学习上还不感到怎样不满；但一些干部及文化程度较高的（如初中、高中程度）荣誉军人则对学习表示非常不感兴趣。他们说：“不分配我们工作，请把我们分配到速成中学，或党校、建设学院去行吗？”可是上级的答复是：“不是在职干部，不能分配到那里去学习。”这个说法对吗？我们认为是不对的。
    编辑同志：希望把我们的意见发表出来，以引起有关方面的研究和注意。
                           河北省第二荣誉军人学校  杨力
