Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily, several private rubber factories in Shanghai that accepted orders from state-owned enterprises and the People's Liberation Army have failed to strictly fulfill their contracts, either by delaying delivery or by producing substandard products. Delayed delivery is a fairly common phenomenon among the private rubber factories that accepted orders. For example, Zhengtai Rubber Factory was contracted to make 20,000 dozen pairs of rubber shoes for the Third Field Army, which, according to the original contract, should have been delivered in full by March 20th. However, the factory did not deliver the first batch of finished products until mid-April. The Dachina and Zhengtai factories were contracted to make 47,000 dozen pairs of rubber shoes for the First Field Army, which were originally scheduled to be delivered by June 5th, but as of the 12th, 24 percent had not yet been delivered. Secondly, inferior products are used to make up the numbers. For example, in the first batch of goods delivered by Dachina Rubber Factory, 14 percent of the rubber shoes were returned due to "rand" (sole edge) delamination. In the first batch of rubber shoes delivered by Zhengtai Factory, 20 percent were delaminated, 10 percent in the second batch, and 5 percent still in the third batch, resulting in three consecutive returns. According to the contract signed between the Third Field Army and Jingang Rubber Factory, the rubber content of the rubber shoe soles should not be less than 55 percent, but the rubber content of the soles made by Jingang Rubber Factory was only 38.5 percent, so they were also returned.

The main reasons for these phenomena are: First, the factories accept orders without considering their actual production capacity. At the same time, when state-owned enterprises and the People's Liberation Army place orders with private rubber factories, they do not have a sufficient understanding of the situation of each factory, and they have not allocated orders according to the production capacity of each factory. For example, Zhengtai Rubber Factory received orders for 34,000 dozen pairs of shoes in April, which exceeded the factory's production capacity, so it had to distribute 9,000 dozen pairs to other factories. Therefore, some factories could not deliver the goods on time because the orders they accepted exceeded their production capacity. Second, some manufacturers are not honest and consciously use fewer materials, resulting in their own losses after being returned. Third, the factory management is poor, and the trade union has also failed to focus on production, resulting in lax labor discipline. For example, the workers in the Zhengtai workshop who roll shoe materials tried to roll the materials quickly, resulting in the bottom materials being too hard. The workers who cut the bottom saw that the bottom material was too hard to cut, so they increased the heat of the electric knife, resulting in the edges of the soles being too cooked and lacking viscosity, which caused the rand to delaminate from the soles. The workers who inspect and package the shoes also do not inspect carefully. Therefore, the factory was returned three times in a row.

Currently, among the 103 rubber factories in Shanghai, more than 70 are in operation (including those that operate intermittently), and more than half of them are operating due to government orders and the purchase of finished products.

### 上海若干私营橡胶厂  承制定货违反合同规定迟交定货成品不合规格

　　上海若干私营橡胶厂
    承制定货违反合同规定迟交定货成品不合规格
    【新华社二十七日讯】据上海解放日报载：接受国营企业和人民解放军定货的若干上海私营橡胶工厂，未能严格履行合同，或迟交定货，或所制的成品不合规定的标准。迟交定货在各接受定货的私营橡胶厂中是相当普遍的现象。如正泰橡胶厂为第三野战军定做的两万打胶鞋，按照原订合同规定，应于三月二十日全部交清，但该厂迟至四月中才交出了第一批成品。大中华、正泰两厂为第一野战军定做的四万七千打胶鞋，原规定六月五日交齐，但到十二日止，还有百分之二十四未交。其次是以次货充数。如大中华橡胶厂第一批交货中，有百分之十四的胶鞋因“沿条”脱胶而被退货。正泰厂交的第一批胶鞋中，脱胶的占百分之二十，第二批占百分之十，第三批仍有百分之五，因之被连续退货三次。按照第三野战军与金刚橡胶厂订定的合同，规定胶鞋大底的含胶量不得低于百分之五十五，但金刚橡胶厂所作大底含胶量仅百分之三十八点五，因此亦被退货。
    发生这些现象的主要原因是：一、厂方不根据实际生产能力而抢接定货。同时，国营企业和解放军向私营橡胶厂定货时，由于对各厂情况了解不够，也没有做到按照各厂的生产能力来分配定货。如正泰橡胶厂四月间接到定货三万四千打，就超过了该厂的生产能力，结果不得不把其中九千打分给其他工厂去作。因此，有的工厂因所接受的定货超过了自己的生产能力，以致到了限期而交不出货品。二、某些厂家态度不老实，有意识地少用材料，结果被退货后反而造成自己的损失。三、工厂管理不善，工会亦未能面向生产，以致劳动纪律松懈。如正泰大车间轧鞋料的工人，为求快轧，结果使底料太硬。而划底部工人见底料太硬不易划，就把电刀热度提高，结果鞋底边沿烫得太熟，缺乏黏性，就造成毛沿条与鞋底脱胶的现象。检查与包装的工人也不仔细检查。因此该厂即被连续退货三次。
    按目前上海市一百零三个橡胶工厂中，开工的有七十多家（包括间歇开工的在内），因政府定货及收购成品而开工的占半数以上。
