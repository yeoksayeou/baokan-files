　　The Direction of the Wool Textile Industry
　　Yu Liting
　　Among the textile industries, the wool textile industry faces the most difficulties. On the one hand, there is a shortage of raw materials, and on the other hand, the market is unusually narrow.

　　The so-called shortage of raw materials mainly refers to those factories that have always needed to import wool tops from foreign countries. Except for the wool textile factories in wool-producing areas and the very few wool textile factories during the Anti-Japanese War that had to use domestic wool, most of our wool textile factories did not use domestic wool. This is a manifestation of the semi-colonial nature of the industry. After the Japanese surrender, entrepreneurs who used domestic wool had to succumb to the threat of foreign wool. The vast majority of those engaged in the wool textile industry believed that Chinese wool was not suitable for spinning and needed to be improved. However, under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the work of improving wool breeds was never taken seriously. At that time, the price of domestic wool plummeted, and the lives of herders were difficult. In the early days of liberation, the price of Northwest wool was only 900 yuan per catty in Renminbi. This shows that domestic wool was not well utilized in the past, causing significant losses to the herders. Our wool textile industry truly began to value the use of domestic wool after the liberation of Shanghai last year and the blockade of ports by the American Chiang Kai-shek forces. Foreign wool tops could not be imported, so a wool inspection team was organized, and the joint purchase of domestic wool was initially trialed. For the wool textile industry, this was a major turning point. However, it should also be pointed out that only a portion of people were truly concerned about this work and determined to do it well. Among our entrepreneurs, there are still many concerns, and they still hope to use foreign raw materials.

　　This is not surprising. Everyone knows that China's cotton textile industry had a very short period when raw materials were barely self-sufficient. However, the wool textile industry has always used Australian wool, or even semi-finished products – wool tops – from foreign wool textile factories. A large portion of the worsted spinning equipment can only process wool tops. The wool textile industry is such an incomplete industry. Even if our wool could be self-sufficient, a large portion of our wool textile industry would not be able to directly utilize raw wool. According to the currently operating figures, domestic wool is barely sufficient. However, there are only about thirty circular combing machines in the country, which can only produce part of the wool tops. This means that the remaining wool cannot be handled by the existing wool textile equipment. Therefore, today's so-called raw material problem is not the lack of raw wool, but the lack of semi-finished products.

　　This illustrates a problem: our Chinese wool textile industry is an industry with a stronger semi-colonial nature than the cotton textile industry. Unless this is transformed, the "raw material problem" of the Chinese wool textile industry will never be solved.

　　Let's talk about the market problem. In the past, fine goods outnumbered coarse goods in finished products, and worsted spinning equipment outnumbered woolen spinning equipment. As for sales, there were some, but the target of the wool textile industry in the past was not the working masses or urban petty bourgeoisie. It was only the bureaucrats, compradors, landlords, speculators, and some petty officials who had to wear wool textiles for their livelihoods. After liberation, the bureaucrats fled, the lives of the compradors and landlords declined. Speculators have been unable to speculate or have very little chance of speculating, and very few staff members of the People's Government wear wool textiles. The wool textile industry lost its consumer base. As a result, sales were greatly affected. Moreover, precisely because of the situation before liberation where the more expensive, the better, people regarded wool fabrics as noble items. This also illustrates a problem: the wool textile industry in the past mainly served bureaucratic capitalism, feudalism, and speculators, not the people. Without fundamentally transforming this, our wool textile industry has no future.

　　Changing the semi-colonial wool textile industry into a people's wool textile industry should become our basic task. Then, the difficulties our wool textile industry faces today are not any other difficulties, but the difficulties in the process of transformation.

　　The joint purchase of domestic wool by public and private wool textile factories has been decided, which is a good start. Only when our wool textile industry generally recognizes and truly begins to practically utilize domestic wool, and only when the wool textile industry truly utilizes domestic wool, can the work of improving wool breeds play a practical role. The Central Ministry of Agriculture has already transported 250 heads of fine wool breeds this year, and must continue to do so next year. It is estimated that in five years, the number of improved wool breeds nationwide will reach 4.37 million. Its wool production can offset half of the total amount of wool produced by domestic sheep. At the same time, with the large-scale breeding of domestic sheep, the raw wool problem can be solved.

　　Of course, having wool alone cannot solve the problem. We must also solve the problems of circular combing machines, wool washing plants, and packing plants. The government has decided that, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately owned, wool washing plants and packing plants must be established in wool-producing areas, and circular combing machines must be added, to manufacture wool tops and overcome the disconnection in the wool textile industry. Before domestic equipment is sufficient to completely solve the need for wool tops, in order to maintain the production of some manufacturers, special permission for the import of foreign wool tops can be considered. On the other hand, it is also considered that if the finished products produced from these foreign wool tops are still allowed to be transported and sold domestically, it will inevitably affect the utilization of domestic wool. Therefore, in addition to industrial fabrics, their products must be exported. The government should consider using all means to encourage them in this regard.

　　The raw material problem should be solved through the above three methods. However, if our finished products are still the same old thing, the market will still be unusually narrow, and the wool textile industry will still have no way out. Where can we open up a way out? Can promotion open up a way out? For example, everyone can promote the advantages of wool textiles, explaining that wool textiles are durable and cheaper than cotton cloth. However, consumers first consider the issue of purchasing power. After the long-term rule of the Kuomintang and decades of inflation, the purchasing power of the Chinese people has been greatly weakened. The wool textile industry is different from the cotton textile industry. Cotton textiles are necessary for everyone. As long as the people's living standards improve slightly, the market can expand accordingly. However, wool fabrics and other textiles cannot penetrate the countryside for the time being. These are all factual issues, which cannot be completely solved by promotion. Therefore, the wool textile industry today can only be maintained as much as possible. The fine goods manufactured by the worsted spinning sector should strive to be exported as much as possible. The woolen spinning sector must reduce costs and take mass-market or industrial fabrics as the production direction to meet current needs. Otherwise, our market will be difficult to expand. If someone thinks that spindles are cheap and plans to expand, the result will inevitably be a phenomenon of starting and stopping production at the same time, which is wrong.

　　Does the wool textile industry have a future? The answer is yes. Because the purchasing power of our people will gradually increase as the country's financial situation gradually improves. The national economy is interconnected. The vitality of the rural economy will bring about the vitality of the urban economy. The increase in rural purchasing power will bring about the increase in urban purchasing power. The wool textile industry will also gradually recover as the entire national financial situation gradually improves. On the other hand, only when the wool textile industry is maintained, recovered, and developed, can the lives of herders gradually improve. The wool textile industry has a future. Today, we should face reality, those who can maintain should maintain, those who can transform should transform, transform our enterprises, and overcome difficulties together.

### 毛纺织工业的方向

　　毛纺织工业的方向
    俞鲤庭
    在纺织工业中，毛纺织工业是比较困难最多的一个。一方面是原料缺乏，另方面是市场异常狭窄。
    所谓缺乏原料，基本上是指那些一向需要从外国进口毛条的工厂而言。我们的毛纺织业除了产毛区的毛纺织厂，以及抗战时期极少数毛纺织厂不得不利用国毛之外，极大部分毛纺织工厂是不利用国毛的，这是工业半殖民地性的表现。日本投降之后，利用国毛的企业家，又不能不屈服于外毛的威胁之下。绝大多数从事毛纺织工业者认为：中国的羊毛不适于纺织之用，需要改良。但在帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义的统治下改良羊种的工作又从未被认真做过。当时国毛价格惨跌，牧民生活困苦。解放之初，西北毛价每斤只值人民币九百元。这说明了过去没有好好利用国毛，致牧民遭受重大的损失。我们的毛纺织工业真正重视国毛的利用，是在去年上海解放，美蒋封锁港口之后。外国毛条没法进口了，于是组织了羊毛考察团，并且初步试行了国毛联购。对毛纺织工业而言，这是很大的转机。但也应当指出：确实关心这件工作和决心来做好这件工作的，还只是限于一部分人。在我们的企业家中间，依然存在着许多顾虑，依然希望利用国外原料。
    这也是不足为怪的。人人知道，中国的棉纺织工业还有过一个很短的时期，原料曾差堪自给。而毛纺织工业却是从来都是利用澳洲羊毛，甚至是外国毛纺工厂中的半制品——毛条。很大一部分的精纺设备，只能将毛条进行加工。毛纺织工业就是这样不健全的工业。纵使我们的羊毛能够自给自足，而我们的毛纺织工业却有极大部分不能直接利用原毛。按照目前实开工的数字，本国的羊毛是勉强够用的。但是全国仅约三十台圆梳机，只能制造部分的毛条。这就是说，其余的羊毛，按目前仅有的毛纺设备是没法对付的。因此，今天所谓原料问题，不是原毛缺乏，而是半制品的缺乏。
    这里说明了一个问题，我们中国毛纺织工业是一个比较棉纺织工业带着更浓厚的半殖民地性的工业。不将这一点加以改造，中国毛纺织工业的“原料问题”，将始终不得解决。
    再说市场问题。过去的成品是细货多于粗货，设备是精纺多于粗纺。而销路呢，倒反而有一些的，过去毛纺织工业的对象，不是工农大众也不是城市小市民。只是官僚、买办、地主、投机分子、以及一部分为了饭碗不得不穿毛织品的小公务员。解放之后，官僚逃跑了，买办、地主们的生活下降了。投机分子则已无法投机或很少投机可能了，而人民政府的工作人员穿毛织品的很少。毛纺织工业失去了消费的对象。于是销路大受影响。而且正是由于解放以前的那种愈贵愈好的情况，遂使人们都以呢绒为高贵品。这里也说明了一个问题：毛纺织工业过去基本上是为官僚主义、封建主义、投机分子而服务的，不是为人民大众而服务的。不根本改造这一点，我们的毛纺织工业是没有前途的。
    改变半殖民地性的毛纺织工业为人民的毛纺织工业，应当成为我们的基本任务。那末我们毛纺织工业今天的困难不是任何别的困难，而是改造过程中的困难。
    公私毛纺织工厂，已决定联购国毛，这是一个很好的开始。只有当我们毛纺织工业普遍认识到和真正开始实际利用国产羊毛的时候，也只有当毛纺织工业真正利用国毛的时候，改良羊种的工作，才能起实际的作用。中央农业部今年已运入优良羊种二百五十头，明年还须这样做，估计五年之后，全国改良羊种将达四百三十七万头。其产毛量可抵目前本国绵羊所产羊毛总量的二分之一。同时加上本国绵羊的大量繁殖，原毛的问题将可因之而解决。
    单有羊毛当然仍不能解决问题，还必须解决圆梳机、洗毛厂、打包厂等问题。政府已决定，无论公营私营，都得在产毛地区设立洗毛厂、打包厂、添置圆梳机，以便制造毛条，克服毛纺织工业中的脱节现象。在本国设备还不足以全部解决毛条的需要之前，为了维持一部分厂家的生产，可以考虑外国毛条特许进口。另一方面也考虑到假如准许这些外国毛条生产出来的成品，依然在国内运销，则必然影响国毛的利用，因此其制品除了工业用呢之外，必须出口。政府在这方面应考虑用一切办法鼓励他们。
    原料问题通过以上三种办法，应该是可以解决的了。但假如我们的成品依然是老一套，市场将仍然异常狭窄，毛纺织工业还是没有出路的。从什么地方打开出路呢？提倡一下，能够打开出路吗？比如大家都来宣传毛织品的优点，说明毛织品的经久耐用，要比棉布便宜。但是消费者首先估量的却是购买力的问题。中国人民经过国民党的长期统治，十几年的通货膨胀，购买力大为削弱了。毛纺织工业不同于棉纺织工业。棉织品为人人所必需，只要人民的生活水平稍稍提高，市场就可随之扩大，而呢绒等织物，一时还不能深入农村。这些都是事实问题。不是提倡所能完全解决。因此，毛纺织工业在今天只能尽可能的维持，精纺部分制造的细货应尽可能争取出口。粗纺部分则必须减低成本，以大众化或工业用呢为生产方针，以适应当前的需要。不如此我们的市场也是难以扩大的。如果有人以为锭子便宜，打算扩充，其结果必然造成一面开工，一面停工的现象，这是错误的。
    毛纺织工业是否有前途呢？答复是肯定的。因为我们全国人民的购买力将因国家财经状况的逐步好转而逐步提高，国民经济是具有联系性的。农村经济的活泼将带来城市经济的活泼，农村购买力的提高将带来城市购买力的提高，毛纺织工业也将随着整个国家财经状况逐步好转而逐步恢复。另一方面，也只有毛纺织工业由维持而恢复而发展，牧民的生活也才能逐步的改善。毛纺织工业是有前途的，今天则应当面对现实，可能维持者维持，能转向者转向，改造我们的企业，共同度过困难。
