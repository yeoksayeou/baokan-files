　　Zheng Jide, the Heroine of Lishui
　　——Story No. 4 from the Guerrilla Zone in Southern Korea
　　The 14th Regiment of the puppet National Defense Forces stationed in Lishui refused to go to Jeju Island to massacre the people's armed forces, and at 2:00 AM on October 21, 1948, they announced their uprising. Immediately, the people of Lishui City cheered the uprising troops with "Hurrah!" like a flood. Lishui City became the people's.
　　By the morning of the 21st, the uprising troops had controlled Suncheon (northwest of Lishui). The citizens of Lishui, with workers and young students as the backbone, organized a "Citizens' Force" to be responsible for local security. Among this citizens' force, the most notable was Zheng Jide, an 18-year-old female worker. She only had her mother at home, and because of poverty, she went to work in a silk factory before finishing elementary school. Precisely because she suffered the cruel oppression of the reactionaries, her hatred for the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique was also the deepest. In every workers' struggle in the factory, she stood at the forefront.
　　After the Lishui uprising, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang hastily dispatched several regiments fully equipped with American weapons on the 23rd to fiercely attack the uprising army. Zheng Jide's unit was ordered to go to the Licun District for defensive battles. A heavy burden fell on the shoulders of the "Citizens' Force". The enemy's offensive firepower was fierce. Zheng Jide shouted on the front line: "Comrades! What is there to be afraid of! Can the people's Lishui, which patriots exchanged for with their blood, be taken away by wolves again? Now is the time for us to dedicate our blood and lives to fight for the people and the motherland!" Encouraged by Zheng Jide, the troops fought even more bravely.
　　This "Citizens' Force" had only two light machine guns besides rifles. They bravely defended their land, without retreating a single step. However, the ammunition was about to run out. And the headquarters storing the ammunition was on a high ground more than 1,000 meters away from the position. The enemy's firepower was controlling the road to the high ground. Zheng Jide volunteered, saying, "I'll go!" Immediately, she ran through the enemy bullets flying like rain to the headquarters, and then carried a lot of bullets back. But unfortunately, just as she ran to the light machine gun, an enemy bullet pierced her chest. She fell down, and the heroic Zheng Jide lay in a pool of blood. Inspired by her heroic deeds, the "Citizens' Force" continued to bravely defend their land.
　　On the 24th, the people of Lishui City held a funeral for Zheng Jide with grief. At the funeral, Zheng Jide's mother sadly expressed to everyone: "My child sacrificed herself for the motherland and the people. She died in a difficult life, and I only feel honored, I have no tears!"
　　Zheng Jide, this heroic name, will forever live in the hearts of the people of Lishui! (Translated by Jian from Pyongyang "Youth Life" May 1950 issue)

　　丽水的女英雄郑吉德
    ——朝鲜南部游击区故事之四
    驻在丽水的伪国防军第十四团，拒绝去济州岛屠杀人民武装，并在一九四八年十月二十一日早晨二时，宣布了起义。立刻，丽水城人民，像洪水似的用“万岁！”欢呼着起义部队。丽水市成了人民的了。
    二十一日晨，起义部队已控制了顺天（在丽水西北）。丽水的市民们，以工人、青年学生为骨干组织了“市民部队”，负责当地治安。在这一支市民部队中，最为人注目的是一个十八岁的女工郑吉德。她，家里只有母亲一人，因为贫穷，小学未读完就到一家丝织工厂中作工。正由于她受着反动派的残酷的压迫，所以她对于卖国贼李承晚集团痛恨的也最深刻。历次工厂的工人斗争，她都站在最前列。
    丽水起义后，李承晚匪帮仓惶地于二十三日调来几个全付美式装备的兵团，向起义军猛烈进攻。郑吉德参加的部队，奉令开到栗村区作防卫战。沉重的担子落在“市民部队”的双肩。敌人进攻的火力是猛烈的。郑吉德在火线上高喊着：“同志们！有什么可怕呀！爱国者用鲜血换来的人民的丽水，能再为狼群夺去吗？现在正是我们献出鲜血与生命为人民为祖国斗争的时候了！”由于郑吉德的鼓励，部队作战更勇敢了。
    这一支“市民部队”除步枪外，只有两挺轻机枪。他们英勇地防卫着自己的土地，一步也不后退。但是，弹药马上要用完了。而贮存弹药的指挥部却在距阵地一千多公尺的高地上。敌人的火力正控制着通往高地的道路。郑吉德自告奋勇，她说：“我去！”立刻，她就穿过像下雨似的飞来的敌弹跑到了指挥部，而且抱着很多子弹又跑回来。但是不幸的很，她刚刚跑到轻机枪的跟前，一颗敌弹贯穿了她的胸膛。她栽倒了，英雄的郑吉德躺在血泊中。“市民部队”为她的英雄事迹所鼓舞，继续勇敢地防卫着自己的土地。
    二十四日，丽水市人民带着悲痛的心情为郑吉德举行了葬礼。在葬礼上，郑吉德的母亲沉痛地向大家表示：“我的孩子为了祖国与人民而牺牲了。她死在艰难的生活中，我只觉得光荣，我没有眼泪！”
    郑吉德，这个英雄的名字，将永存在丽水人民的心里！（建译自平壤《青年生活》一九五○年五月号）
