　　Private Banks and Money Shops Slow to Improve Due to Lack of Real Change in Business Policy

　　[Our Newspaper] Reporter Jin Yu reports: Private banks and money shops in Beijing are experiencing slow business development due to the lack of real change in business policy and delayed internal reforms. Especially for the money shops, there are more difficulties because credit has not returned to normal.

　　Like their counterparts in other regions, Beijing's money shops have encountered serious difficulties in the overall social and economic transformation. From the beginning of February to the beginning of June this year, 27 shops successively closed down due to business losses and tight cash flow, accounting for more than half of all money shops.

　　Although the business of money shops entered a stable state in mid-May, the losses have not changed. The main reason is the lack of real change in business policy and the delay in internal organizational reforms. Of the 27 private money shops in the city, in terms of business policy, only some have joined the joint loan syndicate, with a portion of their funds invested in production enterprises. However, because the loan syndicate cannot actively develop business (only 470 million yuan has been loaned out of the syndicate's 3 billion yuan), the achievements of these money shops in connecting with production through the syndicate are very small. Some money shops even use their funds to transfer money to other places through interbank lending or invest in the securities market.

　　In terms of internal reforms, they have not yet begun. Except for banks like Continental, Jin Cheng, Salt Industry, and Guohua, which have reduced employee salaries through labor consultation, the phenomenon of bloated and huge institutions, numerous redundant staff, and huge expenses is still widespread. Therefore, if private money shops do not change their business policies and improve their internal conditions, they will inevitably face many difficulties and be unable to turn losses into profits.

### 没有切实转变业务方针  私营银钱业好转迟缓

　　没有切实转变业务方针
　  私营银钱业好转迟缓
    【本报讯】记者近宇报道：北京市私营银钱业，由于没有切实转变业务方针，又迁延内部改革，因而业务开展缓慢。特别是钱庄方面，由于信用没有恢复正常，还存在着更多的困难。
    京市行庄在整个社会经济转变中，和其他地区的同业一样，遭到严重的困难。自今年二月开始到六月上旬因业务亏累、资金周转不灵等原因有二十七家相继停业，占全部行庄的半数以上。
    五月中，行庄业务虽已进入稳定状态，但亏损尚未改变，主要原因乃是没有切实转变业务方针，而且迁延内部组织的改革。全市二十七家私营行庄，在业务方针方面，目前仅是参加了联合贷款银团，有部分资金投向生产事业。但由于贷款银团不能主动开展业务（该团三十亿资金仅能贷出四亿七千余万元），所以这些行庄通过银团而结合生产的成绩也就很小，甚至有些行庄却将资金用于联行调至他埠，或投向证券市场。
    在内部改革方面，则至今尚未着手进行。除大陆、金城、盐业、国华等行从劳动协商减少员工薪金外，机构臃肿庞大，冗员众多，开支浩繁的现象仍普遍存在着。因之私营行庄如不改变营业方针、改善内部情况，则必致困难重重，无法由亏转盈。
