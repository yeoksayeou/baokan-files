Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The National Customs Business Conference convened by the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government on the 19th of last month, lasting for 28 days, concluded successfully today. The main task of the conference was to discuss and revise the draft Customs Law of the People's Republic of China, prepared by the General Administration of Customs, based on the overall guidelines and policies of the Central People's Government on customs work and foreign trade work, and the spirit of the State Council's "Decision on Tariff Policy and Customs Work." The conference also discussed the principles for establishing customs nationwide, the locations for customs posts, personnel regulations for the organization and staffing of customs at all levels, and issues related to the customs flag and emblem.

In the nearly 100-year history of the old Chinese customs since its establishment, it had always been operating according to the orders and instructions of imperialism and its agents (foreign Inspector Generals of Customs) and individual administrative regulations of government agencies. Orders from the Chinese government were not implemented by customs unless they passed through the Inspectorate General of Customs. Although the customs was nominally under the leadership of the Chinese government, it was, in fact, solely controlled by the Inspector General. Therefore, the old China never had and could not have a real basic customs law.

This conference discussed in detail the new directions and new tasks of the new China's customs, with particular emphasis on the three main tasks of supervising import and export cargo, collecting tariffs, and cracking down on smuggling, as well as the organization and functions of customs. Based on the principle of "independence and self-reliance, centralized and unified leadership," the conference made clear provisions on the above points to protect national production and protect our country from the economic aggression of capitalist countries. In terms of organizational structure, the conference stipulated that local customs offices are to be uniformly led by the General Administration of Customs, and the organizational form of each customs office will also be unified by the General Administration. In terms of the scope of authority, the conference corrected the abnormal phenomenon of the old customs encompassing everything, resembling an "independent kingdom," and relieved it of all affairs not directly related to customs, so that customs and relevant departments could have a reasonable division of labor and close cooperation. In addition, the principles and locations for establishing customs are entirely based on the needs of national economic development and import and export trade, no longer establishing customs posts everywhere based on the needs of imperialism as in the past. Under the principle of complete independence and self-reliance, the Customs of the People's Republic of China has completely broken free from the control of imperialism and will formulate China's customs law for the first time.

The conference heard a report by Bo Yibo, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, on "The Current Domestic and International Situation and Financial and Economic Work," and a report by Ye Lizhuang, Minister of Trade, on "China's Foreign Trade Policy and its Relationship with Customs Work." The conference concluded with a summary report by Director Kong Yuan. Director Kong emphasized the great significance of the Common Program and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "May Day" report on the new China's customs policy for customs work. He said: Today, the Chinese people have taken the keys to their own door into their own hands, and the old customs controlled by imperialism has perished along with the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. Director Kong pointed out that this conference has solved many central issues in customs reform and construction, and that all new and old customs cadres must unite to complete the historical transformation of customs and to build the new customs of the People's Republic of China. Director Kong especially encouraged everyone to earnestly abide by the provisions of Article 18 of the Common Program, to practice a clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style, to severely punish corruption, to prohibit waste, and to oppose the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses.

　　全国海关业务会议圆满闭幕
    海关法草案已经讨论修正
    设关原则为保护国家生产不受资本主义国家侵略
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府海关总署于上月十九日召开的全国海关业务会议，历时二十八日，已于今日圆满闭幕。会议的主要工作是根据中央人民政府关于海关工作和对外贸易工作的总的方针政策和政务院“关于关税政策和海关工作的决定”的精神，讨论和修正了海关总署所拟定的中华人民共和国海关法草案。会议并讨论了全国设关原则、设关地点和各关组织编制等人事条例和海关关旗、关徽问题。
    旧中国海关自成立以后的近百年历史中，一向是按照帝国主义和它的代理人（外籍总税务司）的通令、指示和政府机关个别的单行规章办事的，中国政府的命令如非经过总税务司署，各关都不奉行。海关虽在名义上是受中国政府领导，事实上是由总税务司独揽大权。因此，旧中国从来没有也不可能有真正的海关基本法。
    此次会议详细地讨论了新中国海关的新方针和新任务，特别着重地讨论了进出口货运监管、征收关税、查禁走私三个主要任务及海关的组织、职权等问题。会议根据“独立自主，集中统一”的原则对上述各点作了明确的规定，以保护国家生产，保护我国不受资本主义国家的经济侵略。在组织机构上会议规定各地方海关由总署统一领导，各关的组织形式亦由总署加以统一。在职权范围上，会议纠正了旧海关包揽一切，俨然“独立王国”的不正常现象，解除一切和海关无直接关系的事务，使海关与各有关部门有合理的分工和密切的配合。此外，关于设关原则和地点，都完全是根据本国经济发展和出进口贸易需要而决定，不再如过去视帝国主义的需要而遍设关卡。在完全独立自主的原则下，中华人民共和国海关已完全摆脱帝国主义的控制，并将首次制定我国的海关法。
    会议曾听取政务院财政经济委员会薄一波副主任关于“目前国内外形势与财经工作”的报告和贸易部叶李壮部长关于“我国对外贸易政策及其与海关工作的关系”的报告。会议最后由孔原署长作总结报告。孔署长着重指出共同纲领和刘少奇副主席“五一”报告中关于新中国海关政策的指示对于海关工作的重大意义。他说：今天中国人民已将自己大门的钥匙拿在自己手中，受帝国主义控制的旧海关已随着半封建半殖民地旧中国的统治一起灭亡。孔署长指出：这次会议解决了海关改革与建设中的许多中心问题，今后海关全体新老干部必须团结一致地为完成海关的历史大变革，为建设中华人民共和国的新海关而奋斗。孔署长特别勉励大家要切实遵守共同纲领第十八条的规定，厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。
