Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: The first defecting civil aviation airplane, "Air Palace 610," was renamed "Beijing," and the naming ceremony was held this afternoon. The plane defected in Hong Kong and flew to Beijing on November 9th of last year. Liu Jingyi and Chen Zhuolin, the general managers of the defecting China and Central aviation companies, as well as other personnel, arrived in Beijing with the plane. At today's naming ceremony, Zhong Chibing, Director of the Civil Aviation Bureau of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, spoke first. Director Zhong pointed out: The plane was named after Beijing, the capital of the People's China, at the request of all civil aviation personnel and with the approval of the Central People's Government. This is not only an honor for the plane's pilots but also an honor for all civil aviation personnel. Director Zhong encouraged all civil aviation personnel to maintain this honor. This requires diligently studying, enhancing political awareness, strengthening unity, and firmly establishing the will to serve the people; it also requires strengthening organization and discipline, and improving technical skills and professional knowledge. Representatives from the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Li Tao, and You Jiang, the head of the Aviation Department of the North China Military Region, also spoke, as did Pan Guoding, the chief pilot of the plane. Finally, Tang Kai, Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Bureau, cut the ribbon. The plane will now participate in civil aviation transportation. (Attached picture)
