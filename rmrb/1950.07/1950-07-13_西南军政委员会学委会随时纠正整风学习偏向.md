Local Rectification Dynamics

    [This newspaper's dispatch] The rectification study movement in various departments, offices, and agencies under the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee has gradually unfolded. Most units attach great importance to study, and the comrades' attention has been focused on learning. However, some units still do not pay enough attention to rectification study, and mobilization is not thorough enough, resulting in some deviations. The General Academic Committee has promptly corrected these. When the Bristle Company mobilized, they did not conduct research beforehand. At the meeting, they temporarily found a cadre who had only been with the company for half a day and did not understand the company's situation to give a report. When the branch of the Work Inspection Committee was established, there was no prior planning or deliberation, and people were temporarily discussed and selected at the meeting, resulting in no one speaking. The company also mistakenly stipulated that anyone over the age of fifty could freely participate in rectification study (which has now been corrected). In a few units, because the mobilization was not thorough, some new cadres still have a fear of rectification or hold a liberal attitude. A new comrade in the Water Conservancy Department said, "Rectify if you want, I don't have any bureaucracy; I'm just afraid of rectifying liberalism, because I've committed almost every one of the eleven points of liberalism that Chairman Mao pointed out." Individual members of the Youth League in the Reception Office are afraid of taking responsibility for making personal suggestions, saying, "It's best to pass all suggestions collectively before making them." Some people are also afraid that rectification will cost them their jobs; others are afraid that old cadres will retaliate if they make suggestions, or think that rectification is for old cadres at the section chief level and above, and that they are not among those being rectified, so they are not very concerned. The General Academic Committee of the Military and Administrative Committee has, based on these situations, urged the relevant responsible comrades to carry out further in-depth mobilization, and instructed them to use large and small meetings and individual talks in the study to correct various incorrect understandings, so that the rectification movement can achieve the expected results.

    西南军政委员会学委会随时纠正整风学习偏向
    【本报讯】西南军政委员会所属各部、处、行的整风学习运动已逐步展开。大多数单位对学习十分重视，同志们的注意力已经集中在学习上。但尚有少数单位对整风学习不够重视，动员不够深入，因此发生一些偏向。总学委会已及时进行纠正。猪鬃公司动员时事前不进行研究，开会时，临时找了一位刚到公司才半天不了解公司情况的干部作报告。成立工作检查委员会分会时，事先不计划也不酝酿，临时在大会上讨论选几个人，结果无人发言。该公司还错误地规定了凡五十岁以上者可自由参加整风学习（现已纠正）。有少数单位因为动员不深入，新干部中还有人对整风怀有畏惧心理或持自由主义态度。水利部有位新同志说：“整就整，反正我没有官僚主义；我就怕整自由主义，因为毛主席所指的自由主义十一条，我差不多条条都犯。”交际处个别青年团员怕个人提意见负责任，说“提意见时最好全体通过再提。”有的人还怕整风整掉饭碗；有的人还怕提了意见老干部报复，或者以为整风是整科长以上的老干部，自己不在被整之列，因而不太关心。军政委员会总学委会已根据这些情况，督促各有关负责同志作更进一步的深入动员，并指示在学习中利用大会小会和个别谈话方式，纠正各种不正确认识，使整风运动能收到预期成效。
