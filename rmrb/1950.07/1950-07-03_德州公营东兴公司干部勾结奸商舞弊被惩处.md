　　Cadres of Dezhou Public-Operated Dongxing Company Punished for Colluding with Unscrupulous Merchants in Malpractice

　　Cadres of the Shandong Dezhou Public-Operated Dongxing Company, who colluded with unscrupulous merchants in bribery and embezzlement, have been punished by the Shandong judicial organs. This company was established in October 1949, with three factories directly under it: Minxing Flour Mill, Dongxing Oil Mill, and Dongxing Coal Plant. The predecessor of Dongxing Company was Dongxing Goods Station, which, in addition to its own business operations and acting as an agent for buying and selling goods, mainly sold coal dross.

　　In May 1949, Zhang Meisan, the deputy manager of Dongxing Company (who was actually responsible for the manager's duties), was introduced to Zhang Jixian, the manager of Jufeng and an unscrupulous merchant, by a salesman. Zhang Jixian recognized Zhang Meisan as his uncle. From then on, he tried his best to win over the main cadres of Dongxing Company and engage in bribery. Those who received bribes from Zhang Jixian included Deputy Manager Zhang Meisan (who received 350,000 yuan, one bag of flour, and two gold rings), Wang Dianhuai, the director of the Business Section and director of the Oil Mill (who received 5,224,000 yuan, two gold rings, and one piece of clothing material), Wang Jiyuan, the director of the Accounting Section (who received 300,000 yuan, one pen, and one gold ring), Accountant Yin Tailiang (who received 150,000 yuan, one pen, and one gold ring), Liang Youkui, the director of the Secretary Section (who received 100,000 yuan), Wang Limin, the director of the Flour Mill (who received 100,000 yuan, one watch, one bag of flour, and one woolen sweater), salesman Miao Fuchun (who received 100,000 yuan, one pen, and one overcoat), and Sun Boren (who received one overcoat). Wang Dianhuai and salesman Guo Ziming even openly negotiated terms with Zhang Jixian in Jinan, embezzling more than 5 million yuan, and colluded with Litong Goods Station in Tianjin to create false receipts, embezzling more than 14 million yuan. After the cadres of Dongxing Company received bribes from the unscrupulous merchants, they sold coal dross to Zhang Jixian at prices lower than the market price, resulting in a loss equivalent to 88,066 catties of millet. Due to cadre embezzlement and the misuse of public funds, as well as the impact of rising prices, the loss was equivalent to 42,099 catties of millet. The Dezhou Municipal Government discovered signs of embezzlement in the company last winter and sent personnel to reorganize it, but they did not conduct an in-depth investigation. Instead, they promoted Wang Dianhuai, who came from a gangster background, to the position of Director of the Business Section, and promoted Wang Jiyuan, who had been a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League for seven or eight years, to the position of Director of the Accounting Section. It was not until this spring, when personnel were sent for a second reorganization, that the full extent of the problem was discovered after Wang Dianhuai, fearing punishment, absconded with funds and was arrested. Furthermore, Che Zhenhua, the manager and head of the Finance and Grain Section of the company, was aware of the embezzlement but did not report it in a timely manner or investigate it. He also failed to strictly criticize and correct the company's chaotic system and the cadres' casual use of public funds, demonstrating an irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause.

　　Currently, the main culprits of the embezzlement in Dongxing Company, such as Zhang Meisan, Wang Dianhuai, and Wang Jiyuan, have been dismissed from their posts and detained. The unscrupulous merchant Zhang Jixian has also been arrested and his property has been seized. This case has been reported to the Shandong Provincial Government's judicial organs and will be punished according to the law.

　　德州公营东兴公司干部勾结奸商舞弊被惩处
    山东德州公营东兴公司干部勾结奸商，受贿贪污，被山东司法机关惩处。该公司成立于一九四九年十月，下面直属三个厂：民兴面粉厂、东兴制油厂和东兴煤厂。东兴公司前身是东兴货栈，除自己经营业务及代理客货买卖外，主要是贩卖煤楂。
    一九四九年五月间，东兴公司副经理张美三（实际上负经理责任），由营业员介绍认识聚丰经理奸商张继先。张继先自认张美三为叔。从此，他便极力拉拢东兴公司主要干部，进行贿赂。先后受张继先贿赂者，有副经理张美三（得三十五万元、面粉一袋、金戒指二个），营业课主任兼制油厂厂长王殿槐（得五百二十二万四千元、金戒指二个、衣料一件），会计科主任王纪元（得三十万元、钢笔一枝、金戒指一个），会计尹太良（得十五万元、钢笔一枝、金戒指一个），秘书课主任梁有奎（得十万元），面粉厂长王利民（得十万元、手表一个、面粉一袋、毛衣一件），营业员苗复春（得十万元、钢笔一枝、大衣一件）及孙伯仁（得大衣一件）。王殿槐与营业员郭子明并在济南公开与张继先讲条件，贪污了五百余万元，又在天津勾通利通货栈制造假单据，贪污款项一千四百余万元。东兴公司干部先后得了奸商的贿赂后，即以低于市场的价格贱卖煤楂给张继先，损失合小米八万八千零六十六斤。干部贪污，套用公款，受物价上涨影响，损失合小米四万二千零九十九斤。德州市政府去冬即发现该公司有贪污迹象，曾派员整理，但未作深入检查，反而提拔流氓出身的王殿槐为营业课主任，提拔曾当了七、八年三青团员的王纪元为会计课主任。直至今春第二次派员前往整理时，王殿槐畏罪卷款潜逃被逮捕后才全盘发觉。其次，该公司经理兼财粮科长车振华，对贪污事实，早已知情，但未及时报告，也不加追究。对公司制度紊乱，干部随便动支公款，也不作严格批评和纠正，表现了对人民事业不负责任的态度。
    现东兴公司各贪污主犯，如张美三、王殿槐、王纪元等，已被撤职扣押。奸商张继先亦已逮捕归案，并查封其财产。此案已呈报山东省府司法机关，即将依法惩办。
