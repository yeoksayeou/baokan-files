　　The Fate of American Aggressors Will Be No Better Than Hitler's!
    Ding Li
    American aggressors have provoked the Korean civil war and directly participated in the war! We are extremely indignant at this bandit behavior that plunges the Korean people into the disaster of war and undermines world peace!
    We believe that this is not merely a brutal aggression and massacre against the Korean people; in fact, it is a shameless provocation by the American robbers against all peace-loving and progressive people in the world!
    The Chinese people have not forgotten that the American aggressors were, and still are, enemies of the Chinese people. Today, when the Chinese people have eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the mainland and are about to finally and completely complete the national liberation, it openly dispatches fleets in an attempt to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan. Obviously, it dreams of directly interfering in the Chinese people's liberation cause through war adventures! -- We will respond to this act of aggression with facts!
    We know that all these acts of aggression are merely a probe for its war against the Soviet Union, against communism, against new democratic countries, and against all peaceful people. It can have no other effect than to frighten the neurasthenic. We know that this ferocious behavior is merely a manifestation of panic under the impact of the great wave of the worldwide movement for peace and democracy! The myth of the invincibility of the Hitler bandit gang has long been shattered, and the fate of the successor to the mantle of fascism—the American aggressor—will be no better than Hitler's!
    We warn the American aggressors: The people who defend world peace and fight for peace are invincible! This is an indisputable truth. The heroic Korean people struck at the invaders and turned to counter-offensive. In the first three weeks of the war, the Korean People's Army advanced more than 200 kilometers and liberated about two-fifths of the territory of South Korea. The Li Chengwan bandit army has been largely annihilated and is in complete disarray. Although the ground forces of the American aggressors have repeatedly resisted stubbornly, they have only tragically proved the unchangeable fact of the "paper tiger"; they cannot stop the will of the Korean people to fight against the aggressors and for democratic peace—this is also the will of the Chinese people, and also the common will of all peace-loving and progressive people in the world. This will is the source of victory and strength!

　　美国侵略者的命运并不会比希特勒好些！
    丁里
    美国侵略者挑起了朝鲜内战，并且直接参战了！面对着这种把朝鲜人民投入战争的灾难，破坏世界和平的盗匪行为，我们异常愤慨！
    我们认为这不仅仅是对朝鲜人民的横暴的侵略与虐杀；实际上，这正是美国强盗对全世界爱好和平的进步人类的无耻的挑衅！
    中国人民并没有忘记：美国侵略者曾经是，今天依然是在与中国人民为敌。今天，当中国人民已在大陆上消灭了蒋介石匪帮，即将最后彻底完成全国解放的时候，它公然出动舰队，企图阻挠我解放台湾。显然地，它是梦想用战争的冒险来直接干涉中国人民的解放事业了！——我们会用事实来回答这种侵略行动的！
    我们知道，这一切侵略行为，只不过是它反苏、反共、反新民主主义国家及一切和平人民的战争的试探，它除了对神经衰弱的人能发生恐吓作用之外是再也起不了什么作用的。我们知道这种穷凶极恶的行为，只不过是在全世界争取和平民主运动的巨大浪潮冲击下的一种惊惶失措的表现！希特勒匪帮的不可战胜的神话早已破灭了，法西斯衣钵的继承人——美国侵略者的命运，并不会比希特勒好些！
    我们警告美国侵略者：保卫世界和平与为和平而战的人民是不可战胜的！这已是千真万确的真理。英勇的朝鲜人民打击了进犯者并转入反攻，战争的头三个星期，朝鲜人民军前进二百余公里，解放了南鲜大约五分之二的国土，李承晚匪军已被歼灭大半溃不成军。美国侵略者的地面部队虽然一再顽抗，只不过悲惨地证明了“纸老虎”这一不可改变的事实；阻止不了朝鲜人民为反抗侵略者、为民主和平而战的意志，——这也是中国人民的意志，也是全世界爱好和平的进步人类的共同的意志。这个意志就是胜利与力量的源泉！
