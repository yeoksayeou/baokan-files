The government leads the masses to actively eliminate pests

    Boye cotton aphids basically eliminated

    Qingyuan lacks leadership in pest control; many farmers plow up and destroy cotton fields

    [This newspaper, Boye News] The cotton fields in Boye County, Hebei Province, have been basically cleared of aphids after pest control measures, and the affected cotton seedlings have grown three or four new leaves, and some are already flowering. The farmers are in high spirits and are now universally cultivating seedlings and preparing to apply top dressing. This year, the county planted more than 160,000 mu of cotton, accounting for 44.6% of the county's cultivated land area. In early May, when the cotton seedlings grew to two or three inches, aphids were discovered one after another. The most seriously affected areas included 54 villages, with as many as 300 aphids per seedling, and no fewer than 60 or 70, hindering the growth of the cotton seedlings.

    After the outbreak of aphids, the County People's Government and the Boye County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately organized cadres to go to the countryside and, together with district and village cadres, led the masses to universally use tobacco ash water and tobacco lime water to eliminate the pests. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office also transported 300 sprayers and a large amount of rotenone powder, which were distributed to areas more seriously affected by insect pests. After days of pest control, coupled with no rain for half a month, the cotton aphids had been basically eliminated by the beginning of June. In the 50-odd villages that were severely affected by aphids, the cotton seedlings have grown three or four new leaves, the lightly affected areas have grown to about a foot, and some are already flowering. The cotton in the Third District has begun to be stripped of its lower leaves.

    The elimination of cotton aphids and the emergence of new cotton seedlings have greatly encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for production. They have universally carried out careful cultivation, some cultivating six times, the general cultivation being four times, and the least cultivation being three times. At present, the county's farmers are buying fine fertilizer to prepare for top dressing. According to incomplete statistics from 160 households in Beixiaowang Village, Second District, the masses have prepared more than 80,000 jin of bean cake, which can be applied at more than 50 jin per mu.

    [Baoding News] Hebei Daily News: Qingyuan County's pest control work remains at the level of slogans, so the insect plague is developing seriously, and farmers are plowing up and destroying many cotton seedlings.

    From late May to early June in Qingyuan, cotton seedlings successively suffered from anthracnose, seedling blight, and aphids, and the cotton seedlings were seriously damaged. Now some cotton seedlings have withered and died, some are huddled and shriveled, and some are only two or three inches high. The masses have lost confidence in cotton. Some people have destroyed the cotton and prepared to plant other crops. According to the report of the Second District Government on June 15, 30% of the cotton seedlings have been destroyed in Jiangzhuang, Xiezhuang, and other three villages. More than half of Zhang Deng Village has been destroyed. According to the statistics of 63 households in six villages, namely Nanxinzhuang, Beixinzhuang, Dazhuze, Dongxiaozhuang, and Xixiaozhuang in the Sixth District, 120 mu of cotton seedlings have been destroyed. Thirteen households in Tengzhuang destroyed 40 mu. Seven households in Nanda Ran Village destroyed 14 mu. Some bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: "Calling for more cotton planting is going against the will of heaven, and planting more will not yield more. Whoever destroys it is right!" Another part of the people hold a "wait and see" attitude and do not repair the cotton, do not remove pests, or weed. In Nan, Zhongran Village, there are more than 200 mu of cotton, and the grass is taller than the seedlings, and some have not even been thinned. Some village cadres, seeing the destruction of cotton seedlings, did not think of ways to help the masses eliminate pests and diseases, but instead followed the masses and destroyed them, and even individual ones took the lead in destroying them. Zhang Cai, the secretary of the Zhongran Village branch, has not yet thinned his six mu of cotton seedlings. Wu Cuihua, the director of the Women's Federation, destroyed her own two mu, and the masses followed suit. Some village cadres, seeing district cadres coming to the village, asked the district cadres for pest control methods, and the district cadres could not say anything, and the village cadres shouted: "There is no way, it must be destroyed!" However, there are also individual village cadres who have not looked at the actual situation and have simply taken restrictive measures. For example, the cadres of Xiwangyao Village in the Sixth District held a mass meeting and announced that whoever destroys it would be responsible, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses.

    The reason for this phenomenon is, first of all, some leading cadres in the county and district have a bureaucratic work style. In most areas, they only shout empty slogans about aphid control, and few have taken practical actions. The masses' ideas of relying on heaven and complacency are still very serious. Since June, there have been two rains, and the aphids have decreased slightly. Cadres and the masses think that once it rains, the cotton will grow up, and pests and diseases will not matter. Secondly, the county and district organizations are being reorganized, some cadres are emotionally unstable, and at the same time, the contradiction between wheat harvesting and pest control has not been well resolved. Facts have proved that the problems existing in the county are very serious, and leading cadres should immediately organize forces to study effective methods, guide the masses to eliminate aphids, cultivate seedlings, and replant seedlings, so as to achieve the preservation and harvest of cotton.

　　政府领导群众积极除治
    博野棉蚜基本消灭
    清苑除虫缺乏领导农民耕毁棉田甚多
    【本报博野讯】河北博野县棉田蚜虫，经过除治后得到基本消灭，受害棉苗已长出三、四个新叶，有的已在开花。农民情绪很高，现正普遍进行锄苗与准备施追肥。该县今年种棉十六万余亩，占全县耕地面积的百分之四十四点六。到五月上旬棉苗长到二、三寸时，即先后发现了蚜虫，最重的有五十四个村，每棵苗上多的有三百余个，少的也不下六、七十个，阻碍着棉苗的成长。
    蚜虫发生后，该县人民政府和中共博野县委立即组织干部下乡，协同区、村干部领导群众，普遍利用烟草硝灰水、烟草石灰水进行除治。同时，河北省棉产改进处亦运来三百架喷雾器及大批鱼藤粉，发到各受虫灾较重地区。经过连日除治，再加半月未雨，到六月初，已将棉蚜基本消灭。受蚜害较重的五十余村棉苗已长出三、四个新叶，轻的已长到尺许，有的已在开花。三区棉花已开始捋腿。
    棉蚜的消灭和棉苗新叶的出现，大大鼓舞了农民的生产情绪，普遍进行了细锄，有的锄了六遍，一般的锄过四遍，最少的也锄了三遍。目前该县农民正在纷纷购买细肥准备上追肥。据二区北小王村一百六十户的不完全统计，群众已备妥豆饼八万多斤，每亩可上五十多斤。
    （博野县委宣传部萧菀华）
    【保定讯】河北日报消息：清苑县除虫工作，停留在口号上，因此虫灾向严重发展，农民耕毁棉苗很多。
    清苑自五月下旬到六月初，棉苗相继发生炭疽病、立枯病和蚜虫，棉苗受到严重危害。现在棉苗有的枯死，有的抱头、卷缩，有的才长二、三寸高。群众对棉花失掉信心。有些人毁掉棉花准备种其他作物。据六月十五日二区政府的报告：蒋庄、谢庄等三村，毁去棉苗百分之三十。张登村毁的超过半数。六区南辛庄、北辛庄、大祝泽、东小庄、西小庄等六个村六十三户统计，已毁棉苗一百二十亩。藤庄十三户毁了四十亩。南大冉村七户毁了十四亩。有的坏分子趁机造谣说：“叫多种棉花是逆天行事，多种不多收。谁毁了谁对事儿！”另外一部分人抱着“看看再说”的态度，对棉花不修理，不除虫、锄草。中冉村南，有二百多亩棉花，草比苗还高，有的还没间苗。有的村干部见到毁棉苗，没有想法帮助群众除治病虫害，反倒跟着群众也毁起来，甚至个别的带头毁。中冉村支部书记张才，六亩棉苗现在还没间苗。妇会主任吴翠花毁了自己的二亩，影响的群众也跟着毁起来。有些村干部见区干部到村，就问区干除虫办法，区干部说不上来，村干部就嚷：“没办法了，非毁不行！”但也有个别村干部，没看实际情况，单纯采取限制的办法。如六区西王尧村干部，召开了群众大会，宣布谁毁谁负责任，引起群众不满。
    所以造成这种现象，首先，县、区某些领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，大部地区，对除蚜工作，只在上面空喊，实际行动的还不多。群众的靠天思想与麻痹思想仍很严重。六月以来连下两场雨，蚜虫略显减少，干部、群众思想上即认为一下雨棉花长大了，病虫害都不要紧了。其次，县区组织整编，部分干部情绪不稳，同时麦收与除虫矛盾，未能很好解决。事实证明，该县所存问题是很严重的，领导干部应马上组织力量，研究有效办法，干导群众除蚜、锄苗、补苗，以便达到棉花的保种保收。
