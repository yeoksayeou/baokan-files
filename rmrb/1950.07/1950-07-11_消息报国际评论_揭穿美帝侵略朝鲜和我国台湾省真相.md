　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 9th: *Izvestia's* international commentary points out: It can be seen from many recent reports in the American press that the decision of the United States to invade Korea and for the U.S. armed forces to occupy a part of Chinese territory – Taiwan – was decided during the talks between MacArthur, Jenson Bradley, and Dulles. Washington correspondents Reston, Childs, and others said in their reports that Jenson and Bradley brought a secret memorandum from MacArthur to Truman when they arrived in Washington on June 24th. This memorandum predetermined the content of the infamous statement issued by the U.S. President on June 27th. According to the American financial weekly *Barron's*, MacArthur's secret memorandum prompted Truman to issue his statement on June 27th. These reports fully expose the fiction of the North Korean People's Army "attacking" South Korea first. They also illustrate that Truman's statement was by no means the result of the Security Council's illegal resolution; on the contrary, the Security Council's hostile actions against peace were manipulated by the United States, and the U.S. government had already begun to implement its long-planned aggression.

    揭穿美帝侵略朝鲜和我国台湾省真相
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：消息报的国际评论指出：从最近美国报纸的许多报道中可以看出，美国侵略朝鲜及美国武装部队占领中国领土的一部分——台湾的决定，是在麦克阿瑟与詹逊·布莱德雷及杜勒斯会谈时所议决的。驻华盛顿记者莱斯顿、柴尔茨及其他记者在消息中都说，詹逊与布莱德雷六月二十四日到华盛顿时带来了麦克阿瑟致杜鲁门的秘密备忘录。这个备忘录预先决定了美国总统六月二十七日发表的臭名远扬的声明的内容。据美国金融周刊《拜龙》（译音）载称，麦克阿瑟的秘密备忘录促使杜鲁门于六月二十七日发表他的声明。这些消息充分地揭穿了所谓北朝鲜人民军先行“进攻”南朝鲜的虚构。它们并说明：杜鲁门的声明绝不是安理会非法决议的结果，恰巧相反，安理会对和平的敌意行动是美国所操纵的，美国政府已开始在实施它早就计划好了的侵略。
