Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 27th: A delayed dispatch: A unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army liberated Wai Lingding Island and the Sanmen Islands outside the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong Province at the beginning of this month. Since landing on the Wanshan Islands on May 25th, our army has successively liberated 31 large and small islands in the Wanshan, Da-Xiao Zhizhu, and Sanmen archipelagos over the past month. In the successive battles, our army annihilated more than 500 Kuomintang remnant bandits who had fled to various islands. The bandit "Second Fleet" has been completely annihilated by our army, including sinking seven bandit ships such as the No. 26, capturing one bandit gunboat No. 25 (which sank after being captured), and damaging many bandit ships of the Tai, Zhong, and Yong classes, as well as seizing many other war trophies. Qi Zhihong, commander of the bandit "Second Fleet," has also been killed by our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The bandit suppression troops of the Guangdong Military Region annihilated more than 15,000 bandits in June. At present, bandit gangs in the core areas of the Xijiang and Pearl River Delta, Chaozhou, Shantou, Xingning, Meixian, and Beijiang Fogang, Yingde, and Yangshan in Guangdong Military Region have been basically eliminated. Only a few bandit gangs with less than 100 people remain in areas such as Fangcheng, Hepu, Qin County, Lingshan, Nanpeng Island, Dongjiang, and Taishan. These remaining bandit gangs can also be basically eliminated in a short period of time. In the bandit suppression operations in recent months, the bandit suppression troops of the Guangdong Military Region have resolutely implemented the policy of combining leniency with suppression in bandit suppression. In terms of bandit suppression methods, the political offensive was the main method, mobilizing the masses to disintegrate the bandits, achieving the purpose of dividing the internal affairs of the bandits, isolating a few stubborn bandit secret agent elements, and winning over a large number of bandits to surrender to our army. For example, among the bandit annihilation figures, those who surrendered accounted for 28% in April, 31% in May, and 56% in June, showing a rapidly increasing trend month by month.
