　　"Small Farm"
    -- Introducing the Promotion of Warm Water Seed Soaking Method in Anyang
    After the agricultural technology group of Niangniangmiao Village, Eighth District, Anyang, Pingyuan, explained the benefits of warm water seed soaking in the people's school, the masses said with skepticism: "It sounds good, but who knows if it will scald the seeds? Will they even sprout!" Gao Yongfang, a district cadre, and the technology group immediately decided to conduct an on-site experiment. They designated two fen of land in the village school's grounds, calling it the "Small Farm." This was a novel idea, and more than a hundred farmers were attracted to the small farm. Everyone contributed some seeds. The technology group used three methods for the experiment: "two parts boiling water and one part cold water," "two parts cold water and one part boiling water," and "no soaking." These three types of seeds were planted in eleven seedbeds separately. After planting, the masses were particularly concerned, going to see and check on them, some secretly digging to see if the seeds were scalded to death. The women were worried that they wouldn't sprout and eagerly wanted to water them. They waited and waited, and then they sprouted. The seedlings really came out. The "soaked" ones sprouted a *duishi* (a day and a night) earlier than the "unsoaked" ones. The masses were both surprised and happy; the concerns about warm water seed soaking were eliminated. The seed soaking technology was successfully promoted throughout the village. Among the 242 farming households, 170 households soaked their seeds.
    When the district discovered the method of establishing small farms in Niangniangmiao, they believed that small farms played a significant role in guiding and promoting agricultural technology, so they reported it to the county. The county committee then organized cadres from various districts and villages to spread the method of establishing small farms in various districts and villages at the Party Congress and cadre meetings, calling on every village to establish a small farm. In less than ten days, more than forty villages in the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Districts had established small farms. They are now actively experimenting with and promoting warm water seed soaking methods in conjunction with summer planting. Lü Dongxiu, the women's chairperson of Xijie Town, Shuiye Town, Sixth District, and other cadres personally experimented with seed soaking and seed mixing, calling on everyone to experiment. Under their active promotion, the whole town organized eleven technology groups to conduct 110 experiments (including household experiments using flowerpots); and using the special conditions of the market town, under the leadership of the town government, the Youth League, the Women's Congress, and the Workers' Congress jointly organized four propaganda groups, carrying millet seedlings grown in flowerpots, beating gongs and drums, to promote and explain to the masses in the streets, fields, riverbanks, and other crowded places. The crowded masses followed the propaganda group, watching and enthusiastically discussing with each other. Farmers who came to the market listened to the explanation and said: "This method is really good. Soaking the seeds makes the seedlings sprout earlier and stronger. I have to try it when I go back." Currently, the experience of the small farm has spread throughout the county and has gained the trust and support of the broad masses. Small farms are being universally established in every village in the county.

　　“小农场”
    ——介绍安阳推广温汤浸种办法
    平原安阳八区娘娘庙村农业技术小组，在民校里讲了温汤浸种的好处以后，群众半信半疑地说：“说得倒好，谁知道烫坏种籽烫不坏？是不是能出来呀！”区干部高永芳和技术小组当即决定实地试验。在村学校的地中划出二分来，叫做“小农场”。这是一个新奇的事儿，一百多个农民都被吸引到小农场来了，你一把我一把凑了些种籽。技术小组即用“二份开水一份凉水”，“二份凉水一份开水”，以及“不浸种”三种方法进行实验。用这三种种子分别种在十一个畦子上。种上以后，群众特别关心，这个去看，那个去瞧，有的偷偷扒开看看种籽烫死了没有？妇女们怕出不来，急的要浇水。盼着，盼着，发芽了。苗子真的出来了。“浸种”的比“不浸种”的早出一个对时（一天一夜）。群众又稀罕又高兴；温烫浸种的顾虑消除了。全村浸种技术顺利的开展了。在二百四十二户农民中，浸种的就有一百七十户。
    当区里发现娘娘庙创办小农场的办法以后，认为小农场对指导及推广农业技术的作用很大，就向县里汇报。县委会随即在党代会及干部会上，组织各区、村干部在各区村传播建立小农场的办法，号召村村建立小农场。此后不到十天光景，四、六、八、九区已有四十余村建立了小农场。现在正结合夏种积极试验和推广温汤浸种的方法。六区水冶镇西街妇女主席吕东秀以及其他干部亲自试验浸种、拌种，号召大家都试验。在他们积极的推动下，全街组织了十一个技术小组，进行了一百一十处的试验（包括家庭用花盆试验）；并运用集镇的特殊条件，在镇公所领导下，由青年团、妇代会、工代会共同组织了四个宣传组，抬着用花盆试验出来的谷苗，打着锣鼓，到大街、场里、河边，以及其他人多的地方向群众宣传、讲解。拥挤的人群跟着宣传组，一面看，一面热烈地互相讨论。赶集的农民听了讲解以后说：“这个办法就是不错。浸种，苗出得又早又肥，回去得试一试。”目前小农场的经验，已传遍了全县，获得了广大群众的信任和拥护。小农场正在全县各村普遍的建立起来。
