　　[本报讯] A rally of more than 8,000 women from all walks of life in Beijing was held at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace at 7:30 p.m. on the 23rd, to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. More than 8,000 people shouted slogans such as "Oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan!" "Oppose American imperialism's attack on Korea!" "Support the Korean people's war of liberation!" "Oppose wars of aggression, defend world peace!" The arrival of Korean Ambassador Li Zhouyuan's wife, Jin Yunzhu, and two other Korean guests was warmly welcomed by the masses. The conference was composed of a presidium of 14 women representatives from all walks of life, including Yang Yunyu. Chairman Yang Yunyu delivered the opening speech, explaining the significance of the meeting. Li Dequan, vice-chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting, calling on women from all over the city and all the people of Beijing and China to resolutely support Premier Zhou's solemn statement, fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, and actively assist the Korean people.

　　This was followed by speeches by women from all walks of life. Female worker representative Zhou Zhongling said: "The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day. If the American imperialists dare to risk expanding the war of aggression and destroying world peace, then German fascism will be their example." Peasant representative Fu Li said: "We must work hard in production under the leadership of Chairman Mao, support the front, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and drive American imperialism out of China." Female student representative Zhao Shufang said: "The Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world are like brothers and sisters.

Laboring women's representative Yu Shuzhen said: "We women in the city must unite and fight to the end to defeat American imperialism! Defeat the reactionaries!"

    女工农妇家庭妇女一致反对美国侵略
    朝鲜来宾出席大会受到群众热烈欢迎
    【本报讯】北京市各界妇女八千余人于二十三日下午七时半在劳动人民文化宫举行了反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动大会。八千多人齐声高呼“反对美帝国主义侵略台湾！”“反对美帝国主义进攻朝鲜！”“援助朝鲜人民解放战争！”“反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平！”等口号。朝鲜李周渊大使夫人金云竹和其他两位朝鲜来宾的到会，受到群众的热烈欢迎。大会由各界妇女代表杨蕴玉等十四人组成主席团。主席杨蕴玉致开会辞，说明开会的意义。全国民主妇联副主席李德全到会讲话，号召全市妇女和全北京、全中国人民一道坚决拥护周总理的严正声明，为解放台湾斗争到底，并积极援助朝鲜人民。
    当朝鲜李周渊大使夫人金云竹出现在主席台时，大会响起了长久的掌声。许多人挤到台前，希望更清楚地聆听这位国际友人的正义呼声。
    随后是各界妇女讲话。女工代表周仲玲说：“以苏联为首的和平民主阵营正日益壮大，假如美帝敢于冒险扩大侵略战争，破坏世界和平，那么，德国法西斯就是他的榜样。”农妇代表傅李氏说：“我们要在毛主席领导下努力生产，支援前线，消灭蒋匪帮，把美帝国主义赶出中国去。”女学生代表赵淑芳说：“中国人民和全世界各国的人民如同兄弟姊妹一样，朝鲜人民的痛苦也就是我们的痛苦，我们一定要支援他们。”家庭妇女团体代表李健生说：“北京五十万家庭妇女是很大的力量，应该好好团结和组织起来，反对美帝的侵略。”劳动妇女代表俞淑贞说：“我们全市妇女要团结起来坚决打到底，打垮美国帝国主义！打垮反动派！”大会最后通过向毛主席和金日成将军致敬电二则，在高呼口号声中散会。会后并演映电影“赵一曼”。
    【又讯】大会同时举行了和平签名，参加签名的有三千余人，许多母亲自己签名后还替自己的孩子签名。
