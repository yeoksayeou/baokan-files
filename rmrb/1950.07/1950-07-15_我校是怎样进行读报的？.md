To the Editor:

Now, I would like to introduce our preliminary experiences from our newspaper reading group over the past three months. Our class has thirty students, divided into five groups, and the newspaper reading time is fixed every day. Initially, because newspaper reading lacked organization, students were not very enthusiastic about reading newspapers after business classes and read without focus. Later, one person was selected from each group to form a newspaper reading research group to assist the administration in the class's current affairs study.

For the past three months, we have been conducting current affairs studies as follows:

(1) Identifying Key Points: Initially, every three days, the research group would propose key learning points based on the content of the newspapers for students to refer to and discuss. Later, it was changed to students choosing their own key points, with groups taking turns to select them. On the one hand, the intention was to use this to discuss the news of the past few days within the group and attract everyone's attention. On the other hand, it also had a competitive nature. After a while, it was felt that selecting key points every three days was not as good as selecting them once a week, as it allowed for a more systematic approach to the news. Later, it was changed back to the research group being responsible for proposing learning key points, with each group conducting discussions. In this way, every student could have a clear understanding of the important current affairs issues that occurred within a week.

(2) Regular Quizzes: A quiz is held every two weeks, with the quiz format including fill-in-the-blanks, multiple-choice questions, and short answer questions. The quiz time is twenty minutes, and the papers are graded together after completion, with the scores announced. The individual with the best learning is also announced by name to show commendation. In this way, students generally pay attention to and value newspaper reading.

(3) Coordinating with Recreational Activities: Incorporating current affairs quizzes as part of the weekly class recreational activities. We have received very good results in this aspect.

(4) Establishing a Current Affairs Learning Column: If a group or individual sees something unclear in the newspaper or believes it is something that should be brought up for everyone to study, they can raise questions in the learning column and ask a certain group to answer them. This also encourages everyone to concentrate on reading newspapers and use their brains.

(5) Special Reports: When major domestic and international events develop to a certain stage, a student is responsible for collecting and organizing materials and giving a report to the whole class. In the past two months, we have done this on the following issues: "The London Three Foreign Ministers Conference," "The Struggle of the Japanese People," "The Current National Financial and Economic Situation," "The Colombo and Sydney Conferences," etc. The students' feedback is very good, but they feel that the reports should not be too rushed and superficial to accommodate time. The reports should be focused and as detailed as possible, as this is more helpful to the students.

In addition, we still have many shortcomings in newspaper reading. We have not yet held class-wide or group-wide joint seminars on major current affairs issues, and the work of organizing newspaper reading is still not done well enough. We are now summarizing our experiences in order to further develop newspaper reading in the next semester.

### 我校是怎样进行读报的？

　　我校是怎样进行读报的？编辑同志：
    现在把我们三个月来所获读报组的初步经验介绍一下。我们全班有三十人，分五个小组，读报时间每天是固定的。起初因为读报没有组织，致在业务课后，同学对看报不大起劲，而且无重点的看，后来才在每个小组中推出一人来，组成一个读报研究组，辅助行政进行全班的时事学习。
    三个月来，我们是这样进行时事学习的：
    （一）提出重点。先是每隔三天由研究组按报纸上的内容提出学习重点，供同学参考讨论。后来又改由同学自己选重点，小组轮流选，一方面想借此在小组内把几天消息讨论一下，引起大家的注意，另方面也有竞赛的性质。过了相当时候，又感到三天一选重点倒不如一周选一次，可以把消息系统起来。后来又改由研究组负责提出学习重点，由各小组进行讨论。这样，一周内所发生的重要时事问题，每一个同学都能明确起来。
    （二）定期测验：每两周举行测验一次，测验方式是填写空白、选择答案、问答等。测验时间为二十分钟，完毕共同评卷，并将分数公布。个人学习最好的，并公布其姓名，以示表扬。这样，同学们就普遍注意与重视读报了。
    （三）配合文娱活动：在每周班内的文娱活动中，把时事测验作为其内容之一，这一方面我们收到效果很好。
    （四）开辟时事学习栏：小组或个人在报纸上看到不明白或认为可以提起大家研究的地方，则在学习栏中提问题请某组解答，这样也引起了大家对看报的专心与开动脑筋。
    （五）专题报告：国内和国际大事，当发展到一定阶段时，即由一位同学负责收集整理材料，向全班同学作报告。两月来，我们这样做的有以下的问题：“伦敦三外长会议”、“日本人民的斗争情况”、“目前国家财政经济情况”、“科伦坡及悉尼会议”等。同学反映很好，只是觉得在报告时不必太迁就时间而粗枝大叶。报告时有重点，也要求尽量详尽，这样对同学更有帮助。
    此外，我们在读报方面还存在着很多缺点，对重大时事问题，尚未举行过全班或各组联合的座谈会，组织读报的工作也还做的不够。现在我们正在总结经验，以便在下学期更进一步的开展读报学习。
