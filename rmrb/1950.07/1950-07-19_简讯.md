    According to the explanation in the Korean Workers' Daily, July 24, 1948:

    The "star" is a symbol guiding the nation's path forward and historical direction.
    II. The national flag expresses the meaning of establishing and defending a prosperous and strong democratic state and fighting for world peace.

    III. The national flag expresses a bright and developing happy future.
    "White" is the radiant light of the sun, a symbol of bright development.
    In summary, the national flag expresses the meaning of correctly guiding the Korean people's path forward, establishing and defending the democratic state with the blood of all the people, and uniting the vast democratic forces to defend peace and enjoy a bright and developing happiness.
            II. Instructions for Making the Flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    ① The intersection of two lines dividing the entire flag into three equal lengths and two equal widths is the center of the red five-pointed star (close to the flagpole).
    ② The diameter of the white circle is equal to two-thirds of the width of the red part.
    ③ The distance from each corner of the red five-pointed star to the outer edge of the white circle is equal to one-half of the width of the white band.
    ④ The width of the white band is equal to one-sixth of the width of the blue part.
    ⑤ The width of each blue part is equal to one-sixth of the entire flag width. (The ratio of the flag's length to width is 2:1)
