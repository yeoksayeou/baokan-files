　　Changli Private Hongchang Flour Mill
    Improves Operations Based on Public Needs, Steadily Overcomes Lean Months, and Expands Business

    [This newspaper Changli dispatch] The Changli Private Hongchang Flour Mill has gradually corrected its business direction based on the needs of the people and has achieved considerable development.

    This mill was originally formed by the conversion of two private distilleries, Huichangyuan and Hongjiyong. After the distilleries closed down in April last year, they each opened small grocery stores to maintain their presence. Later, through persuasion and education by the local government, and after introducing them to visit Tianjin, they began to realize the future of machine production. They then pooled a capital of 240,000 jin of millet to establish the Hongchang Machine Flour Mill, which officially started producing flour in early November last year. Local state-owned enterprises helped solve some of the difficulties in capital turnover to support its development. At the same time, the mill also absorbed shares from others and actively promoted its finished products, thereby accelerating capital turnover and expanding business operations.

    However, after the Spring Festival, as flour production entered the off-season, sales gradually decreased, resulting in a situation where income could not cover expenses. The mill decided to further change its business strategy. Based on the habits of local farmers, in March, it added two sorghum milling machines and one new-style grain throwing machine, changing from making flour to milling sorghum and millet. At the same time, it made non-production personnel participate directly in production. After starting work, it accepted the processing of 440,000 jin of sorghum from the state-owned grain company and the Tangshan Prefectural Cooperative, which greatly helped the mill's production.

    In business, the mill adopted a policy of small profits and quick turnover, and also adhered to integrity, ensuring that goods were genuine and prices were fair. The mill once processed 10,000 jin of sorghum for Changli Normal School. It was originally estimated that 79 jin of rice could be produced per 100 jin, but the result was 81 jin. The mill paid accordingly, thereby increasing its prestige among the masses.

    Currently, under the efforts of both labor and management, the mill has steadily overcome the lean months and has developed while overcoming difficulties.

　　昌黎私营鸿昌制粉厂
    根据大众需要改进经营  稳步度过背月扩大业务
    【本报昌黎讯】昌黎私营鸿昌制粉厂，根据人民大众的需要，逐步端正经营方针，有了相当发展。
    该厂原系由汇昌源和鸿记永两家私营烧锅转业组成。去年四月烧锅停歇后，各自开设小杂货铺，维持门面。后经当地政府说服教育，并介绍他们到天津参观，开始认识到机器生产的发展前途，乃合股集中了二十四万斤小米的资本，设立鸿昌机器制粉厂，于去年十一月初正式出粉。当地国营企业为扶助其发展，帮助解决了部分资金周转的困难。同时该厂又吸收了他人的股金；并主动向外推销成品，因而加速了资金的流转，扩大了业务经营。
    但至春节后，因面粉生产进入背月，销路逐渐减少，形成入不敷出。该厂就决定进一步改变营业方针，根据当地农民习惯，于三月间添置了两台秫米机，一台新式甩谷机，改制面粉为碾秫米和小米，同时使非生产人员参加直接生产。开工后，就接受了国营粮食公司和唐山专署合作总社的四十四万斤秫米加工，使该厂生产得到有力帮助。
    在营业中，该厂采取了薄利多销的方针，并做到坚守信用，货真价实。该厂曾给昌黎师范加工碾秫米一万斤，原估计每百斤可出米七十九斤，但结果出了八十一斤，该厂即照实付给，因而提高了群众中的威信。
    现该厂在劳资双方努力经营下，已稳步地度过背月，并在克服困难中有了发展。
