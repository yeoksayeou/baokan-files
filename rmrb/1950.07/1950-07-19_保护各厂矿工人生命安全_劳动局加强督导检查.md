(News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency) In light of the continuous occurrence of worker injuries and deaths over the past two months in Beijing, and the frequent failure to report incidents promptly as required by government regulations, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau has decided to further strengthen supervision and inspection work, and to deliberate on appropriate punishments for those responsible for incidents.

According to existing statistics from the Labor Bureau, the number of workers injured or killed in public and private factories and mines in Beijing reached as high as 164 in May and June. Among them, 14 died. Specifically: 8 from Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory, 2 from Chengzi Coal Mine, and 1 each from Tianyi Coal Kiln, Beijing Municipal Telecommunications Bureau, Xinxi Tonghe Glass Kiln, and Yuhua Coal Kiln.

The main reason for the injuries and deaths is the paralysis in thinking on the part of the leadership of these factories and mines, and insufficient attention to the life safety of workers. For example, in the state-owned Xinhua Printing Factory, when personnel from the Labor Bureau went to the factory to inspect safety conditions, they found that the machines inside the factory were installed too close together, making it extremely easy for accidents to occur. They immediately suggested that the distance between the machines be increased. However, the factory administration did not take it seriously, simply saying: "The new factory building has not been built yet, so we have to make do for now. The workers are used to it and no accidents will happen." But as soon as they finished speaking, a worker was knocked down by a machine shaft and seriously injured. Afterwards, the Labor Bureau asked the factory to report the incident according to regulations, but they have ignored it to this day.

In order to correct this paralysis in thinking and disregard for government decrees, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, in addition to collaborating with relevant departments to deliberate on appropriate punishments for those responsible for incidents based on the severity of the circumstances, and to provide compensation and condolences to the injured and deceased workers, has decided that the Industrial and Mining Safety and Hygiene Committee will further strengthen supervision and inspection work. At the same time, it is ordered that all factories and mines that have not yet reported casualties in June must complete the reporting procedures by the end of July.

### 保护各厂矿工人生命安全  劳动局加强督导检查

　　保护各厂矿工人生命安全
    劳动局加强督导检查
    【京市新闻处讯】京市劳动局鉴于两个月来工人伤亡事件还是不断发生，且在事后又多不遵照政府规定立即呈报，决定进一步加强督导检查工作，并对肇事负责人分别议处。
    据劳动局现有材料统计，五、六两个月内京市公私营厂矿伤亡工人达一百六十四名之多。其中死亡十四名。计：辅华矿药厂八名，城子煤矿两名，天益煤窑、京市电信局和新西通合玻璃窑各一人，裕华煤窑一人。
    造成伤亡的主要原因，是这些厂矿的领导方面思想麻痹，对工人生命安全重视不够。如国营新华印刷厂，在劳动局派员到该厂检查安全情况时，发现厂内机器安装距离太近，极易发生危险，当即建议把机器的间距扩大。而该厂行政上并未重视，只是说：“新厂房没盖好，现在只好凑合凑合，工人习惯了，不会出事故。”但话刚说完，就有一个工人被机轴压倒，受了重伤。事后劳动局要该厂按规定呈报，但到现在还是置之不理。
    京市劳动局为纠正这种麻痹思想和忽视政府法令的现象，除协同各有关部门对肇事负责人按情节轻重分别议处，对伤亡工人进行善后抚恤外，决定由工矿安全卫生委员会进一步加强督导检查工作。同时并限令在六月份发生伤亡事故尚未申报的各厂矿，一律在七月底以前补办呈报手续。
