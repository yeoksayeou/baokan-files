　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 22nd: The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" published the questions posed by Philippe Vigier, Secretary-General of the French Republican Youth League and Director of "Avant-Garde," to Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on May 9, 1950, and Ho Chi Minh's replies. The full text is as follows:
　　(1) Question: What are the views of the Vietnamese government and people regarding the recognition of the Republic of Vietnam by the governments of the Soviet Union, China, and other democratic countries in Europe and Asia? Answer: Satisfied, excited, and grateful.
　　(2) Question: Could you comment on the open interference of American leaders in your country's affairs? Answer: This interference is anti-democratic and warmongering. It will inevitably meet the same fate as the interference in China.
　　(3) Question: What does your government consider to be the prerequisite for restoring peace? Answer: The complete withdrawal of French troops.
　　(4) Question: What are your views on the future relations between the Vietnamese nation and the Laotian and Cambodian nations? Answer: Fraternal relations on the basis of absolute equality and mutual respect for national independence.
　　(5) Question: One of the excuses used by the French rulers for continuing the war is that their "friends" will be massacred once the French army withdraws from Indochina. Could you explain the correct attitude of the Republic authorities towards these "collaborators"? Answer: Deal with them according to the law: pardon or punish them depending on their attitude today and in the future, but without massacring anyone.
　　(6) Question: In your opinion, what should be done about France using soldiers from North Africa or sub-Saharan Africa to fight alongside French soldiers and foreign mercenaries against your country? Answer: The best way is to eliminate the so-called "French Union." I hope that the people of these countries will unite and prevent their youth from being used in this "dirty war" and all other unjust wars.
　　(7) Question: Could you comment on the actions of the broad masses of the French people demanding an end to the Vietnam War? Answer: Grateful, wishing them success. The French people's struggle against the "dirty war" in Vietnam is also a struggle for France's independence and world peace.
　　(8) Question: Some French newspapers have been hyping up the fate of non-combatant French people and prisoners of war detained within your borders. Could you explain the situation of these French people and your government's intentions towards them? Answer: We do everything we can to guarantee their living conditions. I have received many letters from them expressing their gratitude.
　　(9) Question: What are your views on the future relations between your country and the French people? Answer: Brotherly and equal cooperation. I ask you to convey our friendship to the democratic French people whom we love and admire.

　　越南胡志明主席答斐盖尔问
    斥责美国对越进行干涉 
    认为法军撤出越南是恢复和平先决条件
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】法国共产党机关报《人道报》刊载了法兰西共和青年联盟总书记、《先锋》报社长斐盖尔一九五○年五月九日向越南民主共和国胡志明主席所提出的问题与胡志明的答复，全文如下：
    （一）问：越南政府和越南人民对于苏联政府、中国政府以及欧洲、亚洲其他民主国家承认越南共和国一事的看法如何？答：满意，兴奋，并且感激。
    （二）问：对于美国领袖们业已公开地干涉贵国事务一事，可否发表些意见？答：这种干涉是反民主的，好战的，这种干涉必定遭到与对中国干涉同样的命运。
    （三）问：贵政府认为恢复和平的先决条件是什么？答：法国军队全部撤退。
    （四）问：您对越南民族与老挝和柬埔寨民族之间的未来关系如何看法？答：在绝对平等基础上的兄弟关系，和对于民族独立的互相尊重。
    （五）问：法国统治者继续进行战争的借口之一是：一旦法国军队撤离印度支那，他们的“朋友们”将被虐杀。共和国当局对待这些“合作分子”的正确态度，可否予以说明？答：依照法律处理：视其今日和将来的态度而赦免或处罚，但不虐杀一人。
    （六）问：在您看来，法国利用北非或黑非洲背乡离井的士兵们来和法国士兵及外国雇佣兵比肩作战反对贵国，应该怎么办？答：最好的办法是消灭所谓“法兰西联邦”。我希望这些国家的人民团结起来，阻止他们的青年被利用于这个“卑污战争”及其他一切非正义的战争中。
    （七）问：您可否对于法国广大人民要求停止越南战争的行动，表示些意见？答：感激，敬祝成功。法国人民为反对越南“卑污战争”而斗争，同时就是为争取法国独立与全世界和平而斗争。
    （八）问：法国某些报纸对于拘禁在你们境内的非战斗的法国人及战俘的命运，大肆宣传。这些法国人情况如何，贵政府对他们的意向如何，可否加以说明？答：我们尽我们一切可能，保障他们的生活条件。我曾收到不少他们表示感激的信件。
    （九）问：您对贵国与法国人民之间的未来关系，如何看法？答：兄弟般的平等地位的合作。我请你向我们所爱的和敬佩的民主的法国人民，转达我们的友谊。
