Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Regarding the question of how to eliminate responsibility accidents in electricity production, various places have created many examples in the past six months. The Fengshan Power Plant, under the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau, has not had any accidents for more than half a year; the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau Power Plant and the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau No. 1 Power Plant have also achieved safe power generation for more than two months recently.

One of the important links in eliminating responsibility accidents is doing a good job in machine overhaul. According to statistics, among the 45 major accidents that occurred in power plants in North China in the second quarter, accidents caused by poor overhaul accounted for 53.3%. Planned and regular overhaul work is one of the important tasks for this year decided by the National Electricity Conference in February. Since the beginning of this year, the Fengshan Power Plant has carried out monthly overhauls, and they have been done very carefully. During the small overhaul in March, due to the workers' efforts to do a full-load (100% utilization of motor capacity) test, it was almost like a major overhaul, and the No. 4 motor was able to generate 1,500 kilowatts.

Secondly, in order to eliminate responsibility accidents, it is necessary to establish various work systems and regulations, and strictly implement the responsibility system. In the second quarter of this year, Fengshan, Tangshan and other power plants established operating and maintenance regulations and shift handover systems, so that workers clearly understood operating methods and work responsibilities. In order to strengthen the sense of responsibility and labor discipline of staff, some factories have also implemented a production self-inspection system in the sections or teams to correct various shortcomings in a timely manner. For example, the Tangshan boiler section corrected the tendency to pour too much water on the coal to save coal, which reduced the air pressure, thereby avoiding possible power outages.

Paying attention to improving workers' technical knowledge so that they are familiar with operating procedures is also an effective way to improve workers' responsible ability and overcome accidents. Several electricity units conducted accelerated business education in the first half of the year. Because the Fengshan Power Plant is particularly short of technical personnel, although accelerated business education could not take the form of classes, the method of combining tests and discussions was adopted, which also achieved the effect of improving technology.

The various methods adopted by Tangshan, Fengshan and other power plants to achieve safe production were carried out on the basis of mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses of workers. In addition to conducting more in-depth education on safe production, the Tangshan Power Plant administration and employees also signed a collective contract for safe power generation, which specifically stipulated the conditions that both parties should strictly abide by to achieve safe production. In the Fengshan Power Plant, a signature campaign was also conducted to strive for safe power generation, consolidating the workers' enthusiasm. This method has now been promoted. Shijingshan Power Plant and Qingdao Power Plant have also signed collective contracts one after another.

The ideological obstacle hindering the effective realization of safe power transmission and distribution is that many electricity personnel in various places believe that the technology is not reliable or that the equipment is not good, so they feel that responsibility accidents are inevitable, and they still dare not propose the slogan of eliminating responsibility accidents. However, the facts of the Fengshan Power Plant have made a completely opposite proof: the plant has a total of three machines, one of which is not frequently used and has a history of thirty or forty years; the one that is frequently used also has a history of more than ten years, and compared with other power plants, the plant's equipment conditions and the technical level of workers are not considered good. The reason why the plant has been able to avoid accidents for more than half a year and strive to avoid accidents throughout the year is that the importance attached to safe production by administrative staff and workers has played a very important role in their thinking.

### 做好机器检修工作  建立各种制度规程  凤山发电厂半年没出事故  其他电厂也创造了许多范例证明电业责任事故定能消灭

　　做好机器检修工作  建立各种制度规程
    凤山发电厂半年没出事故
    其他电厂也创造了许多范例证明电业责任事故定能消灭
    【新华社二十八日讯】如何消灭电业生产中的责任事故问题，半年来各地已创造了许多范例。石家庄电业局所属凤山发电厂半年多来没有发生事故；唐山电业局发电厂和天津电业局第一发电厂最近亦有两个多月做到安全发电。
    消灭责任事故的重要环节之一是做好机器检修工作。据统计：华北各电厂第二季发生的四十五次重要事故中，由于检修不良所造成的事故即占百分之五十三点三。有计划地定期地进行检修工作，是二月全国电业会议决定的今年度的重要工作之一。凤山发电厂今年以来均按月进行了检修，而且做得很仔细。该厂三月份进行小检修时，由于工人努力做全负荷（百分之百地发挥电机能力）试验，做得和大检修差不多，并使四号电机发足到一千五百千瓦。
    其次，为了消灭责任事故，必须建立各项工作制度和规程，严格实行负责制。今年第二季中，凤山、唐山等电厂曾建立了运行维护守则和交接班制度，因而使工人明确了解操作方法和工作职责。为加强工作人员的责任心和劳动纪律，有些厂在股或班中间还实行了生产的自我检查制度，及时纠正各种缺点。如唐山锅炉股纠正了为省煤而在煤上浇水过多使气压降低的偏向，从而避免了因此可能发生的停电事故。
    注意提高工人技术知识，使他们熟悉操作业务，也是提高工人负责能力，克服事故的有效办法。若干电业单位在上半年中曾进行了业务速成教育。凤山电厂因为技术人员特别缺乏，虽然业务速成教育不可能采取上课的形式，但采取测验和讨论相结合的办法，也收到提高技术的效果。
    唐山、凤山等电厂实现安全生产的各项办法，是在发动了工人群众的积极性的基础上进行的。除了较深入地进行关于安全生产的教育外，唐山发电厂行政与职工两方面并签订了安全发电的集体合同，具体规定了达到安全生产双方所应严格遵守的条件。在凤山发电厂亦进行了一次争取安全发电的签名运动，把工人的积极情绪巩固下来。这种方法，目前已被推广。石景山发电厂和青岛发电厂均已先后签订了集体合同。
    阻碍有效实现安全发送电的思想障碍，主要是各地电业人员中不少人认为技术没有把握或怪设备不好，因此感到责任事故不可避免，至今尚不敢提出消灭责任事故的口号。但凤山电厂的事实却做了完全相反的证明：该厂一共有三部机器，其中不经常开动的已有三、四十年的历史；经常开动的一部也有十多年历史，较之其他电厂，该厂设备条件和工人技术水平并不算好。该厂所以能做到半年多没有发生事故，并且争取全年不发生事故，行政人员和工人思想上对于安全生产的重视，是起了极重要作用的。
