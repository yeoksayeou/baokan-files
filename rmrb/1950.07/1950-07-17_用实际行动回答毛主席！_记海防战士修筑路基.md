　　"Answering Chairman Mao with Practical Action!"
　　A Record of Coastal Defense Soldiers Building Roadbeds
　　Along the railway line between Beijing and Shanhaiguan, from Haitan to Jinxi River, a distance of over ten kilometers, thousands of coastal defense soldiers are working intensely. Their task is to build stone embankments on both sides of the roadbed to prevent erosion from rain and seawater. At noon, the sun burns the earth like a flame, and the comrades' arms are tanned a dark, oily black, with streams of sweat running down their backs.

　　Trains heading north and south rumble past one after another, and passengers lean out of the windows, looking at them with surprised eyes.

　　Among the crowd, the most noticeable is a burly man with a dark complexion. The right knee of his trousers is already torn, and his shoulder is red and swollen. Every time he strikes a stone, his shoulder feels a sharp, stabbing pain. This is Yu Shifu, a Communist Party member and a soldier from the 2nd Battalion's Machine Gun Company.

　　It was half a month ago that the higher-ups gave the 2nd Machine Gun Company a crash assignment: to carry over one hundred and eighty cement telephone poles (each weighing 2,800 catties) to the railway line between Beicang and Jinxi River in just over ten days. Yu Shifu was taller than the others, making it even more difficult to carry. On the first day, his shoulder was pressed until it swelled more than three fingers high. On the second day, he gritted his teeth and continued working. The swollen shoulder was rubbed raw, then gradually flattened; then it swelled up again, and was flattened again. In addition, he was physically ill, and almost fainted once. The company cadres repeatedly told him to rest, but he said, "I won't rest until the task is completed!" He knew what his hard work would result in.

　　The comrades all knew him and had personally witnessed his spirit of sacrificing everything for the construction of the motherland. Everyone couldn't help but swing their hammers faster and work even more intensely. Patches of reeds on the roadbed slope were being removed, and large, uniform stones were being laid layer by layer.

　　The whistle blew, and the duty platoon leader shouted, "Rest, rest, have a smoke!" Everyone gathered together to talk about a recent major event.

　　"When we were building the new port, we wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, telling him that we would not only complete the task of defending the motherland's coast, but also strive to participate in national construction. The General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote back to us a few days ago! The letter said: It is hoped that we will continue to work hard and strive to the end for national construction..."

　　"It also said that Chairman Mao was very happy after reading our letter!"

　　"What an honor! Chairman Mao was very happy after reading our letter."

　　"We must work hard and use practical actions to respond to Chairman Mao's concern for us!" After Yu Shifu finished speaking, he stood up and went back to his work.

　　Yes, they are indeed answering Chairman Mao with practical actions. I have already discovered that there are more people among them with scars left by stones when building the new port on their legs and hands. Now, under the scorching sun, they are fighting tenaciously to restore and develop the country's transportation.

### “用实际行动回答毛主席！”  记海防战士修筑路基

　　“用实际行动回答毛主席！”
    记海防战士修筑路基
    北京至山海关线海滩至金溪河间十余公里的铁路两侧，正有数以千计的海防战士，紧张地工作着。他们的任务是要把路基两边的土坡筑成石坝，防止雨水和海水的冲刷。中午，太阳火焰似的烧着大地，同志们的臂膀，被晒得油黑发亮，一道道的汗水顺着脊背往下淌。
    北上和南下的火车，一列接一列从身旁隆隆地驰过，旅客从窗口探出头来，用惊奇的眼光看着他们。
    人群里，最引人注意的是一个黑大个，他的裤子右膝盖已经磨破了，肩头红肿了，每砸一下石头，肩膀就像小刀扎似地阵痛着；这是二营机炮连的战士，共产党员于世福。
    那是半月前，上级给了二机连一项突击任务，让他们把一百八十多根（每根重两千八百斤）洋灰电线杆子，在十多天中抬到北塘至金溪河的铁道沿线上。于世福比别人个子高，抬的时候更吃力，头一天就把肩膀压得肿起三指多高。第二天他咬着牙继续工作，肿起来的肩头磨破了，跟着又渐渐地被压平；再一次肿起，再一次被压平。加上身体有病，有一次差点晕过去。连干部几次叫他休息，他说：“不完成任务不休息！”他知道：自己的艰苦工作会换来什么结果。
    同志们都知道他，并且亲眼看见了他那种为建设祖国不惜牺牲个人一切的精神，大家不由得把锤子抡得更快，工作更加紧张。路基坡上的芦草一片片地被铲下去了，大块整齐的石头，一层层铺上来了。
    哨子响了，值星排长喊声：“休息休息，抽袋烟！”大家就围在一起谈着最近发生的一件大事。
    “修新港的时候，我们给毛主席写了信，告诉他：我们不但要完成保卫祖国海防的任务，还要努力参加国家建设。前两天中共中央办公厅写来回信啦！信上说：希望我们继续努力，为国家建设奋斗到底……”
    “还说毛主席看了我们的信很高兴呢！”
    “这是多么光荣的事啊！毛主席看了我们的信很高兴。”
    “我们可得好好努力工作，要用实际行动来回答毛主席对咱们的关心！”于世福说完这话，站起来又去干他的活了。
    是的，他们的确是在用实际行动回答着毛主席。我已发现他们中间有更多的人，腿上、手上带着在修筑新港时被石头碰破留下的伤痕，现在他们又在炎热的太阳下，为了恢复与发展国家的交通事业，顽强的战斗着。
