　　China Democratic National Construction Association Issues Written Statement
    Condemning Truman's Arrogant Ranting
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] A spokesperson for the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a written statement today, denouncing Truman's arrogant ranting on the 27th. The statement pointed out: This action by American imperialism proves, once again, a historical law: reactionary forces, on the eve of their demise, will exhibit even greater madness.

    The statement said: American imperialism is a paper tiger. The internal contradictions of the United States are very serious. An economic crisis is threatening the United States. Therefore, no matter to what extent the madness of American imperialism develops, the final victory will surely belong to the people of Asia and the people of the whole world.

    The statement claimed: The crazy aggression of American imperialism will make us more vigilant, more united, and work harder, with good preparation and full confidence to deal with yet another test. We call on national industrialists and business people across the country to work harder under the leadership of the state-owned economy to increase production and stabilize the market! Be vigilant at all times of enemy rumors and expose them!

    The statement concluded: We express our complete and unconditional trust and support for Chairman Mao's instructions and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people can overcome any difficulties, and no force can stop the Chinese people's efforts to unify the country and build a new nation.

　　民主建国会发表书面声明
    斥责杜鲁门狂妄叫嚣
    【新华社三十日讯】民主建国会发言人今日发表书面声明，斥责杜鲁门二十七日的狂妄叫嚣。声明指出：美帝国主义这一行动，又一次证明了一个历史的规律：反动势力在死亡的前夕，要格外表现出它的疯狂性。
    声明说：美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。美国的内部矛盾是十分严重的。经济危机正在威胁着美国。因而，不管美帝国主义的疯狂性发展到什么地步，最后的胜利一定属于亚洲的人民和全世界的人民。
    声明称：美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，将使我们更加警惕，更加团结，更加努力，以良好的准备和充分的信心去对付又一次的考验。我们号召全国的民族工商业家，要更好地在国营经济的领导之下，为增加生产，稳定市场而努力！要随时注意匪特的谣言而加以揭发！
    声明最后称：我们对于毛主席的指示和周外长的声明，表示完全的、无条件的信任和拥护。中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，任何的困难都是可以克服的，任何的力量都不能阻止中国人民统一全国、建设新国家的努力。
