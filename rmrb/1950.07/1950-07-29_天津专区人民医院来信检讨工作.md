To the Editor:

　　The criticism of our hospital's work by Comrade Ji Zhen published in the "People's Forum" on July 2nd was very helpful to our hospital's work. Here is an account of how we handled the situation.

　　First, we conducted a preliminary self-criticism at the leadership level. The main shortcomings were the failure to closely integrate political work, administrative leadership, and medical work. Individual patients harbored pessimistic sentiments about their conditions for a long time, but political work failed to address their problems in a timely manner, which affected treatment and peaceful recuperation. Some individual staff members were sloppy in their work, constantly making mistakes and errors, causing dissatisfaction among patients and the masses, and the administration also failed to conduct timely inspections and handle these issues. This shows that our hospital's leadership work was not thorough and practical enough, and that there was a serious bureaucratic and undesirable work style. Second, we conducted a review of past medical work and also discovered many shortcomings and serious errors that endangered lives. For example, Dr. Dai Qingwen often failed to record changes in the patient's condition on the medical record and wrote prescriptions without seeing the patient; sometimes he forgot to diagnose patients. This is clearly a manifestation of sloppy work. In terms of injections, inflammation and suppuration occurred in patients due to inadequate disinfection and carelessness. There were also many shortcomings and errors in nursing work. For example, patient Sun Xuewen, a surgical patient, was mistakenly given "Calcium Permanganate," causing severe vomiting. After Comrade Liu Shixing underwent a "hernia" operation, he was allowed to get out of bed to defecate on his own, causing the wound to rupture. Patient Li Suzhen had her upper limb amputated and was allowed to get out of bed to urinate on her own, causing her to fall. These incidents were all caused by the nurses' lack of a strong sense of responsibility. Although these are isolated incidents, they are indeed very serious problems. Many of those who come to the clinic for treatment are poor people, but some comrades put on airs and look down on them, often causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

　　The above is only our preliminary self-criticism. In the future, we will conduct a more in-depth and serious self-criticism and inspection in the Party rectification and cadre rectification work in order to improve our work.

### 天津专区人民医院来信检讨工作

　　天津专区人民医院来信检讨工作编辑同志：
    七月二日人民园地刊登了纪真同志对我院工作的批评。我们认为这对我院工作确有很大帮助。兹将我们处理情况告诉你们。
    首先，我们从领导上作了初步的检讨，其主要的缺点是政治工作、行政领导、医疗工作三者未能紧密结合。个别病员对自己的病情长期存在着悲观情绪，而政治工作未能及时解决他们的问题，便影响到治疗与安心静养；有的个别职员工作草率，不断发生缺点和错误，引起病员、群众的不满，而行政上也未能作到及时检查与处理。这说明我院领导工作不够深入切实，存在严重的官僚主义恶劣作风。其次，我们把过去的医疗工作作了一次检查，也发现不少缺点与险伤人命的严重错误。例如：医生戴庆文同志时常不在病历表上填写病情变化，不见病人就处方；有时对病员忘了诊断。这显然是工作马虎的表现。在注射方面，有因消毒不严，粗心大意，而使病人发生炎症及化脓。护理工作上，也存在不少缺点和错误。如给外科患者孙学文错服了“过门酸甲”，引起强烈呕吐。刘士型同志经“赫尔尼亚”手术后，让他自己下床大便，使伤口崩了线。病员李素珍上肢切断，让她自己下床小便而跌倒。这些事件皆因护理同志责任心不强而造成。虽说这是个别的现象，但也确是很严重的问题。来门诊治疗的多是贫苦群众，有个别同志却摆起架子，瞧不起他们，常引起群众不满。
    以上只是我们的初步检讨，今后我们还要在整党整干工作中更进一步深入认真的检讨与检查，以求工作的改进。
