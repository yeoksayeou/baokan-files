The central tasks of the conference are, according to Article 17 of the Common Program, "to abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people, to formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and to establish a people's judicial system," to seek unified views in the people's judicial work, establish systems, and resolve some issues that must and can be resolved.
