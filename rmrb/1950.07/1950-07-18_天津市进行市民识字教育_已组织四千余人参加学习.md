    Tianjin Carries Out Literacy Education for Citizens
    Over 4,000 People Have Participated in Learning

    [Our Newspaper Tianjin News] Since the beginning of April, Tianjin has focused on carrying out literacy education among the masses of citizens, planning to eliminate 10,000 illiterate people this year to create experience for the universal elimination of illiteracy in the future. In the past three months, 117 literacy classes have been organized throughout the city, with 4,451 students, of which women account for more than 90%.

    The literacy education work in various districts is generally led by the district offices and cultural centers, in coordination with relevant departments to organize the district literacy education committee; and it has absorbed people with prestige and enthusiasm for education among the masses to participate. Because the literacy movement is a new work, the city first conducted ideological mobilization among cadres in relevant departments. At the same time, it used big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, cartoons, radio lectures, seminars, mass meetings, theatrical performances, and other methods to carry out propaganda among the masses, so that everyone understood the significance of literacy education, to inspire the masses' consciousness of learning.

    The teachers for literacy education are mainly progressive intellectuals mobilized by the police stations and people with enthusiasm for education in the masses; secondly, the cultural centers, women's federations, district cultural and educational sections, etc., mobilize those within their systems who can teach to participate. Teachers are all unpaid. The classrooms for literacy classes mainly borrow classrooms from various schools, or use temples, ancestral halls, and other vacant houses. Most of the teaching aids are solved by relying on the masses. For example, when the Seventh Cultural Center held a literacy class in Qinghe Street, after the neighborhood chief's mobilization, it quickly borrowed houses, tables, chairs, blackboards, and other supplies; and with the assistance of the police station, it quickly hired volunteer teachers. The textbooks for literacy classes mostly use the textbooks for civil schools compiled by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. The curriculum focuses on literacy, supplemented by arithmetic, political common sense, and recreational activities. For example, the literacy classes in the Eighth District temporarily set seven hours of literacy per week, three hours of arithmetic, and two hours of political common sense; some arithmetic is only two hours, plus one hour of recreational activities. Class time is generally after 4 pm.

    According to the city's three months of work experience, to do a good job in literacy education, first, it is necessary to improve the leading organization, and according to the specific circumstances at that time and place, mobilize all possible forces, organize cadres of relevant departments, and absorb people in schools who are enthusiastic about literacy education or have experience in literacy education to participate in the district or street/neighborhood literacy education committee to promote the work. At the same time, there must be concrete leadership, in-depth inspection, more brainstorming, and solutions to difficulties. Second, it is necessary to establish learning organizations, improve the relationship between teachers and students; establish teaching and research associations to improve teachers' teaching ability and political awareness; establish various systems, organize mutual aid groups; and appropriately solve the difficulties of students in learning, such as women bringing children, to consolidate students' learning enthusiasm.

　　天津市进行市民识字教育
    已组织四千余人参加学习
    【本报天津讯】天津市从四月初起，有重点地开始了市民群众中的识字教育工作，预定要在本年内扫除一万文盲，为今后普遍性的扫除文盲工作创造经验。三个月来，全市已经组织了一百一十七个识字班，有学员四千四百五十一人，其中妇女占百分之九十以上。
    各区的识字教育工作，一般是以区公所、文化馆为主，配合有关部门组织区识字教育委员会来领导进行的；并吸收了群众中有威望和热心教育的人士参加。因为识字运动是一个新的工作，该市首先在有关部门的干部中进行了思想动员，同时利用大字报、黑板报、漫画、广播讲演、座谈、群众大会、演剧等方式，在群众中进行宣传，使大家明了识字教育的意义，以启发群众学习的自觉性。
    识字教育的教师主要由派出所动员进步的知识分子和聘请群众中热心教育的人士担任；其次由文化馆、妇联、区文教股等动员本系统内可能任课者参加。教师都是义务职。识字班的教室主要是借用各学校的教室，或利用庙宇、祠堂和其他空闲房屋。教学用具大多是依靠群众解决的。如第七文化馆在清和街举办识字班时，经过闾长的动员，很快就借到了房子、桌椅、黑板和其他用具；并由派出所协助，迅速地聘到了义务教员。识字班的教材大多采用中央人民政府教育部编的民校课本。课程以识字为主，辅助以算术、政治常识和文娱活动。如八区的识字班暂定每周识字七小时，算术三小时，政治常识二小时；有的算术只有二小时，另加一小时文娱活动。上课时间一般都是下午四时以后。
    根据该市三个月的工作经验，办好识字教育第一要健全领导机构，并根据当时当地的具体情况，动员一切可能动员的力量，组织有关部门的干部并吸收学校中热心识字教育或对识字教育有经验的人参加区或街、闾的识字教育委员会来推动工作。同时，要有具体领导，深入检查，多想办法，解决困难。第二，要建立学习组织，搞好师生关系；成立教学研究会，提高教师的教学能力和政治认识；建立各种制度，组织互助小组；并适当地解决学员在学习中的困难，如妇女带孩子等问题，以巩固学员的学习情绪。
