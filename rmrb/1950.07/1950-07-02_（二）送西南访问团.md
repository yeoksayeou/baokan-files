　　(II) Sending off the Southwest Visiting Group
    The Southwest Visiting Group dispatched by the Central People's Government is departing today. This visiting group represents the Central People's Government in extending greetings to the various fraternal ethnic groups in the Southwest region, with the mission of strengthening ties with the people of all ethnic groups and strengthening the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. We sincerely wish the visiting group, which bears this glorious mission, success.
    The people of all ethnic groups within our country have suffered deeply from the oppression of feudalism for thousands of years, the invasion of imperialism for over a hundred years, and the plunder of bureaucratic capitalism for nearly twenty years. In the years of imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule, the people of all ethnic groups universally suffered cruel enslavement and exploitation. The reactionary rulers of past dynasties, especially the reactionary rulers of the Han nationality, deliberately created discrimination and division among the ethnic groups to facilitate their oppressive rule, even to the point of eliminating minority ethnic groups. The reactionary rulers of the Han nationality committed many crimes against the minority ethnic groups in history, resorting to deceit, plunder, enslavement, and massacre, causing minority ethnic groups to be confined to remote mountainous areas. Their political, economic, and cultural lives remained in a backward state for a long time, and their populations gradually decreased.
    During the period of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule, Chiang Kai-shek, the reactionary ruler of the Han nationality, not only colluded with imperialism and all domestic reactionary forces to oppress the broad masses of the Han people, but also intensified the implementation of Han chauvinism, brutally oppressing the people of all minority ethnic groups within our country, even denying the existence of minority ethnic groups. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in his book "On Coalition Government": "The Kuomintang anti-people clique denies the existence of multiple nationalities in China and refers to the Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Yi, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups as 'clans.' They completely inherit the reactionary policies of the Manchu Qing government and the Northern Warlord government towards the minority ethnic groups, oppressing and exploiting them in every possible way."
    However, the situation has now undergone a fundamental change. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Han people have developed a historically unprecedented great revolutionary force, overthrowing the reactionary ruling clique of the Han nationality, enabling the Han and other ethnic groups to achieve liberation. This has ushered in a new era not only in Chinese history but also in the relations between the various ethnic groups within the country. The history of ethnic discrimination, oppression, and division is gone forever. The People's Republic of China has been founded, and we have a government that belongs to the people of all ethnic groups. This government is implementing correct ethnic policies. The Common Program stipulates: "All ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal. Unity and mutual assistance shall be practiced, and imperialism and the internal enemies of the people of all ethnic groups shall be opposed, so that the People's Republic of China becomes a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups. Great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism shall be opposed, and discrimination, oppression, and acts that split ethnic groups' unity shall be prohibited." Under the ethnic policies of this Common Program, we must declare an end to the history of Han oppression of minority ethnic groups. We must sweep away the crimes and historical misunderstandings created by the reactionary rulers of the Han nationality among the various ethnic groups in the country, so that the people of all ethnic groups can join hands closely and enter a big family of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation.
    The departure of the Southwest Visiting Group is a symbol of the genuine friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups in our country. The visiting group will represent the Central People's Government in extending deep sympathy to the people of all fraternal ethnic groups for the suffering they have endured in the past and soliciting their opinions on the implementation of various policies of the Central People's Government. The people of all fraternal ethnic groups should understand that we have now entered a new era in history, and that the people of all ethnic groups in the country must treat each other equally, help each other, and unite closely. To achieve ethnic equality, we need to make various efforts. Overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang only paved the way for ethnic equality; the backward political, economic, and cultural conditions of our ethnic groups caused by the history of reactionary rule still exist. This requires the people of all ethnic groups in our country to unite as one, work together, and develop the economic and cultural education of the masses of all ethnic groups. It is hoped that the work of the Southwest Visiting Group can help the Central People's Government make a good start in this regard.

### （二）送西南访问团

　　（二）送西南访问团
    中央人民政府派出的西南访问团，今天要出发了。这个访问团是代表中央人民政府，向西南地区各兄弟民族进行慰问；以加强与各兄弟民族人民的联系、加强国内各民族人民的团结为使命的。我们谨祝这个负有光荣使命的访问团的成功。
    我国境内各民族人民，曾饱受了数千年来封建主义的压迫、百余年来帝国主义的侵略和近二十余年来官僚资本主义的掠夺。在帝国主义和国民党反动统治的年月，各民族人民普遍遭受了残酷的奴役与剥削。历代反动的统治者，特别是汉族的反动统治者，有意地制造各民族间的歧视和分裂，以便利于他们的压迫统治，甚至于消灭少数民族。汉族的反动统治者在历史上对于各少数民族做了许多罪恶，欺诈、掠夺、奴役和屠杀，无所不至，使少数民族困居偏僻的山地，政治、经济和文化生活，长期处于落后状态，人口亦逐渐减少。
    在国民党反动派统治的时期，汉族的反动统治者蒋介石，不但勾结帝国主义和国内一切反动势力，压迫汉族的广大人民；而且变本加厉地实行大汉族主义，残暴压迫我国境内各少数民族的人民，甚至不承认少数民族的存在。正如毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”一书中所说：“国民党反人民集团否认中国有多民族存在，而把蒙、回、藏、彝、苗、瑶各少数民族称之为“宗族”。他们对于各少数民族，完全继承满清政府及北洋军阀政府的反动政策，压迫剥削，无所不至。”
    但是，现在的情形已经有根本的改变了。汉族人民在中国共产党的领导下，生长了历史上空前的伟大革命力量，打倒了汉族的反动统治集团，使汉族和其他各族人民都得到了解放。这不但在中国的历史上，而且在国内各民族的关系上，展开了一个新时代。过去民族歧视、压迫和分裂的历史从此一去不复返了。中华人民共和国成立了，我们有了属于各民族人民自己的政府。这个政府执行着正确的民族政策。共同纲领规定：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，禁止民族间的歧视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。”在这个共同纲领的民族政策之下，我们要把过去汉族压迫少数民族的历史宣告结束。我们要把过去汉族的反动统治者在国内各民族间所造下的罪恶和历史误解一扫而空，使各族人民从此亲密携手，走进团结互助、友爱合作的大家庭。
    西南访问团的出发，正是我国各民族真正友爱合作的一个象征。访问团将代表中央人民政府，对于各兄弟民族的人民在过去所遭受的痛苦，致以深切的慰问，并且征求他们对于中央人民政府各种政策实施的意见。应该使各兄弟民族的人民了解现在我们已经走进了历史的新时代，国内各民族人民必须平等互助、亲密团结。为了实现民族的平等，需要我们做种种的努力。把蒋介石匪帮打倒，还只是为民族平等开辟道路；过去反动统治历史所造成的我们民族的政治、经济和文化的落后状态仍然存在。这就要求我国各民族人民团结一致，共同努力，发展各民族人民大众的经济和文化教育事业。希望西南访问团的工作能帮助中央人民政府在这一方面作一个良好的开端。
