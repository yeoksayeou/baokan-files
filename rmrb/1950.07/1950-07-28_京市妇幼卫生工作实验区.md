Jing City Maternal and Child Health Work Experimental Zone
By our reporter Mu Yang

The poverty and backwardness caused by long-term reactionary rule brought terrible diseases and death to the broad masses of working women and their children. Take Section 7 of the former Tenth District (now the Seventh District) at Chongwenmen in Beijing as an example: 1,010 married women had given birth to a total of 3,494 children, of whom 1,482 died (i.e., 42.41 percent). These children mainly died from common infectious diseases such as measles, smallpox, diphtheria, as well as umbilical tetanus, and malnutrition after weaning. Nearly 300 of them died before they were a month old. Therefore, gradually changing this terrible situation has become an urgent task for the People's Government and other maternal and child health institutions.

Last September, at a symposium on maternal and child health jointly convened by the Municipal Women's Federation and the Municipal Public Health Bureau (then the Health Bureau), everyone clearly recognized that maternal and child health work should be oriented towards the working people. This district was selected as an experimental zone for maternal and child health, with a focus on conducting experiments to gain experience and launch a city-wide maternal and child health movement. At the end of October, with the help of the former North China People's Government Health Department, a working group of four people began work here.

For the first three months, the working group conducted door-to-door publicity and visits to investigate the living, occupational, and disease conditions of the local people. At the same time, they carried out prenatal check-ups, deliveries, postpartum visits, and outpatient services, and organized children's health check-ups and mothers' meetings to exchange childcare experience.

Initially, their work was very difficult. Many people thought they were checking houses, checking household registrations, or checking cleanliness; some old midwives spread rumors that they were "cutting the caul," frightening many women into hiding; some even locked their doors tightly and refused to let them in. However, the facts educated the masses: Li Xingyuan, a tricycle worker's wife, hid when the working group went to visit her before her first childbirth. When she was about to give birth, the baby was in the wrong position and she couldn't deliver for two days and two nights. Only then did she have to ask the comrades of the working group for help. The baby was born quickly, and both mother and child were safe. Cai Fan Hu Runshan's wife had her baby delivered by an old midwife. When the umbilical cord was cut, both mother and child were infected with bacteria. The child died of umbilical tetanus, and the adult contracted puerperal fever, which was cured by the working group. Many similar incidents enabled the working group to establish prestige among the masses, and the work gradually unfolded.

This situation brought new difficulties to the working group: By this time, although their medical staff had increased to five, they had to handle outpatient services, go out for deliveries, do check-ups, and carry out publicity work. They couldn't manage everything, and everyone was very busy, still being passive everywhere. "Should we focus on preventive work or treatment work?" This became a question they had to consider. Initially, the working comrades still seriously believed that "Publicity is useless. It's no use saying anything if you can't cure people's illnesses." This problem was resolved after the "March 8th" Maternal and Child Health Exhibition: When midwife Zhang Xiuzhen went to deliver Chen Yuchun's baby, she saw that she had boiled the scissors and thread with boiling water. Zhang Xiuzhen asked her how she knew these common sense practices, and she said she learned them from the exhibition. In addition, the number of deliveries performed by many private midwives doubled after the "March 8th" publicity. These facts made the comrades in the experimental zone deeply realize the effectiveness of publicity and education work. Therefore, while carrying out preventive medical work, they performed BCG tests on 4,500 children and vaccinated more than 1,400 children with BCG in April and May. At the same time, they vigorously carried out the following two tasks: First, organizing a maternal and child health work network: This is a work carried out throughout the city, and it is even more necessary in the maternal and child health experimental zone. They successively united all obstetricians and midwives in the district, and helped the midwives in the former Eighth District to organize two health work groups, which were directly led by the central group of the experimental zone, to conduct prenatal and postnatal visits, deliveries, and publicity, education, and investigation work. At the same time, they publicized the methods for reducing and exempting delivery fees for poor parturients, with the government subsidizing private midwives with 7.5 jin (half exemption) to 15 jin (full exemption) of millet for each delivery. Under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, private doctors and midwives serve the broad masses of working women and their children. In the two months after the implementation of this method, they have successively provided safe deliveries with reduced or free fees for 50 parturients. Second, vigorously organizing mothers' meetings: Before "March 8th," the working group organized mothers' meetings in Beishuiguan and achieved some results. Now, they pay more attention to this work. They have successively organized nearly a thousand women to participate in this organization and parent-teacher conferences of the same nature in Shangtangzi Hutong, Wofosi, Nianhuasi, barracks, Houheyan, Donghecao, and other places. At these meetings, the working group introduced the work of the Jing City Maternal and Child Health Work Network and the methods for reducing and exempting delivery fees for poor parturients and subsidies for difficult births to the mothers; invited midwives to systematically explain common sense of maternal and child health; and asked the mothers to introduce their childcare experiences to each other. These solved many difficult problems for the mothers. For example, women who used to think that having no children was "destined" are now actively coming to the experimental zone and the Second Health Center to check their health; people who used to think that "transverse and breech births" were "retribution for not doing good deeds in the previous life" are now coming to check the fetal position before delivery.

These achievements are not small. But despite these achievements, many children still die of umbilical tetanus and malnutrition. In this case, the working group must consider how to concentrate the existing manpower on mass health education and the work of uniting midwives and transforming old midwives. Recently, the working group has handed over all outpatient work to the Second Maternal and Child Health Center, introduced the delivery work to the health center and private midwives respectively, focused its work on publicity and prevention work, and prepared to further organize all active family members, unemployed young women, and old midwives in the district, teach them some maternal and child health knowledge, and then let them serve as health team leaders to deepen the work.

　　京市妇幼卫生工作实验区
    本报记者  穆扬
    长期的反动统治所造成的穷困与落后，带给广大劳动妇女和她们的孩子们以可怕的疾病和死亡。以北京市崇文门处原第十区（现为第七区）七段为例：一千零十名已婚妇女，共生养过三千四百九十四个孩子，而死亡的就占一千四百八十二名（即百分之四二·四一）。这些孩子主要是死于一般传染病症如麻疹、天花、白喉及脐带疯、断奶后营养失调等。其中近三百名是在未满月时就死掉的。因此，逐步改变这种恶劣的情况，就成为人民政府及其他妇幼卫生机构的迫切任务。
    去年九月，在市妇联与市公共卫生局（当时是卫生局）联合召集的妇婴卫生座谈会上，大家一致地明确认识了妇婴卫生工作应面向劳动人民的方向，并选定这段地区作为妇婴卫生实验区，首先作重点实验，以便吸取经验，展开全市妇婴卫生运动。十月底，在前华北人民政府卫生部的帮助下，一个由四人组成的工作小组，就在这里展开了工作。
    头三个月，工作组一面挨户进行宣传、访问，调查当地群众的生活、职业、和疾病情况，一面又进行产前检查、接生、产后访视及门诊工作，并举办儿单健康检查、组织母亲会交流育儿经验。
    最初，她们进行工作是很困难的。许多人认为她们是查房子、查户口或是查清洁的；某些旧接生婆造谣，说她们是“割紫合车（胎包）的”，吓的许多妇女都躲躲藏藏；有的更紧锁大门，不让她们进去。但是，事实教育了群众：三轮工人李兴源的老婆第一次生孩子，工作组去作产前访问时，她躲着不见。临产时，小孩的位置不正，两天两夜生不下来。这时才不得已把工作组的同志请去帮忙。孩子很快地生下来了，大人孩子都安全。菜贩胡润山的老婆生孩子是让旧接生婆接的，剪脐带时大人孩子都染了细菌，小孩得脐带疯死了；大人得了产褥热，还是工作组给她治好的。类似的许多事情，使工作组在群众中建立起威信，工作逐渐展开。
    这个情况又给工作组带来了新的困难：这时她们的医务人员虽已增加到五个人，可是又要门诊、又要外出接生、作检查、还要作宣传工作。顾了这就顾不了那，每个人都忙的不可开交，仍是处处被动。“以预防工作为主呢，还是以治疗工作为主呢？”这就成为她们必须考虑的问题。最初，在工作同志们的思想上，还严重地存在着：“宣传没什么用。不能给人家治好病说什么也是枉然”的想法。经过“三八”妇幼卫生展览，这个问题得到了解决：助产士张秀贞到陈玉春太太家接生时，看到她已经把剪刀、线都用开水煮过了。张秀贞问她怎样知道这些常识的，她说是从展览会上学来的。另外，许多开业助产士的接生数目，在“三八”宣传以后都增加了一倍。这些事实，使实验区的同志深深地体会到宣教工作的效力了。于是她们一面进行预防性的医疗工作，于四、五月份为四千五百儿童作卡芥苗试验，为一千四百余儿童接种卡芥苗。一面又大力开展了如下两个工作：一、组织妇幼保健工作网：这是一个在全市展开的工作，在妇幼卫生实验区就更加必要。他们先后团结了本区所有的产妇科医生、助产士，并帮助原八区的助产士，分别组织了两个保健工作组，由实验区任中心组直接领导，进行产前产后访问、接生以及宣教和调查工作。同时宣传对贫苦产妇接产的减免费办法，由政府津贴开业助产士，每接产一次给七斤半（半免）到十五斤（全免）小米。在公私两利的方针下使营业医生、助产士为广大劳动妇女及其幼儿服务。这个办法实施后的两个月里，她们已先后减免费为五十名产妇安全接生。二、大力组织母亲会：“三八”前，工作组曾在北水关组织过母亲会，收到了一些成果。现在，则更加重视了这项工作。她们先后在上堂子胡同、卧佛寺、捻花寺、营房、后河沿、东河槽等地组织了近千名妇女参加了这种组织，和相同性质的家长座谈会。在这些会上，工作组向母亲们介绍了京市妇幼保健工作网的工作和对贫苦产妇接产的减免费及难产补助办法；请助产士有系统地讲解妇幼卫生常识；并让母亲们彼此介绍育儿经验。这些，给母亲们解决了许多疑难问题。如过去认为没儿没女是“命”里注定的妇女，现在都主动地到实验区与第二保健所来检查病况；过去认为“横生倒养”是“上辈子没作好事的报应”的人，现在也在产前来检查胎位了。
    这些成绩是不小的。但尽管有这么些成绩，同时却仍有许多孩子死于脐带疯与营养失调。在这个情况下，工作组就必须考虑：怎样把现有的人力集中到群众性的卫生宣教和团结助产士、改造旧产婆的工作上去。最近工作组已将门诊工作全部交给第二妇幼保健所，把接产工作分别介绍给保健所和营业助产士，把自己的工作重点放在宣教预防工作上，并准备进一步地将全区积极分子家属、失业青年妇女及旧接生婆都组织起来，教给一些妇幼保健知识，然后再让她们分任保健组长，把工作深入下去。
