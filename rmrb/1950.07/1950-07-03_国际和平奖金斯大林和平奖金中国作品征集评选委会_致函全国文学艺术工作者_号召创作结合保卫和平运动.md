　　International Peace Prize Stalin Peace Prize Chinese Works Solicitation and Evaluation Committee
    Sends Letter to National Literary and Art Workers Calling for Creation Combined with the Movement to Defend Peace
    [This newspaper reports] The number of people who love peace around the world who have signed the peace declaration issued by the Third Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace has exceeded 140 million. According to preliminary statistics, the number in China has exceeded 27 million. At a time when the momentum of this peace is growing infinitely and powerfully, and the imperialist aggressor group is increasingly weakened and divided, the reactionary American President Truman openly announced that the US Army, Navy, and Air Force would participate in the war against the Korean people, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to obstruct our army from liberating Taiwan. This fully exposes the heinous attempt of the American imperialists to be enemies of all progressive and awakened people, and also shows the desperate struggle of the moribund imperialists!
    The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called on the people of the whole country to participate in the signature campaign to defend world peace, and designated July 1st to 7th as the Week of the Peace Signature Campaign. Our International Peace Prize, Stalin Peace Prize Chinese Works Solicitation and Evaluation Committee, in addition to expressing our warm support and active implementation of this call, would like to hope that our comrades, the literary and art workers of the whole country, will give full play to their high spirit of internationalism and patriotism in this great movement, and launch extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization to cities and villages, so that compatriots in every corner, every profession, every race, and every religious belief in the country will understand the meaning of signing, in order to set off an unprecedented upsurge in Asia defending world peace; hundreds of millions of glorious names will become "atomic bombs" to strike war mongers!
    Our signature campaign must be combined with the creative movement. We call on the literary and art workers of New China to create faster, more, and better works to defend world peace and enhance mutual understanding among the people of all countries, and to expose the heinous attempts of war mongers, in response to the International Peace Prize and Stalin Peace Prize solicitation movement. This is one of the important tasks in striving for lasting world peace, and we must do this work vigorously and contribute our greatest and best efforts!
    Compatriots, comrades, whether in Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, or Malaya, or in Japan in the future, the victory of the people is certain. The demise of the imperialist aggressors is also certain. In China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the great Chinese nation has already won a great historical victory over imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The unparalleled strength of the Chinese people has basically liberated the whole of China; no heinous efforts by American imperialism can prevent us from liberating Taiwan, which has been groaning under the internal and external reactionary rule for fifty years. The Asian national liberation movement is one wing of the movement to defend world peace, and this great tide is overwhelming and irresistible.
    Let the peace-loving people of the world unite more closely, taking the peace signature campaign as an opportunity, and strive to eliminate the deadly enemy of the progressive people, the American imperialists, and strive for lasting world peace!

    致函全国文学艺术工作者  号召创作结合保卫和平运动
    【本报讯】国际和平奖金、斯大林和平奖金中国作品征集评选委员会致函全国文学艺术工作者，号召把创作运动与保卫世界和平签名运动结合起来，以响应国际和平奖金与斯大林和平奖金征集运动。原函如下：全国文学艺术工作者同志：
    全世界爱好和平的人民在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次会议所发表的和平宣言上签名的已经超过一亿四千万了。在中国据初步统计也超过了二千七百万了。在这和平声势无限增长与强大，帝国主义侵略者集团日益削弱与分裂的时候，美国反动总统杜鲁门竟公然宣布美国陆海空军要参加对朝鲜人民作战，并命令美国第七舰队阻扰我大军解放台湾。这充分暴露了美国帝国主义者与一切进步觉醒人民为敌的罪恶企图，也显示了穷途末路的帝国主义者的绝望的挣扎！
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会号召全国人民参加保卫世界和平签名，并定七月一日至七日为和平签名运动周，我们国际和平奖金、斯大林和平奖金中国作品征集评选委员会除表示热烈拥护与积极执行这一号召外，谨希望全国文学艺术工作者同志们，在这一伟大运动中，发挥高度国际主义的爱国主义精神，向城市、乡村，展开广泛深入的宣传鼓动，使全国每一角落、每一职业、每一种族、每一宗教信仰的同胞都了然于签名的意义，以期在亚洲大陆掀起保卫世界和平的空前高潮；数以万万计的光辉名字将成为打击战争贩子的“原子弹”！
    我们的签名运动必须与创作运动相结合。我们号召新中国文艺工作者更快更多也更好地为保卫世界和平与增进各国人民间相互了解，揭发战争贩子罪恶企图而创作，以响应国际和平奖金与斯大林和平奖金应征运动。这是争取世界持久和平的重要工作之一，我们必须大力搞好这个工作，必须贡献我们最大最善的努力！
    同胞们，同志们，不管在朝鲜，在越南，在菲律宾，在马来亚，在将来的日本，人民的胜利是确定了的。帝国主义侵略者的灭亡也是确定了的。在中国，伟大的中华民族在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，已经对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义获得了伟大的历史胜利。中国人民的无比力量既已基本上解放了全中国；美帝国主义任何罪恶的努力也无法阻止我们解放五十年来呻吟在内外反动统治下的台湾。亚洲民族解放运动正是保卫世界和平运动的一翼，这一大潮排山倒海不可抗拒。
    全世界爱好和平的人民以和平签名运动为契机更紧密的团结起来，为消灭进步人民的死敌美国帝国主义者与争取世界持久和平而奋斗！
