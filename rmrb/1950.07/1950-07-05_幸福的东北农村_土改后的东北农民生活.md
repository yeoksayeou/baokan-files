　　Happy Northeast Countryside
　　——The Lives of Northeast Farmers After the Land Reform
　　Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Tian Liu
　　There was a farmer who used to work as a long-term laborer for a landlord, along with his brother and father. Although they toiled diligently for the landlord year after year, harvesting thousands of bushels of sorghum, soybeans, and other grains, making the landlord’s family fat and well-dressed, they themselves were constantly hungry. Their four younger sisters cried from hunger every day, and their mother, over fifty years old, couldn't afford cotton trousers to ward off the great cold winds of "outside the border" (Note 1). Now, this farmer has over three *qing* (Note 2) of his own land. Last year, he harvested twenty-one *shi* (Note 3) of grain, enough to feed his family of six until the autumn of next year. He also owns three oxen, three horses, and six quilts for his six family members. They now have cotton clothes for winter, light clothes for summer, and lined clothes for spring and autumn.

　　This farmer is named Sun Baifa, and he lives in Sihetun Village, Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province. This small village, like Sun Baifa, was poor during the Japanese occupation of Northeast China five years ago (1945). The entire village had seventy-two *qing* of land, with two landlord families occupying more than sixty-eight *qing*. Of the twenty-four draught animals, the landlords owned twenty. The twenty-six peasant households had only three *qing* of land and four draught animals. Although there were nearly ten thousand *qing* of fertile virgin land resembling oozing black oil near the village, "this also belongs to the landlord," and the poor were not allowed to cultivate it. Therefore, these honest and simple farmers either became tenants of the landlords or worked as long-term laborers for them.

　　Tenants had to hand over half of their entire harvest to the landlord each year. In addition, farmers had to take out 2.5 *shi* from the remaining half of their grain to give to the landlord as "master chef fee" (Note 4), and also pay the puppet Manchukuo's "shipment grain" for the landlord… If they were lucky enough to have a little left over after repaying the grain and seeds borrowed from the landlord in the spring at a 30% interest rate, they were considered fortunate. Then, the following spring, they would have to borrow grain and seeds from the landlord again, then cultivate the land again, ending up empty-handed once more. Tenants were thus tied to the landlord's land for life, becoming serfs unable to turn themselves around. Being a long-term laborer was even more bitter. The current village chief, Wang Zhentang, started herding pigs for the landlord at the age of eleven and became a long-term laborer at fifteen or sixteen, and had been one until 1945 - for a full thirty-two years. In the end, he hadn’t earned an acre of land, nor did he have a room of his own. His three children had no clothes to wear, and his wife wore the same tattered cloth shirt for twenty years. Sun Baifa and his father worked as long-term laborers for a landlord named Ding in the village in 1941. They didn't dare to enter their own door all year round, except when their family needed to mend their torn clothes. But at the end of the year, the landlord said that they had been absent from work too often, deducting all twelve *shi* of Sun Baifa’s wages and deducting ten *shi* of "shipment grain" from his father's wages. In this way, thirty *shi* of grain earned through a year of hard work were deducted by twenty-two *shi* for no reason! The landlord wasn't finished, and he forced him to repay the five *dou* of rice he borrowed the previous year, calculating the principal and interest to six *shi*. At that time, many landlords colluded with the government officials and local bandits. Any slight offense would result in being forced to provide grain, do "corvee labor" (serve as a soldier), or even face death. The father and son could only cry together. If they didn't repay, how could they dare? If they repaid, how would the family of eight survive the harsh winter? They could only beg bitterly, saying, "We will work for you again next year…" Once a person entered the landlord's gate to work, they could never think of escaping. They worked year after year, became indebted year after year, and forever became the landlord's cattle and horses. At that time, the peasants used the saying "Working as a long-term laborer requires no capital, but the more you work, the tighter the yoke becomes" to describe this inescapable fate of hired farmhands. Village chief Wang Zhentang said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government, I never dreamed I would have this day!"

　　What is the life of the farmers in Sihetun Village like today?

　　Sun Baifa's family, as said before, is living a beautiful life. Let's look at the family of the hired farmhand Wang Jingchun. His family of seven, like Sun Baifa, was desperately poor, having nothing. In 1947, during the land reform, they were allocated more than two *qing* of land and one horse. In the past two years, they have actively engaged in production and reclaimed wasteland, and now cultivate four *qing* of land, and have four horses and two oxen. Poor peasant Yu Changjiang already has three horses and two oxen. Wang Zhentang, who had worked for the landlord for thirty-two years, now has more than three *qing* of land, four horses, and nine oxen. The grain he harvested in 1948 lasted until June of this year. Now, this small village of thirty-two households (one household moved away after liberation and five moved in) with one hundred and seventy-seven people has fifty-seven horses and thirty oxen, more than two and a half times the twenty-four draught animals at the time of the land reform in 1947. In 1948, the village produced 470 *shi* of grain, an increase of more than one and a half times from the 179 *shi* in 1947, and also an increase of 60% over the puppet Manchukuo's highest annual output of 300 *shi*. In the past these grains would be seized by the landlords during the Chinese New Year, but today they all belong to the farmers themselves. Now, almost every household in the village has surplus grain, and at least lives a life of adequate food and clothing. Only three households in the village still do not have horses. One household is the former landlord. Although he was allocated the same amount of land as the peasants during the land reform, he still did not work hard in the first two years, so his life has improved slowly. The other two households are immigrants who moved to the village less than half a year ago.

　　After the liberation of Northeast China in 1945, the Party and the People's Government led the peasants to implement land reform in 1947, distributing the landlords' land to landless and land-poor peasants. Subsequently, they led the emancipated peasants to organize labor exchange and mutual aid to actively engage in production. Wang Zhentang, Yu Changjiang, and other activists in the land reform responded to the Party's call, organized labor exchange groups, worked hard in production, and became production models. In the autumn, some of them harvested crops, while others gathered firewood and engaged in sideline production. In the winter, the village earned 38 million yuan from gathering firewood alone. With this money, they bought two carts, three horses, fifteen *shi* of grain, five thousand *jin* of cabbage, and each member of the labor exchange group also received 150,000 yuan. The masses understood the benefits of the labor exchange group, and more people participated the following year. In the summer, Wang Zhentang, Yu Changjiang, and more than ten other awakened poor and hired farmhands gloriously joined the Communist Party. From then on, the connection between the masses and the Party became closer, the Party's leadership over the masses became stronger, the masses' enthusiasm for production became higher, and labor exchange and mutual aid were organized better. Now, all twenty-nine male laborers in the village are organized into three labor exchange groups. Manpower and animal power are all assigned "points" according to labor capacity, and in the future, work will be recorded according to work points, and work will be distributed according to points. The women and children of the entire village, like their husbands and fathers, enthusiastically participated in the intense labor of creating a better life. Twenty-nine young and middle-aged women were organized together. In addition to participating in weeding and hoeing, they also gathered firewood, picked mushrooms, and cut *wula* grass. Last year, each woman received six or seven *dou* of grain and 1.5 million yuan. Almost every woman bought two or three sets of her favorite new clothes, and many women used the money and grain they earned to subsidize family production. Women's Federation Director Zhang Shuzhen (a Party member) and her brother's wife jointly bought a large cow with the money they earned from production; Wang Zhentang's wife and her eldest son (seventeen years old) also bought one together, further increasing the family's production power.

　　Because the men and women of Sihetun Village all worked hard and actively engaged in labor, with more manpower, the land was cultivated more carefully than in the past. Therefore, the land harvest increased year by year: In 1947, each *qing* produced 1,260 *jin* of grain, and last year it reached 2,400 *jin*, an increase of nearly one time, exceeding the highest standard of 2,100 *jin* per *qing* during the puppet Manchukuo era. Because the village's labor exchange and mutual aid were well organized, and productivity was greatly improved, they had abundant labor, so they actively reclaimed wasteland, and the cultivated land area increased year by year. Fifteen *qing* of wasteland were reclaimed in 1948, nineteen *qing* last year, and sixty-seven *qing* are planned to be reclaimed this year. Later, because the Northeast People's Government lent the village two sets (thirteen machines each) of Soviet horse-drawn farm implements, production efficiency became even higher. In reality, 114 *qing* of wasteland were reclaimed, almost doubling the original plan. This year, the village can harvest at least 900 *shi* of grain, three times the highest output of 300 *shi* during the puppet Manchukuo era, an average of more than five *shi* per person for the entire village of one hundred and seventy-seven people.

　　Farmers rely on grain. When the grain harvest is high, everything gets better.

　　Originally, this small village was a "blind village," with almost no one literate. Now, this village has its own school. The tallest and most beautiful house in the village is the school's classroom. "We can't let the children be blind too!" The farmers, liberated from the shackles of the feudal land system and enriched by hard work, raised funds last spring to build this spacious and bright classroom and purchased all the desks and chairs. So, this "blind village" saw the light for the first time and had its own school for the first time. Children over the age of six are all enrolled in school, and even seventeen- and eighteen-year-old girls are enrolled in school to study in the same grade with six- and seven-year-old children, reading the same books. A small village with only one hundred and seventy-seven people has as many as forty-seven children enrolled in school. If you add the nearly sixty adult "students" in the literacy class (including fifty-two-year-old old men and forty-year-old old ladies), more than half of the village is enrolled in school. The classroom is decorated beautifully, with the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, whom the children say "loves us the most," colorful pictures, and the children's own wall newspapers and "challenge columns." The children are living their happy school lives here. Next to Chairman Mao's portrait, there is a painting titled "Whoever Studies Well, Will See Chairman Mao First," in which a child holding a red flag is advancing rapidly on the road to Chairman Mao. Ma Xirong, a second-grade student, published his challenge in the "challenge column," writing: "I challenge Xie Youqin - because we laugh too much. I laugh in class, and so do you. Not good. I will definitely change this week, please accept the challenge!" (Punctuation added by me.) Living in a time of laughter, they laugh even in class. Liu Zhenqin, a first-grade student, drew a picture and posted it on the wall newspaper, depicting a hen leading a group of chicks. Perhaps she thought that the chicken would be more beautiful this way, she used red and blue pencils to paint the hen's feathers like her own floral clothes, and the chicks were as red as a ball of fire.

　　Wang Zhentang, the old hired farmhand of thirty-two years and now the village chief, loves his eleven-year-old son the most. Whenever he eats, old Wang holds up a bowl full of golden corn porridge and sorghum rice that resembles plum blossoms, always thinking of the suffering he endured in the past. He can't help but pat his child's head: "Your generation is blessed!" The child disagrees: "Your generation isn't blessed?" But Wang Zhentang still insists: "Anyway, the children are happier than us!"

　　(Note 1) "Outside the border" is the name given by the people of Zhaoyuan and surrounding areas to the area north of the Songhua River in northern Manchuria.

　　(Note 2) "Qing" is a unit of measurement of land area in northern Manchuria. The area is 10,000 square meters, which is the common "hectare," equivalent to about 240 square *bu*, or 15 *mu* in the interior.

　　(Note 3) "Shi" - each *shi* is 500 *jin*.

　　(Note 4) In the past, most tenants ate in the landlord's house, which was called "*Pang Liqing*" in the Northeast. Each year, the tenant had to pay 2.5 *shi* of food expenses, which in some places was called the "master chef fee."

　　幸福的东北农村
    ——土改后的东北农民生活
    本报特派记者  田流
    有一个农民，早先同他的弟弟和父亲三个人都给地主作长工。虽然他们一年又一年地为地主辛勤劳动，替地主收获了成千百石的高粱、大豆和许多别的粮食，使地主家大人孩子都吃得肥肥胖胖，穿的美丽漂亮，可是他们自己却整年吃不饱肚子，四个小妹妹整天饿得哇哇地哭，五十多岁的母亲，冬天都穿不上一条棉裤，挡一挡“边外”（注一）的大风寒。现在这个农民有了自己的三垧（注二）多地，去年收粮二十一石（注三），一家六口人能吃到明年秋天。还有三头牛，三匹马，六口人六床被，已经是冬穿棉衣夏穿单，春秋都有夹衣穿的人家了。
    这个农民叫孙柏发，家住黑龙江省肇源县四合屯。这个小村庄在五年前（一九四五年）日寇侵占东北期间，就和孙柏发一样穷。全村有七十二垧地，两家地主倒占去了六十八垧多；二十四头耕畜，地主占有二十头。二十六户农民只有三垧多地和四头耕畜。虽说村边有近万垧像冒着黑油似的肥沃的处女地，但“这也是地主的”，不让穷人开垦。因此，这些忠厚淳朴的农民，不是变成了地主的佃户，就是作了地主的长工。
    佃户每年要将全部收获物的一半交给地主，另外农民还需从自己剩下的一半粮食中拿出二石五斗交给地主，作“大师傅费”（注四），还要替地主交纳伪满的“出荷粮”……。侥幸剩下一点点，偿还了春天种地时三分利向地主借的口粮、种籽等，落个一干二净，还算是运气好的。于是他们第二年春天又要向地主借口粮、种籽，然后再种地，再闹个两手空。佃户就这样终生被拴在地主的土地上，成了不得翻身的农奴。当长工就更苦了。现在当了村长的王振堂从十一岁就给地主放猪，十五、六岁就给地主当长工，一直到一九四五年，整整三十二年，到头来田地没赚下一亩，房屋也没有自家的一间，三个孩子穿不上衣服，老婆二十年总穿着那一件破布衫。孙柏发和他的父亲，一九四一年同时给本村丁姓地主当长工，一年到头除了需要家里人缝补破衣裳的时候，没敢入过自家门。可是年终一算账，地主说他们旷工太多，把孙柏发十二石工资都扣光，又在他父亲工资中扣了十石“出荷粮”。这样，一年辛辛苦苦挣来的三十石粮，无缘无故被扣去了二十二石！地主还不算完，又逼着他偿还头年借的五斗米，连本带利算成六石。那时节不少地主一手拉住官厅，一手勾着胡子（土匪），稍有冒犯，不是叫你出粮、“俸仕”（当壮丁），就会有杀身的灾难。父子俩只有抱头痛哭。不偿还吧，——那又怎么敢？偿还吧——一家八口就熬不过酷寒的冬天。只好苦苦哀求，说“明年再给你佬作工……”。给地主作工的人，一入地主大门，就再也不用想脱身了，年年作工，年年负债，永远成了地主的牛马。当时农民用“作长工，不用本，越作越枷紧。”一语，形容这不得解脱的雇农命运。村长王振堂说：“要不是共产党、人民政府来啊，作梦也没想到有今天！”
    今天四合屯村农民的生活怎样了呢？
    孙柏发家不用再说了，小日子是过得那么美。看另一家雇农王景春家吧，一家七口，原先像孙柏发一样，穷的啥也没有；一九四七年土地改革分到了两垧多地，一匹马，二年来积极生产又开荒，已种上四垧地，有了四匹马，两头牛。贫农于长江已经有三匹马，两头牛。给地主扛了三十二年活的王振堂，现在有了三垧多地，四匹马，九头牛，一九四八年收获的粮食吃到今年六月还没完。现在这个三十二户（解放后迁走一户，移来五户）一百七十七口人的小村庄有五十七匹马，三十头牛，比一九四七年土改时的二十四头增加两倍半以上。一九四八年全村产粮四百七十石，比一九四七年的一百七十九石增加一倍半以上，比伪满三百石的最高年产量还提高了百分之六十，去年又创造了五百一十石的新纪录。过年这些粮食都要被地主夺去，而今天都是农民自己的了。如今全村人几乎家家户户都有余粮，至少也过着足衣足食的生活。全村只有三户还没有马。一户是原来的地主，土改时虽和农民分得了同样的一份地，但头二年他仍不好好劳动，所以生活上升得慢。另两户是搬到本村还不到半年的移民。
    一九四五年东北解放后，党和人民政府领导农民于一九四七年实行了土地改革，将地主的土地分配给无地少地的农民，随即又领导翻身农民组织换工互助，积极生产。王振堂、于长江等土改中的积极分子，首先响应党的号召，组织换工组，努力生产，又成了生产模范。秋天他们一部分人收获，一部分人打柴闹副业生产。到了冬天，全村光打柴就获利三千八百万元，用这笔钱买了两辆大车，三匹马，十五石粮食，五千斤白菜，每个参加换工组的人还分了十五万块钱。群众了解了换工组的好处，第二年参加的就更多了。夏天，王振堂、于长江等十多名觉悟的贫、雇农，又光荣地参加了共产党。从此群众同党的联系更密切了，党对群众的领导更加强了，群众生产的积极性更加高涨，换工互助也组织得更好了。现在全村二十九个男劳动力分别组织在三个换工组里。人力、畜力都按劳动力定成“分”，将来按工记分，按分齐工。全村的妇女、儿童也像他们的丈夫、父亲一样，热烈地参加了创造美好生活的紧张劳动。二十九个青、壮年妇女组织在一起，除了参加锄田、拔草等工作外，她们还打柴、检蘑菇、割乌拉草等。去年每个妇女分得六、七斗粮食，和一百五十万块钱。妇女们差不多每人都买了两、三套自己喜爱的新衣裳，更有不少的妇女将自己劳动所得的钱、粮食等补助家庭生产。妇联主任张淑珍（党员）和她的兄弟媳妇用自己生产的钱合买了一头大母牛；王振堂的妻子和她的大儿子（十七岁）也合买了一头，更增加了全家的生产力量。
    由于四合屯村男男女女都努力生产、积极劳动，人手多了，土地耕作得也比过去细致了。因此，土地收获量年年增加：一九四七年每垧产粮一千二百六十斤，去年已达二千四百斤，提高将及一倍，已超过伪满时代每垧产粮二千一百斤的最高标准。由于该村换工互助组织得好，生产力有很大的提高，有了富裕的劳动力，他们便积极开荒，耕地面积也就年年增加起来。一九四八年开荒十五垧，去年十九垧，今年计划开六十七垧。后来又因为东北人民政府贷给了该村两套（每套十三台）苏联马拉农具，生产效率更高了，实际开荒一百一十四垧，几乎超过原计划一倍。今年该村最少能收粮九百石，等于伪满最高三百石产量的三倍，全村一百七十七口人，每人平均五石多。
    庄稼人靠粮食。粮食收的多，一切都好起来了。
    原先这个小村庄是个“瞎子村”，简直没有识字的。现在这个村庄已有自己的学校了。村中那所最高大最漂亮的房子便是学校的教室。“再不能让孩子们也当瞎子了！”从封建的土地制度束缚中解放出来的农民，从辛勤劳动中富裕起来了的农民，去年春天集资兴建起这所宽大明亮的教室，并购置了全部桌凳。于是这“瞎子村”第一次看见了光明，破天荒地有了自己的学校。六岁以上的儿童都入学了，连十七、八岁的姑娘也入校学习，同六、七岁的孩子在一个年级，念同样的书。仅仅一百七十七口人的小村庄，竟有四十七个儿童入学读书。如果加上识字班近六十个成年“学生”（有五十二岁的老头子和四十多岁的老太太），全村一半以上的人都入学读书了。教室布置得很漂亮，有孩子们说的“最爱我们的”毛主席巨像，有五彩的图画，也有孩子们自己的墙报和“挑战栏”。孩子们就在这里过着他们快乐的学习生活。在毛主席挂像的旁边，有一幅题名“谁学习得好，谁先见毛主席”的画上，一个手执红旗的孩子，正在朝向毛主席的那条大路上迅速前进。二年级学生马希荣在“挑战栏”里发表了他的挑战书，上面写道：“我和谢有琴挑战——因为爱笑挑战。我上课爱笑，你也是。不好。这星期我准改，请你应战！”（标点是我加的）生活在欢笑的时代，上课时他们也欢笑起来了。一年级小同学刘贞琴画了一幅画贴在墙报上，画的是一只母鸡领着一群小鸡。大概是她觉得鸡生得这样更美丽吧，她用红蓝铅笔把母鸡的羽毛画成了像自己穿的花条衣裳，小鸡红得像一团火。
    三十二年的老雇农、如今的村长王振堂最喜欢他的十一岁的小儿子。每逢吃饭，老王端起满碗金黄的苞米粥和梅花似的高粱米饭，总想起过去自己受苦的日子，他便不由自主地拍拍孩子的头：“你这一代有福了！”孩子不服气：“你这一代没福？”但王振堂仍然坚持着：“反正孩子们比咱们更幸福！”
