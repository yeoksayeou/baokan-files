　　Hainan Island Launches Summer Epidemic Prevention
    Haikou City Inoculates Eighty Percent of Population Against Cholera
    [Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 8th] Since liberation, Haikou City has actively launched summer epidemic prevention work. The anti-cholera inoculation work has now concluded. In the span of three weeks, over 84,000 citizens have been inoculated, accounting for more than 80% of the city's population. To improve public health, the Municipal People's Government Health Department has convened health work meetings in recent days to discuss cleaning up garbage and excrement, dredging ditches and canals, controlling water sources, and regulating vendors selling raw and cold food.
    Health work is also gradually being carried out across the island. Health institutions in seventeen counties have begun to be established. The Hainan Military and Political Committee has distributed a large number of cholera vaccines to the Li and Miao Autonomous Region and various counties to enable them to carry out widespread preventive inoculation work.

    【新华社海口八日电】解放后的海口市积极展开夏季防疫工作。现防止霍乱的注射工作已告结束。在三个星期的时间内，已有八万四千余市民经过注射，占全市人口百分之八十以上。市人民政府卫生科为改善公共卫生环境，连日来召集卫生工作会议，讨论清理垃圾、粪便和疏浚沟渠、管制水源、生冷饮食摊贩等工作。
    全岛卫生工作亦在逐步开展。十七个县的卫生机构已着手建立。海南军政委员会已发给黎、苗民族自治区及各县大量霍乱疫苗，以便各县进行普遍的预防注射工作。
