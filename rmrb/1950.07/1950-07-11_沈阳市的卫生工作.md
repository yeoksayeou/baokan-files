Shenyang City's Public Health Work
By Our Correspondent Sun Yusheng

Following the principle of "prevention first, treatment secondary," Shenyang City has achieved some progress in public health work in the past six months. On the one hand, the city has united the majority of private medical personnel, established a "responsibility physician system," carried out patient education, and strengthened epidemic prevention work. On the other hand, improvements have been made in urban sanitation management and cleaning.

Uniting Private Medical Personnel

Shenyang City has a population of 1.6 million. In addition to public medical institutions, there are 414 private Western medicine practitioners, 536 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, 196 veterinarians, 546 midwives, and 48 pharmacists, totaling 1,740 people. To unite this force to assist the government in public health work, the city's main approach is to organize medical personnel for study and help them solve some necessary and solvable problems. In 1949, the city held political training classes, organizing 326 medical personnel and 80 veterinarians to study for more than 30 days, raising the political awareness of medical personnel. After the study, 90 people participated in government work. Since this year, under the principle of private operation with public assistance, 1,590 various medical personnel throughout the city have been organized into amateur schools for study according to their categories. The government helped them solve the difficulties of school buildings and teachers. At the same time, the government encouraged them to organize joint hospitals and maternal and child health stations, helping them solve the problem of 20 houses and lending them 350 million yuan in start-up funds. This greatly encouraged the working enthusiasm of private doctors. This year, on the "May 12" International Nurses Day, the government rewarded 11 exemplary medical workers who assisted the government, commended 15 excellent medical workers, and organized medical personnel from public and private hospitals throughout the city to go to Beiling for a "picnic." The Health Bureau also invited the heads of various medical personnel associations and exemplary medical workers to hold a dinner and symposium. These all contributed to the unity of medical personnel throughout the city.

Establishing a "Responsibility Physician System"

Relying on various private medical personnel throughout the city, Shenyang City established a "responsibility physician system." The city organized 1,233 medical personnel and divided them into 128 responsibility groups according to streets. They carried out mass health propaganda and education work, organized residents to hold health lectures, made home visits, and carried out epidemic prevention and quarantine work. From January to April this year, responsibility physicians throughout the city conducted 13,200 mass health education sessions, with an audience of 440,000 people; and made home visits to 155,000 households. This spring, the city completed the vaccination of 800,000 people, mainly relying on the responsibility physicians to organize vaccination stations to complete it. In terms of epidemic prevention and quarantine, the health offices of each district, under the leadership of the responsibility physicians, carried out the "digging out disease roots" method of eliminating epidemics. Responsibility physicians have become the main force in the city's health, epidemic prevention, and health care work.

In addition, medical personnel throughout the city assisted the government in carrying out a number of epidemic prevention, health checkups, and health propaganda work. The city's 493 Chinese and Western medicine clinics have implemented free treatment for poor citizens, with each clinic providing free treatment to an average of five people per month. This year's Spring Festival, the Physicians Association responded to the government's call to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers during the Spring Festival, issuing a total of 5,000 free treatment coupons (each coupon for one person's treatment until cured). In addition, in terms of preventing livestock epidemics, the city mobilized 64 veterinarians and completed preventive injections for more than 50,000 heads of livestock and poultry. In five months, the cumulative number of medical personnel who voluntarily participated in the above-mentioned work reached 4,637, saving the government 18 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in wages and medical expenses.

Carrying Out Patient Education

Since February, hospitals and health offices have changed the past practice of focusing on treatment and waiting for patients at home, and have carried out patient education, and through patients to educate the masses. Each hospital sends a certain number of medical staff to specialize in this work every day; each health office has also established epidemic prevention and health care rooms, with nearly half of the staff doing prevention work. For example, educating waiting patients on the prevention of seasonal diseases; educating patients when they are admitted to and discharged from the hospital; after patients return home from the hospital, the health office assists them in holding resident symposiums to publicize the causes of their illness and the process of infection; and setting up comic strips in the waiting room for epidemic prevention education. Due to the development of patient education and other health propaganda and education, the masses' understanding of hospitals and health offices has been improved, and the number of people going to hospitals for examination and treatment has increased month by month. The city's four hospitals and eight district health offices treated 10,004 outpatients in January, and the number increased month by month, reaching more than 16,000 in May.

Improving Sanitation Management Work

In terms of urban sanitation management, Shenyang City carries out through two organizational forms: improving the organization of cleaning teams and establishing mass-based grassroots health organizations. In terms of cleaning teams, the education of team members has been strengthened to improve their political awareness; at the same time, a section-based responsibility system has been implemented, and each person is responsible for cleaning a section of the main road through democratic discussions among team members. In the past six months, the city's cleaning road area has increased by 76% compared with last year; the average cleaning area per cleaner per day has also increased from 3,000 square meters last year to 3,500 square meters.

In terms of mass health organizations, the city has established district health and epidemic prevention committees, resident group health committee members, and health committees in various health industries. The government has formulated regulations for various grassroots health organizations, and the masses have also formulated health covenants. The health committee members have all undergone short-term training, and they can generally actively carry out health propaganda, education, and organization work among the masses, and compete with each other to become models. They have played a decisive role in every cleaning campaign. The government also gives appropriate commendations and rewards on time. Relying on the broad masses, the city has cleared a total of more than 550,000 tons of accumulated and newly generated garbage since the puppet Manchurian regime in the spring and autumn seasons of last year and the spring of this year; and cleared 57,000 cubic meters of accumulated snow in winter.

　　沈阳市的卫生工作
    本报通讯员  孙雨生
    根据“预防为主、医疗为辅”的方针，沈阳市半年来的卫生工作获得了一些成绩。一方面，该市团结了广大开业医务人员，创建了“责任医师制”，开展了病人教育，加强了防疫工作。另一方面，对城市卫生管理和清扫工作已有改进。
            团结开业医务人员
    沈阳市有人口一百六十万。除公立医疗机关外，私人开业西医有四一四名，中医五三六名，兽医一九六名，助产士五四六名，药剂师四八名。总计一、七四○名。为了团结这批力量协助政府进行卫生工作，该市采取的办法主要是组织医务人员学习，并帮助他们解决一些需要而可能解决的问题。一九四九年，该市分别举办政治训练班，组织了三二六名医务人员和八○名兽医各学习三十多天，提高了医务人员的政治觉悟。经过学习之后，即有九十人参加了政府工作。本年以来，在私办公助的原则下，全市一、五九○名各种医务人员按类组织了业余学校进行学习。政府帮助他们解决了校舍及师资的困难。同时，政府并鼓励他们组织联合医院和妇婴卫生站，帮助他们解决了房舍二十处，并贷给开办资金三亿五千万元。这样，大大地鼓舞了私医的工作情绪。今年“五一二”国际医务节日，政府又奖励了协助政府工作的模范医务工作者十一名，表扬了优良的医务工作者十五名，并组织全市公私医院的医务人员赴北陵“野游”，卫生局又邀请各医务人员公会负责人和模范医务工作者举行聚餐和座谈会。这些，都有助于全市医务人员的团结。
            建立“责任医师制”
    依靠全市各种开业医务人员，沈阳市创建了“责任医师制”。该市共组织医务人员一、二三三人，按街道分编了一二八个责任组。分别展开群众性的卫生宣传教育工作，组织居民举办卫生讲演，家庭访问，并进行防疫检疫等工作。自今年一月至四月，全市责任医师共进行了群众卫生教育一万三千二百次，听众达四十四万人；并赴十五万五千户作了家庭访问。本年的春季该市完成八十万人的种痘工作，主要也是依靠责任医师，组织种痘站完成的。在防疫检疫方面，各区卫生事务所领导责任医师，开展了“挖病根”灭疫方法。责任医师已成为全市卫生防疫保健工作的主要力量。
    此外，全市医务人员并协助政府进行了多项防疫、健康检查、卫生宣传等工作。全市中西医诊疗所四九三处，并实行了给贫苦市民的免费治疗，每所每月平均免费治疗五人。今年春节，医师公会为响应政府春节拥军优属号召，共送发了免费施疗券五千张（每张为一人治病至治愈为止）。另外，在预防畜疫方面，该市共发动了兽医六十四名，完成了家畜、家禽五万余头的预防注射。五个月中，义务参加上述各项工作的医务人员前后累计达四千六百三十七名，为政府节省了工薪医药费用达一百八十亿元（东北币）之巨。
            开展病人教育
    各医院和卫生事务所，自二月份起，改变了过去偏重治疗，坐在家里等病人的办法，开展了病人教育，并通过病人来教育群众。各医院每日派一定的医护人员专作此一工作；各卫生事务所并建立防疫保健室，有将近二分之一的人员作预防工作。如对候诊病人进行季节性疾病预防的教育；对病人出入院时的教育；病人退院回家后，并由卫生事务所协助其召开居民座谈会，宣传他患病原因及传染经过等；另外在候诊室装设连环图画等进行防疫教育。由于病人教育与其他卫生宣传教育的开展，提高了群众对医院与卫生事务所的认识，到医院检查、就诊的人数逐月增加。全市四个医院和八个区卫生事务所，一月份门诊者为一万零四人，以后逐月增加，到五月已增至一万六千人以上。
            改进卫生管理工作
    在城市卫生管理方面，沈阳市通过两种组织形式来进行：健全清洁队的组织和建立群众基层卫生组织。在清洁队方面，加强了队员的教育，提高其政治觉悟；同时实行分段负责办法，通过队员民主讨论，每人负责清扫一段主要马路。半年来，该市清扫道路面积比去年增加了百分之七十六；清洁队员每人每日的平均清扫面积也由去年的三千平方公尺提高到三千五百平方公尺。
    在群众卫生组织方面，该市建立了区卫生防疫委员会，居民组卫生委员和各卫生行业的卫生委员会。政府制订了各种卫生基层组织的条例，群众也分别订立了卫生公约。各卫生委员都经过了短期训练，他们一般都能在群众中积极进行卫生宣传、教育和组织工作，并互相竞赛争取模范。在每次清洁运动中都起了决定性的作用。政府并按时给与适当的表扬、奖励。依靠广大群众，该市去年春秋两季与今年春季共清除自伪满以来积存的和新生的垃圾共五十五万多吨；冬季并清除了积雪五万七千立方公尺。
