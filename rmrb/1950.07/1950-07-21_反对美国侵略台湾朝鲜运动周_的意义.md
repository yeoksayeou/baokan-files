　　The Significance of "Oppose U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Week"
　　Liu Ningyi
　　The criminal acts of U.S. imperialism in invading our territory of Taiwan and launching armed aggression against Korea have aroused widespread anger and opposition from people all over the world. Under the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we, the Chinese people, are holding "Oppose U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Week" to express our will and determination to defend world peace and oppose aggression.
　　The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and the Korean people must liberate all of Korea. Our two peoples have the strength and confidence to crush the aggressors' conspiracy. The Chinese people have already defeated Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. running dog in China, and driven out the U.S. forces from mainland China; the Korean people are severely attacking Syngman Rhee, the U.S. running dog in Korea, and have repeatedly defeated the U.S. interventionist army. These ironclad facts show that U.S. armed intervention will definitely not stop the two peoples' sacred struggle for liberation.
　　During this movement week, we must conduct universal and in-depth political education among the people of the whole country, so that everyone thoroughly understands that the United States is our enemy, that this enemy is extremely vicious and cruel, but that this enemy is not terrifying, but is a paper tiger. In the struggle against aggression, we will surely win, and the aggressors will surely fail. We should closely integrate this movement with the practical work of intensifying preparations for the liberation of Taiwan. For example, workers and peasants should link it to intensifying production, and students should link it to strengthening their studies.
　　The Chinese people have already defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by U.S. imperialism. Then we will certainly be able to liberate Taiwan and complete the liberation of all of China.
　　While actively preparing to liberate Taiwan, we must also do our best to support Korea. Korea is our friendly neighbor. In the struggle against Japanese imperialism, our two peoples stood on the same front. In the long-term struggle, the Chinese and Korean peoples have a deep friendship. Korea is now suffering from the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialists. We should undoubtedly support Korea. The Korean People's Army has basically defeated the Syngman Rhee puppet army, which was cultivated by U.S. imperialism, in the past three weeks, and has also dealt heavy blows to the U.S. military, liberating many cities in South Korea. The Korean people have proven that they have the strength to defeat the U.S. aggressors.
　　Of course, we cannot deny that the U.S. imperialists' desperate armed intervention has created some difficulties for the Korean people's struggle for liberation. But we must understand that the Korean people are fighting for justice, have high morale, and have the sympathy and support of the people all over the world. As for U.S. imperialism, it has neither the support of its own people nor the opposition of all peace-loving people in the world, and is in a very isolated position, which is a fundamental reason for the U.S.'s inevitable defeat.
　　The Korean people's severe attack on the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism has further exposed the true face of the U.S. imperialist paper tiger. The Korean people's victorious struggle is a powerful contribution to world peace. At the same time, our intensified efforts in preparing for the liberation of Taiwan are also an effective support for the Korean people. Our two peoples are closely related, and we must unite to defeat our common enemy. All peace-loving people in the world are closely related, and we must unite to defeat the warmongers who launch armed aggression.
　　The victory of the Chinese people and the victory of the Korean people have seriously struck at the entire conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to invade the world.
　　Our holding of "Oppose U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Week" is to defend our own independence and peace, thereby defending world peace. Opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace are two sides of the same coin. The peace signature campaign is a powerful way to mobilize the masses to oppose wars of aggression, and it should be combined with the "Oppose U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Week" to further enhance the awareness, organization, and practical work of the people of the whole country in opposing U.S. aggression and defending world peace. Let us fight together against U.S. imperialism.

　　“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”的意义
    刘宁一
    美国帝国主义侵略我国领土台湾和武装进攻朝鲜的罪恶行为，已经引起了全世界人民普遍的愤怒和反对。在世界工联的号召之下，我们中国人民，以举行“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”来表示我们保卫世界和平反对侵略的意志和决心。
    中国人民一定要解放台湾，朝鲜人民一定要解放全朝鲜。我们两国人民都有力量有把握粉碎侵略者的阴谋。中国人民已经打垮了美国在中国的走狗蒋介石，赶走了美国在中国大陆上的势力；朝鲜人民正在痛击美国在朝鲜的走狗李承晚，并已屡次击败美国干涉军。这铁一般的事实，说明美国的武装干涉，断然阻止不住两国人民争取解放的神圣斗争。
    我们要在这运动周向全国人民进行普遍而且深入的政治教育，使大家彻底明白美国是我们的敌人，这个敌人十分凶恶，十分残暴，但是这个敌人并不可怕，是一只纸老虎。在反侵略的斗争中，我们一定胜利，侵略者一定会失败。我们应当把这项运动和加紧准备解放台湾的实际工作紧密地结合起来。例如：工人和农民方面要联系到加紧生产，学生方面要联系到加强学习。
    中国人民已经战胜了日本帝国主义，以及美国帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派。那我们就一定能解放台湾，完成全中国的解放。
    我们一面要积极准备解放台湾，一面还得尽力来声援朝鲜。朝鲜是我国的友邦和邻邦。在反对日本帝国主义的斗争中，我们两国人民是站在一条战线的。在长期斗争中，中朝两国人民有着深厚的友谊。朝鲜，现正遭受着美国帝国主义者野蛮的侵略。我们毫无疑问应当声援朝鲜。朝鲜人民军三星期来已经基本上打败了美国帝国主义一手培养起来的李承晚伪军，而且给美军以沉重的打击，解放了南朝鲜的好多城市。朝鲜人民已经证明是有力量击败美国侵略者的。
    当然，我们不能否认，美国帝国主义穷凶极恶的武装干涉使得朝鲜人民争取解放的斗争面临了一些困难。但是我们必须明白，朝鲜人民是为正义而战，士气旺盛，而且得到全世界人民的同情和支持。至于美国帝国主义既没有本国广大人民的支持，又受着全世界一切爱好和平的人民的反对，处在十分孤立的地位，这就是美国必败的一个基本原因。
    朝鲜人民痛击美国帝国主义的侵略武力，使美帝国主义纸老虎真象更加暴露。朝鲜人民的胜利斗争，对世界和平是一个有力的贡献。同时，我们在解放台湾的准备工作上加紧努力，也就是对朝鲜人民有效地支援。我们两国人民是痛痒相关的，我们要团结起来，击败我们共同的敌人。全世界一切爱好和平的人们是痛痒相关的，我们要团结起来，击败发动武装侵略的战争贩子。
    中国人民的胜利和朝鲜人民的胜利、严重打击了美国帝国主义侵略全世界的整套阴谋。
    我们举行“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”，就是要保卫自己的独立与和平，从而来保卫全世界的和平。反对侵略战争与保卫世界和平是一个问题的两面。和平签名运动正是动员群众反对侵略战争的一个有力的方法，应当和“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”结合起来，使全国人民对于反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平的认识、组织和实际工作更提高一步。共同为反对美帝国主义而斗争。
