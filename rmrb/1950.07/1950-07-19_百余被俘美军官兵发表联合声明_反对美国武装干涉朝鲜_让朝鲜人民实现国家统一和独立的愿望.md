Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 18th: One hundred and fifteen American officers and soldiers captured by the Korean People's Army in the American war of aggression against Korea have issued a joint statement opposing intervention in Korea. The statement is as follows:

　　We are one hundred and fifteen American prisoners of war captured in a war that was never declared. Thirteen of us are currently being treated for serious injuries in a Korean hospital. One seriously injured has already died. We, these prisoners of war, have received the most humane treatment. When we were transferred to Korea, we were told that we were going to help the supposedly freedom-loving South Koreans defend their republic and restore peace and order. After arriving in South Korea, we noticed that the majority of South Koreans expressed a strong desire to unite with North Koreans to establish a unified and independent nation. They clearly expressed that they did not want others to interfere, and that they wanted to solve their own domestic problems themselves. They hate foreign intervention in Korea. We deeply know that foreign intervention is the cause of the Korean people's unrest for centuries, and the Korean people have such desires, so we, this group of prisoners, believe that all foreigners should leave Korea immediately and let the Koreans solve their own domestic problems.

　　The statement was signed by Lieutenant Ouginter of the 52nd Field Artillery Regiment of the 24th U.S. Division, Lieutenant Marat of the 34th Regiment of the 24th Division, and 113 others.

　　百余被俘美军官兵发表联合声明
    反对美国武装干涉朝鲜
    让朝鲜人民实现国家统一和独立的愿望
    【新华社平壤十八日电】在美国侵略朝鲜的战争中被朝鲜人民军俘虏的一百一十五名美军官兵，顷发表联合声明，反对干涉朝鲜。声明如下：
    我们是在一次不宣而战的战争中被俘的一百一十五名美国俘虏。我们里面有十三个人目前正在一所朝鲜医院里医治重伤。有一个受重伤的已经死去。我们这些战争的俘虏受到了最人道的待遇。当我们被调来朝鲜的时候，我们得到的解释是去帮助想像中的爱好自由的南朝鲜人保卫他们的共和国，恢复和平与秩序。我们到达南朝鲜之后，就注意到大多数的南朝鲜人都表示了一种想与北朝鲜人统一，以建立一个统一和独立的国家的强烈愿望。他们都明白表示不要他人干预，要由他们自己来解决他们自己的国内问题。他们憎恨外国在朝鲜进行干涉。我们深知外国的干涉是若干世纪以来使朝鲜人民不安的原因，而朝鲜人民又有这样一些愿望，因此，我们这群俘虏认为一切外国人应立即离开朝鲜，让朝鲜人自己去解决他们的国内问题。
    声明由美军第二十四师五十二野战炮团上尉牛金特，第二十四师三十四团中尉马拉特等一百十五人署名。
