　　Old Man Tian Guides Land Reclamation for Rice Planting
    Jian Po
    Old Man Tian had made a living through labor since he was a child, accumulating forty-five years of experience in managing rice paddies. He was a technical advisor for a certain regiment's farm. When he was invited to do this, he thought, "Isn't the People's Liberation Army farming for the public and for the people?" So he readily agreed, saying, "Okay! I'll contribute as much as I can, I'll sell my old bones a bit more."
    When he arrived at the team, everyone called him "Uncle." Seeing how the army respected and trusted him, he said whatever he knew.
    Two things, which seemed ordinary in the army, were new and fresh to Old Man Tian. Once, while digging a large canal, water was struck, and the soldiers stood in the cold mud water, working happily. Another time, during seed soaking, a bag of seeds was almost washed away by the water, and a soldier automatically took off his cotton coat and jumped into the water, using his head to hold it up. Old Man Tian kept telling people about these things. He also praised, "The People's Liberation Army is truly amazing! They work so enthusiastically without any officials watching, and when they discuss matters with the people, it's always 'Uncle this, Uncle that.' I've never seen such a team in my whole life!"
    The army turned a barren alkaline滩 near the Hai River into rice paddies, which was an arduous task. The army hired engineers, but some of the engineers' plans differed from the local conditions. Take the small drainage ditches for draining water, for example. The plan was to place them every twenty meters, which was fine for ordinary alkaline land, but using that on this barren alkaline滩 made it difficult to wash away the alkali. Especially when installing the large gate for the Hai River water inlet, Old Man Tian took one look at the engineer's plan and bluntly said, "This gate opening is too narrow and the bottom is too high, it won't work! It has to be changed, otherwise there won't be enough water and the alkali won't be washed away!" He explained, "The opening is narrow and the gate bottom is so high, it's like building a concrete dam for the Hai River. Small tides can't even get in, so what will you use to reclaim the wasteland and irrigate the land?" The engineer followed his advice and widened the opening and lowered the gate bottom by two feet. Later, it proved that if they hadn't followed Old Man Tian's advice, the water wouldn't have been enough and the alkali wouldn't have been washed away.
    When reclaiming the wasteland and washing away the alkali, Old Man Tian stayed in that rice field of more than ten hectares. After each washing, he would peel open the floating mud on the ground, take a piece from underneath and put it in his mouth to taste, and then take a sip of water from the drainage ditch to see how far the washing had gone. He was always afraid that it wouldn't be washed thoroughly enough. After nine washes, Old Man Tian said, "It's done! The seedlings are guaranteed." He had a smile on his face when he said this. While guiding the opening of canals, reclamation of wasteland, and washing away of alkali, Old Man Tian also took care of the seedling cultivation work on those forty hectares of land. Before sowing, the division held a technical research conference, and Old Man Tian also participated. The division leader said, "If the seedlings aren't cultivated well, all previous efforts will be wasted. This is an arduous combat mission." At that time, Old Man Tian said in his heart, "Just wait and see how well I raise these seedlings for the superiors!" Old Man Tian was very meticulous. During the wasteland reclamation, he recorded the speed of water infiltration in each furrow so that he would have a good understanding when managing the land after sowing. He also carefully calculated how much seed should be sown per acre, and what kind of seedlings were suitable for the new land.
    Once the seeds were sown in the ground, Old Man Tian was constantly thinking about them, checking on them several times a day. He would always check the weather at night. Several times, he saw the weather change in the middle of the night, so he immediately put on his clothes, ran to the seedling field, and called the seedling team to draw water to prevent the rain from damaging the buds. For several days in a row, with wind and rain, Old Man Tian still directed the watering and draining. However, unexpectedly, after the wind and rain, the tips of the buds turned yellow, the roots turned black, and red nematodes appeared. Old Man Tian was so anxious that he couldn't sleep or eat. He squatted in the field day and night to treat the buds. Based on his decades of seedling cultivation experience, he proposed the method of drying the water in the fields. The leadership agreed to do so. Old Man Tian watched in the seedling field for seven days and seven nights. The seedlings improved, took root, and turned green again. Only then did he breathe a sigh of relief. After that, he was even more careful, guiding the seedling team on what kind of water to release and what kind of fertilizer to apply every day according to the weather, wind, and height of the seedlings. The soldiers did everything according to Old Man Tian's instructions, and if they didn't understand, they would ask him for advice repeatedly.
    The seedlings grew day by day, a large expanse of dark green, each plant strong and sturdy. Everyone who saw them praised, "These seedlings are growing so well, they've surpassed everything!" Old Man Tian was so happy, but his purplish-red wrinkled face looked a little thinner than before.
    When transplanting began, his focus shifted to guiding the transplanting. Although the troops had studied for a few days, they were not very accurate in their movements, sometimes planting too deep, sometimes the distances were not uniform. Old Man Tian wandered around the field all day long, pointing out whatever was wrong. When he saw the soldiers throwing the seedlings around, he said unhappily, "Comrades! It hurts my heart when you throw the seedlings around like that!" He immediately stopped them, and then reported it to the superiors, asking them to educate the troops.
    As the days went by, Old Man Tian became as familiar with everyone as if they were family. When he had free time, Old Man Tian would smoke his pipe and talk about his past. He said, "My family didn't even have an acre of land. When the Japanese were here, I was a slave, planting rice paddies for the Japanese. After a year of hard work, all the rice was taken away in the autumn, and they only gave me some rice bran. After the Japanese surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was still the same. I still worked for the landlords all year round. The poor are always poor!" Speaking of this, Old Man Tian suddenly said happily, "The People's Liberation Army has come, and the suffering people are living a better life. The famous Quan Fa Hao family (a local large landlord)'s seventeen hectares of rice paddies, along with the livestock and carts, have been handed over to the farmers' associations in our two villages to plant. I will also get some grain in the autumn! After the land reform, life will be even better. Now I feel so happy, and I'm especially happy to work."

　　田老汉指导开荒种稻
    建魄
    田老汉从小就凭劳动吃饭，四十五年来积累了一套经营稻田的经验。他是某团农场的技术指导。聘请他做这事时，他想：“解放军种地还不是为了公家、为老百姓吗？”于是满口答应说：“好！有多大力出多大力，我再卖一卖老。”
    到了队上，大家都称呼他“老大爷”，他见部队这样尊敬他、相信他，自己便知道啥说啥。
    有两桩事，说起来在部队是很平凡的，但在老汉却是从没见过的新鲜事。有一次挖大渠挖出了水，战士一个个仍然站在冰冷的泥水里很高兴的工作着。还有一次，在浸种时，一袋种子险些叫水冲走，战士见了，自动脱去棉衣跳到水里用头顶了上来。这些事老汉不断对人说。还夸奖道：“解放军真了不的呀！干起活来，也没当官的看着，干的那么欢，跟老百姓研究个事总是老大爷长、老大爷短的，我一辈子可没见过这样的队伍呀！”
    部队把靠近海河的一块荒凉碱滩开成稻田，这是一个艰巨的工作。部队上请了工程师，但工程师有的计划与当地情况有出入，拿修排水用的水小沟来说，计划是每条距离廿米，在一般的碱地上正好，可是在这块荒碱滩上用，碱就不易洗净了。特别是按装海河引水口的大闸时，工程师的计划，老汉一看就不客气地说：“这闸口窄、底高，不行呀！可得改，不改水不够用，碱也洗不净！”他解释说：“口窄，闸底那么高，如同给海河打了个洋灰坝，小潮根本进不来，你拿什么拉荒浇地呀？”工程师依着他的话把口开大了，把闸底又往下落了二尺。后来的事实证明要不按老汉的意见水就是不够用，碱就是洗不净。
    拉荒洗碱时，老汉在那方圆十几顷的稻地里守候着。每洗过一水，就扒开地里浮泥，由底下掏出块放在嘴里尝，再往排水沟里捧口水喝一喝，看看洗到什么程度；老怕洗不到家。洗到九遍以后，老汉说：“行了！保住苗了。”说话时，脸上带着微笑。田老汉一边指导着开渠、拉荒、洗碱，同时还照顾那六十亩地的育苗工作。在还没下种时，师里召开技术研究会，老汉也参加了，师首长讲：“育不好苗前功尽弃，这是艰巨的战斗任务。”那时老汉就在心里说：“咱长出苗叫上级看吧！”老汉心挺细，拉荒时就把一畦一畦的渗水快慢情形记下来，为了下种后管理时心里有底，他还细心盘算着，一亩应下多少种，长的秧才适合新地用。
    种子下到地里，老汉时时刻刻都在惦记着，每天总得看几回。晚上总要看看天气。有几次半夜看到天变了，便马上穿上衣裳，跑到秧田，喊起育苗队来拉水，防备下雨打坏了芽子。一连几天，又是风又是雨，老汉照样指挥着上水、落水。但是，没想到在风雨后，芽子尖黄了，根黑了，又起了红线虫，老汉急得觉也睡不好，饭也吃不下了。他黑夜白天蹲在地里治芽子，根据自己几十年来育苗的经验；提出落干水来晒的办法，领导上同意这样做了。老汉一连在秧田里看了七天七夜，苗儿好转了，扎了根复了青，他才松了口气。以后他更经心啦，每日根据天气阴晴、风候气象、苗的高低，指导着育苗队该放什么样的水，进什么样的肥。战士都按老汉的话去做，弄不清还向他三番五次请教。
    苗儿一天天长起来，黑绿黑绿的一大片，棵棵挺壮实。人人看了人人夸：“这苗儿长得好，压倒了这一片呀！”田老汉心里多么高兴呵，但是他那紫膛色皱纹的脸显得比从前可有些消瘦了。
    开始插秧了，他的工作重点又转到指导插秧。部队虽然学习了几天，但手头还不大准，不是深，就是距离不一般大。老汉一天在地里东转西转，见到那不对，就说那。他看见战士乱扔秧苗，就不高兴的说：“同志！你们乱扔秧苗我可心疼呀！”马上制止，回来还汇报给上级，叫教育部队。
    日子长了，老汉和大家熟习得跟一家人一样，有了空儿，老汉就抽着烟叨念起他过去的事，他说：“我家一亩地也没有，日本在时当亡国奴，给鬼子种稻地，忙了一年，到秋上把稻米都给拉完了，就给点稻糠。日本投降了，蒋介石匪帮还是一样，我还是一年到头给地主家干活，穷人老是穷呀！”说到这，老汉忽然又高兴地说：“解放军来了，受苦人可好过啦，有名的全发号家（当地大地主）那十七顷稻地连牲口带车交给我们这两个村的农会种了，秋后我也要分点粮食呀！土地改革以后，日子就更要好过了。现在我心里那么痛快，干活也特别高兴。”
