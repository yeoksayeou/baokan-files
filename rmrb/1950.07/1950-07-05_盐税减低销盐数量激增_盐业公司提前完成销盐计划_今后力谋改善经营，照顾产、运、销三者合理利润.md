　　Salt Tax Reduction Leads to Surge in Salt Sales
    Salt Company Completes Sales Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Strives to Improve Operations and Ensure Reasonable Profits for Production, Transportation, and Sales
    [From Our Own Correspondent] Since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council halved the salt tax collection on June 1, the salt market has shown a significant upturn, with salt sales by the salt companies increasing considerably. By mid-June, the various levels of companies affiliated with the China Salt Industry Company had sold over 1,168,729 dan of edible salt, completing 112.7% of the company's June salt sales plan. Among these, the North China region completed 91.7% of its monthly plan, the East China region completed 94.5% of its monthly plan, and the Central and Southern China region completed 151.7% of its monthly plan, with total sales exceeding the total sales of May by 68.82%.
    The sales volume of salt merchants has also increased significantly. For example, salt merchants in Tianjin sold 5,864.16 dan in the first ten days of June, exceeding the total sales volume of May by 6.24%. Salt merchants in Zhangjiakou sold only 528.94 dan in the entire month of May, while they sold 669.99 dan in the first ten days of June. At the same time, the number of seaside transportation declarations is also increasing sharply. For example, salt transporters in Tianjin declared 17,545 dan of edible salt for seaside transportation within ten days after the salt tax reduction, exceeding the total declared amount for May by 148%.
    The increase in salt sales in June is mainly due to the fact that salt merchants in various regions mostly stopped purchasing salt starting in March, and by June, their inventories had gradually decreased, and consumers also needed to replenish their salt supplies. Secondly, after the salt tax reduction, the conversion rate between salt and grain changed, relatively increasing the people's purchasing power. For example, before the salt price adjustment in Baoding, one jin of millet cost 920 yuan, and one jin of edible salt cost 1,580 yuan, with one jin of millet only exchangeable for 0.57 jin of salt. After the adjustment, one jin of millet could be exchanged for one jin of salt. In Anqing, it used to take one shi and two dou of medium-ripe rice to exchange for one dan of salt, but now one shi of rice can exchange for 135 jin of salt. At the same time, it coincided with the wheat harvest in some areas at the beginning of the month, and farmers transported new wheat and chickens to the city to exchange for salt, resulting in more active exchanges between urban and rural areas than before.
    The business of salt companies in various regions has also been greatly strengthened. Many staff members not only sell salt during the day but also fill out receipts in advance at night to shorten the time for customers to purchase salt. In terms of business methods, they also pay attention to combining with fraternal companies and cooperatives to strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. For example, the Zhenjiang and Wuxi companies have established a consignment relationship with the Sunan Cooperative Federation, coordinating the collection of silkworm cocoons and promoting the sale of edible salt, which is convenient for merchants and increases sales. For example, the Wuxi branch company often sells around 2,000 dan per day.
    Currently, in response to the current situation, in addition to calling on its affiliates to urgently improve their own operations, reduce costs, and ensure reasonable profits for production, transportation, and sales, the company will also implement the policy of considering both public and private interests based on the resolutions of the National Transportation and Sales Conference. It will work with local industrial and commercial departments in various branch companies, unite and lead salt merchants, go deep into the countryside, vigorously promote sales, and ensure civilian use and tax revenue, to better fulfill the responsibilities that state-owned trade should bear.

　　盐税减低销盐数量激增
    盐业公司提前完成销盐计划 
    今后力谋改善经营，照顾产、运、销三者合理利润
    【本报讯】自六月一日政务院财政经济委员会将盐税减半征收后，食盐市场顿显活跃，盐业公司销盐量较前大为增加。截至六月中旬止，中国盐业公司所属各级公司共销出食盐一百一十六万八千七百二十九担多，完成该公司六月份销盐计划百分之一一二·七。其中华北区完成月计划百分之九一·七，华东区完成月计划百分之九四·五，中南区完成月计划百分之一五一·七，共计超过五月份全月销量百分之六八·八二。
    盐商销量亦显著增加。例如，天津盐商六月上旬即销出五、八六四·一六担，超过五月份全月销量百分之六·二四；张垣盐商五月份全月仅销五二八·九四担，而在六月上旬即销达六六九·九九担。同时海滩报运数字也在激增。如天津运商在盐税降低后十天内，海滩报运食盐即达一万七千五百四十五担，超过五月份全月报运数百分之一四八。
    六月盐销量的增加，主要由于三月份起各地盐商多停止购进，到六月份存量已逐渐减少，消费者亦需要补进食盐；其次是盐税降低后，在盐粮的换算上起了变化，相对提高了人民的购买力。如保定未调整盐价前小米一斤九百二十元，食盐每斤一千五百八十元，一斤米只换○·五七斤盐，调整后一斤米可换到一斤盐；安庆过去一石二斗中熟米才换一担盐，现在一石米可换盐一三五斤。同时适逢月初部分地区已麦收，农民多运新麦及鸡等物品进城换盐，致城乡交换亦较前活跃起来。
    各地盐业公司业务亦大为加强，许多工作人员白天卖完盐，晚上还预先填好单据以缩短购户购盐时间；在经营方式上并注意结合兄弟公司及合作社，加强城乡物资交流。如镇江、无锡公司已与苏南合作总社建立代销关系，配合收茧，推销食盐，商贩称便，销量增加。如无锡支公司经常日销在两千担左右。
    现该公司针对目前情况，除号召所属亟力改善本身经营，减低成本，保证照顾产、运、销三者合理的利润外，并即根据全国运销会议议决案，贯彻公私兼顾政策，使各地分支公司结合当地工商部门，团结领导盐商，深入农村，大力推销，保证民用、税收，更好地去完成国营贸易应负的任务。
