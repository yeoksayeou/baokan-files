　　"We Want to Learn Culture"
　　Shen Dinghua, Propaganda Minister of a certain army of the Northwest Military Region

　　Love of science and culture is a tradition of the People's Liberation Army. If someone asks me, "What do you want now?" I will answer him from the standpoint of a PLA soldier: "We want culture!"
　　In the People's Liberation Army, the moving stories of cadres and soldiers eagerly seeking to learn culture today are as endless as the moving war stories during the combat period.
　　In our military headquarters, the army commander, who is already over forty years old and has lost a large amount of hair, is searching everywhere for Russian textbooks and Russian teachers, eager to learn Russian. The deputy political commissar, who was wounded in the head during the war and frequently suffers from headaches, has found a set of arithmetic textbooks and is learning arithmetic. After one and a half months of self-study, he has preliminarily completed the four operations of integers, fractions, and decimals. In early May, I went to Xi'an for a meeting and asked the three division political directors what they wanted me to bring. Their unanimous answer was: "Books!" One division political commissar allocated 1 million-plus yuan at one time to print several thousand copies of the "People's Army Primer" for the companies. One day, a deputy political commissar of a regiment took his troops to repair roads in the Tianshui-Baoji section. He specifically came to me to ask how much a hydroelectric generator costs. He wanted to use the water power of the Wei River to build a small power station, not only to grind flour for the troops but also to install a large radio on a nearby mountain for the soldiers to listen to while they repaired the road. This regimental deputy political commissar's plan may not be realized at present (mainly due to funding and technical limitations), but his idea is very touching.
　　Many places in the Tianbao section have no houses, so the political department of a division specifically built a large building for the library.
　　Due to funding limitations, the Xi'an Masses Daily can only be subscribed to and distributed to the battalion level, and very few books are distributed. We frequently receive letters and phone calls from below requesting more books and newspapers, some even proposing, "Deduct it from our allowances to buy them!"
　　As early as the eve of the liberation of Shijiazhuang by our North China troops, the North China Military Region film team rushed to a regiment responsible for assault tasks to screen "Kronstadt Sailors," greatly boosting the morale of the troops. Many soldiers were determined to "learn from Klaideng" (the hero in the film). During the battle, many of these determined soldiers became China's "Klaidengs." Not long ago, the regimental film team rushed to the Tianbao section to screen the film on site. Although the film was a bit old, the soldiers' enthusiasm was very high. When it was screened in one unit, it rained, but no one left, and they watched it until the end, completely soaked. When a certain regiment heard that the film team had arrived, even though they had already worked for seven hours, they gathered more than a hundred people and went to the station to welcome the film team. Another unit lived in the mountains, and the soldiers, together with the film team comrades, carried the projector parts, weighing more than two thousand catties, to a mountain two or three li high.
　　Let's talk about the cultural learning of the troops. When Yin Chuan and Lanzhou were liberated and the troops began to transition to peaceful reorganization, when the allowances were issued, almost every soldier bought an inexpensive fountain pen. Once, I took a train back from Xi'an with a class, and all the way I saw the soldiers intently looking at each other's pens, testing them, and even taking my pen to study and figure it out. During geography education, a livestock tender comrade bought a pocket-sized map. Many soldiers were reluctant to spend their allowances and bought lamp oil themselves to study culture.
　　As long as we think about the suffering and restrictions that workers and peasants endured in the old society for many years, it is inevitable that they will demand a cultural turnaround once they have politically and economically turned over; as long as we understand that our troops will be built into a regularized national defense force in the future, it is not difficult to understand why this People's Liberation Army, mainly composed of Chinese workers and peasants, is so eager for culture after the basic victory of the war.
　　Under the conditions allowed by the state and social economy, let all printing presses roll and publish more popular and meaningful books for the people and the People's Liberation Army! Especially books that improve cultural, scientific, and political knowledge. Let all cameras move and make more good movies for us. We welcome more film teams to come to the troops. As long as the film content is meaningful, old films are also new to us! Let more intellectuals and cultural workers do more beneficial work for the People's Army! [Xinhua News Agency]

### “我们要学习文化”

　　“我们要学习文化”
    西北军区某军宣传部长  沈定华
    热爱科学和文化是人民解放军的传统。如果有人问我：“你们现在要什么？”我将站在一个解放军战士的立场上答复他：“我们要文化！”
    在解放军里，干部、战士们今天渴求学习文化的动人事迹，是和作战时期动人的战迹一样说不完的。
    在我们军部里，年岁已经四十多，头发已经秃了一大半的军长，到处找俄文读本，找俄文教员，急着要学俄文。那个在战争中头部挂了花，经常脑子痛的副政治委员，找来了一套算术课本在学算术，一个半月的自修，已经初步学完了整数、分数、小数、四则。五月初我到西安去开会，问三个师政治主任要捎些什么？他们一致的答复是：“书！”一个师政治委员，一次拨出一百几十万元给连队印了几千本《人民军队三字经》。一天一个团的副政委带部队到天（水）、宝（鸡）段修路去，他专门来找我，问我一个水力发电马达要多少钱。他想利用渭河水力，搞小型发电。除了给部队磨面，还想在工地附近山头给战士们装个大收音机，让战士们一面修路，一面听无线电。这位团副政委的计划，目前不一定能实现（主要是经费和技术限制），但他的想法是很使人感动的。
    天宝段很多地方没房子，一个师政治部专门给图书馆盖了一个大房子。
    由于经费的限制，西安群众日报只能订发到营，很多书也发的很少。我们经常收到下边要求增发书报的信件和电话，有的甚至提出“扣我们的津贴费买也行！”
    早在我们华北部队解放石家庄前夜，华北军区电影队赶到一个担负突击任务的团里去放映《克隆斯达海军》，大大地鼓舞了部队的士气。很多战士下决心“学习克来登”（片里的英雄）。战斗进行中这批下了决心的战士们有不少人当了中国的“克来登”。不久前，团电影队赶到天宝段现场上去放映。片子虽然旧些，但战士们的热情是很高的。在一个单位放映时，遇到下雨，谁也不走，一直看到映完，身上都湿透了。某团听说放映队到了，虽然已经作了七小时工，但一号召就集合起一百多人到车站上去迎接放映队。另一单位住在山上，战士们就和放映队同志一起，把重二千多斤的放映机件抬到二三里地高的山上去。
    说说部队文化学习吧。当解放了银川、兰州开始转入和平整训的时候，发下一次津贴费，几乎每一个战士都买了一枝廉价自来水笔。一次我和一个班一同坐火车从西安回来，一路上看见战士们专心一意地互相看笔、试笔；还取了我的笔去，研究、捉摸。在进行地理教育的时候，一个饲养员同志买了一本袖珍地图。很多战士把津贴舍不得花，自己添买灯油学文化。
    只要想一想工农群众在旧社会多年所受的压迫和限制的痛苦，今天一旦政治上、经济上翻了身，必然要求在文化上翻身；只要懂得我们的部队今后还要建设为正规化的国防军，就不难理解这支以中国工农群众为主要组成部分的人民解放军，在战争基本上胜利以后为什么这样地渴求文化。
    在国家、社会经济条件允许之下，让一切印刷机滚动起来，为人民和人民解放军出版更多的通俗而有意义的书吧！特别是提高文化科学知识和政治知识的书。让一切摄影机都动起来，为我们拍制更多的好电影。我们欢迎更多的放映队到部队上来，只要影片内容有意义，旧片子对我们来说也是新的！让更多的知识分子和文化工作者为人民军队更多做些有益的工作吧！【新华社讯】
