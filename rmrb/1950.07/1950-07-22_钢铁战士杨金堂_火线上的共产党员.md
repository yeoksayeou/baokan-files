    Iron Warrior Yang Jintang
    —— A Communist Party Member on the Front Lines
    Wang Liuqiu
    1. During the Huaihai Campaign, our army's battalion was ordered to start a siege operation against Chen Village. Yang Jintang, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Company, First Platoon, repeatedly refused to stay behind to rest, and participated in digging trenches despite being ill. He thought, "Difficulty is the time to test a Communist Party member." When the company commander took his shovel, he said, "How can I watch everyone else sweat?"
    2. The battalion headquarters ordered the Fourth Company to use a squad of soldiers to quickly occupy an independent tomb mound twenty meters away from the enemy's bunker in the southeast of Chen Village to protect the safety of the entire battalion's siege operation. The company commander decided to use the First Squad and issued them the order. Yang Jintang said, "Company commander, rest assured, we guarantee to complete the task."
    3. He led three soldiers to pounce on the tomb mound. The enemy in the bunker fired a burst of machine gun grenades around them. Yang Jintang was wounded in the head. He whispered to Little Xu, who was also wounded, "Little Xu, can you crawl down?" and instructed the other two soldiers to quickly dig concealed pits and prepare hand grenades.
    4. The enemy stopped firing. The company commander ran up and asked, "Can you hold on?" He pushed the company commander, "Get down quickly, we can't have too many people up here. With me here, the enemy won't be able to rush up." There was movement in the bunker, and he immediately ordered the two soldiers: "Prepare hand grenades, the enemy is about to counterattack!"

    钢铁战士杨金堂
    ——火线上的共产党员
    王流秋
    1、淮海战役中，我军某营奉命向陈庄展开迫近作业，四连一班副杨金堂几次拒绝留后方休息，抱病参加挖战壕，他想：“困难才是考验共产党员的时候”。连长夺下他的铁锹，他说：“我怎么能看着大家流汗呢？”
    2、营部命四连以一个班的兵力，猛速占领陈庄东南距敌地堡二十米的独立墳包，掩护全营迫近作业的安全。连长决定使用第一班，向他们下达命令，杨金堂说：“连长放心，我们保证完成任务”。
    3、他带三个战士扑到墳包，地堡里敌人一阵机枪榴弹打到身边，杨金堂头部负伤，他低声向负伤的小许说：“小许你能爬下去吗？”并吩咐其他二战士快挖隐蔽坑，准备手榴弹。
    4、敌人停止了射击，连长跑上来问：“你能坚持吗？”他推连长一把：“快下去吧，这里不能多登人，有我在敌人冲不上来的。”地堡里敌人有动静，他即命令两战士：“准备手榴弹，敌人要反冲锋了！”    （附图片）
