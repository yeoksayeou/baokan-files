　　Hunyuan County Emphasizes Radio Broadcasting Work
    Greatly Promoting Work and Study
    [Our Newspaper] Since early April, all agencies in Hunyuan County, Chahar Province, have installed radios and organized the listening to radio broadcasts. Due to the importance attached by the leadership, some achievements have been made in guiding work and assisting study. The county has successively organized ten listening groups, with a total of sixty-six participants, including responsible cadres from various departments. Over the past three months, various specialized programs have been listened to in an organized manner forty-two times. Before listening to each specialized program, the relevant departments issued notices to organize relevant cadres, and sometimes also absorbed some members of the masses to participate. When the social science lectures began to be listened to, a meeting of responsible cadres from various agencies was convened to study the listening methods, and it was decided that each agency would be jointly responsible for recording the content of the broadcast. In May, the county reorganized the study organization, divided into groups, and all those participating in theoretical study participated in listening to the broadcasts of political economics and the history of social development. However, due to insufficient power supply for the radios and the inconsistency between the pace of learning and the pace of broadcasting, the social science lectures have not been able to be listened to regularly and in an organized manner as planned. The daily recording of news listening is better, and it can be copied on time. The CCP County Committee is responsible for publishing the "News Broadcast" publication, and important news and instructions and notices from provincial agencies are immediately conveyed after listening, so that work can be planned early and developed quickly. The work of listening to broadcasts is closely linked with the eleven blackboards in the city, and important broadcast news is immediately written on the blackboards. The blackboards have attracted the attention of the urban and rural masses, and there are many readers. Many farmers always go to see if there are any major national events or important instructions in production announced on the blackboards every time they enter the city. In addition, while listening to the radio, the county has strengthened communication with the radio station, organized five communication groups, and has twenty-four correspondents. Zhang Tianliang, the county magistrate, and Gu Chao, the secretary, and others voluntarily wrote articles for the radio station, sending a total of seventy-two articles in three months. Forty-two of them have been adopted by the radio station, reflecting the local work situation and spreading the experience in the work. In the three months of listening to the radio, the county has the following experiences: First, leading cadres must first recognize the importance of broadcasting work ideologically, learn to use this modern propaganda tool to guide work and help study, and set an example by organizing everyone to listen on time in an organized manner, and promptly check the listening work. Second, broadcasting work and communication work should be closely integrated to promote each other. If the articles written are adopted and broadcast, it will make everyone pay more attention to listening. Third, always pay attention to the opinions of the audience and the effect of listening in order to improve. Fourth, pay attention to the storage and use of radios and reserve sufficient power. The radio room should be selected in an appropriate location and have the necessary equipment to ensure the smooth progress of the listening work.

　　浑源县重视广播收音工作
    对推动工作和学习作用很大
    【本报讯】察哈尔省浑源县各机关，于四月上旬开始分别装置收音机，组织收听电台广播。由于领导上的重视，在指导工作、帮助学习方面都有一些成绩。该县先后组织了十个收听小组，共六十六人参加，其中包括各部门的负责干部。三个月来有组织的收听了各种专门节目四十二次。在收听每个专门节目之前，均由有关部门发出通知，组织有关干部，有时还吸收一部分群众参加。在开始收听社会科学讲座时，曾召开了各机关负责干部会议，研究了收听办法，并决定由各机关共同负责记录广播内容。五月份该县重新整顿了学习组织，划分了小组，凡参加理论学习的，都参加收听政治经济学、社会发展史的播讲。但由于收音机的电力不足及学习进度和播讲的进度不一致，对社会科学讲座还未能按计划有组织的经常收听。每日的记录新闻收听较好，能按时抄记。并由中共县委会负责出版“新闻广播”刊物，对重要新闻与省级各机关的指示、通知等，收听后立即传达，使工作能够及早筹划，迅速展开。收听广播工作并与城内十一处黑板报紧密联系，重要的广播新闻，立刻写在黑板报上。黑板报已引起城乡群众的重视，读者很多。许多农民每次进城总要去看看黑板报上有没有什么国家大事或生产中的重要指示公布出来。此外，在收听广播的同时，该县又加强了对电台的通讯工作，组织了五个通讯组，有二十四个通讯员。该县县长张天亮、秘书顾潮等均自动为电台写稿，三个月内共发出稿件七十二件。其中四十二件已为电台采用，反映了当地工作情况，也传播了工作中的经验。在三个月收听广播中，该县有下列几点体会：一、首先领导干部要从思想上认识到广播工作的重要性，学会利用这一种现代化的宣传工具来指导工作，帮助学习，并以身作则，发动大家有组织的按时收听，并及时检查收听工作。二、广播工作与通讯工作要密切结合，互相推动。所写的稿如被采用广播出来，那就会更使大家重视收听工作。三、经常注意听众的意见和收听的效果，以求改进。四、对收音机要注意保管和使用，储备充足的电力。收音室应择适当的地点，并有必要的设备，使收听工作能顺利进行。
