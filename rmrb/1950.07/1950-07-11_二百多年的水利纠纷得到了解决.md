Over Two Centuries of Water Conservancy Disputes Resolved
    Liu Wenshan

    The Huangqu water conservancy dispute, unresolved for over two centuries, has been thoroughly resolved under the leadership of the People's Government. This is a major event in the history of water conservancy in Northwest China.

    The Huangqu originates from the north of Yucheng, Gansu, gathering from dozens of small canals and gradually merging into the Shule River in Anxi County to the northwest, with a total length of over 300 li. This irrigation canal was opened during the reign of Emperor Yongzheng in the Qing Dynasty. Farmers on both sides of the canal rely on it for their livelihood; without the canal water, they cannot grow crops.

    Therefore, for over two centuries, water disputes occurred between Yumen and Anxi counties every year. Lawsuits, fights, imprisonment, and paying with lives formed feudal regional struggles. At that time, only those with power and influence could use more water; poor farmers were always short of water.

    Since the liberation of Gansu, governments at all levels in Yumen and Anxi counties have deeply felt that this water conservancy dispute is a major problem in agricultural production. Many impoverished masses have also voiced urgent demands from the painful lessons of history.

    In March of this year, the county heads of Yumen and Anxi counties invited people familiar with water conservancy to establish a joint water conservancy committee for the two counties, initially understanding the dispute situation at various ports along the canal and obtaining some agreements, but the problem had not yet been specifically resolved. At this time, because it was still early before the water use season, most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude: "The Kuomintang reactionaries never resolved this dispute, let's see how the Communist Party will handle it?" So they mostly kept silent.

    In May of this year, as water was needed for the land, the county heads of the two counties, along with water conservancy committee members, village representatives, and agricultural association directors, gathered in Yumen to carry out water distribution work. However, the old disputes were not resolved, and the canal water could not be distributed. Some of the people selected from the five dispute-prone areas in Yumen were landlords and rich peasants, who were the "pettifoggers" who often litigated due to water disputes in the past, and the behind-the-scenes manipulators of gang fights. Therefore, after half a month of discussion, no solution was reached. During the meeting, incidents of obstructing water and fighting broke out in four places. The most serious was in Mogutan, where more than 300 men and women gathered for a mass meeting, preparing for struggle.

    The leading organs examined the reasons why the problem could not be solved for half a month and found that the primary reason was that cadres were engaged in departmentalism, leading the masses to compete for superiority. Secondly, both sides of the masses had the idea of taking advantage and using more water, refusing to compromise. The leading organs addressed these problems, conducted enlightening persuasive work on the representatives, and turned their erroneous thinking around. At the same time, the representatives of the five canal mouths with disputes were divided into five groups, allowing them to study water distribution methods themselves.

    The leading organs then formulated several water distribution principles based on the methods proposed by each group: (1) Share benefits and losses (everyone uses water when there is water, and everyone uses less on average when there is a shortage). (2) Give priority to using familiar land, and then irrigate newly opened wasteland with the surplus. (3) Oppose unfair old water regulations, and everyone uses water reasonably. Everyone agreed to these principles, and based on these principles, they re-established a new plan for the amount of water to be used and the time of use according to the population, number of households, and land area of each port, which was unanimously agreed upon and jointly signed to guarantee implementation.

    Although some of the representatives had impure elements, after this meeting, most of the representatives had a new understanding. The leading organs organized them as government work teams, with county cadres as team leaders, responsible for leadership. They were told the steps to implement the meeting resolutions themselves. Everyone was satisfied and confident in this work.

    After returning, each group first convened village cadre meetings, clarifying their past erroneous ideas about water disputes; then convened agricultural associations to ensure that members had a consistent understanding of the new plan; and then convened mass meetings to discuss specific implementation methods. As a result, the new plan was successfully implemented in various places within three days, and some places even passed resolutions and penalty regulations prohibiting the destruction of the new plan.

    As soon as the new plan was implemented, the masses in Yumen automatically dug springs and wells in Chuanbei Town to make the water source abundant, so as to supply the downstream Anxi masses with water for irrigation. The water conservancy disputes of more than two centuries have since been eliminated by cooperative and mutually beneficial actions.

　　二百多年的水利纠纷得到了解决
    刘文山
    二百多年以来没有解决的皇渠水利纠纷，解放后在人民政府领导下，已获得了彻底的解决。这是西北水利史上的一件大事。
    皇渠起源于甘肃玉门北城，集数十小渠逐渐向西北合流入安西县的疏勒河，共长三百余华里。这是清朝雍正年间开的灌溉渠。两岸农民就靠着这渠活命，没有渠水，他们就种不了庄稼。
    因此，二百多年来，玉门、安西两县年年发生争水纠纷。诉讼、打架、坐监牢、偿人命，形成了封建性的区域斗争。那时只有有权有势的人可以多用水；穷苦农民老是水不够用。
    甘肃解放以后，玉门、安西两县的各级政府，都深深感觉到这水利纠纷是农业生产中的大问题。很多贫苦群众也从历史的痛苦教训中发出了迫切的要求。
    玉门、安西两县县长今年三月邀约了熟习水利的人，成立了两县联合水利委员会，初步了解了沿渠各口岸的纠纷情况，获得了一些协议，但问题还没有得到具体的解决。这时候，因为距离用水时间还早，多数人都抱着旁观态度：“国民党反动派一直没有解决这纠纷，看共产党又怎样搞法？”所以他们多不啃声。
    今年五月，水要上地了，两县县长与水利委员以及各乡村代表、农会主任都聚集玉门，进行分水的工作。但是旧的纠纷没有解决，渠水就没法分配。玉门五个闹纠纷地方选来的人，有的是地主富农，他们就是过去因闹争水纠纷而常常打官司的“讼棍”和打群架的幕后操纵者。所以一直讨论了半个月，还没有得到解决。在开会期间，就发生了阻水打架事件四起，最严重的是，蘑姑滩还集合了三百多男女群众开大会，又要准备斗争。
    领导机关检查半月来解决不了问题的原因，发觉首先是干部闹本位主义，领导群众争高低。其次是双方群众都存有占便宜、多用水的思想，互不让步。领导机关针对了这些毛病，对代表们进行了启发性的说服工作，把他们的错误思想扭转过来。同时又把有纠纷的五个渠口的代表分成五个小组，让他们自己研究分水办法。
    领导机关又根据各小组提出的办法，拟订了几项分水原则：（一）有利同享，有亏同吃（有水时大家用、缺水时大家平均少使）。（二）先尽熟地用，有余再浇新开的荒地。（三）反对不公平的旧水规，大家合理浇用。大家都同意了这几项原则，并根据这些原则按照各口岸的人口、户数、土地面积，重新订出关于使水量及使用时间的新方案，经大家一致同意后，共同签字保证执行。
    代表中虽然有的成分不纯，但经过这次会议，大部分代表有了新的认识。领导机关就把他们组织起来，当作政府的工作组，由县干部作组长，负责领导。由他们自己执行会议决议，并告诉他们执行步骤。大家对这工作都感到满意并有信心。
    各组回去后，先召开了乡村干部会议，打通了他们过去关于争水纠纷的错误思想；再开农会，使会员对新方案有了一致的认识；然后再开群众大会讨论执行的具体办法。这么一来，各地在三天多的时间内就顺利贯彻执行了新方案，有的地方还通过了不得破坏新方案的决议和惩罚条例。
    新方案刚开始执行，玉门的群众就自动的在川北镇淘泉挖井，使水源旺流，以供下游的安西群众浇地。二百多年的水利纠纷，从此就为合作互助的行动所消灭了。
