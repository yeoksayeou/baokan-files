　　A Record of the Ethnic Minorities Cultural Relics Exhibition
　　Sifang
　　The Chinese Ethnic Minorities Cultural Relics Exhibition, sponsored by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, began on June 26th at the History Museum. Since then, many individuals and groups have visited. From the comments left by many visitors, it is clear that everyone has gained a rather deep impression.

　　The exhibition displays a total of over one thousand cultural relics and related pictures from dozens of ethnic minorities, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, and Gaoshan.

　　The Virtue of Loving Labor Through pictures and objects, we can see that the people of all brotherly ethnic groups possess the virtue of loving labor. Look, the brothers of the Yami tribe of the Gaoshan people are using their simple tools to build boats; the women of the Bunun tribe are weaving cloth on simple looms among their children; the Tibetan brothers are using their strong physical strength to transport heavy timber; the Miao brothers are wading across rope bridges... These all illustrate how each brotherly ethnic group is diligently living and struggling arduously against the high mountains, steep peaks, deserts, and Gobi under the local natural and social conditions. This also illustrates the importance of Article 53 of the Common Program of the CPPCC, which stipulates that "the People's Government should help the people of all ethnic minorities to develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings."

　　Remarkable Wisdom At the exhibition, we can also see the wisdom and artistic genius of the various brotherly ethnic groups. The 18th-century textiles of the Tibetan and Uyghur people had already reached a considerably high level in terms of weaving techniques and color coordination; the ivory carvings of the Hui people's Wang Zhian are extraordinarily exquisite. The costumes of the various brotherly ethnic groups are mostly quite beautiful. Almost all the objects at the exhibition, regardless of size, have uniform patterns and designs on them, some of which are very delicate and some are very bold. On the other hand, the entertainment life of the various brotherly ethnic groups also reflects their wisdom and artistic genius. The songs and dances of the Uyghur and Uzbek people, and the dances and music of the Miao and Yi people, are all very beautiful. In the past, the wisdom and artistic genius of the various brotherly ethnic groups were suppressed by the reactionary rulers and had no opportunity to develop. From now on, on the basis of political and economic development, their cultural and artistic life will surely blossom more brilliantly.

　　Heroic Revolutionary Spirit We can also see the excellent traditions and revolutionary spirit that exist in the lives of ethnic minorities, such as the autonomous movement launched by the people of Inner Mongolia against the rule of the Kuomintang; the heroic struggle of the people in the three districts of Ili, Altai, and Tarbagatai in Xinjiang against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Among the cultural relics of the Hui people, there are also historical materials about the Hui people's uprising in 1856 and the subsequent 21 years, as well as photos of the heroic sacrifice of Ma Benqi, commander of the former Hebei Central Hui People's Detachment against Japan, and Bai Zhenwu, the detachment leader. These are all glorious pages in the history of the Chinese People's Revolution.

　　Embarking on a New Life Today, with the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, all ethnic minorities have begun a new life under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party. Materials related to the life of the Mongolian brothers point out a path of development for all our ethnic minority brothers. Among the exhibition materials, there are pictures of various productions in Inner Mongolia since 1947, as well as photos, charts, and graphs of various political activities and social constructions since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government in 1949. From these charts, we can see the enormous development of various construction works in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Politically, all levels of government have undergone democratic elections, and people's representative conferences have been held in many banners and counties. Land reform has been completed in agricultural areas. New and improved agricultural tools have been adopted in agriculture, and agricultural technology has been improved. In the five leagues in eastern Inner Mongolia, the cultivated land increased by 78,984 ching in 1949 compared to the previous year. In animal husbandry, the livestock breeding rate has increased due to the emphasis on wolf control and epidemic prevention. Inner Mongolia now has 4.4 million heads of livestock. In 1950, Inner Mongolia's finances had eliminated the deficit. And a large amount of investment and loans have been made in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. At the same time, cultural education and medical and health undertakings have also been gradually developed. There are currently more than 3,800 primary schools in Inner Mongolia. We see the happy lives of Inner Mongolian children in nurseries.

　　The cultural relics collected for this exhibition are very limited. They are far from reflecting the overall life of the various brotherly ethnic groups. The Nationalities Affairs Commission is considering preparing to establish a permanent ethnic museum on the basis of this exhibition, in order to further promote mutual understanding and mutual respect among the various ethnic groups, and to exchange the cultures of the various ethnic groups.

　　记少数民族文物展览会
    四方
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会主办的中国少数民族文物展览会，于六月二十六日借历史博物馆开始展览以来，前往参观的个人和团体颇多。从许多人士参观后所留下的意见中，可以知道大家都获得了相当深刻的印象。
    展览会陈列了蒙、藏、回、维、苗、彝、高山等数十个少数民族的文物及有关图片共一千余件。
    爱劳动的美德  通过图片与器物，我们可以知道各兄弟民族的人民大众是有着爱劳动的美德的。看吧，高山族中的耶美部落的兄弟们，正使用着他们简单的工具在造船；葡能部落的妇女在她的孩子群中用简单的织机织布；藏族兄弟以自己健壮的体力运载着笨重的木材；苗族兄弟挽渡着绳索桥；……这些，都说明了各兄弟民族在当地自然的和社会的条件下，是怎样勤劳地生活着，和高山、峻岭、漠野、戈壁艰苦地斗争着。这也说明了人民政协共同纲领第五十三条“人民政府应帮助各少数民族的人民大众发展其政治、经济、文化教育的建设事业”规定的重要性。
    卓越的智慧  在展览会上，我们又可以看到各兄弟民族的智慧和艺术天才。藏族和维族十八世纪的织品，在编织的技术和色调的配合上，就已经达到相当高的水准；回民王质安的象牙质雕刻，其精致是超乎寻常的。各兄弟民族的服饰，大都相当美丽。展览会上所有的器物，不管大小，上面差不多都有匀整的图案花纹，其中有的很细腻，有的很粗豪。另一方面，各兄弟民族的娱乐生活也表现了他们的智慧和艺术天才。维族和乌孜别克族的歌舞，苗、彝族的舞蹈和音乐，都是非常优美的。在过去，各兄弟民族的这些智慧和艺术天才，受了反动统治者的压制，没有发展的机会。从今以后，在政治和经济发展的基础上，他们的文化和艺术生活，必然会开出更灿烂的花朵。
    英勇的革命精神  我们又可以看到存在于少数民族生活中的优秀传统和革命精神，例如内蒙古人民反对国民党统治而发动的自治运动；新疆伊、阿、塔三区人民反对国民党反动派而进行的英勇斗争。在回族的文物中，还有一八五六年及其以后二十一年间回民起义的史料，又有关于回民抗日英雄前冀中回民支队司令员马本齐和支队长白振武两同志壮烈牺牲的照片。这些，都是中国人民革命史上光辉的篇页。
    走上了新的生活  今天，随着中国人民革命的胜利，各少数民族在人民政府和共产党的领导下开始新的生活了。蒙族兄弟生活的一部分材料，很好地替我们全体少数民族兄弟指出了一个发展的道路。展览的材料中，有一九四七年以来内蒙古各种生产的图片以及一九四九年内蒙自治区人民政府成立以来各项政治活动和社会建设的照片、图表等。从这些图表上，我们可以看出内蒙自治区各方面建设工作的巨大发展。在政治上，各级政权都经过了民主选举，并在不少的旗县内开了人民代表会议。农业区已完成了土改。农业方面采用了新式的和改良的农具，提高了农业技术。内蒙东部五个盟，在一九四九年比前一年就增加了耕地七万八千九百八十四埫。牧畜业方面，因为注重打狼和防疫的结果，牲畜繁殖率提高了，现在内蒙已有了牲畜四百四十万头。一九五○年内蒙财政已消灭赤字。并对工农牧业进行了大量的投资与贷款。同时，文化教育和医药卫生等事业也逐步发展起来了。内蒙现有小学三千八百多所。我们看到内蒙儿童在托儿所内愉快的生活情形。
    这次展览会所搜集到的文物是很有限的。远不能反映各兄弟民族的全面生活。民族事务委员会正在考虑以这次展览为基础，筹备成立一个永久性的民族博物馆，以便更进一步促进各民族之间的相互了解、相互尊重，并交流各民族的文化。
