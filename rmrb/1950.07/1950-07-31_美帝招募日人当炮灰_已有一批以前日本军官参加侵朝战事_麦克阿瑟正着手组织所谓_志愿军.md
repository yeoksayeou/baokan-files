　　US Imperialism Recruits Japanese as Cannon Fodder
    A Number of Former Japanese Officers Have Participated in the Korean War
    MacArthur is Preparing to Organize a So-Called "Volunteer Army"
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 30th] TASS reported from Hong Kong on the 29th, citing a report from the Denpō News Agency: A number of former Japanese officers have directly participated in the Korean War. At the same time, MacArthur is beginning to establish a so-called "volunteer army" based on former officers and soldiers of the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Japanese Army stationed in Korea, and officers of the former Japanese General Staff Headquarters.
    Japanese officers participating in the Korean War under American command include Lieutenant General Yamaoka Michitaki (transliteration), Lieutenant General Doi, and Colonel Otani Etsuo.
    Lieutenant Colonel Yamazaki, former head of the China Department of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, and Hara Zenichiro (transliteration), former head of the Soviet Department, have been dispatched to Korea by MacArthur's staff as "military and political experts." Former Japanese Vice Admiral Maeda Minoru is an advisor to the American fleet blockading the Korean coast.
    It is reported that MacArthur has ordered the recruitment in Japan of a so-called "volunteer army" to invade Korea. According to Tokyo sources, in the past few days, 8,000 former officers and soldiers of the Japanese armed forces have been recruited in Fukuoka, and special attention is being paid to recruiting this army in northern Kyushu Island, which is closest to Korea.
    Activities to recruit the so-called "volunteer army" are also being carried out among unemployed workers in industrial areas and among former Japanese prisoners of war repatriated from the Soviet Union. The so-called "Russian Department" of MacArthur's headquarters, headed by former White Russian officer Glay, has compiled a detailed list of former Japanese prisoners of war.

    麦克阿瑟正着手组织所谓“志愿军”
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社二十九日讯：据电通社香港记者报道：有一批以前的日本军官，已直接参加了朝鲜的作战。同时，麦克阿瑟正开始成立由以前日本关东军、日本驻朝鲜军的官兵和以前日本参谋本部的军官们为基础的所谓“志愿军”。
    日本军官在美国人管辖之下参加朝鲜作战的已有山冈道泷（译音）中将、土井中将和小谷悦男大佐。
    前日本参谋本部中国部主任山崎中佐和苏联部主任原全一郎（译音）已被麦克阿瑟参谋部作为“军事、政治专家”派往朝鲜。前日本海军中将前田实是执行封锁朝鲜海岸的美国舰队的顾问。
    据闻：麦克阿瑟又命令在日本招募侵略朝鲜的所谓“志愿军”。根据东京消息：过去几天在福冈已招募了以前日本武装部队的官兵八千人，并特别注意在离朝鲜最近的九州岛北部进行招募这批军队。
    在工业区的失业工人中，在苏联遣送回来的以前日本战俘中，也在进行招募所谓“志愿军”的活动。由以前的白卫军军官格莱所主持的所谓麦克阿瑟总部的“俄国处”，已把以前的日本战俘详细地开了名单。
