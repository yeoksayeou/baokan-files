　　The German Democratic Republic is an Important Factor in Consolidating Peace

    Readers of *Pravda*—Fominykh (Kirov City), Otchinsky (Voroshilovgrada Oblast, Chetovo Station), and others—request an explanation of the significance of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in the struggle for peace.

    Comrade Stalin said in his congratulatory telegram to Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, and Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic: "The establishment of a democratic and peace-loving German Republic marks a turning point in European history."

    Until today, German history has known only reactionary and militaristic governments. For centuries, power in Germany belonged to the most aggressive elements of the exploiting classes.

    After Germany's defeat in World War I and the collapse of the autocratic regime, power within the country remained in the hands of monopoly capital and the aristocracy. In 1933, they established a government headed by Hitler and established a reactionary and bloody fascist system in Germany.

    In the past hundred years, Germany's reactionary rulers have launched a series of wars. In the summer of 1941, they completed one of the greatest crimes of their sins, treacherously attacking the Soviet Union.

    The destruction of Hitler's Germany, resulting from the glorious victory of the Soviet army, opened the way for the German people to move towards peace, freedom, and democracy.

    Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl declared on the fifth anniversary of Germany's liberation: "Therefore, today we thank the Soviet Union, Marshal Stalin, and the many Soviet soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the struggle to liberate us from fascism and for the progress of mankind."

    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic marks the first time in the history of the German people that a truly democratic and peace-loving government has been established.

    In 1945, the Potsdam Conference stipulated the principles of reforming Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country.

    Only the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to these democratic principles. In the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany, thorough democratic reforms are being carried out in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. In the summer of 1945, the organization and activities of various democratic parties, trade unions, and other democratic social organizations were permitted. In the Soviet zone of occupation, local self-government organs and local governments have been established on a broad democratic basis. The land reform implemented in the autumn of 1945 completely eradicated the reactionary semi-feudal aristocratic landlord class in the Soviet zone of occupation. Monopoly capital was eliminated precisely and unswervingly in accordance with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference.

    The Soviet government has always consistently striven for the most rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of occupation forces. The Soviet government has put forward suggestions regarding an all-German democratic government that can sign a peace treaty and ensure Germany's development along a democratic path.

    However, this proposal was met with fierce opposition from the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. Immediately after the war, American imperialists took measures to turn West Germany into their colony and war base, and to use the German people as cannon fodder for future aggression. The imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France violated the Potsdam Agreement and supported the most reactionary elements in West Germany. They undermined land reform in the German occupation zones and carefully supported and nurtured German monopoly capital.

    Even during the war, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France began preparing to dismember Germany. As is well known, the controllers of British and American policy at the time formally proposed dividing Germany into three or five regions.

    Thereafter, at the Potsdam Conference, the US and British governments attempted to further create a de facto division of Germany under its federal form. The Soviet government's firm opposition to this reactionary conspiracy prevented the Western imperialists from unfolding this policy in all of Germany. Later, the United States and Britain created a joint colonial occupation zone, completed the division of Germany, and established a puppet Bonn "government" composed of Wall Street agents in the West German occupation zone.

    As is well known, on the eve of World War II, the imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France tried their best to turn the German army against the Soviet Union. Now—in a new situation—the United States, Britain, and France are trying their best to turn West Germany into their tool of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. To this end, an alliance has been concluded between American monopoly capitalists and Ruhr industrial capitalists.

    However, this calculation does not include the German people, who are eager for peace.

    The British and American policy of splitting Germany has met with firm opposition from the Soviet Union. Even during the war, Comrade Stalin declared: "...Hitlers come and go, but the German nation, the German state, remains." The Soviet policy of leading to the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany stems from this wise instruction. The Soviet government resolutely rejected all plans to split Germany and the cannibalistic theories of the American rulers who planned to eliminate the German people. In this regard, Comrade Stalin declared in his historic message to the people on the day of victory over the German invaders: "The Soviet Union is celebrating its triumph, although it does not intend to dismember Germany, nor does it intend to destroy Germany."

    This policy promoted the consolidation of democratic forces in Germany. It liberated the powerful democratic forces of the German people.

    The Soviet government believed that "it is impossible not to recognize the desire of German democratic groups to establish a unified Germany on a democratic and peace-loving basis as legitimate." General Chuikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, said in a statement at the founding of the German Democratic Republic: "The Soviet government resolutely transfers the administrative powers hitherto belonging to the Soviet Military Administration to the provisional government of the German Democratic Republic." A Soviet Control Committee was established to replace the Soviet Military Administration. This Control Committee has the task of supervising the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and other four-power agreements relating to Germany.

    Due to the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the German people's struggle for the unification and democratization of their country has entered a new stage. It erects an important obstacle in the path of imperialists attempting to use Germany for their dark deeds and turn Germany into a tool of their aggressive policies.

    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic consolidates democratic forces in the largest country in Western Europe and is the greatest contribution to the entire cause of peace. New relations based on mutual respect for national sovereignty and the interests of all parties between a peace-loving Germany and democratic countries have replaced the former hostility. The changes that have taken place in these relations indicate a profound historical transformation in Europe's development.

    The German people's struggle for peace is rising and expanding widely. The German working people are uniting more closely in an organized peace front against the warmongers. In particular, this is confirmed by the fifteen million citizens of the German Democratic Republic who have signed the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace; the success of the peace declaration signature campaign in West Germany also confirms this, despite all the obstacles created by the British and American imperialists and their German lackeys. All of this shows the firm determination of German people's democratic groups to fight for peace. Comrade Stalin once said: If the Soviet people and the German people show the same determination in the fight for peace as they did in the war, then peace in Europe can be guaranteed.

    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic confirms the German people's hope to unite their strength with the strength of the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a serious blow to the camp of war provocateurs.

    Comrade Stalin instructed: "There is no doubt that the coexistence of a peace-loving and democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes new wars in Europe impossible, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries."

    On the fifth anniversary of the German people's liberation from fascist tyranny, Comrade Stalin expressed this confidence in his reply to Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic: "The friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union will further successfully promote the happiness of our people, the interests of peace, and the cooperation of all peace-loving countries."

    Recently, at the request of the government of the German Democratic Republic and with the consent of the government of the Republic of Poland, the Soviet government decided to reduce the remaining amount of reparations by 50 percent and allow a 15-year extension for repayment. Comrade Stalin notified the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic of this decision on May 15th of this year. This action by the Soviet government is new evidence of the friendly relations established between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, and is new evidence of the Soviet government's desire to alleviate the German people's burden in revitalizing and developing the strength of the German national economy.

### 德意志民主共和国是巩固和平的重要因素

　　德意志民主共和国是巩固和平的重要因素
    《真理报》读者佛米内赫（基洛夫城）、欧秦斯基（沃罗希洛夫拉拉省、切脱沃站）等要求解释德意志民主共和国的成立在争取和平斗争中的意义。
    斯大林同志在致德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克及德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥贺电中说：德意志民主的，爱好和平的共和国的成立就是欧洲历史的转折点。
    直到今日为止，德国的历史仅知道反动的和军国主义的政府。几个世纪来，德国的政权是属于剥削阶级的最具侵略性的分子。
    第一次世界大战德国败北和专制政体崩溃后，国内的政权仍握在垄断资本和贵族之手。一九三三年，他们曾建立起以希特勒为首的政府，而且在德国树立起反动的，血腥的法西斯制度。
    近百年间，德国反动的统治者们曾发动了一系列的战争。一九四一年夏季，他们完成了自己罪恶中一个最大的罪行、背信地进攻苏联。
    由于苏联军队光辉胜利的结果而发生的希特勒德国的灭亡，为德国人民开辟了迈向和平，自由和民主的道路。
    奥托·格罗提渥总理在庆祝德国解放五周年纪念日曾宣称：“因此，我们今天感谢苏联，斯大林大元帅和在争取从法西斯中解放我们的和争取人类进步的斗争中牺牲的许多苏军战士”。
    德意志民主共和的成立标志着：在今天，真正民主的，爱好和平的政府在德国人民历史中首次成立了。
    一九四五年，在波茨坦会议上规定了把德国变为爱好和平的，民主的国家的改革原则。
    只有苏联始终不渝地遵守这些民主原则。在德国苏联占领区，依据波茨坦协定原则进行着彻底的民主改革。已于一九四五年夏季，允许各民主政党，职工会和其他民主社会团体的组织与活动。在苏联占领区，地方自治机关和地方政府在广泛的民主基础上已建立起来。一九四五年秋季所实行的土地改革，完全铲除了苏联占领区的反动的半封建的贵族地主阶级。确切不移地依据波茨坦会议的决定铲除了垄断资本。
    苏联政府过去与现在始终如一地力求最迅速的缔结对德和约和撤退占领军。苏联政府曾提出了关于能够签订和约和保证遵循民主道路发展德国的全德民主政府的建议。
    但是，这个建议遭到了美、英、法各国政府方面的激烈的反对。美国帝国主义者们在战后立即采取把西德变为自己的殖民地和战争基地，把德国人民作为未来侵略的炮灰的手段。美、英、法各帝国主义者们违反了波茨坦协定，扶植西德最反动的分子。他们在德国的占领区内破坏了土地改革和小心地扶持和养育德国垄断资本。
    还在战争期间，美、英、法三国政府已开始准备肢解德国。如所周知，英、美政策的掌握者们当时曾正式提出关于划分德国为三个或五个区域的提议。
    此后，波茨坦会议的时候，美、英政府曾企图在它的联邦化形式下进一步造成事实上分割德国。苏联政府对于这个反动的阴谋所给与的坚决反对，使西方帝国主义者们在全德不能展开这个政策。后来美、英造成了殖民地的联合占领区，完成了德国的分裂，在西德占领区内建立了一个由华尔街代理者所组成的傀儡波恩“政府”。
    如所周知，第二次世界大战前夜，美、英、法各帝国主义者们尽力使德国军队反对苏联。现在——在新形势中——美、英、法尽力把西德变成自己反对苏联和人民民主国家的侵略工具。为此，又缔结了美国垄断资本家和鲁尔工业资本家之间的联盟。
    但是，这个计算没有德国人民参加的，德国人民却是渴望着和平的。
    英、美分裂德国的政策获得了苏联的坚决反对。还在战争期间，斯大林同志曾宣称：“……希特勒之流会上台也就会下台，而德意志民族，德意志国家则依然是存在的。”。引向建立统一的，民主的，爱好和平的德国的苏联政策，即出于这个智慧的指示。苏联政府坚决地拒绝一切分裂德国的计划和计算消灭德国人民的美国统治者的吃人理论。关于这一点，斯大林同志在战胜德寇胜利日对人民发表的历史性的文告中宣称：“苏联在庆祝凯旋，虽然它并不打算瓦解德国，也不打算消灭德国”。
    这个政策促进了德国民主力量的巩固。它解放了德国人民强有力的民主力量。
    苏联政府曾认为：“不能不承认德国民主团体在民主与爱好和平的基础上建立统一的德国的愿望为合法的”。德国苏联军政府总督崔可夫将军在德国民主共和国成立时的声明中这样说：“苏联政府坚决地把迄今属于苏联军政府的行政职权移交德国民主共和国的临时政府”。建立苏联管制委员会——这个管制委员会有任务监督执行波茨坦和有关德国的其他四国协议——以代替苏联军政府。
    由于德国民主共和国的成立，使德国人民争取自己国家的统一与民主化的斗争已步入了一个新阶段。它在帝国主义者们企图利用德国进行自己黑暗勾当和把德国变为自己侵略政策工具的道路上，树立起重要的障碍。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，巩固着西欧最大国家中的民主力量，是整个和平事业中最大的贡献。在爱好和平的德国和民主国之间的基于互相尊重国家主权和任何一方面利益的新关系，代替了昔日的敌视。在这些关系中所发生的改变，指出欧洲发展中深刻的历史性的转变。
    德国人民参加的争取和平的斗争，正在高涨着和广泛地展开着。德国劳动人民愈紧密地团结在反对战争贩子的有组织的和平阵线中了。特别是，在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会宣言上已签了名的一千五百万德国民主共和国的公民证实着这件事；尽管英、美帝国主义者们和他们的德国走卒们作出一切障碍，可是在西德和平宣言签名运动的成功也证实这件事。所有这些，说明德国人民民主团体为和平而斗争的坚固决心。斯大林同志曾说过：如果苏维埃人民和德国人民以象他们作战时那样奋力表示出争取和平战斗的坚决性，那么欧洲的和平是能够得到保证的。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，证实了德国人民希望在争取和平斗争中把自己的力量与以苏联所领导的民主阵营的力量团结在一起。德意志民主共和国的成立，对于战争挑拨者阵营是一个严重的打击。
    斯大林同志曾指示：“无可怀疑，爱和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血，并使世界帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能”。
    斯大林同志于德国人民从法西斯暴政解放出来的五周年纪念日，在回答德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥时曾表示这样信心：“在德国民主共和国和苏联之间的友爱关系，将进一步成功地促进我们人民的幸福，和平的利益和一切爱好和平国家的合作”。
    最近，苏联政府依据德意志民主共和国政府的请求，征得了波兰共和国政府的同意，决定减少剩余的赔款额的百分之五十，并允许延期十五年还清。关于这个决定，斯大林同志在今年五月十五日曾通知德意志民主共和国总理。苏联政府的这种行动，是在苏联和德意志民主共和国之间所树立起来的友好关系的新证据，是苏联政府希望减轻德国人民在复兴和发展德国国民经济力量的新证据。
