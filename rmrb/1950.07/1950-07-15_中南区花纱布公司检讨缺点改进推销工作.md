　　Central and Southern China Textile Company Reviews Shortcomings and Improves Promotion Work

[Hankou News, this newspaper] To further improve promotion work and adjust the relationship between public and private sectors, the Central and Southern China Textile Company held a joint meeting of the heads of finished product (yarn and cloth) sections of its branch companies in June, where it conducted a deep review of past shortcomings and thoroughly discussed future business guidelines.

Since March this year, the company has vigorously launched promotion efforts, and has established institutions in all major large and medium-sized yarn and cloth markets in the region (Guangxi is in preparation). So far, 32 promotion units including branch companies, offices, and wholesale departments have been established, and sales relationships have been established with 74 cooperatives and public and private shops. This has played a significant role in recovering currency and stabilizing prices, causing cotton yarn prices to gradually rise from 4.8 million yuan on April 26th, stabilizing to the standard price of 5.6 to 5.65 million yuan. The company's turnover has also increased with the stabilization of prices and the increasing recovery of real purchasing power; cotton yarn sales in May were 282 percent higher than in April, and cotton cloth sales were 134 percent higher in May than in April.

		Lack of initiative in business operations, large quantities of goods unable to be sold

However, because this work has not been carried out for long, many places have not done enough, and some have even deviated, resulting in a backlog of goods. For example, the branch companies in Henan and Hubei provinces have focused on cotton procurement and treated yarn and cloth promotion as a sideline. Eighty to ninety percent of the cadres in the finished products section of the Zhengzhou branch company are recent graduates. Branch companies such as Lingbao, Nanyang, Shangqiu, Yuekou, Fancheng, and Shadaoguan either lack dedicated cadres or have cadres who are also holding other positions. Those cadres responsible for promotion adopted a "Jiang Taigong fishing" attitude, waiting for customers to come to them, without taking the initiative or thinking of ways to sell the goods. As a result, brand-name goods sold well, while second-rate and slow-moving goods piled up in warehouses. When wholesale departments could not be established, they were afraid to entrust private merchants as sales agents, only emphasizing the "high risk" without thinking of ways to prevent risk. Later, when the goods could not be sold, they resorted to indiscriminate entrustment of sales agencies, without investigating sales volumes, signing contracts, or assessing the strength of the other party. The Guangzhou branch company blindly allocated goods based on a single statement from the Provincial Department of Commerce, and the sales figures from various locations were not known for nearly two months. It allocated 2,000 bolts of cloth to the Xijiang Trading Company, and only one bolt was sold for a long time. The Changsha branch company transported goods to trade companies in Liling and Xiangtan counties, and some have sold only a few bolts to date, while others have not sold any. The Guangzhou Department Store accepted the entrustment and then sub-entrusted private shops as sales agents. The Zhengzhou branch company hung up signs of "Retail Department" at two sales agencies, causing public and private sectors to be mixed up. Bureaucratic work style is mainly reflected in cumbersome procedures. The company had to go through nearly ten procedures from transaction to delivery, and some branch companies could not even deliver the goods on the same day. In the past, the Zhengzhou Wholesale Department even operated according to government office hours. The Shashi branch company did not operate during the rectification of cadres' thinking.

		Organize private capital to invest in the interior, focusing on supporting cooperative undertakings

In response to the above-mentioned shortcomings, the meeting decided that the most important thing in the future is to completely eliminate the conservative idea of "doing business at the door," and strive to achieve success by selling more slow-moving goods. Secondly, procedures must be simplified. Gradually achieve large wholesale transactions with tax payment, packaging, warehousing, and transportation all handled by the company. Small wholesale transactions (in wholesale departments) should learn from private shops, and establish a "running the streets" system to actively promote goods, and widely expand entrusted sales agency business, signing contracts based on the principles of trustworthiness and salability. Thirdly, implement a quota-based promotion system, designating business personnel to manage five to seven sales agents each, and assigning them certain tasks. Fourthly, stop mobile promotion, carrying cloth to the countryside, mail-order sales, and retail businesses of less than one bolt, and vigorously organize private capital in the yarn and cloth industry to invest in transportation to the interior, striving to connect urban and rural economies. Fifthly, focus on areas where land reform has been implemented, and in conjunction with relevant parties, support the establishment and growth of rural cooperatives.

		Appropriately adjust price differences to guarantee reasonable profits for private merchants

Finally, the meeting focused on discussing the issue of public-private relations. It criticized the old concept of "no merchant is not cunning," as well as the over-leftist and over-rightist views and practices of only uniting without struggling or only struggling without uniting with private businesses. It was unanimously recognized that the crux of the uncoordinated public-private relationship lies in the control of prices. Therefore, it was decided that in the future, efforts should be made to: flexibly control market supply and demand, adjust the price gap between large wholesale (yarn, one piece or more; cloth, 20 bolts or more) and small wholesale, conduct detailed surveys of transportation costs and taxes based on natural areas and transportation conditions, and set regional price differences, and accurately calculate profits and interest, so that private businesses can obtain reasonable profits in legitimate operations.

　　中南区花纱布公司检讨缺点改进推销工作
    【本报汉口讯】中南区花纱布公司为进一步搞好推销工作，调整公私关系，在六月中所召开之分支公司成品（纱布）科长联席会议上，曾对过去缺点加以深刻检讨，并详细研讨了今后的经营方针。
    该公司自今年三月份起即大力展开推销工作，全区主要大、中纱布市场都先后建立了机构（广西在筹备中）。截至目前为止，已成立了分支公司、办事处、批发部等三十二个推销单位，并与七十四个合作社及公、私营商店建立了代销关系。对回笼货币，稳定物价均起了很大作用，使棉纱价格从四月二十六日的四八○万元，逐渐提升，稳至五六○至五六五万元的标准价。该公司营业额也随着物价稳定、真实购买力的日益恢复而增加；棉纱五月份较四月多卖出百分之二百八十二，棉布销售数，五月份较四月份高出百分之一百三十四。
            业务经营缺乏主动大批货物推销不出
    但由于此一工作开展未久，许多地方做得不够甚至于发生偏差，而致货物积压，如：豫、鄂两省各分支公司向以收购棉花为主，视纱布推销为副业，郑州分公司的成品科干部十分之八九是刚从学校出来的学生。象灵宝、南阳、商邱、岳口、樊城、沙道观等支公司，有的缺少专管干部，有的还是兼任。在负责推销的干部又是拿出“姜太公钓鱼”的姿势等客上门，不主动，不想办法，结果是名牌子货倒好卖，次货、冷货堆满仓库。在批发部建立不起来时，找代销不敢委托私商，只是强调“风险大”，而不想办法防止风险。到后来货卖不出去了，就来个一把抓的委托代销，不调查销售数量，不签订合同，不看对方力量，广州分公司就凭省商业厅的一句话盲目拨货，各地卖的数字快两个月了还不知道，拨西江贸易公司布二千匹，很长日子才卖一匹，长沙分公司运货到醴陵、湘潭等县贸易公司，到现在有的卖了几匹，有的没卖。广州百货公司接受了委托又转托私营商店代销，郑州分公司把两个代销店挂上门市部的招牌，弄得公私混杂。机关化作风主要的表现在手续麻烦上，该公司从成交到出货要经过近十道手续，有的分支公司当天货物还不能出仓。过去郑州批发部甚至按政府办公时间作息。沙市分公司整顿干部思想时不营业。
            组织私资投向内地重点扶植合作事业
    会议针对上述缺点，决定今后首先要彻底摧毁“作上门买卖”的保守思想，从多销冷货中争取成绩。其次，要简化手续。逐步做到大批发交易代办税捐，代办包装，出仓和运送，小批发交易（在批发部）向私营商店学习，并建立跑街制度主动推销货物，广泛展开委托代销业务，在讲信用与卖得掉的原则下订立合同。第三，实行定额推销制，指定业务人员，每人管理五至七个代销店，分配一定任务，第四，流动推销，背布下乡，通信兜售及匹以下零售业务停止，大力组织纱布业的私人资本投向内地贩运，为沟通城乡经济关系而努力。第五，以已实行土改的区域为重点，结合有关方面，扶植农村合作社的建立和壮大。
            适当调整货物差价保障私商合理利润
    最后，会议着重讨论了公私关系问题。批判过去“无商不奸”的旧观念，以及对私营商业只团结不斗争或只斗争不团结的过左过右的看法和作法。并一致认识到公私关系不协调的症结在于价格掌握上。所以决定今后要做到：灵活市场吞吐，调整大批发（纱、件以上，布、二十匹以上）与小批发之间的价格距离，按自然区与交通条件详细调查运缴费用订定地区差价，并精确计算利润、利息，使私营商业在正当经营中能获得合理利润。
