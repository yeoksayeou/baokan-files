　　Public Health Bureau Calls for Prevention of Encephalitis

　　[News from Beijing Municipal News Agency] According to statistics from the Municipal Public Health Bureau, from May to the 11th of this month, seven cases of encephalitis have been discovered in the city (none were discovered from January to April), of which six resulted in death. The Municipal Health Committee has therefore called on citizens to earnestly carry out summer sanitation work, fill in stagnant water pits, install mosquito prevention equipment, and strive to prevent and eliminate mosquitoes to prevent the continued occurrence of encephalitis.

　　Encephalitis is a very dangerous infectious disease with a high mortality rate, and there is currently no effective treatment. Symptoms include fatigue, headache, fever, and sleepiness, and death can occur within two to three days of onset. The vector for transmitting encephalitis is mosquitoes, so mosquito prevention and elimination are necessary to prevent the occurrence of encephalitis.

　　公共卫生局号召 
    预防大脑炎
    【京市新闻处讯】据市公共卫生局统计：从本年五月到本月十一日止本市已发现大脑炎患者七人（一至四月未发现），其中死亡六人。市卫生委员会为此特号召市民切实做好夏季卫生工作，填平积水坑，布置防蚊设备，努力防蚊灭蚊，不使孑孓繁殖，以防止大脑炎的继续发生。
    大脑炎是一种很危险的传染病，死亡率很大，目前尚无特效治疗办法。病症为倦怠、头痛、发烧、贪睡，发病后两三日即可死亡。传染大脑炎的媒介是蚊子，必须防蚊灭蚊才能防止大脑炎的发生。
