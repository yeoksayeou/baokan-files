　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th: TASS, Moscow, July 7th: On July 4th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the following note from the U.S. Embassy: "The Ambassador of the United States of America presents his compliments to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and, upon instruction, has the honor to inform His Excellency that the President of the United States of America, pursuant to the request of the United Nations Security Council to support the Republic of Korea in repelling the aggressors from North Korea and restoring peace in Korea, has ordered the Navy to blockade the coast of Korea. The blockade takes effect immediately."
　　On July 6th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented a note to the U.S. Embassy, which stated: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has received the Embassy's note of July 4th of this year and, on the instructions of the Soviet Government, has the honor to declare as follows: In the aforementioned note, the Embassy stated that the President of the United States of America, citing the Security Council's resolution on the Korean issue, has ordered the Navy to blockade the coast of Korea.
　　The Soviet Government, in its reply of June 29th to Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated that the aforementioned Security Council resolution on the Korean issue was passed in violation of the United Nations Charter, has no legal force, and therefore cannot serve as a legal basis for taking any measures against Korea—including the naval blockade of the Korean coast.
　　The blockade of Korea is a new act of aggression. This blockade, like the entire armed intervention of the United States in Korea, runs counter to the principles of the United Nations.
　　In view of the foregoing considerations, the Soviet Government considers that the Government of the United States of America shall be responsible for all the consequences of this act and for all losses to Soviet interests that may result from the enforcement of the aforementioned blockade."

　　苏联政府驳复美照会
　　声明美海军封锁朝鲜为非法   
    这一行动的一切后果应由美政府负责
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：七月四日，苏联外交部从美国大使馆接获照会如下：“美利坚合众国大使向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部部长致意，并遵照训令，很荣幸地通知贵部长：美利坚合众国总统依照联合国安全理事会支持大韩民国击退北朝鲜侵略者并恢复朝鲜和平的请求，已下令海军封锁朝鲜海岸。封锁立即生效。”
    七月六日，苏联外交部向美国大使馆提出照会，内容如下：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部已接获贵大使馆今年七月四日的照会，现奉苏联政府之命，很荣幸地作如下声明：在上述照会中，贵大使馆通知称：美利坚合众国总统已援引安全理事会关于朝鲜问题的决议，下令海军封锁朝鲜海岸。
    苏联政府于六月二十九日答复联合国秘书长赖伊先生的信函时便已声明：上述安理会关于朝鲜问题的决议，是违反联合国宪章而通过的，没有任何法律效力，因而不能作为对朝鲜采取任何措施——包括海军封锁朝鲜海岸——的法律根据。
    封锁朝鲜是新的侵略行为。这一封锁正像美国对朝鲜的全部武装干涉一样，是与联合国的原则背道而驰的。
    由于上述各节，苏联政府将认为美利坚合众国政府应对这一行为的一切后果及可能因施行上述封锁而对苏联利益造成的全部损失负责。”
