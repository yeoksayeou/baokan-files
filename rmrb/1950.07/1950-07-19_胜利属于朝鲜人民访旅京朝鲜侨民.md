　　Victory Belongs to the Korean People: An Interview with Korean Residents in Beijing
　　Bai Sheng
　　Amidst the continuous victories of the Korean people's anti-aggression war, this reporter made a special visit to three Korean residents living in Beijing: Mr. Kim Myung-hwan, a Korean doctor, and his wife, Ms. Kim Kyu-ok, and Ms. Kang Chae-soon (Kang Shin-ja), a teacher at the Korean People's Elementary School in Beijing. They are all from North Korea. Mr. Kim and his wife have been in Beijing for many years, and Kang Chae-soon came from the Northeast after the liberation of Beijing. Mrs. Kim translated our conversation. Her Chinese is extremely fluent, making this visit particularly cordial.
　　"Our people in our homeland are engaged in an unprecedented heroic and righteous struggle. These days, the hundred or so Korean residents in Beijing have felt an unprecedented excitement and fervor. Whenever we meet, we talk about the victory of the war, the unification of the motherland, defeating Syngman Rhee, and driving the American imperialists out of Korea. The land of Korea belongs to the Korean people, and we will never allow the aggression of American imperialism," Mr. Kim and Mrs. Kim expressed their feelings with excitement.
　　"Yes, all the Korean people know that although the Syngman Rhee traitor has the help of American imperialism, we are not afraid of them. Syngman Rhee's delusion of occupying Pyongyang within three days was a gross misjudgment of the power of the people. He doesn't know that the power of the people is many times stronger than American weapons. He considers American money and American weapons too omnipotent. But what are the facts? In just three weeks, he was beaten by the brave People's Army and has no strength left," added Ms. Kang Chae-soon, the teacher.
　　Speaking of the crimes of American imperialism and Syngman Rhee in South Korea, Mr. Kim became indignant. He said that what happened in South Korea was the same as what they had personally witnessed in Beijing before liberation, the various atrocities of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries against the Chinese people. The people of South Korea do not even have the freedom to hold a meeting or put up a poster. They once heard of such a tragic event in Seoul. That was when American imperialism ruled South Korea and Seoul had not yet been liberated. One day, it was raining heavily, and a Korean professor and his wife were caught in the rain on the road. They were soaked all over. Just when they were helpless, they saw a car coming from afar. They happily waved, wanting to hitch a ride for a short distance, but when the car drove up to them, they were disappointed. It turned out to be an American military jeep. So they had to apologize politely and insisted on not taking the ride. But then a tragic event occurred. The cunning and shameless American soldiers actually pulled the professor's wife into the car. The professor rushed to pull his wife, but was pushed away by the American soldiers. Then the jeep drove away. This is one of the countless criminal facts of the American military in South Korea. Mr. Kim said angrily that the crimes of American imperialism in Korea are countless. The Korean people hate the American military to the bone.
　　Speaking of this, teacher Kang Chae-soon also said angrily that the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitor are shooting ordinary people everywhere in South Korea, raping women, and many progressive people have been killed by them. When students in schools go on strike, they close the schools. If anyone speaks justly, they put a red hat on you, saying you are a communist, and arrest you to suffer torture. In the rural areas of South Korea, farmers are suffering unprecedented persecution. Syngman Rhee, because he deeply hates the peace-loving and simple farmers who have connections with the heroic South Korean People's Guerrilla, has killed many innocent farmers. Farmers' wives have also been dragged away and raped, and after the rape, their breasts were cut off. Even innocent children had their eyes gouged out. However, the more the farmers are persecuted in this way, the more their hatred for American imperialism and Syngman Rhee increases. Many farmers bravely joined the guerrillas, vowing to avenge their families and fellow villagers. Seeing that the strength of the People's Guerrilla was getting stronger and stronger, Syngman Rhee more barbarously and shamelessly set fire to the places where the guerrillas appeared.
　　The Korean people will never forgive the crimes of American imperialism and Syngman Rhee. Every Korean firmly believes that American imperialism will definitely be driven out of Korea. The Korean people will resolutely fight American imperialism to the end for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Korean people completely believe in their own strength. The teacher said resolutely that under the battle banner of General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people will be more closely united. They know that victory belongs to them.
　　In December of the year before last, this Korean female teacher returned to the free motherland of North Korea, where she personally witnessed the vibrant new atmosphere of the motherland. Factories were established in the cities, land reform was implemented in the countryside, and the vast number of farmers began to live a happy life. She saw that all the people enthusiastically supported their leader, General Kim Il-sung. Under his leadership, the people were closely united, and the people and the government were so close. She personally saw how the people of the motherland loved their own People's Army. Even children who were just beginning to understand spoke bravely that when they grew up, they would definitely be heroic People's Army soldiers. Heroic stories of the People's Army and the guerrillas are circulating everywhere in the mouths of the Korean people. Yes, the People's Army of North Korea and the guerrillas of South Korea are as rich in iron-like discipline and organization as the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. They are an incomparably brave team that has grown up in battle. Every People's Army soldier deeply understands why they are fighting. They have the most valuable political qualities, and they are enthusiastic about political learning, so the political quality of the People's Army is very good.
　　The three Korean residents excitedly expressed that this time, the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, although it caused the greatest disaster to the Korean people, it also gave the American imperialists a heavy blow. American imperialism is bound to retreat. What made them extremely excited this time was that the people of the entire peaceful and democratic camp were watching the Korean people with sympathy and concern. "All the concern has given us great strength! We especially want to thank China and the Soviet Union for their great sympathy and encouragement!" they said enthusiastically. "Although we are so far away from our motherland, our hearts are closely connected to every Korean. Hearing the news of victory from the motherland makes us even more full of infinite confidence and strength. We, the peace-loving Korean people, are bound to stand up!"

　　胜利属于朝鲜人民访旅京朝鲜侨民
    柏生
    在朝鲜人民反侵略战争的连续胜利声中，记者特地访问了住在北京的三位朝鲜人士，就是朝鲜医生金明焕先生及其夫人金圭玉女士，和旅京朝鲜人民小学校的女教师姜彩顺（姜信子）女士。他们都是北朝鲜人，金先生和他的夫人来到北京已经多年了，姜彩顺是北京解放以后才从东北来的。我们的谈话由金夫人翻译。她的中国话极其流利，因此这次访问是特别感到亲切的。
    “我们祖国人民正在展开空前英勇的正义斗争，这些天来，我们住在北京的百余朝鲜侨民都感到从没有过的兴奋热烈，我们大家见面总是谈战争的胜利，祖国的统一以及打垮李承晚，把美帝撵出朝鲜去。朝鲜的土地是朝鲜人民自己的，我们决不容许美帝的侵略。”金先生和金夫人兴奋地表达了他们的心情。
    “是的，所有的朝鲜人民都知道李承晚卖国贼虽然有美帝帮助，但我们是不怕他们的，李承晚妄想三天之内就占领平壤，他真是错估了人民的力量。他不知道人民的力量是比美国武器要强大多少倍，他把美国的钱，美国的武器看得太万能了。然而事实呢，仅仅三星期他就被勇敢的人民军队打得没有什么力量了。”女教师姜彩顺接着说。
    谈到美帝和李承晚在南朝鲜的罪恶时，金先生愤慨起来。他说在南朝鲜发生的事情，和北京解放前他们在北京亲眼看到美帝和国民党反动派对中国人民的种种暴行是一样的。南朝鲜的人民，连开一个会、贴一张广告的自由都没有。他们曾经听到汉城发生过这样一件悲惨的事情。那是在美帝统治南朝鲜，汉城还没有解放的时候。有一天，雨落得很大，一对朝鲜教授夫妇被雨截住在路上，他们浑身都淋湿了，正在无可奈何时，看见远远地来了一辆汽车。他们欣喜地招着手，想搭坐这辆汽车借送他们走一段路，但是当汽车开到身前，他们失望了。原来这是一辆美军的小吉普车。于是他们只好很客气地道了一下歉，坚持着不坐。但这时悲惨的事件竟然发生了。狡猾无耻的美军，竟把那位教授太太一把拉上了车。教授赶上去拉他的妻子，却被美军推开。接着吉普车开走了。这就是美军在南朝鲜无数的罪恶事实之一。金先生愤愤地说，美帝在朝鲜的罪恶是数不清的。朝鲜人民对美军真是恨透了。
    说到这里，姜彩顺教师也愤愤地说，美帝国主义和李承晚卖国贼在南朝鲜到处枪杀老百姓，强奸妇女，多少进步人士被他们杀害了。学校里学生罢课，他们就封闭学校，谁说公正话，他们就给你扣上一顶红帽子，说你是共产党人，抓你去受酷刑。在南朝鲜乡村中，农民更遭受着空前的残害。李承晚因为深恨那些爱好和平的朴实的农民与英勇的南朝鲜人民游击队有联系，无辜地杀害了不少农民。农民的妻子也有被拉去强奸的，强奸后还把奶子割下来。甚至那些天真的孩子们也有被挖下眼睛的。然而农民们愈是这样受迫害，却愈增加了对美帝和李承晚的仇恨。许多农民都勇敢地参加了游击队，发誓要为他们的家人乡人报仇。李承晚见人民游击队的力量愈来愈强大了，就更野蛮无耻地把游击队出没的地方放火烧掉。
    美帝国主义和李承晚的罪恶是朝鲜人民绝不会饶恕的。每一个朝鲜人民都深深地相信美帝国主义一定会被打出朝鲜去的。朝鲜人民会为祖国的和平统一而坚决与美帝国主义斗争到底。朝鲜人民是完全相信自己的力量的。女教师决然地说，在金日成将军的战斗旗帜下，朝鲜人民将团结得更紧密，他们知道胜利是属于他们的。
    前年十二月里，这位朝鲜女教师曾经回到自由祖国的北朝鲜去，在那里她亲眼看到祖国活跃的新气象，城市里的工厂建立起来了，农村实行了土地改革，广大的农民开始过着幸福的生活。她看到所有的人民都热烈地拥护着他们的领袖金日成将军，人民在他的领导下，紧密的团结着，人民和政府是那么亲切。她亲眼看到祖国人民是怎样地热爱着他们自己的人民军。从刚懂事的孩子，就勇敢地讲着他大了一定要做一个英勇的人民军战士。在朝鲜人民的口中，到处流传着人民军和游击队的英勇故事。是的，北朝鲜的人民军和南朝鲜游击队是和伟大的中国人民解放军一样地富有钢铁般的纪律性和组织性，他们是从战斗里成长起来的一支英勇无比的队伍。每一个人民军战士都深深地懂得他们为什么而战，他们有着最宝贵的政治品质，他们热心于政治的学习，因此人民军的政治质量是非常良好的。
    三位朝鲜侨民激动地表示，这次美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争，虽然使朝鲜人民受到了最大的灾难，但也同样地给了美帝一个重重的打击，美帝是必然败退的。这次使他们感到极其振奋的是全世界和平民主阵营的人民都以同情和关心注视着朝鲜人民。“所有的关心都给了我们以极大的力量！我们特别要感谢中国和苏联的伟大同情与鼓励！”她们热情地说。“我们虽然离开祖国这样远，但我们的心却紧紧地和每一个朝鲜人民联系着，听到祖国胜利的捷音，更使我们充满了无限的信心和力量，我们爱好和平的朝鲜人民是一定要站起来的！”
