Xinhua News Agency, July 4th Dispatch from Moscow, TASS: Soviet newspapers all published special articles on the 2nd, commemorating the first anniversary of the death of Dimitrov, the outstanding revolutionary leader of proletarian internationalism.

    The "Izvestia" wrote: Dimitrov's heroic life, a life faithfully dedicated to revolutionary activities, inspires millions of men and women worldwide who are struggling against instigators of new wars and for peace, freedom, and national independence.

    The "People's Daily" reprinted an article entitled "Following Dimitrov's Path" written by Chervenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which was published in the journal "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!".

    Dimitrov's Quotations

    Fascism—that is war! (Fascism—that is war)

    It is not enough merely to hope for peace. It is also necessary to fight for peace. (United Front for the Struggle for Peace)

    To fight for peace is to fight against Fascism, to fight against capitalism, and thus to fight for the victory of socialism throughout the world. (United Front for the Struggle for Peace)

    Only a united proletariat can become the organizer of this peace front, the leading force and backbone of this front. Therefore, the central task of the proletariat of the whole world lies here. (United Front for the Struggle for Peace)

    If one does not first take all necessary measures to establish a united front of the working class in each country and unified action of international workers' organizations, one cannot seriously come out to maintain international peace. (Fascism—that is war)

    To expose and eliminate Fascist spies, assassins, saboteurs, and detectives in socialist countries strengthens the economic, political, and military power of socialist countries; it destroys the dark plans of Fascist traitors and thus helps to consolidate the cause of peace. This is the most severe and greatest blow recently dealt to the instigators of war. This is a very important achievement in the struggle to maintain international peace. (Fascism—that is war)

    If the people (referring to the people of capitalist countries) rise up resolutely and promptly against the war conspiracies of their own governments, then they will be able to force them to abandon their attempts to wage war and abandon their actions to protect the troublemakers. The problem lies in being able to organize the people in a timely manner to fight for the maintenance of peace and to develop the struggle against the fascist instigators of war at all times and in all places. (United Front for the Struggle for Peace)

    There are some so-called "left-wing" windbags who vigorously propagate the view of fatalism, saying that war is unavoidable and that peace cannot be maintained. They say that since the fundamental cause of war is capitalism, war is unavoidable as long as capitalism exists, and the struggle to maintain peace is completely futile. If these people are not swindlers, then they are at least dogmatists who recite books by rote. They only see the unrestrained war forces everywhere and do not see the powerful peace factors at all.

　　无产阶级国际主义的杰出革命领袖
    季米特洛夫逝世一周年
    苏联各报均刊载专文纪念
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各报均于二日刊载专文，纪念无产阶级国际主义的杰出革命领袖季米特洛夫逝世一周年。
    消息报写道：季米特洛夫的英雄的一生，忠诚地致力于革命活动的一生，感召着在为反对新战争煽动者、争取和平、自由及民族独立而斗争的全世界数以百万计的男女。
    真理报转载了《争取持久和平、争取人民民主》周刊发表的保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记契尔文科夫所撰《遵循季米特洛夫的道路》的专文。
    季米特洛夫语录
    法西斯主义——这就是战争！（法西斯主义——这就是战争）
    仅仅希望和平，是不够的。还应当为和平而斗争。（为和平而奋斗的统一战线）
    为和平而斗争，就是反法西斯主义的斗争，反资本主义的斗争，也就是为争取全世界社会主义胜利的斗争。（为和平而奋斗的统一战线）
    只有团结一致的无产阶级，方能成为这一和平战线的组织者，成为这一战线的领导力量与骨干。所以，全世界无产阶级的中心任务，也就在这里。（为和平而奋斗的统一战线）
    如果不首先采取一切必要的办法，去建立每个国家中工人阶级的统一战线，以及国际工人组织的行动统一，那就不能认真地出来保持国际和平。（法西斯主义——这就是战争）
    在社会主义国家中揭露并消灭法西斯奸细、暗杀者、军事破坏者和侦探，这就巩固了社会主义国家经济上、政治上和军事上的力量，这就破坏了法西斯奸贼的黑暗计划，这样就帮助了和平事业的巩固。这是近来对战争挑拨者最厉害的最大的打击。这是保持国际和平的斗争中非常重要的成绩。（法西斯主义——这就是战争）
    如果人民（按指资本主义国家的人民）起来坚决而及时地反对本国政府作战的阴谋，那末，他们就能够使它不得不放弃进行战争的企图，放弃袒护挑战祸首的行动。问题是在于要能及时组织人民进行保持和平的斗争，要能随时随地发展反对法西斯战争祸首的斗争。（为和平而奋斗的统一战线）
    有一些所谓“左派”空谈家，极力宣传听天由命的观点，说战争是无法避免的，说和平是无法维持的。他们说，战争的基本原因既然是资本主义，那末，当资本主义还存在的时候，战争是无法避免的，保持和平的斗争，完全是徒劳无功的事情。这些人如果不是骗子，那末至少是背死书的教条主义者。他们到处只看到横行无忌的战争势力，而丝毫看不见强有力的和平因素。（为和平而奋斗的统一战线）（新华社四日讯）（附图片）
