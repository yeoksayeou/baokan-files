　　Li Seung-man Bandits Massacred Opposition Assemblymen of the Puppet National Assembly Before Fleeing Seoul
    [New China News Agency, New York, 10th dispatch] TASS, New York, 9th dispatch: The American Compass newspaper carried Steele's report stating that senior American officials had repeatedly inquired of South Korean Ambassador Chang Myon about the current situation of South Korea's so-called "National Assembly," but have not received any reasonable answer on this issue. Steele pointed out that there is good reason to assume that any answer Chang Myon gives to this question may make Syngman Rhee and the American government feel very embarrassed. Steele recounted the following fact: The results of the May 30 "National Assembly" "election" were unfavorable to Syngman Rhee, with one hundred and sixty-two of his opponents winning seats in the South Korean "National Assembly." Steele pointed out that so far, United Nations personnel are still unclear about this secret and the whereabouts of the assemblymen. It is known that sixty of these assemblymen were in prison before Syngman Rhee fled Seoul. According to Syngman Rhee's confession, more than one hundred "pro-communist" political leaders were executed on the same day. Steele speculated that the executed political leaders were the recently elected members of the "National Assembly." Steele finally pointed out that since the beginning of the war, nothing has been heard about the assemblymen. In addition, the "National Assembly" is one of the South Korean government agencies, but has not yet in any way declared its support for Syngman Rhee.

　　李承晚匪徒逃离汉城之前
    大屠杀伪国会反对派议员
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约九日讯：美国指南针日报载史蒂尔的报道称：美国高级官员曾屡次询问南朝鲜大使张勉关于南朝鲜的所谓“国民议会”的现况，但是迄未得到有关此问题的任何合理的答复。史蒂尔指出：很有理由假定，张勉对这个问题的任何答复都可能使李承晚和美国政府感到非常狼狈。史蒂尔追述下一事实：五月三十日“国民议会”“选举”的结果对李承晚是不利的，他的反对者一六二人在南朝鲜的“国民议会”中获得了席次。史蒂尔指出，至今为止，联合国职员对这个秘密及议员的下落如何，仍不清楚。据悉，在李承晚逃离汉城前，这些议员中有六十人是在监狱中。据李承晚的招供，同日有一百余“亲共”的政治领袖被处决了。史蒂尔推测说，被处决的政治领袖就是最近选出的“国民议会”的议员。史蒂尔最后指出，自战争开始后，从没有听说过有关议会议员的消息。此外，“国民议会”是南朝鲜政府机构之一，但迄今未以任何方式申明其对李承晚的支持。
