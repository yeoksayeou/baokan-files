Ambassador Jalkhasaikhan's Eulogy:
Respected Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

I am honored to present to you the credentials from the Presidium of the Little Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic appointing me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China.

Mr. Chairman, at the time of presenting my credentials to you, allow me, on behalf of the Mongolian people, to express our sincere friendship to the great Chinese people, who stand at the forefront of the struggle in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the great Soviet Union.

I am fortunate to represent my government in the friendly People's Republic of China, which is a sincere friend of our people and all peace-loving peoples of the world.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to assure you that I understand all the responsibilities entrusted to me to further develop and consolidate the sincere friendship and full mutual understanding between our two countries.

Mr. Chairman, I wish to assure you that I will do my utmost to contribute to the successful completion of this task that I must fulfill.

I hope that in completing this glorious task, I will receive the full understanding and support from you, Mr. Chairman, and from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply:
Mr. Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept the credentials from the Presidium of the Little Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic presented by Your Excellency, and I thank Your Excellency for your warm congratulations.

Close relations originally existed between the peoples of China and Mongolia. For decades, due to the instigation of imperialism and the reactionary rule of China, communication between us was severed. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the Mongolian people not only broke away from the reactionary rule of China long ago and established a truly people's democratic state, but are also advancing along the road of economic and cultural construction. The Chinese people sincerely congratulate the Mongolian people on this achievement. Now, the Chinese people's revolution has been basically victorious, and diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia have been established. I believe that this will not only further develop and consolidate the friendship between our two peoples, but will also contribute to lasting peace in Asia and the world.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency to serve as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Mongolia to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to assist Your Excellency in strengthening cooperation between our two countries.

I sincerely wish your country prosperity and your people prosperity, and I wish your head of state good health.

    主席先生，向您呈递国书的时候，让我代表蒙古人民向伟大的中国人民表示真诚的友情，伟大的中国人民站在以伟大的苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营战斗的最前列。
    我幸运地代表我国政府出使友邦中华人民共和国，她是我国人民及全世界爱好和平的各国人民的真诚朋友。

    毛泽东主席答词大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受贵大使呈递的蒙古人民共和国小呼拉尔主席团的国书，并感谢贵大使的热忱祝贺。
    中蒙两国人民之间原已存在有密切的关系，数十年来，由于帝国主义和中国反动统治的挑拨离间，隔断了彼此间的来往。蒙古人民在十月革命的影响下，不但早已脱离了中国的反动统治，建立了真正的人民民主国家，而且正朝着经济、文化建设的发展道路前进，中国人民衷心地为蒙古人民的这一成就庆贺。现在，中国人民革命已基本胜利了，中蒙两国的外交关系业已建立，我相信，这不但将使贵我两国人民间的友谊更加发展与巩固，而且将有助于亚洲及世界的持久和平。

    谨祝贵国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝贵国元首健康。
