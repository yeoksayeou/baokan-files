　　Militia and Laborers Sacrificing in War Should Be Considered Martyrs
    Answering Questions from Comrades Li Nongyong and Liu Shuchun

To the Editor:
    We have two questions we don't understand, please provide answers.
    First, should militia and laborers who sacrificed at the front while supporting the front lines be considered martyrs? Should they themselves be allocated land during the land reform?
    Second, should staff members of the People's Government, organizations, and groups who die from overwork be considered martyrs? Are they allocated land?

                                         Li Nongyong, Liu Shuchun

To Comrades Li Nongyong and Liu Shuchun:
    First, militia and laborers who sacrifice because of participation in the war should be called martyrs. After the government issues the "Glorious Certificate of Revolutionary Sacrifice for Militia and Laborer Family Members," their families should enjoy preferential treatment in accordance with the martyr's family treatment. According to the provisions of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, in the land reform, the martyr himself should be counted in the family population and allocated a portion of land as a form of pension for the martyr's family.
    Second, the issue of compensation for the death of revolutionary workers should be treated separately according to the following circumstances: A. Revolutionary workers who die of illness while on duty or die accidentally while working are not considered martyrs. B. Revolutionary workers who gloriously sacrifice due to struggle against the enemy or while on duty should be called martyrs. C. Revolutionary workers who die of illness but have a long revolutionary history and have made special contributions to the revolution may be posthumously recognized as martyrs after the application from the organization they belong to has been approved by the people's government above the provincial (municipal) level. Anyone who obtains the title of martyr should be allocated a portion of land in the land reform, and the martyr's family should also enjoy martyr's family treatment.

　　民兵民工参战牺牲应算烈士
    答李农勇、刘树春同志问编辑同志：
    我们有两个问题不明白，请你给予解答。
    一、支援前线时的民兵、民工在前线牺牲了，是不是应算烈士？在土改中他本人应不应该分得土地？
    二、在人民政府、机关团体的工作人员因公积劳而病死者，算不算烈士？是否分给土地？
                                         李农勇、刘树春李农勇、刘树春同志：
    一、民兵、民工因为参战而牺牲者，应称为烈士，由政府发给“革命牺牲民兵民工家属光荣纪念证”后，其家属应按烈属待遇享受优待。根据中华人民共和国土地改革法的规定，在土地改革中烈士本人应当计算在家庭人口内分得一份土地，作为对于烈士家属的一种抚恤。
    二、对于革命工作人员死亡抚恤问题，应按下列情况分别待遇：甲、革命工作人员因公病故或在工作中不慎而致死者，不算烈士。乙、革命工作人员因对敌斗争或因公而光荣牺牲者，应称为烈士。丙、病故的革命工作人员革命历史较长且对革命有特殊功绩者，经过所在机关申请省（市）以上人民政府批准，可以追认为烈士。凡取得烈士称号者，在土地改革中烈士本人即应分得一份土地，烈士家属亦应享受烈属待遇。
