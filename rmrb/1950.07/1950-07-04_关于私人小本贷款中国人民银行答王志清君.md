　　On Private Small Loan - People's Bank of China's Reply to Wang Zhiqing

　　Mr. Wang Zhiqing:
    Your question has been answered by the People's Bank of China as follows:
    Private small loans are limited to those who lend to those who purchase materials from afar to facilitate urban-rural exchange and those who engage in small-scale handicraft production but lack partial working capital. You can apply for a loan from the nearby People's Bank of China with a business license and a certificate from the trade association. The value of the collateral will be determined based on the nature of the business, the amount of the loan, and after investigation. The term is one to three months. The interest rate is two to three and a half percent.
