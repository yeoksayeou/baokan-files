　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Enterprises
    Create Over Fifty Kinds of Propaganda and Mobilization Methods
    [Our Newspaper] Since the end of April, various enterprise units under the Tianjin Railway Bureau have universally launched propaganda and mobilization work in production. In the past two months, they have created over fifty kinds of propaganda and mobilization methods, which have greatly promoted the improvement of transportation and production efficiency and the creation of new records.
    Understanding Production Tasks and Familiarizing Themselves with Production Processes
    According to the experience of the three sub-bureaus and eleven factories, sections, and stations, propaganda and mobilization work must revolve around current production tasks. Personnel engaged in propaganda and mobilization work must understand production tasks, understand the technical processes of production, listen to the opinions of the workers, raise mobilization slogans targeting the problems in production and the ideological situation of the masses, and promptly disseminate the experience of advanced producers, help and criticize the backward, and conduct sharp struggles against those who are lazy and saboteurs. For example, when the Nankou Machine Factory decided to launch a production competition and innovation record movement in April, some workers believed that "no new records can be created"; some were afraid of layoffs after production efficiency was improved; and others were afraid that raising individual output would be ridiculed by others. The factory's propaganda and mobilization workers seized on these issues, used individual conversations, held discussion meetings, gave large lectures, and other methods to raise questions for the workers to brew and discuss. At the same time, they also introduced Zhao Guoyou's experience in creating new records in detail; and adapted Zhao Guoyou's deeds into a stage play. In addition, they held forums for veteran workers (calling on young workers to participate), and invited Xu Furong, a retired veteran worker with thirty years of experience in turning cylinders, to mobilize him to train apprentices. This broke the conservative thinking of some workers and attracted workers from the entire factory to gradually participate in the competition. The factory's vehicle section had not completed its production tasks in the first three months of this year, but this time, the workers were all mobilized. Youth League member Li Shuliang was the first to sign up to participate in the production competition and created the first new record; then the Yu He Bao Xiu group of the woodworking factory also created a new record and won the glorious model flag. The propagandist immediately posted their deeds and photos on the "Model Deeds Board," encouraging all the workers in the section to hold group meetings for discussion and launch a competition. In the factory's boiler section, propagandists used individual conversations, worker conferences, and other methods to break through the concerns of individual workers and adopted the Soviet "assembly line method," enabling seven people to complete the work of ten people in four days in three days. This strengthened everyone's confidence in promoting advanced working methods. After the production competition was launched in various departments, the factory proposed "Use your brains and think of good methods" to avoid simply increasing labor intensity. At the same time, propagandists went deep into various workshops and groups to discover problems, understand production and the ideological situation of the workers, and promptly disseminate experience in improving technology and transforming tools. In one month, the factory's workers put forward seventy-six rationalization proposals. The new tools created by workers Yu Diankuan, Liu Chunsheng, Wang Deguang, and others can improve work efficiency by thirteen to sixteen times. With the promotion and help of propaganda and mobilization work, the Nankou Machine Factory completed 135.1% of its production tasks in May.
    Propose Concise Slogans Targeting Production Characteristics
    Secondly, propaganda and mobilization work should propose different slogans according to the characteristics of production departments and the different tasks of each period; the more concise and specific the slogans, the more powerful they are. For example, the road maintenance workers of the Yongjiabao work zone of the Zhangjiakou Works Section created a new record of repairing six meters per day. Some workers in other zones still didn't believe it. The Works Section organized workers to visit Yongjiabao on the spot, and at the same time proposed the slogan "Reach six meters, learn from Yongjiabao." When most work zones reached six meters, Yongjiabao had already exceeded six meters. The section then proposed the slogan "Break through six meters, catch up with Yongjiabao," and the masses worked hard towards the new goal. For example, in order to shorten the stopping time of freight cars from fifteen hours to eleven and a half hours, Tianjin East Station proposed the slogan "Complete Eleven Point Five," which has now exceeded the predetermined goal. In addition, the vehicle affairs department proposed "500,000 kilometers without accidents," the machinery department proposed "Reach 200,000 safe kilometers," and the Nankou factory proposed "Not a drop of oil leaked, not a drop of water leaked." Some workers hung the slogans next to the machines and worked hard to achieve them at any time.
    Adopt Diverse Forms and Use Flexibly at Any Time
    Third, propaganda and mobilization work must take a variety of forms. In recent months, various units of the Tianjin Railway have created and adopted more than fifty methods. There are oral, written, pictorial, as well as broadcasting, telephone networks, evening parties, plays, exhibitions, etc.; there are also various individual mobilizations and collective propaganda. Among them, such as using "ten-minute mobilization" before going to work in the morning to disseminate a new record or a major event; using "demonstration mobilization" to publicize the experience of advanced producers; using "sending good news" and erecting "glory towers" to encourage individuals and units with new achievements in production. These have had good results. At the same time, reading newspapers and writing news reports are also good ways to promote and mobilize. In addition to organizing the reading of local and national newspapers, each unit has also self-published twenty-seven kinds of small production newspapers; in recent months, hundreds of news reports have been submitted, increasing the power of propaganda and mobilization.
    Party Committee Unified Leadership and Attention to Political Content
    Fourth, propaganda and mobilization work should be unified under the leadership of the CCP committee or branch in the enterprise, with the active participation of the administration, trade union, and Youth League, and the mobilization of the broad masses. At the same time, it should be carried out in a planned way to prevent bias. A high degree of political and ideological content should be infused into the propaganda. For example, one unit had a cartoon depicting workers forging iron, with each piece falling on the imperialists, and adding the slogan, explaining that our increase in production is a blow to imperialism. Linking production and the anti-imperialist struggle in this way has a positive effect on improving workers' enthusiasm for production and political awareness. On the other hand, some units simply used "bonuses," "promotions," and "wearing glory hats" as propaganda content, neglecting to raise the awareness of the working class and failing to link the workers' production with the entire construction cause of our new country. These should be improved.

    创五十余种宣传鼓动方法
    【本报讯】天津铁路局各企业单位，自四月底起普遍开展了生产中的宣传鼓动工作。两个多月中，创造了五十多种宣传鼓动方法，对提高运输与生产效率和创造新纪录起了很大的推动作用。
    了解生产任务熟习生产过程
    根据三个分局和十一个厂、段、站的经验，宣传鼓动工作必须围绕当前的生产任务进行。从事宣传鼓动工作的人员要了解生产任务，了解生产的技术过程，倾听工人群众的意见，针对生产中的问题与群众的思想情况提出鼓动口号，并及时传播先进生产者的经验，帮助和批评落后者，对怠工者和破坏分子进行尖锐的斗争。如南口机厂在四月份决定开展生产竞赛与创新纪录运动时，曾有部分工人认为“创不出什么新纪录来”；有的人则怕提高了生产效率之后要裁人；也有人怕提高个人的产量会受别人的讽刺。该厂的宣传鼓动工作者就抓住这些问题，以个别谈话、开座谈会、上大课等方式，提出问题让工人群众去酝酿讨论。同时，并详细介绍赵国有创新纪录的经验；又将赵国有的事迹编成话剧出演。此外，并召开老工人座谈会（叫青年工人也参加），又请回已退休了的具有三十年旋汽缸经验的老工人徐富荣，发动他带徒弟。以此打破某些工人的保守思想，吸引全厂工人陆续参加了竞赛。该厂的车辆所，今年头三个月都没有完成生产任务，这一回，工人们都被鼓动起来了。青年团员李书良首先报名参加生产竞赛，并创造了第一个新纪录；接着木工厂于河包修组也创造了新纪录，得到了光荣模范旗。宣传员马上把他们的事迹和像片贴到“模范事迹牌”上，鼓励了全所工人，纷纷开小组会讨论，展开了竞赛。在该厂的锅炉所，宣传员以个别谈话、开工人大会等方式，打破个别工人的顾虑，采用了苏联的“流水作业法”，使十个人四天的工作由七个人在三天中完成。这样，坚定了大家推广先进工作方法的信心。在各部门的生产竞赛开展之后，该厂又提出“开动脑筋，想好方法”，避免单纯地增加劳动强度。同时，宣传员深入各车间、小组去发现问题，了解生产和工人思想情况，及时传播改进技术和改造工具的经验。一个月中，该厂工人提出了七十六件合理化建议。工人于殿宽、刘春生、王德广等所创造的新工具，能提高工作效率十三倍至十六倍。在宣传鼓动工作的推动帮助之下，南口机厂五月份完成了生产任务的百分之一百三十五点一。
    针对生产特点提出简明口号
    其次，宣传鼓动工作要根据生产部门特点与各个时期的不同任务，提出不同的口号；口号越简明具体，越有力量。如张家口工务段永嘉堡工区养路工人创造了每天修六公尺的新纪录。别区工人有的还不相信。工务段一面组织工人到永嘉堡去实地参观，同时提出“达到六公尺，向永嘉堡看齐”的口号。当多数工区达到六公尺时，永嘉堡又已超过六公尺了。该段又提出“突破六公尺，赶上永嘉堡”的口号，群众又向新的目标努力了。又如天津东站为要把货车停站时间从十五小时缩短到十一小时半，提出了“完成十一点五”的口号，现在已超过了预定的目标。此外，如车务部门提出“五十万公里无事故”，机务部门提出“达到二十万安全公里”，南口工厂提出“不漏一滴油，不漏一滴水”。有的工人把口号挂在机器旁边，随时为实现它而努力。
    采取多样形式  随时灵活运用
    第三，宣传鼓动工作要采取多种多样的形式。天津铁路各单位近几个月来创造和采用了五十多种方式。有口头的、文字的、图画的以及广播、电话网、晚会、演剧、展览会等；也有各种个别的鼓动和集体的宣传。其中如利用早上上班前进行“十分钟鼓动”来传播某一项新纪录或某一个重大事件；以“示范鼓动”来宣传先进生产者的经验；以“送喜报”，立“光荣塔”来鼓励生产上有新成就的个人和单位。这些都有很好的效果。同时，读报与写通讯也是好的宣传鼓动方式。各单位除组织读各地日报外，还自办了二十七种生产小报；数月来投出了数百篇通讯稿，增加了宣传鼓动的力量。
    党委统一领导注意政治内容
    第四，宣传鼓动工作要由企业中的中共党委或支部统一领导，行政、工会、青年团积极参加，并发动广大群众来作。同时要有计划地进行，防止偏向。宣传中应灌注高度的政治思想内容。如某单位有一张漫画，画着工人打铁，一块一块都落在帝国主义者身上，并加上标语，说明我们生产的增加就是给帝国主义的打击。这样把生产和反帝斗争联系起来，对工人生产积极性与政治觉悟的提高都有作用。反之，某些单位单纯地拿“奖金”、“升级”、“戴光荣帽子”等来作宣传内容，忽视提高工人阶级觉悟，没有把工人的生产和我们新国家的整个建设事业联系起来，这些是应该改进的。
