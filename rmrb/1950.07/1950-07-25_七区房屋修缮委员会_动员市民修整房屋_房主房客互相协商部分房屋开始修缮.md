　　Seventh District Housing Repair Committee
    Mobilizes Citizens to Repair Houses

    Landlords and Tenants Negotiate, Partial House Repairs Begin
    [Our Newspaper] The Seventh District Housing Repair Committee is conducting widespread publicity throughout the district, mobilizing landlords and tenants to repair houses. In the Eleventh Police Station jurisdiction, over forty houses with disputes between landlords and tenants, or where both sides were deadlocked due to low rent, have begun repairs after mediation. In the vicinity of the Sun Palace in the Fifteenth Police Station jurisdiction, after landlord-tenant disputes were resolved through negotiation, one side provided materials and the other provided labor for joint repairs. In the case of the Li family house in Xisi Kuaiyu, due to the low rent, it was negotiated that the tenant would repair it, with the expenses to be deducted from the rent in the future. Some landlords and tenants are willing to repair houses first, leaving the truly unsolvable disputes for later negotiation. Some landlords went back and repaired their houses after the symposium.
    Recently, due to continuous heavy rain, some houses awaiting repair have collapsed. Residents affected by the disaster have either moved to relatives' homes, or the district government has temporarily moved those with nowhere to go to live in temples. Houses that have already been repaired have avoided collapse and loss in the heavy rain.

　　七区房屋修缮委员会
    动员市民修整房屋           
    房主房客互相协商部分房屋开始修缮
    【本报讯】七区房屋修缮委员会正在全区广泛宣传，动员房东、房客修缮房屋。十一派出所界内房东与房客间有纠纷的、或因房租低双方僵持的，经调解后已有四十余间开始修理。十五派出所太阳宫附近房东房客纠纷经协商解决后，由一方出料一方出工共同修理。西四块玉李姓房子因房租低，经协商后由房客修，费用将来从租金中扣除。有的房东房客愿先修房子，把实在解决不了的纠纷留待以后协商。有些房东在座谈会后，回去就修房了。
    近来，连日大雨，部分待修的房屋发生倒塌，受灾居民除迁往亲戚家者外，区政府对无处安身者，暂时着其移往庙中居住。已经整修了的房屋，在大雨中就避免了倒塌损失。
