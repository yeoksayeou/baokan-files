　　How to Improve Newspaper Study?
    -- Introducing the Newspaper Reading Methods and Experiences of National Advanced Industrial School
    Zhu Guisen
    After the start of school this spring, the administration stipulated a newspaper reading time of 1:00 PM every day. The Student Life Guidance Section marked the day's key points in the newspaper, and students could read according to the specified key points. This approach could save time. However, since students had not developed the habit of reading newspapers, many groups became mere formalities and developed biases: for example, students were not focused when reading newspapers; although the readers put in a lot of effort, some people still didn't listen. Furthermore, reading skills were poor, and they couldn't read sentences smoothly, failing to attract the attention of the audience. There were also some people who neither read the newspaper nor participated in newspaper reading. In late March, the administration conducted a test, and the results showed that half of the students failed. At this time, the administration pointed out the bias of neglecting the newspaper reading groups, making the students deeply aware of the importance of improving the newspaper reading groups. They explained that the purpose was to first enable students to understand current events, to improve their political awareness, and to develop their ability to analyze problems. Improvements were also made in learning methods: (1) In order to overcome the difficulty of having few newspapers and many people, the newspapers were collected and divided into two classes for reading. (2) To check the learning situation, a monthly exam system was established. Through exams, criticism was directed at classes that did poorly in their studies, so that they could ensure participation in newspaper reading in the future and improve their reading methods.
    Before reading the newspaper, the students in the Department of Metallurgy would have the reader give a summary of the day's news, so that all group members could understand the important news of the day, making it easier to accept when reading. After reading, the reader would write down the nouns and place names that were not easy to remember at the time. In this way, the newspaper study in April began to change, and the monthly exam results were slightly better than before. For example, out of the fourteen classes in the school, five passed, and some classes had an average score of over 84 points. After the administration announced the results of this test, the students went back to conduct self-criticism in their groups. Some classes thought that since most of the test questions were about people's names, place names, and the names of New Democratic countries, they could get good scores in the future by memorizing people's names and place names and looking at maps more often. In order to correct this bias, the administration promptly convened a meeting of group leaders, telling the students that the next monthly exam would not test people's names and place names, but would pay attention to international issues and the relationship between public and private industrial and commercial enterprises in China. At this time, the study department's blackboard newspaper also opened a current affairs column, publishing weekly current affairs review outlines to attract students' attention. The mechanical engineering classes also established current affairs groups, answering questions and summarizing bi-weekly current affairs. Since then, students have become interested in reading newspapers. You see, on each issue of the blackboard newspaper, there are projects for challenging, responding to, and answering questions. The mood for reading newspapers has greatly improved compared to before, and everyone is rushing to read the newspaper as soon as it arrives. Therefore, in the May test, a total of about 90 percent of the students in the school passed. Even some classes had an average test score of 82.9.
    After summarizing the work of the newspaper reading group, we gained the following points of experience: (1) The administration must strengthen its leadership over the newspaper reading group, so that students can clearly recognize the importance of current affairs study in their thinking. (2) The reader should not only have a clear voice, but also make appropriate preparations in advance. When reading the newspaper, everyone should listen and watch carefully, and record anything they don't understand immediately, and then find reference materials afterwards. (3) The reader should grasp the key points, and important news can be read repeatedly, while the secondary news can be reported in general terms. (4) The group should make a summary every week, so that each student can gain a more systematic understanding of certain issues. (5) Do not let the newspaper sit idle (except during class), always remind everyone to pay attention to the newspaper, engage in casual conversations everywhere, practice analyzing problems, and regularly check learning performance.
    Three months of newspaper reading has not only enabled students to have a more correct understanding of current events, but also greatly helped the study of political classes. The phenomenon of neglecting newspaper study is currently only a problem in individual classes.

　　怎样改善报纸学习？
    ——介绍国立高工的读报方法与经验
    朱桂森
    今春开学后，我校行政上规定每天一点钟的读报时间，由生活指导科画出本日报纸的重点，同学们可按指定的重点去阅读。这样作可以节省时间。但由于同学们对读报纸没有养成习惯，不少的小组流于形式，并发生了偏向：如同学们在读报时精神不集中，读的人虽费了很大的劲，有些人仍然听不进去。再是读报的技术差，念不通顺字句，不能引起听众的注意。还有些人既不看报纸也不参加读报。三月下旬，行政上进行了一次测验，结果有半数同学不及格。这时，行政上便向同学们指出了不重视读报组的偏向，使同学们深刻认识到健全读报组的重要，并说明其目的在于首先要同学明白时事，是为了提高同学的政治觉悟、锻炼自己分析问题的能力。在学习方法上也作了改进：（一）为了克服报纸少人多的困难，把报纸集中起来，分成两班阅读。（二）检查学习情况，规定月考制度。通过考试，对学习不好的班次展开批评，使其今后能保证参加读报，并能改进读报方法。
    冶金系同学在读报前，读报人先将本日新闻摘要报告一下，使全组人员了解当天的重要新闻，读时才易于接受。读后，由读报的人把当时不易记住的名词、地名记下来。这样，四月份的报纸学习开始有了转变，月考成绩较前稍好。例如全校十四个班，及格者有五班，还有的班次平均分数达八十四分强。行政上将此次测验结果公布后，同学们看了后都回去在组里进行检讨。有的班因为此次考的大半是人名、地名以及新民主主义国家的名称等，大家就以为今后多记人名、地名，多看地图就能考好。于是同学们每天死啃地名、人名。行政上为了纠正这个偏向，便及时召集小组长会议，告诉同学下次月考，不考人名地名，而要注意国际问题，及国内工商业公私关系等等。此时学习部的黑板报也开辟了时事栏，刊出每周时事复习提纲，以引起同学们注意。机械系乙丙班也相继成立了时事小组、解答问题与总结半月时事。自此以后，同学们对读报才发生了兴趣。你看，每期的黑板报上，都有挑战应战解答问题的项目。读报情绪较前大为提高，每天报纸一来，大伙抢着去看。因此，五月份测验成绩，总计全校人数及格者约占百分之九十。甚至有的班次的测验成绩平均分数达八十二点九。
    我们总结了读报组工作以后，获得下列几点经验（一）行政上必须加强对读报组的领导，使同学在思想上明确认识时事学习的重要性。（二）读报的人不但声音要清晰，事先应作适当准备。读报时大家要耳听眼看，不了解的当即记下来，事后再找参考材料。（三）读的人应掌握重点，对重要的新闻可以重复读几遍，次要的可报告大意。（四）小组里每周要做总结，这样可使每一个同学对某些问题获得较有系统的了解。（五）不让报纸闲着（除上课外），随时提醒大家注意报纸，随地进行漫谈，练习分析问题并定期检查学习成绩。
    三个月的读报工作，不但使同学们对目前时事有了比较正确的认识，同时也大大帮助了政治课的学习。目前忽视报纸学习的现象，仅是个别班次的问题了。
