Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has submitted to and been approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to reduce passenger fares and rates for luggage, parcels, and miscellaneous fees on the Northern and Southern Railways starting July 15th. First and second class carriages will be renamed soft-seat carriages, and third class carriages will be renamed hard-seat carriages. The soft-seat ticket price will be twice that of the hard-seat ticket. Passenger mileage, originally calculated separately for the North and South, will now be calculated together, but the progressively decreasing rate will be appropriately reduced. After the change, the ordinary hard-seat ticket price from Beijing to Tianjin will be reduced from 16,100 yuan to 14,700 yuan; Beijing to Shanghai will be reduced from 138,500 yuan to 112,400 yuan; Beijing to Hankou will be reduced from 100,450 yuan to 97,700 yuan; Beijing to Guangzhou will be reduced from 200,240 yuan to 148,200 yuan. The luggage fee for items up to 50 kilograms will be reduced from 1.9 yuan per kilogram per kilometer to 1 yuan. In addition, parcel and miscellaneous fees have also been appropriately reduced.

　　自七月十五日起
    北方、南方铁路减低客运运价等
    【新华社六日讯】中央人民政府铁道部已呈准政务院财政经济委员会，从七月十五日起，减低北方、南方铁路客运运价及行李、包裹、杂费等价率，并将头、二等车改名软席车，三等车改名硬席车。软席车票价为硬席车的二倍。客运里程，原来为北方、南方分别计算，现在改为合并计算，但递远递减率则酌予缩小。改变后，北京到天津的硬席车普通票价自一万六千一百元减低为一万四千七百元；北京到上海自十三万八千五百元减低为十一万二千四百元；北京到汉口自十万零四千五百元减低为九万七千七百元；北京到广州自二十万零二千四百元减低为十四万八千二百元。五十公斤以内的行李费原为每公斤每公里一点九元，现减低为一元。此外，包裹和杂费率也已适当地减低。
