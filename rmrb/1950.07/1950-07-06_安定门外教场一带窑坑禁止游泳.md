Kyoto News Agency report: Swimming Prohibited in the Quarry Pits Near Jiaochang Outside Andingmen

[News from the Kyoto News Agency] There are more than ten quarry pits in the Jiaochang area outside Andingmen in this city. Because of the deep accumulated water, some citizens swim there every summer. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, more than ten people drowned there every year. Last summer, a few citizens went there, and the North Suburbs Public Security Bureau persuaded them to stop, and fortunately, no accidents occurred. Recently, more than one hundred workers and students have been venturing to swim there every day. In order to ensure the safety of people's lives, the Kyoto Public Security Bureau, in addition to suggesting that the Municipal Hygiene and Engineering Bureau fill up the quarry pits, has also notified citizens to prohibit swimming there, and has ordered the North Suburbs Public Security Bureau to strictly enforce this order.

　　安定门外教场一带窑坑禁止游泳
    【京市新闻处讯】本市安定门外教场一带，有窑坑十余处，因积水颇深，每当夏季即有些市民在那里游泳，在国民党反动统治时期，每年总有十余人淹死。去年夏天亦有少数市民前去，经北郊公安分局说服制止，幸未发生事故。近来每日复有百余工人、学生，前往冒险游泳。京市公安局为保障人民生命的安全，除建议卫生工程局将该处窑坑填塞外，并通告市民禁止前往游泳，已令北郊公安分局严格执行。（公宣）
