Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang:

　　Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong broadcast the following statement via radio at 11 PM on July 1st: U.S. President Truman stated on June 27th that he had ordered the U.S. Air Force and Navy to participate in the war within Korea to aid the South Korean puppet regime which launched the Korean internecine war under the direction of U.S. imperialism. Truman declared on June 30th the dispatch of U.S. ground forces to South Korea. American planes are subjecting our peaceful residents in Pyongyang and other parts of North Korea, as well as liberated towns and cities in South Korea, to piratical bombing raids, and attacking People's Army troops, thereby hindering our victorious advance to the South. Thus, the policy of the U.S. imperialists to enslave the Korean people and turn Korea into a colony has taken the form of open armed intervention against the Korean Democratic People's Republic.

　　The U.S. imperialists have long dreamed of establishing their hegemony in the Far East. However, they previously had to consider the imperialist interests of Britain, Japan, and other powers, and expand their positions in the Far East at the expense of the enslaved people of Asia through collusion with these powers. Therefore, the Korean people will never forget that in 1905, the United States conspired with Japan to strengthen its rule in the Philippines, and facilitated Japan's establishment of a "protectorate" over Korea. After the Second World War, which defeated Japan and weakened Britain, U.S. imperialism decided to take their place among the Far Eastern countries, striving to turn the Pacific Ocean into an inland sea of the United States and make the people of Pacific countries slaves of American monopoly capitalists. However, the consolidation of the democratic camp, the development of national liberation movements in Asian countries, and especially the great victory of the Chinese people shattered the conspiracies and intrigues of the U.S. imperialists.

　　Directing the Lee Clique to Implement Terrorist Rule in South Korea - The Hands of U.S. Imperialism are Stained with the Blood of the Korean People

　　The Korean people have already tasted the full burden of the colonial policies of the U.S. imperialists. They have just shaken off the chains of the hated Japanese, and are now threatened with enslavement. The U.S. imperialists have strived to retain South Korea, stubbornly obstructing the Korean people's movement for unification. They have obstructed the establishment of a single Korean democratic government based on the decision of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers of the USSR, the United States, and Britain. They refused to withdraw their troops stationed in Korea until, with the help of the Lee Seung-man puppet government they fostered, they turned South Korea into their colony. Now the Korean people know that even after the U.S. troop withdrawal, South Korea remains under the rule of the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists established a gendarmerie rule in South Korea, resulting in all kinds of crimes. The Lee Seung-man clique, on the orders of its American masters, shot and killed tens of thousands of Korean people's sons and daughters, and hundreds of thousands of patriots were thrown into prison and subjected to torture; the U.S. imperialists, together with the Lee Seung-man clique, should bear full responsibility for the infinite suffering of the South Korean people. The hands of the U.S. imperialists are stained with the blood of the Korean people.

　　But they failed to enslave the Korean people. This was primarily thwarted by the democratic system established in North Korea. North Korea has become a powerful base for the Korean people's struggle for unification, independence, and freedom. Its achievements in peaceful construction prove that the democratic system is far superior to the anti-national gendarmerie rule in South Korea; these achievements have also encouraged the Korean people to fight against the U.S. imperialists' attempts to colonize Korea, and have given the people confidence in final victory. This is why the U.S. imperialists and their South Korean lackeys, who have long hated the Korean Democratic People's Republic, have fabricated various conspiracies to strangle it with war. They have obstructed the realization of the proposals repeatedly put forward by the various democratic parties, public organizations, and the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic for the peaceful unification of Korea.

　　The Lee Seung-man "government," with the support of the United States, has openly attacked the North for two years, and has shamelessly said that its troops could occupy Pyongyang and Wonsan within a day, and that it was only waiting for the order to begin operations.

　　U.S. Imperialism Provokes Korean Civil War and Uses Armed Intervention - Attempts to Occupy the Entirety of Korea and Invade China and Vietnam

　　The Lee Seung-man government, having received guarantees of U.S. military support, launched the Korean internecine war on June 25th on the orders of its American masters. The U.S. imperialists attempted to use this war to destroy the Korean Democratic People's Republic by armed intervention and occupy the whole of Korea. The U.S. imperialists needed the Korean civil war also to create an excuse for invading China and Vietnam, in order to suppress the national liberation movements of the people of Eastern countries.

　　The United States is attempting to disguise its intervention in Korea in the name of the United Nations. As everyone knows, the U.S. imperialists have presented the United Nations with the fait accompli of armed intervention, believing that they can use the votes of some countries dependent on the United States to disguise any illegal act in the name of the United Nations, even after they have already committed such illegal acts. The resolution passed by the Security Council at the instigation of the United States is based on one-sided fabricated information, and this resolution is invalid and violates the UN Charter, because the representatives of the Korean Democratic People's Republic did not participate in the passage of this resolution, nor did the representatives of the two major permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union and China. The members of the Security Council who voted in favor of this resolution have once again shown that they can disregard the rights and interests of the people and gladly sign any document that the United States directs them to obey. Speaking of which, I cannot but mention that the pro-American majority in the United Nations is now frantically engaged in activities to save the bankrupt Lee Seung-man government. They ignore the repeated appeals to the United Nations by the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic and Korean mass organizations regarding the atrocities and military provocations of the Lee Seung-man government. And they turn a deaf ear to the concrete proposals for the peaceful unification of Korea put forward by Korean mass organizations and their appeals to the United Nations. This behavior has encouraged the adventurous measures of the United States and its South Korean dogs in provoking the Korean internecine war.

　　The Korean People Will Unite Even More Closely - Strengthen the Struggle for Unification and Independence to Answer U.S. Imperialist Aggression

　　The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean dogs who launched the Korean internecine war are greatly mistaken.

　　The Lee Seung-man army encountered a well-deserved counterattack, and under the blows of the People's Army, which has turned to the counter-offensive, is fleeing south. The heroic People's Army, which defends the freedom and independence of the Korean people, continues to pursue the enemy. In the past week's battles, the People's Army has cleared the enemy in a considerable part of the southern part of the Republic and liberated the capital of the motherland—Seoul. The people everywhere warmly welcome their army, which has liberated them from the terror of the Lee Seung-man regime, and actively support the People's Army in liberating the whole of Korea. The heroic guerrillas in South Korea have launched military activities on the enemy's lines of communication. They cut off the railway trunk line starting from the port of Busan, and, in coordination with the uprising people, liberated several cities in South Korea. The collapse of the Lee Seung-man army and the activities of the people in its rear once again prove the corruption and the end of the anti-national regime of the American puppet in South Korea. The complete bankruptcy of the Lee Seung-man regime is now clearly visible. Seeing their plan to colonize Korea shattered, the U.S. imperialists have stepped up their armed intervention against the Korean people. They want to drown Korea's freedom in the blood of Korean patriots. But they will certainly not scare the peace-loving Korean people.

　　In response to the United States' unreasonable aggression, the Korean people will unite even more closely under the banner of the Korean Democratic People's Republic and strengthen their sacred struggle for the freedom, unification, and independence of the motherland. The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic and the entire Korean people resolutely protest the barbarous bombing of Korean cities and villages, and protest the inhuman massacre of peaceful residents. We firmly believe that the upright people of the whole world will indignantly condemn the U.S. imperialists' aggression against the peace-loving Korean people. We believe that our just cause will find warm sympathy in the hearts of all people in the world.

　　斥杜鲁门命令美军武装侵略朝鲜
    朝鲜外长朴宪永声明的全文
    【新华社平壤讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部长朴宪永于七月一日下午十一时经由电台广播如下声明：美国总统杜鲁门于六月二十七日声称，已命令美国空军及海军参加朝鲜境内的战事，援助在美国帝国主义指使下发动朝鲜同族相残的战争的南朝鲜傀儡政权。杜鲁门于六月三十日宣称派遣美国地面部队前往南朝鲜。美国的飞机正使平壤与北朝鲜其他各地以及南朝鲜获得了解放的各城镇的我们的和平居民，遭受海盗式的轰炸空袭，并袭击人民军的部队，借以阻挠我们胜利地向南进攻。这样，美帝国主义者所奉行的奴役朝鲜人民并使朝鲜沦为殖民地的政策，便已采取了对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国实行公开武装干涉的形式。
    美帝国主义者很久以来就梦想着建立他们在远东的霸权。然而，他们以前必须考虑到英、日及其他列强的帝国主义利益，通过与这些强国勾结而以亚洲被奴役人民为牺牲的手段来扩张他们在远东的阵地。因此，朝鲜人民永远也不会忘记：一九○五年，美国为了加强其在菲律宾的统治，竟与日本密谋，并便利了日本建立对朝鲜的“保护权”。在那使日本被击溃、使英国被削弱的二次世界大战以后，美国帝国主义就决定在远东国家中取它们的地位而代之，力图将太平洋变为美国的内海，使太平洋各国的人民沦为美国垄断资本家的奴隶。然而，民主阵营力量的巩固、亚洲各国民族解放运动的发展、特别是中国人民的伟大胜利粉碎了美国帝国主义者的阴谋诡计。
    指使李匪在南朝鲜实行恐怖统治  美帝手上沾满了朝鲜人民的鲜血
    朝鲜人民已经备尝美国帝国主义者殖民政策的全部负担之苦。他们刚摆脱了可恨的日本的锁链，又受到奴化的威胁。美国帝国主义者力图保有南朝鲜，他们顽固地阻碍朝鲜人民的统一运动。他们对于根据苏、美、英三外长莫斯科会议的决定来建立单一的朝鲜民主政府一事，多方阻挠。直到他们在其所扶植起来的李承晚傀儡政府的帮助下，将南朝鲜变成了他们的殖民地以前，他们一直都拒绝撤退其驻朝鲜的军队。现在朝鲜人民都知道，即使在美国撤兵之后，南朝鲜依然是受美国帝国主义者统治的。美国帝国主义者在南朝鲜建立宪兵统治造成了种种罪行。李承晚集团奉其美国主子之命枪杀了数以万计的朝鲜人民的子女，数十万爱国者被投入监狱遭受酷刑；南朝鲜人民遭受无限的苦难，对于这一切，美国帝国主义者连同李承晚集团应该负完全责任。美国帝国主义者的手上已沾满了朝鲜人民的鲜血。
    但是他们未能奴役朝鲜人民。这首先是被北朝鲜所建立的民主制度所阻挠了。北朝鲜已成为朝鲜人民争取统一、独立及自由的强大基地。它在和平建设中的成就证明了民主制度远胜于南朝鲜的反民族的宪兵统治；这种成就也鼓舞了朝鲜人民向美帝国主义者殖民地化朝鲜的企图作斗争，并给予人民以对最后胜利的信心。这就是为什么长时期憎恨朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的美国帝国主义者及其南朝鲜走狗们制造各种阴谋以战争来窒死它的原因。他们阻挠了各民主党派、公众团体以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所屡次提出的和平统一朝鲜这一建议的实现。
    李承晚“政府”靠着美国的支持，二年来公开地攻击北方，并大言不惭地说它的军队能在一天之内占领平壤与元山，而它不过是在等待开始行动的命令罢了。
    美帝挑起朝鲜内战并用武装干涉  企图占领整个朝鲜侵略中国越南
    李承晚政府得到美国军事支援的保证后，就奉其美国主子之命，于六月二十五日发动了同族相残的战争。美帝国主义者企图以挑起这个战争来用武装干涉的方法摧毁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并占领整个朝鲜。美国帝国主义者的需要朝鲜内战，也为了要为侵略中国及越南制造借口，以便镇压东方各国人民的民族解放运动。
    美国企图以联合国的名义来掩饰它对朝鲜的干涉。大家知道，美国帝国主义者以武装干涉的既成事实摆在联合国面前，他们以为利用一些依附美国的国家的投票就可以假联合国之名来掩饰任何非法行为，即使在他们已经犯了这种非法行为之后。美国指使安理会通过的决议是以片面的捏造的情报为根据的，这个决议是无效的，是违反联合国宪章的，因为通过这个决议时并没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，也没有安理会常任理事的两大国——苏联与中国——的代表参加。投票赞成这个决议的安理会会员再度表明他们可以不顾人民的权利与利益，欣然在美国指使他们服从的任何文件上签字。说到这里，我不能不谈一谈联合国中亲美的多数国家现在正狂热地展开挽救破产了的李承晚政府的活动，它们把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府及朝鲜群众组织就李承晚政府的暴行和军事挑衅而向联合国一再提出的呼吁置之不理。而朝鲜群众组织提出朝鲜和平统一的具体建议，向联合国发出呼吁，它们也不闻不问，它们这种行为鼓励了美国及其南朝鲜走狗挑拨朝鲜同族相残的战争的冒险措施。
    朝鲜人民将更加紧密地团结起来  加强统一独立斗争回答美帝侵略
    美帝国主义者及发动朝鲜同族相残的战争的南朝鲜走狗是大错特错了。
    李承晚军队遭到了应有的反击，并在转入反攻的人民军的打击之下向南溃逃。维护朝鲜人民的自由和独立的英勇的人民军继续追击敌人。在上星期的战斗里，人民军在共和国南部相当大一部分地区肃清了敌人，解放了祖国的首都——汉城。各地人民热烈欢迎把他们从李承晚政权的恐怖下解放出来的他们的军队，并积极支持人民军解放全朝鲜。南朝鲜英勇的游击队在敌人的交通线上展开了军事活动。他们切断以釜山港为起点的铁路干线，配合起义的人民解放了南朝鲜若干城市。李承晚军的溃逃和人民在它的后方的活动，再次证明了南朝鲜美国傀儡的反民族政权的腐败和它的末日。李承晚政权的完全破产目前是看得清清楚楚了。美帝国主义者看到他们把朝鲜殖民地化的计划被粉碎，就加紧对朝鲜人民进行武装干涉。他们想把朝鲜的自由淹没在朝鲜爱国志士的血泊里。但是，他们一定吓不倒爱好和平的朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民为了回答美国无理的侵略，将在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下更加紧密地团结起来，加强他们争取祖国的自由、统一和独立的神圣的斗争。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民坚决抗议野蛮轰炸朝鲜城市和乡村，抗议不人道屠杀和平居民。我们深信全世界正直的人民将义愤地斥责美帝国主义者对爱好和平的朝鲜人民的侵略。我们相信：我们正义的事业将在世界上所有人民的心中找到热烈的同情。
