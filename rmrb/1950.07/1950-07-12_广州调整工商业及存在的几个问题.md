　　Guangzhou Adjusts Industry and Commerce and Existing Problems
　　Special Correspondent Gu Weijin

　　Guangzhou's industry and commerce, which had been monopolized and ravaged for a long time by imperialism and bureaucratic capital, has not been transformed since liberation, and transportation and sales have not been smooth. Therefore, the sales of products and the supply of raw materials have not been resolved. After March of this year, prices stabilized, and false purchasing power disappeared, making production and sales even more difficult. Faced with this situation, state-owned enterprises, according to the central government's policy of adjusting industry and commerce, adopted forms such as commissioned processing, ordering, and purchasing, and initially solved the sales and raw material problems of some private enterprises. The No. 3 Logistics Bureau of the Central and Southern Military Region's clothing factory, rubber factory, shoe factory, and material factory entrusted a large amount of raw materials to private factories for processing. From the end of last year to May of this year, it paid out approximately 46 billion yuan in processing fees, allowing more than 100 factories to continue production. The South China Grain Company and the Municipal Grain Company entrusted a total of more than 50 million catties of rice to 31 private rice mills from January to May. Almost half of the production of these factories relied on the Grain Company's commissioned processing. In April and May, the Municipal Department Store exchanged nearly 100 pieces of yarn with more than 30 factories for knitted goods and chemical products, and entrusted cooperatives and weaving factories to process and manufacture towels, mosquito net cloth, etc., with more than 30 pieces of yarn. The company's consignment sales of finished products from private factories increased from 29 to 35. In May, the Provincial Department Store signed consignment sales and procurement contracts with 40 private factories. In June, it decided to use 70% of its total funds to support the production of private enterprises through acquisition, ordering, and other forms. From January to the first half of June, the Guangzhou Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Branch Company purchased approximately 10,000 bolts of cloth from private textile factories. In addition, by promoting private merchants to purchase large quantities of cloth, some motor weaving factories have resumed production. In March, the Municipal People's Bank, in view of the difficulty in selling textile products, took out more than 7 billion yuan to purchase 3,600 bolts of winter cloth and some summer cloth from the industry. When prices stabilized, and the money supply tightened, and private enterprises were feeling the difficulty of capital turnover, the Municipal People's Bank actively provided loans, totaling more than 4.4 billion yuan for industrial loans and 110 million yuan for trade loans. Recently, in order to further support the restoration and development of private industry and commerce, the bank decided to issue loans of 40 billion yuan.

　　After state-owned enterprises took the above-mentioned series of active measures, some legitimate industries and businesses in Guangzhou City began to show signs of recovery. According to statistics, from April to the first half of June, a total of 68 industrial enterprises applied to open, and 46 were approved; from April to the first half of June, a total of 432 commercial enterprises applied to open, and 266 were approved. Among them, import and export industries, textile industries, printing industries, and transportation industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood are the most numerous. In addition, there are more than 100 enterprises that previously applied for closure but are now continuing to operate or changing industries.

　　In the process of state-owned enterprises supporting private industry and commerce, many problems have occurred. These problems should and must be reasonably resolved.

　　First of all, when some state-owned enterprises entrust private factories to process or order goods from private factories, the cost calculation of processing fees or prices has not been calculated according to the medium standard of general factories under reasonable operating conditions, but according to the level of production technology of each factory, resulting in unreasonable processing fees. Because these factories' own production management is unreasonable, the product cost is relatively increased, the processing fee is increased, and the state-owned enterprises' leadership in improving private enterprises has not played a role in improving the production and operation management of private factories. Second, some state-owned enterprises lack planning in entrusting private factories to process and order goods. Most of the processing and ordering are entrusted to large factories. After the large factories accept the orders, they cannot do it and entrust it to small factories, adding a layer of intermediate exploitation, while some small factories have nothing to do. In addition, in commissioned processing and ordering, not enough consideration is given to manufacturers who have completed public debt and tax tasks. Third, some state-owned specialized companies simply proceed from taking care of private factories in acquisition and processing, intentionally or unintentionally forming "harming the public for the benefit of the private." The Municipal Department Store purchased Foshan silk satin. In order to take care of the manufacturers' difficulties, it did not pay attention to the poor quality and high price of the silk satin. As a result, it spent more than 10 billion yuan to purchase more than 4,500 bolts of silk satin, which still cannot be sold. Fourth, some state-owned specialized companies lack investigation and research and supervision when entrusting private factories to process, resulting in unnecessary losses. The Municipal Grain Company entrusted a rice mill to process grain, but did not understand that the factory was an illegitimate one, resulting in the sale of 130,000 catties of grain by the factory. In addition, the company entrusted more than 10 rice mills to process grain, stating that 68 catties of rice would be delivered for every 100 catties of grain, of which half a catty of rice would be extracted from the by-products to make up the difference, but the rice mills swallowed the by-products and sold the Grain Company's grain to offset the shortfall. The Grain Company's inspection and supervision were not thorough enough, and it was once fooled, losing a lot of grain. Fifth, some state-owned enterprises did not specify the quality and standards of products when entrusting private factories to process and order goods, or they did specify them, but the private factories did not abide by the contract provisions, resulting in phenomena such as cutting corners and shoddy manufacturing. Therefore, many disputes arose between the two parties during delivery, hindering mutual trust and cooperation between public and private enterprises. Sixth, some state-owned enterprises set strict standards and low processing fees for commissioned processing, and private factories lost money once. The second time they processed, they did not keep their promises and ran away with the money. Individual private factories closed down due to processing losses. Seventh, some state-owned specialized companies do not adequately take care of the legitimate profits of private enterprises when formulating prices. In order to support the development of cooperatives, the Municipal Grain Company entrusted cooperatives to sell grain at a price lower than the price entrusted to private merchants (this is correct), but the cooperatives did not distinguish between members and non-members, and sold grain at a price lower than the price of consignment stores (about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan lower per dan), which affected the business development of consignment stores. The Municipal Grain Company failed to correct this phenomenon in time. The Municipal Department Store exchanged yarn with the Li Yuxing Factory for a batch of knitted shirts. In order to take care of its own sales only, the selling price of each piece was 3,000 yuan lower than the selling price of the Li Yuxing Factory, which affected the sales of the Li Yuxing Factory's knitted shirts. All these phenomena have caused some private merchants to doubt the government's policy of uniting private merchants.

　　In short, there is still a chaotic phenomenon in Guangzhou City's current adjustment of public and private industrial and commercial relations. This phenomenon hinders the implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests. The basic way to overcome this phenomenon is to first establish a unified organization and leadership, master the processing and ordering affairs, and all processing and ordering of state-owned enterprises must be managed and distributed through the organization. The Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the trade associations need to assist in the process. In this way, processing and ordering can be reasonably distributed to private factories in a planned way, avoiding state-owned enterprises from having their own sets of rules and lack of coordination in processing and ordering; it can also avoid disputes between public and private manufacturers and the loopholes exploited by private factories. Second, the staff of state-owned enterprises must step up their study of documents on adjusting public-private relations, clearly understand the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, and overcome overly right-leaning practices: recognize that indiscriminate care without principle will inevitably harm the public for the benefit of the private and increase the burden on the government and itself; overcome overly "leftist" practices: recognize that mastering price policies and determining processing conditions without taking care of the reasonable profits of private enterprises are underestimating the importance of private enterprises in the New Democratic economy and their proper position in the overall economy. Third, commissioned processing, ordering, and acquisition involve many complex business knowledge. The staff of state-owned enterprises must go deep into their work, get close to the masses, and learn with an open mind. If the work of adjusting public-private relations can be done well, then the role of the state-owned economy in leading the private economy can be brought into play.

　　广州调整工商业及存在的几个问题
    本报特派记者  古维进
    被帝国主义和官僚资本长期垄断摧残的广州市工商业，在解放以后，因为尚未经过改造，以及交通运销尚未顺畅，所以产品的销路与原料的供给均未能得到解决。今年三月以后，物价稳定，虚假购买力消失，产销也就更感困难了。面对这种情况，国营企业根据中央人民政府调整工商业的方针，采取委托加工、定货、收购等形式，初步解决了部分私营企业的销路和原料的问题。中南军区军需三局的被服厂、橡胶厂、鞋厂、材料厂，曾以大量原料交给私营工厂加工，去年底至今年五月，约付出加工费四百六十余亿元，有一百多家工厂得以继续维持生产。华南粮食公司与市粮食公司，一月至五月，共委托三十一家私营碾谷厂碾谷五千余万市斤。这些厂子几乎有一半的生产是依靠粮食公司的委托加工。四、五月间，市百货公司曾以近百件纱向三十余个厂子交换针织品及化工制品，以三十余件纱委托合作社、织布厂加工制造毛巾、蚊帐布等。该公司代销私营厂子的成品由二十九家增至三十五家。省百货公司五月份曾与四十家私营工厂订立了代销和采购合同，六月份又决定以全部资金的百分之七十通过收购、定货等形式，扶助私营企业生产。广州市花纱布分公司自一月至六月上半月共收购私营纺织厂的布约一万匹，加上推动私商收购大批布匹，电机织布厂已有部分复工生产。三月份，市人民银行鉴于纺织业的产品销路困难，曾拿出七亿余元收购该业的冬布和部分夏布共三千六百余匹。当物价稳定，银根紧缩，私营企业正感于资金周转困难时，市人民银行积极举办贷款，计工业贷款四十四亿元以上，贸易贷款一亿一千万元。最近该行为进一步的扶助私营工商业的恢复与发展，决定发放贷款四百亿元。
    国营企业采取上述一系列的积极措施后，穗市部分正当工商业已开始呈现复苏。据统计：工业申请开业的四月至六月上半月共六十八户，批准开业的共四十六户；商业申请开业的四月至六月上半月共四百三十二户，批准开业的共二百六十六户。其中以有利于国计民生的进出口业、纺织业、印刷业、运输业为多。此外，过去申请停业而现在继续开业或转业的尚有一百多家。
    在国营企业扶助私营工商业的过程中，曾经发生了许多问题。这些问题是应该而且必须加以合理解决的。
    首先是有些国营企业委托私营工厂加工或向私厂定货时，加工费或货价的成本计算，尚未依照一般工厂在合理经营条件下的中等标准来计算，而是依照各个工厂生产技术的高低来计算，以致加工费呈现了不合理的现象。因为这些工厂本身生产管理的不合理，相对地增加了产品成本，提高了加工费，且使国营企业领导私营企业的改进并未起到改进私营工厂生产和经营管理的作用。第二是有些国营企业委托私营工厂加工、定货缺乏计划性。加工、定货大部是委托大厂进行，大厂接受后干不了就委托小厂干，从中增加了一层中间剥削，而有些小厂却没有事干。此外，在委托加工、定货中，对于完成公债和税收任务的厂商照顾不够。第三是有些国营专业公司在收购和加工上单纯从照顾私营工厂出发，有意无意的形成了“因私害公”。市百货公司收购佛山纱绸，为了照顾厂家的困难不注意纱绸的质量差和价钱高，结果花了十余亿元收购了四千五百余匹纱绸，至今尚无法推销。第四是有些国营专业公司委托私营工厂加工，缺乏调查研究和检查督促，以致遭受了不应有的损失。市粮食公司委托一家碾米厂加工，不了解该厂是不正当的厂家，致十三万斤粮食被该厂卖掉了。另外，该公司委托十余家碾米厂加工，言明一百斤谷交六十八斤米，其中有半斤米是从副产品里面提出来补足的，但是碾米厂把副产品吞掉，卖掉粮食公司的粮食抵补。粮食公司检查督促不够深入，曾被蒙混过去，损失了不少粮食。第五是有些国营企业委托私营工厂加工、定货未曾讲好产品的质量和标准，或已经讲好而私营工厂不遵守合同规定，产生了偷工减料，粗制滥造等现象，因而在交货时双方发生了许多纠纷，妨碍了公私企业双方互相信任和分工合作。第六是有些国营企业委托私营工厂加工把标准定的较严，加工费定的较低，私厂赔了一次本，第二次加工时，不讲信用，挟款逃跑。有个别私营工厂则因加工赔本关了门。第七是有些国营专业公司制订价格时，对私营企业的合法利润照顾不足。市粮食公司为了扶助合作社发展，委托合作社代售粮食的价格低于委托私商代售店代售的价格（这是对的），但合作社却不分社员与非社员，一律以低于代售店的价格出售（每担粮食约低二三千元），影响了代售店的业务开展。市粮食公司对此种现象却未能及时纠正。市百货公司以纱和李裕兴厂交换线衫一批，为了只顾自己销售，每件售价低于李裕兴厂的售价三千元，李裕兴厂的线衫销售受到影响。所有这些现象，引起一些私商对政府团结私商的政策发生怀疑。
    总之，目前穗市调整公私工商业关系，尚存在一种混乱现象。此种现象，妨碍着公私兼顾政策的贯彻。克服此种现象的基本办法，首先要建立统一的组织和领导，掌握加工、定货事宜，凡属国营企业的加工、定货，均需通过该组织的经管分配，工商联、总工会、同业公会等均需协助进行。这样，可以有计划的把加工、定货向私营工厂合理分配，而避免国营企业在加工、定货时各据一套，互不协调；又可以避免公私营厂商的争执与私营工厂的钻空子。第二，国营企业的工作人员，必须加紧学习调整公私关系的文件，明确认识公私兼顾的政策，克服过右的作法：认识无原则的单纯照顾，势必因私害公，增加政府与本身的负担；克服过“左”的作法：认识掌握价格政策和确定加工条件不照顾私营企业的合理利润，都是轻视了私营企业在新民主主义经济中的重要性和它在整个经济中应有的地位。第三，委托加工、定货和收购等，包括许多复杂的业务知识，国营企业的工作人员，必须深入工作，接近群众，虚心学习。如果能将调整公私关系的工作作好，则国营经济领导私营经济的作用也就能够发挥起来。
