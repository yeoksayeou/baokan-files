　　"The U.S. Air Force Is Not Scary"
    ——Interviews with Several New China Air Force Personnel – Who Defected from the Kuomintang Air Force and Were Trained Alongside the U.S. Air Force.
    On one hand, the U.S. Air Force boasts and brags about the strength of its aerial fortresses, and on the other hand, U.S.-made planes are shot down on the land of the Korean people. For the generals of U.S. imperialism, this is truly an ironic picture. To this end, I interviewed pilots and mechanics who bravely defected from the Kuomintang reactionaries, had been trained with the U.S. Air Force in the United States, and are now serving in the New China Air Force.
    Mechanic Feng Ruisheng first exposed the actual effectiveness of American aircraft: The U.S.-made B-24 aircraft, which the U.S. itself claims can fly at an altitude of 38,000 feet, in reality, after Feng Ruisheng's many tests, never exceeded an altitude of 30,000 feet even in the clearest weather. Generally, mechanical operation became very difficult at 25,000 feet. After reflection, Feng Ruisheng came to the conclusion, he said: "This not only exposes the American society, which is always and everywhere full of commercially exaggerated propaganda, but also clearly depicts how the imperialist warmongers want to decorate themselves as more frightening paper tigers to intimidate peace-loving people."
    Why is it that the seemingly impressive U.S. Air Force is actually so vulnerable in combat? This is because justice is never on the side of imperialism, and imperialist warmongers have no choice but to use "nude dances" to motivate their soldiers. Pilot Zhou Yuancai personally witnessed this kind of propaganda: American warmongers would either tell their soldiers how beautiful the women were in the places they were going to invade, or what delicious things there were to eat. He said: "This time, when the U.S. Air Force went to fight in Korea, wasn't it also promoting how delicious the Korean apples were? However, it is never worth exchanging one's life for apples, and American soldiers are smarter than anyone in this regard. Therefore, they often choose to retreat as the best option." Because of this, the U.S. imperialist warmongers are most troubled. Therefore, they have had to stipulate that air force personnel can retire or work in the rear after completing a certain number of sorties. Yu Qingrong said: "The U.S. Air Force pursues the number of sorties in combat, not the combat effect." He used another example to prove his point. When he was at Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas, he heard an American flight instructor tell his air force students: "When encountering enemy aircraft, it is best to fire once and run away. If you shoot down an enemy aircraft, you earn one; if you don't, you can still come back alive." This is how American junior air force officers train their lackeys. Fan Jichun continued: "Often because the fighters fire once and quickly run away, the unprotected bombers are left behind clumsily to be hit." This is the real reason why most of the aircraft shot down by the Korean People's Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery are heavy bombers, including B-29s and B-38s.
    The pilots expressed extreme anger at the U.S. imperialist aggressive act of sending the Seventh Fleet to obstruct our army from liberating Taiwan. The aerial warriors said with indignation and determination: "The U.S. Seventh Fleet can only increase the difficulty of our liberation of Taiwan, but it can never prevent the liberation of Taiwan. We must improve our political consciousness while further improving our flying skills, so that we can victoriously cover our brother troops in landing safely on Taiwan, complete the complete liberation of the motherland, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. imperialist paper tiger, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak." Mechanic Feng Ruisheng also expressed the determination of every mechanic. He said: "During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, ten out of twenty aircraft could not take off. Now, in order to oppose wars of aggression and defend world peace, we are determined to ensure that every aircraft of the people can take off."

　　“美国空军并不可怕”
    ——访问几位新中国的空军人员——他们是从国民党空军中起义过来的，曾和美国空军一起受过训练。
    一方面是美国空军叫嚣着和吹嘘着空中堡垒的强大，一方面是一架架美式飞机被击落在朝鲜人民的土地上。对于美帝国主义的将军们说来，这真是一幅难以描绘的讽刺画。为此，我访问了从国民党反动派那边勇敢地起义过来、曾经在美国同美国空军在一起受过训练、现在是新中国的飞行员和机械员们。
    机械员冯锐生首先揭穿了美国飞机的实际效能：美帝自己宣传可作三万八千英尺高空飞行的美制Ｂ——２４型机，实际上，经过冯锐生多次的试验，就是在最晴朗的天气里，也从来没有一架超过三万英尺的高空，一般的在二万五千英尺时，机械操作便感到了很大的困难。冯锐生经过回想之后，得到了结论，他说：“这不仅暴露了美国社会随时随地充满了商业性的过分夸大的宣传，同时，也显明地刻画出，帝国主义战争贩子们，如何想把自己本身这个纸老虎装璜得更加可怕，来恫吓爱好和平的人民。”
    为什么样子上神气活现的美国空军，实际上打起仗来却不堪一击呢？这是因为正义从来不在帝国主义那一边，帝国主义战争贩子们，便只好用“裸体舞”来动员他们的士兵们。飞行员周远材亲眼看到过这种宣传方式：美国战争贩子对他们的士兵不是宣传说要去侵略的地方的女子多么漂亮，便是说有什么好吃的东西。他说：“这次美国空军到朝鲜去作战，不是又宣传朝鲜的苹果多么好吃么？可是，拿性命去换苹果总是不合算的，美国兵在这一点上比谁都聪明。所以，常常是三十六着走为上着了。”由于这样，美帝国主义战争贩子们最感到头痛了。因此，又不得不规定空军在完成一定数字的出击飞行任务时就可退伍或作后方工作。禹庆荣说：“美国空军在作战时，追求的是出击次数，不是战斗效果。”他以另一个实例来证明自己的话。他在美国德克萨斯州的好人机场时，曾听到一个美国飞行教官向空军学生们说：“遇到敌机时，最好打一下就跑，打下敌机来赚一个；打不下来自己也可以活着回来。”美国的下级空军军官就是这样来训练他的喽囉们的。范纪纯接着说：“常常因为战斗机打一下就很快地跑掉了，没有掩护的轰炸机便笨重地留下来挨打。”这就是为什么被朝鲜人民空军和高射炮打落的多半是包括Ｂ—２９、Ｂ—３８在内的重型轰炸机的真实原因。
    飞行员们对于美帝出动第七舰队阻挠我军解放台湾的侵略行动，表示异常的愤怒。空中战士们愤慨而又坚定地说：“美国的第七舰队只能增多我们解放台湾的困难，决不可能阻止台湾的解放。我们要在提高自己政治觉悟的同时，更加练好飞行技术，以便将来胜利地掩护兄弟部队安全登陆台湾，完成祖国的全部解放，把美帝这个外强中干的纸老虎彻底打败。”机械员冯锐生也说出了每一个机械员的决心。他说：“在国民党反动统治的时候，二十架飞机中总有十架不能起飞，现在我们为了反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平，我们坚决保证人民的飞机有一架就能起飞一架。”
