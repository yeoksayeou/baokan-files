Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st: The Literary Gazette prominently published an article by Ivanov entitled "What is Happening in Taiwan?". Ivanov said: Taiwan has become the last stronghold of the Chinese reactionaries—the Kuomintang clique. Here, Chiang Kai-shek and his lackeys are attempting to maintain their rule. Here, American imperialists are frantically continuing to weave a bloody web of conspiracies against the Chinese people. Ivanov pointed out that the economy of Taiwan—the sugar bowl of the East—is now in a state of decline. The sugar industry has been restricted; Taiwan has a population of only seven million, while the number of unemployed has reached 800,000. One-third of the three hundred small enterprises have stopped work, while the rest are struggling to survive. American bandits and their Kuomintang henchmen rule everything they can get their hands on.

Ivanov pointed out: The more difficult the situation on the island, the more the Kuomintang, incited by the Americans, clamors against free China in a tone of revenge. Bestial hatred—that is the driving force behind their malicious plans. In their impotent rage, they clamor for air raids on the cities of free China, and the Americans are happy to put weapons in the hands of these murderers. Under the guidance of the Americans, the bankrupt Kuomintang elements are drawing up a broad plan for organizing armed intervention against free China with great enthusiasm.

Chiang Kai-shek is drafting new plans to place China under the enslavement of Wall Street. These plans are arrogant because they will not be realized. At this time, American expatriates are lording it over the island of Taiwan. On American orders, Wu Kuo-cheng, the former mayor of Shanghai and a former student of American universities, was appointed provincial governor, and Sun Li-jen was appointed commander of the defense of Taiwan. He also has a long-standing relationship with the Americans.

Approximately two hundred American missionaries are distributed throughout the island. They are engaged in corrupting the people and, at the same time, carrying out espionage on a large scale. The Americans have their own armed "defense" forces in Taipei, which also include Japanese, including former commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Neji Okamura.

Ivanov continued: The Chinese people of Taiwan are brave, resolute, patriotic, and freedom-loving people. No matter how cruel the persecution of Chiang Kai-shek and his petty tyrants, they cannot destroy the freedom-loving spirit of the Taiwanese people. On this island, there are groups of warriors and patriots fighting for freedom, and they are fighting against the Chiang Kai-shek clique and their American masters.

Ivanov concluded by saying: Although the United States continues to provide extensive assistance to the Kuomintang, even in the minds of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and their masters in Taiwan, the thought of collapse and failure is always present. Not only that, but the question of directly occupying Taiwan has constantly become a topic of discussion in the imperialist newspapers. Now, President Truman has ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to "prevent any attack on Taiwan"; in reality, this is the occupation of a part of Chinese territory. This provocative behavior of the American imperialists, unprecedented in the history of international relations, has aroused the anger of the great Chinese people and all progressive humanity. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, has said: "The Chinese people will surely be able to victoriously drive out the American aggressors and recover Taiwan and all territories belonging to China."

　　苏文学报评台湾局势
    美帝的挑衅行为，已激起伟大中国人民和一切进步人类的愤怒
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：文学报以显著地位登载了伊凡诺夫的一篇论文，题为：“台湾发生了什么事情？”。伊凡诺夫说：台湾已成为中国反动分子——国民党集团——的最后据点。在这里，蒋介石及其奴才们正企图保持他们的统治。在这里，美国帝国主义分子疯狂地继续编织着反对中国人民的血腥阴谋之网。伊凡诺夫指出：台湾——东方的糖盆——的经济现在正处于下降的状态。食糖工业遭到了限制；台湾只有七百万人口，而失业人数竟达八十万。三百种小型企业中，有三分之一停了工，而其余正在苟延残喘之中。美国的强盗及他们的国民党走卒，统治了一切他们能够到手的东西。
    伊凡诺夫指出：该岛的局势愈是困难，则受美国人鼓动的国民党人就愈是以复仇的语调来对自由中国发出叫嚣。兽性的憎恨——这就是他们恶毒计划的推动力量。在他们无能为力的狂怒中，他们叫嚣要空袭自由中国的城市，而美国人也很乐于将枪刀放在这些杀人凶手们的手里。在美国人的指导下，国民党的破产者们正以极大的热忱来拟订一个对自由中国组织武装干涉的广泛计划。
    蒋介石正草拟把中国放在华尔街奴役之下的新计划，这些计划由于它们的不会实现而成为狂妄的计划，正在这个时候，美国侨民们都正在台湾岛上作威作福。依照美国人的命令，前上海市长、过去美国大学的学生吴国桢出任省主席，而孙立人亦被任命为防守台湾的司令官。他也是与美国人有着长期打交道的关系的。
    约有二百个美国传教士分布在该岛各地。他们在那里从事腐化人民的工作并同时大规模地进行间谍活动。美国人在台北有他们自己的武装的“国防”部队，在部队中也有日本人，包括前驻华北派遣军司令官根本博在内。
    伊凡诺夫继续写道：台湾的中国人民都是勇毅、坚决、爱国、爱自由的人民。不管蒋介石及其小暴君们的迫害是如何的残忍，但总不能摧毁台湾人民爱好自由的精神。在这个岛上，存在着为自由而斗争的战士与爱国者们的团体，他们正在对蒋介石集团及其美国主子们进行着斗争。
    伊凡诺夫在结语中称：尽管美国现在继续给国民党以广大的援助，但即在台湾蒋介石集团及其主子们的脑海中，仍然经常地存在着崩溃与失败的思想。不仅如此：直接占领台湾的问题已不断成为帝国主义报纸讨论的题目。而现在，杜鲁门总统已命令美国第七舰队“防止对台湾的任何攻击”；实际上，这就是占领中国领土的一部分。在国际关系史上前所未有的美国帝国主义分子的这种挑衅性行为，已激起伟大中国人民以及一切进步人类的愤怒。中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来已经说过：“中国人民必能胜利地驱逐美国侵略者，收复台湾和一切属于中国的领土。”
