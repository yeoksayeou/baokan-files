    — A Communist Party Member on the Front Line

    5. Little He was ordered by the company commander to bandage Yang Jintang's wound, but he was directed to find the squad leader and ask him to quickly send some hand grenades up.

    6. The enemy rushed out of the bunker again, and hand grenades exploded into a blaze of fire on the grave mounds. Two soldiers were wounded. Yang Jintang's leg was wounded and his trousers were stained with blood, but his Tommy gun did not stop firing. He threw three hand grenades over, and the enemy never shouted again.

    7. Yang Jintang's Tommy gun was crisp and tenacious, and this sound encouraged hundreds of shovels in the entire battalion. The soldiers took off their cotton coats and dug vigorously, and the communication trench gradually stretched and approached the enemy's bunker.

    8. As Yang Jintang—a glorious Communist Party member—fainted three times in a pool of blood, the entire battalion successfully completed the approach operation; brotherly units launched an attack from this advantageous position and annihilated all the enemy defenders of Chen Village in just twenty minutes at a very small cost.

    5、小贺奉连长命令去给杨金堂包扎伤口，但被他指挥下来找班长，要班长快送几个手榴弹上去。
    6、敌人又从地堡里冲出来，手榴弹在墳包上炸成一片火光，两战士负伤，杨金堂腿上负伤血染一裤子，但他的汤姆式没有停止射击，他扔过去三个手榴弹，敌人再也不呌了。
    7、杨金堂的汤姆式清脆而顽强，这声音鼓舞着全营数百把铁锹，战士们脱下棉衣起劲地挖着，交通壕渐渐向敌人的地堡伸长接近。
    8、当杨金堂——光荣的共产党员三次负伤晕倒在血泊中的同时，全营顺利完成了迫近作业；兄弟连队从这有利阵地上发起攻击，以极微小代价，仅二十分钟时间歼灭陈庄全部守敌。
