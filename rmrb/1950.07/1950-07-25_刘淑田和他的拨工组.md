　　Liu Shutian and Her Work Exchange Group

　　Liu Shutian, a nineteen-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League from Beiyaoshan Village, Fourth District, Wan County, Hebei Province, comes from a poor family. Twelve people in her family cultivated only nine mu of land. The grain they harvested each year was only enough to eat for half a year. Her older brother was a good worker and worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord in Nanyaoshan Village. Only her father, in his fifties, took care of the farm work during busy seasons. In the slack season, he did odd jobs to earn some money to supplement the family's expenses. Since childhood, Shutian helped her father hoe the fields, cultivate the land, and pick up stones. By the age of fifteen, she had learned all the work. The masses all said that Shutian was a capable girl.

　　After the land reform, she was allocated eight mu of land. Her brother, who had been liberated, no longer worked as a long-term laborer. The two siblings went out early and returned late every day to actively engage in production. Some young people said, "Shutian is really a good worker, not afraid of mud or water!" Some older uncles and aunts said, "She's really a silly girl, she's about to get married, but she doesn't prepare any clothes and still works so hard!" But Shutian explained to them, "As long as you work hard, you won't have to worry about clothes or food wherever you go."

　　Because Shutian was active in production, she was admitted to the Communist Youth League. After being educated by the League, she knew that she should not only be active in production herself but also motivate others. She made a plan and decided to find women with labor shortages, Shi Fenghua, Cui Shutian, and Cui Huating, to discuss it. At first, they were reluctant. For example, Shi Fenghua said, "If I participate in the work exchange, I won't be able to do the work at home in a timely manner." Some were afraid of being too tired after participating in the work exchange, saying, "We don't know how to plow or plant, and we don't know how to use a large hoe. How can we work with you?!" But after Shutian explained everything and cleared their minds, they started the work exchange last spring. They spun yarn during the slack season and went to the fields during the busy season, often working together and persisting until now. They also established a system of recording labor and keeping accounts. Since Shi Fenghua participated in the work exchange, the work at home was not only not delayed but also became very organized. Her father happily said, "I am benefiting from the children. In the past, one or two mu of land were always left uncultivated. This year, there is not even a single weed in the field, and with their help, topdressing was applied, and the eighteen mu of land yielded more than two dan of grain." Moreover, they all learned how to hoe the land with large hoes, and Fenghua also learned how to plow. Under their motivation, all twenty-eight young women in the village actively participated in production, eighteen of them participated in the work exchange, and even the fifty-year-old women Ma Jinrong and Liu Shishi organized to work together. The masses in the village all said, "In ancient times, there was Mu Guiying, and our village has Liu Shutian."

　　They not only do a good job in production but are also active in learning. This year, during the wheat harvest, fearing that it would affect their studies, Liu Shutian came up with a method: they slept together at night to learn characters; during breaks from wheat harvesting during the day, everyone practiced. In this way, they achieved both production and learning. Now, after more than a year of active learning, they all recognize around six hundred characters. They have also learned a lot of scientific knowledge about production. Under their propaganda and mobilization, sixty of the 121 households in the village implemented seed soaking, and eighty households implemented seed selection (a total of twenty-five dan of wheat seeds were selected this year). They did everything first. For example, this year, no one had confidence in controlling cotton aphids, so Liu Shutian took the lead in treating them first and also helped Liu Jindong treat one mu (using tobacco water), which resulted in motivating all the villagers. All four hundred mu of cotton in the village have been weeded five times and are now being pruned. Because Liu Shutian is very active in work, production, and learning, the village Communist Party branch has admitted her as a probationary member of the Communist Party, the village Communist Youth League committee has rated her as a model member, and the people's school has also selected her as a learning model.

　　刘淑田和他的拨工组
    河北省完县四区北腰山村青年妇女团员刘淑田，今年十九岁。小时她家中很穷，十二口人只种九亩地。每年打的粮食仅够半年吃。哥哥是个好劳动，给南腰山村地主扛长活。家中只有五十多岁的爹爹在农忙时照顾生产。农闲做小买卖挣几个钱补充家中零用。淑田从小帮助爹锄地、耕地、拾石头，到十五岁上就什么活也学会了。群众们都说淑田是个能干的闺女。
    土改后分得了八亩地。翻了身的哥哥也不做长活了，兄妹二人每天早出晚归地积极生产，一些年青的人都说：“淑田真是好劳动，泥里水里都不怕！”一些老大伯老大妈们则说：“真是个傻丫头，眼看着快要出嫁啦，也不准备做些衣服，还是那么傻干！”但淑田向他们解释说：“只要动手干活，到那去也不愁穿的、吃的。”
    由于淑田生产积极，被吸收为青年团员。经过团的教育，她知道了不但自己要积极生产，还要带动别人。她做了个计划，决定找缺劳动力的妇女石凤花、崔树田、崔花亭来商量。起初，他们都不乐意，如石凤花说：“参加了拨工，家里的活便不能及时干啦。”有的怕参加了拨工累的慌，说：“我们不会耕耩，又不会使大锄，怎么和你在一块拨呀？！”但经淑田一一解释，打通了她们的思想。在去年春天开始了拨工。农闲纺线，农忙下地，经常一块生产坚持到现在了。并建立了清工记账制。石凤花自参加拨工后，家里的活不但没耽误，并且很有条理。她父亲很喜欢地说：“我算沾了孩子们的光，往年总是荒个一二亩地，今年地里连一棵草也没有，并且在她们帮助下上了追肥，十八亩地多打了两石多粮食”。并且她们都学会了用大锄耪地，凤花也会耕地了。在她们的带动下，全村二十八个青年妇女都积极参加了生产，十八人参加了拨工，连五十岁的老大妈马金荣和刘史氏也组织到一块生产。全村群众都说：“古时候出了个穆桂英，咱村出了个刘淑田。”
    她们不但生产搞的好，学习也很积极。今年麦收时怕影响学习，刘淑田就想了一个办法：晚上在一块睡觉，学生字；白天拔麦休息时，大家练习。这样做到了生产学习二不误。现在她们经过一年多的积极学习，都认识六百字上下了。并且还懂得了许多的生产科学知识。在她们宣传动员下，全村一百二十一户中有六十户实行了浸种，八十户实行了选种（今年共选二十五石麦种）。一切活她们都做在头里。如今年治棉蚜虫，谁也没信心，刘淑田就带头先治，还帮助刘金栋治了一亩（用烟草水治），结果把全村群众都带动起来。全村四百多亩棉花，都已锄过五遍，现正整枝打杈。由于刘淑田工作、生产、学习很积极，该村中共支部已吸收她为中共候补党员，村团委会评她为模范团员，民校还选她为学习模范。
