　　To all commanders and soldiers of the Korean People's Army:
    Your motherland suffered decades of oppression under the rule of Japanese invaders, and the pain and suffering you endured were profound!
    After the heroic Soviet Red Army defeated the fascist Japanese invaders, the northern half of your motherland was liberated. However, the American running dog, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, relied on its master to betray your country and nation, and to undermine the peaceful reunification of your motherland, attempting to make your motherland a colony of American imperialism once again. With American instigation and assistance, they brazenly launched an anti-people civil war, and the United States then launched an armed invasion of your territory, barbarously massacring the Korean people. But in less than a month of war, under your heroic battles, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has collapsed, with those annihilated being annihilated, those surrendering surrendering, and many areas being liberated. The American invading army is also no match for you, retreating again and again. We believe that any assistance from the United States to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang will not stop your advance, and the death of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is doomed. Final victory will surely belong to the Korean people. We are here with boundless joy, celebrating your great victory, and extending brotherly greetings. We wish you heroic struggle to accelerate the elimination of the remaining enemy, to expel American imperialism, to strive for the independence and reunification of the Korean people, and for world peace.

　　写给朝鲜人民军朝鲜人民军全体指战员：
    你们祖国曾在日寇统治下受了数十年的压迫，所受的痛苦与磨难是深重的！
    当英勇的苏联红军打败了法西斯日寇之后，你们的祖国的北半部便随之得到了解放。但美国走狗李承晚匪帮，却依靠其主子，出卖你们的国家民族，破坏你们祖国的和平统一，企图使你们的祖国重沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。在美国唆使与帮助下，悍然发动反人民内战，美国继即武装侵略你们的国土，野蛮的屠杀朝鲜人民。但战争不到一月，在你们的英勇战斗下，李承晚匪帮已土崩瓦解，被歼的被歼，投降的投降，许多地区得到了解放，美国侵略军也打不过你们，一退再退。我们相信美国对李承晚匪帮的任何援助是阻止不了你们的前进的，李承晚匪帮的死亡是注定了的。最后的胜利一定属于朝鲜人民。我们在这里以无限的欢欣，庆祝你们的伟大胜利，并致以兄弟的敬礼。祝你们为加速消灭残敌驱逐美帝国主义，争取朝鲜人民独立统一及为全世界和平而英勇奋斗。
