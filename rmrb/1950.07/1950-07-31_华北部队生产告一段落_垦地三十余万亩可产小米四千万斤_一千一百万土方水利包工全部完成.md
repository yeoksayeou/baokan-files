　　North China Troops Complete Production Phase
	Over 300,000 Mu of Land Reclaimed, Estimated Yield of 40 Million Jin of Millet; 11 Million Cubic Meters of Earthwork for Water Conservancy Projects Fully Completed
	[This Newspaper Reports] According to the principle of prioritizing agricultural production in military production, the troops of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have actively engaged in agricultural production and, by late June, have completed a phase. Except for a small number of personnel remaining on the farms for daily management, all troops have returned to their original defense posts for reorganization and training. Throughout the year, the entire military region has reclaimed over 300,000 mu of water and dry land (Editor's note: It was reported at the end of May as being over 210,000 mu, because the statistics for several units, such as the Suiyuan Military Region, were not included at that time), distributed across a vast area from Bohai Bay to Suiyuan, from Chabei to the banks of the Yellow River. Crops such as rice, cotton, beans, flaxseed, peanuts, sorghum, corn, and vegetables have been planted. Some spring wheat and vegetables have already been harvested, and the rest have fully emerged and are growing well. It is estimated that this year's yield will be equivalent to approximately 40 million jin of millet.
	During the production process, most units have practiced intensive cultivation. Whether it is paddy field or dry land, plowing has been done more than twice. Many paddy fields in Bohai Bay have undergone more than two rounds of alkali washing (because the local soil is mostly alkaline). Many paddy field farms have also built irrigation projects such as canals and sluice gates. One unit cultivated over 12,000 mu of paddy fields, excavated 279,900 cubic meters of earth for canals, and built 50 sluice gates, 3 dams, and 45 bridges.
	Due to a lack of technical skills and experience, the soldiers have consciously and actively studied production techniques. For example, before transplanting rice seedlings, one farm invited experienced old farmers to give reports and hold discussions in groups. During transplanting, the old farmers gave demonstrations, and the troops observed and learned before starting to transplant. During the transplanting process, one unit assessed the neatness, evenness, and depth of the rice seedlings transplanted each day against standards after work, promptly exchanging experiences, so that the rice transplanting techniques improved day by day, and on average, each person could transplant nearly one mu of land per day.
	Under centralized and unified leadership, the troops' production adopted a collective division of labor management method. For example, the management of paddy field farms involves dividing the production personnel into several specialized teams, such as ditch digging, land cultivation, and seedling raising, under unified leadership, with each team responsible for specific tasks, coordinating labor, and adopting a planned and guided collective division of labor, which greatly improved labor efficiency.
	Recently, individual farms have discovered pests, and some paddy fields are at risk of flooding. All units have paid attention to prevention and control.
	[Another News Item] The water conservancy projects contracted by the troops of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army were all completed by late June. The various units have completed excavation, canal opening, dam construction, and renovation projects totaling over 11 million cubic meters of earthwork on more than 20 rivers in the vast area of North China, including the Yongding River, Hai River, Luan River, Hutuo River, Sanggan River, and Chaobai River. This has greatly helped the country's water conservancy and agricultural construction. For example, the river dredging project in the lower reaches of the Chaobai River, completed by the troops and civilian laborers together, can spare the people of eight counties in eastern Hebei from the threat of floods year after year. The large canal built by the troops in southern Chahar on the Sanggan River, which is 300 li long, can turn 500,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields (150,000 mu can be irrigated this year). The People's Liberation Army, who contracted for the projects, received warm praise and慰劳 from the local government and people.
	Before starting work, the units undertaking the task of contracting for water conservancy projects conducted more than half a month of production education. Under centralized and unified leadership, the commanders and fighters consciously displayed high production enthusiasm and initiative, continuously improved labor organization and production technology, and overcame the difficulties of lacking material conditions and experience, thus continuously improving production efficiency. During the labor, the units generally exceeded the original plan of excavating 1.5 to 3 cubic meters of earth per person per day. Soldier Liu Jinfa of a certain unit even set a record of excavating 17 cubic meters of earth per day; the Second Battalion of a certain unit maintained an average record of 7.7 cubic meters of earth per person per day. General production efficiency exceeded that of civilian laborers by 25 to 250 percent. Therefore, the projects contracted by the various units of the entire military region were completed half a month or 20 days ahead of schedule. Under strict supervision and inspection, the quality of the projects generally met the engineering requirements and standards. For example, the dike-building troops of the Hebei Military Region especially emphasized that the rammed earth project should be "rammed firmly, not for speed," achieving layer-by-layer ramming, with a general soil pad of 1.3 feet, rammed down 4 inches, meeting the requirements and standards of the River Affairs Bureau. A certain unit that contracted for the construction of a 390,000 cubic meter soil embankment in the lower reaches of the Chaobai River received an award from the engineering office of the river for the solid and standard nature of the project.

　　华北部队生产告一段落
    垦地三十余万亩可产小米四千万斤
    一千一百万土方水利包工全部完成
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区部队根据军队生产以农业为主的方针，积极经营农业生产，到六月下旬，已告一段落。除在农场留少数人员负责日常管理外，各部队已返回原防整训。全年全军区部队共开垦水、旱地三十余万亩（编者按：五月底曾报导为二十一万余亩，因当时未将绥远军区等几个单位统计在内），分布在渤海湾到绥远，察北到黄河岸的广大地区。种植了水稻、棉花、豆类、麻子、花生、高粱、玉米及蔬菜等作物，现部分春麦和蔬菜已经收割，其余均出了全苗，生长良好，估计今年产量折合小米约四千余万斤。
    各单位在生产中，大都做到精耕细作，无论水地或旱地，耕垡都在两遍以上。渤海湾的许多稻田，更进行了两遍以上的洗碱工作（因当地土质多含碱性）。很多稻田农场，还修建了水渠、水闸等灌溉工程。某部耕种稻田一万二千多亩，修水渠共挖土达二十七万九千九百多立方，并修建水闸五十个，水坝三道、桥梁四十五座。
    因为缺乏技术和经验，战士们还自觉自动地来研究生产技术。如某农场在插稻秧前，先请有经验的老农作了报告，分班讨论研究；插秧时先请老农作了示范，部队参观学习，然后动手插秧。某部在插秧过程中，每天收工后对一天所插稻秧的整齐、均匀和深浅程度根据标准进行评定，及时地交流了经验，使稻秧技术一天比一天提高，平均每人每天可以插秧将近一亩地。
    各部队生产，在集中统一领导下，采取集体分工经营方式。例如稻田农场的经营，即在统一领导下，把生产人员分成挖渠、耕地、育苗等几个专业队，各负专责，配合劳动，采取有计划有领导的集体分工，因而大大提高了劳动效率。
    最近个别农场发现虫害，有的稻田有遭水淹的危险。各单位已经注意防治。
    【又讯】人民解放军华北军区各部队包修的水利工程，已于六月下旬全部完成。各部在华北广大地区的永定河、海河、滦河、滹沱河、桑乾河、潮白河等二十多条河流上，完成了挖土、开渠、筑坝、修整等工程共一千一百余万土方。这对国家的水利和农业建设有相当大的帮助。如部队和民工一起完成的潮白河下游挖河工程，能使冀东八县人民免除连年水患的威胁。察南部队在桑乾河上修筑的三百华里长的大水渠，可使五十万亩旱地变成水田（今年可以灌溉十五万亩）。包修工程的解放军受到了当地政府和人民的热烈赞扬和慰劳。
    在动工以前，担任包修水利工程任务的各部都进行了半个月以上的生产教育。在集中统一的领导下，指战员们自觉地发挥了高度生产热忱和积极性，不断改进劳动组织和生产技术，克服了物质条件和经验缺乏的困难，因而使生产效率不断提高。在劳动中，各部普遍超过了原订每人每天出土一方半到三方的计划。某部战士刘金发竟创造了每日挖十七方土的最高纪录；某部二营始终保持了平均每天每人七点七方土的纪录。一般生产效率都超过民工百分之二十五到二百五十。因此，全军区各部所包工程，大部提前半月或二十天完成。工程的质量在严格督导检查下，一般都能达到工程要求标准。如河北军区修堤部队特别强调硪土工程要“砸结实，不图快”，作到层土层硪，一般的垫土一尺三，砸下四寸，符合河务局的要求标准。包修潮白河下游三十九万多方土堤工的某部，由于工程坚固，合乎标准，受到了该河工程处的奖励。
