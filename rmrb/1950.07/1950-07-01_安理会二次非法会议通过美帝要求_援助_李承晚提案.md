　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The United Nations Security Council held its second illegal meeting on the Korean issue on the afternoon of the 27th, and passed the US proposal requesting the Security Council to call on all UN member states to participate in armed intervention in the internal affairs of Korea. The Soviet delegation, as at the first meeting, did not attend. US Chief Representative Austin spoke at the meeting, reading out US President Truman's challenging statement, issued that morning, which undermined peace in the Far East, and announced that the United States was already giving "aid" to the Syngman Rhee group. He requested that the Security Council illegal meeting pass a resolution calling on UN member states to give "emergency aid" to the collapsing Syngman Rhee group.
　　The Yugoslav representative, in his subsequent speech, agreed to stop the just counter-offensive of the Korean people against the Syngman Rhee group, and put forward detailed amendments, essentially agreeing with the US intervention in Korean internal affairs, namely requiring "North Korea" to send a representative to the United Nations to accept "mediation."
　　The representatives of France, Britain, Cuba, and Norway all expressed their acceptance of the US opinion in their speeches. Chiang Ting-fu, the representative of the Kuomintang bandit gang, said that he was "very grateful to President Truman for announcing the decision to use the US fleet to block an attack on Taiwan." The representatives of India and Egypt claimed that they needed to consult with their respective governments before expressing their attitude, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned.
　　When the meeting continued on the evening of the 27th, Austin's reactionary proposal was illegally passed by a vote of seven to one, with the representatives of India and Egypt abstaining because they had not received notification from their respective governments.

　　安理会二次非法会议通过美帝要求“援助”李承晚提案
    【新华社三十日讯】联合国安全理事会于二十七日下午就朝鲜问题举行第二次非法会议，通过了美国要求安理会号召联合国各会员国参加武装干涉朝鲜内政的提案。苏联代表团和第一次会议举行时一样，没有出席。美国首席代表奥斯汀在会上发言时，宣读了美国总统杜鲁门于当天上午发表的破坏远东和平的挑战声明，并宣布美国已在给李承晚集团以“援助”。他要求安理会非法会议通过议案，号召联合国各会员国予正在溃败中的李承晚集团以“紧急的援助”。
    南斯拉夫代表在继起发言中，同意制止朝鲜人民对李承晚集团的正义的反攻，并提出实质上同意美国干涉朝鲜内政的细节上的修正，即要求“北朝鲜”派代表到联合国去接受“调解”。
    法国、英国、古巴、挪威的代表在发言中均表示接受美国的意见。国民党匪帮的代表蒋廷黻说，他“很感谢杜鲁门总统宣布决定用美国舰队来阻挡对台湾的进攻”。印度和埃及代表声称他们需要向本国政府商讨后才能表示态度，会议遂暂告休会。
    二十七日夜间会议继续时，以七票对一票非法地通过了奥斯汀的反动提案，印度、埃及两国代表因未接到本国政府之通知而弃权。
