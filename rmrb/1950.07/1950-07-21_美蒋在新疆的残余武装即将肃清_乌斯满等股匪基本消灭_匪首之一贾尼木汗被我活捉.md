Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 14th: The Headquarters of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently released a summary battle report on bandit suppression from March 5th to June 25th, stating that within three months and twenty days, the bandit suppression troops of the People's Liberation Army, with a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and tanks, and in coordination with military suppression and political efforts, have basically annihilated the bandit gangs of Uthman, Yaolebos, and Janim Khan. A total of 66 battles, large and small, were fought, resulting in the capture of 3,127 bandits, the killing or wounding of 1,023 bandits, and the surrender of 559 bandits. More than 16,000 people from over ten tribes, including Atongbaik, Aisan, and Halik, who were deceived and coerced by the bandits, have been won over and returned to the People's Government. Our army seized 52 light and heavy machine guns, 16 submachine guns, 1,126 rifles and carbines, 5 anti-tank rifles, 1 60mm mortar, 4 grenade launchers, over 11,000 rounds of ammunition, over 3,100 warhorses (including 500 killed or wounded), and other materials. The cattle, sheep, and camels looted by the bandits have been returned to their original owners. Currently, only about 200 remnant bandits remain from Uthman's and Janim Khan's gangs, and only about 50 remain from Yao's gang. Our bandit suppression troops are continuing to mop up the remaining bandits in order to thoroughly eliminate the bandit threat.

Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 15th: In the battle to pursue and annihilate the remnant bandits of Uthman in the Xiaohongliugou and Dabaiyanggou areas of Zhenxi County from June 30th to July 2nd, the bandit suppression troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army captured alive Janim Khan, a notorious special agent bandit leader who colluded with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In this battle, more than ten bandits were killed or wounded, and more than 500 Kazakh compatriots who had been coerced were liberated. Our army seized 3 machine guns, 22 rifles and carbines, 1 submachine gun, and other materials.

Uthman only led dozens of remnant bandits in a panic-stricken flight, abandoning almost all the cattle and sheep materials he had looted. Our army is continuing the pursuit.

Our army transferred the captured bandit Janim Khan to Hami on the 7th. People from all ethnic groups and all sectors of society in Zhenxi and Hami were overjoyed and gathered to celebrate. At the meetings, people from all ethnic groups and all sectors of society denounced Janim Khan's crimes of rape, plunder, and collusion with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and expressed their deep gratitude to the People's Liberation Army for eliminating harm for the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 16th: The Headquarters of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently sent a telegram to the various bandit suppression units of the military region, warmly congratulating the units on their glorious victory in basically eliminating local bandits after four months of operations. The congratulatory telegram pointed out that the bandit suppression troops, under extremely difficult conditions, bravely fought more than 60 battles, large and small, destroyed the lairs of the two bandits Uthman and Janim Khan, killed or captured more than 4,000 bandits, captured alive the bandit leader Janim Khan and bandit gang leader Han Jinlu, liberated more than 16,000 Kazakh compatriots, and carried out political efforts to disintegrate the remnant bandits, who surrendered and laid down their arms one after another. Hana Tibai, the chief of staff of the bandit forces, and Lao Erban, the leader of the regiment, both led their troops to surrender. The congratulatory telegram pointed out that our army's basic elimination of the remnant armed forces of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, Uthman, Janim Khan, and Yaolebos, has stabilized local order, protected the lives and property of the people, consolidated the victory of peaceful liberation, and enabled the people of Yiwu, Zhenxi, Muleihe, Qitai, and other counties to live and work in peace and contentment. The congratulatory telegram called on the entire army to continue its efforts to complete the task of guarding and suppressing bandits, and to completely, cleanly, and thoroughly annihilate the scattered remnant bandits, and to capture alive the bandit leaders Uthman and Yaolebos. In suppressing the remnant bandits, it is necessary to strictly implement policies and discipline, unite the broad masses of the people, carry out local work, and leave the remnant bandits with no place to hide, and to strive for the great task of consolidating the victory of bandit suppression, ensuring social security, stabilizing social order, and developing production and construction.
