Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th - Correspondents from French L'Humanité, British Daily Worker, and Beijing People's Daily have jointly issued a statement strongly protesting the crimes of American aircraft indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean residents. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　I. We, the undersigned correspondents from French L'Humanité, British Daily Worker, and Chinese People's Daily, most strongly protest the indiscriminate bombing by Americans in Korea.

　　II. We came to Korea to investigate and report the truth of the war that broke out on June 25th of this year.

　　III. One of our duties, like that of all journalists fighting for peace and freedom, is to determine the nature of the bombings in North and South Korea. As a result of our own investigation, we can confirm that the American bombing, accompanied by intense strafing with machine guns and rocket launchers, is a completely terroristic air raid.

　　IV. On July 20th, we were in Wonsan, a port and resort on the east coast of Korea. Since July 2nd, this city has been bombed seven times, with 1,088 houses and public buildings destroyed.

　　V. On July 6th, three workers' residential areas in the suburbs were bombed. On July 13th, a terrible bombing damaged seventeen districts and destroyed the Red Cross Hospital, the Municipal Hospital, a sanatorium (where 170 patients were tragically killed), several schools, etc.

　　VI. We witnessed the ruined walls and rubble of this massacred city. Up to now, 1,249 people have died there, one-third of whom were children and 45 percent were women.

　　VII. Witnessing the suffering of the victims and the barbarity of the attacks, we feel deeply indignant.

　　VIII. On July 21st, we returned from Wonsan to the capital, Pyongyang, which has also been bombed. American planes were at an altitude of about 3,000 meters, high in the clouds. Thus, it is naturally impossible to see any target. This air raid was deliberately intended to massacre peaceful people. We did not see whether the bombs bore the insignia of the United Nations, but we saw the ruins and victims of American aggression, and we strongly and angrily protest.

　　IX. We have given this statement to the Pyongyang branch of the New China News Agency, requesting that it be forwarded to all democratic newspapers in order to more forcefully condemn the appalling crimes of the Americans.

　　X. We appeal to all honest men and women around the world to intensify their struggle to stop the American imperialist aggression against the Korean people, to stop warships from sailing to Korean waters, and to stop the massacre of the venerable Korean women and children who are sacrificing everything to defend their right to a free life.

　　XI. We call on all true democrats in the United States to rise up and stop sending reinforcements to Korea, and demand the recall of the aggressor troops who are waging the most horrific war against the young People's Republic of Korea.

　　法国人道报、英国工人日报和本报记者
    联名抗议美机滥炸朝鲜
    呼吁全世界人民起来制止美国侵略
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】法国人道报、英国工人日报与北京人民日报的记者三人，顷发表联合声明，强烈抗议美国飞机滥炸朝鲜和平居民的罪行。声明全文如下：
    一、我们在下面署名的法国人道报、英国工人日报和中国人民日报的记者，最强有力地抗议美国人在朝鲜的滥肆轰炸。
    二、我们是来朝鲜考察并报道在本年六月二十五日爆发的战争的真相的。
    三、我们的职责之一，正如所有为和平与自由而斗争的新闻工作者的职责一样，是确定在北朝鲜和南朝鲜的轰炸的性质。由于我们亲身调查的结果，我们可以确定：美国这种伴以机关枪与火箭炮猛烈扫射的轰炸，完全是恐怖的空袭。
    四、七月二十日我们在元山，朝鲜东海岸的港口和胜地。自从七月二日以来，这个城市已被炸七次，被毁房舍与公共建筑达一千零八十八所。
    五、在七月六日，城郊三个工人住宅区被炸毁了。七月十三日，可怖的大轰炸损毁了十七个区，并炸毁了红十字医院、市立医院、一所疗养院（内一百七十个病人惨遭炸死）、好几所学校等等。
    六、我们目睹了这个被屠杀的城市的断墙颓瓦，一直到现在，那儿已有一千二百四十九个人死去；其中三分之一是儿童，百分之四十五是妇女。
    七、目睹受难者的惨痛与进袭的野蛮景象，我们深感愤怒。
    八、我们二十一日由元山返回首都平壤，当地也遭受了轰炸。美机在约三千公尺云层高空。这样，自然是不可能看见任何目标。这次空袭，是故意要残杀和平人民的。我们没有看出炸弹上是不是带有联合国的标志，可是我们看见了美国侵略摧残下的废墟和牺牲者，我们强烈地、忿怒地抗议。
    九、我们已将这一项声明交给新华社平壤分社，请该社转发给各民主报纸，以求更有力地斥责美国人的骇人听闻的罪行。
    十、我们向全世界正直的男女呼吁，要求他们加强斗争，制止美国对朝鲜人民的帝国主义侵略，阻止把战舰驶来朝鲜水面，制止对可敬的、正在牺牲一切保卫自由生活权利的朝鲜人民妇女儿童的屠杀。
    十一、我们呼吁美国国内一切真正的民主人士，起来制止向朝鲜派遣援军，要求召回正对年青的朝鲜人民共和国进行最恐怖的战争的侵略军。
    签名：马尼安（人道报）、魏宁敦（工人日报）、李庄（人民日报）。
