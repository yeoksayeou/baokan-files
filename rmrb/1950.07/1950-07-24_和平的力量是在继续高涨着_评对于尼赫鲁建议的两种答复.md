　　The Power of Peace is Continuing to Rise
    ——A Commentary on the Two Responses to Nehru’s Proposal

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru telegraphed Stalin on July 13th, proposing that the Soviet Union assist in a swift and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The method was to eliminate the current deadlock in the United Nations Security Council, so that representatives of the People's Republic of China could attend the Security Council, the Soviet Union could return to the Security Council, and with the assistance and cooperation of other peace-loving countries, seek a basis for ending the conflict and for the final resolution of the Korean issue. Stalin sent a reply telegram on July 15th, welcoming and fully agreeing with Nehru's peaceful initiative, and adding the suggestion that the Security Council should hear the views of representatives of the Korean people. Nehru and Stalin's wise suggestions in their correspondence on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue immediately won the unanimous support and praise of all peace-loving and just people in the world (including the Korean people). This demonstrates the desire of the vast majority of the world's people for peace and their unparalleled hatred of imperialist aggressive war.

    In stark contrast to Stalin's response to Nehru's proposal, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's reply to Nehru on July 19th brazenly rejected Nehru's peace appeal. On the same day, U.S. President Truman's message to Congress and his broadcast speech further demonstrated the U.S. government's determination to persist in the war of aggression.

    Truman and Acheson both described the U.S. attack on Korea as "fulfilling United Nations obligations" and "fighting for the United Nations." However, the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates the principle of unanimous agreement among the five permanent members for resolving international disputes. In order to facilitate its evil attempt to launch aggressive wars unscrupulously, U.S. imperialism deliberately sabotaged the United Nations Charter, refused to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations, and thereby forced representatives of the socialist Soviet Union and the new democracies to withdraw from the various forums of the United Nations. This created a situation in which U.S. imperialists illegally occupied the United Nations, especially the Security Council. This has turned the United Nations into a tool manipulated by U.S. aggressors, completely unable to carry out its normal work. Today, everything that U.S. imperialists are doing is a reversal of history that desecrates the United Nations Charter. Can this be denied by sophistry?

    Truman and Acheson falsely accused "North Korean aggression" of "threatening peace and security." But who would believe that the Korean people would "invade" themselves? And who would believe that the U.S. imperialist army, navy, and air force, traveling across oceans to attack Korea, are doing so to ensure "peace and security" rather than engaging in aggression? If the United States, in accordance with Articles 5 and 7 of the United Nations Charter, did not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and immediately withdrew U.S. troops from Korea, then "peace and security" would immediately cease to be "threatened," isn't that extremely obvious?

    In his reply to Nehru, Acheson sophistically claimed that the resolution of the Korean issue should not "be linked to the resolution of other issues currently before the United Nations"; therefore, he refused to "subject the United Nations to coercion and oppression." However, the people of the world can see clearly that it is the U.S. imperialists who have not only coerced and oppressed the United Nations, but have also committed the most brutal rape, to the extent that the United Nations has completely lost its purity. The United Nations and its Security Council, without the participation of two of the five major powers, namely the Soviet Union and China, can never be the United Nations and the Security Council. Therefore, to resolve the Korean issue through the normal activities of the United Nations and the Security Council, Nehru's proposed method is logically inevitable. The Chinese people fully support Nehru's proposal and Stalin's reply, believing that only by having representatives of the People's Republic of China quickly replace the position of that "government" without people or land, whose "status" in Taiwan has already been cancelled by the U.S. government, thereby allowing the Soviet Union to return to the Security Council and restoring the Security Council to life, can the Security Council have the legal possibility of resolving the Korean issue. Refusing this common-sense proposal is deliberately making trouble and deliberately creating and exploiting the deadlock in the Security Council to realize imperialist aggression.

    Although Nehru's proposal has not yet taken legal effect, it has already made a significant contribution to world politics. Stalin's reply and Acheson's reply pointed out to all mankind two diametrically opposed paths: the path of peace and the path of imperialist aggressive war. Indian public opinion correctly explained this distinction. The Indian News Chronicle, in its editorial on the 20th, pointed out that Acheson's note to Nehru "shattered the hope of an early return to peace" and condemned Acheson's "mad worship of power, which so far has only been combined with totalitarian rule." News reports indicate that Indian members of Parliament, socialists, members of the Mahasabha, Sikhs, and members of other parties "are all condemning Washington's narrow-mindedness and praising Marshal Stalin's drastically different attitude towards Nehru's appeal." This kind of Indian public opinion is by no means unique to India; it represents the common reaction of many countries that are actually unwilling to participate in the war of aggression. British Labor MP Davies said that Stalin's reply was "a breath of fresh air, breaking through the murky fog that obscures reasonable measures to resolve the Korean issue. No government can find the slightest reason to reject this brilliant opportunity offered by Stalin." The U.S. Compass Daily wrote irrefutably: "If we rebuke India, we are insisting on war." Precisely because of this, even newspapers like the Philippine Daily Mirror and the Philippine Herald expressed sympathy for the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Daily Mirror pointed out that "South Korea's weakness lies in the fact that its government is not supported by the people," while the Philippine Herald, after citing reports that the war was provoked by Syngman Rhee, said: "The politicians and leaders of a country should be a little slower in making quick decisions or reckless interpretations regarding foreign policy." From this, it can be seen that the truth cannot be concealed, and the power of the call for peace and justice cannot be stopped.

    No matter how arrogant U.S. imperialism appears on the surface, no matter how united the United States and its collaborators appear on the surface, the facts have already shown that the power of peace is continuing to rise. On the one hand, the people of the world welcome Stalin's reply to Nehru and oppose Acheson's reply; on the other hand, even the governments of the vast majority of countries that accepted the Security Council's illegal intervention in Korea refused to send ground troops to Korea to participate in the war. These are two fundamentally important facts, and these two facts once again tell all those in the world who stand on the side of peace: the power of the peace camp is greater than the power of the aggressive camp; the aggressors can be completely defeated, and peace can be completely saved. People who uphold peace and justice, continue to strive and struggle!

### 和平的力量是在继续高涨着——评对于尼赫鲁建议的两种答复

　　和平的力量是在继续高涨着
    ——评对于尼赫鲁建议的两种答复
    印度共和国总理尼赫鲁七月十三日致电斯大林，建议苏联协助迅速和平解决朝鲜问题。其办法是消除联合国安理会中目前的僵局，以便使中华人民共和国政府的代表出席安理会，使苏联回到安理会，在其他爱好和平国家协助与合作下，为停止冲突，并为朝鲜问题的最后解决寻求基础。斯大林于七月十五日发出复电，欢迎并且完全赞同尼赫鲁的和平创议，并补充建议在安理会上应听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见。尼赫鲁和斯大林来往电文中关于和平解决朝鲜问题的明智的建议，立即获得了全世界爱好和平正义的人类（包括朝鲜人民在内）一致的拥护赞扬。这表示了世界最大多数人民渴求和平的愿望和对帝国主义侵略战争无比的憎恨。
    和斯大林对于尼赫鲁建议的答复极端相反，美国国务卿艾奇逊七月十九日给尼赫鲁的答复却悍然拒绝了尼赫鲁的和平呼吁。同日，美国总统杜鲁门向国会提出的咨文及其广播演说，更表明了美国政府坚持侵略战争的决心。
    杜鲁门和艾奇逊都把美国对朝鲜的进攻说成是“履行联合国的义务”，是“为联合国作战”。但是，联合国宪章明白规定五强一致协议解决国际纠纷的原则。美帝国主义者为了便于实现它肆无忌惮地发动侵略战争的罪恶企图，蓄意破坏联合国的宪章，拒绝中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国，借此迫使维护正义的社会主义苏联和新民主主义各国的代表退出联合国的各个会场。这样就造成了美帝国主义者非法霸占联合国特别是霸占安理会的局面。这就使联合国变成了美国侵略者一手把持的工具，完全不能进行它的正常工作。今天美帝国主义者的所作所为，无一不是亵渎联合国宪章的倒行逆施。这难道是狡辩所能抵赖的吗？
    杜鲁门和艾奇逊诬告“北朝鲜侵略”使“和平安全感受威胁”。但是有谁会相信朝鲜人民自己会“侵略”自己呢？又有谁会相信美帝国主义的陆海空军，远涉重洋进攻朝鲜，反而是为了保障“和平与安全”而不是侵略呢？如果美国按照联合国宪章第五条和第七条的规定，不干涉他国内政，立即把美军撤出朝鲜，那末，“和平与安全”就立即不会再“感受威胁”，这不是极明显的吗？
    艾奇逊在他给尼赫鲁的复函中，诡称朝鲜问题的解决，不能“与现在联合国面前的其他问题的解决有任何关连”；因而他拒绝“使联合国遭受强制及压迫的行为”。然而，全世界人民都看得清楚，正是美帝国主义者对联合国不但实行了强制与压迫，而且实行了最凶暴的强奸，以致于联合国完全丧失了她的纯洁。没有五强中的两强即苏联和中国参加的联合国及其安理会，决不能成为联合国和安理会。因此，要经由联合国和安理会的正常活动来解决朝鲜问题，尼赫鲁建议的办法就是逻辑上所不可避免的。中国人民完全赞成尼赫鲁的建议和斯大林的答复，认为只有使中华人民共和国的代表在联合国中迅速代替那个连在台湾的“地位”也已经被美国政府所勾销了的无人民无土地的“政府”的位置，从而使苏联回到安理会，使安理会恢复生命，才使安理会有合法解决朝鲜问题的可能，而拒绝这种常识的建议，就是故意无理取闹，就是故意要制造和利用安理会的僵局来实现帝国主义的侵略。
    尼赫鲁的建议虽然还没有在法律上生效，但是它已经为世界政治作了有巨大意义的贡献。斯大林的答复和艾奇逊的答复向全人类明显不过地指出了两条相反的道路：和平的道路和帝国主义侵略战争的道路。印度的舆论正确地说明了这个区别。印度新闻纪事报在二十日的社论指出艾奇逊致尼赫鲁的照会“打破了早日恢复和平的希望”，并且谴责艾奇逊“疯狂地崇拜强权主义，而这种强权主义迄今为止都只有与极权统治才能结合在一起”。消息说印度的国会人士，社会党人、大乘会会员、锡克教徒和其他党派人士“都在谴责华盛顿的狭小眼光，而盛赞斯大林大元帅对尼赫鲁的呼吁所采取的截然不同的态度”。印度的这种舆论决不是印度一国的，它代表着许多实际上不愿意参加侵略战争的国家的共同反应。英国的工党议员戴维斯说斯大林的复电是“一股光辉的清新空气，冲破了掩蔽着解决朝鲜问题的合理措施的污浊迷雾。没有一个政府能找出最细微的理由足以拒绝斯大林提供的这个光辉的机会”。美国的指南针日报无可辩驳地写道：“如果我们斥责印度，我们就是坚持战争。”正是因为这样，就连菲律宾的每日镜报和菲律宾先驱报这样的报纸，也对和平解决朝鲜的建议表示同情。每日镜报指出“南朝鲜的弱点在于它的政府不为人民所支持”，而菲律宾先驱报则在引证了战争是由李承晚所挑起的报道以后说：“一国的政治家和首脑们对于外交政策应该稍慢一些才作迅速的决定或鲁莽的解释。”由此可见，事实的真相是不能隐瞒的，和平的正义呼吁的力量，是不能阻止的。
    无论美国帝国主义表面上怎样蛮横，无论美国和它的合作者表面上怎样一致，但是事实已经表明了：和平的力量正在继续高涨着。在一方面，世界各国人民欢迎斯大林对尼赫鲁的答复而反对艾奇逊的答复，在另一方面，甚至接受安理会非法干涉朝鲜决议的绝大多数国家的政府，也拒绝派遣地面部队到朝鲜去参战。这是两个有基本重要性的事实，这两个事实再一次告诉全世界一切站在和平方面的人们：和平阵营的力量大于侵略阵营的力量；侵略者是完全可以击退的，和平是完全可以挽救的。拥护和平与正义的人们，继续努力奋斗啊！
