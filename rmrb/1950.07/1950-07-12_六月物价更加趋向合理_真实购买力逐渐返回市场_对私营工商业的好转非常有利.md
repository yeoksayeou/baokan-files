Xinhua News Agency, 10th: National prices continued to remain stable in June, and market transactions became more active and normal. In early June, the average wholesale price of 25 major commodities, including grain, decreased by 0.4 percent compared to late May. In mid-June, it rose by 3.1 percent compared to early June, and in late June, it rose again by 2.3 percent compared to mid-June. The price fluctuations throughout the month were small, generally maintaining a slightly rising trend. By commodity type: Grain prices fell by 2.8 percent in early June (compared to the average wholesale price of the previous ten days, the same below); rose by 3 percent in mid-June; and rose by 0.4 percent in late June (the Southwest region saw a larger increase in mid and late June, while other regions saw a decrease). Cotton yarn and cloth prices rose by 2.2 percent in early June, 0.8 percent in mid-June, and 2.1 percent in late June. Staple and non-staple foods such as salt fell by 6.8 percent in early June, rose by 2.7 percent in mid-June, and rose again by 3.3 percent in late June. Fuel prices rose by 0.5 percent in early June, 0.7 percent in mid-June, and 1.7 percent in late June. Sundry goods rose by 2.8 percent in early June, 5.7 percent in mid-June, and again by 3.8 percent in late June. The decline in grain and non-staple food prices was due to the new wheat entering the market and the salt tax reduction. Sundry goods rose the most because imported raw materials such as vulcanized green and rubber had fallen too much in the past and had become disconnected from the foreign market. Market transactions were normal in June, and prices rose due to the impact of rising foreign market prices. The slight increase in yarn and cloth prices was because yarn prices in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places were too low in the past, and the yarn-cloth exchange ratio was unreasonable. In June, state-owned trading companies took the initiative to raise the listed price of yarn. Therefore, from the perspective of the price trends of various major goods in June, not only were the increases and decreases not large, but they were also in line with normal general market laws.

The main characteristic of the uniform price performance across the country in June was that it increasingly tended towards reasonableness. This was the result of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government beginning to rationally adjust prices nationwide from mid-June. In terms of the difference between retail and wholesale prices, a reasonable difference of 5 to 10 percent has generally been maintained. In terms of the difference between production and sales areas, the phenomenon of price inversions has been reversed. Taking alkali noodles as an example: on May 10, the market price in the production area of Tianjin was 6.6 percent higher than that in Beijing, and even 23 percent higher than the market prices in Shijiazhuang and Xi'an. However, by June 30, the market price in Beijing was 3.1 percent higher than that in Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang was 14.3 percent higher than Tianjin. Due to stable prices, the situation in which state-owned trading companies maintained listed prices higher than market prices in order to take care of private enterprises during the past period of falling prices was changed in June.

Because of the continued stability of prices and the rational adjustments of state-owned trading organizations, coupled with the new wheat entering the market and the increasingly smooth flow of exchanges between urban and rural areas, market transactions have become more active. According to statistics: in the grain market, the transaction volume of flour in Beijing and Tianjin was more than 12,400 bags in early June, more than 16,900 bags in mid-June, and more than 18,000 bags in late June; while only more than 13,500 bags were traded in late May. The transaction volume of rice in Shanghai was more than 4.64 million jin in early June, more than 11.75 million jin in mid-June, and more than 13.23 million jin in late June; only more than 5.65 million jin were traded in late May. The total transaction volume of white fine cloth in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai was 23,027 bolts in mid-June and 32,692 bolts in late June. It can be seen from this that real purchasing power has gradually returned to the market, and because of the wheat harvest, purchasing power is increasing, which is very beneficial to the improvement of the business conditions of private industry and commerce.

　　六月物价更加趋向合理
    真实购买力逐渐返回市场
    对私营工商业的好转非常有利
    【新华社十日讯】六月份全国物价继续保持平稳，市场交易愈趋活跃和正常。六月上旬全国粮食等二十五种主要商品的平均批发价，比五月下旬降低百分之零点四，六月中旬比上旬回升百分之三点一，六月下旬又比中旬上升百分之二点三。全月间物价升降幅度很小，一般保持微升的趋势。以商品种类分：粮食类上旬落百分之二点八（与前十天的平均批发价相比，以下同）；中旬回升百分之三，下旬上升百分之零点四（中下旬西南区上涨较多，其他地区均下降）。花纱布类上旬升百分之二点二，中旬升百分之零点八，下旬升百分之二点一。食盐等副食类上旬落百分之六点八，中旬升百分之二点七，下旬又升百分之三点三。燃料类上旬升百分之零点五，中旬升百分之零点七，下旬上升百分之一点七。杂货类上旬升百分之二点八，中旬升百分之五点七，下旬又升百分之三点八。粮食与副食品价格的下降，是由于新麦上市与食盐减税的结果。杂货类上升最多，原因是硫化青、橡胶等进口原料过去落价太多，已与国外市场脱节。六月份市场交易正常，同时受国外市价上升影响，因而上涨。纱布类微升的原因是过去津沪等地纱价太低，纱布交换比率不合理，六月中国营贸易公司主动提高了纱的牌价。因此从六月份各种主要货物价格的动向来看，不仅升降幅度不大，而且是合乎正常一般市场规律的。
    六月份全国各种物价一致表现的主要特点，是愈加趋向合理。这是中央人民政府贸易部自六月中旬起在全国范围内开始合理调整价格的结果。以零售价和批发价差额来说，一般已保持了百分之五到百分之十的合理差额。以产销地区差额来说，倒挂的现象已扭转过来。以碱面为例：五月十日产地天津的市价高出北京百分之六点六，甚至高出石家庄、西安两地市价的百分之二十三。但至六月三十日，北京市价已高于天津百分之三点一，石家庄已比天津高出百分之十四点三。由于物价平稳，在过去物价下落期间国营贸易公司为照顾私营企业而维持牌价高于市价的情况，已在六月份加以改变。
    因为物价的继续平稳与国营贸易机关的合理调整，加以新麦上市、城乡交流日渐畅旺，市场交易已愈加活跃。据统计：粮食市场京、津两地面粉成交量上旬为一万二千四百余袋，中旬为一万六千九百余袋，下旬为一万八千余袋；而五月下旬仅成交一万三千五百多袋。上海市大米成交量上旬为四百六十四万余斤，中旬为一千一百七十五万余斤，下旬为一千三百二十三万余斤；五月下旬仅成交五百六十五万多斤。白细布市场京、津、沪三地总成交量中旬为二万三千零二十七匹，下旬为三万二千六百九十二匹。由此可见真实购买力已逐渐返回市场，并且由于小麦上市，购买力正在增涨，这对于私营工商业经营状况的好转是非常有利的。
