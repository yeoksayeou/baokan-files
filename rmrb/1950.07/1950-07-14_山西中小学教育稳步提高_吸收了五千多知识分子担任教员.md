　　Shanxi's Primary and Secondary Education Steadily Improves
	More Than 5,000 Intellectuals Recruited as Teachers
	[This newspaper dispatch] Shanxi Province's primary and secondary education has improved in terms of enrollment and teaching quality in the past six months, based on the principle of consolidation and improvement. At the same time, a large number of intellectuals have been united and transformed to serve the people's education cause.

	The province currently has 70 secondary schools, including 36 provincial schools, 31 county (or joint) schools, and 3 private schools. During the winter vacation last year, the Department of Culture and Education merged and added some schools according to the actual situation in various places. This year, the number of provincial secondary schools has decreased by two compared to last year, but the number of classes has increased by 13, and the number of students has increased by 969. The number of county middle schools has decreased by one compared to last year, and the number of county normal schools has decreased by three, while the number of joint secondary schools has increased by seven. The teaching quality of all schools has improved. The past tendency of old liberated area schools to neglect classroom teaching and the purely cultural viewpoints of new liberated area schools have been overcome or are being overcome. General schools have begun to pay attention to organizing teaching groups, strengthening teacher learning, and raising the improvement of teaching work to a primary position.

	According to statistics from November last year, there are a total of 18,868 primary schools in the province, with 900,559 students, accounting for approximately 51% of school-age children. In this period, primary education has developed steadily in areas with suitable conditions. Taiyuan City has developed relatively quickly, with an increase of more than 4,900 students. Xin County, Fenyang, Linfen, Changzhi, and other special districts have also seen an increase in students. It is planned that the average number of children enrolled this year can increase by 10% compared to last year. All localities have achieved results in improving educational leadership institutions, implementing educational policies, and solving problems such as teachers and funding. In particular, primary school teachers have a high enthusiasm for learning in the past six months. They have generally organized teaching research groups and observed, demonstrated, and exchanged experiences with each other to improve teaching. In terms of teaching work, attention has begun to be paid to the overall responsibility for children.

	The problems in education work are, first of all, the low quality and insufficient quantity of teachers. In the past year, the province has distributed 5,391 students from Shanxi Public School and the former North China University, as well as absorbing unemployed intellectuals to participate in education work. When organizing teachers to study during winter and summer vacations, various special and county governments have also absorbed some intellectuals in the countryside to participate and serve as teachers after learning. However, some areas still feel that there are not enough teachers. The quality of primary and secondary school teachers in the province is generally very low. Among primary school teachers, those with higher or junior primary school qualifications account for more than half; those with less than three years of service account for 52%. According to a survey of 320 teachers in Fenyang County, two-thirds are unable to manage children or use new teaching methods; one-third have insufficient or even misunderstood the educational policy; and one-third want to change careers and lack professional ideas. Therefore, cultivating and improving the quality of teachers is an extremely important issue at present.

	Secondly, the development of education in the province is uneven. For example, in the old liberated areas of Xiyang and Heshun, the enrollment rate of children is over 80%; while in Xing County, it is only 20.5%. The same is true in terms of teachers. For example, in Linfen, Yuncheng, Taiyuan, and other cities, there are more intellectuals, and in addition to meeting the current needs of teachers, there are still some unemployed; while in the two special districts of Changzhi and Xing County, even if the standards for teachers are relaxed and the requirements are lowered, they are often unable to fill the positions.

	The educational administrative leadership is also unsound. Many counties still lack education section chiefs, and there are even more vacancies for section members and supervisors. In addition, the cultural and professional level of cadres is low, so that the current educational administrative leadership is mostly limited to the handling of daily routine work, and the leadership of teaching work is very poor.

	In addition, more than half of the rural schools lack fixed school buildings. In the past year, teachers and students in various places have built many school buildings and equipment with the help of the masses under the call of labor to build schools. This issue still needs to be vigorously resolved in the future.

　　山西中小学教育稳步提高
    吸收了五千多知识分子担任教员
    【本报讯】山西省的中小学教育，半年来根据巩固与提高的方针，入学人数和教学质量均有提高，同时团结改造了大批知识分子为人民的教育事业服务。
    全省现有中等学校七十所，其中省立的三十六所，县立（或联立）的三十一所，私立的三所。去年寒假中，文教厅根据各地实际情况合并和增设了一部分学校，本年省立中等学校比去年减少了两所，但比去年增加了十三个班，增加了学生九百六十九人。县立中学比去年减少了一校，县立师范减少了三校，而联立中等学校则增加了七校。各校教学质量都有提高，过去老区学校轻视课堂教学和新区学校单纯的文化观点都已经克服或正在克服。一般学校已开始注意组织教学小组，加强教师学习，把改进教学工作提高到了首要地位。
    全省的小学，据去年十一月统计，共有一万八千八百六十八座，学生九十万零五百五十九人，约占学龄儿童的百分之五十一。本期在有条件的地区小学教育已有稳步的发展。其中以太原市发展较快，增加了学生四千九百余名。忻县、汾阳、临汾、长治等专区学生亦有增加。计划今年入学儿童平均可以比去年增加百分之十。各地在健全教育领导机构、贯彻教育方针以及解决师资、经费等问题上都有成绩。特别是半年来小学教师的学习情绪很高，普遍组织了教学研究小组并互相观摩、示范、交流经验，以改进教学。在教导工作方面，已开始注意对儿童的全面负责。
    教育工作中的问题，首先是教师质量低，数量不足。一年来该省由山西公学、前华北大学分发的学员以及吸收失业的知识分子参加教育工作者，共达五千三百九十一人。各专、县在寒暑假组织教员学习时，都吸收了一部分在乡知识分子参加，学习后担任教师。但有的地区现在还感到教员不够。全省中小学教师的质量一般都很低，小学教师中只有高、初小程度的占一半以上；服务三年以下的占百分之五十二。据汾阳县在三百二十名教员中调查，管理不了儿童与不会运用新的教学法的占三分之二；对教育方针领会不够甚至有误解的占三分之一；而且三分之一想转业，缺乏专业思想。因此培养与提高师资是目前极其重要的问题。
    其次，全省教育发展不平衡，如老区昔阳、和顺，入学儿童达百分之八十以上；而兴县只有百分之二十点五。在师资方面也是如此，如临汾、运城、太原等市知识分子较多，除满足现在师资外，尚有部分失业的；而长治、兴县两专区，即使放宽教师尺度，降低要求，也经常不能满员。
    教育行政领导也不健全，有许多县还缺教育科长，科员、督学缺额更多，再加以干部的文化、业务水平低，以致目前教育行政领导大多限于日常事务工作的处理，对教学工作的领导很差。
    此外，农村学校还有半数以上缺乏固定的校舍。一年来各地师生在劳动建校的号召下，依靠群众修建了许多校舍和用具，今后仍要大力去解决这一问题。
