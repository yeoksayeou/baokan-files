　　Northeast China, a certain regiment neglects cultural learning during production.
    Improvement measures have been developed after self-criticism
    [Our Newspaper] A certain regiment in the Northeast Military Region reviewed the shortcomings of neglecting cultural learning by leaders during production and discussed future improvement measures. From the beginning of agricultural production in early April to mid-May, the cultural education in this regiment experienced a serious state of drifting aimlessly. When the troops began production, the leadership only required them to focus on self-study practice, learning two characters a day, but without formulating specific plans and learning methods, lacking concrete leadership and inspection supervision, and without clearly stipulating study time. Moreover, cultural teachers were used as laborers to engage in production work. In terms of leadership thinking, there was insufficient understanding of cultural education. No meetings were specifically convened to study learning methods based on the specific circumstances of production. For example, how should cultural teachers go to teach separately when the company's residence is dispersed? How should the groups use and seize the time for self-study? These issues were not promptly studied and resolved. The idea of some soldiers that "everything is for production, culture can be ignored" was also not corrected in time. As a result, cultural education did not proceed normally. For example, in Group A of the first company, some platoons only learned three lessons of the Chinese language course, while the machine gun platoon learned eight lessons. Before going to the fields, all groups in the regiment had learned thirty-seven lessons of the Chinese language course. After going to the fields, the second company only had five lessons, and the fourth company had nineteen lessons, a difference of fourteen lessons. Some units had a disconnect between teaching and self-study. For example, the guard company's Group C Chinese language course was taught to forty-two lessons, and the soldiers had already self-studied to fifty lessons; the production team was taught to forty-eight lessons, and the soldiers self-studied to sixty lessons. Some soldiers, in order to learn new characters, found the peasants' "Farming Classics" to read.
    After reviewing the above situation, the regiment's leadership convened a meeting of cultural teachers to specifically discuss future improvement measures: it was stipulated that one hour of cultural class should be held every morning from 4:30 to 5:30, and the remaining time should be used for review and self-study. Cultural teachers should go to the regimental headquarters every two weeks to hold meetings to arrange cultural education and study teaching methods. At the same time, a number of cadres and soldiers with a high level of education were hired to serve as teachers in various groups. For companies where the platoons are scattered and there are only two cultural teachers, the cultural teachers can lead two separately residing platoons separately. For platoons residing in the same village as the company headquarters, the political instructor and clerk will lead them. In terms of division of labor, it was determined that cultural teachers would be responsible for the teaching of Groups C and B, and another person from Group A would be hired to teach Group D; during rest, Group C would help Group D with tutoring (because Group C had already learned the courses of Group D). Cultural teachers should use rest time during morning field work to make up for teaching; in the afternoon, they will provide tutoring to those plowing, feeding horses, and cooking.
    At the same time, attention should be paid to promoting good learning methods, and commanders and fighters should be mobilized to sign mutual aid teaching contracts. The term of the contract should be one month, and an inspection should be conducted every month. Those who teach well and learn well should be commended by the leadership. Each company can also establish "writing bags" and place them in places where soldiers often pass by. Soldiers write things and put them in. The cultural teacher checks, deletes, and revises sentences and typos every night. In addition, it is also advocated to bring books to the fields to study to supplement the lack of teaching time.

### 东北某团生产期间忽视文化学习  检讨后已订出改进办法

　　东北某团生产期间忽视文化学习
    检讨后已订出改进办法
    【本报讯】东北军区某团检讨在生产时期忽视领导文化学习的缺点，并研讨了今后改进办法。该团自四月初下地生产至五月中旬，文化教育曾发生严重的自流现象。部队开始进行生产时，领导上只是要求抓紧自学练习，每天认二个字，但未订出具体计划与学习方法，缺乏具体领导与检查督促，没有明确规定学习时间，而且把文化教员顶一个劳动力去搞生产工作。在领导思想上，对文化教育认识不够，没有根据生产的具体情况，召开会议专门研究学习方法。如连队驻地分散，文化教员应如何分头去教？各组又怎样运用和抓紧时间自学等问题，均未及时研究解决。对部分战士认为“一切为了生产，文化可以不学”的思想，也未及时纠正。结果文化教育进行不正常。如一连甲组的国文课，有的排只学到三课，而机筒排学到八课。全团的丙组国文课在下地前都学到三十七课，在下地生产后，二连只上了五课，四连上了十九课，相差达十四课之多。有的单位教学与自学脱节，如警卫连丙组国文讲到四十二课，战士已自学到了五十课；生产队讲到四十八课，战士自学到六十课。有的战士为了学生字，就找老乡的《庄稼经》来读。
    该团领导上检讨了上述情况后，并召开了文化教员会议，专门讨论了今后改进办法：规定每天早晨自四点半至五点半上一小时文化课，其余时间用以复习与自学。文化教员每两周到团部开会一次，布置文化教育，研究教学方法。同时聘请一部分文化程度高的干部、战士担任各组教员。各排驻地分散而只有两个文化教员的连队，可由文化教员分头领导两个单独住的排，和连部住在一个屯的排，则由政治指导员与文书领导。在分工上，确定文化教员担任丙组、乙组的教学，另从甲组聘请一人教丁组；休息时由丙组帮助丁组补习（因为丁组课程丙组都学过）。文化教员要有计划的在上午下地工作中，利用休息时间作补习教学；下午则给扶犁的、喂马的和炊事员进行补习。
    同时，注意推广好的学习方法，发动指战员订立互助教学合同，合同的期限以一个月为宜，每月检查一次，对教得好和学得好的同志，领导上应予以表扬。各连队并可建立“写话袋”，放在战士们时常经过的地方。战士们写了东西就放进去。每晚由文化教员检查，删改句子和错字。另外，还提倡带书本到地里去学习，以补助教学时间的不足。（《前进报》）
