　　Blindly Trusting Subordinate Reports and Failing to Conduct On-Site Inspections
    Yanggao County Party Committee Reviews False Reports
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Yanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Chahar Province, in its report on sowing and seed soaking published in May of this year, and in the work reports submitted to the Yanbei Special District Office, contained many exaggerated and untrue elements. The Yanggao County Committee has now conducted a review of this matter and made a profound self-criticism. The Yanggao County Committee's May 12th report on the soaking and mixing of seeds in the Third District stated: "Due to patient teaching and personal experimentation beforehand, the ideological concerns of the masses were overcome, every household mastered the technique, and 100% of the district's seeds were soaked"; the May 20th work report stated: "As of the 12th, all ninety-six villages in the Third and Ninth Districts have completed sowing in the fields, one hundred and four villages in the Fifth, Seventh, and Thirteenth Districts have reached 83%, and most other districts have completed 75%." After receiving the above-mentioned work report, the Yanbei Special District, in order to learn from experience, dispatched a work team to the Third District of Yanggao for on-site inspection on May 14th. The inspection results showed that the district's work did indeed have many achievements, but it also found that the Yanggao County Committee's report contained many inaccuracies. For example, seed soaking in the Third District was still experimental, and the masses had many concerns about it. Some villages had many households that did not soak their seeds at all. For example, in Wangguantun Village, thirty-six households did not soak their seeds. The time for completing sowing in each district also differed by half a month from the time written in the May 20th work report. The May 12th report stated: "All twenty villages, including Nanshaling, have completed sowing"; in reality, Nanshaling Village, which was relatively good in the entire county, only completed field sowing on May 20th. In its self-criticism, the Yanggao County Committee pointed out that the reason for these false reports was: Firstly, the bureaucratic work style of the county committee leadership. Although the May 12th report was based on information obtained by the county party secretary, Liu Zhengguo, at district and village cadre meetings, and after reviewing the materials, it was not analyzed, researched, or inspected on-site. The May 20th work report was written based on government statistics, and likewise, it was not considered or investigated, but blindly believed that the work had already been done well. Another reason for the error was the commandist work style of the county committee leadership. The county committee did not follow the mass line in its work, the tasks assigned were not specific, district cadres were weak in ability, village cadres were afraid of delaying work, and the work tasks were very heavy. In addition, some Party members had an incorrect view of awards in their work, resulting in a competitive spirit and a tendency to boast and exaggerate, so false achievements and fabricated figures were produced in the reports, or more achievements were reported and fewer shortcomings. After recognizing these errors, the county committee has proposed corrective measures: 1. Strengthen learning. 2. Convey and educate on the spirit of opposing false reports from the county to the district and village levels, face up to shortcomings, and correct mistakes. 3. In future work, the county committee has decided that, in addition to a few people grasping the center, most cadres will go deep into the villages and households to conduct on-site inspections. 4. Launch criticism and self-criticism. In order to educate everyone, the county committee has also requested that this issue be published publicly.

### 盲目相信下级报告，不做实地检查  阳高县委检讨假报告

　　盲目相信下级报告，不做实地检查
    阳高县委检讨假报告
    【本报讯】中共察哈尔省阳高县委在今年五月中发表的关于播种浸拌种的报道和向雁北专署所作的工作周报中，存在着很多夸大不实在的地方。现在阳高县委已对这件事进行了检查，并作了深刻的检讨。阳高县委五月十二日关于该县三区浸种拌种工作的报道中写道：“由于事先耐心传授亲自试验，克服了群众的思想顾虑，户户掌握了技术，全区浸种达到百分之百”；二十号的工作周报中写道：“自十二号统计，三、九区九十六个村全部完成播种大田，五、七、十三个区一百零四个村达百分之八十三，其他各区大部完成百分之七十五”。雁北专区接获上述周报后，为了吸取经验，就在五月十四日派了工作组到阳高三区进行实地检查。检查结果，发现该区工作确有不少成绩，但同时发现阳高县委的报告有很多与事实不符的地方。比如三区浸种还是实验性的，群众对此顾虑很多，有的村子很多户根本未浸种。如王官屯村就有三十六户没有浸种。各区完成播种时间也与五月二十日的周报中所写的时间前后相差半月。十二日的报道中说：“南沙岭等二十村全部完成播种”；实际上全县较好的南沙岭村，是在五月二十日才完成大田播种的。阳高县委在检讨中指出所以发生这些假报告的原因说：这首先是县委领导上的官僚主义作风。十二日的报道，虽然经过县委书记刘正国在区、村干部会上问了情况并看了材料，但是并未加以分析研究与实地检查。二十日的周报是根据政府的统计写的，同样未加考虑，未做调查，就盲目地认为工作都已经作好了。造成错误的另一个原因是县委领导上的命令主义作风。县委在工作中不走群众路线，任务交待不具体，区干部能力弱，村干部怕误工，而工作任务又十分繁重，加以某些党员错误地看待工作中的评奖，产生锦标主义和好大喜功的情绪，因而在汇报中就产生了假造成绩捏造数字，或者是多报成绩少报缺点的现象。县委认识了这些错误后已提出改正办法：一、加强学习。二、将反假报告的精神由县到区、村逐级进行贯彻教育，正视缺点，改正错误。三、县委在今后工作中，除少数人掌握中心外，决定将大部干部深入到村、户进行实地检查。四、展开批评与自我批评。为了教育大家，县委并请求将这一问题公开发表。
