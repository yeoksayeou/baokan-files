　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th -- The barbaric act of US imperialism's armed intervention in Korean internal affairs has aroused the anger of the Korean people. Patriotic youths in North Korea have been vying to join the army and go to the front lines to kill the enemy. Following Kim Il-sung University, male and female students from various universities, specialized schools, and high schools in North Korea, as well as the vast number of working youths in factories and rural areas, have successively held mobilization rallies. As of the end of June, more than 80,000 youths have submitted petitions to General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, requesting to join the army.
　　People from all walks of life in Korea continue to denounce the aggression of US imperialism. Kim Myung-gul, a worker at the Pyongyang Central Machinery Manufacturing Plant, said: The despicable attempt of US imperialism to carry out armed intervention is bound to fail. We must chop off the bloody hands of US imperialism that are stained with the blood of the Korean people. I have already completed the year's production plan ahead of schedule and with doubled output by the end of June. In order to fully and quickly supply the front lines, I will work even harder to produce. Farmer Lu Xianhuan said: The invaders will get nothing from us except the shameful defeat they got from the heroic Chinese people. Our sacred task as farmers is to ensure the supply of sufficient military rations and to do a good job of giving preferential treatment to military families. Kim Kwang-soon, a professor at Kim Il-sung University, said: The history of the Chinese revolution gloriously proves a truth: a just war against aggressors will surely be victorious.

　　朝鲜人民决心打败美军
    八万青年要求参军
    工农努力生产支援前线
    【新华社平壤四日电】美帝国主义武力干涉朝鲜内政的野蛮行为，已激起朝鲜人民的愤怒，北朝鲜的爱国青年已纷纷要求参军，前赴前线杀敌。继金日成大学之后，北朝鲜各大学、专门学校与高中的男女学生及工厂与农村的广大劳动青年，都先后召开了动员大会。截至六月底止，向朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军呈送请愿书要求参军的青年，已达八万余名。
    朝鲜各界人民继续怒斥美帝国主义的侵略。平壤中央机械制造所的工人金明杰说：美帝国主义进行武装干涉的卑鄙企图是一定要失败的。我们要斩断沾满了朝鲜人民鲜血的美帝国主义的魔手。我已在六月底提前并加倍完成了全年生产计划。为了充分而迅速地供应前线，我将更加努力生产。农民鲁先焕说：侵略者从我们这里除了像从英勇的中国人民那里所得到的可耻的失败之外，再不能得到别的东西。我们农民的神圣任务，是要保证供给充足的军粮并要作好优待军属的工作。金日成大学教授金光淳说：中国革命的历史显赫地证明了一个真理：反对侵略者的正义战争，一定胜利。
