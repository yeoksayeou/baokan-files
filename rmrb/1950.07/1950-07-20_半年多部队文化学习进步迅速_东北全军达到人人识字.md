　　Rapid Progress in Cultural Learning in the Troops Over the Past Six Months; Literacy Achieved by All in the Northeast Military Region
    [Shenyang Dispatch] Since last winter, the troops of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have launched a large-scale cultural learning movement in conjunction with military training and production. Now, there are no illiterate officers or soldiers in the entire army, and half of the personnel have reached a level of literacy of 500 characters or more. In the course of learning, each company has divided into classes according to the educational level of the soldiers, with the company's cultural instructors teaching the courses; and mutual assistance and mutual teaching have been promoted. All departments have established formal courses, regular tests, promotion and demotion systems. A certain division stationed in Andong has also established cultural bonuses to reward units and individuals with outstanding cultural learning achievements. Based on a high degree of political awareness, all officers and soldiers consciously regard cultural learning as a political task and work tirelessly. Every day, in addition to drills, officers and soldiers read and write together anytime and anywhere, and have developed a habit of learning. Cooks practice writing while tending the fire, and feeders read textbooks while driving carts. The entire army has become a huge cultural school.
    The officers and soldiers have also created many effective learning methods. For example, the "writing a sentence" movement in a certain unit has now been promoted in many troops, and some companies have achieved the point where everyone writes a sentence using the words they have learned every day. Soldiers in each class and platoon communicate with each other, practicing writing and exchanging experiences at the same time. Troops participating in agricultural and sideline production have also persisted in learning during their busy work. A certain division stationed in Changchun organized mutual aid learning groups for plowing, sowing, and weeding during the spring plowing season, set up literacy signs on the fields, and everyone learned during breaks. When a certain division stationed in Shenyang was repairing the Hun River dam, some soldiers carried soil, and the two people in front and behind also exchanged sentences in question and answer. Now, the machine gun squad of the 4th company of a certain unit constructing the Shenyang-Dalian highway learns an average of four or five characters per person per day. Many soldiers in a certain division participating in factory production wrote new words on the backs of their hands and learned while pushing ore carts. Because the soldiers have a high degree of enthusiasm for learning, coupled with the leadership's attention, the cultural level of all officers and soldiers has improved rapidly. In a certain division with faster progress, more than 94 percent of the personnel had learned more than 300 characters by the end of April. Half of the personnel in the 6th company of a certain regiment of the division were literate in more than 1,000 characters. In another division, 57 percent of the personnel had learned integer four arithmetic operations in arithmetic class, and 41 percent had learned decimal four arithmetic operations. The communications battalion of the division universally learned 500 characters in three months during the busy farming season.
    In order to further strengthen the cultural learning of the troops, the Northeast Military Region convened a political work conference in May, which determined that from around September to the end of next year, the education of the entire army would shift to cultural learning as the main focus. Formal education plans have been drawn up, and all troops are actively preparing on a large scale to welcome the high tide of cultural learning.

　　半年多部队文化学习进步迅速
    东北全军达到人人识字
    【本报沈阳讯】人民解放军东北军区部队，从去年冬季开始，结合练兵、生产，开展了大规模的文化学习运动。现在，全军已没有了不识字的指战员，半数人员达到识字五百以上的水平。在学习中，每一连队都按战士文化程度分编了班次，由连队的文化教员担任授课；并发动了互助互教。各部都建立了正规课程、定期测验、升降级等制度。驻安东某师，并设置了文化奖金，奖励文化学习成绩优异的单位与个人。在高度政治觉悟的基础上，全体指战员自觉地把学习文化当成政治任务而努力不懈。每天除操课外，干部战士随时随地在一块读书、写字，已养成了学习的习惯。炊事员烧火时也练习写字，饲养员一面赶车一面读课本。全军变成了一所巨大的文化学校。
    指战员们并创造了许多有效的学习方法。如某部的“写话”运动，现已在许多部队推广，有的连队已做到每人每天都用学过的字写一句话。各班、排战士之间互相通信，一面练习写作，一面交流经验。参加农、副业生产的部队，在紧张的工作中同样坚持了学习。驻长春某师在春耕时，按不同的劳动组织了拉犁、播种、拔草等互助学习组，地头上设立识字牌，休息时大家学习。驻沈阳某师在修浑河堤坝时，有的战士抬着土，前后两人还互相联句问答。现在修筑沈（阳）大（连）公路的某部四连机枪一班，每人每天平均学会了四、五个字。参加工厂生产的某师，许多战士把生字写在手背上，一面推矿石车一面学习。因为战士们有高度的学习热情，再加以领导上的重视，全军指战员的文化程度提高得很快。进步较快的某师，在四月底已有百分之九十四以上的人员学会三百字以上。该师某团六连有半数人员识千字以上。另师有百分之五十七的人员的算术课学到了整数四则题，百分之四十一学到了小数四则。该师通讯营在农忙中三个月普遍学会了五百字。
    为了进一步加强部队文化学习，东北军区于五月间召开了政治工作会议，确定在九月前后到明年年底，全军的教育转入以文化学习为主。正规的教育计划已经拟定，各部队正积极进行大规模的准备工作，以迎接文化学习的高潮。
