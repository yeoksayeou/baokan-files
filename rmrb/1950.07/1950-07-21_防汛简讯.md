Flood Control Briefs

    Daxing's Flood Control Work is Paralyzed; Lack of Vigilance Makes Disasters Inevitable

    In the second district section of Yongding River in Daxing County, the riverbed is two stories higher than the village. The second phase of reinforcement project has not been completed and accepted. After rain, many rat and badger holes were found on the levee, and the collapsed ditches were not repaired. The levee near Zhao Village is leaking water and the depth is more than a foot, but the villagers along the levee believe that the levee has been heightened and thickened, and there is a serious sense of paralysis. The division of labor among village cadres is not clear, and flood control materials are not adequately prepared. If the county does not increase its vigilance as soon as possible, there is a risk of disaster if the water rises too fast.

    Xianghe Inspects Dikes and Finds Nine Major Dangers

    The Xianghe County Flood Control Headquarters began inspecting the 320-mile-long dikes of the county's four major rivers (Qinglong River, Beiyun River, Jiangan River, and Chaobai River Diversion Channel) on June 21. The inspection revealed nine major dangerous dikes. In Qinglong River alone, five major dangerous dikes, fifty-nine minor dangerous dikes, eight rat and badger nests, and ten leaks were found. If they are not repaired quickly, there is a risk of disaster when the water rises, and there is a danger of flooding Xianghe, Wuqing, and Ninghe counties, as well as the new dike of Chaobai River. The county flood control headquarters has prepared a repair plan and guarantees to complete the repairs before the flood season.

    Cangxian Prefecture Suffers from Flooding; Actively Organizing Drainage

    Due to continuous cloudy and rainy days for nearly half a month, Jian’guo, Cangxian, Jiaohe, Qingxian, Dacheng, Jinghai and other counties in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, have suffered from flooding, inundating a total of 200,000 mu of land, with 90,000 mu inundated in Jian’guo County alone. The prefectural commissioner's office is actively consulting with the Tianjin prefectural commissioner's office to find ways to drain the accumulated water into Jia Kou depression. However, attention should be paid to educating the masses, subordinating small interests to large interests, resolving drainage disputes, and discharging water in a timely and smooth manner to reduce the damage caused.

    Anci Neglects Flood Control Work and Suffers Unnecessary Losses

    On June 30, the Yongding River water rose sharply. The Tianjin Prefecture immediately issued an emergency notice to all counties, and twice telegraphed Anci and Wuqing to quickly prepare for rescue and flood control. Anci was busy with the summer tax collection, and some district and village cadres had a serious sense of paralysis, and the preparation work had not been done well. On the night of July 1, when the flood rose sharply, the Anlang dike was breached, destroying 35,000 mu of rice seedlings. After receiving the emergency notice, the armed forces minister and the county party committee immediately led cadres in the rain to rescue and defend, so that even the most dangerous Si Shang did not experience any danger when the flood arrived.

    Continuous Heavy Rains Cause River Water to Rise Sharply; Huaiyin Prefecture Suffers Floods

    Excessive rainfall in Huaiyin Prefecture, northern Jiangsu Province, in late June has caused flooding. According to incomplete statistics from Zhangji, Wuji, Shizi, and Hudong districts in Shuyang County, more than 190,000 mu of autumn crops have been flooded. 415 square li in Nangang District of Guanyun County was flooded, two-thirds of Shuhong District was flooded, and all 19 townships in Yangji District were flooded. The Baima River, Long River, and Tong River in Suining County have all overflowed their banks one after another, and most of the county's autumn crops have been flooded. In Guanshan District alone, 70,000 mu of autumn crops have been flooded. The prefectural commissioner's office has telegraphed all counties to focus on flood control, urgently drain water, rescue rice seedlings, complete rush planting and hoeing, and carry out production for disaster preparedness.

    Hongchuan Prefecture's Floods Overflow; Henan Provincial Government Allocates Grain for Relief

    Hongchuan Prefecture, Henan Province, has just stopped a long drought and has now suffered flooding. From the end of June to the beginning of July, there was continuous heavy rain, and the water level of the Hong and Huai Rivers within the territory rose sharply, two feet higher than the water level in previous years. The river embankment has not breached, but the flood has overflowed, and the area along the river is a vast expanse of water. Four districts on the west bank of Luoshan County have also been affected, with a total affected population of about 500,000 and more than one million mu of flooded rice fields. The Henan Provincial Government has allocated 1.2 million catties of grain and sent special personnel to the disaster area to express condolences and provide relief to the disaster victims. The leaders at the prefecture, county, and district levels have also personally entered the disaster area to lead the disaster victims in protecting the dikes and rescuing them day and night, and to carry out disaster relief work. At the same time, they are organizing the masses to replant late autumn crops and carry out production for self-rescue.

    Ji Luan River Spring Project Committee Selectively Increases Repair and Risk Mitigation Projects

    In order to ensure that the Ji Yun River will no longer breach during general floods before the New Chaobai River releases water, the Ji Luan River Spring Project Committee of Hebei Province has decided to selectively increase repair and risk mitigation projects on the left bank and the right bank above Ruizhuangzi. After surveying the various places where the project should be strengthened and changed, it has been approved by the higher authorities and has already started construction while preparing plans. Most of the project can be completed by the end of June. After the completion of this project, about two million mu of farmland can be spared from flooding during general floods.

　　防汛简讯
    大兴防汛工作麻痹如不警惕难免出险
    永定河大兴县二区段，河身比村庄高出两丈上下，二次补修工程迄未交工验收，下雨后又发现堤上有许多鼠洞獾穴，坍塌沟槽也未加修理。赵村透堤水已深尺多，而沿堤村民以为堤身已加高加厚，严重存在着麻痹思想。村干分工不明确，防汛材料也准备不充分。该县如不及早提高警惕，一旦涨水过猛，将有出险之虞。

    香河检查堤埝发现九处大险
    香河县防汛指挥部，已于六月二十一日，开始全县四道主要河流（青龙河、北运河、箭杆河、潮白河分洪道）三百二十里长的堤埝的检查工作。检查结果，发现有九处大险堤。仅青龙河即发现大险堤五处，小险堤五十九处，鼠窝、獾洞八处，漏洞十处。如不急速修好，水涨时即有出险可能，并有冲淹香河、武清、宁河各县及潮白河新堤的危险。该县防汛指挥部已拟好补修计划，并保证在汛前修好。

    沧县专区雨水成灾现正积极组织排水
    河北沧县专区建国、沧县、交河、青县、大城、静海等县，因近半月来连日阴雨，积水成灾，共淹地二十万亩，仅建国一县即淹地九万亩。现该专署正积极和天津专署洽商，设法排除积水入贾口洼。但应注意教育群众，小利益服从大利益，解决排水纠纷，及时顺利排泄，以减轻所造成的灾害。
                              （陈作舟）
    安次忽视防汛工作遭受不应有的损失
    六月三十日，永定河水猛涨，天津专区当即向各县发出紧急通知，并两次电告安次、武清迅速作抢险防汛准备。安次因忙于夏征，若干区村干部又严重存在麻痹思想，准备工作迄未作好。到七月一日夜洪水猛涨，安廊堤就遭决口，淹毁禾苗三万五千亩。武清接到紧急通知后，武装部长与县委等即冒雨率领干部抢护防守，致洪水到来，最险的泗上也未发生危险。

    连日大雨河水暴涨淮阴专区发生水灾
    苏北淮阴专区六月下旬大雨过量，已酿成水灾，据沭阳县章集、吴集、十字、湖东等区不完全统计，共淹掉秋禾十九万多亩。灌云县南岗区被淹四百一十五平方华里，曙红区淹掉三分之二，杨集区十九个乡全部淹没。睢宁县之白马河、龙河、潼河皆已先后漫埝，全县秋禾大部被淹，仅官山一区就有七万亩秋禾被淹。该专区现已电令各县抓紧防汛，紧急排水，抢救禾苗，完成抢种抢锄，进行生产备荒。

    潢川专区洪水外溢河南省府拨粮救济
    河南潢川专区久旱刚止，又遭水灾。六月底到七月初连日大雨，境内之洪淮河水位暴涨，较往年水位高二尺，河堤未决但洪水外溢、沿河一片汪洋、为多年未有的大水。罗山县西岸四个区也波及受灾，全区受灾人口约五十万，被淹禾田百余万亩。河南省府已拨粮一百二十万斤，并派专人赴灾区慰问、救济灾民。专区、县、区各级负责人也亲入灾区领导灾民昼夜护堤抢险并进行赈济等工作。同时组织群众补种晚秋，生产自救。

    蓟滦河春工委员会择要增加修险工程
    河北省蓟滦河春工委员会，为保证蓟运河于新潮白河放水前，在一般洪水时不再决口，决定在左堤及芮庄子以上右堤择要增加修险工程。在应当增强与变更工程的各处经过查勘后，业经上级批准，并已一面赶制计划，一面动工，大部工程可于六月底完成。此一工程完竣后，约有二百万亩农田在一般洪水时可免水灾。
