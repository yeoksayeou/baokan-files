Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: The Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army encountered serious defects in ordering goods from private enterprises. The Southwest Military Region and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee have jointly issued a decision to correct them. In the past six months, the Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region ordered 61 kinds of military supplies from private factories in Chongqing, worth more than 20 billion RMB. This large order could have played a significant role in adjusting industry and commerce and the relationship between public and private sectors locally. However, the Logistics Department did not go through the Municipal People's Government's Enterprise Bureau to conduct the ordering in an organized and planned manner, resulting in many serious defects. The main defect was that the Logistics Department did not appropriately and carefully handle the contradiction between large order quantities and small production capacity, so that the large orders failed to better help the industries accepting the orders overcome the difficulty of product backlog, but instead caused abnormal development in some industries. For example, the rubber industry's monthly production of rubber shoes was 90,000 pairs, while the order was for 1.12 million pairs. After grabbing the business, factories added machines and hired workers. For example, Lihua Rubber Factory added equipment worth 400 million RMB. The number of workers in two rubber factories increased from about 100 to about 250. This has repeatedly expanded production, and wages have also repeatedly increased. When orders stopped, production stagnated, and labor-management disputes increased. Secondly, the Logistics Department did not understand the production capacity of each factory, and did not convene meetings with each industry to negotiate and reasonably allocate the order quantity. They were deceived and misled by some speculative factory owners and corrupt and derelict old personnel, resulting in significant losses. For example, when ordering towels and socks from the towel and knitwear industry, some factory owners contracted large quantities and resold them for kickbacks, while others did not receive any orders at all. At the same time, the prices of the orders were also high and low, which was extremely unreasonable. When it came time to deliver the goods, many factory owners could not deliver the goods or the quality of the delivered goods did not meet the standards.
    After the above phenomenon occurred, the Southwest Military Region and the Southwest Financial Committee immediately pointed out that the Logistics Department's practice of detaching itself from the leadership of the People's Government and disregarding the overall situation had caused new difficulties for the People's Government's work of adjusting industry and commerce. In order to correct this deviation, the Southwest Military Region and the Southwest Financial Committee jointly issued a decision in late June, stipulating that all large-scale purchases, entrusted processing and ordering must be planned and appropriately allocated through the local industrial and commercial trade authorities. Local and various levels of trade authorities should frequently and proactively contact the military supply agencies and report the production and sales of various enterprises to the Southwest Financial Committee, so that the leading agencies can uniformly purchase, entrust processing, and regulate the production of various enterprises within an appropriate scope. All agencies should promptly clear accounts and urge delivery for the goods that have been ordered and processed in the past. All agencies must strictly examine the personnel in charge of this work in their own agencies, punish corrupt and derelict officials; and those private merchants who speculate and deceive should be reported to the government for investigation.

　　西南军区后勤军需部
    定货中发生严重缺点
    西南军区和财委予以纠正
    【本报讯】新华社重庆讯：人民解放军西南军区后勤军需部在向私营企业定货中，发生严重缺点。西南军区及西南军政委员会财政经济委员会已联合发布决定予以纠正。西南军区后勤军需部半年来向重庆私营工厂定购军用品达六十一种，价值在人民币二百亿元以上。这批大宗定货，本来对于当地调整工商业和公私关系是可以发挥很大作用的。但该军需部没有通过市人民政府企业局，有组织、有计划地进行定货，致发生许多严重缺点。主要的缺点是该军需部没有适当而周密地处理定货数量大和生产能力小的矛盾，以致未能使大宗定货更好地帮助接受定货的各该行业克服产品滞销的困难，反而造成某些行业的畸形发展。如橡胶业每月产胶鞋为九万双，而定货则达一百一十二万双。各厂在强揽生意后就添机器，招工人。如利华橡胶厂添增设备值四亿元。有两家橡胶厂工人均由一百人增加至二百五十人左右。这样使生产一再扩大，工资也一再增加。当定货停止时，生产即陷于停顿，劳资纠纷亦随之加多。其次，军需部不了解各工厂生产能力，又没有召集各该行业开会协商，合理地分配定货数量，被某些投机厂户和贪污渎职的旧人员蒙蔽欺骗，造成重大损失。如向毛巾和针织业定购毛巾、袜子时，有的厂户即大量包揽，转手收取回扣，有的厂户则根本没有接到定货。同时定货的价格也有高有低，极不合理。到交货时，许多厂户交不出货或交的货质量不合标准。
    上述现象发生后，西南军区和西南财委立即指出该军需部这种脱离人民政府领导、不顾全局的作法，已使人民政府调整工商业的工作遇到新的困难。为纠正此一偏向，西南军区和西南财委已于六月下旬联合发布决定，规定：一切较大规模的采购、委托加工和定货都必须作出计划，通过当地工商贸易机关适当分配。各地及各级贸易机关应经常主动与军需机关取得联系，并向西南财委报告各种企业的产销情况，使领导机关可能在适当范围内统一采购、委托加工、调节各种企业的生产。各机关对过去已定货加工的货品，应迅速了清账目，催促交货。各机关要严格审查本机关经办此项工作的人员，惩办贪污渎职分子；对私商中之投机欺骗者，应报请政府追究。
