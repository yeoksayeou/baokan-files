Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: In response to the call from the World Federation of Trade Unions to support the Korean people's war of liberation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) invited representatives from leading bodies of national people's organizations in Beijing on the 10th to discuss launching a nationwide campaign against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. Forty-two representatives from various organizations attended. It was decided at the meeting to hold an "Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Campaign Week" throughout China starting on the 17th, so that the people of the whole country can more clearly understand the conspiracy and facts of the American imperialists' aggression in the Far East, take active actions to oppose American aggression against Taiwan, and support the Korean people's war of liberation.

The convener of the meeting, Liu Ningyi, representative of the ACFTU, reported at the meeting: "The World Federation of Trade Unions has called on the working class of the world to support the Korean people's war of liberation and launched a 'Support Korea People Week' starting on the 7th. The behavior of American imperialism in interfering in China and Korea has aroused the anger and widespread opposition of the people of the world. In order to express the Chinese people's will and determination to defend peace, we resolutely support the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions. In order to adapt to China's situation and combine the support for the Korean people's war of liberation with the facts of opposing American aggression against Taiwan, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions suggests launching an Anti-American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Campaign Week across the country." Representatives of various people's organizations unanimously agreed with the proposal of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in their speeches, and believed that various propaganda methods should be used to ensure that this movement can penetrate into all levels of people across the country.

The meeting resolved to establish the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea to lead this movement. The people's organizations elected to form the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea include the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, The China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All- China Students' Federation, All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the China People's Relief Association, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, a total of eleven units.
