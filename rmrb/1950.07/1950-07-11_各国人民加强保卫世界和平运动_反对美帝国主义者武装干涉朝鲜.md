People of All Countries Strengthen the Movement to Defend World Peace
Oppose the U.S. Imperialists' Armed Intervention in Korea

Soviet Writers and Scientists Call for the Defense of Peace

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: According to TASS, Moscow, July 7th: Soviet newspapers have been publishing numerous articles and letters from writers, artists, scientists, workers, and peasants for days, all angrily condemning the American imperialists' aggression in Korea and calling for the strengthening of the movement to defend peace.

The famous composer Shostakovich wrote in Izvestia: True artists, whether sculptors or poets, composers or singers, cannot stand aloof from the struggle for peace. Art can only become art when it struggles against reactionary fascist ideas, when it supports the friendly, creative cooperation of all peoples, and when it loves progressive ideas of mankind. The sacred duty of cultural workers is to promote the friendship and mutual understanding of all peoples through their creative endeavors, and to expand the front for peace. United we are indestructible!

The famous writer Polevoi wrote in Pravda: Those who signed the Peace Declaration in the Soviet Union are those who liberated Europe from fascist enslavement, those who saved European civilization, those who shocked all mankind with their immortal feats in Stalingrad and Leningrad, and those who raised the banner of victory over the fortresses of the fascist bandits. They unanimously demanded the prohibition of the atomic bomb and shouted: "American imperialists, get out of Korea!"

Farmers from Belarus wrote in a letter to Izvestia: "Yesterday American planes dropped potato beetles on German soil, and today they are dropping bombs on Korean soil. This is the fruit of capitalist civilization, this is the policy of imperialists—the haters of mankind! We sign the Peace Declaration to express our hatred for the barbarians of the twentieth century, and we are confident that victory will surely belong to us."

The famous writer Sobolev wrote in Pravda: The atrocities that have occurred must be stopped, and they can certainly be stopped. Those who can stop these atrocities are we—billions of people—because we represent all of humanity.

Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: TASS, Moscow: Academician Zilinsky of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a ninety-year-old scientist, said in a speech published in the Red Navy newspaper on July 7th: In these tense days, when the fate of mankind is threatened, when we see new evidence of the aggressive actions of the American warmongers every day, I cannot remain silent.

I would like to express my opinion in unison with the billions of honest people in the world, we all understand: it is not enough to merely hope for peace, we must fight for peace passionately and powerfully.

I have dedicated myself to science for more than sixty years, which gives me the right to ask all honest and free scientists on earth to listen to me. We cannot sit idly by while the barbarians of the twentieth century prepare to ignite the flames of world war and prepare to drop atomic bombs on cities!

We, the scientific workers, have a responsibility to expose and eliminate the incorrect theory that a new war is inevitable. I urge all scientific and cultural workers in the world, I urge all honest fighters for peace, to consolidate world peace with their labor, their enlightening activities, their active struggle for peace, and their exposure of the warmongers. Those engaged in creative endeavors and cultural work must unite with people from all walks of life to fight for lasting peace in the world.

German Peace Committee Calls for Defending Korea

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: Comprehensive TASS, Berlin news: The German Peace Committee held an enlarged meeting in Berlin in early July to discuss various measures to strengthen the struggle for peace. The meeting adopted a work plan as a guideline for peace committees throughout Germany and a letter to the German people.

Mang, representing the citizens of Munich, said at the meeting: Although the American occupation authorities have tried to obstruct the peace movement in various ways, eleven state peace committees have been established in West Germany, and peace conferences have been held in eight states.

The meeting adopted the work plan of the Preparatory Committee for the Second World Peace Congress, stating: The peace committees of the German Democratic Republic have successfully collected more than 17 million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal. Now, as we prepare for the Second World Peace Congress, the decisive task of the peace movement is to ensure this success politically and organizationally.

The plan also outlines specific instructions on organizing and political activities, strengthening the activities of rural peace advocates, and improving the joint work of the German Peace Committee and committees in West Germany.

The conference passed a declaration calling on the German people to organize conferences to defend Korea, to organize protest rallies against the preparation for war in West Germany, and to not allow West Germany to become a military springboard and a depot for the Americans to gather recruits.

American People Accelerate Peace Signatures

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: TASS, New York, July 7th: On July 5th, the Youth Committee for Supporting the World Peace Declaration issued a statement saying that American youth organizations had collected 200,000 signatures for the Stockholm Appeal, of which 100,000 signatures were collected after Truman ordered armed intervention in Korea. The Worker's Daily reported that in many places in the United States, such as Philadelphia, the work of collecting signatures was carried out under conditions of police terror. In order to undermine the peace movement, the police arrested many peace movement propagandists.

The Worker's Daily, Los Angeles dispatch: The Local Committee of the United Furniture Workers Union Workshop has passed a resolution demanding that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from Korea and condemning military intervention by any country. This committee, representing workers from fifty-two furniture factories and workshops, has submitted this resolution to Truman. The committee also passed a decision to intensify the collection of signatures for the Stockholm Appeal in various departments of the furniture industry. Lawrence, the chairman of the Local Branch of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, called on the local branches of the union to immediately begin collecting signatures. The local unions of the Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers Union and the Mining, Milling and Smelting Workers Union also signed the Stockholm Appeal.

Veterans who fought in the Lincoln Brigade for the independence of Spain against fascism fiercely criticized the American imperialists' aggressive actions in Korea, and compared this intervention with the actions of the Hitlerites who stood on the side of Spanish fascism to interfere in Spain.

About eight hundred people participated in the 23rd Anniversary Celebration of Labor Independence Day in Cleveland, Ohio. Hall, the secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party, delivered a speech at the celebration. After condemning the American armed intervention in Korea, Hall emphasized: "The best way to express the desire for peace is to intensify the collection of signatures for the Stockholm Appeal." The celebration also announced that Ohio had collected 50,000 signatures.

Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: Telecommunication Agency, New York, July 6th: The Brooklyn Branch of the New York Labor Peace Conference announced that 145,000 people in Brooklyn, New York, have signed the Peace Declaration. The American militarists' plan to incite war hysteria over their provocative actions in Korea, thereby attacking the peace movement, has clearly failed. As Garrett, an unemployed young black woman and signature collector, said: "The situation in Korea gave people a warning, making them more eager to sign." Wexler, a member of the American peace fighters and the Labor Youth League, who collected 1,400 signatures, said: Since the Korean incident, one of the most powerful ways to get signatures is to take out the photo of Dulles, the number one war-monger in the United States, in the trenches of Syngman Rhee.

Japanese Peace Association to Collect 40 Million Signatures

Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: TASS, July 9th telegram quoting Japanese newspaper Liberation News: The Japanese Association for the Defense of Peace held a meeting with representatives from various democratic organizations. The meeting discussed measures to collect 40 million signatures in Japan for the Stockholm Appeal. The meeting passed a resolution stating that the peace movement must become the center of activities for all democratic organizations, and the prohibition of atomic weapons must become the program of this movement. The meeting believes that it is extremely important to expand the front for the defense of peace in Japan as much as possible.

In recent days, several peace rallies have been held in Japan. On July 2nd, a youth conference was held in Shimojo Town, Kyoto, attended by one thousand people, each of whom signed the Stockholm Appeal. On June 30th, a student peace conference was held at Shimo-jo (transliteration) University, where one thousand four hundred people signed the Peace Declaration. The three thousand two hundred workers at the Japanese shipyard also decided to sign the Stockholm Appeal.

　　各国人民加强保卫世界和平运动
    反对美帝国主义者武装干涉朝鲜
    苏作家、科学家号召保卫和平
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联报纸连日刊载了作家、艺术家、科学家、工人和农民的许多文章和函件，他们愤怒地谴责美国帝国主义的侵略朝鲜，并号召加强保卫和平的运动。
    著名作曲家萧斯塔柯维奇在消息报撰文称：真正的艺术工作者，不论是雕刻家或是诗人，作曲家或是歌手，都不能超然于争取和平的斗争之外。艺术只有在它与反动的法西斯思想斗争的时候，在它拥护各族人民的友好、创造性的合作和热爱人类的进步思想的时候，才能成为艺术。文化工作者的神圣职责，是以他们的创造性的努力来促进各族人民的友好和互相了解，以扩展争取和平的阵线。我们团结在一起就是不可摧毁的！
    名作家波列伏依在真理报撰文称：在苏联，在和平宣言上签名的人们，便是把欧洲从法西斯奴役下解放出来的人们，便是拯救了欧洲文明的人们，便是用他们在斯大林格勒和列宁格勒的不朽伟迹震惊了全人类的人们，便是在法西斯的匪徒的城堡上升起了胜利旗帜的人们。他们一致要求禁止原子弹，并且高呼：“美国帝国主义者退出朝鲜去！”
    白俄罗斯的农民给消息报的信上写道：“昨天美国飞机在德国的土地上投掷了马铃薯甲虫，今天在朝鲜土地上投掷了炸弹，这就是资本主义文明的果实，这就是帝国主义者——仇恨人类的人们的政策！我们签名于和平宣言，表示我们对二十世纪的野蛮人的憎恨，并且确信胜利必然属于我们。”
    名作家索波列夫在真理报撰文称：现已发生的暴行必须予以制止，而且一定能制止。能制止这些暴行的就是我们——亿万的人民，因为我们代表着全人类。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院院士、九十岁的老科学家齐林斯基，于七日在红海军报上发表谈话称：在这些紧张的日子里，在人类的命运被威胁着的时候，当我们每天都看到美国战争贩子的侵略行为的新证据的时候，我实在不能缄默了。
    我愿意和世界上亿万正直的人民同声发表意见，我们都了解：仅仅希望和平是不够的，必须热情而有力地为和平而斗争。
    我已献身科学六十余年，这使得我有权利要求地球上一切正直而自由的科学家倾听我的话。我们不能坐视二十世纪的野蛮人准备燃起全世界的烽火，准备在城市上空扔下原子炸弹！
    我们科学工作者，有责任揭露并消灭那种认为新战争必不可免的不正确的理论。我敦促世界上一切科学工作者与文化工作者，敦促一切正直的和平斗士，以他们的劳动，他们的启发性的活动，以他们争取和平的积极斗争，以及对战争贩子的揭露，来巩固世界和平。从事创造性努力和文化工作的人们，必须和各行各业的人民汇合在一起，为全世界的持久和平而斗争。
            德和平委员会呼吁保卫朝鲜
    【新华社八日讯】综合塔斯社柏林消息：德国和平委员会于七月初在柏林举行扩大会议，讨论加强和平斗争的各项措施。会上通过了作为全德各地和平委员会指针的工作计划以及告德国人民书。
    曼格代表慕尼黑的市民在会上称：虽然美国占领当局力图用各种方法阻挠和平运动，但西德已成立了十一个州和平委员会，并有八个州已举行了和平大会。
    会上通过第二届世界拥护和平大会筹备委员会的工作计划称：德意志民主共和国的各和平委员会，已成功地征集了一千七百多万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。现在，当筹备第二届世界拥护和平大会时，和平运动的决定性任务，便是在政治上与组织上确保这个成功。
    该计划并规划了关于组织与政治活动的各项具体指示，加强乡村和平拥护者的活动，以及改善德国和平委员会与西德各委员会联合进行工作的指示。
    大会通过宣言，呼吁德国人民组织保卫朝鲜的大会，组织反对在西德准备战争的抗议大会，不要让西德变成军事跳板和美国人聚集募兵的贮藏所。
            美国人民加速进行和平签名
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：七月五日，青年拥护世界和平宣言委员会发表声明称：美国的青年组织已为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了二十万人的签名，其中有十万签名是在杜鲁门下令武装干涉朝鲜后征集的。工人日报报道：在美国许多地方，例如在费城，征集签名的工作是在警察采取恐怖手段的条件下进行的。为了破坏和平运动，警察逮捕了许多和平运动的宣传者。
    工人日报洛杉矶来讯称：联合家具工人工会车间地方委员会已通过决议，要求美军立即撤出朝鲜，并谴责任何国家所进行的军事干涉。这个代表五十二家家具工厂与工场工人的委员会，已把这个决议提交杜鲁门。该委员会并通过了在家具业各部门加紧为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的决定。国际码头与仓库工人工会地方分会主席劳伦士，呼吁该工会各地方分会立即开始征集签名。电气无线电与机器工人工会，矿业磨坊及冶金工人工会地方工会，也在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。
    曾经在林肯旅中为争取西班牙的独立反对法西斯主义作过战的退伍军人，猛烈斥责美国帝国主义者在朝鲜的侵略行为，并把这个干涉行动与希特勒分子站在西班牙法西斯主义一边干涉西班牙的行动作一对比。
    约有八百人参加了在俄亥俄州克利夫兰举行的劳工独立日二十三周年纪念会。共产党全国委员会书记霍尔在纪念会上发表演说。霍尔在斥责美国武装干涉朝鲜之后，强调称：“表现对和平的愿望的最好方法，乃是加紧为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名。”纪念会并宣布俄亥俄州已征集了五万人的签名。
    【新华社八日讯】电通社纽约六日讯：纽约劳工和平会议布鲁克林分会宣布：纽约布鲁克林区有十四万五千人已在和平宣言上签名。美国军国主义者想就他们在朝鲜的挑衅行为引起战争歇斯底里，从而打击和平运动的计划显然是落空了。正如一个签名征集者、失业的年青黑人妇女加瑞特所说：“朝鲜的情势给人民一个警告，使他们更加热望签名了。”一个人征集了一千四百人签名的美国和平战士、劳动青年同盟的会员韦克斯勒说：自从朝鲜事件发生之后，要得到签名的最有力的办法之一，就是拿出美国头号战争贩子杜勒斯在李承晚的壕沟中的照片。
            日和平协会将征集四千万人签名
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社九日电引日本报纸解放新闻消息：日本保卫和平协会举行了有各民主组织的代表参加的会议。会议讨论了在日本征集四千万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的措施。会议通过决议称：和平运动必须成为一切民主组织活动的中心，禁止原子武器必须成为这一运动的纲领。会议认为在日本尽可能地扩大保卫和平阵线是极端重要的。
    近几天来，日本举行了若干次保卫和平的集会。七月二日，在京都的下庄镇举行了青年大会，有一千人出席，他们每一个人都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。六月三十日，下条（译音）的大学举行了学生保卫和平大会，会上有一千四百人在和平宣言上签了名。日本造船厂的三千二百名工人，也决定在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。
