Serious Waste Occurs in Production at State-Owned and Publicly-Owned Factories and Mines Across the Country
    Existing Equipment is Not Fully Utilized, Accidents Occur Constantly
    Neglect of Product Quality Results in a Large Number of Defective Products and Rework

    [This Newspaper] News: At present, state-owned and publicly-owned factories and mines across the country have achieved great successes in the rapid recovery and development of production. However, due to a lack of experience in enterprise management and guidance in science and technology, as well as a lack of a high sense of responsibility for the people's property on the part of individual factory and mine leaders, serious waste has occurred in industrial production.
    The most significant waste in industrial production lies in the failure to fully utilize existing equipment and to fully exploit the effectiveness of machinery. Looking at heavy industry, the degree to which iron and steel smelting equipment is currently utilized reaches, at most, only 75% of its effectiveness, while the machinery manufacturing industry only utilizes 50% of its equipment's effectiveness. In 1949, the equipment utilization rate of state-owned power plants in Northeast China, North China, and East China was only 24%. If this could be increased to 40-45% within two or three years, the power supply capacity of existing equipment could be doubled. From this, it can be seen the importance of fully exploiting the effectiveness of machinery for the recovery and development of industrial production.
    Factories and mines in various regions have not genuinely established the concept of safe production, and accidents occur constantly, also causing huge losses and waste to the people's property. At the First National Coal Mine Conference last November, it was clearly stipulated that the principle of safe production should guide the completion of production tasks. In the past six months, through the joint efforts of mine leaders and workers, the mine safety work has improved compared to before, but accidents are still serious. According to statistics from state-owned coal mines in Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central and Southern China in the first quarter, a total of 6,878 accidents of various sizes occurred. Particularly serious was the explosion at the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan on February 7. This incident not only reduced coal production by 4,000 tons but also incurred expenses for burial, compensation, and repair work, totaling over 1.8 million catties of wheat equivalent. Even more serious was the death of 174 workers, the disability of 2, and minor injuries to 24. The accident involving the collapse of the cement cover of the Benxi Vertical Shaft also resulted in a loss of over 240 million Northeast currency. In May, state-owned iron and steel plants and mines in North China experienced 30 major accidents. On May 18, the derailment of two freight cars in the transportation section of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant resulted in the damage of one turnout screw and 300 sleepers, equivalent to 10,900 catties of millet. If the losses suffered from these accidents were invested in production, it would be a huge amount of capital, directly contributing to the recovery and development of our industrial production.
    Most factories and mines lack sound systems in enterprise management, particularly in implementing the responsibility system and strict product inspection system. There is also a lack of education for workers, leading to a widespread tendency to simply pursue quantity while neglecting quality, resulting in serious waste from defective products and rework. Before the Guanghe Machinery Factory in Dalian and Lushun corrected the tendency to neglect product inspection in January of this year, the amount of rework in November of last year was 1,170 pieces, and the number of defective products was 280. In December, the amount of rework increased to 1,259 pieces, and the number of defective products was 194, causing significant losses in production. The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant completely failed to meet its plan to produce six-foot boxcar lathes in the first quarter of this year due to a lack of strict production discipline and production responsibility system. The Central China Iron and Steel Company did not properly store raw materials or establish a system, and many valuable materials were left outdoors, exposed to rust and corrosion. According to statistics on the loss of refractory bricks alone, the loss was equivalent to 40,000 dan of rice. Poor production planning and inaccurate drawings also resulted in a constant stream of wasteful labor and rework. As for the tendency to blindly pursue quantity, neglect quality, and even damage machinery in production competitions, this is also very common. The steel rolling department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is one example. Because the plant did not establish a production responsibility system and operating procedures during the competition, it only focused on pursuing quantity and did not adequately care for the machinery, resulting in the twisting and cracking of the "X-shaped joint" of the medium-sized rolling mill, causing a serious accident. It is estimated that it will take at least twelve days to repair, and steel production will be reduced by more than 1,500 tons, reducing income by over 10 million catties of millet equivalent. In contrast, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant established a strict handover system, rectified labor discipline, and completed its production plan ahead of schedule in June, reversing the unfavorable situation of not completing production tasks in the first five months of this year, and was commended by the Northeast Industrial Department.

### 各地国营和公营工厂矿山生产中有严重浪费现象  没有充分利用已有设备事故不断发生  忽视产品质量造成大量废品和返工活

　　各地国营和公营工厂矿山生产中有严重浪费现象
    没有充分利用已有设备事故不断发生
    忽视产品质量造成大量废品和返工活
    【本报讯】目前全国各地国营和公营工厂矿山，在生产迅速恢复和发展中，虽然获得了巨大成绩，但是，因为缺乏企业管理经验和科学技术的指导，以及个别厂矿负责人缺乏对人民财富的高度责任心，因而造成了工业生产中的严重浪费现象。
    工业生产中最主要的浪费，在于没有充分利用已有的设备，没有充分发挥机械的效能。就重工业方面来看：目前炼铁炼钢设备被利用的程度至多只达到其效能的百分之七十五，机器制造业则仅利用其设备效能的百分之五十。一九四九年东北、华北、华东国营发电厂的设备利用率，仅为百分之二十四，在两三年内如能提高到百分之四十至四十五，即可较现有设备的供电能力提高一倍。由此可见，充分发挥机械效能对恢复与发展工业生产的重要性。
    各地工厂矿山没有切实树立保安生产的思想，事故不断发生，也给人民财富招致了巨大的损失和浪费。在去年十一月全国第一次煤矿会议上，即已明确规定了在保安生产的原则下，完成生产任务的方针。半年来，在各矿领导和职工的共同努力下，虽然矿山保安工作较前已有改进，但事故仍然是严重的。据第一季度东北、华北、华东、中南区各国营煤矿统计，共发生大小事故六八七八次，其中特别严重的是二月七日河南宜洛煤矿爆炸事件。在此事件中，不仅减产煤四千吨，并开支埋葬、抚恤、抢修工程等费共折麦子一百八十余万斤。尤为严重的是死亡工人一七四名，残废二名，轻伤二四名。本溪竖井洋灰盖坠落事故，亦损失东北币两亿四千余万元。华北国营各钢铁厂矿，在五月份中发生主要事故三十次。五月十八日，石景山钢铁厂运输课货车两辆脱轨事故，即损毁道岔螺丝一个，枕石三百根，共折合小米一○、九○○斤。如果把这些事故所遭受的损失投之于生产，那将是一笔巨大的资金，直接有助于我们工业生产的恢复和发展。
    大部分工厂矿山，因为在企业管理上没有健全的制度，特别是没有贯彻负责制和严格的产品检查制，对工人也缺乏教育，以致大量发生单纯追逐数量，忽视质量的偏向，造成废品和返工活的严重浪费。旅大广和机械工厂在今年一月份纠正忽视产品检查的偏向以前，去年十一月返工活有一一七○件，废品二八○件；十二月份返工活更增至一二五九件，废品一九四件，使生产遭受重大损失。沈阳第一机器厂因为缺乏严格的生产纪律与生产负责制，今年第一季度生产六英尺闷罐车床的计划完全落空。华中钢铁公司对于原材料没有保管，没有建立制度，很多贵重器材弃置露天，任其生锈腐蚀，其中仅据耐火砖一项损失统计，即折合大米四万石。因为生产计划不周，绘图不精确，也造成了层出不穷的费工返活的严重浪费现象。至于在生产竞赛中所产生的盲目追求数量，忽视质量，甚至损毁机器的偏向也是很普遍的。太原钢铁厂轧钢部即是一例。该厂在竞赛中，因为没有建立生产责任制和操作守则，只顾追求数量，对机器不够爱护，致中型轧制机“×形接头”扭裂，发生严重事故。据估计：至少需十二天方可修复，并将减产钢材一千五百余吨，减少收入折小米一千余万斤。与此相反，鞍钢炼铁厂由于建立了严格的交接班的制度，整顿了劳动纪律，六月份提前完成生产计划，扭转了今年前五个月没有完成生产任务的不利局面，获得东北工业部的嘉奖。
