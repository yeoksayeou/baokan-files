　　Chinese Students Advancing Under the Banner of Mao Zedong
    ——Introduction to the Delegation of Students Going Abroad——
    By our correspondent Jin Feng
    The composition of the Chinese student delegation, representing 1.6 million university and middle school students to attend the Second World Student Congress, reflects the new face of education and student movements in New China.

    Schools have begun to open their doors to workers and peasants, and hundreds of thousands of children of workers and peasants have poured into middle and primary schools. University classrooms have also begun to welcome advanced producers from factories, rural cadres, and commanders returning from the front lines. In the delegation, Li Rongchun is a participant in the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation; Jin Xiuling is a female worker from the Beijing Clothing Factory; today, they are both freshmen at the first new-type regular university in New China - the Renmin University of China.

    The liberation of mainland China marks the liberation of all ethnic groups. Fellow compatriots of minority ethnic groups, who have always suffered from the Han chauvinism of the Kuomintang reactionaries, have begun to live, work, and study equally today. Sixteen-year-old Farida in the delegation is a Hui girl from Xinjiang. When she was in Han Chinese school in the multi-ethnic Tacheng area as a child, unreasonable discrimination and persecution forced her to drop out of school after two years. Only after the liberation of Tacheng was she able to freely attend a Uyghur school in a harmonious and loving atmosphere. She said that middle and primary schools in Tacheng have now become a big family for young people of all ethnic groups. Huan Juecai Lang, a Tibetan student from Qinghai, and E'ribala, a Mongolian student from Inner Mongolia, have had similar experiences.

    Combining with workers and peasants and serving them is one of the fundamental reasons why the Chinese student movement shines brightly. The Kuomintang reactionaries once used water cannons, broadswords, barbed wire, prisons, shackles, and shameless lies to obstruct and sever this righteous combination. But Chinese students still bravely broke through these tangible and intangible blockades one by one. Dong Xuelong, a member of the delegation, was originally a student at Kunming Normal College. After the bloody suppression of the "July 15th" Kunming student movement against American imperialism's support of Japan, he recovered from his injuries and went to the countryside with his classmates to organize peasants to engage in armed struggle. In Kunyang County, 300 li away from Kunming, he and five peasants formed a gun-dragging group and seized two guns from the Kuomintang bandit army. From then on, he led and developed a guerrilla force of more than 1,000 people and 400 guns, serving as the political commissar of this guerrilla force until liberation. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government opened up a broad path for the vast number of students and young people in China to combine with workers and peasants. Li Tianxiang, a student at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and a member of the delegation, participated in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing during the winter vacation last year, helping peasants to turn over and serving them sincerely. Ding Yongning, a female student at Shanghai Aurora College of Medicine, was elected as a first-class people's meritorious worker for treating schistosomiasis japonica for soldiers of the Third Field Army this spring. She once inspected two or three hundred stool samples every day for several months, unafraid of dirt and odor. When the head of the unit and combat heroes put glory flowers on her and congratulated her, she felt that she could only receive such glory by resolutely serving the people; only by making contributions to the people is it the most glorious.

    The students of the newly liberated China are carrying out New Democratic studies with unparalleled enthusiasm. Le Daiyun and Gao Jing, members of the delegation, are two of the millions of students who excel in their studies.

　　在毛泽东旗帜下前进的中国学生
    ——出国学生代表团介绍——
    本报记者  金凤
    代表着中国一百六十万大、中学生出席世界学生第二次代表大会的中国学生代表团的组成，反映出了新中国教育和学生运动的新面貌。
    学校开始向工农开门，几十万的工农子弟涌入了中学和小学；大学的教室里也开始有着来自工厂的先进生产者，农村的干部和前线上归来的部队指挥官的位置。代表团中，李荣春是红军长征、抗日战争和解放战争的参加者，金秀玲是北京被服厂的女工；他们今天都是新中国第一所新型正规化大学——中国人民大学的本科一年级学生。
    中国大陆的解放标志着各民族的解放。一向遭受着国民党反动派大汉族主义歧视的少数民族的同胞，今天开始平等地生活、工作和学习。代表团中十六岁的法里达是一个新疆回族的少女。当她小时在多民族的塔城地区的汉族学校上学时，无理的歧视和迫害使她念了两年书便只得辍学。等到塔城解放以后，她才自由自在地在和睦、亲爱的气氛中进了维族学校。她说现在塔城的中小学校，已经成为各族青年的大家庭了。来自青海的藏族学生宦觉才郎和来自内蒙的蒙族学生额日巴拉也都有着类似的经历。
    与工农结合，为工农服务是中国学生运动发射光辉的基本原因之一。国民党反动派曾经以水龙、大刀、铁丝网、监狱、镣铐和无耻的谎言来阻挡，来割断这种正义的结合。但是中国学生依然英勇地，一个一个地冲破了这些有形无形的封锁线。代表团中的董学隆原是昆明师范学院的学生，在“七、一五”昆明学生反对美帝扶日运动遭受了血腥的镇压之后，他养好了伤就随着同学下乡去组织农民搞武装斗争。在离昆明三百里的昆阳县，他和五个农民组成了拖枪小组，夺获了国民党匪军的两条枪。从此开始，他领导发展了一千多人的游击队和四百条枪，担任了这支游击队的政治委员直到解放。解放以后，共产党和人民政府打开了中国广大学生青年与工农结合的宽广的道路。代表团中的李天祥，是中央美术学院学生，他在去年寒假参加了京郊土改，帮助着农民翻身，诚恳地为农民服务。丁永宁是上海震旦医学院的女学生，她在今年春天到部队去为三野战士医治日本吸血虫病而当选了一等人民功臣。她曾经连续几个月不怕脏、不怕臭地每天检验二、三百份大便。当部队首长、战斗英雄都为她戴上光荣花和庆贺着她时，她感到只有坚决为人民服务，才能得到这等光荣；也只有为人民立功，才是最光荣的。
    获得解放的新中国的学生正以无比的热情在进行新民主主义学习。代表团中的乐黛云和高静就是这样的学习优异的千万学生中的两个。
