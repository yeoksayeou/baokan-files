　　（I）The Significance of Basic Construction
    Basic construction is one of the important sectors of the people's economy, and its planning deserves great attention. "The construction problem, as Comrade Molotov said, has never been just an economic problem for us, but a political one. This is very obvious. The socialist tomorrow is primarily determined by the results of the construction we are undertaking today."

    Industrial basic construction is the concrete manifestation of the Soviet state's socialist industrialization. Through the construction of new factories and the reconstruction of old enterprises, the Soviet state created new production capacities in all sectors of the people's economy, ensuring the establishment of its own heavy industry base and the technical transformation of the people's economy in the shortest possible time.

    The significance of basic construction in guaranteeing the establishment of the economic foundation for building a Soviet socialist society was particularly great during the several Stalin Five-Year Plans.

    Through the planning of basic construction projects, the most important task of economic construction is determined – accelerating the improvement of the people's economy, preventing and eliminating weaknesses and partial imbalances in the development of various economic sectors, which is of great significance for the economic development of the country.

　　（II）The Content of Basic Construction
    In planning practice, the definition of basic projects is the same as that of basic construction, and its value is expressed as investment. The amount of investment is usually expressed by the amount of funds allocated for the completion of the construction program.

    Basic projects consist of the following elements:

    1. Construction engineering.

    2. Installation engineering.

    3. Procurement of machinery, equipment, tools and supplies.

    4. Design exploration, geological surveys and scientific research work.

    5. Composition of livestock and production animal herds transferred to basic assets.

    6. Expenses unrelated to the increase of basic wealth.

    7. Irrecoverable expenses for unfinished and completely abandoned basic projects.

    8. Temporary custody costs during construction.

    Construction engineering includes the construction, reconstruction, and expansion of permanent and temporary buildings and structures (blast furnaces, mines, weirs, docks, bridges, roads, etc.), and the construction of power transmission and telegraph and telephone lines. It also includes the installation of metal structural frames at construction sites, sanitary technical equipment, laying of electric lighting lines, construction of foundations and machine bases, construction of outer casings for boilers in power plants, outer casings for chemical and other industrial furnaces, site preparation, boundary preparation and construction site planning (demolition of houses, felling of trees, excavation of tree roots, removal of mounds, drainage, filling of pits, etc.), landscaping and preparation projects at construction sites, land improvement projects, and mining projects (excluding mining projects funded by existing enterprises).

    Installation engineering includes the assembly and installation of industrial, power, hoisting and transportation equipment in permanent operating enterprises and temporary enterprises, and the testing costs of the installed equipment. The installation of industrial electrical wires, which are considered part of the installed equipment, and the installation of workbenches and ladders structurally related to the equipment, as well as the insulation and painting of the installed equipment, should also be included in the overall installation engineering.

    The procurement of machinery, equipment, tools, and supplies includes all industrial, power, hoisting and transportation equipment, and various machines and lathes necessary for the operation of newly built and expanded enterprises, as well as transportation costs. In addition, transportation vehicles (locomotives, vehicles, automobiles, airplanes, tractors), agricultural machinery, laboratory, experimental factory and clinic equipment, sanitary technical equipment, and tools and supplies necessary for the normal operation of enterprises are also included.

    All equipment in basic construction should be divided into two main types: equipment requiring installation and equipment not requiring installation.

    1. Equipment requiring installation can only be utilized after its individual parts are assembled and installed on foundations or flat ground and on the support frames of buildings and structures. This equipment is included in the total amount of basic projects from the time it is taken out of the unit's warehouse and prepared for installation. Replacement equipment held in reserve also belongs to this category and is included in the total amount of basic projects after it is transferred to the operating warehouse.

    2. Equipment not requiring installation can be utilized without being installed on support frames (transportation vehicles, lathes, construction machinery, etc.). This equipment is included in the total amount of completed basic construction costs from the time it is received in the construction unit's warehouse.

    Tools and supplies with a service life of less than one year and items with a value below the prescribed limit are not included in the total amount of basic construction costs.

    Design exploration, geological surveys and scientific research work include the work of drawing up basic designs, technical designs and detailed construction drawings, as well as the costs of scientific research work and implementing exploration work; geological surveys, geodesy and topographic work, together with their laboratory research work, belong to specific construction units.

    Composition of livestock and production animal herds. This indicator includes the breeding costs of own herds, the purchase costs of herds, and the feeding costs of young animals purchased for transfer to basic assets. Under Soviet conditions, this cost is commonly used by state farms, i.e., state-owned agricultural enterprises, to purchase young animals and livestock to supplement herds, or to purchase draft animals for cultivating fields.

    Expenses unrelated to the increase of basic wealth. This category includes geological survey fees and scientific research fees that are unrelated to the construction of a specific unit but are paid for according to a special budget. The expenses of the management personnel of enterprises under construction, technical supervision fees, land consolidation fees and forest management fees allocated to various construction units from the basic construction fees also belong to this category.

    Irrecoverable expenses for unfinished and completely abandoned basic projects. This category includes expenses for abandoned basic projects (design exploration and construction engineering, etc.), as well as demolition fees and equipment dismantling fees for abandoned construction units (deducting the value of materials and equipment obtained from demolition and dismantling). The method of reimbursing such expenses should be handled in accordance with specific implementation rules.

    Temporary custody costs during construction. This item should include expenses incurred due to the temporary suspension of individual construction units or the entire construction (security personnel wages, wall covering and other work).

    The above classification of basic construction costs according to project type greatly reduces the formulation of national construction plans and provides the possibility of separate statistics for each appropriation, which is of great significance for indicating the characteristics of each type of construction.

　　（III）The Direction of Basic Construction

    In basic construction planning, in addition to classifying construction costs according to project type, the direction of construction investment is also of essential significance, as it can indicate the purpose of funds invested in construction and the nature of such construction.

    All investments in the people's economy can be divided into the following three directions: (A) new construction, (B) reconstruction, and (C) restoration.

    The above directions of investment determine the various ways of reproducing basic wealth in the people's economy.

    New construction refers to the construction projects of new buildings, enterprises, railways, highways, and other units that are newly started or renewed during the planning period.

    Reconstruction is to improve the original production capacity and expand existing enterprises. All construction costs and the cost of new equipment purchased to expand the original production capacity are included in the total amount of reconstruction.

    Restoration is to ensure the restoration of old enterprises within the scope stipulated in the approved articles of association and budget.

    However, the basic repair of houses, structures, and equipment should not be confused with "restoration." Basic repair is the cost of compensating for the degree of wear and tear of basic assets in the people's economy without expanding them.

    Basic repair costs are paid for from depreciation funds and are not included in basic project plans.

    The allocation of construction investment according to the three directions of new construction, reconstruction, and restoration varies from year to year, depending on the tasks of the national people's economy during that period. For example, during the recovery period of the Soviet people's economy (before 1926), most of the funds were invested in the restoration of enterprises, while during the period of socialist transformation, they were invested in the construction of new enterprises and the reconstruction of old enterprises.

    After the people's economy has been basically restored, new construction takes the first place, and is listed as a separate item in the national planning forms. The plan for new construction is of great significance, because it is sufficient to indicate the direction of the use of construction costs, and thereby reveal the nature of the work being carried out in the people's economy.

    It is also necessary to list new construction as an independent sector of the plan, because it can be seen from this which investment direction is dominant in the plan, and to what extent the amount of investment is concentrated in the primary construction units, and whether the amount of investment is scattered in secondary and unrelated projects. It is possible that many new construction projects have been started in previous years, but have not yet been fully utilized, while the plan stipulates many new construction units. Such a basic project plan is incorrect, and it only stagnates the funds allocated to construction.

    The correctness of the formulation of the basic project plan can also be checked by using the data on the utilization of production capacity. If it is not discovered during the planning period, although a large number of projects have been completed in the reporting year, the utilization of capacity is small, or even worse - completely unused, this indicates that the formulation of the basic construction plan is incorrect, and the funds have not been concentrated on the most important construction units. In addition, attention should also be paid to how the implementation of the project plan itself is, if its correct implementation cannot be guaranteed, then the best plan can also become ineffective.

　　（IV）Construction Installation Engineering and Its Production Characteristics

    In the basic project plan, it is of the most important significance to list construction installation engineering separately as an independent item. This indicator is extremely necessary in the national plan, because the labor plan for construction can only be calculated based on the total amount of construction installation engineering, and the needs of major building materials and installation equipment during the planning period can be calculated. Under Soviet conditions, construction installation engineering accounts for 60 to 64 percent of the total amount of basic projects.

    During the recovery period, the proportion of construction installation engineering was greatly increased, because the nature of the work was related to the demolition and repair of damaged buildings, the cleaning of metal scraps, and the restoration of damaged equipment. The largest proportion of construction installation engineering accounts for 75 to 77 percent in ferrous metallurgy enterprises, 69 to 71 percent in the coal mining industry, and 96 to 97 percent in residential construction. The proportion of construction installation engineering in the construction of machinery manufacturing enterprises fluctuates between 50 and 55 percent.

    The total amount of all construction projects should be divided into the following sectors in the plan:

    1. Industrial construction, in which the construction of industrial railways and power plants should be listed separately;

    2. Residential construction;

    3. Cultural and welfare construction, including universities, technical schools, general education schools, industrial schools, and factory practice schools;

    4. Construction of scientific research institutions;

    5. Construction of health care institutions, in which hospitals, clinics, and kindergartens should be listed separately;

    6. Public utilities construction.

    This division shows the proportion of each construction sector, and also shows the characteristics of the construction plan itself. Due to this classification, the correct contrast between the various sectors of the construction plan can be determined, and the necessary development of the above construction sectors can be guaranteed.

　　（V）The Limits of Basic Construction and Their Nomenclature

    All basic projects in the people's economy should be divided into two main types:

    A. Projects exceeding the limit,

    B. Projects below the limit.

    Projects exceeding the limit are large-scale construction projects listed as independent items in the plan according to the general name. The value of these construction projects, including all expenses stipulated in the budget of the technical design, should not be lower than the limit stipulated by the government's resolution for individual sectors of the people's economy.

    For example, projects exceeding the limit include: the ferrous metallurgy industry, with a value of more than five million rubles; the petroleum industry and non-ferrous metal mining industry, with a value of more than four million rubles; coking chemical plants and cement factories, basic chemical and rubber industries, machinery manufacturing industries, electricity industries, textile industries, sugar factories, meat manufacturing industries, with a value of more than three million rubles; the mining industry, synthetic rubber factories, dye factories, canning factories, photo-film enterprises, sewing factories, leather factories, paper factories - with a value of more than two million rubles; asbestos enterprises, roofing tile industry, brick industry, cotton processing industry, brewing industry, starch molasses industry, milling industry - with a value of more than one and a half million rubles; lime kilns, gypsum factories, tea factories, bread factories, milk factories, vegetable factories - with a value of more than one million rubles, etc.

    However, power stations, coal mines, new railway lines and trunk roads, and sea and river ports should be listed separately in the plan for projects exceeding the limit, regardless of their budget value. Large-scale construction projects should even be indicated separately in the plan according to the individual workshops and units of these construction projects.

    The main indicators of the plan for basic projects exceeding the limit should be specifically expressed in the general name table.

    The plan for projects exceeding the limit should also include residential construction carried out by existing enterprises and institutions according to an independent budget.

    Residential houses included in the total budget of enterprises or structures under construction should be expressed as a separate item in total as "residential construction" (dormitories of universities, middle schools, technical schools and other schools are not included in the residential construction plan, but should be handled according to the basic project plan of the schools under the competent department and bureau).

    The general name table of projects exceeding the limit is submitted to the government for approval along with the annual and quarterly project plans. It includes the following indicators:

    1. Name and location of construction;

    2. Year of commencement and year of completion of construction;

    3. Production capacity of the enterprise;

    4. Budget value of the construction unit;

    5. Amount of work completed up to January 1 of the planned year;

    6. Total of basic projects according to budget value, including:

    A. Expected completion in the total amount of basic projects in the previous year,

    B. Utilization of production capacity calculated in equivalent units,

    C. Utilized basic assets, unit: rubles,

    7. Plan for the coming year:

    A. Total amount of work according to budget value,

    B. Utilized production capacity calculated in equivalent units,

    C. Utilized basic assets, unit: rubles,

    D. Period of commencement of utilization,

    8. Which institution approved the technical documents and when;

    9. Name of the institution executing the construction.

    Only item 7 is finally approved by the government, and the remaining indicators are submitted as reference materials.

    Projects below the limit are those whose budget value is lower than the limit prescribed for projects exceeding the limit. The cost of purchasing equipment, automobiles, and furniture required by existing and under-construction enterprises also belongs to this category.

    In the national plan for basic projects, projects below the limit are only expressed in total amount, and then the departments notify the local areas individually for implementation.

　　（VI）Technical Documents for Basic Construction

    In the Soviet Union's basic construction plan, great attention is paid to the guarantee of technical documents for construction.

    According to the decision of the Soviet government, only projects with plans and budgets that have been approved before the start of the planning period should be included in the general name table of projects exceeding the limit submitted to the government for approval. The project budget is the basic document for determining the value of construction, it is the basis of economic accounting, and it indicates the amount of expenses for various types of projects.

    If there are individual important projects for which there are no plans and budgets, but which must be built and completed quickly, then exceptions can be made, and individual types of projects can be evaluated and funds allocated in advance. However, this situation requires special permission from the government, and such permission has always been granted based on the request of the competent department or bureau, with the prior opinion of the Soviet State Planning Committee.

    The remaining projects without plans and budgets are not included in the national plan, and banks are not allowed to allocate funds to them. Large-scale project plans and budgets should be approved by the government, and all other projects should be approved by departments and central bureaus.

    For local projects belonging to local industry, industrial cooperatives, and other local economic sectors, the plans and budgets are approved by local organs (the Councils of Ministers of the member republics, the Soviets of Workers' Deputies of the border regions and states, or the competent economic organs entrusted by them).

    The three issues of design and economic basis, as well as preparatory work before construction, are given the greatest attention in the Soviet Union. Well-arranged projects and budgets, timely technical and economic exploration, and preparation for construction installation work on the site can make the expenditure of state funds reasonable and ensure the most economical construction.

    Construction plans are mainly divided into three stages:

    A. Basic design or planning task,

    B. Technical design,

    C. Detailed working drawings.

    The basic design should be formulated based on the results of extensive surveys specifically conducted for the construction. This includes the selection of land for industrial and residential construction, the determination of the types of products produced by the new enterprise, its production capacity, the production links with other enterprises (cooperatives), the supply of raw materials, fuel, and electricity, the supply of transportation, the enterprise's plan for utilizing its full production capacity, the composition of the enterprise's workshops, the types of main houses and structures, the order of construction, the overall value of the construction, and other conditions related to the construction and future operation of the enterprise.

    The technical design should be formulated based on the basic design, and it is the main document for solving basic technical problems, stipulating the technical and economic indicators of the planned enterprise, and determining its budget value.

    The technical design should include the following main data and figures: the overall plan of the enterprise, various data on the calculation of the production program, transportation data, calculations on steam power, fuel supply, water supply, sewerage, ventilation, and raw material and material supply, calculations on cadres and their distribution and use, data and calculations on the houses and structures of the planned enterprise, and data explaining the organization of construction projects on the site.

    The detailed working drawings should be made based on the approved technical design and the technical data obtained on the ordering of machinery and equipment. When making detailed working drawings, it is forbidden to violate the approved technical design.

　　（VII）Utilization of Production Capacity

    The index of utilization of newly built, rebuilt, and restored enterprises is the most important index of the basic construction plan. The amount of utilization determines the increase in capacity and basic assets in the people's economy and creates the necessary conditions for improving social production.

    The amount of utilization is planned according to the corresponding sectors of the people's economy in terms of value and quantity. Basic assets are the value representation of the capacity that has begun to be utilized. In the general name table, they are indicated in a separate column as "utilized basic assets."

    A list of the amount of utilization expressed in physical quantities by various planning departments should list the most important types of production separately according to the peculiarities of each department. For example, in heavy industry, the most significant indicators are the following:

    Ferrous metallurgy - the number of blast furnaces and Martin furnaces put into operation and the capacity of steel smelting, the number of electric furnaces and the capacity of electric steelmaking, the total number of steel rolling mills and the capacity of steel rolling, the number of coking furnaces and their total capacity, the capacity of mines for mining, etc.;

    Power stations - the equipment capacity of thermal and hydroelectric power stations put into operation, the boiler capacity of thermal power plants;

    Coal mining industry - the number of mines put into operation and their total capacity, the number of concentrators and their capacity, as well as other indicators showing the capacity of newly utilized combined units.

    The capacity of various types of production should be determined on the basis of annual, quarterly, monthly, or daily periods, and should be indicated in the planning forms.

    These indicators of utilization capacity should be listed in the individual sectors of the people's economy on the basis of the actual amount of production equipment and equipment.

    The interrelationship between the amount of utilization of production capacity prescribed in the people's economy plan and the total amount of basic construction is of utmost importance. In the first Stalin Five-Year Plan, the ratio of the utilization of industrial basic assets to the total amount of completed construction was 62.8 percent, the second Five-Year Plan was 90.4 percent, and the utilization amount stipulated in the third Five-Year Plan reached 100 percent. In the post-war Five-Year Plan, the ratio of the utilization amount of basic assets to the total amount of basic construction was 93.6 percent.

    In order to guarantee the utilization of production capacity, it is necessary to stipulate in the plans for basic construction of various departments the method of concentrating funds on the most important start-up units, so as to avoid dispersing funds, equipment, and materials to secondary units, and concentrate them in places where new production capacity can be utilized in a very short period of time, so as to start production for the people's economy.

    If the scale of the enterprise under construction is planned correctly and meets the requirements of the industrial technical process, then the construction period can be accelerated and the start-up unit can be guaranteed to be utilized. When planning, it is necessary to fight against the preference for large-scale construction, because their utilization often takes many years.

    Even from the perspective of operation, the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises is also beneficial, because their supply of raw materials and fuel, electricity and water is obviously easier than that of large enterprises.

    In the Soviet Union, great importance is attached to the completion of capacity utilization plans. Since 1947, the government has stipulated a new system of awarding bonuses for exceeding the completion of the national basic construction plan, under which the award of bonuses must be combined with the completion of a corresponding production capacity utilization plan (housing, production sites, equipment, etc.).

    Guaranteeing the necessary reserve of production capacity for the normal development of the people's economy is one of the most important tasks when compiling the capacity utilization plan, especially for those departments that should constantly create a reserve of production capacity, such as the fuel industry, power stations, machinery manufacturing, and railway transportation. This is especially important because the development of all other sectors of the people's economy depends greatly on them.

　　（VIII）Construction Supply and Fiscal Allocation Plan

    In addition to the above main items of the basic construction plan, the following important parts should also be included in the composition of the plan:

    1. Labor and wage plan,

    2. Material and technical supply plan,

    3. Cost and financial plan.

    The compilation of these planning items should be based on the general instructions passed by the government when formulating the entire national plan for the development of the people's economy in the future planning period.

    The total amount of construction installation engineering planned on the basis of the actual total amount of projects in each sector of the people's economy is usually used as the basis for calculating the production quota required for construction. The number of employees in construction installation engineering and affiliated enterprises should be calculated separately according to each category of workers: workers, engineering technicians, staff, etc.

    The planned wage fund should be stipulated on the basis of the total number of employees engaged in production and the average wage of each category of workers.

    The material and technical supply plan is also based on the total amount of construction installation engineering. The necessary building materials should be calculated by the departments and bureaus separately for each economic sector, according to the combined average standard, and especially important construction projects should be calculated in accordance with the technical design and budget approved by each construction unit. If there is no approved design, the materials for large-scale enterprises should be calculated according to the preliminary estimate and basic design. Therefore, the needs of building materials and equipment for basic construction must strictly conform to the total amount of basic construction in each economic sector. At the same time, the basic construction plan should also be closely linked to the possibility of allocating all necessary materials and equipment for the purpose of construction, so that these materials and equipment can be separated for construction purposes, and no direct losses occur to the original enterprises.

    The construction fiscal allocation plan consists of the following two parts:

    1. Construction costs (including three months of material reserves),

    2. Sources of funds to cover construction costs.

    Appropriations from the state budget are the main source of fiscal allocation.

    Investment by economic organs themselves from depreciation and profit items is the second source of fiscal allocation.

    In addition, funds stipulated in the financial plans of economic organs, as well as extra-plan accumulations and the mobilization of internal resources, can be used as supplementary sources of fiscal allocation.

    In China's current situation, it does not seem necessary to distinguish the reimbursement items in such detail, and it is more appropriate for all construction costs to be passed through the budget.

    During the construction process, fiscal allocation is implemented in accordance with the approved technical, industrial, and financial plan for the construction project, and is handled on the spot by the Industrial Bank and its branches (or sub-branches).

    The plan to reduce construction costs is proposed by various departments, comparing the percentages of various construction units for past planning periods. It is calculated according to each factor of construction installation engineering per unit, and its value is the sum of direct costs and additional costs.

    Direct costs include: the value of materials and equipment, the main wages of workers, the expenditure on the mechanization of engineering, auxiliary economic undertakings and external supplies (steam, electricity, water, earthwork, transportation, etc.).

    Additional costs include: administrative expenses, supplementary wages and allowances for workers, utility expenses, construction security expenses, travel expenses, expenses for materials, the structure of the building and the experimental fees for various parts, and various other expenses that are not directly related to the direct construction of construction and installation projects on the site.

　　（IX）Total Amount and Sector Structure of Basic Construction

    The total amount of basic construction in the people's economy and its distribution in various sectors and regions of the country should be determined according to the current tasks of the country during a certain period.

    As we all know, the famous several Stalin Five-Year Plans are the manifestation of the industrialization policy implemented by the Bolshevik Party in the past fifteen to twenty years. According to this plan, most of the funds are used for the construction plans of industrial enterprises.

    The planned total amount of construction projects and its distribution among various sectors of the people's economy is not blind or laissez-faire, but is strictly considered and conforms to the policies of the government and the Party in building a new society during a certain historical period.

    Although the Soviet state still maintains certain trade and economic relations with capitalist countries, it is building a new communist society completely independent of capitalism.

    To this end, the Soviet government first established a large-scale heavy industry, relying on which it carried out the thorough transformation of all other sectors of the people's economy.

    The amount of funds allocated to basic construction during the planning period is determined by the following main factors:

    The first is determined by the possibilities of the state budget, which is compiled simultaneously with the people's economy plan. If there are necessary reserves in the budget, and the government believes that accelerating the construction of individual departments and units is a matter of urgency, so that their creation will help solve the general economic tasks currently facing the country, then this possibility will be further expanded.

    The second most important factor determining national basic construction is the possibility of allocating the necessary building materials and equipment produced domestically and purchased from abroad for the purpose of construction.

    The total amount of construction and installation projects in various planning periods, under the budgetary conditions in individual years, may be greatly increased, but the shortage of the most necessary building materials, especially equipment, is also sufficient to hinder this. Therefore, special attention should be paid to this when compiling the basic construction plan.

    The third factor that determines the size of the basic construction plan is the labor force (especially skilled workers) necessary to complete the planned construction installation projects.

    In order to accurately estimate the above two situations when compiling the basic construction plan, it is necessary to prepare in advance a balance sheet of national building materials, equipment, and labor force, which should not only take into account the needs of construction, but also the needs of operation, that is, the constant needs of all other sectors of the national economy in terms of building materials, equipment, and labor force.

    The fourth factor that determines the total amount of basic construction is the condition of the technical documents, that is, the well-prepared designs and budgets for the new, rebuilt, or restored units in each sector. This is especially important for the largest-scale construction projects that require a large amount of financial funds, building materials, equipment, and labor force to implement construction.

    Taking into account these main factors, the total amount of national basic construction can be determined, and the estimated amount (limit) of investment in the main sectors of the people's economy can be stipulated.

    This stage of determining the total amount of investment is called the formulation of limits for various sectors of the people's economy, and it is a very important stage in the basic construction plan. It can carefully explain the total amount of necessary expenses for each sector of the people's economy, and avoid unnecessary extravagance and waste in the construction program. After the investment limits for each sector have been stipulated, the basic construction plan can be practically implemented in the specific designs of various departments and bureaus.

    In the Soviet Union, the limits of basic construction are jointly formulated by the Soviet State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Finance in the initial stage of planning work. Usually, the annual limits should be formulated in July and August, and the longer-term limits (Five-Year Plan) should be formulated at the beginning of this work, regardless of the calendar period.

    The draft annual limits of the basic construction plan proposed by the State Planning Committee must be reviewed and approved by the government in advance, and then this limit is sent to various departments and bureaus for distribution to individual enterprises and construction units. In the next stage, that is, when reviewing and approving the draft people's economy plan formulated by the departments, bureaus, and the State Planning Committee, there may also be partial revisions to the approved limits, because when reviewing the draft plan in detail, omissions of individual construction projects will be found. This revision can make the basic construction plan more realistic and practically completed.

　　（X）Distribution of Basic Construction in Various Regions of the Country

    Guaranteeing the correct distribution of productivity in the country is also an important item of the basic construction plan. In the era of old Russia, the distribution of productivity was deformed, and industry was concentrated in the central regions: Donbass, Ural Mountains, Baku, and St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), while the remaining regions did not have advanced large-scale industry.

    The Soviet state implemented a correct policy of average industrial distribution, making it close to the sources of raw materials, fuel, electricity, and consumption areas, thus ensuring the reduction of unreasonable and long-distance transportation, ensuring the cultural and economic improvement of the backward national republics and regions in the country, and consolidating national defense capabilities.

    The guarantee of the correct distribution of domestic productivity must be realized through the basic construction plan compiled according to the decisions of the above-mentioned main economic tasks of the Soviet state.

    After determining the total amount of basic construction in various departments and enterprises, a comprehensive table should be made by region, which can determine the interrelationship of the development of individual regions, and explain the degree of concentration of construction projects in individual cities, states, and republics.

　　（XI）Inspection of Completion of Basic Construction Plan

    The basic construction plan and the plans of other sectors of the people's economy do not end with the completion of the plan, but continue to supervise and inspect the completion of the plan. The organization and inspection of the completion of the basic construction plan is of extreme importance to the people's economy.

    In the inspection process, the extent to which the departments, enterprises, and regions have completed the plan should be ascertained, the shortcomings of individual units in the process of executing the construction installation project should be revealed, assistance should be provided to the construction organs, efforts should be made to eliminate the shortcomings found in the inspection, and supplementary resources and reserves should be explored to seek the over-completion of the plan.

    The correctly established inspection of the completion of the plan should not only discover the shortcomings existing in the construction project, and find out the deviations in the development and guarantee of the construction project, but also prevent these deviations, and foresee the difficulties that will inevitably occur in the completion of the construction program.

    In the Soviet Union, the inspection of the completion of the plan is actively carried out, in particular, the planning organs and statistical organs are responsible for leading this work separately.

    The Soviet State Planning Committee, within three to five days after the government approves the plan, checks whether the departments and bureaus have sent the plan to the various enterprises. In the inspection process, it should be judged whether the basic engineering plan formulated by the departments for each construction project is correct, whether this plan conforms to the national plan, and the extent to which the funds, labor force, building materials, and other materials allocated to the departments are correctly distributed to the enterprises.

    In the following inspection process, it should also be judged the completion of the project plan itself, the total amount of its actual fiscal allocation, the completion of the production capacity utilization plan, the dynamics of unfinished projects, the completion of the residential construction plan, the guarantee of construction materials, labor force, charts, the utilization of machinery and other issues.

    Investigation and statistics are of great significance in the inspection of the completion of the basic construction plan. Without these two, strict design and supervision of the completion of the plan are unimaginable. The data from periodic statistics and regular surveys can guarantee the necessary materials, equipment, labor force, and construction machinery for construction, and find out the completion of the plan in terms of cost, financial indicators, and other aspects.

    In construction, the correctly established inspection of the completion of the plan is the guarantee of good work organization, the expression of a high culture in managing construction undertakings, and a loyal assistant in leading and ensuring the completion of the national construction program.

　　（XII）Construction Industry

    In the Soviet Union, special attention is paid to the development of the construction industry, that is, the methods and technology of implementing construction projects.

    Previous construction was carried out by handcraft, without the use of necessary machines and equipment. There were no specialized construction worker cadres, and the production of building materials was backward.

    Now there are specialized construction worker cadres, a large number of construction machines and equipment are used, and construction is carried out by industrialized methods.

    In order to realize a large-scale construction program, specialized departments and contracting organs have been established in the country, and their task is to complete the construction installation projects stipulated in the plan in accordance with the contract signed with the client.

    The relationship between the contracting construction organs and the clients, that is, the organs for which they are building, is handled by a special resolution on the contracting contract issued by the government. The client and the contractor sign a construction contracting contract based on this resolution, and this construction must be included in the general name table approved by the government. The contractor is responsible to the client for the completion of the entire project, whether it is completed directly by himself or indirectly completed by subcontracting to a subcontractor. The contractor shall be responsible for completing the project as scheduled, in accordance with the technical design and budget and working drawings delivered by the client, in accordance with the contract provisions.

    The fund for building materials should be paid directly to the contractor in accordance with the quantity and period of completion of the construction project.

    The client is the fund controller and the main supervisor of the quality and period of the project carried out by the contractor. He pays the fund for the materials needed for the construction unit to the contractor, and this fund is to ensure all the materials in the design and the payment for the completed project. For the daily supervision of the quality of construction projects and the period of utilization of production capacity, the client should establish a small administrative agency of the future enterprise from the time the construction starts, which issues working blueprints to the contractor, transports equipment to the construction site and helps with the construction project. This agency also manages the acceptance of the finished units handed over by the contractor at any time during construction.

    The client is the administrator of all funds and funds allocated for construction. The branch of the Industrial Bank in the construction area pays the contractor the project cost specified in the technical design and budget. Payment can only be made after this project cost has been accepted by the client.

    The contractor has the right to receive a portion of the funds transferred to the construction, in order to spend on the purchase of machinery, transportation, and construction equipment required for the construction. In the budget, these funds should be separated into a special item, the so-called third part of the budget.

    The contracting method of construction is widely used in the Soviet Union. There are now two large contracting departments: the Heavy Industry Enterprise Construction Department and the Navy Enterprise Construction Department, which have huge project fronts.

    In addition, specialized contracting departments for residential construction and civil engineering and huge all-republic construction trusts have been established in many member republics to carry out large construction projects. Special establishment is the Urban Construction Department, Stalingrad

　　苏联基本建设计划的实践
    苏良彬
        （一）基本建设的意义
    基本建设是人民经济的重要部门之一，它的计划也就值得非常的注意。“建设问题，莫洛托夫同志说——在我们这里从来不仅是经济问题，而且是政治问题。这是很明显的。社会主义的明日，首先决定于我们今日所进行的建设成果。”
    工业的基本建设是苏维埃国家社会主义工业化的具体表现。通过新工厂的建设和旧企业的改建，苏维埃国家在人民经济的一切部门之中创造了新的生产能力，保证了在最短期间内创建起自己的重工业基础和完成人民经济的技术改造。
    基本建设的意义，在保证经济基础的建立，以建设苏维埃社会主义社会的几次斯大林五年计划诸年中，是特别地伟大的。
    通过基本建设工程的计划，决定了经济建设的最重要的任务——加速人民经济的提高，预防和消除经济各个部门发展中的弱点和局部的不均衡，这对于国家的经济发展是具有极大的意义的。
            （二）基本建设的内容
    在计划的实践上，基本工程的定义与基本建设相同，而它的价值表示则为投资。投资额通常是以预定完成建设大纲所拨的资金数额来表示的。
    基本工程由下列的要素组成：
    １、建筑工程。
    ２、按装工程。
    ３、机器设备、工具和用品的购置。
    ４、设计探勘、地质调查和科学研究的工作。
    ５、转入基本财产的役畜与生产畜畜群的组成。
    ６、与增殖基本财富无关的费用。
    ７、关于未完成和彻底废止的基本工程不可收回的费用。
    ８、建设的临时保管费用。
    建筑工程是：永久和临时建筑物及营造物（熔矿炉、矿井、堰堤、码头、桥梁、道路等）的兴建、改建和扩充的工程，送电和电报电话线路的修建工程。此外还包括建筑现场金属结构架的装设，卫生技术设备、敷设电灯线的工程，地基和机器底座的建筑，发电厂锅炉外衣，化工及其他工业作业炉外衣的砌造，建筑地段的整理，境界的准备和建筑场的计划工作（房屋的拆除、树林的砍伐、树根的挖掘，土丘的铲除、排水、填坑等），建筑场的绿化工程及整备工程，土地改良工程，矿山工程（由原有的企业经费项下开支的矿山工程除外）。
    按装工程是：在永久经营的企业及临时企业中的工业，动力、起重运输设备的装配和按设工程，所装设备的试验费也包括在内。在按装工程的总体内，还应该列入算作所装设备成分之一的工业电线的装置，在结构上与设备相关联的作业台和梯子的设置，所装设备的绝缘及油饰。
    机器设备、工具和用品的购置，包括一切有关新建的和扩充的企业为经营所必需的工业、动力、起重运输设备和各种机器和车床的购置与运输费用。此外，运输工具（机车、车辆、汽车、飞机、拖拉机），农业机器、化验室、试验工厂和诊疗室的设备，卫生技术设备和企业正常工作所必需的工具及用品的购置费，也包括在内。
    基本建设中的一切设备、应分为两个主要的类型：需要按装的设备，和无需按装的设备。
    １、需要按装的设备，只有在将其个别部分配合起来，而按装在基础上或平地上和建筑物与营造物的支持架上之后，才能开始利用；这种设备，是从本单位仓库中提出而准备按装之时起，始列入基本工程总量。作为备用的替换设备也属于此项，在将其移交营业仓库之后，即列入基本工程总量内。
    ２、无需按装的设备，不必按装在支持架上即可利用（运输工具、车床、建筑机械等）。这种设备，在建设单位的仓库收到之时起，即列入已完成的基本建设费总额。
    使用期限在一年以下的工具和用品及价值低于规定限度的物品，不列入基本建设费总额内。
    设计探勘、地质调查和科学研究的工作，包括基本设计，技术设计和施工详图的绘制工作，以及科学研究工作和实行探勘工作的费用；地质调查，测地学和地形学的工作，连同其化验研究的工作在内，是属于具体的建设单位的。
    役畜和生产畜畜群的组成。在这个指标之下，包括自有畜群的繁殖费，畜群的购置费和转入基本财产所购幼畜的饲养费。在苏维埃的条件之下，这种费用是常用于国营农场的，即国营的农业企业购买幼畜和大畜用以补充畜群，或购买役畜用于田地的耕作。
    与增殖基本财富无关的费用。属于此项费用的，是无关一定单位的建设，而按照特别预算开支的地质调查费和科学研究费。正在建设中的企业的管理人员经费，技术监督费，由基本建设费项下开支而分配于各建设单位的土地整理费和森林经营费，也属于此项费用之内。
    关于未完成和彻底废止的基本工程不可收回的费用。属于此项费用的，是关于废止的基本工程（设计探勘和建筑工程等）的费用，以及废止的建设单位的拆除费及设备拆卸费（扣除因拆除及拆卸所获得的材料和设备的价值）。这种费用的报销办法，应依照特定的施行细则办理。
    建设的临时保管费用。这一项内应列入因个别建设单位或整个建设的临时中止而连带发生的费用（警卫人员的工资，墙壁的掩蔽和其他工作）。
    上述基本建设费之按照工程种类的分类，大大地减轻了国家建设计划的制定，并且提供对于每项拨款予以单独统计的可能，这个对于表明每种建设的特性是具有重要意义的。
            （三）基本建设的方向
    在基本建设计划上，除建设费按照工程种类予以分类之外，还有建设投资的方向，也具有本质的意义，它可以表明资金投入建设中的目的何在，这种建设的性质如何。
    人民经济中的一切投资，可分为下列的三个方向：（甲）新建、（乙）改建、（丙）恢复。
    上述投资的方向，决定着人民经济中基本财富再生产的各种方式。
    新的建设，是在本计划期内新开始的或从新续修的新建筑物，企业、铁路、公路和其他单位的建设工程。
    改建是提高原来生产能力和扩充现有企业。凡是建设费，以及为了扩大原来生产能力所购置的新设备费，都属于改建的总额以内。
    恢复是保证旧有的企业，在批准的章程和预算所规定的范围以内的恢复工程。
    但是房屋、营造物和设备的基本修理，不可与“恢复”混为一谈。所谓基本修理、乃是不扩大基本财产，而仅补偿其在人民经济中损耗程度的费用。
    基本修理费，是由折旧金项下开支，不列入基本工程计划以内。
    建设投资，按新建、改建、恢复三个方向的分配，是各年不同的，乃是看全国人民经济在该时期内的任务如何而定。例如，在苏联人民经济的恢复时期（一九二六年以前），大部分资金投于企业的恢复，到了社会主义改造时期，则投入于新企业的建设和旧企业的改建。
    等到人民经济在基本上恢复之后，新建即居于首位，在国家计划的表格上也以独立项目分别列出。新建设的计划是有重要意义的，因为它足以表明建设费运用的方向，并且以此揭出人民经济中进行工作的性质。
    需要把新建设列为计划的独立部门，也是因为借此可以看出何种投资方向在计划内是占优势的，投资额向首要的兴建单位集中的程度如何，有没有把投资额分散于次要的和无大关系的工程上去。可能有这种情形，前几年已开始了许多新的建设，至今尚未完全利用，而在计划里却又规定出许多新的建设单位。这样的基本工程计划是不正确的，它只有把拨用到建设上的资金停滞起来。
    基本工程计划制定的正确性，还可以用生产能力利用的资料来检查。如果在计划期未发现出来，虽然在报告年度中完成了大量的工程，而能力的利用却为数不多，或是更坏——完全没有利用，这就说明基本建设计划制定的不正确，没有把资金集中到最重要的兴建单位上去。此外，还应该注意工程计划本身的执行如何，如果不能保证它的正确执行，则最好的计划也可以变成效果不大的。
            （四）建筑按装工程和它的生产特征
    在基本工程计划上，具有最重要意义的，是以独立目项分别列出的建筑按装工程。这个指标在国家计划上是极端需要的，因为根据建筑按装工程的总量，方能计算出建设上的劳动计划，计划期内主要建筑材料和按装用设备的需要量。在苏联的条件之下，建筑按装工程在基本工程总量中占百分之六○至六四。
    在恢复时期，建筑按装工程的比重大大地提高，因为工作的性质，有关于被破坏的建筑物的拆除和修缮，金属碎片的清理和损坏的设备的恢复。建筑按装工程的最大比重，在黑色金属冶金企业上占百分之七五至七七，在煤矿工业上占百分之六九至七一，在住宅建设上占百分之九六至九七。在机器制造企业的建设上建筑按装工程的比重，则动摇于百分之五○至五五之间。
    建设工程全部的总量，在计划上应分为上列部门：
    １、工业建设，其中工业铁路和发电厂的建设应分别列出；
    ２、住宅建设；
    ３、文化福利建设，其中包括高等学校、技术学校、普通教育学校、工业学校、工厂实习学校；
    ４、科学研究机关的建设；
    ５、保健机关的建设，其中医院，诊疗所及幼稚园应分别列出；
    ６、公用事业建设。
    这种划分表示出每一建设部门的比重，同时也显示出建设计划本身的特性。由于这样的分类，才可以确定建设计划上各部门之间正确的对比，并保证上列各建设部门的必要发展。
            （五）基本建设的限度及其名称表示
    在人民经济上的所有基本工程，应分为两个主要类型：
    甲，超限额的工程，
    乙，低于限额的工程。
    属于超限额工程的，是在计划内按照总名称表以独立项目列出的大规模的建设。这些建设的价值，连同技术设计的预算所规定的一切费用在内，应该不低于政府决议对于人民经济个别部门所规定的限定额。
    例如，属于超限额工程的，黑色金属冶金业，其价值在五百万卢布以上者；石油工业和有色金属矿业，在四百万卢布以上者；炼焦化学工厂和水泥工厂、基本化学和橡胶工业、机器制造业、电业、纺织业、制糖工厂、肉类制造业，三百万卢布以上者；采矿业、合成树胶工厂、染料工厂、罐头工厂、照像电影企业、缝纫工厂、皮革工厂、制纸工厂——在二百万卢布以上者；石绵企业、屋顶瓦业、砖窑业、棉花加工业、酿酒业、淀粉糖蜜业、制粉业——在一百五十万卢布以上者；石灰窑、石膏工厂、茶叶工厂、面包工厂、牛奶工厂、菜蔬工厂——在一百万卢布以上者等。
    但电站，煤矿，新铁路线和汽车路干线，海河港口，无论其预算价值若干，都应分别列入超限额的工程计划内。大规模的建设，甚至还要按照这些建设的个别车间和单位，在计划内分别表示。
    超限额的基本工程计划的主要指标，应在总名称表内具体表示出来。
    在超限额的建设计划里，还应列入现有企业和机关按照独立预算所进行的住宅建设。
    列入正在建设中的企业或营造物总预算中的住宅房屋，应以独立项目总和地表示为“住宅建设”（高等学校，中学，技术学校和其他学校的宿舍，不列入住宅建设计划，而应按该管部，署的学校基本工程计划办理）。
    超限额建设的总名称表，是随着年度及季度工程计划提请政府批准的。它包括有以下的指标：
    １、建设的名称和地点；
    ２、建设的开始年度和完成年度；
    ３、企业的生产能力；
    ４、建设单位的预算价值；
    ５、截至计划年度一月一日止工程的完成量；
    ６、按照预算价值基本工程总量的合计，其中包括：
    甲，上年度基本工程总量中预计的完成量，
    乙，按相当的单位计算的生产能力的利用，
    丙，已利用的基本财产，单位卢布，
    ７、来年度计划：
    甲，按照预算价值的工程总量，
    乙，按相当的单位计算的已利用的生产能力。
    丙，已利用的基本财产，单位卢布，
    丁，开始利用的期间，
    ８、技术文据经何机关于何时批准；
    ９、执行建设的机关名称。
    政府最后批准的，仅从第七项起，其余的指标，是作为参考资料而提出的。
    属于低限额工程的，是其预算价值低于为超限度工程所规定的限额的建设。至于现有和在建设中的企业所需要的设备，汽车和家具的购置费，也属于此项。
    在基本工程的国家计划里，低限额的建设仅以总额表示，然后由部方分别个别名称通知当地去执行。
            （六）基本建设的技术文件
    在苏联的基本工程计划上，非常注意技术文件对于建设的保证。
    按照苏维埃政府的决定，在提请政府批准的超限额工程总名称表内，仅应列入计划时期开始之前已经批准的计划和预算的工程。工程预算，是决定建设价值的基本文件，它是经济核算的基础，并且表示用于各类工程的费用数额。
    如遇有个别重要工程尚无计划和预算，但必需建设而且须迅速地完成的情形时，则可例外处理，许可对于个别种类的工程单独估价先行拨款。但是这种情形需要政府特别许可，而这种许可向来是根据该管部、署的请求，由苏联国家计划委员会预先加具意见而发给的。
    其余的没有计划和预算的工程，概不列入国家计划之内，也不准许银行向其拨款。  大规模的工程计划和预算应由政府批准，其余一切工程，则由部及中央局署批准。
    属于地方工业、工业合作社和其他地方经济部门的地方性工程，其计划和预算由地方机关（各盟员共和国部长会议，边区和州劳动人民代表苏维埃，或受其委任的该管经济机关）批准。
    对于设计和经济基础，以及建设前准备工作的三个问题，在苏联都予以最大的注意。在设计预算上布置完善的事业，及时进行的技术经济勘查和现场上进行建筑按装工作的准备，都能使得国家资金开支合理并保证建设最经济的进行。
    建设计划主要分为三个阶段：
    甲，基本设计或计划任务，
    乙，技术设计，
    丙，工作详图。
    基本设计，应根据对该建设专门进行的广泛勘查结果而制定。这里面包括工业及住宅建设用地的选定，新建企业生产品类的确定，它的生产能力，与其他企业之间的生产联系（合作社），原料、燃料、电力的供给，运输的供应，企业发展到全部生产能力的利用计划，企业车间的组成，主要房屋及营造物的类型，建设的次序，建设的概括价值，与建设和将来企业经营有关的其他条件。
    技术设计，应根据基本设计而制定，它是解决基本技术问题，规定所计划企业的技术经济指标，确定其预算价值的主要文件。
    技术设计应该包括下列的主要资料和数字：企业的总计划，关于生产大纲计算的各种资料，运输资料，关于汽力发动、燃料供给、给水、下水道、通风、原料和材料供给的计算，关于干部的计算及其配布和使用，关于所计划企业的房屋和营造物的资料和计算，说明现场建设工程组织的资料。
    工作详图应根据批准的技术设计和关于定购机器设备所得到的技术资料来制作。当制作工作详图时，禁止违背批准的技术设计。
            （七）生产能力的利用
    新建、改建和恢复的企业之利用量指标，是基本建设计划最重要的指标。利用量决定着人民经济中能力与基本财产的增加和创造着提高社会生产的必要条件。
    利用量是按人民经济的相当部门用值与量的表示来计划的。基本财产就是已开始利用的能力的价值表示。在总名称表内，它们以“利用的基本财产”单独的一栏来表明。
    各计划部门以实物量表示的利用量一览表，应分别各部的特殊性列出最重要的生产种类。例如，在重工业中，最显著的指标有下列的几项：
    黑色冶金业——熔矿炉和马丁炉开始利用的数量和钢铁冶炼的能力，电炉的数量和炼电钢的能力，轧钢车床的总数和轧钢的能力，炼焦炉的数量及其总能力，矿山采矿的能力等等；
    电站——开始利用的火力和水力电站的设备能力，火力发电厂的锅炉能力；
    煤矿工业——矿坑开始利用的数量及其总能力，选矿厂的数量及其能力，以及其他各种表明新利用的复合机组能力的指标。
    各种生产的能力应以年度、季度、一个月或一昼夜的期间为标准来确定，并且在计划表格内指出。
    利用能力的这类指标，应依据生产用具与设备的实际量，在人民经济计划的个别部门之中列出。
    在人民经济计划中所规定的生产能力的利用量与基本建设总量之间的相互关系具有极其重要的意义。在第一次斯大林五年计划中，工业基本财产的利用对于完成建设的总量之比，计为百分之六二·八，第二次五年计划为百分之九○·四，而第三次五年计划所规定的利用量就达到了百分之百。在战后五年计划中，基本财产的利用量对于基本建设的总量之比，计为百分之九三·六。
    为了保证生产能力的利用，必须在各部基本建设的计划中规定集中资金到最重要的开动的事业单位上去的办法，以免资金、设备和材料分散在次要的单位上，而把它们集中于可能在很短期间内利用的新生产能力的地方，以便为人民经济开始生产。
    如果建设的企业规模计划得正确，符合工业技术过程的要求，那末建设的期限就可能加速，开动的事业单位也可以保证利用。在计划时必须向庞大建设的偏好作斗争，因为它们的利用往往要延长到好多年。
    即使从经营方面来看，中小企业的建设也是有利的，因为它们的原料和燃料，电力和水的供给显然是比大企业容易。
    在苏联对于能力利用计划的完成是极其重视的。自一九四七年起，政府规定了对国家基本建设计划的超过完成发给奖金的新制度，在这种制度之下，奖金的颁发必须是与建设计划同时还要完成相当的生产能力的利用计划（住宅、生产场所，设备等等）。
    保证创造生产能力的必要后备力量，以求人民经济的正常发展，这是编制能力利用计划时最主要的任务之一，特别是那些应当不断地创造生产后备能力的部门，例如燃料工业、电力站、机器制造、铁路运输等，这一点尤其重要，因为其他一切人民经济部门的发展要大大地依赖它们。
            （八）建设的供应与财政拨付计划
    除上述的基本建设计划主要项目之外，在计划的成份中还应列入以下的几个重要部分：
    １、劳动与工资计划，
    ２、物资技术的供应计划，
    ３、成本与财政计划。
    编制这些计划项目，应根据政府在制定未来计划时期人民经济发展的整个国家计划时所通过的总指示。
    以人民经济每一部门的工程实际总量为标准所计划出来的建筑按装工程总量，通常是作为计算建设所需的生产员额的基础。其中建筑按装工程与附属企业的职工数目，应按劳动者的每一类别分别计算：工人、工程技术人员、职员等等。
    计划的工资基金，应以从事生产的总员额和劳动者每一范畴的平均工资为标准而规定之。
    物资技术供应计划也是建立在建筑按装工程总量的基础上。必要的建筑材料，应由各部、署分别各个经济部门，根据合并的平均标准，而个别特殊重要的建设，更应符合于各该建设单位所批准的技术设计与预算进行计算。如无批准之设计，则大规模企业之材料应根据预先概算的计算书与基本设计而计算之。因此，基本建设的建筑材料与设备的需要量，必须严格地符合每个经济部门的基本建设总量。同时基本建设计划也应当紧密地联系着为建设的目的而调配一切必要材料与设备的可能性，要使这些材料和设备可能分出用于建设方面，且对原有的企业不发生直接的损失。
    建设财政拨付计划由下列两部分组成：
    １、建设费（包括三个月的材料储备），
    ２、弥补建设费的来源。
    国家预算的拨款是财政拨付的主要来源。
    经济机关本身由折旧与利润项下的投资是财政拨付的第二个来源。
    此外，经济机关财政计划中规定的资金，以及超计划的积累与内部资源的动员，都可以作为财政拨付的补充来源。
    在中国现时的情况下，似乎还没有这样详细地区分弥补科目的必要，一切建设费用都以通过预算较为适当。
    在建设过程中，财政拨付是按照批准的建设事业技术工业财政计划而实行，并通过工业银行及其支行（或分行）就地办理。
    建设的减低成本计划，是按照各个不同的部别，比较各种不同的建设单位对于已往计划时期的百分比而提出。它是按照每一单位对于建筑按装工程的每一因素而计算的，其价值是由直接费和附加费相加而成。
    直接费包括：材料、设备的价值，工人的主要工资，工程机械化的支出，辅助的经济事业与外部的供应（蒸汽、电力、水、土工、运输等等）。
    附加费包括：行政事务费，工人补充工资及津贴，公用事业费，建设警卫费，出差费、材料、建筑的结构与各部分的实验费，以及其他与现场建筑按装工程的直接施工无关的各种费用。
            （九）基本建设的总量与部门结构
    在人民经济中基本建设的总量及其在全国个别部门与地区的分配，应视某一期间国家的当前任务而决定。
    众所周知，著名的几次斯大林五年计划就是布尔什维克党在过去十五年至二十年间所实行的工业化政策的表现。根据这个计划，大部分的资金是用于工业企业的建设计划上面。
    建筑工程的计划总量及其在人民经济各部门之间的分配，并非盲目的或自流放任的，而是经过严格的考虑，符合政府与党在建设新社会的某一历史时期的政策。
    苏维埃国家，虽然和资本主义的国家还保持着一定的贸易经济关系，但它却在建立着完全独立于资本主义之外的新的共产主义社会。
    为此，苏维埃政府首先创立了大规模的重工业，依靠着它们才进行了人民经济的一切其他部门的彻底改造。
    在计划期间分配于基本建设的资金数量，决定于下列几个主要因素：
    第一决定于与人民经济计划同时编制的国家预算的可能性。如果在预算中存在有必要的后备力量，而政府又认为加速个别部门和单位的建设为当务之急，以便使它们的创建将有助于解决目前国家面前存在的一般经济任务，那么，这种可能性就更会扩大的。
    第二个决定国家基本建设最重要的因素，是为建设的目的而分配国内生产的和购自国外的必要建筑材料和设备的可能性。
    各计划期的建设与按装工程的总量，在个别年份中的预算条件下，可能大大地提高，但是，最必要的建筑材料，特别是设备的不足，也足以障碍这一点，因之，在编制基本建设计划的时候，对此应当特别注意。
    第三个决定基本建设计划大小的因素，就是为完成计划中的建筑按装工程所必需的劳动力（尤其是熟练的职工）。
    为使上述的两种情况在编制基本建设计划时予以确当地估计，必须预先制作全国建筑材料，设备和劳动力的平衡表，其中不仅应当考虑到建设的需要量，而且还要考虑到经营的需要量，即一切其他国民经济部门在建筑材料，设备和劳动力方面的经常需要。
    第四个决定基本建设总量的因素，是技术文件的状况，即在每一部门中关于新建的、改建的或恢复的单位准备完善的设计与预算。这对于那些为了施行建设需要大量财政资金，建筑材料，设备和劳动力的最大规模的建设尤为重要。
    考虑到这些主要的因素，便可决定全国的基本建设总量，并规定人民经济主要部门投资的预计数量（限度）。
    确定投资总量的这个阶段，称为人民经济各部门限度的制定，它在基本建设计划中是很重要的一个阶段。它可以慎重地说明人民经济每一部门的必要费用总量，并且避免建设大纲中不必要的铺张浪费。规定了各个部门的投资限度之后，基本建设计划便可在各部、署的具体设计中得到实际的内容。
    在苏联，基本建设的限度，是由苏联国家计划委员会与财政部在计划工作的最初阶段上共同制定的。通常每年的限度应在七、八月份制就，而较为长期的限度（五年计划），则应在展开这个工作的最初时期制定，不论日历的期限如何。
    由国家计划委员会提出的基本建设计划的年限度草案，预先须经政府审查与批准，然后将此限度送达各部、署，以便向个别的企业与建设单位进行分配。在下一个阶段，亦即在审查和批准各部，署与国家计划委员会所制定的人民经济计划草案的时候，也有对于业已批准的限度再加以部分的修正的情形，因为在详细审查计划草案之时，还会发现个别建设工程的脱漏。这种修正可使基本建设计划更为真实与实际地完成。
            （十）基本建设在全国各地区的分布
    保证生产力在国内的正确分布，也是基本建设计划的重要项目之一。在旧俄时代，生产力的分布是畸形的，工业都集中在中央地区：顿巴斯、乌拉岭、巴库和彼得堡（现在的列宁格勒），其余地区就没有先进的大规模工业。
    苏维埃国家实行了正确的平均工业分布的政策，使之靠近原料、燃料、电力的来源和消费地区，这样便保证了缩减不合理的和过远的运送，保证了国内落后的民族共和国与各地区文化经济的提高和国防能力的巩固。
    国内生产力正确分布的保证，须通过根据上述苏维埃国家的主要经济任务的决定而编制的基本建设计划来实现。
    在确定各部门与各企业的基本建设总量之后，应按地区做出综合表，由此可以确定个别地区发展的相互关系，说明个别的市、州与共和国建设工程的集中程度。
            （十一）完成基本建设计划的检查
    基本建设的计划和人民经济其他部门的计划，并不是以制妥计划为完结，而是要继续监督与检查这个计划的完成。完成基本建设计划的组织与检查工作对于人民经济具有极为重要的意义。
    在检查过程中应查明各部门，企业和地区完成计划的程度，揭发个别单位在建筑按装工程执行过程中的缺点，对建设机关予以帮助，设法消除在检查中所发现的缺点，探寻补充资源与后备力量，以求计划的超过完成。
    正确建立的完成计划的检查，不仅要发现建筑工程中存在的缺点，查明建筑工程发展与保证的偏差，并且要预防这种偏差，预见在建设大纲的完成上必然发生的困难。
    在苏联对于完成计划的检查工作是积极进行的，特别是，分别负责领导这种工作的计划机关和统计机关。
    苏联国家计划委员会在政府批准计划的三日至五日以后，检查各部与各署是否，将此计划送达各个企业。在检查过程中应判明各部对每一建设所制定的基本工程计划是否正确，这种计划是否符合国家计划，拨给各部的经费、劳动力、建筑材料及其他材料对各企业的分配正确到何种程度。
    在以下的检查过程中还应判明工程计划本身的完成，它的实际财政拨付的总额，生产能力利用量计划的完成，未完成的工程动态，住宅建设计划的完成，建设的材料、劳动力、图表的保证、机械的利用及其他问题。
    调查与统计在完成基本建设计划的检查中具有重要的意义，没有这两项，对于完成计划的严格设计与监督都是不可想像的。定期统计和经常调查的资料可以保证建设的必要材料、设备、劳动力和建筑机械，查明成本，财政指标及其他方面计划的完成。
    在建设中，正确建立的，完成计划的检查，就是工作组织良好的保障，管理建设事业的高度文化的表现和在领导与保证完成国家建设大纲的问题中的忠实助手。
              （十二）建筑工业
    在苏联特别地重视建筑工业的发展问题，即实行建筑工程的方法与技术。
    从前的建筑是以手工业进行的，没有采用必要的机器与设备。没有专门的建筑工人干部，建筑材料的生产是落后的。
    现在有了专门的建筑工人干部，大量地采用建筑机器和设备，以工业化的方法进行建筑。
    为了实现大规模的建设大纲，在国内建立了专业部和包工机关，它们的任务就是按照与委托者订立的合同，完成计划规定的建筑按装工程。
    包工建筑的机关和委托者，即为它而建筑的机关之间的相互关系，由政府所颁布的、关于包工合同的专门决议案来处理。委托者与包工者根据这个决议而订立建筑包修合同，这种建筑必须是列入政府所批准的总名称表中的。包工者对委托者须担负完成全部工程的责任，无论其自己直接施工的，或转包与副包工者间接完成的工程均同。包工者应按照合同规定的期限，符合委托者所交付的技术设计和预算以及工作蓝图，负责完成工程、并如期交工。
    建筑材料的基金，应按照完成建筑工程的数量与期限直接付给包工者。
    委托者是款额支配人和对包工者所进行工程的质量与期限的主要监督人。他付给建筑单位所需材料的基金于包工者，这项基金是为了保证一切设计中的材料和对既完成工程的支付。对于建筑工程的质量和利用生产能力的期限的日常监督，应由委托人自建筑开工之时起，成立一个未来企业的小型行政机构，它向包工者发给工作蓝图，运卸设备至建筑现场并帮助建筑工程的进行。这个机构也掌管在建筑期间由包工者随时交出的既成单位的接收。
    委托者是全部款项与对建筑拨付的资金的支配人。在进行建筑地区的工业银行分行，对包工者完成技术设计与预算上所规定的工程费。只有在这种工费已为委托者承兑之后始得支付。
    包工者有权领取转拨至建筑的一部分款项，以便开支于建筑所需的机械、运输、建筑器材的购置。在预算中这些资金应分出特别的一笔，所谓预算的第三部分。
    建筑的包工方法在苏联应用很广。现在设有两个大的包工部：重工业企业建设部和陆海军企业建设部，它们拥有巨大的工程阵线。
    此外，在许多盟员共和国内设立了住宅建设及土木工程专门的包工部和巨大的全共和国建筑托拉斯，以进行大的建筑工程。特别成立的有城市建设部，斯大林格勒市复兴局，塞瓦斯托波里市复兴局，以及许多纯为建设而成立的其他包工组织。
    除上述全联盟与共和国的专门的建设部之外，其他的许多部、署，例如：冶金工业、化学工业、航空工业、电力站、轻工业、食品工业等等，也有包工建筑的组织。
    包工组织拥有本身的巨大附属企业：石砂场、木材厂、水泥工厂、砖瓦工厂、制造各种建筑用的零件和辅助建筑材料的企业。在他们的手里掌握有大量的建筑机械和设备，汽车运输和其他建筑工具。
    与建筑工程的包工建筑方法同时，在苏联还建立了很多的自营方法，即实施建筑工程的机关同时也是某种建设工程资金的支配人。工业银行分行对这些建设作财政上的支付，是凭每月完成建筑按装工程的接收记录办理，其上须由建设处首长与新建设的企业的经理签署。
    在进行各种大模范建筑工程的企业中，设有领导全部建设过程的基本建设处，并与企业经理共同签署应由银行支付的建筑按装工程的接收记录。
    上述的建设领导方式与方法，是由实践中产生，而又在实际中充分地得到了证明。
    为了顺利地建立新的共产主义社会，苏联每年都在完成着庞大的建设大纲。
