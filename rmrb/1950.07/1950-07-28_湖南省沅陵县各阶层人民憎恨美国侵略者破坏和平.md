The people of all classes in Yuanling County, Hunan Province, expressed extreme anger at Truman's arrogant declaration of armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan. Yi Kuixi, a worker at the Xiangxi Power Plant, said: "We are not afraid of any aggression by American imperialism, and we must liberate Taiwan. The US imperialists are attempting to provoke a new world war, but it will be even more difficult to achieve in the face of the great victory of the Korean people." Zhang Yongsong, a farmer in Shengping Township, said: "The US imperialists are undermining peace, and we will mobilize the masses here to participate in the peace signature campaign to express our determination to uphold peace." A soldier from the county's militia said: "The US imperialists' aid to the Lee Seung-man puppet government is the same as their aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which can only serve as a transport team. The power of the people is always victorious." Women, shop assistants, and others in Yuanling expressed their hatred for the US imperialists.

At the first People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Yuanling County, all 83 representatives unanimously signed the peace declaration on July 13, and at the same time issued a telegram on behalf of the more than 360,000 people of Yuanling County, solemnly expressing their support for Chairman Mao's remarks and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and resolving to strengthen unity, improve production, and work hard to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the liberation cause of the Korean people with action.

　　湖南省沅陵县各阶层人民憎恨美国侵略者破坏和平
    【本报讯】湖南沅陵县各阶层人民，对杜鲁门所宣布的武装侵略朝鲜和台湾的狂妄声明，表示异常愤怒。湘西电厂工人易癸西说：“我们不怕美帝国主义的任何侵略，一定要解放台湾。美帝企图挑起新的世界大战，但在朝鲜人民的伟大胜利下，是更难实现了。”盛平乡农民张永松说：“美帝破坏和平，我们在这里要发动群众参加和平签名，表示拥护和平的决心。”县大队的一个战士说：“美帝帮助李承晚傀儡政府，也同援助蒋介石匪帮一样，只能起着运输队的作用。人民的力量是常胜的。”沅陵的妇女、商店店员等纷纷表示憎恨美帝。
    在沅陵县首届各界人民代表会议上全体代表八十三人于七月十三日一致在和平宣言上签了名，同时并代表沅陵县三十六万余人民发出通电，郑重表示拥护毛主席的谈话和周外长的声明，决心加强团结，搞好生产，努力工作，以行动支援解放台湾和声援朝鲜人民解放事业。
