　　Yanjing Paper Mill Improves Paper "Water Flow" Defect in July Competition; Paper Sales Increase Monthly

　　[Our Newspaper] In the July production competition, Yanjing Paper Mill improved the quality of its products. In the past, the paper produced by the factory often had a "water flow" defect, which affected sales. During the July competition, technicians Gang Jixu and Wang Tingfeng of the paper-making team carefully researched and tried inserting two rubber hoses into the water tank to draw off some of the water, lowering the water level behind the paper tank and stabilizing the water flow speed. This eliminated the "water flow" defect on the paper surface and improved product quality. To encourage their creative enthusiasm, the factory management committee awarded each of them 200 catties of millet.

　　In the past, the factory's product sales were very poor, mainly due to poor quality and high costs; a large backlog of inventory had accumulated, causing a serious situation of inflexible capital turnover. After the factory leaders clearly saw this key point, they actively sought ways to improve. The workers' representative conference held in April also focused on studying this issue, proposing: improve quality, reduce costs, expand markets, and break the sluggish sales phenomenon. In May, due to the reduction of coal consumption, etc., costs were reduced by 10%. The factory also improved its sales methods, providing various conveniences to customers, and successively established 17 consignment stores in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. The business situation gradually improved. In March, the factory only sold 2,494 reams of paper, but in May, it increased to 7,641 reams. In June, in addition to sales in the Beijing and Tianjin markets, customers in Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Baotou, Guihua and other places also placed orders one after another, and a total of 20,591 reams were sold throughout the month. By this point, most of the past inventory had been sold. Currently, the factory produces 11,500 reams per month, and the July plan is to sell 10,000 to 12,000 reams. The factory workers are currently striving to further improve quality, reduce costs, and complete the July production plan.

　　燕京造纸厂七月竞赛中
    改进纸面“水流”毛病
    纸张销路已逐月增加
    【本报讯】燕京造纸厂在七月生产竞赛中，改进了产品质量。过去该厂所产之纸，常有“水流”毛病，影响销路。七月竞赛中，抄纸班技工刚继绪、王廷峰精心钻研，试把两支胶皮管插入水槽，吸去一部分水，纸槽后面的水面降低，使水流速度平稳。这样即消除了纸面上的水流毛病，提高了产品质量。该厂管委会为鼓励其创造热情，每人奖予小米二百斤。
    该厂过去产品销路很不好，主要原因是质量差、成本高；积压了大批存货，造成资金周转不灵的严重情况。该厂领导上看清这一关键后，即积极设法改进。四月间召开的职工代表大会上也着重研究了这一问题，提出：提高质量，减低成本，增辟市场，打破滞销现象。五月间由于煤耗等的减低，成本降低了百分之十。并改善营业方法，给顾客种种方便，先后在京、津等地建立了十七家代销店。营业状况逐渐好转。该厂三月份仅销二千四百九十四令纸，五月份已增至七千六百四十一令。六月份除推销于京、津市场外，石家庄、新乡、包头、归绥等地顾客亦纷纷定购，全月共销出两万零五百九十一令。至此，过去存货大部售清。如今该厂月产一万一千五百令，七月份计划推销一万至一万二千令。该厂职工目前正为进一步提高质量，减低成本，完成七月份生产计划而奋斗。
