　　Xinhua News Agency: East China Military and Political Committee's Department of Industry's factories and mines' total production value in May exceeded the plan by 8.9%, and the production situation generally tended to improve. The steel and electrical industries, which accepted orders from the Central People's Government, achieved even greater production results than planned. The output of steel ingots and cast steel exceeded the plan by 157.3%, and steel by 88.9%. After the National Machine Industry Conference, the machine industry gradually returned to normal due to the acceptance of state orders. In May, general purpose, Jingmei, Nanjing and other machine factories completed and exceeded their production plans. In the mining industry, the output of the Ma'anshan pyrite mine exceeded the plan by 26.6%. The production efficiency of the Huainan Coal Mine increased by more than 20% compared with the past; however, due to the sluggish sales of stored coal, the production plan could not be fully completed. The chemical industry also tended to improve as actual sales in the market gradually increased. The Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, which had been shut down or reduced production due to sluggish sales, resumed work at the end of the month. Since the cigarette industry switched to direct sales instead of allocation, sales have also opened up. The main products with poor sales throughout the month included bituminous coal, bicycles, small tools, telephone exchanges, light bulbs, batteries, V-belts, paint, and soap. The relationship between production and sales needs to be adjusted.
　　Xinhua News Agency: After several major state-owned factories in Northwest China initially implemented quota management and production responsibility systems, production in May has improved. After the Xi'an People's Power Plant implemented the production responsibility system, the coal consumption rate has been reduced from 2.06 kg per kilowatt-hour in March to 1.47 kg in May, and the line loss in May was also reduced by 1.8% compared with April. The production cost of the plant has been significantly reduced as a result. The three factories under the Northwest People's Textile and Construction Company, which often failed to complete production tasks, have exceeded their May plans; compared with April, yarn increased by 6.81% in May and cloth increased by 10.78%. After strengthening the factory management committee, the Northwest Machine Factory, workers put forward 140 rationalization proposals on saving raw materials, improving technology, and other aspects, and completed many rational reforms. As a result, the product cost of the factory in May has been reduced by 33% compared with March. At present, other state-owned factories in Northwest China are clearing assets and checking the implementation of the democratic management system in order to prepare conditions for further implementation of quota management and production responsibility systems.

　　华东西北公营企业五月生产显著改进
    【新华社讯】华东军政委员会工业部所属厂矿五月份的生产总值超过计划百分之八点九，生产情况一般趋向好转。接受中央人民政府定货的钢铁、电器两业，生产成绩超过计划尤多。钢锭及铸钢的产量超过百分之一百五十七点三，钢材超过百分之八十八点九。全国机器工业会议后，机器业由于接受了国家订货，生产亦渐趋正常。五月份通用、精美、南京等机器厂完成并超过了生产计划。矿业方面，马鞍山硫化铁矿产量超过计划百分之二十六点六。淮南煤矿生产效率较前提高了百分之二十以上；但因存煤滞销，生产计划未能全部完成。化学工业因市场实销渐多，生产亦趋好转，因滞销而停工减产的天原电化厂已于月底复工。卷烟业自改用直接推销代替配货的方式后，销路亦已打开。全月销路不好的主要产品有烟煤、自行车、小工具、电话交换机、电灯泡、电池、三角皮带、油漆及肥皂等，产销关系尚待调整。
    【新华社讯】西北若干主要公营工厂初步推行定额管理和生产责任制后，五月份生产已有改进。西安人民电厂在实行生产责任制后，耗煤率已由三月份的每度电二点零六公斤，降低到五月份的一点四七公斤，线路损失五月份比四月份也降低百分之一点八。该厂生产成本因而显著降低。经常不能完成生产任务的西北人民纺建公司所属三个工厂已超额完成五月份计划；和四月份比较，五月份纱增加了百分之六点八一，布增加了百分之十点七八。西北机器厂在健全了工厂管理委员会之后，工人们提出一百四十条关于节约原料、改进技术等合理化建议，完成了很多合理改革。因此该厂五月份的产品成本已较三月份降低百分之三十三。现西北其他各公营工厂均在清查资产和检查民主管理制的执行情况，以为进一步推行定额管理和生产责任制准备条件。
