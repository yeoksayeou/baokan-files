　　This Time, I Truly Enlisted
    Guo Xueshi

    (I)
    My greatest gain in this dyke-building production was that I truly enlisted.

    Before, when the soldiers saw me, they didn't say anything, and both sides felt quite awkward.

    After returning from production, I went to the squad. Liu Changchun said to me, "To be honest, when you first came, we really couldn't stand you. This time you participated in labor and put down your airs, and we all like you a lot!" Then Cao Mingxin said, "Culture Instructor, do you remember? When you first came, you only cared about teaching classes, and you didn't care about anything after class, like a university professor. Now you've changed a lot!" Hearing these words, I felt an unspeakable joy in my heart.

    (II)

    When I heard the troop's call to go and dig rivers and build dikes, I felt a little scared, so I went to the instructor and raised an objection, guaranteeing that while others were working, I would prepare my lessons well. When the soldiers rested, I would go and teach them to read. The instructor replied, "We are cadres, and in addition to doing our original work, we must also take the lead in working."

    As a result, I couldn't sleep well, couldn't eat, and had no heart to prepare lessons.

    On March 21st, the instructor had a talk with me, advising me not to be afraid. He also said that the higher-ups had already instructed that comrades with weak bodies should be given appropriate care; besides, labor is also good for the body. Later, the company commander told me that I was assigned to the second squad for production. I had no choice but to prepare a few pieces of old clothing for production.

    After breakfast, I went to the second squad. Before I even entered, I heard people inside saying, "The Culture Instructor's hands are like noodles, how can he do anything? I think our second squad is bound to fall behind!" Finally, someone said, "Don't say that. If he doesn't come to our squad, he'll have to go to another squad. If he comes, we must help him more. Doesn't the branch have a resolution for mutual assistance? Besides, it will be much more convenient for us to learn culture." After such a commotion, I didn't dare to go inside and returned to the company headquarters.

    (III)

    After marching for a few days, I got three big blisters on my feet, and it was difficult to finally reach the destination. As soon as we arrived, everyone climbed onto the riverbank to see the terrain. Looking east, two rugged earthen dikes stretched far away, disappearing into villages and forests. The river had shallow, slow-flowing water, but from the inner slope of the riverbank, the traces of erosion by the waves were very clear. Compared with the villages on both banks, the riverbed was three meters higher than the rooftops. If the river breached its banks, the lives and property of one hundred thousand people would be destroyed. But I thought: How long will it take to complete such a large project?

    The project began, and I felt that I was a cadre, so I took the lead in carrying soil. I originally hoped that the soldiers would cheer me on when they saw me, but some of them said, "Culture Instructor carrying soil, why is it swaying at both ends?" I felt very annoyed in my heart.

    A day or two passed, and the labor continued. Fatigue and pain enveloped me, and I felt that the sun was also moving slowly.

    I carried the soil, with my head down, without saying a word. The instructor advised me to rest for a while, and the soldiers loaded less soil into my basket, but I was still left behind by the soldiers several times. I thought digging soil might be easier, so I asked to exchange work with the soldiers who were digging soil. Who knew, even though I worked non-stop, I still couldn't keep up with the others' baskets. Before long, I got two blisters on my hands, and the time the baskets waited for soil became even longer.

    Just then, the rest signal sounded. As soon as I lay down, the education cadre came to understand the soldiers' cultural learning situation and demanded, "Eradicate illiteracy below three hundred characters by the end of June, and the Culture Instructor's teaching methods must be combined with production." As soon as I heard this, my anger flared up: "This is nonsense, how can it be combined! I'm made to carry soil, and then I'm made to teach characters, when am I supposed to rest?" The words were on the tip of my tongue, but I didn't say them.

### 我这一回才真正入了伍

　　我这一回才真正入了伍
    郭学诗
    （一）
    我在这次筑堤生产中最大的收获就是真正入了伍。
    以前战士们见了我，什么话也不说，双方都觉得挺蹩扭。
    生产回来后，我到了班上。刘常春对我说：“说实话吧，你刚来时，我们真有点看不惯。这回你参加劳动，放下了架子，我们都挺喜欢你的！”接着曹明信说：“文化教员，你还记得吗？你刚来时光管上课，下了课就不管事了，像个大学教授似的。现在可转变的多了！”听到这些话，我心里感到说不出来的痛快。
    （二）
    我听到部队动员去挖河打堤的号召时，心里有些害怕，就去找指导员提了个意见，保证在别人作活时，我就好好的准备功课。等战士一休息，我就去教他们识字。指导员回答说：“咱们是干部，除了做原来的工作外，还必须带头去干活。”
    这么一来，我觉也睡不好，饭也吃不下去，更没心预备功课了。
    三月二十一日，指导员找我谈了一次话，劝我不要害怕。并说上级早有指示，对身体弱的同志应当给以适当的照顾；再说劳动劳动，对身体也有好处。后来连长告诉我：生产时，我编在二班。我没法，就准备了几件生产时用的破衣裳。
    早饭后，我到二班去。还没进门，就听见屋里正在说：“文化教员的手像面条似的，能干得了什么呀？我看咱们二班非落后不可！”最后说：“别说啦。他要不到咱们班来，就得到别的班去。他来了，咱们要多帮助他。支部不是有互相帮助的决议吗？再说咱们学文化就方便多啦。”这么一闹，我也没敢进屋就回到连部了。
    （三）
    行了几天军，脚上起了三个大泡，好容易才到达了目的地。一到目的地，大家就登上河堤看地形。向东看，两条崎岖的土堤伸得很远，一直被村庄和树林掩没了为止。河里浅水缓流，但从河堤内坡看来，被波浪冲蚀的痕迹却十分清楚。与两岸村庄相比，河底高出屋顶三公尺。倘若河决了口，十万个百姓的生命财产即将同归于尽。可是我想：这么大的工程，多时做完呢？
    工程开始了，自己觉着是个干部，就带头挑土。原指望战士们看见了给叫个好，谁知有的却说：“文化教员担土，怎么两头晃呢？”我听了心里很烦恼。
    一两天过去了，劳动仍然继续进行着。疲劳和痛苦笼罩着我，我觉得太阳也走的慢了。
    我挑着土，低着头，一句话也没说。指导员劝我休息一下，战士们给我筐里少装土，但我还是被战士们拉下了好几趟。我觉着挖土也许轻松些，就要求和挖土的战士换工。谁知道，虽然自己不停地干，也还供不上人家的筐。不一会，手上起了两个泡，筐子等土的时间拉的更长了。
    恰好，这时休息号响了。我刚刚躺下，教育干事又来了解战士的文化学习情况，要求：“六月底消灭三百字以下的文盲，文化教员的教学方法要与生产相结合。”一听到这个，我的火就上来了：“真是乱弹琴，怎么结合呀！让挑土，又让教字，什么时候让休息呢？”话到口边可是没有说出来。
