Unified Enrollment for Municipal Middle Schools
　　Enrollment Committee Established; Registration and Examination Dates Confirmed.
　　[News from the Kyoto Municipal News Agency] The Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has decided to implement unified enrollment for all municipal secondary schools this summer. This enrollment method will, on the one hand, save manpower and resources, reduce the mental and temporal burden on students, and avoid duplicate enrollment of new students by various schools; on the other hand, it will ensure that the admission standards of municipal secondary schools are consistent and that organized manual workers' children are given unified consideration for admission. The "Enrollment Committee" has now been established, with members from the Bureau of Culture and Education, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the principals (or heads of teaching) of various schools. The Enrollment Committee has five groups: General Affairs, Admissions Information and Registration, Examination Venue, Examination Questions and Papers, and Allocation. The temporary office is located within the Bureau of Culture and Education. The examination dates are July 16th for junior high school, July 17th and 18th for senior high school; and July 12th for Advanced Vocational School, Advanced Commercial School, and Beijing Normal School. Registration time: July 10th to 13th for general senior and junior high schools; July 6th to 10th for Beijing Normal School, and July 3rd to 10th for Advanced Vocational School and Advanced Commercial School. Registration locations are at the respective schools. Examination subjects: Chinese, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge for junior high school; Chinese, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, History and Geography, Natural History, and Political Common Sense for senior high school. Registration fee: 3,000 yuan for junior high school, 4,000 yuan for senior high school.
