    Xinhua News Agency, Bern, July 2nd: According to TASS, the Secretariat of the Swiss Labor Party issued a statement condemning the provocations carried out by the South Korean puppet government under the direction of American imperialism, and American interference in Korea and various Far Eastern countries. The statement pointed out the connection between these provocations and interference, and the recent visit of U.S. Secretary of State advisor Dulles to South Korea. The statement said, "MacArthur's ban on the Japanese Communist Party is new proof of American imperialism's interference in the internal affairs of all countries and its desire to achieve world hegemony."
    The Secretariat expressed sympathy with the Korean people for defending the unification of Korea, and urged all friends of peace to be doubly vigilant and work to expand the peace signature campaign, thereby preventing war.
