　　To the Editor:
　　My original home is Zhanggezhuang, Fourth District, Funing County, Hebei Province. Originally, the village had a population of about two hundred people and over forty acres of land. During the Liberation War, because of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit troops' burning, killing, and looting, about two-thirds of the village's population fled. When land reform was implemented, over forty acres of land were then allocated to the two-thirds of the population remaining in the village for cultivation. It was calculated that each person received four mu of land (only one qing of land was designated and temporarily managed by the Farmers' Association, ready to be distributed to the fugitive households returning to the village for cultivation). After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, most of the fugitive population returned to the village. Before the spring plowing this year, the village evenly distributed the land under temporary management to the returning households, calculating one mu of land per person.
　　The one qing of land originally designated for future distribution was all fertile land. When the fugitive population gradually returned to the village, the village cadres transferred the good land to their own names and distributed poor, barren land to everyone.
　　Comrade Editor, is this practice of the village cadres reasonable?
　　Guo Zijiu
　　Editor's Note: We hope the Funing County Government will investigate the land distribution situation in Zhanggezhuang and publish it in the newspaper.

　　对逃亡户回村生产问题抚宁县府应予适当解决编辑先生：
    我的原籍是河北省抚宁县第四区张各庄。该村原有人口约二百人，土地四十余顷。在解放战争中，因为国民党反动派匪军烧杀抢劫，全村人口约有二分之一强逃亡在外。实行土地改革时，四十余顷土地遂分配给该村二分之一的人口耕种。计每人分地四亩（只划出土地一顷，由农会暂时代管，准备分给逃亡户回庄耕种）。京津解放后，逃亡人口大部还庄。本年春耕前，该庄即以代管地平均分给回庄各户，计每人分地一亩。
    原来划出留待以后分配的土地一顷，均系膏腴良田。迨逃亡人口陆续回庄，村干部即将好地转到自己名下，另以浇瘠之地给大家平分。
    编者同志，村干部这种作法是否合理？
    郭子久
    编者按：张各庄土地分配的情况，望抚宁县政府调查一下，在报上公布。
