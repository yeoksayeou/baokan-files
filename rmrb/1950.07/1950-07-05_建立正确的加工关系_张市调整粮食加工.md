　　Establishing Correct Processing Relationships
    Zhangjiakou City Adjusts Grain Processing
    [Zhangjiakou News] To support private flour mills in maintaining production, the Zhangjiakou City Grain Company and the City Supply and Marketing Cooperative have allocated 18 million jin of grain for processing over the past five months. However, several serious shortcomings occurred during the processing, and the City Industry Bureau has made appropriate adjustments in conjunction with all parties. Zhangjiakou City's private flour milling industry has as many as 127 electric stone mills, totaling 216 stone grinders. If their production capacity is fully utilized, they can produce 345,600 jin of oat flour daily, requiring approximately 432,000 jin of raw materials. Since the beginning of spring, the supply of raw materials on the market has decreased. Especially after price stabilization, product sales have been sluggish, causing financial difficulties for smaller businesses. Over 90 households rely on processing to survive. From January to May, the Grain Company and the City Supply and Marketing Cooperative allocated 18 million jin of grain for processing, stipulating a processing rate of 70%, resulting in 12.6 million jin of oat flour. With a net profit rate of 7%, the income of processing households reached approximately 882,000 jin, maintaining the production of the industry. However, due to the large number of processing households, the supply of raw materials was sometimes insufficient, and production capacity could not be fully utilized. Furthermore, the allocation procedures for processing grain were mostly handled by the processing team leaders, and the leadership neglected inspection. Therefore, individual manufacturers took the opportunity to engage in private gain, resulting in unfair distribution. Those who should have received grain either did not receive it or received very small quantities, making it difficult to survive. The team leaders themselves accumulated large quantities, and there were serious phenomena of secretly misappropriating processing grain and long-term arrears. Some cadres of the company also colluded with individual processing households, accepting bribes and embezzling. For example, Guo Zengyi and others from the company's business section embezzled more than 3.32 million yuan (Guo has now fled). In order to carry out processing in a planned manner, adjust the relationship between public and private sectors, overcome the current temporary difficulties, and avoid the loss of state assets, the City Industry Bureau, in conjunction with the company's rectification of cadre work style, also reorganized the processing households. First, public and private sectors frankly discussed and explained the real profits of processing with concrete calculation facts, reversing the claims of some manufacturers who concealed the real product rate and shouted "no profit in processing" and "the public sector is squeezing out the private sector." To help solve the industry's difficulties in slack season production, the company reduced the processing rate from 70% to 69%. Through negotiation, manufacturers in the industry realized that the government's support for the development of private industry and commerce was sincere. The Grain Company also handled processing households cautiously. Based on market needs and the current raw material situation, it tried its best to maintain production and avoid excessive unemployment of workers. In addition to consulting with the trade association to solicit the opinions of capitalists, it also listened to the workers' reflections in conjunction with the trade union. Those with greater capital and the ability to maintain production and sales independently were mobilized to no longer process, while others who had to rely on processing to maintain production negotiated the amount of processing based on their capital and management situation, so as to appropriately expand the processing scope. After consultation, 59 processing households with 106 stone grinders were determined, with an average processing rate of 68% per machine. Now the company, the city cooperative, and the district grain depot can allocate 2.6 million jin of naked oats. In this way, each processing household can change from the past one shift plus self-milling part to two shifts of production, improving productivity; with medium-quality raw materials, the net profit rate can reach 8%. Furthermore, because processing households with the strength to maintain their own production and sales are mobilized to no longer process, the state can focus on supporting households with greater and more difficulties with greater strength. In order to lead the processing industry and overcome the misappropriation of processing grain by some manufacturers in the past, and to ensure the safety of processing, after deliberation, contracts were formally signed with households as units, and the organization was adjusted to establish a special agency of the Processing Committee to be responsible for leading, supervising, and handling the daily affairs of processing.

　　建立正确的加工关系
    张市调整粮食加工
    【本报张家口讯】张市粮食公司、市供销总社，为扶助私营面粉业维持生产，五个月先后拨出加工粮一千八百万斤。惟在加工过程中，曾发生若干严重缺点，市工业局对此已结合各方作了适当调整。张市私营面粉业，仅电力石磨即达一百二十七家，石磨二百一十六台，如充分发挥生产效能，可日产莜面三十四万五千六百斤，约需原料四十三万二千斤。自入春后，原料上市减少，尤以物价稳定后，产品滞销，资力较小的即感周转困难，其中九十余户，即赖加工维持。粮食公司及市供销总社自一至五月，先后拨出加工粮一千八百万斤，规定工缴率百分之七十，计产莜面一千二百六十万斤，纯利率以百分之七计算，加工户收益约达八十八万二千斤，维持了该业的生产。但因加工户多，原料有时供应不足，生产力不能充分发挥，且加工粮的拨配手续，多经加工组长之手，领导又疏于检查，故有个别厂商，借机营私，分配不公，应加工者得不到粮或拨粮数量极少，不能维持。而组长本身却积存极多，间有暗中挪用加工粮与长期拖欠的严重现象，公司的某些干部，又勾结个别加工户，受贿贪污。如该公司业务科郭增易等受贿贪污即达三百三十二万余元（郭现已潜逃）。市工业局为有计划地进行加工，以调整公私关系，度过目前暂时困难，避免国家资财的损失，结合公司整顿干部作风，对加工户亦加以整理。首先，公私开诚相商，以具体计算的事实，说明加工的真实利润，扭转某些厂商隐蔽真实产品率而喊“加工无利”、“公家挤垮私人”的说法。公司为扶助解决该业淡月生产的困难，又将工缴率由百分之七十降为百分之六十九。在协商中使该业厂商认识到政府扶助私营工商业的发展是诚心实意的。粮食公司又为慎重处理加工户，根据市场需要及目前原料情况，尽可能维持生产，避免工人过多的失业，除经同业公会征询资方意见外，并结合工会听取工人反映，而采取资力较大，产销能自力维持者，动员其不再加工，其他必须依靠加工维持者，又依其资力及经营情况协商加工的数量，以适当扩大加工面。经协商结果，确定加工户五十九家，石磨一百零六台，平均每台加工率为百分之六十八。现公司、市社、区粮库即可拨出莜麦二百六十万斤。这样，各加工户可由过去的一班加自磨部分改为两班生产，提高生产率；以中常质量的原料，纯利润率可达百分之八。再由于对有力量自己维持产销的加工户动员其不再加工，故国家即可以较大力量，重点扶助有较大较多的困难户。为了领导该业加工，并克服过去某些厂商挪用加工粮，保证加工的安全，经酝酿以户为单位，正式签订合同，调整组织，成立加工委员会的专门机构负责领导并监督、处理加工中的日常事务。
