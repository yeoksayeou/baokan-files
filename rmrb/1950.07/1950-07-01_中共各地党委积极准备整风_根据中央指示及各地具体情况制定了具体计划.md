Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Since the CCP Central Committee issued the "Directive on Party Rectification" on May 1st, the CCP Central Bureaus, Sub-bureaus, and their affiliated Party committees at all levels have been actively preparing for Party rectification. Based on the CCP Central Committee's directives and the specific conditions in various regions, they have formulated their own Party rectification plans, defining the specific principles, steps, and methods for Party rectification.

Because East China, Central South, South China, Northwest, and Southwest regions need to begin land reform and rent reduction work after the autumn of this year, the Party rectification plans in these regions stipulate that the rectification of cadres should be completed before the autumn. In North China and Northeast China, because land reform has been basically completed, the Party rectification work in these two regions is scheduled to be completed before the spring plowing next year.

East China:
The CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau's Party rectification plan stipulates: This Party rectification will first focus on cadres at and above the county and regimental level, and then use them to lead the rectification of cadres below the county level and those participating in land reform, as well as cadres in urban organs and troops who are not participating in land reform. Troops still tasked with combat missions will not undergo Party rectification for the time being. For veteran cadres, the focus is on rectifying ideology and work style, while for new cadres, the focus is on class education. In Party rectification studies, the emphasis is on examining ideology, work, and work style, rather than on examining class background or history. Party rectification will focus on education and transformation, while individual corrupt and degenerate elements who seriously harm the interests of the people will be given the disciplinary sanctions they deserve. County, district, and township cadres, as well as land reform cadres, will all adopt the method of concentrated Party rectification in batches and rotations. The Party schools and other training institutions of the provincial and district Party committees should first select cadres above the county level (or above the district chief and district Party committee secretary) for concentrated Party rectification, with a period of one and a half months per session, starting in June and completing three sessions. The Party training teams and other training institutions of the prefectural Party committees should select general cadres from counties and districts and cadres participating in land reform for concentrated Party rectification, with a period of twenty days to one month per session, starting from late July. County Party committees should run short-term training classes to select cadres at the district and village levels for rotational Party rectification, with each session limited to half a month to twenty days, starting in August. All three should be completed by October. The Party rectification study for cadres in urban areas and troops will be led by the learning committee organized by the Party committee, generally for a period of three months. In the Party rectification study, one-third of the time must be used for the study of land reform policies.

Central South:
The CCP Central Committee's Central South Bureau's Party rectification plan stipulates: This Party rectification should first be based on and around the two central tasks of preparing for land reform in the Central South Region (or rent reduction movement in non-land reform areas) and strengthening financial and economic work and urban management work. In areas preparing to implement land reform, the focus is on rectifying land reform cadres; in non-land reform areas, the focus is on rectifying rent reduction cadres; in cities, the focus is on rectifying financial and economic and labor movement cadres. In terms of rectification content, rural cadres should mainly review the implementation of rent reduction and anti-hegemony and land reform policies and oppose commandism, and should also summarize grain requisition work, link it with tax collection work, and study the correct implementation of reasonable burden policies; financial and economic cadres should focus on checking the implementation of tax revenue, trade, financial policies, enterprise management, and public-private relations, labor-capital relations policies, rectifying the ideological style of violating policies, being divorced from reality, and being divorced from the masses, and opposing bad tendencies such as corruption and squandering state property. Cadres above the county Party committee secretary are mainly trained directly by the provincial and district Party committees, and then the trained county and district responsible cadres return to their hometowns to lead the collective training of general district-level and new cadres. Financial and economic cadres are trained separately by the Central South Financial Committee and the provincial financial committees. The training of people's court cadres is planned by the Land Committee and the Ministry of Justice. Veteran cadres adopt the method of holding meetings for Party rectification, and new Party members and new cadres adopt short-term rotational training or collective training methods.

Northwest:
The Party rectification steps stipulated by the CCP Central Committee's Northwest Bureau are: Before the summer requisition (in June), each county should convene a meeting of cadres at the county, district, and township levels to initially rectify the work style of cadres in conjunction with the preparation for the summer requisition (lasting about a week to ten days), solve some of the more prominent problems, so that the summer requisition task can be successfully completed, and prepare ideologically for the subsequent strict rectification of cadres' work style. During the summer requisition period, the provincial and district Party committees should convene Party rectification meetings for cadres above the county Party committee secretary, lasting for half a month to twenty days. These Party rectification meetings for cadres above the county Party committee must be held well, and then it will be possible to rectify the vast number of cadres through them. After the summer requisition and before land reform in August and September, another meeting of three-level cadres should be held to further rectify and focus on opposing the bad phenomena of commandism, favoritism, using public office for private gain, and beating and scolding the masses, and it is also necessary to clarify policies and tell methods so that the autumn requisition, land reform, and other policies can be correctly implemented.

Southwest:
The CCP Central Committee's Southwest Bureau's Party rectification plan stipulates that it should be divided into two steps. The first step is to first concentrate the cadres above the county Party committee secretary for Party rectification by the provincial and district Party committees, and then rely on them as the backbone to lead the Party rectification of the remaining cadres. The second step is to focus on the prefectural Party committee or the stronger county Party committee secretaries, concentrate the cadres above the branch committee secretary for Party rectification, and then popularize it to other cadres.

North China:
The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau's Party rectification plan stipulates: Before the autumn harvest, the provincial Party committees should select the main cadres of the county and prefectural Party committees for Party rectification study, and then the district cadres will be trained in rotation by the prefectural or county Party committees. After the autumn harvest, branch rectification will be carried out this winter and next spring. The main methods are to train village cadres in rotation, continue to strengthen the work of the open Party, summarize and check work, award hero models, and conduct democratic elections in branches. The Party rectification of leading organs and schools at all levels will be carried out through methods such as checking organ work, cadre appraisal, Party representative meetings or congresses.

Northeast:
The CCP Central Committee's Northeast Bureau's Party rectification plan stipulates: First, rectify the work style of leading cadres in counties and above and larger mines, railways (sections and important stations), important companies, stores, banks, cooperatives, and other economic organs and enterprises, then rectify the work style of general Party member cadres, and finally conduct a key rectification of branch Party members. The universal rectification and education of branch Party members will then be transferred to regular work. Cadres above the county level and in important enterprises mainly use the methods of studying documents, holding meetings to check and summarize work, and, where possible, implementing short-term concentrated rotational training; district, village, and branch cadres mainly use the method of short-term rotational training combined with checking work; the rectification of branch Party members mainly strengthens the education of basic policies and basic knowledge of the Party.

The most important Party rectification study document stipulated in various regions is Chairman Mao Zedong's report "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation" at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP. Senior CCP officials in various regions will give local Party rectification reports based on Chairman Mao's report and the local work situation, tasks, and tendencies within the Party. Other Party rectification study documents include: (1) Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform at the Third Plenary Session of the CCP Central Committee; (2) Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Beijing celebration of the May Day Labor Day cadre meeting; (3) The CCP Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals; (4) Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists' ability to unite and cooperate with non-Party masses.

　　中共各地党委积极准备整风
    根据中央指示及各地具体情况制定了具体计划
    【新华社三十日讯】自中共中央于五月一日发出《关于整党的指示》以后，中共各中央局、分局及其所属各级党委即积极进行整党的准备工作，并根据中共中央指示及各地具体情况制定了自己整党计划，规定了整党的具体方针、步骤及方法。
    由于华东、中南、华南、西北、西南等地区须于今年秋后开始进行土地改革及减租工作，故这些地区的整党计划都规定于秋前首先完成整顿干部的工作。华北及东北因为土地改革已基本上完成，所以该两地区的整党工作定于明年春耕前完成。
    华东：
    中共中央华东局的整党计划规定：此次整风首先着重于县、团级以上的干部，然后经过他们去领导县以下和参加土改工作的干部以及城市机关、部队中不参加土改工作的干部的整风。目前仍负有作战任务的部队，则暂不进行整风。对老干部着重整思想，整作风，对新干部着重阶级教育。在整风学习中着重于查思想，查工作，查作风，而不着重于查成份，查历史。整风以教育改造为主，对于个别严重危害人民利益的腐化堕落分子则给以应得的纪律制裁。县、区、乡干部及土改干部皆采取分批轮流集中整风方式。省委或区党委的党校及其他轮训机构，应首先抽调县以上（或区长及区委书记以上）的干部集中整风，以一个半月为一期，从六月开始，分三期整训完毕。地委的党训队及其他轮训机构，应抽调县、区一般干部及参加土改工作的干部集中整风，以二十天至一个月为一期，从七月下旬开始。县委办短期轮训班，抽调区村一级干部轮流整风，每期以半个月至二十天为限，从八月开始。三者一律于十月结束。城市及部队的在职干部的整风学习由党委组织学习委员会领导，一般以三个月为限。整风学习中，均须以三分之一的时间用于土改政策的学习。
    中南：
    中共中央中南局的整党计划规定：此次整党应首先根据与围绕中南区当前准备实行土地改革（在非土改区则进行减租运动）和加强财经工作及城市管理工作这两个中心任务进行。在准备实行土改的地区，以整训土改干部为主；在非土改区，以整训减租干部为主；在城市以整训财经及工运干部为主，在整训内容上，农村干部以检讨执行减租反霸和土改政策的情形和反对命令主义为主，并须同时总结征粮工作，联系税收工作，学习合理负担政策的正确实施；财经工作干部应着重检查税收、贸易、金融政策、企业管理及公私关系、劳资关系政策的实施情形，整顿违背政策、脱离实际、脱离群众的思想作风，反对贪污腐化、不爱惜国家财产等不良倾向。县委书记以上干部主要由省委及区党委直接负责整训，然后由受过训的县区负责干部，回乡领导一般区级及新干部集训。财经干部由中南财委会及省财委会分别负责整训。人民法庭干部的整训由土地委员会与司法部负责计划。老干部采取开会整风方式，新党员新干部采取短期轮训或集训办法。
    西北：
    中共中央西北局所规定的整党步骤是：各县在夏征前（六月间），召开一次县、区、乡三级干部会议，结合夏征准备，初步整顿一次干部作风（时间约一周至十日），解决一些较为突出的问题，使夏征任务顺利完成，并为以后严格整顿干部作风作好思想准备。在夏征期间，各省委、区党委应召开县委书记以上的干部整风会议，时间为半月至二十天。必须把这个县委以上干部的整风会议开好，然后才有可能经过他们整顿广大干部。夏征后至土地改革以前的八九月，再开一次三级干部会议，作进一步整顿，集中反对强迫命令主义及耍私情、借公报私、打骂群众等恶劣现象，并要讲清政策，告诉办法，使秋征、土改及其他政策能正确贯彻下去。
    西南：
    中共中央西南局的整党计划规定分作两步，第一步先由省委、区党委集中县委书记以上干部整风，然后依靠他们为骨干，去领导其余干部整风。第二步以地委或较强的县委书记为重心，集中分委书记以上干部整风，然后普及于其他干部。
    华北：
    中共中央华北局的整风计划规定：秋收前，各省委抽调县委地委主要干部进行整风学习，然后以地委或县委为单位轮训区干部。秋收后，于今冬明春进行支部整顿，其主要方法是轮训村干部，继续加强公开党的工作，总结检查工作，评奖英雄模范，进行支部民主选举。各级领导机关和学校的整风则通过检查机关工作、干部鉴定、党代表会议或代表大会等方式进行。
    东北：
    中共中央东北局的整党计划规定：首先整顿县以上及较大矿厂、铁路的段和重要车站、重要的公司、商店、银行、合作社及其他经济机关与企业中领导干部的作风，然后是整顿一般党员干部的作风，最后对支部党员作一次重点整理，支部党员的普遍整理教育，则转入经常工作中进行。县以上与重要企业单位的干部以学习文件，开会检查与总结工作的方式为主，在可能条件下，实行短期集中轮训；区、村与支部干部则以短期轮训结合检查工作的方式为主；支部党员的整理主要是加强基本政策、党的基本知识的教育。
    各地所规定的最主要的整风学习文件是毛泽东主席在中共七届三中全会上的报告《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》。各地中共党的高级负责人员将根据毛主席报告和地方工作的情况、任务以及党内倾向，作地方性的整风报告。其他的整风学习文件包括：（一）刘少奇在中共三中全会上关于土地改革问题的报告；（二）刘少奇在北京庆祝五一劳动节干部大会上的演说；（三）中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定；（四）斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作。
