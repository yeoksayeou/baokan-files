　　The Vietnamese student delegation attending the Second World Student Congress passed through China on its way to Prague. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, this reporter visited the head of the delegation, Huang Mingzheng, who kindly shared the following remarks:

　　"Vietnamese Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Huang Mingjian issued a statement on the 15th of this month condemning American aggression against Korea, China, and Vietnam; Viet Minh Chairman and Vietnam National United Front Central Committee Chairman Huang Guoyue firmly expressed his support for the government's statement, opposing American aggression and supporting the fighting Korean people. This represents the consistent attitude and opinion of all the Vietnamese people.

　　"Since February 11th of last year, the Day Against Colonial Rule, Vietnamese youth and students have expressed their determination to fight imperialism through various actions called for by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. The Vietnamese people's struggle for peace is closely linked with the worldwide peace and democracy camp's struggle for peace.

　　"In the capacity of representing all Vietnamese university and secondary school students and over 2.5 million young people, I express my boundless anger at the American aggression against Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam."

　　Then, Director Huang briefly described their impressions of their half-month stay in China and their journey.

　　"Chinese democratic youth organizations and youth in various cities along the way have been very concerned about us and have treated us warmly. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude.

　　"Although our time traveling in China was very short, we witnessed the Chinese people and youth's expression of their determination to defend world peace. We are deeply experiencing this enormous strength of peace-loving. In the short time we arrived in various places, we saw many young people explaining the principles of defending world peace to the masses through various forms of propaganda and widely collecting signatures on the Stockholm Appeal.

　　"On the train, we saw slogans written on the walls of small houses along the road that said, 'Oppose American aggression against Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam.' The most frequent topic of conversation among the Chinese people at present is the liberation struggle of the Asian people.

　　"New Democratic China is beginning to enter a period of peaceful construction. The 475 million Chinese people are strongly united around the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, halting the aggressive actions of imperialists and warmongers. This is a huge contribution to the world peace and democracy camp."

　　Director Huang Mingzheng concluded forcefully:

　　"We, the Vietnamese people and youth, firmly believe that the victory of defending world peace is assured. The world peace and democracy camp is growing stronger day by day, and there is absolutely no doubt that the final victory belongs to us."

　　越南学生代表团斥美帝侵略行为
    赞扬中国人民反侵略行动对世界和平事业贡献巨大
    【本报讯】出席世界学生第二次代表大会的越南学生代表团，途经我国前往布拉格。二十二日下午三时，记者走访代表团团长黄明正，承发表谈话如下：
    “越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴于本月十五日曾发表声明斥责美国对朝鲜、中国和越南的侵略；越盟主席、越南国民联合会中央委员会主席黄国越坚决表示支持政府的声明，反对美国侵略并声援斗争中的朝鲜人民。这是代表全越人民的一致的态度与意见。
    “越南的青年与学生，自去年二月十一日反对殖民地制度斗争日以来，曾通过世界民主青联、民主学联号召的各种行动，表示了他们的反帝斗争决心，越南人民和全世界和平民主阵营争取和平的斗争紧密地连结在一起。
    “我以越南一切大中学生和二百五十万以上的青年代表的资格，对美国侵略朝鲜、台湾和越南表示无限的愤怒。”
    接着黄团长简单地叙述了他们代表团在中国停留半月及旅途上的印象。
    “中国民主青年组织及沿途各城市的青年曾非常关心我们并热情地招待，愿借此表示谢意。
    “在中国旅行时间虽然很短，我们目睹了中国人民与青年保卫世界和平决心的表示。我们正深深地体会到这一爱好和平的巨大的力量。在到达各地虽然很短的时间里，我们却看到许许多多青年以多种宣传方式向群众解释保卫世界和平的道理并广泛征集在斯德哥尔摩宣言上的签名。
    “在火车上，我们看到了路旁的小房子墙上写着‘反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜和越南’的标语。中国人民当前最经常的话题，都在关怀着亚洲人民的解放斗争。
    “新民主主义的中国正开始进入和平建设的时期。中国四万万七千五百万人民坚强的团结在以毛主席为首的中央人民政府的周围，喝止帝国主义和战争贩子的侵略行为，这对于世界和平民主阵营的贡献是巨大无比的。”
    黄明正团长最后有力地说：
    “我们越南人民和青年坚决相信，保卫世界和平的胜利是有把握的。世界和平民主阵营正日益强大，最后的胜利属于我们是绝无疑问的。”
