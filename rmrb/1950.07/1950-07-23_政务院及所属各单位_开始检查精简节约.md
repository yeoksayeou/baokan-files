　　The State Council of the Central People's Government and its affiliated commissions, ministries, associations, academies, administrations, and banks have mostly begun deploying and carrying out streamlining and thrift inspections. On the 17th, the State Council's Streamlining and Thrift Inspection Team held its second working meeting at the Central People's Supervisory Committee, attended by representatives from various units who reported on the progress of inspection work in their respective departments. According to information from the meeting, the various commissions, ministries, associations, academies, administrations, and banks have generally gone through deliberations and completed preliminary mobilization and organizational work. Some have already officially started inspections (such as the Supervisory Committee). The heads of various departments have mostly participated in the leadership themselves, and some have also absorbed representatives from the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union within the agencies. Organizationally, to integrate with the specific circumstances of each department, the departments have been divided into several inspection groups to carry out inspections separately. For example, the State Council is divided into four inspection groups: personnel establishment, real estate and furniture, construction and transportation, and expenditure and office expenses. The Supervisory Committee is divided into three groups: personnel organization and establishment, expenditure and food. When mobilizing, the departments under the Financial and Economic Committee particularly emphasized the positive significance of streamlining and thrift, and organized personnel from various units to study Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session, Lenin's "How to Organize Competition?" and Pravda's editorial on streamlining and thrift, in conjunction with the inspection work, and conducted discussions to improve everyone's understanding and eliminate the ideological concerns of some newly joined staff.

　　However, there are still individual departments that started later due to special circumstances, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which have not yet begun.

　　政务院及所属各单位
    开始检查精简节约
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院和政务院所属各委、部、会、院、署、行的精简节约检查工作，大部均已开始布置进行。十七日，政务院精简节约检查组假中央人民监察委员会召开了第二次工作会议，各单位代表出席报告了各部门关于检查工作的进行情形。据会上了解，各委、部、会、院、署、行一般都已经过酝酿，完成了初步的动员与组织工作，有的已经正式开始进行检查（如监察委员会）。各部门首长大都亲自参加了领导，有的并吸收了机关内的党、团、工会代表参加。在组织上，为结合各部门的具体情况，各部门又划分成若干检查小组分头检查，如政务院分为人事编制、房产家具、修建和交通工具、经费开支与办公用费四个检查小组，监察委员会分为人员机构编制、经费开支与伙食三个小组等。财经委员会所属各部门在进行动员时，特别强调精简节约的积极意义，并组织各单位人员结合检查工作，学习毛主席在三中全会的报告、列宁论《苏维埃机关工作人员应如何工作》以及真理报关于精简节约的社论等文件，并进行讨论，以提高大家的认识，并消除部分新参加工作人员的思想顾虑。
    但还有个别部门因特殊情况进行较晚，如外交部、内务部等尚未开始。
