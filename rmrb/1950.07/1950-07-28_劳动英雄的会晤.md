　　Meeting of Labor Heroes
    Bo Hai
    When Comrade Li Yong, Chinese Special-Class Hero, visited the Soviet Union, he made a special visit to Brazhenov, one of the founders of the "500-kilometer movement."
    Brazhenov is thirty-three years old. He drove his locomotive 500, 600, and even 700 kilometers in one day and night, thus saving the country 7 million rubles and earning the reputation of the best driver in the entire Soviet Union.
    After graduating from the factory apprentice school, he completed his first run on the locomotive himself at the age of eighteen. With the help of an experienced driver, he passed the examination for his qualifications to manage the locomotive independently. The Communist Youth League gave him the best Youth League locomotive.
    During the Great Patriotic War, he stayed with his locomotive day and night. Every time he brought the train to the station on time, he was always happy to think that Hitler's fierce bombing could not make the Soviet railway workers disrupt their train schedule.
    In 1943, Brazhenov was sent to the Central Technical Training Class of the Ministry of Communications to study.
    The war ended. Brazhenov worked at the Moscow-Soltsevo-Rechnaya station, painstakingly studying methods to increase locomotive speed. He brilliantly realized his ideal. Traveling 700 kilometers in one day and night gave great impetus to the 500-kilometer movement.
    Comrade Li Yong asked in surprise, "Does that mean you launched an extraordinary movement of Soviet people?"
    "No," he replied, "it was launched by Lenin. In May 1919, our railway workers held the first communist voluntary collective labor here. Lenin called it a 'great beginning.' He saw in the communist voluntary collective labor a seed of a new, socialist society and would give all the people a place to cultivate this seed—a place free from capitalism and rescued from the shackles of war."
    "I know Lenin's great instructions," Li Yong said, "Our leader Mao Zedong told us that my locomotive is named after him. But you have already walked a long way towards the sun, and we are only just beginning. I am very grateful for everything you have given me, my young teacher."
    The conversation between the two drivers continued for a long time. They talked about many important things. When parting, Li Yong gently patted his notebook with his palm and said:
    "I have a whole box of treasure here, given to me by you as if to a younger brother."

　　劳动英雄的会晤
    勃海
    中国特等英雄李永同志到苏联时，特地访问了“五百公里运动”的创始人之一——勃拉热诺夫。
    勃拉热诺夫三十三岁，他驾驶他的机车在一昼夜间行驶了五百、六百、乃至七百公里，因此为国家节省了七百万卢布，博得全苏联最好司机的名誉。
    当他在工厂艺徒学校毕业后，十八岁便自己完成了在机车上的首次驶行。他在老司机的帮助下，通过独自管理机车资历的考试。共产主义青年团把最好的青年团机车交给了他。
    伟大卫国战争时，他整天整夜不离机车，每一次当他将车辆准时带到站口时，他总是高兴地想着：希特勒的猛烈轰炸不能够使苏联铁路员工破坏自己的行车表。
    一九四三年勃拉热诺夫被送到交通部中央技术训练班去学习。
    战争结束了。勃拉热诺夫在莫斯科—索尔契罗沃赤纳雅工作站上工作中，苦心钻研了增加机车速度的方法。他辉煌地实现了他的理想。一昼夜行走了七百公里，给五百公里运动者以很大的刺激。
    李永同志惊喜地问了：“这就是说，你开展了一个苏维埃人的非凡的运动？”
    “不”，他答道，“它是列宁展开的。一九一九年五月里我们铁路员工在这里举行了第一次共产主义业余集体社会劳动。列宁把它叫做‘伟大的创举’。他在共产主义业余集体社会劳动里看见了一粒新的、社会主义社会的幼芽，并将带给全体人民以栽培这幼芽的园地——摆脱了资本主义和从战争枷锁中解救出来的园地。”
    “我知道列宁这些伟大的训示”，李永说：“我们的领袖毛泽东对我们说过，我的机车就冠着他的名字。但是您们已经朝着太阳走过了一大段路，而我们才仅仅开始。我很感谢您的一切，我的年轻的教师。”
    两位司机的谈话延续了很久。他们说了很多很重要的事情。分别时，李永用手掌轻轻地拍着笔记本说：
    “我这里有整箱的财宝了，是您象送给弟弟似地赠送给我的。”
