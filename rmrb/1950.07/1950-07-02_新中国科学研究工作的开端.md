The Beginning of Scientific Research in New China
    Our Reporter Bai Sheng

    In the eight months since the founding of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's scientific research work has begun to show a new look. First, the vast number of scientific workers have begun to unite and organize; the Academy of Sciences has adjusted the 23 research institutions it took over and established 15 new research institutions and three preparatory offices. More than 110 scientific experts in various fields have been recruited to serve as specialized committee members in each discipline. Scientific experts who were originally overseas, such as Vice President Li Siguang and Professor Hua Luogeng, have also returned one after another to serve the country's scientific construction. In order to enable scientific research work to better serve the people, many scientific workers are enthusiastically studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, including 33 scientific workers such as Shen Jiarui and Wu Bao San, who have participated in the studies at the Political Research Institute of the North China People's Revolutionary University.
    In terms of research methods and working methods, many scientific researchers have begun to combine laboratory research with the actual needs of national construction. For example, Zhu Hongfu, a researcher at the former Beijing Research Institute of Zoology, has, after long-term research and field investigations in rural areas of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, developed a method for preventing and controlling cotton aphids. They discovered that cotton aphids overwinter on the roots of more than a dozen weeds, the most important of which is the bitter lettuce (commonly known as bitter sesame vegetable). Therefore, if the bitter lettuce is uprooted before the cotton seedlings emerge, burned with fire, or buried deep in the ground, aphid damage can be greatly reduced and cotton production can be increased. Their research work has received full assistance from the People's Government. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has filmed their research and shown it in various places. At the same time, Zhu Hongfu was commissioned to write a special book entitled "A Brief Discussion on Cotton Aphid Prevention," which has begun to be promoted and adopted in rural areas of North China. Another example is that the former Shanghai Chemical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica accepted the commission of the East China Agricultural Science Institute to trial-produce two fungicides, ethyl mercuric chloride and ethyl mercuric phosphate, which have been successful. After being tested on farms by the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry, it was proved that they have a great inhibitory effect on the reproduction of cotton seedling blight bacteria, anthracnose bacteria, and red rot bacteria. Another example is that the former Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology of the Academia Sinica began to study the changes in the sowing seasons of various crops such as wheat, rapeseed, cotton, radish, and broad beans according to Lysenko's "vernalization method" in order to expand their planting areas and increase yields. The preliminary experimental research results are very good and have a great possibility of being applied in my country's agriculture. In order to solve the needs of national defense and the difficulties of domestic instruments, the former Beijing Institute of Physics has manufactured Panama-style artillery sights and stable radio wave crystal oscillators. The institute also co-sponsored a physical prospecting training class with the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry to train a group of talents who have begun to carry out physical prospecting and surveying in the Northeast. In addition, the former Beijing Chemical Research Institute accepted the commission of the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry to test the refining of Baotou natural alkali; the former Shanghai Institute of Medical Sciences of the Academia Sinica assisted the Songhu Garrison Command in improving the nutrition of commanders and fighters; the former Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica cooperated with the East China People's Pharmaceutical Company to study large-scale manufacturing of penicillin; and the Nanjing Geological Institute organized the Northeast Geological Survey Team to investigate geological minerals in the Northeast. Now there are preliminary gains. At the same time, the Academy of Sciences also organized the Northeast Scientific Expedition Team to investigate the actual situation of metallurgy, chemistry, medicine, biology, and other aspects in the Northeast, so as to further closely integrate the work of the Academy of Sciences with the work of national construction.
    Recently, various research institutions have formulated specific plans for future research work. In order to strengthen the connection between research institutions of various disciplines and scientific workers and to exchange scientific work experience at home and abroad, the Academy of Sciences began publishing the monthly "Science Bulletin" in May, and plans to publish two special issues of "Chinese Science" and "Science Records" in July and August respectively. At the same time, it has begun to establish contacts with scientific research institutions in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries; and has sent Wu Youxun, Hua Luogeng, and others to attend the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic in July. Within this year, it is also planned to send ten scientific workers to the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries for investigation and study.

### 新中国科学研究工作的开端

　　新中国科学研究工作的开端
    本报记者  柏生
    从中国科学院成立以来的八个月中，中国的科学研究工作已开始显露着新气象。首先，广大的科学工作者已开始团结起来和组织起来；科学院已将接管的二十三个研究机构调整后，建立了十五个新的研究机构和三个筹备处。罗致了一百一十多位各方面的科学专家，担任各科专门委员。原在海外的科学专家如李四光副院长、华罗庚教授等，也陆续归来为祖国的科学建设服务。许多科学工作者为使科学研究工作能更好地为人民服务，正在热烈地学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，其中沈嘉瑞、巫宝三等三十三位科学工作者并参加了华北人民革命大学政治研究院的学习。
    在研究方法和工作方法上，许多科学研究工作者已开始把实验室的研究工作与国家建设工作的实际需要结合起来。例如前北京研究院动物研究所的研究员朱弘复等，经长期研究并在河北、平原两省的农村中作了实地调查之后，已研究出防治棉蚜虫的办法。他们发现了棉蚜虫过冬时是潜伏在十几种杂草的根部上，其中最主要的一种就是苦荬菜（俗名苦麻菜）。因此，如果在棉苗出土以前将苦荬菜连根拔除，用火烧掉或深埋到地下去，就可以大大地减少蚜害，增加棉产。他们的研究工作获得人民政府的充分帮助，中央人民政府农业部已将他们研究的情形摄成电影，到各地放映，同时并委托朱弘复写成了“棉蚜预防浅说”专书，开始在华北农村中推广采用。又如前中央研究院上海化学研究所接受了华东农业科学研究所的委托，试制乙基氯化汞和乙基磷酸汞两种杀菌剂，已经成功，并经华东农林部在农场上试验，证明其对棉子立枯病菌、炭疽病菌和红腐病菌的繁殖有极大的抑制作用。又如前中央研究院上海植物研究所开始根据李森科的“春化法”，研究改变小麦、油菜、棉花、萝卜、蚕豆等多种农作物的播种季节，以扩大其种植地区，增加产量。初步实验研究结果，非常良好，且有很大可能应用在我国农业上。前北京物理研究所为了解决国防上的需要和国内仪器的困难，已制造了巴拿马式炮兵瞄准器和稳定无线电波的水晶振荡器。该所并与中央重工业部合办了物理探矿训练班，训练了一批人材，已开始到东北作物理探矿的勘测工作。此外，如前北京化学研究所接受了重工业部化工局的委托，试验包头天然碱的精制；前中央研究院上海医学研究所协助淞沪警备司令部改进指战员的营养；前上海药物研究所与华东人民制药公司合作，研究大规模制造盘尼西林；南京地质研究所组织了东北地质调查队去东北调查地质矿产；现在都已有初步收获。同时，科学院并组织了东北科学考察团，考察了东北冶金、化学、药物、生物等各方面的实际情况，以便进一步使科学院工作能与国家建设工作密切配合。
    最近，各研究机构都已制订了今后研究工作的具体计划。科学院为加强各科研究机关与科学工作者的联系，交流国内外科学工作经验，于五月份起出版了“科学通报”月刊，并计划在七八月分别出版“中国科学”和“科学纪录”两种专刊。同时，已与苏联和新民主主义国家的科学研究工作机构开始建立联系；并已派吴有训，华罗庚等四人出席七月间德意志民主共和国科学院成立二百五十周年的纪念会。本年内，还拟派遣十名科学工作者赴苏联及东欧各新民主主义国家考察和学习。
