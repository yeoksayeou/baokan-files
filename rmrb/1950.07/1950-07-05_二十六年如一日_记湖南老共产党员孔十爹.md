　　Twenty-Six Years as One Day
    ——Remembering Hunan’s Old Communist Party Member, Uncle Kong Shi
    By Our Correspondent Yao Liwen
    An Outstanding Representative of the Peasants of Hunan
    Uncle Kong Shi is an outstanding representative of the peasants of Hunan and a member of the Chinese Communist Party. His original name was Kong Fusheng, but the peasants affectionately call him Uncle Kong Shi. He lives in Mingdao Town, Changsha County. His grandfather and father worked as hired laborers their entire lives. He herded cattle for landlords from the age of eleven, and after three years became a hired laborer, working for twenty-eight years. His family was desperately poor. His younger brother developed a malignant sore on his face; a dose of medicine cost only forty copper coins, but they had no money to buy it. The prescription lay unused for half a month, and his younger brother died. His father contracted a seasonal epidemic; they found a prescription that cost only three hundred and sixty copper coins, but the landlord refused to lend them the money. His father died within a few days. Uncle Kong Shi said painfully, "Forty copper coins cost my brother his life, three hundred and sixty copper coins killed my father, it’s truly infuriating." In March 1925, Uncle Kong Shi joined the Party. After the "Ma-Ri Incident," the Kuomintang reactionaries carried out a bloody massacre of the peasants of Hunan, and some people wavered. Uncle Kong Shi, from the first day he joined the revolution, always persisted in his revolutionary post, for twenty-six years as if it were one day.
    A Talented Peasant Singer
    Uncle Kong Shi's twenty-six years of unyielding struggle is an epic worthy of song and tears. He himself is also a talented peasant singer. He never went to school and is illiterate, but he can turn his own personal experiences into a long, rhyming poem called "The Worker-Peasant Chronicle," profoundly expressing the suffering of the peasants.
    "Only the peasant toils to death,
    Eating a little chili and dried vegetables;
    Every day two bowls of sour vegetable soup,
    Straining his eyes upward;
    Wearing nothing but patched clothing,
    Sweat pouring down under the sun;
    Working a lifetime alone,
    The local tyrant marries several wives."
    He is filled with intense hatred and contempt for the landlord class. He said:
    "Exploiting the peasants is truly vicious,
    The landlords eat fish and meat;
    Eating duck and chicken every day,
    But what do you eat?
    Never lifting a finger to work but wanting to eat,
    Still exploiting the peasants."
    A long period of hired labor life made him aware of the cruel exploitation of the landlords. When he came into contact with the Party in 1925, he quickly accepted the Party's education and found the path for peasants to liberate themselves. On the eve of the Great Revolution, he used fighting songs to call upon and mobilize the peasants. He sang:
    "Unable to bear the landlord's oppression,
    Revolution is truly justified;
    Our way out is revolution,
    Fear not money, fear not death,
    Eliminate the warlords and bureaucrats,
    Overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry."
    Even before joining the revolution, although Uncle Kong Shi's own family was poor, he often helped poor brothers as long as he had money, and poor brothers often came to him when they were in trouble. He liked to fight for justice. When landlords and bullies did bad things, he posted "white road posters" on the streets and roads to scold them.
    The storm of the Great Revolution shook Hunan. At that time, Uncle Kong Shi was in the suburbs of Changsha, organizing and mobilizing peasants, and was elected as an executive committee member of the Changsha Suburban Peasants' Association. In 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries created the "Ma-Ri Incident," but failed to capture Uncle Kong Shi in the Suburban Peasants' Association. He then gathered peasants in Langli City to hold a meeting to discuss how to arm themselves. Unexpectedly, he was arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries and beaten half to death in prison. He did not say a single word of softness. Later, he got a chance to escape from danger and recuperated at the home of a friend in Taogong Temple. The reactionaries' frantic behavior did not frustrate Uncle Kong Shi's will, but only increased his hatred. As soon as he recovered from his injuries, he decided to look for He Long's troops to become a soldier. Several peasants and friends came to see him off. At parting, he sang four short verses to give great encouragement to those who came to see him off. The four short verses are:
    "Departing from Taogong Temple,
    Remembering Mingdao Township (site of the puppet government);
    Devoting myself to revolution,
    Returning home in victory."
    At the recent Hunan Provincial Peasants' Representative Conference, Wang Shoudao, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, praised Uncle Kong Shi, saying: "Comrade Kong Fusheng (Uncle Kong Shi) represents the Hunan peasants' strong fighting will and great revolutionary spirit. His poems are the wishes of the peasants at that time."
   To Engage in Revolution, One Must Not Talk About Three Things
    Born into a family of three generations of hired laborers, Uncle Kong Shi is full of a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. Under no circumstances has he ever been afraid of difficulties. He often tells other comrades that to engage in revolution, one must not talk about three things: first, do not talk about hardship (not afraid of hardship); second, do not talk about money (not greedy for wealth); third, do not talk about death (not afraid of sacrifice). This is his will, and it is also the manifestation of his actions over the past twenty-six years.
    In 1929, the Red Army was preparing to attack Changsha. The higher-ups asked Uncle Kong Shi to mobilize the peasants to respond to the main force outside the city. Uncle Kong Shi thought to himself that this action would lead to more deaths than survivors. Without mobilizing others, he arranged for his nephew (a Party member) to find a way to sneak into the city. Unexpectedly, the Red Army acted quickly and had already entered the city.
    The reactionaries' search for Uncle Kong Shi was very tight. His name was on the annual death lists. In addition, Uncle Kong Shi was short in stature and had a scar on his head. This prominent feature added to the difficulties of his activities. He had hoped to follow the Red Army to work in the army. The higher-ups said that Changsha was one of the important strongholds of the revolution and needed Uncle Kong Shi to persevere. Without hesitation, he gave up his personal thoughts and persevered in a very difficult situation.
    When Uncle Kong Shi was the secretary of the secret organization's district committee in Wangcheng District, Changsha County, he was once assigned by the higher-ups to perform an urgent task in the Xiangyin and Fengwan areas. He immediately braved the heavy rain, carrying an umbrella and taking two silver dollars for travel expenses. Because he was afraid of wasting time, he tightened his belt when he was hungry, and when he was very thirsty, he scooped up stream water with his hands to quench his thirst. As a result, he walked more than 120 li of muddy road in one day. He arrived at his destination that night. Uncle Kong Shi was already over sixty years old. Unless someone has lofty ideals and a full of revolutionary enthusiasm, who else could do this?
    Steadfast Confidence in Victory
    In extremely difficult and bleak years, steadfast confidence in victory is a feature of Uncle Kong Shi's revolutionary character.
    On August 1, 1927, Uncle Kong Shi arrived in Nanchang and participated in the famous Nanchang Uprising, and then fought in Jiangxi and Fujian. Uncle Kong Shi fought bravely in the army and was wounded twice. He came out of the Tingzhou Hospital in Fujian to go to Guangdong. The weather was hot and the road was long. The soldiers traveling with him had swollen feet. Some people missed their hometowns and their morale was low. He explained to the soldiers: "The revolution will be victorious, what does it matter to suffer a little bit?" He told the soldiers stories and sang clappers: "Traveling hundreds of miles a day, staying overnight in ancient temples, no matter what happens at home, it's good to settle down everywhere." The soldiers applauded, talked and laughed, and their morale rose.
    In Guangdong, the Revolutionary Army suffered losses. In June 1928, Uncle Kong Shi returned to Changsha. His brother Kong Nansheng cried and persuaded him: "There are still some people (referring to Communists), but there is no news of the revolution's success. You are getting old, forget it!" Uncle Kong Shi said angrily, "Do you think the revolution cannot be victorious? What is that supposed to mean!" After resting for one night, Uncle Kong Shi picked up his baggage and went to Liuyang to look for the guerrillas.
    Later, Uncle Kong Shi turned to the local area to do secret organization work among the peasants. Because of the emergency situation, he lived upstairs in the peasants' houses during the day and did not come out, and carried out activities at night. Sometimes the funds from the higher-ups were not available, so he relied on working as a hired laborer or selling water and other odd jobs to make a living. Life was very difficult. Once, he went to the home of his relative Zhang Siniu's wife in Xiangxiang County, carrying a broken umbrella, barefoot, and wearing a worn and patched outfit. Zhang Siniu's wife treated him very kindly. She talked to him intimately: "Look at you doing revolution like this, not eating well, not wearing well, do you regret it?" Uncle Kong Shi was very angry. He said: "Are you still afraid of hardship when you engage in revolution? I saw this a long time ago, what is there to regret?!" The next day, Uncle Kong Shi said goodbye and left. Zhang Siniu's wife wanted to give him twenty silver dollars for travel expenses, but he declined, and told Zhang Siniu's wife: "Engaging in revolution is not for personal gain. The strength of the workers and peasants is great, like the spring water in the mountains, it will never dry up. The revolution will be victorious sooner or later."
    A Person Loved by the Peasants
    Uncle Kong Shi is kind and sincere, and because he is very familiar with rural life, he can write clappers, tell jokes, and sing to the peasants. For example, the clapper about farming says: "If you work sloppily on ten 'shi' (a unit of dry measure) of land, it's better to work hard on one 'shi' of land; those who know how to work, work on one 'qiu' (a measure of land), those who don't know how to work, lose everything on the mountain." Some farmers like to raise pigs. What kind of pigs should they buy? Uncle Kong Shi sang: "Big mouth and big nostrils, sparse hair and thin skin, broad chest and visible nipples, it's cheaper to buy the expensive ones." Therefore, wherever Uncle Kong Shi went, the peasants, both men and women, young and old, all liked him very much.
    Uncle Kong Shi has the ability to approach the masses, spread revolutionary influence among the masses, and can also understand the suffering of the masses and use legal struggles to safeguard the interests of the working people. He was active in Wangcheng District, Changsha. The local landlords and rich peasants were very harsh on the peasants who worked odd jobs. No matter when they worked, they all waited until the end of the twelfth lunar month to pay their wages. If the rice was cheap, they would pay in rice, and if the rice was expensive, they would pay in money. Uncle Kong Shi took advantage of the busy "Yangchun" season to mobilize the odd job workers to ask their bosses to pay in rice as they worked. If they didn't agree, they wouldn't work. The bosses were forced to agree to the odd job workers' demands.
    The masses in the Xiangyin and Fengwan areas had to raise many trees every year to hand over to the Dike Affairs Bureau for dike repair; each time the dike was repaired, most of the trees were left over, and were taken away by the Dike Affairs Bureau officials for their own benefit. Next time the dike was repaired, the peasants would still provide trees, and a lot of wealth was wasted. Uncle Kong Shi mobilized the peasants to register the remaining tree materials for dike repair, and had someone threaten the Dike Affairs Bureau personnel: "The trees are the blood and sweat of everyone. Whoever steals the trees again, we will kill a few to show the monkeys." The trees were protected, and everyone praised Uncle Kong Shi for doing good things for them.
    A more intense struggle took place last year, just before liberation.
    A batch of "relief supplies" from the United States to aid Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was transported to Wangcheng District, Changsha. Most of it was swallowed by Kuomintang bureaucrats. The remaining nine hundred 'shi' of rice was used to form a "cooperative," which was headed by a villain named Li as the director. There were many flour milling sidelines in the local area. They only lent to wealthy families, but did not allow hard-working people with a lack of capital to borrow. The villain named Li embezzled more than a hundred 'shi' of grain himself. More than three hundred 'shi' of grain was stored in Gutangwan (Uncle Kong Shi lived in this village). The villain named Li heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to cross the Yangtze River, and wanted to transport the grain away and sell it. When this news reached Gutangwan, Uncle Kong Shi mobilized the local masses to protect the grain and prevent the villains from transporting it away. Some farmers asked: "I heard that the villain named Li is also bringing military police, what should we do?" Uncle Kong Shi strengthened everyone's confidence, saying: "The military police are not scary, we just want to eat 'relief grain', and we are not breaking the 'law'. With many people, they can't do anything." He actively acted separately, contacting the masses in nearby villages to protect the grain, and mobilizing no one to help the villains load and transport it.
    After waiting for two days, sure enough, the villain named Li drove a few small boats to transport the grain. He couldn't find anyone in the local area to transport it, so he had to let the few "basket carriers" he brought load the boat. When about twenty 'shi' of rice was loaded on the boat, the crowd protecting the grain gathered, a dark mass of five or six hundred people, holding spears in their hands, rushed up, some shouting to beat him, some shouting to reason with the villain named Li. The villain named Li saw that the masses were unanimously opposed and aggressive, and was so frightened that he didn't dare to show his face, so he sent someone to negotiate with the masses. Finally, both parties agreed on the conditions. The twenty 'shi' of rice that had been loaded on the boat was allowed to pass, and the villain named Li admitted that the remaining two hundred and eighty 'shi' of grain would be left to the local masses, and guaranteed that he would not retaliate in the future.
    Uncle Kong Shi is truly glorious.
    Last August, Hunan was peacefully liberated. On October 1, the people of the whole province warmly celebrated the birth of the new China. At the celebration meeting of tens of thousands of people in Changsha City, the old hired laborer of forty years (who also did hired labor discontinuously for more than ten years after joining the revolution) and the old revolutionary of twenty-six years – Uncle Kong Shi, appeared on the rostrum to speak: "Twenty-six years ago, I departed from Taogong Temple, the reactionaries were as fierce as tigers. Today, I have returned to Taogong Temple, recovered the revolutionary base, we have won. Victory is not easy, we must cherish our own country!" What words can be used to describe Uncle Kong Shi's joy? Uncle Kong Shi, who has experienced hardships and tasted all kinds of dangers, understands the meaning of victory even more!
    In March of this year, the Changsha County Peasants' Representative Conference was held, and the County Peasants' Association was established. The representatives unanimously elected Uncle Kong Shi as the vice chairman of the County Peasants' Association. When the peasants heard that Uncle Kong Shi had become the vice chairman of the Peasants' Association, they happily came to look for him. As long as he was in the office, there were always three or five peasants coming and going every day. Some wanted Uncle Kong Shi to help them solve the problems in rent reduction and rent refund, some came to visit their friend - Uncle Kong Shi. Some came from places more than ten li away, and some came from places more than tens of li away. Peasants from Xiangyin County, more than 120 li away, also came to visit him. As long as someone looked for Uncle Kong Shi, he would treat them kindly, chat with them about their families, and explain the new policies to his old friends and guests. One day, Liu Guisheng, who had worked as a hired laborer with Uncle Kong Shi forty years ago, came to visit him. Old friends reunited, the two old men were particularly happy. Liu Guisheng said: "It was really hard to work as a hired laborer in the past. This year, after the rent reduction, I got food grain, and I didn't have a hard time during the spring famine. It's really liberation." Uncle Kong Shi told him: "Now the working people are in charge of the world. The day we have been waiting for for decades has come." The more they talked, the more enthusiastic they became, and they talked for most of the day.
    The peasants of Changsha County elected Uncle Kong Shi as a representative to attend the first Hunan Provincial Peasants' Representative Conference. When electing the leaders of the Provincial Peasants' Association, Uncle Kong Shi was also elected as the vice chairman of the Provincial Peasants' Association.
    Glorious! Uncle Kong Shi. Glory should belong to those who work hard, diligently, and selflessly for the cause of the people.
    Let us read a passage of the liberation clapper that Uncle Kong Shi sang during the Provincial Peasants' Representative Conference.
    "The red flag is flying high and the magpies are calling, the peasant representatives have come to the province;
    Today we are holding the Peasants' Representative Conference, the working masses are welcome;
    There was no such good thing before, the oppression we suffered was unspeakable;
    Now the government belongs to the people, it is very glorious to be elected as a representative.
    The conference is lively, eight hundred representatives are of one heart,
    United as tightly as steel, the peasants of the world are one family;
    Establish the Provincial Peasants' Association, quickly rectify the team;
    Go back and lead the peasants, to carry out a thorough liberation."

　　二十六年如一日
    ——记湖南老共产党员孔十爹
    本报记者  姚力文
    湖南农民的优秀代表人物
    孔十爹是湖南农民的一位优秀代表人物，中国共产党党员。他的原名叫孔福生，农民们都亲慝地叫他孔十爹。他家住长沙县明道镇，祖父、父亲都当了一辈子雇工，他自十一岁上给地主看牛，过了三年改做雇工，一直做了二十八年。家里穷得干净。老弟脸上生了一个恶疮，一剂药只要四十文钱，但是没有钱买，把药方放了半个月，老弟死了；父亲得了时疫症，找到一个药方，只要三百六十文钱，想向地主去借，地主不理，不几天父亲也死了。孔十爹痛心的说：“四十文钱老弟丧命，三百六十文钱父亲死了，真是恼死人。”一九二五年三月，孔十爹加入了党。“马日事变”后，国民党反动派对湖南农民进行了血腥的屠杀，有些人动摇了；孔十爹从参加革命的第一天起，始终坚持着革命岗位，二十六年如一日。
    天才的农民歌手
    孔十爹二十六年不屈的斗争，是一部可歌可泣的史诗。他本人还是一个天才的农民歌手。他没有上过学，不识字，却能把自己的亲身经历，编成一首名叫“工农记”的顺口溜长诗。深刻地诉出了农民的苦痛。
    “只有农民累个死，
    吃点辣椒干菜子；
    每天两碗酸菜汤，
    梗得两眼往上翻；
    穿的尽是补钉衣，
    太阳晒得汗洗洗；
    累一世来打单身，
    土豪一讨几堂亲。”
    他对地主阶级充满着强烈的仇恨与轻蔑。他说：
    “剥削农民真恶毒，
    地主吃的鱼和肉；
    天天吃得鸭和鸡，
    倒看你吃的是那个的？
    四手不伸口要吃，
    ‘偕’（还）是剥削农民的。”
    长时期的雇工生活，使他认识了地主的残酷剥削，当他在一九二五年与党接近的时候，很快接受了党的教育，找到农民翻身的道路。他在大革命前夜即用战斗的歌句，号召动员农民。他唱道：
    “地主压迫受不起，
    革命真是有道理；
    我们的出路要革命，
    不要钱来不怕死，
    消灭军阀与官僚，
    土豪劣绅都打倒。”
    还在参加革命以前，孔十爹自家虽苦，只要有钱，常常帮助穷兄弟，穷兄弟有困难也常找他。他爱打“抱不平”，地主、恶霸做了坏事情，他在街头路旁贴“白路帖子”斥骂他们。
    大革命的风暴轰动了湖南，那时孔十爹在长沙近郊，组织与发动农民，被选为长沙郊区农协会执行委员。一九二七年国民党反动派制造“马日事变”，在郊区农协会没抓到孔十爹。他又在榔梨市集合农民开会，讨论如何武装起来。不提防被国民党反动派逮捕了，在监牢里被毒打得半死。他半句软话未讲，后来得机会逃出虎口，在陶公庙一个朋友家里养伤。反动派的疯狂行为，没有挫折孔十爹的意志，只是更增加了他的仇恨。伤刚好，他就决心找寻贺龙部队去当兵，有几个农民和朋友去送他，临别时，他唱了四句短诗，给送别的人以很大的鼓舞。四句短诗是：
    “动身陶公庙，
    记恨明道乡（伪政府住地）；
    倾心去革命，
    胜利再返乡。”
    在最近召开的湖南省农民代表大会上，湖南省人民政府王首道主席称赞孔十爹说：“孔福生（孔十爹）同志代表了湖南农民坚强的斗争意志与伟大的革命气魄，他的诗，就是当时农民的愿望。”
   干革命要三不讲
    三辈雇工出身的孔十爹，富有高度的革命热情，在任何情况下，他没有怕过困难。他常向别的同志讲，干革命要三不讲：一不讲苦（不怕吃苦）；二不讲钱（不爱财）；三不讲死（不怕牺牲）。这是他的意志，也是他二十六年来的行动表现。
    一九二九年红军准备进击长沙。上级让孔十爹发动农民到市内策应城外大军。孔十爹心里想，这一行动，死多活少，他没有动员别人，便约好他外甥（党员）设法混进城内。没想到红军行动迅速，已打进城内来了。
    反动派捉拿孔十爹的风声很紧，每年杀人的黑名单上都有他。再加上孔十爹个子矮，脑袋上有疤，这一个显著特征，更增添了活动的困难。他曾希望随红军去作部队工作。上级说长沙是革命重要据点之一，需要孔十爹坚持。他毫没犹豫的放弃私念，在十分困难的境遇下，安心坚持下来了。
    孔十爹在长沙县望城区当秘密组织的区委书记时，曾有一次上级分配他到湘阴和丰垸一带担任紧急任务，他立刻冒着大雨，他打一把伞，拿着两块银洋的路费出发了。因为怕耽误时间，肚子饿了就紧紧腰带，渴得厉害，用手捧一下溪水解渴。结果，他一天走了一百二十多里的泥泞道。当晚就到达了目的地。孔十爹已是六十多岁的人了，除非具有崇高理想和满腔革命热情的人，谁还能这样做呢？
    顽强的胜利信心
    在极端困苦的、黯淡的岁月里，对胜利有顽强的信心，这是孔十爹革命性格的一个特色。
    一九二七年八月一日孔十爹到了南昌，参加了著名的南昌暴动，随后又转战江西福建。孔十爹在军中作战勇敢，负过两次伤。他从福建汀州医院里出来去广东，天热路长，同行的战士们，脚都磨肿了，有些人思念起家乡，情绪低落，他向战士们解释道：“革命会胜利，吃点苦算什么。”他向战士们讲故事，唱快板：“日行百数里，夜宿古寺亭，不管家中事，到处好安身。”战士们拍手叫好，有说有笑，情绪高起来了。
    在广东，革命军遭受了损失。一九二八年六月孔十爹回到长沙，他的哥哥孔南生哭着劝他：“人（指共产党员）还有一部分，革命成功没得音，你年纪大了，算了吧！”孔十爹气愤地说：“你认为革命不能胜利吗？这算什么话！”歇了一个晚上，孔十爹背起包袱，到浏阳找寻游击队去了。
    后来，孔十爹又转入地方，做秘密组织农民的工作。因情况紧急，白天住在农民的楼上不出来，晚上进行活动，有时上级的经费接济不上，便靠自己当长工，或挑卖水等杂活来维持，生活很困苦。有次，他去湘乡县亲戚张四牛婆家里，打一把破伞，赤着脚，穿一身破补钉的衣裳。张四牛婆很亲切的招待他。和他谈知心话：“看你革命革咯（这）个样子，吃没吃得，穿没穿得，悔也不悔？”孔十爹很生气，他说：“干革命还怕苦吗？这是早就看到的，有什么事可悔？！”第二天，孔十爹告别就走，张四牛婆要送他二十块银洋作路费，他谢绝了，并告诉张四牛婆：“干革命，不是为个人打算，工人农民的力量多，像山上的泉水，是流不干的，革命迟早会胜利的。”
    农民喜爱的人
    孔十爹为人和气诚恳，又因为他对农村生活很熟悉，会编快板，讲笑话，说唱给农民们听。比如，关于种田的快板有：“马马虎虎作十石（田），不如下力作一石（田）；会作的作一丘，不会作的满山丢。”有些农民喜欢养猪，买什么样的猪好呢？孔十爹唱：“嘴大鼻孔大，稀毛又薄皮，膛开（阔）又显奶，贵买得便宜。”因之，孔十爹走到那里，那里的农民们不论男女老少，都很喜爱他。
    孔十爹有接近群众的本领，在群众中散布革命影响，还能体贴群众的疾苦，利用合法斗争，来维护劳苦群众的利益。他在长沙望城区活动，当地的地主富农对做零工的农民很苛刻，不管什么时候做工，都推到腊月底才发工资，如果米贱便发米，米贵了便发钱。孔十爹趁“阳春”忙活的时候，发动零工们向自己的东家要求随做工随发现米，不答应便不做活。东家们被迫答应了零工们的要求。
    湘阴和丰垸一带的群众，每年都要筹集许多树木，交堤务局修堤；每次修堤常剩下大半树木，被堤务局主管人员运走自肥，下次修堤时，农民们还照样出树木，资财浪费很大。孔十爹动员农民们把修堤剩余的树木材料进行登记，并让人扬言威胁堤务局人员：“树是大家的血汗，谁再偷树，杀他几个给猴子看。”树保护住了，大家称赞孔十爹给他们办了好事情。
    比较激烈的一次斗争，是在去年快解放时。
    美帝援助蒋匪的“救济物资”，曾有一批运至长沙望城区，大部被国民党的官僚吞没了，剩下九百多石稻谷，组成个“合作社”，由一个姓李的坏蛋当理事长。当地磨粉副业很多，他们只借给有钱的人家，缺少本钱的劳苦人，却不准借。姓李的本人贪污了百多石谷，有三百多石谷存放在古塘湾（孔十爹住在此村），姓李的坏蛋听说解放军快渡长江，要把谷子运走卖掉。这消息传到古塘湾，孔十爹便发动当地群众护粮，不让坏蛋运走。有的农民提出：“听说姓李的还带宪兵来，怎么办？”孔十爹坚定大家的信心，他说：“宪兵不可怕，我们只是要吃‘救济粮’，又不犯‘法’，人多势众他没办法。”积极分头活动，一面串通附近村群众来护粮，动员谁也不帮坏蛋装运。
    等了两天，果真姓李的驶着几只小船来运谷了。本地找不到人搬运，只好让带来的几个“箩脚子”（搬运夫）装船，约有二十石米装上船的时候，护粮的人群聚齐了，黑压压的五六百人，手中拿着标枪，一拥而上，有的人喊打，有的人嚷着要给姓李的讲理。姓李的坏蛋见群众一致反对，气势汹汹，吓得不敢露面，遂派人和群众交涉，最后双方讲好条件，已装船的二十石米放行，剩下的二百八十石谷，姓李承认留给当地群众，并保证今后不报复。
    孔十爹真是光荣啊
    去年八月，湖南和平解放。十月一日，全省人民热烈庆祝新中国的诞生。在长沙市数万人的庆祝大会上，四十年的老雇工（参加革命后又断续做了十多年）、二十六年的老革命——孔十爹，出现在大会主席台上讲话了：“二十六年前，我动身陶公庙，反动派凶如猛虎，今天，我又回到陶公庙，收复革命根据地，我们胜利了。胜利可不容易，我们要十分爱护我们自己的国家！”用什么字句来形容孔十爹的欢欣呢？历经困苦、备尝艰险的孔十爹更懂得胜利的意义啊！
    今年三月，开长沙县农民代表大会，产生县农协会，代表们以全票选举孔十爹为县农协会副主席。农民们听说孔十爹当了农协会副主席，都高兴的来找他。只要他在机关里，每天总有三、五个农民来往。有的是让孔十爹帮他解决减租退租中的问题，有的是来探望他们的朋友——孔十爹，有从十几里的地方来的，有数十里以外来的，相距一百二十余里的湘阴县农民也来探望他了。只要有人找孔十爹，他都是亲切的招待他们，拉着家常，向老友们客人们解释新政策。有一天，四十年以前和孔十爹在一块当过雇工的刘桂生来探望他了。老友重会，两个老人格外高兴。刘桂生说：“过去当长工是真苦啊，今年减租，我得了果实粮，春荒也没作难，真是翻身了。”孔十爹告诉他：“现下劳动人民掌天下了，几十年望着的一天来到了。”越谈越热，一直谈了大半天。
    长沙县的农民，选举孔十爹为出席湖南省第一届农民代表会的代表；在选举省农协领导人的时候，孔十爹又当选为省农协副主席。
    光荣啊！孔十爹。光荣是应该属于为人民事业，辛勤、刻苦、忘我奋斗的人的。
    让我们读一段，省农代会开会期间，孔十爹唱的翻身快板吧。
    “红旗飘飘喜鹊叫，省里来了农代表；
    今日召开农代会，劳苦群众受欢迎；
    以前那有这好事，受的压迫说不清；
    如今政府属人民，当选代表多光荣。
    大会开起真热闹，八百代表一条心，
    团结紧紧如钢铁，天下农民一家人；
    成立全省农协会，快把队伍来整顿；
    回去带动众农民，搞个彻底大翻身。”
