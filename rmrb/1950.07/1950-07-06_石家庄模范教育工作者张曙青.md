　　Shijiazhuang Model Educator Zhang Shuqing
    Yang Yifan
    Comrade Zhang Shuqing is the principal of Shijiazhuang Municipal No. 2 Middle School. He is a Communist Party member beloved by the masses.

    Since he founded the Second Middle School in 1948, he has firmly grasped the direction of serving workers and peasants. In each new student enrollment, he always gives priority to the children of workers and peasants. Currently, the children of workers and peasants account for over 78% of the total number of students in the Second Middle School.

    Comrade Zhang Shuqing shows the greatest concern for the political progress of every cadre. He can implement the policy of uniting and transforming old intellectuals. Comrade Li Zhichao, the teaching affairs cadre and music teacher, is a good example. When Li Zhichao first transferred to the Second Middle School the year before last, he was considered the most backward teacher. However, under Principal Zhang's patient education, Li Zhichao made rapid progress. Last December, he was elected as a model in the school and was honorably approved to join the Communist Youth League.

    Principal Zhang is very caring towards the students. On the one hand, he cares about the students' studies and their health, and on the other hand, he pays attention to the students' ideological and political education. He is the secretary of the General Party Branch of the Second Middle School. Under his leadership, nearly fifty Party members and nearly three hundred Communist Youth League members have been developed among the students in the past two years. They have all become the backbone of the learning mutual aid organizations in each class, ensuring the completion of learning tasks.

    Through cadre study and work summaries, Principal Zhang widely and deeply solicits the opinions of the masses, and conscientiously conducts criticism and self-criticism. This enables all cadres and students in the school to consciously abide by various work systems and study life disciplines.

    In order to promote labor, he led the school in planting more than one mu of vegetables and established a small chalk factory, supplying chalk to the school and two or three other primary and secondary schools. In addition, he mobilized cadres, students, and workers to repair walls, level the playground, and repair sidewalks during their spare time, saving more than 2,800 jin of wages and rice in April and May alone, and using the money saved to purchase books and instruments. Last year, he personally led all teachers and students to participate in repairing 2,000 meters of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, winning the banner of "Model for Protecting the People's Railway" from the Railway Bureau and the Railway Trade Union. Therefore, Comrade Zhang Shuqing was elected as a model worker in the Second Middle School twice last year and this year. On June 18 this year, the city's secondary schools held a model election conference, and he was awarded the honorary title of Shijiazhuang Model Educator.

　　石家庄模范教育工作者张曙青
    杨一凡
    张曙青同志是石家庄市立第二中学的校长。他是一个获得群众热爱的共产党员。
    他从一九四八年创办二中起，就紧紧掌握了面向工农的方针。每次招考新生时，他总是尽先录取工农子弟。目前该校工农子弟在二中已占学生总数的百分之七十八强。
    张曙青同志对每个干部的政治进步，都寄予最大的关心。他对旧知识分子能贯彻团结改造的方针。教导干事兼音乐教员李志超同志就是一个很好的例子。前年李志超开始调到二中时，被人认为是最落后的教员。但在张校长的耐心教育下，李志超很快地获得了进步。在去年十二月他即在学校中被选为模范，并光荣地被批准参加了青年团。
    张校长对于学生是很爱护的，他一方面关心学生的学习及学生的健康，另一方面又注意学生的思想政治教育。他是二中党的总支书记。在他的领导下两年来在同学中发展了近五十人的党员和近三百人的青年团员。他们都成为各班学习互助组织的骨干，保证着学习任务的完成。
    通过干部学习及工作总结，张校长广泛而深入地征求群众的意见，认真地进行批评和自我批评。使全校干部及同学都能自觉地遵守各种工作制度及学习生活纪律。
    为了提倡劳动，他领导全校栽种了一亩多蔬菜，创办了一个小型粉笔制造厂，供给本校及其他两三个中小学使用。此外他还发动干部、同学及工友在课余工余修墙、平操场、修甬路，只四、五两月份即节省工资米二千八百余斤，并用这些节省下来的钱添购了图书仪器。去年，他曾亲自带领全体师生参加修整京汉路两千公尺，获得路局和铁路工会的“爱护人民铁路的模范”的锦旗。因此张曙青同志在去年和今年曾两度当选为二中模范工作者。今年六月十八日，全市中等学校举行表模选举大会，他又获得石家庄市模范教育工作者的光荣称号。
