Several Problems in the Work of People's Schools in Songjiang Province
　　Special Correspondent of this newspaper Wang Xiyao

　　Recently, we investigated the situation of the farmers' literacy campaign in Acheng, Hulan, and Fangzheng counties, and discovered several problems that need to be solved quickly. We specifically raise them for everyone to study and improve.

　　On the basis of 500,000 farmers attending winter school in Songjiang Province last year, this year, 3,187 people's schools and 30,566 literacy groups have been established, with more than 350,000 people participating in regular learning. After the winter school was transformed into a year-round learning organization, the farmers' enthusiasm for learning is generally very high. Many villages use blackboard newspapers, radio stations, and other means to promote the literacy campaign and create a "Thousand Character Chart" to help everyone learn, creating a strong atmosphere of learning in the countryside. Now is the busy season of summer hoeing, and most people's schools have adopted the form of combining production with decentralized learning. Most villages have organized local elementary school students to act as "little teachers" and "send characters" to farmers who are learning in a decentralized manner every day. This method has been done very well in some places and has achieved considerable success. For example, in Acheng city, some students of the people's school call the elementary school students "wireless radios with legs," which is very popular among farmers.

　　The leadership of the farmers' literacy campaign in various places is generally quite attentive, but after the provincial vocational and amateur education conference was held on June 9, some educational administrative leaders developed some misunderstandings. That conference was specifically to study how to carry out the workers' literacy campaign. Not much was said about the issue of farmer education. Some comrades even developed the idea that "workers' education is more important, and farmers' education doesn't matter so much." Now, some counties are vigorously carrying out vocational and amateur education for workers, and have relaxed the leadership of farmer education, ignoring the farmers' literacy campaign. This is a one-sided work style. It is completely correct to attach importance to workers' education, but we cannot relax the education of farmers, who account for the vast majority of the current population. Songjiang Province has done a lot of work on farmer education, spent a lot of effort, and achieved considerable success. More than 350,000 people have persisted in year-round learning, and have basically dispelled many of the farmers' concerns about learning. Existing achievements must be persisted in and consolidated, so that existing students can achieve the goal of recognizing a thousand characters by the end of the year, in order to lay the foundation for this year's illiteracy eradication work.

　　Due to the relaxation of leadership, the learning of farmers in some areas has now fallen into an unplanned state: for example, organizing elementary school students to send characters is neither arranged nor checked, but simply asks the elementary school students to send three characters a day. Therefore, elementary school students do not distinguish between objects when sending characters, nor do they have fixed objects, and teach whoever they meet. The characters sent are also randomly selected by the elementary school students, which cannot meet the needs of the masses - those with a higher level of education feel dissatisfied, and those with a lower level cannot accept it. There is no inspection afterwards; whether the characters have been sent, whether the students have learned them, are all unknown. This situation needs to be improved. Elementary school students sending characters should be managed by elementary school teachers or mass teachers; a certain plan should be made; each elementary school student should be fixed to send characters to those students of the people's school; and what content should be "sent" according to the existing level of the students. The leadership conducts regular inspections or spot checks to understand the learning effect; elementary school students who do a good job should be encouraged and commended to improve their enthusiasm. Only in this way can the sending of characters not become a mere formality. At the same time, the county and district leaders should now consider the learning plan during the weeding period. Because the situation varies from place to place, some places are relatively idle after weeding and can concentrate on learning for a period of time; other areas (such as those planting tobacco in mountainous areas) are still very busy during the weeding period and can only continue to learn in a decentralized manner. These must be fully researched and prepared in advance.

　　In addition, in order to urge farmers to learn, many areas in Songjiang have set up "literacy sentry posts." The sentry posts are hung with literacy signs, and elementary school students or women are on guard. Farmers passing by must recognize the characters on the literacy signs or learn the character on the spot before they can pass. This method is a form of coercion and command, forming a burden on the masses. Some masses have already felt dissatisfied; at the same time, the elementary school students or women on guard do not patiently teach the masses to read, but rudely question the masses. Therefore, there have been incidents of passing masses beating elementary school students in some places; some farmers, in order to avoid the "literacy sentry posts," do not hesitate to take detours, which delays production during the busy farming season. This method should be abolished and replaced by other methods that can inspire farmers' initiative to learn.

　　松江省民校工作中的几个问题
    本报特约通讯员  王希尧
    最近我们在阿城、呼兰、方正等县调查了农民识字运动的情况，发现了几个需要迅速解决的问题，特提出来供大家研究改善。
    松江省在去年五十万农民上冬学的基础上，今年建立了三千一百八十七处民校和三万零五百六十六个识字小组，参加经常学习的群众在三十五万人以上。冬学转为常年学习组织后，农民的学习情绪一般都很高。许多村庄利用黑板报、广播台等推动识字运动，并制出“千字表”来帮助大家学习，造成了农村中浓厚的学习空气，现在正是农忙的夏锄季节，一般民校都采取结合生产，分散学习的形式。大部分村庄都组织了当地小学生当小先生，每天为分散学习的农民“送字”。这种方式有的地方作得很好，获得了相当成绩。如阿城城区有的民校学员把小学生们叫做“一帮带腿的无线电”，很受农民欢迎。
    各地对农民识字运动的领导一般都是相当重视的，但在六月九日召开了全省职工业余教育会议以后，一部分教育行政领导干部发生了某些误解。那次会议是专门研究如何开展职工识字运动的，对农民教育问题谈得不多，有的同志竟因此产生了“还是工人教育重要，农民教育差一点算不了什么”的思想。现在有的县份在大力进行职工业余教育中，竟放松了农民教育的领导，对农民识字运动不闻不问。这是一种片面的工作作风。重视工人教育是完全正确的，但不能因而放松了占当前人口绝大多数的农民教育。松江省对农民教育已做了很多工作，费了很大力量，获得了相当成绩，已有三十五万余人坚持常年学习，基本上已打消了农民学习的许多顾虑。已有的成绩必须坚持、巩固，使现有学员到年底能达到识一千字的目标，以为今年扫除文盲工作打下基础。
    由于领导的放松，现在有的地区农民学习陷入了无计划状态：如组织小学生送字，既没有布置，也不检查，只是叫小学生每天送三个字就了事。所以小学生送字时不分对象，也没有固定的对象，遇到谁就教给谁。所送的字也是由小学生随便挑选的，不能适合群众的需要——文化程度高一些的感觉不满意，低的接受不了。事后也没有检查；送了没有，学员学会了没有，都不知道。这种情况需要改善。小学生送字应由小学教师或群众教师掌握；作出一定的计划；固定每个小学生给那些民校学员送字；并根据学员已有程度计划要“送”些什么内容。领导上定期检查或抽查，以了解学习效果；对工作好的小学生应鼓励、表扬，提高他们的积极性。这样才能使送字不致流于形式。同时，县、区领导上现在就应该考虑挂锄期间的学习计划。因为各地情况不同，有的地方挂锄以后比较闲，可以集中学习一段时期；有的地区（如山地种烟的）挂锄期间仍是很忙，还只能继续分散学习。这些都要事先作充分的研究和准备。
    此外，松江许多地区为了督促农民学习，设立了“识字岗哨”。岗哨上挂着识字牌，由小学生或妇女站岗，过路的农民必须认识识字牌上的字或当场学会那个字才能通过。这种方法是强迫命令的形式，形成群众的一种负担，有的群众已感到不满；同时站岗的小学生或妇女也不是耐心地去教群众识字，而是生硬地质问群众。因此有的地方发生过过路群众殴打小学生的事件；有的农民为了躲避“识字岗哨”，不惜绕道，这样，在农忙时反而耽误了生产。这种方法应该取消，而代之以其他能够启发农民学习自觉性的方法。
