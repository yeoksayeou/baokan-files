　　Government Vigorously Adjusts Public-Private Relations
    Shijiazhuang Breaks Sales Stagnation
    Shutdowns Cease Since June
    [Our newspaper's Baoding dispatch] Under a series of measures by the government to adjust public-private relations and support legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises, industry and commerce in Shijiazhuang City have shifted from the difficult situation since March and are moving towards improvement.

    The difficulties encountered by industry and commerce in Shijiazhuang after March were mainly a sluggish market, few transactions, and inflexible capital turnover, leading to an increase in the number of shutdowns. Some private industrialists and businessmen lost confidence in their operations, with some saying, "Better to shut down sooner than later," and "Better to sit and eat than lose money by working." As of the end of May, there were 1,188 private industrial enterprises and 2,273 commercial enterprises in the city. After adjustment and support by the Municipal People's Government, the city's private industrial and commercial enterprises have gradually overcome temporary difficulties and achieved normal development. Market transactions and the exchange of industrial and agricultural products are also becoming more active. The city's ironware products in March were only 164,000 catties, while sales in May reached 470,000 catties (most of the spring stock was sold, thus having the ability to engage in reproduction); 1,750 bolts of white cloth were sold in March, which increased to 4,152 bolts in May; daily sales of grain in March were about 10,000 catties, while in May they reached more than 200,000 catties; the daily sales of wheat grain to rural areas now exceeds 1,000 bags, breaking the past daily sales record. The seven state-owned specialized companies had a daily currency return of only 30 to 40 million yuan in March, which exceeded twice that amount in early June. The normal flow of products has promoted the gradual improvement of industry. According to the statistics of the cloth industry, the increased output in May exceeded 140% of that in March.

    The state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company also provided support through entrusted processing, enabling more than 70% of all iron, wood, motor, and weaving factories in the city to resume operations. The larger Daxing Yarn Factory has been able to fully utilize its existing equipment and maintain regular production since undertaking processing, and its profits have far exceeded those during the period of independent operation and sales, exceeding 300 million yuan in May. Therefore, the factory owner has the confidence to expand production and is now actively repairing houses and adding machinery. The Railway Factory ordered more than 30,000 catties of parts from the iron industry, with only the processing rice. The People's Bank issued loans of nearly 10 billion yuan in May, supporting the iron, oil pressing, weaving, kiln, and wood industries. After the iron industry received a loan of 60 million yuan, it solved the difficulty of inflexible capital turnover. Handicraft industries such as knitting, ironware, and woodwork organized joint operations and sales to solve the difficulties of insufficient manpower and small capital. The knitting industry also opened up sales channels in Taiyuan, Yuci, and other places due to the organization of joint operations.

    In early June, the city further adjusted the scope of operations of public-private commerce and cooperatives, grasped reasonable price differences, and implemented price policies. State-owned trade departments took the initiative to reduce the scope of retail sales, with retail stores reduced from thirty to twenty-two. It is tentatively decided to operate five major daily necessities: cotton yarn, cloth, grain, coal, salt, and kerosene, and to operate department store items such as towels, socks, alkaline noodles, and sugar, and simplify business procedures, grasp the reasonable difference between wholesale and retail prices, so that legitimate private businesses can profit. After entering June, no shutdowns have been reported. Some of the households that had shut down in the past have resumed operations, and some are preparing to resume operations.

    In order to rapidly promote the adjustment of public and private commerce and improve public-private relations, the city also established a Public-Private Adjustment Committee under the leadership of the Municipal Finance Committee, responsible for solving public-private relationship issues arising in the scope of operations, raw material supply, sales market, lending relationships, and processing, ordering, and joint venture businesses.

　　政府大力调整公私关系
    石家庄打破滞销局面
    六月以来歇业现象已经停止
    【本报保定讯】在政府调整公私关系、扶植正当私营工商业的一系列措施下，石家庄市工商业，已由三月份以来的困难局面，走向好转。
    石市工商业，三月份以后碰到的困难，主要是市场呆滞，成交稀少，资金周转不灵，因而歇业户增多。部分私营工商业者失去经营信心，有的说：“迟歇不如早歇”，“干着赔不如坐着吃”。截至五月底止，全市私营工业计有一千一百八十八户，商业二千二百七十三户。经过该市人民政府调整和扶植以后，该市私营工商业已逐渐度过暂时困难，得到正常的发展。市场交易和工农业产品交流，亦日见活跃。全市三月份铁货产品仅十六万四千斤，而五月份销出就达到四十七万斤（春季存货大部卖出，因而有了从事再生产的能力）；三月份推销白布一千七百五十匹，五月则增到四千一百五十二匹；三月份粮食日销一万斤左右，五月份则已达二十余万斤；麦粮现日销农村一千余袋，打破了过去的日销纪录。七个国营专业公司，三月份每天回笼货币仅三千至四千万元，六月初就超过三月份的两倍。由于产品流转正常，促使工业逐渐好转。按布业的统计，五月份增产量已超过三月份的百分之一百四十。
    国营花纱布公司又通过委托加工加以扶植，使全市所有铁木电机织布工厂恢复了百分之七十以上。规模较大的大兴纱厂自承揽加工后，能充分利用现有设备而经常生产，获利已远超过自营自销时期，五月份已逾三亿多元。因此厂主有了扩大生产的信心，现在积极修整房屋添设机器。铁路大厂向铁工业订购机件，只加工米即达三万多斤。人民银行五月份发放贷款近一百亿元，扶助了铁工、榨油、织布、窑业、木器等行业。铁工业得到六千万元贷款后，解决了该业资金周转不灵的困难，手工业者如针织、铁业、木器等行业组织了联营联销解决了人力不足、资金短小的困难，针织业由于举办联营还打开了太原、榆次等地的销路。
    六月初该市更进一步调整了公私商业及合作社的经营范围，掌握了合理的物价差额，贯彻了价格政策。国营贸易部门主动缩小零售范围，零售店已由三十个减为二十二个。暂定经营纱布、粮食、煤炭、食盐、煤油五种主要日用必需品，附带经营毛巾、袜子、碱面、糖等百货，并简化营业手续，掌握批发价格与零售价格的合理差额，使正当私商有利可图。进入六月后，已没有呈报歇业的。过去歇业的户有的已经复业，有的准备复业。
    该市为迅速推进调整公商业改善公私关系，在市财委会领导下，还设立了公私调整委员会，负责解决经营范围，原料供给，销售市场，借贷关系上以及加工、订货、合营等业务间，所发生的公私关系问题。（惠生）
