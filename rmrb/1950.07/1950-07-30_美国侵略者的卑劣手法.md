　　The American Aggressors' Despicable Methods
    Li Siguang
    Enticement, threat, and deception are probably the most despicable of all the base behaviors in human society. Today, American imperialism relies entirely on these three methods to carry out aggression in the world. What is the tool of enticement? The dollar. What is the tool of threat? The atomic bomb and the super-fortress. Despite all the propaganda of American imperialism, the experience of the past few years has proven that dollars cannot buy the hearts of all people in the world, and atomic bombs cannot destroy the bulwark of peace. Now it is playing the third trick to deceive the world. That is to make the United Nations its own tool at all costs. It tramples on Korea, but says that the Koreans are the aggressors; it uses warships and planes to directly interfere in China's affairs, let's see if it can say that this is an act of Chinese aggression! Know that such a reversal of right and wrong cannot hide its sins; on the contrary, it only arouses the anger of the vast and just people of the world, this anger is power, and this power is not afraid of any super-fortresses and atomic bombs. Korea will always be the Korea of the Korean people, and Taiwan will always be the land of the people's China. What we want is neither more nor less than this. This is our determination.

　　美国侵略者的卑劣手法
    李四光
    利诱，威胁，欺骗，恐怕要算人类社会里种种卑劣行为中的最卑劣的。美帝国主义今天在世界上进行侵略，就全靠这三种手段。利诱的工具是什么？美元。威胁的工具是什么？原子弹和超级空中堡垒。尽管美帝国主义用尽一切的宣传，过去几年的经验已经证明了：美元买不尽天下的人心，原子弹也毁不了保卫和平的堡垒。现在它正在玩弄第三种手段，来欺骗世界。这就是不顾一切，硬要把联合国做成他御用的工具。它蹂躏朝鲜，反而说朝鲜人是侵略者；它用兵船和飞机来直接干涉中国的事务，我们且看他能不能说这是中国侵略的行为！要知道这样颠倒是非，并不能掩饰它的罪恶；相反的，徒徒引起了全世界广大的公正民众的愤怒，这种愤怒就是力量，这种力量决不怕任何超级空中堡垒和原子弹的。朝鲜永远是朝鲜人民的朝鲜，台湾也永远是人民中国的土地。我们所要的不比这多一点，也不能比这少一点。这是我们的决心。
