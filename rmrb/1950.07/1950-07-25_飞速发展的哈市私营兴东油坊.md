　　Rapidly Developing Private Xingdong Oil Mill in Harbin
    Li Jun
    The private Xingdong Oil Mill in Harbin, which has expanded its business tenfold in the past three years, built a large warehouse of two thousand square meters in 1949, capable of holding two hundred train cars of soybeans. Who cultivated the capitalist's ambition to expand the factory's business? An old oil mill mechanic of twenty-nine years told us: "The fact that capitalists are so eager to do business these days is not only due to the leadership of the People's Government but also the promotion of the workers." He cited a fact: On June 24th last year, a fire broke out in the factory warehouse. Initially, the manager watched with tears as his hard-earned business was about to turn to ashes, but over a hundred workers immediately rushed into the fire, climbed onto the roof, and risked their lives to save the factory's property, without a single person looking after their own belongings. At that time, the factory's cash was only enough for expenses, and the workers suggested to the capitalist that wages be paid later to repair the warehouse first; the government also allocated soybeans for processing and paid the processing fee in advance to facilitate the turnover of funds.
    During the Japanese occupation, the equipment of Xingdong Oil Mill was quite rudimentary. The factory was bordered by wooden fences, and the wooden warehouse lacked fire prevention and soybean warming equipment, capable of holding only seven train cars of beans. The rest were piled in the courtyard, exposed to the sun and rain. The courtyard was muddy, the dormitories were damp, and the windows were papered. The capitalist went through the years without any real planning. When repairing the chimney, they used one-and-a-half-point iron plates, unwilling to use two-point iron plates, even though the price difference was limited, but the two-point plates would last ten years longer than the one-and-a-half-point plates. Today, Xingdong Oil Mill has red brick walls outside the yard, stone roads inside the yard, and rows of brand-new red brick buildings, covering an area of seven thousand square meters. The newly built large oil storage tank is thirteen meters high and ten meters in diameter, holding two million catties of oil. Near the red brick warehouse are a club and worker dormitories. They also renovated the large boiler and machinery equipment. Recently, they have been busy building employee cafeterias and winter changing rooms and are preparing to expand dormitories and kitchens. The capitalist invests heavily in the construction of each building, striving for solidity and durability, equipped with fire hydrants and fire extinguishers. This is the result of the rapid development of Xingdong Oil Mill after liberation. In 1946, the factory's capital was only one million yuan (Northeast currency, same below), equivalent to forty thousand catties of oil; now it has expanded to one hundred and fifty-seven billion yuan, equivalent to seven hundred and forty-seven thousand six hundred catties of oil. It earns substantial profits every year, accounting for about one-third of the total profits of the city's top nine private oil mills.
    Since the abolition of the unreasonable profit-sharing system in 1947, the Xingdong Oil Mill's trade union has led workers to unite with the capitalist to jointly develop production, normalizing labor-capital relations. With the support of the state-owned economy, Xingdong Oil Mill processes soybeans for the state every year, at least six hundred train cars. In order to reduce costs, the capitalist first added a soybean warehouse, allowing thirty to fifty cars of soybeans to enter the warehouse directly, reducing transportation costs by eight hundred yuan per hundred catties of beans, saving thousands of sacks each year; secondly, reducing redundant personnel, saving expenses, according to productivity calculations, Xingdong saves twenty-two employees compared to Yuanjuxiang in the city; thirdly, in the procurement of raw materials, they are purchased in batches with planning. Starting from these small details, accumulating little by little, processing six hundred train cars of soybeans each year can reduce costs by fourteen billion yuan, and the actual profit increases relatively. In terms of improving output and quality, from November last year to May this year alone, it processed 35,283,935 catties of soybeans, yielding an extra two liang and two qian and four of oil and an extra four liang and one qian and nine of cake per hundred catties. The reason for the increased production is that, on the one hand, there are heated warehouses, good soybean sieves, and oil straw quality, which can produce more oil; more importantly, the workers are studying technology. For example, last year, it was discovered that the quality was not as good as that of Tongchenghe Oil Mill. After the Party branch and the trade union organized employees to visit, each hundred catties of beans produced an extra liang of oil, and the oil extraction rate also increased by sixteen percent compared to 1948. During the sudden task of processing soybeans this spring, the daily oil output decreased by more than seven hundred catties. The branch secretary, Xiu Longqi, and the workers took the lead in researching and improving the methods, discovering shortcomings such as the thick soybean bed and the uneven soybean cakes, and immediately found ways to correct them, restoring production to normal. In this way, the capitalist has profits to earn, running around to find work, actively finding ways out for production. This May (off-season), other oil mills stopped working one after another according to usual practice, but Xingdong worked for another month because it had taken on a batch of work.
    Currently, it is further promoting the improvement of production management and establishing an administrative management production organization through labor-capital consultation meetings. In the past, the factory's capitalist controlled workers through nine large and small foremen. Four large foremen did not participate in production, gambling, embezzling, and extorting workers. Whoever did not obey was punished. In 1946, the trade union led workers to overthrow the foreman system. The workers' awareness has improved, and they can all take good care of production, thus putting forward many suggestions for improvement. However, it is not easy for the capitalist to change the old management style and system, promote democracy, and improve production. For example, in the past, when the millstone was broken and the cake quality was not good, affecting the low oil yield, the workers' suggestion to the capitalist to repair it was not resolved in time. The workers proposed that after repairing the twenty-six small stacks of cake rings, more than two thousand three hundred and eighty catties of oil could be produced each month, but the capitalist did not consider it. In addition, the trade union's enthusiasm and responsibility for leading production are good, but some work exceeds the scope of management. Both sides have opinions on these issues, but there has been no opportunity to propose solutions. At the first consultation meeting in mid-May, more than twenty production suggestions from workers were adopted. At the second consultation meeting in late June, the scope and organization of production management were discussed, and it was agreed that the factory would set up two departments, production and general affairs, and each production department would establish an administrative production group, directly commanded and led by the factory's production department. Regarding the establishment of administrative production groups, both labor and capital had concerns. Labor was afraid of restoring the old management system, and capital was afraid of not leading well. After discussion and deliberation, the concerns were resolved, and it was decided that the administrative group leader would also serve as the trade union group leader, elected by the workers, to better represent the workers' opinions and unite the capital to improve production.
    Xingdong Oil Mill has achieved great development in its business over the past three years by correcting labor-capital relations. Especially after adjusting public-private relations since May, the capitalist is willing to further strive for the transformation of enterprise operation and management. The factory manager once said: "The future of the oil mill business is bright. With the government and workers leading and caring about production so much, private industrialists must also change their style and move forward with the times!"

　　飞速发展的哈市私营兴东油坊
    李俊
    三年来营业扩展十数倍的哈尔滨市私营兴东油坊，一九四九年修建了两千平方米大仓库，能容大豆二百火车。资方这样扩大工厂的事业心是谁培植的呢？一位二十九年的油坊老机工告诉我们：“如今资本家经营心这样旺盛，还不是人民政府领导和工人推动的。”他举出一件事实：去年六月二十四日，工厂仓库起了火。最初经理含泪目睹着苦心经营的事业将化成灰烬，但百余工人立即冲进火堆，爬上屋顶，奋不顾身地抢救了工厂的财产，却没有一个人去照看自己的行李。当时工厂现款仅够开支，工人向资方提议晚发工资先修仓库；政府又拨给大豆加工，并且先付了加工费，以便资金周转。
    兴东油坊在伪满时设备相当简陋，工厂四周以木栅为界，木板仓库没有防火和暖豆设备，仅能容七火车豆子，剩下的都堆在院心日晒雨淋。院内泥泞，宿舍阴湿，窗户是纸糊的。资方干一年混一年，计划性简直谈不到，修烟筒用一分半铁板，不肯用二分铁板，其实价钱相差有限，二分却比一分半耐久十年。如今兴东油坊院外红砖墙，院内石头马路，崭新的红砖建筑物接连一片，面积达七千平方米。新修的大油囤高十三米，直径十米，装油二百万斤。红砖仓库附近有俱乐部和工人宿舍，又改修了大锅炉和机器设备。最近又忙着修建职工食堂和冬季换衣室，并准备扩大宿舍和厨房。每座建筑物的修建，资方均不惜大量投资，力求坚固耐久，设有防火拴，购置救火器。这是由于解放后兴东油坊营业飞速发展的结果。该厂一九四六年资金仅百万元（东北币，下同），相当四万斤油；如今扩大到一百五十七亿元，相当七十四万七千六百斤油。每年获利甚厚，占全市私营九大油坊利润三分之一左右。
    兴东油坊自一九四七年取消不合理的分红制度以后，工会就领导工人团结资方共同发展生产，使劳资关系走向正常。在国营经济的扶助之下，兴东油坊每年为国家加工大豆，最少为六百火车。资方为减低成本，首先增设了大豆仓，来了三、五十车大豆可直接入仓，每百斤豆就可减少搬运费八百元，每年可省麻袋千条；其次是减少冗员，节省开支，按生产力计算，兴东比该市元聚祥省职工二十二人；第三，在原材料的采购上，都是有计划地成批购买。从这些小处着手，积少成多，每年加工六百火车大豆可减低成本十四亿元，实际利润则相对增加。在提高产量质量方面，仅从去年十一月到今年五月间，加工大豆三千五百二十八万三千九百三十五斤，每百斤多得油二两二钱四，多得饼四两一钱九。增产的原因，一方面是设有暖仓，筛豆机和油草质量好，可以多出油；更重要的是工人钻研技术。如去年发现质量不如同成和油坊，党支部和工会组织职工参观后，每百斤豆子就多出一两油，榨油率比一九四八年也增加了百分之十六。今年春天突击加工大豆任务时，每天出油产量降低七百多斤，支部书记修龙起工友带头研究改进办法，发现豆炕铺的厚，豆?子太整等缺点，马上设法改正，使生产恢复正常。这样资方有利可赚，到处奔走揽活，积极为生产找出路，今年五月（淡月）别的油坊按惯例先后停工，兴东却因揽了一批活又干了一个月。
    目前更通过劳资协商会推动改进生产管理，建立行政管理生产的机构。该厂资方过去曾通过九名大小把头管制工人，四名大把头不参加生产，设赌吃私勒索工人，谁不服从就算谁。一九四六年工会领导工人推翻了把头制，工人觉悟提高了，都能对生产很好的关心了，因而提出了许多改进意见。但要资方转变旧的管理作风与制度，发扬民主搞好生产却很不容易。如：过去碾子坏了，?质量不好，影响出油率低，工人建议资方修理未得及时解决。二十六个小垛子的饼圈不好住，工人提出修好以后，每月可多出油两千三百八十多斤，但资方没考虑。另外工会领导生产的热情和负责精神是好的，但有些工作是超过了管理范围。这些问题双方都有意见，但都没有时机提出解决。五月中旬在第一次协商会上，工人二十多条生产建议被采纳了，六月下旬在第二次协商会上讨论了生产管理范围与组织，协议厂方设生产、总务两部，各生产部门建立行政生产小组，由厂方生产部直接指挥领导。关于建立行政生产小组，劳资双方曾存在顾虑，劳方怕恢复旧的管理制度，资方怕领导不好。经过讨论酝酿解决了顾虑，决定了行政小组长兼工会小组长，由工人推选，以求更好代表工人意见团结资方搞好生产。
    兴东油坊经过三年来端正劳资关系，营业获得巨大发展，特别是经过五月以来的调整公私关系后，资方已愿进一步努力于企业经营管理的改造。该厂经理曾这样表示：“油坊事业前途远大，政府和工人如此领导和关心生产，私营工业者也必须转变作风，随着时代前进！”
