　　Labor Hero Zhao Guoyou of the Shenyang Third Machine Factory telegraphed this newspaper from Shenyang on the 19th, stating:
　　U.S. President Truman's bandit declaration openly announced armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and strengthened interference in the internal affairs of Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries. This is entirely a manifestation of imperialism's death throes and self-destruction. We have the strength and full confidence to liberate Taiwan. The Korean people's war of liberation will also surely be victorious. These past few days, hearing the news of the continuous victories of the Korean People's Army's counteroffensive, and the successive defeats of the American bandits, the American army will certainly not escape the iron palms of the people's power. Most of the world's people are already on our side of the peace and democracy camp. No matter how many weapons the United States has, or how the American monopoly capitalists make their wishful thinking, the power of the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is incomparably powerful. The United States' launching of a war of aggression is completely courting death. I am determined to work hard, improve quality, and, along with all the workers in the factory, propose a model workshop with no defective products for the entire month, to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating our territory of Taiwan, and I am determined to support the people's revolutions in Korea and other countries, and resolutely oppose the American massacre of peaceful people.
　　We still remember that when Shenyang was liberated, American planes bombed and killed several of our factory workers, the factory buildings were also bombed and collapsed, and only two members of Guo Baoshu's entire family were left. We will forever remember this hatred. Today, the Chinese People's Great Revolution has basically triumphed. It is truly daydreaming for the United States to try to support Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and turn China into its colony again.

　　【Furthermore reported】Li Yong, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive and a special-class labor hero, also made the following statement in Tianjin:
　　I recently drove a train to Tianjin. On the train, the conductor asked passengers to sign the peace declaration. I saw all the passengers on the train vying to sign. The Chinese people love peace, and the people of the whole world love peace! If the American bandits dare to invade our Taiwan, they are asking for trouble.
　　We have Chairman Mao, how can we be afraid of American imperialism!
　　The peace-loving people of the whole world are on our side. If everyone works together, we can defeat the American bandits!

　　劳动英雄赵国有李永
    抗议美国侵略台湾朝鲜
    【本报讯】沈阳第三机器厂劳动英雄赵国有十九日由沈阳致电本报称：
    美国总统杜鲁门的强盗声明，竟公开宣布武装侵略台湾和朝鲜，加强对越南、菲律宾等国内政的干涉，这完全是帝国主义垂死挣扎自取灭亡的表现。我们有力量也有充分信心解放台湾。朝鲜人民的解放战争也一定会胜利。这几天，听到朝鲜人民军反攻连续胜利的消息，美国强盗节节败退，美军一定逃不出人民力量的铁掌。世界人民已大半在咱和平民主阵营这边。任凭美国有多少武器，美国独占资本家如何打如意算盘，但是以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营力量，是强大无比的。美国发动侵略战争，完全是自找死路。我坚决努力工作，提高质量，和全厂工友在高度热情之中，提出搞好全月没有一件废品的模范车间，来支援人民解放军解放我国领土台湾，并决心声援朝鲜等国的人民革命，坚决反对美国对和平人民的屠杀。
    我们还记得，沈阳解放的时候，美国飞机炸死我们厂好几个工友，厂房也炸塌了，机器也炸坏了，郭宝树一大家子炸剩了两口。我们永远记着这个仇恨。今天，中国人民大革命已经基本胜利，美国再想扶持蒋匪把中国弄成他的殖民地，真是大白天作梦。
    【又讯】毛泽东号机车司机长特等劳动英雄李永在天津亦作如下的声明：
    我最近驾驶列车到天津。在车上，列车长请旅客在和平宣言书上签名。我看见全车旅客争先恐后地签名。中国人民爱和平，全世界人民爱和平！美国强盗胆敢侵略我们台湾，他是自找倒霉。
    我们有毛主席，难道我们还怕美国帝国主义！
    全世界爱好和平的人民，都站在我们这一边。大伙一齐努力，就能战胜美国强盗！
