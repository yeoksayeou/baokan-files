　　Raise Vigilance and Strengthen Warehouse Security Forces
    Municipal Bureau of Commerce Holds Security Conference

    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce convened a "Conference on Strengthening Security Work in Economic Departments" on the 11th, gathering the heads of storage and transportation departments and security personnel from fifteen specialized companies in the city. Representatives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions attended the meeting. After each specialized company reported on the situation of their warehouses and security work, Peng Cheng, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Commerce, instructed each company to immediately redouble their attention to security work. By the 15th, they should formulate improvement plans and submit them to a research group organized by the Bureau of Commerce, the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for research and review, so as to create a comprehensive and practical plan and method for improving security work. At the same time, he pointed out that they must not be satisfied with past achievements, but must be highly vigilant, maintain confidentiality to prevent special agents, strengthen warehouse security forces, and improve fire prevention, mildew prevention, and safety equipment. They must also establish a sound warehouse system and rely on workers to do a good job in security work. Zhu, Section Chief of the Public Security Bureau, introduced the activities of special agents and called on everyone to eliminate complacency.

    In the past, state-owned companies in Beijing had paid sufficient attention to security work, especially warehouse security work. In May of last year, the former Beijing Municipal Trading Company called on the department store, grain, and cotton yarn companies to pay attention to "five preventions" – preventing special agents, theft, air raids, fire, and mildew. Each branch immediately established security committees and organizations for air defense and fire prevention. In March of this year, when the US-Chiang bandit planes bombed Shanghai, coinciding with the approaching rainy season, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, together with the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Fire Brigade, jointly inspected the larger warehouses of various specialized companies, pointed out methods for improvement, and convened a meeting of the heads of storage and transportation departments and warehouse directors to promote increased warehouse security work. After the explosion at the Fuhua Mining and Pharmaceutical Factory on June 14, the Bureau again instructed all companies to raise their vigilance. Each company has also earnestly implemented these instructions and made considerable achievements. Taking the grain company's warehouse as an example, a large amount of grain is stored there, including northeastern wet corn with a moisture content of up to 23-24%, and very little of it has spoiled so far.

　　提高警惕加强仓库警卫力量
    市商业局召开保卫会议
    【本报讯】京市商业局于十一日召集本市十五个专业公司储运科长及保卫人员举行“加强经济部门保卫工作会议”，市公安局、市总工会均派员列席。会上，各专业公司汇报仓库及保卫工作情况后，商业局副局长彭城指示各公司应立即加倍重视保卫工作，于十五日制订改进计划，交由商业局、公安局、市总工会组织的研究组研究审查，以便为改进保卫工作订出一套较周密而切合实际的计划与办法。同时并指出切勿满足于过去的成绩，要高度警惕，防特保密，加强仓库警卫力量及防火、防霉安全设备，建立健全的仓库制度，结合并倚靠工人做好保卫工作。公安局朱科长介绍了特务活动情况，号召大家肃清麻痹思想。
    京市各国营公司过去对保卫工作，特别是仓库保卫工作曾有过足够的注意。去年五月，前北京市贸易公司曾号召百货、粮食、花纱布三分公司注意五防——防特、防盗、防空、防火、防霉。各分公司当即分别成立了保卫委员会及防空、防火等组织。今年三月，美蒋匪机轰炸上海，是时又值雨季将临，市商业局曾与市公安局、消防队共同检查各专业公司的较大仓库，指出改进办法，并召开各储运科长、仓库主任会议，促使增强仓储保卫工作。六月十四日辅华矿药厂爆炸后，该局复指示各公司提高警惕。各公司亦均认真执行，并做出相当成绩。以粮食公司仓库为例，仓储粮食甚多，其中东北湿玉米含水量最高达百分之二十三至二十四，至今极少霉坏。
