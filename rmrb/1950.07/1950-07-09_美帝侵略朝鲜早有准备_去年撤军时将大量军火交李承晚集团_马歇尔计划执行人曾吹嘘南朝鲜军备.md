　　U.S. Imperialism Prepared to Invade Korea Long Ago
    When Withdrawing Troops Last Year, They Gave a Large Amount of Military Supplies to the Syngman Rhee Clique
    Marshall Plan Executive Bragged About South Korean Armaments
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch] TASS, New York, July 7th: A report drafted by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee indicates that the United States had conducted large-scale preparations before invading Korea. The report reveals that when the U.S. occupation forces ostensibly withdrew from South Korea last July, the United States handed over military supplies worth $110 million to the Syngman Rhee clique. A United Press Washington reporter said the report revealed that the equipment transferred to the Syngman Rhee clique included more than 100,000 rifles and other small arms, more than 2,000 anti-tank "bazookas" and 40,000 rockets, more than 4,900 trucks and other vehicles, a large number of 37mm and 57mm caliber direct-fire guns, 105mm howitzers, 60mm and 80mm mortars and 700,000 shells, and 40,000 Japanese-style rifles and ammunition. In addition, the United States provided 79 ships, including minesweepers, landing craft and patrol boats.
    The military supplies provided by the United States to the Syngman Rhee clique last July were enough to equip a force of 50,000 men, but the United Press reporter added regretfully, "A large amount of these materials were probably abandoned during the hasty retreat of South Korea."
    Further proof that the United States was preparing to invade Korea is contained in the testimony given by Marshall Plan officials at a secret meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee last month. According to publicly released records of the committee's discussions, Marshall Plan Deputy Administrator Foster openly boasted about South Korea's military preparations on June 13th. Foster declared that, due to a "rigorous training program, an army of 100,000 well-trained men has been established, ready to meet any challenge from North Korean forces."
    Marshall Plan Korea Executive Johnson also made similar remarks. Johnson's testimony revealed that the American imperialists were eager to make Korea the source of tungsten that the United States needed.

　　美帝侵略朝鲜早有准备
    去年撤军时将大量军火交李承晚集团
    马歇尔计划执行人曾吹嘘南朝鲜军备
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：美国众院外交委员会所拟就的报告指明：美国在侵略朝鲜以前就已进行了大规模的准备。该报告透露：在去年七月美国占领军表面上从南朝鲜撤退的时候，美国曾经把价值一亿一千万美元的军火交给李承晚集团。合众社华盛顿记者说，报告透露，这样移交给李承晚集团的装备，包括十万余枝步枪及其他小型武器，两千多门反坦克的“火箭筒”及四万发火箭弹，四千九百余辆卡车及其他车辆，大量三十七公厘及五十七公厘口径的平射炮，一○五公厘的榴弹炮，六十公厘及八十公厘的迫击炮及七十万发炮弹，四万枝日式步枪及弹药。此外，美国并给与七十九艘船只，包括扫雷艇、登陆艇及巡逻艇等。
    美国在去年七月供给李承晚集团的军火，足够装备五万人的部队，但合众社记者遗憾地加上一句说：“其中大量物资在南朝鲜慌忙退却时大概都被抛弃了。”
    美国准备侵略朝鲜的进一步证明，包含在马歇尔计划官员们上月在参院拨款委员会的秘密会议上所作的证言中。据公开发表的委员会的讨论记录说，马歇尔计划副执行人福斯特在六月十三日曾公开吹嘘南朝鲜的军事准备。福斯特宣称，由于“严格的训练计划，十万训练良好的陆军已经建立起来，准备应付北朝鲜部队的任何挑战”。
    马歇尔计划朝鲜执行人琼逊也发表类似的谈话。琼逊的证言透露了美国帝国主义者热衷地要把朝鲜当作美国所需要的钨矿的来源地。
