　　Unite More Closely with International Friends to Manage the China Changchun Railway and Defend Peace in the Far East

    Youth League workers, model cadres, youth advanced inspection teams, youth core "Iron Ox" drivers, model League groups, model League members, and model correspondents of the China Changchun Railway Second Sub-bureau have all protested against the U.S. imperialists' open armed intervention in Korea's internal affairs and their aggressive actions to prevent our Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. They voiced their opinions and expressed their determination to oppose American aggression.

    The comrades of the League Sub-committee of the China Changchun Railway Second Sub-bureau said: The Chinese people are about to liberate all of the country's land, and the United States, despite using considerable force, cannot stop the Chinese people's just actions. This time, the United States openly helped the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, "personally sending troops," and MacArthur personally commanded them. As a result, not only did the Syngman Rhee bandit army's offensive fail, but many American soldiers were also annihilated. This further proves that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger. The earlier U.S. imperialism provokes war, the sooner it will be finished; the later it provokes war, the later it will be finished! Chi Minghai, secretary of the League Sub-committee, said: We must carry out extensive propaganda and educate all League members and young workers to unite more closely with our international friends, implement the resolutions of the first League Congress of the Eastern Railway, and manage the China Changchun Railway into a model railway for the whole country, to answer the ambitious aggressors and war provokers of American imperialism, who dream of dominating the world! Defend the eternal peace of the Far East and the world.

    Bai Xiaosheng, leader of the Youth Advanced Group of the Harbin Rolling Stock Inspection Section, said: We will not allow the U.S. imperialists to invade again! We must learn diligently from our Soviet elder brothers in our actual work, improve our technology, and improve our work to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    Qiao Yuyan, driver of the 1008 Youth Core "Iron Ox" chartered car group of the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot, said: I guarantee that there will be no accidents, large or small, in my work. I will save coal and oil, continue to carry out the 500-kilometer movement, and create more practical models to support our victory against aggression.

    Feng Youping, deputy secretary of the League General Branch of the Harbin Locomotive Depot, and Wang Peixin, propaganda committee member of the Transportation Branch, said: Truman's statement this time, regarding armed intervention in the people's liberation movement, will not only fail to stop our progress but will also further strengthen our determination to liberate all of our motherland's territory. We guarantee to carry out propaganda to every locomotive group, prevent accidents in our work, carry out the 500-kilometer movement, and continue the "ten trips without accidents" movement.

    Du Xifang, model correspondent of the Fourth Telegraph Section, said: Tell the U.S. imperialists, your clamoring and intimidation will not scare us! Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and with the help of our international friend, the Soviet elder brother, the Chinese people have armed our minds and are not afraid of you!

    We once again warn the U.S. imperialists: Prepare to be the son of Hitler and the grandson of Mussolini in the end! We are now ready. We have enough power to defeat you. We have the proletarian brothers of the whole world with us! (Written by Sui Ren)

　　和国际友人更紧密地团结办好中长路保卫远东和平
    中长铁路第二分局员工
    中长铁路第二分局的青年团工作人员、模范干部、青年前进甲检组、青年基干铁牛司机、模范团组模范团员、模范通讯员等都纷纷对美帝国主义公开武装干涉朝鲜内政、阻止我中国人民解放台湾的侵略行动提出抗议，说出自己要说的话，表示了自己反对美国侵略的决心。
    中长路二分局团分委会的同志们说：中国人民把全国的土地都要解放啦，美国用了不算小的力量，却阻挡不了中国人民的正义行动。这次美国公开地帮助李承晚匪帮，“亲自出兵”，麦克阿瑟亲自指挥，结果不但李承晚匪军进攻失败，美国兵也叫歼灭了不少。这又更进一步的证明了美帝是只纸老虎，美帝国主义早挑拨起战争早完蛋，晚挑拨起战争晚完蛋！团分委书记迟明海说：我们要进行广泛的宣传，教育全体团员和青年工人们，更紧密地跟国际友人团结在一起，贯彻东铁首届团代大会的决议，把中长铁路办成为全国的示范铁路，来回答梦想独占统治全世界的野心家侵略者、战争的挑拨者美国帝国主义！保卫远东的世界的永远和平。
    哈尔滨检车段青年前进组组长白晓生说：不许美帝再来侵略！我们要在实际工作中跟苏联老大哥好好地学习，把技术提高，把工作改进，支援人民解放军解放台湾。
    昂昂溪机务段一○○八青年基干铁牛包车组司机乔玉岩说：我保证在工作中不出任何大小事故，省煤、省油、继续开展五○○公里运动，多创造出些实际典型，来支持我们反侵略的胜利。
    哈尔滨机务段团总支副书记冯有平和运输支部宣委王培新说：这次杜鲁门的声明武装干涉人民解放运动，不但阻止不了我们的前进，反而更增强了我们的必须要解放全部祖国土地的信心，我们保证向每台机车组进行宣传，在工作中不出事故，开展五百公里运动，继续十趟车无事故运动。
    电务第四段模范通讯员杜锡芳说：告诉美帝国主义，你叫嚣恫吓吓不倒我们！中国人民在毛泽东同志的领导下在国际友人苏联老大哥的帮助下武装了头脑，不怕你！
    我们向美帝国主义者再次提出警告：你准备最后去当希特勒的儿子莫索里尼的孙子去吧！我们现在已经准备好了，我们有足够的力量打败你，我们有全世界的无产阶级弟兄在一起！（隋仁执笔）
