City Public Health Bureau Formulates Measures
Free Medical Care for Impoverished Citizens

[Beijing City News Agency Dispatch] To enable sick citizens who are unable to pay for medical treatment to receive medical care, the Beijing City Public Health Bureau has formulated free medical care implementation measures, which have been notified to relevant units for implementation. These measures are divided into two types: free outpatient services and free hospitalization. The procedures for requesting free medical care are as follows: for hospitalization, a certificate of genuine poverty must be obtained from the local district government where the applicant resides; for outpatient services, a certificate must be obtained from the local police station where the applicant resides (in suburban areas, a certificate from the district government or township government is also acceptable). The applicant must also bring their household registration booklet to apply to the designated medical unit. Workers requesting free outpatient services may be introduced by the district trade union office in each district (the application procedure for free hospitalization is the same as for ordinary citizens). Patients with emergency conditions can be treated first, and the procedures can be completed later. Free outpatient services are provided by a total of forty-four units, including municipal hospitals, health centers, the Public Health Bureau's mobile medical team, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Daoji Hospital, Central People's Hospital, Peking University Hospital, Children's Hospital, French Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Hui People's Hospital, Shifangyuan Health Center, Workers' Hospital, and workers' clinics and medical cooperatives in each district. The daily quota for free outpatient services in the city is nine hundred and seventy-six, which is appropriately allocated according to the conditions in each district. In order to balance the workload of medical units, general requests for free outpatient services must be treated at the medical units designated by district to avoid overcrowding. Free hospitalization is provided by nine units, including the Municipal First, Second, Third, and Fourth Hospitals, the Infectious Disease Hospital, the Mental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital, Daoji Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and Peking University Hospital, with a total of one hundred and seventy-four free beds, without district restrictions. The Infectious Disease Hospital only admits patients with acute infectious diseases, the Mental Disease Hospital only admits mental patients, and the remaining hospitals admit emergency, accidental injury, and acute patients. Citizens with questions can inquire at their district public office (government).
