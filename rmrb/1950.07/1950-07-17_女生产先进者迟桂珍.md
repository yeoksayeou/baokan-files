　　Female Production Advanced Worker, Chi Guizhen

　　Chi Guizhen is a female worker at the Northeast Garment Bureau's rubber shoe factory and also a member of the factory's management committee. She has been in the factory for exactly three years. In these three years, she has made 100,000 pairs of rubber shoe soles, exceeding the original production target by 15,000 pairs, and the quality is very good, with not a single second-class product. Therefore, she has received four medals, was named a special-class model member of the Communist Youth League in Harbin, and was admitted to the Party in March of this year, becoming a glorious member of the Communist Party of China.

　　Chi Guizhen is eighteen years old this year and comes from Chi Village in Huang County, Shandong. When she was nine years old, because her family was very poor and the Japanese devils were constantly wreaking havoc on the people in the village, she had no choice but to follow her mother to Harbin, Northeast China, to find her father. But her father was a tile worker and had an unstable income. So, at the age of ten, she followed her mother in spinning thread. At eleven, she went outside to pick up coal cinders. At twelve, she was introduced to work in a candy factory. There's no need to talk about the suffering she endured. It wasn't until the "August 15th" liberation of Northeast China that she was liberated.

　　In June 1947, Chi Guizhen was introduced by the Poor People's Association to work at the rubber shoe factory. At that time, the factory had just been established, and the machines had not yet been installed. She carried machine parts, leveled the courtyard, and whitewashed walls like the male workers. After work started, she watched others glue the soles for two days and then started doing it herself. If she didn't know how to do something, she would ask Sister Ma who was near her. Because she worked diligently, the quality of her products was very good, and she never produced a single second-class product. The factory's standard production quota was sixty pairs a day, but she could make seventy to eighty pairs a day. At the end-of-year commendation, she was named a second-class meritorious worker and received her first medal. When the Communist Youth League was first established in the factory, she was the first to be admitted. Because she worked well, she was also elected as the group leader.

　　In October 1948, during the October Revolution celebrations, the factory launched a production competition. She led her group to respond to this call and took the lead in setting tasks. While other groups set a target of 3,000 pairs, her group set a target of 3,500 pairs and guaranteed to eliminate third-class products. Zhang Shulan, from her group, used to make nothing but third-class products. Chi Guizhen understood the problems in her work and provided her with specific assistance. As a result, Zhang Shulan never made a single third-class product again. At the production summary, her group not only completed the original target but also exceeded it by 450 pairs, and not a single pair was a second-class product. At the commendation meeting of the First Bureau of the Military Supplies Department, she was named a first-class meritorious worker and received her second medal.

　　Last year, during the Red May production competition, she again called on all the workers in the group to respond to this movement, first by setting plans, writing guarantees, and challenging Group Seven. Some workers in her group lacked understanding of the competition. She immediately reported the situation to the Youth League branch and superiors. The League instructed her to educate them through practical actions. Back in the group, she often helped Xiao Liu, who was lagging behind in her work, to do odd jobs (fetching gasoline, fetching paste, delivering work). With her help, Xiao Liu gradually improved and also joined the Communist Youth League. At the summary, her group not only completed the original plan but also exceeded it by 400 pairs and collected thirty pounds of scrap rubber during the production competition. As a result, her group was named a model group for the entire factory. She was awarded one major merit and one minor merit. At the 1949 production summary meeting of the First Bureau of the Military Supplies Department, she was again named a first-class labor hero and received another labor hero medal.

　　When the factory established a night school in June, she immediately signed up to participate. She not only studied well herself but also often helped others. Because of the brilliant achievements she had made in production and study, she was named a special-class model member of the Communist Youth League in Harbin in January of this year.

　　At the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions' Red May commendation meeting for advanced production workers, she gloriously received her fourth medal - the advanced production worker medal.

　　At the celebration of the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China this year, she said to all the Party members in the factory: "Although I have received today's achievements through the Party's cultivation and education, I still have shortcomings. I must work harder to strengthen my own training and strive to become a better Communist Party member by the next Party anniversary."

　　女生产先进者迟桂珍
    迟桂珍是东北被服局胶鞋厂的女工，也是该厂管理委员会的委员。她从入工厂到现在，正好三年。在这三年中，她共上了胶鞋大底十万双，超过了原定产量一万五千双，并且质量很好，没有一双二等品。因此，三年来她陆续得过四枚奖章，被评为哈尔滨市特等模范团员，并于今年三月间被吸收入党，成为光荣的中国共产党党员。
    迟桂珍今年十八岁，老家在山东黄县迟家村。她九岁那年，因为家里很穷，日本鬼子又三日两头地到村子里糟塌老百姓，没有办法在老家继续生活，便跟着妈妈到东北哈尔滨找爸爸。但爸爸是个干瓦匠活的，也是吃了这顿没那顿。所以她十岁就跟着妈妈纺线，十一岁到外面去捡煤滓，十二岁，托人介绍到一家糖果工厂干活。受罪的事那就不用说了。一直到“八一五”东北解放，她才得到解放。
    一九四七年六月，迟桂珍由贫民会介绍到胶鞋厂干活。当时工厂刚建立，机器都没有装设。她和男工友一样抬机器零件、垫院心、刷墙。开工后，人家粘大底，她看了两天，自己就开始干了；有不会的，就问在她跟前的马姐。因为她工作认真，她的产品质量都很好，没出过一双二等品。工厂规定的生产数量标准是一天六十双，但她每天能做七十双到八十双。在年底评功时，她被评为二等功臣，得到第一枚奖章。青年团在工厂刚建团，她头一个被吸收入团了。因为她干活好，又被大家选上当小组长。
    一九四八年十月革命节，工厂开展生产竞赛，她领导小组响应这个号召，首先订任务。别的小组订三千双，她们小组订三千五百双，并保证消灭三等品。他那组的张淑兰，过去尽做三等品。迟桂珍了解了她工作中的毛病，就对她进行具体的帮助。因此，张淑兰就再没做出一双三等品来了。在生产总结的时候，她那一小组不但完成了原订任务，还超过了四百五十双，而且没有一双是二等品。在军需部第一局庆功大会上，她被评为一等功臣，又得到第二枚奖章。
    去年红五月生产竞赛运动时，她又号召全组工友响应这一运动，首先订计划，写保证，向七组挑战。她们小组有的工友对竞赛缺乏认识，她马上将情况反映到团支部和上级。团指示她要用实际行动教育她们。她回到组里，便经常帮助工作较落后的小刘做零活（领汽油、领浆子、交活）。小刘在她帮助下，渐渐进步，也加入了青年团。在总结的时候，她们小组除完成原订的计划外，还超过四百双，并在生产竞赛中捡了三十斤碎胶皮。结果，她们小组被评为全厂模范小组。她被评了一大功一小功。在军需部第一局一九四九年的生产总结大会上，她又被评为一等劳动英雄，又得到一枚劳动英雄奖章。
    工厂在六月间成立了夜校，她立即报名参加。她不仅自己学习得好，还经常帮助别人。因为她在生产中及学习中所获得的辉煌的成绩，今年一月，她又被评为哈市特等模范团员。
    在哈市总工会红五月奖励生产先进者大会上，她又光荣地得到第四枚奖章——生产先进者奖章。
    在今年“七一”中国共产党诞生二十九周年纪念大会上，她向全厂党员说：“我虽然经党的培养和教育，得到今天的成绩，但我还有缺点。我要更努力加强自己的锻炼，争取在明年党的生日时，成为一个更好的共产党员。”
