Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 7th. The people of Zhejiang Province warmly support the Land Reform Law, and the farmers are particularly excited. Long Yue, director of the Provincial Farmers Association Committee, said: We have the conditions to carry out land reform in most parts of the province after this autumn. He said: For more than a year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's governments at all levels, Zhejiang farmers have actively participated in the suppression of bandits, anti-despot, and rent reduction movements. Through these movements, Zhejiang farmers have been initially organized and have demonstrated their strength. In most parts of the province, bandits have been basically eliminated, and the power of despots has been dealt a certain blow. The consciousness of the farmers has been greatly improved. More than four million male and female farmers throughout the province have participated in organizations such as farmers' associations, women's federations, and militia self-defense forces. In various movements, a large number of farmer activists and farmer cadres have emerged and been cultivated. All of these have laid the foundation for implementing land reform after this autumn. Farmers in various parts of the province were very excited after seeing the Land Reform Law. Farmers in Ningbo rushed to the city to buy newspapers on the day the Land Reform Law was announced and returned to their villages to hold meetings to discuss it. Farmers in Majiaqiao Village, Yiqiao Township, Hang County, unanimously and enthusiastically supported the Land Reform Law promulgated by Chairman Mao at a discussion meeting. They said: This is a great happy event for the people. Hired peasant Wu Yougen expressed his determination to stand up at the meeting; poor peasant Mo Changqing told of the suffering he had endured from feudal exploitation in the past, and said that after being allocated land, he would definitely produce well and live a good life. Middle peasants and rich peasants also believed that the Land Reform Law was a good way to develop production, and said that they would definitely produce well. On the same evening, more than 150 farmers in Dongshao Village, Cixi County, asked the working cadres about the content of the Land Reform Law. They praised Chairman Mao as the great benefactor of the farmers. Farmers in the Second Village, Shanqiao Township, Hang County, originally planned to increase production by 20% this year. After seeing the Land Reform Law, they revised their plan and prepared to increase production even more.

The Land Reform Law has also won unanimous support from other classes in Zhejiang. Industrial and commercial figures in Hangzhou cited examples to prove that with the development of agricultural production and the increase in farmers' purchasing power, industry and commerce will have broader prospects for development. Huang Chucun, manager of the Yusheng Cloth Factory in the city, said: Between May and June this year, when more tea and silk were on the market, cotton cloth sales doubled. People in cultural and educational circles believe that after land reform, with the elimination of feudalism, the influence of feudal ideology on intellectuals for thousands of years will be more easily eliminated. Meng Xiancheng, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Zhejiang University, believes that land reform is a good opportunity for old intellectuals to be tempered, and he hopes that the people's government will allow some professors to go to the countryside to participate in the work during the land reform period. Students also sincerely expressed their support for land reform. The Provincial Student Federation and the Hangzhou Municipal Student Federation unanimously stated that they would resolutely inherit the traditional spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement, always stand on the side of the people, and prepare to actively participate in land reform work to support land reform with concrete actions.

　　浙江具备土改条件
    各界拥护土地改革法  农民认为是天大喜事
    【新华社杭州七日电】浙江全省人民热烈拥护土地改革法，农民们尤其兴奋。省农民协会委员会主任龙跃说：我们已具备了今年秋后在全省大部地区内进行土地改革的条件。他说：一年多以来，浙江农民在中国共产党和各级人民政府的领导下，积极地参加了剿匪、反恶霸和减租等运动。从这些运动中，浙江农民已经初步组织起来并且表现了自己的力量。全省绝大部分地区股匪已基本消灭，恶霸势力已遭到一定程度的打击。农民的觉悟已大大提高，全省男女农民参加农民协会、妇女会和民兵自卫队等组织的已达四百余万。在各种运动中并且涌现了和培养了大批农民积极分子和农民干部。这些都为今年秋后实行土地改革打下了基础。全省各地农民在看到土地改革法后，都非常兴奋。宁波的农民，在土地改革法公布的当天，纷纷赶到市区购买报纸，回村自动召开会议讨论。杭县义桥乡马家桥村农民在座谈会上一致热烈拥护毛主席下令公布的土地改革法。他们说：这是人民天大的喜事。雇农吴友根在会上表示了要求翻身的决心；贫农莫长青诉说了过去受封建剥削的苦处，表示分到田后一定好好生产，过好日子。中农、富农也都认为土地改革法是发展生产的好办法，表示他们一定好好生产。慈溪县东邵村当天晚上有一百五十多个农民向工作干部询问土地改革法的内容。他们同声称赞毛主席是农民的大恩人。杭县山桥乡第二村农民原计划今年增产二成，看到土地改革法后，他们改订了计划，准备把生产更加提高。
    土地改革法在浙江其他各阶层中也获得一致的拥护。杭州市的工商业家以实例证明：农业生产发展了，农民购买力提高后，工商业将更有广阔的发展前途。该市裕生布厂经理黄楚村说：今年五六月间，茶叶和蚕丝上市较多，棉布销路就增加了两倍。文化教育界人士认为经过土地改革，随着封建的消灭，知识分子几千年来所受的封建思想影响，将更加容易肃清。浙江大学文学院孟宪承院长认为土地改革是旧知识分子获得锻炼的一个好机会，他希望人民政府允许部分教授在土地改革时期下乡参加工作。学生们也衷心地表示了对土地改革的拥护。省学联和杭州市学联均一致表示：坚决继承“五四”革命的传统精神，始终站在人民一边，准备积极参加土地改革工作，以具体行动来拥护和支持土地改革。
