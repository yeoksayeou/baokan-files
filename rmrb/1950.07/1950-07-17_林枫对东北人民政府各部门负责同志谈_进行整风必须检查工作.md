　　Lin Feng Talks to Responsible Comrades of Various Departments of the Northeast People's Government:
    Rectification Must Include Checking Work
    [This Newspaper News] According to Northeast Daily news: After Comrade Gao Gang of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee mobilized for rectification at the “July 1st” 29th Anniversary Cadre Meeting of the Party, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, separately convened symposiums with responsible cadres from various government departments in early July to give detailed instructions on the issue of rectification. Vice Chairman Lin Feng first pointed out: The rectification movement proposed by the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau is very necessary, and the direction is clear. After rectification, the economic construction of the Northeast will move forward. Regarding how to implement the rectification movement, Vice Chairman Lin Feng said: One should not adopt a rejecting or perfunctory attitude towards carrying out rectification, but must adopt a welcoming and serious attitude, rectify the problems, and move the work forward. Refusing rectification is equivalent to refusing a physical examination, equivalent to refusing to treat an illness. During rectification, it may be painful to rectify the existing problems. But if it is not painful, then it cannot be thoroughly rectified, and therefore no progress can be made. The key to deciding whether the rectification movement is carried out well or not lies in the leading cadres. Responsible comrades of each department must take personal responsibility, set an example, first make profound and serious criticisms and self-criticisms, fully promote democracy, closely connect with the masses, improve work, and educate cadres.
    Vice Chairman Lin Feng then pointed out: To implement rectification, merely sitting in a room holding meetings and conducting self-examinations cannot solve the problem. It is necessary to conduct in-depth checks of work and personally go to various work positions and work sites to check work and implement policies. Because the purpose of this rectification is to strengthen the policy perspective, we cannot leave the current work tasks and policies and carry out abstract and isolated rectification. After checking the work, it is necessary to find specific ways to correct mistakes and problems, solve problems, educate cadres, and achieve concrete results.
    Vice Chairman Lin Feng, based on the work conditions of each department, made specific arrangements and detailed instructions for rectification. For example, regarding the rectification of the General Office of the Government, he said: The General Office should check its work according to three standards, which are: How well is the situation understood? How well are problems solved? How well are policies implemented? It is necessary to check how many laws and proclamations have been issued, what the role of these documents is, and what the actual implementation situation is. Emphasis should be placed on overcoming the existing phenomenon of "document travel". It is necessary to check the various problems existing in the promotion of government affairs. At the same time, we should conduct in-depth checks from the aspects of cadres' ideological style, work style, work methods, work systems, and organizational structure, find out the problems, determine specific methods, and strive to overcome them.
    Vice Chairman Lin Feng finally earnestly warned the responsible comrades of each department: "It can be affirmed that whichever department adopts a welcoming and serious attitude towards rectification, with the head taking responsibility and conducting in-depth checks, and carries out rectification well, that department's work will be greatly improved; conversely, whichever department does not carry out rectification seriously and in-depth, that department's work will undoubtedly fall behind."
    The rectification and study of various departments of the Northeast People's Government have now been initially launched. The General Branch of the Communist Party of the Ministry of Trade convened a general meeting of all party members (absorbing some members of the Youth League and non-party people) on July 4th to mobilize and deploy rectification. In this rectification, the department will focus on studying the various problems existing in the trade work serving industry and agriculture and meeting the needs of people's production and life.
    The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also convened a rectification mobilization meeting on July 10th. After Minister Du Zheheng analyzed the work situation of the department, he pointed out that the current focus of inspection is: First, water conservancy projects, dangerous works, dikes, and flood control work; second, the promotion of new farm tools; third, the management of funds and materials. Now the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have divided their work to lead in-depth inspections.

　　林枫对东北人民政府各部门负责同志谈
    进行整风必须检查工作
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：中共中央东北局高岗同志于“七一”党的二十九周年干部大会上动员整风以后，东北人民政府副主席林枫又于七月上旬分别召集政府各部门负责干部举行座谈，对整风问题做了详尽的指示。林枫副主席首先指出：党中央、东北局提出的整风运动是非常需要的，而方针又是明确的。经过整风将使东北的经济建设前进一步。关于如何贯彻整风运动，林枫副主席说：对于进行整风，不应采取拒绝和敷衍的态度，一定要采取欢迎与认真的态度，把毛病整好，使工作前进一步。拒绝整风就等于拒绝检查身体，等于拒绝治疗疾病。整风中对存在的毛病可能要整得痛些。但如果不痛不痒，那就不能整彻底，也就不能进步。整风运动进行得好或不好，决定的关键在领导干部。各部门负责同志必须亲自负责，以身作则，首先做深刻的严肃的批评和自我批评，充分发扬民主，紧密联系群众，改进工作，教育干部。
    林枫副主席接着指出：要贯彻整风仅仅坐在屋子里开会检讨是不能解决问题的，必须深入检查工作，必须亲自到各个工作岗位、工作现场去检查工作，贯彻政策。因为这次整风的目的是加强政策观点，所以不能离开当前工作任务与政策，抽象地孤立地整风。检查工作之后，要找出改正错误、改正毛病的具体办法，解决问题，教育干部，收到具体的效果。
    林枫副主席根据各部门工作情况，分别做了整风的具体布置与详尽指示。例如对政府办公厅的整风，他说：办公厅应该根据三条标准检查自己的工作，就是检查：对情况了解如何？解决问题如何？检查工作贯彻政策如何？要检查发了多少法令文告，这些文告的作用与实际执行情况如何，要着重检查克服目前存在的“公文旅行”现象。要检查政务推行中存在的各种毛病。同时应该从干部思想作风、工作作风、工作方法、工作制度、组织机构等方面来深入检查，找出毛病，定出具体办法，努力克服。
    林枫副主席最后恳切地告诫各部门负责同志：“可以肯定的说：那个部门对整风采取欢迎与认真的态度，首长负责，深入检查，整风整得好，那个部门的工作将大大改进一步；反之，那个部门不认真深入地进行整风，那个部门的工作无疑将会落后。”
    东北人民政府各部门的整风学习现已初步展开。贸易部中共总支于七月四日召开全体党员大会（吸收部分团员及非党群众参加），动员布置整风。该部在此次整风中将着重研究贸易工作为工业、农业服务，和供应人民生产生活需要中所存在的各种问题。
    农林部也在七月十日召开了整风动员大会。杜者蘅部长分析了该部工作情况后，指出目前检查重点是：一，水利工程、险工堤坝与防洪工作；二，新农具推广工作；三，资金物资管理工作。现在农林部负责同志已分工领导深入检查。
