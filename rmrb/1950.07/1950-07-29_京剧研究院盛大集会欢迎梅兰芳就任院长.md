Xinhua News Agency Report: The Peking Opera Research Institute recently held a grand gathering to welcome Mei Lanfang as the president of the Peking Opera Research Institute. The gathering was presided over by Tian Han, Director of the Bureau of Opera Reform. Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of Culture, Yang Shaoxuan and Ma Yanxiang, both Deputy Directors of the Bureau of Opera Reform, all members of the institute, and all students of the Experimental Opera School attended the gathering. Guests included Ouyang Yuqian, President of the Central Academy of Drama, and Hong Shen, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations. Tian Han delivered a speech first. He said: The Peking Opera Research Institute (formerly the Yan'an Peking Opera Troupe) has a history of nearly ten years. It has done a lot of useful work in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. The famous new historical dramas "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" and "The Three Attacks on the Zhu Family Village" are its representative works. With Mei Lanfang in charge, the institute will better combine progressive political ideology and highly artistic forms, and open up broad prospects for the cause of opera reform.

When Mei Lanfang spoke, he expressed his great pleasure in accepting this new position and said that he would do his best to cooperate with the current needs, serve the people, and establish an ideal and beautiful new drama art. In his speech, Zhou Yang emphasized that the construction of new drama should be combined with the tradition of Chinese drama art for hundreds of years, and that we should cherish the heritage of our national art. He said: Cherishing is not passive preservation, but transforming and improving it into an art that is beneficial to the people. The transformation of old art should take cautious steps, and the spirit of bold and courageous reform should be combined with a careful and prudent work attitude.
