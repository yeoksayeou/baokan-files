　　People's Supervisory Committee
    Appoints Supervisory Correspondents
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] The People's Supervisory Committee of the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government, in order to closely connect with and promote mass supervision of state organs and public officials, has decided to appoint enthusiastic staff members from various departments directly under the Central Government, state-owned enterprises, and national people's organizations (labor, youth, women) to serve as supervisory correspondents of the committee. The work of the supervisory correspondents is to regularly understand the violations of policies and laws, corruption and waste, and other acts that harm the interests of the state and the people by public officials, as well as bureaucratism and commandism, and to collect this information and report it to the supervisory committee or assist in its work, so as to promptly correct these shortcomings and errors. These supervisory correspondents must be recommended by various organs and organizations and appointed after being examined and approved by the supervisory committee. The supervisory correspondents serve in a voluntary capacity, but the supervisory committee will provide appropriate subsidies for necessary office expenses incurred in their work; at the same time, those who have made outstanding achievements in their work will be given appropriate commendation and rewards. The People's Supervisory Committee has now issued notices to the above-mentioned organs and organizations, requesting them to recommend supervisory correspondents.
