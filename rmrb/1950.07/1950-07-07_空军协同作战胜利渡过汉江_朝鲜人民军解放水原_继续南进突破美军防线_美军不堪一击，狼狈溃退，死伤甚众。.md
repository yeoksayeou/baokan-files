Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th - The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the evening of the 5th that the People's Army units that liberated Seoul, after eliminating the enemy forces stubbornly resisting in Seoul and the area between Seoul and Suwon, completely liberated Suwon City at 8:20 PM on July 4th. The battle for the People's Army units to liberate Suwon was carried out in extremely difficult circumstances. After the remnants of the enemy forces fleeing from Seoul destroyed the Han River railway bridge, they built defensive positions on the south bank of the Han River and concentrated the remnants of forces fleeing from all fronts, attempting to obstruct the advance of the People's Army. The air fleets of American imperialism and the puppet army attempted to prevent the People's Army from crossing the Han River with intense bombing and artillery fire day after day. However, the infantry, artillery, and tank units of the People's Army, in coordinated operations with the People's Army Air Force, completed the crossing of the river and liberated Suwon City in one fell swoop. In the battle to liberate Suwon, a large number of enemy troops were annihilated and captured, and many spoils of war were seized. Detailed battle results are being tallied. The People's Army units are currently pursuing the fleeing enemy and continuing their southward advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th - The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reported on the evening of the 4th that the air force units of the Republic's People's Army had repelled the American imperialist air force attempting to prevent the People's Army ground forces from advancing south on a wide front, and were covering the People's Army ground forces to continue their advance. The People's Army Air Force also inflicted significant blows on the enemy at the front and behind enemy lines.

American air force formations continue to carry out savage bombing and strafing of peaceful cities and villages in North Korea. At 6:30 AM on the 4th, more than 30 bombers of American imperialism attacked the urban area of Pyongyang, dropping more than 600 bombs, and frantically strafed with rocket launchers and machine guns, causing damage to many civilian houses. Many residents were killed or injured.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The heroic Korean People's Army broke through the defense line of the American aggressor army south of Suwon on the 5th. The American troops were easily defeated, retreating in disarray, with heavy casualties. According to a report from the United Press International from the US military headquarters in Korea on the 6th, "A spokesman for the US military headquarters in Korea said: The American vanguard units encountered at the Suwon front have been partially isolated by the 'Communist Army' (Korean People's Army). Frontline news says: The American positions have been destroyed, and the American troops retreated on Thursday (the 6th) morning with heavy casualties." "The spokesman said: The situation of the battle on Thursday morning cannot be known in more detail because the communication situation is poor."

According to a report from the Associated Press: "An American detachment abandoned its position two miles north of Osan, south of Suwon, on the 5th, leaving behind wounded soldiers and equipment during the retreat. American casualties in this battle reached 15 to 20 percent." The Associated Press stated that the panicked American troops "fired at the Korean People's Army tanks without using sights, but when the tanks crossed them, they retreated and destroyed the artillery." The report stated that survivors who escaped from the front reported that when the American troops retreated, they were attacked by the fire of three People's Army tanks parked on their retreat route, "and had to choose another road" to escape. These survivors said that the battle lasted only seven hours, from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 5th, and the American troops retreated in disarray.

According to the United Press International, the tanks and infantry units of the Korean People's Army on the Suwon front bypassed the American rear, cutting off the American connection with the artillery, and then attacked the American artillery.

As the American troops retreated, the South Korean puppet army also fled in droves. According to an Associated Press report: "Thousands of South Korean soldiers are retreating south from the war zone. These soldiers ran from the mountains to the roads and walked through rice paddies. They flocked to the train stations heading south... Along the road from the front line to the south, the traffic congestion is almost indescribable. Korean troops took all kinds of transportation – bicycles, jeeps, trucks, buses, and tractors. One car of South Korean soldiers was sitting in a car of the Second Section of the US Army Division Headquarters. ... A dozen armored vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and trucks were left on the road. Many trucks and other vehicles rushed into the rice paddies outside the road. Some vehicles overturned, with all four wheels facing the sky. The Koreans removed many unusable vehicle tires, wheels, and other equipment."

    【新华社平壤六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部五日晚发表战报称：解放汉城的人民军部队，在消灭了汉城和汉城水原间地区顽强抵抗的敌军后，已于七月四日下午八时二十分，完全解放水原市。人民军部队解放水原的战斗是在极困难的环境中进行的。自汉城逃窜的敌残余部队将汉江铁桥加以破坏后，在汉江南岸构筑了防御阵地，并集中从各战线上逃来的残余兵力，企图阻挠人民军的前进。美帝国主义的空军机群和伪军连日以猛烈的轰炸与炮火，企图阻止人民军渡过汉江。但人民军的步兵、炮兵、坦克部队在人民军空军部队的协同作战下，完成了渡江，一举解放了水原市。在解放水原的战役中，歼俘敌军甚伙，并缴获许多战利品，详细战果在清查中。人民军部队刻正追击逃敌，继续南进。
    【新华社平壤六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部四日晚报道：共和国人民军空军部队，在广泛的战线上击退了企图阻止人民军地上部队南进的美帝国主义的空军，掩护着人民军地上部队继续挺进。人民军空军部队并在前线与敌后予敌人以重大打击。
    美空军编队继续对北朝鲜的和平城市与农村滥施野兽般的轰炸与扫射。四日晨六时三十分，美帝国主义的轰炸机三十余架袭击平壤市区，投弹六百余枚，并以火箭炮与机关炮疯狂扫射，致使许多民房遭到破坏。居民伤亡甚众。
    【新华社六日讯】英勇的朝鲜人民军已于五日在水原以南突破美国侵略者陆军的防线，美军不堪一击，狼狈溃退，死伤甚重。据合众社朝鲜美军总部六日电称，“朝鲜美军总部发言人说：水原前线遭遇到迂回的美国先头部队已部分为共军（朝鲜人民军）所孤立。前线消息说：美军阵地已被摧毁，美军星期四（六日）晨已后撤，死伤甚众”。“发言人说：星期四晨战事的情形不能更详细知道，因为通信情形不佳。”
    另据美联社消息称：“美军一个分队已于五日放弃水原南乌山以北二英里的阵地，撤退时丢下了伤兵和装备。此役美军死伤达百分之十五至二十。”美联社称：张慌失措的美军“不用瞄准器迳向朝鲜人民军的坦克车射击，但当坦克越过他们时，他们就撤退，并把大炮破坏。”该消息称：自前线逃出的幸存者报告：当美军撤退时，他们又遭到停于他们退路上的三辆人民军坦克车炮火的攻击，“不得不另择一条路”逃跑。这些幸存者说：战斗自五日八时开始至下午三时止，仅打了七小时美军即狼狈溃退。
    据合众社称：水原前线的朝鲜人民军的坦克和步兵部队是迂回至美军后方，切断了美军与炮兵的联系，然后攻击美军炮兵。
    随着美军的溃退，南朝鲜傀儡军都蜂涌逃命。美联社消息称：“数千南朝鲜兵都从战区向南撤退。这些兵士从山上跑到公路上，穿过稻田行走，他们涌至开往南部的火车站………沿着从前线往南的公路，交通拥挤的状况几乎不可以言语形容。朝鲜的军队乘上各种交通工具——自行车、吉普车、卡车、公共汽车和拖拉机。有一车南朝鲜兵坐在美军师本部二科的车内。……十来辆装甲车、铁甲载人车和卡车丢在路上，许多卡车和其他车辆冲到道路外面的稻田里，一些辆车子翻了身，四个轮子朝天。朝鲜人把许多不能使用的车辆的橡皮轮胎、车轮和其他设备取下来。”
