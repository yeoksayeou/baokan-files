　　Wall Street Journal Comments: U.S. Foreign Policy Has Dire Consequences
　　Aggression Against Korea Will Inevitably Increase National Budget
　　[Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 17th] (TASS) - An article published by Evans in the Wall Street Journal depicts the inevitable and dire consequences of the current U.S. foreign policy. According to Evans, U.S. intervention in Korea means that the U.S. is undertaking an extremely unenviable task from a military, economic, and propaganda point of view.
　　Evans pointed out that the impact of these developments on the U.S. economy, especially its budget, cannot be ignored. He said: The Korean War alone must increase the national budget by billions of dollars.
　　Evans said: If we are to maintain our armed forces around the world, it will cost us many more billions of dollars. And we must also re-equip the armies of the countries where our troops are stationed.
　　Evans believes that sending American troops to Korea, where there is not a single Soviet soldier, and sending troops to other countries at a time when the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from various locations, will not only damage the reputation of the United States, but also provide persuasive arguments for propaganda against the United States.

　　华尔街日报评论：美外交政策后果凄惨
    侵略朝鲜必增加国家预算
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：伊文思在华尔街日报上发表的文章，描绘出美国当前外交政策的必然的凄惨的后果。在伊文思看起来，美国干涉朝鲜意味着美国担负起从军事及经济角度和宣传观点看都是极端无可羡慕的任务。
    伊文思指出，这些发展对美国的经济特别是对其预算的影响，是不能予以忽视的。他说：单是朝鲜战争即必须增加国家预算数十亿美元。
    伊文思说：如果要在全世界维持我们的武装部队，那就要使我们花费更多的几十亿美元。并且我们也必须重新装备我们军队的驻在国的军队。
    伊文思认为，派遣美国军队到没有苏联一兵一卒的朝鲜去，并且在苏联已自各处撤退其军队的时候派遣军队到其他国家去，这不但会损害美国的声望，而且也会为反对美国的宣传提供具有说服力的论据。
