　　Answering Comrade Zhao Fajun's Questions on Carrying Gold and Silver

　　Comrade Zhao Fajun:
    Regarding your question, "On June 12th, two family members of military personnel were carrying gold and silver from Shenyang to Hankou. They were discovered at Liulihe Station and sent to the public security organ. Why were they released after producing supporting documents?" The People's Bank of China has responded as follows:
    Article 5 of the North China Region Gold and Silver Management Measures stipulates that "Those carrying gold and silver from other liberated areas through this region should have a certificate from the government above the regional level in the original area." The public security personnel at the station, seeing the certificate, released them, which is in accordance with the aforementioned regulations. The spirit of the People's Government's policy on gold and silver is: People are allowed to possess gold and silver and exchange them for RMB at state banks. If it is necessary to carry them due to relocation, an application should be made to the government above the district level for a certificate. However, it is strictly forbidden to use them for pricing and circulation, replacing currency, or engaging in private transactions that disrupt the financial order.

　　关于携带金银问题答兆发君问兆发君：
    所问“六月十二日有军属二名，携带金银，由沈阳到汉口，在琉璃河车站被发现送公安机关后，因有证明文件，何以把二人放了”，此事经中国人民银行答复如下：
    查华北区金银管理办法第五条，有“自其他解放区携带金银途经本区者应有原地区级以上政府证明”之规定。车站公安人员，对于带有此项证明文件者，遂予放行，自与前项规定符合。人民政府对金银政策的精神是：金银准许人民储有及持向国家银行兑换人民币。如因迁移需携带者，应向区级以上政府申请发给证明文件。但严禁用以计价行使，代替通货及私相买卖等扰乱金融的行为。
