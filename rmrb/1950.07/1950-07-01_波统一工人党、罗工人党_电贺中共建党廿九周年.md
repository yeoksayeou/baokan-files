To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

On the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, please accept our heartfelt congratulations.

The working people of Poland are well acquainted with your party – the party that grew from the seeds of the great October Revolution – leading the Chinese people in their heroic struggle for freedom and independence. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, this struggle culminated in the glorious triumph of the Chinese people.

On the occasion of the 29th anniversary of your Party's birth, we wish you continued success in practicing Lenin-Stalinism – in the struggle to consolidate the permanent alliance of workers and peasants.

Every victory of yours strengthens the camp of peace defenders worldwide, headed by the Soviet Union – the bastion of freedom and independence for the working people.

                                    The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, sent a telegram congratulating the Communist Party of China on its 29th anniversary. The telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party of China:

On the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, to extend to you warm fraternal congratulations.

The Communist Party of China, armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and based on the historical experience of the Soviet working class's outstanding Bolshevik Party, led the Chinese working people and their allies to the victory of the Chinese revolution.

The Chinese people, led by the working class, are confidently advancing along the path of restoring and developing the national economy, and the living standards of the working people are steadily improving under the leadership of the seasoned Communist Party of China. The friendship and close cooperation between China, the great Soviet Union, and the new democratic countries are developing and consolidating, which means the strengthening of the forces of the people of the world in the struggle for peace and democracy and against the instigators of war of Anglo-American imperialism.

Long live the heroic Communist Party of China!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Communist Party of China!

Long live the respected father of the working people of the world – the genius Stalin!

    【新华社三十日讯】波兰统一工人党中央委员会电贺中国共产党中央委员会建党二十九周年。电文如下：中国共产党中央委员会：
    欣逢中国共产党建党二十九周年纪念日，谨致以衷心的祝贺。
    波兰的劳动人民很熟悉你们的党——由伟大的十月革命的种子长成的党——所领导的中国人民为争取自由与独立而进行的英勇斗争。在毛泽东同志领导之下，这一斗争就以中国人民之辉煌凯旋而告成。
    兹值贵党二十九周年诞生之日，我们祝贺你们今后在实践列宁斯大林学说——巩固工人和农民的永久同盟的斗争中，继续取得胜利。
    你们的每一胜利，同时也就增强着以苏联——劳动人民自由与独立的堡垒——为首的全世界和平捍卫者的阵营。

    【新华社三十日讯】罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌·德治电贺中国共产党建党二十九周年。电文如下：中国共产党主席毛泽东同志：
    欣逢中国共产党建党二十九周年之际，请允许代表罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会向你致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    以马列主义理论武装起来的中国共产党，依据苏联工人阶级的卓越的布尔什维克党的历史经验，领导着中国劳动人民及其同盟者取得了中国革命的胜利。
    以工人阶级为首的中国人民正充满信心沿着恢复和发展国民经济的道路前进，劳动人民的生活水准在久经锻炼的中国共产党领导下，日益提高。中国、伟大的苏联以及新民主主义国家之间的友谊与亲密合作在发展和巩固中，这意味着全世界人民为争取和平与民主而斗争、以及反对英美帝国主义的战争的挑拨者而斗争的力量的增强。
    英勇的中国共产党万岁！
    中国共产党英明的领导者毛泽东同志万岁！
    全世界劳动人民爱戴的尊敬的父亲——天才的斯大林万岁！
