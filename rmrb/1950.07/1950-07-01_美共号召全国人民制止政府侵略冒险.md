Xinhua News Agency, New York, 30th: The Secretariat of the Communist Party of the United States issued a call to the American people, denouncing Truman's military order to send bombers and warships to interfere in the Korean people's affairs as "a brutal act of imperialist aggression by Wall Street seeking to seize hegemony over all of Asia and the Pacific. ... The military provocation in Korea is planned as a smokescreen to interfere in the struggles for independence waged by the people of Korea, China, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, and Malaya. ... Wall Street's puppet governments in Asia are rapidly collapsing because the self-respecting people of the Pacific countries are moving towards liberation. Therefore, the American imperialists have decided to step in to support the collapsing positions of Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Bao Dai."

The Communist Party of the United States emphasized in its call that these war actions by Wall Street's armed interventionists are solely for the benefit of big industrialists and bankers, while the will and interests of the American people are for peace. "The two-party bloc has only one goal: to conquer the people of Asia, plunder their natural resources, and increase the huge corporate profits derived from the conquered regions of the world. This policy will bring disaster to the American people."

The call further stated: "Truman's destructive policies mean only an ocean of suffering for the American people, just as they have already meant an ocean of suffering for the people of Korea and other Asian countries. These policies will not only bring disaster to our people, but will also put the whole world in danger. Therefore, those representatives of the United Nations Security Council who shamelessly and hastily acted according to the instructions of Wall Street representatives should be condemned by the world.

"The actions of the United Nations Security Council are another smokescreen to cover up the actions of the two-party bloc. What those puppets who are obedient to American big business are doing is to further conceal the truth, anesthetize the American people and the people of the world, so that the bankers-generals can get away with murder."

The Communist Party calls on the American people to demand that the government stop its military aggressive adventures, and to fully support the heroic struggles of the people of Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaya for their unification, independence, and liberation.

"No intervention in Korea. No interference in the Korean people's right to a free, unified, and independent Korea. Demand the immediate withdrawal of American warships and air force, and stop sending arms to the Syngman Rhee puppet government. Not a penny, a cannon, or a plane to Wall Street's puppet regimes in Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina."

　　美共号召全国人民制止政府侵略冒险
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约三十日讯：美国共产党书记处向美国人民发表号召，痛斥杜鲁门遣送轰炸机与军舰干涉朝鲜人民的军事命令，是“华尔街妄图攫取全亚洲和太平洋霸权的冒险的帝国主义的残酷侵略行动。……朝鲜的军事挑衅是计划作为烟幕来干涉朝鲜、中国、菲律宾、越南、印度与马来亚人民进行的争取独立的斗争的。……华尔街在亚洲的傀儡政府正在迅速崩溃，因为太平洋各国的自尊的人民正向着解放前进。因此美国的帝国主义者决定出面干涉，来支持李承晚、蒋介石、保大的正在崩溃中的地位。”
    美国共产党在号召中强调指出华尔街武装干涉者的这些战争行动仅仅是为了大工业家和银行家的利益，而美国人民的意志和利益则是争取和平。“两党集团只有一个目的：征服亚洲人民，掠夺他们的天然资源，增殖从世界上被征服的地区得来的巨额企业利润。这种政策会为美国人民带来灾祸。”
    号召进一步说：“杜鲁门的破坏政策对于美国人民来说，只意味着苦难的海洋，正如它们对朝鲜和亚洲其他国家人民已意味着苦难的海洋一样。这些政策不仅会为我们人民带来灾祸，而且会使全世界处于危险的境地。所以那些无耻地匆匆遵照华尔街代表的嘱咐行事的联合国安理会代表们应受世界的谴责。
    “联合国安理会的行动是掩护两党集团的行动的又一烟幕。那些听命于美国大企业的傀儡们所做的是进一步隐瞒真相，麻醉美国人民和全世界的人民，以便银行家——将军们在杀人后可以逍遥法外。”
    共产党号召美国人民要求政府停止军事侵略冒险，并且充分支持朝鲜、中国、菲律宾、印尼、越南与马来亚的人民进行他们的争取统一、独立与解放的英勇斗争。
    “不干涉朝鲜。不干涉朝鲜人民获得自由、统一及独立的朝鲜的权利。要求立即撤退美国军舰与空军，并停止运送军火给李承晚傀儡政府。不给华尔街在朝鲜、台湾及印度支那的傀儡政权一分钱、一门炮或一架飞机。”
