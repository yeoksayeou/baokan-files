　　The Tangshan Railway Factory Tool Shop Party Branch Committee has some serious problems in its leadership, which has greatly reduced the Party's prestige among the masses and deprived it of its role in guaranteeing and supervising production.

　　Many of the negative work styles of the branch leadership are concentrated in Xu Rongshan, the branch's propaganda committee member. Xu Rongshan is arrogant, self-righteous, demands extreme democracy from superiors but is dictatorial to subordinates, does not humbly accept others' opinions, and casually accuses others of "weak party spirit and unstable stance." Therefore, party members are afraid to offer him suggestions. Once, party member Shi Baoting gave him a suggestion, which he ignored. When Shi Baoting reported the suggestion to the Party Committee, Xu Rongshan criticized him for violating organizational principles by reporting beyond his level. At a branch general meeting, Zhang Enjiu, the organization committee member, offered Xu Rongshan a suggestion, and Xu Rongshan waved his hand and dismissed the meeting. In this situation, when the branch assigns work to party members, it only subjectively and rigidly hands over the task to everyone, without providing the necessary explanations or mobilizations. Party members do not fully understand the spirit of the tasks they receive, and errors often occur in their work. These deviations should and could have been avoided.

　　The Branch Committee has adopted a principle of unconditional accommodation towards Xu Rongshan. For example, in February of this year, when the Branch Committee discussed the issue of probationary party member Li Shijie becoming a full party member, Branch Secretary Li Yantang (now studying at a vocational school) and Organization Committee Member Zhang Enjiu believed that Li Shijie was active in his work and performed well in all aspects, and agreed to his conversion to full membership. However, Xu Rongshan disagreed. Because the Branch Secretary and the Organization Committee Member failed to adhere to principles, even though two of the three Branch Committee members agreed, the proposal was still not passed. They completely forgot the Party's organizational principle of the minority submitting to the majority. Li Shijie's issue has been delayed until now and remains unresolved. On the other hand, the Branch Committee members, especially Xu Rongshan, often do not raise their opinions at meetings, but instead speak ill of others behind their backs, and not only within the Party, but even among the masses. This has led to disunity among Branch Committee members, party members, and the masses. In this situation, the Party's organizational life is lax and discipline is neglected. Organization Committee Member Zhang Enjiu (the administrative director of the tool shop) only reports situations to the factory director, and not to the branch. Party members are dissatisfied with the Branch Committee, but are afraid to offer suggestions. Group meetings do not resolve problems. Some party members do not participate at all, and those who do simply chat for a few words and then dismiss the meeting. The Branch Committee has also adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the Party's development work. Veteran worker Zheng Wencan (over fifty years old this year, who has been working since he was eighteen), has been active in his work since liberation, and feels that the Communist Party is truly a party that seeks the welfare of the people. He applied to join the Party last December and submitted his application form to the Branch. But until now, the Branch has not responded. The Branch does not pay attention to recruiting outstanding individuals who already have a considerable level of awareness in the factory into the Party. What makes the masses most dissatisfied is that during the job evaluation and salary determination last year, Xu Rongshan secretly changed his and Zhang Enjiu's scores (later changed back). When the Party made a public call, the entire factory's workers worked overtime to offer gifts to the Party, but individual comrades in the Branch, because they could not make anything, took a finished product made in the past as a gift. The masses are very dissatisfied with this, believing that it is not appropriate for party members to do this. Most of the party members in the shop were originally very active, and had never lagged behind other shops in completing production tasks. In giving up the year-end bonus and in the challenge competition, party members took the lead. However, under the leadership of this Branch, the enthusiasm of the party members has slowly waned. In this way, the Branch naturally cannot play a role in guaranteeing and supervising production.

　　After discovering these situations, the Railway Factory Party Committee also held meetings to give criticism and education. However, because the problems were not resolved from the ideological perspective of the Branch Committee, especially Xu Rongshan, the work of the Branch has not changed much. Serious erroneous thoughts and work styles are still corroding the Party. The Factory Party Committee should continue to strengthen its leadership over the Branch, promote intra-party democracy, launch criticism and self-criticism, and widely listen to the opinions of the masses, so that the work of the Branch can be quickly improved.

### 唐山铁路工厂工具场支委  拒绝批评压制党内民主

　　唐山铁路工厂工具场支委
    拒绝批评压制党内民主
    唐山铁路工厂工具场支部委员会的领导上存在着若干严重问题，因此党在群众中的威信大大降低，失掉了它对生产的保证与监督作用。
    支部领导上的许多不良作风集中表现在支部宣传委员徐荣山身上。徐荣山在工作中自高自大、自以为是，对上要求极端民主、对下专制，不虚心接受别人的意见，还随便给人扣帽子，说别人“党性不强，立场不稳”。因此，党员都不敢给他提意见。有一次党员石宝亭向他提意见，他置之不理。当石宝亭把意见汇报给党委时，徐荣山就批评他越级汇报是违反组织原则的。在一次支部大会上，组织委员张恩久给徐荣山提意见，徐荣山就挥手叫大家散会。在这种情况下，支部给党员布置工作时，也就只是主观的生硬地把任务交给大家；而不向大家作必要的解释动员。党员对所接受的任务的精神领会不够，工作中也就常出偏差。而这些偏差原是应该并且也可以避免的。
    支委会曾对徐荣山是采取了无原则的迁就。例如今年二月间支委会讨论候补党员李士杰的转为正式党员的问题时，支书李延棠（现去职校学习）、组织委员张恩久认为李士杰工作积极，各方面表现都很好，同意转正。但是徐荣山不同意。由于支书和组织委员不能坚持原则，虽然三个支委中已有两个同意，结果仍然没有通过。完全忘记了党的少数服从多数的组织原则。李士杰的问题一直拖到现在仍未解决。另一方面，支委中、特别是徐荣山，常常是有意见不在会上提出来，而背后乱说，并且不仅在党内乱说，甚至到群众中乱说。弄得支委、党员和群众谁和谁也不团结。在这种情况下，党的组织生活松懈，纪律废弛。组织委员张恩久（工具场的行政主任），有情况就只向厂长汇报，而不向支部汇报。党员对支委不满，但又不敢提意见。小组会也不解决问题，有些党员根本不参加，参加了的，也只是闲扯几句就散会。对于党的发展工作，支委会也采取了不负责任的态度。老工友郑文灿（今年五十多岁，十八岁就作工），解放后工作积极，感到共产党真正是为人民谋福利的党。去年十二月他就申请入党并填写了入党志愿书交到支部。但直到现在支部未作答复。对于工厂中已经有相当觉悟的优秀分子，支部也不注意吸收入党。最使群众不满的是去年评职评薪时，徐荣山偷改自己和张恩久的分数（后又改回）。党公开时，全场工友加工加班给党献礼，而支部中个别同志因做不出来，拿了一件过去做出的成品作了献礼。群众对此非常不满，认为党员这样做是太不应该的。该场大部分党员原是很积极的，在完成生产任务上从未落在别场后面。在放弃年终奖金及挑战竞赛中，党员都打了第一炮。但在支部这样的领导下，党员的热情慢慢消沉下去了。这样支部自然谈不上在生产中起保证和监督作用了。
    铁路工厂党委发现这些情况后，也曾召开会议，给予批评教育。但由于未从支委特别是徐荣山的思想上解决问题，支部工作仍没有多大转变。严重的错误思想和作风依然在腐蚀着党。该厂党委会应继续加强对该支部的领导，发扬党内民主，展开批评与自我批评，广泛地听取群众意见，使支部工作得以很快改进。
