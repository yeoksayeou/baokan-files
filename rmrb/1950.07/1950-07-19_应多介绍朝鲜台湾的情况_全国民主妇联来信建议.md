　　Should Introduce More Information on Korea and Taiwan
    Letter of Suggestion from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the Editors:
    At the ministerial joint meeting convened by the All-China Women's Federation on the 12th, a special discussion was held on the Korean issue, and many comrades and the masses expressed their opinions and views on this issue. The main concern was the issue of liberating Taiwan. Finally, everyone proposed that it is hoped that newspapers and broadcasts can systematically and continuously publish introductions to Taiwan and Korea, and it is hoped that popular booklets or maps can be compiled and distributed to the masses, especially in the newly liberated areas.
                                All-China Democratic Women's Federation
                                               July 13
    Editor's Note: The suggestion from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation is very correct. According to the call of the Chinese People's Committee Against U.S. Aggression in Taiwan and Korea, the national news and propaganda agencies are being mobilized to publicize and explain a series of issues related to U.S. aggression in Taiwan and Korea to the people of the whole country. This publicity and explanation work must be carried out in-depth and universally. In the new areas, even more arduous ideological education work must be carried out. It is necessary to make the people of the whole country clearly understand that: on the one hand, U.S. imperialism is the enemy of world peace and the enemy of the Chinese people, and on the other hand, it is a paper tiger.

　　应多介绍朝鲜台湾的情况
    全国民主妇联来信建议编辑同志：
    十二日全国妇联所召开之部长联席会议上，曾对朝鲜问题做了专门的讨论，大家并反映了不少其他同志及群众对此问题之意见及看法，最主要的是关心解放台湾的问题，最后大家提议希望能够在报纸上及广播中做到有系统地连续登载一些有关台湾及朝鲜问题的介绍，并希望能够编印一些通俗小册子或地图，发给群众，尤其是在新解放区。
                                中华全国民主妇女联合会
                                               七月十三日
    编者按：全国民主妇联这个建议是很正确的。根据中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会的号召，全国的新闻宣传机关正在动员起来，向全国人民宣传解释有关美国侵略台湾朝鲜的一系列的问题。这一宣传解释工作，必须作得深入，作得普遍。在新区更须作艰苦的思想教育工作。要使全国人民都清楚地懂得：美帝国主义一方面是世界和平的敌人，是中国人民的敌人，另一方面，它又是一只纸老虎。
