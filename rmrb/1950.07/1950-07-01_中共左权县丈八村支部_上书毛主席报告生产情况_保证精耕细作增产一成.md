Comrades of the Zhangba Village Branch of the CCP in Zuoquan County,
A Letter to Chairman Mao Reporting on Production

Guaranteeing Intensive Farming and Cultivation to Increase Production by 10%

Dear Chairman Mao:

We are a group of farmers. On this year's Communist Party birthday, we want to briefly report our work to you.

Last winter, Comrade Sun Chengyin from our village and farmer representatives from Shanxi Province visited the industrial exhibition in Tianjin, and later went to Beijing and met you. You told us: We must develop production well, just like growing pumpkins, so that they grow bigger year by year. Comrade Sun Chengyin told all the cadres and masses in the county what you instructed. All the comrades of our branch were particularly happy to hear this and felt it was an honor for the entire branch. Everyone unanimously said that they would resolutely listen to you and lead production well.

After the county and district party representative conferences and after studying at the Party School, the comrades initially understood the laws of social development. They know that the war has been won, land reform has been implemented in many areas, and now leading production is revolution. Only by properly leading the peasants to organize, improve productivity, and carry out production and construction can we move towards a new society. Therefore, all party members have become active. Last year, only eleven of the twenty-two party members worked actively, but this year eighteen are working actively.

Our administrative village has three natural villages (Zhangba, Zhangbagou, Wangyangnao), which were very poor in the past, and the land was scarce and of poor quality. The whole village only has sixty mu of "xiang (good) flat land". In the past, the exploitation and oppression by landlords was very severe. Many households had no houses, no land, no clothes, and nothing to eat. Over the past ten years, the Party has led the people to reduce rent and eliminate debt, and everyone has gradually turned over. Through land reform and large-scale production, the lives of the common people have become even better. The poor peasants and hired laborers have all become middle peasants, with enough to eat and wear. Now, men, women, old and young in the village are all working, and there are no thieves or beggars. The common people no longer believe in superstition. Quarrels have also decreased. Last year, the village's agricultural production exceeded the pre-war level. Before the war, Zhangba natural village produced 1.2 shi per mu, but last year the actual output was 1.18 shi per mu. This year, we will also repair more land, improve technology, and increase fertilizer, planning to increase production by another 10% on the existing basis.

This year, the branch's method of leading production is different from last year. Last year, the branch committee members divided work by village and area. This year, we unite all cadres and organize various guidance groups to specifically lead the work according to the focus of each stage of work. The phenomenon of the Party and government not being separated has been initially overcome. This year, not even one mass meeting was held, so that the common people could use their time to tend to their crops. The cadres also visited door-to-door, inspected on the spot, and carried out mass mutual inspection movements to solve specific difficulties. This year, the village particularly emphasized technical leadership and specially organized a technical committee, while also carrying out a movement to respect the old and love the young and impart technology. In every task, party members take the lead in demonstrating and uniting the masses. This year, we also paid attention to cultivating and utilizing activists.

This year, the village rectified the mutual aid groups, so that everyone can "meet people with people, and hearts with hearts". Of the one hundred and fourteen households in the village, one hundred and four households participated in mutual aid, totaling sixteen groups. The mutual aid groups generally pay attention to improving technology, and the labor force in the group is divided according to technical conditions in the work of building embankments and sowing seeds, and everyone is very satisfied. This year, 84% of all female labor has participated in production (only one person in Zhangba village did not participate), pulling ge la, hoeing edges, slipping seeds, and weeding seedlings, almost doing the same work as men. The original plan was to add two pieces of farm tools per household, but it turned out to be three pieces. Last year, 37 dan of manure was applied per mu, this year the plan is 50 dan, and finally an average of 51 dan was applied per mu. Seventeen households with serious insect pests were also organized to buy 15 jin of red alum and apply it to more than 100 mu of land. In addition, more than 30 mu of wasteland was reclaimed; now the seedlings are growing very well. This year, there is a lot of rain and a lot of grass. We must organize all the labor force to hoe more and hoe carefully to ensure increased production. This year, the corn must be hoeed four times, and the millet must be hoeed three times. The miscellaneous fields were hoeed twice last year, but this year they will also be hoeed three times.

Our biggest shortcomings in our work are imbalances. For example, some individual party members are still not active, and there is a big difference between one natural village and another. We have already made self-criticisms. In the future, we will strengthen criticism and self-criticism to make every party member active. We will unite and cultivate more activists and push forward the work of the backward Wangyangnao natural village. In addition, our political and cultural level is still not very high, and we have little experience. We must work hard to learn in the future.

Now the cities and industries belong to the people, and we must lead the farmers of the whole village to work hard to produce more grain and supply them. We also hope that they will manufacture more agricultural machines to help us develop agriculture. Dear Chairman Mao! We will resolutely implement what you have called for, instructed, and personally told us, and we guarantee to implement the Party's policies and disciplines and the government's laws and regulations, and do a good job in both work and study.

We wish you eternal health!

All Party Members of the Zhangba Village Branch in Zuoquan

### 中共左权县丈八村支部  上书毛主席报告生产情况  保证精耕细作增产一成

　　中共左权县丈八村支部
    上书毛主席报告生产情况
    保证精耕细作增产一成亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是一伙农民。在今年共产党的生日，我们要把自己的工作简单地向你报告一下。
    去年冬天，我村的孙成寅同志和山西全省农民代表到天津参观工业展览，后来又到北京，见到了你。你告诉我们：要好好发展生产，就好比种南瓜一样，要它结得一年比一年大。孙成寅同志把你嘱咐的话告诉了全县干部和群众。我们支部全体同志听了后，都特别高兴，觉得是全支部的光荣。大家一致说要坚决听你的话，好好领导生产。
    经过县区党代表大会，经过党校的学习后，同志们初步懂得了社会发展的规律；知道战争胜利了，好些地区并实行了土地改革，现在领导生产就是革命。只有好好领导农民组织起来，提高生产力，进行生产建设，才能走到新社会。因此全体党员大都积极起来了。在去年，二十二个党员中，积极工作的只有十一个，今年有十八个都积极工作了。
    我们的行政村共有三个自然村（丈八、丈八沟、望阳垴），过去都很穷，土地又少又不好。全村只有六十亩“响（好）平地”。从前受地主剥削和压迫很厉害。许多户都没有房、没有地，没得穿、没得吃。这十多年，党领导人民，减租清债，大家逐渐翻了身。经过土地改革和大生产，老百姓的生活更好了。贫雇农全部上升为中农，有吃有穿。现在村里男女老小齐劳动，没有一个小偷或讨吃的。老百姓都不讲迷信。闹气吵架的事情也少了。去年全村农业生产已超过战前水平。战前丈八自然村每亩产一石零二升，去年每亩实产一石一斗八升。我们今年还要多修地、提高技术、增加肥料，计划在现有基础上再增产一成。
    今年支部领导生产的方法和去年不一样：去年支委按村按片分工；今年团结全体干部，根据每个阶段的工作重心，组织各种指导组来具体领导工作。党政不分的一揽子现象初步克服了。今年一次群众大会也没开，让老百姓把工夫都用来侍弄庄稼。干部们还登门访问，实地检查，开展群众性的互查运动，解决具体困难。今年村里特别重视技术领导，专门组织了技术委员会，同时开展了尊老爱青，传授技术运动。每件工作，党员都带头示范，团结群众。我们今年还注意培养和运用积极分子。
    今年村里整顿了互助组，使大家做到“人碰人，心碰心”。全村一一四户，有一○四户参加了互助，共十六组。互助组大都注意提高技术，组内劳力在垒堰和下种工作中都按技术条件分工，大家都很满意。今年全部妇女劳力的百分之八十四，都参加了生产（丈八村只有一人没参加），拉圪拉、刨边、溜籽、锄苗，差不多和男人一样干。原计划每户增添农具两件，结果增到三件。去年每亩上粪三十七担，今年计划上五十担，最后每亩平均上五十一担。还组织了受虫害比较严重的十七户，买红矾十五斤，上地一百多亩。另外还开荒三十多亩；现在小苗都长得很好。今年雨多草大，我们要组织全部劳力，做到多锄、细锄，保证增产。今年玉茭要全部锄四遍，谷子全部锄三遍。杂田去年锄两遍，今年也要锄三遍。
    我们工作中的最大缺点是不平衡。例如个别党员还不积极，这个自然村与那个自然村相差很远。我们已作了检讨。今后我们要加强批评和自我批评，使每个党员都积极起来。多多团结、培养积极分子，把落后的望阳垴自然村的工作，推进一步。另外我们政治文化水平还很不高，经验也少，今后还得努力学习。
    现在的城市和工业都是人民的了，我们一定要领导全村农民努力生产，多打粮食，供给他们。也希望他们多多制造农业机器，帮助我们发展农业。亲爱的毛主席！你号召、指示和亲自告诉我们的，我们都坚决执行，并保证执行党的政策纪律和政府法令，把工作和学习都搞好。
    祝你永远健康！
    左权丈八村支部全体党员
