    Implement the State Council's Instructions:
    Various Regions Vigorously Carry Out Work-Relief Programs;
    Some Shortcomings Must Be Corrected Promptly;
    Conscientiously Do a Good Job of Relieving Unemployed Workers!
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Across the country, work to relieve unemployed workers is being earnestly carried out. According to the State Council's instructions on relieving unemployed workers, after distributing a large amount of relief grain and providing emergency relief, various regions are now, primarily through work-relief programs, systematically and step-by-step organizing temporarily surplus labor into various construction projects to solve their current livelihood difficulties. In the East China region, after more than 427,000 unemployed workers (including family members) received emergency relief, more than 28,700 people have already participated in work-relief labor. The first batch of work-relief projects in Shanghai, starting on June 15th, mainly involves the construction of four parks and three nurseries. In Nanjing, an Unemployed Workers Relief Committee was established on June 22nd, and in late June, a second batch of 55,000 catties of emergency relief grain was distributed. Currently, more than 2,500 unemployed workers have been organized to participate in levee repair projects in the Pukou area. In the Central South region, Wuhan City has had more than 2,000 unemployed workers participating in construction projects from June 17th to the end of June. The city is currently conducting large-scale project preparations, and it is estimated that all projects can accommodate 30,000 workers, of which the construction of the Wujindi and Wuqingdi embankments alone will require 6,000 workers. Chongqing City is preparing to organize a large number of unemployed workers to participate in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Other cities such as Guangzhou, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Guilin, and Kunming are also actively resolving the problem of unemployed workers through work-relief programs. Workers participating in work-relief labor in various regions can generally receive three to six catties of rice per day as wages, which can maintain their livelihood.
    In addition to work-relief as the main method, various regions are also widely using methods such as production for self-relief, vocational training, returning to their hometowns for production, and issuing relief funds to relieve unemployed workers. In terms of production for self-relief, various regions have adopted methods such as providing loans and issuing self-relief funds to organize transportation and sales or production groups. Among them, the Shanghai Hardware Production Cooperative Factory, organized by unemployed workers, has achieved outstanding results, growing from an initial 300 people to more than 1,000 people. In terms of returning to their hometowns for production, under the principle of worker voluntariness, various regions have provided return travel expenses for the workers and their families. In terms of vocational training, Shanghai, Hankou, Nanyang and other places have established unemployed worker training classes. The Shanghai Unemployed Shop Assistants Training Class started on June 26th, with more than 3,000 temporarily unemployed shop assistants participating in the training to improve workers' political awareness and preserve worker strength.
    Solving the problem of unemployed workers is a long-term and arduous task. Although some achievements have been made in the work of relieving unemployed workers, there are also some shortcomings: (1) Some unemployed workers in Zhengzhou, Wuhan and other places are unwilling to register. According to Wuhan, there are about 50,000 unemployed and semi-unemployed workers. As of June 23rd, only more than 3,300 unemployed workers were registered by the industrial trade union because they still had ideological concerns: "afraid of being conscripted after eating the grain" or "afraid of not being able to repay the government when it asks for it back." This fact shows that the propaganda and education work is still far from adequate, and it will also affect the government's planned relief work. (2) Relief work must be carried out step-by-step, with planning, investigation, and research, to avoid chaos. In the past, when dealing with the problem of unemployed workers, Xi'an lacked a unified organization, and unemployed workers requested job introductions from both the Labor Bureau and the Ministry of Labor, as well as the Northwest General Trade Union, resulting in chaos. Some cadres in Wuhan responsible for registration work were unfamiliar with the business, unclear about the scope of registration, and afraid to take responsibility, which greatly affected the registration work. In some areas, due to a lack of investigation and research, the relief grain was distributed unfairly, which also caused dissatisfaction among unemployed workers. (3) The purpose of relief is to help workers overcome temporary difficulties, preserve worker strength, and prepare to put them into production. Therefore, working cadres must prevent the simplistic "relief" viewpoint, and at the same time, they should also prevent the "engineering" viewpoint of being too strict in selecting relief recipients. They must follow the principles, distinguish the severity and urgency, and use different methods to solve the problems for different recipients.

　　贯彻执行政务院指示
    各地大力进行以工代赈
    还有一些缺点必须及时改正
    认真做好救济失业工人！
    【本报讯】全国各地认真展开救济失业工人的工作。根据政务院关于救济失业工人的指示，各地在发放大量救济食粮，进行了紧急救济以后，现正通过以工代赈为主的办法，有计划有步骤地将暂时剩余劳动力组织到各项建设工程中，以解决他们当前的生活困难。华东区四十二万七千多失业工人（包括家属）得到紧急救济后，已有二万八千七百多人参加工赈劳动。上海第一批以工代赈的工程，从六月十五日开始，主要是修筑四个公园和三个苗圃。南京在六月二十二日成立失业工人救济委员会，六月下旬发出第二次紧急救济粮五万五千斤，现已组织了两千五百多失业工人参加了浦口一带的修堤工程。中南区的武汉市，从六月十七日起至六月底止已有二千多失业工人参加工程建设。该市目前正进行大规模的工程准备工作，估计全部工程可容三万工人，其中仅武金堤和武青堤的修筑即需六千工人。重庆市准备组织大批失业工人进行成渝铁路的修筑工程。其他如广州、西安、郑州、开封、济南、青岛、杭州、无锡、桂林、昆明等城市也纷纷通过以工代赈的办法解决失业工人的问题。各地参加工赈劳动的工人，每天一般均可得到三斤到六斤米的工资，生活也可维持。
    除以工代赈的主要办法以外，各地又广泛地以生产自救、转业训练、还乡生产、发救济金等办法来救济失业工人。在生产自救方面，各地分别采取贷款及发给自救金等方式，组织运销或生产小组，其中成绩突出的，是上海失业工人所组织的五金生产合作工厂，该厂已由最初的三百人增至一千余人。在回乡生产方面，在工人自愿的原则下，各地对回乡者均发给了本人及其家属回乡路费。在转业训练方面，上海、汉口、南阳等地都成立了失业工人学习班，上海失业店员学习班在六月二十六日开学，有三千多暂时失业的店员参加学习，借以提高工人政治认识，保存工人力量。
    解决失业工人问题，是长期而艰巨的工作。目前在救济失业工人工作上虽有一些成绩，但也存在着若干缺点：（一）郑州、武汉等地一部分失业工人不愿登记。按武汉失业和半失业工人约有五万，截至六月二十三日止，产业工会登记的失业工人仅有三千三百多人。因为他们还有思想顾虑：“怕吃了粮叫当兵”，或者“怕政府再要时，还不起”。从这一事实说明，宣传教育工作还做的很是不够，同时也将影响政府去有计划地进行救济工作。（二）救济工作必须有步骤，有计划，有调查，有研究，才能避免紊乱。西安过去处理失业工人问题时，由于没有统一的组织，失业工人向劳动局要求介绍工作，也向劳动部、西北总工会请求介绍工作，发生了紊乱现象。武汉一部分负责登记工作的干部对业务不熟悉，闹不清登记范围，又不敢负责，对登记工作影响很大。有的地区因缺乏调查研究，致救济粮发的不公，也会引起失业工人间的不满。（三）救济的目的在于帮助工人度过暂时困难，保存工人力量，准备投入生产。因此，工作干部必须防止单纯“赈济”观点，同时也应防止过分严格选择救济对象时“工程”观点，必须根据原则，分别轻重缓急，针对不同对象，以不同的方法来解决。
