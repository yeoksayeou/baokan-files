　　Acheson's Unreasonableness
　　*World Knowledge* Editorial

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: *World Knowledge*, Volume 22, Issue 4, published on the 28th, ran an editorial entitled "Acheson's Unreasonableness," stating: After Indian Prime Minister Nehru suggested to the Soviet Union and the United States on July 13th that the Korean problem be resolved peacefully through United Nations bodies, Stalin immediately replied with approval. However, Acheson's response was unreasonable, and he flatly refused.

What kind of solution did Nehru suggest? He suggested eliminating the current deadlock in the United Nations Security Council so that representatives of the People's Republic of China could participate in the Security Council, and the Soviet Union could return to the Security Council, to seek a basis for the final resolution of the Korean problem. Stalin added one point in his reply, that the Security Council should hear the views of the representatives of the Korean people. This pointed out a peaceful path to the resolution of the Korean problem.

Acheson's reply to Nehru on the 18th, however, pointed out a path to war. On the same day, Truman submitted a message to the United States Congress, resolutely pulling the United States onto the path of expanding the war. Truman requested an additional military budget of $10 billion, requested the mobilization of reserve forces, and requested that the United States shift its materials and manpower from peacetime production to war production. Truman's message rejected the world's people's desire for peace and willingly became the enemy of the world's people.

The editorial pointed out: Now the United Nations has become an affiliate of the United States State Department, an institution for registering and executing American orders. Its life is hanging by a thread. The only cure is to have representatives of the People's Republic of China attend the United Nations. Only with the presence of representatives from China and the Soviet Union, that is, by implementing the principle of five-power unanimity, can the Security Council regain its life, and the entire United Nations system can resume its work.

### 艾奇逊蛮不讲理  《世界知识》社论

　　艾奇逊蛮不讲理
    《世界知识》社论
    【新华社二十九日讯】二十八日出版的世界知识第二十二卷第四期，以《艾奇逊蛮不讲理》为题，发表社论称：七月十三日印度总理尼赫鲁，分别向苏联和美国建议通过联合国机构和平解决朝鲜问题之后，斯大林立即复电赞同，但是艾奇逊的答复却是蛮不讲理，悍然拒绝。
    尼赫鲁建议了怎样的解决办法呢？他建议消除目前联合国安全理事会中的僵局，以便使中国人民政府的代表能参加安理会，苏联能回到安理会来，为朝鲜问题的最后解决寻求基础。斯大林在复电中补充了一点意见，即应在安理会上，听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见。这就给朝鲜问题的解决指出了和平的道路。
    艾奇逊十八日给尼赫鲁的答复，却指出了一条战争的道路。同日杜鲁门向美国国会提出咨文，更是坚决地把美国拉到扩大战争的道路上去。杜鲁门要求追加军事预算一百亿元，要求动员后备军队，并且要求把美国的物资和人力从平时生产转向战争生产。杜鲁门的咨文拒绝了全世界人民的和平愿望，自甘成为世界人民的仇敌。
    社论指出：现在联合国已成为美国国务院的附属机构，成为登记和执行美国命令的机构。它的生命已经岌岌可危。唯一的治疗办法，就是使中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国。只有在中国和苏联代表出席的情形下，即执行五强一致协议的原则，安理会才能恢复生命，整个联合国机构也才能恢复工作。
