    Observing Credit in Ordering Goods:
    The Industry Department of Chahar Province Should Inspect the Work of the Datong Purchasing and Marketing Office

To the Editor:

　　The Datong Railway Supply and Marketing Cooperative (supplying the necessities of life for 5,000 employees and their families) ordered 20,000 catties of naked oat flour and 22.5 catties of sesame oil from the Datong Purchasing and Marketing Office of the Industry Department of Chahar Province on June 12th. Because the office did not have the goods in stock (naked oat flour), they told us to pick up the goods at the Datong City private Tongyuan Flour Mill (a business entrusted with processing by the purchasing and marketing office). It was agreed at the time that the goods would be delivered within ten days. However, on the third day after the order was placed (June 15th), Tongyuan Flour Mill was sealed up by the government for speculation and profiteering, and it was impossible to pick up the goods. On the same day, the cooperative sent someone to contact the purchasing and marketing office to inquire about how this matter should be handled. Section Chief Li of the office claimed that they would reply after studying it. By the 19th, since there had been no reply, we sent someone to the office again to negotiate, but Section Chief Li actually said that they would not bear any responsibility at all. That afternoon, Comrade Zhang Shu, the director of the cooperative, and the person who made the purchase at the time went to the office together to discuss the matter with Deputy Director Wang of the office. Deputy Director Wang said: "Whether Tongyuan Flour Mill delivers the flour or not is your responsibility. It has nothing to do with us." And said that our receiving the full payment is equivalent to delivering the goods in full. This is indeed a way of shirking responsibility. On June 20th, Comrade Liu Deshan, the labor union representative, and Comrade Zhang Shu, the director of the cooperative, went to negotiate again, hoping for a quick solution. Section Chief Li said: "You have a lot of workers, why don't you come and smash the enterprise company! Or go to court." As a result, after going there five times, the conclusion was always the same: they had no responsibility at all.

　　Please ask the editor, is the handling of this matter by the purchasing and marketing office reasonable?

Editor's Note: According to the letter, since the Datong Purchasing and Marketing Office of the Industry Department of Chahar Province has received full payment, it should be responsible for delivering the goods in full. Otherwise, it should return the payment to the purchaser. If it is not clear whether Tongyuan Flour Mill had delivered all the goods before it was shut down, an investigation should be conducted; the attitude of completely shirking responsibility is wrong. The Datong Purchasing and Marketing Office should pay attention to two points: one is to maintain business credit, and the other is to have a viewpoint of serving the masses. Economic workers, like all personnel in state organs, will surely ruin their work if they do not observe credit and lack a mass viewpoint. It is hoped that the Industry Department of Chahar Province will inspect the work of the Datong Purchasing and Marketing Office.

### 订货要讲信用  察省工业厅应检查大同购销处工作

　　订货要讲信用
    察省工业厅应检查大同购销处工作编辑同志：
    大同铁路供销合作社（供给五千员工、家属的生活必需品），在六月十二日向察哈尔省工业厅大同购销处订购莜面二万斤、麻油二十二斤半。因该处没有现货（莜面），叫我们到大同市私营同源面庄（购销处委托加工商号）取货。当时商妥在十天内将货交清。但在订购以后的第三天（六月十五日），同源面庄因投机倒把被政府查封，无法取货。当天合作社即派人与购销处联系，询问此事应作如何处理。该处李股长声称等研究后再作答复。到十九日，因尚未见答复，我们又派人去该处接洽，但李股长竟说他们一点责任都不负。当天下午本社的主任张澍同志与当时的购货人又一同去该购销处与该处王副主任商谈。王副主任说：“同源面庄交面不交面，这是你们的责任。与我们无关”。并说我们收清了款，就等于交清了货。这确实是推卸责任的说法。六月二十日工会代表刘德山同志与合作社主任张澍同志又前往商谈，望速解决。李股长说：“你们工人多，来捣企业公司好了！或者上诉去。”结果连去五次都是一句话的结论：他们没有一点责任。
    请问编者同志，该购销处对此事的处理是否合理？
                            大同工会工作组
                          大同铁路职工供销合作社
    编者按：依照来信所说，察省工业厅大同购销处既然收清了货款，便应负责交清货物。否则就应将所收货款退还订购者。如果不了解同源面庄在停业之前是否已经交清货物，则应进行调查；完全推脱不负责任的态度是不对的。大同购销处应该注意两点：一是保持经营信用，一是要有为群众服务的观点。从事经济工作的人员，如同一切国家机关的人员一样，如果不讲信用，缺乏群众观点，就一定会把工作办坏的。希望察省工业厅检查大同购销处的工作。
