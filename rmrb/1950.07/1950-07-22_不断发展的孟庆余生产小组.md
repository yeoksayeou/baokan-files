　　The Constantly Developing Meng Qingyu Production Team
    Qu Changchuan
    Meng Qingyu, a Communist Party member from Yonghe Village, Fourteenth District, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, is a Special-Class Labor Model in Heilongjiang Province. The production team he leads had five households, seven laborers, and three hundred mu of land in 1948, yielding a total of one hundred twenty shi of grain, averaging four dou per mu, and seventeen shi, one dou, and one sheng per laborer. In 1949, the team increased to ten households, eleven laborers, and six hundred sixteen mu of land, yielding a total of four hundred shi and four dou of grain, averaging six dou and five per mu, and thirty-six shi and four per laborer. In 1950, the team has thirteen households, fifteen laborers, and seven hundred eighty-four and a half mu of land, with a planned grain yield of five hundred fifty-eight shi and nine sheng, averaging seven dou and one sheng and one per mu, and thirty-seven shi and two dou per laborer.
    What methods does Meng Qingyu use to gradually consolidate and expand the team, and to produce more grain year after year? First, he can unite the entire team, promote democracy, and genuinely achieve voluntariness and mutual benefit. For example, the horse of team member Li Changfa was very thin during planting season and could not handle a full workload, so he was rated at seven points. By the time of harrowing, the horse had gained some weight, and Li Changfa felt somewhat disadvantaged. Meng Qingyu then led everyone to re-evaluate, resulting in a rating of eight points. Li Changfa happily said, "This is fair and reasonable, how could I not work hard!" Therefore, everyone in their team does not miss work, puts in extra effort, and everyone works especially happily. Their team pays extreme attention to applying fertilizer and selecting seeds. They didn't select many seeds the year before; last year, most of the seeds were selected, so the crops had exceptionally large ears; this year, they are doing a fine selection and disinfecting them.
    In North Manchuria, the old habit of farmers is "From the Beginning of Summer to Grain Full, it’s not too late to plant anything"; therefore, planting is always done without haste. However, according to Meng Qingyu's experience: in certain solar terms, "Planting one day early means harvesting ten days early." This year, he started planting wheat on March 19th, seven days earlier than others. By the time others were planting wheat, his wheat had already sprouted. When planting soybeans in their village this year, influenced by him, they planted six or seven days earlier than other villages. On May 21st, there was a frost, and the late-planted soybeans were badly damaged, but Meng Qingyu's team's soybeans were only slightly affected and recovered in two days. Now the wheat is in the process of grain filling and developing jaundice; Meng Qingyu's team's wheat, because it was planted early, has already filled its grain and is not afraid.
    Meng Qingyu also pays special attention to mastering new technologies. He often thinks, "If we want to do well in agriculture, we can't rely on the old ways." This year, his team used two cultivator-harrow machines. At first, no one knew how to use them, and some lost confidence, saying, "This thing, a hook on one side and a curve on the other, how can it work well?" Meng Qingyu said, "It's because we don't know how to use it, not that it doesn't work well." So he personally learned how to use it. After a few days, he finally mastered the technology, not only could use it, but was very skilled, saving two man-days per ten mu. Old Meng thought, "With this thing, five cultivations and five harrowings can be guaranteed, strive to complete six cultivations and six harrowings!" On June 1st, Old Meng attended the county People's Representative Conference and put forward his cultivation-harrowing plan at the meeting. Some representatives didn't believe it, some representatives (labor models) wanted to compete with Old Meng. After discussion, many representatives made plans for five cultivations and five harrowings. After the meeting, the Northeast People's Government sent Old Meng's team another combined cultivator-harrow machine. When they used it, it worked even better than the original one. The whole team jumped up with joy, men and women, old and young, all went to the field, ten men cultivated, two harrowed, and another three drove three cultivator-harrow machines. The whole team, except for two women with young children who stayed at home to cook, all eleven others went to the field to weed. Four primary school students who were on vacation also participated in cultivating the land. People, horses, cultivator-harrow machines, a dense black mass, other teams envied and said, "Next year we will also use cultivator-harrow machines!" Meng Qingyu's mother is sixty-seven years old this year and couldn't stop smiling. When she was delivering water and food to the fields, she kept chanting, "Communist Party, Chairman Mao, because of you, we have today!"
    When other labor models are working hard to complete five cultivations and five harrowings, Meng Qingyu wrote to the provincial chairman on June 26th, reporting that his team, except for soybeans, will soon complete seven cultivations and seven harrowings for other crops.

　　不断发展的孟庆余生产小组
    曲常川
    黑龙江省海伦县十四区永合村中共党员孟庆余，是黑龙江省特等劳动模范。他领导的生产小组，在一九四八年是五户，七个劳动力，三百亩地，共打一百二十石粮，平均每亩打四斗，每个劳动力合十七石一斗一升。一九四九年，小组增至十户，十一个劳动力，六百一十六亩地，共打四百石零四斗粮，平均每亩打六斗五，每个劳动力合三十六石四。一九五○年，小组十三户，十五个劳动力，七百八十四亩半地，计划打粮五百五十八石零九升，平均每亩打七斗一升一，每个劳动力合三十七石二斗。
    孟庆余用什么办法，使小组逐渐巩固扩大，一年比一年多打粮食呢？首先他能团结全组，发扬民主，真正作到自愿两利。如组员李长发的马，种地时很瘦，顶不上一个整工，被评了七分。到趟地时，马胖了些，李长发觉得有点吃亏。孟庆余便领导大家给重评分，结果评了八分。李长发高兴地说：“这样公平合理，那能不下劲干呢！”所以他们组里人人不旷工，多出活，大家干得特别高兴。他们组在上粪及选种方面，极为注意。他们前年选种不多；去年大部分种是选过的，所以庄稼穗格外肥大；今年则做到精选，且经过消毒。
    在北满，农民的老习惯是“立夏到小满，种啥也不晚”；因此，种地总是不着忙。但是，根据孟庆余的经验：在一定的节气里“早种一天，早收十天。”今年他在三月十九号就开始种麦，比别人早种七天。等别人种麦时，他的麦已露头了。今年他们村里种大豆时，在他的影响下，比别村早种六、七天。五月二十一号下了场寒霜，晚种的豆子冻坏不少，孟庆余组的豆子冻了一下，两天就苏醒过来了。现在麦子正灌浆，起了黄疸病；孟庆余组的麦子，因为种得早，浆已灌满，不怕了。
    孟庆余对新技术的掌握也特别注意。他常想：“要想把农业搞好，光靠老一套是不行的。”今年他组用了两台铲趟机。开始大家不会使，有人便没信心，说：“这玩意儿，这边一个钩钩，那边一个弯弯，那能好使？”孟庆余说：“这是我们不会使，不是不好使。”于是他便亲自学着使。过了几天，终于掌握了技术，不但会使，且很熟练，十亩地能省两个人工。老孟寻思着：“有了这家伙，五铲五趟能保准，争取完成六铲六趟！”六月一号，老孟出席县人民代表会议，在会上提出了他的铲趟计划。有的代表不相信，有的代表（劳动模范）要与老孟比高低。经过讨论，很多代表作了五铲五趟计划。开完会以后，东北人民政府又给老孟组送来一台联合铲趟机。他们一用，比原先一台更好使。全组乐的跳起来了，男女老少齐下地，十个男人铲，两个趟，另三个驾驶三台铲趟机。全组除了两个有小孩的妇女在家作饭外，其余十一人全下地薅苗拔草。四个放假回来的小学生，也参加了铲地。人、马、铲趟机，黑压压的一大片，别组眼热地说：“明年咱也使铲趟机！”孟庆余的母亲今年六十七岁了，乐的闭不住嘴。她在往地里送水送饭时，嘴里不住地念颂着：“共产党，毛主席，有了您，才有今天！”
    别的劳动模范，正在努力完成五铲五趟的时候，孟庆余却于六月二十六号给省主席去信，报告他组除豆子外，其他庄稼快要完成七铲七趟了。
