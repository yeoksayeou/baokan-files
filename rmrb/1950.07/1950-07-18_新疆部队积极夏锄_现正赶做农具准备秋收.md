Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 16th: Since the beginning of June, the troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army participating in agricultural production have been carrying out weeding. Now they are actively rushing to manufacture various farm tools and build warehouses in preparation for the autumn harvest. According to reports from various units, of the 800,000 mu of various crops, except for 40,000 mu of alkali-sensitive crops (Xinjiang soil is mostly alkaline), such as cotton, which have died, the rest have been weeded once or twice. Currently, sorghum, rice, and cotton have emerged from the soil by one chi (Chinese foot, approx. 1/3 meter), corn has grown to over three chi high, and spring wheat has formed grains and ears, and will be ready for harvesting in late July. North and south of the Tianshan Mountains, a scene of lush green has completely changed the original desolate landscape.

The troops' weeding work has significant implications for this year's crops. Because the cultivated land is all barren land that has not been planted for many years, weeds grow luxuriantly after cultivation, and in some places, the seedlings are covered. At the beginning of June, various departments successively issued instructions to "deeply plow and finely cultivate, weed and remove grass." The soldiers resolutely fought against weeds under the slogans of "Weeding one more time, the seedlings grow well" and "Uproot the weeds." Each company and unit launched a warm weeding competition. When there were no tools, the commanders and fighters used their hands to pull. The Uighur farmers said, "This time, by pulling the grass, ten jin of seeds can yield sixty to seventy jin." According to preliminary minimum estimates, if there are no other disasters, each mu of spring wheat can yield 160 "old jin" (local "old jin" is equivalent to 1.7 "city jin"), rice can yield 250 "old jin", and cotton and beans can yield 128 "old jin". Now, the commanders and fighters of various units are rushing to make various farm tools such as brooms, wooden rakes, push boards, and forks, building warehouses, and actively preparing for the autumn harvest a month later.

　　新疆部队积极夏锄
    现正赶做农具准备秋收
    【新华社迪化十六日电】人民解放军新疆军区参加农业生产的部队自六月初开始即进行夏锄，现在已在积极地赶造各种农具，修建仓库，准备秋收。据各部队汇报，在八十万亩的各种作物中，除有四万亩怕碱作物（新疆土质多碱）如棉花等死去外，其余均已分别锄草一遍或两遍。现高粱、稻子、棉花已出土一尺，包谷已长到三尺多高，春麦已结子吐穗，七月下旬即可开镰收割。天山南北，一片葱绿，完全改变了原来的荒凉景况。
    部队的夏锄工作对今年的农作物有着重大的意义。由于耕地都是多年不种的荒地，耕作后野草丛生，有的地方把庄稼苗都掩盖了。六月初各部先后发出“深耕细作，锄地拔草”的指示，战士们便在“多锄一次草，禾苗长得好”和“斩草除根”的口号下，坚决向野草作斗争。各连队、各单位均展开了热烈的锄草竞赛。没有工具，指战员们就用双手拔。维族农民说：“这回一拔草，十斤种籽可以收到六七十斤。”据初步最低估计：如没有其它灾害发生，春麦每亩可收一百六十老斤（当地每老斤合一点七市斤），稻子可收二百五十老斤，棉花，豆类可收一百二十八老斤。现在各部指战员正赶做扫帚、木铣、推板、叉子等各种农具，修建仓库，积极准备一个月以后的秋收。
