Chongqing Industry is Rebuilding
    Jiang Heng

    Chongqing's industry, once one of China's heavy industrial bases, has moved from stagnation to reconstruction in the half-year since liberation, under the leadership and support of the People's Government and the Southwest Industrial Department.

    As I traveled from Chongqing along the Jialing River to Xiaolongkan, from Beibei along the Jialing River to Chongqing, and from Chongqing along the Yangtze River to Dadukou, I saw countless public and private factories standing neatly on both sides of the great river. I also saw the workers of Factory 29, Yu Feng Textile Factory, the private Da Ming Textile Factory, Tianfu Coal Mine, and others actively maintaining production and carrying out reconstruction on the ruins destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They threw out bales of finished yarn and cloth one after another, carried the mined coal load by load onto river steamers and wooden boats, and cast and rolled steel rails one by one, piling them into steel mountains, so that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of the Southwest had longed to build for forty years, was finally realized today.

    During the years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Southwest, especially Chongqing, once became the center of national industry. The number of factories, workers, and power equipment accounted for almost half of the national total during the war. According to statistics, the number of factories in Chongqing in 1936 accounted for only one-third of the 115 factories in the entire province. By 1945, there were 1,158 factories in various industries (there were 5,995 in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang, with Chongqing accounting for slightly less than one-fifth). Among them, the machinery industry accounted for more than one-third. In terms of production capacity, there were 1,980 power machines with 17,370 horsepower, 6,355 machine tools, and four steelmaking furnaces, ironmaking furnaces, and rolling mills each. There were also 150,596 spinning spindles. In the past, Chongqing could manufacture its own rolling steel, spindles, auto parts, auto engines, steam cylinders for steamships, locomotives, power motors, and so on, which could not be made in the country.

    However, these industries, built on the basis of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's anti-people military, with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, were flooded with American goods, soaring prices, excessive costs, and the monopoly and exploitation of bureaucratic capital, so that the "prosperous" Chongqing national industry fell into a state of stagnation and closure. Before liberation, it was further damaged by the bandit gang, and its vitality was even more damaged. However, this tragic scene has begun to change the state of stagnation caused by destruction and is gradually being rebuilt in the half-year since the People's Government invested (more than 45.3 billion yuan) and placed orders.

    Let's start with heavy industry! As for the power industry, which is the prime mover of industry, before liberation, Chongqing's public and private utilities had 11,000 horsepower, seven public self-use power plants had 19,762 horsepower, and five private self-use power plants had 5,807 horsepower. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang retreated, they wantonly destroyed them. Machines with a total of 20,850 horsepower from only seven power plants, including Factory 29, Changshou Power Plant, and Chongqing Power Company (joint public-private), were either completely or partially destroyed. Nearly 6,500 horsepower has now been repaired; 20,400 horsepower is being installed and waiting to be installed, which will soon exceed the original number before liberation. After the unified allocation was implemented in May, the city's years of power outages in separate zones have been changed. At the same time, electricity bills have also been reduced by 5%, creating favorable conditions for reducing industrial costs.

    In terms of the iron and steel machinery industry, there were originally 433 companies during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, 49 companies moved, 141 companies stopped work, and the remaining 182 companies were in a state of semi-production. The total number of employees also decreased from 65,000 to 31,000. For example, Yu Xin Steel Plant, the largest private factory, only cast pots and iron nails for cooking and boiling salt. Shunchang Iron Factory also mortgaged most of its machine tools to the pseudo-Production Bureau. By the eve of liberation, only 165 companies were left, and only 27 were operating or partially operating. As for the machines of public factories, as many as 865 were destroyed by the bandit gang in only eight factories, including Factory 50. Therefore, in the early days of liberation, both public and private steel factories were in a state of stagnation. After May of this year, due to the need for supplies for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and orders for steel bridges, more than half of the public and private iron and steel machinery factories have fully or partially resumed work. For example, there are a total of ten private steel plants, with six operating, one half-operating, and three shut down. Now the private Yu Xin Steel Plant and other factories have completed part of the iron bridges, steel rails, and large and small steel parts.

    As for the coal industry, which serves as fuel for industry and transportation, it is also resuming mining. During the Anti-Japanese War, there were as many as 101 coal mines in the Jialing River area, and the highest monthly sales volume of coal reached more than 90,000 tons. The four public coal mines, including Heping and Huaan (with a total of 254 staff members and 3,964 workers), produced a maximum of more than 19,100 tons of coal and 4,000 tons of coke per month, accounting for 22% of the total output in the Southwest. The larger private coal mines, such as Tianfu and Baoyuan (with a total of 850 staff members and 13,497 workers), produced a maximum of 78,800 tons of coal and 1,350 tons of coke per month, accounting for 78% of the total output in the Southwest. Among them, Tianfu Coal Mine had the largest output, accounting for about more than one-half. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, most of the factories were closed or relocated, the demand for coal shrank, and the coal mines also fell into a state of stagnation, selling only about 40,000 tons per month. After liberation, as industrial transportation is being restored, coal sales are not strong. After the government successively loaned more than 3.1 billion yuan and ordered more than 85,000 tons of coal (private enterprises accounting for 87.4%), 60 to 70 public and private coal mines have started production, with an average monthly output of 65,000 tons. In addition to market needs, there is a surplus of 10,000 tons. In the future, when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is opened to traffic and industrial transportation is fully restored, Chongqing's coal industry will have broad prospects for development. The basic issues in the future lie in abolishing the headman system, improving safety equipment, and promoting the enthusiasm of workers to improve quality and reduce costs.

    In terms of the light industry, the machine cotton textile industry, during the Anti-Japanese War, the Chongqing area had 150,596 large spinning spindles, 7,896 small spinning machines, 82 woolen machines, 196 weaving machines, and 1,510 sewing machines. By the eve of liberation, in addition to those destroyed by the Chiang bandits, only more than 120,000 spindles were left, and most of them had been shut down. After liberation, with the government's supply of raw cotton, processing, and ordering, 16 cotton textile factories were fully operational, with approximately 90% of the spindles operating; eight silk textile and wool textile factories only half operated due to sales problems. After the implementation of land reform, the 70 million people in Sichuan needed 10 million bolts of cloth. According to the current productivity, it is still far from enough, so the future of the cotton textile industry is infinitely bright. Now, public and private yarn factories are working hard to improve business management and reduce costs. Nine yarn factories have reduced the raw cotton required for each yarn from 456 jin to approximately 425 jin. If the waste of packaging, water, electricity, and redundant personnel can be further reduced, the cost of each yarn can be reduced by approximately two more real units. For example, Shenxin has 1,248 employees, and there are 190 service personnel, including 70 in the kitchen. As for the phenomenon of collecting dry wages without working, which increases costs, is even more serious. Most of the 31 employees in the business department of the factory have nothing to do, but they receive very high salaries. Another example is that the monthly travel expenses of the five executive directors of Yuhua Textile Factory exceed one-third of the total salaries of the factory's employees. If it is not reformed, it will inevitably be difficult to maintain.

    The towel, knitwear, and homespun industries in the light industry also developed after the Anti-Japanese War. Among them, the homespun industry increased from 576 factories to 2,026 factories, the knitwear industry increased from 3,000 machines to 16,000 machines, and the monthly output increased from 58,000 bolts to 322,000 bolts. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, under the dumping of American goods, all three industries fell into a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. After liberation, with the support of government orders, most have been restored. Of the 1,540 homespun factories with 4,208 looms, more than half have started work. Of the 185 towel factories, 155 have started work, with a total of 1,700 employees and 748 woolen machines and 78 blanket machines, producing 40,000 dozen towels per month. Workers are already feeling insufficient (monthly production of 8,000 blankets has been suspended due to lack of sales). There are 180 knitting factories with 877 employees and 1,100 machines, each machine producing two dozen per day. They started work one after another after April, and most are now operating and maintaining production.

    In terms of the chemical industry, all six rubber industries and seven leather industries have fully resumed work due to strong sales and high output. Ten of the fifteen alcohol industries have resumed work. Other industries such as matches, paper making, and soap, however, are overproducing. Although many have started work, and even some have been newly established, they are mostly producing blindly and still need to be reorganized.

    In terms of the food industry, although the rice milling, flour, and other industries have started work with the support of government processing and orders, most are also overproducing and sales are not strong. For example, there are more than 200 rice mills in Chongqing with 272 machines, producing 800,000 shi per month, but only 180,000 shi are actually needed. In addition, there are 41 cigarette industries with 98 large and small machines, producing 7,000 boxes per month, but only more than 2,000 boxes can be sold. Therefore, at present, only 12 are operating or partially operating.

    At present, Chongqing's industry is in the process of social and economic reorganization. The most significant features are three: (1) All industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are moving towards recovery or reconstruction, while those that are not are moving towards shutdown or closure; (2) Those who can change their business policies, improve their business methods, and improve quality and specifications can become self-reliant, maintain production, and even be profitable. Otherwise, it will be more difficult to maintain production; (3) Regardless of public or private small factories, due to simple equipment, independent operation increases costs, so they must be adjusted, or converted to other industries, or jointly operated, in order to contribute to the comprehensive recovery of industry and the implementation of a planned economy.

    Chongqing is an important hub of water and land transportation in the Southwest, the center of industry and commerce, and the Southwest is rich in natural resources. Building an industrial Chongqing and building an industrialized Southwest are fully equipped with superior conditions. As long as we implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, and overcome the difficulties in the reorganization period, we can move towards normal development and have a bright and promising future.

　　重庆工业在重建中
    江横
    曾为中国重工业基地之一的重庆工业，解放后半年来，在人民政府及西南工业部的领导与扶植下，已由停顿走向重建。
    当我从重庆沿着嘉陵江到小龙坎，从北碚沿着嘉陵江到重庆，从重庆再沿着长江到大渡口，看到无数的公私营工厂，齐齐整整的矗立在大江两岸，也看到二十九厂、豫丰纱厂以及私营大明纱厂，天府煤矿等的职工们，在蒋介石匪帮破坏的废墟上，积极的维持生产，进行重建。他们把制成的纱布一包一包的甩出来，把挖出的煤一挑一挑的装到江轮和木船上，把一根一根的钢轨铸出来、轧出来，堆成钢山，使四十年来西南人民渴望建筑的成渝铁路，终于在今天实现了。
    抗日战争的数年间，西南，特别是重庆，曾一度成为民族工业的中心。工厂数目，工人人数及动力设备等等，几皆占战时全国总数的一半。据统计，重庆的工厂数，在一九三六年，仅占全省一百十五家的三分之一，到一九四五年各业工厂即达一千一百五十八家（滇、黔、川、康共有五千九百九十五家，而重庆则占五分之一弱），其中主要是机器业占三分之一强。就生产能力看，计有动力机一千九百八十部，一万七千三百七十马力，工具机六千三百五十五部，炼钢炉、炼铁炉、轧钢机各四座，大型纺纱机十五万零五千九百六十锭。过去本国不能做的轧钢、纱锭、汽车零件、汽车引擎、火轮汽缸、火车头、动力马达等等，重庆都能够自造。
    但是，这些建立在蒋介石匪帮反人民的军事基础上的工业，随着抗战的胜利，在美货充斥，物价暴涨，成本过高，以及官僚资本的垄断和压榨下，使“繁荣”一时的重庆民族工业便陷于停顿和倒闭的状态。解放前又经匪帮的破坏，元气更为亏损了。然而这种惨景，半年来经人民政府的投资（四百五十三亿多元）、订货等等扶植，已经开始改变了因破坏而停顿的状态，逐步在重建着。
    先以重工业来说吧！作为工业原动力的电业，解放前重庆公私营公用电有一万一千马力，七个公营自用电厂有一万九千七百六十二马力，五个私营自用电厂有五千八百零七马力，在蒋介石匪帮败退时，大肆破坏，仅二十九厂、长寿电厂、重庆电力公司（公私合营）等七个电厂二万零八百五十马力的机器全部或一部被炸毁了。现经修复的，已有近六千五百马力；正安装和待安装的有二万零四百马力，不久的将来即可超过解放前的原数。五月间实行了统一调配后，已改变了重庆市多年来的分区停电状况。同时，电费也已减少了百分之五，为减低工业成本创造了有利的条件。
    在钢铁机械业方面，抗战时原有四百三十三家，抗战胜利后，除四十九家迁移外，有一百四十一家停工，其余一百八十二家，则陷于半生产状态。职工总人数也由六万五千人减少到三万一千人。如私营工厂中最大的渝鑫钢厂，仅铸制烧饭熬盐之锅与铁钉，顺昌铁工厂把工作母机也多抵押于伪生产局，到解放前夕，仅剩下一百六十五家，而开工或部分开工者仅二十七家。至于公营工厂的机器，仅第五十厂等八家，被匪帮破坏者即达八百六十五部。因之解放初期，无论公私钢铁工厂都陷于停顿状态。到今年五月以后，因接受修筑成渝铁路之工需品和钢桥等订货，公私营钢铁机械厂便有半数以上全部复工或部分复工了。如私营钢铁厂共有十家，开工者六家，半开工者一家。停工者三家。现私营渝鑫钢铁厂等二十九厂已完成一部分铁桥、钢轨和大小钢件。
    至于作为工业与交通燃料的煤业亦在恢复开采。嘉陵江区煤矿，在抗战中曾多至一百零一家，煤矿产销量最高额每月曾达九万余吨。计和平、华安等四家公营煤矿（共有职员二百五十四人，工人三千九百六十四人），每月最高产煤一万九千一百余吨，焦炭四千吨，占西南总产量百分之二十二；私营煤矿较大者有天府、宝源等十家（共有职员八五○人，工人一万三千四百九十七人），每月最高产量七万八千八百吨，焦炭一千三百五十吨，占西南总产量百分之七十八，其中以天府煤矿产量最大，约占二分之一强。但到抗战胜利后，工厂大多停闭或迁移，需煤量萎缩，煤矿亦陷于停顿状态，每月只销四万吨左右。解放后，因工业交通正在恢复，煤炭销路不旺，经政府先后贷款三十一亿余元，订购煤斤八万五千余吨（私营占百分之八七点四）后，已有六七十家公私营煤矿开工生产，平均月产量六万五千吨。除市场需要外尚过剩一万吨。将来成渝铁路通车，工业交通全部恢复后，重庆的煤业当有广泛发展的前途。今后的基本问题，在于废除把头制度，改进安全设备，发扬工人的积极性，以提高质量和减低成本。
    轻工业方面的机器棉纺织业，在抗战时，重庆地区有大型纺纱机十五万零五千九百六十锭，小型纺织机七千八百九十六锭，毛织机八十二锭，织布机一百九十六部，缝纫机一千五百零十部，到解放前夕，除被蒋匪破坏者外，仅有纱锭十二万余枚，也已大部停顿。解放后，经过政府供给原棉、加工、订购，十六家棉纺厂完全开工，约有百分之九十左右的纺锭开动生产；八家丝纺织、毛纺织厂，因销路问题只有一半开工。实行土地改革后，四川七千万人口即需一千万匹布，依照目前的生产力，还相差太远，因而棉纺织业的前途是无限光明的。现各公私纱厂，正为改善经营管理和减低成本而努力，有九个纱厂已将每件纱需要原棉四百五六十斤，减少为四百二十五斤左右，如再能减少包装水电和冗员的浪费，则每件纱的成本还可减去二个左右的折实单位。如申新有职工一千二百四十八人，勤杂人员即有一百九十人，其中厨房即有七十人，至于领干薪不做工增加成本的现象更为严重，该厂营业课的三十一位职员大部无事可做，工薪却拿的很高。又如裕华纺织厂五名常务理事，每月的车马费即超过全厂职员工薪的三分之一。如不加以改革，势必难以维持。
    轻工业中的毛巾、针织、土布等工业，也是在抗战后才发展起来的。其中土布业即由五七六家厂增为二、○二六家，针织业由三千台增为一万六千台，每月产量由五万八千匹增至三十二万二千匹。但在抗战胜利后，在美货倾销下，三业均陷于停工或半停工状态。解放后，在政府订货扶植下，已大半恢复，土布业一五四○家，织机四、二○八台，开工者已有二分之一强，毛巾业一八五家，开工者一五五家，共有职工一、七○○人，毛织机七四八部，毯子机七八部，月产毛巾四万打，工人已感不足，（被毯月产八千床，则因无销路停工）。针织业一八○家，职工八七七人，机器一千一百部，每台机日产二打，四月后陆续开工，现已大半开工维持。
    化工业方面的六家橡胶业，七家制革业，因销旺产多全部复工。十五家酒精业有十家复工。其他如火柴、造纸、肥皂等业，则因生产过剩，虽已有不少开工，甚至有新增设的，但多是盲目生产，尚须组织转业。
    食品业方面的碾米、面粉等业，虽在政府加工，订货扶植下，有一部分开工，大部分亦是生产过剩而销路不旺。如重庆米厂有二百多家，二百七十二部机子，月产八十万石，但实际只需十八万石。此外，纸烟业四十一家，大小机器九十八部，月产七千箱，实际二千多箱还卖不了。所以，目前开工或半开工者只有十二家。
    目前重庆的工业，正在处于社会经济改组的过程中，最显著的特征有三：（一）凡有利于国计民生的工业，都在走向恢复或重建，反之，则走向停工或歇业；（二）凡能改变经营方针，改善经营方法，提高品质规格的，就能自力更生，维持生产，甚至有利可图，反之，则维持亦较困难；（三）无论公私营小型工厂，因设备简陋，单独经营更加重成本，所以必须调整，或转业、或联营，才能有助于工业的全面恢复和计划经济的实行。
    重庆为西南水陆交通要地，工商业的中心，加以西南天然资源丰富，建设工业重庆，建设工业化的西南，完全具备着优越的条件。只要贯彻公私兼顾，劳资两利的政策，度过改组时期中的困难，就能走向正常发展，而有着光明远大的前程。
