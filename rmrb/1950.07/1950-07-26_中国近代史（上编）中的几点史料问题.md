Several Historical Material Problems in Modern Chinese History (Upper Volume)
　　Yan Dan

Mr. Fan Wenlan's "Modern Chinese History" (Upper Volume) is quite successful in mastering the viewpoint of historical materialism and selecting historical materials. It is a relatively good work on modern Chinese history. However, after reading it, I feel that there are still some places that need to be discussed, so I am putting them forward for research.

　　(1) The two "Elliots" of Britain in the Opium War were not clearly explained. The former was the Consul in Macau, and the latter was the Commander of the Army. The book used "George Elliot" for the latter, so for the sake of distinction, it should be consistent throughout, and should not sometimes use George Elliot and sometimes simply Elliot, making it confusing for readers.

　　(2) After China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government first sent Detring, the Customs Officer of Tianjin Customs, to Japan with a letter from Li Hongzhang to seek peace, but Japan refused to talk. The book says: "Because he was a British Westerner, not an American Westerner." (Page 332). According to Detring, he was German, not British. Luo Dunrong's "The Whole Story of the Sino-Japanese War" and Yao Xiguang's "Oriental War Chronicle," which Luo Wen based on, are probably the sources of this error. Lu Shude kept a "Relief Diary" after the Allied Forces captured Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion. He recorded the situation of asking Detring for assistance in Tianjin. On the entry for the eighth day of the ninth month, he wrote: "I went to Zhang's residence (Zhang Yanmou, a Beijing official) to see Detring and talked about the current situation. I told him that I had long heard that the soldiers of various countries were very disciplined and I admired them very much. Now that I see that the situation of the soldiers of various countries is the same as that in China, I know that this defeat is not the fault of the war. Detring said: Now that the German soldiers are so unreasonable, I am also ashamed, but my country also regards me as a German barbarian." The time difference is only six years, and there should not be a second famous Detring in Tianjin. I believe that it is correct that the book refers to him as "German."

　　(3) After Li Hongzhang decided to fight Japan, he temporarily sent 2,000 soldiers across the sea to assist the isolated army in Asan. The book says: "He always had to bring some foreign relations before he dared to act, so he hired British merchant ships, such as the Kowshing, at a high price to transport the troops, and Chinese warships, such as the Jiyuan, escorted them." (Page 309) According to the relevant literature on the Sino-Japanese War, only one British ship, the Kowshing (carrying more than 900 soldiers), was chartered at that time, not "three ships." The Roujiang transport ship accompanied the Kowshing. In addition, the Chinese Airen and Feijing ships carrying reinforcements were sent to Asan two days earlier, escorted by three warships, including the Jiyuan, and completed the task. (See Chi Zhonghu: Records of the Sino-Japanese War)

　　(4) After the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, Li Hongzhang returned to Tianjin and claimed illness, refusing to go out. He "sent Cotesworth to the Prime Minister's Yamen to describe 'Li Xiang's loyalty' and urged him to approve the treaty as soon as possible. The treaty was of course approved, and Li Hongzhang gave Cotesworth a reward of 150,000 taels." (Page 336) According to the records, Wu Tingfang was sent to Beijing with the treaty at that time. Cotesworth was hired by the Qing government, and the reward of 150,000 taels would not have been paid out of Li Hongzhang's own pocket, but the original text is very easy to cause misunderstanding.

　　(5) In the chapter on the Boxer Movement, the Guangxu Emperor's objections in several meetings are not mentioned at all. Regarding the fate of the most courageous opponents, Yuan Chang and Xu Jingcheng, it is said: "Under the pressure of the Boxers, Yuan and Xu were beheaded." (Page 447) This is also not in accordance with the facts. In fact, it was because the two of them had changed the "kill" character in the Empress Dowager Cixi's edict to the provinces, which required all foreigners to be killed, to "protect," which was revealed and aroused Cixi's anger, who immediately ordered them to be killed. (But to save face, this was not announced at the time). This is clearly recorded in Jing Shan's diary.

　　(6) In the book's discussion of the three factions on the opium issue, it is correct to consider the resistance faction, such as Lin Zexu, as progressive figures at the time; however, in the Boxer Movement, all factions within the ruling class camp, whether they agreed or opposed, are considered unacceptable, and they are not given a due historical evaluation, adopting an attitude of negating everything, which seems to violate the viewpoint of historical materialism?

　　(7) There must be factions within the ruling class camp, but the leader of the ruling class (the emperor) changes with his own interests and does not belong to any one faction permanently. The book's narrative of the Daoguang Emperor adopting a factional viewpoint is inevitably contradictory. For example, Daoguang (Minning), who supported Lin Zexu's opium prohibition, should be the resistance faction according to the author's intention, but on page 21 of the book, because he did not approve the memorial of the governor of Shanxi regarding allowing soldiers and civilians to report officials who smoked opium, it says: "This is the second blow of the surrender faction against the resistance faction, and they have achieved victory." So Daoguang became a "surrender faction" again; but on page 25, because Daoguang encouraged Lin Zexu and Deng Tingzhen not to believe rumors and to focus on opium prohibition, the book says: "At that time, Minning's main tendency was still on the side of opium prohibition." These self-contradictory and untenable points can be completely avoided if the factions are not forcibly imposed on Minning.

　　(8) The book refers to the Qing emperors by their personal names instead of their temple names, such as calling Daoguang "Minning" instead of Daoguang, and calling Guangxu "Zaitian" instead of Guangxu, etc. Although this is innovative and has revolutionary significance, if the reign titles and temple names are said to be feudal, at least their feudal nature is not very serious; names like Daoguang and Guangxu are already well-known to women and children, but now they are abandoned and the general public has to remember their unfamiliar personal names. I personally think this is not very necessary!

Are the above simple opinions completely correct? I dare not be self-righteous, so I put them forward for discussion. I would also like to add that I am not a historian. Due to work needs, I have only read the parts about the Opium War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Boxer Movement, so this article is not my complete opinion on the book.

Reply

After receiving Mr. Yan Dan's manuscript, we forwarded it to the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Comrade Rong Mengyuan of the institute replied as follows. The reply has been approved by Comrade Fan Wenlan. - Editor

(1) In the Opium War, the two Elliots were Charles Elliot, referred to in the book as "Elliot," and George Elliot, who is referred to by his full name in the book. There was no confusion.

(2) Detring, according to the "Oriental War Chronicle," was said to be British. The book's statement that he was British may be wrong. Judging from his foreign name, he also seems to be German.

(3) The statement that there were three British ships, including the Kowshing, is based on Wang Yunsheng's "Sixty Years of China and Japan," which may be wrong. According to the "Oriental War Chronicle," the "Kowshing" was a British ship; there is no explicit record of the other two ships, the Feijing and the Airen. According to the meaning of the context, they should be two Chinese ships.

(4) The 150,000 taels given to Cotesworth were given by the Qing government. The wording in the book is easy to cause misunderstanding, and will be corrected in the next edition.

(5) The death of Yuan Chang and Xu Jingcheng does have the saying of unauthorized alteration of the edict, but it is doubtful whether Xu Yuan, who was working in the Prime Minister's Office for Foreign Affairs, could have altered the edict. Even if they did alter the edict, it was only one of their anti-Boxer actions. According to the "Records of the Boxer Disaster," the reasons for Xu Yuan's killing were: ① They opposed the use of the Boxers at the imperial court meetings on May 20th and 21st; ② Li Bingheng captured spies on his way north and found letters from Xu to a certain military commissioner in the south and from Yuan to a certain director, in which they revealed the situation in Beijing in detail; ③ Xu Yuan submitted a memorial requesting the suppression of the Boxers and the protection of the embassies; ④ They unauthorizedly altered the telegraphic edict. In total, there were four reasons, all because they were against the Boxers. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say that they died for being against the Boxers than for unauthorizedly altering the edict.

(6) In the Boxer Movement, there were factions in the Qing government that supported and opposed it. They had one thing in common, which was selling out the country to foreigners and oppressing the people internally. The difference was that one faction would use the Boxers when they could not suppress them, and wanted to eliminate the Boxers in the process of using them; one faction always suppressed the Boxers; one faction openly sold out the country at a certain time; and one faction always sold out the country. There is really no way to say which faction was "acceptable." This is different from the distinction between the surrender and resistance factions in the Opium War, which had the distinction between backwardness and progress, and is also different from the fact that Kang Youwei had a certain degree of progressiveness during the Hundred Days' Reform.

(7) Although the emperor in the Opium War could temporarily approach one faction or another for his own benefit, he was by no means aloof. For example, although Minning once supported Lin Zexu's opium prohibition, he was planning for his own benefit and was different from Lin Zexu and others, so when serious opium prohibition was detrimental to him, he opposed opium prohibition. The book's statement that Minning wavered is not contradictory.

(8) We believe that it is right to call the emperor by his personal name. Because the feudal temple names and posthumous titles are not necessary to use again, and they are also unfamiliar to everyone. For example, Minning's temple name is "Xuanzong" and his posthumous title is "Xiaotian... (20 characters deleted) Emperor Cheng," and Zaitian's temple name is "Dezong" and his posthumous title is "Tongtian... (18 characters deleted) Emperor Jing," which are unfamiliar to most people. Since the temple names, posthumous titles, and personal names are all unfamiliar, it is better to use the personal name. Furthermore, the titles "Emperor Daoguang" and "Emperor Guangxu" commonly used by people are unscientific and should not be promoted. Because "Daoguang" and "Guangxu" are both reign titles, it is wrong to use them as personal names, and if one person changes the reign title twice or more, it will be difficult to call them. For example, the reign title of Huang Taiji was initially "Tiancong" and later changed to "Chongde." Should he be called "Emperor Chongde" or "Emperor Tiancong"? There are more troubles in other dynasties. Therefore, we advocate that the emperor should be called by his personal name.

### 中国近代史（上编）中的几点史料问题

　　中国近代史（上编）中的几点史料问题
    燕丹
    范文澜先生著《中国近代史》（上编）在掌握唯物史观的观点，选择史料等方面，都是相当成功的。它是一部比较优良的中国近代史著作。但笔者读后，觉得还有些地方需要商榷，特提出来研究一下。
    （一）鸦片战争中英国的两个“义律”，没有明白的交代清楚，前一个是澳门领事，后一个是陆军统帅，本书对后者既用过“乔治义律”，则为分别起见，就应始终一致，不应有时用乔治义律，有时又简称义律，使读者搞不清楚。
    （二）甲午之战中国失败后，满清政府第一次派天津海关税务司德璀琳携李鸿章函赴日求和，日本不允接谈。本书说：“因为他是英国西人，不是美国西人”。（三三二页）。按德璀琳是德国人，不是英国人。罗惇曧的“中日兵事本末”，及罗文所根据的姚锡光的“东方兵事纪略”，大概是此处错误的来源。陆树德在庚子事变，联军陷京后，有“救济日记”，他记在天津请德璀琳协助救济情形，九月初八日下有云：“到张宅（张燕谋京卿）见德璀璘，畅谈时事，予告以久闻各国兵丁甚有纪律，极为钦佩，今见各国兵与中国情形相同，方知此次之败，非战之罪也。德璀璘云：现在德国兵如此无理，我亦羞辱，但我国亦以我为德国二毛子也。”时间相距仅六年，天津当不致出现第二个有名的德璀琳，这点我相信李书中称为“德人”是正确的。
    （三）李鸿章决定和日本作战后，临时派兵二千人渡海，援助牙山孤军。本书说：“他总要带一些外国关系才敢行动，出重价雇英国商轮高升等三船运兵，中国兵船济远等三艘护送。”（三○九页）查有关甲午战争文献，当时租英国的只是一个高升轮（载九百多兵），并非“三船”。附同高升行的是中国揉江运船。另有中国爱仁飞鲸两船援兵先两天由济远等三舰护送赴牙山是达成了任务的。（见池仲祜：甲午战事记）
    （四）马关条约签订后，李鸿章回津，称病不出“派科士达到总理衙门，叙述“李相之忠”，劝速批准和约。和约当然批准，李鸿章给福士达酬劳金十五万元。”（三三六页）按当时伍廷芳被派携约晋京，福士达系满清政府所礼聘，十五万元的酬劳金不会由李鸿章掏腰包，但原文却很易引起误解。
    （五）在义和团运动一章中，对光绪在几次会议中的反对意见，完全没有提到。对最勇敢的反对派袁昶、许景澄的下场说是：“在义和团压力下，把袁、许二人斩首”。（四四七页）亦不合事实。事实上那是因为他两人曾把慈禧太后给各省论旨，凡是外国人一律要杀的“杀”字，擅改为“保护”二字，被揭发了，惹得慈禧大怒，立命杀掉的。（但为顾体面，当时不宣布此事）。这在景善日记中，记得很明白。
    （六）本书于鸦片问题的三派，对抵抗派林则徐等认为在当时是进步分子，是对的；但在义和团运动中，对统治阶级阵营内所有赞成反对各派，一概认为要不得，不能给他们一个应有的历史评价，采取否定一切的态度，似有违历史唯物主义的观点？
    （七）统治阶级阵营中必有派别，但统治阶级的首领（皇帝）却是随着本身利益为转移，并不会固定属于那一派。本书叙述道光皇帝采取派系观点，便不免时有矛盾。如赞成林则徐禁烟的道光（旻宁），照著者意思该是抵抗派，但本书在廿一页，因他未准山西巡抚关于准许军民告发官吏吸烟的奏折，便说：“这是投降派对抵抗派第二次打击，取得胜利。”于是道光又硬成了“投降派”；可是在二十五页因道光勖勉林则徐邓廷祯，勿信谣言，安心禁烟。本书又说：“当时旻宁的主要倾向，还在禁烟一面。”这些自相矛盾不能自圆其说的地方，如果把各派不往旻宁身上强拉，是完全可以避免的。
    （八）本书称清朝皇帝，都用本名，不用庙号，如不称道光而称“旻宁”，不称光绪而称“载湉等等。这虽是别开生面，虽有革命意义，但纪年庙号，如果说是封建性的，至少它的封建性并不算怎样严重；像道光光绪等已为妇孺均知的代名，现在舍而不用，要人民大众再记他们生疏的本名，笔者私意以为实在没有多大必要！
    上面这几点简单的意见，是否完全正确？笔者并不敢自以为是，特提出来商榷一下。还要附带声明一点，笔者并不是专究历史的，因工作上的需要，实在还只看了关于鸦片战争、甲午战争及义和团运动三部分，所以本文并非笔者对本书全部的意见。
    答复
    我们接到燕丹先生的来稿后，便把它转到中国科学近代史研究所去，由该所荣孟源同志答复如下，复文曾征得范文澜同志的同意。  编者
    （一）鸦片战争中两个义律，一为查理义律，书中简称“义律”，一为乔治义律，书中用全称。并未混淆。
    （二）德璀琳，据“东方兵事纪略”说是英国人，书中据此说是英人恐是错了，按其外文名字说亦似为德国人。
    （三）高升等三只英国船，系据王芸生“六十年中国与日本”所说，恐是错了。据“东方兵事纪略”说，“高升”为英船；其余二艘，飞鲸与爱仁无明文记载。按上下文的意义，应是两只中国船。
    （四）给科士达十五万元，是满清政府给的，书中词句，易引起误会，再版时一定改正。
    （五）袁昶、许景澄二人的死，固有擅改谕旨一说，但许袁在总理各国事务衙门行走，是否有可能来改论旨，颇可怀疑。即便改谕旨，亦不过是他反义和团行动之一。据《拳祸记》说：许袁被杀的理由是：①五月廿、廿一日御前会议时，反对用义和团；②李秉衡北上途中，捕获奸谍，搜得许致南方某制军书与袁致某督办书，书中将北京情形，和盘托出；③许袁上疏请剿义和团，保护使馆；④擅改电谕。总计四条理由，都是因为反义和团。因此说他们反义和团而死，比说他们擅改谕旨而死恰当些。
    （六）义和团运动中，满清政府中有赞成与反对各派，他们有一个共同点，是对外卖国，对内压迫人民，其区别是一为不能镇压义和团时，就利用义和团，要在利用中消灭义和团；一为始终是镇压义和团；一为到了一定时期，就公然卖国；一为始终就卖国；实在没有办法说他们那一派“要得”。这和鸦片战争中投降、抵抗二派有落后与进步之区别不同，与康有为在戊戌变法时有一定的进步性不同。
    （七）鸦片战争中皇帝虽然为其本身利益，可以一时接近那一派，一时又接近另一派，但是他绝不是超然的。如旻宁虽然他曾赞成林则徐禁烟，但他是为自己利益打算的，和林则徐等不同，所以认真禁烟，对他不利时，他就反对禁烟了。书中说旻宁动摇，并不矛盾。
    （八）对于皇帝称本名，我们认为是应该的。因为封建的庙号与谥号，没有再用的必要，同样是大家所不熟悉的。例如旻宁庙号是“宣宗”，谥号是“效天……（删二十字）成皇帝”，载湉庙号是“德宗”，谥号是“同天……（删十八字）景皇帝”，对于一般人说都是陌生的。既然庙号、谥号，与本名都生疏，那么宁可用本名。再者，一般人所用的“道光帝”、“光绪帝”等称号，是不科学的，不应当提倡。因为“道光”“光绪”都是年号，用它来做为人名是不对的，而且假如一人改元两次、或两次以上，那就不好称呼了，如皇太极的年号，初为“天聪”后改“崇德”，还是称他为“崇德帝”呢，还是称他为“天聪帝”呢。其他朝代，麻烦还多。所以我们主张，皇帝还是称本名好一些。
