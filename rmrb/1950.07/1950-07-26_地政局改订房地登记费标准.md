　　Land Administration Bureau Revises Standards for Real Estate Registration Fees
    [This newspaper report] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Beijing Municipal Land Administration Bureau, to facilitate the citizens, has re-stipulated the calculation methods and standards for real estate registration fees, and further simplified the registration procedures.
    Previously, the bureau's registration fees were collected based on 0.4% and 0.1% of the real estate value. The average citizen could not calculate this, so before paying the fee, they had to make a trip to the Land Administration Bureau to ask the amount in order to prepare the money. The bureau had two cadres dedicated to calculating real estate value, and they were still overwhelmed. Starting July 4th, the bureau has begun implementing a new method of paying registration fees: For general registration (first registration), transfer registration (buying and selling, inheritance, gifts, etc.), and certificate loss registration, regardless of the type and level of real estate, each room of a house will be charged at the rate of two jin of millet (up to a maximum of 200 jin per household), and land will be charged at the rate of one jin of millet per fen (up to a maximum of 100 jin per household for residential land, and up to a maximum of 50 jin for vacant land and agricultural land); change registration and correction registration will not exceed 15 jin at most; other rights registration (pawn, mortgage, land use) will be halved; cancellation registration is free.

　　地政局改订房地登记费标准
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：京市地政局为便利市民，重新规定了房地登记费的计算方法和标准，进一步简化了登记的手续。
    以前该局的登记费是根据房地产价值的千分之四及千分之一收取，一般市民不会计算，因此缴费前还得跑一趟地政局问问数目，好筹措钱，而该局有两个干部专计算房地产价值，还忙不过来。七月四日起该局已开始实行新的缴纳登记费办法：凡总登记（第一次登记）、转移登记（买卖、继承、赠与等）证照遗失登记，房地不分种类等级，房屋每间均按小米二斤收费（每户最多加至二百斤），土地按每分小米一斤收费（每户宅地最多加至一百斤，空地农地最多加至五十斤）；变更登记，更正登记最多不超过十五斤；他项权利登记（典当、抵押、地用）减半；涂销登记免费。
