　　We Must Strive to Fulfill Production Tasks to Guarantee the Liberation of Taiwan and Support the Korean People
    Beijing Machine Factory, Li Weilian, Wang Jinliang
    We have clearly recognized the American imperialists as wolves in sheep's clothing. Since their invasion of Korea, they have completely exposed their ferocious features. At the same time, on the Korean front, they have fully revealed their outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature, unable to withstand the slightest slackening in the war.
    The American imperialists also want to use the Seventh Fleet to prevent the People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. Bah! Truman and Acheson, stop daydreaming! You have already been beaten bloody by the Korean people, and you still want to taste the iron fists of the Chinese people?
    At the same time, we firmly believe that the Korean people will surely, under the leadership of their leader, General Kim Il-sung, defeat the American imperialist aggressors and the puppet Lee Seung-man gang, and achieve final victory.
    We must take practical action: work hard in production, ensure the completion of tasks, to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and to support the Korean people's war of liberation.

　　我们要以努力完成生产任务  保证解放台湾声援朝鲜人民
    北京机器厂  李维廉  王金良
    我们清楚地认识了美帝这只披着羊皮的狼，自侵略朝鲜以来便完全暴露了它的狰狞的面目；同时，在朝鲜前线上也充分表现了它的外强中干，经不起战争的松劲儿。
    美帝还想以第七舰队来阻挡人民解放军解放台湾。呸！杜鲁门、艾奇逊不要再做美梦吧！你们被朝鲜人民已经打得头破血流了，还想尝中国人民的铁拳头？
    同时，我们深信，朝鲜人民定能在自己的领袖——金日成将军的领导下，打垮美帝国主义及其傀儡李承晚匪帮的侵略，得到最后的胜利。
    我们要以实际行动：努力生产，保证完成任务，来支援人民解放军解放台湾并声援朝鲜人民解放战争。
