　　The Situation and Characteristics of Rural Hunan
　　By our Special Correspondent Li Rui

　　Twelve Years of Change

　　In the twelve years after the War of Resistance Against Japan and until liberation, the rural areas of Hunan, like those in other Kuomintang-controlled areas, underwent significant changes. The main changes were: land became more concentrated, but its use became more dispersed; feudal exploitation became more brutal; a new group of powerful landlords emerged; and, compounded by natural and man-made disasters and the endless plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the rural economy reached an unprecedented state of bankruptcy.

　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, one of the basic trends in China's land relations was the gradual concentration of land ownership, but the pace was relatively slow. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the devaluation of the puppet currency, large amounts of commercial, bureaucratic, and financial capital flowed into land speculation. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, land annexation developed at an unprecedented speed. Although Hunan was not as rampant as Sichuan, there was a wave of land grabbing in various counties on the front lines of northern Hunan at that time. After 1940, as many as 48 dikes and embankments were forcibly constructed in the lake areas. In the years since the Liberation War, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang intensified its plunder, and coupled with years of drought, this caused a decline in land prices and a general slowdown in land annexation. However, farmers were forced by disasters to sell off their small amount of land, which further created opportunities for landlords to monopolize land ownership. In disaster areas such as southern and central Hunan, the forced purchase of farmers' land at "stone grain for stone land" was still prevalent. On the eve of liberation, people were waiting for change, and land transactions mostly came to a standstill.

　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, those who annexed land were mainly local landlords and a small number of warlords and bureaucrats. In these twelve years, a new group of figures emerged. They were Kuomintang party members, bureaucrats, warlords, and commercial speculators of all sizes. Relying on political power, they used cunning and force, and were able to stir up trouble in the speculative markets to annex land. In the countryside, the emerging landlord power-holders were often several-in-one figures, namely the township chiefs, party and youth league members, "public representatives," local big shots, and also speculative merchants, some even combining the roles of bandits and local bullies. These people often became the targets of struggle after the peasants rose up. Many small and medium landlords who did not engage in speculative commerce or directly participate in reactionary groups were also oppressed by the landlord power-holders and gradually declined. At the same time, because land and grain speculation was less risky than commerce, many urban industrialists and businessmen, when they made profits, did not plan to expand their operations, but instead withdrew some funds to buy land in the countryside. They believed that business was not as reliable as land, and it could also be used to gain the trust of banks and money houses for loans. This close relationship between industry and commerce and land was fully exposed in the rent reduction and deposit refund movement in March and April of this year.

　　Under the increasingly heavy and harsh taxes imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the entire landlord class, in order to shift the burden and ensure their income, naturally intensified their exploitation of the peasants, first of all by raising rents without limit. Rent amounts increased by one-fifth, one-third, or even one-half; sharecropping tenants had their share increased by at least 10%. The amount of security deposits was also generally increased, or additional security deposits were added. Places that originally did not collect security deposits also began to require them. In addition, the attack of usury became more widespread, with grain loans, green crops loans, and mutual aid grain… the revolving exploitation led to a sharp increase in the number of indebted farmers. The landlords took advantage of the farmers' plight and seized their land through mortgage defaults. Other extra exploitation, the shifting of local donations and taxes, was also heavier than in the past. Peasants who paid the government grain requisition on behalf of the landlords had to bear all the transportation costs and expenses.

　　In order to guarantee the increase in rent, the lease terms became shorter and shorter, and tenant evictions became common. Farmers had no guarantee of land use and could be evicted at any time. Short lease terms led to a high degree of dispersion in land use. On the one hand, the landlords' land was leased to many farmers for cultivation. For example, a landlord in Jinghe Township, Shaoyang, who owned 200 piculs of grain land, had as many as 18 tenants. Some landlords deliberately bought land in a scattered manner when buying it in order to attract more tenants. On the other hand, a small-scale farmer (cultivating 40-50 piculs of grain land) had six or seven landlords. Under the heavy oppression of security deposits and rents, farmers naturally could not concentrate on production, let alone develop production.

　　As for the Kuomintang reactionary government's outrageous levies and taxes, especially the cruelty of conscription and local extortion, it is well known. Man-made disasters brought natural disasters, and natural disasters accompanied man-made disasters. In the past twelve years, the continuity and severity of disasters in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were rare in Chinese history, and famine had become the norm in rural areas. Hunan was even more plagued by continuous floods and droughts, rural vitality was exhausted, and the vast number of farmers were plunged into misery. The rural labor force and livestock greatly decreased, and production declined sharply. According to statistics from the Kuomintang government in 1946, wasteland in Hunan accounted for 40% of arable land. According to another statistic from the puppet Ministry of Food, rice production was reduced by more than one-third compared with normal years.

　　High Concentration of Land

　　The first most prominent feature of rural Hunan is the high concentration of land.

　　Land in southern China is generally more concentrated than in the north, and Hunan is more prominent than other provinces in the south, with a higher degree of concentration than neighboring Hubei and Jiangxi. According to a more reliable survey by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee Policy Research Office in four districts of Xiangyin and Hefeng Township (representing the lake area), four districts of Changsha Lituo Township, one district of Yiyang (representing the hilly area), three districts of Zhenzhong Township, Shaoyang, and one district of Yiyang (representing the mountainous area), the population and land ownership of various strata in rural areas are as follows (percentages are approximate, numbers after the decimal point are omitted):

Class	Landlord	Rich Peasant	Middle Peasant	Poor Peasant	Farm Laborer	Other
Percentage of Population	3	5	30	39	10	13
Percentage of Land	47	13	26	7		
Land per Person (mu)	19	5	2	0.2		
Percentage of Public Land						8

　　Although the above statistics are relatively reliable, they can only illustrate a basic trend in Hunan's land relations. It is estimated that the actual situation differs somewhat from this, because landlords and rich peasants generally hide more land. If the most concentrated lake area is averaged in, then landlords throughout the province own even more land.

　　There is a particularly large amount of public land (official land, clan land, temple land, school land, etc.) in rural Hunan (generally estimated to be at least 10% or more, the 8% in the table is definitely low). In reality, it is monopolized by the landlord class (and rich peasants), so the landlords, who account for approximately 3% of the population in the table, actually own 55% of the land. According to a survey of the liberated areas in North China during the War of Resistance Against Japan, landlords in general mountainous areas of North China owned about 30% of the land. Hubei's survey data (25 counties, 39 villages) showed that landlords accounted for about 3% of the population and owned about 40% of the land. This shows the high degree of land concentration in Hunan.

　　The distribution of land in Hunan's counties is very inconsistent. On a provincial scale, it can be divided into three types of areas: lake, hilly, and mountainous. The lake area has the highest concentration of land. For example, in Xiangyin, the most typical example, landlords account for only about 2% of the total number of households in the county, owning 71% of the land. In four districts of Xiangyin and Hefeng Township, landlords account for 3% of the population and own more than 60% of the land, with an average of about 80 mu per person, which can generally be regarded as a representative of the lake area. There are so-called "Lake Earth Kings" in various lake counties. According to the investigation report of the Kuomintang puppet provincial government's "Lake Earth Inspection Team" in 1946, after a very incomplete survey, "there are more than 20 people who own 10,000 to 70,000 mu of lake embankments and fields, including Chen Yusheng, Wang Yihua, Nie Shida, Tang Dongsheng, Chen Sutao, Yang Danqing, Zhang Jing, and Yang Chuanqing." The second is the hilly area. According to the survey of five districts of Changsha Lituo Township and one district of Yiyang, landlords account for 4% of the population and own 45% of the land (including public land), which can generally be regarded as a representative of the hilly area. The mountainous area is more dispersed. In mountainous areas such as western Hunan, landlords generally own about 30% to 40% of the land. According to a survey of three districts of Shaoyang, landlords account for 4% of the population and own 41% of the land (including public land). In addition, land is more concentrated near cities with developed economies and transportation (such as Changsha and Xiangtan). Remote mountainous areas are more dispersed. After the old Soviet areas of the land revolution, the land is also more dispersed.

　　Hunan's rich peasant economy is not very developed. According to the previous table, rich peasants account for about 5% of the population and own about 13% of the land, that is, the proportion of land owned by rich peasants is about one and a half times higher than the proportion of the population. A considerable portion of the land owned by rich peasants is rented out. For example, in the 16th district of Shaoyang Zhenzhong Township, the land rented out by rich peasants accounts for half of all their land. Of course, this is a higher proportion and cannot be regarded as representative. Tenant rich peasants also account for a certain number. According to the above-mentioned hilly area survey, tenant rich peasants account for about one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of rich peasants, and about one-seventh in the mountainous and lake areas. Tenant rich peasants own very little land. The main reason for the underdevelopment of the rich peasant economy is that Hunan's tenancy system is too developed. Landlords find it more profitable and reliable to collect rent than to operate the land themselves. In recent years, due to the value of grain, some landlords have taken back some land for their own operation, but it is not common and the total number is limited.

　　The population proportion of middle peasants is equivalent to the land proportion, which is similar to the situation in North China and other places. There are many tenant middle peasants among the middle peasants. According to the above-mentioned survey, they account for about one-third of the total number of middle peasants. The number of tenant middle peasants in the lake area exceeds the number of self-cultivating middle peasants, accounting for more than one-third of self-cultivating middle peasants in the hilly area, and about one-fifth in the mountainous area. Tenant middle peasants own very little land. Therefore, in general, self-cultivating middle peasants own more than one person's land. Middle peasants in the lake area own an average of more than 4 mu of land per person, while those in the hilly and mountainous areas generally own less than 2 mu.

　　In general, 3% of the population owns 50-60% of the land, while more than 60% of the population owns less than 10% of the land.

　　Many Poor Peasants, Hired Peasants and Destitute Households

　　The second prominent feature of rural Hunan is that there are a particularly large number of landless and land-poor peasants, hired peasants and destitute households. Chairman Mao said thoroughly during the Great Revolution: "According to the survey in Changsha: poor peasants account for 70%... Among the 70% of poor peasants, they are divided into two categories: extremely poor and moderately poor. Those who are completely unemployed, that is, have no land and no capital, and have completely lost their means of livelihood, and have no choice but to go out to be soldiers, or go out to work, or wander around as beggars, or engage in wrongdoing and become thieves, are all 'extremely poor', accounting for 20% of the 70%. Those who are semi-unemployed, that is, have a little land or a little capital, but eat more and earn less, and live in labor and sorrow all year round, such as handicraft workers, tenant farmers (except for rich tenant farmers), and semi-self-cultivating farmers, are all 'moderately poor', accounting for 50% of the 70%." ("Report on the Investigation of the Hunan Peasant Movement") Chairman Mao's survey still summarizes this characteristic of rural Hunan today. Today's situation is only worse than that in Changsha during the Great Revolution.

　　According to the previous table, the poor peasant population is 39%. The hired peasant population is 10%. Among the "other" 13%, most are handicraft workers, small vendors, porters, and destitute households with no occupation at all. Therefore, hired peasants and destitute households actually account for about 20% of the population in rural areas. The total number of poor peasants, hired peasants and destitute households in the province is undoubtedly more than 60%. Because in areas with the highest concentration of land and population, there are particularly many poor peasants, hired peasants, and destitute households. For example, tenant farmers generally account for more than 90% in the lake areas. If this is averaged in, the total number of poor peasants, hired peasants, and destitute households in the province will not be limited to the 62% in the previous table. The vast number of poor peasants own very little land, only 7% (the survey in North China is 19%, and Hubei is 20%). Hired peasants and destitute households "have no land and no capital."

　　The reason for the particularly large number of poor peasants, hired peasants, and destitute households is due to severe feudal exploitation, high land concentration, and years of natural and man-made disasters. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the number of middle peasants who were downgraded to poor peasants and hired peasants, and the number of poor peasants who were downgraded to destitute households, obviously increased. In the past twelve years, according to the puppet government's statistics, the number of young men conscripted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from Hunan from 1937 to 1945 was more than 1.78 million. Although some of them escaped back, the total number is still alarming. In recent years, due to continuous disasters, the number of people leaving the village has also increased. At the same time, the mortality rate of the rural population is very high. These huge numbers of people who have been reduced in rural areas are naturally mainly poor peasants and hired peasants. Therefore, the above table shows that the statistics of poor peasants, hired peasants and destitute households are still above 60%, which can also illustrate the trend of the decline of middle peasants and the increasing growth of poor peasants and hired peasants.

　　Since poor peasants and hired peasants cannot make a living by farming, they seek other ways of life. Farming is only "earning a room to live in and keeping a nest." The way they supplement their lives is to engage in sideline production, learn handicrafts (such as carpentry and masonry), work odd jobs, long-term labor, portering, sedan carrying, vegetable growing, etc. Women also try their best to spin cotton, weave hemp, and pick wild vegetables to help. However, due to war damage, traffic disruption, and other reasons, sideline and handicraft industries are difficult to maintain. Therefore, poor peasants and hired peasants generally cannot maintain a minimum standard of living. Some flee to find food, some seek life in the city, and some have to die of hunger, cold, and disease. It is difficult to imagine the blood and tears and suffering of Hunan's peasants without going to the countryside to see it.

　　This army of poor peasants and hired peasants, accounting for 60% to 70% of the rural population, is the main force of all reforms in rural areas today, and their demand for land is the most urgent. Therefore, how to solve the land demands of poor peasants and hired peasants, especially the 20% or so of the extremely poor, is the most urgent problem facing us.

　　Unusually Cruel Feudal Exploitation

　　The third feature is unusually cruel feudal exploitation. Many people say that the exploitation of landlords in Hunan is not as heavy as in the north, which is fundamentally wrong.

　　The tenancy system in southern provinces has always been more developed than in the north. According to a survey before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the proportion of tenant farmers and semi-tenant farmers in the total number of farmers was 40% in ten northern provinces and 70% in twelve southern provinces; Hunan was 77%. The relationship between landlords and peasants in Hunan is mainly reflected in the tenancy relationship. The vast majority of land controlled by landlords is rented out. This form of tenancy exploitation may seem more civilized on the surface than some forms of labor service in North China, but in reality it is more severe and cruel. The most prominent is the barbaric security deposit system, which is generally rare in the north. In Hunan, the security deposit system is widely used except in a few areas in southern and western Hunan. The security deposit is an extra burden on the tenant to the landlord in addition to the rent; in essence, it is a guarantee for the tenant to sell himself to the landlord. Without this guarantee, the tenant is not qualified to be included in the landlord's serf army. Landlords use security deposits to more easily monopolize land, accumulate usury capital and commercial capital to bind farmers. Many farmers are in debt when paying the security deposit, and they will not be able to pay it off for a long time or even forever. The amount of the security deposit is most commonly equal to one year's rent, called "even security and even rent" (security is the deposit), but there are also so-called "heavy security and light rent" and "light security and heavy rent," etc., which are just tricks that landlords use to facilitate exploitation depending on the situation. If the farmer cannot pay the security deposit in full at one time, the landlord will add interest every year and deduct it from the rent grain. Some landlords even lend the security deposit to the farmer at high interest. According to the literal provisions, the security deposit paid to the landlord should be fully refunded when the tenant leaves, but the landlord always tries every treacherous means to discount it until it disappears.

　　Fixed rent is the most common form of rent, and sharecropping is not popular. Fixed rent is generally divided equally between the landlord and the tenant according to the output of the rented field written in the lease. Due to the amount of security deposit and other reasons, there are also different forms such as landlord-tenant four-six, six-four, three-seven, and seven-three. For land without security deposit, the harvest is mostly landlord seven, tenant three, and some even landlord eight, tenant two or even landlord nine, tenant one. However, in general, the output set in the lease is higher than the actual output, so nominally it is half, but in reality the landlord receives a higher percentage than the fixed amount. If the security deposit interest is included in the rent, the actual rent is much higher than the fixed rent rate. The heavier the security deposit, the higher the actual rent.

　　As for other extra exploitation, it is simply impossible to write clearly. The Xiangzhong Daily of Yiyang Prefecture published an article on February 4th of this year, with statistics showing that there are 120 kinds of exploitation methods by landlords. Here are a few of the more familiar ones. For example, falsely reporting the number of fields, called "writing false estates" in Changsha and "opening fields on paper" in Ningxiang, means that the number of fields on the lease is more than the actual number, so some rents are nominally light, but in reality they are very heavy. For example, turning rent arrears into high-interest loans, with livestock and sundries as collateral. For example, "adding rent for manure fertility," that is, if the tenant fertilizes the field well, the landlord will increase the rent. For example, water rent, the tenant has to pay a certain amount of grain rent for every picul of field that uses water from the landlord's pond. For example, designated storage for rent payment, the rent grain must be sent to the location designated by the landlord, which requires a lot of labor. For example, when delivering rent grain, the wind turbine is heavily tightened, and four or five liters more must be processed per picul. For example, sending gifts (exploitation of by-products), sending rent chickens, rent fish, rent meat, rice straw, beans, and whatever is available in the mountains. For example, inviting to drink, inviting to "spring wine," "new rice wine," "watching the rice wine," "writing security contract wine." For example, using big measures to collect and small measures to lend out. For example, unpaid labor service: carrying sedan chairs, pounding rice, carrying water, drying grain, fishing, repairing houses, red and white weddings, at least a dozen workdays a year, and as many as thirty or forty workdays. Farmers cannot finish talking about these extra exploitation methods in one day and one night.

　　Usury is very common and very complex in Hunan, and it has been particularly cruel in the past twelve years. I will not go into details here.

　　Under such severe and cruel exploitation, more than 90% of the farmer's normal production harvest is squeezed away, making it difficult not only to reproduce, but also to continue life. This is the basic reason for rural bankruptcy, all spring famines and summer famines. This is the fundamental reason why farmers work hard to the end but still have to eat chaff and grass all year round.

　　The Poisonous Ruling Means

　　The ruthlessness of the Hunan landlord class in political and ideological ruling means is also very prominent in the country. They have both the barbaric characteristics of northern landlords and the cunning characteristics of southern landlords. They truly inherited the mantle of Zeng Guofan and Zuo Zongtang and were influenced by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They used the yamen baojia (political power), local defense bandits (military power), ancestral hall clan law (clan power), public and private schools (academic power), temples and secret societies (divine power). In the past twelve years, they have borrowed the Kuomintang's party, league, assembly (parliament), and special (agents) to tie the peasants tightly.

　　The rural township chiefs are either landlords who personally take charge or are manipulated by them behind the scenes. It is rare elsewhere for divisional commanders to run local defense when they are idle, and for pork chop congressmen in their sixties and seventies to compete to be township chiefs. In order to control school land and public property and squeeze the peasants' oil and water, Hunan landlords are best at using the methods of running schools, running charity halls, repairing bridges and roads, and accumulating grain to "prevent famine," which is a way to gain both fame and fortune. There are particularly many ancestral halls, temples, and schools in rural Hunan, which are all good tools for them to carry out their rule. Ancestral clan law happens to confuse the peasants' class consciousness. "Reading teachers" are especially respected in rural areas. As for secret societies, divination, and establishing altars, they have deceived and won over tens of millions of farmers.

　　The barbaric rule of the Hunan landlord class is most prominent in the lake area and western Hunan. The lake area is a world of "strong control of the land and hegemonic control of the water." Whoever has power can occupy land and build embankments. When competing for land, tenants are driven by both "land kings" to kill each other. The most barbaric ones even rob the other side's tenants, kill them, and eat human flesh cooked in pots. The saying popular in western Hunan is: "If you have a gun, you have power; if you have power, you have an official."

　　Therefore, some people describe the Hunan landlord class as "capable in both civil and military affairs," "able to bend and stretch," "half new and half old," "both officials and merchants," "playing with words and ink," and "creating troubles out of nothing." It is indeed true.

　　After liberation, the landlord class has a lot of conspiracies and tricks: running fake peasant associations, colluding with bandits, sowing discord, treating guests and sending gifts, using families, and using beauty traps… Many cadres have been fooled. In contrast to the cruel exploitation, ruthless rule, and the plunder and suppression by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of the landlord class, the Hunan peasants, who have a revolutionary tradition, have a particularly high revolutionary enthusiasm, and their demand for land is very urgent. This has been enthusiastically expressed in the movements of requisitioning grain, supporting the front, suppressing bandits, opposing hegemony, reducing rent, and production for disaster relief after liberation. I will not say much about these situations.

　　湖南农村的状况和特点
    本报特约记者  李锐
            十二年来的变化
    抗战后直到解放前的十二年，湖南的农村像其他国民党统治区的农村一样，有过很大的变化。主要是：土地更加集中，使用却更加分散，封建剥削更加残酷，起来一批新兴的当权地主，加以天灾人祸，蒋匪无限劫掠，农村经济达到空前破产的程度。
    在抗战前，中国土地关系的基本趋向之一，是地权日渐集中，但速度是比较缓慢的。抗战八年期间，由于伪法币的贬值，大批商业、官僚和金融资本都趋向于土地投机，在国民党统治区，土地的兼并就以前所未有的速度发展着。湖南虽不如四川之凶猛，但当时即处于湘北前线的各县，也都有过土地争购的浪潮。一九四○年以后，滨湖各县强挽的堤垸即达四十八个。解放战争以来这几年，蒋匪掠夺更紧，又连年灾荒，曾引起地价下跌，和土地兼并的一般迟缓。但农民被灾荒逼迫，抛售仅有的小量土地，因而也更造成地主垄断地权的机会，如湘南、湘中各地灾区，以“石谷石田”强迫收买农民土地者，仍在在皆是。解放前夜，人心待变，土地买卖多趋停顿。
    在抗战前，兼并土地者主要是土著的地主和少数军阀官僚分子；这十二年来，换了一批新的人物，他们是国民党的大小党棍、官僚、军阀和商业投机家，他们依靠政治权力巧取强夺，又能在投机市场上兴波作浪，以进行土地的吞并。在乡村中，新兴地主当权派，多是几位一体的人物，即乡保长、党团分子、“民意代表”、圈子大爷、又兼投机商人，有的更兼土匪恶霸。这些人往往就成为农民起来后的斗争对象。一般不会兼营投机商业，不直接参与反动集团的中小地主，有许多也受地主当权派的压迫而日渐没落。同时，因为土地与粮食的投机比商业更少风险，也有许多城市的工商业者获得盈利时，不作扩大经营的打算，却抽出部分资金下乡买田，他们认为生意不如田地牢靠，而且也可借此取得银行钱庄等放款挪借的信任。这种工商业与土地的紧密关系，在今年三四月减租退押运动中，曾全面暴露出来。
    在蒋匪帮日益加紧的苛重赋税下，整个地主阶级为了转嫁负担，保证收益，对农民的剥削当然就日益加紧，首先是无限制地抬高地租。租额增高五分之一、三分之一乃至二分之一不等；分租制者至少提高一成。押租也是普遍提高，或者追加押租，原来不收押租的地方，也要交押。此外高利贷的进攻也更加普遍，谷贷、青苗、会谷……辗转盘剥，农民负债户剧增，地主更乘农民之危，死当夺地。其他额外剥削，地方捐税转嫁，也比过去加重，农民代地主缴纳征实，更要负担全部运输上的消耗和化费。
    地主为了保证加租，租佃期限就日趋缩短，退佃成风，农民使用土地毫无保证，随时有被撤佃的可能。租期短促，于是更加形成了土地使用的高度分散。一方面，地主的土地分散出租给很多农民耕种，如邵阳靖合乡有一个二百石谷田的地主，佃户多至十八人；有的地主在买田时就故意买得分散，以便多招佃户。另一方面，一个小规模经营的农民（如作四五十石谷田），却有六七个东家。农民在押佃重重剥削下，自然无法安心生产，更谈不到发展生产。
    至于国民党反动政府的横征暴敛，特别是抓壮丁和地方勒索的残酷，更是众所周知。人祸带来天灾，天灾伴随人祸，十二年来，国民党统治区灾荒的连续性与惨重程度，实为中国历史上所少有，灾荒饥馑已成为农村常态。湖南更是连年水旱，农村元气耗尽，广大农民陷于水深火热之中，农村劳力与畜力大大减少，生产急剧衰落。据一九四六年国民党政府统计，湖南荒地达耕地百分之四十。另一伪粮食部的统计，稻谷产量比常年产量减少三分之一以上。
        土地高度集中
    湖南农村最显著的第一个特点，便是土地的高度集中。
    中国南方的土地一般比北方集中，湖南在南方各省又较突出，比邻近的湖北、江西集中的程度都高。根据湖南省委政策研究室在湘阴和丰乡四个保（代表滨湖区），长沙黎托乡四个保、益阳一个保（代表丘陵区），邵阳震中乡三个保、益阳一个保（代表山区）的较可靠调查，农村各阶层人口与土地占有的情况，有如下表（百分比取约数，小数点以下数略去）阶级        地主  富农  中农  贫农  雇农   其他人口百分比   三    五    三○  三九  一○   一三土地百分比   四七  一三  二六  七每人占地（亩）一九  五    二   ○·二公田百分比                           八
    上表统计虽较可靠，但仍只能说明湖南土地关系的一个基本趋势。估计实际情况与此有若干差别，因地主、富农一般瞒田较多，如将土地最集中的滨湖区平均计入，则全省地主占有土地或更多。
    湖南农村中的公田（官田、族田、寺田、学田等）特别多（一般估计至少在百分之十以上，表中百分之八肯定是低了的），实际上为地主阶级（和部主富农）所垄断，因此上表约占人口百分之三的地主，占有土地实达百分之五十五。据抗战期中华北各解放区的调查，华北一般山区，地主约占土地百分之三十。湖北的调查材料（二十五个县三十九个村），地主占人口约百分之三强，占有土地约百分之四十左右。由此可知湖南土地集中的高度。
    湖南各县土地分配的情况是很不一致的。按全省范围说来，可以分作滨湖、丘陵、山地这样三种地区。滨湖区域土地最集中，如最典型的湘阴，全县地主只占户数百分之二左右，占有土地达百分之七十一。湘阴和丰乡四个保，地主占人口百分之三，土地占百分之六十以上，平均每人占地约达八十亩，大体可作为滨湖区代表。滨湖各县都有所谓“洲土大王”，据国民党伪省府一九四六年“滨湖洲土视察团”的调查报告，很不完全的查勘，“拥有一万至七万亩洲土垸田者，有陈浴笙、王一华、聂士达、汤冬生、陈肃涛、杨丹青、张经、杨传清等二十余人。”其次是丘陵地区，据长沙黎托乡五个保、益阳一个保调查，地主占人口百分之四，占土地百分之四十五（公田在内），大体可作为丘陵区的代表。山区较为分散：湘西等地山区，地主一般占地约百分之三十至四十；据邵阳三个保调查，地主占人口百分之四，占土地百分之四十一（公田在内）。此外，在经济、交通发达的城市附近（如长沙、湘潭），土地比较集中。偏僻山区比较分散。经过土地革命的老苏区，土地也比较分散。
    湖南的富农经济是并不发达的。据前表，富农占人口约百分之五，占土地约百分之十三，即富农占有土地的比重比人口的比重约高一倍半，富农占有土地中，有相当一部分出租，如邵阳震中乡十六保，富农出租地占其所有地一半，当然这是较高的比例，不能作为代表。佃富农亦占有一定的数目，上述丘陵区调查，佃富农约占富农人数四分之一至五分之一，山区和滨湖区约占七分之一。佃富农占有的土地很少。富农经济不发达的最主要原因，是湖南租佃制度太发达，地主收租比自己经营划得来，收益可靠些，近年来由于粮食值钱，也有地主收回部分土地自己经营的，但不普遍，总数也有限。
    中农的人口比重与土地比重相当，这与华北和其他各地情形差不多。中农中佃中农人数很多，据上述调查，大约占中农总数三分之一左右。滨湖区佃中农数超过自耕中农数，丘陵区约占自耕中农三分之一以上，山区约占五分之一。佃中农占有土地当然很少。因此一般自耕中农，每人不只占一个人土地。滨湖区中农平均每人占地在四亩以上，丘陵区、山区一般均不及二亩。
    总的说来，百分之三的人口，占了百分之五六十的土地；而百分之六十以上的人口，只有不到百分之十的土地。（⑴⑵）
            贫雇农赤贫户多
    湖南农村第二个显著的特点，就是无地少地的贫农和雇农赤贫户特别多。毛主席在大革命时就透彻地说到这种情形：“据长沙的调查：贫农占百分之七十……。百分之七十的贫农中，又分赤贫、次贫二类。全然无业，即既无土地，又无资本，完全失去生活依据，不得不出外当兵，或出外做工，或打流当乞丐，或为非作歹做盗贼的，都是“赤贫”，占七十分之二十。半无业，即略有土地或略有资本，但吃的多，收的少，终年在劳碌愁苦中过生活的，如手工工人、佃农（富佃除外）、半自耕农等，都是“次贫”，占七十分之五十。”（“湖南农民运动考察报告”）毛主席当年的调查仍旧概括了今天湖南农村的这个特点。今天的情形与大革命时长沙相较，只有过之而无不及。
    根据前表，贫农人口为百分之三十九。雇农为百分之十。“其他”百分之十三中，多为手工工人、小商贩、担脚的和根本无职业的赤贫户等。因此雇农和赤贫户在农村中实占人口百分之二十左右。全省贫雇农赤贫户总数，无疑在百分之六十以上。因为在土地和人口最集中的地区，贫雇农赤贫户特别多，如滨湖垸田中佃农一般占百分之九十以上，如将此平均算入，全省贫雇农赤贫总数就不会止于前表的百分之六十二。广大的贫农占有土地是极少的，只百分之七（华北调查是百分之十九，湖北百分之二十）。雇农赤贫“既无土地，又无资本”。
    造成贫雇农赤贫特多的原因，是由于封建剥削厉害，土地高度集中，以及历年天灾人祸所致。抗战后，中农下降为贫雇农，贫农下降为赤贫者，显然日益加多。十二年来，湖南壮丁被蒋匪帮征调者，据伪政府统计自一九三七年至一九四五年约一七八万余人，其中虽有部分逃回，但总数还是惊人的；近年来因灾荒不断，离村人口也日多；同时农村人口死亡率很大，这些农村减少的巨量人口，自然主要都是贫雇农。因此上表贫雇农赤贫统计仍在百分之六十以上，亦可说明中农下降，贫雇农日益增长的趋势。
    贫雇农既不能靠耕作糊口，便多另求生活，所谓作田只是“赚间屋住、留个窝窠”而已。他们补助生活的办法多从事副业生产，学习手艺（泥木匠等），打零工、长工、挑脚、抬轿、作土种菜等。女人也尽量纺纱绩麻拔野菜，以资补助。但因战争损毁，交通断绝等原因，副业及手工业都很难维持，因此贫雇农一般无法保持最低限度的生活，有的逃亡觅食，有的城市求生，有的便只得在饥寒病中走向死亡。湖南农民的血泪和惨苦，不到农村去看看是难以想像的。
    这支占农村人口百分之六十到七十的贫雇农大军，就是今日农村一切改革的主力，他们对土地要求也最为迫切。因此如何解决贫雇农特别是百分之二十左右的赤贫的土地要求，是摆在我们面前最迫切的问题。
            封建剥削异常残酷
    第三个特点，是封建剥削异常残酷。许多人说，湖南地主的剥削不如北方重，这是根本不对的。
    南方各省的租佃制度，历来比北方发达。据抗战前调查，佃农与半佃农合占全体农民的比例，北方十省为百分之四十，南方十二省占百分之七十；湖南为百分之七十七。湖南地主与农民的关系，主要表现在租佃关系上，地主掌握的土地绝大部分是出租的。这种租佃形式的剥削，表面上似乎比华北某些劳役形式文明些，而实际上更厉害、更残酷。最突出的便是野蛮的押租制度，这是北方一般少见的。湖南除了湘南及湘西少数地区外，押租制度普遍存在。押租是佃户对地主除地租外的一种额外负担；本质上，这是佃农给地主卖身的保证金，没有这笔保证金，佃户就没有资格列入地主的农奴队伍。地主利用押金，更便于垄断土地，积累高利贷资本和商业资本，来束缚农民。许多农民都是在交押金的时候背了债，长期甚至永远还不清。押金的数量，最普通的与一年租额相等，叫做“平批平租”（批即押金），但也还有所谓“重批轻租”、“轻批重租”等，这不过是地主因时制宜便于剥削的花样而已。农民如不能一次将押金交清，地主就要年年加息，在租谷内扣交，有的地主更将押金再以高利贷放给农民。交给地主的押金，按照字面上的规定，退佃时应全部退还，但地主总是想尽一切奸诈手段，七折八扣，直至化为乌有。
    地租以额租最普遍，分租不流行。额租一般是按租约上书写的出租田的产量，主佃对半分。由于押金轻重及其他原因，又有主佃四六、六四、三七、七三等不同形式。不缴押租田地，收获多东七佃三，也有东八佃二甚至东九佃一的。然而通常租约，额定产量多高于实际产量，因此名义上是对半，实际上地主收的成数要高过定额。如果以押金利息计入地租，则实际地租就比额定租率更要高得多。押租愈重，实际地租愈高。
    至于其他的额外剥削，简直没有办法写得清楚。今年二月四日益阳专区的湘中日报，刊载一篇统计材料，地主的剥削花样有一百二十种。以下举出大家较熟悉的几种。例如虚报田数，长沙叫“写冒庄”，宁乡叫“纸上开田”，就是租约上的田数比实际要多，所以有的租额名义轻，而实际上很重。例如欠租转为高利贷行息，以牲畜什物作押。例如“粪厚加租”，佃户把田种肥了，地主就要加租。例如水租，佃户用地主塘里的水，每石田要交多少谷租。例如指仓交租，租谷要送到地主指定的地点去，耗费劳力很大。例如交租“车谷”时，风车重绞，每石要多车四五升。例如送礼（副产物剥削），送租鸡、租鱼、租肉、稻草、豆子、山里有什么就要送什么。例如请酒，请“春酒”、“新米酒”、“看禾酒”、“写批酒”。例如大斗收进，小斗借出。例如无偿劳役：抬轿、舂米、挑水、晒谷、打鱼、修房、红白喜事，每年少则十几工，多则三四十工。……这些额外剥削，农民讲一天一晚也讲不完。
    高利贷在湖南是很普遍很复杂的，这十二年来特别残酷，这里不多赘述。
    在这样严重的残酷的剥削下面，农民往往百分之九十以上的正产收获都被压榨去了，不但难以进行再生产，连生命都无法延续。这就是农村破产，一切春荒、夏荒的基本原因，这就是为什么农民辛苦到头，还要长年吃糠、吃草的根本原因。
            统治手段的毒辣
    湖南地主阶级在政治与思想上统治手段的毒辣，在全国也是很突出的。他们既有北方地主野蛮的特性，又有南方地主狡猾的特性。真是上承曾、左衣钵，下受蒋匪熏陶。他们利用衙门保甲（政权），团防土匪（兵权），祠堂宗法（族权），公私学堂（学权），庙宇会门（神权），近十二年来，更是借国民党的党、团、参（议会）、特（务），将农民束缚得紧紧的。
    农村的乡保长，不是地主亲自出马，必由他们幕后操纵。像师长赋闲时办团防，六七十岁的猪仔国会议员争做保长，这在别处都是很少见的。为了掌握学田公产，搜刮农民油水，湖南地主最善于采用办学校、办善堂、修桥补路、积谷“防饥”，这一套名利双收的办法。湖南农村的祠堂、庙宇和学校特别多，这都是他们进行统治的好工具。祖宗族法恰好迷糊了农民的阶级觉悟。“读书先生”在农村分外受人尊敬。至于圈子会门，扶乩立坛，更不知欺骗笼络了多少千万的农民。
    湖南地主阶级的野蛮统治，在滨湖和湘西表现得最为突出。滨湖是“强管洲，霸管水”的世界，谁有权有势，谁就可以占地挽垸。争夺洲土时，佃户被双方“洲土大王”驱使互相残杀，最野蛮者有将对方佃户抢来杀掉，用锅子煮人肉吃的。湘西土匪恶霸地主，自筑寨堡，自设关卡，自立公堂，烧杀劫掠是家常便饭。湘西流行的说法是：“有枪就有势，有势就有官”。
    所以有人形容湖南地主阶级，说他们“能文能武”、“能屈能伸”、“半新半旧”、“亦官亦商”、“舞文弄墨”、“好事生非”。确实是一点不错的。
    解放后，地主阶级的阴谋花样极多，办假农会，勾结土匪，挑拨离间，请客送礼，利用家族，施美人计……不少的干部上过当。与地主阶级这种残酷剥削、毒辣统治，以及蒋匪帮劫掠镇压相对称的，是具有革命传统的湖南农民，他们的革命热情特别高涨，他们对土地的要求十分迫切。这在解放后征粮、支前、剿匪、反霸、减租和生产救灾等运动中，都热烈表现出来。这些情形就不多说了。
