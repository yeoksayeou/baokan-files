　　Anti-Peace, Anti-United Nations Conspirators
　　Ma, Lining

　　The movement to defend peace is growing, consolidating, and possessing a more active and effective nature. It has become a truly worldwide and all-people movement. The movement to defend peace has become one of the most important factors in the entire international life of modern times.

　　The more extensive and effective the struggle to defend peace, the more profound the political bankruptcy of today's rulers of the United States will be. Truman and Dulles, Acheson and Vandenberg, are using all kinds of methods of their infamous "total propaganda" to try to hide the crisis of their political line from the masses, to intimidate the ordinary people of the United States with hysterical cries about the "threat of communism" and "the extremely tense international situation," and to try to force them to echo the White House by this method.

　　The fraudulent nature of this new movement is becoming more and more obvious. "Total diplomacy" not only uses intimidation tactics abroad, but also uses them against the American people. The anti-peace conspiracy of the reactionary Wall Street group is a conspiracy of the war-mongering group against all ethnic groups, including the American people.

　　The failure of the policy of the ruling group of the United States looks particularly clear on an international scale. The isolation of the war-mongers is undoubtedly a characteristic of the current international situation. No amount of "total" and "super-total" shouting can hide this iron fact. In the face of the great movement to defend peace, Truman and Acheson and their Western European and other agents appear to the whole of humanity as a handful of anti-peace conspirators. Their sabotage activities arouse the hatred of the vast majority of people in the world.

　　Obviously, the US imperialists have regarded force as the decisive and main factor in national and state relations, in which there is no room for the implementation of international peace cooperation policies, thus undermining the foundation on which the United Nations was established. The anti-United Nations conspiracy is an inseparable part of the anti-peace conspiracy of US imperialism.

　　Since the first day of the establishment of the United Nations Organization, the Soviet Union, which represented the aspirations of the people of all countries for peace and the strengthening of international security, has wanted to turn it into an effective international cooperation organization and a powerful tool for peace.

　　Comrade Stalin stated in response to questions from American journalists on March 22, 1946: "I believe that the United Nations Organization is of great significance because it is an important tool for maintaining peace and international security. The strength of this international organization lies in the fact that it is based on the principle of equality among all countries, rather than on the principle of some countries dominating other countries. If the United Nations Organization succeeds in maintaining the principle of equality, then it will undoubtedly play a major positive role in safeguarding world peace and security."

　　Experience has proven that the destructive tactics of the ruling group of the United States are aimed primarily at destroying this basic principle. In fact, since the establishment of the United Nations, the US representatives have always strived to counter the principle of equality among large and small countries with their policy of dominating everything, with their approach of suppressing the independent will of the people of all countries, and with their attempt to turn any form of international control into a tool of US aggression policy.

　　One of the obvious manifestations of the conspiracy policy of the US ruling group in the United Nations Organization is their entire strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to create a notorious "voting machine" through various behind-the-scenes maneuvers, while at the same time using open pressure, fraud, and intimidation. Even children can understand that this so-called mathematical majority, artificially pieced together by the Anglo-American group, completely fails to represent the actual relationship of world forces. This is nothing more than a challenge to the will and demands of millions of people in all countries. However, the US ruling group, which is devoted to its aggressive goals, has used this "voting machine" to systematically damage the United Nations Organization.

　　With the establishment of the aggressive North Atlantic Group, the US ruling group began to increasingly oppose the whole world, increasingly stubbornly acting as anti-peace conspirators. The North Atlantic Group is a landmine buried under the United Nations. Therefore, after the North Atlantic Group became a reality, the efforts of the American conspirators to harm the United Nations have taken on a more solidified and intense nature.

　　From this, it can be seen that although the US ruling group hypocritically says that they hold a "supportive attitude" towards the United Nations, they are actually its enemies, and they conspire to destroy it. At the same time, it can be seen that in the great upsurge of the people of all countries defending peace, the United Nations, which plays a normal and effective role, is particularly unacceptable to Truman and Acheson and their ilk. If it were not for fear of arousing fierce protests from millions of people around the world, the American anti-peace conspirators would have directly raised the issue of abolishing the United Nations long ago.

　　However, although the US ruling group is actually carrying out the work of disintegrating and destroying the United Nations from within, they often spread false sophistry about the benefits and needs of the United Nations in order to appease the politically short-sighted, considering the unprecedented scale of the movement to defend peace.

　　The people cannot be deceived, they have a healthy feeling and discerning eyes. They do not believe in those flowery words, but have their own opinions, their own judgments based on real facts. All the facts thoroughly expose the anti-peace American conspirators.

　　The people of all countries around the world wholeheartedly welcome the great contribution made by the Soviet Union to consolidating peace and international security, and they firmly recognize that the Soviet Union is a reliable fortress of peace and friendship among all countries. They recognize that the Soviet Union is fighting for the vital interests of all peace-loving people. (Junqiang's abridged translation from the June 24th Pravda)

### 反和平、反联合国的阴谋家

　　反和平、反联合国的阴谋家
    马里宁
    保卫和平运动增长着，巩固着，并且具有着更加积极和有效的性质。它已变成了真正全世界的、全人民的运动。保卫和平运动已变成现代整个国际生活中最重要因素之一了。
    保卫和平的斗争愈是广泛而且有效，美国今日的统治者在政治上的破产就将表现得愈深刻。杜鲁门和杜勒斯、艾奇逊和范登堡之流，正在利用他们那声名狼藉的“总体宣传”的各种方法，力图向人民大众隐瞒他们政治路线的危机。
    但是，“总体宣传”不过是一种棱枪。它促使战争挑拨者显露出自己的面目。它使世界上各国诚实的人们明白，这正是美国统治集团的政治崩溃的明显证据和政治破产者的策动而已。
    杜鲁门和艾奇逊以及陆海军全体高级伙伴最近所发表的许多言论，目的首先在于转移美国人民对白宫的日益增长的不满情绪，在于用关于“共产主义的威胁”以及“国际局势非常紧张”等等歇斯底里的叫嚣来威吓美国的普通人民，想用这种方法强迫他们对于白宫随声附和。
    这个新运动的诈骗的性质愈来愈明显了。“总体外交”不仅对国外施行恐吓手段，而且也用此来对付美国人民。反动的华尔街集团反和平的阴谋，就是战争贩子集团反对各族人民，包括美国人民在内的阴谋。
    美国统治集团政策的失败，在国际规模上看起来显得格外清楚。战争贩子的孤立，无疑地是目前国际形势中的一个特点。任何“总体的”和“超总体的”叫嚣，都不能掩饰这个铁的事实。在伟大的保卫和平运动的情况下，杜鲁门和艾奇逊之流与其西欧的及其他代理人们，在全人类面前表现为一撮反和平的阴谋家。他们的破坏行为，引起全球绝大多数人民的憎恨。
    显然的，美帝国主义者已把武力视为民族关系与国家关系中的具有决定性的主要因素，在其中就没有实行国际和平合作政策的余地，因而破坏了联合国赖以建立的基础。反联合国的阴谋是美帝国主义反和平阴谋的不可分的一部分。
    自联合国组织成立的第一天起，表示各国人民对和平、对加强国际安全的愿望的苏联，就想把它变为一个有效的国际合作机构、一个有力的和平的工具。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年三月二十二日回答美国记者的问题时，曾声明：“我认为联合国组织是有巨大意义的。因为它是维护和平与国际安全的一个重要的工具。这个国际组织的力量，在于它是建立在各国平等的原则的上面，而不是建立在某些国家支配其他国家的原则的上面。假若联合国组织要在维持平等的原则上获得成功的话，那么它在保障世界的和平与安全的上面，无疑地将要担任一个重大的积极的作用。”
    经验证明，美国统治集团的破坏性的策略，其目的首先在于摧毁这个基本的原则。事实上，自联合国成立以来，美国代表们始终努力以他们支配一切的政策、以他们压抑各国人民自主意志的方针、以他们想把任何国际管制的方式变为美国侵略政策之工具的企图，来对抗大小国家平等的原则。
    美国统治集团在联合国组织方面的阴谋政策显明的表现之一，就是他们的全部策略。这个策略的目的在于用各种幕后策动，同时借助公开的压力、诈骗和威吓来造成声名狼藉的“投票机器”。甚至小孩子都会明白，这种由英美集团人工拼凑成的所谓数学上的多数，完全不能代表世界力量的实际的相互关系。这只不过是对各国千百万人民的意志和要求的挑战。但是，倾心于其侵略目的的美国统治集团，却利用了这个“投票机器”从事有步骤的损害联合国组织。
    随着侵略性的北大西洋集团的建立，美国统治集团开始愈益使自己跟全世界对立起来，愈益顽强地充任反和平的阴谋家。北大西洋集团就是埋在联合国下面的一枚地雷。因此，当北大西洋集团已成事实之后，美国阴谋家们对损害联合国的努力，就带有更加强固和激烈的性质了。
    由此可见，尽管美国统治集团虚伪地说他们对于联合国抱着“赞助的态度”；他们实际上是它的敌人，他们阴谋破坏它。同时，由此可见，在各国人民保卫和平运动的巨大高潮之中发挥正常和有效作用的联合国，在杜鲁门和艾奇逊之流看来是特别不能接受的。要不是害怕激起全世界千百万人民猛烈抗议的话，美国反和平的阴谋家们，早就直截了当地提出取消联合国的问题了。
    然而，美国统治集团虽然实际上进行从内部瓦解和破坏联合国的工作，但是他们考虑到保卫和平运动的空前规模，为了安慰政治上近视的人们，常常散布关于联合国的有益和需要的虚伪诈辩。
    人民是欺骗不了的，他们有健康的感觉和雪亮的眼睛。他们不相信那些花言巧语，而有自己的见解，自己的基于真正事实的判断。一切事实都彻底揭露了反和平的美国的阴谋家们。
    全世界各国人民全心全意地欢迎苏联对于巩固和平与国际安全所作的伟大贡献，他们坚定地认识苏联是和平与各国间友谊的可靠的堡垒。认识苏联是为一切爱好和平的人民的切身利益而进行斗争的。（君强节译自六月二十四日真理报）
