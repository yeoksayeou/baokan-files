Cultivating and Educating the New Generation
	Feng Wenbin

	This is a portion of Comrade Feng Wenbin's speech at the First National Conference of Cadres for Children's Work, convened by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in late April this year. This speech offers clear criticisms of certain deviations occurring in current children's education work and points out the correct direction for New Democratic national education. This is a document of significant guiding importance. Therefore, we are publishing it.
	——Editor

	In this recent period, our work in cultivating and educating the new generation has achieved results. Whether in the old liberated areas or the newly liberated areas, in children's work, new knowledge education has been carried out, and the ideological progress of the children has been promoted. There have also been some reforms in curriculum and school system, and there have been new creations in some schools in the Northeast. Since the establishment of the Young Pioneers, many teachers have actively and proactively assisted in the work of the organization, enabling it to play a significant role in school teaching.

	However, there are still deviations in the work. One is to underestimate the work of teachers, believing that teaching is unpromising, failing to recognize that cultivating and educating the new generation is an arduous task and a glorious responsibility, and adopting a perfunctory attitude. The other is to adopt inappropriately heavy and abstract political content for the education of children, and to carry it out in a formalistic and newly coercive manner. This greatly damages the health and lively nature of the children and hinders their free growth and normal development. The reasons for this deviation are: (1) the old educational system and methods have not been thoroughly reformed; (2) the set of practices for ideological remolding in short-term cadre training classes in the liberated areas during the war period have been mechanically applied to long-term education in primary schools and to children. Therefore, some progressive education workers, although full of enthusiasm for doing a good job, lack new methods and experience and do not know how to correctly cultivate and educate children.

Correctly Conduct Political and Ideological Education

	The purpose of our education is to cultivate the new generation into future masters of the new society, excellent sons and daughters of the new China, with correct ideology and revolutionary temperament, a foundation of cultural and scientific knowledge, and a healthy physique, that is, complete in moral, intellectual, and physical development. Therefore, we must implement a correct and appropriate political and ideological education for the new generation, starting from childhood. It is wrong to think that it is unnecessary to carry out political and ideological education for children, and it is not in line with the New Democratic education policy, which we oppose. But at the same time, we also oppose divorcing ourselves from the reality of children, using political content for adults and the elderly, and treating children with abstract political clichés.

	Some teachers do not conduct concrete, lively, simple, and clear political and ideological education based on the characteristics, psychology, hobbies, and acceptance level of the children, but instead force the children to memorize a large pile of empty political slogans and political terms by rote, which they cannot digest at all. Some primary schools give作文 topics to students around the age of ten such as: "On the Current Tasks of the Women's Movement" and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party." Excessive criticism and struggle have been quite commonly adopted. In some schools, teachers lead students to turn class meetings into ideological struggle sessions. For example, in one school, at a criticism meeting, a child said: "I have many mistakes, but I don't know what my mistakes are? Please criticize me." Everyone then said: "Not knowing is a mistake." Then one person said one sentence, and another said another, and soon he was made to cry. Other children then said: "Crying is also a mistake." The teacher's so-called enlightenment actually becomes interrogation and trial, forcing the children being struggled against to admit some mistakes that they do not even understand the meaning of. For example, a child who likes to ask questions is said to be deliberately trying to make things difficult for the teacher, and finally given a big label of "individual heroism." Criticism is often nitpicking, making something out of nothing, inferring something very serious from some occasional small things. For example, some girls who do not like to play with boys often are criticized for "having boundaries between men and women, and feudal consciousness." Two children who are often together are criticized for being a "small circle." Children who jump and hop are "not abiding by school rules." Children who are not lively are "not connecting with the masses" or "have ideological problems." Even one child was criticized for having "narrow nationalism" because he had a fight with a Hui child. In this way, asking primary school students to criticize and examine themselves in group meetings and large meetings, making them feel embarrassed and not knowing what is right. This has dampened the children's spirit.

	Another is the so-called "democratic management" and "mass line." The students' conduct is subject to "democratic appraisal" by the students themselves and passed by vote: how many advantages, how many disadvantages. Some schools have a class that stipulates that five good and bad students must be elected every month, which often makes the children who are elected as bad students cry and be unhappy for a long time. Teachers also specially "cultivate" a group of so-called "small cadres" from among the students to "manage" the students. Some teachers even hand over test papers and exercises to the "small cadres" for grading. This is actually the teacher "abandoning responsibility."

	The above-mentioned erroneous practices will inevitably seriously damage the physical and mental health and ideological liveliness of the children, as well as their active and courageous spirit. We must relieve this inappropriate heavy burden.

Correctly Carry Out Collectivist Education

	Collectivist education is an important part of political and ideological education. Our revolution is a heroic cause of collectivism. We must cultivate the new generation with the spirit of collectivism. There are now two deviations: one is that it is considered unnecessary or even opposed to carry out collectivist education, which is wrong; the other is formal "collectivism," going to another extreme of "collectivism," which is also incorrect.

	Correct collectivism, in schools, is to implement the New Democratic national education policy, to study for a common goal—the great cause of building a new China—and to work hard to learn the lessons well. Now some schools emphasize formal collectivism, arranging students into groups, where living, learning, and playing must be together, and everything must be discussed by everyone, even having students discuss "how many square feet are in an acre?" before teaching the lesson. Some places also average scores in an egalitarian way. Some even "collectivize" to the extent that students end up defecating in their pants. This hinders correct educational work. It also keeps teachers busy, leaving them without time to study and improve their professional skills, so that teaching cannot achieve better results. If this incorrect "collectivist education" hinders everyone's learning, hinders the excellent academic achievements of individuals, then it precisely hinders the interests of the collective, hinders the cultivation of the new generation in the new China. Collectivism should never hinder the development of individuality in a common goal and common life. We cannot demand that children be educated into one type, as if they were printed from the same mold. Individuality in a common cause and common life is consistent with revolutionary collectivism. Only by paying good attention to and understanding the characteristics, personalities, and interests of children, and developing their correct aspects, can correct collectivist education be carried out. At the same time, correct collectivism must be built on the basis of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship. Children must be made aware of the common tasks they are undertaking, the consistency of their interests, and that they will dedicate themselves to the same goal and common revolutionary cause; to make them care for each other, help each other, have consistent actions, work hard for the whole, and cultivate in them the spirit of "everyone for me, me for everyone."

How to Cultivate and Educate Children

	Then, how exactly should we cultivate and educate children? Someone asked: Should we manage children at all? Do we need discipline and punishment? The question cannot be posed this way. Of course, children must be managed. But the meaning of "manage" is not to "watch" them and "not allow them to move"; nor is it to divide them into two types: one is to manage others, and the other is to be managed. What we mean by "manage" is to care for them, enlighten them, and lead them, not to let them go their own way. Discipline and punishment are also necessary, the question is how to use them correctly.

	The most important thing in cultivating and educating children is to be good at enlightening their self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-love. Discipline must also be established on the basis of conscious automation, and not on the basis of fear. Therefore, we must first be familiar with the characteristics and personality of children, and cultivate their revolutionary self-esteem and active enterprising spirit. Methods such as electing bad students and punishing them with three days of suspension for talking back to the teacher will cause abnormal resentment and bad consequences. Second, we must focus on persuasion and use concrete examples to educate them. For example, educating them with children's movies, revolutionary history stories, the lives of revolutionary leaders, and good examples of children. In this way, we can cultivate children's conscious discipline and good habits from a positive aspect. Finally, when we have to use punishment, it is only used as an educational method, and not as retribution for offenses and simple punishment. The purpose should be to inspire self-awareness, self-esteem, and courage to correct mistakes, and not to cause permanent trauma and feelings of inferiority, fear, and disappointment.

The Responsibility of Teachers

	Finally, what do teachers rely on to establish their prestige? We believe that the central issue is to teach the lessons well. According to what we have learned from Beijing: teachers who teach well, whose content is rich and correct, lively, and easy to understand, have good order in the classroom, students listen attentively, and the teacher's prestige is also high. The poor order in the classroom, the students making faces and not listening carefully during class, is mostly the result of the teacher's teaching method or content being poor and not meeting the students' requirements. At present, many teachers are undergoing ideological remolding and have made great progress, which is good and necessary. But we believe that we must combine ideological remolding with improving professional skills and teaching the lessons well, and not divide them into two distinct stages. Second, to establish prestige, teachers must understand the psychology, interests, and characteristics of children, care for them, and guide them to the right path. Teachers should not use insulting and threatening methods to make children afraid of teachers; but they cannot condone errors without criticism and education in order to win the children's favor. These methods cannot correctly establish the teacher's prestige. Third, be a model of virtue. Teachers should pay attention to making their every move a moral model and behavioral example for children, so that they can become a good example for them to learn from. Being able to do the above three points will certainly be able to become a good teacher respected and loved by the children.

### 培养教育新的一代

　　培养教育新的一代
    冯文彬
    这是中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在今年四月下旬召开的全国第一次少年儿童工作干部大会上冯文彬同志讲话的一部分。这篇讲话，对于目前少年儿童教育工作中所发生的某些偏向，提出了明确的批评，指出了新民主主义的国民教育的正确方向。这是一个具有重要的指导意义的文件。因此我们把它发表出来。
                                    ——编者
    在最近这个时期内，我们培养教育新的一代的工作是有成绩的。无论在老解放区和新解放的地区，在少年儿童工作上，进行了新知识的教育，推动了小朋友们思想的进步。在课程学制方面也有某些改革，东北某些学校中还有了新的创造。自少年儿童队建立以来，许多教师主动地积极地帮助队的工作，使队的工作在学校教学中发挥了很大的作用。
    但，工作中还存在着偏向。一种是轻视教师的工作，认为教师工作没有出息，不认识培养教育新的一代是一个艰巨的任务，光荣的责任，而采取敷衍塞责的态度。另一种是对少年儿童的教育，采取了不适当的过重的抽象的政治内容，并以形式主义与新的强迫命令的方式来进行。因而大大损害了少年儿童们的健康和活泼的天性，妨碍了少年儿童自由的成长和正常的发展。产生这种偏向的原因是：（一）旧的教育制度与方法没有彻底改造；（二）把战争时期解放区办短期干部训练班中改造思想的一套做法，机械地搬用到长期教育的小学校里和少年儿童中来。因此，有一部分进步的教育工作者虽有搞好工作的满腔热忱，但是缺乏新的方法和经验，不懂得如何正确地来培养教育少年儿童。
    正确进行政治思想教育
    我们教育的目的是要把新的一代培养成为具有正确的思想意识与革命的气质、具有文化科学的基础知识和健康的体魄，即德智体兼全的新社会未来的主人，新中国优秀的儿女。因此，我们对于新的一代，必须从少年儿童的时代起，贯彻一种正确和适当的政治思想教育。认为对于少年儿童不必进行政治思想教育是错误的，是不合乎新民主主义的教育方针的，是我们所反对的。但同时我们也反对那种脱离少年儿童的实际，用对待成年人老年人的政治内容，以抽象的政治八股的方法来对待少年儿童。
    有些教师们不是根据儿童们的特点、心理、爱好与其接受程度，进行具体生动、浅显、明确的政治思想教育，而将一大堆空洞的政治口号和政治名词，叫儿童们囫囵吞枣地死记硬背，根本消化不了。有的小学校给十岁左右的小学生出的作文题目是：《论当前妇女运动的任务》，《中国革命与中国共产党》。相当普遍地采取过火的批评和斗争。有些学校，教师领导着学生，把班会开成思想斗争会。例如，有一个学校在一次批评会上，一个儿童说：“我有很多错误，但我不知道我的错误是什么？请大家批评吧。”大家便说：“不知道就是错误。”于是你一句他一句，不久弄得他哭了。别的儿童便说：“哭也是错误。”教师的所谓启发，实际上变成质问和审判，逼着被斗争的儿童，承认一些自己也不懂得是什么意思的错误。如对一个爱发问的儿童，硬说他是故意要与教师为难，最后给他按上一个“个人英雄主义”的大帽子。批评往往是吹毛求疵，无中生有，把一些偶然的小事，推断得非常严重。如有些女孩子不爱常与男孩子一起玩，就要被批评为“男女有界限，封建意识”。两个小孩子常在一起，又要被批评为“小圈子”。跳跳蹦蹦的孩子是“不守校规”。不活泼孩子又是“不联系群众”或“思想有问题”。甚至有个小孩子因为与回族孩子打了架，教师就批评他有“狭隘民族主义思想”。这样，要小学生在小组会、大会上，批评检讨，检讨批评，弄得左右为难，到底不知怎样才对。这就打击了儿童的锐气。
    再有一种是所谓“民主管理”、“群众路线”。学生的品行，要学生自己举行“民主鉴定”，表决通过：几条优点，几条缺点。有的学校有一个班规定每月都要选举好坏学生各五名，而常使被选为坏学生的儿童啼哭和长期不愉快。教师并且专门从学生中“培养”一批所谓“小干部”来“管理”学生。有的教师甚至把试卷、习题都交给“小干部”去评阅。这实际上是教师“放弃责任”。
    以上那种错误的做法，将不免要严重地损害少年儿童们身心的健康和思想的活泼，以及积极勇敢的精神。我们必须解除这种不适当的沉重的负担。
    正确的进行集体主义教育
    集体主义教育是政治思想教育的重要一环。我们的革命就是集体主义的英雄事业。我们必须以集体主义的精神来培育新的一代。现在存在着两种偏向：一是认为根本不需要甚至反对进行集体主义的教育，这是错误的；另一种是形式上的“集体”，走到了另一极端的“集体”，这也是不正确的。
    正确的集体主义，在学校里，就是贯彻新民主主义的国民教育方针，为着共同的目标——建设新中国的伟大事业而进行学习，努力把功课学好。现在有的学校里，强调形式上的集体，把学生都编成小组，生活、学习、游玩都要在一起，什么都要经过大家的讨论，甚至教课前要学生讨论“一亩等于几方尺？”也有的地方平均主义地拉平分数。有的甚至“集体”到这样的程度，逼得学生屎拉在裤子里。这样就妨碍了正确的教育工作。使教师也忙得没有时间去钻研和提高业务，教学不能得到更好的效果。如果由于这种不正确的“集体主义教育”，而妨碍了大家的学习，妨碍了个人学习的优良成绩，那就恰恰是妨碍了集体的利益，妨碍了新中国新一代的培养。集体主义决不应妨碍在共同目标、共同生活中的个性的发展。我们不能要求把少年儿童教育成一个类型，如同一个模型里印出来的一样。在共同事业和共同生活中的个性与革命的集体主义是一致的。只有很好地注意和了解少年儿童的特点、个性和兴趣，发展其正确的方面，才能进行正确的集体主义教育。同时正确的集体主义必须建筑在团结、互助和友爱的基础上。要使少年儿童认识到他们所担负的共同任务，他们的利益的一致性，他们将献身于同一的目标和共同的革命事业；使他们互相爱护，互相帮助，有一致的行动，为全体而努力，培养他们具有“人人为我，我为人人”的精神。
    如何培养教育儿童
    那末，究竟如何培养教育儿童呢？有人问：到底对于少年儿童要不要管？要不要纪律和处罚？问题不能这样提法。对于少年儿童当然要管。但所谓“管”的意义，并不是“看住”他们“不准动”的意思；也不是将他们分为两种：一种是管理别人的，一种是被人管理的。我们所说的“管”，是指要关心他们、启发他们、领导他们，不是放任自流。纪律和处罚也是要的，问题在于如何正确地使用。
    培养教育少年儿童，最主要的是要善于启发他们的自觉、自尊和自爱。纪律也必需建立在自觉自动的基础上，而不能建立在畏惧的基础上。因此，我们首先必须熟悉少年儿童的特点和性格，培养他们革命的自尊心和积极的进取心。像选举坏学生的办法，以及因为向老师回嘴而处罚停学三天等做法，都会引起不正常的反感和不良的后果。其次，要着重规劝说服，并多用具体的实例来进行教育。如以儿童电影、革命历史故事、革命领袖生平、好儿童的榜样等，来教育他们。这样可以从积极方面培养少年儿童们自觉的纪律和良好的习惯。最后在不得不用处罚的方法时，也只是作为一个教育的方法，而不能当做犯了过失的报应和单纯的惩罚。目的应在于启发自觉、自尊，勇于改过，而不要使他们造成永远的创伤，和自卑、恐惧与失望的心情。
    教师的责任
    最后，那么教师依靠什么来树立自己的威信呢？我们认为：中心问题是要教好功课。根据我们从北京市所了解：凡是教师教课好，内容丰富正确、生动活泼、简明易懂，课堂里的秩序就好，学生都用心听讲，而教师的威信也高。教室秩序不好，学生在上课时做鬼脸、不用心听，多半是教师教学的方法或内容不好，不能满足学生的要求的结果。目前许多教师在进行思想改造，获得了极大的进步，这是很好的和必要的。但我们认为必须把改造思想和提高业务水平、教好功课结合起来，不要把它们截然分成两个阶段来进行。其次，教师要树立威信，必须了解少年儿童的心理、兴趣和特点，关心他们，诱导他们向正确的道路走。教师不应当用侮辱和威吓的手段，使儿童害怕教师；但也不能对错误采取姑息容忍、不加批评教育，来博取儿童对教师的好感。这些方法，都不能正确地建立教师的威信。第三，要为人师表。教师要注意自己的一举一动都要成为少年儿童道德的表率和行为的模范，使自己成为他们学习的好榜样。能够做到以上三点，就一定能够成为一个被少年儿童们所尊敬爱戴的好教师了。
