　　Lofty Internationalist Spirit Permeates the Lines
    Chinese and Soviet Students Exchange Letters
    Over Four Hundred Reply Letters from Capital Students Have Been Forwarded to the Soviet Union
    [Our Newspaper] In June, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters received several batches of letters from Soviet students to Chinese students. Their enthusiastic congratulations on the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and their deep concern for the students and children of New China fully demonstrated a high degree of internationalism. In the capital, these letters have been forwarded to various schools by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other units. After receiving the letters, the students in various schools wrote back one after another. As of June 20, students from various schools in the capital had replied with 426 letters, which have now all been forwarded to the Soviet Union.
    In these replies, Beijing students expressed their deep gratitude for the profound friendship of Soviet students, described their recent lives in various styles, and paid high tribute to the great teacher of the Soviet people and all mankind—Stalin.
    Students of the First School for Children of Railway Workers in Beijing wrote in their reply: "Before liberation, we never corresponded with foreign friends. So when we received your letter this time, we were indescribably happy and excited. We read it slowly, word by word, and the more we read, the more interesting it became. Your enthusiasm and love make us feel extremely grateful and worthy of learning from."
    The Student Union of Yu Ying Middle School wrote to the Moscow Middle School students in the Soviet Union: "We look forward to your great motherland's capital—Moscow—with high enthusiasm. We are concerned about everything in your motherland, and even more concerned about the great teacher of all mankind—Comrade Stalin. He guides the weak and small nations to seek liberation and guides the world revolution to victory and light. His wise decisions are deeply engraved in our hearts. We are always calling out his name, loving him as much as we love our own leader—Comrade Mao Zedong."
    When writing about their life after liberation, the Student Union of the Fourth Municipal Boys' Middle School said: "Our lives are getting happier and happier every day. Chairman Mao told us: 1950 will be better than 1949, and our situation will get better year by year. We deeply believe in the instructions of the leader. We thank the wise and great leader—Chairman Mao—for his leadership, and we celebrate the birth of the glorious New China. We sincerely thank the great socialist Soviet Union and the teacher of mankind—Marshal Stalin—for their high degree of internationalism and their profound brotherly friendship, because this is inseparable from our revolutionary victory and construction success."
    All the students of the Third Class of the Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal School wrote in their reply: "The happy, beautiful, and joyful life of the socialist country has greatly encouraged our desire to actively strive for the realization of socialism. But we still lack experience in construction. 'Learn from Soviet friends' has already become a common slogan and practical action throughout the country."
    In every reply, it is fully shown that the young generation of New China loves their motherland so much and has such strong confidence in the construction of New China. At the same time, they used various words and phrases to strongly and sincerely express a common wish: Although Soviet students and Chinese students are far apart, their hearts are the same, and they both hope that all the young people in the world can be free to sing the songs they love and read the books they love. Therefore, they hope that students from China and the Soviet Union will hold hands in mutual assistance and love like brothers and sisters and strive together for the liberation of all mankind and lasting peace in the world. They further hope that Soviet students will give more guidance as elder brothers and introduce more learning experiences so that Chinese students can better learn from the Soviet Union and build New China.

　　高度国际主义精神充溢字里行间
    中苏学生互通书信 
    首都学生四百余封复信已转发苏联
    【本报讯】在六月份中，中苏友协总会曾收到几批苏联学生给中国学生的来信。他们对中国人民革命胜利的热情祝贺，对新中国学生、儿童的深刻关切，充分表现了高度的国际主义精神。这些信件，在首都方面，已经由北京市中苏友协等单位分别转交给各校。各校同学收到后，都纷纷写了回信。到六月二十日止，首都各校学生已经复信四百二十六封，现已全部转寄苏联。
    在这批回信里，北京学生对苏联学生的深厚友谊，表示了深刻的感激，用各种不同的笔调记述了自己的生活近况，并向苏联学生及人类伟大导师——斯大林致以崇高的敬礼。
    北京铁路职工子弟第一学校学生的回信里这样写着：“在没有解放以前，我们从没有和外国朋友们通过信。所以当我们接到你们这次的来信后，真是说不出的愉快和高兴。一个字、一个字慢慢地读着，越读越有味。你们的热情与友爱，真使我们感激不尽，也值得我们好好学习。”
    育英中学学生会给苏联莫斯科中学生的信里说道：“我们以高度的热忱遥望着你们伟大祖国首都——莫斯科。我们在关怀着你们祖国的一切，更关怀着全人类伟大导师——斯大林同志。他引导弱小民族求得解放，引导世界革命走向胜利，走向光明。他那英明的决策，深深地刻划在我们的心上。我们时时在高呼着他的名字，热爱着他像热爱我们自己的领袖——毛泽东同志一样。”
    市立男四中学生会在写到解放后的生活情形时说：“我们的生活一天一天地幸福起来了。毛主席告诉我们：一九五○年就要比一九四九年好，我们的情况会一年比一年地好起来。我们深深相信领袖的指示。我们感谢英明伟大的领袖——毛主席的领导，庆贺着光辉灿烂的新中国的诞生。我们衷心感谢伟大的社会主义苏联和人类的导师——斯大林大元帅的高度国际主义精神，对我们深厚兄弟友谊的帮助，因为这与我们的革命胜利和建设成功是分不开的。”
    河北省立北京师范第三班全体同学的回信里写道：“社会主义国家的美满、幸福、愉快的生活，大大地鼓励了我们积极争取社会主义实现的心情。但我们还缺乏建设的经验。“向苏联友人学习”，已经是全国普遍的一个口号和实际的行动。”
    在每封回信里，都充分显示出新中国年青的一代，是那么热爱着自己的祖国，对新中国的建设是具有那么坚强的信心。同时他们用了各种不同的词句，强烈、诚恳地表示了一个共同的意愿：苏联学生和中国学生，虽然彼此相隔很远，但是心情都是一样的，共同希望着全世界的青年都能得到自由，去唱自己爱唱的歌，读自己爱读的书。因此，希望中苏两国的学生们像兄弟一般地紧握互助友爱的手，共同为全人类的解放、世界的持久和平而努力斗争。更希望苏联学生们以老大哥的资格多多指教，多多地介绍学习的经验，以便让中国学生更好地学习苏联，来建设新中国。
