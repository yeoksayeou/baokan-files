        American Imperialism Trapped in a Mire
    The Korean civil war provoked by the American aggressors and the subsequent direct armed intervention has entered its third week. The heroic Korean People's Army has basically crushed the main force of the Lee Seung-man puppet army and inflicted heavy blows on the invading American intervention troops. As of July 9, the Korean People's Army had penetrated about 200 kilometers into southern Korea, liberating more than one-third of the vast towns and villages in South Korea. They are now continuing to advance south on all fronts, pursuing the enemy, and expanding their gains.

    The development of the Korean situation in the past half month has powerfully proved that the power of the people is invincible, and the power of imperialism is fragile and not terrible.

    The US government initially announced that US intervention in the Korean incident would be limited to supplying military materials and other so-called "economic assistance," and then announced that it would be limited to the navy and air force commanded by MacArthur. But then it sent the army to fight in Korea. The US government initially announced that the aggressive actions of the US air and naval forces and their armed forces would be limited to southern Korea. But then it ordered the air and naval forces to bombard and bomb cities north of the 38th parallel, ravaging the people of North Korea. The US government initially announced that the United States would only use "certain ground support troops" commanded by MacArthur, and stated that only a small number of armed forces could reverse the situation. But then it transferred troops from the Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Military Regions in the country to the Far East, and believed that at least three to six divisions would be needed to stop the offensive of the Korean People's Army. The US government initially announced that the United States did not need to mobilize. However, Truman issued a conscription order on July 7 to expand the armed forces; the US Department of Defense announced on the same day the "first step" to establish the "largest combat force of the Army, Navy, and Air Force," which would indefinitely increase its military spending for the invasion of Korea; MacArthur also ordered the Yoshida puppet government on the 8th to establish a so-called "National Police Reserve Force" to further arm Japan.

    These steps taken by the American aggressors, on the one hand, show that the American ruling clique is driving the United States step by step toward a larger-scale war of aggression. On the other hand, they also show that the American aggressors are encountering more and more difficulties and are deeply mired in the Korean quagmire.

    The American aggressors originally believed that the Lee Seung-man bandit gang they had raised and the puppet defense forces they had trained could serve their masters and complete the "Northern Expedition"; they originally believed that the American air fortresses, fleets, and ground forces could deter the Korean people; they originally thought that illegally stealing the name of the UN Security Council to "coerce the feudal lords in the name of the Emperor" would enable various vassal states to provide more manpower and cannon fodder. However, contrary to this, the American aggressors underestimated the strength of the Korean people and overestimated their own strength, so that their hopes were dashed. Facts have proved that puppet regimes fostered under bayonets will quickly disintegrate in the face of the revolutionary tide of the people; American-equipped reactionary armed forces are vulnerable; the American war machine cannot scare the Korean people who have waged more than 40 years of arduous struggle against the Japanese rulers; the imperialist countries have different dreams in the same bed and are busy taking care of themselves. Therefore, American aggressors have to rely mainly on themselves to fight.

    What about the combat effectiveness of the American army? Facts have proved that the morale of the US military is not much stronger than that of Lee Seung-man's puppet defense forces. Despite the cover and coordination of the US air and naval forces and the modern weapons, they were panicked in the face of the offensive of the Korean People's Army. They retreated from the front line of Seoul to Suwon, from the front line of Suwon to Pyeongtaek, and from the front line of Pyeongtaek to Cheonan. The US military fled in embarrassment all the way, abandoning the wounded, and entire batches of American soldiers were taken prisoner. American officers, including the initial so-called "American military advisory group," also showed the ugly state of being greedy for life and afraid of death. This shows that the US imperialist war of intervention in Korea is an unjust war of aggression, which is not justified and not only cannot gain the support of the American people, but even the American soldiers who have been driven to the battlefield are unwilling to sacrifice their lives for the interests of the American ruling clique.

    It can be seen that the American aggressors have already reaped the consequences of launching the war on the Korean battlefield. They themselves admit that "South Koreans hate us (referring to the US military)," but they have to carry out "a long, difficult, and costly struggle" (Associated Press) in this environment where they are surrounded by enemies on all sides. The result of this struggle will undoubtedly be a great consumption and weakening of the strength of US imperialism and even the entire imperialist camp, the ruling groups of the imperialist countries will be increasingly opposed by their own people, and the Korean people and other colonial and semi-colonial countries will achieve victory one after another, making American aggressors more passive and isolated, and making it more difficult, if not impossible, for the imperialist camp to launch a third world war.

            The Voice of Justice

    The just war of the Korean people has won the sympathy and support of the progressive mankind all over the world. A mass movement against the armed intervention of American imperialism and in support of the Korean people is rapidly unfolding around the world, thereby pushing the great movement to defend world peace further forward and to a climax.

    The 800 million people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have extended a hand of sympathetic friendship to the Korean people who are fighting heroically. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and the Polish government have respectively issued solemn statements denouncing the imperialist act of armed aggression against Korea by the US government and declaring the resolution passed by the Security Council manipulated by the United States to support the US armed intervention as illegal. The magnificent call of "No interference in Korea" and "American imperialism get out of Korea" resounded throughout the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other people's democratic countries, resounded throughout the capitalist and colonial and semi-colonial countries from Northern Europe to Australia and from the Near East to Central America, resounded in every corner of the world. This expresses the infinite anger of the vast people of the world towards the American robbers and their accomplices, and expresses their great feelings of sharing weal and woe with the heroic Korean people.

    The signature campaign to defend world peace has been further expanded and deepened due to the open armed aggression against Korea by American imperialism. The peace signature campaign has been combined with the movement against American interference in Korea. Since the Soviet Union launched the signature campaign on June 30, more than 56 million people had signed the peace declaration in the six days up to July 5. Nearly 30 million people have signed in China. The number of signatures in France has surged from 8 million in late June to more than 10 million in early July. The German Democratic Republic has 17 million signatures. Japan has more than 1.5 million signatures and is now striving to collect a maximum goal of 40 million. The signature campaign in the United States has gained more and more people's support. Until recently, the number of signatures has exceeded 500,000, of which more than 100,000 signatures were collected after Truman ordered armed intervention in Korea.

    The sympathy of the vast people of the world is on the side of the invaded Korean people, and more people around the world have poured into the ranks of peace because the ugly face of American imperialism has been completely exposed, which makes American imperialism more isolated and helpless.

    The American robber-style aggression against Korea is also fraught with difficulties due to the inconsistency within imperialism. The US government used the tool of the UN Security Council to coerce its vassal states to share more responsibility for the war of aggression, but this attempt is facing more and more difficulties. Although more than 40 countries have expressed their willingness to serve as accomplices of the United States, most of these more than 40 accomplices have only expressed "general support." For example, the governments of France, India, Denmark, and Sweden have officially announced that they are unable to provide any military assistance to South Korea. Even active accomplices such as Britain, Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, are now also lacking confidence in the war adventure and are in a difficult situation to protect themselves. In addition to sending a part of the air and naval forces to directly participate in the US armed aggression, they have also announced that they cannot send troops to directly participate in the war. This cannot but make the American aggressors actually bear the responsibility of the war alone and helplessly implement "fighting alone." The unity within the imperialist group is formal and superficial, and it will never be lasting. It will be full of flaws with stronger counterattacks or the prolongation of the war. US imperialism is a paper tiger with a strong appearance but weak inside, and all imperialism is a paper tiger with a strong appearance but weak inside, which is now more nakedly exposed to the people of the world.

        美帝国主义陷在泥淖中
    美国侵略者所挑起的朝鲜内战以及随之而来的直接武装干涉，已进入第三周。英勇的朝鲜人民军已基本上打垮了李承晚伪国防军的主力，并给予入侵的美国干涉军以沉重打击。迄七月九日为止，朝鲜人民军已深入朝鲜南部二百公里左右的地区，解放了南朝鲜三分之一以上的广大城镇和乡村。他们现正全线继续向南挺进，追歼敌人，扩大战果。
    半个多月来朝鲜形势的发展有力地证明：人民的力量是无敌的，帝国主义的力量是脆弱的，并不可怕的。
    美国政府起初宣布，美国对朝鲜事件的干涉将限于供应军用物资和其它所谓“经济援助”，继又宣布，将限于麦克阿瑟所统率的海军和空军。但是它接着就派遣陆军去朝鲜作战。美国政府起初宣布，美国的海空军及其武装部队的侵略行动，只限于朝鲜南部。但是它接着就命令海空军轰击和轰炸三八线以北的城市，蹂躏朝鲜北部的人民。美国政府起初宣布，美国仅使用麦克阿瑟所统率的“某些陆军地面支援部队”，并表示只要少数的武装部队就可以扭转战局。但是它接着就从国内第二、第三、第四和第六各军区调拨陆军，开往远东，并认为至少要有三个师到六个师的兵力，才能阻挡朝鲜人民军的攻势。美国政府起初宣布，美国没有动员的必要。但是，杜鲁门于七月七日发表了征兵令，扩充武装部队；美国防部同日公布建立“陆海空三军最大作战力量”的“第一个步骤”，将无限制地增加其侵略朝鲜的军事费用；麦克阿瑟也于八日命令吉田傀儡政府，建立所谓“国家警察后备队”，进一步武装日本。
    美国侵略者所采取的这些步骤，一方面表明美国统治集团正在一步一步地把美国驱向规模更大的侵略战争，另一方面也表明美国侵略者正遭遇到越来越多的困难，深深地陷入朝鲜的泥淖中。
    美国侵略者原来认为它所豢养的李承晚匪帮及其所训练的伪国防军，是能够为他们的主子效命，完成“北伐”的；原来认为美国的空中堡垒、舰队和陆军地面部队是能够吓退朝鲜人民的；原来认为非法盗用联合国安理会的名义“挟天子以令诸侯”，是能够使各仆从国家多出人力，供应炮灰的。然而，与此相反，美国侵略者过低估计了朝鲜人民的力量，过高估计了自己的力量，以致它的希望落了空。事实证明：枪刺下扶植起来的傀儡政权在人民革命的怒潮前是会迅速瓦解的；美式配备的反动武装是不堪一击的；美国的战争机器是吓不倒曾对日本统治者进行了四十多年艰苦斗争的朝鲜人民的；帝国主义国家内部是同床异梦，自顾不暇的。因此美国侵略者不得不主要地靠自己来打仗。
    美国军队的战斗力怎样呢？事实已经证明：美军士气的不振，比李承晚的伪国防军强不了多少。尽管美军有海空军的掩护配合，有现代化的武器配备，但在朝鲜人民军的攻势面前，他们是惊慌失措的，从汉城前线退到水原，从水原前线退到平泽，从平泽前线退到天安，美军一路狼狈逃窜，遗弃伤兵不顾，并有整批的美国士兵做了俘虏。美国军官，包括最初的所谓“美国军事顾问团”在内，也同样表现出贪生怕死，慌乱不堪的丑态。这说明美帝国主义所进行的干涉朝鲜的战争，是非正义的侵略战争，师出无名，不仅不能取得美国人民的支持，就是已被驱上战场的美国士兵，也不愿意为美国统治集团的利益送命。
    由此可见，美国侵略者已经在朝鲜战场上自食其发动战争的后果。他们自己承认“南朝鲜人都恨我们（指美军）”，却要在这个四面皆敌的环境中，进行“一个长期的、困难的和代价很高的斗争”（美联社）。而这个斗争的结果，无疑地将是美帝国主义以致整个帝国主义阵营力量的大大消耗与削弱，将是帝国主义国家的统治集团日益遭受本国人民的反对，将是朝鲜人民和其它殖民地半殖民地国家一个紧接着一个地取得胜利，使美国侵略者更陷于被动和孤立，使帝国主义阵营更难于、以致不可能发动第三次世界大战。
            正义的呼声
    朝鲜人民的正义战争，已经获得全世界进步人类的同情和支持，一个反对美帝国主义武装干涉和声援朝鲜人民的群众性运动，正在全世界迅速展开，从而将保卫世界和平的大运动，更推向前进，更推向高潮。
    苏联和人民民主国家的八万万人民，已向正在英勇战斗中的朝鲜人民，伸出了同情的友谊之手。苏联葛罗米柯副外长，我国周恩来外长，以及波兰政府，已分别发表了严正声明，痛斥美国政府武装侵略朝鲜的帝国主义行为，宣布美国操纵下的安理会所通过的支持美国武装干涉的决议为非法。“不准干涉朝鲜”、“美帝国主义滚出朝鲜去”的雄壮呼声，响彻了苏联、中国、波兰、捷克和其他人民民主国家，响彻了从北欧到澳洲、从近东到中美洲的资本主义和殖民地半殖民地各国，响彻了全世界每一个角落。这表示了全世界广大人民对美国强盗及其同谋犯的无比愤怒，表示了他们对英勇的朝鲜人民的休戚相关的伟大感情。
    保卫世界和平的签名运动，已因美帝国主义公开武装侵略朝鲜的挑战而更加扩大和深入了。和平签名运动已和反对美国干涉朝鲜的运动结合起来了。苏联自六月三十日开始发动签名运动以来，到七月五日为止的六天中，即有五千六百万以上的人民在和平宣言上签名。在中国签名的已近三千万。法国的签名数字，已从六月下旬的八百万，猛增到七月初的一千万以上。德意志民主共和国已有一千七百万人签名。日本已有一百五十多万人签名，现在正在为征集四千万的最高目标而奋斗。在美国的签名运动，已获得愈来愈多的人们的支持。到最近为止，签名人数已突破五十万，其中有十万多人的签名，是在杜鲁门下令武装干涉朝鲜以后征集的。
    全世界广大人民的同情都站在被侵略的朝鲜人民方面，全世界更多的人们已因美帝国主义侵略面目的彻底暴露而涌进和平的行列，这就使得美帝国主义更陷入众叛亲离和孤立的困境。
    美国对朝鲜的强盗式侵略，还因为帝国主义内部的不一致而困难重重。美国政府利用联合国安理会的这一工具，想胁迫它的仆从国家多分担侵略战争的责任，但这种企图已面临愈来愈多的困难。目前表示甘充美国帮凶的虽有四十多国，但在这四十多个帮凶国家中，绝大多数只表示了仅限于“一般的支持”，例如法国、印度、丹麦、瑞典等国政府，都已正式宣布无力给南朝鲜以任何军事援助。即使像英、澳、加、荷等积极帮凶者，现在也由于对战争冒险缺乏信心，加上自己也处于自身难保的困境，除了派出一部分空海军直接参加美国的武装侵略外，也纷纷宣布不能派陆军直接参战，这不能不使美国侵略者实际上单独承担战争的责任，无可奈何地实行“孤军奋斗”。帝国主义集团内部的一致是形式的、表面的，也决不能持久的，它将随着更坚强的反击或战争的延长而更破绽百出。美帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎，一切帝国主义都是外强中干的纸老虎，现在是更加赤裸裸地暴露在世界人民的面前了。
