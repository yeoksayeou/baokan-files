Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st -- Large numbers of members of the New Democratic Youth League in Northeast China are joining the Chinese Communist Party. According to incomplete statistics, in the two months of March and April alone, 19,755 League members joined the Communist Party, accounting for approximately 4.3 percent of the total number of League members in Northeast China at that time (excluding Jilin Province and Fushun City), which was 457,837. Among the Youth League members who joined the Communist Party, there are a large number of female League members. For example, in Songjiang Province, among the 5,109 League members who joined the Party in March and April, 1,466 were female League members. These Youth League members have received long-term education and training from the Party and the League and have become outstanding workers in various work posts, reaching the level of a Communist Party member. For example, Zhao Guoyou, a League member from the Shenyang Machine Factory No. 3, gloriously joined the Communist Party after setting a new record of machining a "pulley" in 50 minutes. In addition, Tong Junshan from the Shenyang Machine Factory No. 5, who set a new record of machining a "pulley" in 37 minutes, Liang Jun, China's first female tractor team captain, Tian Guiying, Wang Baohong, and Bi Guiying, China's first female train drivers, Qi Guizhi, a female lathe worker and labor model from Dalian, and Guo Yulan, a labor model from Heilongjiang Province, all joined the Chinese Communist Party because of their greatly improved ideological awareness and significant contributions in their work posts. They have become role models for hundreds of thousands of Youth League members in Northeast China to learn from.

　　东北大批青年团员
    加入中国共产党
    【新华社沈阳一日电】东北各地新民主主义青年团团员大批加入中国共产党。据不完全统计，仅今年三、四两个月中，即有一万九千七百五十五名团员加入了共产党，约为当时全东北各地（缺吉林省、抚顺市）团员总数四十五万七千八百三十七名的百分之四点三。参加了共产党的青年团员中有大批女团员。如松江省在三、四两月入党的五千一百零九名团员中，就有女团员一千四百六十六名。这些青年团员都受了党和团较长期的教育和培养，成为各种工作岗位上的优秀工作者，达到了共产党员的水平。如沈阳机器三厂的团员赵国有，在创造了五十分钟车一个“搭轮”的新纪录后，光荣地加入了共产党。此外，如沈阳机器五厂创造三十七分钟车一个“搭轮”新纪录的佟俊山，中国第一位女拖拉机队队长梁军，中国第一批火车女司机田桂英、王宝鸿、毕桂英，旅大女旋盘工劳动模范戚桂芝，黑龙江省劳动模范郭玉兰等青年团员都是由于思想觉悟大大提高，并在工作岗位上有了重大贡献而加入了中国共产党的。他们已成为东北数十万青年团员学习的榜样。
