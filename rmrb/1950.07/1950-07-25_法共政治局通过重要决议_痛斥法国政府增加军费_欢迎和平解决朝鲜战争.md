Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 22nd: Tass reports: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party passed a resolution on July 20th, denouncing the Pleven-Moch government for using anti-democratic means in an attempt to prevent the National Assembly from initiating any debate on reactionary and pro-war foreign policy issues before the recess. The government will also prevent any discussion of amendments to the financial bill, which are aimed at reducing the heavy tax burden. The government wants to increase military spending by 80 billion francs. To cope with this additional expenditure, the government is clearly intent on resorting to inflation. This will mean that the meager wage increases that the government was forced to grant will vanish before they materialize.

Regarding the situation in Korea, the Political Bureau pointed out: A nationwide movement has already begun to express deep and effective sympathy for the Korean people and to condemn the American aggressors with anger. The government's decision to send warships to participate in the war of aggression against Korea will inevitably arouse the protests of all honest French people who are already opposed to the unjust war in Vietnam. The Political Bureau welcomes the Indian government's proposal and Stalin's positive response, considering this to be an extraordinary contribution to the cause of peace and the independence of all nations. The American aggressors, by refusing to participate in joint efforts aimed at localizing and stopping the war, by opposing the participation of People's China in the work of the Security Council, and by opposing hearing the opinions of the Korean people's representatives, have exposed the aims of their imperialist policy, which is to plunge the world into a terrifying Third World War.

The resolution concludes: The Political Bureau is deeply aware of the seriousness of the international situation. Therefore, it urges all working people to spare no effort to defend peace, and seeks the signatures of all honest people on the Stockholm Appeal. The Political Bureau specifically calls on Communist Party members to assist the "Fighters for Peace and Freedom Association" and any other democratic groups in sending a large-scale, representative French delegation to the Second World Peace Congress.

　　法共政治局通过重要决议
    痛斥法国政府增加军费   
    欢迎和平解决朝鲜战争
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法国共产党政治局于七月二十日通过决议，斥责普利文——摩勒政府运用反民主的手段，企图阻止国民议会在休假之前，就有关反动和战争的外交政策的问题，开始任何辩论。政府也将阻止就财政法案的修正案，进行任何讨论，这些修正案都是以减轻繁重的赋税负担为目的的。政府想增加军费开支八百亿法郎。为了应付这项追加的开支，政府显然蓄意诉诸通货膨胀。这将意味着政府被迫应允的微不足道的工资增加，将在见诸实现之前，就化为乌有。
    关于朝鲜局势，政治局指出：全国已经展开对朝鲜人民表示深切和有效的同情并对美国侵略者表示愤怒谴责的运动。政府关于派遣军舰参加进攻朝鲜的战争的决定，必将引起一切现已反对越南非正义战争的正直的法国人的抗议。政治局欢迎印度政府的建议和斯大林的积极性的答复，认为这对于和平与各国人民独立的事业是一种非常的贡献。美国侵略者由于拒绝参加以使战争局部化并使之停止为目的的共同努力，由于反对人民中国参加安全理事会的工作，并反对听取朝鲜人民代表的意见，因而暴露了他们的帝国主义政策的目的，这种政策就是要把世界投进恐怖的第三次世界大战。
    决议最后指出：政治局深感国际局势的严重。因此，它敦促全体劳动人民为保卫和平而不惜任何努力，并且征求一切诚实的人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。政治局特别号召共产党员协助“争和平自由战士协会”以及任何其他民主团体，推派大规模的具有代表性的法国代表团，出席第二届世界拥护和平大会。
