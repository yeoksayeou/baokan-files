Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th. The second plenary session of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, lasting eight days, concluded on the 17th. The main achievements of this meeting were the discussion and unanimous adoption of Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun's report on the Land Reform Plan, the report by Jia Tuofu, Director of the Finance and Economics Committee, on current financial and economic work issues in the Northwest, and unanimous agreement on the report on ethnic work by Wang Feng, Director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee, and the military report on the Northwest by Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military Region. The meeting also approved in principle the establishment of a Land Reform Committee and a Demobilization Work Committee within the organization of the Committee.

In his report on the Land Reform Plan, Vice Chairman Xi proposed that, starting this autumn, the Northwest Region will implement land reform in a guided, orderly, and step-by-step manner in areas with sufficient preparation, including 42 counties in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, some new districts in the Yulin sub-district, the suburbs of Xi'an City, the new districts of Qingyang sub-district in Gansu Province, and Yanchi and Ningshuo counties in Ningxia Province, totaling approximately 7.31 million people. Other areas where order has not yet been fully stabilized, where the mass work base and cadre strength are insufficient, will not carry out land reform this year. The timing of implementation in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities will depend on the conscious demands of the various ethnic groups.

In his report on current financial and economic work issues in the Northwest, Director Jia Tuofu focused on presenting preliminary opinions on adjusting the current industry and commerce in the Northwest under the principle of overall planning and consideration. Currently, industry and commerce in the Northwest are in a temporary period of difficulty, in a process of transition from the old economy to the new economy, from a bad situation to a good situation. The opinions put forward by Director Jia Tuofu in his report will be specifically discussed and implemented by a series of professional meetings, including representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, and the second meeting of the Northwest Finance and Economics Committee, which will be held soon.

Based on the historical characteristics and actual conditions of the political, economic, and customs of the various ethnic groups in the Northwest, as well as the experience of ethnic work during this period, Director Wang Feng pointed out that all work must adopt different steps from those in Han areas. The religious beliefs and customs of all ethnic groups must be earnestly respected; and vigorously cultivating and promoting minority cadres should be taken as the most basic task of the people's government in the next three to five years.

In addition, the meeting also heard work reports from the Committee's subordinate departments of culture and education, supervision, civil affairs, public security, and justice, as well as the people's governments of various provinces and cities; adopted the "Northwest New Area Rural Rent Reduction Measures," the "Principles for Handling Rural Debt Disputes in the Northwest New Area," and the "Organizational Regulations of the Northwest Military and Political Committee," as well as twenty-one proposals related to ethnic affairs, land reform, military affairs, finance and economics, and culture and education; heard Vice Chairman Zhang Zhizhong's report on the international situation, and adopted a telegram protesting the crimes of US imperialism in invading our country's sovereignty and undermining peace in the Far East.

Attending the meeting were Chairman Peng Dehuai, Vice Chairmen Xi Zhongxun and Zhang Zhizhong, and forty members. In addition to 103 responsible cadres from the Committee's various departments and the people's governments of various provinces and cities, there were also 33 specially invited people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life attending. During the meeting, the members and representatives deeply discussed issues and exchanged opinions in small groups in an atmosphere of close unity, and extensively and preparedly made speeches at the general assembly, closely combining the central agenda of the general assembly with group discussions, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity, active construction of the new Northwest by representatives of all ethnic groups, all revolutionary classes, and democratic parties.

　　西北军政委员会二次会议闭幕
    通过土地改革计划等报告
    通电抗议美国侵略我国主权破坏远东和平
    【新华社西安十九日电】西北军政委员会第二次全体委员会议，历时八天，已于十七日结束。此次会议的主要收获，是讨论并一致通过了习仲勋副主席关于土地改革计划的报告、财经委员会贾拓夫主任关于目前西北财政经济工作问题的报告，并一致同意民族事务委员会汪锋主任委员的民族工作报告和西北军区张宗逊副司令员关于西北的军事报告。会议并原则上通过了在该会组织机构内设立土地改革委员会和复员工作委员会。
    习副主席在关于土地改革计划的报告中提出：西北区今年秋后，将在陕西省关中四十二县、榆林分区的部分新区、西安市郊区、甘肃省庆阳分区的新区和宁夏省盐池、宁朔两县等共约七百三十一万人口的地区，在已有充分准备的条件下，有领导、有秩序、有步骤地实行土地改革。其他地方秩序尚未完全安定的地区，群众工作基础和干部力量尚不充足，今年都不进行土地改革。少数民族居住地区何时进行，要看各族人民的自觉要求如何而定。
    贾拓夫主任在关于目前西北财经工作问题的报告中，着重提出了在统筹兼顾的方针下调整目前西北工商业的初步意见。目前西北工商业是处于暂时的困难中，处于由旧经济向新经济、由坏情况向好情况的转变过程中。贾拓夫主任在报告中所提出的意见，将由最近就要举行的包括工商界代表在内的一系列的专业会议和西北财政经济委员会第二次会议具体讨论执行。
    汪锋主任委员根据西北各族人民政治、经济、风俗习惯等方面的历史特点和实际情况以及这一时期的民族工作经验，指出一切工作必须采取与汉族地区不同的工作步骤。对各族人民的宗教信仰、风俗习惯，必须认真尊重；并把大力培养和提拔少数民族干部，作为人民政府最近三、五年内最基本的任务。
    此外，会议并听取了该会所属文教、监察、民政、公安、司法等部门及各省、市人民政府的工作报告；通过了“西北新区农村减租办法”、《西北新区农村债务纠纷处理原则》和《西北军政委员会组织条例》以及有关民族、土地改革、军事、财经、文教等工作的二十一件提案；听取了张治中副主席关于国际情况的报告，通过了抗议美帝国主义侵略我国主权、破坏远东和平罪行的电文。
    出席此次会议的，有彭德怀主席、习仲勋、张治中副主席和委员四十人。列席的除该会各部门及各省、市人民政府负责干部一百零三人外，并有特邀的各族各界人士三十三人。会议中各委员和代表在亲密团结的气氛中，在小组内深入讨论问题，交换意见，并广泛地有准备地进行大会发言，使大会中心议程与小组讨论密切结合起来，充分表现了各民族、各革命阶级和民主党派代表人物团结一致，积极建设新西北的精神。
