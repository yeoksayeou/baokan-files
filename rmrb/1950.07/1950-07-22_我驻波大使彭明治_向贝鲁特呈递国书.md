Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 21st: General Peng Mingzhi, our first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Polish Republic, presented his credentials to the President of the Polish Republic, Beirut, on the 20th, accompanied by Yang Qiliang, Second Secretary of our Embassy, Yu Zhan, First Secretary, and Lieutenant Colonel Lin Fang, Deputy Military Attaché. On the Polish side, those attending the ceremony included Dr. Skrzeszewski, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Wilbromski, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

　　In his speech when presenting the credentials, Ambassador Peng said to President Beirut: "On behalf of the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people, I extend my sincere respects to President Beirut and the great Polish people. At the same time, I sincerely congratulate the Polish people for their liberation with the direct support of the heroic Soviet army, for their victory in the struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries, and for the great achievements they have made in economic and cultural construction since the establishment of a people's democratic state. The birth of the People's Republic of China has opened a new era in the friendly relations between China and Poland. I firmly believe that the smooth progress of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Polish Republic will greatly contribute not only to the solidarity and cooperation between our two peoples and to the development of our economies and cultures, but also to the consolidation of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

　　In his reply, President Beirut said: "I firmly believe that the commencement of the duties of the diplomatic representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Polish Republic will greatly contribute to deepening the friendly ties between the peoples of China and Poland and to carrying out effective cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields. As Ambassador Peng pointed out, the cooperation between our two peoples, who have freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, will greatly strengthen the peace camp headed by our common ally, the Soviet Union. The Polish people have been watching the Chinese people's war of liberation and the steadfast and unyielding work that the Chinese people are carrying out in rebuilding their country, which has been devastated by imperialism. Please convey to the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people my heartfelt blessings, wishing the Chinese people further success in their progress."

　　After the presentation of credentials, President Beirut received Ambassador Peng Mingzhi for a cordial conversation lasting one hour.

　　Ambassador Peng and the staff of our embassy in Poland arrived in Warsaw on the 17th by special train sent by the Polish government to greet them at the border. On the 18th, Ambassador Peng called on Dr. Skrzeszewski, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, and presented Chairman Mao Zedong's congratulatory letter to President Beirut and Premier Zhou Enlai's congratulatory letter to Premier Cyrankiewicz, as well as gifts celebrating Poland's National Day on July 22.
