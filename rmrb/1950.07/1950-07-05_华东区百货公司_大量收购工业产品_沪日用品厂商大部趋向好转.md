    Massively Purchases Industrial Products
    Most Shanghai Daily-Use Goods Manufacturers Trending Towards Improvement
    [Shanghai News] Jiefang Daily News: The East China Department Store has further improved its past methods of purchasing, commissioned processing, and ordering, and is actively supporting private enterprises according to plan. In May, the value of finished products purchased from private factories totaled over 80 billion yuan.

    The company's procurement value in April exceeded 58 billion yuan, more than double that of March. By May, the total value of goods purchased increased to 104.7 billion yuan, of which 86.3 billion yuan was purchased from private manufacturers, more than triple that of March. In the first half of June, the funds invested in procurement and distribution reached 35.8 billion yuan, already exceeding the total value for the entire month of March.

    In May, the number of Shanghai manufacturers benefiting from product purchases increased from 502 in April to 919, accounting for more than 80 percent of the city's daily-use goods manufacturers. According to preliminary investigations, after state-owned department stores' procurement and ordering in April and May, the resumption of work in department store manufacturers gradually increased. In the shirt industry, of the 40 manufacturers, only 5 were open before the purchases, but now all have resumed work, and generally large factories can obtain considerable profits. More than 200 stationery factories have opened, accounting for more than 60 percent of the industry. Eleven enamelware factories have opened, accounting for 70 percent of the industry. Ninety-eight towel and blanket factories have opened, and the amount of towels purchased has reached more than one-quarter of the output. Other industries such as rubber, knitwear, underwear weaving, and insulated containers have also begun to see a turnaround.

    【上海讯】解放日报消息：华东区百货公司进一步改进了过去收购、委托加工、订货的方式，积极按照计划扶助私营企业，五月份收购私营工厂成品计值八百余亿元。
    该公司四月份收购货物值五百八十亿元以上，较三月份增加一倍多。到五月份进货总值则增达一千零四十七亿元，其中从私营厂商收购的即达八百六十三亿元，较三月份增加两倍以上。六月上半月因进货投放的资金又达三百五十八亿元，已经超过三月份全月的总值。
    五月份，受收购产品的上海厂商已从四月份的五百零二家增至九百一十九家，已达全市日用品厂商的百分之八十以上。据初步调查，经过国营百货公司四、五月份收购订货后，百货厂商复工逐渐增加：衬衫业四十家，在未收购前开者仅五家，现已全部复工，一般大型厂且可获得相当利润。文具工厂已有二百多家开工，占全业百分之六十以上。搪瓷业已有十一家开工，占全业百分之七十。毛巾被毯业已开工九十八家，收购毛巾量达到产量的四分之一以上。其他橡胶、针织、内衣织造、保暖容器等业都已开始有了转机。
