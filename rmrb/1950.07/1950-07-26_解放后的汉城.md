　　The Liberated Seoul
　　By Li Donggui, Korea

　　Our republic's capital, Seoul, was liberated in a very short time thanks to the heroic advance of the People's Army.
　　This was something that the sycophants of Syngman Rhee never dreamed of. It was also something that the American imperialists, who attempted to invade the northern half and strengthened their arms in various ways, did not expect.
　　The puppet government's military commandos in the southern half, who only knew how to deceive the people with hypocrisy and fabrications, continued to falsely report that Haeju had been occupied and that Uijeongbu had been recaptured even when our People's Army broke into a corner of Seoul. Unexpectedly, such false propaganda yielded good results for our side. First, it spared the people from a state of chaos caused by seeking refuge; second, the buildings and facilities were undamaged and fell entirely into our hands. The most fortunate thing is that the patriots imprisoned in the two prisons of Seodaemun and Mapo were not massacred, but were all rescued from prison. However, when the gang began to invade the northern half, they massacred the patriots imprisoned in the army prison and buried them all in one pit.
　　When the gang fled, they blew up the pedestrian and railway bridges over the Han River. Initially, the heads of the puppet government had moved to Daejeon, but most of them, deceived by their own military leadership, remained in Seoul, and they only began to flee when our People's Army broke into Seoul. The panicked gang flocked to the Han River, hoping to cross the river and escape. The gang members, who usually had four or five concubines surrounding them, now found their concubines a burden, crying and clinging to them. At that time, crowds of people and cars were packed together on the bridge. At this moment, the puppet army's leadership, in order to prevent the pursuit of our People's Army, pressed the prepared explosives regardless of everything. With a loud bang, most of the treacherous villains and reactionaries on the bridge were either blown to death or drowned in the Han River. A representative of the United Nations who arrived later swam across the Han River because the bridge had been blown up.
　　Seoul was liberated without much damage, and the citizens were freed from the oppression and massacre of the Syngman Rhee traitors. They embraced the warm people's regime with gratitude and joy.
　　With the exception of a small handful of extremely evil reactionary remnants, all citizens, whether entrepreneurs or merchants, sincerely welcomed the people's regime. The Syngman Rhee gang not only suppressed and massacred patriots, but also lost trust in and felt resentment towards the very class that served as their stepping stones. The politics of the Syngman Rhee puppet government were simply not politics at all, but were entirely aimed at theft and plunder. Not to mention the police and judicial organs, even those serving in general agencies used every opportunity to intimidate and threaten the people in order to embezzle and accept bribes, and even the licentious poet Mao Yunshu made a fortune and became a rich woman. This was not accidental. When they reached the point of final destruction, the bandits sold the white rice they had bought from farmers for only 700 won per straw bag for 1,300 won. The acts of robbery and plunder committed by the bandits to satisfy their selfish desires far exceeded our imagination, and it is clear from conversations with people from all walks of life how much hatred and resentment the citizens felt towards them.
　　The Syngman Rhee gang's reverse propaganda and slander against the northern half was extremely vicious. The bandits used all means, including publications, literature, films, and comics, to frantically fabricate baseless facts in order to agitate the South Korean people.
　　In particular, the reverse propaganda against the People's Army was even more absurd. The bandits fabricated that "the People's Army digs out eyes and cuts off tongues." They also fabricated a film called "The Real Situation in North Korea," which fabricated scenes of the People's Army invading the homes of ordinary people, young women hiding in jars in fear, and the People's Army immediately shooting into the jars with guns after discovering them, making malicious and false propaganda.
　　However, such desperate propaganda by the bandits was overturned as soon as the People's Army entered the city. At first, some citizens who had been deceived by such evil propaganda were afraid of the People's Army and dared not approach them. However, they personally witnessed the actual actions of the People's Army, that while the People's Army was extremely strict with the reactionary groups and enemies, they were kind to the people, and cherished the people with warm sincerity like close friends.
　　They not only admired the People's Army's outstanding fighting power and courage, but were also amazed by the People's Army's kindness and high level of education.
　　The People's Army immediately conducted detailed explanations to the citizens of Seoul, dispelling the evil propaganda with which they had been infected by Syngman Rhee and various doubts about the northern half.
　　In the streets and alleys, young soldiers of the People's Army, holding guns and giving explanations, were surrounded by women carrying children, old people, and young children, all listening to the explanations with smiles and enthusiasm. In every corner, there were scenes of the People's Army giving kind explanations about the northern half to the people in this way. The citizens' love and trust for the People's Army was absolute.
　　The Seoul Temporary People's Committee immediately began work after the liberation of Seoul, and even the districts and streets restored and organized people's committees, beginning their own work. Peaceful Republic internal affairs personnel wearing green-rimmed hats were sent to the Internal Affairs Bureau and police stations to protect public security. Peeking into the police stations in each street, one could see the posture of the people and the internal affairs officers talking and laughing freely. The appearance of loving internal affairs officers in the seats of the police, who had been like evil ghosts who caused suffering and pain to the people, gave the citizens a feeling of a miracle.
　　The national flag of the republic was flying in every household, and slogans such as "Long Live General Kim Il-sung" and "Long Live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" were posted in the streets and alleys.
　　Seoul thus easily ensured public security and stabilized order. There was not a trace of dissatisfaction on the faces of every citizen.
　　The once oppressed political parties, social groups, and cultural groups re-hung their signs and began activities, holding rallies everywhere every day to sweep away the remnants of Syngman Rhee and shouting to expel American imperialism, and constantly holding parades and demonstrations in the main streets.
　　The most gratifying scene in the liberated Seoul recently is that young people are rushing to volunteer to join the volunteer army.
　　In workshops, schools, and streets, many young people volunteered to join the volunteer army, and even the students of a certain university all volunteered to join the volunteer army. In the workshops, women who volunteered to participate also accounted for the majority. Their faces were very bright, wearing green caps and green volunteer army uniforms, and participating in the volunteer army with energetic steps. Their posture looked very lively. The rallies for joining the volunteer army were all boiling with vigor and gratitude. I participated in the street democratic patriotic youth alliance rally held at the Myeongdong Theater. This was a passionate rally of pure young people, a rally of roars and cheers. Seven or eight young people took the stage to shout slogans, and all the people gathered raised their fists and responded in unison, shouting "Join the volunteer army! Join the volunteer army!" In this period today, this is the only slogan of the young people in Seoul.
　　In the theaters, films such as "My Hometown," "Gem Flower," "Meeting on the Elbe," and "Fall of Berlin" are shown, which are praised by students and citizens in general. Before the opening time, I heard female students singing "Song of General Kim Il-sung" in chorus.
　　Because of the cultural work team sent from the northern half, various songs from the northern half quickly spread. In the streets and gathering places, we can hear "Song of General Kim Il-sung" everywhere. Seeing the flag of the republic flying in the air and hearing "Song of General Kim Il-sung" in the southern half, where the Syngman Rhee traitors once ran rampant, is infinitely gratifying. Speaking of the posture of the liberated Seoul, its general situation is like this. But this is only a very abstract description.
　　Once asked a citizen of Seoul about his feelings after liberation, he replied: "Now I can live a good life with peace of mind." This simple sentence can represent the feelings of all citizens.

　　解放后的汉城
    朝鲜  李东圭
    我共和国首都汉城，由于英勇的人民军进击，在极短时日内即告解放。
    这是李承晚党徒作梦亦未想到的事情。这并且是妄图进犯北半部，以各种方法强化他们武装的美帝国主义者也没有料及的。
    只知以虚伪和捏造，欺骗人民的南半部傀儡政府军事指挥部匪帮，甚至于当我人民军突入汉城市一角的时候，还继续虚伪报道海州已被占领，已夺还议政府。不想这样虚伪宣传反给了我方好的结果。第一免去人民避难而呈混乱状态；第二建筑物和设施未遭破坏，整个落到我们手里。最庆幸的是，在西大门和麻浦两个监狱被囚禁的爱国者未遭虐杀，悉数被援救出狱的事实。但是在匪帮们向北半部开始进犯当时，虐杀在陆军监狱囚禁的爱国者以后，均埋在一个坑里。
    匪帮临逃时，炸毁了汉江的人道桥和铁桥。首先是傀儡政府首脑部已移转大田，但还有大部分被自己军事指导部欺骗仍留在汉城，当我人民军突入汉城的时候，他们才开始逃走。惊慌的匪帮群趋汉江，希图渡江逃命。平素都是四、五个娇妻爱妾左拥右抱的匪帮，这时妻妾反成了累坠，叫哭连天的紧追不舍。当时大桥上，成群的人和猬集的汽车拥成一团。正在这时，傀儡军指导部，为阻止我人民军的追击，便不顾一切将已准备好的炸药一按电机，只听轰隆一声，满桥逆徒和反动派被炸死的、淹死的大部分都牺牲在汉江里。事后赶到的联合国某一代表，因桥已被炸，他便游泳浮过汉江。
    汉城市未经怎样破坏便告解放，市民从此脱离李承晚逆徒抑压和虐杀的统治，莫不以感激和欢喜的心情投到温暖的人民政权怀抱中。
    除了不够一小撮极恶的反动残匪外，全体市民无论是企业家或商人莫不真挚的欢迎人民政权。李承晚匪帮不仅镇压并屠杀爱国人士，而且连对能够作为自己脚板的阶层，也失掉了信任而对之反感。李承晚傀儡政府所搞的政治简直不是政治，完全是以盗贼和掠夺为目的。不用说警察和司法机关，即在一般机关服务的人，把一切机会利用到恐吓人民威胁人民借以贪污受贿，甚至淫荡的诗人——毛允淑亦大发其财而成富婆了。这不是偶然的事。到了最后灭亡地步时，匪徒们把由农民以每草包只给七百元收购的白米，竟拍卖一千三百元。匪徒们为充饱私欲，所作的强盗与掠夺行为远出我们想像以上，偶然和各阶层人民谈话中也可以显然的明白，市民对他们是充满了怎样憎恶与反感。
    李承晚匪帮对北半部的逆宣传与诽谤是极为恶劣的，匪徒们用尽刊物、文艺、影片以及漫画等一切手段，疯狂的捏造出毫无根据的事实，用以鼓动南朝鲜人民。
    特别是对人民军的逆宣传更为荒唐，匪徒们捏造说：“人民军是挖眼睛割舌头的”。并且捏造出“北韩实情”的影片，其中捏造了人民军侵入老百姓家，年青女人害怕躲进缸内，但人民军队发现后立刻拿枪扫射缸内女人的场面，作恶意虚伪的宣传。
    但是匪徒们这样垂死挣扎的恶宣传，自人民军队一进城就给推翻了。起初，由于这样恶宣传而被欺骗的一部分市民，对人民军感到恐惧不敢接近人民军。然而他们亲自看到了人民军的实际行动，即人民军虽然对反动集团和敌人是严厉无比的，但对人民是亲切的，就像挚友似的拿出温暖的真情来爱护人民。
    他们不仅是佩服人民军卓越的战斗力量和勇敢性，而且对人民军的亲切性和高度的教养也非常的惊叹。
    人民军立即向汉城市民进行详细解释，破除了关于它们曾被李承晚所熏染的恶宣传和对北半部的各种疑惑。
    在各街巷，持枪而作解释工作的年青的人民军周围，拥挤着背着小孩的妇女、老人、幼童，他们都含着微笑热心静听解说。在每个角落，均有人民军像这样的和人民和蔼的讲解北半部事情的光景。市民对人民军队的爱戴与信赖是绝对性的。
    汉城市临时人民委员会，当汉城解放后立即开始工作，甚至区、街亦恢复和组织了人民委员会，开始自己的工作。在内务署与派出所，均分别派往戴着绿边帽子的和平的共和国内务人员，保护治安。经过各街派出所向里边窥望时，能够看见人民和内务署员谈笑自若的姿态。在如同恶鬼般的使人民遭殃给予痛苦的警察座位上，出现了慈爱的内务署员，使市民感觉是一种奇迹。
    每户都飘扬着共和国国旗，各街巷都贴着“金日成将军万岁”、“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁”等标语。
    汉城市是这样简易的确保了治安，安定了秩序。每一市民的面孔上，一点也没有带着不满的气色。
    曾经是受压迫的各政党、社会团体、文化团体，都再度挂上牌子开始活动，每天到处召开扫荡李承晚残匪与高呼驱逐美帝国主义者的奋起大会，在各大街不断举行游行示威。
    已解放的汉城，近日最使人感激的风光，是青年们纷纷争先志愿参加义勇军的事情。
    在车间、学校、街头，许多的青年均自愿参加义勇军，甚至某大学的学生是全体自愿参加义勇军的。在各车间中，自愿参加的妇女亦占多数。他们的脸上是很明朗的，戴着绿色制帽，穿着绿色的义勇军制服，以生气勃勃的步调，参加义勇军队伍，看来他们的姿态是很活泼的。参加义勇军的奋起大会莫不沸腾着朝气和感激的气氛。我参加了在明东剧场召开的街头民主爱国青年同盟奋起大会。这是纯朴青年们热情洋溢的大会，是怒吼和欢呼的大会。七、八名青年登台喊口号，所有集会的人，举起拳头群起响应，一起高呼“参加义勇军！参加义勇军！”今天这个时期，这就是汉城市青年们的唯一口号。
    在各剧场，放映《我的故乡》、《宝石花》、《易北河的会师》、《柏林陷落》等影片，受到一般学生、市民的称赞。在开演时间前，我听到女学生们合唱《金日成将军之歌》。
    因北半部派往的文化工作队，北半部各种歌曲很快的传播出去。在街头、集合场所我们到处可以听到《金日成将军之歌》。在李承晚叛徒曾横行的南半部，看到共和国旗在空中飘扬，听到《金日成将军之歌》，这是使人感激无比的。谈起解放的汉城市姿态，其概况就是这样。但这不过是极为抽象的描述而已。
    曾向一个汉城市民问他解放后的感想，他答称：“现在可安心过好日子了。”这简单的一句话，可以代表全市民的感情。
