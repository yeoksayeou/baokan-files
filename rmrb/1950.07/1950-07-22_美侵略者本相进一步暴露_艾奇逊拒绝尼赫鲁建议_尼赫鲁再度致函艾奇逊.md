　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The true face of American aggressors is further exposed.
    Acheson Rejects Nehru's Proposal
    Nehru Writes to Acheson Again
    After the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Stalin, sent a reply expressing welcome to the proposal of the Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the United States Secretary of State Acheson brazenly announced on the 19th his opposition to Nehru's proposal, thereby further exposing his true face as an aggressor. Despite the widely known fact that the American armed intervention in Korea is a threat to international peace and security, and that Korea would quickly return to peace once American troops withdraw from Korea, Acheson insisted in his reply that the American act of aggression in Korea was to restore international peace and security in the region, and hypocritically talked about "wishing" for "an early restoration of peace in Korea." Acheson rejected Nehru's proposal to have representatives of the People's Republic of China participate in the Security Council in order to restore the Security Council's legitimacy, thereby enabling it to handle the Korean issue. He said he did not believe the resolution of the Korean issue "has any connection with the resolution of other issues currently before the United Nations." This means that the United States continues to use the Security Council as a tool for its aggression against Korea, hindering the Security Council from fulfilling its duty of stopping aggression and maintaining peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, 21st: According to the United States Information Service, after receiving the reply from the United States Secretary of State Acheson on the 18th, Indian Prime Minister Nehru wrote to Acheson again on the 19th. In his letter, Nehru reiterated his advocacy for "breaking the current deadlock in the Security Council so that representatives of the People's Government of China can occupy their seats in the Security Council and the Soviet Union can return to the Security Council." Nehru believes that this "will create a suitable atmosphere for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

　　美侵略者本相进一步暴露
    艾奇逊拒绝尼赫鲁建议
    尼赫鲁再度致函艾奇逊
    【新华社二十一日讯】在苏联部长会议主席斯大林对印度总理尼赫鲁所提和平处理朝鲜问题的建议发出表示欢迎的复电以后，美国国务卿艾奇逊已于十九日悍然宣布反对尼赫鲁的建议，从而进一步暴露了其侵略者的本相。尽管尽人皆知美国武装干涉朝鲜是国际和平与安全的威胁，而一旦美国军队自朝鲜撤退，朝鲜很快就会恢复和平，但艾奇逊在其复文中硬说美国在朝鲜的侵略行为是恢复该地区国际和平与安全，并假惺惺地说什么“愿望”“早日恢复朝鲜和平”。艾奇逊拒绝了尼赫鲁关于使中华人民共和国代表参加安理会，以便使安理会恢复其合法性，从而得以处理朝鲜问题的建议。他说：他不相信朝鲜问题的解决“与现在联合国面前的其他问题之解决能有任何关联”。这就是说，美国继续要把安理会作为其侵略朝鲜的工具，阻挠安理会恢复其制止侵略、维护和平的职责。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据美国新闻处讯，印度总理尼赫鲁收到美国务卿艾奇逊十八日的复文后，于十九日再度致函艾奇逊。尼赫鲁在信中申述他主张“打破安理会目前的僵局，以便中国人民政府的代表能在安理会占有其席位，苏联能回到安理会来”。尼赫鲁认为这“将造成和平解决朝鲜问题的适宜的气氛”。
