　　Three Workers of Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot braved high heat to repair the boiler
　　Comrade Editor:
　　On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, locomotive 厶カ (five) 1554 of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot, after completing transportation task 994, returned to the depot at 18:00 and received task 173 of a passenger train at 20:00. However, the grate bars and grate bar pull rod of this locomotive were burned out. Under normal circumstances, it would be necessary to wait for the fire to go out before repairs could be made. The three workers of the boiler department of the second repair group, Fu Gengwo, Sun Honglu, and Jiao Changling, did not forget the saying "Increase locomotive turnaround rate, reduce downtime." They discussed using coal to suppress the fire first, so that the temperature dropped to 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). The three of them wet their clothes with water, wrapped their heads, and covered their mouths, taking turns entering the inner fire chamber to carry out repairs. Although the heat of the fire had been greatly reduced at that time, breathing became difficult for people at a temperature of 82 degrees Celsius. After 40 minutes, the burned-out grate bar pull rod and grate bars were replaced. The locomotive departed on time. Their tense and arduous work earned everyone's praise.

　　石家庄机务段三工友冒高热抢修锅炉编者同志：
    上月二十五日下午，石家庄机务段厶カ（五）一五五四号机车，担任九九四次运输后，于十八点回段，二十点又接受一七三次旅客列车任务。但这台机车的炉条和炉条拉杆被烧坏了，按一般情况，得等灭了火才能修理。第二包修组锅炉部工友傅庚我、孙鸿禄、焦昌岭三人，没有忘记“提高机车周转率，减少休车时间”这句话。就商量先用煤压住火，使温度降到华氏表一百八十度（即摄氏表八十二度）。他们三人用水淋湿了衣服，包住头，堵住嘴，一个轮着一个进入内火室，进行修理。当时火的热度虽已大大减低，但在八十二度的温度下人的呼吸感到了困难。四十分钟后，烧毁的炉条拉杆和炉条都换好了。机车正点开出。紧张艰巨的工作任务，赢得了大家的赞扬。    张英
