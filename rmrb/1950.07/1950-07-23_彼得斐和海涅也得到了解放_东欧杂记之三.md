　　Petőfi and Heine Have Also Been Liberated
    Eastern Europe Miscellany III
    Feng Zhi
    In Hungary, when you talk to people about Hungarian poets of the past, the most brilliant name is of course Petőfi. He is now loved by the people of Hungary, just like Pushkin in the Soviet Union. "But," one person working in the Hungarian Ministry of Culture said to me one day, "besides Petőfi, I would also like to introduce you to two poets, one is the progressive poet Ady from the beginning of the 20th century, and the other is József, a proletarian poet who committed suicide during the Horthy reactionary government era." I said that Petőfi has already been introduced in China, but I heard the other two names for the first time. He then promised me that he would find some German translations of Hungarian revolutionary poets for me. Two days later, I met him again, and he said, with great regret, that most of the foreign language translations of these poets he could find were love poems, and that the battle poems that expressed their great personalities had not been translated. So he couldn't give me these translations. At the same time, he added that in the old society, people always praised the love poems of these poets and belittled their battle poems.

    From this conversation, I thought of the literary historians and critics who served the ruling class in the previous century. Like Petőfi in Hungary and Heine in Germany, were originally "traitors" in the eyes of the rulers, and those literary historians were unwilling to admit the true meaning of these "traitors'" works. However, these "traitors" achieved great success in poetry due to their real lives and ardent conscience, and were loved by the people. The authors of literary history could not fail to mention them or completely deny their status, so they came up with a clever way, which was to only talk about their love poems and not talk about their battle poems. They also had their arguments, saying that battle poems had already passed with the times. In this way, they could express their "fairness" without offending their rulers. I think that the translators of Hungarian poets only translated love poems and not battle poems, more or less influenced by these literary historians.

    But when the capitalist society was on the decline around the time of the First World War, and so-called "modern people" showed abnormalities both physically and psychologically, healthy love poems were also rejected. They said that those love poems were superficial and not profound enough. In fact, progressive poets' love poems would further make people think of the shortcomings of society, which was also dangerous for the tottering capitalism. They covered up this danger and only used the word superficial to obliterate the value of the poems. As for not being profound enough, it was just not being abnormal enough. Therefore, during this period, the so-called cultural life in Europe and the United States was on the one hand, developing vulgar and despicable movies and detective novels in large quantities, and on the other hand, some self-proclaimed profound literati drilled into mysterious caves and wrote poems and prose that ordinary people could not understand. On the surface, the two seemed to be mutually hostile, one being vulgar and degenerate, and the other being profound and lofty. In fact, they were just two loyal servants of the rulers, using different methods to numb their people.

    When the fascist bandits gained power, they went even further. They not only ignored the people's poets, but also wantonly destroyed and slandered them. It is said that during the Horthy regime in Hungary, anyone who publicly recited Petőfi's revolutionary poems would be arrested. As for Heine, he became a double sinner in Nazi Germany. First, because he constantly attacked and satirized the reactionary politics of the first half of the 19th century in Germany, and second, because he was Jewish. His "Lorelei" was too popular, they could burn his collections of poems, but they could not burn this song from the mouths of the people. They fantasized and said that its author was "anonymous," causing many young people in Germany to not even know that there was a poet named Heine in Germany after the liberation!

    Now, the people have been liberated, and the people's poets have also been liberated. They are liberated from being misinterpreted, despised, and slandered, and present their entire lives to the people once again. They also receive the love from the people that they have never enjoyed before. We can hear Petőfi's name everywhere in Hungary. There is Petőfi Street, Petőfi Square, and children in kindergartens can tell Petőfi's story, how he participated in the revolution in 1848 and how he disappeared on the battlefield in the second year. Petőfi's portraits can be seen everywhere, in schools, in meeting places, on badges, and raised high by young people in parades (see illustration 1). In Germany, Heine's political poems are also being widely recited for the first time, his friendship with Marx is also beginning to be studied in depth, and he is listed alongside Goethe, Pushkin, and Gorky as four poets that German youth must read.

    Because of the experiences of Heine and Petőfi, I thought of my personal relationship with Western literature. When I was just learning German, I read several poems by Petőfi translated by Mr. Lu Xun and felt a fondness for them. Coincidentally, I found a German version of Petőfi's poems in the Peking University Library, with a biography of Petőfi at the beginning, so I wrote an introduction to Petőfi based on this biography. At the same time, I also liked to read Heine, and during this summer vacation I translated a travelogue by Heine. At that time, my German knowledge was very shallow, and there were many places I couldn't understand even with a dictionary. Both the Petőfi introduction I wrote and the Heine travelogue I translated were full of errors. Furthermore, my understanding of these two poets was also incorrect. For Petőfi, I was only moved by his rich and varied life of twenty-seven years. As for Heine, I only felt that his love poems were written so simply and naturally, and his social satire was so sharp. Later, as my knowledge gradually broadened, I read some writings by modern Western critics and felt that Petőfi and Heine were not "profound" enough. Those who were profound were some poets after the Symbolists. The so-called profound, to put it nicely, was that they could express the suffering of modern people, but the main reason was that their works were not easy to understand. So I left behind those fresh and bright poems that I used to love and found some things that were not easy to understand to read over and over again: as if the obscurity of the words was equivalent to expressing the suffering of modern people, and the suffering of modern people had to be obscure. Therefore, during the period when Mr. Lu Xun finished translating Fadeyev's "The Rout," I met Rilke. Under the influence of Rilke, I spent more than ten years. These ten years, as I recall now, were a wrong path, and later I spent a lot of effort but failed to completely get rid of his influence. It was not until the liberation of Beijing and studying Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought that I found the right path.

    During the period of capitalist decline, poets like Rilke were keenly aware of the various maladies in society. But he only felt them, and did not want to seek fundamental cures, but just embraced his own pain and plunged into a mysterious cave. He originally had many opportunities to embark on a progressive path, but once he came into contact with it, he turned his head back. He visited Tolstoy when he was young, met Gorky in middle age, and had boundless sympathy for the October Socialist Revolution, and was attacked by reactionary thugs as a result, but he did not look forward to the direction of social development because of this, but hid in an ancient castle in Switzerland, spending his days pondering his last and most obscure poems. Similar to his situation, many Western European poets are walking this tragic path. Obvious examples are the two British poets, Auden and Spender, who once participated in the Spanish Civil War and then retreated into the dark maze. Nowadays, these kinds of poets, whether living or dead, are lined up alongside vulgar movies and detective novels in capitalist countries to embellish "civilization" for those reactionary rulers. No matter how keen their senses are, how lofty their behavior is, or how hard they work at writing poetry, if they do not embark on the road of serving the people, they will inevitably degenerate into a small pawn under the cruel exploiters. Because we clearly see that during the years when the German fascist bandits filled their own country and the countries they enslaved with concentration camps and built killing fields, Heine's collections of poems disappeared from bookstores, while Rilke's poems and letters were being printed one after another; in the present when the imperialists are inciting war and carrying out aggression, Rilke is even more popular in the United States...

    Thanks to this great era of the people, many people have jumped out of the "unfathomable" obscure magic palace. The most admirable is the Chilean poet Neruda. When he wrote a poem dedicated to Stalingrad, he began by writing:

    "In the past, I wrote about time, I wrote about the sea,
    I wrote about sorrow, wearing purple metal clothes,
    I wrote about the sky, I wrote about the swaying of apple trees,
    Now I, ah, I sing for you, Stalingrad."

    At the same time, he said, "When I see young... Argentinians or Cubans admiring Kafka, Rilke, or Lawrence, I am filled with rage... Young and ignorant youths appear prematurely old because they are single-mindedly concerned with 'pure poetry,' they forget the basic responsibilities of mankind... Anyone who does not participate in the battle today is a coward... Only in our struggle can we find the inexhaustible source of art." (Note)

    I also cannot forget a conversation with Nexø. This eighty-year-old Danish writer has been traveling in various Eastern European democratic countries for half a year, giving speeches everywhere to defend peace. On the third day after we arrived in Hungary, he also arrived in Budapest and stayed in the same hotel as us. He told us that the victory of the Chinese people greatly strengthened the peace camp; he said that he received a congratulatory telegram from Chairman Mao when he celebrated his eightieth birthday in his hometown last year, and he felt supreme glory. And asked about many situations after China's liberation. When he heard that I had written some poems, he said to me with a smile, "Don't write love poems, write more battle poems!"

    When I heard these words from him, I felt infinite shame. I thought to myself, respected master, you should have said to me, "Don't write those contemplative, so-called 'modern' poems, write more battle poems." Perhaps you have been fighting all your life, and those literary wizards after the European Symbolists have never attracted your attention...

    (Note) This passage and the above few lines of poetry are all from Ehrenburg's article "Pablo Neruda," which was published in the October 1949 issue of "Soviet Literature." I am quoting here from Mr. Zhuang Shouchi's Chinese translation in the second issue of the second volume of "Translation Monthly." There is an article "The Victory of Petőfi" in the same issue of "Translation Monthly," and I consulted this article when organizing this miscellany. (Attached picture)

　　彼得斐和海涅也得到了解放
    东欧杂记之三
    冯至
    在匈牙利，和人谈起匈牙利过去的诗人，其中最灿烂的名字当然是彼得斐。他如今被匈牙利的人民爱戴，有如普式金在苏联一般。“但是，”一天一个在匈牙利文化部里工作的人向我说，“除了彼得斐，我还愿意向你介绍两个诗人，一个是二十世纪初期的进步诗人阿弟，一个是霍尔梯反动政府时代自杀的无产阶级诗人约塞夫。”我说，彼得斐在中国已经有人介绍过，另外的两个名字我还是第一次听见。他于是答应我，替我找一些匈牙利革命诗人的德文翻译。过了两天，我又遇见他，他说，很抱歉，他能找到的这几个诗人的外国文的翻译，多半是一些爱情诗，至于表现他们伟大人格的战斗的诗歌，都没有译出。所以他不能把这些翻译给我。同时他附带着说，在旧日的社会里，人们对待这些诗人，总是表扬他们的爱情诗，贬低他们的战斗诗。
    从这段谈话里我想到了前世纪为统治阶级服务的文学史家和文艺批评者。像匈牙利的彼得斐，德国的海涅，在统治者的眼中本来都是“叛徒”，那些文学史家是不肯承认这些“叛徒”们的作品的真意义的。但这些“叛徒”由于真实的生活与炽热的良心在诗歌上得到伟大的成功，为人民爱好，文学史的作者不能对他们一字不提或是完全否定他们的地位，于是想出一个巧妙的办法，就是只讲他们的爱情诗，不谈他们的战斗诗。他们也有他们的论据，就是说战斗诗已经随着时代过去了。这样既可以表示他们的“公平”，也不至于得罪他们的统治者。我想，匈牙利诗人的翻译者之所以只译爱情诗不译战斗诗，或多或少是受了这些文学史家的影响。
    但是等到第一次世界大战前后，资本主义社会走着下坡路，所谓“现代人”无论在生理上或心理上都显出变态时，健康的爱情诗也被排斥了，他们说那些爱情诗是浅薄的，不够深刻。其实，进步诗人的爱情诗进一步便会使人想到社会的缺欠，对于那摇摇欲坠的资本主义也是危险的，他们掩盖了这种危险，只用浅薄二字抹杀诗的价值，至于不够深刻，只是不够变态而已。所以在这时期，欧美的所谓文化生活就是一方面大量发展那些粗俗的卑鄙的电影和侦探小说，一方面有些自命高深的文人钻入神秘的洞穴写些一般人不能理解的诗和散文。表面看来，二者好像互相敌对，一个是庸俗堕落，一个是深刻清高，事实上不过都是统治者的两个忠实的仆役，取不同的方式来麻醉他的人民。
    等到法西斯匪徒获得政权，更是变本加厉，他们不但不理会人民诗人，而且横加摧残，任意诬蔑。据说在匈牙利霍尔梯的统治时期，谁若是当众朗诵了彼得斐的革命诗歌，就会遭受逮捕。至于海涅在德国的纳粹时代更成为双重的罪人。第一因为他对于十九世纪前半期德国的反动政治不断地攻击讽刺，第二因为他是犹太人。他的“罗雷赖女仙歌”太普遍了，他们能焚毁他的诗集，但不能把这首歌从人民的口中烧去，他们却想入非非，说它的作者是“无名氏”。致使德国解放后有许多青年竟不知德国诗人中有一个人叫作海涅！
    如今，人民得到解放，人民的诗人也得到解放。他们从被曲解，被轻视，被诬蔑里解放出来，把全部的生命再一次呈献给人民。他们也从人民中得到从来不曾享受过的爱戴。我们在匈牙利到处可以听到彼得斐的名字，有彼得斐大街，彼得斐广场，幼稚园里的小孩子都会说彼得斐的故事，他怎样在一八四八年参加革命，怎样在第二年在战场上失踪。到处可以看到彼得斐的像，在学校里，在会场里，在徽章上，在游行队伍中间被青年们高高举起（见插图一）。在德国，海涅的政治诗也第一次被人普遍诵读，他和马克思的交谊也起始被人深入地研究，他和歌德、普式金、高尔基并列，被规定为德国青年必读的四个诗人。
    由于海涅和彼得斐的遭遇，我想到我个人和西洋文学的一些因缘。在我刚刚学习德文时，我读到鲁迅先生翻译的几首彼得斐的诗，感到爱好。正巧在北京大学图书馆里找到一部德文版的彼得斐诗集，前边有一篇彼得斐的传记，我于是根据这篇传记写了一篇彼得斐介绍。同时我也喜欢读海涅，在这年暑假里译了一部海涅的游记。那时我的德文知识是很浅陋的，抱着字典都有许多地方看不懂，无论写的彼得斐介绍或是译的海涅游记，都错误百出；并且对于这两个诗人的认识也不正确，对于彼得斐，我只是被他那二十七年丰富多变的生活所感动，至于海涅，我只觉得他的爱情诗写得那样单纯自然，社会的讽刺是那样尖锐。后来见闻渐渐广了，读了一些现代西方批评家的文字，觉得彼得斐、海涅不够“深刻”了，深刻的是象征派以后的一些诗人。所谓深刻，说得好听一点，是以为他们能够表达出现代人的苦闷，其实主要的原因是他们的作品不容易了解。我于是把往日爱过的那些清新明快的诗歌丢在脑后，找来些不容易了解的东西读来读去：好像文字的晦涩就等于表现出现代人的苦闷，现代人的苦闷非晦涩不可似的。所以在鲁迅先生译完了法捷耶夫的“毁灭”的时期，我却遇见了里尔克。在里尔克的影响下我过了十几年，这十几年，我如今回想，是一条错而又错的道路，后来我费了很大的力都没有能够完全摆脱开他的影响。直到北京解放，学习了毛主席的文艺思想，才找到了正当的大道。
    在资本主义的没落期，像里尔克那样的诗人对于社会中种种病态是锐敏地感到了的。但他只是感到，并不想寻求根本治疗的方法，只是抱着自己的痛苦投入神秘的洞穴。他本来有过许多机会，可能走上进步的道路，但他一经接触，便转回了头。他少年时拜访过托尔斯泰，中年时会晤过高尔基，十月社会主义革命他寄与无限的同情，并且因而受了反动暴徒的袭击，但他并不由此向前瞻望社会发展的方向，却躲到瑞士的一个古堡中，终日推敲他最后的，也是最晦涩的诗篇。和他情形相似，许多西欧的诗人都走着这悲惨的道路，显明的例子是那两个一度参加过西班牙内战随后又退入幽暗的迷宫里的英国诗人奥登和史奔特尔。如今这类诗人，无论是活的或是死的，都在资本主义国家里和下流电影与侦探小说并排着给那些反动的统治者点缀“文明”。不管他们感觉多么锐敏，处世多么清高，写诗多么费力，若是不走上为人民服务的道路，总不免要堕落为残酷的剥削者手下的一个小卒。因为我们分明看见，在德国的法西斯匪徒们在他们本国和他们奴役的国家内布满集中营广设杀人场的岁月中，海涅的诗集在书店里绝迹，而里尔克的诗和信札却一本一本地在印行；在帝国主义者煽动战争，进行侵略的现在，里尔克在美国更为流行………
    感谢这伟大的人民的时代，使不少的人从那“深不可测的”晦涩的魔宫里跳出来了。最值得钦佩的是智利诗人聂鲁达，当他写一首诗献给斯大林格勒时，一开头就这样写：
    “从前我写时光，我写海洋，
    我写忧愁，穿着紫色的金属衣裳，
    我写天空，我写苹果树的摇荡，
    如今我呀，我为你斯大林格勒歌唱。”
    同时他说，“当我看到年青的……阿根廷人或是古巴人恋慕卡夫卡，里尔克，或是劳伦斯的时候，我就怒不可遏……年幼无知的青年人因为一心关怀‘纯诗’而显得未老先衰，他们忘掉了人类的基本的责任……凡是今天不参加战斗的人就是懦夫。……在我们的斗争中才能找到艺术的取之不尽的源泉。”（注）
    我同样不能忘记的是和尼克索的一段谈话。这位八十岁的丹麦的作家，半年以来都在东欧各民主国家旅行，到处作保卫和平的讲演，在我们到达匈牙利后的第三天，他也到了布达佩斯，和我们住在同一的旅馆里。他向我们说，中国人民的胜利使和平阵营大大加强了；他说，他去年在他的家乡过八十岁生日时，得到毛主席的贺电，他感到无上的光荣。并且问到许多中国解放后的情形。他听说我曾经写过一些诗，他便笑容满面地向我说，“你不要写爱情诗，要多写战斗的诗！”
    我听了他这句话，我感到无限的惭愧。我心里想，敬重的大师，你应该向我说，“你不要写那些沉思默想的，所谓‘现代’的诗，要多写战斗的诗。”也许你一生战斗，欧洲象征派以后的那些文字的巫师们从来不曾引你注意过……
    （附注）这段文字和上边的几行诗都见于爱伦堡写的《巴勃雍·聂鲁达》一文，这篇文章发表于《苏联文学》一九四九年十月号。我这里引的是根据《翻译月刊》二卷二期庄寿慈先生的中译。在同一期的《翻译月刊》里有一篇《彼得斐的胜利》，我整理这篇杂记时曾参看了这篇文章。（附图片）
