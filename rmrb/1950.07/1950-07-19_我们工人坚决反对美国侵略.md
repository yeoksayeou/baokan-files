We Workers Resolutely Oppose American Aggression
	Tian Guiying, Female Driver of "March 8th" Locomotive, Dalian Locomotive Depot, Northeast
	We workers love peace because peace guarantees our work and our lives, so we resolutely oppose the imperialist schemes to provoke new wars and acts of aggression. Just like the dockworkers and railway workers in France, Italy, and Belgium who refuse to unload American weapons for the reactionary factions in Western Europe, we oppose wars of aggression! How much the French workers love their country! When a young female worker saw a train carrying American tanks speeding by, she unhesitatingly lay down on the tracks, followed by two more, and then a large group of male and female workers all lay down. The driver, seeing this situation, was moved by the patriotism of these young men and women workers, stopped the train, and got out, saying he wouldn't do it anymore. Their actions dealt a severe blow to imperialism. Let the imperialist warmongers tremble before us! The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming stronger and more consolidated day by day! I myself am a standing committee member of the Dalian branch of the China Peace Committee and a train driver in the railway transport industry. I must do a good job in the transport industry for the construction of a peaceful and democratic New China and enthusiastically respond to the call of the Dalian branch of the China Peace Committee to launch a signature campaign. Not only will I enthusiastically respond myself, but I will also mobilize all comrades in the depot to resolutely participate in the signature campaign, expose the war conspiracies of imperialism, and strive to defend world peace!

　　我们工人坚决反对美国侵略
    东北大连机务段“三八”号机车女司机  田桂英 
    我们工人是热爱和平的，因为和平保证了我们的工作，保证了我们的生活，所以我们坚决反对帝国主义挑拨新战争的阴谋和侵略行为。也正像法国、意大利、比利时的码头工人、铁路工人，都拒绝卸运美国给西欧各国反动派的武器一样，我们反对侵略战争！法国的工人是多么热爱着他们的祖国啊！当一个青年女工看见一列载着美国坦克的火车飞快的开来，她毫不犹疑地躺在铁轨上，接着又有两个，一大群的男女工人都躺下来。开车的司机看到这种情况，被热爱祖国的这一群男女青年工人们感动了，停住车，自己也下来说不干了。他们的这种举动给帝国主义一个严重打击。让帝国主义战争贩子们在我们的面前发抖吧！以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，一天比一天更强大更巩固起来了！我自己是中国保卫世界和平大会大连分会的一个常设委员，又是铁路运输事业上的火车司机，我一定要把为建设和平民主新中国的运输事业搞好，热烈响应中国保卫世界和平大会大连分会展开签名运动的号召。不仅自己热烈响应，我同时还要动员全段同志，坚决参加签名运动，揭露帝国主义的战争阴谋，为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗！
