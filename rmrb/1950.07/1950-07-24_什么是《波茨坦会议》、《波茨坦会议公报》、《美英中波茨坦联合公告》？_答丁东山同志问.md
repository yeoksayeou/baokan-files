Comrade Ding Dongshan:

　　On May 8, 1945, the powerful Soviet Red Army completely defeated Germany. To ensure international peace, security, and cooperation, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain held a conference in Potsdam, near Berlin, on July 17.

　　The main achievement of this conference was to establish a plan for dealing with the German question and the basis for post-war international cooperation. The conference also discussed the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan.

　　In the "Potsdam Conference Communiqué" issued at this conference, the three countries unanimously declared that the United Nations would establish a just and lasting peace; that German militarism and fascism would be eradicated; that Germany's war potential would be eliminated; and that the political life of the German people would be rebuilt on a democratic and peaceful basis. The three countries also reached an agreement on the issue of German reparations. In addition, the Potsdam Conference decided to establish a Council of Foreign Ministers of the five countries: China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France.

　　On July 26 of the same year, China, the United States, and Britain issued the "Joint Potsdam Declaration by the United States, Britain, and China" from Potsdam, urging Japan to surrender unconditionally. It also put forward the terms of surrender to Japan: implementing the conditions stipulated in the "Cairo Declaration," limiting Japan's sovereignty to its Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other small islands determined by the United States, Britain, and China, completely disarming the Japanese army, and restricting Japan's war industries, etc.

　　After the war, the Soviet Union has unswervingly adhered to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. In East Germany, the Soviet Union assisted the German people in carrying out political reforms on a peaceful and democratic basis, eliminating the remnants of fascism, and systematically restoring the peaceful economic life of the German people. On October 7 last year, with the support of the Soviet Union, the German people established a central government for all of Germany with Berlin as its capital.

　　In contrast, the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism has been trying to preserve the remaining forces of fascism. In West Germany, they are trying their best to suppress people's democracy, preserve reactionary forces, split Germany, and control the German economy, in an attempt to make West Germany a base for anti-Soviet and anti-democratic forces in Europe. In Japan, US imperialism is actively helping Japan rearm itself every day: openly sheltering war criminals, preserving the assets of monopoly capitalists, supporting reactionary governments in destroying the democratic movement, canceling reparations plans, rebuilding the army, navy, and air force, and obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan…

　　All of this shows that American imperialism has abandoned the obligations that the United States should fulfill under the "Potsdam Conference Communiqué" and the "Joint Potsdam Declaration by the United States, Britain, and China." It is following the path taken by German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, and it will inevitably be spurned by all democratic and peace-loving people around the world.

### 什么是《波茨坦会议》、《波茨坦会议公报》、《美英中波茨坦联合公告》？——答丁东山同志问

　　什么是《波茨坦会议》、《波茨坦会议公报》、《美英中波茨坦联合公告》？
    ——答丁东山同志问丁东山同志：
    一九四五年五月八日，强大的苏联红军，彻底击败了德国。为了保证国际的和平、安全与合作，七月十七日，苏美英三国在柏林近郊的波茨坦举行会议。
    这一会议主要的成果，便是确立了处理德国问题的方案，及战后国际合作的基础。在会议上并讨论了苏联参加对日作战的问题。
    在这一会议所发布的《波茨坦会议公报》中，三国一致声明：联合国将进行建立公正而持久的和平；并将根除德国的军国主义和法西斯主义，消灭德国的作战潜力，准备在民主与和平的基础上，重建德国人民的政治生活。三国在处置德国赔款问题上，也达到了协议。此外，波茨坦会议还决定设立中、苏、美、英、法五国外长会议。
    同年七月廿六日，中、美、英三国又由波茨坦发出《美英中波茨坦联合公告》，促使日本无条件投降。它并对日本提出投降的条款：实施《开罗宣言》所规定的条件，将日本的主权限于其本州、北海道、九州、四国及中美英三国所决定的其他小岛之内，完全解除日军武装，及限制日本的作战工业等。
    战后，苏联始终不渝地信守着波茨坦协议的原则。苏联在东德协助德国人民在和平与民主的基础上进行了政治改革，肃清了法西斯的余毒，有计划地恢复德国人民的和平经济生活。去年十月七日，德国人民就在苏联的赞助下，以柏林为首都，建立了全德中央政府。
    但与此相反，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团，却一直设法保存法西斯主义的残存力量。在西德，他们竭力压制人民民主，保存反动势力，分裂德国，控制德国经济，以图将西德成为欧洲反苏反民主的基地。在日本，美帝国主义亦无日不在积极帮助日本重新武装：公开庇护战争罪犯，保存独占财阀的资产，支持反动政府摧残民主运动，取消赔偿计划，重建陆海空军，阻挠对日和约的缔结……。
    凡此一切，都说明着，美国帝国主义已经抛弃了《波茨坦会议公报》和《美英中波茨坦联合公告》上的美国应尽的义务，它正在走着德、意、日法西斯所走过的道路，也就不得不遭受全世界爱好民主、和平的人民的一致唾弃了。
