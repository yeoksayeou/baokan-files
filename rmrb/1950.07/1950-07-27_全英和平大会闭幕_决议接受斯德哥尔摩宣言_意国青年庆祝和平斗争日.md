Xinhua News Agency, July 26th Dispatch from TASS, London: The All-England Peace Congress, held in London, closed on the afternoon of the 23rd after a grand rally in Trafalgar Square. More than 20,000 people participated in the rally, including workers, intellectuals, mothers with children, Indians, Africans, and visitors from the Dominions.

The chairman of the congress, Crowther, announced amidst applause that the British peace movement, which has become widespread, has accepted and approved the Stockholm Declaration.

The Mayor of Liverpool, Miss Keeling, who received the Order of the British Empire for her wartime service, said that she supports peace because she had witnessed the destruction of Liverpool by air raids during the war. Miss Keeling emphasized the need to ban atomic bombs.

When the Soviet writer Ehrenburg took the stage, he was greeted with waves of cheers and applause. Ehrenburg, on behalf of the Soviet Peace Committee, called on the people of London to stop the war.

Halfway through the congress, it suddenly began to rain, but the crowd stood firm until the speakers had finished their last words.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th Dispatch from TASS, Rome: Mass rallies and demonstrations were held throughout Italy on the 23rd to celebrate the "Italian Youth Day of Struggle for Peace." Tens of thousands of young peace fighters expressed their determination to ban atomic weapons on this day, and denounced the aggressive plans of the American imperialists and their European lackeys, who obsequiously carry out the orders to arm their countries and prepare "cannon fodder" for the United States.

At mass rallies and demonstrations held in Florence, Bologna, Venice, and other Italian cities, tens of thousands more people were collected to sign the Stockholm Declaration.
