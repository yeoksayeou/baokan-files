Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Since the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace passed the peace declaration demanding the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons on March 19th, and called on the people of the world to sign the peace declaration, peace-loving people in all countries have enthusiastically launched a signature campaign to support this declaration, and have regarded it as the central task of the current struggle to defend peace. By the time the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee met in London at the end of May, 100 million people around the world had signed the peace declaration. From that time to the present, according to extremely incomplete statistics, more than 40 million people have participated in the signing. The peace signature has united the people of the world, regardless of nationality or race, political belief or religious belief, and declared their determination to defend peace.

People's Democratic Countries Successfully Complete Task

The peace signature campaign in the people's democratic countries has developed most rapidly with the unanimous and enthusiastic participation of governments and people, and is the most advanced part of the world. In Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, and Mongolia, the task of the peace signature campaign has been successfully completed, and most of the people in these countries have signed the peace declaration.

In Hungary, more than 7,230,000 people participated in the signing, accounting for 79 percent of the country's population of 9.2 million. Bulgaria had more than 6,140,000 signatures, accounting for 88 percent of the country's population of 7 million. Poland had 18 million signatures, accounting for 80 percent of the country's population of 23.8 million. Czechoslovakia had more than 9,480,000 signatures, accounting for 79 percent of the country's population of 12 million. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea had 5,680,000 signatures. The Mongolian People's Republic had more than 686,000 signatures.

Our Country's Number of Signatures Exceeds 27 Million

The peace signature campaign in other people's democratic countries is continuing. To date, the German Democratic Republic has had 17 million signatures. Albania has had more than 400,000.

Since the People's Republic of China launched the signature campaign on May 1st, the number of signatures to date has reached more than 27 million.

The peace signature campaign in the great socialist country, the bulwark of world peace and democracy, the Soviet Union, began on June 30th.

In capitalist countries, colonies and dependent countries, peace fighters, regardless of the reactionary governments' brutal suppression and persecution, are striving to get more and more people to participate in peace signatures, in order to directly strike at the imperialists' war preparations plans.

People of Capitalist Countries Sign Enthusiastically

In France and Italy, 8 million people have signed in each country, accounting for about one-third of the total number of voters in the two countries. The peace fighters in these two countries are working with great enthusiasm. An old mother named Serra in Italy personally collected more than 7,000 signatures.

In the United Kingdom, 600,000 people have signed the peace declaration. Austria has 500,000. Finland has 300,000. The Netherlands has 110,000. In the United States, which is directly ruled by the head of the imperialist war-mongers, the number of signatories has reached 500,000. In West Germany, which is under the direct military occupation of the United States, Britain, and France, the number of signatories has reached 2 million, and even some soldiers in the US occupying forces in West Germany have participated in the signing. Even in Spain, under fascist terror rule, peace signatures are being carried out in secret.

In Japan, under MacArthur's military occupation, the number of people participating in peace signatures has reached 1.01 million.

While carrying out the peace signature campaign, peace fighters in various countries have widely established national or local peace committees. Under the leadership of these peace committees, the struggle to defend peace is being combined with the struggle to win the vital interests of all working people, to win democracy, to win socialism, and to win national independence.

The existing achievements of the peace signature campaign have already caused panic in the imperialist camp. Observers of the Western European war-mongers helplessly said: The Stockholm Declaration "has dangerous latency and there is no good counter-propaganda to deal with it." (Associated Press) Hoffman, the executor of the US Marshall Plan, also cried out because of the achievements of the peace signature, "What makes me most upset" (Agence France-Presse). However, the imperialist reactionaries are stepping up war preparations more frantically in their panic, which all peace fighters must be seriously vigilant about.

In order to mobilize all upright people to participate in the struggle against the war of aggression, peace fighters around the world are responding to the call of the London meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee and are conducting friendship competitions to further promote the signature campaign. We will strive to increase the number of people signing the peace declaration by hundreds of millions before the opening of the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace in the latter half of October.

　　世界保卫和平运动不断高涨
    一亿四千万人参加签名
    【新华社一日讯】自从世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议于三月十九日通过要求无条件禁止原子武器的和平宣言，并号召全世界人民在和平宣言上签名以来，世界各国爱好和平的人民，已热烈展开了支持这一宣言的签名运动，并把它当作当前保卫和平斗争的中心任务。到五月底世界和大常委会执行局在伦敦开会时，全世界即已有一万万人在和平宣言上签名。从那时起到现在，根据极不完全的统计，又已有四千万以上的人参加了签名。和平签名已经使全世界的人民不分民族或种族，不分政治信仰与宗教信仰地团结起来，并宣告他们保卫和平的决心。
    人民民主国家胜利完成任务
    人民民主国家的和平签名运动，在政府和人民一致热烈参加下，发展最为迅速，是全世界最先进的部分。在匈、保、波、罗、捷、朝鲜、蒙古诸国，和平签名运动的任务已经胜利完成，这些国家的大部分人民已在和平宣言上签了名。
    在匈牙利，参加签名的有七百二十三万余人，占全国九百二十万人口的百分之七十九。保加利亚有六百一十四万余人签名，占全国七百万人口的百分之八十八。波兰有一千八百万人签名，占全国二千三百八十万人口的百分之八十。捷克斯洛伐克有九百四十八万余人签名，占全国一千二百万人口的百分之七十九。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国有五百六十八万人签名。蒙古人民共和国有六十八万六千余人签名。
    我国签名人数逾二千七百万
    其他人民民主国家的和平签名运动在继续展开中。到最近为止，德意志民主共和国已有一千七百万人签名。阿尔巴尼亚已有四十余万人。
    中华人民共和国自“五一”节开始签名运动以来，签名的迄今已达二千七百余万人。
    全世界和平民主的堡垒——伟大的社会主义国家苏联的和平签名运动，已于六月三十日开始。
    在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国家，和平战士们不顾反动政府的残酷镇压与迫害，正在争取日益增多的群众参加和平签名，以直接打击帝国主义的备战计划。
    资本主义国家人民热烈签名
    在法国和意大利，已各有八百万人签名，各占两国选民总数的三分之一左右。这两个国家的和平战士们以极大的热情去开展工作，意大利一位名叫赛拉的老母亲，曾亲自征集了七千人以上的签名。
    在英国，已有六十万人在和平宣言上签名。奥地利已有五十万人。芬兰已有三十万人。荷兰已有十一万人。在帝国主义战贩头子直接统治下的美国，签名者亦已达五十万人。在美、英、法三国直接军事占领下的西德，签名者已达二百万人，连美国驻西德占领军中的部分兵士也参加了签名。甚至在法西斯恐怖统治下的西班牙，也在秘密地进行和平签名。
    在麦克阿瑟的军事占领之下的日本，参加和平签名的人们也已达一百零一万。
    与进行和平签名运动同时，各国的和平战士们已广泛地建立了全国或地方和平委员会。在这些和平委员会的领导下，保卫和平的斗争，正与争取一切劳动人民的切身利益、争取民主、争取社会主义以及争取民族独立的斗争结合起来。
    和平签名运动已有的成就，业已引起帝国主义阵营的惊慌。西欧战争贩子的观察家无可奈何地说：斯德哥尔摩宣言“有危险的潜伏性，并且没有好的反宣传来对付它。”（美联社）美国马歇尔计划的执行人霍夫曼，也因和平签名的成就而大呼“最使我伤脑筋”（法新社）。但是，帝国主义反动派在惊慌之余，正在愈加疯狂地进行着战争准备，这是所有和平战士必须严重警惕的。
    全世界和平战士为着动员一切正直的人们参加反对侵略战争的斗争，正在响应世界和大常委会执行局伦敦会议的号召，进行友谊竞赛，以进一步推广签名运动。争取在第二届世界拥护和平大会于十日下旬开幕之前，增加亿万人民在和平宣言上签名。
