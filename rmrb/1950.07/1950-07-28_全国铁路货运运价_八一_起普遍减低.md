　　Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has submitted to and obtained approval from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to generally reduce national railway freight rates from August 1st and adjust freight charge grades. The original Northern and Southern railway freight rates were divided into twenty grades, now increased to thirty grades (Northeast railways have been thirty grades in the past). The freight rates are reduced by an average of 11.9% compared with the current freight rates. Among them, in addition to the general reduction of general cargo freight rates, the main thing is to reduce the differential rates of freight rates in the interior. In the past, the first-class freight rate of railways in the interior was 25.34 times that of the last-class freight rate, but now it has been reduced to 17 times. Less-than-carload freight rates used to be twice as high as full-carload freight rates, but now they have been reduced to only 70% higher. In addition, seven types of miscellaneous fees have been cancelled, and miscellaneous fee rates have been generally reduced.
　　The methods for reducing freight rate differentials and less-than-carload freight rates issued by the Ministry of Railways this time are formulated in accordance with the Central People's Government's policy of adjusting industry and commerce and encouraging the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The purpose is to help private industry and commerce overcome the current difficulties in the sluggish sales of goods. Because the goods listed in the higher grades are mostly luxury goods and high-end consumer goods, etc., these goods are neither necessary for industrial and agricultural production, nor are they necessary for the broad masses of people at present, so high freight rates are reasonable. However, at present, this part of private industry and commerce has greater difficulties. Reducing freight rate differentials can help them open up a part of sales channels, so that some of the better-managed enterprises can maintain production with the help of the government. Secondly, less-than-carload cargo consumes car space, so it is reasonable for freight rates to be higher than full-carload cargo. However, due to China's economic backwardness, except for coal, grain, timber, minerals and other goods operated by the state, it is mostly not easy to make up a full carload. Therefore, reducing the freight of less-than-carload goods actually mainly reduces the freight expenditure of private industrialists and businessmen, thereby helping them to open up markets.
　　The main reason for changing freight from 20 grades to 30 grades is to more rationally place materials of different importance to the development of production and the supply of urban and rural areas in appropriate grades. For example, in the past, because there were few grades, we had to put waste silk and raw silk, which have different functions, in the same grade. After the increase in classification, this unreasonable phenomenon has been appropriately improved.
　　Note: Prior to this, the Ministry of Railways had reduced the freight rates of various export materials such as tea, raw silk, wool, and tung oil, and the freight rates of imported cotton on July 1st; on the 13th, it also reduced the freight rates of three food grains, wheat, rice and flour, on the Northern and Southern railways. This price reduction is of a general nature.

### 全国铁路货运运价“八一”起普遍减低

　　全国铁路货运运价“八一”起普遍减低
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府铁道部业经呈准政务院财经委员会，自八月一日起普遍减低全国铁路货运运价，并调整货运收费等级。北方、南方铁路货物运价原分二十等，现在添至三十等（东北铁路过去即为三十等）。运价则平均较现行运价减低百分之十一点九。其中除一般贷物运价均有所减低外，主要的是减低了关内铁路货物运价的差率。过去关内铁路一等货运运价为末等货运运价的二十五点三四倍，现在则减为十七倍。零担货运运价过去比整车货运运价高一倍，现在则减至只高百分之七十。此外又取消了七种杂费，并普遍降低了杂费率。
    此次铁道部所颁减低货运运价差率和零担货运运价的办法，是根据中央人民政府调整工商业的政策和鼓励城乡物资交流的政策而制订的。其目的在于帮助私营工商业克服目前货物滞销的困难。因为列在较高等级上的货物，多半是奢侈品和高级消费品等，这些货物既非工农业生产所必须，而在目前也非广大人民群众所必须，因此运价高是合理的。但是目前这一部分私营工商业的困难较大，减低运价差率，就可以帮助它们打开一部分销路，从而使其中一些经营较好的企业得以在政府帮助下，维持生产。其次，零担货物虚耗车位，因之运价比整车货物高也是合理的。但是，由于我国经济落后，除煤、粮、木材、矿石等由国家经营的货物外，多半不易凑成整车。故减低零担货物运费实际上主要地是减低私营工商业者的运费支出，从而帮助其开拓市场。
    货运从二十等改为三十等的主要原因，在于把对发展生产和供应城乡重要性各不相同的物资更加合理地放在适当的等级上。如过去因为等级少，就只好把作用不同的废丝和生丝列在同一等级上。分等增加后，这种不合理的现象就得到了适当改善。
    按：在此以前，铁道部曾在七月一日减低了茶叶、生丝、羊毛、桐油等多种出口物资的运价，及进口棉花的运价；十三日又减低了北方、南方铁路的小麦、大米和面粉三种食粮的运价。这次的减价，则是普通性的。
