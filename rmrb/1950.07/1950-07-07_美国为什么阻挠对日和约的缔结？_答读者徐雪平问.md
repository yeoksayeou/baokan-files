　　Why is the United States Obstructing the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Japan?
    ——Answering Reader Xu Xueping's Question
    Editor:
    It has been almost five years since Japan surrendered, but a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, and it is not known when it can be signed. China and the Soviet Union both advocate for the swift signing of this treaty, while American imperialism is doing its utmost to delay and obstruct it, as everyone knows. But I am not entirely clear as to why the United States is obstructing the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. I hope you can answer this question.
   Xu Xueping, July 3rd
   Comrade Xueping:
    The Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, stipulated: "The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated forever, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world." Article 10 further stipulated: "We do not intend to enslave the Japanese as a race nor to destroy them as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established." That is to say, Japan must eradicate militarism and undergo thorough democratization. However, for the past five years, the U.S. government has adopted policies on the Japanese question that are completely contrary to the aforementioned proclamation and other international agreements. The United States has worked hard to foster the revival of Japanese militarism, vigorously suppressed the democratic movement of the Japanese people, indulged Japanese war criminals, and intensified its efforts to transform Japan into a colony and military base of the United States. The United States attempted to bypass the legal procedures of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and directly convene a meeting of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, in order to facilitate its own manipulation. After this plan was opposed by the Soviet Union, it indefinitely delayed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan and attempted to make a separate peace with Japan in order to facilitate the long-term occupation of Japan.
    The Soviet Union has consistently insisted that the legally prescribed steps of international agreements must be followed and that a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan be prepared and concluded swiftly.
    In August 1947, the Soviet government said in its reply to the U.S. note: "The Soviet government believes that the United States has no reason to unilaterally convene a peace conference and that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference should first discuss the issue of convening a conference to draft a peace treaty with Japan, because the decision of the Potsdam Conference to establish the Council of Foreign Ministers was to have it carry out the necessary preparatory work for resolving the peace treaty issue."
    On November 6, 1948, Molotov, in his report celebrating the Great October Socialist Revolution, reiterated: "The Soviet Union advocates the speedy conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan in accordance with the agreements predetermined by the Allies. Only those who attempt to endlessly prolong the occupation disregard the legitimate interests of their people and evade the implementation of the aforementioned international agreements."
    In May 1949, Vyshinsky suggested at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference that a date be set for the Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss this important issue. He also suggested that Chinese representatives should participate in the discussion. But the United States adopted a rejecting attitude and, disregarding the decision of the Potsdam Conference, declared that the U.S. government did not consider the Foreign Ministers' Conference "an appropriate organization to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan."
    On February 14, 1950, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed between China and the Soviet Union, one of which states:
    "The two contracting parties undertake to secure jointly, in agreement with each other, and in consultation with the other Allied Powers in the Second World War, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan at the earliest possible date."
    However, the U.S. government has continued to delay and procrastinate on the issue of signing a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
    The U.S. government's reason for refusing to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan is that they are unwilling to withdraw their occupying forces and are unwilling to stop their sinister plan to transform Japan into an American colony and military base.
    The U.S. government is turning Japan into a military strategic base for aggression against the Far East. The U.S. aggression plan in Japan is no longer a secret. MacArthur openly declared in his May 4th reply to the memorandum from the Soviet representative of the Allied Council for Japan, Derevyanko, that the United States would maintain its military bases in Japan and Okinawa indefinitely. Only the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, with the participation of the Soviet Union and our country, will force the United States to abandon its plan to occupy Japan for a long time and its actions to establish military bases on Japanese territory.
    The conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan will force the United States to abandon its sinister plan to use Japan as an international policeman to suppress the national liberation movements of the Asian people.
    The conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan may enable U.S. monopoly capitalists to abandon their steps to restore Japan's military industry. Japanese industry is already serving the U.S. military machine. According to various reports, Mitsubishi factories are producing long-range cannons and anti-tank cannons according to U.S. orders. The Ishikawajima Konzern factory is producing light and heavy tanks and armored vehicles on a large scale.
    The conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan may also prevent U.S. monopoly capitalists from obtaining profits from colonial plunder in Japan.
    All of this is opposed by the U.S. imperialist war-mongering and aggressive clique. This is the main reason why the United States is obstructing the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

### 美国为什么阻挠对日和约的缔结？——答读者徐雪平问

　　美国为什么阻挠对日和约的缔结？
    ——答读者徐雪平问编辑同志：
    日本投降快五年了，可是对日和约还没有签订，而且不知道什么时候可以签订。中苏两国都主张迅速签订这个和约，而美帝国主义却竭力拖延阻挠，这是大家所知道的。但美国到底为什么要阻挠对日和约的签订呢？我还不十分清楚。希望你们解答一下。
   徐雪平  七月三日雪平同志：
    一九四五年七月二十六日，波茨坦公告曾经规定：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之权威与势力，必须永久铲除，盖吾人坚持非将负责之穷兵黩武主义驱出世界，则和平安全及正义之新秩序势不可能建立。”第十条又规定：“吾人无意奴役日本民族或消灭其国家，但对于战罪人犯，包括虐待吾人俘虏在内，将处以法律之裁判。日本政府必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍予以消除，言论宗教及思想自由以及对于基本人权之重视必须成立。”这就是说，日本必须根绝军国主义，必须进行彻底的民主化。然而五年来，美国政府在对日问题上，却采取了和上述公告及其他国际协定完全相反的政策。美国揭力扶植日本军国主义复活，极力镇压日本人民的民主运动，放纵日本战犯，加紧变日本为美国的殖民地和军事基地。美国曾企图超越中苏英美四国外长会议的法定步骤而直接召集远东委员会十一国会议讨论日本和约，以便于自己的操纵；这一计划受到苏联反对以后，就无限期地拖延对日和约的缔结，并企图与日本单独媾和，以便于长期占领日本。
    苏联一贯地坚持必须遵照国际协议的法定步骤，迅速地准备和缔结全面的对日和约。
    一九四七年八月苏联政府在答复美国照会中说：“苏联政府认为美国没有理由片面召开和会，而应由四强外长会议预先讨论召开草拟对日和约会议的问题，因为波茨坦会议决议建立外长会议是要它实现解决和约问题的必要准备工作。”
    一九四八年十一月六日，莫洛托夫在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命的报告中，重新指出：“苏联力主按照盟国预定的协议迅速订立对德国与日本的和约。只有那些企图无休止地延长占领的人，才不重视他们的人民的合法利益，才会回避执行上述的国际协定。”
    一九四九年五月，维辛斯基在巴黎外长会议上建议确定外长会议日期，讨论这个重要问题。并建议须有中国代表参加讨论。而美国却采取了拒绝的态度，而且蔑视波茨坦会议的决定，声明美国政府不认为外长会议“是准备对日和约的适当组织”。
    一九五○年二月十四日，中苏间订立了中苏友好同盟互助条约，其中有一条指出：
    “缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结。”
    但是，美国政府，在签订对日全面和约的问题上继续延宕和怠工。
    美国政府之所以拒绝缔结对日全面和约，是因为他们不愿意撤退自己的占领军，不愿意中止自己的变日本为美国殖民地和军事基地的罪恶计划。
    美国政府正在将日本变成侵略远东的军事战略基地。美国在日本的侵略计划，早已不是什么秘密了。麦克阿瑟今年五月四日答复盟国对日委员会苏联代表德勒维扬哥的备忘录，公然宣布美国将无限期地维持在日本和琉球的军事基地。只有苏联及我国参加的对日和约的缔结，才会迫使美国放弃长期占领日本的计划和在日本领土上建立军事基地的行动。
    对日全面和约的缔结，将迫使美国放弃其利用日本作为国际警察来压抑亚洲人民的民族解放运动的罪恶计划。
    对日全面和约的缔结，可能使美国独占资本家放弃恢复日本军事工业的步骤。现在日本工业已经在为美国的军事机器服务了。根据各方报道，三菱工厂正在依照美国的定单生产着远距离射程的大炮和攻坦克大炮。石川岛康采恩工厂在大规模地生产轻重坦克和装甲车。
    对日全面和约的缔结，也可能使美国独占资本家无法再从日本殖民掠夺中获得利益。
    这一切都是美帝国战贩侵略集团所反对的。这就是美国阻挠缔结对日全面和约的主要原因。
