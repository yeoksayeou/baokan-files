(The Mass Daily News dispatch from Jinan) Shandong Province, after the completion of land reform, has seen an unprecedented surge in the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, who are massively increasing their draught animals and farm tools, widely organizing labor mutual aid, and enthusiastically engaging in production.

From last year to the present, the province has increased its draught animals by 140,000 head, with a total of 3,410,000 head, reaching more than 70% of the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan level. With the development of production, the peasants have also greatly increased their farm tools. This spring, the province increased its waterwheels by 20,000, and the Luzhongnan District purchased an additional 10,000 plowshares.

At the same time, the province universally reorganized its labor mutual aid organizations this spring. In addition to reorganizing the original 88,476 “chahua” groups in the Luzhongnan District, the six counties of Binhai also newly developed more than 1,000 mutual aid groups. After the land reform, the broad masses of women also actively participated in agricultural production. Statistics from the Bohai District alone show that more than 387,000 women participated in sowing and seedling pulling. In Laiyang Prefecture, 90% of the women participated in field labor.

In order to improve production technology, various places in Shandong have universally established organizations to improve production technology with the help of the People's Government. The Jiaodong District established 21 agricultural promotion committees and 66 agricultural research groups. 40,000 farmers in the province have undergone agricultural technical training. Many farmers learned new methods of accumulating fertilizer such as making ash fertilizer and accumulating urine fertilizer last winter. This year, farmers in Laiyang Prefecture applied more than 200 jin of fertilizer per mu than last year. Farmers in various places also launched a well-digging and drought-prevention campaign. In the Bohai District alone, more than 58,000 wells were dug. There are now more than 600,000 wells in the province, and the number is still increasing. In the Linhe area, canals were excavated, so that farmers could regularly use well water and river water to irrigate their fields, turning dry land into paddy fields and reducing the disasters caused by drought. At the same time, superior varieties were generally selected in various places to increase crop yields. At present, 420,000 mu of Si-character cotton have been planted in the province, 720,000 jin of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes have been selected, and 12 good seed breeding and management areas have been established in Huimin and other places. In Niushan District, Linzi County, 850 of the 920 households selected seeds.

The farmers of the province also actively responded to the call of the People's Government to greatly increase the production of industrial raw materials. This spring, a total of 5,330,000 mu of cotton were planted, exceeding the highest planting area before the War of Resistance Against Japan by more than 1,670,000 mu.

After the land reform, the class consciousness of the broad masses of peasants also generally improved. Under the Kuomintang bandit army’s frenzied “key offensive” in 1947, tens of millions of peasants in the province worked hard to support the front while actively carrying out production and frugality, and finally successfully survived the three consecutive severe spring famines since 1948, and gradually restored the rural economy. Last year, the province's grain and cotton averaged 60% of a harvest. This year, farmers in various places are actively fighting against disasters such as water, drought, and insects, so that wheat has an average of 80% of a harvest. Now the broad masses of farmers in the province are working hard on summer production, striving to organize production to get rich, and striving to achieve the plan to increase cotton and grain production by 10%. (Editor's note: The Luzhongnan District, Bohai District, and Jiaodong District mentioned in the news are the original administrative divisions of Shandong Province. The province has now abolished the administrative offices, and the original 17 prefectures have been merged into 11 prefectures. The original counties, cities, special districts, and offices have been reduced to 124 counties, two offices, one prefectural city, and three provincial cities.)

　　山东完成土地改革地区
    大量添置耕畜农具  积极改进生产技术
    【济南讯】大众日报消息：山东省经过土地改革的广大农民生产情绪空前高涨，大量添置耕畜农具，广泛组织劳动互助，热烈进行生产。
    从去年到现在，全省增殖耕畜十四万头，共有三百四十一万头，达到抗日战争以前的百分之七十以上。随着生产的发展，农民们又大量地添置农具。今年春天全省增加水车两万辆，鲁中南区增购犁头一万张。
    同时，全省于今春普遍整顿了劳动互助组织，鲁中南区除整理了原有的八万八千四百七十六个插伙组外，滨海六县又新发展了一千多个互助组。土地改革后的广大妇女，亦纷纷参加农业生产。仅渤海区统计，即有三十八万七千余妇女参加了播种、拔苗工作。莱阳专区百分之九十的妇女都参加田间劳动。
    为了提高生产技术，在人民政府的帮助下，山东各地普遍建立了改进生产技术的组织。胶东区建立了二十一个农业推进委员会，六十六个农业研究小组。全省已有四万农民经过了农业技术学习。许多农民在去年冬天已学会造灰肥、积尿肥等新的积肥方法，今年莱阳专区农民较去年每亩地多施肥二百余斤。各地农民并开展了凿井防旱运动，仅渤海区即凿井五万八千多眼。现全省共有井六十余万眼，并仍在继续增加。临河地区，则开挖水渠，农民们可以经常利用井水和河水灌田，使旱地变成水田，减轻由亢旱造成的灾荒。同时，各地普遍选择优良品种，以增加作物产量。现全省已种植斯字棉四十二万亩，选种“胜利百号”甘薯七十二万斤，并在惠民等地设立了十二个良种繁殖管理区。临淄县牛山区一个乡九百二十户，即有八百五十户进行了选种。
    全省农民并积极响应人民政府的号召，大量增产工业原料。今春共种棉花五百三十三万亩，较抗日战争以前最高种植面积超过一百六十七万亩。
    经过土地改革后的广大农民，阶级觉悟亦普遍提高。在一九四七年国民党匪军疯狂的“重点进攻”下，全省数千万农民一面努力支援前线，一面积极进行生产节约，终于胜利地度过了自一九四八年起接连三个严重的春荒，并使农村经济逐渐恢复。去年全省粮棉平均有六成收成。今年各地农民又积极与水、旱、虫等灾害作斗争，使小麦平均有八成收获。现该省广大农民正紧张进行夏季生产，为组织起来生产致富，及争取实现棉粮增产一成的计划而努力。（编者按：消息中提到的鲁中南区、渤海区、胶东区等，为山东省原来区划建制，现该省已将行署撤销，原十七个专区合并为十一个专区，原有之县、市、特区、办事处等裁并为一百二十四个县，两个办事处，一个专区辖市，三个省辖市。）
