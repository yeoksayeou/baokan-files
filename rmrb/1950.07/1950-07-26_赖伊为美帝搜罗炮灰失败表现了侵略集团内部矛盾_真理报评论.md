　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th: Viktorov, in his international commentary in Pravda, commented on the failure of the United States to use Lie to request its satellite countries to send ground troops to participate in the intervention in Korea under the name of the United Nations, saying: This request produced results that its instigators clearly did not expect. They failed to recognize that voting in the United Nations on the orders of the United States is one thing, but concretely participating in the American gamble is quite another. As a result, the American imperialists, who had originally not planned to fight alone, had to console themselves mainly with "moral support." The American satellite countries are unwilling to send their troops to be used by others to serve the American imperialists. This vividly illustrates the nature of the relationship between the participants in the Anglo-American group. In this group, common aggressive goals do not exclude deep-rooted internal contradictions.

　　赖伊为美帝搜罗炮灰失败表现了侵略集团内部矛盾 
    真理报评论
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：维克托罗夫在真理报的国际述评中评论美国利用赖伊以联合国的名义要求其卫星国派遣地面部队参加干涉朝鲜的失败称：这种请求产生了它的唆使者显然没有料到的结果。他们未能认识到，奉美国的命令在联合国投票是一回事，而具体地参加美国的赌博，完全是另一回事。结果，原来毫未计划自己单独作战的美国帝国主义者，便不得不主要以“道义上的支持”来安慰自己了。美国卫星国不愿派出它们的军队，让别人利用来为美国帝国主义者服务。这生动地说明了英美集团的参加者间的关系的性质。在这一集团中，共同的侵略目的并不能排除根深蒂固的内部矛盾。
