　　Caofeidian Lighthouse Relights
    Ensuring Navigation Safety in North China
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Caofeidian Lighthouse at Dagukou is extremely important for navigation safety in North China. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government, the lighthouse was abandoned and neglected for more than ten years, and was never rebuilt. Now, under the leadership of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government, it was successfully rebuilt on July 1st, radiating its light again, indicating the direction of navigation for countless passing ships. This is a victorious beginning in our country's coastal construction work.
    Caofeidian, also known as Shaludian, is located thirty-six nautical miles east of Dagukou in the Bohai Sea (38 degrees 56 minutes 2 seconds north latitude, 118 degrees 30 minutes 45 seconds east longitude), and is the necessary route for ships traveling from Dagukou to Dalian or northward into the Liaodong Bay. In 1886, a brick lighthouse with an oil lamp was built. In 1901, it was changed to a gasoline lamp. Afterwards, it was repeatedly built, moved, and modified. In 1925, an iron tower was finally rebuilt. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the tower was destroyed. In the following ten years, many ships ran aground and were wrecked as a result. Fishermen and the navigation community regarded it as a perilous route. However, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the pseudo-navy and the pseudo-Inspectorate General of Customs shirked responsibility from each other, and it was never repaired.
    After the establishment of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government, in order to develop North China's shipping and ensure navigation safety, preparations were actively made to repair the Caofeidian Lighthouse. After half a year of preparation, four maritime affairs cadres, Ai Erge, Hu Xuewen, Zheng Gongquan, and Wang Bingzhong, formed a survey team. Under the leadership of Chief Engineer Chen Youren and Han Biao, director of the Tanggu Sub-Customs, the surveying work began on March 26. During the work, they overcame many difficulties in transportation and surveying equipment. For example, at that time, the original survey ship could not be used due to the remnant bandits blockading the sea outlets in East China, so only patrol boats could be used instead of survey ships. Furthermore, there were no shallow-water motorboats for surveying, so small motorboats of no more than ten feet long and weighing less than three tons were modified for use. In such a lack of tools and equipment, the survey team still disregarded the danger of wind and waves and carried out sixteen nautical miles of exploration work in the sea forty nautical miles from the shore. When encountering storms or huge waves, the survey team temporarily returned to the port to take shelter from the wind, but they did not disembark, and as soon as the wind subsided slightly, they immediately set out. The team experienced several dangerous sea storms, but persevered and finally completed the arduous survey task in sixty-two days. At the beginning of June, the pile driving and tower construction work began, and with the efforts of all the members of the engineering team, in just one month, on July 1st, the Caofeidian Lighthouse, which had been longed for by countless fishermen and the navigation community, was finally relit. This will play a very important role in the safety of navigation in North China. (News Secretary Cai Weizhou, General Administration of Customs)

### 曹妃甸灯塔重放光明  华北航运安全得到保障

　　曹妃甸灯塔重放光明
    华北航运安全得到保障
    【本报讯】大沽口曹妃甸灯塔，对华北航运的安全极关重要。该灯塔在国民党反动政府统治下，遗弃荒废了十余年，一直没有重建；现已在中央人民政府海关总署的领导下，于七月一日修建成功，重新放射出它的光芒，为无数的来往航船，指示着航行的方向。这是我国海岸建设工作中一个胜利的开端。
    曹妃甸又名沙垒甸，位置在渤海区大沽口外东三十六海里（北纬三八度五六分二秒，东经一一八度三○分四五秒），是由大沽驶往大连或北向入辽东湾的航行必经之路。一八八六年曾筑砖灯塔、点油灯，一九○一年改为汽油灯，其后，屡建屡移屡改，至一九二五年始改建铁塔。日伪统治时期该塔被毁坏。此后十余年，船只因此而搁浅与沉毁者甚多。渔民与航海界都视为畏途。但在国民党反动派统治时期，伪海军与伪海关总税务司署相互推诿，始终没有去修复。
    中央人民政府海关总署成立后，为开展华北航运，保障航行安全，即积极进行修复曹妃甸灯塔的准备工作。经半年筹备，海务干部艾尔格、胡学文、郑公权、王炳忠等四人组成测量队，在总工程师陈有仁和塘沽分关主任韩彪的领导下，于三月二十六日开始测量工作。在工作中，他们克服了许多交通工具和测量设备上的困难。如当时由于残匪封锁华东海口，使原有测量船不能运用，便只有用巡船代替测量船。又没有浅水汽艇供测量用，便以不过十余尺长、全重不及三吨的小汽艇改装应用。在如此缺乏工具与设备的情况下，测量队仍不顾风浪的危险，在离岸四十海里的海中，进行十六海里的测探工作。当遭遇着暴风雨或巨浪袭击的时候，测量队暂回港内避风，但他们仍不下船，等风势稍息，立即出动。该队曾经历了几次海上风雨的危险，而坚持不懈，终于以六十二天时间，完成了艰巨的测量任务。到六月初，开始了打桩建塔工作，又在工程队全体人员的努力下，不过一个月，在七月一日，使久为无数渔民与航海界所盼望的曹妃甸灯塔的重放光明，终于实现。这对华北航运的安全，将起着极重要的作用。（海关总署新闻秘书蔡渭洲）
