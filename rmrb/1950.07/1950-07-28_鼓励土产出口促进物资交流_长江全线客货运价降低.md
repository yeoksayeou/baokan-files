　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 26th: In order to encourage the export of native products and the exchange of essential goods for the people, the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau, in accordance with the spirit of "low profit and high volume," has reduced passenger and freight rates on the entire Yangtze River line starting from the 15th, and has uniformly adjusted the grading of goods. Upstream freight rates have been reduced by 14.7%, downstream freight rates have been reduced by 36.9%, and passenger rates have been reduced by 20% across the board. The freight grade has been changed from the original four grades to ten grades, and export native products and essential goods for the masses have been listed in the lower grades. Taking the Hankou-Shanghai line as an example, statistics show that the average freight rate for ten kinds of goods, including rice, tobacco leaves, soybeans, tea bricks, pig bristles, tung oil, cloth, coal, Huai salt, and edible oil, is 37% lower than in 1937, except for rice and soybeans which are slightly higher (because the freight rates for rice and soybeans were too low at that time). It is 61% lower than in 1948; 44% lower than before the adjustment; and 28% lower than before the price fluctuations in February of this year. After this price reduction, the phenomenon that transportation was affected by high freight rates in some sections or for some goods in the past has been basically eliminated.

　　鼓励土产出口促进物资交流
    长江全线客货运价降低
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】长江区航务局为鼓励土产出口及人民大众必需品的交流，根据“低利多运”的精神，已自十五日起降低长江全线客、货运价并统一调整了货物分等。货运上水运价降低了百分之十四点七，下水运价降低了百分之三十六点九，客运运价一律降低百分之二十。货运等级则由原来的四等改为十等，并把出口土产品及大众必需品分别列在较低的等级上。货运以汉申线（汉口到上海）为例，据统计：大米、烟叶、黄豆、茶砖、猪鬃、桐油、布匹、煤、淮盐、食油等十种货物的平均运价，与一九三七年比较，除大米、黄豆略高外（因为当时大米和黄豆的运价太低），其余均降低百分之三十七；与一九四八年比较，则降低百分之六十一；比调整前运价已降低百分之四十四；比今年二月间物价波动以前降低了百分之二十八。此次减价后，过去有些地段或货物因运价高而影响运输的现象已在基本上消除。
