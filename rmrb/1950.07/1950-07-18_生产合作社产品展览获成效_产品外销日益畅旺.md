[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a joint exhibition of products from various production cooperatives at Zhongshan Park at the end of May. It achieved significant results in introducing and promoting products, strengthening connections between cooperatives, and mutually exchanging technical experiences. This greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm and confidence of cooperative members, clarified future development directions, and overcame the past blindness in production.

Currently, there are 38 production cooperatives in Beijing, with a total of more than 2,000 employees. The following participated in this exhibition: 14 production cooperatives, the toothbrush and weaving and dyeing factories of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters, military dependents' factories in the Second and Sixth Districts, the cooperative of the New China Women's Federation Vocational School, and a household handicraft unit, totaling 20 entities. The exhibited products included various types of clothing, utensils, and daily necessities.

Before the exhibition, the general public knew little about the situation of the production cooperatives, and even less about the types and quality of the products of each cooperative. The exhibition played a significant promotional role in this regard and opened up broad prospects for future product exports. For example, trade departments in Northwest China, Siping, and Harbin gained a comprehensive understanding of the products of the Beijing Municipal Cooperative Headquarters' Weaving and Dyeing Factory at the exhibition and subsequently placed orders for products. The Harbin Municipal Trade Department has now signed a contract with the factory to exchange sugar for 4,000 dozen towels. Heze Middle School in Pingyuan Province and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Broadcasting Station have ordered amplifiers from the electrical appliance production cooperative. The straw rope cooperative initially thought that "taking this kind of thing out would only be for exhibition." But as a result, a lot was sold. The Tongzhou Electrical Appliance Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Tianjin Electric Saw Factory both signed contracts with the cooperative to purchase straw rope after visiting the exhibition. Furthermore, the Third District Knitting Cooperative, which had difficulty with product sales and capital turnover, was able to continue production after selling a large portion of its inventory at the exhibition. After the exhibition, the director of the cooperative, Tong Zhaoming, said excitedly, "I really didn't expect such a big harvest."

In the process of exhibiting and promoting products, each cooperative absorbed the opinions of the general public, pointing out the future production direction of improving quality and unifying trademarks and specifications.

### 生产合作社产品展览获成效  产品外销日益畅旺

　　生产合作社产品展览获成效
    产品外销日益畅旺
    【京市新闻处讯】京市供销合作总社曾于五月底在中山公园举办各生产合作社产品联合展览会，在介绍和推销产品，加强社与社间的联系及互相交流技术经验等方面，都获得显著成效，因而大大地鼓舞了社员的生产情绪与信心，并明确了今后的发展方向，克服了过去生产的盲目性。
    京市生产合作社现共有三十八个，全体职工二千余人。参加这次展览会的有：十四个生产合作社，市合作总社的牙刷、织染工厂，二区和六区的军属工厂，新中国妇女联合职业学校合作社和一个家庭手工业户，共计二十个单位。展览产品的种类有各式各样的服装衣衫、用具及日常用品。
    在没有举办展览会之前，一般市民很少了解生产合作社的情况，对各社的产品种类质量更认不清楚。展览会在这一方面起了很大的宣传作用，并且为今后产品外销开辟了广阔的前途。如西北、四平和哈尔滨等地的贸易部门，都是在展览会上才对京市合作总社织染工厂的产品有了全盘的了解，并先后订购了产品；哈尔滨市贸易部门现在已经与该厂订了以糖交换四千打毛巾的合同。平原省菏泽中学和绥远省人民广播电台都向电器生产合作社订购了扩音器。草绳合作社出产的草绳，最初都认为：“这种东西拿出去，也不过是展览罢了。”但结果卖出了很多，通州电器供销社和天津电锯厂，在参观后都与该社订了购买草绳的合同。又如三区针织社因为产品滞销、资金周转困难，在展览会上销出一大半存货后，因而又能继续生产了。会后该社主任佟兆明兴奋地说：“真没想到有这么大收获。”
    在展览和推销产品的过程中，各社吸取了广大参观群众的意见，指出了今后必须提高质量和统一商标、规格的生产方向。
