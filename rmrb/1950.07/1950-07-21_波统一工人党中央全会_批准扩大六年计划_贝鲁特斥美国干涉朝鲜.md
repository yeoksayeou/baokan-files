　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- A compilation of Polish News Agency reports: The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held its fifth plenary session in Warsaw on the 15th and 16th. The main agenda of the plenary session was to discuss the draft of the expanded Six-Year Plan.
　　Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Bierut, delivered a speech at the plenary session, strongly condemning the US imperialist aggression against Korea and the atrocities of indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean residents, and expressed the Polish people's sympathy and support for the heroic Korean people in their struggle.
　　The plenary session heard a report by Minc, a member of the Political Bureau of the United Workers' Party, on the "Six-Year Plan for Developing the Economy and Building the Socialist Foundations of Poland," and a report by Nowak on "The Issue of Cadres from the Perspective of the Tasks of the Six-Year Plan," and conducted enthusiastic discussions.
　　The plenary session approved the re-expanded Six-Year Plan and adopted the guiding principles put forward in the reports by Minc and Nowak as guiding principles for the future daily work of all Party organizations of the United Workers' Party.
　　In his closing remarks, Bierut emphasized that the Six-Year Plan is not only an economic plan but also an ideological, political, and social plan. It will fundamentally change Poland's social conditions and, with the help of the most modern technology, make Poland one of the most highly industrialized countries in Europe, in order to build the foundations of socialism. The industrialization of the country is to completely eliminate capitalist influences in all spheres of Polish life, so that Poland can make a greater contribution to the camp of peace and democracy. In this respect, the Six-Year Plan has both domestic and international significance.

    批准扩大六年计划         
    贝鲁特斥美国干涉朝鲜
    【新华社二十日讯】综合波兰通讯社消息：波兰统一工人党中央委员会于十五、十六两日在华沙举行第五次全体会议。全会的主要议程是讨论扩大的六年计划草案。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特在全会上发表演说，严斥美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和滥炸朝鲜和平居民的暴行，并表示了波兰人民对英勇斗争的朝鲜人民的同情与声援。
    全会听取了统一工人党政治局委员明兹关于“发展经济与建设波兰社会主义基础的六年计划”的报告，和诺瓦克关于“从六年计划的任务来看干部问题”的报告，并进行了热烈的讨论。
    全会批准了重新扩大的六年计划，并通过以明兹和诺瓦克的报告中所提出的指导方针，作为统一工人党全体党组织今后日常工作中的指导方针。
    贝鲁特在闭幕词中强调指出：六年计划不仅是一个经济计划，而且是一个思想的、政治的和社会的计划。它将从根本上改变波兰的社会条件，借助于最现代化的技术，使波兰成为欧洲最高度化的工业国之一，以建设起社会主义的基础。国家工业化，就是要彻底消除波兰一切生活领域中的资本主义影响，使波兰对和平民主阵营的贡献更大。就这一点上来说，六年计划是同时具有国内和国际意义的。
