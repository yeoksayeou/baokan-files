　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Office] The inventory work of warehouses in more than ten units of industrial and mining enterprises under the Beijing Municipal Industrial Bureau and Public Enterprise Company, which began in mid-May, was completed one after another in the first ten days of this month. Under the personal leadership of the person in charge and the active participation of employees, after careful research, organizational division of labor, inventory registration, valuation numbering, and other processes, the existing hundreds of thousands of pieces of equipment were subjected to a large-scale cleaning that had never been done before. The main gains of this work were the discovery of many shortcomings in the storage system: after materials were taken out of the warehouse, there was a "three no's" phenomenon of no management, no registration, and no return to the warehouse; there were no precise quotas for material requisition, and in general, the amount requisitioned exceeded the amount consumed, and there were no strict regulations for the return of surplus materials to the warehouse, resulting in great waste. The tram company discovered off-book materials worth more than 69,000 jin of millet. In addition, the warehouse equipment was simple and crude, and the materials were not stored properly, resulting in a lot of damage. The Industrial Bureau is now leading the three companies under its jurisdiction, trams, water supply, and public buses, to study a series of improvement methods from material procurement, storage, receipt, statistics to material return, and to establish a sound storage system in response to these shortcomings. Secondly, some useful but practically stagnant or surplus materials were found, and these materials will be uniformly allocated by the superior to other units for use. In addition, cleaning the warehouse is also of great help in calculating costs and machine depreciation rates.

　　十余公营企业单位清仓工作先后完竣
    【京市新闻处讯】京市工业局和公营企业公司所属工矿企业十余单位的仓库物资清理工作，自五月中旬开始，已于本月上旬先后完竣。各单位在负责人亲自领导和职工积极参加下，经过缜密研究、组织分工、清点登记、估价编号等过程，把现有数十万件器材作了从来没有过的大规模清理。这一工作的主要收获是发现了不少保管制度的缺点：器材从仓库领出后，存在着无保管、无登记、无退库的“三不管”现象；领料没有精确定额，一般的都是领用量超过消耗量，而且剩余器材应该退库的也没有严格的规定，造成很大浪费。电车公司就发现了账外物资折小米六万九千余斤。此外，库房设备因陋就简，器材储藏不善，致有不少损毁。工业局正针对这些缺点领导所属电车、自来水、公共汽车等三个公司从器材的采购，保管，领取，统计到退料，研究一系列的改进办法，树立健全的保管制度。其次，是发现了一些有用而实际呆滞或存量富裕的器材，这些器材，将由上级统一调拨给别的单位使用。另外，清理仓库对于计算成本和机器折旧率也有不少帮助。
