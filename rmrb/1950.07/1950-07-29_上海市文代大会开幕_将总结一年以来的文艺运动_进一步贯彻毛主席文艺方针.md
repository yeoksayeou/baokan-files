Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: The first Shanghai Municipal Congress of Literary and Art Workers opened on the 24th. Attending this conference were 547 representatives from various circles in Shanghai, including literature, music, fine arts, dance, drama, film, opera, and translation. The main tasks of this meeting are to summarize the literary and art movement of the past year, establish future work tasks and guidelines, and establish a unified leadership organization—the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles—to further implement Chairman Mao's policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art.

　　In his opening speech at the conference, Feng Xuefeng expressed the hope that through this conference, all literary and art workers in Shanghai would have a deeper and more thorough understanding of the direction indicated by Chairman Mao that "literature and art should serve the masses of the people," unite more broadly and firmly, and make a summary of the literary and artistic work of the past year. Chen Wangdao, Shu Tong, Pan Hannian, Shen Tilan, and others unanimously expressed the hope in their speeches that Shanghai literary and art workers would further serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, create and perform works for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and called on literary and art workers to go to the countryside and factories to work. In the afternoon, Xia Yan made a summary report on the literary and art movement in Shanghai over the past year, Ke Lan made a supplementary report, and Xiong Foxi, the principal of the Shanghai Drama School, made a report on the school's work over the past year. The conference is scheduled to close on the 29th.
