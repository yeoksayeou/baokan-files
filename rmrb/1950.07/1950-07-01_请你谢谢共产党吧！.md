　　"Please Thank the Communist Party!"
　　Wang Zhong
　　On June 20th, I took the No. 174 ordinary passenger train from Shijiazhuang to Dezhou to go home. I had come here from Hankou and had been on the train for several days. I felt quite unwell, had a high fever, a headache that made it difficult to lift my head, and felt nauseous and wanted to vomit.
　　At this time, Dr. Liu Jinchen from the Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau boarded the train from Jin County Station. I wanted to ask him to see me, but I was afraid that he would not treat me (because during the Kuomintang rule, no one cared if you got sick on the train). I didn't say anything at the time. But before the train had gone one stop, he saw that I was sick and immediately came to me, very kindly diagnosed me, checked my temperature, and asked me in detail about the cause of my illness. After the diagnosis, he said it was a cold. I was relieved. He gave me medicine and even went to a vendor to get me a bowl of boiled water to drink the medicine. I was so moved that I couldn't speak. I wanted to give him money. He resolutely refused, and said to me: "I am a doctor at the Railway Bureau Hospital, and I am not only responsible for ensuring the health of railway workers, but also for treating passengers on the train!" I thanked him. But he said loudly: "Please don't thank me. Without the Communist Party, how could I be like this? Please thank the Communist Party!"

　　“请你谢谢共产党吧！”
    王忠
    六月二十日我乘石家庄到德州的一七四次普通客车回家。我从汉口来到这里，已经坐了几天车，身体颇感不适，发烧很厉害，头也痛得抬不起来，恶心地光想吐。
    这时候有一位太原铁路局石家庄铁路医院刘晋臣大夫从晋县车站上车。我想请他给我看看病，但又怕人家不给看，（因为在国民党统治时期，在火车上生病，是谁也不管的。）当时就没有说出来。但是车还没有走过一站地，他看见我有病，就马上到我跟前，很亲切地给我诊断、查体温，详细的问我发病的原因。诊断的结果，他说是感冒。我才放了心。他给了我药，还到小贩那里给我端来了一碗开水，让我把药喝下去。我心里真感动得说不出话来。我要给他钱。他坚决不要，并且对我说：“我是铁路局医院的大夫，不但要保证铁路工人的健康，就是车上的客人我们也有医治的责任！”我就谢谢他。可是他高声地说：“请你不要谢我。没有共产党，我那能这样？请你谢谢共产党吧！”
