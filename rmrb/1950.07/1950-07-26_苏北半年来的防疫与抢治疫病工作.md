　　Disease Prevention and Treatment in Northern Jiangsu in the Past Six Months
    Huang Zhijian
    In December of last year, the Northern Jiangsu District convened the First Health Work Conference, which determined that the focus for the first half of this year would be on disease prevention and treatment. In terms of disease prevention, the Administrative Office's Health Bureau purchased a large quantity of smallpox vaccine and cholera-typhoid vaccine in advance, and distributed them to various special districts for use. According to preliminary statistics, 768,816 people in the region were vaccinated against smallpox this spring. During the vaccination process, many areas carried out in-depth disease prevention publicity work; at the same time, they united and organized local medical personnel. For example, the Huaiyin Special District established nine county medical associations and 112 district medical associations, organizing more than 3,800 doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine, becoming a powerful force in disease prevention work. Smallpox was discovered in Qidong, Haimen, Huai'an and other counties. Under the prevention and treatment efforts of doctors of Chinese and Western medicine organized by the county people's hospitals, the spread of the epidemic was curbed. On the basis of the vaccination work, summer disease prevention work is now being carried out in various places. For example, the Huaiyin Special District has administered preventive injections to more than 45,000 people in the disaster area; the urban area of Yancheng injected one-fourth of the local total population in four days.
    Northern Jiangsu has suffered from the long-term ravages of the reactionaries, and various endemic diseases are widespread. According to preliminary estimates from the Huaiyin and Yancheng Special Districts, there are more than 140,000 cases of Kala-azar; according to statistics from the Huaiyin, Nantong, Taizhou, and Yancheng Special Districts, there are more than 35,000 cases of syphilis; parasitic diseases are more common in the Yancheng Special District, with more than 16,000 patients. Other diseases and epidemics are also frequently found in various places, especially in disaster areas, where the number is even greater. In order to prevent and rescue disease disasters, in addition to the epidemic prevention team sent by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government to work in the disaster area, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office formed a medical and disease prevention team, and each special district and county also organized nine epidemic prevention teams, 33 epidemic prevention stations, and 23 epidemic prevention groups, going deep into the disaster area to cooperate with local doctors in their work. The Administrative Office's Health Bureau also purchased 100,500 ampules of "Cole Stibium" and distributed them to the Huaiyin and Yancheng Special Districts and the medical and disease prevention teams for key experimental treatment of Kala-azar. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 4,443 Kala-azar patients have been cured in various places in five months. In the Huaiyin Special District, the spread of Kala-azar has stopped; at the same time, an investigation of Kala-azar was carried out, and a central prevention and treatment center was established, planning to completely eliminate Kala-azar after autumn. For the diseases of the disaster victims, Huai'an County allocated 20,000 catties of relief grain and concentrated 123 seriously ill disaster victims in three places for treatment, saving manpower and material resources, and shortening the recovery process. Liandong County conducted research on the food of the disaster victims and publicized the methods of eating to the masses. The Taizhou Special District organized medical teams to treat the disaster area, concentrating patients with minor illnesses in fixed locations every day for centralized diagnosis and treatment, while doctors went to the homes of patients with serious illnesses for diagnosis and treatment. They also grasped practical examples to educate the masses and instilled common sense of disease prevention. The Huaiyin Special District comprehensively organized medical associations, mobilized local doctors to rescue patients, and organized mobile medical teams as mobile forces. In total, 75,257 disaster victims have been treated in Northern Jiangsu in the past six months.
    At the same time, in coordination with the Yi River diversion, Yangtze River embankment repair, Grand Canal embankment and sea embankment projects, each special district organized medical personnel to treat diseases for the vast number of migrant workers and carry out vaccination, delousing, drinking water disinfection and health publicity and education work, which improved the health knowledge of the migrant workers and reduced their diseases.
    In addition, individual counties in the Taizhou and Yancheng Special Districts also introduced 66 doctors with sluggish business and unemployed doctors to rural areas lacking doctors to practice medicine, adjusting the medical force; the two special districts also tried to run old midwifery training classes and midwife training classes to create experience for improving maternal and child health work in the future.
    In carrying out the above work, there are still many shortcomings in various places. The publicity and education work on health and disease prevention is not yet universal. In the disease treatment work, there is still a lack of correct investigation, and the condition of the disease cannot be well grasped. The reports of the epidemic situation are sometimes not timely, incorrect, or even not reported. The inspection and supervision in health work are not done enough. For example, in some areas, individual local doctors vaccinated public vaccines and charged fees themselves, or vaccinated the masses with expired vaccines; some areas did not complete the vaccination work. These all need to be further improved.

### 苏北半年来的防疫与抢治疫病工作

　　苏北半年来的防疫与抢治疫病工作
    黄志坚
    去年十二月，苏北区召开了第一届卫生工作会议，确定今年上半年以防疫与抢治疫病为主。在防疫工作方面，行署卫生局事先购办了大批牛痘苗与霍乱伤寒疫苗，分发各专区应用。据初步统计，全区在今春有七十六万八千八百十六人接种了牛痘。在进行种痘时，许多地区进行了深入的防疫宣传工作；同时团结组织了地方医务人员。如淮阴专区成立了九个县医协会，一百十二个区医协会，组织了中西医三千八百余人，成为防疫工作中一支强大力量。启东、海门、淮安等县曾发现天花，在县人民医院组织中西医防治下，遏止了疫病的蔓延。在种痘工作的基础上，现各地正开展夏季防疫工作，如淮阴专区已在灾区为四万五千余人施行了预防注射；盐城城区在四天中，就注射了当地总人口的四分之一。
    苏北境内曾遭受反动派的长期蹂躏，多种地方病普遍流行。据淮阴、盐城两专区初步估计，黑热病患者达十四万人以上；据淮阴、南通、泰州、盐城四专区统计，患梅毒者达三万五千余人；寄生虫病在盐城专区比较多，有患者一万六千余人。其他病疫各地亦常发现，特别是在灾区，为数更多。为了预防与抢救病灾，除中央人民政府卫生部派有防疫队到达灾区工作外，苏北行署组成了医防队，各专、县亦分别组织了防疫队九个、防疫站三十三处，防疫小组二十三个，深入灾区配合当地医生展开工作。行署卫生局并购置了十万零五千支“可乐锑”，分发淮阴、盐城两专区与医防队，作黑热病的重点试验治疗。据不完全统计，五个月中各地共治好了黑热病患者四千四百四十三人。在淮阴专区，黑热病已停止了发展；同时进行了黑热病的调查工作，设立了中心防治所，计划在秋后全部扑灭黑热病。对于灾民的疾病，淮安县拨出了救济粮两万斤，把重病灾民一百二十三人分三处集中治疗，节省了人力物力，并缩短了治愈的过程。涟东县对灾民食物进行了研究，向群众宣传吃的方法。泰州专区组织了医疗小组到灾区治疗，将轻病患者每天集中在固定地点集中诊治，重病患者则由医生赴病户诊疗。并抓紧实际事例教育群众，灌输防疫常识。淮阴专区全面组织了医协会，发动地方医生抢救病患，又组织巡回医疗队作机动力量。总计全苏北半年中共治疗了灾民病者达七万五千二百五十七人。
    同时，各专区在配合导沂、修长江堤、运河堤和海堤工程中，分别组织了医务人员为广大的民工治疗疾病并进行种痘、灭虱、饮水消毒与卫生宣传教育工作，提高了民工的卫生常识，减少了民工的疾病。
    此外，泰州、盐城两专区的个别县，还介绍了六十六名营业清淡的医生与失业医生到缺乏医生的农村中去营业，调剂了医疗力量；两专区又试办了旧接产妇训练班和助产士训练班，以为今后改进妇婴卫生工作创造经验。
    在进行上述工作中，各地还有不少缺点。卫生防疫的宣传教育工作还不够普遍，在病疗工作中，还缺乏正确的调查，对病情不能很好掌握，下面报告疫情有的不及时、不正确，甚至不报。在卫生工作中的检查、督促作得不够，如有的地区曾有个别地方医生种公家痘苗，自己收费，或者拿过了期的痘苗给群众接种；有的地区种痘工作没有完成任务。这些，都待进一步加以改进。
