【Our Newspaper News】The "New Quyi Experimental Mobile Group," organized by the Preparatory Committee of the China Quyi Improvement Association, after conducting anti-American aggression propaganda activities in Beijing in response to the call of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has gone to the Beijing-Hankou Railway line to continue its propaganda.

　　On the afternoon of July 19, the group performed propaganda at Zhongshan Park. Using programs such as Beijing Rhyme, West River Drum, and Single String, and exhibiting twenty-six large poster paintings of "Chiang Kai-shek's Life of Sin," they exposed to the masses that American imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and encouraged the masses to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the Korean people. The "New Quyi Group's" single string and Beijing rhyme classes continued their propaganda at the East Station of this city on July 20, with Wang Xiuying singing "Fight Taiwan," Li Decheng singing "Good Husband and Wife," Kou Delin singing "Liberate Hainan Island," and the technical class performing programs such as the diabolo, three knives, and collective martial arts, which were warmly welcomed by the audience. On the evening of the 20th, the group participated in a mass meeting held by the Youth Art Theater against American aggression, performing items such as "Diabolo" and "Fight Taiwan." On the afternoon of the 20th, the technical class of the group departed for the Beijing-Hankou line to carry out propaganda against American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The mobile group will also vigorously promote the reform movement of artists in various places.
