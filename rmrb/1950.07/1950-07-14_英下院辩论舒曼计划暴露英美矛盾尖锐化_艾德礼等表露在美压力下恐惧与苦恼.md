　　British House of Commons Debate on the Schuman Plan Reveals Intensified Anglo-American Contradictions
    Attlee and Others Express Fear and Distress Under American Pressure
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th—The debate in the British House of Commons from June 26th to 28th regarding the British government's policy on the Schuman Plan further exposed the irreconcilable contradictions between the United States and Britain.
    The focus of the House of Commons debate was a joint amendment to the Labour government proposed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. The amendment requested that Britain participate in the Schuman Plan negotiations while retaining freedom of action. This amendment itself indicated that the Labour and Conservative parties, both serving the British big bourgeoisie, did not actually have any serious differences regarding their attitude towards the Schuman Plan. Therefore, in the final vote of confidence in the House of Commons, the Labour government did not encounter fierce opposition and won a majority. What is important is that the speeches of the heads of the Labour government during the debate abandoned their past coyness and directly pointed out the sinister intention of the Schuman Plan to swallow up the British coal and steel industries.
    According to British Information Services, British Prime Minister Attlee plainly declared in his reply in the House of Commons that Britain could not participate in the Schuman Plan "because this plan requires us to transfer our two basic interests (coal and steel) to a group of people appointed by the relevant governments, who are not responsible to the governments, but only pass resolutions by a majority, and these resolutions are binding on the countries participating in the plan.” Attlee said: “We do not want to accept a principle that transfers our most vital economic power to an institution that is completely undemocratic and not accountable to anyone.” Attlee called this institution a "supra-national institution."
    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps spoke even more bluntly in the House of Commons when explaining the British government's policy. Cripps called participating in the Schuman Plan negotiations a kind of "adventure," and "staking a large part, or even all, of the British economy on a single throw."
    Cripps emphasized that Britain's coal production is about half of the total production in Western Europe, and its steel production is about one-third. "Therefore, in this plan, we have a greater economic stake than any other country." Cripps expressed Britain's deep fear of the proposed high-level joint management organization for coal and steel in Western Europe under the Schuman proposal. He said: "The proposed supra-national institution would cause the entire coal and steel center to completely cease operations without any social and political responsibility. Should the issue of economic planning be left to such an institution to guide and advise? If Britain's coal and steel market outside Europe shrinks because of the supra-national institution, how can Britain continue to obtain imports of its basic necessities? And this import is something that the supra-national institution will not care about.” Cripps finally declared: "Participating in a political alliance limited to Western European countries is incompatible with our connection with the Commonwealth, with our obligations as a member of the Atlantic community, or with our status as a world power."
    The speeches of Attlee and Cripps once again revealed the fear and distress of the British bourgeoisie in the face of the increasingly strong pressure from the United States, and also revealed their resistance and struggle against the United States in order to maintain their survival. Even the Times pointed out: "The speeches in this House of Commons debate are more important to British voters and foreigners than holding a decisive vote. The Anglo-French coal and steel negotiations have raised serious questions about Britain's various policies towards Europe and the world."

### 英下院辩论舒曼计划暴露英美矛盾尖锐化  艾德礼等表露在美压力下恐惧与苦恼

　　英下院辩论舒曼计划暴露英美矛盾尖锐化
    艾德礼等表露在美压力下恐惧与苦恼
    【新华社七日讯】英国下院在六月二十六日至二十八日就英国政府对舒曼计划的政策所进行的辩论，进一步暴露了美英间不可调和的矛盾。
    下院辩论的中心是保守党与自由党提出的对工党政府的联合修正案。该修正案要求英国在保留行动自由的条件下，参加舒曼计划的谈判。这个修正案本身就表示了同样为英国大资产阶级服务的工党与保守党，实际上对舒曼计划的态度并没有什么严重的分歧。因此，在下院最后举行信任投票时，工党政府并没有遭到剧烈的反对而赢得了多数票。重要的是：工党政府首脑人物在辩论时的发言，已经放弃了过去的忸怩作态，而直率地指出了舒曼计划企图吞并英国煤钢工业的凶恶目的。
    据英国新闻处消息：英首相艾德礼在下院答辩时明白宣称：英国不能参加舒曼计划，“因为这个计划需要我们把我国的两项基本利益（煤钢），移交给一群各有关政府委派的人员，这些人员却又不向各国政府负责，仅凭多数通过决议，而这些决议对于各参加计划的国家又是有命令性的”。艾德礼说：“我们不想接受这样一个原则，即把我国最切身攸关的经济力量让渡予一个完全不民主，而且不向任何人负责的机构。”艾德礼把这个机构称为“超国家机构”。
    英财相克利浦斯在下院阐释英国政府的政策时说得更加露骨。克利浦斯把参加舒曼计划的谈判称为是一种“冒险”，是把“英国经济的主要部分，甚至可说是全部来作孤注一掷”。
    克利浦斯着重指出：英国煤产量约为西欧总产量的一半，而钢产量约为三分之一。“因此，在这个计划里，我们有着比其他任何国家更大的经济上的利害关系。”克利浦斯表示英国对舒曼建议的西欧煤钢高级共管机构怀有深刻的恐惧。他说：“建议中的超国家机构，会引起整个煤矿和钢业中心完全停止工作，而不负任何社会和政治的责任，经济计划的问题是不是应该留给这样的一个机构来指导和建议呢？假如因为超国家机构而使英国在欧洲以外的煤钢市场缩小了，英国如何还能继续取得其基本必需物资的入口呢？而这种入口是超国家机构所不会关心的。”克利浦斯最后宣称：“参加了仅限于西欧国家的政治联盟，对于我们和联邦的连系，对于我们作为大西洋社会一员的义务，或者对于我们作为世界强国的地位，都是不相容的。”
    艾德礼和克利浦斯的发言，再次表露了英国资产阶级在美国日益强横的压力面前的恐惧与苦恼，也表露了它们将为维持其生存而对美国进行抵抗挣扎。连泰晤士报也指出：“这次下院辩论中的发言，对于英国选民和外国人士，比举行一次决定性的投票还重要。英法煤钢谈判引起了有关英国对欧洲及世界各种政策的严重问题。”
