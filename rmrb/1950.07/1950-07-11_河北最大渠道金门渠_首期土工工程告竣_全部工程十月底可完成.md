Hebei's Largest Canal, Jinmen Canal
    First Phase of Earthwork Completed
    Entire Project Expected to Finish by End of October
    [Report from this newspaper] The Jinmen Canal, Hebei Province's largest canal, has seen the successful completion of its first phase of earthwork on June 4th, thanks to the efforts of over 11,000 military personnel, laborers, and civilian workers since construction began on April 2nd. Currently, construction work and the excavation of small branch canals are underway. The entire project is anticipated to be completed by the end of October this year. The canal, located in the middle reaches of the Yongding River between Gu'an, Yongqing, and Ba Counties, stretches for 84 kilometers. It includes one main canal, starting from the Jinmen Sluice on the Yongding River, passing through Zhuo County to Nanma Village in Gu'an County, with a length of 16.319 kilometers; one eastern canal, starting from Nanma Village (connecting to the end of the main canal) to Dongxixiaqi Village in Yongqing County, with a length of 24.500 kilometers; five branch canals and one distributary canal, with a total length of approximately 43.246 kilometers. Existing rivers such as the Pinniu River, Taiping River, and Huangjia River are utilized as drainage routes to discharge rainwater and tailwater from the canal. Construction work includes: one inlet sluice (utilizing the existing Jinmen Sluice), six diversion sluices, five drop structures, six tailwater sluices, twenty-five bridges, forty-three control gates for branch canals, and twenty-nine culverts. The engineering plan and survey work for the canal were completed between September and October of last year. Approved by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government and the Hebei Provincial People's Government, a water conservancy loan of 11.4 million *jin* of millet was allocated as project expenses. The canal is being constructed under the auspices of the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, with the official establishment of the Jinmen Canal Engineering Office in March of this year. The first phase of earthwork involved a total of 391,210 workdays, completing 1,220,047 cubic meters of earthwork. During construction, work relief programs were combined, resolving the livelihood difficulties of tens of thousands of disaster victims. The complete completion of the first phase of the project will bring irrigation benefits to 350,000 *mu* of land, increasing grain production by 25 million *jin* of millet annually, with annual gains exceeding the construction cost by more than onefold.

　　河北最大渠道金门渠
    首期土工工程告竣
    全部工程十月底可完成
    【本报讯】河北省规模最大的渠道——金门渠，从四月二日开始动工以来，经过一万一千多名军工、民工努力兴修，第一期土工工程已于六月四日胜利完成，现正进行建筑工程和开挖细小支渠。全部工程预计在今年十月底即可竣工。该渠在永定河中游固安、永清、霸县之间，长达八十四公里。计有总干渠一道，自永定河金门闸起，经涿县至固安县南马村，长一六点三一九公里；东干渠一道，自南马村（接总干渠尾）起至永清县东西下七村，长二四点五○○公里；支渠五道，分渠一道，总长约四三点二四六公里。利用旧有的牝牛河、太平河、黄家河等作为泄水路，排泄雨水及渠尾的退水。建筑工程计有：进水闸一座（利用旧有金门闸），分水闸六座，跌水五座，退水闸六座，桥梁二十五座，支分渠斗门四十三个，涵洞二十九座。该渠的工程计划和查勘测量工作，于去年九、十月间完成；经中央人民政府水利部和河北省人民政府批准，并拨给水利贷款小米一千一百四十万市斤，作为工程费用。该渠由河北省水利局主持兴修，在今年三月正式成立了金门渠工程处。第一期土工并共用工三十九万一千二百一十个，完成土方一百二十二万四十七公方。施工时，结合以工代赈，使数万灾民生活困难得到解决。第一期工程的全部完成，将使三十五万亩地得到灌溉利益，每年增产粮食折米二千五百万斤，一年所得即超过建筑费的一倍以上。
