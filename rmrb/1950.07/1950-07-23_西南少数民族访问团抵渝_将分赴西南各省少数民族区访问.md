　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 21st: The Southwestern Minority Nationalities Visiting Group, consisting of over 120 people, which departed from the capital on the 2nd of this month, arrived in Chongqing by ship from Hankou on the 18th. Li Da, Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military Region, Zhang Ziyi, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Sun Kebaton, Tibetan representative and member of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee staying in Chongqing, Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Chongqing, and others went to the dock to welcome them. On the evening of the 19th, the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, and the Southwest Military Region jointly held a welcome reception. Chairman Liu Bocheng delivered a welcome speech. He said: The Central People's Government, in accordance with the spirit of the nationality policy stipulated in the Common Program, organized a visiting group to visit the various minority nationalities in the Southwest Region, which shows that the Central People's Government is determined to eliminate the influence of the Great Han chauvinism policy implemented by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past to oppress minority nationalities. Since the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army marched north to resist Japan, the minority nationalities in the Southwest have contributed greatly to the Chinese revolution. The visit of the visiting group to the Southwest to connect with the fraternal nationalities will greatly help strengthen national unity and build the Southwest. Then, Liu Geping, head of the visiting group, spoke. He said: We have brought the care of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to the fraternal nationalities in the Southwest, and we must also bring the enthusiasm of the fraternal nationalities in supporting Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government back to the capital. At the end of the evening party, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee presented flowers to the visiting group to express their respect.
　　Chongqing Xinhua Daily and Ta Kung Pao both published commentaries on the 19th, expressing a warm welcome to the arrival of the visiting group.
　　The group will stay in Chongqing for a short time and then go to the minority nationality areas in the southwestern provinces for visits.
