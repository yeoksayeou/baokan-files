    [Our Newspaper] The flood season has arrived nationwide, and various regions are successively conducting intense flood prevention work.

    In the Pearl River and Min River basins, continuous rain has fallen since June 19th, causing river levels to rise generally. By June 26th, water levels at Gaoyao, Qingyuan, and Sanshui stations in the Pearl River basin, and Fuzhou station in the Min River basin, had exceeded the prescribed danger levels, and began to gradually decrease from the 27th onward. In Hunan Province, the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng rivers reached their highest water levels around the Dragon Boat Festival, approaching the highest water levels in previous years. In the Xiang River basin near Xiangtan County, the water level reached 37 meters on June 19th (Dragon Boat Festival), only about one meter below the highest water level in previous years. In the Yangtze River basin, rainfall became widespread on June 23rd. At Chongqing station in the upper reaches, the water level rose five meters within a week (June 24th to 30th). At Yichang station, the water level rose nearly one meter on the 23rd. In the lower reaches, the water levels at Jiujiang, Anqing, Nanjing, and Xiangyang on the Han River are all rising. In the Huai River basin, there were heavy rains near Bengbu and Zhengyangguan at the end of June, and river levels are expected to rise within days. In North China, the Yongding River experienced a sharp rise in water levels on June 30th. At Guanting station in the upper reaches, the water level rose to 445.18 meters (based on the Dagu sea level), and at Lugou Bridge in the lower reaches, the water level rose to 63.22 meters on July 1st, with a flow rate of 1,000 cubic meters per second, nearly doubling the maximum flow rate of last year.

    In order to fight the floods and ensure that 70 million mu of the 100 million mu of farmland flooded last year are spared from flooding, flood prevention meetings have been held successively across the country to arrange flood prevention work. From the central government down to the county and district levels, flood prevention headquarters have been established, headed by the main responsible personnel from the government, military organs, and water conservancy departments. The Central Flood Control Headquarters was established in Beijing on June 3rd. From June 9th to 28th, the Central-South, East China, and Northeast regions, as well as the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, and the Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Tianjin Flood Control Headquarters, were successively established. Various lower-level flood prevention organizations have also been formed or are being organized. All levels of water conservancy organizations across the country, except for areas without flood prevention tasks, have been incorporated into the flood prevention organizational system.

    After the National Flood Prevention Conference, various regions immediately began to utilize existing hydrological measurement stations to establish flood reporting networks, in order to closely connect the upper and lower reaches of each river and grasp changes in water conditions. As of now, there are a total of 213 flood reporting stations nationwide using telecommunications, with 66 flood reporting stations equipped with radio stations, of which 61 stations report directly to the Central Flood Control Headquarters. Forty-five stations have already started flood reporting work, and the remaining stations are expected to begin flood reporting in early July.

    In order to accurately understand the dike conditions in various regions, so as to repair dangerous works and eliminate hidden dangers, the Central Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on a major inspection of dikes on June 13th. The East China Military and Political Committee, the Northeast Flood Control Headquarters, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission have also successively instructed various regions to earnestly inspect dikes, and ordered the flood control headquarters of each province, special district, and county to complete the dike inspection on schedule and make all preparations for flood prevention work. The Hebei Flood Control Headquarters organized inspection teams to inspect dikes in various rivers. After the Yongding River rose, the River Affairs Bureau and relevant special counties immediately took action. On the 200-kilometer-long section of the river above Lianggezhuang, cadres and the masses from the three special districts of Tong, Jin, and Bao, and seven counties, launched a fierce and intense battle against the flood. Hubei, Hunan, northern Anhui, southern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other places are also carrying out dike inspections and repairs, and are actively preparing for flood prevention.

　　汛期已到各河先后涨水
    各地开始紧张防汛
    中央防汛指挥部指示严密检查堤防
    【本报讯】全国范围内的汛期已临，各地相继进行紧张的防汛工作。
    珠江、闽江流域，自六月十九日起，连日霪雨，河水普遍上涨。至六月二十六日，珠江流域的高要、清远、三水和闽江流域的福州等站，水位超过规定危险水位，二十七日起始逐渐下降。湖南省湘、资、沅、沣四水，在端午节前后，最高水位已接近历年最高水位。湘江流域在湘潭县附近一带，六月十九日（端午节）水位已达三十七公尺，仅低于历年最高水位一公尺左右。长江流域，自六月二十三日起，普遍降雨，上游重庆站一周内（六月二十四日至三十日）上涨五公尺。宜昌站二十三日上涨近一公尺。下游九江、安庆、南京以及汉水的襄阳等站，江水均呈上涨。淮河流域的蚌埠、正阳关间，六月末均有暴雨，日内河水亦将上涨。华北之永定河，六月三十日河水猛涨，上游官厅站曾涨至四百四十五点一八公尺（以大沽海平面为计算标准），下游卢沟桥，七月一日涨至六十三点二二公尺，流量达一千秒公方，超过去年最大流量将近一倍。
    为了向洪水展开搏斗，确保去年被淹的一亿亩耕地中的七千万亩免受水患，全国各地已先后召开防汛会议，布置防汛工作。从中央以至县区，均以政府、军事机关、水利部门等主要负责人员为首，建立了各级防汛指挥部。中央防汛总指挥部于六月三日在京成立。从六月九日至二十八日，中南、华东、东北各区与黄河等防汛总指挥部及河北、平原、山东、山西、绥远、天津市等防汛指挥部，相继成立。各中下级防汛机构亦先后组成或正在组织中。全国各级水利机构，除没有防汛任务的地区外，均已转入防汛组织体系。
    全国防汛会议后，各地即开始利用原有的水文测量站，建立报汛网，以密切各河上下游联系，掌握水情变化。截至目前为止，全国利用电讯的报汛站，共达二百一十三个，装设电台的报汛站六十六个，其中直接向中央防汛总指挥部报汛的有六十一站。已有四十五个站开始报汛工作，其余各站可在七月上旬开始报汛。
    为了详确地了解各地堤防情况，以便修整险工，肃清隐患，中央防汛总指挥部于六月十三日发布了关于堤防大检查的指示。华东军政委员会、东北防汛总指挥部、黄河水利委员会亦先后指示各地，要求切实检查堤防，限令各省、各专区、各县防汛指挥部定期完成堤防检查，并作好一切防汛准备工作。河北防汛指挥部，组织了检查组，分赴各河道检查堤防。永定河水涨后，河务局及各有关专县立即行动起来。在梁各庄以上全长二百公里的河段上，通、津、保三个专区、七个县的干部群众，与洪水展开了激烈紧张的战斗。湖北、湖南、皖北、皖南、苏北、浙江等地，亦正在进行堤防检查和培修工作，积极准备防汛。
