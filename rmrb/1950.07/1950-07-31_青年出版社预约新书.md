Youth Publishing House Pre-Publication Bookings
    The Youth Publishing House will soon publish "Factory Cadre Textbook, Book 1 (Draft)" and "Talks on the Constitution of the China New Democratic Youth League (Draft)" on August 15th. These two books are good reading materials for团委 (League Committees) to use as teaching materials for League members or for League members to study on their own. In order to give preferential treatment to readers, the publishing house has specifically decided to handle pre-publication bookings from August 1st to August 10th. Individual bookings will receive a 20% discount, and团委 (League Committees) and团支部 (League Branches) making collective bookings of 10 or more copies of each title at a time will receive a 25% discount. In addition to handling local bookings at the publishing house (Wangfujing Avenue), business offices in Shanghai, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Shenyang can also handle bookings.
