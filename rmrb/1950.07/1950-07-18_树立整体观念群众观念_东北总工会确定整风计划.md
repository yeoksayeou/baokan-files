    Establish an Overall Perspective and a Mass Perspective
    Northeast Federation of Trade Unions Establishes Rectification Plan
    The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions held two joint meetings of department heads on June 27th and July 4th to study the issue of rectification. The meetings determined that the rectification work of the trade union system should be based on the Northeast's trade union work outline for the second half of this year, reading rectification documents, and inspecting and summarizing the leadership style of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions at all levels, as well as the work of each department and individual. The goal is to establish an overall perspective and a mass perspective among cadres through this rectification, thoroughly overcome certain narrow-minded ideas in the workers' movement, confrontational sentiments with the administration, and work styles such as coercive orders, tailism, and bureaucracy. The rectification steps should be from top to bottom, first rectifying the leading cadres above the department heads of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and then rectifying the various industries and provincial and municipal federations of trade unions, as well as the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions' organs, to fully展开 the rectification study of the trade union system. General grassroots cadres will be trained in rotation. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has entered the preparation phase from July 5th.

    树立整体观念群众观念
    东北总工会确定整风计划
    东北总工会于六月二十七日和七月四日召开了两次部长联席会议，研究整风问题。会议确定工会系统的整风工作，要根据东北今年下半年工会工作大纲，阅读整风文件，检查与总结东北总工会及各级工会的领导作风，及各部门各个人的工作。作到经过此次整风，切实在干部中建立起整体观念与群众观念，彻底克服工人运动中的某些狭隘思想，与行政对立情绪，以及强迫命令、尾巴主义、官僚主义等作风。整风步骤应为自上而下，先整东北总工会部长以上领导干部，然后整各产业与各省、市总工会及东北总工会机关，全面展开工会系统的整风学习。对一般基层干部采取轮训办法。七月五日起东总已进入准备阶段。
