Xinhua News Agency, July 13th, dispatch from TASS on the 11th: The Labor Newspaper published an editorial titled "Actively Support the Korean People," stating: The week of active support for the Korean people, organized worldwide under the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), began on July 10th. In its letter to the working people of all countries, the WFTU suggested that its affiliated organizations immediately take all necessary actions as much as possible to thwart the heinous schemes of the American warmongers. The WFTU also suggested organizing mass rallies and demonstrations to demand the immediate withdrawal of American armed forces from Korea. The Labor Newspaper pointed out that the insidious and vicious plans of the imperialists have been declared a failure under the increasingly fierce blows of the North Korean army. The Lee Seung-man regime, which betrayed the nation and can only exist by relying on American bayonets, is collapsing. The just actions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have received the unanimous support of the entire people, as well as the sympathy of all freedom-loving and progressive humanity.
    The Labor Newspaper concluded: The WFTU unites more than 78 million workers. The worldwide movement it is now carrying out will undoubtedly win a broad response from all countries in the world and will lead to a further increase in the strength of the world's peace forces.

　　“积极声援朝鲜人民”
    苏联劳动报社论
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社十一日讯：劳动报以《积极声援朝鲜人民》为题发表社论称：全世界在世界工联号召下组织的积极声援朝鲜人民周已于七月十日开始。世界工联在其告世界各国劳动人民书中，建议其所属各组织立即尽可能的采取一切必要的行动，以挫败美国战争贩子穷凶极恶的计谋。世界工联并建议组织群众大会与示威游行，要求美国武装部队立即从朝鲜撤退。劳动报指出：帝国主义者阴险狠毒的计划，已在北朝鲜军队越来越猛的打击之下宣告失败。只有倚靠美国的刺刀才能存在的出卖民族的李承晚政权，正在土崩瓦解。而朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的正义行为，却得到了全体人民一致的支持，以及一切爱好自由的进步人类的同情。
    劳动报在结语中称：世界工联团结了七千八百万以上的职工。现在它所进行的世界规模的运动，无疑将赢得世界各国广泛的响应，并将导致世界和平力量更进一步的增长。
