[News Dispatch from Beijing Municipal News Agency] In order to implement the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Relief to Unemployed Workers" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the Beijing Municipal Unemployed Workers Relief Committee has decided to begin the registration of unemployed workers in the city starting on the 24th of this month, and has stipulated specific registration measures.

　　(1) Scope of Registration: According to Article 3 of the "Provisional Measures for Relief to Unemployed Workers" promulgated by the Central Government, the principle is temporarily limited to workers and staff who originally worked in state-owned and private industrial and commercial enterprises and dock transportation businesses in the city, as well as personnel engaged in cultural, artistic, and educational undertakings, who became unemployed after liberation and currently have no work or other income; employees who became unemployed before liberation may also register if they have special difficulties and request relief.

　　(2) Registration Procedures: Unemployed employees within the above scope can obtain two copies of the registration form and one copy of the police station certificate from the district registration office in their district. After filling out the registration form according to the instructions on the form (instructions for filling out the form), they should find the labor union organization of the factory, store, school, etc., where they originally worked (if there is no labor union organization, the administrative side or the capitalists can do it), and sign and seal the "Opinions of the Certifier" column on the registration form. If the original enterprise has been closed for a long time and it is impossible to obtain a certificate, the certification of two workers currently employed is required (workers currently employed must obtain certification from their current factory, store, or school), and the public security police station in the place of residence must affix a seal on the certificate. Then take the completed registration form and certificate to the district registration office for registration. After registration, the district registration office will submit it to the Municipal Unemployed Workers Relief Committee for review. If deemed qualified, a registration certificate will be issued.
