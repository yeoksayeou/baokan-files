(Shanghai News) The Liberation Daily reports: Since May, the Shanghai market has begun to reverse the sales slump of March and April, gradually showing signs of activity. The volume of commodity transactions and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas have both increased. This reflects the return of the people's real purchasing power to the market.

Since May, the wholesale transaction volume index of eight major commodities has increased by 10% compared to April, and in the first half of June, it increased by 27.6% compared to April. Among them, the transaction volumes of rice and cotton cloth both broke the highest records since the second half of March. The transaction volume of cotton yarn also increased significantly in May, increasing by over 8% compared to April, and by 16.6% in the first half of June compared to the second half of May. Retail transactions also continued to increase. For example, the Shanghai Grain Company sold a total of over 457,000 *shi* of rice through its stores and retail channels in the second half of March and April, and over 529,000 *shi* in May and the first half of June, an increase of about 15%. This is reflected in the increased amount of bill exchanges. The total amount of exchange in the first half of June reached over 173 billion yuan, an increase of more than 30% compared to the first half of May.

In terms of store turnover, according to a typical survey of 64 stores in 12 industries by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the sales volume of rice, coal, iron, paint, timber, leather, and paper generally increased in May compared to April; the sales volume of yarn, cloth, woolen yarn, flour, and Western medicine decreased slightly. However, in proportion, those with increased sales volume were more common than those with decreased sales volume, and the degree of increase was much greater than the degree of decrease.

At the same time, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has gradually become smoother. The China Department Store Corporation East China Branch ordered and purchased materials from private manufacturers in the first half of June, including cotton textiles worth 17,176,110,000 yuan, and other materials such as foreign goods, groceries, and daily necessities worth 19,225,380,000 yuan were sent to the countryside, exceeding the amount sent to the countryside in the entire month of April, and approaching four times the amount sent to the countryside in the entire month of March. In addition, the quantity of rice procured by private merchants and brought to Shanghai (market registration) was 46,607 *shi* in April, 85,175 *shi* in May, and 80,947 *shi* in the first half of June alone; an increase of 80% over half of May. Another manifestation of the smoother exchange of goods between urban and rural areas is the simultaneous increase in inward and outward remittances. The amount remitted by public-private joint banks and private banks in the second week of June reached 105,377,700,000 yuan, an increase of 71% compared to the fourth week of April; the amount remitted in was 110,002,600,000 yuan, an increase of 78% compared to the fourth week of April.

In addition, the prices of some commodities that had fallen excessively have gradually adjusted. Industrial raw materials, paper, hardware and other commodities whose selling prices were lower than cost when prices fell in March, have recently approached cost or become profitable after a readjustive increase over the past month. For example, the selling price of American caustic soda at the beginning of June had a profit of 7%, and Yuepai caustic soda could earn 3%.

With the increase in transactions, the active exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and the readjustive rise in some prices, the supply and demand situation of commodities in the Shanghai market has also changed. The phenomenon of private merchants competing to sell off goods when prices fell in March has decreased, and the market's demand for goods from state-owned trading companies has also increased significantly. In the first week of June, the average daily sales of materials by state-owned trading companies in the market exceeded the average daily sales in December of last year by 25%, and more than doubled the average daily sales in the first half of April this year. In terms of proportion, sales of yarn accounted for 3.3% of the total market turnover in the first half of April, and then gradually increased, accounting for 46.5% in the first half of June.

In the trend towards a more active market, due to the different supply and demand situations of certain materials, abnormal changes in individual commodity prices have occurred, especially in industrial raw materials and other materials. For example, in the week at the beginning of June, the selling price of coconut oil jumped from a loss of 14% to a profit of 32%, and the profit on June 17 reached 55.8%; the selling price of hydrosulfite jumped from a loss of 9% to a profit of 24%. This kind of deviation in the price adjustment process is detrimental to the normal development of the market and should be brought to the attention of relevant departments.

　　沪滞销局面开始转变
    个别物价变化不正常应加注意
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：五月以来，上海市场已开始转变了三、四月份滞销的情况，逐渐呈现活跃，商品成交量与城乡物资交流量均有增加。这是人民的真实购买力重入市场的反映。
    五月份以来，八种主要商品批发成交量指数较四月份增加百分之十，六月份上半月则较四月份增加百分之二七·六，其中食米、棉布成交量均打破了三月下半月以来的最高纪录。棉纱交易量进入五月份亦有显著增加，计五月份较四月份增加百分之八强，六月上半月较五月下半月增加百分之一六·六。零售交易亦续有增加。如上海粮食公司三月下半月和四月份门市和零售共售出食米四十五万七千余石，五月和六月上半月售出五十二万九千余石，约增加一成半。反映到票据交换方面，则是金额有所增加。六月上半月交换总金额共达一万七千三百余亿元，比五月上半月增加三成以上。
    在商店营业额方面，另据市工商局典型调查的十二个行业、六十四家商店中，米、煤、铁、颜料、木材、皮革及纸张等业销货量，五月份一般均较四月份有增加；纱、布、绒线、面粉及西药业销货量稍见减少。但在比例上，销货量增加者较减少者为普遍，且增加的程度又远较减少的程度为大。
    同时，城乡物资交流已渐转畅。中国百货公司华东区公司向私营厂商订货和收购的物资，六月上半月计有价值一、七一七、六一一万元的棉织品等，另有价值一、九二二、五三八万元的五洋、杂货、日用品等物资下乡，超过四月份全月下乡数量，接近三月份全月下乡数量的四倍。另外，私商采办来沪食米数量（市场登记）四月份计四六、六○七石，五月份八五、一七五石，六月仅上半月即达八○、九四七石；较五月份的半数增加百分之八○。城乡物资交流转畅的又一表现是汇出汇入的同时增加。公私合营银行和私营银行六月第二周汇出金额达一千零五十三亿七千七百万元，较四月第四周增加百分之七一；汇入金额一千一百亿零二千六百万元，较四月第四周增加百分之七八。
    此外，部分下落过多的商品价格已渐调整。三月物价下落时，售价低于成本的工业原料、纸张、五金等商品，经过最近一个月来的调整性的上升，最近已经接近成本或有盈利了。如六月初的美货硫化碱售价已有利润百分之七，月牌烧碱已可赚百分之三。
    随着交易的增加，城乡物资交流的活跃和部分物价调整性的上升，上海市场商品的供求情况亦已改变。三月物价下落时，私商竞相吐售物资的现象已经减少，且市场对国营贸易公司物资的需求又有显著增加。六月第一周，国营贸易公司每天平均在市场出售的物资，超过了去年十二月份平均每天的二成半，比今年四月上半月每天平均增一倍以上。在比重上，四月上半月售纱占市场总成交的百分之三·三，嗣后逐步增加，至六月上半月已占百分之四六·五。
    在市场趋向活跃中，由于某些物资供求情况的不同，却发生了个别物价变化不正常的现象，尤其表现在工业原料等物资上。如六月初的一周间，椰子油售价从亏损百分之一四跃升至可赚百分之三二，六月十七日的利润更达到了百分之五五·八；保险粉售价从亏损百分之九跳升至赚利百分之二四。此种物价调整过程中的偏向，对市场的正常发展是有妨害的，应引起有关各部门的注意。
