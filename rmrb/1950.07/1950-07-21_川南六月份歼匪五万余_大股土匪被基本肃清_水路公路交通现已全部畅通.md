(Xinhua News Agency, Luxian, 16th) The People's Liberation Army Southern Sichuan Military Region troops launched a powerful and comprehensive suppression and encirclement campaign against bandits in the area south of the Yangtze River and west of the Min River in their military region during June. A total of more than 58,000 bandits were annihilated throughout the month. Currently, south of the Yangtze River, in Qingfu, Gongxian, Gusong, and north of Xuyong, except for a few areas where there are still small groups of dozens of bandits, the major bandit forces have been basically eliminated. The Leibo, Mabian, and Muchuan County Detachments of Southern Sichuan also simultaneously opened up the situation in Lei (bo), Ma (bian), Ping (shan), and E (bian), and eliminated the bandits in the area north of the region. In June, waterway and highway transportation throughout the Southern Sichuan region has been fully opened, and long-distance telephone lines in various counties have also been fully repaired and are in operation. After the continuous annihilation of bandit groups, individual remnant bandits are fleeing to the border areas, and our bandit suppression troops in various locations are tracking and suppressing them in the border areas. The complete elimination of bandit groups in the Southern Sichuan region is not far off.

A total of more than 58,000 bandits were annihilated in June. This included the capture of Liu Menglian, commander of the 27th Army of the bandits, Liu Delong, chief of staff, Hu Baduan, commander-in-chief of the "Chinese People's National Salvation Army Southwest Sichuan Guerrilla Column," Xu Huazhang, commander of the 9th Division of the 9th Army of the "Leima Ping E Qian Yi Anti-Communist Headquarters," and 18,030 others, 1,868 bandits wounded, and 38,626 who reformed themselves or surrendered. A large quantity of materials were seized.
