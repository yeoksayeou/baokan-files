Market Situation and Price Analysis in China in Recent Months
Yang Bo
In the past two months, market transactions across the country have gradually returned to normal. The previous phenomena of slow-moving goods, market prices lower than list prices, and an increase in factories and shops applying for closure have begun to change. The overall economic situation in the market has begun to improve. This is mainly reflected in:

(1) Active market transactions and increased transaction volume. For example, in mid-May, the transaction volume of major goods in Tianjin was: flour 110,414 bags, rice 450,000 jin, and cloth 14,280 bolts. In mid-June, compared with mid-May, the transaction volume of flour increased by 17%, rice increased by 407%, and cloth increased by 28.5%. In Shanghai, 3,527 pieces of yarn were traded in mid-May, which increased by 26% in mid-June. In Qingdao, the transaction volume of cloth in mid-May was 8,713 bolts, which increased by 63% in mid-June. In Hankou, 780,000 jin of rice were traded in mid-May, which increased to 6,020,000 jin in mid-June.

(2) The market prices of various major materials in major markets have approached a balance with the list prices. The market prices of some goods are even higher than the list prices of state-owned trading companies. For example, on July 10, the list price and market price of flour in Tianjin were both 66,000 yuan per bag, the list price of rice was 1,300 yuan per jin, and the market price was 1,410 yuan. The list price of wheat was 900 yuan per jin, and the market price was 930 yuan. The list price of 20-count yarn was 5.9 million yuan per piece, the list price of white fine cloth was 240,000 yuan per bolt, and the market price was 243,000 yuan. On July 10, the list price and market price of flour in Shanghai were both 58,000 yuan per bag, the list price of white oil was 4,850 yuan per jin, and the market price was 4,900 yuan. The list price of 20-count yarn was 5.5 million yuan per piece, the list price of coal was 295,000 yuan per ton, and the market price was 300,500 yuan. The list price of vulcanized green was 1.45 million yuan per barrel, and the market price was 1.5 million yuan. In addition, the price differences between wholesale and retail prices, and between producing and selling areas, have been reasonably resolved in recent months after a comprehensive adjustment by state-owned trading companies.

(3) The number of factories and shops closing down has decreased, and the number of openings has increased. The operating enthusiasm of private enterprises has increased, and urban industry and commerce have begun to return to normal. According to statistics from Shanghai from January to June, the number of private industrial and commercial enterprises applying for closure to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in the industrial sector was: 159 in January, 161 in February, 243 in March, 370 in April, 500 in May, and decreased to 108 in the first half of June. At the same time, in the first half of June, no major industries such as cotton spinning, steel, refining, flour, soap, matches, pharmaceuticals, papermaking, leather making, and cement applied for closure. In the commercial sector, the average daily number of applications for closure in the first half of June was 32, which was one-third less than the daily average of 48 in April. According to statistics from Beijing from March to June, the number of industrial and commercial enterprises applying for opening and closing to the Municipal Bureau of Commerce was: 263 openings and 372 closures in March, 236 openings and 738 closures in April, 288 openings and 482 closures in May, and the number of applications for opening increased to 329 in June, an increase of 14% compared to May, and the number of applications for closure decreased to 210, a decrease of 57% compared to May. In addition, the number of enterprises that originally applied for closure but voluntarily withdrew their applications and were willing to continue operating due to the improved market economic situation and increased operating confidence from late May to the end of June was 44, and most of them were large and medium-sized enterprises. For example, a person in charge of a business said: "In March and April, we were already preparing to close down. From May onwards, seeing the government's adjustment of taxes and labor-management issues for businesses, we felt that the government was concerned and taking care of private businesses, so we planned to continue operating." Another person in charge of a business said: "In March and April, we were just thinking of getting through each day as it came, and using up all our resources. Since May, seeing the government's emphasis on industry and commerce, we felt more at ease and are now revitalizing our spirits to continue operating."

Due to active labor-management agreements and operations, on the one hand, actively producing with small profits and quick turnover, and on the other hand, reducing expenses, the production efficiency and operating conditions of many factories and businesses have also improved significantly in recent months. For example, Shanghai Shenxin, Rongfeng and other yarn factories originally planned to strive for an average daily yarn production of 0.8 pounds per spindle two months later, but as a result, the daily yarn production per spindle exceeded 0.8 pounds in the second and third weeks of June. Rongfeng Factory's daily cloth production per loom in June has increased from below 36 yards to 46 yards. The daily turnover of Wing On Company in the department store industry was only 30 to 40 million yuan before May, but increased to 120 to 150 million yuan in late June. The daily turnover of Sincere Company in the past was more than 10 million yuan, but it has now increased to 50 to 60 million yuan per day. The daily turnover of Xinya in the catering industry used to be 3 to 4 million yuan, but it has recently increased to 10 million yuan per day. Another example is Beijing Qianyixiang, whose sales turnover in April was 206.9 million yuan and various expenses were 63.5 million yuan. In May, the sales turnover increased to 240 million yuan, and various expenses decreased to 38.9 million yuan.

While the economic situation in various markets across the country began to improve, the prices of goods in recent months have shown that, on the one hand, the prices of various major necessities of life are still quite stable. Comparing July 10 with May 30, the prices of ten major materials such as grain, cotton, yarn, and cloth in the six major cities of Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and Xi'an have fallen by an average of 2.7%. On the other hand, the prices of various imported industrial raw materials, equipment, some department stores, and gold and silver dollars have risen significantly. For example, comparing June 20 with May 31, vulcanized green in Tianjin rose by 16%, and newsprint rose by 18%. Vulcanized green in Shanghai rose by 47%, and newsprint rose by 34%. Vulcanized green in Qingdao rose by 51%, and newsprint rose by 33%. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the characteristic of rising prices of imported goods has become more obvious. Comparing July 7 with June 24, the percentage increase in each cargo was: Tianjin tinplate 14, baked rubber 17.5, penicillin 23.9. Shanghai files 25, saw blades 32, vulcanized green 20, caustic soda 24, red alum potash 43. In addition, the fluctuations in the black market for gold and US dollars were also greater. Comparing July 10 with June 26, the black market price of gold in Tianjin rose by 17%, Shanghai by 23.6%, Guangzhou by 6%, Hankou by 22%, and Chongqing by 22%. The black market price of US dollars in Tianjin rose by 6%, and Shanghai rose by 8%.

Why have the prices of imported goods risen locally in recent months? The reasons are:

(1) The main reason is that speculative capital is at play. After speculation in major materials such as grain, cotton, yarn, and cloth became impossible, they turned to imported materials. Especially after the outbreak of the Korean War and Truman's reactionary statement, a small number of speculative merchants mistakenly believed that the international situation would undergo major changes, and speculative capital in various markets once stirred, especially impacting imported materials. For example, comparing July 4 with June 24 in Tianjin, five-cent English plates rose by 18.7%. At the same time as the price of imported goods rose, the price of gold also fluctuated greatly due to the fluctuations in the price of gold in Hong Kong. On the contrary, the prices of securities, which had risen more in the previous period, have recently fallen. Comparing July 7 with June 24, Tianjin Qixin shares fell by 30.2%.

(2) Partially due to natural market adjustments. Since the overall stabilization of prices in March, the price of general imported goods has fallen sharply. Many imported goods not only made no profit, but also lost money. According to calculations by the North China Import Company, the average loss ratio of major imported goods in Tianjin from March to May was: Monsanto dinitro (compared with the import cost and the Tianjin market price, the same below) averaged a loss of 32.3% in March, 43.3% in April, and 20.9% in May. No. 3 rubber material averaged a loss of 25.3% in March, 26.8% in April, and 20.8% in May. Other imported goods such as red phosphorus and sacks also lost money in the previous two months. In addition, many imported goods in Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou and other places also lost money in the previous two months. Therefore, in recent months, with the improvement of the overall market economic situation, the price of some imported goods that previously imported at a loss has rebounded to a certain extent, which is appropriate and reasonable. However, the rise in the price of many imported goods now has long exceeded this reasonable limit.

(3) Due to supply and demand. In the case of no profit in imports, or even losses in sales, the business of private importers was generally in a state of stagnation in March and April, and the import volume of many major imported materials has decreased accordingly. In recent months, the government has vigorously adjusted public-private relations, adopted measures to focus on maintaining major private enterprises, implemented processing, ordering, purchasing inventory, and issuing loans, which has made the entire market begin to improve. Many private enterprises are currently trying to purchase raw materials and actively plan to resume production. Therefore, it also shows that the transaction volume of many imported materials such as industrial raw materials and equipment has increased in various markets recently, and some goods have appeared to be in short supply. This is also one of the reasons for the recent rise in the price of imported materials.

The above are the reasons for the rise in the price of imported materials in the previous period. However, it must be pointed out that the rise in the price of imported goods this time is only a local phenomenon in the overall process of stabilizing prices nationwide, and it has not and cannot cause fluctuations in major prices. It is essentially different from the price fluctuations before March.

From the above situation analysis, it is not difficult to understand that the government's policy of stabilizing prices today is definitely unwavering. In the past few months and even in the future, all measures taken by the government in all aspects of finance and economy are based on consolidating the unified leadership of financial and economic work, consolidating the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, and consolidating the stability of currency and prices. The facts of more than four months have proved that in order to ensure the implementation of the above three consolidations, although there are many difficulties, the people's government today is fully capable of overcoming all difficulties and ensuring its realization.

In addition, in order to encourage private businesses to organize the import of various major industrial raw materials and equipment in large quantities, the government has not only relaxed the scale of foreign exchange supply to private businesses, but also slightly lowered the exchange rate of foreign exchange since the beginning of July. In the previous period, the exchange rate of foreign exchange was raised above the black market in order to reward exports. Now, appropriately lowering the exchange rate of foreign exchange to take into account the import profits of importers. Undoubtedly, this measure of the government will play an active role in encouraging future imports by private businesses and stabilizing the prices of imported goods.

In short, the government's policy of stabilizing prices is firm and unwavering. The government has mastered sufficient material strength and is fully capable of ensuring the stability of prices across the country. Under such circumstances, if any speculators dare to take risks, be enemies of the people, and fantasize about destroying the situation of price stability that has been achieved today, they will only wait for the fate of bankruptcy.

　　近月来全国的市场情况与物价分析
    杨波
    近两月来全国各地市场交易已逐渐恢复常态，过去货物滞销，各货市价低于牌价，工厂商店报请歇业增多等现象已开始转变，整个市场的经济情况，已开始好转。这主要表现在：
    （一）市场交易活跃，成交量增大。如五月中旬天津市主要货物的成交量为：面粉一一○、四一四袋，大米四十五万斤，布一四、二八○匹，而六月中旬的成交量，则较五月中旬，面粉增加百分之十七，大米增加百分之四○七，布增加百分之二八·五。上海五月中旬纱成交三五二七件，六月中旬则增加百分之二十六。青岛五月中旬布成交量为八七一三匹，六月中旬增加百分之六十三，汉口五月中旬大米成交七十八万斤，而六月中旬即增至六百零二万斤。
    （二）各主要市场之各种主要物资，市价与牌价已接近平衡，有的货物市价反高于国营贸易公司牌价。如天津七月十日面粉每袋牌市价皆为六六、○○○元，大米每斤牌价一三○○元，市价则为一四一○元，小麦每斤牌价九○○元，市价九三○元，二十支纱每件牌市价均为五九○万元，白细布每匹牌价二十四万元，市价为二十四万三千元。上海七月十日面粉每袋牌市价均为五八·○○○元，白油每斤牌价四八五○元，市价四九○○元，二十支纱每件牌市价均为五五○万元，煤块每吨牌价二十九万五千元，市价为三十万零五千元，硫化青每桶牌价一四五万元，市价为一五○万元。此外各地市场批发价与零售价，产区与销区之间的差价，近月来经国营贸易公司全面调整后，也已得到合理解决。
    （三）工厂商店歇业减少，开业增多，私营企业的经营情绪已提高，城市工商业已开始恢复常态。据上海市一至六月份的统计，私营工商业户向工商局呈请歇业者，在工业方面：一月份一五九件，二月份一六一件，三月份二四三件，四月份三七○件，五月份五○○件，六月上半月则减至一○八件。同时六月上半月棉纺、钢铁、炼制、面粉、肥皂、火柴、制药、造纸、制革、水泥等主要工业，无一家申请歇业。在商业方面，该市六月上半月每日平均申请歇业者三十二件，较四月份每日平均四十八件，亦减少了三分之一。另据北京市三至六月份，工商业户向市商业局申请开业及歇业的户数统计为：三月份开业二六三户，歇业三七二户，四月份开业二三六户，歇业七三八户，五月份开业二八八户，歇业四八二户，至六月份申请开业户数已增至三二九户，较五月份增加了百分之十四，申请歇业户数减至二一○户，较五月份减少了百分之五十七。此外原来申请歇业，近月来由于市场经济情况好转，经营信心提高，而自愿撤消申请歇业书仍愿继续经营者，五月下旬至六月底，亦有四十四户，而且多为大中户，如某商号负责人说：“三四月间我们本已预备歇业，由五月份起见到政府对商号税收的调整，劳资问题的处理，觉得政府对私商是关心的，是照顾的，所以计划仍旧经营下去。”又如某商号负责人说：“在三四月时，只是抱着过一天算一天，耗完为止的心理，五月以来看到政府对工商业的重视，心中才觉到踏实了，现在正振作精神，经营下去。”
    由于劳资协议积极经营，一面积极生产薄利多销，一面节减开支，许多工厂、商号的生产效率与经营情况，近月来亦有显著起色。如上海申新、荣丰等纱厂，原计划两个月后争取每一纱锭平均每日产纱点八磅，但结果在六月份第二、三个星期内每锭日产纱即超过点八磅；荣丰厂六月份每台织机每天的产布量已由三十六码以下，提高至四十六码。百货业中的永安公司，五月份以前每天的营业额只三、四千万元，六月下旬已增至一亿二千万至一亿五千万元，先施公司过去每天的营业额为一千多万元，现已增至每天五、六千万元。酒菜业中的新雅，过去每天营业额三、四百万元，近已增至每天一千万元。再如北京谦益祥，四月份销货流水二○六九○万元，各项开支为六三五○万元，五月份销货流水增至二四○○○万元，各项开支则减至三八九○万元。
    与上述各地市场经济情况开始好转的同时，近月来全国各地的物价，则表现为：一方面各种主要生活必需品的价格，仍是相当稳定的，七月十日与五月三十日比较，津、沪、穗、汉、重庆、西安六大城市，粮食、花、纱、布等十种主要物资的价格，平均下落了百分之二点七。另方面各种进口的工业原料、器材、部分百货及黄金、银元的价格，则上涨较大。如六月二十日与五月三十一日比较，天津硫化青上升百分之十六，白报纸上升百分之十八。上海硫化青上升百分之四十七，白报纸上升百分之三十四。青岛硫化青上升百分之五十一，白报纸上升百分之三十三。而自朝鲜事件爆发后，进口货价格上涨的特点，则更为明显，以七月七日与六月二十四日比较，各货上涨的百分比为：天津马口铁十四，烤胶十七·五，盘尼西林二十三·九。上海锉刀二十五，锯条三十二，硫化青二十，烧碱二十四，红樊钾四十三。此外黄金、美钞黑市的波动亦较大，七月十日与六月二十六日比较，黄金黑市天津涨百分之十七，上海百分之二十三·六，广州百分之六，汉口百分之二十二，重庆百分之二十二。美钞黑市天津涨百分之六，上海涨百分之八。
    为什么近月来进口货价格会发生局部上涨呢？其原因在于：
    （一）主要的是投机资本在作怪。他们在对粮食、花、纱、布等主要物资的投机已经成为不可能之后，就转向进口物资方面。特别是在朝鲜事件爆发，杜鲁门发表反动声明后，一小部分投机商人，即错误地认为国际局势将起重大变化，各地市场的投机资本曾一度蠢动，特别向进口物资冲击。例如，天津市七月四日与六月二十四日比较，五厘英板上涨了百分之一八·七。与进口货价格上涨的同时，黄金价格也受香港金价波动的影响发生很大波动。反之前一时期上升较大的证券价格，近来则有下跌现象。七月七日与六月二十四日比较，津市启新股票下跌了百分之三○·二。
    （二）部分地是由于市场的自然的调整。自三月物价全面稳定后，一般进口货的价格下落幅度较大，很多进口货不但无利可图，而且还亏本。据华北区进口公司计算，天津市三至五月份主要进口货的亏本比例为：孟山都二硝基三月份平均亏本（以进口成本与天津市价比较，下同）百分之三二·三，四月份平均亏本百分之四三·三，五月份平均亏本二○·九。三号胶料三月份平均亏本百分之二五·三，四月份平均亏本百分之二六·八，五月份平均亏本百分之二○·八。其它如赤磷、麻袋等进口货前两月亦皆亏本，此外上海、青岛、广州等地，前两月许多进口货亦皆亏本。因此，近月来随着整个市场经济情况的好转，某些过去进口亏本的进口货的价格在某种程度以内的回涨，是应该的，合理的。但是，现在许多进口货的上涨，早已超过了这种合理的限度。
    （三）是由于供求关系。在进口无利，甚至亏本亦难销售的情况下，三四月间私营进口商的业务，一般皆处于停滞状态，许多主要进口物资的进口量，已因之减少。近月来由于政府大力调整公私关系，对各主要私营企业采取重点维持，实行加工、订货、收购存货及发放贷款等措施，已使整个市场开始好转，许多私营企业目前已在多方设法采购原料，积极筹划恢复生产。因此也即表现了近来各地市场许多工业原料、器材等进口物资的成交量增多，部分货品出现了供不应求的现象。这亦是此次进口物资价格上涨的原因之一。
    以上即是前一时期进口物资价格上涨的原因。但必须指出：此次进口货价格的上涨，从全国物价的全局来看，只是物价全面稳定过程中的局部现象，并没有也不可能引起主要物价的波动。与三月份以前的物价波动，有本质的区别。
    从上述情况分析中，不难了解，今天政府稳定物价的方针，是肯定不移的。近几个月来以至于今后，政府在财政经济各方面的一切措施，皆是以巩固财经工作的统一领导，巩固财政收支平衡，巩固货币与物价的稳定为出发点的。四个多月的事实证明，为保证上述三个巩固的贯彻，虽有许多困难，但今天的人民政府是完全有办法克服一切困难，而保证其实现的。
    此外，为鼓励私商大量组织各种主要工业原料器材的进口，政府目前不但对私商的外汇供应尺度，已予放宽，而且自七月上旬开始，把外汇的牌价稍稍降低，前一时期外汇牌价为着奖励出口，曾提高到黑市以上。现在适当降低外汇牌价，以兼顾进口商的进口利润。无疑政府这一措施，在鼓励今后私商的进口和平抑进口货价格方面，将起积极的作用。
    总之，政府稳定物价的方针是坚定不移的，政府已掌握有充分的物资力量，完全有办法足以保证全国物价的稳定。在这种情况下，如果有投机家还敢于冒险，与人民为敌，异想破坏今天业已取得的物价稳定的局面，他就只有等着破产的命运。
