　　Determined to Defend World Peace
    Letters from Soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

To the Editors:

    We were extremely angry when we saw the statement by the American imperialist Truman regarding armed intervention in Korea's internal affairs and the dispatch of a fleet to invade our territory of Taiwan. It is well known that American imperialism has always been hostile to the people of China and the world. The greatest debt of blood it owes the Chinese people is directing its running dog Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the Chinese people, causing unprecedented devastation to the Chinese people. Truman's statement fully proves that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of all peace-loving, free, and democratic people around the world.

    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism. We will certainly be able to repel the direct armed provocations of American imperialism. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of June 28th and, together with the people of the whole country, pledge to intensify our efforts to liberate Taiwan and all territories belonging to China, and to give the American imperialist aggressors a severe blow. We have sufficient strength and confidence to defend our national territorial sovereignty and lasting world peace.

　　决心保卫世界和平
    中国人民解放军战士来信表示编辑同志：
    我们看到了美帝国主义者杜鲁门关于武装干涉朝鲜内政，并派遣舰队武装侵略我国领土台湾的声明后，心里非常愤怒。尽人皆知，美帝一向是仇视中国和全世界的人民的。他欠中国人民的最大一笔血债，就是指使他的走狗蒋介石屠杀中国人民，使中国人民遭受了空前的浩劫。杜鲁门的声明，完全证明了美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平、自由、民主人民的死敌。
    我们中国人民解放军在毛主席和共产党英明的领导下，战胜了日本帝国主义，战胜了美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石。我们也一定能够打退美帝国主义的直接武装挑衅。我们坚决拥护周外长六月二十八日的声明，和全国人民一道，誓为解放台湾和属于中国的一切领土而加紧努力，给美帝国主义侵略者以严重的打击。我们有足够的力量和信心来保卫祖国的领土主权，和世界的持久和平。
