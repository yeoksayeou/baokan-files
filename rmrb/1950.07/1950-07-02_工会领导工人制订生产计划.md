　　Trade Union Leads Workers in Formulating Production Plans
    [Further News] The trade union of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory was previously disorganized and lacked communication between higher and lower levels. After the leadership of organizations at all levels was reorganized in June, the work of the trade union has made significant progress compared to the past. To prepare for the July competition, the trade union is leading workers in discussing and formulating production plans for groups and individuals. After the production plans were issued on June 29th, the trade union committees, production team leaders, and trade union group leaders of the lathe, foundry, and fitter workshops immediately launched enthusiastic discussions. They committed to including achievable targets in the plan. Some individual group leaders initially wanted to set lower targets, but this was corrected after everyone pointed it out seriously. During the discussion, considerable estimations were made regarding difficult problems, and methods to overcome them were studied. The problem of screw manufacturing was resolved by administrative comrades after research by the trade union and workers. The lathe workshop didn’t have many tasks, and many workers were transferred to the fitter workshop, where they were unfamiliar with the work and faced many difficulties. However, after the plan was issued, everyone unanimously guaranteed that they would overcome the difficulties and complete the task. The work of the inspection section will be further expanded from inspecting finished products to inspecting models. Daily production charts are also being prepared in the foundry workshop, where defective products are easily produced. The defective product exhibition organized by the trade union at the end of the Red May production campaign will continue to be implemented during the July competition, which will greatly contribute to improving quality and reducing costs.

　　工会领导工人制订生产计划
    【又讯】华北农业机械总厂工会组织过去上下不通气，六月份改选了各级组织的领导机构后，工会工作较前已大有进展。为了作好七月竞赛的准备工作，领导工人讨论制订小组、个人的生产计划。六月二十九日生产计划发下后，车、铸、钳三个车间的工会委员会，生产、工会小组长，当天即热烈展开讨论。能作多少就在计划上订多少，个别小组长想少订一些，经大家认真指出后，已经改正。讨论中并对困难问题作了相当估计，并研讨了克服的办法。螺丝的制造问题，就是在工会和工人研究后，经行政同志解决的。车工间因为任务不多，很多工友拨到钳工间，生手生地，困难很多，可是在计划下来后，都一致保证一定克服困难完成任务。检验科的工作也将从检验成品进一步做到检验模型，还准备在容易出废品的铸工间作每日生产图表，工会在红五月生产末期组织的废品展览，准备七月竞赛中继续实行，这将对提高质量、减低成本起很大作用。
