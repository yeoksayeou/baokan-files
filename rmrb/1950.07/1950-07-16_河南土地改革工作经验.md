Henan Land Reform Work Experience
	Chen Xiaoyu

Before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the State Council of the Central People's Government, Henan Province completed the distribution of land in 43 counties with a population of more than 16 million last winter and this spring. This land reform in Henan was carried out in a planned, organized, and mass-scale manner, and generally proceeded smoothly.

The three main experiences of Henan's land reform work are: before entering land reform, there should be mature and sufficient preparation work. In the work, we should focus on three important links: reorganizing the peasant ranks, classifying classes, and confiscating, requisitioning, and distributing land. People's representatives' conferences and peasant representatives' conferences are the main organizational forms and working methods for launching, leading, and promoting the movement, especially the peasant representatives' conferences, which should run through every link of the entire process of work; rural production must not be relaxed at any time due to land reform.

	Entering Land Reform, There Must Be Mature and Sufficient Preparation

Henan's experience proves that before implementing land reform, a large-scale rent reduction movement must be carried out. Through the rent reduction movement, the awareness of peasants can be further improved, and the peasant ranks can be further organized and trained. The usual rule is: after the movement to eliminate bandits and oppose bullies, most peasants can only see the crimes of individual bullies, such as murdering and seizing property, and forcibly occupying women from good families. But the principle that the entire landlord class economically exploits the peasants and that the peasant class is forced to support the landlord class is vague. Only after rent reduction can they more clearly understand that it is not the landlords who support the peasants, but the peasants who support the landlords. Areas where rent reduction has been carried out seriously can smoothly carry out the work of land distribution; otherwise, there will be many difficulties and problems such as rough work and half-baked meals are likely to occur.

Secondly, before implementing land reform, cadres must be trained on a large scale and repeatedly. The province convenes meetings of main cadres from the special commissioner's offices and counties, the special commissioner's offices convene meetings of main cadres from counties and districts, and the counties convene meetings of district and township cadres, so that the government's policies, guidelines, and methods are passed down level by level, so that each cadre consciously accepts them. Xinyang Special District and Xuchang Special District's Xuchang, Wuyang, Yancheng, Changge, Yanling, and LinÈ¢ç counties in Henan Province trained more than 12,000 land reform work cadres. About one-fifth to one-quarter of them were new intellectual cadres, and the others were veteran cadres with considerable rural work experience and peasant cadres who grew up in the anti-bullying and rent reduction movement. Because some leftist deviations such as indiscriminate beatings and killings and infringement of the interests of middle peasants had occurred in the peasant movement against bandits and bullies and rent reduction in Henan Province, the province focused on eliminating the remnants of leftist ideology in the minds of cadres when training cadres, and also prevented possible rightist deviations. Among the new intellectual cadres, it was emphasized that they should establish a revolutionary outlook on life and a mass viewpoint.

When studying land reform policies, general work cadres, especially peasant cadres, find it easier to accept the principles of not beating or killing indiscriminately, not infringing on the middle peasants, and not confiscating landlords' industrial and commercial properties. However, they found it difficult to understand the stipulation of "not digging up buried treasures and not distributing floating assets." Some of them said: "The landlords in Henan are too cheap." The method of getting through this idea is mainly to calculate the "gains and losses." That is, let them specifically calculate: how much did the peasants get and how much did they lose when the floating assets were distributed; how much did they lose and how much did they gain when the floating assets were not distributed? At that time, the example of a township in Xiping County was cited to calculate: the first time the floating assets of a landlord's family were confiscated, the result was that other landlords secretly cut down pear trees, buried clothes, and burned furniture. And some farmers got a torn piece of clothing, and some got a stool, with little gain. The second time, the landlords' floating assets were not touched, which not only reduced destruction and minimized damage to social wealth, but also greatly reduced the resistance of the movement. From such many specific examples, the cadres gradually realized that: in order to reduce destruction, avoid causing chaos, and reduce resistance, the policy of "not confiscating landlords' floating assets" is necessary. They said: "We can't burn the cotton jacket to catch lice." In addition, enabling cadres to learn how to classify classes and oppose the style of corruption, commandism, and coercion is also an important part of training. On the issue of style, after repeated discussions, on the basis of cadres' ideological consciousness, they all set these few disciplines: not to be landlords' air-raid shelters, not to violate policies, not to embezzle fruits, and not to command or coerce.

Third, select typical villages to conduct land reform experiments to gain experience. In the typical experiments in various parts of Henan, in addition to gaining the necessary experience in terms of working methods and steps, several counties also specifically resolved two incorrect ideas of cadres. Some people believe that land reform is very simple and can be done easily. Their basis is: "Since the big bullies have been overthrown, what are we afraid of ordinary landlords?" They do not understand that land reform is a serious class struggle. The fact is: in this land reform, although the resistance of the landlords is generally smaller than in the past, it is still quite stubborn. Their general performance is "step-by-step and resistance at every step." There is a relatively common rule: at the beginning, they do not admit that they are landlords, and if they admit that they are landlords, they do not admit that there is exploitation, and if they admit that there is exploitation, they do not admit that the exploitation is unreasonable. After being educated by these specific facts, most of the cadres broke the wrong idea of "easy to do" and realized that land reform is a serious class struggle.

Another wrong idea, which is another extreme of the above-mentioned wrong idea, is that land reform is extremely complex and difficult and difficult to complete. But the facts show that as long as you can do it patiently, it can be completed. All the old liberated areas have completed land reform, which fully proves this. In this way, the wrong idea of some staff members fearing land reform work was also broken.

	In the Process of Land Distribution, Three Main Links Must Be Mastered

In the process of land distribution, three main links must be mastered.

The first is to reorganize the peasant ranks, mainly to rectify the organization of peasant associations. The process of launching the land reform movement in Henan shows that the peasant ranks should generally be reorganized after the policies are publicized and the peasants have been initially mobilized. The purpose of the reorganization is to consolidate and expand the peasant association on its original basis, purify the leading components and have preliminary class consciousness, so as to strengthen the strength of the peasants and unify the actions of the peasant class.

In rectifying the peasant association, on the one hand, the tendency of closed-doorism must be broken, and on the principle of relying on poor peasants and farm laborers, middle peasants should be boldly absorbed and peasant women should be actively absorbed. On the other hand, class alien elements should be carefully cleaned up. Problems such as embezzlement of fruits and sectarianism within the peasants should be corrected by means of criticism and self-criticism, so as to achieve the consolidation and unity of the peasant association. At the same time, it is best to conduct a democratic re-election of the power organization - the township committee (cadres can be re-elected for successive terms). This is a democratic education for the masses, and it is also a serious test for the cadres. The main purpose of doing this is to enable the township power organization to be selfless when assisting the peasant association in distributing land and to accept the supervision of the masses.

The second link is to classify class components. In the land reform in Henan, the classification of classes is roughly divided into four steps, namely, explanation, classification, evaluation, and approval. It is advocated to handle affairs in accordance with policies, and refute the incorrect saying popular among some peasants that "one mu is poor, two mu is middle, three mu and four mu are comfortable households (referring to rich peasants), and five mu and six mu are landlords." When classifying classes, landlords are allowed to appeal and debate, and after evaluating classes, it must be approved by the district government, and they are allowed to appeal.

The third link is to confiscate, requisition, and distribute land in accordance with laws and regulations. Before confiscating and requisitioning, a township peasant representative meeting must be convened to make preparations and solve three problems: (1) Make the peasants understand the policy of confiscation and requisition, that is: what to want and what not to want. In this land reform, the slogan of "five wants and five don'ts" is almost known to every household in the vast rural areas of Henan. The "five wants" are: land, farm tools, draft animals, houses in rural areas, and surplus grain. The "five don'ts" are: don't touch industry and commerce, don't dig up buried treasures, don't distribute floating assets, don't beat or kill indiscriminately, and don't infringe on the interests of middle peasants. (2) Elect the confiscation and requisition committee. (3) Prevent landlords from resisting and destroying means of production. When confiscating and requisitioning, Henan generally can treat each household of landlords differently according to their different situations. For general landlords, the methods of consultation, negotiation, and self-reporting public discussion are used to solve the problem; for a small number of landlords who resolutely resist and secretly destroy materials, the people's court is used to punish them according to law; enlightened landlords are given appropriate preferential treatment and care.

	People's Representatives' Conferences and Peasant Representatives' Conferences Should Run Through Every Working Link

People's representatives' conferences and peasant representatives' conferences run through every working link. Production work must not be relaxed at any time. In Henan's land reform, each county's representatives (including representatives of people's representatives' conferences at all levels and peasant representatives' conferences at all levels) were more than 10,000 people, and Xuchang County had as many as 16,400 people. During the three months of land reform in various parts of Henan, county, district, and township levels held a total of 886 representative meetings of various kinds. In an ordinary village with 200 households, there are roughly 50 or 60 representatives of various classes of peasants. These representatives have indeed played a huge role in publicizing policies and mobilizing and organizing the masses. When the preparatory work for land distribution is completed, county, district, and township-level peasant representative conferences are held continuously. These thousands of representatives become a very good propaganda army, and they bring the government's policies to various villages and various classes. After the representative meeting, various meetings such as poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, women, youth, and landlords are held in each township to talk about class classification and policies. In this way, each class knows what is in their hearts and can handle affairs in accordance with policies, and land reform work can be carried out in good order. During this land reform period in Henan Province, many peasants and landlords copied announcements and bought notebooks (documents for class classification), and books on class classification and other books related to land reform in bookstores were sold out of stock. In this way, the policies were widely met by the masses, which greatly helped the work.

	In the Land Reform Work, Leadership in Production Cannot Be Relaxed

The purpose of land reform is to liberate rural productive forces, to increase agricultural production, and to open up the road for China's industrialization. And most of the peasants, especially the poor peasants and farm laborers, will go hungry if they do not produce for a day. Therefore, if land reform is not closely combined with production, it will affect the timely completion of land reform and violate the basic spirit of land reform. Wuyang County's Ninth District paid attention to disaster relief in this land reform, turning the original disaster-stricken area into a lightly affected area. The farmers in the district said with satisfaction: "If we have food to eat, we have the energy to fight the landlords. Please buy a few knives of hemp paper and record our grievances." Due to neglecting production, the Tenth District of the county turned a mild disaster into a serious disaster. The farmers said frustratedly: "How can you ask me to carry out land reform on an empty stomach?" Henan's experience is that if we do not pay attention to leading peasants in production at the same time in land reform work, we will inevitably be divorced from the masses.
