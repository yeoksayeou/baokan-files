Henan Land Reform Work Experience
	Chen Xiaoyu

Before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the State Council of the Central People's Government, Henan Province completed the distribution of land in 43 counties with a population of more than 16 million last winter and this spring. This land reform in Henan was carried out in a planned, organized, and mass-scale manner, and generally proceeded smoothly.

The three main experiences of Henan's land reform work are: before entering land reform, there should be mature and sufficient preparation work. In the work, we should focus on three important links: reorganizing the peasant ranks, classifying classes, and confiscating, requisitioning, and distributing land. People's representatives' conferences and peasant representatives' conferences are the main organizational forms and working methods for launching, leading, and promoting the movement, especially the peasant representatives' conferences, which should run through every link of the entire process of work; rural production must not be relaxed at any time due to land reform.

	Entering Land Reform, There Must Be Mature and Sufficient Preparation

Henan's experience proves that before implementing land reform, a large-scale rent reduction movement must be carried out. Through the rent reduction movement, the awareness of peasants can be further improved, and the peasant ranks can be further organized and trained. The usual rule is: after the movement to eliminate bandits and oppose bullies, most peasants can only see the crimes of individual bullies, such as murdering and seizing property, and forcibly occupying women from good families. But the principle that the entire landlord class economically exploits the peasants and that the peasant class is forced to support the landlord class is vague. Only after rent reduction can they more clearly understand that it is not the landlords who support the peasants, but the peasants who support the landlords. Areas where rent reduction has been carried out seriously can smoothly carry out the work of land distribution; otherwise, there will be many difficulties and problems such as rough work and half-baked meals are likely to occur.

Secondly, before implementing land reform, cadres must be trained on a large scale and repeatedly. The province convenes meetings of main cadres from the special commissioner's offices and counties, the special commissioner's offices convene meetings of main cadres from counties and districts, and the counties convene meetings of district and township cadres, so that the government's policies, guidelines, and methods are passed down level by level, so that each cadre consciously accepts them. Xinyang Special District and Xuchang Special District's Xuchang, Wuyang, Yancheng, Changge, Yanling, and Lin颍 counties in Henan Province trained more than 12,000 land reform work cadres. About one-fifth to one-quarter of them were new intellectual cadres, and the others were veteran cadres with considerable rural work experience and peasant cadres who grew up in the anti-bullying and rent reduction movement. Because some leftist deviations such as indiscriminate beatings and killings and infringement of the interests of middle peasants had occurred in the peasant movement against bandits and bullies and rent reduction in Henan Province, the province focused on eliminating the remnants of leftist ideology in the minds of cadres when training cadres, and also prevented possible rightist deviations. Among the new intellectual cadres, it was emphasized that they should establish a revolutionary outlook on life and a mass viewpoint.

When studying land reform policies, general work cadres, especially peasant cadres, find it easier to accept the principles of not beating or killing indiscriminately, not infringing on the middle peasants, and not confiscating landlords' industrial and commercial properties. However, they found it difficult to understand the stipulation of "not digging up buried treasures and not distributing floating assets." Some of them said: "The landlords in Henan are too cheap." The method of getting through this idea is mainly to calculate the "gains and losses." That is, let them specifically calculate: how much did the peasants get and how much did they lose when the floating assets were distributed; how much did they lose and how much did they gain when the floating assets were not distributed? At that time, the example of a township in Xiping County was cited to calculate: the first time the floating assets of a landlord's family were confiscated, the result was that other landlords secretly cut down pear trees, buried clothes, and burned furniture. And some farmers got a torn piece of clothing, and some got a stool, with little gain. The second time, the landlords' floating assets were not touched, which not only reduced destruction and minimized damage to social wealth, but also greatly reduced the resistance of the movement. From such many specific examples, the cadres gradually realized that: in order to reduce destruction, avoid causing chaos, and reduce resistance, the policy of "not confiscating landlords' floating assets" is necessary. They said: "We can't burn the cotton jacket to catch lice." In addition, enabling cadres to learn how to classify classes and oppose the style of corruption, commandism, and coercion is also an important part of training. On the issue of style, after repeated discussions, on the basis of cadres' ideological consciousness, they all set these few disciplines: not to be landlords' air-raid shelters, not to violate policies, not to embezzle fruits, and not to command or coerce.

Third, select typical villages to conduct land reform experiments to gain experience. In the typical experiments in various parts of Henan, in addition to gaining the necessary experience in terms of working methods and steps, several counties also specifically resolved two incorrect ideas of cadres. Some people believe that land reform is very simple and can be done easily. Their basis is: "Since the big bullies have been overthrown, what are we afraid of ordinary landlords?" They do not understand that land reform is a serious class struggle. The fact is: in this land reform, although the resistance of the landlords is generally smaller than in the past, it is still quite stubborn. Their general performance is "step-by-step and resistance at every step." There is a relatively common rule: at the beginning, they do not admit that they are landlords, and if they admit that they are landlords, they do not admit that there is exploitation, and if they admit that there is exploitation, they do not admit that the exploitation is unreasonable. After being educated by these specific facts, most of the cadres broke the wrong idea of "easy to do" and realized that land reform is a serious class struggle.

Another wrong idea, which is another extreme of the above-mentioned wrong idea, is that land reform is extremely complex and difficult and difficult to complete. But the facts show that as long as you can do it patiently, it can be completed. All the old liberated areas have completed land reform, which fully proves this. In this way, the wrong idea of some staff members fearing land reform work was also broken.

	In the Process of Land Distribution, Three Main Links Must Be Mastered

In the process of land distribution, three main links must be mastered.

The first is to reorganize the peasant ranks, mainly to rectify the organization of peasant associations. The process of launching the land reform movement in Henan shows that the peasant ranks should generally be reorganized after the policies are publicized and the peasants have been initially mobilized. The purpose of the reorganization is to consolidate and expand the peasant association on its original basis, purify the leading components and have preliminary class consciousness, so as to strengthen the strength of the peasants and unify the actions of the peasant class.

In rectifying the peasant association, on the one hand, the tendency of closed-doorism must be broken, and on the principle of relying on poor peasants and farm laborers, middle peasants should be boldly absorbed and peasant women should be actively absorbed. On the other hand, class alien elements should be carefully cleaned up. Problems such as embezzlement of fruits and sectarianism within the peasants should be corrected by means of criticism and self-criticism, so as to achieve the consolidation and unity of the peasant association. At the same time, it is best to conduct a democratic re-election of the power organization - the township committee (cadres can be re-elected for successive terms). This is a democratic education for the masses, and it is also a serious test for the cadres. The main purpose of doing this is to enable the township power organization to be selfless when assisting the peasant association in distributing land and to accept the supervision of the masses.

The second link is to classify class components. In the land reform in Henan, the classification of classes is roughly divided into four steps, namely, explanation, classification, evaluation, and approval. It is advocated to handle affairs in accordance with policies, and refute the incorrect saying popular among some peasants that "one mu is poor, two mu is middle, three mu and four mu are comfortable households (referring to rich peasants), and five mu and six mu are landlords." When classifying classes, landlords are allowed to appeal and debate, and after evaluating classes, it must be approved by the district government, and they are allowed to appeal.

The third link is to confiscate, requisition, and distribute land in accordance with laws and regulations. Before confiscating and requisitioning, a township peasant representative meeting must be convened to make preparations and solve three problems: (1) Make the peasants understand the policy of confiscation and requisition, that is: what to want and what not to want. In this land reform, the slogan of "five wants and five don'ts" is almost known to every household in the vast rural areas of Henan. The "five wants" are: land, farm tools, draft animals, houses in rural areas, and surplus grain. The "five don'ts" are: don't touch industry and commerce, don't dig up buried treasures, don't distribute floating assets, don't beat or kill indiscriminately, and don't infringe on the interests of middle peasants. (2) Elect the confiscation and requisition committee. (3) Prevent landlords from resisting and destroying means of production. When confiscating and requisitioning, Henan generally can treat each household of landlords differently according to their different situations. For general landlords, the methods of consultation, negotiation, and self-reporting public discussion are used to solve the problem; for a small number of landlords who resolutely resist and secretly destroy materials, the people's court is used to punish them according to law; enlightened landlords are given appropriate preferential treatment and care.

	People's Representatives' Conferences and Peasant Representatives' Conferences Should Run Through Every Working Link

People's representatives' conferences and peasant representatives' conferences run through every working link. Production work must not be relaxed at any time. In Henan's land reform, each county's representatives (including representatives of people's representatives' conferences at all levels and peasant representatives' conferences at all levels) were more than 10,000 people, and Xuchang County had as many as 16,400 people. During the three months of land reform in various parts of Henan, county, district, and township levels held a total of 886 representative meetings of various kinds. In an ordinary village with 200 households, there are roughly 50 or 60 representatives of various classes of peasants. These representatives have indeed played a huge role in publicizing policies and mobilizing and organizing the masses. When the preparatory work for land distribution is completed, county, district, and township-level peasant representative conferences are held continuously. These thousands of representatives become a very good propaganda army, and they bring the government's policies to various villages and various classes. After the representative meeting, various meetings such as poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, women, youth, and landlords are held in each township to talk about class classification and policies. In this way, each class knows what is in their hearts and can handle affairs in accordance with policies, and land reform work can be carried out in good order. During this land reform period in Henan Province, many peasants and landlords copied announcements and bought notebooks (documents for class classification), and books on class classification and other books related to land reform in bookstores were sold out of stock. In this way, the policies were widely met by the masses, which greatly helped the work.

	In the Land Reform Work, Leadership in Production Cannot Be Relaxed

The purpose of land reform is to liberate rural productive forces, to increase agricultural production, and to open up the road for China's industrialization. And most of the peasants, especially the poor peasants and farm laborers, will go hungry if they do not produce for a day. Therefore, if land reform is not closely combined with production, it will affect the timely completion of land reform and violate the basic spirit of land reform. Wuyang County's Ninth District paid attention to disaster relief in this land reform, turning the original disaster-stricken area into a lightly affected area. The farmers in the district said with satisfaction: "If we have food to eat, we have the energy to fight the landlords. Please buy a few knives of hemp paper and record our grievances." Due to neglecting production, the Tenth District of the county turned a mild disaster into a serious disaster. The farmers said frustratedly: "How can you ask me to carry out land reform on an empty stomach?" Henan's experience is that if we do not pay attention to leading peasants in production at the same time in land reform work, we will inevitably be divorced from the masses.

　　河南土地改革工作经验
    陈笑雨
    在中央人民政府土地改革法颁布以前，经过中央人民政府政务院的批准，河南省已于去冬今春在四十三县一千六百余万人口的地区内，完成了分配土地的工作。河南这次土地改革工作是在有领导、有组织而又有群众规模的情况下进行的，一般地说，进行得比较顺利。
    河南省土地改革工作中的三个主要的经验是：进入土地改革以前，应有成熟的充分的准备工作。工作中应抓紧：整编农民队伍、划分阶级和没收征收分配土地三个重要的环节。各界代表会议和农民代表会议是开展运动、领导运动和推动运动的主要组织形式和工作方法，特别是农民代表会议，应贯穿于工作全部过程中的各个关节；农村生产任何时候也不能因土地改革而放松。
            进入土地改革以前  要有成熟的充分的准备
    河南的经验证明，在实行土地改革以前，必须进行一次大规模的减租运动。经过减租运动，可以进一步提高农民的觉悟，可以进一步组织和训练农民队伍。通常的规律是：经过肃清土匪和反对恶霸的运动，农民大半仅能看到个别恶霸谋财害命，强占良家妇女一类的罪恶。而对整个地主阶级在经济上剥削农民，农民阶级被强迫去养活地主阶级的道理是模糊不清的。经过减租，他们才能较清楚地了解：不是地主养活农民，而是农民养活地主。凡是认真进行过减租的地区，分配土地的工作就能顺利开展；反之，则困难重重，容易发生工作粗糙，夹生饭等等毛病。
    其次，在实行土地改革前要大规模地、反复地训练干部。省召集专署、县的主要干部开会，专署召集县、区的主要干部开会，县又召集区乡干部开会，使政府的方针、政策、办法逐级下达，为每个干部自觉地接受。河南省信阳专区和许昌专区的许昌、舞阳、郾城、长葛、鄢陵、临颍等六个县，训练了土地改革工作干部一万二千余人。其中大约五分之一到四分之一是新的知识分子干部，其他为有相当农村工作经验的老干部和在反霸减租中长成的农民干部。由于河南省在反匪反霸、减租的农民运动中曾发生过一些乱打乱杀、侵犯中农利益等左倾偏向，该省在训练干部时就着重地注意了肃清干部思想上的左的残余，同时也防止了可能发生的右的偏向。在新的知识分子干部中，则强调他们应建立革命人生观和群众观点。
    在学习土改政策时，一般工作干部、特别是农民干部对不乱打乱杀、不侵犯中农、不没收地主工商业等，接受较为容易。但对于“不挖地财和不分浮财”的规定，他们就不易想通。他们有的说：“河南的地主太便宜了”。打通这个思想的方法主要是算“得失账”。即让他们具体算一算：分了浮财农民得了多少，失了多少；不分浮财又失了多少，得了多少？当时举出西平县一个乡的例子算了一算：第一次没收了一家地主的浮财，结果其他地主偷着把梨树砍掉，衣服埋掉，家具也烧毁了。而农民有的分了一件破衣服，有的分了一条板凳，所得无几。第二次没有动地主的浮财，不仅减少了破坏，使社会财富很少受损害，而且大大减少了运动的阻力。干部们从这样的许多具体事例当中，逐渐认识了：为了减少破坏，避免引起混乱，减少阻力，“不没收地主浮财”的政策是必需的。他们说：“不能因为捉虱子烧了棉袄”。此外，使干部学会划阶级，和反对贪污腐化、强迫命令的作风，也是训练的重要内容。在作风问题上，一般经过反复讨论后，在干部思想自觉的基础上，都订了这末几条纪律：不当地主的防空洞，不违犯政策，不贪污果实，不强迫命令等。
    第三，选择典型的乡村进行土地改革的试验，以取得经验。河南各地在典型试验中，除了在工作的方法和步骤方面取得了必要的经验外，若干县份还具体解决了干部的两个不正确的思想。有的认为土地改革工作很简单，可以轻而易举。他们的根据是：“既然大恶霸都打倒了，还怕普通地主？”他们不懂得土地改革是一场严重的阶级斗争。事实是：地主在这次土地改革中，抵抗一般比过去虽然是小了些，但还是相当顽强的。他们一般的表现是“步步为营，节节抵抗”。有一个比较普遍的规律：他们开头是不承认自己是地主，承认了是地主又不承认有剥削，承认了有剥削又不承认剥削不合理。干部们经过这些具体事实的教育后，多数打破了“轻而易举”的错误想法，认识到土地改革是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    另一个错误思想，也就是上述错误思想的另一极端，即认为土地改革工作极端复杂艰巨，难以完成。但事实说明：只要能够耐心地做下去，是能够完成的。一切老解放区都已经完成土地改革充分证明这一点。这样，某些工作人员害怕土地改革工作的错误的想法也被打破了。
            在土地分配进程中  要掌握好三个主要环节
    在土地分配的进程中要掌握好三个主要环节。
    第一个是整编农民队伍，主要是整顿农民协会的组织。河南省发动土地改革运动的过程说明：一般应在进行宣传政策和农民有初步发动之后，就整编农民队伍。整编目的是把农民协会在原有基础上巩固和扩大，使领导成份纯洁并有初步的阶级觉悟，以壮大农民的力量并统一农民阶级的行动。
    整顿农民协会中，一方面要打破关门主义的偏向，在依靠贫农、雇农的原则下，大胆地吸收中农与积极地吸收农民妇女参加。另一方面对阶级异己分子，要慎重地加以清洗。对农民内部的贪污果实、闹宗派等问题，则运用批评与自我批评的方法来纠正，用以达到农民协会的巩固和团结。与此同时，最好把政权组织——乡委员会进行一次民主改选（干部连选得连任）。这对群众是一次民主教育，对干部也是一次严重考验。这样做的主要目的是使乡村政权组织在协助农会进行分配土地时能大公无私，接受群众的监督。
    第二个环节是划定阶级成份。河南在土地改革中划分阶级大约分为四个步骤，即讲解、划分、评定和批准。在工作中提倡按政策办事，批驳在一些农民中流行的“一亩贫、二亩中、三亩四亩舒坦户（指富农），五亩六亩是地主”的不正确说法。划阶级时允许地主申诉、辩论，评定阶级后还须经过区政府批准，并允许本人上告。
    第三个环节是按法令没收、征收和分配土地。没收、征收前，须召开乡农民代表会议，进行准备，解决三个问题：（一）使农民懂得没收和征收的政策，即：要什么，不要什么。这次土地改革中，“五要五不要”的口号，在河南广大农村中差不多家喻户晓。“五要”为：要土地、农具、耕畜、农村中的房屋和多余的粮食。“五不要”为：不动工商业、不挖底财、不分浮财、不乱打乱杀和不侵犯中农利益。（二）选举没收、征收委员会。（三）防止地主抵抗和对生产资料的破坏。没收、征收时，河南各地一般都能按各户地主不同情况分别对待，对一般地主用协商、谈判、自报公议等方式解决；对少数坚决抗拒、暗中破坏资材的地主，就运用人民法庭依法惩处；对开明的地主就适当地优待和照顾。
            各界代表会农民代表会  应贯穿于各个工作环节
    各界代表会、农民代表会贯穿于各个工作环节。生产工作任何时候也不能放松。河南土地改革中，每个县的代表（包括各界代表会议的代表和各级农民代表会的代表）都在万人以上，许昌县多至一万六千四百人。河南各地进行土地改革的三个月间，县、区、乡三级共召开了各种代表会八百八十六次。普通一个二百户人家的村庄，农民各阶层代表大体有五六十人。这些代表确实起了宣传政策、发动和组织群众的巨大作用。当分配土地的准备工作完成后，即连续召开县、区、乡各级农代会。这些成千上万的代表们就成为一支很好的宣传大军，他们把政府的政策带到了各个乡村、各个阶层。代表会后，各乡就分别召开贫农、雇农、中农、妇女、青年、地主等各种会议，来讲划分阶级和讲政策。这样，各阶层各自心中有数，都能按政策办事，土地改革工作就能在良好的秩序下进行。在河南省这次土地改革时期中，农民、地主抄布告、买本本（划阶级的文件）的很多，书店里划阶级等有关土地改革的书籍都销售一空，供不应求。这样，就使政策广泛和群众见了面，大大地有助于工作的进行。
            在土地改革工作中  不能放松领导生产
    土地改革的目的是为了解放农村的生产力，为了提高农业生产，为中国的工业化开辟道路。而农民们特别是贫农和雇农，大半是一天不生产就要饿一天肚皮的。因此，土地改革不紧紧结合生产，就会影响土地改革的及时完成，并且违反土地改革的基本精神。舞阳县第九区这次土地改革工作中重视了救灾，使原来的重灾区变成了轻灾区。该区农民满意地说：“有饭吃，斗地主有劲。请买几刀麻纸，把我们的诉苦记下来。”该县第十区由于轻视生产，使轻灾发展成了重灾。农民懊丧地说：“饿着肚子叫我怎么土地改革？”河南的经验是，在土地改革工作中不注意同时领导农民生产，就必然脱离群众。
