Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 22nd: People from all walks of life in Korea warmly endorse Marshal Stalin's reply to Nehru regarding the proposal for resolving the Korean issue. Jeong Seong-yeon, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Party, stated: Marshal Stalin's reply is in complete accordance with the will of the Korean and global people. The decision on the Korean issue forcibly passed by the American imperialists using a voting machine submissive to the dollar, without the participation of representatives from the Soviet Union, New China, and the Korean people, is illegal, violates the wishes of people all over the world, and is therefore impossible to implement. Park Won-gil, Central Committee Member of the Chondoist Chongu Party, said: The Korean people must wage a comprehensive struggle until the American imperialists cease their armed intervention, and will never yield to any threats or intimidation. However, the peace-loving Korean people are also unwilling to see the war continue for a long time. Therefore, they actively support the exchange of views between Marshal Stalin and Nehru. Leaders of the Laboring People's Party, the Mine Workers' Trade Union, and the Women's Alliance have also issued statements endorsing Stalin's reply.

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to a TASS report: Newspapers in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, all published the full text of Marshal Stalin's reply to Nehru on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on their front pages on the 20th. Radio stations have also broadcast this document, which fully accords with the freedom-loving will of all mankind and the fundamental interests of the Korean people, multiple times.

On the same day, newspapers in Tirana, the capital of the People's Republic of Albania, also published Marshal Stalin's reply in prominent positions.
