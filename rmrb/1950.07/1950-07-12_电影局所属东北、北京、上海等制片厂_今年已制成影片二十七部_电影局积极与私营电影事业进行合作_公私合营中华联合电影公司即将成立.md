　　Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The Northeast, Beijing, and Shanghai film studios under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, following this year's production plan (26 feature films, 17 documentaries, 1 animation film, and 40 Soviet translated films), have already produced 8 feature films, 12 documentaries, and 7 Soviet translated films, with the remainder currently in production. Among the feature films already produced and currently in production, 8 reflect the Liberation War, 5 reflect industrial production and worker struggles, 5 reflect agricultural production, peasant support for the front lines and joining the army, and rural anti-feudal struggles, 4 reflect the War of Resistance Against Japan and historical stories such as the Land Revolution, and 4 are about ethnic minorities and student movements.
　　In addition to planning to produce popular short story films and science education films that meet the needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and mainly promote current affairs policies and scientific knowledge, the bureau has also, in order to better cooperate with private film enterprises, consulted with Kunlun and Changjiang film companies and agreed to establish a joint public-private "China United Film Company" based on these two companies in Shanghai, and decided to start with contract production (that is, the public side will first sign a general production contract with Kunlun and Changjiang companies respectively, and a separate contract will be signed before the start of each film), and gradually move towards complete public-private joint ventures. The United Film Company will be formally established in Shanghai soon, and has already drafted this year's film production plan which includes 8 feature films such as "Condemned by Thousands," "True Love," "Between Us Husband and Wife," "Second Front," "The Biography of Mu Hanxiang," "The Beginning of Life," and "New Direction," among which "Condemned by Thousands" began filming in June, and "True Love" and "Second Front" will begin filming within days.

    今年已制成影片二十七部
    电影局积极与私营电影事业进行合作  公私合营中华联合电影公司即将成立
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府文化部电影局所属东北、北京、上海三个制片厂，按照今年生产计划（故事片二十六部，记录片十七部，美术片一部，苏联翻译片四十部）现已制成故事片八部、记录片十二部，苏联翻译片七部，其余正在摄制中。在已制成的及正摄制中的故事片中，其主题反映解放战争的八部，工业生产与工人斗争的五部，农业生产、农民支援前线及参军与农村反封建斗争的五部，抗日战争与土地革命等历史故事的四部，其他关于少数民族、学生运动的四部。
    该局除计划摄制切合广大工农群众需要的，以宣传各项时事政策及科学知识为主的通俗故事短片与科学教育片外，并为更好地与私营电影业进行合作，已商得昆仑、长江两制片公司同意，以该两公司为基础，在上海合组一公私合营的“中华联合电影公司”，并决定先从合约制片入手（即先由公方与昆仑、长江两公司分别订立生产总合同，每片开拍前订立分合同），逐步走到完全的公私合营。联合电影公司即将在上海正式成立，并已拟定本年制片计划为《千夫所指》、《真爱》、《我们夫妇之间》、《第二战线》、《穆汉祥传》、《生命的开始》、《新方向》等故事片八部，其中《千夫所指》已在六月份开拍，《真爱》与《第二战线》日内即可开拍。
