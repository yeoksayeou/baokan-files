[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Education Workers' Union Congress, which began on the 19th of this month and lasted for five days, successfully concluded on the 23rd.

Each representative group discussed these speeches and clarified that the union's task should be oriented towards teaching. In order to do well and continuously reform and improve teaching work, the current basic key is for members to strengthen their political, professional, and cultural studies to improve their own levels. At the general meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd, representatives from each group spoke, unanimously expressing their warm support for this.

School workers Yan Lin and Liu Yong raised their fists and said, "The great unity of Beijing education workers is a huge force for winning peace. If the people of the world are united and organized in this way, imperialism will be completely isolated and defeated."

The congress expressed deep concern for the Korean people who are heroically fighting against American imperialism and unanimously passed a telegram of tribute to the Korean People's Army.

    向你们致以热烈的兄弟的敬礼！”
