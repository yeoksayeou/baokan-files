The Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau Accepts Criticism from This Newspaper
Examines Bureaucratic Work Style
Handles the Lianhuasi Quarry Incident

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Following the news published in this newspaper on June 14th regarding the Lianhuasi Quarry incident caused by the bureaucratic work style of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, the acting director of the sub-bureau, Yuan Boyang, deputy director Wang Zhiheng, and military representative Yang Shusheng sent a letter to this newspaper on June 23rd, expressing their sincere acceptance of the criticism and reporting on the sub-bureau's inspection work and correction of errors. The letter is as follows:

The People's Daily published Comrade Chen Ji's report on the problems existing in the work of the Xi'an Sub-bureau. The criticism is correct, and we welcome and sincerely accept it. Indeed, the work of the Xi'an Sub-bureau has remained at a backward level for the past year, which is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of our leading cadres. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to these serious problems ideologically, and we did not consciously and promptly examine and correct them, which affected the progress of our work. In the past two months, we have continuously recognized the seriousness of these problems from the review of our work and have begun to arouse our vigilance and attention. We are now examining our past work from all aspects and conducting a comprehensive review. In order to combine review with action, we have adopted a method of examining and correcting at the same time. For example, regarding the problems of the Lianhuasi ballast yard illegally occupying farmland, damaging seedlings, and harming the interests of farmers, in addition to providing appropriate compensation in cooperation with the government and farmers' associations according to the acreage occupied and the number of damaged seedlings, we also held a farmers' meeting, where our leading cadres made a review and formal apology. The problem of contractors excessively exploiting workers has also been initially corrected; and we are discussing with the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Ministry of Labor how to lead and control this aspect of work in the future. The sub-bureau has dispatched Comrade Wang Baoquan to be stationed at the Lianhuasi ballast yard to represent the sub-bureau in unifying the leadership and control of the work there and to solve the coordination and cooperation problems in all aspects. We have also researched and formulated plans for ballast production, loading, track expansion and repair, and ensuring transportation, so that the work is coordinated and consistent. Other aspects of the sub-bureau's work are also gradually improving. As for the past waste phenomenon and the unclear entanglement with contractors in Lianhuasi, we are urging the relevant units to calculate and deal with it. A comprehensive review of the entire work and leadership style of the sub-bureau is continuing. In short, we are determined to correct past errors and shortcomings in order to improve our work.

    西安铁路分局接受本报批评
    检查官僚主义作风
    处理莲花寺石场事件
    【本报讯】六月十四日本报发表西安铁路分局因官僚主义作风造成莲花寺石场连续发生事件的消息后，该分局代理局长袁伯扬、副局长王志恒、军事代表杨树生已于六月二十三日致函本报，表示诚恳接受批评，并报告该分局检查工作和纠正错误的情况。来函如下：
    人民日报刊载陈迹同志所报道的西安分局工作中存在的问题，对我们的批评是正确的，我们很欢迎并诚恳地接受。的确，西安分局一年来的工作仍然是处于落后的水平，这与我们领导干部的官僚主义是分不开的。过去我们对这些严重的毛病，思想上重视不足，没有清醒地及时地加以检查与纠正，以致影响了工作的进步。近两月来，我们才不断地从工作的检讨中明确地认识到这些问题的严重性，开始引起了我们的警惕与注意。现正从各方面检查我们过去的工作，展开全面的检讨。为了做到检讨与行动相结合，采取了一面检讨一面纠正的方法。如莲花寺石碴场乱占民田损毁青苗，危害农民利益等问题，除按占用地亩及毁青苗数，协同政府与农会做了适当的赔偿外，并召开了农民大会，由我们领导干部做了检讨与正式道歉。包商额外剥削工人的问题也已初步纠正；并正商同西北军政委会、劳动部研讨今后如何领导与掌握这方面的事情。分局派王宝泉同志专驻莲花寺石碴场，代表分局统一领导掌握该地工作，解决各方面联系配合等问题。对石碴生产、装车、展修股道、保证运输等都研究制订出计划，使工作协调一致。分局其他方面的工作，也正逐渐改进。至于莲花寺过去浪费现象与包商纠缠不清的问题，正在督促有关单位计算处理中。关于分局整个工作与领导作风的全面检讨，正在继续进行。总之，我们有决心纠正以往的错误与毛病以改进工作。
