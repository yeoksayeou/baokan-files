Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. More than 9 million people in Northeast China have signed the Peace Declaration. Currently, the peace signature campaign in cities is generally nearing its end, and another signature high tide is developing extensively in rural areas. The people of Northeast China have warmly expressed their firm will to defend world peace, and participation in the peace signature campaign is extremely widespread in various regions. Two-thirds of the cities and counties in Liaodong Province are conducting the peace signature campaign, with 1,003,000 people signing. The number of signatories in cities across the province is generally around 70 to 80 percent. In Jilin Province, 25 out of 27 cities and counties have launched the signature campaign, with 1.6 million people signing. In Jilin City, signatories account for more than 80 percent of the city's population. In other cities such as Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Jinzhou, and Chifeng, more than two-thirds of the people have participated in the signature campaign. Among the 216,000 railway employees in Northeast China, 203,000 have signed.

After the signature campaign moved into rural areas, in-depth propaganda was carried out extensively through village meetings, women's association meetings, door-to-door publicity, meetings at doorways, and chats during evening cool-offs. The campaign is developing exceptionally rapidly. In the suburbs of Shenyang, more than half of the administrative villages, with a total of over 200,000 farmers, have participated in the signature campaign. In Sujiatun District, signatories account for 98 percent of the district's population. In Lihe District, Changchun County, Jilin Province, signatories also account for half of the district's population. In Bianyan Village, Liuhe County, Liaodong Province, during the busy summer hoeing season, meetings were held for two evenings to promote the campaign, and 80 percent of the farmers participated in signing.

According to the recent resolution of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the progress of the signature campaign in the Northeast region, various people's organizations in Northeast China have issued notices calling on all parts of the region to further expand the signature campaign during the "July 1st" to "July 7th" Peace Signature Campaign Week. The signature campaign throughout the region will conclude at the end of July.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. The peace signature campaign to defend world peace in various parts of East China is developing rapidly.

Signature fever has swept across all cities in the region. The majority of organized masses have signed, and this movement is gradually penetrating into the unorganized masses and has generally expanded from cities to the vast rural areas. The number of farmers who have signed in Shandong Province has reached 1 million. In the Second District of Changle County, Fujian Province, participants in the signature campaign account for more than half of the district's total population. In Shangxian District, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, 80 percent of the villagers in 26 villages have signed. After the signature campaign was launched in Xiyouli Village, Fuyang County, people were still coming from three miles away with lanterns in the middle of the night to sign. In the rural suburbs of Wuhu, groups of rural women gathered to sign while beating gongs and drums.

Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army have resolutely expressed their determination to defend world peace in the signature campaign. At a peace signature rally of a certain unit of the East China Military Region, commanders and fighters held guns in one hand and pens in the other, signing amid the solemn sound of bugles and taking solemn oaths. The oath said: "Our pens warn the warmongers to stop their conspiracy to launch war. If they dare to launch war, our guns will give them a annihilating blow."

Also Reported: The Shanghai peace signature campaign is expanding from organized masses to the broad masses of citizens and suburban farmers. As of June 27, according to incomplete statistics, the number of signatories has reached 882,311. Together with those who have signed but have not yet reported to the peace sub-committees, it is estimated to be close to 1 million. Among them are more than 300,000 workers and 11,000 farmers. More than 85 percent of the workers in the Shanghai Electric Power Company have signed the Peace Declaration. Suburban farmers have also enthusiastically shown their determination to defend world peace. More than 2,400 members of the Jiangwan District Farmers' Association have signed one after another.
