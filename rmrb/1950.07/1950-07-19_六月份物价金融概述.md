Overview of Prices and Finance in June
    Yang Fangxun
        Prices
    National prices rose slightly in June. According to the index of 25 commodities in major administrative regions, the overall increase for the month was 5.5 percent. The fluctuations of various commodities varied: grain was stable, cotton yarn increased by 3 percent, and sundry goods (including vulcanized blue, alkali noodles, newsprint, matches, tires, cigarettes, etc.) increased by 12 percent. From a regional perspective, the increases and decreases were not consistent. The Northeast decreased by 3 percent, North China only increased by 1.5 percent, the Southwest had a relatively high increase of 16 percent, and other regions were around 5 percent.
    There were two main reasons for the slight increase in prices in June: First, state-owned trading organizations actively adjusted prices. Based on seasonal supply and demand conditions, regional differences, and wholesale and retail differences, state-owned trading companies made appropriate adjustments to certain commodities on the basis of stable prices in May. Some were raised, some were lowered. Prices in the Southwest were lower in May, so trading companies purchased at higher prices, raising prices. For example, on June 12th, the market price of 20-count Red Goose yarn in Chengdu was 4.8 million yuan, and the local cotton yarn company purchased it at a high price of 5 million yuan. This is the main reason for the relatively large price increase in the Southwest. Second, the demand for some goods needed to be increased, and unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. For example, after the government vigorously commissioned processing and ordering, industry and commerce gradually recovered, and the demand for industrial equipment increased, leading to purchases. Unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, leading to a larger increase in imported goods. Tianjin rose by as much as 26 percent. This is worthy of attention.
    Due to the adjustments made by state-owned trading organizations and the increase in market demand, listed prices and market prices have become close to balanced, and wholesale prices and retail prices have become profitable for private merchants. Only regional differences are not reasonable enough. Taking grain and yarn in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou as examples, the close balance between listed prices and market prices is more obvious:

Region       Rice Market Price       Listed Price (per jin)       20-count Yarn Market Price    Listed Price (per piece)
Shanghai       1,590 yuan                  1,474 yuan                           5.4 million yuan               5.45 million yuan
Tianjin          950 yuan                     950 yuan                           6 million yuan                  5.9 million yuan
Hankou         1,030 yuan                 1,000 yuan                           5.8 million yuan               5.81 million yuan

    As for the adjustment of wholesale and retail prices, the profit control and calculation of various industries and commodities by trade institutions are not sufficient and lack experience, resulting in some retail price differences being too large, while others are too small. For example, on June 29th, the retail price of white fine cloth in Tianjin was 5 percent higher than the wholesale price; in Shanghai, it was 14 percent higher; and in Xi'an Yanta cloth, it was only 3 percent higher. Regional price differences are still not completely reasonable. Taking Tianjin Victory tires as an example, on June 27th, the price in Tianjin was 85,000 yuan, while the price in Taiyuan was 84,000 yuan, which was 1,000 yuan lower than Tianjin; the price in Xinxiang was 87,000 yuan, only 2,000 yuan higher than Tianjin. Such differences will affect the transportation of private merchants, so further adjustments are still needed.
    In June, the market gradually became active, and transaction volume gradually increased. Here is a comparison of the transaction situation of several major commodities in Shanghai in late June and late May:

                          Late May                    Late June                     June compared to May  Percentage Increase/Decrease
Flour (bags)             37,833                       13,666                           Decreased by 63.9
Rice (jin)             5,656,979                   13,233,460                     Increased by 133.9
Cotton (jin)           1,662,800                    1,930,050                     Increased by 16.1
Yarn (bundles)       3,976                        5,586                             Increased by 40.5

        Finance
    In June, the deposit, loan, and remittance businesses of public and private banks and firms became more developed with the market's activity and the increase in commodity transactions. However, securities, gold, and silver experienced fluctuations.
        Interest Rates
    In June, the deposit and loan interest rates of the state banks basically did not change. The deposit interest rates of private banks and firms increased slightly. For example, the monthly interest rate for current deposits in Shanghai private banks and firms increased from 5 per mille to 7 per mille on June 17th. In Tianjin, the daily interest rate per thousand yuan increased from 2 jiao to 3.2 fen.
            Deposits
    In June, deposits in public and private banks continued to increase. According to statistics from seven major cities, the deposit balance of state banks on May 31st was 4810 billion yuan, and on June 30th it was 5850 billion yuan, an increase of 21.6 percent. The deposit balance of private banks and firms on May 27th was 810 billion yuan, and on June 24th it was 840 billion yuan, an increase of 3.7 percent. The relatively large increase in deposits in state banks is mainly the result of the active implementation of cash management work in various regions.
            Loans
    In order to support the development of industry and commerce, the amount of loans from the financial industry has been continuously increasing. According to statistics from seven major cities, the loan balance of private banks and firms on May 27th was 390 billion yuan, and on June 24th it was 480 billion yuan, an increase of 23.1 percent. The loan balance of state banks to private enterprises was 280 billion yuan at the end of May and 350 billion yuan at the end of June, an increase of 25 percent.
            Remittances
    With the increase in market transactions and the gradual activation of the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the amount of remittances is also increasing. According to statistics from seven major cities, the total amount of remittances in and out of state banks in early June was 4080 billion yuan, an increase of 24.8 percent compared with late May. The total amount of remittances in and out of private banks and firms in the first week of June was 390 billion yuan, an increase of 27.9 percent compared with the fourth week of May.
            Securities and Gold and Silver
    The most speculative elements in the financial market are securities and gold and silver. In late June, due to the disturbances of speculators and saboteurs, there were fluctuations for a time. Stock prices fell, and gold and silver prices rose. The price of Qixin stocks in Tianjin on the 24th was 1.6 million per 100,000 shares (the market was closed on Sunday the 25th), but on the 26th it fell to 1.12 million, a decrease of 30 percent. The price of gold in Shanghai on the 26th was 1.27 million per tael, and on the 30th it rose to 1.37 million, an increase of 7.9 percent. Although the fluctuations of securities and gold and silver did not affect the fluctuations of major prices, it also shows that there is still floating capital in the market that has not been invested in proper channels, and that speculators and saboteurs who have not given up are attempting to attack our already stable prices and finance. This is worthy of our high attention and vigilance.

　　六月份物价金融概述
    杨方勋
        物价
    六月份全国物价略有上升。根据各大行政区二十五种商品指数来看，全月上涨了百分之五点五。各种商品起伏的幅度不一，粮食平稳，花纱布上升百分之三，杂货类（包括硫化青、碱面、白报纸、火柴、外胎、纸烟等）上涨百分之十二。从地区来看，涨落也不一致，东北下落百分之三，华北只涨百分之一点五，西南涨得较高，为百分之十六，其他地区均为百分之五左右。
    六月份物价微升，主要原因有二：一是国家贸易机关主动调整价格。国营贸易公司根据季节性的供求情况，地区的差额，批发与零售的差额，在五月份物价平稳的基础上，曾对某些商品进行了适当的调整。有的调高，有的调低。五月份西南区物价较低，贸易公司则以高价收购，提高价格。如六月十二日成都二十支红雁纱市价四百八十万元，当地花纱布公司曾以五百万元大价收购。这是西南区物价上涨较多的主要原因。二是若干物品需要增加，奸商乘机抬高价格。如政府大力委托加工、订货后，工商业逐渐恢复，对工业器材等需要增加，纷纷购买，奸商又乘机哄抬捣乱，致进口货上涨幅度较大，天津曾涨至百分之二十六。这是值得提起注意的。
    由于国营贸易机关的调整，市场需要的增加，牌价和市价已接近平衡，批发价和零售价已使私商有利可图，仅地区间差额还不够合理。以上海、天津、汉口三地粮、纱为例，牌价和市价的接近平衡已较明显：地区      大米市价      牌价（斤）       廿支纱市价      牌价（件）  上海   一、五九○元    一、四七四元         五四○万元  五四五万元  天津    九五○元        九五○元            六○○万元   五九○万元 汉口   一、○三○元     一、○○○元     五八○万元    五八一万元
    至于批发价和零售价的调整，因贸易机构对各种行业和商品利润掌握与计算的不够，经验不多，以致有的零售价与批发价差额较大，有的则又较小。如六月二十九日，天津白细布零售较批发高百分之五；上海高百分之十四；西安雁塔布仅高百分之三。地区间的差价，则仍不完全合理。以天津胜利外胎为例，六月二十七日，天津价八万五千元，而太原八万四千元，反较天津低一千元；新乡八万七千元，仅较天津高二千元。这样的差额，就会影响私商的贩运，因此仍须继续调整。
    在六月份，市场已渐趋活跃，成交量逐渐增多。现将上海市几种主要商品六月下旬和五月下旬的成交情况比较如下：
   五月下旬              六月下旬        六月比五月  增减百分比面粉（袋）  三七、八三三         一三、六六六           减六三·九大米（斤）五、六五六、九七九  一三、二三三、四六○    增一三三·九棉花（斤）一、六六二、八○○  一、九三○、○五○      增一六·一纱（捆）  三、九七六          五、五八六              增四○·五
        金融
    六月份公私行庄的存款、放款、汇兑等业务，随着市场活跃，商品成交增多，而更加开展。只是证券、金、银曾发生波动。
        利率
    六月份，国家银行的存放款利息，基本上没有什么变动。私营行庄的存款利息略有增加。如上海私营行庄六月十七日活期存款每元月息，由五厘改为七厘。天津每千元日息，由二角改为三角二分。
            存款
    六月份，公私银行的存款继续增加。根据七大城市统计，五月三十一日国家银行存款余额为四万八千一百亿元，六月三十日为五万八千五百亿元，增加了百分之二一·六。私营行庄五月二十七日存款余额是八千一百亿元，六月二十四日是八千四百亿元，增加了百分之三·七。国家银行存款增加较多，主要是各地积极开展现金管理工作的结果。
            放款
    为了扶助工商业发展，金融业放款金额不断增加。根据七大城市统计，私营行庄五月二十七日放款余额是三千九百亿元，六月二十四日是四千八百亿元，增加了百分之二三·一。国家银行对私营企业的放款余额是：五月底二千八百亿元，六月底三千五百亿元，增加了百分之二五。
            汇兑
    随着市场交易增多，城乡物资交流逐渐活跃，汇兑额亦在增加。根据七大城市统计，国家银行六月上旬汇出汇入总额是四万零八千亿元，比五月下旬增加百分之二四·八。私营行庄六月份第一周汇出入总额三千九百亿元，比五月份第四周增加百分之二七·九。
            证券与金银
    金融市场中投机性最大的是证券与金银，六月下旬曾因投机分子和破坏分子的捣乱，一度波动，股票价落，金银价涨。天津启新股票二十四日每十万股价格一百六十万（二十五日星期日停市），二十六日即落至一百一十二万，下落百分之三十。上海黄金，二十六日每两一百二十七万，三十日即涨至一百三十七万，上涨了百分之七·九。证券与金银的波动，虽则没有影响到主要物价的波动，但也说明了市场上还有游资没有投向正当途径，准备待机而动，尚未死心的投机分子和破坏分子，正企图袭击我们的已经稳定的物价和金融。这是值得引起我们高度注意和警惕的。
