Hebei Farm's Awarding Work

By Our Special Correspondent Zhou Ziqin

After Hebei Farm in Shijiazhuang implemented the collective contract system, most workers were able to meet their efficiency quotas, and more than half exceeded them. To fulfill the contract's stipulations of "fixed efficiency, rewards for exceeding quotas" and "monthly evaluations, quarterly awards," Hebei Farm conducted its first quarterly awarding process.

This awarding was conducted through a highly democratic approach, implementing the mass line, with organization and leadership. First, the leadership drafted preliminary awarding standards, grades, and award amounts. They then convened key workers and activists for detailed discussion and research, revising the standards before submitting them to the workers for review and decision. Finally, based on the awarding standards, each individual was assessed and graded.

The first issue to be resolved in the awarding process was the matter of mass-based awarding standards. These could be roughly divided into the following: 1. Based on the number of times work efficiency exceeded the quota in a month, quality, and a willingness to actively take responsibility for work without fixed quotas. 2. The ability to lead the entire team or group, leveraging collective capabilities, to exceed efficiency quotas. If not holding leadership responsibility, then demonstrating an active leadership role with significant initiative. 3. Working steadily and diligently with few absences and many workdays in a month. 4. Demonstrating significant actions in protecting public property. 5. Strictly enforcing the regulations set by the farm and obeying leaders at all levels. 6. Maintaining a friendly attitude and the ability to unite the masses. 7. Being actively responsible and consistently providing reasonable suggestions. 8. The ability to engage in self-criticism and mutual criticism, and to accept criticism and correct mistakes.

Among these eight standards, the first three were the focus of the awarding standards, accounting for sixty points of the total score of one hundred. The distribution of points for each item was determined based on the situation of the workers, the needs of the work, and the intentions of the leadership in each quarter. This ensured flexibility so that the awarding could play a certain role. In this quarter, considering collective over-fulfillment of quotas and absences due to leave, the second and third items were given equal weight to the first item, with each receiving twenty points. As for the last five items, each was worth eight points, totaling forty points. At the same time, based on the awarding standards, grades and award amounts were specified: First Grade: Must be above ninety points, award forty jin of millet; Second Grade: Must be above seventy points, award twenty-five jin of millet; Third Grade: Must be above sixty points, award fifteen jin of millet. As a result of the assessment, twenty-seven of the forty-one workers received the first glorious bonus after the implementation of the collective contract.

The benefits of this awarding were: 1. It pointed out a common direction of effort for all workers. After the awarding, workers had clear goals and directions in work, life, action, style, and politics. 2. Providing material rewards to active workers can consistently maintain their work enthusiasm. Workers who received awards stated that they would work even harder in the future. 3. It pointed out the future and hope for lagging workers. In this awarding, several workers who were lagging behind last year had made progress this year, with changes and achievements in their work. This shows that as long as lagging workers strive to correct their shortcomings, they can still gain the support of the masses and have the hope of receiving rewards. 5. It implemented the intentions of the leadership. Through the awarding, the leadership can effectively grasp the deviations that occur in the work in each quarter, educate the workers, and gradually correct them. For example, in this quarter, there were not many units that collectively exceeded efficiency quotas, so this point was made one of the important standards in the awarding to encourage the development of collective capabilities and exceeding quotas.

The awarding process went relatively smoothly. However, some deviations occurred during the process: First, there was a prevalence of egalitarianism among the workers. Some workers advocated for more bonus grades, smaller differences in amounts, and broader standards. Some argued that the ten percent of the total wages of the workers for bonuses (equivalent to six hundred and forty jin of millet) should be entirely distributed to those who received awards, without fixing the amount of the bonus. Second, there was only attention to praising the strengths of each individual, without appropriate criticism and self-criticism. After the leadership discovered these deviations, they immediately conducted in-depth enlightenment and education, pointing out the errors of egalitarianism and the importance of criticism and self-criticism. The deviations were corrected in a timely manner, and the awarding work was enthusiastically carried out.

What are the lessons learned? 1. Awarding must be carried out on schedule so that the leadership can establish authority. This is to strengthen the workers' confidence in implementing the contract. Otherwise, it will cause the workers to doubt and affect their work enthusiasm. 2. Awarding standards must have a focus and be flexibly applied according to objective and specific circumstances in order to play a certain role. 3. Awarding must promote democracy and implement the mass line. This work must be regarded as extremely cautious and serious. It must "reward those who deserve to be rewarded" in order to put everyone at ease and make the awarding achieve the due results. Therefore, it must be handed over to the workers themselves, but it must be carried out in an organized and led manner. 4. After the awarding, attention should be paid to the reactions of the workers and the masses. For individuals who are upset because they did not receive an award, individual talks should be conducted immediately to persuade and educate them, and appropriate spiritual encouragement should be given. This is the only way to achieve a comprehensive effect of the awarding.

### 河北农场的评奖工作

　　河北农场的评奖工作
    本报特派记者  周子芹
    石家庄河北农场实施集体合同后，大部分工人都能完成效率定额，并有一半以上的人超过定额。为了履行合同中“定额效率，超额奖励”“一月一评，一季一奖”的规定，河北农场曾进行了第一季评奖工作。
    这次评奖是采取了高度发扬民主、贯彻群众路线的办法，有组织有领导地进行的。首先由领导上拟出了初步的评奖标准，等级及奖额等，召集工人中的骨干及积极分子，进行详尽讨论研究，修改后再交工人审查决定，最后根据评奖标准，对每个人进行评定等级。
    评奖中首先要解决的，就是群众性的评奖标准问题。大致可分为下面几项：一、以一个月中工作效率超过定额的次数、质量及对未订定额的工作肯积极负责为标准。二、能领导全体或全组、发挥集体能力，超过效率定额。不负领导责任，则以能积极带头工作，有显著之自动性为标准。三、在一个月中，工作踏踏实实，缺勤很少，工作日数多；四、对保护公物上有显著事实；五、严格执行场方规定的纪律，并服从各级领导；六、态度和气，能团结群众；七、积极负责，并经常提供合理建议；八、能进行自我批评，互相批评，并能接受批评，勇于改正。
    这八项标准中，前三项是评奖标准中的重点，在总分数一百分中共占六十分，每一项分数如何分配，则根据每一季中工人的情况，工作的需要，及领导上的意图决定其比重。这样才能发挥其灵活性，使评奖能起一定的作用。这一季考虑集体超额和请假缺勤的情况，把第二、三项和第一项列为同等比重，每项二十分，至于后五项的分数是每项八分，共四十分。同时并根据评奖标准，规定了等级和奖额：一等：须在九十分以上，奖小米四十斤；二等：须在七十分以上，奖小米二十五斤；三等：须在六十分以上，奖小米十五斤。评定结果，全体四十一个工人中，有二十七名获得了集体合同实施后第一次光荣奖金。
    这次评奖的收获：一、给全体工人指出了一个共同努力的方向。在评奖之后，工人中无论在工作上、生活上、行动上、作风上、政治上都有了明确的目标和方向。二、给积极工人以物质的奖励，可经常保持其工作热情。得奖以后的工人都表示以后要更努力干。三、给落后工人指出前途和希望。这次评奖中，几个在去年还是落后的工人，一年有了进步，在工作上有了转变和成绩。这说明落后工人只要努力改正自己的缺点，仍然能获得群众的拥护，也有获得奖励的希望。五、贯彻了领导意图。通过评奖，领导上可以很好的掌握住各季中工作上所发生的偏向，对工人进行教育，逐步纠正。例如这一季中，单位集体超过效率定额的还不多，评奖时即将这一点作为重要标准之一，以鼓励发挥集体能力，超过定额。
    这次评奖工作进行是比较顺利的。但在进行中也发生了一些偏向：第一是工人中存在平均主义思想，有的工人就主张奖金等级要多，差额要小，标准要宽；有的主张工人总工资十分之一的奖金（合六百四十斤小米），应全部分配给得奖的人，不固定奖金数目。第二是只注意了表扬每个人的优点，而没有作适当的批评与自我批评。领导上发现了这些偏向后，立即又进行了深入的启发和教育，指出平均主义思想的错误，及批评与自我批评的重要性。及时改正了偏向，评奖工作得以热烈展开。
    经验是什么呢？一、评奖一定要按期执行，领导才可以树立威信。以加强工人贯彻合同的信心，否则就会引起了工人的怀疑而影响其工作积极性。二、评奖标准要有重心，并根据客观具体情况灵活运用，才能发挥其一定的作用。三、评奖必须发扬民主，贯彻群众路线，要把这个工作看成极慎重严肃的工作，要“奖其当奖”，才能使大家心平气和，才能使评奖收到应得的成绩。因此，必须交给工人自己来作，但必须有组织、有领导的进行。四、评奖后，应注意工人群众的反映：对个别因未得奖而闹情绪的人，应即进行个别谈话加以说服教育，并予以适当的精神鼓励，这样才能使评奖获得全面效果。
