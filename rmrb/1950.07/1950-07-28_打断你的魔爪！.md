　　Break Your Claws!
　　After the news was published in the newspaper that American imperialism was using armed force to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, interfering in Korea's internal affairs, and disrupting world peace, the workers in our team were all extremely indignant! I, representing the 1,200 workers of the Suihua Locomotive Depot, warn the warmonger Truman: Taiwan is the Taiwan of the Chinese people. If you dare to obstruct us from liberating it, we will definitely give you a severe lesson. You are nothing more than a paper tiger. We, the Chinese people, defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and also repelled your American aggression on the Chinese mainland. Our strength has become even greater. If you dare to extend your claws of aggression, we will give you a head-on blow, break your claws, and send you rolling into the graves of Hitler, Mussolini... ! Now, our workers are exerting even greater effort, intensifying production, eliminating all accidents, carrying out the Iron Ox movement well, and supporting the people's army to quickly liberate Taiwan and Tibet.

　　打断你的魔爪！
    报纸上发表美帝国主义武装干涉中国人民解放台湾，干涉朝鲜内政，破坏世界和平的消息后，我队工友们都十分愤慨！我代表绥化机务段一千二百名工友警告战争贩子杜鲁门：台湾是中国人民的台湾，你若敢阻挠我们去解放，一定狠狠地给你一个教训。你不过是一只纸老虎，我们中国人民打败了日本帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮，也击退了你们美国在中国大陆上的侵略势力，我们的力量已经更加壮大起来，你若敢伸出侵略的魔手，我们将给你迎头一棒，打断你的魔爪，叫你滚到希特勒、墨索里尼……的坟墓里去！现在我们工友正发挥自己更大的力量，加紧生产，消灭一切事故，搞好铁牛运动，支援人民大军迅速解放台湾、西藏。
