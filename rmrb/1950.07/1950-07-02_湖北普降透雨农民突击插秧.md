　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th. Widespread heavy rain in most areas of Hubei Province on the 27th and 28th has greatly alleviated the drought in the mountainous areas of northeastern Hubei. Since the beginning of summer, the province has had two rainfalls, but the amount of rain was small, so a serious drought occurred in the area along the north bank of the Yangtze River, along the Dabie and Dahong Mountains, with a population of about five million. According to statistics from twelve counties in the Huanggang and Xiaogan areas, approximately 1.9 million mu of rice fields have not been transplanted. In order to combat the drought, the local people's governments have led farmers to carry out drought-resistant planting. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has loaned more than 200 water pumps to farmers in drought-stricken areas and sent special personnel to Henan and Hunan provinces to purchase drought-resistant crops and late rice seeds. Among them, 300,000 jin of late rice seeds purchased from Henan were shipped to Xiaogan area on the 24th and loaned to disaster-stricken farmers. After the rainfall, farmers in the Dabie Mountains, where the rice transplanting season is later, are working hard to plow and transplant rice seedlings. In other areas where the rice transplanting season has passed, farmers are rushing to plant drought-resistant crops such as buckwheat, millet, corn, and potatoes. The Xiaogan area has also decided to strive to complete the planting within five days.

　　湖北普降透雨农民突击插秧
    【新华社汉口三十日电】湖北省大部地区在二十七、二十八两日内普降透雨，已使该省东北部山区的受旱程度大为减轻。该省自入夏以来，虽曾两次下雨，但雨量不大，因此在长江北岸沿大别山、大洪山约五百万人口的地区曾发生严重旱象。据黄冈、孝感两专区十二县统计，约有一百九十余万亩稻田未插秧。为了战胜旱灾，上述各地人民政府均曾领导农民进行抗旱点种，省府农林厅贷出抽水机二百余部，分配给受旱地区农民使用，并派专人往河南、湖南两省采购旱地作物和晚稻种子，其中自河南采购到的三十万斤晚稻种子，已于二十四日运抵孝感专区，贷给受灾农民。此次下雨后，大别山区因插秧季节较晚，当地农民正紧张地犁田插秧。其他插秧季节已过的地区，农民们正突击赶种荞麦、粟谷、玉蜀黍、马铃薯等旱地作物。孝感专区并决定争取在五天内赶种完毕。
