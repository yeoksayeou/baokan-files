　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st. According to Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, July 20th, the Indian News Chronicle, sponsored by members of the Indian National Congress, published a commentary saying: "Acheson's note to Nehru has shattered hopes for an early restoration of peace." "Acheson is fanatically worshipful of power politics, which so far can only be combined with totalitarian rule." The newspaper believes: "Acheson's reply offends the spirit of world peace." Commenting on the American argument that the Korean People's Army must first withdraw to the 38th parallel before peace negotiations can begin, the newspaper said: "Planting the United Nations flag on the 38th parallel does not mean peace." According to Agence France-Presse, many other English-language newspapers in India also criticized Acheson's note, and local newspapers were particularly fierce.

　　印报纸抨击艾奇逊
    【新华社二十一日讯】据法新社新德里二十日电，印度国大党党员主办的印度新闻纪事报发表评论说：“艾奇逊致尼赫鲁的照会打破了早日恢复和平的希望。”“艾奇逊疯狂地崇拜强权主义，而这种强权主义迄今为止都只有与集权统治才能结合在一起。”该报认为：“艾奇逊的答复冒犯了世界和平的精神”。在评论美国的论点，即朝鲜人民军必须先退回三八线然后才能开始和平谈判时，该报说：“把联合国旗帜插在三八线上并不就意味着和平。”据法新社电称，印度其他许多英文报纸也都抨击艾奇逊的照会，当地报纸格外激烈。
