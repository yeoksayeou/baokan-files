　　The "Iron" Unit of North Gyeongsang Province
　　One Story from the South Korean Guerrilla Zone
　　In January of this year, in the Cheongsong area of North Gyeongsang Province, a people's guerrilla unit called "Iron" fought continuously from the 4th to the 9th. This unit, in coordination with over 700 peasants who had risen up, executed many local bullies and reactionaries, and engaged in fierce battles with the 1st Battalion and 3rd Company of the puppet National Defense Army's 25th Regiment stationed in nearby areas, achieving great results.

　　At 10:30 PM on the night of January 4th, the "Iron" guerrilla unit, holding high the Republic's flag adorned with a brilliant five-pointed red star, stormed into the villages of Sangui-dong and Haui-dong. Over 300 peasants from the two villages, who bitterly hated the traitor Syngman Rhee, bravely cooperated with the people's guerrilla unit's actions, wielding wooden clubs, sickles, and shovels to search for local bullies, reactionaries, and their lackeys who had fled upon hearing the news. The villains ultimately could not escape the people's judgment and were captured one by one. At a mass meeting, the people judged their crimes, and those with heinous offenses were shot.

　　At 3:10 AM on the 7th, the "Iron" unit launched a surprise attack on the 3rd Company of the puppet National Defense Army's 25th Regiment stationed in Andeok District, Cheongsong County, in three directions. The people's guerrilla unit employed a tactic of luring the enemy, initially using small detachments to fire sporadically. Once the enemy troops were lured within effective range, the ambushing unit on the right flank immediately opened fire fiercely. When the puppet National Defense Army resisted towards the right flank, the ambushing unit on the left flank then opened fire, completely throwing the puppet troops into chaos. They realized they were trapped in an unfavorable encirclement and attempted to escape. However, the puppet troops caught in the net were met with a fierce attack from another special detachment. As a result, the majority of the puppet troops were annihilated.

　　Having achieved the above victories, the "Iron" unit, on the morning of the 9th, launched a surprise attack on the 1st Battalion of the puppet National Defense Army's 25th Regiment, which was encamped at Juwang Mountain in Sangpyeong Village, Budong District, Cheongsong County. As the battle began, guerrilla fighters carrying hand grenades approached the enemy's encampment from three directions. The loud explosions of hand grenades and the enemy's screams and cries of pain were mixed together. After the grenade throwers completed their bombing mission, the machine gunners immediately conducted strafing. The puppet National Defense Army, under attack from three sides, intended to resist while fleeing along the ridge. However, another special detachment was already waiting there, delivering a head-on blow to the fleeing enemy. In this battle, more than 40 enemies were killed, more than 20 were injured, and one machine gun and more than 30 automatic rifles were captured. Singing songs of victory, the "Iron" people's guerrilla unit returned to its base.

　　庆尚北道的“钢铁”部队
    朝鲜南部游击区故事之一
    今年一月间，在庆尚北道的青松地区，一支叫做“钢铁”的人民游击队，从四日到九日，连续战斗。这支队伍配合着七百余起义的农民，处决了很多恶霸和反动分子，并对驻在附近地区警备的伪国防军第二十五团第一营和第三连展开了激战，获得很大的战果。
    一月四日夜间十点三十分，“钢铁”游击队高举着五角红星灿烂的共和国国旗，一举攻入了上义洞和下义洞两个村庄。对李承晚卖国贼痛恨入骨的两村三百余农民，持着木棒、镰刀和铁锹，英勇地配合着人民游击队的行动，搜捕闻声潜逃的恶霸、反动分子和他们的狗腿。坏蛋们终于逃不脱人民的裁判，一个个都被抓到了。在群众大会上，人民审判了他们的罪行，罪大恶极的被枪毙了。
    七日晨三点十分，“钢铁”部队分三路奇袭驻在青松县安德区的伪国防军第二十五团第三连。人民游击队运用着诱敌战术，最初使用小股兵力，分散着射击。等到敌军被诱至有效射程以内，右翼的埋伏部队立即猛烈射击，伪国防军向右翼进行抵抗时，左翼埋伏部队随即开火，伪军乃完全陷入混乱，他们明白已陷于被包围的不利情况，企图逃跑。但是陷入罗网的伪军们又遭到另一支别动部队的猛攻，结果，伪军大部被歼灭了。
    获得以上战绩的“钢铁”部队，于九日晨，奇袭在青松县府东区上平村的朱旺山宿营的伪国防军第二十五团第一营。战斗开始了，带着手榴弹的游击战士们自三方面摸近敌军的宿营处，手榴弹爆炸的巨响和敌军的悲鸣与痛苦的狂叫乱成一片。投弹手完成轰炸任务后，机枪手随即进行扫射。伪国防军在三面夹攻中，打算一面抵抗，一面沿着山脊逃跑。但是另一支别动部队早在那里等候着，迎头痛击逃敌。这一战斗，计毙敌四十余名，伤二十余名，缴获机枪一挺，自动步枪三十余枝。高唱着胜利凯歌，“钢铁”人民游击队返回根据地了。
