Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th -- Reuter's: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the Korean issue on the 10th. After describing how the South Korean puppet government, under American orders, launched an attack on North Korea, the statement pointed out that this "sinister adventure is the pretext for the American-instigated MacArthur invasion in order to destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, rebuild imperialist rule, and turn the entire Korea into an American bridgehead on the Asian continent. This is the pretext for the American implementation of Wall Street's long-prepared plan to permanently occupy Japan, annex Taiwan, openly interfere in China, reoccupy the Philippines, and support French imperialism's intervention in Indochina." The statement further condemned the Security Council for endorsing American aggression, which greatly undermines the United Nations Charter, and that the actions of the United Nations Secretary-General "are like those of MacArthur's mercenaries." The statement also denounced the Labour government as an accomplice to American aggression, and predicted that if the attack on the Korean people is allowed to continue, it will only be a matter of time before British children die for America's war in Korea. (Reuter's note: Officials announced on the 9th that the British cruiser Jamaica was hit by artillery shells from the Korean People's Army, resulting in the death of five British soldiers and one naval officer.)

The statement called on "all British people to take action and demand that the government withdraw British naval and air forces from Korea. Let the Korean people decide their own affairs. Do not send a single gun to America. The Chinese government must be allowed to participate in the Security Council. Demand that the United States immediately withdraw its troops from Korea. Do not interfere in China. Strive for world peace."

　　不要英国孩子们在朝鲜为美国送死
    英共要求撤退英海空军
    【新华社十二日讯】电通社伦敦讯：英国共产党执行委员会十日就朝鲜问题发表声明。声明在叙述了南朝鲜的傀儡政府在美国命令下如何对北朝鲜发动进攻之后，指出这个“罪恶的冒险，是美国发动麦克阿瑟进犯的借口，以便毁灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，重建帝国主义统治，把整个朝鲜变成美国在亚洲大陆上的桥头阵地。这是美国实行华尔街长期准备的永久占领日本，并吞台湾，公开干涉中国，重新占领菲律宾，支持法国帝国主义干涉印度支那的计划的借口”。声明进一步痛责安理会赞成美国的侵略，大大破坏了联合国宪章，而联合国秘书长的行动“竟如麦克阿瑟的雇佣兵”。声明并斥工党政府是美国侵略的同谋犯，预言如果听任对朝鲜人民的进攻继续下去，那末英国孩子们在朝鲜为美国的战争送死，便只是一个时间问题了。（电通社按：官方九日宣布，英巡洋舰牙买加号被朝鲜人民军炮弹击中，五名英兵与一个海军军官因而毙命。）
    声明号召“全体英国人民行动起来，要求政府撤退在朝鲜的英国海军与飞机。让朝鲜人民自己决定自己的事。不送一支枪给美国。必须允许中国政府参加安理会。要求美国立刻自朝鲜撤军。不要干涉中国。争取世界和平。”
