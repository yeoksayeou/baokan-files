Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 5th:

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to correctly implement the Central Committee's instructions on rectification and carry out the decision of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on implementing the rectification instructions, convened its first Party Representative Conference from May 30th to June 14th. The conference, with a spirit of self-criticism, analyzed the current state of thought and work style of Party members throughout the province and specifically established the methods and steps for rectification. A total of 451 representatives from various regional committees, municipal committees, county committees, and provincial-level units attended the meeting. At the meeting, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, delivered a report on the draft plan for Party rectification and cadre rectification to implement production policies, as well as a self-critical speech by the Provincial Committee on several important policy issues. After heated discussions among the representatives, supplements and revisions were made. Finally, Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee, made a summarizing speech. At the meeting, Lin Tie conveyed Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session, which was discussed by all the representatives, who unanimously adopted a telegram to the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao, expressing their warm support and determination to strive for the victorious completion of the eight tasks pointed out by Chairman Mao.

The conference considered that the Party organization in Hebei Province, after the tempering of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the People's Liberation War, and the Land Reform, as well as the education of the Party Rectification Movement, had greatly developed and improved. The vast majority of the 970,000 Party members in the province (including 300,000 new Party members who joined after the Land Reform and Party Rectification) have a high degree of awareness and can serve the people wholeheartedly. They are conscientious, responsible, and hardworking in leading production and various tasks, thus ensuring the completion of the arduous tasks assigned by the Party and the People's Government in various periods. This is the fundamental and primary aspect. At the same time, due to the victory of the revolutionary war and the relationship of moving from the countryside to the cities, a sense of pride and complacency has grown in many Party members and cadres, resulting in serious bureaucratic and commandist work styles. Among these, the most common and prominent is commandism. The conference pointed out that the purpose of rectification is to overcome bureaucratic and commandist work styles, to improve the ideology and work style of the entire Party, especially the cadre Party members, to strengthen the mass viewpoint, to implement the mass line, to further consolidate the connection between the Party and the masses, and to correctly implement policies and do a good job. The conference considered that rectification is related to the unity within the Party and the unity between the Party and the people, and must be carried out seriously and responsibly, realistically and practically, and with differentiation and step-by-step implementation according to the specific circumstances of each level and different regions and departments. The principle of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" should be adopted, emphasizing the combination of "regular cleaning" and "cleaning campaigns." Party members and cadres who have committed serious mistakes should be given appropriate disciplinary actions; speculative elements and incurable degenerates should be washed away; Party members and cadres who abide by the law, have a correct work style, actively complete the Party's work, and unite the masses should be rewarded and commended. The main method of rectification is to read the designated documents, closely combine with the current tasks, conduct inspections, summarize work, analyze the situation, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Leading cadres must first set an example and conduct self-criticism from top to bottom, so that they can be closely combined with the mass criticism from bottom to top.

Regarding the steps of rectification, the conference decided that before autumn, the work styles of Party member cadres above the county level should be rectified first, while ideological preparation for rectification should be carried out in districts and villages. Each county should select one or two typical village branches to conduct public Party and rectification demonstrations to gain experience. After autumn, the local committees will train district-level Party member cadres in rotation, and the county committees will train village-level Party member cadres in rotation, thereby conducting training for the vast number of Party member cadres, so that the rectification movement can be gradually unfolded in a step-by-step and focused manner. The public opening and rectification work of Party branches must be carried out in a unified manner, and various democratic systems inside and outside the Party must be established and improved in the rectification movement.

All the representatives unanimously agreed that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, the North China Bureau, and the Provincial Committee, with the rich experience of past rectification and Party rectification, and with the enthusiastic help of the working people, this rectification movement will surely be victoriously completed.

　　河北省委召开首次党代表会议
    订出全省整风方法步骤
    【新华社保定五日电】中共河北省委会为正确执行中共中央的整风指示，贯彻中共中央华北局执行整风指示的决定，于五月三十日至六月十四日，召开第一次党代表会议。会议以自我批评的精神，分析了当前全省党员的思想作风的情况，具体订出整风的方法及步骤。出席会议的有各地委、市委、县委及省级各单位代表共四百五十一人。会上省委书记林铁代表省委会作了整党整干贯彻生产政策草案的报告及省委关于几个重要政策问题的自我批评的发言，经代表们热烈讨论后，作了补充和修正。最后由省委副书记马国瑞作了总结性的发言。会议并由林铁传达了毛主席在三中全会上的报告，全体代表讨论后，一致通过致电党中央及毛主席，表示热烈拥护并坚决为毛主席所指出的八项任务的胜利完成而奋斗。
    会议认为：河北省党的组织经过抗日战争、人民解放战争、土地改革的锻炼，及整党运动的教育，有很大的发展与提高。全省九十七万党员（其中有土地改革、整党后入党的新党员三十万），绝大多数有高度的觉悟，能忠心为人民服务；在领导生产与各种工作中，认真负责，艰苦努力，因而保证完成了党与人民政府交付的各个时期的艰巨任务。这是根本的主要的方面。同时，由于革命战争的胜利及由乡村进入城市的关系，在很多党员干部中滋长着一种骄傲自满的情绪，产生了严重的官僚主义和命令主义作风。而其中最普遍最突出的是命令主义。会议指出：整风的目的在于克服官僚主义与命令主义作风，把全党首先是干部党员从思想上作风上提高一步，加强群众观点，贯彻群众路线，进一步巩固党与群众的联系，正确贯彻政策，作好工作。会议认为：整风关系到党内团结及党与人民的团结，必须严肃负责，实事求是，根据各级及不同地区、不同部门的具体情况，有区别有步骤地进行。应采取惩前毖后、治病救人的方针，强调“经常打扫”与“清洁运动”相结合。对犯有重大错误的党员干部应给以适当的纪律处分；对投机分子与不可救药的蜕化分子，应予以洗刷；对奉公守法、作风正派、积极完成党的工作并团结了群众的党员干部，应给予奖励与表扬。整风的方法主要是阅读指定的文件，密切结合当前各项工作任务，通过检查，总结工作，分析情况，开展批评与自我批评。领导干部首先要以身作则，自上而下地进行自我批评，这样，才能和自下而上的群众性批评密切结合起来。
    关于整风的步骤：会议决定：秋季以前先整顿县以上党员干部的作风，同时在区、村进行整风的思想酝酿。各县并选择一、两个典型村支部，进行公开党与整风的示范，以取得经验。秋后，地方委员会轮训区级党员干部，县委会轮训村级党员干部，从而进行对广大党员干部的训练，使整风运动有步骤有重点地逐步展开。党的支部的公开与整风工作必须统一进行，在整风运动中把党内外的各种民主制度建立和健全起来。
    全体代表一致认为：在党中央、华北局及省委的正确领导下，有过去整风整党的丰富经验，有劳动人民的热情帮助，此次整风运动一定能胜利地完成。
