Li Jinquan - An Indomitable Advanced Producer
Lu Niangao

Li Jinquan is an electric welder at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant who successfully trial-produced electric welding rods. Although the quality of the welding rods is slightly inferior to those purchased from outside, the cost is reduced by more than half. External purchases cost 23,400 yuan per kilogram, while his cost only 10,500 yuan per kilogram. The three tons and 350 kilograms of scrap welding rods in stock can be used by adding only 1,050 yuan of welding flux per kilogram. Utilizing scrap welding rods alone will save the country 28,000 jin of millet. If calculated based on the factory's annual use of more than six tons of welding rods, the money saved would be even greater.

The commendable aspect of Li Jinquan's self-made welding rods lies not only in saving the country tens of thousands of jin of millet, but more importantly in the long and continuous struggle he went through for research. This process typically illustrates how a liberated advanced producer overcomes various difficulties and obstacles.

	He spent his own money to buy chemical reagents and conducted experiments at home every day after work.

Since September of last year, he has been determined to research welding flux and vowed not to let the factory spend a penny before the research was successful. He conducted every experiment after work. He didn't have bowls at home, so he used a lot of bottles and jars to hold more than thirty kinds of chemical reagents. Most of these reagents were bought with his own money. He only asked the factory for four bottles of water glass and borrowed less than a pound of yellow prussiate of potash. In addition, there were some materials that could be considered public, which were heavy ash, impregnated asbestos, and glass powder that he ground himself from broken bricks, tiles, and glass in the factory. As for how much money he spent on buying medicine, he had not calculated it. However, a pound of aluminum hydroxide that cost 80,000 yuan had already been used up, and eleven pounds of water glass that cost more than 6,000 yuan per pound had been used. More than 100 kilograms of scrap welding rods had been dipped in his welding flux. The grain, oil, and cigarettes used at home were all purchased on credit from the cooperative, and were deducted entirely from his wages after they were paid. After receiving his salary in May, he only had 5,000 yuan left. His family was so poor that they couldn't even afford vegetables. The children had almost developed a habit of not eating vegetables, and in the evening they had to help their mother hold the welding rods for their father until they were dry (because there was no support, the soft steel rods needed to be held by someone to dry after being dipped in the flux).

Poverty did not stop Li Jinquan's efforts; however, the cynicism of backward elements almost made him smash all the medicine bottles. When the news of his trial production of welding flux spread, some workers encouraged him, but some people said behind his back: "If rabbits could pull carts, why would we buy mules and horses!" Some workers who used to be very close to him also didn't pay much attention to him anymore. Someone criticized him at the trade union group meeting for "seeking personal credit." The phenomenon of disunity became more and more obvious. The Party, government, and trade union of the forging and welding workshop convened all the electric welders and held a criticism meeting. At the meeting, Li Jinquan stated that he would never be conservative and welcomed everyone to study together after work. However, no one went to him after the meeting.

	The responsible personnel of the forging and welding workshop did not provide enough help and encouragement, but he did not lose heart.

It was a great thing for the factory that Li Jinquan spent his own money to research welding flux in order to utilize scrap welding rods; however, the administrative side of the forging and welding workshop did not provide enough help and encouragement to him. Last winter, he used his self-made welding rods to weld the air bag for the locomotive and did a cold pump test. He asked the director and engineer of the forging and welding workshop to go and see. However, the director made excuses not to go three times. The factory did not have cast iron welding rods. After Li Jinquan successfully experimented with wrought iron welding rods, he wanted to try making cast iron welding rods. He asked the director for a pound of scrap welding rods to dip in the flux. However, the director evaded him repeatedly and didn't give it to him even after he asked twice. He did not promptly go to the factory director to help him solve the problem. Later, Li Jinquan saw the story of the engineer and worker Gao Jingshui jointly making electric welding rods in the "Worker Labor Inventions and Creations" published in the Northeast. He found Li Shengchao (worker), a member of the management committee of the machine repair factory. After Li Shengchao negotiated with the director of the machine repair factory, he asked Li Jinquan to collect the scrap welding rods. The director of the forging and welding workshop also repeatedly tested Li Jinquan's welding rods, but his requirements were too harsh, and he did not encourage and help him properly. Since last winter, Li Jinquan had been using self-made welding rods when working. Since January of this year, other workers have also been using the welding rods he made. In early April, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry approved his welding rods as qualified for use. Until recently, the reward committee of the steel plant decided to reimburse him for all the medicine expenses for the experiment and give him a bonus.

	He is a Communist Party member, and his class consciousness enabled him to overcome the difficulties in the experiment.

The trade union did not pay much attention to Li Jinquan's research on welding flux. Although the Party branch had talked to him, it did not provide much concrete help. What kind of force encouraged Li Jinquan and enabled him to overcome all the obstacles on the road ahead? Just look at his history and you will know.

Li Jinquan is thirty-six years old this year. He was born in Shenyang. His father was a worker in the Northeast Railway Factory. He himself worked as an electric welder in the railway factory from the age of fourteen. Ten years later, he transferred to the vehicle factory. Ten years later, in 1948, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the vehicle factory was disbanded and ordered to evacuate. He heard that it was easy to find work in Beijing and Tianjin, so he took his family to Tianjin. But at that time, there were more factories closed than open in Tianjin, and a large number of workers were unemployed. They wandered in Tianjin for several months, selling everything they could, and finally found a job as a stevedore at the dock, enduring beatings and scolding. At the end of June 1948, he got a chance to enter the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. At that time, the salary was pitifully low, and prices changed several times a day. The whole family lived on elm leaf cornmeal porridge. Half a year later, Shijingshan was liberated, the workers were emancipated, and the actual wages were guaranteed. Two children entered school. Last August, his right eye became ill, and the factory sent him to a hospital in the city for treatment. He was cured without spending a penny. He thought: Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can this happen. Under the Kuomintang, even if both your eyes were blind, who would care! Now that I have the ability, what am I waiting for? Last September, he saw a lot of scrap welding rods piled up in the warehouse, exposed to wind and rain, and the welding flux was gone. He felt heartbroken when he saw it, so he decided to make his own welding flux. He bought some medicine and went home to experiment after receiving his salary. Repairman and Communist Party member Li Shuanglin saw it and enthusiastically encouraged him to continue his research and reported the matter to the branch and the trade union. Li Jinquan experimented several times, and it was not bad. He was confident and continued to do it. He said: "Now we have everything, much better than before. As long as the factory is good, that's all." Whenever he heard strange words or was hit and got angry and wanted to quit, after a few workers and his wife persuaded him: "Are you getting angry with them, or with the factory!" He thought of the large number of scrap welding rods piled up in the factory, so he continued to do it. In February of this year, he gloriously joined the Communist Party, which gave him unlimited encouragement. Now, he is preparing to spend more money to make better quality welding rods, and then study some other welding fluxes. His purpose is only to save the factory more money and increase the country's wealth.

　　李金泉——一个不屈不挠的先进生产者
    卢念高
    李金泉是石景山钢铁厂的电焊工人，试做电焊条成功了。电焊条的质量虽比外买的稍差，但成本却减低了一半以上。外买的要两万三千四百元一公斤，他做的只合一万零五百元一公斤。库存的三吨零三百五十公斤废焊条，每公斤只需要加一千零五百元的焊药，就可以使用了。只利用废焊条这一项，就给国家节省了两万八千斤小米。如果按该厂每年用六吨多焊条计算，节省的钱就更多了。
    李金泉自做焊条的难能可贵，并不仅在于给国家节省了几万斤小米，更重要的是为了研究而经历了长期不断的斗争过程，这个过程很典型地说明了一个翻身后的先进生产者，对各种困难和阻碍是怎样克服的。
        自己花钱买化学药品，每天下班以后在家里进行试验。
    从去年九月起，他就打定主意研究焊药，并决心在研究成功以前，不让工厂花一个钱。他每次试验都是在下班以后。他家里没有茶碗，他就用了一大堆瓶子、罐子，装着三十多种化学药品。这些药品绝大部分是他自己花钱买的。他只向工厂里要过四瓶水玻璃，借过不到一磅的黄血盐。此外，还有可以算是公家的材料，就是用厂子里碎砖、碎瓦、碎玻璃，经他自己磨成的重灰、浸石棉、玻璃粉了。至于他自己买药花了多少钱，他没有计算过。不过花八万元买来的一磅氢氧化铝已经用光了，六千多元一磅的水玻璃已经用了十一磅。沾过他的焊药的废焊条已经在一百公斤以上了。他家里用的粮食、油、纸烟，都是向合作社赊的，发了工资一扣就光。五月份发薪后只剩了五千元。家里穷得连菜都不买。孩子们几乎养成了不吃菜的习惯，晚上还要和妈妈一起替爸爸提着焊条，直到凉干（因为没有支架，软钢条沾药后需要人提着凉干）。
    穷，并没有阻断李金泉的努力；可是落后分子的冷嘲热讽却几乎使他摔掉所有的药瓶子。当他试制焊药的消息传出后，有些工人鼓励他，但也有人在背后说：“兔子要能拉大车，还买大骡子大马干什么！”以前本来和他很亲热的工人，也有的不大搭理他了。工会小组会上有人批评他是“功劳主义”。不团结的现象越来越显著。锻焊厂的党、政、工，就召集全体电焊工，开了个检讨会。会上李金泉表明自己决不保守，下班后欢迎大家一起研究。但会后并没人去找他。
            锻焊厂的主管人员，帮助鼓励很不够，但他并不灰心。
    李金泉为了利用废焊条而自己花钱研究焊药，对工厂是极好的事；但是锻焊厂行政方面对他的帮助和鼓励是很不够的。去年冬天，他用自做的焊条，焊好机车用的风包，打冷泵做试验，请锻焊厂的主管兼工程师去看。但那位主管三次均托故未去。厂子里没有生铁焊条，李金泉试验熟铁焊条成功后，又想试做生铁焊条。他找主管要一斤废焊条去沾药。主管却一味敷衍，要了两次都没给。并未及时去找厂长帮他解决。后来李金泉看到东北出版的“工人劳动发明创造”上面，有工程师和工人高景水合做电焊条的故事。他就找到机修厂管委会委员李盛超（工人），李盛超找了机修厂长交涉以后，才叫李金泉领出废焊条。锻焊厂主管也曾屡次试验李金泉的焊条，但要求过苛，又不好好鼓励和帮助他。从去年冬天起，李金泉做活时已经使用自做的焊条。从今年一月起，别的工人也在使用他做的焊条。四月初，重工业部钢铁工业局批准了他的焊条合格可用。直到最近，钢铁厂的奖励委员会才决定补还他做试验用的一切药费，并给他一笔奖金。
            他是一个共产党员，阶级觉悟使他战胜试验中的困难。
    工会对李金泉研究焊药这件事，并没有怎么注意。党的支部虽然和他谈过话，但具体帮助也不多。究竟是甚么力量鼓舞着李金泉，使他战胜前进路上的一切阻碍呢？翻一翻他的历史就知道了。
    李金泉今年三十六岁，出生沈阳，父亲是东北铁路工厂工人，自己十四岁起就在铁路工厂作电焊工。十年后转到车辆工厂去。又过了十年，到一九四八年，在国民党反动统治之下，车辆工厂竟散了摊子，奉令疏散。他听说在京、津好找工作，就带着家眷到了天津。但那时天津的工厂也是关着的比开着的多，大批工人失业。他们在天津流浪了好几个月，当干卖尽，好容易才找到码头上当一名装卸工人，挨打挨骂地过了一些日子。在一九四八年六月底，他得到一个机会进了石景山钢铁厂。当时工资少得可怜，物价又一天几变，全家喝榆树叶棒子面粥度日。半年后，石景山解放了，工人翻了身，实际工资有了保证。两个孩子入了学校。去年八月，他右眼闹病，厂方把他送到市内医院来治，自己一个钱没花就治好了。他想：只有共产党领导才有这种事，在国民党时，你两只眼都瞎了，有谁来管啊！这回有本领不使还等甚么？去年九月，他看见仓库里堆了很多废焊条，风吹雨打，焊药都没了。他看着心痛，就起意自做焊药。发了薪就买些药回家试验。修理工、共产党员李双林看见了，热情地鼓励他研究下去，并向支部和工会反映这件事。李金泉试验了几次，还不错。他有了把握，就接着做下去了。他说：“现在甚么都有了，比以前强的多了。只要工厂好就行了。”每逢听到怪话，受到打击，发起脾气想不干时，经几个工人和他的老婆一劝：“你这是和他们呕气，还是和工厂呕气呀！”他想到工厂里堆着大批废焊条，就又接着干下去了。今年二月，他光荣地参加了共产党，更给了他无限的鼓励。现在，他准备多花些钱，做些质量更好的焊条，然后再研究些别的焊药。他的目的只是给工厂多省些钱，给国家增加些财富。
