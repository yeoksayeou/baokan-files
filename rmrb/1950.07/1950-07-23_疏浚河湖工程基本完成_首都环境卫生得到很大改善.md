[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The river and lake dredging project in Beijing, thanks to the correct leadership of the Municipal People's Government, the assistance of Soviet experts, and the efforts of the vast number of workers and troops stationed in Beijing, has now been basically completed. A total of 96 percent of the annual river dredging plan was completed, with over 1,199,000 cubic meters of earth removed, greatly improving Beijing's environmental sanitation.

The rivers and lakes in this city originate from Yuquan Mountain in the western suburbs and flow into the urban and suburban areas via the Jinchang River. One part flows along the northwest moat from Tie Ling Barrier west of Deshengmen into the city and pours into Jishuitan, Shichahai, and the Three Seas; the other part runs along the outer city wall and the former royal city as a moat. Finally, it converges with the Tonghui River outside Dongbianmen and enters the Bei Canal, forming a very complete river and lake system, which plays a significant role in regulating Beijing's climate and improving environmental sanitation. However, due to the long-term rule of the reactionary government in the past, most of the river channels were silted up, losing their original drainage function, and the Three Seas and Shichahai were turned into large stagnant pools; in summer, mosquitoes and flies bred, becoming the main source of epidemic infectious diseases, directly endangering the health of the people of Beijing. In order to improve environmental sanitation and protect the health of the people of Beijing, the Beijing Municipal People's Government merged and expanded the Environmental Sanitation Section of the former Health Bureau and the River and Canal Section of the Construction Bureau in January this year to establish the Hygiene Engineering Bureau. It also accepted the suggestion of Soviet municipal construction experts to dredge the original rivers and lakes and formulated the annual river and lake dredging plan. In order to complete this series of projects before the rainy season, construction began on February 12 (before thawing) from the downstream. Within 138 days, the Tonghui River, West Moat, Front Three Gate Moat, Jinchang River, Northwest Moat, Northeast Moat, South Moat, Tongzi River, Three Seas, and Shichahai (originally not included in this year's plan) were dredged successively, with a total of 1,199,492 cubic meters of earth removed, and 59,762 meters of river channels dredged, completing 96 percent of the annual river channel dredging plan. Ten machine wells were also dug along the Jinchang River to supplement the insufficient water supply from Yuquan Mountain during the dry season in June. The Construction Bureau also planted more than 50,000 trees along the Jinchang River and the eastern section of the Front Three Gate Moat this spring. After these projects are completed, the sewage from more than 170 sewers inside and outside the city that flows into the Front Three Gate Moat can be regularly flushed by the clean water from the West Moat; the spring water from Yuquan Mountain can flow into the city from the Jinchang River in a shorter route, supplementing the consumption of river water evaporation in summer. The dredging projects of Shichahai, Jishuitan, and other four seas, as well as the gate dam projects in Yuquan Mountain, Qinglong Barrier, Songlin Barrier, and Xibianmen are now being rushed. The dredging project of the Yuquan Mountain spring pool and the Jade Belt River will be continued after the rainy season.

During the construction, the Hygiene Engineering Bureau first adopted the method of reducing the number of personnel in the bureau and strengthening the construction organization. It mobilized the personnel in charge of construction to repeatedly study and discuss the construction plan and how to combine with the workers in the work. It also relied on district offices and relevant agencies to seize the time to mobilize farmers, troops, and unemployed citizens to participate in the work by means of work-for-relief. In addition, the direct operation piece-rate wage system was adopted, which eliminated the shortcomings of rough construction quality by contractors and the intermediate exploitation of workers by contractor foremen, and improved the work efficiency of workers. Thanks to these appropriate measures, the main projects of the original plan were successfully completed on schedule.

　　疏浚河湖工程基本完成
    首都环境卫生得到很大改善
    【京市新闻处讯】京市河、湖疏浚工程，由于市人民政府的正确领导、苏联专家的帮助及广大工人、驻京部队的努力，现已基本完成。计完成全年疏浚河道计划长度的百分之九十六，出土一百一十九万九千余公方，使北京的环境卫生得到很大改善。
    本市河、湖发源于西郊玉泉山，经金长河流入城郊。一部沿西北护城河自德胜门迤西铁棂闸入城注入积水潭、什刹海及三海；一部沿外城城墙及前王城而为护城河。最后于东便门外通惠河会合入北运河，成为一个很完善的河、湖系统，对调剂北京气候及改善环境卫生起着很大作用。但由于过去反动政府长期统治的结果，河道大多淤塞，失掉原有的宣泄作用，三海及什刹海亦随之变为大的死水坑；夏季蚊虫繁殖，成为流行性传染病的主要发源地，直接危害京市人民的健康。京市人民政府为了改善环境卫生保护京市人民健康，于今年一月将前卫生局的环境卫生科及建设局的河渠股合并、扩充设立卫生工程局，并接受苏联市政建设专家疏通原有河、湖的建议，制定了本年度的河、湖疏浚计划。为争取在雨季前完成这一系列工程，二月十二日起（未解冻）即自下游开始施工，在一百三十八天内，先后疏浚了通惠河、西护城河、前三门护城河、金长河、西北护城河、东北护城河、南护城河、筒子河、三海及什刹海（原未列入本年计划之内）等，共计出土一百一十九万九千四百九十二公方，疏浚河道长五万九千七百六十二公尺，完成全年疏浚河道长度计划的百分之九十六。并在金长河沿岸凿机井十眼，补助六月枯水期玉泉山供水的不足。建设局并于今春沿金长河及前三门护城河东段植树五万余株。这些工程完成后，内外城一百七十多条下水道注入前三门护城河的污水，可以经常得到西护城河净水的冲刷；玉泉山泉水可自金长河较短路程流入城内，补充夏季河水蒸发的消耗。什刹海、积水潭等四海疏浚工程及玉泉山、青龙闸、松林闸、西便门等处闸坝工程现正赶修中。玉泉山泉池及玉带河疏浚工程俟雨季后即可继续施工。
    在施工当中，卫生工程局首先采取了减少局内人员、加强施工组织的办法。动员负责施工人员反复地学习讨论施工计划及工作中如何与工人结合等问题。并依靠区公所和有关机关抓紧时间用以工代赈方式动员农民、部队及失业市民参加工作。另外采取直接经营计件工资制，消除了包工质量粗糙的缺点及包工工头对工人的中间剥削，提高了工人的工作效率。由于这些措施得当，使原计划的主要工程顺利如期完成了任务。
