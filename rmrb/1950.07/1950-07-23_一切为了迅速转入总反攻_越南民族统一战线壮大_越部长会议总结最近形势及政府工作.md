　　"Everything for a Swift Transition to a General Counter-Offensive"
    Vietnamese National United Front Strengthens
    Vietnamese Council of Ministers Summarizes Recent Situation and Government Work
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st] According to Vietnam News Agency (North Vietnam), the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam convened on the 15th, presided over by President Ho Chi Minh. The meeting summarized the recent situation and reviewed the government's work in diplomacy, politics, military affairs, and economics during the first half of this year. The Council of Ministers pointed out that the Vietnamese people are not only fighting against the French colonialists, but also resisting the American interventionists. The Vietnamese people are actively fulfilling the slogan "Everything for a Swift Transition to a General Counter-Offensive"; the National United Front is growing stronger day by day. The Vietnamese army and people's armed forces have broken through French defenses in many areas of South and Central Vietnam. The large-scale military operations by the French army in the Red River Delta area of North Vietnam are merely a defensive offensive. At the same time, the struggle against the French colonialists is also rapidly rising in Laos and Cambodia. Economically, the general mobilization of manpower and resources is proceeding smoothly. Rice and other harvests have greatly increased. In order to improve the people's living standards, rent reduction measures have been implemented. In addition, the people's administrative organs have been consolidated on the basis of democratic centralism. The judicial and educational systems have been reformed in accordance with the spirit of New Democracy.
    The meeting then discussed many important issues and made the following decisions: initiate a thrift campaign and issue public bonds, determine the labor law for workers in state-owned and private enterprises, implement a wage system based on labor, launch an agricultural cooperation movement, and require government employees to study for six hours per week.

　　“一切为了迅速转入总反攻”
    越南民族统一战线壮大
    越部长会议总结最近形势及政府工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南民主共和国部长会议于十五日在胡志明主席主持下召开。会议总结了最近时期的形势，并检讨了政府今年上半年在外交、政治、军事及经济诸方面的工作。部长会议指出：越南人民不仅对法国殖民者作战，而且也在反抗美国干涉者。越南人民正积极地履行着“一切为了迅速转入总反攻”这一口号；民族统一战线正日益壮大。越南军队和人民武装已在南越和中越的许多地区击破了法军防线。法军在北越红河三角地带的大规模军事行动，只不过是一种防御性的进攻。同时，反抗法国殖民者的斗争在老挝和柬埔寨也在迅速高涨。经济方面，人力和资源的总动员进行得很顺利。米谷等收获大增。为了提高人民生活标准，已经实行了减租措施。此外，人民的行政机构已在民主集中制的基础上巩固起来。司法和教育制度已根据新民主主义的精神加以革新。
    会议然后又讨论了很多重要问题，并作出了下列各项决定：发起节约运动和发行公债，确定国营和私营企业工人的劳动法，实行按劳取酬的工资制度，展开农业合作运动，政府工作人员每星期学习六小时。
