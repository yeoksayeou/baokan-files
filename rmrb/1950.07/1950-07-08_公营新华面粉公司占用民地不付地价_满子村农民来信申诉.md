　　Publicly Operated Xinhua Flour Company Occupies Civilian Land Without Paying Land Price: Petition Letter from Villagers of Manzi Village

Editor:

　　We have a problem that has remained unresolved for over two years, and we urgently hope you can help address it. The situation is as follows: In the winter of 1947, the publicly operated Xinhua Flour Company, managed by the Jizhong Administrative Office, moved from Hejian to our village (Manzi Village, Anping County, Hebei Province), occupying a total of 18.5 mu of our private land, as well as the buildings and trees on the surface (at that time, land reform had not yet been carried out in the village). We and the company had agreed that the price of the occupied land, buildings, and trees would be determined separately, giving us fair compensation. Later, the company gave us the money for the trees and buildings, but the land price for the 18.5 mu has been delayed. We have negotiated many times without any result. The company's intention is that the land portion should be resolved by the county government. However, land reform in our county ended in the spring of 1948, and there is no surplus land to distribute to us. As for the time of land reform, because our land had already been agreed upon to be compensated by the company, we had no reason to ask the village to allocate land to us again. For this matter, we wrote to the Hebei Daily asking for their help in resolving it, but we did not receive a reply. Last winter, we went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to ask for a resolution. The Ministry of Internal Affairs instructed the Hebei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to resolve it as soon as possible. When the Department of Civil Affairs sent someone to investigate, we proposed three solutions: (1) Sell the land to the company at a price; (2) We lease the land to the company; (3) The company compensates us with other land. However, the Department of Civil Affairs stated that this matter was related to the work of the Department of Finance and that the Department of Finance should propose specific measures. As a result, it was not resolved.

　　Later, Section Chief Song of the Anping County Government came to the village and convened a meeting with our fourteen families, persuading us to "abandon property rights, put the public before the private." Finally, he said that we were not allowed to jointly name and elect representatives to petition higher levels, otherwise it would be illegal. We don't know why the government's enterprise occupies our land without compensation? Why does Section Chief Song of the county government not allow us to petition higher levels? Please, editor, find a way to transfer our problem to the Hebei Provincial Government for a quick resolution.

　　Farmers of Manzi Village, Anping County, Hebei Province: Li Luoshu, Li Luoqiu, Li Luotu, Li Suozhu, Li Qiuxi, Li Zhengang, Ma Lingcai, Li Lole, Han Luomao, Han Luokai, Li Jingming, Li Yinhuai, Li Pinqing, Li Zaiqi.

　　Editor's Note: According to the situation reflected in the letter, the three solutions proposed by the farmers of Manzi Village are all reasonable and feasible. Section Chief Song of the Anping County Government is completely incorrect in saying that farmers should "abandon property rights, put the public before the private." It is even more wrong not to allow farmers to appeal to higher authorities. We hope that the Hebei Provincial People's Government will thoroughly investigate this matter and resolve it reasonably.

### 公营新华面粉公司占用民地不付地价  满子村农民来信申诉

　　公营新华面粉公司占用民地不付地价
    满子村农民来信申诉编者同志：
    我们有一个问题两年多没有解决，迫切地希望你们帮助处理。事情是这样的：在一九四七年冬天，有冀中行政公署经营的新华面粉公司从河间迁到我村（河北安平县满子村），占用我们私人土地共十八亩五分，及地面上的房屋和树木（当时村里还没有进行土地改革）。我们和公司双方曾言明：占用的地皮，房屋及树木分别订出价格，给予我们公平的补偿。后来公司将树木及房屋的钱给了我们，但十八亩五分地的地价则一直拖延不发。我们多次交涉均无结果。公司的意图是：土地部分，应由县政府给我们解决。但是我县的土地改革在一九四八年春天已经结束，没有多余的土地可以分给我们了。至于在土地改革的时候，因为我们的土地已与公司言明折价补偿我们，所以当时无理由要求村中再分给我们土地。为此事我们曾写信给河北日报请他们帮助解决，没有得到答复。去年冬天，我们又到内务部要求解决，经内务部指示河北省民政厅从速给我们解决。民政厅派人调查时，我们曾提出三种处理意见：（一）土地作价卖给公司；（二）我们把土地租与公司；（三）公司用另外土地补偿我们。但民政厅以这事与财政厅的工作有关，应由财政厅提出具体办法，结果也未解决。
    后来，安平县府宋科长到村召集我们十四家开会，劝说我们“放弃产权，先公后私”。最后并说不准再联名及推选代表向上级请示，否则即为违法。我们不知道为什么政府的企业无代价的占据我们的土地？县府宋科长又为什么不允许我们向上级请示？请编辑同志设法将我们的问题转河北省政府迅速为我们解决。
    河北省安平县满子村农民李洛书、李洛丘、李洛土、李锁柱、李秋喜、李振刚、马玲彩、李洛乐、韩洛茂、韩洛楷、李景明、李印槐、李品卿、李再起。
    编者按：根据信上所反映的情况，满子村农民所提三种处理意见都是合理可行的。安平县政府的宋科长所说的要农民“放弃产权，先公后私”是完全不正确的。不准农民向上级申诉，更不应该。望河北省人民政府彻查此事，加以合理解决。
