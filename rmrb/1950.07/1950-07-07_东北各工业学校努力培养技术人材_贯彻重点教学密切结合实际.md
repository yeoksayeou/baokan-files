Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. In order to cultivate a large number of technical talents and meet the needs of economic construction, industrial schools in the Northeast region are implementing a policy of focusing on key teaching areas and integrating theory with practice.

In addition to Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenyang Institute of Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Anshan Industrial Specialized School, and Fushun Mining Specialized School, there are twelve industrial vocational schools run by the Northeast Industrial Department and various bureaus and companies, with more than 6,440 students. It is planned to add four more schools in the next semester. In addition to recruiting junior high school graduates, the schools will absorb workers with potential from various factories and mines.

Industrial vocational schools have adopted the policy of focusing on key teaching areas and integrating theory with practice in education. As early as August of last year, the Industrial Department formulated a unified teaching plan and syllabus based on this policy. This semester, in accordance with the actual needs of industrial construction, necessary departments and groups have been added. For example, the Civil Engineering Department, which was originally one department, is now divided into Civil Engineering and Architecture; the original Mining Department is divided into Coal Mining and Metal Mining; the Metallurgy Department is divided into Iron and Steel Metallurgy and Non-ferrous Metal Metallurgy; Iron and Steel Metallurgy is further divided into Steel and Iron groups; and a Mineral Processing group has been added to the Non-ferrous Metallurgy Department. The curriculum is increased or decreased according to the specific conditions of each department, without disrupting the scientific system. For example, the acoustics and optics parts of physics are of little use to current machinery and electrical engineering, so it has been decided not to teach them, but the entire course will be taught in the Architecture Department. Internships and experiments in each school are generally included in the curriculum plan. For example, the purpose of the Electrical Engineering Department's first-year internship is to increase general knowledge of electricity and simple working methods; the second year is to enable students to gain preliminary practical work experience before entering specialized studies; and the third year is to coordinate with specialized teaching content, so that students can unify theory and practice and truly master technology, so that they can take on certain practical work after graduation.

After many efforts, the teaching equipment of each school has also taken shape. For example, the internship factory of the Textile Senior Vocational School has 2,300 spindles, 30 looms, and a relatively complete laboratory. The machinery internship factory of Shenyang Industrial Senior Vocational School has dozens of important machines such as lathes, planers, and milling machines, and general internships and experiments can be carried out in the school. Since the school sites of many schools are located near major industrial and mining areas, students usually have many opportunities to visit and intern at factories and mines. For example, Fushun Mining Industry Specialized School interns at the mine for one week every six weeks. Shenyang Industrial Senior Vocational School concentrates on the problems that cannot be solved in school internships every month and visits relevant sites, which has been very effective. In order to further contact various factories and mines and improve the effectiveness of education, some schools have specially invited experts from relevant factories and mines to give lectures regularly, and invited relevant experts and professors to jointly revise and enrich the curriculum content.

In addition, the Industrial Department and various schools pay great attention to the research work of teachers. School teachers often combine teaching preparation and go to relevant factories and mines to conduct field research, so as to combine theory with practice and solve difficult problems in teaching.

　　东北各工业学校努力培养技术人材
    贯彻重点教学密切结合实际
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】为培养大批技术人材，适应经济建设的需要，东北地区的工业学校贯彻重点教学和理论与实际结合的方针。
    东北全区除哈尔滨工业大学、沈阳工学院、大连大学工学院、鞍山工业专门学校、抚顺矿山专门学校外，东北工业部及各局、公司所办的工科职业学校共有十二所，学生六千四百四十余人，并准备在下学期中增办四所。各学校除招收初中毕业生外，将吸收各厂矿中有培养前途的工人入学。
    工科职业学校在教育上均采取了重点教学和理论与实际结合的方针。早于去年八月间，工业部即根据此一方针统一拟定了教学计划和课程纲要，在本学期首先按照工业建设的实际需要，增设了必要的科、组，如土木建筑科原为一科，现分为土木、建筑两科；原来的采矿科分为采煤、金属采矿两科；冶金科分为钢铁冶金及有色金属冶金两科；钢铁冶金更分为钢组及铁组；有色冶金科增设了选矿组。课程根据各科情况，在不打乱科学系统的原则下，加以增减。如物理学中的音学、光学部分对目前的机械、电机用处较小，便决定不教，在建筑科便全部讲授。各学校的实习与实验一般都列入课程计划之内。如电机科第一学年的实习目的为增加一般电力方面的知识和简单的工作方法；第二学年则为使学生进入专科前获得初步的实际工作经验；第三学年为配合专科教学内容，使学生理论与实践统一，以确实掌握技术，以便在毕业后即能担任一定的实际工作。
    经过多次的努力，各学校的教学设备亦已粗具规模。如纺织高级职业学校的实习工厂，有二千三百枚纱锭、三十台织布机及较完整的化验室等。沈阳工科高级职业学校的机械实习工厂有车床、刨床、铣床等重要机器数十台，一般实习、实验均可在校内进行。由于许多学校的校址设在临近各大工矿区，学生平时亦有很多机会可到厂矿参观与实习。如抚顺矿山工业专门学校每隔六个星期到矿山实习一个星期。沈阳工科高级职业学校将在学校实习中不能解决的问题，每月集中起来到有关现场参观，收效很大。为了进一步与各厂、矿取得联系，提高教育的实效，现部分学校特请有关各厂矿的专家定期讲学，并请有关专家与教授共同修订和充实课程内容。
    此外，工业部及各学校对教师的研究工作甚为注意，学校教师经常结合教学准备，到有关厂、矿实地研究，以便使理论与实践结合，解决教学中的困难问题。
