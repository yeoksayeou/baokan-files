Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Preventing and Controlling Cotton Pests and Ensuring a Bumper Cotton Harvest" on the 15th of this month. The instructions point out: Although the national cotton planting task has been overfulfilled, some cotton fields in various places have recently been severely damaged by pests such as aphids and red spiders. To ensure a bumper cotton harvest, in addition to strengthening cotton field cultivation, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize and organize farmers to launch a struggle against various insect pests. To this end, the instructions specifically stipulate:

(1) Governments at all levels must regard the prevention and control of cotton pests as an extremely important task at present. They should mobilize all forces and use the experience of organizing locust eradication and cutworm control in the past to organize the masses to launch a movement to prevent and control cotton pests, minimizing insect damage. July and August are the busy farming season, and pest control work in various places should be combined with summer planting, weeding, and flood prevention.

(2) In areas currently affected by cotton aphids and red spiders, and in areas affected by cutworms and leaf rollers in summer and autumn, all simple and easy-to-implement methods commonly used by the masses (such as using tobacco water to control aphids) should be rapidly and widely promoted through various meetings, training courses, etc., and the role of all existing insecticides and machinery should be maximized.

(3) Conduct timely and multiple cultivations, weeding, irrigation, and drainage. Where conditions permit, strive for one topdressing application of fertilizer. This will not only make the cotton seedlings grow strong, increasing yield, but also relatively reduce the harm of aphids to cotton.

(4) All agricultural experiment stations, state-owned farms, and seed farms, in addition to guiding the masses in pest control, should meticulously prevent and control the cotton propagated by their respective farms. They must do better than the masses to play a leading and exemplary role.

　　农业部指示各地组织农民防治棉虫
    结合加强耕作保证棉产丰收
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府农业部于本月十五日发出《防治棉虫，保证棉产丰收的指示》。指示指出：全国棉田播种任务虽已超额完成，但因最近各地部分棉田发生蚜虫、红蜘蛛等为害甚大，为保证棉花丰收，各地除加强棉田耕作外，必须大力发动和组织农民向各种虫害展开斗争。为此，指示具体规定：
    （一）各级政府必须把防治棉花虫害，看作是当前一项极重要的工作，应动员一切力量，用过去组织捕蝗和打黏虫的经验，组织群众展开防治棉虫的运动，使虫害减少到最低限度。七、八月份正值农忙季节，各地治虫工作应和夏播、锄苗、防汛等工作结合进行。
    （二）目前在棉蚜、红蜘蛛为害的地区和夏秋间在金钢钻、卷叶虫为害的地区，应将一切群众习惯采用的简单易行的办法（如烟草水治蚜），通过各种会议、训练班等方式，迅速普遍推广，并尽量发挥现有一切杀虫药械的作用。
    （三）进行适时的多次的中耕、除草、灌溉、排水，有条件的地区并争取上追肥一次，这样既能使棉苗生长健旺，以增加产量，又可相对地减少蚜虫对棉花的危害。
    （四）各农事试验场、国营农场、繁种场，除须指导群众防治虫害外，各该场繁殖的棉花更应周密防治，必须比群众做的好，这样才能起带头和示范的作用。
