　　Letter to Soviet Writers
    Stalin
    Editor's Note: Issues 51 and 52 of this journal published the translations of Stalin's letters to Bill-Belotserkovsky and Gorky, which were first printed in Volumes 11 and 12 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House. Now we continue to translate his letters to two other Soviet writers. These letters are documents of great significance in the construction of Marxist-Leninist literary theory. In his letters to Felix Kohn and Bessemenn, Comrade Stalin not only showed such warm concern and love for the new forces of literature, but also indicated an important principle of literary criticism, which is to make a comprehensive evaluation of literary works. Therefore, when criticizing a work that is good in its basic orientation, its positive significance should be affirmed first, and one should not nitpick on individual, unimportant details.
    To Comrade Felix Kohn
    Copy to Comrade Kolotilov, Secretary of the Central Bureau of Ivanovo-Voznesensk Province:
    Comrade Kohn:
    Comrade Russova's short review of Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet ("Mass Competition") has been received. My opinion on this matter is as follows:
    (1) Comrade Russova's review gives an overly one-sided and unfair impression. Let me assume that there is no Balkina textile machine in the world, and that there is no textile factory in Zaryazhye. Let me also assume that the Zaryazhye factory is being "rectified every week." It can be admitted that Comrade Mikulina may have been misled by some storyteller and made some major mistakes, which is certainly bad and unforgivable. But is that the point? Is the value of this pamphlet determined by individual details rather than by its overall tendency? Comrade Sholokhov, a famous contemporary writer, made some extremely serious mistakes in his "Quiet Flows the Don," and made some simply incorrect reports about Shchors, Podtelkov, Krivoshlykov, and others, but does this lead to the conclusion that "Quiet Flows the Don" is of no use at all and should be banned?
    Where does the value of Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet lie? It lies in popularizing the idea of competition and infecting the reader with the spirit of competition. That's the point, not some individual mistakes.
    (2) Perhaps because of the preface I wrote for Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet, the critics expected too much and something extraordinary from this pamphlet, and now, after being disillusioned with their expectations, they decided to punish the author of this pamphlet. However, this is incorrect and unfair. Of course, Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet is not a scientific work. Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet is a story about the cause of mass competition and the actual situation of competition. That's all. If my preface gave an excessively high evaluation to her essentially ordinary pamphlet, then the fault does not lie with Comrade Mikulina. One cannot punish the author of this pamphlet and the readers of this pamphlet by banning its sale. Banning sales should only be used for works with non-Soviet tendencies, for anti-Party and anti-proletarian works. There is nothing anti-Party or non-Soviet in Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet.
    (3) Comrade Russova is particularly indignant that Comrade Mikulina "misled Comrade Stalin." One cannot but cherish Comrade Russova's concern for Comrade Stalin here. However, it, this concern, in my opinion, is not caused by necessity.
    First, "misleading Comrade Stalin" is not so easy.
    Second, I do not regret writing a preface for a humble pamphlet by an unknown person in the literary world, because I believe that Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet, although with its individual and perhaps major mistakes, will bring great benefits to the working class.
    Third, I firmly oppose writing prefaces only for pamphlets and books by literary "aristocrats," literary "celebrities," "masters," etc. I believe that now we should abandon the aristocratic habit of promoting the literary "celebrities" who have already been promoted, whose "greatness" keeps our young, unknown, and forgotten literary forces in constant groaning.
    We have hundreds and thousands of capable people who are doing their best to rush from the bottom to the top in order to contribute a little something to the general treasure of our construction work. However, their efforts are always in vain, because what often suppresses them is the arrogance of literary "celebrities," the bureaucracy and coldness of some of our organs, and the envy of their peers (which has not yet turned into competition). One of our tasks is to break this copper wall and iron wall and give way to countless young forces. My preface to the humble pamphlet by an ordinary and unknown author in the literary world is an attempt to take a step towards solving this task. In the future, I will only write prefaces for ordinary, unpretentious pamphlets by ordinary, unknown authors among the young forces. Perhaps all those who worship status will be unhappy with this approach. But what does this have to do with me? I generally dislike people who worship status.
    (4) I think the comrades in Ivanovo-Voznesensk should call Comrade Mikulina back to Ivanovo-Voznesensk and "pull her ears" for the mistakes she made. I certainly do not object to scolding her well in the publication for Comrade Mikulina's mistakes. But I firmly oppose pushing this absolutely capable female writer into the abyss and burying her.
    As for banning the sale of Comrade Mikulina's pamphlet, this barbaric idea should not be "heeded" in my opinion.
    With communist greetings

    To Comrade Bessemenn
    Comrade Bessemenn (Note 1):
    This letter is late.
    I am not a literary expert, of course, nor a critic. However, due to your firm request, I have no choice but to tell you my personal opinion.
    I have read both "Shooting" (Note 2) and "The Days We Live In." There is nothing "petty-bourgeois" or "anti-Party" in these works. These two works, especially "Shooting," can be regarded as examples of current proletarian revolutionary art.
    Indeed, they have some remnants of Komsomol adventurism. Inexperienced readers may even feel when reading these works that it is not the Party that is correcting the mistakes of the youth, but the opposite. However, it is not this shortcoming that constitutes the basic characteristics and touching aspects of these two works. Their touching aspects lie in emphasizing the shortcomings of our organs and firmly believing that it is possible to correct these shortcomings. Whether it is "Shooting" or "The Days We Live In," their main thing is here. Their basic value is here. But this value greatly outweighs and deeply drowns out their small, and in my opinion, passing shortcomings.
    With communist greetings
    J. Stalin
    March 19, 1930

### 给苏维埃文学家的信

专栏：

　　给苏维埃文学家的信
    斯大林
    编者按：本刊第五十一、五十二期登载了第一次刊印于苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版的《斯大林全集》第十一、十二卷中的斯大林给比尔——别洛采尔科夫斯基和高尔基的信的译文。现在继续译载他给另外两位苏维埃文学家的信。这些信是在马列主义文艺理论的建设上具有重大意义的文献。在给费里克斯·康和别塞勉斯基的信中，斯大林同志不但对文学的新生力量表现了这样热烈的关心和爱护，并且指示了文学批评的一个重要原则，即是应当对文学作品作全面的估价。因此在批评一篇在基本倾向上是好的作品时，应首先肯定它的积极意义，而不应在个别的不重要的细节上吹毛求疵。
    给费里克斯·康同志
    给伊万诺伏——伏兹涅森斯克省中央局书记柯洛季洛夫同志的副本康同志：
    鲁索法同志对米库琳娜同志小册子（《群众竞赛》）的短评，已经收到了。在这件事情上我的意见如下：
    （一）鲁索法同志的评论产生了过于片面和不公平的印象。我且假定世界上没有巴尔基那纺织机，而且扎尔雅吉也没有纺织厂。我同时且假定扎尔雅吉工厂“每周都在整顿着”。可以承认：米库琳娜同志也许被某个讲故事的人引入了谬误，因而犯了一些重大的错误，这当然是不好的和不可原谅的。但是难道问题就在这里吗？难道这本小册子的价值是由个别的细节而不是由它的总的倾向来决定的吗？当代著名的作家萧洛霍夫同志在其《静静的顿河》中犯了一些极重大的错误，而且关于守尔卓夫、波特焦尔科夫、克利伏希雷科夫及其他等人，作了一些简直不正确的报道，但是难道由此可以得出结论说：《静静的顿河》是丝毫没有用处的东西，应该禁止销行吗？
    米库琳娜同志这本小册子的价值是在什么地方呢？是在于它把竞赛这个思想通俗化了，而且以竞赛的精神感染着读者。问题就在这里，而不在于某些个别的错误。
    （二）可能由于我给米库琳娜同志这本小册子所写的序言，批评家们就期望这本小册子过分多的和什么不寻常的东西，而且现在对自己的期望感到幻灭以后，他们就决定处罚这本小册子的作者。然而这是不正确的和不公道的。当然，米库琳娜同志的小册子不是科学著作。米库琳娜同志的小册子是关于群众竞赛事业、关于竞赛实际情况的故事。仅此而已。如果我的序言给她实质上很平常的小册子造成了过高的评价，那末罪过并不在于米库琳娜同志。不能因此以禁止销行来处罚这本小册子的作者和处罚这本小册子的读者。禁止销行只能用之于非苏维埃倾向的作品，用之于反党的、反无产阶级的作品。米库琳娜同志的小册子没有任何反党的和非苏维埃的东西。
    （三）鲁索法同志对于米库琳娜同志“把斯大林同志引入谬误”，特别感到愤慨。不能不珍视鲁索法同志在这里对斯大林同志所表示的关心。然而它、这个关心，在我看来并不是由于必要而引起的。
    第一，“把斯大林同志引入谬误”并不是如此地容易。
    第二，我毫不失悔我给文学界中无名的人的不足道的小册子写了一篇序言，因为我认为：米库琳娜同志的小册子，虽然有其个别的而且也许是重大的错误，却会给工人阶级带来很大的好处。
    第三，我坚决反对只给文学“贵族”、文学“名人”、“巨匠”等等的小册子和书写序言。我认为现在应当抛弃那把本来已经提拔起来了的文学“名人”加以提拔的贵族习惯，这些文学“名人”的“伟大”使我们年青的没有谁知道而且被大家所忘记的文学力量处于不断呻吟之中。
    我们这里有成百成千有能力的人，他们用尽力量要从下面冲到上面来，以便向我们建设工作的总的宝藏贡献自己的一点儿东西。然而他们的努力总是白费，因为压抑他们的往往是文学“名人”的自傲、我们某些机关的官僚主义和冷酷无情、同辈男女的羡妒心（它还没有转变成竞争）。我们的任务之一就在于打破这个铜墙铁壁，给不可胜数的年青力量以出路。我给文学界中无名的作者的不足道的小册子所写的序言，就是企图向解决这个任务方面迈进一步。我今后也只给年青力量中间普通无名的作者的普通不叫嚣的小册子写序言。可能凡是崇拜地位的人都不高兴这种方式。但是这与我有什么相干呢？我一般是不喜欢崇拜地位的人的。
    （四）我认为伊万诺伏——伏兹涅森斯克的同志们应该把米库琳娜同志唤回伊万诺伏——伏兹涅森斯克，为了她所犯的错误“扯她的耳朵”。我决不反对为了米库琳娜同志的错误在刊物上把她好好地责骂一顿。但是我坚决反对把这个绝对有能力的女作家推下深渊，埋葬起来。
    至于说到禁止销行米库琳娜同志的小册子，那末这个野蛮的思想在我看来是不应该加以“理睬”的。
    致共产主义的敬礼
    约·斯大林
    一九二九年七月九日
    给别塞勉斯基同志别塞勉斯基（注一）同志：
    这封信写得迟了。
    我不是文学专门家，当然也不是批评家。然而由于你的坚决要求，我只好把我个人的意思告诉你。
    我把《射击》（注二）和《我们生活的日子》都读过了。这些作品里并没有什么“小资产阶级的”东西，也没有什么“反党的”东西。这两部作品，特别是《射击》，可以算作目前无产阶级革命艺术的榜样。
    的确，它们有着共产主义青年团冒险主义的若干残余。没有经验的读者在读这些作品时甚至会觉得：不是党在改正青年的错误，而是相反。然而并非这个缺点构成着这两部作品的基本特点、感人之处。它们的感人之处是在于着重指出我们机关的缺点并且深信有改正这些缺点的可能。不论《射击》与《我们生活的日子》，它们主要的东西就都在这里。它们基本的价值就都在这里。可是这个价值大大地盖过了而且深深地淹没了它们的细小的，在我看来是正在过去的缺点。
    致共产主义的敬礼
