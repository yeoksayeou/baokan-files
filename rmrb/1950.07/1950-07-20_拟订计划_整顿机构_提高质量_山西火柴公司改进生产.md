　　Draft Plans, Rectify Institutions, Improve Quality
    Shanxi Match Company Improves Production
    [This newspaper Taiyuan dispatch] The Shanxi Provincial Match Company has, from July 1st, already been carrying out production in accordance with the tasks assigned and the standard specifications stipulated by the National Match Industry Conference. In order to improve quality, reduce costs, and overcome the difficulties of losses and sluggish sales, the company has drafted a work plan for the autumn. The content of this plan includes carrying out a rationalization proposal campaign, implementing a responsibility system, and establishing contact contracts between various workshops. With the high production enthusiasm of the workers, the company has made achievements in improving the uniformity of dipping match heads and increasing the number of matches packed per box.
    According to the production reduction plan, the company first rectified its institutions, needing to reduce personnel by about 39%. The retention or dismissal of employees will be decided through democratic discussion, based on work needs, technical level, work attitude, length of service, and other conditions. For those who are laid off, in addition to repeated education to clarify their thinking, all will be organized for training, with wages paid as usual.
    The second is the issue of changing specifications. Under the research and experiments of forestry engineers and others, the company's semi-finished products such as sticks and box materials are now manufactured according to the new specifications.
    The rationalization proposal campaign and the implementation of the responsibility system have also been vigorously launched. At the same time, the boxing department has put forward requirements to the dipping and stick unloading departments: they are required to dip the match heads evenly and unload them well. The workers in the dipping and stick unloading departments, in addition to accepting this requirement, also put forward to the boxing department: they are required to pack the number of matches according to the standard (note: small boxes should contain eighty matches). The inspection department, in order to cooperate with this campaign, has strengthened inspections and will publish the inspection results at any time to encourage everyone to improve efficiency and improve quality.

　　拟订计划  整顿机构  提高质量
    山西火柴公司改进生产
    【本报太原讯】山西省火柴公司从七月一日起，便已经遵照全国火柴工业会议所分配的任务和规定的标准规格，进行生产。该公司为了提高质量，降低成本，克服赔累滞销困难，已拟订了秋季工作计划。此项计划的内容，包括开展合理化建议运动，推行责任制，各工作间订立联系合同等项。在职工群众的高度生产热情下，该公司已作出蘸匀火柴头、装盒根数提高等成绩。
    根据减产计划，该公司首先整顿了机构，需要紧缩人员约百分之三十九左右，即将按照工作需要和技术水平、劳动态度、厂龄等条件，经民主讨论，决定职工的去留。对被裁减人员，除反复进行教育，打通其思想外，全部组织受训，工资照发。
    其次是改变规格问题。在林木工程师等研究试验下，现在该公司梗子、盒料等半成品已按照新规格制造。
    合理化建议运动及推行责任制也已热烈展开。同时装盒部已向蘸药、排卸梗等部提出要求：要他们将火柴头蘸匀，卸好。蘸药、排卸梗部的工友除接受了这项要求，并向装盒部提出：要求他们将根数装得合乎标准（按：小盒应为八十根）。检验部为了配合这一运动，更加强了检查，并将检查结果随时公布，以鼓励大家提高效率，提高质量。
