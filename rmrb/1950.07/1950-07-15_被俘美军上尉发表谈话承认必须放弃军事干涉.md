Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th: The first group of American prisoners of war was brought here on July 11th. One of the prisoners of war, a US Army 24th Division captain and battalion commander, said in response to questions from journalist representatives: I arrived in Busan on July 1st. I left Busan for Suwon, and I was captured in the first battle.

We have already seen how joyfully the residents of the liberated areas welcome the People's Army and have come to understand that we are fighting against the freedom of the Korean people. Now I also understand that American imperialists must abandon military intervention and must never infringe upon the freedom and independence of the Korean people.

　　被俘美军上尉发表谈话承认必须放弃军事干涉
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社平壤十三日讯：第一批美国战俘已于七月十一日被解到此间。战俘之一——美国第二十四师的一个上尉营长在回答记者代表的问题时说：我在七月一日到釜山。我离开釜山到水原，头一仗就成了俘虏。
    我们已经看到解放地区的居民是多么欢天喜地地欢迎人民军，并且已经了解我们是为反对朝鲜人民的自由而作战的。现在我也已经了解：美国帝国主义者必须放弃军事干涉，并且绝不可以侵犯朝鲜人民的自由与独立。
