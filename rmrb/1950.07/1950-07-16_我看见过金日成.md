　　“I Have Seen Kim Il-sung”
    Gong Tao
    "I have seen Kim Il-sung, Kim Il-sung educated me!" This voice keeps echoing in my ears. Today, this voice is even louder. This is what an old man told me, and every time I think of it, I remember his grateful and sincere eyes.
    It was March last year, and the ice had not yet thawed. After getting on the train from Shenyang, I rarely left the carriage. There were few people in the car, and the passengers were huddled in their seats, some lost in thought, some chatting idly, and occasionally there was the sound of snoring. My fingers were so cold that I couldn't even bother to flip through a book, and I hoped to find someone to talk to. Fortunately, an old man of nearly sixty, sitting next to me, was also looking around, so I started to pay attention to him. The old man's face was covered with deep wrinkles, but his not-too-sparse beard and big eyes gave him a heroic air. Undoubtedly, this was a simple old man with a strong sense of justice. As I was watching him, I happened to meet his kind eyes. He seemed to be sizing me up carefully, and after a while, he smiled at me, so I simply moved closer to him and started talking:
    "Old man, where are you going?"
    "I'm going to Linjiang. I'll get off at Linjiang and go home. Comrade, what about you?"
    "I'm going to Andong. Is your home near Linjiang?"
    "Our village is at the foot of Changbai Mountain. You young people know this place well! Our village is also very close to Korea."
    "Your home is so close to Korea, so can you speak Korean?"
    "I can speak a little. Our village is on the border with Korea, so it's very close. We often have trade exchanges, so we've learned to speak some!"
    "You often interact with Koreans. Are the Koreans you've seen good people?"
    "Koreans are very good people. Everyone is very hardworking. The Koreans I've seen are all good people, and it's because of their leader's good leadership! The Kim Il-sung I've seen is the best of the Koreans!"
    "What! You've seen Kim Il-sung?! What is he like? When did you see him?" The old man's eyes lit up, and a proud smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. Obviously, my surprise aroused his infinite joy.
    "I have seen Kim Il-sung, and Kim Il-sung educated me!" Then, the old man began to speak as if telling a story, but also with many emotions:
    "That was during the enemy puppet era. One winter, five Japanese devils and two traitors came to our village to search for grain. Our village, scattered at the foot of Changbai Mountain, had twelve households. When the devils came, they searched house by house. That winter was particularly cold, and most of the grain had not been buried properly, so it was about to be robbed by the devils. The adults and children in the village were all crying, and everyone asked the devils to leave a little to survive the winter. Sister-in-law Li grabbed her only bag of flour and refused to let go, and was whipped by the devils until she was covered in blood. I pleaded with a traitor: 'Please tell the Japanese Imperial Army to leave her this bag!' That lackey glared at me and even kicked me, saying fiercely: 'Get out of here!' No one dared to say a word. After the devils robbed the grain, they even wanted us to drive carts to transport it to the city for them!
    "The snow at the foot of Changbai Mountain had not yet melted. If the slope was a little higher, the carts were very difficult to climb. The devils wanted me to pull the cart in front, but they slowly followed behind, not helping to push. The ground was too slippery. Just as the cart was pulled up, it would slide back down to the bottom of the mountain with a breath. The northwest wind was howling, and my two feet were like two blocks of ice, so cold! It froze people's noses and heads. With great difficulty, I pulled the cart up the slope. Then I thought of everyone in the village. This winter is so cold, how are we all going to survive! Thinking about it, I pulled the cart around a bend. Just as I was about to go downhill, suddenly gunshots rang out!
    "'Stop! Don't move, surrender your guns!' I was startled. When I looked back, I saw that we were surrounded by Korean guerrillas. One by one, young and strong lads, their guns were aimed at the devils who were just about to climb the hill. The devils were so frightened that they shivered, their legs trembling as if they were about to kneel. They all obediently surrendered their guns. In this way, we were taken to the mountains together!
    "We stayed in the mountains overnight. Early the next morning, a child took me to see their officer. I followed the child, muttering in my heart: 'I don't know what they're going to do! Maybe they'll be shot, or detained, or at least get beaten up!' Soon, he took me to a young man. That young man had a round face, and he looked like a good person at first glance. He even smiled and asked me to sit down and talk to him. This put me at ease!
    "He asked me if the crops were good this year, and if I could read. I told him that I had studied for two years during the Republic of China era and knew a little. He then asked me: 'Do you know what year it is in the Republic of China this year?' I replied that I didn't know. In fact, I had long forgotten. Unexpectedly, this sentence hurt him, and what was even stranger was that his tears immediately rolled down. He said: 'You are Chinese, how can you forget your own country? I still remember that this year is the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, and the Northeast has been lost for twelve years! I am Kim Il-sung...'
    "'Kim Il-sung!' I exclaimed in surprise. I didn't expect him to be Kim Il-sung. He spoke Chinese so well! I had long heard that Kim Il-sung's guerrillas were very active, and the devils were very afraid of him. I didn't expect him to be active in our village, and that this capable Kim Il-sung was so young.
    "Then he said: 'Old fellow! Don't be surprised, although I am Korean, I also love China very much. Our two nations are like two brothers. We are both unwilling to be slaves of the Japanese devils, unwilling to be subjugated people. But why have you forgotten China? The Chinese nation is a nation that has always loved freedom and peace. It does not invade others and is a very lovable nation. Today, it has been invaded by the devils. Patriotic Chinese people should resist Japan and drive away the devils. We are fighting guerrillas here to attack our common enemy - the Japanese devils...' When he said this, I seemed to understand! I didn't expect him to be a Korean, and he loved China so much. I remembered his sad tears, and my heart ached. It turned out that Koreans and us are no different, just like two brothers!
    "Finally, he gave me back the returned grain and asked me to send it back to the village to distribute to the folks. He was so good!
    "He invited me to have breakfast and then sent someone to escort me down the mountain. Before leaving, he took my hand and said: 'Don't forget China, we must drive out the devils!' I was educated by him. When I returned to the village, I told everyone what he said, and everyone was very happy. Sister-in-law Li, lying in bed, also murmured: 'Kim Il-sung came to rescue us!' Many people were moved to tears. I said: 'Just shedding tears is not enough, we must mobilize to resist Japan!' From then on, everyone was united, arresting traitors, guarding against devils, and not giving the devils grain. Also because there was this guerrilla force, the devils dared not come to the countryside often!"
    The old man finished speaking in one breath, his wide eyes seeming to ask me: "Comrade, why do you say Kim Il-sung loves China so much, and loves the Chinese people so much?" But he himself smiled knowingly, and finally asked me this:
    "Comrade, we have been liberated, and Chairman Mao is giving us a good life. What about the Koreans? Is Kim Il-sung giving them a good life too?" I told him that the people of North Korea, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, were living a good life, but South Korea was ruled by the reactionary Syngman Rhee, and the people of South Korea were still living a life of slavery and suffering. But the old man said with great confidence: "The people of South Korea will not suffer for too long. Kim Il-sung will liberate them. Those people will be educated by Kim Il-sung and rise up to resist Syngman Rhee and drive him out!"
    Today, General Kim Il-sung is leading his educated young soldiers, thousands of peace-loving and freedom-loving people, and is bravely fighting the enemy, defeating the armies of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and attacking American imperialism - our common enemy. As news of victory pours in, I think the old man must know, and how happy he must be!

　　“我看见过金日成”
    公陶
    “我看见过金日成，金日成教育了我！”这声音一直萦绕着我。今天，这声音更响亮了。这是一个老大爷告诉我的话，每次当我想起这话时，便会记起他那感激而诚恳的眼光来。
    是去年的三月天，冰还没有解冻。我从沈阳上火车后，就很少离开过车厢。车里人很少，客人都蜷伏在厢位上，有的沉思，有的闲聊，偶而也传来打鼾的声音。我的手指冻得连书都懒得翻了，希望能找到一个人一起谈谈，刚好坐在我旁边的一个快六十岁的老大爷，也正在东张西望，我就开始注意他。老大爷的脸上已刻满深深的绉纹，但他那不太稀疏的胡须，和那大眼睛，看来却很有些英雄气概。无疑地，这是一个正义感很强的朴实的老人。当我正在注视着他时，恰好碰上了他那善良的眼光，他好像很仔细的在打量着我，一会儿他竟望着我笑了，于是，我索性便挨过去和他谈起来：
    “老大爷，您到那儿去呀？”
    “我到临江去，到临江下车后就回家，同志，你哩？”
    “我去安东。你家在临江附近吗？”
    “咱们村就在长白山脚下，你们年青人可清楚这地方哩！咱们村离朝鲜也很近。”
    “您家和朝鲜离得那么近，那么您会说朝鲜话吗？”
    “会说一点，咱们村就在朝鲜边境上，离得太近啦。我们经常有卖买往来，也就学着会说一些呐！”
    “您们经常和朝鲜人来往，您所看见的朝鲜人都好吗？”
    “朝鲜人可好呐，大家都很勤劳，我看见的朝鲜人可都好，也是他们的领袖领导得好呀！我看见的金日成就是朝鲜人里最好的一个！”
    “喂！您见过金日成？！他啥样？您几时见过他？”老大爷的眼睛发亮了，嘴角露出得意的微笑，显然，由于我的惊奇，激起了他无限愉快的心绪。
    “我看见过金日成，也是金日成教育了我！”接着，老大爷便像讲故事一般，但又像怀有许多感慨似的说起来了：
    “那是在敌伪时代，一年冬天，五个日本鬼子和两个汉奸到咱们村来搜粮食。咱们村零散地住在长白山脚下的有十二户人家，鬼子来了，就挨着家搜。那年冬天特别冷，粮食也多半没有埋藏好，眼看着就要给鬼子抢光啦。村里的大人小孩都哭哭啼啼的，大伙要求鬼子给留下一点过冬，李大嫂子拉着她那仅有的一袋面不肯放手，被鬼子用皮鞭抽打得满身血淋淋的。我向一个汉奸求情：‘你给日本皇军说说吧，就留下她这一袋吧！’那狗腿子瞪着眼睛，还踢了我一脚，凶恨恨的说：‘滚开去！’吓得谁也不敢吱声了，鬼子把粮食抢完，还要咱赶着大车给他们运到城里去！
    “长白山脚下的雪还没有化，坡子稍微高一点，车子就很难爬上去，鬼子要我到前面去拉车，他们却慢慢的跟在后面，也不帮着推一下。地太滑了，车子刚拉上去，一喘气又滑下山脚来。西北风呼拉呼拉地刮着，我的两只脚呵，就像两块冰，那个冷呀！把人冻得鼻酸头痛。好容易把车子拉上了坡，我又想起村里的大伙儿，今年冬天这样冷，这要咱大伙怎么个过法呀！寻思着，我把车子已拉着转过一个弯，正要下坡时，突然枪声就响啦！
    “‘站住！不许动、缴枪！’我吓了一跳，回过头一望，四面都围满了朝鲜游击队。一个个年青力壮的小伙子，枪口都对准了刚要上山坡的那几个鬼子，鬼子吓得直哆嗦，腿脚抖动得要跪下去呐，都乖乖的缴了枪。这样，我们一起被带到山里去啦！，
    “在山里住了一夜，第二天一早，就有一个小孩带着我去见他们的长官。我跟着那孩子走，心里直嘀咕着：‘不知要作啥呐！也许是枪毙，或者拘押起来，至少也要挨一顿打！’不久，他便把我带到了一个年青人那儿。那个年青人呀，圆圆的脸，一看就是一付好人样，他还笑嘻嘻的要我坐下来和他谈呐，这我可放心啦！
    “他问我今年庄稼好不好？又问我识字吗？我告诉他，还是在民国年间念过两年书，识得一些。他又问我：‘你知道今年是民国几年了？’我回答他说不知道，实在的，我早就忘啦，想不到这句话却刺伤了他，更奇怪的是他的眼泪，马上滚了出来。他说：‘你是中国人，咋能把自己国家都忘了呢？我还记得中国今年是三十二年了，东北沦亡已经十二年啦！我是金日成……”
    “‘金日成！’我惊奇的叫出来啦。我想不到他就是金日成。他的中国话讲得可好哩！我早就听说过金日成的游击队活动得很厉害，鬼子很怕他，想不到他又活动到咱们村来了，而且这个能干的金日成还这样年青。
    “接着，他又说：‘老乡！别奇怪，我虽然是朝鲜人，但我也很爱中国，我们两大民族就像两兄弟样，我们都不甘心作日本鬼子的奴隶，不甘心作亡国奴，可是你为什么把中国忘记了呢？中华民族是一个素爱自由和平的民族，她不侵犯别人，是一个很可爱的民族，今天遭到了鬼子的侵略，爱国的中国人都应该抗日，打走鬼子，我们在这儿打游击，也就是为了打击我们共同的敌人——日本鬼子……’他这样一说，我好像明白啦！想不到他是一个朝鲜人，还这样爱中国，我想起他伤心的流眼泪，我心里直酸。原来他们朝鲜人也和咱们不分彼此的，就好像两兄弟一样！
    “最后他把退还的粮食给了我，要我送回村去分给老乡们。他真太好了！
    “他请我吃罢早饭，又派人送我下山，临走时他还拉着我的手说：‘别忘了中国，我们要把鬼子赶出去！’我受了他的教训，回到村里我把他的话告诉了大伙，大伙儿都挺高兴。李大嫂子躺在床上也嗯嗯的说：‘金日成来搭救咱们呐！’有好多人都感动得掉泪啦。我说：‘光掉泪不行，咱们要动员起来抗日！’从这以后，大伙儿都齐心啦，捉汉奸，提防鬼子，不给鬼子粮食，也因为有这支游击队在，鬼子也再不敢常下乡来啦！”
    老大爷一口气讲完了，他那睁大的眼睛似乎在询问着我：“同志，你说为啥金日成那样爱中国，那样爱中国的老百姓？”可是他自己又明白的笑了，他终于这样问我了：
    “同志，咱们倒得着解放啦，毛主席给咱们过好日子呐，你说，朝鲜人呢？金日成也给他们过好日子了吧？”我告诉他，北朝鲜的人民在金日成将军的领导下是过好日子了，可是南朝鲜却被反动派李承晚统治着，南朝鲜的人民还过着奴隶般地苦难的日子，但老大爷却很有自信地说：“南朝鲜人受苦不会太久的，金日成会解放他们的，那些人会受到金日成的教育，起来反抗李承晚，把他打出去的！”
    今天，金日成将军领导着他所教育的青年战士，千千万万爱好和平自由的人民，正在英勇地打击敌人，打败了李承晚傀儡政府的军队，打击着美帝国主义——我们共同的敌人。胜利的消息纷纷传来，我想，老大爷一定知道了，他该多么高兴呀！
