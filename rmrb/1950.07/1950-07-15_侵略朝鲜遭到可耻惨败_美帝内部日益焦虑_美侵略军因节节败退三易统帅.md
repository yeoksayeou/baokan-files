　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: The unexpected and disastrous defeat suffered by the US aggressor forces in Korea has aroused anxiety and frustration within the US ruling clique. According to a United Press Washington dispatch: Tydings, chairman of the US Senate Military Committee, declared after a secret meeting with Bradley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the 11th: "It is a great sin to take an optimistic view of the Korean situation." Another senator, who requested anonymity, said: "Bradley indicated that the Korean War may continue for months and months. Bradley did not completely deny the possibility of US forces being driven out of Korea."

　　Agence France-Presse Washington, 11th dispatch, stated: US Department of Defense personnel do not conceal their anxiety about the situation in Korea. They said in surprise: "The destructive effect of the US Air Force on North Korea's transportation, transport, and armored forces has not been able to obstruct the fierce offensive currently being launched by North Korea against US positions near Daejeon to any significant extent."

　　The New York Times also helplessly admitted on the 9th: "In military terms, we have been quickly—or rather, brutally—forced to learn a lesson. ... We have suffered losses, and undoubtedly will suffer more losses in the future." "We are not on a parade. The initial elation may have disappeared."

　　The US ruling clique, immersed in a pessimistic atmosphere, has begun to attack each other internally, seeking responsibility for the defeat. According to a United Press dispatch, Wisconsin Republican Senator Wiley vehemently criticized the US actions in the Korean War on the 9th as "a series of terrible failures and stupidities." He demanded that Secretary of Defense Johnson report to Congress on the "series of ridiculous mistakes" made in the Korean War. In his prepared statement, he said: "We simply cannot believe the assurances of our military that 'everything is going well,' because we know for a fact that everything is going very badly."

　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: Due to the repeated defeats in Korea, the US aggressors have replaced their commander three times. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch: MacArthur Headquarters announced on the 12th the appointment of Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army stationed in Japan, as commander of the US ground forces in Korea, replacing Major General Dean. Dean was appointed commander of the US Army invading South Korea on July 2nd, replacing his predecessor, Church.

　　侵略朝鲜遭到可耻惨败
    美帝内部日益焦虑
    美侵略军因节节败退三易统帅
    【新华社十四日讯】美国侵略军在朝鲜遭受到的意外惨败，已引起美国统治集团内部的焦虑和沮丧。据合众社华盛顿讯：美参院军事委员会主席泰丁斯，在十一日与美参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷举行秘密会议后宣称：“乐观的看待朝鲜事件是极大的罪恶”。另一要求不要披露姓名的参议员说：“布莱德雷提示朝鲜战争可能好几个月好几个月地继续下去。布莱德雷没有完全否定美军有被逐出朝鲜的可能。”
    法新社华盛顿十一日电称：美国国防部人员并不掩饰他们对朝鲜局势的焦虑，他们惊讶地说：“美国空军对北朝鲜的交通、运输与装甲部队所起的破坏作用，一直不能在任何相当大的程度上，阻挠北朝鲜目前正向大田附近的美军阵地发动猛烈的攻势。”
    纽约时报九日也无可奈何地承认：“在军事方面，我们已经迅速地——无宁说是残酷地——被迫领取了教训。……我们已经遭到失利，无疑地今后将遭到更多的失利。”“我们并不是在进行一种盛装游行。最初的兴高彩烈或许已经消逝。”
    浸入悲观气氛中的美国统治集团，其内部已开始互相攻击，追究战败的责任。据合众社讯，威斯康辛州共和党参议员维利于九日猛烈责难美国在朝鲜战争中的行动是“一连串可怕的失败及愚蠢”。他要求国防部长詹逊就朝鲜战争中所犯的“一连串可笑的错误”向国会报告。他在拟就的声明中说：“我们简直不能相信我们军部所说‘一切顺利’的保证，因为我们确知一切实在是非常不顺利的。”
    【新华社十四日讯】美国侵略者由于在朝鲜的节节败退，已三易其统帅。据合众社东京讯：麦克阿瑟总部于十二日宣布任命美驻日第八军军长瓦克为朝鲜美军地面部队司令官，以代替迪安少将。迪安系于七月二日被委任为侵入南朝鲜的美陆军总司令，以代替其前任者邱奇。
