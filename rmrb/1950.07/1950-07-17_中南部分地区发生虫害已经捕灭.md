　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th. This summer, over sixty counties in the Central and South China region experienced insect pest infestations on their crops. Through the vigorous efforts of the broad masses of farmers, the pests have been eliminated in many areas. Since the beginning of summer, various insect pests have occurred successively in parts of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangxi provinces, with rice borers and cotton aphids causing the most damage. For example, in Luchuan County, Guangxi Province, 160,000 mu of fields were affected by rice borers, nearly one-half of the county's total cultivated area. After the pest outbreak, local people's governments first conducted widespread pest control propaganda through farmer representative meetings, blackboards, and teachers and students in various primary schools, breaking down the superstitious beliefs of some farmers who regarded rice borers as "divine insects." Subsequently, pest control headquarters were established in many areas, with incentive measures such as rewarding one jin of rice for every jin of insects captured, and electing pest control models, actively leading farmers in pest control. The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central and South Military and Administrative Committee also provided over 6,000 sprayers and dusters, and 80,000 jin of insecticides on loan to farmers in areas affected by rice borers and cotton aphids, and sent technicians to assist farmers in pest control. Currently, the pest control campaign has been widely launched in various pest-affected areas. In Liling County, Hunan Province alone, 100,000 farmers are participating in rice borer elimination. To date, the county has captured over 17.8 million rice borers. Through the vigorous capture by the masses of farmers using various new and old pest control methods, the spread of insect pests has been stopped in many areas and is gradually being eliminated. For example, in Xiushui County, Jiangxi Province, ten districts were affected by insect pests. After the vigorous capture by 50,000 farmers, the seedlings in six districts have returned to their original state and can maintain normal yields. The more severely affected fields are also growing new leaves.

　　中南部分地区发生虫害已经捕灭
    【新华社汉口十五日电】中南区六十余县部分田禾于今夏遭受虫害，经广大农民大力捕捉，许多地区的虫害业已消灭。入夏以来，湖南、江西、湖北、广西四省部分地区相继发生各种虫害，其中以螟虫、棉蚜为害最大。如广西省陆川县有十六万亩田遭受螟害，几占该县总耕地面积的二分之一。当虫害发生后，各地人民政府即首先通过农民代表会议、黑板报以及各小学校师生广泛地进行除虫宣传，打破某些农民将螟虫看作“神虫”的迷信思想。继即在不少地区成立了除虫指挥部，规定捉虫一斤奖米一斤，以及选举捉虫模范等等奖励办法，积极领导农民除虫。中南军政委员会农林部又以喷雾器、喷粉器六千余具、杀虫剂八万斤等药械，贷发给各遭受螟虫，棉蚜地区的农民使用，并派技术人员前往协助农民除虫。现除虫运动已在各受虫害区域广泛展开。仅湖南省醴陵县即有十万农民参加除螟。到目前止，该县已捕获螟虫一千七百八十余万只。经过农民群众采用各种新、旧捕虫方法大力捕捉，不少地区的虫害已停止蔓延并渐趋消灭。如江西省修水县曾有十个区遭受虫害，经过五万农民大力捕捉后，现已有六个区的禾苗恢复原状，可以保持正常产量。其他受害较重的田禾也正在换生新叶。
