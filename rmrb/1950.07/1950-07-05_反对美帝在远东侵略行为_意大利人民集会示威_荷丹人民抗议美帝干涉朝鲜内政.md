Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: Combined TASS news reports: Major cities in Italy held mass protest rallies against the US imperialist acts of aggression in the Far East.

　　The grand protest rally of the Roman people was held on the 2nd, surrounded by a large number of motorcycle police. The police authorities had forbidden the distribution of notices announcing the assembly, but the masses who attended the rally still filled the Adriano Theater. Nenni, Chairman of the Italian Peace Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting, denouncing the US interference in Korea as an excuse for imperialist aggression against the Asian people. Nenni demanded that Italy withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, called on the people to expand the peace movement, and realize the demands of the Stockholm Declaration.

　　The working people of Turin held a one-and-a-half-hour general strike on the 1st to protest against US imperialist aggression against Korea. Large-scale protest rallies were also held in major factories. The people of Turin also held a protest demonstration in front of the US consulate.

　　Mass protest rallies were also held in Milan, Naples, and other major cities across the country.

　　In response to US imperialist aggression in Korea, Italy's peace signature campaign has been greatly strengthened. Milan has collected 750,000 signatures. Bologna collected 84,400 signatures in five days. In one day, Terni had 9,000 signatures, Perugia had 5,000, and Foggia had 15,000.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: Combined TASS news reports: The Dutch government has received many telegrams from working people protesting the Dutch authorities' compliance with US orders to send warships to Korea and demanding that the Netherlands withdraw from the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　On July 1, the Danish newspaper *Land and People* published two resolutions by port workers in Copenhagen, denouncing the US aggression in Korea. One resolution was addressed to the Danish government and parliament, and the second resolution was addressed to the US Embassy in Copenhagen. The first resolution stated: "We demand that the Danish government clearly denounce President Truman's attempt to drag the world into a new war. We demand that Denmark withdraw from the Atlantic Pact as soon as possible. We do not want to be cannon fodder for American capitalists. We want peace and improved social conditions."
