Aired on Central People's Broadcasting Station by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, on July 1st.

Fellow compatriots across the country!

Today, U.S. imperialism, which leads the aggressive bloc, is becoming increasingly arrogant. As everyone knows, MacArthur in Japan recently released a large number of Japanese war criminals, while purging, arresting, and imprisoning Japanese communists who are fighting for the liberation of the Japanese people. Everything is a reversal of justice, completely inheriting the mantle of Hideki Tojo.

Truman's challenging statement on June 27th was even more shameless and arrogant. The Korean people want to liberate Korea. Truman said that this was the Koreans "invading" Korea and ordered the U.S. Navy and Air Force to "protect" it. MacArthur then openly launched the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Taiwan is Chinese Taiwan, but the U.S.'s so-called Seventh Fleet is "performing legitimate and necessary duties in the area," and Truman openly "ordered the Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Taiwan." Is there such logic in the world besides from fascists?

U.S. imperialism has always been relatively good at deception, always treating democracy and freedom as exclusive American commodities. Some people who have been anesthetized always feel that the United States is democratic and free. Look at the hideous faces of the U.S. imperialist war-mongers today! What's yours is mine, and what's mine is still mine. This is American-style "democracy," and this is American-style "freedom!"

However, U.S. imperialists, tearing off their masks and revealing their hideous faces, do not show their strength, but rather their weakness. U.S. imperialism sees that its group of Oriental lackeys, Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Quirino, Shigeru Yoshida, and the like, are all weak and powerless in the face of the people, and are too useless, so they have to do it themselves. The fact that the leader of the bandits has to do it himself proves the decline of the bandit group.

Fellow compatriots across the country! The aggression of U.S. imperialism against China did not start today; we have long suffered enough. Especially around the time of Japan's surrender, U.S. imperialism fully supported the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique. How majestic it was at that time, almost Americanizing three-quarters of China. But what is it like today? Only Taiwan Island is left, chosen by Chiang Kai-shek as his tomb. The U.S. imperialists, who refuse to learn their lesson, are still unwilling to accept their fate and want to throw some funeral items into it, and want to be a second Japanese imperialism. Of course, that is also the freedom of war-mongers like Truman and MacArthur.

We Chinese people have a very clear understanding of the nature of imperialism, especially of the reality of U.S. imperialism.

Today, the development of imperialism has reached an irreparable dead end. Although U.S. imperialism gained a great advantage in the two world wars and made a great fortune, making it the most powerful imperialist country, it is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Since the end of World War II, especially in the last two or three years, production has been continuously declining, and the number of unemployed has been continuously increasing. Last October's production was 22 percent lower than the previous October. According to official statistics, there were 18 million unemployed at the end of last year. These figures show that U.S. imperialists are patients with stage three tuberculosis, which makes them impatient and feverish every day.

In contrast, there is the socialist country of the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union sacrificed the most in World War II, its post-war recovery was also the fastest. In 1949, the total national income exceeded that of 1940 before the war by 36 percent. Not only are there no unemployed in the Soviet Union, but the lives of workers and peasants have generally improved. In terms of living standards, workers' lives have improved by 24 percent and peasants' lives have improved by 30 percent.

Such a comparison illustrates the essential superiority of the individualistic capitalist system and the people-oriented socialist system. We Chinese people and all the kind people in the world who have not been deceived can see very clearly that for their own peace and happiness, everyone is willing to take the socialist road, everyone is willing to be led by the Communist Party, and everyone supports the Soviet Union's peaceful policies.

Despite the fact that U.S. imperialists are turning black and white upside down and clamoring against the Soviet Union and communism every day, all the people in the world who have not been deceived know that opposing the Soviet Union and communism is essentially opposing the people. The end of those who oppose the Soviet Union, oppose communism, and oppose the people has already been clearly demonstrated in history, not in the too distant history, but only in the reality of five or six years ago.

Fellow compatriots throughout China, U.S. imperialists have lost confidence in the peaceful competition. Of course, they also have eyes, seeing the increasing prosperity of the Soviet Union, the increasing strength of the peace camp, and their own increasing decline and the increasing desolation of the aggressive camp. They have to become increasingly restless and increasingly embark on the road to fascism. Despite the fact that the lessons of Hitler, Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo are not far away, they will not give up until they reach the Yellow River. The robbers are on their way, wanting to get to the execution ground sooner. Should we regret it for them?

So, what should we do today?

U.S. imperialism has already taken action on its own and is engaged in aggression. Should we continue to launch the signature campaign to defend peace?

Compatriots! I can responsibly answer: Yes, we must continue to launch it, and we must intensify it.

The meaning of defending peace is to oppose the imperialist war of aggression. Banning the use of atomic weapons is in fact banning the use of any weapons for aggression. Therefore, our signature campaign is not seeking peace with the imperialists, but demonstrating to the imperialists. We are swearing to mobilize the broad masses to oppose aggression. The imperialists also know this meaning very clearly, so they refuse peace delegations to enter the country, suppress peace movements in their own countries, and sometimes want to disguise themselves to deceive the people. This proves that the mobilization of the peace movement in our hands is indeed an effective weapon.

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has designated July 1st to July 7th as Peace Declaration Signature Campaign Week. This intention is very profound. July 1st is the anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and July 7th is the anniversary of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese war under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The People's Political Consultative Conference designates these seven days as Peace Movement Week, hoping that the people of the whole country will deeply commemorate the efforts of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to strive for peace, always follow the Communist Party, thoroughly resist the aggression of the imperialists, and finally achieve a comprehensive victory.

The July 7th commemoration more clearly tells us: The Soviet Union was the first to help us in the Anti-Japanese War, and it was also the Soviet Union that sent troops to Manchuria in the end to help us liberate the Northeast and jointly defeat Japanese imperialism. The Soviet Union is our closest ally.

Therefore, we should clearly remind ourselves of this understanding: As long as we are closely united under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and closely join hands with our allied Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, we can overcome any imperialist aggression.

We should also contribute this experience to the people of all of Asia who are suffering from the aggression of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, already wounded all over and not scary at all. Its act of turning black and white upside down is just a good indicator for us. We should not do what it wants us to do, and we should do what it does not want us to do. It wants to oppose the Soviet Union and communism, so we should unite under the leadership of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. It wants to carry out aggression, so we should oppose aggression and defend peace.

The entire Chinese people unite as one to defend peace and oppose the aggressive bandit U.S. imperialism!

The people of all Asia unite as one to defend peace and oppose the aggressive bandit U.S. imperialism!

The progressive people of the whole world unite as one to defend peace and oppose the aggressive bandit U.S. imperialism!

Long live the victory of the democratic peace camp!

　　由美帝国主义的侵略罪行说到和平宣言签名运动
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若七月一日在中央人民广播电台广播词全国的同胞们！
    今天在侵略集团中带头的美帝国主义，愈见嚣张得不成样子了。大家都知道，麦克阿瑟在日本，最近把日本的战争罪犯大批释放了，而对争取日本人民解放的日本共产党员却加以整肃、逮捕、投狱。一切都是倒行逆施，完全承受了东条英机的衣钵。
    杜鲁门在六月二十七日所发表的挑战声明，更加是无耻狂妄。朝鲜人民要解放朝鲜。杜鲁门说这是朝鲜人“侵略”朝鲜，而命令美国的海空军去“保护”。麦克阿瑟也就公然发动了美国的海空军。台湾是中国的台湾，美国的所谓第七舰队竟“在该地区执行合法而必要的职务”，杜鲁门竟公然“命令第七舰队阻止对台湾的任何攻击”。除掉法西斯主义者之外，天地间有这样的逻辑吗？
    美帝国主义向来是比较善于欺骗的，一向把民主自由当成了专卖特许的美国商品。一些受了麻醉的人，也总觉得美国是民主自由的。请看今天美帝国主义战争贩子们的这狰狞面貌吧！你的是我的，我的也还是我的。这就是美国式的“民主”，也就是美国式的“自由”！
    但是美帝国主义者，这样扯破它的假面具、露出一付狰狞的面貌来，倒也并不显示出它的坚强，而实在显示出它的脆弱。美帝国主义是看到了它的一群东方走狗，蒋介石、李承晚、季里诺、吉田茂之流在人民面前都虚脱无力，太不中用，故不得不自己动手来干。落得强盗头子自己动手，这正证明强盗集团的凋零了。
    全国同胞们！美帝国主义对于我们中国的侵略，倒不从今天开始，我们早就是领略够了的。特别是在日本帝国主义投降前后，美帝国主义以全力支持蒋介石反动派，那时候多么威风呵，把中国的四分之三都几乎美国化了。然而今天怎么样呢？只剩下一个台湾岛，被蒋介石选作坟墓了。不肯接受教训的美帝国主义者竟死不甘心，还要投些殉葬品下去，还要做日本帝国主义第二，那当然也是杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流的战争贩子的自由。
    我们中国人民对于帝国主义的本质已经认识得很清楚，对于美帝国主义的虚实尤其认识得很清楚。
    今天帝国主义的发展是已经走到无可挽救的末路了。尽管美帝国主义在两次世界大战中讨了很大的便宜，发了很大的横财，使它成为了最强大的帝国主义国家，然而它是外强中干的。二次大战结束以来，特别在最近两三年，生产量不断地降低，失业者不断地加多。去年十月的生产量比前年十月降低了百分之二十二。去年年底的失业者，根据官方的统计，是一千八百万人。这些数字正表明美帝国主义者是肺结核的三期患者，这也就使得它心急性躁，每天都在发烧。
    和这形成对比的是社会主义国家的苏联。苏联尽管在二次大战中牺牲最大，然而战后的恢复却也最快。一九四九年的全国总收入比战前一九四○年已超过了百分之三十六。苏联不仅没有失业者，工人和农民的生活一般都提高了，拿生活水平来说，工人提高了百分之二十四，农民提高了百分之三十。
    这样一个对比说明了个人本位的资本主义制度与人民本位的社会主义制度本质上的优劣。我们中国人民和全世界没有受到蒙蔽的善良的人民都看的很清楚，为了自己的和平幸福，谁都愿意走社会主义的路，谁都愿意受共产党的领导，而拥护苏联的和平政策。
    尽管美帝国主义者颠倒黑白，天天在叫嚣着反苏反共，全世界没有受到蒙蔽的人民谁都知道，反苏反共实质上就是反人民。反苏、反共、反人民者的末路历史上是已经有了明证的，并不是太长久的历史，而只是五六年前的现实。
    全中国的同胞们，美帝国主义者在和平竞赛中是失掉了自信的，它们当然也有眼睛，看到了苏联的日益繁荣，和平阵营的日益壮大，又看到了自己的日益萧条，侵略阵营的日益寥落，便不得不日益失掉镇静，日益走上法西斯化的道路。尽管希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机的殷鉴不远，然而他们是不到黄河心不死的。强盗在赶路，想快点走上断头台，难道我们还会为他惋惜吗？
    那么我们今天该怎样办？
    美帝国主义已经实际自行动手、从事侵略了，我们是不是还是要继续展开保卫和平的签名运动呢？
    同胞们！我可以负责的回答：是的，我们还是要继续展开，而且要加紧地展开。
    保卫和平的意义就是反对帝国主义的侵略战争。禁止使用原子武器，事实上也就是禁止使用任何武器从事侵略。因此，我们的签名运动，并不是向帝国主义者求和，而是向帝国主义者示威。我们是宣誓：要动员广大的群众来反对侵略。这层意义，帝国主义者也是知道得很清楚的，所以它们拒绝和平代表团入境，镇压本国的和平运动，有时也想伪装一下来欺骗人民。这就证明，和平运动的动员在我们手里的确是有效的武器。
    人民政协全国委员会把七月一日至七月七日作为和平宣言签名运动周，这用意是很深长的。七月一日中国共产党的建党纪念，七月七日是中国人民在中国共产党领导之下的抗日纪念。人民政协把这七天定为和平运动周，也就是希望全国人民深深纪念中国共产党领导人民争取和平的努力，始终要跟着共产党走，彻底反抗帝国主义者的侵略，而最后得到全面的胜利。
    七七纪念更明白地告诉我们：最初帮助我们抗日的是苏联，最后在满洲出兵，帮助我们解放了东北，共同把日本帝国主义打倒了的也是苏联。苏联是我们最亲密的盟友。
    因此，我们应该明确地提醒这项认识：只要紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，和盟邦苏联及其它兄弟国家密切地携手，任何帝国主义的侵略我们是可以克服的。
    我们并且应该把这项经验贡献给受着美帝国主义侵略的全亚洲的人民。美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，已经被戳得遍体鳞伤，一点也不可怕。它的颠倒黑白的行动倒也正好是我们的一个指标。它希望我们做的我们就不要做，它不希望我们做的我们就正好做。它要反苏反共，我们就在苏联和共产党的领导之下团结起来。它要实行侵略，我们就反对侵略，保卫和平。
    全中国人民一致团结起来，保卫和平、反对从事侵略的强盗美帝国主义！
    全亚细亚的人民一致团结起来，保卫和平，反对从事侵略的强盗美帝国主义！
    全世界进步的人民一致团结起来，保卫和平，反对从事侵略的强盗美帝国主义！
    民主和平阵营胜利万岁！
