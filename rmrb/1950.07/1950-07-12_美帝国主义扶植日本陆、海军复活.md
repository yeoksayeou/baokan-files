　　U.S. Imperialism Fosters the Revival of the Japanese Army and Navy

　　In the nearly five years of its exclusive occupation of Japan, U.S. imperialism has actively re-armed Japan and fostered the revival of Japanese militarist forces in order to serve as a tool for U.S. aggression in the Far East. The Japanese police, fostered single-handedly by MacArthur, is a disguised army and this is an indisputable fact. Before the war, Japan had 65,000 policemen. Now, according to the official and greatly reduced figures, the national and local police, together with the autonomous body police, total 125,000, not to mention the 2 million special police (police reserve) filled by firefighters. Under American equipment, Japanese police not only have pistols, but also armored vehicles, light tanks, and radio vehicles. The entire equipment is rapidly heading towards modern militarization. The Japanese government divides the country into six police control areas: Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka. These six police control areas are exactly the six military control areas before the war.

　　In the past six months, MacArthur has been actively planning to further expand the Japanese police and formally reorganize them into armed forces. His recent authorization to the Yoshida government to establish a so-called "Police Reserve Force" of 75,000 men is the public initial implementation of this plan. As early as mid-February this year, the Dentsu News Agency revealed that Whitney, head of the Government Affairs Section of MacArthur Headquarters, had submitted a secret memorandum to the Yoshida government proposing to "reorganize" the Japanese police into an armed force of 500,000 men. In the memorandum, the American authorities put forward detailed outlines for the location of barracks for troop training. According to the US plan, 400,000 to 500,000 Japanese police will be recruited in the first half of this year. The new Japanese police will become the core of the future army and will train future officers. They will be organized in the American way and will be trained by US Army officers. At the same time, the United States has also ordered a large amount of war equipment from Japanese war industries, part of which will be used to arm 450,000 new Japanese "police" in the first half of this year. The "Maritime Safety Agency," which nominally belongs to the Japanese government's Ministry of Transport, is actually a disguised Ministry of the Navy. The "Maritime Safety Agency" was established by MacArthur in April 1948, on the pretext of "preventing smuggling," when he ordered the Japanese government to establish it. On May 1 of the same year, the agency quickly announced its establishment and established branches such as "Maritime Security Headquarters," "Security Department," "Police Stations," and "Offices" in Yokohama, Nagoya, Maizuru, Kobe, Hiroshima, Moji, Sasebo, and Nagasaki. Many of these places were former Japanese naval ports. At the beginning of its establishment, the agency had 38 ships. In the past two years, the US authorities have continuously supplemented it. Recently, they handed over 14 former Japanese Navy warships and 27 small warships that the Soviet Union returned to the United States in 1949 to the Yoshida government, and ordered Mitsubishi to quickly repair 86 former Japanese Navy warships for use by the "Maritime Safety Agency." According to a Tokyo dispatch from Agence France-Presse on July 8, the number of patrol boats of the "Maritime Safety Agency" has now reached 300 and is preparing to increase to 600.

　　Many of the responsible personnel of the "Maritime Safety Agency" are former Japanese Navy officers. For example, the management section chief of the Maritime Police Central Security Bureau is former Navy Captain Yasuji Watanabe, and the mine sweeping section chief is former Navy Rear Admiral Hisazo Tamura. The original armed personnel of the agency, according to the officially reduced figure, is 8,000. After MacArthur ordered an increase of 8,000 this time, the agency's armed personnel will be at least 16,000 or more. After the US government handed over the aforementioned 27 warships that had been leased by the Soviet Union during the war, the Yoshida government has begun recruiting 2,000 sailors to serve on these warships. The United States also plans to mobilize 50,000 former Japanese naval officers in the first half of this year, retrain them with American experts, and form a new Japanese armed force.

### 美帝国主义扶植日本陆、海军复活

　　美帝国主义扶植日本陆、海军复活
    美帝国主义在单独占领日本的将近五年中，积极地重新武装日本，扶植日本军国主义势力复活，以便充当美国在远东的侵略工具。为麦克阿瑟所一手扶植的日本警察是变相的陆军，已是一个无可争辩的事实。战前日本共有警察六万五千人，现在据官方发表的大大缩小了的数字，仅国家地方警察与自治体警察，共为十二万五千人，由消防队员充任的特别警察（警察后备军）有二百万人。所谓海上警察、铁路警察和经济警察等尚未计算在内。在美国的装备之下，日本警察不但有手枪，并且有装甲车、轻型坦克和无线电车等，整个的装备正迅速地走向现代军队化。日本政府将全国划为札幌、仙台、东京、大阪、广岛与福冈六个警管区，而这六个警管区正是战前的六个军管区。
    最近半年以来，麦克阿瑟更在积极筹划将日本警察再加扩大并正式改编为武装部队。他这次授权吉田政府建立所谓“警察后备队”七万五千人，就是这一计划的公开的初步的实行。电通社早在今年二月中旬即已揭露，麦克阿瑟总部政府事务组组长惠特奈曾向吉田政府提出将日本警察“改编”为五十万人武装部队的秘密备忘录，美国当局在备忘录中对于部队训练的营房的所在地，都提出了详细的纲要。根据美国的计划，在今年上半年，将征募日本警察四十万至五十万人。新的日本警察将成为未来军队的核心，并将训练未来的军官。他们将仿效美国的方式组织，并将由美国陆军军官训练。同时，美国并向日本战争工业订购了大量战争装备，其中一部分就是用来在今年上半年武装四十五万新的日本“警察”的。表面上属于日本政府运输省的“海上保安厅”，实际上就是变相的海军省。“海上保安厅”是麦克阿瑟借口“防止走私”，在一九四八年四月命令日本政府建立的。同年五月一日，该厅就迅速地宣告成立，并在横滨、名古屋、舞鹤、神户、广岛、门司、佐世保及长崎等地遍设“海上保安本部”、“保安部”、“派出所”及“办事处”等分枝机构；这些地方有许多都是前日本海军军港。该厅设立之初，就有舰艇三十八艘。两年以来，美国当局不断予以补充。最近，他们曾先后将前日本海军军舰十四艘及苏联在一九四九年归还美国的小型军舰二十七艘等，交给吉田政府，并命令三菱公司迅速地修理前日本海军军舰八十六艘，以便交给“海上保安厅”使用。据七月八日法新社东京电透露，“海上保安厅”的巡逻艇数目现在已达三百艘，并准备增加到六百艘。
    “海上保安厅”的负责人员很多是前日本海军军人。例如，海上警察中枢保安局的管理科长是前海军上校渡边安次，扫海科长是前海军少将田村久三。该厅原有的武装人员，据官方发表的缩小了的数字是八千人。根据麦克阿瑟这次指令增加八千人后，该厅的武装人员至少在一万六千人以上。吉田政府在美国政府交给它上述战时曾为苏联所租借的二十七艘军舰后，已开始招募二千名水兵到这些军舰上服役。美国还计划要在今年上半年中动员前日本海军军官五万名，由美国专家加以重新训练，组成一支新的日本武装部队。
