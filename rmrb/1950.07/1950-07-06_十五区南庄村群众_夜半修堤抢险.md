　　Masses of Nanzhuang Village, Fifteenth District
    Repair Dike and Fight Flood at Midnight
    [This newspaper reports] On the night of June 30th, the masses of Nanzhuang Village in the Fifteenth District of Beijing suburbs, under the leadership of district and village cadres, as well as Party and Youth League members, victoriously completed an emergency rescue task on a section of the Yongding River near Lugou Bridge after a half-night of struggle.
    After receiving a notice from the Beijing Flood Control Headquarters on the afternoon of June 30th, the Fifteenth District government immediately sent personnel to Nanzhuangzi Village to mobilize the masses to organize a flood rescue team. At 12:15 a.m. that night, the Flood Control Headquarters issued an emergency mobilization order, requiring Nanzhuangzi Village to gather laborers for emergency rescue before 1:00 a.m. When the gong was sounded to gather people, all the laborers, scattered over a distance of two to three *li*, gathered in only forty minutes. They arrived at the work site at 1:30 a.m., and immediately used more than a thousand sandbags to raise the dike. At 4:10 a.m., the upstream flood suddenly rushed down, and the water level rose sharply by more than a foot, leveling with the heightened dike, creating a critical situation. All personnel participating in the emergency rescue, regardless of their own safety, piled sandbags to raise the dike and entered the water to plug the leaks. By 6:30 a.m., the upstream water gradually stabilized, and the emergency rescue task was victoriously completed.

　　十五区南庄村群众
    夜半修堤抢险
    【本报讯】六月三十日夜，京郊十五区南庄村群众在区、村干部及党、团员带头领导下，经半夜搏斗，胜利完成永定河芦沟桥附近某段抢险任务。
    十五区区政府于三十日下午接到北京防汛指挥部通知后，立即派员赴南庄子村动员群众组织抢险队。当夜十二时十五分，防汛指挥部发出紧急动员令，要南庄子村在夜间一时前集合民工抢险。当时鸣锣集合，仅四十分钟，分散距离达二、三里的民工全体聚齐。到达工作地点时为一时半，即时将一千余条麻袋装满砂土加高了堤防。四时十分，上游大水突然冲下，水面陡涨一尺多，已与加高后之堤相平，形势危急。全体参加抢险人员，奋不顾身，堆麻袋加高堤岸，并进入水中堵塞漏洞。直至六时半，上游水势逐渐平定，抢险任务，胜利完成。
