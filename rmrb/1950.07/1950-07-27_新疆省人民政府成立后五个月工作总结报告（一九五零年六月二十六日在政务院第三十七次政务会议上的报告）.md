Summary Report of Five Months of Work After the Establishment of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government
(Report at the 37th Government Affairs Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 26, 1950)
Bao Erhan

After the establishment of the Provincial People's Government, the vast number of workers, peasants, laborers, and young intellectuals showed a high degree of enthusiasm for democracy and social reform. However, on the other hand, Kuomintang bandits and special agents were lurking among the masses, colluding with American spies and local bullies to spread rumors, cause trouble, and disrupt social order. The Provincial People's Government resolutely adhered to the Common Program and the central government's policies, actively working hard and accomplishing the following tasks:

	A. What Work Was Done?

	I. Establishing and Transforming Government Organizations at All Levels

	1. After the establishment of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, the current policy of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Committee was adopted at the first meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. This policy not only implemented the spirit of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but also took into account the specific circumstances of Xinjiang's complex ethnic composition. In the past five months, the Provincial People's Government has carried out all its work based on this policy, which has been supported by the broad masses of people from all ethnic groups, sectors, and classes.

	2. Conducting takeover work in a planned manner: After the peaceful liberation of the province, the heads of various provincial-level agencies and seven districts and counties, including Dihua, Hami, Yanqi, Aksu, Kashi, Hotan, and Shache, under the Kuomintang government were either waiting to be taken over, had fled, or were taking advantage of the situation to make a quick buck. The work of various departments had virtually come to a standstill. In the case of the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan districts, due to their long-term independent work, the Provincial People's Government had not yet had time to unify them after its establishment. Based on these circumstances, the Provincial Committee decided that the focus of work for January, February, and March should be on taking over the cities first. Over the past five months, the government and the army have been working separately, and the takeover work has now been largely completed. All enterprises and institutions have begun their work under the unified leadership of the Provincial People's Government.

	3. Assigning cadres and transforming their thinking and work style: The number of cadres from the old liberated areas in the province is extremely small, and there are not many original revolutionary cadres either. The vast majority are civil servants who have been retained. However, among those retained, there are Kuomintang special agents, corrupt elements, and bureaucratic elements. In the past five months, we have launched the "Three-Anti Movement" (anti-espionage, anti-corruption, and anti-bureaucracy) in government agencies, purged a number of special agents, prosecuted several of the worst persistent corrupt elements who refused to change, and educated bureaucratic elements. In the "Three-Anti Movement," we have always adhered to the policy of learning from the past to avoid future mistakes and curing diseases to save people. Special agents and corrupt elements are treated differently. Those who were corrupt before liberation are mainly given political education, while those who have been educated since liberation but are still corrupt are punished according to law. To carry out this movement, the Provincial Government established a General Study Committee to uniformly lead the study of government organs at all levels. Various departments and special districts established branch study committees, and units affiliated with departments and county-level governments established sub-branches, which were divided into groups for study, establishing a two-hour daily study system. Through the Three-Anti Movement and study, a number of activists have emerged. They have been assigned and promoted to appropriate positions. In the assignment of cadres, we have always adhered to the ethnic policy and taken care of ethnic minority cadres. To educate and transform surplus personnel and some unemployed civil servants, an administrative personnel training class was established, with a total of 1,127 students (including 98 women). The training class started in early April. After studying and participating in the "Three-Anti Movement," government employees generally developed the idea of serving the people and began to change their old bureaucratic and formalistic work style, initially establishing a new work style and enthusiasm for participating in production. To improve administrative efficiency and gradually overcome red tape and formalism, various systems have been formulated, stipulating the matters to be managed by various departments and simplifying official procedures, implementing joint office work, and issuing regulations on the establishment of a reporting system.

	4. Convening people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups and sectors in each county is one of the central tasks of the government. Except for Tacheng and Ashan, which have not yet reported, most of the others have already been convened. At the meetings, problems such as suppressing bandits and opposing local despots, production, mobilizing the masses, and abolishing the Baojia system were jointly resolved. In general, the meetings focused on production work; in areas with bandits, such as Hami, Qitai, and Fuyuan, the focus was on suppressing bandits. Through the convening of representative conferences of various ethnic groups and sectors, not only were the masses connected and the government's prestige enhanced, but also the masses were helped with production and problems that had not been solved for many years were resolved. For example, the water conservancy disputes between Shache and Zepu, and between Maigaiti and Yecheng, which had lasted for fifty years, and the disputes over livestock pastures between the Han and Kazakh ethnic groups in Changji, have all been resolved satisfactorily.

	5. Abolishing the Baojia system and establishing people's power: The Baojia system was particularly dark in Xinjiang. The common people said: Only by abolishing the Baojia system can we see the light of day. Now, Dihua City, Qiande, Dihua, Toksun, Qitai and other counties have completed this work, and other counties are continuing to transform or preparing for transformation. After destroying all five districts and fifty-four Bao of the old regime in Dihua City, fifty-four street (township) offices were established, initially establishing grassroots work for the people's regime, and a total of one hundred and nine street (township) chiefs and deputy chiefs, seven hundred and twenty-three representatives, and one hundred and fifty-four representatives' directors (nine full-time, the rest concurrently held by representatives) were elected, including seventeen female representatives. In terms of ethnic composition, there are one hundred and seventy-six Uighurs, two hundred and four Hui, four hundred and fifty-five Han, four Kazakhs, and two Russians. The vast majority of representatives are poor urban residents, peasants, small vendors, and some middle peasants. The ten townships of Qiande have also destroyed the old regime and established people's power, with agricultural associations established in seven townships. When destroying the Baojia system in the county, the district cadres first found activists to form agricultural associations, and then the members publicized to the masses, developed members, and united the activists to organize village government. This experience has been widely applied in various counties of the Dihua District.

	II. Financial and Economic Work

	1. Before liberation, Xinjiang's economy was in a state of total collapse, with all expenditures relying on issuance and financial deficits almost impossible to calculate. After the establishment of the People's Government, the financial and economic departments immediately began to rectify the situation. In the past four months, although our implementation of the central government's unified financial and economic policies has been insufficient and our leadership has not been tight enough, we have made significant achievements in stabilizing finance and prices, rectifying taxation, and clearing warehouse materials. In order to stabilize finance and prices, we first restored the long-stalled transportation within and outside the province, enabling the exchange of materials between the province and the countryside and pastoral areas, and allowing provincial currency to circulate into rural and pastoral areas. We opened up remittances within and outside the province, which has brought back a large number of banknotes. We appropriately controlled a batch of materials and flexibly allocated them. At the same time, we tried our best to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, rectify taxation, and tighten expenses. In terms of rectifying taxation, taking Dihua as an example, the various taxes in January this year were 400,000, and in April they reached about 5 million, an increase of more than ten times. It is reported that the outer districts and counties have completed the planned figures, and some have even exceeded the plan. Therefore, it can be seen that tax revenue can still be increased in the future. In terms of tightening expenditures, administrative personnel have been reduced and administrative expenses have been reduced. According to statistics, living expenses accounted for 69.15% of the estimated expenditure in January; in March, living expenses accounted for 67%; living expenses have been reduced, and the relative expenses for undertakings have increased. The government's financial deficit has also been reduced.

	Secondly, in terms of promoting the sale of Victory Discount Public Bonds: The Northwest Region Promotion Committee allocated 200,000 shares to our province. After several months of promotion, the total task has been successfully completed, and there is a surplus. By the first half of May, 200,000 shares have been collected.

	Furthermore, regarding the solution of the People's Liberation Army's food problem, the Provincial People's Government and the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army decided on measures to borrow and purchase grain. Thanks to the active support of the people, the Hami District, Yanqi District, and Dihua District have borrowed and purchased a total of 64,322 Shi 1 Dou 6 Sheng in the past four months. In addition, the People's Liberation Army has been warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups in various places. The people in various places have automatically lent grain, cattle, tools, seeds, and carts and horses, providing help and encouragement both spiritually and materially. This not only solved the PLA's food shortage, ensured the food supply for the smooth implementation of the 1950 large-scale production movement, but also reduced part of the burden on the government's financial difficulties in 1950.

	In terms of clearing warehouse materials: Our province established the Xinjiang Branch of the National Warehouse Material Clearing Committee in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government. Branches were set up in various districts and counties. As of now, Dihua City alone has found unregistered materials with a minimum estimated value of approximately 2 billion RMB. In addition, the former Real Estate Inventory Committee inventoried public vehicles, horses, and bedding in various agencies worth approximately 720 million RMB.

	2. After the establishment of the Provincial People's Government, the organization of the trade company was restored. In the past four months, the Aksu, Kashi, and Yanqi branch companies were successively established. The development companies in the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan districts were reorganized and unified. The Horgos and Korla offices were established. The trade company is now concentrating its efforts on purchasing local products and preparing to complete the task of exporting local products.

	3. In the past four months, expanding spring plowing and production has become our main task, and all work has revolved around this movement. The People's Liberation Army in the new province plans to cultivate 600,000 Mu of cultivated land this year. Judging from the current situation, it will not only complete the plan, but may also exceed it by 150,000 Mu. At the same time, spring plowing work in various districts and counties has also been universally and enthusiastically launched, especially in areas where people's representative conferences have been held. The representative conferences have organized the farmers, launched rural mutual aid movements, and adjusted land, seeds, plowing cattle, and farm tools. The counties in the Dihua District have borrowed a total of 1,307 Shi 2 Dou 4 Sheng of seeds from each other, publicly borrowed 1,250 Shi of seeds, mutually borrowed 361 plowing cattle, 44 horses, adjusted 832 Mu of land, solved 109 farm tools (iron hoes), 3,600 Jin of pasture, and repaired a total of 15 kilometers of irrigation canals. To cooperate with this large-scale production movement, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has sent four working teams with the army to work in Shawan, Yili, Yanqi, and Aksu. In the past four months, the Department of Water Conservancy has assisted the army and repaired six irrigation canals: (1) Dihua completed the laying of stone slabs on approximately 12 kilometers of the Heping Canal and the partial renovation of approximately 17 kilometers of the head of the canal. The new canal of Xia Sigong with a length of about 13 kilometers and the drainage canal of Hongyanchi Reservoir can irrigate 36,000 Mu of land. (2) The canal excavation and dam project of the Taiping Xinsheng Canals in Shawan were completed at the end of April, which can irrigate about 60,000 Mu of land. (3) Suilai reorganized the old canals, which can irrigate about 20,000 Mu of land. (4) The Xiaoguai canal and dam project are being rushed to repair, which can irrigate 20,000 Mu of land. (5) Yanqi, on the south bank of the Kaidu River, reorganized and expanded five canals (Daxia Balun Canal, Kailai Canal), and on the north bank, reorganized and improved two canals (Heshuotan Canal including Stan Canal), which can irrigate about 60,000 Mu. (6) Aksu reorganized the Duolang Canal and Dahan Canal and excavated branch canals, and excavated a new canal, Quanshui Gou, on the Weigan River in Kuche, which can irrigate about 30,000 Mu. (7) In Yili, 110,000 soldiers and civilians were mobilized to excavate and renovate the Huang Canal, which is 97 kilometers long and can irrigate 250,000 to 300,000 Mu of land. A total of approximately 500,000 Mu of land can be irrigated in seven locations.

	4. Animal husbandry in Xinjiang is second only to agriculture. Before liberation, although the pseudo-Construction Department had institutions such as breeding farms and agricultural and pastoral farms, they were all nominal. The number of livestock has not only failed to reproduce in recent years, but the mortality rate is extremely high. After the establishment of the Animal Husbandry Department, it first carried out the work of reorganizing institutions. It took over the Dihua, Yili, and Tacheng breeding farms, the Yanqi agricultural and pastoral farm, the Kuche and Kashi breeding sheep farms, the animal disease prevention stations in nine districts including Dihua and Kashi, the animal hospitals in the Yili District, and the Dihua Serum Factory. Based on the current actual situation of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, it reorganized and added four livestock farms in Dihua, Yili, Tacheng, and Yanqi, and sheep farms in Ashan, Kashi, and Kuche districts and counties. In terms of veterinary medicine, it reorganized and added veterinary hospitals in five districts including Dihua, Yili, Tacheng, Yanqi, and Kashi, veterinary branches in five districts including Ashan, Aksu, Hotan, Shache, and Hami, and fifteen veterinary prevention stations in Turpan, Suilai, and other counties, and twenty-six animal disease prevention sub-stations in Muleihe, Henan, and Huocheng. At present, the Dihua and Yili district livestock farms and veterinary hospitals have been reorganized, and the veterinary and animal husbandry institutions in other counties are still operating with the original institutions.

	5. Xinjiang's industry is extremely backward. Although there were seven units under the pseudo-Construction Department in the past, including the Dihua Coal Mine, Iron Factory, Sulfuric Acid Factory, Glass Factory, Geological Survey Institute, and Gold Mine Bureau, as well as the Hotan Silk Weaving Factory, Dushanzi Oil Mine, and Ashan Gold Mine, they were all nominal and could not even talk about self-sufficiency. After the establishment of the Provincial People's Government, it concentrated its efforts on rectification, restoration, and transformation in the past five months, and established factory management committees and trade unions. For example, the original plan of the Badaowan Coal Mine was to produce 130,000 baskets of coal per year, requiring government subsidies of 2.7 million yuan. However, after rectification, the plan is to produce 200,000 baskets of coal per year, requiring only 700,000 yuan in government subsidies to maintain. Other factories, such as the Ceramics Factory and the Silk Weaving Factory, have also gradually increased their output after rectification, reducing a large amount of government expenditure. At present, although it is still quite far from the goal of self-sufficiency, it is striving to move towards enterprise.

	III. Cultural and Educational Work

	1. Regarding the improvement of education, the current educational improvement work in our province mainly focuses on reorganizing, restoring, and transforming schools at all levels, thoroughly abolishing the Kuomintang's reactionary education system, correcting curriculum content, and strengthening the ideological transformation of teachers and staff. Although there are more than 1,400 public schools at all levels in Xinjiang, they are not uniform in terms of academic system and equipment, and they are decadent and outdated, and the number of students is insufficient. In this situation, we first carried out key rectification work in Dihua City, and then gradually expanded to outer districts and counties in a planned and step-by-step manner. In the educational improvement work in Dihua City, we have carried out the work of merging schools and classes, and filling student quotas in terms of reorganizing schools. In terms of correcting curriculum content, textbooks that were anti-communist and anti-people in the past have been completely banned. Various political, historical, and Chinese language textbooks for primary and secondary schools will be completely resolved soon. Uighur and Kazakh language textbooks are currently being translated and will be resolved soon. Regarding the ideological transformation of teachers and staff, in addition to individual transfers to participate in training classes for study and transformation, study committees have been established in schools at all levels, and seminars are held regularly for study. Since the beginning of May, cadres from the Provincial Department of Education and the current graduates of the Normal School plan to form twelve groups to go to various counties in the Dihua District to carry out educational reform work.

	2. Regarding cultural construction work: (1) News media: After the Chinese Xinjiang Daily was reorganized and launched on December 6 last year, it actively engaged in adjusting personnel, enriching content, and expanding distribution. In January this year, a total of 242,271 copies were distributed, in February a total of 244,441 copies, and in March a total of 330,641 copies. The distribution network has been expanded to 56 counties in the province. In January this year, the Uighur and Kazakh Xinjiang Daily distributed 30,821 copies, in February 41,871 copies, and in March 70,295 copies. One of the reasons why the distribution of Uighur newspapers is less than that of Chinese newspapers is that the southern Xinjiang districts and counties were subjected to various restrictions on reading Uighur newspapers during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. This bad result requires long-term efforts to overcome. The circulation of the above two provincial newspapers has more than doubled since liberation, and other local newspapers are also being improved. Eleven reporters from the Xinjiang Branch of the Xinhua News Agency are stationed in Dihua, Hami, Suilai, Yili, Tacheng, and A, and regularly supply稿件 to Xi'an and Beijing. The Dihua People's Broadcasting Station broadcasts for 1,260 minutes per week, three hours per day. The program content is divided into news, lectures, relays, and entertainment. The station plans to set up eight radio stations in outer districts and counties, and plans to purchase larger-powered broadcasting machines so that cities farther away such as Hotan can listen. (2) Literary and artistic work: Before the reorganization, the Youth Song and Dance Troupe was the Uyghur Opera Troupe. It has absorbed newly-entered song, dance, and drama personnel to expand performance work. In dance art, it has created new forms and is now engaged in the creation or adaptation of scripts with new democratic content. The Ha Ke Opera Troupe performed the "Kalinmar" opera in March and regularly broadcasts music programs on the radio station. (3) Compilation and translation work: The Uyghur books that have been translated, revised three times, and reviewed for printing include the CPPCC documents, On the People's Democratic Dictatorship, On New Democracy, Mao Zedong's Outlook on Life, and The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party. The one book that has been translated, revised, and reviewed but not yet printed is Chairman Mao's Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. There are 19 translated but unrevised books. The Kazakh books that have been translated and printed include the CPPCC documents and On New Democracy. The one book that has been translated but not reviewed is Mao Zedong's Outlook on Life. A total of 25 Uyghur books with 345,218 characters and three Kazakh books with 56,640 characters have been translated, and four other documents have been revised. (4) Publishing Department: The Xinjiang General Branch of the Xinhua Bookstore has begun operations. It is now preparing to set up the Dihua Southern Xinjiang Branch and expand its business. The printing factory of the bookstore has printed three types of books: 5,000 copies of the CPPCC documents, 5,000 copies of the CCP Constitution, and 600 copies of the Collection of the Dihua City People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups. They have all been published and three books such as A Brief History of Social Development have been printed, totaling 16,000 copies. In addition, guidance and promotion work in the literary and artistic fields in Dihua City and the entire province and preparations for launching the film industry are also being carried out to understand the situation and make arrangements.

	IV. Public Security and Judicial Work

	1. The public security work in the past four months has focused on eradicating special agents. Special agents who have been formally managed and trained are undergoing political transformation and are organized to engage in labor production. According to current statistics, nearly 1,100 special agents have been registered throughout Xinjiang, 49 bandit and special agent radio stations have been seized, 3 machine guns, more than 180 rifles and pistols, more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, 140 codebooks, more than 600 radio parts, and eight boxes of explosives. The Kuomintang's special agent organization in Xinjiang has been basically destroyed, but this does not mean that it has been eradicated. It is necessary to carry out longer-term and arduous work to completely eradicate it. Secondly, in the past four months, 91 cases of bandits, theft, and drug trafficking have been solved in Dihua. More than 300 stragglers, vagrants, and unemployed people have been collected in Dihua, 40 in Fuyuan, and 70 in Toksun. Seventy petty thieves and pickpockets have been trained in Dihua City. Fifty prostitutes have been banned and transformed. In March, activities of reactionary gangs colluding with bandits to defect to Wusiman were cracked down on.

	In addition, regarding the transformation of the old police and the establishment of new public security forces, the Public Security Department took over the police cadre class run by the former Municipal Police Department. After three months of ideological education, some people were assigned to work in various places, and some remained in the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Municipal Public Security Bureau was reorganized, and some special agents and extremely bad elements were transferred to training and transformation, and new cadres were added, making the Municipal Public Security Bureau a new institution. Following this, the Provincial Public Security Brigade and the Dihua Public Security Team were established, and after ideological education, they were transformed into people's public security forces. People's Liberation Army personnel have been assigned to work in most county public security bureaus. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of cadre shortage, the Public Security Department recruited more than 250 students (including six ethnic groups) to open a public security school to train ethnic minority police cadres.

	2. Judicial work: In the past four months, the pseudo-Xinjiang High Court was reorganized into the Provincial People's Court, the pseudo-Dihua District Court was reorganized into the Municipal People's Court, the reactionary pseudo-Six Laws were abolished, and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the current policies of the province, and various laws and resolutions of the People's Government were used as the basis for handling cases. All litigation filing fees have been stopped. In April, we began to establish new institutions and new systems in accordance with the new establishment. In terms of clearing prisoners, Yili has been completed, clearing 242 people. Dihua has established a prisoner clearing committee and is carrying out the clearing. Other districts and counties will start this work.

	B. Reasons for Achieving Results

	In the four months since the establishment of the Provincial People's Government, it has done the above work and initially laid the foundation for the people's democratic regime. The main reasons for achieving such results are as follows:

	1. The correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee.

	2. The assistance of the People's Liberation Army: After the People's Liberation Army entered various regions of Xinjiang, it not only suppressed reactionaries, stabilized the local area, and consolidated victory, making the people of all ethnic groups and sectors feel as close to the heroic People's Liberation Army as brothers, but also took the lead under the call of labor production, setting off an unparalleled upsurge. It is planned to reclaim 600,000 Mu of wasteland throughout Xinjiang, and now it may exceed 150,000 Mu. In order to cooperate with production, six canals were newly dug and repaired, which can irrigate approximately 500,000 Mu of land. The Manas River Bridge was built. This bridge is the main road from Dihua through Yili to the Soviet Union, and was burned by the Kuomintang bandits in an attempt to prevent the advance of the Yili Revolutionary Army. The People's Liberation Army carried out the construction project in the severe cold weather of minus 30 degrees. The entire bridge is made of stone piers and wooden frames, 248 meters long, 9 meters wide, and 8 meters high, with a load capacity of 25 tons. There are 250-meter dikes on both sides to prevent flooding and can last for ten years. The great project that bourgeois engineers believed would take three years to complete was completed in four months. Because the People's Liberation Army overcame difficulties that were generally considered insurmountable with a spirit of courage and hard work, it gave very important help to the regime.

	3. The support of the people: The current policy formulated by the Provincial People's Government in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program, due to the correctness of the policy, the in-depth publicity and education, and the active work of various mass organizations, has been unanimously supported by the people. For example, the work of raising food and selling public bonds and the tax revenue of Dihua City were all successfully completed in a very short time.

	4. The efforts of government officials at all levels: Due to the leadership of the old cadres and the enlightening effect on the retained old personnel, they recognized their position and improved their work efficiency, and the work of various departments became automatic and active. The concerted efforts of all staff are also one of the reasons for achieving results.

	C. Shortcomings and Reasons

	In the course of our work, we have also found many shortcomings:

	1. Uneven development of work: Due to the small number of backbone cadres and insufficient distribution, we have assigned stronger cadres to more important areas. In some areas, the cadre allocation is weaker. The work of departments with more old cadres is lively and active, while those with fewer old cadres are slow to progress, forming a phenomenon of uneven development of work.

	2. Phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline: Our vertical connections are not enough, forming a phenomenon of disconnection between the top and bottom, failure to report work done, and failure to respond to orders. For example, some special districts in southern Xinjiang arbitrarily transferred county chiefs without the approval of the provincial government, and did not report afterwards. In the horizontal aspect, various departments have also failed to connect well, without exchanging information and experience, and some units still use the old style of managing without caring, each doing its own thing. The main reasons for these shortcomings are the lack of political and theoretical literacy and work experience of the cadres, and the political theory books have not been translated, making it inconvenient for some ethnic minority cadres to study. The leadership failed to grasp the supervision and inspection after arranging the work, and failed to organize on-the-spot inspections, which is the main reason. For example, the unified financial and economic decisions must be vigorously implemented, and the cadres' thinking must be opened up and corruption must be severely curbed. However, the leadership failed to grasp this work in the implementation, and there was a phenomenon of relaxation in some places.

	3. Xinjiang is a province with many ethnic groups, and different languages ​​and scripts. Whether in oral or written form, it must be translated to express meaning and understand each other. The lack of translators (many of the existing translators are not up to standard) is one of the reasons for reducing work efficiency. We are currently planning to establish a translation training class and plan to call on cadres of all ethnic groups to learn each other's languages ​​to overcome this difficulty.

	We are making great efforts to overcome these shortcomings, and we believe that they can be overcome in the near future.

	D. Experience

	1. The issue of centralization and unification: In accordance with the principles of the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the policy of our province, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, all work must be firmly implemented, and the results will be great. Conversely, if it cannot be firmly implemented, the results will be poor. For example, the routine work of the Xinjiang Provincial Financial and Economic Committee has not been carried out, and the tax work and financial system have not been established well, resulting in tax evasion and arbitrary spending by some departments.

	2. Be good at using criticism and self-criticism: If we want to transform the corrupt institutions, we cannot achieve the transformation goal if we cannot use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, it is clearer that if we do not transform the old and establish the new, it is impossible to complete the task. Therefore, if we want to transform the old and establish the new, we must use criticism and self-criticism.

	3. Ethnic policy: Appropriately and correctly grasp the ethnic policy of the Common Program. In addition to paying attention to the allocation of cadres of all ethnic groups, it is more important to pay attention to cultivating and promoting cadres of all ethnic groups. Cadres of all ethnic groups who have achieved success in work and study should be commended, and those with shortcomings should be given patient education and persuasion. We should patiently wait for their awakening. In short, we must firmly grasp the principles of equality, mutual assistance, and unity.

	E. Future Work

	In accordance with the report on the current tasks of the Northwest region made by Chairman Peng Dehuai at the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the current policy of our province, and based on the actual situation in Xinjiang, we have decided to do the following tasks in the next few months.

	1. The broad masses of people in Xinjiang have not yet been mobilized, and bandits, local bullies, and special agents are still rampant in the countryside. Therefore, continuing to suppress bandits, eliminate special agents, and oppose local bullies is still an important task in the future. At the same time, we must establish and improve agricultural associations and pastoral associations, set up labor bureaus, establish provincial trade unions, and other mass organizations that can be established. After the autumn harvest, in areas where conditions are ripe, we can try to reduce rent and appropriately reduce the exploitation of landlords.

	2. Transform grassroots regimes: Replenish grassroots cadres, establish grassroots regimes, and continue to appoint some cadres as commissioners, county chiefs, or deputy commissioners and deputy county chiefs to transform grassroots regimes and completely destroy the reactionary Baojia system. Districts that have not held representative conferences should be convened immediately, and those that have been convened should be convened once every three months. Convene a provincial people's representative conference of all ethnic groups. The purpose of this compilation is to achieve the goals of streamlining the establishment, saving expenses, re-evaluating cadres, and establishing the institutions that should be established, such as the Labor Bureau, the People's Supervision Committee, and the Procuratorate.

	3. Reorganize tax revenue throughout Xinjiang: Develop trade, strive to export local products, increase grain production, especially reorganize industrial institutions, prepare to jointly run two companies with the Soviet Union, and establish a strict supply system, strictly prohibit waste, and continue to report corruption to implement the unified financial policy.

	4. Continue to run administrative personnel training classes, rotate old employees, absorb new cadres, and strengthen the study of in-service cadres to improve the political level of general cadres and establish a world view of serving the people wholeheartedly. At the same time, we must strengthen the leadership of Xinjiang College, secondary schools throughout Xinjiang, and administrative personnel training classes at all levels to cultivate a large number of cadres of all ethnic groups. Xinjiang is a region with many ethnic groups. If we do not cultivate a large number of cadres of all ethnic groups to engage in various departments of work, the work will not be done well.

	5. After the liberation of our province, the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan and the seven districts of Dihua, Hami, Yanqi, Aksu, Kashi, Hotan, and Shache have gradually become unified in politics and economy. However, due to long-term isolation in the past, the current unity is not enough, and the thinking and work style of government cadres are not consistent enough. Therefore, the government should strengthen the idea of ​​unified leadership among cadres in the future, and should indeed implement the reporting system, strictly organize inspection and supervision, and effectively carry out criticism and self-criticism to do a good job.

	F. Suggestions

	1. Animal husbandry is second only to agriculture in the economy of our province. Therefore, developing animal husbandry in our province is indeed one of the important tasks at present. We propose that the existing Animal Husbandry Department of our province be retained to strengthen leadership and develop animal husbandry.

	2. Our province originally had a Water Conservancy Department, the main task of which was to develop water conservancy and cooperate with agricultural production. Because water conservancy and agricultural work are separated, it is easy to disconnect the work. In order to unify leadership and improve work efficiency, we propose that the original Water Conservancy Department of our province be changed to the Water Conservancy Bureau and be led by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry.

	3. Our province is a region with many ethnic groups. In the allocation of cadres in provincial-level agencies, we must take care of ethnic composition. Especially because of language barriers, all agencies must set up translators in order to promote work. Therefore, more staff are required in the establishment. The number of staff prescribed by the State Council in the newly issued establishment this time is determined according to the general situation of other provinces in the interior, which seems to be insufficient. We propose that the number of establishment personnel in provincial-level agencies be appropriately increased.

	4. The construction work of various departments in our province is being carried out separately, but the various specialized technical talents and leading cadres with political qualities required are extremely lacking, and the work is difficult to promote. In order to solve the current needs, please first send a group of specialized technical professors and leading cadres from the interior to Xinjiang to carry out work. On the other hand, in order to promote and train cadres of all ethnic groups in our province, we plan to set up special technical personnel training classes in our province and select outstanding young people to study specialized technologies in the Soviet Union and universities in the interior. Please give instructions on these issues.

	5. People's courts at all levels have been established and are being established in our province to promote judicial work, but because new civil and criminal laws have not been promulgated, there is no basis for handling cases. Please issue relevant laws and regulations as soon as possible.

　　新疆省人民政府成立后五个月工作总结报告
    （一九五零年六月二十六日在政务院第三十七次政务会议上的报告）
    鲍尔汉
    省人民政府成立后，广大的工农劳苦人民和青年知识分子，要求民主，要求社会改革的情绪相当高涨。但另一方面国民党匪特潜伏在群众中间，勾结美谍及恶霸，进行造谣滋事，破坏社会治安。省人民政府坚决地依照共同纲领及中央施政方针，积极努力，做了如下的工作：
        甲  作了些什么工作？
        一、建立和改造各级政权机构
    １、新疆省人民政府成立后，在第一次省府委员会议上，通过了新疆省人民政府委员会目前施政方针。这个方针不仅贯彻了人民政协共同纲领的精神，同时也照顾了新疆民族复杂的具体情况。五个月来，省人民政府根据这个方针，进行一切工作，得到各族各界各阶层广大人民的拥护。
    ２、有计划地进行接管工作：在本省和平解放之后，省级各机关以及迪化、哈密、焉耆、阿克苏、喀什、和阗、莎车等七个区各县的国民党政府负责人有的等候接收，有的跑了，有的混水摸鱼，乘机抓一把，各部门工作实际上已陷于停顿状态。伊犁、塔城、阿山三个区方面，由于长期独立的单独工作，省人民政府成立后，一时尚未及统一。根据这些情况，省委会决定一二三月工作中心，先从城市进行接管。五个月来政府与军队分头进行，接管工作现已大体完成，所有企业与事业机构已在省人民政府统一领导下展开工作。
    ３、配备干部和改造思想作风：本省来自老解放区的干部极少，原有的革命干部也不多，绝大部分是留用的公务人员。但留用人员内，有国特分子，贪污分子，官僚主义分子。五个月来我们在政府机构中开展了反特务、反贪污、反官僚主义的“三反运动”，清洗了一批特务分子，征办了几个最坏的一贯贪污而且坚决不改的分子，教育了官僚主义分子。在“三反运动”中，始终掌握着惩前毖后，治病救人的方针，对特务分子、贪污分子分别对待，对解放前贪污的人，以政治教育为主，对解放后经过教育而又贪污者，则依法惩办。为进行这种运动，由省府成立了总学习委员会统一领导各级政权机关的学习，各厅处专署成立了学习委员会分会，厅处附属单位及县级政府成立支会，分组进行学习，建立每日两小时学习制。经过三反运动和学习，涌现出不少的积极分子。他们已被分别配备和提拔到适当的工作岗位上去。在配备干部当中，始终掌握了民族政策，照顾民族干部。为编余人员及部分失业公务员的教育改造，成立了行政人员训练班，共计学员一千一百二十七人（内女性九十八人）。该训练班已于四月初旬开学。经过学习和“三反运动”之后，公职人员中一般的启发了为人民服务的思想，开始改变官僚主义和形式主义的旧作风，初步建立了新的工作作风与参加生产的劳动热情。为提高行政效率，逐渐克服文牍主义、形式主义，已制定各种制度，规定各厅处应掌管事项和简化公文手续的办法，实行联合办公，发布关于建立报告制度的规定。
    ４、召开各县各族各界人民代表会议，是政府的中心工作之一。除塔城、阿山还未见报告外，其他大部分已经召开。在会议上共同解决了剿匪反霸、生产、发动群众、废除保甲等问题。会议上一般都以生产工作为重心；在有匪的地方，如哈密、奇台、孚远等地，则以剿匪工作为重心。经过各族各界代表会议的召开，不但联系了群众，提高了政府的威信，并且帮助了群众生产，解决了多年来未能解决的问题。如莎车与泽普、麦盖提与叶城五十年来的水利纠纷，昌吉汉族与哈族牲畜牧场的纠纷等，都得到圆满的解决。
    ５、废除保甲，建立人民政权方面：保甲制度在新疆特别黑暗。老百姓说：只有把保甲废除，才算见了青天。现在迪化市、乾德、迪化、托克逊、奇台等县，已完成此项工作，其他各县正在继续改造或准备改造中。迪化市在摧毁全部五个区五十四个保的旧政权后，建立了五十四个街（乡）公所，初步建立了人民政权的基层工作，共选出正副街（乡）长一百零九人，代表七百二十三人，代表主任一百五十四人（专任九人，其余由代表兼任），其中并有妇女代表十七人。按民族成份来说，维族一百七十六人，回族二百零四人，汉族四百五十五人，哈族四人，俄罗斯族二人。代表绝大多数是贫苦市民、农民、小商贩，及部分中农。乾德十个乡也已摧毁了旧政权，而建立了人民政权，其中七个乡建立了农会组织。该县在摧毁保甲时，首先由区干部找积极分子成立农会，再由会员向群众宣传，发展会员，团结积极分子进行组织村政权。这一经验，已在迪化区各县广泛应用。
            二、财政经济工作
    １、新疆在解放之前，经济已呈总崩溃状态，一切的开支，全赖发行，财政赤字几于无法计算。人民政府成立后，财经部门即着手进行整顿工作，四个多月来，虽然我们对中央财经统一政策贯彻的不够，领导上抓的不紧，但在稳定金融物价、整顿税收、清理仓库物资等方面，都已获得不少成就。我们为了稳定金融物价，先把久已停滞的省内外交通恢复起来，使省内外和城乡间的物资交流，使省币转入乡村游牧地区。打开了省内外的汇兑，已使大批钞票回笼。适当地掌握了一批物资，灵活地予以调配。同时，则尽量开源节流，整顿税收，紧缩开支。在整顿税收方面，以迪化来讲，本年一月份的各种税收是四十万，四月份已达约五百万，增加了十几倍。据报外区县都已完成预计的数字，有的还超过计划。因此可以看出将来税收还可以增加。在紧缩开支方面，已缩减了行政人员，减少了行政费用，据统计一月份生活费占支出概算的百分之六十九点一五；三月份生活费占百分之六十七；生活费已在减少，相对的事业费方面则已有增加。政府财政上的赤字也已减少。
    其次在推销胜利折实公债方面：西北区推销委员会分配本省二十万分，几个月来推销结果，已经胜利完成总的任务，并有超额，至五月份上半月已收足二十万分。
    再如解决解放军的食粮问题，省人民政府和人民解放军新疆军区决定了借购粮的措施，由于人民积极的支援，四个多月来哈密区、焉耆区和迪化区总计借购六万四千三百二十二石一斗六升。此外人民解放军在各地更受到各民族人民的热烈拥护，各地人民自动的借给粮食、牛对、工具、籽种、车马，在精神上物质上都给了帮助与鼓励，这不但解决了军队食粮困难，保证部队顺利进行一九五零年的大生产运动的食粮供给，而且给一九五零年政府财政困难中减轻了部分负担。
    在清理仓库物资方面：本省遵照中央指示成立新疆清理仓库物资分会，各区县分设支会，截至现在为止，仅迪化市即查出未登记物资，最低估价约值人民币二十亿元。又前房产清查委员会清查各机关公有车马铺垫等约值人民币七亿二千余万元。
    ２、省人民政府成立后，恢复了贸易公司的组织。四个月中次第成立了阿克苏、喀什、焉耆三个分公司，改组并统一管理了伊、塔、阿三区的发展公司，成立了霍尔果斯，库尔勒两个办事处。贸易公司现正集中力量收购土产，准备完成土产出口的任务。
    ３、四个多月来，扩大春耕生产，成为我们主要任务，一切工作都围绕着这一运动展开。新省的人民解放军，今年计划开垦耕地六十万亩，以目前情况估计，不但完成计划，并且可能超过十五万亩。同时各区县的春耕工作，也都已普遍热烈的展开，特别是召开人民代表会的地区格外紧张。代表会把农民组织起来，发起了农村互助运动，调剂土地、籽种、耕牛、农具等。迪化区各县总计互借籽种一千三百零七石二斗四升，公借籽种一千二百五十石，互借耕牛三百六十一条，马四十四匹，调剂土地八百三十二亩，解决农具（铁铣）一百零九把，牧草三千六百斤，修理水渠共长十五公里。为配合这个大生产运动，农林厅派了四个随军工作队在沙湾、伊犁、焉耆、阿克苏等地工作。水利厅四个多月来协助军队和补修了六处渠道：（１）迪化完成和平渠长约十二公里的铺石片工作和该渠首段长约十七公里的局部整修工作，下四工长约十三公里的新渠和红雁池水库的放水渠，共可灌地三万六千亩。（２）沙湾太平新盛两渠之开渠道和拦河坝工程，已于四月底完成，约可灌地六万亩。（３）绥来整理了旧渠道，共灌地约两万亩。（４）小拐渠道和拦河坝工程正加紧赶修，可灌地二万亩。（５）焉耆、开都河南岸整理和扩充了五条渠道（大小巴伦渠、开来渠），北岸整修和改善了两条渠道（和硕滩渠包括斯坦渠），共灌地约六万余亩。（６）阿克苏整修了多浪渠、大汗渠及开挖支渠，在库车开挖渭干河的泉水沟新渠，共可灌地约三万亩。（７）伊犁方面动员军民十一万人，开掘与整修了一条长达九十七公里的皇渠，可灌地二十五万至三十万亩。总计七处约可灌地五十万亩。
    ４、畜牧业在新疆仅次于农业，解放以前伪建设厅虽有种畜场，农牧场等机构，但均等于虚设。牧畜数目近年来不但不能繁殖，而且死亡率极大。牧畜厅成立后，先进行了整顿机构的工作。接管迪化、伊犁、塔城三个种畜场，焉耆农牧场，库车、喀什两个种羊场，迪化、喀什等九区的兽疫防治站、伊犁区兽医院，迪化血清厂，并依畜牧兽医两方面目前实际情况，重新另行改组和增设迪、伊、塔、焉等四区畜牧总场，及阿山、喀什、库车等区县种羊场。在兽医方面，改组和增设迪、伊、塔、焉、喀等五区兽医院、阿山、阿克苏、和阗、莎车、哈密等五区兽医分院，吐鲁番、绥来等县十五个兽医防治站，木垒河、河南、霍城等二十六县兽疫防治分站。现已改组者有迪化、伊犁两区畜牧总场及兽医院，其他各县兽医畜牧机构暂仍以原机关推行业务。
    ５、新疆的工业极为落后，虽然过去有伪建设厅所属的迪化煤矿厂、铁工厂、硫酸厂、玻璃厂、地质调查所、金矿局等七个单位及和阗的织绸厂、独山子油矿、阿山金矿等，但都是有名无实，更谈不到以厂养厂。省人民政府成立之后，五个月集中力量进行整顿恢复和改造工作，建立工厂管理委员、职工会。如八道湾煤矿原计划每年可产煤十三万筐，需政府补贴二百七十万元，但经整顿后，每年计划可产煤二十万筐，只需政府贴补七十万元就可维持。其他如陶瓷厂、织绸厂，经整顿后，产量也渐提高，减少了政府大批的开支，目前虽离以厂养厂的目的还有相当距离，但正努力走向企业化的道路。
        三  文化教育工作
    １、关于教育的改进，本省目前教育改进工作，主要在整顿恢复改造各级学校，彻底废除国民党反动教育制度，订正课程内容，加强教职员思想改造。全疆各级公立学校虽有一千四百余所，但在学制上、设备上都不统一，而且窳腐陈旧，学生额数也不充足。在这一情况下，首先在迪化市作了有重点的整顿工作，然后再有计划有步骤的向外区、县逐步展开。迪化市教育改进工作，在整顿学校方面，曾进行合校，并班，充实学生名额的工作。在订正课程内容方面，对过去反共反人民的课本已经彻底取缔，最近即可全部解决中小学的各种政治历史国文课本，维哈文课本现正赶译中，不久即可获到解决。在教职员思想改造问题，除个别调动参加训练班，进行学习改造外，各级学校普遍成立了学委会，并定期举行座谈会进行学习。自五月初旬开始，省教育厅干部及本届师范毕业生拟合组十二个小组分头到迪化区各县做教育改革工作。
    ２、关于文化建设工作：（一）新闻事业：汉文新疆日报在去年十二月六日改组创刊后，即积极从事调整人员，充实内容，扩大发行。本年一月份共发行二十四万二千二百七十一份，二月份共二十四万四千四百四十一份，三月份共三十三万零六百四十一份，发行网已扩大到本省五十六个县份。维哈文新疆日报本年一月份发行三万零八百二十一份，二月份四万一千八百七十一份，三月份七万零二百九十五份。维文报的发行数所以少于汉文报的原因之一，是南疆各区、县在国民党反动派统治时期，曾受到阅读维文报的种种限制。此种恶果是需要长期努力才能克服的。以上两种全疆性报纸，自解放后迄今发行数字已增加一倍以上，其他各地方性报纸亦在改进中。新华社新疆分社记者十一人分驻迪、哈、绥来、伊、塔、阿等地，经常向西安及北京供写稿件。迪化人民广播电台每周播音一千二百六十分钟，每天三小时，节目内容分新闻、讲座、转播了娱乐数种。该台已计划设立外区县收音站八处，并拟购置较大电力广播机，使和阗等较远城市能够收听。（二）文娱工作：青年歌舞团在改组前为维吾尔剧团，曾吸收新进歌舞话剧人员扩大演出工作，在舞蹈艺术上，创造了新形式，现正从事以新民主主义为内容的剧本创作或改编工作。哈柯剧团，三月份曾演出“卡林玛尔”歌剧，并经常在广播电台播送音乐节目。（三）编译工作：维文书已译出并经三次修改与审核后付印的有人民政协文件、论人民民主专政、新民主主义论、毛泽东的人生观、中国革命与中国共产党五种，译出并已修改审核尚未付印的有毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话一种。译出尚未订正的有十九种。哈文书已译印的有人民政协文件及新民主主义论两种，已译未审的有毛泽东的人生观一种。总计译成维文书二五种三四五、二一八字，哈文书三种五六、六四○字，并订正其他文件四种。（四）出版部门：新华书店新疆总分店已开始营业，现在筹设迪化南疆分店并扩大业务，该店印刷厂承印书籍三种：政协文献五○○○份，中共党章五○○○份，迪化市各族各界代表会议汇刊六○○份，现已出齐，并已印行社会发展简史等书三种，共一万六千册。此外，对于迪化市及全省文学艺术方面指导推进工作及展开电影事业的准备工作，亦在了解情况和布置中。
            四、治安司法工作
    １、四个多月的治安工作，以肃清特务为主要任务，对正式管训的特务分子，正进行政治改造，组织其劳动生产。据现在统计全疆各地共登记特务分子将近一千一百人，缴获匪特电台四十九部，机枪三挺，长短枪枝一百八十余枝，子弹四千余发，电码一百四十本，电讯零件六百余件，炸药八箱。新省已基本上摧毁国民党在新疆的特务组织机构，但这并不等于就肃清了，要彻底肃清还必须作较长期的艰苦工作。其次，四个月来破获土匪、窃盗、贩毒等案件迪化有九十一起，在迪化收集散兵游勇无业游民三百余人，孚远四十人，托克逊七十人，在迪化市集训小偷扒手七十人，取缔与改造娼妓五十人，三月份并打击了反动帮会勾结土匪投奔乌斯满的活动。
    此外，关于改造旧警察与建立新公安部队方面，公安厅接收了原市警察局所开办的警干班，经过三个月的思想教育，一部分人分发各地工作，一部分留在市公安局工作。整顿了市公安局，把一些特务分子，极坏分子调去训练改造，补充了新的干部，使市公安局改成了一个新的机构。继之是把省公安大队，迪化公安队建立起来，并经过一番思想教育，改造成为人民公安部队。各县公安局大部已派解放军参加工作。同时，为解决干部缺乏问题，公安厅并招收二百五十余名学生（包括六个民族）开办公安学校，培养民族警察干部。
    ２、司法工作：四个月来把伪新疆高等法院改组为省人民法院，伪迪化地方法院改组为市人民法院，废除了反动的伪六法，以中央人民政协共同纲领和本省目前施政方针及人民政府各种法令决议等为处理案件的依据，停收一切诉讼状纸等费。四月份已开始依照新的编制建立新的机构与新的制度。在清理监犯方面，伊犁已完成，计清结二百四十二人，迪化已成立清理监犯委员会，正在进行清理，其他区县将要开展这一工作。
            乙  获得成绩的原因
    省人民政府成立至今四个多月，作了上述的一些工作，初步打下了人民民主政权的基础。所能获得这样成绩的原因，主要的约有以下几点：
    一、中央人民政府和西北军政委员会的正确领导。
    二、人民解放军的帮助：人民解放军进入新疆各地区后，不仅镇压反动、安定地方、巩固胜利，使各族各界人民对英勇的解放军亲若兄弟，并且在劳动生产的号召下，起了带头作用，掀起了无比的热潮。预定在全疆开垦荒地六十万亩，现可能超出十五万亩。为了配合生产，新挖及补修水渠共六道，计约可灌溉五十万亩。修建玛纳斯河大桥。该桥是由迪化经过伊犁通往苏联友邦的要道，因国民党匪帮企图阻止伊犁革命军前进而被焚毁的。解放军在零下三十度酷寒的气候中进行修建工程，全桥石墩木架，长二百四十八公尺，宽九公尺，高八公尺，载量二十五吨，两岸各有二百五十公尺防水堤一道，可保十年之久。以四个月时间完成了资产阶级工程师曾认为要三年才能修筑的伟大工程。由于解放军以勇敢苦干的精神，克服了一般以为不可克服的困难，给政权以很重要的帮助。
    三、人民的拥护：省人民政府依照共同纲领的精神所订的目前施政方针，由于政策的正确，宣传教育的深入，和各种群众团体的积极工作，得到人民一致的拥护。如筹粮和推销公债及迪化市的税收等工作，都在很短时间内胜利的完成任务。
    四、各级政权工作人员的努力：由于老干部的带头和对留用旧人员起了启发作用，使他们认清了立场，提高了工作效率，各部门的工作都有了自动性、积极性。全体工作人员一致的努力，也是获得成绩的原因之一。
            丙  缺点和原因
    在工作过程中，也发现了很多的缺点：
    一、工作发展不平衡：由于骨干干部太少，不够分配，所以择较为冲要地区，配备干部比较要强。有些地区，则干部配备要弱些。老干部较多的部门工作就生动积极，较少的就进步缓慢，形成了工作发展不平衡的现象。
    二、无组织无纪律的现象：我们纵的联系还不够，形成上下脱节，工作做了不报告，命令下去不回答的现象还有。如南疆有的专署未经省府批准随便更调县长，事后又不呈报。在横的方面，各部门亦未能很好联系起来，没有互通情报和交流经验，并有个别的单位沿用老的作风管而不理，各自为政。所以形成这些缺点的原因，主要是干部的政治理论素养和工作经验不足，政治理论书籍又未翻译出来，有些民族的干部学习也不方便。而领导上在布置工作后未能抓紧督促检查，组织实地巡视，是主要原因，如统一财经决定须以大力贯彻，并打通干部思想和严厉制止贪污，但在执行中领导上未能抓紧此一工作，并且在某些地方有放松的现象发生。
    三、新疆为一多民族的省份，语言文字不同，无论在口头上文字上都须经过翻译方能表情达意，彼此了解。而翻译人员缺乏（现有翻译人员，很多不够水平），乃是减低工作效率原因之一。现正计划成立翻译训练班，并拟号召各民族的干部，互相学习语文，以克服这一困难。
    这些缺点我们正在大力加以克服，相信在不久时期内，是可以克服的。
            丁  经验方面
    一、集中统一问题：根据人民政协共同纲领和本省施政方针的原则，在中央人民政府和西北军政委员会的领导下，一切工作要抓紧贯彻，得到的成绩就大，反之，不能抓紧贯彻，成绩就差。如新疆省财政经济委员会经常工作未能搞起，税收工作和财政制度建立的不够，就发生了漏税和某些部门胡乱开支的现象。
    二、善于运用批评与自我批评：对腐朽的机构要想改造如不能使用批评与自我批评的武器，就不能达到改造目的。同时看得更清楚，如果不把旧的改造，新的建立，想完成任务，是不可能的，所以想改造旧的建立新的就必须用批评与自我批评。
    三、民族政策：适可的正确的掌握共同纲领的民族政策，除了注意配备各民族干部外，更重要的是注意培养和提拔各民族干部。各民族干部在工作和学习中有成绩的应予以表扬，有缺点的应进行耐心的教育与说服。对他们的觉悟，予以耐心的等待。总之，要紧紧掌握着平等互助团结的原则。
            戊  今后工作
    依照彭德怀主席在西北军政委员会上所作的关于目前西北地区工作任务的报告，本省目前施政方针，并根据新疆实际情况，决定今后几个月做以下的几件工作。
    一、新疆广大群众尚未发动起来，土匪恶霸特务仍横行乡村，所以继续进行剿匪、肃特、反霸，仍是今后重要的工作。同时要建立和健全农会、牧会，设立劳动局，建立全疆性工会，及其他可能建立的群众团体。在秋收后，在条件成熟的地区，可试行减租，适当地减轻地主剥削。
    二、改造下层政权：充实下层干部，建立下层政权，继续指派一部分干部担任专员、县长或副专员、副县长，以改造下层政权，彻底摧毁反动保甲制度。各区未开过代表会议的要即速召开，已开过的应三个月召开一次。召开全省各族各界人民代表会议。在此次编制中准备达到紧缩编制，节省开支，重新评比干部，及建立应建立的机构，如劳动局、人民监察委员会、检察署等的目的。
    三、整编全疆税收：发展贸易，争取土产出口，增产粮食，特别是整顿工业机构准备与苏合办两公司，并建立严格供给制度，严禁浪费，继续检举贪污，以贯彻财政统一政策。
    四、继续举办行政人员训练班，轮训旧职员，吸收新干部，加强在职干部学习，以提高一般干部的政治水平，建立全心全意为人民服务的人生观。同时要加强对新疆学院及全疆中等学校，和各级行政人员训练班领导，以大量培养各民族的干部。新疆是多民族的地区，如不培养出大批的各个民族的干部，从事各部工作，工作是做不好的。
    五、本省解放后，伊犁、塔城、阿山等三个区和迪化、哈密、焉耆、阿克苏、喀什、和阗、莎车等七个区在政治经济上已渐趋统一，但由于过去长期的隔离，目前统一性还不够，政府干部的思想作风还不够一致，所以政府今后在干部中应加强统一领导的思想，并应确实执行请示报告制度，严格的组织检查督促，有效的展开批评与自我批评，才能做好工作。
            己  建议事项
    一、畜牧业在本省经济上仅次于农业，所以发展本省畜牧业确是当前重要工作之一。拟请仍保留本省现有之畜牧厅以加强领导，发展畜牧业。
    二、本省原设有水利厅，其主要任务，在于发展水利，配合农业生产。因水利与农业工作分离，就容易使工作脱节，为了统一领导，提高工作效能起见，拟将本省原设水利厅改为水利局，归农林厅领导。
    三、本省系一多民族地区，在省级各机关之干部配备上，都须照顾民族成份，尤其因语文隔阂，各机关均须设翻译人员，方能推行工作，因此在编制上得多占员额。此次政务院新颁编制人数，新疆按内地各省一般情况规定，似感数额不够，拟请酌加省级机构编制员额。
    四、本省各部门建设工作，正在分头开展，惟所需之各项专门技术人材，与有政治素养之带头干部极感缺乏，工作推动困难。为解决目前需要起见，请先由内地调派专门技术教授与带头干部一批来新，以展开工作。另方面，为提拔与造就本省各民族干部，拟在本省设立专门技术人员训练班，并选派优秀青年至苏联与内地各大学学习专门技术。这些问题，请予指示。
    五、本省已建立和正在建立各级人民法院，推进司法工作，但因还没有奉颁新的民刑法律，使处理案件没有依据，请迅速颁发有关律令。
