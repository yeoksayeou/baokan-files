　　After the Bathhouse Industry Labor-Management Consultation Meeting
    Difficulties Encountered in Implementing Resolutions After Representatives Failed to Explain to Employees
    [Our Newspaper] Following the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting in the Beijing Bathhouse Industry, difficulties have been encountered in implementing certain provisions of the first consultation because the explanations were insufficient. Various issues concerning the improvement of business, which were passed at the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting, such as providing soap for the convenience of customers and eliminating the bad habit of deducting tea money. Although these measures have had a positive effect on improving business, the representatives only notified the bathhouses to implement them after the meeting, failing to adequately explain and listen to the opinions of the members regarding the proposals. This resulted in some bathhouses, both labor and management, expressing dissatisfaction with the decisions of the meeting due to concerns about their own interests. For example, some employees did not understand the reason for providing soap, as they used to sell soap themselves, and believed that this deprived them of their profits. Regarding the issue of business hours, the consultation meeting rigidly stipulated that all bathhouses should open at 7:00 AM and close at 11:00 PM, without considering that the location of some bathhouses was not suitable for the above regulations, resulting in the failure to implement the resolution.

　　浴堂业劳资协商会议后
    代表未向职工解释执行决议遇到困难
    【本报讯】京市浴堂业劳资协商会议代表对第一次协商的某些规定因为解释不够，在贯彻执行中遇到了困难。劳资协商会议上通过的各项有关改进业务的问题：如添备肥皂便利顾客沐浴，取消克扣茶叶恶习。虽然这些措施对改进业务起着良好作用，但代表于会后只通知各浴堂实行，未能很好解释和听取会员对议案的意见，致使部分浴堂劳资双方因涉及本身利益，对会议的决定表示不满。如部分职工不明白添备肥皂的道理，而过去肥皂是他们代售的，认为这样是剥夺了他们的利益。关于营业时间问题，协商会议硬性规定一律上午七时开门，下午十一时落灯，但未顾及个别浴堂营业地点不适宜上述规定，致未能执行决议。
