Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: TASS, Vienna, 2nd: The Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party issued a statement on the Korean situation, stating that the US imperialists intend to use the war they organized in Korea to cover up their colonial robber war. The statement, after pointing out that the struggle for peace and the prohibition of atomic weapons is now more important than ever, calls on all Communists and friends of peace to concentrate their efforts to awaken people of all strata in Austria to participate in the struggle for peace, and sign the peace declaration to respond to the US military provocations.
    The Secretariat of the Free Austrian Youth League also issued a statement, paying tribute to the heroic Korean youth who are currently waging a resolute struggle for the unification and independence of their motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: TASS, Karachi, 1st: The Pakistani Communist Party issued an appeal to the people of Pakistan, criticizing the US government's armed intervention in Korean affairs.
    The appeal to the people emphasized that the resolution passed by the members of the United Nations Security Council at the meeting on June 27 was illegal.
    The appeal to the people stated: The purpose pursued by the Americans is very obvious, that is, to drown the democratic system and democratic forces of Korea in a sea of blood, to turn the whole of Korea into a colony of US imperialism, and finally to turn the whole of Korea into a military bridgehead for attacking the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and launching the Third World War currently being prepared by the British and American imperialists. President Truman's order to its navy to "protect" Taiwan has openly interfered in China's internal affairs, and thus committed a crime of aggression against the People's Republic of China.
    The Pakistani Communist Party appealed: Demand that all US military delegations, warships and air forces withdraw from Korea immediately; demand that US imperialism not interfere in Korean affairs at all; condemn the US imperialists and their puppets for implementing aggression against the democratic government and democratic forces of the Korean people; rise up to support the Korean democratic government and the Korean People's Liberation Army fighting for the freedom and unification of Korea; demand that the Pakistani representatives in the United Nations organization not collude with the American slave owners who enslave the Korean people and the instigators of the new British and American war. On the contrary, it should support the Korean people's struggle for the unification of Korea and the establishment of a free and democratic system, and demand the recognition of the representatives of the People's Republic of China as members of the Security Council.
    The appeal to the people ended with the following slogans: "Down with British and American imperialism! Do not lay a hand on Korea! Down with the American aggressors and warmongers! Long live the freedom and independence of the peoples of all Asian nations!"

　　不准对朝鲜动手！
    奥国及巴基斯坦共产党斥美帝对朝鲜武装干涉
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社维也纳二日讯：奥地利共产党中央委员会就朝鲜局势发表声明称美帝国主义者打算利用他们在朝鲜组织的战争，来掩盖他们的殖民强盗战争。声明在指出争取和平与禁止原子武器的斗争现在比以前更为重要后，号召所有的共产党员及和平友人集中他们的力量，唤醒奥国各阶层的人民参加争取和平的斗争，在和平宣言上签名，以答复美国的军事挑衅。
    自由奥地利青年联盟书记处亦发表声明，向目前正在为争取他们祖国的统一与独立而进行坚决斗争的英勇的朝鲜青年致敬。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩一日电：巴基斯坦共产党发表告巴基斯坦人民书，抨击美国政府武装干涉朝鲜事务。
    告人民书强调指出：联合国安理会的理事们在六月二十七日会议中所通过的决议是违法的。
    告人民书说：美国人所追求的目的是很明显的，那就是要使朝鲜的民主制度和民主势力淹死于血海中，使朝鲜全国沦为美帝国主义的殖民地，最后把朝鲜全国变成军事桥头堡垒，以便进攻苏联和中华人民共和国，发动英美帝国主义者们目前正在准备的第三次世界大战。杜鲁门总统命令它的海军“保护”台湾，已公开干涉中国的内政，因而对中华人民共和国犯了侵略的罪行。
    巴基斯坦共产党呼吁：要求美国一切军事代表团、军舰和空军一律退出朝鲜：要求美帝国主义完全不得干涉朝鲜事务；谴责美帝国主义者及其傀儡们，针对朝鲜人民的民主政府和民主势力而实行的侵略；起来支援朝鲜民主政府和为朝鲜的自由与统一而战的朝鲜人民解放军；要求在联合国组织中的巴基斯坦代表们，切勿与奴役朝鲜人民的美国奴隶主及英美新战争的煽动者们沆瀣一气。相反的，应支持朝鲜人民为朝鲜的统一和建立自由的民主制度而进行的斗争，要求承认中华人民共和国的代表任安理会的理事。
    告人民书用这样的口号来结束：“打倒英美帝国主义！不准对朝鲜动手！打倒美国侵略者和战争贩子！亚洲各民族人民的自由和独立万岁！”
