　　Protest Against American Aggression in Korea!
    Southeast Asian Progressives in Britain Hold Meetings to Welcome Stalin and Nehru's Suggestions
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 25th] TASS, London, July 23rd: The Southeast Asian Committee, composed of Southeast Asian progressives residing in Britain, held a meeting to protest against American aggression in Korea. At the meeting, Mr. Lin, the editor of the Malayan箴言报, said: The illegal discussions of the United Nations Security Council are being used by the United States to carry out international conspiracies. The aggression against Korea is a premeditated attack by the United States against all the people of Asia. The meeting decided to send representatives to attend the All-England Peace Conference and to convene a meeting of Southeast Asians residing in Britain in the near future.
    The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution stating: The attack on Korea is part of a treacherous imperialist expansion and conquest plan. This plan is full of great damage to the freedom of Asian nations and constitutes a direct threat to world peace. The resolution condemns the U.S. government for turning the United Nations into a docile tool for its hegemonic ambitions and war policies. The resolution stated: It is the primary responsibility of all Asian people to strive to defeat this imperialist conspiracy. Therefore, we welcome Nehru's initiative to seek a peaceful solution to the Far East conflict. We demand that the United Nations immediately and unequivocally accept the solution proposed in the exchange of letters between Stalin and Nehru, convene a Security Council meeting with representatives of the People's Republic of China present, and listen to the statements of representatives of the Korean people, thereby paving the way for a speedy solution to the Korean issue.
     Famous American Blacks Protest Against Aggression in Korea and Advocate for Chinese Representation in the United Nations
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 26th] TASS, New York, July 25th: The movement protesting against American aggression in Korea continues to unfold in the United States. On July 24th, representatives of the "African Affairs Committee" issued a statement to the press, signed by one hundred prominent black writers, educators, union leaders, and others, demanding that the United States stop interfering in Korea and stop suppressing the struggles of colonial people for national independence. Signatories include the famous historian Dr. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, the secretary of the "African Affairs Committee," Professor Charlie Hill of "Wilberforce University," and the chairman of the National Maritime Union, Dalance Smith, among others.
    The statement reads in part: "In the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for national self-determination, unilateral actions by the United States must give way to a general solution based on resolutions of a true United Nations organization, including the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The United States' refusal to recognize the legitimate government of China's entry into the United Nations has undermined the United Nations and made it a plaything of the United States. Allowing the true representatives of the Chinese people to participate in the United Nations, thereby resolving the current difficulties of the United Nations, is the primary and indispensable action towards resolving the Korean issue."
　　U.S. Government Staff Returning from South Korea Hope American Youth Will Not Sacrifice Their Lives for the Bosses
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 26th] TASS, New York: The Compass Daily published a conversation on July 24th between Irle, former chairman of the CIO Oregon State Council, and a radio reporter. Irle served as a labor advisor for the "Economic Cooperation Administration" in South Korea and recently returned from South Korea. Irle declared that South Korea's "Republic of Korea is not a democratic country... it is completely a police state, and the United States is responsible for this."
    The Workers Daily published an interview with Meade, a conservative Republican and former U.S. military railway transportation commander in Korea. He denounced the U.S. armed intervention in Korea, saying: The Korean people are fighting for their independence. The Korean people see no difference between us and Japan. We cannot win the Korean people to our side. The universal desire of the Korean people is for their country to be governed by Koreans.
    Meade expressed opposition to the U.S. armed intervention in Korea's internal affairs. He declared: "If the bosses want to go abroad to make money, they can do so, but if they want American youth to sacrifice their lives for their investments, that is the time to stop them."

　　抗议美国侵略朝鲜！
    侨英东南亚进步人士集会欢迎斯大林和尼赫鲁建议
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十三日讯：由侨居英国的东南亚进步人士所组成的东南亚委员会，集会抗议美国侵略朝鲜。在会上，马来亚箴言报主编林氏说：联合国安全理事会会议的非法讨论，就是让美国利用来进行国际阴谋。侵略朝鲜是美国预先谋划的对全亚洲人民的进攻。会议决定了派代表出席全英和平会议，并在最近召开侨居全英的东南亚人士的会议。
    会议一致通过决议称：对朝鲜的攻击是奸诈的帝国主义扩张和征服计划的一部分。这个计划充满着对亚洲民族自由的巨大损害，并构成对世界和平的直接威胁。决议斥责美国政府把联合国变成其称霸世界和推行战争政策的驯服工具。决议称：努力击败这帝国主义阴谋是全体亚洲人民的首要责任。因此，我们欢迎尼赫鲁企求和平解决远东冲突的倡议。我们要求：联合国机构应立刻毫不含糊地接受斯大林和尼赫鲁换文里所建议的解决方针，召开有中华人民共和国代表出席的安全理事会会议，听取朝鲜人民代表的申述，从而铺平迅速解决朝鲜问题的道路。
     美国黑人名流抗议侵略朝鲜主张使我国代表参加联合国
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：美国国内继续展开抗议美国侵略朝鲜的运动。七月二十四日，“非洲事务委员会”的代表向报界发表了一项由一百名著名的黑人作家、教育家、工会领袖等人签署的声明，要求美国停止干涉朝鲜以及美国停止镇压殖民地人民争取民族独立的斗争。签名者有著名的历史学家杜波依斯博士，保罗·罗伯逊，“非洲事务委员会”秘书、“威伯福士大学”教授查理·希尔，全国海员工会主席达朗士·史密斯等人。
    该声明略称：“在亚洲和非洲的人民为民族自决而进行的斗争中，美国的片面行动，必须让位给以包括苏联和中华人民共和国在内的真正联合国组织的决议为基础的总解决。美国拒绝承认中国合法政府加入联合国，因而破坏了联合国并使它成为美国的玩物。允许中国人民真正的代表参加联合国，借以化解联合国目前的困难，这是走向解决朝鲜问题的首要而且不可或缺的一个行动。”
　　自南朝鲜返美的美政府工作人员希望美国青年不为老板牺牲生命
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：指南针日报于七月二十四日刊载前产联奥勒冈州理事会主席伊尔在接见广播记者时发表的谈话。伊尔曾在南朝鲜任“经济合作总署”的劳工顾问，最近方自南朝鲜返国。伊尔宣称，南朝鲜的“大韩民国不是民主国家……它完全是一个警察国家，而美国要对这事负责”。
    工人日报发表前朝鲜美军铁路运输指挥、保守的共和党人米德的访问记。他斥责美国武装干涉朝鲜说：朝鲜人民正在为他们的独立而战。朝鲜人民看不出我们与日本有什么不同。我们不可能把朝鲜人民争取到我们这一边来。朝鲜人民的普遍愿望是要他们的国家由朝鲜人治理。
    米德表示反对美国武装干涉朝鲜内政，他宣称：“如果老板们希望到外国去赚钱，他们尽可以这样做，然而如果他们要美国青年为了他们的投资而牺牲生命，那就是阻止他们的时候了。”
