　　Mother of the Guerrillas
    Story Three from the South Korean Guerrilla Zone
    In Deoksi District, Imsil County, North Jeolla Province, a People's Guerrilla was scouting enemy positions at 11 p.m. when he was shot in the right leg by enemy fire and could no longer run. He crawled along a mountain gully, disoriented, and eventually crawled into a small thatched hut. An impoverished old woman lived in the small hut. The moment she saw the person crawling in, she knew he was a member of the People's Guerrilla. She immediately picked out a few pieces of cloth from her tattered sewing kit, cleaned the wounded guerrilla's wound, and bandaged it. The old woman had just finished this when she heard the footsteps of the pursuing puppet police approaching. She only had this one thatched hut, with no place to hide the guerrilla. Just as she was getting anxious, she heard a knock at the door. She immediately noticed the empty flour jar. She quickly helped the guerrilla into the flour jar, covered it with a wooden board, and then, undoing the buttons of her blouse, pretended to have just woken up and went to open the door. She knew that if a thorough search was conducted, both the guerrilla and herself would inevitably be killed.
    The door opened, and the puppet police asked her: "Who came to your house just now? Tell the truth, or we'll execute you as usual!"
    The old woman rubbed her eyes and said, "Look, I just woke up. If you don't believe me, search the house!"
    The puppet police, seeing that the old woman was nothing special, and afraid of wasting time and not catching up with the guerrilla, cursed a few times and continued their pursuit.

　　游击队的母亲
    朝鲜南部游击区故事之三
    在全罗北道的任实县德时区里，一个人民游击队于夜间十一点侦察敌情时，右腿中了敌人的子弹，跑不动了。他在山沟里，匍匐着爬行，不辨方向，终于他爬进了一个小草房中。小草房里住着一位穷苦的老太婆。她一看爬进来的人就知道是人民游击队，她立刻从破的缝衣包中拣出几块布，为受伤的游击队员擦干净伤口，包扎起来。老太婆刚刚做完这个，便听见跟踪追寻的伪警察们脚步声走近了。她只有这一间草屋，无处能掩蔽游击队员，正在着急的时候，敲门声响了，她一眼看到了空着的面缸，便立刻把游击队员扶着装进面缸里，一面盖上木板，一面解开胸前的纽扣，装着刚睡醒的样子走去开门。她知道，如果彻底搜查时，游击队员和她自己都免不了要被杀死的。
    门开了，伪警问她：“刚才谁到你房子里来了？要直说，不说实话，就照常例枪毙你！”
    老太婆一边揉眼一边说：“你看吧，我刚刚睡起来，不信，你就搜查吧！”
    伪警们看着这个老太婆没有什么，他们又怕耽误时间追不上游击队员，就骂了几句又往前追赶了。
