Shijingshan Power Plant
    Promotes a Large Number of Worker Cadres
    Zhou Tian
    Since Shijingshan Power Plant promoted Wang Wenbin to deputy director last December, 46 workers have been promoted to various technical and management positions such as foreman, shift leader, field director, and section chief. Nine technical personnel and staff members have been promoted to higher grades.
    Last December, Wang Wenbin was promoted to deputy director. Following the first session of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference, he was elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee. This was a great encouragement to the workers of the plant. The workers began to experience that the regime led by the working class was indeed different, and they felt that they had truly become masters of the country.
    In February of this year, a field system was implemented. Under the director, there are five fields: electrical field, steam turbine field, boiler field, repair field, and transportation field. Among the 13 directors and deputy directors, eight were promoted from the workers.
    Good news kept coming one after another. In addition to the continuous promotion of worker cadres, Liu Yingyuan, a nationally renowned labor hero, was transferred from the Northeast to serve as the director of the power plant in March.
    These facts were a great encouragement to the workers. A worker surnamed Zhang said, "Our deputy director is from a worker background, and now the director is also from a worker background. Everyone believes that this is the day when we workers truly come to the fore. The Communist Party has cultivated us and educated us, so we can truly be masters and manage the factory."
    A large number of promoted staff cadres have demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm and production initiative in their leadership positions. The transportation field used to be a relatively backward department. The position of foreman was controlled by some backward, even work-shirking, individuals. The workers' production initiative was suppressed. Now the director is promoted from the workers, and the two deputy directors are one worker and another newly transferred and promoted cadre. The coal and ash transportation foremen are also newly promoted. This has refreshed the work in the plant. Taking the ash transportation team as an example, the original foreman, Du Shuhua, was very backward and did not allow changes in work methods, fearing that increased work efficiency would mean more work. Since the implementation of the field system, Du was transferred away, and Fu Zhihong was transferred to be the foreman. He actively led the workers in production and learning, mobilized everyone to find ways to change the past two ash transportation routes to one, taking the shortcut and abandoning the long way. The various tasks of ash removal, loading, and transportation were closely integrated. As a result, the number of ash transportation workers was reduced from 73 before the implementation of the field system to the current 15, and work efficiency was greatly improved. The surplus young workers were transferred to other fields to learn technology, and the elderly workers were engaged in cleaning the coal yard and other work.
    Significant progress has also been made in the work of other fields. This not only educated the workers and made them believe that they can manage the factory well, but also educated some conservative staff members and gave them a further understanding of the workers' abilities.
    In the process of promoting advanced and capable employees to leadership positions, some incompetent people were dismissed from their original positions and appropriately handled, educated, and helped to transform. This encouraged the advanced and motivated the backward. For example, Zhang Yushan was the original foreman of the Class A team of the high-pressure furnace in the boiler field. Because he was ill, a deputy foreman was promoted. Zhang Yushan was relatively backward, relying on his seniority, and not active in his work. After he recovered from his illness, everyone was unwilling to have him return. Therefore, the administration transferred him to the long front night shift. Although he had the title of foreman, he was actually relieved of his foreman duties. Later, seeing that everyone in Class A was working very vigorously under the new leadership, he became angry and jealous. After the party branch secretary of the field talked to him, explaining the reasons for his transfer and telling him that as long as he was humble, corrected his shortcomings, and did a good job, he still had a future. After several conversations, as well as the education of the active work of other classes, and his participation in the second party training class in the factory, his class consciousness improved, and he began to transform, actively working, and was also rewarded. Therefore, he was transferred to Class C of the field to work as a foreman. Now he has a new view on this issue. He said: "Everything depends on whether you are making progress or not. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, you must make progress. Things can't be like they were before." "Now I like two things the most: one is criticism, and the other is self-criticism. These are very good."
    In this large-scale promotion of staff cadres in the factory, the first thing is that the Party has a clear understanding of promoting worker cadres. Under the ideological leadership of the Party, the administrative leadership also clarified this work. They believe that in order to establish work on a solid foundation, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of cadres from among the workers and promote them to leadership positions.
    However, in the specific implementation of cadre promotion, there is still struggle. For example, some comrades are unwilling to transfer a large number of good employees to the municipal party committee's cadre training class to study, let alone let more people go, fearing that it will affect the work. This is not from the perspective of long-term interests. After struggling with this kind of thinking, the facts have proved that it is correct to transfer good cadres to study.
    In the work of cadre promotion, a foundation was laid in two aspects. On the one hand, party training classes were opened within the Party, led by the general party branch secretary himself. From November 15th of last year to March of this year, two sessions were held. After several months of study, the ideology was generally improved. In addition, a large number of activists were selected and sent to the municipal party committee's cadre training class to study, 31 in the first session, 100 in the second session, and 83 in the third session. In this way, not only was a large number of backbones cultivated, but the Party was also greatly developed. When the general branch was established in December of last year, there were only 67 party members, but now it has grown to 183. At the same time, the Communist Youth League has also grown to 119 members. There are a total of 302 party and league members, accounting for 33.2% of the total number of 905 people. The prestige of the Party has been improved, and it has also connected with the masses, laying the foundation for promoting worker cadres. On the other hand, transferring a group of backward employees from the power plant to participate in studies or to other departments greatly suppressed the evil spirit and promoted the righteousness. Some comrades believe that this will cause anxiety among the workers. In fact, as long as the reason is made clear, the workers can be persuaded.

　　石景山发电厂
    大批提拔工人干部
    周天
    石景山发电厂自从去年十二月把王文斌提拔为副厂长以来，工人被提拔当领班、值长、场主任、科长等各种技术和管理干部的已有四十六人；技术人员、职员被提拔升级的已有九人。
    去年十二月，王文斌被提拔为副厂长，跟着北京市第二届第一次各界人民代表会开会，他又被选为北京市人民政府委员会的委员，这给该厂的工人是一个很大的鼓舞。工人们开始体验到工人阶级领导的政权，确实不同了，他们感到自己确实当了国家的主人。
    今年二月间，实行了分场制，厂长之下共设电气场、汽机场、锅炉场、修理场、运输场等五场，正副主任共十三人，从工人中提拔了八人充任。
    喜事真是层出不穷，除了接连不断地提拔工人干部外，三月间又从东北调来了全国驰名的劳动英雄刘英源当发电厂的厂长。
    这些事实，对工人的鼓励是极大的。有一位姓张的工人说：“我们的副厂长就是工人出身，这回正厂长还是工人出身，大家都认为这是我们工人真正出头的日子了。共产党培养了我们，教育了我们，所以我们才真正能做主人，管理工厂。”
    大批被提拔的职工干部，在领导岗位上发挥了高度的工作热情与生产积极性。运输场过去是比较落后的部门。领班的地位被一些落后的、甚至是怠工的家伙所把持。工人的生产积极性受压制。现在正主任是由工人中提拔的，两位副主任，一个是工人，另一个是刚调来新提拔的干部。运煤、运灰领班，也是新提拔的。这就使得该厂的工作面貌为之一新。以该厂运灰班为例，原领班杜树华很落后，不准改变工作方法，怕工作效率提高了多干活。自实行分场制，杜被调走了，傅志洪调来作领班。他积极地领导工人生产、学习，发动大家想办法，把过去的两条运灰道，改为一条，走近道，舍远道。掏灰、装灰、运灰各项工作顺序紧密结合。结果，由分场制实行以前用运灰工人七十三人，减到目前十五人就够用了，工作效率大大提高。多余的人，青工调到别的场去学习技术，老年工人作清理煤厂等工作。
    其他场的工作，也都同样有显著的进步。这不仅教育了工人，相信自己能够管好工厂，同时也教育了一部分保守的职员，使他们对工人的能力有了进一步的认识。
    在提拔先进的、有能力的职工到领导岗位的过程中，曾把原有的一部分不称职的人撤了职，适当处理，教育帮助他们转变。这就鼓励了先进的，带动了落后的。例如锅炉场高压炉的甲班，原领班是张玉山，因为有病，又提拔了一个代理领班。张玉山较落后，摆老资格，工作不积极，病好后，大伙都不愿他回去。于是行政上把他调到长前夜，虽有领班的名义，实际上是免去了领班的职务。后来看到甲班在新领导下，大家干活非常起劲，他又生气，又忌妒。经过该场党分支书与他谈话，向他说明他被调的原因，并告诉他只要能虚心，改正自己的缺点，把工作搞好，还是有前途。经过多次谈话，同时其他各班工作积极的事实的教育，以及他参加了厂内的第二期党训班，阶级觉悟提高后，他开始转变了，工作积极起来，还受到了奖励。于是，又把他调到该场丙班去作领班。现在他对这个问题已有了新的看法。他说：“一切就看你进步不进步，共产党领导，你就必须进步，像先前那样就不行。”“现在我最喜欢两样：一个是批评，一个是检讨，这非常好。”
    在该厂这次大批提拔职工干部的工作中，首先是党对于提拔工人干部有明确的认识。在党的思想领导下，行政领导对这个工作也明确了。他们认为要想把工作建立在巩固的基础上，就必须在工人中培养大批的干部，提拔到领导岗位上来。
    但是，在具体执行提拔干部的时候，仍是有斗争的。例如，抽调大批好的职工到市委干训班去学习，有些同志就不愿意把好的干部抽去，更不让较多的人去，恐怕影响工作。这都不是从长远利益出发的。经过与这种思想的斗争，事实证明，抽调好干部去学习是正确的。
    在提拔干部工作中，同时也在两方面奠定了基础。一方面，在党内开党训班，由党总支书亲自领导，从去年十一月十五号起，到今年三月间止，办了两期。经过好几个月的学习，思想普遍提高了一步。此外，又挑选大批积极分子送到市委干训班学习，第一次三十一人，第二次一百人，第三次八十三人。这样，不仅培养了大批骨干，也大大的发展了党。去年十二月总支成立时，才有六十七个党员，现在已发展到了一百八十三人。同时，青年团也发展到了一百十九人。党、团员共有三百零二人，占全体总人数九百零五人的百分之三三·二强。党的威信提高，也联系了群众，并为提拔工人干部打下了基础。另一方面，把一批落后的职工从发电厂调去参加学习或调到其他部门去，大大地压低了邪气，发扬了正气。有些同志认为这会造成工人的不安，实际上，只要把道理说明白，工人是可以说服的。
