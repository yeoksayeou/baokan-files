　　Restoration of the Huai River and Mingguang Bridges on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line
    Minister Teng Daiyuan Attends Completion Ceremony and Congratulates Workers
    Ten Major Contributors Awarded Medals, Nearly One Hundred Contributors Receive Material Rewards
    [Our Newspaper, Bengbu News] (Reporter Chen Ji): The Huai River and Mingguang railway bridges on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line have been officially restored. The completion ceremony for the two bridges was grandly held on the south bank of the Huai River on July 11th. Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways attended in person. Deputy Director Li Yunhe of the Anhui North Administrative Office and representatives from the Bengbu Municipal People's Government also attended to offer congratulations.

    The Jinan Railway Bureau formed a bridge engineering office of more than 1,000 people last November to begin the restoration of the two bridges. After seven or eight months of arduous struggle by the employees, the Mingguang Bridge was completed on June 25th this year, and the Huai River Bridge was completed on July 7th.

    During the restoration process, the Huai River experienced two unprecedented floods in the past twenty years. The employees demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and fought the floods day and night. They jumped into the cold floodwaters, fourteen meters deep, to salvage bridge parts and clear piers. In the face of difficult material conditions, the workers created many tools to solve many problems in the project. For example, when the workers of the Mingguang Bridge were excavating the foundation of the No. 2 pier, they made a dredging machine. Riveter Song Shikui made a substitute vise out of angle iron. The workers of the Huai River Bridge repaired a steam winch on the construction site; oiler Yang Chunyuan invented fish oil for painting bridges, overcoming the difficulty of not being able to buy fish oil. During the construction of the two bridges, production competitions were launched many times, so that the work efficiency constantly broke through the old standards. For example, the oilers of the Huai River Bridge, who painted steel beams, increased from 20 square meters per worker per day to 80 square meters. The third team transported flagstones, in the past, eighty people used three flat cars, and at most transported fifty cars per day, now only fifty people, using four flat cars, can transport 148 cars per day. The riveters even created a national record of 1,016 rivets per furnace per day. Workers and engineers worked hard, studied together, and learned from each other, inventing new methods such as "using a bridge to lift a bridge," "aerial material matching," and "floating needle stringing," overcoming many engineering technical difficulties. Engineering personnel from the Ministry of Railways and Soviet experts repeatedly came to the site to help with the work, which gave the employees great inspiration and guidance in technology, and also made the employees more deeply aware that: "We must learn from the Soviet Union."

    The Huai River Railway Bridge is 574 meters long, and the Mingguang Bridge is 370 meters long. Both bridges were bombed and destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits. When the bridge was being repaired in March this year, American-made bandit planes came to bomb again, killing worker Wang Huanlun. This crime further aroused the workers' indignation. They responded to the atrocities of the American-made bandit planes with active work. Workers Liu Jifa and Xuan Hengtai gloriously sacrificed their lives because of their selfless work. In order to mourn the dead and record the process of bridge repair, the Jinan Bureau specially erected a "Huai River Railway Bridge Completion Memorial碑" at the east end of the Huai River Bridge.

    Minister Teng Daiyuan presented wreaths to the fallen martyrs. People from all walks of life in Bengbu also came to offer flowers.

    At the completion ceremony, Minister Teng Daiyuan personally cut the ribbon at the Huai River Railway Bridge; a locomotive pulled seven trains across the Huai River Railway Bridge. The people on both sides of the Huai River cheered. At the completion ceremony, Minister Teng Daiyuan, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, congratulated all the bridge repair workers, pointing out that the restoration of the Huai River Railway Bridge is conducive to national economic construction and the prosperity of the people's lives. He also called on all employees to pay attention to protecting the two bridges and preventing sabotage by special agents. After the meeting, an award ceremony was held, and Minister Teng Daiyuan personally pinned ten medals on the chests of the ten major contributors one by one. Twenty-three second-class contributors and seventy-three third-class contributors also received material rewards. The contributors said: "We will never be proud, we must add merit to merit and strive to learn technology." The Anhui North and Bengbu Municipal People's Governments and the broad masses of the people also congratulated the bridge repair workers, praising this great victory.

　　津浦线淮河明光两大桥修复
    滕代远部长出席落成典礼向工人致贺
    十位大功臣获得奖章近百名功臣得到物质奖励
    【本报蚌埠讯】记者陈迹报道：津浦线上的淮河、明光两大铁桥正式修复；两桥的落成典礼于七月十一日在淮河南岸隆重举行。铁道部滕代远部长亲临参加。皖北行署李云鹤副主任及蚌埠市人民政府代表都前往致贺。
    济南铁路局于去年十一月组成一千余人的桥梁工程处，开始修复两桥。经过员工们七、八个月的艰苦奋斗，明光桥于今年六月二十五日完工，淮河桥于七月七日完工。
    在修复过程中，淮河发生了二十年来所未有的两次大洪水，员工们发挥了高度的积极性，日夜不断地与洪水搏斗着。他们跳进十四公尺深的寒冷的洪水中，打捞桥梁，清理桥墩。在物质条件困难的情况下，工人们并创造了不少的工具，解决了工程中的不少困难。如明光桥工人进行二号墩的挖基工作时，制出了一个挖泥机；铆工宋世奎用角铁制成代用老虎钳。淮河桥的工人在工地里修理了一座蒸汽绞车；油工杨春元发明了油漆桥梁用的鱼油，克服了鱼油买不着的困难。两桥工人在修建工作中，曾多次发动生产竞赛，使工作效率不断地突破旧的标准。比如：淮河桥油工油漆钢梁，从每天每工二十平方公尺，提高到八十平方公尺；三中队运片石，在过去八十人用三辆平车，每日最多运到五十车，现在只有五十个人，用四辆平车，每天能运达一百四十八车。铆工组的工人更创造每天每盘炉铆钉一千零十六个的全国最高纪录。工人和工程师们由于努力工作，共同研究，互相学习，发明了“以桥吊桥”、“空中对料”、“浮标串针”等新的方法，克服了许多工程技术中的困难。铁道部工程人员和苏联专家一再到现场帮助工作，使员工们在技术上得到很大的启示和指导，同时也使员工们更深刻地体会到：“必须向苏联学习”。
    淮河铁桥长达五百七十四公尺，明光桥长达三百七十公尺。两桥都曾被国民党匪帮所炸毁。今年三月修桥时，美制匪机又曾来此轰炸，炸死了工人王焕伦。这一罪行，更激起工人们的愤慨。他们以积极工作回答了美制匪机的暴行。工人刘际发与宣恒太由于工作奋不顾身，光荣牺牲。为了悼念死者，记述修桥的经过，济南局特在淮河桥的东头建立了一块“淮河大铁桥落成纪念碑”。
    滕代远部长曾向死难烈士献花圈。蚌埠市各界人民也纷往献花。
    在举行落成典礼时，滕代远部长亲至淮河铁桥剪彩；机车拖着七辆列车，驶过淮河铁桥。淮河两岸人民欢呼不已。在落成典礼中，滕代远部长代表铁道部向全体修桥工人致贺，指出淮河大铁桥的修复，有利于国家经济建设及人民生活的繁荣。并号召全体员工注意保护两桥，防止特务破坏。会后举行授奖大会，滕部长将十枚奖章，替十位大功臣一一佩戴在胸前。二十三位二等功臣和七十三位三等功臣也都得到了物质的奖励。功臣们说：“我们决不骄傲，还得功上加功，努力学习技术。”皖北和蚌埠市人民政府和广大人民也都向修桥工人致贺，赞扬这一伟大的胜利。
