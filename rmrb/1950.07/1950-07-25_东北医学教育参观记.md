A Northeast travel and study group of twenty-odd medical workers from inside the customs (关内, i.e., the rest of China excluding the Northeast) was formed to investigate specialized medical education and visual teaching methods in the Northeast, and also took the opportunity to study health administration in the Northeast.

A score of experts and professors conducted thorough and individual investigations based on their own experience. This is undoubtedly a meaningful undertaking.

Specialized Education

Under the capitalist commodity medical education and the past semi-colonial transplant teaching methods, academic years (prolonged time) seemed to be the only factor determining academic achievement. Some schools were most complacent about their long duration, requiring seven, eight, or even nine or ten years to be considered "formal"; secondly, "erudition" was also a major requirement. Medical students, excluding pre-medical subjects, had no fewer than fifteen or sixteen specialized subjects. Each subject had thousands of pages of thick foreign-language textbooks. However, many people, after studying to the end, still became "generalists" who could not solve any problems. After graduation, they had to start all over again, working alone to delve into specialized fields for another three to five years to become a specialized doctor needed by society.

The specialized education in the Northeast is aimed at these shortcomings, and it is a new teaching method created from years of exploration and progress. This is a new education method of the Chinese people themselves. Its sole purpose is to be able to solve problems, reduce waste, and have a large number of students graduate in a short period of time, while ensuring that each graduate has the ability to solve problems. This is a problem that the medical education of various capitalist countries in the past could not solve. Those of us who have run medical education have been pursuing this ideal for decades. When we heard about this specialized education after liberation, we were very excited. However, those who emphasize so-called medical "orthodoxy" greatly disagreed. Therefore, in the past year from last year to now, the opinions heard in various places inside the customs can be summarized as follows:

"Medical subjects have close interconnections, so it is not suitable to divide them into specialties."

"Specialized medical education is right, but it is not appropriate to specialize too early."

"Specialized education is akin to shoddy production, only suitable for teaching crash courses, and not suitable for formal medicine."

"Although specialized education can solve the problem of quantity, there is a risk of reducing quality."

"Specialized education shortens the duration of study and cannot cultivate highly talented individuals who can think and critique."

"Specialized education can only cultivate purely technical medical practitioners, and cannot cultivate teachers."

In order to solve these problems, we who came to the Northeast to study first focused on specialized education. Wang Bin, the president of Northeast Medical University, told us: "Specialized education" did not fall from the sky, nor was it fabricated out of thin air. As early as 1946, when China Medical University moved to the Northeast, it proposed specialized and refined key education; in October 1947, specialized education was proposed. At that time, the war in the Northeast was tense, and the medical university's talent, equipment, teaching environment, living environment, and all conditions were extremely unfavorable. However, in order to adapt to objective needs, to carry out medical revolution, and to oppose traditional dogmatism and empiricism, this new method was resolutely put forward in a difficult environment. Sure enough, it played a great role in a short period of time. Trainees who graduated in eight months or one year generally were able to undertake certain work and solve the urgent need for medical personnel at that time. In addition, in the reports of various leaders and in our conversations with various professors, they were able to cite many concrete facts to prove that the trainees trained by the specialized education method in the past played a significant role in their work. Specialized education can indeed improve medical quality together.

Next, we conducted in-depth investigations in various colleges in the Northeast.

We have visited the basic colleges. We participated in student examinations in the Department of Bacteriology; we participated in lectures and group discussions in the Departments of Pathology, Physiology, and Anatomy; we made systematic observations in terms of work in the Departments of Internal Medicine, Surgery, and various departments and wards. For example, whenever the visiting group arrived at a department, the members first rushed to the medical record room, each grabbing one or several medical records to repeatedly study in detail. Sometimes, when they encountered assistant physicians or intern trainees examining patients, they closely watched the movements, records, questions and answers, observed his examination, his diagnosis, and his treatment, and most also made individual inquiries. The final comment was always a brief: "Not bad." These two words "not bad," spoken by experts, show that specialized education can indeed solve problems.

The student examinations we participated in were all operational experiments and oral examinations. The students were so proficient in their operations and so clear in their answers, which were rarely seen in medical schools in the past. But they were all two-year students, and now they have just finished the examination of the first year of basic courses. Here, we can see the achievements of specialized education.

When we were listening to lectures, the lectures in each class were given by lecturers, teaching assistants, or assistants. Each of them was very young, but when they lectured, they were organized, concise, clear in reasoning, and calm in attitude. Every pronunciation and every movement could grab the students' attention. Many very difficult and complex academic theories can be expressed in extremely simple and clear words or gestures, so that everyone who listens is satisfied. It's like everyone is a teacher and a veteran scholar, and many teachers and veteran scholars inside the customs cannot achieve such a level. We learned that these young lecturers and teaching assistants were mostly trained in the past two-year or one-year system. The fact that they can have such achievements shows that specialized education is also the best way to increase teacher training.

When we were listening to pathology lectures, although the lectures were about pathological anatomy specimens and microscopic examination of pathological sections, we also talked about internal medicine cases, bacterial infections, and epidemiology at the same time. Every aspect of prevention and treatment was clear and outstanding. The students were also fully aware of every topic and every example, and thoroughly understood them. It can be seen that specialized education is not isolated, but specialized and refined, and there are close connections between various subjects.

When we were listening to lectures in each class, we participated in group discussions and personally saw the students discussing the lectures and raising questions, all showing that they had a high degree of sensitivity and full thinking ability. Also, when participating in oral examinations, we saw that the questions and criticisms raised by the students on the answers were generally accurate and unwavering. The oral examination of the Medical University is also a democratic method. When one person takes the exam, the other five or six people are equal to proctors, and they can all speak to criticize and supplement opinions. From this aspect, we can also see their cultivation. How could past medical education have such achievements? This shows the power of specialized education.

Visual Teaching

The second issue we focused on was the visual teaching method. We have also heard many people inside the customs raise questions about this: using images to illustrate profound theories, and using some crudely made charts and diagrams to teach students, like street cartoons that trick children, that is simply an insult to medicine!

However, this time in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun, we saw the richness and exquisiteness of visual teaching materials. The teaching material sections or teaching material museums of various schools have a large number of specialized technicians who are carefully producing them. The various types of specimens and models they made are as wonderful and moving as stage scenery. All the models that could be bought in medical schools in the past are available, and the models that have not been mentioned in the past are constantly being created. For example, the sound of the heart can be broadcast through a loudspeaker, and in a large lecture hall, one person's heartbeat can be heard by thousands of people at the same time. For example, the chemical changes between nerves and muscles can be indicated by electric current. Other models such as valve movement models, eye muscle movement models, and all kinds of health activity models are all magnificent and exquisite. The models owned by each school are several times better than all the models a scientific instrument museum possesses, which made all the visiting comrades marvel. Furthermore, seeing that they have bought more than a dozen film projectors and hired a large number of film production talents in Shanghai to come to the Northeast to participate in visual teaching work, we feel even more envious. Only then did we understand that the visual teaching method is not just comic strips.

According to professors from various schools, they did not have such rich teaching tools in the past, but the spirit of visual teaching has long been established. The spirit of visual teaching is to create a teaching environment so that listening, seeing, and doing can proceed sequentially and simultaneously within a certain period of time. Moreover, the form is vivid, the order is clear, and the impression is deep. In addition to doing it yourself, each student can thoroughly understand and never forget. To achieve this, there must be planned, organized, artistic, and creative collective discussions before teaching. All the teachers are mobilized, concentrating their minds, without the slightest懈懈, and repeatedly criticized and improved to create these methods. These methods are all achievable by everyone; but this spirit of serving the students wholeheartedly is not achievable by everyone.

In this test of visual teaching methods, the only comment is that the educators in the Northeast are creative.

Comrades all said that visual teaching methods should be immediately promoted inside the customs. Comrades also suggested that the Ministry of Health should uniformly expand the teaching material museums of various universities in the Northeast and process and manufacture teaching aids so that various schools inside the customs can purchase them in time. Comrades also suggested that various schools inside the customs should rotate specialized professors to lead teaching assistants to the outside of the customs for several months or a year of on-site practice of visual teaching methods. Comrades also said that visual teaching methods are necessary for all teaching, not only for medical students, but also urgently needed by other subjects and middle schools; not only needed for teaching low-level students, but also needed for teaching high-level students; not only needed for teaching one-year and two-year systems, but also needed for teaching five-year systems.

Collective Learning

In addition, there is also a question: "Is collective learning good, or is individual self-study good?" In various schools inside the customs, dogmatism and egalitarianism still prevail. Many people still carry the burden of reading dead books with their backs to the light, and they think that collective learning will hinder self-study. They all believe that only political classes can be collectively learned, and that profound theoretical courses like medical subjects cannot be applied to collective learning. However, the group learning in the form of "arrowhead groups" in various schools in the Northeast has become a sharp tool for further study.

In the classroom, the teacher stops lecturing after 20 minutes and the arrowhead groups discuss with each other for five minutes, raise questions, and the teacher or teaching assistant answers them. We personally saw that the discussions in each group were in-depth and insightful, and the questions raised were also very pertinent. After five minutes of discussion, the order is restored. After listening to another ten minutes of lecture, the group visits the physical objects, and the arrowhead groups also cooperate and help each other. After about fifteen minutes of brief discussion of the questions, a break is announced. After a ten-minute break, they enter the classroom for group operation, and the arrowhead groups always help each other, so the students digest each lesson at that time, without any doubts, so everyone is full of energy and in a good mood. I heard a professor tell us that this collective learning method is also applicable to professors. Professors have teaching discussion meetings, which are also collective research and group discussions. They usually listen to each other's lectures and criticize each other. Therefore, those who teach in the Medical University cannot help but work hard to improve. From this, it can be seen that collective learning, as long as it is used well, is of great help to teaching.

Another new method is to abolish the percentage grading system that has always been used in examinations, and instead use a five-level grading system. Five points are considered a superior grade, that is, those who can have insights beyond what the teacher has taught, and have other inventions, or find new materials in extracurricular reference books are given five points. This avoids formalistic scoring and can better exert the enthusiasm of the students. In the several examinations we participated in, we saw that there were not a few students who received five points.

In summary, the specialized education and visual teaching methods in the Northeast have been tested. The reason why they can achieve such excellent results is due to correct leadership and correct execution. The reason why they can be correct is because the teachers and students have only one goal, which is to "serve the people wholeheartedly."

　　东北医学教育参观记
    黄胜白
    关内一部分医学工作者发起了一个二十余人的东北旅行参观团，考察了东北的医学专科教育和形象教学，顺带还去考察了东北的卫生行政。
    一二十位专家、教授们，本着每个人的经验，到处作了深入的、个别的考察。这无疑的是一个有意义的工作。
    专科教育
    在资本的商品医学教育下以及过去的半殖民地的搬运教法下，学年（时间延长）似乎是唯一决定学业成绩的因素。某些学校最自满的就是年限长，七年八年乃至九年十年才配称“正规”；其次则“渊博”亦为主要条件。学医的人们除预科的科目不计外，本门的科目不下十五六种。每种都有上千页或几千页大厚本的外国文教科书。可是许多人学到最后毕业时，还是一个不能解决任何问题的“通才”。在毕业后还要从新起头，由个人单枪匹马再钻入专科去进修个三年五载，才能成为一个社会所需要的专科医生。
    东北的专科教育正是针对着这种缺点，从多年摸索前进中创造出来的新的教学方法。这是中国人自己的新教育法。他的唯一目的就是要能解决问题，要减少浪费，并且要短期内有大量学生毕业，还要每个毕业生都有能解决问题的能力。这是过去各资本主义国家医科教育所不能解决的问题。在我们曾办过医学教育的人，对于这个理想的追求已有几十年了。当解放后听到这种专科教育时，非常欢欣鼓舞。可是，讲究所谓医学“正统”的人，却大大不以为然。因此自去年到现在这一年中，在关内各地听到议论，归纳起来不外是：
    “医学各科有互相密切的连系，不宜于分科。”
    “医学专科教育是对的，但分科不宜太早。”
    “专科教育近乎粗制滥造，只合于教速成班，而不宜于正规医学。”
    “专科教育虽能解决量的问题，而有减低质量的危险。”
    “专科教育缩短年限，不能造就能思考能批判的高才。”
    “专科教育仅能造就纯技术的医士，而不能造就师资。”
    为了解决这些问题，我们到东北学习的人首先注视到了专科教育。东北医大王斌校长告诉我们：“专科教育”不是天上掉下来，也不是凭空杜撰出来的。从一九四六年中国医大迁到东北就提出专而精的重点教育；一九四七年十月才提出专科教育。那时，东北战争紧张，医大的人材设备，教学环境，生活环境以及一切条件都极端不利。但因为要适应客观需要，要执行医学革命，要反对传统的平均主义教条主义和经验主义。因此毅然在艰苦环境中提出这个新办法。果然在短时期中就发挥很大效用。八个月毕业的，一年毕业的学员，一般地都能担负一定的工作，解决当时迫切需要医务人材的问题。此外，在各个首长报告以及我们与各教授交谈中，他们都能举出许多具体事实，证明过去用专科教育法造就的学员们在工作中起了重大的作用。专科教育确能将医学质量一并提高。
    接着，我们就在东北各学院作了深入的考察。
    我们曾看过基础学院。在细菌系参加学生考试；在病理系、生理系、解剖系都参加了听讲，参加了小组讨论；在内科学院、外科学院以及各院系各病房，都在工作方面作有系统的观察。比如参观团每到一系，团员们首先奔病历室，每人抓住一份或几份病历反复细看，细密研究。有时正遇到助手医师或实习学员们在检查病人，就紧挨着察看动作、记录、问答，看他检查，看他诊断，看他处理，多数还作了个别的询问。最后都是一个短评：“不错”。这“不错”两个字，出自专家之口，就是说明专科教育确能解决问题。
    我们参加的学员考试，都是操作试验及口试。学生们操作的那样熟练，应答的那样明白，都是从前在医学校所少见的。可是他们都是二年制学生，现在才结束一年基础课程的考试。这里，可以看出专科教育的成绩。
    我们在听讲时，各班讲课都由讲师、助教或助手执行。他们个个都是年纪很轻，可是讲起课来有条不紊，要言不繁，理路清楚、态度安详，每一发音每一动作都能抓着学员的注意力。有好些很艰深很复杂的学理，都能用极浅显极明白的词句或姿式表现出来，使听的人无不心满意足。简直个个都像似老师宿学，而且关内正有许多老师宿学都做不到如此地步。我们知道了这些青年讲师助教们，多半是过去二年制或一年制造就出来的。他们能有如此成就，可见专科教育也是增养师资的最好的方法。
    我们在听病理讲课时，讲的虽是病理解剖标本，病理切片镜检，可是同时讲到内科病例，讲到细菌传染，讲到流行病学。讲到预防，讲到治疗处理，无一不头头是道，出色当行。学员们也是对每一课题，每一示例全盘通明，彻底了解。可见专科教育不是孤立，而是专精，各科之间都是有密切连系的。
    我们在各班听讲时，参加了小组讨论，亲见各学员讨论讲课提出问题，都表现出他们有高度敏感及充分思考能力。又在参加口试时见各学员对于答案所提出的质问与批判，一般都精确不移。医大口试也是民主方式，一人应考，其余五六人都等于监试，都可以发言批判，补充意见。从这方面也可看到他们的素养。过去的医学教育何能有此成就？这就表现出专科教育的力量。
    形象教学
    我们第二个注视的问题便是形象教学法了。这在关内也听到过许多人提出的疑问：将高深的理论用形象来表明，画些粗制滥造的图表来教学生，像是街头骗孩子的连环画，那简直是侮辱医学！
    可是我们此次在沈阳、在哈尔滨、在长春都看到形象教材的丰富精美。各校的教材科或教材馆都有大量的专门技师在精心制作。他们所制成的各形各式标本模型，都是像舞台布景似的精彩动人。过去医校所可买到的模型无一不有，过去所未经提到的模型也不断的在创制。譬如心脏的声音能用扩音机广播，在大讲堂上一人心跳，可使千人同时听到。譬如神经肌肉间的化学变化，可用电流指示。他如瓣膜运动模型，眼肌运动模型，一切卫生活动模型，伟大的精美的不一而足。每一学校所有的模型都胜过一个科学仪器馆所有的数倍，使得所有参观的同志都惊叹不置。更看到他们已买了十几架电影放映机，又在上海聘请了大批摄制电影人材来东北参加形象教学法工作，更觉歆羡不置。这才明白形象教学法不仅是连环图画了。
    据各校教授谈，过去他们并没有如此丰富的教学工具，但形象教学精神则久已建立。形象教学法的精神，是制造教学环境，使听、看、做在一个时间内依序并进。而且形态生动，次序分明，印象深刻，再加上亲手去做，所以每个学员都能彻底了解，永不能忘。要作到这点，在施教以前就要有计划的有组织的有艺术的有创造的集体讨论。教师们全部动员，聚精会神，一丝不懈，屡经批判改良，才能造成的这些方法。这些方法都是人人可做到的；可是这种全心为学员服务的精神，却非人人可及。
    在这次形象教学法的考验中，唯一的批语是东北的教导者富于创造性。
    同人们都说形象教学法应当立刻推行于关内。同人们又提议建议卫生部将东北各大学教材馆统一扩充，加工制造教具，俾关内各校得及时采购。同人们又建议关内各校应轮派专科教授率领助教来关外作数月或一年的形象教学法实地练习。同人们又说形象教学法是一切教学所必需，不独学医的需要，其他各科及中学也迫切需要；不独教程度低的需要，即教程度高的也需要；不独教一年制、二年制的需要，即教五年制的也一样需要。
    集体学习
    此外还有一个问题是，“集体学习好，还是个人自习好？”在关内各校因为教条主义、平均主义仍占上风。许多人还背着光读死书的大包袱，他们嫌集体学习会妨碍自修。他们都认为只有政治课可以集体学习，而高深的理论课程像医学各科是不能应用集体学习的。可是，东北各校以“箭头小组”形式的分组学习，成为了进修的一种利器。
    在课堂上，教师讲课二十分钟随时停止，由箭头小组相互讨论五分钟，提出问题，由教师或助教解答。我们亲见各组讨论都能深入了解，有所发挥，偶提问题也很精要。五分钟讨论后随恢复秩序。再听讲十分钟，即分组视察实物，也是箭头小组分工互助，约十五分钟略讨论问题，即宣布休息。休息十分钟再入课堂分组操作，始终都由箭头小组彼此互助，所以学员每上一课均当时消化，毫无疑难，因此个个精神饱满，心情愉快。我听见某教授告诉我们，这种集体学习法也适用于教授方面。教授们有教学讨论会，也是集体研究，小组讨论，平时互相听课，互相批评。所以在医大的教学者，不容你不努力改进。由此更可见集体学习只要运用得好，对教学是有很大帮助的。
    还有一个新方法，就是废除向来考试的百分记分制，而改用五级记分。五分的为超等分，就是能于教师所讲授外别有领悟，另所发明，或在课外参考书上寻得新材料者为五分。这样避免了形式主义的评分，而更能发挥同学们的积极性。我们所参与的几个考试，看见得到五分的学员不在少数。
    综合起来说，东北的专科教育及形象教学法是经得考验的，他们所以能得到这样优异的成效，是由于领导正确，执行正确。所以能正确，就因教者、学者只有一个目标，就是“全心全意为人民服务”。
