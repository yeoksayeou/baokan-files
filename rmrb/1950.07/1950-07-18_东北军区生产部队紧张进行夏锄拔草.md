Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 14th: The troops of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army participating in agricultural production are now intensively carrying out summer weeding and rice paddy weeding. The first round of weeding and soil cultivation in dry land areas has been completed in all locations. The second round of weeding by the South Manchuria production troops has also been completed on over 61,000 mu, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the total cultivated land of the South Manchuria troops. Although the North Manchuria production troops started summer weeding later due to seasonal factors, the first round of weeding on 180,000 mu of dry land is about to be completed after half a month of intensive work with high labor enthusiasm by all commanders and fighters. Production troops far in northern Heilongjiang have also completed the first round of weeding on over 700 mu of dry land. Troops participating in rice paddy production at the Panshan Farm in western Liaoning Province and the Niuzhuang Farm in eastern Liaoning Province have generally completed the first round of weeding. Individual units have begun the second round. In order not to miss the farming season, all units have appropriately organized manpower or drawn a portion of the troops participating in transportation construction projects to participate in intensive farm weeding, thus greatly shortening the summer weeding time. A certain division's farm completed the weeding of over 11,000 mu of rice paddies in one week.

While engaging in intensive agricultural production, various units have also organized a large amount of labor to participate in the construction of various mines, transportation, water conservancy and other projects. The troops participating in this type of construction project account for approximately 60 percent of the total force. The project content includes laying railways, highways, mining, digging canals, building houses, and urban sewage systems as contracted projects and various odd jobs. Various projects commenced in late April and early May. Statistics up to the end of June show that a total of more than 664,000 workdays were completed, and the total wages earned, together with the profits from processing industries, have reached 49.48 billion yuan (Northeast currency). It is estimated that various major projects under construction will be completed by the end of August; the wages earned, together with the profits from processing industries, can reach more than 157.3 billion yuan this year.

The troops participating in various construction projects have shown unparalleled enthusiasm, thus creating remarkable achievements in production. When a certain battalion was repairing the Jinzhou-Gubeikou Railway, they completed the task of unloading road stones from the train in nine minutes, which was originally scheduled to take seventeen minutes. A certain division that contracted to repair a section of the Shenyang-Dashiqiao highway had very high labor efficiency. Recently, a certain company was able to repair an average of 8.53 cubic meters per person per day, exceeding the quota set by the Highway Bureau by more than 100 percent. A certain division contracted to repair the Shenyang-Fushun section of the highway. This project was quite large, with a total length of 75 li, including the construction and repair of five bridges, the opening of two sections of mountains, and the opening of one river. Thanks to the efforts of all commanders and fighters, it is estimated that the entire project can be reduced by 12 percent compared to the original number of workdays. The troops participating in the construction projects of mines in Anshan, Benxi, and Jilin are also constantly creating new achievements. A certain unit producing in Anshan completed the task of 6,000 workdays with more than 1,900 workdays. A certain unit stationed in Shenyang completed more than 90,000 cubic meters of canal excavation in just fourteen days ahead of schedule when contracting to repair the Hun River irrigation area, allowing the 60,000 mu of rice paddies on both sides of the river to be fully irrigated. Farmers will therefore be able to increase the area of rice paddies by more than 15,000 mu.

　　东北军区生产部队紧张进行夏锄拔草
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】人民解放军东北军区参加农业生产的部队，现正紧张进行夏锄和水田拔草工作。各地旱田第一遍锄草培土已全部结束。南满生产部队的二遍锄草亦已完成六万一千余亩，约占南满部队耕地总面积的四分之一。北满生产部队虽因季节关系夏锄开始较晚，但经全体指战员以高度的劳动热情进行了半个月的突击，十八万亩旱田的头遍锄草工作即将完成。远在黑龙江北部的生产部队亦已结束了七百余亩旱田的头遍锄草。参加辽西省盘山农场及辽东省牛庄等农场水田生产的部队，已大体拔完第一遍草。个别单位开始拔二遍。为了不误农时，各部均适当组织人力或抽出参加交通修建工程部队的一部人力参加农场突击拔草工作，因此大大缩短了夏锄时间。某师农场在一周时间内即完成了一万一千余亩稻田的拔草任务。
    各部在进行紧张的农业生产同时，还组织了大量劳动力参加各矿山、交通、水利等工程的建设工作。参加此种修建工程的部队约占全军百分之六十左右的人力。工程内容包括铺筑铁路、公路、开矿、挖渠、修建房屋及城市下水道等包工工程和各种零工。各种工程先后在四月末五月初动工。截止六月底统计：共出工六十六万四千余个，所得工资连同加工业的赢利已共有四百九十四亿八千余万元（东北币，下同）。已经兴修的各种较大工程，预计到八月底均可竣工；所得工资连同加工业的赢利今年可达一千五百七十三亿余元。
    参加各种修建工程的部队发挥了无比的热情，因而在生产中创造了显著成绩。某营修筑锦（州）古（北口）铁路，从火车上卸下垫路石头时，以九分钟的时间完成了十七分钟的任务。包修沈阳至大石桥一段公路的某师，劳动效率很高，最近某连平均每人每天能修好八点五三立方米，超过公路局定额百分之百以上。某师包修沈阳至抚顺段公路，此项工程颇为浩大，全段长七十五华里，其中要新建和修补桥梁五座，开山两段，开河一处。由于全体指战员的努力，预计全部工程可较原订工数减少百分之十二。参加鞍山、本溪、吉林等矿山修建工程的部队，也不断创造出新的成绩。在鞍山生产的某部以一千九百余个工完成了六千个工的任务。驻沈阳某部在包修浑河灌溉区时，仅以十四天时间提前完成了九万余立方米的挖渠工程，使该河两岸六万亩稻田得以充分灌溉，农民将因此增开稻田一万五千余亩。
