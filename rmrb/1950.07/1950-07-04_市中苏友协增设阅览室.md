　　Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Adds Reading Room

    To facilitate reading for its members, the Beijing Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will not only move its current reading room to the Beijing Laboring People's Cultural Palace in the coming days, adding books and periodicals to transform it into a library, but will also add several reading rooms in the city. The Municipal Friendship Association began preparations in early June. The first reading room is now ready and opened on July 3rd, located at 5 Xixie Street, Xidan.
    The reading room has many Chinese-Soviet books and newspapers. Inside, Soviet pictures are constantly changed and exhibited. This is the best place for Friendship Association members (especially those in the Xicheng District) to study the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and enhance their spirit of internationalism.
    The Municipal Friendship Association is currently planning to establish four reading rooms in the city by the end of this year, distributed in the east, west, south, and north districts, so that all Friendship Association members in the city can have such convenient reading places.

　　市中苏友协增设阅览室
    北京市中苏友好协会为便利会员阅读，除现在的一个阅览室将于日内移至北京市劳动人民文化宫，再加增添书刊改为图书馆外，另将在市内增设几个阅览室。六月初市友好即展开筹备工作，现第一阅览室已筹备完成，于七月三日开幕，地点在西单西斜街五号。
    该阅览室备有很多的中苏书刊、报纸。在室内并随时更换展览苏联图片、这对友协会员（尤其西城的友协会员）是一个研究苏联、学习苏联、提高国际主义精神最好的地方。
    市友协现正在计划于今年年内在本市成立四个阅览室，分布东、西、南、北区。以使全市友埚都能够有这样便利的阅读场所。（陈应楠）
