　　The Increasing Smoothness of Urban-Rural Material Exchange
　　Private Industry and Commerce in Beijing Gradually Improves

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Beijing's private industry and commerce, within the new relationship between public and private sectors, and between labor and capital, are gradually improving along with the gradual development of urban-rural exchange. In industrial production, output and sales have generally increased. In commercial operations, most businesses have not only seen an increase in sales but also an acceleration in capital turnover.

　　Firstly, in private industry, the output and sales volume of several sectors have increased. Since May, the production volume of Beijing's metal smelting, weaving and dyeing, knitting, machine manufacturing, and other industries has increased. For example, the metal smelting industry received more than 660 tons of orders from government agencies in May, resulting in a 36 percent increase in output compared to April. The weaving and dyeing industry saw a 10 percent increase in overall output in May compared to April. The industry maintained normal production and sales in June, a traditionally slow month, which is a rare occurrence in previous years. The production and sales volume of the knitting industry also saw a significant increase in May and June. Among them, Yizhong, Han Fengyi, and Zhendong three sock factories produced a total of 2,140 dozens of socks in May and sold 1,930 dozens. Compared with April, production increased by 22 percent, and sales increased by 30 percent. The machine manufacturing industry received a batch of orders in May and June (172 tons of pipes and screws for the Ministry of Railways, 20 tons of pipes for the Water Company, 1,200 corn threshers for the Agricultural Machinery General Factory, etc.), which also increased production.

　　The increase in sales volume of industrial products not only enabled the increase of current output of several industries, but also allowed some previously accumulated goods to be sold off. For example, Yuhua Xing of the dyeing and weaving industry produced 864 bolts of cloth in May and sold 1,014 bolts. In addition, surplus products in industries such as papermaking and cigarette manufacturing were also sold off during this period. For example, Xin Yi Cigarette Factory sold nearly 60 cases of inventory in June, and Chuqi Paper Factory sold more than 350 reams of inventory paper. The continuous sale of accumulated products by private enterprises not only made the capital turnover of industries with normal production more flexible, but also provided the conditions for the transformation of several industries with overproduction.

　　Secondly, private commerce is becoming more active. This activity is reflected in the increase in sales, the acceleration of capital turnover, and the comparison of the rise and fall of business openings and closures.

　　According to a survey by the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, in May, the sales volume of ten industries in Beijing, including pig bristles and fur warehouses, department stores, grain stores, silk and satin, oil stores, cotton, timber, hardware, sacks, and tea, have increased, and business is improving day by day. Some businesses have already made profits. For example, the pig bristles and fur warehouse industry saw an increase of more than 18 percent in overall sales in May compared to April. The net profit earned in May increased more than twofold compared to April. The sales volume of department stores in May was also more than 4 percent higher than in April. In the two months of May and June, the business of department stores such as Wangfu and Dahua developed significantly. Taking sales as an example, Wangfu Department Store increased by 25 percent in May compared to April, and increased by another 10 percent in June compared to May. In addition, some industries that were losing a lot of money also saw a turnaround in May, such as the paint industry, whose net loss in May decreased by 21 percent compared to April.

　　The acceleration of capital turnover in several industries also shows the vitality of commercial operations. Taking the four industries of department stores, cloth, paint, and silk and satin as examples, the capital turnover rate in May accelerated compared to April. For example, the turnover rate of department stores in May was 1.53 times, an increase of nearly two times compared to 0.55 times in April. The cloth industry increased by 3 percent, and the paint industry increased by more than 25 percent.

　　In Beijing's commerce, the number of business openings is gradually increasing, and the number of business closures is gradually decreasing. In addition, 41 businesses that had applied for closure have voluntarily withdrawn their applications for closure and are regrouping to start anew.

### 城乡物资交流日益通畅  京私营工商业逐步好转

　　城乡物资交流日益通畅
    京私营工商业逐步好转
    【本报讯】北京私营工商业在新的公私、劳资关系中，伴随着城乡交流的逐渐开展，逐步好转起来。工业生产中，产销量普遍增加了。商业经营中，多数商号不仅销货额增加了，资金周转率也加速起来。
    首先是私营工业中，若干行业的产量和销量都增加了。五月份以后，北京金属冶制、织染、针织、机器制造等工业的生产量都有增加，如金属冶制业在五月接受了六百六十余吨的机关订货，使五月份产量较四月增加百分之三十六；织染业全业五月份的产量较四月份增加百分之十，在该业六月的淡月中，产销依然正常，这是历年少有的现象。针织业五、六月的产销量也均有显著增加，该业中的一中、韩凤仪、振东三家袜厂，五月份共产袜子二千一百四十打，销出一千九百三十打，与四月份比较产量增加百分之二十二，销量增加百分之三十。机器制造业在五、六月份接受了一批定货（铁道部管子、螺丝等一七二吨，自来水公司管子二十吨，农业机械总厂玉米脱粒机一千二百台等），产量因而也增加了。
    由于工业产品销售量的增加，不仅使若干工业现产量得以增加，以往积压的货品也可随之脱售一部，如染织业的裕华兴，五月份产布八百六十四匹，销布一千零十四匹。另外如造纸、卷烟等行业过剩的产品在这阶段中也销出了一部，如信一烟厂六月份销存货近六十箱，初起纸厂销存纸三百五十多令。私营企业积压产品的陆续售出，不仅使生产正常的工业资金周转灵活，对若干生产过剩的行业也提供了转业的条件。
    其次是私营商业普遍活跃起来了。这种活跃表现在售货额的增加，资金周转率加速和商号开歇业升降的比较上面。
    据市商业局的调查，在五月份京市猪鬃皮毛货栈、百货、粮栈、绸缎、油店、棉花、木业、五金、麻袋、茶叶等十个行业的销货额都有增加，营业日见好转，部分的商号已获得盈余。如猪鬃皮毛货栈业，五月份全业销货额较四月份增加百分之十八强。五月份所获纯益较四月增加二倍以上。百货业五月份销货额比四月也多百分之四强。该业王府、大华等百货公司在五、六两个月里，营业都有显著的开展，以销售额一项来说，王府百货公司五月比四月增加百分之二十五，六月比五月再增加百分之十。另外有些赔钱很多的行业在五月份也有了转机，如颜料业五月份的纯损较四月减少了百分之二十一。
    若干行业的资金周转率的加速也显示出商业营业的活泼。以百货、布业、颜料、绸缎四个行业来说，五月份资金周转率均较四月份加速，如百货业五月份周转率是一点五三倍，比四月份零点五五倍增加了近两倍。布业增加了百分之三，颜料增加了百分之二十五强。
    北京商业中，开业日渐增多，歇业日渐减少。并有四十一户曾呈请歇业的商号又自动撤销了歇业的申请，重整旗鼓干起来了。
