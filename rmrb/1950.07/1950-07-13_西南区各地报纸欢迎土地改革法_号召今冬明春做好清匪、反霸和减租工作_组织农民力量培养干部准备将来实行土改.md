Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. People in various parts of the Southwest enthusiastically welcome the promulgation of the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China." Newspapers in cities such as Chongqing and Kunming published the full text of the Land Reform Law on the 30th under extra-large headlines and published editorials expressing warm welcome. The editorial of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily was entitled "Hail the Promulgation of the Land Reform Law." The newspaper pointed out that the Southwest was liberated relatively late, and the conditions for land reform are not yet ripe, so land reform cannot be carried out this winter and spring. However, all parts of the Southwest must carry out the suppression of bandits, opposition to local tyrants, and rent reduction this winter and spring. The newspaper hopes that all agencies, troops, factories, schools, people's organizations, and people of all strata in the Southwest will widely study the Land Reform Law so that workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie will be fully prepared ideologically for the future implementation of land reform. The newspaper also called on all parts of the Southwest to organize and strengthen the forces of the peasants, train a large number of peasant cadres, and prepare for land reform in the movement to eliminate bandits, oppose local tyrants, and reduce rent this winter and spring. The commentary in the Kunming Yunnan Daily also pointed out that the conditions for implementing land reform in Yunnan Province are not yet mature, but rent reduction must be implemented this autumn to alleviate the suffering of peasants, raise their awareness, and establish and improve peasant associations to lay the foundation for land reform. The newspaper also particularly emphasized that the Land Reform Law does not apply to minority areas.
