Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 23rd (TASS dispatch): As previously reported, Colonel Polyezhayenko, assistant to Lieutenant General Derevyanko, the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan, on behalf of Lieutenant General Derevyanko, sent a letter to General MacArthur on June 24th regarding the suppression of Japanese labor unions, the Communist Party, and other democratic organizations by the American occupation authorities and the Japanese government.

Unable to deny the facts contained in Colonel Polyezhayenko's letter, General MacArthur, in a rude-toned reply delivered to the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan on June 25th, rejected the Soviet representative's demand to cease the illegal actions against Japanese labor unions, the Communist Party, and other democratic organizations without providing any reasoning related to the main point of the issue.

Colonel Polyezhayenko sent a letter to General MacArthur on July 17th in response to the aforementioned reply. The letter reads as follows:

"I have received your reply of June 25th of this year to Lieutenant General Derevyanko's, the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan, letter of June 24th.

In his letter, the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan insisted on guaranteeing the freedom of activity for all democratic parties, including the Japanese Communist Party, labor unions, and other Japanese democratic organizations, and on ceasing the suppression of labor union leaders and other Japanese democrats. The demands made in this letter are based on the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration of the governments of the United States, Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. The provisions stipulate that the Japanese government must remove all obstacles hindering the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, religion, and thought, as well as respect for fundamental human rights, should be established.

The Supreme Commander has rejected these legitimate demands and has once again shown that he does not understand the Potsdam Declaration and other joint decisions of the nations related to the democratization of Japan. The Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan is not surprised by the Supreme Commander's attitude toward his letter of June 24th. Because the facts speak clearly: the Supreme Commander's activities in Japan demonstrate that he has no democratic spirit and lacks even a basic understanding of the task of promoting the democratization of Japan.

The Supreme Commander's actions in recent years, especially his recent illegal actions, demonstrate that his policy is not to guarantee the freedom of activity of Japanese democratic organizations and the basic democratic rights and freedoms of the Japanese people, but to wholeheartedly trample on the rights of the Japanese people's democratic organizations.

I am instructed to state that, in view of the above circumstances, the Supreme Commander's letter of June 25th cannot be regarded as a reply to the letter of the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan; I am also instructed to firmly state that the Soviet member's demands in the previous letter regarding the cessation of illegal actions against Japanese labor unions, the Communist Party, and other democratic organizations remain fully valid."

### 麦克阿瑟继续非法压制日本民主组织  苏联驻日代表再次提出抗议

　　麦克阿瑟继续非法压制日本民主组织
    苏联驻日代表再次提出抗议
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社东京二十三日讯：如前此报道，盟国对日委员会苏联委员德勒维扬哥中将的助理波莱耶兴哥上校，曾奉德勒维扬哥中将之命，于六月二十四日就美国占领当局和日本政府镇压日本工会、共产党及其他民主组织一事，致函麦克阿瑟将军。
    麦克阿瑟将军无法否认波莱耶兴哥的上述信件中所包含的事实，在六月二十五日以复信递交盟国对日委员会苏联委员，这封复信措词口吻粗鲁，其中没有提出任何有关问题主旨的理由，就拒绝了苏联代表关于停止对日本工会、共产党及其他民主组织的非法行动的要求。
    波莱耶兴哥上校于七月十七日致函麦克阿瑟将军，答复上述复信。函件内容如下：
    “我已收到你在本年六月二十五日答复盟国对日委员会苏联委员德勒维扬哥中将六月二十四日信件的复信。
    盟国对日委员会苏联委员在他的信中，坚持必须保证包括日本共产党在内的各民主党派、工会和其他日本民主组织的活动自由，必须终止对工会领袖和其他日本民主人士的压制。在这封信里所提出的要求，都是根据美国、英国、中国和苏联四国政府的波茨坦宣言的条款。条款规定，日本政府必须去除一切妨碍在日本人民中恢复和加强民主趋向的障碍。应该确立言论、宗教和思想的自由，以及对于基本人权的尊重。
    最高统帅拒绝了这些合法的要求，又一次地表明他不了解波茨坦宣言以及与日本的民主化有关的国家的其他共同决定。盟国对日委员会苏联委员对最高统帅对他的六月二十四日的信件的态度，并不感到惊讶。因为事实说得很清楚：最高统帅在日本的活动，证明他毫无民主气息，甚至对促进日本民主化的任务都没有基本了解。
    最高统帅近年来的行为，特别是他最近非法的行动，说明他的政策不是保证日本民主组织的活动自由和日本人民的基本民主权利和自由，而是一心要蹂躏日本人民的民主组织的权利。
    我受命声明：鉴于上述的情形，最高统帅的六月二十五日的信件，不能被视为是对盟国对日委员会苏联委员的信件的答复；我同时受命坚决表示：苏联委员在前信中提出的关于停止对日本的工会、共产党以及其他民主组织的非法行动的要求，仍然完全有效。”
