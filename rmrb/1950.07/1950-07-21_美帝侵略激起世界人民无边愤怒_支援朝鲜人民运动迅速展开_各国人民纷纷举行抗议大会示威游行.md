Xinhua News Agency, 20th—The US imperialists' open armed intervention in Korea and their brutal slaughter of peaceful Korean residents have aroused boundless anger among peace-loving people all over the world. A massive movement to support the Korean people and oppose US imperialist armed intervention is rapidly unfolding in all parts of the world.

　　"Oppose US Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Week" has begun in various parts of China. After US President Truman issued his shameless statement on June 27 further interfering in Asian affairs, all democratic parties and people's organizations in China unanimously condemned the bandit behavior of US imperialism. The Chinese people's movement to support the Korean people's struggle for liberation is being combined with the movement to oppose US imperialist aggression against Taiwan.

　　The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army is responding to the US's intensified aggression against Vietnam by intensifying its attacks on the US-equipped French colonial army and its puppet groups, and supporting the Korean people's struggle against the US aggressors. Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has called on the Vietnamese people to resolutely eliminate the French and American interventionists.

　　In Japan, which is being used by the American bandits as a base for aggression against Korea, patriotic people and hundreds of thousands of patriotic Korean residents have formed a united front and are carrying out a heroic struggle in ports such as Fukuoka and Yokohama to refuse to transport military supplies to Korea. Workers at shipyards in Nagasaki and other places refused to repair foreign ships from South Korea, and a large number of leaflets opposing the war of aggression were flying everywhere. In Mongolia, India, and Israel in the Middle East, anti-US aggression against Korea protests and demonstrations were also held.

　　Australian workers, regardless of the persecution by their fascist government, insisted on refusing to load weapons to Japan for transfer to Korea. The people of Melbourne and Sydney also held anti-intervention demonstrations.

　　In the fortress of the world's peace and democracy camp—the Soviet capital Moscow and other major cities, many factories and institutions have held mass rallies since July 1. Moscow workers said: "We demand that the US troops withdraw from Korea and let the US imperialists know: this is the voice of millions of Soviet people." The people of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Albania and other countries also held many protest meetings and telegraphed their support to the Korean people who are fighting heroically. The working people of the German Democratic Republic shouted in unison at mass rallies: "No intervention in Korea!"

　　In Western Europe, trade union organizations and people's groups in Britain, France, Denmark and other countries have continuously lodged protests with the US embassies. Mass protest rallies and demonstrations are vigorously developing in many cities in Britain, France, Italy and West Germany. British workers telegraphed British Prime Minister Attlee in early July, saying: "We do not want our country to be used as a tool for American war-mongers." Similar protest rallies were also held in many cities in Norway, Sweden and Finland.

　　In the United States, 10,000 people in New York held a demonstration rally on June 28 "against intervention in Korea." The movement against intervention in Korea is unfolding in many local American trade unions. At the same time, the American people are further launching a signature campaign to oppose the US government's armed intervention in Korea. Since Truman issued his statement on aggression against Korea, 400,000 people have signed the peace declaration. The people of Cuba and Chile in Central and South America have also expressed their firm opposition to the US crime of aggression against Korea.

　　The world's peace movement is now combined with the movement to support the Korean people. The World Federation of Trade Unions' call to workers around the world to organize "Worldwide Week of Active Support for the Korean People" has been responded to by international organizations such as the International Democratic Women's Federation and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Workers, women, youth and progressive people from all walks of life around the world who love peace and oppose war are expressing their interconnected sympathy and support to the heroic Korean people.

　　美帝侵略激起世界人民无边愤怒
    支援朝鲜人民运动迅速展开
    各国人民纷纷举行抗议大会示威游行
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义者公开武装干涉朝鲜及其残暴屠杀朝鲜和平居民的兽行，引起了全世界爱好和平人民的无边愤怒。一个支援朝鲜人民和反对美帝国主义武装干涉的巨大运动，正在全世界各地迅速展开。
    “反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动周”已在中国各地开始。中国各民主党派和人民团体，在美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日发表进一步干涉亚洲事务的无耻声明后，曾一致痛斥美帝国主义的强盗行为。中国人民支援朝鲜人民解放斗争的运动，正和反对美帝国主义侵略台湾的运动结合起来。
    越南的人民解放军正在以加紧打击美国装备的法国殖民军及其傀儡集团，来回答美国对越南的加紧侵略，并支援朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者的斗争。越南民主共和国主席胡志明已号召越南人民坚决消灭法、美干涉者。
    在正被美国强盗用作侵略朝鲜基地的日本，爱国人民和数十万旅日的朝鲜爱国侨民结成了统一战线，在福冈、横滨等港口进行着英勇的拒绝运输军用物资到朝鲜去的斗争。长崎等地造船厂的工人，拒绝修理来自南朝鲜的外国船只，大批反对侵略战争的传单在各地纷飞。在蒙古、印度和中东的以色列，也举行了反对美国侵略朝鲜的抗议大会和示威。
    澳大利亚工人不顾其法西斯政府的迫害，坚持拒绝装运武器运日转朝鲜。墨尔本和悉尼两城的人民并举行了反干涉的示威游行。
    在世界和平民主阵营的堡垒——苏联首都莫斯科及其他主要城市，许多工厂和机关自七月一日起纷纷举行群众大会。莫斯科的工人说：“我们要求美军撤出朝鲜，让美帝国主义者知道：这是千百万苏联人民的声音”。捷、波、罗、匈、阿尔巴尼亚等国的人民，也举行了许多抗议性的会议，并纷纷通电声援正在英勇斗争中的朝鲜人民。德意志民主共和国劳动人民在群众大会上齐声高呼：“不准干涉朝鲜！”
    在西欧，英、法、丹麦等国的工会组织和人民团体不断地向美国大使馆提出抗议。英、法、意和西德的许多城市，群众性的抗议集会和示威在蓬勃地开展着。英国工人于七月上旬打电报给英首相艾德礼说：“我们不要我们的国家作为美国战争贩子们的工具”。挪威、瑞典和芬兰的许多城市也举行了同样的抗议集会。
    在美国国内，纽约一万人于六月二十八日举行了“反对干涉朝鲜”的示威大会。反对干涉朝鲜的运动，正在许多美国地方工会中展开。与此同时，美国人民正在进一步开展签名运动，来反对美国政府对朝鲜的武装干涉。在杜鲁门发表侵略朝鲜的声明以后，已有四十万人在和平宣言上签了名。中南美的古巴和智利的人民，也表示了坚决反对美国侵略朝鲜的罪行。
    全世界人民的拥护和平运动现在已和声援朝鲜人民的运动结合起来了。世界工会联合会向全世界的工人发出组织“全世界积极支援朝鲜人民周”的号召，已获得了国际民主妇联与世界民主青联等国际性组织的响应。全世界爱好和平、反对战争的工人、妇女、青年及各界进步人士，正在向英勇的朝鲜人民表示他们休戚相关的同情与支持。
