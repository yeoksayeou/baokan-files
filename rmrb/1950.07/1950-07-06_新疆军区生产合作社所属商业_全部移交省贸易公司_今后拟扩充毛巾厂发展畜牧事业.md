Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The Production Cooperative affiliated with the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, after receiving the instruction from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government strictly prohibiting military units and organizations from engaging in commercial activities, has transferred all of its commercial operations to the Provincial Trading Company. It has also been decided that future efforts will focus on vigorously developing handicrafts, animal husbandry, and other productive endeavors. The transfer of goods, equipment, and buildings of the five retail outlets, as well as the native products department, warehouse, wool washing factory, sausage factory in Dihua, and the Yanqi branch, has been completed. The original staff will continue to work under the leadership of the Trading Company. Branches of the Cooperative outside Dihua, where there are branches of the Trading Company, have also completed the transfer process. Branches and sub-branches that have not yet completed the transfer have been entrusted by the Trading Company to purchase native products in order to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In the future, the Military Region Production Cooperative will strengthen the operation of its production enterprises. In terms of handicrafts, it plans to expand the towel factory with the goal of supplying the needs of all troops in Xinjiang next year. In terms of animal husbandry, it plans to increase the original flock of five thousand sheep to twenty thousand sheep and establish other pastures in general, systematically improving breeds to serve as a demonstration for the development of animal husbandry in Xinjiang.
