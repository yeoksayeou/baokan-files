    Huaining County Bank in Northern Anhui Implements Cash Management
    The People's Bank of Huaining County, Northern Anhui, implemented the government's decision on cash management. After a joint meeting of chief cashiers and accountants from various government agencies, organizations, and enterprises in late April, bank deposits increased monthly. Total deposits in April were over 40.92 million yuan, over 69.93 million yuan in May, and over 84.407 million yuan by June 16th. The bank is now sending specialists to conduct investigations and understand the situation in various units, preparing to establish income and expenditure plans for each unit.

    Jianping County Cooperative in Hebei Neglects Cash Management
    Since the People's Bank of Jianping County, Hebei, implemented the measures for public enterprises, agencies, military units, and cooperatives to deposit cash in the bank, the county's supply and marketing cooperative has emphasized objective reasons, disregarded overall interests, and delayed deposits. After supervision by the county government, they continued to adopt perfunctory measures. On May 19th, they reluctantly deposited 1.87 million yuan (part of which was non-circulating old currency and small denominations). By June 8th, they had only deposited three sums totaling 11.8 million yuan. To understand their cash income and expenditure situation, the bank drafted a "Cash Transfer Income and Expenditure Balance Sheet" requiring them to submit it daily, but the cooperative claimed they were too busy to report it regularly.

    河北建屏县社轻视现金管理
    河北建屏县人民银行自执行各公营企业、机关、部队及合作社现金存行办法以来，该县供销社强调客观原因，不顾整体利益，拖延存解，经县府督导后，仍采应付手段，不得已于五月十九日存入一笔一八七万元（其中一部是不能流通的旧币及小额票），截至六月八日才仅存三笔一千一百八十万元。银行为了解其现金收支情况，曾拟定“现金转账收支余额表”令其每日填报，但该社却推说工作忙不能经常上报。
