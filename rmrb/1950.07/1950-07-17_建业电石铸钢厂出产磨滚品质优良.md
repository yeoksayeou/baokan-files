　　Jianye Calcium Carbide Steel Foundry Produces High-Quality Grinding Rollers
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The privately-owned Jianye Calcium Carbide Steel Foundry in Beijing has successfully manufactured grinding rollers for flour mills, with a quality comparable to imported products but at a lower price. Since the liberation of Beijing, the factory has been working hard to research and manufacture grinding rollers. Through the joint efforts of the factory director, technicians, and workers, they overcame various difficulties and achieved success in April of this year. After testing at the Mechanical Engineering Department of Yenching University, it was proven that the hardness of the cast iron met the standards. Subsequently, the Tongcheng Flour Company in Beijing used them and confirmed that their performance was not much different from that of imported products. The flour produced did not turn gray or change color, and there were no changes in the machine's gears or temperature. Each unit costs approximately 25% to 30% less than American-made products; for example, one with a diameter of 250 mm and a length of 800 mm is 2.5 million yuan cheaper.

　　建业电石铸钢厂出产磨滚品质优良
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营建业电石铸钢厂制造面粉机磨滚成功，品质与舶来品相差无几，价格也较便宜。该厂自北京解放后就努力研究制造磨滚，经厂长、技师与工人协力克服种种困难，于本年四月获得成功。送燕京大学机械系试验后，证明铸铁硬度合乎标准。后经本市通诚面粉公司采用，证明效能与舶来品无大差别，磨出面粉不反灰不变色，机器丝齿与温度也无变化。每具价格约比美货低百分之二十五到三十，如直径二百五十米厘长八百米厘的就便宜二百五十万元。
