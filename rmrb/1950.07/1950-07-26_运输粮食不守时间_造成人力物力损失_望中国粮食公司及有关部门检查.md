　　Untimely Grain Transportation Causes Losses of Manpower and Resources
    Awaiting Inspection by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation and Relevant Departments

    Editor Comrade:

    The China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation and the Northeast Grain Corporation agreed to transfer coarse grains from the Northeast into customs, exchanging them for fine grains from the masses through cooperatives. According to the notification from the North China Federation of Cooperatives and the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, the Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative Headquarters and the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Corporation allocated the first batch of grain to Liaocheng Prefecture as 800,000 jin of red sorghum, the second batch as 3,000,000 jin of coarse grains, and 2,000,000 jin of soybean cakes. However, the first batch arrived one day late, and the second batch was already eight days overdue as of July 8th. All the coarse grains had not arrived, and only 1,450,000 jin of soybean cakes had been transported (still short of 550,000 jin). As a result, this caused two major losses.

    For the first batch of red sorghum, the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Corporation notified that it would arrive in Yucheng on May 16th. In order to comply with railway regulations (goods not transported within 24 hours of arrival will be fined), we mobilized 125 carts and 4 trucks from various counties to Yucheng Station before the 16th to prepare for grain transportation. However, the grain only arrived on the evening of the 17th. Thus, being one day late, it overspent on food and fodder, totaling 4,153 jin of red sorghum, which was all compensated by the Grain Corporation.

    The second batch of coarse grains was originally scheduled to be received in Dezhou and Yucheng, to be transported completely from June 5th to the end of the month (as per notification from the provincial cooperative and provincial corporation). The local government mobilized 418 carts, 838 livestock, and 830 cart drivers (entering into transport contracts with transportation stations); the cooperatives jointly dispatched 18 cadres on the 10th, the Grain Corporation dispatched 15 cadres, and another 5 militiamen. To date, it has been overdue for eight days, and the grain has not yet arrived. Thirty-two cadres have had nothing to do for twenty-eight days. As for the soybean cakes, although some have arrived, the remaining 550,000 jin are still nowhere in sight. Because of this, hundreds of boatmen have been waiting idly in Luokou for nine days. This not only greatly wastes manpower and financial resources, but also affects the people's trust in the government.

    The occurrence of the above problems involves many departments, and we have no way of knowing the reasons. Inquires to the Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative also yield no specific information. Now, although we have received instructions from the provincial cooperative that the corporation is responsible for economic compensation, it has not mentioned the issue of responsibility for political losses. I believe that the transfer of millions of jin of grain is related to the production of hundreds of thousands of people, and the relevant departments should conduct a thorough inspection of such sloppiness in their work.

　　运输粮食不守时间  造成人力物力损失
    望中国粮食公司及有关部门检查编辑同志：
    中国粮食公司与东北粮食公司协议调运东北粗粮入关，通过合作社，向群众交换细粮。按平原省合作总社与平原省粮食公司根据华北合作总社及中国粮食公司的通知，拨给聊城专区的第一批粮食为红粮八十万斤，第二批为粗粮三百万斤，豆饼二百万斤。但第一批运达，逾期一天，第二批截至七月八日已逾期八天，粗粮全未运到，豆饼亦只运来一百四十五万斤（尚差五十五万斤）。因之，造成两次巨大的损失。
    第一批运来的红粮，平原省粮食公司通知五月十六日到达禹城。我们为遵守铁路规章（货到超过二十四小时运不出去要受罚），于十六日前便由各县调集禹城车站大车一百二十五辆，汽车四辆准备运粮。但至十七日晚，粮才运到。这样，逾期一天，逾支了伙食、马料计红粮四千一百五十三斤，全由粮食公司赔补。
    第二批粗粮原规定由德州、禹城两地接收，于六月五日至月底运完（有省社省公司通知可查）。该地政府调运大车四百一十八辆，牲口八百三十八头，车夫八百三十人（与运输栈订立运输合同）；合作社于十日共抽调干部十八人，粮食公司抽调十五人，另民兵五人。迄今已逾期八天，粮仍未到。三十二个干部二十八天没有工作可做。至于豆饼，虽已到达一部分，但余下的五十五万斤仍遥遥无期。为此，百余船夫已在洛口空等了九天。这便不但大大地浪费了人力、财力，且影响了群众对政府的信任。
    以上问题之发生，因牵涉部门很多，其原因我们无从了解，请示平原省合作社也不知底细。现在，我们虽已接到省社指示由公司负经济上赔偿之责，但并未提及造成政治上损失的责任问题。我认为数百万斤粮食之调运，关系着数十万群众生产，而有关部门在工作上竟这样草率，实应作深刻检查。
