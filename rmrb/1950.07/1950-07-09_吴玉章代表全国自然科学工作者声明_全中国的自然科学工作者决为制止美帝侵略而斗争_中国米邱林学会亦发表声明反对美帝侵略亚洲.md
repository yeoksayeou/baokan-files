Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China First Congress of Natural Science Workers, issued a statement on Truman's aggressive statement, saying: We, on behalf of all of China's natural science workers, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of June 28. No matter how vicious American imperialism and its running dogs are, we firmly believe that the Chinese people will victoriously liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American imperialists, and we firmly believe that the great power of the Chinese and Asian people will shatter the American imperialists' dream of aggression.

The statement continued: The imperialists' clamoring and intimidation cannot frighten the people; it is futile to try to stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and all acts of aggression that undermine peace in the Far East will inevitably be met with a relentless rebuff. We, all of China's scientific workers, will take resolute action to fight to stop the American imperialists' new aggression in the East.

[This newspaper reported] The Chinese Michurin Society issued a statement on July 7th opposing the American imperialists' barbaric acts of armed aggression in Asia. The statement said: "This kind of狂暴[狂暴 - violent, unrestrained] aggressive behavior by American imperialists is opposed by the vast majority of people around the world - peace-loving people. We Michurin workers, in order to consolidate peace, increase production, and increase the happiness of mankind, must resolutely eliminate "war theory," "Malthusian population theory," "racism" and other fascist theories." The statement said: "We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and are determined to liberate Taiwan and work with all the people of Asia to defeat the aggression of American imperialism."
