    Weicun Village in Lincheng Makes Great Efforts in Cotton Planting, Rated as a First-Class Model Village
    Gong Laoyue, a labor hero from Weicun Village in Lincheng County, Hebei Province, has made great efforts in leading the entire village in cotton planting. The village planted 463 mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan of 350 mu by more than 32%, and was rated as a first-class model village. During the wheat harvest season, more than 300 mu of cotton seedlings were infested with aphids. Gong Laoyue mobilized the masses to spray pesticide. After the wheat harvest, he mobilized the masses to hoe the fields meticulously three times to maintain soil moisture. By June 27, the cotton seedlings had grown to about 1.5 feet tall. He then mobilized the masses to hoe for the fourth time, removing excess branches and old leaves. After the rain on July 1, the village's cotton fields were hoeed a fifth time. Now the cotton seedlings are growing very strong and have begun to bloom and bear bolls. As long as there is another good rain (or another watering if it doesn't rain), a good harvest can be guaranteed.

    临城魏村植棉努力  被评为一等模范村
    河北省临城县魏村劳动英雄宫老月，对全村植棉的领导极为尽力，使该村植棉四百六十三亩，超过原计划植三百五十亩的百分之三十二强，被评为一等模范村。在麦收时节，有三百余亩棉苗生了蚜虫，宫老月就发动群众普遍用药水喷杀；麦收后又动员了群众细锄三遍，以保持土壤的泾润。六月二十七日棉苗已长到尺半高。他又动员群众锄第四遍，打去疯杈和老叶。七月一日雨后，该村棉田又普遍锄了第五遍。现棉苗都长的很壮，已经开始开花结桃。只要再下一次好雨（如不下雨再浇一次水），就可保证丰收。
