Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 16th: Shanghai newspapers jointly published a protest statement on the 16th, protesting the persecution of the Japanese Communist Party's central organ *Akahata* by the American and Japanese reactionaries. The protest statement was signed by *Shanghai Jiefang Daily*, *Xinwen Daily*, *Ta Kung Pao*, *Wen Hui Bao*, *Shanghai News* (English), *Xinmin Bao*, *Labor Daily*, *Youth Daily*, *New Children's Daily*, *Da Bao*, and *Yi Bao*. The protest statement pointed out: This crime of the American and Japanese reactionaries violates the Potsdam Declaration and deprives the Japanese people of freedom of speech and democratic rights; it fully proves that American imperialism and its running dog, the Japanese reactionaries, are the enemies of the Japanese people. The protest statement said: "We, the journalists of Shanghai, in order to safeguard the people's democratic rights and freedom of the press, completely sympathize with and absolutely support the arduous struggle of our progressive Japanese journalist brothers. We lodge an angry protest against the American and Japanese reactionaries." The protest statement concluded: "The awareness of the people of the world has been raised, and the people of the East have risen up. The Japanese people's struggle against the American bandits is not isolated. We, all the staff of Shanghai newspapers, are determined to fight to the end with the progressive, patriotic journalists of Japan against the American bandits. We are bound to win."
