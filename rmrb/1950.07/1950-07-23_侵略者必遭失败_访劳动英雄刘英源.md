　　Invaders Will Inevitably Fail
    An Interview with Labor Hero Liu Yingyuan
    By Our Reporter Feng Zhong
    The American imperialists' open armed aggression against the people of Asia has aroused the anger of Liu Yingyuan, a labor hero and director of the Capital Power Plant.
    Liu Yingyuan is fifty-two years old this year. Most of his life has been a history of being oppressed by imperialism and its lackeys. When he was a teenager, he recognized the hideous face of imperialism. He himself talked about fragments of his childhood being bullied: At the age of twelve, he carried children for the Japanese in Shenyang. He was so exhausted that he was covered in excrement and urine, and he had no time to wipe it off. In this way, he could only eat some leftovers and scraps of food every day, and he was scolded and beaten all the time, just like a child without a master. He barely managed for a year before crying to his parents to stop him from doing it. Later, he went to the British-run British American Tobacco Company to pack cigarettes. Just because his hands were rough, he was kicked hard by a British capitalist. How dare a thirteen-year-old child resist? He wiped away his tears and ran home to complain to his father, but his father said, "Foreigners 'hit your waist,' we can't afford to offend them, what can we do?" When the Japanese devils invaded and occupied the Northeast, Liu Yingyuan was working in the Harbin Power Plant, and his life became worse day by day. He described the situation at that time: "Being a slave of a conquered country is much more difficult than being a child without a mother." He had thought countless times: When will the Chinese people be free from being angry with the imperialists?
    Liu Yingyuan suddenly remembered something he would never forget in his life, and this made him excited: Last year, he participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and heard Chairman Mao say with his own ears: "The Chinese people have stood up from now on." This is exactly what he had hoped for for decades.
    Today, American imperialism has once again invaded our territory of Taiwan and attacked Korea. Old Hero Liu expressed confidently: "The Chinese people will certainly and have the power to liberate Taiwan." "The Korean people will certainly be able to defeat the American imperialist aggression and unify the whole country."
    He said: The Chinese people had the power to defeat Japanese imperialism in the past, and they had the power to defeat the American imperialist's lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Today, the Chinese people are stronger than before and have enough power to defeat the American imperialist aggression and liberate our territory of Taiwan.
    Regarding the victory of the Korean People's Army, Liu Yingyuan mentioned that when he was working in the Harbin Power Plant, his colleagues secretly circulated the deeds of General Kim Il-sung. At that time, the Korean People's Guerrilla Army led by General Kim Il-sung fought side by side with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army at that time, giving the Japanese devils heavy blows countless times. The Korean People's Army is brave, alert, disciplined, loves the people, and gets along with the Korean and Chinese Northeastern people like a family. This powerful army supported by the people is now carrying out a just anti-aggression battle for the unification and independence of the motherland, and victory is inevitable.
    On the other hand, what is the American empire like? Liu Yingyuan said: "I have long seen through that the American empire is a paper tiger. It only spends money and takes weapons to call on others to fight and sell their lives for it, picking up bargains from it. However, lackeys like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee have been successively overthrown by the people, so they have to send their own invading troops to Taiwan and Korea to do it themselves. Now this paper tiger can no longer be hidden. In the past, some people thought that the United States was not easy to provoke, with big soldiers and strong weapons, but the American soldiers took modern weapons to Korea, and they were dizzy when they fought. They ran away when they heard the cannons. Soldiers were killed and captured; planes were shot down; warships were sunk. Let those who are afraid of the United States also get to know the United States?!"
    Finally, Liu Yingyuan called on workers across the country to work hard to produce, use all their strength to support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan, support the Korean people's just anti-aggression war, and drive American imperialism out of Asia. He also called on American workers and Taiwanese workers to rise up in strikes and struggles; called on American soldiers to recognize the truth, lay down their weapons, and not sell their lives for a few monopoly capitalists; and called on people all over the world to unite and defend world peace.

　　侵略者必遭失败
    访劳动英雄刘英源
    本报记者  冯仲
    美帝国主义对亚洲人民公开武装侵略的行为，激起了劳动英雄刘英源——首都发电厂厂长的愤怒。
    刘英源今年五十二岁了。他多半辈子的经历是一篇受帝国主义和它的走狗压迫的历史，他在十几岁的时候，就认识了帝国主义的狰狞面目。他自己谈起幼年时受欺侮的片断历史：十二岁在沈阳给日本人背孩子，一天累得要死，身上被拉上屎尿，也没有工夫擦，就这样，一天只能吃到些剩饭剩菜，还整天挨骂受打，和没主的孩子一样。勉强对付了一年，向父母哭叫着才算不去干了。以后，又到英国人办的英美烟草公司装烟卷，只是因为手粗，就被英国资本家狠狠的踢了一脚，一个十三岁的孩子那敢反抗？抹着眼泪跑回家去向父亲哭诉，但是父亲说：“外国人‘打腰’，咱惹不起，又有啥办法呢？”日寇侵陷东北，刘英源正在哈尔滨发电厂做工，生活更一天不如一天，他形容那时的情况：“当亡国奴真比没娘的孩子难受多少倍。”他曾无数次的想：中国人多咱才能不受帝国主义者的气呢？
    刘英源突然想起一件一辈子都忘不掉的事，这件事使他兴奋起来：去年参加中国人民政协，亲耳听到毛主席讲：“中国人从此站立起来了。”这正是他数十年来的愿望。
    今天，美帝国主义又来侵略我国领土台湾，进攻朝鲜。刘老英雄有信心地表示：“中国人民一定而且有力量解放台湾。”“朝鲜人民也一定能打败美帝的侵略，统一全国。”
    他说：中国人民过去有力量战胜日本帝国主义，有力量战胜美帝的走狗蒋介石匪帮，今天中国人民比那时更壮大了，更有足够的力量击败美帝的侵略，解放我们的领土台湾。
    关于朝鲜人民军的胜利刘英源谈到他在哈尔滨发电厂做工时，工友们就暗中传述过金日成将军的事迹。那时，金日成将军领导的朝鲜人民游击队与当时的东北抗日联军并肩作战，曾无数次地给予日寇以重重的打击。朝鲜人民军勇敢机警，纪律好，爱人民，和朝鲜的、中国东北的老百姓相处如一家人，这一支有人民支持的强大部队，今天为祖国统一独立进行正义的反侵略战斗，胜利是必然的。
    反过来再看看美帝又是什么样子呢？刘英源说：“早就看透了美帝是纸老虎，它只会出钱、拿武器叫别人替它打仗卖命，从中拣便宜，但是，像蒋介石、李承晚这类走狗们陆续被人民打倒了，所以不得不自己出动侵略军到台湾、到朝鲜动手，这下子这只纸老虎再也瞒不住人了。过去还有些人认为美国不好惹，兵个子大，武器强，但是美国兵拿着近代武器到了朝鲜，一打仗就晕了，听到炮响撒腿就跑；士兵被打死、被俘虏；飞机被打落；军舰被击沉；让害怕美国的人也认识认识美国？！”
    最后，刘英源号召全国工人努力生产，用尽一切力量，支援人民解放军解放台湾，声援朝鲜人民正义的反侵略战争，将美帝国主义赶出亚洲去；他又号召美国工人、台湾工人弟兄们起来罢工、斗争；号召美国士兵认清真理，放下武器，不要为少数独占资本家卖命；全世界人民联合起来，保卫世界和平。
