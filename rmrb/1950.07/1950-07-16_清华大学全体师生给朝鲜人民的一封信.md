　　A Letter from All Teachers and Students of Tsinghua University to the Korean People

　　Brave Korean People:

　　The provocations of US imperialism and its lackey, the Li Seung-man gang, against the Korean people on Korean territory have once again exposed the hideous face of US imperialism and the consistent crimes of the Li Seung-man gang in betraying the interests of the people. But US imperialism, in the face of the great strength of the Korean people, is so flustered and defeated repeatedly, completely a paper tiger.

　　The anti-people US imperialist lackey Li Seung-man, this Korean Chiang Kai-shek, is following the old path of Chiang Kai-shek. Just as Chiang Kai-shek was defeated by the Chinese people, Li Seung-man will inevitably be defeated by you in the end. What the Li Seung-man puppet and the US imperialists launched is an unjust, anti-people war of aggression, while what you are waging is a just war of national liberation. From the very beginning of the war, you have shown unparalleled bravery. In half a month, you annihilated or routed six of Li Seung-man's entire eight divisions, killed and captured thousands of American soldiers, completely unable to stop your heroic advance! Victory will surely belong to you. We, the Chinese people, and all the people of the world who love justice, peace, and democracy, stand on your side. Our Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao, has already announced to the world on behalf of the people of the whole country: "The United States' interference in the internal affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc., is completely unreasonable. The sympathy of the entire Chinese people and the sympathy of the broad masses of people all over the world will stand on the side of the invaded, and will never stand on the side of US imperialism. They will neither be lured by the interests of imperialism nor fear the threats of imperialism. Imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak because it does not have the support of the people. The people of the whole country and the whole world unite to make full preparations to defeat any provocation by US imperialism." We also firmly believe in what your leader, General Kim Il-sung, said to you: "Our people's cause is just, and victory will surely belong to our people!"

　　Brave Korean people, advance bravely! The independence and unity you long for will surely be realized. Victory will surely belong to the Korean people! Victory will surely belong to the people of the whole world!

### 清华大学全体师生给朝鲜人民的一封信

　　清华大学全体师生给朝鲜人民的一封信英勇的朝鲜人民：
    美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮在朝鲜领土上对朝鲜人民的挑衅，又一次暴露了美帝国主义的狰狞面目，和李承晚匪帮一贯背叛人民利益的罪行。但美帝国主义在伟大的朝鲜人民力量面前，却是那样的张惶失措，屡战屡败，完全是个纸老虎。
    反人民的美帝国主义走狗李承晚，这个朝鲜的蒋介石，正走着蒋介石的旧路。像蒋介石被中国人民击败一样，李承晚最后也必定要被你们所击败。李承晚傀儡和美帝所发动的是非正义的，反人民的侵略战争，而你们所进行的则是正义的民族解放战争。在战争一开始，你们就表现出无比的英勇。李承晚全部八个师团的兵力，半个月就被你们歼灭或击溃了六个师团，美军成千的被你们打死和俘虏，完全不能阻挡你们的英勇进军！胜利一定是属于你们的。我们中国人民以及全世界爱好正义、和平、民主的人民，都是站在你们这一边的。我们中国人民的领袖毛主席已经代表全国人民向世界宣布：“美国对朝鲜、菲律宾、越南等国内政的干涉，是完全没有道理的，全中国人民的同情和全世界广大人民的同情都将站在被侵略者方面，而决不会站在美帝国主义方面。他们将既不受帝国主义的利诱，也不怕帝国主义的威胁。帝国主义是外强中干，因为它没有人民的支持。全国和全世界的人民团结起来进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”我们也确信你们的领袖金日成将军对你们说的话：“我们人民的事业是正义的，胜利是一定属于我们人民方面的。”
    英勇的朝鲜人民，奋勇前进吧！你们所渴望的独立统一一定会实现的。胜利是一定属于朝鲜人民的！胜利是一定属于全世界人民的！
