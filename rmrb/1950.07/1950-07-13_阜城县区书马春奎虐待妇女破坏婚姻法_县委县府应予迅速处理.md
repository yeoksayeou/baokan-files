　　Fucheng County District Secretary Ma Chunkui Abuses Women and Violates the Marriage Law
　　County Party Committee and County Government Should Handle It Promptly

　　Comrade Editor:
　　We are here to accuse a district cadre, Ma Chunkui, of abusing women and violating the Marriage Law. He is the former Secretary of the Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fucheng County, Hebei Province, before the reorganization, and is thirty-one years old. His wife, Xu Yulan, is twenty-five years old. They have been married for nine years and have three children. Ma Chunkui frequently abused Xu Yulan. At the end of December 1949, Chunkui applied to the county party committee for divorce. The county party committee did not understand his situation and approved his divorce. As a result, Chunkui returned home this spring and asked the village cadres Ma Chunling, Ma Chunming, and Ma Guangwu to propose a divorce to Yulan. Yulan did not agree. On the evening of March 2nd, Chunkui went home and started a quarrel with Yulan, using the excuse of borrowing wheat, and beat Yulan with a belt and shoe soles. Yulan was forced to agree to go to her parents' home to get wheat. But he still beat her while saying, "I must beat you to death! If you don't divorce, beating you to death will be the end of it!" As he said that, he took out a gun. Yulan was so scared that she knelt down and begged, "Tell me what to do, and I will do it, as long as you don't beat me to death." The next day, Yulan found Ma Chunling and the other two and told them about being beaten the previous night. Because Ma Chunkui was the district party secretary, the three of them dared not offend him, so they advised Yulan to divorce, promising to give Yulan two mu of land and let her pull more than two mu of wheat. In this way, Ma Chunkui and Yulan separated the next day. A few days later, Ma Chunkui, together with Ma Chunling and Ma Guangwu, went to the district government to go through divorce procedures. Although Secretary Zhao of the district government felt it was inappropriate for the woman not to be present, because Ma Chunkui was the district party secretary, he muddled through and wrote the divorce certificate, converting the two mu of land into 700 jin of grain. After returning home, Chunkui asked Xu Yulan to put her fingerprint on it. Ma Chunling and Ma Guangwu also deceived Yulan, saying, "This is a mediation agreement, just put your fingerprint on it. If you disagree later, it will be for nothing." Xu Yulan did not know the truth and was afraid of being beaten if she did not put her fingerprint on it, so she put her fingerprint on it. The next day, Xu Yulan took the "mediation agreement" to her parents' home and realized it was a divorce certificate. Yulan did not agree with this judgment and went to the district office to accuse him. However, the district office has been delaying solving this problem. On May 14th and 28th, Xu Yulan went to the county government twice to accuse Ma Chunkui of illegal acts. Because the whole county was holding a reorganization conference, and the subsequent changes in cadres, Xu Yulan's problem was not resolved. Ma Chunkui (who was determined to study after the reorganization) heard that Xu Yulan had accused him at the county government, and not only did he not give Yulan the wheat and land he had promised before, but he also wanted to take back the grain he had given to Xu Yulan in the past. Xu Yulan went to the County Public Security Bureau again on June 4th to accuse him. The Public Security Bureau introduced her to the court. However, the county court felt that this matter was related to the county's leading cadres and was not easy to solve, so it asked Xu Yulan to go home and wait for news. Until now, the problem has not been resolved, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.
　　Before the county-wide reorganization, the county party committee had heard some cadres and masses reflect on Ma Chunkui and had sent someone to investigate. However, because the seriousness of the problem was not fully recognized, it was not grasped tightly and was not resolved immediately. We suggest that the Fucheng County Party Committee and County Government should immediately deal with this problem, severely punish Ma Chunkui for this act of infringing on human rights, violating the Marriage Law, and seriously affecting the prestige of the Party and the government, and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

　　阜城县区书马春奎虐待妇女破坏婚姻法
    县委县府应予迅速处理编辑同志：
    我们在这里控诉一个虐待妇女破坏婚姻法的区干部——马春奎。他是河北省阜城县整编前的第八区的中共区委书记，年三十一岁。其妻许玉兰，年二十五岁。二人已结婚九年，已生三个小孩。马春奎经常虐待许玉兰。一九四九年十二月底，春奎向县委声请离婚，县委对他的情况并不了解，竟批准了他离婚。于是，春奎在今春回家就托村干部马春令、马春明、马光武三人向玉兰提出离婚。玉兰不同意。三月二日晚上，春奎就到家向玉兰寻衅，借口要一笔借来的麦子，用皮带、鞋底打玉兰。玉兰被迫答应到娘家去弄麦子。但他还是边打边说道：“非打死你不可！离婚不离了，打死你就算完了！”说着，便掏出枪来。玉兰吓的跪下哀求道：“你叫我怎么着，我就怎么着，只要不打死我就行。”第二天，玉兰就找到马春令等三人，把昨晚挨打情形告诉给他们。他们三人因为马春奎是区委书记，不敢得罪他，就劝玉兰离婚，允许给玉兰二亩地，并让她拔二亩多麦子。这样，马春奎和玉兰第二天就分了家。又过了几天，马春奎就和马春令、马光武共同到区政府办离婚手续。区政府赵秘书虽然觉得女方不来不合适，但因为马春奎是区委书记，就糊里糊涂的写了离婚书，并将二亩地折成七百斤粮食。到家后，春奎就让许玉兰按手印，马春令、马光武并欺骗玉兰说：“这是调解书，你盖上个手印吧。要是以后不同意，就算白写。”许玉兰不知道真情，又怕不盖手印还得挨打，就按上了手印。第二天许玉兰把“调解书”拿到娘家一看，才知是离婚书。玉兰不同意这样的判决，就到区公所控诉。但区公所对这个问题，一直拖延不解决。五月十四、二十八两日，许玉兰去县政府二次，控告马春奎的非法行为。因全县正开整编大会，以及会后干部的变动，所以对许玉兰的问题未解决。马春奎（整编后确定去学习）听到许玉兰到县政府控告后，不但以前允许给玉兰的麦子和地不给了，并要把过去给许玉兰的粮食也要回来。许玉兰在六月四日又到县公安局控告。公安局即将她介绍到法院。但县法院认为这事关系区领导干部问题，觉得不好解决，便又让许玉兰回家听信。直到现在，问题尚未得到解决，引起了群众的不满。
    在全县进行整编前，县委曾听到一些干部和群众对马春奎的反映，并曾派了专人进行过调查。但因对这一问题的严重程度认识不足，以致抓得不紧，没有立即加以解决。我们建议：阜城县委、县府应立即处理这个问题，对马春奎这种侵犯人权，违犯婚姻法、严重影响党和政府威信的犯法行为，加以严重处分，并将处理结果在报上公布。
