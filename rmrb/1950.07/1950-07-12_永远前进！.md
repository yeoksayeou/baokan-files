　　Always Forward!

        I.
    The electric lights illuminated the room, making it bright. The Party members of the Second Platoon were holding a group meeting. Zhao Wenqing, the group leader, stood up, fiddling with his notebook, and said seriously: "I want to convey an important matter, which is learning culture. The higher authorities have repeatedly instructed us to promote guaranteed teaching and learning, but our platoon is still being careless about it. This time, the branch's call is: illiterate Party members should be model learners, and literate Party members should be active teachers." As he spoke, he glanced around at everyone, then opened the page and added, imitating the words of the regiment's political commissar: "Communist Party members, be role models everywhere! Be heroes in battle, be models in learning. Whoever fails to learn 700 characters this year will be a backward element on the cultural front."
    "So what should we do?" someone suggested, "Let's count everyone in our platoon, figure out who should teach and who should learn, and divide it up!"
    Another person said, "I say it's not that simple, we should have a full discussion in the platoon first, and our Party members should set an example for others. Take me for example! I only know four hundred characters now, still far from enough! Especially our platoon leader, he only knows fifty-odd characters, he needs to work even harder!"
    People couldn't help but turn their eyes to Platoon Leader Li Jisheng. He only blinked once, his strong body remained motionless, his dark face shining. After a while, he said, as if taking a pre-battle oath: "Comrades, watch me, I will definitely work hard, like capturing prisoners, and memorize each and every new character in my heart. I only hope someone will teach me well!"
            II.
    Li Jisheng is an old platoon leader, no need to examine his history, the two hero medals on his chest will tell you: he is a fighting expert. But his "cultural level" is very low, some say he "doesn't recognize half a liter of characters as big as a dipper." In the past, his family was poor and couldn't afford to send him to school; he joined the army to turn the tables and get revenge. Mention fighting, and he would be overjoyed, but ask him to study, and he would droop his face, saying, "I'm already a rough old guy, how can I become refined? Being a soldier and fighting is enough!" So, for several years, he only learned fifty characters, including his own name.
    Around the New Year, there were rumors in the company that in 1950, illiteracy below 700 characters would be eliminated. The comrades were so happy that they jumped up and down, but Li Jisheng felt a drumming in his heart: "How can that be, counting seven hundred characters would take a long time! Learning, I wouldn't learn it even in the year of the monkey." After the New Year, the higher authorities really tightened their grip on cultural learning. The company also transferred in a cultural instructor, who took attendance in class, assigned homework after class, and you couldn't get away with not learning, there was always someone dragging you along.
    This new instructor was not easy to mess with, and would "checkmate" you at any opportunity. Li Jisheng suffered a lot. Once, the cultural instructor, with a happy smile, said to Li Jisheng: "Second Platoon Leader, a letter from home!"
    Li Jisheng said nothing and reached out to take it, but the cultural instructor put away his smile and said: "Want to see the letter? I'll give you a condition! You have to read it to me!"
    "Isn't this forcing a duck onto a perch!"
    "No! I'll teach you if you can't!"
    Li Jisheng was left not knowing whether to laugh or cry. In the end, he agreed to the cultural instructor's condition, read it through unclearly, and still didn't know what the letter said. He then studied with the cultural instructor for half an hour before the scene ended. Li Jisheng wiped his sweat and said, "Don't make things difficult for me anymore! I'll study hard!"
    Especially after the group meeting that day, Li Jisheng felt a thousand-pound weight pressing on his heart: How to learn? Who to find to teach me? He thought about this during the day, and even dreamed about it at night.
            III.
    Tomorrow is Friday. The Party group leader Zhao Wenqing thought to himself: "It's time to report to the branch secretary! The platoon leader still hasn't found a tutor? All this talk about Party members being role models, I think this time he'll be a 'model' of being backward again!" He went through the names of those with higher cultural levels in the platoon: Old Wang, from the South, with an unclear accent; Niu Shilin, serving as the economic committee member of the Soldiers' Committee, probably too busy…, after thinking about it, he thought of Zhang Jie, so he ran to find him.
    Zhang Jie was helping the villagers carry manure, Zhao Wenqing also joined in, pitching in while discussing with him: "Zhang Jie, you are also a Party member, what do you say about this learning matter? I think the platoon leader will fall behind the masses. You are well-educated, and you two spend a lot of time together, can you teach him? The platoon leader now has the desire to learn!"
    "Old Zhao! You are still the group leader! Your work is not thorough enough!" Saying that, Zhang Jie put down the iron shovel in his hand, took out a piece of paper from his pocket, and handed it to him, saying: "Putting up door gods on the fifteenth day of the first month - you're half a month late!"
    Zhao Wenqing opened it and saw that it was a contract for guaranteed teaching and learning. The penmanship was so neat! It read: "In order to fulfill the call of the higher authorities and the Party, and to eliminate illiteracy below 700 characters throughout the year, we two voluntarily sign this contract. Plan: 1. Combine daily work and learned subjects, and seize every opportunity to learn; 2. Learn three characters every day, ensuring the four skills (able to write, able to read, able to speak, and able to use); 3. You are the teacher, I am the student, I will respect you and obey your teachings when learning; 4. You are the learner, I am the teacher. I will teach you seriously and without laziness; 5. Jointly abide by the learning discipline, supervise each other, and if there is any violation of the contract, we are willing to accept criticism from the platoon and criticism within the Party. – Teacher: Zhang Jie. Learner: Li Jisheng."
    After reading it, Zhao Wenqing said with a smile: "Let's pass it at the platoon meeting soon – this way, everything will be easy. With the platoon leader setting an example as a Party member, hey! Our platoon's cultural learning will definitely be like our other work, dogs chasing ducks - quacking away."

　　永远前进！
    宋文茂
        一
    电灯光把房里照得白亮白亮。二班的党员们，正在开小组会。小组长赵文清站起来，手里摆弄着记事本，严肃地说：“我要传达一件重要的事情，就是学习文化。上级已经再三布置，叫推广包教保学，可是咱们班还二马一虎着呢。这次支部的号召是：文盲党员要作模范的保学者，不是文盲的党员要当积极的包教者。”说着，用眼轮了大家一周，然后翻开页纸，学着团政委的话补充说：“共产党员，处处做榜样！打仗当英雄，学习当模范。谁今年学不会七百字，那就是文化战线上的落后分子。”
    “那么怎么办呢？”有人提议说：“把咱们班的人，都数一遍，谁该包教，谁该保学，划分一下得啦！”
    另一个人说：“我说不那么简单，应该在班里再充分酝酿，咱们党员们先作个样给别人看。就说我吧！这会才识四百字，还差多呢！特别是咱们班长，才识五十多个字，更得加油！”
    人们不由的都把眼光投到班长李计声身上。他只眨了一下眼，粗壮的身体纹丝不动，一副黑呼呼的脸闪闪发亮。好一会，他才像当年战前宣誓似的说：同志们瞧着，我一定下苦工夫，像抓俘虏一样，把一个个生字记在心里。只希望有人好好包教我！”
            二
    李计声是老班长了，不用考究他的历史，他那胸前的两枚英雄奖章就会告诉你：他是打仗的能手。但是他“文化水”很浅，有人说他“斗大的字不识半升”。过去，家里穷，念不起书；入伍是为翻身报仇来的。一提作战，乐得他嗷嗷的，叫他学习，他就把脸皮一搭拉，说：“铸就的老粗啦，怎么变细？当兵打仗就行了呗！”所以好几年的工夫，连他自己的名字才学会了五十个字。
    过新年的时候，连里就有了风声，说一九五○年要消灭七百字以下的文盲。同志们听了高兴得乱蹦乱跳，可是李计声心里却敲起小鼓来：“那怎么行，七百字数也得数一大会啦！学，学到猴年上也学不了。”过了年，上级对文化学习真抓的紧了。连里又调来一个文化教员，上课先点名，下课留作业，不学也不成，总有人拖着你走。
    这个新来的教员可不好惹呀，抓空子就“将”你一“军”。李计声吃的苦头可不少。有一回，文化教员拿着一封信，喜眉笑脸地对李计声说：“二班长，家信！”
    李计声二话不说，伸手去接，文化教员却收起笑脸说：“想看信吗？讲个条件！你得念给我听！”
    “你这不是赶着鸭子上架呀！”
    “不！不会我教给你！”
    闹的李计声哭笑不得，最后依了文化教员的条件，不清不楚的念了一遍，还不知道信的内容是什么，又跟着文化教员学了半个钟头，这出戏才算结束。李计声擦把汗说：“以后别再难为咱了！好好学得啦！”
    特别是这天开过小组会以后，李计声心里就压上了千斤石：怎么学呢？找谁包教呢？白天想这个，黑夜作梦也是这个。
            三
    明天就是星期五。党的小组长赵文清心里想：“该向支书汇报啦！班长的包教人还没找呢？光说党员作模范，我看这回又倒数‘模范’啦！”班里文化程度高些的，都在他脑子里过了一遍：老王，南方人，口音不清；牛士林，担任着士兵委员会的经济委员，怕忙不过来……，想来想去，才想到张洁身上，于是拔起腿就去找他。
    张洁正帮老乡起粪，赵文清也凑过去，一面插手干，一面和他商量：“张洁，你也是个党员，你说这学习的事怎么着？我看班长还得落了群众的后。你文化高，你们作伴的时间也长，你能不能包教他？班长这会倒有了学习的心思啦！”
    “老赵！你还是小组长呢！工作太不深入啦！”说着张洁放下手里的铁锨，从口袋里掏出一张纸，递给他说：“正月十五贴门神——你晚了半月啦！”
    赵文清打开一看，原来是一份包教保学合同书。钢笔字多么工整啊！写的是：“为完成上级及党的号召，全年消灭识七百字以下的文盲，我俩自愿签订合同。计划：一、结合日常工作和所学课目，抓紧一切机会进行学习；二、每天学会三个字，保证作到四会（会写、会念、会讲、会用）；三、你是先生，我是学生，学习时我要尊敬你，服从你的教导；四、你是保学者，我是包教者。我要认真的教你，毫不偷懒；五、共同遵守学习纪律，互相监督，倘有违犯合同，愿受班内批评和党内批评。——包教者：张洁。保学者：李计声。”
    看完，赵文清笑眯眯地说：“快在班务会上通过吧——这一来，啥都好办啦。班长这党员一带头，嘿！咱们班的文化学习，一定和别的工作一样，狗赶鸭子——呱呱叫。”
                              （未完待续）
