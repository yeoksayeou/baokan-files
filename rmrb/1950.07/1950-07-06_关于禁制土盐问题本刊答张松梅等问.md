　　On the Issue of Prohibiting Homemade Salt: Our Publication's Response to Questions from Zhang Songmei and Others

　　To the Editorial Staff:

　　In some counties and districts of Hebei Province, farmers rely on boiling homemade salt (small white salt) for a living or as a sideline production. However, recently the government has prohibited the buying and selling of homemade salt. Does this comply with government policy? Also, in some areas of Leting County, the soil is highly alkaline and unsuitable for growing crops. The people have been boiling salt from the soil year after year. Now that boiling is prohibited, how will the people's production problems be solved?

　　Last year, due to severe famine, some local governments advocated boiling homemade salt to survive the crisis, which was necessary. However, later, in some areas, self-boiling for personal consumption developed into large-scale sales on the market. For example, the daily output of homemade salt in the coastal area of Tangshan District reached over 100,000 jin; the daily output of Liutan District in Yanshan County was 40,000 to 50,000 jin, which was sold to Leling, Hexi, and other counties. From a local perspective, this may provide some assistance to the people's lives, but it violates the national salt administration policy. Because a large amount of homemade salt floods the market, it will inevitably affect the state's fiscal revenue (salt tax has always been one of the main sources of state revenue; for every jin of homemade salt produced, the government loses one jin of salt tax), and hinder the legitimate business of salt merchants. At the same time, homemade salt itself contains a large amount of Glauber's salt, which is extremely harmful to health after consumption. On the other hand, the output of sea salt, pool salt, and well salt is sufficient for the people of the whole country to consume, and their cost is low and their quality is good. Therefore, the government has adopted a policy of prohibiting homemade salt.

　　In some areas of Hebei, some people rely on boiling homemade salt as their sole source of income or part of their income. If production is stopped immediately, they will not be able to maintain their lives. For these people, they should be temporarily allowed to apply for registration to continue production. However, the quantity of production, sales market, and date should be restricted, and taxes should be levied on a volumetric basis at 60% of the Tianjin sea salt tax rate. In most of these areas, the soil alkalinity is not strong, and it is not suitable for growing crops. Therefore, the local government should combine with the agricultural department to improve the soil quality of the salt fields, develop farmland, and strive to guide them to gradually change their professions within the next few years. Homemade salt producers in general disaster areas should strive to change their professions before the wheat harvest this year; individual disaster areas with special circumstances should be postponed to before the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. The active way to eliminate homemade salt production is to help the salt-boiling households and actively organize them to engage in other sideline production (fishing can be organized in coastal areas, and weaving can be organized in grass-producing areas), and improve the soil quality to facilitate the planting of crops (this is a longer process).

　　关于禁制土盐问题本刊答张松梅等问编辑同志：
    河北省有些县区农民，依靠熬制土盐（小白盐）为生，或当作副业生产。但最近政府禁止买卖土盐，这是否合乎政府政策？又如乐亭县某些地区土地，碱性很强，不适于栽种庄稼，老百姓成年以土熬盐。如今一旦禁止熬制，群众的生产问题如何解决？

    去年因灾荒严重，某些地方政府曾提倡熬制土盐度荒，这是必要的。但后来某些地区由自熬自食发展到在市场大批销售。如唐山分区沿海一带日产土盐即达十万斤以上；盐山县流潭区日产量为四、五万斤，销至乐陵、河西等县。从局部利益来看，这对群众生活虽稍有补助，但是违背了全国盐务的管理方针。因大批土盐涌进市场，将必然影响到国家的财政收入（历年来盐税是国家财政的主要收入之一；如多产一斤土盐，政府就要损失一斤盐税），妨害正当盐商的营业。同时土盐本身含有大量芒硝，食用后对身体健康极有害处。另一方面，海盐、池盐、井盐的产量足够全国人民食用，且其成本低、质量好。故政府对土盐采取禁制的政策。
    河北某些地区有些人以熬制土盐为生活的唯一来源或一部分来源，立即停制就无法维持生活，对于这种人，应暂准申请登记继续产制。但产制数量、销售市场及日期应受限制，并需照章按天津海盐税额百分之六十从量征税。这些地区的大部土地碱性不强，不适于栽种庄稼。因此地方政府应与农业部门结合，改良盐场土质，开拓农田，争取在最近几年内引导其逐步转业。一般灾区土盐产户应争取在今年麦收前转业；个别灾区情况特殊者，应酌情延至今年农历中秋节前停止产制。禁绝土盐生产的积极办法，是帮助熬盐户，主动组织他们进行其他的副业生产（沿海一带可以组织打鱼，产草区可组织编织等），并改良土质，以利农作物的栽种（这是一个较长的过程）。
