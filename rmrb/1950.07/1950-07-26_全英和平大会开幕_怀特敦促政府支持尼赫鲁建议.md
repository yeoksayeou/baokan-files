　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 24th: TASS reports: The All-England Peace Congress, organized by the British Peace Committee, opened in London on the 22nd. More than 900 representatives attended, representing various trade union branches, cooperatives, regional peace committees, and various working-class groups. Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, presided over the opening of the first meeting. Crowther called on the representatives to support the British Peace Committee, saying that this committee is the "general staff headquarters for the struggle for peace in Britain."

　　When the conference began its discussions, White, General Secretary of the Association of Civil Servants, said: Nehru's peace initiative has received a good response from the Soviet government, but the West has claimed that this is "another trick." White urged the British government to put forward a peace motion in the United Nations, and said that representatives have a responsibility to support Nehru's proposal and to do everything possible to fight for peace.

　　The famous British writer and member of the British Peace Committee, Aldridge, declared that he participated in the peace movement because of fervent belief. Referring to the massacre of peaceful Korean residents by American imperialists, Aldridge declared: "If I was not a member of the peace movement before, then I would join this movement now." The attendees responded to his words with applause.

　　全英和平大会开幕
    怀特敦促政府支持尼赫鲁建议
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国和平委员会组织的全英和平大会，已于二十二日在伦敦开幕。出席的代表有九百余人，代表各职工会分支，合作社，各地区的和平委员会和各种工人阶级的团体。英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟主持第一次会议的开幕。克劳瑟号召代表们支持英国和平委员会，他说，这一委员会是“英国争取和平的参谋总部”。
    大会开始讨论时，公务员协会总书记怀特说：尼赫鲁提出的和平倡议，获得了苏联政府的良好反应，然而，西方却声言说这是“又一套鬼把戏”。怀特促请英国政府在联合国提出和平动议，并说，代表们有责任支持尼赫鲁的建议，并且尽全部力量为和平而斗争。
    有名的英国作家、英国和平委员会委员阿尔德里琪宣称，他是因为热情的信念而参加了和平运动的。阿尔德里琪在谈到美国帝国主义者对朝鲜和平居民的屠杀时宣称：“如果我以前不是和平运动的一员，那末，我现在也要参加这一运动了。”与会者对他的话报以掌声。
