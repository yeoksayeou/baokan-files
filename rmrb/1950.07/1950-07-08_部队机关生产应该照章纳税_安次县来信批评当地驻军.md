　　Military Units' Production Should Pay Taxes According to Regulations
    Letter from Anci County Criticizes Local Garrison
Editor:
    The direct teaching brigade of a certain military unit stationed in Ge Yucheng Town, Third District of our county, opened a chicken hatchery this spring (as a unit-run production) and recently opened a coffin shop. When the first quarter of industrial and commercial tax was levied in April, the Ge Yucheng Tax Office, according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Tax Payment for Publicly Operated Enterprises promulgated by the Government Administration Council, sent personnel to negotiate the tax payment issue. However, it has been more than two months now, and the tax office has negotiated more than ten times without success. The unit consistently refuses to pay taxes, using excuses such as "no instructions from superiors" or "not yet requested instructions" each time they negotiate. We believe that such evasion and refusal to pay taxes is very wrong. We hope the editor will resolve this matter.
    Anci County Tax Office, Liu Wenkao
    Editor's Note: It is wrong for military units' production to not pay taxes. Please urge the leading organs of the local garrison to supervise the teaching brigade to pay taxes to the tax office according to regulations immediately.

### 部队机关生产应该照章纳税  安次县来信批评当地驻军

　　部队机关生产应该照章纳税
    安次县来信批评当地驻军编辑同志：
    驻在我县三区葛渔城镇的某军直属教导大队，今年春季在该镇开了个孵鸡房（系机关生产），最近又开了个棺材铺。四月份开征第一季工商业税时，葛渔城税务所根据政务院颁布的公营企业纳税暂行办法第三条的规定，派员前去交涉纳税问题，但是到现在已有两个多月了，经税务所十余次交涉均无效果。该部始终不肯纳税，每次交涉，均以“没有上级指示”或“尚未请示”等语敷衍搪塞。我们认为这种敷衍搪塞，不肯纳税的行为是很不对的。我们希望编者予以解决。
    安次县税务所  刘文考
    编者按：部队机关生产不纳税是不对的。请当地驻军领导机关督促该教导大队速向税务所照章纳税。
