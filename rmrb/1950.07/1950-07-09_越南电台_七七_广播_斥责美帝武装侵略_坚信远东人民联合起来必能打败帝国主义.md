　　Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the "Voice of Vietnam" radio station broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 7th, commemorating the anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan, entitled: "US Imperialism in the Far East is the Successor to Japanese Fascism." The broadcast pointed out the great historical lesson of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan, saying: Thirteen years ago, the Japanese warlords underestimated the power of the Chinese people who were not yet in power at the time. They launched a war and were defeated as a result. Thirteen years after the Lugou Bridge Incident and five years after the collapse of the Axis armies, everyone still remembers this lesson: No force can resist the power of a people determined to take up arms to defend their freedom. The Japanese fascists failed because they did not recognize this truth. The broadcast emphasized: If the new American fascists are still blinded by their greed for aggression and remain ignorant, then they will inevitably face the same fate in the eyes of the Asian people as their Japanese predecessors.
    The broadcast concluded: The people of the Far East firmly believe that by uniting and working together, they will surely crush the desperate struggle of dying imperialism.

　　越南电台“七七”广播
    斥责美帝武装侵略
    坚信远东人民联合起来必能打败帝国主义
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”广播电台在七日晚发表纪念中国人民抗日战争纪念日的广播评论，题目是：《美帝国主义在远东是日本法西斯主义的继承者》。广播指出中国人民抗日战争胜利的伟大历史教训说：十三年前，日本军阀低估了当时尚未执政的中国人民的力量。他们发动了战争，结果被打败了。在芦沟桥事变后十三年和轴心国军队溃败后也有五年的今日，大家对这个教训，记忆犹新：不论什么力量，都不能抗拒决心拿起武器维护他们自由的人民的力量。日本法西斯主义者所以遭到失败，是因为他们没有认识到这个真理。广播强调指出：如果美国新法西斯主义者今日仍为侵略的贪欲所迷，昏愦不悟，那么，他们必将在亚洲人民的面前，遭到像他们的日本前辈所遭遇的同样命运。
    广播最后称：远东人民坚决相信，他们联合起来共同努力，一定会粉碎垂死的帝国主义的绝望挣扎。
