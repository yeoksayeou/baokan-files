Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The Preparatory Committee of the Central-South General Labor Union was formally established at an enlarged meeting convened by the Preparatory Committee of the Central China General Labor Union. The original Preparatory Committee of the Central China General Labor Union was thereby dissolved. The enlarged meeting was held in Wuhan from the 11th to the 19th. At the meeting, Li Xuefeng, He Yingcai, and 42 others were elected as preparatory committee members, with Li Xuefeng as the director of the preparatory committee. The conference summarized the work of the past year and determined the tasks for the future.

In the past, labor union work in the Central-South region played a considerable role in promoting production. For example, in Guangxi, which had been liberated not long before, the labor union actively assisted the administrative side of public enterprises in promoting production, enabling several enterprises such as hydro-electricity, post and telecommunications to turn from losses to profits. Labor union organizations have also been generally established in various provinces and cities. There are already 500,000 members in the entire region, and more than 1.6 million workers maintain close contact with the labor union on a regular basis. In areas liberated for a longer period, such as Wuhan, industrial workers have been basically organized.

The meeting conducted a strict review of the shortcomings in the past labor union work in the Central-South region. The meeting pointed out that in the past labor union work, many labor union cadres did not clearly understand the point that "doing a good job in production is the key to doing a good job in all other work." Some labor union cadres in certain regions believed that promoting production in private enterprises would mean losing their position. In addition, the leadership structure of the labor union was not sound and did not penetrate to the lower levels, which considerably affected the work of promoting production. The meeting explicitly stated in its resolution that labor union work in the Central-South region in the future should focus on promoting production. The labor union should mobilize workers to carry out production competitions, cultivate model workers, and cultivate advanced production teams. Labor union cadres must go deep into the field, cultivate and promote the experience of advanced production teams.

　　中南总工会筹委会成立
    对过去工会工作中的缺点作了严格检讨
    【新华社二十三日讯】中南总工会筹备委员会已在华中总工会筹备委员会召开的扩大会议上宣告成立。原华中总工会筹委会就此宣告结束。扩大会议于十一日至十九日在武汉举行，会上选出李雪峰、何英才等四十四人为筹备委员，李雪峰为筹备主任。大会总结了过去一年来的工作，并确定了今后的工作任务。
    过去中南区工会工作，在推进生产上起了相当大的作用。如在解放不久的广西，工会积极协助公营企业的行政方面推进生产，使若干企业如水电、邮政、电信等，从亏本转到盈余。各省市并普遍建立了工会组织。全区已有五十万会员，另有一百六十余万工人，经常和工会取得密切联系。在解放较久的地区如武汉市，产业工人已基本上组织起来。
    会议对于过去中南区工会工作中的缺点作了严格检讨。会议指出：在过去的工会工作中，许多工会干部对于“作好生产是作好其他一切工作的关键”一点认识得不够明确。某些地区工会干部认为在私营企业中推动生产，会丧失立场。加上工会领导机构不健全，没有深入下层，推进生产的工作受到了相当的影响。会议在决议中明确提出今后中南区的工会工作，要以推进生产为中心。工会要发动工人开展生产竞赛，培养劳动模范，培养先进的生产小组。工会干部必须深入现场，培养和推进先进生产小组的经验。
