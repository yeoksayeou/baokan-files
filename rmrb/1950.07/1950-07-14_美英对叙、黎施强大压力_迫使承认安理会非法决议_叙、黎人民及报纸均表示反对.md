　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 11th (TASS): Sources here have learned that the diplomatic representatives of the United States and Britain have recently exerted strong pressure on the Lebanese government, attempting to force the latter to support the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council in favor of American armed intervention in Korea. The American and British ministers, Pickerton and Houston Boswell, recently paid a visit to the Lebanese Foreign Minister, during which they exerted particularly strong pressure on him. The purpose of this visit was to force the Lebanese government to abandon the position taken by Egypt on the Korean issue.
    From this, it can be seen that the British and American warmongers are using blackmail and intimidation to create a situation of "approval" for their aggressive actions in Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 9th (TASS): According to reports, the American minister to Syria recently put pressure on the Syrian Prime Minister, Kudsi, attempting to force the Syrian government to accept the Security Council's resolution on the Korean issue. At the same time, the American and British ministers in Beirut visited the Lebanese Foreign Minister and conducted negotiations on the Korean issue.
    However, Syrian and Lebanese newspapers insist that there should be no interference in the Korean affair and oppose the abusive pressure exerted by American imperialism. "Al Telegraf" stated: Lebanon must adopt the same attitude towards the Korean War as Egypt. Lebanon must not interfere in this affair and must not provide assistance. Only in this way can it stand at the forefront of peace.
    Syria's "An-Nahar" newspaper said: The aggression in Korea was approved by the Security Council, which used an illegal resolution to allow the United States to send air and naval forces to oppose a peaceful small nation striving for unification and liberation from foreign control. Under American pressure, the Security Council is helping to strengthen American control in the region. All Syrians resolutely protest the position taken by the Security Council, whose actions merely demonstrate that it is an appendage of the United States and a docile executor of American intentions.

　　美英对叙、黎施强大压力
    迫使承认安理会非法决议
    叙、黎人民及报纸均表示反对
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社开罗十一日讯：此间人士获悉，美国和英国的外交代表们，近来对黎巴嫩政府施以强大压力，欲迫使后者支持联合国安理会为赞成美国武装干涉朝鲜而通过的非法决议。美英两国公使皮凯顿和豪斯吞·波斯韦尔，最近一次访问黎巴嫩外交部长时，曾对他施以特别强大的压力。这次访问的目的，就是要迫使黎巴嫩政府放弃如埃及对朝鲜问题所采取的立场。
    由此可见，英美战争贩子们正用讹诈与恐吓的手段竭力要造成“赞成”他们在朝鲜侵略行动的一种局面。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特九日讯：据报载：美国驻叙利亚公使最近曾对叙总理库德西施用压力，企图迫使叙政府接受安理会关于朝鲜问题的决议。同时，美英驻贝鲁特公使访晤黎巴嫩外长，也进行了对于朝鲜问题的谈判。
    但叙利亚和黎巴嫩的报纸都坚持不应干涉朝鲜事件，并反对美帝国主义滥施压力。《电讯报》称：黎巴嫩对朝鲜战争必须采取和埃及同样的态度。黎巴嫩必须不干涉这一事件，并且必须不给予援助。只有这样，才是站在和平的前列。
    叙利亚的安·纳哈尔报说：在朝鲜的侵略是安理会所批准的，它用非法的决议允许美国派遣空海军来反对争取统一和求取自外国控制下获得解放的和平小民族。安理会在美国压迫下帮助加强美国在该地区的控制。所有叙利亚人都断然抗议安理会所采取的立场，安理会的所为仅仅表明它是美国的附庸和美国意图的驯服执行者。
