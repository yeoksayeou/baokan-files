　　Tang Mingyao Sacrificed His Life to Protect State Property

　　Comrade Tang Mingyao was a tax worker hired after the liberation of Wuhu in April 1949. He joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in April of this year and was a probationary member.

　　Over the past year, with the continuous help and education from the Party and the League, Comrade Tang Mingyao worked hard in his studies and consistently demonstrated a proactive and responsible attitude in his work. He was able to complete the tasks assigned to him by his superiors on time. He once single-handedly handled the tax collection work for five cigarette factories.

　　During the major floods in Wuhu last year, he was assigned to issue shipping permits at Changjie. Every day, he waded through more than half a kilometer of water back and forth, and could not eat on time, often eating cold food, but he never complained and continued to work happily. During his work, he never accepted any hospitality from manufacturers.

　　After dinner on May 29th, Comrade Tang Mingyao went to the cigarette factory to collect taxes. After collecting 753,000 yuan in taxes from the Jiangnan and Zhonghua factories, he returned to the tax bureau without delay. As he was walking to the People's Stadium in Wuhu City, not far from the tax bureau, a bandit suddenly threatened him with a gun to hand over the taxes, forcing him to turn into a small path. Comrade Tang Mingyao sternly refused and immediately fought the bandit empty-handed, shouting "Catch the robber!" Fearing that he would not be able to escape, the bandit shot Comrade Tang Mingyao in the lower abdomen and broke free. Comrade Tang Mingyao groped in the dark to pick up the tax money and ran back to the tax bureau with all his strength. As soon as he entered the door, he fell to the ground and was discovered by the doorman, who helped him inside. He gritted his teeth and told everyone the first sentence: "The tax money has not been robbed, it's still here." When his comrades asked him about the situation when he fought the bandit, he said with great indignation: "The bandit threatened me with a gun and asked me to hand over the tax money, forcing me to go with him. The tax money belongs to the people, I can't give it to him!" At this point, he was out of breath and could not continue, and closed his eyes. The tax bureau immediately rushed him to Wuhu People's Hospital for surgery. The next day (May 30), he died of excessive blood loss due to his serious injuries.

　　On June 12th, the Wuhu City Tax Bureau held a memorial meeting for Comrade Tang Mingyao, at which it called on everyone to learn from Comrade Tang Mingyao's revolutionary spirit of sacrificing his personal life to protect the people's property. The Wuhu City Committee of the Youth League also made a decision to posthumously recognize Comrade Tang Mingyao as an official member of the League and to launch a movement to learn from Comrade Tang Mingyao throughout the League.

　　为保护国家财产唐名耀牺牲了性命
    唐名耀同志是一九四九年四月芜湖解放后被录用的税工人员。今年四月参加中国新民主主义青年团，是候补团员。
    一年来，唐名耀同志在党和团不断的帮助教育下，努力学习，在工作中一贯表现积极负责。上级交给他的任务都能按期完成。他曾经一个人担任了五个烟厂的收税工作。
    去年芜湖大水期间，他被分配到长街填发运照，每天来回涉水一里多路，不能按时吃饭，经常吃冷饭凉菜，但他从不叫苦，仍然很愉快地工作着。在工作期间，他从不接受厂商的任何招待。
    五月二十九日晚饭后，唐名耀同志去烟厂收税款，在江南、中华两厂共收得税款七十五万三千元后，未曾停留即返税局。当他行至芜湖市人民体育场，离税局门前不远处，突有一匪特持枪威胁他交出税款，迫他折向小道随行。唐名耀同志严词拒绝，当即徒手奋身与匪特搏斗，并大喊“捉强盗”。该匪特恐不得脱身，即开枪击中唐名耀同志下腹后挣脱逃逸。唐名耀同志在黑暗中摸索着拾起税款，用尽力气跑回税局，刚进门便扑倒在地上，为门房传达发觉，扶至室内。他咬紧牙齿，第一句话就告诉大家：“税款没有被抢去，还在这里。”同志们询问他当时与匪特搏斗的情形，他愤恨万分地说：“匪特用枪威胁我，要我将税款交给他，逼我跟他走。税款是人民的，我不能交给他！”说到这里，他喘得说不下去了，闭上了眼睛。税局立即将他抬送芜湖市人民医院动手术，第二天（五月三十日）终因伤势过重流血过多而去世了。
    六月十二日芜湖市税局为唐名耀同志举行了追悼大会，在大会上号召大家学习唐名耀同志为保护人民财产而牺牲个人生命的革命精神。青年团芜湖市工委并作出决定：追认唐名耀同志为正式团员，在团内普遍展开学习唐名耀同志的运动。
