　　Streetcar Repair Factory Launches Production Competition
    All Workshops Exceed Early July Plan

    [Our Dispatch] A new record movement is unfolding enthusiastically at the Beijing Streetcar Repair Factory. All workshops have exceeded their production plans for early July. The electrician team exceeded its original plan by 37% in ten days. The factory's management committee studied the July production plan on June 21st. Subsequently, cadres at all levels went to each team to mobilize the workers to discuss and specifically formulate their own and the team's production plans. The award ceremony on June 30th further stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for production. After July 1st, new production records emerged continuously, such as the iron furnace room completing seven days' worth of work in four days. However, because the leadership only mobilized the teams to put forward their own guarantees and did not launch mutual challenges, everyone was just "working silently," failing to stimulate each other's production enthusiasm. In response to this situation, the trade union immediately convened a symposium of advanced producers, at which it was proposed to rely on advanced producers to overcome difficulties and do a good job in the new record movement. On the spot, everyone proposed changing the central slogan of "striving to complete the annual plan by the end of September" to "guaranteeing to complete the annual plan by the end of September." The woodworking team's electric planer broke down and would take thirteen days to repair. Foreman Shu Lianqing said, "We must overcome the difficulties and complete the task even without the electric planer!" This raised the atmosphere of the meeting. The electricians reported that they were actively preparing to launch challenges between groups and individuals. Everyone said that the track and civil engineering departments had launched challenges, and that the repair factory must strive for the red flag and definitely create a challenge upsurge. The long-brewing challenges between An worker Liu Mengxing and lathe worker Li Huaxin were put forward at the meeting. Zhang Zhiqing, foreman of the overhaul team, and Wang Naiquan, foreman of the welding team, also issued challenges. After the meeting, the trade union immediately issued a quick report, and propagandists went to the teams to carry out in-depth mobilization. The Jiache Baiye fourth shift first issued a challenge to the North Car Room and received the heroic response from the North Car Room. Individual challenges emerged continuously, starting with Liu Mengxing challenging Li Huaxin with the condition of exceeding the task by 50%. Liu Fulin, who previously thought that "odd jobs are not easy to challenge," also happily wrote a letter of response to Jiao Yaozong.

    In such a heat wave of competition, the riveting team not only realized the production slogan it put forward, but also delivered three car discs in ten days. The woodworking team's broken electric planer, which would have taken thirteen days to repair, was delivered three days ahead of schedule thanks to the efforts of the machining and An teams. Trainees from the cadre training class returned and said, "The factory is very different from before. Previously, activists did not dare to increase production on their own for fear of being detached from the masses. Now this concern is gone, and everyone is letting go and getting to work!" Deng Naicang and Li Zhanyuan, two young workers, also proposed to sign apprenticeship contracts with their masters.

    In this enthusiastic production competition, we have also gained the following insights:

    First, the rapid development of the new record movement is inseparable from propaganda and mobilization work. The propagandists study their work every other day, and the propagandists in each workshop played a major role from setting plans, putting forward slogans to launching challenges. For example, propagandist Zhang Zhiqing not only led his team to quickly put forward slogans, but also mobilized the materials section to put forward slogans. In addition, big-character posters, quick reports, good news reports, and challenge letters were issued in a timely manner and posted all over the factory, continuously raising the morale of the masses.

    Second, slogans and challenge conditions must be concise, vivid, popular, and specific, and the masses should be mobilized to put them forward based on their own shortcomings. This will enable the slogans to become widely popular and easily transformed into practical actions. The An team proposed "Down with those who only talk and don't practice, let's pull the line and see the work!" The overhaul team added "Genuine and affordable, no false advertising!" in front of the slogan, and it immediately spread throughout the factory. This time, when drafting the challenge words, many rhymes were compiled, which were widely welcomed by the masses.

    Third, launching challenge competitions is the best way to improve production morale. This time, the process of proposing slogans and launching challenges was divided into two stages, so after the slogans were put forward, the phenomenon of "working silently" occurred, and morale was not fully mobilized. Only after the challenges were launched did an upsurge arise.

    Fourth, at the beginning of the competition, the challenge conditions should not be set too high. This time, the first individual challenge proposed the condition of exceeding the task by 50%, which made workers with lower production capacity dare not propose it again, affecting the widespread development of the movement. This is a very important lesson.

### 电车修造厂展开生产竞赛  各车间均已超额完成本月上旬计划

　　电车修造厂展开生产竞赛
    各车间均已超额完成本月上旬计划
    【本报讯】京市电车修造厂新纪录运动正热烈展开，各车间均已超额完成了七月上旬的生产计划，电工班十天超出了原计划的百分之三十七。该厂管委会于上月二十一日就研究了七月份的生产计划。接着各级干部均纷纷到各班，发动工友讨论并具体制订自己和班的生产计划。六月三十日的发奖大会，更激发了职工们的生产热情。“七一”之后，生产新纪录不断涌现，如铁炉房四天就完成了七天的任务。但由于领导方面只动员了各班提出自己的保证，没有发动相互的挑战，大家只是在“闷头干”，未能互相激发生产热情。根据这种情况，工会立即召开了一个先进生产者座谈会，在会上提出依靠先进生产者克服困难，搞好新纪录运动。当场大家提出把“争取九月底完成全年计划”的中心口号改为“保证九月底完成全年计划”。木工班坏了电刨，要十三天才能修好。领班舒连青说：“我们一定要克服困难，不用电刨也要完成任务！”这一来，提高了会场情绪。电工报告说，他们正在积极准备展开组与组、人与人的挑战。大家都说车路、土木课都把挑战搞起来了，修造厂要争红旗，一定也要把挑战热潮搞起来。酝酿已久的案工刘梦星和旋工李华鑫的挑战，在会上提了出来。大修班领班张治清和电焊班领班王乃全也挑了战。会后，工会立刻出了快报，宣传员到班里深入动员。架车白夜四班首先向北车房下了挑战书并得到了北车房的英勇应战。个人挑战从刘梦星以超过任务百分之五十的条件向李华鑫挑战开始，连续不断地涌现出来。以前认为“零活不好挑战”的刘福林，现在也兴高彩烈地给焦耀宗写了应战书。
    在这样竞赛的热潮中，铆工班不但实现了自己提出的生产口号，而且十天交了三个车盘，木工班坏掉的电刨，本来十三天才能修好，经过机工、案工两班的努力，提前三天交了活。干训班受训的学员回来说：“厂子和从前大不相同了，以前积极分子不敢独自提高生产，怕脱离群众，现在这种顾虑没有了，大家都放手干起来了！”邓乃仓、李占元两个青工，也提出和师傅订立师徒合同的要求。
    在这样热烈的生产竞赛中，我们还得到了以下几点体会：
    首先，新纪录运动的迅速开展，和宣传鼓动工作是分不开的。宣传员隔一天研究一次工作，从订计划、提口号到展开挑战，各车间宣传员起了很大作用。例如宣传员张治清不但带动本班迅速提出口号，还动员材料课提出口号。此外，大字报、快报、喜报、挑战书出得及时，贴满了厂房，使群众情绪不断地上升。
    二、口号和挑战条件必须简明，生动，通俗，具体，发动群众根据自己缺点来提，这样才能使口号广泛流行，易于变成实际行动。案工班提出“打倒光说不练，咱们拉线瞧活！”大修班在口号前面加上“货真价实，不作虚伪宣传！”一下子就传遍全厂，这次在拟挑战词时，编了许多顺口溜，受到群众普遍欢迎。
    三、开展挑战竞赛是提高生产情绪的最好方法。这次把提口号和发动挑战分成两个阶段，因此口号提出后，发生“闷头干”的现象，情绪没有充分发动起来，发起挑战后，才掀起了热潮。
    四、竞赛开始时，挑战条件不要提得过高。这一次第一个个人挑战，就提出超过任务百分之五十的条件，使生产能力较低的工人不敢再提，影响了运动的普遍开展。这是一个很重要的教训。
