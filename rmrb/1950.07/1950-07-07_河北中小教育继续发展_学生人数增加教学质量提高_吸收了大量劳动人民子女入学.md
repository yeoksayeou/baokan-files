　　Hebei's secondary and primary education continues to develop.
    Student enrollment increases, teaching quality improves.
    A large number of children of the working people are admitted to schools.
    [Baoding Dispatch from this newspaper] In Hebei Province, secondary and primary education has continued to develop this year; the proportion of children of the working people among students has also increased compared to the past. The province currently has one Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School, 41 provincial, municipal, and county-run secondary schools, 137 normal schools, and 12 private secondary schools, with a total of 51,326 students (figures for nine schools are missing). Compared to last year, one Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School and 11 normal schools have been added; the number of students has increased by 8,040 compared to last winter (figures for 13 schools are missing). During the spring enrollment, all schools paid attention to implementing the policy of "opening the door to workers and peasants," providing various possible considerations for the children of workers and peasants. Children of the working people now account for 87.55 percent of the students, an increase of 6.84 percent compared to last winter. Public secondary schools in industrial and mining areas such as Shijiazhuang and Tangshan have attached supplementary after-work secondary school classes and workers' night schools, and some have organized student service teams to conduct workers' cultural and educational work in factories on a rotating basis. Teachers have also been strengthened and adjusted, and the in-service teachers' studies have been enhanced, resulting in a significant improvement in teaching staff. Normal schools have generally conducted professional ideological education; ordinary secondary schools have also provided ideological guidance on students' further education and employment issues. Many schools have paid attention to correcting the idea of not valuing political education and the phenomenon of laxity, improving the living system, and some schools have also carried out after-school labor production.
    In terms of primary education, the number of enrolled children has generally increased, except in severely disaster-stricken areas. According to statistics from eight counties in the Shijiazhuang and Baoding areas and the Tangshan area, there was an increase of 96,495 people; the three cities of Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Qinhuangdao increased by 12,761 people. The increased number of enrolled children are mostly children of workers and peasants. In non-disaster areas, the focus of primary education work is to improve the teaching staff, improve teaching, and summarize the experience of education work. Since the establishment of Hebei Province, the Department of Education has organized more than 2,000 urban intellectuals to go to the countryside to serve as primary school teachers or administrative cadres. Most of them are able to work actively. Many regions have established learning organizations for primary school teachers based on central school districts or complete primary schools to promote teacher learning and strengthen lesson preparation. Some regions have adopted methods such as demonstration teaching, teachers listening to each other's lessons, and organizing visits to improve teaching methods. Some teachers have been able to conduct political and ideological education by connecting with students' actual lives through various subject teachings and activities to cultivate students' "Five Loves" public morals. In the primary education of the disaster area, the policy of combining production and disaster relief, preserving teachers, and preserving schools has been adhered to. During the severe famine, many schools were closed and the number of students decreased. After the government emphasized the combination of education and production for disaster relief, promoted and rewarded the teachers' spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses and working hard, and allocated the necessary funds for subsidies, most of the closed schools have been restored. For example, in the Tianjin area, there were 3,068 primary schools before the disaster, which decreased to 2,299 after the disaster, and by May had recovered to 2,688; in the Tangshan area, there were 4,325 primary schools before the disaster, and by May had recovered to 4,152, and the number of students had increased by 43,303 compared to before the disaster. At the same time, the government organized primary school teachers' training classes on a rotational basis to preserve the teaching staff. According to statistics from 81 counties, 4,303 teachers participated in the rotational training. This has reserved strength for the future restoration of primary education in disaster areas and the development of education throughout the province. (Wu Tao)

　　河北中小教育继续发展
    学生人数增加教学质量提高 
    吸收了大量劳动人民子女入学
    【本报保定讯】河北省的中、小学教育，本年来续有发展；学生中的劳动人民子女成份亦较前增加。全省现有工农速成中学一所，省、市、县立中学四十一所，师范学校一百三十七所，私立中学十二所；共有学生五万一千三百二十六名（内缺九校数字）。较去年增加了工农速成中学一所，师范学校十一所；学生较去冬（缺十三校数字）增加了八千零四十名。春季招生中，各校均注意执行了“向工农开门”的方针，给工农子女以各种可能的照顾。学生中劳动人民子女已占百分之八十七点五五，较去冬增加了百分之六点八四。石家庄、唐山等工矿区的公立中学，有的并附设了工余中学班及工人夜校，有的组织了学生服务队，轮流到工厂去开展工人文教工作。教员方面亦曾加以充实和调整，加强了在职教员学习，师资已有显著提高。师范学校一般都进行了专业思想教育；普通中学对学生升学就业问题也多进行了思想指导。不少学校注意纠正了不重视政治教育的思想和散漫现象，健全了生活制度，有的学校并进行了课余劳动生产。
    在小学教育方面，除重灾区外，入学儿童普遍增加，据石家庄专区和保定专区的八个县与唐山专区统计，即增加了九万六千四百九十五人；唐山、石家庄、秦皇岛三个市增加了一万二千七百六十一人。增加的入学儿童多为工农子女。在非灾区，小学教育工作的重点是提高师资、改进教学和总结教育工作经验。自河北省建省以来，教育厅前后组织了二千余城市知识分子下乡充任小学教师或行政干部。他们中大多数均能积极工作。很多地区以中心学区或完小为单位建立了小学教员的学习组织，以推动教员学习并加强教课的准备。有的地区则采用了示范教学、教员互相听课、组织参观等方法来改进教学方法。部分教员已能通过各科教学及各种活动，联系学生实际生活来进行政治思想教育，以培养学生的五爱公德。在灾区的小学教育，坚持了与生产救灾相结合，保存教师，保存学校的方针。在灾荒严重时，曾有很多学校停办，学生人数减少；经政府强调提出教育与生产救灾相结合，发扬、奖励教员与群众同甘共苦，艰苦奋斗的作风，并拨给必要的经费补助之后，停顿的学校已大部恢复。如天津专区灾前有小学三千零六十八处，灾后减至二千二百九十九处，至五月份已恢复到二千六百八十八处；唐山专区灾前有小学四千三百二十五处，至五月份已恢复到四千一百五十二处，学生则比灾前还增加了四万三千三百零三人。同时，政府以组织小学教员轮训班来保存师资，据八十一县统计，参加轮训的教员达四千三百零三人。为今后恢复灾区小学教育与发展全省教育储备了力量。（吴韬）
