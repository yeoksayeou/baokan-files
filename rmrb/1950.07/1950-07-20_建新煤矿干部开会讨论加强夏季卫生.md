　　Jianxin Coal Mine Cadres Hold Meeting to Discuss Strengthening Summer Hygiene
    [Our Dispatch] It is summer, the season when infectious diseases are rampant. The government has repeatedly called on all levels of organizations to launch a universal hygiene campaign. Under the arrangement and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the Jianxin Coal Mine in Beijing has actively launched it. On the 7th of this month, the factory held a meeting of all trade union cadres and Party and Youth League members from the two pits to exchange opinions and decided that the cadres should take the lead. That afternoon, dozens of cadres, carrying cleaning tools and medicines, went to various cooking groups and dormitories to check environmental hygiene, point out the advantages and disadvantages at any time, and conduct publicity and education. After this mobilization, everyone had a further understanding of the significance and importance of the hygiene campaign.
