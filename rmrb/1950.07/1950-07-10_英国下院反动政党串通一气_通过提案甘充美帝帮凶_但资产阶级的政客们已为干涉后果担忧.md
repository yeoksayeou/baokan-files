Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The British House of Commons debated the Korean issue on the 5th. The debate was conducted with the collusion of the Labour government and the Conservative and Liberal parties. Before the meeting, British Prime Minister Attlee threatened his Labour members, saying, "Any Labour member who disagrees with the United Nations' armed intervention in the Korean incident should be prepared to be expelled." Nevertheless, several Labour MPs attacked the British government's policy on the Korean incident in their speeches. Labour MP Davies criticized the British government for "blindly following the Americans" and suggested that British warships should withdraw from the Korean waters. He said, "If it weren't for America's unprovoked aggression, this war would have ended in about a week." Davies's suggestion was supported by another Labour MP, Hughes, who said, "If we join this war, we will be against three-quarters of the world." During the debate, several women in the audience shouted "Do not interfere in Korea" and threw leaflets against interfering in Korea's internal affairs at the MPs' seats and journalists' seats.

However, due to the unusual "unanimity" of the vast majority of Labour members with Conservative and Liberal MPs in the affair of interfering in the Korean people's war of liberation, the House of Commons finally passed the Labour government's proposal, announcing its support for the Labour government's policy of following American imperialism's illegal interference in Korea's internal affairs. In the debate, Labour leader Morrison used his unique "logic" to say that if he did not participate in the intervention in Korea, it would be "tantamount to Britain withdrawing from the United Nations." Churchill, in his speech, completely exposed that the Labour government was essentially the same as the Conservative Party. He said: "If our Conservative Party were in power, when we received the news of Truman's action, our actions would most likely be exactly the same as those taken by the current government." Liberal Davis repeated the hackneyed slander of the Soviet Union.

However, while bourgeois politicians were playing the "armed intervention grand chorus," they also revealed their fear of the consequences of this shameful intervention. In his final speech, Conservative Eden, in addition to worrying that the Korean incident would be a "time-consuming and laborious affair," also expressed the British ruling class's distress, saying, "If Britain is reasonably willing to express sympathy in Korea, but dangerously weakens its defenses in Malaya, that would be extremely foolish."

　　英国下院反动政党串通一气
    通过提案甘充美帝帮凶 
    但资产阶级的政客们已为干涉后果担忧
    【新华社九日讯】英国下院于五日辩论朝鲜问题。辩论是在工党政府与保守党、自由党等串通之下进行的。英首相艾德礼在会前就恐吓其工党党员说：“任何工党党员，如果他不同意联合国武装干涉朝鲜事件的话，均准备予以开除”。虽然如此，仍有若干工党议员在发言中攻击英国政府对朝鲜事件的政策。工党议员戴维斯批评英国政府“盲目地追随美国人之后”，并提议英国战舰应自朝鲜海面撤退。他说：“要不是美国的无故侵略行为，这场战争大约一星期内早就结束了”。戴维斯的建议获得另一个工党议员休士的支持，休士说：“假使我们加入这个战争，我们就要和全世界的四分之三作对。”在辩论进行中，旁听席上有妇女数人高呼“不要干涉朝鲜”，并向议员席和记者座位抛掷反对干涉朝鲜内政的传单。
    但是，由于绝大多数的工党分子与保守党、自由党的议员们在干涉朝鲜人民解放战争的勾当上异乎寻常的“一致”，下院最后通过了工党政府的提案，宣布赞成工党政府追随美帝国主义非法干涉朝鲜内政的政策。在辩论中，下院工党领袖莫里逊运用他特有的“逻辑”，竟说假使不参加干涉朝鲜，就“不啻说英国退出联合国了”。邱吉尔在他的发言中，完全暴露了工党政府在实质上和保守党一样。他说：“如果我们保守党当政，当我们一得到杜鲁门采取行动的消息时，我们的行动也极可能和现在政府所采取的行动完全相同”。自由党的戴维斯则重复诽谤苏联的滥调。
    但是，资产阶级政客们在演奏“武装干涉大合唱”之余，还流露了他们对这种可耻干涉的后果的恐惧。保守党的艾登在最后发言中，除了忧虑朝鲜事件将是一件“费时费力的事情”外，他还道出了英国统治阶级的苦闷，他说：“如果英国在朝鲜方面固然合理地愿意表示同情，而在马来亚的防线上却危险地削弱了自己，那就是愚蠢之极了。”
