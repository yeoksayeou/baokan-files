　　Brief Account of the Work of the Chinese World Peace Preservation Propaganda Group
    The peace signature campaign, called for by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, unfolded in the new China in early May and received an enthusiastic response and unanimous support from the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas. In order to convey the resolution of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress on banning atomic weapons, and to further promote the publicity work of preserving world peace in various parts of our country, the Chinese Committee for the Preservation of World Peace organized the Chinese World Peace Preservation Propaganda Group in late May to travel to various places for propaganda, and at the same time to understand the organization and work of local branch associations.

    The Chinese World Peace Preservation Propaganda Group was composed of representatives from the Chinese People's Association for World Peace and Against Aggression, the Sino Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, and national literary, women's, youth, and student federations. Xiao San, the representative of the Chinese People's Association for World Peace and Against Aggression who attended the Stockholm meeting, was the head of the group, and the members included Zhao Zhongchi, Ai Qing, Bai Yun, Huang Zhensheng, and others. They departed from Beijing on May 24 and returned to Beijing on July 5, spending a total of forty-two days on the road.

    The group successively conveyed the resolutions and calls of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and Against Aggression in eight cities including Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Changsha, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an, and carried out various forms of propaganda work in these places, such as participating in mass rallies for the preservation of world peace and large and small forums for representatives from all walks of life, showing films promoting the preservation of world peace, and broadcasting speeches on the significance of the signature campaign on the radio. Sometimes a member of the group had to give three or more speeches in a single day, making the work extremely tense and busy. In total, the propaganda group participated in 104 rallies and various forums in forty-two days, with a total audience of more than 161,000 people; screened more than 50 films promoting the preservation of world peace, with an audience of more than 150,000 people; and made eleven radio speeches.

    Due to the people's love and support for world peace in various places, the work carried out by the propaganda group in various places achieved certain results. After in-depth publicity and explanation work, a number of ideological problems of the masses were resolved. The masses in various places have taken a step forward in their understanding of internationalism, and they have further understood the significance of the signature campaign, thus further promoting and expanding the peace signature campaign in various places.

    In the propaganda work, the group was able to change the content of the propaganda at any time according to the different times, places, and objects, so that the masses could solve ideological ambiguities and express them in action, thereby improving their understanding. Special attention was paid to primary and secondary school teachers and students in the propaganda objects, because through them, it is easier to carry out propaganda and education to unorganized masses.

    Experience has proved that the organization of this type of propaganda group is of great help to the work in various places, and the Peace and Anti-Aggression Committee hopes that large cities in major administrative regions can also organize their own propaganda groups to carry out propaganda work in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas.

　　中国保卫世界和平宣传团工作简述
    世界拥护和平大会常委会所号召的和平签名运动，五月初在新中国展开后，得到城乡广大人民积极的响应与一致拥护。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会为传达世界拥护和平大会常委会斯德哥尔摩会议关于禁用原子武器的决议，并更进一步推进我国各地保卫世界和平的宣传工作起见，特于五月下旬组织了中国保卫世界和平宣传团，赴各地作旅行宣传，同时了解各地分会组织及工作情况。
    中国保卫世界和平宣传团由中国和大、中苏友协总会和全国文联、妇联、青联、学联等团体的代表组成，以代表中国和大出席斯德哥尔摩会议的萧三为团长，团员有赵仲池、艾青、白芸、黄振声等。于五月二十四日由北京出发，七月五日返京，共在途中四十二天。
    该团曾先后在南京、上海、杭州、广州、长沙、武汉、郑州、西安等八个城市传达了世界和大常委会的决议和号召，并紧张地在各地进行了各种方式的宣传工作，如参加各地的保卫世界和平群众大会和各界代表的大、小型座谈会，放映宣传保卫世界和平的电影，在电台播讲签名运动的意义。有时一个团员在一天中要讲演三次以上，工作极为紧张繁忙。总计宣传团在四十二天中，共参加大会和各种座谈会一百零四次，各界听众达十六万一千多人；放映宣传保卫世界和平的电影五十余场，观众在十五万人以上；在电台作了十一次广播演讲。
    由于各地人民对世界和平的热爱与拥护，使宣传团在各地所进行的工作获得了一定的成绩。在经过深入的宣传解释工作后，解决了群众的若干思想问题。使各地群众对国际主义的认识提高了一步，使他们进一步了解了签名运动的意义，因而把各地的和平签名运动更加推向深入和扩大。
    该团在宣传工作中，能因时、因地、因对象的不同，而随时改变宣传内容，使群众能解决了思想上模糊的问题，以行动表现出来，从而提高了认识。在宣传对象中特别注重中小学教师及学生，因为通过他们，比较容易向无组织的群众进行宣传教育。
    经验证明，这一类宣传团的组织，对各地工作的帮助很大，和大委员会希望各大行政区中的大城市，也能自行组织宣传团，到各中小城市及农村中进行宣传工作。
