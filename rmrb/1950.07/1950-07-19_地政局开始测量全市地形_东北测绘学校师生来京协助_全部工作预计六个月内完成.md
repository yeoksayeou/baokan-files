　　Land Administration Bureau Begins Surveying City Topography
    Teachers and Students from Northeast Surveying and Mapping School Come to Beijing to Assist
    All Work Expected to Be Completed Within Six Months
    [This Newspaper's dispatch] In the past, Beijing conducted surveys for boundary maps covering more than 400 square kilometers, but due to irregular measurement methods and careless work, there were many errors. The Beijing Land Administration Bureau has decided to re-conduct primary triangulation and leveling surveys in the suburbs to create a 1:1000 topographic map of the entire city. Leveling surveys began in May. Primary triangulation belongs to the scope of geodetic surveying, including astronomy, observation, baseline measurement, etc., which requires high technology and precise instruments. In order to complete this surveying task as quickly as possible, the Land Administration Bureau specifically requested the Central Bureau of Surveying and Mapping to transfer teachers and students from the Northeast Surveying and Mapping School to assist with the work. More than 50 teachers and students from the school arrived in Beijing from Shenyang on June 27. The entire work is expected to be completed within six months.

    【本报讯】京市过去曾施测四百多平方公里界址图，但因测量方法不正规，工作草率，错误很多。京市地政局决定重新在郊区作主干三角测量及水准测量，以便测绘全市千分之一地形图。水准测量已于五月份开始进行；主干三角测量属于大地测量范围，包括天文、观测、基线测量等，需要高度的技术与精密的仪器。地政局为从速完成此项测量任务，特洽请中央测绘局抽调东北测绘学校师生协助工作。该校师生五十余人，已于六月二十七日由沈阳抵京。全部工作预计六个月完成。
