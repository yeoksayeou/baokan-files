　　Central South People's Broadcasting Station Trains Radio Operators in Batches
    [This newspaper report] The Central South People's Broadcasting Station is mobilizing all its forces and actively preparing to complete the establishment of a universal radio network throughout the region before October. The station has determined to begin training radio operators from various counties in Hubei Province on July 15th, with a training period of half a month. Radio operators from various counties in Henan Province will be trained starting August 5th. The Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station in the region is also preparing to train radio operators from various counties in Guangdong Province in July and August. At the same time, the Central South People's Station is striving to establish the Kaifeng People's Broadcasting Station before October and increase the power output of the Central South Station. In order to assist provinces, cities, and counties within the region in establishing radio networks, the station has ordered 1,200 AC/DC radios from the People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory. Recently, the station issued a notice to provincial stations in the region to urge them to actively carry out radio network work. The notice emphasized: "Each provincial station should regard the establishment of a radio network as the central task of this year's station construction and development of broadcasting, and must fully estimate that after the radio network is established, a brand-new situation will appear in the broadcasting industry throughout the Central South region."
    The Central South Military Region is also preparing to transfer a group of cadres from the troops to participate in radio operator training, so that they can be assigned to various regiments to serve as radio operators. The Central South People's Station is also studying and improving special programs for the People's Liberation Army broadcasts.
