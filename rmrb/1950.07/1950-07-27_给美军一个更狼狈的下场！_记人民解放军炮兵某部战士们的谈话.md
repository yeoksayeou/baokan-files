　　Give the American Army an Even More Humiliating End!
　　Notes from a Conversation with Soldiers of a Certain Artillery Unit of the People’s Liberation Army
　　By Our Correspondent Mu Yang
　　The victorious advance of the Korean People's Army has aroused boundless joy and respect within the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The soldiers unanimously believe that the victory of the fraternal country's army and the disastrous defeat of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee puppet army are a re-enactment of the American imperialists' and Chiang Kai-shek bandits' disastrous defeat on the Chinese mainland, and a mirror reflecting the imminent defeat of American imperialism in Taiwan. On the evening of the 19th, during my visit to soldiers of a certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army, the soldiers used their personal experiences to illustrate this truth.
　　The soldiers I visited this time were all heroes who had directly fought against the American interventionist forces in the early stages of the War of Liberation. Wang Fengming, a hero who was gloriously wounded and awarded a special-class merit for his contributions to the people in the Siping Campaign in 1946, first told me about the ugly behavior of the American aggressors in that campaign: At that time, there were three American military advisors in each battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, as well as many American supervising soldiers. In one battle, our army attacked a village near the East Camp. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army was defeated, the American soldiers panicked and ran away, throwing away their automatic rifles. Some who understood a little about Chinese customs ran to the women's toilets, and one climbed into a farmer's wardrobe, thinking that the People's Liberation Army would not be able to catch them. But they didn't escape and were all found and obediently taken prisoner. A commander wearing gold-edged epaulettes was so frightened that he could not stand still and hugged a small tree, trembling all over. Comrade Wang Fengming's vivid performance often caused loud laughter among the heroes.
　　Hu Liansheng, the security officer, participated in the Anping battle in eastern Hebei in 1946. At that time, a group of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops wanted to go to Beijing from Tianjin through the liberated area, but they were afraid of being annihilated and dared not go. The American soldiers shamelessly thought that the People's Liberation Army was afraid of them, so they came out in cars to pave the way for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Hu Liansheng and his brothers encountered the American soldiers near Anping, and a battle broke out. Hu Liansheng and his brothers rushed to the American soldiers. The American "young masters" had not yet prepared to lie down, and were busy laying blankets on the ground. Some were frightened, and our soldiers took automatic rifles from their necks, and they realized that they were prisoners. "The American soldiers are all very tall, with an automatic rifle each. Before entering the battle, some of our soldiers were indeed a little unsure of their strength. After the battle, they all came to another conclusion that they have not forgotten to this day: Western goods (the American army) are easier to fight than Eastern goods (the Japanese invaders)!"
　　Then, Jia Zhanyuan, the company commander of the Third Company, and soldiers Wang Zhulin, Dou Lianyun, and Zhang Yaojun also successively narrated the stories of the American army attacking us in Zunhua, Changli in eastern Hebei, Dahushan and Shanhaiguan in the northeast. The American army's shameful defeat and "disgusting surrender posture" were replayed in these places.
　　"Why is the American imperialist army so weak?" This was the second topic of the heroes. After everyone listed the weaknesses of the American army, special-class meritorious Wang Fengming recounted a story from the Dahushan incident that year.
　　In the Dahushan sniper battle, they captured a dozen invading American soldiers. Although these soldiers still looked down on the People's Liberation Army, they were somewhat afraid when they became prisoners, crying and giving the People's Liberation Army cigarettes, writing letters, and saluting. One of our soldiers found a translator and asked them, "Why did you come to fight the Chinese people?" They all said, "I don't know, it was the order of the superiors to fight." In the end, they repeatedly said that they all wanted to live and hoped to be forgiven. This made our soldiers both angry and disgusted.
　　"Think about it, such an army, with an unjust cause, serving as an tool of aggression for a few financial oligarchs and imperialists, how can it not be defeated!" Comrade Jia Zhanyuan's conclusion is exactly what every hero has realized, and it is also the destined fate of the American aggressor army in Korea. Therefore, the heroes are also full of confidence in the victory of the Korean People's Army. Wang Zhulin said: "I know how the Chinese civil war started and how the Chinese people won. I also understand how the Korean war started and how the Korean people will win." The history that the imperialism headed by American imperialism has repeatedly repeated in China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya and other places after World War II has made every one of our soldiers understand this truth. Hu Liansheng said: "When the American imperialists sent troops to Korea, some kind-hearted comrades said: Korean People's Army brothers, don't let them scare you, beat them hard, and they won't dare to bite you again! Now everyone says: The Korean People's Army is really our good brother!" Hu Liansheng patted his chest and gave a thumbs up.
　　The victory of the Korean People's Army has also greatly encouraged the heroes' confidence in liberating Taiwan. Wang Fengming said: "The American army, navy, and air force are all made from the same mold: such a large cruiser was sunk by the People's Army's few torpedo boats, and so many jet and B-29 aircraft have been shot down. No matter what the Seventh Fleet comes to make trouble, we will still liberate Taiwan. The only question is that we should prepare better so that we can completely eliminate the enemy on the seabed! Give them an even more humiliating end!" This is the unanimous belief of the heroes. Therefore, what everyone is talking about is not whether Taiwan can be liberated, but how to liberate Taiwan and how to support the brother troops who are liberating Taiwan.
　　The conversation was about to end, and someone handed me many letters of condolence written to the Korean People's Army. These were sent by soldiers of another PLA unit about twenty miles away, braving the rain.
　　"Korean People's Army brothers! We, the troops stationed in the rear of China, are determined to help our own brother troops do a good job in preparing for the final liberation of Taiwan! Use new victories to match your victories!" This is the unanimous belief of the millions of invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers.

　　给美军一个更狼狈的下场！
    记人民解放军炮兵某部战士们的谈话
    本报记者  穆扬
    朝鲜人民军的胜利进军，已引起了中国人民解放军的无限欢欣和敬意。战士们一致认为兄弟国家的军队的胜利与美帝国主义及李承晚傀儡军的惨败，正是美帝国主义和蒋匪在中国大陆上惨败的再版，也是美帝不久即将在台湾失败的镜子。十九日晚，在我访问人民解放军炮兵某部的战士时，战士们都以亲身的体验说明了这个真理。
    这次我访问的战士，都是在解放战争初期同美国干涉军直接作过战的英雄。在一九四六年的四平战役中，光荣的负过伤并为人民立下特等功的英雄王凤鸣，首先向我叙说了在这个战役中的美国侵略者的丑态：当时在蒋匪军的每个营里都有三个美国军事顾问，另外还有许多美国督战兵。某次战斗中，我军攻入了东大营附近的一个村庄，蒋匪军败下去，美国兵就吓慌了，一个个的都扔下自动步枪撒腿就跑。有几个懂点中国风俗的就跑到女厕所里去，有一个爬进了农民的躺柜，满以为解放军捉不到他们。可是他们并没有跑掉，都被搜出来乖乖地作了俘虏。一个佩着金边肩章的指挥官吓的站不住，紧紧地抱着一棵小树全身打哆嗦。王凤鸣同志的生动表演，经常引起众英雄们的大声哄笑。
    保卫干事胡连生是在四六年参加过冀东安平战斗的。当时有一群蒋匪军想从天津通过解放区去北京，但都怕被歼灭，不敢走。美国兵竟无耻地以为解放军怕他们，就坐着汽车出来替蒋匪开道打头阵。胡连生他们同美国兵遭遇在安平附近，战斗爆发了。胡连生和他的弟兄们冲到了美国兵的面前，美国“少爷”们还没有作好卧倒的准备工作，正在忙着往地下铺毯子。有的吓呆了，我们的战士们从他们脖子上摘下自动步枪来，他们才知道当了俘虏。“美国兵的个子都挺高，一个人一枝自动步枪，进入战斗前咱们有些战士的确有点摸不着他们的底。战斗结束后却都得到了另一个至今没有忘掉的结论：西洋货（美军）比东洋货（日寇）更好打！”
    接着三连连长贾占元和战士王柱林、窦连云、张耀均等也都先后叙说了在冀东遵化、昌黎，东北打虎山和山海关等地，美军向我们进攻的故事。美军的可耻的失败和“丑恶得让人作呕的投降姿态”都曾在这些地方重演过。
    “美帝国主义军队为什么这么松包呢？”这是英雄们的第二个话题。在大家列举了美军的弱点后，特等功臣王凤鸣又叙述了那年打虎山事件中的一个故事。
    打虎山狙击战中，他们俘虏了十几个进犯的美国兵。这些兵虽说还瞧不起解放军，可是当了俘虏总有些怕，一个个哭哭啼啼，给解放军烟抽、写字、敬礼。咱们的一个战士找到一个翻译问他们：“为什么来打中国人民？”他们都说：“不知道，是上级的命令让打的。”最后还一再地说他们都希望活着，希望宽恕他们。让咱们的战士又生气又憎恶。
    “你想想，这样的军队，师出无名，为少数金融寡头，帝国主义分子当侵略工具，怎么能不打败仗呢！”贾占元同志下的结论正是每个英雄都认识到的，也正是美国侵略军在朝鲜的注定命运。因此，英雄们对朝鲜人民军的胜利也是满怀信心的。王柱林说：“我知道中国的内战是怎样打起来的，中国人民是怎样胜利的。我也就明白朝鲜是怎样打起来的和朝鲜人民将怎样取得胜利。”第二次世界大战后，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义在中国、越南、菲律宾、马来亚等地一再重复的历史，使我们的每个战士都懂得了这条真理。胡连生说：“美帝国主义出兵朝鲜的时候，有几个好心肠的同志还说：朝鲜人民军兄弟可别让他们吓住，狠狠地揍他一顿，他才不敢再咬你！现在谁都说：朝鲜人民军真是咱们的好弟兄！”胡连生拍拍胸脯伸出了大拇指。
    朝鲜人民军的胜利还大大地鼓励了英雄们解放台湾的信心。王凤鸣说：“美国的陆军、海军、空军都是一个模子刻出来的：那么大的巡洋舰都让人民军的几只鱼雷艇击沉了，那么多的喷气式、Ｂ２９型飞机都被打落了。不管他什么第七舰队来捣乱，咱们一样解放台湾。问题只在于咱们应该准备的更好，以便把敌人全部消灭在海底！给他们一个更狼狈的下场！”这是英雄们一致的信念。因此，大家谈的不是能否解放台湾的问题，而是怎样解放台湾和怎样支援解放台湾的兄弟部队。
    谈话要结束了，有人交给我好多写给朝鲜人民军的慰问信。这是离我们二十来里地的另一部解放军战士们冒雨送来的。
    “朝鲜人民军兄弟们！我们住在中国后方的部队，坚决帮助我们自己的兄弟部队作好准备工作，最后解放台湾！用新的胜利来配合你们的胜利！”这是天下无敌的数百万中国人民解放军战士们一致的信念。
