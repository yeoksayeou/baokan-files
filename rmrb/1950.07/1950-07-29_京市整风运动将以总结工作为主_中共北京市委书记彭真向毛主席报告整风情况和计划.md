The Beijing Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Peng Zhen, reported to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Chairman Mao on the situation and plan for the Party rectification work in Beijing. There are many experiences worth considering and adopting by Party leading organs in various regions, especially major and medium-sized cities. The report indicates that Beijing has conducted several small-scale rectification movements in the past year. Before and after entering the city, universal education was carried out on the relationship between cadres entering the city and underground work cadres. Last July, in factories and schools, in conjunction with open Party branches, the relationship between Party members and the masses was rectified. Last winter, ideological summaries were universally carried out among机关 cadres. Among public security cadres, two inspections were universally carried out to oppose anarchism and lack of discipline, oppose commandism, and oppose corruption. Since May of this year, four districts have conducted movements to inspect cadre work style and discipline through district people's representative conferences, mainly focusing on commandism and corruption. In another month, district people's representative conferences in the urban areas can be universally held, and the work style and discipline inspection of district-level cadres can come to an end. These small-scale rectification movements have all achieved great results.

In this large-scale national rectification movement, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, after studying the above situation and the instructions of the Central Committee, believes that in Beijing, the focus of rectification should be on summarizing work from top to bottom. According to the spirit of Chairman Mao and other comrades of the Central Committee's reports at the Third Plenary Session, a systematic review of past work should be conducted. This work summary will begin with the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, and then be carried out separately by various departments and district committees and governments, and will lead the cadres and Party members of various departments to rectify their thinking and work style based on the documents and the conclusions of the work summary. This top-down approach is expected to be implemented vigorously.

Regarding the leadership of the rectification, the report proposes that in terms of method, first, read the documents, make a work report on the rectification, then specifically summarize the work, and unfold criticism and self-criticism. In specific leadership, the first is that the top leader should be responsible, personally take action, pay attention to the combination of leading backbone and the masses, and prevent the occurrence of spontaneous tendencies. The second is that the work summaries and ideological work style reviews of each unit are generally carried out through and rely on the leading organs of each organization. Therefore, first of all, attention should be paid to opening up the thinking of the leading cadres of each unit so as to rely on their consciousness to carry out the rectification movement. Higher levels should strengthen leadership, but also prevent taking over and unnecessary transcendence of the organization. The third is to use the form of people's representative conferences to review work and inspect the work style of staff. Every people's representative conference should do this in the future. However, the leadership must pay attention to conducting sufficient ideological preparation among cadres before the meeting; during the meeting, it must pay attention to ensuring that the representatives can speak freely and can guide the firepower of criticism to a direction that is beneficial to improving work, plays a positive role in the work, and does not play a negative role. Fourth, the focus should be on summarizing the work, reviewing the implementation of the Central Committee's policies and guidelines, the experience and lessons learned, and the work style. Problems of violating the discipline of the Party and the People's Government and other organizational problems should be inspected during the rectification, but the specific handling should be handed over to the appropriate organization for resolution.

The report believes that the main unhealthy trends among old cadres now are that some cadres regard themselves as meritorious officials, are arrogant and complacent, pursue enjoyment, and believe that "the revolution has come to an end"; the main unhealthy trends among new Party member cadres are the issue of the relationship between the individual and the Party, and some people work for the Party and serve the people conditionally, with great relativity; the main unhealthy trends among retained personnel are the perfunctory "doing errands" and "getting by" mentality. The prevalent tendencies in higher-level organs and cadres are mainly bureaucracy, and in middle and lower levels, mainly commandism. In cooperation with non-Party members, the main tendencies are closed-doorism and neglect of united front work.

Finally, the report mentioned the issue of rectification in the political power and mass organization systems, pointing out that when summarizing work, all reviews should be based on the Common Program and the policies and decrees of the Central People's Government, and Party and non-Party cadres should be treated equally. However, when reviewing individual ideological work style, Party and non-Party personnel, especially democratic personages, should be differentiated, and non-Party cadres should not be required to meet the standards of Party members. The rectification study of democratic personages should be completely voluntary.

Regarding the time required for Party rectification, the report believes that in addition to reading documents, the entire city will take about two months. For each small unit and individual cadre Party member, one or two weeks is generally appropriate. Because the rectification is carried out in the work, it is not advisable to drag the time too long.

　　京市整风运动将以总结工作为主
    中共北京市委书记彭真向毛主席报告整风情况和计划
    【本报讯】中共北京市委书记彭真向中共中央毛主席报告北京市关于整党工作的情况和计划，其中有许多经验，值得各地，特别是各大城市和中等城市党的领导机关的参考与采用。报告说明北京市在过去一年多，已经进行了多次小规模的整风运动。在入城前后，曾就入城干部和地下工作干部的关系问题，进行过普遍的教育；去年七月，在工厂、学校中，与公开党的支部相结合，曾整顿过党员和群众的关系；去年冬季，在机关干部中，曾普遍进行了思想总结；在公安干部中，曾普遍进行过反对无政府无纪律、反对命令主义和贪污腐化的两次检查；今年五月以来，已有四个区经过区人民代表会议，进行了检查干部作风和检查纪律的运动，主要是检查命令主义和贪污腐化。再有一个月，城区的区人民代表会议可以普遍开一次，区级干部的作风和纪律检查，可告一段落。以上这些小规模的整风运动，都收到了很大效果。
    在此次全国大规模整风运动中，北京市委研究上述情况和中央指示的结果，认为在北京应将整风重点放在自上而下的总结工作方面，根据毛主席和中央其他同志在三中全会报告的精神，系统地检查过去的工作。此项工作总结，首先由市委和市政府开始，然后由各部门和区委、区政府分别进行，并领导各部门的干部、党员根据文件和工作总结的结论，整顿思想和作风。这样自上而下的作法，估计将势如破竹地贯彻下去。
    关于整风的领导，报告中提出在方法上，首先阅读文件，作整风工作报告，然后具体总结工作，展开批评与自我批评。在具体领导上，第一是要首长负责，亲自动手，注意领导骨干与群众相结合，并防止自流倾向发生。第二是各单位工作总结和思想作风检讨，一般地通过与依靠各该组织的领导机关来进行。因此，首先，要注意打通各单位领导干部的思想，以便依靠他们的自觉来进行整风运动。上级要抓紧领导，也要防止包办代替和不必要的超越组织。第三是用人民代表会议的形式来检讨工作，检查工作人员的作风。今后每次人民代表会议都应该这样做。但领导上在会议前必须注意在干部中进行充分的思想准备；在会议中，必须注意既能保证代表们能畅所欲言，又能引导批评的火力指向有益于改进工作的方向，对工作起积极作用，而不起消极作用。第四、重点应是总结工作，检讨对中央方针政策的执行情形和经验教训及工作作风。对于违犯党的和人民政府的纪律的问题及其他组织问题，在整风中自应进行检查，但具体处理，应交由适当的组织去解决。
    报告认为现在在老干部方面的歪风，主要是一部分干部以功臣自居，骄傲自满，追求享受，“革命已经到了头”；在新党员干部方面的歪风，主要是个人与党的关系问题，有些人为党工作为人民服务是有条件的，有很大的相对性；在留用人员方面的歪风，主要是敷衍塞责的“应差”“混饭”主义。在上级机关和干部中普遍存在的倾向主要是官僚主义，中下级主要是命令主义。在与党外人士合作方面，主要是关门主义和忽视统一战线工作的倾向。
    最后报告说到政权和群众组织系统中的整风问题，指出：在总结工作时，应一律根据共同纲领和中央人民政府的政策法令来进行检讨，党与非党干部，应一视同仁。但在检讨个人的思想作风时，党与非党人员，特别是与民主人士，应有所区别，不能以党员的标准，去要求非党干部。民主人士的整风学习，应完全听其自愿。
    关于整党所需的时间，报告认为除阅读文件外，全市约需两个月。从各小单位和干部党员个人来说，一般以一二星期为好。因为是在工作中整风，不宜把时间拉得太长。
