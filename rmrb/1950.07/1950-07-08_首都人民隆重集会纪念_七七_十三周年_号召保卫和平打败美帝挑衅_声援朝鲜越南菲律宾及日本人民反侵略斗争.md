　　Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: More than 5,000 representatives from all sectors of the capital solemnly held the Beijing Municipal Commemoration of the 13th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident today, under the auspices of the China Peace Committee.

　　The conference began with an opening address by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee. (Full text to be published separately)

　　Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. He denounced the US imperialist aggression against the Korean people in violation of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. He said: This shameless atrocity of the US imperialists has been met with blows from the Korean people, and now people of all countries have begun to mobilize to unanimously oppose US imperialism. We, the Chinese people, will actively support the Korean people's struggle for liberation. All of our people are determined to fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the US imperialist aggressors.

　　Bai Yun conveyed the resolution of the International Democratic Women's Federation on the implementation of the Third Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress at the meeting. She said: We Chinese women, together with the people of the whole country, have just turned over from an oppressed position, and in the long suffering of war, we have deeply experienced the preciousness of peace. We cannot lag behind in the work of defending peace, and we must resolutely implement the resolution of the International Democratic Women's Federation. She said: Actively participating in and mobilizing the broad masses of people to sign the peace declaration is the practical action of our implementation of the resolution.

　　Then, Ai Qing reported on the work of the China Peace Propaganda Group in various places. In addition, the following spoke at the meeting: Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Zhang Dazhong, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League; Yang Zaoxin, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Women's Federation; and Zeng Ping, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. They unanimously expressed that the Chinese and Asian people will surely defeat any provocation by imperialism, and called on people from all walks of life to resolutely defend world peace with various practical actions. The conference finally passed a telegram in support of the anti-aggression struggles of the Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The Beijing Municipal Commemoration of the 13th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident passed a telegram in support of the anti-aggression struggles of the Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese people. The full text is as follows:

　　The peace declaration of the Third Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace—the Stockholm Conference—has been warmly supported by peace-loving and democratic people all over the world. Peace signatures have formed an extremely broad mass movement around the world. This magnificent movement has frightened the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism. Therefore, in addition to trembling, the US imperialist war-mongers are directly engaged in aggression, armed intervention in the internal affairs of Korea, stepping up the obstruction of national liberation in Vietnam and the Philippines, and vainly attempting to invade Taiwan of our country. The Chinese people, who have defeated Japanese imperialism and the US imperialist puppet Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, will never be frightened by the outwardly strong but inwardly weak US imperialist aggression. Today, under the leadership of the China Peace Committee, we, the citizens of Beijing, held a meeting to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, and we extend our highest respect to the Korean people who are fighting to the death with the heinous American imperialism to defend their motherland and world peace. We extend our cordial greetings to the patriots who are working hard for national liberation in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. We will also make a contribution to defending world peace and righteous support for the Asian people's liberation movement by completely smashing the interference of the US imperialists and liberating Taiwan. The armed intervention of the US imperialists is digging their own graves, and the final victory belongs to the people who defend peace.

　　首都人民隆重集会纪念“七七”十三周年
    号召保卫和平打败美帝挑衅
    声援朝鲜越南菲律宾及日本人民反侵略斗争
    【本报讯】新华社七日讯：在中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主持下，首都各界代表五千余人今日隆重举行北京市纪念“七七”十三周年大会。
    大会首由中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若致开会词。（全文另发）
    中国和大副主席刘宁一在会上讲话。他痛斥美帝国主义违背雅尔达、波茨坦的协议向朝鲜人民进攻的侵略行为。他说：美帝国主义者的这种无耻暴行已遭到朝鲜人民的打击，现在各国人民已经开始发动起来，一致反对美帝国主义。我们中国人民将积极支援朝鲜人民解放斗争。我们全体人民决心为从美帝国主义侵略者的手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。
    白芸在会上传达了国际民主妇联关于执行世界保卫和平大会第三次常委会的决议。她说：我们中国妇女和全国人民在一起刚刚从被压迫的地位翻了身，在长期的战争痛苦里，深深地体验到和平的宝贵，保卫和平的工作我们也不能落后，我们一定要坚决执行国际妇联的决议。她说：积极参加并发动广大人民在和平宣言上签名，这就是我们执行决议的实际行动。
    接着艾青报告了中国保卫世界和平宣传团在各地的工作情况。此外在会上讲话的有：市总工会副主席萧明、青年团北京市工作委员会副书记张大中、市妇联副主席杨造新、中苏友好协会北京市分会副总干事曾平等。他们一致表示中国和亚洲人民必定能打败帝国主义的任何挑衅，并号召各界人民以各种实际行动坚决保卫世界和平。大会最后通过了声援朝鲜、越南、菲律宾、日本人民反侵略斗争的通电。
    【新华社七日讯】北京市纪念“七七”十三周年大会通过声援朝鲜、越南、菲律宾、日本人民反侵略斗争的通电。全文如下：
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次会议——斯德哥尔摩会议的和平宣言，获得了全世界爱好和平民主的人民热烈拥护。和平签名在全世界形成了极其广泛的群众性运动。这一形势壮阔的运动，已使以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营丧魂夺魄。因此，美帝国主义战争贩子们在战栗发抖之余，便直接从事侵略，武装干涉朝鲜内政，加紧阻挠越南和菲律宾的民族解放，并妄图侵略我国的台湾。曾经战胜了日本帝国主义和美帝傀儡蒋介石反动集团的中国人民，决不会为外强中干的美帝侵略行为所骇倒。今天，我们北京市民在中国保卫世界和平大会委员会的领导下，召开了纪念“七七”抗日战争十三周年的大会，对于正在为保卫祖国保卫世界和平而与穷凶极恶的美国帝国主义作生死肉搏的朝鲜人民，谨致崇高的敬礼。对于在越南、菲律宾、日本为民族解放而艰苦奋斗的志士们，谨致亲切的慰问。我们并将以彻底粉碎美帝国主义者的干涉，解放台湾，作为对保卫世界和平的贡献和对亚洲人民解放运动的正义的声援。美国帝国主义者的武装干涉是自掘坟墓，最后的胜利属于保卫和平的人民。
