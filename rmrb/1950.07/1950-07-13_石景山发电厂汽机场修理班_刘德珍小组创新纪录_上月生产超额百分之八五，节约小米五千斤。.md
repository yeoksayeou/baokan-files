　　Shijingshan Power Plant Steam Turbine Repair Team
    Liu Dezhen Group Sets New Record
    Overfulfilled Production by 85% Last Month, Saving 5,000 Jin of Millet.
    [Our Newspaper] The Liu Dezhen group of the steam turbine repair team at Shijingshan Power Plant completed 100% of its production task in May, and in June completed 185.3% of the collective contract quota, saving 5,000 jin of millet, becoming the most outstanding production team in the plant.
    The Liu Dezhen group consists of four people, including two Party members. Liu Dezhen himself is also the Party branch secretary of the steam turbine workshop. Their experience in overfulfilling production is as follows:
    (1) Emphasize quality inspection. The Liu Dezhen group strives to have the administrative side inspect the quality after each piece of work is completed.
    (2) Use production charts as a tool to supervise production. The production chart is filled out daily, listing the work name, the original scheduled man-hour curve, the daily actual work curve, the percentage completed, as well as material estimation, rework, completion on schedule, over-completion, and explanations. Team members can see the progress of their team's work every day; when there are achievements in the work, it can encourage them, and when the work is not performing well, it can provide a warning and encourage research and improvement. The Liu Dezhen group began implementing the production chart system after the major overhaul of the No. 6 machine last autumn, and has persisted to this day, with continuous improvements in content.
    (3) Prepare in advance and allocate labor in a timely and reasonable manner. Whenever the Liu Dezhen group receives a task, they must first study how it should be done, how many people are needed, who is suitable to do it, what tools are needed, etc., and start working only after preparing everything in advance. This scientific working method makes the progress of the work very fast. During the work process, labor can be allocated in a timely and reasonable manner. For example, when modifying the vaporization water pipe of the No. 3 generator, it required more people at the beginning, so all four worked together; but on the afternoon of the second day, it was found that this work only required two people, so the other two were assigned to other work.
    (4) Hold production meetings to improve working methods and propose rationalization suggestions. The Liu Dezhen group often studies the day's work within ten minutes of the start and end of work, and each person puts forward suggestions for improving the work based on actual experience. For example, when repairing heaters, after the repair and water test, it was found that the pipe was leaking. In the past, white cloth was used to wipe it, which took a day. After research, the group suggested using wind to blow it, which was completed in only fifteen minutes. When repairing the crane's motor, in the past it was taken down for repair. They suggested building two wooden boards on the crane for repair, which resulted in saving half the man-hours. In the first half of June, the Liu Dezhen group researched and proposed more than a dozen ways to improve work methods.
    (5) Carefully check and utilize waste materials. Before the No. 6 generator in the plant was repaired this time, the operating workers kept complaining, "No. 6 machine wastes steam." This time, when finding the center of the steam chamber of No. 6 machine, Liu Dezhen carefully checked and found that the left inlet pipe was broken, and suggested that the administrative side repair it immediately. According to preliminary statistics, when the No. 6 machine leaked steam, it produced 1,000 kilowatts less electricity per hour, which amounted to 24 tons more coal per day. There was a drilling machine in the maintenance section, which was originally driven by a seven-horsepower electric roller. After Li Wentong in the group researched, he suggested changing to a two-horsepower electric roller, which was sufficient. For example, for the vacuum leather pump of the No. 6 machine circulating pump, the administrative side originally planned to use new steel pipes to install the pipes leading to the outdoor cold trench. After research by Liu Dezhen and his teammate Li Wen, they used waste pipes from the boiler, saving two steel pipes that were two and a half inches thick, equivalent to more than 600 jin of millet.
    What should be particularly emphasized is the leadership method of the group leader. Liu Dezhen is willing to work hard and actively unite the masses. He often humbly said to his teammates: "Work can only be done well if everyone studies it." "The glory belongs to everyone, not to me." Everyone discusses the work together, and he takes the initiative to review himself when there are shortcomings. He is willing to accept other people's opinions and actively helps and takes care of his teammates, so the team is very united and the work is easy to do well.

　　石景山发电厂汽机场修理班
    刘德珍小组创新纪录
    上月生产超额百分之八五，节约小米五千斤。
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂汽机场修理班刘德珍小组，五月份完成生产任务百分之百，六月份完成集体合同定额百分之一百八十五点三，节省小米达五千斤，成为该厂生产成绩最出色的小组。
    刘德珍小组共有四人，内党员二人，刘德珍本人又是汽机场的党分支书记。他们超额完成生产的经验是这样的：
    （一）重视质量检查。刘德珍小组每做完一件工作，都争取行政方面检查质量。
    （二）以生产图表作为监督生产的工具。每日填写生产图表，图表中列着工作名称、原定工数曲线、每日实际工作曲线及完成的百分数，还有估料、反工、按期完成、超额完成及说明等。组员每天都能见到自己小组的工作进度；工作有成绩时，可以起鼓励作用，工作成绩不好时，能得到警惕和研究改进。刘德珍小组自去秋六号机大修后，就开始实施了生产图片制，一直坚持到今天，而且内容日有改进。
    （三）事先准备，及时合理调配劳动力。刘德珍小组每接到一件工作，必先研究应该如何作，需要多少人，谁干适宜，要用那些工具等，事先准备就绪，才开始干。这种科学的工作方法，做起活来进度很快。在工作进行中，又能及时合理调配劳力。如改修三号发电机汽化水管时，开始时需要人多，就四人一起干；但第二天下午，发现这件工作只需两人就成，其他二人就改作其他工作了。
    （四）召开生产会议，改进工作方法，提出合理化建议。刘德珍小组经常在上、下班的十分钟内，研究当天的工作，每人根据实际体验，提出改进工作的意见。如修加热器，修好后上水试验，发现管子漏，过去用白布擦，需用一天时间。该组研究后，建议改用风吹，只用十五分钟就完成了。修起重机的马达，过去是落下来修，他们建议在起重机上搭上两块木板修，结果省工时一半。在六月份上半月，刘德珍小组共研究提出十几条改进工作的方法。
    （五）细心检查，利用废料。该厂六号发电机这次修理之前，运行工友老喊：“六号机费汽。”这次找六号机蒸汽室中心时，刘德珍仔细检查出左侧导入管折断了，并建议行政方面立即修好。据初步统计，六号机漏汽时，每小时少带一千千瓦电，合成煤，一天多费二十四吨。维护股有一盘钻眼床子，本是用七匹马力电滚带着，该组李文通研究后，建议改用两匹马力电滚带着，就已足够用了。又如六号机循环泵真空皮泵，按装通至室外冷沟的管子，行政方面原计划是用新钢管，经刘德珍及同组的李文研究，利用锅炉的废管，省下了两根二英寸半粗的钢管子，合小米六百多斤。
    特别应当提出的是小组长的领导方法，刘德珍肯埋头苦干，并主动地团结群众。他时常虚心地对同组的工友说：“工作要大伙研究才能做得好。”“光荣不是我的是大家的。”工作来了大家商量着做，有了缺点他自己先做检讨。肯于接受别人的意见，又主动的帮助和照顾同组工友，所以同组间团结得很密切，工作容易做好。
