Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd—Tianjin's primary school education has seen significant improvements in the past six months. Currently, there are 408 public and private primary schools in the city, an increase of 27 compared to last year. The number of students has reached over 159,800, exceeding more than half of the total number of school-age children in the city. This spring, 28,928 out-of-school children enrolled, with children of workers, peasants, and poor urban residents accounting for 79 percent. To address the tuition fee issue for poor children, schools have provided appropriate assistance to students unable to pay. The Municipal Bureau of Education allocated over 26,000 jin of millet to subsidize learning materials for the children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and poor students.

In the past six months, many schools have initially managed to grasp teachers' learning and work in terms of administrative leadership, and have organized teachers to research and improve their professional skills. Each district has universally organized "demonstration teaching" to exchange experiences. The majority of teachers, after a year and a half of study, have established the view of serving the people. In terms of teaching methods, some have studied the use of object teaching and appropriately organized students to participate in various extracurricular activities, which has played a certain role in improving teaching effectiveness.

The Municipal Bureau of Education has also started to rectify private primary schools. The rectification steps focus on strengthening the administrative leadership of each school, improving teaching skills, and urging the board of directors to be responsible for the school. The Municipal Bureau of Education also provides appropriate subsidies to private primary schools that can implement the New Democratic education policy, have achieved good results in administrative leadership and teaching, and have increased the enrollment of children of workers and peasants but are indeed facing financial difficulties. In the past six months, the Municipal Bureau of Education has allocated over 53,000 jin of millet for personnel and book subsidies to private primary schools.

　　天津小学较去年增二十七所
    今春二万八千失学儿童入学
    各校行政领导及教学方法日有改进
    【新华社天津三日电】天津市的小学教育，半年来已有显著改进。目前全市公私立小学共四百零八所，较去年增加了二十七所；学生人数已达十五万九千八百余人，超过全市学龄儿童总数的一半以上。今春入学的失学儿童有二万八千九百二十八名，内工农及贫苦市民子弟占百分之七十九，各校为解决贫苦儿童的学费问题，对无力缴纳学费的学生都酌情予以照顾。市教育局曾拨出小米二万六千余斤，补助烈军干属和贫苦学生学习用品。
    半年来不少学校在行政领导上，已初步做到掌握教师的学习和工作，组织教员研究与改进业务。各区普遍组织了“观摩教学”，互相交流经验。多数教员经过一年半来的学习，已树立了为人民服务的观点。在教学方法上，有的研究运用实物教学，适当组织学生进行各种课外活动等，在教学效果上起了一定的作用。
    市教育局对于私立小学亦着手整顿。整顿的步骤着重加强各校的行政领导，提高教学业务，促使董事会对学校负责。对能执行新民主主义教育方针、行政领导与教学有成绩并增加招收工农子弟入学而经费确有困难的私立小学，市教育局亦给予适当补助。半年来市教育局共拨给私立小学人事、图书补助费小米五万三千余斤。
