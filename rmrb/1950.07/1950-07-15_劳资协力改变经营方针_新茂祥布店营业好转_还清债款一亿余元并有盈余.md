　　Labor-Management Cooperation Changes Business Strategy
　　Xin Mao Xiang Cloth Shop Improves Business
　　Repays Debts of Over 100 Million Yuan and Achieves Surplus

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the labor-management consultation committee, the Xin Mao Xiang Cloth Shop in Beijing has, with the help of the labor side, changed its business strategy to focus on the worker and peasant masses, adopting a policy of small profits and quick turnover. This has reversed the serious deficit situation. In the past three months, the daily turnover has increased from 900,000 yuan to 6 million yuan, repaying external debts of 120 million yuan and achieving a surplus.

　　This shop opened in 1939 with a capital equivalent to about 1,000 bolts of cloth. In the past, its business strategy consistently involved borrowing from banks and taking advantage of soaring prices to speculate for exorbitant profits. The goods prepared were also aimed at upper-class consumers such as bureaucratic capitalists. After the liberation of Beijing, prices gradually stabilized, and the shop's business declined. In January of this year, the shop's inventory was equivalent to 700 bolts of cloth, while external debts and interest had reached 400 to 500 bolts. However, the capital side still fantasized that as long as prices fluctuated a few more times, they could use the old tricks a few more times to pay off the external debts. After March, prices stabilized, and the situation of speculating for exorbitant profits was gone forever. In early April, the shop actually owed 120 million yuan in external debts, equivalent to about 500 bolts of cloth. At that time, the highest interest rate was 70%, and the monthly interest payment required funds equivalent to 60 bolts of cloth. Moreover, the retail business targeting high-end consumers was extremely sluggish, coupled with huge expenses, which brought the shop almost to the brink of closure.

　　After liberation, most of the shop's employees participated in and persisted in learning, and their political awareness was unprecedentedly enhanced. Seeing the shop's perilous situation, they first studied how to overcome the difficulties and actively suggested that the capital side change its business strategy. After both sides deliberated, the shop convened its first labor-management consultation meeting in early April. At the meeting, the employees put forward specific methods to change the business strategy, save money to repay debts, overcome difficulties, and strive for improved business. These methods included: (1) Changing the target of business to the worker and peasant masses, and focusing on coarse cloth and blue cloth in the future; selling the previously stored silk and satin at the purchase price to increase capital turnover. (2) Using half of the daily sales revenue to purchase goods and half to repay debts to reduce the interest burden; employees stopped receiving salaries for one month, and all two meals were changed to coarse grains. The shop's manager, who was a member of the preparatory committee of the trade association, also had a further understanding of the policy of benefiting both labor and capital at that time. He agreed with the labor side's suggestion to change the business strategy and expressed that he did not want the labor side to live too hard. After discussion, it was decided that the labor's wages would not be stopped, but temporarily deferred without special uses, and kept in the shop to enrich capital turnover; meals were changed to one coarse grain and one fine grain meal per day. The shop also accepted the suggestion of veteran employee Qiu Bo-wu to strengthen publicity, using a large piece of cloth with samples of all the shop's goods pasted on it, and marking the prices, hanging it at the door. This attracted more customers than the previous method of simply writing the names of the goods. It also made two radio broadcasts for publicity.

　　After the first labor-management consultation meeting, the labor and capital sides actively managed the business. The employees held a review meeting once a week, mutually reviewing labor discipline and their attitude towards customers. The manager also often went to the counter to socialize with customers. The business situation improved day by day, and the turnover increased sharply, from 900,000 yuan per day to 4 million to 6 million yuan per day. By early May, in just one month, half of the external debt - 60 million yuan - had been repaid. At this time, the shop convened its second labor-management consultation meeting to review the business in the past month, and found that there were still shortcomings in selling off inventory. Most of the inventory sold were common goods (cloth), and the really difficult-to-sell silk and satin had not yet been sold. At the meeting, the capital side accepted the labor side's suggestion: to sell the easy-to-sell cotton cloth inventory at a profit of 1% (the past month was sold at the purchase price), and to further reduce the prices of the difficult-to-sell silk, satin, and linen goods, and advocated selling the silk remnants as finished materials, and the previously stored silk, linen, and cloth scraps were also sold cheaply. At the same time, in order to reward everyone for quickly selling these goods, it was stipulated that whoever sold a piece of material would be awarded a "commission" of 500 yuan. Since the implementation of this method, all the stored silk, satin, and linen goods were sold out in more than twenty days. This played a great role in the shop's capital turnover.

　　At the end of May, the labor and capital sides held a third consultation meeting and decided that the profit margin would not exceed 2% in the future, adhering to the principle of small profits and quick turnover. In order to take care of customers, the working hours were extended to 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM every day.

　　In June, only 30 million yuan of external debt remained. It would have been repaid with five or six days of business income, but in order to maintain relations with the bank and because the interest rate had been reduced to 5%, the account was not cleared at that time, but borrowed as working capital. By the end of June, there was no external debt at all, and there was a surplus. The business situation has fundamentally improved.

　　Currently, the shop can earn at least 500,000 yuan in gross profit every day, netting more than one bolt of cloth after deducting expenses. Currently, it is a slow month for selling cloth. If the peak season for selling cloth arrives after August, the shop's business will definitely become more prosperous. (Wang Zhenmin)

　　劳资协力改变经营方针
    新茂祥布店营业好转
    还清债款一亿余元并有盈余
    【本报讯】京市新茂祥布店，自成立劳资协商会议后，劳方帮助资方改变经营方针，面向工农大众，薄利多销，扭转了严重的亏累局面，三个月以来，流水收入由每日九十万元增至六百万元，还清外债一亿二千万元并有了盈余。
    该号一九三九年开业时，资本约折合一千匹布。过去营业方针一贯以挪借银行款项，利用物价暴涨，投机谋取暴利；所备货品亦系以官僚资本家等上层消费者为对象。京市解放后，物价日趋平稳，该号营业不振。今年一月柜上存货折合布七百匹，而外债及利息已达四、五百匹。但当时资方仍幻想着只要物价再波动几次，施用几次故技，即可将外债还清。三月以后，物价稳定，投机牟取暴利的情况已一去不返。四月初时，该号实欠外债一亿二千万元，约合五百匹布，当时最高利息达七十分，每月付息即需款合六十匹布。而以高等消费者为对象的门市营业极为萧条，加以开支浩大，致使该号几乎陷于关门绝境。
    该号店员在解放后，大部分参加并坚持了学习，政治觉悟空前提高；及见该店如此危局，乃首先研究了如何度过困难的办法，并积极建议资方改变经营方针。经双方酝酿后，四月初该号召开了第一次劳资协商会议。会上，店员提出了改变营业方针、节约还债，以克服困难争取营业好转的具体办法。这些办法包括：（一）改以工农大众为营业对象，今后以粗布、蓝布为主要货品；将过去所存绸缎麻缎等按来价脱售，增加资金流转。（二）每天所售货款以半数进货，半数还债，减轻利息负担；职工停薪一月，伙食两顿全改为粗粮。该号经理，为同业公会筹备委员，当时对劳资两利政策亦有了进一步的认识，他同意劳方所提出的改变营业方针的建议，并表示不愿劳方生活过苦。经商讨结果，决定劳方薪资不停，但无特殊用途可暂行缓支，留存柜上以裕资金流转；伙食改为每天粗、细粮各一顿。该号并接受了老职工邱泊鋙加强宣传的建议，用一大幅布，上面粘上该店所有货品的样本，并标明价格，挂在门口，这样比过去只简单写出货名的办法，吸引了更多的顾客。且在电台作了两次广播宣传。
    第一次劳资协商会后，劳资双方积极经营。店员每周开检讨会一次，互相检讨劳动纪律，及对待顾客的态度。经理也常到柜上应酬顾客。营业情形一天天好转起来，流水收入急遽增加，由过去每日九十万元增为每日四百万元至六百万元。至五月初，仅一个月间，已还清外债的一半——六千万元。是时该号又召开了第二次劳资协商会议，检查过去一个月来的营业，发现脱售存货仍有缺点，所售出的存货多系大路货（布类），真正不好卖的绸缎麻缎等仍未售出。会上，资方接受了劳方的建议：把好卖的棉布类存货，按一分利（过去一个月是按来价卖出）脱售，把难卖的绸、缎、麻货再降低价格，并主张把丝绸残货，裁为成料销售，以前所存的绸、麻、布头也都一齐廉价出售。同时为奖励大家快销此类货品，规定谁经手售出一块料子，奖给五百元的“佣金”。自实行此法后，二十余天就将所存的绸、缎、麻货全部销光。对该店的资金流转，起了很大作用。
    五月底，劳资双方又开了第三次协商会议，决定今后利润不超过二分利，坚持薄利多销，并为照顾顾客，延长工作时间为每日晨六时至晚十时。
    六月间，外债仅剩了三千万元，本来以五、六天的营业收入就可还清，但为与银行维持往来，且利率已降为五分，故当时暂未清账，借充流动金。至六月底，已全无外债，且有了盈余。营业情况已经根本好转。
    目前，该号每天至少可赚五十万元毛利，除去开支净赚一匹布以上。目前是销布淡月，如至八月以后，销布旺季到来，该号营业定将更趋发达。（王振民）
