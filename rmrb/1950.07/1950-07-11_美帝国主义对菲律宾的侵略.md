U.S. President Truman, in his statement on June 27, announced that the United States would strengthen its intervention in the Philippine people's liberation struggle. Truman declared: "I have instructed to strengthen U.S. forces in the Philippines and to increase military assistance to the Philippine government." Truman's statement to further aggression against the Philippines is merely the logical result of the U.S. imperialist policy of enslaving the Philippine people and turning the Philippines into a U.S. base of aggression in the Far East. As early as shortly after the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism, in view of the Philippine people's awakening and their commencement of resistance, and that the old colonial rule could no longer protect the special privileges of monopoly capital in the Philippines, accelerated the support of the traitorous Philippine bandits Roxas and Quirino. In April 1946, U.S. imperialism used violence and trickery to have Roxas elected as president and Quirino as vice president, establishing a new puppet regime, and on July 4 of the same year announced the so-called "independent" Republic of the Philippines. Its purpose was to attempt, through the Roxas and Quirino clique, the U.S.'s watchdog for its interests in the Philippines, to continue to maintain its colonial rule over the Philippines under the guise of so-called "independence," and to use the Philippines as a stepping stone to expand its aggression against various Asian countries.

What has been the situation in the Philippines since its "independence" four years ago? The situation is: (1) According to the U.S.-Philippine "Military Agreement" of March 1947, the Roxas and Quirino clique presented twenty-three military bases to U.S. imperialism. On June 15 of this year, the U.S. and the Philippines signed a new base agreement, granting the United States the right to expand its bases. Today, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Cowen and the head of the military mission are still the supreme rulers of the Philippines; (2) With the announcement of "independence," U.S. imperialism, through the Quirino clique, launched a war against the Philippine People's Liberation Army (formerly known as the People's Anti-Japanese Army), plunging the broad masses of the Philippine people into dire straits; (3) The United States, through the hands of the Quirino clique, banned the activities of all progressive organizations in the Philippines, as well as freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association; (4) The United States and the Roxas and Quirino clique have concluded two bills that enslave the Philippines: the "Bell Trade Act" and the "Parity Rights Amendment."

The so-called Bell Trade Act stipulates that for the first eight years, the pre-war U.S.-Philippine "free trade" system will be restored. In the subsequent twenty years, the quota of Philippine products imported into the United States will increase by five percent each year until 1974, when normal tax rates will be levied. At the same time, for the first eight years, U.S. goods imported into the Philippines will continue to be tax-free and unlimited. During the subsequent twenty years, a tax of five percent will also be levied each year. This Bell Act has completely suppressed the Philippines to the status of a U.S. colony, continuing to be a source of raw materials and a market for U.S. imperialism. All production in the Philippines is entirely configured for export trade. Although the Philippines' rice production is not sufficient for its own needs, it still has to grow other products needed by the United States. The result of the dumping of U.S. goods (90 percent of which are consumer goods) into the Philippines has created a huge trade deficit between the U.S. and the Philippines. According to statistics from 1948 and 1949, this deficit is over 225 million U.S. dollars per year.

As for the so-called Parity Rights Amendment, it stipulates that U.S. citizens and companies are allowed to enjoy the same rights as Philippine companies in the Philippines, that is, they continue to maintain the privilege of developing natural resources. Under the guarantee of the "Parity Rights Amendment," U.S. capital completely monopolized the post-war economic life of the Philippines. According to statistics announced on December 31, 1948, the total population of the Philippines was 19.2 million, and the number of Americans was less than 10,000, of which more than 1,000 were enterprise owners and their employees affiliated with U.S. monopoly capitalists (in addition, there were soldiers, priests, teachers, various advisors to the Philippine government, lawyers, etc.). In fact, hundreds of American business owners controlled the Philippines' national banks, industries, foreign trade, mining production, maritime fisheries, and transportation.

The result of the United States' intensified aggression against the Philippines has strangled the Philippines' national industry and commerce and caused severe impoverishment of the Philippine people. According to statistics in March of this year, the unemployed population in the Philippines (including agricultural workers) reached 3 million, that is, an average of one out of about six people is unemployed, or one out of two households is unemployed. Even workers who are employed are living in extreme hardship. After the war, the Philippine government stipulated that the daily wage of workers was 1.25 pesos, but the minimum living cost for a family of three was 7 pesos per day. Under the strong opposition of organized workers, the reactionary government was forced to raise the base wage to 4 pesos, but the workers were still in a state of semi-starvation. Those millions of workers who have not yet been organized and the vast agricultural workers are still receiving meager wages of one to two pesos per day. Hernandez, chairman of the Philippine Congress of Industrial Organizations, said: "The poverty of the Philippines is a by-product of U.S. economic policy. The Philippines needs machines, tractors, and industrial equipment, but Washington is talking about transporting arms and ammunition to slaughter farmers. Consumer goods are dumped in large quantities, strangling the domestic industry. We sell raw materials at prices set by the United States, and then buy back manufactured goods at U.S. prices!"

The facts of the past four years have educated the Philippine people, making them more aware of the true faces of U.S. imperialism and the Quirino clique. The Philippine People's Liberation Army, after four years of hard fighting, has become increasingly stronger and has gained the support of a broader range of the Philippine people. Truman's announcement to step up arms aid to the Philippines precisely demonstrates the bankruptcy of U.S. imperialism's "independence" deception.

　　美帝国主义对菲律宾的侵略
    王唯真
    美总统杜鲁门在六月二十七日发表的声明中，宣布美国要加强对菲律宾人民解放斗争的干涉。杜鲁门宣称：“我已指示加强美国在菲部队，加强对菲政府的军事援助”。杜鲁门这个进一步侵略菲律宾的声明，只是美国奴役菲律宾人民和变菲律宾为美国远东侵略基地的帝国主义政策逻辑的结果。早在第二次世界大战结束之后不久，美帝国主义鉴于菲律宾人民已经觉悟和开始进行反抗，旧的殖民地统治方式已保不了垄断资本在菲的特权，于是加紧扶植卖国菲奸罗哈斯、季里诺等。一九四六年四月，美帝国主义用暴力和诈术使罗哈斯当选为总统、季里诺为副总统，建立了新的傀儡政权，并于同年七月四日宣布所谓菲律宾“独立”共和国的成立。其目的是企图通过美国在菲律宾利益的看门狗罗哈斯、季里诺集团，以所谓“独立”为幌子，来继续维持其对菲律宾的殖民地统治；并以菲律宾为踏脚石，来扩大对亚洲各国的侵略。
    菲律宾“独立”迄今已四年了，情况究竟怎样？情况是：（一）根据一九四七年三月的美菲“军事协定”，罗哈斯、季里诺集团奉送了二十三个军事基地给美帝国主义。今年六月十五日，美菲又签订了新的基地协定，予美国以扩大基地的权利。今天，美国驻菲大使柯温和军事使团的负责人，仍然是菲律宾的最高统治者；（二）随着“独立”的宣布，美帝国主义通过季里诺集团，对菲律宾人民解放军（原称人民抗日军）发动了战争，陷菲律宾广大人民于水深火热之境；（三）美国假季里诺集团之手，取缔了菲律宾一切进步团体的活动，和言论、出版、集会结社的自由；（四）美国和罗哈斯、季里诺集团，订立了奴役菲律宾的两个法案：“贝尔贸易法案”和“平等权利法案”。
    所谓贝尔贸易法规定最初八年恢复战前的美菲“自由贸易”制度，其后二十年间，菲岛每年输入美国的限额产品按年增加百分之五的关税，直至一九七四年，才照平常税率征收。同时，在最初八年，美国货物输入菲岛继续免税，而且货物无限额，其后二十年间也是每年征税百分之五。这一贝尔法案，已把菲律宾完全压制在美国的殖民地的地位，继续成为美帝国主义的原料出产地和商品的销售市场。菲律宾的一切生产，完全为了输出贸易而配置。虽然菲律宾的米产尚不敷本国之需，仍不得不种植美国所需要的其他产品。而美货（百分之九十是消费品）对菲倾销的结果，造成美菲贸易的巨大差额，根据一九四八年与一九四九年的统计，这种差额每年在二亿二千五百万美元以上。
    至于所谓平等权利法，则规定容许美国的公民和公司，在菲岛与菲律宾公司享受同等权利，即是他们继续保持开发自然资源的特权。在“平等权利法”保证之下，美国资本完全垄断了菲律宾战后的经济生活。根据一九四八年十二月三十一日宣布的统计，全菲人口一千九百二十万人，美国人不到一万人，其中一千余人是美国垄断资本家系属的企业主及其雇佣人（此外是兵士、教士、教师、菲政府的各种顾问、律师等等）。实际上几百个美国企业主，却控制了菲律宾全国的银行、工业、对外贸易、矿场生产、海上渔业和交通运输。
    美国加紧侵略菲律宾的结果，扼杀了菲律宾的民族工商业，并造成了菲律宾人民的严重贫困化。根据今年三月份的统计，菲律宾的失业人口（包括农业工人）达三百万人，即平均约六人中有一人失业，或两户中有一人失业。即使在业工人，其生活也极为困苦。战后菲政府规定工人每日工资为一·二五比索，但三口之家的最低生活费每日需七比索。在有组织的工人的强烈反对下，反动政府虽然被迫把工资基数提高到四比索，但工人还是处于半饥饿状态。而那些数以百万计的尚未组织起来的工人和广大的农业工人，仍旧每天拿着一比索到二比索的低微工资。菲律宾产业职工大会主席赫南特兹说：“菲律宾的贫困，是美国经济政策的副产品。菲律宾需要机器、拖拉机、及工业设备，但华盛顿则在谈论着运送武器弹药来屠杀农民。消费品又大量倾销，绞杀了本国的工业。我们按照美国规定的价格出售原料，而又按照美国的价格购回制成品！”
    四年来的事实，教育了菲律宾的人民，使他们更加认清了美帝国主义和季里诺集团的真面目。菲律宾人民解放军，经过四年奋战以后，已经日益强大，日益得到更广大的菲律宾人民的拥护。杜鲁门宣布加紧以武器援助菲律宾，恰恰表现了美帝国主义的“独立”欺骗的破产。
