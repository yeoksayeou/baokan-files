Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: TASS, Moscow, 30th – On June 27th, US Ambassador Kirk delivered a memorandum containing a statement from the US government to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko. The content is as follows: I am instructed by my government to bring to your attention the fact that North Korean forces have crossed the 38th parallel in several places and have launched a large-scale invasion of the territory of the Republic of Korea. The Soviet representative's refusal to attend the Security Council meeting in New York on June 25th, disregarding the clear threat to peace and the obligations of Security Council members under the United Nations Charter, necessitates that the US government bring this matter directly to the attention of the Soviet government. Given the well-known close relationship between the Soviet Union and the North Korean regime, the US government therefore requests assurance that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics disclaims responsibility for this unwarranted act of aggression and will use its influence with the North Korean authorities to ensure the immediate withdrawal of their invading forces.

On June 29th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, made the following statement to Mr. Kirk:

“On behalf of the Soviet government, I am instructed to make the following statement in response to the statement of the government of the United States of America presented by you on June 27th:

One, according to reliable information from the Soviet government, the events currently taking place in Korea were provoked by an attack by South Korean authorities' forces on the border areas of North Korea. Therefore, the South Korean authorities and their manipulators behind the scenes should be held responsible for these events.

Two, as is well known, the Soviet government withdrew its troops from Korea before the US government, thereby demonstrating its consistent principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The Soviet government continues to adhere to the principle of not allowing foreign interference in Korean internal affairs.

Three, it is untrue to say that the Soviet government refused to participate in the Security Council meetings. Despite the Soviet government's great goodwill, it was impossible to participate in the Security Council meetings because the Security Council's permanent member – China – has not been admitted to the Security Council due to the US government's position, which makes it impossible for the Security Council to pass legally binding decisions.”

　　葛罗米柯驳复美照会
    朝鲜事件为李承晚及其操纵者挑起，中苏未出席，安理会决定自然无效。
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：六月二十七日，美国大使寇克先生向苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯递交包括美国政府声明的备忘录一件，内容如下：兹奉本国政府之命提请阁下注意一项事实：北朝鲜部队已在数处越过北纬三十八度，并大举侵犯大韩民国的领土。苏联代表六月二十五日不顾和平所受的明白的威胁，不顾安理会理事国依照联合国宪章应负的义务，拒绝参加联合国安理会纽约会议，这就要求美国政府将此事直接提请苏联政府注意。有鉴于苏联与北朝鲜政权有紧密的关系这一众所周知的事实，美国政府因而要求保证：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟否认对此无理寻衅的进攻负有责任，并将利用其对北朝鲜当局的影响，使北朝鲜当局立即撤退其进犯部队。
    六月二十九日，苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯奉苏联政府之命向寇克先生声明如下：
    “兹奉苏联政府之命，就阁下六月二十七日所提出的美利坚合众国政府的声明作如下声明：
    一、根据苏联政府的可靠材料，朝鲜所正发生的事件乃由南朝鲜当局的部队对北朝鲜边境地区的进攻所挑起。因此，这些事件应由南朝鲜当局及其幕后操纵者负责。
    二、如所周知，苏联政府已先于美国政府从朝鲜撤兵，从而证明了它一向不干涉他国内政的原则。苏联政府继续坚守不容许外国干涉朝鲜内政的原则。
    三、说苏联政府拒绝参加安理会会议是不确实的。尽管苏联政府怀着极大善意，然而却不可能参加安理会会议，因为安理会常任理事国——中国由于美国政府的立场而未被安理会接纳，这使得安理会不可能通过具有法律效力的决定。”
