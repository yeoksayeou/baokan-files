　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th, TASS dispatch from Pyongyang on the 15th: People from all walks of life in the newly liberated areas of southern Korea warmly support the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　The newspapers in Seoul publish many talks every day by workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, capitalists, and merchants. They express their gratitude to the People's Army who liberated them. They also express great happiness because, from now on, they can live according to the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. A worker at the Seoul Power Plant wrote: The Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea guarantees progressive labor laws and social insurance laws, and also guarantees in legislation the continuous rise of the material and cultural living standards of the working people. He also wrote: Today we have obtained the rights to work, rest, and education. I am very grateful to Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, and to the heroic People's Army who liberated us, enabling us to live as happily as the people in the northern part of the Republic. An assistant at Seoul University wrote: The so-called "constitution" of South Korea is an anti-national, disastrous constitution that protects the interests of the ruling, exploiting minority, which is why educators must resolutely fight against the Syngman Rhee clique.

　　南朝鲜新解放区人民热烈拥护共和国宪法
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社平壤十五日讯：朝鲜南部新解放区各阶层人民热烈拥护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法。
    汉城各报每天都发表工人、农民、学生、知识分子、资本家和商人的许多谈话。他们向解放他们的人民军表示感激。他们并表示很大的高兴，因为从此以后，他们可以根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法而生活下去。汉城电力厂一个工人写道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法保证有进步的劳工法和社会保险法，在立法上也保证劳动人民物质生活和文化水准的不断高涨。他并写道：我们今天已获得了工作、休息和教育的权利。我非常感激朝鲜人民的领袖金日成及解放我们的英勇的人民军，他们使我们有机会像共和国北部人民一样幸福地生活下去。汉城大学一助教写道：南朝鲜的所谓“宪法”，是一部反民族的、灾难的宪法，它保护了统治者、剥削者少数人的利益，这就是为什么教育工作者们必须坚决与李承晚集团进行斗争的原因。
