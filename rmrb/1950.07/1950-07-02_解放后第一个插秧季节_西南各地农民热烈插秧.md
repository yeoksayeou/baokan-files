Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 25th: The rice transplanting work in rural areas of the Southwest region has largely concluded, with the minority areas on the Yunnan Plateau, where the transplanting season is later, also nearing completion. The newly transplanted rice seedlings are all very strong.

This is the first rice transplanting season after the liberation of Southwest China, and the farmers have displayed great enthusiasm for production. Before transplanting, farmers in various regions actively expanded cultivated land area and converted dry land into paddy fields. For example, farmers in Pixian County, Western Sichuan, planted crops on the edges of roads, field ridges, corners of land, and between graves, thereby increasing cultivated land by more than 10,000 mu. The area of seedling fields in the suburbs of Zigong City, Southern Sichuan, also increased by a quarter compared to previous years. Farmers in many areas of Northern Sichuan took advantage of the abundant rainfall this year to convert dry land that had not been used for rice cultivation for more than a decade into paddy fields. Among them, the paddy field area in Xichong County this year increased by two times compared to last year. At the same time, farmers in various regions also devoted themselves to intensive cultivation. For example, farmers in Changshou and other counties in Eastern Sichuan generally plowed and harrowed three times, while farmers in Linshui County even plowed and harrowed four times.

In order to solve the production difficulties of the farmers, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government and the Western Sichuan and Southern Sichuan Administrative Offices issued agricultural loans of approximately 45 million jin of rice before transplanting.

　　解放后第一个插秧季节
    西南各地农民热烈插秧
    【新华社重庆二十五日电】西南区农村插秧工作已大体结束，插秧节令较晚的云南高原少数地区也即将完成。各地新插秧苗均极健壮。
    这是西南解放后的第一个插秧季节，农民生产热情很好。各地农民在插秧前纷纷进行扩大耕地面积和把旱地变成水田的工作。如川西郫县农民利用大路边田坎、地角和坟隙种植农作物，从而增加了一万多亩耕地；川南自贡市市郊的秧田也较往年增加了四分之一；川北许多地区的农民利用今年雨水充沛的有利条件，把十余年来未曾种稻的旱田都改成了水田，其中西充县今年的水田面积即较去年增加了两倍。与此同时，各地农民还特别致力于精耕细作，如川东长寿等县农民普遍地做到三犁三耙，邻水县农民更作到四犁四耙。
    为了解决农民群众生产上的困难，贵州省人民政府和川西、川南两行署曾在插秧前发放了约四千五百万斤大米的农业贷款。
