    Respects to the Heroic Korean People, Join Hands to Oppose American Aggression
    [This newspaper] On the evening of July 26th, at the conference for signing the three-shift competition contract and the five-site joint contract, all the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant passed a telegram to the Korean people. The telegram stated: Heroic Korean people:
    In order to oppose the crazy aggression of American imperialism and its running dog, the Li Seung-man gang, and to strive for the independence and unification of the motherland, you have carried out a heroic people's liberation war. Your invincible People's Army has beaten American imperialism and its running dog, the Li Seung-man bandit army, to a pulp; a large number of American soldiers have been captured, and many large cities in South Korea have been liberated. You are also tenaciously carrying out the work of restoring the wounds under the bestial bombing of the enemy. We, the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant, warmly celebrate your victory and pay our highest respects to you. We, the workers of the power plant, are determined to support you with all kinds of efforts.
    Heroic Korean people, let us join hands closely to fight for the complete crushing of the aggression of the imperialist warmongers!
