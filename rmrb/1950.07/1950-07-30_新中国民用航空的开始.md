　　The Beginning of New China's Civil Aviation
　　The naming ceremony of the "Beijing" giant aircraft was held in Beijing yesterday. From August 1st, the domestic civil aviation of New China will officially begin partial operation. This is an important beginning for the construction of New China's civil aviation. In the past, the Chinese people did not have civil aviation. Because the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, defeated American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Chinese people were able to initially establish civil aviation in a short period of time and begin operations. The uprising of the China and Central Aviation Corporations on November 9th last year created important conditions for the Chinese people to build a new civil aviation industry. However, due to the various obstructions of British and American imperialism, most of the aircraft and main assets of the two aviation companies remaining in Hong Kong could not be moved back. Over the past eight months, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, all civil aviation employees have united and overcome various difficulties to carry out tasks such as demobilization, internal relocation, and inventory of equipment, laying a preliminary foundation for the opening of civil aviation and future construction work.

　　During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China's civil aviation industry was under the control of American and German imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, serving imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Especially in the last ten years, the Kuomintang reactionaries used it to carry out many anti-people activities. This situation has fundamentally changed today. New China's civil aviation must serve the people, that is, it must serve the economic, political, and cultural construction of the Chinese people. This is a glorious task. However, to be able to accomplish this task, all civil aviation employees should strengthen their political study, carry forward the spirit of the November 9th uprising, eliminate the remaining negative influences left to us by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and establish a new ideology and style of serving the people. Everyone should work together with one heart and one mind to build a new type of civil aviation enterprise that does not rely on imperialism and completely serves the Chinese people.

　　Because China's industrial base is still very weak, we cannot yet establish large-scale civil aviation. Current civil aviation can only operate partially and to a limited extent. However, we have the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the support of nearly 500 million people, and the help of the advanced Soviet Union. Under these conditions, New China's civil aviation has a bright future. As we warmly celebrate the opening of civil aviation on August 1st, we sincerely wish all civil aviation employees to work hard and study hard, and strive to build New China's great civil aviation enterprise.

### 新中国民用航空的开始

　　新中国民用航空的开始
    北京号巨型机昨天在北京举行命名典礼。八月一日起，新中国的国内民用航空即将正式部分地通航了。这是新中国民航建设事业的重要的开端。在过去，中国人民是没有民用航空的。由于中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，战胜了美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派，中国人民遂能在短时期内初步建立起民用航空，开始通航。去年十一月九日，中国、中央两航空公司的起义，对于中国人民建设新的民航事业，创造了重要的条件。但是由于英美帝国主义的多方阻挠，使得两航公司留在香港的大部飞机和主要资财无法迁回。八个月来，全体民航员工在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，团结一致，克服种种困难，进行复员、内迁和清查器材等工作，为民用航空的通航和今后建设工作打下了初步的基础。
    在国民党反动统治时期，中国民用航空事业是在美德两帝国主义及国民党官僚资本的操纵之下的，是为帝国主义及国民党反动派服务的。尤其在最近十年来，国民党反动派利用它进行了许多反人民的活动。这种情况在今天已根本改变了。新中国的民用航空必须服务于人民，即必须为中国人民经济的政治的和文化的建设而服务。这是光荣的任务。但是，要能完成这种任务，全体民航员工应该加强政治学习，发扬去年十一月九日的起义精神，肃清过去帝国主义和国民党反动派所留给我们的残余的不良影响，树立为人民服务的新思想和新作风。大家应同心同德，努力建设起一个不依靠帝国主义的，完全服务于中国人民的新式的民用航空事业。
    由于中国的工业基础目前还非常薄弱，我们还不可能创办大规模的民用航空。目前的民用航空，还只能局部地有限度地通航。然而我们有中央人民政府的正确领导，有近五万万人民的支持，有先进的苏联盟邦的帮助，在这些条件之下，新中国民航事业是有光明前途的。当我们热烈庆祝八月一日民航通航的时候，我们谨祝全体民航员工努力工作学习，为建设新中国伟大的民用航空事业而奋斗。
