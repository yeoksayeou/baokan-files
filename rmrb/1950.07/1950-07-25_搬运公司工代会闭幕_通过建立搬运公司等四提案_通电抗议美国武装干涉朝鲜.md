　　Moving Company Labor Representatives Congress Concludes
    Passes Four Proposals Including Establishing a Moving Company
    Cables Protest Against American Armed Intervention in Korea
    [Reported by this newspaper] The first Workers' Representative Congress of the Beijing Moving Company, lasting three days, concluded successfully on the 22nd. The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of democracy and unity. On the second day of the meeting, the four proposals put forward by the presidium were discussed and passed: (1) Supporting the People's Government's proposal to establish a moving company. (2) Suggesting that the People's Government temporarily deduct 15 percent of the moving fee as a handling fee for the moving company. (3) Regarding the registration conditions and team formation principles for workers joining the company: Those who have participated in moving work for more than one year from the time of registration and whose main source of income is from moving labor can register to join the company with an introduction from the moving workers' union. Workers of the moving company must be members of the moving company's trade union. Those who do not meet the membership conditions can be hired as temporary workers at the discretion of the company, considering the current situation that there is not yet a severe surplus of moving workers in Beijing. The principles of team formation are: According to the needs of the moving work and specific labor conditions, teams can be formed for loading and unloading, large trucks, donkey carts, pushcarts (which can also be used for loading and unloading), and handcarts. At the same time, the technical conditions of workers, the strength of labor, and the size of vehicle transportation capacity should be taken into account to avoid excessive weakness or strength, which would affect the completion of transportation tasks. (4) Suggestions to the moving company regarding the principles of allocation: The principles for various vehicles and workers to move goods should be convenience of transportation and consideration of income. Convenience of transportation should be the main principle. Under this main principle, appropriate adjustments can be made if workers' incomes are too disparate. Moving contracts for large quantities of goods from large companies and factories throughout the city should be signed uniformly by the moving company, and the company will then uniformly allocate vehicles and workers for moving. Except for small cargo shipments, each office cannot independently sign large moving contracts. On the third day of the meeting, the congress elected Shu Jingsheng and eighteen others to form the Beijing Moving Company Trade Union Committee of the Chinese Moving Workers' Union, and issued a cable protesting against American armed intervention in Korea, expressing their respect to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army.
    Liu Zijiu, Minister of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting on the 21st and 22nd respectively. Minister Liu Zijiu, after explaining the significance of the conference, pointed out that in order to manage the moving company's business well, it is necessary to meet three conditions: rapid transportation, ensuring the safety of the goods carried, and low freight rates. He also encouraged moving workers to study hard, improve their culture and technology, so that they can use machinery in the future and complete new moving tasks by means of collective labor. Vice Chairman Xiao Ming analyzed the current situation in Korea, and then pointed out that trade union cadres should promote the spirit of democracy and overcome the style of coercion, commandism, and paternalism; workers should unite closely, and not compete to transport goods that are easy to transport and shirk goods that are difficult to transport; the ideology of guildism must be thoroughly eradicated, otherwise new separatist and monopolistic situations will arise in the moving industry, causing difficulties in transportation work.
    Through this meeting, the establishment of the moving company has become more firmly grounded, and the moving workers have unanimously recognized their responsibilities and future. From now on, Beijing's moving industry will present a new look.
    The telegram protesting against American armed intervention in Korea and expressing respect to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army stated:
    The armed aggression of American imperialism against our country's Taiwan and against the Korean people has completely exposed the ferocious and evil face of American imperialism in front of peace-loving people all over the world, arousing the anger of peace-loving people all over the world. The representatives of the first congress of workers of the Beijing Moving Company, the capital of China, representing 5,500 moving workers in Beijing, resolutely oppose the shameless atrocities of American imperialism and extend our high respect and cordial greetings to the heroic Korean military and civilians who are fighting against aggression. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. We firmly believe that your liberation war against the enslavement of the Korean people by American imperialism and its running dog, the Li Seung-man gang, will surely achieve final victory.

　　搬运公司工代会闭幕
    通过建立搬运公司等四提案   
    通电抗议美国武装干涉朝鲜
    【本报讯】北京市搬运公司第一次工人代表大会，历时三日，已于二十二日圆满结束。这次会议是在民主、团结的气氛中进行的。会议的第二天讨论并通过了主席团提出的四个提案：（一）拥护人民政府建立搬运公司案。（二）建议人民政府暂抽搬运费百分之十五做为搬运公司手续费案。（三）关于加入公司工人的登记条件编队原则案：从登记时起往前推，有一年以上参加搬运工作而又以搬运劳动收入为其生活主要来源者，经搬运工会介绍，便可登记参加公司。搬运公司工人必须是搬运公司工会的会员，其不够会员条件者，根据北京目前搬运工人尚不十分过剩的情况，可酌情雇请为临时工。编队原则是：根据搬运工作需要与具体劳动条件，可编成装卸队、大车队、驴车队、排子车队（可兼作装卸）、手车队，同时对工人技术条件、劳动力的强弱、车辆运输力的大小，要兼顾平均，以免过弱过强，影响运输任务的完成。（四）向搬运公司建议关于调配原则案：各种车辆，工人搬运货物的原则应是方便运输，照顾收入。方便运输应是主要的。在这一主要原则下，工人收入太悬殊的可实行适当的调剂。全市大公司、大工厂大批货物的搬运合同统一由搬运公司签订，公司再统一调配车辆、工人进行搬运。各办事处除零星货运外不能单独签订大的搬运合同。会议的第三天，大会选举了舒景生等十八人成立中国搬运工会北京市搬运公司工会委员会，并发出通电抗议美国武装干涉朝鲜，向朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军致敬。
    中华全国总工会文教部部长刘子久和北京市总工会副主席萧明曾分别在二十一日和二十二日到会讲话。刘子久部长在阐明了大会的意义后，指出要办好搬运公司的业务，必须做到运输迅速，保证承运货物的安全和运价低廉等三个条件。并勉励搬运工人努力学习，提高文化和技术，以便将来能使用机械，以集体劳动的方法，来完成新的搬运任务。萧明副主席分析了当前朝鲜的情势之后，紧接着指出工会干部应发扬民主精神，克服强迫命令包办代替的作风；工人要紧密团结，不要好运的货大家就争着运，不好运的大家就都推卸；行会主义的思想必须彻底肃清，否则搬运事业中又要产生新的割据把持局面，造成运输工作上的困难。
    经过这次会议，搬运公司的建立更有了基础，搬运工人一致认清了自己的责任和前途，从此北京市的搬运事业将呈现一新的气象。
    抗议美国武装干涉朝鲜，并向朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军致敬的电文中称：
    美国帝国主义对我国台湾和对朝鲜人民的武装进攻。在全世界爱好和平的人民面前，完全暴露了美帝国主义穷凶恶极的狰狞面孔，激起了全世界爱好和平的人民的愤怒。中国首都北京市搬运公司工人首届代表大会代表全北京市五千五百搬运工人，坚决反对美国帝国主义的无耻暴行，并向英勇抗战的朝鲜军民致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。中国人民决心要解放台湾。我们坚信你们反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮奴役朝鲜人民的解放战争一定得到最后胜利。
