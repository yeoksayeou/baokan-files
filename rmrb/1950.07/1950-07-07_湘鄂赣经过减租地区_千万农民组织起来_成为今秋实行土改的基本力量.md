Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 5th: In the vast rural areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces that have undergone rent reduction movements, more than 11 million peasants have been organized, becoming the basic force for implementing land reform after this autumn. At the same time, rural political power has also been preliminarily transformed during the rent reduction, establishing rural people's political power and establishing the political advantage of the peasants. According to recent statistics: 80 percent of the villages in Hubei province have established peasant associations, with a total of 4.4 million members; in Hunan province, 9,564 villages out of 14,830 villages have established peasant associations, with a total of 5.73 million members; in Jiangxi province, a total of 12,850 villages have peasant association organizations, accounting for 81 percent of all villages in the province, with a total of more than 1.3 million members.

The establishment of peasant associations in various places generally takes the following steps. When peasants request to be organized, the county or district peasant representative conference passes a resolution to first establish a preparatory committee for the peasant association. At the same time, at these representative conferences, outstanding members among the peasant representatives are absorbed as basic members of the peasant association through democratic appraisal and leadership review and approval. Then, these basic members return to the village to develop members and establish village-level peasant association organizations. In view of the fact that the initial peasant representatives may not be pure, it is specifically stipulated that the peasant associations established in each village must be approved by the superior peasant association organization. In places where this method is used, the development of peasant organizations is very rapid. For example, in Xishui County, Hubei Province, 40,000 members were developed in one month. Conversely, in some areas of the Yichang Special District, because rural work cadres adopted individual and secret development methods, the development of peasant associations in these areas was very slow. Many counties only developed one hundred members in a month. After the peasant association organization was established, it united the vast number of peasants in the village to carry out rent reduction struggles, consolidated and expanded the organization of the peasant association in the struggle; and gradually purged the bad elements. At the end of April, Hunan Province had a total of 3 million peasant association members, and in May, when the rent reduction movement was deepened, it increased by 2.7 million. Now the peasant associations in Jiangxi Province and Hubei Province are starting to rectify their organizations and continue to develop members in order to further strengthen the peasant forces.

In places where peasants are organized, most villages have established the political power of the people's democratic dictatorship. In Hubei Province, out of 15,956 villages, 13,400 villages have abolished the Baojia system; in Hunan Province, except for western Hunan, most villages have established people's political power; and in Jiangxi Province, 35 percent of the rural political power has been transformed. The rural people's political power has mostly established militia self-defense armed forces, which have become an important force for consolidating the rural people's dictatorship. The militia in Hubei and Hunan provinces already number 240,000.

### 湘鄂赣经过减租地区  千万农民组织起来  成为今秋实行土改的基本力量

　　湘鄂赣经过减租地区
    千万农民组织起来
    成为今秋实行土改的基本力量
    【新华社汉口五日电】湖南、湖北、江西三省经过减租运动的广大农村中，已经有一千一百多万农民组织起来，成为今年秋后实行土地改革的基本力量。同时，农村政权在减租中也有初步改造，建立了乡村人民政权，树立了农民的政治优势。据最近统计：湖北全省已经有百分之八十的村庄建立了农民协会，共有会员四百四十万人；湖南省一万四千八百三十个村庄中，也已经有九千五百六十四个村建立了农会，共有会员五百七十三万人；江西省已经有农会组织的村庄共一万二千八百五十个，占该省全部村庄的百分之八十一，共有会员一百三十余万人。
    各地农民协会的建立一般是采取了如下的步骤。当农民要求组织起来时，县或区的农民代表会议就通过决定，先成立农民协会的筹备会。同时，在这些代表会议上，通过民主评议、领导上审查批准的方式，吸收农民代表中的优秀分子为农民协会的基本会员。然后，这些基本会员就回村去发展会员，成立村的农会组织。鉴于初期的农民代表可能不纯洁，所以特别明确规定，各村建立的农民协会必须经过上级农会组织的批准。在减租中，凡运用这种方式的地方，农民组织的发展就很快。如湖北省浠水县，在一个月内就发展了四万会员。相反的，在宜昌专区的部分地区，因为农村工作干部采取个别的秘密的发展方式，这些地区农会的发展就很慢。许多县份一个月只发展了一百名会员。农民协会组织建立起来后，团结村中广大的农民，进行减租斗争，在斗争中巩固和扩大了农协的组织；并且逐渐清洗了坏分子。湖南省四月底农会会员共有三百万人，在减租运动深入开展的五月份内就增加了二百七十万人。现在江西省和湖北省的农协，为着进一步壮大农民力量，都在开始整顿组织和继续发展会员。
    在农民组织起来了的地方，多数乡村都建立了乡村人民民主专政的政权。湖北全省一万五千九百五十六个村庄，已经有一万三千四百个村庄废除了保甲制；湖南省除湘西以外，大部乡村都建立了人民政权；江西省也有百分之三十五的乡村政权已经得到改造。乡村人民政权多已建立有民兵自卫武装，成为巩固乡村人民专政的一支重要力量。湖北、湖南两省的民兵即已有二十四万人。
