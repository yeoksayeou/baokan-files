　　North China Military Region Troops Stationed in Beijing Say:
	Truman Can't Scare Us, We Will Definitely Defeat Him
　　[Report from this newspaper] Upon hearing Truman's arrogant statement, the officers and soldiers of the North China Military Region troops stationed in Beijing were all eager to fight and extremely indignant. They expressed their resolute support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. They unanimously believed that Taiwan is our territory, and liberating Taiwan is the glorious task of the People's Liberation Army. Qiu Runchuan, a special-class meritorious person in the Xinxiang Campaign from the Eighth Company of a certain regiment, said: "Truman doesn't need to bluff. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek's New Sixth Army was all American equipment, but we still wiped it out completely!" Zhang Yaojun, a reconnaissance员 from the Jidong operations, said that in 1946, in Hongshui Village, west of Zunhua City, three American cars and a fully armed traitor team attacked us, and our company only took fifteen minutes to resolve the battle. We are not afraid of Truman squeaking and yelling. We must remember Chairman Mao's words, make full preparations, and train hard. If the American imperialists dare to invade us, we will eliminate one if they come, and eliminate two if they come as a pair. The units of the Military Region Aviation Department held discussion meetings separately. Everyone spoke enthusiastically and unanimously supported Chairman Mao's instructions and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Everyone expressed that they would work and study harder, improve their skills, raise their vigilance, and make full preparations to crush Truman's statement and the American imperialist aggression. Zhao Wenhua, the combat hero of the Provost Corps, and Xiao Chenghuan, the gunner who had rendered meritorious service, also said: We must step up preparations to defeat the American imperialist challenge conspiracy; we must redouble our efforts to strengthen various duties, prevent enemy agents from taking the opportunity to carry out activities, and protect the order of the capital.
