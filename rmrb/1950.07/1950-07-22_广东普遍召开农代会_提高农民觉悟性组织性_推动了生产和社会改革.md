Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th. From March and April to the end of June, sixty-two of the eighty-three counties in Guangdong Province (excluding Hainan Island), two hundred and eighty-eight districts, and five hundred and seventy-eight townships have convened one to three farmer representative conferences. According to incomplete statistics, approximately two hundred thousand farmer representatives were elected or invited to participate in the meetings. The farmer representative conferences in various regions have generally achieved great success. These conferences have enhanced the awareness and organization of the peasant masses, thereby enabling the rapid development of rural production and social reform movements. This spring, the people's governments in various regions conveyed the ten major policies for spring plowing production of the Central-South Military and Political Committee at the farmer representative conferences. As a result, these policies were supported by the broad masses of farmers, quickly stabilizing the fluctuations caused by rumors spread by special agents, sabotage by landlords, and certain deviations in grain requisition work. Rent reduction and rent refunds, flood prevention, and surviving the famine were also important topics of discussion at farmer representative conferences at all levels during this period. After discussions at the meetings, the farmers' mentality of solely relying on government relief and their feelings of disappointment were overcome, and the rent reduction movement and flood prevention and dike repair work in various regions were able to proceed smoothly. The convening of farmer representative conferences at all levels has also enabled the rapid development of farmers' organizations. For example, in the Yuezhong area, there were more than 32,000 members of farmers' associations in February, and by May, the number of members had increased to more than 316,000.

　　广东普遍召开农代会
    提高农民觉悟性组织性  推动了生产和社会改革
    【新华社广州十九日电】广东省八十三个县中（海南岛除外），从三、四月间开始至六月底止，已有六十二个县、二百八十八个区、五百七十八个乡召开过一次至三次农民代表会议。据不完全统计：被选举或被聘请参加会议的农民代表约有二十万人。各地农民代表会议一般都收到了很大的成效。这些会议提高了农民群众的觉悟性和组织性，因而使农村生产和社会改革运动得以迅速开展。如今春各地人民政府都在农民代表会议上传达了中南军政委员会的春耕生产十大政策，结果这些政策获得了广大农民的拥护，迅速稳定了因特务造谣、地主破坏及征粮工作的某些偏差而引起的波动。减租退租、防汛度荒也是这时期各级农民代表会议中讨论的重要议题。经过会议讨论，农民单纯依赖政府救济的思想和失望情绪被克服了，各地的减租运动和防汛修堤工作遂得以顺利进行。各级农民代表会议的召开也使农民的组织获得迅速发展。如粤中区在二月间有农民协会会员三万二千余人，到五月间农民协会会员便增加到三十一万六千多人。
