Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: TASS Moscow, July 20th - On July 11th, the British Ambassador to Moscow, Kelly, spoke to Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko regarding the Korean question. He said that the British government is bound by the recent resolutions of the Security Council and cannot, at present, put forward definite suggestions regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The British government considers it is too early to put forward such suggestions. At the same time, Ambassador Kelly stated that the British government believes that, as a preliminary suggestion, the war in Korea should be stopped, and the North Korean army should withdraw to the 38th parallel, which is necessary.

On July 17th, Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko told Kelly that the Soviet government believes that the best way to peacefully resolve the Korean problem is to convene a Security Council meeting with representatives of the People's Republic of China participating, and that the opinions of the Korean people's representatives should be presented when deciding on the Korean issue. As for the British government's preliminary suggestion, Gromyko told the ambassador that, to avoid being premature, this preliminary suggestion, like all other suggestions, should be submitted to the Security Council for discussion.

Kelly replied that he would convey the contents of the Soviet government's statement to the British government.

　　葛罗米柯向英大使声明
    苏对朝鲜问题立场
    和平解决朝鲜问题的最好办法是召开中国代表参加的安理会
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：七月十一日，英国驻莫斯科大使凯莱就朝鲜问题对外交部副部长葛罗米柯说，英国政府受安全理事会最近的决议的约束，目前不能提出关于和平解决朝鲜问题的确定的建议，英国政府认为提出这样的建议将为时过早。同时，凯莱大使声明，英国政府认为，作为初步的建议，朝鲜的战争应该停止，而北朝鲜的军队应退回三八线，这是必要的。
    七月十七日，外交部副部长葛罗米柯对凯莱说，苏联政府认为和平解决朝鲜问题的最好办法，是召开必须有中国人民政府代表参加的安全理事会，而在决定朝鲜问题的时候应由朝鲜人民代表陈述意见。至于英国政府的初步建议，葛罗米柯对大使说，为了避免为时过早，这个初步的建议正如所有其他的建议一样，应该交给安全理事会讨论。
    凯莱回答说，他将把苏联政府声明的内容传达给英国政府。
