　　Planted with the Plow, Harvested with the Hoe
    Third Round of Summer Weeding Begins in Northeast China
    Simultaneous Topdressing and Manure Application Promotes Vigorous Seedling Growth
    [Our Newspaper] Northeast China's rural areas have largely entered the third round of summer weeding. Governments at all levels are intensifying leadership to ensure the timely completion of plans for multiple cultivations. Currently, with the exception of Heilongjiang Province, where the season is later, most other areas are carrying out three cultivations and three hoeings. Some mutual aid groups using new farm tools have completed three cultivations and three hoeings and are entering the fourth round of summer weeding.
    This year's summer weeding work in Northeast China started seven or eight days earlier than last year. Coupled with the use of a large number of new farm tools, the universal organization of mutual aid groups, and the rational use of labor, it is estimated that the weeding will be completed five to ten days earlier than in previous years. The three provinces of Songjiang, Liaodong, and Liaoxi are expected to conclude summer weeding by the 15th of this month.
    After the first and second rounds of hoeing and cultivation were completed in various areas, many farmers and some district and village cadres did not fully understand the benefits of multiple cultivations for increased grain production. Furthermore, the rapid progress of this year's weeding led to complacency, making people unwilling to do additional cultivation, or hoeing without cultivation. Upon discovering this, leading organs used various methods to educate cadres and farmers about the advantages of multiple cultivations, with great success. For example, in Changling County, Jilin Province, cadres in the Chengguan District had Li Xinfa of Dongliuhao Village share his experience of achieving higher grain yields last year through multiple cultivations. This motivated all the farmers in the village to plan for an additional round of cultivation, and encouraged areas with better production conditions and mutual aid groups to strive for more cultivations than originally planned. For instance, the Jilin Han'en group, using new horse-drawn farm tools, is currently carrying out four cultivations and four hoeings. In Boli County, Songjiang Province, forty percent of the land that was plowed last autumn can achieve four cultivations and four hoeings.
    During this year's summer weeding, Northeast China not only strived for multiple cultivations, but also applied substantial topdressing and manure to crops. During the second round of cultivation, farmers in many areas of Liaodong, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Songjiang provinces applied fertilizer to soybeans, sorghum, corn, and other crops to increase grain production. Some districts and villages in Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces, which had traditionally only applied fertilizer once, also broke with old habits and applied fertilizer along with the hoeing after the second cultivation. Crops that have been supplemented with manure and topdressing are now growing better than ordinary crops. For example, in Guangyi Village, Lanleng District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, Ben Yuwen's millet seedlings, which have been supplemented with manure, are already one and a half feet tall, while Su Bangqing's millet seedlings, which have not been supplemented, are still less than one foot tall.

### 种在犁上收在锄上  东北夏锄进入第三遍  同时追肥补粪禾苗生长旺盛

　　种在犁上收在锄上
    东北夏锄进入第三遍
    同时追肥补粪禾苗生长旺盛
    【本报讯】东北大部农村已进入第三遍夏锄。各级政府正抓紧领导，以便及时完成多铲多趟的计划。目前除季节较晚的黑龙江省外，其他大部地区正进行三铲三趟。部分使用新农具的互助组，已完成三铲三趟进入第四遍夏锄。
    今年东北夏锄工作，由于开始较去年早七、八天，加上大批新农具下地，以及普遍组织了互助组，合理使用劳力等原因，据目前情形估计将比往年提早五天到十天完成铲趟。松江、辽东、辽西三省，本月十五日即可结束夏锄。
    各地夏锄在一、二遍铲趟完成后，虽有不少农民和部分区村干部，对多铲多趟多打粮食认识不足，再加今年铲趟迅速，因而滋长了自满情绪，不愿多铲多趟，或铲了不趟。领导机关发现后，便针对干部和农民这种思想情况，用各种方法进行多铲多趟的好处的教育，收效甚大。如吉林省长岭县城关区干部，让东六号村李新发介绍去年多铲多趟一遍，多打粮食的实例，因此使全村农民都计划要多铲趟一遍，并推动生产条件较好的地区和互助小组争取较原计划多铲趟一遍。如使用新式马拉农具的吉林韩恩小组正进行四铲四趟。松江省勃利县不少地区百分之四十的耲槎地（即去年秋耕过的地）可以做到四铲四趟。
    在今年夏锄中，东北各地不但努力作到多铲多趟，并且大量给庄稼追肥补粪。如在二遍铲趟进行中，辽东、吉林、黑龙江、松江各省不少地区的农民为了增产粮食，即为大豆、高粱、玉茭等庄稼追肥补粪。许多年来，一向是只施肥一次的黑龙江、松江两省部分区村，也打破了旧习惯，在二遍铲完时随趟随追肥。经过补粪追肥的庄稼，现在比一般的庄稼都长得好。如松江省双城县兰棱区广益村贲玉文补过粪的谷苗已有一尺半高，而苏邦庆未补粪的谷苗尚不足一尺。
