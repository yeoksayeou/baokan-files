　　Peixiezhuang Female Party Secretary Liu Xiurong Transforms Loafer Hu Jinsheng

　　Liu Xiurong is the female Party branch secretary of Peixiezhuang, Handan. She is consistently active in her work and discusses difficulties with the masses. Therefore, the village's work is never behind. There was only one thing that made her feel troubled. Her village had a Hu Jinsheng, who returned from the puppet army after the liberation of Handan. He lived in his brother-in-law's house (who is a farmer in Peixiezhuang), wandering around every day without working. Later, his brother-in-law got him a wife and bought him a horse-drawn cart. However, the money he earned every day was not enough for the livestock and himself. Helpless, his brother-in-law gave him three rooms, half an acre of land, and a bag of wheat last June, separating them to live independently. But he still idled around. After a few days, the grain was gone. He begged from door to door, which made people very disgusted with him. Liu Xiurong thought every day: "If he can be transformed, the village's work will be better. But how can he be transformed?" Liu Xiurong couldn't think of a good way. Finally, she made up her mind to use a simple method to educate him: talk to him more about principles. Because the village is not big, and everyone lives close by, she would talk to him whenever they met. If she spoke to him often enough and for long enough, perhaps he could be transformed. Comrade Liu Xiurong's first conversation with him was last September: "Jinsheng, everyone else has taken good care of their land. You are only twenty-five or six years old, and your half acre of land is full of weeds. This is really unsightly! Besides, if you don't grow any grain, you will starve in the winter!" After hearing this, Hu Jinsheng felt that these were useless words and replied: "I am just this kind of person, I can't do anything!" After that, Comrade Liu Xiurong talked to him twice more, but still could not make him change. But Comrade Liu Xiurong did not lose heart because of this. In October, Hu Jinsheng's wife gave birth to a baby, and the family had nothing to eat after finishing one meal. If he borrowed, others were afraid that he would not repay; if he wanted to do a small business, he had no capital. Just when he was worried that there was no way out, Comrade Liu Xiurong lent him 10,000 yuan. Jinsheng went to buy some radishes and other vegetables to sell, and later traded jujubes, and also worked as a porter in his spare time. He worked like this for a winter, and in addition to maintaining the life of his wife, children and himself, he also paid off 10,000 yuan of debt. But after the New Year, his life was still without any way out. Comrade Liu Xiurong introduced him to the mutual aid production team of Jiang Guisheng in the village (the team originally had ten people, formed voluntarily. They do farm work when they are busy, and make adobe and build walls in their spare time, etc.).

　　As usual, the people in the mutual aid team got up to work before dawn. But Hu Jinsheng got up late. Others went to his door early in the morning to call him. The team often made suggestions to him and educated him. In this way, with everyone's patient help, after four or five months, Hu Jinsheng completely changed his past lazy habits and actively participated in labor. This year, in addition to planting his own land well, he also made adobe and built walls. From mid-January to mid-April, in three months, he was allocated 420 kilograms of rice. In addition, his wife also did some knitting work to earn some money. The whole family had a surplus in addition to food and clothing. When others talked to him about his life, he always said happily: "Thanks to Liu Xiurong and everyone's help. Otherwise, my whole family would have starved!"

　　裴谢庄女支书刘秀荣改造懒汉胡金声
    刘秀荣是邯郸镇裴谢庄的女支部书记。她对工作一贯积极，遇到困难就和群众商量。因此，村上的工作样样都不落后。就是有一件事使她感到了为难。她村上有个胡金声，从邯郸解放那年由伪军里回来后，住在他姐夫（是裴谢庄一农民）家里，每天东溜西逛的不干活。后来他姐夫给娶了媳妇，又给买了马车。但他每天挣的钱还不够牲口和自己吃用。无奈何他姐夫才在去年六月给他匀了三间房，半亩地、一口袋麦子，把他俩口分出去独立生活。但是他仍然游手好闲。过了些日子粮食又吃完了。他东讨西借，惹得人们都很讨厌他。刘秀荣每天想着：“能把他改造过来，村上的工作就更好作了。但是，怎样才能把他改造过来呢？”刘秀荣却一直想不出好办法来。最后她下定了决心，就用个笨法子来教育他：多给他讲道理吧。因为村子不大，大家又住的不远。见了面就说，说的次数多了，时间长了，或许能把他改造过来。刘秀荣同志第一次给他谈话是在去年九月里：“金声，别人都把地侍弄好哩。你才二十五、六岁，自己的半亩地满地是草，这实在太不好看了！再说打不出粮食，冬天也得挨饿呀！”胡金声听了以后觉得这是些无用的话，就回答说：“咱就是这样的人，啥事也干不了！”此后，刘秀荣同志又和他谈了两次，也还是不能使他有什么转变。但刘秀荣同志没有因此而灰心。到了十月里，胡金声媳妇生下了一个小娃娃，家里吃了上顿就摸不到下顿。去借吧，别人却怕他借了没还；想干点小买卖又没有本钱。正在愁着没办法的时候，刘秀荣同志就借给他一万元。金声就去买些萝葡和别的蔬菜之类来卖，后又贩卖枣子，抽空还到脚行干点活。这样干了一个冬季，除维持老婆、小孩及个人的生活之外，还偿清了一万元的账。但年关一过，他的生活还是没有一点办法。刘秀荣同志就把他介绍到本村姜桂生的生产互助组（小组原有十人，为自愿结合而成。忙时干农活，抽空就打坯打墙等）。
    互助组的人，照例不到天明就起床工作。胡金声却起得晚。别人在清早就到门上去喊他。组里并经常向他提意见，对他进行教育。就这样在大家的耐心帮助下，经过了四、五个月的时间，胡金声就完全改变了过去懒惰的习惯，积极参加了劳动。今年他除把自己的土地种好外，又打坯、打墙。从一月半到四月半三个月就分到了四百二十斤米。加上老婆也作些针织活，赚些钱。全家除了吃穿，还有剩余。别人和他谈起他的生活，他总是高兴地说：“亏得刘秀荣和大家对我的帮助。要不然，我一家老小就得挨饿！”
