One Thousand Days Without Accidents
    On Locomotive No. 1102 of the Suihua Locomotive Depot
    Zhao Chun
    Locomotive No. 1102 of the Suihua Locomotive Depot under the Harbin Railway Administration gloriously surpassed 200,000 safe kilometers from September 3, 1947, to May 28 of this year. In two years and nine months, the assigned crew did not relax for a moment, and finally achieved one thousand days without accidents. Now, the group is striving towards the goal of 300,000 safe kilometers.
        
        Overcoming Hot Axles
    Locomotive No. 1102 used to be a locomotive prone to hot axles. It would require seventy or eighty kilograms of hard grease for one trip, and the axles had to be braced at every station. On September 2, 1947, at Shiyi Station, all the crew members were busy bracing the axles and forgot to throw the switch, resulting in an illegal transportation accident and erasing more than 20,000 safe kilometers. At that time, the morale of the group was greatly affected, and they all said: "This locomotive is a waste of effort." The driver chief Zhang Guoqing patiently explained to the workers and led the group to study solutions, closely connecting with the factory to carefully tell the factory about the locomotive's problems. They also studied flat oil meshes, improved the method of storing oil to keep it clean, and washed all the large and small oil tanks during scheduled inspections to prevent sand from entering. In addition, they paid attention to operation during duty, fully supplying oil, thus gradually overcoming the problem of hot axles and boosting the morale and confidence of the workers.

            Learning from Iron Steed
    After the old Iron Steed locomotive No. 96 broke through 100,000 kilometers of Class A inspection in the winter of 1948, it gave locomotive No. 1102 a great encouragement. Driver chief Zhang Guoqing immediately encouraged the workers, saying: "Turn your aspirations into strength, be determined to learn from the responsible spirit of Iron Steed, and step up your efforts to catch up." He then led the group to study the establishment of a system, clarified the division of labor, and implemented personal responsibility. One person each was selected as the head of the technical, coal-saving, accident prevention, and cleaning groups. The technical group leader was responsible for leading the study of technical regulations, locomotive theory, etc.; the coal-saving group leader led the study of coal-saving methods; the accident prevention group leader was responsible for leading the study of accident prevention methods, establishing an "accident warning" record to record accident materials from various places, and regularly contacting the group for review to raise vigilance; the cleaning group leader was responsible for leading the locomotive cleaning work. From then on, the group's work improved day by day, and no accidents occurred until "May Day" last year, and the assigned crew made a great contribution.
            
            Establishing a System and Persisting to the End
    In June of last year, the original driver chief Zhang Guoqing was promoted to instructor driver, and the original driver Wang Zhenxue was promoted to driver chief. In order to guard against arrogance and prevent accidents, Wang Zhenxue led the group to re-establish a handover system: the handover driver would tell the receiving driver in detail about the locomotive's deficiencies and check them together; the receiving assistant driver would check the axles and the oil supply status of each part, and the handover assistant driver would help with oil supply and stove cleaning; the handover fireman would tell the receiving fireman about the places where oil was lacking, and the receiving fireman would supply oil, etc. Because of thorough handover and clear grasp of the locomotive's condition, it was not easy to make mistakes. An oil supply system was also established, stipulating that the fireman was responsible for daily oil supply, and that each oil supply officer was specifically responsible for the oil supply work of each part during scheduled inspections. The shout system was improved: when shouting, face inward so as not to be unheard; do not wait or estimate during execution, and shout if you cannot see clearly to prompt the driver to pay attention. In addition, the three-shovel system was improved. In the past, workers found the mechanical three-shovel method inconvenient and became chaotic as soon as they took office. This time, the division of labor was based on the condition of the line and the degree of fire determination combustion, improving incineration technology, saving coal, and establishing locomotive status books, transmission books, etc. Every worker paid special attention to all kinds of systems on the locomotive, and insisted on them without any slack for two years and nine months. In order to improve work and raise the political awareness of the crew, it was decided to launch criticism and self-criticism and establish a root-tracing system. For example, Qi Guisheng was prone to making mistakes, and repeated assistance did not change him, so the reasons were traced and preventive measures were formulated, which also promptly raised everyone's attention.
            
            Unity, Friendship, and Helping Progress
    In June of 1949, due to personnel transfers, two or three new workers were replaced, causing the group's pace to become inconsistent. Driver chief Wang Zhenxue immediately proposed to strengthen unity, take the initiative to unite new workers, and patiently persuade them. For example, driver Zhou Chengli, an old worker who had just been transferred from Harbin, became ill as soon as he was transferred, with blood in his stool, and had to pull over at almost every water station. After the driver chief discovered this, he mobilized him to be hospitalized for recuperation and often went to visit and comfort him. The group workers also often went to his home, and if they found that there was no firewood, they would immediately send it. Old Zhou was very touched, and worked particularly hard after he recovered. Worker Zhao Shiqing was reinstated later, and was not very motivated in his work, and his oil supply was not thorough. Wang Zhenxue often advised him: "It is not easy for the factory to repair the locomotive, so we must pay attention to maintaining it." In order to take care of his family's difficulties, the group lent him money and gave him more bonuses, etc. Wang Zhenxue also mobilized Zhao's family to engage in sideline production, so his life was improved, and Zhao was motivated to become active. Therefore, the whole group was united and full of enthusiasm for work.

            Leadership of the Party, Government, Labor Union, and Youth League, and the Powerful Cooperation of Family Members
    Locomotive No. 1102's ability to break through 200,000 safe kilometers is inseparable from the leadership of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league. Before departure, the Party and Youth League branches and the sports director gave specific instructions on the work and introduced the work and accident situation of other groups to raise attention. The instructor driver personally participated in the group meeting for guidance.

    Because the labor union group leader and labor protection cadres often visited the homes of the workers to help each family solve difficulties, they also influenced the family members to become active. For example, Zhou Chengli's wife organized a meeting of family members and proposed to ensure that male workers were not asked to do odd jobs at home so that male workers could fully recuperate and work well. Therefore, the family members also brought glorious flowers to this celebration meeting.

　　千日无事故
    记绥化机务段一一○二号机车
    赵椿
    哈尔滨铁路管理局绥化机务段一一○二号机车，从一九四七年九月三日到今年五月二十八日，光荣地突破了二十万安全公里，在两年零九个月中，包车组没有松过一口气，终于达成了千日无事故。现在，该组又在向三十万安全公里的目标奋斗着。
        克服大轴发热
    一一○二号机车过去是一台最好热轴的机车。一趟车就得使七、八十公斤硬干油，站站得挽轴。一九四七年九月二日在石伊站，因全班乘务员忙着挽轴而忘了甩车，造成违法运输事故，打消了二万多安全公里。当时小组情绪大受影响，都说：“这台车是费力不讨好。”司机长张国卿就耐心的向工友们解释，并领导小组研究克服办法，密切和工厂连系，把机车毛病细心的告诉工厂；并研究平油网子，改进保管油的方法，保持住油的洁净；定检时把大小油箱等都洗一遍，以防有砂子；再加上乘务中注意操纵，充分给油，因此逐渐克服了热轴的毛病，提起了工友们的情绪和信心。
            学习铁牛号
    一九四八年冬老铁牛九六号机车突破十万甲检公里以后，给一一○二机车一个很大的鼓舞。司机长张国卿立即向工友们鼓动说：“把志愿变成力量，下决心学习铁牛号的负责精神，加一把劲赶上去。”继即领导小组研究建立制度，明确分工，实行专人负责。并选出技术、节煤、防止事故、清洁等组长各一人。技术组长负责领导学习技术规程、机车理论等；节煤组长领导研究节煤办法；防止事故组长负责领导研究防止事故办法，设立“事故警报”记录，记载各地事故材料，并经常联系本组进行检讨，提高警惕；清洁组长负责领导机车清扫工作。从此，小组工作日有起色，到去年“五一”没有发生事故，包车组立了一大功。
            建立制度坚持到底
    去年六月，原司机长张国卿提升指导司机，原司机王振学提为司机长。为警戒骄傲、防止事故，王振学就领导小组重新建立接交班制度：交班司机将机车不良处所详细告诉接班司机，并共同检查；接班副司机检查大轴及各部给油状态，交班副司机帮助给油和清炉工作；交班司炉把缺油地方告诉接班司炉，由接班司炉给油等。由于彻底交接，明确掌握机车情况，故不容易出错误。又建立了给油制度，规定日常给油由司炉负责，定检时有各给油干事专负责各部给油工作。改进呼喊制度：呼喊时要面向里，以免听不见；执行中不等待，不估计，如看不清时就喊，以促使司机注意。此外并改进了三锹制。过去机械的使用三锹办法，工友们感到不便，一上岗就乱了。这回根据线路状态，火定燃烧程度分工，提高焚火技术，节省煤炭，建立机车状态簿、传达簿等。机车上所有的各种制度，每个工友都特别注意，两年九个月中，始终是一刻不松劲的坚持着。为改进工作，提高乘务员的政治认识，并决定展开批评和自我批评，建立追根制度。如齐贵生好出错误，屡次帮助不改，就追出原因，订出了防止办法，也及时提起了大家注意。
            团结友爱帮助进步
    一九四九年六月间，因人员调动，换上了二、三名新工友，使小组步调不一致了。司机长王振学当即提出加强团结，主动团结新工友，耐心说服，如司机周成礼，是新从哈尔滨调来的老工友，刚转来就有病，大肠走血，差不多每个给水站都得拉一遍。司机长发现后，就动员他入院休养，并经常去探望安慰，小组工友也常上他家去，发现没有烧的，马上就给送去。老周非常受感动，病好后干的特别起劲。赵世清工友是后复职的，工作不大起劲，给油不彻底。王振学就经常劝告他：“工厂修车不容易，咱们得注意保持才行。”为照顾他家庭困难，小组又借给他钱，多分给奖金等等。王振学并发动赵的家属搞副业生产，因而生活得到改善，赵被感动的积极起来了。因此全组团结一致，工作情绪饱满积极。
            党政工团的领导与家属的有力配合
    一一○二机车能够突破二十万安全公里，和党、政、工、团的领导是分不开的。在出乘前党、团支部及运动主任对工作中具体指示，介绍其他组的工作及事故情况，以提起注意。指导司机亲自参加小组会进行指导。
    由于工会小组长和劳保干部经常到各工友家去访问，帮助各家解决困难，也影响家属积极起来了。如周成礼的爱人组织家属开会，提出保证不叫男工友回家作零活，使男工友充分休养，好好工作。因此这次开庆功会家属也都带上了光荣花。
