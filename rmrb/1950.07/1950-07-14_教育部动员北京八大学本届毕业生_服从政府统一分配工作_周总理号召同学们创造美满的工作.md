　　The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, in order to uniformly assign jobs to this semester's graduates from various universities in Beijing, convened a mobilization meeting for unified job assignment in the auditorium of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing on the 11th. The meeting was attended by this year's graduates from eight colleges and universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Agricultural University, and the Hui Nationality College. A total of more than 1,300 graduating students attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Minister of Education Ma Xulun. Premier Zhou Enlai of the Government Administration Council, Vice Premier Guo Moruo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Government Administration Council Sun Qimeng, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xiao Hua, Vice Minister of Education Wei Que, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Education Hao Renchu, and Deputy Director of the Higher Education Department Zhang Zonglin also attended the meeting. Minister Ma Xulun spoke first. After explaining the significance of the meeting, he pointed out that it was unprecedented for the government to be responsible for assigning jobs to graduates of Chinese universities. In the past, graduation meant unemployment for students, but today, under the management of the People's Government, there are not enough graduates to fill the available positions. He called on the students to make full ideological preparations, obey government assignments, and resolutely serve the people.

　　Next, Vice Premier Guo Moruo spoke. He said that job assignments should be made as appropriate as possible, so that students can make the best use of their talents in their positions. However, since the country has only recently been founded, there are priorities in the work, so it may not be possible to fully satisfy every student. He hoped that students would obey assignments and work actively in their positions.

　　Premier Zhou pointed out in his speech that the direction of students' work should be towards a new life. He said: Only by heading in the direction of a new life can we see a bright future. Students may not have the most fulfilling jobs when they first leave school; fulfilling jobs must be created through hard work. The new China has only just been born and needs us to work hard to create it. Therefore, when assigning our work, we should not only look at today, but also at future development. And we should not be afraid of difficulties, but constantly overcome them in development. We should see that only by overcoming difficulties can we gain experience and develop. He called on the students to bravely accept the assigned work with the attitude of working wherever we are placed. If some of the students have already found jobs themselves and can still serve the people, they also have the right to raise the issue, and the government should consider it, but this is only a minority. Most students will accept the government's assignment and become public servants. Finally, he pointed out that students should show courage and work hard with self-improvement.

　　Deputy Director of the General Political Department Xiao Hua expressed his welcome to the students to participate in the glorious construction work of the army. Vice Minister of Education Wei Que called on everyone to abandon the burdens of family and personal interests and work hard for the interests of the people.

　　教育部动员北京八大学本届毕业生
    服从政府统一分配工作
    周总理号召同学们创造美满的工作
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府教育部为统一分配本学期北京各大学毕业生的工作，于十一日在北京辅仁大学礼堂召集北京大学、清华大学、师范大学、燕京大学、中法大学、辅仁大学、农业大学、回民学院等八院、校的本届毕业生，举行统一分配工作的动员大会。到会毕业同学共计一千三百余人。大会由教育部部长马叙伦主持，政务院周总理、郭副总理，政务院副秘书长孙起孟，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华，教育部副部长韦悫、办公厅副主任郝人初、高等教育司副司长张宗麟等均到会。马叙伦部长首先讲话。他在说明开会的意义后，指出：中国高等学校毕业生由政府负责分配工作还是开天辟地的事。过去学生毕业即是失业，今天在人民政府的管理下却是毕业生不够分配。他号召同学们作充分的思想准备，服从政府分配，坚决为人民服务。
    继由郭沫若副总理讲话。他说：分配工作要尽可能作到适才适用，使同学在工作岗位上各尽所能；但今天国家刚刚成立不久，工作的进行有轻重缓急之分，因此不一定能使每一同学都十分满意，希望同学们能服从分配，到工作岗位后积极工作。
    周总理在讲话中，指出同学工作的方向，应该是走向新生的方向。他说：向着新生的方向，才能看到远大的前途。同学们一出校门不一定能有最美满的工作；美满的工作要在努力中创造出来。新中国还是刚刚诞生，须要我们努力创造它。因此，分配我们的工作不要只看到今天，而要看到将来的发展。并且不要怕困难，而要在发展中不断地克服困难。应该看到，只有在克服困难中才能得到锻炼和发展。他号召同学们应当以把我们放在那里，就在那里工作的态度，勇敢地接受所分配的工作。如果同学们当中，有的已经自己寻找了职业而一样可以为人民服务的话，也有权利提出，政府应该加以考虑，但，这只是少数，大多数同学将要接受政府的分配成为公家人。最后他指出同学们要拿出勇气来，自强不息地努力工作。
    总政治部萧华副主任在讲话中表示欢迎同学们参加部队的光荣建设工作。教育部韦悫副部长在讲话中号召大家放弃家庭的包袱和个人利益的包袱，为人民的利益而努力工作。
