　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 2nd: The Polish News Agency reported: The Polish government has received a report from the Secretary-General of the United Nations regarding the "resolution" concerning the situation in Korea passed by six members of the Security Council. Prior to this, US President Truman had already ordered the US armed forces to begin aggressive military actions in the Far East, namely, interfering in Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and directly participating in the Korean War.

　　From this, it can be seen that the report submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the Polish government can only be regarded as a further implementation of the infamous Truman Doctrine. This doctrine, announced three years ago, deliberately trampled on the rights of all nations to be masters of their own destiny, undermined international law and the United Nations Charter, and has now been used again as a weapon to suppress national liberation movements and implement open aggression. The United States, which seeks world hegemony, has once again arbitrarily invaded the territory of other countries and enslaved other nations.

　　The Polish government would like to draw attention to the fact that, as a result of the elections held throughout Korea, the People's Democratic Government of the Korean Republic has been established, representing all the people, and has been recognized by several countries, including the Polish Republic. The Korean people are striving to unite within the framework of a single national entity. Opposing the unification of Korea is the Lee Seung-man puppet government, which represents the interests of the United States; it was that government that repeatedly clamored to invade North Korea.

　　Just as the fascists' provocations in Korea had failed and the development of the situation posed no threat to world peace, the US government, without waiting for the United Nations to consider the issue, carried out military intervention in Korea and announced the invasion of Taiwan. The US government notified the representatives of the countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty and, it is worth noting, Franco's Spain of this decision. In other words, it has taken a barbarous action that violates the United Nations Charter, because it did not notify all UN member states of its decision, but instead notified the representative of Franco's Spain, with whom the United Nations organization cannot have any relations according to the United Nations resolutions that must be implemented.

　　Only after issuing its decision on armed intervention did the United States abuse the authority of the United Nations in an attempt to find legal cover for its aggressive actions, seeking the United Nations organization to endorse its attitude. The Security Council's resolution is intended to serve as this kind of cover. However, everyone knows that the Security Council is not currently exercising its functions, because according to Articles 23 and 27 of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council is composed of eleven members, including five permanent members, and all important decisions require unanimous agreement among the major powers. The resolution notified to the Polish government by the Secretary-General of the United Nations was passed in the absence of the representatives of the Security Council's two permanent members, namely the Soviet Union and China, so it cannot be considered a resolution of the Security Council, but only the opinion of six member states of the United Nations, which no one is obliged to comply with.

　　At the same time, the Polish government most resolutely protests against the US aggression in Korea and against Chinese territory, and protests against the US announcement of intervention in the Philippines and Vietnam.

　　The Polish government would like to draw attention to the fact that the United States' arbitrary decision regarding the occupation of Taiwan infringes upon the territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China, is an unreasonable act of aggression, and is a threat to peace.

　　Based on the above, the Polish government solemnly declares that it cannot consider this kind of "resolution" notified by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

　　The Polish delegation to the United Nations has received instructions to forward the above statement to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and request that it be circulated as an official document to all member states of the United Nations.

　　波兰政府严斥美帝侵略远东
    拒绝考虑安理会非法“决议”
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社华沙一日电：波兰通讯社报道：波兰政府已接到联合国秘书长关于安理会六个理事所通过的与朝鲜局势有关的“决议”的报告。在这件事情以前，美国总统杜鲁门就已下令美国武装力量在远东开始侵略性的军事行动，即干涉台湾、越南和菲律宾，并且直接参加朝鲜的战事。
    由此可见，联合国秘书长向波兰政府提出的报告，只能视为声名狼藉的杜鲁门主义的进一步的实施。三年前宣布的这种主义，故意蹂躏各民族人民做自己的命运的主宰的权利，破坏国际公法和联合国宪章，这一次又再度被利用，作为压抑民族解放运动的武器，实行公开侵略的武器。要求称霸世界的美国，已再度擅自侵犯他国的领土，奴役其他民族。
    波兰政府要唤起注意，由于朝鲜全境举行选举的结果，朝鲜共和国人民民主政府已经建立起来，代表着全体人民，并且已获得包括波兰共和国在内的若干国家的承认。朝鲜人民力求在单一国家的机构内统一起来。反对朝鲜统一的，是李承晚傀儡政府，它代表美国的利益，就是那个政府曾一再扬言要侵入北朝鲜。
    正当法西斯在朝鲜的挑衅已告失败，而局势的发展对世界和平决无威胁的时候，美国政府不等待联合国考虑这个问题，竟在朝鲜实行军事干涉，而且宣布侵略台湾。美国政府把这项决定通知了参加北大西洋公约的各国代表们，并且，也通知了佛朗哥西班牙，这是很值得注意的。换句话说，它已采取了违背联合国宪章的蛮横行动，因为它并不曾把自己的决定通知各联合国会员国，却通知了佛朗哥西班牙的代表，而根据必须执行的联合国的决议，联合国组织是不能够跟佛朗哥西班牙发生任何关系的。
    美国只是在发表了关于武装干涉的决定以后，才滥用联合国的权威，企图替它的侵略行为寻找合法的掩护，要联合国组织来认可它的态度。安理会的决议就是要充当这一种掩护。然而，大家都知道：目前安理会并不在行使职权，因为根据联合国宪章第二十三条和第二十七条，安理会是由包括五个常任理事在内的十一个理事组成的，而且一切重要的决议都要各大国一致协议才行。联合国秘书长通知波兰政府的那个决议，是在安理会的两个常任理事即苏联和中国的代表缺席的时候通过的，所以不能认为是安理会的决议，而仅能认为是联合国六个会员国的意见，任何人都没有照办的义务。
    同时，波兰政府最坚决地抗议美国在朝鲜和向中国领土上的侵略，抗议美国宣布干涉菲律宾和越南。
    波兰政府要唤起注意，美国所作的关于占领台湾一事的蛮横决定，侵犯了中华人民共和国的领土完整，乃是无理的侵略行动，是对和平的一种威胁。
    波兰政府，根据上述，郑重声明：它不能考虑联合国秘书长所通知的这一种“决议”。
    联合国中的波兰代表团，已接到训令，将上述声明转交联合国秘书长，请作为正式文件通告联合国所有各会员国。
