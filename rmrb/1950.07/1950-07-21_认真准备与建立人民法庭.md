　　Seriously Prepare for and Establish People's Tribunals
    The "General Rules for the Organization of People's Tribunals," passed by the 41st Administrative Council meeting of the Central People's Government on June 14th and approved by the Chairman of the Central People's Government, were promulgated and implemented on July 19th. This is a very important document.
    The People's Tribunal is one of the important fighting weapons of the People's Government in consolidating the current revolutionary tasks of the people's democratic dictatorship. Its task is: "To use judicial procedures to punish despots, bandits, secret agents, counter-revolutionaries, and criminals who violate land reform decrees who endanger the interests of the people and the state, plot riots, and disrupt social order, so as to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. In addition, disputes over the classification of class components in land reform and other cases related to land reform shall also be handled by the People's Tribunal." These tasks are in line with the actual needs of the current revolutionary struggle.
    After the complete annihilation of the Kuomintang reactionaries' regular army on the mainland, the remaining bandits, under the instigation of American imperialism, still used various methods to carry out anti-people's secret agent conspiracies, spreading rumors, poisoning, sabotaging, assassinating, robbing grain, creating riots, and, in some newly liberated areas, inciting and coercing some backward masses to organize bandits and launch counter-revolutionary so-called "guerrilla warfare," attempting to disrupt the newly established revolutionary order in this way, in order to undermine the construction work of the People's Government, create hardship for the people's lives, and attempt to provoke the people's dissatisfaction with the People's Government. The People's Government, leading the people, has carried out a resolute struggle against these counter-revolutionary activities organized by the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and has achieved great victories. The key to achieving victory lies in the "policy of combining suppression with leniency" instructed by Chairman Mao, that is, "the ringleaders must be dealt with severely, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." It should be emphasized here that suppression is an indispensable aspect. Without the suppression of the ringleaders, it is not enough to enforce the law strictly, alleviate public anger, warn against emulation, and promote the repentance of coerced elements. Purely one-sided leniency will in fact become connivance at counter-revolutionary elements. In some areas, precisely because the suppression was not done well enough, it resulted in some unnecessary losses and aroused mass dissatisfaction. Some people in some areas say that the People's Government is "boundlessly lenient," which precisely shows this dissatisfaction. However, in order to correctly implement the above policy, in addition to clarifying the understanding of the policy, it is also necessary to solve such a practical difficulty, that is, the area is vast, the situation is complex, and the judicial organs of the new district's regime are still very unsound. If there is no organization that can fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses as a capable assistant to the People's Government in fighting against counter-revolutionary elements, it will be impossible to implement the policy with only a few judicial workers to carry out this work. The People's Tribunal can solve this difficulty. The necessity of the People's Tribunal is an important reason.
    The People's Tribunal is not only a weapon to fight against bandits, secret agents, and counter-revolutionary elements, but also an important weapon to realize land reform from rent reduction against local bullies to land distribution. The role of the People's Tribunal in land reform mainly has two aspects: First, to suppress criminals who resist land reform decrees. Past land reform experience has proved that there are some die-hard elements in the landlord class who despise government decrees and resolutely sabotage land reform. If the reactionary arrogance of this part of the people is not struck down, the righteousness of the peasants cannot be promoted, the internal division of the landlord class cannot be achieved, and the land reform decrees and policies cannot be implemented. Only by severely punishing this part of the people can the peasants' confidence in the struggle be improved, the landlords who obey the government decrees will also feel that the People's Government is clear in rewards and punishments, and those landlords who are temporarily watching will also know what to be wary of and dare not openly resist land reform. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the land reform issue: "Land reform is a systematic and fierce struggle." Ignoring this aspect will inevitably greatly hinder the land reform work. Second, because for many years the peasants have been under the oppression and exploitation of the landlords, suffering endless pain and enduring boundless grievances, once they stand up, they will inevitably demand redress and vent their anger, and even engage in retaliatory behaviors of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." If this emotion of the peasants cannot be well grasped and led, and allowed to develop on its own, it is very likely to develop into indiscriminate beatings and killings, causing chaos in social order. This is very unfavorable to the peasants. The People's Tribunal is a systematic and orderly organ to suppress illegal landlords. With such an organ, it can avoid the spontaneous retaliatory behaviors of the peasants and enable the land reform to maintain normal order. Therefore, in order to effectively suppress the stubborn and resistant evil landlords and at the same time prevent the narrow retaliatory tendencies of the peasants, it is very necessary to establish People's Tribunals in land reform.
    The People's Tribunal is a mass-based judicial institution, and it should always maintain particularly close ties with the masses. When the People's Tribunal accepts cases, it should conduct full investigations and studies among the masses and widely solicit the opinions of the masses on the handling of this case. When carrying out these tasks, the People's Tribunal should closely cooperate with the People's Congress and people's organizations, mainly the peasant representative congress or peasant representative conference and peasant associations in rural areas. During the trial, the masses who are present may also speak with permission. However, it should be noted that the People's Tribunal should not be turned into a disguised mass struggle meeting. The People's Tribunal must maintain strict order and must conduct trials in accordance with normal judicial procedures. The defendant should also be guaranteed the full right to defend and ask someone to defend. Torture is absolutely prohibited in the People's Tribunal. Since most of the staff of many People's Tribunals still lack experience in judicial work, special attention should be paid to learning in this area. At the same time, also because the broad masses of the people have a high degree of hatred for despots, bandits, secret agents, counter-revolutionary elements, and criminals who violate land reform decrees, the staff of the People's Tribunal, if they do not pay special attention, can easily bring this emotion into the trial and ignore the necessary judicial procedures in the People's Tribunal. Therefore, all comrades engaged in the work of the People's Tribunal, on the one hand, should have a clear and correct stand, and on the other hand, must always remain very calm, and must never be emotional and disrupt the judicial order of the People's Tribunal.
    The People's Tribunal and the People's Court cannot be confused. The nature of the People's Tribunal is "a special court other than the civil and criminal courts of the People's Court." Not all cases should be sent to the People's Tribunal for handling. Ordinary civil and criminal cases should still be handled by the civil and criminal courts of the People's Court. Complicated cases encountered in the anti-bandit and anti-special struggle should not be sent directly to the People's Tribunal, but should be handled by the state inspection organs and the People's Public Security and judicial organs.
    Finally, it must be pointed out that, generally speaking, various localities still lack experience in this important work of the People's Tribunal. Therefore, various localities must summarize experience at any time in their work and gradually raise the work of the People's Tribunal to the due level.

### 认真准备与建立人民法庭

　　认真准备与建立人民法庭
    中央人民政府政务院于六月十四日第四十一次政务会议所通过的人民法庭组织通则业经中央人民政府主席批准，于七月十九日公布施行。这是一个很重要的文件。
    人民法庭是人民政府在巩固当前人民民主专政的革命任务中重要的斗争武器之一。它的任务是：“运用司法程序，惩治危害人民与国家利益、阴谋暴乱、破坏社会治安的恶霸、土匪、特务、反革命分子及违抗土地改革法令的罪犯，巩固人民民主专政。此外，关于土地改革中划分阶级成份的争执及其他有关土地改革的案件，亦均由人民法庭受理之。”这些任务的规定，是符合于当前革命斗争的实际需要的。
    国民党反动派的正规军在大陆上全部覆灭之后，残余匪帮在美国帝国主义的策动下，依然用各种办法进行反人民的特务阴谋活动，造谣、放毒、破坏、暗杀、抢粮、骚乱、并在某些新解放区煽惑与胁迫一部分落后群众，组织土匪，发动反革命的所谓“游击战争”，企图用这种办法来扰乱刚刚建立不久的革命秩序，以破坏人民政府的建设工作，制造人民生活的困苦，并企图挑起人民对人民政府的不满。对于国民党反动派残余所组织的这些反革命活动，人民政府领导人民进行了坚决的斗争，并已取得了伟大的胜利。取得胜利的关键，在于毛主席所指示的“镇压与宽大相结合的政策”，即“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策。在这里应该着重指出的是：镇压是绝不可缺少的一个方面，没有对首恶的镇压，就不足以严明法纪，平泄民愤，警戒效尤，促进胁从分子的悔悟。单纯片面的宽大，实际上会成为对反革命分子的纵容。某些地区正因为在镇压方面作得不够，结果造成一些不应有的损失，并引起群众不满。有些地区的人民说人民政府是“宽大无边”，这正表明了这种不满情绪。但是为了正确的执行上述政策，除了对政策的认识须要弄清楚以外，还必须解决这样一个实际困难，即地区广阔，情况复杂，新区的政权司法机构还很不健全，如果没有一种能够充分发挥群众革命积极性的组织，作为人民政府对反革命分子进行斗争的得力助手，单凭少数司法工作人员来进行此项工作，政策是无法实现的。人民法庭正可以解决这种困难。人民法庭之所以必要，这正是一个重要的理由。
    人民法庭不只是与土匪、特务、反革命分子进行斗争的武器，而且也是实现从反霸减租到分配土地的土地改革的重要武器。人民法庭在土地改革中的作用，主要有两方面：第一、是镇压反抗土地改革法令的犯罪分子。过去土地改革的经验证明，在地主阶级中有一部分死硬分子，他们藐视政府法令，坚决破坏土地改革。如果不把这一部分人的反动气焰打下去，农民的正气就不能伸张，地主阶级的内部就不能分化，土地改革的法令政策就无法实施。只有对这一部分人加以严厉惩办，农民的斗争信心才会提高，服从政府法令的地主也才会感到人民政府赏罚严明，并使那些暂时观望的地主也知所警戒，不敢公然反抗土地改革。刘少奇副主席在关于土地改革问题的报告中指出：“土地改革是一场系统的激烈的斗争”，忽略了这一方面，必将使土地改革工作受到很大的阻碍。第二、由于多少年来农民一直是处在地主的压迫、剥削之下，遭受了无穷的痛苦，隐忍了无边的怨气，一旦翻身起来，必然会要求伸冤出气，以至发生“以眼还眼、以牙还牙”的报复行为。对于农民这种情绪如果不能很好掌握与领导，任其自流发展，就很可能发展到乱打乱杀，造成社会秩序的混乱。这对农民是很不利的。人民法庭是一个有系统有秩序的镇压不法地主的机关，有了这样一种机关就可以避免农民自发的报复行为，使土地改革得以保持正常的秩序。因此，为了有效地镇压顽抗土地改革的恶霸地主，而同时又要防止农民的狭隘的报复主义的偏向，在土地改革中设立人民法庭是十分必要的。
    人民法庭是一种带群众性的司法机构，它应该时刻与群众保持特别紧密的联系。人民法庭在受理案件时，应该在群众中进行充分的调查研究，广泛征求群众对处理这一案件的意见。人民法庭在进行这些工作时，应该与人民代表会议和人民团体，在农村中主要是农民代表大会或农民代表会议和农民协会取得密切的配合。在进行审判时，旁听的群众，经允许后，亦可以发言。但是，应该注意，不要把人民法庭变成变相的群众斗争大会，人民法庭必须保持严格的秩序，而且必须按照正常的司法程序来进行审判。也应保障被告有辩护及请人辩护的充分权利。人民法庭中绝对禁止刑讯。由于许多人民法庭的多数工作人员还缺乏司法工作的经验，对这一方面应该特别注意学习。同时，也由于广大人民群众对恶霸、土匪、特务、反革命分子与违抗土地改革法令的犯罪分子有着高度的仇恨，人民法庭的工作人员，如果不特别注意，就很容易把这种感情带到审判中去，而忽视人民法庭中必要的司法程序。故一切从事人民法庭工作的同志，一方面应有鲜明的正确的立场，另一方面也必须时刻保持十分冷静，绝不可以感情用事，自乱人民法庭的司法秩序。
    人民法庭与人民法院不能混同，人民法庭的性质，是“人民法院的民事庭、刑事庭以外的特别法庭”，不应该把一切案件都送到人民法庭去处理，普通的民事、刑事案件仍然应由人民法院的民事庭、刑事庭受理。在反匪反特斗争中所遇到的情节复杂的案件，亦不应直接送人民法庭，而应由国家检查机关与人民公安司法机关负责处理。
    最后，必须指出：各地对于人民法庭这一项重要的工作，一般说，还是缺乏经验的。因此，各地在工作中必须随时总结经验，把人民法庭工作逐步提高到应有的水平。
