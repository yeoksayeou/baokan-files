    As we, all the telecom workers in the Beijing area, happily celebrate the birthday of our own working class party – the Communist Party of China – we would like to report to you on a few matters. Since we launched a work competition in April this year, we have achieved considerable results in these three months. In terms of the Telegraph Office: the number of outgoing errors in March was 104, and now it has been reduced to 56 per month. The error percentage has dropped from 0.087% to 0.047%, a reduction of 46.1%. The original plan was to reduce it by 30% through competition, but the actual reduction exceeded the original plan by more than 50%. The errors in various business offices in March were 150, which has now been reduced to 32. Major outgoing errors in May decreased by 59% compared with April, and the error percentage decreased from 0.131% to 0.0067%. Before the competition was launched, the line maintenance team had 994 households out of service when it rained on April 17th. As a result of the workers' efforts to repair them, only 258 households were out of service when it rained on July 5th. In addition, the comrades in the engineering team also achieved the result of completing 47 days of work in 36 days. In the competition, 21 model workers such as Li Duan emerged, and 4 people such as Chen Shilin made special achievements. It is especially worth reporting to you that Comrade Hou Deyuan designed the "88" type line crossover, which can save more than 947,300 catties of millet in 1950, and crosstalk has also been reduced. Comrade Wang Decheng improved the T-type crossover to the T1-type crossover, which can save more than 871,200 catties of millet this year, and the efficiency has also been improved. In addition, Comrades Zhang Honglun and Guo Manyi designed the impedance direct-reading tester, and worker Yuan Shikun trial-produced carbon powder substitutes, which have been put into application. These are all worth reporting to you. We will use these achievements to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. We deeply know that only under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China can we achieve such achievements.
    Today we are holding a celebration and commendation meeting. All the workers are willing to guarantee to you that in the future, under your wise leadership, we will work hard to develop the telecommunications industry and improve communication efficiency so that the telecommunications industry can better serve the people. We wish you good health!
