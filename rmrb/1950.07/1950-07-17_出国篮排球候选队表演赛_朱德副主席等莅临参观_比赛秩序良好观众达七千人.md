　　National Basketball and Volleyball Candidate Team Exhibition Match

    Vice Chairman Zhu De and Others Attend

    Well-Ordered Match Attracts 7,000 Spectators

    [Our Paper] The second day of the exhibition matches of the basketball and volleyball candidate teams participating in the World Student Games was held yesterday at the Labor People's Cultural Palace stadium. Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier Dong Biwu, Minister Bo Yibo, and Mayor Nie Rongzhen attended and observed. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, were on-site to provide guidance. The audience reached over seven thousand people, truly a new high for sports matches recently.

    Yesterday's exhibition matches included two volleyball games: Tianjin vs. Shanghai, two to one, Tianjin won; Beijing vs. Guangzhou, two to zero, Beijing won. And one basketball game: Beijing vs. Shanghai, forty-seven to forty-two, Beijing won. Because some players on the Shanghai basketball team were ill, yesterday's game temporarily invited two players from Tianjin to assist.

    The matches lasted from 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Under the blazing sun, the emotions of the more than seven thousand spectators remained tense and enthusiastic, and the order was also very good. Among the players' performances, the basketball game was the most exciting. Shanghai and Beijing engaged in close combat, and the fighting was intense. There were often clever passes and skillful shots, earning much applause.

    【本报讯】参加世界学生运动会篮、排球候选队表演赛昨为第二天，仍在劳动人民文化宫运动场举行。朱德副主席、董必武副总理、薄一波部长、聂荣臻市长均莅临参观。青年团中央书记冯文彬、全国青联主席廖承志均在场指导。观众达七千余人，实为近来球类赛的新高潮。
    昨天表演赛计排球两场：天津对上海，二比一，天津胜；北京对广州，二比○，北京胜。篮球一场：北京对上海，四十七比四十二，北京胜。上海篮球队因有队员负病，昨天比赛，临时邀天津二人助阵。
    比赛自三时半至六时完毕，在烈日下七千余观众情绪始终紧张、热烈，秩序也很好。队员们的表演，以篮球赛最精彩，上海、北京短兵相接、厮杀白热，时有妙传巧投，博得采声不少。
