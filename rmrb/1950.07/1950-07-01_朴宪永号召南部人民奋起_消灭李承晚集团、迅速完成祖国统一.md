Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th—Park Heon-yeong, Vice-Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and member of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea, delivered a radio address at 9:30 PM on the 28th, calling on members of the South Korean Workers' Party to unite all the people and rise up together under the leadership of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to rapidly complete the great cause of national reunification. Park Heon-yeong began by saying: The heroic Korean People's Army, in order to defend the motherland and the people, resolutely counterattacked the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's adventurous offensive and quickly turned to the counter-offensive. In the few days since the People's Army began its counter-offensive, it has captured many important cities in quick succession with the force of a raging tide, and on the 28th liberated the capital of the Republic—Seoul. At the same time, the guerrilla forces in the southern half, echoing the People's Army, have also liberated many towns.

Park Heon-yeong said: The liberation of the capital has virtually decided the outcome of the war. The complete elimination of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang and the complete liberation of the southern half are only a matter of time.

Park Heon-yeong continued: The history of the southern half over the past five years is a history of the patriotic people fighting against the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, who attempted to sell out the motherland to imperialism, for the reunification and independence of the motherland. It is a bloody record, a record of national honor and glory. Now, for the fighting patriotic people, a great turning point towards final victory has arrived, a time to summarize all the heroic struggles that our brothers and sisters in the southern half have waged under the brutal persecution of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang for the past five years. The time has come for the people of the southern half to become masters of the country. The Korean People's Army, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, equipped with noble patriotism and the latest modern weapons, is waging a just war to liberate the people of the southern half from the violence of the traitors. The war aims of the People's Army are very clear and upright. They will never lay down their guns until all reactionary forces are eliminated and all the people of the country are completely liberated.

Park Heon-yeong then awakened the people of South Korea to remember firmly the epic of their martyrs who had bravely sacrificed themselves for the motherland and the people. He said: You must deeply remember the names of our country's most outstanding sons and daughters, led by comrades Kim Sam-ryong and Lee Ju-ha, and many heroic guerrilla leaders. You must deeply remember the tragic scenes of countless beautiful villages being burned down and tens of thousands of innocent people being massacred in the vast guerrilla areas. You must also deeply remember the unprecedented atrocities of the Syngman Rhee beasts, the blood of 30,000 innocent people on Jeju Island, and the destruction of more than half of the houses on the entire island. He said: The heroic People's Army is marching south precisely to avenge these deep-seated blood feuds, to inherit the legacy of the martyrs, and to quickly end the fratricidal civil war provoked by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. Therefore, you—the people of all cities, villages, fishing villages, factories, and mines in the southern half—should rise up together and actively participate in this righteous war of national salvation. The stronger the fighting unity of all patriotic people, the shorter the time to eliminate the bandits and end the civil war. The sacrifices and misfortunes of the people can also be reduced.

Park Heon-yeong called on all members of the South Korean Workers' Party to stand at the forefront of the people, unite all the people, and carry out various struggles to disrupt the enemy's rear, instigate uprisings in urban and rural areas, and destroy all enemy transportation to prevent the United States from supplying arms to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang; to publicize and explain the heroic deeds and war aims of the People's Army to the people, to organize the broad masses of the people to support the People's Army, to quickly restore the People's Committees in the newly liberated areas, and to begin various reconstruction works.

Park Heon-yeong called on the brave guerrillas to transform guerrilla warfare into offensive warfare, to wipe out the remaining enemies in the rear, to expand the liberated areas, to expand their own ranks, to attack enemy headquarters and command posts, to destroy enemy transportation, to seize enemy warehouses and clothing factories, to arrest and punish pro-Japanese traitors, and to mobilize the masses to support the People's Army; workers should organize strikes to completely paralyze production and transportation, prevent the enemy from sabotage during their retreat, and protect factories, mines, railways, and institutions; peasants should not give the enemy a single grain of food, organize uprisings, and cooperate with the guerrillas to support the People's Army; national entrepreneurs and handicraftsmen should resist all taxes to the puppet government and actively support the People's Army in defending national industry and commerce; intellectuals and staff members should actively oppose the enemy and support the People's Army; officers and soldiers of the puppet "National Defense Army" should turn their guns around and stand on the side of the People's Army and the guerrillas.

Park Heon-yeong finally said: We must never allow the civil war launched by the bandits to continue. All the people of the southern half should rise up together, closely unite around the government of the Republic, and under the banner of the Republic, complete the great cause of national reunification.

　　朴宪永号召南部人民奋起
    消灭李承晚集团、迅速完成祖国统一
    【新华社平壤三十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议副主席、劳动党中央政治局委员朴宪永于二十八日晚九时半发表广播演说，号召南朝鲜劳动党党员团结全体人民，一致奋起，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的领导下，迅速完成祖国统一的伟业。朴宪永首先说道：英勇的朝鲜人民军为了保卫祖国和人民，毅然对李承晚匪帮的冒险进攻予以回击，而迅速转入了反攻。人民军开始反攻后几天之中，即以怒涛之势相继攻占了许多重要城市，并于二十八日解放了共和国首都——汉城。同时与人民军相呼应的南半部游击队，也解放了许多城镇。
    朴宪永说：首都的解放已从事实上决定了战争的胜负。李承晚匪帮的全部消灭，与南半部的完全解放，仅是时间问题了。
    朴宪永继称：过去五年中南半部的历史，是反对企图将祖国出卖给帝国主义的李承晚匪帮的爱国人民为祖国统一、独立而斗争的历史，是血的记载，是民族的荣誉和光辉的记载。现在在战斗的爱国人民面前，已经到了争取最后胜利的巨大的转变时期，到了五年以来南半部兄弟姊妹们在李承晚匪帮残暴的迫害下所进行的一切英勇斗争的总结时期。南半部人民成为国家主人的时期已经到来了。由祖国人民的优秀儿女所组成、以高尚的爱国主义和现代最新武器装备起来的朝鲜人民军，为了把南半部人民从卖国贼的暴力下解放出来，正进行着正义的战争。人民军的战争目的是非常光明正大的。他们在未消灭一切反动势力与未彻底解放全国人民以前，是决不放下枪杆的。
    朴宪永继唤起南朝鲜人民要牢牢记住他们的先烈曾为祖国和人民而前仆后继、英勇牺牲的史诗。他说：我们祖国最优秀的儿女以金参龙、李舟河同志为首的许多英勇的游击队指导者的名字，你们必须深刻记忆。广大的游击区内无数优美的村庄被烧毁，成千成万无辜的人民被杀戮的悲惨情景，你们应深刻记忆。济州岛上三万无辜人民的鲜血，和全岛一半以上的房屋变成废墟的李承晚野兽们旷古未闻的暴行，你们也应深刻记住。他说：英勇的人民军正是在为你们报这些血海深仇，继承先烈的遗志，并为迅速终止李承晚匪帮所挑起的同族相争的内战，才向南进军的。因此，你们——南半部的一切城市、农村、渔村、工厂与矿山的人民，应一致奋起，积极参加这一救国的正义战争。全体爱国人民的战斗的团结力量越强大，消灭匪徒们和结束内战的时间就越能缩短。人民的牺牲与不幸也就能减少。
    朴宪永号召南朝鲜全体党员，站在人民前头，团结全体人民，进行各种扰乱敌人后方的斗争，鼓动城乡人民起义，破坏敌人的一切交通运输，以阻止美国军火供给李承晚匪帮；向人民宣传解释人民军的英勇事迹和战争目的，组织广大人民支援人民军，在新解放区迅速恢复人民委员会，着手各种重建工作。
    朴宪永号召勇敢的游击队应将游击战转变为进攻战，扫荡后方的残敌，扩大解放区，扩大自己的队伍，袭击敌军参谋部和指挥部，破坏敌人的运输，夺取敌人的仓库和被服厂，逮捕并惩办亲日派卖国贼，发动群众支援人民军；工人应组织罢工，使生产交通完全陷于瘫痪状态，防止敌人败走时的破坏，保护工厂、矿山、铁路与机关；农民不要给敌人一粒粮食，组织起义，配合游击队支援人民军；民族企业家、手工业者要向伪政府抗缴一切赋税，积极支援为保卫民族工商业而斗争的人民军；知识分子与职员都应积极反对敌人，支援人民军；伪“国防军”官兵要掉转枪口站到人民军和游击队方面来。
    朴宪永最后说道：我们绝不能使匪徒们所发动的内战继续延长下去。南半部全体人民应一致奋起，紧紧地团结在共和国政府的周围，在共和国的旗帜下完成祖国统一的伟业。
