Rectification Work Dynamics in Various Locations:

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Northeast Bureau, in order to concretely guide each directly subordinate unit to arrange Party rectification work, held a forum for the responsible comrades of each directly subordinate unit from June 26th to 28th, for three to four hours each day. The responsible persons of the Northeast Bureau's various departments, commissions, and the party organizations of the Northeast People's Government's various ministries, committees, and banks participated in the forum. The forum was personally presided over by Comrades Gao Gang and Li Fuchun. The method of the forum was that each unit's responsible comrades, based on the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast Bureau's instructions on Party rectification, and in connection with the actual situation of their own unit and system, would separately propose concrete plans for how to combine the current work with Party rectification. After each unit finished its report, the participating comrades would offer opinions, and then Comrades Gao Gang and Li Fuchun, in light of the actual situation of the unit and the existing problems, would give clear instructions from the aspects of ideology, policy, and concrete methods of rectification. For example, after listening to the report on the rectification plan of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Comrade Gao Gang emphasized that there were quite serious problems in the current work of the agricultural and forestry departments, such as flood prevention and pest control, and the promotion of improved farm implements, and that the existing bureaucracy, generalism, and careless work style should be examined and overcome from the actual work. Regarding the rectification work of the Ministry of Trade, Comrade Gao Gang instructed that the idea of economic accounting should be emphasized, so as to strengthen the overall planning and policy of trade work, and overcome the many serious problems that currently exist. After the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions reviewed its past failure to implement the policy of uniting the entire working class, especially uniting technical personnel and staff, and strengthening workers' labor discipline, and its insufficient overall concept and concept of serving the workers, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out: This review is realistic and practical. The key to whether the rectification work is carried out well lies in the leadership. If the leadership of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions can get their thinking straight, it will be easier for the cadres below to get their thinking straight. This forum made the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast Bureau concrete by combining them with the actual situation of each department.

    东北局直属单位负责人座谈具体指导整风工作
    【本报讯】东北局为具体指导各直属单位布置整党工作，从六月二十六日到二十八日，每天以三、四小时时间，举行了直属各单位主要负责同志的座谈会。参加座谈会的有东北局各部委及东北人民政府各部、会、行党组织的负责人。座谈会由高岗同志与李富春同志亲自主持。座谈方法，先由各单位负责同志，根据中共中央及东北局的整党指示，联系本单位和本系统的实际情况，分别提出如何结合当前工作进行整风的具体计划。每一单位报告完毕后，则由到会同志提出意见，而后由高岗同志与李富春同志，针对该单位实际情况及所存在的问题，从思想上、政策上以及整风的具体方法上，给予明确指示。比如，听了农林部的整风计划报告后，高岗同志着重指出：农林部门当前的工作中如防洪治虫推广改良农具等，都有相当严重的问题，应该从实际工作来检查与克服现在存在的官僚主义，一般化和粗枝大叶作风。对贸易部的整风工作，高岗同志指示，应着重贯彻经济核算思想，从而加强贸易工作的全面计划性政策性，克服目前存在的许多严重问题。东北总工会检讨了过去对贯彻团结整个工人阶级，尤其是对团结技术人员与职员，对加强工人劳动纪律的政策，未能贯彻，整体观念和为工人服务观念不足的检讨后，高岗同志指出：这种检讨是实事求是的。整风工作进行好坏，关键在于领导，东总领导思想打通了，下面干部思想就容易打通了。这一座谈会使中共中央和东北局的指示，结合各部门实际情况而具体化起来。
