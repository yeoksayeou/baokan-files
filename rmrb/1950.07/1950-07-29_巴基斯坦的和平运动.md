    Pakistan's Peace Movement

    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th] TASS dispatch from Moscow: The "Izvestia" newspaper published on the 26th an article by Vasilyev commenting on the peace movement in Pakistan, pointing out that after the conclusion of the First National Peace Congress of Pakistan held this spring, many workers, farmers, students, teachers, newspaper editors, doctors, lawyers, writers and journalists in Pakistan participated in the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal. Many trade unions and tens of thousands of members of student and women's groups went to shops and markets to explain the purpose of this movement to the people. They made speeches at rallies in workers' residential areas and collected signatures in the streets.
    Railway workers living in the filthy workers' district of "Basti" warmly welcomed the collectors of peace signatures, who are known in Pakistan as "peace volunteers." In the eyes of these railway workers, fighting for peace means fighting for bread, for housing and for life itself. When "peace volunteers" were working among the police, one policeman not only signed the Peace Appeal himself, but also took several blank signature books and obtained the signatures of his comrades. He also wrote his address on the signature book: Lahore Fort, one of the most terrible prisons in Lahore.
    In Karachi, signatories to the Peace Appeal included prominent political leaders, scientists, the editors of Karachi's two major newspapers, the "Imroze" and "Anjam", progressive writers and peasant leaders. In Lahore, the mother of the Prime Minister of Pakistan and several members of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly also signed.
    Vasilyev wrote in conclusion: The peace movement in Pakistan is expanding and strengthening. The people of Pakistan, like all the people of the world, do not need war.

　　巴基斯坦的和平运动
    瓦西利耶夫
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《消息报》于二十六日刊载瓦西利耶夫评述巴基斯坦和平运动的一文指出：今年春季举行的巴基斯坦第一届全国和平大会结束以后，巴基斯坦的许多工人、农民、学生、教师、报纸编辑、医生、律师、作家与新闻记者，都参加了为斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集签名的运动。许多工会以及学生、妇女团体的成千成万会员曾到店铺和商场中去，向人民说明这个运动的目的。他们在工人住区的集会中发表演说，并在大街上征集签名。
    住在“巴士提”的龌龊的工人区中的铁路工人们，热烈欢迎和平签名的征集者，这些征集者在巴基斯坦被称为“和平志愿兵”。在这些铁路工人们看来，为和平而斗争，就是为面包、为房屋和生活本身而斗争。当“和平志愿兵”在警察中进行工作的时候，有一个警察不但自己在和平宣言上签了名，而且取去几张空白的签名书，征得了他的同志们的签名。他并在签名书上写下了他的通讯处：拉合尔炮台，这是拉合尔的一个最可怕的监狱。
    在喀喇蚩，在和平宣言上签名的有著名的政治领袖、科学家、喀喇蚩两大报纸《伊姆罗兹报》和《安雅姆报》的编辑、进步作家和农民领袖。在拉合尔，巴基斯坦总理的母亲和巴基斯坦制宪议会的几位议员也都签了名。
    瓦西利耶夫在结语中写道：巴基斯坦的和平运动正在扩大增强。巴基斯坦的人民，和全世界所有的人民一样，都不需要战争。
