Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the morning of the 19th that the People's Army units are continuing their offensive on all fronts, heavily striking the enemy. On the 17th, the People's Army annihilated the enemy near Buyeo County, more than 40 kilometers west of Daejeon, liberated Buyeo County, and continued south along the Geum River, capturing Nonsan County, 40 kilometers southwest of Daejeon, in one fell swoop. At the same time, guerrilla units in Gyeongsangnam-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do provinces are responding to the People's Army's victorious offensive and are launching vigorous activities.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS, New York, 18th: A communiqué issued by MacArthur's headquarters on the morning of the 17th admitted that U.S. forces in front of Daejeon had retreated, but the communiqué attempted to conceal this defeat by claiming that units of the U.S. 24th Division only retreated "about six miles" in the Daejeon area.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to Associated Press, Tokyo: In order to cover up the disastrous defeat of the American invaders in Korea, the U.S. military authorities in Tokyo once issued an order on the 15th prohibiting Associated Press reporter Lambert and United Press reporter Kallischer, who had partially revealed the ugly state of the U.S. military's rout, from going to the Korean front line for interviews.

An official of the MacArthur Headquarters press office, Eckles, admitted that "there was nothing untrue about the news released" by the two reporters mentioned above. Eckles revealed that the real intention of prohibiting Lambert and Kallischer from going to the Korean front line for interviews was a threat, aimed at "reducing foreign reporters' coverage of the U.S. military's defeats."

According to another United Press report, MacArthur rescinded the order on the 16th because he "believed in their (referring to Lambert and Kallischer) judgment" and "both were old friends of MacArthur."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to TASS, Pyongyang: Korean newspapers published on the 17th the names of the first group of twelve heroes who fought for the freedom, independence, and unification of the motherland. Among them were the heroic naval officers and soldiers who bravely fought three U.S. heavy warships with four torpedo boats near Jumunjin on the east coast of Korea on July 5th, sinking an enemy cruiser. Torpedo boat squadron leader Kim Kun-ok and boat captain Li Wan-gen were awarded the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the First Class National Flag Medal, and other heroic sailors were also awarded medals and decorations. The twelve decorated heroes also included air force, tank, artillery, and infantry heroes.

　　朝鲜人民军解放扶余论山
    麦克阿瑟总部承认大田地区美军溃退
    金君钰等海陆空军英雄获得勋章
    【新华社平壤十九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十九日晨发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线上继续进攻，沉重地打击敌人。十七日，人民军在大田正西四十余公里的扶余县附近，扫荡敌人，解放了扶余县城，并继续沿锦江南下，一举攻克了大田西南四十公里的论山县。与此同时，庆尚南、北道的游击队，响应人民军的胜利进攻，正展开猛烈活动。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：麦克阿瑟总部十七日晨发表的公报承认在大田前面的美军已经撤退，但该公报企图掩饰这个失败，硬说美国第二十四师的部队仅在大田地区撤退“约六英里”。
    【新华社十九日讯】据美联社东京讯：东京美军当局为了掩饰美国侵略者在朝鲜的惨败，于十五日一度下令禁止曾部分透露美军狼狈溃败丑态的美联社记者兰伯特和合众社记者卡里歇尔再赴朝鲜前线采访。
    麦克阿瑟总部新闻处官员依可尔斯承认：上述两记者所发的消息，“并无与事实不符的事情”。依可尔斯道出禁止兰伯特和卡里歇尔赴朝鲜前线采访的真正意图是一种威胁，是要“使外国记者少报道美军失败的消息”。
    另据合众社消息：麦克阿瑟已于十六日撤销了这项命令，原因是他“相信他们（指兰、卡二人）的判断力”，而且“两人都是麦帅的老友”。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜各报十七日刊载了第一批为祖国的自由、独立与统一而奋斗的十二名英雄的名字。其中包括七月五日在朝鲜东海岸注文津附近以四艘鱼雷艇对美国三艘重级军舰英勇作战而击沉敌人一艘巡洋舰的英雄海军官兵们。鱼雷艇队队长金君钰和艇长李完根获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄的金星章和一级国旗勋章，其他英雄水兵们也分别获得了勋章和奖章。十二个受勋的英雄中，也包括空军、坦克兵、炮兵及步兵英雄们。
