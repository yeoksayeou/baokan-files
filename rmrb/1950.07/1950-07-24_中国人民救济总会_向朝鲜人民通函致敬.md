　　China Relief Association
    Sends Letter of Respect to the Korean People
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch] The China Relief Association has sent a letter of respect to the Korean people. The original letter is as follows: Dear Korean people:
    Since the American imperialists and their lackey Syngman Rhee launched a war against the Korean people, you have demonstrated unparalleled bravery in the liberation war against aggression and for the independence and unification of your country. The troops of the American-Rhee bandit gang have been badly defeated in the face of your strong People's Army. You are also persistently carrying out the work of healing wounds in the difficult environment, on the ruins of the enemy's bestial bombings. We cheer for your victory and pay our highest respects to you. We Chinese people, relying on our own strength, have defeated Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and the Kuomintang bandit gang, and have overcome the disasters they left behind. Therefore, we also believe that the Korean people will surely be able to eliminate the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and overcome the disasters they have created. The Chinese people and all peace-loving, democratic, and freedom-loving people in the world stand on your side and are enthusiastically supporting you. Victory belongs to you.

    向朝鲜人民通函致敬
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民救济总会顷向朝鲜人民通函致敬。原函如下：亲爱的朝鲜人民：
    自美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚向朝鲜人民发动战争以来，你们在反对侵略，争取祖国独立与统一的解放战争中表现出无比的英勇。美李匪帮的军队在你们坚强的人民军面前已遭到惨败。你们并在坚苦的环境里，在敌人兽性轰炸的废墟上，坚忍不屈地在进行恢复创伤的工作。我们为你们的胜利而欢呼，并向你们致崇高的敬意。我们中国人民依靠自己的力量，已经击败了日本帝国主义、美国帝国主义和国民党匪帮，并战胜了他们遗留下来的灾难。因此，我们同样相信，朝鲜人民也必能消灭美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮，并克服他们所制造的灾难。中国人民和全世界爱好和平、民主、自由的人民都站在你们这一边，都在热诚地声援着你们。胜利是属于你们的。
