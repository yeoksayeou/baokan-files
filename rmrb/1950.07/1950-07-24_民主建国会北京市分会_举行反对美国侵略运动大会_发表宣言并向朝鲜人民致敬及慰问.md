The Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association
Holds Rally Against U.S. Aggression Towards Taiwan and Korea
Issues Declaration and Extends Respects and Condolences to the Korean People

[This newspaper reports] The Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association held a rally against U.S. aggression towards Taiwan and Korea at 7 p.m. on the 22nd. Over a thousand members and associates attended. Guo Moruo was invited to give a speech. Guo Moruo said: "U.S. imperialism holds gold dollars in one hand and atomic bombs in the other, thinking it can enslave the people of the world. In fact, it is already a paper tiger covered in wounds and bruises, and it cannot scare anyone at all. It is now going crazy and has already been given a head-on blow by the Korean people. If it does not wake up, we will give it another blow when we liberate Taiwan." Subsequently, members Yu Zhong, Liu Yifeng, Jin Changyou, and others spoke, their emotions extremely high. They passed a declaration and a letter of condolence to the Korean people.

The declaration called on the people of the whole country, especially national industrialists and business people, to enthusiastically respond to the peace signature campaign and strive to develop production, and struggle to be fully prepared economically for the liberation of Taiwan! The declaration, after denouncing the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Korea and their manipulation of the Security Council to pass illegal resolutions, pointed out: Although the American imperialists are frantically attacking the Chinese people, the Korean people, and all Asian people, the iron current of national liberation of the Asian people is surging and the sparks of revolutionary struggle are erupting. It will surely submerge the decadent rule of the dying imperialists, destroy the shackles imposed on them by the imperialists, and achieve final victory!

The letter of respect and condolence to the Korean people stated: "At this moment when the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee gang, have unscrupulously and openly launched a war of aggression, and you have met them with head-on blows, winning victory after victory, and are about to completely liberate South Korea, we first extend our highest respect and warmest congratulations to the great General Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean People's Army, and the revolutionary Korean people! We are convinced that due to the consolidation and expansion of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the aggressive forces of the imperialists can certainly be suppressed; the great achievements of the Korean people's unwavering heroic struggle have further enhanced and encouraged the confidence and courage of the Asian people and even the oppressed people of the whole world to strive for liberation, and will promote the early demise of the imperialists!

Based on the deep friendship between the people of China and Korea, we have already achieved unprecedented victory in the long-term common struggle against Japanese aggression; today, as the Korean people resist American imperialist aggression and the Chinese people resolutely demand the liberation of Taiwan, we should give you more righteous support, and liberate Taiwan as quickly as possible, to respond to you with practical actions!"

　　民主建国会北京市分会
    举行反对美国侵略运动大会 
    发表宣言并向朝鲜人民致敬及慰问
    【本报讯】民主建国会北京市分会二十二日下午七时举行反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动大会，到会员会友千余人，敦请郭沫若讲演。郭沫若说：美帝国主义一手拿着金元，一手拿着原子弹，以为可以奴役世界人民，其实它已是遍体鳞伤的纸老虎了，丝毫吓不倒人。它现在发疯，已经被朝鲜人民给它当头一棒，如果还不清醒，我们解放台湾，还要再给它一棒。继有会员于忠、刘一峰、金长佑等发言，情绪极为高涨，并通过宣言及向朝鲜人民慰问信。
    宣言号召全国人民，尤其是民族工商业者，热烈响应和平签名运动，并努力发展生产，为完成解放台湾经济上的充分准备而奋斗！宣言在痛斥美帝侵略朝鲜和操纵安理会通过非法决议后指出：尽管美国帝国主义者疯狂地进攻中国人民、朝鲜人民和所有亚洲人民，但，亚洲人民民族解放的铁流汹涌澎湃，革命斗争的火花怒发，他必将淹没那行将灭亡的帝国主义者的腐朽统治，毁灭掉帝国主义者所加于他们的镣铐，而获得最后的胜利！
    向朝鲜人民致敬及慰问信称：当此美国帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮肆无忌惮地公然发动侵略战争，业经你们予以迎头痛击，节节胜利、行将全部解放南朝鲜的时候，我们首先向伟大的金日成将军、英勇的朝鲜人民军和革命的朝鲜人民致最崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺！我们确信：由于以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵容的巩固与扩大，一定可以把帝国主义者的侵略势力压制下去；由于朝鲜人民矢志不渝的英勇斗争的伟大成就，更加增强了与鼓舞了亚洲人民以至全世界被压迫人民争求解放的信心和勇气，促使帝国主义者早日灭亡！
    我们基于中朝两国人民的深厚友谊，在长期的共同抗日斗争中，已经取得了空前的胜利；在朝鲜人民反抗美帝侵略与中国人民坚决地要求解放台湾的今天，我们更应给予你们正义的支援，并且尽可能加速的解放台湾，以实际的行动来响应你们！
