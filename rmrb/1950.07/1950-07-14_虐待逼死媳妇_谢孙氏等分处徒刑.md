　　Abuse Leads to Wife's Death
    Xie Sunshi and Others Sentenced to Imprisonment
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to the Beijing Municipal News Office: The Beijing Municipal People's Court recently sentenced several cases of abuse of women, leading to death, so that criminals who oppress women receive due punishment before the people's law.
    Su Xiuling was only nineteen years old when she married Xie Tongjun, an apprentice at the Ruixiang Tannery, "through matchmaker's arrangements." After the marriage, she got up early and went to bed late every day, working diligently, but still often suffered abuse from her mother-in-law, Xie Sunshi, which caused her to miscarry after three months of pregnancy. On March 24th of this year, she had an argument with Xie Sunshi over a matter, and when Xie Tongjun returned from the factory, his mother complained to him about Su Xiuling, but Xie showed no sympathy for Su at all. Under such grievances and anger, she committed suicide by taking red alum that night. The Municipal People's Court, based on the facts, believed that Xie Sunshi's consistent oppression and abuse were the main cause of Su Xiuling's suicide by poisoning, and therefore sentenced her to two years of imprisonment. Xie Tongjun had always been unsympathetic to his wife's abuse and, after discovering that his wife had taken poison, did not make sufficient efforts to save her, thinking that it didn't matter if one died, he could just marry another (Xie conveniently arranged another engagement when he returned to his hometown to attend the funeral). Therefore, the court also sentenced him to one year of imprisonment, suspended for two years.
    Sun Wangshi, the wife of Sun Xuling at No. 63 Xianong Market, had been abusing her daughter-in-law, Sun Liu, for six years, often beating and scolding her for trivial matters. Sun Liu was seven months pregnant and was forced to hang herself on March 21st. The court has now sentenced Sun Wangshi to five years of imprisonment, and the deceased's husband, Sun Mengcheng, who failed to properly manage his family problems, was also sentenced to one year of imprisonment, suspended for two years.

　　虐待逼死媳妇
    谢孙氏等分处徒刑
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：京市人民法院日前判决了几件虐待妇女，以致逼死人命的案子，使压迫妇女的罪犯在人民的法律面前受到应得的惩处。
    苏秀玲十九岁时就“凭媒说合”嫁给了瑞祥皮厂学徒谢同均，婚后每天起早睡晚，辛勤操作，但仍时常遭受婆母谢孙氏的虐待，致使三个月的身孕流产。今年三月二十四日，她因事同谢孙氏吵嘴，谢同均自工厂回来，婆母又向谢埋怨苏秀玲，而谢对苏丝毫未表同情。在这样冤屈气愤下，当晚她就服红矾自杀了。市人民法院根据事实，认为谢孙氏一贯压迫虐待，是苏秀玲服毒自杀的主因，故判处徒刑二年。谢同均一向对妻子受虐待不予同情，发现妻子服毒之后，救治不力，以为死一个，再娶一个，无关重要（谢在回老家送丧之际，就顺便又订了婚）。因此，法院亦判以徒刑一年，缓刑二年。
    先农市场六十三号孙绪岭的妻子孙王氏，六年来一向虐待子媳孙刘氏，常为一点小事加以打骂。孙刘氏已怀孕七月，于三月二十一日被逼自缢。现法院已判孙王氏徒刑五年，死者的丈夫孙孟成不能适当处理自己的家庭问题，也被判了徒刑一年，缓刑二年。
