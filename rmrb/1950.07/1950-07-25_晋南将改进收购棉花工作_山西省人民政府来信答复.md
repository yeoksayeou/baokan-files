Editor's Note: In early July, our reader Dong Huamin sent a letter suggesting improvements to the cotton purchasing work in southern Shanxi. We immediately forwarded the letter to the Shanxi Provincial People's Government and requested a response. We recently received a reply from the Agricultural Department of the Shanxi Provincial Government, indicating their acceptance of Comrade Huamin's suggestions and proposing measures to improve this year's cotton purchasing work.

Comrade Editor:

This year, the three special districts of Linfen, Yuncheng, and Fenyang in Shanxi province, excluding Quwo and Houma which suffered hail damage, planted 1,788,943 mu of cotton. The average yield is 30 jin of lint cotton per mu, with an estimated total production of 54,762,561 jin. Last year, a considerable amount of cotton was also planted in this area, but the purchasing work had many biases. For example, the Jinan Trading Company, acting on behalf of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, decided to focus on purchasing lint cotton and not seed cotton. However, they did not pay attention to the cotton farmers' ginning problems, and did not ask relevant authorities to set up ginning factories or stations to help farmers gin the cotton. As a result, farmers had to turn to private merchants. Consequently, a large portion of the cotton, which was of excellent color and quality, was damaged during ginning. Some long-staple cotton was ginned into short-staple, some lustrous cotton was ginned into mixed-color inferior cotton, and some dry, clean cotton was ginned into broken-seed cotton. The good cotton produced by the farmers could not fetch a good price. Furthermore, the ginning fee was high; ginning 100 jin of lint cotton required 80 jin of wheat as payment. The farmers suffered significant losses. Therefore, I am making early suggestions for the autumn cotton purchasing work this year, hoping that the relevant authorities will organize this work in a planned and organized manner. First, supply and marketing cooperatives at the county level should be organized to equip ginning machines and organize the masses to gin cotton with animal-powered machines. However, since ginning equipment is limited, the focus should be on purchasing seed cotton, while also purchasing lint cotton. Efforts should be made to strengthen the grading and inspection work, and implement price differences according to grades, so that farmers can get the appropriate price for their cotton based on its quality, and not suffer losses. The public sector should also establish cotton production improvement offices in southern Shanxi to guide farmers in selecting cotton seeds and support production.

Dong Huamin

Comrade Dong Huamin:

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Agricultural Department has responded to your suggestions for improving the autumn cotton purchasing work in southern Shanxi. The reply is as follows:

Comrade Dong Huamin's suggestions are very good, and our department should adopt them. Many shortcomings occurred during the Trade Company's cotton purchase in Jinan last year. We have repeatedly studied prevention methods with the relevant agencies such as the Taiyuan Branch of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Industry Department. It is planned that this year, our department will establish three power cotton ginning mills in the purebred areas of Linfen, Jie County and Wenshui counties, and the Industry Department will establish twelve power cotton ginning mills and four oil pressing mills in other cotton producing areas. Machines are being purchased and factory sites are being built. As for cotton purchase, it is decided to strictly purchase according to grades. Our department has dispatched five people, the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation dispatched twenty people, and the cooperative dispatched twenty people to the Tianjin Raw Cotton Training Class to learn cotton grading technology in order to make the cotton purchase fair and reasonable this autumn. Temporarily, our department, each special commissioner's office and each county will send more capable cadres to inspect the work at any time, correct mistakes, and prevent farmers from suffering losses again.

### 晋南将改进收购棉花工作  山西省人民政府来信答复

　　晋南将改进收购棉花工作
    山西省人民政府来信答复
    编者按：七月初本报读者董化民来信建议改进晋南的收棉工作。我们当即将该信转山西省人民政府，请他们答复。日前收到了山西省府农业厅的回信，他们表示接受化民同志的意见，并提出改进今年收购棉花工作的办法。编辑同志：
    山西临汾、运城、汾阳三个专区、除曲沃、侯马地区受雹灾以外，今年植棉一百七十八万八千九百四十三亩，每亩平均产量皮棉三十斤，约计总产棉五千四百七十六万二千五百六十一斤。去年这地区也种了不少棉花，但是在采购工作中，曾发生很多偏向：比如晋南贸易公司代花纱布公司代购，他们决定以采购皮棉为主，不收籽棉。但他们又不注意棉农的轧花问题，未请有关机关设置轧花厂或轧花机站，帮助棉农轧花，于是棉农只得把收摘的籽棉交私商办理。结果，大部分色泽质量极佳的棉花都轧坏了。有的长绒轧成短绒，有的丝光好棉轧成杂色次花，有的干白净棉轧成破籽棉。棉农所产的好棉，都买不上好棉价格。而轧工工资又大，轧一百斤皮棉，要出工资麦八十斤。棉农利益损失不少。因此，对今年秋天的收棉工作，我及早提出建议，希望有关机关在组织这一工作时，必须要有计划、有组织地进行。首先组织县供销社、设备轧花机，组织群众轧车代轧。但因轧花设备有限，即应以收购籽棉为主，兼收皮棉。加强分级检验等级差价工作，使棉农按棉花品质卖得应得的价钱，不叫农民吃亏。公家并应在晋南设立棉产改进处等，指导棉农拣选棉种，扶植生产。
                                董化民董化民同志：
    你所提出的关于改进今秋晋南收棉工作的建议，山西省人民政府农业厅已有答复。复信如下：
    董化民同志的建议是很好的，本厅应该采纳。去年贸易公司在晋南收购棉花时，发生很多缺点，我们曾与花纱布太原分公司、供销合作社及工业厅等有关机关，一再研究防止办法。拟定今年由本厅在纯种区的临汾、解县、文水等县建立动力轧花厂三个，在其他产棉多的地方由工业厅建立动力轧花厂十二个、榨油厂四个。现正购置机器、修建厂址。至于收购棉花，决定严格的分等级收购，本厅已派遣五人，花纱布公司二十人，合作社二十人往天津原棉训练班学习棉花分等分级的技术，以使今秋收购棉花公平合理。临时并将由本厅、各专署及各县多派得力干部，随时检查工作，纠正错误，不令棉农再有吃亏情事。
