Korean National Hero Li Shunchen
    —In Response to Questions from Zhang Qingtan and Luo Changli
    To the Editor: In the "Korean People's Patriotic Enthusiasm" column on page four of the People's Daily on the 16th of this month, we saw a news item entitled "Korea Formulates Li Shunchen Medal." Please introduce the history of the Korean national hero Li Shunchen in more detail.
                                  Workers Zhang Qingtian, Luo Changli.To Comrades Zhang Qingtian and Luo Changli:

    In the late sixteenth century, Japan attempted to invade Korea for the first time. The Japanese army landed in Busan at the southern end of the peninsula and attacked the Korean capital, Seoul, in eighteen days. At that time, China, Korea's ally, sent 200,000 troops to aid in the rescue. In order to achieve a decisive victory, Japan also sent a large number of naval and ground forces to reinforce. As a result, the Japanese navy was defeated by the Korean fleet, and 120,000 Japanese soldiers were buried at sea. This is a glorious page in Korean national history. The commander of this fleet was General Li Shunchen, the Korean national hero.
    General Li Shunchen was a famous general in Korean history. He was born in Seoul on March 8, 1545. At the age of forty-seven, he served as the Naval Commander of Jeolla Left Province in Korea, defending the coast. He had long foreseen Japan's ambition to invade Korea and China, so he actively built naval ports, built warships, and expanded equipment. Among the many weapons he created, the most famous was a new type of armored warship at that time called "Geobukseon" (meaning turtle ship in Korean), which was shaped like a turtle. The deck was like a turtle's back, with countless awls and knives, covered with straw mats for concealment. The deck had only narrow cross passages for traffic. There were twenty-four gun holes and twenty large oars on all sides. The ship's head had a "dragon head" that could spray poisonous gas and smoke, and the rear had a "turtle tail." The hull was made of extremely hard wood, as strong as iron armor, which could not only withstand guns and cannons, but also smash enemy ships. This warship achieved great results in the Korean nation's war against Japan. From 1592 to 1598, he fought many fierce naval battles with the Japanese navy on the seas of Hansan Island, Busan, Okpo, and Danghangpo. Thanks to his outstanding tactics, successful mobilization of soldiers, and emphasis on integration with the people, he achieved brilliant victories in combat. In a battle on November 19, 1598, he personally supervised the battle and was killed by a bullet. At the time of his death, he ordered his two sons to continue issuing orders to direct the battle, so as not to let his subordinates and the enemy know the bad news of his death, so as not to affect the morale of the soldiers and encourage the enemy's arrogance. The Korean people, old and young, know about the deeds of this famous general who died for his country. Today, the heroic Korean People's Army is constantly learning his outstanding tactics and patriotism, and striving for the independence and reunification of their motherland. The great name of General Li Shunchen is immortal in the history of the Korean nation's quest for independence and freedom.

　　朝鲜民族英雄李舜臣
    ——答张清田、罗长礼问
    编辑同志：我们在本月十六日人民日报四版《朝鲜人民的爱国热潮》一栏内，看到《朝鲜制定李舜臣勋章》一则新闻。请将朝鲜民族英雄李舜臣的历史比较详细地介绍一下。
                                  工人张清田、罗长礼。张清田  罗长礼同志：
    十六世纪末期，日本首次企图侵占朝鲜。日本军队在半岛南端釜山登陆，十八天就攻抵朝鲜国都汉城。当时朝鲜的盟国——中国派了二十万大军援救。日本为取得决定性胜利，也派大量海陆军增援。结果日本的海军被朝鲜的舰队打得落花流水，十二万日军葬身鱼腹。这是朝鲜民族历史上光辉的一页。这舰队的司令就是朝鲜的民族英雄李舜臣将军。
    李舜臣将军是朝鲜历史上的名将。一五四五年三月八日出生于汉城，四十七岁时任朝鲜全南左道水军节度使，镇守海岸。他早就看出日本侵略朝鲜与中国的野心，因此积极修筑军港，建造战舰，扩充装备。在他所创造的许多武器中，最著名的是一种当时最新式的装甲战船“格铺申”（朝鲜语龟船的意思），形状极似乌龟，甲板如龟背，上有无数锥刀，上铺草席以为隐蔽。甲板上只有十字窄道可以通行。四周共有枪眼二十四个、大橹二十支。船头有能喷毒气与烟雾的“龙头”，船后有“龟尾”。船身是用极坚硬木材制成，牢如铁甲，不但能抵枪炮，且可撞碎敌舰。这种战舰在朝鲜民族反抗日本的战争中得到了很大战果。在一五九二年至一五九八年七年中，与日本海军在闲山岛、釜山、玉浦、唐项浦等海面上进行过许多次激烈海战，由于他采取卓越战术，成功地动员战士，重视与人民结合，在作战中获得了辉煌胜利。在一五九八年十一月十九日的一次战役中，他亲自督战，中弹阵亡。临终时他命令其两子继续发号指挥作战，不让部属和敌方晓得他战死的噩耗，以免影响士兵的斗志，而助长敌方气焰。这一位名将以身殉国的事迹，朝鲜人民不论老幼无不知晓。今天英勇的朝鲜人民军正在不断学习他的卓越战术与爱国精神，为自己祖国的独立统一而奋争。李舜臣将军的英名在朝鲜民族求独立自由的历史上是永垂不朽的。
