　　Uphold World Peace, Oppose American Aggression
    More Than 2,000 Vendors in the Sixth District Gather
    Deshengmen Market Management Committee Also Holds Meetings and Discussions
    [This Newspaper's Report] To respond to the movement against American imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, vendors in the Sixth District of Beijing held mass meetings at Qing Le, Hua Bei, and Jin Cheng Theaters on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, with a total of more than 2,000 vendors attending. At the meetings, cadres from the Sixth District Vendors Management Office gave a brief explanation of the current crimes of aggression by imperialism and its outwardly strong but inwardly weak and embarrassing situation; they also made a significant comparison between the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp and the rising forces of peace and democracy; and called on everyone to work hard to win the victory of peace. The vendors expressed their views one after another, resolutely supporting world peace, supporting the Korean people, and demanding the speedy liberation of Taiwan. Li Shirong, the representative of the Xiheyan vendors, said angrily: "We must defeat the aggression of imperialism so that the whole world can enjoy lasting peace!" Shi Guichen, the representative of Dongheyan, firmly said: "Taiwan is our Taiwan, and we must liberate it!" After the meeting, Old Man Du, a vendor in Dajiangjia Hutong who is more than seventy years old, was still saying to the vendors sitting next to him: "American imperialism ran into a big nail in China, and now it's running into a nail in Korea, it really deserves to be killed!"
