Xinhua News Agency, 15th -- The National Civil Affairs Conference convened by the Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government began on the 15th. Ninety-two responsible cadres from civil affairs departments of major administrative regions, provinces (municipalities), and administrative offices attended, with 116 personnel from relevant central and local organs attending as observers.

The conference agenda is expected to conclude in two weeks.

Minister Xie pointed out in his opening speech: The scope of civil affairs work is very broad, and it should start with the most important tasks. If the important tasks are done well, other work will have a foundation; and experience can be gained to help the smooth development of other work. At the same time, attention should also be paid to coordination with other work departments. Therefore, in addition to summarizing work, this conference is only prepared to focus on discussing the issue of establishing governance.

Secretary-General Lin emphasized in his speech that after defeating the reactionary regime, the Chinese people must smash the old regime's institutions and re-establish the people's political organization in order to consolidate the revolution and carry out construction work. Secretary-General Lin also pointed out that the construction of governments at all levels must implement the principle of democratic centralism.
