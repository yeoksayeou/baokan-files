　　Northeastern State-Owned Enterprises Emphasize Tax Payment
    Tax Authorities at All Levels Improve Tax Payment Procedures
    [This newspaper Shenyang News] Public enterprises in various parts of Northeast China attach great importance to the central government's tax regulations for public enterprises. In order to strengthen working relationships with various enterprises, tax authorities at all levels have successively held symposiums for public enterprises to study and improve tax payment procedures and other issues.

    During the collection of business tax for the first quarter of this year in April, the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration Bureau, the Northeast Railway General Bureau, and the Forestry Bureau, among others, voluntarily paid their due taxes to the tax authorities within three or four days. After the promulgation of the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations, various enterprise units under the Ministry of Trade also paid taxes locally. Units such as the Harbin Native Produce General Factory promptly completed tax payment procedures upon receiving tax payment notices, ensuring the timely deposit of tax revenues. Some enterprises, such as the North Manchuria Branch of the Northeast Fuel Company and the Harbin Office of the Northeast Film Studio, proactively calculated their March tax liabilities and paid them to the tax bureau before receiving notices. In addition, the Northeast Chemical Bureau and the Northeast Electrical Engineering Bureau, due to delayed tax payments, proactively submitted written guarantees to the Northeast Regional Tax Bureau, pledging to prevent future delays and designating specific personnel to handle tax payment procedures.

    In order to facilitate tax payments by public enterprises and assist various factories and mines in completing their production tasks, the Northeast Regional Tax Administration Bureau instructed provincial and municipal bureaus to prioritize the establishment of public tax payment windows (which have now been established in cities such as Shenyang, Fushun, and Anshan), and established a State-Owned and Public Enterprise Tax Payment Section within the Regional Bureau's Tax Policy Department on June 15th, specifically responsible for handling public tax payment matters, promptly addressing public tax payment business, and strengthening working relationships with the leading organs of these enterprises. In addition, local tax bureaus (such as the Harbin, Benxi, Andong, and Tieling bureaus) have successively held symposiums for public enterprises on tax payment, resolving procedural issues that existed in the past regarding tax reporting and verification, and assigning personnel to be stationed at larger factories and mines to collect taxes. All of these measures have further strengthened the connection and cooperation between tax bureaus and local public enterprises, which will become a powerful guarantee for the implementation of tax policies.

　　东北国营企业重视纳税
    各级税务机关改进完税手续
    【本报沈阳讯】东北各地公营企业对中央公营企业纳税规定极为重视；各级税务机关为加强对各企业的工作联系，先后召开公营企业座谈会，研究改进完税手续等问题。
    在今年四月中征收本年第一季度营业税时，东北邮电管理总局，东北铁路总局和林务局等均先后在三四天内即主动地向税务机关完纳应缴税款。贸易部所属的各企业单位，在工商税条例公布后，也都在当地缴了税。哈市土产总厂等单位接到纳税通知书，即及时办理纳税手续，保证了税款的及时入库。有的企业如东北燃料公司北满总分公司、东影驻哈办事处等单位，在未接通知书前，就主动算出三月份应纳税款到税局完纳。此外东北化工局和东北电工局因迟纳了税款，即主动地向东北区税局提出书面保证，今后要作到没有迟纳情形发生，并决定指派专人办理纳税手续。
    东北区税务管理局为便利公营企业纳税，以协助各厂矿完成生产任务，又指示各省市局有重点地设立公营纳税窗口（如沈市、抚顺、鞍山等地现已设立），并自六月十五日起于区局税政处内成立了国营、公营企业纳税科，专责办理公营纳税事宜，以及时处理公营纳税业务与加强和各该企业领导机关的工作联系。此外，各地税局（如哈市、本溪、安东、铁岭等局）并先后召开公营企业纳税座谈会，解决了过去报税、查验等方面存在的手续问题，以及各地税局于较大厂矿派人驻厂收税等等，均使税局与各地公营企业间取得进一步的联系与合作，而将成为贯彻税收政策的有力保证。（武静寰）
