　　Rational Felling and Utilization of Forests
    Wei Zhenwu
    The forest area in Northeast China accounts for more than 52% of the total forest area in the country, and its timber reserves account for about three-fifths of the country's total reserves. Coniferous trees account for 58% of the total forest reserves in Northeast China, and broad-leaved trees account for 42%. The timber in Northeast China is most suitable for industrial, mining, transportation, and construction purposes. This is an extremely valuable resource and wealth of our country and is the main base for the supply of timber for national economic construction. If it can be well managed and protected, and rationally felled and utilized, so that the annual felling volume does not exceed the annual growth of the forest, and the natural and artificial regeneration of the forest is guaranteed, and felling is carried out in rotation, it can not only maintain and expand the country's forest resources, but also guarantee the supply of timber for the country's long-term construction.
    In the past, the history of forest felling and utilization in Northeast China was very painful. After the plunder-style felling during the reigns of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, feudal warlords, and especially Japanese imperialism, not only was a large amount of timber lost, but also a large part of the forest was destroyed. First, the forests along both sides of the railway, along both sides of the river, and near cities with convenient transportation have been subjected to excessive and unlimited large-scale felling. During the puppet Manchukuo period alone, 100 million cubic meters of timber were lost! Second, the selective felling method of "cutting the good ones" was adopted, and a large number of coniferous trees, even young coniferous trees that were still in the growing stage, were felled, while the "red sugar bags," "ant posts," and "standing poles" and other diseased trees were all left untouched, which promoted the spread and development of diseases. The broad-leaved trees such as poplar and birch were not well utilized, and coniferous mother trees were not well selected and retained, so the felled forest farms have seen a large development of birch trees. This selective felling method seriously harmed the recovery and development of the forest. Not only has the forest generally decreased, but most of the decrease has been in coniferous trees with good material, while birch trees with poorer material have relatively increased. Third, the tree roots left during felling were very high, averaging about 70 centimeters or more, and the part near the roots was good material. The treetops that could be used for timber were not utilized and were not cleared in the forest farm. As a result, they all rotted. Only the middle part of a good tree was used. This not only wasted timber and bred diseases, but also affected the natural regeneration of the forest. Fourth, felling and transportation were not combined. Some of the felled timber could not be transported out at all due to the terrain and transportation equipment of some forest farms, or could not be transported out in time. Therefore, felled trees from the puppet Manchukuo period can be seen everywhere in the forests of Northeast China, and they are all good pine trees. After August 15, a large part of them has been cleared by the Northeast Forestry Bureau and transported for use, but there is still a considerable part rotting in the mountains and forests. In addition, some naturally fallen trees (rotten dead trees) and unutilized treetop wood, branches, and leaves are piled in the forest farm, which has created a messy situation in the forest, and these rotten trees and dead branches are most likely to cause forest fires. Fifth, in terms of timber use, various tree species have never been well utilized. Not only are people unfamiliar with the characteristics of various trees, thereby failing to give full play to their utilization value, but there is also a serious waste in use. Many that can be used are not used, and many that can be saved are not saved.
    All of the above situations have seriously damaged the vitality of the forests in Northeast China. The annual number of unreasonable fellings plus the losses from fires and other factors has greatly exceeded the annual growth. If this situation continues, it will not only affect the use of timber and national construction, but also worsen the climate and cause disasters such as wind, sand, and floods. This is a serious topic for our forestry workers after the complete liberation of Northeast China. Today, the forest belongs to the people's country. The People's Government must protect the country's forest wealth. On the one hand, it must eliminate the old habits of unreasonable felling and cherish the use of this part of the forest wealth for the construction of the new China. On the other hand, it must heal the wounds and actively restore and expand the forest wealth of Northeast China.
    In order to support the People's Liberation War and restore and develop economic construction, Northeast China's forestry has supplied a large amount of timber to the country. At the same time, with the recovery and development of the economy, the production equipment of forestry itself has also been gradually restored, and a group of forestry cadres and technicians have been trained, as well as a large number of skilled workers, laying the foundation for forestry production and construction. When Northeast China was completely liberated, in terms of forestry production, we immediately put forward the slogan of rational felling and utilization of forests. This year, we began to implement rational felling and achieved preliminary results. More importantly, we have gained some experience, and we have a clearer direction for forest felling and utilization. Although this experience is superficial, forestry experts need to conduct further research and formulate a complete set of methods. Especially in terms of rational felling and utilization, based on preliminary experience, new requirements that can be realized and must be realized should be further proposed:
    1.  In terms of reducing stump height: In the past, tree stumps were left very high, averaging about 70 centimeters. In the 1950 felling, the Northeast Forestry Bureau stipulated that the maximum stump height should not exceed 30 centimeters. At present, 70% have met this requirement, and the lowest have been reduced to below 10 centimeters. The overall average is 20 centimeters. In the past, loggers felled trees while standing, but now they kneel down to fell trees, which is a progress. Because of this reduction in stump height, 250,000 cubic meters of timber has been added compared to the previous year. The Northeast Forestry Bureau now proposes a new requirement: to reduce the stump height by another 10 centimeters, that is, the remaining stump should not exceed 20 centimeters.
    2.  In terms of utilizing treetop wood: The Northeast Forestry Bureau stipulates that treetops with a diameter of more than 6 centimeters after felling should be used for timber production. As a result of the implementation, 34% have met this requirement, which can add about 50,000 cubic meters of timber compared to the previous year. However, the results in this area are not significant. There are still 70,000 cubic meters of usable material left in the forest farm and lost. In the future, it is required that all possible parts must be used for timber production. The treetop wood can be used to make pit props, tie rods, and other small-diameter timber. If the treetop parts can be generally used as special timber for small-diameter wood, the felling volume of small trees can be greatly reduced, which is very beneficial to forest conservation.
    3.  Selecting and retaining mother trees: In order to enable the forest to regenerate naturally, excellent mother trees must be selected and retained during felling to facilitate natural seeding. The Northeast Forestry Bureau stipulated last year that 10 mother trees per hectare must be retained. About half of the felled forest farms have implemented the retention of mother trees. In the future, it is required that 15 to 20 mother trees should be retained per hectare, and the retained mother trees must be healthy, disease-free, have good tree shape, and be strong trees with many seeds. At the same time, the future development of the forest must be considered, and more tree species with high utilization value should be retained for propagation. Experience has proved that in order to ensure that the mother trees are well retained, forestry technicians must conduct a thorough inspection of the site and mark the trees before felling. All mother trees that have been marked are strictly prohibited from felling. If only relying on the felling workers to retain trees at will, the results will definitely be very poor.
    4.  Implementing selective felling and strip clear-cutting: According to the forest conditions in the Northeast forest area (some have been felled two or three times), transportation equipment conditions, and funding situation, most forest farms still need to adopt selective felling methods, but special attention should be paid to not leaving diseased trees, standing poles, and rotten wood in the forest, and at the same time, precious tree species such as cork tree, ash, and walnut should be used sparingly and felled in a planned manner. Poplar and birch trees should be felled and utilized as much as possible, and young trees that have not reached the felling period should be prohibited from felling.
    In addition to selective felling operations, strip operations can also be adopted. According to the forest survey and management plan, forest areas, forest sections, and forest numbers are divided, and then the order of felling is determined according to the forest age of each forest section and forest number. First, felling trees of suitable age and old trees. In each forest section and forest number, except for the retained mother trees and young trees with high utilization value, all trees in the strip are clear-cut regardless of tree species and material type. This clear-cutting method is the most scientific and reasonable felling method. After a section of forest is felled, it can be restored after 20 to 30 years, forming a new forest with more uniform tree species and tree age. At present, due to the limitations of various conditions, clear-cutting cannot be generally implemented. The Northeast Forestry Bureau has decided to conduct trials in some forest farms this winter, with a view to gradually transitioning from selective felling to clear-cutting.
    5.  Timber utilization: The use of timber must be in accordance with the principles of science and economy. First, we must understand the nature and characteristics of various trees, "make materials according to trees," so as to give full play to the utilization value of timber. At the same time, we should also "use materials according to their quantity." For example, the base part of the tree should be used as long timber, the middle part should be used as sleeper raw materials as much as possible, and the treetop part should be used as pit props and various small-diameter timber as much as possible. Past waste phenomena must be corrected. When making sleepers, white pine, larch, and fir can be used as much as possible, and good red pine should not be used as sleepers. High-quality hardwoods such as cork tree, ash, and oak should be used for various woodenware and construction timber. Precious small trees should be prohibited from being used as car pillars, tie rods, or wasted casually. At present, papermaking in Northeast China completely uses white pine logs, which is extremely unreasonable. Other tree species should be used instead, and broken wood should be used more for pulp. The Northeast lumber industry has made great progress in 1950. Among the timber produced in this year, except for pit props, electric poles, papermaking materials, boat materials, and piles, the vast majority of the rest is processed into finished timber by sawmills after processing the logs, which is a great improvement in timber use. The material yield rate of log processing in sawmills is also constantly increasing, and some bark has been used to make sawmill boxes, gray strips, etc. In addition, such as making plywood, a lot of unused birch and linden wood can be used. After sleepers and electric poles are treated with preservatives, the utilization value of timber can be improved, and timber consumption can be greatly reduced. Northeast China originally had some foundation for wood dry distillation plants, which were destroyed on August 15. The restoration of these plywood factories, dry distillation plants, and anticorrosion factories is now underway in order to make good use of timber.
    6.  Cleaning up forest farms: In order to renew the felled forests and prevent the spread of diseases and the occurrence of forest fires, the forest farms must be cleaned up after felling. Northeast China began to pay attention to this matter during the winter felling last year and has implemented it in some forest farms. The forest farms that have been felled in the past must also be cleaned up in a planned manner, which is a considerable project. Although a considerable amount of funds is spent now, the future benefits are infinite, which is more cost-effective than reforestation. The forest administration department has formulated a plan to realize this plan with emphasis and steps.
    Implementing rational felling is an urgent and major issue in the forestry of Northeast China. Not only should it be discussed in scientific theory, but more importantly, how to implement it. A new thing will inevitably have difficulties when it is first implemented, and experience has proved that the main difficulty is the obstacle of outdated, backward, and conservative thinking. When rational felling was first proposed, many cadres thought that "it is good, but I am afraid it cannot be done," but after the training in practical work, it has been proved that rational felling is not only good, but also can be done. Rational felling and utilization of forests is only a beginning in Northeast China and needs to be continuously improved and improved in practical work, with a view to gradually making it a complete system. This is not only the ideal of forestry in Northeast China but also the ideal of forestry in the whole country.

　　森林的合理采伐与利用
    魏震五
    东北森林面积占全国森林总面积百分之五十二强，其木材蓄积量，约占全国总蓄积量的五分之三，其中针叶树占东北森林总蓄积量的百分之五八，阔叶树占百分之四二。东北的林木最适宜于工矿交通建筑用材。这是我们国家极宝贵的资源财富，是全国经济建设木材供应的主要基地。如果能管理保护得好，又能合理的采伐利用，使每年的采伐量不超过森林每年的生长量，保证森林天然的和人工的更新，作到轮流采伐，不仅可保持与扩大国家的森林资源，更可保证国家长远建设木材的供给。
    过去东北森林采伐利用的史实，是很令人痛心的。经过满清、封建军阀、特别是日本帝国主义统治时期掠夺式的采伐，不仅损失了大量的木材，而且也毁坏了很大一部分森林。第一、对沿铁路两侧、河流两岸、及靠近城市运输较方便的森林，均遭受过度的无限制的大量采伐，仅伪满时期就损失了一亿立方米的木材！第二、采取“光选好的砍”的择伐方法，把大量的针叶树甚至还在生长期中的幼龄针叶树，也采伐了下来，而把“红糖包”、“蚂蚁哨”、“站杆”等病树，全部留下未动，这就助长了病害的传播与发展。对于阔叶树的杨、桦等则未经很好的利用，也未很好的选留针叶树母树，所以已采伐过的林场，使桦树大量发展起来了。这样的择伐方法，严重地危害了森林的恢复与发展。森林不仅一般的减少了，而且所减少的又大部分是材质很好的针叶树，材质较差的桦树却相对的增加了。第三、采伐时留的树根很高，平均约在七十公分以上，而靠根这一部分又是好材，树梢头部分可利用造材的未被利用，留在林场里又未清理，结果都腐烂了，很好的树只用了中间一部分，这不仅浪费木材，滋生病害，更影响了森林的天然更新。第四、采伐与运搬没有结合起来，已采伐的林木有些林场限于地形和交通设备，根本运不出来，或者不能及时运出，因此在东北森林里面随处可见伪满时期伐倒的树木，而且都是很好的松树。八一五以后，已由东北林务局清理出一大部分运出使用，但还有为数不小的部分腐朽在山林里。再加上一部分自然倒木（腐烂的死树）和未被利用的梢头木、枝叶，都堆在林场里边，这就造成了森林里的芜杂现象，而这些败树枯枝又最易引起山林火灾。第五、在用材方面，对于各种树种从来没有很好的利用过，不仅不熟悉各种树的特性，从而发挥其利用价值，并在使用上存在着严重的浪费现象，很多可以利用的，未被利用，可以节省的也未被节省。
    所有以上这些情况，都极严重地损害了东北森林的元气：仅以每年不合理的采伐数字加上火灾等的损失，就已大大的超过了每年的生长量。这种情况如果继续下去，不仅影响用材和国家的建设，而且将使气候变坏，引起风沙水患等灾害；这就是东北全部解放后，给予我们林业工作者严重的课题；今天森林已属于人民的国家所有，人民政府必须保护国家的森林财富，一方面要消灭历来不合理采伐的旧习，珍惜使用这一部分森林财富，用之于新中国的建设，另一方面要医治创伤，积极恢复与扩大东北的森林财富。
    为了支援人民解放战争，恢复与发展经济建设，东北林业曾以大量木材供给国家，同时，随着经济的恢复与发展，也逐步恢复了林业本身的生产设备，培养了一批林业干部与技术人员，更培养出大批的技术工人，开始打下了林业生产建设基础。当东北全部解放后，在林业生产方面，我们立即提出了合理采伐利用森林的口号，今年即开始实行了合理采伐，并获得了初步成绩。更重要的是取得了一些经验，对于森林采伐利用也有了较为明确的方向。虽然这一点经验是粗浅的，还须林业专家作进一步研究，制订出一套完整的办法。特别在合理采伐与利用方面，应根据初步的经验，更进一步提出可能实现和必须实现的新要求：
    一、在降低伐根方面：过去树根留的很高，平均约七十公分，一九五○年度采伐，东北林务局规定：采伐时留根最高不得超过三十公分，目前已有百分之七十达到了这个要求，最低的有降到十公分以下的，总的平均数是二十公分。过去伐木工人是站着伐，现在改为跪下伐，这是一种进步，由于这样降低了伐根，就比上年多出了二五○、○○○立方米木材。东北林务局现再提出新的要求：要伐根再降低十公分，即遗留的树根不得超过二十公分。
    二、在利用梢头木方面：东北林务局规定：伐倒树木的梢径在六公分以上者，要使用造材，经执行的结果，已有百分之三十四达到这个要求，比上年约可多出五○、○○○立方米木材，但在这方面的成绩还不大，仍有七○、○○○立方米可用之材，留在林场里损失了。今后要求凡可能利用的部分必须全部造材利用。梢头木部分可以利用来制坑木、交手杆等小径用材，如能普遍利用梢头部分作小径木的特殊用材，则可大量减少小树的采伐量，这对森林保育非常有益。
    三、选留母树：为了使森林能够天然更新，采伐时一定要选留优良母树，以便于天然下种，东北林务局去年规定每公顷须留母树十株，采伐林场约有半数实行保留母树。今后要求每公顷应留母树十五株到二十株，且所留的母树必须是健康、无病害，树形好、结籽多的壮年树。同时须考虑到森林发展的前途，应多留利用价值高的树种，以便繁殖。经验证明为了保证母树留的好，必须在采伐前由林业技术人员实行周详的验场砍号，凡号了印的母树，一律禁止采伐。若仅靠采伐工人随意去留，结果一定很不好。
    四、实行择伐与带形皆伐：根据东北林区森林状况（有的已采伐过二三遍），交通设备条件及资金情形，目前大部林场还须采取择伐办法，但应特别注意的不可把病树、站杆、朽木等留在林内，同时对珍贵树种如黄波罗、水曲柳、核桃楸等应节省使用，有计划的采伐，对于杨、桦树应尽量采伐利用，对于未达伐期的幼龄树，应禁止采伐。
    除择伐作业外，也可采用带形作业方法，根据森林调查和施业方案，划分林区和林段林号，然后按照每个林段林号的林龄情况，确定采伐的次序。首先采伐适龄林与老龄林。在每林段林号内，除保留的母树与利用价值高的幼树外，在带形内不分树种、材种一律皆伐。这种皆伐方法是最科学最合理的采伐方法。一段森林采伐后，经过二三十年就可恢复起来，形成树种和树龄更整齐一致的新生林。目前由于各种条件的限制，还不能普遍的实行皆伐，东北林务局已决定今冬在部分林场试行，以期逐渐的由择伐过渡到皆伐。
    五、木材利用：对于木材使用，必须合于科学和经济的原则，首先要了解各种树木的性质与特点，“看树作材”，以发挥木材利用价值。同时还应“量材使用”，比如树木的基干部分应利用作长材，中段部分应尽量利用作枕木原料，梢头部分应尽量用作坑木及各种小径木材。过去的浪费现象，必须加以纠正。作枕木时可尽量利用白松、落叶松、臭松等，而不应用红松良材作枕木。黄波罗、水曲柳、柞树等良质硬木，应利用做各种木器及建筑用材。珍贵小树应禁用作车柱、交手杆或随便糟蹋。现东北造纸完全用白松原木，极不合理，应改用其他树种代替，并应多利用零碎木材作纸浆。东北制材工业，一九五○年有很大的发展，在本年度所生产的木材之中，除坑木、电柱、造纸材、船材、桩木等外，其余绝大部分是将原木经过火锯厂加工制成成材，这对木材使用上是很大的进步。而火锯厂原木加工的出材率亦在不断的增加着，有些板皮已利用制锯木箱、灰条子等。此外如制胶合板，可利用很多未被利用的桦木和椴木。枕木、电柱经防腐处理后，可提高木材利用价值，大量节省木材消耗；木材干馏工厂，东北原有一些基础，八一五时已遭破坏。对于这些胶合板厂、干馏工厂及防腐工厂等，现正着手恢复，以便很好的利用木材。
    六、清理林场：为着把已采伐过的森林更新，防止病害的传播和发生山林火灾，林场采伐后，必须进行清理工作。东北去年冬采伐时已开始注意此事，并已在部分林场实行，对于已往采伐过的林场，还须有计划的进行清理，这是一件相当大的工程。现在虽花费一笔可观的资金，而将来的利益却是无穷的，比较重新造林都要合算得多，林政部门已订出有重点有步骤的去实现这一计划。
    实行合理采伐，是东北林业方面一个迫切而且重大的课题，不仅应在科学理论上进行研讨，而更重要的是如何贯彻实施。一个新的事物在开始实行时不免有困难，而经验证明，最主要的困难却是陈旧落后保守思想的阻碍，在一开始提出合理采伐时，好多干部认为“好是好，恐怕办不到”，但经过实际工作中的锻炼，证明了合理采伐不但好，而且可以办得到。合理的采伐与利用森林，在东北才不过是一个开端，还要在实际工作中不断的改进与提高，以期逐步的使成为一套完整的制度。这不仅是东北林业的理想，也是全国林业的理想。
