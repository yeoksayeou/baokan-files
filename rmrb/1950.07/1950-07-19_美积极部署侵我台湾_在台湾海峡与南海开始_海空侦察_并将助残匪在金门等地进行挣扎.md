Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Since U.S. President Truman issued a statement on June 27th regarding the invasion of our Taiwan Province, the United States has been conducting various armed interventions in Taiwan. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 16th, MacArthur announced on the 16th that the U.S. Seventh Fleet has begun "air and sea reconnaissance" in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Prior to this, the U.S. Seventh Fleet had already established a sea and air liaison organization with the remnant Kuomintang bandits. On July 6th, eight "communications experts" from the fleet arrived in Taiwan from Manila to establish radio communication equipment. On the 8th, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Struble arrived in Taiwan from Japan and held consultations with Chiang Kai-shek and other bandit leaders.

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Taipei on the 9th, Struble discussed the following four points with the remnant Kuomintang bandits: 1. To use Taiwan as a U.S. naval base; 2. To exchange intelligence and espionage; 3. "Cooperation" between the Seventh Fleet and the bandit air force; 4. The issue of Taiwan's defense. Before Struble arrived in Taiwan, the bandit Taiwan radio station broadcast on the 6th that MacArthur would organize a delegation to Taiwan, not only to control Taiwan, but also to help the remnant bandits struggle on islands such as Kinmen and Lingding, and to conduct air and sea harassment against our mainland.

    【新华社十八日讯】自美国总统杜鲁门于六月二十七日发表侵略我国台湾省的声明后，美国已对台湾进行各种武装干涉的活动。据美新闻处华盛顿十六日电，麦克阿瑟于十六日宣布，美国第七舰队已开始在台湾海峡与南海进行“海空侦察”。在此以前，美国第七舰队已与国民党残匪建立了海空联络机构。七月六日，该舰队“通讯专家”八人由马尼拉抵达台湾，建立无线电联络的设备。八日，美第七舰队司令史枢波由日本抵达台湾，曾与蒋贼介石及其他匪首进行会商。
    据法新社台北九日电报道，史枢波曾与国民党残匪就下列四点进行商谈：一、将台湾作为美国海军基地；二、交换情报与谍报；三、第七舰队与匪空军之间的“合作”；四、台湾防务问题。在史枢波到台湾之前，匪台湾电台六日广播即透露：麦克阿瑟将组织代表团赴台，除了控制台湾外，并将帮助残匪在金门、伶仃等岛进行挣扎，以及对我国大陆进行海空骚扰。
