Title: Northeast Water Conservancy Spring Repair Project Basically Completed; Building Embankments and Digging Channels Reached Three Thousand Li; Can Protect 600,000 Hectares of Land from Floods; Some New Embankments Have Loose Soil and Are Prone to Subsidence, Requiring Enhanced Inspection

(Shenyang News) *Northeast Daily* news: The Northeast region's water conservancy spring repair project has been basically completed, which can protect 600,000 hectares of land from floods.

Since mid-April, the region's water conservancy spring repair project has, to date, newly built 528 kilometers of embankments, totaling 17,436,600 cubic meters of earthwork; repaired 673 kilometers of embankments, totaling 7,865,000 cubic meters of earthwork; newly dug 412 kilometers of drainage ditches and rivers, totaling 6,161,600 cubic meters of earthwork; and constructed 152 kilometers of bank protection works. The total area of land benefiting from this project is 600,164 hectares, and it involved approximately 10 million man-days of labor, as well as 4 million man-days of voluntary labor organized by the various provinces.

This year's water control project in the region took less than three months to complete and was carried out during the busiest seasons of spring plowing and summer weeding. In counties with heavy workloads, such as Liaozhong and Taian, which are disaster areas, more than half of the able-bodied labor force was mobilized to participate in embankment repairs during the spring plowing and summer weeding. Generally, a work exchange system was adopted in various locations. Those who repaired embankments were guaranteed to repair them well, while those who stayed home were guaranteed to plant the land. As a result, the morale of the workers was high, and they created many new construction methods and produced a large number of labor models, ensuring the timely completion of the embankment repairs and achieving both embankment repair and production without any delay.

However, there are still serious shortcomings in the construction process, such as emphasizing quantity over quality. For example, in the Beisha River embankment construction project in Liaodong Province, the construction did not meet the standards. The original plan called for a top width of two meters and a slope of 1:1.5, but the actual top width was less than two meters, and the slope was only 1:1.2. At the same time, the filled soil was too loose to withstand the impact of floods, resulting in two breaches on June 8, flooding more than 20,000 mu of land. There were also instances of sloppy construction that did not meet the standards in irrigation projects. For example, in the old embankment repair project, some of the upstream and downstream heights and widths were inconsistent. This phenomenon deserves serious attention and should be strictly inspected.

### 东北水利春修工程基本完成  筑堤挖渠达三千余里  可使六十万垧土地免受水患  部分新堤土松易陷亟须加强检查

　　东北水利春修工程基本完成
    筑堤挖渠达三千余里
    可使六十万垧土地免受水患
    部分新堤土松易陷亟须加强检查
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北全区水利春修工程已基本完成，可使六十万垧土地免除水患。
    该区水利春修工程，从四月中旬开始以来，到目前为止，新筑堤防五百二十八公里，计土方一千七百四十三万六千六百公方；补修堤防六百七十三公里，土方七百八十六万五千公方；新挖排水渠及挖河四百一十二公里，土方六百一十六万一千六百公方；护岸工程一百五十二公里。总计受益土地面积为六十万零一千六百四十垧，共动用了民工约一千万个工及由各省组织的义务劳动工四百万个。
    今年该区的治水工程，施工不足三个月，而且是在春耕和夏锄最忙季节进行的。工程较多的县，如辽中、台安等灾区，在春耕夏锄中都动员了半数以上的整劳力参加修堤。各地一般采取了换工办法，修堤的保证修好，在家的保证把地种上。因此，民工情绪很高，创造了许多新的施工方法，产生了不少劳动模范，保证了修堤的按期完成，做到了修堤、生产两不误。
    但在工程施工中，还存在着重量不重质的严重缺点。如辽东省的北沙河筑堤工程，因为施工不按标准，原计划顶宽二公尺，坡度一比一点五，但筑成后顶宽不足二公尺，坡度仅一比一点二。同时填土太松，无法抵御洪水的冲击，以致在六月八日被冲破了两处缺口，淹地两万多亩。在灌溉工程上，也有施工草率不合标准的现象，如旧堤修补工程中，有的上下游高度宽度不一致。此种现象值得深切注意，应该加以严格检查。
