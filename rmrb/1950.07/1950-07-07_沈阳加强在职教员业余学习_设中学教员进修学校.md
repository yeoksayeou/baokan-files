　　Shenyang Strengthens On-the-Job Teachers' Spare-Time Study
    Establishes Secondary School Teachers' Continuing Education School

    [Our Newspaper Shenyang News] The Shenyang Municipal Education Bureau recently established a secondary school teachers' spare-time continuing education school to organize long-term, formal, planned, and systematic spare-time study for secondary school teachers throughout the city. The continuing education subjects include both common courses and specialized courses. Common courses include four items: basic theory of Marxism-Leninism, educational theory and policy, current political affairs, and ideological cultivation. The basic theory of Marxism-Leninism stipulates that the history of social development, political economy, and dialectical and historical materialism must be completed within two years. At present, teachers of political common sense, Chinese language, Russian language, physical education, music, art and other subjects in various schools are first studying political economy; teachers of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography and other subjects are first studying dialectical and historical materialism. The other three common courses will involve one or two reports and discussions each semester according to specific needs. Specialized courses mainly start from the difficult points in the textbooks of various subjects, learning professional theories and specialized knowledge. Lecturers of various subjects are respectively invited to be responsible comrades and experts from relevant departments; political economy will listen to the broadcast lectures of Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station. The school is headed by the director of the Shenyang Municipal Education Bureau, concurrently serving as the principal, and the head of the secondary education section concurrently serves as the director of academic affairs. There is also a school affairs committee, composed of responsible comrades of the Education Bureau and some secondary school principals. All secondary school teachers in the city participate in the study and are divided into classes according to the courses they teach. Members of the school affairs committee concurrently serve as class teachers for each class, and the heads of the city's subject teaching and research associations concurrently serve as study officers for each class. The study time is on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons every week. Examination and leave systems have also been formulated. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, the school officially started classes, first studying Chairman Mao's "Reform Our Study," the report on rectifying the style of study, and "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing" and other documents, in order to initially overcome the disconnection between theory and practice, subjectivism, and dogmatism in the teaching of various teachers, transform learning methods and ideological methods, and review teaching ideas in connection with reality, so as to lay the foundation for future learning that combines theory and practice.
