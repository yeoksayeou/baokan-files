	The rainfall in North China is generally concentrated in July and August (Gregorian calendar). From the beginning of the first ten days of summer to the last ten days, approximately a month, is the best season for afforestation. Especially after two thorough rains (or continuous rainy days). During this period, the temperature is high and the soil is sufficiently moist. Whether it is on thin, rocky mountains, sandy beaches, riverbank levees, or places far from water where it is difficult to plant trees in spring, planting (pine, cypress, elm, locust, poplar, jujube, etc.), layering (poplar, willow, reeds, etc., species with strong germination and vitality), root layering (black locust, jujube, ailanthus, elm, poplar, reeds, etc.), and sowing (oriental arborvitae, pine, fir, black locust, ailanthus, vitex, amorpha fruticosa, elm, willow, etc., species that germinate quickly, as well as hard-shelled species such as peach, apricot, and walnut) are all good methods.

	Here are a few experiences for planting:

	1.	The method of planting trees is generally the same as the method of planting trees in spring. However, attention must be paid to properly pruning the tree crown and tender shoots, and removing the upper redundant branches to prevent excessive evaporation of water and excessive consumption of nutrients, which will affect the survival of seedlings. Also, removing the leaves (referring to broad-leaved trees; even if not removed, they will fall off) can also achieve the aforementioned purpose and effect.

	2.	When transplanting tree seedlings or burying stems and layering, the soil must be compacted. The exposed part of the ground should be small during planting to avoid damage from wind, sun, etc.

	3.	Small seedlings are easier to survive. Buried stem planting is easier to succeed with robust branches grown within three to five years, because their tissue is complete, and they have strong germination ability, and can quickly take root and sprout. The growth force of overly thick poplar and willow stems is weak, and recovery is slow, so it is not suitable to use overly thick and old seedlings (saplings), and they should not be too long (a diameter of 0.5 to 1 inch and a length of 2 to 3 feet is most suitable).

	4.	The lower end of the sapling (poplar, willow buried stem, layering) should be cut into a sloping shape like a horse's ear to expand the water absorption surface, and it should be smooth to avoid damaging the bark.

	5.	Do not insert branches in long-term stagnant puddles during the rainy season to prevent the bark from rotting, which will affect germination.

	6.	When sowing for afforestation, whether strip sowing or spot sowing, the land must first be leveled and finely raked. After sowing the seeds, level the soil and gently press it firmly, then cover it with some weeds and leaves to prevent dryness and hinder germination.

	The sowing depth varies depending on the soil texture and the slope of the terrain. Sandy soil should be deep, clay soil should be shallow, steep slopes should be deep, and small slopes should be shallow. For small seeds, such as pine, fir, elm, ailanthus, poplar, and willow, the soil covering only needs to cover the seeds. For large seeds (hard-shelled seeds must wait until next spring to emerge), such as peach, apricot, chestnut, walnut, and acorns, the depth should be two to three times the diameter of the seed.

	Finally, in leadership, we should seize the rainy season. Because the rainfall time is uncertain, the working hours do not need to be too rigid, or mechanically stipulate assault weeks, assault ten-day periods, etc. We should seize the good opportunity of every first ten-day period of summer rain and make continuous assaults in order to expand afforestation achievements and ensure and improve the survival rate of trees.

　　雨季造林经验介绍
    本报通讯员  郭毅民
    华北雨量，历年规律多集中于七、八月（阳历）之间，由初伏到未伏，约一个月的时间内；特别在下过两次透雨后（连雨天更好）。是造林的最好季节。因这时期，气温高，地里水分足，不论在土薄多石的山岭、沙滩、河岸堤边及离水远，春季栽树难活的地方，采用栽植（松、柏、榆、槐、杨、枣树等）压枝（杨、柳、荻、苇等发芽力及生活力较强的树种）压根（洋槐、枣树、臭椿、榆、杨、荻、苇等）及播种（侧柏、松、杉、洋槐、臭椿、荆子、紫穗槐、榆、柳等发芽快的树种及桃、杏、核桃等硬壳树种）等办法，都是很好的时候。
    兹介绍种植时的几点经验：
    一、栽植树木的方法，一般与春季植树方法相同。惟必须注意适当修剪树冠嫩梢，去掉上部冗枝，以防水分过度蒸发和养分过度消耗，而影响树苗成活。再即摘掉树叶（指阔叶树；不摘掉亦必脱落）亦能收到前述的目的和效果。
    二、移植树秧或埋干、压条，都必须把土砸实。在栽植时地面露出部分要少，以免受风吹摇、日晒等害。
    三、苗木宜用小的，成活较易。埋干植树，以三、五年内生的粗壮枝条容易成活，因其组织完满，萌芽力强，能很快生根发芽。太粗的杨柳干生长力弱，恢复生长慢，故使用栽子（苗木）不用太粗老的，而且不宜太长（以直径五分至一寸，长度二、三尺最合适）。
    四、栽子的下端（杨、柳埋干、压枝）要削成斜面如马耳形，以扩大吸水面，并应平滑，不使树皮受损伤才好。
    五、雨季插枝不要在长期停水的洼地，以防树皮腐坏，影响发芽。
    六、播种造林时，不论条播和点播，须先将土地耧耙匀细，把种子播下，将土弄平轻压使实，然后再覆上一些杂草树叶，以防干燥，妨碍发芽。
    播种的深度，因土质粘松及地势斜度而不同。沙土应深，粘土要浅，坡度大的地方要深，小的地方要浅。小粒种子，如松、杉、榆、椿、杨、柳等覆土仅将种盖住即可，大粒种子（硬壳的须待明春出苗），如桃、杏、栗子、核桃、橡碗等，则须深于种子直径的二、三倍为宜。
    最后，在领导上应抓紧雨期，因降雨时间不定，工作时间，不必过于拘泥，或机械规定突击周、突击旬等，应掌握不错过一次伏雨的良机，连续突击，才能扩大植树成绩，保证并提高植树的成活率。
