　　Southwest Financial and Economic Situation Begins to Improve
　　Jiang Heng
   I. Serious Difficulties
　　Before liberation, the Southwest's financial and economic situation had already reached a dead end under the ravages, plunder, and destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Southwest's industry, commerce, and agriculture were all trending towards bankruptcy and collapse. In particular, the bankruptcy of the rural economy was even more severe. According to a 1947 survey, a middle peasant household in eastern Sichuan with 20 mu of land had to bear more than 13 shi, 7 dou, and 3 sheng of land tax and miscellaneous levies annually, accounting for one-third of their annual income. A tenant farmer with a family of four, renting 40 shi of grain land and 6 shi of vegetable plots, even in a bumper year, had a total annual production worth only 1,215,000 yuan in puppet currency. The cost of production (excluding labor) reached 700,000 yuan, while the rent amounted to 540,000 yuan, resulting in a debt of 25,000 yuan, not even counting the payment of exorbitant taxes. The lives of the peasants thus deteriorated day by day. In Bijie, Guizhou, the most impoverished area in the Southwest, there were many peasant households where the whole family shared one pair of trousers. As for the decline of industry and commerce, taking Chongqing as an example, according to a survey, 256 out of 345 factories were shut down before liberation; the number of employees decreased from 65,000 to 31,000. The "September 2nd" great fire in 1949 caused serious damage to the heart of Southwest industry and commerce. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 10,000 people died, 40 percent of warehouses were lost, and 22 percent of the textile industry was destroyed.
　　After liberation, due to the disruption and looting by tens of thousands of Kuomintang spies and bandits who had been planted in advance, transportation in the Southwest could not be quickly restored, thus hindering the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The recovery of the rural and urban economies was relatively difficult. In addition, the living expenses of 900,000 military, government, public, and education personnel who revolted, surrendered, were captured, or were retained at the time of liberation in the entire region placed a heavy burden on the Southwest's finances and economy, which was in a situation of severe difficulties. Taking public grain revenue as an example, eastern Sichuan, which collected the most, had only completed 49.2 percent by February. Northern Sichuan had only completed 10 percent by mid-March, and southern Sichuan had only completed 16 percent by the end of March. Among these, eastern Sichuan lost more than 25.89 million jin to bandits and spies before February; Suining Prefecture in northern Sichuan lost 1.2 million jin in March alone. Tax revenue was even lower. Kunming only collected the equivalent of 50,000 to 60,000 jin of rice per day in March; southern Sichuan only completed 5.7 percent in the first quarter. In total, the entire Southwest's tax revenue for the first quarter only accounted for 5 percent of the annual target. Such meager income seriously affected the Southwest's financial deficit, making it difficult to start restoring the social economy.
   II. Achievements after Unified Financial and Economic Work
　　Just when the Southwest was facing serious financial and economic difficulties, on March 3, the State Council of the Central People's Government made a historically significant decision to unify the nation's financial and economic work. This decision led the Southwest's financial and economic situation from severe difficulties to an initial improvement. First, income has greatly increased. As of mid-May, the entire region had completed 33.16 percent of the annual public grain target. Eastern Sichuan had also increased from 49.2 percent in February to 55 percent in mid-April. During the same period, salt tax completed 24.02 percent of the annual target. The increase in April compared to March was as follows: the former completed 60.79 percent of the month's target, while the latter only completed 51.6 percent of the month's target. Industrial and commercial tax completed 12.8 percent during the same period. April completed 33.24 percent of the month's target, and the first and middle ten days of May completed slightly less than 37 percent of the month's target. Northern Sichuan had also increased from 2.03 percent in March to 14.2 percent in April; southern Sichuan doubled in April compared to March; and Kunming increased more than threefold compared to March.
　　Secondly, expenditures have been greatly reduced. As of mid-May, nearly 150,000 personnel in the agencies and troops of the entire Southwest had been reduced after verification. Calculated at 400 jin of rice per person per month, monthly expenses could be reduced by 60 million jin. After preliminary reorganization and thrift measures, extravagance and waste in various departments have been greatly reduced. For example, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee's efforts to streamline logistical personnel and reduce the use of cars, water, and electricity can reduce expenditures by more than 20,000 jin of rice equivalent per month.
　　Thirdly, preliminary results have been achieved in clearing warehouses. The first phase of clearing by the Southwest Industry Department alone uncovered 21,000 tons of materials. The Ministry of Health cleared out a large quantity of Western medicine. The above two items are equivalent to more than 200 million jin of rice. In southern Sichuan, Luzhou County alone cleared out various materials worth 9.32 million jin of rice equivalent. Chengdu also cleared out a large quantity of materials worth more than 4.6 million jin of rice equivalent. This relatively increased income and can absolutely reduce expenditures.
　　The increase in income and the reduction in expenditures have opened up the road for the Southwest's financial and economic development. After financial stability and price stabilization, it is possible to vigorously support the gradual recovery of industry and commerce.
   III. A New Situation Emerges in Finance and Prices
　　Another aspect of the Southwest's financial and economic improvement is the trend towards financial stability and price stabilization. After rectifying revenue and expenditure, withdrawing currency, and managing cash, the Southwest's finance and prices presented a new situation: the phenomenon of inflation stopped, prices fell from skyrocketing levels, bank deposits greatly increased, and speculative hoarding merchants competed to sell off their inventories.
　　First, in terms of cash management, taking Chongqing as an example, in less than twenty days from late April to early May, 82 percent of the agencies and departments had opened accounts with the Chongqing branch of the People's Bank of China, and the ratio of cash to transfer payments had changed from 1:2.3 in March to 1:7.7. This allowed the currency to be controlled by the state bank and allocated in a planned manner.
　　Secondly, in terms of deposits, fixed-value deposits have been completely converted to cash deposits. The amount of deposits has greatly increased. Deposits in March were 131.6 billion yuan, which increased to 460.3 billion yuan by May 15, an increase of almost 3.5 times. The deposit balance of the Chongqing branch of the People's Bank of China doubled in April compared to March, quadrupled compared to February, and exceeded twice the amount of April by mid-May. As for deposits in private banks, they increased from 23.4 billion yuan at the end of April to 26.4 billion yuan on May 15. The proportion of private deposits in banks in various regions has gradually increased. Private deposits in the southern Sichuan branch increased from 40 percent in January to 45 percent in April.
　　Thirdly, the speed of currency circulation has slowed down, and the people's thinking of "valuing goods over money" has changed. The speed of currency circulation in Chongqing decreased by one-half in April compared to March. Merchants and farmers in various regions have changed the habit of "bartering," and the demand for RMB has increased, causing a shortage of currency in both urban and rural areas. This has created favorable conditions for expanding the scope of RMB circulation.
　　Once the currency stabilized, speculative merchants immediately sold off their hoarded goods. With the disappearance of false social purchasing power, prices fell again and again. The price index, which had skyrocketed to 405.23 in February (compared to 100 at the end of last December), fell to 330.5 in March and further to 261.2 in April. Although prices fell quickly, there were still few buyers. Therefore, at this critical juncture of financial and economic improvement, difficulties such as sluggish sales of goods, reduced production in industry and commerce, shutdowns, closures, and bankruptcies emerged, requiring the government and state-owned enterprises in the Southwest to adjust and support them.
   IV. Industry and Commerce Begin to Recover
　　After the price hikes during the Lunar New Year and the price declines in March, April, and May following the cessation of inflation, speculative and luxury private industry and commerce declined. Industry and commerce beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood also faced difficulties due to sluggish product sales and tight capital turnover. However, because the government's financial situation has greatly improved, it has the strength to invest in public enterprises and support private industry and commerce, enabling public and private enterprises that were only half a year after liberation to begin to recover. In five months, the government invested 23 million jin of grain and more than 45 billion yuan in public enterprises, enabling 11 of the 88 public factories that had been severely damaged or destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries to be temporarily maintained, 16 to partially resume work, and 40 to largely resume work. Electricity and steel have also gradually recovered. Before liberation, the Southwest's power generation capacity was approximately 71,734 kilowatts, of which 20,850 kilowatts were destroyed, accounting for more than 34 percent of the total power. Now, in addition to repairs, it has exceeded the total power before liberation by 6,150 kilowatts. Even the 29th Factory and Chongqing Power Company, which were the most severely damaged, have also resumed work one after another. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of the Southwest have longed for for 40 years, has also begun construction. Steel rails and other materials for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are being manufactured in Chongqing's steel industry.
　　As for supporting private industry and commerce, it is being carried out through commissioned processing, product acquisition, and ordering. The Southwest Trade Department has invested 431.788 billion yuan in cash, and professional companies in various regions have assisted more than 400 large and small private factories and workshops through purchasing and sales relationships. At the same time, private industry and commerce are being helped to maintain production and conduct transportation and sales, and invigorate the market by reducing loan interest rates, freight rates, and electricity and coal prices. In Chengdu, 270,000 jin of raw cotton were supplied to spinning mills, 1.8 billion yuan in bank loans were provided, 5.7 billion yuan in orders were placed by the Finance Department and the Logistics Department, and 9.5 billion yuan was invested in product acquisition, solving some of the difficulties of some private industry and commerce. In Chongqing, the Southwest Industry Department placed orders worth 10.4 billion yuan to purchase coal, supporting the resumption of work of 11 private coal mines. In May, it allocated 521 tons of goods to private steel factories such as Yuxin, enabling the industry to fully or partially resume work. The Southwest Trade Department signed contracts with private shipping companies to store 16,000 tons of coal needed during the flood season. Various professional companies invested 128.4 billion yuan in cash to purchase cotton yarn, bristles, tung oil, and other materials from various private manufacturers, enabling more than 80 bristle factories, exporters, and others that had been completely shut down before liberation to resume operations. More than 40 rice mills were commissioned to process rice, allocating more than 78,000 shi of rice for processing; more than 10 yarn mills were commissioned to process 43,400 dan of cotton, enabling more than 90 percent of the spindles to continue production. The private industry and commerce of the Southwest is gradually recovering under the support of the government and state-owned enterprise departments.
　　Now, the Southwest People's Government is also vigorously adjusting industry and commerce, adjusting public-private relations and labor-management relations. Through the efforts of private industry and commerce itself to reform and improve management, it will surely overcome the temporary difficulties in the process of improvement and turn to a bright future of normal development.

### 西南财政经济开始好转

　　西南财政经济开始好转
    江横
   一、严重的困难
    西南的财政经济，解放以前，在蒋介石匪帮的摧残掠夺破坏下，原已陷入了山穷水尽的境地。西南的工、商、农业都已经趋于破产和崩溃。特别是农村经济的破产更为严重。据一九四七年的调查，川东一个具有二十亩土地的中等农户，一年中所负担的田粮杂税即达十三石七斗三升以上，占全年收入的三分之一。一个四口之家的佃农，租种四十石谷和六石土的田庄，即使在丰收的年份，全年总生产量只折合伪法币一百二十一万五千元，所费生产成本（劳力不计）即达七十万元，而租谷却折合了五十四万元，因而即须负债二万五千元，尚不算缴纳苛捐杂税在内。农民的生活就这样地日益恶化了。在全西南最贫瘠的贵州毕节一带，就有一家轮穿一条裤子的农户很多。至于工商业的凋敝，以重庆为例，据调查，解放以前，三百四十五家工厂中，即有二百五十六家停工歇业；职工人数则由六万五千人减少到三万一千人。一九四九年的“九二”大火灾，更给予了这个西南工商业的心脏以严重损失。据不完全统计，死亡了近万人，仓库损失了百分之四十，纺织业损失了百分之二十二。
    在解放以后，由于蒋匪预先埋伏的数十万特务土匪的扰乱和抢掠，使西南交通未能迅速恢复，因而城乡物资交流仍被阻塞，农村和城市经济的恢复较为困难，加上全区九十万解放时起义、投诚、俘虏和留用的军、政、公教人员的生活负担，西南的财政经济是处在重重的困难情况之中。以公粮收入而论，征收最多的川东，至二月时也只完成了百分之四九·二，川北到三月中旬只完成百分之十，川南到三月底只完成百分之十六。其中被土匪特务劫走的，川东在二月份以前就损失了二千五百八十九万余斤；川北遂宁专区在三月份即被劫一百二十万斤。捐税收入则是更少，昆明市三月份每日只收折米五、六万斤；川南第一季度只完成了百分之五·七。总计全西南第一季度的税收，只完成了全年的百分之五。这样微少的收入，就更严重地影响了西南财政的入不敷出，着手恢复社会经济也就很感困难了。
    二、统一财经后的成绩
    正在西南处于财政经济重重困难的时候，三月三日，中央人民政府政务院作出了具有历史意义的统一国家财经工作的决定。这一个决定，使西南财政经济由严重的困难引向了开始好转。首先在收入方面已大有增加。公粮截至五月中旬止，全区即完成了全年的百分之三三·一六。川东亦已由二月份的百分之四九·二增加到四月中旬的百分之五五。盐税在同时期中完成了全年的百分之二四·○二，四月份比三月份增加的情形是：前者完成该月百分之六○·七九，而后者仅完成该月的百分之五一·六；工商税在同时期中完成了百分之一二·八，四月份是完成了该月的百分之三三·二四，五月上、中两旬即完成了该月的百分之三七弱；而川北亦已由三月份的百分之二·○三增加到四月份的百分之一四·二；川南四月份比三月份增加了一倍；昆明市比三月份时增加到三倍多。
    其次在支出方面已大大节省。全西南的机关部队人员，截至五月中旬，经过核实已减少了近十五万人，以每人每月四百斤米计算，每月即可节省开支六千万斤。而各部门的铺张浪费，经过初步整编节约，已大大减少。如贵州省委机关精简勤杂人员和汽车、节约水电数项，每月即可减少支出折米两万多斤。
    第三是清理仓库已有初步成绩。仅西南工业部第一期清理，即查出物资两万一千吨，卫生部清出了大批的西药，以上两项即折米达两亿余斤。而在川南仅泸县一县，已清出各项物资折米值九百三十二万斤。成都市亦清出了折米值四千六百多斤的大批物资。这是相对的增加了收入，而可以绝对的减少了支出。
    收入的增加，支出的减少，就使西南财政经济打开了前进的道路；而在金融物价稳定后，有可能大力扶植工商业趋向于逐步的恢复。
    三、金融物价出现了新局面
    西南财政经济开始好转的另一方面，则是金融物价趋向稳定。经过整顿收支，回笼货币，管理现金后，西南的金融物价即呈现了一个新的局面，即通货膨胀的现象停止了，物价由暴涨而下落了，银行的存款是大大地增加了，投机囤积的商户竞相抛售存货了。
    首先在现金管理上，以重庆为例，人民银行重庆分行从四月下旬到五月上旬不到二十天中，各机关部门的开户，已占百分之八十二，而现金和转账的比例已经由三月份的一比二·三变为一比七·七。这就使通货能掌握在国家银行的手中，而可以有计划地调拨了。
    其次在存款方面，折实存款已完全改为现金存款。而存款金额却是大大增加。三月份存款是一、三一六亿，至五月十五日已增加到四、六○三亿，几乎增加了三·五倍。人民银行重庆分行的存款余额，四月份比三月份增加了一倍，比二月份则增加了四倍，而五月中旬则又超过了四月份的二倍。至于私营行庄的存款，亦已由四月底的二百三十四亿元，增加到五月十五日的二百六十四亿元。各地银行的存款中，私人的比例已逐渐增大。川南分行私人存款，已由一月份的百分之四十，增加到四月份的百分之四十五。
    再次是货币的流转速度降低，而人民中间的“重货轻币”思想已经转变。重庆的货币流转速度，四月份已比三月份减低二分之一，各地商人和农民已改变了“物物交换”的习惯，人民币的需要量因增加而使城乡均发生了筹码不足的现象。这就使人民币扩大流通范围有了有利的条件。
    通货一经稳定，投机商人立即抛售囤积的货物，加上社会虚假购买力的消失，物价因而就一落再落，原来二月份物价已暴涨至四○五·二三（去年十二月底为一○○），三月份即下落至三三○·五，四月份更下落至二六一·二。物价下落虽快，但购买者还是很少，因而在这财政经济开始好转的关头，却出现了货物滞销，工商业减产、停工、歇业和倒闭的困难情况，需要西南的政府和国营企业加以调整和扶植了。
    四、工商业开始恢复
    西南的工商业经过了年关的物价昂涨，又经过了通货膨胀停止后三、四、五三个月物价的下落，投机和奢侈品的私营工商业衰落了，有利于国计民生的工商业也因产品滞销、资金周转不灵而困难起来了。但是，政府因为财政收支的情况已经大大改变，已有力量对公营企业的投资和对私营工商业的扶植，而使解放才告半年的公私营企业正在开始恢复。政府在五个月中，对公营企业的投资，粮食达二千三百万斤，人民币达四百五十多亿，因而使惨遭国民党反动派破坏或摧残的八十八家公营工厂，有十一家暂行维持，十六家部分开工，四十家大部开工。电力和钢铁亦已逐渐恢复。解放前，西南发电量原约七一、七三四启罗瓦特，被破坏了即达二○、八五○启罗瓦特，占总电力的百分之三十四强，现除修复外，尚超过解放前总电力达六、一五○启罗瓦特。就是被破坏最厉害的二十九厂和重庆电力公司也都先后开工了。西南人民渴望了四十年的成渝铁路，也已经开始动工。建筑成渝铁路的钢轨等器材，就在重庆的钢铁工业中制造着。
    至于对私营工商业的扶植，则是通过了委托加工，收购产品，订货等方式进行的。西南贸易部投放了现金即达四千三百十七亿八千余万元，各地专业公司经过购销关系，就扶助了大小私营工厂、作坊达四百余家。同时以减低贷款利率、客货运价、电力和煤炭价格等帮助私营工商业维持生产和进行运销，活泼市场。在成都，供给纱厂原棉二十七万斤，银行贷款十八亿元，财政处和后勤部的订货五十七亿元，收购产品投放九十五亿元，解决了一部分私营工商业的部分困难。在重庆，西南工业部以订货付款办法，付出一百零四亿元订购煤炭，扶助了十一家私营煤矿的复工。五月份又给私营渝鑫等钢铁工厂配货五百二十一吨，使该业全部复工或部分复工。西南贸易部则以签订垫款合同的办法，给各私营轮船公司储存了洪水期所需煤炭一万六千吨。各专业公司又投放现金一千二百八十四亿元收购了各私营厂商的棉纱、猪鬃、桐油等物资，使解放前即已全部停业的洗鬃厂、出口商等恢复了八十余家。委托加工的米厂四十多家，拨给加工米七万八千余石；纱厂十余家，加工棉四万三千四百余担，使百分之九十以上的纱锭继续着生产。西南的私营工商业就在政府和国营企业部门的扶植下，逐渐地恢复了。
    现在，西南人民政府还在大力调整工商业，调整公私关系和劳资关系，经过私营工商业本身的努力改革和改善经营，定能克服好转中的暂时困难，转到正常发展的光明前途。
