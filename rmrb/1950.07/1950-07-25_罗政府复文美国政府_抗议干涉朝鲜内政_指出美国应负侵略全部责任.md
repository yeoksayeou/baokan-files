Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Romanian News Agency, July 21st, news, The Government of the Romanian People's Republic has sent a reply to the US Government regarding the US Government's statement on the naval blockade of the Korean coast. The reply is as follows:

"The Government of the Romanian People's Republic believes that the US President's order to send naval, air, and land forces to interfere in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as the dispatch of naval forces to blockade the Korean coast, is a direct act of aggression by the United States against the Korean people.

The Security Council resolution proposed by the United States is illegal because this resolution was passed by the Security Council under pressure from the US government and without the participation of the two permanent members, the Soviet Union and China. The Soviet Union and China have already declared their disapproval of this act of undermining the United Nations Charter.

The Security Council's illegal resolution is a direct interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people and a blatant violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.

The Government of the Romanian People's Republic, adhering to the cause of peace, adhering to the principles of independence of all nations and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, believes that the US aggression against the Korean people is a serious act of undermining world peace and should bear full responsibility for this aggression."

　　罗政府复文美国政府
    抗议干涉朝鲜内政
    指出美国应负侵略全部责任
    【新华社二十一日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社二十一日讯，罗马尼亚人民共和国政府顷致美国政府复文一件，答复美国政府关于海军封锁朝鲜海岸的声明，该复文如下：
    “罗马尼亚人民共和国政府认为：美国总统下令派遣海、空、陆军干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及派遣海军封锁朝鲜海岸的干涉行为，乃是美国对朝鲜人民的直接侵略。
    美国所提出的安全理事会的决议案是非法的，因为这一决议案是安理会在美国政府的压力下，在苏联与中国两常任理事国没有参加的情况下通过的。苏联与中国业已声明不赞同这一破坏联合国宪章的行为。
    安理会的非法决议，乃是直接干涉朝鲜人民的内政，明目张胆地破坏联合国宪章的基本原则。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府信守和平事业，信守各民族独立和不干涉他国内政的原则，认为美国对朝鲜人民的侵略，乃是严重破坏世界和平的行为，并应对这一侵略负全部责任。”
