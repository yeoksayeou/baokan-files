    State Support for Private Industry
    Commissioned processing and orders increase substantially, helping private industry overcome difficulties and improve operations.
    [This newspaper dispatch] Reporter Zeng Wenjing reports: In the past six months, the state has substantially increased commissioned processing and orders for private industry, playing a significant role in helping private industry overcome difficulties. At the same time, the state is also guiding private industry to improve production efficiency and reduce costs by improving management and concentrating capital. Many factories have already achieved surpluses.
    In the total value of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government's first 720,000 tons of millet orders this spring, in Shanghai alone, private steel orders accounted for 2,881,960 converted units; private motor orders accounted for 4,172,126 jin of white glutinous rice. The National Machine Industry Conference in May distributed a large number of orders to private factories; order contracts are being signed one after another.
    The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company plans to commission private factories to spin and weave monthly quantities from June to October, which can enable private factories to operate 81 percent of the total number of spindles (excluding the Northeast). Other industries such as grain, coal mines, cement, and egg products also have large-scale orders, processing, and sales packages.
    At the same time, the amount of this processing and ordering is progressing rapidly. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company received 7,321 pieces of cotton yarn and 130,061 bolts of cotton cloth in February; in May, cotton yarn increased to 21,455 pieces, and cotton cloth to 498,513 bolts. After June, the monthly yarn spinning will reach 58,524 pieces. From the time of liberation to March of this year, the East China Branch of the China National Department Store placed orders and commissioned processing to private factories for only 7.4 billion yuan, which suddenly increased to more than 88 billion yuan in April.
    Through state commissioned processing, ordering, and purchasing, private industries that were in difficulty in February and March of this year, which are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, have been able to maintain and recover. For example, the production capacity of private industries in Shenyang is currently operating at full capacity. In Shanghai, the textile center, the number of spindles in operation has increased from 49.6 percent in February to 90 percent in June.
    As for those private factories that have been processing for state-owned enterprises for a long time, they can still obtain normal profits and have made some development even in the case of the general depression in other industries. For example, private flour mills in Tianjin generally have a profit of four jin of wheat for every 100 jin of wheat processed. From September of last year to May of this year, private flour mills in the city earned a total of 3.7 billion yuan in processing fees; the number of steel grinders increased from 141 to 191. Private yarn factories in Tianjin, Tangshan, and Shijiazhuang are all making money. Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Huaxin, the three major yarn factories, generally distributed full-year dividends last year and added spinning and weaving equipment.
    In the process of state-commissioned processing and ordering, not only has the restoration and development of private industry been supported, but also the improvement of internal management and the union of enterprise organizations in private industry has been promoted. For example, after the East China Industrial Department placed orders with private motor factories, the factories conveniently formed a joint production organization, and cooperated with each other in the division of labor on equipment, so that factories with poorer equipment and no ability to undertake production could also manufacture parts and maintain production. At the same time, the department also sent a special inspection team to conduct technical inspections of the factories and provide necessary assistance in technology. This can not only ensure the improvement of quality, but also reduce waste in production. Also, when the department placed orders with private steel rolling mills, it actively helped the factories to carry out fixed-time, fixed-quantity, and fixed-quality work to improve production efficiency. For example, the towel, blanket, bleaching and printing, dyeing, shipping, and construction industries in Shanghai have implemented joint operations on a voluntary basis, unified acceptance of orders, and then allocated to each factory according to the proportion, public and private signed contracts, determined a unified delivery date, and unified quality specifications, so that the factories have a certain basis for ensuring credit and improving quality. In particular, the condition of using medium technical standards as a condition for commissioned processing has further promoted private factories to work hard to reform business methods to reduce costs. In this way, some private factories have been able to support themselves, and some have already made a profit.
    However, it cannot be ignored that some industrialists and businessmen have not yet changed their old ideas and styles, and do not pay attention to self-reliance and hard work to change their business methods, but instead put forward excessive and unreasonable demands to the government, or simply rely on state-commissioned processing, ordering, and purchasing to "benefit themselves," and some are even eyeing the market gaps, attempting to speculate and seek illegal profits. All of these should be corrected. Otherwise, they will only go to a dead end and hinder the recovery and development of the social economy.

　　国家扶植私营工业
    委托加工、订货大量增加，帮助私营工业度过难关，改善经营。
    【本报讯】记者曾文经报道：半年来国家对私营工业的委托加工和订货大量增加，对私营工业度过难关，起了很大的作用。同时国家也引导私营工业从改善管理，集中资力等方面来提高生产效率，减低成本。不少厂家已有了盈余。
    中央人民政府重工业部今春第一次七十二万吨小米订货总值中，仅上海一市，私营钢铁订货即占二、八八一、九六○个折实单位；私营电机订货占四、一七二、一二六斤中白粳米。五月全国机器工业会议分配给私营工厂大批订货；订货合同已在陆续签订中。
    中国花纱布公司六月至十月计划每月委托私营工厂代纺代织的数量，可使私营工厂能运转纱锭总数的百分之八十一（东北在外）。其他如粮食、煤矿、洋灰、蛋品等业也都有大规模的订货、加工和包销。
    同时，这种加工订货的数额，进展是迅速的。中国花纱布公司二月份收入代纺棉纱七、三二一件，代织棉布一三○、○六一匹；五月份收入棉纱增至二一、四五五件，棉布四九八、五一三匹。六月份以后，每月代纺纱又将达到五八、五二四件。中国百货公司华东区公司从解放后至今年三月，向私营工厂订货及委托加工，为数仅七十四亿元，四月份即突增至八百八十余亿元。
    经过国家的委托加工、订货和收购，在今年二三月间陷入困难的有利于国计民生的私营工业，都得以维持和恢复。如沈阳市的私营工业，目前生产能力已发挥到了饱和点。纺织中心的上海市，开动纱锭已由二月份的百分之四九、六，增加到了六月份的百分之九十。
    至于那些长期给国营企业加工的私营工厂，甚至在其他行业普遍萧条的情况下，仍然能得到正常的利润，并且有了若干发展。如天津私营面粉厂在加工中，每百斤小麦一般有四斤小麦的利润。从去年九月至今年五月，该市私营面粉厂共赚加工费三十七亿元；钢磨由一四一部增至一九一部。天津、唐山、石家庄的私营纱厂家家赚钱。恒源、北洋、华新三大纱厂普遍提发去年全年股息，并添加纺锭、织机等设备。
    在国家委托加工和订货过程中，不仅扶植了私营工业的恢复和发展，而且也促进了私营工业内部管理的改善和企业组织的联合。如华东区工业部向私营电机厂订货后，各厂厂方便成立联合生产组织，在设备上互相分工配合，使原来设备较差和没有承造能力的工厂，也可以制造零件，维持生产。同时该部还派遣专门检查小组，到各厂进行技术检查，并在技术上予以必要的协助。这样既可保证质量的提高，又可减少生产上的浪费。又该部在向私营轧钢厂订货时，曾积极帮助各厂进行定时、定量、定质工作，来提高生产效率。又如上海的毛巾、被毯、漂印、炼染、航运、营造等业，在自愿基础上实行联营，统一承接订货，再按比例分配给各厂家，公私签定合同，确定统一交货日期，划一质量规格，使各工厂在确保信用，提高质量上有了一定的依据。特别是以中等技术标准作委托加工的条件，更促使私营工厂努力改革经营方法，以减低成本。这样各私营工厂有的已保本自给，有的已有盈余。
    但是，不可忽视的，某些工商业者还没有转变旧的思想和作风，还不注意自力更生，努力改便经营方法，而是向政府提出过高和不合理的要求，或者单纯依靠国家的委托加工、订货、收购来“利私”，有的更是瞅着市场的空隙，企图投机取巧，以谋取非法的暴利。这些都是应该改正的。否则是只有自己走入绝路，并妨碍社会经济的恢复和发展。
