Introducing Cooperative Afforestation in Various Parts of North China
　　Huang Shu　Tong Xinfu

　　In recent years, many cooperative mutual aid organizations have emerged in the afforestation movement in North China. In ways such as several households, one village, or several villages, and public-private cooperation, according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, they jointly afforest by providing seedlings if they have them, labor if they have it, money if they have it, and land if they have it, calculating shares at equivalent value and distributing dividends according to shares. This has solved many difficulties in afforestation and forest protection, and has driven a mass afforestation movement. This is a work that should be vigorously promoted in sandy and mountainous afforestation areas with a good foundation of mass work, and it is also the main direction for the future development of afforestation. Several typical examples are introduced here for reference.

A. Types of Cooperative Afforestation

(1) Daying Area Windbreak Cooperative

　　Daying in Fanshi County, Shanxi Province, is the source of the Hutuo River. The terrain is high and cold, and the wind is strong. There has been a saying since ancient times that "Daying is the general wind tunnel of the thirteen provinces of the world." Since the Japanese invaders invaded and washed away the trees, sandstorms have attacked Daying all year round, making the cultivated land of the original "rice and grain river" worse and worse. The masses urgently demanded afforestation to prevent wind and sand. However, very few people had tree seedlings, and it was impossible to protect the few trees planted privately. After the land reform, the land was relatively scattered, and to build larger windbreak forest belts, more cooperation was needed.

　　In the spring of 1947, the Forestry Group of the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Agricultural and Forestry Department helped the four villages of Daying, Shuimo, Zuosuo, and Xiaodian, and Daying High School, to jointly organize a windbreak forest cooperative, and also organized a joint village cooperative between the two villages of Jinshanpu and Nanhe. Then Jianyu, Beihe, and Jiaohui, three villages of Haojiawan, also established a cooperative each. Afforestation was carried out with a village, a school, and a household as a unit to buy shares. At the beginning, when organizing the two joint village cooperatives of Daying and Jinshanpu, due to the lack of experience in organizing cooperative afforestation, the cadres were eager for quick success and arbitrarily formulated the cooperative's charter based on subjective requirements, forcing villages several miles apart to afforest together. As a result, the members were not very concerned and the results were not great. Among them, the two-village joint cooperative of Jinshanpu was more sound than the four-village joint cooperative of Daying. Afterwards, after accepting preliminary experience, when organizing the three cooperatives of Jianyu, etc., we consulted with the masses in the form of old farmers' forums, and organized cooperative afforestation according to the actual situation and the requirements of the masses. In this way, the trees were planted better, with a survival rate of 65% to 85%, and special personnel were selected to lead the forest protection, which was well protected. In the second spring, the Jianyu Cooperative also collected the willow branches that had not survived on the forest land and exchanged them for 1,000 new tree seedlings. The Haojiawan and Beihe Jiaohui cooperatives also expanded afforestation by more than 10,000 trees in the second year, and the members were in high spirits.

　　In 1948, cooperative afforestation in the villages near Daying was further developed. In addition to the expansion of afforestation by the original five cooperatives, five more cooperatives were organized. More than 40,000 trees were planted in the spring. In the autumn, with the afforestation cooperative as the mainstay, Fanshi County planted a total of more than 93,000 poplar and willow trees and sowed more than 13,000 fruit kernels such as walnuts, peaches, and apricots throughout the county. The organization and share calculation methods of each cooperative were also simplified according to the opinions of the masses: Labor shares were sometimes based on one share for each day of work, and sometimes based on a certain number of trees planted. All were based on household units to buy shares. Each cooperative selected special personnel to lead afforestation and forest protection, and selected moist wastelands, using willow or small-leaved poplar layering and cuttings to create large, dense mother tree forests, preparing to develop windbreak forest belts.

(2) Shuhui in Zhao Lanzhuang, Jin County

　　Zhao Lanzhuang has a lot of sandy land, accounting for 40% of the cultivated land. After all the trees were cut down by the Japanese invaders, a large white sand area remained in the northwest of the village. The wind and sand blew to the good land in the south of the village, and the life in the village became worse year by year. After liberation in 1943, activist Zheng Luoxi organized five neighboring households to plant one qing of willow branches to prevent wind and sand. The five households provided tree seedlings and labor equally. The wasteland of the five households was not enough, and a little of someone else's land was used, and it was agreed that the land contributors would occupy half of the shares, and the labor and tree seedling contributors would occupy half of the shares together. In the past five years, the whole village has been led to organize seventeen tree associations. 60% of the 526 households in the village have joined the association, and the other households have also planted trees themselves. The smallest tree association has three households, and the largest has twenty-four households, led by the chairman. The large associations are also divided into groups according to land neighbors, led by the "managers". In the past five years, the whole village has afforested sixteen qing, and has also produced more than 7,000 willow branches and harvested a lot of willow strips.

(3) Ma Laoqi's incidental tree planting

　　In Diantunying, Ningjin, there is an old man named Ma Laoqi. His family farms sandy land and his life is not strong, but he has the technology of growing fruit trees and willow branches. Every year he persuades people everywhere to plant trees together. The land contributor occupies 50% of the shares, and the tree seedling (mostly fruit seedlings) contributor occupies 25% of the shares. He contributes labor and is responsible for repairs, and also occupies 25% of the shares. Everyone is willing to buy shares. In the past eight years, he has partnered with others in twenty-five groups, planting more than one qing of trees. After the trees grew up, the life of the family of five became stronger day by day. Although he is a military属, he has never asked the village to help cultivate. In 1948, under the call of the Jizhong Afforestation Team, he organized sixteen people to plant more than 700 trees, leading the whole village to plant more than 10,000 trees. The two qing of sandy wasteland in the village have been eliminated.

(4) The First Cooperative Forest Farm of the Old Ci River in Jixi

　　The western section of the old Ci River sandy wasteland in Zhengding County, along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, from Xidu Village, Xibaizhuang to Xin'an, is about four li long from north to south and about three and a half li long from east to west, a total area of 3,416 mu of sandy wasteland. Flying sand covers good farmland every year, and sometimes even buries the railway tracks of this section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. During the puppet regime period, attempts were also made to plant sand-fixing forests in this area, but they failed. Since the land reform, the masses in this area have urgently demanded the elimination of sandy wasteland. Governments at all levels also attach great importance to this matter. However, in this area, due to the issue of land rights and tree rights, contradictions often occur between villages, which hinders the work of afforestation and desertification control. After on-the-spot investigation by the Jixi Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau, the contradictions between the villages were gradually resolved. Through the masses, the ownership of this piece of land with unclear land rights and the remaining security forests built by the enemy and puppets were taken into public ownership, and the First Cooperative Forest Farm of the Old Ci River was established. The forest land was divided into three pieces, and each village organized an afforestation cooperative to plant trees separately. The three cooperatives signed organizational regulations with the Afforestation Bureau, and democratically elected persons in charge. Two members were selected from the forest protection committee of each village to be responsible for the joint village forest protection work. It was determined that the Afforestation Bureau would provide tree seedlings, and the afforestation cooperatives of each village would mobilize labor to buy shares. Farmers in each village could freely buy shares and participate in the afforestation cooperative of their village. The method of calculating shares was to calculate work and calculate shares. After democratic evaluation, the labor force was recorded and calculated as shares. This aroused the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation. For example, old farmer Wen Luorang from Xin'an Village said: "If it weren't for the Afforestation Bureau, where would we get tree seedlings?" After the meetings in each village, children and women also participated in the autumn afforestation.

　　In 1949, the Jixi Shahe Wasteland Afforestation Bureau, in conjunction with the local government, organized various types of afforestation cooperatives in the sandy wasteland area according to the conditions of each village and the requirements of the masses, clearly stipulated the rights and interests of collective afforestation, and combined it with the vital interests of the farmers, so that everyone actively participated. Also, because of the in-depth and specific leadership of professional cadres, the afforestation technology was improved, creating larger and more effective windbreak forest belts and forest networks. This made sandy wasteland afforestation a planned, organized, and technical mass movement, and it has made significant progress season after season. Most villages have learned the key points of dense planting, shallow exposure and deep burial, and tight compaction, and press poplar and willow strips in dry sandy land, and use the bow-shaped layering method. The row spacing in each key village has been reduced from the habitual one zhang to a more reasonable three to five chi. Therefore, the average survival rate in spring reached 81%, and the rainy season further increased to 90%.

B. The Benefits of Cooperative Afforestation

　　Sound mass afforestation cooperatives are all combined according to the principles of voluntariness, equivalent value, and mutual benefit. It has the following advantages:

　　(1) Mutual assistance and cooperation solve the difficulties of private individuals who cannot afforest due to lack of tree seedlings, technology, labor, and land.

　　(2) It closely combines collective afforestation with private interests. Everyone feels that they have a share and are planting trees for themselves, so they plant them well.

　　(3) With organization and leadership, management is good, and forest protection is not a problem.

　　(4) The rights and interests are determined, and the dividends are distributed according to the shares after income; it will not lead to disputes over tree rights and land rights like in past collective afforestation.

　　(5) With fixed organizations, the cause is constantly expanding, and long-term planned afforestation is carried out.

　　(6) On wind-prone land where land rights are scattered, larger protective forest belts can be built together.

　　(7) For areas lacking tree seedlings, the government can invest in or lend tree seedlings to afforestation cooperatives in cash. And the tree seedlings that should be distributed can be used to help other villages afforest.

　　(8) On the basis of organization, the creativity of the masses can be brought into play, which is conducive to improving technology.

　　介绍华北各地的合作造林
    黄舒　佟新夫
    近年在华北的造林运动中出现了好些合作互助的组织。由群众数户、一村或数村及公私合作等方式，按照自愿两利的原则，用有苗出苗、有力出力、有钱出钱、有地出地、等价算股、按股分红的办法共同造林。解决了造林与护林上的许多困难，并带动了群众性的造林运动。这是目前在群众工作基础较好的沙荒和山荒造林地区急应大力推广的工作，也是今后发展造林的主要方向。兹介绍几个典型例子，以供参考。
    甲、合作造林的类型
    （一）大营一带防风林合作社
    山西繁峙县大营一带是滹沱河的发源地。地势高寒，风势猛烈。自古有“天下十三省，大营总风筒”的传说。自日寇侵入，洗伐树木，风沙终年向大营一带猛袭，使原来“米粮川”的耕地，愈来愈坏。群众迫切要求造林防风沙。但是有树秧的很少，私人栽上几棵又没法保护。在土改后土地比较分散，要造较大的防风林带，更需要合作。
    一九四七年春，前晋察冀边区农林处林业组，帮助大营、水磨、左所、小店四村和大营高小，共同组织一个防风林合作社，并组织金山铺与南河交会两村的联村社。接着涧峪北河交会郝家湾三村也各成立了一社。以一村一校及一户为单位入股造林。开始在组织大营和金山铺两个联村社时，由于缺乏组织合作造林的经验，干部好大喜功，先凭主观要求拟定合作社章程，把相距好几里的村子硬凑到一块造林。结果社员不很关心，成绩不大。其中金山铺的两村联社比大营四村联社较为健全。其后接受了初步经验，在组织涧峪等三社时，我们利用老农座谈会的方式，跟群众商量，根据实际情况和群众要求来组织合作造林。这样树就栽的更好，活了六成五到八成五，并且选出专人领导护林，保护周到。涧峪社到了第二年春天还将林地上没栽活的柳杆子收起来，换了一千根新树秧子。郝家湾、北河交会两社，第二年也扩大造林一万余株，社员情绪很高。
    四八年大营附近各村合作造林，更进一步发展。除掉原有五社扩大造林外，又组织了五个社。春季共造林四万多株。秋季繁峙以造林合作社为主，全县共栽杨柳九万三千余株，播种核桃、桃、杏等果核一万三千余株。各社的组织与算股方法也根据群众的意见而简单化：劳力股有的每出一个工就入一股，有的按栽树的一定数目入股。都是以户为单位入股。各社选出专人领导造林与护林，选择湿润荒滩，用柳树或小叶杨压条与插枝，造成大块的稠密的母树林，准备发展防风林带。
   （二）晋县赵兰庄的树会
    赵兰庄沙地很多，占了耕地的四成。所有树木被日寇砍光后，村西北剩下一片大白沙。风沙刮到村南好地里，村里生活一年不如一年。一九四三年解放后，积极分子郑洛喜组织五户地邻栽了一顷柳杆子，防风防沙。五户平均出树秧出工。五户的荒地不够，用了别人一点，商定出地的占半股，出劳力树秧的合占半股。五年来带动全村组织了十七个树会。全村五百二十六户有六成入了会，其它的户也自己栽起树来。最小的树会有三户，大的二十四户，有会长领导。大的会还按地邻分小组，由“管事”领导。五年内全村造林十六顷，还出产柳杆子七千多根，割柳条很多。
   （三）马老齐的捎种树
    宁晋佃户营有个马老齐，家里种的沙地，生活不强，但有养果树和柳杆子的技术，每年到处劝人合伙栽树。出地的占五成股，出树秧（果苗居多）的占二成半股。他出工和负责修理，也占二成半股。大家都愿意入股。八年来跟别人结了二十五伙，栽树一顷多。树长起来后，全家五口人的生活一天比一天强。他虽是军属，从没有向村里要求代耕。四八年在冀中造林队的号召下，他组织了十六个人栽树七百多株，带动全村造林一万多株。村里的两顷沙荒都消灭了。
   （四）冀西老磁河的第一合作林场
    正定县老磁河沙荒西段，沿京汉铁路，从西杜村、西白庄到辛安，南北长约四里，东西长约三里半，总面积三千四百一十六亩的一片沙荒地区，飞沙每年掩盖良田，有时竟把这段京汉铁路路轨都掩埋上。敌伪时期在这地区也试栽防沙林，结果失败。自土改后，这个地区群众迫切要求消灭沙荒。各级政府也十分重视这件事。但在这地区，由于地权及树权的问题，村与村之间常发生矛盾，致使造林灭荒工作受了阻碍。冀西沙荒造林局经过实地的调查，逐步解决了村与村之间的矛盾，通过群众把这片地权不明的、敌伪营造之残存保安林收归公有，成立老磁河第一合作林场。将林地划分三片，由三村每村组织一个造林合作社，分别造林，并由三社与造林局订立组织条例，民主选举负责人。由各村护林委员会委员中选出二人担任联村护林工作。确定由造林局出树苗，各村造林合作社发动劳力入股，各村农民可自由入股。参加本村造林合作社，算股办法为计工算股，经民主评定劳动力，记账算股。这样掀起了群众造林的积极性。如辛安村老农文洛让说：“要不是造林局，咱们那儿弄树秧去。”各村开过会后，儿童妇女也都参加了秋后造林。
    一九四九年冀西沙河荒造林局结合当地政府，在沙荒区根据各村条件与群众要求，组织了各式各样的造林合作社，明确规定了集体造林的权益问题，结合农民切身利益，使大家踊跃参加。又因为专业干部的深入和具体的领导，提高了造林的技术，造成较大的有效的防风林带与林网。使沙荒造林成为有计划、有组织、有技术性的群众运动，而且一季比一季的有显著的进步。大部分村庄已知掌握密栽、少露深埋、紧砸等要点，在干沙地压杨柳条，并且采用弓形压条法。株行距离，在各重点村已从习惯的一丈缩小到较合理的三尺至五尺。因此平均成活率春季达百分之八十一，雨季更提高到百分之九十。
    乙、合作造林的好处
    健全的群众性的造林合作社，都是根据自愿、等价、互利的原则结合起来的。它具有下面的优点：
    （一）互助合作，解决私人因缺乏树苗、技术、劳力、土地，而无法造林的困难。
    （二）它把集体造林与私人利益密切的结合起来。人人觉得自己有一份，是给自己栽树，栽得就好。
    （三）有组织，有领导，管理好，护林不成问题。
    （四）权益确定，有了收入按股分红；不致像过去的集体造林，常发生树权、地权的纠纷。
    （五）有固定的组织，事业不断的扩大，进行长期的有计划的造林。
    （六）在地权分散的犯风地上，能合起来造较大的防护林带。
    （七）对缺树苗的地区，政府可向造林合作社以树苗现款投资或贷给。并可将应分得之树秧，扶助其他村庄造林。
    （八）在组织起来的基础上，可发挥群众的创造性，利于提高技术。
