　　Sunan Changzhou Native Produce Company
    Coordinates Disaster Relief, Purchases Native Products
    Promotes Urban-Rural Exchange and Expands Currency Circulation

    [Our newspaper Changzhou News] Since the Changzhou branch of the China Native Produce Company was ordered to prepare in April, it began to coordinate production and disaster relief work in early May, organizing cadres to go to the countryside to purchase native products and actively open up sales channels to the outside world. At the same time, it promoted industrial products to rural areas to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and expand currency circulation. On the other hand, it also supplied the general needs of the city with native products from other districts.

    Changzhou districts such as Yixing, Liyang, and Wujin counties are rich in native products such as bamboo, firewood, bamboo ware, native paper, and rush bags. Tens of thousands of farmers depend on native products for their livelihoods.

    In order to purchase native products in a planned manner, the company began to transfer cadres to Yixing, Liyang, Wujin and other counties at the end of April to understand the actual situation. In early May, it officially started purchasing through cooperatives and obtained assistance from the local government. As of early June, the three counties purchased a total of 18,839 dan of firewood, 10,034 dan of bamboo, 10,112 bamboo poles, and other bamboo products, pine boards, black tea, writing paper, rush bags, and other items, investing more than 316.27 million yuan in purchasing funds.

    The company also promoted the sales of self-purchased native products and native products from other brother companies. In late May, at the first joint meeting of managers of the Sunan Branch Company, it was decided that the materials purchased by each branch company, in addition to supplying local urban needs, should also be transferred to Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang and other places for sale. A large number of firewood and various bamboo products, rush bags, tea and other items have been shipped to various places. In order to promote native products from other regions, 2,000 grass mats were shipped back from Xushuguan, Suzhou, to supply the needs of Changzhou City.

    In order to solve the sales difficulties of Changzhou's industrial products, the company purchased 600 dan of soybean oil and 3,952 dan of soybean cakes from Doubing factories such as Puli Ren, Xie Feng Ren, and Tongxing Xie on May 24th and 25th, so that the capital of each oil factory could be turned over and production could continue. In order to recover currency and cooperate with silkworm cocoon collection, the company specially established sales organizations in counties and towns in silkworm cocoon collection areas, and has shipped 390 dan of soybean oil and more than 4,700 dan of soybean cakes to various sales locations to meet needs. In just over a month from the beginning of May to the beginning of June, the company's active purchases have initially improved the lives of the masses. In Zhangzhu alone, the lives of more than 10,000 mountain people have been guaranteed and they have survived the spring famine.

    Secondly, it solved the sales of native products and supplied the needs of cities and other regions. Among them, most of the firewood was supplied to the China Silkworm Company as cocoon firewood.

    Thirdly, through this purchase and sale, the RMB flowed into the countryside, and the credibility of the local currency was further consolidated. For example, in Zhangzhu, not only was a large amount of RMB circulating in the market, but people were also happy to save or use it.

    In addition, since the purchase started with cooperative members, farmers are willing to participate in the cooperative, which has significantly increased the number of members. Of course, some shortcomings were also revealed in the purchase. For example, the purchase price adopted the highest local market price, which increased the company's costs and did not take into account break-even self-sufficiency, and there was a one-sided mass perspective. Secondly, the technical experience of the cadres was insufficient, and the inspection of goods was not strict during the purchase, so a small number of substandard goods were mixed in, causing losses to the company. Also, some things, such as the purchase of too much bamboo, could not be sold for a while, affecting the company's capital turnover.

　　苏南常州土产公司
    配合救灾收购土产
    促进城乡交流扩大货币流通面
    【本报常州讯】中国土产公司常州支公司，自四月奉令筹备以来，五月初即开始配合生产救灾工作，组织干部下乡收购土产，并积极向外打开销路，同时向农村推销工业品，以加强城乡物资交流及扩大货币流通面。另一方面，也以其他分区之土产品，供应本市的一般需要。
    常州分区如宜兴、溧阳、武进等县，盛产毛竹、树柴、竹器、土纸、蒲包等土产。依土产为生之农民，达数万人。
    该公司为了有计划地进行收购土产，在四月底即着手抽调干部分赴宜兴、溧阳、武进等县，了解实际情况，五月初即正式着手通过合作社进行收购，并取得当地政府协助。至六月初，三县共计购进树柴一八、八三九担，毛竹一○、○三四担，柄竹一○、一一二根，及其他竹器、松板、红茶，表芯纸、蒲包等物。投放收购资金达三亿一千六百二十七万余元。
    该公司并进行推销自购土产及其他兄弟公司之土产。五月下旬，在苏南分公司第一届经理联席会议上曾决定各支公司所购物资，除供给本地城市需用外，并分别调往无锡、苏州、镇江、松江等地销售，现已有大批树柴和各种竹器、蒲包、茶叶等物运往各地。为了推销其他地区土产，并运回苏州浒墅关草席二千条，供应常市需要。
    该公司为解决常市工业产品的销路困难，在五月二十四、二十五两日即收购溥利仁、协丰仁、同兴协等豆饼厂豆油六百担，豆饼三千九百五十二担，使各油厂的资金得以周转，继续生产。为了回笼货币，配合收茧，该公司又特依收茧地区各县乡镇，建立销售机构，并已运往各销售地点豆油三九○担，豆饼四千七百余担，以供应需要。从五月初至六月上旬的短短一个多月来，由于该公司的积极收购，已初步改善了群众生活，单张渚一地，即使万余山民的生活获得保障，并度过了春荒。
    其次是解决了土产品的销路，供给了城市及其他地区的需要，其中树柴一项，绝大部分是供给了中蚕公司作为茧柴。
    再次是通过了这次收购及推销，使得人民币流入乡村，本币威信更加巩固，如张渚非但市面上大量流通人民币，且人民多乐于保存或使用了。
    另外，由于收购先从合作社社员着手，故农民都愿参加合作社，使社员数量显著增加。当然，在收购中，也表现出一些缺点。如收购价采取当地最高市价，使公司成本加大，未考虑到保本自给，存在着片面的群众观点。其次是干部技术经验不足，收购时对货物的检查不严，因此有少数次货掺杂其间，使公司受到损失。也有些东西如毛竹收购太多，一时无法销出，影响到公司的资金周转。
