　　The Tong County Special District Federation of Trade Unions, Youth League, and Women's Federation of Hebei Province sent a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people on the 17th, stating:

　　Nearly three million organized people in Tong County Special District, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China, are as concerned about Korea's national liberation war as they are about our own country's liberation war and economic construction. We are eagerly reading every piece of victory news about the Korean liberation war. Your victory is our victory because we belong to the same world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union.

　　We vow to support our People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan by intensifying our production and construction, eliminating all American-Chiang special agents and bandits, actively paying our due summer grain taxes, and launching a peace signature campaign, etc., to resolutely, decisively, and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnants. We know that striving to support the war to liberate Taiwan is supporting the Korean national liberation war.

    我们中华人民共和国河北省通县专区近三百万有组织的人民，像关心着我们祖国解放战争和经济建设一样的关心着朝鲜的民族解放战争，我们热烈地阅读着每一条有关朝鲜解放战争的胜利消息，你们的胜利，就是我们的胜利；因为我们同是属于以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营  。
    我们誓以加紧我们的生产建设、肃清一切美蒋特务匪徒、积极的缴纳我们应当缴纳的夏征公粮、展开和平签名运动等实际行动来支援我们人民解放军解放台湾，坚决、干脆、彻底消灭蒋介石残匪。我们知道，努力的支援解放台湾战争，就是支援了朝鲜的民族解放战争。
