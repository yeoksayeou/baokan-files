Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 22nd, TASS dispatch from Washington, July 21st: Truman submitted a message to Congress on the 19th, requesting action to expand the scope of American aggression in Korea and elsewhere, and to push the United States onto the path of war mobilization.

Truman requested Congress to appropriate approximately 10 billion dollars in additional military funds, to abolish the current legal restrictions on the number of American armed forces, and to authorize the Department of Defense to mobilize the National Guard and reserve troops according to the number "required".

In his message, Truman attempted to portray the American aggression in Korea as a "peace mission" of the United States. In order to defend the open aggression of the United States against Korea, Truman put forward the illegal resolutions of the Security Council on June 25, June 27, and July 7. As everyone knows, these resolutions violate the principles and charter of the United Nations. Truman only mentioned the "proof" of such "peaceful" motives of the United States, but remained silent on the response of the world's progressive public to the Korean incident, and the position of many member states of the United Nations that actually refused to participate in the American armed intervention in Korea. Truman desperately praised the military actions taken by the American authorities against the Korean people.

Not only that, Truman repeated the promises made in his infamous statement, saying that the US government would not only invade Korea, but also take military measures in the Philippines, Taiwan and Indochina. He frankly admitted that the United States is stepping up war preparations in Europe and the American continent.

Truman said that "the war in Korea" and other planned military measures will inevitably affect the American economy, which "requires a fundamental change in the policy of using economic resources." At the same time, Truman said: "We must admit that for several years there is a need to support continuous defense spending."

He believes that it is necessary to "rapidly take some general measures to adapt to the increase in demand caused by the expansion of military plans."

In this regard, Truman said that he requires all government agencies to examine government plans so that they can be revised to reduce the demand for labor, commodities, raw materials, manpower and equipment that compete with defense needs. In this way, Truman showed that he planned to cut public peace construction and other social welfare undertakings.

Truman emphasized that the increase in military expenditures will cause a sharp increase in overall federal expenditures, and said that increasing taxes is necessary. Judging from Truman's words, the possibility of rationing American consumer goods and taking "more drastic measures" is not ruled out. Truman asserted that "resolute action" must be taken to deal with the current situation.

Truman used threats in his message. He referred to the well-known victim of aggression in Korea as the aggressor, and tried his best to shirk the responsibility of the American imperialists for aggression against Korea. He said: "In today's world, new acts of aggression are likely to break the thread of world peace."

Truman's message to Congress was welcomed by the monopoly capitalists and the representatives of Wall Street in the Democratic and Republican parties. This message clearly proves that they intend to impose new economic burdens on the shoulders of the working people in order to implement the American imperialists' aggression plans.

Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress have predicted that Truman's proposals will be passed quickly.

However, ordinary Americans have begun to express increasing dissatisfaction with the burdens brought about by the imperialists' gambling in Korea. According to calculations by Dun & Bradstreet, the prices of consumer goods in the United States have increased by 7.6 percent since the United States began its aggression against Korea. Due to the continuous increase in prices, various consumer organizations have begun to protest the rising cost of living. On July 18, the Brooklyn Housewives Consumer Committee sent a letter to New York Governor Dewey, asking him to take measures to stop price increases.

### 杜鲁门咨文国会要求扩大侵略  为对朝鲜的侵略行动辩护推诿责任  请求增拨军费及授权动员后备兵员

　　杜鲁门咨文国会要求扩大侵略
    为对朝鲜的侵略行动辩护推诿责任
    请求增拨军费及授权动员后备兵员
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十一日讯：杜鲁门于十九日向国会提出咨文，要求采取行动来扩大美国侵略朝鲜与其他地方的范围，并把美国推到战争动员的道路上去。
    杜鲁门请求国会增拨约一百亿美元的军事款项，废除目前对于美国武装部队人数的法律限制，并授权国防部按照“所需要的”人数来动员国民警卫队及后备军队。
    杜鲁门在其咨文中企图把美国在朝鲜的侵略，描写成为美国的一种“和平使命”。杜鲁门为了辩护美国对朝鲜的公开侵略行动，就提出安理会六月二十五日、六月二十七日及七月七日的非法决议。大家知道，这些决议是违反联合国的原则与宪章的。杜鲁门仅仅说到美国这一类的“和平”动机的“证明”，而对世界进步公众对朝鲜事件的反响，以及实际上拒绝参加美国武装干涉朝鲜的联合国许多会员国的立场却闭口不言。杜鲁门拼命地赞扬美国当局对朝鲜人民所作的军事行动。
    不仅如此，杜鲁门重复申述他那声名狼藉的声明中所作的诺言，说美国政府不仅仅要侵略朝鲜，而且在菲律宾、台湾与印度支那采取了军事措施。他坦白承认：美国正加紧在欧洲与美洲大陆从事战争准备。
    杜鲁门说，“朝鲜的战争”及其他计划中的军事措施，将不可避免地要影响美国的经济，这就“需要根本改变经济资源使用的方针”。同时，杜鲁门说：“我们必须承认：在若干年之内都有支持赓续不断的国防费用的必要。”
    他认为必须“迅速采取若干普遍的措施，以适应由于军事计划的扩大而引起的需求的增加”。
    关于这一方面，杜鲁门说：他要求一切政府机关检查政府的各种计划，俾能修正这些计划，以减少对那些与国防需要相竞争的劳务、商品、原料、人力和设备的需求。这样，杜鲁门就表明了他计划削减公共和平建设及其他社会福利事业。
    杜鲁门强调军事费用的增加将引起整个联邦支出的急剧增加，他说，增加税收是必要的。从杜鲁门的话看来，对美国消费品的配给，采取“更急剧的措施”，这种可能性并不是没有的。杜鲁门断言须采取“坚决的行动”以应付目前的局势。
    杜鲁门在他的咨文中使用威胁。他把众所周知的朝鲜受侵略之害的一方，称之为发动侵略的一方，竭力推诿美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的责任。他说：“在今天的世界上，新的侵略行动很可能把世界和平之弦崩断。”
    杜鲁门致国会的咨文，受到垄断资本家以及华尔街在民主党和共和党中的代表们的欢迎，这个咨文清楚地证明打算把新的经济负担加在劳动人民的肩上，以便执行美帝国主义者的侵略计划。
    国会中的共和党和民主党领袖都预言：杜鲁门的建议将被迅速通过。
    但是，普通的美国人已开始对帝国主义者在朝鲜的赌博所带来的负担，日益表示不满。根据邓·布列德斯特里统计公司的计算：自美国开始侵略朝鲜以来，美国的消费品的价格增加了百分之七点六。由于物价不断的增高，各种消费者组织已开始抗议生活费用的上涨。七月十八日，布鲁克林家庭主妇消费者委员会致函纽约州长杜威，要求他采取措施制止物价上涨。
