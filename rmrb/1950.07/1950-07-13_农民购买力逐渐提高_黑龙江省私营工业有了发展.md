　　Farmers' Purchasing Power Gradually Increases
    Private Industry in Heilongjiang Province Develops
    [Our Heilongjiang News] Private industry in Heilongjiang Province has shown significant development with the increase in farmers' purchasing power after the land reform. The province is an agricultural area and had very little industry in the past. According to statistics from thirty-six counties and one city in the province at the end of last year, compared with a survey in May this year (excluding Heihe Prefecture), private industrial enterprises increased from 13,501 to 14,370 in five months, an increase of 6.44 percent. Capital expanded from 20,638,924 yuan (Northeast currency, same below) to 39,451,263 yuan, an increase of 91 percent (rate of stable currency value). The number of employees increased from 34,983 to 38,648, an increase of over 10 percent. Among them, small-scale rice milling, food processing, food manufacturing, and oil production developed the fastest. This clearly indicates an improvement in people's living standards. With the recovery and development of rural productivity, the production of new-style farm tools, carts, furniture, wooden boxes, etc., also increased by 19 percent, and blacksmithing for sickles, scythes, axes, etc., increased by 20 percent. Other iron and steel utensils, fur, leather making, machinery repair, and stationery manufacturing have also generally developed.
    The development of private industry in Heilongjiang Province is also due to the correct implementation of the policy of supporting industry and commerce by the People's Government. For example, from January to April this year, the People's Government issued industrial loans of more than 10 billion yuan, solving the difficulties of some factories lacking funds. It also organized purchasing committees and raw material supply and marketing stations to help factories solve raw material problems, and established business relationships with cooperatives in the vast countryside through urban-rural mutual aid committees, helping factories sell their products. The state-owned trading companies have also universally processed orders from factories, playing a certain role in guaranteeing production and profits. Under the active leadership of the People's Governments and trade unions in various counties, labor-capital relations have also improved. At present, the vast majority of private industrial enterprises have signed collective labor-capital contracts by industry, ensuring that capital has profits to be made and the workers' welfare benefits are also guaranteed to a certain extent, under the premise of developing production.

　　农民购买力逐渐提高
    黑龙江省私营工业有了发展
    【本报黑龙江讯】黑龙江省私营工业，随着土改后农民购买力的提高，已有显著发展。该省为农业区，过去工业很少。据去年年终全省三十六县、一市的统计和今年五月的调查比较（黑河专署除外），在五个月中，私营工业已从一万三千五百零一家增加到一万四千三百七十家，计增加了百分之六·四四；资金从二○、六三八、九二四万元（东北币，下同）扩大为三九、四五一、二六三万元，计增加百分之九十一（币值稳定的比率）；职工从三四、九八三名增加到三八、六四八名，计增加百分之十强。其中小型碾米业、食粮加工、食品制造、制油等业的发展最快。这明显地表示出人民生活水平的提高。随着农村生产力的恢复与发展，新式农具、大车、家具、木箱等业也增加了百分之十九，制镰刀；钐刀、斧等铁匠业增加百分之二十。其他钢铁用具、毛皮、制革、机器修理及文具制造业等也普遍地有了发展。
    黑龙江省私营工业的发展，同时也是由于人民政府正确地执行了扶助工商业的政策。如在今年一至四月即人民政府发出工业贷款一百余亿元，解决了部分工厂缺少资金的困难。并组织采购委员会、原料供销站，帮助各工厂解决原料问题；通过城乡互助委员会和广大农村的合作社发生业务关系，帮助各工厂推销产品。各公营贸易公司又普遍向各工厂加工订货，起了保证生产和利润的一定作用。劳资关系在各县人民政府及工会的积极领导下也趋向好转。目前绝大多数私营工业已按行业签订劳资集体合同，在发展生产的前题下，使资方有利可图，工人的福利待遇也得到一定的保证。
