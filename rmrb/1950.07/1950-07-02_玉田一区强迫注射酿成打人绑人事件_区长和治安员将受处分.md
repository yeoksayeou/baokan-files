　　Forced Injections in Yutian First District Lead to Beatings and Kidnappings; District Head and Security Officer to be Punished
　　On June 14th, at the market in Hongqiao Town, Yutian First District, four comrades from the district's Medical Association were administering vaccinations to the masses. Due to insufficient prior publicity and explanation, some people were unwilling to be vaccinated. Seeing this, Hu Yudan, the director of the Medical Association, went to the town and brought four militiamen, intending to use armed force to compel the masses to be vaccinated. This made the masses even more fearful, and they scattered and fled. A farmer from Shizhuangzi Village, Zhang Wenxi, was grabbed by a doctor. Zhang was unwilling to be vaccinated and argued with the doctor. Hu Yudan, the director of the Medical Association, then brought the town's security officer, Gu Fengqi, and three militiamen, saying that Zhang Wenxi was not complying with government orders and was refusing vaccination. Upon hearing this, Gu Fengqi, without any explanation, beat Zhang Wenxi, leaving him with a bruised and swollen nose, and tied him up before handing him over to the district government. Zhao Huaguo, the district head, listened only to the security officer's side of the story and, without asking about the circumstances, hung Zhang up for interrogation, asking him, "Why did you hit the doctor?" When Zhang denied it, the district head beat him again and, after tying him up tightly, sent him to the county People's Court.
　　After questioning by the court, the truth of the matter was clarified, and Zhang Wenxi was released and sent home. The county government has now transferred Gu Fengqi, the security officer of Hongqiao Town in the First District, and Zhao Huaguo, the district head, to the county level, and will handle this case according to the law.

    Editor's Note: For those who are unwilling to receive vaccinations, only patient explanation, pointing out the serious dangers of not getting vaccinated, can solve the problem; coercive orders will only increase the other party's misunderstanding. It is even more inappropriate to bring militiamen to help enforce vaccinations. Security officer Gu Fengqi and district head Zhao Huaguo beat Zhang Wenxi because he was unwilling to be vaccinated, which is a knowing violation of human rights and should be punished.

　　玉田一区强迫注射酿成打人绑人事件
    区长和治安员将受处分
    在河北玉田一区虹桥镇六月十四日的市集上，该区医联会四位同志给群众注射防疫针。由于事先宣传解释不足，有些人不愿注射。医联主任胡玉丹见此情况，竟到该镇找来四个民兵，想用武装强迫群众注射。这样一来，群众更惊惶了，就四散奔逃。一位石庄子村的农民张文喜，被医生拉住了。张不愿注射，和医生争执起来。医联主任胡玉丹又找来该镇治安员谷凤岐和三个民兵，说张文喜不遵守政府法令，不打防疫针。谷凤岐听了，不容分说，就把张文喜打了个鼻青脸肿，并把他捆绑起来交区公所。该区区长赵华国偏听治安员一面之词，不问情由，就把张吊起来审讯，问他：“为啥打医生？”张不承认，区长又毒打他一顿，并把他五花大绑后送交该县人民法院。
    经过法院询问，弄清了事情的真象，便将张文喜释放回家。该县政府现已把一区虹桥镇治安员谷凤岐和区长赵华国同时调到县里，将依法处理这一案件。

    编者按：对于不愿打防疫针的人，只有耐心解释，指出不打防疫针的严重危险，才能解决问题；强迫命令反会增加对方的误解。找民兵来帮助强迫注射，更不应该。治安员谷凤岐和区长赵华国因为张文喜不愿注射，竟加以殴打，这是侵害人权的知法犯法的行为，应该受到处分。
