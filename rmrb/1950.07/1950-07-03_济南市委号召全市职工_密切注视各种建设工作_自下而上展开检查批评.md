　　Jinan Municipal Committee Calls on All City Workers
　　Closely Monitor Various Construction Works and Launch Inspection and Criticism from the Bottom Up

　　On June 16th, the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a letter to all city workers, calling on them to enthusiastically offer criticisms and opinions on shortcomings and errors in various works, to ensure the victorious advancement of national construction undertakings by continuously overcoming shortcomings and errors. After the Party Central Committee issued the decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals on April 19th, it immediately gained the active support and response of the working brothers and the broad masses of the people. The Jinan Municipal Committee, in conjunction with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, sent working groups to inspect work in various factories, and received the support and assistance of the working brothers everywhere. Some workers directly wrote articles to Dazhong Daily, exposing the bureaucratic, commandist, and detached-from-the-masses bad work styles existing in some organs, factories, and enterprises, as well as some serious problems in production. Some workers actively provided opinions to the working groups, reflected situations, and launched criticism and self-criticism at various meetings. The Municipal Committee expressed sincere welcome in the letter to the working class’s serious and responsible spirit towards the country, the people, and their own political party, and pointed out: As long as all party member cadres can establish the idea of wholeheartedly relying on the working class, and all cadres who have made mistakes can humbly conduct self-criticism with the help and supervision of the working brothers, it will greatly benefit the promotion of Jinan's construction work. However, according to the report of the Municipal Committee's inspection working group, many organs and cadres still have serious complacency and treat the opinions of the masses with a bureaucratic attitude. Many reasonable suggestions from the masses are "locked up" in offices, and no one pays attention. Some individual cadres even suppress democracy and refuse criticism, hindering the development of criticism and self-criticism. To this end, the Municipal Committee solemnly announced in the letter: "The Jinan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will give full support to all reasonable and achievable opinions and demands put forward by the worker comrades." And "will more widely and deeply awaken the broad masses of workers to carry out bottom-up criticism and supervision to improve our current work. We warmly welcome all criticisms and opinions from the broad masses of workers and give them firm protection. No retaliation or ridicule is allowed." The Municipal Committee also called on the masses of workers to closely monitor the progress of the entire construction work. Everyone is welcome to directly report the situation and put forward opinions to the Municipal Committee, or submit articles to newspapers by writing letters, making phone calls, face-to-face talks, and other means when necessary. The Municipal Committee Office will set up a special person to be responsible for this work.

　　济南市委号召全市职工
    密切注视各种建设工作  自下而上展开检查批评
    六月十六日中共济南市委致函全市职工，号召他们对各种工作中的缺点和错误，热烈提出批评和意见，以保证国家建设事业在不断克服缺点错误中胜利前进。四月十九日党中央发布了关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定后，即获得了工人弟兄和广大人民的积极拥护与响应。济南市委结合市总工会派出工作组到各厂检查工作，到处得到工人弟兄的支持与帮助。有的工人直接写稿给大众日报，揭发了某些机关、工厂、企业单位中存在着官僚主义、命令主义，脱离群众的恶劣作风，以及生产中的一些严重问题。有的工友向工作组积极提供意见，反映情况，并在各种会议上展开了批评与自我批评。对工人阶级这种对国家对人民对自己政党的认真负责精神，市委在信中表示热诚的欢迎，并指出：只要全体党员干部都能由此树立起全心全意依靠工人阶级的思想，一切犯有错误的干部都能在工人弟兄的帮助和监督下，虚心进行自我批评，就将大大有利于济南建设工作的推进。但根据市委检查工作组的报告，目前尚有不少的机关与干部存在着严重的骄傲自满情绪，以官僚主义的态度对待群众的意见。许多合理的群众建议被“禁闭”在办公室内，没人理睬。甚至有个别干部压制民主拒绝批评。使批评与自我批评的开展受到各种阻碍。为此，市委在信中特郑重宣告：“中共济南市委会对于职工同志们所提出的一切合理而又能作到的意见与要求，将予以充分支持。”并“将更加广泛深入的唤起广大职工群众来进行自下而上的批评与监督，以改进我们当前的各项工作。我们热烈的欢迎来自广大职工群众中的一切批评和意见，并予以坚决保护。不允许有任何报复嘲笑现象产生。”市委并号召职工群众密切注视整个建设工作的进程。欢迎大家在必要时，以写信、打电话、面谈等各种方式，直接向市委反映情况提出意见，或向报社投稿。市委办公室将设专人负责这一工作。
