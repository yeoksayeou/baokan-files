Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Promotes Production by Establishing Systems Through the Workers' Congress; Democratic Management Committee is Being Prepared

[This newspaper Taiyuan dispatch] The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has universally established systems such as shift handover, regular inspections, and rewards and penalties through the workers' representative conferences in various units, effectively promoting production. In the Power Department of the plant, power outages occurred for 260 hours in March. Since the workers' representative conference was held in April and the necessary production systems mentioned above were established, the outage time was reduced to 21 hours, and further reduced to 18 hours and 45 minutes in May. The Transportation Department was able to complete the transportation tasks on schedule due to the general overhaul of locomotives. The Iron Smelting Department overfulfilled the June production plan six days ahead of schedule. With the establishment of the new systems, workers began to establish new work attitudes; criticism and self-criticism also began to develop. Veteran technical workers first launched a competition to eliminate dozing off. When large trucks in the Transportation Department scattered manganese sand on the road, workers immediately raised criticisms. In particular, the self-criticism of leading cadres, such as the leading cadres of the Repair Department rigorously criticizing their own superficial work and bureaucratic style, and the director of the Steelmaking Department reviewing his own bureaucratism at the conference, had a great educational effect on the masses. However, the workers' representative conference of the plant did not mobilize the masses sufficiently, and some of the elected representatives could not truly represent the opinions of the masses; some activists were not elected. The workers' representative conference has not yet completely resolved issues related to production equipment, repairs, and tool replenishment. These all need to be further improved. The plant is now preparing to establish a management committee in order to strengthen the democratization of factory management.

　　太原钢铁厂通过工代会
    建立制度推进生产
    现正筹建民主管理委员会
    【本报太原讯】太原钢铁厂各单位通过职工代表会普遍建立了交接班、定期检查、奖罚等制度，有力地推进了生产。该厂动力部，三月份停电二百六十小时，自四月份召开职工代表会，建立了上述各种必要的生产制度后，停电时间即减到二十一小时，五月份继续减到十八小时零四十五分。运输部由于普遍地检修了机车，得以按期完成输送任务。炼铁部则提前六天超额完成六月份生产计划。随着新的制度的建立，工友们开始树立起新的劳动态度；批评与自我批评亦随之开展。老技术工人首先发动了消灭打瞌睡的竞赛。运输部大车拉锰砂撒在路上，工友们马上提出批评。特别是领导干部的自我检讨，如修理部领导干部严格地批判了自己工作不深入及事务主义的作风，炼钢部主任在大会上检讨了自己的官僚主义，对群众的教育很大。但该厂职工代表会由于发动群众不够，所选出的部分代表不能真正代表群众的意见；有的积极分子却没有选上。职工代表会对有关生产设备、修理、工具补充等问题解决的还不够完满。这些都有待于进一步加以改进。现该厂正在筹建管理委员会，以便加强工厂管理民主化。
