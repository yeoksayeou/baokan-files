　　Begin to Establish Factory Management Committees

　　Democratic Management Experience Gained by the Eleventh Factory Will Be Widely Promoted

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Following the movement to streamline and economize and the production movement, the factories affiliated with the Shanghai China Textile Company have been studying and discussing the democratization of management for two months. Starting last month, they have entered the stage of preparing to establish management committees and employee representative conferences. In order to uniformly lead the factories towards the democratization of management, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of the company organized a Democratic Management Promotion Committee in late June, and organized two working groups to conduct key experiments at the Eleventh Factory and the First Wool Textile Factory to learn from experience and promote it to all factories.

　　The China Textile Eleventh Factory convened an employee representative meeting on June 26 and established a democratic management committee on July 3. However, the factory's democratic management work went through a tortuous process before it got on the right track. In early June, the factory established a Democratic Management Promotion Committee and conducted a pilot project in the spinning workshop as a typical group. Because the leading cadres' thinking of relying on the masses was not clear; the masses were not thoroughly mobilized; and at the same time, they did not start with the main problems in current production; coupled with the labor union's lack of effective cooperation, all systems and methods became mere formalities.

　　After accepting the lessons of the first phase of failure, in addition to conducting in-depth self-criticism, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League further unified their guiding ideology and decided to take the establishment of a handover inspection system as the starting point for their work. In the process of mobilizing the masses to inspect unreasonable production phenomena, the workers in Class A of the weaving machine workshop proposed to formulate a vehicle dispatch agreement due to unfair vehicle dispatch. The administration and the labor union immediately supported it and further mobilized the workers to put forward opinions. The leading cadres immediately handled the opinions put forward by the workers that could be handled. For example, problems such as toilets, pools, and wardrobes have been resolved, which greatly encouraged the workers. As a result, all units universally formulated handover agreements and contact contracts, and all workshops consciously formulated labor covenants. Under the condition of improved worker morale, the labor union launched a production competition to eliminate the factory's high rate of substandard cloth at the time.

　　Subsequently, the factory's production teams democratically elected 129 employee representatives and convened the first employee representative meeting from June 26 to 30. The meeting mainly discussed how to eliminate substandard cloth, continue to carry out the Red Flag movement, how to consolidate labor covenants, and workers' welfare issues such as running workers' night schools, rectifying cooperatives, and workers' canteens. These are all problems that workers urgently need to solve. Through democratic discussion, the employees further clarified that it is impossible to improve welfare without doing a good job in production. At the meeting, most of the worker representatives' understanding was improved, and criticisms and self-criticisms were launched against the incorrect thinking of individual representatives. At the employee representative meeting, the factory management committee's organizational law was also discussed, and eight employee committee members of the management committee were elected.

　　Currently, the democratic management experience of the China Textile Eleventh Factory is being summarized and promoted to all factories in the company.

### 上海中纺公司所属各厂  开始建立工厂管理委员会  十一厂取得民主管理经验将被普遍推行

　　上海中纺公司所属各厂
    开始建立工厂管理委员会
    十一厂取得民主管理经验将被普遍推行
    【本报讯】上海中纺公司所属各工厂，继精简节约运动、生产运动之后，已进行了两个月的管理民主化的学习和讨论，从上月份开始，即已步入准备建立管委会和职工代表会的阶段。该公司为统一领导各厂走向管理民主化，党、政、工、团已于六月下旬组织了民主管理推行委员会，并组织了两个工作组，分赴十一厂及毛纺一厂作重点试验，以吸取经验推行各厂。
    中纺十一厂已于六月二十六日召开职工代表会，七月三日成立民主管理委员会。但该厂的民主管理工作是经过了曲折过程才走入正轨的。六月初，该厂即成立了民主管理推行委员会，并以细纱间为典型组试行。因为领导干部依靠群众的思想不明确；没有深入的发动起群众；同时没有从当前生产中的主要问题入手；加之工会未作有力的配合，致使一切的制度和办法流于形式。
    接受了第一阶段失败的教训，党、政、工、团除作深刻检讨外，进一步统一了领导思想，并决定以建立交班检查制为工作的起点。在发动群众检查生产的不合理现象过程中，布机间甲班因派车不公平，工人自动提出订立派车公约，行政和工会立即予以支持，并进一步发动工人提意见。领导干部对工人所提出的意见，能办的立刻就办了，例如像厕所、水池、衣橱等问题均已解决，给了工人很大的鼓舞。于是各单位普遍订立了交班公约和联系合同，各车间纷纷自觉地订立了劳动公约。在工人生产情绪提高的条件下，工会便发动工人开展生产竞赛，消灭当时该厂次布率过高的现象。
    接着，该厂各生产小组民主选出职工代表一百二十九人，于六月二十六日至三十日召开了第一届职工代表会议。会议主要讨论了如何消灭次布、继续开展红旗运动和如何巩固劳动公约，以及职工福利方面的举办工人夜校、整顿合作社和工人食堂等问题。这些都是工人迫切需要解决的。经过民主讨论，使职工进一步明确了不搞好生产，就不可能改善福利。在会议上大部工人代表认识提高了，针对个别代表的不正确思想，展开了批评和自我批评。在工代会上，又讨论了工厂管委会组织法，并选出管委会职工委员八人。
    目前中纺十一厂的民主管理经验正在陆续总结，并向全公司各厂推广。
