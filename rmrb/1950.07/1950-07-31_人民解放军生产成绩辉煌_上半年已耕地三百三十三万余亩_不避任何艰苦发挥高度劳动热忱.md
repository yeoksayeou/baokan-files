Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The large-scale production and construction movement launched by the Chinese People's Liberation Army this year has achieved brilliant results. Since Chairman Mao issued the order on December 5th last year for the army to participate in production and construction, the People's Liberation Army in various regions has implemented the policy of labor production and long-term construction, formulating production plans based on local conditions and engaging in agriculture, water conservancy projects, various construction projects, and handicraft production, all while not hindering military tasks, defending the country, suppressing bandits, consolidating public security, and strengthening training.

	Turning Barren Wilderness into Fertile Land, Striving for Good Harvests

	In the past six months, the People's Liberation Army has cultivated over 3,338,000 mu of land in agricultural production. The land reclamation achievements of the Xinjiang Military Region troops are particularly significant. The troops of this military region have cultivated 800,000 mu of land on the barren wilderness north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in the motherland's border region, exceeding the original plan by 33 percent. A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army in the Central and Southern region, immediately after completing its combat missions, left the Central and Southern region in March and marched back to the Northeast for production after more than a month of travel. It reclaimed 520,000 mu of land on the North Manchurian Plain and along the Songhua River and Liao River. Currently, troops in various regions are working hard to weed and thin seedlings, striving for a good harvest.

	Extensively Carrying Out Water Conservancy Construction, Digging Rivers and Building Canals on a Grand Scale

	While carrying out agricultural production, various PLA units have extensively carried out water conservancy construction. The Northwest Military Region troops have built and renovated new and old canals that can irrigate more than one million mu of land. The North China Military Region troops completed the water conservancy projects for more than 20 rivers, including the Hai River, Luan River, and Sanggan River, totaling more than 11 million cubic meters of earthwork, in late June. This not only increased the convenience of farmland irrigation but also provided considerable protection for the lives and property of the people along the rivers. A certain unit of the Southwest Military Region undertook the annual maintenance project of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Guanxian in January this year, which can irrigate 3.5 million mu of land. It was completed and water was released on April 2nd, shortening the maintenance time by 55 days compared to last year and saving three-fifths of the maintenance cost compared to last year. Troops in other military regions have also carried out various large and small-scale water conservancy projects such as repairing dikes and dredging rivers in their驻地 (zhùdì - garrison locations).

	Investing in Huge Transportation Projects, Actively Building Highways and Railways

	Various PLA units have also invested a large amount of labor in transportation construction. Tens of thousands of troops from the Northwest Military Region undertook the renovation of the 710-kilometer Tianshui-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway and the construction project of the Tianshui-Lanzhou section, completing more than 2.3 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. A unit of the Southwest Military Region undertook the construction of the 530-kilometer Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which had been酝酿 (yùnniàng - brewing/in preparation) for more than 40 years without completion. Construction started on June 16th and is expected to be fully opened to traffic by the end of next year. Troops stationed in Qinghai are building the 820-kilometer Xining-Yushu highway in severe cold, and have now reached the Ela Mountain, a total of 346 kilometers. Troops stationed in Xinjiang are also building thousands of kilometers of highways in deserts and barren mountains. Many other troops in various regions have undertaken the construction of highways, railways, bridges, and other construction projects.

	Engaging in Various Industrial, Mining, and Sideline Occupations According to the Actual Conditions of the Garrison

	In addition to the above-mentioned major production projects, the troops in various regions are also engaged in various industrial, handicraft, mining, and sideline production activities based on the actual conditions of their驻地 (zhùdì - garrison locations). The livestock industry operated by the Northwest Military Region troops has achieved considerable results. According to incomplete statistics, they have raised more than 6,300 cattle, more than 136,000 sheep, more than 26,000 pigs, and more than 10,000 horses.

	Because the vast majority of the People's Liberation Army comes from the working people and has various production experiences and a high degree of labor enthusiasm, they have demonstrated the spirit of working diligently without avoiding any difficulties in the production and construction movement. The commanders of the Northwest Military Region put forward the slogan "Settle down, take root, work and study part-time, and diligently build the Great Northwest," and actively engage in production and construction. The road construction troops in Qinghai actively build roads in the Ela Mountain area, where the temperature is 14 degrees below zero, the air is thin, and breathing is difficult. A certain engineer regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region launched a bridge construction project on the frozen, one-meter-thick Manas River in the severe winter of 20 degrees below zero. They completed the Manas River Bridge, which was originally scheduled to take half a year, in four months and twenty days, ahead of schedule. The troops of the Fourth Field Army who returned to the Northeast for production launched large-scale production preparations in the ice and snow, which resulted in the great achievement of reclaiming 520,000 mu of wasteland. Troops in other regions have also demonstrated the spirit of hard work and struggle to actively complete their tasks. In addition, the PLA units are also actively helping the local masses to carry out labor production, cooperating with the people of the whole country to heal the wounds left by the long-term war, and promoting the economic construction of New China.

　　人民解放军生产成绩辉煌
    上半年已耕地三百三十三万余亩
    不避任何艰苦发挥高度劳动热忱
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国人民解放军今年开展的大规模生产建设运动，已获致辉煌的成就。自去年十二月五日毛主席所发布的军队参加生产建设的命令后，各地解放军即在不妨碍军事任务、保卫国防、肃清土匪、巩固治安、加强整训等条件下，执行了劳动生产、长期建设的方针，根据驻地条件制定生产计划，从事农业、水利事业、各种建筑工程及手工业等生产。
    变荒原漠野为良田努力争取好的收成
    半年来，人民解放军在农业生产方面已耕土地达三百三十三万八千余亩。其中以新疆军区部队的垦种成绩尤为显著。该军区部队在祖国边疆天山南北的荒原漠野上，耕种土地达八十万亩，超过原订计划的百分之三十三。中南地区的第四野战军某部于作战任务甫毕，于三月间离中南地区，经月余行军返回东北进行生产，在北满大平原和松花江、辽河两岸垦地达五十二万亩。现各地部队正紧张进行锄草、拔苗，为争取好的收成而努力。
    广泛进行兴修水利挖河修渠工程浩大
    与开展农业生产的同时，各部解放军广泛地进行了兴修水利的工作。西北军区部队修筑整理了可灌田百余万亩的新旧水渠。华北军区部队于六月下旬完成包修海河、滦河、桑乾河等二十多条河流的水利工程共一千一百万土方以上，不仅增加了农田灌溉的便利，而且使沿岸人民生命财产有了相当的保障。西南军区某部于今年一月间，担任可灌田三百五十万亩的灌县都江堰的岁修工程，于四月二日完工放水，整修时间较去年缩短五十五天，整修费用较去年节省五分之三。其他军区部队也在驻地进行了修堤、疏浚河流等大小规模的各种水利工程。
    投入巨大交通工程积极修建公路铁路
    各部解放军并以大量劳动力投入交通建设。西北军区部队数万人包修全长七百一十公里的陇海铁路天（水）宝（鸡）段的整修和天（水）兰（州）段的建筑工程，已完成二百三十余万立方公尺的土石方工程。西南军区部队一部包修过去酝酿四十多年而终未完成的全长五百三十公里的成渝铁路，已于六月十六日动工，预计明年年底可全线通车。青海驻军在严寒下，修建西宁至玉树全长八百二十公里的公路，现已修抵鄂拉山，计长三百四十六公里。新疆驻军亦正在沙漠、荒山地区修建长达数千里的公路线。其他各地部队很多都包修了公路、铁路、桥梁和其他建设工程。
    根据驻地实际情况从事各种工矿副业
    除上述主要生产项目外，各地区的部队尚根据驻地实际情况，从事各种工业、手工业、采矿业和副业生产。西北军区部队经营的畜牧业已得到了相当的成绩，据不完全统计，已饲养牛六千三百余头，羊十三万六千余只，猪二万六千余口，马一万余匹。
    由于人民解放军绝大部分来自劳动人民中间，具有各种生产经验和高度的劳动热忱，因此在生产建设运动中表现出不避任何艰难困苦辛勤劳作的精神。西北军区的指挥员们提出“安下心，扎下根，半耕半读，勤劳建设大西北”的口号，积极从事生产建设。青海修路部队于零下十四度的严寒下，在空气稀薄、呼吸困难的鄂拉山区积极修路。新疆军区某工兵团在零下二十度的严冬季节里，在结冻一公尺厚的玛纳斯河上展开修桥工程，以四个月零二十天的时间，提前完成预定要半年时间的玛纳斯河大桥。第四野战军回东北生产的部队在冰天雪地中，展开了大规模的生产准备工作，因而有了开荒五十二万亩的巨大成绩。其他各地区部队也都表现了积极完成任务的艰苦奋斗的精神。此外，人民解放军各部并积极帮助驻地群众进行劳动生产，协同全国人民医治长期战争遗留下来的创伤，推进新中国的经济建设事业。
