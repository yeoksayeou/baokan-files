    Changjiang shipping has only existed for a few decades. Under the monopoly and squeeze of imperialist powers infringing on China's inland river navigation rights, it has gradually approached its end. According to statistics, in 1936, the total tonnage of Chinese and foreign ships sailing on the Yangtze River route was more than 300,000 tons, of which foreign ships accounted for two-thirds of the total tonnage. After Chiang Kai-shek's gang once again sold inland river navigation rights to American imperialism on November 4, 1946, the small steamship industry run by national capitalists was defeated. Only a few companies run by bureaucratic capital or relying on bureaucratic capital could "barely survive." Now the years of suffering are over, the people have turned over, and the Yangtze River has also turned over. The recovery and development of the shipping industry already has good conditions.
    On the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 576,000 tons of Jianghai ships in the country. A total of 112 public and private ships, totaling 112,495 tons, sailed on the Yangtze River route. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, from the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai to the retreat from Wuhan, most of the ships sailing on the Yangtze River were robbed and destroyed by the Japanese invaders, or sunk by the Kuomintang army. A total of 87 ships, totaling more than 110,000 tons, were sunk in major ports such as Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Longtan, Jiangyin, and Madang. More than 300,000 tons were looted and destroyed by the Japanese invaders. At that time, only more than 100,000 tons of ships sailed into the Chuanjiang River. Four-fifths of them were damaged. The China Merchants Bureau originally had more than 86,000 tons of ships. After retreating to Chongqing in April 1943, only 18 broken ships, totaling more than 23,000 tons, remained. Those damaged accounted for 62.7% of the total tonnage. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, these surviving ships retreated to a very short voyage within the Chuanjiang River, and the ships running to the Chuanjiang River had to have a special structure: large horsepower, flat bottom, with double rudders and double propellers. The tonnage of the ship cannot exceed 1,200 tons. The six large ships of the China Merchants Bureau lacked the above conditions and could not sail in the Chuanjiang River, so they could only continue to operate with ships that were less than one-tenth of the total tonnage. At this time, the Minsheng Company, which mainly ran the Chuanjiang River, was greatly developed. After Japan surrendered, the official China Merchants Bureau received many enemy and puppet ships. By the end of September 1947, the bureau's ships had suddenly increased to 466, totaling more than 326,800 tons. At this time, Minsheng Company also expanded its business due to "victorious return, crowded passengers and goods." However, because three-quarters of the tonnage was conscripted by the Chiang gang for military transportation at low prices, it suffered heavy losses every month. As of July 1948, Minsheng Company had about 130 ships of various sizes (95 steamships), 72,000 tons, including 4 ships moored in Hong Kong, more than 15,000 tons, 3 ships in the Liberated Areas, 2,121 tons, and more than 100 ships, 60,000 tons, on the Chuanjiang line. Due to the oppression of bureaucratic capital, except for the Sanbei, Datong, and Dada Joint Transportation Office, which had more than 10,000 tons each and could barely maintain, most of the other small companies were in a state of shutdown. The total number of ships sailing on the Chuanjiang line was only more than 120.
    In the eight months before liberation, most of these shipping companies had already suspended operations and were heavily indebted. The Chiang gang carried out large-scale destruction before the defeat of Jing, Hu and Han. The China Merchants Bureau alone was destroyed and sunk four large ships near Hankou, totaling more than 11,000 tons. The three ships left by the China Merchants Bureau in the ports of Hankou and Chongqing, plus the five ships received from the puppet navy, plus the "Jianghan" which was recently completed in Hankou, totaled only more than 6,500 tons. The Minsheng Company left only 77 ships in various places on the Chuanjiang line, totaling more than 34,000 tons. They are all smaller coal and oil tankers. At present, only more than 12,000 tons can be sailed. The two companies have a total of only more than 18,000 tons of ships sailing in the Chuanjiang River.
    After the liberation of Hankou and Chongqing, the People's Government provided various support to the shipping companies in order to enable them to resume operations quickly, by means of loans, advance payment of freight, and allocation of cargo. In March, the Southwest Shipping Administration Bureau also led seven small companies including Xiechang, Huafu, Xingye, Maotai, Taiji, Jiyun, and Kaihua to discuss ways to jointly manage their businesses in order to overcome the serious difficulties left by the Chiang gang. From January to the end of May, the Chongqing branch of the People's Bank of China allocated another 9.33 billion yuan in loans, which were lent to Minsheng, Qianghua, Hezhong, Huazhong, Huafu, Yongchang, Yujiang, and ferry companies in installments under contract for the exclusive purpose of purchasing coal, oil, and repairing ships.
    In the first half of this year, shipping became busy because of the task of transporting Sichuan grain to the east. The start of Sichuan grain transportation coincided with the dry season in February and March. Especially in the section from Chongqing to Yichang, ships with slightly larger tonnage could not travel. The monthly transportation volume was less than 16,000 tons. Including the transportation of wooden ships, by May, more than 30,000 tons of materials and grain had been transported out. During this period of transportation tension, two difficult problems occurred: First, in addition to grain, Sichuan's export goods also included a large quantity of bristles, tung oil, salt, sugar, etc. In order to adjust Sichuan's finances, it is necessary to take into account the transportation. In addition, there are thousands of merchants who have registered to leave Sichuan, so there is a phenomenon that Chuanjiang ships cannot meet the demand. But another difficulty is that the upstream cargo in Hankou and Yichang is only about 10-20% of the downstream cargo. Some ships not only have to return empty, but even spend money in Yichang to hire workers to load sand and stones into the ship for ballast, and then hire people to remove the sand and stones in Sichuan, resulting in heavy losses. In May, the Changjiang River Shipping Bureau held a shipping conference to solve this problem: As for the distribution of downstream cargo, food grain is the main priority, and a considerable tonnage is reserved for general commodities and passengers every month; As for the upstream cargo problem, the Sichuan Grain Group will make a reasonable distribution and allocate it in proportion to the amount of Sichuan grain transported by the shipping companies. The shipping companies unanimously supported this decision.
    At present, some shipping companies are not active enough in business management, and they still have the mistaken idea of ​​simply relying on the government. Taking the Minsheng General Company as an example: on the one hand, it complains that it is "losing money and cannot maintain operations," and asks the government for loans and support, and asks the government to "persuade workers to reduce wages"; on the other hand, it raises the salaries of senior employees. The monthly salary expenses of employees account for 63% of the company's total expenses. The electricity bill in the employees' dormitory exceeds one-half of the public electricity bill. The lower-level employees cannot even live in houses, but there are many senior staff who receive dry salaries, with more than 80 consultants, 17 inspectors, and 8 commissioners, etc. In February and March, the company proposed to reduce workers' wages by five pounds of meat. The workers demanded public accounts and "start with the senior staff, and first reduce those who receive dry salaries." But the company threatened the workers and said: "Reducing meat is an administrative issue and you cannot interfere!" The workers protested: "This is a welfare issue and you are violating the CPPCC program." The dispute formed a deadlock. If the shipping industry does not first improve this unreasonable system, it is impossible to persuade workers to reduce wages. Only by establishing the concept of self-reliance, overcoming pessimistic psychology, and reforming the bloated organization can shipowners overcome difficulties and move towards the bright future of people's shipping with the support of government loans and regulation of transportation supply and demand.

　　川江航运
    江横
    长江航业，历史不过几十年，在帝国主义侵犯我国内河航行权的垄断排挤下，已渐趋绝境。据统计，一九三六年行驶长江线的中外轮船共有三十余万吨，其中外轮即占总吨数的三分之二。蒋介石匪徒于一九四六年十一月四日，再度出卖内河航行权给美帝国主义后，民族资本家经营的小轮船业便都被打垮了。只有官僚资本或依靠官僚资本经营的少数公司，还能“苟延残喘”。现在苦难的岁月已经终结，人民翻了身，长江也翻了身。航业的恢复和发展已经有了良好的条件了。
    在抗战前夕，全国江海轮船共有五十七万六千余吨，行驶在长江线的公私轮船共一一二艘，计十一万二千四百九十五吨。抗战期间，从京沪沦陷到武汉撤退，行驶在长江内的轮船，大部被日寇劫夺破坏，或被国民党军队凿沉。在上海、镇江、龙潭、江阴、马当等要港被凿沉的轮船和趸船（轮船靠码头时上下客商所用），共有八十七艘，计十一万余吨。被日寇掳劫和炸毁者达三十余万吨。当时，驶入川江的船只只有十万多吨。其中五分之四都损毁了。招商局原有轮船八万六千余吨，到一九四三年四月撤到重庆后仅仅残留下十八艘破船，计二万三千多吨。被损毁者占总吨数的百分之六二点七。抗战时期，这些残存的船只，都退缩到川江极短的航程以内，而跑到川江的轮船却要有特别的构造：马力大，船底平，具有双舵和双推进器。船的吨位又不能超过一千二百吨。招商局的六只大轮船，缺乏上述条件，不能在川江行驶，只能以不足总吨数十分之一的船只继续营业。这时以跑川江为主的民生公司，却大大得到发展。日本投降以后，官办的招商局，接收了很多敌伪船舶，截至一九四七年九月底，该局的船舶突增到四百六十六艘，计三十二万六千八百多吨。民生公司在这时也因为“胜利复员、客货拥挤”，业务较前也有扩充。但因四分之三的吨位被蒋匪低价征作军运，每月亏损很大。截至一九四八年七月，民生公司约有大小船只一百三十多艘（轮船计九十五艘），七万二千吨，计泊香港的四艘、一万五千多吨，在解放区的三艘、二千一百二十一吨，在川江线的一百多艘、六万多吨。其他小轮船业，因官僚资本的压迫，除三北、大通、大达联营运输处各有万余吨能勉力维持外，其他小公司大多陷于停业状态，航行在川江线上的船只总计不过一百二十多艘。
    解放前八个月内，这些轮船公司大多已经停航，而且均负债累累。蒋匪在京、沪、汉溃败前又大肆破坏，仅招商局在汉口附近就被破坏击沉大船四艘，合计一万一千多吨。招商局在汉口、重庆港岸残留的三只船，加上接收伪海军部的五只船，再加上最近在汉口修竣的“江汉”号，共计不过六千五百多吨。民生公司遗留在川江线各地的只有七十七艘，计三万四千余吨。且都是较小型的煤轮和油轮。目前能行驶的也仅有一万二千多吨。两公司行驶川江的船只，合计也仅一万八千多吨。
    汉口、重庆解放以后，人民政府为使各轮船公司迅速复航，曾以贷款预付运费和配载的办法，给予种种扶植。三月份，西南航政局并领导协昌、华孚、兴业、懋泰、泰记、济运、凯华等七家小公司商讨了合力经营办法，以度过蒋匪所遗留下的严重困难。一月到五月底人民银行重庆分行又拨出贷款九十三亿三千万元，以订契约方式分期贷给民生、强华、合众、华中、华孚、永昌、渝江及轮渡公司专用于购煤、购油、修理船只。
    今年上半年，因为有了川粮东运的任务，航运就显得繁忙。川粮运输的开始，适在二、三月间枯水时期，尤其是重庆到宜昌一段吨位稍大的船不能行驶，每月运输量不到一万六千吨，加上木船的运输，到五月份，已运出物资与粮食超过了三万吨。在这个运输紧张的阶段，发生了两个困难问题：第一，四川出口的物资，除了粮食外尚有猪鬃、桐油、盐、糖等数量亦很多。为了调剂四川的金融，必须兼顾疏运。此外，尚有出川客商登记的达数千人，川江船舶，遂有供不应求的现象。但另一困难是上水船在汉口，宜昌的上水货仅及下水货一二成左右，有的船非特要空放回去，甚至为压舱的需要，在宜昌花了钱雇工将沙石装入船中，到四川后再雇人将沙石起出，因而亏蚀很多。五月份长江区航务局曾召开航务会议，解决这一问题：关于下水货的分配，以食粮为主，一般商品及旅客则每月保留相当的吨位搭载；关于上水货问题，由川粮小组作合理的分配，并按照轮船公司运输川粮的多寡作比例分摊。航商方面对这样的决定，表示一致拥护。
    现在，若干航商对于业务经营是不够积极，而且思想上还存有单纯依赖政府的错误观念。以民生总公司为例：一方面叫苦“赔钱，维持不了”，要求政府贷款扶植，要求政府“说服工人减低薪资”；另一方面却又提高高级职员的薪资。每月员工薪资开支要占公司总支出的百分之六十三。职员宿舍里的电费，每月要超过公用电费的二分之一以上。下级员工们却连房子都住不到，领干薪的高级人员却很多，有八十多个顾问、十七个视察、八个专员等等。二、三月间，公司曾提出减低工薪五斤肉，工人们要求公开账目，并且“先从高级职员减起，先减掉那些领干薪的人”。公司却威胁工人说：“减肉是行政问题，你们不能干涉！”工人则抗议说：“这是福利问题，你们违反政协纲领。”纠纷曾形成了僵局。航业界如不先改善这种不合理的制度，是不可能说服工人减低工资的。航商们只有确立起自力更生的观念，克服消极悲观心理，改革臃肿的机构，才能在政府贷款、调剂运输供求的扶植下，度过困难，走向人民航业的光明前途。
