Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: The "Provisional Measures for Issuing and Distributing Screening Licenses for New Films," "Clearance of Old Films," "Export of Domestic Films," and "Import of Foreign Films," formulated by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, have been approved by the Government Administration Council and announced on the 11th.

            Issuance of Screening Licenses

The Provisional Measures for Issuing Screening Licenses for New Films stipulate that all film production enterprises that have been registered and approved by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government are exempt from review for their newly produced films and their scripts. After the film is produced, the applicant shall fill out a film production registration form with two copies of the synopsis and submit it to the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency for registration before the film is distributed or screened, and apply for a national screening license (valid for two years, which may be renewed upon expiration). After the screening license is issued, it can be screened throughout the country. Cinemas and projection teams in all regions shall not screen any film without a screening license. If the content of the film, when screened, is reported to be in conflict with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the cultural and educational authorities of the central direct-controlled provinces and municipalities or major administrative regions shall review the facts and report to the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government to decide on the handling method; local authorities at all levels shall not prohibit the screening of the film on their own.

            Clearance of Old Films

The Provisional Measures for Clearing Old Films stipulate that all Chinese and foreign films that have been screened and imported shall be regarded as old films. If the content of old films is anti-world peace, anti-people's democracy, violates the interests of the Chinese nation, or promotes obscenity, pornography, superstition, terror, etc., which is sufficient to hinder the new social order, it may be censored or prohibited from screening depending on the severity of the circumstances. All film production enterprises that have been registered and approved by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government shall apply to the Film Review Committee of the Central Film Bureau for review of their old films; after the review is passed, a national screening license will be issued. Old films in provinces and municipalities directly under the central government shall be reviewed by the Film Review Committee of the Central Film Bureau; old films in major administrative regions shall be reviewed separately by the Old Film Review Committee established by the cultural and educational authorities of each region. After passing the review, a national or regional screening license may be issued depending on the circumstances (valid for one year, which may be renewed upon expiration). The issuance of a national screening license must be approved by the Film Review Committee of the Central Film Bureau. If the content of the film is reported and the review agency deems it necessary, it may be re-reviewed at any time. All old films must have a screening license to be screened. Cinemas and projection teams in all regions shall not screen any film without a screening license.

            Export of Domestic Films

The Provisional Measures for Exporting Domestic Films stipulate that for the export of films by registered and approved film industries, the applicant shall fill out an application form with two copies of the synopsis, together with the complete film, and submit it to the Film Review Committee of the Central Film Bureau for review; after the review is passed, a foreign distribution license will be issued (valid for two years, which may be renewed upon application for review). With the license, the applicant shall go through the export procedures with the foreign trade management agency. If the Central Film Bureau believes that the film should be encouraged, it may apply for tax reduction or exemption on its behalf. After the film is exported, the foreign exchange earned from its distribution shall be settled in accordance with the foreign exchange management regulations of the People's Bank of China, and the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency shall be responsible for certification. If the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency deems it necessary, it may consult with the national bank to provide foreign exchange collateral or export loans. If the film exporter is a film production enterprise that is continuing production, and needs to order supplementary equipment from abroad for production needs, it may prepare a budget and, after certification by the Central Film Bureau, apply to the local foreign trade management agency and the national bank for approval of foreign exchange and import permits. When exporting a film, the applicant may entrust the foreign agency of the Central Film Bureau to distribute it, or the applicant may distribute it independently, or the film holder may apply to sell the foreign copyright. However, independent distribution must be registered with the foreign agency of the Central Film Bureau, and the foreign exchange earnings from foreign distribution must be reported to the agency at any time. The agency has the right to investigate and verify. If the declared foreign exchange settlement does not match the facts and is intentionally evaded, and the investigation proves to be true, the applicant's right to apply for the export of future products may be suspended, and the evaded portion shall be handled in accordance with the relevant regulations on handling foreign exchange evasion in the foreign exchange management regulations of the People's Bank of China. The sale of foreign copyrights must be declared in writing to the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency, stating the screening area, term, price, and the name of the recipient, in order to verify the amount of foreign exchange settlement. If the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency deems it necessary, the state-owned film management company may give priority to acquiring it under the same conditions. When exporting films, whether they are film "prints," soundtracks, or duplicate soundtracks, except for entrusted distribution, a reputable guarantor must be found before export to ensure that they fulfill all responsibilities for film export.

            Import of Foreign Films

The Provisional Measures for Importing Foreign Films stipulate that film industries that have been registered and approved, if applying to import foreign films or Chinese films produced in Hong Kong and other foreign places, shall fill out an import application form and, after being approved by the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency, transfer it to the foreign trade management agency for the issuance of an import permit, which shall be used as the basis for import. After import, an application form for film review shall be filled out, together with the complete film, two copies each of the synopsis in Chinese and the original dialogue script, and documents such as customs duty payment certificates, and submitted to the Film Review Committee of the Central Film Bureau or the agency entrusted by the Central Film Bureau for review; after the review is passed, a national screening license will be issued (valid for two years, which may be renewed upon application for review). For imported films, if the content is anti-world peace, anti-people's democracy, violates the interests of the Chinese nation, or promotes obscenity, pornography, superstition, terror, etc., which is sufficient to hinder the new social order, it shall be censored or not approved depending on the severity of the circumstances. Film review agencies may re-review films that have already passed the review when necessary. Applications for importing films shall be limited to printed "copies." Other items such as film soundtracks or duplicate soundtracks shall not be applied for import unless specially permitted by the Central Film Bureau or its entrusted agency. For Chinese films or other foreign films produced abroad, the state-owned film management company may purchase its domestic distribution rights in foreign exchange after being approved by the Central Film Bureau. If the above-mentioned films are distributed in China by the film studio or its agent, the revenue from the distribution shall not be settled into foreign exchange. All screenings of imported films must have a screening license; cinemas and projection teams in all regions shall not screen any film without a screening license.
