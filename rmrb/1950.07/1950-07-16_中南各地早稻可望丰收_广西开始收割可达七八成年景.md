　　Early Rice Harvests in Central South Regions Expected to be Bumper
    Guangxi Begins Harvesting, Expected to Reach 70-80% of Normal Years
    [Hankou News] Changjiang Daily News: Early rice in Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan and other places is about to be harvested.
    In Tonghaikou District, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, the "Honggu" rice in all villages has fully headed, some of which is already half-ripe and will soon be harvested. In addition, in fifty-three villages in the Seventh District of the county, the "Mangzaizi" and "Touhuzao" early rice varieties have all headed. The early rice fields in this district are estimated to be about 10,000 mu. In order to strive for two seasons of planting on the early rice fields, farmers have now begun sowing late rice seeds. To solve the problem of seed shortage for farmers, the Seventh District People's Government has loaned out 25,000 jin of food rice and allocated it to various villages for exchanging late rice seeds.
    In some areas of Ji'an, Taihe, and Yugan counties in Jiangxi Province, early rice has already headed. In various villages of the Zhixia District, Ji'an County, and various villages of the Xinshi District, Taihe County, early rice has generally headed and can be harvested in half a month. The "Wushizao" rice in Yugan County has also generally headed and will soon be harvested. The "Wushizao" variety is sown more than ten days before Qingming Festival, and rice seedlings are transplanted around the Start of Summer. The seedlings can be harvested after about fifty days in the fields. According to farmers, this year's harvest is not bad, and harvesting can be done in more than twenty days; one rice ear contains over a hundred grains, and generally around eighty grains.
    In Changsha, Hunan and other places, early rice has begun to head, and farmers are very happy. This year's early rice seedlings are relatively good. If there are no unexpected natural disasters, a good harvest can be expected.
    [Our Newspaper News] Guangxi Province achieved good results in spring plowing this year. This spring, the province has sown a total of 19,660,000 mu of rice and miscellaneous grains, accounting for 80% of the province's total cultivated land area.
    Various parts of the province have begun harvesting early rice since late June. According to general farmers' estimates, this year's early rice harvest may exceed last year, averaging 70-80% of a normal year. Except for the early rice in Nanning and Yuning Special Districts, which was reduced by 10-20% due to lack of rain and late transplanting, the early rice in Guilin, Liuzhou, Pingle, Yishan, Wuming, and Wuzhou districts is growing well; a bumper harvest is expected in Xing'an, Quanxian, Guanyang, and Tengxian areas.
    This year's spring plowing in the province was carried out under the circumstances of combating bandit disturbances and overcoming difficulties such as food and seed shortages. In the early stage of spring plowing, most middle peasants did not actively produce because they did not understand the policies of the People's Government. At the same time, the infringement of the interests of middle peasants in the grain lending movement in some areas increased their concerns, and their production enthusiasm was quite low. Some poor and hired peasants were not active in production because they had the idea of ​​relying on relief, thinking that the government would not allow people to starve to death anyway. After the leading organs understood this situation, they actively carried out education on production policies, corrected the tendency to infringe on the interests of middle peasants, vigorously carried out the rent reduction and rent refund movement, overcame the difficulties of food and seed shortages, and improved farmers' production enthusiasm. In areas where policies were well implemented, farmers achieved more processing and fertilization, deep plowing, and careful cultivation. For example, Liulian Village in Lingchuan did not burn lime last year, but this year it burned five to six hundred dan, and fertilizer was generally increased; some paddy fields have undergone three plowing and three harrowing. In areas where public security was unstable, farmers' associations and militia implemented sentry duty and checkpoints, and armed protection of spring plowing. Now, not only have the middle peasants settled down to production, but some landlords who do not usually work are also working in the fields. Opium addicts, gamblers, and idlers in Longzhou and other places have also joined the production upsurge.

### 中南各地早稻可望丰收  广西开始收割可达七八成年景

　　中南各地早稻可望丰收
    广西开始收割可达七八成年景
    【汉口讯】长江日报消息：目前湖北、江西、湖南等地早稻即将收割。
    湖北沔阳县通海口区各村的“红谷”，已全部出穗，有的已经一半熟，很快即可开始收割。又该县七区五十三个村，“芒早籽”、“头湖早”二种早稻，穗已全部出齐。该区早稻田约计一万亩左右，农民为争取早稻田种二季，现已开始播晚谷种。七区人民政府为解决农民缺种困难，已贷出二万五千斤食米，配拨各村作为调换晚稻种之用。
    江西吉安、泰和、余干等县有的地区，早稻已抽穗。吉安县值夏区新圩乡各村，泰和县信实区各村早禾已普遍抽穗，再过半月即可收割。余干县的“五十早”也已普遍抽穗，即将收割。按“五十早”系在清明前十多天下种，至立夏插秧栽禾，禾苗在田内经过五十天左右即可收割。据农民谈，今年收成不坏，再有二十多天就可割禾；一枝禾穗有含籽达百数十粒的，一般的也都在八十粒左右。
    湖南长沙等地，早稻开始抽穗，农民欢喜异常。今年早稻禾苗较好，如无意外天灾，就可以有一个好收成。
    【本报讯】广西省今年春耕工作成绩良好。今春全省共计播种水稻和杂粮一千九百六十六万亩，占全省总耕地面积百分之八十。
    该省各地从六月下旬起，已开始收割早稻。据一般农民估计，今年早稻收成可超过去年，平均可达七八成年景。除南宁、玉宁两专区的早稻因缺雨水，插秧过迟，减产一二成外，其余桂林、柳州、平乐、宜山、武鸣、梧州各区早稻生长良好；兴安、全县、灌阳、藤县一带可望丰收。
    该省今年春耕是在打击土匪扰乱、克服缺粮缺种等困难的情况下进行的。春耕初期，一般中农因不了解人民政府的政策，不敢积极生产，同时又因个别地区在借粮运动中侵犯了中农利益，更增加了中农的顾虑，生产情绪相当低落。部分贫雇农，因为存有依赖救济的思想，认为反正政府不许饿死人，生产也不积极。领导机关了解了这种情况后，即积极展开生产政策教育，纠正了侵犯中农的偏向，大力开展减租退租运动，克服缺粮缺种的困难，提高农民的生产情绪。政策执行得好的地区，农民都做到了加工加肥、深耕细作。如灵川六联村去年没有烧石灰，今年却烧了五六百担，普遍增加了肥料；部分水田都经过了三犁三耙。治安不靖的地方，农会民兵实行站岗守卡，武装保护春耕。现在不但中农已经安心生产，平日不事劳动的地主，有的也下田耕作。龙州等地的大烟鬼、赌徒，二流子也都卷入了生产热潮。
