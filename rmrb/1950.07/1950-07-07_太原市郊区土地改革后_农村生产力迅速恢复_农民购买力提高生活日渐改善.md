　　Taiyuan News, Shanxi Daily: After land reform in the rural areas of Taiyuan's suburbs, productivity has recovered rapidly, approaching pre-war levels. The land reform in the suburbs of Taiyuan began in November last year and concluded successfully before the spring plowing this year. A total of more than 551,000 mu of land owned by landlords was confiscated and distributed to more than 22,000 landless or land-poor farmers.

　　After the land reform ended, the People's Government devoted all its efforts to leading farmers in production and mobilized former military and government personnel remaining in the city to participate in production in the suburbs. The Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank also issued agricultural loans of more than 300 million yuan to help farmers who had undergone land reform solve their difficulties. Farmers newly purchased 2,000 head of draft animals and more than 2,700 pieces of farm implements, which greatly increased rural productivity in the suburbs and quickly approached pre-war levels, with some villages exceeding pre-war levels. For example, Huangling Village increased its labor force by more than 330 people, exceeding more than half of the pre-war level of 575 people, and increased its livestock by more than 30 head, exceeding the pre-war level of 20 head; Guanjia Village had 22 head of livestock before the war, and now it has increased to 62 head.

　　After farmers obtained land and purchased livestock and farm implements, their enthusiasm for production was extremely high. In the past three months, farmers in the suburbs have eliminated 11,250 mu of wasteland. In addition to repairing the five irrigation canals destroyed by the Yan bandit troops, two new irrigation canals were built this spring with the help of loans from the Water Conservancy Bureau. At the same time, 282 waterwheels were purchased, and the irrigated area increased by 19,000 mu compared to pre-war levels. The amount of fertilizer applied has also reached pre-war levels, averaging 30 dan per mu. In Xiaomai Village, Fourth District, the average fertilizer application was 30 dan per mu before the war, and now it averages 40 dan per mu; in Jiajie, Yangjiabao and other villages with a long history of production, the average is 60 dan per mu. A total of 270,000 mu of summer wheat was planted in the suburbs this year, and the area sown to wheat was expanded by a quarter compared to last year. Because of favorable weather and abundant rainfall this spring and the increased use of fertilizer, farmers in all villages are celebrating a bumper harvest.

　　After the land reform, the lives of farmers have improved significantly. According to statistics from the Huangling Administrative Village Cooperative, the total sales in April reached 10.1 million yuan, and increased to 15.82 million yuan in May. In Jiajie Village, more than 100 households had nine new houses built and twenty houses repaired after the land reform, and there were thirteen marriages. Wu Yinghai, an old poor peasant in the village who had lived a single life for more than fifty years, also became a groom in April this year. According to statistics from the Third District Government of the city's suburbs, after the land reform, 604 pairs of farmers applied for marriage registration.

　　太原市郊区土地改革后
    农村生产力迅速恢复
    农民购买力提高生活日渐改善
    【太原讯】山西日报消息：土地改革后的太原市郊区农村，生产力迅速恢复，已接近战前水平。太原市郊区从去年十一月实行土地改革，至今年春耕前胜利结束，共没收了地主土地五十五万一千余亩，分配给二万二千余无地或少地的农民。
    土地改革结束后，人民政府即全力领导农民进行生产，并发动留在市内的旧军政人员到郊区参加生产。人民银行太原分行，亦发放了三万万余元的农业贷款，帮助土改后的农民解决困难。农民们新购耕畜两千头、农具两千七百余件，使郊区农村生产力激增，迅速接近战前水平，部分村庄已超过了战前水平。如黄陵村即增加劳力三百三十余人，超过战前五百七十五人的一半以上，增加畜力三十余头，超过战前二十头；观家峪战前有牲口二十二头，现在增加到六十二头。
    农民得到土地并购买了牲畜、农具后，生产情绪极高。三个月来郊区农民共消灭荒地一万一千二百五十亩。除修复阎匪破坏了的五道水渠外，今春在水利局贷款帮助下，又新修水渠两条，同时购买了水车二百八十二辆，浇地面积比战前增加一万九千亩。施肥量亦已达到战前水平，每亩地平均已达三十担。四区小麦沟村战前每亩施肥三十担，现在每亩平均四十担；生产一向有基础的嘉节、杨家堡等村每亩平均达六十担。郊区今年共种宿麦二十七万亩，种麦面积比去年扩大四分之一。因为今春风调雨顺，施肥又多，各村农民都喜庆丰收。
    土地改革以后，农民生活已显著提高。据黄陵行政村合作社的统计：四月份销货总额达一千零一十万元，五月份增加到一千五百八十二万元。嘉节村共一百多户人家，土改后新盖房子的有九户，修理房子的有二十户，结婚的有十三户。该村老贫农吴英海，过了五十多年独身生活，今年四月间也做了新郎。据市郊三区区政府统计：土地改革后，声请登记结婚的农民有六百零四对。
