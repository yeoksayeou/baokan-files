Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou Telegram: The cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have developed more than thirteenfold in the past year, playing a significant role in connecting urban and rural areas and solving the production and livelihood difficulties of farmers and herdsmen. According to statistics, from May of last year to April 21st of this year, the number of cooperatives in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has increased from 56 to 741; the funds have increased from over 7.96321 billion yuan (Mongolian currency, currency value the same as Northeast currency) to over 123.77943 billion yuan in cash alone. Last year, the goods purchased and sold by the cooperatives generally reached 20 percent of the purchasing power of the people of Inner Mongolia. In the first quarter of this year, the total supply and marketing volume of the Morin Dawa Banner Cooperative in the Hulunbuir League reached 51 percent of the purchasing power of the entire banner.

	In the past year, cooperatives in various parts of Inner Mongolia cooperated with agricultural production to promote seeds and agricultural implements. Some cooperatives provided loans of grain to help farmers solve food shortages; in addition, some cooperatives organized sideline production to cooperate with disaster relief. Furthermore, some cooperatives also signed contracts with herdsmen for the pre-purchase of cattle and sheep, reducing the excessive intermediary exploitation suffered by herdsmen from private merchants. Many cooperatives, during the busy farming seasons of sowing and summer hoeing this year, transported goods deep into the countryside, facilitating purchases for farmers and herdsmen, which was very popular.

	Because Inner Mongolian cooperatives have solved practical difficulties for the people, their credibility has gradually been established. More and more people are asking to buy shares. For example, the number of shareholders in the United Cooperative of Zheng and Xiangbai Banners in Chahar League has expanded to 1,432 households (each household is one member), accounting for 95 percent of the total number of households.

　　内蒙合作事业迅速发展
    一年内社数增加十三倍以上
    【新华社张家口电】内蒙自治区的合作社，一年来发展了十三倍以上，在沟通城乡关系和解决农、牧民生产生活困难等方面起了很大作用。据统计：从去年五月至今年四月二十一日，内蒙自治区各地合作社已由五十六个发展到七百四十一个；资金由七十九亿六千三百二十一万余元（蒙币，币值同东北币），增加到仅现金即达一千二百三十七亿七千九百四十三万余元。去年合作社购销的货物，一般已达到内蒙人民购买力的百分之二十。今年第一季度，呼纳盟莫力达瓦旗合作社供销总额已达到全旗人民购买力百分之五十一。
    去年一年中内蒙各地合作社曾配合农业生产，推销了种籽和农具。有的合作社贷粮帮助农民解决粮荒；另外有些合作社组织了副业生产配合救灾。此外，有的合作社并与牧民订立预购牛羊的合同，减轻了牧民们受私商过重的中间剥削。很多合作社在今年农忙播种与夏锄时，运货深入农村，便利农、牧民购买，很受欢迎。
    内蒙合作社由于给人民解决了实际困难，其信用已日渐建立起来。要求入股的越来越多，如察盟正、厢白旗联合社入股户数已扩大到一千四百三十二户（每户为一社员），占总户数百分之九十五。
