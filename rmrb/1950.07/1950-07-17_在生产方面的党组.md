　　Party Groups in Production
    Organizer of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Committee of the Turi City Machine Building Factory in the Soviet Union, Danilinko
    In the struggle to successfully complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan and to educate workers with communism, party groups in production play a significant role. Party groups can ensure that all staff in the workshop are influenced by the Party and led by it. The strength of the party group lies in its ability to further familiarize itself with the strengths and weaknesses of each individual, to quickly reflect all events in its workshop, to seize and promote all new and advanced things, and to promptly point out and eliminate shortcomings.
    Based on the working experience of the party organization in our factory, we are convinced that party groups play an important role in solving all the problems facing the enterprise. The party organization in our factory is divided into ninety-two party groups. Party groups have been established in workshops and departments that decide the fate of production plans and production tasks.
    The influence of the party group in the work process of the workshop, factory, and the entire enterprise can be illustrated by these examples: The party group in the rolling mill section of the Second Mechanical Workshop took the lead in the struggle for thrift and economy. Previously, when manufacturing rotors for textile machines, many galvanized iron sheets were used, and a lot of metal was wasted during manufacturing. Therefore, the communists proposed to use two pieces of iron when manufacturing the rotors, which resulted in a significant saving of metal.
    Not long ago, a new plan was adopted in the workshop. The party group carried out explanatory work to enable everyone to master the new plan as soon as possible. Communist Party members and non-Party workers put forward many valuable suggestions. Labor productivity has increased due to the implementation of these suggestions. Comrade Kulinkov, a communist cutter, saved some time in manufacturing rims by stopping the idling of the mother machine. Non-Party workers Comrades Uvarov and Savronov violated technical regulations in one of the initial manufacturing processes, which made the subsequent manufacturing process more difficult. This violation was eliminated, and strict supervision is now implemented to ensure compliance with technical procedures. The workers have begun to overfulfill the new plan.
    The work of another party group in the Second Mechanical Workshop—the pivot parts section party group—is also worth mentioning. The organizer of this party group is Comrade Satalov. The communists in the same department initiated a competition following the joint savings method of Likiya Garabelinikova and Fiodor Kuznechov. This new working method gained the support of everyone. First-class technician Comrade Lavrushin gave lectures to young workers on the specialization of machine savings. The department set out the obligation to save supplementary materials. In April and May, all workers already used the saved cutters and screws for one day.
    The communists in the repair section of the textile machine workshop, led by the party organizer Comrade Togarev, put forward many initiatives. They improved the repair work of the machines. Now the number of machines in the workshop that are idle due to damage has been greatly reduced. The party group has discussed the issue of electricity saving several times. According to the proposal of this party group, magnetic starters have been installed on many machines. Therefore, this department can save as much electricity per month as it needs for seven hours of work.
    How do our party groups arrange their activities? They meet at least once a week. At the meetings of the party group, the reports of party members on the implementation of the Party's assignments are discussed. Great attention is also paid to the issue of improving the political level of party members.
    Each party group pays attention to deeply studying economic issues. At the beginning of each month, they listen to the notices of senior technicians on new production tasks, explain the "difficult" areas that may be encountered in the execution of the tasks, and point out ways to overcome them. At the gatherings of the party groups, issues related to the completion of socialist obligations by each department and workshop are discussed.
    Each party group strives to ensure that communists not only complete or overfulfill the plan themselves, but also help backward workers and pass on their knowledge and experience to them. We can cite such an example. The party group in the spindle ring workshop of the textile machine factory guided workers to participate in the struggle to double the production of parts. As a result, this workshop achieved a high level of labor productivity. Only the section of lathe operator Mironov did not succeed. Comrade Sheremichev, who was in charge of the adjuster, helped this non-Party comrade. He personally went to the machine to advise the lathe operator to use the second cutter. Soon, the productivity on lathe operator Mironov's machine rose to the general level.
    Lively work and political education of the people are the basis of the activities of our party groups. We have agitators in each of our workshops. They constantly explain the policies of the Bolshevik Party to the workers, explain the tasks facing the factories, workshops, and sections, and inform them of events in the current domestic and international situation. In the mass political work carried out by the party groups, wall newspapers and various obvious mobilizations occupy an important position. All this promotes the further consolidation of the connection between the party group and the non-Party activists and the broad masses of workers.
    The success of the party group's work depends on the constant and qualified leadership of the party group. The party branch of the workshop party organization systematically checks the work of each party group, points out what they should do and what needs to be paid attention to currently. For a period of time, some senior technicians in the automatic hosiery machine factory did not fully support the initiatives of the party group. Comrade Davydov, the secretary of the workshop party organization, brought this matter up for discussion at the branch meeting. Later, the technicians' attitude towards the party group changed.
    The factory party committee pays great attention to the party groups. It regularly checks how the workshop party branch is guiding the work of the party groups and what assistance the branch has given to the party organizers. At the meetings of the party committee, the reports of the party groups are regularly heard. We strive to make the affirmative experience of individual party groups the property of the entire party organization of the factory.
    Among the party group organizers in our factory, there are many young people who have just started doing party work. They need constant help and systematic guidance. Taking this into consideration, the party committee organized a workshop on practical issues in party work, as in the previous year. The party committee also decided to convene a meeting of party organizers every two or three months to exchange experiences.
    We still have many shortcomings in leading the party groups. Some party groups are not active enough, do not delve into the details of production and life, do not react to the shortcomings in the work of their workshops in a timely manner, and do not pay attention to the political education of the workers.
    Not only the factory party committee is responsible for this matter, but also the station district committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Turi City. The district committee did not delve into the work of the party groups in the enterprise. Last year, the district committee experimented with listening to the reports of two party group organizers in our factory. This shows how detached the party committee is from the lower-level party organizations. During the discussion, the standing committee of the district committee noted that the party group that was considered backward in the preliminary draft of the meeting actually worked better than the party group that was considered a model. If the workers of the district committee often went to the factory and paid more attention to the work of the party group, this "confusion" would not have occurred.
    The achievements of our enterprise's work are largely due to the combat effectiveness and activity of the party groups. Constant care for the consolidation of the party groups is the most important task of the party committee.

　　在生产方面的党组
    苏联突里市机器建造工厂联共（布）党委会组织者  达尼林科
    在争取顺利地完成战后斯大林五年计划任务的斗争中，在争取以共产主义来教育劳动者的斗争中，生产中的党组具有很大的作用。党组能够使车间中一切工作人员受到党的影响并去领导他们。党组的力量就在于它能够进一步熟习每个人的优点及缺点，能够很快地反映自己车间中的一切事件，抓住和推广一切新的和先进的事物，适时地指出及铲除缺点。
    依据我们工厂里的党组织的工作经验，我们确信在解决企业所面对的一切问题的时候，党组都起着重要的作用。我们工厂里党的组织共分为九十二个党组。在决定生产计划及生产任务的命运的各车间、各部门中，都建立有党组。
    党组在车间、工场及整个企业工作过程中，表现了怎样的影响，可以由这些实例来说明：第二机械场辗压部的党组，首先揭起了争取节约的斗争。以前制造纺织机的旋转器时，要用许多镀锌的铁叶，制造时很多金属都作废。于是共产党员们提议当制造旋转器时改用两块铁，结果节省了大量金属。
    不久以前工场中采用了新计划。党组进行了解释工作，使大家尽快地掌握新计划。共产党员及非党工人们提出了许多宝贵的建议。劳动生产率因这些建议的实现而提高了。削截手共产党员库林科夫同志，在制造轮缘时，由于停止了母机的空转而抽出了一些时间。非党工人乌瓦罗夫和萨夫罗诺夫同志在制造的一个开始过程中违犯了技术规律，使以后的制造过程增加了困难。这种违犯的情况被铲除了，现在已经实行严格的监督，争取技术手续的遵守。工人们开始超额完成新计划了。
    第二机械场中的另外一个党组——枢轴零件部党组的工作，也是值得指出的。这个党组的组织者是萨塔洛夫同志。同部门的共产党员们，依照李基娅·加拉别里尼科娃及菲道尔·库兹涅错夫的联合节约方法发起了竞赛。这个新的劳动方法，获得了全体的支持。一等技师拉夫鲁辛同志对青年工人们讲解了关于节省机器的专门课程。该部订出节省补助材料的义务。在四、五两月份中，全体工人已经有一天用节省下来的削截器及螺旋工作了。
    纺织机器工场修理部的共产党员们，以党的组织者拓加列夫同志为首提出了许多倡议。他们改善了机器的修理工作。现在工场中因有损坏而搁置着的机器大大减少了。党组曾讨论了好几次关于节省电力的事情。依照这个党组的提议，在许多机器上设置了磁铁开动器。因此这个部门每月可节省该部门七小时工作所需的那样多的电力。
    我们的各党组是怎样安排自己的活动的呢？它们每周至少开一次会。在党组的会议上讨论党员们关于执行党的委任的报告。对于提高党员的政治水平问题，也予以很大的注意。
    各党组都注意深刻地钻研经济问题。每月初，他们听取高等技师关于新的生产任务的通知，说明在执行任务时可能遇到的“困难”地方，并指出克服的办法。在各党组的集会上，讨论有关各部及各车间完成社会主义义务的问题。
    各党组力使共产党员们不仅自己完成或超额完成计划，而且要帮助落后的工人，把自己的知识和经验转达给他们。我们可以举这样一个例子。纺织机工场的纺锤环车间中的党组，引导工人参加争取加倍扩大零件的生产的斗争。这个车间因而达到了高度的劳动生产率。只有旋工米罗诺夫那部分没有成功。担任调节员的共产党员涉列米契耶同志帮助了这位非党同志，他亲自到机器旁劝告旋工使用第二个削截器。很快地旋工米罗诺夫机器上的生产率就升到一般的水平。
    对人们的生气勃勃工作和政治教育，是我们各党组活动的基础。我们的每个车间中都有鼓动者。他们时时给工人们解释布尔塞维克党的政策，解释工厂、工场、车间面前的任务，告知他们现代国内外情势中的事件。在党组所进行的群众政治工作中，墙报及各种明显的鼓动占有重要的地位。这一切都促使党组与非党积极分子和广大工人群众的联系更加巩固。
    党组工作的成功，系于对党组经常的有资格的领导。工场党组织支部都是有步骤地检查各党组的工作，指给它们应该做什么以及当前必需注意的是什么。自动织袜机工场中某些高等技师，有一个时期不十分支持党组的发起。工场党组织书记达维多夫同志就把这件事提到支部会上来讨论。后来，技师们对党组的态度就改变了。
    工厂党委会对党组是很注意的。它经常检查工场党支部在怎样指导党组的工作以及支部对党组织者都给与了一些什么帮助。在党委会的会议上，正规地听取各党组的报告。我们力使个别党组的肯定经验，作为工厂整个党组织的财产。
    在我们工厂中的党组组织者之间，有许多年青的刚刚开始做党的工作的人。他们需要经常的帮助，需要有系统的指导。党委会考虑到这一点，依照去年的例子组织了党的工作中实际问题的讲习班。党委会还决定两三个月之间要召集一次党组织者的会议，来交换经验。
    在领导党组方面我们还有许多缺点。有一些党组表现得积极性不够，不深入到生产生活的各细节中去，反应自己车间工作中的缺点也不及时，不注意工人的政治教育。
    对这件事须负责任的不仅只是工厂党委会，而且还有联共（布）突里市的车站区委会。区委会没有深入到企业内党组的工作中来。去年区委会曾试验着听取我们厂中两个党组组织者的报告。由此即可看出，党委会是怎样地脱离了低级的党组织。在讨论时区委会的常委曾注意到了，在会议的预备草案中认为是落后的党组，事实上比被认为是模范的党组工作得还好，如果区委会的工作者时常到工厂去，更加注意党组的工作，则不至于发生这种“混乱”了。
    我们企业工作的成就，很多都系于党组的战斗性和积极性。对巩固党组的时刻关怀，是党委会最重要的任务。
