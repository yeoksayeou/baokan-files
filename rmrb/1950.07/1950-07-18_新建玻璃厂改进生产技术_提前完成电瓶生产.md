　　New Glass Factory Improves Production Technology
    Completes Battery Production Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Newspaper] Li Shan, the chairman of the trade union of the newly built glass factory, led the workers to complete twenty-five days' worth of work in nineteen days, saving twelve tons of coal. The factory recently received a batch of battery orders, some of which were for large batteries weighing more than twenty pounds. According to the original plan, completing this batch of large batteries would require a furnace of six cylinders of raw materials and twenty-five days for delivery. The union chairman pondered how to complete the task ahead of schedule and reduce costs. He finally came up with a solution: still use a furnace with six cylinders, but add one-half more, i.e., nine cylinders of raw materials, and do one-half more work. He told the factory director and fellow workers about this idea, and it was enthusiastically supported. The fellow workers further discussed specific measures: 1. The night shift furnace workers should ensure that the furnace temperature rises gradually and does not drop, so as to shorten the melting time the next day and start work earlier. 2. During manufacturing, everyone should be careful to avoid producing defective products. Under the leadership of Li Shan, the task was completed six days ahead of schedule.

　　新建玻璃厂改进生产技术
    提前完成电瓶生产
    【本报讯】新建玻璃厂工会主任李山带动工人，以十九天的时间完成了二十五天的工作，并节省十二吨煤。该厂日前接到一批电瓶订货，其中有一部分是做二十多斤重的大电瓶。按原订计划，完成这批大电瓶，需用一盘炉六缸的原料，二十五天交货。工会主任就捉摸如何能提前完成任务，又能减低成本。他终于想出了办法：仍用一盘炉六个缸；但多加二分之一即九缸的原料，多作二分之一的工作。他将此意见告诉了厂长和工友，受到了热烈拥护。工友们更讨论出具体办法是：一、夜班看炉工友应使炉温逐升不降，以使次日熔料时间减短，提早工作。二、制造时，每人都应切实小心，勿使产生废品。在李山带头工作下，提前六天完成了任务。
