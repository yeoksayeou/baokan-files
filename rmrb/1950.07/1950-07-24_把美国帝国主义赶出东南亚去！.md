　　Drive American Imperialism Out of Southeast Asia!
    Li Ang
    Because the Chinese people, after their great victory, are preparing to cross the sea to liberate Taiwan; because the army of the Korean People's Republic has crushed the provocations of the Li Seung-man gang and is victoriously attacking southwards; because the armed struggles of the people of Southeast Asian countries are developing and growing stronger day by day, especially the people's armed struggles in Vietnam and the Philippines which have shaken the foundations of the reactionary puppet regimes; therefore, American imperialism is jumping over the wall like a cornered dog, revealing its vicious and sinister true face. Truman has publicly issued a shameless statement, implementing the dispatch of troops to attack the Korean people, armed aggression against Taiwan, and the strengthening of internal interference in Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries. This is entirely a manifestation of American imperialism's death throes and self-destruction.
    In the four weeks of the Korean War, the Korean people have not only crushed the Li Seung-man gang's army, but also dealt a head-on blow to the American invading forces, puncturing this paper tiger of American imperialism all over. This glorious victory has greatly encouraged the people of the world to defeat American imperialism's aggression and war, and greatly strengthened the power of the peace and democracy camp. This is the Korean people's great contribution to world peace, so the "Worldwide Active Support for Korean People Week" is being enthusiastically launched among progressive people around the world who love freedom, democracy, and peace, becoming the mainstream of the current international peace movement.
    The people of Southeast Asia, striving for national liberation and people's democracy, are conducting armed struggles in Vietnam, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, and Indonesia. They have long understood the sinful nature of American imperialism, because the chief culprit who has supplied the British, French, and Dutch colonialists and other puppet lackey governments with weapons and "military aid" to massacre the people of Southeast Asia on a large scale in recent years is precisely this hideous American imperialism. They are very clear that American imperialism's interference in Southeast Asian countries did not begin today, but is its consistent policy of expansion. Therefore, Truman's strengthening of "military aid" to Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries cannot scare the people of Southeast Asia, but can only arouse their more resolute resistance.
    President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said: "The united strength of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia will certainly be able to eliminate the French colonialists and American interventionists. American imperialists have already been defeated in China, and they will also be defeated in Vietnam." General Commander Taruc of the Philippine People's Liberation Army also emphasized: "The military and economic aid given by the United States to the reactionary ruling group in the Philippines is not enough to suppress and prevent the development of the growing national struggle." This is how the people of Southeast Asia responded to Truman's statement, firmly believing that they will eventually be able to drive American imperialism out of Southeast Asia!

　　把美国帝国主义赶出东南亚去！
    里昂
    由于中国人民在伟大胜利之后准备渡海解放台湾；由于朝鲜人民共和国的军队打垮了李承晚匪帮的挑衅，胜利地向南进攻；由于东南亚各国人民的武装斗争日益发展和壮大，尤其是在越南和菲律宾的人民武装斗争已震撼了反动傀儡政权的基础；因此美国帝国主义狗急跳墙，显出穷凶极恶的真面目。杜鲁门公开发表了无耻的声明，实行派兵进攻朝鲜人民，武装侵略台湾，并对越南和对菲律宾等国加强内政干涉。这完全是美国帝国主义垂死挣扎，自取灭亡的表现。
    在四个星期的朝鲜战争中间，朝鲜人民不仅打垮了李承晚匪帮的军队，而且给予美国侵略军队迎头痛击，将美帝这只纸老虎戳得遍体鳞伤。这种辉煌的胜利，大大鼓舞了全世界人民击败美国帝国主义进行侵略和战争的信心，大大增强了和平民主阵营的力量。这是朝鲜人民对世界和平的伟大贡献，因此“全世界积极支援朝鲜人民周”在全世界爱好自由民主和平的进步人士中间热烈展开，成为当前国际和平运动的主流。
    争取民族解放和人民民主的东南亚人民，在越南、菲律宾、缅甸、马来亚、印尼各国进行武装斗争。他们早就领略到美国帝国主义的罪恶本色，因为战后几年来拿武器和“军事援助”供给英法荷殖民者及其他傀儡走狗政府，来大量屠杀东南亚人民的祸首，正是这个狞恶的美帝国主义。他们非常清楚：美国帝国主义干涉东南亚各国，并不是从今开始，而是他一贯的扩张政策。因此杜鲁门加强对越南和对菲律宾等国的“军事援助”，吓不倒东南亚人民，只能引起他们更坚决的抵抗罢了。
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席说：“越南，老挝，柬埔寨人民联合起来的力量，一定能够消灭法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者。美帝国主义者已在中国遭到了失败，他们在越南也将被击败”。菲律宾人民解放军总司令塔鲁克也强调说：“美国给菲律宾反动统治集团的军事经济援助，不足以镇压和阻止日益成长的民族斗争的发展”。东南亚人民是这样答复杜鲁门声明的，他们坚信最后一定可以把美帝赶出东南亚去！
