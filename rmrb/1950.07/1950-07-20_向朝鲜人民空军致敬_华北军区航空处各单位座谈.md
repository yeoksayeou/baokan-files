　　Saluting the Korean People's Air Force
    Symposium of Units of the North China Military Region Aviation Department
    [Our Newspaper] The units of the Aviation Department of the North China Military Region held separate symposiums on the afternoon of the 18th. They unanimously believed that the defeat of the U.S. imperialism in Korea fully demonstrated the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of U.S. imperialism; at the same time, it also completely exposed the ferocious face of imperialism to all peace-loving people in the world. Comrades unanimously expressed that they would resolutely unite all peace-loving people to defeat imperialist aggression and the conspiracy of a new world war. Tan Hanzhou said: "We salute the Korean People's Air Force brother units and learn from their heroic and resourceful combat spirit." Feng Qilu said: "The conditions for victory are not entirely determined by weapons, but by the people who use them. The disastrous defeat of the U.S. imperialist air force and army in Korea is enough to prove this truth." In order to celebrate the great victory of the Korean people, the comrades wrote letters to the Korean people one after another. The letters clearly pointed out: "Let those U.S. imperialist executioners who dare to invade the Korean people, under the power of the Korean people, get out of the free Korean territory!"

　　向朝鲜人民空军致敬
    华北军区航空处各单位座谈
    【本报讯】华北军区航空处各单位十八日下午分别举行座谈会，一致认为美帝在朝鲜的失败，充分说明美帝国主义的外强中干；同时也就使帝国主义的凶恶面目完全暴露在全世界爱好和平人民的面前。同志们一致表示，要坚决团结一切爱好和平的人们，击败帝国主义的侵略和新世界战争阴谋。谭汉洲说：“我们向朝鲜人民空军兄弟部队致敬，并学习他们英勇机智的作战精神。”冯启禄说：“胜利的条件并不完全决定于武器，而在于使用武器的人。美帝空军与陆军在朝鲜的惨败是足以证明这个真理的。为了庆祝朝鲜人民的伟大胜利，同志们纷纷写信给朝鲜人民。信中明确地指出：“让那些敢于侵略朝鲜人民的美帝国主义刽子手们，在朝鲜人民的威力下滚出自由朝鲜的国土吧！”
