　　Chongqing Xinhua Daily News: The Economic Protection Division of the Southwest Public Security Department, relying on the masses, has carried out economic protection work in more than 100 enterprises and institutions affiliated to industrial, mining, transportation, and financial departments, protecting state property and the lives and safety of the working class. In the past five months, in addition to suppressing bandits and hidden enemy agents by armed force, it has also sent cadres to various enterprise departments to investigate and understand the situation, cooperated with the work of various departments to carry out policy propaganda and anti-espionage education, and established some mass-based security organizations. It also relied on the masses to arrest Xue Kegang, deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Pseudo-Military Industry Department's Police Department, and others who attempted to conceal themselves and carry out sabotage.

　　Due to the increased awareness of the working class, workers in factories throughout the Southwest have universally established worker pickets and factory protection groups, protecting the safety of the factories and assisting the government in reporting enemy agents. For example, most of the enemy agents arrested in various factories on January 18 were reported by workers. Zhu Chongli, a Kuomintang agent who had been lurking in Factory 50, had harmed workers before liberation. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits sabotaged the factory, Zhu was the principal offender. After liberation, he disguised himself and went into hiding. When worker Gao Dianchen encountered him, he immediately reported him to the Public Security Bureau, and he was arrested. More than 2,000 employees and students of the Kunming Railway Bureau organized a volunteer team, which played a significant role in protecting the railway. Since January, enemy agents and bandits have systematically sabotaged railways, power lines, rails, ties, and spikes, all of which have been uncovered by the volunteer team, and more than 20 bandits and enemy agents have been arrested. On February 26, the volunteer team arrested a special agent at the railway station who was carrying ten packages of yellow explosives, ten detonators, and fuses, attempting to blow up the largest bridge on the railway. In the shipping department, worker pickets have been organized on every ship since February to maintain order on board. Recently, the Seamen's Union has also drafted a safety convention for ships, and is carrying out education among all seamen to protect the safety of ships. The Dongchuan Post Office and the Civil Aviation Administration have also established or are in the process of establishing security organizations. In order to strengthen transportation security, transportation departments in various parts of the Southwest are currently establishing security agencies and allocating cadres.

　　The public security forces of the Economic Protection Division of the Southwest Public Security Department, in close coordination with local armed forces, the People's Liberation Army, and the working masses, have repelled ten attacks and disturbances by bandits from February to June, protecting the safety of large factories and mines such as the Nantong Coal Mine and the Qijiang Iron Mine. For example, on February 13, more than 1,500 armed enemy agents and bandits, including those of the "Loyal Righteousness to Save the Nation Army," surrounded the Nantong Coal Mine, attempting to sabotage the first mine shaft and machinery and equipment of the Nantong Coal Mine. The garrison force in the mine, consisting of only 26 men, immediately led by Platoon Leader Zhuang Jishun, cooperated with more than ten security guards to conduct a tenacious resistance. After fighting for ten hours, the bandits were completely repelled, killing 16 and wounding more than 100. Two of our fighters sacrificed their lives, protecting the safety of the mine. Because the public security forces actively protect the factories and mines and protect the safety of the workers, the workers often automatically provide the troops with information, and some even assist the troops in suppressing bandits.

　　In more than 70 other units, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Trade, banks, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, security sections and security divisions have begun to be established. Banks and warehouses have established management and other systems, improved safety equipment, and strengthened armed protection.

　　At present, enemy agents and bandits have adopted the method of lurking and hiding inside various industries, waiting for an opportunity to act. Therefore, all departments, factories, and mines must be more vigilant, strengthen mass-based security work, and smash the conspiracies of enemy agents and bandits.

　　西南公安部经济保卫处
    依靠群众深入开展经济保卫工作
    特务破坏分子转入隐蔽活动应予密切注意
    【重庆讯】重庆新华日报消息：西南公安部经济保卫处依靠群众在工矿、交通、财经等部门所属一百多个企业单位中，开展经济保卫工作，保护了国家财产和工人阶级的生命安全。五个月来，除以武装镇压土匪和暗藏特务外，并派干部到各企业部门调查了解情况，配合各部门工作进行政策宣传及肃清特务教育，建立了部分群众性的保卫组织。并依靠群众逮捕了企图隐蔽破坏的重庆市伪兵工署警务处副处长薛克刚等。
    由于工人阶级觉悟提高，西南各工厂职工都普遍建立了工人纠察队、护厂组，保护了工厂的安全，并协助政府检举特务。如一月十八日在各工厂逮捕的特务中，绝大部分是工人检举的。曾潜伏五十厂的军统特务朱崇礼，解放前残害工人，当蒋匪破坏该厂时，朱是主犯，解放后，即化装潜伏。工人高殿臣遇见后，当即报告公安局捕获。昆明铁路局两千余职工及学生组织的义勇队，在保护铁路中起了很大的作用。一月份以来，特务、土匪有计划地破坏铁路、电线、铁轨、道木、道钉，均已被义勇队破获，逮捕土匪、特务二十余人。二月二十六日义勇队在车站逮捕了一个带十包黄色炸药、十支雷管及导火线，企图炸坏铁路上最大桥梁的特务。航务部门，从二月份开始每一只轮船，都组织了工人纠察队，维持船上的秩序。最近海员工会更拟定了船上安全公约草案，在全体海员中展开保护轮船安全的教育。东川邮局和民用航空局也已建立或正在建立保卫组织。为了加强交通保卫工作，目前西南各地交通部门正在建立保卫机构，并配备干部。
    西南公安部经济保卫处的公安部队与地方武装及人民解放军、工人群众密切配合，从二月到六月曾击溃土匪十次袭击扰乱，保护了南桐煤矿、綦江铁矿等大厂矿的安全。如二月十三日有“忠义救军国”等武装特务、土匪一千五百余名，将南桐煤矿包围，企图破坏南桐煤矿第一厂矿井及机器设备，驻矿部队仅二十六人，当即由排长庄纪顺率领，与警卫部队十余人配合，进行顽强抵抗。战斗达十时之久，将匪完全击退，毙匪十六名，伤一百余名，我方战士牺牲两名，保护了矿厂的安全。由于公安部队积极护厂、护矿，保护工人群众的安全，因之工人常自动供给部队情况，有的并协助部队剿匪。
    其他财政部、贸易部、银行、农林水利部等七十多个单位中，已开始建立保卫科和保卫处；银行、仓库则建立管理等制度，改善安全设备，加强武装保护。
    现特务匪徒已采取潜伏隐蔽在各业内部待机而动的办法，因而各部门、各厂矿更须提高警惕，加强群众性的保卫工作，粉碎特务匪徒的阴谋。
