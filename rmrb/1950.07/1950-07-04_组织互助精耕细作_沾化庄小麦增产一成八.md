　　Organized Mutual Aid, Intensive Cultivation
    Zhuang Village, Zhanhua, Increases Wheat Production by 18%
    [Report from our correspondent in Feixian] Zhuang Village, in the second district of Feixian, Shandong Province, has increased its wheat production by 18% compared to last year. This year, the village planted 265 mu of wheat and harvested a total of 53,000 jin, averaging 200 jin per mu. Last year, the village planted 270 mu and harvested a total of 45,900 jin, averaging 170 jin per mu. Compared with last year, the village's total production increased by 7,100 jin, an average increase of 30 jin per mu (18%). Among these, the mutual aid groups of Miao Yuchun, Zheng Qingyou, and Li Zhilan had the highest increase in production, averaging 240 jin of wheat per mu, an increase of 70 jin per mu compared to last year's average. The Xu Youxin group had the lowest yield, averaging 125 jin of wheat per mu, but this was still an increase of 25 jin per mu compared to their own wheat harvest last year.

    The reason for the increase in wheat production in this village is mainly due to the fact that the CCP branch led the villagers to organize, ensuring timely planting, intensive cultivation, increased fertilizer application, and largely planting improved varieties. For example, all 20 Party members in the village participated in leading production in mutual aid groups, promoting more than 90 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers and 28 young and middle-aged women in the village to participate in mutual aid groups, ensuring that most of the wheat fields were sown in time last year. In terms of intensive cultivation, 200 mu out of the village's 265 mu of wheat fields were plowed twice, and at the same time, they were deeply ploughed by one finger (depth), and harrowed three times, which played a great role in increasing production (according to years of experience, with the same land, same fertilizer, and same effort, double plowing yields 40 jin more grain than single plowing); in terms of fertilization, it also far exceeded last year, with an average of 35 loads of manure applied per mu, 10 loads more than last year's 25 loads per mu, with some groups applying as many as 60 loads per mu. Planting of improved wheat varieties was also more common, with 80% of the village implementing seed selection, and 210 mu out of 250 mu of wheat being "foreign white wheat" (high yield, no bearded wheat or black wheat, each ear has 80 grains this year). The village also attached great importance to weeding wheat, generally doing one round of weeding, with 74% of them doing two rounds. In addition, the work of planting on behalf of martyrs, military personnel, and industrial workers was well done, and most of the masses planted on behalf of others as diligently as they planted their own land. This is also one of the reasons for the general increase in wheat production this year.

　　组织互助精耕细作
    沾化庄小麦增产一成八
    【本报费县讯】山东费县二区沾化庄小麦比去年增产一成八。该村今年种麦二百六十五亩，共收麦五万三千斤，每亩平均收二百斤。去年种二百七十亩，共收麦四万五千九百斤，每亩平均收一百七十斤。今年与去年比较，全村共计增产七千一百斤，每亩平均增产三十斤（合一成八）。其中以苗玉春、郑清有、李志兰三个变工组增产为最多，每亩平均收麦二百四十斤，比去年平均数每亩增产七十斤。以许有信一组产量为最差，每亩平均收麦一百二十五斤，但也比去年本组麦收每亩增产二十五斤。
    该村麦子所以能够增产，主要是由于中共支部领导全村农民组织起来，做到了耕种及时，精耕细作，多上粪，大部种植优良品种的结果。如该村二十个党员即全部参加了变工组领导生产，推动全村九十余个整半劳力、二十八个青壮年妇女参加了变工组，保证了去年绝大部分麦田的下种及时。在精耕细作方面，全村二百六十五亩麦田中，有二百亩剿了二犁（即耕了两遍），同时还深耕了一指、耙了三遍，这对增产起了很大作用（根据几年来的经验，同样土地、同样粪水和工夫，剿二犁的比不剿二犁的多打四十斤粮）；在施肥方面，也远远超过了去年，平均每亩施粪三十五挑，比去年每亩施粪二十五挑多了十挑，有的组每亩施到六十挑之多。种植优良麦种亦较为普遍，全村有百分之八十实行了选种，二百五十亩麦子中有二百一十亩是“洋白麦”（产量大，没有胡麦和乌麦，今年每一穗有八十个粒子）。该村对锄麦工作亦很重视，一般做到普锄一遍，其中有百分之七十四锄了两遍。此外，对烈、军、工属的代种工作做得好，绝大部分群众代种别人的地都和种自己的地一样。这也是今年麦子普遍增产的原因之一。
