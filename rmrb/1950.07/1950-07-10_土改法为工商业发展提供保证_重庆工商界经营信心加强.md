　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th. Industrial and commercial figures in Chongqing unanimously expressed their support for the Land Reform Law. They generally believe that the Land Reform Law is an extremely complete major law for abolishing the feudal land system. In particular, the provision regarding "protecting industry and commerce from infringement" has given them immense encouragement. Hu Zi'ang, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, believes that the Land Reform Law provides the greatest guarantee for the development of industry and commerce. Fan Hengcai, Manager of the Operations Department of Tianfu Coal Mine Company, pointed out that before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, many landlords who also engaged in industry and commerce were worried that their industrial and commercial businesses would also be confiscated and distributed. He said, "Now the Land Reform Law clearly stipulates: protect industry and commerce and do not infringe upon them. Landlords who were previously afraid of having their industrial and commercial businesses confiscated can now concentrate on managing their own industrial and commercial businesses." Tong Shaosheng, Acting General Manager of Minsheng Company, which operates shipping, believes that the prospects for the shipping industry are also very promising after the improvement of farmers' living standards. In addition, people in department stores and other industries also stated that the promulgation of the Land Reform Law has further strengthened their confidence in managing their own businesses.

　　土改法为工商业发展提供保证
    重庆工商界经营信心加强
    【新华社重庆八日电】重庆市工商界人士一致表示拥护土地改革法。工商界人士普遍认为：土地改革法是一部极其完整的废除封建土地制度的大法。特别是关于“保护工商业不得侵犯”的规定，更给了他们一种莫大的鼓舞。工商界联合会主任委员胡子昂认为：土地改革法给工商业的发展，提供了最大的保证。天府煤矿公司营运处经理樊恒才提出：土地改革法颁布前，不少兼营工商业的地主，疑惧他经营的工商业也会被没收分配，他说：“现在土地改革法上明文规定：保护工商业，不得侵犯。过去怕没收工商业的地主，现在可以专心经营自己的工商业了。”经营航运的民生公司代总经理童少生认为：农民生活水准提高后，航运业的前途也是很远大的。此外，百货等业的人士亦表示：因为土地改革法的公布，更加强了经营本身事业的信心。
