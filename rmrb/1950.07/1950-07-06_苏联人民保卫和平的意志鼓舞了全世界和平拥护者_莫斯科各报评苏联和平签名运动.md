　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch from TASS: Moscow newspapers published editorials on the 1st, commenting on the vigorous campaign underway in the Soviet Union to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace.

　　The *Pravda* editorial, entitled "The Indestructible Will of the Soviet People," stated: "The peace signature campaign, from its very beginning, has aroused a powerful wave of political enthusiasm in the Soviet Union, demonstrating the love and support of the entire Soviet people for Stalin's peaceful foreign policy. The Soviet peace signature campaign is of enormous international significance. The common will of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union to fight for peace inspires peace advocates in all countries, strengthens their confidence in their own strength, and awakens millions of kind people to more actively defend peace and oppose warmongers. The powerful voice of the Soviet people resounds throughout the world; it is the voice of the people who once defeated the German and Japanese fascists. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are listening to this voice with deep hope, because they deeply know: wherever the Soviet people are, wherever the great Stalin is, there is always victory."

　　The *Izvestia* editorial, entitled "A Stern Warning to the Warmongers," stated: "The powerful Soviet Union, with its consistent peace policy and its determination to resolutely thwart the plans of the warmongers, stands before the world as a beacon of peace and democracy, a great hope for the people of the world. The Stockholm Appeal has already been signed by more than 100 million people worldwide, and the great Soviet people will also sign this petition. The powerful will of the people who are the victors, the people who are the creators, will be manifested in a unified action to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal."
