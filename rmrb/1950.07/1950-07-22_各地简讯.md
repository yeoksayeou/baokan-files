    Cattle Plague Discovered in Cao County, Heze
    In late June and early July, cattle plague was discovered in individual villages in Cao County and Heze, Pingyuan Province. Sick cattle have increased body temperatures, do not eat grass, and some have swollen abdomens and excrete black feces. Most die in four days, while some die in four or five hours. At the time of death, the mouth bleeds and the skin has black spots; dissection shows that the internal organs are mostly rotten. In addition to sending people to prevent and treat the plague, the Heze Prefectural Commissioner's Office has notified all areas to take strict precautions.
