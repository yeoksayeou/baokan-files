　　After Seeing "Zhao Yiman"
　　Zhong Dianfei

　　There is a group of warmongering aggressors in the world who think this way: once they rely on superior military force, there will be no justice or truth in the world; people's appearances and mental states will be changed according to their ideas. But facts have proved that their ideas are wrong, and "Zhao Yiman" is a good example. Japanese imperialism ruled Northeast China with its powerful military for fourteen years, but people like Zhao Yiman, who were坚贞不屈(resolute and unyielding), emerged among the people of Northeast China—and not just one.
　　Zhao Yiman's husband was an old revolutionary who participated in the "February 7th" strike. After the "September 18th" Incident, he led a workers' anti-Japanese strike in Harbin and was arrested. Zhao Yiman—this worker's wife, because she witnessed and personally experienced the pain suffered by her class brothers under enemy rule, because she believed in the future of the working class, believed in the Party, and believed in the people, this gave her endless strength. After the urban struggle suffered difficulties, she was ordered by the Party to lead some workers to the countryside to lead the peasants' anti-Japanese struggle. In the countryside, she began to lead the women's work of the Anti-Japanese United Association. Later, she served as a political commissar in Zhao Shangzhi's regiment, directly leading armed struggles.
　　In one battle, the team commanded by Zhao Yiman was subjected to a powerful enemy attack. In order to ensure the safe transfer of the main force, she took a platoon of people to remain in the original position to block the enemy. She was wounded in the fighting. She was captured by the enemy in a coma. The enemy attempted to obtain information about the activities of Zhao Shangzhi's troops from her. After inflicting cruel torture, they sent her to a hospital, attempting to torture her for a long time. It was in this hospital that she conducted patriotic propaganda to those who approached her, causing a female nurse, Xiao Han, and a Dong guard sent by the enemy to accept the truth of the revolution. A few days before the enemy decided to execute her, she escaped with their help of Dong guard and Xiao Han. The enemy discovered this and immediately sent troops to chase them back. So Zhao Yiman was imprisoned. On June 30th—the day before the Party's birthday, a group of executioners entered her prison and called her name. So she dressed, got up and walked out with her head held high. The enemy wanted to tie her up, but she sternly rebuked them. Among her fellow prisoners, she gave a brief but powerful speech. Under the sky floating with light clouds, she strode forward… Just as she said, the enemy wanted to get information about the activities of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army from her mouth, but the enemy got nothing. The enemy destroyed her body, but truth and justice exist alongside the sun and moon!
　　The theme of this film is positive and healthy. It not only expresses the noble national integrity and class integrity of a figure like Zhao Yiman. Moreover, it illustrates the role of the working class in leading the peasant struggle. From beginning to end, Zhao Yiman always educated the peasant masses with her advanced class's exemplary behavior. Without the work of thousands upon thousands of figures like Zhao Yiman, it would be impossible for the Party to lead the peasants forward; it would be unimaginable for the Chinese people to achieve today's victory. At the same time, it also shows that when a powerful national enemy invades our country, the mass base of the revolutionary struggle is very broad. The doctor treated Zhao Yiman in order to "fulfill his due responsibilities." But when the enemy tortured this hero again, even this person who originally only thought about "fulfilling his due responsibilities" was excited! Xiao Han and Dong guard, they naturally did not understand communism, but due to a sense of national justice, they sympathized with a communist, sympathized with Zhao Yiman, who was called a "bandit leader" by the enemy.
　　In our artistic works, various revolutionary struggles have been reflected, but to express various struggles as interconnected, rather than mutually divided, requires a high degree of political thought to grasp. Zhao Yiman was originally a female worker in a yarn factory, but after she transferred to the countryside, she first established good contact with the peasants; when she was arrested and lived in the hospital, she established contact with the nurses and those guarding her. Moreover, when she discovered enemy pursuers after escaping and the situation was critical, she resolutely saved the lives of Xiao Han and Lao Dong, determined to sacrifice herself. Communists are truly the least selfish people. This noble class quality is well embodied in Zhao Yiman.
　　Expressing that the will of a nation is unyielding, and that after suffering thousands of hardships, it finally stood up. This is a very important thing in the theme of our artistic depiction. Zhao Yiman's character is not only a portrait of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, a concentrated reflection of a typical character, but also educates every Chinese people in return. Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, no matter how temporarily imposing and powerful they are, what can they do to our great Chinese nation! The educational significance of "Zhao Yiman" is that it will help the continued growth of this great and strong character of the Chinese people.
　　However, this film, which takes its material from real struggles, also reveals some of its shortcomings in expressing the strategy of the struggle. The film begins by depicting the urban workers' movement led by Zhao Yiman and her husband. Because it failed to properly educate the working class in advance to understand the basic situation of the enemy's strength and our weakness, the struggle was easily launched. After the struggle began, some inappropriate methods of struggle were adopted. The enemy, who was in the limelight, was excessively stimulated. Although the workers superficially received the benefits of increased wages, the revolutionary forces were exposed too early, causing the backbone of the struggle to suffer persecution by the enemy. Therefore, the Party had to order them to retreat from the city. In the countryside, the armed forces led by Zhao Yiman attacked the enemy's blockhouses, destroyed the enemy's transportation… In order to give the enemy a necessary blow and strengthen their own armed forces, it was naturally right to do so. However, at that time, the Japanese invaders had already adopted extremely cruel methods of rule in Northeast China, doing their best to cut off the connection between the Anti-Japanese Allied Army and the masses. Under such harsh conditions, Zhao Yiman and her comrades should have better, politically and militarily, according to the specific circumstances, used the most appropriate methods to persist in the struggle and create new favorable conditions, which they did not seem to consider enough. The film shows them finally trapped on a mountain, without food, only able to eat mushrooms and wild vegetables, which is naturally a serious situation! It shows that their struggle was forced to shrink. At that time, the political leadership of the regiment had to take the initiative to quickly change this situation and must find ways to establish contact with the masses; if they continued according to the situation at that time, even if the enemy did not attack them with powerful forces, it would be difficult for them to support themselves for long. Because they did not seriously consider this point, until the end, the special agents actually penetrated to the edge of the venue where they were holding a celebration meeting; the enemy dispatched a large number of troops straight towards them, and they were completely unaware of it beforehand! In this way, the strategic line of the struggle led by Zhao Yiman at that time was indeed flawed. This shortcoming may have existed in the actual struggle at that time, but this point is worth arousing our vigilance!
　　In film production, the author wants to use the character of Zhao Yiman to reflect the struggle life of the people of Northeast China in fourteen years, such as supporting the army, joining the army, etc. The author has almost meticulously expressed these. Even scenes of Zhao Yiman leading the team to climb mountains, wade through water, and cross railways, this kind of routine life of the guerrillas, are all without omission; however, in handling the important plot of Zhao Yiman's escape from the hospital, it is not clearly explained. The guard tells the enemy that they have decided to execute her in early July, only a few days away. The guard and the young nurse appear very flustered, and Zhao Yiman also shows indecision at this time. She only says to leave, but how to leave? Since there are already two close people helping, and they have expressed their determination. However, they have no experience in struggle. As a political commissar of a regiment, Zhao Yiman must first use a high degree of composure to finally review their revolutionary determination and prevent their blind action at this time. After affirming that they (especially the guard sent by the enemy) are indeed reliable, she should help them plan meticulously. Estimate the possible situations after leaving and come up with countermeasures. Because Zhao did not do this, she hurriedly followed them. The car would carry them to escape into the mountains, leaving obvious traces. Zhao did not try to confuse the enemy, nor did she think of countermeasures after the enemy discovered and rushed over, so she finally fell into the hands of the enemy!
　　So when the film shows them sitting in a large cart, leisurely looking at the opposite mountain; the camera turns to the treetops, expressing their happy mood at that time, the audience actually breaks out in a cold sweat for them! They were unfortunately caught in the end. And Zhao quickly sacrificed. This point makes the film's persuasive power of Zhao's final sacrifice somewhat reduced.
　　Some people feel that "Zhao Yiman" is too much like "Daughter of China," not only are the plots of the stories somewhat similar, but in some shots they look alike. This is naturally because the themes of the two films are taken from the stories of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and the methods and styles of struggle are generally similar. However, to be regarded as two independent and complete works of art, this kind of similarity must be avoided as much as possible. What I find particularly insufficient is that the endings of the struggles depicted in these two films are both failures. Although their heroic deeds also give people a valuable inspiration and strength, I believe that there are many examples in reality that can both express heroism and make the struggle victorious, and attention should be paid to this aspect of selection. Otherwise, we will not be able to better explain the quantitative changes in the development process from which the great achievements of the Chinese people today have been achieved.
　　In terms of actors, I think that Comrade Shi Lianxing, who plays Zhao Yiman, embodies the image of a real revolutionary hero on the screen, which is commendable. Zhao Yiman is沉毅(calm and resolute), firm, and does not feel particularly prominent, which is the original color of general revolutionary heroes, and it is also a difficult trick to master in performing this kind of new character. In ordinary general life, she is approachable; when the revolution needs her to come up with ideas and sacrifice herself, she shows firmness and courage that are not easily achieved by ordinary people. Because of her accessibility, she is great; because of her firmness and courage, she becomes a hero. The role played by Comrade Shi Lianxing can be said to be generally in line with the hero who has already shed the last drop of his blood for the Party and the people. Other such as Zhang LaoTou, Lu DaNiang, Lu DaYe, who deliver letters for Zhao Yiman, are also very excellent images of Chinese peasants; Comrade An Qi, who plays Xiao Han, and Comrade Luo Tai, who plays the enemy's judicial section chief, have completed their roles on the screen.
　　In the past year, our new film art has been rapidly enriched and improved in terms of artistic thought and technology. Everyone feels excited about this progress.

### 看了“赵一曼”以后

　　看了“赵一曼”以后
　　钟惦棐
    世界上有一批黩武侵略者们这样想：一朝凭借了优势的武力，人间便将不复有正义和真理存在；人的样子和精神状态，将会按照他们的念头加以改变。而事实证明，他们的想法是错了的，“赵一曼”便是个很好的例子。日本帝国主义以强大的武力，统治了东北十四年，东北人民中却出现了像赵一曼这样坚贞不屈的人物——而且不只一个。
    赵一曼的丈夫，是一个参加过“二七”大罢工的老革命者。“九一八”以后，他在哈尔滨领导工人反日罢工，被捕了。赵一曼——这工人的妻子，由于她目睹和身受过阶级的兄弟在敌人统治下所受的痛楚，由于她相信工人阶级的未来，相信党，相信人民，这便使得她获得了无穷无尽的力量。城市的斗争遭受困难后，她奉到党的命令，领导部分工人转入农村，领导农民抗日斗争。她在农村中，开始领导抗日联合会的妇女工作。后来，在赵尚志的一个团里当政治委员，直接领导武装斗争。
    在一次战斗中，赵一曼所指挥的队伍遭到了敌人的强大袭击。为了保证主力得以安全转移，她带了一排人留在原阵地阻击敌人。在作战中，她受了伤。在昏迷中被敌人俘虏了。敌人企图从她口中得到赵尚志队伍的活动消息，在施以毒刑之后，送她到一个医院里，企图长久地折磨她。就在这个医院里，她对接近她的人进行了爱国主义的宣传，使一个女看护员小韩和一个从敌人那里派来的董看守接受了革命的真理。在敌人已决定处决她的前几天，由于得到董看守和小韩的营救，她们共同逃走了。敌人发觉后，立刻派部队把他们追了回来。于是赵一曼被关进了监狱里。六月三十日——在党的生日的前一天，一群刽子手走进她的监狱，点了她的名字。她于是穿好衣服，昂然走了出来。敌人要捆绑她，被她厉色斥退了。在难友们间，她作了简短而有力的演说。在飘浮着淡淡的云彩的天空下，她昂首前进……正如她说的，敌人想从她口中得到关于抗日联军活动的消息，但敌人却什么也没有得到。敌人毁灭了她的躯体，然而真理和正义却与日月并存！
    这部片子的主题思想是积极的、健康的。它不仅表现了像赵一曼这样一种人物崇高的民族气节，阶级气节。而且，它说明了工人阶级在领导农民斗争中的作用。从头到尾，赵一曼总是以自己先进阶级的模范行为教育着农民群众。没有成千上万的像赵一曼这样人物的工作，党要领导农民前进是不可能的；中国人民要获得今天这样的胜利，是不可想像的。同时，它也说明了当一个强大的民族敌人打进我们国土来的时候，革命斗争的群众基础是很广泛的。医生为赵一曼看病，原是为了“尽他应尽的责任”。但当敌人再次折磨这个英雄的时候，便连这个原只想到“尽他应尽的责任”的人，也激动起来了！小韩和董看守，他们自然并不懂得共产主义，但是由于一种民族的正义感，使他们同情了一个共产党人，同情了一个被敌人称做“匪首”的赵一曼。
    在我们的艺术作品中，曾经反映了各式各样的革命斗争，但要把各种斗争表现成为互相联系，而不是互相分割，这便需要高度的政策思想才能把握得住。赵一曼原是一个纱厂女工，但她在转入农村以后，首先和农民取得了很好的联系；在被捕住在医院里的时候，又和看护以及看守她的人取得了联系。而且当她逃走后发现敌人追兵，情况正危急的时候，又毅然地挽救了小韩和老董的生命，决心牺牲自己。共产主义者真是最不自私的人。这种崇高的阶级品质，在赵一曼身上得到了很好的体现。
    表现一个民族的意志不可屈服，在经过千般磨难之后，它终于站了起来。这是我们艺术描写主题上一件很重要的事情。赵一曼的性格不仅是中华民族优秀儿女的写照，是一种典型性格的集中反映，同时它又反转来教育着每一个中国人民。日本帝国主义也好，美国帝国主义也好，那怕他们有雷电般暂时的声势和威力，然而，其奈我伟大的中华民族何！“赵一曼”的教育意义，便是它将帮助中国人民这种伟大坚强的性格继续成长。
    但是这个从真实斗争摄取题材的影片，在表现斗争的策略上，也还表现着它的某些缺陷。电影在开始描写赵一曼和她的丈夫所领导的城市工人运动，由于事先未能很好教育工人阶级了解当前敌强我弱的基本情况，轻易地使斗争展开了。而在斗争开始后，又采取了某些不适合的斗争方式。使正在风头上的敌人，受到过分的刺激。虽然在表面上工人得到了增资的实惠，但革命的力量却过早地暴露了，使斗争中的骨干遭受了敌人的迫害。所以党不能不命令他们从城市中退却。在农村中，赵一曼所领导的武装，袭击敌人的碉堡，破坏敌人的交通……为了给敌人以必要的打击，壮大自己的武装，这样作自然是对的。但是，当时日寇在东北已经采取了极残酷的统治方法，极力切断抗联部队和群众的联系。在这样恶劣的条件之下，赵一曼和她的战友们在政治上、军事上应该怎样更好地根据具体情况，运用最适当的方式，来坚持斗争，并造成新的有利的条件，这在他们似乎还考虑得不够。电影表现他们最后困守在一个山头上，没有吃的，只能吃蘑菇和野菜，这情形自然就严重了！说明他们的斗争是被迫缩小了。当时团的政治领导，必须主动迅速地改变这种情况，一定要设法和群众取得联系；如果就照当时的情形下去，敌人即使不以强大的兵力向他们进攻，他们亦很难长久支持。由于他们没有严重地考虑到这点，直到最后特务竟然深入到他们开庆祝会的会场边上；敌人出动了大量的军队直奔他们而来，而他们在事前竟毫无所知！这样看来，赵一曼当时所领导的这一斗争在策略路线上实是有缺点的了。这种缺点或者存在于当时的实际斗争中，但这一点，是值得引起我们警惕的！
    在电影制作上，作者要借赵一曼这个人物来反映东北人民在十四年中的斗争生活，如拥军、参军等，作者差不多都很细致地表现着这些。甚至像赵一曼领着队伍爬山、涉水、过铁路等，这种游击队平常生活的镜头，也都一无遗漏；而在处理赵一曼从医院逃走这个重要的情节上，却没有交待清楚。看守告诉敌人已决定在七月初要处决她，离当时只有几天。看守和那个年轻的女看护表现得很慌张，赵一曼此时也表现了拿不定主意。只是说要走，但如何走呢？既然已经有了两个贴身人的帮助，他们并表示了决心。但是，他们对于斗争却毫无经验。作为一个团政治委员的赵一曼，在此时首先必须以高度的镇静来最后审查他们的革命决心和防止他们的盲动。应该在肯定他们（尤其是那个从敌人方面派来的看守）确实可靠之后，帮助他们周密计划。估计在走后可能发生的情况，并想出对策。因为赵没有作到这一点，便匆匆忙忙地跟他们走了。汽车要载着他们逃到山里去，留下的痕迹是明显的。赵没有设法迷惑敌人，又没有想到敌人发现赶到后的对策，所以最后还是落入敌人手中！
    所以当电影表现他们坐上大车，悠悠然地望着对面的山头；镜头又转向树梢，表现他们当时那种快活心境的时候，观众实为他们捏了一把冷汗！他们不幸终被捉住。而且赵很快地便牺牲了。这一点，使电影对于赵在最后的牺牲，便多少减低了它的说服力量。
    有人觉得《赵一曼》太像《中华女儿》，不但故事的情节有些类似，而在某些镜头上看起来也相仿佛。这自然由于两部电影的题材都采自东北抗日联军的故事，在斗争的方式和样式上，大体是相似的。但要作为两部独立、完整的艺术作品看，这种雷同，便又是要尽力避免的了。尤其使我感到不足的是：这两部影片所描写的斗争，结局都是失败的。虽然她们的英雄事迹，也使人获得一种可贵的启示和力量，但我以为存在于现实中那种既能表现英勇而又使斗争获得胜利的事例是很多的，应该注意到这一方面的取材。不然，我们将不能更好说明中国人民今天所获致的伟大成绩在它所由来的那个发展过程中的量的变化。
    在演员方面，我觉得饰赵一曼的石联星同志在银幕上体现了一个真实的革命英雄的形象，这是可贵的。赵一曼沉毅、坚定而又不觉得特别突出，这原是一般革命英雄的本色，同时也是在表演这种新人物上一个难以掌握的诀窍所在。在平常的一般生活中，她平易近人；而在革命需要她出主意、牺牲自己的时候，她又表现了为普通人所不易达到的坚定和勇敢。惟其平易，所以伟大；惟其坚定勇敢，所以成为英雄。石联星同志所饰的这个角色，应该说是大体上符合于那已经为党、为人民流尽了自己最后一滴血的英雄的。其它如为赵一曼送信的张老头、吕大娘、吕大爷，亦是很出色的中国农民的形象；饰小韩的安琪同志和饰敌司法科长的罗泰同志，均在银幕上完成了自己的角色。
    一年来，我们新的电影艺术，在艺术的思想和技术上都在飞快地被丰富和提高着。大家为着这种进步觉得兴奋。    七月五日
