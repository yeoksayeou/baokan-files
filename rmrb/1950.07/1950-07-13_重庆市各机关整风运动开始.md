    Chongqing City's Rectification Movement of Government Organs Begins
    [Reported by this newspaper] Chongqing City's rectification movement of government organs initially unfolded on June 24th. Under the organization and leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the rectification movement, centering on the inspection of work and the inspection of work style, resolutely eliminates bureaucratism, commandism, and all decadent hedonistic thoughts. All cadres at the section chief level and above in the city are being concentrated in the Municipal Committee in two batches for rectification study. The study is divided into: 1. In-depth reading of documents for self-reflection and self-examination. 2. Inspecting work, inspecting work style, and conducting criticism and self-criticism. 3. Synthesizing individual self-reflection and self-examination with everyone's criticism and examination to arrive at a general assessment. During the first batch of concentrated rectification, cadres who are not concentrated will also study the rectification documents. After the first batch of concentrated cadres completes their study, they will return to their organs to lead the general cadres in rectification. In order to ensure the smooth unfolding of the rectification movement, the Municipal Committee convened the Chongqing City Cadre Rectification Mobilization Conference on June 25th, calling on everyone to work hard to transform and improve themselves in the rectification study.
