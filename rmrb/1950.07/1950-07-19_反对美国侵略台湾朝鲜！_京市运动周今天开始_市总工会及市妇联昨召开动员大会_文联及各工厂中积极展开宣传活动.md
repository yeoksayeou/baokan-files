　　Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea!
    Beijing's Campaign Week Begins Today
    Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Women's Federation Held Mobilization Meetings Yesterday; Literary Federation and Factories Actively Conducting Propaganda
    [Our newspaper's combined dispatches] Beijing's People's Campaign Week to Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea is scheduled to begin today. In recent days, organizations such as the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Women's Federation have held mobilization meetings, and workers in various factories have held discussion meetings, actively preparing to carry out various propaganda activities for the Campaign Week. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened cadres from various public factories, private industry trade unions, and district offices of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions yesterday afternoon (the 18th) to hold a mobilization meeting to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and to deploy specific work during the campaign.

    Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Beijing People's Committee to Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting. He said: The shameful acts of American imperialism in directly attacking the Korean people, invading our territory of Taiwan, and interfering in the liberation struggles of the Vietnamese and Filipino people have aroused unanimous anger and widespread opposition from people all over the world. Under the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the working class and the broad masses of people in various countries have universally launched a movement to oppose American aggression. The working class should play an active role in this movement. The experience of the Chinese people defeating American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the recent facts of the Korean people striking at American imperialist armed aggression, fully prove that American imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong on the outside but is weak on the inside, and can be pierced with a single poke by the revolutionary power of the broad masses of the people. He then said: In order to enable the broad masses of people to fully understand the various crimes of aggression committed by American imperialism and its fragility, and to enhance the people's strength and confidence in defeating American imperialism, it is necessary to carry out extensive, repeated, and in-depth propaganda work.

    Finally, he instructed: This movement should be carried out in conjunction with the signature campaign to defend world peace. The work items in this movement can be carried out by each unit, under the condition of not hindering production work, using all possible conditions for propaganda; mobilizing manpower in all aspects, and using various forms such as newspapers, magazines, wall newspapers, paintings, dramas, movies, songs, exhibitions, and speeches to do powerful propaganda; various factories, mines, schools, organs, troops, and suburban areas can hold various meetings separately; and mobilize young people to carry out street propaganda and rural propaganda.

    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to launch a movement to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea among the broad masses of women, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation convened a mobilization meeting of women's work cadres and heads of various women's organizations in each district at 2:30 pm on the 18th to discuss specific steps to launch the movement. Women's work cadres in each district are preparing to cooperate with the cultural and educational departments in their respective districts to carry out propaganda in adult night schools, and to carry out propaganda to scattered housewives through women's representative meetings and existing production or learning organizations. Some women's organizations have already conducted studies and discussions, and are preparing to continue to use methods such as lectures, seminars, and group studies to carry out propaganda within their organizations and among surrounding neighbors and friends.

    Under the leadership of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, literary and art groups and social education institutions in Beijing are actively preparing to launch a widespread propaganda campaign against American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The Theater Industry Association has decided to post slogans and slogans against American aggression at the entrance and inside the theater; the Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Quyi, and "Drama Class Graduates Association" have organized propaganda teams to use the rest time of each theater performance to publicize the significance of the movement against American aggression to the audience. The Quyi circle will also perform drum songs and lyrics opposing American aggression. Movie theaters will show slides and subtitles for propaganda. Various cultural centers and newspaper reading rooms have determined that this propaganda work is the central work recently, and will publish wall newspapers, blackboards, briefings, post maps of the Korean War situation, draw portraits of General Kim Il-sung, and hold public lectures and seminars; and use methods such as broadcasting, cartoons, comic strips, poetry recitations, living newspapers, Quyi, new foreign films, and picture exhibitions to carry out propaganda. The China Youth Art Theater will convene family members of the theater and nearby residents to hold seminars, hold propaganda evenings, and carry out street propaganda. Professional groups such as the Central Academy of Drama and the Beijing People's Art Theater are also preparing to participate in the propaganda activities of the movement.

    [Our newspaper] In order to respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea, factories in Beijing have held meetings to discuss and prepare to launch extensive and in-depth propaganda among workers. Some factories have also held seminars, and the workers who participated in the seminars unanimously expressed their angry protests against the aggressive acts of American imperialism, and vowed to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and supporting the Korean people's liberation war with practical actions. The workers of the Yanjing Paper Mill are very concerned about the news of the Korean War published in the newspaper every day. Whenever everyone opens the newspaper and sees the news that the People's Army has continuously won victories, and the American aggressors and the South Korean puppet army are fleeing in embarrassment, everyone feels unspeakable excitement. The Propaganda and Education Department of the factory's trade union broadcasts the situation of the Korean War to the entire factory through loudspeakers on the first, third, and fifth days of each week, and also organizes some staff to study and discuss important editorials in the newspapers. After the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea issued a notice to hold a campaign week against American aggression, the factory's trade union more actively prepared for propaganda work. On the 18th, the Propaganda and Education Department of the factory's trade union convened a meeting of cadres and activists, and decided that trade union members and activists should organize temporary propaganda teams to go deep into the workers to carry out propaganda work; each department should organize seminars; publish wall newspapers and slogans against American imperialist aggression; strengthen broadcasting work; and mobilize workers to collectively create quick reports against American imperialist aggression. They also decided to hold a factory-wide seminar on opposing American imperialist aggression and celebrating the victory of the Korean people this Saturday.

    After learning the news that the United States sent troops to invade Korea, the workers of the Beijing Post Office held an emergency discussion meeting. Everyone expressed great indignation and hatred for the despicable behavior of American imperialism and its accomplices; at the same time, they held firm confidence in the great cause of opposing the war of aggression and defending world peace. In the discussion of the parcel section, someone said: "American imperialists provoked the Korean civil war, no matter what excuses they make, they cannot hide the true face of their armed intervention." The cadres of the personnel section said: "We are not afraid of American imperialism; not only are we not afraid, but on the contrary, its further aggression against Korea has increased our hatred for it. American imperialism is just a paper tiger, bluffing; as long as all peace-loving people unite, imperialists will definitely be defeated." The workers of the 20th and 22nd bureaus pointed out more directly in the discussion: Whoever dares to invade us will be eliminated.

    In addition, the Beijing Machine Factory No. 2 Branch held a seminar for staff, and after the director of the branch explained the truth about the American imperialist invasion of Korea and Taiwan, many people expressed their opinions. The trade union of the Machine Factory No. 1 Branch used the weekly worker political study time to explain the situation of the Korean War to the workers. The Beijing Telecommunications Trade Union organized the little teachers of each unit to go to Zhongshan Park on the 18th to listen to lectures on the Korean issue, so that they could convey it to the workers after returning, and then organize everyone to discuss. In the Beijing Urban District Postal Trade Union, some members have written new drum words and new foreign films exposing the crimes of American imperialist aggression, and are preparing to widely publicize them to the workers. The workers of the Beijing Clothing Factory also submitted letters to the factory's staff newspaper, accusing American imperialism of its crimes of aggression. The new poem written by Comrade Liu Jun of the factory, after exposing the conspiracy of Truman the robber to harm the Asian people, issued a loud and powerful call: Asian brothers! Join hands and drive the enemies who are invading us out of Asia!

    最后他指示：这个运动要结合保卫世界和平签名运动进行。这个运动中的工作项目，各个单位在不妨碍生产工作的情况下，可根据自己的具体情况利用一切可能的条件进行宣传；动员各方面的人力，通过报纸、杂志、壁报、绘画、戏剧、电影、歌曲、展览、演讲等各种形式，来做有力的宣传；各厂矿、学校、机关、部队和郊区可分别举行各种会议；动员青年进行街头宣传和农村宣传。
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市民主妇联为了在广大妇女群众中展开反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动，于十八日下午二时半召开各区妇女工作干部及各妇女团体负责人的动员大会，讨论展开运动的具体步骤。各区妇女工作干部都准备与本区文教科配合在成人夜校中进行宣传，并通过妇女代表会议及原有各种生产或学习组织，向分散的家庭妇女展开宣传。各妇女团体有的已经进行了学习和讨论，准备继续用讲演、座谈、小组学习等方式在本团体内部和周围的街坊亲友中进行宣传。
    京市各文艺团体及社教机关在京市文学艺术工作者联合会的领导下，正积极准备广泛展开反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜的宣传活动。剧场业公会决定在剧场门口和场内张贴反美侵略的标语、口号；京剧界、评剧界、曲艺界及“戏曲界讲习班毕业同学会”组织宣传小组，利用各剧场演出休息时间向观众宣传反对美国侵略运动的意义。曲艺界并演唱反对美国侵略的鼓书唱词等。电影院将放映幻灯、字幕、进行宣传。各文化馆、书报阅览室确定这一宣传工作为最近的中心工作，将出刊壁报、黑板报、简报，张贴朝鲜战争形势图，绘制金日成将军像，举办大众讲座及座谈会；并用广播、漫画、连环画、诗歌朗诵、活报剧、曲艺、新洋片、图片展览等方式展开宣传。中国青年艺术剧院将召集该剧院家属及附近居民举行座谈会，举办宣传晚会，展开街头宣传。中央戏剧学院、北京人民艺术剧院等专业团体亦正准备参加运动的宣传活动。
    【本报讯】京市各工厂为了响应中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会的号召，纷纷集会讨论，准备在工人中展开广泛的深入的宣传。有的工厂并已召开了座谈会，参加座谈的工人一致表示对于美帝侵略行为的愤怒抗议，誓以实际行动支援人民解放军解放台湾和支援朝鲜人民所进行的解放战争。燕京造纸厂的工人，对于每天报上登载的朝鲜战事的消息，都非常关心。每当大家翻开报纸，看见人民军连续获得胜利，而美国侵略者和南朝鲜的傀儡军却在狼狈逃窜的消息时，每一个人的心里都有说不出的兴奋。该厂工会宣教部在每周的一、三、五日，用广播器向全厂广播朝鲜战争进行的情况，同时还组织了一些职员学习讨论报纸上的重要社论。在中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会发出举行反对美国侵略运动周的通知后，该厂工会更积极准备宣传工作。十八日，该厂工会宣教部召集干部积极分子开会，决定由工会委员和积极分子组织临时宣传小组，深入工人群众中作宣传工作；各部门组织座谈会；出版反对美帝国主义侵略的壁报和标语；加强广播工作；发动工人集体创作反对美帝国主义侵略的快报等。他们并决定在本星期六，召开全厂的反对美帝国主义侵略和庆祝朝鲜人民胜利座谈会。
    北京邮局的工人在得知美国出兵侵略朝鲜的消息后，曾召开了紧急讨论会。大家对于美帝及其帮凶们的这一卑鄙的行为，表示了极大的愤慨与憎恨；同时对于反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平这一伟大事业则抱着坚强的信心。包裹股的讨论中，有人说：“美帝国主义者挑起朝鲜内战，不论它们制造什么借口，也掩饰不了它武装干涉的真面目。”人事科的干部说：“对于美帝，我们决不害怕；不但不害怕，相反的，由于它对朝鲜的进一步侵略，反而更增加了我们对它的愤恨。美帝只是一只纸老虎，虚张声势；只要一切爱好和平的人民团结起来，帝国主义者就一定要遭到失败。”二十和二十二局的工人们在讨论中，更直截了当地指出：谁若胆敢侵略我们，谁就要被消灭。
    此外，北京机器厂二分厂，曾召开职员座谈会，该分厂厂长向大家说明美帝侵略朝鲜台湾的真象后，许多人都发表了自己的意见。机器一分厂工会，利用每周工人政治学习的时间，向工人讲解朝鲜战争的形势。北京电信工会于十八日组织各单位的小先生到中山公园去听朝鲜问题的讲演，以便于回来后向工人传达，再组织大家进行讨论。北京市区邮政工会中，有些会员已写好了揭露美帝侵略罪行的新鼓词和新洋片，准备向工人广泛宣传。北京被服厂的工人并曾投书该厂职工小报，控诉美帝侵略的罪行。该厂刘俊同志所写的新诗，在揭露杜鲁门强盗残害亚洲人民的阴谋后，发出响亮的有力的呼声：亚洲的兄弟们！携起手来，把侵略我们的敌人哄出亚洲去！
