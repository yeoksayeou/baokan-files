Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: According to TASS, while food prices in Marshall Plan-ized West Germany, especially the prices of staple foods like bread and fats, are rising, the German Democratic Republic is implementing a policy of price reduction.

On July 15th, Eisler, Director of the News Bureau of the German Democratic Republic, announced at a press conference that stores throughout the Republic would begin their fifth price reduction on July 17th. The price reduction will further improve the living standards of the working people. Eisler pointed out that the reason why another price reduction is possible is because the working people of the German Democratic Republic have completed and overfulfilled the national economic plan, and because of the expanded trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

After the new price reduction begins, throughout the German Democratic Republic, the prices of bread, butter, and milk will be reduced by 30 percent, the prices of flour products will be reduced by 33 percent, the prices of meat will be reduced by 35 percent, and the prices of leather shoes, leather goods, photographic equipment, clocks, watches, sewing machines, and bicycles will be reduced by 15 to 33.3 percent.

　　劳动人民生活标准不断提高
    德第五次减低物价
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林十六日讯：当马歇尔化的西德的食粮价格，特别是面包与脂肪之类的主要食品的价格正在上涨的时候，德意志民主共和国却在实行减低物价政策。
    七月十五日，德意志民主共和国新闻局局长艾斯勒在记者招待会上宣布，共和国各商店定于七月十七日开始第五次减价。减价的结果将进一步提高劳动人民的生活标准。艾斯勒指出，再次减价之所以成为可能，乃是由于德意志民主共和国的劳动人民完成并超过完成了国民经济计划，以及由于与苏联及人民民主国家扩展了贸易关系。
    新的减价开始以后，在德意志民主共和国全国各地，面包、奶油及牛奶价格减低百分之三十，面粉制成品的价格减低百分之三十三，肉类价格减低百分之三十五，皮鞋、皮货、照像器材、钟、表、缝衣机及自行车等，减低百分之十五至三十三点三不等。
