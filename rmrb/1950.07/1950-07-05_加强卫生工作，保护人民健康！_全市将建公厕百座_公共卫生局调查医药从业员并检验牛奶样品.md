[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To improve environmental sanitation in the capital and protect the health of the people of Beijing, the city's Hygiene Engineering Bureau has begun to renovate and build new public toilets, and is also guiding the renovation of commercially built public toilets. There are currently 517 public toilets in the city, including 94 built by the government and 423 built commercially. Due to years of disrepair, most are dilapidated and lack fly-proofing and urine drainage facilities. Since March of this year, the bureau has begun a city-wide survey of public toilets and has proposed renovation plans based on the specific conditions of each toilet. Construction started successively in the first, third, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts in May, and work will also begin in the second, fourth, fifth, and ninth districts in the coming days. Regarding the renovation of commercially built public toilets, the Hygiene Engineering Bureau has proposed renovation methods and standards, with the dung merchants themselves responsible for the renovations. With the cooperation of the Hygiene Engineering Bureau, each district has successively convened symposiums of the owners of commercially built public toilets, explaining the relationship between environmental sanitation and the health of citizens. The dung merchants have all expressed their willingness to carry out repairs in accordance with the renovation standards proposed by the government to jointly improve environmental sanitation in the capital.

Regarding the construction of new public toilets, it has been decided to build 100 new public toilets for men and women in suitable locations in various streets, alleys, and public places in the city this year. The bureau has widely solicited opinions from district governments and public security bureaus on the location of the facilities. The survey, measurement, and design work has been basically completed, and ten have already been completed. All renovation and new construction projects will strive to be completed before the end of July.

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to protect the health of citizens and understand the current situation of the pharmaceutical industry in Beijing, the Beijing Public Health Bureau has formed a pharmaceutical investigation team with the United National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Medical Association, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Patent Medicine Industry Association to conduct in-depth investigations of unqualified pharmaceutical practitioners. The investigation team began work on June 27th. The investigation will begin in the sixth district, where there are more hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, and then extend to the entire city. The investigation targets include hospitals, Chinese and Western clinics, pharmacies, pharmaceutical factories, and drug factories. The investigation includes: (1) Whether the hospital equipment is qualified, whether medical staff have obtained licenses, the amount of fees charged, and whether there are any illegal medical practices; (2) Whether clinic doctors have obtained licenses, whether they are personally seeing patients, and whether there are medical records or prescription stubs; (3) Whether pharmacies, drug factories, etc. have obtained licenses, how the equipment is, and whether the sale of narcotics and poisons complies with procedures.

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Most of the dairy farms in Beijing are small in scale and have simple sanitary equipment. In order to protect the health of citizens and enable them to drink suitable milk, the Municipal Public Health Bureau has provided guidance on the environmental sanitation and equipment of various dairy farms, and has extracted milk samples for testing. According to the results of the first test, 45 farms had excessive E. coli and miscellaneous bacteria, excessively low fat content, or excessively low specific gravity. After sending personnel to guide them to improve, 14 farms still failed the second test. The Public Health Bureau then sent personnel to each farm to check the reasons for the failure and provided detailed guidance to the employees. After extracting the third batch of samples for testing, Shi Jin, Jian Feng, Tai Kang, and Nong Shang were still unqualified. After persuasion and education, Nong Shang has now passed the re-examination, and other farms are gradually improving. However, Wan Kang, Jian Chun, Huang He, Qing He, Liu Ji, Yun Ji, and Fu Sheng Rui Ji, have not yet applied for re-examination since the initial test. They are now being urged to declare within a time limit, and if they fail to report within the time limit, appropriate action will be taken.

    【京市新闻处讯】为了改善首都环境卫生，保护京市人民健康，本市卫生工程局已开始整修、新建公共厕所；并指导整修商建公共厕所。全市现在共有公共厕所五百一十七座，内公建者九十四座，商建者四百二十三座，由于年久失修，大多破烂不堪，并缺少防蝇及尿水宣泄等设备。今年三月起该局开始全市公共厕所调查工作，并依据各个厕所具体情况提出了整修计划。五月起先后在第一、三、六、七、八等五个区陆续开工，第二、四、五、九等四个区近日亦可开工。商建公厕的整修，卫生工程局提出整修办法及整修标准，由粪商自己负责整修，并在卫生工程局配合下，各区都先后召集了商建公厕业主的座谈会，说明了环境卫生与市民健康的关系。粪商们都表示愿依据政府提出的整修标准进行修缮，共同搞好首都环境卫生。
    新建公共厕所，决定本年在市内各街巷及公共场所选择适当地点新建男、女公共厕所一百座。对设置地点，该局曾广泛地向各区区公所及公安局征求了意见，现勘查、测量及设计工作已基本完成，且已有十座竣工。全部整修新建工程争取在七月底以前完成。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市公共卫生局为保障市民健康，了解京市医药业现状，特联合国药公会、新药公会、医联会、中医学会、成药公会等单位组成医药调查小组，深入调查不合格的医药从业人员。该调查小组已自六月二十七日开始工作。先调查医院、诊所、药铺较多的第六区，然后推及全市。调查对象为医院、中西诊所、药房、制药社、药厂等。调查内容：（一）医院设备是否合格、医护人员曾否领照、收费多寡及有无非法医疗行为等；（二）诊所大夫曾否领照，是否本人应诊、有无病历或处方存根；（三）药房、药厂等已否领照，设备如何，售卖麻醉药剂和毒药是否合乎手续等。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市牛奶场，大都规模较小，卫生设备简陋，市公共卫生局为了维护市民健康，使能饮到适宜的牛奶，对各牛奶场环境卫生及设备曾予以指导，并提取牛奶样品检验。经第一次检验结果，含有大肠菌、杂菌过多，脂肪过低或比重过低的共有四十五家。经派员指导其改善后，第二次检验时，仍有十四家不合格。公共卫生局再派员前往各场检查不适原因，并对职工详加指导后，提取第三次样品检验，不合格的尚有石金、建丰、泰康、农商等四家，经说服教育，农商一家现已抽验合格，其他各家正逐步改善。惟从初检不适至今尚未申请复检的有万康、建纯、黄河、清和、刘记、云记、福生瑞记等七家，现正在催促限期申报，如逾期不报，即予以适当处理。
