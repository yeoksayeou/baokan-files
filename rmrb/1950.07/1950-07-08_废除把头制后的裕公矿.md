　　Yugong Mine After the Abolition of the Ba Tou System
　　By Our Reporter Lin Li

　　The workers of Yangquan Yugong Coal Mine, freed from the shackles of the feudal Ba Tou (gangmaster) system, are producing with unparalleled enthusiasm.

　　Not long ago, the mine implemented centralized operations and shifted the coal mining area. When moving the machinery, several coal cars were left behind in the flooded mine shaft. At that time, the water in the mine was knee-deep and icy cold. Just as everyone was wondering how to retrieve the coal cars, an elderly worker in his fifties immediately jumped into the water, shouting, "This is state property, it must not be abandoned!" This old worker's name is Li Guanxiang, a Communist Party member. Before the anti-Ba Tou movement, he was an ordinary worker, and now he serves as the deputy head of the transportation section. He had already been without proper sleep for three days and nights. This time, being soaked in the cold water, he fell ill. But he insisted on working without rest. The mine director dragged him to the dormitory, but he quietly returned to his work post. Concerned about the old worker's health, the mine director didn't know whether to comfort him or criticize him. After carefully considering his temperament, the mine director said in a commanding tone, "You go back and rest immediately!" However, the old worker, whose eyes were still shining with fatigue, objected, "Mine Director, I can't sleep even if I lie on the kang!" Because before the anti-Ba Tou movement, the Communist Party members here, like the workers, were oppressed by the Ba Tous and could not hold their heads up. For all the heavy and dangerous work, the Ba Tous would say, "You Communist Party members, take the lead in enduring hardship!" But when evaluating wage points, they would say, "You Communist Party members, enjoy the benefits later." So, if you deserved ninety points, they would give you at most eighty. When the Communist Party members actively started working, the Ba Tous would conspire to sabotage and attack. Li Guanxiang had been attacked by a Ba Tou. That was after the democratic movement last year. Li Guanxiang responded to the call from above, actively worked, and motivated others, becoming a labor model in the Yangquan mines. As a result, he was promoted to production team leader. However, a Ba Tou named Li Guiyuan said, "You're a model?! I think you're just looking for trouble!" As a result, Li was kicked out of the position in a few days. Now, Li Guanxiang says, "The Party has lifted me up again! I have nothing else, only my old strength, and I want to put it all out."

　　Many workers at the Yugong Mine, after overthrowing the feudal Ba Tous, have also contributed all their strength, just like Li Guanxiang. Therefore, this Yugong Mine, which had never completed its production tasks before, surpassed the predetermined task for the first time by 1.8 percent in April, when the anti-Ba Tou struggle was intensely underway. Efficiency has also greatly improved compared to before.

　　With the rise in production efficiency, workers' wages have also generally increased. The workers believe this is because there is no Ba Tou middleman to exploit them. Increased wages, in turn, stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for labor. But in the eyes of the tunneling workers, after the anti-Ba Tou movement, in addition to the general benefits shared by all workers, they also have their special gains. This is what worker Yao Shiyou said: "We can stand up to mine coal!" Originally, they used primitive tools and the backward method of "moving the base and chiseling the ditch" to mine coal. Needless to say, the efficiency was very low, and a person's body would be deformed after mining coal for a few years. Like the old miners we usually see, their shoulders are uneven, their backs are hunched, their waists are bent, and their buttocks are crooked. This is the result of spending years lying on their sides in dark, sunless caves without being able to stand upright to mine coal under this backward method of production. After the anti-Ba Tou movement, the coal mining method of "drilling holes and blasting" was adopted. The workers no longer need to lie on their sides in the mine, but can stand upright to "drill holes." Yao Shiyou, a miner who had spent more than twenty years "moving the base and chiseling the ditch," said, "Before the anti-Ba Tou movement, the new coal mining method was absolutely impossible." Because the Ba Tous were deeply afraid that advanced production methods would break their feudal shackles. Another tunneling worker, Ren Changming, confirmed, "The 'drilling holes and blasting' method was also promoted earlier, but it was blocked by the Ba Tous. The Ba Tous said: 'Yangquan coal cannot be mined without Yangquan methods, it cannot be changed!'" An administrative worker also said, "At that time, we didn't understand the technology, and after listening to the Ba Tous, we blamed the workers, saying, 'Yangquan workers are technically conservative.' Looking back now, this is really an insult to the Yangquan workers!"

　　Yangquan miners "can stand up to mine coal," which means that the younger generation of miners has since broken free from that strange and ugly state, and started their new life!

　　The anti-Ba Tou movement has also changed the unorganized habits of coal mine management and has begun to move towards a disciplined path. According to the mine director, Liang Laiyuan, one of the most troublesome problems they faced before the anti-Ba Tou movement was the inability to accurately grasp the labor force. At that time, there was no system, no discipline. Workers did not register when they came to the mine to work, and did not ask for leave when they left the mine. The mine was like a hotel, and it was always impossible to figure out the exact number of workers. Before the anti-Ba Tou movement, "fixed staffing" was also promoted, but the Ba Tous replied, "That will definitely scare the workers away!" and affirmed, "This is an old rule that has been around for many years, and it cannot be changed." As a result, some administrative leaders also followed the Ba Tous and said, "Yangquan workers are backward and undisciplined."

　　However, after crushing the feudal Ba Tou organizations, the workers were immediately re-registered, and the workers were asked to report how much work they could do each year. As a result, out of more than 1,600 workers, only 84 did not meet the conditions required by the mine for long-term workers. The workers also automatically established "new rules" to ensure that they would work enough for 240 days each year. In this period of more than a month, only three people violated the leave system. So Director Liang said, "Now we have a clear picture in our minds, just like a commander knowing how many troops he has and how much strength he has, we won't fight blind battles in the future."

　　Wu Zhong, the secretary of the Yugong Mine's general branch, believes that the greatest gain of the anti-Ba Tou struggle is that the leading cadres have broken free from the Ba Tous' encirclement and clarified the idea of relying on the working class. He said, "This is an invaluable treasure that cannot be calculated with numbers." Before the anti-Ba Tou movement, the Ba Tous were mistaken for skilled workers, and it was said that the Ba Tous were a force that could be relied upon to develop production, and the conclusion was drawn that the coal mine could not be run well without the Ba Tous. On the contrary, it was said that the workers were backward, conservative, and unawakened. Until the higher authorities instructed the mine leaders to lead the workers to oppose the Ba Tous, they were still doubtful whether the production situation could improve after opposing the Ba Tous. Later, the movement began under the circumstances of "the higher authorities say to oppose, so we will oppose." Until the end of the movement, when the newly elected cadres took office, everyone was still not sure about the achievements of the anti-Ba Tou movement. Because they saw a "worthless fellow" among the newly elected cadres, who had been pointed at the face by the Ba Tous and scolded, "If you can become a leader, then the earth will be pressing on the sky!" However, the facts were completely the opposite, and the "worthless fellow" led very well. At this time, the mine leaders saw the wisdom, enthusiasm, and ability of the workers. With the improvement of the production situation, the strengthening of the workers' organization and discipline, and the smooth implementation of various policies, they felt that leadership was much more convenient. At this time, they deeply realized that the implementation of the anti-Ba Tou movement in the coal mine, just like the land reform that must be implemented in the countryside, is an indispensable revolution for running the coal mine well.

　　废除把头制后的裕公矿
    本报记者  林里
    摆脱了封建把头束缚的阳泉裕公煤矿工人，正在以无比的热情进行生产。
    这矿不久前实行并井集中，转移采煤地区。撤退机器时，几个煤车遗落在矿坑的水里。当时矿内水深没膝，寒冷如冰。正当大家寻思如何打捞煤车的时候，一个五十多岁的老年工人立即跳下水去，大喊着：“这是国家的财产，决不能丢弃！”这个老工人的名字叫李官祥，是共产党员；反把头前是个普通工人，现在担任着运搬股副股长的职务。他原来已有三天三夜没有好好睡觉，这次被冷水一浸，便病倒了。但是他还坚持工作并不休息。矿长把他拉到宿舍里，他又悄悄回到工作岗位去。从关心这位老工人的健康出发，矿长不知道究竟是安慰他好，还是责备他对。在再三考虑了他的性情以后，矿长以命令的口吻说：“你赶快回去休息！”然而这位闪灼着困盹的眼睛的老工人却反对说：“矿长，我躺在炕上也睡不着啊！”因为在反把头以前，这里的共产党员和工人一样被把头们压得抬不起头来，凡是累活、危险地带，把头们就说：“你们共产党员，吃苦在前，带头干吧！”评工资分数时却又说：“你们共产党员，享福在后。”于是应该九十分的，顶多给你八十分。当共产党员们积极干起活来的时候，把头们又阴谋破坏打击。李官祥就曾经被把头打击过。那是去年民主运动后，李官祥响应上级号召，积极劳动，推动别人，成了阳泉各矿的劳动模范。并因此被提拔为生产组长。然而，一个叫李贵元的把头说：“你模范？！我看你是找麻烦！”结果不几天后李被踢了下来。如今，李官祥说：“党又把我扶起来啦！我没有别的，只有一身老劲，我要把它全部拿出来。”
    裕公矿的好多工人，在打倒了封建把头之后，也和李官祥一样，拿出了全部的力量。因此，这座从来没有完成过生产任务的裕公矿，在反把头斗争激烈进行的四月份，便破天荒地第一次超过了预定任务的百分之一点八。效率也比以前大为提高。
    随着生产效率的上升，工人工资也普遍提高了。工人认为这是没有把头中间剥削的缘故。工资提高，反过来又刺激了工人的劳动热情。但在掘进工人看来，反把头以后除了得到一般工人所共有的好处之外，他们还有其特殊的收获。这就是工人姚世有所说的：“我们可以站起来刨煤了！”原来这里，用着原始的工具，以“搬根凿壕”的落后方法刨煤。不用说效率很低，而且一个人刨上几年煤，体格就变形了。像我们通常看到的老矿工，他们两肩不平、背驼、腰弯、屁股歪，就是在这种落后的生产方式下，终年累月侧身倒卧在暗无天日的阴洞里而不能直立起来从事采煤的结果。反把头后采用了“打眼放炮”的刨煤法。工人们再不需要侧身倒卧在矿洞里，而是直立起来“打眼”就行了。那位过了二十多年搬根凿壕生活的矿工姚世有说：“在反把头以前，新刨煤法是万万行不通的。”因为把头们深怕先进的生产方法打碎了他们的封建枷锁。另一掘进工人任常明证实说：“早先也提倡过‘打眼放炮’，可是都叫把头们阻挡住了。把头们说：‘阳泉煤非用阳泉办法刨不下来，不能改！’一位行政工作者也说：“那时我们不懂技术，听了把头的话就埋怨工人说：‘阳泉工人技术保守’。现在检讨起来，这真是对阳泉工人的侮辱啊！”
    阳泉矿工“能够站起来刨煤”，这就是说：青年一代的矿工们从此摆脱了那种奇形怪状的丑态，而开始了他们的新生活！
    反把头运动，也改变了煤矿管理上的漫无组织的习惯，开始走向了纪律化的道路。据该矿梁来元矿长谈：反把头之前，他们最感头疼的问题之一，是不能正确掌握劳动力。那时，没有制度，没有纪律，工人来矿做工不报名，离矿外出不请假。矿厂如同旅店，历来就弄不清工人的确实数字。反把头前虽也提倡过“定员”整理，但把头们回答说：“那，非把工人定跑了不可！”并肯定说：“这是多年来的老规矩，更改不得。”于是，一些行政领导者也就跟着把头说：“阳泉工人落后、散漫。”
    然而，在打垮了封建的把头组织机构之后，随即重新进行工人登记，让工人自报每年能够做多少工。结果，在一千六百多名工人中，只有八十四人不合矿上所要求的长期工人的条件。工人们并自动订立“新规矩”，保证每年做够二百四十个工。在这一个多月的时间里，只有三人违犯了请假制度。所以梁矿长说：“现在我们脑子里有数了，像一个指挥员知道自己有多少队伍，有多大力量一样，往后就不会打盲目仗了。”
    裕公矿总支书记武忠同志认为，反把头斗争的最大收获，是领导干部摆脱了把头的重围，明确了依靠工人阶级的思想。他说：“这是不可以数字计算的无价至宝。”在反把头以前，这里将把头误认为技术工人，说把头是发展生产可以依靠的力量，并得出离开把头办不好煤矿的结论。相反的，说工人落后、保守、不觉悟。直到上级指示要该矿领导工人反把头时，他们还在怀疑反完把头生产情况能否好转。后来在“上级叫反，咱就反。”的情况下开始了运动。直到运动结束，新选干部上任，大家还不敢肯定反把头的成绩。因为他们看到新选干部中有一位“草蛋鬼”，	这人曾被把头们指着脸骂过：“你要能当上个头目，那就地压着天啦！”然而事实完全相反，“草蛋鬼”领导得很好。这时，该矿领导上才看到了工人的智慧、热情与能力。随着生产情况的好转，工人组织性、纪律性的加强，各项政策的顺利贯彻，他们感到领导方便的多了。这时才深刻体会到：煤矿中贯彻反把头运动，也和农村中必须实行土地改革一样，是办好煤矿所必不可缺少的革命。
