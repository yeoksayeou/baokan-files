　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th—A land reform study movement has recently unfolded among teachers and students of secondary and higher schools in Wuhan. The Central South Bureau and the provincial and municipal education leading organs have successively issued instructions, requiring land reform education to be the central content of political and ideological education in schools at all levels. Schools have generally established "Land Reform Study Committees" to strengthen leadership over this study. Schools in the Wuchang and Hanyang districts, under the Political Education Research Association jointly organized by these schools, have also established land reform education working committees in four school districts to guide and promote land reform study in each school. In the course of learning, schools generally first carry out theoretical study of land reform, reading relevant documents and hiring specialists to make reports, and then delve into practice, conduct ideological examination and study aspects of land reform policy. At the beginning of the study, many students and faculty members who were children of industrialists and businessmen, especially students from landlord families, were indifferent to the study of land reform because they could not appreciate the crimes of the landlord class and the suffering of the broad masses of peasants under the feudal exploitation system. In order to enlighten students on the importance of land reform in the national construction undertaking, many schools organized teachers and students to go to the countryside for visits. For example, ninety teachers and students of Hanyang Middle School organized a rural investigation team to visit the rural areas near the school. When they went down, it was right after the rain, and the peasants were busy with watering, wheat threshing, and grinding. They helped the peasants with their work. After the weather cleared, they also saw with their own eyes the peasants sweating hard in the hot sun and the very poor living conditions under landlord exploitation. They realized the justice and urgency of land reform. Hubei Provincial Experimental Middle School also invited Lu Hansheng, an alumnus who had just returned to Wuhan from Henan Province, to report to the school on the situation of land reform in Henan and his ideological gains, which further helped everyone to improve their understanding of land reform. At present, the learning in various schools is being further connected with their own thoughts on the basis of general research. The land reform study at National Wuhan University lasted for one and a half months and ended successfully at the end of May.
    In addition: Recently, the Department of Culture and Education of the Hubei Provincial Government has made a decision to hold a summer training course for primary and secondary school teachers starting from July 20, with land reform policy as the main content of the training.

　　武汉中等以上学校师生
    展开土改问题学习运动
    现正进一步联系个人思想
    【新华社汉口三十日电】武汉市中等以上学校师生最近时期已展开土地改革问题的学习运动。中南区与省市各级教育领导机关曾相继发出指示，要求以土地改革教育为各级学校政治思想教育的中心内容。各学校普遍建立了“土地改革学习委员会”，以加强对这一学习的领导。武昌和汉阳区各学校并在这些学校联合组织的政治教育研究会之下，分别在四个学区设立了土地改革教育工作委员会，以指导和推动各校的土地改革学习。各校在进行学习中，一般先进行土地改革的理论学习，阅读有关文件和聘请专人作报告，以后再深入联系实际，进行思想检查和土地改革政策方面的学习。在学习开始时，有不少工商业者子弟的学生和教职员，特别是出身地主家庭的学生，由于不能体会地主阶级的罪恶与广大农民在封建剥削制度下所遭受的痛苦，对土地改革的学习漠不关心。为了启发学生们认识土地改革在国家建设事业中的重要性，很多学校都组织师生下乡访问。如汉阳中学师生九十人组织了一个农村调查队，到该校附近农村访问。下去时正值雨后，农民们都忙着车水、打麦、推磨等。他们便帮助农民干活。天晴后，他们又亲眼看到农民们在强烈的太阳光下挥汗勤劳耕作和在地主剥削下生活非常贫苦的情形。他们认识了土地改革的正义性和迫切性。湖北省立实验中学还聘请了新从河南省返汉的校友吕汉生到该校报告河南土地改革的情况和自己在思想上的收获，更帮助大家提高了对土地改革的认识。目前各学校的学习，正由一般的研究进一步联系自己的思想。国立武汉大学的土地改革学习，历时一个半月，已于五月底胜利结束。
    又讯：最近湖北省政府文教厅已作出决定，计划自七月二十日起，举办暑期中小学教师讲习会，以土地改革政策为主要的讲习内容。
