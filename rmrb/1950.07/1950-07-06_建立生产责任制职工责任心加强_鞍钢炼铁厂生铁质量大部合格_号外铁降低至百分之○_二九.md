　　Establishing a Production Responsibility System Strengthens Workers' Sense of Responsibility
    Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Iron Smelting Plant Largely Produces Qualified Pig Iron;
    Off-Grade Iron Reduced to 0.29%
    [Our Dispatch] Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant established a production responsibility system, product quality has significantly improved. Last year, the plant's off-grade iron production accounted for 25% of the total pig iron output; in January of this year, it still accounted for more than 15%. However, since the establishment of the production responsibility system in February, off-grade iron decreased to 5% in February, and further dropped to 1.37% in March. After the plant put forward the slogan of eliminating off-grade iron in April, off-grade iron decreased to 0.4%. In May, off-grade iron accounted for an average of only 0.29% of the total pig iron output, and almost all products met the specifications for steelmaking and casting pig iron.
    Especially in May, after the engineers and technicians of a certain blast furnace put forward the "1, 1, 3" fighting goal (that is, when manufacturing low-silicon steelmaking iron, the silicon content in the iron should only account for 1%, the manganese content 1%, and the sulfur content below 0.03%), the average silicon content of steelmaking pig iron for the whole month was reduced to 1.05%, the manganese content 1.05%, and the sulfur content 0.06%, creating a new record unprecedented in the history of Anshan Iron and Steel. The successful manufacture of low-silicon steelmaking pig iron can reduce the production process of the preliminary refining furnace and directly add molten iron to the open hearth furnace for steelmaking, thus relatively increasing the output of steel and greatly reducing the cost.
    In the past, no one cared about the plant producing off-grade iron. After the establishment of the production responsibility system in February, it was stipulated that a review should be conducted for producing off-grade iron, the cause should be investigated, and a written report should be submitted afterward. In this way, the sense of responsibility of all employees in the plant was strengthened, and the connection between employees was also strengthened. They studied the raw materials and the condition of the furnace, exchanged operational opinions, tried to reduce unnecessary material changes, and carefully adjusted wind temperature, air volume, wind pressure, etc., to stabilize the furnace condition. In addition, a production reporting system was established to be held every afternoon to understand the production situation of the day and to raise and solve problems that needed to be solved in a timely manner; a Saturday technical symposium was established to study the problems that occurred in batching and operation, so as to exchange experience and improve technology; the responsibility system of engineers was strengthened, and an engineer opinion book was established, inviting engineers to give opinions on the operation policies of the three-shift technicians; a ten-minute review meeting was established after work, with technicians and workers participating together to review the operation situation and the advantages and disadvantages of the shift, and to tell the next shift the situation in detail and responsibly. The plant formally promulgated the operating technical regulations in April, further inspecting the production responsibility system. At the beginning of May, a merit and demerit book was established to turn commendation and criticism into a mass system, and statistical tables of commendation and criticism were made to establish a sense of righteousness. Under the guarantee of these systems, all employees of the plant established a strong sense of responsibility. For example, as a result of strengthening inspections, the raw material class inspected 3,000 kilograms of refractory bricks, many pieces of cement, and more than 20 iron rods in the ore, improving the quality of the ore.
    The Party played a guaranteeing role in implementing the responsibility system, creating a mass-based system of commendation and criticism; organized four mutual visits to drive the backward with the advanced; organized two symposiums of good Party members to introduce typical materials of good Party members; and at the same time called on all Party members to learn from Meng Tai, special-class labor hero of Anshan Iron and Steel and a Party member. Under the leadership of Party members, the responsibility system was universally established among the masses.

### 建立生产责任制职工责任心加强  鞍钢炼铁厂生铁质量大部合格  号外铁降低至百分之○·二九

　　建立生产责任制职工责任心加强
    鞍钢炼铁厂生铁质量大部合格
    号外铁降低至百分之○·二九
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂建立生产责任制以后，产品质量已显著提高。去年该厂号外铁产量占全部生铁产量百分之二十五，今年一月份仍占百分之十五以上。但自二月份建立生产责任制以来，二月份号外铁减少到百分之五，三月份又下降到百分之一点三七；四月份该厂提出消灭号外铁的口号后，号外铁减少到百分之○点四，五月份号外铁平均仅占生铁总产量的百分之○点二九，产品几乎全部合于制钢和铸造生铁的规格。
    尤其在五月份，某高炉的工程师和技术员提出“一、一、三”的奋斗目标（即要求制造低矽制钢铁时，铁内含矽量仅占百分之一，含锰量百分之一，含硫量百分之○点○三以下）后，全月制钢生铁平均含矽量降低为百分之一点○五，含锰百分之一点○五，含硫百分之○点○六，创造了鞍钢史无前例的新纪录。低矽制钢生铁的制造成功，可减少预备精炼炉这一生产过程，直接将熔铁加入平炉炼钢，因之钢的产量相对增加，成本也大大降低。
    过去该厂出号外铁是无人过问的。从二月建立生产责任制后，规定出号外铁要作检讨，追究原因，事后并须做书面报告。这样，全厂职工的责任心加强了，职工之间也加强了联系，研究原料和炉的情况，交换操作意见，尽量减少不必要的变料，同时谨慎地调节风温、风量、风压等，使炉况稳定起来。此外，并建立了每天下午举行的生产汇报制，以了解当天生产情况，提出并解决需要及时解决的问题；建立了星期六技术座谈会，研究配料及操作上发生的问题，借此交流经验，提高技术；加强了工程师的责任制，建立了工程师意见簿，请工程师对三班技术员在操作方针上提出意见；建立了下班后十分钟检讨会，技术员与工友一块参加，检讨本班操作情况及优点、缺点，把情况详细负责地告诉下一班。该厂在四月份又正式颁布了操作技术规程，进一步检查了生产责任制。五月初又建立了功过簿，使表扬和批评变为群众性的制度，并且制出表扬和批评的统计表，树立了正气观念。在这些制度的保证下，该厂全体职工树立了坚强的责任心。例如原料班因加强检查的结果在矿石中检查出耐火砖三千公斤，及许多洋灰块子和二十多根铁棒子，提高了矿石的质量。
    党在贯彻责任制中，起了保证作用，创造了群众性的表扬和批评制度；组织了四次互相参观，以先进带动落后；组织了两次好党员座谈会，介绍了好党员的典型材料；同时号召全体党员向鞍钢特等功臣、党员孟泰同志学习。在党员带头之下，责任制在群众中普遍树立起来。
