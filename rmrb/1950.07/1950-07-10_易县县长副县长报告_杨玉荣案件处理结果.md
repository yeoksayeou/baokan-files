　　Report from the County Head and Deputy County Head of Yi County on the Handling of the Yang Yurong Case

To the Editors:

　　After reading the article "Yang Yurong Detained for Appealing to This Newspaper" published in the People's Daily on June 8th, we dispatched personnel twice to conduct in-depth investigations in the village (Dongrubao). We now report the investigation results and handling process as follows:

　　In 1946, due to the poor environment in the village (then under Dingxing County, close to the Kuomintang-controlled area), some people were hesitant and did not want the landlords' land. Therefore, five mu of land were temporarily managed and cultivated by the village's military committee. In 1949, Zhang Dexiang, the director of the village's military committee, was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the land was left unmanaged. Yang Yurong (then the director of the farmers' association) privately took over the cultivation of these five mu of land without the consent of others. However, Yang's family consisted of only four people, and they were allocated a total of 21.1 mu of land. The original 2.5 mu of land had already been sold in the "May Fourth" re-examination. Yang's land exceeded the village's average land per person (four mu). Therefore, the masses expressed dissatisfaction and disagreed with him continuing to cultivate the five mu of land. In November 1949 (when the village had been incorporated into Yi County), before the land ownership certificates were issued in the village, after discussion by the village representative meeting, it was decided to allocate the previously unallocated land and houses, and to determine land and housing rights. Among them, the five mu of land cultivated by Yang Yurong was allocated to Li Wenbo, a disaster victim who migrated from Renqiu County (a family of nine, allocated a total of 15 mu of land). However, Yang Yurong disagreed and requested the county civil affairs section to continue to allocate it to him for cultivation. The county government's opinion was to continue to implement the decision of the village representatives. However, Yang still disagreed. It was delayed until the thirteenth day of the third lunar month this year (the start of spring plowing). When the village saw that Yang Yurong had planted wheat on the land that had been taken from him, they took five mu from Yang's twelve mu of land (the county did not know about this) and allocated it to Li Wenbo. Li immediately planted two mu of millet on this land. However, Yang Yurong actually plowed up all the millet planted by Li in the field. Li Wenbo went to the county to file a complaint. The county court and civil affairs section summoned Yang Yurong several times without success. On May 30th (the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month), when there was a big market in Beidong Village (the location of the district), Yang Yurong and his wife went to sell scallions. Sun Rong, a district cadre (district propaganda committee member), saw Yang and asked him to go to the district. Yang Yurong said, "What am I going to do at the district government? I'm not going!" Later, Li Jinrui, the district brigade leader, and two others went to ask Yang Yurong to go to the district, but he still refused. At that time, he and his wife said in a tough tone, "What do you want me for?!" Li said, "Don't you know what's going on with your case?" Yang said, "I discussed it with the newspaper!" Li said, "Isn't it the same wherever you discuss it?!" Then Yang's wife, Xue Wenqin, said, "Oh, you're so overbearing?!" Li said, "What am I being overbearing about! If you don't go, I'll dare to tie you up! Your mistake is big enough to get your head chopped off!" Then they threatened Yang Yurong to the district, and the civil affairs assistant immediately wrote a letter of introduction and sent two members of the village militia team to escort Yang Yurong to the county. When Yang was sent to the county government, Li Wenbo, carrying a quilt and wearing a blue uniform, said to the militiamen at the entrance of the district office, "Yang's case is important. If he runs away, you'll be responsible!" Therefore, when militiaman Xue Ren left the village, he tied up Yang Yurong and only untied him outside the gate of the county government. The court immediately detained Yang and only learned the details of the matter during the interrogation the next day (May 31st).

    Our review and handling opinions on this case:

    (1) The five mu of land cultivated by Yang Yurong should have been taken back, but it was wrong to take five mu from his twelve mu of land and allocate it to Li Wenbo. This is because the county and district did not have an in-depth understanding of the problem and did not handle it in a timely manner, and there was a careless and bureaucratic work style.

    (2) It was wrong for the district to send armed personnel to escort Yang Yurong to the county. It was also wrong for the court to detain him without interrogation and then fail to release him after clarifying the situation the next day. This shows how serious the bureaucratic and commandist leadership of the public security organs is (a review has already been conducted).

    (3) It is unreasonable for Yang Yurong to cultivate these five mu of land, and it should be taken back and reallocated to farmers who lack land or have little land. Since Li Wenbo is a doctor and cannot participate in labor himself (he has already rented out the land allocated to him), this five mu of land cannot be assigned to him again.

    (4) Li Jinrui's work attitude was not good, and it was wrong to order Yang to go to the district in a threatening manner. In addition to giving him criticism and education, he will be ordered to go to the village to apologize to Yang. The Beidong Village militia members will also be given criticism and education for illegally detaining people and infringing on human rights.

### 易县县长副县长报告  杨玉荣案件处理结果

　　易县县长副县长报告
    杨玉荣案件处理结果编者同志：
    读到六月八号人民日报刊登的“因为到本报申诉杨玉荣竟被扣押”一文后，曾先后两次派专人到该村（东茹堡）深入调查。今将调查结果和处理经过报告如下：
    一九四六年，该村（当时属定兴县）因环境不好（距国统区近），个别群众有顾虑，不敢要地主的土地，于是有五亩地暂由村武委会代管耕种。一九四九年该村武委会主任张德祥被国民党反动派杀死，此地即无人经营。杨玉荣（当时任农会主任）未经他人同意，私自接种了这五亩地。但杨全家仅四口人，分得的土地共二十一亩一分地。其原有二亩半地已在五四复查中出卖了。杨的土地超过全村每人平均土地数（四亩）。于是群众对此事表示不满，不同意将五亩地再归他种。一九四九年十一月间（当时该村已划归易县）在该村发土地证前，经村代会讨论后，决定分配过去未分配之土地、房屋、确定了地权、房权。其中杨玉荣所种的五亩地被分配给由任邱县迁来的灾民李文波（全家九口人，共分得十五亩地）。但杨玉荣不同意，要求县民政科继续分给他种。县府的意见是仍照村代表的决议执行。但杨依然不同意。延至本年阴历三月十三日（春耕开始），村中见杨玉荣被抽之地种上了麦子，即从杨的十二亩地内抽出五亩（关于这事县里不知道）拨给了李文波。李随即在此地种上了二亩谷。但杨玉荣竟将李在地里种的谷子全部犁毁。李文波到县控告。县法院和民政科曾数次传唤杨玉荣未果。五月三十号（即阴历四月十五日），北东村（区所在地）正赶大集，杨玉荣夫妻二人去卖葱。区干部孙荣（区宣传委员）见杨后即叫他到区。杨玉荣说：“我到区政府去干啥？不去！”后又由区大队长李金瑞等二人去叫杨玉荣赴区，但他仍不去。当时他们夫妻二人态度强硬地说：“叫我干啥？！”李说：“你个人的事还不知道吗？”杨说：“我到报社讨论了！”李说：“你上那里讨论还不是一样吗？！”。接着杨妻薛文琴说：“啊，你这么横啊？！”李说：“我横什么！你不去，我还敢绑你呢！你的错误大一些还杀你的头呢！”随即将杨玉荣威胁到区，并立刻由民政助理开了介绍信，派了村小队两名，把杨玉荣押送到县。杨被送县府时，李文波背着被包，穿着蓝制服在区公所门口与小队员说：“杨这案子重要，他要是跑了，你们得负责！”因此小队员薛仁出村时即把杨玉荣绑上，送到县府大门外才解开。法院当即将杨扣押，至次日（五月三十一日）审讯时始知事情的底细。
    我们对这个案件的检讨和处理意见：
    （１）杨玉荣种的五亩地是应该抽出的，但不应由他的十二亩地内抽出五亩分与李文波。这是由于县区对问题了解不深入和处理不及时，工作上存在着粗枝大叶的官僚主义作风。
    （２）区派武装押送杨玉荣赴县是错误的。法院当时未加审讯即将他押起来，而次日问清原委后又未将他释放，这也是错误的。这说明公安机关领导上的官僚主义和命令主义是何等严重（已作检讨）。
    （３）杨玉荣种这五亩地是不合理的，应当抽出另行分配给缺地或少地的农民耕种。而李文波系一医生，个人不能参加劳动（他已把分得之地租出去），故此五亩地不能再确定给他。
    （４）李金瑞工作态度不好，用威胁方式令杨赴区是不对的。除给予批评教育外，并令其赴该村向杨道歉。北东村民兵私自绑人侵犯人权，也给予批评教育处分。
