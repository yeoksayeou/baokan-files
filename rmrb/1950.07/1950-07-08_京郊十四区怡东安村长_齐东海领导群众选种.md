　　Qi Donghai, Village Chief of Yidongan Village in the 14th District of Beijing Suburbs, Leads the Masses in Seed Selection

　　Qi Donghai (Communist Party member), the village chief of Yidongan Village in the 14th District of Beijing suburbs, actively led the masses in seed selection and achieved good results. The village was one of the severely affected villages in the 14th District, with 90% of the crops flooded, resulting in only 20-30% of a normal harvest. Therefore, last year when sowing wheat, everyone felt the difficulty of lacking wheat seeds. The whole village sowed more than 2,000 mu of wheat. The government loaned wheat seeds to solve the problem for 650 mu, and the rest was solved by the masses themselves. Therefore, this year's wheat is very mixed, often with three or four varieties in one field, which caused some to die from jaundice and black jaundice.

　　At the seed selection meeting, Qi Donghai said: "This year the wheat is not good, it is impossible for everyone to select seeds in their own fields. Village cadres should be responsible for seed selection, and ask the masses for their opinions. Whoever's wheat is good will be selected, but it must be with the consent of the person. After the wheat is harvested, it will be exchanged according to the market price under the principle of not suffering losses on both sides." Everyone agreed with Qi Donghai's opinion.

　　Subsequently, mass meetings were held in various natural villages to promote unified seed selection. The masses said: "This year the wheat is generally suffering from jaundice. Only 'Little Red Sesame' and 'Bald Head Wheat' can resist disasters, but our village lacks such seeds. What should we do?" Qi Donghai used his spare time at noon to personally go to the fields to check, and after finding good wheat, he discussed it with the wheat owner. Farmer Zhou Gangqiang had six mu of good "Little Red Sesame" wheat, and Qi Donghai mobilized him to exchange it with other villagers. He said: "If our village plants good wheat seeds, next year we will have a good harvest, and everyone's life will be better." After Qi Donghai personally mobilized and inspected, the 230 mu of wheat land in the 22nd District finally completed the seed selection work. The masses were very satisfied. Hired laborer Zuo Jiantang even voluntarily went to the village chief to ask for his "Little Red Sesame" wheat to be selected.

　　Now the seed selection work in the village is nearing completion. According to current statistics, only 22 households have been selected, totaling 230 mu. If each mu can yield 75 jin (totaling 17,250 jin), it can sow 1,437.5 mu (each mu requires 12 jin of seeds). Coupled with the wheat seeds selected by the masses themselves, it can basically solve the difficulty of wheat seeds in the village this year. (Zhu Jinyao)

### 京郊十四区怡东安村长  齐东海领导群众选种

　　京郊十四区怡东安村长
    齐东海领导群众选种
    京郊十四区怡东安村长齐东海（中共党员），积极领导群众进行选种，并获得了很好的成绩。该村为十四区重灾村之一，百分之九十的庄稼被淹，仅见二三成的年景。因此在去年种麦时，大家都感到缺乏麦籽的困难。全村共种二千多亩麦子，由政府贷麦籽解决了六百五十亩的种籽问题，其余是群众自己设法解决的。所以今年的麦子很杂，往往一块地里就有三四样品种，以致好些生了黄疸、黑疸病死掉了。
    选种会上，齐东海说：“今年麦子不好，大家不可能都在自己地里选种。应该由村干负责选种，请群众提意见，谁的麦子好，就选谁的，但必需经本人同意。等打下麦子，根据市价，在两不吃亏的原则下进行交换。”大家都赞成齐东海的意见。
    随后就在各自然村召开群众会，宣传统一选种。群众都说：“今年麦子普遍生疸，只有小红芝，秃头麦能抗灾，可是咱村缺少这样的种子，怎么办呢？”齐东海就利用中午空闲时间，亲自到地里去看，看好了就和麦主商量。农民周刚强有六亩上好小红芝麦子，齐东海就动员他和别的群众交换。他说：“咱村要是都种下好麦籽，明年丰收了，大家的日子都好过了。”二十二区的二百三十亩麦地，经过齐东海亲自动员亲自检查，终于完成了选种工作。群众非常满意。雇农左建堂还自动到村长那里，叫选他的小红芝小麦。
    现在该村选种工作将近结束，据现在统计全村只选了二十二户共二百三十亩。如每亩能打七十五斤（合一万七千二百五十斤），可播种一千四百三十七亩半（每亩需种籽十二斤），再加上群众自选的麦种，基本上可解决本村今年麦籽的困难。              （朱金耀）
