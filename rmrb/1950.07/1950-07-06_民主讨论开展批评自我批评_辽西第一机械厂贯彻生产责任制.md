(Jinzhou News from this newspaper) The Liaoxi Province No. 1 Machine Factory is implementing the production responsibility system, and after checking its work and solving problems, it has entered the stage of formulating regulations.

The inspection work was carried out in two groups: one was the workshop inspection group, which mainly inspected the production plan, progress, machinery and equipment, tool and spare parts storage, product quality, rework, waste, labor organization, and labor discipline of each workshop. The inspection group was composed of the factory director, the head of the planning section, the head of the engineering section, technicians, the chairman of the trade union, the heads of the workshop teams, and staff members of the Provincial Department of Industry working group. The other was the administrative and security inspection group, which mainly inspected the work plan and progress of each section, raw materials, the various regulations that had been formulated, and security equipment. This group was composed of the head of the administrative section, representatives of each section, and staff members of the Provincial Department of Industry working group. The inspection groups organized the results of the inspection, reported them, and put forward opinions, which were summarized by the director of the department. Important issues were also discussed at the department's office meetings.

In the in-depth inspection, problems were discovered, and they were solved in a timely, planned, and step-by-step manner, according to their importance and urgency. Major problems were concentrated on for a concentrated attack. For example, the factory's May production plan had not been put forward by May 5, which resulted in more than half of the workers having no work to do. Therefore, the strength of the working group was immediately concentrated to help the planning section formulate a production plan. When major problems that needed to be solved urgently were encountered, the factory immediately applied to the higher authorities for help. For example, the factory was making windlasses for the Nonferrous Metals Administration, but due to errors in cost calculation and underestimation of the price, it was losing a lot of money, but it could not be postponed or not done. Later, with the letter of certification from the higher authorities and the strong assistance of the supply and marketing department, the problem was solved, which increased the workers' confidence in production.

Based on the actual situation learned in the inspection and the current problems, and after democratic discussion, various responsibility systems were formulated to ensure that every task in the factory had a dedicated person in charge. Administrative departments discussed the time and quality of products, the relationship between departments, and the various systems that must be observed, with the section as the unit; production departments discussed these issues with the workshop as the unit. In particular, clear provisions were made for the planning, design, review, and estimation of labor and materials of the planning section. In addition, thirteen systems were enriched or established, including the finished product inspection system, the tool collection system, on-site discipline, the power usage inspection system, the factory rules financial management system, the material allocation system, and the duty system.

The factory's experience proves that the establishment and implementation of the production responsibility system must go through democratic discussion and carry out criticism and self-criticism. For example, many of the regulations and rules established by the factory in the past were made administratively and had not been discussed by the workers, so they became mere formalities. At the beginning of the establishment of the responsibility system, some leading cadres were nitpicking in the inspection work and held others responsible, and did not conduct in-depth reviews of the many existing problems; some trade union cadres and workers also had a purely welfare-oriented view to some extent. Therefore, if these problems are not solved through criticism and self-criticism, the establishment and implementation of the production responsibility system will inevitably be greatly hindered.

### 民主讨论开展批评自我批评  辽西第一机械厂贯彻生产责任制

　　民主讨论开展批评自我批评
    辽西第一机械厂贯彻生产责任制
    【本报锦州讯】辽西省第一机械厂贯彻生产责任制，经过检查工作和解决问题，进入制定规程阶段。
    检查工作分两组进行：一个是车间检查小组，主要检查各车间的生产计划、进度、机械设备、工具备品保管、产品质量、反工、浪费、劳动组织、劳动纪律等项工作。该检查组由厂长、计划科长、工务科长、技师、工会主任、车间班组长及工业厅工作组工作人员等参加。另一个是行政、保安检查组，主要检查各科的工作计划、进度、原材料、已制定的各种规程、保安设备等。该组由行政科长、各科代表及工业厅工作组工作人员等参加。检查组将检查的结果经过整理，汇报并提出意见，由厅长进行总结，有关重要问题，亦在厅务会议进行讨论。
    在深入检查中发现了问题，即分别轻重缓急，及时地、有计划有步骤地予以解决，并对主要问题集中力量进行突击。例如该厂五月份生产计划到五月五号还没有提出来，致使半数以上的工人没有活干。于是当即集中了工作组的力量，帮助计划科制订生产计划；遇到急待解决的重大问题时，立即申请上级帮助解决。如该厂给有色金属管理局做卷扬机，因成本计算错误、估价太低、赔钱很大，但又不能延期或不做；后经上级写信证明，及供销部门的有力协助，即获得解决，增加了职工的生产信心。
    根据检查中所了解的实际情况，及当前存在的问题，又经过民主讨论，制订了各种责任制，使工厂任何一件工作都做到有专人负责。行政部门以科为单位、生产部门以车间为单位，分别讨论了产品的时间、质量，各科间的关系，各种必须遵守的制度等问题；尤其对于计划科的计划、设计、审核、估工估料等项更明确地作了规定。此外，充实或建立了十三种制度，包括成品检查制、工具领取制度、现场纪律、动力使用检查制、厂规财务管理制、拨料制、值班制等。
    该厂经验证明：建立与贯彻生产责任制，必须经过民主讨论，展开批评与自我批评。例如该厂过去建立的许多规程条例都是行政上搞出来的，没有经过工人讨论，因而流于形式。在开始建立责任制时，部分领导干部对检查工作，追究责任是吹毛求疵，对存在的很多问题不作深刻检讨；若干工会干部和工人也多少存在单纯福利观点，因此对这些问题如不开展批评与自我批评予以解决，生产责任制的建立和贯彻势必受到很大的阻碍。
