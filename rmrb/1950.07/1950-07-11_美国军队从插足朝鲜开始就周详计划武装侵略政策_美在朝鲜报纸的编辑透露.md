Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from New York: The U.S. "Daily Worker" published an interview with Kronsky, former editor of the U.S. Army Department's official newspaper in Korea, "Korea Pictorial." Kronsky revealed: "The current armed attack on the Korean People's Democratic Movement is the result of a meticulously planned policy that began when U.S. troops first set foot on Korean soil." Kronsky insisted that this policy aimed to maintain the semi-feudal and colonial status of South Korea, and he personally witnessed the implementation of this policy while at the U.S. Army Headquarters in Korea. Kronsky said: "Before Japan's surrender in 1945, hundreds of underground people's committees were established throughout Korea. These were democratic groups representing the vast majority of workers and peasants. Before the U.S. authorities even landed in Korea, these committees had formed the Korean People's Republic, encompassing both North and South Korea, and drafted programs for land reform, industrialization, and the punishment of pro-fascist traitors. The U.S. occupying military government declared this republic illegal, and the Syngman Rhee government, supported by the U.S. military, launched a rampant campaign of terror against all progressive groups in Korea." Kronsky declared: "I personally saw the dungeons built in the basement of Syngman Rhee's palatial residence. He kept kidnapped trade union leaders in these dungeons, extorting ransoms to fund his terrorist organization." U.S. military government officials were well aware of these matters.

The military government not only maintained Japan's thought control plan but also promulgated Ordinance No. 55 on February 20, 1946—the so-called "Political Party and People's Organization Registration Law." This law stipulated that every member of each political party must register and personally sign, and the party's leading organs were collectively responsible for the actions of each member. The military government also continued to implement the laws of the Japanese aggressors, namely: all gatherings of three or more people were illegal.

Immediately following the start of the U.S. occupation, demonstrators in Incheon were shot by Japanese police. Although the Americans had arrived, the Japanese police still retained their weapons, and they were able to kill and arrest Korean workers with impunity. In the following days, when workers demanded severance pay due to factory layoffs and held strikes and demonstrations against factory owners, the U.S. military police rushed to suppress the strikes and demonstrations to "maintain law and order."

Kronsky said: I personally saw some American soldiers go out in military trucks at night, abduct Korean workers on their way home, beat them severely, and sometimes, with the encouragement of U.S. officials, even kill them.

　　美国军队从插足朝鲜开始就周详计划武装侵略政策
    前美在朝鲜报纸的编辑透露
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：美国工人日报刊载前美国陆军部在朝鲜的官方报纸“朝鲜写真报”编辑克朗斯基的访问记。克朗斯基透露：“目前对朝鲜人民民主运动的武装进攻，乃是经过周详计划的政策的结果，这个政策在美国军队一插足朝鲜土地时便已开始实行”。克朗斯基力言，这个政策旨在维持南朝鲜的半封建殖民地状态，他在美国驻朝鲜陆军总部时曾亲眼看到这个政策的实行。克朗斯基说：“在一九四五年日本投降以前，朝鲜各地即成立了几百个地下人民委员会。这些都是代表绝大多数工农群众的民主团体。美国当局还没有在朝鲜登陆，这些委员会就已经组成了包括南北朝鲜在内的朝鲜人民共和国，拟制了土地改革、工业化及惩办亲法西斯卖国贼的纲领。美国占领军政府把这共和国宣布为非法，由美国军方支持的李承晚政府，对朝鲜一切的进步团体展开了肆无忌惮的恐怖运动。”克朗斯基宣称：“我亲自看见了建筑在李承晚富丽堂皇的住宅的地下室中的地牢。他将被绑架的工会领袖们关在这些地牢中，勒索赎金，以资助他的恐怖组织。”对于这些事情，美国军政府的官员们都知道得很清楚。
    军政府不仅依然维持日本的思想统制计划，而且在一九四六年二月二十日公布了五十五号法令——所谓“政党及人民团体登记法”。这一法令规定各政党的每个党员登记并亲自签名，还要党的领导机关集体负责每一党员的行动。军事政府还继续施行日本侵略者的法令，即：一切在三人以上的集会都是非法的。
    紧随在美国占领开始以后，仁川的示威者们竟被日本警察开枪射击。虽然美国人已经到达了，日本警察都仍然保有武器，他们枪杀与逮捕朝鲜工人，但还能逍遥法外。在以后几天中，当工人们因工厂解雇而要求发给遣散费并对工厂厂主举行罢工和示威时，美国宪兵便赶忙镇压罢工与示威，以“维持法令与秩序。”
    克朗斯基说：我亲自看见有些美军晚上乘军用卡车外出，在路上诱捕回家的朝鲜工人，毒殴他们，有时，在美国官员的鼓励下还杀害他们。
