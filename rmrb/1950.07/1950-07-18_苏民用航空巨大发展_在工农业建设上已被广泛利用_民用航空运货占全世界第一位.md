　　Moscow, TASS, 16th dispatch via Xinhua News Agency: Marshal of Aviation Shavoronkov, Head of the Central Administration of Civil Aviation of the Soviet Union, spoke to a TASS reporter on the eve of Aviation Day and published an article in the Red Star newspaper, discussing the development of Soviet civil aviation, stating: Soviet aviation personnel have successfully completed the tasks stipulated in the post-war Five-Year Plan. In a short period, they have not only restored the pre-war route network, but also greatly expanded it. Moscow, the largest air transport station in the Soviet Union, is now connected by air with seventy-five cities across the country. New direct routes have been established in all major administrative regions of the Soviet Union. In 1948, the total length of Soviet air routes had greatly exceeded the total length of domestic air routes in the United States. Soviet civil aviation's cargo transport ranks first in the world. A rough work schedule for the aviation industry in the national economy includes: transporting urgently needed goods to construction sites, industrial and agricultural sites, fertilizing farmland, killing pests in forest belts, forest fire prevention work, aerial inspection of rafts, aerial exploration of fish schools and marine animal gathering places, aerial geological surveys, aerial mapping, spraying pesticides on malaria-infested swamps by aircraft, and aerial rescue, etc.

　　Shavoronkov said: Socialist land ownership enables aviation expertise to be applied on a large scale in agriculture. Large-scale fertilization by aircraft has proven to increase grain production by five to ten centners per hectare compared to manual fertilization. Due to its remarkable effectiveness, an increasing number of collective farms are booking aircraft for fertilization. In the past two years, the scope of aircraft fertilization has expanded thirty times, and this spring, aircraft have been used to fertilize winter crops four times.

　　Shavoronkov continued: Last year, aircraft were used to kill forest pests in the Voronezh, Saratov, Stalingrad, and Rostov regions, as well as the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, with remarkable results. In Uzbekistan, aircraft were used to sow thorny shrubs that grow in the desert to fix the sand, and achievements have also been made.

　　Shavoronkov pointed out that the Soviet air traffic network has increased several times compared to 1940. The health care network equipped with ambulance planes serves all regions of the country, and their main task now is to transport specialized doctors to people in remote areas.

　　Shavoronkov finally described the achievements of outstanding Soviet pilots, stating: Soviet pilots are proficient in modern aviation technology. Six hundred pilots, aviation mechanics, and radio operators have been awarded the "Million Kilometer Flight Medal," and twenty-two pilots have received this award twice. The oldest pilot, Novikov, and the old mechanic, Monakhov, have flown more than three million kilometers.

　　苏民用航空巨大发展
    在工农业建设上已被广泛利用
    民用航空运货占全世界第一位
    【新华社十六日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联中央民用航空管理处处长空军元帅沙伏隆科夫，在航空节前夕向塔斯社记者发表谈话，并在红星报发表专文，论述苏联民用航空的发展称：苏联航空人员已顺利地完成了战后五年计划所规定的任务，在短期内，不仅恢复了战前的航线网，而且还大大地扩展了航线网。苏联最大的空运站莫斯科，与全国的七十五座城市都有了航空联系。苏联的各大行政区都已建立了新的直达航线。一九四八年苏联航空线的总长度，就已大大超过了美国国内航空线的总长度。苏联民用航空的货运占全世界第一位。航空界在国民经济上的粗略的工作表是：载运建筑现场、工业和农业所急需的货物，为农田施肥，为森林带驱杀害虫，森林消防工作，空中视察木筏，空中探寻鱼群与海兽麇集地，空中调查地质，空中测绘，用飞机向传染疟疾的沼泽地喷射药剂和空中救护等等。
    沙伏隆科夫称：社会主义的土地所有制，使航空专业得以大规模在农业上应用。用飞机进行大规模的施肥工作，已证明可使每公顷土地比手工施肥增产五至十生丁纳的谷物。由于它的显著成效，预约飞机施肥的集体农场已日益增多。过去两年来，飞机施肥的工作范围已扩大了三十倍，今春已用飞机为冬季农作物施肥四次。
    沙伏隆科夫继称：去年，在佛罗内茨、萨拉托夫、斯大林格勒和罗斯托夫各州以及巴什基尔自治共和国内，都使用了飞机驱杀森林害虫，成效卓著。在乌兹贝克，用飞机播种在沙漠中生长的多刺灌木，以使沙土固定下来，也已获得了成绩。
    沙伏隆科夫指出：苏联的航空交通网已比一九四○年增加数倍。备有救护机的保健网，为全国一切地区服务，现在他们的主要任务，是给偏僻地区的人民运送专门医师。
    沙伏隆科夫最后描述苏联的卓越飞行员的成绩称：苏联飞行员精通现代航空技术。六百名驾驶员、航空机械师和无线电服务员已荣膺“飞行百万公里奖章”，二十二名驾驶员曾两度获得此项奖章。而年事最长的驾驶员诺维科夫和老机械师摩那霍夫，已飞行过三百多万公里了。
