Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: Pravda published an editorial on the 9th entitled "Expanding the Front for the Struggle for Peace," stating that the historical significance of the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal lies in its uniting of the broadest masses of people around the banner of peace. Now, this movement has unfolded in various countries around the world and has expanded to segments of the population that had not previously participated in the struggle to defend peace.

Pravda pointed out: The events of the recent weeks have demonstrated that the American ruling clique has moved from preparing aggression to taking direct aggressive actions. The primary fighting task facing all peace-loving people is to thwart the sinister plans of the American warmongers at any cost. This requires peace advocates to further expand the mass base of the peace movement, ensuring that all honest people on earth, all citizens, youth, women, cultural, cooperative, sports, and other organizations that endorse the program of the struggle for peace, fight against the threat of a new war.

Pravda emphatically pointed out: National and local organizations of peace advocates cannot limit their activities to collecting signatures. They must strive to have all those who have already signed participate in the active and practical struggle for peace. Peace advocates should consider it their duty to consolidate the achievements already made, expand the scale of the peace movement, and make it more organized. Special attention must be paid to explanatory work among peasants and the middle strata of urban residents. An important task for peace advocates is to involve political figures and social celebrities, prominent scientists, writers, artists, and participants in cultural, scientific, cooperative, and other organizations in the active struggle for peace.

Pravda concluded by stating: The peace movement is currently rising to a higher stage. Expanding the mass base of the peace movement and involving the broadest strata of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals in the active struggle against the imperialist warmongers is the most crucial task at present.

　　扩大和平运动的群众基础
    挫败美国战贩的罪恶计划
    真理报论爱好和平者的战斗任务
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于九日以《扩大为和平而斗争的阵线》为题发表社论称：为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动所具有的历史意义，在于它将最广大的人民群众团结在和平旗帜的周围。现在，这个运动已在世界各国展开，并且已经扩展到以前尚未参加保卫和平斗争的居民层中间了。
    真理报指出：最近数周的事件证明，美国统治集团已由准备侵略进而采取直接的侵略行动。摆在全体爱好和平的人民面前的首要战斗任务，就是不惜支付任何代价，挫败美国战争贩子的罪恶计划。这要求和平拥护者更进一步地扩大和平运动的群众基础，务使地球上一切正直的人，一切公民、青年、妇女、文化、合作社、体育及其他拥护争取和平斗争之纲领的组织，都为反对新战争的威胁而斗争。
    真理报着重指出：和平拥护者的全国组织与地方组织，不能将他们的活动只限于征集签名。他们必须努力使一切已经签名的人参加争取和平的积极的实际斗争。和平拥护者应认为巩固已经取得的成就，扩大和平运动的规模，并使之更有组织性，是他们的职责。在农民中与城市居民的中间阶层中的讲解工作，须予以特别注意。和平拥护者的重要任务是使政治人物与社会名流，卓越的科学家、作家、艺术工作者，文化、科学、合作社及其他组织的参加者参加争取和平的积极斗争。
    真理报在结语中指出：和平运动目前正在升长到更高的阶段。扩大和平运动的群众基础，使工人阶级、农民及知识分子的最广大阶层参加反对帝国主义战争贩子的积极斗争，这就是目前至关重要的任务。
