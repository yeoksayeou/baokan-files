Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 10th: The production competition movement in Tianjin's public factories has expanded on a larger scale in June. The number of participating units increased from 71 in May to 105. The competition movement has had a positive effect on improving production and has become an important factor for most factories that have participated in the competition to complete or exceed their June production plans. Taking several major industrial products as examples, the output of steel ingots, electrodes, and wire rods in Tianjin Steel Plant in June exceeded the plan by 18% to 19% respectively. Among them, the output of steel ingots exceeded the previous highest monthly output of the plant by 26%. The output of yarn and cloth from the six factories under the China Textile Company, as of the 29th of last month, had exceeded the full-month plan by about 5.7% to 6%. Other factories such as the Electrical Equipment Factory, the Railway Factory, and the factories under the Municipal Industrial Bureau have also completed their scheduled plans; the most exceeding the plan by one to two times.

A significant feature of the production competition movement in Tianjin's public factories in June is that most factories paid attention to improving quality. For example, China Textile Company revised the competition scoring method, increased the weight of quality in the scoring; and strengthened technical guidance to various factories through inspection teams and holding special technical seminars. Units such as the Rubber Accessories Factory, the Bicycle Factory, and various factories of the China Textile Company all made improving quality the main goal of the competition. Therefore, the product quality of most factories has been considerably improved. The prime cloth produced by the Third and Fifth Factories of the China Textile Company in June has reached 98.99% to 99.22% of the products. The Central Electrical Equipment First Manufacturing Factory has basically eliminated the defective products in the light bulbs it produces. The defective product rate per kiln of the Refractory Materials Factory of the Municipal Industrial Bureau in June has dropped from 16.52% in May to 3.89% in June.

The establishment of various systems plays an important role in improving and ensuring product quality. The factories of China Textile Company and most factories under the Municipal Industrial Bureau have established and improved the inspection and inspection record system; some units have also begun to promote inter-workshop or inter-departmental liaison contracts, shift handover systems, responsibility systems, and contracted machine systems.

Although the production competition in June has been widely carried out, except for larger factories where development is relatively normal and thus achievements are more prominent, the competition in some factories has not yet formed a mass movement. The management committees of general factories have not fully played their role in the competition. In the organizational leadership of the city-wide production competition, there are still problems of dispersed forces and inconsistent steps in June. These problems are currently being addressed by relevant parties.

　　天津市公营工厂百余单位展开竞赛
    大部工厂注意了改进质量
    【新华社天津十日电】六月份天津市公营工厂的生产竞赛运动，已在更广泛的规模上展开。进行竞赛的单位，由五月份的七十一个增加到一百零五个。竞赛运动对改进生产起了积极的效果，成为大部分开展竞赛的工厂完成或超过了六月份生产计划的一个重要因素。以若干主要工业产品为例，天津钢厂六月份钢锭、电极、盘条的产量分别超过计划百分之十八到十九。其中钢锭产量超过以往该厂最高月产量百分之二十六。中纺公司所属六个厂的纱、布产量，至上月二十九日止，已超过全月计划百分之五点七到百分之六左右。及他如电工器材厂、铁路工厂、市工业局所属工厂，亦都完成了预定计划；最多的超过计划达一倍到两倍。
    六月份天津市公营工厂生产竞赛运动的显著特点是：大部工厂注意了质量的改进。如中纺公司修正了竞赛评分办法，增加了质量在评分中的比重；并通过考查组，召开专门技术座谈会等方式，加强了对各厂的技术指导。橡胶配件厂、自行车厂、中纺各厂等单位，都将改进质量作为竞赛的主要目标。因此，大部工厂的产品质量都有相当提高。中纺公司三、五两厂六月份所产正布，已达到产品的百分之九十八点九九到百分之九十九点二二。中央电工器材第一制造厂已基本上消灭了所制灯泡中的次品。市工业局耐火器材厂六月份每窑废品已由五月份的百分之一六·五二降到六月份的百分之三·八九。
    对提高与保证产品质量起重要作用的是各种制度的建立。中纺各厂和市工业局所属大部工厂，都建立和健全了检验与检查记录制度；部分单位并开始推行车间或部门间的联系合同、交班制、负责制和包乘制等。
    六月份的生产竞赛虽已广泛开展，但除较大工厂发展比较正常因而成绩较为突出外，有些工厂的竞赛还没有形成群众性的运动。一般工厂管委会在竞赛中还没有充分发挥作用。而在全市生产竞赛的组织领导上，六月份仍存在着力量分散、步调不够一致等问题。这些问题现正由有关方面着手解决中。
