　　Unite and Sign
    Chen Qiyuan
    We are patriots, and in order to heal the wounds of war, develop production and construction, and improve the people's lives, we need peace.
    We are also internationalists, and in order to defend the progressive system of New Democracy, Socialism, and even future Communism, and for the future happiness of mankind, we need peace even more.
    Our peace camp has more than one billion people and sufficient strength, so we are not afraid of war, but we need peace even more, as peace is more beneficial to the Chinese and world's people. Only the declining imperialists are afraid of peace and need war.
    We must go deep into every corner of the Chinese countryside, and spread widely to every class and every ethnic group to launch the signing campaign. We must strive for 50 million to 100 million Chinese people to sign their names in the movement to defend world peace.
    We must show the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism that our strength in defending world peace is vast, boundless, powerful, and invincible!
    Only by making U.S. imperialism and its war-mongers tremble in the face of the movement to defend world peace can we eliminate their aggressive fantasies and stop their reckless attempts to launch gambling-style wars using the people as cannon fodder!
    Compatriots who love the motherland, love the people, and love peace, unite and sign!

    我们是爱国主义者，为了医治战争疮伤，发展生产建设，改善人民生活，我们需要和平。
    我们同时是国际主义者，为了保卫新民主主义，社会主义以至未来的共产主义的进步制度，为了世界人类前途幸福，我们更需要和平。
    我们和平阵营有十万万以上的人民，有足够力量，是不会害怕战争的，但我们更需要和平，和平对于中国以至世界人民是更有利的。只有没落的帝国主义才害怕和平，需要战争。
    我们要深入到中国农村中每一角落，要广泛到每一阶层每一民族去发动签名，我们要争取五千万至一万万中国人民在保卫世界和平运动中签上他们的名字。
    我们要在美帝为首的侵略集团面前表示我们的保卫世界和平力量是广大无边的，威力无比的，不可战胜的！
    只有让美帝国主义及其战争贩子们在保卫世界和平运动面前发抖，才能消灭他们的侵略幻想，才能停止他们以人民作炮灰发动赌博式的战争的狂妄企图！
    爱祖国、爱人民、爱和平的同胞，一致起来签名！
