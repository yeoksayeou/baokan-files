Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th. Huangniwan Village in Linxia County, Gansu Province, has strengthened the close relationship between the Hui and Han people by correctly implementing ethnic policies, organizing a Hui-Han National Unity Committee, and establishing a unity and mutual aid pact. This has resolved the ethnic disputes that have existed in the village for many years, as well as the riots caused by shortcomings in the work after liberation. This is an example for resolving ethnic disputes in areas where various ethnic groups live together in the Northwest.

Huangniwan Village is inhabited by both Hui and Han ethnic groups. In the past, the reactionary rule of bandit Ma caused deep divisions and animosity between the Hui and Han people. After liberation, due to the rapid development of the situation, there was a shortage of working cadres, and policies were not promoted in a timely manner. Some cadres mechanically applied the working methods of Han areas, such as organizing militia too early, and failing to carefully examine the composition of the militia when organizing them, which allowed bad elements to infiltrate and take the opportunity to seek revenge. Bandits and special agents took advantage of these errors and shortcomings in the work to spread rumors and incite disunity between the Hui and Han people, and colluded with habitual bandits to coerce some of the masses into carrying out riots. The Hui and Han people fled their homes one after another, suffered huge losses to their property, and caused a severe famine.

To this end, the Linxia Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formed a work team in November of last year to work in the village. The work team first approached the Hui and Han people separately, expressed sympathy to the affected masses, publicized ethnic policies, and reviewed the shortcomings in the work; and based on the opinions of the masses, selected people with prestige among the Hui and Han ethnic groups to form a unity committee through a mass meeting, in proportion to the population of each ethnic group. After its establishment, the committee held consultations, established a unity and mutual aid pact, and actively mobilized the masses who had fled to return to the village for production. At the call of the unity committee, many Hui people drove carts to pick up Han people who had fled back to the village, and the Han people gave tea and other items to the Hui people. They talked to each other and eliminated the mutual divisions. Based on the principle of mutual respect and mutual concession, the Hui and Han ethnic groups in the village satisfactorily resolved the various disputes that had existed in the past. The government also provided relief grain loans to help the Hui and Han people solve their production difficulties, which generally increased the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The sowing and summer hoeing of all the village's arable land were completed in a timely manner. Some Hui and Han people have also voluntarily organized to engage in production such as cutting firewood and burning charcoal to overcome the famine.

On the basis of the unity and mutual assistance between the Hui and Han people in the village, the work team further assisted the local people in establishing village political power, peasant associations, and organizing militia. At present, the farmers in the village have generally joined the farmers' association, with more than 340 members. At the same time, the village has established a militia organization of Hui and Han people in proportion to the population of each ethnic group, which has basically eliminated the banditry in the area.

　　加强民族团结的一个范例
    甘肃临夏县黄泥湾村正确执行民族政策
    组织民族团结委员会加强回汉人民关系
    【新华社西安二十日电】甘肃省临夏县黄泥湾村，由于正确地执行了民族政策，组织回、汉民族团结委员会，订立团结互助条约，使该村存在了多年的民族纠纷和因解放后工作中的缺点而酿成的骚乱事件得到解决，加强了回、汉人民的亲密关系，这是西北各民族杂居地区解决民族纠纷的一个范例。
    黄泥湾村系回、汉民族杂居地，过去马匪的反动统治，造成回、汉人民相互间极深的隔阂与仇视。解放后，由于局面的迅速发展，工作干部缺少，未能及时进行政策宣传，部分干部并机械地搬用汉人地区的工作方法，如过早地组织民兵，在组织民兵时又不注意考查民兵的成份，致使坏分子混入，乘机寻仇报复，乱收枪支。土匪、特务就利用这些工作中的错误和缺点，大肆造谣，挑拨回、汉人民的团结，并勾结惯匪，胁迫部分群众，进行骚乱。回、汉人民纷纷弃家逃难，财产遭受巨大损失，并造成严重灾荒。
    为此，中共临夏地委于去年十一月组成工作组，赴该村进行工作。工作组首先分头接近回、汉人民，慰问受害群众，宣传民族政策，检讨工作中的缺点；并根据群众意见，按各民族人口的比例，通过群众大会，选出在回、汉民族中有威望的人士组成团结委员会。该会成立后，即进行协商，订立了团结互助条约，并积极动员在外避难的群众回村生产。在团结委员会的号召下，许多回民赶着车去接逃难的汉民回村，汉民并赠送茶叶等物给回民，相互交谈，消除了互相间的隔阂。在互尊互让的原则下，该村回、汉民族圆满地解决了前所存在的各种纠纷。政府并贷放救济粮，协助回、汉人民解决生产上的困难，因而群众的生产情绪普遍提高。全村可耕土地及时完成了播种和夏锄。若干回、汉人民并自动组织起来，从事砍柴、烧炭等生产，战胜了灾荒。
    在该村回、汉人民团结互助的基础上，工作组乃进一步协助当地人民建立了村政权、农民协会和组织民兵等工作。现该村农民已普遍加入农会，有会员三百四十余人。同时，该村已以各族人口比例，建立了回、汉人民的民兵组织，基本上肃清了该地的匪患。
