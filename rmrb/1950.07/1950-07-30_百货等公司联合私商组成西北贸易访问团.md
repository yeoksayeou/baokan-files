[Beijing News Service] State-owned trade companies, including the Beijing Department Store Company and four other branches, along with private merchants from several industries, under the leadership of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, have organized a "Beijing Northwest Trade Delegation" to visit the Northwest. The purpose of the delegation's visit to the Northwest is to understand the production and sales of Northwest commodities and establish normal trade relations. They are also carrying a set of samples, preparing to exchange some goods, opening up a path for Beijing's commodities to face the Northwest and the vast rural areas in the future, and solving the problem of directly purchasing raw materials and local products from the production areas.

In addition to representatives from the Municipal Bureau of Commerce and the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the delegation includes representatives from the four branches of the state-owned trade companies – Department Store, Trust, Cotton Yarn and Fabric, and Fur – and representatives from several industries of private merchants, such as beef and mutton, department stores, cloth, grain stores, and pork, totaling approximately forty people.
