Implementing the Policy of Considering Both Public and Private Interests and Labor-Capital Benefit
    Yaohua Glass Company Increases Production
    Last Year's Surplus Over Two Million Converted Units
    [This report from our Tianjin correspondent] Due to the correct implementation of the policy of considering both public and private interests and labor-capital benefit, and relying on the worker masses to appropriately reform the old irrational system, the Tianjin Yaohua Glass Company, a joint public-private enterprise, had a surplus of approximately 2,180,000+ converted units last year. This year, the production of the Qinhuangdao factory continues to improve.

    In this company, public shares account for 55%; the remaining 45% are private shares. The company has two glass factories, one in Shanghai and one in Qinhuangdao. The Shanghai factory is newly built and was only completed by the end of last year; it has not yet started operation. The Qinhuangdao factory officially started production in March last year.

    Since the Qinhuangdao factory started operation, the monthly output has consistently exceeded 50,000 cases, more than double the amount before liberation. In the "July 1st" emulation campaign, the factory completed its production target for the first half of the year seventeen days ahead of schedule. The cutting rate increased from the average of 79.5% for the fourteen months before May of this year to the current 83.3%; the case-making department reached a record high of 95 cases per worker; the brick-making department increased from 170 bricks per person per day to over 500 bricks; the sand room also ensures that the alkali content of raw materials does not exceed 0.4%, and due to careful crushing, sieving, and blending, it is easy to melt, which has improved the quality of the glass to an unprecedented level. The factory's employees have generally paid attention to conservation. After research by technicians, sandstone was used instead of sea sand, which can reduce the price by more than 170 catties of millet per ton; the amount of coal used per case of glass was reduced from 100 kg to 60 kg, and the electricity consumption was reduced from 5 kWh to 3.3 kWh. The annual savings in raw material consumption totaled over 12 million catties of millet. This greatly reduced costs.

    In terms of reforming the old irrational system, the most significant is the improvement of the reward system. In the past, the factory had a large number of bonus items, and the amount was small, which lost the meaning of the bonus. After liberation, the method of democratic evaluation and election of model workers was adopted, and high bonuses were given to the selected special-grade employees and labor models, which greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the employees. In addition, unreasonable labor organization was improved, and the surplus workers in various departments were organized into a construction brigade to participate in the factory's construction projects. In order to further reduce costs and expand sales, the company is promoting various quota standards.

    Based on the principle of considering both public and private interests and labor-capital benefit, in the last fiscal year's surplus of Yaohua Company, in addition to paying a portion of dividends and taxes, 25%, or 1 billion yuan, of the balance was used as a public accumulation fund, 15%, or 600 million yuan, was used as an employee welfare fund, and 60%, or 2.4 billion yuan, was used as dividends, distributed to the public and private shareholders.

### 贯彻公私兼顾劳资两利政策  耀华玻璃公司生产提高  去年盈余二百余万折实单位

　　贯彻公私兼顾劳资两利政策
    耀华玻璃公司生产提高
    去年盈余二百余万折实单位
    【本报天津讯】公私合营的天津耀华玻璃公司，由于正确的执行了公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策，依靠工人群众适当的改革了旧有不合理的制度，去年一年盈余约二百一十八万多折实单位。今年秦皇岛工厂的生产仍在继续提高。
    该公司公股占百分之五十五；其余百分之四十五为私股。公司计有上海和秦皇岛两个玻璃工厂。上海为新建厂，至去年年底始竣工，迄今尚未开工；秦皇岛厂于去年三月正式开工生产。
    秦皇岛工厂自开工以来，每月生产量经常超过五万箱，较解放以前增加一倍多。在迎接“七一”竞赛中，该厂提前十七天完成了半年生产任务。切出率由今年五月以前十四个月的平均数百分之七十九点五增高到现在的百分之八十三点三；造箱部达到每工九十五箱的最高纪录；造砖部由每人每天一百七十块增至五百多块；沙子房亦保证原料的含碱量不超过百分之○点四，且因粉碎过筛，细心负责，调合均匀，易于熔化，使玻璃品质空前提高。该厂职工普遍注意了节约，经技术人员研究改用砂岩代替海砂，每吨价格可减低一百七十余斤小米；每箱玻璃用煤量由一百公斤减为六十公斤，用电由五度减少为三点三度。全年在原料消耗方面，节约共合一千二百多万斤小米。这就大大降低了成本。
    在改革旧有不合理制度方面，最显著的是改进了奖励制度。过去该厂奖金名目繁多，数额微小，失去奖金的意义。解放后，采用了民主评议选举模范的办法，对当选的特等职工和劳动模范每人给予高额奖励，因而大大启发了职工的积极性。此外并改进了不合理的劳动组织，将各部门编余工人组成建设大队，参加厂内建设工程。为进一步降低成本，扩大销路，该公司正在推行各种定额标准。
    根据公私兼顾、劳资两利的原则，耀华公司在上年度的盈余中，除付一部分股息及税款外，以余额的百分之二十五计十亿元做为公积金，百分之十五计六亿元做为职工福利基金，百分之六十计二十四亿元做为股利，分配给各公私股东。
