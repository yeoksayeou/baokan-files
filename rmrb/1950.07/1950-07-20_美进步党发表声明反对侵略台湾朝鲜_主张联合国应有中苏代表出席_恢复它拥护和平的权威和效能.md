Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 18th: The National Committee of the Progressive Party held a meeting to discuss the international situation related to the Korean incident and issued a statement.

Party Secretary Bower told reporters that nearly 100 members of the National Committee, representing 17 state branches, attended the meeting. With the exception of two, all members of the National Committee voted in favor of the statement previously drafted by the Executive Committee. Bower said, "Since the beginning of the Korean War, the Progressive Party's Executive Committee has held several meetings to resolve differences of opinion, especially between Wallace and other members of the Executive Committee. Earlier this week, we believed we had reached a consensus, but Wallace requested time to consider it before the Progressive Party's statement was published." Bower said that the next day, Wallace informed the Executive Committee that unless the Committee deleted the words mentioning the atomic bomb and Taiwan from the statement and replaced the suggestion of immediately allowing China to join the United Nations with the suggestion that the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean War was "Russia's active return to the constructive work of the United Nations," he would not endorse the statement.

Wallace issued a separate statement supporting the American war against the Korean people.

The original text of the Progressive Party National Committee's statement is as follows:

"The Korean War is a product of the Cold War. Every day the Korean War continues, our soldiers sacrifice their lives, and the Korean people are massacred. Every day the Korean War continues, the danger of the conflict escalating into a Third World War increases. The real war is costing us: our children are being drafted, the freedoms of the American people are being further curtailed, and labor rights are being further restricted. The real war will increase military budgets by tens of billions of dollars."

　　China's experience proves: Foreign armed intervention cannot stop the Asian people's liberation movement

After pointing out the existence of differences within the Progressive Party, the statement declared:

"We unanimously believe that the continuation of the war is not in the interest of the American people and is not in the interest of world peace. Therefore, the solution to the Asian crisis must be based on a feasible proposal for an immediate ceasefire.

"This solution must also be based on the recognition of a second fundamental fact. The entire Korean people universally demand to establish for themselves a unified and independent government free from any foreign interference, thereby exercising their inviolable right to self-determination. The Syngman Rhee regime cannot meet this demand. The opinion of every qualified observer who visited Korea in 1946 proves that the Syngman Rhee government is a completely undemocratic government, unsupported by the South Korean people; its continued rule depends only on the forceful suppression of all dissenters. The Syngman Rhee government has been rejected by the South Korean people in the 1950 elections; at that time, the South Korean people, in the face of the terror of a police state, elected a majority faction opposed to the Syngman Rhee regime and in favor of unification with North Korea into the South Korean parliament. China's experience conclusively shows that foreign intervention and foreign weapons, while making national liberation movements more difficult and causing more bloodshed, cannot stop the irresistible force of the liberation movement sweeping the Asian continent. A peaceful and constructive method of resolving the Korean crisis that conforms to this principle can only be achieved through the United Nations; the people of the world have hoped that the United Nations will become the most reliable defender of peace and the defender of the equal rights and self-determination of all nations; the United Nations can still offer the world the best hope for peace today.

　　The UN and the Security Council cannot fulfill the lofty goals of the Charter without Chinese representatives attending

"However, as long as the 450 million people who make up the Chinese nation cannot send representatives to the United Nations and the Security Council, the United Nations cannot fulfill the lofty purposes of its Charter and serve the people of the world. As long as the Chinese seat is occupied by the remnants of a corrupt, discredited, and defeated regime, what the United Nations says cannot have authority, nor can it act effectively; because this regime has been rejected by the vast majority of the Chinese people, they can only act as puppets in Taiwan with the protection of the American fleet that is trying to prevent the Chinese government from unifying Taiwan and the mainland. Therefore, the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean crisis must be to restore the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations. And to achieve this goal, it is necessary to restore the principles of the United Nations Charter by giving the People's Republic of China a seat, as urged by Lai Yi and Prime Minister Nehru.

"Therefore, the American people should demand that our government take immediate action to eliminate this obstacle to peace. As long as the United Nations allows the Chinese government to join and allows the Soviet Union to return to the Security Council, thereby restoring its effectiveness, the Security Council can take the following measures to maintain peace: First, issue appropriate orders and take measures to end the war in Korea and prepare for the immediate establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic government for all of Korea. Second, demand that President Truman revoke his unilateral directive to the American fleet to defend Taiwan, which is an intervention in China's civil war and a blatant violation of the Cairo Agreement regarding "all territories that Japan stole from the Chinese, such as the Northeast, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, should be returned to the Republic of China," the obligations confirmed by the Potsdam Agreement, the terms of Japan's surrender, and the obligations stated by Truman in his statement on January 5, 1950. Third, through appropriate United Nations agencies, establish a United Nations Construction and Development Fund to provide economic assistance and technical assistance to Asian countries on a non-political basis, in order to rapidly develop their industry, agriculture, and facilitate their desire for self-determination and independence.

　　The voice of the people of the world can prevent the American imperialists from interfering in Korea and avoid atomic war

"In the United States, there have been calls for dropping the atomic bomb on Korea. We denounce this inhuman proposal and demand that our government declare that it will not use the atomic bomb. We are convinced in making these suggestions that although peace is currently under serious threat, world war is not inevitable, and the voice of peace-loving people in all countries of the world can force their governments to accept these measures to end the killing in Korea and avoid the devastation of atomic war. We present these suggestions as a peace program around which all Americans and all good people in the world, regardless of how divergent their opinions may be on other issues, can unite.

"As long as the people can make their voices heard, then we still have a chance to save world peace."

### 美进步党发表声明反对侵略台湾朝鲜  主张联合国应有中苏代表出席  恢复它拥护和平的权威和效能

　　美进步党发表声明反对侵略台湾朝鲜
    主张联合国应有中苏代表出席
    恢复它拥护和平的权威和效能
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：进步党全国委员会举行会议，讨论了与朝鲜事件有关的国际形势问题；并发表声明。
    进步党书记鲍尔温告记者称：代表十七个州分会的近百名全国委员会委员出席了会议。除两人之外，全国委员会所有委员都投票赞成执行委员会前此起草的声明。鲍尔温说：“自朝鲜战事开始以来，进步党执行委员会已举行数次会议，力图解决分歧意见，尤其是华莱士和执委会其他委员之间的分歧，本周初，我们以为已经取得一致，但华莱士请求给他时间，以便在进步党的声明发表前对它加以考虑。”鲍尔温说：第二天，华莱士通知执委会说，除非执委会删去声明中提到原子弹和台湾的字句，并以和平解决朝鲜战争的第一步是“俄国重行积极参加联合国的建设性工作”的建议，来代替立即允许中国加入联合国的建议，否则他将不列名这一声明。
    华莱士发表了赞成美国反对朝鲜人民的战争的单独声明。
    进步党全国委员会的声明原文如下：
    “朝鲜战争是冷战的产物。朝鲜战争继续的每一天，我国兵士都要牺牲生命，朝鲜人民都要遭受屠杀。朝鲜战争继续的每一天，战事爆发成为第三次世界大战的危险性都在增加。真正的战争，正使我们付出代价：我们的子弟被征召入伍，美国人民的自由被进一步剥夺，以及劳工权利受到更大的限制。真正的战争，将使军事预算增加数百亿美元。”
            中国的经验证明：外国武装干涉阻不住亚洲人民解放运动
    该声明于指出进步党党内存在着分歧后，随即宣称：
    “我们一致相信：战事的继续是不符合美国人民的利益的，是不符合世界和平的利益的。因此，亚洲危机的解决方案，必须以立即停战的可行的建议为基础。
    “这种解决方案，又必须以承认第二个基本事实为基础。全体朝鲜人民普遍要求为他们自己建立不受任何外国干涉的、统一的、独立的政府，从而行使他们的不可侵犯的自决权。李承晚政权不能满足这一要求。一九四六年访问过朝鲜的每一位有资格的观察家的意见都证明，李承晚政府是一个完全不民主的政府，不受南朝鲜人民的支持；它的继续当权，只是靠了对于一切异己者的强力压制。李承晚政府已在一九五○年的选举中遭到南朝鲜人民的拒斥；当时，南朝鲜人民在警察国家的恐怖面前，把反对李承晚政权而赞成与北朝鲜统一的多数派，选入南朝鲜议会。中国的经验确凿地表明：外国的干涉与外国的武器，固然能使民族解放运动更为艰难，流更多的血，但却阻挡不住横扫亚洲大陆的解放运动的无可抵抗的力量。符合这种原则的，解决朝鲜危机的和平的建设性的方法，只有通过联合国才能获得；世界人民已经希望联合国成为和平的最可靠的捍卫者与各国人民的平等权利及自决权的保卫者；联合国今日仍然可以给世界提供最好的和平希望。
            联合国及安理会如无中国代表出席就不能履行宪章高尚目的
    “但是，只要组成中国民族的四亿五千万人民不能派代表出席联合国及安理会，联合国就不能履行它的宪章的高尚目的及为世界人民服务。只要中国席位被一个腐败的、名誉扫地的、被击败的政权的残余分子占据着，联合国所说的话就不能有权威，它也就不能有效地行动；因为这个政权已被绝大多数中国人民所摈弃，他们只是靠了力图阻止中国政府把台湾和大陆统一起来的美国舰队的庇护，才能在台湾充当傀儡。所以，和平解决朝鲜危机的第一步，必须是恢复联合国的权威和效能。而要达到这个目的，必须依照赖伊和尼赫鲁总理所敦促的，给中华人民共和国以席位，从而恢复联合国宪章的原则。
    “因此，美国人民应该要求我国政府立即采取行动，消除这个和平的障碍。只要联合国准许中国政府加入，使苏联返回安理会从而恢复其效能，则安理会就能够采取下列措施，维护和平：第一，发布适当的命令，采取办法以终止朝鲜的战争，并准备立即成立全朝鲜的统一、独立、民主的政府。第二，要求杜鲁门总统撤销其命令美国舰队保卫台湾的片面指令，这一指令乃是对中国内战的干涉，公然违犯：关于“日本窃自中国人的一切领土，诸如东北、台湾与澎湖列岛，应交还中华民国”的开罗协定，波茨坦协定所确认的义务、日本投降的条款及杜鲁门一九五○年一月五日在其声明中所表明的义务。第三、通过适当的联合国机构，设立联合国建设与发展基金，在非政治的基础上，给亚洲各国以经济援助及技术协助，以迅速发展它们的工业、农业，并便利它们要求自决与独立的愿望的和平实现。
            全世界人民呼声，能阻止美帝干涉朝鲜和避免原子战争
    “在美国，已有人叫嚣要求在朝鲜投掷原子弹。我们指斥这种不人道的建议，并要求我们政府宣布不使用原子弹。我们在提出这些建议时确信：尽管目前和平受到严重威胁，世界战争仍不是不可避免的，世界各国爱好和平的人民的呼声，能够迫使他们的政府接受这些措施，以终止在朝鲜的杀戮并避免原子战争的毁灭。我们提出这些建议作为一个和平纲领，一切美国人和全世界善良的人们，不论他们对其他问题的意见如何分歧，都可以在这一纲领周围团结起来。
    “只要人民能够使他们的呼声为人听到，那末，我们仍有机会拯救世界和平。”
