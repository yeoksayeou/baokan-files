More Good Translated Books Needed!
    Wang Zixiang
    The importance of translation work, especially the translation of Russian books, is well known today, and I don't want to say much more about it.
    However, has our past translation and publication of Russian books been done well? It can be said with certainty that there have been great achievements, but it must also be said that there are still some serious shortcomings.
    I want to talk about it from two aspects:
    First, it belongs to the translators. The past lack of serious work attitude of some translators has long been criticized by readers. However, in those years, under the rule of the reactionaries, it was already very difficult to dare to boldly translate progressive Russian books, and even if the quality was poor, it could still be forgiven by the readers. However, under today's conditions, we cannot but demand more from the translators.
    In the past, the shoddy translation work was due to two reasons: one was that the translator was limited by his ability and could only do what he could. We can forgive these translators, and we hope that they will strive for progress.
    The other is that the language level was originally good, but due to the desire to earn more royalties, they deliberately produced shoddy work. There are indeed such translators. These translators should be blamed.
    Now, whether for the former or the latter, we have a common requirement, which is to take the translation work seriously and earnestly, and truly be responsible to the people.
    For example, until now, there are still many badly translated works (such as some of Gorky's works) circulating in the market. The translators clearly know that they are not good, but they still allow them to circulate in order to貪圖some royalties.
    For example, there is now a book by Farberov, "On the State Law of People's Democratic Countries," the first half of which was translated by Mr. He Qian, entitled "On People's Democratic Countries"; the second half was also translated by Mr. He Qian, but with the addition of Mr. Liu Jun and Mr. Ji Zhuang, entitled: "Introduction to New Democratic Countries." Whether it is the first half or the second half, just flipping through it will reveal some errors. For example, in the translation of "On People's Democratic Countries," a paragraph is missing from page 103, line 3 (original page 85, lines 22 to 26); a paragraph is missing from page 108, line 13 (original page 89, lines 22 to 28); a paragraph is missing from page 114, line 11 (original page 93, lines 23 to 27). Only ten pages before and after, three omissions. In addition, "consolidating the universal legal and moral labor obligations" is translated into "stipulating labor obligations" (translation page 52, line 3, original page 49, line 16), and "it realizes the state's leadership over society" is translated into "it leads the national society" (translation page 55, line 10, original page 52, line 19). More strangely, "England" is translated into "Italy" (translation page 106, line 9, original page 88, line 1).
    As for "Introduction to New Democratic Countries," "This provision of the constitution is directly aimed at the exploiters" is translated into "This provision of the constitution is aimed at opposing the exploiters" (translation page 156, line 3, original page 291, line 1). At first glance, it makes people feel that the constitution of the new democratic country is protecting the exploiters. Also, "The Germans wanted to eliminate the national statehood of Poland and turn the Polish nation, which contributed Copernicus, Mickiewicz, Chopin, Kosciuszko, Dombrovsky, and Dzerzhinsky to the world, into slaves" is translated into "Germany wanted to eliminate the state of the Polish nation and turn the Polish people into obedient slaves of Goebbels, Mickiewicz, Schaub, Kopf, and Dezler" (translation page 6, line 7, original page 102, last line); This immediately turned many famous progressive scientists, artists, and military strategists into fascist reactionaries. This kind of mistake has become a political mistake, and it is a typical bad example.
    All of the above are the responsibility of the translators. Translators must correct these irresponsible phenomena to the people. Therefore, I suggest that all old translators should first carefully proofread their old books; secondly, they must not be sloppy with newly translated books. All new translators must clarify the original meaning, and should translate it with "understanding of its meaning" rather than "literal translation." Only in this way can we be worthy of the people, worthy of the original work, and make progress for ourselves. We must oppose any opportunistic translation, because this can only make oneself degenerate, and the readers will not forgive it.
    Secondly, it belongs to the publishers of translated books. Until now, there are still serious speculative phenomena in our private publishing industry, especially for the publication of translated books. For a slightly meaningful book, people rush to find someone to translate it. Therefore, it is still common in today's publishing industry for several versions of a book to appear at the same time. For example, there are five or six translations of Lysenko's "The Situation in Biology," and there are more than three translations of "The End of World Capitalism," "The Conspiracy Against Peace," and "Moscow Character." We are not against re-translation. If a translation is not good, we should encourage publishing a better one. But the phenomenon mentioned above is not due to this reason, and this must be improved.
    The split translation and publication of the aforementioned "On the State Law of People's Democratic Countries" is another kind of speculation. One company (Mass Bookstore) impatiently rushed to publish half of a book before it was completely translated, while another company (Joint Bookstore) quickly rushed to translate the second half and published the other half, leaving readers confused.
    The above-mentioned chaos and speculative phenomena in the publishing industry will naturally also affect translators, encourage shoddy translation, and in fact cause serious waste in economy and manpower, causing extreme irresponsibility to readers. Therefore, we must loudly appeal to some publishers: Please stop rushing to translate and publish indiscriminately!
    In a word, there are serious phenomena as mentioned above in our translation and publishing circles. If this phenomenon is not overcome, it will harm readers for a long time. Therefore, we must eliminate this phenomenon, and translators and publishers should work together to produce some good translated books. Only in this way can it help the economic and cultural construction of the People's Republic of China, and help the progress of the Chinese people's thinking.

### 要多出几本好的翻译书！

　　要多出几本好的翻译书！
    王者香
    翻译工作，特别是俄文书籍翻译工作的重要性，今天已尽人皆知，我不想多说了。
    但是，过去我们的俄文书籍翻译工作和出版工作是否作好了呢？可以肯定地说，是有很大成绩的，然而也不能不说还存在有若干严重缺点。
    我想从两方面来讲：
    首先，是属于翻译工作者的。过去的若干翻译工作者工作态度不够认真，久已为读者所诟病了。不过在当年因受反动派统治，敢于大胆翻译进步俄文书籍已经很不容易，即使质量差些，也还可以得到读者的原谅。然而处在今天的条件之下，却不能不向译者要求高一些了。
    过去翻译工作的粗制滥造，不外两种原因：一种是译者受能力所限，仅能作到已有的程度。对这种译者我们是可以原谅的，我们希望他们努力求进步。
    另一种是语文程度本来还好，然而由于要多拿些稿费，因而故意粗制滥造的。这种翻译者的确也是有的。这一种译者是应当受责备的。
    现在，不论对于前一种或者后一种，我们有一个共同的要求，就是把翻译工作态度严肃和认真起来，真正作到对人民负责。
    譬如说，直到现在还有许多翻译得很坏的作品（如高尔基的若干作品）在市面流行，译者明明知道是不好的，只是为了贪图一些版税而仍任其流行。
    又譬如说，现在有一本法尔别洛夫的《论人民民主国国家法》，上半部是由何倩先生翻译的，题为《论人民民主国家》；下半部也是由何倩先生，不过又加上了刘钧和季庄二位先生合译的，题为：《新民主国家介绍》。不论上半部或下半部，只要随手一翻就会发现若干错误。如《论人民民主国家》译文第一○三页第三行（原文八五页二二行至二六行）起脱落了一段；第一○八页第一三行（原文八九页二二行至二八行）起脱落一段；第一一四页第一一行（原文九三页二三行至二七行）起脱落一段。前后不过十页，脱落三处之多。另外把“巩固着普遍的法律和道德上的劳动义务”译成“规定劳动的义务”（译文第五二页第三行，原文第四九页第一六行），把“它实现着国家对社会的领导”译成“它领导着国家社会”（译文第五五页第一○行，原文第五二页第一九行）。更奇怪的是把“英国”译成了“意大利”（译文第一○六页第九行，原文第八八页第一行）。
    如《新民主国家介绍》，把“宪法的这个规定是直接地针对着剥削分子的”译成“宪法的这个规定是针对着反对剥削分子们的”（译文第一五六页第三行，原文第二九一页第一行）。这句话猛一看，令人觉得新民主主义国家的宪法竟是保护剥削分子的了。又把“德国人想要消灭波兰的民族国家性，而把那对世界贡献了哥白尼、米兹吉维奇、萧邦、科斯杜施柯、顿布罗夫斯基、捷尔任斯基的波兰民族变为奴隶”译成“德国想要消灭波兰民族的国家，把波兰人民变为戈贝尔、米兹格维赤、绍贝恩、郭勃劳夫、德兹勒日的顺从的奴隶”（译文第六页第七行，原文第一○二页末行）；这一下子把许多有名的进步的科学家艺术家军事家都变成法西斯反动派了。这种错误已成了政治性的错误，是典型的坏例子。
    以上这些，都是应由翻译者负责的。翻译者必须改正这些对人民不负责的现象。因此，我建议：凡是老翻译工作者，第一步要把自己旧出的书认真去校对一下；第二步对新译的书一定再不能马虎。凡是新翻译工作者，必须要把原意弄清楚，应当是“心知其义”地翻出来，而不是“望文生义”地翻出来。只有这样才能对得起人民，才能对得起原著，才能对自己有进步。要反对任何投机取巧的翻译，因为这只能使自己堕落，读者是不会饶恕的。
    其次是属于翻译书的出版者的。直到现在为止，在我国的私营出版业中间还存在着严重的投机取巧现象，特别是对于翻译书的出版，一本稍有意义的书，争先恐后地找人抢译。因而一本书同时出现几个版本，在今天的出版界还是很平常的事。如李森科的《生物学现状》有五六种译本，《世界资本主义的末日》，《反和平的阴谋》，《莫斯科性格》等都有三种以上的译本。我们并不反对复译。如果一个译本不好，再出一本好的，我们是应当鼓励的。但上面所说的现象并不是由于这种原因，这就是必须改善的了。
    前面所讲的《论人民民主国国家法》的割裂翻译与出版，是又一种投机现象。一家（群众书店）是把一本书等不及抢译完就出一半，而另一家（联合书店）则赶快又去抢译下半本，又出一半，弄得读者莫明其妙。
    上面这种出版界的混乱与投机现象，自然也要影响翻译工作者，鼓励了翻译者的粗制滥造，事实上就造成经济上人力上的严重浪费，造成了对读者极端不负责任。所以我们要向若干出版家大声疾呼：请你们再不要抢译乱出吧！
    总而言之，在我国的翻译界和出版界是存在着上述严重现象的。如不把这种现象克服，将长期使读者受害。因此我们必须肃清这种现象，由翻译者和出版者共同努力来出一些好的翻译书。只有这样才能有助于中华人民共和国的经济与文化的建设事业，才能有助于中国人民思想的进步。
