　　Shijingshan Power Plant Greets "July 1st"
    Victory in Completing Last Month's Production Task
    Production Competition to Continue in July
    [Report from this newspaper] To welcome "July 1st," the capital's Shijingshan Power Plant signed a collective contract for the entire plant in June. All employees actively engaged in production competitions between workshops, teams, shifts, and individuals to complete and exceed the production plan. Over the course of the month, more than 150 rationalization proposals, technical improvements, and new records were achieved. Coal consumption has been reduced to below 0.8 (the production plan specifies coal consumption of 0.815). The entire plant has achieved significant results in production, but accidents are still frequent, with 24 accidents occurring in the first half of June alone. In the process of the competition, a number of advanced production teams and individuals emerged. The Liu Dezhen team of the Turbine Workshop repair crew completed a month's production plan in half a month. The Liang Fengchang team of the pulverized coal furnace had no responsibility accidents for the entire month, continuously maintaining the most adequate steam pressure for more than ten days. The fineness of pulverized coal reached 80% for bituminous coal (the general fineness in the past was 65%) and 74% for anthracite coal (the general fineness in the past was 60%). The rejection rate of the Foundry Department of the repair shop decreased from 30% (in April) to 5%. Workers Fang Zhengming and Fang Ruiting did not produce a single defective product throughout the month. The workers of this department have challenged the Foundry Department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to a competition, and the Iron and Steel Plant has enthusiastically accepted the challenge. Liu Dezhen found a rupture in the steam pipe of No. 6 generator. After proposing a repair that was carried out, not only was the steam wasting problem of No. 6 generator eliminated, but the circulating water temperature was also reduced, estimated to save more than 240 tons of coal per month. Zhao Rongjiu, a worker in the Electrical Workshop, created a machine to wind coils, increasing work efficiency by twelve times. The problem of pulverized coal leakage from the pulverized coal furnace, which the plant had been unable to solve for several years, has also been basically resolved. Through the efforts of all employees, the plant's June production task has been successfully completed, with a portion even exceeding the target.
    Why have so many achievements been made? First, before launching the competition across the plant, the plant held an awards ceremony and signed a collective contract, which invigorated the work of the entire plant. The Party, government, labor union, and Youth League all concentrated their efforts on completing the production plan. The labor union even mobilized the masses to inspect the implementation of the collective contract and launched criticism and self-criticism. Second, the entire plant established team plans, and the five workshops established contact contracts, strengthening the connection between various departments. Third, the Party assisted the labor union in cultivating model teams, which took the lead in proposing challenges between teams and launching competitions. The general branch shared the work experience of model teams during Party lectures. Fourth, the general branch strengthened propaganda and mobilization work, establishing a propaganda and mobilization work committee, absorbing cultural and educational committee members from the labor union, Youth League, and Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch, and utilizing twelve forms such as cartoons, broadcasts, production charts, and red and black lists. Combining with the central content of the competition, they produced 246 propaganda items in half a month, commending the advanced and criticizing the backward, which played a significant role in production. For example, one cartoon summarized the story of half a month: the Turbine Workshop had no accidents and was marked with a large flag, the Boiler Workshop had more accidents and was shown with bandages, and the Electrical Workshop had the most accidents and was shown using crutches. The workers in the Electrical Workshop and Boiler Workshop, after seeing this cartoon, said, "We don't want to be missing arms and legs anymore."
    This is how the production competition was launched. Now the workers' enthusiasm is growing. In July, the movement to continue production, create new records, and sign a collective contract for the overhaul of No. 17 furnace will continue. Moreover, the plant's foundry workshop and the foundry department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have also launched a competition to reduce the rejection rate.

　　石景山发电厂迎接“七一”
    胜利完成上月生产任务
    七月份将继续开展生产竞赛
    【本报讯】首都石景山发电厂为迎接“七一”，签订六月份全厂集体合同后，全体职工为完成并超过生产计划，场与场，组与组，班与班，个人与个人纷纷展开生产竞赛，全月内合理化建议、改进技术、创造新纪录共达一百五十余件。煤耗已降低至○·八以下（生产计划规定煤耗为○·八一五）。全厂在生产上获得显著成绩，只是事故还多，六月上半月就发生事故二十四次。在竞赛过程中，出现了不少先进的生产小组和个人。汽机场修理班刘德珍小组半个月完成了一个月的生产计划。煤粉炉梁凤昌小组全月未发生责任事故，连续保持十余日供给最足的汽压，煤粉细度，烟煤达到百分之八十（过去一般细度是百分之六十五），硬煤达到百分之七十四（过去一般细度是百分之六十）。修理场铸工部废品率由百分之三十（四月份）降低至百分之五，工人房正明、房瑞亭全月未出一件废品，该部工人已向石景山钢铁厂铸工部提出竞赛挑战，钢铁厂热烈应战。刘德珍检查出六号机导汽管破裂，经提出建议修好后，不仅消除了六号机费汽的毛病，且可减低循环水温，估计每月可省二百四十多吨煤。电气场工人赵荣久创造用机器缠线圈，工作效率提高十二倍。该厂几年一直不能解决的煤粉炉跑煤粉问题，也已经基本解决。该厂六月份生产任务经全厂职工的努力，已胜利完成，并有一部分超额完成。
    为什么获得这么多的成绩呢？第一、在全厂开展竞赛以前，该厂已举行过发奖大会，并签订了集体合同，使全厂的工作紧张起来。党、政、工、团都集中力量来完成生产计划。工会并发动群众来检查集体合同的执行情况，展开了批评与自我批评。第二、全厂订立了小组计划，五个场订立了联系合同。加强了各部门的联系。第三、党协助工会培养了典型小组，并由它们带头，提出组与组的挑战，展开竞赛。总支在上党课时交流了典型小组的工作经验。第四、总支加强了宣传鼓动工作，成立了宣传鼓动工作委员会，吸收工会、团、中苏友协支会等文教委员，运用漫画、广播、生产图表、红黑榜等十二种形式，结合竞赛的中心内容，半个月内制成宣传品二百四十六件，表扬先进，批评落后，在生产上起了很大的作用。例如有一幅漫画，总结半个月的故事，汽机场无一事故，就打着大旗，锅炉场事故较多，就缠着绷带，电气场事故最多，就拄一支拐杖。电气场、锅炉场的工人，看见这幅漫画，都说：“以后别再缺胳膊短腿了。”
    生产竞赛就是这样搞起来的。现在职工们的劲头越来越大。七月份将继续开展生产、创造新纪录运动，并签订大修十七号炉的集体合同。而且该厂铸工场与石景山钢铁厂铸工部也展开减低废品率的竞赛了。
