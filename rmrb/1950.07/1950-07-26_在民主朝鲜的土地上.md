Korean Correspondence No. 2

　　On the Land of Democratic Korea
　　By our newspaper's special correspondent on the Korean front, Li Zhuang

　　We had the opportunity to travel from Pyongyang in western North Korea to Wonsan (in Kangwon Province) on the east coast. This journey, 220 kilometers long, cut across the Korean Peninsula and passed through the famous Taebaek Mountains of Korea. The Taebaek Mountains are exceptionally beautiful, with winding and twisting peaks covered with Masson's pine, larch, evergreen cypress, and a variety of broad-leaved trees. The air is filled with fragrance, a lush green everywhere. Korean People's Self-Defense Forces patrol the mountain roads with spears in hand, protecting the security of the rear. The Taebaek Mountains, like their masters, are strong, beautiful, lovable, and approachable.

　　In northern Korea, the sound of bombing can be heard at any time. American planes, taking off from Japan, cruelly massacre the peaceful people of Korea. However, we saw millions of Koreans on the road, working tenaciously and unyieldingly. Beside a small village fifteen kilometers from Pyongyang, I chatted with a Korean woman selling fruit. At this time, Pyongyang was suffering from the bestial bombing of American planes, with thick smoke rising everywhere. This forty-seven-year-old Korean woman watched quietly, muttering softly. Her husband is a miner with seventeen years of experience, and her two sons are also miners. Her eldest son has been ill for half a year, but with her husband and second son working, their life is still quite comfortable. After the outbreak of the war, her twenty-two-year-old second son, Li Binggui, joined the army, and she started selling fruit to supplement the family income, making life a little more difficult than before the war. I asked her why she sent her son to join the army. She said without hesitation, "He wanted to go! I wanted him to go too! For the independence of the motherland!" The Koreans are most clear about what independence means. She said that in free Korea, she lived in a beautiful worker's dormitory allocated by the state, eating the rice that Koreans love most. But in the era of Japanese occupation, she lived in a thatched house that could not shelter from the wind and rain, eating soybean cakes that the Japanese transported from our Northeast. Now that the Americans have invaded Korea, her four or five years of independent and free life is under serious threat, and she cannot tolerate it. She dedicated her son to the country. One million three hundred thousand people have already joined the army in Korea, which means that one million three hundred thousand such wives and mothers have emerged. This middle-aged woman finally said, "The young people of Korea are all like my son, and they will all resist the Americans." Indeed, Comrade Lin Chunqiu, the Secretary of the Kangwon Province Committee of the Workers' Party of North Korea (equivalent to our provincial party secretary), told me that Kangwon Province has a total population of 1.2 million, and 115,000 have already joined the army, accounting for almost one-tenth of the total population. This kind of power will make the Americans tremble and will eventually defeat them.

　　We specially traveled a section of mountain road to visit a mine. Because it is wartime, I cannot reveal its products or its name. The mine director said that his mine will soon be unable to operate. The workers are all going to the front line. "More than 1,300 workers have left. Where am I going to find people?" He said, "Moreover, we mobilized and dissuaded them, and only a little more than 30 people left." Before the war, the working time in this mine was seven hours underground and eight hours above ground. Now, the workers automatically extend the working time by one hour, with three shifts a day, keeping the machines running at all times. We saw teams of strong workers undergoing military training. After finishing work, they participate in a round of military training before returning home.

　　These brave workers led me to see their newly built auditorium that can accommodate 1,200 people, where movies are shown every Saturday. They said that their food and clothing are allocated by the state (including children and parents over sixty), and each person receives a monthly allowance of 1,300 to 2,000 yuan (each yuan is equivalent to 60+ RMB), and the house is rented by the state. An ordinary house only costs 50 or 60 yuan per month in rent. However, it is said that their main income is still the increased production bonus, which is often several times higher than the allowance each month. Workers and their families receive free medical treatment from the state when they are sick. Workers have twenty days of vacation each year, but now they have automatically canceled their vacation. "We have a good country. Our lives are getting better year by year. The Americans have invaded, and we must defend our country." These workers mentioned the two words "country" in almost every sentence. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is truly a lovable country!

　　Near a hot spring surrounded by mountains and forests, we visited an army hospital. The hospital director, Major Park Joo, is a shrewd and capable middle-aged man. He used to be a regimental commander in the People's Army, but because he had lung disease, he was transferred to the hospital as director. He frowned and said, "We often have desertion here. The wounded are not yet well and want to return to the front line. If you don't allow it, they desert." This hospital can accommodate six or seven hundred wounded soldiers. Since the start of the war, many soldiers have returned to the front line (including the deserters mentioned by the director). The director said: Now everything is for the front line. Before the war, this was a sanatorium, established specifically for soldiers. The water in this hot spring contains a lot of soda and little sulfur. People can drink it to treat gastrointestinal diseases. People's Army commanders and fighters who are physically weak can come here for recuperation with approval. Generally, they recuperate for twenty days. According to statistics, those who recuperate gain an average of two kilograms every ten days. They eat milk, beef, bread, rice, and vegetables. Everything is completely free. The director said: As soon as the artillery sounds, the people who are recuperating immediately go out. The sanatorium has been converted into an army hospital.

　　Going back further, this place was a Japanese hotel. Before "August 15th," only Japanese people and Korean landlords were able to come here for summer vacation and recuperation. Soldiers of the People's Army, most of whom are workers and peasants, were not qualified to live here even for a while. After "August 15th," the Japanese hotel was confiscated and renovated for two years, and converted into a sanatorium. The director said: "In the past, who wouldn't want to stay in such a good place for a few more days? Now, even if their wounds are not fully healed, they clamor to be discharged."

　　Wonsan is the end point of our trip. It is the capital of Kangwon Province, located on the green east coast of Korea. American planes have destroyed half of the city, and many foreign journalists have fully exposed the crimes of American planes bombing peaceful people. We toured the entire urban area. At the bottom of the ruins, I discovered the strong and unyielding will of the Korean people. Many workers and citizens are filling countless bomb craters. They work while discussing the war news published in the *Rodong Sinmun* (the central organ of the Workers' Party of Korea). Workers rescued the factory that was bombed and caught fire amidst the strafing of American planes, and their whole bodies were scorched black. After the enemy planes left, the telephone soldiers immediately repaired the telephone lines. I once talked with a young waitress in the city's cooperative restaurant. She was only a teenager, but she said that she was not afraid of such cruel bombing. "Why is that?" She said, "I am in the state's restaurant, and for the motherland, I have to persist in my work." In an office surrounded by bomb craters, we talked with Comrade Lin Chunqiu, the Secretary of the Kangwon Province Committee. He said, "The willpower of the citizens of Wonsan is amazing. It (referring to the United States) bombs, I join the army, and eliminate it on the ground. More than 3,000 citizens of Wonsan have joined the army. This is the best answer to the brutal Truman and MacArthur."

　　在民主朝鲜的土地上
    本报朝鲜战地特派记者  李庄
    我们得到一个机会，从北朝鲜西部的平壤市，到东海岸上的元山市（属江原道）旅行。这段旅途长二百二十公里，横断朝鲜半岛，穿过朝鲜有名的太白山。太白山异常清秀。峰峦迂回曲折，长满马尾松、落叶松、长青柏和各种各样的阔叶树。遍地清香，一片葱笼。朝鲜人民自卫军手执梭标在山间公路上巡逻，保卫着后方的治安。太白山真象它的主人一样，坚强秀丽，可爱可亲。
    在朝鲜北部，时时可以听到轰炸的声音。从日本起飞的美国飞机，残酷地虐杀朝鲜的和平人民。但是，我们在路上看到千千万万的朝鲜人，他们顽强不屈地工作着。在离平壤十五公里的一个小村边，我和一个卖水果的朝鲜妇女攀谈。这时候，平壤正遭受美国飞机的兽性轰炸，浓烟四起。这位四十七岁的朝鲜妇女，静静地看着，低低地骂着。她丈夫是一位有十七年工龄的矿工，她的两个儿子也是矿工。她的大儿子已经病了半年，但是，有她丈夫和二儿子作工，生活还相当宽裕。战争爆发后，她的二十二岁的二儿子李炳贵参军了，她开始卖水果补助家用，生活较战前困难一些。我问她，为什么要送儿子去参军。她毫不迟疑地说：“他愿意去呀！我也愿意他去呀！为了祖国的独立哟！”独立意味着什么，朝鲜人是最为清楚的。她说，在自由朝鲜，她住着漂亮的，国家拨给她的工人宿舍，吃着朝鲜人最喜欢吃的大米饭。而在日本人侵占时代，她住着不能遮蔽风雨的草房，吃的是日本人从我国东北运来的豆饼。现在，美国人打进朝鲜来了，她这四、五年的独立自由的生活受到严重的威胁，她不能忍耐，就把自己的儿子献给国家，全朝鲜参军者已有一百三十万人，就是说，已经出现了一百三十万这样的妻子和母亲。这位中年妇女最后说：“朝鲜的年青人，都和我儿子一样，他们都会去抵抗美国人。”真的，北朝鲜劳动党江原道道党部委员长（相当我们党的省委书记）林春秋同志告诉我，江原道共有一百二十万人，参军者已有十一万五千人，几占全人口十分之一。这种力量，会使美国人看了发抖，而最后会把它们打败。
    我们特别跋涉一段山路，参观一个矿井。因为是在战时，我不能说出它的产品和它的名字。矿长说，他这个矿井快开不成了。工人都要到前线上去。“一千三百多工人，都走了，我到那里找人去？”他说：“还有，我们动员了，劝阻了，才只走了三十多人。”在战前，这个矿坑下工作时间是七小时，坑上工作时间是八小时。现在，工人自动把工作时间延长了一小时每天三班，闲人不闲机器。我们看见一队队粗壮的工人，正进行军事训练。他们下了工，参加一阵军训以后，才回家去。
    这些勇敢的工人，引我看了他们那新修的能容一千二百人的大礼堂，那里每星期六都放映电影。他们说，他们的食物衣服都由国家配给，（包括子女和六十岁以上的父母）每人每月可得一千三百元到两千元津贴（每元合人民币六十余元），房子由国家租给，普通一所房子，每月只要五、六十元租金。但是，据说他们主要的收入还是增产奖励金，每月常常高出津贴好几倍。工人和他们的家属有病，都由国家免费治疗。工人每年有二十天休假期，现在，他们已经自动把假期取消了。“我们有个好国家。我们的生活一年比一年好。美国人打进来了，我们要保卫我们的国家。”这些工人，他们几乎每句话都提到“国家”这两个字。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，真正是一个可爱的国家！
    在一个山环水绕，林木森森的温泉附近，我们参观了一所陆军医院，医院院长朴柱少校是一个精明强干的中年人，他以前当过人民军的联队长，因为有肺病，调到医院当院长。他皱着眉头说：“我们这里，经常发生逃亡现象。伤员还没有好，就要回前线去，你不允许，他就逃亡。”这个医院能容伤员六、七百人，开战以来，已有许多战士重上前线（包括院长所说的逃亡者）。院长说：现在是一切为了前线，在战争以前，这里是一所疗养院，专为军人设立的。这个温泉的水，含苏打甚多，含硫磺较少。人喝了，可治肠胃病。身体衰弱的人民军指战员，经过批准者可来休养。一般是休养二十天。据统计，休养者平均每十天可增加体重两公斤。他们吃的是牛乳、牛肉、面包、大米和蔬菜。一切完全免费。院长说：炮声一响，休养者立刻都出去了。休养所改成了陆军医院。
    更往前说，这地方是一个日本旅馆。“八一五”前，只有日本人和朝鲜地主，才能够到这里避暑休养，像人民军的战士他们绝大部分是工人和农民，是没有资格到这里住一住的。“八一五”后，日本旅馆被没收，又经过两年增修，改成疗养院。院长说：“以前，这么好的地方，谁不想多住几天？现在，伤还没有全好，他们就嚷着要出院。”
    元山市是我们这次旅行的终点。它是江原道的首府，坐落在绿色的朝鲜东海岸上。美国飞机炸毁了这个城市的一半，许多外国记者已经充分揭发了美国飞机轰炸和平人民的罪行。我们巡视了整个的城区。在废墟的底层，我发现了朝鲜人民坚强不屈的毅力。许多工人和市民填埋着数不清的弹坑，他们一面工作，一面谈论《劳动新闻》（朝鲜劳动党中央机关报）上登载的战争消息。工人们曾经在美国飞机的扫射声中，抢救被炸起火的工厂，全身被熏成一片焦黑。敌机走后，电话兵立刻就把电话线修好了。我曾经和市合作组合饭店中一位小女侍者谈话。她只有十几岁，但是，她说，她并不害怕这种残酷的轰炸。“这是为什么呢？”她说：“我是在国家的饭店中，为了祖国，我得坚持工作。”在一座被弹坑环绕的办公室中，我们和江原道道党部委员长林春秋同志谈话。他说：“元山市民的毅力是惊人的。它（指美国）轰炸，我参军，在地面上结果它。元山市民参军者已有三千余人，这是对于残暴的杜鲁门，麦克阿瑟之流一个最好的回答。”                            
        （二十二日）
