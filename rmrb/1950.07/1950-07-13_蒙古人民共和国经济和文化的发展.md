　　Economic and Cultural Development of the Mongolian People's Republic
    Translated by Xiao Feng
    The Truth Daily, published in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, has released figures illustrating the economic and cultural progress of the Republic in 1949 (the second year of the Five-Year Plan for economic development). The achievements obtained are significant.

    Animal husbandry is the main production of Mongolia. Last year, the total number of cattle increased by more than 1.3 million head. The progress of pastoral production cooperatives is particularly rapid: they now own 40.8% more cattle, horses, camels, and sheep than a year ago. The number of producer cooperatives has increased, and their organization has also improved.

    Agriculture has also made progress, with the grain planting area increasing by 74% and the harvest being much larger than the previous year. This is mainly due to the rapid mechanization of agriculture. In 1949, the number of tractors and harvesters used in the fields increased by nearly 50% compared to 1948.

    Before the revolution, Mongolia had no industry; after the revolution, factories were established with Soviet assistance. Industry also achieved success in the second year of the Five-Year Plan. Mining, metal, and logging industries increased production. The largest increase was in the manufacture of consumer goods. Automobiles carried more goods, and the first train appeared in the Republic's capital last year, speeding along the new railway between Ulaanbaatar and Nalaikh. It was also built with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union.

    Before the People's Revolution in Mongolia in 1921, there was only one school run by a monastery, with only 50 students. Today, all the people of the country have the opportunity to receive education. In 1949, a large number of doctors, veterinarians, and animal technicians graduated from the National University. The Teachers' College graduated 67 teachers, and various technical schools trained hundreds of experts.

    Culture and science have deeply penetrated the Mongolian steppes. The government budget for 1950 is vivid proof of this. Social and cultural undertakings will receive 100.4 million Mongolian currency units, an increase of 10.5% over last year. The number of schools, hospitals, and clinics in cities and villages will increase.

    It is significant that the funds for developing the national economy in 1950 will increase by 45.8%, while defense expenditures will decrease by 8.2%. Mongolia's two large neighbors are her friends—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—which reliably guarantees the independence and integrity of the Mongolian Republic.

    At its recent plenary session, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party stipulated that the task of all party and government organizations is to increase the total number of cattle in the country to 50 million head in the next five years. This means an increase of four times compared to the figure of 19.18 million before the revolution. In 1950, the number will increase by 1.54 million head, mainly high-grade dairy cattle. Grasslands and pastures will be improved, and thousands of wells will be renovated or dug in 1950, increasing irrigation to 5-6 million hectares of barren grasslands.

    The Mongolian People's Republic is advancing bravely and confidently along the road of democratic construction.

　　蒙古人民共和国经济和文化的发展
    小凤译
    在蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴特出版的真理报，公布了一些数字，说明共和国于一九四九年（经济发展五年计划的第二年）的经济的和文化的进展。所获得的成就是显著的。
    牧畜业是蒙古的主要生产。去年牛的总数增加了一百三十万头以上。牧人生产合作社的进展特别迅速：现在他们拥有的牛、马、骆驼及羊比一年前增加了百分之四十·八。生产者的合作社数目增多了，他们的组织也有了改进。
    农业也有进展，谷物种植面积已增加百分之七四，收成也比前一年大得多。这主要是由于农业的迅速机械化。一九四九年在田野使用的拖拉机及收割机比一九四八年增加了将近百分之五○。
    在革命以前蒙古没有工业；革命以后，在苏联援助下建立了工厂。工业在五年计划的第二年中也同样获得了成绩。采矿、金属及伐木工业增加出产。增进得最多的，是消费品的制造。汽车载运了更多的货物，去年在共和国的首都出现了第一辆火车，在乌兰巴特与那斯基间的新铁路上疾驶。它也是在苏联兄弟般的援助下所建筑的。
    蒙古在一九二一年人民革命以前，不是寺院所办的学校，只有一个，学生只五十人。今天全国人民都有受教育的机会。一九四九年，大批医生、兽医及动物技术家自国立大学卒业。教育学院有六十七名教师毕业，各种技术学校训练了几百位专家。
    文化与科学深透入蒙古草原。一九五○年政府预算就是生动的证明。社会及文化事业将得一亿零四十万蒙币，即比去年增加了百分之十·五。学校、医院及城市乡村间的医疗所的数量将增加。
    一九五○年发展国家经济的经费将增加百分之四五·八，而国防费用却减少了百分之八·二，这是很有意义的。蒙古接邻的两个大国是她的朋友——苏联和中华人民共和国——这就可靠地保证了蒙古共和国的独立和完整。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会在最近一次全体大会上，规定了一切党和政府组织的任务，是在今后的五年中增加全国牛的总数至五千万头。这意味着与革命前一九一八年的数字相比将增加四倍。一九五○年中要增加一百五十四万头，主要是高等乳牛。草地及牧场将被改进，一九五○年将修改或开凿水井数千口，增加灌溉五、六百万公顷不毛的草原。
    蒙古人民共和国正沿着民主建设的道路勇敢地和充满信心地前进。
