The entire faculty and students of the Central Academy of Drama, including President Ouyang Yuqian, Vice Presidents Cao Yu and Zhang Geng, Education Director Guang Weiran, wrote a letter on July 20th to Korean cultural and artistic workers to pay tribute to the Korean people. The full text is as follows:

Dear Korean cultural and artistic worker comrades:

The Korean people, in order to smash the aggressive actions of American imperialism, have carried out a great and glorious people's liberation war. In less than a month, they have liberated two-fifths of the southern Korean territory, annihilated the main force of the traitorous Syngman Rhee bandits, and inflicted heavy blows on the vicious and adventurous American land, sea, and air forces, exposing the ugly face of the American paper tiger to the world. This has left the increasingly isolated warmongers Truman, Acheson, and MacArthur in a state of panic, forcing them to pray for God's mercy!

Following closely on the heels of the Chinese people's great victory, the Korean people's brilliant victory has once again given tremendous inspiration to peace-loving people all over the world and greatly encouraged the oppressed nations of the East. Your brilliant victory is a tremendous contribution to crushing the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a third world war, to expanding and strengthening the prestige of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to striving for lasting world peace and people's democracy.

We salute General Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people! We salute all the commanders and fighters of the heroic Korean People's Army! We salute all the heroic Korean people! We salute all the Korean cultural workers and art workers who are fighting bravely in the front and rear, serving the people faithfully! And we wish you complete and thorough victory in advance!

　　中央戏剧学院全体教职学员致函
    朝鲜文艺工作者向朝鲜人民表示敬意
    【本报讯】中央戏剧学院院长欧阳予倩，副院长曹禺、张庚，教育长光未然暨全体教职学员，于七月二十日写信给朝鲜文化艺术工作者向朝鲜人民致敬。全文如下：
    敬爱的朝鲜文化艺术工作者同志们：
    朝鲜人民为了粉碎美帝国主义的侵略行动，进行了伟大的光荣的人民解放战争。在不到一个月的期间，解放了南部朝鲜五分之二的国土，歼灭了卖国贼李承晚匪徒的主力，使穷凶极恶冒险进犯的美国陆海空军受到惨重的打击，使得美国纸老虎的丑态暴露于全世界。使得日益孤立的战争贩子杜鲁门、艾奇逊、麦克阿瑟之流惊惶失措，只好祈求上帝的怜悯！
    紧接着中国人民的伟大胜利之后，朝鲜人民的辉煌胜利，再一次的给与全世界爱好和平的人民以极大的振奋，给与东方被压迫的民族以极大的鼓舞。你们的辉煌胜利，对于粉碎美帝国主义发动第三次世界大战的阴谋，对于扩大与增强以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的声威，对于争取世界的持久和平与人民民主，都是非常巨大的贡献。
    谨向朝鲜人民的伟大领袖金日成将军致敬！谨向朝鲜英勇的人民军全体指战员致敬！向英勇的全体朝鲜人民致敬！向前线后方一切奋不顾身为人民忠诚服务的朝鲜文化工作者、艺术工作者致敬！并预祝你们取得最后的彻底的胜利！（附图片）
