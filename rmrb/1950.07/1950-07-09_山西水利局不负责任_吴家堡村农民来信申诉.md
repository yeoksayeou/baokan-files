　　Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau Irresponsible
    Appeal Letter from Farmers of Wujiabao Village

    Editor:

    We are farmers from Wujiabao Village, Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. We have a problem that remains unresolved. In some villages in our neighboring county (Jin Yuan County), a canal was dug. Because the canal digging technology was poor, the water intake was dug too large, bringing in too much water from the Fen River, turning the canal into a river channel and collapsing several hectares of our village's land. Jin Yuan County discovered this problem and immediately requested instructions from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. The Taiyuan Municipal Government also requested instructions from the Water Conservancy Bureau. Initially, only one or two thousand catties of millet would have been needed to fix the canal, but the Water Conservancy Bureau didn't care. Later, the water in the canal eroded more and more, and it would cost four thousand catties of millet to fix it, but the Water Conservancy Bureau still didn't care. As a result, the canal eroded even more, more land collapsed, and it would cost ten thousand catties of millet to divert the water, but the Water Conservancy Bureau still didn't care. The problem grew bigger and bigger, and when it took forty thousand catties of millet to solve the problem, the Water Conservancy Bureau finally started to close the breach around May 10th. But the closure failed, forty thousand catties of millet were wasted, and the problem was still not resolved. After the Water Conservancy Bureau's failed closure, they ignored it again, saying that the village should build its own protective embankment. How could the village have the strength to solve this? Therefore, our land, houses, and lives are now threatened. We hope that the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau will conduct a self-criticism and solve this problem as soon as possible.

### 山西水利局不负责任  吴家堡村农民来信申诉

　　山西水利局不负责任
    吴家堡村农民来信申诉编辑先生：
    我们是山西太原市吴家堡村的农民。我们有一个问题得不到解决。在我们邻县（晋源县）有一些村庄开了一条渠，因为开渠的技术不好，吃水口挖得太大，把汾河里的水引进来太多，使渠道变成了河槽，冲塌我村好几顷土地。晋源县发现了这个问题，即请示省水利局。太原市政府也请示过水利局。开始有一两千斤小米就可把渠道治理好，但水利局不管。后来渠道里的水越冲越大，要治理得花四千斤米，但水利局还不管。于是渠道冲得更大了，地塌得更多了，想要退水非要花一万斤米不可，水利局还是不管。问题越弄越大，到了要四万斤米才能解决问题的时候，水利局才在五月十日前后进行合口。但是合口失败了，四万斤小米白花了，问题还是没有解决。水利局合口失败以后就又不管了，说是叫村里自己打护村埝。村里那有力量解决？因此现在我们的土地、房屋、生命都受到了威胁。我们希望山西水利局检讨，并从速解决这个问题。
