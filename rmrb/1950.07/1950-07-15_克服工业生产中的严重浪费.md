Overcoming Serious Waste in Industrial Production

There are still many serious instances of waste in our financial and economic work. There are three main types of waste: First, waste of cash, materials, and manpower due to poor management and improper use in financial and economic work; second, waste in industrial production; and third, some public servants and economic workers who do not cherish state property, are corrupt, or engage in extravagance and waste. The first type of waste was most serious in the early days of taking over major cities across the country. After the Central People's Government implemented unified management and leadership of financial and economic work in March of this year, this type of waste has been greatly reduced as a result of implementing measures such as managing cash, clearing warehouses, and reorganizing government personnel, and it will continue to decrease in the future. The third type of waste is completely illegal and dishonorable under the People's Government, and is more easily detected and opposed by the broad masses, so it is also easier to overcome. The second type of waste, namely waste in industrial production, is very harmful, but it has not yet been taken seriously by most people.

What are some serious manifestations of waste in industrial production in our country now? Here are some examples: (1) The production equipment of many factories has not been fully utilized, so production efficiency has not been brought into full play. For example, the average utilization rate of power plants in North China last year was only 28.4% of the equipment capacity. This year, it is planned to increase it to 34.5%. However, the average utilization rate of power plants in North China is still the highest in China. If calculated according to Soviet standards, the power generation of power plants in North China can be increased by 98% compared to this year's plan. (2) Many factories have not yet established technical norms, or the norms are unreasonable even if they exist. Therefore, a large amount of raw materials, materials, man-hours, fuel, and electricity are wasted. At the end of last year, thirty-one state-owned and public-owned factories in Qiqihar, Northeast China, checked various waste phenomena and found that more than 27.4 billion Northeast yuan were wasted in terms of raw materials, materials, labor, procurement and sales, and water and electricity fuel. (3) The quality of finished products produced by many factories is very low, and there are many defective products. For example, many of the bicycles manufactured in various places are of very poor quality and cannot be sold. The cement factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau in East China blindly produced rough and shoddy products. From November last year to April this year, the factory produced 6,000 tons of cement, all of which were substandard and had to be reworked. Many of the steel plates produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Northeast China are uneven and of inconsistent thickness. These losses are staggering. (4) Various accidents occur frequently in factories and mines throughout the country. For example, the Guangdong Textile Factory damaged its turbine generator in April, resulting in a monthly loss of more than 110 million yuan. There are many other accidents that have occurred in factories and mines in various places. (5) In some industrial sectors, there is a serious state of replacing planning with fantasy in basic construction, blindly constructing without investigation and research, and without scientific technical design and planning. For example, the Northwest Highway Bureau spent nearly four months and 30 million yuan in people's currency to manufacture a trackless car in December last year, but it completely failed.

Waste in industrial production, like all other forms of waste, weakens the funds for national industrialization, objectively delays the speed of national industrialization, and is a major enemy on the road to national industrialization. The industrialization of any country must go through the process of accumulating funds, and in a country like China, thrift is of paramount importance for the accumulation of funds. In his report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policies of the Party" in 1926, Stalin pointed out that there are four ways for countries around the world to accumulate funds for industrialization:

"British industrialization was accelerated because Britain plundered colonies for decades and centuries, collected 'additional' capital from the colonies, and invested these capitals in its own industry. This is one method of industrialization.

Germany accelerated its industrialization as a result of its victory in the war against France in the 1870s, when Germany extracted 5 billion francs in reparations from France and invested them in its own industry. This is the second method of industrialization.

Both of these methods are impossible for us because we are a Soviet state and because the plunder of colonies and military aggression for the purpose of plunder are incompatible with the nature of the Soviet regime.

Russia, old Russia, gave up enslaving concessions and obtained enslaving loans, trying to gradually embark on the road to industrialization. This is the third method. But this is a road of enslavement or semi-enslavement, a road that turns Russia into a semi-colony. This road is also impossible for us, because we fought a three-year civil war and repelled all interventionists, not to voluntarily submit to imperialist enslavement after defeating the interventionists.

There is also a fourth road to industrialization, a road of self-saving for industry, a road of socialist accumulation. Comrade Lenin has repeatedly pointed out that this is the only road to industrialization in our country."

Obviously, we can only adopt the fourth method like the Soviet Union, that is, the method of saving to accumulate funds.

Why are there still phenomena of waste that undermine thrift in industrial production in New China?

There are two basic reasons here: First, many heads of industrial departments do not yet understand the serious significance of accumulating funds for industrialization. They are accustomed to reaching out to higher authorities for money, but they do not understand and cannot implement accumulation within the industry. It should be pointed out to these comrades that no funds fall from the sky and are inexhaustible. Only by implementing thrift can we always maintain the funds necessary for developing industry under the current conditions.

Second, many heads of industrial departments have not yet learned how to manage enterprises, especially they do not recognize the importance of economic accounting. They are still implementing backward management methods that are not enterprise-oriented for very complex modern industries.

Some heads of industrial departments, when managing industry, only seek to complete production tasks, but do not calculate production costs. They do not know the production capacity, product specifications, and the cost and price of the products of the enterprises they manage. Therefore, when waste occurs in the industry they manage, they often do not even know it themselves. Of course, this style has its historical roots. During the guerrilla war period, in the liberated areas that were divided and blockaded by the enemy, the People's Liberation Army established some necessary military industries. At that time, it was very difficult to obtain machinery and equipment and raw materials, but the war tasks were very urgent. In order to win the victory of the war, these military industries had to spend a high price to complete the production tasks of supplying military needs. In that historical period, this practice of producing for military purposes, although it cannot be said to be completely correct, is still excusable. However, now we have basically entered a period of peaceful construction, and our industry is already producing for economic purposes. Reducing costs is the central link in accumulating funds and increasing the sales volume of industrial products. It is impossible to carry out economic construction without following economic laws. If this old "military industry" style is not completely changed, it will seriously hinder our progress and become the ideological root of a large amount of waste.

Not adopting economic accounting to manage industry is due not only to the "military industry style" but also to the fact that some heads of industrial departments manage enterprises with bureaucratic methods. They are more enthusiastic about empty and abstract "politics," are busy with administrative affairs all day long, but lack enterprise-oriented thinking, do not understand the importance of economic accounting, and do not seriously study scientific knowledge and science and technology. Therefore, they will not grasp the central link of industrial management, and will not organize and lead workers to strive for increasing output, improving quality, practicing thrift, and reducing costs. In the industries they manage, the situation is often chaotic, various necessary systems have not been established, so that some industries have been taken over for two or three years, and still continue to experience alarming waste.

In order to eliminate waste in industrial production, an economic accounting system must be established. All heads of industrial departments should fully understand that the practice of only seeking to complete production tasks without calculating production costs is extremely harmful. Without calculating costs, it is impossible to reduce costs, and if costs are too high, production will inevitably be in deficit, and the entire factory will gradually collapse. How can any production tasks be completed then? Heads of industrial departments must "have a clear understanding" and must learn management and technology to truly become experts. Only in this way can they be meticulous in their calculations, recognize various forms of waste, formulate scientific improvement measures, and lead the broad masses of workers to carry out a mass anti-waste movement.

What problems need to be solved to implement economic accounting? The most important thing is to solve two problems: one is quota management, and the other is the production responsibility system.

The so-called quota should include quantitative, qualitative, time-based, staffing, and material aspects. Implementing quota management means specifying how much material, how much labor, how many man-hours, and how much product with certain specifications should be produced. Implementing quota management enables us to accurately calculate costs, strictly compare profits and losses, and gradually find the path to scientific management. At present, most state-owned industries in Northeast China have implemented quota management. Most industries in China have not yet found reasonable quotas, but if they can verify fixed assets and working capital, eliminate departmentalism, clear out a large backlog of raw materials, and overcome the phenomenon of backlog of funds, it will be an important achievement.

Some heads of industry say: "My factory has only been liberated for a short time, and it is impossible to implement quota management." This statement is incorrect. Indeed, the factories we took over from the Kuomintang bandits are generally poorly managed, with chaotic organizations and systems. It is indeed difficult to implement quota management in such factories. However, as long as leading cadres are good at relying on the working class, these difficulties can be overcome. Because workers have been working in certain factories for a long time, using certain machines, and producing certain commodities for a long time, they are fully aware of these things. Leaders only need to combine theoretical standards with the practical experience of workers to formulate preliminary quotas. These preliminary quotas can be gradually revised in the production process to generate reasonable quotas. Since last year, Northeast China has launched a movement to create new records, mobilizing workers to use their brains, come up with ideas, and find ways to increase output, improve quality, and reduce production costs. In four months, employees of 244 factories submitted 959 inventions and creations and 2,944 technical improvements. These inventions and creations and technical improvements have become the basis for determining reasonable quotas. This experience of Northeast China should be promoted to the whole country in a step-by-step manner. All factories where workers have been initially mobilized and trade unions have been organized can launch preliminary production competitions to create new records in various aspects as the basis for formulating production quotas. Production competitions should pay attention to technical quotas, and production should be combined with the needs of the masses so that products can be sold. When determining production quotas, the principle that quotas should be between advanced standards and general standards should be adhered to, and a bonus system for exceeding quotas should be implemented. This method can enable advanced producers to continue to improve technology, and enable workers with lower technology to gradually reach the level of the new quota. In order to launch production competitions, democratic management must be implemented to improve workers' awareness and enthusiasm. Countless facts have proven that if leaders cannot rely on the working class, no quota management can be established, and even if it is reluctantly established, it cannot be implemented.

The production responsibility system is the basic principle of industrial management. Without the guarantee of the responsibility system, quota management will fall through. In the industry of our country, the phenomenon of no one being responsible for management systems and lax production discipline still exists universally. In order to overcome these phenomena, a production responsibility system must be established from top to bottom, clearly stipulating the scope of work, responsibilities, and tasks of each person in the factory, so that every job, every machine, and every material is fully responsible by a dedicated person. For example: the responsibility for machine maintenance, the responsibility for material supply, the responsibility for production safety, the responsibility for finished product inspection, etc. This system can improve the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of all management personnel, technical personnel, and workers, so that everyone can consciously tighten every production link, overcome various wastes in the production process, and complete production tasks.

After formulating various systems for quota management and the responsibility system for production, they must be resolutely implemented and put into effect. In order to implement them, a strict reward and punishment system must be formulated, so that the good or bad performance of everyone from the most responsible factory director and engineer to every ordinary worker can be rewarded and punished accordingly, so that right and wrong can be clearly distinguished, and quota management and the responsibility system can be implemented. Without the necessary rewards and punishments, no system can be implemented.

Practicing thrift to accumulate funds for industrialization is a long-term and arduous struggle task. We believe that as long as the heads of all industrial departments truly recognize the paramount importance of this work, attract the broad masses of employees into the thrift movement, and earnestly implement the economic accounting system, then we will surely be able to overcome waste and accelerate the process of our national industrialization.

### 克服工业生产中的严重浪费

　　克服工业生产中的严重浪费
    我们财政经济工作中还存在许多严重的浪费现象。主要的浪费有三种：第一、在财经工作中，由于管理不善，运用不当而产生的现金、物资与人力的浪费；第二、工业生产中的浪费；第三、某些公务人员和经济工作人员，不爱惜国家财产，贪污腐化或铺张浪费。第一种浪费，在接管全国各大城市的初期，最为严重。今年三月，中央人民政府实行财政经济工作统一管理与统一领导之后，由于实行管理现金，清理仓库，与整编机关人员等项办法的结果，这一方面的浪费，已经有了很大的减少，以后还将继续减少。第三种浪费在人民政府下完全处于非法的和不名誉的地位，比较容易被广大群众所发觉和反对，因此也比较容易克服。第二种浪费，即工业生产中的浪费，危害很大，却还没有被多数人所重视。
    现在我国工业生产中的浪费有些什么严重的现象呢？可以举下面这些例子：（一）许多工厂的生产设备还未充分利用，因此生产效率还没有发挥出来。例如去年华北各发电厂的平均利用率，只占设备能力的百分之二十八点四。今年计划提高至百分之三十四点五。而华北各电厂的平均利用率，还是关内最高的。如果按照苏联的标准计算，华北各发电厂的发电量，还可比今年的计划增加百分之九十八。（二）许多工厂还没有建立技术定额，或虽有定额而不合理。因此，浪费了大量的原料、材料、工时、燃料和电力。东北齐齐哈尔三十一个国营公营工厂，在去年年底曾经检查各种浪费现象，发现在原料、材料、劳动力使用、采购运销、水电燃料等方面，共浪费东北币二百七十四亿余元。（三）许多工厂所产成品，质量很低，废品很多。例如各地所造自行车，有很多的质量很坏，卖不出去。华东区济南工业局洋灰厂盲目生产，粗制滥造。从去年十一月至今年四月，该厂生产六千吨洋灰，均不合规格，须全部翻工。东北鞍山钢铁公司所制钢板有许多不平，而且厚度不一。这些损失是惊人的。（四）全国各地工厂矿山中，经常发生各种事故。例如广东纺织厂于四月间损坏了透平发电机，每月损失一亿一千余万元。其他各地工厂矿山所发生的各种事故还有很多。（五）若干工业部门，在基本建设中，存在着以空想代替计划的严重状态，不进行调查研究，不作科学的技术设计与计划，即盲目建设。例如西北公路局在去年十二月制造无轨车，耗时几近四个月，耗费人民券三千万元，结果完全失败。
    工业生产中的浪费和其他各种浪费一样，其性质都是削弱国家工业化的资金，客观上是迟滞国家工业化的速度，是使国家工业化道路上一个很大的敌人。任何国家的工业化，都必须经过积累资金的过程，而在象中国这样的国家，节约对于资金的积累就有头等的重要性。斯大林在一九二六年《论苏联经济形势与党的政策》的报告中曾经指出，世界各国积累工业化资金的方式有四种：
    “英国的工业化，是由于英国掠夺了几十年几百年的殖民地，从殖民地收集了‘附加’资本，把这些资本投入自己的工业，而加快了自己工业化的速度。这是一种工业化的方法。
    德国是在上一世纪七十年代对法胜利战争的结果而加速了自己的工业化，那时德国从法国索取了五十万万赔款，投入自己的工业。这是第二种工业化的方法。
    这两种方法对我们都是走不通的，因为我们是苏维埃国家，因为殖民地的掠夺和以掠夺为目的的军事侵略是与苏维埃政权的本性不相容的。
    俄国，旧的俄国，曾让出了奴役性的租让地，取得了奴役性借款，力谋以此逐步走上工业化的道路。这是第三种方法。但是这是一种奴役或半奴役的道路，把俄国变为半殖民地的道路。这条道路对我们也是走不通的，因为我们进行了三年国内战争，击退所有一切干涉者，并不是为了在战胜干涉者以后，又去自愿地受帝国主义的奴役。
    还有第四条工业化的道路，为了工业而自己节约的道路，社会主义积累的道路。这条道路，列宁同志曾多次指出过，乃是我国工业化的唯一道路。”
    很明显，我们也只能和苏联一样采取第四种方法，即是用节约以积累资金的方法。
    在新中国的工业生产中，为什么还有破坏节约的浪费现象呢？
    在这里，有两个基本原因：第一、有许多工业部门的负责人，还不懂得为了工业化而积累资金的严重意义。他们习惯于向上级伸手要钱，但是不懂和不会在工业内部实行积累。应该向这些同志指明：任何资金都不是从天上掉下来的，都不是用之不竭的。只有实行节约的方法，才能使我们经常保有为在目前条件下发展工业所必要的资金。
    第二、有许多工业部门的负责人，还没有学会管理企业，特别是不认识经济核算制的重要性。他们对于非常复杂的现代化工业，还在实行着非企业化的落后的管理方法。
    有些工业部门的负责人，他们在管理工业时，只求完成生产任务，但不计算生产成本。他们不晓得自己所管理的企业的生产能力，产品规格，以及产品的成本和价格。因此，他所管理的工业中发生了浪费现象，往往自己还不知道。当然，这种作风是有其历史根源的。在游击战争时期，在解放区被敌人分割、封锁的情况下，那时的人民解放军曾经建立了一些必需的军事工业。那时候，取得机器设备和原料材料是非常困难，而战争任务却是很紧迫的。为了争取战争的胜利，这些军事工业曾经不能不花费高贵的代价，完成供应军事需要的生产任务。在那种历史时期，为了军事目的而生产，这种作法虽不能说是完全正确的，但是还可以原谅。但是，现在已基本上进入和平的建设时期，我们的工业已经是为经济目的而生产了。减低成本，正是积累资金与增加工业品销售量的中心环节。不按经济规律办事，就不可能进行经济建设。这种旧的“军工”作风如不彻底改变，就会严重地阻碍我们的进步，成为大量浪费的思想根源。
    不采用经济核算制来管理工业，除了由于“军工作风”外，还由于有些工业部门的负责人，用官僚主义的方法管理企业。他们比较热心于空洞抽象的“政治”，成天忙于行政事务，但是缺乏企业化的思想，不懂经济核算的重要性，不认真学习科学知识和科学技术。因此，他们就不会抓住工业管理的中心环节，不会组织与领导工人为增加产量、提高质量、厉行节约、降低成本而努力。在他们管理的工业中，情况往往是混乱的，各种必要的制度没有建立起来，以致有些工业已经接收了两三年，还继续发生惊人的浪费现象。
    为了消灭工业生产中的浪费现象，必须建立经济核算制度。应该让所有工业部门的负责人完全懂得，只求完成生产任务，不计算生产成本的作法是极端有害的。不计算成本，即无法降低成本，而成本过高，生产势必亏累，整个工厂都会逐渐垮台，还完成什么生产任务呢？工业部门的负责人要作到“心中有数”，必须学会管理，学会技术，使自己真正成为内行。只有如此，他才可能精打细算，才能认识各种各样的浪费现象，定出科学的改进办法，领导广大职工，开展群众性的反浪费运动。
    实行经济核算，需要解决什么问题呢？最重要的是解决两个问题：一是定额管理，一是生产责任制。
    所谓定额，应该包括定量、定质、定时、定员、定料等方面。实行定额管理，就是规定出用多少材料，多少人力，多少工时，生产多少具有一定规格的产品。实行了定额管理，就能够精确地计算成本，严格地比较盈亏，逐步找到科学管理的道路。现在东北绝大部分国营工业，都已实行了定额管理。关内大部分工业，还没有找到合理的定额，但如果能核定固定资金与流动资金，肃清本位主义思想，清出大量积压的原料材料，克服积压资金的现象，就是一个重要的成就。
    有些工业的负责人说：“我这个工厂解放时间还短，无法实行定额管理。”这种说法是不对的。的确，我们从国民党匪帮手中接收的工厂，一般都是管理腐败，机构和制度混乱不堪。在这种工厂中实行定额管理，的确有许多困难。但是，只要领导干部善于依靠工人阶级，这些困难是可以克服的。因为工人长期在一定的工厂作工，长期使用一定的机器，生产一定的商品，对于这些，他们完全是了然的，领导者只要能把理论的标准和工人的实际经验结合起来，就可以定出初步的定额，这种初步定额在生产过程中逐步修正，即可产生合理的定额。东北从去年开展创造新纪录运动，发动工人动脑筋，出主意，想办法，提高产量质量，降低生产成本。在四个月中，二百四十四个工厂的职工，提出发明创造九百五十九件，技术改进二千九百四十四件，这些发明创造和技术改进，曾经成为确定合理定额的基础。东北区这个经验，应该有步骤地向全国推广。凡是工人已经初步发动，工会已经组织起来的工厂，都可以发动初步的生产竞赛，创造各方面的新纪录，作为制定生产定额的基础。生产竞赛，应注意技术定额，要使生产与群众需要相结合，产品才能有销路。在确定生产定额时，应该坚持定额介乎先进标准与一般标准之间的原则，并实行超额奖励制度。这种办法，能使先进生产者继续改进技术，使技术较低的工人，逐渐达到新定额的水平。为了发动生产竞赛，必须实行民主管理，提高工人的觉悟和积极性。无数事实证明，领导者如果不能依靠工人阶级，任何定额管理都不可能建立起来，即使勉强建立起来，也不可能贯彻下去。
    生产责任制是工业管理的基本原则。没有责任制的保证，定额管理就会落空。在我们国家的工业中，目前还普遍存在着管理制度无人负责，和生产纪律松懈的现象。为了克服这些现象，必须从上而下地建立生产责任制，明确地规定工厂中每一个人的工作范围、职责和任务，使每一件工作，每一部机器，每一种材料，都有专人负完全责任。例如：机器保管的责任，材料供应的责任，生产安全的责任，成品检验的责任等等。这种制度，可以提高所有管理人员、技术人员和工人群众的积极性与责任心，使每一个人能够自觉地扣紧每一个生产环节，克服生产过程中的各种浪费，完成生产任务。
    定出生产的定额管理和负责制的各种制度之后，就必须坚决地付之实施，加以贯彻。而要加以贯彻，就必须定出严格的奖惩制度，应使从最负责的工厂厂长和工程师起到每一个普通工人在工作中的好坏，能够受到应有的奖励和处罚，如此，才能使是非善恶分明，定额管理与负责制才能贯彻。如果没有必要的奖励与处分，任何制度都是不能贯彻的。
    厉行节约以积累工业化资金，这是一个长期而艰苦的斗争任务。我们相信，只要所有工业部门的负责人，真正认清了这件工作的头等重要的意义，把广大职工吸引到节约运动中来，认真实行经济核算制度，那么，我们就一定能够克服浪费现象，一定能够加速我们国家工业化的进程。
