    Dalian Machinery Factory Foundry Technicians Cooperate with Workers to Eliminate Defective Products and Set a Record
    At the Dalian Machinery Factory Foundry, technicians and workers have closely cooperated to significantly reduce defective iron and copper castings. In the second group of the workshop, when making sand molds, based on the technician's report, the size of the "water inlet" and "riser" was determined according to the iron melt temperature, ensuring smooth flow of moisture in the sand box when pouring iron, which makes it less prone to produce "sand holes." This group did not produce a single defective product in May, creating a new record for eliminating defective products.
    Shenyang Electrical Engineering Third Factory Establishes Technical Research Association
    Under the leadership of engineers, the Shenyang Electrical Engineering Third Factory established a Technical Research Association, which discusses product quality issues twice a week. At this meeting, the workers' ideological resistance to the implementation of technical regulations was eliminated, and the unity between workers and technical personnel was strengthened. At the same time, the factory established an inspection team in May, selecting experienced veteran technicians to be responsible for inspection. The electric light bulbs produced by the factory completely eliminated defective products in May, and the defect rate dropped from 40% to 19%.
        Pei Quanxian Unites Workers to Successfully Transform Electric Furnace
    Pei Quanxian, a technician at Tianjin Steel Plant, united with workers and successfully transformed the electric furnace. Before liberation, the electric furnace in the factory could only be used five or six times after each major repair. After liberation, it could only be used seventeen to twenty-two times. However, it was known theoretically that a normal electric furnace could be used sixty times after a major repair. Pei Quanxian and his fellow workers studied together and discovered that because the silica brick is acidic and the steel slag is alkaline, the two would dissolve when they meet. Therefore, they changed the method of repairing the furnace, reducing one layer of the three layers of silica brick on the furnace wall and replacing the bottom layer with magnesite, so that the steel slag would not touch the silica brick. At the same time, they adjusted the distance of the three electrodes that were too close to the furnace wall. From the major repair on April 10th to May 18th, they created an unprecedented record of producing forty furnaces of steel.

    Yangquan Mining Bureau Tests Production Technical Personnel
    The Yangquan Mining Bureau, following the order of the North China Coal Mine Management Bureau, held a major test for production technical personnel on May 23 in order to strengthen the technical personnel's attention to safety work. All kinds of technical personnel, from the mine manager downwards, participated. As a result, the average score of eighty-nine papers was 72.7 points. Three people failed, including two mine managers and one coal engineer. Lu Shun, an elderly electromechanical worker who was sixty-eight years old, could not write, so he dictated it and someone else wrote it for him, and he got full marks.

    Xinhailian Huaxing Iron Factory Completes Production of Four Hundred Waterwheels Ahead of Schedule
    In the Red May competition, the Xinhailian State-owned Huaxing Iron Factory completed the task of rushing to produce 400 Liberation-style waterwheels, which started in March, five days ahead of schedule, saving raw materials worth more than 12,000 catties of wheat. The Longdong Match Factory in the city also exceeded the plan by 108% with twenty-five days of production.

    大连机械工厂铸造场技师与工人合作消灭废品创纪录
    大连机械工厂铸造场技师与工友密切结合，铸铁、铸铜废品显著减少。该场第二小组做砂型时，根据技师的报告，以铁水温度的高低确定留“水做”、“冒口”的大小，保证了倒铁水时砂箱内的潮气畅流，不易出“砂眼”。该小组在五月份没出一点废品，创造出消灭废品的新纪录。
    沈阳电工第三厂成立技术研究会
    沈阳电工三厂在工程师领导下成立了技术研究会，每周讨论两次产品质量问题。在这个会议上，解除了工人对执行技术规程的思想抵抗，加强了工人与技术人员的团结。同时该厂在五月份成立了检查小组，选出技术较好的老技工负责检查。该厂所产电灯泡五月份完全消灭了次品，废品率由百分之四十降为百分之十九。
        裴铨先团结工人改造电炉已成功
    天津制钢厂技术员裴铨先与工人团结，改造电炉成功。解放前，该厂电炉大修一次只能用五、六次；解放后也只能用十七至二十二次。但是从理论上知道，一个正常的电炉经大修后能用六十次。裴铨先和工友在一起研究，发现了因为矽砖是酸性，钢渣是碱性，二者相遇就溶化了。于是他们改变了修炉的方法，把炉墙的三层矽砖减去一层，把最下边的一层用镁砂代替，使钢渣碰不到矽砖。同时他们又调整了靠炉墙太近的三根电极的距离。四月十日大修至五月十八日已创造了出钢四十炉的空前未有的纪录。

    阳泉矿务局测验生产技术人员
    阳泉矿务局奉华北煤矿管理总局令，为加强技术人员对保安工作的重视程度，于五月二十三日举行生产技术人员大测验。自矿长以下各种技术人员一律参加。结果八十九份卷子平均为七十二点七分。不及格的有三人，其中两个是矿长，一个是煤师。六十八岁的老机电工作者吕顺同志不会写字，由他口述别人给代笔写，结果得了满分。

    新海连华兴铁工厂提前制成四百部水车
    新海连公营华兴铁工厂在红五月竞赛中，提前五天完成了三月份动工赶制的四百部解放式水车的任务，节省原料计值小麦一万二千余斤。该市陇东火柴厂亦以二十五天的生产，超额完成计划百分之一○八。
