　　Li Moqing, the business section chief of the Tongxian Branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, colluded with the private merchant Yihe Trading Company to leak market information during the price fluctuations on July 11th of last year. When the Beijing Branch called daily to provide market updates, he would first relay this information to Yihe Trading Company, which then used this opportunity for speculative activities.

　　To prevent private merchants from speculating, the company originally stipulated that each person could only buy half a *pi* to one *pi* of cloth at a time. However, Yihe Trading Company would buy several *pi* at a time. When the sales department refused to sell, Li Moqing would act like the head of the business section, saying, "I, the head of the business section, am responsible; no one else can interfere!" And each time, he would sell the full amount, even whole bolts (twenty *pi*), to Yihe Trading Company. Sometimes, when the company's listed price had already increased by the time the company came to order or buy cloth, he would still sell to the company at the unincreased price. This way, the company lost three to four thousand yuan on each *pi* of cloth sold. On two other occasions, when Yihe Trading Company came to buy more than ten *pi* of cloth, the sales department was unwilling to sell because the business hours had passed. Li Moqing insisted on selling it with a very bad attitude. In this way, Yihe Trading Company bought more than 300 *pi* of cloth from the company, causing great losses to the people's property.

　　This year, the Tongxian cotton purchase market established a purchasing committee, stipulating that the company's cotton purchase accounted for 70 percent of the market, and private and public factories accounted for 30 percent. In order to facilitate speculation by private merchants, Li Moqing sold half of the 70 percent to private merchants, who then processed it and sold the lint cotton back to the company. Private merchants added water during processing, earning 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per hundred *jin* of lint cotton. In addition, Li Moqing spread emotions that made people uneasy at work in the company. He said to the cadres who worked in accounting, "There is no future in accounting, it's the same old thing; you can grasp the policies when you do business." This greatly affected their work morale. In order to strictly implement economic policies and discipline, the company leadership has handed Li Moqing over to the Tongxian People's Court for legal action.

　　通县花纱布支公司李墨卿勾结奸商已受法办
    通县花纱布支公司业务股长李墨卿，在去年七月十一日物价波动时，与私商益和号勾结，暴露行情。当北京分公司每天来电话告诉行情时，他首先传达给益和号。益和号便利用这个机会进行投机活动。
    公司为了防止私商投机，原规定每人每次只许买布半匹至一匹，但益和号一买便是数匹。门市部不同意卖时，李墨卿就拿出业务股长的架子说：“由我业务股长负责，别人管不着！”而每次总是照数甚至整件（二十匹）的卖给益和号，有时该号来订布或买布时，公司牌价已涨钱了，但仍按未涨的价格卖给该号。这样公司卖出一匹布要吃三四千元的亏。还有两次，益和号来买十数匹布，门市部因营业时间已过，不愿卖了。李墨卿便态度很不好地硬要卖。就这样，公司被益和号共买去了三百余匹布，使人民财产受到很大损失。
    今年，通县收花市场建立了采购委员会，规定公司收花占市场百分之七十，私营及公营工厂占百分之三十。李墨卿为了便利私商投机，竟将百分之七十的二分之一卖给私商，经加工后再将皮棉卖给公司。私商在加工时掺水，每百斤皮棉可赚七八万元。此外，李墨卿在公司中传布使人不安心工作的情绪。他对作会计工作的干部说：“作会计没前途，老一套；作业务可以掌握政策。”因此大大地影响了他们的工作情绪。公司领导上为了严格执行经济政策纪律，已将李墨卿交由通县人民法院依法处理。
