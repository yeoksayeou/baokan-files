Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd—Park Heon-yeong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a lengthy statement on the 1st regarding the two statements made by U.S. President Truman on June 27th and 30th, stating: The U.S. imperialists' policy of enslaving the Korean people and their policy of treating Korea as an American-style colony has today turned into blatant armed intervention against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

After recounting the various criminal activities carried out by U.S. imperialism in Korea during the post-war period, Park Heon-yeong pointed out that on June 25th, the Syngman Rhee puppet government, under the direction of its American masters, launched a civil war in Korea. U.S. imperialism provoked this war in an attempt to defeat the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through armed intervention.

Park Heon-yeong declared: U.S. imperialism is attempting to conceal its intervention under the name of the United Nations. The Security Council's decision, manufactured according to American instructions, is invalid and violates the United Nations Charter. This is because the resolution was passed at a meeting in which the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not participate, and the representatives of the Security Council's permanent members—the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—did not participate.

After describing the victorious operations of the People's Army, Park Heon-yeong emphasized that today, the collapse of the Syngman Rhee regime has become a clear fact. Seeing its plan to colonize Korea collapsing, U.S. imperialism has intensified its armed intervention against the Korean people. However, this cannot intimidate the freedom-loving Korean people. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people oppose American armed intervention in Korea, oppose the barbarous bombing of Korean cities and villages, oppose the inhuman massacres perpetrated against peaceful residents, and resolutely rise up in protest.

Park Heon-yeong finally declared: We believe that our just cause will receive the deep sympathy of all people.

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国
    朴宪永外长发表声明
    指出李承晚政权的破产已成事实  美帝武装干涉恫吓不了朝鲜人民
    【新华社平壤二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部长朴宪永于一日就美总统杜鲁门六月二十七日与三十日的两次声明发表长篇声明称：美国帝国主义者将朝鲜人民奴隶化的政策与美国式殖民地的政策，在今天已转变为反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的露骨的武装干涉了。
    朴宪永在回溯美帝国主义于战后时期在朝鲜所进行的种种罪恶活动之后指出，六月二十五日，李承晚傀儡政府在它的美国主子的指使下，在朝鲜发动了内战。美帝国主义挑起这个战争，是企图以武装干涉的方法，将朝鲜民主主义人民共和国打败。
    朴宪永宣称：美帝国主义企图以联合国的名义来隐蔽自己的干涉。根据美国人的指示所制造出来的安理会的决定，是没有效力的，是违背联合国宪章的。因为这是在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表没有参加，在安理会常任理事国——伟大的苏联与中华人民共和国的代表没有参加的会上所通过的决议。
    朴宪永在叙述了人民军的胜利作战之后强调指出，今天，李承晚政权的破产，已成为明白的事实。美帝国主义看到殖民地化朝鲜的计划在崩溃中，它就加强反对朝鲜人民的武装干涉。但是，这不能恫吓爱好自由的朝鲜人民。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府与全体朝鲜人民，反对美国对于朝鲜的武装干涉，反对对于朝鲜城市与乡村的野蛮轰炸，反对向和平居民施行惨无人道的屠杀，并坚决地起来抗议。
    朴宪永最后宣称：我们相信，我们的正义事业，将受到所有人民的深厚同情。
