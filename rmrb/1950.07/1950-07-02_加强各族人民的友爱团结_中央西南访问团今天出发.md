　　Strengthen the Friendship and Unity of All Ethnic Groups
    Central Southwest Visiting Group Departs Today

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Central Visiting Group, representing the Central People's Government and various people's organizations, which will visit the various ethnic groups in Southwest China, departed from the capital today. The mission of the visiting group is to strengthen national unity, understand the hardships of the various ethnic groups, make the first equal and friendly visit to the various ethnic groups in history, and bring the opinions of the various ethnic groups directly to the Central Government. The visiting group includes more than 20 units such as the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Cultural and Educational Commission, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Trade, and the Central Committee of the Youth League. Liu Geping is the head of the group, and Fei Xiaotong and Xia Kangnong are the deputy heads. There are more than 120 members in the group, divided into three subgroups. Each subgroup is equipped with a cultural troupe, a medical team, a recording team, a photography team, a film projection team and other organizations. The entire group has undergone more than a month of study, and has successively listened to reports from Li Weihan, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Wang Weizhou, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and others on national policies and the situation in the southwestern provinces. They also gained a preliminary understanding of the customs of the various ethnic groups in Southwest China. The three subgroups will conduct visits to the fraternal ethnic regions in Sichuan, Kangding, Yunnan, and Guizhou respectively.

    [Another Dispatch] All parties in the capital attach great importance to the Central Visiting Group's visit to the fraternal ethnic groups in Southwest China. Li Weihan, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central Committee, Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Wang Weizhou, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, all gave instructions to the visiting group. Deng Yingchao hoped that the visiting group would learn more about the hardships of the lives of the various ethnic groups and bring back more opinions from the various ethnic groups, especially female compatriots. Director Li Weihan pointed out that the main task of the visiting group is to communicate and harmonize the feelings between ethnic groups and return with satisfaction. Therefore, all work and actions of the visiting group must obtain the consent of the local fraternal ethnic groups. General Wang Weizhou said: The people of Southwest China warmly welcome the Central Visiting Group, and all sectors in the Southwest will do their best to assist the visiting group in completing this glorious task of historical significance.

    Liang Juwu (Miao nationality), a specially invited representative of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Wen Shaohe (Hui nationality), a representative, described the devastation suffered by the Miao and Hui ethnic groups under the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties, and pointed out that the Central Visiting Group's equal and friendly visit to the fraternal ethnic groups is the first in history. The visiting group will play a bridging role in communicating ethnic feelings and harmonizing ethnic relations.

    At the evening party jointly held by the Cultural and Educational Commission and the Nationalities Affairs Commission to bid farewell to the Central Visiting Group, Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Commission, pointed out: China's ethnic minorities were not born backward. For example, rice plants originally grew in Indochina, and then were introduced from the southwest. When drinking water, we should think of the source. We should express our gratitude to the various ethnic groups in Southwest China. He urged all members of the visiting group to adopt a humble and learning attitude, to eliminate the historical barriers between ethnic groups in the past, and to learn from their rich artistic treasures.

    The Ministry of Culture also held an evening party to bid farewell to the cultural and educational workers of the Central Visiting Group. At the meeting, Minister Shen Yanbing, Vice Ministers Zhou Yang and Ding Xie Lin, and Vice President Cao Yu of the Central Academy of Drama repeatedly encouraged the visiting group. Zhou Yang encouraged the cultural and educational workers of the visiting group to introduce the existing people's art to the fraternal ethnic groups, and to absorb the vital art of the fraternal ethnic groups, and to promote unity between ethnic groups through art. He asked the cultural and educational workers of the visiting group to be considerate of the feelings of the fraternal ethnic groups and to do a good job in ethnic relations with unlimited enthusiasm; at the same time, they must be realistic and abandon the views and attitudes of "hunting for curiosities."
