(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou) In Wuhan City, labor-management consultation meetings have been gradually established in more than 30 factories and stores in over ten industries, including private industry and commerce, such as textiles, cloth, and printing, as well as Shenxin Yarn Factory and Yihe Cloth Store, since late March. The main content of the consultation meetings in various industries is to actively find ways to improve management and increase production. For example, of the 28 articles in the first agreement of Shenxin Yarn Factory, 26 articles are about improving machinery and equipment, reforming management systems, strengthening production planning, establishing reward and punishment assessment committees, saving raw materials, reducing waste, and increasing the quantity and quality of products. These agreements have now begun to be implemented. In addition, certain agreements have been reached on changing certain working methods to improve the quality of yarn. Appropriate solutions have also been found for urgent issues such as maternity benefits for female workers and medical treatment for workers, based on specific circumstances.

In the labor-management consultation meetings of industries with greater current difficulties, such as cigarettes, soap, matches, and flour, the content of the consultation is mainly to save expenses and reduce costs in order to maintain production and overcome difficulties.

During the consultations, many enterprises' labor sides actively assisted the capital side in overcoming difficulties by appropriately reducing treatment and suggesting that the capital side improve management. This has gradually dispelled the concerns of some capitalists and increased their enthusiasm for management. For example, the capital side of Huashen, Xiecheng, and Jiuda in the cloth industry jointly increased their investment by 280 bolts of cloth to jointly maintain business. However, there are still some capitalists who only simply demand wage cuts and layoffs, and have not realized that improving management is the fundamental way to overcome difficulties and strive for development. Some capitalists regard labor-management consultation meetings as temporary emergency organizations, so there are no fixed organizational rules, formal consultation procedures, or meeting schedules.

### 武汉私营工厂商店中陆续建立劳资协商会议

　　武汉私营工厂商店中陆续建立劳资协商会议
    【本报讯】据新华社汉口讯：武汉市私营工商业中的纺织、布匹、印刷等十余行业和申新纱厂、怡和布店等三十多家工厂、商店，已自三月下旬陆续建立了劳资协商会议。各业协商会议的主要内容都是如何积极设法改善经营和提高生产。如申新纱厂第一次协议的二十八条中，有二十六条都是关于改进机器设备、改革管理制度、加强生产计划性、建立奖惩考核委员会、节约原料、减少浪费、提高产品数量和质量等问题。这些协议现已开始付诸实行。此外在改变某些工作方法以提高纱的质量方面也取得了某些协议。对于急待解决的关于女工生育和工人治病等问题，也根据具体情况，获得了适当的解决。
    在目前困难较大的卷烟、肥皂、火柴、面粉等业的劳资协商会议中，协商内容主要是节约开支，降低成本，以便维持生产，度过困难。
    在协商中由于不少企业的劳方以适当减低待遇，建议资方改善经营等方式，主动地协助资方克服困难，使某些资本家的顾虑已逐渐打消，提高了经营的积极性。如布匹业华申、协成、久大资方共增资二百八十匹布，共同维持营业。但也还有某些资本家只单纯要求减薪、解雇等，而未认识到改善经营才是克服困难争取发展的根本办法。有些资本家把劳资协商会议认作临时应急组织，因此没有一定的组织规则、正规的协商程序和会期等。
