Korea - Our Motherland
    Park Tae-hoon, Dean of the Geography Department, Kim Il-sung University, Korea
    On the eastern coast of the Asian continent, between the geographical coordinates of 124 degrees, 11 minutes, 3 seconds east longitude and 130 degrees, 56 minutes, 10 seconds east longitude, and 33 degrees, 6 minutes, 35 seconds north latitude and 43 degrees, 0 minutes, 30 seconds north latitude, lies a mountainous peninsula stretching 825 kilometers from north to south and 354 kilometers from east to west. This is the Korean Peninsula, where our people have lived for more than three thousand years.
    The Korean Peninsula is surrounded by sea on three sides: the Yellow Sea to the west, the Sea of Japan (or East Sea) to the east, and the Korea Strait to the south, separating it from the Japanese archipelago. The peninsula's coastline stretches for 9,000 kilometers. On the northern side, where the peninsula is separated from the mainland, there are two rivers—the Yalu River and the Tumen River—flowing in opposite directions. Both rivers originate from Mount Paektu, and many of our past glories are associated with this mountain range. This is a dormant volcano reaching 2,744 meters in height, with a large crater lake, Heaven Lake, at its summit. To compatriots who left their homeland during the period of foreign oppression, Mount Paektu is often a symbol of Korea. The heroic activities of the guerrillas under the leadership of Kim Il-sung have made Mount Paektu a symbol of the Korean people's armed struggle against the Japanese occupiers.
    The Yalu and Tumen Rivers, along Mount Paektu, form the continental boundary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where it shares a 16-kilometer border with the Soviet Union.
    Korea's area is 220,740 square kilometers, which is one percent of the area of the Soviet Union.
    According to 1942 statistics, the population of Korea was 26.3 million, of which 97 percent were Koreans.
    In the years since the expulsion of the Japanese invaders, the population of Korea has increased by more than one million, mainly due to the return of Koreans and expatriates who were forcibly relocated by the Japanese. The population of Korea now exceeds 27 million.
    The population is mainly concentrated in coastal areas and river basins, where there are about 200 residents per square kilometer. In the mountainous areas of northern Korea, there are only 20 residents per square kilometer. The national average is 123 people per square kilometer.
    Mountains, which are an inexhaustible treasure trove of mineral resources for our country, account for 75 percent of Korea's total area. At first glance, the mountain ranges seem intricately overlapping, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that all the mountain ranges have a tendency to descend southward.
    The mountain system begins in the north with the Changbai Mountains, extending from east to west to Mount Paektu. From Mount Paektu to the East Sea is the Machonryong Range, which separates North Hamgyong Province from South Hamgyong Province. Parallel to this mountain is the dormant volcanic mountain range of Mount Paektu. Next, in the southwest, it separates from the Machonryong Range, and further south is the Pujonryong Range. This mountain intersects with the Nangnim Mountains, which extend from north to south along the line separating the eastern and western provinces.
    The Machonryong, Pujonryong, and Nangnim Mountains form the highest plateau in Korea—the Kaema Plateau, with an average altitude of over 2,000 meters. From the Nangnim Mountains to the west coast of the Yellow Sea extends the Yalu River Plateau, which occupies a large area and is formed by numerous peaks and plateaus. The Nangnim Mountains gradually descend in the Yonghung Bay area where Hamhung and Wonsan Port are located, then rise again and turn into the Taebaek Mountains, which extend along the Sea of Japan coast to Busan for 454 kilometers.
    Near the beginning of this mountain range is Mount Kumgang, which is famous for its beautiful scenery. In the past, these mountains attracted many leisurely tourists from all bourgeois countries, but now this area has become a resort, sanatorium, and rest home area for our working people. The Taebaek Mountains themselves have become a base for the guerrilla movement in South Korea from Mount Kumgang southward. The eastern slope of the Taebaek Mountains is a sheer cliff, extremely precipitous, while the western side of the peaks has many not-very-high branches that descend smoothly towards the sea.
    Although there are many mountain ranges, the average altitude of the Korean Peninsula is 482 meters, much lower than the continental average of 825 meters. This is because most of the mountain ranges are not high, due to long-term erosion processes.
    The Korean Peninsula is geologically very old and mainly composed of ancient rocks: mica schist, gneiss, and granite account for most of Korea's area. Thick sedimentary layers exist in many areas. The most intense development of the Tertiary Period can be seen in the Huining, Myongchon, Kilju, Sinanju, and Pohang areas. The Tertiary Period has lignite seams and marine limestone layers. There are also Tertiary strata along river basins and lowlands.
    Mount Paektu, Ulleungdo Island, and Jeju Island were formed as a result of volcanic eruptions in the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. There are no active volcanoes or earthquakes in Korea now.
    Apart from Tertiary lignite, Korea has abundant anthracite coal seams, which belong to the Upper Permian period. The coalfield in the Pyongyang city area belongs to this period. Anthracite coal is world-renowned for its quality, and abundant graphite is also well-known. Korea's magnesite reserves rank first in the world, totaling 3.65 billion tons. In ancient rocks, there are also iron, gold, tungsten, molybdenum, nickel, and other non-ferrous and precious metals. There are 200 kinds of useful minerals and ores in Korea's mineral deposits.
    Lowlands occupy less area than mountains, but they are the densely populated and inhabited areas of the Korean Peninsula. The fertile plains that form the basis of our country's agricultural area are precisely in these river basins and coastal areas.
    The widest lowlands are in the western part of the peninsula along the Yellow Sea coast. Among them, the lowlands along the Taedong River and the Han River have relatively flat terrain. But most are smaller basins that undulate with hills. The southeastern river lowlands often occupy a small area and are located at the mouths and deltas of rivers.
    Most of the rivers in Korea are no more than 200 kilometers long; but there are six rivers except that, namely the Yalu River, the Tumen River, the Taedong River, the Han River, the Geum River, and the Nakdong River, whose lengths exceed 400 kilometers. Rivers often breach their banks during the rainy season, and the periods of mountain floods are very long, making them an inexhaustible source of potential for hydroelectric power stations. The largest hydroelectric power station in the Far East is located on the middle reaches of the Yalu River near Shuifeng City.
    The rivers flowing into the Yellow Sea become navigable rivers in their lower reaches, and fertile fields are scattered along the river basins.
    However, the Yellow Sea coast is subject to storm surges of up to ten meters, with seawater surging back, and large areas are permanently muddy. If they are to be utilized, significant engineering work is required. Now, high tides can be used for salt production.
    The eastern coast is the opposite; the tides are very weak, rarely reaching 80 centimeters high. The coast of the Sea of Japan is relatively flat, in contrast to the sheer cliff coasts of the western and southern parts of the peninsula, which is the result of the gradual decline of the main trunk of the mountain range towards the coast. Here, the sea is 3,000 meters deep, while the Yellow Sea and the Korea Strait are less than 150 meters deep.
    This is one of the most characteristic fundamental differences in our country. These differences, in turn, give rise to many smaller differences and complex changes in the natural world of Korea.
    Although Korea is surrounded by sea on three sides, its climate, except for the southern coastal areas, is continental. This is mainly because the Yellow Sea is not very deep, and ocean currents can quickly warm and cool, making it difficult to harmonize the national climate.
    Temperatures vary greatly across Korea, gradually decreasing from south to north. The average annual temperature in the northern border area is about 3 to 4 degrees Celsius above zero, the average temperature in central Korea reaches 10 degrees above zero, and the south reaches 14 degrees. The eastern coastal areas have less temperature variation than the western coastal areas. Generally speaking, summer temperatures do not differ significantly across regions, but in winter, the entire peninsula can be divided horizontally into 14 zones, with a temperature difference of 2 degrees in each zone.
    The Korean climate is extremely monotonous, with alternating warm and cold weather every three or four days. This climate is formed under the influence of two opposing air currents: the air current from Siberia to the Pacific Ocean, and the equatorial oceanic air current from the south to Mongolia. The former brings cold weather to Korea, while the latter brings rain. The average annual rainfall in Korea is 1,000 millimeters, of which 70 percent is summer rainfall.
    The Korean Peninsula has a very special geographical situation, with an unusual terrain, and climate conditions vary due to the influence of air and ocean currents, resulting in significant differences in the natural environment. In Korea, there are impassable dense forests, rugged peaks, torrents, thriving subtropical evergreen plants, fertile rice paddies, and lush orchards.
    Our peninsula is a bridge between the continental forms of Manchuria and North China, and the island forms of Japan, in terms of soil, flora, and fauna. Northern Korea has boreal forests, central Korea has temperate forests, and southern Korea and its islands have subtropical forests. There are over 900 different species of trees in our country, the most common of which are: Korean pine and Siberian pine, fir, Tungusian larch, various pine trees, Korean cedar, mountain ash (Salicaceae), willow, poplar, oak, Albizia julibrissin; rarer are: birch, ash, elm, alder, hornbeam, maple, cork oak, wild cherry, sumac, locust, horse chestnut, growing edible sweet berry Koyamaki and others.
    The total number of plants reaches about 3,500 species.
    The fauna of Korea is similar to that of Siberia and North China, but it also has purely Korean characteristics. Among the animals are: tiger, bear, wild boar, leopard, lynx, deer, roe deer, antelope, goat, rabbit, wolf, fox, badger, and others. There are over a thousand species of animals, and there are also many species of wild birds.
    The flora in the coastal and riverine areas of Korea is extremely lush, and there are many marine animals and fish, among which the following are of great importance in industry: sardine, mackerel, chub mackerel, cod, salmon, flounder, herring. In addition, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks, seaweed, and other edible algae are of great significance to the food of the residents.
    From this it can be seen that although our country's area is not large, it has such abundant resources and complex natural conditions, which gives us hope that the establishment of a comprehensive and sufficiently strong economy in the near future can be realized. Under a democratic system, this economy can guarantee a high standard of material life for the Korean people.
    Korea is an agricultural country. 65 percent of the residents are engaged in agriculture.
    Our main crops are: rice, millet, corn, soybeans, wheat, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, cultivated ginseng, fruits (mainly apples, pears), chestnuts, etc. All farming families raise cattle, horses, pigs, chickens, etc. In addition, farmers in many places also raise silkworms.
    Two percent of the residents in coastal areas are engaged in fishing and marine industries. The total value of products in this area accounts for about 5 percent of the total value of the national economy.
    The metallurgical industry in Korea is relatively developed. Mining, chemical industry, electricity, and textile industry are also developed.
    The total annual electricity generation is over 3 billion kilowatt-hours. Almost all electricity is supplied by hydroelectric power stations, most of which are concentrated in northern Korea.
    There are dozens of ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industries in North Korea. Tens of thousands of tons of iron, tungsten, zinc, lead, aluminum, molybdenum, and others are smelted. Graphite and magnesite are currently produced in small quantities.
    The chemical industry produces millions of tons of mineral fertilizers, soap, alcohol, and other chemical products annually. In addition, over 200,000 tons of salt are produced from seawater.
    Korea harvests 2.5 million cubic meters of timber annually. The main timber harvesting areas are the Yalu River, Tumen River, and Taedong River basins.
    The total length of Korean railways is 6,500 kilometers, which is still not enough for our country. In 1940, the total length of motor roads and cart roads was 53,000 kilometers. In addition, inland river transport and coastal shipping also play a huge role.
    The main ports on the western and southern coasts are: Nampo, Haeju, Incheon, Gunsan, Mokpo, Busan. The main ports on the eastern coast are: Wonsan, Hungnam, Seongjin, Chongjin, etc.
    The great role played by the Soviet army in our country's foundation of development on the basis of people's democratic principles is indescribable. The boundless assistance of the Soviet army has enabled North Korea to implement various democratic reforms.
    The implementation of land reform has greatly promoted the development of our country's agriculture. Farmers are enthusiastically engaged in peaceful labor: expanding cultivated areas, improving irrigation facilities, improving intensive land management, increasing livestock numbers, developing household handicrafts, and infrastructure construction.
    The transfer of all industrial enterprises to the Korean people, the subsequent large-scale nationalization of industries, and, most importantly, the active assistance of the Soviet Union in restoring construction, factory equipment, and railway transportation destroyed by the Japanese, have enabled the entire economy of northern Korea to successfully complete the national economic plan.
    However, the whole of Korea has not yet participated in economic construction, nor in the establishment of the material foundation of a new democratic society.
    American imperialists are now slaughtering our country's south.
    The American aggressors stop at no means, methods and ways in order to realize their despicable purposes. They dismantled factories and buried factory equipment underground. They strangled agriculture, throwing rotten food – flour, potatoes, corn, and surplus materials that American merchants could not sell – into the market. They used their political puppets – a handful of traitors – to enslave and plunder South Korea. They encouraged their hired dogs to commit unbridled acts of inhumane torture and massacres, attempting to suppress the people's protests against the looting of Korean wealth with bloody terror.
    American imperialism cannot turn back the clock of history. The day is not far off when the Korean people, with the support of democratic forces around the world, will recover South Korea and the nation's wealth, and the people will engage in the construction of a new and happy life with all their labor, and every working person will become the master of the country.

　　朝鲜——我们的祖国
    朝鲜金日成大学地理学部长  朴泰熏
    在亚洲大陆东部海岸上，在东经一二四度十一分三秒和一三○度五十六分一十秒与北纬三十三度六分三十五秒和四十三度零分三十秒的地理方位间，绵延着一个南北长八二五公里、东西阔三五四公里的山岳纵横的半岛。这就是朝鲜半岛，我们的民族在这里栖息已经三千多年了。
    朝鲜半岛三面临海：西为黄海、东为日本海或东海、南以朝鲜海峡与日本三岛相隔。半岛海岸线达九千公里。在半岛和大陆隔离的北部，有两条河流——鸭绿江和图们江，依相反的方向流动，这两条河流都是发源于白头山，我国过去的许多光荣，都是和这个山脉有联系的。这是一个高达二、七四四公尺的死火山，在火山的喷口上有一个大湖天池。在外国压迫时期离开祖国的同胞们看来，白头山常是朝鲜的象征；游击队在金日成领导下的英勇活动，使白头山成为朝鲜人民反日本占领者武装斗争的象征。
    沿白头山的鸭绿江和图们江，就是朝鲜共和国的大陆疆界，这里它和苏联具有长达十六公里的共同疆界。
    朝鲜的面积为二二○·七四○平方公里，等于苏联面积百分之一。
    根据一九四二年统计，朝鲜人口为二千六百三十万人，其中有百分之九七是朝鲜族人。
    日寇被逐后几年来，朝鲜人口增加了一百万以上，主要的是由于受日寇强迫移居的侨民和朝鲜人重返祖国的缘故。现在朝鲜人口数，已超过二千七百万人。
    人口主要集中于海岸地区与河流盆地，那里每一平方公里约有二百居民。朝鲜北部山岳地区，每一平方公里只有二十个居民。全国平均每一平方公里内，有一百二十三人。
    成为我国矿源无尽宝藏的山地占朝鲜全国面积百分之七十五。乍看地图好像山脉是错综交叠的，但是如果仔细观察，就会晓得全部山脉有一种向南低下的趋势。
    山脉的系统在北方从长白山脉开始，从东向西延伸到白头山。从白头山到东海有摩天岭，这个山把咸镜北道和咸镜南道分开。和这个山平行的，有白头山的死火山山脉。其次在西南方面和摩天岭就分开了，而再靠南一些，有赴战岭山。这个山和狼林山脉交叉，狼林山沿东部各道与西部各道分离之线，而由北向南延伸。
    摩天岭、赴战岭和狼林诸山脉形成朝鲜最高的高原——盖马高原，它的平均高度超过二千公尺。从狼林山到黄海岸的西部，延伸着鸭绿江高原，它占据着很大的面积，并且是由多数山峰和高原形成的。狼林山脉在咸兴和元山港所在的永兴湾地区逐渐低下，然后重新突起，并转向太白山，而太白山沿日本海岸一直延伸到釜山达四五四公里。
    靠近这个山脉的起端，有金刚山，它是以风景美丽著称的。这些山脉在过去曾经吸引了一切资产阶级国家很多闲情逸致的游客，但是现在这里成为我国劳动人民避暑地、疗养所和休养院的地区了。而太白山本身从金刚山向南成为南朝鲜游击运动的根据地了。太白山向东倾斜是断崖悬壁，险峻无比的，而由山峰向西则有许多不算很高的支脉，向着海面平滑地低落下去。
    虽然有很多的山脉，但朝鲜半岛地面的平均高度，是四八二公尺，比大陆平均高度八二五公尺要低下的多了。这是因为大部分山脉是并不高的，是因为长期浸蚀过程的结果。
    朝鲜半岛在地质方面是很古的，并且主要的是由古代岩石组成的：云母状片岩、片麻岩、花岗岩占朝鲜大半的面积。在许多地区存在着很厚的沈淀层。在会宁、明川、吉州、新安州、浦项地区中，能够看到第三纪最强烈的发展。在第三纪中拥有褐煤层和海上石灰纪层。沿河盆地和低地，也有第三纪的地层。
    白头山，郁陵岛和济州岛是由第三纪和第四纪火山喷发的结果形成的。现在朝鲜没有活火山，也没有地震的现象。
    除开第三纪的褐炭外，朝鲜有丰富的无烟煤层，它是属于上二叠纪时代的。平壤城区的煤田即属于这个时期。无烟煤以其品质在全世界享有盛名，大量的石墨，也是著称的。朝鲜菱苦土矿的储藏量，占世界的第一位，共有三十六亿五千万吨。在古代岩石中还有铁、金、钨、钼、镍及其他有色金属和贵金属。朝鲜矿藏中共有二○○种有益的矿产和矿石。
    低地比山地占有的面积较少，但低地是朝鲜半岛人烟稠密和人民习居的地方。作为我国农业区基础的富饶平原，正是在这些沿河盆地和海岸地区。
    最广泛的低地在沿黄海岸的半岛西部。其中沿大同江和汉江的低地具有比较平坦的地面。但大多数是较小的盆地，随山陵而起伏的。东南沿河低地，往往占有的面积不大，而且位于河口和三角洲。
    朝鲜大多数河流的长度，不超过二百公里；但有六条河流除外，即鸭绿江、图们江、大同江、汉江、锦江、洛东江，它们的长度超过四○○公里。河流在雨季往往决口，而且暴发山洪的时期很长，使它们成为水力发电站无尽藏的潜在的泉源。远东最大水力发电站，就在水丰城边鸭绿江的中流上。
    注入黄海的诸河流，在其下流都成为便于航行的河流，而在沿河的盆地上，满布着肥沃的田野。
    但是，黄海沿岸当高达十公尺的海潮时期，就被海水汹涌倒灌，广大地区永远是泥泞不干的。如果要利用它们，须费很大的工程。现在海潮高涨时，可以利用来采盐了。
    东部海岸就是相反的，海潮很微弱，未必能达到八十公分高。日本海的海岸和半岛西部南部的悬崖绝壁海岸相反，而是比较平坦的，这是由于山脉的主干逐渐向海滨低下的结果。这里海水深达三、○○○公尺，而黄海和朝鲜海峡的深度，还不到一五○公尺。
    这是我国最具特征的基本差异之一。这些差异又产生了许多小的差异和朝鲜自然界的复杂变化。
    虽然朝鲜三面环海，可是它的气候，除了南部海岸地方以外，是大陆性的，这主要是因为黄海海水不太深，洋流能够迅速温暖和寒冷，不易使全国气候调和起来的原故。
    朝鲜各地气温极不平衡，从南部至北部逐渐降低。北部国境地区一年间的平均温度，约在零上三度至四度之间，朝鲜中部平均温度达零上十度，而南部则达十四度。东部海岸地方温度，比西部海岸地方，变化较少。一般地说来，各地夏季温度，并没有显著差别，但是，冬季则可将整个半岛横分为十四个地带，每一地带中的温度相差二度。
    朝鲜气候，是极不单调的，天气经常每隔三四天，就发生寒暖交替。这种气候，是在两个对立的气流影响之下形成的，即从西伯利亚到太平洋去的气流，和从南部到蒙古去的赤道海洋气流。前者给朝鲜带来寒冷，后者则带来阴雨。朝鲜每年平均降雨量为一千公厘，其中百分之七十，是夏季降雨量。
    朝鲜半岛地理形势极为特殊，地面起伏异常，气候条件因为气流和洋流的影响也不相同，因而自然环境也有显著的差异。在朝鲜有着无法通行的密林地带、峻峰、激流，繁荣滋长的亚热带常绿植物，肥沃的稻田和茂盛的果园。
    我们的半岛在土壤、植物和动物界方面，是大陆形态的满洲和华北、与岛屿形态的日本之间的桥梁。朝鲜北部有寒带森林，中部有温带森林，南部和各岛屿则有亚热带森林。在我国有九百多种不同的树木，其中最多的是：阿阳松和西伯利亚松、枞、通古斯落叶松、各种松树、朝鲜杉、山鸣树（杨柳科）、柳、杨、橡、白金合欢；比较稀少的是：桦、白腊树、榆、赤杨、鹅儿枥、槭、软木树、野樱、黄栌、槐、七叶树（天师栗）、生长能供食用的甜蜜浆果的观音杉及其他等。
    全部植物约达三千五百种。
    朝鲜的动物界，是和西伯利亚与华北相似的，但也有纯粹朝鲜式的特点。在动物中有：虎、熊、野猪、豹、山猫、鹿、狍鹿、羚羊、山羊、兔、狼、狐、獾及其他等。动物约在千种以上，野禽的种类也是很多的。
    在朝鲜海岸及河川地区的植物界极为繁茂，并有许多海水动物及鱼类，其中在工业方面具有重大意义的是：沙丁鱼、鲭、青花鱼、鳕、鲑、比目鱼、鲱。此外，对于居民食品具有巨大意义的是甲壳类，棘皮动物，软体动物，以及海带和其他能供食用的海藻等。
    由此可见，我国面积虽然不大，可是有着这样丰富的物产和复杂的自然条件，这就使我们在不久的将来即可建立全面发展的和足够强大的经济之希望能够实现，这种经济在民主制度之下，是能保证朝鲜人民物质生活的高度水平的。
    朝鲜是农业国。居民百分之六十五从事农业。
    我国主要的农作物是：稻米、小米、玉蜀黍、大豆、小麦、马铃薯、棉花、烟草、人工栽培的人参、果品（主要是苹果、梨）、栗子等。在一切农民家庭中，都饲养牛、马、猪、鸡等。此外，许多地方的农民还养蚕。
    各沿海地区的居民百分之二，是从事渔业和海产业的，在这一方面的产品总值，约达国家经济产品总值的百分之五。
    朝鲜冶金业，是比较发达的。矿业、化学工业、电力和纺织业，也很发达。
    每年总发电量，在三十亿基罗瓦特小时以上。几乎全部电力是由水电站供给的，水电站的大部分集中在我国北部。
    在北鲜有数十处黑色金属及有色金属的冶金业。熔铸数万吨的铁、钨、锌、铅、铝、钼、及其他。石墨和菱苦土矿现在出产得还很少。
    化学工业每年出产矿物性肥料、肥皂、酒精及其他化学产品数百万吨。此外，从海水中产盐二十万吨以上。
    朝鲜每年采伐木材二百五十万立方公尺。主要的采伐木材地区，是鸭绿江、图们江和大同江流域。
    朝鲜铁路总长度，是六千五百公里，对于我国说来，这还是不够的。一九四○年汽车路和马车路的总长度，是五万三千公里。此外，内河运输和近海航行的运输，也起着巨大作用。
    西部和南部沿岸的主要港口是：南浦、海州、仁川、群山、木浦、釜山、东部沿岸的主要港口是：元山、兴南、城津、清津等。
    苏维埃军队对于我国，以人民民主原则建立发展的基础的事业中所起的伟大作用，是无法描绘出来的。苏维埃军队的无限的协助，使北朝鲜能够实现各种民主改革。
    土地改革的实行，大力地推动了我国农业的发展。农民热心地从事和平的劳动：扩充耕种面积，改善灌溉设备、提高对于土地的集约经营、增加家畜头数、发展家庭手工业和基本建设。
    一切工业企业之归为朝鲜人民所有，和在此以后实行的大规模工业的国有化，以及最主要的是苏联在恢复经日本人所破坏的建设、工厂设备与铁路运输方面的积极援助，使得我国北部的整个经济能够顺利完成国民经济计划。
    但是，整个朝鲜还没有参加经济建设、没有参加新民主主义社会物质基础的建立。
    美国帝国主义者现在宰割着我国南部。
    美国侵略者为了实现其卑鄙的目的，是不惜一切手段、方法和方式的。他们拆走了工厂，把工厂设备埋在地下。他们绞杀了农业，把腐坏了的食品——面粉、马铃薯、玉蜀黍以及美国商人卖不出去的剩余物资投到市场来。他们利用自己的政治傀儡——一小撮的卖国贼，来奴役和掠夺南鲜，他们鼓舞着自己的雇佣走狗们肆无忌惮地去作惨无人道的拷打和大批屠杀，企图用血腥的恐怖手段来镇压人民反对掠夺朝鲜财富的抗议。
    美国帝国主义，是不能使历史倒转的。朝鲜人民在全世界民主力量支援之下，去收复南鲜和全国富源，人民以其全部劳动力从事新的幸福生活的建设事业，每一个劳动人民都要成为国家主人的那一天已经不远了。（郭从周、南致善译自《新朝鲜》）
