　　Turning Hatred into a Source of Strength
　　——Old Worker Wang Wenbin Talks About Opposing American Aggression
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Hong
　　Comrade Wang Wenbin is an old worker with more than twenty years of experience. After the liberation of Beijing, he became the deputy director of the Shijingshan Power Plant and was honorably elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee. In the long years past, he personally suffered the pain of being a subjugated slave and profoundly understood the countless disasters brought to the people by the Kuomintang's brutal rule. He understands best why the Chinese people must continue to oppose American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and sympathize with and support the Korean people's just war of liberation.

　　Long before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Wang Wenbin harbored deep hatred for the imperialists, and he quickly participated in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

　　After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang army fled without a fight, and the Japanese soldiers came to the Shijingshan Power Plant.

　　"Your life must have been even harder then, right? How did the Japanese soldiers treat the workers?" the reporter asked him.

　　At the mention of the tragic experiences of the workers during this period, Comrade Wang Wenbin's eyes immediately flashed with hatred, and a look of pain appeared on his face. Because many of the past events that left a deep impression on his mind were now reappearing before his eyes. He recounted to the reporter the bloody facts of the Japanese invaders' persecution of the Chinese people.

　　He said: "Once, Japanese soldiers bought a group of Chinese workers from Tianqiao and made them do all kinds of hard labor in the Shijingshan area. These workers lived a very hard life. Each person could only eat a few very rough corn buns a day, and at night they were locked in cold and damp bunkers. Unable to endure such abuse by the enemy, many people ran away. But unfortunately, they did not escape far before they were discovered by the Japanese soldiers. Under the pursuit of the Japanese soldiers, many people were shot dead on the spot; the other few who were caught back suffered all kinds of torture.

　　"Another time, I saw with my own eyes that the Japanese soldiers forced the power plant workers to work in the hot water pool (it should have been after the water cooled down). Several workers fainted on the spot from the scalding. But the Japanese soldiers said that they were pretending, that they were deliberately being lazy, so these injured workers were brutally beaten again."

　　Under such cruel persecution by the enemy, it was very difficult for the workers to maintain their livelihood. Comrade Wang Wenbin said that he was the highest paid worker in the power plant at the time, but he still could not support his family, let alone the situation of ordinary workers. At that time, it was very common to see the corpses of people who had starved to death on the roads or in the mountains.

　　At this point, the reporter asked him this question: "Comrade Wang Wenbin, for many years you have personally suffered the pain inflicted on the Chinese people by the imperialists, and you have carried out a heroic struggle against the enemy for a long time. So, what are your views on the American imperialists' further aggression against our territory of Taiwan and armed interference in the internal affairs of Korea today?"

　　"Isn't the matter very clear?!" He immediately replied in a firm tone: "After the victory of the War of Resistance, American imperialism supported Chiang Kai-shek in launching a counter-revolutionary civil war. I don't know how many innocent compatriots died under American-made planes and cannons. Take Beijing as an example, I know clearly: American soldiers raped female students of Peking University; American soldiers' jeeps ran over and killed Chinese lawyers; and even when they practiced shooting in the suburbs, they deliberately shot and killed several Chinese children. Countless facts have proven that American imperialism is the greatest enemy of the Chinese people today. Its greed and brutality are no less than those of the Japanese bandits.

　　"Undoubtedly, the Chinese people, especially the Chinese working class, will protect the fruits of our victory at all times, just like protecting their own eyes. Although today, Taiwan and other islands are still in the hands of the enemy, we have enough strength and firm confidence to liberate all the unliberated territories, and we are not afraid of any obstruction from the American imperialists. Similarly, for the Korean people's just cause of liberation, the people of China, who were once colonies and semi-colonies, not only sympathize deeply but are also willing to fully support it."

　　Finally, Comrade Wang Wenbin said indignantly: "For many years, the two great nations of China and Korea have lived the same humiliating life of slaves. We should turn our hatred for American imperialism into the source of our strength. When we recall the pain we suffered in the past, we should be determined to build a new people's country with all our strength and thwart any aggression by the enemy!"

　　把仇恨变成力量的泉源
    ——老工人王文彬谈反对美国侵略
    本报记者  林洪
    王文彬同志，是一个有二十几年工龄的老工人。北京解放后，他当了石景山发电厂的副厂长，又光荣地被选为北京市人民政府委员会的委员。在过去漫长的岁月里，他亲身遭受过当亡国奴的痛苦，也深刻地领会了国民党的残酷统治给人民带来的无数灾难。他是最懂得中国人民为什么要继续反对美帝侵略台湾，同情并支持朝鲜人民的正义的解放战争的。
    远在抗战以前，王文彬同志对于帝国主义者，就怀着很深的仇恨，而且很快地，他也参加了反对帝国主义和国民党反动统治的革命斗争。
    抗日战争爆发后，国民党军队不战而逃，日本兵来到了石景山发电厂。
    “你们那时的生活一定更苦吧？日本兵怎样对待工人？”记者这样问他。
    一提起这一时期工人兄弟们悲惨的遭遇，王文彬同志的眼中立刻闪耀起仇恨的光芒，脸上出现了痛苦的表情。因为许多在他脑海中印象很深的往事，这时都浮现在他的眼前了。他滔滔不绝地向记者追述了日本侵略者残害中国人民的血腥的事实。
    他说：“有一次，日本兵从天桥买来了一批中国工人，在石景山一带作着各种各样的苦工。这些工人的生活非常苦，每人一天只能吃到几个非常粗糙的窝窝头，夜里被关在阴冷潮湿的碉堡里。因为受不了敌人这样的虐待，有许人逃跑了。但不幸，他们逃出不远，就被日本兵发现了。在日本兵的追赶下，当场有许多人就被开枪打死；另外几个被抓回来的人，便受尽了各种酷刑。
    “还有一次，我亲眼看见，日本兵强迫发电厂的工人到热水池中工作（应该是水冷了再下去的）。当场就有几个工人被烫得昏了过去。但日本兵还说他们是装假，是故意怠工，于是这几个受伤的工人，又被他们狠毒地打了一顿。”
    在敌人这样残酷的迫害下，工人要维持生活是非常困难的。王文彬同志说，他当时是发电厂中工资最高的，但仍然不能维持全家人的生活，至于一般工人的情形那就更不用提了。那时，在路上或山野里，饿死的人的尸体是很常见的。
    谈到这里，记者向他提出了这样一个问题：“王文彬同志，多少年来你亲身遭受了帝国主义者所加于中国人民的痛苦，而且长期同敌人进行了英勇的斗争。那么，你对于美帝国主义今天进一步侵略我国领土台湾，和武装干涉朝鲜内政，有些什么看法？”
    “事情不是很明白吗？！”他立刻用坚定的口气回答说：“抗战胜利后，美国帝国主义支持蒋介石发动了反人民的内战。不知道有多少善良的同胞，死在美制的飞机、大炮之下。就拿北京来说，我清楚地知道：美国兵强奸过北大的女学生；美国兵的吉普车压死过中国的律师；甚至他们在郊外打靶，还故意打死了好几个中国孩子。无数的事实已经证明：美国帝国主义是今天中国人民的最大的敌人。它贪婪和残暴的程度，并不亚于日本强盗。
    “无疑地，中国人民，特别是中国的工人阶级，无论在什么时候，都会像保护自己的眼睛一样，来保护我们的胜利果实的。虽然，今天台湾等岛屿还在敌人手里，但是，我们有足够的力量和坚强的信心，去解放一切尚未解放的国土，不怕美帝的任何阻挠。同样地，对于朝鲜人民正义的解放事业，曾经是殖民地和半殖民地中国的人民，不但十分同情，而且愿意全力予以支持。”
    最后，王文彬同志愤慨地说：“多少年来，中朝两大民族同样过着屈辱的奴隶生活。我们应当把对美国帝国主义的仇恨，变成我们力量的泉源。当我们回忆到过去所受的痛苦时，就应该决心全力去建设新兴的人民的国家，挫败敌人的任何侵略！”
