        I. Amorpha fruticosa (Bastard Indigo, False Indigo-bush)
    Amorpha fruticosa is a drought-resistant and alkali-tolerant small tree (shrub) that grows long branches suitable for green manure and soil improvement. Its leaves resemble locust trees, it blooms with purple flowers, and it bears small, fragrant, brown pods. It can grow in dry, barren sandy soil, serving as a low-level forest in windbreaks, with the functions of fixing sand, blocking wind, accumulating dust, and improving soil quality. Its roots are fine and do not spread around. Furthermore, it can develop root nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Planting it on field edges, roadside edges, ditch banks, and rice paddy ridges can fertilize the land without the disadvantage of competing with crops for nutrients. Its decayed roots and fallen leaves turn into fertilizer in the soil, gradually transforming lean land into fertile land. It is also alkali-tolerant; its branches and leaves can absorb saline-alkali substances, and after rotting and fermenting, they can neutralize the saline-alkali content, thus improving alkaline soil. Its branches are uniformly thick and can be used to weave various utensils, making it widely useful. In the past, the Japanese extensively promoted it in the Northeast as a raw material for dozens of handicrafts.
    Methods of afforestation during the rainy season: Cuttings, seedlings, or direct sowing (not for alkaline land) are all possible. Use last year's or this year's branches, selecting strong ones and cutting them into lengths of just over a foot, planting them in clusters in pits or inserting them into holes (like planting willow trees). For seedling cultivation, choose good soil and plow and rake the land well. Then, use a plow to create long furrows about a foot apart; water the furrows thoroughly. After it has dried slightly, mix the seeds, which have been soaked in cool water for four days beforehand, with grass ash and sow them into the furrows. Then cover with soil and smooth it out, using five to six pounds of seeds per acre. After smoothing, cover with soil about half an inch thick. There is no need to water again, and seedlings will emerge in a few days. When the seedlings have grown for a full year, transplant them to dry sandy land during the rainy season, and they will easily survive. In sandy soil of better quality, direct sowing can be used for afforestation. During heavy rain, soak the seeds in warm water (two parts boiling, one part cold), and after 24 hours, take them out and place them in a reed basket or other container. Treat them like sprouting bean sprouts, placing them in a warm place and rinsing them with warm water every day. When they are about to sprout, sow them in the field with a seed drill, smooth it out, and cover with soil about half an inch thick. They will sprout in three to five days. (Planting in clusters in pits is also possible).
    After planting for two years, cut the branches once a year. Each acre can yield two to three thousand pounds of branches, four to seven feet long, with uniform thickness at both ends. They can be used for weaving baskets, hampers, cages, crates, suitcases, clothes racks, bookshelves, door curtains, tables, etc. They can also be used for papermaking. The seeds can be used to make medicine, and the branches and leaves can be used to make compost. According to years of experiments conducted by the Junliangcheng Experimental Farm of the Bohai Reclamation Bureau (in paddy fields), applying 600 pounds of semi-dry branches and leaves of Amorpha fruticosa is equivalent to applying 100 pounds of soybean cake or 30 pounds of ammonium sulfate in terms of fertilizer effect. In actual application, use 600 to 800 pounds per acre (equivalent to replacing 100 to 140 pounds of soybean cake) as base fertilizer, and then add fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer in appropriate amounts depending on the growth situation. When used as base fertilizer, the branches and leaves of Amorpha fruticosa should be cut down, chopped into pieces, and scattered into the field, then turned into the soil with a plow or iron shovel, or trampled into the mud.
            II. Lespedeza bicolor (Shrubby Bushclover)
    Lespedeza bicolor is also a drought-resistant, barren-resistant, alkali-tolerant small tree that can grow long branches, be used for green manure, and also be used as feed. Its flowers are purple (a good source of nectar), and its leaves are composed of three round leaflets. It naturally grows into forests on barren hillsides after forest destruction, gradually improving soil quality and restoring fertility. It is the most suitable pioneer tree species for afforestation by sowing on barren mountains in North China. In the northeastern part of Shanxi and the western mountains of Hebei, local people cut it down in bundles to use as feed. It is easy for cattle to gain weight when fed with it, making it a good livestock feed. Root nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria grow on the roots, which can increase nitrogen fertilizer in the soil. The root system is relatively small. Planting it by ponds, ditch banks, roadsides, well sides, field edges, graves, or other open spaces will not compete with crops for nutrients and can improve soil quality. Sowing and afforestation in sandy wasteland is very suitable for use as a low-level forest belt for windbreaks. The branches are soft and can be used to weave baskets, farm implements, etc. Sowing and afforestation in mountainous and sandy wasteland results in rapid and vigorous growth (according to the last rainy season's strip sowing experiment in the old Cihe sandy wasteland by the Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau, the roots were seven inches deep in the same year. This year's inspection showed that it was more than twice as tall as Amorpha fruticosa sown at the same time). Branches can be cut several times a year, which is most suitable for use as green manure. According to Japanese experiments, transplanting in the first year can yield 800 pounds of dry branches and leaves per acre in the second year and 1,000 pounds in the third year. The content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fresh Lespedeza bicolor branches and leaves is similar to that of fresh alfalfa or green peas, and the fertilizer effect is significant. At the same time, it can also improve alkaline land.
    The afforestation method is the same as that for Amorpha fruticosa. Sowing and afforestation during the rainy season on dry, barren mountains is most likely to succeed. It is advisable to soak the seeds in warm water during heavy rain. When the rain stops, the seeds will also be soaked through, and they should be sown immediately. They will germinate and emerge from the soil in three to five days.

　　介绍两种优良绿肥——
    紫穗槐和胡枝子的栽种法
    李霆
        一、紫穗槐（棉槐、鼬萩）
    紫穗槐是一种耐旱、耐碱，能长条子，压绿肥与改良土质的小树（灌木）。叶子象槐树，开紫花，结褐色带香味的小荚果。能生长在干瘠的沙地，作防风林带的低层林，有固沙、挡风、积存尘土与改良土质的功用。根细而不向周围扩展。并能长有根瘤菌，在地头、地边、道旁、渠边及水稻田的沟埂上种植，能肥地而没有“拔地”的缺点。它的朽根和落叶在土中变成肥料，能逐渐把瘦地变成肥地，还能耐碱，它的枝叶能吸收盐碱质，腐烂发酵后能使盐碱质中和，有改良碱土的作用。条子上下等粗能编各种器具，用途很广。过去日本人在东北大量推广，作为数十种手工业品的原料。
    雨季造林的方法：插条、育苗或直接播种（碱地不用）都可以。用去年或当年生的条子，选粗壮的切成一尺多长，挖坑丛植或穿孔插条（跟栽杞柳一样）。育苗要在好地，将地耕耙整理好以后，用犁挑成一尺来远的长沟；顺沟浇足了水，稍干后把预先在凉水里浸了四天的种籽拌草灰一同耩到沟里，再盖土擦平，每亩地用籽五斤到六斤，擦平后盖土半寸多厚，不用再浇水，几天就可出苗。生长满一年的苗趁伏雨移栽到干沙地里造林，极易成活。在土质较好的沙地，可直接播种造林。在下大雨的时候，把种籽先用两开一凉的温水浸过，经一昼夜再捞出来，装入席篓或其他容器内，跟生豆芽一样，放在温暖地方，每日用温水冲一次，到将出芽的时候，在地里用耧耩下、擦平、盖土半寸多厚，三几天就出芽。（挖坑丛播也可以）。
    种上满二年，每年割条一次，每亩可收条二、三千斤，条长四尺到七尺，两头等粗。供编筐、篮、篓、笼、提箱、衣架、书架、门帘、桌子等用，还可以造纸。种子可以制药，枝叶可以沤粪。据渤海区农垦管理局军粮城试验场历年试验（在水田）结果，施用紫穗槐半干枝叶六百斤，即等于施用豆饼一百斤或硫酸亚三十斤的肥效。在实际施用时，以每亩六百斤至八百斤（可代替豆饼一百斤至一百四十斤）用作基肥，再看生育情形酌量补充速效性氮素肥料。用作基肥时要将紫穗槐枝叶割下切碎撒到田内，用犁耠或铁锨翻入土中，或用脚踩入泥中都可以。
            二、胡枝子（萩、抗条、亨子）
    胡枝子也是一种耐干瘠、耐盐碱、能长条子、压绿肥并能作饲料的小树。花紫色（是一种很好的蜜源植物），叶子由三片圆形小叶片合成。在森林破坏以后的瘠薄山坡上野生成林，能逐渐改良土质，恢复地力，是华北荒山播种造林最适合的一种先锋树种。在山西东北部与冀西山地老乡都成捆的砍下作饲料，喂牛容易上膘，是一种很好的畜牧饲料。根上长有根瘤菌，能增加土中氮肥，根盘较小，在池塘、渠边、路旁、井边、地头、坟地或其他空地栽种，既不拔地，且能改良土质。在沙荒地播种造林，用作防风林的低层林带很合适。枝条细软，能编筐、篮、农具等。在山荒、沙荒地播种造林，生长迅速旺盛（据冀西沙荒造林局去年雨季在老磁河沙荒条播，当年扎根七寸来深，今年检查，比同时播种的紫穗槐高出一倍以上），每年可割条好几次，用来压绿肥最合适，据日本人试验，头年移栽，每亩地第二年可得干枝叶八百斤，第三年得一千斤，新鲜胡枝子枝叶，所含氮、磷、钾三要素含量与新鲜苜蓿或青豌豆相近，肥效很大，同时，还能改良碱地。
    造林方法和紫穗槐一样，干燥山荒地雨季播种造林，最易成功，宜趁大雨用温水浸种，雨住了，种籽也浸透了，马上播种，三几天即发芽出土。
