To the Editor:

Regarding the complaint made by Zhang Yisheng, a student at Harbin Medical University, published in the People's Daily on June 17th, alleging that Zhang Yicheng, the village finance and grain committee member of Yugou District, had seized his wife, we read it and immediately dispatched He Shou, the president of the People's Court, and discipline inspection committee members, a total of four people, to the area for investigation on three separate occasions. The Su Bei Inspection Committee and the Su Bei People's Court also sent people to conduct a joint investigation in the area. After more than ten days of repeated understanding, investigation, and research, it was proven that Zhang Yisheng's complaint was based on a misunderstanding. We now inform you of the truth of the matter.

The Course of Events

According to our understanding, Zhang Yisheng's family is a military family. However, it was once mistakenly registered as a martyr's family in the county and district records. The reason for this is that there was a Zhang Yimei in the village who joined the army with Zhang Yisheng and went to the Northeast. Zhang Yimei unfortunately died heroically in the Jinjiatun battle in February 1946. Last August, Zhang Yisheng sent a letter proving that Yimei had died. In January of this year (lunar calendar), Zhang Yimei's wife, Han Lanying, and her brother, Zhang Yijun, took the letter to the district to report for pension benefits. Xia, the district clerk, carelessly wrote Zhang Yimei as Zhang Yisheng because he saw that the letter of proof was written by Zhang Yisheng. Zhang Yisheng's elder brother, Yixiang, learned of this and rushed to Yugou town to ask them to correct it. District Chief Liu Yongnian personally corrected it, but the district government did not immediately report it to the county for correction. As for the claim that Zhang Yisheng's father went to the district to check the roster and found that his family had been changed to a martyr's family, and that he went to the county to negotiate to change the martyr's family to a military family but the county ignored him, this is not true.

Secondly, the claim of seizing his wife is also not true. Zhang Yisheng's wife is congenitally blind (she can only see a little in daylight) and is honest and sincere. She has been with the Zhang family for nine years. After Zhang Yisheng joined the army, she returned to her parents' home to live. Last July, her father passed away, and she returned home. On January 9th of this year (lunar calendar), she went to her second sister's house. Hearing that a certain division's comfort group was coming to Huaiyin to distribute relief grain, she borrowed a room from the wife of finance and grain committee member Zhang Yicheng for a few days, planning to return to her second sister's house after receiving the grain. Because she and Zhang Yicheng's family are close cousins, they allowed her to live there. She stayed at Zhang Yicheng's house for five days and four nights, and on the morning of the sixth day of the fourth lunar month, she went to her second sister's house. No improper behavior occurred during that time. But why did this misunderstanding occur? The main reason is that Zhang Yisheng's elder brother, Zhang Yixiang, had bad feelings towards village finance and grain committee member Zhang Yicheng in the past. This spring, when a certain division's comfort group came to Huaiyin to distribute relief grain, Zhang Yixiang brought his military family certificate to Huaiyin to collect grain early. But the comrades of the comfort group said, "Zhang Yisheng is no longer within the scope of this unit and cannot be issued." He then wrote a letter to the Civil Affairs Section of the county government, and the County Civil Affairs Section issued 30 jin of relief grain to him. After he returned, Zhang Yisheng's wife came to collect the grain again, and was also introduced to the County Civil Affairs Section by the comfort group. Section Member Ding said, "It has already been collected, the person who collected the grain just left!" Zhang Yisheng's wife returned empty-handed. On the way, she ran into Zhang Yixiang. She asked Zhang Yixiang how much grain he had collected, but Zhang Yixiang concealed it. The two sides started arguing. Zhang Yixiang pretended to scold Zhang Yicheng, saying that they should not have been made to run back and forth for nothing. After she got home, she told Zhang Yicheng about the grain collection. Zhang Yicheng was furious and told Zhang Yisheng's wife to firmly demand the grain from him. Zhang Yicheng's wife also had an argument with Zhang Yixiang's family. Zhang Yixiang did not give the grain. Zhang Yicheng then told Yisheng's wife to report to the township government. Zhang Yixiang was scolded by the township instructor and ordered to return the grain (only 18 jin were returned). Therefore, Zhang Yixiang harbored some resentment towards finance and grain officer Zhang Yicheng. On the other hand, he also wanted the troops to provide relief to him, so he wrote a letter to Zhang Yisheng, thus creating this misunderstanding (the specific situation can be proven by Zhang Yisheng's father, brother, and representatives of the masses).

Handling of the matter:

1.  Finance and grain committee member Zhang Yicheng has been made to conduct self-criticism and has been given criticism and education.

2.  Zhang Yisheng's elder brother, Zhang Yixiang, and father, Zhang Yugui, have been given education, and Zhang Yixiang has been made to write a self-criticism. The elderly Mr. Zhang Yugui wrote a reply to his son explaining the truth.

3.  At the mass meeting, the district clerk Xia and the township head, among others, conducted a review of the work related to preferential treatment for military families: that they had not provided adequate care for Zhang Yisheng's family and that their work was careless and did not involve careful inspection. This is one of the root causes of the dispute. In addition to having them publicly reflect at the mass meeting, they were given a demerit on the administrative level.

Our self-criticism:

After Zhang Yisheng's complaint was published, we felt that our work regarding preferential treatment for military families was done poorly. After the work was assigned, concrete and in-depth inspections were not sufficient. Sometimes, when problems were discovered below, they were not dealt with promptly. We will strive to improve these shortcomings in the future.

In order to clarify the facts and define responsibilities, please forward this matter to Comrade Zhang Yisheng, hoping that he will clarify it in the newspaper.

The publication of Comrade Zhang Yisheng's letter, although the facts do not conform, is of great help to our future work. In the future, we sincerely hope that comrades related to this county in all aspects of work, especially comrades in the military, can give us more opinions and criticisms to promote the improvement of our work.

### 张肄胜同志之妻并未被霸占  淮阴县政府来信报告详情

　　张肄胜同志之妻并未被霸占
    淮阴县政府来信报告详情编辑同志：
    人民日报六月十七日发表哈尔滨医大张肄胜申诉虞沟区村财粮委员张肄成霸占其妻一事，我们阅悉，即派人民法院院长何首及纪律检查委员等四人，先后三次前往该地进行检查。苏北检查委员会、苏北人民法院亦派人往该地共同进行检查，经十余天反复了解、调查研究结果，证明张肄胜的申诉是出于误会。兹将事情真象告诉你们。
    事情发生的经过
    根据了解，张肄胜家是军属。但在县区登记中曾一度错为烈属，其原因是该村有一个张肄美，以前同张肄胜同时参军随军往东北。张肄美不幸在一九四六年二月于金家屯战役中光荣牺牲。去年八月间，张肄胜来信证明肄美已牺牲。今年一月间（旧历）张肄美的老婆韩兰英及其哥张肄俊将信拿到区里报抚恤时，区里夏文书因见写证明信的是张肄胜，竟粗枝大叶的将张肄美错写为张肄胜。张肄胜的哥哥肄祥知道此事后，即赶往虞沟镇区里叫他们改正。区长刘永年即亲自拿笔改掉，但区政府未即时上报县里更正。至于所说张肄胜父亲到区里查名册，发现把他家改为烈属，到县交涉请把烈属改军属，县里不理睬，是不确实的。
    其次，所称霸占其妻一事，也不是事实。张肄胜的老婆是胎生瞎子（只能在白天看到一点东西），为人忠实老诚。她到张家已九年。张肄胜参军后，她即回娘家生活。去年七月她父亲去世，复又回家。今年一月九日（旧历）她到了她的二姐家。听说某师慰问团要来淮阴发救济粮，她即向财粮张肄成的女人借住几天，准备在领取粮食后再回到二姐家去。她和张肄成家因系亲堂兄弟，故允其居住。她于四月初二到张肄成家住了五天四宿，初六早上便到她二姐家去了。其间并未发生任何不良行为。但为什么会发生这个误会呢？主要是张肄胜的哥哥张肄祥同村财粮委员张肄成在过去感情不好。今年春天某师慰问团来淮阴发放救济粮时，张肄祥早将军属证拿来淮阴领粮。但慰问团同志说：“张肄胜现已不属该部范围，不能发给。”他即写信来县府民政科，由县民政科发给救济粮三十斤。他回去后，张肄胜的老婆又来领，亦经慰问团介绍到县民政科。丁科员说：“已领去了，领粮的人才走！”张肄胜的老婆遂空手回去了。在路上她碰到了张肄祥。她问张肄祥领了多少粮，张肄祥隐瞒不说。双方即起口角。张肄祥假装大骂张肄成不应该让他们来回空跑。她到家后即将领粮事告诉了张肄成。张肄成听后大怒，即叫张肄胜老婆坚决向他要粮，张肄成的女人又同张肄祥家吵了一场。张肄祥不给粮食。张肄成又叫肄胜的老婆去乡公所报告。张肄祥被乡指导员斥责了一番，并令其退回粮食（只退给十八斤）。因此张肄祥对财粮张肄成有些怀恨。另一方面，他亦想部队救济他，故写信给张肄胜，遂造成此一误会（其具体情形可由张肄胜的父亲、哥哥及群众代表证明）。
    对此事的处理：
    一、已让财粮委员张肄成进行了自我检讨，并给以批评教育。
    二、对张肄胜的哥哥张肄祥、父张玉贵则给予教育，并叫张肄祥写了检讨，张玉贵老先生给儿子写了回信，说明事实真相。
    三、在群众会上，由区夏文书、乡长等对优属工作做了检讨：对张肄胜家属照顾不周，工作粗枝大叶，不细心检查。这是发生纠纷的根源之一。除让他们在群众会上当众反省外，行政上并给以记过处分。
    我们的检讨
    我们从张肄胜的申诉信发表后，感觉我们的优属工作做得比较差。工作布置后，具体深入的检查也不够。下面发现了问题，有时也未能即时处理。这些缺点我们今后将努力改进。
    为了弄清事实，明确责任，此事情请转告张肄胜同志，希望他在报纸上予以申明。
    张肄胜同志信的发表，事实虽不符合，但对我们今后工作的帮助很大，今后敬希与本县有关的各方面工作同志尤其是在部队中同志们，能对我们多提意见，多加批评，以推动我们工作的改进。
