　　The Red Flag of Liberation Never Fell
　　Since 1925, the peasants of Fujian, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have participated in the liberation struggle. Representatives from Yongding, Shanghang, Longyan, Chong'an, Wuping, Changting, Fuqing, Putian, and other places who are participating in the Fujian Provincial Peasants' Congress will never forget the many years of association between the Communist Party and the peasants. Some peasants had met Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and in some places, under the twenty-plus years of bloody terror of the Kuomintang bandits, the red flag of the liberation struggle never fell. The peasants there felt unparalleled glory and pride in being able to be with the Communist Party forever.
　　Two of the representatives at this meeting were old peasant representatives in their sixties and old Communist Party members. One was Luo Zhufa, a representative from Yongding, who joined the Communist Party more than twenty years ago when he was forty years old. Before joining the Communist Party, he only knew that those who tilled the land were always unable to eat their fill, but he didn't know why. After enlightenment and education by comrades in the Party, he became aware. He understood class struggle, and then he knew, "Unite the toiling people to make revolution, overthrow the landlords to turn over a new leaf."
　　In 1927, he participated in the Yongding County Uprising, and in February 1928, he participated in attacking Hulei Town in Yongding County. On April 17 of the same year, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in a mighty march to Yongding. At that time, the Yongding County Revolutionary Committee was established. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De both attended the founding meeting, which was attended by thousands of people. Comrade Deng Zihui was also present. At that time, everyone elected Comrade Zhang Dingcheng as chairman, and Comrade Luo Zhufa was also a member of the committee. Later, he organized the people's armed forces to establish the Red Guards and persisted in the Yongding revolutionary struggle. When the Red Army began the Long March, the Kuomintang reactionaries searched for him very closely. He was once arrested and suffered severe torture by the enemy. His wife was frightened into insanity by being arrested and eventually died as a result. He said that he had always firmly believed in these years: "The Communist Party is for us workers and peasants, and the revolution will surely be victorious in Fujian, victorious in China, and victorious in the world!" Today, he finally sees this victory.
　　Persisting in Guerrilla Warfare
　　Comrade Chen Puchuan, 63, is a peasant representative from Putian. He was originally a poor peasant and participated in the revolution in 1924 and joined the Communist Party in 1926. Initially, because the reactionaries forced farmers to plant opium and levied heavy taxes regardless of whether they planted it or not, he organized farmers to oppose it and drove away the "county magistrate." Later, he led farmers to organize "Red Peasant Associations." Gradually, the members were armed and engaged in fierce struggles with the reactionaries. The peasants regarded them as saviors, leading the way and scouting for them. When the peasants there were bullied too much, they would come and ask them to save them. They persisted in guerrilla warfare. After 1948, they expanded to more than 2,000 guerrillas, preparing to join forces with the Liberation Army until Fujian was liberated. For more than twenty years, Comrade Chen Puchuan has always led the peasants in victorious struggles. He was wounded, but even now, he has not rested for a moment because of his age. After liberation, he immediately led the masses in rent reduction and anti-hegemony movements. Therefore, the masses trust him and believe that the Communist Party is always the savior of the peasants.
　　Four Generations of Grievances
　　"I have 'four generations of grievances.' If it weren't for the Communist Party, I would never be able to turn over."
　　Xiong Hailian, a peasant representative from Shunchang County, whose real name is Jie Guangli, recounted how his family had been killed by landlords and reactionary regimes for generations. As he spoke, he cried and choked with sobs.
　　He was originally from Linchuan, Jiangxi. His great-grandfather was buried alive by the landlord because he owed rent due to drought. His grandfather was arrested for owing rent and died in prison in the county government. His father was beaten to death on the spot by the landlord Jie Hua Ba's lackeys for owing rent. At that time, his eldest brother was twelve years old, his second brother was four years old, and he was only two years old. His mother carried him on her back and begged for seven years, suffering from cold and hunger. It was difficult even to eat some rice bran. When he was seven years old, he herded cattle for others. When he was thirteen years old, his mother died. Before her death, his mother told him about the hatred of three generations and urged him to avenge this deep blood feud.
　　However, under the dual oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries and landlords, how could he take revenge? Instead, he was oppressed so much that he could hardly survive. In order to eat, he still worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. When he was nineteen years old, the Jiang bandits conscripted soldiers, and his three brothers scattered. He himself bought a fake pass with the name "Xiong Hailian" and ran to Shaowu, Fujian, to work as a long-term laborer. Later, he rented fields to farm. In 1939, when half of the autumn harvest was done, the Jiang bandits came to conscript again. He abandoned everything and fled over the mountains to Shunchang. He suffered from hunger and cold until last May, when the guerrillas liberated Shunchang, and the Communist Party and the People's Government came, and he met his saviors for the first time. He knew the suffering of the peasant class deeply, so he actively served the peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party. Now he has been elected as a representative to attend the meeting in the "provincial capital." He, in this fourth generation, has truly turned over a new leaf.
　　He said: "Thank the Communist Party! I have finally turned over. Now I want to apply to change the fake name on my household registration back to my original name, Jie Guangli."
　　Peasants Cannot Be Separated from the Communist Party
　　After liberation, the worker-peasants, under the education of the Communist Party, are progressing rapidly. Huang Wanle, a young peasant representative, is a good example. He is only twenty-two years old this year. In the short few months since the liberation of Fuzhou, he has been elected as the director of the Dageng District Agricultural Preparation Committee and has participated in several district peasant congresses, municipal peasant congresses, and municipal people's representative conferences. This time, he also participated in the provincial peasant congress and gloriously participated in the presidium.
　　Before liberation, the landlord often forced his mother and him to pay rent and even threatened his mother with a gun; the local bully completely destroyed the crops in his field, but they did not dare to resist. After liberation, the landlords and local bullies dared not bully the peasants anymore. Dageng District also established its own peasant association, and he was elected as the director, leading the peasants to reduce rent, recovering more than 11,000 catties of grain; the reasoning struggle defeated the local bully Chen Guohang, opened up more than 150 mu of wasteland in the entire district, and repaired a dam; and organized everyone to apply more fertilizer and weed diligently to prepare for a good harvest this year. He said: "We peasants were afraid that we couldn't do these things before. We were able to do them well only with the help and education of the Communist Party and the People's Government. The kindness of the Communist Party is truly endless."

　　坚持斗争二十六年的福建农民
    解放红旗始终没有倒下
    从一九二五年起，福建的农民就在共产党的领导下参加了解放斗争。如此次参加福建省农代会的永定、上杭、龙岩、崇安、武平、长汀、福清、莆田……等地代表，他们都永远忘不了共产党和农民相处的许多岁月。有些农民曾见过毛主席、朱总司令，有的地方甚至在国民党匪帮二十多年的血腥恐怖下，解放斗争的红旗始终没有倒下过。那里的农民们，都因为能和共产党永久的在一起而感到无上的光荣和骄傲。
    这次会议上有两位六十几岁的老农民代表，老共产党员。一位是永定代表罗助发，二十几年前就加入共产党，那时他已四十岁。在参加共产党以前，他只知道下地耕田的人总是吃不饱肚子，但不知道为什么，经过党内同志启发教育后，他觉悟了，他认识了阶级斗争，于是他就知道：“团结劳苦的人闹革命，打倒地主好翻身。”
    一九二七年他参加了永定县的大暴动，一九二八年二月又参加攻打永定县的湖雷镇。同年四月十七日，毛主席、朱总司令带着中国工农红军浩浩荡荡开到永定来了，那时永定县成立革命委员会，在几千人的成立会上，毛主席和朱总司令都参加，邓子恢同志也在座，当时大家都推选张鼎丞同志为主席，罗助发同志也是委员之一。以后他组织人民武装成立赤卫队，坚持了永定革命斗争。当红军开始两万五千里长征后，国民党反动派对他搜索很紧，他曾一度被捕，受着敌人的严刑凌辱，他的妻子因被捕而惊吓成疯，终被害死。他说他这些年一直坚决相信：“共产党是为我们工农的，革命一定会在福建胜利、在中国胜利、在全世界胜利！”今天，他终于看到这胜利了。
    坚持游击战争
    六十三岁的陈蒲川同志是莆田农民代表。他原是个贫农，一九二四年就参加了革命，一九二六年加入共产党。最初因为反动派强迫农民种鸦片，无论种不种都抽重税，他便组织农民起来反对，赶走了“县长”，以后又领导农民组织“赤色农会”。逐渐地，会员都武装起来，与反动派进行了激烈的斗争。农民把他们当成救命恩人，为他们领路、侦探。那里的农民受欺太甚时，就都前来请求他们去救，他们一直坚持着游击战。到一九四八年后扩充到两千多游击队员准备和解放大军会师，一直到福建解放。二十几年来，陈蒲川同志始终领导着农民进行胜利的斗争。他曾负过伤，但是直到现在，他并没有因为年老而片刻休息。解放后，他马上又领导群众进行减租、反霸运动。因此，群众都相信他，相信共产党永远是农民的救星。
    四代沉冤
    “我有‘四代沉冤’，要不是来了共产党，我永远也得不到翻身。”
    顺昌县农民代表熊海连，真姓名叫揭光礼，述说到他几代人被地主和反动政权害死时，他一边说一边伤心落泪，哽咽不能成声。
    他原籍江西临川，曾祖父因天旱欠地主的租被地主活埋，祖父欠租被抓去送到县府死在监狱里，父亲则更因为欠租被地主揭花八的狗腿子当场打死。那时他大哥十二岁，二哥四岁，他才两岁，他母亲把他背在背上讨了七年饭，受冻受饿，能吃到点米糠都不容易。他七岁时替人家放牛，十三岁时母亲死去。临死前母亲向他述说了三代仇恨，叮嘱他要报此深仇血恨。
    可是，在国民党反动派和地主双重压迫下，他怎样能报仇呢？反而给欺压得几乎活不下去，为了吃饭，他仍给地主打长工。十九岁时，蒋匪抓壮丁，他三兄弟从此逃散。他自己买了一张假名“熊海连”的通行证才跑到福建邵武作长工。后来又租田种。一九三九年，秋收一半时，蒋匪又来抓丁。他丢了一切，翻山越岭，逃到顺昌来。他受苦受饿，直到去年五月游击队解放了顺昌，共产党和人民政府来了，才第一次遇到救命人。他自己是深知农民阶级痛苦的，因此就很积极地在共产党领导下为农民办事，现在他被选为代表，到“省城”来开会。在他这第四代可真翻了身。
    他说：“感谢共产党！我终于翻了身，现在我要申请把户籍上的假名字改回来，仍旧叫原名揭光礼。”
    农民离不开共产党
    解放后的农工，在共产党的教育下飞快的进步着，青年农民代表黄万乐是一个好例子。他今年只二十二岁，在福州解放短短几个月中，就被选为大根区农筹会主任，参加过好几次区农代会，市农代会，市各界代表会。这次又参加了省的农代会，并光荣地参加了主席团。
    解放前，地主常向他母子逼租，还拿枪威胁他母亲；恶霸把他田里的庄稼全部破坏，但他们不敢反抗。解放了，地主恶霸再不敢欺压农民，大根区也成立了自己的农会，他被选当了主任，领导农民减租，减回谷子一万一千多斤；说理斗争斗垮了恶霸陈国衡，开完了全区荒地共一百五十多亩，修好一条水坝；并组织大家多下肥、勤除草，准备搞好今年的生产。他说：“这些事我们农民先前都怕办不了，全靠共产党和人民政府帮助和教育我们才办好，共产党的恩情真是说不完。”
