Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 19th: The North China Grain Company began purchasing wheat throughout the North China region at the beginning of this month. Last month, the company allocated a large amount of cash to its subordinate companies at all levels and transferred over 78.8 million jin of coarse grains and soybean cakes from the Pingyuan and Hebei Provincial Companies to exchange for wheat from farmers. At the same time, to cooperate with the Grain Company's wheat purchasing work, the various state-owned specialized companies in North China are also actively transferring large quantities of industrial products to their subordinate branch companies to meet the needs of farmers in various regions. Since June, the North China Textile Company has transferred more than 110,000 bolts of various colored cloths and more than 800 pieces of coarse and fine yarn; the total value of daily necessities such as cloth, knitwear, alkali, and sugar allocated by the North China Department Store Company amounted to more than 50.7 billion yuan; the North China Petroleum Company allocated a total of more than 602,000 gallons of kerosene; and the Tianjin Directly Subordinate Company of the China Salt Industry Company transported more than 216,000 dan of edible salt to areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang. In order to correctly complete the wheat purchasing task, the various state-owned specialized companies instructed their subordinate companies at all levels to maintain close contact with the local grain companies and cooperate effectively. The North China Department Store Company has instructed its lower-level organizations to set up sales teams and use local cooperatives in wheat-producing areas where there are no branch companies to supply various daily-use industrial products in a timely manner. The Tianjin Salt and Coal Companies have made it convenient for farmers to exchange wheat for salt and coal.

During the purchasing process, the Grain Company took the initiative to maintain appropriate exchange ratios between the prices of wheat and coarse grains in various regions and to ensure that market wheat prices trended towards reasonableness. For example, in mid-June, it was the Dragon Boat Festival, and farmers were eager to sell wheat, so wheat prices in various regions were lower than those of coarse grains. After the company's purchase, prices gradually rose, and a certain price difference was maintained between producing and selling areas. However, in late June, some branch companies in some regions engaged in high-price purchases, so the China Grain Company once ordered a temporary suspension of purchases, maintaining a reasonable price for wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 19th: The East China Company of the China Grain Company has begun purchasing wheat in wheat-producing areas and is also transporting large quantities of supplies such as cloth, kerosene, matches, and coarse grains to various purchasing locations to supply farmers. The Shandong Branch of the China Grain Company has signed a contract with the local Supply and Marketing Cooperative to collect wheat on its behalf. The Industrial and Commercial Bureaus of the Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu major cities are actively preparing to form joint procurement committees to lead private merchants in organized and planned purchases.

This year in East China, except for some areas in Shandong, northern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu that suffered from insect pests or floods and droughts, wheat harvests in other areas were better than last year. The wheat harvest in Fujian Province was the best in nearly twenty years. Therefore, after the new wheat entered the market, grain companies at all levels paid attention to controlling prices, so that most areas eliminated the phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers" that often occurred before liberation. Market wheat prices and the prices of rice, yarn, and cloth were able to maintain appropriate proportions. Only in Huaiyin in northern Jiangsu and Gaomi in Shandong, because farmers were eager to sell wheat, wheat prices once fell in mid-June, but they have risen again after the Grain Company's purchasing work began; in late June, the price of wheat in Huaiyin rose from 500 yuan per jin to 600 yuan, and in Gaomi from 650 yuan to 750 yuan. In addition, in Wuxi and Bengbu, due to blind competition among private merchants, wheat prices rose by 13% in ten days in mid-June. After the Grain Company posted price adjustments, in early July, the price of wheat in Wuxi gradually decreased from 810 yuan per jin to 710 yuan, and the price of grain in Bengbu also fell slightly.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 19th: The state-owned grain companies of Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are systematically purchasing wheat. The focus of this purchase is mainly on Henan Province, which produces the most wheat. The province's grain company had already purchased more than 3.88 million jin of wheat in various regions from mid-June to the end of June. At the beginning of this month, the Hubei Grain Company also purchased more than 1.2 million jin in the three special districts of Daye, Xiaogan, and Mianyang. The Jiangxi Grain Company is vigorously purchasing in the four special districts of Jiujiang, Fuliang, Yingtan, and Zhangshu.

In the process of purchasing wheat, state-owned grain companies in various regions paid attention to mastering wheat price policies and reasonable price differences between producing and selling areas. For example, in Kaifeng, Henan, in mid-June, because many grain merchants from other places went to the market to purchase, the wheat price rose from more than 600 yuan per jin at the beginning of the month to 740 yuan, exceeding the reasonable price ratio. The Grain Company immediately stopped purchasing and appropriately sold off some, causing the wheat price to fall back to about 664 yuan per jin, close to a reasonable level. During the same period, wheat prices in the Zhumadian area of ​​the province were too low, and the Grain Company immediately made large-scale purchases. In the last ten days of the month, the wheat price rose from 455 yuan per jin in mid-month to more than 500 yuan. In addition to directly purchasing a portion, grain companies in various regions vigorously united with private merchants to jointly purchase. The Jiangxi Grain Company stipulated that private merchants would be paid a certain amount of handling fees by the company when purchasing wheat on behalf of the company, based on the distance of the route and other conditions. In the spirit of taking into account both public and private interests, the people's governments and grain companies in various regions have provided assistance to private merchants who operate legally, abolished unnecessary restrictions such as purchase permits and restrictions on purchase quantities, and allowed private merchants to conduct purchases freely without violating the government's price policies. On the other hand, in order to prevent the phenomenon of unilaterally taking care of farmers and disregarding the quality of grain prices during the purchasing process, the Central and Southern China Grain Region Company specifically stipulated the standards for the moisture content and impurities of wheat in various regions. Those that do not meet the standards will not be accepted, will be accepted less, or will have their prices reduced; those with too much fine wheat and those that are hot, deteriorated, moldy, rotten, or insect-eaten will not be accepted under any circumstances.

　　华北华东等地大量收购小麦
    以粗粮换购并以工业品供应农民
    掌握价格政策使麦价保持合理
    【新华社天津十九日电】华北区粮食公司已自本月初开始在华北全区收购小麦。该公司曾于上月拨给所属各级公司大批现金，并向平原、河北两省公司调出粗粮及豆饼七千八百余万斤，向农民换购小麦。同时，为了配合粮食公司的购麦工作，华北各国营专业公司也积极向所属分支公司调拨大量工业品，供应各地农民的需要。六月份以来，华北区花纱布公司调出各种色布十一万多匹，粗细纱八百多件；华北区百货公司调拨布匹、针织品、碱面、糖类等日用品的总金额为五百零七亿多元；华北区石油公司调拨煤油共六十万二千多加仑；中国盐业公司天津直属公司向北京、天津、石家庄等地区共输送食盐二十一万六千多担。为了正确完成购麦任务，各国营专业公司曾指示所属各级公司与当地粮食公司密切联系，有力配合。华北区百货公司已指示下级机构在未设分支公司的产麦地区设推销小组和通过当地合作社，及时供应各种日用工业品。天津盐业、煤业两公司则予农民可用小麦换购食盐、煤斤的方便。
    粮食公司在收购中主动将各地区小麦与粗粮的价格保持适当的交换比率，并使市场麦价趋向合理。如上月中旬适逢端午节，农民急于出售小麦，因此各地麦价均较粗粮为低。经该公司收购后，价格逐渐上升，并使产销地区保持一定的差价。但至六月下旬，部分地区分支公司发生高价收购现象，因此中国粮食公司曾一度指令暂停收购，保持了小麦的合理价格。
    【新华社上海十九日电】中国粮食公司华东区公司已在产麦地区开始收购小麦，同时并将大量布匹、煤油、火柴等用品及粗粮等，纷纷运抵各收购地点，供应农民。中国粮食公司山东分公司已与当地供销合作总社订立了代收小麦的合同。上海及苏南各大城市人民政府工商局正积极筹组联合采购委员会，领导私商有组织有计划地从事收购。
    华东今年除山东、皖北、苏南部分地区受虫灾或水旱灾外，其他各地小麦收成均比去年好，福建省小麦丰收更为近二十年来所未有。因此，新麦登场后各级粮食公司即注意掌握价格，使大部地区消除了各地解放前经常发生的“谷贱伤农”的现象，市场麦价与大米、纱、布价格均能保持适当比例。只有苏北的淮阴、山东的高密等地，因农民急欲出售小麦，六月中旬麦价曾一度下跌，但在粮食公司收购工作展开后业已回升；六月下旬淮阴麦价已由每斤五百元回升到六百元，高密由六百五十元回升到七百五十元。另外，无锡、蚌埠两地曾因私商盲目竞购，麦价在六月中旬的十天内上涨了百分之十三，经粮食公司挂牌调整后，七月上旬无锡麦价已由每斤八百一十元缓降为七百一十元，蚌埠粮价也已稍有回落。
    【新华社汉口十九日电】河南、湖北和江西三省国营粮食公司正在有计划地收购小麦。这次收购重点主要是在产麦最多的河南省。该省粮食公司早在六月中旬至六月底即已在各地收购小麦三百八十八万多斤。湖北粮食公司本月初旬，也已在大冶、孝感、沔阳三个专区收购了一百二十多万斤。江西粮食公司则正在九江、浮梁、鹰潭、樟树等四个专区大力收购中。
    各地国营粮食公司在购麦中都注意掌握麦价政策和产销地区的合理差价。如河南开封在六月中旬因外埠粮商多至市场收购，麦价由初旬的每斤六百多元升到七百四十元，超过合理比价。粮食公司当即停止收购，并适当抛售一部，使麦价回跌至每斤六百六十四元左右，接近合理水平。同一时期，该省驻马店一带麦价过低，粮食公司即行大量收购，下旬麦价即由中旬的每斤四百五十五元升至五百多元。各地粮食公司除直接收购一部外，均大力团结私商，合力收购。江西粮食公司根据路程的远近及其他各种条件，规定私商代公司购麦时，由公司付给一定数目的手续费。各地人民政府、粮食公司本公私兼顾精神，对合法经营的私商都予以帮助，取消了采购证及限制收购数量等不必要的限制，让私商在不违背政府的价格政策的条件下，自由进行采购。另一方面，为防止在收购中发生片面照顾农民而不顾粮价质量好坏的现象，中南粮食区公司曾具体规定各地小麦所含水分和杂质的标准，不合标准的不收、少收或降低价格；其细麦过多及发热、变坏、霉烂、虫蚀者则一律不收。
