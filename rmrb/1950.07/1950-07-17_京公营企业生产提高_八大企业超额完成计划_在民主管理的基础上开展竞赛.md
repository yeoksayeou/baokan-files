Production Increase in Beijing Public Enterprises
Eight Major Enterprises Exceed Plans
Competition Launched Based on Democratic Management

　　The production of Beijing's public factories and enterprises in May and June took another step forward compared to the past. Various units created many new records and solved some problems that had not been solved for many years. Many units exceeded their production plans. The main reasons for these achievements are that the units initially implemented democratic management and launched production competitions on the basis of democratic management. At the same time, the workers displayed a high degree of work enthusiasm in order to commemorate Red May and welcome "July 1st."

　　Among the larger public factories and enterprises in Beijing, eight units, including the Tram Company, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Changxindian Railway Factory, the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Waterworks Company, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Beijing Factory of the North China Paper Company, and the XinJian Glass Factory, continuously exceeded their production plans in May and June. The Qinghe Woolen Mill, the Beijing Machine Factory, and the Shijingshan Power Plant, etc., did not complete their plans in May, but by June, the Qinghe Woolen Mill exceeded its quota, completing 103.5% of its plan; the Beijing Machine Factory completed 100% of its plan; although the Shijingshan Power Plant did not complete its plan in terms of power generation and self-use power, the coal consumption, which accounted for half of the cost, was reduced to 0.768 kg, which was 0.047 kg less than the quota. The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory exceeded its plan in May, but in June, due to temporary changes in production tasks, some parts exceeded the plan, and some parts were not completed. The Beijing Telecommunications Bureau calculated on a quarterly basis and launched a production competition starting in April. As a result, the number of outgoing errors in June decreased by 46.1% compared to March. In addition, six units, including the Public Bus Company, the China People's Printing Factory, the Beijing Postal Administration Bureau, the Jingxi Coal Mining Company, the Beijing Clothing Factory, and the Beijing Transportation Company, failed to complete their production plans for two consecutive months.

　　Among the eight units that exceeded their plans, the most outstanding achievements were made by the Tram Company and the Liulihe Cement Plant. Under the leadership of Deputy Managers Jia Tingsan and Wang Zhenwu, the Tram Company relied on the efforts of all its employees, and all departments created new records. The power plant saved a large amount of coal and electricity, and the number of passengers on the vehicle lines exceeded the plan for both months. Workers in the repair factory improved tools and operating methods, which raised labor productivity. Last year, it took 674 workdays to build a locomotive; now it only takes 500 workdays. Efficiency has increased by a quarter. Therefore, the original plan to complete 18 new locomotives by the end of August was completed on June 25th. Now, the employees of the repair factory have put forward the slogan of completing the annual production task by the end of September.

　　The Liulihe Cement Plant did not complete its production tasks in January, February, and March this year. It began to exceed its plan in April. In May, it produced 10,414 tons of cement, exceeding the plan by 28.5%, creating a new record since the plant was built in 1944. In June, it created an even higher new record, producing 12,830 tons of cement, exceeding the plan by 32%.

　　The Public Bus Company had relatively poor results in production. In the past six months, through the efforts of all employees, although the number of buses and passengers increased month by month, and costs decreased month by month, and many rationalization proposals and technical improvements emerged, the ideological reliance on workers by the administrative leadership was not clear, and the style of bureaucracy and officialism was quite serious, coupled with the fact that the Municipal Enterprise Company sometimes failed to solve problems in a timely manner in its leadership. Therefore, it has not completed its production plan for half a year and has suffered losses every month. The losses in May and June amounted to 271,374 jin of millet. The vehicle failure rate in June was as high as 48.8%. There was a great waste of coal, but there were not even accurate statistics on how much was wasted. The company only recently began to establish a management committee, preparing to solve some major production problems.

　　　　　Several Experiences in Improving Production Efficiency

　　The production situation of the above 19 units in May and June once again illustrates the following experiences:

　　First, it is necessary to rely on the workers, implement democratic management, and follow the mass line. This is the first experience summarized by the Tram Company. Because the Tram Company did this, it created the unity of the entire company, generated a large number of rationalization proposals, solved the problem of cars breaking down in the rain that had not been solved for many years, successfully built the ring road that had not been possible several times before liberation, and increased labor productivity. Under the same circumstances, the Liulihe Cement Plant overcame various difficulties in the operation of old machines and continuously created new records; the Shijingshan Power Plant solved the problem of coal dust escaping. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Beijing Machine Factory, and other units have significantly improved production efficiency after establishing factory management committees and earnestly using these institutions. In mid-April, employees of the Public Bus Company submitted more than 200 suggestions, most of which were related to production. However, for more than two months, the administrative leadership has only implemented one suggestion, in addition to explaining some of the suggestions. This has affected the enthusiasm of employees and prevented many production problems from being solved in a timely manner.

　　Second, launching production competitions is the best way to improve labor productivity. Units that have launched production competitions, such as the Changxindian Railway Factory, the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Beijing Factory of the North China Paper Company, and the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, have exceeded their plans.

　　Third, the production plans of the entire factory, groups, and individuals, which have been carefully discussed by employees, are extremely helpful in improving production. The Tram Company, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Changxindian Railway Factory, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Shijingshan Power Plant, etc., all established plans in this way, making them the goals of the employees' own struggle. The production plan of the Public Bus Company was not submitted to the workers for serious discussion, and the plans of the Beijing Postal Administration Bureau and the Beijing Clothing Factory were not realistic, which affected the completion of the tasks.

　　In these two months, some units have not only relied on increasing the labor intensity of workers to improve production, but have also further improved labor organization, operating methods, and production technology. The Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau improved the organization of the Group B and C inspection and repair teams, so that Group B inspection man-hours were reduced by 30% compared with the standard, and Group C inspection man-hours were reduced by 35%. In order to shorten transfer and station stopping times, Fengtai Station improved operating methods. As a result, the station stopping time in June was shortened by 27% compared with May, and the transfer time was shortened by 21%. After improving labor organization in June, the iron smelting efficiency of the casting workshop of the Changxindian Railway Factory doubled compared with May. The Beijing Machine Factory established technical mutual aid groups and held technical lectures. The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and other units have begun to promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang group, and other units have generally paid attention to improving technology. In addition, in May, the casting department of the Beijing Machine Factory signed a collective contract, and as a result, the output exceeded the contract quota by 28%, and the workers received a bonus of 5,700 jin of millet. In June, the Shijingshan Power Plant signed a collective contract for the entire factory, and various departments signed contact contracts. The Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and other units are promoting the work of signing contracts.

　　In the past, the reward work of various units was not done well enough, and many advanced producers did not receive timely and appropriate rewards. In June, the Tram Company, the Public Bus Company, and the Waterworks Company successively held award ceremonies, appropriately rewarding employees who had contributed to production in the past. Recently, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Liulihe Cement Plant, and other units have also issued awards, and the morale of employees has been further improved. They are all preparing to create more new records in the July production competition.

　　京公营企业生产提高
    八大企业超额完成计划
    在民主管理的基础上开展竞赛
    【京市新闻处讯】五六月份北京公营工厂企业的生产，比以前又提高了一步。各单位创造了不少新纪录，解决了一些多年没有解决的问题。许多单位超额完成了生产计划。得到这些成绩的主要原因，是各单位初步实行了民主管理，并在民主管理的基础上展开了生产竞赛；同时，职工们为了纪念红五月和迎接“七一”，发挥了高度的工作热情。
    在北京较大的公营工厂企业里，电车公司、琉璃河水泥厂、长辛店铁路工厂、天津铁路局北京分局、自来水公司、石景山钢铁厂、华北造纸公司北京厂、新建玻璃厂等八个单位，五六月份连续超额完成生产计划。清河制呢厂、北京机器厂、石景山发电厂等，在五月份虽然没有完成计划，但是到六月份，清河制呢厂超过了定额，完成计划百分之一○三点五；北京机器厂完成计划百分之百；石景山发电厂在发电量、自用电等方面虽然没有完成计划，但是占成本一半的煤耗，已减低到○·七六八公斤，比定额少○·○四七公斤。华北农业机械厂五月份超过了计划，六月份因为生产任务临时变动，所以部分超过计划，部分没有完成。北京电信局是按季度计算，自四月份起展开了生产竞赛，结果，六月份的出局差错比三月份降低了百分之四十六点一。此外，公共汽车公司、中国人民印刷厂、北京邮政管理局、京西煤矿公司、北京被服厂、北京运输公司等六个单位，连续两个月没有完成生产计划。
    在超额完成计划的八个单位里，成绩最突出的是电车公司和琉璃河水泥厂。电车公司在贾庭三、王镇武正副经理领导下，依靠全体职工的努力，各部门都创造了新纪录。发电厂节省了大批的煤电，车路上两个月的乘客人数都超过了计划。修造厂工人改良工具和操作方法，提高了劳动生产率。去年下半年造一辆机车，要用六百七十四个工，现在只用五百个工就行了。效率提高了四分之一。因此，原计划到八月底完成的新造机车十八辆，在六月二十五日就已经全部完成。现在修造厂职工又提出九月底完成全年生产任务的口号。
    琉璃河水泥厂在今年一、二、三月份，都没有完成生产任务。四月份开始超过计划。五月份生产水泥一万零四百一十四吨，超过计划百分之二十八点五，创造了一九四四年建厂以来最高的新纪录。六月份又创了更高的新纪录，生产水泥一万二千八百三十吨，超过计划百分之三十二。
    在生产方面成绩比较差的是公共汽车公司。半年来，该公司经过全体职工的努力，虽然出车数、乘客数逐月增多，成本逐月减低，并且出现了不少合理化建议和技术改进，但是由于行政领导上依靠工人的思想不明确，事务主义和官僚主义作风相当严重，加上市企业公司在领导上有时不及时解决问题。因此，半年来一直没有完成生产计划，月月亏累。五六月份亏损合小米二十七万一千三百七十四斤。六月份的车辆故障率还高到百分之四十八点八。煤炭有很大的浪费，但是浪费多少，连精确的统计数字都没有。到最近公司才着手成立管委会，准备解决一些生产上的主要问题。
            提高生产效率的几点经验
    以上十九个单位五、六月份的生产情况，再一次地说明了下列几点经验：
    第一，必须依靠工人，实行民主管理，走群众路线。这是电车公司总结出的第一条经验。电车公司因为这样做了，才造成全公司的团结，产生了大批合理化建议，解决了多年没解决的下雨坏车的问题，办好了解放以前几次都行不通的环行路，提高了劳动生产率。在同样情况下，琉璃河水泥厂克服了老机器运转上的各种困难，连续创造新纪录；石景山发电厂解决了跑煤粉问题。石景山钢铁厂、北京机器厂等单位，在成立了工厂管理委员会并且认真运用这个机构以后，生产效率都已显著地提高。汽车公司职工四月中旬提过二百多条意见，大部分是对生产方面的建议。但是两个多月来，行政领导上除对一部分意见作了解释外，只实行了一条。这样就影响了职工的积极性，使许多生产上的问题，不能及时地解决。
    第二，开展生产竞赛是提高劳动生产率的最好办法。凡是开展了生产竞赛的单位，如长辛店铁路工厂、石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、琉璃河水泥厂、华北造纸公司北京厂、华北农业机械厂等，都超额完成了计划。
    第三，经过职工认真讨论后所订立的全厂的、小组的和个人的生产计划，对提高生产作用极大。电车公司、琉璃河水泥厂、长辛店铁路工厂、石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂等单位都是这样订立了计划，使它成为职工自己的奋斗目标。汽车公司的生产计划没有交给工人认真讨论，北京邮政管理局、北京被服厂的计划都不切合实际，因此影响到任务的完成。
    在这两个月里，有些单位已经不只是依靠增加工人的劳动强度来提高生产，而是进一步的改善劳动组织、操作方法和生产技术。天津铁路局北京分局改善了乙丙检包修组的组织，使乙检工时比标准减少百分之三十，丙检工时减少百分之三十五。丰台站为缩短中转和停站时间，改善了操作方法。结果六月份停站时间比五月份缩短了百分之二十七，中转时间缩短了百分之二十一。长辛店铁路工厂六月里改善劳动组织后，铸工场的化铁效率就比五月份提高了一倍。北京机器厂成立了技术互助小组，举办了技术讲演会。华北农业机械厂、石景山发电厂等单位已经开始推行马恒昌小组的经验，其他单位也一般地都注意到改进技术。此外，北京机器厂铸工部五月里订了集体合同，结果产量超过了合同定额的百分之二十八，工人得了五千七百斤小米的奖金。石景山发电厂六月里订了全厂的集体合同，各部门订立了联系合同。天津铁路局北京分局、石景山钢铁厂等，都在推行订立合同的工作。
    以前各单位的奖励工作做的很不够，许多先进生产者都没有得到及时的、适当的奖励。六月里，电车公司、汽车公司、自来水公司先后举行了发奖大会，适当的奖励了以前对生产有功的职工。最近石景山钢铁厂、琉璃河水泥厂等单位也发了奖，职工情绪更加提高，都准备在七月份的生产竞赛里，再多创些新纪录。
