　　Relief Fund Drive for Unemployed Workers Concludes
    All Circles in Beijing Donate 2 Billion Yuan
    ACFTU Decides to Use Half of the Donations to Aid Unemployed Workers in the City
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on the 12th regarding the conclusion of the relief fund donation work for unemployed workers, stating:

    The donation work for relief of unemployed workers in the city has concluded. As of July 5th, the total amount of donations received by the People's Bank of China Headquarters and the Beijing Branch in the Beijing area reached 2,004,053,290.88 yuan. After deducting the returned portion of erroneously paid donations (including 1,799,193 yuan from the Guangming Daily and 173,610 yuan from the Liaodong Provincial Department of Industry), the actual amount received was 2,003,856,087.88 yuan. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has allocated half of the above-mentioned donations, 1,001,900,000 yuan (one billion one million nine hundred thousand yuan), plus 280,043.94 yuan from some cadres, to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for the purpose of providing relief to unemployed workers in the city (the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions plans to transfer the funds to the "Beijing Unemployed Workers Relief Committee" for unified use).
            Workers, commanders and fighters, teachers and students, and government cadres enthusiastically donated in various ways.
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the news of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions' letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, calling for relief for unemployed workers in Shanghai, was published in Beijing newspapers and periodicals on April 17th, the factories and mining enterprises directly under the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions immediately launched a donation drive. Later, in order to enthusiastically respond to the call issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for all employed workers and staff nationwide to donate one day's wage to provide relief to unemployed workers, and to more effectively support unemployed workers in Shanghai and other places, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially invited the Municipal Government, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Political Department of the North China Military Region, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Women's Federation, and the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Education Workers' Union to a meeting on April 25th and established the "Beijing Unemployed Workers Relief Committee." Comrade Xiao Ming of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions served as the chairman. Immediately afterward, a widespread appeal for relief for unemployed workers was issued, adhering to the principle of voluntary participation, and a comprehensive and enthusiastic mobilization for donation work was launched. Workers, staff, soldiers, teachers, students, and government cadres throughout the city, fully understanding the great significance of the donations, highly developed the spirit of class friendship, unity, and mutual assistance, and enthusiastically donated by adopting methods such as economizing, doing voluntary labor, charity performances, charity matches, or donating one day's wage. As of July 5th, the donation work of various units has concluded, and the total amount of donations received by the People's Bank of China Headquarters and the Beijing Branch in the Beijing area totaled 2,004,053,290.88 yuan. Among them, workers and staff in factories, mines, railways, and enterprises donated a total of 1,086,529,659.38 yuan (including factories and enterprises: 299,419,372.5 yuan; railways: 188,174,626 yuan; coal mines: 94,151,789 yuan; small enterprise trade unions: 47,847,369.88 yuan; shop employee unions: 22,574,530 yuan; handicraft unions: 18,555,100 yuan; porter unions: 4,146,130 yuan; cultural and educational unions: 118,121,536 yuan; education worker unions: 239,228,340 yuan; others: 67,453,231 yuan). Donations from government agencies: 315,593,683 yuan. Donations from the army: 519,760,101 yuan. Donations from political parties and organizations: 90,018,260 yuan. Donations from other sources: 28,468,187.5 yuan. In addition, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions collected 63 pieces of clothing, one swimming automatic watch, and one gold ring on behalf of others.
            The relief movement greatly strengthened the unity of the working class.
    Through this donation drive to provide relief to unemployed workers, the close unity of the working class itself has been greatly strengthened, class consciousness has been raised, and it has had a great impact on the masses of workers and staff. It is a very good class education and a great class mutual assistance. Workers generally reflected: "In the past, no one cared about us workers. Now we have the leadership of the trade union and the care of the People's Government. We cannot let a single one of us starve to death!" "We shout every day that the working class is one family. Now that the workers in Shanghai are in trouble, we have to show our support!" "To truly help our unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai, we must step up production, support the front lines, and eliminate the remaining bandits who create the suffering of workers." There are countless examples of enthusiastic donations. For example, the 125 workers of the Broadcasting Equipment Repair Factory donated 3,870,500 yuan. Han Xintian, a worker at the Water Company, donated 100 jin of millet, and Zhang Binghua donated 103 jin of millet. Wu Zuncai and Yuan Shixin, two workers in the slaughtering industry, each donated 19 days' wages. The Railway Corps donated all 6,500 jin of millet saved from their meals. Chen Yongkang, an overseas Chinese student at the Central Academy of Drama, donated his swimming automatic watch. Schools and cinemas held charity competitions and performances. Government agencies and organizations also launched a donation drive of one day's salary (salary system) and one jin of rice (supply system). Therefore, this donation movement to provide relief to unemployed workers was carried out very widely. Whether in factories, mines, railways, government agencies, troops, schools, or organizations, a completely conscious and voluntary donation movement was launched everywhere.
    Because this relief donation movement was carried out in an organized and led manner from the beginning, adhering to the principle of voluntary participation, it prevented the possibility of coercive orders and paternalistic practices. Only a few units had trade unions already launching donations, and later the administrative side deducted two jin of millet per employee as a donation when issuing wages, without contacting the trade union beforehand, and the methods were too simple, causing employee dissatisfaction. There were many other shortcomings in the work, such as insufficient communication with the People's Bank in terms of receiving payments, failing to clear the accounts daily, and insufficient work in reporting to superiors and in public reporting in newspapers.

　　救济失业工人捐款运动结束
    京各界共捐款二十亿元
    全总决定以捐款之半数救济本市失业工人
    【本报讯】北京市总工会于十二日发出关于结束救济失业工人捐款工作的通知称：
    本市救济失业工人捐款工作已经结束。截至七月五日止，人民银行总行及北京分行所收北京区捐款总数共达二十亿四千零五十三万二千八百九十元八角八分，除去误缴退还部分外（内光明日报社一、七九九、一九三元，辽东省工业厅一七三、六一○元），实收二十亿三千八百五十六万零八十七元八角八分。全国总工会已将上列捐款之半数十亿一千九百部分干部的二十八万零四十三元九角四分拨交市总工会作为救济本市失业工人之用（市总拟将该款转拨“北京市失业工人救济委员会”统一使用）。
            职工、指战员、学校师生、机关干部等以各种方式踊跃捐输。
    【本报讯】自四月十七日京市各报刊载了上海总工会致函全国总工会呼吁救济上海失业工人的消息后，市总工会直属的各厂矿企业立即发动了救济捐款工作。后来市总工会为了热烈响应全国总工会发出的关于全国在业工人、职员捐献一日工资救济失业工人的号召，并为着更有力地支援上海等地的失业工人，于四月二十五日特邀请市政府、中共北京市委会、华北军区政治部、市劳动局、市公安局、团市工委、市妇联、市教育工作者工会筹委会等单位开会，成立了“北京市救济失业工人委员会”。市总萧明同志担任主任委员。随即普遍发出救济失业工人的号召，坚持自觉自愿的原则，全面热烈展开救济捐款的动员工作。全市工人、职员、战士、教员、学生、机关干部由于充分了解到捐款的伟大意义，高度发挥了阶级友爱、团结互助的精神；采取节约，做义务工、义演、义赛或捐献一日工资等方式，踊跃捐输。截至七月五日止，各单位捐款工作已经结束，人民银行总行及北京分行所收北京区捐款总数共计二十亿四千零五十三万二千八百九十元八角八分。其中厂矿、铁路、企业行业职工共捐款十亿八千六百五十二万九千六百五十九元三角八分（内工厂企业：二亿九千九百四十一万九千三百七十二元五角。铁路：一亿八千八百一十七万四千六百二十六元。煤矿：九千四百一十五万一千七百八十九元。小型企业工会：四千七百八十四万七千三百六十九元八角八分。店员工会：二千二百五十七万四千五百三十元。手工业工会：一千八百五十五万五千一百元。搬运工会：四百一十四万六千一百三十元。文教工会：一亿一千八百一十二万一千五百三十六元。教育工作者工会：二亿三千九百二十二万八千三百四十元。其他：六千七百四十五万三千二百三十一元）。机关捐款：三亿一千五百五十九万三千六百八十三元。部队捐款：五亿一千九百七十六万又一百零一元。党派社团捐款：九千零十八万一千二百六十元。其他方面捐款：二千八百四十六万八千一百八十七元五角。另市总代收衣物六十三件，游泳自动手表一个，金戒指一只。
            救济运动大大加强了工人阶级的团结。
    通过这次救济失业工人捐款运动，大大加强了工人阶级本身的紧密团结，提高了阶级觉悟，对职工群众影响很大，是一次很好的阶级教育与很大的阶级互助。工人普遍反映：“以前我们工人没人管，现在有工会领导我们，人民政府照顾我们，不能叫我们饿死一个人了！”“天天喊工人阶级是一家，现在上海工人有了困难，咱们就得有表现！”“要真正援助上海失业工人兄弟，只有加紧生产，支援前线，消灭制造工人痛苦的残余匪帮。”热心捐款的例子不胜枚举。如广播器材修造厂职工一百二十五人，就捐了三百八十七万零五百元。自来水公司工人韩心田捐了一百斤小米，张炳华捐了一零三斤小米。屠宰业工人吴尊才、袁士馨二人均捐出十九天的工资。铁道兵团将伙食节约的六千五百斤小米全部捐出。中央戏剧学院华侨学生陈永康捐出了自己的游泳自动手表。学校、电影院并举行了义赛义演。机关团体也展开了一日薪（薪给制）一斤米（供给制）的捐献运动。因此这次救济失业工人的捐款运动，开展得非常普遍，无论工厂、矿山、铁路、机关、部队、学校、团体到处都掀起了完全自觉自愿的捐款运动。
    这次救济捐款运动由于一开始便是有组织有领导的在进行，坚持自觉自愿的原则，因此防止了可能发生的强迫命令、包办代替的作法。仅少数几个单位本已有工会发动捐款，而后来行政方面于发工资时，又扣职工每人二斤小米做为捐款，且事先不与工会联系，方式方法又过于简单致引起职工不满。其他工作中的缺点还有不少，如在收款方面与人民银行的联系不够，没有作到一日一清，又如对上级汇报及在报纸上的公开报导等工作都作得不够。
