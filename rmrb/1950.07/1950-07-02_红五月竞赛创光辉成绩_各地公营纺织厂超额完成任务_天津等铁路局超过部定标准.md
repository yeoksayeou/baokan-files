　　Red May Competition Creates Brilliant Achievements
    Public Textile Factories in Various Regions Overfulfill Tasks
    Tianjin and Other Railway Bureaus Exceed Ministry Standards
    [Reported by this newspaper] During the Red May production competition, public cotton textile factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places improved efficiency, enhanced quality, reduced costs, and generally completed and exceeded production tasks.
    Tianjin China Textile
    The six factories produced 20,241.96 pieces of yarn in May, exceeding the plan by 7.1%; produced 477,366 bolts of cloth, exceeding the plan by 7.3%. The average unit output of cloth increased from 45.92 yards in April to 46.28 yards; among them, the unit output of 20-count yarn in Factory No. 6 reached 2.124 pounds, exceeding the plan by 15.11%. The rate of substandard cloth also gradually decreased, with Factory No. 3 reducing the substandard cloth rate to below 1%, and more than one-third of the workers in the cloth factory completely eliminated substandard cloth; the dyeing workshop in Factory No. 7 once achieved a 100% rate of standard cloth. The coal consumption of the power departments in each factory, the return of cotton waste and roller waste in the yarn factories, were greatly reduced, thereby lowering costs.
    Qingdao China Textile
    Factories No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, as well as the printing and dyeing factory and the shuttle factory, fully launched a production competition in Red May. Due to sufficient preparation and meticulous planning, the competition moved forward steadily, basically completing or exceeding the company's production plan.
    Taking Factory No. 4 as an example: the output of yarn increased by 4.5%, the output of cloth increased by 2.4%, the return waste rate decreased by 22%, and the substandard cloth rate and zero cloth rate also decreased by 38%.
    Jinan Public Yarn Factory
    The provincial-run Renfeng, Chengda, and Zichuan Luxin yarn factories, in the Red May production competition, produced 2,561.94 pieces of yarn for the entire month, exceeding the plan by 3.6%, an increase of 6.83% compared to April. Renfeng and Chengda factories jointly produced 24,260 bolts of cotton cloth, exceeding the plan by 5.06%, an increase of 8.31% compared to April.
    The reasons for the success of production in each factory are: the sufficient supply of raw materials and materials, clarifying the production plan of the competition in the minds of the masses (factory, group, and individual), establishing workshop contact contracts, mobilizing workers to discuss working methods, establishing scientific record-keeping, handover inspections, summary and other production management systems, and paying attention to protecting the health of employees. For example, in April, Tianjin China Textile successively re-elected or reorganized unsound trade union groups, workshop committees, or factory committees, strengthening the leading role in production; and established a mass inspection system in which the subsequent process inspects the previous process; trade union groups also regularly inspected production and actively urged administrative inspection work, thus ensuring the success of the production competition. Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory adjusted the mechanical distance of the spinning section, increased the operating speed, and improved production. Qingdao China Textile paid attention to summarizing the production experience of advanced workers and advanced groups, and promptly disseminated and promoted it, which also improved production technology.

    [Reported by this newspaper] Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan and other railway administrations have made great achievements in the Red May production competition.
    Tianjin Railway Administration
    In May, new labor organizations were established, new operation methods were used, and the creativity and enthusiasm of employees were inspired. In terms of transportation, the number of tons of goods sent exceeded the predetermined plan by 16%, and the number of loaded cars exceeded the predetermined plan by 10%; in terms of technical operations, the freight car turnaround rate was 1.61 days, shortening the planned 0.19 days, and the freight car stay time at the station was 10.5 hours, shortening the planned 14%; in terms of locomotives, the average daily car mileage was 409.7 kilometers, and the technical speed was 33.2 kilometers, both exceeding the ministry-set standards, thus making 150 locomotives surplus for the entire line, which can be used for 1,000 kilometers of new lines; the overhaul work was also fully completed or exceeded the plan, with the three machine factories in Tianjin, Nankou, and Zhangjiakou exceeding the task by an average of 30%; other aspects such as road maintenance, electrical maintenance, rationalization proposals, and inventions also had good results.
    Jinan Railway Administration
    In response to the Ministry of Railways' call to "establish a normal order in transportation and reduce railway transportation costs," the transportation work achieved significant results in the May merit campaign. In May, the bureau's passenger trains achieved 100% on-time departure and 99% on-time arrival; freight trains achieved 97% on-time departure and 90% on-time arrival, all exceeding the ministry's plan. The bureau's May loading and unloading tasks were overfulfilled by 115% and 133% respectively. The technical speed and daily car kilometers of locomotives throughout the bureau also exceeded the plan, thus shortening the vehicle turnaround rate by 0.3 days compared to the plan.
    Taiyuan Railway Administration
    In May, the freight car turnaround rate of the standard gauge was shortened from 1.4 days before the competition to 1.35 days, and the freight car turnaround rate of the narrow gauge was shortened from 1.98 days to 1.87 days. The on-time arrival of standard gauge passenger cars, the on-time departure of narrow gauge passenger cars, and the on-time departure and arrival of standard and narrow gauge freight cars all exceeded the ministry-set standards. Other aspects such as locomotive maintenance and vehicle electrical maintenance also exceeded the ministry-set tasks.
    The main reasons for achieving the above results are that the bureaus implemented joint labor and new operation methods, established a responsibility system, and some units also signed collective contracts and contact contracts, so the enthusiasm of employees was fully brought into play.

　　红五月竞赛创光辉成绩
    各地公营纺织厂超额完成任务
    天津等铁路局超过部定标准
    【本报讯】天津、青岛、济南等地公营棉纺织厂在红五月生产竞赛中，效率提高，质量改善，成本降低，普遍完成和超过了生产任务。
    天津中纺
    六个厂五月份产纱二万零二百四十一点九六件，超过计划百分之七点一；产布四十七万七千三百六十六匹，超过计划百分之七点三。布的平均单位产量由四月份的四十五点九二码提高到四十六点二八码；其中六厂二十支纱单位产量达到二点一二四磅，超过计划百分之十五点一一。次布率也逐渐降低，三厂的次布率降至百分之一以下，占三分之一以上工友的布厂完全消灭了次布；七厂染布场曾一度达到百分之百的正布率。各厂原动部的用煤量，纱厂的回花下脚及皮辊花均大大减少，因之降低了成本。
    青岛中纺
    一、二、三、四、五、六、八、九各厂及印染、梭管厂，在红五月中全面展开生产竞赛，由于准备充分、计划周密，竞赛运动稳步向前，基本上完成或超过了公司的生产计划。
    以四厂为例：纱的产量提高了百分之四点五，布的产量提高了百分之二点四，回花率降低了百分之二十二，次布率及零布率也减少了百分之三十八。
    济南公营纱厂
    省营的仁丰、成大及淄川鲁新纱厂等，在红五月生产竞赛中，全月产纱二、五六一点九四件，超过计划百分之三点六，较四月份增产百分之六点八三。仁丰、成大二厂共产棉布二四、二六○匹，超过计划百分之五点○六，较四月份增产百分之八点三一。
    各厂生产获得成绩的原因是：原料和物料的充分供应，在群众思想上明确竞赛的生产计划（厂、小组及个人），订立车间联系合同，发动工人中讨论工作方法，建立科学的成绩纪录、交接班检查、总结等生产管理的各种制度，注意保护职工身体健康等项工作。如天津中纺在四月间，先后改选或整顿了不健全的工会小组、车间委员会或工厂委员会，加强了对生产的领导作用；并建立了后一工序检查前一工序的群众性的检查制度；工会小组也定期检查生产，并主动督促行政检查工作，因而保证了生产竞赛获得成绩。济南仁丰纱厂调整了纺部机械距离，增加了运转速度，提高了生产。青岛中纺注意总结先进工人与先进组的生产经验，及时传播推广，也使生产技术提高一步。

    【本报讯】天津、济南、太原等铁路管理局在红五月生产竞赛中都有很大成绩。
    天津铁路管理局
    在五月份建立了新的劳动组织，运用了新的作业方法，启发了职工的创造性和积极性。全路在运输方面，货物发送吨数超过预定计划百分之十六，装车数超过预定计划百分之十；技术作业方面，货车周转率为一点六一天，较计划缩短○点一九天，货车在站停留时间为十点五小时，较计划缩短了百分之十四；机务方面，日车公里平均为四○九点七公里，技术速度为三十三点二公里，均超过了部定标准，因而使全路机车运用多余出一百五十台，可供新线一千公里运用；检修工作也全部完成或超过计划，天津、南口、张家口三个机厂平均超过任务百分之三十；其他如养路、电务维修、合理化建议、创造发明等方面均有良好成绩。
    济南铁路管理局
    响应铁道部“建立运输上的正常秩序，降低铁路运输成本”的号召，在五月份立功运动中，运输工作获得显著成绩。该局五月份旅客列车达到百分之百正点发车，百分之九十九正点到达；货车达到百分之九十七正点发车，百分之九十正点到达，均超过了部定计划。该局五月份装车任务与卸车任务各以百分之一一五与百分之一三三超额完成。全局机车的技术速度与日车公里也都超过计划，因而使车辆周转率比计划缩短了○点三天。
    太原铁路管理局
    五月份准轨的货车周转率由竞赛前以一点四天缩短到一点三五天，窄轨的货车周转率由一点九八天缩短到一点八七天。准轨客车到达正点，窄轨客车始发正点，及准、窄轨的货车始发，到达正点均超过了部定标准。其他如机务检修、车电检修方面均超过了部定任务。
    获得以上成绩的主要原因，是各局实行了联合劳动和新作业法，建立了负责制，若干单位还订立了集体合同和联系合同，职工的积极性因而得以充分发挥。
