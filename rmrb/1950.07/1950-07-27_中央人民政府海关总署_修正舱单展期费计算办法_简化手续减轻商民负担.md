　　General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government
    Revises Calculation Method for Manifest Extension Fees
    Simplifies Procedures and Reduces Burden on Merchants
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch] The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government, in order to reduce the burden on merchants and simplify procedures, has decided to revise the calculation method for manifest extension fees (a cargo list submitted to customs by a ship after import) and has notified customs offices in various locations to implement it. The revised method changes the original provision that manifest extension fees be "calculated until the date of payment of the relevant cargo taxes" to "calculated until the day before the import cargo declaration is submitted." Note: In the past, customs levied manifest extension fees on ships carrying imported goods for which customs declarations and tax payments were overdue, as stipulated, from shipping companies (or shipping agencies) until the day before the cargo taxes were paid. However, cargo declaration and tax payment were not necessarily completed in one procedure, so they were often collected once when the cargo was declared and again when the tax was paid, which was cumbersome and increased the burden on merchants. After the General Administration of Customs announced this revised method, the above-mentioned drawbacks can be avoided.

    修正舱单展期费计算办法   
    简化手续减轻商民负担
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府海关总署为减轻商民负担并简化手续起见，已决定修正舱单（船舶进口后交给海关的载货清单）展期费计算办法，并已通知各地海关执行。该办法将原定舱单展期费“算至有关货物税款缴清之日为止”的规定，修正为“算至递入进口货物报单之先一日为止”。按：过去海关对于载运进口货物逾期未报关完税的船只，按规定向轮船公司（或船行）征收舱单展期费，直至货物完纳税款的前一天为止。但是货物报关与缴款并不一定在一项手续中办完，因此往往在货物报关时征收一次，完税时又征收一次，手续繁复，而且增加商民负担。在海关总署公布这次修正办法后，上述弊病即可避免。
