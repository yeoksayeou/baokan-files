　　Industrial Testing Laboratory Union Re-elects Executive Committee Members
    Emphasis on Promoting Business Research  Correcting the Tendency to Focus Solely on Welfare
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Industrial Testing Laboratory Union previously overemphasized welfare work and did not pay enough attention to strengthening members' political study and research work. It has begun to correct this since the re-election of the Executive Committee in early June. The union has been established for fifteen months, and the majority of its members are researchers, but the proportion of researchers among the first and second Executive Committee members was relatively small. In the past, the union did very well in welfare work such as cooperatives, family dormitories, night schools for service personnel, and providing loans to impoverished members. However, the theoretical studies it organized tended to focus on dogmatic disputes, and it performed poorly in connecting with reality, transforming thinking, and improving research skills. Some technical researchers have not yet shed the burden of "researching for themselves," and they prefer to struggle on their own when problems arise. The spirit of collective problem-solving is lacking, and the monthly research meetings are not enthusiastic. The main reasons for this situation are: firstly, the leadership relationship of the union was not clear in the past, and the Executive Committee did not dare to work freely. For a period, it only maintained a relationship with the Fourth District Federation of Trade Unions office for paying membership fees. Secondly, the staffing of the Executive Committee was inappropriate. The laboratory has many technical personnel, but they accounted for a small proportion of the union's cadres. The union chairman was an administrative staff member who was not familiar with research work, making it difficult to promote research among technical personnel. Thirdly, the union's work was not closely coordinated with the administration. All matters related to research were handled solely by the administration, and the union only offered suggestions occasionally. At the beginning of this month, the union re-elected the third Executive Committee, and researcher Meng Guangjun was elected as chairman. The union has begun to pay attention to correcting past biases. The third Executive Committee's work plan specifically emphasizes cooperating with the administration to promote members' research work and strengthening political study, and it guarantees that public spare time production will be carried out. At the same time, the union has recently clarified that it is under the leadership of the Fourth District Federation of Trade Unions office, and the Executive Committee can now work freely.

### 工业试验所工会改选执委  注意推动业务研究  纠正只重福利偏向

　　工业试验所工会改选执委
    注意推动业务研究  纠正只重福利偏向
    【本报讯】北京工业试验所工会，过去偏重于福利工作，对加强会员政治学习做好研究业务工作重视不够；六月初改选执委后已注意纠正。该所工会成立已十五个月，会员多数为研究人员，但一、二届执委干部中研究人员占比例较小。过去工会对合作社、家属宿舍、勤杂人员夜校、贫困会员借钱等福利工作做得很好，但举办的理论学习多偏重于教条争执，在联系实际改造思想提高研究业务方面作得很差。个别技术研究人员还没有把“为自己研究”的包袱扔下，发现问题时宁愿自己硬钻，集体研究问题的精神还谈不上，每月一次的研究会也不热烈。造成这种情形的主要原因：第一是过去工会的领导关系不明确，执委会不敢放手工作，有一段时期仅和四区工会办事处保持交会费的关系。第二是执委会干部配备不当。该所技术人员多，但在工会干部中却占较小的比例，工会主席是事务工作人员，不熟习研究工作，很难推动技术人员研究业务。第三是工会工作与行政配合不够密切，一切有关研究业务都由行政方面单独去做，工会仅有时提提意见。本月初，工会改选第三届执委，研究员孟广俊被推选为主席。工会已开始注意纠正过去的偏向。第三届执委工作计划中特别强调了配合行政推动会员搞好研究工作及加强政治学习，并保证一定把公余生产搞起来。同时该所工会最近已明确规定由四区工会办事处领导，今后执委会已可放手工作。（鲁追）
