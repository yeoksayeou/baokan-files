　　Xihe County, Gansu Province, Inspects Public Grain Storage, Emphasizing Criticism of Coercive Commandism
    [Our Dispatch] Xihe County, Gansu Province, convened a joint meeting of district chiefs and CCP district committee secretaries on May 18 to inspect the work of public grain storage over the past month. In addition to summarizing the achievements (over 25,000 *shi* stored, accounting for 60% of the total), the meeting focused on criticizing the coercive commandist style in this work. According to reports, the most serious manifestations of coercive commandism in various districts were in three forms: First, the significance of public grain storage was not publicized, the masses were not mobilized, and cadres were simply running around urging collection. Some cadres even mistakenly believed that the people were not afraid of reasoning, so they demanded to carry guns to frighten the masses. Second, some cadres did not understand the public grain regulations, nor did they humbly and conscientiously study them. Therefore, they could not properly resolve the difficulties and questions raised by the masses, let alone raise the awareness and understanding of the masses. Third, due to simple urging, some people delayed payment, and the cadres believed that the people were deliberately causing trouble, and they would not work unless they were tough. Therefore, errors such as beating, tying up, and parading people through the streets occurred in some places.

    This coercive commandist style aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Farmers in Baojigou, Daliu Township, hid when district cadres came to urge grain collection. Farmers in some villages would give perfunctory responses to cadres, or offer bribes to request reductions or exemptions (mostly rejected by the cadres). Some even loaded the grain in front of the cadres, saying they were sending it to the warehouse, but turned a corner and went home, or sent it to relatives' homes, so it was still not stored. Some cadres did not realize that this phenomenon was caused by errors in their own work. Instead, they said that the masses were "backward" and "stubborn," and lost confidence in their work, saying, "There's no way, let's wait and see after the summer harvest!" "Who can educate the people all at once?", and so on.

    The meeting conducted a review and study in response to the above situation, clarifying that this was because the masses did not understand the policies.

    Finally, everyone agreed that coercive commandism not only failed to complete the task, but also increased the ideological concerns of the masses. The county party secretary solemnly pointed out in his summary that arbitrarily beating, tying up, and parading people through the streets were serious errors that violated policy, and that party members who made mistakes should be given appropriate punishment. He pointed out that the seriousness of coercive commandism was mainly due to insufficient guidance from the county's leading organs. For example, the phenomena of being too lenient or too harsh had not been fully corrected, and cadres who did not understand the policies acted simply and impatiently when the tasks were urgent. At the same time, because unfairness was discovered when deciding on public grain quotas, it was not corrected in a timely manner, but it was excused by saying that the correction would be made after the grain was collected and stored. To this end, the meeting decided that, according to the grain requisition policy, those who were truly unable to afford it or were overburdened could be reduced or exempted through the farmers' association, and those who were too lightly burdened should be increased, so as to make the burden fair and reasonable. Cadres should study the policies in depth and explain them to the masses; those who arbitrarily beat and tied up people should publicly apologize to the masses, admit their mistakes, and mobilize the masses to send grain as soon as possible.

### 甘肃西和县检查公粮入仓工作  着重批判强迫命令作风

　　甘肃西和县检查公粮入仓工作
    着重批判强迫命令作风
    【本报讯】甘肃西和县于五月十八日召开区长和中共区委书记联席会议，检查一月来公粮入仓等工作。会上除总结了成绩（入仓二万五千余石，占总额百分之六十）外，着重批判了此次工作中的强迫命令作风。根据汇报，各区强迫命令作风表现最严重的有三种形式：第一、不宣传公粮入仓意义，没发动群众，只是干部到处跑着催，甚至有些干部错误地认为，老百姓不怕说理，所以要求背上枪以使群众害怕。第二、部分干部不懂公粮条例，也不虚心认真的学习，因而对群众提出的困难和疑问不能适当解决，更不能提高群众的觉悟与认识。第三、由于单纯催缴，致有些人拖延不缴，而干部却认为老百姓挑皮捣蛋，不硬一点不行，故有个别地方曾发生打人绑人游街等错误。
    这种强迫命令的作风引起群众很大的不满。大柳乡保鸡沟农民，见到区干部来催粮，男人们就都躲起来了。还有部分村庄的农民，见了干部就应付，或者送钱行贿要求减免（多被干部拒绝）。更有的当着干部的面前把粮装上说给仓库送，但转一个弯就又折回家，有的寄到亲戚家去，结果仍未入仓。部分干部对于这种现象，不但没有认识到是自己工作中的错误所造成，反而说群众“落后”“顽固”，并且丧失工作信心，都说：“没办法，等夏收后再看吧！”“谁能把老百姓一下教育好呢？”，等等。
    会上针对上述情况，进行检讨、研究，明确了这是因为群众不了解政策所致。
    最后，大家认为强迫命令不仅完不成任务，反而增加了群众的思想顾虑。县委书记在总结时严肃的指出随便打人捆人游街是违反政策的严重错误，对犯错误的党员同志应分别给予处分。并指出，强迫命令的所以严重，主要是因为县的领导机关指导不够。如畸轻畸重现象未全部纠正，干部不懂政策，任务紧急时就简单急燥的行动起来；同时因决定公粮时已发现有不公之处，也未及时纠正，却借口先催缴入仓后再结算纠正。为此，会议决定：根据征粮政策，如确有不能负担或负担过重者，可通过农会减免，并给太轻者增加，作到负担公平合理。干部应深入学习政策，好好的向群众宣传解释；随便打人绑人的应向群众公开道歉，承认错误，并发动群众尽速送粮。
