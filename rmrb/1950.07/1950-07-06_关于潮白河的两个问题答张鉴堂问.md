　　Two Questions About the Chao River
    Answering Zhang Jiantang's Questions

To the Editor:
    The "People's Garden" of June 12th published information regarding the water conservancy issues of the lower reaches of the Chao River. I now have two questions and hope for answers:
    1. Before the completion of this new river, approximately how many villages in Baodi County would be unable to engage in agricultural production within a year or two?
    2. How will the People's Government resettle the refugees who are unable to engage in agricultural production?

Zhang Jiantang

Comrade Zhang Jiantang:
    Your questions have been answered by the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau as follows:
    According to the explanation in the "Opinions on the Chao River Downstream Regulation Project," after the completion of the entire river project, part of the floodwater can be discharged into the sea via the Dongyin River, and the remaining part will be stored in the Huangzhuangwa, Dongdian, Ditou, and Qilihai reservoirs. Within Baodi County, only the new river channel and the Huangzhuangwa and Dongdian areas will be unsuitable for cultivation (but three months after the flood season, the滩地 of the new river channel and part of Dongdian can still be used for production).
    The project undertaken this year is only part of the entire project. The Huangzhuangwa and Dongdian reservoirs have not been surrounded by dikes. If a flood flow of 3,000 cubic meters per second, such as that in 1922, is encountered, the flooded area in Baodi will be larger than after the completion of the entire project. The flooded area will roughly extend southwest to the county boundary, east to the old course of the Jian'gan River, and north to the area around Bataigang, Xibeizhuang, Pangqiaotou, and Xihulu villages, including approximately 250 to 260 villages. However, three months after the flood season, due to the continuous discharge of the Dongyin River, most of the flooded areas can be drained, with only 50 to 60 villages in the low-lying Huangzhuangwa area unable to completely drain the accumulated water.
    Regarding the resettlement of refugees, the bureau raised the issue for discussion at the Chao River Project Conference held on March 8th and determined in principle that farmers who cannot engage in production due to flooding will be given appropriate resettlement and care by the government. The Hebei Provincial Government is currently meeting to discuss this matter.

### 关于潮白河的两个问题答张鉴堂问

　　关于潮白河的两个问题
    答张鉴堂问编辑同志：
    六月十二日人民园地登载关于潮白河下流水利问题。我现在有两个问题，希解答：
    一、这条新河完成前，宝坻县大约有多少村在一、二年内不能从事农业生产？
    二、对于不能从事农业生产的难民，人民政府将如何安置？
    张鉴堂张鉴堂同志：
    你的问题由华北水利工程局解答如下：
    按照整理潮白河下游工程意见书的说明，该河全部工程完成后，洪水的一部分可经由东引河下泄入海，其余的一部分则分储于黄庄洼、东淀、堤头、七里海等蓄水池内。在宝坻县境内，只有新河道及黄庄洼与东淀地带不能从事耕作（但在汛期过后三个月，新河道滩地及东淀部分地方仍可进行生产）。
    本年所做的工程，只是全部工程的一部分。黄庄洼及东淀等蓄水地亦未筑围堤。如遇到像一九二二年的三千秒立方公尺的洪水流量，则宝坻被淹的面积比全部工程完成后要大些，其侵水范围大致西南到县界，东至箭杆河故道，北至八台港、西北庄、庞桥头、西户露等村一带，包括的村子约有二百五六十个。但在汛后三个月，由于东引河的不断下泄，被淹的地方可大半脱出，仅黄庄洼一带低下的地方，有五六十个村子积水不能脱尽。
    关于如何安置难民问题，本局曾在三月八号召开潮白河工程会议时提出讨论，并在原则上确定：因为水淹不能从事生产的农民，将由政府予以适当安置与照顾。现河北省府已在开会商讨中。
