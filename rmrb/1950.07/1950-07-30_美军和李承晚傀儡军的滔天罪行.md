　　Heinous Crimes of the US Military and the Syngman Rhee Puppet Army

　　Editor's Note: US "Ambassador" to "South Korea," Muccio, directed the US military and South Korean puppet police to massacre over a thousand innocent Korean people before fleeing Suwon. When the US military retreated from Seoul to Incheon, they used machine guns to clear the way and robbed dozens of cars of Korean people's property. These are the actions of beasts! The following two reports, translated from the Pyongyang "Rodong Sinmun" and "Democratic Korea," depict the shameless behavior of American imperialism.

　　(I)

　　[Dispatch from this newspaper] According to the Pyongyang "Rodong Sinmun" of July 22:

　　South Korean "Korea Communications Agency" reporter stationed in Suwon, Shen Dayou (transliteration), and "Aixiang News" editor-in-chief Zhao Xiangguo (transliteration), served as embedded reporters with the "National Defense Army" from June 27 to July 4. They spoke of the crimes of the Syngman Rhee gang in Suwon as follows:

　　On June 27, Suwon City fell into a state of great chaos. That morning, the puppet government's vampires, Zhao Bingyu, Shen Yixuan, Zhang Zesheng, Lin Bingji, Cai Bingde, etc., passed through Suwon on their way to Daejeon, their cars laden with furniture, utensils, and even dogs. Upon arriving in Suwon, they stayed at Suwon Agricultural University, while the US military advisory group, the "United Nations Commission on Korea," and the "US Ambassador" Muccio's party stayed at the Suwon Agricultural Experiment Station. However, in the afternoon they were forced to retreat again. After the defeated wolves looted the granary, they began to massacre the people. The military police headquarters forcibly dragged away many women who had already been investigated to "comfort" the "National Defense Army," and those who refused were shot. The police were murderous, searching everywhere for targets to shoot. This crime by the US military and puppet police aroused extreme hatred and anger among the citizens.

　　More than thirty patriots imprisoned in the Suwon police station were machine-gunned to death. The massacre was carried out under the command of the Americans, led by US Ambassador Muccio. Over a thousand innocent workers, farmers, men, women, old and young were executed. When the People's Army liberated Suwon, the people of Suwon were so excited that they shed tears of joy.

　　(II)

　　[Dispatch from this newspaper] According to the Pyongyang "Democratic Korea" of July 17:

　　The American imperialist bandits and the executioners of the so-called "National Defense Army" massacred thousands of patriotic people and innocent civilians on the eve of the liberation of Incheon.

　　The murderous gangsters went on a final rampage in Incheon - a vampire-like bestial slaughter of the people, continuing from 1:00 PM on June 29 to 11:30 PM on July 3.

　　These executioners massacred people in large numbers, mainly on the coasts of Wolmido, Songdo, and Palmi Island.

　　After the liberation of Incheon on July 3, countless corpses of the tortured and murdered were discovered on Wolmido and other islands, on the coast, and in the streets. They were all teenagers, infants, the elderly, and young men and women.

　　Many young men and women were found with handcuffs still on their wrists; the bodies of the elderly were found in groups of five or ten, bound together with hemp ropes; the bodies of teenagers had hemp ropes tightly tied around their necks, with a single rope connecting ten to twenty-two necks in a row.

　　The corpses of adorable and innocent infants were even found inside straw sacks. Each straw sack contained from five to thirteen infants. In order to carry out the most cruel and outrageous slaughter, these murderous beasts mobilized all their vampires - the Naval Intelligence Office, the Army Intelligence Office, the police, the military police, and the lackeys of the so-called "National Defense Army," as well as members of the so-called Korean Youth Corps, and other hooligans and scum.

　　This unprecedented - and extremely brutal - massacre was witnessed by honest and straightforward citizens of Incheon, and is absolutely true.

　　On the 29th, after the US military thugs, terrified and fleeing to Incheon after the liberation of Seoul on the 28th, appeared in front of the city hall in two large trucks and a small jeep; they fired heavy machine guns and rifles wildly at the streets and charged forward, followed by a convoy of trucks, filled with members of the so-called "National Defense Army" and C.I.C.

　　The thugs set up machine guns on the streets, pointed pistols at people's chests, and carried out house-to-house arrests. Using only "suspicion" as an excuse, they handcuffed and roped up innocent people.

　　Countless citizens who were arrested were dragged to Wolmido, and those who resisted were shot on the spot.

　　On the night of June 29, the truth became even clearer thanks to the account of Kim Jin-bok (transliteration), a fourteen-year-old girl who narrowly escaped from the thugs' slaughterhouse.

　　The family of Quan Yongkui (transliteration), who lived at 126 Inner District, Incheon, were all killed at sea off Wolmido, leaving only his third daughter. She described the tragic scene at the time, saying:

　　At ten o'clock at night, six members of the so-called "National Defense Army" and police rushed into the girl's house, threatening her to find her father and brother. Afterward, they forced her entire family of six, including her eighty-three-year-old grandmother, her mother, her twenty-one-year-old sister, and two younger brothers, into a car and sped towards the sea. They were all killed at sea off Wolmido. When they were leaving home, the thugs asked, "Do you have any money?" "Isn't that ring gold?" However, her mother replied, "We have no money, the ring is copper."

　　On a ship anchored off the coast of Wolmido - on that murderous pirate ship, the girl witnessed US military bandits' bags full of hundreds of rings, watches, and fountain pens. Her sister was dragged into another small cabin.

　　She also said: "That night, the thugs tied up the people who were already handcuffed with hemp ropes; when infants cried, the thugs found it annoying and threw them into the sea."

　　"My younger brother, Jin Tai (six years old) (transliteration) and Pearl (transliteration) were stabbed to death with bayonets!"

　　Besides these, the girl couldn't remember anything else, only that she was rescued by a rescue ship afterward.

　　The fact that US military bandits used dozens of trucks to transport the citizens' property they had robbed to Wolmido was witnessed by all the citizens.

　　The heroic People's Army's fierce attack has completely opened up this appalling Incheon scandal, and the bright and cheerful Greater Incheon has now embarked on a new life.

　　The city is being rebuilt, and all the people are firmly united around the People's Committee, resolutely moving towards the light.

　　Thousands of young people in the city, to avenge their unforgettable deep hatred and to repay the blood debt of their flesh and blood, have volunteered to join the army to kill the enemy.

　　This is how the citizens of Incheon are responding to the enemy's atrocities.

### 美军和李承晚傀儡军的滔天罪行

　　美军和李承晚傀儡军的滔天罪行
    编者按：美国驻“南朝鲜”的“大使”缪锡俄，在逃出水原前，指挥着美军和南朝鲜伪军警，屠杀了千余无辜的朝鲜人民；美军自汉城逃往仁川时，用机关枪扫射着开路，并抢劫了数十汽车朝鲜人民的财物。这是野兽的行径！下面两篇译自平壤《劳动新闻》及《民主朝鲜》的报道，刻划出了美国帝国主义的无耻的行为。
    （一）
    【本报讯】据七月二十二日平壤《劳动新闻》载称：
    南朝鲜的“韩国通讯社”驻水原记者沈大佑（译音）和《爱乡新闻》主编赵相国（译音）在六月二十七日到七月四日做了“国防军”的随军记者，他们谈了李承晚匪帮在水原的罪行如下：
    六月二十七日，水原市陷入了大混乱的状态。这天上午，傀儡政府的吸血鬼们，赵炳玉、申翼熙、张泽相、林炳稷、蔡秉德等，在向大田逃跑途中路经水原，他们的汽车上满载了家具器物甚至于狗。到了水原，他们住在水原农业大学，美军军事顾问团、“联合国朝鲜委员会”、和“美大使”缪锡俄一行人等则住在水原农事实验场。但在下午他们又被迫退却。败退的狼群抢分了粮库后，又开始屠杀人民。宪兵司令部将业已调查好的许多妇女强行拖走去“慰问”“国防军”，其中表示拒绝的妇女们都被枪杀了。警察们杀气腾腾地到处寻找枪杀的对象。美军和伪警的这一罪行引起了市民们极端的憎恨和愤怒。
    监禁在水原警察署的三十多位爱国者都被机关枪扫射而死了。屠杀是在以美大使缪锡俄为首的美国人指挥下进行的，被枪决了的无辜的工、农，男女老幼在一千人以上。水原被人民军解放时，水原市的人民兴奋得流出欢欣的眼泪。
    （二）
    【本报讯】据七月十七日平壤《民主朝鲜》载称：
    美国帝国主义强盗和所谓“国防军”的刽子手们，在仁川解放的前夜，屠杀了千余爱国志士和无辜人民。
    杀人强盗们在仁川最后发狂——吸血鬼般的屠戮人民的兽行，从六月二十九日午后一时继续到七月三日的夜半十一点。
    那些刽子手们大批地杀害人民，主要是在月尾岛、松岛、八尾岛等海岸上执行的。
    七月三日，仁川解放后，在月尾岛等岛屿、在海岸、在街头，连日发现了无数的被虐杀的尸体，都是些少年、婴儿、老者和青年男女。
    有很多青年男女的尸体，还扣着手镣；老者们的尸首是五具或十具在一起，用麻绳捆着；少年们的死尸，是用麻绳紧勒着脖子，用一条绳子一连串的勒着十个到二十二个的脖颈。
    可爱天真的婴儿尸体竟发现在草袋子里边。每一个草袋里装着五个以上到十三个。这些杀人的野兽们为了肆行残忍透顶的杀戮，把它们的吸血鬼——海军情报处、陆军情报处、警察、宪兵和所谓“国防军”及其狗腿所谓大韩青年团员，还有其他的流氓败类全都动员起来了。
    这种亘古未闻的——残忍绝伦的屠杀行为，由于诚实直爽的仁川市民们的亲眼目睹，是千真万确的。
    二十八日，汉城解放后，惊惶失措抱头鼠窜到仁川来的美军暴徒们，于二十九日，分乘在两辆大卡车和一辆小吉普上，出现在市府前面；猛向市街横射着重机、步枪，向前冲进，后面紧跟着成队的载重汽车，那上面满乘着所谓“国防军”和Ｃ·Ｉ·Ｃ的分子。
    暴徒们把机枪架在大街上，拿着手枪对准人们的胸膛，实行按户拘捕。只用“可疑”为借口，竟把善良的人们扣上手镣，还用绳索绑上。
    这些被捕的无数市民，都被拉向月尾岛，间有抗拒的，就地就被枪毙。
    在六月二十九的夜里，由于从暴徒们的杀人屠场，九死一生的跑回来的十四岁少女金珍福（译音）的诉说，使这些真象更加明确。
    住在仁川市内区一二六号的全永奎（译音）的全家，都在月尾岛的海上被杀，只剩下他的第三个女孩，她叙述着当时的惨状说：
    夜晚十时的时候，有所谓“国防军”和警察六名，冲入少女家里，威吓她找出她的爸爸和哥哥。以后即把他们全家六口，全押在汽车上，向海边奔驰。八十三岁的祖母，还有母亲和二十一岁的姐姐、两个小弟弟都在内。他们都在月尾岛的海上被杀掉了。他们临从家里走的时候，暴徒们还问过：“你们有钱没有？”，“那个戒指不是金的吗？”可是，母亲回答了说：“钱也没有，戒指是铜的。”
    在停泊于月尾岛海上的船上——在那屠杀人命的贼船上，少女目睹了美军强盗们的皮包里，满装着成百的戒指、手表和自来水笔。她的姐姐被拉到另一个小舱里。
    她又说：“那天夜里，暴徒们把已经扣上手镣的人们，再用麻绳绑着；正在哭着的婴孩，暴徒们认为讨厌，就把他们扔到海里。”
    “我的弟弟珍泰（六岁）（译音）和珍珠（译音）被他们用刺刀扎死啦！”
    除了这些以外，少女什么也记不得了，只记得在那以后，被只救护船救出来而已。
    美军强盗们，把抢来的市民财物，用数十辆载重汽车飞奔的运往月尾岛的这件事实，任何市民都所亲眼目睹了的。
    英勇人民军的猛击进攻，才把这令人发指的仁川黑幕豁然打开，明朗快活的大仁川，现已走上了新生之途。
    市街正在修建，所有的人民都巩固的团结在人民委员会的周围，坚毅地走向光明。
    市内的数千青年，为雪去永远也忘不了的深仇、为了偿还他们骨肉的血债，蜂起志愿参军杀敌。
    对于敌人们的兽行，仁川市民是这样回答着。
                  （容译自七月十七日《民主朝鲜》）
