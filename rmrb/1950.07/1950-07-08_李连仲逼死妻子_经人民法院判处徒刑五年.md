　　Oppose the Criminal Acts of Harming Women!
    Li Lianzhong Forces Wife to Death
    Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment by People's Court

Editor Comrade:

　　Li Lianzhong, an accountant at the North China People's Government Material Clearing Office, played with women and forced his wife to death. He has been punished by law.
　　Around the first month of the lunar calendar this year, he was introduced to Zhang Shuzhen of Tonglin Pavilion Road in this city and began to correspond with her. In late March, Zhang Shuzhen went to the Material Clearing Office to find him. Because there was no one in the room at the time, Li induced and raped her, and later raped her twice more.
　　On April 2nd, they formally married at Shanglinchun. That night, after sharing a room, he shamelessly used the excuse that Zhang Shuzhen was no longer a virgin, insisting that Zhang Shuzhen had had physical relations with someone else. Finally, he said to her: "We should get a divorce. I can introduce a friend to marry you." On the evening of April 17th, he firmly demanded a divorce again. Zhang, left with no choice, pleaded with him, but he turned his face away and ignored her. She had no choice but to return to her mother's home and tell her brothers and sisters-in-law about her husband's request for a divorce. That afternoon, her brother Zhang Yanfeng accompanied her home to reason with Li Lianzhong, and told him, "Shuzhen hasn't eaten for two days and wants to buy poison (to commit suicide)." Not only did he not change his mind, but he replied ruthlessly, "Does she want to drink poison at home? I'm going to work, and no one will be home. You will be responsible if something happens." Zhang Yanfeng requested that the introducer come forward to resolve the matter, but Li Lianzhong said, "The matchmaker doesn't have time to bother with you." He also instructed the introducer: "If the Zhang family comes to you, don't get involved." That night, Zhang Shuzhen made dinner for him, but he ate it alone and ignored her.
　　On the evening of April 20th, he brought up the matter of divorce again. She knelt on the ground and begged him, but he still ignored her. The next day, he applied to the local police station for a divorce. After understanding the matter, the police station criticized his erroneous views. However, he did not wake up and stubbornly stuck to his own views. Finally, Zhang Shuzhen saw that he was determined to divorce and, being from a feudal family with no way out, hanged herself at 11:00 a.m. on the 22nd while the defendant was at work.
　　After she hanged herself, her father filed a complaint with the People's Court on May 3rd. The Beijing Municipal People's Court detained Li Lianzhong for education. However, Li showed no remorse and repeatedly argued, "I filed for divorce because Zhang Shuzhen wanted to kill me." But the facts prove that Zhang Shuzhen did not show any intention of harming him until she hanged herself. In order to warn against such criminal acts of harming women, the People's Court sentenced Li Lianzhong to five years in prison on June 17th.

　　反对残害妇女的罪恶行为！
    李连仲逼死妻子
    经人民法院判处徒刑五年编者同志：
    华北人民政府物资清理处会计员李连仲，玩弄女性，逼死妻子。已受到法律处分。
    今年旧历正月间，他经人介绍与本市佟麟阁路张淑贞认识后，不断通信。三月下旬，张淑贞到物资清理处找他，因当时室内无人，即被李诱奸，以后又曾被奸二次。
    四月二日，他们在上林春正式结婚。当晚同房后，他无耻地以张淑贞已非处女为借口，硬说张淑贞与别人发生过肉体关系。最后他对她说：“我们离婚好了，我可以介绍一个朋友和你结婚。”四月十七日晚，他又坚决要离婚。张被逼无奈，苦苦央求他，可是他背过脸去，置之不理。她只好回到娘家，把丈夫要求离婚事告诉她的兄嫂。当天下午她哥哥张彦峰即陪她回家，向李连仲论理，并告诉他说：“淑贞已两天没有吃饭，要买药水（自杀）。”他不但毫不转心，反而无情地回答说：“她在家要喝药水吗？我上班去，屋里没人，出了事情你要负责。”张彦峰提出要求介绍人出面解决此事，李连仲却说：“媒人没有工夫和你找麻烦。”并到介绍人处布置说：“张家如果找你，不要参与这事。”当晚，张淑贞替他做好了饭，他却独自吃了，并不理她。
    四月二十日晚，他又提出离婚事。她就跪在地上哀求他，但他仍不理睬。第二天他就向当地派出所要求离婚，派出所了解此事后，对他的错误观点进行了批评。但他毫不省悟，仍旧固执己见。最后张淑贞见他离意坚决，本身又出身封建家庭，苦无出路，就在二十二日上午十一时，趁被告上班之际自缢身死。
    她自缢后，她的父亲于五月三日向人民法院具状声诉。京市人民法院将李连仲羁押予以教育。但李丝毫不知悔罪，并一再狡辩说：“我提出离婚是因为张淑贞要杀我。”但事实证明，张淑贞直到自缢身死前，并无任何意欲谋害他的表现。人民法院为了警戒此种残害女性的罪恶行为，于六月十七日判处李连仲五年徒刑。
