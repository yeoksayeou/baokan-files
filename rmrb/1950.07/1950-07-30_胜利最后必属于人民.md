　　Victory Will Ultimately Belong to the People
　　Tao Menghe
　　The United States is the most ferocious imperialist country in the world today. It has the ambition to annex the entire world, and it has a plan to extinguish all progressive forces. To carry out this purpose, it has already implemented the Marshall Plan in Europe and established the Atlantic Pact. To carry out this purpose, it launched an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Asia. Its offensive has been defeated, and Truman has revealed his long-planned plan: he announced armed aggression against Korea, armed aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan, and accelerated military assistance to the Philippine puppet government and the French and Bao Dai troops in Indochina. This is a arrogant and shameless offensive by U.S. imperialism against nations striving for freedom and independence and loving peace. Taiwan is our territory, and it goes without saying that we should use all our strength to drive U.S. imperialism and its puppet Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang out of Taiwan. Korea is our close neighbor, and its heroic struggle today is just like the struggle we ourselves have experienced in the past two or three years. We place unlimited hope in its victory in terms of interests and morality. We have every reason to believe that U.S. imperialism's undeniable armed aggression in the East is bound to fail. Victory will ultimately belong to Korea and all nations seeking freedom, independence, and peace.

　　胜利最后必属于人民
    陶孟和
    美国是今天世界上最凶狠的帝国主义国家，它有并吞全世界的企图，它有扑灭一切进步力量的计划。为进行这个目的，它在欧洲已经推行了马歇尔计划，成立了大西洋公约。为进行这个目的，它在亚洲便发动向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻。它的进攻遭到了失败，杜鲁门便把它蓄意已久的计划揭穿：它宣布武力侵略朝鲜，武力侵略我国台湾领土，加速对菲律宾傀儡政府和印度支那的法国及保大的部队的军事援助等一连串的举动，这是美帝国主义向争取自由独立爱好和平的民族的一个狂妄的无耻的进攻。台湾是我们的领土，我们应该用我们的全力将美帝国主义和它的傀儡蒋介石匪帮逐出台湾自不待言。朝鲜是我们的近邻，它今天的英勇的奋斗正如我们自己两三年来所经历的斗争一样。我们在利害上，在道义上，对于它的胜利寄以无限的希望。我们有种种理由可以相信：美帝国主义的无可辩解的武力侵略东方必然失败。胜利最后必属于朝鲜和一切争求自由独立与爱好和平的民族。
