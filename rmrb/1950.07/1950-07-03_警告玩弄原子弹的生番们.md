　　Warning to the Savages Who Play with the Atomic Bomb
    Situ Meitang
    The Chinese people deeply love peace, because only peace can bring us prosperity and happiness. But the Chinese people are a people who dare to struggle. If the savages who play with the atomic bomb want to create a war of aggression, we will certainly be able to eliminate them! The tragic end of the Hitler bandit gang can serve as a warning.

　　警告玩弄原子弹的生番们
    司徒美堂
    中国人民酷爱和平，因为只有和平，才能给我们带来繁荣与幸福。但中国人民是敢于斗争的人民，玩弄原子弹的生番们如果要制造侵略战争，我们一定能够把它消灭！希特勒匪帮的悲惨结局，可为殷鉴。
