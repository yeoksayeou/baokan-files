　　Many Private Schools in Xiyang County, Shanxi,
    Combine Cultural Learning with Production Education
    Private Schools such as those in Zhaobi Village Have Played a Good Role in Improving Agricultural Production
    [Our Newspaper] Correspondent Hao Jinrui reported: Since the end of the winter school movement in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province at the end of March, more than 80% of the villages that ran winter schools have converted to year-round private schools. Over the past three months, many private schools have achieved significant results. For example, the private schools in villages such as Zhaobi, Wangzhai, Baiyangyu, and Fengju, in addition to carrying out cultural education, have also conducted ideological education and production education in line with the agricultural activities of each period, playing a role in promoting the development of agricultural production. Many district and village cadres have a new understanding of private schools and can combine leading production with leading learning well. For example, Zhang Lanchang, the village chief of Wangzhai Village in the Seventh District, said, "Private schools are a weapon for doing a good job in central work. The mobilization of our village's work relies entirely on private schools."
    In the preparation stage for spring plowing, these villages first conducted education in the private schools on the goal of exceeding the pre-war production level by 10% this year, mobilizing farmers to process fertilizer, apply manure, and engage in intensive farming. During plowing, many farmers had concerns. For example, in Wangzhai Village in the Seventh District, some farmers were afraid that plowing would result in "poor soil moisture and inability to withstand drought" because the soil contained pebbles. The private school launched a fierce debate and discussion among the students, and finally everyone realized that "If you want to grow more grain, you have to work harder and plow more. You can't mistakenly add salt to the sauce jar," "The more you plow the land, the better it is. There are many stones in our place, and it is not drought-resistant, so we must pay attention to technology. Plow shallower to retain moisture. When sowing, it is best to sow on moist soil." Five days later, the village plowed 700 mu of land, accounting for two-thirds of the land that should be plowed. Fengju Village in the Third District is close to the coal mine and does not lack charcoal. When the private school talked about burning grain stubble to remove insect eggs, everyone generally did not believe it. Wang Menglin (labor hero), a production teacher at the private school, took the grain stubble from the field back to the private school for everyone to see for themselves. After explaining, all the grain stubble in the village was dug back and burned. The cooperative in Huangyan Village in the Third District bought 40 jin of red alum for insect control, but the farmers complained that the price was too expensive and said that the red alum for insect control was useless. After the private school teacher explained the insecticidal agent teaching materials compiled by the county agricultural science department, they mixed the red alum with red-hot ashes and hot-cooked rice and fed it to the walnut worms, and the worms died. Only when the farmers saw it with their own eyes did they rush to buy it from the cooperative. When the private school in Dawaqiu Village in the Fourth District discussed soaking seeds in warm water, the farmers had two concerns: one was that they were afraid of scalding the seeds to death, and the other was that they were afraid of the trouble and did not want to soak them. Student Qin Fuchang said, "The bean sprouts we eat are grown on hot pits, but they are not scalded to death." Wang Ying said, "I used two bowls of boiling water and one bowl of cold water to experiment in the pot, and they sprouted in three and a half days. Those that were not soaked took five days." Someone also explained the principle that soaking seeds in warm water can kill bacteria. Everyone believed it, and 90% of the families in the village had soaked their seeds. When Jinyang Village in the Fourth District mobilized people to plant trees, some said that it was difficult because there were no saplings; others said that even if there were saplings, they would not survive. After studying and discussing in the private school, it was decided that the households with trees and those who could cut them would first get the saplings, and the tree planting households would reciprocate; they also invited a tree planting expert to talk about the techniques. Everyone's thoughts were cleared, and the entire village planted an average of four trees per person. When Wangzhai Village in the Seventh District discussed the benefits of planting cotton in the private school (in the past, the village used to grow and weave their own cotton, and did not grow much), they used accounting methods to clarify that planting cotton was more profitable, one mu could top five mu of corn, and the entire village planted 300 mu more cotton than last year. These examples have educated the village cadres in some areas with poor work foundations and made them realize that the saying "When production is busy, we can't take care of running private schools" is wrong. The masses also believe that "There are benefits to attending private schools," so the private schools in various places have gradually consolidated.
    After summarizing the spring plowing work, all districts in Xiyang County held propaganda and education meetings at the district level, exchanged experiences in running private schools in various villages, and determined the content of production education currently being carried out, such as summer hoeing, summer harvesting, and topdressing. Some village cadres or villagers reflected that running such a private school has touched our hearts.

　　山西昔阳县许多民校
    结合文化学习进行生产教育
    赵壁村等民校对提高农业生产起了很好作用
    【本报讯】通讯员郝晋瑞报道：山西省昔阳县自三月底结束冬学运动后，百分之八十以上办有冬学的村庄，都转设了常年民校。三个月来，许多民校已获得显著的成绩。如赵壁、王寨、白羊峪、凤居等村的民校，除了进行文化教育之外，并随着各时期的农事活动，进行了思想教育和生产教育，对发展农业生产起了推动作用。许多区村干部对民校有了新的认识，能把领导生产与领导学习很好地结合起来。如七区王寨村长张兰昌说：“民校是搞好中心工作的武器，我村工作的发动，全靠民校。”
    在准备春耕阶段，这些村庄首先在民校里进行了贯彻今年超过战前生产水平百分之十的奋斗目标的教育，发动农民加工、加粪、精耕细作。在翻地时，不少农民有顾虑，如七区王寨村因土壤里有石头子，有的农民怕翻了地“墒不好，不耐旱”。民校里就发动学员展开了激烈的争辩讨论，最后大家认识到“要想多打粮，就得多下工，多翻地。酱瓮里错撒不了盐”，“地是越翻越好。咱这地方石粒多，不耐旱，更得讲究技术。翻得浅些，能养墒。下种时，正好种在湿土上”。五天后，全村翻地七百亩，占全村应翻地的三分之二。三区凤居村离煤窑近，不缺炭烧。在民校讲了除虫卵要烧谷楂，大家普遍不相信。民校生产教师王梦林（劳动英雄）就到地里拿回谷楂在民校里让大家亲自看。经过讲解后，全村的谷楂都刨回来烧了。三区黄岩村合作社买了杀虫红矾四十斤，农民嫌价钱太贵说杀虫红矾不顶事。民校教师讲解了县农业科编印的杀虫药剂教材后，又用红热灰和热捞饭拌了红矾，喂给核桃虫吃，这虫果然死了。农民亲眼见了，才争着到合作社购买。四区大瓦邱村民校讨论温汤浸种时，农民有两种顾虑：一种是怕烫死，一种是怕麻烦，不愿浸。学员秦富长说：“咱吃的豆芽，就是在热坑上生的，可没烫死。”王英说：“我是用二碗开水，一碗冷水，在锅里实验，三天半就出芽了。没浸的得五天。”又有人解释了温汤浸种能杀菌的道理。大家都相信了，全村有百分之九十的人家浸过种。四区晋阳村发动植树时，有人说没有树秧很困难；有人说有秧也栽不活。大家在民校研究、讨论之后，决定由有树的家户与会砍的人先弄来树秧，植树户还工；又请了一名栽树能手讲了技术。大家的思想搞通了，全村每人平均植了四株树。七区王寨村在民校讨论种棉花好处时（过去该村都是自种自织，不多种），用算账的办法，弄清种棉得利大，一亩能顶种五亩玉茭，全村较去年多植棉三百亩。这一些实例，教育了一些工作基础较差的地区的村干部，认识了“生产忙，顾不上办民校”的说法是错误的。群众也认为“上民校有好处”，因此，各地民校逐渐巩固了。
    春耕工作总结之后，昔阳全县各区都以区为单位召开了宣教会议，交流了各村办民校的经验，确定了目前正在开展的夏锄、夏收、上追肥等生产教育的内容。有的村干部或村民反映说，办成这样的民校，就碰了咱们的心了。
