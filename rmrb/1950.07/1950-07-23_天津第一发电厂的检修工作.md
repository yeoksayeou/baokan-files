　　Overhaul Work at Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant
    Our Correspondent Jian Qing
    The administrative leadership of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's No. 1 Power Plant has established the idea of relying on the working class and gradually overcome purely technical viewpoints, thereby continuously improving the plant's production efficiency. After four major overhauls from August of last year to June of this year, the old machines have fully exerted their due effectiveness, and the power generation capacity has been significantly improved. As a result, the load has increased from 22,000 kilowatts to 27,000 kilowatts, and coal consumption has decreased from 0.8 kilograms to 0.5367 kilograms (the bureau's standard is 0.5 kilograms per kilowatt-hour), and steam consumption per kilowatt-hour has decreased from 5.18 kilograms to below 4.88 kilograms. This has reduced costs, ensured safe operation, and fully supplied Tianjin's industrial electricity needs.

    The plant has 197 employees and is equipped with modern machinery. The power generation equipment has a maximum load capacity of 30,000 kilowatts and is an important part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid. The Tianjin Steel Plant, various Zhongfang factories, rubber, paper mills, and other factories are all powered by it, making it the heart of Tianjin's industrial power.

    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to corrupt and incompetent management, there were never any regular overhauls, which caused frequent machine failures. The citizens called the power plant the "Darkness Company." In the early days of liberation, the plant sometimes experienced power outages due to failures. In order to restore equipment effectiveness and ensure safe power transmission, the plant proposed a basic method of implementing regular overhauls in July of last year. However, at that time, technical personnel and some employees held purely technical viewpoints, believing that it could only be achieved by adding new equipment or reducing output. To overcome this outdated and erroneous viewpoint, leading cadres held various meetings to mobilize and deliberate, pointing out the benefits of overhauls and that relying on the creative ability of the workers could overcome difficulties. One month before the construction, the administrative leadership made a thorough overhaul plan. This plan included the organization of labor, the preparation of materials and tools, and the formulation of work progress, etc. After discussion by the factory management committee, it was submitted to the trade union, the Party, and the Communist Youth League group meetings for discussion, and implemented after modifications based on the workers' opinions.

    The overhaul work officially started on August 8th of last year, with a plan to complete the overhaul of Boiler No. 2 and Steam Engine No. 1 within twenty days. In the initial stage, purely technical viewpoints and the conservative thinking of each acting on their own still hindered the progress of the work. This was reflected in the fact that some technical personnel were still accustomed to sitting in the office making plans, unwilling to combine with the workers who actually operated the equipment, and belittling the strength of the workers. It was still impossible to transfer people between departments, and it was necessary to hire outside workers and work overtime. In response to this thinking, the leading cadres conducted timely education, pointing out that it was necessary to rely on unity and mutual assistance and establish an overall concept to successfully complete the overhaul task. They united the advanced elements among the workers as the backbone, giving play to their enthusiasm for labor and creativity, and leading the general workers to move forward, thus gradually dispelling these obstacles. Under the intense labor of the workers, the overhaul task was completed in only fourteen days. Workers Yu Zhaozhang and his brother Han Jiaxiang of the steam engine team painstakingly researched and self-made eleven steam nozzles with substitutes, replaced them on Steam Engine No. 1, and reduced steam consumption by 5%. The engineer specializing in BBC steam engines from Shanghai Xintong Company was extremely surprised when he heard the news and made a special trip to the factory to visit. Labor model Jia Maosheng worked hard regardless of wind and rain, creating a new record of manufacturing one hundred and twenty dry steam pipes with connecting rods in fourteen days. Water pump repair worker Shen Lan completed the boiler repair work that required one week during the enemy and puppet period in twenty-two hours, ensuring safe power transmission. When overhauling Boiler No. 1, the workers studied and used wind steel to transform it into three washing knife blades to clean off the four-point thick hard scale. In addition, the motor team, the repair team, and the coal platform also created brilliant achievements. The leading cadres promptly summarized and announced the achievements, commended and rewarded labor models, and encouraged work enthusiasm.

    The second overhaul was carried out in December of last year, originally planned to complete the overhaul of Boiler No. 2 in fourteen days. As a result, it was completed in only seven days, half the time ahead of August. During the two overhauls, fifty-two labor models such as Yu Zhaozhang and Wang Zhanhai emerged, and more than forty advanced producers gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Since the National Electric Power Conference in February of this year, the plant's leading cadres have more clearly recognized the importance of overhaul work. On the basis of last year's victory, the plant overhauled Boiler No. 3, which had not been repaired for eight years, in March of this year, and completed the major overhaul project of Boiler No. 2 and Steam Engine No. 2 in June. This was the first major overhaul since the plant was established. At the same time, the plant established a regular overhaul system for the future.

    The successful completion of the overhaul task is mainly due to the fact that the plant's trade union and administration signed a collective contract in March of this year, which made the workers have a clearer understanding of the production task, regarded the production plan as their own struggle goal, and made every effort to ensure the realization of the contract. Coordination between departments has also been achieved, and technical personnel, technicians, and ordinary workers have cooperated to overcome difficulties together.

    On the basis of regular overhauls, the plant has implemented a responsibility system for machine management, giving play to the workers' spirit of high care and meticulous management of the machines. As a result, all faults were eliminated in June and July, creating a new record since the plant was established. After the practical test of four overhauls, all the plant's employees personally experienced the creative ability of the working class and the power of collective organization, and recognized the errors of purely technical viewpoints and narrow conservative thinking.

　　天津第一发电厂的检修工作
    本报记者  剑清
    天津电业局第一发电厂的行政领导，树立了依靠工人阶级的思想，逐步克服了单纯的技术观点，使该厂生产效率不断提高。该厂经过去年八月到今年六月的四次大检修后，陈旧的机器已经充分发挥了应有的效能，发电能力已经显著提高，因而负荷量由二万二千千瓦增到二万七千千瓦，煤耗由○点八公斤，降到○·五三六七公斤（局定标准为每度○·五公斤），汽耗每度由五点一八公斤降到四点八八公斤以下。这样就降低了成本，保证了安全运转，充分供应了天津市的工业用电。
    该厂有职工一百九十七人，厂内全部是近代化的机械设备。发电设备能力，最高负荷是三万千瓦，是京、津、唐发电网中重要的组成部分。天津炼钢厂、中纺各厂、橡胶、造纸等厂全部由它供电，因而成为天津工业动力的心脏。
    在国民党反动统治时期，由于管理上的腐败无能，从来没有过定期的检修，致使机器时常发生故障。市民们把该发电厂叫做“黑暗公司”。解放初期，该厂有时还因发生故障而停电。为恢复设备效能，保证安全送电，去年七月该厂就提出实行定期检修的基本方法，但当时技术人员及部分职工都存有单纯技术观点，认为只有增加新的设备或减少出力才能做到。为战胜这种陈旧的错误观点，领导干部召开了各种会议进行动员、酝酿，指出检修的好处，及依靠工人群众的创造能力是能够克服困难的。在施工前一个月，行政领导作了周密的检修计划。这个计划包括劳动力的组织、材料和工具的准备、制定工作进度等；经过工厂管委会讨论以后，又拿到工会、党、团小组会上去讨论，根据工人的意见修改后执行。
    检修工作是从去年八月八日正式开始的，计划在二十天内完成二号锅炉及一号蒸气机的检修。在初期，单纯技术观点与各自为政的保守思想仍阻碍着工作的进行。这表现在一部分技术人员仍习惯于坐在办公室里作计划，不愿与实际操作的工人结合，轻视工人的力量，各部门之间仍调不动人，还得向外雇小工、加班。领导干部针对这种思想及时进行教育，指出必须依靠团结互助，树立整体观念，才能胜利完成检修任务。并团结了工人中的先进分子作骨干，发挥他们的劳动创造热情，带动一般职工前进，因而逐渐打消了这些阻碍。在工人们紧张的劳动下，仅十四天即全部完成检修任务。汽机股工人于兆章、韩家祥弟兄等的苦心研究，以代用品自制了十一个喷汽嘴，换在一号汽机上，使汽耗降低了百分之五。上海新通公司专制ＢＢＣ汽机的工程师，听到这个消息极为惊奇，曾特别到该厂参观。劳动模范贾茂生不避风雨埋头苦干，创造了十四天接杆制造一百二十根干汽管的新纪录。水泵修理组工友沈澜，在二十二小时内完成了敌伪时期需一星期才能完成的修锅工作，保证了安全送电。在检修一号锅炉时，工人们研究用风钢改成三个洗刀片，把四分厚的坚硬水锈给洗干净了。此外电机股、修理股、煤台亦创造了光辉的成绩。领导干部及时总结，公布成绩，表扬、奖励劳模，鼓励了工作情绪。
    去年十二月进行第二次检修，原计划在十四天内检修完二号锅炉。结果仅七天即完成了，较八月份提前一半时间。在两次检修中涌现了于兆章、王占海等五十二名劳动模范，并有四十多个生产先进者光荣地参加了中国共产党。自今年二月全国电业会议以后，该厂领导干部更明确认识了检修工作的重要性。在去年胜利的基础上，该厂今年三月检修了八年未曾修理过的三号锅炉，六月份完成了二号锅炉、二号汽机的巨大检修工程。这是该厂成立以来的第一次大检修。同时该厂建立了今后定期检修制度。
    检修任务的胜利完成，主要是由于今年三月该厂工会与行政订立了集体合同，使工人对生产任务有了更明确的认识，把生产计划当成自己的奋斗目标，以全力来保证合同的实现。各部门间也做到了互相配合、技术人员、技工与普通工人合作，共同克服了困难。
    在定期检修的基础上，该厂对机器管理已推行了负责制，发挥了工人对机器高度爱护和精心管理的精神，因之在六、七月份已全部消灭故障，创造了该厂建厂以来的新纪录。经过四次检修的实际考验，使全厂职工亲身体验到工人阶级的创造能力和集体组织的力量，认识了单纯的技术观点与狭隘的保守思想的错误。
