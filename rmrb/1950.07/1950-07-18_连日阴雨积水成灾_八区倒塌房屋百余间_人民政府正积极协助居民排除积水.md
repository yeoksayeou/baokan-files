　　Continuous Rain Causes Flooding
    Over a Hundred Houses Collapse in the Eighth District
    People's Government Actively Assists Residents in Draining Floodwater
    [Reported by this newspaper] The city of Beijing has experienced continuous rain in recent days, with even heavier rainfall yesterday (the 17th). Due to the long-term neglect of sewer repairs under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the complete absence of sewers in the residential areas of the working people, severe flooding has occurred in low-lying areas both inside and outside the city after this heavy rain, especially in the Eighth and Ninth Districts, which originally lacked sewer systems. In the Eighth District, over one hundred and twenty dilapidated houses have already collapsed. The Beijing Municipal People's Government attaches great importance to this situation and has already instructed the district offices concerned to take appropriate measures. The Eighth District is currently mobilizing and assisting residents whose houses have been flooded to temporarily relocate to other places. The Ninth District has opened the blocked sections of the unfinished Longxugou drainage project to quickly drain the accumulated water. The Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau has also dispatched more than forty workers to the Eighth District overnight to assist residents in their drainage efforts.

　　连日阴雨积水成灾
    八区倒塌房屋百余间
    人民政府正积极协助居民排除积水
    【本报讯】京市连日阴雨，昨（十七）日雨势更大。由于国民党反动统治下，长年未修整下水道工程，而且劳动人民居住地区根本没有下水道，以致在此大雨之后，城内外低地区，特别是八九两区原来没有下水道地区，积水情况非常严重。第八区且已有一百二十余间年久失修的房屋倒塌。京市人民政府对此十分重视，顷已通知各该区区公所采取适当措施。八区现正动员与协助房屋被淹的居民暂时迁移他处；九区已将未完工之龙须沟排水工程的堵口挖开，以便将积水迅速排出。市卫生工程局并连夜派四十多名工人到八区协助居民进行排水工作。
