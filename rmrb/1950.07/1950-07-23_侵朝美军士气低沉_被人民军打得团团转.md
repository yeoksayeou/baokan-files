　　Invading American Army's Morale is Low
    Being Beaten Around by the People's Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch] The American army, retreating step by step under the heavy blows of the Korean People's Army, has very low morale. United Press reporter Ralph Teats, after narrating in his dispatch that "this is a cold, undignified, and always losing war," wrote: "The morale of the American army in Korea is low; from the rear bases in Japan to the forward outposts, we can see heavy expressions everywhere. ...The hallmark of American soldiers—joking and swearing—has been lost. The word "front" is misleading when used to describe the Korean battlefield. It changes every minute.” Teats also said: "The American army often engages in short, fierce battles with the enemy and then retreats. No one can guarantee where the front line is at any time of the 24 hours of the day. But there is no doubt that the front line has been constantly retreating to the south in the past. No one denies that the American army has been beaten around by the communists, which has had a demoralizing effect."

　　侵朝美军士气低沉
    被人民军打得团团转
    【新华社二十二日讯】在朝鲜人民军沉重打击之下节节溃退的美军，士气十分低沉。合众社记者罗夫·蒂特少斯在他的通讯中叙述了“这是一个冷酷的、不体面的、总是吃败仗的战争”之后写道：“美军在朝鲜的士气是低沉的；从日本的后方基地直到前进据点，我们到处都能看到沉重的表情。……美国士兵所特有的标记——开玩笑与说下流话——已被丢掉了。“前线”这个字眼对朝鲜战场来说，是容易使人迷惑的。它每分钟都在变化。”蒂特少斯又说：“美军常与敌人作短时间的激战后随即败退下来。没有人在一天二十四小时中的任何时期内都能担保说战线在那里。但没有疑问的是：战线在过去不断地往南退却。谁也不否认美军被共产党打得团团转，产生了涣散士气的影响。”
