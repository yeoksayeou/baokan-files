　　The So-Called "Schuman Plan"
　　On May 9th of this year, French Foreign Minister Schuman issued a statement suggesting to capitalist countries that France and West Germany should jointly manage coal and steel resources, advocating that "all French and German coal and steel production should be placed under a high joint management authority," and that "this joint management authority should be included in an organization that welcomes the participation of all other European countries." This means that the coal and steel industries of France and West Germany, as well as all Western European countries, should be merged into a large international trust controlled by American monopoly capital. After holding a full day of meetings with Acheson on May 8th and "reaching an agreement," Schuman issued this statement selling out national interests the very next day, openly paving the way for his American masters to manipulate the Western European economy.
　　According to Schuman's plan, this high joint management authority is part of the Atlantic alliance war machine controlled by U.S. imperialism. It is one of the steps the United States is taking towards a war of aggression. Under this plan, the ultimate goal of the United States is to try to drag West Germany into the Atlantic aggressive bloc and further tighten its military, political and economic control over Western Europe, in order to facilitate its launching of a war of aggression.
　　Under the instigation of the United States, negotiations on the so-called "Schuman Plan" began in Paris on June 2nd. Representatives from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and the West German puppet government participated. The U.S. government had many doubts about the "Schuman Plan" and was unwilling to completely hand over the coal and steel industries to the United States. Therefore, the British government refused to participate and only sent liaison officers to maintain contact with the French government in order to know the progress of the negotiations. The negotiations were interrupted after five days. This was obviously due to disagreements and contradictions between the countries participating in the negotiations, as well as between the United States and Britain.
　　After the "Schuman Plan" was published, it was first met with strong opposition from the French people. The French Communist Party Political Bureau issued a statement on June 16th, denouncing the Schuman Plan as a treasonous plan, and pointed out that this plan would make France subordinate to Bonn Germany, and Bonn Germany is a vassal of the United States. The miners' congress of the Nord and Pas-de-Calais regions of France, which closed on June 18th, unanimously resolved to oppose the Schuman Plan.
　　German Communist Party Chairman Lehmann denounced Schuman's proposal as an "alliance of death merchants."
　　The wave of opposition from the people of Western European countries is rising.

　　所谓“舒曼计划”
    本年五月九日，法国外长舒曼发表了一项声明，向资本主义各国建议法国与西德联营煤钢资源，主张“全部法德煤钢的生产，均应置于一高级共管机关之下”，而且“这一共管机关应包括于一欢迎其他一切欧洲国家参加的组织之内”。这就是说，要把法国与西德以及全部西欧国家的煤炭与钢铁工业均合并在一个美国独占资本控制下的大国际托辣斯里。舒曼于五月八日与艾奇逊整日会议“获致协议”后，就在第二天提出这一项出卖民族利益的声明，明目张胆地给他的美国主子开辟操纵西欧经济的道路。
    按照舒曼的计划，这一高级共管机关是美帝国主义操纵下的大西洋联盟战争机器组成的一部分。是美国走向侵略战争的步骤之一。在这个计划下，美国的最终目的，是企图把西德拉入大西洋侵略集团，并进一步抓紧西欧的军事政治经济的控制权，以便利于它发动侵略战争。
    在美国策动下，六月二日在巴黎开始了所谓“舒曼计划”的谈判。参加的有法、意、荷、比、卢五国及西德傀儡政府代表。美国政府对“舒曼计划”是有许多疑虑的，它不愿完全将煤钢工业交给美国。因之，英国政府拒绝参加，只派联络员与法政府保持接触以便知道谈判进程。谈判经过五天便告中断。这显然是由于参加谈判各国之间以及美英之间存着意见分歧与矛盾的缘故。
    “舒曼计划”发表后，首先遭到法国人民的强烈反对。法共政治局于六月十六日发表声明，斥舒曼计划为卖国计划，并指出：这个计划将使法国从属于波恩德国，而波恩德国则是美国的附庸。六月十八日闭幕的法国诺尔省和加莱海峡省的矿工代表大会一致决议反对舒曼计划。
    西德共产党主席雷曼则斥舒曼建议为“死亡贩卖商的联盟”。
    西欧各国人民的反对声浪正日益高涨中。
