　　Nanchang - Glorious Revolutionary City
　　Dai Bang
　　Nanchang is the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a glorious revolutionary city.
　　At dawn on August 1, 1927, an armed force of more than 30,000 people led by the Chinese Communist Party, under the command of Generals Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, He Long, Ye Ting, Yun Daiying, Liu Bocheng, Nie Rongzhen, and Chen Yi, launched an armed uprising in Nanchang. After three hours of fierce fighting, they annihilated the headquarters of the Third Army of Zhu Peide's Nationalist army and planted the revolutionary red flag on the city walls. In addition to Communists, Guo Moruo, Tan Pingshan, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin, and others also participated in the armed uprising. The Nanchang Uprising marked the beginning of the Chinese people's use of organized revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces, and the completely new army of the Chinese people under the independent leadership of the Chinese Communist Party was born from this. Although the armed uprising forces were forced to withdraw from Nanchang City five days after the uprising, these five days laid the foundation for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution today.
　　On May 22, 1949, Nanchang was liberated again. The Kuomintang's reactionary rule of more than 20 years was completely overthrown, and the people of Nanchang breathed freely again, and will forever breathe the air of freedom and democracy. "August 1st," this glorious phrase, is written in every place of historical significance. The stadium where the armed uprising forces fought against the Kuomintang reactionary army at that time has now been renamed August 1st Park. The Ganjiang Bridge, spanning 1,000 meters across the Ganjiang River, has now been renamed August 1st Bridge. People also use "August 1st" as the name of factories, libraries, locomotives, and so on.
　　The words "August 1st" are deeply engraved in everyone's heart. After the liberation of Nanchang, all visitors who came here to visit lost interest in the city's scenic spots and historical sites such as Baihua Islet and the Pavilion of Prince Teng. What they eagerly hoped to admire were: the former residence of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the uprising headquarters of Generals He Long and Ye Ting, as well as the ancient temple in the north of the city and other revolutionary memorial sites where secret military meetings were held before the uprising.
　　When the People's Liberation Army marched towards Guangdong, Hunan, and the Southwest, the people of the city, under the slogan "Everything for the Victory of the Front," received hundreds of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers passing through Nanchang with unparalleled enthusiasm. Workers and farmers, despite the serious difficulties of severe floods and summer famine, cooperated with the engineering corps to repair more than 500 bridges of all sizes on the highways. The farmers enthusiastically contributed grain, and the women made shoes and sewed clothes, providing tea and cooking along the way to support the People's Liberation Army in its courageous advance. They treated their own army with the same enthusiasm as they would their own relatives.
　　The people of Nanchang have used traditional revolutionary enthusiasm to restore the wounds left by the war. Citizens enthusiastically purchased nearly 800,000 shares of Victory Inflation-Adjusted Public Bonds, exceeding the original allocation by 15 percent in a short period. In 55 days, the citizens built more than 13,000 meters of the Ganjiang Fu Dayou Embankment, ensuring the safety of traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and saving nearly 60,000 mu of farmland in the suburbs from flooding.
　　In the revolutionary struggle, the people of Nanchang have experienced the arduous road from failure to victory. The people cherish the fruits of victory obtained from the arduous struggle. More than 90 percent of them have signed their names on the Peace Declaration, fully expressing the Nanchang people's desire and determination to defend peace.
　　Nanchang, this historical city, will forever emit revolutionary glory.

　　南昌—光辉的革命城
    戴邦
    南昌是中国人民解放军的诞生地，光辉的革命城。
    一九二七年八月一日的黎明时分，中国共产党所领导的一支三万余人的武装部队，在朱德、周恩来、贺龙、叶挺、恽代英、刘伯承、聂荣臻、陈毅等将军率领下在南昌举行了武装起义，经过三小时的激战，歼灭了国民党军朱培德部的第三军军部，把革命红旗插在城头上。参加这次武装起义的，除共产党人外，郭沫若、谭平山、章伯钧、彭泽民等人也参加了。南昌起义标志着中国人民以有组织的革命武装反对反革命的武装的开始，在中国共产党独立领导下的中国人民完全崭新的军队从此诞生。武装起义的部队虽然在举行起义的五天以后就被迫退出了南昌城，但这五天却奠定了今天中国人民革命胜利的基础。
    一九四九年五月二十二日，南昌再度解放了。国民党二十多年来的反动统治被彻底推翻，南昌人民重又呼吸着而且是永远呼吸着自由民主的空气。“八一”，这光荣的字样，被写在每一个有历史意义的地方。曾为当时武装起义部队与国民党反动军队作战过的体育场现已改称为八一公园。横跨赣江长达一千公尺的赣江大桥，现在被改名为八一桥。人们还用“八一”来作为工厂、图书馆、机车等等的命名。
    “八一”这两个字，深深地刻在每个人的心里。在南昌解放后，所有来到这里访问的游人，对市内名胜古迹如百花洲、滕王阁这些地方已经失去了兴趣，他们迫切希望瞻仰的是：朱总司令当年的住处，贺龙、叶挺将军的起义指挥部，以及曾在起义前开过秘密军事会议的城北大古庙和其他革命纪念地。
    当人民解放军向广东、湖南及西南进军时，全市人民在“一切为了前线胜利”的口号下，用无比的热情接待从南昌经过的成十万的人民解放军。工人、农民在严重的水灾和夏荒的困难下，配合工兵修好了五百多座公路上的大小桥梁，农民们踊跃拿出粮食，妇女们做鞋、缝衣，在沿途烧茶、做饭以支援解放大军奋勇前进。他们以对待自己亲人一般的热情来招待自己的军队。
    南昌人民已经以传统的革命热情，来恢复战争所遗留下来的创伤。市民们踊跃购买胜利折实公债近八十万分，在短期内超额完成了原分配额的百分之十五。在五十五天中，市民们修筑了一万三千多公尺长的赣江富大有圩堤，保证了浙赣线交通的安全，并使近郊近六万亩农田免遭水患。
    南昌人民在革命斗争中，经历了从失败走向胜利的艰苦道路。人民珍惜从艰苦斗争中得来的胜利果实。他们已经有百分之九十以上在和平宣言上签了自己的名字，充分表示了南昌人民保卫和平的愿望和决心。
    南昌，这座历史名城将永远发射着革命的光辉。
