Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th: People from all walks of life in Shanghai and Nanjing warmly support the Land Reform Law. Many organizations and schools have begun discussing and studying the Land Reform Law.

　　Shanghai Wenhui Daily, in its editorial entitled "Supporting Land Reform," said: We must basically complete this great work in the next three to five years in order to open up the road to national industrialization. Ta Kung Pao's editorial said: Land reform is a major revolution, but it is essentially a capitalist revolution. The broad masses of peasants certainly support land reform, and the national bourgeoisie should also support it. The Shanghai branch of the China Democratic League called on intellectuals to take on the task of publicizing the Land Reform Law; and called on the industrial and commercial sectors to stand firm, eliminate ideological obstacles, and encourage each other to pass the hurdle of land reform. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Shanghai branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Shanghai Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party all unanimously stated: The Land Reform Law is in line with the interests of the New Democratic Revolution and in line with the interests of all the people; and called on all revolutionary people to fight in an organized manner within the anti-feudal united front to complete this historical task. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce also published written opinions on behalf of the entire Shanghai industrial and commercial sector in newspapers, expressing support for the Land Reform Law.

　　Workers, students, and peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai have all begun discussions or study of the Land Reform Law. Unemployed workers are particularly pleased with the point that they can be allocated land when they return to their hometowns. The Shanghai Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League called on all members and youths in the city to step up their study and welcome the land reform movement in the new areas this winter. The student union and Youth League branch of the New China College of Law and Commerce are organizing students to study the Land Reform Law during the summer vacation. Rural cadres in the Jiangwan District in the suburbs of the city have organized newspaper reading groups to study the Land Reform Law. The Municipal Farmers' Association believes that although the Land Reform Law does not apply to the suburbs of large cities, they will conduct propaganda among the peasants in the suburbs, and actively consolidate and expand the farmers' association organizations to prepare for land reform in the suburbs.

　　Nanjing Circles Hold Discussions One After Another

　　Nanjing: After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, various agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life held discussions one after another. Workers at the clothing factory stated at the symposium that they would support the peasants and join hands with the peasants to work together for the industrialization of New China. Farmers in the suburbs of the city were even more pleased to hear the news of the promulgation of the Land Reform Law. They borrowed newspapers from the township government to inquire about the truth. Farmers Hu Jinde and Xiong Licheng of Taiping Village immediately wrote a letter thanking Chairman Mao after hearing about the Land Reform Law. Most of the students have begun to study the Land Reform Law. Many students whose families are landlords have expressed that they will abandon the interests of their class to serve the people. Cheng Shuangren, a student from the Municipal No. 2 Middle School, said that he would persuade his family to hand over the land to the peasants for distribution. Chen Suiheng, the director of Youheng Flour Mill, Qian Zhonghan, a professor at Nanjing University, and other people from the industrial and commercial and education circles all believed that the Land Reform Law was carefully considered. Shao Hengqiu, a member of the Nanjing branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Nanjing branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party all issued written opinions, supporting this important document that opened up the road to the industrialization of New China.
