　　The Conservation Movement at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
　　Jiang Hongbin
　　During the Red May production competition, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory increased production, improved the serious waste in production, and timely corrected the phenomenon of increased defective products.

　　Serious Waste Phenomenon
　　The serious waste facts of the factory in the past were: 1. Waste of raw materials. For example, waterwheel screws were several points longer than the blueprint; coal and coke were taken without calculation, exceeding the required amount; parts were thrown all over the ground; more seriously, workers only cared about producing more and faster, so they picked the newest and best materials at hand, regardless of cost. 2. Waste of electricity. Lights were not turned off during breaks, running empty machines, and individual employees used electric stoves, etc. 3. Waste of man-hours. Because the material requisition system was not sound, materials were requisitioned as needed, and a large group of people often waited in front of the warehouse; labor allocation was also not good enough, and there was a phenomenon of waiting for materials to stop work. 4. Finished products scrapped. Due to insufficient work planning and an unsound inspection system, a large number of threshing machine tooth wheels, chaff cutter belt pulleys, and corn sheller iron covers produced in January and February had to be returned to the furnace or modified. In addition, the protection of machines was also very inadequate. Sometimes the car was driven for too long and the electric roller got hot, and sometimes it was too economical to add lubricating oil, which seriously damaged the machine.

　　Launch a Mass Conservation Movement
　　In early May, the factory's management committee decided at a meeting to launch a mass conservation movement as the central content of the Red May production competition. At the meeting, the administrative负责人 first reviewed the past insufficient understanding of the importance of anti-waste, and the members also made self-criticism. For example, worker committee member Wang Wentao said: "When I was cutting materials, I threw some usable long material heads into the scrap iron pile because I was too lazy. Sometimes I walked away without stopping the machine, wasting electricity." Many specific waste facts educated everyone, which was a powerful ideological mobilization. The meeting also studied the specific steps of the conservation movement. A mass meeting was held on the same day. Each department, office, field, and production group enthusiastically launched discussions and checked the past waste phenomena. Administrative and trade union cadres, as well as party and league members, went deep into the masses and used various methods such as mimeographed tabloids, big-character posters, broadcasting, and slogans to set off the largest mass conservation wave since the establishment of the factory. The lathe workshop, fitter workshop, and tool room all formulated conservation pacts. The fitter workshop proposed: cherish tools, use fewer new files, and use fixed quotas of machine oil, cotton yarn, and sandpaper, etc. The lathe workshop proposed: resolutely protect machines, conduct regular inspections, and ensure safe operation. The milling and planing group guaranteed: do not run empty cars, and add oil to the machine appropriately. The tool room formulated a method of "exchanging old tools for new ones," and stipulated that all lathe tools and drill bits should be ground to standard angles by tool room technicians, so that the lathe workers do not have to sharpen their own knives to save time.

　　In the past, the factory's material requisition procedures were very unscientific. Sometimes technicians had to go to the warehouse to search for them in person, sometimes they waited for a long time without receiving them, and sometimes they did not write a ticket when they received the materials, or they could not receive the materials even if they wrote a ticket; it was extremely chaotic and it was impossible to accurately calculate costs. This time, after mass discussion, a relatively complete material requisition system was formulated: each unit first reports the required materials to the warehouse, the warehouse prepares the materials two days in advance, and the apprentices take them out before work. No materials are issued without procedures, and unused materials must be returned, and waste products must be handed over to the waste product warehouse. In this way, everything is in order, everyone feels convenient, and waste can be checked and costs can be calculated at any time.

　　After the conservation movement was launched, all employees enthusiastically joined the wave. In mid-May, the forging workshop renovated and reused waste practice bars, saving 5,000 catties of millet. Forger Mi Derui picked up waste materials and made more than 1,000 sets of screws. The fitter screw group saved 17 sets of die cores in their work, totaling 1,020 catties of millet. The lathe workshop selected conservation affairs officers and security affairs officers for each group; the use of machine oil and cotton yarn was implemented with a quota ticket system. In one month, a total of 75 catties of machine oil and 30 catties of cotton yarn were saved. The machine did not have any accidents. The small furnace in the foundry workshop used to refine 4.5 catties of pig iron per catty of coke. During the conservation movement, it was increased to 1:7, saving 12 tons of coke per month. The electricity saving is also very significant. In terms of lighting alone, the daily electricity consumption was more than 100 degrees in early May, but after implementing strict conservation, it dropped to 55 degrees per day.

　　During the movement, members of the management committee went deep into the workshops for inspection. A certain member personally took the lead and mobilized everyone to pick up more than one ton of scrap iron in three hours. Guan Wei Chen Bochuan picked up screws and other things on the way to and from work every day and put them in the waste material box. The practical actions of leading cadres further stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for conservation. For example, the workers in the rail steel department picked up more than 1,000 catties of scrap iron during the spare time of burning iron.

　　Establish Various Systems
　　In addition to the conservation covenants formulated by each workshop during the movement, a clear material collection system, tool management and compensation system were also established, and daily standard quotas for consumables were also formulated. This makes it necessary for each workshop to make careful calculations when formulating production plans to meet the spirit of conservation. The establishment of waste product boxes and waste product warehouses plays a good role in collecting lost materials.

　　In the discussion of the production competition reward system, the trade union especially emphasized the conservation reward method, but those who waste or exceed the scrap rate should have their production bonuses deducted, and those with serious circumstances should be criticized or punished. Foundry apprentice Li Zengkun suggested concentrating on baking cores, which could save 60 catties of coke and 1,200 catties of firewood per month. Technician Wang Fushou proposed using sunlight to bake small cast core, which could save 4,000 catties of coke and 800 catties of firewood per month. The management committee is discussing giving appropriate rewards to all those who put forward reasonable suggestions and implement them effectively.

　　Reduce the Defect Rate
　　In the midst of the vigorous conservation movement, in late May it was suddenly discovered that the scrap rate of gray iron castings in the foundry workshop had increased rapidly, reaching 12%. After the factory director went deep into the scene to understand the situation, he immediately summoned the engineers and field supervisors to study ways to overcome the problem, arranged for in-depth inspection work, and stipulated that the scrap rate should not exceed 8%. Through the efforts of the employees, it dropped to 5% on the third day. Since then, the average has not exceeded 6%. This is a direct result of the employees' clear understanding of the serious harm of waste to production.

　　The 50-day conservation movement has effectively improved the long-standing serious waste phenomenon in the factory, consolidated the results of the production competition, and laid the foundation for the production competition movement of "improving product quality and reducing production costs" in July.

　　华北农业机械总厂的节约运动
    蒋弘彬
    华北农业机械总厂在红五月生产竞赛中产量提高，改进了生产中的严重浪费情形，并及时纠正了废品增多的现象。
    严重的浪费现象
    该厂过去严重的浪费事实是：一、原材料的浪费。如水车螺丝比图长好几分；领煤领焦不计算，超过了需用量；零件满地扔；更严重的是工人只顾多生产，做得快，便捡手边最新、最好的料用；不顾成本。二、电力的浪费。休息时不关灯，打空车，个别职员使用电炉等。三、工时的浪费。因为领料制度不健全，随用随领，仓库门前常等着一大堆人；劳力配备也不够好，有停工待料现象。四、成品作废。由于工作计划性不够，检验制度不健全，一、二月份生产的大批打谷机牙轮、铡草机皮带轮、玉米脱粒机铁盖等，须回炉或改制。此外，对机器保护也很不周到，有时开车过久，电滚子发热，有时过分节约，舍不得加滑润油，严重地损蚀机器。
    开展群众性的节约运动
    五月上旬，该厂管委会开会时，决定开展一个群众性的节约运动，做为红五月生产竞赛的中心内容。会中，行政负责人首先检讨了过去对反浪费的重要性认识不足，各委员也都做了自我检讨。如工人委员王文涛说：“我在下料时因为嫌麻烦，把一些能用的长料头就扔在废铁堆里了。有时人走开了不停机器，浪费了电力。”很多具体的浪费事实教育了大家，这是一次有力的思想动员。会上并研究了节约运动的具体步骤。当天召开了群众大会。各科、室、场、生产小组热烈展开讨论，并检查了过去的浪费现象。行政和工会干部，及党、团员分别深入群众，利用油印小报、大字报、广播、标语等各种方式，掀起了建厂以来最大规模的群众性的节约浪潮。车工场、钳工场、工具室都订出了节约公约。钳工场提出：爱护工具，少用新锉刀，定额使用机油、棉丝、砂布等。车工场提出：坚决保护机器，定期检验，保证安全运转。铣刨小组保证：不开空车，适当地给机器加油。工具室订出了工具“交旧领新”的办法，并规定，所有的车刀钻头，均由工具室技工磨出标准角度，车工不必自己磨刀，以节省时间。
    该厂过去领料手续很不科学，有时技工得亲自去仓库翻找，有时等好久领不到，有时领了料没写票，或写了票领不到料；混乱异常，根本无法精确计算成本。这次经群众讨论，订出了比较完善的领料制度：各单位先将需用材料报给仓库，仓库头两天将料备齐，由学徒于工作之前领出，没有手续不发，用不完的须退回，废品交废品库。这样一来，秩序井然，大家都感到方便，同时可以随时检查浪费及计算成本。
    节约运动开展后，全体职工均热烈投入这一浪潮。五月中锻工场将废练条翻新使用，节省了小米五千斤。锻工米德瑞捡废料打了一千多付螺丝。钳工螺丝组，工作中节省十七付板牙心，合小米一千零二十斤。车工场各小组选出了节约干事和保安干事；使用机油、棉丝实行了定量领用票制度。一个月来共节约机油七十五斤，棉丝三十斤。机器也未出事故。铸工场的小型熔炉，过去一斤焦炭能炼生铁四点五斤，节约运动中，提高至一比七，每月可节约焦炭十二吨。电力的节约也很显著。仅就照明一项，五月上旬每日用电一百度以上，厉行节约后，降至每日用电五十五度。
    在运动中，管委会各委员深入车间进行检查。某委员亲自带头，动员大家在三个钟头内捡废铁一吨多。管委陈伯川每天上下班路过场院，捡到螺丝钉等就放到废料箱中。领导干部的实际行动，更激发了大家的节约热忱，如轨钢部工友，利用烧铁的空余时间即捡了废铁一千多斤。
    建立各种制度
    运动中除各车间订有节约公约外，又建立了明确的材料领取制度，工具保管和赔偿制度，消耗品也订出了每日标准定量。这样使得各车间在订定生产计划时，必须精打细算，符合节约精神。废品箱与废品仓库的建立，对收集散失材料，起着良好作用。
    工会在讨论生产竞赛奖励制度中，特别强调节约奖励办法，但对浪费或超过废品率者，认为应从其生产奖金中扣除，情况严重者并应给予批评或处分。铸工学徒李曾琨建议集中烤芯子，每月可节省焦炭六十斤、木柴一千二百斤。技工王福寿提议利用日光烤小铸件芯子，每月可省焦炭四千斤、木柴八百斤。对所有提出合理建议并实施有效者，管委会正讨论给予适当奖励。
    降低废品率
    节约运动蓬勃开展中，五月下旬突然发现铸工场灰口铁铸件的废品率，迅速增加，高达百分之十二。厂长深入现场了解后，立即召集了工程师和场主管研究克服办法，布置深入检查工作，规定废品率不得超过百分之八。经职工的努力，第三天就降到百分之五。以后平均也没有超过百分之六。这是职工明确了浪费对生产重大危害后的直接结果。
    五十多天的节约运动，有效地改进了该厂由来以久的严重浪费现象，巩固了生产竞赛的成果，给七月份开展“提高产品质量、减低生产成本”的生产竞赛运动奠定了基础。
