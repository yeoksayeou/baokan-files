　　Head of the Ministry of Culture Issues Statement
    Concerning the announcement of the five provisional measures regarding film industry to develop domestic films, resist poisonous American films; to implement patriotism and a policy of public-private partnership in film industry.
    [Our Newspaper] Regarding the basic spirit of the five provisional measures concerning the film industry issued by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture and the issues that should be paid attention to in their implementation, this reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture, who made the following statement:
    Today, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture issued five provisional measures: "Issuance of Performance Licenses for New Films," "Export of Domestic Films," "Import of Foreign Films," "Screening of Old Films," and "Film Industry Registration." The formulation of these measures is to develop domestic films, resist poisonous American films, and protect and support private film companies to appropriately cooperate with state-owned film enterprises, in order to implement the spirit of patriotism and a policy of public-private partnership in the film industry.
    In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's traitorous policy of relying on American imperialism, a large number of American films (the vast majority of which were poisonous) were imported without restriction, filling the Chinese film market and making it impossible for the country's film production industry to develop. Furthermore, under the Kuomintang's reactionary cultural policy, any film with progressive tendencies was destroyed and suppressed; while films filled with feudal, comprador consciousness and supernatural, obscene, and depraved toxins were encouraged and condoned. The above-mentioned American and old domestic films are still being screened in various places. In response to this situation, after the establishment of the Central Ministry of Culture, it followed the Common Program's policy on culture and education and vigorously developed a new people's film industry. In addition to actively developing state-owned films, it supported and guided private film companies, encouraging them to produce progressive films, in order to jointly resist and replace poisonous American and old domestic films, and strive for the complete dominance of progressive films in the film market.
    The main domestic private film studios are Kunlun, Wenhua, Datong, and Guotai. Since liberation, private companies have produced thirteen films (excluding Hong Kong). Generally, the tendencies are progressive, such as "This Life of Mine" and "Crows and Sparrows." However, the private film industry itself has a weak foundation, and difficulties have arisen in terms of funds, scripts, and other aspects. In the past six months or so, the People's Government has provided a total of approximately 4.8 billion in assistance to support and guide private film companies, including distribution, export and other loans, to help them overcome the difficulties before and after the Spring Festival and carry out reproduction. The problems that the private film industry is most concerned about, such as film review standards, film import and export, and foreign exchange income, will be resolved due to the issuance of the above five measures.
    The "Issuance of Performance Licenses for New Films" stipulates that private film companies that have been registered and approved can obtain performance licenses for their productions without review; it also stipulates that local agencies at all levels shall not arbitrarily prohibit screenings without the permission of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture. For foreign imported films, the "Import of Foreign Films" measure stipulates a certain review system, namely: "If the content of imported films is against world peace, against people's democracy, violates Chinese national interests, or promotes obscene, pornographic superstition, terror, etc., and is sufficient to hinder the order of the new society, it shall be censored or rejected depending on the severity of the circumstances." In the past, the review of old domestic films was decentralized and conducted by various regions, without unified review standards and methods. Now, the "Screening of Old Films" measure stipulates a more unified and appropriate review method than in the past, which is also beneficial to the private film industry. Regarding the import and export of private films and foreign exchange income, the "Export of Domestic Films" measure stipulates that film companies that have been registered and approved may apply to export new and old domestic films. For good films, they may also apply for tax reductions or exemptions, or request the National Bank to provide acceptance or export loans. If the film exporter is a film production company that is continuing production, it may apply for foreign exchange to order supplementary equipment from abroad due to production needs. The "Import of Foreign Films" measure stipulates that Chinese films produced by foreign and Hong Kong private film companies may be purchased for their domestic distribution rights by the state-owned film management company with foreign exchange. These two measures enable the private film industry to expand its domestic and foreign markets, and to apply for a portion of foreign exchange according to actual needs, in order to carry out reproduction and solve the problem of equipment supplementation. The formulation of the above five measures will undoubtedly promote the smoother development of the new people's film industry.

　　文化部负责人发表谈话
    有关电影事业五项暂行办法的公布，是为了发展国产电影，抵制有毒素的美国影片；贯彻电影事业上的爱国主义精神与公私兼顾的政策。
    【本报讯】记者就中央人民政府文化部所发布的有关电影事业的五项暂行办法的基本精神和执行中应注意的问题，访问了中央人民政府文化部负责人，承发表谈话如下：
    中央人民政府文化部本日发布《电影新片领发上演执照》、《国产影片输出》、《国外影片输入》、《电影旧片清理》、《影业登记》等五项暂行办法。这些办法的制定，是为了发展国产电影，抵制有毒素的美国片，保护与扶助私营电影业使之与国营电影事业适当地配合，以贯彻电影事业上的爱国主义精神与公私兼顾的政策。
    中国电影事业，过去由于国民党反动政府投靠美帝国主义的卖国政策，致使大量的美国片（其中绝大部分为有毒素的影片）无限制地进口，充斥了中国电影市场，使本国的电影制作业无法发展。而国内电影制作，又在国民党的反动文化政策之下，凡带有进步倾向的电影，均受到摧残、压迫；而充满封建买办意识与神怪淫靡毒素的电影，则受到鼓励与纵容。上述美国片及国产旧片尚在各地演映。针对此种情况，中央文化部成立后，即遵照共同纲领文教政策，大力发展新的人民电影事业。除积极发展国营电影外，并扶助与指导私营电影业，鼓励其摄制进步电影，以期共同抵制与代替有毒素的美国片与国产旧片，争取进步电影在电影市场上的完全优势。
    国内私营电影制片厂，主要有昆仑、文华、大同、国泰四家。解放后，私营出品有十三部（香港除外），倾向一般都是进步的，如《我这一辈子》、《乌鸦与麻雀》等。但私营电影业本身基础薄弱，在资金、剧本等各方面均曾发生困难。半年多来，在扶助与指导私营电影业上，人民政府曾给与发行、出口及其他贷款共约四十八亿，帮助其度过春节前后的难关与进行再生产。关于私营电影业所最关心的影片审查标准、影片出入口与外汇收入等问题，将因上述五个办法的发布，而得到解决。
    在《电影新片领发上演执照》的办法中规定：凡经登记核准之私营制片业，其出品不经审查即可领发上演执照；并规定各级地方机关未经中央人民政府文化部许可，不得擅自禁映。对于国外输入影片，则在《国外影片输入》办法中规定了一定的审查制度，即：“凡入口影片，其内容如有反世界和平、反人民民主，违反中国民族利益，或宣传淫猥色情迷信恐怖等，足以妨碍新社会之秩序者，视其情节轻重，应加以删剪或不予通过”。对于国产旧片，过去是由各地分散审查，无统一的审查标准和办法。现在在《电影旧片清理》办法中，已规定了比过去要统一与更妥善的审查办法，这也是有利于私营电影业的。关于私营影片出入口与外汇收入等问题，在《国产影片输出》办法中规定：凡经登记核准之电影业，可以申请输出新、旧国产影片，好的影片并可代为申请减税或免税，或代商请国家银行予以押汇或出口贷款。如影片输出者系正在继续生产之电影制片业，因生产需要向国外订购补充器材时，可呈准外汇。而在《国外影片输入》办法中则规定：国外及香港的私营制片业摄制之中国影片，可由国营影片经理公司以外汇购买其国内发行版权。这两个办法，使私营电影业能扩大其国内外市场，并能根据实际需要，呈准一部分外汇，以便其进行再生产及解决器材补充的问题。上述五个办法的制定，无疑将推进新的人民电影事业更顺利的发展。
