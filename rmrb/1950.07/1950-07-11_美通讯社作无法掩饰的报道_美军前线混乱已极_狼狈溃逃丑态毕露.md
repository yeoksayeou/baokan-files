Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Even the American news agencies could not hide the shameful rout of the American ground forces under the heavy blows of the Korean People's Army. A United Press dispatch from the Korean front on the 8th reported on the chaotic situation when the U.S. military withdrew from Cheonan, an important railway city south of Pyeongtaek, stating: "The Battle of Cheonan began on the 7th. The U.S. military had already retreated to the south of Cheonan, after which reconnaissance teams reported that North Korean troops were still ten miles north of Cheonan, and the U.S. artillery returned to the north of Cheonan. Unexpectedly, North Korean troops suddenly appeared in the mountains east of Cheonan. The U.S. military was ordered to retreat immediately. The artillery did not fire a single shot. Jeeps carrying officers and soldiers sped away. At this time, the U.S. military had only one wish: to be as far away from the North Korean army as possible. The U.S. military frontline was in extreme chaos. For example, one officer had just ordered the soldiers to get out of the jeeps to establish a defense line, while another officer ordered the soldiers to load up and retreat. Important bridges were originally thought to have been destroyed, but turned out to be safe and sound."

Associated Press, Tokyo, July 7th, quoted a report from its correspondent in Korea, Han Doman, saying: "The following fact can no longer be concealed this morning: the U.S. troops stationed in Korea have been severely beaten by the well-equipped, numerous, and proactive North Korean communist troops." The reporter also ridiculed the self-contradictory communiqués issued by the U.S. officials, saying that while admitting that the U.S. military had withdrawn ten miles, it also said that this was "only a tactical retreat" and a "change of defense line." Han Doman said: "The news from the front is different. American soldiers took off their shoes to escape the pursuing North Korean troops faster. The U.S. military fled so fast that they did not have time to take the wounded with them. A small number of American soldiers, in order to save their lives, joined a long line of Korean soldiers and refugees running for thirty-five miles." Han Doman said: "But the latest news received in Tokyo still says that the morale of the U.S. military is 'extremely high,' which is obliterating the facts."

The Kuomintang Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th, also admitted: "North Korean armored forces, which cut off the U.S. military's retreat in the Pyeongtaek-Osan area, directly attacked a railway point twenty miles away from the panic-stricken South Korean provisional capital (Daejeon) with infantry support." The dispatch stated: "American wounded soldiers were not evacuated in time, and the Rhee government's army (referring to the Rhee Syngman troops) collapsed in confusion." It also said: "When the U.S. military retreated, they made a forced march on roads where the mud was ankle-deep, appearing exhausted and depressed." (Attached picture)

### 美通讯社作无法掩饰的报道  美军前线混乱已极  狼狈溃逃丑态毕露

　　美通讯社作无法掩饰的报道
    美军前线混乱已极  狼狈溃逃丑态毕露
    【新华社九日讯】甚至连美国通讯社亦不能掩饰美国地面部队在朝鲜人民军痛击下溃逃的丑态。合众社朝鲜前线八日电报道美军退出平泽以南的重要铁路城市天安时的狼狈状况称：“天安战役系于七日开始，美军本已撤退至天安以南，其后，侦察队报告北朝鲜军队尚在天安以北十英里处，美步炮兵遂又开至天安以北。不料北朝鲜军队突在天安以东的山地中出现。美军当奉令立即撤退。炮队未开一炮。吉普车载着官兵飞奔。此时，美军只有一种志愿，即：距北朝鲜军愈远愈妙。美军前线混乱已极，例如某军官刚刚命令士兵下吉普车建立防线，另一军官却下令装载士兵后退。重要的桥梁原认为业已炸毁，结果仍安全无恙。”
    美联社东京七日电引该社驻朝鲜记者韩多曼的报道称：“下面的事实今晨已无法掩饰，即美驻朝鲜军队已狠狠地挨了装备精良、人数众多而又居于主动地位的北朝鲜共产党军队的打击”。该记者也讥笑美官方发表的自相矛盾的公报说：既承认美军已后撤十英里，又说这“只是战术上的撤退”与“改换防线”。韩多曼称：“前线的消息却与此不同。美国军队脱掉他们的鞋子，好更快地逃开追击他们的北朝鲜军队。美军逃得这样快，以至于来不及带着伤兵一道走。有少数的美军为了保命，加入一长串一长串的朝鲜士兵和难民的行列中奔跑了三十五英里的路程。”韩多曼说：“可是东京收到的最后消息还说美军的士气‘高昂无比’，这是抹煞事实。”
    国民党中央社东京七日电也承认：“切断平泽乌山地区美军后路的北朝鲜装甲部队，在步兵支援下直捣距惶恐不安的南朝鲜临时首都（大田）二十英里处的铁路地点”。该电称：“美国伤兵未及运出，韩政府军（指李承晚部队）混乱地溃败下来”。又称：“美军撤退时，在泥深及踝的路上作强行军，精神显得疲惫而忧郁”。（附图片）
