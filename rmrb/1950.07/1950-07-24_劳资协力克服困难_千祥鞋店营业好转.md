　　Labor-Management Cooperation Overcomes Difficulties
    Qianxiang Shoe Store's Business Improves
    [Report from this newspaper] Since Qianxiang Shoe Store in Beijing signed a three-point agreement between labor and management in April of this year – namely, the manager is fully responsible for the factory's business; ten workers were laid off, to be rehired with priority when business improves; and wages, working hours, and labor discipline are based on the Beijing Shoe Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract – labor and management have worked together to improve production. As of the end of June, the factory had made a profit of 5.14 million yuan. The benefits for the labor side have been significantly improved.
