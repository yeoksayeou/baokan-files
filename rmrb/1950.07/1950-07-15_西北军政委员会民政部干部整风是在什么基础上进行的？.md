The anti-unhealthy tendency struggle of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Civil Affairs Department has been underway since March and has achieved considerable success over the past few months, laying a preliminary foundation for the upcoming rectification movement. The progress is reported as follows:

In the early stage of the anti-unhealthy tendency campaign, due to insufficient mobilization, many comrades believed that the Civil Affairs Department had always been relatively resolute and serious in implementing the financial system, and had completely ensured that funds were used for their designated purposes in financial expenditures. Except for a few comrades in affiliated units, no cases of corruption, embezzlement, or serious extravagance and waste had ever been discovered within the department. At the Northwest Regional First-Level Organ Review Conference convened by the Finance Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee in April, the Civil Affairs Department received unanimous praise from everyone. Therefore, most people believed that there were no unhealthy tendencies to combat in the Civil Affairs Department. This ideological resistance affected the unfolding of the movement. After this problem was discovered through investigation, Minister Wang Ziyi personally went deep into the lower levels, convened symposiums with party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and non-party members for discussion and deliberation, comprehensively considered and analyzed the department's overall work and the ideological situation of the cadres, and through various inducements and enlightenments at department meetings and party branch meetings, everyone gradually reached a consensus. The main manifestation of unhealthy tendencies in the department was bureaucratism in leadership work. General appeals were frequent in work, but there was a lack of concrete, in-depth, and systematic inspection; there was impatience, subjectivity, and insufficient democratic style. More prominent was that some leading comrades had a poor mass viewpoint, did not believe in and were not good at developing the abilities of ordinary cadres, and relied solely on themselves to work independently; some committed serious errors of事務主義 (roughly translates as "事務主義" - a focus on routine tasks and administrative details rather than strategic goals), lacked planning in their work, and were busy all day long but failed to grasp the central issues. Secondly, there were many irresponsible phenomena in the work of various departments, such as carelessness, procrastination, and failure to abide by rules. In terms of ideology, although most comrades were able to maintain a style of hard work and plain living, some individual comrades developed arrogance and complacent emotions under the victorious situation and were susceptible to the temptations of urban material life, which was more pronounced in some individual comrades in affiliated units; some veteran cadres, seeing the situation unfolding and the vast new areas needing cadres, held the idea that "promotion from above is slow, while promotion from below is fast," emphasizing their position; new students who joined the work saw that various departments needed people, so they emphasized personal interests in their work, or "the grass is always greener on the other side," demanding a "change of flavor," and so on.

After the problems were discovered, inspections were carried out from top to bottom, focusing on key areas. Minister Wang Ziyi took the lead in conducting a profound self-reflection. Office Director Li Zaizao, Deputy Director of the Cadre Department Nan Shirong, and Director of the Social Affairs Department Bai Zhanyu, and other comrades, frankly and sincerely asked the masses to inspect their work. This dispelled the masses' ideological concerns and greatly promoted the anti-unhealthy tendency struggle. In addition, with the guarantee of the party and the Youth League, everyone took responsibility, advocated free and informal discussions and deliberations, and combined self-reflection with mass inspection, the anti-unhealthy tendency movement developed in depth and achieved the following results:

First, it was unanimously clarified that bureaucratism is the root cause of all errors and shortcomings in the Civil Affairs Department's work, which must be opposed and can certainly be eliminated. This unanimous understanding within and outside the party, and from top to bottom, was obtained through learning, education, review, and practical experience. When Minister Wang conveyed Comrade Xi Zhongxun's report in connection with reality in late May, the cadres' understanding was further improved, and they gradually overcame the tendency to equate the opposition of bureaucratism with individualism and hedonistic tendencies in their studies, laying an ideological foundation for the future rectification movement.

Second, the work has undergone preliminary changes. Although the degree of this change varied in different departments, the experience of empiricism in rural work and the blindness and one-sidedness in inspection work were generally criticized. The lessons of failure educated everyone, and the twenty-odd work teams sent to Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Southern Shaanxi, and Guanzhong in April have all achieved the expected results. For example, the Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai work team has achieved results in understanding the situation and helping lower-level work, and has checked out serious bureaucratism and commandism in Ningxia's work, which has been reported to various places for in-depth inspection; it has reflected the basic situation of the region and the implementation of ethnic policies, and promoted local work. The事務主義 leadership method within the department has begun to change. For example, the Cadre Department in the past did not pay enough attention to the principled issues of grasping and implementing cadre policies and the ideological dynamics of cadres at all levels; it was busy all day filling out forms and conducting investigations, getting entangled in trivial matters such as children, family members, and treatment. After inspection, the leading ideology recognized this problem and began to implement some past regulations and methods based on the new situation. The political consciousness and work enthusiasm of ordinary cadres have also improved, changing the passive phenomenon of dealing with each case as it comes and the mercenary viewpoint of the past, and they can actively study problems and approach the leadership to discuss problems.

Third, criticism and self-criticism have been carried out. In addition to concentrating efforts on checking bureaucratism, the ideological tendencies of pursuing enjoyment of life, liberalism, arrogance and complacency, and lack of progress have also been initially corrected. Non-party workers have also made significant progress. For example, He Zhiyong, a retained employee, said: "Before the anti-unhealthy tendency campaign began, I did not understand the Communist Party, especially the leadership. I dared not criticize them. When I saw that Comrade Zhao Ming (section chief) had written Chairman Peng as Director Peng, and that one thousand big dan of relief grain had been written as ten thousand big dan, I knew it was wrong, but I did not dare to raise it directly, so I adopted a roundabout method. I first asked Zhao Ming to look at it in detail, and then sent it to Deputy Director Feng of the office, but neither of them saw it. It was not until it was submitted to Minister Wang for judgment that it was corrected. After the anti-unhealthy tendency campaign began, I realized that it was very wrong to retain the mercenary viewpoint and backward ideology that I had developed in the old society in the revolutionary camp. In the future, I will definitely be conscientious and responsible, and I will raise any opinions immediately." This unity between party members and non-party members, and between superiors and subordinates, laid the foundation for the future rectification movement.

The shortcomings of this anti-unhealthy tendency struggle are: The branch had blindness in its leadership work, which led to a lack of planning and initiative in the entire movement, and ideological review and work inspection were not well coordinated. Some leading comrades' reviews did not analyze and criticize their own thoughts through errors and shortcomings in their work, but rather connected their work with reviewing their thoughts, so there was not much improvement in their work. Secondly, the work improvement was not comprehensive, because the leading comrades only focused on their own review and relaxed the leadership of the masses to conduct inspections, so some links were moved and some links were not, and it was not possible to fully achieve consistency from top to bottom. Third, the purpose was not clear. The branch only made general appeals at the beginning and failed to grasp the center, so some comrades reflected: "The previous anti-bureaucratism was a guerrilla war, not a war of annihilation."

Currently, in the nationwide party rectification movement, the struggle against bureaucratism has the correct leadership of the party and the foundation that already existed in the previous stage. We have the confidence to ensure that the rectification movement will achieve even greater results.

　　西北军政委员会民政部干部整风是在什么基础上进行的？
    西北军政委员会民政部中共支部
    西北军政委员会民政部的反不良倾向斗争自三月份开始至现在，数月来已获相当成绩，给予目前即将展开的整风运动打下了初步的基础。现将经过情况报道如下：
    在反不良倾向的初期，由于动员不够深入，许多同志认为：民政部在贯彻财政制度上一向是比较坚决严肃的，在财政开支上完全作到了专款专用。除了附属单位的个别同志外，部内从没有发现过贪污腐化和严重的铺张浪费的事实。在四月西北军政委员会财政部召集的西北区一级机关检讨会议上，民政部曾得到大家一致的好评。因此，大多数人认为民政部没有什么不良倾向可反。这种思想上的阻力，影响运动的展开。这一问题经检查发现后，王子宜部长即亲自深入下层，召集党团员和非党同志座谈酝酿，通盘考虑分析该部整个工作及干部的思想情况，并经部务会议，党的支部会议等多方诱导启发，大家意见渐趋一致，认为该部不良倾向的主要表现形式是领导工作中的官僚主义。工作中一般号召多，缺乏具体深入有系统的检查；急躁主观，民主作风不足。比较突出的是有些领导同志群众观点差，不相信与不善于发挥一般干部的能力，单凭自己单刀匹马的干；有的犯了严重的事务主义毛病，工作缺乏计划，整天忙个不了，却抓不住中心。其次是各部门工作中存在许多不负责任的现象，如粗枝大叶，疲踏迟缓，不守制度等。在思想方面：虽大多数同志能保持艰苦朴素的生活和工作作风，但个别同志在胜利局面下却产生了骄傲情绪和经不起城市物质诱惑的享乐思想，在附属单位的个别同志身上表现得比较浓厚些；个别老干部看到局面开展了，广大新区需要干部，“有上边提拔慢，下边提拔快”的地位观念；新参加工作的学生看到各个部门都需要人，在工作中就强调个人兴趣，或“这山看着那山高”，要求“换口味”等。
    问题发现后，即自上而下的，有重点的进行检查。王子宜部长首先带头进行了深刻的反省。办公室主任李在藻、干部处副处长南世荣、社会处处长白占玉等同志，都坦率诚恳地要求群众起来检查工作。这就解除了群众的思想顾虑，对反不良倾向斗争起了很大的推动作用。加上党团保证，大家负责，提倡不拘形式的自由漫谈和酝酿，自我反省与群众检查相结合，使反不良倾向运动深入开展，获得了以下成绩：
    一、一致明确官僚主义是民政部工作中一切错误和缺点的总根子，必须反对，而且一定能够反掉。这个党内外、上下一致的认识是经过学习，教育，检讨与实际体验中才获得的。当五月下旬王部长联系实际传达习仲勋同志的报告以后，干部的认识又提高一步，逐渐克服了学习中将反官僚主义与个人主义、享乐思想倾向平列的偏向，为今后整风运动奠定了思想基础。
    二、工作有了初步转变。这种转变在各部门虽然有程度的不同，但是普遍的批判了下乡工作的经验主义与检查工作中的盲目性与片面性。失败的教训教育了大家，四月以后派赴甘、宁、青、陕南、关中等地的二十几个工作组都收到预期的效果。如甘宁青工作组在了解情况帮助下层工作上已获得成绩，检查出宁夏工作中严重的官僚主义与命令主义，已通报各地深入检查；反映了该地区的基本情况及民族政策执行情况，推动了当地工作。部内事务主义的领导方法开始转变，如干部处过去对掌握与执行干部政策，及各级干部的思想动态等原则性问题注意不够；整天忙于填表调查，纠缠在小孩、家属、待遇等细枝末节上。经过检查，领导思想上认识了这个问题，开始根据新的情况贯彻了已往的一些条例和办法，一般干部政治觉悟与工作积极性也都提高一步，转变了过去交一件办一件的被动现象和雇佣观点，能主动钻研问题，接近领导商量问题。
    三、开展了批评与自我批评。除集中力量检查官僚主义外，还初步纠正了追求生活享受，自由主义，骄傲麻痹，不求进步等思想倾向。非党工作人员也有显著的进步，如留用人员贺稚镛说：“在没有开始反对不良倾向以前，我对共产党不了解，尤其是对领导不敢批评，见赵明同志（科长）将彭主席写成彭主任，救济粮一千大石，写成一万大石，心知不对，而不敢直接提出，便采取转弯办法，先请赵明详看，又送办公室冯副主任看，均未看出。直到呈王部长判行才得纠正。反对不良倾向开始后，我认识到把我在旧社会里养成的那种雇佣观点及落后思想保留在革命阵营中是非常不对的，今后我一定认真负责，有意见马上就提。”这种党内外与上下间的团结，给今后整风运动打下了基础。
    这次反不良倾向斗争的缺点是：支部在领导工作方面存在有盲目性，致使整个运动缺乏计划性、主动性，思想检讨与工作检查还未作到很好地配合。有的领导同志的检讨不是通过工作中的错误与缺点来分析与批判自己的思想，而是从检讨思想去联系工作，这样对工作改进不多。其次是工作改进不全面，因为领导同志只顾自己检讨，放松领导群众来检查，以致有的环节动了，有的环节没动，未能完全做到上下一致。第三是目的不明确。支部在开始时只作了一般号召，抓不住中心，所以有些同志反映：“以前的反官僚主义是游击战，而不是歼灭战。”
    目前在全党整风的运动中，反官僚主义的斗争有党的正确领导，又有前一阶段已有的基础，我们有信心保证整风运动获得更大的成效。
