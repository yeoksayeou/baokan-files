　　Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The American aggressors on the Korean battlefield can no longer conceal their defeat at the hands of the Korean People's Army. According to an AFP dispatch from Washington on the 25th, "News from the Korean front reaching Washington states: Although the US military has modern weapons, it has been surrounded by the North Korean army. The North Korean army is using the 'moving jungle' tactics described in the Bible and Shakespearean tragedies to infiltrate the US military's lines." In this country, the people and the climate are "hostile" to the United States. In view of this situation, "US military authorities are currently preparing public opinion in the United States to admit the fact that the 'United Nations forces in Korea' will soon be forced to hold a very small bridgehead." A US military spokesman declared at Lake Success on the 25th: "MacArthur's army in Korea may have to retreat to a beachhead thirty miles in radius."
　　American armed interventionists are deeply frustrated by their failures in Korea. According to AP reporter Whitehead, in the eyes of Americans, the collapse of the US 24th Infantry Division is an "unfortunate story of encountering a powerful enemy." The reporter said: "It's almost comical to think that a small North Korea could push the US military around in circles. But this is happening and has created a tragic situation."
　　Xinhua News Agency, 29th: According to US News Service, Lake Success: The United Nations Security Council held its fifth illegal meeting since the Korean incident on July 25th, listening to US Chief Representative Austin read the so-called "First Report of the US Government to the Security Council on the Course of Action Taken by the 'Joint Command'." In the report, Austin admitted that the Syngman Rhee army, painstakingly trained by the United States, had been "forced to submit" to the Korean People's Army, thus forcing the war against the People's Army to rely mainly on "aid from countries not only hundreds of miles away, but thousands of miles away."
　　Austin demanded that America's lackeys contribute more troops to fight for the United States, and went on to say that otherwise it was "impossible to predict" when the goals of aggression could be achieved. Austin especially asked Britain to act as cannon fodder for the United States, and he complained that Britain was the "only" country other than the United States "with troops that could be called upon immediately."

　　美国侵略者无法掩饰败绩
    奥斯汀在安理会非法会议上哀鸣  埋怨仆从国家不为美国充当炮灰
    【新华社二十九日讯】在朝鲜战场上的美国侵略者，已再也掩盖不住它被朝鲜人民军打得落花流水的败绩了。据法新社华盛顿二十五日电称：“传至华盛顿的朝鲜前线消息称：美军虽有现代武器，但已被北朝鲜军队包围。北朝鲜军队用圣经与莎士比亚悲剧所描述的‘活动丛林’的方法来渗入美军防线。”在这个国家中，人民和气候都对美国“含有敌意”。鉴于这种情况，“美国军事当局目前正在美国准备舆论，以便承认‘联合国在朝鲜的军队’不久将被迫据守一个很小的桥头堡的这一事实”。美国军事发言人于二十五日在成功湖宣称：“麦克阿瑟在朝鲜的军队也许不得不退至半径三十英里的滩头阵地”。
    美国武装干涉者正为其在朝鲜的失败而懊恼万分。据美联社记者怀特亥说：在美国人看来，美国第二十四步兵师的溃灭经过，是碰到一个“强大的敌人的不幸的故事”。该记者说：“想想一个小小的北朝鲜居然把美国军队推得团团转，简直有点滑稽。但是这样的事正在发生，而且已经造成一种悲惨的局势”。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据美新闻处成功湖讯：联合国安全理事会于七月二十五日举行自朝鲜事件以来第五次的非法会议，听取美国首席代表奥斯汀宣读所谓“美国政府就‘联合司令部’所采取的行动过程提交安理会的第一次报告”。奥斯汀在报告中承认，美国所苦心训练出来的李承晚军队已“被迫屈服”于朝鲜人民军，从而使对人民军的作战，不得不主要地依靠于“不仅在数百英里而且是数千英里以外的国家的援助”。
    奥斯汀要求美国的仆从们贡献出更多的军队去替美国打仗，并接着说：否则什么时候能达成侵略目的，“便无法预言”。奥斯汀特别要求英国为美国充当炮灰，他不满地认为英国是除了美国之外，“唯一具有可以立刻调用的军队”的国家。
