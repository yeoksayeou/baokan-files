Correcting the Tendency to Simply Pursue Quantity
    Tianjin Zhongfang Gauze Quality Improves
    [Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: Since Tianjin Zhongfang factories proposed to correct the tendency of simply pursuing quantity, the quality of products in June has generally improved. In terms of first-class cloth rate, all factories have increased compared to May. For example, Zhongfang No. 1 Factory increased from 98.25% to 98.51%, No. 4 Factory increased from 96.94% to 97.65%, and No. 3 Factory also increased from 99.08% to 99.3%, setting an unprecedented record for Zhongfang factories. The quality of cotton yarn has also improved, especially in factories No. 5 and No. 6. In addition, the yarn breakage rate of looms and spinning frames in each factory has been reduced, and some have exceeded the standards set by the company.
    In order to correct the tendency of simply pursuing quantity that occurred in the production competition in May, Zhongfang Company first revised the percentage of competition items in each factory at the beginning of June, appropriately increasing the proportion of quality in the scoring, so that each factory took improving quality as the goal of their efforts; furthermore, it established and strengthened inspection records and experimental work in each factory, and some factories promptly announced the inspection results, encouraging and stimulating workers to pay attention to quality; in addition, the majority of employees were conscientious and responsible in production, strictly inspected the products of the previous process, and checked each other's work, so the quality of products generally improved.

　　纠正单纯追逐数量偏向
    天津中纺纱布质量提高
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：天津中纺各厂自提出纠正单纯追求数量的偏向后，在六月份产品质量普遍提高。正布率方面，各厂均较五月份上升，如中纺一厂从百分之九十八点二五增为百分之九十八点五一，四厂从百分之九六点九四增为百分之九十七点六五，三厂亦由百分之九十九点○八增为百分之九九点三，创中纺各厂空前纪录。棉纱的质量也见提高，尤以五、六厂最为显著。此外，各厂布机与细纱断头率均已降低，有的已超过公司规定的标准。
    中纺公司为了纠正在五月份生产竞赛中所发生的单纯追求数量的偏向，在六月初首先修订各厂竞赛项目的百分率，适当地提高了质量在评分中所占的比重，使各厂以提高质量作为努力的目标；进一步则在各厂建立和加强了检查记录及试验工作，有些厂并及时公布检查结果，鼓舞与刺激工人重视质量；加之广大职工在生产中认真负责，严格检查前一工序的产品，并互相检查自己的工作，因而产品质量普遍提高。
