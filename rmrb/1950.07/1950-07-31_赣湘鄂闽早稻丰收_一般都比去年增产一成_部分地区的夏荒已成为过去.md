Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th - Early rice in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces in the Central South region has already been harvested. Except for Guangdong, the harvest in the four provinces is generally about 80%, better than last year. Jiangxi Province planted approximately 10 million mu of early rice this year, most of which was plowed three times, harrowed twice, and weeded twice, resulting in an approximately 10% increase in production compared to last year. Hunan Province also planted more early rice this year than last year. Because fertilization, weeding, and other work were better than last year, and despite relatively little rain in Hunan after the start of summer, the early rice harvest was not greatly affected; areas along Dongting Lake even saw an increase of 10% to 15% or more compared to last year. In Hubei Province, the early rice harvest in areas along the Yangtze River, lakes, and marshlands in the Daye, Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Mianyang regions was generally very good, with the Hanchuan area achieving a full harvest. Guangdong Province experienced relatively dry weather this spring, and some rice paddies were converted to planting miscellaneous grains. After the start of summer, some areas of the province also experienced floods, pests, and other disasters. Therefore, except for the Xijiang, Beijiang, and Yuezhong regions, where early rice production remained at last year's level, other areas saw a decrease of approximately 30% compared to last year.

After the early rice harvest in the aforementioned provinces, the summer famine in some areas has ended. Farmers are actively planting late rice. Farmers in Jinggang District, Changsha County, Hunan, have bought back more than 600 head of cattle after selling the new grain; farmers in the Second District of Yuanjiang County have also bought 200 head of cattle. In order to lead farmers in the province to strive for a bumper harvest this autumn, the Hubei Provincial People's Government has distributed a large amount of late rice and buckwheat seeds on credit and called on farmers to plant more late autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th - Fujian Province has also had a bumper harvest of over 10 million mu of early rice, with the highest yield reaching 600 jin per mu and generally around 300-400 jin. Generally, there has been a 10% increase in production compared to last year, with even greater increases in some areas. Terraced fields and Zhou fields, which previously yielded less than 100 jin per mu, have also harvested nearly 300 jin this year. The 60,000 mu of low-lying fields flooded on both banks of the Min River downstream and certain areas of the Zhangzhou region that were slightly affected by excessive spring rains yielded about 50% to 70%, but this exceeded the early rice yield in these areas last year.

Fujian Province had an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest this summer and has now also had a bumper early rice harvest. In addition to the relatively suitable rainfall this year, the major reasons for the bumper harvest are the farmers' hard work under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, increased fertilization, water conservancy construction, pest control, and disaster relief work this spring.

　　赣湘鄂闽早稻丰收
    一般都比去年增产一成
    部分地区的夏荒已成为过去
    【新华社汉口三十日电】中南区江西、湖南、湖北、广东四省早稻已经登场。四省中除广东外，早稻收成一般约为八成，较去年收成为好。江西省今年种早稻约一千万亩，大部都作到了三犁二耙二耘，因此比去年约增产一成。湖南省今年种早稻也较去年为多，因为施肥耘田除草等工作比去年好些，入夏后湖南虽较缺雨，但早稻收成未受很大影响；洞庭湖滨一带还比去年增产了一成到一成半以上。湖北省大冶、黄冈、孝感、沔阳等专区沿江河湖沼地带，早稻收成一般均很良好，汉川地区更获得十成收获。广东省今年春天较旱，部分稻田改种了杂粮。入夏后，该省部分地区又发生过水、虫等灾害，因此除西江、北江、粤中三个地区早稻产量保持了去年的水平外，其余地区约较去年减产三成。
    上述各省收早稻后，部分地区的夏荒已告过去。农民们正在积极种插晚稻。湖南长沙县靖港区农民卖新谷后已买回耕牛六百余头；沅江县二区农民也买了耕牛二百头。湖北省人民政府为着领导该省农民争取今秋丰收，发放了大批晚稻和荞麦贷种，号召农民多种晚秋作物。
    【新华社福州三十日电】福建省的一千余万亩早稻又告丰收，最高产量每亩达六百斤，一般在三、四百斤左右。一般较去年增产一成，个别地区增产更多。往年每亩收成不到一百斤的梯田、洲田，今年也收获近三百斤。闽江下游两岸六万亩被淹洼田及漳州专区某些因春雨过多微受灾害的地区，收获量约五成到七成，但超过这些地区去年的早稻产量。
    福建省今夏曾获得二十年来未有的小麦丰收，现在又获得了早稻丰收。除因今年雨水较为适宜外，农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下努力耕作、增施肥料、兴修水利、防治虫害以及今春的生产救灾等工作，都是获得丰收的重大原因。
