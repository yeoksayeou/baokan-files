　　Labor-Capital Cooperation, Small Profits and Quick Turnover to Overcome Difficulties
    Wanfengyu Grain and Oil Store's Business Improves
    [Report from this newspaper] Wanfengyu Grain and Oil Store in the Second District of this city, through the concerted efforts of labor and capital, working diligently and practicing thrift, and adopting a business strategy of small profits and quick turnover, has overcome the difficulties of insufficient capital turnover and impending closure after more than two months of effort, and its business is trending towards improvement.
    There are forty-three grain, oil, and salt businesses in the Second District, of which more than ten experienced sluggish business and insufficient capital turnover last winter, and Wanfengyu was one of them. After inflation stopped this March, false purchasing power disappeared, and goods became stagnant in the market. Each business partially suspended operations, and the capitalists reported closures or layoffs of employees. Wanfengyu was originally an oil and salt store mainly selling grain and vegetables on consignment. Capitalist Chen Xitang is a propaganda and education committee member of the trade association and is relatively familiar with government policies. In March, when the store was in trouble with insufficient capital turnover, the capitalist took the initiative to explain the unsustainable business situation to the workers, asking everyone to find a way to overcome the current difficulties. Worker Cui Baolin, director of the Second Branch of the Oil, Salt, and Grain Workers' Union, convened all the workers of the store to discuss solutions. The workers proposed: (1) Employees voluntarily suspend wages to strive for improved business; (2) Meals will be changed from two meals of refined grains to coarse grains; (3) Workers will take turns resting. Since implementation, more than 2,300 catties of millet in salaries and 500,000 yuan in food expenses have been saved in more than two months. The capitalist's business method adopted the approach of quick profit-taking and small profits with large sales volumes. The store became more active every day, and the cash flow gradually increased. At the end of May, when accounts were settled, the business situation had improved, the difficulty of insufficient capital turnover had been overcome, and a foundation was laid for future business development. From May onwards, each employee received a temporary advance of 20,000 yuan for expenses, and meals were changed to one meal of coarse grains and one meal of refined grains. After the business improved, the labor side further started to save on electricity, water, and other areas to strive for greater improvement in business. Although the store has not yet established a labor-capital consultation meeting, it has a business review meeting. Every Saturday, labor and capital take turns as chairmen to review the week's business to improve operations. (Lu Zhe)

　　劳资协力薄利多销度过难关
    万丰裕油粮店营业好转
    【本报讯】本市二区油盐粮业万丰裕号，劳资双方同心协力，刻苦节约，采取了薄利多销的营业方针，经两个多月的努力，已度过资金周转不灵、行将歇业的难关，营业趋向好转。
    二区油盐粮业共有四十三家，其中十余家去冬即营业冷落资金周转不灵，万丰裕为其中之一。今年三月通货膨胀停止后，虚假购买力消失，市场货物滞销，各家部分停工，资方纷报歇业或解雇职工。万丰裕本是油盐店以代卖粮食蔬菜为主。资方陈熙堂是同业公会宣教委员比较了解政府政策。三月间，当该号陷于资金周转不灵时，资方主动将营业不支情形向工人提出，请大家设法度过目前难关。工人崔宝林是油盐粮业工会二分会主任，乃召集该号全体工人商量办法。工人方面提出：（一）职工自愿暂停工资，争取营业好转，（二）伙食由两顿细粮改为粗粮，（三）工人轮流歇工。实行以来，两个多月节省了薪资小米二千三百斤，伙食费五十万元。资方营业方式，则采取了快中取利，薄利多销的办法。门市日见活跃，流水逐渐增加。五月末结账时，营业情况已趋好转，资金周转不灵的难关已经度过，且为未来业务开展打下了基础。从五月份起，职工每人暂支两万元零用，伙食则改为粗细粮各一顿。营业好转后劳方更进一步从灯、水等各处着手进行节约，以争取业务更大好转。该号虽尚未成立劳资协商会议，但建有业务检讨会，每星期六由劳资双方作主席，检讨一周业务，以改进经营。（芦哲）
