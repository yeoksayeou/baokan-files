　　Northeast Completes Irrigation Project
    Adding 315,000 Mu of Paddy Fields
    [Our Newspaper, Shenyang] (Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau Communications Group report): More than 40 paddy field irrigation areas in the Northeast provinces completed their spring water conservancy projects on schedule in late May. The sluice gates were opened and water was released, ensuring the water source supply for the newly added 315,000 mu of paddy fields this year.

　　Among the larger irrigation areas constructed in the area this year, the Panshan Farm newly built 140 various larger structures, 2,400 small structures, and 1.34 million cubic meters of earthwork. The Dongliao River irrigation area completed a concrete dam and auxiliary project, 170 larger structures, and 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The Chahayang irrigation area newly built 20 kilometers of the eastern trunk line, with 820,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The others are medium and small irrigation areas, a total of 40, building approximately 3,100 various large and small structures, excavating a total of 3.6 million cubic meters of earthwork. Due to the basic completion of the above-mentioned major projects, the expanded and restored paddy field area in major irrigation areas has reached 18,000 hectares. Adding the newly increased paddy fields in various small irrigation areas, the task of increasing paddy fields by 315,000 mu this year has been completed.

　　Due to seasonal restrictions, the spring construction period in the area was extremely short, and there were not many technical cadres. However, water conservancy agencies at all levels, technical cadres, and workers closely cooperated and overcame many difficulties, finally completing the task on schedule and opening the sluice gates to release water without delaying agricultural work.

　　Currently, approximately 300,000 hectares of paddy fields in Northeast China have been successively irrigated. This year, the river flow rates are generally more abundant than in previous years, and all rice fields have survived the dry season in May. With increased rainfall and higher river levels in the future, the water supply for rice fields can be guaranteed. A bumper harvest of paddy fields in the area is expected this year.

　　东北完成灌溉工程
    新增水田三十一万五千亩
    【本报沈阳讯】东北水利总局通讯小组报道：东北各省四十余处水田灌溉区，今年春修水利工程已于五月下旬按时完成，启闸放水，保证了今年新增加的三十一万五千亩水田的水源供应。
    该区今年兴修的较大灌溉区有盘山农场，新修各种较大建筑物一百四十座，小建筑物二千四百座，土方一百三十四万公方。东辽河灌溉区完成了混凝土拦河坝及附属工程一项，较大的建筑物一百七十座，土方三十万公方。查哈阳灌溉区新修东干线二十公里，土方八十二万公方。其他为中、小灌溉区，共四十个，兴修各种大、小建筑物约三千一百座，共挖土方三百六十万公方。由于基本上完成了上述主要工程，各大灌溉区增开及恢复水田面积已达一万八千垧，再加各小型灌溉区的新增水田，今年增加水田三十一万五千亩任务已告完成。
    该区因受季节限制，春工时间极短，同时技术干部不多，但各级水利机关、技术干部和工人密切结合，克服了重重困难，终于按时完成任务，启闸放水，未误农时。
    目前东北约三十多万垧水田，已先后放水灌田。今年各河水流量普遍较往年充足，所有稻田均已度过了五月枯水时期。今后雨量增多，河水较大，稻田用水可保无虞。今年该区水田丰收有望。
