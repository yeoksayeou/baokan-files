Beijing News Agency Report: The spring agricultural loan program in the Beijing suburbs has been basically completed. This loan has played a significant role in helping liberated peasants solve the difficulty of lacking means of production and completing this year's plan to increase agricultural production in the suburbs by 10%.

The loan work was jointly carried out by the Municipal Government Suburban Committee, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, and the district governments of the suburbs. The loan types include fertilizer, seeds, farm tools, livestock, well digging, and six types of sideline production, a total of eleven categories. The main targets of the loan are newly liberated peasants and other peasants who are actively engaged in production but have difficulties.

From the beginning of March to the end of May this year, the eight districts in the Beijing suburbs have completed more than 82% of the total loan plan (4.5 million jin of millet), totaling more than 3.69 million jin of millet. Among them, the 17th district completed the largest number, accounting for 91.11% of the total amount arranged for the district; the 18th district completed the smallest number, accounting for 63.44% of the total amount arranged.

The 13th and 19th districts did the best in this loan work. They were able to purchase seeds and fertilizers collectively through cooperatives in a planned way with loans, and uniformly order farm tools. This can not only save manpower for the peasants and reduce exploitation, but also avoid the tendency of individual households wasting loans that are not used for production. For example, the farm tool loan in Wulituo Village, 19th district, was a total of 1,000 jin of millet. The village cooperative organized the households that needed to borrow farm tools and signed a contract with the village blacksmith shop, stipulating the price, quantity, delivery, payment, repair, and other methods. A total of 41 large and small farm tools were made, and the millet saved on large hoes alone amounted to 300 jin. Therefore, the peasants said, "This method is really good, it saves trouble and money." The fertilizer loan in Dongba Town, 13th district, was a total of 10,000 jin of millet. As a result of organizing collective fertilizer purchases, more than 10,000 jin of manure were purchased. Madiao Village, 14th district, received a well-drilling loan and originally planned to dig six wells. After unified surveying and careful calculation by the well-drilling workers, eight wells were dug.

The peasants in various districts have responded very well to this loan from the government. The peasants in Xiaohongmen, Paifang and other villages in the 14th district said, "The government called on us to plant early-maturing crops and provided a large number of loans, mainly to let us get started early, which is a really good method." The liberated peasants in the 18th district, who had just been allocated land, lacked means of production. After receiving the loans, they were all happy and said, "The government takes such good care of us, we must complete the spring plowing on schedule and ensure a 10% increase in production."

At the beginning of this loan work, there were also some deviations, mainly that some places did not follow the actual needs of the peasants and used the method of equal distribution to issue loans. For example, 250 jin of millet in Bagou Village were distributed equally, with each household receiving 5 jin. During the loan process, some cadres did not grasp the timeliness well, and after the loan, they did not carry out strict supervision and inspection. As a result, some peasants did not use the loans for production. For example, Wang Yongquan, the deputy village chief of Laodian Village, 19th district, received a loan of broad bean seeds. Because the planting season had not yet arrived, he was experiencing financial difficulties at the time, so he ate all the loans he received. In other cases, such as some village cadres in the 16th district were afraid that poor peasants would not be able to repay the loans on time, there was a tendency to favor middle peasants during the loans. These deviations were discovered by the Municipal Government Suburban Committee, which instructed all districts to conduct a general inspection and have been promptly corrected.

### 帮助翻身农民解决生产困难  京郊春贷工作基本完成

　　帮助翻身农民解决生产困难
    京郊春贷工作基本完成
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊春季农业贷款现已基本完成。这次贷款，对帮助翻身农民解决缺乏生产资料的困难，完成今年郊区农业增产一成的计划，起了很大的作用。
    贷款工作是由市府郊委会、市供销合作总社、人民银行北京分行及郊区各区政府等有关单位共同进行的。贷款种类包括肥料、种籽、农具、牲畜、打井和六项副业生产等共十一种；贷款主要对象是新翻身的农民及其他生产积极而有困难的农民。
    自今年三月初开始到五月底止。京郊八个区已完成贷款计划总额（四百五十万斤小米）的百分之八十二以上，共折合小米三百六十九万多斤。其中以第十七区完成数字最大，占该区布置总额的百分之九一·一一；十八区完成的数字较小，占布置总额百分之六三·四四。
    这次贷款以第十三、十九区办的最好，都能通过合作社有计划地以贷款集体购买种籽肥料，统一订制农具。这样，既可使农民们节省人力，少受剥削，又可避免个别户浪费贷款不用于生产上的偏向。如十九区五里坨村的农具贷款共为一千斤小米，村合作社将需要贷农具的各户组织起来，和该村铁匠炉订立了合同，规定了价格、分量、交货、交款、修理等办法，共打大小农具四十一件，仅只大锄一项，就省米三百斤；因此，农民们都说：“这办法真好，又省事，又省钱。”十三区东坝镇肥料贷款共为一万斤小米，由于组织集体购肥，结果多买进粪肥一万多斤。十四区马道村领到了水井贷款，原计划能打六眼井，经过打井工人统一勘测，精打细算，结果打了八眼井。
    各区农民对政府这次贷款反映都很好。十四区小红门、牌坊等村的农民说：“政府号召种早熟庄稼，贷给大批款子，主要是让咱们早接口，真是好办法。”十八区的翻身农民新分到土地，正缺乏生产资料，领到贷款后都高兴地说：“政府这样照顾咱们，一定要按期完成春耕，保证增产一成。”
    这次贷款工作开始时，也曾发生一些偏向，主要是有的地方没有按照农民实际需要，而用平均分配的办法发放贷款，如巴沟村二百五十斤小米平均分配，每户得五斤；在贷款时，有的干部没有很好地掌握时间性，贷款之后，又没进行严格的督促检查。以致有的农民没把贷款用于生产上，如十九区老店村的副村长王永泉得到扁豆籽贷款，因为还没有到种的季节，当时生活困难，就把领到的贷款吃光了。其他如十六区的个别村干部怕贫农不能按时归还贷款，贷款时曾发生偏向中农的现象。这些偏向，经市府郊委会发现后，曾指示各区普遍进行检查，已经及时纠正。
