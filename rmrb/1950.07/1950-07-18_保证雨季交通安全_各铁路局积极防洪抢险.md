　　Ensuring Traffic Safety During the Rainy Season
    Various Railway Bureaus Actively Prevent Floods and Conduct Emergency Repairs
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government issued an order on May 11 to actively strengthen flood prevention work, railway bureaus in various regions established flood prevention organizations, accelerated the construction of flood prevention projects, and carried out flood prevention preparations. In some areas where water damage occurred, workers bravely carried out emergency repairs to minimize the time of traffic interruption.
    Currently, flood prevention organizations have been widely established in various regions. Taking the Northeast as an example, the Railway Ministry's Northeast Special Commissioner's Office established a water damage emergency repair headquarters; each Railway Administration established a water damage emergency repair headquarters, with directly subordinate emergency repair teams for flexible deployment; each Railway Sub-bureau established emergency repair sub-divisions; and each Engineering Section established emergency repair teams.
    Flood prevention projects are now being accelerated in various regions. The Tianjin Railway Bureau began constructing flood prevention projects in April. The large and small bridges and culvert projects on various lines under the bureau's jurisdiction have been largely completed or are nearing completion through the efforts of the commanders and fighters of the Railway Engineering Corps and the employees of various engineering sections; the construction of revetments and retaining walls has resulted in seventeen completed or under construction. The Zhengzhou Bureau has listed flood prevention as the central task of the second phase of the project. The three most dangerous flood protection projects on the Longhai Line are also under vigorous construction. The most serious is at kilometer 891 of the Shanzhou section of the Longhai Line, where the main stream of the Yellow River is only ten meters away from the line, with steep walls forty meters high, and the riverbank is sandy and loose. The river is very dangerous when the current is rapid. With the guidance of Soviet experts and the emergency repair work of Railway Engineering Corps soldiers, by June 24, the project to throw 50,000 cubic meters of riprap to protect the riverbank had completed 60% of the plan. Another key point of the Zhengzhou Bureau's flood prevention project is the reinforcement of the second pier of the Anyang River Bridge, which was successfully completed on June 12. The Jinzhou Bureau has set a deadline for the completion of bridge and protection projects on the entire line.
    While accelerating the construction of flood prevention projects, various regions have universally heightened vigilance and made efforts to prepare for flood prevention. Railway workers in various regions have universally studied the "Water Damage Handling" and technical management regulations; flood prevention materials, tools, emergency repair trains, etc. have been prepared to be transported to designated locations in a timely manner; and close contact has been maintained with local water conservancy authorities to check water volume in a timely manner.
    In some areas where water damage has occurred, workers have bravely carried out emergency repair struggles. In general, traffic can be restored within 24 hours. In May, 37 water damage accidents occurred on the Xiang-Gui-Qian Line; 11 water damage accidents occurred west of Shangrao on the Zhe-Gan Line. The Daling River Bridge on the Jin-Gu Line in Northeast China was washed away in early June, causing an eight-hour traffic stoppage; the Liao-Xi Line also suffered three water damage incidents due to mountain floods in early June. By July 4, the Tianjin Railway Bureau's entire line had suffered a total of 26 cases of water damage and flooding, 25 of which occurred on the Jing-Bao Line under the jurisdiction of the Zhangjiakou Sub-bureau. During the heavy rains on July 3 and 4, more than 30 sections of roadbed and bridges on the entire Jinan Bureau's line were damaged. In severe cases, the roadbed subsided, floods overflowed the rail surface, and bridge foundations were washed away, causing traffic interruptions in some areas.
    The rainy season has now arrived, and flood prevention work has entered a period of alert. Various regions must strengthen their sense of responsibility, heighten their vigilance, and actively prepare to overcome floods and ensure the safety of railway transportation.

　　保证雨季交通安全
    各铁路局积极防洪抢险
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部于五月十一日发布了积极加强防水工作的命令以后，各地铁路局纷纷建立防洪组织，加紧修建防洪工程，进行防洪准备。若干发生了水害的地区，职工们便英勇地进行抢险，尽量缩短交通中断的时间。
    现在各地防洪组织已普遍建立。以东北为例，铁道部驻东北特派员办事处成立水害抢修司令部；各管理局成立水害抢修总部，下设直属抢修队，机动调用；各分局成立抢修分部；各工务段成立抢修队。
    各地防水工程现正加紧修建。天津铁路局于四月间即开始修建防水工程。该局所属各线大小桥梁、涵洞工程，经铁道兵团指战员及各工务段员工努力修复加固，现大部已完成，有的接近完成；护坡及挡土墙的兴修，已完成的和已开工的有十七件。郑州局把防洪列为第二期工程中心任务。该局陇海线上最险恶的三处水患防护工程也正在大力修建，其中最严重的是陇海线陕州段八九一公里处，黄河主流距线路仅十公尺，壁陡高四十公尺，河岸沙多质松，河水急流时非常危险。该处经苏联专家指导和铁道兵团战士抢修，到六月二十四日止，抛五万公方片石以防护岸脚的工程计划已完成百分之六十。郑州局防水工程的另一重点是安阳河桥第二墩的加固工程，在六月十二日已胜利完成。锦州局全线的桥梁及防护工程已限期完成。
    各地在加紧修建防水工程的同时，普遍提高警惕性，努力做了防洪准备工作。各地铁路职工普遍学习了“水害处理”及技术管理规程；把防洪材料、工具、抢修列车等准备好，以便及时运送到指定地点；与当地水利机关密切联系，及时检查水量情况。
    在已经发生水害的若干地区，职工们英勇进行抢修斗争。一般都能做到在二十四小时之内修复通车。五月份，湘桂黔线发生水害事故三十七件；浙赣线仅上饶以西就发生水害事故十一处。东北锦古线的大凌河桥在六月初被水冲毁，停车八小时；辽溪线也因山洪瀑发，在六月初发生三次水害。天津铁路局全线到七月四日止，共发生二十六件水害和水患，其中二十五件是张家口分局所辖京包线发生的。济南局全线在七月三、四两日大雨中，有三十多处路基和桥梁被毁。严重的地方，路基下沉，洪水漫过轨面，桥基冲毁，以致部分地区一度交通中断。
    目前雨季已经来临，防洪工作已进入警备时期，各地必须加强责任心，提高警惕性，积极准备，以战胜洪水，保证铁路运输安全。
