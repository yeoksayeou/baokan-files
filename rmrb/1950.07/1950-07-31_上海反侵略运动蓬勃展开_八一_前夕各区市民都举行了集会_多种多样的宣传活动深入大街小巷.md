Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 30th: On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the people of Shanghai are vigorously launching a movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. In the past few days, citizens in all 30 districts of the city have held rallies against American aggression. Various forms of propaganda teams have been active on major roads from morning till night. The Penglai District alone dispatched 84 propaganda teams and 120 cartoon teams, with more than 3,000 people participating. Huge slogans and propaganda pictures were universally hung on major buildings and traffic arteries throughout the city. The International Hotel, the tallest building in the Far East, hung a huge slogan measuring twelve zhang in length and one zhang and two chi in width, which read: "People of the World, Unite Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea." Major companies and shops displayed maps of the Korean War of Liberation in their windows. Newspapers throughout the city devote huge space every day to reporting the victories of the Korean People's Army and commentaries, special articles, poems, and cartoons against American imperialist aggression. Loudspeakers at major traffic arteries throughout the city broadcast calls against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea.

The movement against American aggression has widely penetrated the neighborhoods. Students from Jiaotong University organized more than 40 propaganda teams, held more than 50 residents' meetings in various larger neighborhoods in the Xuhui District, with more than 18,000 residents participating. Neighborhoods throughout the city also widely use the cool evening hours to hold cool-off chats, conducting propaganda activities to the masses.

The people of Shanghai are adopting a variety of methods to carry out propaganda in this movement. Students from St. John's University and employees of the Bureau of Public Works held exhibitions of pictures of American aggression in Taiwan and Korea in Zhongshan and Huangpu Parks, and held anti-aggression rallies for tourists. Farmers in the Jiangwan District voluntarily organized propaganda teams to conduct巡回propaganda in various villages. Conductors of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Traffic Section report the war reports of the Korean People's Army to passengers on the train at any time. The Shanghai International Radio Station Union and employees of the state-owned pharmaceutical industry printed propaganda slogans against American aggression on every telegram paper and on the bottom of medicine packaging. The Putuo District divided the entire district into 11 propaganda areas, with factories in each area as the main force, to carry out in-depth propaganda activities. When the workers of the Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory conducted propaganda, they held up a huge "Missing Person" advertisement, which read: Missing Person: Dean, former commander of the 24th Division of the Eighth Army of the United States Army invading Korea. Occupation: War criminal. Place of disappearance: Daejeon, Korea.

In the movement against American aggression, the vast majority of citizens are infinitely angry at the crimes of American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, and have expressed that they will definitely take practical actions to oppose American imperialism's aggression and defend world peace. At the military-civilian get-together, combat heroes Wei Laiguo and Wang Li resolutely expressed their determination to intensify military training and prepare to liberate Taiwan. At a military-civilian get-together of more than 10,000 people in Hudong, Gong Jinmei, a female worker at a cotton mill and a first-class meritorious worker, swore on behalf of the workers in the entire Hudong District: determined to step up production and support the front line.

　　上海反侵略运动蓬勃展开
    “八一”前夕各区市民都举行了集会
    多种多样的宣传活动深入大街小巷
    【新华社上海三十日电】在中国人民解放军“八一”建军节的前夕，上海人民汹涌澎湃地展开反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动。几天来，全市三十个区市民都分别举行了反对美国侵略的集会。各主要马路从早至晚流动着各种形式的宣传队，仅蓬莱区即出动了八十四个宣传小组、一百二十个漫画队，人数在三千人以上。全市各高楼大厦、交通要道普遍悬挂了巨幅标语和宣传图画。远东第一高楼国际饭店高悬长达十二丈、阔达一丈二尺的巨幅标语，上面写着：“全世界人民团结起来，反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜。”各大公司、大商号都在橱窗内张挂着朝鲜解放战争形势图。全市报纸每天皆用巨大的篇幅，报道朝鲜人民军的捷报和反对美帝侵略的评论、专论、诗歌和漫画。全市各交通要道播音机播送着反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜的呼声。
    反对美国侵略运动已普遍深入了里弄，交通大学学生组织了四十多个宣传队，到徐汇区各个较大的里弄中，召开了五十多个居民大会，参加开会的居民达一万八千多人。全市各里弄并广泛地利用晚间乘凉的时间，召开乘凉漫谈会，向群众进行宣传活动。
    上海市人民在这一运动中采取多种多样的方法进行宣传。圣约翰大学学生、工务局员工在中山、黄浦等公园内，举行美国侵略台湾朝鲜图片展览，并召开游客反侵略集会。江湾区农民自动组织了宣传队，到各乡村巡回宣传。上海铁路局车务段乘务员，在火车上随时向旅客报告朝鲜人民军的战报。上海国际电台工会和国药业职工们，在每份电报纸上和包药的包皮底上，印上反对美国侵略的宣传标语。普陀区把全区划分为十一个宣传区，以各区工厂为主，展开深入的宣传活动。大新染织厂职工在宣传时，举着巨幅的“寻人”广告，上边写着：失踪者：曾任美国侵略朝鲜陆军总司令第八军二十四师师长迪安。职业：战犯。失踪地点：朝鲜大田。
    在反对美国侵略的运动中，广大市民对于美国侵略台湾朝鲜的罪行，无限愤怒，纷纷表示一定以实际行动来反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平。在军民联欢会上，战斗英雄魏来国、王立和坚决表示要加紧练兵，准备解放台湾。在沪东万余人的军民联欢会上，一等功臣纱厂女工龚金妹代表全沪东区工人宣誓：决心加紧生产，支援前线。（附图片）
