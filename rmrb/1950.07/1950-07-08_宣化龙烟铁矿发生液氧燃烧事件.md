　　Liquid Oxygen Combustion Incident at Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine
　　[Report from this newspaper] On June 13th at 2 PM, a liquid oxygen combustion incident occurred at the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, which is under the jurisdiction of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau. Seven employees died and seven were injured. The day after the incident, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Government Administration Council, along with the responsible authorities such as the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, sent people to investigate and assist the mine in handling the aftermath. The deceased employees have been coffined and buried, and the seriously and lightly injured employees are being sent to hospitals in Beijing and Xuanhua for medical treatment, respectively. After the Longyan Iron Mine's oxygen plant resumed production on May 1st last year, due to poor sales of oxygen, the plant director, Wang Deheng, began to experiment with liquid oxygen explosives. From November 28th of last year to June 12th of this year, after 18 trials, initial success was achieved. On June 10th, during the 17th test at the Yantongshan Iron Mine, 46 rolls of 24 cm thick charcoal powder were used to blast down 14 tons of iron sand, which was closer to the effect of the ammonium nitrate explosives used in the mine. According to the mine's estimate, the use of this explosive could reduce the cost of explosives per ton of iron sand by four-fifths. This incident occurred during the 19th test, during transportation. At about 2 PM on the 13th, Wang Deheng, the director of the oxygen plant, led 22 employees in a medium-sized jeep, carrying about 40 kilograms of liquid oxygen, from Xuanhua city to the Yantongshan Iron Mine, about 20 miles away. When the car reached Shaojiawan, about five miles north of Xuanhua city, and was going down a small hill, the liquid oxygen container burst, and a fire immediately started. Employees Fang Shizhen, Wang Guicai, Li Jingyuan, Chen Guohua, Kang Fuxiang, Zhu Huaiqing, and others died one after another due to severe injuries. Employees Li Gongfu and Zhao Lianshi, who suffered serious injuries, have come to Beijing and been admitted to Beijing Hospital for treatment. The plant director, Wang Deheng, and workers Liu Jun, Li Ying, Zhang He, and driver Li Gang, who suffered minor injuries, are receiving treatment locally. The cause of the liquid oxygen container bursting is currently under detailed investigation.

　　宣化龙烟铁矿发生液氧燃烧事件
    【本报讯】六月十三日下午二时，钢铁工业局所属宣化龙烟铁矿发生液体氧气燃烧事件，职工死七名，伤七名。事件发生后的第二天，政务院人民监察委员会及重工业部、钢铁工业局等主管机关，便派人前去调查，并协助该矿进行善后事宜。死亡职工已装殓埋葬，重伤、轻伤职工正分别送北京、宣化两地医院医疗。龙烟铁矿氧气厂于去年五月一日复工生产以后，因为氧气销路不好，该厂王德恒厂长便着手试制液体氧气炸药。自去年十一月二十八日至今年六月十二日，先后经过十八次试验，已获初步成功。六月十日于烟筒山铁矿场作第十七次试验时，以重二十四公分的炭粉四十六卷，炸下铁砂十四吨，和该矿场所用硝胺炸药的效果更加接近。据该矿估计，使用此种炸药可使每吨铁砂的炸药成本减低五分之四。此次事件发生于第十九次试验的运输途中。十三日下午二时许，该矿氧气厂厂长王德恒，率领职工二十二人，乘一中型吉普车，携带约四十公斤的液体氧气，由宣化城向二十里外的烟筒山铁矿场驶去。到宣化城北五里左右的邵家湾，车子走过一个小土丘往下走的时候，液氧容器涨破，随即起火。职工方世珍、王贵才、李景元、陈国华、亢福祥、朱怀清等七人，因伤势过重，先后不治身死。身受重伤的职工李公甫、赵联士，已来京入北京医院医治。受轻伤的该厂厂长王德恒，工人刘君、李英、张河及汽车司机李刚等，正就地治疗。液氧容器涨破原因现正在详细研究。
