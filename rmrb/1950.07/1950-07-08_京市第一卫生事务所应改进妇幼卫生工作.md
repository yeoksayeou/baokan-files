The First Health Clinic in Beijing Should Improve Maternal and Child Health Work
Editor:

The First Health Clinic in Beijing has been established for twenty-five years, with relatively complete equipment and a large scale. Since liberation, although the work of the clinic has made some progress, it is still far from enough. Here, I would like to offer some suggestions on several maternal and child health work systems of the clinic:

First, the clinic has a "reservation system." That is, some pregnant women who come to the clinic for examination must first make a reservation at the registration office (that is, make an appointment for a date), otherwise they will not be examined. This system makes it difficult for working people who have little money and time. They take time out of their busy schedules to come from afar, but they cannot enjoy prenatal check-ups and have to go back disappointed.

Another system is that they will not provide delivery services unless they have examined the pregnant woman before delivery. This is very inappropriate. Because regular check-ups for pregnant women are very necessary, but ensuring safety during delivery is our responsibility. We must not ignore the life or death of pregnant women simply because they have not been examined by us before delivery, but should actively carry out publicity and education to mobilize them to understand the importance of prenatal check-ups.

Their postpartum home visits are also very inadequate. Some women have had four children delivered by them, but they still do not know how to properly care for their babies, such as bathing and breastfeeding.

Some mothers said: "The young ladies are so clean that they have to spread a sterilized sheet before putting on their coats." When they leave, they take a rickshaw, and the fare is paid by the mother, which gives the masses a very bad impression.

In addition, their publicity and education on women and children's health focuses on form rather than effect. For example, when conducting education in the waiting room, they use a lot of medical terms, such as umbilical cord, blood, circulation, nutrition, etc., which makes it difficult for the masses to understand and does not achieve good results.

Editor, please publish my comments in the newspaper.

### 京市第一卫生事务所应改进妇幼卫生工作

　　京市第一卫生事务所应改进妇幼卫生工作编者同志：
    北京市第一卫生事务所，自创办迄今已有二十五年，设备较完善，规模也很大。解放后，该所的工作虽有了某些进步，但仍非常不够。这里，我仅对该所的几个妇幼卫生工作制度，提出一些意见：
    第一、该所有一种“预约制度”。就是有些孕妇到所请求检查，先到挂号处预约（即所谓订日子），否则不予检查。这个制度，就苦了那些少钱没时间的劳动人民。他们在百忙中抽暇由远道而来，但却享受不到产前检查，只好失望地回去。
    另一种制度是产前不经他们检查，概不接产。这是很不妥当的。因为孕妇按期检查，固是非常必要，但保证生产时的安全，更是我们的责任。我们决不能因孕妇产前未经我们检查，便不管她的死活，而应积极开展宣传教育动员工作，使她们懂得产前检查的重要性。
    产后的访视工作，他们作的也非常不够。有的妇女虽然经他们接产过四个孩子，但对婴儿的一般照料，如洗澡、哺乳等仍然做得不合理。
    有的产妇说：“小姐们真干净，放大衣还得铺张消毒纸。”他们临走时要坐三轮车，车钱是产妇付的，给群众以极不好的影响。
    此外，他们对妇婴卫生宣传教育，重形式而不重效果，如进行候诊教育时，满口医学名词，如脐带、血液、循环、营养等，使群众难以接受，收不到良好的效果。
    编者同志，请把我的意见在报上发表。
