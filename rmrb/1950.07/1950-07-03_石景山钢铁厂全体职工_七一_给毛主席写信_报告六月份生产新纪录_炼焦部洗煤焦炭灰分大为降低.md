　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant All Employees
    “July 1st” Letter to Chairman Mao Reporting New Production Records in June
    Washing Coal Ash Content Greatly Reduced in Coking Department
    [Our Dispatch] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a meeting on the evening of July 2nd to commemorate "July 1st". At the meeting, it was decided to write a letter to Chairman Mao reporting the new production records in June. The original text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    Today, we are holding a meeting to commemorate the Party's birthday - "July 1st." Thinking of how, under your leadership in the past year, our lives have become happier and production has greatly increased, we reported these situations to Commander-in-Chief Zhu when he came to the factory. On "May 1st," we greatly heard you shout "Long live the comrades of the Iron and Steel Plant!" on the Tiananmen Rostrum! Everyone was extremely happy! On the day we returned to the factory, we resolved that we must actively produce and run the factory well under your call and the leadership of the Party to report to you.
    After the "May 1st" production increase competition, we launched a new record movement in June. Trade union groups and individuals universally developed planning, workshops signed contact contracts with each other, and rationalization proposals formed a craze throughout the factory. The production tasks for June were all completed and exceeded. Pig iron production exceeded the original plan by 13 percent, and the quality improved to the point where first and second grade iron accounted for more than 98 percent of the entire product. None of the other iron was unqualified, and the average ash content of coke was reduced to 16.23 percent, exceeding the task by 4.5 percent. In terms of cast pipe production, the task was exceeded by 1.9 percent, and in terms of quality, the average of qualified products was above 90 percent. The power department operated safely, and no accidents occurred in a month. The number of accidents in the transportation department was reduced from seven in January to one. The supply room cleared out a lot of off-book materials in this material clearing movement: the iron furnace parts alone numbered 9,383. The scrap rate of the foundry in the repair department was reduced to 4.5 percent. The planned timeframe for the second blast furnace structure project was two months, but in fact, 70 percent was completed in one month. In addition, there are many other new records that will not be reported one by one.
    What we particularly want to report to you is that in order to welcome "July 1st," the coking department, with the efforts of all employees, created a new record of reducing the ash content of washed coal from 12.5 percent to 9.45 percent, and the ash content of coke from 17 percent to 13.08 percent. The ash content of coke was even 3.92 percent lower than the standard stipulated by the higher authorities, exceeding the task by 23 percent. According to calculations, for every 1 percent reduction in coke ash content, iron production should increase by 3 percent. This is of great significance for reducing the cost of iron. This good news was written on red posters by the employees of the coking department this morning and entrusted to our factory director Zhou to forward to you.
    We are not satisfied with this achievement, nor are we proud. We must remember your words: "Guard against arrogance and rashness." We are determined to consolidate existing achievements under the leadership of the Party and you, create more new records in the new record movement, run the iron and steel plant well, and respond to your call: "Strive to achieve a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation!"
    We wish you good health!
    All employees of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    July 2nd

　　石景山钢铁厂全体职工
    “七一”给毛主席写信  报告六月份生产新纪录
    炼焦部洗煤焦炭灰分大为降低
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂七月二日晚召开了纪念“七一”大会，会上通过决定给毛主席写信报告六月份生产中的新纪录。原文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    今天我们开会纪念党的生日——“七一”，想起一年来在你的领导下，我们的日子过的快活了，生产大大提高了，这些情况，朱总司令来厂时我们报告过他。“五一”那天，大大听到你在天安门楼上高喊“钢铁厂同志们万岁！”大家高兴极啦！那天回厂我们就下了决心，一定要在你的号召和党的领导下积极生产，搞好工厂来报告你。
    我们在“五一”增产竞赛后，六月份起就展开新纪录运动。工会小组和个人普遍展开订计划，车间之间订立了联系合同，合理化建议在全厂形成热潮，六月份的生产任务都完成并且超过了。生铁产量超过原订计划的百分之十三，质量提高到一、二号铁占整个产品的百分之九十八以上。其他的铁也没有不合规格的，焦炭灰分平均降低到百分之一六点二三，超过任务百分之四点五。铸管的产量方面超过任务百分之一点九，质量方面合规格的平均在百分之九十以上。动力部的安全运转，在一个月内没有发生过事故。运输部事故由一月份的七次减到一次。供应室在这次清理物资运动中清理出不少账外物资：仅炼铁炉炉件就有九、三八三件。修理部翻砂的废品率降低到百分之四点五。第二炼铁炉房架子工程计划是两个月完成，而实际上一个月就完成了百分之七十。此外还有许多新纪录不一一报告了。
    特别要报告你的，就是为了迎接“七一”，炼焦部在全体职工努力下创造了洗煤灰分从百分之一二点五降到百分之九点四五，焦炭灰分从百分之十七降到百分之一三点○八的新纪录，焦炭灰分比上级规定的标准还降低了百分之三点九二，超过任务百分之二三，根据计算焦炭灰分每降低百分之一，铁产量就应增加百分之三。这对降低铁的成本是有很大作用的。这个喜讯，今天早上炼焦部职工们已写了红喜帖托我们的周厂长转给你。
    我们对这个成绩并不满足，也不骄傲，一定记住你的话：“戒骄戒躁”，决心在党和你的领导下，巩固既有的成绩，在新纪录运动中创造更多的新纪录，把钢铁厂搞好，响应你的号召：“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争！”
    祝你身体健康！
    石景山钢铁厂全体职工
    七月二日
