(Shenyang News) According to the Northeast Daily, the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau held its third water conservancy conference from the 3rd to the 9th of this month. Representatives from 11 units attended, including the Dongliao River Water Conservancy Bureau, water conservancy bureaus of various provinces, Panshan Farm, the Suburban Affairs Office of Shenyang City, the Northeast Regional Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways, and the West Liao River Water Conservancy Bureau of Inner Mongolia. The meeting was imbued with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, summarizing and reviewing the construction of water conservancy projects in the first half of the year, and specifically discussing and arranging summer flood control work.

The main shortcomings in the construction work of various regions in the first half of the year were an emphasis on quantity over quality. Although the number of projects exceeded the targets and quality improved, the quality was still far from the prescribed standards. Many shortcomings and errors in the project design and planning not only wasted a huge amount of state funds, but also directly led to the low quality of the projects. For example, in the levee construction projects, some cross-sections were insufficient and the filling was too loose to prevent flooding. The breach of the Beisha River in Liaoyang in June was one such example. In irrigation projects, the construction of structures was perfunctory, and the concrete could not reach the intended safety level. The filling was not compacted, making it prone to collapse. In water management projects, some levee line designs were unreasonable, some were wide and narrow, and some had excessively sharp bends, hindering flood discharge. The water conservancy project plan of Yingkou Farm in Liaodong Province was changed three or four times, and it was finalized only two days before construction began, making it difficult for management to coordinate.

In his summary, Wei Zhaolin, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, made a self-criticism on behalf of the bureau regarding these projects. The main problem was insufficient planning, failing to grasp the main link of project planning, and failing to propose feasible plans and procedures based on specific circumstances. At the same time, the water conservancy construction policy proposed at the water conservancy conference in January of this year was not clear enough, failing to specify what kind of construction should be done under what circumstances. As a result, in river management, regardless of large or small rivers, upstream or downstream, people "built dikes along every river" and "planted trees at every bend," which increased the difficulty of draining internal water and protecting dikes. Secondly, the bureau's technical guidance was also not timely. During the spring repair, a large number of technical cadres were distributed to several major project areas to help with construction. Due to a lack of technical personnel to conduct on-site inspections of the projects sent by other regions for review, it was difficult to give timely and affirmative approvals, making it impossible to correct construction errors in time.

The water conservancy bureaus of various provinces also made relatively profound self-criticisms, expressing their intention to apply the experiences and lessons learned from the spring repair to future construction and flood control.

### 东北召开水利会议检讨春修布置防汛

　　东北召开水利会议检讨春修布置防汛
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北水利总局于本月三日到九日召开了第三届水利会议，出席有东辽河水利局、各省水利局、盘山农场、沈阳市郊办事处、铁道部东北区特派员办事处、内蒙西辽河水利局等十一个单位。会上贯穿了批评和自我批评精神，总结与检查了上半年水利工程施工等问题，并具体讨论布置了夏季防汛工作。
    在上半年各地施工中，主要缺点是重量不重质，虽然在工程数量上已超过任务，质量也有进步，但质量距规定标准仍相差很远。因在工程设计与计划上存在许多缺点与错误，不仅浪费了国家巨大资金，也直接造成了工程质量不高。如在筑堤工程中有些断面不足，填土太松，不足防洪，六月份辽阳北沙河决口就是一例。在灌溉工程中，建筑物施工草率，混凝土不能达到预定安全程度。填土未夯实，容易塌陷。在治水工程上有些堤线设计不合理，有的忽宽忽窄，有的弯度过锐，妨碍洪水宣泄。辽东省营口农场水利工程计划变更三、四次，开工前两天才确定，以致经理工作很难配合。
    对这些工程，水利总局魏兆麟局长在总结中，代表总局做了自我检讨：主要是计划不周，没有抓紧工程计划这一主要环节，未根据具体情况提出可能实现的计划程序。同时，在今年一月的水利会议上所提的水利建设方针亦不够明确，未指明在什么情况下做什么建筑，因而各地在治河上不管大河小河、上游下游，“逢河就修堤”“逢湾就栽”，增加了排内水及护堤的困难。其次总局在技术指导方面也不及时。在春修中将大批技术干部全部分布到几个主要工程地区帮助施工，对其他地区送来请求审核的工程，因缺技术人员实地视察就难及时肯定的批答，使施工错误不能及时纠正。
    各省水利局也都做了比较深刻的检讨，表示要将春修中的经验教训用于今后施工与防汛上。
