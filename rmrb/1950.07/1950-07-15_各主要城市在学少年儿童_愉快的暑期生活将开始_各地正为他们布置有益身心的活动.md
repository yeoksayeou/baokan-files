Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Elementary and junior high school children in major cities across the country are about to begin their happy and meaningful summer vacation. Youth League organizations and relevant departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenyang, Jilin, Xi'an, Jinan, and other places are organizing or planning to organize various summer activities beneficial to the physical and mental development of children.

The most common organizational form of these activities is the children's park. Beijing has decided to establish sixteen children's parks throughout the city, equipped with libraries, game rooms, and playgrounds, and regularly hold activities such as singing, dancing, ball games, chess, fine arts, handicrafts, and wood carving. Jinan City is also preparing to organize ten children's parks in different districts, organizing children to visit, travel, collect, make specimens, build models, and listen to the radio. Jilin City will establish children's parks in all districts. Xi'an, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Yantai, Jining, Weifang, Xin Hailian and other cities will also organize children's parks with emphasis. Cities such as Shenyang and Shanghai, and some cities in provinces such as Pingyuan and Jiangxi, plan to conduct similar activities through the "Team Day" and "Team Meeting" of the Young Pioneers, and the "Return to School Day" and "Summer Day" of general primary school students.

In addition, various periodic and non-periodic children's get-togethers, achievement exhibitions, children's performances, story-telling sessions, recitations, meetings with heroes, and film screenings are also planned in various places. The children of Nanjing will have a get-together with the troops on August 1st Army Day and meet with combat heroes. Shanghai plans to screen children's films and exhibit photos of Soviet children's lives in rotation.

Some places will hold children's camps. Beijing will organize ten batches of children's camping in succession. Shenyang will also organize children's camping by school units where possible.

In order to help children review their lessons during the holidays, various places also plan to hold appropriate learning activities. Shenyang plans to organize children to participate in various tutoring groups based on the principle of voluntariness. Shanghai is also preparing to use the radio to tutor children in their lessons.

Without hindering the health of children, various places also plan to organize children to appropriately participate in some social service work, such as acting as "little teachers," publicizing the peace signature campaign, and mobilizing children to help their parents with some light labor.

    愉快的暑期生活将开始
    各地正为他们布置有益身心的活动
    【新华社十三日讯】全国各主要城市的小学和初中的少年儿童，即将开始他们愉快而有意义的暑期生活。北京、上海、南京、沈阳、吉林、西安、济南等地青年团组织和有关部门都正在举办或计划举办各种各样有益少年儿童身心发展的暑期活动。
    活动的组织形式，以儿童乐园为最普遍。北京市决定在全市设立十六个儿童乐园，园内设图书室、游艺室、游戏场，经常举行歌咏、舞蹈、球类、棋类、美术、手工、木刻等活动。济南市也准备分区举办十处少年儿童乐园，组织儿童参观、旅行、采集、标本、制造模型及收听广播。吉林市将在各区普遍设立儿童乐园。西安、青岛、徐州、烟台、济宁、潍坊、新海连等市亦将有重点地举办儿童乐园。沈阳、上海等城市和平原、江西等省的某些城市，计划通过少年儿童队的“队日”、“队会”，一般小学生的“返校日”、“夏令日”等方式，进行类似的活动。
    此外，各地还计划举办各种定期和不定期的儿童联欢会、成绩展览会、儿童演出会、故事会、朗诵会、和英雄见面会、电影轮回放映等活动。南京市少年儿童将在八一建军节与部队联欢，和战斗英雄见面。上海市计划轮回放映儿童影片和展览苏联儿童生活照片。
    有些地方将举办少年儿童营。北京市将先后组织十批少年儿童露营。沈阳亦将在可能条件下以学校为单位组织少年儿童露营。
    为了帮助少年儿童在假期中复习功课，各地还计划举办适当的学习活动。沈阳市计划根据自愿原则，组织儿童参加各种补习小组。上海市也准备利用广播电台，为少年儿童补习功课。
    在不妨碍少年儿童健康的原则下，各地还计划组织儿童适当地参加一些社会服务工作，如做小先生，宣传和平签名运动，并发动儿童帮助家长做一些轻便劳动等。
