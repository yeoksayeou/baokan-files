Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 16th:  Army Lieutenant Malatt of the 34th Regiment of the 24th Division of the United States Army, who was captured by the Korean People's Army, issued a letter to American compatriots on the 14th at the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, stating: I am one of the 114 American prisoners of war captured in Korea. Since our capture, we have been treated humanely, and our wounded are now receiving medical treatment in Korean hospitals.

When the United States government sent us to Korea, it explained to us that we were going to help the so-called peace-loving South Korea, defend their "Republic of Korea," and restore peace and order. When we arrived in Korea, it became clear that most of the Korean people were not committed to defending the South Korean government. South Korean troops fled by the thousands. South Korean citizens have openly expressed their desire to establish a unified state with the North Korean people.

Korea was a country subjected to foreign interference and enslavement long before World War II. The Korean people spent thirty-five years under the yoke of Japan. The people of North and South Korea have an overwhelming desire to unify and establish an independent country of their own choosing. After thirty-five years under Japanese shackles, both North and South Koreans are single-mindedly hoping to unify the country and form an independent state according to their own choices. The desires of these people are so strong that they will fight to the end to achieve them.

In view of the obvious desire of the Korean people, we prisoners of war feel that the Korean people should be allowed to end their own civil war and decide their own internal affairs.

Had there been no American intervention, they should have already ended this civil war. American intervention in this undeclared war has caused immense destruction of life and property. Thousands of Korean men, women, and children have been left homeless as a result. The attacks by the United States Air Force have caused enormous property damage. Countless Americans have lost their lives.

We believe that further intervention in this civil war will only cause greater waste of human life and property, and, apart from the certain need to spend huge sums to maintain a sufficiently strong army to rule an unsubmissive people, it will not achieve anything more. This will only strengthen the Korean people's hatred of the United States, and they will undoubtedly achieve their national unification. More Americans have been captured, and they will join us in a few days. As long as the air raids stop and the American troops withdraw from Korean territory, we American prisoners of war will be able to go home.

American compatriots, do not shoot and bomb the Korean people anymore; they have never done anything wrong to the United States. Leave Korea immediately. This is Army Lieutenant Malatt speaking to you.

### 让朝鲜人民自己结束国内战争  美军应即撤离朝鲜  朝鲜美战俘发表告美国同胞书

　　让朝鲜人民自己结束国内战争
    美军应即撤离朝鲜
    朝鲜美战俘发表告美国同胞书
    【新华社平壤十六日电】被朝鲜人民军俘虏的美国第二十四师第三十四团陆军中尉马拉特于十四日在朝鲜中央广播电台发表告美国同胞书称：我是在朝鲜被俘的一百一十四名美国战俘之一。自我们被俘以后，一直受到人道的待遇，我们的受伤者现在正在朝鲜医院里就医。
    美国政府派我们到朝鲜来时，曾向我们解释说，我们是去援助所谓爱好和平的南朝鲜，保卫他们的“大韩民国”和恢复和平及秩序。等到我们到朝鲜后，很明显地看出来，大多数朝鲜人民都不致力于保卫南朝鲜政府。南朝鲜的军队成千成千地逃走。南朝鲜的公民已公开表示他们希望与北朝鲜人民建立一个统一的国家。
    朝鲜在二次世界大战以前很久，便是一个遭受外国干涉和奴役的国家。朝鲜人民在日本的桎梏下度过了三十五年。北朝鲜与南朝鲜的人民有一个压倒一切的愿望，他们希望统一，希望建立一个他们自己所选择的独立国家。朝鲜人民在日本人的枷锁下过了三十五年，无论北部或是南部的朝鲜人都一心愿望统一全国，并随他们自己的选择组成一个独立的国家。这些人民的愿望是如此强烈，他们是会为其实现而战斗到最后的。
    鉴于朝鲜人民这种明显的愿望，我们战俘觉得，应该让朝鲜人民结束他们自己的内战，并决定他们自己的内部问题。
    假如没有美国的干涉，他们应该已经结束这次内战了。美国干涉在这次不宣而战的战争中，造成了生命和财产的巨大毁灭。成千的朝鲜男女和儿童因此无家可归。美国空军的袭击造成了巨大的财产损失。不知其数的美国人丧失了生命。
    我们认为，更进一步干涉这次内战只会造成人类生命和财产的更大浪费，而且，除了确定不疑地须化费巨额费用来维持一支足够强大的军队，以统治不屈服的人民之外，不会更有什么结果。这只会加强朝鲜人民对美国的憎恨，而他们无疑地是会取得他们的民族统一的。已有更多的美国人被俘获了，他们在几天之后就会和我们汇合在一起了。只要空袭停止，美国军队撤离朝鲜领土，我们美国战俘就能够回家。
    美国同胞们，不要再射击和轰炸朝鲜人，他们对美国从来不曾作过不正当的事情。立即离开朝鲜吧。这是陆军中尉马拉特在向你们讲话。
