    Oppose Superficial and Isolated Rectification
    Northeast Bureau Propaganda Department Deploys Rectification
    The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged department meeting on July 6 to deploy rectification. Minister Li Zhuoran pointed out that rectification must be combined with the review and summary of the department's work in the past six months, especially the second quarter, to oppose superficial and isolated rectification and avoid the formalism of perfunctory self-reflection. He also pointed out that it is necessary to ensure from the leadership that there is a full principled atmosphere and democratic style in ideological deliberation and work review. We must also be good at guiding everyone to specifically study the main problems in the work, analyze the reasons for their occurrence, and find ways to improve them. According to the spirit of Minister Li Zhuoran's instructions, the propaganda and cultural departments at the Northeast level officially began rectification study on "July 7th".

    反对泛泛地与孤立地整
    东北局宣传部布置整风
    中共中央东北局宣传部于七月六日召开扩大部务会议，布置整风。李卓然部长指出整风必须与检查和总结本部门近半年来的工作，特别是第二季度的工作结合起来进行，反对泛泛地整与孤立地整，避免照例反省一番的形式主义偏向。同时指出必须从领导上保证在思想酝酿及工作检讨中要有充分的原则空气和民主作风。并善于引导大家具体研究工作中的主要毛病，分析其产生的原因并找出改进办法。东北一级的宣传文教部门根据李卓然部长的指示精神，已于“七七”起正式开始整风学习。
