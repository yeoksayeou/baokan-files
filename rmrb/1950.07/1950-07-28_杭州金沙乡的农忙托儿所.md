　　The Farm-Busy Season Nursery in Jinsha Township, Hangzhou
　　The main sources of livelihood for residents of Jinsha Township in Hangzhou's West Lake District are farming and tea picking. This spring, a Qingshiqiao Primary School was opened in the township. When the tea-picking season arrived in April, the older children all went home to pick tea, and the school was unable to hold classes. In order to alleviate the suffering of local farm women who were burdened by their children during the busy farming season, and to take care of the primary school students so that they would not waste their studies, the school's faculty and staff decided after discussion to use the school site to run a farm-busy season nursery.
　　Running a nursery in the countryside is fraught with difficulties: no equipment, no experience, farm women are not accustomed to entrusting their children to nurseries, and there are no sufficient funds. The total start-up cost of this nursery was only fifty "real units" allocated by the Education Bureau and three dou of rice donated by the principal and teachers (which they used to buy flour, white sugar, soybeans, firewood, mats, soap, etc. for infants). They mobilized all the staff of the school and used all possible existing equipment to meet the needs of the nursery: the principal and teachers moved to the attic, vacated their bedrooms as infant rooms, and gave their beds for the infants to nap; and they pieced together desks and laid boards on them for the older children to nap. The only classroom was used as a children's activity room, and the bookshelves were converted into bowl and dish cabinets. The teachers became health workers and teachers. The school's female workers became the children's nannies. They also consulted with the West Lake Health Office, which provided medicines and assisted in treatment work. Thanks to their unremitting efforts, and with the assistance of the government and the local people, the nursery was established on April 17.
　　When the nursery was first established, farm women were worried about entrusting their children to the nursery. Some were afraid that it would cost money and they would not be able to afford it; others said, "If we send our children to the nursery, they might become public property." The principal and teachers used all possible methods, such as holding mothers' forums, conducting home visits, publicizing through students in the school to their parents, and publicizing through agricultural association group leaders to their members, repeatedly explaining to the masses that the purpose of running the nursery was to help mothers get rid of the burden of their children so that they could work and produce well; they could take them back whenever they wanted, and it was free. In this way, the concerns of the masses were dispelled. The number of children admitted to the nursery gradually increased to forty-nine. The mothers of these children were all directly involved in production (this was the principle of the nursery for admitting children), and the families of these children were mostly poor and hired farm laborers, and there were also revolutionary military dependents, middle peasants, workers, and freelancers.
　　The children in the nursery are divided into infant class (nursing), small class (three to four years old) and large class (five to ten years old). The farm women bring their children in the morning and pick them up in the evening. Every day after the children arrive, the five staff members of the nursery carry out cleaning and nursing work for the children (such as washing their faces, washing their hands, and taking their temperature). Every day at nine o'clock in the morning, the nursery provides them with a free serving of soy milk (the mothers take turns grinding the soybeans), and regularly feeds the infants rice flour cakes. At noon, the children in the large and small classes bring their own food to eat, and the infants are breastfed by their mothers once.
　　The work of rural nurseries is more difficult than that of urban nurseries. There are dung tanks and ditches everywhere near the houses, so the caregivers have to be especially careful. There are no toys, and there is a lack of educational tools, so the children get bored and run home in groups. The teachers have to use all kinds of waste materials to make toys for the children; use the scenery of nature to educate the children, such as letting the children recognize flowers, grass, trees, and so on; and personally lead the children in playing games. In this way, the children gradually develop a liking for the nursery and become accustomed to collective life day by day. After a month and a half of care, the children's health has also improved, diseases have generally decreased, and they have developed habits of cleanliness and love of labor. The nursery not only helped mothers solve the difficulties during the busy farming season, but also taught them many hygienic common sense about taking care of children.
　　At present, the first phase has ended. The masses now realize that running a nursery is a good thing. They have requested to continue the second phase (which began in June), and some are willing to pay a portion of the fees. The masses are preparing to reclaim wasteland on their own, and use the production income as the permanent fund of the nursery, in order to lay the foundation for a privately run nursery.

### 杭州金沙乡的农忙托儿所

　　杭州金沙乡的农忙托儿所
    杭州西湖区金沙乡居民主要的生活来源是耕种和采茶。今年春天，该乡开办了一个青石桥小学。当四月采茶季节，较大的孩子都回家采茶去了，学校便无法上课。学校的教职员们为了减轻当地农妇们在农忙季节被孩子牵累的痛苦，并照顾在校的小学生不荒废学业，经过商讨之后，决定利有该校校址办一个农忙托儿所。
    在农村办托儿所是困难重重的：没有设备，没有经验，农妇们没有寄托孩子的习惯，更没有足够的经费。这个托儿所全部开办费只有教育局拨发的五十个折实单位和由校长教员发动捐来的三斗米（他们用来买了供婴儿食用的面粉、白糖、黄豆、柴、席子、肥皂等物）。她们动员了学校全体工作人员，利用一切可能利用的现有设备，以适应托儿所的需要：校长、教师都搬到阁楼上，将卧室腾出作为婴儿室，将床给婴儿午睡；并把课桌拚起来搭上板子，给大些的孩子午睡。又将仅有的一间课堂作为孩子们的活动室，把书架改装为碗菜橱。教师成了保健员兼教员。学校的女工成了孩子们的褓姆。她们又和西湖卫生事务所商妥，由他们供给药品及协助治疗工作。由于她们不懈的努力，在政府和当地人民的协助下，托儿所在四月十七日成立了。
    托儿所刚成立时，农妇们不放心将孩子交给托儿所。有的怕要钱，缴不起；有的说：“把孩子送到托儿所去说不定就变成公家的人了。”校长、教师们用了各种可能的办法，如召开母亲座谈会，进行家庭访问，通过在校小朋友向家长宣传，通过农协小组长在会员中进行宣传等，反复向群众说明：办托儿所是为了帮助母亲们解除孩子的牵累，好好干活、生产；什么时候想抱回去都可以，而且不要钱。这样，群众的顾虑才解除了。入所的儿童逐渐增加到四十九人。这些孩子的母亲都是直接参加生产的（这是所里吸收儿童的原则），这些孩子的家庭绝大多数是贫、雇农成份，其中也有革命军人家属、中农、工人和自由职业者。
    所里儿童分为婴儿班（哺乳的）、小班（三岁至四岁）和大班（五岁至十岁）。农妇们每天早上把孩子送来，傍晚接回去。每天孩子们来了以后，所里的五位工作人员即为孩子们进行清洁、护理工作（如洗脸、洗手、量体温等）。每天上午九点钟所方免费供给他们一顿豆浆（母亲们轮流来磨），并按时给婴儿喂米粉糕。中午大、小班的孩子自己带饭来吃，婴儿则由母亲来喂一次奶。
    农村托儿所的工作是比城市困难的。房子附近到处都是粪缸、水沟，这就要保育人员特别当心。没有玩具，更缺少教育用具，孩子们压倦了就大群地跑回家去。教师们就得利用各种废物为孩子们制造玩具；利用大自然的景物给孩子们进行教育，譬如让孩子们认识花、草、树、木等；并亲自带着孩子们做游戏。这样终于使孩子们逐渐对托儿所发生好感，一天天习惯了集体生活。经过一个半月的保育，孩子们的健康也有了进步，疾病普遍减少，并养成了爱清洁、爱劳动的习惯。托儿所不但帮助母亲们解决了农忙时的困难，而且还教给她们许多带孩子的卫生常识。
    目前，第一期已经结束。群众现在已认识到办托儿所是件好事。他们要求续办第二期（已于六月开始），有的并愿意缴一部分费用。群众并准备自己开荒，将生产所得，作为托儿所的永久基金，以打下民办托儿所的基础。
