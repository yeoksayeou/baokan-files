　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th—Since the beginning of March to mid-May, the People's Liberation Army Shaanxi Military Region and a certain army corps have reclaimed 562,600 mu of wasteland, successfully completing the first-quarter production plan. Some units even exceeded their original plans. In terms of road construction, approximately one million cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed. In addition, significant achievements have been made in various industrial and sideline productions. However, during the production process, due to the lack of experience of leading cadres in leading large-scale military production, the following deviations occurred: (1) Widespread neglect of organizational leadership and technical guidance in production, resulting in a huge waste of labor; (2) Some units blindly engaged in industrial operations without planning for the supply and marketing of raw materials and products, resulting in losses in most cases; (3) Some units' production was divorced from learning and bandit suppression work. The above issues have been studied and reviewed at an enlarged meeting of the Army Corps and Military Region Party Committee. The meeting pointed out that the main task of the army is to defend the motherland and should not affect the important task of building a national defense force due to participation in production. A democratic work style should be implemented throughout the production leadership, opposing empiricism, and leveraging the labor enthusiasm and wisdom of all commanders and fighters to further improve production efficiency. In agriculture, intensive farming should be promoted, striving to "plant well, hoe well, harvest well, and store well." When reclaiming wasteland on mountain slopes, attention should be paid to preventing mountain floods. In the industrial sector, efforts should be concentrated on running one or two larger-scale modern factories in the future; before starting factories, each unit should first prepare plans and submit them to the Army Corps and Military Region Production Committee for review to avoid blind operations. The factories that have already been established should now study their development prospects and operating conditions to decide whether to gradually expand production or reduce/close them down. Regarding the issue of production dividends, it should be handled in accordance with the principle of considering both public and private interests in the instructions issued by Chairman Mao on the army's participation in production and construction. Under the correct grasp of the principles that production increases national wealth, reduces the people's burden, takes care of the physical strength of producers, and pays attention to improving the quality of products, it is advocated to produce more and distribute more dividends.

　　陕西军区暨某兵团部队
    开荒五十六万余亩
    生产中发生几点偏向已经注意纠正
    【新华社西安二十八日电】人民解放军陕西军区和某兵团部队自三月初开始至五月中旬，已开荒五十六万二千六百余亩，胜利完成首季生产计划，有的部队且超过了原订计划。在修路方面，现已完成约一百万立方公尺的土石方工程。此外在各种工业生产及副业生产方面也都有显著成绩。但在生产中，由于领导干部对领导部队进行大规模生产的经验不足，因而也产生了下述各种偏向：（一）在生产中普遍忽视组织领导和技术指导，结果造成劳动力的巨大浪费；（二）有些单位盲目经营工业，没有计划原料和产品的供销，因而大多赔钱；（三）有的单位生产与学习和剿匪工作脱节。上述问题，已在兵团暨军区党委扩大会议上进行了研究、检讨。会议指出：军队的主要任务是捍卫祖国，不能因参加生产而影响建设国防军的重大任务。在整个生产领导中要贯彻民主作风，反对经验主义，发挥全体指战员的劳动热情和智慧，把生产效率提高一步。农业方面要提倡精耕细作，争取作到“种好、锄好、收好、存好”。在山坡上开荒时注意预防山洪水灾。工业方面今后要集中力量办好一两个规模较大的现代化工厂；各单位开办工厂要首先把计划作好，送到兵团和军区生产委员会审核，避免盲目经营。已开办的工厂，现在即要研究其发展前途及经营情况，以决定逐步扩大生产或缩小、停办。关于生产分红问题，根据毛主席颁发的军队参加生产建设工作的指示中公私兼顾的方针处理。在正确掌握生产是增加国家财富减轻人民负担并照顾生产者的体力和注意提高生产品的质量的原则下，提倡多生产多分红。
