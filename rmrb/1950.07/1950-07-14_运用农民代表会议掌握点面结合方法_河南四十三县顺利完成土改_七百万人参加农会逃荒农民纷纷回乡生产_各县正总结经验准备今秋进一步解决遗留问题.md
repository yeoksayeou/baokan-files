Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, July 12th: In Henan Province, rural areas in 43 counties (out of 86 counties in the province), accounting for half the province, have completed land reform this spring. The population in these areas is approximately 16.89 million, accounting for over 50% of the province's 30 million population. Land reform in the remaining half of Henan will be carried out after this autumn.

In the past two years, especially last year, Henan's rural areas launched a series of rural social reform movements, including suppressing bandits, opposing local despots, and reducing rent. Through these peasant movements, banditry in Henan was basically eliminated, the economic power of the landlord class was partially weakened, and its feudal rule in politics was basically crushed. The peasants' awareness gradually increased during the struggles, and they organized into powerful peasant forces – the Farmers' Associations – establishing their initial dominance in the countryside. The peasants' demand for land reform grew stronger day by day. To this end, the Henan Provincial People's Government formulated the "Henan Province Land Reform Regulations" in accordance with the Common Program, and after submitting it to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council for approval, it was promulgated and implemented in February this year. The Provincial People's Government and the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the strength of the cadres and the foundation of rural work, decided to first implement land reform in half of the areas and strive to complete it before the wheat harvest. Subsequently, a large-scale, well-led, step-by-step, and orderly land reform movement unfolded in the rural areas of half of Henan.

Prior to this, in the autumn of last year, Henan had already conducted typical experiments on land reform in well-performing villages in seven counties, including Baofeng in Xuchang Prefecture. Immediately afterwards, land reform was fully implemented in the seven counties, (these seven counties were liberated earlier, had a better foundation for rural work, and were advanced areas of the peasant movement in Henan). The decision on the 36 counties to complete land reform by the wheat harvest was also based on the degree of mobilization and organization of the peasant masses and the preparation of cadre strength. The other 43 counties, because they did not yet have the conditions for implementing land reform, continued to carry out preparatory work for land reform this spring, such as opposing local despots and reducing rent, transforming rural people's governments, and consolidating the organization of Farmers' Associations.

At the beginning of the large-scale land reform movement this spring, all localities earnestly carried out policy propaganda, mainly the propaganda of the Henan Province Land Reform Regulations. All localities also convened people's representative conferences, farmers' representative conferences, and special conferences of various strata. Through these conferences and various forms of propaganda, people from all walks of life, mainly peasants, understood all the policies of the People's Government related to land reform; enabling them to master the policies and supervise the cadres' implementation during the movement, and making the landlords understand that they must abide by the law, otherwise they would be punished by the People's Government. After understanding the policies, the peasants generally said: "We know what to do, and we must act according to the policies in the future." At the same time, leading organs at all levels conducted cadre training in a planned way. Most of the cadres participating in land reform at all levels went through party consolidation meetings, cadre meetings, or land reform training classes, summarizing and reviewing past work. Through these studies and reviews, cadres at all levels criticized empiricism and other incorrect ideas, studied land reform policies, and learned to use new leadership methods for various representative conferences.

Land reform in the seven counties, including Baofeng, was completed successively in February this year. Land reform in the other 36 counties, some like Chenliu and Luoyang counties, unfolded in February and March, while most areas fully unfolded in April and were largely completed by the wheat harvest. Land reform movements in various localities generally went through the following steps: 1. Propagating land reform policies; 2. Consolidating peasant ranks; 3. Classifying classes; 4. According to the "Henan Province Land Reform Regulations" approved by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, confiscating landlords' land, draught animals, farm tools, houses (in rural areas), and surplus grain, requisitioning rich peasants' land and production materials such as draught animals and farm tools exceeding the level of local average middle peasants, as well as temple lands and public properties, etc.; 5. Peasants distributing confiscated and requisitioned land and means of production, and allotting a share to landlords according to the law.

In the land reform movement, all localities universally applied the mass line of promoting the land reform movement with farmers' representative conferences; generally mastering the method of focusing on key points for mobilization, gradually promoting from key points and combining key points with the overall situation. In this way, the land reform movement progressed smoothly and rapidly. At the same time, due to in-depth policy propaganda and the preparation of cadres' thinking, the correct implementation of policies throughout the entire process of land reform was guaranteed, maintaining good order in the land reform movement. Peasants in the land reform movement were able to grasp the policies. Under the supervision of the peasants, the landlord class could generally abide by the laws of the People's Government. Those few lawless landlords who spread rumors and sabotaged land reform were exposed by the peasant masses; those who resisted the implementation of laws, the peasants waged reasoned struggles against them. A very small number of landlords who sabotaged land reform and committed serious crimes were punished by the people's court according to law. In the land reform movement, all localities resolutely implemented the policy of uniting with middle peasants and protecting industry and commerce. In the past, individual areas had encroached on the interests of middle peasants or industry and commerce during the anti-local despot or rent reduction movements, and appropriate compensation was made during this land distribution.

In the 43 counties of Henan Province that have completed land reform, the feudal land ownership system has been completely eliminated, and the peasants have become the true masters of the countryside. Through the tempering of land reform struggles, they have further expanded and consolidated their organizations. The number of Farmers' Association members in the province has increased from 4 million before land reform to 7,137,000, of which the number of women members has increased from 1,080,000 to 2,450,000. 257,500 young and middle-aged peasants voluntarily joined the militia. In these areas, many villages have established branches of the Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League. The peasants who have been allocated land are very enthusiastic about production. Many peasants who had been fleeing famine for many years returned to their hometowns and received land during the land reform. In six counties, including Wuyang in Xuchang Prefecture, more than 40,000 peasants returned home to receive land.

In areas where land reform was implemented in Henan this spring, about 30% of the areas were rushed due to the approaching wheat harvest, and the work was relatively rough. This is mainly reflected in: the classification of classes was not meticulous enough, individual middle peasants were classified as rich peasants, and some individual rich peasants were classified as landlords; the distribution of land and means of production was also relatively rough. The bureaucratic style (such as lack of investigation and research before the movement), formalism (such as mechanically handling affairs according to certain forms and procedures regardless of the masses' awareness), and commandism (such as acting as a substitute and forcing others to do things) still manifested by some land reform cadres in their work are the main reasons for the rough work. The counties in Henan that have completed land reform have begun to summarize their experiences and prepare to further resolve the remaining issues in land reform work after the autumn harvest this year, correct the shortcomings in this spring's work, so as to satisfactorily conclude the land reform in these areas.

　　运用农民代表会议掌握点面结合方法
    河南四十三县顺利完成土改
    七百万人参加农会逃荒农民纷纷回乡生产
    各县正总结经验准备今秋进一步解决遗留问题
    【新华社开封十二日电】河南省已经有一半地区四十三个县（全省八十六县）的农村，在今春完成了土地改革。这些地区人口约为一千六百八十九万，占全省三千万人口的百分之五十以上。河南其余一半地区的土地改革，将在今年秋后进行。
    河南省农村在去前两年，主要是去年，曾经开展过剿匪、反对恶霸和减租等一系列的农村社会改革运动。经过这些农民运动，河南匪患基本上已告肃清，地主阶级在经济上已有部分削弱，政治上的封建统治也被基本上摧垮了。农民在历次斗争中觉悟日渐提高，并组织成强大的农民队伍——农民协会，初步树立起在农村中的优势。农民要求土地改革的呼声随之日益高涨。为此，河南省人民政府即根据共同纲领的规定，制订“河南省土地改革条例”，经呈请中央人民政府政务院批准后，于今年二月颁布实施。省人民政府和中共河南省委员会，根据干部力量和农村工作基础，决定首先在一半地区实行土地改革，争取在麦收前完成。接着，一个大规模的有领导、有步骤、有秩序的土地改革运动，就在河南一半地区的农村中展开了。
    在此以前，河南于去年秋后，即已在许昌专区宝丰等七个县选择工作较好的乡村进行了土地改革的典型实验；随即又在宝丰等七县（这七个县解放较早，农村工作基础较好，是河南农民运动的先进地区）全面实行了土地改革。决定在麦收完成土地改革的三十六个县，也是根据农民群众发动和组织的程度，以及干部力量准备来决定的。另四十三县，即因尚未具备实行土地改革的条件，今春仍继续进行了反对恶霸与减租、改造乡村人民政权和整顿农民协会的组织等土地改革的准备工作。
    今春大规模的土地改革运动开始时，各地都认真地进行过政策宣传，主要是对河南省土地改革条例的宣传。各地又都召开过各界人民代表会议、农民代表会议，以及各阶层的专门会议。通过这些会议和各种形式的宣传，各阶层人民，主要是农民，都了解了人民政府一切有关土地改革的政策；使他们在运动中能够掌握政策并能监督干部执行，使地主们明白必须遵守法令，否则就要受到人民政府的惩处。农民在明了了政策以后，普遍说：“咱们心里有数了，今后一定要照着政策办事。”同时，各级领导机关都有计划地进行了干部训练。各级参加土地改革工作的干部大都经过了整党会议、干部会议或土地改革训练班的学习，总结和检查过去的工作。经过这些学习和检查，各级干部批判了经验主义及其他不正确的思想，并研究了土地改革的政策，学会了运用各种代表会议的新的领导方法。
    宝丰等七县的土地改革在今年二月即先后完成，其他三十六县的土地改革，一部如陈留、洛阳等县在二、三月次第展开，大部地区在四月间即全面展开，麦收时即已大体全部完成。各地土地改革运动中大体上都经过以下几个步骤：一、宣传土地改革政策；二、整顿农民队伍；三、划分阶级；四、按中央人民政府政务院所批准的“河南省土地改革条例”，没收地主土地、耕畜、农具、房屋（农村中的）和多余的粮食，征收富农超出当地一般中农水平的土地和耕畜、农具等生产资料以及庙地公产等；五、农民分配没收和征收的土地和生产资料，并按法令给地主分一份。
    在土地改革运动中各地普遍运用了以农民代表会议推动土地改革运动的群众路线；一般地掌握了重点发动、逐渐由点推广及面的点面结合的方法。这样，土地改革运动进展顺利而迅速。同时，由于深入宣传政策，干部思想有准备，保证了土地改革的整个过程中政策的正确贯彻，保持了土地改革运动的良好秩序。土地改革运动中，农民均能掌握政策。地主阶级在农民的监督下，一般尚能遵守人民政府的法令。少数不法地主对土地改革进行造谣破坏者，均经农民群众揭发；抗拒执行法令的，农民就与之进行了说理的斗争。极少数的破坏土地改革、罪恶重大的地主，人民法庭就依法予以惩处。土地改革运动中各地都坚决贯彻了团结中农和保护工商业的政策。过去个别地区在反恶霸或减租运动中曾发生侵犯中农利益或侵犯工商业的，也都在这次分配土地时做了适当的补偿。
    完成了土地改革的河南省的四十三县农村，封建土地所有制已彻底消灭，农民成了农村中的真正主人。他们经过土地改革斗争的锻炼，进一步扩大和巩固了自己的组织。全省农民协会会员，已由土地改革以前的四百万人增加到现在的七百十三万七千人，其中妇女会员由一百零八万人增加到现在的二百四十五万人。二十五万七千五百名青年和壮年农民自动参加了民兵。在这些地区里，不少乡村已经建立了共产党和新民主主义青年团的支部组织。分得土地的农民，生产情绪很高。许多多年逃荒流浪在外的农民，在土地改革时都相率返里分得了土地。许昌专区舞阳等六个县，回家分地的农民就有四万多人。
    河南今春实行土地改革的地区中约百分之三十的地区因为麦收迫近，时间紧促，工作比较粗糙。这主要表现在：划分阶级不够细致，个别中农被划成了富农，也有个别富农被划成了地主；土地和生产资料的分配也较粗糙。部分土地改革工作干部在工作中所表现的仍然较严重的官僚主义（如运动前缺乏调查研究）、形式主义（如不问群众觉悟如何，机械地按一定的形式、一定的程序办事）、命令主义（包办代替、强迫硬逼）的不良作风，是工作粗糙的主要原因。现河南已完成土地改革的各县已开始总结经验，准备在今年秋收以后，进一步解决土地改革工作中的遗留问题，纠正今春工作中的缺点，以便圆满结束这些地区的土地改革。
