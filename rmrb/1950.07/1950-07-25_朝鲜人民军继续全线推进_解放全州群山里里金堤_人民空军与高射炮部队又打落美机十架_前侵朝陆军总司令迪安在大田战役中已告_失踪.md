Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th -- The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced on the morning of the 23rd: The People's Army units attacking towards Jeonju, after defeating the stubborn American troops, completely liberated Jeonju City, the capital of North Jeolla Province, on the evening of the 21st.

The People's Army Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units inflicted a huge blow on the American Air Force. On the 18th and 19th, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units fiercely fired on more than 30 American planes that invaded Wonsan and Hungnam, resulting in eight American planes being shot down. On the 20th, the People's Army Air Force units engaged in aerial combat with superior numbers of American Air Force formations over southern Daejeon, resulting in two American bombers being shot down.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th -- The Supreme Headquarters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a battle report on the evening of July 22nd stating: The units of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continue to advance on all fronts.

On the western front, the People's Army units continued to advance, liberating many counties, districts, and townships, including the large city of Gunsan in North Jeolla Province (Gunsan is a famous granary and trading port in Korea) and Iri. Another unit of the People's Army, pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy, liberated Gimje on the same day.

In the battles to liberate the above-mentioned cities, the People's Army units captured many officers and soldiers and seized countless war trophies. Detailed battle results are being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo: MacArthur confirmed in a report to the U.S. Department of the Army on the 22nd that Dean, the former commander of the U.S. Army invading Korea and commander of the 24th Division of the U.S. Eighth Army, had "gone missing" in the Battle of Daejeon. MacArthur said in his report: "I deeply regret to report that Major General Dean, commander of the 24th Division, is "missing" in action. An interpreter who was with General Dean said he was injured, but because the interpreter himself was very seriously injured, he could not say how serious Dean's injuries actually were."

According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 21st: The Korean People's Army "split the American forces" in Daejeon into two parts and surrounded one part. Dean was with the surrounded part. The U.S. military sent armored forces to rescue them, but failed to break through the encirclement. Because the rescue force itself was also in danger of being surrounded, it had to retreat. According to unofficial sources: "A regimental commander of the 24th Division, Aris, is also missing."

    前侵朝陆军总司令迪安在大田战役中已告“失踪”
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部二十三日晨公布：向全州方面进攻的人民军部队击溃了顽抗的美军后，已于二十一日晚完全解放了全罗北道的省会全州市。
    人民军空军与高射炮部队予美空军以巨大打击。十八、十九两日间，人民军高射炮部队对侵袭元山与兴南的美机三十余架猛烈射击，结果击落美机八架。二十日，人民军空军部队在大田南部上空与数量上占优势的美空军编队展开空战，结果击落美轰炸机两架。
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高统帅部七月二十二日晚间发表战报称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军各部队继续全线推进。
    在西线一方面，人民军部队继续前进，解放了许多县、区、乡，其中包括全罗北道的大城市群山（按群山是朝鲜著名的谷仓与商港）与里里。追歼逃敌的人民军另部同日解放了金堤。
    在解放上述各城的战斗中，人民军各部俘掳了许多官兵，缴获战利品无数，详细战果正在清查中。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据法新社东京讯：麦克阿瑟在二十二日给美国陆军部的报告中证实：曾任美国侵略朝鲜的美陆军总司令、美第八军第二十四师师长迪安，已于大田战役中“失踪”。麦克阿瑟在他的报告中说：“我深深遗憾地报告：第二十四师师长迪安少将在战斗中“失踪”。曾和迪安将军在一起的翻译员说他受了伤，但由于翻译员自己受伤非常严重，他不能说出迪安的伤势究竟严重到什么程度。”
    又据法新社二十一日讯：朝鲜人民军把在大田的“美国部队劈成两部分，并包围其一部分，迪安就和被包围的一部分在一起。美军曾派装甲部队前往援救，但未能突破重围。由于援救部队本身也有被包围的危险，所以不得不撤退。据非官方消息：第二十四师的一位团长阿里斯亦已失踪。”
