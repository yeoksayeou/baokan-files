Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—The Indian government, which has consistently touted a policy of "neutrality," has revealed its true attitude on the Korean issue this time. On June 25th, when the United Nations Security Council convened to illegally vote on the US representative's proposal to interfere in the Korean civil war, the Indian representative voted in favor. On June 27th, when the Security Council illegally voted on the US representative's proposal to conduct armed intervention in the Korean civil war, the Indian representative suddenly abstained. However, Indian President Nehru then telegraphed UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 29th, expressing his support for the Security Council's second illegal resolution. In a note to the United Nations, the Indian government stated that it "accepts the Security Council's second resolution," while also saying: "The Indian government's decision does not involve any change in its foreign policy," and India's policy "remains an independent policy." But the Indian Ambassador to the United States, Mrs. Pandit, said frankly that she was "distressed" by the criticism from all sides in the United States about India's abstention, saying: "The word neutrality does not exist in my vocabulary."

The Indian government's actions have been praised by US officials. According to Agence France-Presse: Washington "received the New Delhi government's decision with great enthusiasm" because "India has clearly abandoned the goal of fighting for Asian independence."

According to an Agence France-Presse reporter: Some political figures in New Delhi were "quite surprised" by the Indian government's attitude because "since it has clearly sided with the United States in supporting the Security Council's decision, it still wants to maintain a neutral appearance."

This policy of the Indian government has been met with fierce criticism. Indian Member of Parliament Saxena said: The Indian government's policy is bound to drag India "into a meaningless war vortex for the benefit of reactionaries." At the same time, Mr. Kal, chairman of the Hindu Mahasabha, also pointed out that the attitude adopted by the Indian government on the Korean issue this time is "disguised neutrality."

　　印伪装中立充当美帝帮凶  对朝鲜问题真实态度暴露
    安理会印代表竟投票赞成美干涉朝鲜
    【新华社七日讯】一向标榜“中立”政策的印度政府，此次在朝鲜问题上表明了它的真实态度。六月二十五日联合国安理会开会非法表决美国代表所提干涉朝鲜内战的议案时，印度代表投了赞成票。六月二十七日，安理会非法表决美国代表所提对朝鲜内战进行武装干涉的议案时，印度代表忽又弃权。但印度总统尼赫鲁随即于二十九日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，表示赞同安理会的第二个非法决议。印度政府在致联合国的照会中，一面表示“接受安理会的第二个决议”，一面却又说：“印度政府的决定并不牵涉其外交政策的任何改变”，印度的政策“仍为一个独立的政策”。但印度驻美大使潘迪特夫人则率直地说：她对美国各方批评印度弃权的行动“表示痛心”，她说：“在我的字汇中并没有中立这个字”。
    印度政府的行动得到了美国官方的嘉许。据法新社称：华盛顿“以一种极大的热情接到新德里政府的决定”，因为“印度已明确放弃了为亚洲独立而奋斗的目标”。
    据法新社记者称：新德里某些政界人士对于印度政府的态度“颇表惊讶”，因为它“既然显已站在美国一边支持安理会决定以后，又想在外表上保持中立的样子”。
    印度政府的这一政策遭受到猛烈的打击。印度国会议员萨克森那说：印度政府的政策势必要把印度“卷入为反动派利益而进行的无意义的战争漩涡里”。同时，印度教大乘会主席卡尔也指出，印度政府此次在朝鲜问题上所采取的态度，乃是“伪装的中立”。
