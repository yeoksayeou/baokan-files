Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: TASS Moscow, 29th—*Pravda*'s Berlin correspondent Korolkov published an article in *Pravda* entitled "Documents Expose the Truth," writing: Before me is an exposing document: a photo taken in South Korea by an Associated Press reporter before the traitorous attack by the Syngman Rhee clique on the Korean people. In the foreground of the photo, the image of the warmonger John Foster Dulles, advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State, can be clearly seen. He is perusing maps of future operations on the parapet of a trench. One of the senior U.S. military officers is gazing into the distance. One of Dulles's entourage climbed out of the trench and carefully observed the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with binoculars. One can understand what was going on by looking at the photo. The American reporter's camera recorded the final stage of the imperialists' preparation to attack North Korea on the demarcation line. Accompanied by American officers and soldiers of the Syngman Rhee mercenary army, Dulles personally reviewed the South Korean army, which had already entered combat readiness.

Here is another document confirming the fact of the aggression against the Korean people. Five days before the provocation prepared in Korea by the Americans, a reporter from the Swiss newspaper *Neue Zürcher Zeitung* reported from the Far East: "From an economic point of view, South Korea has fallen into a difficult position. Profitable industrial enterprises and major power stations are almost entirely in North Korea. South Korea does not have enough large industrial enterprises. Therefore, it is impossible to provide work even for a small portion of the four million unemployed." The Syngman Rhee clique saw only one way out of the disastrous situation created by the American colonists: to seize North Korea and enslave all the Korean people. The *Neue Zürcher Zeitung* reporter frankly wrote: "Many people in South Korea believe that the solution to this difficult economic problem lies in a military attack on North Korea. The well-trained and American-equipped army of 100,000 men, as well as a police force of 50,000, are likely to greatly exceed the North Korean army."

Berlin's democratic newspapers published the photos and excerpts from the Swiss newspaper. Thus, American reporters and Swiss reporters exposed the instigating role of Wall Street merchants in the Korean incident.

　　“证件暴露了真相”
     真理报记者著文揭穿华尔街商人在朝鲜事件中挑拨作用
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：真理报驻柏林记者科罗尔科夫在真理报上发表题为《证件暴露了真相》的专文写道：在我的面前是一个暴露性的证件，这是美联社记者在李承晚集团背信弃义地攻击朝鲜人民以前，在南朝鲜所拍的照片。在照片的前部可以清楚地看到美国国务卿顾问战争贩子杜勒斯的像貌。他在战壕的雉堞上翻阅着未来作战的地图。美国的高级军官之一向着远方注视。杜勒斯的随行人员之一，爬出战壕，并以望远镜仔细观察朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领土。看到照片就可了解这是怎么一回事。美国记者的照相机在分界线上记录了帝国主义者准备攻击北朝鲜的最后阶段。在美国军官及李承晚雇佣军队的军人的随从之下，杜勒斯亲自检阅了已经进入作战准备的南朝鲜军队。
    此处还有另一文件证实侵略朝鲜人民的事实。在美国人在朝鲜准备的挑拨事件发生前五天，瑞士报纸《新苏黎世报》记者自远东报道说：“自经济观点看来，南朝鲜已陷于困难地位。产生利润的工业企业以及主要电力站几乎完全在北朝鲜，南朝鲜没有足够的大工业企业。因此，它甚至对四百万失业者中的一小部分也不可能供给工作。”李承晚集团对于美国殖民者所制造的灾难局势只看到一条出路——夺取北朝鲜和奴役全朝鲜人民。《新苏黎世报》记者坦白写道：“南朝鲜有许多人认为：这个困难的经济问题的解决，是在于军事攻击北朝鲜。训练有素的和美国人所配备的十万陆军，以及为数五万的警察部队，很可能大大地超过北朝鲜的陆军。”
    柏林的民主报纸刊载了瑞士报纸的照片及摘录。这样，美国记者和瑞士记者就暴露了华尔街商人在朝鲜事件中的挑拨作用。
