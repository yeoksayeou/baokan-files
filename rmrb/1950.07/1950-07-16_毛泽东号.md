　　“Mao Zedong Locomotive”
    Lugong

    "...Our railway workers had heroic figures like Lin Xiangqian in the past. In the recent years of the Liberation War, labor heroes like Comrade Li Yong of the 'Mao Zedong Locomotive' have emerged..."
    —Speech by Comrade Li Lisan at the National Congress of the Railway Workers' Union of China.

           I

    There was a broken locomotive,
    With broken legs and missing arms,
    Abandoned at Zhaodong Station,
    Subjected to wind and rain,
    No one paid attention to it,
    Like a dead horse.
    The Soviet Red Army entered Northeast China,
    The Japanese devils collapsed with a crash.
    The workers turned over and became masters,
    Creating wonders with their own hands:
    Pieces of scrap iron turned into finished products,
    One dead locomotive after another resurrected!
    The broken locomotive from Zhaodong was pulled into the factory,
    Everyone said, "Let's fix it!"
    Check it thoroughly and set a plan,
    Explain it clearly with everyone chiming in:
    "Find a way to get the missing parts,
    No difficulty, however great, can scare us!"
    Once the plan was set, get to work,
    The engine roared,
    The belts spun,
    All the machines in the factory were busy:
    The lathe chuckled as it ground,
    The shaper kept on going,
    The electric welder spat out millions of sparks,
    The steel saw ran like a racehorse;
    Turning, shaping,
    Welding, riveting,
    Replacing, installing,
    Sweat poured down from tireless hands...
    Repair the boiler, mend the air tank,
    Headlights and generators all installed,
    Spray paint, scrape patterns, electroplate, and cast letters,
    The locomotive is decorated like a bridal sedan!
    Everyone had long decided:
    Name it "Mao Zedong Locomotive"!
    Four golden characters were installed on the front,
    Applause like firecrackers…
    Some said: "Chairman Mao's name shines brightly,
    Like the sun shining all over the world!"
    Some said: "When we see his name,
    We feel strong and full of energy!"
    Everyone shouted in unison,
    "We'll take the lead on the production front!"
    As soon as the task was assigned,
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive roared to the sky,
    The bronze bell rang and it sped forward,
    Running! Running! Running fast...

           II

    Northwest wind, stings the face,
    Snowflakes fall and the ground freezes.
    The green wheat seedlings are not afraid of the cold,
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive rumbles forward...
    The driver is called Li Yong,
    Staring with red eyes,
    Big hands gripping the brakes,
    Shoulders carrying a heavy burden:
    The train is full of grain and ammunition,
    To be delivered to the front-line Liberation Army.
    Li Yong is fifty years old this year,
    But he is more agile than young people;
    He has been credited twice for preventing accidents,
    Everyone calls him "Old Hero"!
    He was born without an inch of land to stand on,
    Worked as a hired hand and suffered endlessly.
    The land is the apple of his eye,
    How could he let the Chiang bandits occupy even half an inch!
    At seventeen, he went to work on the railway as a laborer,
    And was slapped countless times.
    The Communist Party helped him turn over,
    And he must never fall upside down again!
    He drives the locomotive carefully,
    Ears perked up to listen closely,
    And uses his nose to smell, (Note 1)
    Preventing accidents like preventing enemies.
    The locomotive is like his own horse,
    Completely obedient to his orders;
    Go fast when told, slow down when told,
    Never allow it to break down halfway!
    The green wheat seedlings have deep roots,
    The old hero drives steadily and surely;
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive flies like a charge,
    With wind and snow rolling wildly behind it...

           III

    The Mao Zedong Locomotive runs non-stop,
    The crew members are in high spirits;
    They stick to their posts and are not afraid of hardship,
    Day and night on the train.
    Li Yong said, "We are all made of steel,
    Steel knows no fatigue!"
    Everyone talks and laughs:
    "Liberate Northeast China, fight to Nanjing,
    Capture Chiang Kai-shek, the dog bastard, alive,
    Peel his skin and carve out his heart!"
    Li Yong said, "Revolution is our own business,
    We must all strive to be the first to perform meritorious service!"
    Enemy planes dart overhead,
    Buzzing like flies...
    Li Yong jumped off the locomotive and shouted:
    "Quick, climb the branches and insert them on top of the train!"
    Everyone immediately did it,
    And the locomotive was disguised like a forest.
    The planes bombed wildly,
    And every bomb missed.
    Then the enemy bombarded with artillery,
    Li Yong quickly opened the throttle with both hands.
    The shells flew over the top of the locomotive,
    He opened the throttle fully and charged forward.
    Calmly and bravely holding the handle steady,
    Like a soldier charging to kill the enemy...
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive drove to the front lines,
    The soldiers cheered when they saw it,
    And held Li Yong's hand tightly,
    Praising him for making the first contribution!
    The bronze bell on the front of the train rang loudly,
    For the meritorious service of supporting the front lines.
    A silk banner fluttered everywhere,
    With "Locomotive Leader" shining in gold.

           IV

    Li Yong speaks frankly:
    "We must not be proud,
    We must learn skills well from the Soviet Union,
    Establishing the 'Responsibility System' is the most important thing!"
    Old driver, Liu Guobao,
    Has a set of driving skills,
    Two thick black eyebrows standing up,
    Eyes glancing, head shaking,
    He said, "Responsible or not,
    The train will run anyway!"
    Stoker Zhang Jiangong is young,
    A round face shining with red light,
    Black eyes rolling around,
    Quick-witted and outspoken:
    "I think Old Liu is too proud,
    Talking nonsense without reason!"
    Old Liu looked up to the sky and said:
    "Do you know how high the sky is?
    A full bottle doesn't rattle, a half-empty bottle makes a lot of noise!"
    Li Yong did not speak, but thought in his heart:
    Old Liu's bad habit has not been corrected,
    He once said, "If you can make the train fly,
    I can drive it to the sky."
    Li Yong took the lead in wiping the train,
    Old Liu lay on the roof of the train and sang.
    Li Yong took a brick to grind the link rod,
    Sweat drops pattered down...
    Xiao Zhang said, "Old hero, take a break!"
    Li Yong said, "The locomotive has put in the effort,
    We must protect its health well,
    We rely on it to fight the reactionaries!
    The task is down, the train must run."
    Old Liu jumped off the train with a whoop,
    And picked up a cotton cloth to wipe the lathe.
    Xiao Zhang squinted his eyes,
    Deliberately joking with him:
    "Wiping the train is the job of our laborers,
    You should go to the train and sleep!"
    Old Liu flashed his black eyebrows and said:
    "Xiao Zhang, don't joke,
    I listened to a few words from the old hero,
    Like the headlights illuminating the way;
    The reactionaries are our mortal enemies,
    I have worked for fifteen years and am about to break my back,
    Children starved to death, wife ate chaff,
    People stepping on our heads..."
    He stretched out his fist and shouted loudly:
    "In the past, I had skills but no place to use them,
    Today I will use all my skills!"
    Li Yong said, "Implement the responsibility system,
    Everyone is the master of the locomotive,
    Work responsibilities are clearly divided,
    Everyone uses their skills!"
    Xiao Zhang said, "I didn't learn anything in the past,
    In the future, I can learn skills!"
    Li Yong said, "The responsibility system, must be done well,
    Save coal when burning.
    Implement the 'three shovel system' for adding coal,
    Add coal once every twenty or thirty seconds.
    Add coal to the white fire,
    If you press it on the red fire, it is difficult to raise steam.
    If you desperately add coal,
    It will become a turtle-shell fire and go out,
    If you are lazy and add less coal,
    The steam won't rise and the train will stop.
    Large pieces of coal should be broken,
    Easy to ignite when burning;
    Small pieces of coal should be watered,
    Don't let it leak, waste a penny!"
    Xiao Zhang rolled his eyes and said:
    "The old hero is really skilled,
    I have been burning coal for more than three years,
    And I didn't know this."
    Li Yong said, "The Soviet experience is very good,
    I only learned half of it,
    We must seize the time to study!"
    Everyone added oil to wipe the locomotive,
    Wiping it so that it shines brightly all over.

           V

    Under Li Yong's enthusiastic guidance;
    Xiao Zhang made rapid progress.
    Li Yong taught him technical skills,
    Doing and talking at the same time.
    Xiao Zhang was quick-witted and quick-handed, remembering firmly,
    Studying hard and not afraid of difficulties.
    When Li Yong talked about the Soviet manipulation method,
    Xiao Zhang smiled happily:
    "Old hero, good teacher,
    Teaching us what you know.
    The Soviet experience is the most scientific,
    We can use it as soon as we learn it."
    Old hero, smiling,
    Patting him on the shoulder and saying: "Building a new China needs you!"
    In Xiao Zhang's heart:
    He had long hoped to drive the train and fly!
    When Xiao Zhang saw Liu Guobao,
    His black eyes rolled;
    He shouted loudly at Old Liu:
    "The Soviet experience is very, very good!"
    Old Liu said, "You are blindly copying things you don't understand, (Note 2)
    When I was driving a train, you couldn't even run!"
    Xiao Zhang grasped the truth and criticized him:
    "You are an old-fashioned conservative,
    It is difficult to improve without learning from the Soviet experience!
    Working is like a blind man riding a blind horse,
    I'm afraid you'll drive off the road!"
    Old Liu was so anxious that his eyebrows stood up:
    "You say my work is not good?
    The old hero still says my skills are good!"
    Xiao Zhang said, "I will have an opinion if you don't study."
    Old Liu was unconvinced in his heart,
    And wanted to show him his skills.
    Old Liu accepted the driving order,
    To drive from Yimianpo to Harbin.
    He was happy in his heart and decided,
    To show Xiao Zhang his skills.
    As the train passed Mifeng Station uphill,
    Xiao Zhang added coal and the fire was raging.
    Old Liu did not know that the steel rails were frozen because of the cold,
    Opened the throttle wide and rushed forward,
    Climbing higher and higher to go uphill quickly,
    A smile appeared on Old Liu's face.
    His eyes looked at Xiao Zhang as if saying:
    "See if my skills are good?"
    Who knew that before he could say the words,
    The locomotive was huffing and puffing and could not move.
    Watching the steam gauge drop,
    Old Liu panicked and was afraid of losing face,
    Complaining that Xiao Zhang could not get the steam up.
    Xiao Zhang said, "See how skilled you are?"
    Old Liu wished he could give him a punch,
    But he only heard Xiao Zhang roar, "Old hero!"
    Li Yong was lying in the camping car,
    He hadn't slept last night driving the train.
    He was only afraid of accidents in his heart,
    Blinking his eyes, he could hardly close them.
    Suddenly he heard a noise from the locomotive,
    And heard Xiao Zhang shout loudly,
    He immediately put on his cotton coat and jumped out of bed,
    Listening carefully to the noise, he understood in his heart:
    The locomotive was spinning in the air,
    If the "sheep are released" and the car overturns, (Note 3)
    How much state property will be lost?
    Immediately took Xiao Zhang to spread sand,
    And turned around to hold the brake handle.
    Old Liu stood aside without saying a word,
    Xiao Zhang furiously burned the fire,
    He saw that the old hero was quick-handed and steady,
    Opened the throttle a little and slowly increased it,
    The locomotive rumbled uphill...
    Li Yong saw that the time was delayed by twenty minutes,
    He did not argue with Old Liu.
    Watching the downhill and then uphill,
    Using inertia to rush upwards. (Note 4)
    Xiao Zhang happily shouted:
    "Running fast, running well!"
    Old Liu lowered his head when he heard it,
    A word ran into his heart:
    "It is difficult to improve without learning from the Soviet experience!"
    Familiar with the line and clear about the road,
    Li Yong rushed to make up time, and the car flew, (Note 5)
    Driving all the way to Harbin,
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive arrived on time.
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive ran safely,
    Maintained well without accidents.
    Having run more than one hundred and thirty-nine thousand kilometers,
    The second silk banner was hung on the front of the train.

           VI

    The Mao Zedong Locomotive is going to enter the pass,
    To serve as a model for locomotives across the country.
    Hero driver Guo Shude was transferred,
    Li Yong talked to him in detail...
    Communist Party member Guo Shude,
    Kept the task given by the Party in mind:
    "The Mao Zedong Locomotive is the national banner,
    You must guarantee that you add to the merit!"
    He chatted with everyone,
    Talking about life, work, and thoughts.
    Caring for everyone like a brother,
    Asking about their well-being, warmth, and hunger.
    In less than a few days, everyone supported him,
    Li Yong treated him like a family member.
    He understood the situation of each person,
    Knowing that Old Liu and Xiao Zhang had disagreements.
    He discussed it with Li Yong,
    And the criticism meeting was opened immediately:
    Li Yong said: "Our Mao Zedong Locomotive has made achievements,
    All thanks to everyone's hard work!
    I, as the driver, have shortcomings,
    So some people have disagreements.
    We work together,
    Like grapes on the same vine;
    Workers all over the world are one family,
    Family members should be kind and loving to each other!"
    Xiao Zhang blinked his eyes,
    He said: "I have an opinion about Old Liu,
    Climbing the slope at Mifeng Station, he said I couldn't get the steam up,
    He shouldn't shirk responsibility!"
    Old Liu's neck was thick and his face turned red,
    He stammered and started to speak:
    "I'm wrong! I'm wrong!
    I really shouldn't have...
    But that day when we arrived in Harbin,
    You called me 'King of Bragging' and made me lose face..."
    Then everyone made suggestions:
    "Chairman Mao tells us to wash our faces every day,
    Don't cover up your own shortcomings!"
    "Old Liu must change his attitude towards labor,
    Not learning from the Soviet experience is a big shortcoming!
    Being proud just because you have some skills,
    Being able to show off that day on the uphill;
    Opening the throttle wide is very risky,
    The locomotive leaked air and spun in the air..."
    "If the old hero hadn't helped,
    How could we have explained it if we couldn't get up the slope?"
    "You don't know how many bowls of rice you can eat,
    In the future, you must humbly learn from the good Soviet experience!"
    "Xiao Zhang is making progress quickly,
    You shouldn't just pick on others' eyes;
    When looking at people, look more at their strengths,
    Pay attention to your own problems!"
    Red and green signals clearly identify the road,
    He found the shortcomings of both of them;
    Impulsive signals are not allowed, (Note 6)
    You must correct your mistakes when you know them.
    Xiao Zhang said, "Look at me in the future!"
    Old Liu said, "I dare not be proud again!"
    Guo Shude said, "Good,
    Comrades are all reasonable,
    Overcome the shortcomings one by one,
    Everyone unite with one heart.
    Chairman Mao said: 'The first step of the Long March',
    We carry the task of construction on our shoulders.
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive runs all over China,
    We must add merit to the merit!"

           VII

    The Mao Zedong Locomotive runs into the pass,
    With Chairman Mao's portrait hanging on its head.
    Flying all the way like a dragon,
    The whistle roared and shook the sky...
    The peasants tilling the land looked up,
    Waving and welcoming happily.
    The wheat seedlings stand tall on the ground,
    An endless green ocean.
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive arrived in Fengtai,
    Gongs and drums roared loudly.
    The welcome meeting was great,
    Everyone shouted, "Learn from the Mao Zedong Locomotive!"
    The crew of the Mao Zedong Locomotive,
    Went to each locomotive group to ask about their well-being.
    Introducing the Soviet experience of the responsibility system,
    Explaining the work system little by little.
    Some people were afraid that the responsibility system would make the work heavier,
    Some people said, "The old way is still the best!"
    Li Yong was like an old mother,
    Smiling and speaking slowly:
    "In the past, when we drove the train,
    The locomotive was not of one mind with us!
    When taking over the train, we didn't know if it was sick,
    It clanked halfway,
    You had no idea in your heart,
    Can you blame the sky, the earth, and your parents?
    Talking nonsense about driving is taking a chance,
    You have to burn incense to avoid accidents.
    Since the establishment of the responsibility system,
    We take care of one locomotive.
    We see if it has problems,
    And have an idea in our hearts.
    Driving is not taking a chance,
    You don't need to burn incense to mud bodhisattvas.
    Usually take good care of it,
    Like soldiers cherish their guns!
    If you feed the horse well, it will run fast,
    If the locomotive is well maintained, its life will be long!"
    Old Liu said, "Not at all fake,
    Look at how brightly we have wiped our locomotive!
    In the past, we workers were cattle and horses,
    Wanting to manage the locomotive was a dream;
    Now we have become masters,
    Managing the locomotive happily..."
    Xiao Zhang said, "I miss the locomotive when I don't see it,
    My hands itch when I see it if I don't wipe it!"
    Old Liu's black eyebrows flashed,
    And carefully explained everything in detail:
    "In the past, I didn't know the responsibility system,
    I didn't know how the Soviet experience was?
    I thought I was pretty good at driving,
    I almost released the sheep once;
    Everyone helped me find the root of the problem,
    I thought about it carefully in my heart:
    What did I learn after being a driver for fifteen years?
    Just knowing that the locomotive eats coal and drinks water,
    How can it run,
    It's difficult to explain the theory.
    Since the establishment of the responsibility system,
    I understand the structure of the locomotive;
    I have a way to drive,
    I can fix it when I find a problem."
    Everyone understood in their hearts after hearing it,
    And wanted to do it!
    Li Yong took the lead in making an acceptance inspection, (Note 7)
    Everyone followed him and started working.
    Each locomotive shone brightly,
    Like seeing the sun after the rain.
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive won an award,
    Li Yong said, "This is everyone's credit!"
    Minister Teng pinned a red flower on Li Yong,
    Calling on, "Learn from the Mao Zedong Locomotive!"

           VIII

    Li Yong went abroad to the Soviet Union,
    He said, "I want to learn construction experience!"
    Everyone sent him to the train,
    Asking him to say hello to Stalin.
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive accepted a new task,
    Hurrying to Zhengzhou...
    Guo Shude said, "Let's work harder,
    To be a role model for the whole country!"
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive arrived in Zhengzhou,
    Everyone cheered when they saw it,
    "Look at how the black gold shines!"
    There was a driver named Tian Fusheng,
    He smiled and touched the rocker arm and said:
    "Not a bit of oil got on my hands!"
    Everyone said, "They have wiped it so well,
    Can't we wipe it clean?"
    Originally, the locomotives in Zhengzhou,
    Had a nickname called "Oil Wrap"!
    Oil flowed everywhere in the locomotive,
    The "shift system" meant that no one cared about the dirty locomotive.
    Locomotives often had problems,
    Lock worn out and burned the axle...
    Tian Fusheng saw Guo Shude,
    Taking the lead in wiping the car with a smile,
    Like a piece of meat on his heart,
    And didn't throw away the used cotton!
    Rarely used kerosene to wash,
    Not wasting a bit of oil!
    Seeing it brighter and better wiped,
    Nodding and praising it.
    And then looking at his own oil-wrapped car,
    Like there were needle tips pricking his heart...
    Guo Shude introduced to him:
    "The responsibility system is great,
    The performance of the locomotive is understood.
    Maintenance, insurance, and safety are all done well,
    Production efficiency is increasing step by step!"
    Tian Fusheng said, "The shift system,
    Is really sweeping in one direction and dumping in another;
    The locomotive is a mess,
    Production efficiency has been declining!"
    Guo Shude said with a smile:
    "To be a good master,
    Farmers turn over and get land,
    Deep plowing and careful cultivation make the seedlings strong.
    We turn over and manage the locomotive,
    Careful inspection, diligent wiping and safe running!"
    The crew of the Mao Zedong Locomotive,
    Helped to wipe the locomotive number 1554.
    Everyone was moved and started to work,
    Each locomotive was wiped clean.
    The shift system was abandoned,
    The responsibility system was established.
    Like farmers who have turned over and love the land,
    Smiling as they look at the locomotive...
    Tian Fusheng said, "Land is a treasure bowl,
    Golden flowers grow in the treasure bowl!
    The locomotive is a money tree,
    Gold coins grow on the money tree!"
    The locomotive shines all over,
    Tian Fusheng jumped up and down and shouted:
    "The responsibility system is like a miracle cure,
    Our oil-wrapped car has been cured.
    The dirtiest locomotive is number 2204,
    It has now become younger!"
    Shaft burning and wear are reduced,
    No one calls it "Oil Wrap" anymore.
    Everyone said: "We have transformed with our own hands,
    We learned a set of Mao Zedong Locomotive experience!"

          IX

    The vanguard of the road, the Mao Zedong Locomotive,
    Safely ran one hundred and sixty thousand kilometers.
    Continue to work hard without being proud.
    It went from Zhengzhou to Yancheng,
    Pulling a total of one thousand nine hundred and fifty tons,
    Going uphill on a slope...
    Mountain after mountain, ridge after ridge,
    The crew of the Mao Zedong Locomotive with one heart:
    Workers are the main force in building the country,
    We must complete the task given by the superiors!
    Wheat ears along the way are like gold,
    The peasants sang "The East is Red...".
    Passing through villages and climbing slopes,
    The Mao Zedong Locomotive has infinite power!
    Driver Guo Shude held the brake,
    Like a helmsman steering the rudder.
    The sea is wavy and the ship is not stable,
    The locomotive is most difficult to go uphill.
    He raised the reversing gear to forty percent, (Note 8)
    Creating a new record, his whole body was full of energy.
    His two eyes shone brightly,
    Seeing the road ahead clearly.
    Uphill, downhill, through the cave,
    The whistle echoed throughout the mountains...
    Like winning a great victory,
    Guo Shude lowered the brake and entered Yancheng.
    Arriving thirty-three minutes early,
    Saving more than four thousand kilograms of coal.
    Everyone applauded and praised:
    "The Mao Zedong Locomotive has opened a path,
    We must follow it forward!"
    Zhengzhou Bureau, hot and lively,
    The model locomotive movement is like a tide;
    Ninety locomotives safely traveling 10,000 kilometers,
    Countless large and small "Mao Zedong Locomotives" emerge...

           X

    Applause like thunder,
    Countless eyes looked at Li Yong;
    Shouts booming:
    "Welcome our old hero!"
    He returned from the Soviet Union with a smiling face,
    He said, "Comrades, fellow workers,
    The old society scolded us stinky workers,
    Now I have become a student studying abroad!"
    Everyone applauded, laughed, and shouted:
    "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao,
    Our future is infinitely bright!"
    Li Yong said, "Yes!
    Soviet workers enjoy endless happiness,
    They have houses and cars,
    And spend their rest time reading and playing the piano."
    Everyone said, "Really good!"
    He said: "After the success of the Soviet October Revolution,
    Imperialism caused trouble and there were many difficulties.
    The people ate black bread,
    And resolutely struggled with hardship.
    Following Lenin with one heart,
    A socialist country was built!
    Today we have difficulties,
    As long as we follow Mao Zedong!
    Let's use our hands and brains,
    And take the Soviet experience as a compass;
    Difficulties will be eliminated!
    The Liberation Army fights to where the railway is built to where,
    Railways will be built all over the mainland.
    Everyone did not bow their heads to difficulties,
    And countless heroes emerged..."
    Everyone clapped and cheered,
    Stretching out their fists and shouting in unison:
    "We want to be great heroes of the people!"
    Li Yong said: "The Soviet construction is really good,
    Let me talk about the subway;
    Moscow's subway is like a palace,
    Electric trains run day and night;
    The stations are all made of marble,
    The electric lights shine brightly;
    On the marble walls,
    People's heroes are carved well;
    The Soviet people respect heroes,
    Heroes wear gold medals all over their chests...
    "We saw Stalin,
    Everyone called him the great savior of mankind!
    He is seventy years old this year,
    His face is rosy and looks like a young man.
    He leads the Soviet people,
    Building a free and happy good time!
    We paid our respects to him,
    Wishing him longevity like the old pine trees of the Southern Mountains!"
    "We are welcomed everywhere,
    The Soviet people shouted 'Hurrah! Mao Zedong!'"
    He pointed to Chairman Mao's portrait with his hand:
    "We will enjoy happiness if we follow him!"
    He pointed his finger far away,
    Everyone could see clearly:
    The red star of Moscow shines in all directions,
    Standing the auspicious human star Stalin!
    Millions of arms stretched out in unison,
    Only hearing slogans all over the place,
    Like ten thousand horses rushing forward:
    "There are difficulties, there are solutions, there is hope,
    We want to build a rich and beautiful new China!"

    (Note 1) "Listening with your ears" and "smelling with your nose" are the experience of old drivers. When the locomotive is running, listen with your ears to see if there is any noise. If there is noise, the parts have problems. Smell with your nose to see if there is a burning axle and stuck brake smell.
    (Note 2) "Six tracks" When the train enters the station, the switchman must move the correct track, so don't make a mistake. "Blinds moving six tracks" is a railway worker idiom, referring to someone who doesn't understand and talks nonsense. The sentence below "I'm afraid you will drive off the road" means "derailed".
    (Note 3) "Releasing the sheep" means that the train is driven to the slope, but cannot go up and slides down, and it will overturn.
    (Note 4) "Using inertia" means that when the train is going downhill, the throttle is closed, and the inertia of the object falling from top to bottom is used, so that the coal and gasoline can be saved.
    (Note 5) "Rushing" There is a scheduled running time for trains from the departure station to the terminal. If time is delayed in the middle, it must be driven quickly to make up the time, so that the train arrives on time. If it cannot arrive on time, it is considered an accident.
    (Note 6) "Dangerous signal" means driving into the car regardless of the signal, that is, driving into the car when the red light is on, which is dangerous.
    (Note 7) "Acceptance inspection" When the locomotive is overhauled, it is divided into three types: A, B, and C according to the degree of damage.
    (Note 8) "The reversing gear is raised to 40%", the reversing gear is for adjusting the size of the steam. Raising it to 40% can use the expansion force of the steam to travel, which is now the most suitable driving method, which can save steam and coal. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the reversing gear was raised to 50%, which wasted steam and coal and easily damaged the parts.

　　“毛泽东号”
    路工
    “……我们铁路工人，在过去有林祥谦等英雄人物。在最近几年的解放战争中，又出现了像‘毛泽东号’的李永同志这样的劳动英雄……………”
    ——李立三同志在中国铁路工会全国代表大会上讲话。
           一
    有辆破机车，
    断腿缺胳膊，
    抛在肇东站，
    受尽风雨打，
    没人理会它，
    好比死了的马。
    苏联红军进东北，
    日本鬼子哗的一下垮。
    工人翻身当了家，
    双手创造本领大：
    一块块废铁变成品，
    一辆辆死车复活啦。
    肇东破车拉进厂，
    大家都说：“修好它！”
    检查一遍定计划，
    七嘴八舌说明白：
    “缺少零件想办法，
    天大困难吓不倒咱！”
    订好计划动手干，
    引擎轰隆隆响起来；
    皮带骨落落跟着转，
    全厂机器都忙开：
    旋床打磨嗤儿笑，
    一直不停虎头刨，
    电焊喷出火花千万朵，
    钢锯拉得赛马跑；
    旋的旋，刨的刨，
    焊的焊，铆的铆，
    换的换，装的装，
    双手不停汗直淌……
    修锅炉，补风缸，
    前灯、发电机都装好，
    喷漆、刮花、电镀又铸字，
    机车打扮得像花轿！
    大家心中早想好：
    取名就叫“毛泽东号”！
    四个金字装在车头上，
    掌声好比放鞭炮………
    有的说：“毛主席名字放光芒，
    好比太阳普天照！”
    有的说：“咱们见到他名字，
    浑身有劲气力壮！”
    大家一齐都叫好，
    “生产战线上咱们带头跑！”
    马上任务下来了，
    毛泽东号冲天叫，
    铜钟一响奔前方，
    跑呀！跑呀！飞快跑……
           二
    西北风，刮脸痛，
    雪花纷纷土地冻。
    绿油油麦苗不怕冷，
    毛泽东号隆隆向前冲……
    开车司机叫李永，
    瞪着双眼红通通，
    芭蕉大手掌把住闸，
    肩上担子千斤重：
    满车子粮食和子弹，
    要送给前线解放军。
    李永今年五十岁，
    他比年青人还机灵；
    防止事故立过两次功，
    大家称他“老英雄”！
    他生下没有插脚土，
    当过长工受尽苦。
    土地是他心头肉，
    怎肯让蒋匪占半寸！
    十七岁跑到铁路上当小工，
    挨过耳光数不清。
    共产党扶他翻了身，
    决不能来个倒栽葱！
    他开着机车挺操心，
    竖起耳根细细听，
    再用鼻子闻一闻，（注一）
    防事故像防敌人。
    机车像他自喂马，
    十分服从听命令；
    叫快就快，慢就慢，
    不准它发生故障半路停！
    青青麦苗根底深，
    老英雄开车稳又稳；
    毛泽东号飞行像冲锋，
    背后风雪乱打滚………
           三
    毛泽东号不停跑，
    乘务员们精神好；
    坚守岗位不怕苦，
    白天黑夜在车上。
    李永说：“咱们都是钢，
    钢铁不知啥疲劳！”
    大家有说又有笑：
    “解放东北打南京，
    活捉蒋介石狗杂种，
    剥他皮来剜他心！”
    李永说：“革命是咱自己事，
    咱们都要争先去立功！”
    敌人飞机窜头上，
    嗡嗡嗡嗡像苍蝇……
    李永跳下机车叫：
    “快攀树枝插车顶！”
    他一下手大家干，
    马上机车伪装像树林。
    飞机胡乱炸一阵，
    个个炸弹落了空。
    接着敌人把炮轰，
    李永双手飞快开汽门。
    炮弹飞过机车顶，
    他开足汽门往前冲。
    沉着勇敢稳掌把，
    好比战士冲锋杀敌人……
    毛泽东号开前线，
    战士们一见都欢腾，
    紧紧拉住李永的手，
    夸他立了第一功！
    车头上铜钟响当当，
    支援前线有功劳。
    一面锦旗到处飘，
    上写“机车领袖”闪金光。
           四
    李永说话直趟趟：
    “咱们不能骄傲，
    好好向苏联学本领，
    建立‘负责制’最重要！”
    老司机，刘国保，
    开车技术有一套，
    竖竖两道黑眉毛，
    眼睛一瞟头一摇，
    他说：“负责不负责，
    反正火车它会跑！”
    司炉张建功年纪青，
    圆滚滚脸蛋闪红光，
    乌溜溜眼珠一转动，
    心灵嘴快话出口：
    “我看老刘太骄傲，
    不讲道理瞎唠叨！”
    老刘眼睛朝天讲：
    “你知道天多高？
    满瓶不响，半瓶乱晃荡！”
    李永不说心中想：
    老刘毛病没改掉，
    他说过：“你能叫火车飞，
    我就能把它开天上。”
    李永带头去擦车，
    老刘躺在车顶唱。
    李永拿砖磨链杆，
    满头汗珠扑落落掉……
    小张说：“老英雄息息吧！”
    李永说：“机车出了力，
    要好好保护它健康，
    咱们靠它去打反动派！
    任务下来车要跑。”
    老刘呼一下跳下车，
    拿起棉丝擦车床。
    小张眼一眯，
    故意给他开玩笑：
    “擦车是咱小工干的活，
    你还是到车上去睡觉！”
    老刘闪着黑眉毛说：
    “小张不要开玩笑，
    我听了老英雄几句话，
    好比车头上前灯照明道；
    反动派是咱死对头，
    我干了十五年快折断腰，
    小孩饿死老婆吃糠，
    人家的脚跺在咱头上……。”
    他拳头一伸大声叫：
    “过去有本领没处用，
    今天我要把本领都用上。”
    李永讲：“实行负责制，
    大家都是机车主人翁，
    工作责任都分清，
    谁有本领使上劲！”
    小张说：“过去没有学到啥，
    今后咱能学本领！”
    李永讲：“负责制、要做好，
    烧火用煤要节省。
    添煤实行‘三锹制’，
    添一次煤隔二三十秒钟。
    煤要添到白火上，
    压到红火汽难升。
    你要拚命去添煤，
    变成一个龟盖火灭尽，
    你要偷懒少添煤，
    烧不上汽，火车停。
    大块煤炭要摔碎，
    烧起火来容易升；
    小块煤碴要浇水，
    不让漏下，浪费钱一分！”
    小张眼珠一滚说：
    “老英雄真是有本领，
    咱烧火三年多，
    还不知道这事情。”
    李永说：“苏联经验好得很，
    我才学个半不通，
    咱们学习要抓紧！”
    大家加油擦机车，
    擦得它全身照眼明。
           五
    李永热心指导下；
    小张进步十分快。
    李永教他学技术，
    一边做，一边谈。
    小张眼明手快心记牢，
    埋头钻研不怕难。
    李永讲到苏联操纵法，
    小张乐得笑眯眼：
    “老英雄呀好师傅，
    知道一点就教咱。
    苏联经验最科学，
    咱学上就能使用它。”
    老英雄，笑嘻嘻，
    拍拍他肩头说：“建设新中国需要你！”
    小张心眼里：
    早盼开着火车嘟嘟飞！
    小张一见刘国保，
    乌溜溜眼珠打滚了；
    他对着老刘高声叫：
    “苏联经验好好好！”
    老刘说：“你瞎搬六股道，（注二）
    我会开火车时你还不会跑！”
    小张抓住理批评他：
    “你是保守主义老一套，
    不学习苏联经验难提高！
    工作也是盲人骑瞎马，
    我怕你开车掉了道！”
    老刘急得眉毛翘：
    “你说我工作不好吗？
    老英雄还说我技术好！”
    小张说：“你不学习我就有意见。”
    老刘心中不服气，
    要拿出本领给他瞧。
    老刘接受开车令，
    从一面坡开往哈尔滨。
    心中高兴主意定，
    要叫小张看本领。
    车过密峰站上坡道，
    小张添煤火熊熊。
    老刘不知天冷钢轨冻，
    大开汽门往前冲，
    越爬越高快上坡，
    老刘脸上露笑容。
    眼睛看着小张像说话：
    “瞧我技术行不行？”
    谁知话还没有说出口，
    机车呼噜呼噜跑不动。
    看着汽表往下降，
    老刘着慌怕丢人，
    埋怨小张烧不上汽。
    小张说：“瞧你有本领？”
    老刘恨不得送他一拳头，
    只听小张吼叫：“老英雄”！
    李永躺在宿营车，
    昨天夜里开车没睡觉。
    心中只怕出事故，
    眨眨眼睛难闭上。
    忽然听到机车响杂音，
    又听小张高声叫，
    立刻披上棉衣跳下床，
    细听杂音心里明：
    机车正在打空转，
    要是“放羊”车翻了，（注三）
    国家财产损失有多少？
    马上带着小张去撒沙，
    回头就把闸柄掌。
    老刘站在一边没话说，
    小张呼呼把火烧，
    他见老英雄手快又稳当，
    汽门小开慢慢提，
    机车轰轰朝上跑……
    李永一看时间耽误二十分，
    他不跟老刘去计较。
    眼看下坡又上坡，
    利用惰力往上闯。（注四）
    小张高高兴兴叫：
    “跑得快，跑得好！”
    老刘听见低下头，
    一句话儿跑到他心上：
    “不学习苏联经验难提高！”
    熟悉线路摸清道，
    李永抢点车飞跑，（注五）
    一直开到哈尔滨，
    毛泽东号正点到。
    毛泽东号安全跑，
    不出事故保养好。
    跑了十三万九千多公里，
    第二面锦旗挂在车头上。
           六
    毛泽东号要进关，
    给全国火车头作示范。
    调来英雄司机郭树德，
    李永和他细细谈……
    共产党员郭树德，
    党给的任务记心中：
    “毛泽东号是全国旗帜，
    你要保证功上再加功！”
    他和大家闲聊天，
    生活工作思想都谈遍。
    关心大家赛弟兄，
    问长问短问饥寒。
    不到几天都拥护他，
    李永当他亲人待。
    每个人情况都了解，
    知道老刘和小张闹意见。
    他和李永商量好，
    检讨会就马上开：
    李永说：“咱毛泽东号有成绩，
    全靠大家努力干！
    我当司机长有缺点，
    所以有人闹意见。
    咱们工作在一起，
    满架葡萄同根连；
    天下工人是一家，
    一家人要你亲我爱！”
    小张眼睛一忽闪，
    他说：“我对老刘有意见，
    爬密峰站坡道说我烧不上汽，
    他推卸责任不应该！”
    老刘脖子粗来脸发红，
    吱吱唔唔他说开：
    “我不对！我不对！
    我真是太不应该……
    可是那天到了哈尔滨，
    你叫我‘牛皮大王’丢我脸……”
    接着大家提意见：
    “毛主席叫天天洗脸，
    自己缺点不遮盖！”
    “老刘劳动态度要改变，
    不学苏联经验是个大缺点！
    有点技术就骄傲，
    那天上坡逞能干；
    大开汽门好冒险，
    机车泄气打空转……。”
    “要是老英雄不帮助，
    上不了坡怎交待？”
    “你不知道能吃几碗饭，
    以后要虚心学习苏联好经验！”
    “小张进步快，
    不应该光挑别人眼；
    看人要多看他优点，
    自己毛病要注意改！”
    红绿号志辨明道，
    他俩缺点都找到；
    冒进信号要不得，（注六）
    知道错误要改掉。
    小张说：“今后瞧！”
    老刘说：“不敢再骄傲！”
    郭树德说声：“好，
    同志们都说在理上，
    缺点一个个要克服，
    大家团结心一条。
    毛主席说：‘万里长征第一步’，
    建设任务咱们肩上挑。
    毛泽东号开遍全中国，
    要在功劳上面加功劳！”
           七
    毛泽东号往关里跑，
    头上挂着毛主席像。
    一路飞行像条龙，
    汽笛一叫震天响……
　  锄地的庄稼汉抬头看，
    招手欢迎喜洋洋。
    满地麦苗挺着腰，
    望不尽一片绿海洋。
    毛泽东号到丰台，
    锣鼓喧天咚咚锵。
    欢迎大会开得好，
    都喊：“学习毛泽东号！”
    毛泽东号乘务员，
    到各机车小组问短长。
    介绍苏联经验负责制，
    把工作制度一点点讲。
    有人怕负责制工作重，
    有人说：“还是老一套能吃香！”
    李永好比老妈妈，
    笑容满脸慢慢讲：
    “从前我们开车的，
    机车不跟咱一心肠！
    接车不知它有病，
    开到半路喀嚓响，
    自己心里没主张，
    你能怨天怨地怪爹娘？
    瞎说开车是闯大运，
    不出事故要烧香。
    自从建立负责制，
    一台机车我们养。
    它有毛病我们看，
    自己心里有主张。
    开车不是闯大运，
    不用给泥菩萨去烧香。
    平时好好保养它，
    如同战士爱护枪！
    马儿喂壮跑得快，
    机车养好寿命长！”
    老刘说：“一点不假，
    你瞧咱机车擦得闪闪亮！
    过去咱当工人是牛马，
    想管机车是梦想；
    现在咱们成主人，
    管理机车喜洋洋……”
    小张说：“不见机车就想它，
    见着不擦手发痒！”
    老刘黑眉毛闪一下，
    一五一十仔细讲：
    “过去我不知道负责制，
    不知道苏联经验怎么样？
    觉得自己开车蛮能行，
    有一回差点放了羊；
    大家帮助我找病根，
    自己心里细细想：
    我当十五年司机学会啥？
    不过懂得机车吃煤喝水罢，
    到底怎么能走行，
    要说道理困难啦。
    自从建立负责制，
    机车构造我懂了；
    开起车来有办法，
    发现毛病能修它。”
    大家一听心里明白，
    都想动手干一场！
    李永带头作乙检，（注七）
    大家跟着他动手干。
    一台台机车都发亮，
    好比雨后见太阳。
    毛泽东号得了奖，
    李永说：“这是大家的功劳！”
    滕部长给李永挂红花，
    号召：“学习毛泽东号！”
           八
    李永出国去苏联，
    他说：“我要去学建设经验！”
    大家送他到车上，
    叫他向斯大林问好。
    毛泽东号接受新任务，
    唿隆隆往郑州开………
    郭树德说：“咱们加把劲，
    要做榜样给全国看！”
    毛泽东号到郑州，
    大家一见都叫好，
    “你瞧乌金般闪金光！”
    有位司机叫田福生，
    他笑着摸摸摇杆道：
    “一点油也没沾到我手上！”
    大家说：“人家擦得这么好，
    我们就不能擦亮吗？”
    原来郑州的机车，
    有个外号叫“油包”！
    机车里的油到处流，
    “轮班制”谁也不管机车脏。
    机车经常出毛病，
    锁子磨耗把轴烧……
    田福生看到郭树德，
    带头擦车满脸笑，
    像是心上一块肉，
    用过的棉丝不扔掉。
    轻易不用煤油洗，
    一点油也不浪费掉！
    看他越亮越好擦，
    不住点头叫着好。
    再去看看自己的油包车，
    像有针尖刺心上……
    郭树德给他来介绍：
    “负责制刮刮叫，
    机车性能都摸到。
    保修保险保乘都作好，
    生产效率步步高！”
    田福生说：“轮班制，
    真是东一扫帚西一筐；
    机车搞得一团糟，
    生产效率一直往下降！”
    郭树德笑着说：
    “当主人翁要当好，
    农民翻身得土地，
    深耕细作苗儿壮。
    咱们翻身管机车，
    细检勤擦安全跑！”
    毛泽东号乘务员，
    帮助擦好机车一五五四号。
    大家感动齐下手，
    一辆辆机车都擦光。
    轮班制，抛弃掉，
    负责制，建立好。
    都像翻身农民爱土地，
    瞧着机车眯眯笑……
    田福生说：“土地是聚宝盆，
    聚宝盆里长金花！
    机车是摇钱树，
    摇钱树上结元宝！”
    机车全身都发亮，
    田福生蹦蹦跳跳叫：
    “负责制真如灵丹妙方，
    咱油包车给治好。
    最脏的机车二二○四号，
    现在也变得年青了！”
    烧轴磨耗都减少，
    没有人再叫它“油包”。
    大家都说：“咱们双手改造，
    学了毛泽东号经验一套！”
          九
    开路先锋毛泽东号，
    十六万公里安全跑。
    继续努力不骄傲。
    它从郑州到郾城，
    一共拉了一千九百五十吨，
    一条坡道往上行……
    山连山，岭接岭，
    毛泽东号乘务员一条心：
    工人是建设国家主力军，
    上级给的任务要完成！
    一路上麦穗赛黄金，
    庄稼汉唱着“东方红……”。
    穿过村庄爬过坡，
    毛泽东号力量无穷尽！
    司机郭树德把住闸，
    好比舵手掌舵柄。
    海里起浪船不稳，
    机车上坡道最难行。
    他把逆转阀提到百分之四十，（注八）
    创造新纪录浑身都有劲。
    他两只眼睛闪闪明，
    前进道路看得清。
    上坡下坡过山洞，
    汽笛叫得满山应。……
    好比打了个大胜仗，
    郭树德下闸进郾城。
    时间提早三十三分，
    省煤四千多公斤。
    人人鼓掌都称赞：
    “毛泽东号开出路一条，
    我们要跟它向前进！”
    郑州局，热烘烘，
    模范机车运动像潮涌；
    九十台机车安全走行一万公里，
    大大小小“毛泽东号”出不尽……
           十
    掌声像雷动，
    数不清眼睛看李永；
    喊声轰隆隆：
    “欢迎咱们老英雄！”
    他从苏联回来满脸笑，
    他说：“同志们，工友们，
    旧社会骂我们臭工人，
    现在我当了个留洋生！”
    大家鼓掌又笑又是叫：
    “在毛主席领导下，
    我们前途无限光明！”
    李永说：“对呀！
    苏联工人幸福享不尽，
    有洋房，有汽车，
    休息时间看书弹钢琴。”
    大家都说“真美气”！
    他说：“苏联十月革命成功后，
    帝国主义捣乱，困难重重。
    人民吃着黑面包，
    坚决和苦难作斗争。
    一心跟着列宁走，
    社会主义国家建设成！
    今天我们有困难，
    只要跟着毛泽东！
    开动我们双手和大脑，
    把苏联经验当做指南针；
    困难管保消灭尽！
    解放军打到那里铁路修到那里，
    全国大陆上铁路都修通。
    大家没有向困难低头，
    出现了英雄数不清……”
    大家鼓掌齐欢腾，
    拳头伸起一齐喊：
    “咱们要当人民的大功臣！”
    李永说：“苏联建设真真好，
    我来讲一讲地下铁道；
    莫斯科地下赛皇宫，
    电气列车日夜跑；
    车站都是大理石造，
    电灯照得明晃晃；
    大理石的墙壁上，
    人民英雄雕得好；
    苏联人民敬英雄，
    英雄胸上挂满金奖章……
    “我们见到斯大林，
    大家叫他人类大救星！
    他今年七十高龄，
    满脸红光像个年青人。
    他领导苏联人民，
    建设自由幸福好光景！
    我们向他致敬礼，
    祝他寿比南山不老松！”
    “我们到处受欢迎，
    苏联人民高呼‘乌拉！毛泽东！’”
    他用手一指毛主席像：
    “我们跟着他走就有福享！”
    他用手一指指得老远，
    大家眼前看得清：
    莫斯科红星四方照，
    站着人类福星斯大林！
    千万条胳膊一齐伸，
    只听满场口号声，
    好比万马朝前奔：
    “有困难，有办法，有希望，
    我们要把新中国造得富丽堂皇！”
    （注一）“耳听”“鼻闻”是老司机的经验。机车走行时，用耳朵听是不是有杂音，有杂音，机件就有毛病。用鼻子闻是不是有燃轴和抢闸味。
    （注二）“六股道”火车进站时，搬道工搬好应走的一股道，不可弄错，“瞎搬六股道”是铁路工人熟语，指某人不懂事乱说。下面“我怕你开车掉了道”一句内的“掉了道”是“出轨”之意。
    （注三）“放羊”是火车开到坡上，上不去滑下来，就会翻了车。
    （注四）“利用惰力”就是火车下坡时，关住汽门，利用物体从上往下落的惰力，这样可以节煤省汽。
    （注五）“抢点”，列车从起发站到终点站，有规定行驶时间，要是在中途耽误了时间，就得快速开车，抢过时间来，使列车正点到达。要是不能正点到达，就算出了事故。
    （注六）“冒进信号”是不顾信号开进车去，就是红灯亮时开进车去，要出危险。
    （注七）“乙检”机车检修时，按走坏的程度分甲、乙、丙检三种。
    （注八）“逆转阀提到百分之四十”，逆转阀是调整蒸汽大小的，提到百分之四十，可以利用蒸汽膨胀力走行，是现在最合适的开车法，可以省汽省煤。过去国民党统治时，逆转阀都提到百分之五十，这样费汽费煤，又容易损坏机件。
