Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th: According to a report from the "Pravda" correspondent in New York: The broad masses of the American people are increasingly alarmed and anxious about the US government's heinous intervention in Korea. The protests of the American public against the US government's sinful adventurous actions are growing in scale. Every day, hundreds of thousands of Americans are signing the Stockholm Appeal for Peace. After adopting "summary judgment" tactics against the country's progressive movement, the US authorities are intensifying terror and persecution against peace advocates. A few days ago, six more progressive Hollywood writers were imprisoned. On July 4th, nine ordinary Americans were arrested in Philadelphia for collecting signatures on the Stockholm Declaration on the streets of that city. However, the use of harsh measures against peace advocates does not prove the strength of the American reactionaries. It only proves that the reactionaries are using extreme fascist methods to suppress the American people who are protesting the ruling group's policies and rising up to fight for peace, oppose aggression, and oppose war.

    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻纽约记者报道：广大的美国人民对美国政府在朝鲜从事的罪恶干涉，日益感到惊恐和焦虑。美国公众对美国政府的罪恶冒险行径的抗议，规模日益宏大。每天，都有成千上万的美国人在斯德哥尔摩的和平宣言上签名。美国当局在对本国的进步运动采用“即决审判”的手段之后，又正在加紧对和平拥护者施行恐怖措施和迫害。几天前，又有六个进步的好莱坞作家被投入狱中。七月四日，九个普通的美国人在费城被捕，因为他们在该市的街道上征集对斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名。然而，对和平拥护者们使用苛酷的手段并不证明美国反动派的有力。这只证明反动派使用极端的法西斯手段，企图镇压抗议统治集团的政策和起来争取和平反对侵略和战争的美国人民。
