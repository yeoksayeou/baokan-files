    Wage Issues in Tianjin's Private Banking Sector Returning to Normal
    Since the establishment of the wage agreement in Tianjin's private banking sector, both labor and management have been able to correctly handle wage issues based on the principle of mutual benefit and production development. Since the implementation of the agreement in May, employees in thirteen out of fifteen banks have been able to receive salaries as stipulated. The remaining banks, Dalu and Chongqing, have experienced business losses, with the former's employee wages reduced by 31 percent and the latter's reduced by 35 percent since April. Conversely, some banks with improved business, such as Yanye and Lianhe, have implemented wage increases to encourage employee morale and promote business development.

    Taiyuan Bathhouse Business Improving
    Labor-management relations in Taiyuan's bathhouse industry have returned to normal, and business has also made significant progress. In the past, the owner of Xinhua Lou bathhouse had ideological concerns and lacked confidence in operations, not accepting workers' opinions. However, after the workers adopted the correct approach of uniting, persuading, and actively working to improve business, the owner began to change, fulfilling the labor-management collective contract and accepting the workers' reasonable suggestions for saving expenses. As a result, from the Spring Festival to the end of April, the surplus was over four million yuan. The owner recently accepted workers' suggestions to add equipment such as towels, cushions, and white cloths, and also brushed the facade and improved cleanliness. Workers at Yonghe Yuan and Yu Mao Chi also launched a labor competition; Yu Mao Chi also set out reward methods, and as a result, both businesses' revenue increased by one-third.

    Labor and Management Sign Agreement - Xiangyin Pottery Kilns Begin to Resume Work
    Xiangyin County's Chengguan Town in Hunan Province originally had more than eighty pottery kilns. After liberation, most of them were shut down due to the concerns of the owners and the impact of last year's disaster, which led to slow product sales. After the local government carried out persuasion and education, labor and management reached an agreement and signed a contract. To take care of the owner's difficulties, the workers agreed to reduce wages and temporarily distribute them in five, six, or seven parts according to family economic conditions, with the remaining portion to be returned after the autumn harvest. The owner guaranteed to strive to resume work, find ways to place unemployed workers, and those who could not be placed would be responsible for the transportation of products and raw materials. After the agreement was established, some kilns have already resumed work. (Tang Shichun)

    天津私营银行业工资问题已趋正常
    天津市私营银行业自订立工资协定后，双方均能本劳资两利、发展生产的原则，正确处理工资问题。该协定自五月份实行，十五家银行中已有十三家职工，可按规定取得金薪。其余大陆、重庆两行因营业亏损，前者职工工资减低百分之三十一支付，后者从四月份减低百分之三十五。相反，某些营业好转的银行，如盐业、联合两行为鼓励职工情绪，推进业务的开展，实行加薪。

    太原澡塘业营业好转
    太原澡塘业的劳资关系已转趋正常，营业亦有显著进展。过去，新华楼澡塘资方思想有顾虑，不接受工人意见对经营没有信心。但从工人采取团结说服，积极劳动搞好营业的正确方法后，资方开始有了转变，履行了劳资集体合同，接受了工人提出有关节省开支的合理建议，因而从春节至四月底，盈余四百多万元。资方最近又接受工人建议，增添毛巾、座垫、白布等设备，并且刷洗门面，改善清洁卫生。永合园和浴茂池的工人也展开劳动竞赛；浴茂池并订出奖励办法，结果两家的营业收入都增加了三分之一。
