Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th, TASS: An Izvestia commentator describes Truman's policy as a war policy. The commentator says that the new war-mongers in the United States are dispatching new troops and equipment to Korea, attempting to expand the scale of American aggression in Korea. At the same time, anti-peace conspirators are trying to use the development of the Korean situation to intensify the sale of war propaganda, prepare provocations in other places, and accelerate the pace of militarization of the United States and its satellite countries. The commentator said that recently, after the United States began its aggression against Korea, the most arrogant new war instigators, warmongering atomic bomb advocates, and fascists have intensified their activities. Congressmen Brewster, Binson, and Leeves and others have submitted shameless proposals to Congress, advocating dropping atomic bombs on Korea. The aggressors are again using atomic blackmail tactics. The so-called International Committee for the Study of European Problems published a shameless report advocating the use of atomic bombs, which specifically proves this point. But this report aroused such fierce protests from the public that the reactionary figures of Britain and France, Vansittart, Palabozon, Renault, Schuman and others, had to announce their withdrawal from the above-mentioned committee to save face.

It is not difficult to understand that the reason why the United States government and the governments of other capitalist countries refuse proposals for peaceful resolution of problems based on international cooperation and intensify the arms race is to serve the interests of the monopoly capitalists in Wall Street and the London financial district. War instigators want to use the propaganda that war is inevitable to crush the masses' resistance to the sinister conspiracies of American imperialists. The extreme importance of the movement to defend peace lies in the fact that it dispels the lies of the enemies of peace. The commentator concluded by saying that the people of all countries will defend peace by strengthening their activities to fight for peace, so that it will not be violated by imperialist aggressors.

　　为美英垄断资本家谋利益
    美政府扩大侵朝战争     
    消息报斥杜鲁门战争政策
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：消息报评论员形容杜鲁门的政策为战争政策。评论员说，美国新战争挑拨者，派遣新的部队与装备到朝鲜去，力图扩大美国在朝鲜的侵略的规模。同时，反和平的阴谋家企图利用朝鲜局势的发展来加紧贩卖战争的宣传，准备在其他地方的挑衅，加速美国及其卫星国的军国主义化的速度。评论员说，最近，在美国开始侵略朝鲜后，最狂妄的新战争煽动者，好战的原子主义者与法西斯分子已经加紧活动。国会议员布鲁斯特、宾逊、李维斯之流，向国会提出无耻的建议，主张在朝鲜投掷原子弹。侵略者再度使用原子吓诈手段。所谓欧洲问题国际研究委员会公布了一项无耻报告，主张使用原子弹，特别证明了这一点。但这个报告激起公众这样猛烈的抗议，以至英法的反动派范西塔德、巴拉布宗、雷诺、舒曼及其他人，都不得不宣布退出上述的委员会以挽救颜面。
    不难了解，美国政府及其他资本主义国家政府所以拒绝在国际合作的基础上和平解决问题的建议，并加紧军备竞赛，是为华尔街和伦敦金融区的垄断资本家谋利益。战争挑拨者想用宣传战争是不可避免的办法，来粉碎群众对美国帝国主义者罪恶阴谋的抵抗。拥护和平运动的极重大意义在于：它驱散了和平的敌人的谎言。评论员结语称：各国人民将以加强为和平而战斗的活动，来保卫和平，使其不致受到帝国主义侵略者的侵犯。
