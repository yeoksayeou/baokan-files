Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st—The production experience of the famous Ma Hengchang Group of the Shenyang No. 5 Machine Factory of the Northeast Machinery Administration has been widely promoted in state-owned factories in Northeast China. In the past three months, this experience has expanded from Shenyang to Harbin, Changchun, Andong, Jinzhou, Dalian, and other places; and has gradually spread from heavy industry departments to light industry departments. At present, 45 Ma Hengchang-style production groups have emerged in the machinery, electrical, chemical, textile, rubber, and other industrial sectors of Shenyang.

　　When promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, general factories focus on specific aspects according to their own specific conditions. The No. 1 Machine Factory of the Northeast Machinery Administration, in response to the past lax inspection system that resulted in large waste due to high defect rates, focused on promoting the Ma Hengchang Group's system of "inspecting the first product first." In fourteen days, it prevented the production of defective products twenty-three times. After learning from the Ma Hengchang Group's experience of "holding production review meetings during spare time" and "technical research meetings" focusing on solving various technical problems in the production process, workers' operating skills were generally improved at the No. 7 Rubber Factory affiliated with the Light Industry Administration. Within ten days, the defect rate of the third group in the molding workshop dropped from 10% to 0.5%. In the past, the Liu Jinchen Group of the Second Silk Weaving Factory of the Liaodong Provincial State-Owned Tussah Silk Company often experienced accidents that affected production. After learning from the Ma Hengchang Group's experience of "implementing a strict shift handover system and technical mutual assistance" in early May, working hour losses in May decreased by 54% compared to April, which not only guaranteed the early completion of the monthly production task, but also improved the quality of the silk by 9% above the original standard.

　　Currently, the main deviations found in the promotion of the Ma Hengchang Group's experience are: some factory leaders one-sidedly believe that the Ma Hengchang Group's experience is only suitable for the machinery industry, and therefore have not adopted a positive attitude towards promoting this advanced experience; or they mechanically apply all of its systems and methods without considering the actual situation of their own factory, resulting in formalism. Therefore, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has decided to convene a representative meeting of Ma Hengchang-style groups at the end of this month to exchange experiences and discuss further promotion plans.

　　Note: The Ma Hengchang Group was originally a model group at the Shenyang No. 5 Machine Factory. Because it consistently maintained excellent product quality and completed production tasks ahead of schedule, it has successively won three award banners from the factory, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northeast Industrial Department. The group has created relatively mature experiences for solving the current problems of lack of responsibility and low product quality in industrial production in Northeast China. Its main experiences are: (1) Establishing a technical research association to study the production plans and drawings assigned to the group during the noon break, studying its key points and the places most likely to be treated carelessly, and paying attention to improvements. (2) Establishing a technical mutual aid group to solve temporary technical problems in production, which not only greatly helps improve the skills of apprentices and new workers, but also prevents the occurrence of defective products. (3) Establishing a clear division of labor and responsibility system for cleaning machines, storing tools, and exchanging shifts, strictly abiding by production discipline, and ensuring that production is orderly. A production review meeting is held once a week to quickly correct any shortcomings found. (4) Implementing the "inspect the first product first" system, overcoming the wasteful phenomenon of inspecting defective products after the fact, which can result in large batches of defective goods.

### 东北各公营工厂  推广马恒昌小组经验  根据具体情况重点推行生产改进

　　东北各公营工厂
    推广马恒昌小组经验
    根据具体情况重点推行生产改进
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】著名的东北机械管理局沈阳第五机器厂马恒昌小组的生产经验，已在东北各公营工厂中普遍推广。最近三个月来，这一经验已由沈阳扩展至哈尔滨、长春、安东、锦州、大连等地；并逐渐由重工业部门推广到轻工业部门。目前，沈阳市的机械、电器、化学、纺织、橡胶等工业部门，已出现了四十五个马恒昌式的生产小组。
    一般工厂在推行马恒昌小组的先进经验时，是根据各该厂的具体情况有重点地进行的。东北机械管理局第一机器厂针对过去检查制度松懈造成废品率大的浪费现象，着重推广了马恒昌小组的“先检查头一个产品”的制度。在十四天中，就防止了二十三次废品的产生。轻工业管理局所属第七橡胶工厂，学习了马恒昌小组“利用工余时间举行生产检讨会”和着重解决生产过程中各种技术问题的“技术研究会议”经验后，工人的操作技术即普遍提高。该厂成型间第三小组在十天之内，废品率即由过去的百分之十降低到百分之零点五。辽东省营柞蚕公司第二织绸厂刘金宸小组，过去经常因发生事故影响生产。五月初学习了马恒昌小组的“实行严格的交班制度和技术互助”的经验后，五月份工时损失较四月份减少百分之五十四，不仅保证了全月生产任务的提前完成，而且绸的质量亦超过原定标准的百分之九。
    目前在推广马恒昌小组经验中已发现的主要偏向是：一部分工厂的领导人员，片面地认为马恒昌小组的经验只适于机械工业，因而对推广这一先进经验没有采取积极的态度；或者是不根据本厂的实际情况，机械地搬用其全部制度和办法，结果就流于形式。因此，东北总工会已决定在本月底召开马恒昌式小组的代表会议，交流经验，讨论进一步的推广计划。
    按：马恒昌小组原为沈阳第五机器厂一个模范小组。因为它经常保持产品质量的优良，并提前完成生产任务，曾先后获得该工厂、沈阳市总工会和东北工业部的三面奖旗。该组对解决当前东北工业生产中缺乏责任制和产品质量低等问题，已创造了比较成熟的经验。其主要经验是：（一）建立技术研究会，利用中午休息时间研究分配到该组的生产计划和图纸，研究它的要点和最容易被人马虎处理的地方而加以注意改进。（二）建立技术互助组，解决生产中临时发生的技术问题，不仅对提高学徒和新工人的技术帮助很大，并防止了废品的发生。（三）建立擦洗机器、保管工具、交换班次等明确的分工与负责制度，严守生产纪律，使生产有条不紊。每周并举行一次生产检讨会，发现缺点即迅速改正。（四）实行“先检查头一个产品”的制度，克服了事后检查一次废品就是一大批的浪费现象。
