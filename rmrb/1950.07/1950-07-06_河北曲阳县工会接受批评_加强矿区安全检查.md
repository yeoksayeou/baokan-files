　　Hebei Quyang County Trade Union Accepts Criticism
    Strengthens Safety Inspections in Mining Areas
    [This newspaper, Quyang] Since accepting the criticism from the Hebei Daily on April 21st, the Quyang County Trade Union in Hebei Province has moved to the Ling Shan Town industrial and mining area to strengthen its leadership over the mining areas. It has also established a mine area safety and health inspection committee in conjunction with the Mining Bureau, stipulating an inspection system. In the past month, trade union cadres have gone down into the mines eight times to inspect security work. The Shulin Coal Mine, which had poor safety and health equipment, was inspected three times in a row, and was urged to improve its equipment. As a result, the safety and health equipment of the mines has improved compared to before. In the past month, with the exception of the Xiahe Coal Mine capitalist Sun Fang, who violated specifications in coal mining due to greed for petty profits, resulting in his death and minor injuries to one worker, no other casualties have occurred in the mining area.

　　河北曲阳县工会接受批评
    加强矿区安全检查
    【本报曲阳讯】河北省曲阳县工会自接受河北日报四月二十一日的批评后，为加强对矿区的领导，工会已迁至灵山镇工矿区。并和矿务局结合，建立了矿区安全卫生检查委员会，规定了检查制度。在近一个月来，工会干部已下井八次，检查保安工作。对安全卫生设备较差的树林煤井，曾连续下井检查三次，并督促其改进设备。因此各矿井的安全卫生设备已较前改善。一个月来，除下河煤井资方孙方因贪图小利，违反规格采煤，致遭身死，并轻伤工人一名外，该矿区未发生其他伤亡事故。
