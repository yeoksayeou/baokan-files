　　Lanfeng County, Henan Province, Fu Qingyun and Others Arbitrarily Beat Farmers in Leiji Township, Resulting in Accidental Death; County People's Court Has Imposed Legal Penalties
    To the Editor:
    Fu Qingyun (Communist Party member), Han Bingwen, Miao Nian (Communist Party member), and other cadres of Leiji Township, Zhuaying District, Lanfeng County, Henan Province, were arbitrary and did not follow policies during the land reform work, and threatened the masses with guns, accidentally killing one farmer each, thereby creating a very bad influence among the masses. In Yangzhuang Village in the township, thirteen people were tied up and hung up during the land reform. He did not allow the masses to speak when classifying class status. As a result, many people were wrongly classified. For example, middle peasant Zhang Fuxing was detained for twenty days for no reason, which delayed the summer planting.
    After the land reform was completed, it was discovered that there was a lot of hidden land in some villages. However, the cadres did not conduct in-depth investigations, but only hoped to solve the problem with a written order, and rashly announced that all the land divided in the land reform would be invalidated. At the township peasant representative meeting, these cadres subjectively limited each village to squeezing out all hidden land within three days, and ordered the village cadres to pledge guarantees. Therefore, random beatings and detentions occurred during the squeezing out of hidden land. Zhangzhuang Village concealed more land, and the masses were afraid or unwilling to attend the meeting. Miao Nian then went door-to-door with a gun to force them to attend the meeting. Middle peasant Wen Xiqing was at home sorting grain when the cadres insisted that he was hoarding grain and dragged him to the meeting and beat him. Wen Xiqing's granddaughter (seven years old) was so frightened that she cried and was also beaten. The meeting was in great disorder, and the cadres threatened the masses with guns. Miao Nian was careless and the gun went off, killing the mother of the village peasant association chairman, Jin Yuzhi, and injuring Jin Guohao.
    After this incident occurred, the county leaders immediately sent personnel to deal with it, expressed condolences to the families of the deceased, and provided 800 catties of grain as funeral expenses for the deceased. The injured were treated by the government. Han Bingwen, a cadre who consistently beat, hung, tied, and detained people, was expelled from the Party (approved by the district committee) and sentenced to three years in prison by the People's Court. Miao Nian was also expelled from the Party and sentenced to five years in prison by the People's Court. Fu Qingyun was kept in the county for reflection.

　　兰封县雷集乡傅清云等任意吊打农民造成误杀事件
    县人民法院已予以法律处分编者同志：
    河南省兰封县爪营区雷集乡干部傅清云（中共党员）、韩炳文、苗年（中共党员）等，在土地改革工作中横蛮不讲政策，并以枪威胁群众，误伤毙农民各一人，因而在群众中造成很坏的影响。该乡杨庄村在土改中被捆被吊，被打者达十三人。在划分阶级时，他不准群众说话。结果被划错成份的很多。如中农张富兴无故被押二十天，致耽误了夏种。
    在土地改革结束后，发现某些村庄有不少黑地。但干部不深入调查，只指望用一纸命令去解决问题，并轻率地宣布土地改革中所划分的土地一律作废。在乡农代会上，这几个干部主观地限各村在三天内挤出所有黑地，并令村干部划押保证。因此在挤黑地中产生了乱打乱押的现象。张庄村瞒田较多，群众不敢或不愿去开会。苗年即持枪挨户强迫开会。中农文西庆正在家中收拾粮食，干部硬说他私藏粮食，把他拉到会上打了一顿。文西庆的小孙女（七岁）吓得大哭，也被打了一顿。当时会场秩序大乱，干部就用枪威胁群众。苗年不慎，枪走了火，当场打死村农会长金玉智的母亲，伤了金国毫。
    此事发生后，县领导机关立即派员前往处理，向死者家属进行了慰问，并拿出粮食八百斤作为死者的安葬费。受伤者由政府负责医治。并将一贯打人、吊人、捆人、押人的干部韩炳文开除党籍（经地委批准），并由人民法院判处徒刑三年。苗年亦被开除党籍，并由人民法院判处徒刑五年。傅清云留县反省。
