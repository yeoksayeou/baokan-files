　　Rural Cooperatives in Various Parts of Shanxi Province
    Organize Peddlers to Go to the Countryside in Large Numbers
    Making Buying and Selling Convenient for Members Scattered in the Mountains
    [This newspaper Taiyuan News] Rural cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province are now widely adopting the method of sending peddlers to the countryside to expand the supply and marketing network and serve their members. In more than ten counties, including Wuxiang, Changzi, Xiyang, Yuanqu, Qinyuan, Yangcheng, and Jincheng, cooperatives already have more than 370 peddler's outfits engaged in regular mobile supply and marketing work to facilitate members scattered in mountain villages and hamlets. The twelve peddler's outfits and twenty-four peddlers of the four central village cooperatives in Caofang, Shizhe, Wangcun, and Hongshui in Changzi County accounted for 38% of the total transaction volume of the four cooperatives in April, saving the members 702 labor days. The peddlers of the central cooperatives in Wuxiang, Changzi, and other counties regularly investigate the consumption and production status of the members and help them plan their purchases and sales. The peddlers sent by the cooperatives can generally distribute industrial products according to the needs of the members and collect the agricultural products of the members for sale, so these peddlers are mostly fully loaded when they go out and return fully loaded. The peddlers of the sixty-two village cooperatives in Wuxiang County investigated the supply and marketing volume of the members in the spring plowing in winter. At the beginning of the spring plowing, they organized the supply of agricultural tools and fertilizers to the members, and promoted the sales of the members' grain and mountain products. Two-thirds of the egg purchase contract signed by Yuanqu County Cooperative with Linfen Egg Company in the spring was fulfilled by the peddlers exchanging industrial products with the members, guaranteeing the fulfillment of the contract.

　　山西各地农村合作社
    大量组织货郎下乡
    散居山地社员购销均感方便
    【本报太原讯】山西省各地农村合作社，正大量采用货郎下乡办法，扩大供销网，为社员服务。武乡、长子、昔阳、垣曲、沁源、阳城、晋城等十余县合作社中，已有三百七十余付货郎担子，作经常性的流动供销工作，以便利散居山庄窝铺的社员。长子县草坊、石哲、王村、洪水四个中心村社十二付货郎担子，二十四个货郎，在四月份供销量，即占该四社交易总额的百分之三十八，社员可以节省劳力工七百零二个。武乡、长子等县中心社的货郎，随时调查社员的消费与生产状况，帮助其计划购买与推销的事情。合作社所派出的货郎一般均能按社员需要将工业品配售出去，并将社员的农产品集中起来推销出去，所以这些货郎多是满载出去，满载而归。武乡县六十二个村社的货郎在冬季就调查了春耕中社员的供销量。春耕开始，便有组织地供给社员农具、肥料；推销社员的粮食、山货。垣曲县社春季与临汾蛋品公司签订的收购鸡蛋合同，其中二分之一任务，便由货郎以工业品向社员进行交换，保证了合同的履行。
