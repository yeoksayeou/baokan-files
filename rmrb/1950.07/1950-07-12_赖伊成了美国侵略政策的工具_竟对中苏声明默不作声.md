　　Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Since the United States instigated the South Korean puppet regime to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and then directly carried out armed aggression, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has consistently worked for the American aggressors, helping them greatly undermine the United Nations Charter. Lie has remained silent to this day regarding the solemn statements of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko. In the statement of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko on July 4th and the statement of our Foreign Minister Zhou on July 6th, both pointed out the United States' acts of aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, and pointed out the illegality of the Security Council's resolutions and the serious violation of the United Nations Charter. The above two statements both clearly pointed out that in this series of destructive actions, Lie played a significant role in deepening and expanding them. Lie's actions in the United Nations show that he has become, in effect, a tool of American aggression policy.
　　After the Security Council illegally passed an order on June 25th demanding that the Korean People's Army, which had counter-attacked across the 38th parallel, withdraw to North Korea, Lie abandoned the responsibility of the United Nations Secretary-General to ensure the strict implementation of the United Nations Charter and actively implemented this illegal resolution of the Security Council, which seriously violated the United Nations Charter. In his broadcast on June 26th, Lie even went so far as to clear the way for American armed intervention. He said: "If the United Nations Security Council has troops at its disposal in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, then it can appropriately use these troops when the North Korean regime does not obey the council's ceasefire order."
　　When the United States government announced on June 27th that it was sending troops to Korea and carrying out armed aggression against Taiwan with the Seventh Fleet, while intensifying its intervention in Vietnam and the Philippines, Lie turned a blind eye to this series of aggressive actions that completely violated the United Nations Charter and remained silent. On the evening of the same day, after the Security Council, under the control of the United States, illegally passed the American proposal requiring UN member states to carry out armed intervention in the Korean civil war, Lie, while sending the above illegal resolution to UN member states, abused the authority of the UN Secretary-General and arbitrarily requested in its notification that member states indicate what kind of "assistance" they would provide to "support" the Security Council's illegal "resolution".
　　As of July 3rd, Lie again arbitrarily dispatched Colonel Catesing of South Africa and four observers as his "personal representatives" to South Korea for so-called "direct investigation," and as liaison officers between Lie and the Lee Seung-man puppet regime and the illegal UN "Commission on Korea," in an attempt to find excuses for the American aggressors.
　　Recently, after the Security Council, under the control of the United States, illegally passed on July 7th the so-called "resolution" to form the "United Nations Forces" by stealing the name of the intervention forces of US-British imperialism in Korea, Lie gave complete support to this illegal action that unprecedentedly tarnished the United Nations. Lie held a shameful so-called "flag-giving ceremony," handing the United Nations flag to American representative to the Security Council, Austin.

### 赖伊成了美国侵略政策的工具  竟对中苏声明默不作声

　　赖伊成了美国侵略政策的工具
    竟对中苏声明默不作声
    【新华社十一日讯】自美国策动南朝鲜傀儡政权进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并继之直接武装侵略以来，联合国秘书长赖伊始终为美国侵略者奔走效劳，帮助它大大破坏了联合国宪章。赖伊对于我国周恩来外长和苏联外交部次长葛罗米柯的严正声明，至今默不作声。在七月四日苏联外交部次长葛罗米柯和七月六日我国周外长的声明中，都指出了美国对朝鲜和我国台湾的侵略行为，并指出了安理会决议的非法和严重地破坏联合国宪章。上述两项声明，都明确指出了在这一连串的破坏性的行动中，赖伊显著地起了加深和扩大的作用。赖伊在联合国的行动表明他已实际上成为美国侵略政策的工具。
    在六月二十五日安理会非法地通过要求反攻过三八线的朝鲜人民军撤回北朝鲜的命令后，赖伊背弃了联合国秘书长负有保证严格执行联合国宪章的职责，积极执行安理会这一严重破坏联合国宪章的非法决议。赖伊在六月二十六日的广播中，甚至不惜为美国进行武装干涉扫清道路。他说：“如果联合国安理会依据联合国宪章的规定能有听其支配的军队，那么在北朝鲜政权不服从该会的停战令时，它就可以适当地使用这些部队。”
    当美国政府于六月二十七日宣布出兵朝鲜并以第七舰队对台湾实行武装侵略，同时加紧对越南、菲律宾的干涉以后，赖伊对美国这一连串彻底破坏联合国宪章的侵略行动竟视若无睹，默不作声。而在当日晚间安理会在美国把持下，非法通过要求联合国各会员国武装干涉朝鲜内战的美国提案以后，赖伊在将上项非法决议送达联合国各会员国同时，却又滥用联合国秘书长的职权，在其通知中擅自要求各会员国表明以何种“援助”来“支持”安理会的非法“决议”。
    至七月三日，赖伊又擅自派遣南非的卡特辛上校及四个观察员为其“私人代表”，赴南朝鲜作所谓“直接调查”，并作为赖伊与李承晚傀儡政权及非法的联合国“朝鲜委员会”之间的联系人，企图为美国侵略者寻找借口。
    最近，安理会于七月七日在美国把持下，非法通过以美英帝国主义在朝鲜的干涉军，盗窃名义，组成“联合国军”的所谓“决议”以后，赖伊对这一空前玷污联合国的非法行动，竟予以完全支持。赖伊举行了可耻的所谓“授旗仪式”，将联合国旗授与美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀。
