Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th: The Fujian Provincial Women's Work Conference was held in Fuzhou from June 10th to 29th. The conference summarized the achievements and experiences of women's work in the province over the past four months and established the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Democratic Women's Federation.

Over the past four months, women's federations or women's committees have been established in twenty-eight cities and counties, including Fuzhou and Xiamen. The number of women organized has reached 110,000, of whom over 90% are working women. Women's work in various localities has played a certain role in coordinating the completion of bandit suppression, supporting the front lines, production, and rent reduction. In addition to undertaking most of the field labor, women have actively developed various sideline productions such as tea picking, firewood cutting, mat weaving, bamboo shoot digging, pig raising, and transportation. Women in Jinjiang, Nan'an, Longxi, and other counties have also organized reconnaissance groups to go into the mountains to scout out bandit activities, assisting the troops in bandit suppression. Women boatmen in Changle guided and rowed boats for the bandit suppression troops, helping them to annihilate bandits along the coast. Two women in the He Mountain District of Xiamen mobilized more than 300 sailors and boatmen to sign up to support the front lines and organized more than 1,000 women to participate in stretcher bearing, first aid, sewing, laundry, and other work. Women in the old Soviet areas launched a competition to make military shoes. In three counties, such as Longyan, a total of 62,524 pairs of shoes were made at one time to support the front lines. Women in various places who have been emancipated generally demand to learn culture. Currently, 518 women's study classes have been organized throughout the province, with 23,384 women participating in the study.

The conference adopted the guiding principles and tasks for women's work in Fujian Province in the future, requiring that women's work in the future should focus on rural areas, expand women's organizations in a planned and focused manner, and strive to organize 350,000 to 500,000 women in the province in 1950 to assist the people's government in completing the tasks of suppressing bandits, supporting the front lines, production, preparing for famine, and transforming village political power.

　　福建省举行妇女工作会议
    决定面向农村扩展妇女组织
    四月来全省妇女在劳动生产、支援前线和文化学习等方面有显著成绩
    【新华社福州十二日电】福建省妇女工作会议于六月十日至二十九日在福州举行。会议总结了全省四个月来妇女工作的成绩及经验，并成立了福建省民主妇女联合会筹备委员会。
    四个月来，福州、厦门等二十八个市县先后成立了妇联会或妇委会，已组织起来的妇女达十一万人，其中劳动妇女占百分之九十以上。各地妇女工作在配合完成剿匪、支援前线、生产和减租等工作中都起了一定的作用。妇女们除担负了大部分田野劳动外，更积极开展采茶、砍柴、编席、挖笋、养猪和运输等各种副业生产。晋江、南安、龙溪等县的妇女，并组织侦察小组上山侦察匪情，协助部队进行剿匪工作。长乐女船工替剿匪部队引路、划船，帮助部队歼灭沿海的土匪。厦门禾山区两个妇女共动员了三百余水手、船工报名支援前线，并组织一千余妇女参加担架、救护、缝衣、洗衣等工作。老苏区的妇女开展作军鞋竞赛。如龙岩等三个县，一次做出支援前线的鞋子达六万二千五百二十四双。各地获得翻身的妇女普遍要求学习文化。现全省已组织了妇女学习班五百十八个，参加学习的妇女有二万三千三百八十四人。
    会议通过了福建省今后妇女工作方针和任务，要求今后妇女工作应面向农村，有重点有计划地扩展妇女组织，争取在一九五○年内在全省组织三十五万至五十万妇女，为协助人民政府完成剿匪、支援前线、生产、备荒和改造村政权等工作而斗争。
