　　We must liberate Taiwan!
    Letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu from Air Force Personnel in the Capital

    Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

    We are the Air Force personnel responsible for defending the capital. Since the day our Air Force was born, we have been shouldering the glorious task of defending the capital's airspace under the leadership, cultivation, and education of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Over the past year, we have never forgotten the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people. We stay at the airport every day, and we work as usual on Sundays and holidays. The mechanics, with a high degree of responsibility, check every part of each aircraft to ensure that the engine performs as it should. The fuselage is washed very clean, the machine guns are polished brightly, and the sights are calibrated very accurately, guaranteeing that the aircraft will not fail in any way when performing its mission. The pilots are always ready with all their flight gear, full of energy, and with a tenacious determination. To protect you and the Central People's Government under your leadership, and the safety of the capital, we are always prepared to annihilate any aerial enemy who dares to invade the capital's airspace.

    When the United States once again violated international agreements, undermined peace in the Far East, directly carried out armed intervention in Korea, and continued to infringe on China's territorial sovereignty by obstructing the liberation of Taiwan, this series of aggressive actions has made us more aware of the hideous face of the United States and further heightened our vigilance. We must study harder to improve our political awareness and combat skills. Now that we are growing stronger and stronger, we are fully prepared and determined to participate in coordinating with our army and navy to defeat American aggression, liberate Taiwan, and completely fulfill the great historical task of liberating all of China.

    Respectfully wishing you good health!
            From all the Air Force personnel defending the capital,
            July 26th

　　我们要解放台湾！
    首都人民空军人员上书毛主席朱总司令敬爱的毛主席朱总司令：
    我们是保卫首都的空军人员，自从我们这支空军诞生的那天起，就在中国共产党的领导培养与教育下担负起首都防空的光荣任务。
    这一年来，我们一直没有忘记过党与人民所交给我们的任务，我们整日守在机场，星期天放假日我们也照常工作。机械员同志以高度积极负责的精神检查每一架飞机的各个部分，使发动机发挥了应有的效能。机身洗得很干净，机枪擦得亮亮的，瞄准器校正的非常精确，保证飞机在执行任务时不发生任何故障；飞行员们则随时准备着一切飞行装具，精神饱满，具有着顽强的决心。为保卫您及您所领导下的中央人民政府和首都的安全，我们时刻都准备着把敢于侵入首都的任何空中敌人歼灭在首都上空以外。
    当美国再一次违反国际协议，破坏远东和平，直接武装干涉朝鲜，继续侵犯中国领土主权阻扰台湾的解放，这一连串的侵略行为，使我们更加认清了美国的狰狞面目，更加提高我们的警惕性，我们更要好好地学习提高我们的政治觉悟和战斗技术。现在我们已日益坚强壮大起来，我们有充分准备与决心准备参加配合我们的陆海军击退美国的侵略，解放台湾，彻底完成解放全中国的伟大历史任务。敬祝身体健康！
            保卫首都的全体空军人员同启  七月二十六日
