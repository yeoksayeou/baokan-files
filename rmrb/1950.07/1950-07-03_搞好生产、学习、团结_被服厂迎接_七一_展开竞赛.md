Improve Production, Learning, and Unity
Clothing Factory Launches Competition to Welcome "July 1st"

[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Clothing Factory has decided to greet "July 1st" by completing production tasks ahead of schedule and strengthening learning. The Fourth Branch Factory has launched a production competition, with workshops, groups, and individuals all setting production plans. In the past, the average daily output per person for making hand grenade bags was twenty-three; now, each person is setting a target of making at least twenty-five per day, while ensuring that the quality meets standards. Workers Cai Shaofu and Wang Jingyi have set a plan to make thirty per day, ensuring that 96% require no repairs. The Fourth Branch Factory has been swept up in a production upsurge. Learning has also been given importance. Worker Xiao Chen said: "Only by studying hard can we do a good job in revolutionary work." Correspondent Peng Lanhua said: "From now on, I am determined to study diligently and be a model correspondent." Many people are attending Party classes. In the Tianqiao and Duanfu branch factories, active preparations are underway to celebrate "July 1st" in various ways. At the main factory, every noon and afternoon for more than a month, young waist drum team members have been dancing vigorously on the playground. The Arts Troupe is also rehearsing song and dance dramas, Peking Opera, and more.

[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Fourth Clothing Factory's "July 1st" gift is to strive for further progress in work, learning, and unity and mutual assistance. In terms of work: the factory's current production task is making hand grenade bags. Due to work needs, the Second Factory has been completely relocated, and its production tasks have been entirely transferred to the Fourth Factory. Therefore, each person in the Fourth Factory is now burdened with an average of two more bags per day. To dedicate a gift to "July 1st," everyone unanimously guarantees to complete the tasks on schedule. Currently, workers have been setting personal and group plans and stepping up production. In terms of unity and mutual assistance, workers used to often go to the cooperative to buy things or to the tea stove to drink water during work hours, delaying production. To welcome "July 1st" and promote the spirit of camaraderie, the comrades working in the cooperative have decided to carry goods to each team to sell them; the comrades boiling water at the tea stove are delivering hot water to the workers in large pots. In addition, the Cai Wenfu group, which has always been very united, has launched a unity challenge to all groups. In terms of learning, in the past, few people studied except for Party and Youth League members attending Party and Youth League classes and studying at spare-time schools. Moreover, the public did not participate in the Party classes. Now, many workers have decided to attend Party classes in the future to further understand revolutionary principles.

　　搞好生产、学习、团结
    被服厂迎接“七一”展开竞赛
    【本报讯】北京被服厂决定以提前完成生产任务、加强学习来迎接“七一”。四分厂已展开生产竞赛，车间、小组、个人都订了生产计划。过去作手榴弹袋每天每人平均产量是二十三个，现在每人订出每天至少做二十五个，并且保证质量合乎标准。工人蔡少甫、王景义订的计划是每天作到三十个，保证百分之九十六不修理。四分厂已卷入生产热潮。在学习方面，也已重视起来。工人晓晨说：我们只有好好学习才能搞好革命工作。通讯员彭兰华说：今后我决定用心学习，做一个模范通讯员。有许多群众都参加听党课。在天桥、段府各分厂都在积极准备用各种方式庆祝“七一”。在总厂，一个多月来每天中午、下午，操场上青年腰鼓队员们生龙活虎般的飞舞着。工艺剧团并排演歌舞剧、京剧等。

    【本报讯】北京被服四厂的“七一”献礼是争取在工作、学习、团结互助方面的前进一步。在工作方面：现在全厂生产任务是做手榴弹袋。近因工作需要，二厂已全部迁移，该厂生产任务全部移交。因此四厂每人每天平均多负担两个多。为了“七一”献礼，大家异口同声保证如期完成任务。目前工友已纷纷订出个人和小组计划，加紧生产。在团结互助方面，以前在工作时间内，工友常到合作社去买东西，或到茶炉去喝水，耽误生产。为了迎接“七一”，发挥友爱精神，合作社工作同志决定背着东西到各班来卖；烧茶炉的同志把开水用大壶送到工友面前。此外，一向团结得很好的蔡文甫小组，已向各组发起团结挑战。在学习方面，过去除了党、团员上党、团课和到业余学校学习外，很少有人学习。且党课没有群众参加。现在很多工友都决定今后参加上党课，以进一步了解革命道理。
