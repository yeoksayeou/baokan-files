　　On the "38th Parallel"
    Our newspaper's special correspondent on the Korean front, Li Zhuang
    The "38th Parallel" has become a historical term. The American imperialists once used this line to divide Korea. Their conspiracy has now been shattered by the Korean people. However, the "38th Parallel" will forever remain in the memory of the Korean people. Let the descendants of the Korean people forever remember the American aggression against Korea, and the great achievements of their ancestors in the war of liberation.
    We inspected a very short section of the "38th Parallel," namely, a section of Bicheng County in Hwanghae Province (Bicheng County is on the west coast of Korea). We started from Haeju. Haeju is the capital of Hwanghae Province, with a population of over 72,000. Its southern district is only two or three hundred meters away from the "38th Parallel." Since June 25th, Haeju has been bombed by American planes every day. According to Comrade Gui Dongshan, Secretary of the Hwanghae Provincial Party Committee of the North Korean Workers' Party (equivalent to the provincial party secretary in our country): "The people along the 38th Parallel are very accustomed to the constant attacks by the American puppet Syngman Rhee. They are also accustomed to air raids now. When planes come, everyone hides, and when the planes leave, they continue to work as usual." Indeed, the people north of the "38th Parallel" have suffered too many attacks from Syngman Rhee. From January last year to April this year, Syngman Rhee launched 1,274 attacks north of the line. What we saw this time were only a few traces left by Syngman Rhee's several attacks.
    Traveling thirty-eight li west from Haeju City, we arrived at Cuiye Village, where the Bicheng County People's Committee is located. Some domestic readers already know these two place names (mentioned in the fourth piece of news titled "Korean People's Army Turns to Counter-Offensive" in the People's Daily on June 27th). Cuiye Village is located in a small valley, about ten li north of the "38th Parallel," surrounded by green mountains. Its environment is just like its name. Syngman Rhee took a fancy to this lovely village and occupied it for three days in July last year, but it was later recovered by the North Korean security forces. In the office building of the Bicheng County Party Committee, I saw two three-foot square shell craters, which were caused by Syngman Rhee's flat-trajectory artillery fire during the attack. In the same building, I saw a colorful photo of Chairman Mao. This was the one taken at Tiananmen Square on October 1st last year, when the People's Republic of China was founded. Chairman Mao had a red silk ribbon with the word "Chairman" on his chest and a kind smile. I seemed to see Chairman Mao come to the remote mountain village on the west coast of Korea, kindly and happily concerned about the victory of the Korean people.
    Many of the houses of the farmers in Cuiye Village were destroyed by Syngman Rhee's bandit troops. However, the past days will never return, and the farmers are working hard to rebuild. The original thatched houses are being rebuilt with cement foundations. They worked so hard in the heat that their white clothes were completely soaked with sweat. The Korean farmers are very similar to our country's farmers, hardworking, assiduous, and full of vitality.
    Traveling five li east from Cuiye Village, we arrived at Wufeng Village, seven li north of the "38th Parallel." According to local farmers, at 9:00 a.m. on June 20th, three American planes suddenly flew in from the south and circled for a long time for reconnaissance. Then, Syngman Rhee's bandit troops began shelling. They shelled for several days in a row. We saw the destroyed thatched house of farmer Wu Shixun. On the floor of the wooden Korean-style house, there were two well-sized holes. I really wondered, I really wondered why Syngman Rhee used armor-piercing shells on farmers' thatched houses?
    On a hillside 500 meters north of Wufeng Village, there is a detached house. That is the National Elementary School, which Syngman Rhee's bandit troops chose as their shooting target. On June 24th alone, they fired more than 20 shells at the school, so that the roof and walls were scarred and dilapidated.
    About five li west of Wufeng Village is Longjing Village. The situation west of Longjing Village best illustrates who attacked first. Here is a mountain gully running east-west. On the hillside south of the gully is the position of Syngman Rhee's bandit troops, and on the hillside north of the gully is stationed the security team of the North Korean People's Army. The mountain gully is the "38th Parallel." On the south hillside, the weeds are green and there are no traces of being shot at all. On the north hillside, however, it is a patch of yellow, a patch of scorched black. The shells fired by Syngman Rhee's bandit troops burned all the weeds and shattered the rocks. Two kilometers north of the north hillside, there is a high mountain head called Zhengpo Mountain. In June last year, Syngman Rhee's bandit troops attacked this mountain and were repelled by the security team of the North Korean People's Army. There is now an opera called "Zhengpo Mountain" popular in Korea, which describes the People's Army security team repelling the bandits' attack. The mountain is desolate, and the artemisia is taller than people. In order to protect the lives and safety of the people, the North Korean government advised residents within two or three kilometers north of the line to evacuate, resulting in the abandonment of farmland. Now, many of the wasteland north of the line have been reclaimed and planted with millet, and the seedlings are already two or three inches high. The wasteland south of the line cannot be reclaimed until all the landmines buried by the fleeing bandit troops have been unearthed. At noon, we met a group of farm women returning home from the fields north of the line. They were wearing white shirts, with cloth bags containing the remaining seeds used for sowing on their heads, carrying babies on their backs, and holding bunches of colorful wildflowers in their hands, talking and laughing. The hard-working farmers on the "38th Parallel" can now cultivate freely and quietly.

### “三八”线上

　　“三八”线上
    本报朝鲜战地特派记者  李庄
    “三八线”已经成为历史的名词。美帝国主义者曾经利用这条线分裂朝鲜。它的阴谋，现在，被朝鲜人民粉碎了。但是，“三八线”将永远留在朝鲜人民的记忆里。让朝鲜人民的后代儿孙，永远记住美国对朝鲜的侵略，以及他们祖先在解放战争中的丰功伟绩。
    我们视察了“三八线”很短的一段，即，黄海道碧城县一段（碧城县在朝鲜西海岸上）。我们从海州出发。海州是黄海道的首府，有七万二千余人，它的南市区，距“三八线”仅二、三百公尺。从六月二十五日开始，海州每天遭受美国飞机的轰炸。据北朝鲜劳动党黄海道道党部委员长（相当我国党的省委书记）桂东善同志说：“三八线上的人民，对于美国傀儡李承晚的不断袭击，已经非常习惯了。对于空袭，现在也已经习惯了。飞机临空，大家躲一躲，飞机走了又照常工作。”真的，“三八线”以北的人民，遭受李承晚袭击是太多了。从去年一月至今年四月，李承晚向线北发动了一千二百七十四次的进攻。我们这次所亲眼看到的，只是李承晚几次进攻时留下的一点痕迹。
    从海州市西行三十八里，到翠野村，碧城县人民委员会设于此地。这两个地名，国内读者有些人已经知道了（六月二十七日的人民日报上，题为朝鲜共和国军队转入反攻的第四条新闻中，曾经提到过它）。翠野村座落在一个小小的谷地中，在“三八线”北约十里，周围群山环绕，一片翠绿。它的环境，正象它的名字。李承晚看中了这个可爱的村庄，在去年七月，曾经把它侵占了三天，后来被北朝鲜警备队收复了。在劳动党碧城县党部的办公楼上，我看见两个三尺见方的弹坑，是李承晚进攻时用平射炮打的。在同一所楼上，我看到毛主席的五彩照片。这是去年十月一日，中华人民共和国成立时，在天安门上照的那一张。毛主席胸前挂着写有“主席”字样的红绸条子，笑容可掬。我仿佛看到，毛主席来到偏僻的朝鲜西海岸上的山村中，亲切而愉快地关切着朝鲜人民的胜利。
    翠野村农民的房屋，被李承晚匪军破坏了许多。但是，过去的日子已经不复返了，农民们正在紧张的修建着。原来的草房，改建成洋灰的根基。他们在炎热中这样努力，汗水完全浸透了白色的衣衫。朝鲜的农民很象我国的农民，勤劳、刻苦、富有生命力。
    从翠野村东行五里，到五峰村，在“三八线”北七里处。据当地农民说，六月二十日晨九时，突从南方飞来三架美国飞机，盘旋侦察甚久。接着，李承晚匪军即开始炮击。一连打了好几天。我们看了农民吴世勋的被击毁的草房。在木质的朝鲜式房屋的地面上，有两个井口大的洞。我真奇怪，我真奇怪李承晚为什么对于农民的草房使用了穿甲弹？
    五峰村北五百米处的山坡上，有一所独立房屋。那是国民小学，李承晚匪军把它选为自己的射击目标。他们仅在六月二十四日一天中，就向这学校射击了二十多发炮弹。以致房顶上、墙壁上，弹痕累累，破烂不堪。
    五峰村以西五里许，是龙井村。龙井村西的情况，最能说明是谁先打谁了。这里是一条东西方向的山沟，沟南的山坡上是李承晚匪军的阵地，沟北的山坡上驻着北朝鲜人民军的警备队。山沟就是“三八线”。在南山坡上，野草青青，完全没有被射击的痕迹。而北山坡上，则是一片黄，一片焦黑。李承晚匪军发射的炮弹，烧光了野草，打破了岩石。北山坡以北两千米处，有一座高山头名叫钲坡山，去年六月，李承晚匪军曾进攻此山，被北朝鲜人民军警备队所击退。现在朝鲜流行着一出名叫《钲坡山》的歌剧，描写人民军警备队击退匪军进攻的情形。山上一片荒凉，蒿草比人还高。北朝鲜政府为了保护人民的生命安全，曾劝告线北两三公里以内的居民撤退，结果田地都荒芜了。现在，线北的荒地，有许多已经开垦出来，种上谷子，出苗已两三寸高。线南的荒地，由于匪军逃窜时埋了许多地雷，在没有完全掘出之前，还不能开垦。中午时分，我们在线北遇到一群从田野里回家的农妇，她们穿着白衣衫，头上顶着装着播种剩下的种子用的布袋，背上负着婴儿，手中拿着一丛丛五颜六色的野花，说着笑着。勤苦的“三八线”上的农民，现在可以自由地、安静地耕作了。
