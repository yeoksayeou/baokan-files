    The Beijing Youth Summer Life Committee, in order to promote sports activities in various schools, is preparing to hold various ball games, track and field competitions, and tug-of-war competitions during the summer vacation. The ball games are divided into six groups: men's and women's university, men's and women's high school, and men's and women's junior high school. Male and female students from all middle schools can form teams by school to participate in the competitions in each district. The champion teams from each district and the university teams will participate in the city's competition. The men's group competitions include four items: soccer, basketball, volleyball, and softball; the women's university group includes two items: basketball and volleyball; and the women's high school and junior high school groups include three items: basketball, volleyball, and softball. The district-level competitions will use either a single round-robin system or an elimination system depending on the situation, while the city-level competition will use a single round-robin system.
    In mid-August, track and field competitions will be held in various districts, limited to middle school students. Each unit can have up to four people, and each person can participate in up to two events (excluding relays). Each unit is limited to one relay team. The competition events will follow the items announced by the Beijing People's Sports Games Design Committee (see this newspaper on July 4th). Tug-of-war competitions will also be held in mid-August, with schools competing by district.
