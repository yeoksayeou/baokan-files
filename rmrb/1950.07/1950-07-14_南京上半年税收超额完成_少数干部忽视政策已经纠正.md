Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 10th: Nanjing City has exceeded its tax revenue target for the first half of this year. As of June 30th, tax revenue submitted to the treasury totaled 64.004 billion yuan (excluding land value tax and excess profits tax), equivalent to over 48,265,500 jin of rice, exceeding the original target by 2,071,969 jin.

The main reasons for the above-mentioned achievements in Nanjing's tax work are, first, the tax department's implementation of the Central People's Government's tax policy, its active efforts to organize tax sources in its work, strengthening investigation and research, and timely inspection of the work of its subordinate branches, correcting the idea of some cadres who did not pay attention to urban tax revenue and the laissez-faire phenomenon. For example, after the business tax was reorganized, the daily average income was more than twice that of before. Second, appropriate adjustments were made in personnel allocation and work systems, and work was regularly inspected and supervised from top to bottom; the work system of emphasizing internal work and slighting external work was changed, the allocation of external staff was strengthened, and a fixed-personnel and fixed-quota system was implemented, requiring everyone to complete a certain task within a certain period of time based on tax policies and actual possibilities, which greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of the staff. At the same time, the Tax Bureau simplified tax collection procedures, so that the supplementary tax procedures for more than 5,000 stores were quickly completed in more than 40 days. In addition, the Tax Bureau has held many forums and lectures for the industrial and commercial sectors to explain the state's tax laws, policies, and the significance of people paying taxes. The Tax Bureau held no less than 100 such meetings in April and May, which was very effective. After taxpayers improved their understanding, they actively paid taxes. For example, after the spring business tax was levied, more than 70% of the total was completed within seven days.

Nanjing City still has some serious shortcomings in its tax work. The first is that a few cadres committed acute illness and a simple task-oriented viewpoint, thus ignoring the implementation of policies. For example, individual small handicraft workshops were taxed as shopkeepers, or residences and shops were calculated as the same tax rate for housing donations, and some cadres even taxed commodities that should be tax-free. These phenomena have been corrected after being discovered by the leading organs. The second is that some cadres are not patient enough in their work and impose more penalties than education on taxpayers, thus causing dissatisfaction among some taxpayers. For example, after investigating a household of handmade cigarette rollers for tax evasion, the entire household's means of production and raw materials were confiscated. These were also corrected after being discovered by the leadership.

### 南京上半年税收超额完成  少数干部忽视政策已经纠正

　　南京上半年税收超额完成
    少数干部忽视政策已经纠正
    【新华社南京十日电】南京市今年上半年税收任务已超额完成。截至六月三十日止，缴库税款计六百四十亿零四千多万元（地价税及过份利得税尚未计入），折合大米四千八百二十六万五千余斤，超出原定任务达二百零七万一千九百六十九斤。
    南京市税收工作有上述成绩的主要原因，首先是税务部门贯彻执行中央人民政府的税收政策，并在工作中积极整理税源，加强调查研究，及时检查所属各分局的工作，纠正了部分干部不重视城市税收的思想以及放任自流现象。如行商税经整理后，每天平均收入等于以前的两倍多。其次，在人事配备和工作制度上作了适当的调整，经常由上而下地检查、督促工作；改变了重内轻外的工作制度，加强了外勤力量的配备，并且实行了定员定额制，根据税收政策和实际可能，责成各人在一定时期内完成一定任务，这大大加强了工作人员的责任心。同时，税务局简化了收税手续，使五千多家商店的补税手续在四十多天中很快完成。此外，税务局曾多次召开工商界座谈会、讲演会，解释国家税收法令、政策和说明人民纳税的意义，四、五月份内税务局召开这种会议不下百次，收效很大。纳税人在认识提高后，都踊跃缴纳税款，如春季营业税开征后，七天之内就完成了全数的百分之七十以上。
    南京市在税收工作中仍存在着一些严重的缺点。首先是少数干部犯有急性病和单纯的任务观点，因而忽视了政策的执行。例如把个别小手工业作坊当作座商征税，或把住宅与铺面计作同等税率征收房捐，有些干部甚至把应当免税的商品也收了税。这些现象经领导机关发现后都已经得到纠正。其次是少数干部工作不够耐心，对纳税人处罚多于教育，因而造成部分纳税人的不满。如查出一个手工卷烟户漏税，竟没收该户全部生财及原料，这些亦经领导上发觉后纠正。
