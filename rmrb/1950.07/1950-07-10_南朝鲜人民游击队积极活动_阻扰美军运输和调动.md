Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th - The Korean Central News Agency reports: In coordination with the victorious operations of the People's Army, the South Korean People's Guerrillas, with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, are actively carrying out activities behind enemy lines to obstruct the transportation of weapons and the movement of troops by the American aggressors. Guerrillas operating around Mt. Sobaek have destroyed important enemy roads and bridges in the Chupung Pass area where Gyeongsangbuk-do and Chungcheongbuk-do meet. Guerrillas in the Daegu area of Gyeongsangbuk-do, with the assistance of nearby residents, destroyed the main roads near Waegwan, Gomo, and Gyeongsan, greatly hindering the transportation of US military weapons. The East Coast Guerrilla Unit, operating in the Yangsan and Gijang areas of Gyeongsangnam-do, disregarding the intense enemy and puppet gunfire, continuously destroyed the main roads and bridges around Busan, greatly increasing the difficulty of transporting US military supplies landed at the port of Busan and moving US troops to the front lines.

The Jirisan Guerrilla Unit's bold activities in Suncheon, Gwangyang and other places in Jeollanam-do have brought the enemy and puppet troops to a standstill. The guerrillas not only actively destroy enemy roads and bridges, but also constantly carry out propaganda and mobilization work among residents in various places, calling on residents to use various methods to prevent US weapons from being transported north and to refuse the puppet military police's forced mobilization to repair roads and bridges.

　　南朝鲜人民游击队积极活动   阻扰美军运输和调动
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜中央通讯社讯：配合人民军的胜利作战的南朝鲜人民游击队，在广大人民的热烈支持下，在敌后积极展开活动，阻扰美国侵略者的武器运输与部队调动。活动在小白山周围的游击队，在庆尚北道与忠清北道交界的秋风岭方面，破坏了敌人的重要道路与桥梁。庆尚北道大邱方面的游击队，在附近居民的协助下，将倭馆、顾母、庆山三地附近的主要道路破坏，使美军武器的输送，大感困难。在庆尚南道梁山、机张一带活动的东海岸游击队，不顾敌伪炮火的猛烈射击，将釜山周围的主要道路桥梁连续破坏，使从釜山港登陆的美国军需品的运送与美军部队的前线调动增加了巨大的困难。
    智异山游击队在全罗南道顺天、光阳等地的果敢活动，已使敌伪军陷于无法行动的境地。游击队不仅积极破坏敌人的道路桥梁，同时还不断向各地居民进行宣传动员工作，号召居民用各种方法阻止美国武器北运，拒绝傀儡军警强迫动员修复道路和桥梁。
