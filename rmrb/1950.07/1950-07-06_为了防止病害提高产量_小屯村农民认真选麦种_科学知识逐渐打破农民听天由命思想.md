　　To Prevent Disease and Increase Production,
    Xiaotun Village Farmers Carefully Select Wheat Seeds
    Scientific Knowledge Gradually Overcomes Farmers' Fatalistic Ideas
    [Our Newspaper] After the working group of Xiaotun Village in the Fifteenth District was assigned the task of summer harvest seed selection by the District Committee, they formed a seed selection committee with students from the Agricultural University Farm to promote the work of seed selection. Through repeated publicity, explanation, and mobilization, the seed selection work was successfully completed in thirteen days, ensuring that 11,071 mu of wheat land would be planted with good wheat seeds next year. Initially, when the working group and the students from the Agricultural University convened the production guidance committees of each village to study this work, some village cadres lacked confidence in seed selection, and their reliance on heaven for food was very strong. At that time, the saying "This year is a natural disaster year, and no wheat will be harvested" and "No one can overcome God" was circulating among the farmers. In order to break through this obstacle, the working group and the students from the Agricultural University took the village cadres and farmers to the farm to visit the wheat that was growing well, and brought microscopes to each village to allow the farmers to observe the diseases themselves. At the same time, they organized propaganda teams to perform street plays and sing fast-clapper rhymes to vigorously promote seed selection. The farmers saw through the microscope that countless small white worms were swimming in the whites of "Malianzi" wheat, along with countless white eggs, and that wheat suffering from jaundice looked like dry sores on people's thighs. In this way, the farmers understood the ideas, and they knew that wheat disasters were related to seed selection, understood the sources of diseases such as black jaundice, nematodes, and Malianzi, improved the farmers' scientific knowledge, and transformed the superstitious ideas of relying on heaven for thousands of years.
    The leading role of party members and cadres played a good role in seed selection. They guaranteed "separate harvesting, separate threshing, and separate storage" for their selected wheat seeds, and would never mix them with miscellaneous wheat, and welcomed farmers without good wheat seeds to exchange them; in this way, a seed selection craze was quickly set off among the farmers. At present, the selected wheat seeds include Bazhou White, Guangtou White, Xiaohongwang, and Baiwang, totaling twelve qing ninety-one mu and two fen in seven villages. According to experienced farmers, if the climate is still like this year next year, these wheat seeds will definitely produce three or four more dou per mu than this year.

　　为了防止病害提高产量
    小屯村农民认真选麦种
    科学知识逐渐打破农民听天由命思想
    【本报讯】十五区小屯村工作组在区委布置夏收选种工作之后，就与农大农场的同学组成选种委员会，推动选种工作。他们通过反复宣传、解释、动员，在十三天中，选种工作即胜利完成，保证了明年一万一千零七十一亩麦地种上一色的好麦子。最初工作组与农大同学召集各村的生产指导委员会，研究这一工作时，某些村干部都对选种没信心，靠天吃饭的思想非常浓厚。当时农民中流传着：“今年是天年不收麦”、“谁也拧不过老天爷”等等说法。工作组与农大同学为了打破这一障碍，就带着村干部与农民到农场去参观长得好的麦子，并带着显微镜到各村让农民亲自观察病害。同时又组织了宣传队，演街头小剧、唱快板，大力宣传选种。农民从显微镜中看到“马连籽”麦子的白水中，游泳着无数小白虫，和无数的白蛋蛋，生黄疸病的麦子就像人大腿上生了干疮一样。这样农民搞通了思想，他们知道了麦子生灾与选种是有关系的，明白了黑疸、线虫、马连籽等病的来源，提高了农民们的科学知识，转变了数千年来听天由命的迷信思想。
    党员干部的带头，对选种工作起了良好作用。他们对自己被选上的麦种，保证“单割、单打、单仓”，决不与杂麦混合，并欢迎没好麦种的农民来换；这样很快地在农民中掀起了选种热潮。目前选出的麦种有灞州白、光头白、小红王、白王四种，七个村子共选地十二顷九十一亩二分。据有经验的农民说：明年如果仍像今年的气候，这些麦种一定能比今年每亩多产三、四斗。
