　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: TASS, New York, 22nd: Trygve Lie's efforts to appeal to the member states of the United Nations to provide ground forces to support the United States' aggression against Korea have so far clearly met with complete failure. The New York Times stated: United Nations officials admit that so far, no member state has suggested providing troops. Compass reporter Elder reported: Trygve Lie's "embarrassed spokesman" admitted that Trygve Lie has not yet received specific suggestions from any country. The reporter continued: According to existing news, Argentina, Egypt, Denmark, and the Netherlands have rejected Trygve Lie's appeal, although the Dutch spokesman refused to confirm or deny these reports.

　　赖伊为美搜罗炮灰已经遭到彻底失败
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：赖伊呼吁联合国各会员国供给地面部队借以支持美国侵略朝鲜的努力，迄今显然已遭到彻底失败。纽约时报称：联合国官员们承认，迄今为止，没有一个会员国建议供给部队。指南针日报记者埃德尔报道：赖伊的“窘迫不堪的发言人”承认：赖伊尚未从任何国家获得具体的建议。该记者继称：据现有消息，阿根廷、埃及、丹麦和荷兰已拒绝赖伊的呼吁，虽然荷兰的发言人对这些消息拒绝加以证实或否认。
