Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 5th: After the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" was published in newspapers here, people from all walks of life in Xi'an and Chang'an County expressed their warm support. Du Yanqing, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, said on behalf of the 500,000 workers in the entire Northwest: We are willing to work closely with our peasant brothers to eliminate all obstacles to the implementation of the Land Reform Law in the Northwest and jointly complete this great historical task. Only when the peasants are liberated, the rural productive forces are liberated, can industry and commerce develop, and the worker-peasant alliance be consolidated. Chen Bailin, a poor peasant from the four townships in Weiqu District, Chang'an County, said happily after reading the Land Reform Law: "The big rock that has been weighing on our heads for thousands of years is finally being removed." He approved of the provisions in the Land Reform Law for preserving the rich peasant economy, saying, "This is good for developing production."
