　　Liu Jingyuan of the Tram Repair Factory Donates More Than 300 Pieces of Equipment

　　[This newspaper reported] Liu Jingyuan, of the Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory, on June 29th, voluntarily donated more than 300 pieces of equipment, valued at over one million yuan, as a gift to welcome "July 1st" and to support the factory's launch of the New Record Movement.

　　Liu Jingyuan is the father of Liu Mengxing, who continuously creates and improves tools, and is a veteran technical worker in the repair factory. Since returning to the factory from the Municipal Party Committee training class, he has become more concerned about the factory's production. He improved the method of drilling holes, and studied the tool of screw tap with milling cutter, which reduced the efficiency of drilling motor skin holes from eight work hours to two point six work hours. He is also preparing to contribute more of his wisdom and strength. He said, "Today the factory is our own, so we must find ways to make it better."

　　On June 28th, on his way home from work, he heard his fellow worker Xie Jingming talking about: "The characters used for marking the rollers are too short, and if you are not careful, you will hit your hand. Today I hit my hand again. Buying new characters is both expensive and difficult." Old Liu thought, "I still have a set of Western characters at home, I'll send them to the factory tomorrow!" He has many tools at home, and most of them are difficult to buy on the market now. When Liu Jingyuan turned out the box of stored tools and saw these tools, he thought: "'July 1st' is the birthday of our working class party, and the factory is about to launch a new record movement, and these tools are what the factory lacks the most, why not donate them to the factory to make the innovation record movement better?" After repeated consideration, the next morning, he handed over these 300 pieces of tools that the factory urgently needed, such as English type, American-made small drill bits, tiny twist drills smaller than one-tenth of an inch, small hammers, small thin grinding wheels, etc., to the union, and donated them to the factory. His actions were highly praised by the union. At the company's award ceremony on June 30th, he was awarded a medal and 500 kilograms of millet.

　　电车修造厂刘景垣献出器材三百余件
    【本报讯】京电车公司修造厂刘景垣，于六月二十九日，自动献交价值一百余万元的三百多件器材，作为迎接“七一”及对该厂开展新纪录运动的献礼。
    刘景垣是连续创造、改进工具者刘梦星的父亲，是修造厂的老技术工人。他自市委训练班学习回厂后，就更加关心工厂的生产。他改进了钻眼的方法，研究了螺丝绞刀带铣刀的工具，使钻马达皮眼的效率由八个工减至二点六工，他还在准备着更多地贡献出自己的智慧与力量。他说：“今天厂子是咱自己的，就要想法把他搞好。”
    六月二十八日他下班回家，在路上听到工友解景明谈起：“打滚子号用的字头太短了，不留神就打在手上，今天又把手打了一下，要买新字头，又贵又难买到。”老刘想：“家里还存有一付西洋字头，明天送给厂中吧！”他家里有很多工具，而且多是现在市上很难买到的。当刘景垣翻出存家伙的箱子看到了这些工具后，心想：“‘七一’是咱们工人阶级政党的生日，厂里又要展开新纪录运动，而这些工具都是厂中最缺乏的，为什么不献给厂里，使创新纪录运动更好的展开呢？”经过反复考虑后，第二天清早，他就把这些厂里迫切需要的英文字头、美制小钻仓、不到一分细的小麻花钻小锤子、小薄砂轮等等工具三百余件，一起交给工会，献给了工厂。他这种举动，受到了工会的极大表扬。六月三十日公司给奖大会上，奖给他奖章一枚、小米五百斤。
