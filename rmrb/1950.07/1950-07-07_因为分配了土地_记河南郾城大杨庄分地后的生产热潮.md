Because the Land Was Distributed
——Record of the Production Upsurge After Land Distribution in Dayangzhuang, Yancheng, Henan
Mu Qing

“Because we have land…”

Dayangzhuang, in Yancheng County, Henan, is a large village of more than 300 households. Land distribution was completed in early May this year, but when I passed through here in mid-June, the whole village was actively engaged in production, everyone was working, and a new scene had already emerged.

Those days were the most intense season for summer planting. Due to drought and no rain, farmers were carrying water to plant. The Tulu River is located to the southwest of the village, normally with a strong current, but now many places have exposed sandy bottoms. Every morning and evening, looking along the banks of this shallow river, people carrying water for planting were running everywhere in the river and in the fields. Almost all the male and female labor force in Dayangzhuang participated in this arduous labor. They used buckets, jars, and even washbasins to draw water from the river and deliver it to the distant fields, often two or three *li* back and forth. For fields even further away, they used carts to carry four or five water tanks, carefully delivering them, taking at least one or two hours for a round trip. And each bucket of water could only water about six sweet potato seedlings, with the highest record per person per day being only about 300 seedlings. But the farmers were not discouraged, and their morale to fight the drought remained high. Especially the young farmers, who seemed even more active. While working, they were always singing and shouting. I once asked a female youth league member, "How many loads of water can you carry in a day?" She said, "Roll up my trousers, and I can carry as many loads as the men."

In previous years, when faced with such a drought, farmers could only sigh at the sun or would have already joined forces with several villages to "kneel down" and pray for rain, but this year there were none of these phenomena. Many farmers said: This is because we have land, and we can't let the land be delayed.

“So many brand-new carts!”

Morning in Dayangzhuang is the most lively time of the day. The farmers all eat early in the morning. Some lead livestock, and some push carts out of the newly built sheds. After a period of busyness, they all go down to the fields. If you stand at the entrance of the village at this time, you can see groups of livestock and carts, fully loaded with manure, farm tools, water tanks, water buckets, etc., passing in front of you one after another, and you will discover: "So many brand-new carts!"

Many livestock and many new carts are indeed a feature of this year's production in Dayangzhuang. According to statistics, the village currently has sixty-four carts, of which thirty-nine were newly built by the farmers during or after the distribution of land. During the same period, the number of livestock also increased by two-fifths. Poor peasants who had no livestock and no carts in the past have now bought livestock and carts, either individually or in partnership. Some people borrowed money to buy them, saying, "Everything grows from the soil; it will grow out after the autumn harvest."

Mutual Aid Groups, Universal Throughout the Village

Another feature of production in Dayangzhuang is that every household in the village participates in mutual aid groups, with almost no one outside a group. These mutual aid groups are all organized by the farmers themselves, with a group consisting of three or four households, or as many as seven or eight, including all classes in the countryside. The content of these groups is mainly the joint use of livestock and carts. When working, they only take turns delivering food, without calculating work points, basically still in the old form. There are many unequal exchanges that need to be improved and enhanced. Even so, it is still much stronger than working separately. In the past, the village had this form of mutual aid, and some groups lasted for years without disbanding, but it was not as widespread as this year. The reason is that in the past, not many poor peasants had land and livestock, but this year they have been allocated land and bought livestock, and they must organize themselves to produce well. I once visited a mutual aid group of poor peasants. This group consisted of six households with a total of six laborers. Before the land distribution, these six households had a total of 6.4 *mu* of land, no livestock, and no carts. Many people could only rely on carrying loads and working as laborers to make a living. Now these six households have been allocated more than 44 *mu* of land in total, and they have jointly bought a cart and two livestock, and added more than 20 pieces of farm equipment. They are now producing very enthusiastically. The whole village of more than 300 households has formed nearly 80 mutual aid groups. Every morning, you call me, I call you, a chorus of voices inviting each other to go to the fields, which is really exciting to see.

“Our carpenters are almost exhausted!”

Dayangzhuang has one blacksmith and five carpenters, who have been incredibly busy before and after the land distribution. The blacksmith Zhang Huaizhi used to have to go outside to do odd jobs for a few months because business was not very good. This year is completely different. The furnace fire has never been extinguished for a single day, and the master and his apprentices work from morning to night, with the clanging sound never stopping. In the past, they would only go to the market to buy some raw materials once every one or two months, but now they have to go every eight or ten days. Even now, almost every day someone comes to him: "Hey, Old Zhang, make me a hoe!"

The five carpenters have worked together to make three new carts from the time of the land distribution until now. The fourth one was just finished, and they were too tired to continue. Customers often go to them, but often cannot order goods. Having no other choice, they had to go to Linying and Xuchang to buy them. Not long ago, a drought appeared in the Yancheng area, and reporters saw the carpenters rushing to make buckets, surrounded by wood chips all day long. Farmers did not dare to bother them to make wooden shovels or fork handles. People often heard others say: "Go to another village to do it, our carpenters are almost exhausted."

Six Landlord Households, Labor Reform

The six landlord households in Dayangzhuang participated in labor production after the distribution of land, in order to transform themselves into new people through labor. Because they understood the government's policies and were allocated the same amount of land as the farmers, they have taken out some of their basic assets and floating wealth to develop production. Since the land distribution, they have bought a total of three livestock, two carts, and added twenty or thirty pieces of farm equipment. The son of the landlord Yang Youchen and Yang Huatang used to be young intellectuals who never knew how to work. Now they are also carrying water, weeding, and planting sweet potatoes in the fields with their backs bare, just like the farmers. The landlords and the women and children of the landlord families are also collecting manure and going to the fields to work. Because they are all willing to work, the farmers are willing to help them and engage in mutual aid with them. Now, all six landlord families have joined mutual aid groups and are producing together with the middle and poor peasants.

When I left Dayangzhuang, the sky was gloomy, and the farmers had already prepared their farm tools and seeds, waiting for a thorough rain. Some farming families have begun to learn to make production plans, and young people are even more looking forward to joining the Youth League through production labor. The idea of building a family through labor and building the country through production has been widely accepted here and has begun to be implemented, with no idle people in the whole village.

Xinhua News Agency. On the road as the reporter left Dayangzhuang, the rain did indeed start to fall. I thought, closely following this rain, I don't know how happily the farmers of Dayangzhuang would desperately produce.

　　因为分配了土地
    ——记河南郾城大杨庄分地后的生产热潮
    穆青
   “因为咱们有了地……”
    河南郾城县的大杨庄，是一个三百多户的大村，今年五月初才分完土地，可是，六月中旬，当我从这里经过时，全村农民积极生产，人人劳动，已经呈现了一片新的景象。
    那几天正是夏种最紧张的季节。由于天旱无雨，农民们都在挑水点种。该村西南面紧靠着土芦河，平常水势很大，现在很多地方都露出了沙底。每天早晨和傍晚，沿着这条浅河的两岸望过去，河里、田野上，到处都奔跑着挑水点种的人群。大杨庄所有的男女劳动力，几乎全部参加了这一艰巨的劳动。他们用水桶、用罐子甚至用脸盆从河里打出水来，一直送到很远的地里去，往往来回就有两三里路。有些地更远的就用大车拉着四五个水缸，一路小心地送过去，至少要一两个钟头才能来回一趟。而每一桶水仅仅能浇种六棵红薯，每人一天的最高纪录也不过点种三百棵左右。但是农民们并没有因此气馁，和旱象作战的情绪，始终饱满。特别是那些青年农民们，显得更加活跃。他们一面劳动，一面总是唱着嚷着。我曾经问过一个女青年团员：“你一天能挑几挑水？”她说：“裤腿一卷，一挑也不比男的少。”
    在往年遇到这种旱天，农民们只有望着太阳叹气，或者早已几个村联合起来“下马子”求雨了，但今年却没有这些现象。很多农民说：这是因为咱们有了地，谁也不能让地耽误了。
    “好多崭新的大车呀！”
    大杨庄的早晨，是一天当中最热闹的时候。农民们一清早都吃了饭。有的牵牲口，有的从新盖的车棚里把大车推出来。忙碌一阵之后，便统统下地去了。如果这时候你站在寨门口，便可以看到成群结队的牲口和大车，满拉着粪土、农具、水缸、水桶等陆陆续续地从你的面前经过，你就会发现：“好多崭新的大车呀！”
    牲口多，新车多，的确是大杨庄今年生产中的一个特点。据统计，全村现有六十四辆大车，其中有三十九辆，是农民们在分配土地当中或分配土地之后打造的新车。在同一时期内，牲口也增加了五分之二。过去没有牲口没有大车的贫农，现在或单独或与人合伙都买了牲口，买了大车。有些人是借钱买来的，他们说：“万物土里生，秋后就长出来了。”
    互助搿犋、普遍全村
    大杨庄生产中还有一个特点：就是全村家家参加犋组，几乎没有一家不在组的。这种互助组全都是农民自动组织起来的，一组少则三四家，多则七八家，包括了农村中的各个阶层。这种组的内容主要是伙用牲口和大车。做活时只是轮流送饭，并不计工算账，基本上还是一种旧有的形式，其中有许多不等价交换的地方还需要改进和提高。虽然如此，但较分散干活仍然强得多。往年该村曾有这种互助形式，而且有常年不散伙的，但却没有今年这样普遍。原因是过去贫农有地有牲口的人不多，而今年却分了地，买了牲口，必需组织起来才能很好生产。我曾访问了一个贫农的搿犋组，这个组由六户农民组成，共有六个劳动力。分地之前这六户农民共有地六亩四，没有牲口更没有大车，很多人只有靠着扛活帮工吃饭。现在这六家一共分到了四十四亩多地，合伙买了一辆车和两匹牲口，还添了二十多件农具。他们现在生产得非常起劲。全村三百多户，一共组成了将近八十个互助组，每到早晨，你喊我，我叫你，一片相邀下地的声音，看来实在令人兴奋。
    “咱们的木匠都快累死啦！”
    大杨庄有一个铁匠，五个木匠，在分地前后简直忙得不可开交。铁匠张怀之往年由于生意不太好，总要到外面混几个月做点零活。今年完全不同了，炉火从来没有熄灭过一天，师徒三人从早打到晚，叮叮当当的声音也不曾间断过。过去一月两月才去赶回集买些原料，现在十天八天就得跑一回。直到现在，差不多每天还有人找他：“喂，老张给我打张锄吧！”
    五个木匠从分地到现在，拼着命合伙打了三辆新大车。第四辆刚打成，累的再也做不下去了。主顾们常常去找他们，但常常订不上货。弄得没法，只好到临颍、许昌去买。不久以前郾城一带呈现旱象，记者看到木匠们正赶着做水桶，一天到晚被木片包围着，农民们想做些木掀、叉把，也不敢去麻烦他们。常听见有人说：“上外村去做吧，咱们的木匠都快累死啦。”
    六户地主、劳动改造
    大杨庄的六户地主，分配土地后，都参加了劳动生产，以便在劳动中改造成为新人。由于了解了政府的政策，又分得了和农民同样一份土地，他们已拿出了一些底产和浮财来发展生产。自分地至今，他们共买了三头牲口，两辆大车，添置了二三十件农具。地主杨又宸和杨化堂的儿子，过去都是小知识分子，从来不知道干活劳动，现在也和农民一样光着脊背在地里挑水拔草、压红薯。地主和地主家的妇女儿童们也都拾粪和下地干活。因他们都还肯干，因此，农民们也就愿意帮助他们，与他们互助变工。现在，六家地主全部参加了搿犋互助组，和中、贫农们在一起生产。
    当我离开大杨庄的时候，天正阴沉着，农民们早已准备好农具种籽，等待着一场透雨。有些农家已开始学着做生产计划，年青人更期待着在生产劳动中争取入团。劳动发家、生产建国的思想，在这里已经被普遍接受，并开始做到了全村无一闲人。
    在记者离开大杨庄的路上，雨果然下起来了。我想，紧跟着这场雨之后，大杨庄的农民们，不知要怎样欢天喜地地拼命生产呢。
