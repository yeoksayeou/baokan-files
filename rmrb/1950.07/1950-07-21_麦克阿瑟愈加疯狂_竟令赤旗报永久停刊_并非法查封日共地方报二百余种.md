Xinhua News Agency, 20th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo: After MacArthur unreasonably ordered the Japanese Communist Party's organ, the Red Flag newspaper, to cease publication for thirty days on June 26th, he again ordered the Yoshida government of Japan on July 18th to suspend "indefinitely" the publication of the Red Flag newspaper and so-called "newspapers and periodicals inheriting and belonging to it that disseminate communist propaganda."

Under MacArthur's instructions, the special investigation bureau, a special agency of the Ministry of Justice of the Yoshida government, had already begun a large-scale closure of Japanese Communist Party local newspapers as early as the 17th. According to Kyodo News and Associated Press reports, the special investigation bureau, with the support of police throughout the country, searched local branches of the Communist Party on the morning of the 17th, confiscated many progressive publications, and ordered 229 branch newspapers distributed in Osaka, Kobe, Aichi, and other places to cease publication. The next morning, the bureau, together with the police, surrounded and searched 26 Communist Party branches in Tokyo, confiscated their published organ newspapers, and ordered them to cease publication. According to the Associated Press, of the 1,009 Japanese Communist Party publications registered with the Ministry of Justice, 539 had been unreasonably banned by the evening of the 18th.

　　麦克阿瑟愈加疯狂
    竟令赤旗报永久停刊           
    并非法查封日共地方报二百余种
    【新华社二十日讯】据美联社东京讯：麦克阿瑟于六月二十六日无理勒令日本共产党机关报赤旗报停刊三十天后，又于七月十八日命令日本的吉田政府“无限期地”停止赤旗报以及所谓“散布共产党宣传的继承该报与属于该报的报刊”出版。
    在麦克阿瑟的指使下，吉田政府法务府的特务机构特别审查局早在十七日就已开始大规模闭封日共地方报纸。据共同社与美联社讯，特别审查局在全国各地警察的支援下，于十七日上午搜查共产党各地支部，没收了许多进步刊物，并勒令分布在大阪、神户、爱知等地的各支部机关报二百二十九种停止发行。次晨，该局又会同警察围抄东京市内二十六个共产党支部，没收它们出版的机关报，并勒令停刊。据美联社讯，在法务府登记过的一千零九种日共刊物中，截至十八日晚为止，已有五百三十九种被无理禁止。
