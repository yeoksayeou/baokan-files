　　On the Signature Front Lines
　　Qun
　　The signature campaign to defend world peace is unfolding further across the country. People from all walks of life are not only actively signing the peace declaration but also collectively or individually writing down their opinions. From here, we hear the magnificent voice of the Chinese people resolutely defending world peace, and from here, we see the Chinese people full of victorious confidence in winning world peace.

　　All employees of Yian Station under the Taiyuan Railway Administration wrote on the signature book: "We are determined to join hands with peace advocates to stop the new war being created by the United States-led imperialism and strive to build a new China." A group of coal yard workers in Qinhuangdao wrote: "What we need is democratic peace, and we resolutely oppose wars of aggression." The employees of the Processing Plant of the Central People's Government Supply Bureau said: "All of our employees firmly oppose the imperialists who use atomic weapons and wage wars of aggression. We will definitely devote all our strength to defending world peace." All employees of a private Yuhua Xing Weaving and Dyeing Factory said: "In our private factory, we must develop production and thoroughly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. To build a new China and for the lasting peace of the world, we will definitely do our best."

　　Many commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, veterans, and military dependents wrote their solemn appeals after signing. A soldier named Zhang Ming said: "Signing a name is like stabbing a bayonet through the heart of a war-monger." Li Bing said: "War-mongers: graves are dug everywhere for you, do you dare to take the risk!" Wang Chunbang and 17 other soldiers wrote: "We are soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, resolutely support the great call, and resolutely oppose the aggressive war policy led by US imperialism. If this group of devils dares to launch a sinful war of aggression, we will fight resolutely until this group of war criminals is completely eliminated." Military dependents Chen Rang and Peng Boying wrote in the signature book: "If anyone dares to launch a war of aggression, even though I am old, I will order my daughter to take up arms and resolutely defend world peace. I hereby solemnly sign and declare my determination." Students of the Third Veterans School in Shanxi Province said: "If this group of demons dares to risk launching a war of aggression, we are willing to contribute our incomplete bodies left over from the war to oppose wars of aggression and strive for lasting world peace."

　　Women expressed their boundless hatred for wars of aggression. Zhang Zixiu wrote: "I want peace, I want my husband, I want my lovely children. Atomic bombs are cruel weapons that should be banned immediately." After signing, housewife Zhang Jing put forward her request: "All mothers in China should execute the will of their children and sign the peace declaration on behalf of their children." Housewife Li Zhang led her whole family to sign, and also wrote her wishes: "Our family is determined to use all our strength to fight for world peace."

　　The vast urban residents also issued a call to defend world peace. Zhang Yaozong wrote: "If a dog is cornered and wants to jump over the wall, I will definitely participate in the struggle to kill the dog." Zhang Guanying wrote: "If a mad dog dares to bite, we will resolutely kill it!" Zheng Xiu Ru wrote: "For the future masters of our country – the next generation of children – we resolutely oppose war provocateurs using atomic weapons." Jiang Wenhao and 13 others wrote: "We are willing to use all our strength to defend world peace, completely smash the aggressive schemes of the imperialists, let the doves of freedom fly in the sky, and let the kind people be active on the earth."

　　Let the war-mongers tremble in the face of the powerful calls of the Chinese people and the people of the world! Let the war-mongers' aggression plans be submerged in the peace wave of the Chinese people and the people of the world!

　　在签名战线上
    群
    保卫世界和平的签名运动，正在全国各地进一步展开，各界人民不但踊跃地在和平宣言上签名，而且集体地或个别地写出了他们或她们的意见，从这里听到了中国人民坚决保卫世界和平的雄壮声音，从这里看出了中国人民充满着赢得世界和平的胜利信心。
    太原铁路管理局义安站全体职工，在签名册上写着：“我们坚决要与和平拥护者携手，制止以美国为首的帝国主义正在制造中的新战争，并为建设新中国而奋斗。”秦皇岛一群煤厂职工写着：“我们需要的是民主和平，我们坚决反对侵略战争。”中央人民政府供应局加工厂的职工说：“我们全体职工坚决反对使用原子武器及进行侵略战争的帝国主义者，我们一定拿出全部力量，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。”一家私营的裕华兴织染厂的全体职工说：“在我们私营工厂中，一定要发展生产，彻底执行劳资两利的政策，为了建设新中国，为了世界的持久和平，我们一定尽我们能尽的一分力量。”
    许多人民解放军的指战员、荣誉军人和军属，在签名后写出了他们的庄严呼声。一位军人张明说：“签一个名，等于一刺刀刺透战争贩子的心窝。”力兵说：“战争贩子们：到处都掘有你们的坟墓，你敢冒险！”王春邦等十七名战士写着：“我们是人民解放军的战士，坚决拥护和大号召，坚决反对以美帝为首的侵略战争政策，如这批魔王敢于发动罪恶的侵略战争，我们将坚决的战斗，直到这批战犯彻底被消灭为止。”军属陈让、彭伯英在签名册上写着：“如果任何人胆敢发动侵略战争，我虽年老，必将命我的女儿也拿起武器，坚决保卫世界和平，特此郑重签名并申明决心。”山西省的第三荣誉军人学校的学员说：“假如这批恶魔敢冒险发动侵略战争，我们愿把战争中留下来的残缺不全的身体，贡献给反对侵略战争，争取世界永久和平。”
    妇女们表示了对侵略战争的无比憎恨。张子绣写着：“我要和平，我要我的丈夫，我要我可爱的孩子，原子弹那是惨忍的武器，应当立即禁止使用。”家庭妇女张敬在签名后提出了她的要求：“全中国的母亲们，应该代自己的孩子执行他们的意志，在和平宣言上替孩子们签名。”家庭主妇李张氏率领全家老小都签了名，并且还写着她的意愿：“我们一家老少决心用全部力量，为世界和平而奋斗。”
    广大的城市居民同样发出了保卫世界和平的呼声。张耀宗写道：“如果狗急要跳墙，我一定参加把狗打死的斗争。”张冠英写道：“如果疯狗敢咬人，我们就坚决打死它！”郑秀如写道：“为了我国未来的主人翁——下一代的儿童，我们坚决反对战争挑拨者使用原子武器。”姜文浩等十三人写道：“我们愿意以全部力量保卫世界的和平，彻底粉碎帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，让自由的鸽子飞翔在天空，让善良的人们活跃在大地。”
    让战争贩子在中国人民和世界人民强大的呼声面前发抖！让战争贩子的侵略计划在中国人民和全世界人民的和平浪潮中淹没！
