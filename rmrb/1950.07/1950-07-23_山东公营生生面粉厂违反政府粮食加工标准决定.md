　　Shandong Public Sheng Sheng Flour Mill Violates Government Grain Processing Standards Decision

　　Since the State Council of the Central People's Government decided to change grain processing standards at its 25th session, the Jinan Municipal People's Government's Industry and Commerce Bureau has called on all flour mills to prepare to change processing standards. On April 21, a city-wide meeting of rice and flour processing factories was held, deciding to immediately stop producing flour exceeding the "81" standard and rice exceeding the "92" standard. On April 27, the municipal government also announced specific implementation measures. However, the Sheng Sheng Flour Mill, under the Shandong Provincial People's Government, did not comply with the decision and produced 3,415 bags of second-grade flour. The Industry and Commerce Bureau has reported the situation to the provincial government, and the Provincial Finance Committee and the Provincial Industry and Commerce Department have issued instructions stating that, in addition to demoting and recording a major demerit against the comrades directly responsible for this matter, the factory is also ordered to make a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

　　山东公营生生面粉厂违反政府粮食加工标准决定编辑同志：
    自中央人民政府政务院第二十五次政务会议决定改变粮食加工标准后，济南市人民政府工商局即号召各面粉厂准备改变加工标准。并在四月二十一日召开全市米面加工工厂会议，决定立即停制超“八一”面粉和超“九二”米。四月二十七日市府并公布了具体执行办法。但山东省人民政府所属生生面粉厂，竟不遵照决定，磨出二等粉三千四百一十五袋。工商局已据情报告省府，经省财委会及省工商厅函示：除已将对此事直接负责的同志，分别予以撤职及记大过处分外，并令该厂在报上公开检讨。
