    Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau Announcement
    July 7, 1950, Jian Guan Zi No. 1550
    1. In order to make it easier and faster for public and private institutions, organizations, and citizens to apply to our bureau for construction project procedures, and to ensure the rationality and safety of buildings, the following two provisions are hereby made:
    	1. For projects that meet the requirements of Article 3 of the Beijing Municipal Construction Management Provisional Rules, or that require drawings due to factual needs, the project owner should first engage an architect or civil engineer to design the project and submit three copies of the drawings (and calculations if necessary) to the Construction Bureau for review. After receiving the approval notice, the owner should then seek out a construction factory or construction company to sign a contract, and then bring the applicant's and the construction factory's seals to the bureau to obtain a license. This is to avoid delays in starting construction due to the review of the drawings.
    	2. Construction companies shall not design or appraise projects on behalf of the owner. Design, supervision, and appraisal services must be handled by public or private practicing architects or civil engineers registered with this bureau.
    2. This announcement is hereby made.
    Director Wang Mingzhi
    Deputy Director Xu Jingqi
