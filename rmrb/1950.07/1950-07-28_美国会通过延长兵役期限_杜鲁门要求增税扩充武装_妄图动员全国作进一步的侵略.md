　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: On the 25th, the United States Congress took further steps to mobilize the country for further aggression. The House of Representatives passed a bill extending the service term of active military personnel whose service expires within the next twelve months by one year. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Vinson said the bill would affect nearly 300,000 officers and soldiers in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This bill has already been passed by the Senate and will become law as soon as Truman signs it.

　　The House also quickly passed a bill to fulfill Truman's request to remove the current legal restrictions on the number of personnel in the U.S. armed forces (the current law stipulates a maximum limit of 2,005,000 people).

　　According to newspaper reports, the mobilization of reservists is still ongoing, but the exact scale of the mobilization has not been disclosed.

　　To raise funds for these mobilizations and massive expansions of the armed forces, Truman requested Congress on the 25th to amend tax laws to increase tax revenue by $5 billion annually. In a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman George, Truman suggested increasing individual income taxes and slightly increasing corporate profit taxes.

　　It is reported that Truman's proposal will raise income tax rates to the highest levels during the war. The Associated Press reported that a tax expert in Congress estimated that this would mean an increase of at least 20 percent in individual income tax rates.

　　In addition to facing higher taxes, the American people are also forced to buy necessities at higher prices every day.

　　The Federal Reserve Board declared: "Except for a short period in the second half of 1948, consumer prices are currently higher than at any other time."

　　This situation, coupled with a huge amount of war orders with very favorable terms, will naturally lead to a greater increase in the profits of monopoly capitalists. U.S. Steel Corporation announced that its profits for the second quarter of this year exceeded $69.8 million, an increase of more than 58 percent over the second quarter of last year. It is expected that as a result of government orders for tanks, aircraft, and other military equipment, the profits of U.S. Steel and other monopoly companies will rise to new record levels.

### 美国会通过延长兵役期限  杜鲁门要求增税扩充武装  妄图动员全国作进一步的侵略

　　美国会通过延长兵役期限
    杜鲁门要求增税扩充武装 
    妄图动员全国作进一步的侵略
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：二十五日，美国国会采取进一步的步骤，以便动员全国作进一步的侵略。众院通过一项法案，把今后十二个月内服役期满的现役军人的服役期限延长一年。众院军委会主席文森说，该法案将影响近三十万的海陆空军官兵。这一法案已经参院通过，只要杜鲁门签字就可成为法律。
    众院又迅速通过一项法案，实现杜鲁门提出的取消目前对美国武装部队人员之法律限制的请求。（目前的法律规定最高限额为二百万零五千人）
    据报纸消息：后备兵的动员工作仍在继续进行中，但动员的确切规模未被透露。
    杜鲁门为了筹措这些动员与大量扩充武装部队的经费，已于二十五日要求国会修改税法，使每年增加税收五十亿美元。杜鲁门在致参院财政委员会主席乔治的信中，建议增加个人所得税和稍许增加公司利得税。
    据传，杜鲁门的建议将把所得税的税率提高到战时最高的水平。美联社报道：国会的一个税收专家估计，这将意味着个人所得税的税率至少增加百分之二十。
    美国人民除了面临增高的捐税外，还被迫每天以更高的价格购买必需品。
    联邦准备局宣称：“除一九四八下半年的一个短时期外，目前的消费品物价比任何其他时期都高。”
    这种情势加上巨量的条件颇为优厚的战争订货，自然将使垄断资本家的利润有更大的增加。美国钢铁公司宣布，该公司本年第二季的利润超过了六千九百八十万美元，比去年第二季增加了百分之五十八以上。预料由于政府订购坦克、飞机及其他军备物品的结果，美国钢铁公司及其他垄断公司的利润，将升高到新的创纪录的水平。
