Women in the Fifteenth District Actively Participate in Production
Labor Achievements Enhance Women's Social Status
[Report from this newspaper] After the land reform in the Fifteenth District of Beijing's suburbs, liberated women broke free from old feudal moral concepts and actively participated in labor, working shoulder to shoulder with men to strive for a 10% increase in production. After the beginning of spring this year, most women participated in plowing, sowing, watering, and delivering manure; during the wheat harvest, they actively pulled wheat, carried out summer planting, and summer weeding. Wang Jinzhen, a female party member in Yushu Village, after her mutual aid team finished harvesting their own wheat, motivated others to help military families harvest wheat. The mutual aid team of Liu Shumin, a woman from Fenzhuang Village, consisted of eight people, all of whom were liberated peasants. They have persisted from the spring plowing until now, harvesting and threshing their own wheat without using a single male laborer, and have now weeded the fields three times. According to statistics from thirteen villages including Zhaoxindian, Xiaojing, and Kandan, 2,464 women participated in weeding and seedling cultivation. Of the 769 women in Dajing Village, 539 participated in summer planting and weeding. Cui, an elderly woman in her fifties from Xiaowayao Village, led ten women in summer planting and weeding, forming a mutual aid team.

The achievements of women's participation in production have reversed the masses' underestimation of women and enhanced women's social status. Farmer Xiong Zhengwu said, "Women are truly capable; they can do both rough and fine work; they have truly been liberated!" Xiong, the old lady who initially most opposed her daughter-in-law joining the mutual aid team, happily said when she saw her five acres of barren land covered with lush green seedlings, "My daughter-in-law is really good; she can do anything in the mutual aid team!" Women also educated themselves in labor production, and the old idea of "marrying a man to have clothes to wear and food to eat" has been deemed shameful; loving labor has become the most glorious thing.

　　十五区妇女积极参加生产
    劳动成绩提高了妇女社会地位
    【本报讯】京郊十五区在土地改革后，翻身妇女打破了封建的旧道德观念，积极参加劳动，与男人并肩为增产一成而努力。今年开春后，大部分妇女就参加了犁地、点种、浇地、送粪等劳动；麦收时又积极拔麦、夏播、夏锄。榆树庄女党员王金珍的互助组，拔完自己的麦子后，又带动了其他人帮助军属拔麦。汾庄村妇女刘淑敏互助组，八个人全是翻身户，从春耕坚持到现在，自己拔麦、打场，没用一个男工，现已锄地三遍。据赵辛店、小井、看丹等十三个村的统计，参加拔草、锄苗的妇女即有二千四百六十四人。大井村七百六十九个妇女中，参加夏播、锄草的有五百三十九人。小瓦窑村五十多岁的崔老太太夏播锄草，带动了十个妇女，组成互助组。
    妇女参加生产的成绩，扭转了群众轻视妇女的思想，提高了妇女的社会地位。农民熊正武说：“妇女真行了，粗活、细活都能干，真是翻身了！”起先最反对儿媳妇参加互助组的熊老太太，看到自己的五亩荒地长满绿油油的青苗时，也高兴地说：“我家儿媳妇可好了，参加互助组什么都能干了！”妇女们在劳动生产中也教育了自己，“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的旧思想，已被认为可耻，爱劳动已成为最光荣了。
