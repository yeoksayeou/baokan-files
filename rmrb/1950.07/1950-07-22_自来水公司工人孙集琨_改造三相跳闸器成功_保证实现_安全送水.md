　　Self-tapping Workers Sun Jikun successfully remodeled the three-phase trip switch

　　Guarantee to achieve "safe water delivery"
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Sun Jikun, a worker at the Beijing Tap Water Company, successfully improved a single-phase trip switch into a three-phase trip switch, adding a new guarantee for the Tap Water Company to achieve the current slogan: "Safe Water Delivery." Each water source well in the water plant uses nearly 30 electric motors. Each motor needs to be equipped with an automatic trip switch, otherwise, if a circuit accident occurs, the motor will be burned out. Most of the automatic trip switches currently used in the water plant are single-phase trip switches, with only a very small number of three-phase trip switches. (The function of the automatic trip switch is similar to the switch of an electric light fuse; when a circuit accident occurs, it can automatically trip and cut off the current to avoid burning out the motor. There are single-phase trip switches and three-phase trip switches. Single-phase trip switches can only control two wires in the motor, and if a fault occurs in the third wire, it will lose its effectiveness. Three-phase trip switches can control three wires, and in any case, the motor can be prevented from burning out.) Single-phase trip switches cannot fully guarantee the safety of the motor, and many motors were burned out before liberation as a result. Currently, three-phase trip switches are difficult to buy on the market, and the company cannot afford to replace all of them with three-phase trip switches. This has become a difficult problem in achieving the slogan "Safe Water Delivery." Worker Sun Jikun noticed this problem before liberation, but he had no conditions and was unwilling to think of a solution under the reactionary rule at the time. On June 21st of this year, at the Beijing Tap Water Company's awards conference, he won an award for creating a hanging rack for impregnated oil paper, which greatly encouraged him to reconsider this problem. On June 26th, he finally came up with a way to turn a single-phase trip switch into a three-phase trip switch. He cooperated with Cao Boquan, Wan Fuxiang, Gao Shenyou and other colleagues in the factory's electric motor room. Under the encouragement of Yu Tongsheng, chairman of the factory's trade union, and Gu Mengji, the foreman, it was created on July 5th, and the test situation was good. The administration is now studying it and preparing for trial use.

    改造三相跳闸器成功       
    保证实现“安全送水”
    【本报讯】北京市自来水公司工人孙集琨改进单相跳闸器为三相跳闸器成功，使自来水公司对于实现当前口号：“安全送水”增加了新的保证。自来水厂的各水源井，使用近三十部的电力马达。每部马达都需要装自动跳闸器，否则电路发生事故时，即会把马达烧毁。目前自来水厂所使用的大多是单相跳闸器，只有极少数的三相跳闸器，（自动跳闸器的效能类似电灯保险装置的开关器，电路出了事故，可以自动跳开，截断电流，避免烧毁马达。有单相跳闸器与三相跳闸器。单相跳闸器只能节制马达中的两根电线，在第三根电发生故障时，则失去效能。三相跳闸器能节制三根电线，在任何情况下，均可使马达避免烧毁）。单相跳闸器不能完全保障马达的安全，解放前曾因此烧毁马达多部。在目前市场上难于买到三相跳闸器，而且公司也无力全部更换成三相跳闸器。这对实现“安全送水”的口号就成为一个难题。工人孙集琨在解放前即留意到这一问题，但因在当时反动统治下没有条件也不愿意去想办法。今年六月二十一日，自来水公司发奖大会上，他因创造浸滤油纸的挂架而得奖，大大地鼓励了他重新考虑这一问题的勇气。六月二十六日，他终于想出把单相跳闸器变成了三相跳闸器的办法，与该厂电机房工友曹博权、万福祥、郜申酉等合作，在该厂工会主席于桐声、领班谷孟己师傅的鼓励下，于七月五日造成，试验情形良好。现正由行政研究，准备试用。
