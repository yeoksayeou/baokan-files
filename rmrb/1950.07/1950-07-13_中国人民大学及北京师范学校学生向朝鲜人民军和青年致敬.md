　　Students of Renmin University of China and Beijing Normal School Pay Tribute to the Korean People's Army and Youth
    [Our Newspaper] The Student Union of Renmin University of China sent a telegram to the soldiers of the Korean People's Army who are fighting bravely, paying tribute to them. The telegram stated: "Your unprecedented and great victory has made us feel elated; we hereby extend to you our warm fraternal respect and congratulations. You are not fighting in isolation; the working people who love peace all over the world are sympathizing with and supporting you; because your war against aggression is just and progressive. The U.S. imperialists and their running dog, Syngman Rhee, have already dug their own graves. The independence, freedom, and unification that all Korean people yearn for will surely win the final victory. The peace-loving Chinese people will always stand with you and fight to the end for people's democracy!"
    [Another News] All students of Beijing Municipal Normal School wrote a letter to Korean youth, paying tribute to General Kim Il-sung, the Korean People's Army, and the patriotic youth of Korea. The letter stated: "The Syngman Rhee gang, instigated by U.S. imperialism, attacked the Korean people, and U.S. imperialism has shamelessly and openly directly invaded, arousing our infinite indignation. The victory achieved by the Korean People's Army in its great counterattack has made us infinitely excited.

    The Chinese people particularly easily understand the criminal acts committed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Korea. Because not long ago, we were also living in a dark and hopeless life under the rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dog in China, the Chiang Kai-shek gang. However, now, except for Taiwan and Tibet, our people across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party, have defeated U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and are living a peaceful, democratic, free, and happy life. We have every reason to believe that the facts will soon prove that the people of South Korea, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, in the heroic battles of the brave People's Army, and with the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people around the world, will quickly achieve the same great national liberation and people's democratic revolutionary victory as we did.

    We firmly support the statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on June 28th. Chinese youth will do everything in their power to support the heroic and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army "to liberate Taiwan from the American aggressors." Korean patriotic youth friends! We congratulate you on your efforts to strive for the peace, democracy, and unification of your motherland, and on your contributions to this great struggle."

　　中国人民大学及北京师范学校学生向朝鲜人民军和青年致敬
    【本报讯】中国人民大学学生会，向正在英勇作战的朝鲜人民军的将士们发出通电致敬。致敬电文中称：“你们空前伟大的胜利使我们欢欣鼓舞；我们在这里特向你们致以热诚的兄弟般的敬意和祝贺。你们不是孤立的作战，全世界热爱和平的劳动人民都在同情和支持你们；因为你们反侵略的战争是正义的，是进步的。美帝及其走狗李承晚已为他们自己掘好了墓地，全朝鲜人民所渴望的独立、自由和统一，必然会赢得最后的胜利，酷爱和平的中国人民将永远和你们站在一起为争取人民民主而斗争到底！”
    【又讯】北京市立师范学校全体学生写信给朝鲜青年，向金日成将军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜爱国青年致敬。信上说：“美帝国主义所指使的李承晚匪帮向朝鲜人民进攻和美帝国主义无耻地公开直接侵略，引起我们无限的愤恨。朝鲜人民军在伟大的反攻中所取得的胜利，使我们无限的兴奋。
    中国人民特别容易了解美帝国主义及其走狗在朝鲜所干的罪恶行为。因为我们在不久以前，也是在美帝国主义及其在中国的走狗蒋介石匪帮的统治下，过着暗无天日的生活。但是，现在除去台湾、西藏以外，我们全国人民在中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下，已经战胜了美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮，过着和平、民主、自由、幸福的生活。我们完全有理由相信，事实不久也将会证明：南朝鲜的人民将在金日成将军领导下、在英勇的人民军的英勇战斗中，在全世界亿万人民的同情和支持下，迅速获得和我们一样的伟大的全民族解放和人民民主的革命胜利。
    我们坚决拥护我国周恩来外长在六月二十八日所发表的声明，中国青年将用全力从各个方面支持英勇无敌的中国人民解放军“从美国侵略者手中解放台湾”。朝鲜的爱国青年朋友们！我们祝贺你们为争取祖国的和平、民主、统一的努力和在这伟大斗争中的贡献。”
