　　[From Our Newspaper] Summary of a speech by Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, at the Beijing Women's Anti-American Aggression Conference:

　　Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered a speech at the conference. She mainly said: "The American imperialists have unreasonably launched a war of aggression, directly attacking the Korean people with their army, navy, and air force, destroying the unification of Korea, preventing our people from liberating Taiwan, and vigorously interfering in the people's liberation movements in Vietnam and the Philippines. These violent acts seriously violate the Cairo Conference agreement and the Potsdam Declaration." "Furthermore, they fundamentally undermine the United Nations Charter." She then denounced the illegality of the Security Council resolution on the Korean issue. She used many vivid examples to illustrate the situation of people from various countries supporting the Korean people's war of liberation and supporting world peace. She said, "Because of the failure of the American imperialists in supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the Chinese mainland, and the fatal blow they are now receiving in South Korea, we see through that the United States is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and not worth a single blow." Finally, she called on all women in the city and all the people of Beijing and China to resolutely support Premier Zhou's solemn statement, to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, and to actively support the Korean people's war of liberation. Because "the victory of Korea is inseparable from our victory."

    李德全讲话摘要
    【本报讯】全国妇联副主席李德全在北京市妇女反美侵略大会上的讲话摘要：
    中华全国妇联副主席李德全在大会上发表演说。她主要说：“美帝无理的发动侵略战争，直接以海陆空军进攻朝鲜人民，破坏朝鲜的统一，阻止我国人民解放台湾，并且极力干涉越南和菲律宾的人民解放运动，这些强暴的行为严重的违犯了开罗会议的协议和波茨坦的宣言。”“并且是基本的破坏了联合国的宪章。”继而她指斥了安理会关于朝鲜问题的决议的非法。她用许多生动的例子来说明各国人民声援朝鲜人民解放战争，拥护世界和平的情况。她说：“由于美帝在中国大陆上支持蒋匪帮的失败，和现在在南朝鲜受到的致命打击，我们看穿了美国是外强中干、不值一击的。”最后她号召全市妇女和全北京、全中国人民一道坚决拥护周总理的严正的声明，要为解放台湾斗争到底，并积极声援朝鲜人民解放战争。因为“朝鲜的胜利和我们的胜利是分不开的”。
