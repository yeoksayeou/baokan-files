Qinghe Woolen Mill Holds Award Ceremony
    Twelve Awards for Technical Improvements and Rationalization Proposals

[Beijing News Agency] The Qinghe Woolen Mill held an award and punishment conference on the 18th of this month to reward outstanding workers in production and labor over the past six months. A small number of workers with lax labor discipline who caused losses in production were given appropriate punishments.

This time, a total of twelve technical improvements and rationalization proposals were rewarded, with nine receiving material rewards and three receiving commendations. After five researches, Party Yongfu and six other workers in the combing department solved the problem of sliver waste. Their No. 1 combing machine was originally supposed to produce 30 slivers per shaft, but due to limitations of the spindles on the spinning frame, five slivers per shaft were wasted. This not only failed to meet the needs of the spinning machines and affected the quality of the slivers, but also wasted labor and electricity. Now, after improving the structure of the spinning frame and drawing the slivers, the daily output of woolen yarn can be increased by 4 kilograms, increasing production by 20 percent, saving labor and electricity equivalent to 7,432 jin of millet per year. These seven people were awarded eleven bags of flour. After the entire group of workers managing the blast furnace improved iron smelting technology, one kilogram of coke could smelt three kilograms of iron. Now it can smelt six kilograms of iron. It used to take seven hours to smelt a furnace of iron, but now it can be smelted in four hours, saving labor and materials equivalent to 5,860 jin of millet per year, and was awarded eleven bags of flour. Lu Yu, a worker in the finishing and dyeing department, improved the burr raising machine, increasing productivity by 42 percent, saving 535.2 labor-days per year, and was awarded four bags of flour. All the technical improvements created wealth or saved labor and materials equivalent to 30,920 jin of millet for the country, and a total of forty-eight bags of flour were awarded.

A total of nine people were punished. Chen Yulin, a combing machine operator, was lax in labor discipline, produced poor combing quality, and did not take care of the machine. Once, he damaged a "burr steel needle cloth" and was demoted. Ma Zhifu and Liu Zhenyuan were fighting during work, hindering production, and were given disciplinary warnings.

At the awards and punishments conference, Yuan Yonghou, the deputy director of the factory, and Li Defang, the chairman of the labor union, spoke, calling on all employees to use their brains more and create new records.

    【京市新闻处讯】清河制呢厂本月十八日举行奖惩大会，奖励了半年来生产劳动中的优秀职工，对少数劳动纪律松弛引起生产上损失的职工，则给予适当处分。
    这次奖励改进技术，合理化建议共十二件，有九件是物质奖励，三件是精神表扬。梳毛部工人党永福等七人经过五次研究，解决了毛条浪费问题。他们使用的一号梳毛机本来每轴应出三十根毛条，但受到纺纱车上锭子的限制，每轴要浪费五根毛条，既供不上纺纱机用，影响毛条质量，又浪费人工和电力，现在改进纺车构造并牵伸毛条后，每天可增产呢纱四公斤，提高产量百分之二十，全年节省人工和电力折七四三二斤小米。这七个人获奖十一袋面粉。管理鼓风机的全体工人改进化铁技术后，原来一公斤焦炭化三公斤铁，现可化六公斤铁，原化一炉铁需要七小时，现四小时就能化出，全年节省工料折五八六○斤小米，获奖十一袋面粉。整染部工人卢玉改进刺果起毛机，提高生产率百分之四十二，全年节省人工五三五·二个，获奖四袋面粉。所有各项改进技术共为国家创造财富或节约工料折小米三○九二○斤，共获奖四十八袋面粉。
    受到处分的共有九人，梳毛机车工陈玉林劳动纪律松懈，梳毛质量差，不爱护机器，有一次损坏“毛轮钢针布”一块，给予降级处分。马志福、刘振元在工作时打闹，妨碍生产，分别给予记过处分。
    在奖惩大会上，该厂副厂长袁永厚和工会主任李德芳讲话，号召全体职工多多开动脑筋，创造新纪录。
