    Report on Production Competition Achievements to Chairman Mao
    In May and June, an excess value equivalent to 5.5 million jin of millet was created, and 250 advanced producers and work models emerged.
    [This newspaper's Tangshan dispatch] On July 5th, all employees of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the successful completion of the Red May production, economy, safety, and model creation competition. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    On May 16th, we wrote to you to report on the production situation. Now we report to you again on the successful completion of our Red May production, economy, safety, and model creation competition.
    Through the competition movement in May and June, under the battle slogan of "Safe Power Transmission," thanks to the correct leadership of the higher authorities and the united efforts of all employees, ideological work has taken another step forward, and there have been many gains in production, economy, and the establishment of new management systems.
    The first collective contract for safe power transmission has been overfulfilled with everyone's high sense of responsibility and active efforts. After the power plant signed the collective contract for safe power transmission, no responsibility accidents occurred. No. 1 and No. 2 boilers and No. 1 and No. 2 steam turbines have been running continuously and safely for an average of 117 days. The Tangshan substation has been running safely for 326 consecutive days. The 77,000-volt power grid line has also successfully completed the annual safe power transmission task. The average coal consumption in June was still 0.577 kilograms per kilowatt-hour. The electricity sales target for the second quarter exceeded the plan by 28.12 percent. The electricity sales target for six months exceeded the quota by 24.3 percent. As a result of excess production, rationalization proposals, and strict implementation of the budget system, and strict economy throughout the movement, a total excess value of 5,500,000 jin of millet was created. In addition, off-book materials worth about 1,500,000 jin of millet were inventoried. More importantly, 250 advanced producers and model workers emerged in the movement, including three who were rated as special-class labor heroes: Comrade Li Xiujun, the banner of saving coal, Comrade Feng Tiyuan, the creator of the model, and Comrade Zhao Hongen, the model of love for the factory, as well as seventeen model work units. This gives us more confidence and a more solid foundation for our future work.
    During the great days from "May Day" to "July 1st," we deeply felt the great political and educational significance of the revolutionary competition movement. We also realized that the collective contract is indeed an advanced production system. It helps us to more effectively complete production tasks and establish correct public-private relations, and raises the labor attitude of the workers to the height of political consciousness. Now we are conducting a mass summary; establishing models, rewarding advanced individuals; concentrating good experiences, adhering to and promoting them; examining shortcomings, and striving to overcome them. Under the slogan of "consolidating victory, overcoming shortcomings, and advancing steadily," we will continue to work hard to raise production work to a higher level, so as to ensure long-term safe power transmission and strive to complete the annual electricity sales task before the October Revolution Day, and contribute more to the people's New China.
    Respectfully wishing you good health!
                    All employees of Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant

　　唐山电业局及发电厂全体职工
    向毛主席报告生产竞赛成绩
    五、六两月创造超额价值五百五十万斤小米，涌现先进生产者和工作模范二百五十名。
    【本报唐山讯】唐山电业局及唐山发电厂全体职工七月五日写信给毛主席，报告红五月生产节约安全创模竞赛运动胜利完成的情况。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在五月十六日，我们曾写信向你报告生产情况。现再把我们红五月生产节约安全创模竞赛运动胜利完成的情况报告你。
    经过五、六两月的竞赛运动，在“安全发送电”的战斗口号下，由于上级的正确领导及全体职工的团结努力，在思想工作上更提高了一步，在生产节约和建立新的管理制度方面也有很多收获。
    第一个安全发送电的集体合同已经在大家的高度负责积极努力下超额完成。发电厂在订立安全发送电的集体合同后，未发生过任何责任事故。一、二号锅炉和一、二号汽机连续安全运转平均达一一七天。唐山变电站连续安全运转三二六天。七万七千伏特电力网线路也胜利完成全年安全送电的任务。六月份的平均煤耗仍为每度○·五七七公斤。第二季售电任务超过计划百分之二八·一二。六个月售电任务超过定额百分之二四·三。整个运动中由于超额生产、合理化建议和严格的执行预决算制度、厉行节约的结果，共创造了超额价值五、五○○、○○○斤小米。又清点出账外物资约值一、五○○、○○○斤小米。更重要的是在运动中涌现了二五○名先进生产者和模范工作者，其中被评为特等劳动英雄者三名，有省煤旗帜李秀俊同志，创造模范冯禔元同志，爱厂模范赵洪恩同志，还有十七个模范工作单位。这使我们今后工作更有信心，基础更结实。
    在“五一”到“七一”的伟大日子里，我们深深感到革命竞赛运动的伟大政治教育意义。也体会到集体合同确是一个先进的生产制度。它帮助我们更有效地完成生产任务，和建立正确的公私关系，把职工群众的劳动态度提高到政治自觉的高度。现在我们正在进行群众性的总结；树立模范，奖励先进；集中好的经验，坚持和推广下去；检查缺点，力求克服。在“巩固胜利、克服缺点、稳步前进”的口号下继续努力，把生产工作再提高一步，以保证长期安全发送电，争取全年售电任务于十月革命节前完成，为人民的新中国贡献更多的力量。
    敬祝身体健康！
                    唐山电业局及唐山发电厂全体职工
