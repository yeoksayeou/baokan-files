　　Taiwan Must Be Liberated
    Ye Mang
    The close relationship between Taiwan and mainland China was recorded as early as 605 AD (during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui). After 1697, Taiwan officially became a part of China. When Japan invaded and occupied Taiwan (1895), the traitorous Manchu government offered Taiwan to Japan with both hands. At that time, an independence movement of the Chinese people took place in Taiwan, establishing the Republic of Taiwan to resist the Manchu government's traitorous behavior and Japanese aggression. The failure of this movement allowed Japan to occupy all of Taiwan. Japan occupied Taiwan for 51 years until Japan's surrender in 1945.
    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which now occupies Taiwan, is just a group of traitors to the Chinese nation. Our Central People's Government has the full right to eliminate them and liberate Taiwan. Leaving aside the issue of the United States directly violating the Cairo Declaration (1943), everyone please think: Wasn't the Chinese people's eight-year war of resistance fought to defeat Japan and recover the land that Japanese imperialism had plundered from China, such as the Northeast, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, etc., but to create a Taiwanese colony for American imperialism, or a Taiwanese trusteeship for the United Nations? Taiwan was, is, and will be a part of Chinese territory. This has been clearly stated in the solemn declaration of the Central People's Government.
    The Chinese people's eight-year war of resistance was able to drive away the Japanese imperialists; we are confident that with the great strength of the Chinese people today, we will certainly be able to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. If the American imperialists want to participate in this by sending a fleet, we will certainly be able to drive them away as well. In Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, we have already driven away the American imperialists and their armed forces. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang wants to imitate the Manchu Qing's Empress Dowager Cixi and Zaiyi by offering Taiwan to the United States with both hands, but what the United States is encountering is no longer the weak and incompetent Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu of more than fifty years ago, but the strong Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The United States should not even think of ruling and exploiting Taiwan for fifty-one years as cheaply and easily as Japan did back then. Truman's wishful thinking declaration: "The determination of Taiwan's future status must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or the consideration of the United Nations." This is utter nonsense! No one has authorized the President of the United States of North America to be the overlord of the Pacific! The only ones who have the right to speak on the status of Taiwan are the Chinese people and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Our outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation must liberate Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and American imperialism with resolute action!

　　台湾一定要解放
    叶芒
    台湾对中国大陆的密切关系，早在公元六○五年（隋代大业年间）即有纪载。一六九七年以后，台湾正式成为中国的一部分。等到日本侵占台湾的时候（一八九五），满清卖国政府，将台湾拱手奉送与日本。当时台湾曾经发生中国人民的独立运动，成立台湾民主国，以反抗满清的卖国行为和日本的侵略，这次运动的失败，使日本得以占据全台湾。到日本一九四五年投降为止，日本共占有台湾五十一年。
    现在占有台湾的蒋介石匪帮，只是一批中国民族的叛徒，我中央人民政府有完全的权利加以肃清，解放台湾。且把美国直接违反开罗宣言（一九四三）的问题撇开不提，大家请想一想：难道中国人民的八年抗战，不是为了打败日本，收复日本帝国主义从中国掠夺去的土地，如东北、台湾、澎湖列岛等，而是替美国帝国主义打出一个台湾殖民地，或者替联合国打出一个台湾托管区来吗？台湾以前是，现在是，将来也是中国领土的一部分，这已在中央人民政府的严正申明中，明白表示出来了。
    中国人民的八年抗战，能够打走日本帝国主义者；我们就确信以今天伟大的中国人民力量，一定能够消灭蒋介石匪帮，假如美国帝国主义者要以舰队来参加在这中间的话，我们也一定能够打走它。在天津、青岛、上海、广州，我们已经把美国帝国主义者及其武装赶走了。蒋介石匪帮要想仿效满清的那拉氏和载漪，把台湾拱手奉送与美国，可是美国所遇到的已经不是五十几年以前软弱无能的唐景崧与刘永福之流，而是坚强的中国人民，中国共产党，和中国人民解放军。美国就休想和日本当时一样，很廉价的，很轻易的统治和剥削台湾这么五十一年。杜鲁门单相思式的宣称：“台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑。”这根本是胡说八道！没有任何人授权北美合众国的总统来当太平洋的霸王！对于台湾的地位，唯一有发言权的是中国人民和中国人民的领袖，毛泽东主席！
    我们中华民族的优秀的子孙，一定要从蒋介石匪帮和美国帝国主义的统治下，以坚决的行动，解放台湾！
