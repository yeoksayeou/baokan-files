Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th: The news of the first British deaths in the Korean War – the sacrifices of British participation in the American war against the Korean people – has made the British people clearly realize that they will have to pay with their own blood for the policies of their government. The vast majority of the British people still find it difficult to know the real situation in Korea despite newspapers, broadcasts, and official announcements. However, on the whole, the working class is pleased to see the arrogant Americans being punished by the Korean People's Army. Reactionary newspapers are now also commenting sarcastically on the American army. The Daily Express wrote: "These Asians, in no way showing the fear of air attacks and American ground forces as hopefully predicted by American experts in Tokyo, even defiantly surrounded a battalion of American troops." The Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, contemptuously referred to American weapons, saying: "American aircraft have failed to stop the advance of the North Korean army. In this war, B-29 aircraft are completely unsuitable, and jet planes are too fast to concentrate attacks on the much slower and more agile North Korean aircraft." The Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Korea, Buckley, believes the American future is exceptionally bleak. In his telegram, he said: "The situation on the Korean front is extremely serious." The American hope that the front could be stabilized and then a counter-offensive launched has proven to be unfounded. On the other hand, the hope that the participation of American ground forces would shake the morale of North Korea has not been realized. As for the morale of the American army, New York Herald Tribune reporter Bigart made the following description on the 10th: "During the last war, I saw the American army in unfavorable situations many times. However, I have never seen the American army show such distress on the front line as I did yesterday." A few days ago, British, especially American, newspapers and military spokesmen used the most contemptuous words to refer to the North Korean army, such as "Red elements," "Asian mobs," "Communist bandits," etc. However, a significant change can now be noticed in this regard. For example, the Daily Herald said on the 10th: "American military experts in Washington are surprised by the excellent tactics of North Korea and the good performance of their army."

　　干涉朝鲜的战争一再失利
    美英反动报纸悲观失望
    英人民因美帝受惩罚而高兴
    【新华社十二日讯】电通社伦敦十日讯：关于第一批英国人在朝鲜战死——英国参加美国的反朝鲜人民战争的牺牲者——的消息，已使英国人民清楚地认识到，为了他们的政府的政策，他们将要付出自己的鲜血作为代价。绝大多数的英国人民经过报刊、广播和官方的公告仍然难以知道朝鲜的真实情况。然而，整个地说来，工人阶级看到了骄横的美国人在朝鲜人民军手里受到惩罚而感到高兴。反动报纸现在也在冷嘲热讽地评论美国军队。每日快报写道：“这些亚洲人，丝毫没有像在东京的美国专家满怀希望所预料的那样，对空军的攻击和美国地面部队，表现出害怕的心情。他们甚至挑战地包围了美军的一个营”。工党的报纸每日先驱报轻蔑地谈及美国武器说：“美国飞机并未能阻止北朝鲜军队的前进。在这种战争中，Ｂ——二十九型飞机完全不适用，喷气式飞机也太快了，以致不能集中攻击比较慢得多而很灵敏的北朝鲜飞机”。每日电讯报驻朝鲜记者柏克利认为美国前途异常黯淡。在他拍回的电报中说：“朝鲜前线局势异常严重”。美国从前满怀希望，认为前线可以稳定下来，并可能接着发动反攻，然而这希望已证实是毫无根据的。在另一方面，以为美国地面部队参战会动摇北朝鲜士气的希望，也没有实现。至于美军的士气，纽约先驱论坛报记者比加特在十日作了如下的一段描写：“在上次大战中，我曾经有不少次看到美军处在不利的情况中。然而，我从来没有像昨日那样看到美军在前线所表现的痛苦情况”。几天以前，英国特别是美国的报纸和军事发言人，曾用最轻蔑的字眼来谈及北朝鲜军队，这些字眼有“赤色分子”，“亚洲暴民”，“共匪”等等。然而，现在也可以在这方面注意到一种有意义的改变。例如每日先驱报十日说：“华盛顿美国军事专家对北朝鲜的精良韬略和他们的军队的良好表现，感觉诧异”。
