　　Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea
    Beijing Workers Hold Rallies
    Determined to Support the Anti-Aggression Struggle by Increasing Production
    [This newspaper reports] Workers in Beijing are holding rallies and writing letters directly to this newspaper, resolutely expressing their opposition to American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. They are determined to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the heroic struggle of the Korean people with practical actions to increase production.
    The Beijing Garment Factory Trade Union Sixth Branch has begun to organize workers to study and discuss various documents related to opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and to organize lecture meetings. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the Tianqiao Branch invited a person in charge of the Ministry of Culture and Education to convey Fan Changjiang, President of the People's Daily, on the report "The Situation of the Korean War". The General Factory Trade Union held a forum on the 21st. Geng Yongfu, a worker in the Cutting Department, said: "American imperialism is like an incurable patient. If it doesn't start a war, it may prolong its life a little longer; if it starts a war, it will only die sooner." Yu Guoying, a worker in the Repair Department, said: "The fundamental reason why American imperialism is starting a war today is because Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, these two dogs, can no longer hold onto its two plundered markets in Asia. Therefore, it has to come out and armedly interfere in the Korean civil war and prevent the People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan."
    All employees of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau have held mass meetings and forums in the bureau. The linemen who go out to work every day put slogans on their vehicles and beat gongs and drums along the way to publicize to the citizens. Worker Yang Baozhang said: "It is our duty to publicize to the masses and expose the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism." The bureau's fifteen business stations and toll stations have also launched publicity against American aggression and signature campaigns to protect world peace in conjunction with their work. The staff of each station took out their own money to buy red and green paper, made slogans and cartoons, and pasted them on the walls inside and outside the stations. In these two days, about 1,000 users at each station signed the peace signature book.
    The Beijing Third District Liberation Printing Factory responded to the call to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea by holding a production competition. It is scheduled to print 20,000 copies of the book "Oppose American Imperialism's Aggression Against Asia" before the 22nd, while not delaying other production tasks. Branch cadres also went to the factory to help workers with publicity and mobilization work.

    On July 20, all employees of the Changxindian Railway Factory held a rally against the new American aggression. Worker Wang Jinyuan said: "American imperialism is so cruel and aggressive in invading Taiwan and Korea, it is utterly hateful. I was very excited to hear the news of the successive victories of the Korean people in heroically fighting the American aggressor troops." Song Liang said: "We have tasted imperialist aggression. We will never allow imperialism to come again. We must step up the production of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars to support the Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan." The meeting also unanimously passed a telegram opposing American aggression and paying tribute to the Korean people who are heroically fighting the American aggressor troops.

    The First District District Committee, with the assistance of the Trade Union Office, successively held five speech meetings against the American aggression movement, explaining to the audience the current situation of the Korean War, the nature of the Korean War, the future of the Korean War, and the current tasks of our working class. More than 900 workers have listened to the lectures. After listening to the lectures, they expressed great indignation at the aggression of the outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger—American imperialism, and they were full of confidence in the victory of the Korean people's anti-aggression war.

    Cheng Hao, a worker at the Dongzhimen Branch of the Yanjing Paper Mill, felt very angry when he read the article "General Kim Il Sung, Leader of the Korean People, Broadcasts to the People and Soldiers of the Whole Country" in the newspaper, and wrote a letter to this newspaper saying: "The extremely shameless American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek have been defeated by the Chinese people, but American imperialism has extended its bloody claws to the Korean people. This kind of death struggle will surely be completely crushed by the people and soldiers of the entire Korean nation under the leadership of General Kim Il Sung. At the same time, Taiwan will always belong to the Chinese people, and no one can stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan."
                                        (Cheng Hao)
    The Beijing Texaco Petroleum Company Trade Union wrote a letter to this newspaper saying: "The Chinese people firmly oppose the clamor of the warmongers and will smash any action by American imperialism to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. The iron facts of the past prove that any imperialism will be defeated, and victory will surely belong to the people. The Syngman Rhee puppet army and the American planes, artillery, warships, and armies participating in the Korean civil war cannot stop the heroic Korean people from advancing."
                          (Texaco Company Trade Union)
    All members of the Second Group of the Lathe Workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory wrote a letter to this newspaper saying: The shameless aggression of American imperialism before its death further exposes its ferocious true form! We are telling the American imperialists: peace-loving people all over the world and the oppressed have stood up to firmly oppose you, and we have enough strength and confidence to defeat your aggression. If you dare to come, we will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate you. All our group members also pay tribute to all the heroic and courageous patriotic and peace-loving soldiers and people of Korea. We are determined to express our wishes with the practical action of stepping up production and completing the full-month task for August half a month ahead of schedule.

　　反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜
    京市工人纷纷集会
    决心以增加生产支援反侵略斗争
    【本报讯】京市工人们纷纷举行集会，或直接写信给本报，坚决表示反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜。并决心用增加生产的实际行动来支援台湾的解放，声援朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。
    北京被服厂工会六分会已开始组织工人，学习讨论有关反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜的各种文件，组织讲演会。天桥分厂在二十二日下午，请文教部负责人传达人民日报社长范长江关于《朝鲜战争形势》的报告。总厂工会二十一日举行了座谈会。裁剪部工人耿永富说：“美帝就好像一个无可救药的病人。它不发动战争，还可能多延长一些寿命；它发动战争，就只会早一点死去。”修理部工人于国英说：“美帝今天发动战争的根本原因，是因为蒋介石和李承晚这两条狗，已经守不住它在亚洲的两个掠夺市场了。所以，它不得不自己出来，武装干涉朝鲜内战和阻止人民解放军解放台湾。”
    北京电业局全体职工，已在局内召开了群众大会和座谈会。每天出去工作的外线工人，在自己的交通车贴上标语，沿路打着锣鼓，向市民进行宣传。工人杨宝璋说：“向群众宣传，揭露美帝的侵略阴谋，是我们应尽的责任。”该局十五个营业站和收费站，更结合工作展开了反对美国侵略的宣传和保护世界和平的签名工作。各站的职工们自己掏出钱来买红绿纸，制成标语漫画，贴在站内外的墙壁上。各站在这两天中，约有一千多用户在和平签名簿上签了名。
    京市三区解放印刷厂以生产竞赛来响应反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动的号召，预定二十二日以前印成“反对美帝侵略亚洲”书籍两万册，同时，要不耽误其他生产任务。分馆干部也下厂帮助工友们从事宣传鼓动工作。

    七月二十日，长辛店铁路工厂全体职工召开反美国新侵略大会，工友王金元说：“美帝国主义狼心狗肺侵略台湾和朝鲜，令人可恨透了。朝鲜人民英勇打击美国侵略军的节节胜利消息，我听了非常兴奋。”宋亮说：“帝国主义的侵略我们尝到过了。我们决不准帝国主义再来，我们要加紧机、客、货车的生产，支援解放军解放台湾。”大会并一致通过反对美国侵略及向现正英勇打击美国侵略军的朝鲜人民致敬的通电。

    第一区区委会协助工会办事处先后召开了五次反对美国侵略运动演讲会，向听众讲解了朝鲜战争现况、朝鲜战争的性质、朝鲜战争的前途、咱们工人阶级目前的任务等问题。听讲的工人已有九百多人，他们在听讲以后，对于外强中干的纸老虎——美国帝国主义的侵略表示了极大的愤慨，对朝鲜人民反侵略战争的胜利都充满了信心。

    燕京造纸厂东直门分厂的工人程浩在报纸上读了《朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军向全国军民广播》一文时，感到很愤怒，特写信给本报说：“无耻已极的美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石已被中国人民打垮了，美帝却又以血爪伸向朝鲜人民。这种垂死挣扎的暴行，一定会被金日成将军领导下的全朝鲜军民完全粉碎的。同时，台湾是永属于中国人民的，任何人不能阻挡中国人民解放台湾。”
                                        （程浩）
    北京德士古煤油公司工会写信给本报说：“中国人民坚决反对战贩们的叫嚣，并将粉碎美帝阻止中国人民解放台湾的任何行动。过去的历史铁般地证明了：任何帝国主义都一定被打垮的，胜利一定是属于人民的。李承晚傀儡军队和参加朝鲜内战的美国的飞机、大炮、军舰和陆军都阻止不了英勇的朝鲜人民的前进。”
                          （德士古公司工会）
    华北农业机械总厂车工间第二小组全体组员，写信给本报说：美帝国主义垂死前的无耻侵略，更暴露出它穷凶极恶的真形！我们正告美帝国主义者：全世界爱好和平的人民，以及被压迫者都已经站起来坚决反对你们了，我们有足够的力量和信心打败你的侵略。你敢于来，我们就要坚决彻底的消灭你们。我们全体组员并向朝鲜全体英勇果敢的爱祖国、爱和平的战士和人民致敬，我们决心以加紧生产，提前半月完成八月份全月任务这一实际行动来表示我们的愿望。
