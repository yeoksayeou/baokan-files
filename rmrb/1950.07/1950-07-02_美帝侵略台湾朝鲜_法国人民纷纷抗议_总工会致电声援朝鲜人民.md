　　Xinhua News Agency, June 30th, TASS, Paris: Broad sections of the French people are protesting against the American military intervention in Korea.
    The French Women's Union wrote to the American Embassy in Paris, saying: "We express to you the deep indignation felt by hundreds of thousands of mothers upon hearing the news of the American government's military intervention in Korea. The French Women's Union believes that this action stems from your government's desire to launch a war, and points out the hypocrisy of the statements repeatedly made by your government regarding respect for the rights of all peoples."
    The Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom published a letter of protest to Truman on June 29, protesting the American government's military intervention in Korea. The letter also pointed out that the American government has already launched its war and interventionist policy against Taiwan, which belongs to China, and Vietnam, which is striving for national independence.
    The Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom demanded: the right to self-determination of all peoples has long been declared, therefore the independence of Korea must be respected, and the Korean people must have the freedom to choose their own democratic system.
    The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communique stating: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor has held a meeting and decided to send a telegram to the working people of Korea, expressing support for the struggle of Korean trade union organizations against American interventionists.
    The communique stated: "The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor strongly protests the unprecedented provocations made by the Washington government against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China."
    The International Association of Democratic Lawyers also protested against the American military intervention in Korea.
