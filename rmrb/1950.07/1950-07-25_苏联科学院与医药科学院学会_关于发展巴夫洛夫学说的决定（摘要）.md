Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th TASS dispatch: The People's Daily recently published the decision of the Scientific Conference of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. Note: This conference was held in Moscow from June 28th to July 4th to discuss various issues of Academician Pavlov's physiological theory. The decision stated: The conference fully endorsed Academician Bykov's report on "The Development of Pavlov's Theory (Tasks and Prospects)" and Professor Smolyensky's report on "The Path to Developing Pavlov's Ideas in the Pathophysiology of Higher Nervous Activity."

Pavlov's Brilliant Theory Signifies a New Era in Natural Science

The decision then pointed out: The great Russian physiologist Pavlov invented a natural scientific and objective method to study the life functions of organisms. He made creative research on the physiology of blood circulation; he founded the theory of nervous dyspepsia, especially his brilliant theory in higher nervous activity, which means that the development of creative natural science has entered a new era.

The Communist Party, the Soviet government, and Lenin and Stalin themselves highly valued Pavlov's scientific activities and paid special attention to the development of this activity. The Soviet Union has created particularly favorable conditions for the successful development of Pavlov's scientific heritage.

In this field, Soviet physiology has made several significant achievements. However, in many respects, the study of Pavlov's scientific heritage has not followed the path of developing his ideas.

Various Pseudo-Scientific Concepts Hinder the Development of Pavlov's Theory

The development of Pavlov's ideas and the application of his theory to medicine and biology have been fiercely opposed by supporters of various metaphysical pseudo-scientific concepts—such as Stern and her "school," which reflect the influence of reactionary science advocates in capitalist countries that damage Soviet science. The decision described Academician Beritashvili and some physiologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and neuropathologists with idealistic ideas who opposed Pavlov's theory. The development of Pavlov's ideas in medicine was also hampered by the broad anti-scientific Virchow (German professor of physiology - translator) thought trend in pathology. Some scientists in several advanced research institutions who were responsible for developing Pavlov's theory did not lead the struggle against such anti-Pavlov pseudo-scientific tendencies. Instead, they themselves ignored the work of developing Pavlov's ideas on several fundamental issues and revised many of his main concepts. The meeting very clearly confirmed that Academician Orbeli and his closest group of students had followed an incorrect path. They misled researchers and hindered the development of Pavlov's theory. The open discussion at the meeting revealed all the errors of Academician Orbeli's position; he had replaced Pavlov's views with his own erroneous concepts on many occasions. The decision also described the shortcomings in the work of Academician Speransky and some other students and followers of Pavlov.

Pavlov's Ideas Achieve Complete Victory in Soviet Science

At the same time, the meeting very happily emphasized that Pavlov's ideas have achieved complete victory in Soviet science.

Pavlov confirmed that all vital activities of complex organisms, including psychological activities, depend on living conditions. His outstanding scientific achievement has placed Soviet physiology in the leading position in the world and opened up broad prospects for the further development of physiology. This achievement has created a solid natural scientific foundation for the work of scientifically transforming medicine and psychology. It has great value for education and sports and can make great contributions to linguistics.

Pavlov's discoveries in the field of higher nervous activity are the greatest achievements of modern science in the study of the brain. These discoveries constitute a powerful natural scientific foundation for the materialist worldview and become a powerful weapon for our ideological struggle against any manifestations of idealism and obscurantism.

The discussions during the meeting most clearly showed that the Soviet Union has a huge scientific force, which can creatively supplement Pavlov's theory and apply it to all fields of physiology, medicine, psychology, and agronomy, and can correctly guide the activities of domestic physiology and medical institutions.

Take Various Measures to Further Develop the Theoretical Basis of Pavlov's Theory

In order to further develop Pavlov's theory and strengthen the connection between Pavlov's theory and practical activities, the meeting decided to instruct the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences to formulate the necessary organizational and scientific measures in the shortest possible period to further develop the theoretical basis of Pavlov's theory and apply his theory to medicine, pedagogy, sports, and poultry farming. The meeting believed that it is necessary to revise the scientific research plans in physiology and medicine, and it is necessary to base this plan on the development of Pavlov's theory and its extensive exploration work in that direction. Regarding personnel training, the meeting believed that it is necessary to revise the courses of the main subjects of physiology and medicine, to replace some relevant courses based on Pavlov's physiology, and to add specialized subjects such as the principles of physiology and pathology of higher nervous activity in universities, medical and educational colleges, and advanced doctor training institutions.

The meeting instructed the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences to convene scientific conferences every year to critically and conscientiously discuss specific issues of Pavlov's physiology, especially issues related to the physiology and pathology of higher nervous activity; and to intensify the training of talents in the physiology and pathology of higher nervous activity in the research institutes of universities; and to widely launch discussions on the main issues of Pavlov's theory in newspapers and magazines.

The meeting urged all workers in physiology and medicine to creatively develop Pavlov's theory in the interests of the people on the basis of free criticism and self-criticism.

　　苏联科学院与医药科学院学会
    关于发展巴夫洛夫学说的决定（摘要）
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：真理报顷发表苏联科学院与苏联医药科学院科学会议的决定。按：该会议系于六月二十八日至七月四日在莫斯科举行，讨论科学院院士巴夫洛夫生理学学说的各种问题。该决定称：会议完全赞同科学院院士比科夫关于“巴夫洛夫的理论的发展（任务及前途）”的报告，和斯莫连斯基教授关于“在高级神经活动的病理生理学方面发扬巴夫洛夫思想的途径”的报告。
    巴夫洛夫的辉煌学说意味着自然科学进入一个新纪元
    该决定继而指出：伟大的俄罗斯生理学家巴夫洛夫发明了用自然科学的客观方法来研究生物的生活机能，他对血液循环生理学作了创造性的研究；他创立了关于神经性消化障碍的理论，特别是他在高级神经活动方面创立了辉煌的学说，这意味着创造性的自然科学的发展进入了一个新纪元。
    共产党、苏维埃政府及列宁和斯大林本人对巴夫洛夫的科学活动评价甚高，并特别注意这种活动的发展。苏联曾给巴夫洛夫的科学遗产的顺利发扬，创造了特别有利的条件。
    在这一领域中，苏联生理学拥有若干显著的成就。然而，在许多方面对巴夫洛夫科学遗产的钻研却并没有遵循发扬他的思想的途径。
    各种冒牌科学概念妨害了巴夫洛夫学说的发展
    发扬巴夫洛夫的思想以及将他的学说应用于医学与生物学的工作，曾遭到各种形而上学的冒牌科学概念的拥护者之猛烈反对——如斯特恩与她的“学派”便是一例，这些观念反映着损害苏联科学的资本主义各国反动科学的鼓吹者之影响。该决定叙述了科学院院士贝利塔施维利以及某些怀有唯心主义思想的生理学家、心理学家、精神病学家和神经病理学家，对抗巴夫洛夫学说。在医学方面发扬巴夫洛夫的思想也遭到病理学中广阔的反科学的微耳和（德国生理学教授——译）思潮之阻挠。若干先进研究机关里某些应负责发扬巴夫洛夫学说的科学家，竟不曾领导反对那种反巴夫洛夫的冒牌的科学倾向的斗争，他们自己反而忽视了在若干基本问题上发扬巴夫洛夫思想的工作，并修改了他许多主要的概念。会议非常清楚地确认：院士奥贝里及其最亲近的一群学生已遵循不正确的途径，他们使研究者迷乱了方向，妨害了巴夫洛夫学说的发展。会议中的公开讨论揭露了科学院院士奥贝里的立场全部错误；他在许多场合中曾以自己的错误概念代替巴夫洛夫的观点。该决定并叙述了科学院院士斯皮兰斯基及巴夫洛夫其他某些学生和追随者工作中的缺点。
    巴夫洛夫的思想在苏联科学中获得完全胜利
    同时，会议非常欣慰地强调指出：巴夫洛夫的思想已在苏联科学中获得完全胜利。
    巴夫洛夫确认复杂的有机物的一切生机活动，包括心理活动，都是取决于生存条件；他这种卓越的科学成就已使苏联生理学进居世界首位，而且为生理学的进一步发展开辟了广阔的天地。这种成就为医学和心理学循科学方针加以改造的工作创造了巩固的自然科学基础，它对教育和体育已有了很大价值，并且能对语言学有很大的贡献。
    巴夫洛夫在高级神经活动领域内的发现是现代科学在研究脑部上所获得的最伟大的成就，这些发现构成唯物世界观的强有力的自然科学基础，成为我们对唯心论及愚昧主义的任何表现进行思想斗争的有力武器。
    会议间的讨论最为明晰地显示了苏联拥有巨大的科学力量，能将巴夫洛夫的理论予以创造性的补充，并且应用到生理学、医学、心理学、农学的一切领域内，能正确地指导国内生理学和医学机关的活动。
    采取各种措施进一步发扬巴夫洛夫学说的理论基础
    为了进一步发扬巴夫洛夫的学说并加强巴夫洛夫的学说与实际活动的联系，会议决定责成苏联科学院主席团及苏联医学科学院主席团在可能最短的期间内，制订组织上及科学上的必要措施以便进一步发扬巴夫洛夫学说的理论基础，并且把他的学说应用到医学、教育学、体育及家禽饲养各方面。会议认为必须修正生理学及医学中的科学研究计划，并且必须以发展巴夫洛夫理论及其方向的广泛探究工作作为这个计划的基础。关于人才训练方面，会议认为必须修正生理学及医学各主科的课程，以巴夫洛夫的生理学为基础而改换若干有关课程，在各大学、医学和教育学院以及高级医生训练机关内增设高级神经活动的生理学和病理学原理等专门科目。
    会议责成苏联科学院及苏联医学科学院每年召集科学会议，批判地认真地讨论巴夫洛夫生理学的具体问题，特别是关于高级神经活动的生理学及病理学方面的问题；并以大学的研究院加紧训练高级神经活动的生理学和病理学的人才；在报章杂志上，广泛展开关于巴夫洛夫学说主要问题的讨论。
    会议敦促生理学和医学中的全体工作者在自由批评和自我批评的基础上，为了人民的利益，而创造性地发扬巴夫洛夫的学说。
