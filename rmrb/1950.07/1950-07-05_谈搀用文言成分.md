On Mixing Literary Chinese Elements
    Ye Shengtao
    This time, let's talk about the issue of mixing in Literary Chinese elements. I'm not feeling well, my head is swollen and my eyes ache, so I can only talk a little.
    Why mix in Literary Chinese elements? There are many reasons. We have read Literary Chinese. We haven't learned the language well. We feel that modern spoken language is poor, as if it's not enough to use. We can't distinguish the boundary between Literary Chinese and modern spoken language. And there are other reasons.
    But the average reader may not have read Literary Chinese at all. Their language training may be better than ours; they speak purely and don't feel impoverished. Judging by their language habits, when they see our hodgepodge, even if they can understand it, at least they don't feel it's very familiar.
    Moreover, many of the materials in newspapers now need to be broadcast from the radio, and read aloud to everyone in reading groups. In order to cater to the audience, first, we must avoid wordy and complex sentences, and second, we must minimize the use of Literary Chinese elements. Like "日趋好转 (rì qū hǎo zhuǎn - steadily improving)" which we can see almost every day recently, both "日 (rì - daily)" and "趋 (qū - trending towards)" are Literary Chinese elements. Also, the word "则 (zé - then/in that case)" is recently seen every day used as a conjunction; this comes from Literary Chinese and you must be familiar with the Literary Chinese tone (not the spoken language tone) to understand it. We are too familiar with these, but can we guarantee that the listeners truly understand? (If written in phonetic script, these elements, after a day or two, even the author himself will not be able to recognize.)
    Now, I will give some examples below, and ask the readers to think about them from both the perspective of reading and listening: Does it seem a little strange to read? Does it sound a little awkward to listen?
    (1) After repeated propaganda, and driven by the CCP branch members and skilled workers in various industries... - April 5, Second Edition, "Ning, Bao Disaster Areas Overcome Winter Famine"
    (2) More than 340,000 unemployed workers in the city will participate in dredging the river... - June 19, Third Edition, "Local People's Governments and Trade Union Organizations Use Various Methods to Relieve Unemployed Workers"
    (3) The reason why this time the tax revenue plan of various public enterprises could be completed on schedule and in full... - April 8, Third Edition, "Zhang City Public Enterprises Complete Tax Payment"
    (4) A more appropriate method is to compile unified price standard materials within a certain range, or to have a certain department set prices uniformly, in order to reduce deviations and avoid excessive discrepancies - June 4, Second Edition, "Some Experiences in Clearing Assets in Northeast China"
    (5) Here stands rows upon rows of factories - April 8, Third Edition, "Visit to the Bohai Region Labor Education Institute"
    (6) The formulation and implementation of labor protection regulations and systems are also very weak - April 9, Second Edition, "Northeast Public Enterprises Implement Labor Protection, Welfare of 550,000 Employees Improved"
    (7) Last year, the masses of Motaisi Village, five li south of the village - April 10, Sixth Edition, "Barren Mountain Turned into Pine Mountain"
    (8) This fully demonstrates that these comrades do not pay enough attention to using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to correct shortcomings in their work - April 10, First Edition, "Northeast People's Government Supervision Committee Handles Demolition Incident in Mishan County"
    (9) This shows that the leading cadres of the factory are trying to jump out of the circle of pragmatism - April 20, First Edition, "Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant... Universally Launches Democratic Management Movement"
    (10) But compared with the current records, it is still inferior - April 20, Second Edition, "Restoring Guangdong's Sugar Industry"
    (11) The prices of several commodities are almost on par with the producing area - June 11, First Edition, "Prices Shift from Falling to Trending Stable, Situation in Wuhan Market Improves"
    (12) There are also a few factories that cut corners and seek illegal profits - June 19, Third Edition, "Industrial Bureau Guides Private Machine Iron Industry to Establish Processing Ordering Management Committee Preparatory Committee"
    There are many examples, but to save space, I can't copy more. Judging from the previous examples, every Literary Chinese element in these sentences has a spoken language equivalent. It's not that spoken language is poor and we must borrow the light of Literary Chinese. Or perhaps some think that using Literary Chinese is more economical, and that speaking in spoken language inevitably requires saying more. I say that economy is important, but it should be considered in the entire article, in each paragraph. To only try to write a few words less in a single sentence is not a good way to do it. Also, why use Literary Chinese in this part, but not in that part? This cannot be answered. Speaking of this, it can be said that casually using some Literary Chinese elements is also a kind of liberalism – not caring about the readers or listeners, writing however one pleases. I would like to persuade friends to change this kind of liberalism. We only need to remember one sentence: Think for the readers and the listeners.
    Using Literary Chinese casually without being familiar with its rules sometimes inevitably leads to errors. Here are two examples of errors.
    (13) The central part of the island is distributed by the Wuzhi Mountain range - April 21, First Edition, "Introduction to Hainan Island"
    Whenever it says "...为...所..." ("...wéi...suǒ... - ...is ... by ..."), the part before the word "为 (wéi - by)" must be the object of the verb under the word "所 (suǒ - by)". For example, a sentence in Literary Chinese says "敌军为我军所歼 (dí jūn wèi wǒ jūn suǒ jiān - the enemy army was annihilated by our army)", "敌军 (dí jūn - the enemy army)" is the object of "歼 (jiān - annihilated)". "分布 (fēn bù - distributed)" is an intransitive verb, and "岛中部 (dǎo zhōng bù - the central part of the island)" is not its object, so this sentence cannot use the form "……为……所…… (……wéi……suǒ……)". It should say "五指山脉分布于岛中部 (wǔ zhǐ shān mài fēn bù yú dǎo zhōng bù - the Wuzhi Mountain range is distributed in the central part of the island)" (which is still Literary Chinese).
    (14) My Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, on the 19th, sent a telegram to Mr. Sebald, Chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, informing him that the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnants were not qualified to participate in the Allied Council for Japan, and must be expelled from all institutions and meetings of the council. At the same time, he notified him that my Central People's Government had appointed General Zhou Shidi as the head of the Chinese delegation attending the council - June 20, Fourth Edition, "My Foreign Minister Zhou Cables Allied Council for Japan Demanding Expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek Gang's 'Representatives'"
    These two "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" are used incorrectly. According to historical custom, "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" is not used as a simple accusative. However, here it is used as a simple accusative. "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" is also used as an accusative, but there is a condition: It is also a nominative for the verb below, playing two roles at once. Let me give an example to make it easier to understand. For example, a sentence in Literary Chinese says: “嘱其以时赴会 (zhǔ qí yǐ shí fù huì - Instruct him to attend the meeting on time.)” "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" is the object of "嘱 (zhǔ - instruct)", so it is an accusative for "嘱 (zhǔ - instruct)". At the same time, "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" is also the subject of "赴会 (fù huì - attend the meeting)", so it is a nominative for "赴会 (fù huì - attend the meeting)". The words under the two "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" in example (14) are completely different from "以时赴会 (yǐ shí fù huì - attend the meeting on time)". According to Literary Chinese convention, pronouns are not needed in these two places. Replacing "其 (qí - its/his/her/their)" with "以 (yǐ - with)" and saying "通知以… (tōng zhī yǐ… - notify with…)" would be correct. Of course, if we speak frankly in spoken language, we can say "通知他… (tōng zhī tā… - notify him…)"

　　谈搀用文言成分
    叶圣陶
    这一回谈谈搀用文言成分的问题。身子不好，头胀眼酸，只能少谈些。
    为什么搀用文言成分？理由很多。咱们读过文言。咱们没有学好语言。咱们感觉现代口语贫乏，好像不够用。咱们分不清文言跟现代口语的界限。还有其他。
    可是一般的读者未必全读过文言。他们的语言训练也许比咱们好，说来又纯粹，又不感觉贫乏。凭他们的语言习惯看咱们的夹七夹八的东西，即使不至于不能了解，至少感觉不怎么亲切似的。
    还有，现在报上的材料有很多要从电台上广播出去，要在读报小组里由一个人念给大家听。为了照顾听众，第一要避免噜苏的繁复的语句，第二要尽量少用文言成分。像近来差不多每天可以看见的“日趋好转”，一个“日”一个“趋”就是文言成分；还有，近来天天可以看见用作连词的“则”字，这是从文言来的，必须熟悉文言的语调（不是口语的语调），才能了解。对于这些个，咱们自己是太熟悉了，可是能够保证听的人听得真吗？（如果用拼音文字来写，这些个成分过了一天半天，连作者自己也要认不清了。）
    现在举一些例子在后面，请读者从看下去听下去两方面想：看下去是不是有点异样？听下去是不是有点不顺耳？
    （一）经过反复宣传，与中共支部党员、各行业能手的带动……——四月五日第二版《宁、宝重灾区战胜冬荒》
    （二）该市行将有三十四万多失业工人参加浚河……——六月十九日第三版《各地人民政府和工会组织用多种方式救济失业工人》
    （三）此次各公营企业税收计划之所以能按期如数完成——四月八日第三版《张市公营企业完成纳税》
    （四）比较适当的方法是编制一定范围的统一价格标准材料，或由一定部门统一作价，才能减少偏差，避免过分悬殊——六月四日第二版《东北清理资产的几点经验》
    （五）这里林立着一座座的工厂——四月八日第三版《渤海区劳动教育所访问记》
    （六）劳动保护规程和制度的制订和执行，也是非常不力的——四月九日第二版《东北公营企业实行劳动保护，五十五万职工福利改进》
    （七）去年南距该村五里的莫台寺村群众——四月十日第六版《荒山变成了松山》
    （八）这就充分的表现了这些同志对于运用批评与自我批评的武器改正工作缺点的重视之不足——四月十日第一版《东北人民政府监察委员会处理密山县拆房事件》
    （九）说明该厂领导干部力图跳出事务主义圈子——四月二十日第一版《石景山钢铁厂……普遍开展民主管理运动》
    （十）但与现在的记录比较，依然是逊色的——四月二十日第二版《恢复中的广东糖业》
    （十一）有数种商品的价格几与产区持平——六月十一日第一版《物价由落转趋平稳，武汉市场情况好转》
    （十二）还有少数工厂则偷工减料牟取非法利润——六月十九日第三版《工业局指导私营机器铁工业成立加工订货管委会筹备会》
    例子是很多的，节省篇幅，不能多抄。就前面的例子来看，这些语句里的文言成分个个都有口语的说法，并不是口语贫乏，非借文言的光不可。或者以为用文言可以经济些，说口语必然说得多。我说经济是要讲的，可是应该就通篇讲，就一段一段讲，单在一句里打算少写几个字，那是讲不好的。还有，为什么这一部分用文言，那一部分又不用呢？这是答不上来的。说到这儿，可以说随便用些个文言成分也是一种自由主义——不照顾看的人听的人，自己爱怎么写就怎么写。我想劝朋友们改变这种自由主义，咱们只要记住一句话：为看的人听的人着想。
    随便用文言又不熟悉文言的规律，有时就不免发生错误。举两个错误的例子在这儿。
    （十三）岛中部为五指山脉所分布——四月二十一日第一版《海南岛介绍》
    凡是说“…为…所…”“为”字前头的部分必然是“所”字底下的动词的对象。譬如一句文言说“敌军为我军所歼”，“敌军”是“歼”的对象。“分布”是个自动词，“岛中部”不是它的对象，所以这一句话是不能采用“……为……所……”的方式的，应该说“五指山脉分布于岛中部”（还是文言）。
    （十四）我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长，于十九日致电盟国对日管制委员会主席赛鲍尔，通知其国民党反动派残余集团的所谓“代表”没有参加对日管制委员会的资格，必须将他们从该委员会的各项机构和会议中驱逐出去，同时通知其我中央人民政府已任命周士第将军为出席该委员会中国代表团团长——六月二十日第四版《我周外长电盟国对日管委会要求驱逐蒋匪帮“代表”》
    这两个“其”是用错的。历来的习惯，“其”不作单纯的受格用，这儿却作单纯的受格用了。“其”也作受格用，可是有个条件：对于底下的动词它又是主格，它一身充两役。举个例子来说容易明白些。譬如一句文言说：“嘱其以时赴会”。“其”是“嘱”的对象，对于“嘱”是受格，同时，“其”又是“赴会”的主体，对于“赴会”是主格。（十四）例两个“其”字底下的话可跟“以时赴会”完全不相类。照文言惯例，这两处也不需用代名词，把“其”换成“以”，作“通知以……”就成了。如果爽脆说口语，当然不妨说“通知他……”。
