Clearing Up Registration, Valuation, and Summarization Issues in State-Owned Enterprise Assets
Yu Xiaogu

In the asset clearance work of state-owned enterprises, in addition to the generally necessary organizational leadership work, "registration," "valuation," and "summarization" are important links. The degree to which these tasks are done well seriously affects the effectiveness of the entire work. What is described in this article is a bit of experience gained in the process of exploring asset clearance work in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, sorted out and provided for reference.

	First, the issue of asset registration

The assets of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China are huge and complex, and there are many types of production equipment, raw materials, and products. Especially in terms of production equipment, due to the relationship between relocation and damage in the many years of war, the situation of consumption is even more complex (for example, many machines are repaired and pieced together, or have been used beyond the theoretically prescribed age, or the degree of durability and the years used are unknown, etc.). At the beginning of the asset clearance work, because the leading organs at all levels generally lacked experience in this area, and lacked appropriate regulations on the purpose and content of various asset registrations in advance, the registration results everywhere have serious phenomena of being not detailed, not specific, and not unified. For example: taking electric motors as an example, there are differences in type, high voltage and low voltage, number of poles, horsepower, place of origin, etc. As far as the current situation in Northeast China is concerned, there are more than one hundred types of differences in size. If you add different usable years in various different types, the difference will be even greater, and these distinctions determine the difference in asset value and production capacity. However, when registering, most companies simply register "electric motors, so many units." Those that do a better job only distinguish different horsepower or indicate the place of origin. The registration of buildings is also mostly not specifically distinguished by the nature of the building (such as reinforced concrete, brick and tile, wood, iron, etc.), use (such as factories, warehouses, dormitories, offices, etc.), usable years (general durable years, years used, remaining usable years), quantity (some have quantity, but the units of calculation are inconsistent, such as cubic meters, square meters, rooms, buildings, etc.). Only a simple registration of so many buildings, so many rooms, or so many cubic meters is done. Or, although the nature of the building is distinguished, there is generally no distinction between different grades of the same type (such as the same reinforced concrete construction, but the difference in quality is still very large). Also, because there is no uniform regulation or the responsible registration staff are not familiar with the assets, the same assets are registered as various different names in different enterprises, etc. These deviations have caused great difficulties in the work of "valuation," "summarization," and "audit." The leaders also cannot understand and grasp the overall picture of the enterprise's assets from the results of the clearance work. Therefore, we believe that before starting the clearance work, the following main preparations and precautions must be taken for the asset registration work:

1.  "Fixed Asset Registration Card": For general enterprises, fixed assets account for a large proportion of the total assets (according to the preliminary summary of asset clearance in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, it accounts for about 80%). These assets are also large and complex, so it is necessary to use detailed "registration cards" when clearing and registering. The purpose of the registration card is to create a table of the various asset registration purposes and content required by the leadership, so that the following registration of various assets has something to follow. At the same time, it has a more important role in the daily work of enterprise asset management in the future. However, due to the different assets of various enterprises, the "registration card" cannot be completely unified. Generally, it is more appropriate for the professional leading organs to uniformly formulate "registration cards" that meet the asset conditions of the system (such as textile factories by the Textile Administration Bureau, coal mines by the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, and railway systems by the Railway General Administration).

2.  For certain assets that are impossible or unnecessary to register with registration cards (such as current assets, or low-priced assets in fixed assets), appropriate forms or specific instructions must also be specified so that the registration can be as specific and unified as possible. The registration content of this type of asset generally includes asset name, specifications, unit of calculation (such as buildings, generally square meters should be used as the unit of calculation, and it cannot be calculated in a general way by building or room), unit price, source of assets (received or purchased, etc.), and distinction between use, spare, or safekeeping. If it belongs to fixed assets, it should also indicate the degree of consumption (durable years, years used, remaining usable years). If there are property rights disputes, the property rights relationship should be indicated.

3.  Because the assets of state-owned enterprises are huge, and most of the clearance and registration work must be carried out during production, therefore, during the clearance and registration, efforts must be made to carry out the assets in circulation, such as raw materials and products in production, in a highly comprehensive and simultaneous manner. Complete supplementary registration and settlement methods must be established for goods in transit and external claims and debts. Fixed assets or spare assets (such as independently preserved materials that are not used at any time during the clearance), if manpower is insufficient, can be cleared and registered in batches in a step-by-step manner, but it is advisable not to delay the time for too long, otherwise it is easy to produce the problem of omissions or repetitions during registration.

4.  During the asset clearance and registration process (preferably before the start of the clearance), a comprehensive and thorough asset custody, dispatch, and accounting system should be prepared immediately, so that the changes in assets after the clearance and registration can be expressed in a timely and correct manner, and the temporary clearance work can be combined with the regular management work.

5.  Due to the complexity of the assets, or the incompleteness of the asset archive materials, or the resignation of the managers, or the new managers are not familiar with the assets, it is possible that the situation of not understanding certain assets may occur during the clearance and registration. When this situation occurs, a realistic attitude must be adopted. If you don’t understand, you don’t understand. Don’t assume or fabricate, don’t think it’s probably something and register it as something (this phenomenon has occurred in asset clearance in Northeast China). You must try to identify and clarify it before formally registering it, so as not to confuse the true appearance of the assets.

	Second, the issue of asset valuation

In the asset clearance of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, the issue of valuation is relatively difficult to solve appropriately, mainly due to the complexity of the consumption situation of production equipment, the lack of market prices for many assets in the local area, or the fact that the market prices are not entirely reasonable even if there are market prices. Therefore, in order to achieve a more accurate valuation, it is necessary to properly solve the two issues of valuation basis and valuation method:

1.  The basis for valuation is generally based on or with reference to local market prices; for those without local market prices, it is based on or with reference to the prices of other major domestic markets, or calculated the current value according to the original price (such as the price of the house when it was built), or calculated with reference to the value of new manufacturing, etc.; for old assets that have been consumed, mainly production equipment such as machines and houses, the value of their consumption must be removed. However, because these bases contain assumptions and unreasonable factors to some extent, the accuracy is still problematic.

2.  Appropriate valuation methods can make up for the inaccuracies in the valuation basis. Therefore, the issue of valuation methods should be given attention. According to preliminary experience in the exploration, a more effective method is to compile a unified price standard within a certain range, or to have the leading departments within a certain range uniformly value them. This can achieve the following effects: (A) The compilation of a unified price standard or unified valuation is bound to be a work of processing and sorting out materials and opinions from all parties before the event, so it is possible to reduce deviations and increase accuracy from the centralized sorting out. (B) To make the valuation consistent or relatively consistent, and to reduce excessive disparity. In the asset clearance of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, there have been many examples of the same asset being valued several times or even more than ten times differently as a result of their own valuation. (C) Save time, manpower and material resources. In the asset clearance in Northeast China, there have also been many examples of re-working due to deviations in the results of their own valuation, with one factory and mine wasting dozens of people, months of time, and hundreds of millions of yuan worth of paper, etc. The method of compiling unified prices is generally compiled level by level from bottom to top by different enterprises. The specifications of the products should be as specific and detailed as possible.

The method of unified valuation is a supplementary method when it is impossible to compile unified price materials, and it is also limited to the common assets of the same system. For example, in the Northeast Railway General Administration, during asset clearance, there were unified prices for current assets, but no unified prices were formulated for fixed assets. Therefore, the bureau stipulated that the current assets should be cleared, registered, and valued by each unit according to the unified prices, and the fixed assets should only be cleared and registered by each unit, and the general bureau would draw relevant personnel from all levels to conduct centralized research and unified valuation. For example, in the coal mine system, the main assets that are common in each mine can be uniformly valued by the Coal Mine Administration Bureau by drawing relevant personnel from each mine.

	Third, the issue of summarization

If the summarization work of the cleared registration materials is not done well, it will also seriously affect the leadership's review of the clearance valuation, and the understanding and grasp of the actual situation of the assets. Therefore, the following two points should be noted:

1.  Before the event, there should be a unified asset (accounting) subject within a certain range, and summary tables, so that they can appropriately express different asset items and contents. The regulations of the summary table should not be too simple. For example, the first summary table of the Northeast Railway General Administration only showed the number of locomotives and the price in the locomotive item. This makes it impossible for the leadership to understand the details of the assets, and there is a lack of basis for valuation review. Generally speaking, the summary table should be able to express different asset natures (fixed assets and current assets, production assets and non-production assets, assets in use and spare or safekeeping assets, etc.), names, specifications (should be detailed and specific), durable years and availability (referring to fixed assets or other old assets), quantity, unit price, etc.

2.  In addition to the fact that the grassroots asset clearance units are required to prepare reports based on the asset clearance registration materials (such as registration cards), whether the leading units at all levels need to add summaries should be specifically stipulated according to the nature of the enterprise. For example, in the railway system, although there are many branch units at different levels, the nature and items of the assets are the same, so they should be compiled level by level (to the General Administration), so that there are not only asset materials from different regions and different units, but also materials that centrally express the asset status of the entire railway system, so that the leadership can easily understand and grasp them. Conversely, if the industrial and commercial systems have a large comprehensive nature of production and assets, it is impossible or unnecessary for the Ministry of Industry or the Ministry of Commerce to summarize them, but it is sufficient for the professional bureaus or companies under the ministry to summarize them. Special or large-scale factories and mines, or can not add summaries, so that their independent performance is better.

Although the asset clearance work of state-owned enterprises is a new and complex work, if there is correct organization and leadership, and the actual work of registration, valuation, and summarization can be handled appropriately, then it is not very difficult to successfully complete the task and gain certain results. However, it is impossible to achieve a completely thorough inventory and a completely accurate valuation in one clearance work. For this kind of clearance valuation work that cannot be completed accurately for a while, it should be studied and corrected at any time in the regular management work after the asset clearance. Therefore, it is repeatedly proposed that specific and thorough asset management systems should be prepared before or during the clearance work, so that the changes in assets after the clearance can be expressed in a timely and correct manner, and the method of closely combining the temporary clearance work with the regular management work should be well valued and implemented.

　　清理公营企业资产中的登记作价和汇总问题
    余啸谷
    公营企业资产清理工作，除一般必须的组织领导工作外，“登记”、“作价”、“汇总”等几项工作，都是重要环节。这些工作做得好坏的程度，严重地影响着整个工作的效果。本文所述，是东北国营企业资产清理工作摸索过程中所得到的点滴经验，加整理，提供参考。
            第一、资产登记问题
    东北公营企业资产庞大而复杂，生产设备、原材料、产品的种类繁多。尤以生产设备方面，在多年战争环境中，搬移与遭受破坏关系，耗损情况，更形复杂（如有不少机器是修理拼凑起来的，或者使用已超过理论上规定的年龄，或者不知耐用程度与已用年限等）。在资产清理工作开始时，因各级领导机关大多缺乏这方面的经验，对各种资产登记之目的与内容，事先缺少适当的规定，致登记结果，到处存在着不详尽、不具体、不统一的严重现象。例如：以电动机而论，类型，高压低压，极数，马力，出产地等都有区别，以东北现在情况来说，大小差异有一百多种类以上，如加上各种不同种类中的不同可用年限，区别就更多，而这些区分，都决定其资产价值与生产能力的差异，但各企业登记时，多数仅是简单的登记“电动机若干台”，作得较好的，也仅区分不同马力，或说明出产地而已。对建筑物的登记，也多未具体区分建筑物的性质（如钢骨水泥造，砖瓦造，木造，铁造等）、用途（如工场、仓库、宿舍、办公室等）、可用年限（一般耐用年限、已用年数、尚可使用年限）、数量（有的虽有数量，但计算单位不一致，如有立方米，平方米，间，幢等）。只简单的登记房屋若干幢，若干间，或若干立方米，或虽区分了建筑物性质，但对同类中之不同等级（如同样是钢骨水泥造，但好坏等级相差仍很大），一般均无区分。又如，因无统一规定或负责登记工作人员对资产不熟识，致同一样的资产，在不同的企业，登记成各种不同的名称等。这些偏差，造成“作价”、“汇总”、“审核”工作上的很大困难，领导上也无法从清理工作的结果达到了解与掌握企业资产的全貌。因此我们认为在开始清理工作之前，对资产登记这一项工作，须有如下几项主要的准备工作和注意事项：
    １、“固定资产登记卡片”：就一般企业来说，固定资产在全部资产中占很大的比重（根据东北公营企业资产清理的初步总结，约占百分之八十左右）。这些资产，又是较大宗的和复杂的，因此清理登记时采用详细“登记卡片”是很必要的。登记卡片的目的，是把领导上要求各种资产登记的目的和内容制成表式，使下面登记各项资产时有所遵循，同时，对今后企业资产管理的经常工作上更有重要作用。但由于各种企业资产的不同，“登记卡片”不可能完全统一，一般的由各专业领导机关统一规定合乎本系统资产情况的“登记卡片”较为合适（如纺织厂由纺织管理局，煤矿由煤矿管理局，铁路系统由铁路总局制定这种卡片）。
    ２、某些资产，如不可能或不须要登记卡片者，（如流动资产，或固定资产中之低价资产）也必须规定适当表格或具体指示，使登记时尽量达到具体与统一。此种资产的登记内容一般地应包括资产名称、规格、计算单位（如建筑物，一般的应以平方米作计算单位为合适，不能笼统以栋、间计算）、单价、资产来源（接收或自购等）、使用和备用或代保管的区分等，如属固定资产，并应表明耗损程度（耐用年限、已用年限、尚可使用年限），如有产权纠葛者，应表明产权关系等。
    ３、由于公营企业资产庞大，而清理登记工作绝大部分必须在生产进行中进行，故清理登记时，对于生产中的原材料，产品等周转中的资产，必须争取高度地全面地同时进行，对运输中的货物与对外债权债务，均须定出周密的补登与结算办法。固定资产或备用资产（如独立保存，非清理中随时使用之物资），如人力不及，当可有步骤分批清理登记，但也以不使时间拖延过长为宜，否则容易产生登记时遗漏或重复的毛病。
    ４、在资产清理登记过程中（最好是开始清理之前），应即准备全面和周密的资产保管、收发、会计制度，使清理登记后之资产变化，能及时而正确的表现，使一时的清理工作与经常的管理工作结合。
    ５、由于资产的复杂，或资产档案材料的不全，或经管人员离职、新管人员对资产不熟，清理登记中，可能发生对某些资产不明白的情况。对这种情况发生时，一定要采取实事求是的态度，不懂就是不懂，不要假定、杜撰、不要以为大概是什么就登记为什么（东北资产清理中，这种现象是发生过的），一定要想办法鉴别，弄清楚后再正式登记，以免混淆资产真貌。
            第二、资产作价问题
    东北国营企业资产清理中，作价问题是一个比较难以适当解决的，主要由于生产设备耗损情况的复杂，许多资产当地缺乏市价，或虽有市价而不尽合理。因此为达到比较准确的作价，必须适当解决作价根据与作价方法两个问题：
    １、作价根据，一般的依照或参考当地市价；当地无市价者依照或参考国内其他主要市场价格，或按原始价格（如房屋指建筑时之价格）求现值，或参考新制价值计算等方法；对于已有耗损的旧资产，主要为机器房屋等生产设备，均须除去其耗损部分之价值。但因这些根据多少都含有假定与不尽合理的因素，故准确程度仍有问题。
    ２、适当的作价方法，可以弥补作价根据上不尽准确的缺憾。所以对作价方法问题，应予重视。据摸索中的初步经验，比较有效的方法，是编制一定范围的统一价格标准，或由一定范围领导部门统一作价，这样可以获致下列一些效用：（甲）编制统一价格标准或统一作价，都必然是事前集中各方材料和意见的加工整理工作，因而可能从集中整理中减少偏差，增加准确程度。（乙）使作价达到一致，或比较一致，减免过分悬殊。东北国营企业资产清理中，曾因各自估价的结果，发生同一样资产作价相差几倍以至十几倍的例子很多。（丙）节省时间，人力和物力。东北资产清理中，也曾因各自作价结果的偏差，重新翻工，一个厂矿浪费几十人，成月时间，几亿元价值的纸张等例子很多。统一价格的编制方法，一般地按不同企业自下而上，逐级审查汇编。对产品规格，应尽量求得具体详尽为宜。
    统一作价的方法，是作为不可能编制统一价格材料时的补助方法，也只限用于同一系统的共同资产上，如东北铁路总局，资产清理时，流动资产方面已有统一价格，固定资产方面则未制定统一价格，故该局规定：流动资产方面由各单位负责清理、登记、并按统一价格作价，固定资产方面，各单位仅负责清理、登记，由总局抽调各级有关人员集中研究，统一作价。又如煤矿系统，各矿中共同性的主要资产，可由煤矿管理局抽调各矿有关人员统一作价。
            第三、汇总问题
    清理登记材料的汇总工作如未做好，也将严重的影响领导上对清理作价等的审核，与对资产实况的了解和掌握。故应注意下列两点：
    １、事前应有一定范围的统一资产（会计）科目，与汇总表格，使之适当表现不同的资产项目和内容。汇总表格的规定，不宜太简单，例如东北铁路总局第一次的汇总表格，机车一项，仅表现机车若干台，价格若干元。这样使领导上，即无法了解资产详况，对估价审核也缺乏根据。一般地说，汇总表格，应能表现出不同的资产性质（固定资产与流动资产、生产资产与非生产资产、使用中资产与备用或代保管资产等）、名称、规格（应详尽具体）、耐用年限与可用程度（指固定资产或其他旧资产方面）、数量、单价等。
    ２、除基层资产清理单位，均需根据资产清理登记之材料（如登记卡片）编制表报外，各级领导单位，是否须加汇总，应视企业性质具体规定，如铁路系统，虽分支单位层级很多，但资产性质，项目相同，故应逐级（至总局）汇编，使之不仅有不同地区不同单位之资产材料，并有集中表现整个铁路系统资产状况的材料，使领导上易于了解与掌握。反之，如工业、商业系统，生产与资产综合性大，则不可能或不需要由工业部，商业部汇总，而由部属之专业局或公司汇总即可。特殊或规模大的厂矿，或可不加汇总，使其独立表现更好。
    公营企业资产清理工作，虽然是一件新而复杂的工作，但如有了正确的组织领导，以及登记、作价、汇总几项实际工作能适当处理，那末顺利完成任务，收获一定成果仍不是很困难的。但是希望在一次清理工作中，达到清点绝对彻底和作价完全准确，是不可能的。对于这种一时未能准确完成之清理估价工作，应该在资产清理后经常的管理工作中随时研究与补正。因此，重复提出，在清理工作之前或过程中即准备好具体和周密的资产管理制度，使清理后资产之变化能及时而正确的表现，一时的清理工作与经常的管理工作密切结合的办法，应很好重视和切实做到。
