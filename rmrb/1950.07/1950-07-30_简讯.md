    The Tianjin Department Store has established a flood prevention team and has made thorough plans and arrangements. The first emphasis is on warehouse management: re-inspecting stored goods for dampness and mold, checking warehouses for leaks and dampness, ensuring yard drains are not blocked, and strengthening and improving storage techniques. In addition, the company's building is in a low-lying area. To ensure safety during the flood season, each floor has now assigned dedicated personnel responsible for defense.

    Beijing Xizhimen Station Management Committee Does Good Work
    The Tianjin Railway Administration's Beijing Branch, Xizhimen Station Management Committee, has achieved excellent results. To promote the station's experience, the Tianjin Railway Bureau organized cadres from major stations of various branches to visit. The station's management committee holds three regular meetings each month. The focus of discussion is announced before the meeting so that each member can go into the masses to absorb opinions. Due to thorough preparation, discussions are compact and can solve problems satisfactorily. Ordinary employees can attend each meeting as observers, and if they have opinions, they can submit them to the workers' representative assembly. The resolutions of the management committee are also implemented after being reviewed by the workers' representative assembly, thus making the work of the management committee closely integrated with the masses. According to the needs of the work, the station's administrative leaders also make calls to all employees at any time; the Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League closely cooperate. These are the main reasons why the station can truly implement democratic management. (Guo Zecheng)

    天津铁路管理局北京分局西直门车站管委会工作成绩很好。为推广该站的经验，天津路局曾组织各分局主要站的干部，前往参观。该站管委会每月有三次例会，会前均公布讨论中心，使各委员可以深入群众吸收意见，由于准备充分，讨论时既紧凑又能圆满解决问题。每次例会，一般职工均可列席旁听，如有意见，可提交工代会。管委会的决议案也是经过工代会审查后施行，因此使管委会工作密切与群众相结合。根据工作的需要，该站行政领导，也随时向全体职工提出号召；党、工、团密切配合。这些都是该站所以能真正贯彻管理民主化的主要原因。（郭则诚）
