Summer Hoeing in North China Enters a Tense Stage
	Careful and Meticulous Hoeing Leads to Vigorous Crop Growth
	[Our Dispatch] Summer hoeing work in various parts of North China has entered a tense stage. In Hebei Province, millet, sorghum, and corn have generally been hoeed three times; late-sown crops have been hoeed once; and the four hoeings for 14 million mu of cotton are nearing completion. In Shanxi Province, the first hoeing has been completed for 35 million mu of autumn crops, and the second hoeing is now underway; Jincheng and other counties, which started earlier, have begun the third hoeing. The 1.5 million mu of cotton fields in southern Shanxi have also been hoeed three times. In Pingyuan Province, the general cotton fields of more than 4 million mu have been hoeed three to four times; the late-sown seedlings on wheat stubble have mostly emerged, and some have begun their first hoeing. In Chahar Province, hoeing started earlier than in previous years, and the second hoeing of field crops is nearing completion, with some areas beginning the third hoeing. Due to the colder climate and later sowing, the autumn seedlings in Suiyuan Province have also entered the second hoeing.
	This year, rainfall has been sufficient in most areas, and more fertilizer has been applied before sowing, with attention paid to soaking and mixing seeds. After the seedlings emerged, prevention and control of pests and diseases were carried out along with timely hoeing and weeding, resulting in very vigorous crop growth. In Hebei Province, cotton seedlings have grown to more than two chi (Chinese feet) tall, with most flowering and producing bolls; millet has grown to more than three chi tall, and sorghum and corn have grown to more than five chi tall. In Shanxi Province, corn has grown taller than the knee, rice is about one chi tall, and the seedlings are robust. Farmers everywhere are overjoyed.
	Extensively Organize Labor Exchange and Mutual Assistance
	Universally Mobilize Women to Go to the Fields
	The extensive organization of labor exchange and mutual assistance and the universal mobilization of women to go to the fields are two major characteristics of this year's summer hoeing in various parts of North China. In Hebei Province, labor exchange and mutual assistance organizations have greatly developed during the summer hoeing. For example, in the first district of Qinghe County, there were originally 170 mutual aid teams, and 106 new ones were organized during the summer hoeing. In Hunyuan, Datong, and three other counties in Chahar Province, more than 6,800 labor exchange groups have been organized, with more than 27,000 participating farmers. Thanks to the organization of mutual assistance, the time for hoeing seedlings has been shortened, and both summer harvesting and summer hoeing have been ensured. For example, in Dongyuan Village, Yanggao County, 490 mu of fields used to take more than 20 days to hoe once, but this year it took only 10 days. In Shanxi Province, some of the autumn seedlings in 47 counties were replanted after suffering from frost and hail damage, so emergence was uneven, and summer harvesting and summer hoeing were intertwined, making hoeing work particularly tense. After extensively organizing mutual assistance and mobilizing women to go to the fields, both summer harvesting and summer hoeing were finally ensured.
	This year, more women are participating in field work than ever before. According to statistics from ten old revolutionary base counties in Shanxi, such as Jincheng and Zuoquan, the average participation rate of women in summer hoeing accounts for 70 percent of the local female labor force, both full and part-time; some villages reach 90 to 95 percent. Women in the new areas, who previously had little experience in field work, have also actively participated in hoeing. For example, women participating in hoeing in five counties, such as Yuci and Fenyang, account for 40 percent of the total. In Yanqing and other places in Chahar, the participation rate in hoeing has also reached more than 90 percent. The participation of women in summer hoeing in Suiyuan Province has freed up a significant number of male laborers to spend time on dike repairs.
	Pay Attention to Improving Hoeing Techniques
	Large Amounts of Topdressing Fertilizer Applied in Various Places
	In addition, various places have also paid attention to improving hoeing techniques and applying topdressing fertilizer during the summer hoeing. In Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, timely slogans were put forward during hoeing, such as "Hoeing seedlings is like applying manure," "Sparse millet yields large ears," and "First hoeing for seedlings, second hoeing for weeds, third hoeing to heap soil to seal the roots," breaking the farmers' old habits of "hoeing only once before wheat harvest" and "ten ears are equal to one ear, purely earning nine bundles of firewood." In Licheng, Wuxiang, Lucheng, and other counties in Shanxi, thinning dense seedlings and retaining even ones were also promoted. Regarding topdressing fertilizer, according to statistics from five districts and eleven villages in Changping and Tong counties, Hebei Province, 264,000 mu of land were topdressed, with an average of four loads per mu. The Tangshan Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Tianjin Prefecture Branch of the People's Bank also adjusted and lent more than 13 million jin of bean cake and more than 3.7 million jin of fertilizer to farmers, solving the fertilizer shortage.
	During the summer hoeing, leading organs at all levels in Chahar Province also dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to conduct inspections and provide guidance with a focus. The provincial People's Bank also lent 470,000 jin of grain; the supply and marketing cooperatives also organized blacksmith shops to manufacture and sell agricultural implements to farmers at low prices, solving the shortage of agricultural implements during the summer hoeing. The people's governments of Shouyang, Yangcheng, and other counties in Shanxi, and Wudong, Fengzhen, and other counties in Suiyuan, also organized cadres to go to the countryside to inspect, correct the tendency of some cadres to neglect the leadership of summer hoeing, and promote the summer hoeing work.

　　华北夏锄进入紧张阶段
    作到精耕细锄禾苗生长旺盛
    【本报讯】华北各地锄苗工作已进入紧张阶段。河北省谷子、高粱、玉米已普遍锄过三遍；晚种作物锄过头遍；一千四百万亩棉花四遍即将锄完。山西省三千五百万亩秋禾已锄过头遍，现正进入二锄；动手较早的晋城等县已开始锄第三遍。晋南一百五十万亩棉田也已经锄过三遍。平原省四百多万亩棉田，一般已锄到三至四遍；麦茬晚苗也大部出土，有的开始锄头遍。察哈尔省开锄较往年为早，大田作物二遍已快锄完，个别地区已开始锄第三遍。因气候较冷，播种较晚的绥远省秋苗，也已进入二锄。
    今年大部地区雨量充足，播种前多施了肥料并注意了浸种、拌种，禾苗出土后又做到防治病虫害与及时锄耪，所以作物成长十分旺盛。河北省棉苗已长到二尺多高，大部在开花结桃，谷子长到三尺多高，高粱、玉茭已长到五尺多高。山西省玉茭已高过膝，稻子尺许，禾苗茁壮。各地农民都欣喜万分。
    广泛组织变工互助
    普遍动员妇女下地
    广泛地组织变工互助和普遍地动员妇女下地，是今年华北各地夏锄中的两大特点。河北省各地的变工互助组织，在夏锄中有了很大的发展。如清河县一区，原有一百七十个互助组，夏锄中又新组织起一百零六个。察哈尔省浑源、大同等五县，组织起来的拨工组就有六千八百多个，参加的农民有二万七千多人。各地由于组织了互助，不仅缩短了锄苗时间，并且做到了夏收夏锄两不误。如阳高县东圆村四百九十亩大田，去年要花二十多天才锄完一遍，今年十天就锄完了。山西省曾有四十七县的部分秋苗是遭受冻灾、雹灾后补种的，所以出土不一，夏收夏锄交错在一起，锄苗工作特别紧张，经过广泛组织互助和发动妇女下地后，终于做到了夏收、夏锄两不误。
    今年夏锄中，各地妇女下地更为普遍。据山西老区晋城、左权等十县统计，参加夏锄的妇女，平均占当地妇女全劳动力、半劳动力的百分之七十；有的村庄达到百分之九十到九十五以上。新区妇女过去多无下地习惯，今年也纷纷参加了锄苗。如榆次、汾阳等五县下地锄苗的妇女，即占总数的百分之四十。察哈尔延庆等地参加锄苗的也达百分之九十以上。绥远省妇女参加夏锄的结果，使不少男劳动力得以抽出时间进行修堤。
    注意改进锄苗技术
    各地大量补上追肥
    此外，夏锄中各地还注意了锄苗技术的提高与上追肥。河北省邯郸专区在锄苗中，及时的提出了“苗锄好比上粪”、“稀谷锈大穗”、“头遍锄苗二遍草、三遍拥土根封严”等口号，打破了农民的“麦前只锄一遍”、“十穗顶一穗，净赚九根柴”的旧习惯。山西黎城、武乡、潞城等县亦提倡了改稠留稀、锄细留匀。在上追肥方面，仅据河北省昌平、通县五个区又十一个村的统计，即有二十六万四千亩地上了追肥，平均每亩四驮。唐山专区供销社与人民银行天津专区支行，并调剂与贷放给农民一千三百多万斤豆饼，三百七十多万斤肥田粉，解决了缺肥困难。
    在夏锄中，察哈尔省各级领导机关还抽调了大批干部下乡，有重点地进行了检查和领导。该省人民银行并贷出粮食四十七万斤；各供销合作社也组织铁匠炉制造农具廉价出售给农民，解决了夏锄中缺少农具的困难。山西寿阳、阳城等县，绥远武东、丰镇等县人民政府，也在夏锄中组织干部下乡检查，纠正了部分干部忽视夏锄领导的偏向，推动了夏锄工作。
