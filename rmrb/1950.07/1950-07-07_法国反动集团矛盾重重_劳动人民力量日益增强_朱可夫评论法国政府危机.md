Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: According to TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* reporter Zhukov, in commenting on the French government crisis, pointed out that Pidault inherited almost all of his ministers from his predecessor and continued to implement anti-people and anti-national plans, which destined him for a terrible failure.

The great success of the movement demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and the struggle against military preparations proves that the French working people will never allow their country to be dragged into the war of aggression prepared by US imperialism. The scale of unity among the working people is expanding and their strength has increased. The recent elections to social insurance institutions show that the General Confederation of Labor remains the dominant force in the French trade union movement. The Communist Party has gained the sympathy of millions of people and reflects their hopes.

The bourgeois parties that make up the Pidault cabinet—the Popular Republican Movement, the right-wing Socialist Party, the Radical Party, and various small political groups—are united in their hatred of the growing democratic forces at home and the peace-democratic camp led by the Soviet Union. However, this has not eliminated the contradictions between them.

The Socialist Party congress and the Popular Republican Movement congress in May, as well as the meeting of the Radical Party's leading bodies shortly thereafter, were essentially congresses of bourgeois parties engaged in internal strife. In order to retain the remnants of their voters, the right-wing Socialist Party had to resort to means of winning over society. At the same time, they insisted on "reforming" the electoral law in order to minimize the number of Communists participating in parliament. The Popular Republicans also hoped to expel the Communists from parliament, but feared that their partners would use the "reform" of the election to oppose them.

The Pidault government did everything it could but failed to complete the tasks assigned by Washington of continuing to increase military spending, ceding the French coal and steel industry, destroying the social insurance system, and "purging" state institutions. Opposition to the government's policies by the broad masses forced the Socialist Party ministers to withdraw from the cabinet as early as February 4. However, the Socialists continued to support the Pidault government in parliament. When the Pidault cabinet was on the verge of collapse under the impact of growing popular discontent, the Socialist Party played the comedy of "irreconcilable contradictions" on the issue of civil servants' salaries, pretending to be staunch supporters of the people's interests in front of the voters. However, this comedy cannot fool anyone.

Currently, the right-wing parties are using the resignation of the Pidault cabinet to conspire to revise the electoral law and conduct new parliamentary elections, attempting to fill parliament with the most heinous reactionary agents. The de Gaulle elements are actively active, and one of their leaders, Debu-Bridel, a member of the Senate of the Republic, declared that the next de Gaulle party congress will be "a stormy congress that will pave the way for seizing power."

Patriots across the country are fully aware of the crisis that is once again threatening the French people, and they are rallying their ranks to resist the reactionaries. The Communist Party's re-proposed slogan of forming a democratic coalition government is their banner.

　　法国反动集团矛盾重重  劳动人民力量日益增强
    朱可夫评论法国政府危机
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报记者朱可夫在评论法国政府危机时指出：皮杜尔从前任手中继承了几乎是全体的部长，并继续执行反人民反民族的计划，这就注定了可怕的失败。
    要求禁止原子武器运动和反对军事准备斗争的巨大成功，证明法国劳动人民决不容许他们的国家被卷入美帝国主义所准备的侵略战争中。劳动人民的团结规模日益扩大，力量也已增强。最近社会保险机构的选举，显示出总工会在法国工会运动中依然是主导的力量。共产党获得了千百万人的同情并反映了他们的希望。
    组成皮杜尔内阁的资产阶级政党——人民共和党、右翼社会党、激进党和各种小政团，都团结在他们对国内日益增长的民主力量以及以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的仇恨里面。然而，这并没有能消除它们之间的矛盾。
    五月间的社会党大会和人民共和党大会以及不久以后激进党领导机构的会议，本质上都是资产阶级政党进行内争的大会。右翼社会党为保留残余的选民，不得不诉诸笼络社会的手段。同时，它们并坚持要求“改革”选举法，以便将共产党参加议会人数减至最小限度。人民共和党人也希望把共产党人逐出议会，但又害怕他们的伙伴们利用选举的“改革”来反对他们。
    皮杜尔政府曾尽一切努力但并未能完成华盛顿所交付的继续增加军费、出让法国煤钢工业、摧毁社会保险制度、“整肃”国家机构的任务。广大群众对政府政策的反对，迫使社会党的部长们早在二月四日就退出内阁。但社会党人继续在议会中支持皮杜尔政府。当皮杜尔内阁在人民日益增长的不满的冲击之下即将垮台的时候，社会党在公务员薪金问题上扮演着“不可妥协的矛盾”的喜剧，在选民面前装做人民利益坚决的拥护者。然而，这个喜剧骗不了任何人。
    目前，右翼各党正利用皮杜尔内阁的辞职，阴谋修改选举法及进行议会的新选举，企图使议会中充满着最可恶的反动派的代理人。戴高乐分子正在积极活动，他们的头目之一，共和国参议院议员戴布——勃里戴尔宣称：下届戴高乐党的大会，将是“为夺取政权铺平道路的暴风雨性的大会”。
    全国的爱国者充分觉察到那再度威胁法国人民的危机，他们正密集队伍来抵制反动派。共产党所重新提出的成立民主联合政府的口号，便是他们的旗帜。
