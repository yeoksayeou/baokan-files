　　Cui Wannian, Director of the Rolling Mill Department of Tianjin Steel Plant, Accepts Workers' Opinions to Improve Production
    [This Dispatch from Tianjin] Cui Wannian, director of the rolling mill department of Tianjin Steel Plant, pays attention to absorbing mass opinions, improving production, and caring about the masses' lives and technical learning. As a result, the department's May production exceeded the plan by 10%, the first-grade products reached 90%, exceeding the requirement by 40%, and more than 130,000 catties of millet were saved. Director Cui often goes deep into the field, researches and solves production problems together with the workers. When he heard the workers say, "Burning steel ingots cannot be done without Datong coal powder. Using coal powder from other places is wasteful, and the steel ingots are not thoroughly burnt, which can easily lead to defective products," it caught his attention. After research and verification, it was true, so he immediately asked the superiors to solve the coal burning problem. When launching the production competition, he first convened the leading cadres of the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League to jointly study and unify opinions; and through the trade unions and groups in each workshop for discussion, so that the masses reached a consensus, and on the basis of consciousness, generally formulated competition plans, thus making the production movement a mass-conscious movement. In order to avoid the tendency of pursuing quantity and damaging machines, he constantly educated workers to take good care of the machines during the competition. Taking the 1,000-horsepower automatic drop grid as an example, the machine dropped 18 times in April, but only twice in May. In order to improve the technical level of the workers, the department organized a technical training class, with engineers teaching once a week. Director Cui is also very concerned about the lives of the workers, and provides timely and appropriate solutions under possible conditions, so the workers' enthusiasm for labor is always high.

　　天津制钢厂轧钢部主任崔万年
    接受工人意见改进生产
    【本报天津讯】天津制钢厂轧钢部主任崔万年，注意吸收群众意见，改进生产，关心群众生活和技术学习，因而该部五月份生产超过计划百分之十，一级品达百分之九十，超过要求百分之四十，并节约小米十三万余斤。崔主任经常深入现场，和工友们共同研究并解决生产中的问题。当他听到工友们说：“烧钢锭没有大同煤末不行。用别处的煤末，又浪费，钢锭也烧不透，容易出废品。”便引起了他的注意。经过研究证明真实后，随即要求上级解决了烧煤的问题。在发动生产竞赛时，他首先召集党、工、团的领导干部共同研究统一意见；并通过各车间工会、小组进行讨论，使群众认识取得一致，在自觉的基础上普遍制订出竞赛计划，因而使生产运动成为群众性的自觉的运动。为了避免发生追逐数量损坏机器的偏向，在竞赛中他随时教育工人爱护机器。以一千马力的自动掉栅为例，四月份该机器掉过十八次，五月份只掉两次。为提高工友们技术水平，该部组织了技术学习班，由工程师每周上课一次。对于工友们的生活，崔主任同样也很关心，在可能的条件下，均及时适当予以解决，因而工友们的劳动热情始终是高涨的。
