Model Worker Li Xizi
　　Lü Zōng
　　Li Xizi is a vertical lathe operator in the machine workshop of the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory. He is only twenty-nine years old this year but has already been a worker for eleven years. In the first quarter of this year's production, he was elected as a first-class meritorious worker in the entire factory. In the second quarter, he was again elected as a production model for the entire factory. From the following facts, we can see his glorious model deeds.
　　1. Time for a 100-hour Job Reduced to 40 Hours
　　The Howe water pump is one of the important parts on a locomotive. In the era of the enemy and puppet regime, it took Li Xizi thirteen work shifts, or more than one hundred hours, to turn one Howe water pump. After liberation, during the Red May production competition last year, it only took sixty hours to complete the task; by the end of June this year, Li Xizi had already created a new record of completing the task in forty hours, increasing productivity by one and a half times. Moreover, the quality of the output products has also improved.
　　How did Li Xizi's production efficiency improve? Li Xizi said: "After liberation, my thinking has improved. Not only when I stand next to the machine, but even when I walk on the road or lie in bed, I always think about how to do more work. When I go to work, I always pay attention to the machine tool, always watching whether the tool is used well. Every cut must be used to its full potential, never letting the machine run idle, and not wasting a single bit of time."
　　2. Six Times Faster
　　Turning eccentric wheels used to take Li Xizi one work shift, or eight hours, to turn one in the era of the enemy and puppet regime. By January of this year, he improved the production method, and he could turn three in four hours, increasing productivity six times.
　　How did he improve the turning of eccentric wheels? He only attended elementary school for three years when he was young and had no scientific theoretical knowledge. The condition for him to improve production methods was based on his new labor attitude, his enthusiasm for loving the factory and the machines, and his familiarity with the characteristics of the machines and the production process. In the past, the method of turning eccentric wheels was to turn one side first and then turn it over to turn the other side. This was both laborious, and the work was not regular, with a lot of backhand work. After liberation, although the same method was still used, Li Xizi, due to his high production enthusiasm, could turn it well in just four hours. Productivity had already doubled compared to the enemy and puppet regime period.
　　However, Li Xizi was still not satisfied with this achievement. After discussing with other workers, he finally came up with a solution: find another sliding plate, put the eccentric wheel on the plate, and press it with a pressing plate; this eliminates the need to flip the wheel, and it can be turned in one go. The work is also more regular. After successful testing, the leadership promptly encouraged and promoted this production improvement. His method was taken to the workers for discussion, and he explained his approach, encouraging everyone to work according to the new method, which made turning much faster. Three can be turned in four hours.
　　3. Overcoming Conservative Thinking in Technology
　　Turning cylinder liners is a very precise job. In the past, during the enemy and puppet regime, turning cylinder liners required three machines and five steps, totaling forty-two hours. The highest record after liberation was also twenty-five hours. However, after Li Xizi's improvement, it now only takes fourteen hours to complete. Productivity has increased three times compared to the enemy and puppet regime period.
　　According to the old rules for turning cylinder liners in the past, it had to go through five steps. The first step was turning the rough stock, the second was scribing, the third was drilling holes, the fourth was deburring the holes, and the fifth was finish turning. Last year, Li Xizi began to figure out ways to improve the process. He thought: if the first and fifth steps could be combined for finish turning, it would not only save one step, but also the cylinder liner would be thinner after finish turning. Drilling and deburring would also save time. Li Xizi thought about it and felt that his method was not bad. He put forward this opinion as a rationalization proposal. At that time, the deputy director of the machine workshop thought: "I have never seen this done before. I am afraid that finish turning at once will make it not round and that it will leak when pressed into the cylinder...."
　　This year, the deputy director was replaced by Fan Yuqi. In March, locomotive No. 1159 was rushing to leave the factory, but the workers turning the cylinder liners made a mistake, and it had to be redone. In this emergency, the Party branch secretary asked Li Xizi to help with this task. At this time, Li Xizi again proposed his past idea, which was approved by the deputy director at the time. The test results showed that the task that used to take twenty-five hours was completed in only sixteen hours. Now, Li Xizi uses the new method to further shorten the time from sixteen hours to fourteen hours.
　　Young model worker Li Xizi, with the creative behavior of the working class, has tripled and sextupled productivity in his work post, becoming a glorious banner of the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory.

　　模范工人李喜子
    旅踪
    李喜子是石家庄铁路工厂机工所一个立旋工匠，今年才二十九岁，却已当了十一年工人。今年第一季生产中，他当选全厂一等功臣。第二季又当选全厂生产模范。从下面的事实，可以看到他的光辉的模范事迹。
    一、一百小时的活，缩短到四十小时
    华式水泵是机车上重要机件之一。李喜子在敌伪时代旋一个华式水泵，得花十三个工，即一百小时以上。解放后，在去年红五月生产竞赛时，只要六十小时就干完了；到今年六月底，李喜子已经创造了四十小时完成任务的新纪录，使生产力提高了一倍半。并且，出产品的质量也提高了。
    李喜子的生产效率怎样会提高的呢？李喜子说：“解放后，思想进步了。不要说人站在机器旁边的时候，就是走在道上，躺在床上，总是想怎样能多干活。一上班更是时刻注意到机器旋刀，随时在看着刀用得好不好。刀刀都要用在劲头上，总不让机器跑空，不浪费一点点时间。”
    二、快了六倍
    旋偏心轮这个活儿，过去在敌伪时代，李喜子旋一个得花一个工，合八小时。到今年一月，他改进了生产方法，四小时就可以旋三个，生产力提高了六倍。
    他怎样改进旋偏心轮的呢？他自幼只读过三年小学，也没有科学理论知识。他改进生产方法的条件，就凭他新的劳动态度，就凭他爱工厂、爱机器的热忱，就凭他熟悉机器的性格和生产过程。过去旋偏心轮的方法，先旋完一面，再翻过来旋另一面，这样既费了劲，旋出来的活儿还不规矩，反手活儿也多。解放后，虽然还是那么做法，李喜子因自己高度的生产积极性，只要四小时就旋好了。比敌伪时期生产力已提高了一倍。
    但是，李喜子总还不满足这个成绩，经他找其他工友商量，他终于想出了办法：就是另找一个滑盘，把偏心轮放在盘上，用压板压住；这样就不用翻面，一道手就旋完了。做出的活又规矩。经过试验成功后，领导上及时鼓励和推动了这个生产上的改进。他的办法就拿到工友中讨论，并解释他的做法，带动大家按新办法干起来，这样旋起来就快多了。四小时就可以旋三个。
    三、战胜了技术上的保守思想
    旋气室套是一个很精细的活儿，过去在敌伪时代，旋气室套用三部机器，五道手，共要四十二小时。解放后的最高纪录也要二十五小时。可是经过李喜子的改进，现在只要十四小时就完成。生产力较敌伪时代提高了三倍。
    按过去旋气室套的老规矩，都得经过五道手。第一道旋毛皮，第二道划线，第三道打眼，第四道擦眼，第五道旋光。去年李喜子就开始捉摸改进的办法，他想：如把第一道手和第五道手合成一下旋光，不仅省了一道手，而且经过旋光后，气室套就薄了。打眼、擦眼也就省了时间。李喜子想来想去，总觉自己的办法不坏。就把这个意见，当做一个合理化建议提出来了。当时机工所副主任却认为：“以前没有见这样做过，怕一下旋光就不圆了，怕压到汽缸里漏气……。”
    今年，副主任换了樊玉岐，三月间，一一五九号机车赶着要出厂，可是旋气室套的工友做错了活，要重新做过。在这样紧急情况下，党支部书记就要李喜子来帮忙突击这个任务。这时李喜子又提出自己过去想出的办法，当时得到了副主任的批准，试验结果，过去二十五小时的活，只用十六小时就把任务完成了。现在李喜子用新办法，由十六小时又缩短到十四小时。
    青年模范工人李喜子，以工人阶级的创造行为，在自己的工作岗位上，三倍、六倍的提高了生产力，成为石家庄铁路工厂的一面光辉的旗帜。
