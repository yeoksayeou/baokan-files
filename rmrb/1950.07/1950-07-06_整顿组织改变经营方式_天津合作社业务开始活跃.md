　　Organizational Rectification and Changes in Business Methods
    Tianjin Cooperative Business Begins to Thrive
    [本报讯] Tianjin's consumer cooperatives have been actively rectifying their organization, investigating corruption and waste, and adapting to the new situation after price stabilization over the past six months. They have changed their bureaucratic management methods, implemented joint procurement, and developed agency purchases and sales. As a result, business has become active since June and is on the road to normal development. According to statistics at the end of 1949, Tianjin Consumer Cooperatives had 462 units (excluding the Tangda District) with 1,092,479 members, accounting for more than half of the city's population. However, because most cooperatives were spontaneously organized under unstable prices, many citizens joined the cooperatives in order to buy cheap food, resulting in cross-membership and over-reporting of the population. Most of the cadres of the cooperatives were also temporarily assigned and had not been democratically elected. Many bad elements infiltrated the leadership, so since the beginning of this year, there have been continuous incidents of corruption, waste, loss of funds, theft, credit sales, loans, and absconding with funds. From July last year to April this year, 74 cooperative units experienced accidents, with losses of over 18.24 million yuan and over 680,000 jin of grain. The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative began its investigation on March 1st. As of March 20th, it had cleared 325,807 falsely reported and cross-registered members (including members of 17 canceled cooperatives). There are currently 505 consumer cooperatives with 832,240 members, accounting for over 40 percent of the city's population. In order to reverse the sluggish business situation, the Municipal General Cooperative held an enlarged cadre meeting of the Citizens' Consumer Cooperatives on June 8th, deciding to implement quotas from June (each cooperative's cadre averaging daily sales of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan), fixed rates (gross profit not exceeding 10 percent, management fees not exceeding 3 percent, loss rate, taking corn flour as an example, not exceeding 0.07 percent), establishing a new work style (honesty, democracy, unity, hard work, and simplicity), strengthening the unity among cooperative cadres, and establishing work systems (personnel appointment and removal, management fee expenditure, accounting responsibilities, and reporting systems). It also called on all cooperatives to launch a three-comparison movement in June: comparing business, comparing systems, and comparing work style, exerting maximum effort to improve operations and strive for a shift from sluggish to developing business. After the meeting, cadres of various cooperatives generally adopted operating methods such as extending sales hours, not resting at noon, business as usual on Sundays, door-to-door promotion with samples, setting up distribution points, mobile sales vehicles, and delivering goods to members, which were warmly welcomed by cooperative members. At the same time, since the city's cooperatives implemented joint procurement in May, private factories and cooperatives have become closer, and the prices of consignment goods have also been readjusted. For example, the Tianjin Soap Company's soap discount was changed from 95% to 92%, and the Hongye Soy Sauce Factory's soy sauce discount was changed from 90% to 80%, creating favorable conditions for business development. Therefore, the turnover of each cooperative generally increased in June. For example, the General Cooperative's store increased from an average daily sales of 44 million yuan to 100 million yuan; District 1 increased from 194,000 yuan per person per day in the early ten days to 340,000 yuan, an increase of 76.1% compared with May; the sales of the remaining five districts increased by 65.7% compared with May; District 4 increased by 102.6%; District 6 increased by 120.1% (the above are based on the average of sales for June 9th, 10th, and 11th). However, the development of business in various districts is still uneven, and the General Cooperative's business coordination is not enough. In order to correct the above shortcomings, the General Cooperative held another enlarged cadre meeting of the city's employee cooperatives on June 20th to deploy the work of reorganizing the organization and improving operations.

　　整顿组织改变经营方式
    天津合作社业务开始活跃
    【本报讯】天津市消费合作社，半年来积极整顿组织，清查贪污浪费，并适应物价稳定后的新情况，改变机关化经营方式，实行联合采购，开展代购代销，因而在进入六月后，业务转向活跃，已走上正常发展的道路。天津消费合作社在一九四九年年底统计，已有四百六十二个单位（塘大区在外），社员一、○九二、四七九人，占全市人口二分之一以上，但因为大部合作社是在物价不稳的情况下自发组织起来的，好多市民为了入社后可买到便宜食粮，所以发生跨社和多报人口的现象。各合作社的干部也多由临时指派，未经民主选举，有很多坏分子混入领导机构，所以今年以来连续发生贪污、浪费、丢款、被盗、赊货、借款、卷款潜逃等事件，从去年七月到今年四月，发生事故的单位社有七十四个，损失款项一千八百二十四万余元，粮食六十八万余斤。市供销总社从三月一日开始进行清查工作，截至三月二十日，共清除了虚报和跨社社员三十二万五千八百○七人（其中包括注销的十七社社员），现实有消费社五○五个，社员八三二、二四○人，占全市人口百分之四十以上。市总社为了扭转营业不振情况，于六月八日又召开市民消费社扩大干部会议，决定自六月份起实行定额（每个社的干部平均每日销货三十万元到四十万元），定率（毛利不超过百分之十，管理费不超过百分之三，伤耗率、以玉米面为例，不超过百分之○·○七），树立新作风（廉洁、民主、团结、艰苦、朴素），加强社的干部之间的团结，建立工作制度（人事任免、管理费开支、会计职责、表报制度），并号召各社在六月份中展开三比运动：比业务、比制度、比作风，发挥最大努力改善经营，争取业务由萧条转向发展。各社干部会后普遍采用了延长卖货时间，中午不休息，星期日照常营业，带着货样挨户宣传，设分销处，流动售货车，并给社员送货等经营方式，受到社员群众热烈欢迎。同时，自五月份全市合作社实行联合采购以来，私营工厂和合作社更加靠拢、代销品的价格也重新调整。如天津造胰公司的肥皂，由九五扣改为九二扣，宏业酱油厂的酱油由九扣改为八扣，更造成业务开展的有利条件。所以六月份各社营业额普遍增加。如总社门市部由平均每日销货额四千四百万元增至一亿元；一区由旬初每人每日销货额十九万四千元增至三十四万元，较五月份增加了百分之七六·一，其余五区销货额较五月份增百分之六五·七；四区增百分之一○二·六；六区增百分之一二○·一（以上均以六月九、十、十一三天销货额平均比较）。但各区业务的开展尚不平衡，总社的业务配合也还不够，为了纠正以上缺点，六月二十日总社又召开全市职工社扩大干部会议，布置整顿组织，改善经营工作。
