　　How Nansha Ridge Village Organizes the Masses to Read the Newspaper
    Introduction to the Experience of Rural Newspaper Reading Groups
    The Nansha Ridge Newspaper Reading Group in the Third District of Yanggao County, Chahar Province, was established in March of this year. The village originally subscribed to a newspaper, but few people read it. Later, there was Yan Jinwen in the village who was relatively well-educated. He sometimes took the newspaper to read on the street. One day, when the villagers saw him reading the newspaper, some of them asked him to read it aloud to everyone. Everyone was very interested. From then on, many people often gathered together automatically to listen to Yan read the newspaper during the noon break. At that time, the village's CCP branch saw the masses' demand for listening to the newspaper, and immediately convened a village branch committee meeting to discuss and decide on the issue of organizing a newspaper reading group, and carried out ideological mobilization at the Party and League member meetings, first calling on Party members to actively participate in the newspaper reading group in order to drive the masses to participate in listening to the newspaper.

    After the newspaper reading group was formally established, it carried out newspaper reading and listening under the leadership of the village propaganda and education committee. The whole group has five people, all of whom have clear divisions of labor: three people are specifically responsible for reading the newspaper on the street; two people combine political classes in the people's school to talk to the masses about the newspaper. In terms of newspaper reading locations, in order to facilitate the concentration of the masses, they chose three moderate locations, and used the rest time after the masses had lunch to divide the masses into three groups to read the newspaper, with no less than thirty or forty people every day. Moreover, the vast majority are Party members, League members, village cadres, village representatives, etc. After listening, they are responsible for publicizing to the masses. In terms of newspaper reading content: they can generally choose according to the needs of the masses, such as current affairs, various policies and common sense of agricultural production, good and bad examples of village cadres, and market information. Because this kind of news suits the needs of the masses, they love to listen to it.

    Because the newspaper reading was organized, the newspaper established a close relationship with the masses in the village, and the Party's policies were publicized among the masses through newspaper reading. The masses understood the policies, thus eliminating production concerns and daring to produce with confidence. For example, middle peasants Xu Dengchao and Xu Ruike bought 14 mu of land this year after receiving their land certificates. At the same time, because the village cadres of Nansha Ridge Village have paid attention to newspaper study, their political awareness has also improved compared to before. They also established a correspondence group on the basis of the newspaper reading group to organize the masses to write to the newspaper.

    From the Nansha Ridge newspaper reading group, the following points of experience can be drawn: (1) The exemplary role of Party branch members is an important key to driving newspaper reading work. (2) To do a good job in newspaper reading, there must be leadership. (3) The newspaper reading group, the blackboard newspaper, and the correspondence group should be well integrated. Only when the three are closely combined can they be more consolidated. (4) To consolidate the enthusiasm of the audience, it is necessary to improve the newspaper reading methods and choose content that meets the needs of the masses, so as to attract more masses to participate in listening to the newspaper, and the enthusiasm of the audience will always remain good.

　　南沙岭村是怎样组织群众读报的
    农村读报组经验介绍
    察哈尔省阳高县三区南沙岭读报小组是在今年三月间建立起来的，该村原来就订着一份报纸。但是很少有人去看它。后来村里有个文化较高的阎进文，他有时就拿着报纸在街头上看。有一天村里的人见他看报，有的人就要求他读给大家听。大家很感兴趣。从此以后，就经常有许多人自动的集合在一起，在上午歇晌时间听阎给他们读报。当时村里中共支部看到群众这种听报的要求，马上便召开了村支委会，讨论并决定了组织读报小组的问题，并在党、团员会上做了思想动员，首先号召党员要积极参加读报小组，以带动群众参加听报。
    读报小组正式成立以后，即在村宣教委员会领导下进行读报和听报。全组共五个人，都做了明确分工：三人专门负责街头读报；二人结合上政治课在民校里给群众讲报。在读报地点上，他们为了便于集中群众起见，选择了三个适中的地点，利用群众吃了午饭后这个休息时间，分了三片给大家读报，每天都不下三四十个人。而且绝大部分是党、团员、村干部、村代表等，他们听完以后再负责向群众宣传。在读报内容上：一般还能按照群众要求去选择，如时事、农业生产各种政策、常识、村干部好坏事例及行情等类消息。因为这类新闻适合群众需要，所以他们很爱听。
    因为组织了读报，所以报纸和村里群众建立了密切关系，通过读报在群众中宣传了党的政策。群众明白了政策，因而消除了生产顾虑，敢于放心生产了。如中农许登朝、许瑞科二人在土地证领发后，今年还买下十四亩地。同时南沙岭村干部因为注意了报纸学习，现在他们政治觉悟亦较前提高了。他们又在读报组基础上建立起一个通讯小组，组织群众给报纸写稿。
    从南沙岭读报组，可得出以下几点经验：（一）支部党员模范作用，是带动读报工作的重要关键。（二）搞好读报工作，一定要有领导。（三）读报组、黑板报和通讯组应很好的结合，只有三者密切结合，才能更加巩固。（四）要想巩固听众情绪，必须改良读报方法，选择适合群众需要的内容，这样才能吸引更多群众参加听报，而且听众情绪也会永久保持良好。
