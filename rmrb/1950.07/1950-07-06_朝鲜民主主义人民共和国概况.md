　　Overview of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
　　The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has a total land area of over 85,000 square miles and a total population of 30 million. The north of the Republic borders China's northeastern provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, its northeast corner borders the Soviet Far East, and its south faces Japan across the sea. The south of the Republic is mainly an agricultural area, while the north has relatively developed industry. Sixty percent of all industry and eighty-five percent of heavy industry are concentrated in the north.
　　Japanese imperialism waged two wars of plunder to seize Korea – the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. After these two wars, Japanese imperialism, with the tacit consent of American and British imperialism, turned Korea into its protectorate and formally annexed Korea as its colony in 1910. The Japanese bandits subjected the Korean people to direct and brutal colonial enslavement for a total of 36 years.
　　The Korean nation is a nation that loves freedom and has a glorious history of struggle for national liberation. Under the influence of the great Russian October Revolution, the Korean people launched a nationwide anti-Japanese national liberation struggle on March 1, 1919. In 1924, the Korean Federation of Trade Unions was established, and in 1925, the Korean Communist Party was founded, becoming the inspirer and organizer of the national liberation struggle. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese bandits launched a war of aggression against China. After this, the Korean people began to carry out armed struggles, conducting guerrilla warfare in North Korea, and actively participating in the armed resistance against Japan in Northeast and North China, writing a glorious page in the history of the common struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against the Japanese aggressors.
　　On August 15, 1945, the great Soviet army finally defeated the Japanese imperialists, bringing the 30 million Korean people the opportunity for national independence, democracy, and prosperity. However, American imperialists used the "38th parallel," which was divided during the war, to split Korea and, through its tool of aggression, the "United Nations Commission on Korea," staged a separate sham election in South Korea on May 10, 1948, creating a puppet state called "Republic of Korea" and the Syngman Rhee puppet government, turning South Korea into an American military base and colony. The people of South Korea launched a widespread struggle to resist this sham election. Even under the threat of bayonets, the number of people in South Korea forced to participate in the election was still less than 30 percent of the total number of voters.
　　The entire Korean people are resolutely fighting for the unification, independence, and freedom of the country. In June 1948, representatives of various democratic parties and social organizations in North and South Korea held a congress and held a universal democratic election throughout the country in August. Although the Syngman Rhee group adopted bloody terrorist measures to obstruct the democratic election in South Korea, arresting a total of 9,081 people and massacring 291 people, 6,712,401 people in South Korea, disregarding the danger to their lives, participated in the secret election, accounting for 77.52 percent of the total number of voters in South Korea. In the democratic and free North Korea, the participation in the election accounted for 99.98 percent of the total number of voters. As a result of the election, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the nation of the entire Korean people, was established, and the central government of the entire Korean people, headed by Kim Il-sung, the national hero of the Korean people, was formed.
　　Since the southern half of the Republic was illegally occupied by the American imperialists and their running dog, the Syngman Rhee puppet government, the Central Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the strong assistance of the Soviet army and the Soviet people, first carried out a series of social reforms in the northern half of Korea and began a rapid economic and cultural construction.
　　North Korea completed the land reform in 1946, confiscating the land of the Japanese, Korean traitors, and landlords, and distributing it to the peasants without compensation, enabling 70 percent of the peasants without land or with little land to obtain land. At the same time, it also confiscated the enterprises, mines, railways, and banks controlled by the Japanese "Oriental Development Company" and Korean traitors and nationalized them.
　　On the basis of land reform and the nationalization of large enterprises, North Korea's productivity has rapidly increased, successively completing two one-year economic plans, and will soon complete the two-year economic plan ahead of schedule and begin to implement a new three-year plan. The greatest achievement in economic construction is the elimination of the colonial nature of Korean industry caused by the Japanese occupation period, and the restoration and surpassing of the pre-liberation production level on the basis of establishing an independent and autonomous industry. For example, the total industrial output in 1948 increased by 311 percent compared with the initial period of 1946. After the completion of the two-year plan, the total output of state-owned industries will be doubled compared to 1948.
　　The level of agricultural production has also increased astonishingly. Although 1949 was a rare drought year, grain output increased by more than 624,000 tons compared with 1944 before liberation, which not only solved the problem of food shortage but also had surplus grain. The increase in various livestock also increased by 18 to 54 percent compared with 1948. According to the two-year plan, this year's grain output will increase by another 15.9 percent, and various livestock will increase by another 16.8 to 26.5 percent.
　　As a result of the development of production, people's lives have been greatly improved. Workers' wages have increased by an average of 15.1 percent. Farmers' incomes have also increased greatly. In 1948 alone, more than 101,000 new houses were built in rural areas.
　　There have also been rapid achievements in cultural education. During the period of Japanese rule, there were 2.3 million illiterate people and no universities. As a result of the Republic government's vigorous efforts to eliminate illiteracy, illiteracy has been basically eliminated. Now 11 universities have been established in the whole region. The number of primary school students has doubled compared with 1944, the number of middle school students has increased tenfold, and the number of clubs and libraries has increased 48 times.
　　On June 25, 1950, the Syngman Rhee puppet group in South Korea, under the direction of American imperialism, suddenly launched a full-scale invasion of the northern half of the Republic. The entire Korean people, in order to "defend the various free rights and happy lives already acquired in the northern half of the Republic and to promote all these democratic reforms to the southern half" (in the words of Kim Tu-bong), have launched a war of liberation against the Syngman Rhee puppet, the culprit of the civil war. No matter how hard American imperialism and its running dogs struggle, the final victory will surely belong to the Korean people.

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国概况
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全国领土面积八万五千余方英里，总人口三千万。共和国的北部和我国东北的辽东、吉林两省接壤，东北角与苏联远东边疆接壤，南部与日本隔海相望。共和国的南部则主要是农业区，北部工业相当发达。全部工业的百分之六十，重工业的百分之八十五，都集中在北部。
    日本帝国主义为侵占朝鲜，曾进行过两次掠夺战争——一八九五年的中日甲午战争和一九○五年的日俄战争。在这两次战争后，日本帝国主义在美英帝国主义的默许下，把朝鲜变为它的保护国，并于一九一○年，正式吞并朝鲜为它的殖民地。日寇对朝鲜人民进行直接的残酷的殖民地奴役，共达三十六年之久。
    朝鲜民族是酷爱自由的民族，它有着争取民族解放的光荣斗争史。在俄国伟大十月革命的影响下，朝鲜人民在一九一九年三月一日曾发动了全国性的反日民族解放斗争。一九二四年成立了朝鲜劳动总同盟，一九二五年又创立了朝鲜共产党，成为民族解放斗争的鼓舞者与组织者。一九三七年七月七日，日寇发动了对中国的侵略战争。在此以后，朝鲜人民就开始进行武装斗争，在北朝鲜进行游击战，并积极参加了我国东北和华北的武装抗战，在中朝两国人民共同抗击日本侵略者的斗争史上，写下了光辉的一页。
    一九四五年八月十五日，伟大的苏军最后击败了日本帝国主义者，给朝鲜三千万人民带来了祖国独立、民主、富强的机会。但美帝国主义者却利用战时划分的“三八”线，实行分裂朝鲜，并利用其侵略工具“联合国朝鲜委员会”，于一九四八年五月十日在南朝鲜导演了单独伪选，制造了一个傀儡国家“大韩民国”和李承晚傀儡政府，将南朝鲜变为美国的军事基地与殖民地。南朝鲜人民曾发动了广泛的斗争，抵制这次伪选。虽在刺刀威胁下，南朝鲜被迫参加选举的人数，仍不及选民总数的百分之三十。
    全朝鲜人民坚决为国家的统一、独立与自由而奋斗。一九四八年六月，南北朝鲜的各民主政党与社会团体，曾召开代表大会，并于八月在全国举行普遍的民主选举。李承晚集团虽然采取血腥恐怖手段，阻挠在南朝鲜进行民主选举，一共逮捕了九千零八十一人，屠杀了二百九十一人，但是，南朝鲜人民不顾生命危险参加秘密选举的，仍达六百七十一万二千四百零一人，占南朝鲜选民总数百分之七十七点五二。在民主自由的北朝鲜，参加选举的则占选民总数的百分之九十九点九八。选举的结果，成立了全朝鲜人民自己的国家——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并组成了全朝鲜人民自己的中央政府——以朝鲜人民民族英雄金日成为首的朝鲜中央政府。
    由于共和国的南半部被美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚傀儡政府所非法盘据，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国中央政府在苏军和苏联人民的大力援助下，首先在朝鲜的北半部进行了一系列的社会改革，开始了突飞猛进的经济与文化建设。
    北朝鲜在一九四六年就完成了土地改革，没收日本人、鲜奸和地主的土地，无代价地分配给农民，使百分之七十无地与少地的农民都获得了土地。同时，并没收日本“东方拓殖会社”与鲜奸所控制的企业、矿山、铁路和银行，收归国有。
    在土地改革和大企业国有的基础上，北朝鲜的生产力飞速地提高，接连胜利地完成了两个一年经济计划，今年即将提前完成二年经济计划，并将开始实行新的三年计划。经济建设最伟大的成绩，是消除了日寇统治时期对朝鲜工业所造成的殖民地性，并在建立独立自主的工业的基础上恢复并超过解放前的生产水平。比如，一九四八年的工业总产量即比一九四六年初期提高了百分之三百一十一。在二年计划完成后，国营工业的总产量，又将提高到一九四八年的二倍。
    农业生产水平也有同样惊人的提高。一九四九年虽是少有的旱年，但粮食产量却比解放前一九四四年增加六十二万四千多吨，不但解决了粮食不足的问题，并且有了余粮。各种家畜的增殖也比一九四八年增加了百分之十八到五十四。按照二年计划，今年的粮食产量将再增加百分之十五点九，各种家畜将再增加百分之十六点八到二十六点五。
    由于生产发展的结果，人民的生活已大大提高。工人工资平均增加了百分之十五点一。农民的收入也大大增加，仅一九四八年一年中，农村中就新建筑了十万一千余所新房屋。
    文化教育方面也有突飞猛进的成就。日寇统治时代，共有二百三十万文盲，没有一所大学。经共和国政府大力扫除文盲的结果，文盲已基本肃清。现在全区已建立了十一所大学。初等学校的学生比一九四四年增加了二倍，中学生增加十倍，俱乐部与图书馆增加了四十八倍。
    一九五○年六月二十五日，南朝鲜李承晚傀儡集团在美帝国主义指使下，向共和国北半部突然发动了全面进犯。全朝鲜人民为了“保卫共和国北半部已取得的各种自由权利与幸福生活，并把这一切民主改革推行到南半部去”（金枓奉语），已展开了反对内战祸首李承晚傀儡的解放战争。不论美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚如何挣扎，最后胜利必属于朝鲜人民。
