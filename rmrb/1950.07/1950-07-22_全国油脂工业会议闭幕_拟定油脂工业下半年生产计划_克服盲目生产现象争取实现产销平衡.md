Xinhua News Agency, July 20th:

　　The National Oil Industry Conference convened by the Ministry of Food Industry of the Central People's Government has formulated the national oil industry's production plan for the second half of this year. The conference was held from June 27th to July 11th, with the participation of more than 80 representatives from industrial departments and public and private oil factories in various regions. After thoroughly studying the difficulties currently encountered by the oil industry, the conference formulated a production plan for the second half of this year based on the actual situation of the current domestic and foreign markets. The main difficulties encountered by the oil industry are: due to the destruction of long-term war and disasters in some areas, people's purchasing power has been greatly reduced, and because sea transportation to Haikou is not smooth, a large amount of oil cake cannot be exported, so the sales of edible oil and oil cake are extremely difficult. The blind production of local oil presses has further aggravated the phenomenon of overproduction. Most oil factories have been forced to stop work or semi-stop work due to sluggish sales of finished products and the failure of capital turnover. From January to May of this year, the average monthly oil production of private oil factories in Shanghai was 9,000 dan, which is more than half less than the average monthly output last year. The East China Machinery Oil Factory can produce more than 2 million dan of oil annually, but sales are only 1 million dan. In Hebei Province, only 11 percent of the manual oil presses can maintain production, and only 80 percent of the machine oil factories can continue production. It can be seen that under the current situation of very low purchasing power of the people, the oil production capacity in various regions has exceeded the needs.

    In order to avoid blind production and gradually achieve a balance between production and sales, the conference decided that the nation will produce a total of 64,000 tons of various oils and 233,650 tons of various oil cakes in the second half of this year. Among them, the East China region will produce 40,190 tons of oil and 152,000 tons of oil cake; the North China region will produce 18,980 tons of oil and 55,170 tons of oil cake; the Central South region will produce 3,800 tons of oil and 16,850 tons of oil cake; the Southwest region will produce 900 tons of oil and 1,800 tons of oil cake; and the Northwest region will produce 130 tons of oil and 530 tons of oil cake.

    In order to help oil industrialists overcome some of the difficulties in raw materials and sales, the state-owned China Oil Company will be responsible for supplying part of the raw materials and purchasing part of the finished products, and will entrust private oil industries to carry out processing. The number will be appropriately allocated according to the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, and the current production capacity. In addition, local grain bureaus, native produce companies, and grain companies should also entrust private oil industries to carry out processing as much as possible. The processing profit is tentatively set at 2 percent, but when oil and cake are sluggish in sales, the principle is to maintain production (i.e., break even). The standard of the produced finished products shall be based on the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, in order to facilitate export.

    The conference decided to establish a General Bureau of Oil Industry under the Ministry of Food Industry of the Central People's Government to coordinate the production of the national oil industry. A Food Industry Administration Bureau shall be established in the industrial departments of major administrative regions, with an oil management unit in the bureau; the industrial departments of each province shall establish an oil management unit according to the needs of the province and city, to lead the production of the national state-owned and public-private oil industry.

　　全国油脂工业会议闭幕
    拟定油脂工业下半年生产计划
    克服盲目生产现象争取实现产销平衡
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府食品工业部所召开的全国油脂工业会议已拟定全国油脂工业今年下半年的生产计划。这个会议系于六月二十七日至七月十一日举行，出席各地区工业部门及公、私营油厂代表八十余人。会议详尽地研究了目前油脂工业所遇到的困难以后，根据目前国内外市场的实际情况，拟定了今年下半年度的生产计划。油脂工业所遇到的困难，主要是：由于长期战争及部分地区灾荒的破坏，人民购买力已大为降低，加以由于海口运输尚未畅通，大量油饼无法外销，故食用油及油饼的销路极感困难。而各地土榨油坊盲目生产，更加重了生产过剩的现象。大部分油厂已因成品滞销，资金周转失灵，陷于停工或半停工状态。今年一月至五月，上海私营油厂平均月产油九千市担，较去年每月平均产量减少了一半以上。华东机械油厂，每年共可产油二百余万担，而销售量却只有一百万担。河北省的手工油坊只有百分之十一能维持生产，机器油厂也只有百分之八十能继续生产。由此可见，在目前人民购买力很低的情况下面，各地油脂生产能力已超过需要。
    为了避免生产中的盲目现象，逐步做到产销平衡，会议决定今年下半年度全国共生产各种油六万四千吨及各种油饼二十三万三千六百五十吨。其中华东区产油四万零一百九十吨，产饼十五万二千吨；华北区产油一万八千九百八十吨，产饼五万五千一百七十吨；中南区产油三千八百吨，产饼一万六千八百五十吨；西南区产油九百吨，产饼一千八百吨；西北区产油一百三十吨，产饼五百三十吨。
    为了帮助油脂工业者克服一部分原料和销路的困难，国营中国油脂公司将负责供应一部分原料及收购一部分成品，并委托私营油脂业进行加工。其数目将按公私兼顾的原则，以及目前开工的生产能力，作适当分配。此外，各地粮食局，土产公司及粮食公司等在可能范围内也应委托私营油脂业进行加工。加工利润暂定为百分之二，但在油、饼滞销时，则以维持生产（即保本）为原则。所产成品标准，以上海商品检验局为准则，以利出口。
    会议决定在中央人民政府食品工业部下成立油脂工业总局，统筹全国油脂工业的生产。在各大行政区工业部门成立食品工业管理局，局内设油脂管理单位；各省工业部门，根据省市的需要，设立油脂管理单位，以领导全国国营及公、私营油脂工业的生产。
