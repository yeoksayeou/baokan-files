Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 15th: A dispatch from TASS's Moscow bureau reports that Pravda correspondent Zhukov pointed out that the composition of Pleven's cabinet, who was once a close collaborator of De Gaulle, is almost indistinguishable from the previous Bidault and Queuille cabinets. However, the new development this time is that Pleven obtained the approval of all factions of the "American Party," with only the Communists and progressive members who support the Communists voting against it.

As early as 1948, Pleven advocated an alliance between De Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" and the parties of the so-called "Third Force." This time, he completed the formation of the cabinet, realizing his plan. Initially, right-wing socialists refused Pleven's proposal to convince people that they were opponents of De Gaulle. However, now Mollet himself has accepted the position in the government second only to Pleven. As is often the case when the bourgeoisie encounters difficulties, the right-wing socialists, who have been acting as the "moderate opposition" for six months, have once again been brought to the forefront. After the Queuille cabinet died prematurely, Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet, under the order of President Auriol, prepared a "common program," paving the way for Pleven and preparing for the return of right-wing socialists to the government.

The legitimate demands of the working people, which Bidault rejected, are not reflected in Mollet's program or in Pleven's declaration drafted based on this program. On the contrary, Pleven's parliamentary speech clearly shows that the new government will more enthusiastically follow the political line dictated by foreign countries. Washington requires all Marshall Plan countries to embark on the path of accelerated war preparations, and Pleven's political program and cabinet composition meet Washington's requirements.

Pleven's cabinet will encounter a lot of difficulties from the beginning. His program cannot but be opposed by the broad masses who hate war. At present, a new upsurge of protests against the "program of accelerated military preparations and fascism" is rising across the country. The French people held their annual July 14th grand demonstration, with the slogan: Fight for peace, freedom, and national independence, oppose the preparation of a new war, oppose repression, and oppose turning France into a supplier of cannon fodder for American military adventures.

### 朱可夫评法普利文新阁  指出它势将遭受憎恨战争的广大群众的反对

　　朱可夫评法普利文新阁
    指出它势将遭受憎恨战争的广大群众的反对
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫指出，曾是戴高乐的密切合作者的普利文的内阁，其组成成份与先前的皮杜尔、葛义内阁几乎毫无分别。但是，这一次的新发展是：普利文取得了所有“美国党”各派系的赞成票，只有共产党人和支持共产党人的进步议员投票反对。
    普利文早在一九四八年，就主张戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”和所谓“第三种力量”的党派结成联盟。这一次他完成组阁，得以实现他的计划。当初，右翼社会党人为了要使人们相信他们是戴高乐的对头，曾拒绝普利文的建议。然而，现在摩勒亲自接受了政府内仅次于普利文的位置。正如资产阶级遭遇困难时所常有的那样，六个月来一直充当“温和反对派”的右翼社会党人，再度被请出前台。在葛义内阁夭折以后，社会党总书记摩勒受总统阿里奥尔之命，准备了“共同纲领”，为普利文铺平道路，同时，并准备了右翼社会党人的重返政府。
    皮杜尔所拒绝的劳动人民的合法要求，无论在摩勒的纲领里，或是在根据这一纲领而起草的普利文的宣言里，都看不到一点反映。相反地，普利文的议会演说却明白显示：新政府将更热心地遵循外国所指示的政治路线。华盛顿要求一切马歇尔化国家走上从速准备战争的道路，而普利文的政治纲领和内阁成份都是合乎华盛顿的要求的。
    普利文内阁将会从开始就碰到大量的困难。他的纲领不能不遭到憎恨战争的广大群众的反对。目前，全国正兴起新的抗议“加速军事准备和法西斯化的纲领”的怒潮。法国人民举行了一年一度的七月十四日大示威，他们的口号是：进行斗争，争取和平、自由和民族独立，反对准备新战争，反对镇压，反对把法国变成美国军事冒险的炮灰供给者。
