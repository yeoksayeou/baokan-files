　　Leading Cadres Play a Model Role in Learning
    Significant Achievements in Cadre Study in the Liaodong Military Region
    [This Dispatch from Andong] Over the past six months, more than 3,000 cadres at the platoon level and above in the Liaodong Military Region have persisted in both their military work and their studies, achieving remarkable results. Among these cadres, apart from a portion with higher levels of education and theoretical understanding who independently completed Political Economy (Group A), A Brief History of Social Development (Group B), or The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party (Group C), the remaining 2,000 cadres participated in literacy studies. Each division established supplementary cultural schools within their headquarters, divided into various classes below the second year of junior high school. Over the past six months, the majority of students have improved their educational level equivalent to one year of study in ordinary schools. For example, in the cultural supplementary school directly under the Military Region, all students in the higher primary class, except for one who was held back, were promoted to the first year of junior high school; three-quarters of those in the lower primary third and fourth grades were promoted to the higher primary class. Currently, among the cadres at all levels in a certain division, those who can recognize more than 400 characters account for 69 percent of the total. Some individuals who have worked particularly hard in their studies have gone from being illiterate to being able to make simple records and write notes.
    The reasons for achieving the above results are mainly the leading cadres' exemplary role in learning and the full promotion of a democratic style in teaching. Ouyang Jiaxiang, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, and several department directors took the lead in participating in literacy studies, exemplarily observing classroom rules, and respecting teachers. They first adhered to the regulation of being assigned to classes according to their educational level, enrolling in appropriate classes for study; in class, they raised their hands before asking questions, stood up when answering teachers' questions, and followed the teachers' instructions to go to the blackboard to attempt exercises. Usually, they humbly sought individual help from teachers. In addition, they were able to promptly criticize and educate individual cadres who did not observe classroom discipline, so that everyone could put aside their airs and learn humbly. Many cadres not only helped each other in their studies but also learned from guards and others with higher levels of education.
    In terms of teaching, the cultural supplementary schools in the Liaodong Military Region adopted three democratic "teacher evaluation" methods based on the characteristics of military education. One method was to regularly convene meetings of student representatives from each class to widely solicit students' feedback and provide opinions on teaching methods based on the characteristics of the students. This approach greatly helped the teachers. The second method was to convene meetings of cadres with strong teaching abilities, where teachers gave typical reports on their teaching methods, and then everyone engaged in discussions, pointing out their shortcomings and proposing suggestions for improvement. These meetings not only enriched the lesson plans prepared by some teachers but also educated other teachers who attended. Another approach was to extensively absorb the teaching experiences of local ordinary schools. For example, teachers and cadres were organized to visit and attend classes in middle schools, and after returning, they held discussions based on their teaching methods, drawing on experiences suitable for the military situation to enrich themselves.
    In addition, the cadres participating in the study in each unit were divided into study groups. Some were led by the responsible cadres of the unit, who usually inspected and led everyone's study; when cadres went out to work, the group leader would assign a certain study task in advance and designate comrades working with him to provide assistance and organize them. When cadres returned from working outside, they had to report not only on their work but also on their study situation while away.
    Because the general cadres have a high demand for learning, coupled with these appropriate measures, the learning enthusiasm of the entire army's cadres has always been very high, enabling cultural learning to unfold enthusiastically.

　　领导干部在学习中起模范作用
    辽东军区干部学习成绩显著
    【本报安东讯】辽东军区三千余名排以上干部，半年多来一面坚持部队工作，一面坚持学习，获得了显著的成绩。这些干部中，除一部分文化、理论水平较高的干部分头学完了政治经济学（甲组）、社会发展简史（乙组）或中国革命与中国共产党（丙组）外，其余两千名干部都参加了文化学习。各师分别设立了机关文化补习学校，分编了初中二年级以下各种班次。半年来大多数学员提高了普通学校里学习一年的文化程度。如军区直属机关文化补习学校，高小班学员除一人留级外，都升入了初中一年级；初小三、四年级有四分之三升入了高小班。目前，某师各级干部中能识四百字以上的人员已占总人数的百分之六十九。个别学习特别努力的，已从文盲达到能作简单的记录、写便条了。
    获得上述成绩的原因，主要是领导干部的带头学习和教学中充分发扬了民主作风。军区副司令员欧阳稼祥和几位部主任，他们带头参加文化学习，模范地遵守课堂规则，尊重教员。他们首先遵守了按文化程度编班的规定，分别编入适宜的班次学习；在课堂上，提问题时先举手，回答教员问题时起立，并服从教员的指导到黑板上去试作习题。平时，他们虚心地请教员作个别帮助。此外，对个别不遵守课堂纪律的干部，他们能及时给以批评教育，使大家都能放下架子，虚心学习。许多干部除互相帮助学习外，并向文化程度较高的警卫员等学习。
    在教学上，辽东军区各文化补习学校根据部队教育的特点，采用了三种民主化的“评教”方法。一种是定期召集各班学员代表开会，广泛征求学员的反映，根据学员的特点，提供教学方法上的意见，这种方式对教员帮助很大。第二种是召集教学能力较强的干部开会，由教员在会上作典型报告，解释自己的教学方法，然后大家展开讨论，指出其缺点，提出改进意见。这种会议不独充实了一部分教员准备教课的教案，也教育了到会的其他教员。另一种方式是广泛地吸收当地普通学校中的教学经验。如组织教员、干部到中学参观、听课，回来后根据他们的教学方法举行座谈，吸取其适合军队情况的经验以丰富自己。
    此外，各单位参加学习的干部都分编了学习小组。有的由单位的负责干部担任组长，平时检查、领导大家的学习；在干部外出工作时，事先由组长布置一定的学习任务，并指定与他在一块工作的同志进行帮助，并将他们组织起来。干部外出回来，不仅要汇报工作，还要汇报在外的学习情况。
    由于一般干部都有高度的学习要求，再有这些适当的措施，全军干部的学习情绪始终都很高，使文化学习得以热烈展开。
