    Some say, "To see if a composer is great, just look at how much folk music is quoted in his works."

    Indeed, music masters throughout history have been nurtured by folk music. German folk songs influenced Beethoven, and Russian folk songs influenced Tchaikovsky, both to a great extent. Although, compared to other musicians, these two composers were relatively less influenced by folk music.

    In China, Xian Xinghai was the same. The rhythm of Cantonese percussion music gave inspiration to "Yellow River". In terms of utilizing folk music language, this has the same significance as Tchaikovsky's "Andante cantabile" being based on Russian folk tunes. Xian Xinghai learned the language of folk music, refined it, and elevated it. At the same time, as the wealth of the people, it in turn enriched the language of national music.

    Nie Er was also like this. His "The Road Song" broke away from the so-called "Chinese music is pentatonic" theory held by Chinese and foreign scholars, and used Chinese modes as one of the characteristics of the Chinese musical language. The theme of this song may have come from the following Yunnan folk song:
   
    His "Striking the Yangtze River" also shows a blood relationship with Yunnan's "Crab Song":

    Of course, it cannot be said for certain that Nie Er used these two folk songs as blueprints when creating "The Road Song" and "Striking the Yangtze River". Rather, it is to say that as a native of Yuxi, Yunnan, where everyone is a singer, he was familiar with folk music from an early age. When he put pen to paper, these phrases loved by the people would surely emerge. And a composer who wants to turn his songs into the voice of the people will consciously choose phrases familiar to the people.

    But this is not the whole problem. The yellow songs of Li Jinhui's later period, in a sense, also utilized folk music vocabulary. (Of course, Li Jinhui's early children's song and dance dramas such as "Sparrow and Child" should not be confused with his later works, and had a certain role, significance, and influence.) Therefore, the important thing is not the technical use of folk music vocabulary, but the work's role and influence on the people's social life and political life. Imagine the scene back then: the suffocated political life after the failure of the Great Revolution, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Japanese military actions to destroy China... Some people traced back to the Tang and Song dynasties, clinging to elegance, "creating rites and making music"; some people chanted personal joys and sorrows, romantic stories. At most, they wanted to promote "Chinese-flavored" melodies and harmonies, and the most progressive people only "scratched an itch from afar", writing things like "farmers' four seasons of hardship and joy" from the perspective of "folk custom scholars". The market was filled with yellow, lewd, and absurd tunes. At this time, Nie Er used the Chinese musical language to write about the suffering and anger of the people. This is the real "pioneer" - cutting through thorns, chiseling stones to open mountains, paving the way, and burying the seeds...

    Nie Er's road was a road from nothing to something. China had new music because of him.

　　开拓者的聂耳
    ——纪念聂耳同志逝世十五周年
    赵沨
    有人这样说：“要看一个作曲家是否伟大，只要看他的著作中引用民歌的多少便可判定。”
    的确，古往今来的音乐大师，都曾受过民间音乐的哺养。德国民歌之于贝多芬，俄国民歌之于柴可夫斯基，都给了他们很大的影响。虽然，比起别的音乐家来，这两个作家还算是受民歌薰陶较少的呢。
    在中国，冼星海是如此。广东打敲乐的节奏曾给“黄河”以灵感。在利用民间音乐语言上说，这和柴可夫斯基的“徐缓似歌”取材于俄国民谣有相同的意义。冼星海学习了民间音乐语言，而又洗炼，提高了民间音乐语言，同时，作为人民的财富，又反过来丰富了民族音乐的语言。
    聂耳也是这样。他的“大路歌”摆脱了中外学者所谓“中国音乐是五声音阶”的说法，而用中国调式作为中国音乐语言的特点之一来着手。这支歌曲的主题可能是从下面一首云南民歌来的：
    他的“打长江”，也看得出和云南的“螃蟹歌”有着血缘关系：
    当然，不能肯定聂耳创作“大路歌”和“打长江”时，就是以这两首民谣为蓝本，而是说作为全民都是歌手的云南玉溪人，自幼就熟习民间音乐的他，在下笔时一定会涌现这些人民所喜爱的语汇。而一个想使自己的歌曲变成人民心声的作曲家，也会意识地选用人民熟悉的语汇。
    但这绝不是问题的全部。黎锦晖后期的黄色歌曲，在某种意义上说，也是利用了民间音乐语汇的。（当然，黎锦晖早期的“麻雀和小孩”等儿童歌舞剧，不应和他的后期作品混为一谈，而且具有一定的作用、意义和影响的。）所以，重要的不在于技术上利用民间乐汇，而是作品内容对人民社会生活，政治生活的作用和影响。试想一下当年的情景：大革命失败后窒息的政治生活，国民党的反动统治，日本要灭亡中国的军事行动……有些人在上溯唐宋，附庸风雅，“制礼作乐”；有的人吟咏个人的悲欢离合，风花雪月。至多也是要提倡一下“中国味”的曲调和和声，最进步的也只“隔靴抓痒”地，以“民俗学者”的趣味来写点“农家四时苦乐”一类的东西。充斥市面的是黄色的淫词谰调。正在这时候，聂耳却用中国化的音乐语言，写出人民的苦难和愤怒。这是真正的“开拓者”——披荆斩棘，凿石开山，走出了路，埋下了种……
    聂耳的路是个从无到有的路，中国有了他才有了新音乐。
