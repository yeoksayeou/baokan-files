The preliminary experiences of the Liaoxi Province's census work, under the leadership's emphasis and the in-depth supervision of the census team, have made preliminary achievements and obtained some experiences as follows, which are worthy of reference for various places.

　　1. Focusing on pilot filling is the best method for carrying out the work. Although the working cadres of the general census group have studied the census documents, their understanding is often not deep enough. Therefore, we should first concentrate our efforts on pilot filling work, participate in practical learning, and obtain experience in filling methods, technical calculations, and personnel allocation, and then go to other factories and mines to help fill out the forms.

　　2. Strengthening the connection between the province and the city (county) and combining the points and surfaces with each other is an important working method to overcome the difficulties in the work. Some counties with a small proportion of industry, small-scale factories with few personnel, lack complete original records, and lack technicians or statisticians, so they feel it is difficult to understand and fill out the forms, especially for the technical equipment item in the forms. The way to solve these problems is mainly to rely on the cooperation of points and surfaces and the mutual connection between the province and the city (county). For example, the Liaoxi Provincial Department of Industry has issued six circulars on issues related to census work, and has promptly answered temporary questions by correspondence, which has given great help to all reporting units. The Siping Central Census Group has written and introduced the calculation formulas for mechanical production equipment, transmission methods, driving capacity, and boiler heating surface to the counties and factories included in the Siping Census Area, answered filling questions, and exchanged work conditions and experience in a timely manner, helping factories solve many difficulties.

　　3. Organizing the form-filling personnel to form a census team and conduct the form-filling work in a planned and step-by-step manner is the guarantee for completing the work. For example, after the Jinzhou Census Group gained experience through pilot projects, it divided into groups to go deep into each enterprise in the city to provide specific guidance and fully launch the work, so that the first draft filling work of the city was successfully completed by the end of May. At the same time, in order to reduce or even eliminate errors in filling, the review work also needs considerable attention.

　　4. To do a good job in the census, we must have the determination and courage to overcome difficulties. There will be many difficulties in the census work, such as insufficient manpower and lack of technical personnel (except for Jinzhou and Siping, other cities in Liaoxi Province do not have surveyors), and it is not easy to estimate accurately. But if you are willing to actively think of ways, these difficulties are not difficult to overcome. For example, the Jinzhou Winery did not understand the filling method and did not understand certain items, so it went to the Jinzhou Paper Mill to learn; many factories in Jinzhou did not have technicians who could calculate the "driving capacity", so they gathered together and asked technicians from advanced factories to help explain and actually teach the calculation method, which quickly solved these difficulties. For example, the Badaohe Coal Mine could not accurately calculate the valuation, which was solved by contacting the Fuxin Mining Bureau.

### 辽西厂矿普查的初步经验

　　辽西厂矿普查的初步经验
    辽西省的普查工作，在领导重视与普查小组的深入督导之下，已做出初步成绩，并获得了下述的一些经验，值得各地参考。
    一、重点试填是开展工作最好的方法。一般普查组工作干部虽然都学习了普查文件，但往往了解还不够深刻。故应首先集中力量作重点试填工作，参加实际学习并取得填写方法、技术计算、人员配备各方面的经验后，再分别到其他厂矿帮助进行填表。
    二、加强省、市（县）联系与点面互相结合，是克服工作中的困难的重要工作方法。有些工业比重较小的县份，规模小而人员少的工厂、既缺乏完整的原始纪录，又缺乏技师或统计人员，因此对表格的理解与填写就很感困难，特别是对表格中技术设备一项发生的问题较多。解决这些问题的办法主要是依靠点面的配合与省、市（县）的互相联系。如辽西省工业厅对有关普查工作问题，曾发出六次通报，并及时通信解答临时发生的问题，对各填报单位都给了很大的帮助。四平中心普查组曾将机械生产设备、传动方式、驱动能力及锅炉加热面的计算公式，用书面介绍给四平普查区所包括的各县、各厂，并解答填报疑难问题，及时交流了工作情况与经验，帮助各厂解决了很多困难。
    三、组织填表人员成立普查小组，有计划有步骤地专门进行填报工作，是完成工作的保证。如锦州市普查小组经过试点取得经验后，又分小组深入到全市每个企业作具体的指导，全面展开工作，使全市第一步初稿填报工作于五月底即顺利结束。同时，为了减少以至消灭填写中的错误，审查工作也是需要相当重视的。
    四、要做好普查工作，必须有克服困难的决心与勇气。普查工作中会遇到不少困难，例如人力不够，技术人员缺乏（辽西全省除锦州、四平外，其他城市便没有测绘员），估计不易精确等。但是如果肯主动想办法，这些困难是不难克服的。如锦州酿造厂对填写方法不够了解，对某些项目不懂，即到锦州造纸厂去学习；锦州市很多工厂因没有技术员不会计算“驱动能力”，于是集合一起，请先进工厂技师帮助讲解，并实际教给计算方法，这样便很快解决了这些困难。又如八道壕煤矿对估价无法精确计算，因与阜新矿务局取得联系而得到解决。（辽西省工业厅指导科）
