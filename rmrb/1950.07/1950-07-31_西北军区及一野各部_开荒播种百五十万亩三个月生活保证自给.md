Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 30th: The Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have continued to increase the acreage of land reclaimed and sown, which, according to recent statistics, has reached 1.54 million mu. Various PLA units have also built more than 20 irrigation canals and reservoirs, capable of irrigating over 1.2 million mu of land. The income from the entire army's agricultural production, combined with other sideline income, can guarantee three months of self-sufficiency and improve the living conditions of the troops.

The Northwest Liberation Army contracted the construction of the Baoji-Tianshui and Tianshui-Lanzhou sections of the Longhai Railway, and has now completed nearly 3 million cubic meters of earthwork. In addition, the troops stationed in Qinghai are not only constructing the Xining-Yushu Highway, but have also begun constructing the Xining-Zhangye Highway across the Qilian Mountains. The survey work for the construction of the Xiahe Tibetan area by the troops stationed in Gansu has been completed, and preparations are now underway to build a highway from Linxia to the area. The troops stationed in Lanzhou are actively engaged in urban construction, and have contracted to repair more than 1,100 houses and build a 2,000-kilowatt power plant.
