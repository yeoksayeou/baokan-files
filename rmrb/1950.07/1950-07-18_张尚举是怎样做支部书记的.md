　　How Zhang Shangju Acts as a Party Branch Secretary
　　Special Correspondent Zhang Zhimin

　　Zhang Shangju, the famous record-breaking hero of Northeast China, has been serving as the Party Branch Secretary of the Assembly Department of the Shenyang Machine Factory No. 3 since January this year (without leaving production). In these few months of branch work, he has, on the one hand, explored some experiences in the work of factory branches, and on the other hand, created experiences in the work of a branch secretary who does not leave production. Summarized, there are the following points:

　　First, giving play to the strength of the organization, conducting timely ideological education for Party members and the masses, and improving production quantity and quality. Many factory branch secretaries are separated from production, while other branch committee members are not. As a result, some branch secretaries take on the branch work alone, which leads to the branch work not being done well. Comrade Zhang Shangju is different. He truly gives play to the strength of the organization and fulfills the branch’s task of guaranteeing and supervising production. For example, when the factory was evaluating wages, worker Tan Shufan became emotional because his salary points were reduced, and this had already affected production. After the branch discovered this, it organized education for Tan Shufan in a structured way. Branch Secretary Zhang Shangju, Trade Union Branch Chairman Tong Naitian (branch member in charge of employee affairs), Team Leader Wu Longen (Party member), and Branch Organization Committee Member Ren Binggong took turns talking to Lao Tan. They told him, "Your skills are good, but you haven't used them. Only by putting all your technical abilities into your work can you earn more money." The Youth League also drew lively cartoons on the blackboard bulletin based on the policy of more pay for more work. In this way, Lao Tan's thinking and awareness improved a step. He said, "Okay, I'll work and you'll see." Now, most workers believe that Lao Tan works much harder than before, and his work efficiency has also improved. When the factory administration called on workers to improve product quality, the bed frame team thought that Wang Shusen was not working actively and wanted to transfer him out of the team. After the branch discovered this, Branch Secretary Zhang Shangju assigned Party member Wu Longen (Team Leader) and Branch Organization Committee Member Ren Binggong (who do not directly participate in production) to educate Wang Shusen. They said to Wang Shusen, "You have to work harder. Why don't you show your skills? Let everyone see if you can do it." After repeated ideological mobilization, Wang Shusen challenged Yao Yongkai and other workers to a competition. In the competition, Wang Shusen's work efficiency was very high. Not only did his output increase, but the quality was also very high. He created a new record for quality and quantity and won a quality model banner.

　　Second, being good at using various forms to understand the situation in a timely manner and solve problems in a timely manner. Branch Secretary Zhang Shangju always asks a few questions when he meets team and group leader Party members, etc.: "How is your team? Are there any problems with the task? How is the quality?" In this way, he can understand the situation and discover problems in just three or two minutes. For example, in February, each team said that there were no problems with their tasks. However, when Comrade Zhang Shangju asked the Yao Shaoying team, Yao Shaoying said, "This time we won't be able to complete the task of improving quality." At this time, Comrade Zhang Shangju helped him calculate, but Yao Shaoying said, "I don't know how many work hours are needed, and I can't figure out how many people are needed, but anyway, we can't complete it." From this, Zhang Shangju discovered that there was a problem with the team's task. He discussed it with Wu Longen, Ren Binggong, and others, and asked them to go deep into the Yao Shaoying team to understand the situation and see what the problem was. Soon, they discovered the main ideological problem of the workers in the Yao Shaoying team, which was that they heard that the factory would no longer give bonuses for exceeding the quota (actually, this was their misunderstanding). After the explanation, everyone's concerns were eliminated. At the same time, the branch also studied that the Yao Shaoying team really needed to add a person, and suggested that the administration approve their request to add a person. As a result, the team not only improved quality but also completed the production task on time. Zhang Shangju's use of this method of understanding the situation anytime and anywhere not only solved problems in a timely manner and ensured the timely completion of production tasks but also criticized the old-fashioned working methods of some branches that believed that problems could not be discovered and solved without holding meetings. Of course, holding meetings and reporting is also one of the ways to understand the situation, but it is not the only way.

　　Third, thinking of more ways, giving more ideas, and striving for initiative in work. In April, the planning department reported that only seventeen kinds of parts had not completed the task, but in early May, the assembly shop still had a shortage of materials. After inspection by the warehouse inspection team, it was found that one hundred and nineteen kinds of parts had not completed the task. This problem fully shows that the responsibility system has not been well implemented. After the branch understood this situation, Branch Secretary Zhang Shangju first proposed to implement a tracing inspection responsibility system and publish the "Tracing Report." After the general branch studied and decided, it was submitted to the trade union for discussion and approval. In this way, anyone who is irresponsible in production can be found out. From then on, each team began to overcome the phenomenon of only focusing on completing the tasks of their own unit and lacking mutual contact, resulting in a shortage of materials. For example, in May, the assembly shop asked the manufacturing department to guarantee the supply of parts for twenty lathes within three days. After the manufacturing department agreed, in order to clarify responsibilities, the two sides signed a contract, and both were fulfilled according to the contract. Zhang Shangju said, "The quality of branch work depends on whether you take the initiative to solve problems. If you follow behind the trade union and the Youth League in everything and do not actively think of ways to work, then you will not be able to do anything."

　　Fourth, grasping the key points, gaining experience, and promoting the overall situation. In order to implement the responsibility system and improve quality, the branch focused on cultivating the bed body team as a typical example. Within the bed body team, the branch focused on cultivating team leader Li Jixun (Party member) and trade union team leader Yang Zhifeng as typical examples. As a result, a relatively complete set of responsibility system was created from this team. After the implementation of a clear division of labor and responsibility system in this team, the quality of products has increased sevenfold. The branch, in cooperation with the trade union, took various measures to publicize and promote the advanced experience of the team, calling on everyone to learn from the bed body team. When the bed body team held a review meeting, everyone was mobilized to attend and learn. Now, the experience of the bed body team has been promoted to the whole factory and has been determined as one of the administrative systems. At the same time, model teams such as the headstock, tailstock, gear box, and slide plate have emerged.

　　There are still many difficulties in Comrade Zhang Shangju's work. The main one is that he holds too many positions. In addition to serving as the branch secretary, Comrade Zhang Shangju also serves as the production committee member of the trade union, employee representative, member of the industrial management committee, member of the new record committee, and member of the wage committee, among other five positions (not including those outside the factory). Therefore, he is often busy attending meetings and cannot concentrate on the main work, which affects his study of business and his own progress in production. It is hoped that the leaders of the factory can help him solve this problem as much as possible.

　　Finally, Comrade Zhang Shangju humbly reviewed and said: "There are still many problems in my thinking: First, there is still a remnant of individual heroism, which affects the consideration of other people's opinions and may be a bit subjective. Second, it is not enough to go deep into the lower levels and approach the masses. I must overcome these shortcomings in the future."

### 张尚举是怎样做支部书记的

　　张尚举是怎样做支部书记的
    本报特约通讯员  张智民
    东北著名的创纪录英雄张尚举同志，从今年一月起担负了沈阳机器三厂装配部支部书记工作（不脱离生产）。他在这几个月的支部工作中，一方面摸索出一些工厂支部工作的经验，另一方面，创造了不脱离生产的支部书记工作经验。总结起来，有以下几点：
    第一，发挥组织力量，对党员、群众及时进行思想教育，提高了生产数量与质量。不少工厂的支部书记是脱离生产的，其他支部委员是不脱离生产的，因此有些支部书记就一人包办了支部工作。结果支部工作没作好。张尚举同志就不同，他真正发挥了组织力量，实现了支部保证与监督生产的任务。如该厂评工薪时，工友谭树范因为薪分减低而闹情绪，并已影响到生产。支部发现后，有组织地对谭树范进行了教育。支书张尚举、工会支会主任童乃田（支部职工委员）、班长吴隆恩（党员）、支部组织委员任秉公等和老谭轮流谈话，他们告诉他：“你技术好，但就是没拿出来。只有将全部技术能力拿出来干活，才能多赚钱哪。”又由青年团根据多劳多得的工资政策，在黑板报上画了生动活泼的漫画。这样老谭的思想、觉悟提高了一步。他说：“好吧，以后我干着你们看吧。”现在一般工人都认为老谭的工作比以前干得起劲得多了，工作效率也提高了。当工厂行政上号召工友提高产品质量时，床头组嫌王树森干活不积极，想把他调出组去。支部发现后，支书张尚举便分配党员吴隆恩（班长）、支部组织委员任秉公（他两人不直接参加生产）去教育王树森。他们对王树森说：“你要加把劲才行。为啥不露一手呢？让大家看看到底行不行。”经过反复的思想动员；王树森就向姚永凯等工友提出了挑战竞赛。在竞赛中，王树森的工作效率很高，不仅产量增加，而且质量也很高，创造了质量数量的新纪录，荣获质量模范奖旗一面。
    第二，善于利用各种形式，及时了解情况和及时解决问题。支书张尚举碰到班、组长党员等总要顺便问几句：“你那组怎样？任务有啥问题没有？质量怎样？”这样仅用三两分钟的时间就能了解了情况和发现问题。比如二月里各个小组的任务都说没问题了。但当张尚举同志一问姚绍英小组时，姚绍英说：“这一回提高质量我们算完不成啦。”这时张尚举同志就帮助他算账，但姚绍英说：“也不知道多少工，需多少人也没法算，反正就是完不成。”张尚举由此发现了该小组的任务有问题，便和吴隆恩、任秉公等商量，请他们深入到姚绍英小组里去了解情况，看看究竟有啥问题。不久，他们发现了姚绍英小组的工友们主要思想问题，就是听说厂子不给超额奖励了（实际上这是他们的误会）。经解释后，大家的顾虑就消除了。同时支部又研究了姚绍英小组确实需要增加一个人，便建议行政上批准他们增加一个人的要求。结果该组既提高了质量，又按期完成了生产任务。张尚举运用这种随时随地了解情况的方法不仅及时解决了问题，保证了生产任务按时完成，而且批判了某些支部认为非开会不能发现问题、解决问题的老一套的工作方法方式。自然，开会汇报也是了解情况的方式之一，但并不是唯一的方式。
    第三，多想办法，多出主意，争取工作主动。四月里，计划科汇报只有十七种部件没有完成任务，但五月上旬装配场依然发生待料现象。后经仓库检查小组检查，发现有一一九种部件没完成任务。这个问题充分说明责任制还没有很好贯彻下去。支部了解这种情况后，支书张尚举首先提出，实行追根检查责任制，并出版《追根报》。经总支研究决定后，提交工会讨论通过。这样谁在生产中不负责任就可以检查出来。各小组从此开始克服只顾本单位完成任务，而互相缺乏联系，以致造成待料的现象。如五月间，装配场向制造科提出，在三天内要求保证供给二十台车床的部件。制造科答应后，为了明确责任，双方又订立合同，结果都按合同实现了。张尚举说：“支部工作好坏，要看你是不是主动去解决问题，如果事事跟在工会和团的后面，而不主动的去想办法作工作，那就会啥也搞不出来。”
    第四，抓住重点，取得经验，推动全面。支部为贯彻责任制，提高质量，有重点地来培养床身小组为典型。在床身小组内，支部又抓紧培养小组长李继逊（党员）和工会组长杨志峰为典型。结果从这个小组创造出一套比较完整的责任制度。经这个组实行明确分工负责制后，产品的质量因此提高七倍。支部即协同工会，采取各种办法宣传推广该小组的先进经验，号召大家向床身组学习。床身组开检讨会时发动大家去旁听学习。现在床身小组的经验已推广到全厂，并被确定为行政制度之一。同时又涌现了床头、顶针、齿箱、溜板等模范小组。
    张尚举同志的工作中还有不少困难。主要是他兼职太多。张尚举同志除担负支部书记工作外，还担任工会生产委员、职工代表、工管会委员、新纪录委员、工薪委员等五职（厂外的还未计算）。因此他常常忙于开会，而不能集中精力在主要工作上，影响了他对业务的钻研和自己在生产上的进步。希望该厂领导上能尽量帮助他解决这一问题。
    最后，张尚举同志虚心地检讨说：“我思想上还有很多毛病：第一，还有个人英雄主义的残余思想，影响到对别人意见的考虑，可能有点主观。第二，深入下层接近群众还不够。以后我一定要克服这些缺点。”
