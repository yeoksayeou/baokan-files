　　The Jiusan Society Holds a Symposium
    Resolves to Drive the American Aggressors Out of Taiwan
    Determines that American Imperialism Will Fail to the End in Korea
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Jiusan Society held a symposium on July 21 to discuss the issue of American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Twenty-three people attended, including Xu Deheng. The opinions discussed at the symposium are summarized as follows:
    (1) American imperialism's launching of the war of aggression against Korea this time, and its obstruction of our country's liberation of Taiwan, is a desperate act after the policy of forcing the people of other countries to serve as cannon fodder has repeatedly failed. It has been forced to tear off all past masks and personally take the field. This is precisely a manifestation of its weakness.
    (2) The Lee Seung-man puppet bandit gang and American imperialism's direct, cruel oppression and barbaric massacre of the peaceful Korean people has further aroused the determination of the broad masses of Korean people to save themselves and achieve liberation. Although American imperialism has deployed its naval, air, and land forces, because its cause is unjust, its morale is depressed, and it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Taking the liberation wars of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as examples, no matter how many more troops the aggressors send, they will inevitably suffer another disgraceful defeat in Korea.
    (3) Whether viewed from a historical perspective, from international constraints, or from the established facts after the war, Taiwan is Chinese territory. American imperialism has brazenly torn up treaties and interfered in our country's liberation of Taiwan. Since the Chinese people were able to drive American imperialism out of the mainland in the past, then, in today's era of unprecedentedly strong peace camp, they will certainly be able to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan again.
    The symposium believed that we should strengthen our vigilance against the mad and adventurous behavior of American imperialism, but we should not overestimate it either. It also analyzed the economic crisis of American imperialism itself and the increasingly acute contradictions within the imperialist camp, especially between Britain and the United States. It believes that it is not easy for American monopoly capitalists to use the people at home and other subservient countries as cannon fodder to launch a world war for their own interests. The symposium believes that the power of the world peace and democracy camp is incomparably strong and can crush the instigators of war!
    The symposium finally pointed out that the heroic resistance of the Korean people, and the rising tide of anti-imperialist liberation wars in various colonies and semi-colonies, will inevitably accelerate the development of revolutionary forces within the imperialist countries, causing the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism to collapse rapidly.

　　九三学社举行座谈会
    决心把美国侵略者赶出台湾   
    认定美帝在朝鲜要失败到底
    【本报讯】九三学社于七月二十一日举行座谈会，讨论美帝侵略台湾朝鲜问题，出席许德珩等二十三人。座谈会中大家谈到的意见综合如下：
    （一）美帝此次发动对朝鲜侵略战争，并阻挠我国解放台湾，是在迫使其他国家人民充当炮灰的政策着着失败的情况下，不得已撕毁过去一切假面具，亲自出马，这正是它脆弱的表现。
    （二）李承晚傀儡匪帮和美帝直接对朝鲜和平人民的残酷压迫与野蛮屠杀，越发激起了朝鲜广大人民自救解放的决心。美帝虽出动了海空陆军，但因师出无名，士气沮丧，仍不免狼狈溃败。以中国和越南民主共和国解放战争为例，不管侵略者再加派若干军队，也必将在朝鲜再遭受一次可耻的失败。
    （三）台湾无论从历史看，从国际约束看，从战后既成事实看，都是中国的领土。美帝竟然公开撕毁条约，干涉我国解放台湾。中国人民过去既能把美帝赶出大陆，那么，在和平阵营力量空前壮大的今天，一定能够再把美帝赶出台湾。
    座谈会认为对美帝国主义的疯狂的冒险行为，应加强警惕性，但也不能对它估计过高。并分析了美帝本身的经济危机和帝国主义阵营内特别是英美之间日益尖锐化的矛盾。认为美国独占资本家要想为自己的利益，利用国内人民和其他仆从国家充当炮灰来发动世界大战颇不容易。座谈会认为：世界和平民主阵营的力量无比坚强，能够粉碎战争挑拨者！
    座谈会最后指出：朝鲜人民英勇的抗战，各殖民地半殖民地人民反帝解放战争的怒潮兴起，必将加速帝国主义国家内部革命力量的发展，使以美帝为首的侵略阵营，迅速地崩溃。
