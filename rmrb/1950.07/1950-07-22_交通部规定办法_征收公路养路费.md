　　Ministry of Communications Regulations
　　Levying Highway Maintenance Fees
    Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: The Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, in order to facilitate transportation and maintain highways, has drafted a unified national "Interim Measures for the Collection of Highway Maintenance Fees" and "Interim Measures for Highway Maintenance," which have been approved by the Government Administration Council for trial implementation.
    In the past, the methods for collecting highway maintenance fees varied greatly from place to place, and the fee collection procedures were extremely complicated. This not only caused inconvenience to vehicle owners and passengers, but also reduced driving speed, lengthened vehicle turnaround time, and reduced the volume of urban and rural material exchange transportation. Moreover, there were too many fee collectors and inspectors, wasting a large amount of manpower and financial resources. Similarly, in many areas, the methods for highway maintenance still used the old system from the Kuomintang rule era, establishing organizations such as general engineering sections and sub-sections, with large institutions, which also resulted in significant waste. The new measures of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government were formulated after research and discussion with relevant departments, based on the principle of "those who use the road maintain the road" established by the Government Administration Council. After the implementation of these two measures, the above-mentioned shortcomings can be overcome, procedures simplified, transportation facilitated, transportation volume stimulated, and highways well maintained.
    During the Kuomintang rule, the agencies collecting maintenance fees and the agencies maintaining highways were separate from each other. Maintenance fees were collected by management stations, while highway maintenance was the responsibility of engineering sections. This method was very unreasonable. The new measures have unified the agencies for collecting maintenance fees and the agencies for maintaining highways, establishing a highway management section on each section of the highway to uniformly carry out the work of collecting maintenance fees and maintaining highways. In this way, unified leadership and planning can be achieved, expenditures can be based on income, and highway maintenance work can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

　　交通部规定办法
    征收公路养路费
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府交通部为便利运输，养护公路，拟订了全国统一的《公路养路费征收暂行办法》和《养护公路暂行办法》，已经政务院批准试行。
    过去公路养路费征收办法，各地极不一致，收费的手续非常繁复，不但使车主与乘客都感麻烦，而且减低了行车速度，延长了车辆周转时间，减少了城乡物资交流的运输量，而且收费人员与检查人员过多，浪费大量人力和财力。同样，养护公路的办法很多地区也仍然是援用国民党统治时代的旧制度，设立工务总段、分段等组织，机构庞大，同样浪费很大。中央人民政府交通部的新办法是本着政务院确定的“用路者养路”的原则，与有关部门研究讨论后制订的。这两个办法实行后，可以克服上述缺点，简化手续，便利交通，刺激运输量，同时又能把公路养好。
    在国民党统治时期，征收养路费的机构与养护公路的机构是互相分离的，养路费由管理站负责征收，养护公路却由工务段负责。这种办法是很不合理的。新办法已将征收养路费的机构与养护公路的机构统一起来，在每段公路上设立一个公路管理段，统一进行征收养路费与养护公路的工作。这样就可以统一领导与计划，量入为出，有计划、有步骤地进行公路养护工作。
