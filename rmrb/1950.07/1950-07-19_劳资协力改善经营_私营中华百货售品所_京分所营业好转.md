    Private Zhonghua Department Store Sales Office
    Beijing Branch Sees Improved Business

    [This Newspaper reported] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The private Zhonghua Department Store Sales Office's Beijing retail branch has seen improved business under the government's care and with labor-management cooperation. The office opened in 1934, with its headquarters in Tianjin. It was a joint-stock company, formerly known as the "National Goods Sales Office." It advocated promoting national goods to resist Japanese goods and enjoyed a great reputation in major cities across the country. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, it was renamed the Department Store Sales Office. Due to currency inflation and rising prices, it appeared prosperous on the surface, but its strength gradually weakened. After the liberation of Beijing, the capitalists did not understand the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce and did not dare to operate freely, and business became increasingly sluggish.

    After prices stabilized in March of this year, there was a general market stagnation, and the office faced difficulties in capital turnover. On the other hand, high wages and large expenses led to insufficient income. The capitalists once encouraged employees to change careers. Although more than a dozen people changed careers, it did not reverse the loss-making situation. The capitalists completely lost confidence in management and planned to merge with the Tianjin Enterprise Company, intending to transfer the business to the Beijing Municipal Department Store Company. However, due to differing opinions among employees and conditions, the transfer was not realized. At that time, the capitalists had abandoned leadership in business operations, and employee morale was extremely low.

    In May, the Beijing Municipal People's Government adjusted industry and commerce and implemented a series of effective measures. The tax bureau, based on the specific situation, exempted part of the office's overdue taxes. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions educated the office's employees to assist the capitalists in overcoming difficulties. Employee morale began to change. Labor and management jointly examined the sales office's business operations and expenses, and found that the reasons for the losses were low business volume and high expenses. They concluded that only by "improving business methods, careful calculation, and increasing income and reducing expenditure" could they overcome the current difficulties. Subsequently, employee representatives held a conference, proposing to reduce wages; requesting the capitalists to reorganize the business, actively manage, improve business methods, and make business plans; and electing six business consultation committee members to formally exchange opinions with the capitalists. Under the influence of the employees' active efforts and the government's adjustment of industry and commerce, the capitalists eliminated their concerns and changed their negative mood. Labor and management elected representatives to form a business management committee. Labor and management agreed: to reduce wages by 30% to 50% under the principle of taking care of employees' lives, for a trial period of three months, and to study and formulate labor discipline and work systems; to make business plans and study future management methods. Labor and management eliminated past doubts and estrangement and basically achieved unity.

    Since June, market sales have improved, and the department store company has reasonably adjusted the difference between wholesale and retail prices, making private businesses profitable. The office has established a regular business relationship with the department store company and a consignment contract for 700 cool mats with the local products company; it has also established distribution relationships with more than 30 private factories. Business has gradually expanded and has undergone significant changes: in terms of sales, the average daily sales from January to May was 2 million yuan, and since June, the average daily sales has been more than 4 million yuan, reaching more than 8 million yuan on Sundays; in terms of purchases, it used to account for only 50% of sales, but in June, it has increased to 89% of sales. The morale of both labor and management has generally improved, and the work system is also beginning to become standardized. (Industry and Commerce Adjustment Working Group)

　　劳资协力改善经营
    私营中华百货售品所
    京分所营业好转
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：私营中华百货售品所北京零售分所在政府照顾与劳资协力经营下，营业已趋好转。该所于一九三四年开业，总所设天津，是股份有限公司，抗战前叫“国货售品所”，倡销国货抵制日货，在国内各大城市很有声望。在日伪统治时期改为百货售品所。由于通货膨胀，物价上涨，表面虽像繁荣，实力则日渐削弱。北京解放后，资方不了解政府保护工商业政策，不敢放手经营，业务愈益不振。
    今年三月物价稳定以后，市场普遍滞销，该所资金周转困难；另一方面工资高，开支大，因而入不敷出。资方曾鼓励职工转业。虽有十余人转业，但仍未扭转亏累情况。资方对经营完全丧失信心，遂计划与天津企业公司合营，想出倒给京市百货公司。由于职工意见纷歧，以及条件关系未能实现出倒。当时，资方已放弃了业务经营的领导，而职工情绪亦极为低落。
    五月份，京市人民政府调整工商业，实施了一连串的有效措施。税局根据具体情况，将该所滞纳的税款免掉一部。市总工会教育该所职工，要协助资方度过困难。职工情绪开始转变。劳资双方检查了售品所的营业和开支情况，找出了亏累原因是业务少，开支大，研究出只有“改善经营方法，精打细算，开源节流”才能克服目前困难。随着，职工代表召开了大会，提出减低工薪；要求资方重整业务，积极经营，改善经营方式，作出业务计划；选出了业务协商委员六人与资方正式交换意见。资方在职工积极努力与政府调整工商业的影响下，消除了顾虑，转变了消极情绪。劳资双方选出代表，成立业务管理委员会。劳资双方协议：在照顾职工生活的原则下减薪百分之三十至百分之五十，试行三个月，并研究制定劳动纪律和工作制度；作出了业务计划，研究今后的经营方法。劳资双方消除了以往的疑虑和隔膜，基本上作到了团结。
    六月份以来，市场销路情况好转，百货公司合理地调整了批发价与零售价的差额，私商经营有利可图。该所和百货公司建立了经常的业务关系，与土产公司建立了七百条凉席的代销合同；同时还和三十多家私营工厂建立了经销关系。业务逐渐开展，并已有显著变化：销货方面，一至五月份平均每天二百万元，六月以来平均每天四百万元以上，星期日能达到八百万元以上；进货方面，过去只占销货额的百分之五十，六月份已增加到占销货额百分之八十九。劳资双方情绪已普遍提高，工作制度亦开始走向正规。（调整工商业工作组）
