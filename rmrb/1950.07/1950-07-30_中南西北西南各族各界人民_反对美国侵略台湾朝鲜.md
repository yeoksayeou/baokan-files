    Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea
    Wuhan
    [This newspaper reports] The Central-South and Wuhan Municipal People's Committee to Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea was established on the 22nd. More than 1,000 representatives from various organs, organizations, and democratic parties attended the establishment meeting. Li Xuefeng, Minister of the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau, was elected as the chairman. The Central-South Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, the Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, the Central-Soviet Friendship Association General Branch and Wuhan Branch, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression Wuhan Branch, the Central-South Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles all issued declarations opposing American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Wuhan Changjiang Daily, Dagang Bao, and Central China Workers' News published news, editorials, and other articles on the anti-American imperialism aggression movement in various places in huge amounts on the 23rd. The Wuhan Suburban Work Committee, Hubei Provincial Direct Organs and various people's organizations, and enterprise units such as Enan Electric Power Company held seminars. Participants all expressed that they would step up production to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and support the Korean people. At the seminar held by the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee on July 20, the general deviations in the understanding of the anti-American aggression movement among the general new and old cadres and people of all strata of society were specially analyzed and pointed out. For example, the old cadres generally showed ideological paralysis, believing that imperialism was a paper tiger, and whether it was war or peace, they would eventually achieve victory. Therefore, they were not very concerned about international news such as the Korean War. Most of the new cadres underestimated the strength of the peaceful and democratic camp, and did not clearly understand the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of imperialism, especially American imperialism. Therefore, they were afraid of the outbreak of a third world war. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the people of all strata of society have specifically expressed concern about price fluctuations. As a result, phenomena such as rushing to purchase, hoarding, and withdrawing money from banks have occurred frequently. The seminar called on all units to carry out propaganda and education work well in response to these deviations. The local organizations of various democratic parties in Hubei and Wuhan, the Wuhan All Circles People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, and people from the business community all issued telegrams and written statements, expressing their determination to take practical actions to oppose the American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. All representatives of the 4th Congress of the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union issued a quick mail telegram on July 19, calling on all employees in the Hubei Telecommunications District to step up production, work actively, do a good job in the people's telecommunications business, support the front line, and liberate Taiwan. All employees of the Wuchang Post Office mimeographed propaganda slogans against American aggression and supporting the Korean people, and distributed them to business groups and affiliated branches, post kiosks, and agency offices, requiring that a propaganda slogan be pasted on every letter sent and received, so that people in every corner of the country can be vigilant and defeat the conspiracy of the American emperor and other imperialist war traffickers and robbers.
    Changsha
    The Hunan People's Movement Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea began on the 23rd. People from all walks of life in Hunan Province and Changsha City held a conference that morning. Tang Shengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, Huang Zhiyong, Director of the Political Department of the Hunan Military Region, and Xiao Minsong, the person in charge of the Hunan Branch of the China Democratic League, all spoke at the meeting. Changsha New Hunan Daily and Democracy Daily both published special editions on the 23rd. In addition to calling on all parts of the province to carry out propaganda activities, the Hunan People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea decided to focus on Changsha City and widely launch the movement against American imperialism through newspapers, radio, movies, comics, street propaganda, and mass rallies.
    Nanchang
    Jiangxi established a branch of the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea on the 18th. The Nanchang Municipal People's Organizations convened a preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 20th under the auspices of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to establish the Nanchang Branch. At the meeting, Huang Sen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Li Hong, Minister of Propaganda, called on all units to attach importance to this political task, carry out propaganda against American aggression against Taiwan and Korea to the broad masses, and specifically combine it with exposing the rumors of special agents. Finally, in addition to inviting Peng Jialun, Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, to give a special report on the 22nd, it was also decided to hold a demonstration parade on "August 1st."
    Zhengzhou
    The Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions invited representatives from more than ten units, including the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Youth League Committee, the Bureau of Culture and Education, and the Zhengzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, on July 15 to form the "Zhengzhou Branch of the Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea," and set July 17 to 23 as the Propaganda Movement Week. Beginning on the 17th, the people of Zhengzhou City were plunged into a wave of anti-American aggression. Slogans, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, comics, red and green slogans, and radios with large red cloth banners were all over the intersections of the city. Waist drum teams, Yangko teams, lecture teams, and street play teams appeared simultaneously in every corner of the streets and alleys. 184,264 peace-loving Zhengzhou citizens have signed the peace declaration, accounting for 80% of the city's total population. After the propaganda and mobilization of "July 1st" and "July 7th," the political awareness of the city's people has generally improved. As soon as the call for anti-American aggression was issued, public and private groups, schools, organs, troops, etc. in the city held meetings or seminars. People from all walks of life were extremely angry about the US imperialist aggression. The workers expressed that they must sweat more and produce more. The farmers are determined to pay public grain quickly and pay good grain, and said that they must unite and fight against American imperialism like fighting against local tyrants in the countryside. Soldiers of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army raised their rough fists and shouted in the tone of dealing with the enemy on the battlefield: "Let you (referring to American imperialism) see how powerful we are!" The women heard that the US imperialists were beaten badly in Korea, and happily said: "When we fight Taiwan in the future, he will be even worse!" "We hurry up and make good soles to support our army." Students, artists, and businessmen all believe that the US imperialists' aggression will definitely fail, and no one can stop us from liberating Taiwan. The citizens of Zhengzhou City have seen through the paper tiger of the American emperor, who has few legs and no arms. It has been beaten to pieces by the Korean people, and it can't withstand the iron fist of the Chinese people. The anti-American aggression movement in Zhengzhou City has been launched enthusiastically in the city and suburbs.
    Shaanzhou
    The Shaanzhou District Special Direct Agency convened an expanded cadre meeting on the morning of July 23. At the meeting, Commissioner Liu gave a report, analyzing the Korean war situation in detail. It was pointed out that from the current comparison of forces and the evidence of history, the imperialist armed aggression will inevitably be shamefully defeated, and the final victory must belong to the Korean people. In the report, it was emphasized that the Korean War is not the beginning of the Third World War, and that we are not afraid of war. If the imperialists dare to launch the Third World War, we also have enough power to eliminate war with war. Finally, he called on all cadres to work hard and widely publicize their support for the Korean people in their struggle to stop American aggression. It was also decided that July 23 to July 29 would be the Propaganda Movement Week against American Imperialist Aggression. After the meeting, various agencies have organized groups to go to the countryside to carry out publicity work.

    The Guangdong Provincial Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea has also been established.
