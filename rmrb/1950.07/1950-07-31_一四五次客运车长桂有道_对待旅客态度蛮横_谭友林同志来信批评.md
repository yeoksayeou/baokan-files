　　Passenger Train Conductor Gui Youdao of Train 145
    Has a Rude Attitude Towards Passengers
    Comrade Tan Youlin Writes a Letter of Criticism

Editor Comrades:

    At 14:10 on the 8th of this month, train No. 145 departed from Zhengzhou South. At Heshangqiao, Sun Tusheng, a villager from Changge County, wanted to go to Xuchang (45 *li* from Xuchang). Due to the short stop time (3 minutes), he did not have time to buy a ticket and boarded the train first. After boarding, Sun immediately took the initiative to find conductor Gui Youdao to purchase a supplementary ticket. In addition to a handling fee of 2,300 yuan, Gui Youdao demanded a fine of 8,000 yuan from Sun Tusheng. Because Sun Tusheng could not pay this fine, Conductor Gui rudely said, "If you don't pay the fine, the penalty will be even heavier." At the time, I, along with Guo Chengzhu, director of the political department of a certain military unit, and Jiang Yonghui, staff officer of a certain military unit, were present. We believed that since this fellow villager did not have time to buy a ticket and took the initiative to buy a supplementary ticket after boarding (not intentionally avoiding buying a ticket), it was unreasonable to impose a fine. We stepped forward to mediate. Unexpectedly, the conductor not only refused mediation but also said, "This is the railway regulation. We serve the people, and fines are to increase national wealth, not for my personal corruption." Director Guo asked, "Why was I only charged a handling fee and not fined when I bought a supplementary ticket after boarding from the Northeast this time?" Gui Youdao replied, "The Northeast is different from Guanli (inside the Pass)." Despite our repeated persuasion and the repeated pleas of the villager, Gui Youdao unreasonably refused and insisted on imposing the fine, which had a very bad impact on the people. In the end, because Sun really had no money with him, we paid 13,000 yuan on his behalf to settle the matter.

    I believe that if the railway regulations only stipulate that passengers found without a ticket during ticket inspection should be fined, then Gui Youdao's mechanical application of the railway regulations this time is completely wrong. Although he also repeatedly said that he was serving the people, serving the people is concrete, not abstract. Can Gui Youdao's bureaucratic style of oppressing the people under the pretext of railway regulations be considered "serving the people"? If Gui Youdao's bad practices are not strictly corrected, it will greatly affect the credibility of the people's railway among the people. I request the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to thoroughly investigate this matter, provide a reply, and strictly educate and criticize Gui Youdao, ordering him to make a public self-criticism in the *People's Daily*.

                    Tan Youlin, 39th Army, Fourth Field Army, July 11th

    Editor's Note: The attitude of Gui Youdao, conductor of train No. 145 on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, towards passenger Sun Tusheng is completely wrong. His mistake is: taking advantage of railway regulations, abusing his power, and arbitrarily oppressing passengers who legally purchase supplementary tickets. This has nothing in common with the service spirit that the staff of the people's railway should have. All staff members of the People's Government have certain powers in their work posts, but this power is given by the people and serves the people. Abusing power against the people is serious and shameful for staff members of the People's Government. It is hoped that Comrade Gui Youdao will conduct a sincere self-criticism on this matter.

### 一四五次客运车长桂有道  对待旅客态度蛮横  谭友林同志来信批评

　　一四五次客运车长桂有道
    对待旅客态度蛮横
    谭友林同志来信批评编辑同志：
    本月八日十四时十分，第一四五号列车由郑州南开，到了和尚桥，有长葛县老百姓孙途生要去许昌（离许昌四十五华里）。因停车时间短促（三分钟），来不及购票，他即先行登车。上车后孙即主动找车长桂有道进行补票，桂有道除要孙途生手续费二千三百元外，还要罚款八千元。孙途生因付不出这笔罚款，桂车长即蛮横地说：“不付罚款，更要加重的罚。”当时我和某军政治部主任郭成柱及某军参谋长江拥辉等同志都在场，认为这位老乡因来不及购票，上车后自动补票（并非有意不买车票），再要罚款，太不合理，就出面调解。不料该车长不但不服调解，反而说：“这是铁路规章。我们是为人民服务的，罚款是为了增加国家财富，并非我个人贪污。”郭主任提出：“为什么我这次由东北南来时也是上车后补票，只付手续费，不要罚款呢？”桂有道即说：“东北和关里不同。”虽经我们再三的劝说和该老百姓的几次求告，都被桂有道无理拒绝，并坚持一定要罚，给老百姓影响极坏。最后因孙实未带钱，只好由我们代付一万三千元，才算了结。
    我认为：如果路章只是规定在检票时发现旅客无票才予罚款，则桂有道这次机械地搬运路章，是完全错误的。虽然他也口口声声地说为人民服务，但为人民服务是具体的，而不是抽象的。桂有道这种借口路章，欺压老百姓的浓厚的官僚主义作风，能算是“为人民服务”吗？对于桂有道的这种不良作风如不严格纠正，则会大大的影响人民铁路在人民中的威信。以上问题请郑州路局彻底查究，予以答复，并应对桂有道进行严格的教育和批评，令其在人民日报上作公开的检讨。
                    四野三十九军  谭友林七月十一日
    编者按：京汉路第一四五号列车车长桂有道对待旅客孙途生的态度是完全错误的。他的错误是：借口路章，滥用职权，任意压迫依法补票的乘客，这与人民铁路上的工作人员应有的服务精神，毫无共同之点。人民政府的一切工作人员，均在工作岗位上有一定的权力，但是，这个权力是人民所赋予，而又为人民服务的。对人民滥用权力，在人民政府工作人员来说，其性质是严重的，是可耻的，希望桂有道同志对此作切实的检讨。
