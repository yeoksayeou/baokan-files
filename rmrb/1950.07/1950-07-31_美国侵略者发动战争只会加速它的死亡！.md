　　American Aggressors Launching War Will Only Accelerate Their Demise!
    Qian Sanqiang
    American imperialists, under the guise of the "United Nations Commission on Korea," used every despicable means to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea. Their plot failed, and their plan to turn the entire Korean peninsula into a bridgehead for aggression against the Soviet Union and China became a fantasy. Finally, incited by warmongers MacArthur, Bradley, and others, they launched the anti-popular Syngman Rhee clique to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This month of war clearly shows that, even with external support, all anti-popular wars will follow the example of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and ultimately fail.

    The imperialists know that their doomsday is approaching day by day. Before the doomsday arrives, they still hold onto a glimmer of hope, trying to weaken the socialist or people's democratic countries, whose systems are absolutely superior to their own. This time, launching the Korean War and taking this opportunity to rob and occupy our country's Taiwan, and obstructing Taiwan's liberation, is precisely this kind of fantasy before the arrival of their doomsday.

    We believe that all of Korea will be liberated at superspeed; Taiwan will also be seized from the hands of the war criminals by our indomitable and heroic People's Liberation Army. If the mad imperialists dare to expand the scope of the war, we can tell them that the end result of all anti-popular wars is failure! The earlier the war is launched, the earlier the date of the imperialists' annihilation will be brought forward!

　　美国侵略者发动战争只会加速它的死亡！
    钱三强
    美国帝国主义者借“联合国朝鲜委员会”的幌子，用一切卑劣的手段去阻挠朝鲜的和平统一的阴谋失败了，使他把全部朝鲜变成侵略苏联和中国的桥头堡的计划变成幻想。最后在战争贩子麦克阿瑟、布莱德雷等的策动下，发动了反人民的韩奸李承晚集团来攻击朝鲜人民共和国。这一个月的战争很明显的表示：虽在外力支持之下，一切反人民战争的结果都将追随蒋介石匪帮的前例一般最后失败。
    帝国主义者知道自己的末日一天天的近了，在末日到来前，还抱着一线幻想，想试着减弱比自己制度绝对优良的社会主义的或人民民主的国家。这次发动朝鲜战争与借这个机会强盗般的想占领我国的台湾与阻碍台湾的解放，就是这种末日来到前的幻想。
    我们相信：全朝鲜会超速度的得到解放；台湾亦将由我们百折不挠的英勇解放军由战犯手中夺回。假如疯狂的帝国主义者敢扩大战争范围的话，我们可以告诉他，一切反人民的战争终结是失败的下场！战争发动的越早，帝国主义者被消灭的日期即越加提前！
