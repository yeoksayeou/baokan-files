Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League has issued the following statement regarding Truman's challenging statement on June 27th:

After instigating the South Korean puppet government of Syngman Rhee to provoke the Korean civil war, Truman, the executor of US imperialism, issued a statement on the 27th, announcing that the US government has decided to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, to join the war on the side of South Korea, and to accelerate its aggressive actions against the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries. This statement thoroughly exposes the consistent conspiracy of US imperialism to be hostile to the Chinese and Asian people, and further reveals the bandit-like features of imperialism. It violates the principles of the United Nations Charter regarding any member state not infringing upon the territorial integrity and political independence of any country, and violates the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration regarding the return of Taiwan and other islands to China. This is an open act of armed aggression, a more shameless and blatant direct attack by US imperialism on the Chinese and Asian people, destroying peace in the Far East.

The Chinese youth resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of June 28th and are determined to fight for the realization of this solemn statement.

The Chinese youth, who have grown up in war, deeply understand from the experience of the Chinese revolution that although US imperialism is extremely vicious, it is also a paper tiger that appears strong but is actually weak. The great power of the Chinese and Asian people is fully capable of shattering the arrogant aggressive dreams of US imperialism. We should resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, fully prepare ourselves, and strive to repel any provocation by US imperialism; at the same time, we call on the youth of all oppressed nations in the East to rise up together and, together with all peace-loving people in the Far East and the world, stop the new aggression of US imperialism in the East.

　　青年团中央发表声明
    严斥杜鲁门挑战阴谋
    号召东方各被压迫民族青年制止美帝在东方的新侵略
    【新华社三十日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会顷就杜鲁门六月二十七日的挑战声明发表声明如下：
    美国帝国主义的执行人杜鲁门在指使南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府挑起朝鲜内战之后，二十七日又发表声明，宣布美国政府决定以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾，以武力加入南朝鲜方面作战，并加速对菲律宾、越南等国的侵略行动。这个声明，彻底暴露了美国帝国主义一贯的与中国及亚洲人民为敌的阴谋计划，更进一步地显露出帝国主义的强盗面目。它破坏了联合国宪章关于任何会员国不得侵害任何国家领土完整与政治独立的原则，违反了开罗宣言和波茨坦宣言关于台湾等岛交还中国的决定。这是一种公开的武装侵略行为，这是美国帝国主义破坏远东和平、更无耻和更露骨地向中国和亚洲人民的直接进攻。
    中国青年坚决拥护周恩来外长六月二十八日的声明，并决心为这个庄严声明的实现而奋斗。
    在战争中成长起来的中国青年，由中国革命的经验，深深认识到美国帝国主义虽然穷凶极恶，但同时却是外强中干的一只纸老虎。中国和亚洲人民的伟大力量，是完全能够粉碎美国帝国主义的狂妄的侵略迷梦的。我们应当坚决响应毛主席的号召，充分准备起来，为打退美国帝国主义的任何挑衅而奋斗；同时并号召东方各被压迫民族的青年，一致奋起，和远东以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民一道，制止美国帝国主义在东方的新侵略。
