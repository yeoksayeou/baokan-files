Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 27th: Thirty-two prominent Korean writers, artists, and scholars, including Han Sorya, jointly published an open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 25th, protesting the United States' armed intervention in Korean internal affairs and Lie's shameful behavior of aiding the tyrant. The letter stated:

　　We, the writers, artists, and scholars of Korea, resolutely oppose and protest the United States' armed intervention in Korea. At the same time, we believe that United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie's vigorous assistance to American imperialism's armed intervention in Korean internal affairs is very shameful.

　　In order to carry out its aggression against Korea and other regions of the Far East, American imperialism, according to its long-planned sinister plot, instigated the Syngman Rhee puppet army to launch a fratricidal civil war on June 25th this year, and mobilized its own long-prepared army, navy, and air force to begin direct armed intervention in Korea.

　　American imperialists are using inhumane and barbaric methods to carry out beastly bombings of cities and villages, indiscriminately massacring peaceful residents, regardless of the old, weak, women, and children. Mr. Lie: Do you think this barbaric bombing and massacre is in accordance with the United Nations Charter?

　　The United States is using the Security Council as a tool for aggression against Korea, and you, Mr. Lie, are actively engaging with various countries to stifle the Korean people and to transport more weapons to Korea, are you not? When your negotiations were unfortunately unsuccessful, did you not specifically call for sending troops to Korea again? When MacArthur, the executioner of the Korean people, was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the armed intervention in Korea, you sent a telegram congratulating him, wishing success to this executioner who turned Korea into a sea of blood. When MacArthur's staff, in order to intimidate soldiers, falsely reported that the Korean People's Army was massacring American prisoners, you quickly echoed them. Without investigating the truth of this false report, you tried hard to spread this fabrication by MacArthur's staff widely.

　　In our opinion, you are not concerned with the facts; it seems that the fabrications of your American masters are more important than the facts. You are completely spinning under the manipulation of your American masters.

　　Mr. Lie, you also talk about "humanitarianism" like the American imperialists, but you must know that your so-called "humanitarianism" is all lies. American imperialists are using aerial bombardment and naval shelling to flatten unarmed cities and villages in Korea, indiscriminately killing peaceful residents regardless of men, women, old, and young. This is your so-called humanitarianism. Mr. Lie, this is not humanitarianism, but the atrocities of imperialist plunderers who oppress weak nations.

　　The morality and truth of justice and humanitarianism are on the side of us, the Korean people, who are fighting for the freedom and independence of our motherland. Precisely for this reason, the progressive mankind of the world is today sympathizing with and supporting us.

　　Mr. Lie: Only by taking emergency measures to stop the American imperialist armed intervention in Korea can you be considered to have completed the task of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

### 朝鲜文化工作者致函赖伊  抗议美帝侵略朝鲜  痛斥赖伊为虎作伥

　　朝鲜文化工作者致函赖伊
    抗议美帝侵略朝鲜  痛斥赖伊为虎作伥
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜著名作家、艺术家和学者韩雪野等三十二人，于二十五日联名发表致联合国秘书长赖伊的公开信，抗议美国武装干涉朝鲜内政，及赖伊为虎作伥的可耻行为。该信略称：
    我们朝鲜的作家，艺术家和学者们，坚决反对并抗议美国对朝鲜的武装干涉。同时，我们认为联合国秘书长赖伊极力帮助美帝国主义对朝鲜内政的武装干涉，是很可耻的。
    美帝国主义为了进行对朝鲜和其他远东地区的侵略，按照其早已策划好的阴险诡计，于今年六月二十五日，唆使李承晚伪军发动了同族相残的内战，并动员自己早已准备好的陆海空军，对我朝鲜开始了直接的武力干涉。
    美帝国主义者以残无人道的野蛮方法，对我国大小城市和农村进行兽性轰炸，盲目地屠杀着和平居民，不管老弱妇孺。赖伊先生：难道你认为这一野蛮的轰炸和屠杀是符合于联合国宪章的行为吗？
    美国把安理会当成侵略朝鲜的工具，而赖伊先生你为了窒息朝鲜人民，为了多往朝鲜运送武器，不是和各国积极进行活动吗？当你的交涉不幸不顺利时，你不是又特别再次号召向朝鲜运送军队吗？当朝鲜人民的刽子手——麦克阿瑟被任命为武装干涉朝鲜的总司令时，你曾致电庆贺，祝福这一位将朝鲜变成血海的刽子手的成功。当麦克阿瑟的参谋部，为了恫吓士兵，虚妄地报道朝鲜人民军屠杀美国俘虏时，你就很快地作了应声虫。你毫不调查这一虚妄报道的真相，就努力企图把麦克阿瑟参谋部的这种捏造，广泛地传播出去。
    在我们看来，你对事实是不关心的，对你说来，似乎美国主子的捏造比事实重要得多。你完全在你的美国主子的操纵下旋转。
    赖伊先生，你也和美帝国主义者同样地好说“人道主义”，但是你必须知道，你们所说的“人道主义”，都是撒谎。美帝国主义者用空军的轰炸和舰队的炮击来炸平朝鲜非武装的城市和农村，不分男女老幼地乱杀和平居民，这就是你们所谓的人道主义。赖伊先生，这不是人道主义，而是压迫弱小民族的帝国主义掠夺者的暴行。
    正义和人道主义的道德及真理，是在为自己祖国的自由独立而斗争的我们朝鲜人民方面。正因为如此，今天全世界的进步人类都在同情和声援我们。
    赖伊先生：你只有采取停止美帝国主义对朝鲜武装干涉的紧急措施，方能算是完成联合国秘书长的任务。
