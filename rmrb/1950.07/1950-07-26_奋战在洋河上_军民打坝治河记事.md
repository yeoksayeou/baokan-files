Fighting on the Yang River
    ——A Record of the Army and People Building Dams and Controlling the River
    Wen Qun, Yu Zhi

“If we harvest the river滩land, we will have enough to eat and good clothes to wear; if we lose the river滩land, everyone will go hungry.” This is a saying passed down through generations in Dahuangzhuang, Huailai, Chahar Province. Indeed, the river滩land is the main source of livelihood for the villagers of Dahuangzhuang. Dahuangzhuang is located on the north bank of the Yang River. To the north, west, and east of the village is a stretch of yellow sand. Only the more than 6,000 mu of 滩land along the Yang River to the south of the village is fertile. In normal years, each mu can produce two shi of rice. Relying on this, the whole village has no worries about food and clothing. However, during the time of the Kuomintang, due to heavy taxation and extortion, the river dams were in disrepair for many years. The floods of the Yang River swallowed and submerged countless mu of 滩land. Many fertile fields became part of the riverbed, and many fertile fields became wasteland. Over the years, only more than 3,000 mu of land remained. Last autumn, the river flooded, and more than 500 mu of seedlings were submerged before the harvest. Fortunately, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army assisted in the emergency repairs, preventing a major disaster. This year, after the ice melted in March, more than 50 mu of newly reclaimed land was washed away in two days. Since May, the water level has been rising continuously. According to experienced old farmers, if the dams are not repaired and the river is not controlled this year, a large part of the more than 4,000 mu of 滩land along the river will be in danger of being washed away, and even the high ground near the village will be difficult to escape. For the sake of the people of Dahuangzhuang and for the construction of the country, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed here, which had assisted in emergency repairs last year, took the initiative to propose building dams and controlling the river this spring. This is a complex and arduous task. The dam is 7,500 chi long, 2 meters wide, and 1.7 meters high. It also requires 48 large and small "mouths," totaling 12,000 workdays, 2,140 wooden stakes, and more than 30,000 bundles of straw and willow branches. For these, Regiment Commander Wang and Political Commissar Li of the division made detailed plans, repeatedly invited the directors of the water conservancy bureaus of the special commissioner's office and the Huailai and Zhuolu counties to repeatedly discuss, organized a river management committee, and solved the material difficulties.

The official start of construction was on May 19th. The agricultural production unit of the regiment, after just finishing land reclamation and sowing, immediately went to the banks of the Yang River to fight the floods again. Rain and wind never stopped the work, striving to complete it before the summer floods, and there was no rest on Sundays. Piling and damming, coming from the mud, going into the water, pulling up this foot, and then sinking into that foot. The troops transporting timber went to places four or five li away, each carrying nearly a hundred jin of timber, making six or seven round trips a day. There is no main road in the 滩land, and rice and broad beans are planted in the fields. The soldiers carrying timber were unwilling to walk through the fields to take shortcuts, and they all walked on the winding, narrow, and muddy rice paddy ridges. They would rather go the long way and be more tired, falling and getting up again, than step on a single seedling. Shoulders were red and swollen, feet were bleeding, fatigue and sleepiness plagued every comrade, but when everyone thought of the poverty of the old folks in Dahuangzhuang last year, they immediately forgot their fatigue, increased their courage, and became more active and tense. Huang Yichen, a correspondent from the regiment headquarters, fell into a dry canal in a heavy rain one day. The timber he was carrying hit his foot and blood was flowing, but he didn't care and carried the timber to its destination. Regiment Commander Wang stood in the water all day directing, putting this down and picking that up, never idle for a day. The active actions of the troops deeply moved the old folks in Dahuangzhuang. In the beginning, some people were still watching and lacking confidence, but later they all changed and joined the river management upsurge. Everyone said one after another: "We will never forget the People's Liberation Army!" "They (referring to the troops) are moving for us, why shouldn't we move!" These are words spoken from the heart. Men, women, old men, and children were all organized. At first, only a hundred people participated, then it increased to more than three hundred, and now it has increased to more than five hundred. As soon as the morning bell rang, the whole village got up; the second ring was for eating; the third ring was for departure. In the evening, the roof of the elementary school broadcast and the blackboard bulletin praised the models of the day. The villagers are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and that kind of working people's true color has profoundly educated the troops. Niu Pu, the village's industrial committee member, took the lead in leading this project from the beginning, running east and west, working during the day, and holding meetings at night. His mouth was so tired that it was burning, but he still insisted on working. Zhao Fa, who was over fifty years old, had sores on his legs. In order not to waste labor, he went to the river early every day to inspect the terrain and plan the day's work. Many commanders and fighters asked: "Write about the villagers, the villagers are more vivid than us!"

On May 29th, at dawn, the flood broke through the new dam, more than a hundred meters wide, and the water swallowed the wasteland and the rice fields. Rescue! All personnel were mobilized, transporting timber, transporting grass, and many people automatically jumped into the water, using their bodies to block the waves and build the dam. It was raining heavily, people's clothes were soaked, and their whole bodies were cold, but they did not shrink back. From 7:00 in the morning to 7:30 in the evening, they finally successfully repaired it.

After two weeks of hard work, the task was successfully completed.

　　奋战在洋河上
    ——军民打坝治河记事
    文群　玉智
    “收了河滩地，吃饱饭，穿好衣；没了河滩地，大家饿肚皮。”这是察南怀来大黄庄世世代代流传的一句话。的确，河滩地是大黄庄村民生活的主要靠山。大黄庄在洋河北岸，村北、村西、村东都是一片黄沙，只有村南顺着洋河的六千多亩滩地肥沃。平常年景，每亩可产稻子两石，靠着这些，全村即不愁吃穿。但因国民党在时，横征暴敛，河坝年久失修，洋河的洪涛吞噬和淹没了无数亩滩地，不少良田变成了河身，不少良田变成了荒滩，年来只剩下三千余亩地。去年秋季河水泛滥，五百余亩青苗又被淹没，籽粒未收。幸亏人民解放军某团协助抢修，未成巨灾。今年三月冰解后，两天内又被卷去新开出的田地五十余亩。五月份以来，水位不断上涨。据有经验的老农说：如果今年再不修坝治河，沿河四千余亩滩地，有大部被卷走的危险，连村边的高地也难脱险。为了大黄庄人民，为了国家的建设，去年曾协助抢修的驻军解放军某团，今春又主动发起了打坝治河的建议。这是一件复杂艰巨的任务。坝全长七千五百尺，二公尺宽，一·七公尺高，还要大小嘴子四十八个，共需一万二千个工，木桩二千一百四十根，稻草、柳枝三万余捆。为了这些，该团王团长和师李政委曾作了详细的计划，数次邀请专署及怀来、涿鹿两县水利局长等再三座谈，组织了治河委员会，解决了物资上的困难。
    五月十九日正式开工。该团农业生产部队在刚开荒播种完毕后，立即开赴洋河畔又与洪水搏斗。下雨、刮风，从未停过工，争取在夏洪前完成，星期日也不休息。打桩、筑坝，泥里来，水里去，拔起这只脚，又陷进去那只脚。运木料的部队，到四、五里以外的地方，每个人扛着近百斤的木料，一天来回六七趟。滩地无大道，田里又都种上稻和蚕豆，战士们扛着木料谁也不肯走田里抄直，都在弯曲狭窄泞滑的稻田埂上走。宁肯绕远道累一些，滑倒再爬起来，也不曾踏过一棵禾苗。肩膀红肿了，脚上出血了，累和困侵袭着每个同志，但当大家想起了去年大黄庄老乡受穷困的情景时，立即忘掉了疲劳，增加了勇气，更积极紧张了。团部通讯员黄义臣，在一天大雨中，掉到干渠里，扛着的木料把他的脚碰的直淌鲜血，他毫不在意的又扛起了木料送到了目的地。王团长成天站在水里指挥，放下这，又拿起那，一天也不闲。部队的积极行动，深深地感动了大黄庄的老乡。开始，有部分人还在观望，缺乏信心，后来都变了，都卷入治河热潮。大家纷纷地说：“永远也忘不了解放军！”“人家（指部队）给咱们动，咱们为什么不动呀！”这是从心里吐出来的话。男人、妇女、老头、小孩，都组织起来了，起初只参加百余人，后来增至三百多，现在又增到五百多了。晨钟一响，全村都起床；二次响，吃饭；三次响出发。傍晚时，小学校的屋顶广播、黑板报表扬当天的模范。老乡们不怕苦，不怕累，那种劳动人民的本色又深刻的教育了部队。村实业委员牛璞，一开始就积极领导这一工程，跑东跑西，白天作工，晚上还要开会，劳累的嘴都烧破了，仍坚持着工作。五十多岁的赵发，腿上长着连疮，为了不浪费劳动力，每天提前去河上视察地形，计划当天的工作。好多指战员都要求说：“把老乡写一写吧，老乡比我们生动多啦！”
    五月二十九日那天拂晓，洪水冲破了新坝，有一百多米宽，水吞没了荒滩，吞没了稻田。抢险啊！全体人员都动员起来了，运木材的，运草的，不少人自动地跳到水里，用身子挡着水浪筑坝。天上下着倾盆大雨，人们衣服都湿透了，混身透凉，但没有畏缩，从早上七时到晚上七时半，终于胜利补修好了。
    经过两周的奋战，顺利的完成了任务。
