Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: The Xinjiang Provincial People's Democratic League General Association sent a telegram to the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, expressing opposition to American aggression against Korea and interference in China's Taiwan Province. The telegram stated: "This reactionary behavior of American imperialism has disrupted peace in the Far East and fully exposed its ferocious face, willingly antagonizing peace-loving people. This aggressive act of further interfering in Asian affairs can only arouse the indignation and forceful resistance of the Chinese people and the people of other countries." The telegram also stated: "We, representing members of all ethnic groups and sectors in Xinjiang, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely oppose the American imperialists' armed obstruction of our liberation of Taiwan; and call on the people of all ethnic groups and sectors throughout Xinjiang to unite more closely, defend democracy, defend peace, oppose aggression, and fully support the liberation of Taiwan."
