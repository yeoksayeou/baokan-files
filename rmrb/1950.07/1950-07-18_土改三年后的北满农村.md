　　"To abolish the feudal exploitation of the landlord class's land ownership and implement the peasant's land ownership, thereby liberating rural productive forces, developing agricultural production, and paving the way for the industrialization of New China."
　　--General Principles of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China

　　Recently, I visited the rural areas on the northern Manchurian grasslands. From this village to that village, every village has a fresh name: Liberation Village, Emancipation Village, Democracy Village, Prosperity Village... Upon inquiring, I found that these fresh village names were all created by the peasants themselves during the land reform. "Now that the village belongs to us, we have to give it our own name," the peasants said. In the past, even the villages belonged to the landlords: if the Zhang family landlord lived in this village, it was called Zhang Family Compound; if the Li family landlord lived in another village, he called it Li Family Village. Peasants had no land of their own, no houses of their own, and couldn't even say which village they were from. They didn't know when they would be driven out by the landlord with a stick. Living in the village was like staying at an inn – even worse than staying at an inn. They toiled until their backs were broken and their waists were bent, yet they couldn't get enough to eat or wear all year round. Now they are liberated, emancipated, democratic, and becoming prosperous. The peasants are starting a new life, and the countryside has its own new names.
　　"We have changed from slaves with nothing to eat or wear to masters of a prosperous new society," said Wang Zhijian, a agricultural labor hero from Heilongjiang Province, in his letter to Chairman Mao reporting on production this "July 1st." He and nine other people in his village organized a mutual-aid production team and cultivated 30 *qing* (Note: each *qing* is 3,600 square steps, equal to 15 Chinese *mu*) of wasteland this year. Now each person in his team farms an average of 10 *qing* of land. This spring, the People's Government lent them a complete set of Soviet-style animal-drawn new farm tools, which increased their productivity. This year's crops will be weeded five times and earthed up five times, "guaranteeing that each laborer will harvest 55 *shi* of grain" (calculated using standard grain – sorghum, each *shi* is 450 *jin*). In his letter to Chairman Mao, he said, "Strive for 60 *shi*." Old Wang is from Guoyu Village in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province. In the past, 223 out of 300 households in his village had no land or houses, and 14 landlord families occupied almost half of the land. After the land reform in 1947, through two or three years of active labor, seven out of ten families in the village are living a well-fed and well-clothed middle-peasant life. In the past two years, the village has built 23 new houses, bought 95 horses and 80 carts, and reclaimed more than 120 *qing* of wasteland. Last year's crops grew well, yielding 4.48 *shi* per *qing*, which is 1.26 *shi* more than in 1945. No wonder everyone in Guoyu Village is now dressed neatly. Last year alone, the village bought more than 380 bolts of cloth, averaging more than 2.8 *zhang* per person, counting adults and children. Take Li Deming, for example. He used to be a long-term laborer for the landlord, so poor that he had nothing and had to "borrow grain to survive" all year round. Now he has more than 10 *qing* of land, two horses, and a cart, and he has married a good wife. He is living a happy and harmonious life.
　　People are saying that after the land reform, "the land's spirit has also changed." Who can deny it? Take Sihetun, where Wang Zhentang of Agricultural Village, Zhaoyuan County, lives. In 1947, 72 *qing* of land yielded 179 *shi* of grain. The next year, the same land yielded 480 *shi*. Last year, despite a severe drought, "the year was really bad!" but the harvest was still higher than the previous year, yielding 510 *shi*. Wang Zhentang, who worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for 32 years, knows this best. He said that in the past, he worked for the landlord, toiling desperately all year round, but in the end, he was still cold and hungry. So he became lazy in farming, deliberately weeding out good seedlings and leaving the bad ones, and happily resting when he broke the hoe. How could the crops grow well? Now, the more he harvests, the more he keeps for himself, so everyone is putting in all their effort.
　　I visited the village in the afternoon, and because I had been traveling all day, I was very tired and went to bed early. I had just fallen asleep when Old Wang woke me up, saying it was time for breakfast. I looked at my watch and it was only four o'clock. I was surprised, but since it was my first time in a rural area of northern Manchuria, and I didn't know the local people's habits, I had to get up. I walked on the street – it was deserted, with not a single person in sight. I looked at the houses – they were all quiet and closed. I thought, "Everyone is still asleep, but Old Wang woke me up for breakfast." I wanted to ask several times, but I held back. Two days later, I found out that the villagers eat breakfast "before dawn" and go to the fields as soon as it gets light. The day before, Old Wang had specially taken care of me by letting me have breakfast at four o'clock. Unlike in North China, the farmers here do not have the habit of "taking a midday break." They go home for lunch, and immediately go back to the fields. They don't return until around eight o'clock in the evening, when it's already dark. I calculated that the farmers here work at least sixteen hours a day. I asked Yu Changjiang, the village party secretary, about this, wondering if it would affect their health in the long run. He said, "The landlords used to force us to work even harder than this! Now we're working for ourselves, so it doesn't matter if we're a little tired. We'll take it easy when things get better, but we can't slack off now!"
　　The liberated peasants, working on their own land for the first time, have a very high level of enthusiasm for production. They work diligently from dawn till dusk, forgetting their fatigue, and creating their own happy life. They carefully "tend" their land, cultivating it deeply and meticulously. They work hard to reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area. Therefore, the peasants' grain harvests are increasing year by year. In 1945, Xishengli Village in Bei'an County had 196 *qing* of land and harvested 523 *shi* of grain. Last year, they expanded the cultivated area to 403 *qing* and produced 1,740 *shi* of grain. The cultivated area increased by more than one time, but the grain production increased by two and three-tenths times. Keshan County produced 680,000 *shi* of grain the year before last, increased to 740,000 *shi* last year, and will increase to 840,000 *shi* this year. In Heilongjiang Province as a whole, the year of land reform, the average grain yield per *qing* was 1,500 *jin*. The next year, it was 1,800 *jin*. Last year, despite the drought, it still increased to 2,000 *jin*.
　　In order to further improve agricultural production, the Northeast People's Government is using a lot of money this year to promote new agricultural tools. Walking in the fields, you can see improved farm tools such as weeding machines running everywhere. According to statistics from the Northeast People's Government, more than 46,000 improved farm tools have appeared in the fertile fields of the Northeast during summer hoeing. Including the improved farm tools used in spring, more than 60,000 units have been promoted throughout the Northeast. In addition, 3,000 new-style animal-drawn farm tools purchased from the Soviet Union have been allocated to state-owned farms in various places to train technicians and cultivate cadres, laying the foundation for large-scale promotion next year. A portion of them (a complete set of 13 units, including plows, seeders, weeding machines, harvesters, and threshers) have been lent to 41 production teams. For thousands of years, peasants who had been crawling on the land and cultivating with their hands are now sitting on foreign plows, skillfully adjusting the machines, and freely and happily driving cattle and horses. This saves labor and produces results, and the peasants feel extremely excited. The Yang Xianting team in Minli Village, Keshan County, borrowed a set of new farm tools and not only reclaimed 30 *qing* of wasteland, but also managed to hoe and earth up five times (they are now striving for six hoeings and six earthings). Their team consists of 12 households, and they have an average of more than 8 *qing* of land per household, with an average harvest of 61 *shi* of grain per household. The yield per *qing*, including the newly reclaimed wasteland, is expected to be 44 percent higher than the normal yield (5.1 *shi*) this year, reaching more than 7.38 *shi* per *qing*. They are indescribably happy using the new farm tools, and whoever drives the new farm tools can't help but sing. They say, "Today we can finally separate ourselves from cattle and horses." Last year, Heilongjiang Province as a whole produced more than 14.6 million *shi* of grain, which was already an increase of 1.11 million *shi* compared to the previous year. This year, production will reach 17.8 million *shi*, an increase of another 3.2 million *shi* compared to last year.
　　As long as peasants harvest more grain, everything changes.
　　In the past, when peasants came to the city, they quietly slipped into the second-hand market to buy some old clothes and rags, and then quietly went home. After the autumn harvest last year, the situation changed dramatically! They first went to the state-owned stores, and then to the market. As long as the goods were good, they bought a lot. The cloth merchants in Keshan City sold out three times in one day. Because the state-owned stores mainly sold black and white cloth at the time, which could not meet the needs of the peasants, the peasants gave the state-owned stores the nickname "Black and White Company." This caused the state-owned stores to be overwhelmed and anxious. This is one aspect of what the peasants want to buy. The situation on the peasants' side, in terms of what they want to sell, is not much better. The state-owned grain company originally planned to purchase 42,400 tons in Keshan County. After exceeding the plan by 5,455 tons, it stopped purchasing at the end of May. As a result, grain prices immediately fell, with soybeans falling by 35 percent, corn falling by 45 percent, and wheat prices falling by half. However, the peasants' grain was still pouring into the market. To protect the interests of the peasants and avoid "low grain prices hurting farmers," purchases were resumed in mid-June. It was originally decided to purchase 10,750 tons in three months, but more than 2,000 tons had already been purchased in the first ten days.
　　How much surplus grain do the peasants have to sell? To what extent has the purchasing power of the peasants reached? The facts this year have exceeded any experienced estimate. The following is a survey of commodity grain and purchasing power in Democracy Village. This village is an ordinary village in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. It is called "ordinary" mainly because it is neither large nor small, with 169 households and 719 people. The village has 874 *qing* of land, 123 horses, 118 cattle, and 52 carts. Each person has an average of 1.2 *qing* of land, which is about the same as the county average of 1.13 *qing* per person. The peasants of Democracy Village, like the peasants in other villages that have implemented land reform, are becoming more and more aware and are becoming more and more active in production. But it is not the best, let alone a model village. Such an "ordinary" village has sold 213 tons of surplus grain (each ton is 1,000 kilograms, equivalent to 2,000 *jin*) from last autumn to the end of May this year. However, according to a survey in mid-June, the peasants in the village still have 7 or 8 tons of surplus grain that they are eager to sell, which means that they have a total of 280 tons of surplus grain to put on the market. From last autumn to now, Democracy Village has purchased 1.6 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) worth of consumer goods and means of production, and plans to buy another 370 million yuan worth of goods before autumn. In total, Democracy Village will purchase 2 billion yuan worth of goods in one year from the fourth quarter of last year to the end of the third quarter of this year – this is certainly not its total purchasing power, because the price of 280 tons of grain, plus the 850 million yuan of income from sideline occupations that has already been earned during the same period, is much greater than the 2 billion yuan it is purchasing goods for.
　　The rapid increase in the purchasing power of the peasants in Democracy Village is just one example of the rapid increase in the purchasing power of thousands of villages. The peasants in Keshan County need to sell 392,500 *shi* of surplus grain this year (equivalent to 88,312 tons); the value of bristle, horsetail, various hides, eggs, meat, and hemp and other light industrial raw materials that need to be sold is 50 billion yuan. The two items total 611 billion yuan. Such a huge number will all be used to buy back the consumer goods and means of production they need. In the cloth category alone, more than 54,000 bolts are needed, and there are significant improvements in the quality and specifications of the cloth. According to a survey of eight village cooperatives, two-fifths of the cloth to be bought in spring and summer will be green, white, and floral cloth, and three-fifths will be green, blue twill, and Haitian blue and Shilin cloth. In autumn and winter, two-thirds will be green and blue twill cloth, and one-third will be secondary white cloth (for linings) and floral cloth. At the same time, the county's peasants have an extremely large need for means of production, especially production tools. This year, the county needs to add 1,770 carts and 120,000 *jin* of plowshares. New and improved farm tools have just been tried out this year, and peasants are scrambling to buy them in large quantities. In summer hoeing alone, 1,400 improved weeding and earthing machines have been purchased. Now that the trial use has been successful, they will definitely be purchased in large quantities next year.
　　The peasants, liberated from the feudal exploitative land system, have begun to create their own prosperous life through hard work in just three short years. They have already begun to supply the cities with large amounts of grain and industrial raw materials and demand large amounts of industrial products. And these are opening up a broad path for the industrialization of the motherland.

　　土改三年后的北满农村
    本报特派记者  田流
    废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制，借以解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路。
                  ——中华人民共和国土地改革法总则
    最近，我访问了北满草原上的农村。从这村到那村，村村都有一个新鲜的名字：解放村、翻身村、民主村、富裕村……。一打听，原来这些新鲜的村名，都是实行土地改革时农民们自己起的。“如今村庄是自己的了，得给她起个咱自己的名字。”农民们说，在早先连村庄都是地主的：张家地主住在这村，这村就叫张家围子；李家地主又把他住的村庄叫做李家屯。农民们没有自己的土地，没有自己的房屋，连自己是那村人全说不上，不知道什么时候，就会被地主拿棍子赶出去。住在村里就像住店——连住店都不如，劳折了脊骨累弯了腰，一年到头也得不到温饱。解放了，翻身了，民主了，富裕起来了。农民们开始过着新生活，农村也便有了自己的新名字。
    “我们从没吃没穿的奴隶，变成了富裕的新社会的主人。”黑龙江省农业劳动英雄王治俭，今年“七一”给毛主席报告生产的信里这样说。他和村里其他九个人组织了一个换工生产小组，今年开了三十垧（注：每垧三千六百方步，等于十五市亩）荒地。现在他这一组每个人平均种着十垧地。今年春天人民政府贷给他们一全套苏联马拉新农具，生产力提高了。今年的庄稼要作到五铲（锄草）五趟（培土），“保证每个劳动力收粮五十五石”（按标准粮——高粱计算，每石四百五十斤）。他给毛主席的信上说：“争取六十石”。老王是黑龙江省讷河县国裕村人。早先，他村三百户人家倒有二百二十三户农民没有土地和房屋，十四家地主就把土地占去了一少半。一九四七年土地改革后，经过这两、三年来的积极劳动，村子里十家已有七家过上丰衣足食的中农生活了。这两年村里盖了二十三间新房子，买了九十五匹马、八十辆大车，开出一百二十多垧荒地。上年庄稼长的好，一垧地收了四石四斗八，比一九四五年，一垧地多打了一石二斗六。也难怪如今国裕村人人都穿得整整齐齐的。去年一年他们村就买了三百八十多匹布，大人孩子都算上，一人平均二丈八尺多。就像李德明吧，早先成年给地主扛大活（作长工），穷的啥也没有，一年到头“指身借粮”过日子；如今有了十垧多地，二马一车，还娶了个好媳妇，乐乐和和的日子过的挺美。
    人们都在这样说，土地改革后，“地气也变了”。谁说不是呢？就拿肇源县农业村王振堂住的四合屯说吧，一九四七年七十二垧地，收了一百七十九石粮，第二年还是那些地，却收了四百八十石；去年虽说遭了大旱灾，“年景差老鼻子啦！”但还是收的比上年多，打了五百一十石。给地主扛了三十二年长工的王振堂对这事摸的最清楚。他说原先是给地主干活，成年的拚死拚活，到头来还是挨冻受饿，种地也就懒了性啦，铲苗时好的铲掉坏苗留着，锄头砸坏了乐得歇一会，庄稼怎么会长得好？如今多收一棵自己多落一棵，谁全放满劲的往前干。
    这次我去访问该村是下午到的，因为走了一天路，很乏，早早地就睡下休息了。好像刚刚睡着，就被老王叫起来，说是吃早饭。看看表才四点钟，心里虽奇怪，因为是初次来北满农村，不知此地老百姓的生活习惯，只好起床。走在街上——冷清清不见一人，看看各家——也都静悄悄关门闭户。我当时想“人们都还睡着，老王却叫我吃早饭了。”几次想问，几次又蹩回去了。两天后才知道，原来老乡们“黑古冬冬”的就吃罢早饭，天蒙蒙亮就下地了，前天还是老王专为照顾我，才让我四点钟吃早饭的。这里的农民，不像华北一样，中午有“歇晌”的习惯。他们中午回家吃饭，吃罢饭马上又下地去，再回来已经是下午八点钟左右，天已漠漠黑了。我计算了一下此地农民的劳作时间，每天最少也有十六个钟头。为这事，我曾问过该村支部书记于长江同志，长此下去会不会影响健康？他说：“过去地主逼着比这还厉害呀！如今给自己干，累点也没啥，等光景再往上起一起再说吧，现在还不能松劲！”
    解放了的农民，第一次劳动在自己的土地上，生产热情是非常高涨的。他们贪早恋黑忘记疲劳的辛勤耕作着，创造着自己的幸福生活。他们精心的“侍弄”着自己的土地，深耕细作；他们努力开荒扩大着耕地面积。因此农民们的粮食也一年比一年收获的多起来。北安县西胜利村一九四五年全村有一百九十六垧地，收了五百二十三石粮，去年扩大耕地面积到四百零三垧，产粮一千七百四十石，耕地增加了一倍多，粮食却增加了两倍三。克山县前年产粮六十八万石，去年增到七十四万石，今年更将增到八十四万石。黑龙江全省土地改革那年，每垧地平均产粮一千五百斤，次年产一千八百斤，去年虽闹旱灾仍提高到二千斤。
    东北人民政府为进一步提高农业生产，今年用很多的钱推广新农具。走到田里，到处可以看见锄草机等改良农具在田野里驰行。据东北人民政府统计，夏锄中，已有四万六千余台改良农具出现在东北肥沃的田野里，连春季用的改良农具，全东北已经推广了六万余台。另外从苏联购买的三千台新式马拉农具，一部分拨给各地公营农场，以便训练技术培养干部，打下明年大量推广的基础；一部分成套的（一套十三台，洋犁、播种机、锄草机、收割机以至脱粒机通统都有），贷给了四十一个生产小组。数千年来爬在土地上用两手耕作的农民，现在已经坐在洋犁上，随心应手的调节着机器，自由愉快的驾驶着牛马。这样省工又出活，农民们感到极大的兴奋。克山县民利村杨显亭小组贷到一套新农具，不光开了三十垧荒地，还能作到五铲五趟（现在他们正为争取六铲六趟而努力）。他们这组共十二户人家，已经平均每户有了八垧多地，每户平均收获六十一石粮食。每垧地的产量连新开的荒地在内，今年要比常年产量（五石一斗）高百分之四十四，达到每垧产粮七石三斗八升多。他们使用新农具，心里说不出的高兴，不论谁一驾上新农具就不由的唱起来。他们说：“咱们今天才算和牛马分开了。”黑龙江全省，去年产粮一千四百六十余万石，已经是比前年增加了一百十一万石，而今年产量将达一千七百八十万石，又比去年增加了三百二十万石。
    农民只要粮食收的多，一切就都变样了。
    过去农民入城来，悄悄的溜到破烂市，买点破衣烂裳估衣啥的，就又悄悄的回家了。去年秋收后，情况可大变啦！他们先到国家商店，又到市场，只要货色好，一买就很多。克山城里的布商，一天卖过三次光。因为当时国家商店主要的是黑白二色布，不能满足农民的需要，农民们便给国家商店送了个绰号叫“黑白公司”。闹的国家商店手忙脚乱，干着急。这是农民们要买的一方面。农民要卖的一方面呢，情形比这并不更好些。国家粮食公司原来计划在克山县收买四万二千四百吨，超过计划五千四百五十五吨后，五月底停止收购，结果粮价立时下跌，大豆跌百分之三十五，苞米跌百分之四十五，麦价跌了一半，但农民的粮食仍源源上市。为保护农民的利益，以免“谷贱伤农”，六月中旬又开始收购。原决定三个月收购一万零七百五十吨，开始十天即已购入了二千余吨。
    究竟农民有多少余粮要卖呢？农民的购买力，究竟已达到了何种高度呢？今年的事实，超过了任何经验的估计。下面是民主村商品粮及购买力的调查。这个村庄是黑龙江省克山县一个普通的村庄。说它“普通”，主要是因为这村不大也不算小，有一百六十九户人家，七百一十九口人，不穷但也并不富。全村有八百七十四垧地，一百二十三匹马，一百一十八头牛和五十二辆车。每人平均一·二垧地，和全县每人平均一·一三垧差不多。民主村的农民和其他实行了土地改革村庄的农民一样，觉悟一天比一天高，生产越来越积极，但它并不是最好的，更不是模范村。这样一个“普通”的村庄，从去年秋后到今年五月末，已卖出余粮二百一十三吨（每吨一千公斤合二千市斤），但据六月中旬调查，该村农民还有七、八吨余粮急于出售，就是说它共有二百八十吨的余粮要投入市场。从去年秋后到现在，民主村已购买十六亿元（东北币，下同）的生活用品和生产资料，在秋前还要买三亿七千万元的物品。总计从去年秋收后第四季度到今年第三季度末一年内，民主村要购买二十亿元的物品——这当然并不是它的全部购买力，因为二百八十吨粮食的价格，和同时期已经收入的八亿五千万元的副业收入，总数远比它购买物品的二十亿元为多。
    民主村农民购买力的飞跃上升，只是千百个村庄购买力飞跃上升的例子之一。克山县农民今年需要出售的余粮达三十九万二千五百石（合八万八千三百一十二吨）；需要出售的猪鬃、马尾、各种皮张、鸡蛋、肉类以及麻等轻工业原料价值五百亿元。两项共合六千一百一十亿元。这样巨大的数字，都要买回他们所需要的生活用品和生产资料。仅布匹一项就需要五万四千余匹，而且对布匹的质量、规格要求都有显著的提高。据八个村合作社的调查，春夏季要买五分之二的青、白和花布，五分之三的青、蓝斜纹布和海昌蓝、士林布。秋冬季三分之二要青、蓝斜纹布，三分之一的次白布（作里子）和花布。同时该县农民对于生产资料，特别是生产工具的需要数量是极大的。今年全县要添一千七百七十辆大车，十二万斤犁铧。新式农具和改良农具今年刚试用，农民就大量争购，仅夏锄用的改良锄草培土机，就购买了一千四百台，现在试用即已成功，明年必然大量购买。
    从封建剥削的土地制度下解放了的农民，在短短的三年内，已经用辛勤劳动开始创造出自己的富裕生活，已经开始对城市供应着大量的粮食和工业原料和要求着大量的工业品。而这些，正开辟着祖国工业化的宽广的道路。
