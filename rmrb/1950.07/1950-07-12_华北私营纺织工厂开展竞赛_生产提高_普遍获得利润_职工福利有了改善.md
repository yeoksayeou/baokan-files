	Competition Launched in North China's Private Textile Factories
	Production Increases, Profits Universally Gained, and Employee Benefits Improved
	[This Newspaper Reports] With the support of the government and relatively normal labor-capital relations, private textile factories in North China have launched a production competition campaign. Production in all factories has generally increased, and all have gained certain profits; employee welfare has also begun to improve.
	The number of private textile factories in North China is small. There are only five factories with larger scales. All factories have a total of 110,824 spindles and 1,260 looms. To support the production of these factories, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company signed supply and sales contracts with them, guaranteeing the supply of all the cotton needed by the factories and underwriting all the finished products produced by the factories, thus solving the difficulties of raw materials, capital, and market for the factories. At the same time, all factories have established labor-capital consultation meetings to resolve all problems between labor and capital in a manner of equal consultation, so that labor-capital relations tend to be normal. On the premise of developing production, Beiyang and Hengyuan factories, under the organization and leadership of the trade union, launched a red banner competition in April. Daxiang Yarn Factory launched a "Production Month" campaign in March, and also launched a production competition in Red May. Tianjin Dasheng Yarn Factory also launched a red banner competition in June. In the competition, the output of each factory generally increased, and production efficiency was significantly improved. For example, in Hengyuan in May, each spindle produced an average of 0.832 pounds of 20-count yarn, an increase of 3.63% compared to April, and an increase of 8.6% compared to the average output in January, February, and March; the average output of each loom was 72.84 yards, an increase of 3.85% compared to April, and an increase of over 14% compared to the average output in January, February, and March. The average yarn production per spindle in Beiyang in March was 0.8018 pounds, which increased to 0.865 pounds in April, and further increased to 0.904 pounds in May, breaking the factory's historical production record. During the "Production Month" campaign in March, the output per spindle in Daxiang Yarn Factory increased to 1.043 pounds, 1.048 pounds per spindle in April, and continued to increase to 1.097 pounds in May.
	Due to the development of production, all factories have generally made profits. For example, in the Red Banner competition in Hengyuan in May, the net profit was more than 140 million yuan in more than 20 days; the value of excess production in Beiyang in May was about 500 million yuan, and Daxiang Yarn Factory made a net profit of more than 380 million yuan in March, and more than 400 million yuan in April. Therefore, the confidence of the capitalists in management has been significantly improved. Hengyuan installed 42 new looms in March. Beiyang purchased 3,000 new spindles and other machines in May. Dasheng also plans to purchase two fine yarn machines (i.e., 800 spindles). Daxiang Yarn Factory has 300 looms in operation throughout the factory, and 36 new ones were opened in June, and 90 more are being renovated. The capitalists also plan to move 10,000 spindles from Hankou to Shijiazhuang.
	Under the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, all factories are also actively improving employee welfare facilities. For example, Hengyuan has decided to repair the weaving factory building and plans to install air-conditioning equipment. 15% of the total surplus, totaling more than 52 million yuan, has been extracted and awarded to 722 advanced producers. Beiyang, Dasheng, Daxiang and other factories generally give material rewards to advanced producers.

　　华北私营纺织工厂开展竞赛
    生产提高  普遍获得利润·职工福利有了改善
    【本报讯】华北各私营纺织工厂在政府扶持与劳资关系比较正常的条件下，开展了生产竞赛运动。各厂生产普遍提高，都获得了一定的利润；职工福利事业也开始有了改善。
    华北私营纺织工厂为数不多。规模较大的不过五家。所有工厂中共有十一万零八百二十四枚锭子，一千二百六十台布机。花纱布公司为扶助各厂生产，与各厂订立了供销合同，保证供给各厂所需全部棉花，包销各厂所产全部成品，因而解决了各厂原料、资金、市场等方面的困难。同时，各厂都成立了劳资协商会议，以平等协商的方式，解决劳资间所发生的一切问题，使劳资关系趋于正常。在发展生产的前提下，北洋、恒源两厂在工会的组织领导下，自四月份起展开了红旗竞赛。大兴纱厂在三月间即发动了“生产月”运动，红五月也开展了生产竞赛。天津达生纱厂也在六月份开展了红旗竞赛。在竞赛中，各厂产量普遍增加，生产效率显著提高。如恒源五月份每个纱锭以二十支纱计，平均产量已达○点八三二磅，比四月份提高百分之三点六三，比一、二、三月份平均产量提高了百分之八点六；每台布机平均产量为七十二点八四码，较四月份提高了百分之三点八五，比一、二、三月份平均产量提高了百分之十四强。北洋三月份每锭平均产纱○点八○一八磅，四月份提高到○点八六五磅，五月份又提高到○点九○四磅，打破该厂历来的生产纪录。大兴纱厂三月份“生产月”运动中，每锭产量提高到一点○四三磅，四月份每锭产一点○四八磅，五月份继续提高到一点○九七磅。
    各厂由于生产发展，普遍获得盈余。如恒源在五月红旗竞赛中，二十多天即得纯利一亿四千余万元；北洋五月份超额生产的价值约五亿元，大兴纱厂在三月份获纯利三亿八千多万元，四月份又赚四亿多。因此资方经营信心已显著提高。恒源在三月份就新装了四十二台织布机。北洋在五月间新购了三千锭子及其他机器。达生也计划添购细纱机两部（即八百锭）。大兴纱厂全厂已开布机三百台，六月份又新开三十六台，还有九十台正在装修中，资方并拟将汉口的一万锭子搬到石家庄。
    在劳资两利的政策下，各厂也正积极改善职工福利设施。如恒源已决定修理布厂厂房，并拟按装冷气设备。从总盈余中已抽出百分之十五计五千二百余万元，奖给七百二十二名生产先进。北洋、达生、大兴等厂都普遍给先进生产者以物质奖励。
