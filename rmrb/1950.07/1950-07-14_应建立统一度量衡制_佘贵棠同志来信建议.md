　　Should Establish a Unified System of Weights and Measures
    Comrade She Guitang's letter suggests

    Editor:
    I earnestly hope that you will write an editorial calling everyone's attention to the system of weights and measures. Otherwise, it will hinder the transmission of policies and the understanding of situations in various regions.
    Some correspondents, when citing a series of numbers, do not indicate whether the units are in the Chinese system (市制) or the metric system (公制); some simultaneously use the Chinese, metric, and Anglo-American units. The names of the units are not uniform. One report says that the output of timber is so many "cubic meters (立方米)," but the same newspaper states that the railway bridge was built for so many "meters (公尺)." A clear example is Vice Premier Chen Yun's report on the financial and grain situation, in which the mu and jin numbers are probably "Chinese mu (市亩)" and "Chinese jin (市斤)," and the ton numbers are probably "metric tons (公吨)," but none of these are specified. The mu and jin are generally not a problem, but the ton can be either "metric ton (公吨)" or "English ton (英吨)." Using only the word "ton," people in Shanghai generally understand it to mean "English ton (英吨)."
    Inaccurate units make learning inconvenient, because if you don't know for sure what the units are, you can't associate them with actual affairs. Units are closely related to taxation. Especially relevant is the trade policy to promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, such as the purchase of cotton and grain, and the sale of cotton yarn and kerosene. The exploitation suffered by farmers is often two-sided. Merchants' profits within a certain range are recognized by the government and can be controlled by stipulated prices. However, exploitation in measurement is not easy to detect, and staff members need to have a clear understanding of the system of weights and measures.
    Out of my love for my newspaper, I make the above suggestions.
                     She Guitang, China Travel Service, 420 Sichuan Middle Road, Shanghai

### 应建立统一度量衡制  佘贵棠同志来信建议

　　应建立统一度量衡制
    佘贵棠同志来信建议编辑同志：
    我恳切地希望你们做出一篇社论，号召大家注意度量衡制。要不然，对于政策的传达和各地情况的了解是有碍的。
    有些通讯员在举出一列数字时，不标明单位是市制或公制，有些同时应用市制、公制、和英美制单位。单位的名称不一律，一个报告说木材的产量是若干“立方米”，但在同一张报纸上载明铁路的桥梁修筑了若干“公尺”。一个显明的例子是陈云副总理关于财政状况和粮食状况的报告，那里面举出的亩数和斤数大概是“市亩”和“市斤”，吨数大概是“公吨”，然而都没有注明。亩数和斤数大致没有问题，吨数却有“公吨”和“英吨”的不同。只用一个“吨”字，上海人一般所了解的是“英吨”。
    单位不准确使学习的人感觉不便，因为假定不确实知道了什么单位，就不能和实际的事务发生联想。单位和税收的关系很是密切。尤其有关系的是促进城乡互助的贸易政策，例如棉花和粮食的收购，棉纱和煤油的出售，农民所受的剥削往往是两方面的。商人一定程度以内的利润为政府所认可，而且可以用规定的价格来控制。但量制上的剥削是不容易被觉察的，工作人员更有掌握明确度量衡制观点的必要。
    我出于对自己新闻纸的热爱，提出以上的建议。
