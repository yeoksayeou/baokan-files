　　Close Military-Civilian Relations Lay the Foundation for Rectification
    Shanghai Garrison Troops Inspect Discipline
    Solicit Public Opinion Through Various Circles' Symposiums and Earn Public Praise Through Earnest Self-Criticism
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th] The Shanghai garrison troops of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army conducted a major discipline inspection throughout the army in June, strengthening the troops' policy viewpoints and mass discipline, further strengthening military-civilian relations, and laying a good foundation for the upcoming rectification movement.

    In order to deeply understand the policy and discipline of the troops, the Political Department of the garrison troops invited representatives from all walks of life in the resident community to hold a symposium in early June to solicit opinions. Workers, farmers, students, women, people's police, industrialists and businessmen, and religious professionals who attended the meeting unanimously praised the garrison troops for their strict discipline, hard life, active work, and love for the people since entering Shanghai. At the same time, they also put forward well-intentioned criticisms of some violations of discipline by individual units or individuals, such as infringing on the interests of the masses in production, damaging public places, not paying attention to hygiene, having a blunt attitude in dealing with people, and some one-sided viewpoints on the interests of the masses. The person in charge of the garrison troops conducted self-criticism at the symposium and gave sincere explanations to some opinions based on misunderstandings or rumors. This method of contacting the masses, improving work, and the spirit of self-criticism received a good response from people of all walks of life.

    After the symposium, the garrison troops collected the opinions of the masses from all walks of life, conducted careful research, compiled them into volumes, and notified all subordinate units. Combined with the ideological mobilization of the major discipline inspection, they carried out in-depth education in the troops. Subsequently, leading cadres at all levels began to carry out top-down discipline inspections and conducted bottom-up summaries. The CCP committees at all levels sent working groups to the company level to provide concrete leadership, ensuring the smooth progress of the inspection work. After this discipline inspection, the persons in charge at all levels of the garrison troops unanimously realized that although the troops had generally performed well in implementing policies and discipline since entering Shanghai, a few leading personnel had developed complacency and paralysis as a result, failing to pay sufficient attention to urging and inspection and strict education, resulting in some adverse phenomena in violation of discipline. After the inspection, commanders and fighters at all levels strengthened their awareness of policies and discipline and raised their vigilance. Some commanders and fighters who had previously harbored the idea of ​​being meritorious officials, were arrogant and complacent, or could not withstand the test after entering the city and thus developed some bad tendencies, made profound reviews of some of their violations of discipline. After the inspection, many units formulated covenants, and commanders and fighters all wrote personal guarantees, stating that in future work, they would resolutely implement policies and discipline and thoroughly overcome various bad tendencies.

    The Political Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army issued a circular to commend the garrison troops for their attention to policies and discipline and for using the method of symposiums in various circles to inspect the implementation of policies and discipline. It called on the troops stationed in cities to learn from the garrison troops, frequently listen to the opinions of the masses, and promptly inspect the troops' implementation of policies and discipline to educate the troops, in order to further consolidate military-civilian relations and maintain the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army.

　　密切军民关系为整风打下基础
    上海警备部队检查纪律
    运用各界座谈会听取人民的意见  认真进行自我批评获得各界赞许
    【新华社上海二十日电】人民解放军第三野战军驻在上海的警备部队曾于六月间在全军进行了纪律大检查，加强了部队的政策观点和群众纪律，进一步密切了军民的关系，并为即将到来的整风运动奠定了良好的基础。
    该部政治部为深入了解部队执行政策纪律状况，六月上旬曾邀请驻地各界居民代表举行座谈会征求意见。到会的工人、农民、学生、妇女、人民警察、工商业者及宗教职业者都一致赞扬该部进驻上海以来所表现的纪律严明、生活艰苦、积极工作、热爱人民的优秀品质，同时对该部个别单位或个人的某些违反纪律现象，如在生产中侵犯群众利益、损坏公共场所、不讲究卫生、待人接物态度生硬以及某些片面的群众利益观点等，亦提出了善意的批评。该部负责人在座谈会上即进行了自我批评，并对某些出于误会或谣传的意见，作了恳切的解释。这一联系群众、改进工作的方式与自我批评的精神，获得了各阶层市民良好的反映。
    该部在座谈会后，即搜集各界群众的意见，进行了仔细的研究，并分别编印成册，通报所属各部，结合纪律大检查的思想动员，在部队中进行深入的教育。接着，各级领导干部开始展开由上而下的纪律大检查，并由下而上地进行了总结。各部中共党委在纪律检查中，派出工作组深入连队，具体领导，保证了检查工作的顺利进行。该部各级负责人经过此次纪律检查后，一致认识到：虽然部队自进驻上海市区以来，在执行政策纪律上总的方面是好的，但少数领导人员曾因而产生了自满麻痹现象，未能充分注意进行督促检查、严格教育，以致产生了某些违反纪律的不良现象。各部指战员在检查后，加强了政策纪律的观念，提高了警惕。某些过去存在着功臣自居、骄傲自大思想，或进入城市后经不起考验，因而滋长着某些不良倾向的指战员，对自己某些违反纪律的现象都作了深刻的检讨。检查后，很多单位都订出公约，指战员们都订了个人的保证书，表示在以后工作中，决心严格执行政策纪律，彻底克服各种不良倾向。
    华东军区和第三野战军政治部对该部重视政策纪律，并运用各界座谈会的方式以检查政策纪律执行情形的方法，特发出通报予以表扬，号召各驻城市的部队向该部学习，经常倾听群众意见，及时检查部队执行政策纪律的情况来教育部队，以进一步巩固军民关系，保持人民解放军的优良传统。
