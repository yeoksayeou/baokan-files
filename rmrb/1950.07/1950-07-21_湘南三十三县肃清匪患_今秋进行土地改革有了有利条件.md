Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 18th: The banditry in 33 counties including Lingling, Chenzhou, Hengyang, and Shaoyang in southern Hunan Province has been basically eliminated, which has prepared favorable conditions for land reform after this autumn. The whole territory of Hunan is full of continuous mountains and valleys. This area and western Hunan have always been areas where bandits are active. Before and after liberation, Chiang Kai-shek bandits left behind a large number of bandit troops and secret agents, colluding with evil landlords and habitual bandits, attempting to continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. According to statistics last year, there were as many as 70,000 bandits in the whole territory, and they controlled four county towns. After the establishment of the Southern Hunan Bandit Suppression Command of the People's Liberation Army in December last year, it first won the surrender of nearly 10,000 men from the pseudo "New Eighth Army." Then, it concentrated its forces and adopted the tactics of long-distance raids, strict encirclement, and continuous pursuit, annihilating more than 20,000 bandits of the "Enemy Rear Armed Guerrilla Force," and captured alive Wang Chunhui, director of the Bandit Transportation Police Headquarters Southeast Office, a major secret agent of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau, and other important bandit leaders such as Chen Guangzhong. Within half a month, bandits with more than 500 people were eliminated.

Under the shock of our army's prestige, the remaining bandits changed their mode of operation, fragmented their forces, relied on gang feudal forces, used the spring famine in some areas, spread rumors, incited the masses to resist grain, and occasionally assassinated our cadres. Our army immediately adopted the principle of "the enemy changes, we change", and adopted the policy of focusing on mobilizing the masses and launching political offensives, supplemented by military suppression, to carry out suppression. In areas where there are no large groups of bandits, a part of the main force combined with county and district armed forces to carry out mass work and establish a harmonious relationship between the army and the people. Commanders and fighters launched propaganda work to enlighten the masses and assisted the local area in carrying out the rent reduction movement. Therefore, the peasants' awareness has gradually increased, eliminating the fear of bandits, and they have organized themselves under the leadership of the peasants' association to prevent bandits and secret agents. The Yao compatriots on the border between Hunan and Guangdong also voluntarily led the army to search the mountains, and they also erected rolling logs and rocks on mountain passes, making it impossible for the remaining bandits to hide.

Under the vigorous political offensive launched by the stationed troops and governments at all levels, the remaining bandits surrendered and started anew. Since April, more than 1,800 remaining bandits in Lingling District have surrendered and started anew. A certain regiment annihilated 655 bandits in one month, of which 404 surrendered. Our army resolutely carried out suppression of the die-hard remnants of bandits. The mountain search troops braved the continuous rain in the rarely populated Xuefeng Mountains, climbed mountains and ridges, quenched their thirst with mountain water, filled their stomachs with bamboo shoots, and continued without sleep for several days and nights, and finally wiped out the remaining bandits one by one.

From December last year to May this year, more than 68,000 bandits were annihilated. At present, except for small groups of remaining bandits fleeing in the area bordering western Hunan and northern Guangxi, and a few scattered bandits lurking in the deep mountains of the interior, there are no traces of bandits in the vast area of southern Hunan. Mass work has been fully launched.

　　湘南三十三县肃清匪患
    今秋进行土地改革有了有利条件
    【新华社汉口十八日电】湖南省南部零陵、郴州、衡阳、邵阳等三十三县匪患已基本肃清，为今年秋后进行土地改革准备了有利的条件。湖南全境丛山峻岭，该地与湘西均向为土匪活动地区。解放前后，蒋匪曾遗留大量匪军、特务，勾结恶霸地主、惯匪，企图继续从事反革命活动。据去年统计，全境土匪竟达七万人，并控制县城四座。去年十二月人民解放军湘南剿匪指挥部成立后，首先争取了伪“新八军”近万人的投诚。继而集中力量，采取远道奔袭、严密包围、不停追击的战术，歼灭匪“敌后武装游击队”二万余人，并活捉匪交通警察总队东南办事处主任、伪国防部保密局大特务王春晖及陈光中等重要匪首。在半个月内，即将五百人以上的股匪肃清。
    残匪在我军声威震慑下，改变活动方式，化整为零，依托帮会封建势力，利用局部地区的春荒，散布谣言，进行煽动群众抗粮的活动，并不时暗杀我干部。我军当即根据匪变我变的原则，采取以发动群众和展开政治攻势为主、军事进剿为辅的方针，进行清剿。在已无大股土匪的地区，以主力一部结合县、区武装进行群众工作，建立起融洽的军民关系。指战员们展开宣传工作，启发群众觉悟，并协助地方展开减租运动。因此，农民觉悟日渐提高，消除了怕匪心理，纷纷在农会领导下组织起来防匪防特。湘粤边界的徭胞亦自动为军队带路搜山，他们并在山道隘口架设滚木擂石，使残匪无法藏身。
    在驻剿部队和各级政府大力展开政治攻势下，残匪纷纷投诚自新。零陵分区四月来即有一千八百余名残匪投诚自新。某团一个月歼匪六百五十五人，其中投降者即达四百零四人。对怙恶不悛的残匪，我军即进行坚决的清剿。搜山部队在罕有人迹的雪峰山中，冒着霪雨，爬山越岭，以山水解渴，以竹笋充饥，连续数日夜不眠不息，卒将残匪一一歼灭。
    自去年十二月到今年五月，歼匪达六万八千余人。现湘南全境除与湘西、桂北毗连处尚有小股残匪流窜，内地深山中尚有少数散匪潜伏外，广大地区已无匪踪。群众工作已全面展开。
