　　Forty-one Returned Students Assigned Work After Studying at Revolutionary University
　　Recently, forty-one students from the Political Research Class of the North China People's Revolutionary University were ordered to be transferred to work in various regions. These students were all returned students from countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and Switzerland, who came back around the time of the founding of the Central People's Government. For more than half a year, they have actively studied revolutionary theory and worked hard to transform their thinking. When they were transferred to work, they unanimously expressed their obedience to the organization's assignment, not caring about the nature of the work, position, treatment, or region. On the eve of their departure from the school, each class held farewell parties.

    归国留学生四十一名  在革大学习后分配工作
    华北人民革命大学政治研究班最近有四十一名学员奉命调赴各地工作。这些学员都是在中央人民政府成立前后，由美、英、法、瑞等国回来的留学生。半年多来，他们积极学习革命理论，努力改造思想。调赴工作时，他们一致表示服从组织分配，不计较工作性质、地位、待遇和地区。离校前夕，各班都举行了欢送会。
