　　Department Store Adjusts Prices and Business Scope
    Zhengzhou's Public-Private Relations Gradually Harmonize
    [Report from our Zhengzhou correspondent] The Zhengzhou City Company of the China Department Store has been gradually adjusting its public-private relations in June, which has made public-private relations tend to harmonize, and market transactions have also turned active. In order to concentrate its efforts to connect urban and rural internal and external relations, and focus on strengthening wholesale business, the company had its original six stores changed from all operating retail and wholesale to retaining five stores to maintain retail business and wholesale, with one store focusing on wholesale business. The business hours of the wholesale and retail departments have also been appropriately adjusted to facilitate customers. In the past, each store sold all kinds of goods. Now, in order to facilitate wholesale business, it has been changed to: the first store mainly deals in yarn, cotton fabrics, and daily necessities; the third store mainly deals in paper and pigments; and the sixth store mainly deals in cement, equipment, white sugar, and groceries. After the adjustment, the company's wholesale volume in June accounted for about 70% to 80% of the total turnover; the retail part accounted for only about 20% to 30%. In May, the wholesale volume accounted for only slightly more than 50%.
    In terms of listed prices, the difference between retail and wholesale prices has been adjusted as necessary and reasonably based on the actual situation of the Zhengzhou market and the production, transportation, and sales aspects, and retail prices have been appropriately and gradually increased so that private merchants can obtain reasonable profits. At present, the general retail price has been raised to about 8% higher than the wholesale price (the difference indicated by the Henan Provincial People's Government is 2% to 12%).
    In terms of supporting the production of private factories, the company signed a contract with Zhengzhou Jiming Cotton Weaving Factory on June 10, ordering 50 pieces of colored striped cloth, and paid the factory 6.35 million yuan. It ordered 60 boxes of Fenghuangtai large-pack cigarettes (48 cigarettes per pack) from Fuhua Tobacco Factory, and paid 59.4 million yuan. After the two contracts were signed, the manufacturers were very satisfied. In addition, the company also acquired other industrial products with 300 to 500 million yuan in cash to change the sluggish market situation and promote the rationalization of market prices.
    In addition, in order to unite private merchants to overcome temporary difficulties together, the company has held many meetings to discuss consignment sales methods. On June 20, it convened managers of six private department stores and managers of other industries to discuss and carefully negotiate a mutual agreement and signed a consignment sales contract. According to statistics, the initial sales plan of each consignment sales agent is about 200 million yuan per month. After the establishment of various consignment sales relationships, private firms have praised the People's Government for its considerate care, and expressed that they are willing to engage in legitimate business under the leadership of state-owned enterprises forever in the future.

　　百货公司调整价格及经营范围
    郑州公私关系逐渐融洽
    【本报郑州讯】中国百货公司郑州市公司六月份逐步调整公私关系，已使公私关系趋于融洽，市场交易也转向活跃。该公司为集中力量沟通城乡内外关系，重点加强批发业务，曾将原有六个门市部由过去全部经营零售兼带批发改为除留五个门市部仍旧保持零售业务兼带批发外，以一个门市部重点经营批发业务。且将批发部门与零售部门营业时间作了适当调整，以便利顾客。过去各门市部经售货物品种应有尽有，现为便利批发业务，已改为：第一门市部主要经营纱布、棉织品、日用品，第三门市部主要经营纸张颜料，第六门市部主要经营水泥、器材、红白糖、杂货。经调整后，该公司六月份批发额约占营业总额的百分之七十至八十左右；零售部分仅占百分之二十至三十左右。而五月份批发额只占百分之五十强。
    在牌价方面，零售与批发的差额，曾根据郑州市场与产、运、销三方面的实际情况作了必要而合理的调整，并适当地逐步提高了零售价格，使私商可以获得合理利润。现零售价一般的已提至高于批发价的百分之八左右（河南省人民政府指示之差额为百分之二至百分之十二）。
    在扶植私营厂商生产方面，该公司曾于六月十日与郑州市济民棉织工厂订立合同，定织色条布五十匹，共付该厂货款六百三十五万元。向福华烟厂定购凤凰台大包烟（四十八支装）六十箱，共付货款五千九百四十万元。两合同订立后，厂商均甚满意。此外，该公司还以三亿至五亿现款收购其他工业品，以改变市场滞销局面，并促使市价牌价趋向合理。
    又该公司为了团结私商共同克服暂时困难，曾多次集会研讨代销办法，六月二十日又召集六个私营百货商店经理及其他行业经理集议慎重商讨双方协议，签订了代销合同。据统计：各代销商初步销售计划每月销货金额约在两亿元以上。各代销关系建立后，私营行号纷纷称颂人民政府照顾周到，表示今后愿永远在国营企业领导下，从事正当经营。（侯义方、张言民）
