　　On the Organizational Leadership of Tianjin's Workers' Spare-Time Education
　　By our reporter Jin Feng

　　The large-scale development of Tianjin's workers' spare-time education began in March of this year. By June, 173 workers' spare-time schools had been established, enrolling 51,385 worker-students, exceeding the annual target of 50,000 worker enrollments.

　　From "Trade Union Leadership" to "Government Leadership, Relying on Trade Unions"

　　Before September of last year—the early days of liberation—the leadership of worker education in Tianjin was multi-headed and dispersed. It was generally led by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, with the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, district committees, the Municipal Education Bureau's Social Education Section, district cultural and educational divisions, and individual agencies and schools also participating in leading worker's spare-time education.

　　After September, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, based on the National Trade Union Work Conference's instructions on worker education, clearly recognized that the direction and steps of worker education should be to systematically and organizedly develop universal spare-time cultural education. However, issues related to the school system, curriculum, teaching materials, and teachers for worker's spare-time education had to be resolved with the assistance of the government's education departments. At the same time, under the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, it was impossible to fully utilize the strength of schools and cultural and educational agencies at all levels to universally carry out worker's spare-time education. Therefore, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions requested the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau to take charge of leading worker's spare-time education. At that time, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau did not clearly understand the position of worker education in the overall education work, believing that worker education should primarily be the work of the trade union, and did not immediately accept the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' opinion. It was not until after the National Education Work Conference was held in December that the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau clearly recognized that government education departments must assume responsibility for leading worker's spare-time education. The Tianjin Municipal Government then decided to establish a Worker-Peasant Education Section within the Education Bureau as the agency in charge of all worker's spare-time schools in the city. This began to realize the organizational principle of "government leadership, relying on trade unions."

　　The Municipal Education Bureau's Worker-Peasant Education Section carried out specific preparatory work for launching worker's spare-time education in February of this year: training over 100 full-time cadres for worker's spare-time schools, drafting a preliminary school system and organizational methods, and compiling some teaching materials. The Municipal Education Bureau also called on all middle and primary schools and cultural centers in the city to be responsible for running worker's spare-time schools, stipulating that the performance of each school and center in running worker's spare-time schools would be the focus of work inspection. Currently, 156 of the city's 173 worker's spare-time schools are located in middle and primary schools; most of the middle and primary school principals also serve as principals of the spare-time schools. The vast majority of the 2,040 spare-time school teachers are concurrently employed by middle and primary schools.

　　Factory Schools and District Schools

　　Tianjin's worker's spare-time schools are divided into three types: factory schools, mainly run by factories, targeting industrial workers concentrated in factories; district schools, divided into those run in middle schools and those run in primary schools, targeting industrial workers and general industry workers living in scattered areas; and cadre schools, established in middle schools. Among the 173 worker's spare-time schools, there are 46 factory schools, 120 district schools, and 7 cadre schools. The Worker-Peasant Education Section leads all district schools run by primary schools through the district cultural and educational divisions, leads factory schools through the industrial trade unions, and directly leads all district schools and cadre schools run by middle schools.

　　The characteristic of district schools is the complexity of the target group. For example, the more than 300 students of the 14th Worker's Spare-Time School include 22 industries and 158 units; as such, the mobility of students is particularly high, with an average attendance rate of only about 70%. Therefore, some district schools have established organizations such as student unions, unit representative meetings, and diligent study mutual aid groups, which have played a certain role in guaranteeing and consolidating learning.

　　Another problem with district schools is that the concurrently employed middle and primary school teachers do not have enough time, which seriously affects their health and teaching effectiveness. However, some schools, such as the principal of the 7th Primary School in the 2nd District, concurrently serves as the principal of the worker's spare-time school, and two teaching directors are set up under the principal to be responsible for the day and night schools respectively. The number of part-time teachers in the night school has been reduced, and full-time teachers have been hired for the night school with the remuneration. In this way, teachers are divided into two groups: one group focuses on teaching day school, and subject teachers can also work part-time in night school; the other group focuses on teaching night school and can also work part-time as day school subject teachers. In this way, there is no need to increase funding, and the leadership of the worker's spare-time school has been strengthened.

　　The problem with factory schools is mainly the unclear leadership relationship among the Education Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the industrial trade unions, the on-site trade unions, and the administration regarding the spare-time schools. These relationships are even more complex in state-owned factories. The textile factories under China Textile Corporation have more than 30,000 workers, accounting for about one-quarter of the city's industrial workers, but less than 4,000 people participate in spare-time school learning. One of the reasons is the uncertain leadership relationship. In some factories, the on-site trade union and the administration have taken on the responsibility of leadership, and the worker's spare-time school is run better; otherwise, the worker's spare-time school is a free-for-all.

　　Another problem with factory schools is that some factory administrations only care about current production, and their understanding of long-term plans to improve production and improve production through learning is insufficient. They do not pay enough attention to worker's spare-time schools and often cannot guarantee study time due to overtime work and meetings. For example, the Hengda Tobacco Factory often suspends spare-time school classes due to rush overtime, and only four days of classes were held in the first seventeen days of May; on the other hand, some factories, such as the Tianjin Steel Plant, Bicycle Factory, and China Textile No. 5 Factory, have established school affairs committees including the factory director, military representative, trade union director, Party branch secretary, Youth League branch secretary, and spare-time school principal, which uniformly allocate workers' spare time and ensure that study time is not used for meetings or overtime work, which makes the spare-time school stable.

　　Government Leadership Must Rely on Trade Unions

　　"Government leadership, relying on trade unions" is the basic principle for running worker's spare-time schools well. The Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Education Section and the Education Bureau's Worker-Peasant Education Section only have "cooperation" and no "division of labor": it uses its strength together with the Education Bureau in the administrative management of worker's spare-time schools, without giving more consideration to the special responsibilities and roles of the trade union in worker education, and without assuming the responsibility of leading the industrial trade unions, industry trade unions, and on-site trade unions to promote and guarantee learning, which has caused difficulties in the consolidation and development of district schools and factory schools. Individual industrial trade unions and industry trade unions, such as the Municipal Works Union, originally ran worker's spare-time schools, but later, when they saw that the government had taken on the responsibility of leading worker education, they completely shirked their responsibility.

　　At the same time, an organizational structure like the Worker-Peasant Education Section cannot unite, organize, and use the strength of all parties and levels, so it is not easy to promptly solve major problems such as the contradiction between production and learning, guaranteeing unified study time, and unified planning and expenditure of funds.

　　Therefore, to further improve Tianjin's worker's spare-time education, it is still necessary to expand the establishment of worker's spare-time education committees at all levels of the city, districts, and factories, including all relevant agencies and organizations, and to further grasp the direction of worker's spare-time education and uniformly decide on issues such as the school system, curriculum, teachers, and funding; the Municipal Education Bureau's Worker-Peasant Education Section and the trade union should achieve a very appropriate division of labor.

　　天津市职工业余教育工作的组织领导问题
    本报记者  金凤 
    天津市职工业余教育的大量开展，是从今年三月开始的。到六月份，已经成立工人业余学校一百七十三处，吸收职工学员五万一千三百八十五人，超额完成了全年预定吸收五万工人入学的计划。
            从“工会领导”到“政府领导，依靠工会”
    在去年九月以前——解放初期，天津市的工人教育的领导是多头而分散的，大抵是以市总工会为主，市委宣传部、区委、市教育局社教科、区文教股以及个别的机关、学校等也都参加领导职工业余教育工作。
    九月以后，天津市总工会根据全国工会工作会议关于工人教育的指示，明确认识了工人教育的方针和步骤，应该是有计划地、有组织地普遍开展业余文化教育。但有关工人业余教育的学制、课程、教材、师资等问题，必须政府的教育部门来协助解决；同时在市总工会的领导下，也不能充分使用各级学校和文教机关的力量，来普遍开展工人业余教育。因此，天津市总工会就要求天津市教育局负责领导工人业余教育。当时天津市教育局对于工人教育在全盘教育工作中的地位认识不够明确，以为工人教育应该主要是工会的工作，对于天津市总工会的意见，并没有立即接受。直至十二月全国教育工作会议召开以后，天津市教育局才明确认识了政府教育部门必须负起领导工人业余教育的责任。天津市府乃决定在教育局内增设工农教育科，作为主管全市工人业余学校的机构。开始实现“政府领导，依靠工会”的组织原则。
    市教育局工农教育科在今年二月间进行了开展工人业余教育的具体准备工作：训练了一百多个工人业余学校的专职干部，草拟了初步的学制和组织办法，编选了一部分教材。市教育局并号召全市中、小学和文化馆，应负责举办工人业余学校，规定以各校、馆办理工人业余学校的成绩作为工作检查的重点。现在全市一百七十三个工人业余学校中，有一百五十六个是设立在中学和小学内；中、小学的校长，大都兼任了业余学校的校长。二千零四十个业余学校的教员中，绝大多数都是由中、小学的教职员兼职的。
            厂校和区校
    天津市工人业余学校一共分为三种：厂校，以工厂为主举办的，对象是集中在工厂的产业工人；区校，又分在中学举办的和小学举办的，对象是分散居住的产业工人和一般行业工人；干部学校，设立在中学内。在一百七十三个工人业余学校中，厂校四十六处，区校一百二十处，干部学校七处。工农教育科通过各区文教股领导所有小学举办的区校，通过各产业工会领导厂校，直接领导所有中学举办的区校和干部学校。
    区校的特点是对象复杂，如第十四工人业余学校的三百多名学员，包括了二十二种行业，一百五十八个单位；这样，学员的流动性特别大，平均到学的人数仅百分之七十左右。因此，有些区校成立了学生会，单位代表会和勤学互助组等组织，起了一定的保证和巩固学习的作用。
    区校的另一问题是兼课的中小学教职员时间不够支配，严重地影响到他们的健康和教学效果。但是有些学校如二区第七小学校长兼任工人业余学校校长，在校长下分设两个教导主任分别负责日、夜校的工作。减少了夜校的兼职教员，而以该项酬劳金加聘夜校的专任教员。这样，教员分为两批：一批以教日校为主，科任教员可以在夜校兼职；一批以教夜校为主，可以兼日校科任教员。这样，无需增加经费开支，而工人业余学校的领导则已加强。
    厂校的问题主要是教育局、市总工会、产业工会、现厂工会和行政等几个方面对于业余学校的领导关系不明确。在国营工厂中，这些关系显得更为复杂。中纺所属各纺织厂共有三万多工人，约占全市产业工人四分之一，而参加业余学校学习的不到四千人。原因之一在于领导关系不确定。有些厂的现场工会和行政负起了领导责任，工人业余学校就办得好一些；否则工人业余学校就是自流现象。
    厂校的另一个问题是一部分工厂行政只顾目前生产，对于通过学习以提高生产、改进生产的长远打算认识不足，对于工人业余学校不够重视，常因加班和开会而不能保证学习时间。像恒大烟草厂由于突击加班，以致业余学校常常停课，五月份头十七天只上了四天课；另一方面，有些工厂如天津制钢厂、自行车厂和中纺五厂都成立了包括厂长、军代表、工会主任、党总支书记、团总支书记及业余学校校长等的校务委员会，统一分配工人的业余时间，保证学习时间不开会、不加班，就使业余学校能巩固起来。
            政府领导，必须依靠工会
    “政府领导，依靠工会”，这是办好工人业余学校的基本原则，天津市总工会教育科和教育局工农教育科只有“合作”，没有“分工”：它将力量和教育局混合使用到工人业余学校的行政管理上去了，没有更多地考虑工会在工人教育中特殊的职责和作用，没有负起领导所属各产业工会、行业工会以及现场工会来推动与保证学习的责任，以致区校和厂校的巩固和发展都发生困难。个别产业工会和行业工会如市政工会原来办理了工人业余学校，以后看到政府负起领导工人教育的责任时，它们就将责任完全推开。
    同时，工农教育科这样一个组织机构，不能团结、组织与使用各方面和各级的力量，因此也就不易及时解决那些生产与学习的矛盾、统一保证学习时间以及经费统筹统支等重大的问题。
    因此，要进一步改进天津市工人业余教育，还待于扩大的包括全市各有关机关、团体的市、区和工厂的各级职工业余教育委员会的建立，并更进一步地掌握工人业余教育的方针，统一决定学制、课程、师资、经费等问题；市教育局工农教育科和工会更应该做到很适当的分工。
