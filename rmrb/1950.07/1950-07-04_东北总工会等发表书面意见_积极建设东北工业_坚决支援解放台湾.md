　　Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and Others Issue Written Opinions
    Actively Build Northeast Industry, Resolutely Support the Liberation of Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] Various people's organizations in Northeast China have issued written opinions, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's stern condemnation of the U.S. imperialist aggression. The written opinion of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions declares: Truman the robber's illegal statement and the actions of the U.S. imperialist air and naval forces are arrogant provocations against the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of all oppressed nations in the East. We resolutely oppose this act of aggression, actively build Northeast industry, support the People's Liberation Army, and fight to the end to drive out the U.S. imperialist aggressors and liberate Taiwan and all Chinese territories. The Northeast Working Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Northeast Student Federation emphasized in a joint written opinion: U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside; no matter how ferocious and evil it is, it cannot escape its ultimate doom. The written opinions of the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation and the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions all expressed extreme anger at the U.S. imperialist aggression and resolved to devote all their strength to supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and unanimously believed that final victory will surely belong to the Chinese people, the Korean people, and all the people of Asia.
