　　Department Stores Mass Process Orders and Purchase Goods to Promote the Resumption of Production in Private Industry

　　[Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper correspondent Si Gengsheng reports: Since April, the China Department Store has been allocating large amounts of funds each month to vigorously support private enterprises in various regions through acquisitions, orders, and processing. Department stores in various regions (excluding the Northeast) invested a total of 493.64699 billion yuan from April to early June. Among them, more than 400 billion yuan was used for acquisitions, orders, and processing.

　　In April and May, the head office acquired 100,080 bags of alkali from Yongli Chemical Company and 3,500 tons of ferrous sulfate, totaling 2,833.31 million yuan. It acquired 40,600 gross of various pencils from China Standard Pencil Factory, totaling 111.865 million yuan. It acquired 28,019 cases of glass from Yaohua Glass Company, totaling 3306.24 million yuan. In addition, the company exchanged glass worth 1011.25 million yuan with Yaohua Glass Company; and signed nationwide distribution contracts with China Standard Pencil Factory and Yaohua Glass Company. After the above support, Yongli Chemical Company and China Standard Pencil Factory were able to pay off the wages owed to workers and maintain reproduction. After Yaohua Glass Company obtained raw materials by exchanging finished products, it was able to continue reproduction. After signing the distribution contract, it removed sales offices in various places, saving a lot of expenses and solving its basic difficulties.

　　East China

　　In the East China region, 502 factories were acquired, ordered from, or processed for, with a total value of over 222.936659 billion yuan. These included stationery and instruments, knitwear, cotton textiles, enamel steel products, underwear, daily cosmetics, and other hardware, rubber and electrical materials, and leather goods. This accounts for over 40% of the total number of factories started by department stores. Among them, about 100 are large factories, and more than 400 are small and medium-sized factories. More than 30% of these factories were completely shut down before the department store provided support; and more than 30% were barely maintaining operations. In Shanghai, only five of the forty shirt factories were operating. After ordering 10,000 dozen shirts separately, all of them have now resumed work and feel that supply cannot meet demand. They are working overtime at night and have added temporary workers. Originally, the selling price was not enough to cover the cost, but now they generally have a profit of 5% to 10%. After acquiring products in April, Yifeng Enamel Factory saw improved sales and increased production from two kilns and six shifts to three kilns and eight shifts, with an increase in output of over 30%. The cotton textile industry, including towel and undershirt factories, had completely shut down. After the department store signed a processing contract with cotton mills such as Wuhe, Gonghe, and Yongxin for 23,000 dozen, they no longer reduced staff. For example, Pacific Textile Factory, the largest factory in the industry, was also preparing to reduce staff, but production was spared from shutdown after acquiring 200,000 dozen towels. The knitting industry was the most difficult, with only 21 of 148 knitting groups operating. After acquiring more than 50,000 dozen socks, more than 50 groups formed a joint venture and resumed normal production. After being acquired, Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory increased from only two days of work per week to five days. Other industries such as stationery, thermos containers, leather goods, shoes and hats, and electrical materials have also mostly resumed production after support.

　　North China

　　In the North China region, over 200 factories were acquired, ordered from, or processed for, with a total value of over 112.42467 billion yuan. Factories that were shut down or semi-shut down, such as Xincheng, Dasheng, and Guanghua paper mills, and Ruixing, Yuanji, Yongcheng, and Tongsheng knitting mills, have resumed production after being acquired. After the Shanghai-based Changle Cigarette Factory completed its equipment relocation to Tianjin, it coincided with a period of stable prices, making it impossible to start production. After the first batch of 25 cases of Apple brand cigarettes were ordered with tobacco leaves from the local products company, it was able to start production. In June, another 200 cases were ordered. Huayang Cigarette Factory was also able to continue production after successively ordering 600 cases through the exchange of finished products for tobacco leaves from the local products company or through order loans. The support for private enterprises through acquisitions, processing, and orders has gradually made the prices of industrial products more reasonable. For example, the price of sneakers per dozen has gradually increased from an average price of 290,000 yuan to 340,000 yuan, while stimulating product sales.

　　Central and Southern China

　　The total value of acquisitions, processing, and orders in the Central and Southern China region reached 19.92971 billion yuan. Over 800 pieces of various cotton yarns and patterned cloths, and 1,000 boxes of newsprint were entrusted to private sewing, printing, and knitting industries for processing, helping factories in various industries to overcome difficulties. From April 25th to May 20th, the Henan Provincial Company invested more than 1.1 billion yuan in Kaifeng City, ordering, acquiring, or processing from the leather, soap, stationery, knitwear, and match industries, as a result more than 20 leather industries gradually improved from a state of semi-shutdown production. From mid-April to mid-May, the Jiangxi Provincial Company acquired stagnant goods worth more than 800 million yuan from over 40 manufacturers in Nanchang City alone.

　　Southwest China

　　The total value of acquisitions, processing, and orders in the Southwest China region reached 14.80319 billion yuan. It acquired 1.5 million catties of sugar, enabling sugar factories in Neijiang to expand production. It acquired a batch of paper from Southwest Paper Mills, worth 2.3 billion yuan, and acquired over 100 dozen bottles of New Asia Thermos Factory and over 1,000 boxes of Yongxin Soap Factory soap, preventing the above factories from shutting down. In mid-May, it acquired part of the products of various industries, enabling 14 toothbrush factories, Yuhua Cloth Factory, Tiancheng Glass Factory, and handicraft leather factories that were in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown to resume production.

　　The Northwest District Company is still in the preparation stage, so the total value of purchases is only 26.5335 million yuan.

　　百货公司大批加工订货收购
    推动私营工业复工生产
    【本报讯】本报通讯员司更生报道：中国百货公司自四月份起逐月投放大批资金，通过收购、订货、加工等方式给各地私营企业以有力扶植。各地百货公司（东北除外）从四月份至六月上旬，共投放资金达四千九百三十六亿四千六百九十九万元。其中用在收购、订货、加工上的达四千亿元以上。
    总公司在四、五两月份计收购永利化学公司碱面十万零八千包，硫酸亚三千五百吨，共值二百八十三万三千一百万元。收购中国标准铅笔厂各种铅笔四万零六百罗，共值十一万一千八百六十五万元。收购耀华玻璃公司玻璃二万八千零一十九箱，共值三十三亿零六百二十四万元。另该公司又与耀华玻璃公司交换玻璃价值十亿零一千二百五十万元；并与中国标准铅笔厂、耀华玻璃公司签订了全国性的经销合同。经过以上扶植，永利化学公司与中国标准铅笔厂得以付清了拖欠工人的工资并维持了再生产。耀华玻璃公司经过以成品换得原料后，亦得以继续再生产；经过签订经销合同后，撤去了各地推销处，节省了大量开支，解决了本身的基本困难。
    华东
    华东区经过收购、订货、加工的工厂达五百零二家，总值达二千二百二十九亿三千六百五十九万余元。包括文具仪器、针织、棉织、搪瓷钢精、内衣、日用化妆品及其他五金、橡胶电器材料、皮件等行业。占百货工厂开工工厂总数的百分之四十强。其中大型工厂约一百家，中小工厂约四百余家。这些工厂有百分之三十以上，在百货公司未扶植前完全是停顿的；百分之三十以上是勉强维持的。上海市共有四十家衬衫业只有五家开工，经分别订货一万打后，现已全部复工，且已感到供不应求，兼开夜工，另又增添了临时工人。原来售价不够成本，现在一般均有百分之五至百分之十的利润。益丰搪瓷厂四月份经过收购产品后，销路好转，并从原来只开二窑做六班增至三窑八班，产量增加百分之三十以上。棉织业毛巾、汗衫工厂原已完全陷于停顿，经过百货公司与五和、公和、永新等棉织厂签订加工代织合约二万三千打后，已不再减工裁员。如该业范围最大的太平洋织造厂亦准备减工，经收购毛巾二十万打后，生产免于停顿。针织业是最困难的一业，电机组一百四十八家只有二十一家开工，经收购了五万多打袜子后，有五十多家组成了联营处，恢复了正常生产。大中华橡胶厂经收购后，由原来每星期只能开工两天增至五天。其他文具、保暖容器、皮件、鞋帽、电料等业，经过扶植后，大部也都恢复了生产。
    华北
    华北区经过收购、订货及加工的工厂达二百余家，总值达一千一百二十四亿二千四百六十七万余元。陷于停工半停工的工厂，如新成、大生、光华等纸厂，瑞兴、源记、永城、同生等针织厂，经过收购后，均已复工生产。由上海迁津之昌乐烟厂设备完成后，适值物价趋稳，无法开工，经首批以土产公司烟叶订货苹果牌纸烟二十五箱后，遂得开工；六月份又洽订二百箱。华阳烟厂亦经以土产公司烟叶交换成品或订货贷款方式陆续订货六百箱后，才得以继续生产。经过收购、加工及订货等方式对私营企业的扶植，促使工业品价格渐趋合理，如球鞋每打由平均价二十九万元逐步提升到三十四万元，同时刺激了产品的销路。
    中南
    中南区收购、加工及订货总值达一百九十九亿二千九百七十一万余元。以各种棉纱、花色布八百余匹，白报纸一千箱委托私营缝纫业、印刷业及针织业加工，帮助各业工厂度过困难。河南省公司自四月二十五日到五月二十日在开封市共投放资金十一亿多，向皮革、肥皂、文具、针织、火柴等业订货、收购或加工后，二十多家皮革业因之由生产半停顿状态渐趋好转。江西省公司自四月中旬至五月中旬，仅在南昌市即向四十余家厂商收购了价值八亿多元的滞销物品。
    西南
    西南区收购、加工及订货总值达一百四十八亿零三百一十九万元。收购了一百五十万斤糖，使内江各糖厂得以扩大生产。收购西南两纸厂一批纸，价值二十三亿元，收购新亚水瓶厂存货百余打，永新肥皂厂肥皂千余箱，使以上各厂都免于停业。五月份中又收购了各业部分产品，使处于停工半停工状态的十四家牙刷厂、裕华布厂、天成玻璃厂及手工业皮革厂等都恢复了生产。
    西北区公司由于正在筹备期间，故进货总值仅二亿六千五百三十五万元。
