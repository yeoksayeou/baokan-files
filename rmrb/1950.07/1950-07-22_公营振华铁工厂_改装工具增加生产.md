　　Publicly Operated Zhenhua Iron Factory
    Tool Modification Increases Production
    [This Newspaper's report] Since the publicly operated Zhenhua Iron Factory in Beijing launched a rationalization proposal and anti-waste campaign in April, significant results have been achieved in increasing production and saving resources. The factory's outsourced work mostly involves screws for transportation and agricultural equipment. It only had one small cutting machine with limited efficiency, which was often insufficient when needed.
    Niu Bufeng, the factory's deputy manager, noticed an unused iron drawing machine in the factory. He considered modifying this machine to add cutting functionality without hindering its original iron drawing capability. After multiple discussions with the workers and administrative approval of his suggestion, Bu Xiying, the head of the machine workshop, personally carried out the installation. The test results were excellent. After using the new cutting machine in June, it could cut more than 10,000 pieces a day, doubling the output compared to the small machine. The administrative department awarded Niu Bufeng 100,000 yuan and Bu Xiying 80,000 yuan.

　　公营振华铁工厂
    改装工具增加生产
    【本报讯】京市公营振华铁工厂四月份展开合理化建议及反浪费运动后，增产、节约收效显著。该厂承揽外活多系有关交通、农业器材的螺丝，只有一部效能很小的切料机，工作需要时，甚感不敷应用。
    工厂副理牛步峰看到厂内有部拔铁机搁着未用，他想把这部机器在不妨碍拔铁机能下来加装使用，经过多次与工友们商讨后，行政上也接受了他的建议，由机器间长布希英亲自按装，试验成绩良好。六月份使用新的切料机以后，一天能切一万多个，产量比小机器增加一倍。行政方面奖予牛步峰十万元、布希英八万元。
