Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The Working Committee of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a notice on the 4th, calling on people's organizations across the country to hold various forms of gatherings on July 7th to oppose the new aggression of U.S. imperialism in Asia and its interference in our country's liberation of Taiwan, and to support the patriotic struggles of the people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. The full text of the notice is as follows:

To all national people's organizations:

The 13th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War is approaching. Today, when the people of the world, especially the people of Far Eastern countries, are striving to defend world peace and oppose imperialist aggression, we request that people's organizations across the country combine the signature campaign to defend world peace on this day and hold various forms of gatherings, focusing on opposing the successors of Japanese imperialism—U.S. imperialism and its collaborators—in their new aggression in Asia. The Korean people are waging a sacred and heroic battle for the independence and unification of their country against the U.S. imperialist bandits and their running dogs. We must resolutely support the struggle of the Korean people. While attacking Korea, the U.S. imperialists also announced their intervention in our country's liberation of Taiwan, strengthened their intervention in the independent war of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the liberation struggle of the Filipino people, and strengthened the revival of Japanese aggressive forces while suppressing the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people's struggle for national independence. We must resolutely prepare to liberate Taiwan, support the struggles of the Vietnamese people, the Filipino people, and the Japanese people, and oppose the long-term occupation of Japan by U.S. imperialism, turning Japan into a U.S. colony and a new war base. We should use the experience of the Chinese people and the Asian people in the Anti-Japanese War to inspire the Asian people to oppose new aggression. Our slogans are: Asian people unite! Drive out the U.S. aggressors! Oppose the running dogs of the U.S. aggressors! Defend world peace with the Asian national liberation struggle! Long live the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War!
