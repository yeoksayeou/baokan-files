　　Six Hundred Young Students Arrive in Qinhuangdao
　　Daily Laughter and Singing While Bathing at the Seaside

　　[Report from this newspaper] Approximately six hundred male and female students from the Beijing Youth Summer Camp have arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 15th and 16th. In advance, Kailuan had prepared accommodation for the students: male students are residing in Kailuan South Warehouse and Kailuan Third Club; female students are residing in Kailuan First Club.

　　The students, who have lived in the city for a long time, are very excited to see the vast sea. Male and female students go to the beach for seawater bathing every day. The entire Qinhuangdao seaside is filled with the laughter and songs of youth.

　　Local people are also excited from the bottom of their hearts to see so many vibrant young men and women. An employee of the Kailuan Weighing Office pointed to the students swimming in the sea and said to his colleague beside him: "Look! How happy the youth of the New China are."

　　六百青年学生抵秦皇岛
    每日欢笑歌唱在海滨沐浴
    【本报讯】北京青年暑期夏令营男女同学约六百人，先后于十五、十六两日到达秦皇岛。事前开滦方面已为同学们预备好住处：男同学分住在开滦南栈房和开滦第三俱乐部；女同学住在开滦第一俱乐部。
    久居都市的同学们，看到了辽阔的大海，感到非常兴奋。男女同学们每天到海边作海水浴。整个的秦皇岛海滨充满了青年的欢笑歌唱。
    当地人们看到了这许多生气勃勃的青年男女，也都从心里感到兴奋。开滦磅房的一位职员，指着泳浮在海水中的同学们向他身旁的同事说：“你看！新中国青年多幸福。”
