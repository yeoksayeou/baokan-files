　　After Bandit Suppression, Rent Reduction, and Refund Movement
    Rural Work in Guangxi Enters a New Stage
    Rent Reduction and Bandit Elimination are Now Being Thoroughly Carried Out in Conjunction with Production
    [Report from this newspaper] In the half year since Guangxi Province was liberated, rural work has entered a new stage after the bandit suppression, rent reduction, and refund movement. Currently, rice transplanting has been completed throughout the province, and the rent reduction and refund movement is being carried out on a large scale in conjunction with production. The rent reduction movement in the Guilin Special District is expected to be completed by the end of June, while other special districts are generally expected to be completed in July or August.

    When the People's Liberation Army advanced into Guangxi last November, Bai Chongxi's fleeing bandits mixed local bandit forces with Kuomintang party members and members of the Youth League as well as military and political personnel from the puppet township, district, county, and special commissioner's offices, as well as special agents and hooligans, into bandit forces totaling about 50,000 people, who roamed the vast countryside, colluding with reactionary landlords and local bullies to carry out disturbances and sabotage. After the People's Liberation Army entered Guangxi, it first launched a bandit suppression movement combining military encirclement and suppression with political persuasion. From December last year to April this year, nearly 50,000 enemy bandits were eliminated in five months. The rural order in the province is now gradually stabilizing, and large bandit groups have been mostly eliminated or defeated. Only a few scattered small groups are still roaming in the mountainous areas of southeastern Guangxi, Liuzhou, and Yishan, and local troops are actively searching for them.

    The victory of the bandit suppression work has stabilized social order and removed the ideological concerns of the peasants. The basic key to the change in the situation and the development of work was mainly the implementation of the rent reduction and refund movement. Starting in late March this year, the province first concentrated cadres (the troops also began to work as work teams) for short-term training, conscientiously implemented the rent reduction and refund policy, and emphasized that the All-Circles Representatives' Conference and the Peasants' Representatives' Conference should be fully utilized in the movement to connect with, mobilize, and organize the masses. Subsequently, the rent reduction and refund movement was launched successively in Guilin, Liuzhou, Pingle, Nanning and other special districts, giving a ruthless blow to the rural feudal forces. In areas where the movement was carried out better, the peasants began to liberate themselves from thousands of years of feudal shackles, and legally obtained rent refunds, solving some of the difficulties in life and production materials. It is estimated that after the rent reduction movement in the Guilin Special District alone, the peasants will receive at least 10 million catties of refunded rent grain. The peasants' enthusiasm for production has been greatly increased, and they are actively carrying out sowing, transplanting, and reclaiming wasteland. According to incomplete statistics from some areas of seven counties in northern Guangxi, more than 10,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed after rent reduction.

    After the peasants broke the feudal rule, they urgently demanded the expansion of various organizations, the establishment of armed forces, and the transformation of the regime. Now, in all areas that have undergone rent reduction and rent refunds, preparatory committees for peasant associations have generally been established, and militia forces have been established in most areas. In the Guilin area, the militia generally cooperates with the troops in searching the mountains and suppressing scattered bandits.

    The first Guangxi Provincial Peasants' Representative Conference was held on June 8, establishing the Provincial Peasants' Association, summarizing past peasant movements, and deciding to correct past deviations in the movement, such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants, as well as the commandist and paternalistic work style of cadres, and to correct policies. In the future, a large-scale mass movement combining production with rent reduction and rent refunds will be launched throughout the province.

　　经过剿匪减租退租运动
    广西农村工作进入新阶段
    现正结合生产深入开展减租清匪
    【本报讯】广西省解放半年来，经过剿灭股匪、减租退租运动，农村工作已进入新的阶段。现全省插秧已经完毕，减租退租运动正结合生产大规模地展开。桂林专区六月底减租运动即可结束，其他专区一般可在七、八月间结束。
    去年十一月间解放大军挺进广西，白匪崇禧在溃逃之前，曾将当地土匪武装和伪乡、区、县、专署等各级军政人员、特务流氓分子，混合编成土匪队伍，共约五万余人，流窜于广大农村，与反动地主恶霸相勾结，进行扰乱破坏。解放军进入广西后，首先开展了以军事进剿与政治争取相结合的剿匪运动。自去年十二月至今年四月，五个月内，共消灭敌匪近五万名。现全省农村秩序已渐趋安定，大股土匪已大部被消灭或击溃，仅有若干零星小股尚流窜于桂东南、柳州、宜山等山地，当地驻军正积极搜剿中。
    剿匪工作的胜利，安定了社会秩序，解除了农民思想顾虑，而局势转变、工作开展的基本关键，主要是进行了减租退租运动。从今年三月下旬开始，该省首先集中干部（部队也开始工作队化）进行短期训练，认真贯彻减租、退租政策，并强调在运动中要充分运用各界代表会和农民代表会，联系、发动组织群众。接着减租退租运动便先后在桂林、柳州、平乐、南宁等专区先后展开，对农村封建势力予以无情的打击。运动开展较好的地区，农民便开始从几千年来的封建束缚下解放出来，并依法得到了退租粮，解决了一部生活和生产资料的困难。据估计，仅桂林专区全区在减租运动结束后，农民即可得退租粮至少一千万斤。农民生产情绪已大为提高，积极进行播种、插秧，开垦荒地。仅据桂北七个县部分地区不完全统计，经过减租后即开荒一万余亩。
    农民打破了封建统治后，就迫切要求扩大各种组织，建立武装与改造政权。现在凡经过减租退租的地区，一般的都成立了农会筹备会，大部建立了民兵武装。在桂林地区，民兵普遍配合部队搜山，清剿散匪。
    广西省首届农民代表会已于六月八日召开，成立了省农民协会，并对过去的农民运动加以总结，决定纠正过去运动中侵犯中农利益等偏向和干部命令、包办作风，端正政策。今后将在全省范围内展开大规模的生产与减租退租相结合的群众运动。
