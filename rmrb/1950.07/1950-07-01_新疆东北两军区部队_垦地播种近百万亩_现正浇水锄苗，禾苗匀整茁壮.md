Xinhua News Agency, Dihua Dispatch: The agricultural and sideline production of the People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region troops has achieved great results. As of the end of May, the entire army had reclaimed 800,000 mu of land, exceeding the military region's original plan of 600,000 mu by 33%. The field sowing work has been completed, and watering and weeding are now underway. In terms of water conservancy projects: the Dihua Peace Canal, the Yili Huang Canal, the Shawan Taiping and Xinsheng Canals, the Yanqi New Canal, the Honghai Reservoir, and the Aksu, Suilai, and Hami Canals have been built successively, which can irrigate more than 1 million mu of land. In terms of sideline production: the entire army has established 37 coal kilns, 11 oil presses, 85 flour mills, 8 soap factories, 4 oil extraction plants, and 1 each of blanket, towel, and sock factories, 3 paper mills, and 2 gold mines. In terms of animal husbandry: more than 5,000 cattle, nearly 70,000 sheep, more than 14,000 pigs, and nearly 50,000 chickens have been raised. In addition, 200,000 trees have been planted. There have also been great achievements in terms of conservation, with the units directly under the military region saving more than 144,000 jin of grain in May alone.

Xinhua News Agency: The spring sowing work of the Northeast Military Region troops was basically completed by early June. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 60,000 mu of paddy fields and more than 110,000 mu of dry land have been sown. All paddy fields are planted with rice, and the dry land is mostly sown with sorghum and corn, followed by wheat, upland rice, cotton, and hemp. The seedlings have all emerged, are growing evenly and strongly, and are lush green. The South Manchuria troops have finished the first weeding, and the North Manchuria troops have also started weeding in some areas. In the spring plowing and sowing work, the cadres can carefully organize labor, carry out scientific division of labor, carefully study technology, and guide the work in a timely manner. For example, Gao, the deputy commander of the Liaoxi Military Region, and Wang, the deputy division commander of a certain division, personally went to the Panshan Farm during the sowing period to study production technology, guide the work of various departments, and organize mutual visits to exchange experience. In order to solve the rice field sowing technology, the farm of a certain division sent people to the Liaoxi Provincial Agricultural Station (agricultural technology leading authority) to study before sowing, and transferred a group of people for centralized training. The troops planting large fields can form plowing, sowing, and other groups according to the strength of their physical strength and the level of production technology, and clearly divide the labor. Most companies have organized production research groups to be responsible for planning and inspection work. The enthusiasm of the troops for labor is extremely high. Various departments have launched mutual assistance challenge competitions. The soldiers have all formulated plans, focusing on striving to join the League, join the Party, or make meritorious service in production. Xu Fengrui, a member of a certain unit, often helps comrades in the class who are physically weak to work. He takes the lead in striving for a model class as a condition for striving to join the Party. Cadres and party members have always stood on the front line. For example, He, the deputy company commander of the eighth company of a certain unit, took the lead in participating in the arduous task of land reclamation. Every time he came out of the reed pond, he was covered in mud. From the beginning to the end, the foreign plow never left his hand. Li Cai, a party member of a certain unit, wiped the ploughshare clean regardless of his fatigue during land reclamation rest. He said, "The horse doesn't have to work hard, so it can move forward smoothly." Many new records have also been created in sowing. For example, the sixth company of a certain unit completed the sowing task for fourteen days in six days, and the sowing was very good. Therefore, a large number of activists and heroes have emerged in many units. At the summary meeting of a certain division, more than 200 heroes were awarded.

　　新疆东北两军区部队
    垦地播种近百万亩
    现正浇水锄苗，禾苗匀整茁壮
    【本报讯】据新华社迪化电：人民解放军新疆军区部队农业、副业生产成绩巨大，截至五月底，全军已开垦土地八十万亩，超过军区原定六十万亩计划的百分之三十三。田地播种工作已告完成，现正进行浇水锄草中。在水利工程方面：先后修建迪化和平渠，伊犁皇渠，沙湾太平、新盛两渠，焉耆新渠及洪海水库，及阿克苏、绥来和哈密大渠等水利工程，可灌溉土地一百余万亩。副业生产方面：全军已建立煤窑三十七座，油坊十一座，面粉坊八十五座，肥皂厂八所，榨油厂四所，毛毯、毛巾、织袜厂各一所，造纸厂三所，金矿两座。畜牧业方面：已养牛五千余头，羊近七万只，猪一万四千余口，鸡近五万只。此外并植树二十万株。节约方面亦有很大的成绩，仅军区直属队五月份节省粮食即达十四万四千余斤。
    【本报讯】东北军区各部队春季播种工作至六月初旬止，已基本完成。据初步统计，共播种水田六万余亩，旱田十一万余亩。水田全部种稻，旱田播种以高粱、苞米为最多，小麦、旱稻、棉、麻等次之。禾苗均已出齐，长得匀整茁壮，一片葱绿。南满部队已锄完头遍，北满部队亦已部分开始锄苗。在春耕播种工作中，干部都能认真组织劳力，进行科学分工，细心研究技术，及时指导工作。如辽西军区高副司令员及某师王副师长即在播种期间，亲赴盘山农场，研究生产技术，指导各部工作，并组织互相参观，交流经验。某师农场为了解决稻田播种技术，在播种前派人到辽西省农站（农业技术领导机关）进行学习，并抽调一部分人员集中训练。种大田的各部队，都能按体力强弱和生产技术高低编成扶犁、播种等组，明确分工。多数连队都组织了生产研究小组，负责计划和检查工作。部队劳动热情，异常高涨，各部展开了互助挑战竞赛，战士们都订立了计划，中心在生产中争取入团、入党或立功。某部团员徐凤瑞经常帮助班里身体弱的同志劳动，他以带头争取模范班做为争取入党的条件。干部、党员一向是站在最前线，如某部八连贺副连长，带头参加了艰巨的开荒任务，每次从苇塘里出来，都是满身泥水，从开始到结束，洋犁从没有离开过他的手。某部党员李才开荒休息时，不顾疲劳地把铧子擦的净亮，他说：“马拉着不费力气，好顺利前进。”播种中也创造了许多新纪录，如某部六连六天工夫，完成十四天的播种任务，并且种得很好。因此许多单位涌现了大批积极分子和功臣。某师在总结会上，就有二百余名功臣受奖。
