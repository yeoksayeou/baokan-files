　　The Atomic Bomb and God
    Lin Danqiu
    After suffering a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Korean people's counterattack, the U.S. imperialist invading forces, in addition to continuing to mobilize troops, turned to two magic weapons for help: the atomic bomb and God.
    A report on the 19th of this month stated: "American reactionaries are currently putting forward all kinds of wild plans, including the barbaric suggestion of using atomic weapons against the Korean people. These suggestions were encouraged by Acheson's statement at a press conference on July 12th..."
                    (New China News Agency, 18th, excerpts from TASS)
    Imperialists always regard weapons of mass destruction as omnipotent treasures and war as the only way out. However, it is the weapons they themselves manufacture and the wars they themselves launch that will bury imperialism. The Trumans are following Hitler's old path!
    Now they actually plan to trot out the atomic bomb to threaten the Korean people, but the roar of defending world peace and prohibiting atomic bombs has drowned out the cries of the warmongers. The explosion of one atomic bomb will inevitably trigger the explosion of thousands upon thousands of atomic bombs buried in the hearts of people all over the world; the consequences of that for the White House are foreseeable. So what to do? Look:
    "U.S. President Truman, only twenty-odd days after issuing a menacing statement on armed intervention in Korea, is again seeking God's blessing. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, dated the 14th, Truman prayed with a preacher named Graham on the 10th, asking for God's blessing to help him and his country through the current difficult period..."
                                      (New China News Agency, 19th)
    One moment baring fangs and claws, ravenously devouring people; the next, crestfallen, kneeling before God for help. This is precisely the true form of U.S. imperialism, strong in appearance but weak in reality, the true nature of a paper tiger!
    No matter what arduous road the Korean people may take in the war against American aggression, they will undoubtedly achieve final victory. Neither the atomic bomb nor God can "help him and his country through the current difficult period," just as bacteria and poison gas could not help Hitler and Tojo and their "countries" through their "difficult periods." The Chinese people, having gone through eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of the War of Liberation, understand this particularly deeply.

　　原子弹和上帝
    林淡秋
    美帝国主义的侵略军在朝鲜人民的反击下遭受惨败之后，杜鲁门和艾奇逊之流，除继续调兵遣将之外，又向两个法宝求助：一个是原子弹，另一个是上帝。
    本月十九日报载：“美国反动派目前正在提出各种狂妄的计划，包括使用原子武器对付朝鲜人民的野蛮建议。这些建议得到艾奇逊七月十二日在记者招待会上发表的声明的鼓励……”
                    （新华社十八日摘录塔斯社讯）
    帝国主义总把杀人武器看作万能的宝贝，把战争看作唯一的出路。可是埋葬帝国主义的正是它自己制造的武器，正是它自己发动的战争。杜鲁门们正走着希特勒的老路！
    现在他们居然打算捧出原子弹来威胁朝鲜人民了，可是保卫世界和平、禁用原子弹的吼声淹没了战争贩子们的叫嚣。一颗原子弹的爆炸必然会引起千千万万颗埋藏在全世界人民的心里的原子弹的爆炸，对于白宫来说，那后果是可以预见的。那么怎么办呢？看吧：
    “美总统杜鲁门在发表了气势汹汹的武装干涉朝鲜的声明仅仅二十多天之后，又在求神保祐了。据法新社华盛顿十四日电称，杜鲁门在十日曾与一位名叫格拉汉的布道员一同祈求上帝的保祐，以帮助他与他的国家度过目前困难的时期。……”
                                      （新华社十九日讯）
    忽而张牙舞爪，血口噬人；忽又垂头丧气，跪在上帝跟前求救。这正是外强中干的美帝国主义的原形，一只纸老虎的本相！
    不管朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略的战争中可能走什么样艰苦的道路，他们会获得最后的胜利，那是确定无疑的。原子弹也好，上帝也好，都不能“帮助他与他的国家度过目前困难的时期”，正如细菌和毒气不能帮助希特勒和东条及其“国家”度过“困难的时期”一样。这一点，经过八年抗战和四年解放战争的中国人民是了解得特别深刻的。
