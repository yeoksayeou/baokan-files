　　Soviet Factory Internal Economic Accounting
    Li He
    On June 23, 1931, Stalin made a wise instruction at a meeting of Soviet economic workers. This instruction stated: "To eliminate waste, make the most of internal industrial resources, implement and consolidate economic accounting in all our enterprises, systematically reduce costs, and strengthen internal industrial accumulation in all, without exception, industrial sectors."
    The socialist economic management method being widely and deeply promoted in the Soviet Union—economic accounting—is the concrete implementation of this instruction. This economic accounting system aims to complete production plans in the best possible way with the least amount of labor, materials, and funds, and to create above-plan accumulation. Various industrial sectors in the Soviet Union have launched a competition to save raw materials, materials, and to more fully utilize fixed and circulating capital. (Note: Fixed capital includes buildings, machinery, equipment, etc. Circulating capital includes raw materials, fuel, semi-finished or manufactured goods awaiting sale, and cash, etc.)
    Economic accounting has become a powerful lever for striving to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. For example, the Upper Pyshminsk Metallurgical Plant actively implemented economic accounting in 1949. By accelerating the turnover rate of circulating capital and reducing product costs, it saved 5.4 million rubles above plan. In the first quarter of this year, it saved 390,000 rubles by more fully utilizing fixed capital.
    Factories implementing economic accounting need to stipulate standards for production costs, output quotas, and the extent of equipment and material usage. The products of these factories are sold at wholesale prices, which are calculated based on the planned product cost, profit, and commodity tax. Cost is the most important part of the price. Uniformly stipulated commercial taxes are an item of income in the state budget. A portion of the profit is allocated to a fund to encourage hardworking staff. Only factories that complete production plans, reduce costs, and increase accumulation establish such funds. This fund generally accounts for 1 to 5 percent of the planned profit and 15 to 45 percent of the above-plan profit, and is used to pay bonuses, vacation expenses, part of the costs of kindergarten summer camps, housing, and subsidies for cultural venues, etc.

    Inside Soviet factories, economic accounting is carried out in every production link—workshops, workshop sections, production groups, and even individual staff members. Workshop economic accounting is the most common method, and individual economic accounting is the newest method.

    Workshop economic accounting is based on the overall factory production plan. The content of workshop economic accounting varies depending on the production tasks, but generally includes the following points: (1) Production tasks (product quality, variety); (2) Consumption of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity in completing the specified production tasks; (3) Tasks in terms of the number of staff, average wage level, labor productivity, and wage fund; (4) Cost per product, that is, the cost from manufacturing semi-finished products and assembling parts to creating a finished product; (5) Workshop expenses.
    The experience of advanced Soviet factories proves that product cost economic accounting plays a significant role in workshop economic accounting. The advantages of calculating the workshop cost of products are: (1) Calculating the workshop cost of products makes it easier to identify those who are wasting resources, and can encourage everyone to actively find ways to save during the production process; (2) It can more accurately check the use of fixed and circulating capital; (3) It can more effectively lead lower-level production links. The Upper Pyshminsk, Lower Serginsky, and Alapayevsk metallurgical plants have all experienced the benefits of using this type of cost calculation because using this calculation can check the use of every ruble.

    The implementation of workshop economic accounting requires strict preparation in advance. Each workshop needs to know how production costs are composed and what impact the labor results of the workshop have on the overall production tasks of the factory. In advanced factories in the Soviet Union, you can see propaganda posters in almost every workshop, indicating how much one thousand kilograms of raw materials are worth, how much is lost if a machine stops for an hour, and so on.

    In addition to workshop accounting, Soviet factories are now also promoting the implementation of economic accounting in lower-level production links. The more deeply economic accounting penetrates into lower-level production links, the more it can mobilize the broad masses of workers to solve issues related to savings, and the more it can strengthen their sense of cherishing people's property.

    The day and night workshops of the Upper Pyshminsk Metallurgical Plant implement economic accounting for three work shifts that rotate. The task of shift economic accounting is to determine several of the most important expenses (metal, electricity, fuel, wages, etc.) in the shift during iron rolling. After economic accounting, it is possible to know exactly what the shift can save, and to set out cost calculations for iron rolling for each shift. The results of economic accounting enabled the three shifts to save 849,000 rubles above plan in one year.

    Various factories, especially metallurgical factories, are promoting the economic accounting of linked machines such as blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. Because the production process of smelting iron involves various production groups in the shifts, it cannot be calculated on a shift or individual basis. Every open-hearth furnace at the Upper Pyshminsk Metallurgical Plant implements economic accounting, stipulating standards for steel production and expenses. In the first quarter of this year, the open-hearth furnace saved 62,300 rubles above plan due to economic accounting.
    Individual economic accounting was initiated by steel casting worker Chaika and others at the Upper Pyshminsk Metallurgical Plant, and was extended to various factories in the second half of 1948. Initially, the content of individual economic accounting was limited to the scope of those participating in the production competition undertaking to complete production quotas ahead of schedule or above plan. After Zhutkik initiated the movement to produce superior quality products, individual economic accounting also included the calculation of product quality. Later, savings achievements were also included. After that, individual economic accounting was named individual savings accounting. Another form of individual savings accounting is the "Savings Book," which not only records the savings of materials, but also the savings of equipment repair costs.

    Implementing individual economic accounting allows every staff member to know: how much the materials he processes are worth, how much loss unqualified products give to the factory, how the cost of products is calculated, and what the benefits of using materials and cash purposefully and economically are, and so on. Therefore, the individual savings accounting form generally includes work achievements, expense standards, savings amounts, and other items. In the forging workshop of the Stalin Tractor Factory, the individual savings accounting form records the savings of heavy oil, steam, electricity, and tools, and the gradual reduction of losses caused by substandard products. The "Savings Book" of the Ural Stalin Automobile Factory reflects: the planned expense amount and the actual expense amount, the amount of savings, rationalization suggestions and their effects, the amount of bonuses, and so on. The 1949-1950 individual savings calculation form of the Frezil Factory indicates: the task within a certain working time and the percentage of its completion, the percentage of superior quality product production, the total amount of waste loss, the savings of metal, fuel, electricity, tools, and incidental materials, the reduction of equipment repair costs, participation in technical studies, and the receipt of awards in the competition to improve product quality and savings, etc.
    Individual savings accounting clearly reflects whether each staff member has saved or wasted. Savers therefore receive material rewards, so individual savings accounting is very effective. The "Savings Book" of the Ural Stalin Automobile Factory recorded a total savings of 1,519,000 rubles in 1949, including 942,000 rubles in savings of materials and fuel, 135,000 rubles in savings of tools, 316,000 rubles in savings from reducing waste, and 126,000 rubles in savings from extending the working life of equipment.

    The method of calculating savings or waste in cash is most likely to attract the attention of those who implement individual savings accounting, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for saving and producing superior products. Before the implementation of individual economic accounting in the lime water workshop of an alkali production factory, the specified standard for the concentration of lime water had not been reached for a long time. After the widespread implementation of individual economic accounting, the concentration of lime water was never lower than the specified standard for a single day. Because after the implementation of individual economic accounting, the measuring instrument was changed to be calculated in rubles, the waste caused by insufficient concentration was expressed as a cash amount, which was very specific and eye-catching, and was quickly corrected.

　　苏联的厂内经济核算
    李何
    在一九三一年六月二十三日，斯大林曾在苏联经济工作人员会议上作了一项英明的指示。这个指示说：“要消灭浪费现象，尽量动用工业内部的资源，在我们所有一切企业内施行并巩固经济核算制，有系统地减低成本费，在所有一切而无例外的工业部门里加强工业内部的积累。”
    苏联现正广泛而深入地推行着的社会主义经济管理方法——经济核算制，便是这一指示的具体执行。这种经济核算制，就是为了用最少的劳动力，最少的材料和资金，来最好地完成生产计划，并且创造出超计划的积累。苏联各工业部门已经展开了节约原料、材料和更充分地利用固定资金与流动资金的竞赛运动。（注：固定资金包括房屋、机器、装备等。流动资金包括原料、燃料、待卖出的半制成品或制造品、现金等。）
    经济核算制已经成为争取先期完成战后斯大林五年计划的有力杠杆。例如，上普施茨克冶金工厂一九四九年积极施行了经济核算制，由于加速了流动资金的周转率，减低了产品的成本，结果超计划地节约了五百四十万卢布；今年第一季，由于更充分地利用固定资金因而节约了三十九万卢布。
    施行经济核算制的工厂，需要规定生产费用的标准、出产的定额、使用装备和材料的程度等。这些工厂的产品，是以批发价格售出的，而批发价格是根据计划上规定的产品成本、利润和商品税来计算的。成本是价格的最主要部分。统一规定的商业税，则为国家预算中收入的一项。利润中的一部分被拨作鼓励努力生产的工作人员的基金。只有那些完成生产计划，而且减低了成本和增加了积累的工厂，才设置这种基金。这种基金一般地占计划内的利润的百分之一到五，和超计划的利润的百分之十五到四十五，用以支付奖金、休养费、幼稚园儿童营的部分费用、住宅和文化场所的补助费等。
    在苏联工厂内部，各个生产环节——车间、车间分部、生产组之中以至每个工作人员都进行着经济核算制。车间经济核算制是最普遍的方式，个人经济核算制是最新的方式。
    车间经济核算是根据全厂生产计划来规定的。车间经济核算的内容因生产任务的不同而各异，但一般都包括下列几点：（一）生产任务（产品的质量、种类）；（二）在完成规定的生产任务时，原料、材料、燃料、电力的消费；（三）工作人员数目、平均工资水平、劳动生产率方面的任务、工资基金；（四）每件产品成本，亦即从制造半制成品、装配零件到造成一件产品的费用；（五）车间费用。
    苏联先进工厂的经验证明，产品成本的经济核算，在车间经济核算中作用极大。产品的车间成本计算的好处在于：（一）计算产品的车间成本，容易发现那些人浪费了，可以推动大家更积极地在生产过程中设法节约；（二）可以更精密地检查固定资金和流动资金的用途；（三）可以更有效地领导下级的生产环节。上普施茨克、下薛尔金斯克和阿拉巴耶夫斯克三个冶金工厂，都体验到采用这种成本计算的好处，因为使用这种计算，可以检查出每一个卢布的用途。
    施行车间的经济核算，事先要有严格的准备。每一车间要知道生产费用是如何构成的，和本车间的劳动成果对于全厂总的生产任务有什么影响。在苏联的先进工厂里，几乎在每一个车间都可以看到宣传画，标明着一千公斤原料值多少钱，机器停一个钟头损失多少等等。
    除了车间核算以外，苏联工厂现在还提倡在更下级的生产环节中施行经济核算。经济核算愈深入到下层生产环节去，就愈能动员广大工人群众来解决有关节约的问题，就愈能加强他们对于人民财产的爱护心。
    上普施茨克冶金工厂昼夜工作的车间，轮流替换的三个工作班都施行经济核算。班经济核算的任务，是拟定在辗铁时班内几项最重要的费用（金属、电力、燃料、工资等）。经过经济核算后，可以精确地知道班可以节约什么，可以替每个班订出辗铁的成本计算。经济核算的结果，使三个班在一年内超计划节约了八十四万九千卢布。
    各个工厂，尤其是冶金工厂，都推行着熔炉、马丁炉等联动机的经济核算。因为象熔铁这种生产过程，关系到轮班的各生产组，所以不能以班或以个人作单位来计算。上普施茨克冶金工厂的每一个马丁炉都施行经济核算，拟定产钢量和费用标准。今年第一季马丁炉由于经济核算而超计划节约了六万二千三百卢布。
    个人经济核算是由上普施茨克冶金工厂铸钢工人查伊卡等创始的，一九四八年下半年推广到各工厂。起初，个人经济核算的内容，只限于参加生产竞赛者承担提前完成或超计划地完成生产定额的范围。在朱特基克发起出产优等质量的产品运动之后，个人经济核算又包括了产品质量的计算在内。后来，把节约成绩也列进去了。这以后，个人经济核算就被名为个人节约核算。个人节约核算的另一种形式是“储金簿”，在簿上不但写明了材料的节约情形，而且也记有装备修理费用的节约情形。
    施行个人经济核算，可以使每一个工作人员知道：他所加工的材料值多少钱，不合格的产品给了工厂多大的损失，产品的成本是怎样计算的，有目的地和节约地使用物资和现金有什么好处等等。所以，个人节约核算表一般包括了工作成绩、费用标准、节约数目等项。在斯大林拖拉机工厂的锻铁车间内，个人节约核算表上填写着重油、蒸汽、电力、工具的节约情形，和因产品不合标准而带来的损失逐渐减少的情形。乌拉尔斯大林汽车工厂的《储金簿》上反映着：预定的费用额和实际的费用额、节约数目、合理化建议及其效果、奖金数目等等。佛列芝尔工厂一九四九——一九五零年个人节约计算表标明着：一定工作时间内的任务及其完成的百分数，优等质量产品的生产的百分数，废品的损失总数，金属、燃料、电力、工具、附带材料的节约，装备修理费的减少，技术学习的参加，以及在提高产品质量和节约的竞赛中的受奖等等情形。
    个人节约核算清楚地反映出每个工作人员是节约了还是浪费了。节约者因此得到物质上的奖励，所以个人节约核算收效很大。乌拉尔斯大林汽车工厂的《储金簿》上记载了一九四九年节约总额计一百五十一万九千卢布，其中节约材料和燃料九十四万二千卢布，节约工具十三万五千卢布，减少废品节约了三十一万六千卢布，延长装备的工作期限节约了十二万六千卢布。
    以现金计算节约了或是浪费了的办法，最能引起施行个人节约核算者的注意，因而提高他们节约和生产优等产品的积极性。有一个造碱工厂的产石灰水车间，在施行个人经济核算之前，规定的石灰水的浓度标准，很久都没有达到。到了普遍施行个人经济核算之后，石灰水的浓度没有一天低过规定的标准。因为施行个人经济核算之后，测量器改用卢布计算，因浓度不足而引起的浪费情形，表现为现金数目，就非常具体而醒目，很快就得到纠正了。
