　　Review and Statement
　　After our journal published "Recommending a Batch of Popular Readings" written by comrades Bo Han and Chong Wen in the seventh issue, we received letters from readers. Some pointed out that the book "Comrade Zhao" had poor content, some said that the recommended books had omissions, and some pointed out that there were errors in some book titles and publishers' names. Now, comrades Bo Han and Chong Wen have made the following review and statement:
　　"In our article 'Recommending a Batch of Popular Readings,' because we did not collect publications widely enough, and only wrote about some books we had recently come into contact with, omissions were inevitable. On the other hand, we did not read some books carefully enough, leading us to list works that were not worth recommending. For example, 'Comrade Zhao,' although the author's subjective intentions were good, the characters are not realistic, the ideological expression is superficial, and the effect may be the opposite, lacking educational significance, yet we recommended it. We review ourselves, this is a careless mistake. In the future, we will widely search for popular readings and earnestly continue to recommend them.
　　Furthermore: the publishers of 'The Zoo' and 'World of Birds' are the Education Publishing House, mistakenly written as Education Bookstore; 'Timur and His Story' should be 'Timur and His Team'; 'Yang Gui Xiang' should be 'Yang Guixiang,' and we hereby correct these errors."
　　In the "Voice of Readers" column of the fifth issue of this journal, we reflected the opinions of Jinan reader Guan Feng regarding the "People's Charter Learning Materials" published by Tianjin Joint Publishing House. We now excerpt the following from a letter received from the publishing house:
　　"We have read the criticism of 'People's Charter Learning Materials' by Comrade Guan Feng of Jinan in the 'Book Review' No. 5 'Voice of Readers,' and we are very grateful. In the past, due to our negligence, we failed to correct individual inappropriate articles and typos in the book in a timely manner. This shows that we have not been serious and earnest enough in our publishing work for the people, and we should deeply examine ourselves. The article 'The Fundamental Differences between the People's Political Consultative Conference and the Old Political Consultative Conference' mentioned by Comrade Guan Feng has been revised in the eighth edition; other places have also been revised considerably. From the ninth edition onwards, it has been completely reset and typos corrected. However, we fear that there may still be inappropriate or even erroneous places, and we hope that readers of your journal will offer criticism and guidance so that we can continue to make corrections."
　　Sanlian Bookstore has made the following statement regarding the translator's preface and appendix to "Beethoven's Biography":
　　"We are very grateful for Mr. Mei Guanhua's criticism of the preface by Mr. Fu Lei, the translator of 'Beethoven's Biography' published by our store, and the article 'Beethoven's Works and Their Spirit' in the appendix (published in the fifth issue of this journal on May 31). Mr. Mei's criticism further points out that our store has failed to revise many places that must be modified when reprinting books published before liberation, and is indifferent to the content of reprinted books. We are willing to sincerely accept this criticism and have begun to re-examine the publications of our store since liberation in order to make the necessary improvements."

### 检讨与声明

　　检讨与声明
    本刊第七期刊载了伯韩、崇文两同志所写的《推荐一批通俗读物》后，接到读者来信，有的指出《赵同志》一书内容不好，有的说推荐的书有遗漏，有的指出有些书名和出版者的名字有误。现在，伯韩、崇文二同志作了如下的检讨与声明如下：
    “我们所写的《推荐一批通俗读物》，因为我们搜集出版物不够普遍，只是就最近接触到的一些书来写的，因此不免挂一漏万。另一方面，有些书看得不仔细，以至于开列了值不得推荐的作品。如《赵同志》，作者的主观意图虽好，但人物不真实，思想表现肤浅，所得效果可能相反，是没有教育意义的，我们也推荐了。我们自己检讨，这是犯了粗枝大叶的毛病。今后我们还要广泛地搜求通俗读物，认真地继续推荐。
    再：《动物园》和《飞禽天地》的出版者是教育出版社，误为教育书店；《铁木儿和他的故事》应为《铁木儿和他的伙伴》；《杨贵香》应为《杨桂香》，并此改正。”
    本刊第五期《读者之声》栏反映了济南读者关锋对于天津联合图书出版社所出《人民大宪章学习资料》的意见。兹接该社来函摘登如次：
    “我们读了《图书评论》第五号《读者之声》中济南关锋同志对于《人民大宪章学习资料》的批评，十分感激。过去由于我们的疏忽，以致未能及时改正书中个别不妥的文章和错字，这是我们对于人民的出版工作，做得还不够认真和严肃，应该深自检讨的。关锋同志所提的《人民政协和旧政协基本上的不同》一文，我们在第八版中已经作了改正；其他的地方也改正了不少。第九版起并已彻底重排，改正错字。但恐仍有不妥甚至错误的地方，希望贵刊读者予以批评指教，以便继续改正。”
    三联书店对《贝多芬传》译序和附录问题作了如下的声明：
    “梅关桦先生对我店出版的《贝多芬传》中译者傅雷先生的序和附录的《贝多芬作品及其精神》一文提出的批评（发表于五月三十一日本刊第五期），我们很感谢。梅先生的批评，更指出我店在重印解放以前出版过的书籍时，有许多必须修改的地方不修改，对重版书的内容漫不经心。我们愿意诚恳地接受这一批评，并已开始重审我店解放以来的出版物，以便作应有的改进。”
