　　I and My Wife Signed a "Guaranteed Teaching and Learning Contract"
　　Political Department of a certain Division, Taishan

　　My wife, Comrade Li Yumei, is a woman of peasant origin. Since joining the army in 1947, she has made considerable progress in her ideological awareness and habits through several years of training. In particular, she has maintained excellent habits of thrift and learned scientific methods of childcare. These are the things I admire about her. But she has one major problem: she doesn't like to study. Over the years, she has never studied properly at the workers' school. Now she can barely recognize more than thirty characters, and can write less than half of them. Some she can't explain, and some she uses incorrectly.

　　This spring, the army launched a campaign to eliminate illiteracy. One day I said to her, "The higher-ups want to eliminate illiteracy within a year and a half. You have to study hard too. I'll teach you every day, okay?" She frowned and said, "Will you hold the baby for me?" I said, "It's not impossible to learn while holding the baby!" I gave many examples, saying that there is time, it just depends on whether you want to learn. "I just won't learn. If the army doesn't want me, I'll take the baby to the factory, there's always a way." "The factory also wants to eliminate illiteracy, workers' learning is even more intense!" I explained the benefits of learning again and again, but her reply was: "I can't remember, it's a waste of time." "You cause less trouble, find less faults!" "Forcing an old horse to gallop, why didn't you teach me when you were younger!"... I nagged for a long time.

　　After the production tasks were assigned, she started making shoes. They were sturdy and well-made. As soon as she made a pair, comrades wanted a pair, so she made them all day long. If I tried to talk to her about learning, she would righteously say, "So-and-so knows a lot of characters but can't make shoes, so-and-so makes them but no one wants them, what good is their education?" Just as I was about to argue with her, she grabbed the soles, hemp rope, picked up the baby, and hurried away.

　　I remember several evenings, I still talked to her slowly, and she would doze off and agree, saying she would start the next day, but when dawn came, it was the same as before!

　　On April 14th, my eldest daughter, Hangying, sent a letter from the children's school. The children are innocent and straightforward, and their opinions are very sharp. The letter said, "Mom doesn't study hard, which means she doesn't seek progress. She's been out for several years, and in the past, she said Dad wasn't here, so she wasn't in the mood to study. Now that we've won and she's with Dad, why doesn't she still study? I hope Mom won't fall behind, study hard, and be a mother of the new society!" The letter also gave her five questions and asked her to answer them in her own handwriting. After hearing this, she was flustered and embarrassed. While muttering, "This little brat, bullying adults," she rummaged through the box for her rusty fountain pen, took out a few sheets of letter paper, asked for my clipboard, and started writing facing the corner of the wall.

　　Three hours passed, and I got off work. As soon as I entered the door, she showed me her reply. It was written neatly enough: Who is the women's leader? She drew two circles. The other questions, Who is the Chairman of the People's Government, When was the Communist Party founded, Where is the capital, were all answered correctly. Only the fifth question, "What is a person who can't read called?" she answered "Your Mom." I couldn't help but laugh. I said, "There are many people who can't read, are you going to let all the children call you Mom? Do you agree?" She chuckled and tore the piece of paper in half. She picked up another piece of paper and asked me, "Help me out! Which two characters are 'Cai Chang'?" I said, "How are you going to answer the fifth question?" "Illiterate! Illiterate!" I said, "How about 'blind as a bat' to be more blunt!"

　　After that, I taught her two characters every day, and she studied them seriously, and she was able to master the four skills (able to read, write, explain, and use). For two days I was busy with work and didn't teach her, and she could still ask others herself. Then she got sick for a few days, and I found her lying on the bed, still tracing the characters on the wall newspaper.

　　Her enthusiasm for learning increased, and I was secretly pleased!

　　After recovering from her illness, I asked her to study again. She criticized me for not teaching her those two days. After accepting her criticism, I proposed to sign a contract: I guarantee to teach her the pronunciation, writing, explanation, and usage of two new characters every day, and she guarantees to learn them diligently. She agreed very much. We stipulated the time and decided to teach from simple to complex. Finally, we each signed the contract.

　　It's been ten days now, and we've both followed the contract, and the results are good. I find that she remembers the characters firmly and writes them clearly, which makes me even more confident in helping her.

　　我和爱人订立“包教保学合同”
    某师政治部  台山
    我的爱人李玉梅同志是一个农民出身的妇女，自从一九四七年到了部队以后，在这几年的锻炼过程中，不论在思想意识上、作风习惯上都有不少的进步；特别是保持了优良的勤俭习惯，学会了保育小孩的科学方法。这些都是我对她敬爱的地方。但她有一个大毛病，就是不爱学习文化。这几年来，在职工学校里始终没有好好学习，到现在勉勉强强能认识三十多个字，会写的过不了一半，有的讲不来，有的用不当。
    今年春天，部队里开展消灭文盲运动，有一天我和她说：“上级要在一年半内消灭文盲，你也得好好学习文化，我天天教你，行吧？”她皱了皱眉头，说：“你给我抱孩子吗？”我说：“你一边抱孩子，一边学文化并不是办不到的事情！”我讲了好多例子，说时间是有的，就是看自己学不学。“我就不学，部队不要我，抱上娃到工厂去，也有办法。”“工厂里也要消灭文盲，工人的学习更紧张！”我又把学文化的好处讲来讲去，但是她的回答是：“记不住，白学。”“你少麻烦，少抓缺点！”“硬逼着老马学窜，谁教你年青时不教我！”……唠叨了大半天。
    生产任务规定后，她就开始做起鞋子来，做的结实、样好。做成一双，同志们要一双，于是她就整天价做，我要是和他一谈学习问题，她就理直气壮地说：“×××字识得多做不来鞋子，×××做出来没人要，你说她们有文化顶啥事？”我正要和她辩论，她夹着鞋底、麻绳、抱上孩子，急忙跑了。
    记得，有几个晚上，我还是与她慢慢地谈，她瞌睡了就应承了，说是第二天开始，但一到天明依然如故！
    四月十四日，大女儿航英从子弟学校里寄来一封信。孩子们天真直爽，提的意见很尖锐，信中说：“妈妈不好好学文化，就是不求进步。出来好几年，过去是说爸不在，没心学习；现在胜利了，跟爸在一起，为什么还不学习？我望妈妈不要落后了，好好学习吧，当一个新社会的妈妈吧！”信上还给她出了五道题，要她亲笔答复。她听了后，手忙脚乱，显得十分地忸怩、难堪。一边嘴里骂着：“这小鬼头，欺负大人了”，一边从箱子里翻出已经生了锈的水笔，拿出几张信纸，要了我的纸夹子，面对墙角写起来。
    三个钟头已过，我下了办公。刚一进门，她就给我看她的回信，写的倒也整齐：妇女领袖是谁，画了两个圈，其余人民政府主席是谁、共产党那一年诞生、首都在那里几题都答对了，惟有第五题“不识字的人叫什么？”答了个“叫你妈”，我由不得大笑了。我说：“不识字的人多的很，都让孩子叫妈，你同不同意？”她噗嗤一声笑了，随手就把那片信纸撕成两半。她又拿起一张信纸问我说：“帮助一下吧！蔡畅是那两个字？”我说：“第五题你打算怎答？”“文盲！文盲！”我说：“不如‘睁眼瞎子’干脆！”
    此后我每天教她两个字，她也认真地学起来，而且能够做到四会（会念、会写、会讲、会用）。有两天我因工作忙，没有教她，她自己还能问问别人。接着病了几天，我发觉她躺在炕上，还描画墙报上的字。
    学习情绪提高了，我暗暗地欢喜！
    病愈后，我又让她学习，她批评我那两天没有教她，我接受后，提出订立一个合同：我包教她每天两个生字的念法、写法、讲法、用法，她保证用心学会。她很同意。我们规定了时间，决定由简而繁的教学。最后各自在合同上签了名。
    现在已经十天了，我们都按照合同办了，成绩良好。我发现她对字记得还踏实，写得也清楚，这使我更有信心帮助她。
