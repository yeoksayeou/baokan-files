　　Defend World Peace, Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons!

　　The Peace Signature Campaign in Wuhan
　　Bai Yun
　　The signature campaign for the defense of world peace in Wuhan has been widely and enthusiastically launched. Of the city's population of more than 1.1 million, over 900,000 have already signed. In the beginning, some comrades felt that China had a high rate of illiteracy and that Chinese people were not accustomed to signing their names, so they were afraid that the campaign would not succeed. However, later facts proved that as long as we carry out in-depth propaganda and create a fervent atmosphere, the masses themselves will create many methods to overcome difficulties.
　　A worker in a school in Hankou could not write, and was very anxious watching others sign. He quickly asked a teacher to write his name for him, and then with a very serious attitude, and sweating profusely, he "drew" it on the paper. Farmers in the suburbs understood the great principle of "peace under heaven," and carefully added their fingerprints below their signatures, solemnly and resolutely. Monks and Taoists wrote their names in circles, symbolizing great unity. Their signature books were made of yellow silk used for writing scriptures, because they knew that striving for the peace and happiness of all mankind was the most sacred thing!
　　Various organizations in Wuhan adopted various methods to promote this movement. In addition to various conference promotions, they also used organized masses to promote to unorganized masses, infiltrating the signature campaign into their daily work. For example, the Municipal Women's Federation used activists to promote the peace movement to women in neighborhoods and streets, and at the same time organized them into the Women's Federation.
　　When the Peace Propaganda Team arrived at a place, they started work in light of the local conditions, and the propaganda upsurge in various places was launched again. After the delegation arrived in Wuhan, various districts held traveling exhibitions of peace signatures, convened various forums and speeches, and even convened mass rallies of tens of thousands of people. Comrade Xiao San, the head of the delegation, the local mayor, and others attended and gave speeches. The conference also sent a telegram "Opposing the American atrocities in suppressing the people's movement," and the upsurge in signatures was once again set off amid the enthusiastic sentiments of the masses.
　　Afterwards, the masses reflected: "This propaganda made us realize the significance of the signature campaign, knowing that China's revolutionary victory has consolidated world peace, and the strength of the world peace camp has also consolidated China's victory. Therefore, defending world peace is defending our own vital interests, and the signature campaign represents the great unity of peace-loving people all over the world. This unified will and strength is a fatal blow to imperialism."
　　A female worker in a yarn factory said: "In the past, we only knew to sign for peace, but we couldn't explain the reason. Now we understand that signing is a determination to oppose aggressive war, a demonstration to the enemy, letting imperialism recognize our strength and dare not attack us."
　　Some workers also said: "I have further realized that our opposition to war is not because we are afraid of war, because the peace movement that is developing all over the world has raised the consciousness of the masses. We are prepared, we are organized, and we have determination."
　　When the women of Wuhan heard how the people in the socialist Soviet Union and other new democratic countries overcame difficulties and created a happy life, they yearned and admired them very much, and strengthened their determination to defend world peace. They demanded that every peace fighter play a greater role in their existing jobs and use actions to defend world peace. Comrades! Let us respond to their call! Show our strength for peace in production, in work, and in study!

　　武汉的和平签名运动
    白芸
    武汉保卫世界和平的签名运动，已经广泛而热烈地开展起来了。在全市一百一十多万人口中，已有九十多万签了名。开始的时候，有部分的工作同志觉得中国文盲很多，中国人又没有签字的习惯，这个运动怕搞不起来，但是后来的事实告诉我们，只要深入宣传，掀起热潮，群众自己就会创造出许多方法来克服困难的。
    汉口一个学校的工友，自己不会写字，看着别人签名，很是着急，赶快请教师帮他写出名字，然后自己用非常严肃的态度，流了满头大汗，照样给“画”上了。郊区的老乡懂得“天下太平”的大道理，在签名下边又仔仔细细地打上手押，郑重而坚决。僧道们把名字写成圆形，象征着大团结，他们的签名册是写经书用的黄色绢绸制成，因为他们知道为全人类的和平幸福而奋斗的事情是最神圣的！
    武汉各团体采用了多种方式推进这一运动，除了各种会议宣传之外，并且通过有组织的群众向无组织的群众宣传，把签名运动渗透在自己日常业务里，例如市妇联通过积极分子向里弄街道妇女宣传和平运动，同时就把她们组织到妇联里来了。
    和平宣传团到达一个地方，就结合当地情况展开工作，各地的宣传热潮得以再次开展。代表团到达武汉后，各区举行了和平签名的巡回展览，召开了各种座谈演讲会，更召开了几万人的群众大会，代表团长萧三同志、当地市长等都出席演讲。大会并发出通电“反对美国镇压人民运动的暴行”，在群情激昂下，签名高潮再次掀起。
    事后群众反映道：“这一次宣传使我们认清了签名运动的意义，知道中国的革命胜利巩固了世界和平，而世界和平阵营的力量也巩固了中国的胜利。因此保卫世界和平就是保卫我们的切身利益，签名运动表示全世界爱好和平人民的大团结。这个统一的意志和力量就是对帝国主义的致命打击。”
    一个纱厂女工说：“过去我们只知道要和平就签名，讲不出什么道理来，现在了解签名就是决心反对侵略战争，就是向敌人示威，叫帝国主义认识我们的力量，不敢来打我们。”
    也有的工人说：“我进一步认识了我们反对战争，并不是害怕战争，因为全世界正在开展的和平运动，提高了群众的觉悟，我们有了准备，有了组织，有了决心。”
    武汉的妇女们听到社会主义的苏联和其他新民主主义国家中，人民怎样克服困难，创造了幸福的生活，她们非常向往羡慕，加强了保卫世界和平的决心，她们要求每一员和平战士，在其现有工作岗位上，发挥更大的积极性，用行动来保卫世界和平。同志们！我们来响应她们的号召吧！在生产、在工作、在学习中表现我们和平的力量！
