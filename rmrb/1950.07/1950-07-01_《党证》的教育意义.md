The Educational Significance of "Party Card"
    Fang Yue

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution, the openly armed enemies were eliminated, but the hidden enemies were still active, constantly attempting to sabotage the Soviet regime and the construction of socialist society. The film "Party Card" gives us a vivid example.

    The reactionary spy, Hurbin, after killing the Communist Youth League shock worker of a collective farm in Siberia, changed his name to Pavel Kuganov, fled to Moscow, and used the most despicable means to deceive the young female Communist Party member Anna into loving him. He then wormed his way into the Party organization under the guise of "active work" to carry out sabotage activities. In order to carry out the instructions of the secret service chief, he stole his newlywed wife's Party card as capital for his counter-revolutionary activities. After the incident of the Party card being stolen was discovered, the factory held a meeting to review it, and Anna was expelled from the Party. But Pavel Kuganov's mask was soon exposed, revealing the true face of a spy. He was finally arrested and imprisoned, and was sanctioned by Soviet law.

    In this film, we see all kinds of faces of counter-revolutionaries. He pretends to be active, gains the trust of the organization, and establishes prestige among the masses to cover up his conspiracies. When the mask is exposed, he puts on a very pitiful appearance, trying to win people's sympathy. "Joining the Party, getting married, working" were the despicable means used by the spy Kuganov to probe into Soviet national defense military secrets. But in front of a proletarian party with a strict organization and rich struggle experience, he finally revealed his true colors.

    This film tells us that the enemy is always watching for the weaknesses of the revolutionary ranks and using these weaknesses. Every Communist Party member, every revolutionary, must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, and must not slack off in the slightest. The young Communist Party member Anna was actually deceived by Kuganov's sweet words and fell for Kuganov's trick, leading him into the Party and even having her own Party card stolen by him. As a result, she not only lost her Party membership, but also almost caused serious damage to the Party and the country. This is a great lesson!

    This lesson has great educational significance for our country's Communist Party members and all revolutionary elements. We are in a situation of basic victory of the revolution. The remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, are still making a last-ditch struggle and still want to use special agents to undermine our revolutionary achievements and sabotage our construction cause. We must be vigilant in our daily life and work, especially Communist Party members.

    Welcome to the screening of "Party Card" on the 29th anniversary of our Party. We hope that every comrade who has watched "Party Card" will bring the education it gives us into the actual life struggle.

　　《党证》的教育意义
    方约
    俄国十月革命胜利之后，公开武装的敌人是被消灭了，但暗藏的敌人仍在活动，时刻企图破坏苏维埃政权和社会主义社会的建设。影片《党证》给了我们一个活生生的例子。
    反动派的间谍休宾，在杀害西伯利亚集体农庄共青团突击队员之后，改名帕维尔·库甘诺夫，逃到莫斯科，以最卑鄙的手段骗取了青年女共产党员安娜的爱情，又以“积极工作”的姿态钻进了党的组织，进行暗害活动。为了执行特务头子的指示，他把新婚妻子的党证偷了出来，作为反革命活动的资本。党证被窃的事件发现后，工厂开会检讨，安娜被开除了党籍。而帕维尔·库甘诺夫的假面具不久也被揭穿了，露出了间谍的真面目。他终于被捕入狱，受到了苏维埃法律的制裁。
    在这个影片中，我们看到反革命分子的各种各样的面貌。他装出积极的样子，取得组织的信任，在群众中建立威信，以掩盖其阴谋诡计。等到假面具被揭穿了，他又做出十分可怜的样子，企图博得人们的怜悯。“入党、结婚、工作”就是间谍库甘诺夫用以刺探苏联国防军事秘密的卑鄙手段。但在一个有严密组织、有丰富斗争经验的无产阶级政党面前，他终于显现了原形。
    这部影片告诉我们：敌人随时随地窥伺着革命队伍的弱点，利用这些弱点。每一个共产党员，每一个革命分子，必须时刻保持高度的警惕性，一丝一毫都不能松懈。年青的共产党员安娜竟被库甘诺夫的甜言蜜语所诱骗，上了库甘诺夫的当，把他引到党内来，连自己的党证都被他偷去了。结果她非但自己失去了党籍，而且差点儿给党和国家招致了严重的损害。这是一个绝大的教训！
    这个教训，对于我国的共产党员，对于我国的一切革命分子，都有重大的教育意义。我们正处在革命基本胜利的情况下，国民党反动派的残余，在美国帝国主义的扶持下，还在作垂死挣扎，还想利用特务来破坏我们的革命成果，暗害我们的建设事业。我们在日常生活和日常工作中都要提高警惕，特别是共产党员。
    欢迎《党证》在我们党的二十九周年放映，希望看了《党证》的每一个同志，把它所给予我们的教育带到实际的生活斗争中去。
