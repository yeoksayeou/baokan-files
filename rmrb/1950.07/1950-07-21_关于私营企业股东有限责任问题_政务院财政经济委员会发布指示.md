Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council issued the following "Instructions on the Issue of Limited Liability for Shareholders of Private Enterprises" on the 15th:

　　Recently, local people's governments have reported that the business community hopes that the Central People's Government will promulgate the Company Law or Investment Regulations as soon as possible to determine the rights and responsibilities of investors. At the Third Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in Shanghai, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce also specifically put forward this proposal in its report, stating that shareholders with limited liability in private enterprises are deeply concerned that they will bear unlimited liability if the enterprises in which they invest fail. Therefore, they hope that the Central People's Government will give instructions on this issue to relieve investors' concerns.

　　In order to protect industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, encourage their enthusiasm for operation, and support their development, the Central People's Government is vigorously carrying out various work to rationally adjust industries and businesses. The Company Law or Investment Regulations are also being drafted. Now, the following two measures are proposed as guidelines for local people's governments to handle the issue of limited liability for shareholders of private enterprises:

　　(1) For private enterprises that have completed registration and been approved by the local government, shareholders with limited liability shall pay up their subscribed capital in accordance with the enterprise's articles of association. The capital liability they bear when the enterprise suffers operating losses shall also be limited to the amount of capital they have subscribed.

　　(2) If directors, managers, or other agents of private enterprises who are in charge of business operations engage in illegal operations, commit fraud, or pursue private interests, resulting in the bankruptcy of the company, they shall bear legal responsibility.

　　关于私营企业股东有限责任问题
    政务院财政经济委员会发布指示
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于十五日发布“关于私营企业股东有限责任问题的指示”如下：
    近据各地人民政府报告，工商界都盼望中央人民政府早日颁布公司法或投资条例，以确定投资人的权利与责任。上海市第三届各界人民代表会议举行时，上海市工商业联合会筹备会的报告中亦特别提出此项建议，述及私营企业中有限责任股东深恐在其投资之企业经营失败时要负无限责任，所以希望中央人民政府对此有所指示，以解除投资者的顾虑。
    中央人民政府为了保护有利于国计民生的工商业，鼓励其经营的积极性并扶助其发展，正在大力进行合理调整工商业的各种工作，公司法或投资条例亦正在起草中。现在先提出下列两项办法，作为各地人民政府处理私营企业股东有限责任问题的方针：
    （一）私营企业凡已向地方政府办理登记经核准者，其有限责任之股东，应依该企业之章程，缴清其所认之股款；在该企业经营亏损时所负资金之责任，亦以其认缴之股款为限。
    （二）私营企业中执行业务之董事、经理人或其他代理执行人，若有非法经营、舞弊营私而使公司破产者，应负法律责任。
