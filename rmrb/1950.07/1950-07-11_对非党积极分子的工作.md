　　Work with Non-Party Activists
    By Atroshenko (Soviet Union)

    Every time, when summarizing the work of enterprises, grassroots party organizations always point out progress with a sense of pride. This progress is reflected in the percentage exceeding the plan and the percentage of excellent products, in the savings of millions of rubles, and in the proper movement of working capital. But in addition to this, party organizations also see living people. These are Stakhanovite workers, for whom the interests of the enterprise are closely related. These are the creators of innovation, who propose thousands of rationalization proposals every year. This is the entire staff of the enterprise, everyone striving forward, making progress, working more consciously, and participating in socialist construction. Here, the achievements of the factory party organization are particularly evident.

    In this large collective, there are not many communists. They are the advanced elements, carrying out tremendous work. But without a doubt, if the party organization did not have countless non-party activists, it would be impossible to connect with every worker in the factory. Stalin said: "The strength of the Bolsheviks, the strength of the Communist Party, lies in their ability to unite millions of non-party activists around our party." This is especially clear in practical work. Non-party activists are not only a bridge connecting the party and the masses, but also a rich treasure trove from which the Bolshevik Party draws new strength.

    Due to the victory of socialism in Russia, the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people has been realized and consolidated. The base and reserves of non-party activists have also been greatly expanded. But one should never conclude from this that party organizations need not be so concerned about cultivating non-party activists. The lofty task of communist proposals requires party organizations to further improve the level of organizational and political work among the masses. The work of cultivating and educating non-party activists occupies an important place in the activities of party organizations.

    An activist is not just someone who sympathizes with the party; every Soviet person sympathizes with the party's measures. We are talking about people who regularly and actively assist in the practical work of the party organization. These activists emerge in the process of fighting to complete the current practical tasks of the factory and the party organization. The more the party organization confidently entrusts important work to non-party people, and the more actively it absorbs the staff in the enterprise to participate in its daily work, the greater the number of activists and the faster their quality improves.

    It is a mistake to limit the circle of activists to the selected staff of the trade union and the Communist Youth League organizations. Party organizations should directly assign tasks to hundreds of staff members in the factory. More than one-third of the propagandists who work in production teams, workshops, and dormitories are non-party engineers, technicians, workers, and clerks. They value the trust of the party organization, help educate the masses, organize the masses, and solve current tasks, and they themselves are growing rapidly in this glorious work.

    Stalin taught us that communists should treat non-party members as equals. Communists must not close themselves in the shell of the party and become arrogant because of their party membership. They should humbly listen to the opinions of non-party members, not only educate non-party members, but also learn from them. Stalin said that the issue of the relationship between party members and non-party members is the most important practical issue for our party. Lenin used the word "mutual trust" to define this relationship.

    When solving all tasks, party organizations must consult with non-party members and attract them to discuss issues. When the party organization was faced with the task of making our factory profitable, it called on hundreds of people to solve this problem together. More than two thousand non-party members attended the meeting to prepare and hold a discussion among activists on how the factory could make a profit. Many of them made speeches and put forward concrete suggestions at the discussion.

    The suggestions and organizational technical measures put forward at this meeting were all implemented.

    But the important thing is another aspect: seeing the trust of the party organization, and its efforts to value and implement all valuable suggestions, non-party workers have become more and more firm in their faith in the party organization, and have extended a helping hand to the party in everything.

    Open party meetings are of great significance in the work with non-party activists. This can also be seen in practice. The work of the technical department was reviewed at an open party meeting in a mechanical factory. This issue was raised because the production plan of the workshop had changed, and the plan could not be completed if the technical process was not urgently transformed. The meeting criticized the bad style of the technical department staff: they locked themselves in the office, only talking without connecting with practice. Non-party workers, engineers, and technicians saw how intensely this important production problem was being discussed, and they also participated in the open discussion. The party meeting adopted the opinions of non-party comrades and passed detailed regulations. Isn't this enough to inspire people and increase their enthusiasm? In addition, by attending party meetings, non-party activists can understand the attitude of the party and the state in handling practical affairs and broaden their horizons. Of course, not all party meetings can be held openly, but the factory party organization should hold as many open meetings as possible, and never close itself in a hard shell.

    The number of non-party activists is constantly increasing. There are various ways to attract people to participate in social work. However, the most important of these is individual work. The communists in the factory live with workers, engineering and technical workers, and clerks day and night. Among them, they have discovered capable and talented people, and they constantly absorb them to participate in active work. For example, the planer worker Riyadov was originally unnoticed in the factory. The propagandist's forum on rapid labor made him determined to become a rapid worker. He applied new planing methods and increased output by more than two times. The factory's party organization asked Riyadov to teach his working methods to other workers. He gladly accepted this request. Later, the party often gave him things to do. Now Riyadov often participates in forums and has become an active propagandist.

    From this example, we can see how to find new forces to fill the ranks of non-party activists. In the course of socialist competition, in the work of trade unions and the Communist Youth League, a large number of such activists have emerged. Helping them in time when they need it, giving them advice, supporting them, gently pointing out mistakes, from ordinary commissions to fairly complex tasks - these are the unshirkable responsibilities of the party organization.

    But activists do not only learn and be educated in practical work. Party organizations pay great attention to expanding the horizons of non-party activists and improving their Marxist-Leninist understanding. Non-party workers, engineers, technicians, and communists equally possess all possibilities for studying in the party's education system. In this academic year, more than two hundred non-party employees went to political schools to study. Party organizations help the "House of Technology" and the Science and Technology Association to expand their work, promote the education of our technical intellectuals, and absorb them to actively participate in social work.

    This kind of work with activists has greatly increased the party organization's influence on the factory's entire workforce and enterprise activities. At the same time, it has discovered many capable talents among non-party workers and experts, enabling them to hold responsible positions in social groups and do important work.

    The work with non-party activists is also of great significance for the growth of the party's ranks. As everyone knows, our party has not actively expanded its ranks in recent years, and it has focused on the education of party members. Of course, this does not mean stopping the absorption of party members. It's just that the requirements for communists and newly admitted comrades have been raised. However, some party workers in the factory have raised the question: can we generally accept new people into the party now? The facts answered this question: the continuous growth of non-party activists shows that many people in the factory have close ties with the party organization, and they can meet the high requirements put forward today for newly admitted comrades.

    Studying with communists, participating in social work together, they grow up politically, get used to working with others, gradually become integrated with the life of the party organization, and eventually have to join the ranks of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). And the party organization has studied them well. Only in this way can we truly implement Stalin's instructions: "Non-party activists are the medium through which the party survives and develops."

### 对非党积极分子的工作

　　对非党积极分子的工作
    苏联  阿特罗申柯作
    每一次，当总结企业工作的时候，基层的党组织总是怀着足以自豪的心情指出了进步。这进步表现在超过计划的百分比和优良产品的百分比中，在节约几百万卢布中，在流动资金的妥善运动中。但党组织在这以外还看到了活生生的人。这是斯塔汉诺夫运动者，企业的利益对他们是切身攸关的。这是推陈出新的创造者，他们一年内提出几千件的合理化建议。这是企业的全体工作人员，每个人都努力向前，上进，日益自觉地工作，参加社会主义的建设。在这里，工厂党组织的工作成绩是特别明显的。
    在这个大集体中，共产党员并不怎么多。他们是先进者，进行着巨大的工作。但毫无疑问的，如果党组织没有无数的非党积极分子，则它是无法跟工厂的每个工人接触的。斯大林说过：“布尔什维克的力量，共产党的力量，就在他们善于把几百万非党积极分子团结在我党的周围，”——这在实际工作上表现得尤其清楚。非党的积极分子不仅是联系党和群众的桥梁，而且是一个最丰富的宝藏，布尔什维克党就从那里汲取新的力量。
    由于社会主义在俄国的胜利，苏维埃人民的精神和政治的团结是实现并巩固了。非党积极分子的基地和储备也无比地扩大了。但决不能因此得出结论，以为党组织对非党积极分子的培养不必那么操心了。共产主义建议的崇高任务，要求党的组织更加提高对群众的组织工作和政治工作的水准。培养、教育非党积极分子的工作在党组织的活动中占着重要的地位。
    积极分子，不仅是同情党的人；每一个苏维埃人都同情党的措施的。这里所说的是这样的一种人，他们经常地并且积极地协助着党组织的实际工作。这种积极分子是在为完成工厂和党组织当前实际任务而斗争的过程中产生出来的，党组织愈是放心把重要工作交给非党的人去做，愈积极地吸收企业中的工作人员来参加自己的日常工作，积极分子的数量就愈多，他们的质素也提高得愈快。
    把积极分子的圈子仅限于挑选出来的职工会和共产主义青年团组织的工作人员，是一个错误。党组织应该把任务直接交给工厂中的几百个工作人员。在生产班、车间、宿舍中进行工作的鼓动家，三分之一以上是非党的工程师、技术员、工人和办事员。他们看重党组织的付托，协助教育群众，组织群众，解决当前的任务，而自己也在这一光荣的工作中迅速成长着。
    斯大林教导我们，共产党员应该以平等的态度对待非党员。共产党员不能把自己关闭在党的硬壳中，以自己的党籍而自大。他们应该虚心倾听非党员的意见，不但要教育非党员，而且要向他们学习。斯大林说，党员和非党员间相互关系的问题，是我党最重要的一个实践问题。列宁拿“互信”两个字确定了这种相互关系。
    在解决一切任务时，党组织要和非党员商量，吸引他们来研讨问题。当党组织面临着我们的工厂应做到获利这一任务时，他号召了几百个人一同来解决这个问题。在准备和举行积极分子讨论工厂用什么方法才能获利的会议时，参加会的非党员在二千人以上。他们之中的许多人发表演说，并在讨论会上提出具体建议。
    在这次会议上提出来的建议和组织技术的措施，都一一执行了。
    但重要的是另外一方面：看到党组织的信任，以及它重视和实行一切有价值的建议的努力，非党的工人们就愈益坚定了对党组织的信仰，在一切事情中都对党伸出援助之手了。
    党的公开集会，在对非党积极分子的工作中，有着重要意义。这也可在实践中看出。在机械工厂的公开的党的会议上检讨了技术室的工作。这个问题的提出，是为了车间的生产计划有了变动，如果技术过程不加以紧急的改造，计划就不能完成。会上指摘了技术室工作人员的不良作风：他们把自己关在办公室里，尽在那里高谈阔论而不和实践联系起来。非党的工人、工程师、技术员看到这个重要的生产问题是如何紧张地讨论着，自己也来参加公开的讨论了。党会议就采纳了非党同志的意见，通过了详细的规定。难道这还不足以鼓舞人们，提高他们的积极性么？此外，到了党的会议上，非党的积极分子就能了解党和国家处理实际事务的态度，扩大自己的视野。当然，并非所有党的集会都可以公开举行的，不过工厂的党组织应该尽可能多多公开举行，而决不要把自己关在硬壳里。
    非党积极分子的数量不断增加着。吸引人们参加社会工作的方法是各不相同的。不过其中最重要的，则是个别的工作。工厂中的共产党员，和工人、工程技术工作者、办事员朝夕相处，在他们中间曾发现有能力有才干的人，而经常吸收他们来参加积极的工作。例如，削截工人里雅陀夫本来在工厂里是不受人注意的。鼓动家关于快速劳动方面的座谈会使他立志做一个快速工作者。他应用新的削截方法，把产量提高了两倍多。工厂的党组织请里雅陀夫把自己的工作方法教给别的工人们。他高兴地接受了这一请求。以后党就经常把事情交给他做。现在里雅陀夫是常常参加座谈会，成为积极的鼓动家了。
    从这个例子可以看到，怎样去找新力量来充实非党积极分子。在社会主义竞赛的进行中，在职工会和共产主义青年团的工作中，大量出现了这种积极分子。在他们需要时及时地帮助他们，给他们忠告，支持他们，婉转地指出错误，从普通的委托给相当复杂的任务——这些是党组织义不容辞的职责。
    但是积极分子不单在实际工作中学习和受教育。党组织对于扩大非党积极分子的眼界，提高他们的马列主义认识，是非常注意的。非党的工人、工程师、技术员和共产党员一律平等地拥有在党的教育体系中学习的一切可能。本学年内，就有二百多个非党员工到政治学校去学习。党组织帮助“技术之家”和科学技术协会展开工作，推进我们的技术知识分子的教育，吸收他们积极参加社会工作。
    这种对积极分子的工作大大地提高了党组织对工厂全体工人以及企业活动的影响。同时它在非党的工人和专家中发现了许多干练的人才，使他们在社会团体中担任负责的职务，做重要的工作。
    对非党积极分子的工作，对于党的队伍的壮大也有着重大的意义。大家知道，我党近年来并未积极扩展自己的队伍，它所着重的是党员的教育。当然，这意思并非停止吸收党员。只是对共产党员，对新入党的同志们的要求提高了，然而，工厂中某些党的工作同志提出了问题：现在可否普遍接受新人入党。对于这一问题。事实作了答复：非党积极分子的不断增长显示，工厂中有许多人已和党组织紧密联系，他们可以满足今天向新入党的同志们提出的高度要求了。
    和共产党员一同学习，共同参加社会工作，他们在政治上成长起来，习惯了和别人一起工作，渐渐地和党组织的生活打成一片，终至非加入联共（布）党的队伍不可。而党组织已经好好地研究过他们了。只有这样才能真正执行斯大林的指示：“非党积极分子是这样的一种媒介，党是靠着它的精华而生存和发展的。”
