To the Editor:

　　I work in the Liaodong Provincial Department of Industry. This time when I returned home (Xiangdao Village, Sixth District, Leting), I discovered a problem. There are probably fourteen or thirteen party members in our village branch, of which nearly half are probationary members. The branch meeting has not been held for four months. The branch has failed to strengthen education for new party members in a timely manner, and most party members cannot play their due role. Embezzlement problems have occurred repeatedly in the village, and most party members know about it, but branch secretary Lu Fengji has never convened a branch meeting to discuss it. I have raised opinions with Zeng Xianquan (Organization Committee Member) and also discussed it with the branch secretary once, but the branch secretary thought that this kind of thing had a history and was not important. I also wrote a letter to Wang Bingyi, the responsible comrade of the Sixth District, asking him to deal with this issue as soon as possible, but no one from the district came to investigate the situation, and my letter was like a stone sinking into the sea.

　　The masses have many opinions on the work and work style of the cadres in the village, but if they raise opinions to the village, not only will the problems not be solved, but they will also be labeled as "saboteurs"; it is even more impossible for the masses to raise opinions to the district, because: every time the district leaders come, they only look for party members and have never approached the masses once. The district chief and the district party secretary sit in the district office and listen to the reports of the party member cadres from each village. They think that with so many party members in the village, how could the work be done badly? When they occasionally hear the masses talking behind their backs, not only do they not delve into the truth, but they say that the masses are backward in their thinking and take them to the county government for education, which makes the masses afraid to speak. This time when I returned home, the masses crowded my house, and everyone asked me about the situation in the villages in Northeast China. I told them about the situation in which the farmers in the Northeast are engaged in production and managing the country as masters of their own affairs. Everyone asked why this village is not like the Northeast. They asked me if I was a party member and what party members do. After I told them about the tasks of the Communist Party, everyone said: Our party members are not like that here. They are only energetic when doing things that benefit them personally; if there is no benefit, they do not move at all. I feel that these problems are serious. I hope that the Leting County Committee will send cadres who can listen to the opinions of the masses to go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and solve the problems in a timely manner.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Liaodong Provincial Department of Industry Zeng Bin

　　Editor's Note: According to Comrade Zeng Bin's letter, the party work in the Sixth District of Leting and the Xiangdao Village of that district is seriously divorced from the masses. The masses have many opinions on the work and work style of the cadres in the village. The branch should absorb these opinions well, improve its work, and educate party members. Some of the opinions of the masses may be incorrect, so they should be explained clearly to the masses. It is an extremely bad style to ignore the opinions of the masses, indiscriminately label them, and even take them to the county government at will. In this way, the party's work will lose its prestige and be divorced from the masses, and party members will not be able to progress. It is hoped that the Tangshan Prefectural Committee and the Leting County Committee will investigate and deal with the situation in the Sixth District and Xiangdao Village, and publish the results of the handling in this newspaper.

### 应检查乐亭香道庄支部的工作

　　应检查乐亭香道庄支部的工作编辑同志：
    我在辽东省工业厅工作。这次回家（乐亭六区香道庄）发现一个问题。我村支部中大概有十四名或者十三名党员，其中将近半数是候补党员。四个月未开支部会。支部对新党员未能及时加强教育，党员多不能起到应有的作用。村中屡次发生贪污问题，党员大多数知道，但支部书记陆凤计未曾召集支部大会研究过一次。我曾和曾宪权（组织委员）提过意见，也曾找支书研究过一次，但支书以为此种事情有历史了、不关重要了。我也曾给六区负责同志王炳一写了一封信，要求尽速处理这个问题，但区里并未来过一人调查情况，我的信有如石沉大海了。
    群众对村里工作及干部作风意见很多，但若向村中提意见，不但不能给解决问题，并且扣上一个“破坏分子”的帽子；群众要向区里提则更不可能，原因是：区负责人一来，就找党员，未和群众接近过一次。区长和区委书记则是坐在区公所听取每村党员干部的汇报。他们以为村中有这么多的党员，工作还会搞坏？他们间或听见群众背地议论时，不但不深入了解真相，反说群众思想落后，带到县府教育教育，使得群众有话不敢讲了。我这次回家，群众挤满了我的屋子，大家问我，东北的乡村情形，我就以东北农民以主人翁的身份进行生产及管理国家的情况告诉他们。大家问为什么这个村不象东北呢？他们问我是不是党员，问党员是干什么的？我把共产党的任务讲给他们听后，大家说：我们这里党员可不是这样，对党员个人有利益的事，他们干着才有劲；如要没有利益，他们都不动。我感到这些问题是严重的，希望乐亭县委指派能听取群众意见的干部深入下层了解情况，及时解决问题。
                                 辽东省工业厅  曾彬
    编者按：根据曾彬同志来信所说，乐亭六区及该区香道庄党的工作，严重地脱离了群众。群众对村里工作及干部作风意见很多，支部应该很好的吸收这些意见改进工作，教育党员。群众意见可能有不对的，则应很好的向群众解释说明清楚。对群众意见采取不理，乱扣帽子，甚至随便带到县府，这是极恶劣的作风。这样，就会使党的工作在群众中丧失威信和脱离群众，党员也就无法进步。希望唐山地委及乐亭县委对六区及香道庄情况进行调查处理，并将处理结果在本报公布。
