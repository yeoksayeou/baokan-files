　　Youth League Youth Service Department
    Organizes Peace Signature Propaganda Team to Depart for Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Line to Carry Out Work
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In response to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Youth Service Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has organized a peace signature propaganda team. On the morning of July 1st, the team departed for various towns along the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway line, including Nankou, Kangzhuang, Xuanhua, and Zhangjiakou, as well as nearby rural areas, to launch a peace signature campaign in coordination with local Communist Youth League organizations and related groups. The main targets of the propaganda work will be farmers and unorganized urban masses. The propaganda will adopt various lively forms, depending on the specific local conditions, including films, street dramas, waist drums, picture exhibitions, photo exhibitions, speeches, and crosstalk. Signature methods: those who can write will sign themselves; those who cannot write can have someone else sign on their behalf, or they can draw a circle symbolizing the unity of the forces of peace to replace the signature.
    The Youth Service Department held a farewell party to send off all the team members. Qu Yuan, Secretary of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, attended the meeting and gave a speech.
