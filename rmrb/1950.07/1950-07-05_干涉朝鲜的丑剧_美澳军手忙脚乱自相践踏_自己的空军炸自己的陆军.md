(Xinhua News Agency, 4th) The Australian Air Force and the American Army, which rushed to the Korean front in a panic, staged a farce of self-trampling from the very beginning. According to reports from the United Press and Associated Press: The U.S. Army, on the 3rd, took trains and trucks north, attempting to save the collapse of Syngman Rhee's army's Suwon defense line. On the same day, the Australian Air Force also made its first sortie to the front. When several Australian aircraft flew over the U.S. military vehicles, they panicked, mistook them for the Korean People's Army, and, without careful identification, frantically bombed and strafed them for as long as twenty-five minutes. It is claimed that one American soldier was injured, two Syngman Rhee puppet soldiers were killed, and the Syngman Rhee artillery school, concentrated trucks, and a train station were destroyed at the same time. According to UPI reporter Carey Shear, who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident, he saw dozens of trucks carrying wounded Syngman Rhee puppet soldiers heading south. Slightly injured soldiers, with bloody bandages, walked forward. They made their way along the road among the smoking trucks. A train loaded with ammunition was exploding violently after being attacked by Australian aircraft, the train station was on fire, and smoke filled the sky over the town.

According to the reporter, the U.S. Air Force also trampled on the U.S. Army. A U.S. Army jeep was strafed by two U.S. jet fighters twenty miles south of Suwon.

　　干涉朝鲜的丑剧
    美澳军手忙脚乱自相践踏         
    自己的空军炸自己的陆军
    【新华社四日讯】仓皇失措赶赴朝鲜前线作战的澳国空军和美国陆军，一开头就演出了自相践踏的丑剧。据合众社与美联社报道：美国陆军于三日乘火车和大卡车北开，企图挽救李承晚军队水原防线的崩溃。同日，澳国空军亦首次向前线出动。当澳国飞机数架飞临美军车辆上空时，心慌意乱，以为是朝鲜人民军，不及细辨，即慌张地猛烈轰炸射击，共达二十五分钟之久。据称，有一名美国兵受伤，两名李承晚伪军被击毙，同时炸毁了李承晚的炮兵学校和集中在一起的大卡车及一个火车站。据出事后不久到达肇事地点的合众社记者卡里·歇尔称，他看到好几十辆大卡车装着受伤的李承晚伪军士兵向南驶去。伤势不重的士兵包扎着血污的绷带步行前进。他们沿着公路在冒着烟的大卡车中间找路走。一列装运军火的火车在遭受澳机袭击后正在猛烈爆炸，火车站正在燃烧，城镇上空弥漫着浓烟。
    据该记者称，美国空军也和美国陆军自行践踏。一辆美军吉普车在水原以南二十英里曾遭到两架美国喷气飞机的扫射。
