Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. The Central Committees of the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions and the North Korean Women's League, on July 1st, sent telegrams to the World Federation of Trade Unions in Paris and the International Democratic Women's Federation, respectively, requesting that they promptly discuss and take all possible measures to support the issue of American imperialism instigating the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang to launch a civil war, massacre the people, and directly conduct armed intervention in Korean internal affairs. The North Korean Youth League also sent a similar telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

The telegram from the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions stated: "Following the instigation of the Li Chengwan bandit gang by American imperialism to launch a civil war on June 25th, Truman immediately ordered MacArthur on June 27th to deploy American naval and air forces to directly intervene in Korean internal affairs with armed force. On June 30th, Truman again ordered the dispatch of American ground forces to participate in the war. From the first day of the outbreak of the civil war, the American naval and air forces bombed the peaceful residents of our motherland's cities and villages.

The Korean working class, together with the people of the entire country, will never yield to any armed aggression by the American imperialists. For the complete liberation and independent freedom of our motherland, we will fight to the end. The Central Committee of the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions requests the World Federation of Trade Unions to take all possible countermeasures against the American imperialists' illegal and brutal acts of armed intervention in Korean internal affairs, and to organize brotherly trade unions in all countries of the world to launch protest movements against the American imperialists' acts of aggression."

The North Korean Democratic Women's League stated in its telegram: "For their greedy aggressive purposes, the American imperialists are dropping bombs on our innocent children, mothers, and the elderly. Blood has stained our beautiful mountains and rivers. Korean women, who love peace, oppose war, and value the independent freedom of their motherland more than their own lives, have reached the extreme of anger towards American imperialism and its running dogs. We have full confidence and certainty to drive the ferocious aggressors out of our motherland's territory."

　　北朝鲜人民团体电世界工联等
    要求制止美帝侵略
    【新华社平壤三日电】北朝鲜职业总同盟与北朝鲜妇女同盟中央委员会，于七月一日分别致电巴黎世界工会联合会与国际民主妇女联合会，要求他们对美帝国主义指使李承晚匪帮发动内战，屠杀人民并直接对朝鲜内政进行武装干涉一事，迅速予以讨论，并采取一切可能的办法，予以声援。北朝鲜青年联盟亦向世界青年联盟发出同样的电报。
    北朝鲜职业总同盟的电文称：“继六月二十五日美帝国主义嗾使李承晚匪帮发动内战之后，杜鲁门即于二十七日命令麦克阿瑟出动美海空军直接武装干涉朝鲜内政。六月三十日，杜鲁门又下令派遣美陆军参战。自内战发动的头一天起，美国的海空军即轰炸了我祖国城市和乡村的和平居民。
    朝鲜工人阶级与全国人民一起，决不屈服于美帝国主义者的任何武装侵略，我们为了祖国的完全解放和独立自由，要战斗到底。北朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会要求世界工会联合会对美帝国主义非法以武力干涉朝鲜内政的野兽暴行，采取一切可能的对策，并组织世界各国的兄弟工会对美帝国主义的侵略行为展开抗议运动。”
    北朝鲜民主妇女同盟在电文中说：“美帝国主义者为了其贪婪的侵略目的，把炸弹扔在我们无辜的孩子、母亲和老人的头上，鲜血染红了我们美丽的山河，热爱和平、反对战争、把祖国的独立自由看得比自己的生命还宝贵的朝鲜妇女，对美帝国主义及其走狗的愤恨已达极点，我们有充分的把握和信心把凶恶的侵略者从我祖国的疆土上驱逐出去。”
