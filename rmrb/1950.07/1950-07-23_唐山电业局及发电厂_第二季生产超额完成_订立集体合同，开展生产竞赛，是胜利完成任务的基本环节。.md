　　Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant
    Second Quarter Production Exceeds Quota
    Signing Collective Contracts and Launching Production Emulation Drives are Fundamental Links in Successfully Completing Tasks
    [Our Tangshan Dispatch] The Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant completely overfulfilled their second-quarter production tasks. Power generation output increased from 19,000 KW to 21,000 KW, increasing the power generation capacity of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid. The total electricity generated for the quarter exceeded the planned quota by 14.92 percent. Electricity sales exceeded the planned quota by 28.12 percent. Average coal consumption was 0.579 (0.577 for May and June), a decrease of 0.001 compared to the planned quota. Plant electricity consumption decreased from the planned quota of 5.22 percent to 4.92 percent. Line losses decreased from the planned quota of 6.35 percent to 1.19 percent. Due to increased electricity sales and reduced consumption, costs also decreased from the planned quota of 0.376 jin of millet per kilowatt-hour to 0.273 jin. Tangshan Electric has created brilliant achievements in people's electric power production.
    These achievements were made in the May-June production, economy, safety, and model-creation emulation campaign, and in the implementation of an advanced production system – the collective contract.
    On May 15th, the employees and administration of Tangshan Electric signed a collective contract for power generation and supply. The contract clearly stipulated the production tasks and the specific responsibilities of both parties to ensure the completion of the production tasks, and stipulated the measures to reward employees and improve their material and cultural life based on the completion of the tasks. Through the contract, a division of labor responsibility system was established for warehouse management, shift handover rules, operation, and maintenance, strengthening the sense of responsibility of employees; a production self-review system was established. Each unit, in the form of mutual aid groups and in the spirit of mutual assistance, launched criticism and self-criticism targeting shortcomings in ideology, work, and study; at the same time, technical crash courses were established to improve the technical and theoretical level of employees. As a result, all employees, under the clear policy of "safe power generation, reduced costs," worked together to complete and exceed the production tasks.
    The collective contract, combined with the production emulation drive, further stimulated the enthusiasm and initiative of employees, strengthened the planning of work, and implemented the responsibility system. During the one-and-a-half-month contract period, not only were the production tasks completed and exceeded, but there was not a single accident due to negligence. All employees, in their work, demonstrated the spirit of being masters of their own house to manage their own factory, and were very concerned about the loss and waste of even a piece of coal or a drop of water. Every corner of the plant, every person, was closely related and became an organic whole, all thinking of ways and offering ideas to reduce coal consumption. Employees constantly strived to improve technology, and gained certain understanding and preliminary experience regarding the size of the wind, the thickness of the coal, the amount of water contained in the coal, the operation of the air dampers, the water supply temperature, the rise and fall of the load, and the dispatch and distribution of the economic load.
    Based on the existing achievements, all employees of Tangshan Electric are now continuing to work hard to ensure long-term safe power generation and strive to complete the annual electricity sales task before the October Revolution Day. (Wang Chengzong, Zhang Yucen)

　　唐山电业局及发电厂
    第二季生产超额完成
    订立集体合同，开展生产竞赛，是胜利完成任务的基本环节。
    【本报唐山讯】唐山电业局、发电厂第二季度生产任务全部超额完成。发电出力由一九、○○○ＫＷ，提高至二一、○○○ＫＷ，为京津唐电力网增加了发电能力。全季发电度数超过计划定额百分之十四点九二。售电量超过计划定额百分之二十八点一二。煤耗平均为○点五七九（五、六月份均为○点五七七），较计划定额减少○点○○一。厂用电由计划定额的百分之五点二二降为百分之四点九二。线路损失由计划定额的百分之六点三五降为百分之一点一九。由于售电量增加和耗损减少，成本也随之由计划定额的○点三七六斤小米（每度）降为○点二七三斤。唐电给人民电业生产创造了光辉的成绩。
    这些成绩是在、六月生产节约安全创模竞赛运动中，在实行先进的生产制度——集体合同——中做出来的。
    唐电职工与行政在五月十五日签订了发电供电集体合同。合同中明确规定了生产任务和双方保证完成生产任务的具体职责，规定了在完成任务的基础上给予职工以奖励和改善职工物质文化生活的措施。通过合同，建立了仓库管理、交接班规则、运行及维护等分工负责制，加强了职工的责任心；建立了生产自我检讨制度。各单位以互助小组的形式，以互助的精神，针对思想、工作和学习中的缺点，展开批评和自我批评；同时建立技术速成训练班，提高职工技术理论水平。于是全体职工在“安全发电、减低成本”的明确方针下，一致努力，完成和超过了生产任务。
    集体合同结合着生产竞赛，就进一步鼓动起职工的积极性和主动性，加强了工作的计划性，贯彻了负责制度。在一个半月的合同期限里，不仅完成和超过了生产任务，而且没有发生一次责任事故。全体职工在工作中拿出当家做主人的气魄，来管理自己的工厂，就是对一块煤、一滴水卡热的损失浪费，都十分关心。全厂每一个角落，每一个人都休戚相关，成为一个有机的整体，都在为减低煤耗想办法、出主意。职工们不断努力改进技术，关于风的大小，煤的厚薄，煤内含水的多少，风门的操作，给水温度，负荷的涨落，经济负荷的调度分配，都摸到了一定的规律，取得了初步经验。
    唐电全体职工在已有的成绩的基础上，现正继续努力，保证长期安全发电，并争取全年售电任务在十月革命节前完成。（王承宗、张玉忱）
