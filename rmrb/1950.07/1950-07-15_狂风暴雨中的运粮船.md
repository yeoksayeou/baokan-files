　　Grain Transport Boat in a Storm
    Mu Ren
    At the mouth of the Daqing River in the Bohai Bay, a small military sailboat is stationed every day. It is the transportation boat of a certain regiment. Since the start of production, Deputy Squad Leader Song Xiuting, Party member Jia Xing, and Zhang Fu have been sailing this boat to transport grain, tools, fodder, and all supplies for the production units to Shijiu Tuo.
    On May 4th, the southwest wind was very strong, and there wasn't much grain left on the dock. Song Xiuting figured he could avoid the wind today and repair the boat. Just as he walked to the telephone room to ask for instructions, Deputy Section Chief Chen from the Tuo called: "We're out of grain, you must deliver the grain no matter what." Song Xiuting thought: How can the five hundred people on the Tuo manage without grain? He told everyone to load the grain on the dock onto the boat. Without even eating, he, Jia Xing, and Zhang Fu raised anchor and sailed towards Shijiu Tuo, twenty miles away.
    The southwest wind was still howling. Waves more than three feet high were stirred up on the sea. When the two punting poles were pulled out of the mud, the boat retreated. The three men poled and rowed, sweating profusely, and only traveled half a mile in an hour. Later, when the boat could no longer move, they jumped into the water and pulled the boat forward. The seawater hit their faces, cold and salty, and their feet were pierced by clam shells. But difficulties did not stop them. After traveling more than ten miles, the wind did not stop, but the water became deeper. They decided to drop anchor and wait for the wind to subside. Jia Xing and Zhang Fu shivered with cold and hid in the cabin to warm up. Song Xiuting held the rudder anxiously, looking at the sky. Several comrades who went to the Tuo with the boat repeatedly advised him: "The weather is bad today, why not turn back?" Comrade Song Xiuting firmly replied: "We must deliver it no matter what."
    At three o'clock in the afternoon, a black cloud came from the northwest. All the boats in the area lowered their masts. Song Xiuting looked at it and quickly said: "Come out quickly, raise the anchor and lower the mast, let's rush upwards, a big storm is coming." Before the awning rope was fastened, and before the anchor was pulled up, the storm had already arrived! Waves as high as houses surged one after another. The three of them pulled the anchor rope until their hands were swollen. However, they could not forget the comrades on the Tuo who had no grain to eat, and they kept in mind the orders of their superiors: to deliver the grain no matter what. In this way, they continued to fight against the raging wind and rain without eating all day.
    An hour later, the wind calmed down, and they happily sailed towards Shijiu Tuo. At half past five, they safely arrived at Shijiu Tuo, successfully completing the grain transport mission.

　　狂风暴雨中的运粮船
    穆仁
    渤海湾的大清河口上，每天都有一只军用小帆船停在那里。那是某团的运输小船。副班长宋秀廷，党员贾兴和张富三个同志，自从生产以来就驾着这只船，往石臼坨运送粮食、工具、草料等生产部队的一切用品。
    五月四日那天，西南风刮的很大，码头上的粮食也不多了。宋秀廷计算着今天可以避避风，修理一下小船了。刚走到电话室想请示一下，坨上的陈副股长打了电话来：“粮食已经没有了，你们无论如何也得把粮食送来。”宋秀廷想到：坨上五百多人缺了粮食怎能行呢？便招呼大家把码头上的粮食装到船上。连饭都没吃就和贾兴、张富起了锚，向二十里外的石臼坨驶去。
    西南风仍是呼呼的刮着。海面上掀起了三尺多高的波浪。两枝篙竿从泥里拔出来，船也就退了回来。三个人连撑带划，累的混身是汗，一个钟头才走了半里地。到后来船实在没法走了，他们便跳进水去拉着船前进。海水打在脸上又凉又咸，脚也被蛤蜊皮扎破了。但困难没有把他们挡住。又走了十多里地，风没有停，海水却深了，他们决定下锚等风小了再走。贾兴和张富冻的直哆嗦，躲到舱里暖和去了。宋秀廷把着舵杆焦急的望着天。随船到坨上去的几个同志，几次劝他：“今天天气不好，不如放回去。”宋秀廷同志坚决地回答说：“无论如何也要送去。”
    午后三点钟，从西北上过来一片黑云。各处的船都把桅杆落了。宋秀廷看了看急忙说：“快出来起锚落杆，咱们往上抢，大风暴雨就要过来。”篷绳还没有扣好，锚还没拉起来，暴风已经到了！像房屋那样高的大浪一个跟着一个地涌上来。他们三个人拉着锚绳手都挣肿了。但是，他们忘不了在坨上没粮吃的同志，也紧记着上级的命令：无论如何要把粮送到。就这样，他们一天没有吃饭，继续和狂风骤雨搏斗着。
    一个钟头以后，风平稳了，他们欢欢喜喜的向石臼坨驶去。五点半钟安全的到了石臼坨，胜利的完成了运粮任务。
