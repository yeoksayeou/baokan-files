Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 5th. The Second Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles was held from the 12th to the 17th of last month. This conference focused on discussing the adjustment of industry and commerce. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Cao Diqiu delivered a report entitled "The Chongqing Government's Work in the Past Four Months and the Central Tasks for the Future." He pointed out that since the first People's Representative Conference of All Circles was held in January of this year, Chongqing's industry and commerce have been gradually recovering and improving. According to statistics, 2,918 enterprises in twelve industries, including coal mines, textile machinery, matches, electrical engineering, and homespun cloth, have been registered, and 2,655 have started operations, accounting for 91 percent. Among them, the production and sales of washed coke, bituminous coal in the coal mining industry, socks and towels in the knitting industry, have all increased compared with the pre-liberation period. Deputy Mayor Cao pointed out that this change in Chongqing's industry and commerce is the result of price stability, the joint efforts of labor and management to improve production, and the strong support of the People's Government. The government used methods such as purchasing, commissioned processing, ordering, and loans to enable some enterprises that had completely or partially ceased operations to partially or fully resume operations. However, Deputy Mayor Cao then pointed out that although Chongqing's industry and commerce have partially recovered, there are still many difficulties. The main difficulties in the current recovery of production are: the old economic structure is bloated and huge, filled with redundant personnel, costs are too high, quality is low, and sales are sluggish. Some industrialists lack enthusiasm for production and the determination to improve business methods. At the same time, there are still some inconsistencies in public-private relations and labor-management relations that need further adjustment. He said that restoring production requires the joint efforts of the government, capitalists, and workers. Deputy Mayor Cao finally pointed out that the central tasks of Chongqing in the future are: (1) continue to work hard to restore production; (2) provide relief to unemployed workers; (3) rectify taxation; (4) rectify the work style of cadres.

The meeting focused on discussing the issues of restoring production and adjusting industry and commerce based on the above report. Worker representatives used the actual situation of their factories to illustrate that high costs are a crux of the current difficulties. The reason for the high costs, in addition to outdated machinery, is mainly due to the mismanagement of the capitalists. For example, in the Minsheng Shipping Company, there are as many as eighty senior consultants who do nothing but receive money, each with a monthly salary of more than one thousand real units. The worker representative of Shenxin Yarn Factory said that the factory changed to a new director in late May, determined to rectify the organization and carried out some reforms, such as reducing redundant personnel, appropriately reducing unreasonable high salaries, and greatly reducing waste (cotton used for one piece of yarn was reduced from 477 jin to 448 jin), and has gradually achieved a balance of income and expenditure. This proves that as long as the capitalists are determined to reform and rectify the organization, costs can be reduced. Many worker representatives stated that as long as the capitalists treat employees equally and consult with employees in case of trouble, the employees will definitely help the capitalists overcome difficulties. The worker representative of Tianfu Coal Mine Company stated that Tianfu capitalists accepted reasonable suggestions from employees and established a labor-management consultation meeting. The employees of the mine have decided to reduce some wages to help the capitalists overcome the current difficulties of sluggish sales. Other factory worker representatives have made similar statements. They proposed "actively uniting with capitalists, improving labor-management relations, and overcoming difficulties together," which was praised by representatives from all walks of life attending the meeting.

Industry and commerce representatives such as Hu Zi'ang expressed their gratitude in their speeches at the conference for the government's support for private industry and commerce in the past four months, which enabled major industries to resume production. They accepted the opinions of the government and worker representatives and decided to work hard to improve management, be thrifty, eliminate waste, save raw materials, reduce redundant personnel, streamline the organization, reform backward production equipment, strive for enterprise, and overcome difficulties and strive to restore production under the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy. They suggested that the government, state-owned enterprises, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly form a "Public-Private Relations Adjustment Committee" to connect with each other so as to take overall consideration, divide labor and cooperate, and each get what they need. Industry and commerce representatives also criticized the erroneous view of a few industrialists and businessmen who only rely on the People's Government to solve the difficulties of private enterprises. The representatives at the meeting called on all industry and commerce circles to pay taxes and not evade or underreport taxes, and to abolish false accounts so that the government's tax system can gradually transition from democratic evaluation to scientific accounting and collection. The performance of Chongqing's industry and commerce at this meeting shows that their understanding of government policies has improved a step further compared with the first representative meeting in January of this year. Empty calls for difficulties and simple reliance on the government have been greatly reduced, and everyone has begun to focus on the reform of enterprises. Representatives from other walks of life also put forward many opinions on the issue of restoring production. After repeated discussions on overcoming the difficulties in restoring production, the representatives have reached a consensus. Everyone is full of confidence and determined to work hard to overcome the current difficulties. The meeting received more than 300 proposals, and finally adopted ten important proposals on improving public-private relations, labor-management relations, improving product quality, reducing costs, rectifying taxation, and urging the payment of outstanding public bonds, as well as many other proposals to be handled. Finally, the meeting re-elected the local consultation committee.

　　重庆召开二届各界代表会议
    讨论恢复生产调整工商业
    代表满怀信心决定努力度过当前困难
    【新华社重庆五日电】重庆市第二次各界人民代表会议于上月十二日至十七日举行。这次会议着重讨论了调整工商业问题。会上，曹荻秋副市长作了《重庆四个月来政府工作和今后的中心任务》的报告。他指出：从今年一月召开第一次各界人民代表会议以来，重庆市工商业在逐步恢复和好转中，据统计：已经登记的煤矿、纺织机器、火柴、电工、土布等十二行业二千九百一十八家，已开工二千六百五十五家，占百分之九十一。其中如煤矿业的洗焦、烟煤、针织业的袜子、毛巾等的产销量都已较解放前提高。曹副市长指出：重庆工商业的这种变化是由于物价稳定、劳资双方努力改进生产和人民政府大力扶助的结果。政府用收购、委托加工、定货、贷款等方法，使一部分业已完全停工或半歇业的企业部分复工或完全复工。但曹副市长接着指出：重庆工商业虽已部分恢复，困难仍多。目前在恢复生产中的主要的困难是：旧的经济机构臃肿庞大，冗员充斥，成本太高，品质低下，销路不畅。一部分工商业家对生产缺乏积极性和改善经营方法的决心。同时，在公私关系和劳资关系上还有一些不协调，须进一步调整。他说：恢复生产必要政府、资本家和工人三方面共同努力。曹副市长最后指出：今后重庆市工作的中心任务是：（一）继续努力恢复生产；（二）救济失业工人；（三）整顿税收；（四）整顿干部作风。
    会议根据上述报告着重讨论了恢复生产和调整工商业问题。工人代表以他们自己所在工厂的实际情况，说明成本过高是目前困难的一个症结。成本所以太高，除机器陈旧外，主要是由于资方不善经营所致。如民生轮船公司中，不做事只拿钱的高级顾问达八十人，每人月薪一千折实单位以上。申新纱厂工人代表说：该厂在五月下旬换了一个新厂长，决心整顿机构，进行了部分改革，如裁减冗员，适当减低不合理的高薪，并大大减少了浪费（一件纱用棉由四百七十七斤减为四百四十八斤），现已逐渐达到收支平衡。这证明只要资方下决心改革，整顿机构，成本是可以减低的。许多工人代表表示：只要资方以平等态度对待职工，遇事与职工协商，职工一定帮助资方克服困难。天府煤矿公司工人代表表示：天府资方接受职工合理建议，成立劳资协商会议，该矿职工已决定降低一些工资，帮助资方克服目前销路不畅的困难。其他各厂工人代表均有相同表示。他们提出“主动团结资方，改进劳资关系、共同克服困难”，与会各界代表们都很赞扬。
    工商界代表胡子昂等在大会发言中，感谢政府四个月来对私营工商业的扶助，使主要行业得以复工生产。他们接受政府和工人代表的意见，今后决努力改善经营，精打细算，革除浪费，节约原料，裁减冗员，精简机构，改革落后的生产设备，力求企业化，在人民政府和国营经济领导下，克服困难，努力恢复生产。他们建议：由政府国营企业和工商界联合会合组“公私关系调整委员会”，相互联系，以便统筹兼顾，分工合作，各得其所。工商界代表并批评了少数工商家专门依赖人民政府来解决私营企业困难的错误观点。代表们在会上号召全体工商界交纳税款，不要逃税、漏税，应废除假账，使政府税收制度能逐渐由民主评议过渡到科学的查账征收。重庆工商界在这次会议上的表现说明，他们对政府政策的认识较今年一月间第一次代表会议时，已提高了一步。空喊困难和单纯依赖政府的要求已大为减少，大家开始着眼于企业的改革工作。其他各界代表也都围绕恢复生产问题，提出了许多意见。代表们对克服恢复生产中的困难，经过反复讨论后，已取得一致意见。大家满怀信心，决定努力度过当前的困难。会议共收到提案三百余件，最后通过了当前要办的关于改进公私关系、劳资关系，提高产品质量、减低成本、整顿税收、催缴公债尾欠等重要提案十件及其他待办的提案多件。最后，会议改选了地方协商委员会。
