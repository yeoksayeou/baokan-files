　　U.S. Government Seeks to Expand War of Aggression, Requests Additional 10 Billion in Military Spending from Congress
    Several Large Monopoly Companies Begin to Shift to Weapons Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th] According to the United States Information Service, after Truman submitted a message to Congress on the 19th seeking to expand the war of aggression, he submitted an additional budget of $10,486,976,000 for the 1951 fiscal year to Congress on the 24th, stating that this appropriation was for increasing troop strength by 600,000 and preparing for war this year. The allocation of Truman's requested additional appropriations for the Army, Navy, and Air Force is as follows: Army $3,060,030,000; Navy and Marine Corps $2,647,000,000; Air Force $4,535,000,000.
    According to Truman's supplementary budget, more than half of these newly added tens of billions of dollars will be used entirely for the manufacture of airplanes, artillery, tanks, and other weapons and munitions. As reported by the American news agencies, under the shelter of the Truman administration's expanded war plan, several large monopoly companies have begun to shift to weapons production in order to reap huge profits from government war orders.
    Note: The budget for the 1951 fiscal year that Truman submitted to Congress on January 9th already stipulated direct military expenditures of $13,545,000,000. Adding indirect military expenditures such as the so-called "international affairs and finance" expenses for organizing and arming the West European aggressive bloc, and military construction expenses, the expenditure for the entire military expenses has already accounted for 76 percent of the total national budget. Now, if this additional appropriation is added, the U.S. government's expenditure on military expenses in the 1951 fiscal year has reached over $40 billion.

　　美政府图扩大侵略战争要求国会增拨军费百亿
    若干大垄断公司开始转入武器生产
    【新华社二十八日讯】据美国新闻处华盛顿消息：杜鲁门于十九日向国会提出扩大侵略战争的咨文之后，二十四日又将一九五一会计年度追加拨款一百○四亿八千六百九十七万六千美元的预算案送交国会，并言明这一拨款系充作在本年度内增加六十万兵员与备战之用。在杜鲁门要求追加的拨款中，陆海空军方面的分配如下：陆军三十亿六千三十万美元；海军与海军陆战队二十六亿四千七百万美元；空军四十五亿三千五百万美元。
    按照杜鲁门的追加预算，这新添的一百多亿美元的一半以上，将完全用于制造飞机、大炮、坦克及其他武器和军火。如美国通讯社所报道的，在杜鲁门政府的扩大战争计划的庇荫下，若干大垄断公司已开始转入武器生产，以从政府的战争定货中获取巨利。
    按：杜鲁门于今年一月九日向国会所提出的一九五一会计年度预算，已规定直接军费支出为一百三十五亿四千五百万美元。加上组织与武装西欧侵略集团的所谓“国际事务与财政”费用、军事建设费用等间接军费，整个军事费用的支出，已占国家总预算的百分之七十六。现在如再加上这一笔追加拨款，则美国政府在一九五一会计年度中用于军费的支出，已高达四百余亿美元以上。
