Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: A Tokyo dispatch indicates that protests against American aggression in Korea are continuing to grow within Japan. Large numbers of anti-war propaganda leaflets are being distributed. Newspapers report daily on the appearance of these leaflets in various regions of the country. These leaflets are particularly prevalent in the industrial areas of Osaka and Kobe.

Anti-war leaflets are scattered on city streets, thrown from the roofs of tall buildings, distributed from moving trains, and left in train stations, movie theaters, and shops.

The struggle against transporting military supplies to South Korea is also developing in Japan. The Labor News reported that workers at the Nagasaki Shipyard refused to tow foreign ships from South Korea into the dock. Workers at the Kawaminami Industries shipbuilding company and the shipyard in Shimonoseki are following the example of the Nagasaki workers. According to the Associated Press, the crew of the "Akitsushima Maru" (transliteration) refused to transport coal to South Korea. Representatives of the crew of twenty ships in the port of Wakamatsu (located in Fukuoka City) have passed a resolution protesting the American aggression in Korea. Active struggles against the transportation of military supplies to Korea are also being carried out in Yokohama, Tsurumi, Kanagawa, and other cities.

American authorities and Japanese police are intensifying their suppression of peace advocates. According to newspaper reports, many people have been arrested in Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka for distributing anti-war leaflets.

American military tribunals are handing down barbaric sentences to those arrested. A few days ago, a Korean man accused of distributing leaflets was sentenced to five years of hard labor by a Yokohama military tribunal.

　　反对美帝侵略朝鲜
    日本群众运动澎湃
    工人拒运军事物资并拒修美舰
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社十六日讯：东京消息指明，反对美国侵略朝鲜的抗议运动，正在日本国内继续增长。大批反战的鼓动性传单正在散布着。报纸每天都报道这些传单在全国各区出现。这些传单在工业区大阪、神户区散布得特别多。
    反战传单散布在城市的街道上，从高建筑物的屋顶上掷下来，从开行的火车中散出来，放在火车站、电影院和商店里。
    积极反对运送军事物资到南朝鲜去的斗争，也在日本发展着。劳动新闻报道：长崎造船厂工人拒绝把来自南朝鲜的外国船只拖进船坞。川南工业造船公司的工人和下关的造船厂的工人，都仿效长崎工人的榜样。据美联社称：秋间丸（译音）的船员拒绝运煤到南朝鲜去。若松港（按在福冈市）内的二十只轮船的船员的代表已通过决议，抗议美国在朝鲜的侵略行为。反对运输军用物资去朝鲜的积极斗争，也在横滨、鹤见、神奈川和其他城市进行着。
    美国当局和日本警察正加紧镇压和平拥护者。据报纸报道：在东京、横滨、大阪、广岛与福冈，许多人因散发反战传单而被捕。
    美国军事法庭正判处被捕者以蛮横的刑罚。几天前，一名被控散发传单的朝鲜人，被横滨军事法庭判处五年苦役。
