Suppress the sabotage activities of special agents!
    Nanjing sentences two espionage cases
    Ringleaders Wang Guozhen and others executed by firing squad according to law

    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th dispatch] The Nanjing Municipal People's Court sentenced two espionage cases of the "China Youth Anti-Communist League" and the "Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" on June 25th. The arch-criminals Wang Guozhen and Jiang Yunlong were executed by firing squad on the same day according to law. The "China Youth Anti-Communist League" espionage organization belonged to the Chiang Kai-shek’s Ching-kuo special agent system. The ringleader Wang Guozhen was originally a Chiang Kai-shek military secret agent. In July of last year, he infiltrated the Nanjing Municipal Real Estate Management Office to work, under the pretext of helping us take over enemy property. He secretly developed espionage organizations, vainly attempting to establish so-called "district regimes." At the same time, he printed and distributed reactionary leaflets, intimidated progressive people, and actively organized armed forces, preparing to carry out greater conspiracies. On February 13th of this year, the espionage organization was cracked by the Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, and twenty-three important bandits, including the ringleader Wang Guozhen, were arrested. The "Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" is a bandit armed espionage organization. The ringleader Jiang Yunlong was originally a traitor who surrendered to the Japanese invaders. Later, he was taken in by Chiang Kai-shek and served as a colonel in the puppet Sixth Corps. In August of last year, the criminal sneaked into Nanjing and colluded with Chiang Kai-shek’s KMT secret agent Jiang Chenglin and others to organize the so-called "Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," attempting to infiltrate the people's governments, peasant associations, etc. of various counties, districts, and townships to engage in activities. The criminal also colluded with Chiang Kai-shek’s scattered military officers to form so-called action teams and other armed organizations, arranged for some bandits to use various social relationships, pretend to be progressive, and take the opportunity to infiltrate the internal organs, schools, and organizations of the People's Government, using various means to win over retained personnel to expand their organization, vainly attempting to steal state secrets. In addition, the criminal and others also took advantage of the spring famine and difficult living conditions to instigate and coerce some backward peasants to become their pawns, frequently spread rumors, provoked relations between the military and the people, and secretly plotted so-called "guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines," waiting for an opportunity to sabotage national economic construction. After detailed investigation, the Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau arrested all 54 bandits, including the ringleader Jiang Yunlong, on March 20th. After cracking the two cases, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately transferred the seized seals, documents, weapons, etc. to the Municipal People's Court for trial. The bandits in both cases were unable to deny the complete evidence and confessed to their crimes. Based on the demands of the people and the policy of combining suppression with leniency, the Municipal People's Court executed the two arch-criminals, Wang Guozhen and Jiang Yunlong, by firing squad, and dealt with the remaining accomplices according to the severity of their crimes and the degree of their repentance.

    After the verdicts in the two cases on June 25th, the Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial on the same day stating: Since the liberation of Nanjing, the public security organs, with the assistance of the people, have continuously destroyed the lurking organizations of special agents. More than 500 accomplices have registered for self-renewal under the call of the People's Government's lenient policy. The People's Government has given them a way out for self-renewal in the spirit of leniency. However, some special agents who are willing to be enemies of the people are still clinging to the corpse of Chiang Kai-shek and lurking in various places to carry out sabotage activities. The thorough cracking of these two major espionage cases proves that the opportunities and market for espionage activities are already very small. If they continue to be obsessed with their errors, they will be eliminated by the power of the people. The editorial also called on Party, government, military, and civilians to further raise their vigilance, tighten various systems, establish regular anti-espionage and confidentiality work, and act in unison to strive for the consolidation of the security of the new Nanjing.

　　镇压特务分子破坏活动！
    南京判决两件特务案     
    首犯王国镇等依法执行枪决
    【新华社南京十七日电】南京市人民法院于六月二十五日判决匪“中国青年反共同盟会”和“苏浙皖人民反共救国军”两特务案。首恶分子王国镇、蒋云龙已于同日依法执行枪决。“中国青年反共同盟会”特务组织属蒋匪经国特务系统。首犯王国镇原为蒋匪军事特务，去年七月混入南京市房地管理处工作，以帮助我接管敌产为名，暗中发展特务组织，妄图建立所谓“区政权”。同时印发反动传单，恐吓进步人士，并积极组织武装，准备进行更大的阴谋活动。今年二月十三日，该特务组织为市人民政府公安局破获，重要匪首王国镇等二十三人均被逮捕。“苏浙皖人民反共救国军”是匪武装特务组织。首犯蒋云龙原为投降日寇的汉奸，后为蒋匪收容，历任伪第六兵团上校等职。去年八月该犯潜入南京，勾结蒋匪军统特务蒋成林等，组织所谓“苏浙皖人民反共救国军”，企图潜入各县、区、乡人民政府、农会等内部从事活动。该犯并先后勾结蒋匪流散军官，成立所谓行动队等武装组织，布置一部分匪徒，利用各种社会关系，伪装进步，乘机混入人民政府各机关、学校、团体的内部，以各种手段拉拢留用人员以扩大其组织，妄图窃取国家机密。此外，该犯等并利用春荒生活困难，煽惑并裹胁部分落后农民为其爪牙，经常散布谣言，挑拨军民关系，密谋实行所谓“敌后游击”，伺机破坏国家经济建设。市人民政府公安局经详密调查，当于三月二十日将匪首蒋云龙等五十四人全部捕获。市公安局于破获两案后，即连同抄获的印章、文件、武器等移送市人民法院审讯。两案匪犯以证物齐全，无可抵赖，均供认不讳。市人民法院根据人民要求，本镇压与宽大相结合的政策，除将王国镇、蒋云龙两首恶予以枪决外，其余胁从分子均按其犯罪事实轻重和悔悟程度，分别予以处理。
    两案于六月二十五日判决后，南京新华日报曾于同日发表社论称：南京市自解放以来，公安机关在人民的协助下，曾不断地摧毁特务潜伏组织。大批从犯在人民政府宽大政策感召下，已有五百多名登记自新。人民政府本宽大精神，均给予了自新的出路。但有些甘与人民为敌的特务分子，还抱住蒋匪的僵尸，潜伏各处进行破坏活动。这次两大特务案件的被彻底破获，证明特务活动的机会和市场已经很少很小，如再执迷不悟，都将被人民的力量所消灭。社论并号召党政军民进一步提高警惕性，严密各种制度，建立经常的防谍保密工作，一致行动起来，为巩固新南京的治安而奋斗。
