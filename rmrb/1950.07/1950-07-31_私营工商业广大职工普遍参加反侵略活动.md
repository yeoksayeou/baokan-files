The broad masses of private industrial and commercial workers universally participate in anti-aggression activities.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The anti-American aggression against Taiwan and Korea movement is gradually unfolding in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles.

The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a mobilization meeting on July 18th for more than 140 member units to oppose American aggression. It arranged publicity activities for each unit and passed a resolution to send a telegram in the name of the Federation to the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, congratulating them on their victory.

**Various Industries Launch Peace Signatures and Organize Anti-Aggression Symposia**

After the meeting, members adopted methods such as continuing to launch peace signatures and extensively developing symposiums to carry out activities.

The Rice, Flour, and Grain Trade Association set up peace signature locations at Chaoyangmen Inner Street, Xinjiekou, Pingle Yuan Street, Xuanwumen Outer Street, and the Grain Exchange. The Cigarette and Vehicle Scrap Material Trade Associations set up peace signature locations at Dechanghou in Dongdan and Wanming Road outside Qianmen. At the signature location on Wanming Road, more than 400 pedestrians signed on the 24th alone. In addition, the Dong'an Market and the Silk and Satin, Sesame Oil Trade Associations also promoted the peace signature movement among customers or within their own industries. As of the 28th, nearly 3,000 people had signed.

From the 22nd, more than ten industries, including hardware, wood, bicycle, antiques, hotels, and leather goods, successively held small-scale symposiums. Some gave informal talks based on materials from newspapers, while others identified problems for analysis and discussion. After widespread discussions, industrialists and merchants had a further understanding of the ugly face of American imperialism. At a symposium held by the Leather Goods Trade Association, Manager Peng of Ruishengxiang said, "America used to pretend, but this time it has revealed its true colors as an aggressor."

**More Than 100 Union Cadres from Various Industries in District One Gather**

More than 100 union cadres from various industries and shops in Beijing's District One were convened by the District Federation of Trade Unions on the evening of the 24th, and the District Committee sent people to explain the truth about American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Workers spoke out one after another. Jia Guangxian, a union cadre from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry, said, "The Korean civil war should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The United States' dispatch of troops to interfere shows that it is indeed an aggressor." A union cadre from Texaco Oil Company said, "The victory or defeat of a war is not determined by weapons, but by which side is righteous. Our Chinese People's Liberation War fully proves this point. Therefore, the just war of the Korean people against American aggression will surely be victorious." The atmosphere at the meeting was very warm, and finally, a telegram from the workers of District One celebrating the victory of the Korean people was passed. The meeting ended with all the workers singing "Unity is Strength."

**Propaganda Teams in District Two Launch Activities**

Workers from seven industries in Beijing's District Two, including bathhouses, traditional Chinese medicine, and cooking oil and grain, formed a propaganda team of more than 120 people. On the 25th, they divided into teams in areas such as Xidan and Xisi to publicize the significance of anti-American aggression to citizens, giving a total of 13 street speeches, with approximately 3,000 to 4,000 listeners. At the same time as the propaganda, they also solicited peace signatures. In just a few hours, more than 600 citizens signed. After obtaining the consent of the management and administration, workers from printing factories such as Jianhua and Tonglintang in the district used waste paper within the factory during rest time to typeset and print more than 5,000 propaganda slogans for the propaganda team to use. After consulting with the management, photography workers from more than 20 photography studios in the district used stamps to print propaganda slogans such as "Defend World Peace" on the paper pockets used to hold photos. The pharmaceutical industry also printed strips of paper with slogans such as "Support the Liberation of Taiwan, Support the Liberation of Korea, Oppose Wars of Aggression, and Strive for Lasting Peace," which were pasted on medicine packages. The other thirteen industries quickly and enthusiastically adopted this approach. Most construction workers in the district work outside the city in the summer. The construction industry branch specially coordinated with the construction cooperative to mobilize bricklayers working in Haidian and Fengtai to carry out rural propaganda in the evenings after work by writing letters and drafting letters for others.

**District Six Holds Cadre Conference**

More than 500 union cadres from various industries and shops in Beijing's District Six held a "Conference Against American Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea" at the Sanqing Theater on the morning of the 24th. Comrades from the District Six Federation of Trade Unions gave a report on the Korean issue. He first introduced the situation in Korea and explained that American imperialism wanted to use atomic bombs to kill people, but the Soviet Union had atomic bombs and opposed using them to kill people, instead using atomic energy for construction. Next, there was free speech. Liu Enhai, a worker from the catering and hotel industry, said, "After listening to the comrades' speeches, I understand the hatred of imperialism. Chairman Mao led us to turn over, but imperialism wants to destroy the fruits of our victory. Everyone must unite and do a good job to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and assisting the Korean people's war of liberation." A total of five people from the traditional Chinese medicine industry, bathhouse industry, and catering and hotel industry spoke successively, unanimously expressing their determination to unite and defeat American imperialism. Finally, more than 100 people who had not signed before signed the peace declaration.

All the workers of the private Jinghua Printing House in Beijing's District Six actively participated in the publicity and preparatory work, squeezing time out of production, to oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea. On the 22nd, the factory held a lecture meeting with about seventy or eighty people, and on the afternoon of the 23rd, at 5 p.m., it organized a propaganda team, including a waist drum team and a living newspaper team, to conduct propaganda at five locations, including Hufangqiao, in front of the North China Theater, and Qianmen Railway Station. There were more than 5,000 spectators. The New Beijing Printing Factory also went to Luomashi Street on the same day to conduct propaganda.

**Workers in Various Industries in District Seven Enthusiastically Hold Discussions Against Aggression**

Private factories such as Jingwei, Yuhua Xing, Dalu, Daxin, Xiangyi Sheng, and Yixin in Beijing's District Seven, with the assistance and guidance of the District Seven Federation of Trade Unions, successively convened symposiums against American aggression, starting on the 24th. The workers expressed great anger at American imperialism's attack on Korea and interference in the liberation of our territory, Taiwan. Ru Geng, a worker at the Jingwei Weaving Factory, said, "American soldiers have never suffered. They go to bars and dance. When they hear gunfire, they can't move. Don't look at their foreign guns and cannons; they're useless. If you fight them, they're just fools." Female worker Zhao Hui also said, "If America dares to fight, it's just looking for death." Zang Baosan of the Yuhua Xing Factory said, "American soldiers are being deceived by American reactionaries to fight in Korea, but they'll only be deceived once. If the American reactionaries want to launch another war of aggression after being defeated by the Korean People's Army this time, they won't be able to find anyone to be soldiers." After discussion and deliberation, the workers of the Daxin Weaving Factory unanimously agreed with Ma Zhennian's view: "As long as imperialism exists, it will always want to invade others. Does a wolf not want to bite people? But the power of the people can stop war. Look, America has not only not found any advantage in Korea, but has been beaten and lost face. Furthermore, the people of the world are against it, so its courage is even smaller." Zhang Shaohe, the worker in charge of catering at Yuhua Xing, raised the question at the factory's symposium: "What if American imperialism wants to drop an atomic bomb?" Most workers said, "If it dares to drop an atomic bomb, it will arouse the anger of the people of the world, and it will be digging its own grave." The workers of each factory resolutely and powerfully expressed their determination to smash American imperialism's acts of aggression with practical actions of hard work and production. Liu Shengde, the chairman of the Jingwei Factory Union, represented everyone's determination: "Let's work hard and produce more. Every inch we produce is equivalent to eliminating one more enemy on the front line. As long as everyone works hard, victory is absolutely guaranteed." More than 300 employees of the You Houssheng Match Factory also held a demonstration meeting against American aggression against Taiwan and Korea on the 24th. The meeting was conducted in a solemn and warm atmosphere. The workers unanimously expressed their determination to unite with the management and do a good job in production as a practical action to respond to American imperialism's aggression.
