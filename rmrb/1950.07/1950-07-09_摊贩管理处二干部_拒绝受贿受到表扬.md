　　Second-Level Cadres of Stall Management Office
    Refuse Bribes, Receive Commendation
    [Kyoto News Agency Dispatch] Liu Shigui and Dong Molan, cadres of the North-South Gouyan Stall Market Management Office in Kyoto, were commended in a circular by the Municipal Bureau of Commerce for refusing bribes from stall vendors.
    In April, due to the renovation of the road in the North-South Gouyan Market, it was decided to temporarily relocate to Guanyin’an Hutong. After mobilization by the Stall Management Office, the vast majority of stall vendors relocated to the designated area to operate their businesses. However, some individual stall vendors did not set up their stalls according to regulations. Among them, Wang Hongqi and Zhao Shirong repeatedly requested the Management Office to cancel their original market licenses and exchange them for temple fair mobile licenses. Based on the stall management regulations, the Stall Management Office did not approve their requests. Consequently, Wang and Zhao attempted to achieve their goal through bribery. Wang Hongqi personally went to the home of Liu Shigui, a cadre of the Stall Management Office, twice, but Liu was not home. On April 7th, he asked his wife to forcibly leave a cloth package at Liu's house. Upon returning home, Liu Shigui immediately reported this to the Management Office and found Wang Hongqi, returning the original item and strictly reprimanding him for this illegal act of bribery. Similarly, on May 25th, stall vendor Zhao Shirong sent more than a zhang of yellow twill fabric to the home of Dong Molan, a cadre of the Management Office, saying it was a gift for Dong's child, and said to Dong: "Only you know about this, and I know about it, nobody else knows." Dong Molan refused this bribe and truthfully reported it to the Stall Management Office. Liu Shigui and Dong Molan are personnel retained after the liberation of Kyoto. After a year of work and study, their thinking and work style have made significant progress. This incorruptible work style of firmly rejecting bribes should be commended.

　　摊贩管理处二干部
    拒绝受贿受到表扬
    【京市新闻处讯】京市南北沟沿摊贩市场管理处干部刘世贵、董墨兰二人，拒绝摊贩贿赂，受到市商业局的通报表扬。
    四月间，南北沟沿市场因翻修马路，决定暂迁观音庵胡同，经摊贩管理处动员之后，绝大部分摊贩都迁到划定地区营业，但有个别摊贩不按规定摆设，其中有王鸿歧、赵世荣两人，先后向管理处再三要求将原领市场牌照注销，换成庙会流动牌照。摊贩管理处根据摊贩管理的办法，没有准许。王赵两人因而竟企图以行贿手段达到目的。王鸿岐亲去摊贩管理处干部刘世贵家两次，适刘不在。又于四月七日叫他老婆送一布包强放在刘家。刘世贵回家后，随即报告管理处，并找到王鸿岐将原物退还，严格斥责他这种非法的行贿行为。摊贩赵世荣同样于五月二十五日送一丈多黄色斜纹布到管理处干部董墨兰家，说是送给董的小孩，并对董说：“这事只有你知道，我知道，别人谁也不知道。”董墨兰拒绝了这种贿赂，并据实报告了摊贩管理处。刘世贵、董墨兰是京市解放后留用人员，经过一年来工作、学习，思想、作风已有显著进步，这种坚拒受贿的廉洁作风是应该表扬的。
