Xinhua News Agency, 25th -- Communist Party leadership organs in various parts of the North China region have universally begun rectification and study.

　　The rectification study for Party member cadres in units directly under the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee began in late June. The document study phase has now concluded, and the work inspection phase has begun. Provincial-level organs and prefectural and county Party committee organs in Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan provinces also began rectification study successively in late June and early July. The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee convened a cadre conference for the prefectural and county Party committees on the 11th of this month, and a province-wide rectification movement is about to begin.
　　Most of the Party member cadres in leadership organs above the county level in the North China region participated in the rectification movement from 1942 to 1943 and the Party consolidation study from 1947 to 1948. Therefore, when the rectification began, many people believed that "there is nothing to rectify," and they held incorrect views such as "not being a responsible cadre, there is no bureaucracy" and "not having beaten anyone, there is no question of commandism," and they did not pay enough attention to the rectification study. A few cadres were also afraid that their shortcomings would be exposed in the rectification movement, and as a result, they showed negativity towards the rectification study. In response to the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, the rectification leading organs in various places carried out education and mobilization among the cadres, emphasizing the achievements of past rectification and Party consolidation and the significance of the current rectification, calling on them to adopt a realistic spirit, examine the shortcomings existing in leadership and their own work, and overcome blind complacency and negative, trouble-fearing emotions. A committee member of the CPC Dingxian County Committee in Hebei Province first reviewed his past erroneous idea that only beating and scolding people was considered coercion and commandism at the rectification mobilization meeting, and cited examples to illustrate the various specific manifestations of coercion, commandism and bureaucratic style. After mobilization and education, Party member cadres in various places recognized the importance of Party consolidation and rectification at the current stage and strengthened their confidence in improving their work through rectification.
　　Responsible cadres of the CPC organs at all levels in the North China region directly participate in the leadership of the rectification movement. Rectification committees have been established in various places, and some have also published "Rectification Communications" to guide the development of rectification work. In order to successfully carry out the rectification movement, all provinces pay attention to training and cultivating rectification cadres. Chahar Province first trained the rectification backbone of the county and prefectural Party committees for half a month, and then gradually launched the province-wide rectification movement.

### 华北各地中共领导机关普遍开始整风学习

　　华北各地中共领导机关普遍开始整风学习
    【新华社二十五日讯】华北区各地中共领导机关，已普遍开始进行整风学习。
    中共中央华北局直属机关各单位党员干部的整风学习于六月下旬开始，现文件学习已结束，并已进入检查工作阶段。山西、河北、平原等省的省级各机关及地委、县委机关，亦先后于六月下旬及七月初开始进行整风学习。中共察哈尔省委于本月十一日召开了地委、县委两级的干部大会，全省规模的整风运动即将开始。
    华北地区县以上各级领导机关内的党员干部，大部分是参加过一九四二年到四三年的整风运动和一九四七年到四八年的整党学习的。因此，在整风开始时，许多人便认为“没有什么可以整顿的了”，他们并且存在着“不是负责干部，没有官僚主义”，“没有打过人，谈不上命令主义”等等不正确的看法，对整风学习不够重视。也有少数干部害怕自己的缺点在整风运动中暴露出来，因而，对整风学习表示消极。各地整风领导机关针对上述的错误思想，在干部中进行了教育和动员，着重指出过去整风整党的成绩和目前进行整风的意义，号召他们采取实事求是的精神，检查领导上和自己工作中存在着的缺点，克服盲目自满和消极、怕麻烦的情绪。河北省中共定县县委会的一个委员，在整风动员会上，首先检讨了自己过去认为只有打人骂人才算强迫命令的错误思想，并引证实例说明强迫命令与官僚主义作风的各种具体表现。各地党员干部经动员、教育后，都认识了目前阶段整党整风的重要性，并加强了通过整风改进工作的信心。
    华北地区中共各级机关的负责干部，都直接参加整风运动的领导。各地都成立了整风委员会，有的还出版《整风通讯》，以指导整风工作的开展。各省为顺利地进行整风运动，都注意训练和培养整风干部。察哈尔省以半个月的时间，首先训练县委、地委两级的整风骨干，然后再逐步地开展全省整风运动。
