　　Wang Jinzhen's Mutual Aid Team
    Song Ping, Li Shaohua, Gu Yuzhen
    The farmers of Yushu Village in the Fifteenth District of the Beijing suburbs never imagined that mutual aid teams could be so beneficial, let alone that Wang Jinzhen's team of four women could persevere and achieve so much.

    This spring, Wang Jinzhen, Zhang Benrong, Zhang Renfang, and Zhang Renlan, four young women league members, under the leadership of Wang Jinzhen (a Communist Party member), the branch secretary of the Communist Youth League, established the first production mutual aid team in Yushu Village. Inexperienced farmers were dismissive of their actions. Some said, "These girls are just fooling around!" Zhang Benrong's father, Zhang Rengui, repeatedly tried to stop his daughter from participating in the mutual aid. However, after their mutual aid team was established, they weeded 32 mu of wheat fields and planted 2 mu of hyacinth beans in just three days. This labor achievement earned the praise of the entire village. From then on, the Wang Jinzhen Mutual Aid Team's prestige was established.

    Zhang Rengui saw with his own eyes that the four girls had hoed ten mu of his wheat field, using only half the manpower he had estimated, and he no longer wanted to work alone. He was the first to request joining their mutual aid team. Subsequently, four men also joined the mutual aid team.

    The Wang Jinzhen Mutual Aid Team consisted of five households with nine laborers. Four households each contributed one man and one woman, and the other household was a single hired farmhand. They collectively owned 88 mu of land. Because of their mutual aid labor, not only did none of the families need to hire helpers, but they could also free up male laborers to engage in sideline production (working at the mill).

    In production, the Wang Jinzhen Mutual Aid Team's leader decided the number of work points to allocate based on production needs, with everyone's consent. Work points were calculated and exchanged. After work each day, everyone held a scoring meeting to record each person's work points for the day. Settlements were made every ten days, and final accounts were settled after the autumn harvest. Whoever did the work ate at the house of the person they were working for, but if they worked for less than a quarter of the day, they would go home to eat.

            Working in the Fields During the Day, Learning to Read at Night

    They also persisted in learning during production. They organized a study group. Zhang Renfang's younger brother taught them to read every night. In the past, they were illiterate, but now they can all recognize between 200 and 400 characters. Lacking lamp oil for evening study, the district government gave them two jin of kerosene in May to encourage them.

    The Wang Jinzhen Mutual Aid Team's labor achievements have influenced the farmers of the entire Yushu Village, and production mutual aid teams have been universally established in the village. The exemplary actions of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have directly promoted the village's production increase campaign.

　　王金珍的互助组
    宋平　李少华　谷裕珍
    京郊十五区榆树村的农民谁也没想到互助组有这大的好处，更没想到王金珍四个妇女的互助组能坚持下来，且做出这么大的成绩。
    今年开春时，王金珍、张本蓉、张仁芳、张仁兰这四个女青年团员，在团支委王金珍（共产党员）的领导下，在榆树村成立了第一个生产互助组。没有经验的农民对她们的行动是轻视的。有的说：“这些女孩子简直是瞎闹！”张本蓉的老爹张仁贵，更是再三地阻挠他的女儿参加互助。但是她们的互助组成立后，三天里就锄了三十二亩麦地的草，并种好芸扁豆二亩。这样的劳动成绩，引起了全村人的赞扬。王金珍互助组的威信从此就树立起来了。
    张仁贵亲眼看到四个女孩子为他耪了十亩麦地，仅用了他所估计的一半工力时，他也不想一人干活了。他首先要求加入了她们的互助组。接着又有四个男子参加了互助组。
    王金珍互助组参加的共五户九个劳动力。四户各出一男一女，另一户是雇农单身汉。共有地八十八亩。由于她们的互助劳动不但谁家也不需要再雇人帮工，有时还可腾出男工去搞副业生产（到碴子厂做工）。
    王金珍互助组在生产中是由组长根据生产需要，并征得每人同意后决定拨工数目，按工计分，进行换工。每天下工后大家开一个评分会，把当天各人的工作分数记载下来。十天一结，秋后算账。给谁家做活吃谁家的饭，但如一天工作不到四分之一的时间，就各自回家吃饭。
            白天下地  晚上认字
    她们在生产中并坚持了学习。组织了一个学习小组。每天晚上由张仁芳的弟弟教她们认字。过去她们不识字，现在都认得了二百至四百个字。晚上学习缺少灯油，区政府为了鼓励她们，五月份发给了她们二斤煤油。
    王金珍互助组的劳动成绩影响了整个榆树村的农民，生产互助组在该村普遍的成立起来。共产党员、青年团员的带头行动，直接推动了该村的增产运动。
