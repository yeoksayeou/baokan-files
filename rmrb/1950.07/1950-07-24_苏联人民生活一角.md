    The Happy Life of Workers at the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory"

    As a result of the Soviet Union's third price reduction since March of this year, Soviet laborers will gain no less than 110 billion rubles in benefits in just one year. Many workers and staff at the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" have carefully calculated how much benefit each of them will receive from the price reduction and the increase in their actual wages. "My husband and I earn a total of more than 2,700 rubles. There are three people in our family," said Maria Zhibaltova, a female worker at the factory. "Systematic price reductions will make our lives better and allow us to acquire more goods. I calculated that, after the new price reductions, our actual wages have increased by 500-550 rubles per month."
    Every Soviet family feels the huge benefits gained from price reductions in their own budget.

    Workers now receive more manufactured goods. Weaver Varvara Fydorovna earns an average of 1,550 rubles per month. After the first price reduction in 1948, as a result of this saving, she was able to add new kitchen utensils and household appliances to her home. After the second price reduction in March 1949, Fydorovna bought herself and her daughter summer and autumn coats, flannel clothing, three pairs of fashionable cloth shoes, four long dresses, and other things. With the money saved from the third price reduction this year, Fydorovna plans to buy new furniture - a sofa, a sideboard, and other things.

    In the years of Soviet power, the living conditions of the employees of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" have undergone unspeakable changes. Cramped and dirty broken houses and dormitories, ignorance, and poverty have become distant memories. The Soviet regime has built beautiful houses and places for cultural and recreational activities for the workers of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" and their children. It has also established all the necessary conditions for men and women workers to enjoy education and improve their skills.

    Traveling to health resorts, entering sanatoriums or rest homes, has become a common phenomenon among the employees of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory." In the past three years, female workers Fydorovna, Grafova, and hundreds of other female workers have been spending their vacations at the best sanatoriums in the Caucasus spa area, in Sochi, Yalta, and the suburbs of Moscow, at the expense of the state. From March 1947 to March 1950, 2,700 male and female workers in the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" completed medical training classes in their spare time and improved the health of patients in the night sanatorium set up in the factory area. The state has allocated more than 2 million rubles to this medical center in these years. Recently, the trade union, on the recommendation of the factory committee, established a factory sanatorium in Eupatoria (Crimea).

    The employees of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" have the opportunity to widely enjoy free medical care. The entire enterprise has its own medical and sanatorium department, and each factory has health stations. The medical and sanatorium department employs 20 highly skilled specialist physicians of various specialties and a large number of intermediate medical personnel. There is an X-ray treatment room, an electrocardiograph, modern physical therapy equipment, and a fully equipped dental treatment room and dental prosthesis room.

    The majority of those who work in the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" are women who have children. The factory's party organization, trade union organization, and administration always give great care to women and children. The factory committee's social insurance budget was 5,088,500 rubles in 1949, and the funds used to pay female workers' pregnancy and childbirth, nursing, and infant care subsidies accounted for a large proportion. All the necessary conditions have been established so that women who are mothers can engage in production, enjoy education, and engage in socio-political activities in peace. A total of six kindergartens and one nursery have been established throughout the enterprise; the state paid a total of 3,035,300 rubles for the expenses of these children's institutions in 1949 alone.

    At the end of last year, the trade union factory committee set up a sanatorium-style kindergarten in Crimea for preschool children. The workers' children are currently completing their three-month rest there in teams. Last summer, approximately 2,000 children rested in the sanatorium-style and ordinary pioneer camps near the "Pravda" and "Saltykovka" stations and in the summer resort of "Klyazma." The preventive hospital established by the factory committee for school-age children has been established for three years. Children can stay here for one or two months free of charge and under preferential conditions. They receive high-quality four meals a day and the necessary treatment in the preventive hospital. It has finely furnished bedrooms, special rooms where children can do their schoolwork. Many qualified educators are carrying out a lot of educational work for the children.

    The Pavlika Morozova Children's Palace of Culture of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" must be mentioned. This Children's Palace of Culture is lively day and night. As soon as the children are dismissed from school, they run to their beloved palace: to participate in many groups, watch movies and dramas, play, sing, dance, and participate in sports.

    Large-scale housing construction is a clear indicator of the increase in the material welfare of Soviet laborers. The socialist state has spent tens of millions of rubles on building workers' housing at the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory." Sixty-two houses and 33,690 square meters of public space have been built and renovated for the employees of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory." The administration of the enterprise opened 985 square meters of new housing in 1949, where the families of employees lived. By the end of 1949, 80 percent of all housing had been equipped with gas facilities.

    In order to better meet the living requirements of the workers, the administration of the enterprise is expanding the factory's laundry room and establishing new washing, drying, and ironing departments. The washing of underwear is gradually being mechanized.

    The employees of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" have many cultural institutions, a beautiful theater with 1,400 seats, a club including several special rooms for groups and several reading rooms, several recreation rooms, several libraries and technical research rooms, an athletic school, and a stadium. The state spends millions of rubles to improve the cultural and technical level of employees. Hundreds of men and women workers in the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory" participate in ordinary night schools, textile technical schools, and textile specialized school branches. People are developing rapidly here. For example, the female weaver Maria Chertova completed technical school in her spare time and is now working as a senior instructor in the textile factory. Petrova, formerly a recorder in the bleaching room, was appointed Minister of Labor in the printing factory after graduating from technical school. The elderly worker Golyachev graduated from the textile specialized school, and he is now the Minister of the Technical Management Department of the "Three Mountains Integrated Factory."

    The New Life of Uzbek Collective Farmers

    Uzbek collective farmer Rakhimbert Yultsaev and his family never had any land or any housing in the past. Later, according to the decision of the National Soviet regime, Yultsaev obtained land and houses from the state. His children also went to school. When the Soviet government and the Communist Party issued a call, the working farmers embarked on a new road - Yultsaev and hundreds of thousands of other Uzbek farmers joined collective farms.

    In the years of living a collective farm life, he changed his state of illiteracy. He participated in cotton farmer training classes and participated in the construction of the collective economy. Currently, Yultsaev's family is a respected family in the collective farm. The Soviet state highly valued the labor of cotton growers and awarded him many medals and awards.

    The misfortune of the former Uzbek poor - hunger and poverty - can only be heard in the memories of the elderly. The Uzbek collective farmers now live a civilized and prosperous life. For example, last year, Yultsaev's family received approximately eight tons of grain and more than 40,000 rubles in cash from the collective farm. But this is not an exception. There are dozens of families like this in the "Kaganovich" collective farm he participates in. The former hired laborers Abdulahen Hasambaev, Masiropa Holbaev, Leilahen Matminov, and others have received at least seven or eight tons of grain and three or four thousand rubles in cash and many other products every year for many years.

    In 1936, the "Kaganovich" collective farm in Uzbekistan had a total sown area of 225 hectares, and each hectare could harvest 350 kilograms of cotton. Now, on an area of 542 hectares, they can harvest at least 2,000 kilograms per hectare. In 1936, the income of the collective farm was 160,000 rubles, and last year it had increased to more than 8 million rubles.

    The collective farm is developing not only cotton cultivation. They also have a beautiful cooperative orchard, five livestock farms with 7,000 head of cattle, pigs, and sheep, and a large apiary.

    The irrigation network completed in 1942 contributed to the increase in harvests and the further development of vegetable orchards and pastures.

    Currently, there are more than 200 houses in the collective farm. Many collective farmers' houses have been equipped with telephones. All work teams, whether in the village or in the fields, use telephones to contact each other. Electricity is widely used in the production of the collective farm. With the help of electricity, the collective farm's flour mill, grass cutter, fertilizer processor, and sawmill are constantly turning.

    The Uzbek collective farmers have long forgotten the primitive agricultural tools inherited from their ancestors. The powerful technology of the state machine tractor station has almost completely eliminated manual labor from our collective farm. Working in the fields are: tractors, composite agricultural machines, and combined cotton harvesters. Ninety-five percent of all field work in the collective farm has been mechanized.

    Last autumn, the "Kaganovich" collective farm congress decided to begin construction of an agricultural city. The center of this new city will have a palace of culture. Three hundred and fifty houses will be built on the two main streets of the agricultural city. Each house has two to three rooms, a corridor, a kitchen, a bathroom, running water, and sewage facilities. In the center of the city, there will be a new middle school, a department store, and a theater. At the end of the street, there is a mechanized cheese-making farm, several farm outbuildings, several warehouses, several workshops, a flour mill, a rice mill, a canning factory, and other enterprises of the collective farm. Kindergartens and nurseries, hospitals, and rest homes are distributed on those quiet side streets shaded by green leaves. On the banks of the canal across the new city, there is a stadium with a water station. This construction is expected to be completed in five years.

　　苏联人民生活一角

    “三山综合工厂”工人们的幸福生活
    由于今年三月起苏联第三次降低物价的结果，苏联劳动者仅在一年当中就将获得不下于一千一百亿卢布的利益。“三山综合工厂”中许多工人和职员都曾细算了一下，由于物价的降低和他们实际工资的增加，可使他们中间每一个人得到多大的利益。“我和丈夫共得工资二千七百多卢布。全家三个人，——该厂女职工玛利亚·日巴尔陀娃说——有系统的降低物价将使我们生活过得更好，将使我们获得更多的物品。我曾计算了一下，现在，在新的减价之后，我们的实际工资每月增加了五百——五百五十卢布”。
    每一个苏维埃家庭，都感觉到在自己的预算上由减价而获得的巨大利益。
    工人们现在得到更多的制成品。女织工瓦尔瓦拉·弗道洛娃每月所得工资平均为一千五百五十卢布。在一九四八年第一次降低物价之后，由于这一笔节省所得的结果，她就能给家庭添置新的厨房用具和家常日用器具等。在一九四九年三月第二次降低物价之后，弗道洛娃就给自己和女儿添置夏季和秋季的大衣，薄呢服装，三双时式的布鞋，四件长衣和别的东西。由于今年第三次降低物价所节省的钱，弗道洛娃打算用来购买新的家具——沙发、食器架和别的东西。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，“三山综合工厂”职工们的生活状况已经起了不可言喻的变化。又挤又脏的破房和宿舍，无知和贫穷都已成了迢远的往事。苏维埃政权已为“三山综合工厂”的工人及其孩子们盖起了漂亮的房舍和文娱活动的场所。并为男女工人之享受教育与提高技术建立了一切必要的条件。
    到疗养地去旅行，进入疗养院或休养所，这在“三山综合工厂”职工们中间已是普通的现象。近三年来，女职工弗道洛娃、葛拉福娃以及成百的其它女工，每年都由国家出费，而在高加索温泉地最好的疗养院，在索迁、雅尔达和莫斯科近郊，度着自己的假期。从一九四七年三月到一九五○年三月，“三山综合工厂”中有二千七百个男女工人，在业余时间读完了医疗训练班，并给设立在厂区内的夜间疗养院增进了病人的健康。国家在这几年内支给这个医疗所的经费共达二百多万卢布。最近，职工会依着工厂委员会的建议，在欧巴托利亚（克里米）创立了一个工厂疗养院。
    在“三山综合工厂”的职工们都有可能广泛享受免费的医疗。在整个企业上有着自己的医治疗养部，而各个工厂上则设有保健站。在医治疗养部工作的有二十位技术高明的各种专门医师和大批中级的医务人员。这里有Ｘ光治疗室、电心动计、现代的物理医疗器、一般设备俱全的齿科治疗室和镶牙室。
    在“三山综合工厂”做工的大多数都是已养孩子的妇女。工厂的党组织、职工会组织和行政方面，对于妇女和儿童时刻给予巨大的关怀。工厂委员会的社会保险预算，在一九四九年为五百万另八十八万五千卢布，那笔被用来支付女工们怀妊和生产、看护和养育婴孩的补助费的经费，占着不小的地位。这里建立起一切必要的条件，以便已作母亲的妇女能够安安生生地进行生产，享受教育和从事社会政治的活动。在整个企业之下，一共设立了六个幼稚园和一个托儿所；国家对于这些儿童机关的经费，仅在一九四九年就共支付了三万万另三十五万三千卢布。
    去年年底，职工会工厂委员会给学龄前的儿童们在克里米设立了一个疗养院式的幼稚园，工人们的孩子，目前正在那里一队一队地完成着自己三个月的休息。去年夏天，大约有二千个儿童在“真理”和“萨尔铁科夫克”车站附近的那些疗养院式的和普通式的少先营以及在“克略齐姆”的避暑地休息。由工厂委员会建议而给学龄儿童设立的那个预防医院已经成立了三年。儿童们可以在这里免费地、在特惠条件之下住上一、两个月。他们在预防医院里得到质量很好的四次食料以及必要的治疗。在这里具有设备精美的寝室，特别的房间，儿童们可以在这些特别房间里进行学校的功课。许多有资格的教育家对儿童们进行着很多的教育工作。
    “三山综合工作”的帕甫利加·莫洛左娃儿童文化宫，是必须提到的。这座儿童文化宫，白天和黑夜都很热闹。儿童们从学校一放学，就跑到自己所爱好的宫里去：参加许许多多的小组呀，观看电影和戏剧呀，游玩呀，歌唱叮，跳舞呀，运动竞技呀。
    大规模的住宅建设是苏联劳动者物质福利增长的一个明显指标。社会主义国家在建设“三山综合工厂”工人住宅上已经支出几千万卢布。为“三山综合工厂”职工们所建筑和重新装修的已有六十二幢住宅和三万三千六百九十平方公尺的公共场地。该企业的行政当局，在一九四九年开辟了九百八十五平方公尺的新住宅，在这里，居住了职工们的家。到一九四九年底所有住宅的百分之八十都已装置了瓦斯设备。
    为了更好地满足工人们生活上的要求，该企业的行政当局正在扩充工厂的洗濯房，成立新的洗濯、干燥和烫平的分房。内衣的洗濯逐渐机械化了。
    “三山综合工厂”职工们有着很多的文化机关，一个装着一千四百座位的美丽的剧场，一所包括供给各小组使用的几个特别房间和几个阅览室的俱乐部，几个文娱室，几个图书馆和技术研究室，一个竞技学校和竞技场。国家支出成百万的费用，来提高职工们的文化和技术水平。“三山综合工厂”中成百的男女工人参加普通夜校、纺织技术学校、纺织专门学校分校学习。人们在这里发展得很快。例如，女织工玛利亚·契尔托娃，利用业余时间读完了技术学校，现在已作为纺织厂的高级指导员而工作着。彼得洛娃，以前是一个漂白间的纪录员，她在技术学校毕业后，就被任为印花厂的劳动部长。老年工人高略契夫，卒业于纺织专门学校，现在他已成了“三山综合工厂”的技术管理部部长。
    乌兹别克集体农民的新生活
    乌兹别克集体农民拉希姆贝尔特·由尔特赛甫和他的家庭，过去不曾有过任何土地，任何住宅。后来根据全国苏维埃政权的决定，由尔特赛甫从国家方面获得了土地和房屋。他的孩子们也都进了学校。当苏维埃政府和共产党发出号召的时候，劳动农民都走上了新的道路——由尔特赛甫以及几十万其它乌兹别克农民，都加入了集体农庄。
    在过着集体农庄生活的那些年份内，他改变了自己不学无术的状态，他参加了棉农训练班，参加了集体经济的建设。目前，由尔特赛甫的家庭已是集体农庄中受人尊敬的一个家庭。苏维埃国家，对于种棉能手的劳动评价很高，曾经奖给他许多勋章和奖章。
    关于以前乌兹别克贫农的不幸——饥饿和穷困——只能在老人们的回忆中听到了。乌兹别克的集体农民们现在都过着文明富裕的生活。例如，在去年，由尔特赛甫家庭从集体农庄得到大约八吨的谷物和四万多卢布的现金。但这不是例外。像这一类的家庭，在他所参加的“卡冈诺维契”集体农庄中就有几十家之多。过去的雇农阿伯杜拉亨·哈萨姆巴也夫、玛西罗帕·霍尔巴也夫、列依拉亨·玛特米诺夫等，多年以来每年至少都得到七、八吨的谷物，三、四万卢布的现金及其它许多产品。
    一九三六年，乌兹别克的“卡冈诺维契”集体农庄总共有播种面积二百二十五公顷，每一公顷可收棉花三百五十公斤。现在，他们在五百四十二公顷的面积上，每一公顷至少可以收到二千公斤。在一九三六年，该集体农庄的收入为十六万卢布，而在去年，则已增至八百多万卢布。
    该集体农庄中发展着的不仅是棉花的栽培。他们还有一个美丽的合作社的果树园，五个畜牧场，其中有牛、猪和羊七千头；还有一个大大的养蜂场。
    一九四二年完成的灌溉网，促成了收获量的提高，蔬菜果树园和牧场的更近一步的发展。
    目前该农庄已有二百多幢的住宅。许多集体农民房屋都已装置了电话。所有工作队，不论在村中或是在田上，彼此之间都用电话来联络。电气被广泛地使用在集体农庄的生产上。在电力的帮助之下，集体农庄的制粉机、切草机、肥料加工机、锯木厂都在不断地转动着。
    乌兹别克的集体农民们早已忘记了那些由祖先手上遗传下来的原始农具。国家机器拖拉机站的强大技术，差不多把手工劳动完全从我们集体农庄中排挤出去了。在田野上工作的是：拖拉机、复合的农业机器、联合式的棉花收获机。集体农庄全部田野工作的百分之九十五已经机械化了。
    去年秋天，“卡冈诺维契”集体农庄大会上决定开始建设一个农业城。这个新城的中心将有一座文化宫。在农业城的两条主要街道上将筑建成三百五十幢住宅。每幢住宅都有二个到三个房间，一条走廊、一间厨房、一个洗澡间、自来水管和下水道设备。在城中心将有一所新的中学，一家百货商店，一个剧场。在街道尽头，就是一个机械化的制酪农场，几幢农场的附属房屋，几个仓库，几个作坊，一个制粉厂，一个碾米厂，一个罐头工厂以及集体农庄的其它企业。幼稚园和托儿所、医院、休养所，分布在那些绿叶掩映的、静悄悄的横街上。在横跨新城的运河堤岸上，则有一个带着水上站的竞技场。这项建设预计需要五年完成。
