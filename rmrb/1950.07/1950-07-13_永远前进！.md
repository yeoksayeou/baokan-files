　　During the noon break, some soldiers were copying notes, some were chatting, some were playing cards... Squad Leader Li Jisheng was leaning on the windowsill practicing writing, a large hand gripping the pen firmly, stroking left and right. Half his body was shaking. His forehead, like a damp rifle bolt, was beading with sweat. Zhang Jie, who was teaching him, was secretly watching him, worrying about him. He muttered to himself, "The squad leader isn't stupid! Two years ago, when I first joined the army, he taught me shooting, bayonet drills... When carrying a mine, he was like a willow leaf fish, nimbly dodging enemy bullets... He can operate rifles and machine guns with great skill. Who would have thought that today, a three-inch-long pen would make him sweat so much..."

　　In the evening, Zhang Jie checked the squad leader's learning progress for the day. It seemed that although the characters were uneven in size and crooked, they were complete, which clearly showed he had put his heart into it. Zhang Jie encouraged him, "Not bad, very nice! Squad leader, what do you say? Not difficult, right?"

　　"Not difficult! – How can a Communist Party member say it's difficult!" A trace of shame flashed in Li Jisheng's eyes.

　　"If you ask me, as long as you are determined to learn, nothing is difficult. Remember when you taught me demolition, isn't it the same as you learning culture now!"

　　"Don't get off topic! Having only martial skills without culture is no good either, anyway, you have to help me improve my culture!"

　　Zhang Jie smiled and said, "Of course, administratively you are the squad leader, and I am a soldier, I obey you; when learning culture, I am the teacher, and you are the student. Hmph! If you don't study hard, I'll have to spank your hand!"

　　This made Li Jisheng grin widely.

　　In the blink of an eye, it was already April. The troops began production. The soldiers were writing ditties on their large hoes, carrying poles, iron shovels... On the one hand, it expressed their love for production, and on the other hand, it showed others their learning achievements. Li Jisheng was very envious. After thinking for a long time, he put in a lot of effort, but he couldn't compose a ditty. Instead, he wrote seven large characters on a wooden tamper: "First Platoon Starts Work Auspiciously." Everyone who saw it couldn't help but smile.

　　The troops were lined up in a long snake formation, with no end in sight. Wooden tampers danced on the levee, iron shovels flew in the air, and those carrying earth came and went like shuttles. Li Jisheng was also in there, truly "the old farmer knows no leisure." He put down the iron shovel and took up the carrying pole. The four large characters Zhang Jie taught him, "Dig River Repair Embankment," were written on his arm. The blue ink was blurred by sweat, but he kept looking at them!

　　When the quitting work signal was blown, Li Jisheng was squatting under a small tree practicing writing when suddenly a finger flicked his head. Li Jisheng was about to protest when he turned around and saw it was the regimental political commissar. He immediately felt he didn't know what to say.

　　The political commissar said, "Li Jisheng, I heard you are doing well in your cultural studies, let me see your vocabulary book!"

　　"Who said that? I've only learned three or four hundred characters in four months! There are people in our company who know more than five hundred!" Li Jisheng handed the vocabulary book to the political commissar and said, "Commissar! After you finish reading it, you have to give me an endorsement!"

　　The political commissar wet his index finger on his lips and flipped through it page by page. At first, the writing looked like flies crawling, then like butterflies drawn by girls, and finally, it looked like characters, and they were all lined up. After the political commissar finished reading, he praised, "Good, good! Keep up the good work, and you can win another learning model medal!" He took out a fountain pen, thought for a while, and wrote two lines on Li Jisheng's book: "Chairman Mao said: An army without culture is a stupid army."

　　永远前进！（续完）

    中午休息时，战士们有的抄笔记，有的谈心，有的打扑克……，班长李计声正爬在窗台上练习字，一只大手狠狠的捉着钢笔脖子，左一划，右一划。半个身子都是摇动着。脑门上像受潮的枪栓一样，冒着汗珠。包教他的张洁，偷偷地看着他，在替他担心。他叨念着：“班长不笨呀！二年前，我刚入伍的时候，他教我射击、刺杀……。抱雷的时候，他像一条柳叶鱼，轻捷的躲着敌人的子弹……，步枪、机枪，他都能操纵得烂熟。想不到今天，一支三寸长的钢笔，却累的他满头大汗……。”
    晚上，张洁检查班长一天的学习成绩。看来，字虽大小不匀，歪歪扭扭，倒也不缺胳臂少腿的，显然是他用了心。张洁鼓励他说：“不坏，满漂亮！班长，你说哩？不难吧？”
    “不难！——共产党员还能说难吗！”李计声的眼里，闪着一丝羞惭的光。
    “要我说，只要肯下决心学，没有什么困难的事情。想当年你教我学爆破，还不和你现在学文化一样！”
    “别扯远了吧！有武没文也不行，反正你得好好帮我提高文化！”
    张洁笑着说：“那自然，行政上你是班长，我是战士，我服从你；学文化我是先生，你是学生。哼！不好好学，板子还要打手心呢？”
    逗得李计声也裂着大嘴直笑。
        五
    一眨眼，已经到了四月里。部队开始生产了。战士们都在大镐上、扁担上、铁锨上……写着快板。一方面表示个人对生产的热爱，一方面向别人表示自己的学习成绩。李计声看了好眼馋，想了半天，费了九牛二虎之力，快板没编成，在木头夯上写了七个大字：“一排开工大吉利”，谁看了谁得笑笑。
    部队摆成一条长蛇阵，看不到头，望不见尾。木夯在堤上跳舞，铁锨在空中翻飞，挑土的来来往往像穿梭。李计声也在里面，真是“庄稼老汉不知闲”，放下铁锨就是担子。胳臂上还写着张洁教他的四个大字：“挖河修堤”。蓝字被汗水冲的已经模糊了，但他还不住地看呢！
    吹了收工号，李计声在一棵小树底下，正撅着屁股练习字，忽然有个手指头弹了他脑袋一下。李计声正要提抗议，回头一看是团政委，立时觉着不知道说啥好。
    政委说：“李计声，听说你文化学习很好，拿你的生字本来给我看！”
    “谁说的，四个月才识三、四百字！俺们连里有识五百多字的啦！”李计声把生字本交给政委说：“政委！你看完了，得给俺批个批！”
    政委把食指在嘴唇上湿一湿，一页一页的翻着看，先是像苍蝇爬的，中间像女孩子们画的蝴蝶，最后的已经像个字的样子，而且都排成队了。政委看完后赞美地说：“好啊，好啊！继续努力，你就可以再挂一个学习模范奖章了！”他掏出水笔，想了一会，就在李计声的本子上写了两行字：“毛主席说：没有文化的军队是愚蠢的军队。”
