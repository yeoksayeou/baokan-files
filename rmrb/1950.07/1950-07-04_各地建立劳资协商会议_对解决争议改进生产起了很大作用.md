　　The establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in various regions
    Has greatly contributed to resolving disputes and improving production
    [By Our Newspaper] Since the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises" in April of this year, labor and management in private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions have actively established labor-management consultation meetings based on the spirit of the instructions, to resolve various disputes arising between labor and management and to improve various production issues.
    As of June 14th, 47 industries and 204 factories and stores in Shanghai, the hardware and machinery industry and 70 factories and stores in Tianjin, 7 industries and 24 factories and stores in Shenyang, 4 industries and a portion of factories and stores in Beijing, and 50 hardware and machinery factories in Chongqing have established labor-management consultation meetings. Other private factories, stores, and industries in large and medium-sized cities have also established or are preparing to establish labor-management consultation meetings.
    These labor-management consultation meetings initially focused on resolving disputes such as streamlining and layoffs, but have now developed to address issues such as how to improve operations and maintain production at cost. For example, the Beiyang Yarn Factory in Tianjin had more than ten disputes of varying sizes in the past year. Since the establishment of the labor-management consultation meeting, labor and management have resolved long-standing disputes through democratic consultation, and labor-management relations have begun to normalize. The factory's trade union took the initiative to develop methods for improving production, which were proposed and agreed upon in the labor-management consultation meeting. With the management's guarantee of certain labor conditions, workers were mobilized to launch a production competition, which greatly increased output. Last March, the average unit output of yarn in the factory was 0.608 pounds, and in the first half of May this year, it reached 0.865 pounds. The management profited greatly, distributing 1 billion yuan in dividends last year, and is now preparing to add 10,000 spindles. Labor protection facilities and welfare for workers have also been improved to some extent through mutual consultation.
    In industries and factories and stores where labor-management consultation meetings are well-run, the enthusiasm of both workers and capitalists has increased significantly. Workers have played a significant role in labor-management consultation meetings. The entire ramie industry in Tangshan was on the verge of closing down this spring, but workers proposed methods to guarantee increased production and income, and to strive for improved business in the labor-management consultation meeting, which strengthened the management's confidence in running the business, allowing the industry to be maintained.
    In some particularly difficult industries, workers have demonstrated a high level of class consciousness, voluntarily reducing wages, practicing strict economy, and actively helping the management overcome difficulties and maintain production. For example, the Beijing Paper Mill encountered difficulties in sales. After consultation between labor and management, it was decided to implement a intermittent work system from May to August. During the downtime, employees would only receive a quarter of their actual wages, and food would be reduced to 70 catties of rice. Employees also voluntarily adopted the method of taking turns returning to their hometowns to farm, on the principle of not affecting production, in order to reduce the management's expenses. Both parties guaranteed that the actual working days would be no less than 45 days, and that wages would be paid according to the original actual wages during the working period. Another example is the Defeng Yarn Factory in Shanghai, whose difficulties intensified after the Kuomintang bandit gang bombed Shanghai. Workers supported the management in continuing to operate, and contacted the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation to negotiate processing contracts. In order to enable the factory to break even, the management requested a unit output of 0.8 pounds, but the workers achieved a performance of 0.86 to 0.9 pounds.
    Some employees of private enterprises have promoted the management to change unreasonable management systems and business policies in the labor-management consultation meetings, achieving good results. For example, after labor-management consultations at Shanghai's six Shenxin Textile Factories, unified leadership was implemented, and work was begun on determining staffing and quotas.
    In the process of improving the business of factories and stores, labor-management consultation meetings have also paid attention to gradually solving the welfare problems of workers. Enterprises such as Tianjin Dasheng Weaving and Dyeing Factory, Renli Carpet Factory, Dongya Woolen Company, and Nanyang Rubber Factory have added some labor protection facilities, and some factories have also built worker canteens and bathhouses, or added various sanitary facilities.
    The widespread establishment of labor-management consultation meetings has played a significant role in resolving labor-management disputes and maintaining and restoring production. Now, private enterprises in some cities (such as the hardware and machinery industry in Tianjin), in the context of improvement, have begun to summarize and finalize the results of labor-management consultations, and continue to sign collective contracts to further normalize labor-management relations.

### 各地建立劳资协商会议  对解决争议改进生产起了很大作用

　　各地建立劳资协商会议
    对解决争议改进生产起了很大作用
    【本报讯】自中央人民政府劳动部于本年四月发布了《关于在私营企业中建立劳资协商会议的指示》后，各地私营工商业劳资双方即根据指示精神，纷纷建立劳资协商会议，来解决劳资之间发生的各种争议，及改进生产的各种问题。
    截至六月十四日止，上海有四十七个行业和二百零四个工厂商店，天津有五金机器业及七十个工厂商店，沈阳有七个行业和二十四家工厂商店，北京有四个行业和一部分工厂商店，重庆有五十家五金机器工厂，都已建立劳资协商会议。其他大中城市的若干私营工厂、商店和行业，也已经或在筹备建立劳资协商会议。
    这些劳资协商会议，在开始建立时，多半是解决疏散、解雇等争议问题，现在则已发展到解决如何改善经营保本生产等问题。例如，天津北洋纱厂，在过去一年中，曾发生大小纠纷十余次，自建立劳资协商会议后，劳资双方用民主协商方式，解决了久悬未决的争议，劳资关系开始纳入正轨。该厂工会主动想法改进生产的办法，在劳资协商会议中提出，获得协议。并在资方保证一定劳动条件的情况下，发动工人，展开生产竞赛，使产量大大提高。去年三月，该厂纱的平均单位产量为○．六○八磅，今年五月上半月，即达到了○．八六五磅。资方获利甚丰，发放去年股息即达十亿元，现在还准备增加纺锭一万枚。工人的劳保设施和福利等，亦经双方协商，获得若干的改善。
    凡是劳资协商会议开得好的行业和工厂商店，工人和资本家的积极性，都显著地提高了。工人在劳资协商会议中，起了很大的作用。唐山整个麻业在今春酝酿歇业，工人便在劳资协商会议中，提出保证提高生产，增加收入，全力争取营业好转的办法，坚定了资方经营的信心。使该业得以维持下来。
    在某些特别困难的行业中，工人发挥高度的阶级自觉，自动减低薪资，厉行节约，主动帮助资方度过难关，维持生产。如北京造纸厂曾经遇到滞销的困难，经劳资双方协商后，规定在五月至八月内，实行间断工作制度。职工在停工时间，只领实际工资四分之一，伙食减至七十斤米。职工并自愿在不影响生产的原则下，采取轮流还乡务农的办法，以减少资方开支。双方则保证实际工作日不少于四十五天，开工期间工资按原来实际工资发给。又如上海德丰纱厂，在国民党匪帮轰炸上海后，困难加剧，工人支持资方继续开工，并向国营花纱布公司接洽代纺。为使工厂能够保本，资方要求单位产量为○．八磅，工人却做到了○．八六以至○．九磅的成绩。
    有些私营企业的职工，在劳资协商会议上，推动资方改变不合理的管理制度和经营方针，获得良好成绩。如上海申新六个纺织厂，经劳资议商后，实行统一领导，并着手进行定员、定额工作。
    在工厂商店业务好转过程中，劳资协商会议还注意了逐步解决工人的福利问题。如天津达生织染厂、仁立地毯厂、东亚毛呢公司、南洋橡胶厂等企业，都添加了一些劳动保护设施，有些工厂还修建了工人食堂和澡堂，或增添了各种卫生设备。
    劳资协商会议的普遍建立，对于解决劳资争议以及维持和恢复生产，是起了很大作用的。现在有的城市的私营企业（如天津五金机器工业）在好转的情况下，已开始把劳资协商的结果总结确定下来，继续订立集体合同，使劳资关系更加正常化。
