Learn from the Lessons of the Nanhan Breach, Strengthen Dike Inspection and Defense!
    On July 20th, a breach occurred on the Longhe South Dike in Nanhan Village, Anci County, in the northern flood area of the Yongding River, inundating nearly 10,000 mu of land. Although the water has receded and can be blocked immediately, this breach has provided some lessons for flood prevention work, which deserve attention from all regions.
    The Nanhan breach should not have happened. But why did it happen? According to reporters, there are several reasons: First, the leadership of flood prevention work in Anci County still retained a sense of麻痹大意 and carelessness. The Longhe South Dike in Nanhan was a newly built dike this year. The water level did not reach the dike root during the first two floods. Therefore, the county was blindly optimistic about this section of the dike and did not inspect the dike or pay attention to defense. As a result, after the flood reached the dike root this time, many leaks occurred, and the Nanhan breach was caused by a failed attempt to plug one of the leaks. Second, the communication between the upstream and downstream was not close, and the changes in the water situation were not grasped enough. During the third flood of the Yongding River, the scouring situation at the old breach in Lianggezhuang, the junction of Gu'an and Anci, changed, and a force rushed towards the new dike line. However, Anci was not aware of this new situation in advance, resulting in being caught off guard. Third, the soil quality of the dike was poor. The soil of the newly built Longhe South Dike is sandy, and there are many leaks within three feet of the water-facing slope. In addition, the lack of experience in flood fighting among cadres and the masses also contributed to the breach.
    Among the above reasons, 麻痹大意 and carelessness and lax defense are the main ones. If adequate preparations were made in advance and the defense was tight, even without understanding the upstream water situation changes, it would have been absolutely possible to avoid the breach when the water reached three feet of the dike slope.
    The Yongding River has been rising since June 30th, and it has risen three times, with each flow rate exceeding 1,000 cubic meters per second, nearly double the maximum flow rate last year. Anci County has made great efforts to protect the road dike and rescue Anci City day and night for more than 20 days, ensuring the safety of the road dike and Anci City. This achievement is significant, but due to the shortcomings in the work, an unnecessary loss occurred this time. This lesson should be deeply remembered.
    The Nanhan breach also exposed that the leadership of the entire Yongding River flood prevention work is still unsound. For example, a unified leading organization has not yet been established in the organization. Instead, the responsibility is divided into sections or areas, forming a fragmented and independent state. This is harmful to the entire flood prevention work and urgently needs to be improved. Precisely because the responsibility is only divided into sections, the connection between upstream and downstream will naturally not be close, and the defense of the junction will naturally be easy to shirk. If the change in the scouring situation at the old breach in Lianggezhuang, Gu'an, was notified to Anci in time, the Nanhan breach might have been avoided.
    Now flood prevention is in a tense stage. There have been quite a few instances in various places where unpreparedness, 麻痹大意 and carelessness, and lax defense have resulted in unnecessary losses. The Central Flood Control Headquarters has repeatedly pointed out this issue, but various places continue to repeat it. This should arouse serious vigilance from the flood prevention leading agencies in various places. "A thousand-mile golden dike collapses due to a single ant hole," "One section not protected, all efforts are wasted." These vivid facts must be widely and deeply publicized and educated among all flood prevention workers and the masses, and this spirit must be implemented until the end of flood prevention. It is hoped that all localities will take the Nanhan breach as a lesson, conduct strict inspections of the dikes that have not been exposed to water, and raise vigilance and strengthen defense; the dikes that have been exposed to water should not be麻痹大意 and careless, but on the contrary, must be closely defended, and strive to overcome this year's floods.

### 接受南汉决口教训加强堤防检查与防守！

　　接受南汉决口教训加强堤防检查与防守！
    永定河泛区北部龙河南堤，七月二十日在安次县南汉村发生决口，淹地近万亩。虽然水已下落，即可堵复，但这一决口已给了防汛工作一些教训，值得各地注意。
    南汉决口是不应该的。但为什么决了呢？据记者报道有以下几个原因：第一、安次县的防汛工作，在领导上还残存着麻痹大意的现象。南汉龙河南堤是今年新修的堤防，两次涨水，都没涨到堤根，因此该县对此段堤防就盲目乐观，对堤防情况既未检查，也疏于防守，所以这次洪水涨到堤根之后，不少地方发生漏洞，南汉决口就是其中一个漏洞抢堵未成所造成的。第二、上下游的联系不密切，水情变化掌握不够。永定河第三次涨水，固安、安次接合部梁各庄旧决口处溜势发生变化，一股冲向新堤线来，但安次对此新的情况事先是不知道的，以致猝不及防。第三、堤防土质不好。新修龙河南堤土系沙质，水上堤坡不到三尺，即有不少漏洞，再加干部群众抢险经验不足，也是促成决口的一个原因。
    上述原因中，麻痹大意，疏于防守，是主要的。假如事先准备充分，防守严密，即使不了解上游水情变化，水到堤坡三尺，也绝对可以避免决口。
    永定河自六月三十日开始涨水，已涨过三次，每次流量都在一千秒立方公尺以上，超过去年最大流量将近一倍。安次县在防守护路堤及抢护安次城夜以继日坚持了二十余天，尽了很大的努力，保证了护路堤及安次城的安全。这个成绩是很大的，由于工作中还存在着缺点，以致发生这一次不应有的损失。这一教训应深刻记取。
    南汉决口，也暴露了整个永定河防汛工作在领导上还是不健全的。譬如在组织上至今还没有建立起统一的领导机构，而只是分段负责，或分片负责，形成分割的、各自为政的状态。这对整个防汛工作是有害的，急需加以改进。正由于只是分段负责，对上下游联系，自然不会密切，接合部防守，自然容易推诿。固安梁各庄旧决口处，溜势发生变化，如及时通知安次，南汉决口，或可避免。
    现在防汛正处于紧张阶段，各地由于准备不足，麻痹大意，疏于防守，而招致不应有的损失的事例，已不在少数。中央防汛总指挥部已一再指出这一问题，而各地却不断重复，这应引起各地防汛领导机构严重警惕。“千里金堤，溃于一穴”，“一段不保，全功尽弃”，这种活生生的事实，必须在所有防汛工作人员和群众当中，进行广泛而深入的宣传教育，并把这种精神贯彻到防汛终了。希望各地即以南汉决口为教训，对未着水的堤防，进行严格的检查，并提高警惕，加强防守；已着水的堤防，更不应麻痹大意，相反的，更须严密防守，为战胜今年洪水而奋斗。
