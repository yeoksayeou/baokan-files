　　Why Sign the Peace Petition?
    Q: Why sign the Peace Petition? What use is a signature on a piece of paper?
    A: The Stockholm Conference of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress resolved to call on people all over the world to sign the Peace Petition demanding the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. This means calling on the people of the world to demonstrate against the warmongers who wield atomic weapons and to stop them from launching a world war of aggression. Every kind person in the world who does not want to see themselves and their children suffer the disaster of war should regard signing the Peace Petition as their sacred duty, and regard mobilizing more people to sign the Peace Petition as their sacred duty.
    The central link in the world people's liberation movement in the post-war period is to defend world peace. All struggles between the people and imperialism come down to the issue of war and peace, the issue of imperialism wanting war and the people wanting peace. Imperialism attempts to escape its economic crisis and maintain its rule through war, while the people regard world peace as their common and highest interest. But in order to victoriously carry out the struggle to defend world peace, there must be a united front that is as broad and organized as possible, and in order to organize such a united front, there must be a program that can unite the greatest number of people. The Peace Petition is one of the programs of the peace movement at the current stage. The Peace Petition requires everyone to clearly express their attitude towards the prohibition of atomic weapons. It poses the most serious and acute question to everyone, and the answer can only be "yes" or "no." There is no middle ground. However, everyone, regardless of their race, nationality, religious belief, social status, or political opinion, as long as they sincerely oppose war and oppose the use of atomic weapons that massively slaughter peaceful people, will sign the Peace Petition. Therefore, the Peace Petition is an extremely effective touchstone: whoever signs it indicates that they support peace and are prepared to fight to defend world peace; whoever forbids people from signing it exposes themselves as a warmonger or a fellow traveler of warmongers. The signature campaign of more than three months since the Stockholm Conference has fully demonstrated the great significance of the Peace Petition. It has expanded the world united front for defending peace to an unprecedentedly large extent and continues to expand it; it has also powerfully exposed open and hidden warmongers and made them more and more isolated day by day.
    Therefore, for every kind person, accepting the Peace Petition and signing it means expanding the people's united front for defending peace and demonstrating against the imperialist warmongers. The more people who sign the Peace Petition, the more strength the peace camp gains and the more of a blow the war camp receives. The more people who sign the Peace Petition, the stronger the peace camp is, the greater the guarantee of peace is, the more isolated the warmongers are, and the smaller the danger of war is.
    A Peace Petition with hundreds of millions of signatures is not just a list, but an oath of the people of the world to defend peace, a plebiscite of the people of the world. It will constitute a force incomparably greater than the atomic bomb. The war of aggression that a handful of warmongers want to provoke is to be fought by driving the people to fight. If the will of the people is for peace, the warmongers cannot provoke war, and even if they provoke it, they cannot win. And the peace signature is the expression of the people's will. When an idea becomes the will of the vast majority of the people, it becomes the greatest material force. What is truly powerful is not this or that weapon, but the people who wield the weapons. The Chinese people, who finally liberated themselves through a long armed struggle, have a particularly deep understanding of this point.
    The warmongers recognize the power of this popular will. The frantic persecution and sabotage of the peace signature movement by reactionaries in various countries shows that they are afraid of the people's peace signatures. Hoffman, the administrator of the Marshall Plan in the United States, openly admitted to the US Senate Military Committee on June 15 that the peace movement "is the most troublesome thing for us." The current task is to make these warmongers fully feel the power of defending peace and worry even more, pressing them so they dare not launch a war.
    The People's Republic of China has now become one of the powerful peace bulwarks in the world, especially in the East. Under the protection of the People's Government, which has declared maintaining world peace as its policy, the Chinese people have full freedom to express their will and launch the peace signature movement. For many other people in the world, especially in the East, who are still struggling hard under imperialist rule, the signature movement in China, which has the largest population in the world, is a great encouragement to them. Chinese people, strive to collect as many signatures as possible on the Peace Petition!

### 为什么要在和平宣言上签名？

　　为什么要在和平宣言上签名？
    问：为什么要在和平宣言上签名？在一张纸上签名有什么用处？
    答：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议，曾决议号召全世界人民在要求无条件禁用原子武器的和平宣言上签名，这就是说，号召全世界人民向舞弄着原子武器的战争贩子示威，喝止他们不许发动世界侵略战争。全世界每一个不愿见自己与自己的子女惨遭战争灾祸的善良人民，都应该把在和平宣言上签名看作自己的神圣责任，把动员更多的人民在和平宣言上签名看作自己的神圣责任。
    战后时期世界人民解放运动的中心环节，就是保卫世界和平。一切人民与帝国主义间的斗争，归结到一点，就是战争与和平的问题，就是帝国主义要战争，而人民要和平的问题。帝国主义企图靠战争来逃脱其经济危机，保持其统治，而人民却以世界和平为共同的最高利益。但是为要胜利地进行保卫世界和平的斗争，就必须有一个尽可能广泛的有组织的统一战线，而为要组织这样一个统一战线，就必须要有一个能团结最大多数人民的纲领。和平宣言就是和平运动在目前阶段的纲领之一。和平宣言要求每一个人明白表示对禁用原子武器的态度。它向每一个人提出了最严肃，最尖锐的问题，回答只可能是“是”或“否”。中间道路是没有的。然而每一个人，不问其种族、国籍、宗教信仰、社会地位与政治见解，只要他真心诚意反对战争，反对使用大规模屠杀和平人民的原子武器，他就会在和平宣言上签名。因此和平宣言是灵验无比的试金石，谁在上面签名，谁就表示他拥护和平，准备为保卫世界和平而斗争，谁禁止人民在上面签名，谁就暴露他是战争贩子或战争贩子的同路人。斯德哥尔摩会议以来三个多月的签名运动，充分表现了和平宣言的伟大意义，它把世界保卫和平的统一战线，扩大到空前广大的程度，并使之继续扩大；它也有力地揭露了公开的和隐蔽的战争贩子，并使之一天比一天更加孤立。
    因此，对每一个善良的人民说来，接受和平宣言，在这上面签名，就是扩大了人民保卫和平的统一战线，就是对帝国主义战争贩子示威。多一个人在和平宣言上签名，和平阵营就多增加一分力量，战争阵营就多受到一分打击。有更多的人在和平宣言上签名，和平阵营就更有力量，和平的保障就更大，战争贩子就更孤立，战争的危险就更小。
    有亿万人民签名的和平宣言，这并不只是一纸名单，而是世界人民决心保卫和平的誓约，是世界人民的公民表决。它将构成比原子弹大得不可比拟的力量。一小撮战争贩子要挑起的侵略战争，是要驱使人民来打的，如果人民的意志是要和平，战争贩子就不可能挑起战争，挑起来了也不可能取得胜利。而和平签名就是人民意志的表现。一种思想当它成为绝大多数人民的意志的时候，它就成为最伟大的物质力量，真正有力量的不是这样那样的武器，而是拿武器的人民。经过长期武装斗争而终于解放了自己的中国人民，对这一点是有特别深切的体会的。
    战争贩子是认识这种人民意志的力量的。世界各国反动派对和平签名运动的疯狂迫害与破坏，就说明了他们害怕人民的和平签名。美国马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼就曾在六月十五日在美国参议院军事委员会公开招认，和平运动“最使我们伤脑筋”。现在的任务就是要使这些战争贩子都充分感觉到保卫和平的力量而伤更大的脑筋，压迫他们不敢发动战争。
    中华人民共和国现在已成为世界上，尤其是东方强大的和平堡垒之一，中国人民，在宣布维护世界和平为自己的政策的人民政府保护下，有充分的自由表达自己的意志，展开和平签名运动。对于世界上，尤其是东方其他许多仍在帝国主义统治下作艰苦斗争的人民说来，拥有世界上最多人口的中国的签名运动，乃是给予他们的莫大鼓舞。中国人民，为争取在和平宣言上征集尽可能多的签名而努力啊！
