Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: To celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and to call on the people of the whole country to resolutely oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, the People's Liberation Army troops and people's organizations in Beijing and all major cities will hold mass rallies on August 1st, Army Day, to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and will hold demonstrations and parades after the meetings. The People's Revolutionary Military Commission has issued a circular to all troops throughout the country to hold celebration gatherings in all garrison locations and to invite local residents to participate in the celebrations. The Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea has also decided to extend Anti-Aggression Week to the end of August 1st, and has notified people's organizations across the country to actively participate in the preparatory work for the August 1st mass rallies.

It is because of the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, that the Chinese People's Liberation Army considers August 1st as Army Day. From April to July 1927, the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution and massacred revolutionary people throughout the country; on August 1st, an armed force of more than 30,000 people led by the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, He Long, Ye Ting, Yun Daiying, Liu Bocheng, Nie Rongzhen, Chen Yi, and others, launched an armed uprising in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, to resist the Kuomintang's reaction. In addition to Communists, Guo Moruo, Tan Pingshan, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin and others also participated in this uprising. Although the Nanchang Uprising failed under the attack of powerful enemies, this army became part of the predecessor of today's five million-strong Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the spring of 1928, this part of the armed forces, together with the Wuchang Guards Regiment and the Hunan workers' and peasants' armed forces led by Chairman Mao, which launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan in the autumn of 1927, joined forces in the Jinggang Mountain area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, and then the two revolutionary forces, under the unified leadership of Chairman Mao, developed the revolutionary base area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi. At the same time, many workers' and peasants' armed forces and revolutionary base areas were established in various places. From then on, the foundation for the people's revolutionary war was laid. Because of this, "August 1st" is forever remembered by the Chinese people and is portrayed on the military flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a symbol of the people's revolutionary forces growing from small to large, from difficulty to victory.

　　庆祝建军节·反对美国侵略
    北京和全国各重要城市定“八一”举行群众大会
    反侵略周延至八月一日结束
    【新华社二十三日讯】为庆祝中国人民解放军二十三周年，并号召全国人民坚决反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜，北京和全国各重要城市的人民解放军部队和人民团体将于八月一日举行庆祝八一建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜的群众大会，并于会后举行游行示威。人民革命军事委员会已通令全国部队在一切驻地举行庆祝集会，并邀请驻地居民参加庆祝。中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会亦已决定将反侵略周延至八月一日结束，并通告全国人民团体积极参加八一群众大会的筹备工作。
    按中国人民解放军以八月一日为建军节，是由于一九二七年八月一日的南昌起义。一九二七年四月至七月，国民党在全国叛变革命，屠杀革命人民；八月一日，中国共产党所领导的一支三万余人的武装部队就在朱德、周恩来、贺龙、叶挺、恽代英、刘伯承、聂荣臻、陈毅等率领下在江西省会南昌举行武装起义，以反抗国民党的反动。除共产党人以外，郭沫若、谭平山、章伯钧、彭泽民等也参加了这一起义。南昌起义虽在强大的敌人的进攻下失败，但是这支军队却成为今天的五百万人的中国人民解放军的前身的一部分。一九二八年春，这一部分武装力量与毛主席所领导的、在一九二七年秋举行了湖南秋收起义的武昌警卫团和湖南工农武装，在湘赣边界的井岗山地区相会合，于是两支革命武力就在毛主席的统一领导之下，发展了湘赣边的革命根据地。同时尚有许多工农武装及革命根据地在各地建立起来。从此就开创了此后人民革命战争的基础。因为这样，“八一”就永远被中国人民所记忆。并且被当作人民革命力量由小到大，由困难到胜利的象征，而刻画在中国人民解放军的军旗上。
