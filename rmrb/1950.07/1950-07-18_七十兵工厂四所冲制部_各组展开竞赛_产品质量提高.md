The Fourth Division of the 70th Ordnance Factory's Stamping Department
	Each Group Launches a Competition
	Product Quality Improves
[Reported by this newspaper] After receiving the task of producing 690,000 sealing iron sheets (for wrapping goods) for the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the three shifts in the typing group (eight people per shift) launched a quality competition with each other, proposing the following challenges: 1. Guarantee good quality; the characters must be typed straight, not slanted, not see-through, and not blurred. 2. Strive to keep the rejection rate below 1.5%. 3. Take care of tools, do not waste a single piece of iron, and complete the task according to the original plan. The workers in the semi-inspection department guaranteed to inspect each item submitted by the typing group. The four workers on the day and night shifts in the character stamping section also guaranteed to repair minor defects themselves, striving to supply the typing group with good materials. The Party and League members in each shift played an active leading role in the work, frequently holding meetings before and after work to discuss how to unite and help each other and overcome difficulties. After the start of the competition, it has attracted widespread attention, and the quality has gradually improved. For example, the rejection rate of Sun Dedong's group has been reduced to 0.1%. Zhang Tongqing, a Party member in this group, did not have a single reject in 2,000 finished products.

　　七十兵工厂四所冲制部
    各组展开竞赛
    产品质量提高
    【本报讯】七十兵工厂四所冲制部接受天津铁路局六十九万根封印铁皮（包扎货品用）的任务后，打字组三班（每班八人）互相展开质量竞赛，提出挑战：一、保证质量好，字打的不歪、不斜、不透、不模糊；二、争取报废率不超过百分之一点五；三、爱护工具，不浪费一片铁，按原订计划完成任务。半检部工友保证打字组交来一个就检验一个，冲字头日、夜班的四个工友也保证有小毛病自己修，争取供上打字组的活。各班的党、团员在工作中起了积极带头作用，上班前后经常开会商讨如何团结互助，克服困难。竞赛开始后已引起普遍注意，质量逐渐提高，如孙德东一组报废率降低到百分之零点一，该组党员张同庆在二千个成品中没有一个废活。
