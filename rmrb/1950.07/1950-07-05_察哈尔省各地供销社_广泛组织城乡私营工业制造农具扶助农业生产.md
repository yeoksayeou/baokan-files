Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou: Supply and marketing cooperatives in Chahar Province have widely organized private factories and handicraftsmen in urban and rural areas to manufacture farm tools in the past year, supporting agricultural production.

The cooperatives in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong cities, and sixteen counties, organized more than 300 blacksmith and carpentry shops last year, producing more than 110,000 pieces of various farm tools and more than 2,000 carts before the autumn harvest to supply to farmers. From August to the end of the year, the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters and the cooperatives of fourteen counties signed contracts with private handicraftsmen, entrusting them to produce 30,000 pieces of farm tools and 500 carts. Since the beginning of this year, the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters alone and more than 30 private blacksmith shops in Zhangjiakou City have signed 41 contracts from early March to mid-May, supplying more than 14,000 pieces of farm tools. Other local cooperatives have also signed contracts with local private factories or handicraftsmen to complete the plan to supply 240,000 farm tools to farmers throughout the province this spring.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in Chahar Province pay part or all of the payment and materials in advance when signing contracts with private factories or handicraftsmen. The contracts specifically stipulate the quantity, quality, style, price, and delivery date of the products. Under the constraints of the contract, private factories and handicraftsmen actively improve technology, reduce costs, and improve quality, so that farmers can buy genuine and reasonably priced farm tools.

Because production is geared towards rural areas, the private iron and wood industries and handicrafts have been greatly developed in the past year. For example, in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua cities, the number of agricultural tool manufacturing households increased by 53 percent, and the number of workers increased by 76 percent last year. After March this year, these industries suffered far less difficulties than other industries in the general situation of product stagnation, and they were still able to develop. For example, although the blacksmith industry in Zhangjiakou City only increased by one household in April compared with the end of last year, the total industry funds increased by approximately 62 percent in April compared with the end of last year.

　　察哈尔省各地供销社
    广泛组织城乡私营工业制造农具扶助农业生产
    【本报讯】据新华社张家口讯：察哈尔省各地供销合作社，一年来广泛组织城乡私营工厂和手工业者制造农具，支援了农业生产。
    张家口、宣化和大同三市及十六个县的合作社，去年曾组织铁、木匠铺三百多户，在秋收前制成各种农具十一万余件和大车二千多辆供给农民。八月份至年底止，省合作总社和十四个县的合作社又与私营手工业者订立合同，委托制成农具三万件、大车五百辆。今年以来仅省合作总社与张家口市的三十余家私营铁匠炉，自三月初至五月中，即订立合同四十一起，供销农具一万四千余件。其他各地合作社亦纷纷与各地私营工厂或手工业者签订合同，以完成今春供给全省农民二十四万件农具的计划。
    察哈尔省各地供销社与私营工厂或手工业者订立合同，都预付一部或全部款、物。合同具体规定产品数量、质量、式样、价格和交货日期。在合同约束下，私营工厂和手工业者都积极改进技术，降低成本，提高质量，使农民能买到货真价实的农具。
    由于生产面向农村，一年来私营铁木工业和手工业已得到很大发展。如张家口、宣化两城市，去年农具制造业户数增加了百分之五十三，工人数增加了百分之七十六。今年三月份以后，在一般的产品滞销的情况下，这些行业所遭受的困难，亦远较其他行业为小，而且尚能有所发展。如张市铁匠炉业，四月份较去年底虽仅增加一户，而全行业资金，四月份却较去年底增加约百分之六十二。
