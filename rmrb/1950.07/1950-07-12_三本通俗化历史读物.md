Writing popularized history books requires them to be lively and engaging, while also maintaining the seriousness of historical science. This means that, on the one hand, readers should find them interesting and enjoyable; and on the other hand, readers should gain correct historical perspectives and knowledge.

Based on this standard, I believe the following three popular history books are worth recommending. The first and third books are suitable for junior high school students, while the second is more suitable for senior high school students.

	*A Concise History of China*
	*By Xu Liqun, published by Xinhua Bookstore*

Just by looking at the table of contents, several of the section titles are very attractive. For example, in the section describing the Sui and Tang Dynasties' foreign invasions, the title "Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition" is used; when describing the foreign transportation of the Sui and Tang Dynasties, "Tang Sanzang's Journey to the West for Scriptures" is used; when describing the imperial examination system of the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the idiom "All the heroes of the world are in my net!" is used; when describing the struggle between the ancient and modern texts of the Han Dynasty Confucian classics, it is labeled "Living Books and Dead Books Fighting"; when describing the peasant uprising of the Northern Song Dynasty, the well-known "Heroes of Liangshan Marsh" is highlighted... Although, popular and lively titles are not necessarily all good. Some books also use some seemingly popular and lively titles, but they are often far-fetched. That is not good. In general, the titles of the sections in this book do not have that problem.

The viewpoint of this book is relatively rigorous, roughly based on the "A Brief History of China" compiled by the Chinese Historical Research Association. Where there is no definitive conclusion, appropriate explanations are provided. The entire book has seventy-four sections, which can be regarded as seventy-four stories when separated. Each section is arranged according to the economy, politics, culture, etc. of each period. When all the sections are connected, a relatively complete historical outline can be obtained.

This is a good book worth recommending. The shortcomings are not completely absent, but they are all insignificant, so they will not be listed here. I would only like to offer some suggestions to the editor of this book. If this book is to be revised and supplemented, it seems that it can: 1. Collect more typical and specific historical materials to strengthen the story-telling in some paragraphs, so that the narrative is more suitable for the general working class. 2. The words "peasant rebellion" in the sentences should be changed to "peasant uprising" (for example, the subtitle of the "Heroes of Liangshan Marsh" section, which is one of the shortcomings of this book). 3. Add some illustrations to make this book more colorful. If this could not be done in the past due to "difficult printing conditions," then it should be possible to do it today.

	*Two Thousand Years*
	*(By Pu Ren, published by Kaiming Bookstore)*

This book uses a new way of writing, treating the Chinese feudal autocracy era as a whole, and extracting several issues from it for vertical analysis. In order to clarify the historical system, the author first makes a general outline of the historical sequence in the first chapter, which is a good arrangement.

One of the characteristics of this book is that it uses many examples from romances, novels, poetry and lyrics to illustrate the problems. For example, in Chapter 3, "A Special Profession – Being an Official," the story of Fan Jin passing the imperial examination in "The Scholars" is used; in Chapter 5, "Everything is Entrusted to the Land," the example of Black Mountain Manor's steward Wu paying rent in the Ningguo Mansion of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is used. There are many other places where materials such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," poems by Du Fu and Bai Juyi, and the Meng Jiangnu folk song are used to illustrate the problems.

Because these examples are story-like and familiar to everyone, people are interested in reading them and do not feel bored. At the same time, the understanding of each problem is more specific, and the impression gained is also more profound.

This is a very good historical reference book. It is more helpful for people who already have considerable historical knowledge. If the reader is still a beginner, they need to read it in conjunction with general historical textbooks.

	*How China Fell to Semi-Colonial Status*
	*(By Qian Yishi, published by Sanlian Bookstore)*

This book is about the history of China after the Opium War, that is, the history of imperialist aggression against China. The writing style is different from the previous two. It takes the learning activities of general young people as a clue, and it reads like a novel. The whole book also adopts the forms of questions and answers, reading notes, work reports, discussion meetings, lecture meetings, collective writing, and so on. All historical views and facts are expressed through these forms.

This is a novel way of writing. The advantages of this writing style are: the "story style" can be fascinating; the forms are diverse, and it is easy to deal with historical materials, so that the content is not limited by the form. And this kind of narrative from actual activities about various learning methods can also inspire readers to understand the questions of why to learn and how to learn.

This book was written at the end of 1936. The situation at that time was certainly different from today. But as history, it is still a very beneficial book.

### 三本通俗化历史读物

　　三本通俗化历史读物
    彭明
    编写通俗化的历史读物，要写得活泼动人，又要保持历史科学的严肃性。这就是说：一方面要使读者读起来觉得津津有味；另一方面又要使读者获得正确的历史观点和知识。
    根据这个标准，我认为下列三种通俗历史读物是值得介绍的。这三种书中，第一、三两种，可供初中程度学生阅读，第二种较适合于高中学生。
            中国史话
            许立群著  新华书店出版
    一翻开目录来看，若干小节的标题就是很有吸引力的。例如：在叙述隋唐的对外侵略一节中用了《薛仁贵征东》的标题，在叙述隋唐的对外交通时用了《唐三藏取经》；叙述隋唐的科举制度用了《天下英雄入吾彀中矣！》的成语；叙述汉代经学古今文的斗争时标为《活书和死书打架》；叙述北宋的农民起义时标出了尽人皆知的《梁山泊好汉》……。虽然，标题通俗活泼，未必都是好的。有些书也采用了若干看来是通俗活泼的标题，但往往牵强附会。那是不好的。这本书各小节的标题一般地说来，还没有那种毛病。
    本书的观点比较谨严，大致根据中国历史研究会编著的《中国通史简编》。对于还没有定论的地方，多作了适当的说明。全书七十四节，独立起来，可以看作七十四段故事。每一小节是按照每一时期的经济、政治、文化等来编排的。全部连系起来，也可以得到一个比较完整的历史轮廓。
    这是一本值得推荐的好书。缺点不是完全没有，不过都是无关宏旨的，这里就不一一列举了。我只向本书的编著者提供一些意见。本书如果准备修改补充的话，似乎还可以：一、再搜集些典型的具体史料，加强某些段落中的故事性，使文字的叙述，更适合于一般工农大众阅读。二、文句中农民叛乱的字样，应改为《农民起义》（例如《梁山泊好汉》一节的副标题，这就是本书的一项缺点）。三、增加一些插图，使这本书更加生色。这一点假如因为从前“印刷条件困难”不能做到，那么今天该可以做到的了。
            二千年间
            （蒲韧著  开明书店出版）
    这本书用一种新的写法，把中国封建专制主义时代当做一个整体，从中抽出若干问题，加以纵剖面的分析。为了弄清历史的系统，作者在第一章中首先按照历史顺序作了一个轮廓的叙述，这样的安排是好的。
    本书的特点之一，是在说明问题时，运用了许多演义、小说与诗词歌赋中的例子。譬如在第三章《一种特殊职业——做官》里，用了《儒林外史》上范进中举人的故事；在第五章《一切寄托在土地上》，用了《红楼梦》中宁国府家的黑山庄乌庄头缴租的例子。其他运用《三国志演义》、《水浒传》、《西游记》、杜甫白居易等人的诗、孟姜女小调等材料来说明问题的地方还很多。
    由于这些例子是故事性的，又是大家所熟悉的，就使人读了发生兴趣，不会有枯燥之感。同时对于每一问题的理解也比较具体，所得印象也比较深刻。
    这是本很好的历史参考书。对于已经具有相当历史知识的人帮助较大。读者如果还是初学者，就需要配合着一般的历史教本来读。
            中国怎样降到半殖民地
            （钱亦石著  三联书店出版）
    本书写的是鸦片战争以后的中国史，也就是帝国主义侵略中国的历史。写法与前面两种又有不同。它以一般青年的学习活动为线索，读起来像是小说。全书又采取问答、读书笔记、工作报告、讨论会、讲演会、集体写作等等形式。一切的历史观点与事实，都通过这些形式表现出来。
    这是种新颖的写法。这种写法的优点是：“故事体”可以引人入胜；形式多种多样，容易处理史料，使内容不受形式的限制。而这种从实际活动来叙述各种各样的学习方法，也可以启发读者领悟到为什么学与怎样学的问题。
    本书写成于一九三六年底。那时的形势与今天当然是不同了。不过作为历史来看，它还是一本极有益的书。
