　　Serious False Reporting by Some District Cadres in Wuxiang

[Our Dispatch] The problem of false reporting and a rough and careless work style are quite serious among some district cadres in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, making it impossible for the county committee to guide production work, and work plans often fall through as a result. False reporting occurs in the following three situations. First, it is caused by the bureaucratic work style of the cadres. These people write reports and fill out forms simply to complete tasks and report to higher authorities, thus neglecting investigation and research, and often treat estimated and imagined situations as facts. For example, the base point work group in Baijiazhuang Village, Second District, wrote the following when filling out the base point spring plowing survey form this time: The cooperative supplied the members with 90 plows and 136 waterwheels. One hundred percent of the autumn cultivated land was plowed three times, etc. But in reality, the cooperative in Wuxiang County supplied only 24 waterwheels to the entire county. After the county committee discovered this problem, it questioned and checked the work group by telephone. The result was: the cooperative did not supply any waterwheels to the members, and only supplied 11 plows; only 71 percent of the autumn fields were plowed three times. The Second District reported the situation of water conservancy construction for the first time saying that the water conservancy construction in the district could irrigate 1,998 mu of land, but the second time it reported that it could only irrigate 1,378 mu, a difference of 500 mu, which made the office helpless. Another is the bad habit of "reporting only good news, not bad." People who write reports only present achievements, and write very little about shortcomings. They are afraid that the higher authorities will question why there are shortcomings; others criticize "a certain district has many shortcomings," so they dare not boldly expose the shortcomings and deviations in their work, causing the errors and deviations to continue to exist; and develop from small to large. For example, when the First District Committee reported to the County Committee on its work in May, it wrote 15 pages, about 5,500 words, of which 14 pages were achievements and experiences; half a page wrote about three shortcomings, about 120 words. When the Fifth District Committee reported to the County Committee on the summary of the hail disaster, the achievements and experiences were written in a specific and analytical manner; the lessons of failure were only mentioned in two general sentences. In fact, the hail disaster in the Fifth District was very serious, with 6,264 mu of wheat completely destroyed by hail, and 5,144 mu of autumn fields had to be replanted completely. However, judging from the report, the hail prevention work was not done badly, and the losses were far less serious than this. After the hail disaster, the county committee organized a work group to go to the disaster area for post-disaster inspection. The masses' production enthusiasm was very low, and 380 households were still facing immediate livelihood difficulties. The district and village cadres also failed to deeply mobilize the masses to carry out replanting work. In addition, some cadres used the excuse of improving leadership methods (referring to improving the situation of excessive issuance of forms and excessive demand for numbers) and were unwilling to conduct in-depth investigation and research. They believed that improving the work style meant not wanting materials, not reporting, and not filling out necessary forms at all. When necessary forms are issued or reports are required, they say: "The leadership style still has problems. They say they don't want forms, but they still want to teach us how to fill them out." At this time, they grab a piece of this and a piece of that, and fill it out inconsistently, to deal with the superiors. For example, the joint defense cadres of Zhao Jiazhuang in the Third District, wrote conflicting information in the hail prevention preparation form: Shikou Village has 50 iron cannons, and there are 68 hail prevention platforms.
The above three situations have been thoroughly settled in the recent county-wide expanded cadre meeting. The county committee requires everyone to seek truth from facts and do a good job in investigation and research.

### 武乡部分区干部假报告作风严重

　　武乡部分区干部假报告作风严重
    【本报讯】山西省武乡县部分区干部假报告与粗枝大叶作风相当严重，使得县委对生产工作无法指导，工作计划常因而落空。假报告的发生有以下三种情况。一是由于干部的官僚主义作风所致。这些人写汇报填表格只是单纯地为了完成任务交代上级，因而忽视调查研究，常把估计想像的情况当成事实。如二区白家庄村基点工作组，在这次填基点春耕调查表时写道：合作社供给了社员九十张犁、一百三十六架水车。秋耕地百分之百的耕了三遍等。但实际上武乡县社供给全县水车才二十四架。县委发现这个问题后，就在电话上向该工作组进行追问与检查。结果是：合作社一架水车也没有供给社员，犁也只供给了十一张；秋田耕三遍的只达百分之七十一。二区第一次汇报水利建设情况说，该区水利建设能浇地一千九百九十八亩，但是第二次时汇报却说是才能浇一千三百七十八亩，当中差了五百亩，弄的办公室毫无办法。另一种是“报喜不报忧”的恶劣作风。写报告的人光摆成绩，缺点写得很少。他们怕上级责问为什么有了缺点；别人指责“某区有很多缺点”，因而不敢大胆的揭发工作中的缺点和偏向，使错误和偏向继续存在；并由小而大的发展起来。如一区区委向县委报告五月份工作时写了十五张，约有五千五百余字，其中十四张是成绩经验；少半张写了三个缺点、约一百二十余字。五区区委向县委报告雹灾总结，成绩经验写的既具体而且有分析；失败的教训只笼统地谈了两句。实际上五区雹灾是很严重的，六千二百六十四亩麦子被雹打得全无收成，秋田有五千一百四十四亩完全得补种。可是要从汇报上看来，防雹工作既做得不坏，损失也远不如此严重。雹灾后，县委组织了工作组到灾区进行善后检查。群众生产情绪十分低落，尚有三百八十户眼前生活困难，区村干部也没有深入发动群众进行补种工作。此外，并有一些干部借口改进领导方法（指改进滥发表格、滥要数字的情况），而不愿深入调查研究。他们以为改进工作作风就是根本不要材料不汇报不填必要的表格。当发下必要的表格或要汇报时，就说：“领导作风还有毛病，嘴说不要表格，但是又要教填表格。”这时就东抓一宗西抓一套，填的牛头不对马嘴，去应付上级。如三区赵家庄联防干部、填防雹准备表就写得前后矛盾：石科村有铁炮五十门，防雹台就有六十八个。
    以上三种情况，在最近的全县扩大干部会议上已彻底做了清算，县委要求大家实事求是做好调查研究工作。
