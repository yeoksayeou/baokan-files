Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd. Shanghai's warehouse inventory work has been completed. Under the direct leadership of the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Material Inventory and Allocation Committee, Shanghai inventoried a total of 620 warehouses, including 122 taken-over warehouses and 498 enterprise warehouses. Among the taken-over warehouses, excluding military warehouses, there were 73 warehouses for industrial and mining equipment and general materials, with a total inventory of 245,060 tons, worth approximately 3.11 trillion RMB. Of this, materials with a total value of over 231.1 billion RMB have been allocated to various regions by the branch. The total value of materials available for allocation from enterprise warehouses belonging to the Industrial Department, Transportation Department, China Merchants Bureau, and Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau of the East China Military and Political Committee was over 86.9 billion RMB. In addition, the scrap materials cleared from the aforementioned taken-over and enterprise warehouses were entrusted to the Shanghai Trust Commercial Bank for sale by the inventory branch, and over 10.2 billion RMB in proceeds were recovered in May and June.

　　This warehouse material inventory work was comprehensive and relatively thorough. This is a result of all personnel involved in the inventory of warehouse materials in various departments implementing the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work and strengthening the concept of cherishing national wealth. After inventorying all materials scattered in 620 warehouses, there were unified and accurate accounts, and unrecorded materials were eliminated. "Useless materials" that were lying idle were transformed into useful materials. Materials urgently awaiting disposal were gradually being properly handled. Damaged machine parts awaiting repair have either been repaired or are being prepared for repair. These achievements have laid the foundation for unified allocation of materials and warehouse management in the future.

　　Inventorying warehouse materials is a complex and arduous task. In the initial investigation, re-investigation, valuation, numbering, and tabulation, many difficulties were encountered, and some shortcomings and errors occurred. Some warehouses had undergone two or three inventories in the past, and the material counts and accounts were relatively accurate. However, many warehouses had a poor working foundation in the past and were eager to complete the task on schedule, resulting in rough work. The general opinion of the staff participating in the inventory was that "valuation work is difficult" because there are many types of materials, and the use and degree of damage of some materials are not easy to identify, and some do not have market prices as a basis. After the branch organized experts to go to the warehouse to help identify and compare, approximate valuations were made. Some inaccuracies in the work are planned to be corrected in future warehouse management work.

　　After this inventory, everyone has a clearer understanding of the importance of warehouse management and maintenance. The biggest difficulty at present is the shortage of warehouses, and many materials are still stored in the open air. Secondly, the equipment in existing warehouses is poor, especially the storage management and maintenance of pharmaceuticals, electrical, and chemical equipment needs to be improved; machinery and hardware equipment also need to be wiped and oiled. These all remain to be properly addressed in future warehouse management work.

### 上海清理仓库完毕  共计清查仓库六百二十座清出物资价值三万一千亿

　　上海清理仓库完毕
    共计清查仓库六百二十座清出物资价值三万一千亿
    【新华社上海二十三日电】上海仓库物资清理工作已经完成。在全国仓库物资清理调配委员会华东分会直接领导下，上海市总共清查了六百二十座仓库，包括接管仓库一百二十二座和企业仓库四百九十八座。接管仓库中除军事仓库外，工矿器材及一般物资的仓库共七十三座，库存物资共计二十四万五千零六十吨，总值约合人民币三万一千一百多亿元；其中已由分会先后调拨至各地的物资总值为二千三百一十余亿元。华东军政委员会工业部、交通部、招商局和上海市人民政府卫生局等部门所属企业仓库中可供调拨的物资总值为八百六十九亿余元。此外，上述接管和企业仓库中所清出的残旧物资，经清理分会委托上海信托商行变卖，在五、六两月份已收回价款一百零二亿多元。
    这次仓库物资清理工作是全面性的，也做得比较彻底，这是由于各部门有关清理仓库物资的所有人员贯彻执行政务院关于统一国家财经工作的决定，加强了爱护国家财富观念的结果。分散在六百二十个仓库的全部物资经过清查后有了统一而准确的账目，同时消灭了漏账物资；使呆放着的“无用物资”变为有用的物资；急待处理的物资，也陆续得到适当处理；待修配的残破机件，有的已经修好，有的正在准备修理。这些成绩都为今后统一调拨物资和仓库管理工作奠定了基础。
    清查仓库物资是一件复杂而艰巨的工作，在初查、复查、估价、编号、造表等工作中，都曾遇到不少困难，发生了若干缺点和错误。有些仓库由于过去已经过两、三次清理，物资计数和账目接近正确。但许多仓库过去工作基础较差，又要急于争取按期完成任务，工作粗糙。参加清理工作人员的一般意见是“估价工作难做”，因为物资种类繁多，有些物资的用途及其损旧的程度不容易识别，有的则没有市价作依据。经过分会组织专家们到仓库去帮助识别、比较后，才作出约略估价。工作中某些不够精确的地方，准备在将来仓库管理工作中来纠正。
    经过这次清理后，大家更明确认识了仓库管理和保养工作的重要。目前最大的困难是仓库较少，不少物资仍露天放着。其次，现有仓库的设备较差，特别是医药用品、电工、化学器材的储藏管理及保养工作，更需注意改进；机器、五金器材也要擦拭注油。这些都还有待于今后仓库管理工作中去适当处理。
