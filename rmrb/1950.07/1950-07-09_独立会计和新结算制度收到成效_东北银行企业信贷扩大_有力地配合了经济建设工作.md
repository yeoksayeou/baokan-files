　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th: Since the beginning of this year, the Northeast Bank has expanded enterprise credit loans, effectively cooperating with economic construction. For example, taking the loan amount in December of last year as 100, it was 130 in January of this year, 138 in February, 216 in March, 295 in April, and 344 in May. These loans have played a significant role in solving the capital shortage difficulties of various units. They have provided considerable assistance to the trade department's companies for procurement orders and processing manufacturing, to the industrial sector for seasonal raw material storage and finished product storage, to forestry for logging, and to the salt industry for construction, as well as to the capital difficulties of various local state-owned enterprises and some private industrial and commercial enterprises, enabling them to smoothly complete their production plans. At the same time, the bank gained a preliminary understanding of the capital turnover situation of various enterprises during the credit process, and was therefore able to actively advise certain enterprises that had problems with low product quality and high prices, a disconnect between production and sales, or excessive storage of raw materials that tied up capital, prompting them to utilize the tied-up capital, initially realizing the role of "using credit to supervise production."
    The increase in the bank's credit power is due to the implementation of the independent accounting system and the new settlement system by the state-owned enterprise sector and the bank itself, following the order of the Northeast People's Government on January 10th of this year. As independent accounting units, after determining their capital, factories and mines are responsible for handling their own claims and debts, and calculating their operating profits and losses. This method can promote the strengthening of economic accounting by various enterprises under the overall national plan, improve product quality, reduce costs, and accelerate capital turnover, thereby greatly reducing the need for loans from the bank. The new settlement system stipulates that all transactions between enterprises should be settled through the bank. For example, when Company A buys goods from Company B, the amount payable is deducted by the bank from Company A's deposit and transferred to Company B's account. If Company A's deposit is insufficient to pay, it can apply for credit from the bank. Company A and Company B do not directly engage in borrowing and lending relationships, nor are they allowed to directly exchange cash. Since cash is concentrated in the bank, the bank has the power to conduct large-scale credit.
    However, the current credit plan is not accurate enough. The actual loan figure of the Northeast Bank in the first quarter exceeded the plan by 2.3 times. For example, some enterprise units requested temporary additions because the original planned loan amount was too small, while others borrowed too much and most of it was not used. Some enterprises' products could not be sold due to excessively high prices, or they stored excessive unnecessary materials, resulting in tied-up capital.
    The Northeast Bank is now specifically studying the credit changes of each enterprise based on the various characteristics of each enterprise, in order to review the plans of each unit and minimize temporary credit. Enterprises with tied-up credit are given a deadline to clear the tied-up products or materials, so that capital can be quickly utilized.

　　独立会计和新结算制度收到成效
    东北银行企业信贷扩大
    有力地配合了经济建设工作
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北银行自今年以来扩大了企业信用贷款，有力地配合了经济建设。如以去年十二月放款数为一○○，今年一月则为一三○，二月为一三八，三月为二一六，四月为二九五，五月为三四四。这些贷款，对解决各单位资金不足的困难起了很大作用。如对贸易部各公司的采购定货、加工制造，工业部门的季节性原料储存、成品储存，林业采伐，盐业修建等所需资金，以及各地公营企业、部分私营工商业的资金困难，都给予很多帮助，使能顺利完成生产计划。同时，银行在信贷中初步了解了各企业资金周转情况，因而得以对某些因产品质低价高，产销脱节，或因过多储存原材料而积压了资金的企业进行积极建议，促其运用所积压的资金，初步实现了“以信贷监督生产”的作用。
    银行信贷力量的增加，是由于公营企业部门及银行本身，执行了今年一月十日东北人民政府命令，实行独立会计制度和新的结算制度的结果。作为独立会计单位的各厂矿，在确定资金后，自己负责处理债权债务，计算营业损益。这个办法，可以促使各企业单位在整个国家计划下，加强经济核算，提高产品质量，减低成本，加速资金周转，因而大大减少了向银行贷款。新的结算制度规定：各企业一切往来，均到银行进行结算，如甲公司买乙公司货时，其应付货款即由银行从甲方存款项内扣除，转入乙方账内。如甲方存款不足支付时，可向银行提出信贷。甲乙双方不直接发生借贷关系，亦不得用现金直接交换。由于现金集中在银行，银行便有力量举办大规模的信贷。
    但目前信贷计划还不够准确，东北银行第一季度实际放款数字超过计划二点三倍。如企业单位有的因原计划贷款额太少，要求临时追加，有的则借款过多，大部未被动用。部分企业的产品因价格过高卖不出去，或储存了过多的不必要材料，以致积压了资金。
    东北银行现正根据每个企业的各种特点，具体研究每个企业信贷变动的情况，以便审核各单位的计划，尽量减少临时信贷。已积压信贷的企业，则限期清理所积压的产品或材料，使资金能够迅速运用。
