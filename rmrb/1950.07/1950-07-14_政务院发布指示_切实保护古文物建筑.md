Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in order to protect ancient cultural relics and buildings, recently issued a directive to the major administrative areas and the People's Governments of the five provinces and two cities of North China. The directive pointed out: In various localities, there are frequent occurrences of abandoning, demolishing, and damaging cultural relic buildings of historical and cultural value. For example, the Huata Pagoda of Guanghui Temple, a Jin Dynasty building in Zhengding County, Hebei Province, and the Yanghe Tower, a Southern Song Dynasty building, have been demolished; the Haihui Hall of the Lower Huayan Temple, built in the Liao Dynasty in Datong County, Chahar Province, has been demolished by the Lower Temple Slope Primary School which borrowed the hall. In Shandan County, Gansu Province, the temples built during the Tang and Song Dynasties and the Tang and Song Dynasty Buddhist statues within them have also been mostly abandoned and damaged by those who borrowed the temples; the Shangfeng Temple on Mount Zhurong in Hunan Province has recently been completely burned down. This situation is in complete violation of the state's policy of protecting ancient cultural relics. The directive put forward the following points, requiring people's governments at all levels to strictly implement them:

(1) All cultural relic buildings of historical value and related to revolutionary historical facts throughout the country, such as revolutionary sites and ancient city walls, palaces, passes, fortresses, mausoleums, pavilions, academies, temples, gardens, ruins, residences, steles, pagodas, sculptures, stone carvings, etc., as well as the original appendages within the above-mentioned buildings, should be carefully protected and strictly prohibited from being destroyed.

(2) Those who have to temporarily use them due to factual needs should try their best to maintain the old appearance and constantly protect them; no flammable or explosive dangerous goods should be stored.

(3) If it is indeed necessary to demolish or rebuild, it must be reported level by level through the local people's government to the cultural and educational authorities of the major administrative regions for approval before construction can begin.

(4) Those who have made meritorious contributions to the protection of the above-listed cultural relic buildings may be given appropriate rewards by the cultural and educational authorities of the major administrative regions. Those who steal and sell, destroy, or cause damage due to negligence in prevention shall be given appropriate punishment.

　　政务院发布指示
    切实保护古文物建筑
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府政务院为保护古文物建筑，曾于日前向各大行政区及华北五省二市人民政府发出指示。指示指出：各地对具有历史文化价值之文物建筑，常有弃置拆毁破坏情事发生。如河北省正定县金代建筑的广惠寺华塔及南宋时代建筑的阳和楼已被拆毁；察哈尔省大同县辽代所建下华严寺的海会殿已被借用该殿的下寺坡小学拆毁。甘肃省山丹县唐、宋两代建筑的庙宇及其中唐、宋佛像也多被借用庙宇者所弃置损毁；湖南省岳祝融峰的上封寺近亦被全部烧毁；这种情况，完全违背了国家保护古代文物的政策。指示提出以下各点，要求各级人民政府严格执行。
    （一）凡全国各地具有历史价值及有关革命史实的文物建筑，如革命遗迹及古城廓、宫阙、关塞、堡垒、陵墓、楼台、书院、庙宇、园林、废墟、住宅、碑塔、雕塑、石刻等以及上述各建筑物内之原有附属物，均应加意保护，严禁毁坏。
    （二）凡因事实需要，不得不暂时利用者，应尽量保持旧观，经常加以保护；不得堆存有容易燃烧及有爆炸性的危险物。
    （三）如确有必要拆除或改建时，必须经由当地人民政府逐级呈报各大行政区文教主管机关批准后始得动工。
    （四）对以上所列文物建筑保护有功者，得由各大行政区文教主管机构予以适当之奖励。盗卖、破坏或因疏于防范而致损坏者，应予适当之处罚。
