　　The Fengtai Locomotive Depot's labor union signed a collective contract with the administration in April for the second quarter, which expired at the end of June. Due to the conscientious implementation of the contract by administrative cadres and workers, and the high degree of responsibility and initiative shown, most of the production and transportation tasks were exceeded in the second quarter, with the exception of a responsibility accident involving locomotive No. 1936. The cultural education and labor protection work of the workers have also been reasonably improved with the development of production; the relationship between the labor union and the administration has also become closer.

　　In the process of implementing the contract, the higher authorities strengthened leadership and assistance on-site. The director of the Tianjin Railway Administration and others came to Fengtai to inspect and supervise the work, and provided two lathes, which solved some of the mechanical equipment problems and boosted the confidence of workers and cadres in ensuring the completion of tasks.

　　The administrative side of the locomotive depot also put forth all its efforts to ensure the fulfillment of the responsibilities stipulated in the contract. First, the planning of work was strengthened. At the end of each month, the work plan for the next month was submitted to the labor union, which distributed it to various groups for discussion and research. This overcame the blindness of workers and cadres in their work. In May, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot adjusted its labor organization, established new working methods, and implemented the assembly line method, dividing all locomotives into types, with each group responsible for repairing its assigned locomotives. This reduced the phenomenon of working overtime before the contract was signed and improved the quality of locomotives.

　　Regarding labor protection for workers, in addition to fulfilling the various provisions stipulated in the contract, the administrative side also solved problems such as ditch crossing boards, safety railings for lathe shafts and belts, and fly prevention and disinfection in canteens, dormitories, and offices, according to needs. This further increased the production enthusiasm of the workers.

　　The labor union organized various groups to discuss and study the production plans proposed by the administrative side at the end of each month and set out guarantee conditions. The labor union frequently paid attention to publicity and mobilization work, raising workers' awareness of the contract; and promptly inspected and supervised, gained in-depth understanding, paid attention to the needs of workers and the problems occurring in production, and resolved them in a timely manner or submitted them to the administrative side for handling. All workers demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm in striving for the complete realization of the contract. For example, the A, B, and C inspection and repair teams put forward the slogan "We must not only complete the locomotive repair tasks, but also improve the quality of locomotives" and frequently checked the extent to which they had completed the contract. Due to the increased sense of responsibility of the workers, a huge amount of work hours and materials were saved, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure for the people's railway.

　　In order to thoroughly implement the collective contract and ensure the completion of production tasks, the labor union and the administrative side reported on the implementation of the contract at the regular meeting of worker representatives on the tenth of each month. The representatives checked the work based on the contract and collected the opinions of the workers, which were reflected to the management committee. Administrative, labor union, and worker representatives also frequently inspected safety and hygiene equipment in various workplaces. This powerfully promoted the realization of the contract tasks. As a result, most of the production and transportation tasks for the second quarter were exceeded. In terms of repair: the A, B, and C inspection teams generally exceeded the tasks for three months and saved more than 200 million yuan in material costs. The A-inspected locomotives all met the standards, and no locomotive underwent trial operation twice. In terms of production: sand holes were eliminated in sand casting, and rework due to non-conforming sizes was eliminated in lathe products. In terms of operation: daily car kilometers, technical speed, travel speed, etc. also generally exceeded the standards set in the contract. In terms of electrical work: the second quarter averaged 211.6 percent of the contractually specified tasks.

　　With the improvement of production, the labor protection and cultural education of workers have also been gradually strengthened. Now, fences and covers have been made around the transformer of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, the coal platform's runway, and the gears and belts of the machines. Skylights have also been made in the blacksmith shop, where coal and sand are turbid and ventilation is poor. Sunshades have been erected on the windows facing west. Foundry workers, welders, tinsmiths, and other workers have aprons, gloves, and shoe covers. Indoor and outdoor lighting equipment has also been enhanced. More than two hundred workers have participated in the workers' night school. The amateur propaganda team has also become active, performing plays such as "Two Hearts in Harmony," "Work Must Be Conscientious," and "The White-Haired Girl."

　　However, in May and June, there were still the following shortcomings, such as two locomotives causing responsibility accidents; the number of work-related injuries in the second quarter reached 50, an increase compared to the previous period; and leading cadres did not provide enough assistance to the transportation department, all of which need to be overcome.

### 丰台机务段实现第二季集体合同  生产运输任务大部超额完成

　　丰台机务段实现第二季集体合同
    生产运输任务大部超额完成
    【本报讯】丰台机务段工会在四月份与行政订立的第二季度集体合同，六月底已经到期。由于行政干部和职工普遍认真执行了合同，发挥了高度责任心和积极性，在第二季度中，除一九三六号机车曾发生责任事故外，生产运输任务大部已超额完成。职工的文化教育、劳动保护工作也随着生产的发展而得到合理的改善；工会与行政方面的关系也更加密切。
    在执行合同过程中，上级加强了对现场的领导和帮助。天津管理局局长等都曾到丰台检查督促，并给予旋床两部，解决了部分机械设备的问题，鼓舞了职工和干部保证完成任务的信心。
    机务段行政方面也拿出全部的力量，保证了合同中应负责任的实现。首先加强了工作的计划性，每月月底把下月的工作计划交到工会，由工会发到各小组讨论研究。这样，就克服了职工和干部工作上的盲目性。五月份丰台机务段调整了劳动组织，建立了新的工作方法，实行了流水作业法，将所有机车分为类型，每个组负责修每组的机车。这样既减少了订合同前的加班加点现象，并且提高了机车的质量。
    关于职工劳动保护方面，行政方面除了做到合同中规定的各项外，又根据需要，解决了地沟过板、旋床子天轴和皮带的安全栏杆，食堂、宿舍、办公室的防蝇和消毒等问题。这样就进一步提高了职工的生产热情。
    工会每月底都组织各小组讨论、研究行政方面提出的生产计划，并订出保证条件。工会经常注意宣传鼓动工作，提起职工对合同的重视；并且及时检查督促，深入了解，注意工人的需要和生产中发生的问题，及时解决或提交行政方面处理。全体职工为争取合同的彻底实现，发挥了高度的生产积极性。如甲、乙、丙检修车组提出了“我们不但要完成修车任务，而且要提高机车质量”的口号。并经常检查自己完成合同的程度。由于职工责任心的加强，工时和材料都节省了巨大的数额，给人民铁路增加了收入，减少了开支。
    为了彻底执行集体合同，保证生产任务的完成，在每月十日职工代表例会上，工会与行政方面报告合同执行情形。代表则根据合同检查工作；并收集职工的意见，反映到管委会。行政、工会与职工代表也经常到各职场检查安全、卫生设备等。这都有力地推进了合同任务的实现。结果是大部超额完成了第二季度的生产运输任务。检修方面：甲、乙、丙检三个月普遍超过任务，并节省用料费两亿多元。甲检机车都达到了标准，没有一台机车做过两次试运的。生产品方面：翻砂消灭砂眼，旋制品消灭了不合尺寸的反工。在运行方面：日车公里、技术速度、旅行速度等也都普遍超过了合同所定标准。电务方面：第二季度平均完成合同规定的任务百分之二一一点六。
    随着生产的提高，职工的劳动保护和文化教育也逐步加强。现在丰台机务段变压器的周围、煤台的跑道、机器的齿轮及皮带都分别作了栏杆和罩子。煤沙混浊通风不良的打铁房也都做了天窗。太阳西晒的窗子都搭了晒篷。翻砂、焊工、白铁等工友都有了围裙、手套和鞋盖。室内外的照明设备也增强了。二百多工友参加了职工夜校。业余宣传队也活跃起来，先后演出了《两相好》、《干活要认真》、《白毛女》等剧。
    但是在五、六月份尚有以下缺点，如两台机车酿成了责任事故；第二季度公伤达五十名，较前增多；领导干部对运输部门帮助不够等，都需要加以克服。
