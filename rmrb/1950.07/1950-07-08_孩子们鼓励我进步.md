　　—Editor

I am a 39-year-old housewife. I studied in a private school for a few years when I was young, reading books like the Four Books and Five Classics. I didn't formally enter school until I was sixteen, and before graduating from middle school, at the age of twenty, I married a distant relative surnamed Yao through my parents' arrangement and a matchmaker's words. In the first few years after marriage, I worked as a primary school teacher for two years. Later, after giving birth to two children in succession, in order to take care of them and manage the household affairs, the initial aspiration to serve society was invisibly dispelled. I have given birth eight times in total, and now only two sons and two daughters remain; the other four children, some until they were five or six years old, some until they were around ten years old, all died successively due to illness. In these ten years or so, giving birth to children and the deaths of children, one after another, consumed all the time, throwing the entire decade into giving birth to, raising, and caring for children, so busy all year round that I could hardly breathe. I never had time to participate in any social activities; I also broke ties with books from then on; even the daily newspaper, I would at most read only a few lines of the main headlines. I truly became a typical woman of the old-fashioned family.

My knowledge can be considered that of a half-new, half-old woman. From a young age, I believed that women should be independent and self-reliant, and that relying on men was shameful, a loss of one's own personality. Therefore, after marriage, disregarding the dissuasion of my in-laws and husband, I took on the role of a primary school teacher. Unexpectedly, after only two years, the environment did not permit me, because I had to take care of my children, so I had to abandon my career halfway. Ending up with things going against my wishes, ideals were ultimately just ideals, and until before liberation, I finally still became a woman dependent on men.

However, I also fulfilled quite a few responsibilities in managing household affairs. The old and the young in the family, the lives of more than ten people, all needed me to take care of them. Although I also hired one or two servants, I was still busy all day long. My thinking at the time was indeed dominated by the social consciousness of the time: men for external affairs, women for internal affairs, each fulfilling their duties, each getting what they deserved; women who could truly be responsible for managing household affairs, who could truly achieve being a virtuous wife and loving mother, should definitely not be labeled as social parasites. I then took this backward view to console myself.

My husband worked as a clerk in the stock exchange for more than ten years, and his salary was very good. He had no vices, and brought most of his monthly income home. Therefore, my family has always lived a relatively affluent middle-class life. Although I was a little busy with housework, I never suffered any major economic difficulties.

Last year, Shanghai was liberated, and the stock exchange was closed. The biggest blow to my family was my husband's unemployment; it was also the first sudden storm I had encountered in my life. From then on, our life had no guarantee. Unemployment brought me difficulties and made me suffer; however, unemployment helped me to have the first change in my thinking.

Before and after liberation, I absolutely did not believe many of the rumors made by the reactionaries. Because many of the people I associated with at that time were progressive elements, and I usually heard some new knowledge theories from them: I also had a general outline of understanding regarding the Communist Party's leadership of the revolution. However, this understanding was still very immature and shallow, merely able to express sympathy for the revolution. At that time, I thought that this revolution would still take a long time—I did not have firm confidence in the development prospects of the Communist Party and the complete elimination of the reactionaries. I also knew that in the transition period of a great era, everyone would and should encounter considerable difficulties. However, at the time, I did not think that these difficulties were temporary, but rather that they were long-term; I also thought that individual unemployment was, of course, also long-term. In order to prepare for overcoming difficulties in the long term, I first determined a long-term plan for my family to maintain a livelihood.

The first step was to start with diligence and frugality—starting with reducing the population by saving on expenditures. I asked my father-in-law to live with my husband's younger brother, where he was a little more affluent and the diet was better, because elderly people cannot suffer too much. I dismissed two servants in the house, and did most things myself. My eldest daughter, Ruilin, is nineteen years old this year. Last summer vacation, she graduated from Songjiang Women's High School. At that time, she wanted to be a tutor, which could provide some subsidy to the family, but I strongly advocated that she apply to the Revolutionary University. After being admitted, she studied for four months and was assigned to work in the countryside in Tongxiang County. She has been serving there ever since. My eldest son, Dajiang, is sixteen years old this year and is in the third grade of junior high school at Shanghai Vocational School. Last July, I also asked him to join the cultural troupe of the Third Field Army's Ninth Corps. He is now stationed in Hangzhou. In this way, my family was left with only my husband and I and two younger children (one twelve years old and one thirteen years old, both studying in primary school), becoming only a family of four. Every day it was two congees and one meal with one dish, and life became much simpler. I then gave away most of the one house where we were living. I kept two rooms for myself, and gave the remaining rooms to two relatives to live in, which could reduce a little rent and utility costs. In this way, what used to be a month's expenditure can now sustain three to four months. This is a passive way for me to overcome difficulties in the family.

At that time, many people praised my progressive thinking, on the grounds that I was able to send my children to participate in the revolution at the beginning of liberation. But I am ashamed to say that this matter has nothing to do with progress. I just thought that the future of this great era is bright, and we decided we need to follow it; letting the children participate in the revolution was just for their future prospects. The starting point of this thought: still has a very strong individualism. However, in any case, I always believe that this is a little bit of change in my thinking after liberation.

Last November, it happened to be the seventieth birthday of my fifth uncle, who teaches at Qinghua Middle School in Hangzhou. We wrote many letters to congratulate him. One of my eldest brother's letters had the following sentences:

"We are all unemployed, we are temporarily abandoned by the state... Although we still have to struggle to survive, there are no seats for us at the banquet of the new era! Where do we go from here? Where is our way out?"

My uncle replied to this question in the following way:

"It is a big mistake to say that there are no seats for you at the banquet of the new era. The banquet of the new era has no seats for those who fold their arms and do nothing. If we want to eat ready-made meals with our arms folded, then of course there are no seats. We must first transform ourselves, correct our previous wrong thoughts and habits; start everything from learning; and embrace the purpose of serving the people... There are countless undertakings in society. As long as anything is beneficial to the people, we can participate in it. If you sit at home with your arms folded, waiting for someone to invite you to the banquet, wouldn't it be ridiculous! Or if you first have the view that you will do as much as you are rewarded, then you are committing the error of individualism. Even if you sit at the banquet of the new era, it will be dull... You must know that the People's Government belongs to the people, and the reason why it is different from the Kuomintang is that it has no personal feelings and cancels qualifications; everyone takes action and does things to see. The fundamental difference lies in doing things for others (public interest) and not for oneself (private interest). In fact, serving others is also serving oneself. How can there be a reason why someone who truly serves the people will starve to death? So as long as you embrace this purpose, endure hardship and work hard, study hard, participate in social activities more, there are many ways out everywhere. This is the prerequisite for the seat problem."

These few sentences in this letter gave me an even further change in my thinking. At the time, I thought, yes! Sitting at home waiting for someone to invite you to the banquet is ridiculous! Study hard, participate in social activities more, there are many ways out everywhere! Yes! I also want to learn! I also want to participate in social activities! I can no longer delve into the small circle of housework! At that time, I decided to join the Women's Federation, took on the propaganda work in the neighborhood and the teachers of literacy classes, participated in two study groups; and I had more than one or two negotiations with my husband: I want to share with him the responsibility of handling housework and managing children. Originally, the exclusive responsibility of women to manage the family was a convention created by the feudal era's emphasis on men over women. Even the passage "cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world" in the "Great Learning" refers to men. Then, for the "regulating the family" part, men and women each share half the responsibility, which is also a natural and unbiased request. I should also have a little time to do what I should do, and it is also my right. As a result of the negotiations, my husband was persuaded. Although he also had to go to the study class of the trade union every day, and go to the evening school to make up for accounting, he had not yet found a formal job, and he still had a lot of free time, so he began to learn housework such as washing clothes and cooking, and took on half of the housework. Therefore, I also had half a day to do the work assigned by the Women's Federation; I also had time to study hard; and I could also stipulate two hours of self-study every day. In this way, I re-established the connection with the old friend—books—that I had broken off with for many years, which added a lot to my thinking and understanding. So I think this is another change in my thinking after liberation.

In March of this year, I was sick for more than ten days. While sick, I really wanted to see my children whom I hadn't seen for a long time, so I wrote to ask them to ask for leave to come back for a few days. The reason was: many of their colleagues had already asked for leave to come back; and I said that their lives in the group were very hard, and many people were not in good health, so I wanted them to come back for a few days to recuperate.

My son replied first saying: "We are living very well in the army, and our bodies are also getting stronger. Please don't worry. The army has discipline, and you can't ask for leave casually. Since we have joined the revolutionary work for the sake of the country and for the future, then going home is not so casual! Now is not the time to enjoy the joy of family reunion. When Taiwan is liberated, I will naturally ask for leave to see you. Father! Mother! You must also serve the people well!"

Ah! What a big tone! I was taught a lesson by him!

Two days later, my daughter's reply also came.

She said: "I have been away from home for more than half a year, and I would also like to come back once. But my work needs me, and my sense of responsibility does not allow me. Now I am working in one village alone. The farmers' association has just been organized, and now it is carrying out the work of organizing women and catching insects. It is really impossible to leave without reason for a day. You want me to ask for leave to come back, just because you want to see me; you are afraid that I am having a hard life outside, and I can be comfortable for a few days when I return home; at most, you want to get some good things to eat to treat me. But here our cadres are already eating very well. I see that most of the people in the countryside eat cornmeal balls and wild vegetables; the better ones eat pumpkin as rice, without any oil. We already feel very ashamed; if we ask for leave to go home to enjoy a few days, we can't get over our conscience. Mother! You have already participated in learning, and participated in social service, why can't you get your thinking straight? I think this is because you have not completely understood the principle of 'walking the mass line'!"

Oh dear! I ran into another snag! I was taught another lesson by my daughter! It really made me angry, and I really regretted writing to ask them.

But, after thinking carefully, what they said was indeed all correct, and the mistake was still with myself. I wanted them to come back because my own petty-bourgeois inferiority complex was acting up. My son wanted me to serve the people well, and my daughter wanted me to thoroughly walk the mass line. They both understood much more than I did. I am also busy all day long, and I think I can be innocent, but they said that my thinking is not clear. This time I really received a major stimulus. I also want to serve the people! I also want to walk the mass line! I want to win this tone!

At the end of March, I joined the third training class of the cooperative organized by the Democratic Women's Federation, going to the YMCA on Xizang Road every other day to listen to lectures, and discussing in small group meetings the next day. It ended after a month and a half of study. Then I served as a member of the Red May competition work promotion team of the Beihong District Women's Cooperative, carrying out neighborhood work every day—promoting the cooperative's affairs; and serving as a writer for the neighborhood wall newspaper. It is still continuing today.

It's hateful that my physical strength is too poor. After working every day, I always have dizziness and back pain, and I am exhausted. But I am happy in spirit, and the future is bright. I am now also serving the people! I am also walking the mass line! At first, I encouraged the children to participate in revolutionary work, and now the children are encouraging me in return. So I think this is the third ideological transformation after liberation.

In short, my thinking in this year has indeed undergone several major changes. But now I review the degree of change myself: I feel that there are still too many shortcomings, and my thinking has not reached a sound state; both work and study are not active enough; many old habits have not been fundamentally transformed. I have only done being willing to serve the people but have not done wholeheartedly serving the people. In this year, the changes in thinking are only quantitative changes, and have not reached a fundamental qualitative change. Cold water has indeed become hot water, but it has not yet approached the boiling point. In the future, I need to redouble my efforts! Learn! Forward! I believe that a fundamental and sudden qualitative change can eventually come.

### 孩子们鼓励我进步

　　孩子们鼓励我进步
　　王绛文
    这篇文章原载六月二十九日上海新闻日报《解放一年来我的思想转变》的征文栏。作者王绛文女士是一位三十九岁的家庭妇女。在这篇文章中，她生动地叙述了在上海解放以后自己的思想转变过程。
    ——编者
    我是一个已经三十九岁的家庭妇女。从小在家塾里面读过几年书，读的是四书五经之类的书籍。到十六岁上才算正式进了学校，中学还没有毕业，在二十岁那年，就由父母之命、媒妁之言同一家老亲姓姚的结了婚。婚后的开始几年，倒也当过两年小学教师。后来接连生了两个孩子，为了照顾孩子、管理家事，就把起初要为社会服务的志愿，无形的打消了。我一共生育过八次，现在还留存得两男两女；其他四个孩子，有的管到五六岁，有的到十岁左右，都络续的因病死去。在这十几年当中，生孩子、死孩子，接连不断，把十几年的光阴，全都抛掷在生养孩子、看护孩子的身上，简直终年累月忙得喘不过气来。一切社会上的活动，也从没有工夫去参加；和书本子也从此绝了缘；就是每天的报纸，也至多不过看上几行大标题。真真成了一个旧式家庭的典型妇女。
    我的知识可以算是一个半新半旧的女子。从小的理想，也认为妇女是应当自立谋生，依靠男子是可耻的。是损失了自己的人格。所以在结婚以后，不听翁姑和丈夫的劝阻，去担任了一个小学教员。不料仅仅只有两年，环境不许可我，因为要照管儿女，只好把事业半途而废。弄得事与愿违，理想终究是理想，我一直到解放以前，我终于还是成了一个依赖男子的妇女。
    但是我对于管理家务上面，却也是尽了不少的责任。一家老的老、小的小，十余人的生活，都要我一人照料。虽则也雇用了一两个佣人，我还是忙得整天不得空。我当时的思想，确也是受了当时的社会意识的支配：男子对外、女子治内，各司其事，各得其所；真能负责管理家政的妇女，真能做到了贤妻良母，决不能给她戴上一个社会寄生虫的帽子。我当时就拿这一种落后的见解来聊以自慰。
    我丈夫在证券交易所当了十余年的职员，待遇也很好，他没有一点嗜好，每月收入多拿回家来。所以我们一家，一直过着一个还算宽裕的中等家庭的生活。我虽然家务忙一点，可是在经济上从没有受过什么重大的困难。
    去年上海解放了，证券交易所封闭了，我家的最大打击，是我丈夫失了业；也是我一生所遭到的第一次的平地风波。从此生活是没有保障了。失业使我发生了困难，尝受了痛苦；可是失业却帮助了我思想上有了第一次的转变。
    在解放的前后，反动派所造的许多谣言，我倒绝对的没有相信过。因为我当时所接近的人，倒有许多是前进分子，平日很听到一些新知识的理论：关于共产党领导革命的认识，也还有一点大致的轮廓。不过这一点认识，还幼稚、浅薄得很，仅仅只是能够对革命表示同情而已。当时认为这革命还需要一个很长的时期——对共产党的发展前途，反动派的完全消灭，我还没有坚确的信心。我也知道一个大时代的转变，在过渡时期、人人都要受到而且应当要受到相当的困难。不过当时不认为这困难是暂时的，而是认为这困难是长期的；也就认为个人的失业，当然也是长期的了。为了要准备长期克服困难起见，我首先对于我家维持生计的办法，确定了长期克服困难的方针。
    第一步先从勤俭二字入手——由节省支出减少人口入手。请我的公公住到了我的夫弟那边，他那里比较宽裕一点，饮食上比较好一点，因为老年人不能太吃苦。家中解雇了两个佣人，一切多由自己操作。大女儿瑞麟今年十九岁，去年暑假在松江女子高中毕业，那时她要去当家庭教师，可以对家里有些补助，但我一力主张叫她去投考革大，录取后学习了四个月，分派到桐乡县去做乡村工作。一直服务到现在。大儿子大匠，今年十六岁，在上海职业学校初中三年级，去年七月间，我也叫他去加入了三野第九兵团的文工队。现在调在杭州服务。这样，我家就只剩了我们夫妇二人和两个小的孩子（一个十二岁，一个十三岁，都在小学读书），仅成了一个四口之家。每天是两粥一饭一菜，生活上就简单多了。再把住的一幢房子。自己留用了两间，余多的分给了两家亲戚来住，可以减少一点房租和水电费用。这样，以前一个月的开支，现在可以维持三四个月了。这是我对家庭克服困难的一种消极的办法。
    当时就有许多人称赞我的思想前进，理由是居然在解放之初，就能把儿女送去参加革命。但是惭愧得很，这事根本谈不到前进，不过我认为这大时代的前途是光明的，我们决定需要跟着它走；叫儿女去参加革命，也不过是为了他们的前途出路而已。这思想的出发点：还是有很浓厚的个人主义。然而无论如何，我总认为这是在解放后我思想上的一点转变。
    去年十一月间，适逢我五叔父的七十岁诞辰，他在杭州清华中学教书，我们多写信去给他祝寿。我大哥的一封信上有这样的几句：
    “我们都失了业，我们被国家暂时的遗弃了。……我们虽是仍旧要挣扎着生存下去，但是新时代的大筵会上已经没有我们的座位了！此后我们走向那里去？那里是我们的出路呢？”
    我叔父回信上是这样的答复了这个问题：
    “所云新时代的大筵会没有你们的座位，这是大错的观念。新时代的筵会是没有拱手不做事的人的座位。我们如想拱手吃现成饭，那是当然没有座位的。我们首先要改造自己，改正以前错误的思想和习惯；一切从学习入手；抱定为人群服务的宗旨。……社会上的事业，多得不胜枚举。只要对人民有利益的任何事情都可以去参加。如果你拱手坐在家里，要等人家来请你赴筵会，岂不可笑！或是你先存着有了多少报酬才做多少事的观点，那就是犯了个人主义的错误。就是坐上了新时代的筵会，也必是索然无味。……要知道人民政府是人民的，其所以异于国民党者：在毫无情面、取消资格；大家拿出手来做，做出来看。其根本不同之点：在为他人（公益）并不是为自己（私利）。实在为他人也就是为自己，天下那有真正肯为人民服务的人而自己会饿死的道理？所以只要抱定这个宗旨，吃苦耐劳，好好学习，多多参加社会活动，随处多是出路。这也就是座位问题的先决条件。”
    这封信上的这几句话，竟给予了我思想上更进一步的转变。当时，我想，是的！坐在家里等人来请赴筵会岂不可笑！好好学习，多多参加社会活动，随处多是出路！对呀！我也要学习！我也要参加社会活动！我不能再钻在家务劳动的小圈子里面了！那时我就决定加入了家庭妇联，担任了里弄宣传工作和识字班的教员，参加了两处学习小组；并且和我丈夫开了不止一两次的谈判：我要和他分负处理家务管教儿女的责任。本来妇女管家的专职，原是封建时代重男轻女所造成的惯例。就是“大学”上“修身齐家治国平天下”的一段话，也都是指的男子而言。那末“齐家”的部分，男女各分一半责任，也是天公地道、两无偏差的要求。我也应当有一点时间做我所应做的事，而且也是我的权利。谈判的结果，我丈夫被我说服了。他虽也每天要去参加总工会的学习班，晚上要到业余学校补习会计，但是他还没有找到正式职业，空闲的时间也还多，于是他就开始学习洗衣煮饭等家事劳动，分任了一半的家务。因此我也有了半天工夫，做妇联所分派的工作；也有了好好学习的时间；每天还能规定两小时的自修学习。这样，和我多年断绝关系的旧交——书本子——从复又结上了缘，这对我思想上认识上增加了不少的帮助。所以我认为这是解放以后我思想上又一次的转变。
    今年三月间，我病了十多天，病中很想见见我久别了的儿女，就写信去要他们请假回来几天。理由是：他们的同事多已请假回来过；而且说起他们在团体里面生活很苦，许多人身体都不大好，所以我要他们回来休养几天。
    儿子先来了回信说：“我们军队里生活过得很好，身体也锻炼得结实了，请不必挂念。军队是有纪律的，不能随便请假。既然为了国家，为了前途，参加了革命工作，那末回家就没有那么随便！现在还不到享受家庭团聚之乐的时候。等台湾解放了，我自然会请假来看你们的。父亲！母亲！你们也要好好的为人民服务呀！”
    啊！好大口气！我倒受了他一顿教训！
    过了两天，女儿的回信也来了。
    她说：“我离家半年多，也很愿意回来一次。可是我的工作需要我，我的责任心不允许我。现在我一个人担任一个村子的工作，农会刚刚组织好，现在正在进行组织妇女和捕虫的工作，实在一天也不能无故离开。你要我请假回来，无非是想要看看我；怕我在外面生活苦，回到家里可以舒服几天；再不过是弄点好吃的东西来请请我。但是在此地我们干部吃的已经很好。我看到乡下人大都吃的是糠团子和野菜；较好的南瓜当饭，一点油也没有，我们已经觉得惭愧得很；再要请假回家来享受几天，良心上也说不过去。母亲！你已经参加了学习，参加了社会服务，为什么思想还搞不通呢？我想这还是你对于‘走群众路线’的一层道理还没有彻底地弄明白吧！”
    啊呀！我又碰了一个钉子！又受了女儿的一番教训！真把我气得要命，我真后悔写信去叫他们的。
    但是，我仔细一想，他们的话确实都没有错，错误的还是我自己。我要他们回来，是我自己小资产阶级的劣根性在那里作怪。儿子要叫我好好的为人民服务，女儿要叫我彻底地走群众路线，他们都比我懂得多了。我一天到晚也忙得可以，自以为是可以问心无愧了，他们竟说我思想没有搞通。这次我真是受了一个重大的刺激。我也要为人民服务！也要走群众路线！我要争这口气！
    我就在三月底参加了民主妇联组织的合作社第三期的训练班，每隔一天到西藏路青年会去听讲，次日开小组会讨论。经过一个半月的学习才结束了。接着我担任了北虹区妇女合作社红五月竞赛的工作推进队队员，每天进行里弄工作——推动合作社的社务工作；并担任为里弄壁报上写稿的工作。如今还在继续着。
    可恨我体力太差，每天工作后，回家来总是头眩腰痛、疲惫不堪。但是我精神上是快乐的，前途是光明的。我现在也在为人民服务了！也在走群众路线了！当初我鼓励了孩子们去参加革命工作，现在反过来孩子们来鼓励了我。所以我认为这次是在解放以后我的第三期思想上的转变。
    总之，我这一年来的思想，确是起了几次很大的转变。可是我现在把转变后的程度来自我检讨一下：就自己感觉到还是缺点太多，思想还没有进到健全的境地；工作和学习都还不够积极；许多旧习惯还没有根本的改造。仅仅做到肯为人民服务而没有做到全心全意的为人民服务。这一年来思想上不过是起着几次量的变化，还没有到根本上质的变化。冷水确是已经变了热水，但是还没有接近沸点。今后我需要加倍的努力！学习！向前！我相信根本上突然的质的变化终究是可以来临的。
