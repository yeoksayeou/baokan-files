　　Blind Planning Leads to Losses
　　A Self-Criticism by Li Zhanshan of Zhangjiakou Water Company

To the Editor:

　　The Zhangjiakou Water Company recently began constructing a retaining dam in July, according to the third-quarter work plan, to protect the main pipeline. Forty-three workers were employed, five bags of cement were used, and 1,500 catties of lime were used. After seven days of work, just as it was about to be completed, it was suddenly washed away by a flood on July 18th. Even the foundation was overturned, and the pipe was almost broken, resulting in a loss equivalent to 8,455 catties of millet. The reasons for this loss are: (1) The engineering construction plan was blind. Originally, this project to protect the main pipeline was necessary, but it should have been built in the first quarter before the rainy season. We suffered a loss from repairing the river dam last year, but we still did not learn from this experience this year. (2) There is bureaucracy in the leadership. The plan was originally discussed and approved by the Management Committee, but it was just planning for the sake of planning, and each member did not carefully consider the specific issues. I am also a member of the committee. Looking back, I was too unconcerned about the production plan in the past. (3) There was procrastination in the work, and we did not concentrate our efforts. For such a small project, we should have concentrated our efforts to complete it quickly during the rainy season, but we worked on it for six days and finally suffered a loss. This experience and lesson should be well received, and we should continue to examine our other work plans and overcome blindness in the plans, in order to improve our entire work.

### 盲目计划造成损失  张市自来水公司李占山的自我检讨

　　盲目计划造成损失
    张市自来水公司李占山的自我检讨编辑同志：
    张家口市自来水公司最近按照第三季工作计划，在七月份开始修筑挡水坝，为了保护干管，用工四十三个，使用洋灰五袋，用白灰一千五百斤，修了七天，将要完成时，在七月十八日忽然被洪水冲垮，连地基都被冲翻，管子也几乎被冲断，白白损失小米八千四百五十五斤。造成此次损失的原因：（一）工程建筑计划盲目。本来这个保护干管工程是需要的，但应当在雨季前第一季工作中修建。去年修河坝已遭到一次损失但今年还没有接受这个经验教训。（二）领导上存在官僚主义。本来计划是通过管委会讨论过的，但是只为计划而计划，每个委员都没有细心考虑具体问题。我也是一个委员，检查起来过去对生产计划太不关心。（三）在工作中拖拉，没有集中使用力量，像这样很小的一个工程，在雨季应当集中力量突击完成，结果做了六天，最后遭到损失。这一经验教训应当很好接受，并继续检查我们其他的工作计划，克服计划中的盲目性，以此来改进我们整个的工作。
