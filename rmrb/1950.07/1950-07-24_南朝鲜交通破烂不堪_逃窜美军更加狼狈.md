　　South Korea's Broken Down Transportation
    Fleeing American Troops Even More Humiliated

    [Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd] According to a report from the Korean front on the 16th by Agence France-Presse correspondent Du Bólún, the backward material conditions of South Korea caused by imperialism and its running dogs are now becoming another major "enemy" of the American aggressors. Here, the aggressors' "heavy artillery gets stuck in the rice paddies, and startled water buffalo delay tank columns for valuable time."
    Du Bólún wrote: "In Korea, forty years of Japanese occupation did not bring modernization." What he did not explain was that after the Japanese, the five years of heinous rule by American imperialism and its running dog, Syngman Rhee, in southern Korea still did not bring "modernization." Moreover, the transportation in southern Korea has been rendered so dilapidated and decayed that it is beyond repair. Therefore, Du Bólún said, "Tanks driving towards the front seem to be floating in a dense cloud of dust, and nothing can be seen. Sometimes, these tanks have to push Korean (referring to the Syngman Rhee puppet army) trucks into the ditch. The tanks are too heavy, and the bridges cannot bear the weight, so they have to carry bridges with them. The airfields built for outdated fighter planes are crushed by the thousands of wheels of American planes participating in the airlift. On the long-neglected railways, crowded and disappointingly slow Korean military trains. These trains have to stop for a few minutes in every small village; and at Busan, the main American supply station, troop trains have to spend several hours waiting for the green light signal to direct traffic."
    The dilapidated transportation in southern Korea is a major problem for the American troops fleeing south in disarray. Du Bólún said, "On the narrow roads leading down from the front, American officers are forcing farmers to abandon their water buffalo" and drive them off the main road, so that American artillery and trailers can escape the pursuit of the Korean People's Army's fierce artillery fire.
    Although Du Bólún attempts to use "poor transportation conditions" to excuse the failure of the American troops, he reveals the fact that the "modernized" but demoralized American bandits, in the absence of "modernized" conditions, appear so paralyzed, helpless, and flustered.

### 南朝鲜交通破烂不堪  逃窜美军更加狼狈

　　南朝鲜交通破烂不堪
    逃窜美军更加狼狈
    【新华社二十三日讯】据法新社记者杜勃伦十六日从朝鲜前线报道，帝国主义及其走狗所造成的南朝鲜落后的物质条件，现在也成了美国侵略者的另一个主要“敌人”。在这里，侵略者的“重炮会陷在稻田里，吃惊的水牛会使坦克纵队耽误了宝贵的时间”。
    杜勃伦写道：“在朝鲜这里，日本人四十年的占领并没有带来现代化。”他所没有说明的是，在日本人之后，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚在朝鲜南部为时五年的罪恶统治，仍然没有带来“现代化”。而且，朝鲜南部的交通，已被弄得破烂腐朽到不堪的程度。因此，杜勃伦说，“向前线开驶的坦克，好像浮腾在尘土所造成的密云里，什么东西也看不见。有时，这些坦克不得不把朝鲜（指李承晚伪军）的卡车挤到沟里去。坦克太重，桥是吃不住的，因此，不能不随身携带桥梁。为过了时的战斗机建造的飞机场，被参加空运的美机的几千个轮子压得粉碎。在年久失修的铁路上，拥挤着慢得令人失望的朝鲜军用火车。这些火车在每个小村落都要停几分钟；而在美军主要的供应站釜山，兵车却要花好几个钟头来等待指挥行车的绿灯信号。”
    朝鲜南部破烂不堪的交通，对向南狼狈溃逃的美军是一个大难题，杜勃伦说，“在从前线下来的狭窄的道路上，美国军官们正在强迫农民丢下他们的水牛”，并把他们赶出大路，以便让美军的大炮和拖车能够逃出朝鲜人民军猛烈炮火的追击。
    尽管杜勃伦企图拿“交通条件不良”来为美军的失败辩解，但他却道出了这样的事实，即：装备“现代化”的，但毫无斗志的美国强盗们，在没有“现代化”条件的情况下，是显得多么瘫痪无力，狼狈周章。
