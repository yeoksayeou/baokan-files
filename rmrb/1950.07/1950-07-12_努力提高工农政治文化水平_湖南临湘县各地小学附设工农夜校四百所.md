　　Strive to Improve the Political and Cultural Level of Workers and Peasants
    400 Workers' and Peasants' Night Schools Attached to Primary Schools in Linxiang County, Hunan
    [Hunan Linxiang News] In order to popularize rural education, Linxiang County piloted public night schools in Liulin Township, Fourth District, last fall, and gained preliminary experience. During the winter vacation, ideological mobilization was carried out in the teacher training class, calling on all teachers to carry out the worker and peasant literacy movement. In this term, workers' and peasants' night schools are generally attached to primary schools in various places. Through the Farmers' Association, publicity is carried out among the masses to mobilize workers, peasants and their children to enroll. According to statistics before June 10, 413 workers' and peasants' night schools have been established in the county, with a total of 13,670 workers, peasants and their children participating in the study. The teaching policy of the night school is to provide appropriate education according to different levels. The teaching materials include the Farmers' Political Textbook (uniformly stipulated by the Changsha Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China), the Farmers' Cultural Textbook (published by Xinhua Bookstore), and the Construction Daily (a newspaper led by the Prefectural Committee). In order to make it easier for students to accept, the teachers compiled the Farmer's Political Textbook into a song formula of three characters and one sentence, which has been sent to the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee for review and approval for application. Because the teachers can get in touch with the masses and teach conscientiously, the students are very enthusiastic about learning. For example, there are 22 night schools in Baiyang Village, Fourth District. More than 35% of the total population of the village, both adults and minors, men and women, participate in the study. Grandma Yuan Qi, who is over seventy years old and blind, still attends night school to listen to lectures. Women Lan Yuying, Liao Guiyuan, etc., who did not know a word in the past, can now write very good characters. Each night school can generally insist on studying for one and a half to two hours every night. Night schools not only improve the cultural level of workers and peasants, but also closely integrate with the central work of the government, publicize rent reduction and the ten production policies promulgated by the Central South Military and Political Committee.

　　努力提高工农政治文化水平
    湖南临湘县各地小学附设工农夜校四百所
    【湖南临湘讯】临湘县为了普及农村教育，于去年下期在四区柳林乡试办了民众夜校，取得了初步经验。寒假中，又在教员讲习班上进行了思想动员，号召全体教员开展工农识字运动。本期各地小学普遍附设了工农夜校，并通过农民协会在群众中进行宣传，动员工农群众入学。据六月十日以前统计，全县已成立工农夜校四百一十三所，参加学习的工人、农民和工农子女共一万三千六百七十人。夜校的教学方针是根据不同程度施以适当教育，教材有农民政治课本（由中共长沙地委统一规定的）、农民文化课本（新华书店出版）及建设报（地委领导的报纸）等。为了使学员容易接受，教师们把农民政治课本编成一本三字一句的歌诀，已送地委宣传部审查批准应用。由于教员能和群众取得联系，教学认真，学生学习情绪很高。如四区白羊村共有夜校二十二所，全村总人口百分之三十五以上的成年及未成年男女，都参加了学习。七十多岁的袁七妈，瞎了眼睛，还上夜校听课。妇女蓝玉英、廖桂元等，过去一字不识，现在能写得很好的字了。各夜校一般每晚都能坚持一点半钟到两点钟的学习。夜校不仅提高了工人、农民的文化水平，而且紧紧结合了政府的中心工作，宣传了减租和中南军政委员会颁布的生产十大政策。
