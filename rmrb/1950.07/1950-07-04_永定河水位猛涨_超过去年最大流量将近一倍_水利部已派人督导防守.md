　　Yongding River Water Level Rises Sharply
	Exceeds Last Year's Maximum Flow by Nearly Double
	Ministry of Water Resources Dispatches Personnel to Supervise Defense
[This newspaper's dispatch] On June 30th, the Yongding River's water level rose sharply. The water level at Guanting in the upper reaches reached 443.28 meters (above the Dagukou sea level datum) at 6:00 AM, 444.00 meters at 8:00 PM, and 445.13 meters at 8:30 PM, only 0.37 meters from the danger level. On the same day, the water level at Lugou Bridge in the lower reaches reached 61.6 meters at 2:00 PM, 63.2 meters at 5:00 PM, and continued to rise to 63.22 meters at 6:00 AM on July 1st. It dropped slightly at 7:00 AM, and the water level fell to 62.88 meters at 8:00 AM. The peak flow of this flood has exceeded 1,000 cubic meters per second, nearly double the maximum flow of last year. The Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has issued an emergency flood control notice overnight, and the masses along the river have gone to the dikes to patrol and defend. The Ministry of Water Resources dispatched Liu Zhongrui, Director of the Engineering Affairs Department, along with two technical cadres, to the Yongding River Water Conservancy Bureau at 8:00 AM on July 1st to assist in supervising the defense. The suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin Prefecture have dispatched cadres to the dikes. The Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Government, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, Director of the Suburban Committee, and Secretary of the Suburban Committee of the Communist Party, as well as the Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Prefecture and the Minister of the Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party, personally went to inspect and provide leadership. Currently, all dike sections are actively preparing materials to prepare for rescue efforts. This rise in water has exposed the Yongding River's inadequate flood control organization, low level of vigilance, and poor communication between upstream and downstream areas. Except for the timely communication between Guanting and Lugou Bridge, communication with other counties along the river has not yet been established, and dike inspections are not thorough enough. Some road openings through the dikes have not been blocked, and there are four places where the water level is only 30-40 centimeters from the openings, posing a risk of overflow if the water continues to rise. These issues should be given high vigilance, and thorough inspections should be carried out to quickly make all preparations in order to fight the flood more proactively.

　　永定河水位猛涨
    超过去年最大流量将近一倍       
    水利部已派人督导防守
    【本报讯】六月三十日永定河河水猛涨，上游官厅水位自六时起水位已达四四三．二八公尺（高出大沽海平面），二十时涨至四四四．○○公尺，二十时三十分涨至四四五．一三公尺，距危险水位仅差○．三七公尺。同日下游芦沟桥水位十四时涨至六一．六公尺，十七时涨至六三．二公尺，七月一日六时续涨至六三．二二公尺，七时稍落，八时水位落至六二．八八公尺。此次洪水峰已超过一千秒公方。超过去年最大流量将近一倍。河北省防汛总指挥部已星夜发出防汛紧急通知，沿河各地群众已上堤巡逻防守。中央水利部于七月一日八时派工务司刘钟瑞司长，偕同技术干部二人，驰赴永定河河务局协助督导防守。北京市郊区、天津专区均派干部赶赴河堤。北京市府秘书长、中共市委副书记、郊委会主任、中共郊委会书记等及天津专署副专员、中共地委组织部长并亲往视察领导，现各堤段正积极备料，准备抢险。这次涨水，暴露了永定河防汛组织不够严密，警惕性不高，上下游的联络较差，除官厅至芦沟桥的联络尚能及时外，其余各沿河县的联络还未建立，堤防检查还不深入，有的穿堤道口未予堵塞，水位距道口仅只三、四公寸的有四处，若再续涨，便有漫溢危险。这些均应引起高度警惕，并进行深入检查，迅速作好一切准备工作，以便更主动的与洪水斗争。
