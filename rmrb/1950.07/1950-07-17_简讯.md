            Gaocheng County Dredges Zhouhan River
    The Zhouhan River's Gaocheng section is narrow and winding, and due to years of wind and silt accumulation, the riverbed is shallow. This section has suffered from floods in recent years, and local people urgently requested the dredging of the river. The county people's government seized the time, taking advantage of the current dry season with little water, to dredge the river. Mobilizing more than 10,000 people, they dug eighteen li of river and built two new embankments in four days. This autumn, it will be possible to produce an additional 10,000 shi of grain.
