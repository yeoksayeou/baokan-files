Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: Vast numbers of young students in the yet-to-be-liberated Jeolla Province of South Korea, disregarding the enemy's various persecutions, are actively supporting the People's Army's southward advance and the guerrillas' activities, and are constantly exposing the Syngman Rhee puppet group's false "war reports," conducting extensive propaganda among the people. The Syngman Rhee puppet group has issued cries of "students of major universities and schools are inciting the people's hearts," and they have mobilized reactionary police to carry out frantic suppression, attempting to salvage the lost popular support.

The American newspaper *New York Post* also had to admit on the 6th, when mentioning the Korean situation, that the Syngman Rhee puppet government has been finally abandoned by the South Korean people, and that the South Korean people are actively supporting the guerrilla war against the American puppet government. In mentioning the enthusiastic efforts of all Korean people to reunify their divided fatherland, the newspaper admitted that the Korean people living in the southern part of the country all believe that this reunification can only come from the North. The *New York Post* concluded: American armed intervention has violently struck the South Korean people, therefore, there are many reasons to expect that the United States will be met with the widespread hostility of the Korean people, rather than their heroic support.

　　南朝鲜人民迎接统一
    热烈支援人民军及游击队
    李承晚傀儡政权已被人民最后唾弃
    【新华社平壤八日电】待解放的南朝鲜全罗南道境内的广大青年学生，不顾敌人的各种迫害，正积极支援人民军的南进与游击队的活动，并不断揭露李承晚傀儡集团虚伪的“战报”，对人民群众进行广泛的宣传。李承晚傀儡集团发出了“各大、中学校的学生煽动人心”的悲鸣，他们动员反动警察进行疯狂的镇压，妄图挽回已失去了的人心。
    美国报纸《纽约邮报》于六日在提到朝鲜局势时，也不得不承认李承晚傀儡政府已最后被南朝鲜人民所抛弃，南朝鲜人民正积极支持反对美国傀儡政府的游击战。在提到全朝鲜人民热情努力重新统一他们被分裂的祖国时，该报承认居住在该国南部的朝鲜人民，都相信这种重新统一只能来自北方。《纽约邮报》末称：美国武装干涉猛力打击了南朝鲜的老百姓，因此，有很多理由可以预料，美国将受到朝鲜人民的普遍敌视，而不是他们的英勇支持。
