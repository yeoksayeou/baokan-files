Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 1st: The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army and the land, sea, and air forces stationed in East China have expressed great anger at Truman's arrogant provocation of sending the Seventh Fleet to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. Commanders and fighters have written letters of determination and submitted them to the military and political leaders of their respective units, expressing their warm support for Chairman Mao's call and Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement, vowing to fight resolutely for the liberation of Taiwan with full preparation. Wei Laiguo, a shooting hero of East China from a certain unit, said: "The provocation of American imperialism cannot intimidate the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army. In the great victory of completely annihilating the more than five million Kuomintang reactionary troops equipped entirely with American weapons, the People's Liberation Army has long been fully aware that American imperialism is a paper tiger that appears strong but is weak. We have the confidence and the strength to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan." Commanders and fighters pointed to the American-made weapons seized from the Kuomintang reactionaries and said: "This is the proof that we can defeat any aggressive action by American imperialism." Taiwan natives in a certain army corps also held a meeting. Their letter of determination stated: "Taiwan is our hometown, it is our Chinese territory. We will not allow American imperialism to have any aggression against Taiwan. We are determined to fight for the liberation of our hometown." Commanders and fighters from the naval and air force units also held symposiums, unanimously expressing their intention to respond to the shameless provocation of American imperialism by intensifying military training, and guaranteeing to all land army commanders and fighters that they would resolutely and fully cooperate with their victorious advance towards Taiwan. He Zongrong, a model worker in a certain factory of the Logistics Department, and Jiang Peihua, a female hero who protects the factory, said: We are determined to step up production and actively support the People's Liberation Army's advance into Taiwan to combat the aggression conspiracy of American imperialists.
