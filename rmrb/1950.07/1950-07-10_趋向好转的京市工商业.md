　　The Improving Industry and Commerce of Beijing
　　By our reporter Lin Hong

　　I. The Difficult Situation Has Been Reversed

　　Under the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, Beijing's private industry and commerce has passed through its most difficult period and is beginning to take a turn for the better. Although the time has been only a short three months or so, the facts have proven that the implementation of Chairman Mao's policy of adjusting industry and commerce has achieved great results in Beijing, as in many other parts of the country.

　　March and April of this year were the most difficult period for Beijing's industrial and commercial circles. In commerce, the number of applications to open versus close businesses in March was 262 versus 372; in April, it changed to 236 versus 738, with closures more than doubling openings. According to the opening and closing statistics from the Industry Bureau, industry saw more openings than closures in these two months, but in reality, most of the new businesses were small, while many large factories were either at a standstill or suffering from serious product stagnation. At this time, some industrialists and businessmen lost confidence, believing that such huge difficulties were insurmountable. However, before long, the difficult situation was reversed: market transaction volume increased, some of the suspended operations resumed production, and the number of commercial openings exceeded closures, with even more than forty shops that had applied to close reopening for business. Comparing the transaction volume of major market commodities in May with that of March, flour increased by 22.5%, coarse and fine grains increased by 15.6%, and cloth increased by 160%. As for commercial openings and closures, starting in early June, closures decreased to 88 households, while openings numbered 99; after mid-June, openings increased to 123 households, and closures decreased to 52, with openings exceeding closures by 70%.

　　II. The Promoting Role of the Work Teams

　　The gradual improvement of Beijing's industry and commerce in May was mainly due to the gradual recovery of real purchasing power in the market, the joint efforts of labor and management, and the correct implementation of the People's Government's policy of adjusting industry and commerce. Like many places across the country, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has successively adopted a series of measures, among which the working group for adjusting industry and commerce, led by the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, played a promoting role in the adjustment of industry and commerce. Generally speaking, the work team carried out work in three aspects during the period of more than two months. First, it selected some typical factories and shops with emphasis to help resolve labor-management disputes, and then establish labor-management consultation meetings. The factories and shops selected by the work team generally had more problems and were more universal. For example, in the knitting industry, the largest Yuhua Cotton Weaving Factory had very disunited labor and management, which caused losses to production. After the work team conducted in-depth understanding of the situation and provided various mediation assistance, the labor-management relationship has become normal. The enthusiasm of the capital side to manage has increased, and the labor side has actively produced, so that the output has increased by 15% compared with the past, and the defective rate has been greatly reduced. The capital side of Hongxingde Grain Store had concerns, and the labor side had excessive demands, which caused the originally profitable business to come to a standstill. After the work team properly resolved the labor-management dispute, the capital side was willing to reinvest and continue operating. After solving several similar problems, it had a good demonstration effect on general labor-management relations issues. The heads of guilds in the weaving and dyeing, knitting and other industries believed that the labor-management relations in their respective industries were much better than before. Second, the work team helped various factories to undertake processing, ordering, and raw material exchange of finished products, so that industries that relied solely on processing, ordering, or product stagnation could continue production. Industries such as iron, weaving and dyeing, knitting, cigarettes, and matches have all received a batch of processing, ordering, or sold some finished products through the introduction of the work team. Third, the work team assisted various factories in improving production technology in order to improve product quality and reduce costs; it focused on solving the supply of raw materials and unified sales of finished products, so that certain industries gradually achieved planned production and sales. With the assistance of the work team, the Iron Industry Processing and Ordering Management Committee has now been established, and in the future, the association will uniformly absorb and distribute processing and ordering tasks, and help various factories overcome the phenomenon of product non-compliance caused by poor technology and incomplete equipment. The machine-made cigarette industry has established a technical improvement committee, which mainly has three tasks: (1) To divide finished products into several grades, and provide guidance on production technology in order to overcome the phenomenon that the finished products were sometimes good and sometimes bad, which affected sales in the past; (2) To uniformly supply raw materials with emphasis, so that the phenomenon that the supply of raw materials could not keep up with production or the sudden rise in raw materials affected costs could be gradually overcome. Now the Beijing Wine Industry Monopoly Branch Company has agreed to establish an agency to specialize in the supply of raw materials; (3) According to the current possible sales market for Beijing machine-made cigarettes, uniformly allocate the production quantity of finished products for each factory, and the sales group under the association is responsible for sales. As for the finished products manufactured by various factories in addition to the allocated quantity, each factory is responsible for its own sales.

　　III. Strong Support from National Financial and Economic Organs

　　During the period when the working group for adjusting industry and commerce was carrying out its work, various state-owned trading organs, tax bureaus, and the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China also made many achievements in adjusting public-private relations. From April to June, the quantity of yarn exchanged for cloth by the cotton yarn and cloth branch accounted for about 53% of the total products of the weaving and dyeing industry; the department store branch acquired and exchanged products such as towels, socks, cigarettes, and rubber soles, worth more than 10.5 billion yuan. The results of the state-owned trading organs adjusting prices, abolishing some retail companies, restricting the types of retail commodities, and holding up brand-name prices have expanded the sales scope of private commerce, increased sales volume, and made it profitable for general industries. Taking May as an example, private merchants sold 81.96% of the total market grain transaction volume, 55.26% of flour, and 94.4% of cloth. The tax bureau took care of those households with arrears in industrial and commercial taxes in the second half of last year who were indeed in difficulty. As of the end of May, it was decided to reduce, exempt, and postpone payments for more than 2,500 households, totaling more than 2.85 billion yuan in taxes. At the same time, the tax bureau also changed the method of taxation within the scope of possibility. For example, the goods tax of the machine-made cigarette industry was originally paid on the day the finished products left the factory; now it has been changed to once every ten days. This has been of great help to various factories. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China lent more than 8.2 billion yuan to private industrial and commercial households in April and May, and further expanded the scope of loans in June, lending a total of more than 9.6 billion yuan, exceeding the total loan amount of the previous two months by 17%.

　　IV. Industrialists and Businessmen Must Continue to Work Hard

　　Although Beijing's private industry and commerce has begun to improve today, and the People's Government will continue to implement the policy of adjusting industry and commerce in order to strive for fundamental improvement, there are still many areas that private industry and commerce itself needs to improve, especially to improve business policies and methods, and overcome conservative and backward views. In the past period, many factories and shops have achieved considerable results in changing business policies, streamlining institutions, and reducing redundant personnel through the joint efforts of labor and management, especially industry in improving the quantity and quality of products. But in general, high cost and poor quality are still a common problem in private industry. How to change the business policy to be more suitable for the needs of the broad masses of the people, especially the broad masses of farmers, and how to improve technology, improve quality, and reduce costs are the directions that private enterprises must strive for. In June, Yichang Factory in the iron industry processed a batch of sprayer parts for the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, but because the factory did not improve its own technology, the finished products made were not up to standard. In March of this year, Hengdecheng Weaving Factory had only more than 30 workers in the whole factory, but there were 17 or 18 staff members, and the monthly salary of the staff members was half more than the wages of the workers. Therefore, only by changing the business policy and the old business methods can the future be bright!

　　趋向好转的京市工商业
    本报记者  林洪
    一、困难局面扭转过来了
    在北京市人民政府的正确领导下，京市私营工商业已度过了最困难的时期，开始走上好转的道路。时间虽只有短短的三个多月，事实已证明：毛主席指示的调整工商业政策实施的结果，在北京也和全国其他许多地方一样，已收到了很大的成效。
    今年三、四月，是京市工商业界最困难的时期。商业申请开业与歇业的，三月份是二六二户对三七二户；四月份一变而为二三六户对七三八户，歇业户比开业户增加了两倍多。从工业局开歇业统计表上来看，工业在这两个月内是开业多于歇业，但实际上新开的多是小户，而许多大的工厂不是陷于停顿，就是严重的产品滞销。此时，有些工商业家失去信心，认为如此巨大的困难是难于克服的。但，时间没有多久，困难的局面就被扭转过来了：市场成交量增多，停工的有些已恢复生产，商业开业的多于歇业，甚至有四十多户申请歇业的商店又恢复营业。若以五月份市场主要商品的成交量与三月份比较，面粉增加了百分之二十二点五，粗细粮增加了百分之十五点六，布匹增加了百分之一百六十。再以商业的开歇业而论，从六月上旬开始；歇业的减少到八十八户，开业的有九十九户；中旬以后，开业的增到一百二十三户，歇业的减少到五十二户，开业比歇业的已增加百分之七十。
    二、工作组的推进作用
    京市工商业在五月份能够逐步好转，主要得力于市场真实购买力的逐渐恢复，劳资双方的共同努力和人民政府调整工商业政策的正确贯彻。和全国许多地方一样，京市人民政府曾先后采取了一系列的措施，其中尤以市财经委员会领导组成的调整工商业工作小组，在调整工商业中起了推进的作用。大致说来，工作组在两个多月的期间，曾在三方面进行了工作。第一、有重点的选择一些典型工厂商店，帮助解决劳资纠纷，并进而建立劳资协商会议。工作组所挑选的工厂商店，一般是问题较多而又带有普遍性的。如针织业中最大的裕华棉织厂，劳资间非常不团结，使生产遭受损失。经工作组深入了解情况，多方调解帮助后，劳资关系已趋正常。资方经营情绪增高，劳方积极生产，使产量较前提高了百分之十五，废品率大大减低。鸿兴德粮店资方思想有顾虑，劳方要求过高，使本来赚钱的买卖陷于停顿，经工作组妥善解决了劳资纠纷后，资方愿意重新投资继续经营。解决了几个类似这样的问题以后，对一般的劳资关系问题起了良好的示范作用。织染、针织等行业的公会负责人，在谈到各该业的劳资关系时，都认为比从前好多了。第二、工作组帮助各工厂承揽加工、订货及原料交换成品等，使专靠加工、订货或产品滞销的行业。能够继续生产。如铁工、织染、针织、卷烟、火柴等行业，都或多或少地经工作组介绍，得到一批加工、订货，或卖出部分成品。第三、工作组协助各厂改进生产技术，以求提高产品质量，减低成本；有重点的解决原料的供给和统一成品的推销，使某些行业逐步作到有计划的产销。在工作组的协助下，现已成立了铁工业加工订货管理委员会，今后将由该会统一吸收和分配加工、订货任务，并帮助各厂克服因技术不良设备不全而造成的产品不合规格的现象。机制卷烟业成立了技术改进委员会，主要有三个工作：（一）将成品划分为几个等级，在生产技术上加以指导，以克服过去因成品时好时坏影响销路的现象；（二）有重点地统一供给原料，这样就可以逐渐克服因原料供给不上影响生产、或原料突然上涨影响成本的现象，现北京酒业专卖分公司已答应成立一个机构，专管原料的供给；（三）根据北京机制卷烟现时可能有的销售市场，统一分配各厂的成品生产数量，并由该会所属推销组负责推销。至于各厂在分配的数量外另外制造的成品，则由各厂自己负责推销。
    三、国家财经机关的大力扶助
    在调整工商业工作组进行工作的期间，各国营贸易机关、税务局和人民银行北京分行等部门，在调整公私关系上也作出了许多成绩。四至六月，花纱布分公司以纱换布的数量，占织染业全部产品的百分之五十三左右；百货分公司收购和交换各业产品如毛巾、线袜、纸烟、胶底等，约值一百零五亿余元。国营贸易机关调整价格，撤消部分零售公司、限制零售商品种类并拉住牌价的结果，使私营商业扩大了销售范围，增大了销货额，而且一般行业已有利可图。以五月份而论，市场粮食成交总额中有百分之八一点九六，面粉有百分之五五点二六，布匹有百分之九四点四，都是私商出售的。税务局对于去年下半年工商业税的滞纳户，凡确有困难者，均分别照顾。截至五月底，决定予以减、免和缓缴者共有两千五百多户，合税款二十八亿五千余万元。同时税局并在可能范围内，改变了征税的方法。如机制卷烟业的货物税，原来是成品当日出厂，当日完税；现已改为每旬完税一次。这对于各厂的帮助很大。人民银行北京分行，四、五两月共贷给私营工商业户八十二亿余元，六月份更扩大贷款范围，共贷出九十六亿余元，较前两个月的贷款总数超过了百分之十七。
    四、工商业家还要继续努力
    京市私营工商业，今天虽已开始好转，人民政府并将继续贯彻调整工商业的政策以争取根本的好转，但是要做到根本好转，私营工商业本身需要改进的地方还是很多的，特别是要改进经营方针与方法，克服保守与落后的观点。过去这一段时期，有许多工厂商店，由于劳资双方的共同努力，在改变经营方针、精简机构，减裁冗员方面，特别是工业在提高产品的数量与质量方面，均获得相当成绩。但总的说来，成本高、质量次，则仍是私营工业普遍存在着的一个问题。今后如何将经营方针改变得更适合于广大人民，特别是广大农民的需要，以及如何改进技术，提高质量，减低成本，实是私营企业必须努力的方向。铁工业中的义昌工厂，在六月份为华北农业机械总厂加工一批喷雾器零件，因该厂对本身技术未加改进，以致作出来的成品不合规格。恒德成织布厂在今年三月间，全厂只有三十多个工人，但职员却有十七、八人，每月职员的薪金，比工人工资多出二分之一。因而只有改变了经营方针和旧的经营方法，前途才会是光明的！
