To the Editors of People's Daily:

　　I am a student at the Hebei Provincial Tongxian Women's Normal School. I am now writing to tell you about our long-term production and savings campaign, hoping it can be published in the People's Garden for other schools to refer to.

　　In terms of saving electricity, the whole school has made great achievements. In the past, we used a total of 7,030 candlepower of lights, consuming 427 units of electricity per month. After implementing savings measures, we reduced consumption by 125 units per month. Each unit costs 1,800 yuan, saving a total of 225,000 yuan.

　　In terms of production: the main activities are raising livestock and reclaiming wasteland. The wasteland at the foot of the east city wall of Tongxian has been completely turned into a vegetable garden, and we have harvested 2,800 jin of vegetables, which has improved the students' meals. We raised twelve pigs, which yielded the equivalent of more than ten dan of corn, solving the difficulties of some faculty and staff. We raised thirty-three chickens, and the egg production is enough to cover the salary of a worker. Last year, the workers also started sideline production – opening a tofu workshop to supply students with vegetables, eliminating exploitation by merchants, until it temporarily closed in the hot weather. The school repairs houses and expands the playground, which requires a large amount of yellow soil. Buying a cartload at the door costs seven sheng of corn, which adds up to a large expense. We harnessed the mules that grind flour to carts and went out of the city to pull yellow soil ourselves. We pulled 140 cartloads, saving another fourteen dan of corn after deducting the mules' feed.

　　One day, when the workers were holding a group meeting, they proposed making their own coal briquettes for burning, which was approved by all the students and staff. On the first day, they made 1,500 jin. Three days later, the east playground was covered with a black expanse, all self-made coal briquettes. Hiring someone to make one ton costs one dou of corn. If we continue to make our own in the winter, we can save dozens of dan of corn.

　　Teachers and students try their best to make their own instrument substitutes. The physics teacher said, "Teaching you to make your own instruments will help you overcome the difficulties of temporarily inadequate equipment in rural primary schools when you go to teach in the countryside in the future." For example: the steam engine model we use is very expensive if it's made by the Shanghai Instrument Factory, but we made it ourselves with wooden boards, wooden strips, and a few small nails. The gold leaf electroscope is made of tin foil from cigarette packs. The self-made crystal radio can be used to listen to radio programs without any consumption. We can also make simple compass needles ourselves. We find our own biological experimental materials. The fishing nets and insect nets used for collecting specimens are all made by ourselves, saving a lot of money.

　　Of course, we cannot be satisfied with such simple equipment. When the country's economic conditions allow, we will improve the school's equipment properly.

### 河北省立通县女师生产节约自制仪器

　　河北省立通县女师生产节约自制仪器编辑同志：
    我是河北省立通县女师的学生。现在把我们的长期生产节约运动的情况告诉你们，希望在人民园地上发表出来，供其他学校参考。
    在节电方面，全校有了很大的成绩。过去我们用灯共七千零三十支光，每月耗电四百二十七个字。实行节约后，每月减少了一百二十五个字，每个字一千八百元，共省了二十二万五千元。
    在生产方面：主要是养家畜、开荒。通县东城墙根的荒地，完全开成了一片菜园，现已收得蔬菜二千八百斤，改善了学生的伙食。养了十二只猪，共获利合玉米十石以上，解决了若干教职员的困难。养鸡三十三只，鸡蛋的生产完全够一个工友的薪金。工人同志去年就搞起了副业生产——开豆腐房，供给同学吃菜，免去商人从中剥削，直到热天才暂时歇业。学校修理房子，扩大操场，需要大量的黄土，在门口买一车要七升玉米，合计起来又是一笔大开销。我们把拉磨的骡套上了大车，自己出城去拉黄土，拉了一百四十车，除去骡子的草料，又省下了十四担玉米。
    有一天工人开小组会时，又提议自己摇煤球烧，受到全体学生员工的赞成。第一天就摇了一千五百斤。三天以后东操场上摆满了黑黑的一片，都是自己摇出的煤球。找人摇一吨工钱是一斗玉米。到了冬天还是自己摇的话，可节省几十担玉米。
    师生们尽可能的自己制造仪器代用品。物理先生说：“教你们自己制造仪器，将来你们到农村教学去，可以克服农村小学暂时设备不周的困难。”例如：我们使用的蒸气机模型，上海仪器厂的出品很贵，自己用木板、木条、几个小钉，就制成了。金箔验电器是用烟卷里的锡纸代替了。自作的矿石收音机，不用任何消耗即可听到广播电台的节目。自己也能制简单的磁针。生物的实验材料，自己去找。采集标本用的鱼网和昆虫网，都是自己做的，省了很多钱。
    自然，我们不能自满于这样简陋的设备。在国家经济条件允许的时候，我们要好好改进学校的设备的。
