The members shall elect a chairman and one or more vice-chairmen to preside over the association's affairs. Several departments may be established under the committee to handle specific tasks.
    Article 13: The term of office of members of the Farmers' Association Committee at all levels shall be stipulated in the Articles of Association of the Provincial Farmers' Association.
    Article 14: In areas where the Farmers' Association has not yet been established, the local People's Government may convene a temporary Farmers' Representative Conference to elect a number of members to form a Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee, which shall perform the tasks of the Farmers' Association Committee and have the same powers as the Farmers' Association Committee. The task of the Preparatory Committee shall end after the official convening of the Farmers' Representative Congress and the election of the Farmers' Association Committee.
    Article 15: The Farmers' Representative Congress and the Farmers' Association Committee at all levels may impose sanctions on those who violate the Articles of Association and discipline of the Farmers' Association, depending on the specific circumstances. Sanctions against individual members include admonishment, warning, removal from work, and even expulsion from membership.

If the Articles of Association of the Farmers' Association have been formulated before the promulgation of these Regulations, any conflicts with these Regulations shall be amended in accordance with these Regulations.
