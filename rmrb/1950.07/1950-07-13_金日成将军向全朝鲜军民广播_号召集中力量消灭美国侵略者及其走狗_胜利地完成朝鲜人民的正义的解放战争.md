Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, delivered a radio address to the entire nation at 9:00 PM on the 8th, denouncing the US imperialists' aggressive act of armed interference in Korea's internal affairs, and reported the brilliant results of the Korean People's Army's victorious advance, calling on the entire nation to concentrate all its strength to thoroughly eliminate the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang, and to victoriously complete the Korean people's just war of liberation. The full text of the speech is as follows:

    The Shameless Armed Aggression by US Imperialism Aims to Turn Korea into a Permanent Colony
    Dear Compatriots! Dear Brothers and Sisters! Valiant Officers and Soldiers of the People's Army! Guerrilla Fighters in the Southern Half!

    The US imperialists have begun their armed attack on our fatherland and people. Their air force squadrons are barbarously bombing our cities and villages, massacring peaceful people. The US imperialist naval fleet has illegally intruded into our territorial waters, conducting bestial shelling of coastal cities and villages. The bloody hooves of the US Army have trampled on the territory of our fatherland, landing in the yet-to-be-liberated southern half of our fatherland, and viciously deploying lines of battle, attempting to stop our army's southward advance.

    Why have the US imperialists dispatched their troops to the territory of our fatherland? Why are these plundering bloodsuckers invading the territory of our newborn fatherland? We Korean people have never invaded an inch of American soil at any time, nor have we infringed upon their sovereignty in the slightest. We Korean people have never had any hostile relations with the American people, nor have we harmed the lives and property of peaceful American residents. So why are the US imperialists dispatching their troops to our territory to militarily interfere in our internal affairs, and massacre our people, turning our beautiful country into a place of bloodshed? This is because the US imperialists, who are妄想制霸 (plotting to dominate) the world, are attempting to turn our fatherland into a colony under their long-term rule. To achieve this goal, the US imperialists have fostered Syngman Rhee, the Korean people's irreconcilable enemy, in the southern half of our fatherland, and fabricated the South Korean puppet government. At the same time, the US imperialists, using methods such as terror, murder, threats, and deception, have obstructed and sabotaged the peaceful reunification of the fatherland desired by the Korean people, manipulated their running dog Syngman Rhee's gang to provoke a fratricidal civil war in our country, and further implemented a bestial armed intervention. The US imperialists do not recognize the sacred right of the Korean people to freedom and independence, and do not treat us Korean people as human beings. The American bandits believe that the Korean people have no other fate than to permanently become colonial slaves to further fill the bloody moneybags of Wall Street merchants.

    The US imperialist plunderers treat our peaceful cities and villages as places for their military exercises, and treat our young men and women, old people and children as targets for their aircraft strafing and bombing. Cities such as Pyongyang, Nampo, Haeju, Wonsan, and Hamhung north of the 38th parallel, and the surrounding rural areas, have been subjected to several bestial bombings. Cities such as Seoul, Chuncheon, Kaesong, Uijeongbu, Jumunjin, and Gangneung south of the 38th parallel, and the vast rural areas, are constantly suffering from the brutal bombing of US air force squadrons. The hired executioners are blindly bombing and strafing rural women transplanting rice seedlings in the paddy fields and innocent children. In this way, US imperialism has adopted the extremely brutal methods of massacring people that were once used by the fascists Hitler and the Japanese bandits.

    The US Attempts to Use the UN Security Council's Illegal Resolution to Conceal Its Armed Invasion of Korea
    The US imperialists are attempting to cover up their armed invasion of our fatherland with the illegal decision of the United Nations Security Council on the Korean issue. However, this decision of the Security Council was passed without the participation of representatives of the Republic of Korea government, nor the participation of Soviet and Chinese representatives. Therefore, this decision violates the United Nations Charter and is illegal. The purpose of the US imperialism's attack on Korea is very clear to the people of the world. The US imperialists' delusional statement that the American troops are only performing the United Nations' police duties in Korea cannot deceive anyone. The United Nations organization was not established for the US imperialist plunderers to abuse the United Nations' signboard to bomb our Korean cities and rural areas, and massacre our people who are fighting for freedom, unification, and independence. The US imperialists are throwing bombs on the heads of the Korean people while barking that they are doing this for peace, but such lies cannot deceive anyone. The fascist Hitler and the Japanese imperialists, the precursors of this method of aggression, have already used this method extensively.

    As the world knows, Hitler once said, "Every time I talk about peace, I think of war." The Japanese imperialists also disguised their aggression in the Far East with false declarations for the sake of Asian peace. On August 29, 1910, the Japanese Emperor's edict stated: In order to "maintain lasting peace in the East," Japan annexed Korea, describing Korea as a threat to Eastern peace. Today, the US imperialists, who are depriving our fatherland of its independence and want to turn our fatherland into its colony, are doing exactly the same as the fascist Hitler and the Japanese imperialists. The US imperialists are attempting to conceal their armed intervention in our country's internal affairs and the barbaric bombing of peaceful people with shameless statements. The US imperialists' armed invasion of Korea blatantly violates international law and the United Nations Charter. No matter how the US imperialists use force to invade our country, it can never weaken the Korean people's will to fight for the freedom and independence of their fatherland, and their heroic spirit.

    The People's Army Fights Heroically and Achieves Remarkable Results, and Will Surely Drive the US Imperialist Plunderers Out of Our Territory
    The Korean people, who have risen up for the sacred cause of defending the honor, freedom and independence of their fatherland, are fighting to the death against the aggression of US imperialism, and must achieve final victory. In the struggle to liberate the fatherland, our People's Army, although young and lacking combat experience, has displayed a heroic spirit of dedication and has already achieved remarkable results. Our People's Army units, after liberating the capital Seoul, pursuing the remaining enemy, breaking through the barbaric bombing of the US air force units, crossing the Han River and breaking through the enemy's positions on the south bank, completely liberated our country's industrial areas, including the cities of Yeongdeungpo, Bupyeong, and Incheon, and the surrounding areas, liberated Suwon, which the enemy called their second base, and continued to advance south. Another unit of the People's Army in the Chuncheon and Hongcheon area, after liberating cities and nearby rural areas such as Wonju, Hoengseong, Yeoju, and Jecheon, continued to advance south and has liberated Chungju.

    Our young air force units defeated the enemy's combat system and bravely attacked the air force squadrons of the US armed aggressors. The brave eagles of the Korean people shot down dozens of enemy bombers and fighters, led by the B-29, which they boasted was a fortress in the air, in fierce air battles, effectively guaranteeing the advance of ground forces.

    Our tank soldiers, of whom our army is proud, bravely and decisively attacked, broke through the enemy's defensive positions, gave the enemy no chance to breathe, threw the enemy into chaos, and scattered in all directions. Our tank units, pursuing and annihilating the enemy, were the first to attack our capital Seoul, and have now won the glorious title of "Seoul Tank Division."

    Our infantry and artillery showed tenacity, decisiveness and heroism in their advance.

    The young navy of the Republic also demonstrated heroism in carrying out its combat missions. The great feat of our torpedo boat units bravely attacking the powerful enemy and sinking the cruiser of the US armed aggressors will forever be written in our naval history. The People's Army units inflicted the first disastrous defeat on the US military in combat against the US armed aggressors' army.

    The achievements we have made on the front lines show that the strength of our people who have risen up to fight for the independence and freedom of their fatherland is great and infinite. The brave People's Army will certainly be able to, and must, drive the US imperialist plunderers out of our territory. Our People's Army has all the necessary conditions to completely annihilate the enemy because it is armed with modern combat technology. Our People's Army is not fighting for dollars or to enslave other nations like the American mercenary executioners. We are fighting for the freedom and independence of our own fatherland and people. Our soldiers' patriotism is the source of their heroism. The army of the American plunderers is fighting on the territory of other countries. Our People's Army is fighting on the territory of its own fatherland, under the care and concern of the entire people.

    The Entire Nation Actively Supports the People's Army and the Guerrilla Fighters in the South Respond to the Advance
    The army of the American plunderers is hated by all our people, and every time they commit a crime, the flames of revenge are ignited. The US armed intervention in our country has brought the Korean people's anger and hatred towards the American colonial plunderers and their running dogs in South Korea to the extreme.

    Our brave young men are rising up like a tide to join the People's Army. The number of volunteers has now exceeded 500,000.

    In every corner of the country, volunteer units and joint units have been organized, and they will resist enemy incursions in any area where the invaders appear, and defend the territory of our fatherland.

    Responding to the heroic advance of the People's Army, the guerrillas, who have boldly risen up in North Gyeongsang Province, South Gyeongsang Province, South Jeolla Province and other places, are expanding their area of operations and, with the support of the entire people, are strengthening their struggle against the American armed invaders and the Syngman Rhee gang.

    The entire people in the newly liberated areas warmly welcome the heroic People's Army, who liberated them from the police violence system of the Syngman Rhee gang.

    The liberated people are restoring the people's committees that had been disbanded by the reactionaries, and implementing the constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which guarantees the people's rights and freedoms.

    According to the order of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the peasants in the liberated areas are beginning to implement the land reform that Korean peasants have always longed for. According to this order, all the land owned by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet government, Korean landlords, and national traitors is completely confiscated, distributed to the peasants free of charge, and owned by them forever.

    The collapse of the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang's army and state institutions exposed the internal corruption of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, which oppresses the South Korean people under the armed support of the US imperialists, and proved that this regime has no support from the Korean people.

    The victory of the People's Army and the extreme support and solidarity of the entire Korean people for the People's Army proved the strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and proved that the entire people actively support the policies of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because it opposes the US imperialists' vicious plan to colonize our country, opposes their deprivation of the Korean people's sovereignty, and defends the independence and freedom of our country against their armed invasion.

    This victory is due to the unified uprising of the people in the northern half of our Republic to defend the democratic system established in the northern half, and is due to the support of the people in the southern half of the Republic for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, demanding that the democratic reforms that have been implemented in North Korea, which guarantee the political and economic democratic development of the country and improve the material well-being of the people, be implemented in the southern half of our country as well.

    The US Imperialists' Shameless Invasion of the Korean People Has Aroused the Anger of the World's Democratic Camp
    In order to save the Syngman Rhee gang, which failed in its implementation of US policy in Korea, the US imperialists are further intensifying their armed invasion against the Korean people.

    If there had been no direct armed intervention by the US imperialists, then the civil war launched by the US imperialists' running dogs in our country would have ended long ago, the unification of our country would have been completed long ago, and the people in the southern half would have been completely liberated from the reactionary police rule of the Syngman Rhee gang.

    The US imperialists' armed invasion of Korea has aroused the anger of the world's democratic camp.

    The Soviet Union, China, France, Britain, Germany, Australia, Italy, Pakistan, Japan and other countries around the world, as well as within the United States, have launched mass movements with the slogan "Get out of Korea" to oppose the US imperialists' policy of aggression against our country. We have received enthusiastic response and sympathy from the freedom-loving people of the world.

    Dear Compatriots, Brothers and Sisters!

    The enemy of the Korean people's freedom and independence, the US imperialists, have extended their thieving claws into our territory in order to enslave our country. The Korean people must unite as one and respond to the US imperialists' attack with a decisive blow. The US imperialists will certainly know how great and infinite the strength of our Korean people is, and how firm our will to fight for the freedom and independence of our fatherland is. Our people can no longer be colonial slaves. All those who value the honor, freedom and independence of their fatherland should unite and participate in the sacred war to liberate the fatherland against the armed aggression of the US imperialists.

    The Korean People Must Unite as One and Respond to the US Imperialists' Attack with a Decisive Blow
    We must never allow the US imperialists to commit crimes on the territory of our fatherland, and we must never allow their crimes of bombing our peaceful cities and villages and bombing to death our parents, brothers, sisters and innocent children. Not only we, but our descendants, will forever curse the US imperialist plunderers who massacred our people. The names of those who fight against foreign armed aggression for the freedom and independence of our fatherland will be written in a glorious page in Korean history.

    All patriots of our fatherland! Dear brothers and sisters!

    The cause of fighting for the freedom and independence of our fatherland is the Korean people's own cause. In the cruel battle with the enemy, we must bravely destroy the enemy and do our best to assist the People's Army advancing south to respond to the armed invasion of the US imperialists. We must mobilize all resources and materials to assist the People's Army. In order to eliminate the US imperialist plunderers and the Syngman Rhee gang as soon as possible, we must produce more food, steel, etc., and we must strive to save more. We must establish new labor achievements, strengthen labor discipline, and quickly restore the bombed industrial enterprises, so as to further consolidate our rear.

    Brave male and female guerrilla fighters! People in the yet-to-be-liberated areas!

    We must launch guerrilla activities with the struggle of the entire people to oppose the Korean people's enemy - the US imperialist plunderers and their running dogs. The guerrillas must attack the enemy more bravely, boldly, and ruthlessly, destroy transportation, bridges, and communication links, and disrupt the troop movements and the transportation of weapons and military supplies of the US imperialist plunderers. They must attack and destroy the enemy's armories and military supply warehouses. As long as we see the enemy's strength, we must destroy it. We must set fire under the feet of the enemies who have invaded our sacred territory. Your heroic activities behind enemy lines will accelerate the advance of the People's Army and will accelerate the great victory.

    Plant the National Flag on Mount Halla on Jeju Island to End the Just War of Liberation with Victory
    Brave soldiers of the People's Army, officers!

    All the people of Korea are watching your great achievements in the struggle for the fatherland and the people with unparalleled enthusiasm. Annihilate the vicious aggressors more ruthlessly. Give the enemy no time to breathe, bravely pursue them, and wipe out the US imperialist plunderers and their running dogs in order to completely liberate our territory. The People's Army officers must learn the art of commanding modern combat and bravely guarantee the mobile operations between troops in order to encircle and annihilate the enemy.

    We must make full use of the excellent technology of our army.

    People's Army infantry, tank soldiers, motorcycle soldiers, machine gun shooters, artillery, drivers, navymen! You have demonstrated heroism and dedication in defeating the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Bravely annihilate the troops of the US imperialist plunderers who have invaded our territory. Use your weapons to aim at the enemy, and remember that you are performing a sacred mission in front of your fatherland and people.

    The glorious achievements and brave spirit left by our ancestors, such as Generals Eulji Mundeok, Gang Gam-chan, and Yi Sun-sin, who repelled foreign invaders and defended our country, will inspire our People's Army officers and soldiers and all the people to make great contributions in the sacred struggle for the freedom and independence of our country.

    Forward to drive the US imperialists from the territory of our country, where our ancestors' remains are buried and where our descendants are growing!

    Plant the glorious flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Busan, Mokpo, and Mount Halla on Jeju Island to end our just war of liberation with victory.

    March towards victory!

    Long live the free and independent Korea!

　　金日成将军向全朝鲜军民广播
    号召集中力量消灭美国侵略者及其走狗
    胜利地完成朝鲜人民的正义的解放战争
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军事委员会委员长兼朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军，于八日晚九时向全国军民发表广播演说，痛斥美帝国主义武装干涉朝鲜内政的侵略行为，并报告朝鲜人民军胜利进军的辉煌战果，号召全国军民集中一切力量，彻底消灭美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮，胜利地完成朝鲜人民的正义的解放战争。演说全文如下：
        美帝国主义无耻地武装侵略是企图变朝鲜为永久殖民地
    亲爱的同胞们！亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！英勇的人民军官们和战士们！南半部的游击队员们！
    美帝国主义者已开始了对我祖国和人民的武装进攻。它们的空军机群在野蛮地轰炸着我国的城市与乡村，屠杀着和平人民。美帝国主义的海军舰队非法地侵入我国领海，对沿岸的城市和乡村进行着野兽般的炮击。美陆军部队的血蹄踏进我祖国的疆土，在尚未解放的我们祖国南半部地区登陆，并凶恶地布置战线，企图阻止我们军队的南下。
    美帝国主义者为什么要派遣自己的军队到我们祖国的疆土来呢？这些掠夺的吸血鬼们为什么侵犯我新生祖国的领土呢？我们朝鲜人民任何时候也未曾侵犯过美国的寸土，亦丝毫未侵犯过它们的主权。我们朝鲜人民对美国人民未曾有过任何敌对关系，亦未侵害过美国和平居民的生命财产。那么美帝国主义者为什么要派遣自己的军队到我国领土来对我国内政进行军事干涉，并屠杀我们人民，使我们美丽的江山变成流血的场所呢？这是因为，妄想制霸世界的美帝国主义者企图将我祖国变为它长期统治的殖民地。为了达到这一目的，美帝国主义者在我祖国南半部扶植了朝鲜人民不共戴天的仇敌李承晚掌握政权，并捏造了南朝鲜傀儡政府。美帝国主义者同时又以恐怖、残杀、威胁和欺瞒等手段，妨害与破坏了朝鲜人民所渴望的祖国和平统一，操纵其走狗李承晚匪帮在我国挑起同族相争的内战，并进而实行野兽般的武装干涉。美帝国主义者不承认朝鲜人民自由和独立的神圣权利，不把我们朝鲜人民当人看待。美国强盗们以为朝鲜人民除永久成为更多地装满华尔街商人的血腥钱袋的殖民地奴隶外别无其他命运。
    美帝国主义掠夺者把我们和平城市与乡村当作它军事演习的场所，把我们青年男女和老幼当作它飞机扫射与轰炸的目标。在三八线以北平壤、南浦、海州、元山、咸兴等城市及其附近的农村，均遭到数次的野兽轰炸。在三八线以南解放了的汉城、春川、开城、议政府、注文津、江陵等城市与广大农村，不断遭受着美空军机群的残暴轰炸。雇佣的刽子手们，对在稻田里插秧的农村妇女与天真烂漫的儿童，亦进行盲目炸射。美帝国主义就这样袭用了法西斯希特勒与日寇曾经使用过的凶暴无比的屠杀人民的方法。
            美国图以安理会非法决议掩饰它对朝鲜的武装侵犯
    美帝国主义企图以联合国安全理事会对朝鲜问题的非法决定来掩盖它对我祖国的武装侵犯。但这个安全理事会的决定是在既没有朝鲜共和国政府的代表参加，也没有苏联和中国代表的参加下通过的。因而这个决定是违反联合国宪章的，是非法的。美帝国主义对朝鲜进攻的目的，全世界的人民都是非常清楚的。美帝国主义者叫嚣美国军队只在朝鲜执行联合国的警察职权的虚妄声明，是欺骗不了任何人的。联合国机构并不是为美帝国主义掠夺者滥用联合国的招牌来轰炸我们朝鲜城市和农村，屠杀我们争取自由统一与独立的人民而设的。美帝国主义者一面在朝鲜人民头上投掷炸弹，一面又狂吠说这样做是为了和平，然而这种谰言是欺骗不了任何人的。这种侵略方法美帝国主义的先师希特勒法西斯与日本帝国主义者们早已广泛地使用过了。
    举世皆知，希特勒曾说“我每当谈到和平时就联想到战争”。日本帝国主义者把自己在远东的侵略也是以为了亚洲和平的虚伪声明来掩饰的。一九一零年八月二十九日，日本天皇的敕令说：为了“维持东方的持久和平”，日本吞并朝鲜，而竟把朝鲜形容为东方和平的威胁。今天剥夺我们祖国的独立，欲变我们祖国为其殖民地的美帝国主义者，与希特勒法西斯和日本帝国主义者的所作所为毫无二致。美帝国主义者企图以无耻的声明来掩饰其对我们祖国内政的武装干涉，和对和平人民的野蛮轰炸。美帝国主义对朝鲜的武装侵犯，横暴地违反了国际法与联合国宪章。不管美帝国主义者怎样用武力来侵略我国，但它绝不能削弱朝鲜人民争取祖国自由独立的斗争意志与英雄气概。
            人民军英勇战斗获显著成果必将美帝掠夺者自国土逐出
    为保卫祖国的荣誉和自由独立的神圣事业而奋起的朝鲜人民，反对美帝国主义的侵略，誓死斗争，一定要取得最后胜利。在为解放祖国的斗争中，我们的人民军队虽然年青而且缺乏战斗经验，但已发挥了英勇的献身精神并已经取得了显著的成果。我们的人民军部队在解放了首都汉城、追击残敌、突破美空军部队的野蛮轰炸、渡过了汉江及突破了南岸的敌军阵地后，又完全解放了我国的工业地带永登浦、富平、仁川等城市及其附近地区，解放了敌人自称为第二根据地的水原，继续南进。春川、洪川方面的人民军另部在解放了原州、横城、骊州、堤川等城市及附近的农村之后，继续南进，已将忠州解放。
    我们年青的空军部队击溃了敌军的战斗体系，勇敢地攻击了美国武装侵犯者的空军机群。朝鲜人民的勇敢之鹰在激烈的空战中击落了敌人自夸为空中堡垒的Ｂ——二九式为首的轰炸机与战斗机数十架，有效地保障了地面部队的前进。
    我们军队以之自豪的坦克手们，勇敢的决定的攻击，突破了敌人的防御阵地，不给敌人以喘息的机会，使敌人陷入混乱，四散逃窜。我们的坦克部队，追歼敌人，首先攻入我国首都汉城，现已获得“汉城坦克师团”的光荣称号。
    我们的步兵和炮兵在进军中表现了强韧果断与英勇。
    共和国的年青海军也在执行自己的战斗任务中发挥了英勇精神。我们的水雷艇部队勇敢地打击强敌，击沉美国武装侵略者巡洋舰的伟大功勋，将永远写在我们的海军史上。人民军部队在和美国武装侵犯者的陆军作战中使美军遭到头一次的惨败。
    我们在前线取得的战果说明：我们人民奋起为祖国独立自由而进行的斗争，其力量是巨大的，无穷的。勇敢的人民军队一定能够，而且必须把美帝国主义掠夺者从我国疆土上驱逐出去。我们人民军队具有能以完全歼灭敌人的一切必要条件，因为它是以现代的战斗技术武装起来的。我们的人民军队绝不象美军雇佣兵刽子手们那样为美元或为奴役其他民族而战，我们是为自己祖国与人民的自由独立而斗争。我们战士的爱国主义是英勇精神的泉源。美国掠夺者的军队在他国的领土上作战。而我们的人民军，是在全体人民的爱护关怀下，在自己祖国的领土上作战。
            全国人民积极支援人民军队南部游击战士奋起响应进军
    美国掠夺者的军队，受到我们全体人民的憎恨，每当他们进行罪恶行动时，就燃起了复仇的火焰。美国对我国的武装干涉，使得朝鲜人民对美国殖民地掠夺者及其在南朝鲜的走狗的愤怒与憎恨，达到极点。
    我们勇敢的青年们，象潮水似的起来参加人民军志愿兵现已超过五十万。
    在全国的每一个角落里，都编制了志愿兵部队和联合部队，他们将在侵犯者出现的任何地区抵抗敌人的侵犯，保卫我祖国的领土。
    响应人民军的英勇进军而大胆奋起的游击队，在庆尚北道、庆尚南道、全罗南道等地，正在扩大着自己的活动地区，并在全体人民的支持下，加强着反对美国武力侵犯者与李承晚匪帮的斗争。
    新解放地区的全体人民都热烈地欢迎着从李承晚匪帮的警察暴力制度中，把他们解放出来的英勇的人民军。
    获得解放的人民，正在恢复着曾被反动派解散了的人民委员会，实施着保障人民权利与自由的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法。
    解放地区的农民，根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会的命令，正在着手实施朝鲜农民一向渴望着的土地改革。根据这一命令，美帝国主义者与李承晚傀儡政府、朝鲜地主以及民族叛徒所有的一切土地，完全予以没收，无偿地分给农民，并永远为其所有。
    李承晚卖国匪帮的军队与国家机构的崩溃，暴露了在美帝国主义者的武装支持下，压迫南朝鲜人民的李承晚傀儡统治制度的内部腐败，证明了这一制度毫不受朝鲜人民的任何支持。
    人民军队的胜利和全体朝鲜人民对人民军队的极力支持与声援，证明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的坚强，证明了全体人民积极拥护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的政策。因为它反对美帝国主义者使我祖国殖民地化的凶恶计划，反对他们剥夺朝鲜人民的主权，反对对我祖国所实行的武装侵犯而保卫我祖国的独立自由。
    这一胜利是由于我共和国北半部的人民一致奋起保卫了树立在北半部的民主制度，是由于共和国南半部人民支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，要求在我祖国的南半部也实施已在北朝鲜实施了的保障祖国的政治经济民主发展与提高人民物质福利的民主改革。
            美帝对朝鲜人民的无耻侵犯引起全世界民主阵营的愤怒
    美帝国主义者为了挽救在朝鲜实施美国政策而遭到失败的李承晚匪帮，正进一步加强着反对朝鲜人民的武装侵犯。
    假若没有美帝国主义者直接的武装干涉，那么美帝国主义走狗在我祖国发动的内战，便早已会结束，我祖国的统一，便会早已完成，南半部人民会早已从李承晚匪帮的反动的警察统治下完全获得解放。
    美帝国主义者对朝鲜的武装侵犯，引起了全世界民主阵营的愤怒。
    苏联、中国、法国、英国、德国、澳大利亚、意大利、巴基斯坦、日本等世界各国和美国国内，也都提出“滚出朝鲜”的口号，展开群众性的运动，反对美帝国主义者对我祖国的侵略政策。我们已获得了世界爱好自由人民的热烈响应与同情。
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    朝鲜人民的自由与独立的仇敌——美帝国主义者，为了奴役我祖国而将强盗的魔手，伸到我们的领土来了。朝鲜人民一致团结起来，必须以决定性的打击来回答美帝国主义者的进攻。美帝国主义者一定会知道我们朝鲜人民的力量是何等的伟大、何等的无穷，为祖国自由独立的不屈不挠的斗争意志是何等的坚强。我们人民再也不能作殖民地奴隶，凡是重视祖国的荣誉和自由独立的人们，都应该一致参加解放祖国的神圣战争，以反对美帝国主义者的武装侵略。
            朝鲜人民必须一致团结起来以决定性打击回答美帝进攻
    我们绝不能容许美帝国主义者在我祖国的领土上进行罪恶行为，绝不容许它轰炸我们的和平城市与农村，炸死我们的父母兄弟姊妹和天真的儿童的罪恶行为。不仅我们，就是我们的后代，也将永远咀咒残杀我们人民的美帝国主义掠夺者。为了我祖国的自由独立而反对外国武装侵犯的斗士们的名字，在朝鲜的历史上将写下光荣的一页。
    我祖国的全体爱国者！亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！
    争取我祖国自由与独立的事业，是朝鲜人民自己的事业。在与敌人的残酷战斗中，要奋不顾身地消灭敌人，竭力援助向南进军的人民军队，以回答美帝国主义者的武装侵犯。要动员一切资源和物资援助人民军队。为了早日消灭美帝国主义掠夺者和李承晚匪帮，要多多生产食粮、钢铁等，更要极力节约。要建立新的劳动伟绩，加强劳动纪律，迅速恢复被轰炸的产业企业所，以便更加巩固我们的后方。
    英勇的男女游击队员们！尚未解放地区的人民！
    要以全体人民的斗争，来展开游击活动，以反对朝鲜人民的仇敌——美帝国主义掠夺者及其走狗。游击队要更勇敢地、大胆地、无情地攻击敌人，要破坏交通、运输、桥梁、通讯连络，要破坏美帝国主义掠夺者的军队调动和武器、军需物资的输送，要袭击捣毁敌人的军火库和军需仓库。只要看到敌人的有生力量，就要予以消灭。要叫侵入我们神圣疆土的仇敌的脚底下燃起火焰。你们在敌后的英勇活动，将加速人民军的前进，将加速伟大的胜利。
            把国旗插到济州岛汉拿山上以胜利结束正义的解放战争
    英勇的人民军战士们，军官们！
    全朝鲜的人民正以无比的热情在注视着你们在为祖国与人民的斗争中的丰功伟绩。要更无情的歼灭凶恶的侵略者。不要给敌人以喘息的时间，勇敢地予以追击，要扫除美帝国主义掠夺者及其走狗，以便完全解放我们的国土。人民军军官们要学会现代战斗的指挥艺术，要勇敢地保障部队之间的机动作战，以便围歼敌军。
    要充分利用我们军队的优秀的技术。
    人民军步兵、坦克兵、摩托车兵、机枪射手、炮兵、驾驶员、海军们！你们在击溃李承晚傀儡军队中，业已发挥了英勇性与献身性，要勇敢地消灭侵入我们疆土的美帝国主义掠夺者的军队。要利用自己的武器瞄准敌人，要牢记你们是在自己祖国与人民的面前执行神圣的任务。
    曾经击退外国侵略者保卫了我祖国的乙支文德、姜感赞、李舜臣将军等祖先们留下的光荣业迹与勇敢精神，将鼓舞我们人民军官兵和全体人民，在为祖国自由独立的神圣的斗争中建立伟大的功劳。
    为了从埋葬祖先遗骸并生长着我们后代的祖国疆土上驱逐美帝国主义者而前进！
    要把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国荣誉的旗帜插到釜山、木浦、济州岛上的汉拿山，要以胜利来结束我们正义的解放战争。
    向胜利迈进！
    自由独立的朝鲜万岁！
