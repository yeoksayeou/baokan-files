　　Problems to be Noted in This Year's Yellow River Flood Control
    Lǐ Pǔ
    Yellow River flood control is one of the key points of national flood control. The reason why Yellow River flood control work has always received the greatest attention is not only because the Yellow River's flow changes greatly, frequently, and rapidly, but also because its downstream riverbed is higher than the land on both sides. In the event of a breach, there is a risk of causing a change of course. If the south bank is breached, it will flow towards Anhui and Jiangsu; if the north bank is breached, it will enter the sea from Tianjin and Tanggu, flooding everywhere over a wide area, causing incalculable losses to people's lives and property. Therefore, conquering the Yellow River and ensuring that the Yellow River does not breach is a complex and arduous task that must be completed.

    This year's Yellow River flood control has more favorable conditions than in previous years. For example, the whole country has been liberated, and the river management agencies have a unified organization; the people have been managing the river for four years, investing huge manpower and material resources in embankment projects, and the projects have a considerable foundation; after years of flood control battles, the masses have established strict flood control organizations; social order is stable, and the mobilization of manpower and material resources and communication equipment are in better condition. However, precisely because of this, the task of this year's flood control must also be raised a step further, aiming to defend against floods even greater than those of 1949, and under normal circumstances, to ensure that the flow of 17,000 cubic meters per second at Shanzhou does not cause a breach. To complete this task, whether it is the river defense agency or the administrative leading organs, cadres, and masses of the provinces along the river, there must be no slackness, and the work must be carried out with the highest vigilance. The following issues must be paid attention to:

    1. The Yellow River is a famous river with a lot of sediment. Because of the sediment, it is prone to siltation and erosion, and the riverbed changes constantly. This not only causes the riverbed to silt up, reducing the river's capacity, but also easily leads to bank erosion and new dangers. Therefore, Yellow River flood control cannot only guard the existing dangerous works, but must also conduct frequent and close patrols to foresee the occurrence of new dangers.

    2. The dikes in Henan Province and the upper reaches of Pingyuan Province have not been tested much, and the great flood of 1949 did not pose a great threat to this area, which can easily lead people to mistakenly believe that the Henan dike is solid and secure. If the river rises sharply and forces against the dike body without prior warning, it will inevitably lead to panic.

    3. Since the breach at Huayuankou, the riverbed in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has changed. After the closure of the breach, the riverbed will inevitably undergo new changes. Therefore, although it has been four years since the breach was closed, the river course is still in a constant state of change. In 1949, the north-south movement of the main stream near Huayuankou reached four kilometers. The Yellow River is like a spring, one section moves, and all sections move, affecting the downstream far away.

    4. Although the embankments in Shandong and Pingyuan have been reinforced, and the dike works have also been strengthened, most of them are built with straw materials, and very few are built with stone materials, which means that the water resistance is insufficient. Although this cannot be replaced and repaired in the short term, it is still a cause for concern, and pre-emptive arrangements for rescue work must be made.

    5. The situation of the Yellow River is extremely unstable. In the existing records, the flow at Shanzhou has reached 23,000 cubic meters per second and 29,000 cubic meters per second, exceeding the flow of 17,000 cubic meters per second is very possible. How to remedy and strive for safety at this time must be planned in advance. It is reported that the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has made a plan to abandon the people's embankments and use the area south of Shou Zhang and north of Liangshan for flood storage, which is naturally very important. However, this only solves the problems of Shandong Province and a part of Pingyuan Province. If the water flow cannot be accommodated in Henan Province and the upper reaches of Pingyuan Province, how to deal with it must be designed in advance. These issues are related to the vital interests of the masses, and the specific difficulties in implementation must be estimated and resolved in advance.

    Raising vigilance and opposing complacency are important keys to overcoming floods. Some people believe that "floods have a periodicity, occurring every ten to fifteen years, and this year there will not be a flood as big as last year," and "this year's spring repair project is strong, ensuring that the river defense has no problems." These kinds of wishful thinking and complacency are extremely harmful. In fact, the problems of the Yellow River are still very complex, and our understanding of its changing laws is still very insufficient; although the dikes and dams have been universally strengthened this year, they are still far from the safety standards. Therefore, we must still use the highest vigilance, strengthen leadership, and conduct strict patrols to successfully complete this year's flood control task.

### 今年黄河防汛应注意的问题

　　今年黄河防汛应注意的问题
    李朴
    黄河防汛是全国防汛的重点之一。黄河防汛工作所以历来受到最大的重视，不只是因为黄河的流量变化较大较多较快，同时还因它下游的河槽，高于两岸的土地。万一发生溃决，就有造成改道的危险，冲决了南堤便向皖苏流去，冲决了北堤便自津沽入海，在广大的面积上到处横流，对于人民生命财产将是不可估算的损失。所以战胜黄河，保证黄河不发生溃决，是一件复杂艰巨而又必须完成的任务。
    今年黄河防汛，较之往年是有更为有利的条件了。比如全国解放，治河机构已经有了统一的组织；人民治河经过四年的岁月，在堤坝工程上投入巨大的人力物力，工程有了相当的基础；经过历年防汛的战斗，群众已经有了严密的防汛组织；社会秩序安定，人力物力的动员和交通电讯设备都有了较好的条件。可是正因如此，今年防汛的任务，也必须提高一步，要以防御比一九四九年更大的洪水为目标，在一般情况下，保证陕州流量一万七千秒公方不生溃决。要完成这一个任务，无论是河防机关和沿河各省的行政领导机关与干部、群众，不容有丝毫疏懈，必须用最高的警惕去进行工作。下面这些问题，均须加以注意：
    一、黄河是一个有名的多沙河道，因为多沙，便易于淤积和冲刷，河槽变化无常。这不只使河床淤高，减少河槽容量，且易致坐湾刷滩，发生新险。所以黄河的防汛不能只守住已有的险工，且须经常的严密巡守，能预见新险的发生。
    二、河南省和平原省上段大堤还少经考验，而且一九四九年大水在这一带的威胁不大，容易使人误认为河南大堤巩固无虞，设若河水猛涨，迫及堤身，而不预作警惕，必至仓惶失措。
    三、自花园口决口以后，黄河上游河槽已经起了变化，堵口后河槽必然又有新的变化，所以虽经堵口四年，而河道还在经常变迁不定的状态中。一九四九年在花园口附近正流南北的变动达四公里。黄河如弹簧，一节动，节节都动，影响下游很远。
    四、山东、平原的堤身虽然加培，坝工也已增强，但用秸料建造的多，石料建造的还很少，也就是防水的能力不足；这虽然不是短期内所可更换、增修的，但终究是可虑的一点，必须预作抢险的布置。
    五、黄河的情况是极不稳定的。在已有纪录中，陕州的流量曾经到达二万三千秒公方和二万九千秒公方，超出一万七千秒公方的流量是很可能的。在这种时候应该怎样补救和争取安全，必须预作筹划。据报黄河防汛总指挥部曾作出放弃民埝和利用寿张以南梁山以北地区蓄洪的计划，自然十分切要。但这只解决了山东省和平原省一部的问题，设若在河南省和平原省上段水流不能容纳时如何处理，还须预为设计。这些问题，关系群众的切身利益，执行上的具体困难都必须估计到，并预先加以解决。
    提高警惕，反对麻痹，是战胜洪水的重要关键。有些人认为“洪水有周期性，十年至十五年一至，今年不致再有去年的大水”，“今年春修工程强大，确保河防毫无问题”等。这一类的侥幸心理和自满情绪，都是极端有害的。实际上黄河的问题还很复杂，我们对于它变化的规律，认识还十分不够；堤防埽坝今年虽曾普遍加强，但是距离安全标准，相去尚远。因此我们还必须用最高的警惕，加强领导，严密巡守，以求胜利完成今年防汛的任务。
