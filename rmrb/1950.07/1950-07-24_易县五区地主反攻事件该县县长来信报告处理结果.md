    Report on the Handling Results of the Landlord Counter-Attack Incident in the Fifth District of Yi County from the County Magistrate
    Comrades Editors:
    After reading the article "Landlords Counter-Attack Emancipated Peasants, Zhang Zihou of the Fifth District of Yi County Appeals" published in your newspaper on July 3rd, this government immediately dispatched Zhao Hezhu, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section, to investigate in Liaoshui Village, along with village cadres. The truth of the matter basically matched the situation described in the newspaper, and it has been dealt with.
    Zhang Zihou is from Liaoshui. In 1937, his entire family (eight people) moved to Taipingyu Village in Xiling, this county, to settle down. They bought two rooms and about ten mu of land (they also had eight mu of land in Liaoshui Village, but no house). By the time of the land reform in 1946, Zhang Zihou's family of four had moved back to Liaoshui Village and were allocated five mu of land (bringing their total land to thirteen mu), but they had no house to live in. After discussion among the peasants, the landlord Liu Deqing's thatched house was temporarily given to Zhang Zihou's family to live in, but the property rights were not determined. In 1949, Liu Deqing and Zhang Zihou had a dispute over the house. District Chief Du Jiunian (who was transferred to work in the county before the new year) and Civil Affairs Assistant Xiao (previously mistakenly written as Xia) Hengrui (who has retired and returned home) resolved this issue in the district and village, but because the two were very familiar with Liu Deqing, they insisted that the house should still belong to Liu Deqing. Subsequently, they instructed the village to fill out a land certificate for him and forced the village cadres to do so (the county did not know about this at the time). Later, the county government received a letter from Zhang Zihou from the army and immediately instructed the Fifth District to deal with it appropriately based on the actual situation, but the district did not comply and did not report to the county; and the county leadership had a serious bureaucratic work style and did not investigate the matter in a timely manner, which was delayed. This was wrong.
    After we clarified the matter this time, the county and district cadres convened a cadre meeting in the village, exposed the past mistakes of Du and Xiao, and decided to return the house to Zhang Zihou. Liu Deqing was ordered to hand over the land certificate. Another one was filled out for Zhang Zihou, and it was approved by the county, numbered and stamped. This is the handling of the house problem.
    As for the landlord Liu Deqing's counter-attack, after investigation by all parties, the main fault lies with Du Jiunian and Xiao Hengrui, because they gave the landlord Liu Deqing an opportunity to exploit. Considering that Liu Deqing's usual performance was acceptable, he was allowed to be treated leniently. In addition to pointing out his past wrong actions to his face and giving him strict criticism and education, he was also ordered to apologize to Zhang Zihou's family (Zhang Zihou's family has no objections). At the same time, it was decided to announce the handling results of the matter to the masses in order to clarify the law and discipline and educate cadres and the masses.

　　易县五区地主反攻事件该县县长来信报告处理结果编者同志：
    读了七月三日贵刊登载的“地主向翻身农民反攻，易县五区张子厚来信申诉”一文后，本府当即派民政科员赵贺柱，协同村干部前往潦水村调查，事情真相与报纸所登情况基本符合，并已作处理。
    张子厚系潦水人，于一九三七年全家（八口）迁至本县西陵太平峪村安居。买房两间，地十来亩（在潦水村还有八亩地，没有房）。至一九四六年土地改革时，张子厚家四口人又搬回潦水村，分得五亩地（连原有地十三亩），但没有房屋住。经农民讨论后，将地主刘德庆的一间草房暂让给张子厚家住上，但并未确定产权。一九四九年刘德庆和张子厚因房子问题起了纠纷，先后经区长杜久年（已于年前调定县工作）和民政助理肖（前误为夏）恒瑞（已退职回家）在区、村解决这一问题，但因该二人与刘德庆很熟，就主张将房仍归刘德庆所有，随后并指示村里给其填写土地证，并迫使村干部照办（当时县不知道）。后来县府接张子厚从部队写来的信，当即指示五区依据实情适当处理，但区里并不遵办，且未向县报告；而县领导机关存在严重官僚主义作风，未及时查究此事，一直拖延下来。这是错误的。
    我们此次把事情调查清楚了之后，县区干部在该村召集了干部会议，把过去杜、肖二人的错误予以揭发，并决定将房屋重归张子厚所有。令刘德庆将土地证交出。另给张子厚填上，并经县批准，编号盖印。这是关于房屋问题的处理。
    至于地主刘德庆反攻问题，经各方调查，主要错误还在杜久年和肖恒瑞身上，因他们给了地主刘德庆可乘之机。因念刘德庆平素表现尚好，准予从轻处理。除当面指出其过去错误行动，予以严格批评教育外，并令其向张子厚家赔情道歉（张子厚家已无意见）。同时决定将该事处理结果向群众公布，以严明法纪，教育干部和群众。
