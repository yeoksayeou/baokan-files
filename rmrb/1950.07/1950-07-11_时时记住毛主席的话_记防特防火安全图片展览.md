　　Always Remember Chairman Mao's Words
    Record of the Anti-Espionage, Fire Prevention, and Safety Picture Exhibition
    By Our Reporter Pei Lan
    “The war has basically ended on the mainland, only Taiwan and Tibet remain to be liberated, which are still serious tasks of struggle. The Kuomintang reactionaries have adopted the method of bandit guerrilla warfare in some areas of the mainland, inciting a part of the backward elements to fight against the People's Government. The Kuomintang reactionaries have also organized many secret special agents and spies to oppose the People's Government, spread rumors among the people, and attempt to undermine the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and to alienate the unity and cooperation of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations. The special agents and spies have also carried out activities to sabotage the people's economic undertakings, and have adopted assassination tactics against the personnel of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and have collected intelligence for the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. All these counter-revolutionary activities are instigated behind the scenes by imperialism, especially American imperialism. These bandits, special agents and spies are all running dogs of imperialism."
    "Now the People's Liberation Army still has the task of continuing to wipe out the remaining bandits in the newly liberated areas, and the People's Public Security Organs have the task of continuing to crack down on the enemy's special agent organizations."
    (Excerpt from Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC)
    Since the liberation of Beijing, the Municipal Public Security Organs and Public Security Forces, with the assistance of the broad masses, have launched a strong anti-espionage struggle, giving a severe blow to the special agents lurking in Beijing. However, the remaining special agents have not given up, and they are still trying every means to spread rumors, spy on military intelligence, assassinate revolutionary cadres, infiltrate factories, and sabotage production and construction in a lurking and concealed manner. The main purpose of the "Anti-Espionage, Fire Prevention, and Safety Picture Exhibition" recently held by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau in the Labor People's Cultural Palace is to raise the vigilance of the masses and educate the broad masses to always remember Chairman Mao's words and strengthen anti-espionage work.
            Iron Evidence of Harming the People
    From the pictures in the exhibition, we saw how the special agents and bandits jointly directed by the US imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek harmed the Chinese people. One photo reproduced the certificate issued by the Ping Branch of the Intelligence Liaison Office of the US Secretary of the Army to the special agent Xiong Xianli, which reads: "Mr. Xiong Xianli is an employee of the Ping Branch of the US Military Intelligence Liaison Office, responsible for handling affairs on behalf of this office. Any assistance given to Xiong by relevant agencies is also assistance to this office, which is expected and appreciated by this office." US imperialism instructed Xiong Xianli to establish an intelligence organization and set up a radio station to report intelligence to the United States. In order to establish a permanent intelligence base, Xiong planned to "establish an enterprise-like trading company as a cover for work." A head office was set up in Tianjin, and seven branch offices were set up in Beijing, Tangshan, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Dalian, and "another CCP area" to cover up activities. Before the liberation of Beijing, Ma Ci, the liaison officer of the US Intelligence Office Shanghai Headquarters, telegraphed Xiong, ordering him to set up a radio station in a reliable location after the liberation of Beijing to continue to contact Shanghai and provide intelligence to the United States.
    In China, the United States, through its embassies, consulates, news agencies, and some overseas Chinese, "cooperated" with the traitorous Kuomintang reactionaries to conduct espionage activities. The arrested bandit Xiong Xianli was just one of them.
    Dozens of photos and paintings truly exposed the sabotage activities of the Kuomintang Secrecy Bureau (Military Command) and the Party Affairs Investigation Bureau (Central Command) special agents in Beijing. In April of last year, special agents burned down fifty-nine trams, and then sabotaged the No. 6 generator in Shijingshan. Chen Jihan, a special agent of the Military Command's Technical General Team, instigated Xu Zhenglu to murder our revolutionary cadre Wang Zhenzhong in the woods at night. Special agents even infiltrated the Xiangshan Ciyouyuan (Orphanage), released poison, and attempted to kill innocent children. The iron facts are in front of the people, and these criminal acts of the special agents will never be tolerated by the people.
    The exhibition has all the photos of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Ji Zhaoxiang case. After the liberation of Beijing, Ji used various methods to infiltrate the North China National Medical College and the China Pottery Company as a cover to spy on our military secrets, government organizations, aviation equipment, and the movements of our senior cadres, and provide important intelligence to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan. The murderer Zhai Yuwei successively served as the captain of the Third Detachment of the Puppet 69th Army, the commander of the Puppet Shandong Security Brigade, etc., colluding with the Japanese invaders to organize the "Bandit Suppression and National Salvation Army" and the special agent brigade to invade our liberated areas and carry out large-scale burning and killing. After "August 15th," Zhai continued to serve as the commander of the Puppet Jinan Suburban Garrison, and still used his special agent brigade to sneak into our Zhangqiu and Licheng areas and carry out large-scale sabotage. After the liberation of Jinan, Zhai fled to Beijing and infiltrated the Teachers College, attempting to cover up his crimes as a student and continue to carry out sabotage activities.
    These special agents and bandits were even more brutal before liberation. When the special agent Wang Zhen was working as a special agent at Chaoyang University, he privately set up a criminal court, arbitrarily inspected, arrested, and beat classmates or professors, and insulted female classmates. He also robbed the Daqing Rice Store and ordered the store clerk to send ten bags of flour to the school.
            American-Made Killing Weapons
    What weapons did the special agents directed by the US imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek use to massacre the Chinese people? An unarmed pistol is displayed in the exhibition hall. Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu were killed by this unarmed pistol. The killing weapons supplied by the US imperialists to the Chiang Kai-shek special agents include assassination bullets, American-made Chicago-style special agent pistols, flat special agent pistols, pen guns, daggers, dagger guns, etc., which are too numerous to mention. These killing weapons have poisoned many heroic revolutionary fighters and many innocent Chinese people. The viciousness of Chiang and the United States is beyond our imagination. There are two canes and a whip in the picture. Are these really canes and whips? No, if you look closely, there are triggers, chambers, and muzzles, everything. These are killing weapons!
            Can't Escape the Hands of the People
    Before liberation, the special agent organizations distributed in Beijing included the North China Supervision Office, the North China Special Station, the Beiping Branch, the Hebei Provincial Office, and the organizations in various districts within Beiping, all under the direction of the Secrecy Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. There were also organizations such as the Jireliaocha Border Area Special Station that fled to Beiping from Northeast China, Hebei, Shanxi, and Chahar. What deserves our attention even more is the Beiping General Branch of the US Strategic Intelligence Office. Recently, with the help of the US imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek sent a large number of special agents from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, carrying radio stations, poisons, explosives, weapons, and funds for activities, sneaking into Beijing to carry out sabotage activities. Let us solemnly tell the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek murderers that your attempts to harm the people will ultimately not escape the hands of the people!
    After the liberation of Beijing, with the concerted efforts of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Organs and Public Security Forces, and the broad masses of workers, the special agent organizations were successively destroyed, and 173 major special agent sabotage cases were solved, 985 special agents were arrested, more than 2,000 special agent elements were concentrated for management and training, and more than 3,000 self-reformed elements were registered; more than 400 radio stations and more than 1,500 guns were seized.
            Organize to Prevent Espionage and Fire
    In the year since the liberation of Beijing, mass anti-espionage, fire prevention, and safety and security work has been carried out in factories, mines, and enterprises. The workers protect their factories with the attitude of masters. Hu Quangui, the chairman of the tram company's South Repair Factory Trade Union, said at the founding meeting of the safety team: "The factory is our home, and the property of the factory is our property. Everyone has the responsibility to protect it."
    In order to protect the property of the country, male and female workers in factories, mines, and enterprises stand guard and patrol day and night. Holding weapons, they go back and forth in the factory, carefully and responsibly watching the passing pedestrians. Some safety teams discuss how to do a good job in security work during rest time. The workers have played a high pioneering role of the proletariat.
    After liberation, with the joint efforts of the Party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues of factories, mines, and enterprises stationed in Beijing and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, mass safety organizations were generally established, and safety committees were established, specifically formulated draft safety organizations, and clearly put forward that the task of the safety team is to prevent espionage, fire, air raids, theft, and accidents. The conditions, rights, and obligations of the members of the safety team were carefully studied. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and Power Plant have also established a handover system, a machine safety responsibility system, and mass covenants such as warehouses and gatekeepers. The tram company and the automobile company have also established safety teams on the roads and implemented mutual assistance, supervision, inspection, and responsibility safety systems.
    Now, more than ten units, including the Water Supply Company, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, and the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, are also actively establishing or improving safety organizations.

　　时时记住毛主席的话
    记防特防火安全图片展览
    本报记者  培蓝
    “战争已在大陆上基本结束，只有台湾和西藏还待解放，还是一个严重的斗争任务。国民党反动派在大陆若干地区内采取了土匪游击战争的方式，煽动了一部分落后分子，和人民政府作斗争。国民党反动派又组织许多秘密的特务分子和间谍分子反对人民政府，在人民中散布谣言，企图破坏共产党和人民政府的威信，企图离间各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结和合作。特务和间谍们又进行了破坏人民经济事业的活动，对于共产党和人民政府的工作人员采取暗杀手段，为帝国主义和国民党反动派收集情报。所有这些反革命活动，都有帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在背后策动。这些土匪、特务和间谍，都是帝国主义的走狗。”
    “现在人民解放军在新解放区仍有继续剿灭残余土匪的任务，人民公安机关则有继续打击敌人特务组织的任务。”
    （摘自毛主席在中共三中全会上的报告）
    北京解放以后，市公安机关和公安部队在广大群众协助下，展开了强有力的反特务斗争，给予潜伏在北京的特务以严重打击。但是，残余的特务分子并未死心，他们还在千方百计地以潜伏隐蔽的活动方式，散布谣言，刺探军情，谋杀革命干部，混入工厂，破坏生产建设。京市公安总局最近在劳动人民文化宫举办的“防特防火安全图片展览”的主要目的，就在于提高群众的警惕，教育广大群众，时时记住毛主席的话，加强防特工作。
            残害人民的铁证
    从展览的图片里，我们看到了美帝蒋匪共同指使的特务匪徒，是怎样残害中国人民的。一张照片影印出美国军政部长补助室情报联络处驻平分处，给予特务熊先立的证明书，上面写着；“熊先立君为美军情报联络处驻平分处职员，负责代本处办理事务，如有关机关予熊之援助，亦即予本处之援助，该项援助为本处之期待及感佩。”美帝指使熊先立，建立情报组织，设立电台，向美国报告情报。熊匪为建立永久性的情报基础，拟“设立企业性的贸易公司为工作之掩护。”在天津设总公司，北京、唐山、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、大连及“另一中共区内”，设七个分公司，掩护活动。京市解放前，美帝情报处上海总部联络官马慈曾电熊犯，令其在北京解放后，将电台分设于可靠地点，继续与上海联络，供给美方情报。
    美帝在中国通过其大使馆、领事馆、新闻处及若干侨民，与卖国的国民党反动派“合作”，进行特务间谍活动。被捕的熊匪先立，只不过是其中的一个而已。
    几十幅照片和绘画，真实地暴露了国民党保密局（军统）、党通局（中统）特务在北京的破坏活动。去年四月，特务烧毁了五十九辆电车，接着又破坏了石景山的六号发电机。军统系技术总队特务陈济汉主使徐正禄，黑夜里在树林中杀害我革命干部王振中。特务甚至混入香山慈幼院，撒放毒药，企图杀害无辜的儿童。铁的事实摆在人民的面前，特务们这些罪恶行为，是决不会得到人民的宽容的。
    展览会中有蒋匪特务计兆祥案的全部照片。计匪在北京解放后，利用各种方法，混入华北国医学院及中华窑业公司作掩护，刺探我军事机密、政府组织、航空设备，以及我方高级干部的行止等重要情报，供给台湾蒋匪。杀人凶犯翟毓蔚，先后充当伪六十九军第三支队队长，伪山东保安旅长等职，勾结日寇，组织“剿匪救国军”及特务大队，进犯我解放区，大烧大杀。“八一五”后，翟犯继任伪济南城郊警备司令，仍主使其特务大队，潜入我章邱、历城地区，大肆破坏。济南解放后，翟犯逃到北京，混入师大，企图以学生面貌掩护其罪恶，继续进行破坏活动。
    这些特务匪徒们，在解放前更是凶暴。特务王镇，在朝阳大学作特务工作时，私设刑庭，任意检查、逮捕、毒打同学或教授，污辱女同学。并抢劫大庆米庄，命令该店店员将十袋面粉送到学校。
            美国造的杀人武器
    美帝和蒋匪指使下的特务们，用什么武器来屠杀中国人民呢？展览室里陈列着一支无声手枪，闻一多、李公朴就是被这种无声手枪打死的。美帝供给蒋匪特务用的杀人武器，有暗杀弹、美制芝加哥式特工手枪、扁形特工手枪、钢笔枪、匕首、匕首枪等等，实在是举不胜举。这些杀人武器，不知毒害了多少英勇的革命战士和多少无辜的中国人民。蒋美的毒辣是我们难以想像到的，图片上按放着两支手杖、一条马鞭。这真是手杖和马鞭吗？不，你仔细看去，搬机、弹膛、枪口，样样都有，这是杀人的武器啊！
            逃不出人民之手
    解放前分布在京市的特务组织，除驻平各机关，如国防部保密局指使下的华北督导室、华北特别站、北平支台、河北省室以及分布在北平境内各区的组织外；还有由东北、河北、山西、察哈尔逃入北平的冀热辽察边区特别站等组织单位。更值得我们注意的，是美国战略情报处北平总支部。最近美帝帮助蒋匪由台湾、香港及南朝鲜等地，派来大批特务，携带电台、毒药、炸药、武器和用作活动经费的款项等，潜入北京、进行破坏活动。让我们严正地告诉美帝国主义者及蒋匪杀人凶手们，你们这些残害人民的企图，是终归逃不出人民之手的！
    北京解放后，在京市公安机关和公安部队，及广大工人、群众的同心合力下，相继摧毁了特务的组织，破获重大特务破坏活动案达一百七十三起，逮捕特务九百八十五名，另集中管训特务分子二千多名，登记自新分子三千多名；缴获电台四百余架，枪械一千五百余支。
            组织起来，防特防火
    北京解放一年来，在工厂、矿山、企业开展了群众性的防特防火安全保卫工作。工人们以主人翁的态度，保卫自己的工厂。电车公司南修造厂工会主任胡泉桂，在成立安全小组会上说：“工厂就是我们的家，工厂的财产就是我们的财产，大家都有责任保护。”
    为了保护国家的财产，工、矿、企业里的男工女工，日夜站岗、巡逻。他（她）们拿着武器，在厂内来来去去，认真负责地注视着来往行人。有的安全小组，在休息时间，讨论如何作好保卫工作，工人们发挥了无产阶级的高度的先锋作用。
    解放后，北京驻地的各工厂、矿山、企业的党、政、工、团和市公安总局的共同努力，普遍建立了群众性的安全组织，并成立了安全委员会，具体拟定了安全组织草案，明确提出安全小组的任务是防特、防火、防空、防盗、防事故等。缜密研究出安全小组组员的条件、权利和义务。石景山钢铁厂、发电厂并订出接交班制度、机器安全责任制，及仓库、门卫等群众性的公约。电车公司、汽车公司并建立了车路上的安全小组，实行互助督促检查及责任安全制。
    现在，自来水公司、北京电信局、北京电业局等十余单位也正在积极建立或健全安全组织。
