Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd—People from all walks of life in East China are extremely angry at the American invasion of Taiwan and have expressed their opinions, stating their determination to liberate Taiwan.

　　The people of Shanghai mostly held discussion meetings separately and carried out in-depth propaganda in various neighborhoods. Residents of Baoyu Lane launched a peace signature campaign to express their determination to stop imperialist aggression. The women of the lane also published a letter to mothers, calling on mothers around the world to sign the peace declaration and not allow their children to become victims of warmongers. Wu Yaozong of the National YMCA of China called on Christians throughout China to unite and resolutely oppose American aggression, and called on peace-loving Christians around the world and in the United States to use effective actions to crush the crimes of American imperialism in creating war.

　　Local organizations of various democratic parties in Nanjing have issued statements denouncing this provocative act by the United States as a determination to be enemies with the people of China and the East. They also called on members of their respective parties and leagues to further launch a peace signature campaign to strengthen the power to defend world peace. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Preparatory Committee of the Farmers' Association called on workers in factories and farmers in the suburbs to step up production, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and defeat the provocations of American imperialism. Other groups and democrats have also issued talks and statements.

　　People's organizations in Jinan and Qingdao, Shandong Province, issued statements unanimously pointing out that American imperialism, this paper tiger, is not to be feared, and it will never scare the victorious Chinese people. All the sailors of the Qingdao Seamen's Union stated that they would continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the seamen, unite the seamen brothers at home and abroad, and work hard to defend world peace and support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea to liberate Taiwan. The Qingdao branch of the China Democratic League issued a written statement saying: The U.S. imperialism's adoption of such arrogant and despicable means cannot intimidate the people of the world. As early as May 1949, the US Seventh Fleet claimed to be "stationed in Qingdao for a long time", but under the shock of the great victory of the People's Liberation War, it slipped away like a drowned dog. It will not work to bark back today.

　　上海南京济南青岛各界人民
    对美帝侵台极度愤怒  决心一定要解放台湾
    【新华社上海二日电】华东区各界人民对美国侵略台湾的行动感到极度的愤怒，纷纷发表意见，表示一定要解放台湾的决心。
    上海市人民大都为此分别举行了座谈会，并深入各里弄进行宣传。宝裕里居民以展开和平签名运动，来表示制止帝国主义侵略的决心。该里妇女并发表告母亲书，呼吁全世界的母亲们在和平宣言上签名，勿使自己的子女作战争贩子的牺牲者。中华基督教青年会吴耀宗号召全中国的基督教徒团结起来，坚决反对美国的侵略，并号召全世界和美国爱好和平的基督教徒，用有效的行动粉碎美帝国主义制造战争的罪行。
    南京各民主党派的地方组织均发表声明，指斥美国这一挑衅行为，乃是决心与中国及东方人民为敌。并号召各该党派的党员、盟员进一步展开和平签名运动，加强保卫世界和平的力量。市总工会和农民协会筹委会号召各工厂工人和郊区农民加紧生产，支援解放军解放台湾，打败美帝国主义的挑衅。其他各团体和民主人士都发表了谈话和声明。
    山东省济南市和青岛市的各人民团体发表声明，一致指出美帝国主义这只纸老虎并不可怕，它绝吓不倒胜利了的中国人民。青岛市海员工会全体海员表示要继续发扬海员光荣的革命传统，团结国内和国际的海员兄弟，为保卫世界和平和支援解放军渡海解放台湾而努力。中国民主同盟青市支部发表书面谈话称：美帝采取这种狂妄卑劣的手段，是恫吓不了全世界人民的。早于一九四九年五月间，美国第七舰队曾声称“长期留驻青岛”，但在人民解放战争伟大胜利的震慑下，它就像只落水狗似的溜走了。今天回过头来狂吠，这是起不了什么作用的。
