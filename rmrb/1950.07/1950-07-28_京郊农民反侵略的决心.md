The Determination of Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing to Resist Aggression
By our reporter Pei Lan

"We pledge to be the strong backing of the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly liberate Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and drive out American imperialism!" This is the unanimous call of the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing.

Liu Hengbo, the Communist Party branch secretary of Balizhuang, said, "If we all rise up to defend world peace, we can stop wars of aggression." Several farmers in their thirties, recalling their lives, said, "We haven't had a single day of peace since we were little. Today, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought us peace. We must work hard for peace and a happy new life."

Speaking of building a free and happy new life and building a new China, the village cadres of Balizhuang unanimously stated: We not only have food and clothing, but under the leadership of the People's Government, the children of us working people can also learn culture. This is something we could never have hoped for in several lifetimes. In the past, the village only had a private school, which was a place where only the children of wealthy people could study. Now the government has helped establish elementary schools, and the children of working people are the first to enroll. The masses in Balizhuang are in a particularly high mood for production. Men and women, old and young, from elders in their sixties to children of twelve and thirteen, are all working in the fields. Even the daughters and wives of landlords and rich peasants, who never participated in any labor in the past, are now working hard in production. There are also a large number of young and middle-aged people who are actively and enthusiastically participating in construction projects such as digging ditches and building roads in the capital. The masses have a common belief, that is, if we do a good job in production, we can live a happy life in another two or three years.

For the sake of the next generation, for a happier life for themselves, this is why the farmers in the suburbs hate the aggression of American imperialists. In order to express their strength in defending peace, the farmers in the suburbs enthusiastically responded to the peace signature campaign. Villages such as Balizhuang and Ciyunsi held mass meetings of more than 4,000 people. At the meetings, the masses loudly declared that we represent four administrative villages and 20,000 working people, calling for peace. Everyone signed their names on the peace signature book, and many young people signed on behalf of their elderly parents, and mothers signed on behalf of infants less than one year old.

The farmers in the suburbs are deeply concerned about the victory of the Korean people. They believe that the Korean people, like us, will soon drive out the American imperialists and eliminate Syngman Rhee. Feng Wenliang, an elderly man with gray hair, recounted the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Beijing. He said with emotion, "I have lived for seventy-three years and have never seen such a good army. The Communist Party's politics are good. Wherever the Communist Party goes, there will be victory."

The farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are extremely indignant at the American imperialists' arrogant actions of invading Taiwan. They resolutely stated: "It is forever impossible for the American imperialists to occupy Taiwan. We farmers will put down our hoes and sickles, pick up guns and cannons, and organize ourselves into a powerful reserve force for the People's Liberation Army."

　　京郊农民反侵略的决心
    本报记者  培蓝
    “我们誓作人民解放军的后盾，彻底解放台湾，活捉蒋介石，赶走美帝国主义”，这是京郊农民一致的呼声。
    八里庄中共支部书记刘恒博说：“我们大家都起来保卫世界和平，就能制止侵略战争。”几个三十来岁的农民，回忆起自己的一生说：“我们从小就没有过一天安宁日子，今天，共产党、毛主席给我们带来了和平，我们要为和平、幸福的新生活而努力。”
    提起建设自由、幸福的新生活，建设新中国，八里庄的村干部一致表示：我们不仅有吃有穿，在人民政府的领导下，我们这些劳动人民的子弟也可以学习文化了，这真是几辈子盼不着的事。过去该村只有一所私塾，那是有钱人的子弟才能读书的地方，现在政府帮助建立了小学校，劳动人民的子弟首先入学了。八里庄群众生产情绪特别高，全村男女老少，从六十多岁的老人，至十二、三岁的小孩都下地生产了，连过去根本不参加任何劳动的地、富家里的姑娘媳妇，今天生产也顶起劲，还有大批的青壮年，积极热情地参加首都挖沟、修路等建设工程。群众们有一个共同的信念，那就是把生产搞好，再过两三年，就能过美满的生活。
    为了后一代，为了自己过更加幸福的生活，这就是郊区农民痛恨美帝国主义者侵略的原因。为了表示对于保卫和平的力量，郊区农民热烈响应了和平签名运动。八里庄、慈云寺等村曾召开了四千多人的群众大会，群众在大会上响亮的提出，我们代表着四个行政村、两万多劳动人民，呼吁和平。每个人都在和平签名册上写下了自己的名字，还有好多青年代替年老的父母，母亲代替不满一周岁的婴儿签名。
    郊区农民深切关怀着朝鲜人民的胜利，他们相信，朝鲜人民和我们一样，是会很快赶走美帝，消灭李承晚的。头发斑白的老年人冯文亮，叙述了人民解放军解放北京的英勇事迹后，他感动地说：“我活了七十三岁，没有见过这样好的军队，共产党政治好，共产党到那里，那里就能胜利。”
    京郊的农民对于美帝侵略台湾的狂妄行动愤慨万分，他们坚决表示：“美帝想侵占台湾，那是永远不可能的，我们农民们，放下锄头、镰刀，拿起枪炮，组织起来，就是一支强大的人民解放军的后备力量。”
