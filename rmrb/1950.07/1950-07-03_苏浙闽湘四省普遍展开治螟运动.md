　　The Four Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan
　　Universally Launch Anti-Rice Stem Borer Campaign
　　[This newspaper reports] In order to eliminate pests and protect rice seedlings, the vast number of farmers in southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan provinces, under the leadership of people's governments and Party committees at all levels, have launched a large-scale anti-rice stem borer campaign since May.
　　In recent years, many areas in Hunan have repeatedly experienced insect infestations, resulting in significant losses in rice harvests. According to statistics from the province's Department of Agriculture, the average annual loss of rice due to rice stem borer damage accounts for more than 15% of the total yield, with Shaoyang County experiencing a loss of as much as 30% of the yield in 1941. Recently, rice stem borers have been successively discovered in various locations. This year, Zhenzhong Township in Shaoyang has a particularly large number of rice stem borers. In Renshou Township, Dong'an, the number of rice stem borers has increased dozens of times every day for three days. Leadership organs in areas with severe rice stem borer damage have taken emergency measures to eliminate them. The Yiyang Prefecture used concrete calculations of the rapid reproduction of rice stem borers to illustrate the magnitude of the damage, mobilizing cadres and the masses to work together to control the pests, and adopting various methods to vigorously capture them. Dayao Township in Liuyang has already captured 2.8 million rice stem borers. Over 70% of the township's fields have adopted methods such as weeding, irrigation, and soil soaking to eliminate the pests. In carrying out the anti-rice stem borer campaign in Liling, mobilization and organization work was conducted through farmer representatives and village agricultural associations. For example, representative Tian Yousheng promoted rice stem borer elimination upon returning to the village and demonstrated the effectiveness of lure lamps, catching more than 300 insects in one night, which motivated the entire village to actively hunt and kill them.
　　Fujian has achieved preliminary victory in the rice stem borer elimination work. In mid-February, the province's Department of Agriculture and Forestry first selected Minhou, Changle, and Fuzhou City, which have historically suffered the most severe rice stem borer damage, as typical work areas. Ten rice stem borer prevention and control teams were formed, consisting of students from the Department of Plant Pathology and Entomology of the Agricultural College and technical cadres, and sent to the countryside to organize rice stem borer control committees and guide farmers in rice stem borer control.
　　The first rice stem borer in Zhejiang was discovered on May 5th. On May 11th, the provincial government issued an emergency mobilization order for a concentrated egg collection and moth catching campaign, calling on the masses to launch a "everyone participates, every household controls rice stem borers" movement, and stipulated reward and punishment measures. Efforts were made to clear the egg masses in the seedling fields in about half a month. Currently, Jiaxing Prefecture has collected 7.71 million egg masses and captured more than 5 million moths. In the Mashan district of Shaoxing, more than 1,000 mu of suitable seedling fields have been prepared, accounting for more than 58% of the area of seedling fields in the district.
　　The occurrence of rice stem borer in southern Jiangsu was later. After the conclusion of the rice stem borer control meeting at the end of March, the district issued this year's rice stem borer control plan, focusing on egg collection and moth catching in seedling fields. A new experience was also created, which is to select early-season rice and late-season rice varieties to avoid rice stem borer damage. Many areas have switched from medium-maturing rice to early-season rice.
　　In carrying out the rice stem borer control campaign, the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian successively established technical guidance stations for plant disease and insect pest control, cooperating with the rice stem borer control committees and pest control headquarters in various counties to carry out egg collection and moth catching work.
　　At present, due to the earnest leadership of governments at all levels and the increased awareness of the masses about rice stem borer damage, the rice stem borer control campaign has been universally launched in various regions, and particularly great achievements have been made in some typical areas.

　　苏浙闽湘四省
    普遍展开治螟运动
    【本报讯】为扑灭害虫，保护禾苗，苏南、浙江、福建、湖南等省广大农民，在各级人民政府及各级党委领导下，自五月以来，展开了大规模的治螟运动。
    湖南近年来不少地区曾多次发生虫害，稻谷收成损失颇重，据该省农业厅统计，全省每年因螟害而损失的稻谷平均在产量的百分之十五以上，邵阳县一九四一年损失竟达产量的百分之三十。近来各地又相继发现螟虫，邵阳震中乡今年螟虫特别多；东安仁寿乡螟虫在三天中每天都增加数十倍。螟害严重的地区领导机关已采取紧急措施进行灭螟。益阳专署用具体计算螟虫繁殖的迅速情况，说明螟虫危害之大，以发动干部、群众合力治螟，采取各种办法大力捕捉。浏阳大瑶乡已捕捉螟虫二百八十万个，该乡已有百分之七十以上的田地，采用除草、灌水、浸土等方法进行灭螟。醴陵在开展治螟运动中，通过农民代表和村农协进行动员和组织工作。如代表田又生回村后即宣传灭螟，并点诱蛾灯试验给大家看，一晚捕三百多只，带动了全村群众都积极捕杀。
    福建灭螟工作已获初步胜利。二月中旬，该省农林处首先选择历年螟害最烈的闽侯、长乐及福州市为典型工作地区，抽调农学院病虫系学生及技术干部组成十个螟虫防治队，下乡组织治螟委员会，指导农民治螟。
    浙江第一个三化螟是五月五日发现的。省府于五月十一日即颁布突击采卵捕蛾紧急动员令，号召群众展开“人人动手、家家治螟”运动，并规定惩奖办法。争取半月左右将秧田的卵块肃清。现嘉兴专区已采卵七百七十一万块，捕蛾五百余万只。绍兴马山区十三个乡已做好合式秧田一千余亩，占该区秧田面积百分之五十八强。
    苏南三化螟发生较晚。该区自三月底治螟会议闭幕后，即发出本年治螟方案，以秧田采卵捕蛾为重点，还创造了一套新经验，就是选种早早稻和晚晚稻，以避免螟害，不少地区已把中熟稻改种早稻。
    在开展治螟运动中，苏浙闽三省先后成立了病虫防治等技术指导站，配合了各县治螟委员会和除虫指挥部的采卵捕蛾工作。
    目前各地区治螟运动，由于各级政府认真领导，与群众对螟害的认识提高，工作已普遍开展，特别是有些典型地区已获得很大成绩。（解放日报、长江日报、虞路文）
