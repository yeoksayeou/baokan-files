　　Zhao Guilan's Heroic Actions are Qualities That Communist Party Members Should Possess
    ——A Summary of the Discussion “Should Zhao Guilan Have Thrown the Fulminate of Mercury?”
    Editorial Department of This Newspaper
    After this newspaper published a report on March 1 about the selfless factory protection act of Comrade Zhao Guilan, a female worker and Communist Party member at the Dalian Chemical Plant, readers from all over sent letters expressing their condolences and respect to Comrade Zhao Guilan. This also sparked a debate on the question of "Should Zhao Guilan Have Thrown the Fulminate of Mercury?". Many readers participated enthusiastically in the discussion with the utmost concern. In over a hundred letters (of which seventy-seven were sent after April 13), 90% agreed with Comrade Zhao Guilan's actions. However, a small number of people held different opinions, believing that while Comrade Zhao Guilan's spirit was admirable, her actions were worth considering further.

    Some people thought that Comrade Zhao Guilan's actions were a "waste of life." Their reasoning was that Communist Party members should not forget their future "tasks" and should not easily sacrifice themselves for "unworthy" things. In reality, Zhao Guilan's act of not throwing the fulminate of mercury was not a waste of life, but rather the most rational use of it. A Communist Party member should use their life when the cause of the Party and the people needs them most. In the situation that Comrade Zhao Guilan encountered, when protecting her own life and protecting state property were in conflict, it was only natural for her – a Communist Party member – to sacrifice herself for the public good. If a Party member in a factory could adopt an irresponsible attitude towards their own factory, then what else would be worth sacrificing for, and what task would be more important?! These people take revolutionary interests too lightly and personal interests too seriously. Of course, we never advocate that Communist Party members sacrifice themselves without principle. But we must affirm a principle: in all circumstances (including the most dangerous), Party members should persist in working for the interests of the Party and the people, and be prepared to sacrifice everything for it – including their lives.

    Some people believed that cadres are more important than machines and that cadres should not be sacrificed to preserve some machines. Their reasoning was that machines are created by cadres, and "cadres determine everything." In reality, these people do not understand how cadres determine the revolutionary cause, and therefore they cannot understand that Comrade Zhao Guilan's act of not throwing the fulminate of mercury is a good illustration of "cadres determine everything." It is precisely because we have cadres who are courageous in self-sacrifice that we can ensure that the country's economic construction cause is spared losses, and that the achievements of the people's revolutionary cause are "determined." Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in the chapter on the cadre question in "On the Party," explained the importance of cadres in this way: "In the twenty-four years of heroic struggle of our Party, a large number of cadres have been trained. For the sake of the interests of the people's liberation cause, they are courageous in self-sacrifice, creative, and persistent, and have demonstrated the noblest revolutionary qualities of the Chinese people. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, they 'are the treasure of the nation and the honor of the entire Party.'" He also pointed out that "In the past, without the sacrificial struggle of our Party's large number of cadres, the people's cause could not have achieved what it has today; in the future, without the concerted efforts of all the cadres of our Party, the people's liberation cannot be completely victorious." This means that cadres who are unwilling to sacrifice themselves can never "determine everything." "Cadres determine everything" should also not be understood as "protecting cadres for the sake of protecting cadres," or "everything for the sake of cadres."

    Indeed, machines are created by cadres, and the more people who use their labor to create machines, the more they cherish them. Machines are the product of labor, and they also embody the lives of workers (including cadres). Sacrificing oneself to protect the fruits of the labor of many people is right and worthwhile. Comrade Zhao Guilan's act of not throwing the fulminate of mercury protected the factory's machines and products, which in effect is equivalent to creating machines and products. What's more, her act of not throwing the fulminate of mercury not only protected machines and products, but also preserved the lives of many people in the factory. The situation she was in at the time was precisely a critical juncture that "determined everything." It is precisely because our Party has many good comrades like Zhao Guilan who are courageous in self-sacrifice that we can say "cadres determine everything"; otherwise, what practical significance would this sentence have?

    Some people regretted that Comrade Zhao Guilan did not have a good grasp of scientific knowledge. They said, wouldn't it have been better if Comrade Zhao Guilan could have had a good understanding of the properties of fulminate of mercury and taken precautions beforehand, or if she could have found a way to avoid or reduce the losses of this unfortunate accident after falling? This opinion is not very realistic. Zhao Guilan's act of not throwing the fulminate of mercury not only showed that she understood the properties of fulminate of mercury, but also showed that she understood the question of who mastering technology should serve. It was precisely because she clearly understood the properties of fulminate of mercury and the nature of the Jianxin Chemical Plant that she decided not to throw the fulminate of mercury. Because if the fulminate of mercury were thrown onto the studio, it would inevitably cause the burning and explosion of other drugs, and the result would be unimaginable. At the same time, if Comrade Zhao Guilan did not have a firm revolutionary outlook on life and only understood the properties of fulminate of mercury, in order to save herself, she might have thrown the fulminate of mercury out regardless of everything. She did not do this, which shows that a Communist Party member should not only have a good grasp of scientific knowledge, but also clearly recognize who scientific knowledge serves. Of course, Comrade Zhao Guilan should have tried to protect herself without harming the factory. In fact, Comrade Zhao Guilan did so – when she decided not to throw the fulminate of mercury, she was also prepared to get up. Unfortunately, before she could get up, the fulminate of mercury exploded. (As for some readers' suggestions that Jianxin Factory and factories across the country should learn from Comrade Zhao Guilan's incident, better strengthen factory safety equipment, and educate employees to master scientific knowledge in order to avoid or reduce the occurrence of accidents, this is naturally very necessary.)

    Some people believed that Comrade Zhao Guilan should not have insisted on working while sick, and that the factory administration should have stopped her. They felt that if she had rested when she was sick, could the occurrence of this accident have been avoided? However, the work needed her, and there was indeed no one else who could replace her at the time. At this time, as long as a Communist Party member is still able to work, they should do their best to stick to their post and conscientiously do their job well. Not only should individual Party members demand this of themselves, but the leading organs should also fully demand that their cadres insist on working in this situation and do their job well. (This naturally does not mean that the leading organs can fail to pay attention to protecting the health of their cadres.) Otherwise, the slogan of the People's Liberation Army soldiers that "light injuries do not leave the front line" would also become wrong. The principle is very clear: "A Communist Party member should, at any time and on any issue, take into account the overall interests of the Party, put the interests of the Party first, and put personal problems and personal interests in a subordinate position." (Liu Shaoqi: On the Self-Cultivation of Communist Party Members)

    Zhao Guilan was right not to throw the fulminate of mercury. In our Party, this is not a miracle, but only one of the countless glorious deeds of Communist Party members shedding blood and sacrificing themselves for the revolutionary cause. Our Party has had countless outstanding cadres and Party members who, in various revolutionary periods and on various fronts, disregarded everything and sacrificed and struggled. And there have been countless martyrs who, in the courts, prisons, and execution grounds of the reactionaries, were unyielding and generously gave their lives; on the battlefields of revolutionary war, some consciously sacrificed themselves to complete their combat missions. These moving examples are endless. Communist Party members understand the highest meaning of life best. In their eyes, their own lives are the public property of the Party, and every bit of it must be dedicated to the cause of the Party. Therefore, they are best at protecting their own lives, and also most courageous in sacrificing their own lives. And all of this is in order to rationally use life in the place that is most beneficial to the cause of the Party and the people. The revolutionary martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves for the cause of the Party and the people are the ones who understand the precious meaning of life best, and are also the ones who know how to use life rationally. Without them, the victory of the revolution and the liberation of mankind would be unthinkable.

    However, there are still a few people in our Party who cannot unconditionally subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the Party. Some people, despite saying that they want to serve the people wholeheartedly, often use the excuse of protecting their health to avoid more arduous work, or work sloppily, fearing that they will "wear themselves out." Sometimes, when they have a little illness, they ask for a rest, and when they have recovered, they are unwilling to work, regarding their own bodies as more precious than revolutionary work. Some people demand personal material enjoyment, demand fame and status, etc. When these demands cannot be met, they become distressed and restless, wasting a lot of time and energy on these private matters without hesitation. Some people even become passive and degenerate because of this, casually ruining themselves. These people do not understand the true meaning of the life of a Communist Party member. They often see their own lives as more important than the cause of the Party and the people, and it is precisely they who seriously waste their own lives. They only want personal health and happiness, but it is precisely because of this that they often fall into the quagmire of decadence and烦恼.

    The greatest satisfaction and happiness for a Party member is to do a good job for the people and the Party. In order to create a better future for the masses of the people, every Communist Party member cannot abandon or relax the arduous work tasks in front of them for a moment. Every Communist Party member should learn well from Comrade Zhao Guilan, and even more so learn from the leaders and martyrs of the Party, and strive to be a good Communist Party member.

　　赵桂兰的英勇行为是共产党员应有的品质
    ——“赵桂兰应不应扔雷汞”讨论总结
    本报编辑部
    三月一日本报发表了大连化学配制女工、共产党员赵桂兰同志舍身护厂的报道后，各地读者纷纷来信向赵桂兰同志慰问致敬，同时也引起了“赵桂兰应不应扔雷汞”的争论。许多读者以最大的关心踊跃地参加了讨论。在百余件（其中有七十七件是四月十三日以后寄来的）来信中，百分之九十都同意赵桂兰同志的行为。但也有少数人持有不同意见，他们认为赵桂兰同志的精神虽然可佩，但她这样的行动则是值得考虑的。
    有些人以为赵桂兰同志这种作法是“对生命的浪费”。他们的理由是：共产党员不应该忘了自己将来的“任务”，而在“不值得”的事情上轻易牺牲自己。实际上，赵桂兰同志不扔雷汞不但不是对生命的浪费，而正是对生命的最合理的使用。一个共产党员应该把自己的生命使用在党和人民的事业最需要自己的时候。在赵桂兰同志当时遇到的情况下，在保护自己生命和保护国家财产发生矛盾的当儿，舍己从公，对于她——一个共产党员说来是理所当然的。假如一个工厂中的党员对于自己的工厂可以采取不负责任的态度的话，那么还有什么事情更值得牺牲，还有什么任务更加重要呢？！这些人把革命利益看得太轻，把个人的利益看得太大了。自然，我们也决不主张共产党员无原则地自我牺牲。但我们必须肯定一个原则：在一切场合（包括最危险的场合），党员应坚持为党和人民的利益而工作，并准备为此而牺牲自己的一切——包括生命在内。
    有些人以为干部比机器重要，不应当为保全一些机器而牺牲干部。理由是：机器是干部创造出来的，“干部决定一切”。实际上这些人是不懂得干部怎样决定革命事业的，因而他们就不能理解到赵桂兰同志不扔雷汞正是“干部决定一切”的一个很好的说明。正是因为有了这样勇于自我牺牲的干部，才能够保证使国家的经济建设事业免遭损失，才“决定”了人民革命事业的成就。刘少奇同志在《论党》中关于干部问题一章中是这样说明干部的重要性的：“我们党在二十四年的英勇斗争中，已经锻炼出大批的干部，他们为了人民解放事业的利益，勇于自我牺牲，富有创造性和坚持性，表现了中国人民最高贵的革命的品质，正如毛泽东同志所说，他们‘是民族的珍宝，全党的荣誉’。”并且指出：“在过去，没有我们党这大批干部的牺牲奋斗，人民事业就不能有今天这样的成就；在今后，如果没有我们党全体干部的一致努力，人民的解放就不能彻底胜利。”这就是说，不肯自我牺牲的干部，是决不能够“决定一切”的。“干部决定一切”也不应理解作“为爱护干部而爱护干部”，或是“一切为了干部”。
    不错，机器是干部创造的，而越是用自己的劳动创造机器的人，就越是爱护机器。机器是劳动的产品，也就凝结着工人（包括干部）的生命在内。牺牲自己去保卫许许多多人的劳动的成果，是应该的，也是值得的。赵桂兰同志不扔雷汞是保卫了工厂的机器与产品，实际上也就等于创造了机器和产品。更何况她不扔雷汞不止保卫了机器与产品，还保全了工厂中许多人的生命。她当时所处的情况，实在正是“决定一切”的关头。正是因为我们党有许多象赵桂兰同志这样勇于自我牺牲的好同志，我们才能说“干部决定一切”；不然，这句话又有什么实际意义呢？
    有些人惋惜赵桂兰同志没有很好地掌握科学知识。他们说，假如赵桂兰同志能很好地了解雷汞的性能而事先有所预防，或者是倒地后能设法避免或减轻这次不幸事故的损失不是更好吗？这个意见是不太合乎实际情况的。赵桂兰同志不扔雷汞不但表示她懂得雷汞的性能，并且表示出她懂得掌握技术为谁服务的问题。正因为她清楚地懂得雷汞的性能和建新化学厂的性质，她才决定了不扔雷汞。因为雷汞若是扔到工作室上，必将引起其他药物的燃烧爆炸，其结果将是不堪设想的。同时假如赵桂兰同志没有坚定的革命人生观而仅仅懂得雷汞的性能，为了保全自己，她也很可能不顾一切地把雷汞扔出去。她没有这样做，这正说明一个共产党员不但应该很好地掌握科学知识，还应该明确地认识科学知识是为谁服务的。自然赵桂兰同志还是应该在不损害工厂的情况下设法保全自己的，事实上赵桂兰同志也这样做了——当她决定不扔雷汞时，她还准备爬起。可惜，还没来得及爬起，雷汞就爆炸了。（至于有的读者建议建新工厂及各地工厂从赵桂兰同志这次事件中吸取教训，更好地加强工厂安全设备，教育职工掌握科学知识，以避免或减少事故的发生，这自然是十分必要的。）
    有些人认为赵桂兰同志不应带病坚持工作，工厂行政方面也应该制止她。他们觉得，假如她有病就休息，不是可以避免这次事故的发生吗？可是，工作需要她，而且当时确又无人可以接替。一个共产党员这时只要自己还能够工作，就应该尽最大努力坚守自己岗位，并且认真把工作做好。不但党员个人应该这样要求自己，领导机关在这种情况下也完全应该要求自己的干部坚持工作，并且把工作作好。（这自然不是说领导机关可以不注意保护自己干部的健康。）不然，人民解放军的战士“轻伤不下火线”的口号，也就成为错误的了。这道理是很明白的：“一个共产党员应该在任何时候、任何问题上都要估计到党的整个利益，都要把党的利益摆在前面，把个人的问题、个人利益摆在服从的地位。”（刘少奇：论共产党员的修养）
    赵桂兰同志不扔雷汞是对的。在我们党内，这并不是奇迹，而只是无数共产党员为革命事业流血牺牲的光辉事迹之一。我们的党，曾有无数优秀的干部和党员，在各个革命时期，在各个战线上，不顾一切，牺牲奋斗。而且有无数烈士，在反动派的法庭上、监狱中、刑场上，不屈不挠，慷慨就义；在革命战争的战场上，他们有的自觉地牺牲自己，完成战斗任务。这些可歌可泣的例子是说不尽的。共产党员最懂得生命的最高意义。在他们眼里看来，自己的生命乃是党的公共财产，一点一滴都要献给党的事业。因之，他们最善于保护自己的生命，也最勇于牺牲自己的生命。而这一切都是为了把生命合理地使用到对党和人民的事业最有利益的地方。为党和人民的事业而英勇牺牲的先烈们，都是最懂得生命的宝贵意义的，也是最会合理地使用生命的人。没有他们，革命的胜利和人类的解放都将是不可设想的。
    但是，在我们党内也还有少数人不能把个人利益无条件地服从党的利益。有些人尽管嘴里说着要全心全意为人民服务，但却常常借口保护自己的健康而逃避比较艰苦的工作，或者是马马虎虎工作，唯恐“累坏”了自己。有时有了一点病就要求休养，休养好了还不愿工作，把自己的身体看得比革命工作还可宝贵。有些人要求个人的物质享受，要求名誉地位等。当这些要求不能得到满足的时候，他们就苦恼得心神不安，把许多时间精力浪费在这些私人问题上而毫不吝惜。有些人甚至为此消极堕落随便糟踏自己。这些人是不懂得共产党员生命的真实意义的。他们往往是把自己的生命比党和人民的事业看得更重，而也正就是他们严重地浪费了自己的生命。他们一味只想个人的健康和快乐，而他们却正因此往往堕进颓废烦恼的泥淖。
    一个党员最大的满足和愉快就是为人民为党做好工作。为了创造人民大众的美好的将来，每一个共产党员都不能一时一刻放弃或放松眼前的艰苦的工作任务。每个共产党员都应当很好地向赵桂兰同志学习，更要向党的领袖和先烈们学习，努力作一个好的共产党员。（附图片）
