Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch - The summer harvest has mostly concluded in most parts of the country, with wheat yields generally better than last year. This year, the total wheat planting area nationwide reached 375 million mu, an increase of over 30 million mu compared to last year. Preliminary estimates suggest a national wheat output of approximately 40 billion jin, an increase of approximately 6.6 billion jin compared to last year. Currently, some areas in the Southwest, Central South, and East China are proceeding directly from the end of the summer harvest to completing sowing and rice transplanting. Some areas in North and Northwest China are facing a tense period with the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing intertwined. Spring wheat in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Chahar and Suiyuan in North China is currently forming kernels and heading, and will be ready for harvest in about half a month.

The increased wheat production this year is due not only to abundant rainfall in most areas, but more importantly, to the active implementation of intensive cultivation and continuous struggle against various disasters by farmers under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government and the Communist Party. Last winter, farmers in old liberated areas generally applied base fertilizer to wheat fields. This spring, farmers in most areas also applied top dressing to wheat fields. Areas planting spring wheat generally increased fertilizer application by about 13% compared to last year. In Northeast China, where fertilizer application habits were previously poor, the area of fertilizer application has also generally increased this year, with some areas applying fertilizer to over 90% of cultivated land. Farmers in various regions also paid attention to hoeing wheat this year. Wheat in North China provinces was generally hoed once or twice. Farmers in the Northwest region also changed their past habit of "nine out of ten wheat fields are not hoed" and actively hoed wheat, improving wheat yields. The results of a tenacious struggle against natural disasters also reduced the losses caused by continuous waterlogging, disease, insect pests, hail, and other disasters that occurred in several regions since the beginning of spring. For example, in the Huaiyin Special District of northern Jiangsu, three million mu of wheat fields were flooded in April, but after local farmers actively drained water and protected seedlings under the leadership of the People's Government, approximately 500,000 mu of wheat fields ultimately achieved 50% of a normal harvest. Furthermore, in Hebei Province, 104 counties with over 18.4 million mu of wheat fields suffered from wheat yellow rust disease. After farmers generally performed multiple hoeings to resist the disease, the wheat yield reduction rate was reduced to approximately 10% to 30%. Other disasters, such as wheat midge infestations in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, and hail in Shanxi and the plains, were also mitigated by the efforts of farmers to rescue the crops.

Having learned from the serious damage caused by wheat yellow rust this year, farmers in various regions are focusing on selecting wheat varieties resistant to yellow rust in the wheat seed selection campaign launched during the wheat harvest. In preparation for promoting rust-resistant wheat varieties this autumn, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has entrusted the People's Government of Pingyuan Province to purchase 200,000 jin of rust-resistant "Baitutou" wheat seeds. The People's Governments of Shandong and Henan provinces and the Administrative Offices of northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu are purchasing over 10 million jin of rust-resistant wheat variety "438" in the northern Jiangsu area. Farmers in various regions are also actively signing contracts with neighboring villages to organize exchanges of improved wheat varieties and rust-resistant wheat varieties, actively preparing favorable conditions for increased wheat production next year.

### 全国大部地区夏收已告结束  小麦总产量约达四百亿斤  比去年增产约六十六亿斤

　　全国大部地区夏收已告结束
    小麦总产量约达四百亿斤
    比去年增产约六十六亿斤
    【新华社一日讯】全国大部地区麦收已告结束，小麦收获量一般比去年为好。今年全国小麦种植面积共达三亿七千五百万亩，比去年增加三千多万亩，初步估计全国约产小麦四百亿斤，比去年增加了约六十六亿斤。现西南、中南及华东部分地区已紧接着夏收结束，完成播种插秧，华北及西北的部分地区正面临夏收、夏种、夏锄等工作互相交织的紧张阶段，东北、内蒙及华北的察哈尔、绥远等地春麦正结子吐穗，约半月后即可收割。
    今年小麦的增产，除了广大地区雨水充足的自然原因外，更重要的是各地农民群众在人民政府、共产党的领导和帮助下，积极实行精耕细作和对各种灾害进行了不断斗争。老区农民去冬曾普遍在麦田上增施底粪，大部地区的农民今春又都在麦田上加施追肥，种植春麦的地区一般也较去年增施肥料百分之十三左右。过去麦田施肥习惯较差的东北，今年施肥面积也都普遍增加，今年施肥最多的地区竟达耕地面积百分之九十以上。各地农民今年并注意锄麦。华北各省小麦都普遍锄了一遍至二遍。西北区农民今年也改变了过去“十麦九不锄”的习惯，纷纷锄麦，提高了小麦的产量。与自然灾害顽强斗争的结果，也减轻了入春以来若干地区连续发生的水、病、虫、雹等灾害带来的损失。如苏北淮阴专区四月间曾被水淹没三百万亩麦田，但经当地农民在人民政府领导下积极排水保苗后，终使约有五十余万亩麦田获得五成的年景。又如河北省有一百另四个县一千八百四十余万亩麦田遭受小麦黄锈病害，经过农民群众普遍进行多锄以抵抗病害后，使小麦减产率约降低至百分之十到三十。其他如陕西关中等地的小麦吸浆虫害、山西和平原等地的雹灾，也因农民群众的努力抢救而减轻了它们为害的程度。
    各地农民接受了今年小麦黄锈病严重为害的教训，在麦收时开展的小麦选种运动中，都着重选择能抗黄锈病的麦种。中央人民政府农业部为准备今秋推广抗锈麦种，已委托平原省人民政府收购抗锈病白秃头麦种二十万斤。山东、河南两省人民政府和皖北、苏北两行署在苏北地区收购抗锈麦种四三八号小麦一千余万斤。各地农民群众也正纷纷与邻村订立合同组织互换小麦良种和抗锈麦种，积极为明年小麦的增产准备着有利的条件。
