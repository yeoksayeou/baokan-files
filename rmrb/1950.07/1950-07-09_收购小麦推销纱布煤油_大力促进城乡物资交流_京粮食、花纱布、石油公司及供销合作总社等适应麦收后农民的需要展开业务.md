　　Purchasing Wheat, Promoting Gauze and Kerosene - Vigorously Promoting the Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas
    Beijing Grain, Cotton Cloth, Petroleum Companies, and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Adapt to Farmers' Needs After Wheat Harvest and Expand Business
    [Our Newspaper] In order to stabilize wheat prices and promptly supply the needs of farmers after the wheat harvest, the Beijing Grain Company, Cotton Cloth Company, Petroleum Company, and the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, each within their respective business scope, are purchasing wheat and promoting gauze, cloth, and kerosene in various suburban areas of Beijing through exchange, price purchase, and promotion, vigorously promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.
    The First (Xizhimen), Second (Xiannongtan), and Third (Chaoyangmen) Grain Stations of the Beijing Grain Company, on the first day of starting to purchase wheat and handle the exchange of coarse grains for fine grains on the 4th, received more than 20,000 catties of wheat.
    The Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative also started to purchase wheat in eight districts (East, West, South, North Suburbs, Mentougou, Shijingshan, Changxindian, Fengtai) on July 3rd, with a planned purchase quantity of 2 million catties.
    The Cotton Cloth Branch Company, since late June, has successively transported large quantities of gauze and cloth to the Nanyuan, Tongxian, Dingxian branch companies and Zhuoxian cotton purchasing station, vigorously promoting sales to rural areas. The company also instructed each branch company to take the initiative to combine with local grain companies and cooperatives, and sign gauze and cloth consignment contracts to facilitate sales. In order to facilitate sales and purchases, gauze and cloth can be allocated to grain companies and cooperatives in advance, and payment can be calculated according to the gauze and cloth market price on the day of payment. At the same time, in order to suit and meet the requirements of farmers, each branch company must convene farmer forums, conduct extensive investigations and research, understand the specific requirements of farmers for the color, pattern, quality, and quantity of cloth, and reflect them at any time, so that the company can promptly supply the gauze and cloth needed by farmers.
    The Petroleum Branch Company, in early June, dispatched cadres to the suburbs to investigate the oil needs of farmers, organized cadres to go to the countryside in a planned manner to carry out promotion work in conjunction with cooperatives, so that a large amount of kerosene was supplied to rural areas. Therefore, although June was a traditionally slow month for oil sales, the total monthly sales of kerosene reached 161.79% of the original plan.

　　收购小麦推销纱布煤油  大力促进城乡物资交流
    京粮食、花纱布、石油公司及供销合作总社等适应麦收后农民的需要展开业务
    【本报讯】京市粮食公司、花纱布公司、石油公司及市供销合作总社，为稳定麦价，并及时供应麦收后农民需要，各就其本单位业务范围，分别以交换、价购、推销等方式在京郊各地收购小麦及推销纱、布、煤油，大力促进城乡物资交流。
    京市粮食公司第一（西直门）、二（先农坛）、三（朝阳门）三个粮栈，在四日开始收购小麦和办理以粗换细的交换工作的第一天，共收进了小麦二万余斤。
    京供销合作总社亦于七月三日开始，在八个区（东、西、南、北郊、门头沟、石景山、长辛店、丰台）普遍收购小麦，预定收购的数量为二百万斤。
    花纱布分公司于六月下旬起，陆续运送大批纱布至南苑、通县、定县支公司及涿县收花站，大力向农村推销。该公司并指示各支公司须主动与各地粮食公司及合作社结合，订立代销纱布合同，以利推销。为便于售购，可以先期将纱布拨交粮食公司及合作社，付款时再按当日纱布牌价计算。同时，为适合与满足农民要求，各支公司须召集农民座谈，多方调查研究，了解农民所需布匹颜色、花样、品质、数量等具体情况，随时反映，以便公司及时供应农民所需之纱布。
    石油分公司则于六月初，派遣干部到郊区调查农民需油情况，组织干部有计划的下乡与合作社结合进行推销工作，使大量煤油供应农村。因而六月份虽系销油淡月，但全月共销出煤油达原计划的百分之一百六十一点七九。
