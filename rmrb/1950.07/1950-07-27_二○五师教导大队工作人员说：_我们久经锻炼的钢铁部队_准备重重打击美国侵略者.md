　　Staff of the 205th Division Training Battalion Say:
    Our Steel Troops, Tempered for a Long Time, Are Ready to Heavily Strike the American Aggressors
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the morning of June 28th, the Class B study group of the 205th Division Training Battalion staff were greatly inspired after hearing Premier Zhou's statement regarding Truman's declaration. They immediately convened a current affairs discussion meeting. Everyone unanimously stated: "No matter how Truman uses gangster tactics to threaten us, we have the confidence and strength to liberate Taiwan and defeat American aggression. The territory of the People's Republic of China will never again allow invasion, and world peace will never again allow destruction!"
    Wang Suchun, the Second District Captain of the Third Squad, said: "We used our blood to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, the American running dog, and established the People's Republic of China. We must defend our People's Republic of China. Whoever dares to invade us, we will definitely use all our strength to give them a head-on blow. If American imperialism dares to launch a war, we will definitely make them follow the path of German, Italian, and Japanese fascism." Zhu Wenrui, a medic in the battalion, said: "We are not afraid of threats from American imperialists, nor are we afraid of their gangster tactics. Our determination to liberate Taiwan is unshakable. Whether Truman is a liar or a robber, if he dares to stop us from liberating Taiwan, we will definitely beat him until his head is broken and bleeding!" Zhang Yuebo, the Third District Captain, said: "Our steel troops, tempered for a long time, have a glorious tradition of struggle. Since we can defeat the Chiang bandit gang, we can also defeat American aggression." Cui Chengfang, a barber, said: "American imperialism's aid to Chiang was aimed at turning China into a colony, but they failed. This time, in Korea, they helped Syngman Rhee launch a civil war, but the result is that Syngman Rhee's rule in South Korea, which they have painstakingly supported for years, is about to collapse quickly. American imperialists are like mad dogs, biting here and there. In the past, they even pretended to be good people, but now they are simply openly calling for aggression. We say that this is a sign of a desperate dog jumping over a wall, which not only fails to show its strength but also exposes its ugliness in front of the people of the world." Sergeant Zhang Zigui said: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, this is a matter of course, known to everyone in the world, and even Truman himself admits it. His open act of aggression will definitely encounter strong opposition from peace-loving people around the world and further isolate himself. All of us in the People's Liberation Army must study our skills well, improve our techniques, and become modern national defense forces. We are ready at any time to give the aggressors a resolute blow and support the army in liberating Taiwan." Finally, Administrator Yang of the battalion headquarters said: "The Taiwanese compatriots have been enslaved for decades, and we will never allow the American imperialists to trample on them. In the past, the Chinese ruling class always flattered foreigners, but today the people of New China have stood up and will never allow the Taiwanese compatriots to be oppressed again, nor will they allow Taiwan to be used as a military base to invade our country and disrupt world peace."

　　二○五师教导大队工作人员说：
    我们久经锻炼的钢铁部队
    准备重重打击美国侵略者
    【本报讯】六月二十八日上午，二○五师教导大队工作人员乙级学习班，听到周总理就杜鲁门的声明发表声明后，都非常振奋。马上召开了时事讨论会。大家都一致表示：“无论杜鲁门如何要流氓威胁我们，我们有信心有力量一定要解放台湾，击败美国的侵略行为。中华人民共和国的国土决不再允许侵略，世界持久和平也再不允许破坏！”
    三中队二区队长王素纯说：“我们用鲜血击败了美国走狗蒋介石，建立了中华人民共和国，我们必须来保卫我中华人民共和国。谁敢来侵略我们，我们就一定拿出一切力量来给予当头痛击。美帝国主义要敢发动战争，一定要叫他走德、意、日法西斯的道路。”大队卫生员朱文瑞说：“我们不怕美帝国主义者威胁，不怕它耍流氓手段。我们解放台湾的意志是不可动摇的。杜鲁门是骗子手也罢，是强盗也罢，如果敢来阻止我们解放台湾，一定打他个头破血流！”三区队长张月波说：“我们久经锻炼的钢铁部队，有着光荣的斗争传统。我们既然能打垮蒋匪帮，同样也能打垮美国的侵略。”理发员崔成方说：“美帝援蒋是为了达到把中国变殖民地的目的，结果没有达到。这次在朝鲜帮助李承晚发动内战，但结果却是使数年来费尽心机扶持起来的走狗李承晚在南朝鲜的统治很快就又要垮台。美帝国主义者和疯狗一样，东咬一口，西咬一口，过去还假装好人，这会干脆公开叫喊侵略了。我们说他这是狗急跳墙的表现，不但不能表现其强大，更在世界人民面前暴露了丑态。”上士张子贵说：“台湾是中国的领土，这是天经地义的，世人皆知的，杜鲁门自己也承认的。他这样公开的侵略行为，一定碰到全世界爱好和平人民强烈反对而更加孤立自己。我们全体解放军要好好学习本领，提高技术，成为现代化的国防军。随时准备给侵略者以坚决的打击，支援大军解放台湾。”最后大队部杨管理员说：“台胞被奴役了数十年，决不允许美帝蹂躏了。过去中国统治阶级一贯媚外，今天新中国人民站起来了，就决不允许台胞再受压迫，更不允许台湾作为侵略我国的军事基地来扰乱世界和平。”
