Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st Dispatch from TASS: The entire Soviet people, enthusiastically responding to the call of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace, have begun a large-scale peace signature campaign.

June 30th, Soviet writers, admired and loved by millions of readers, expressed their unshakable will for peace at a signature rally. Ukrainian poet Voronko said: "American bombs have already been dropped on the peaceful homes of the Korean people, but there is no force in the world that can strike down the people's will for peace." Poet Marshak said: "When we sign the peace declaration, we are signing an indictment that will subject the warmongers to a public trial by the people of the world. We are not begging for peace, but fighting for peace. We will surely win." The oldest writer, Konstantin Fedin, took the lead in signing, and hundreds of writers had signed that day.

At a joint meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences held in Moscow, Soviet scientists unanimously expressed their determination to defend peace in every possible way. The scientists attending the meeting have already signed the peace declaration.

Countless workers and technicians in Soviet enterprises held rallies and passed resolutions to unanimously sign the peace declaration. The resolution passed at a mass rally at the Kaliber Factory in Moscow strongly condemned the direct aggression of the American ruling clique in interfering in the internal affairs of Korea and China. These rallies fully demonstrated the strong hatred of the Soviet people, who have worked hard to recover from the wounds of war and are working for a better future for mankind, towards the instigators of new wars. At the same time, it showed the Soviet people's determination to defend peace and their powerful strength. Within a few hours, thousands of workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members had signed the peace declaration.
