　　Teachers and Students in East China and Central South China Study Land Reform Policies During Summer Vacation
    [Our Newspaper News] Teachers and students in schools in East China, Central South, and other regions are actively studying land reform policies during their summer vacation. The Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office has already held a summer education research conference, with participants including education administrative personnel, university, specialized school, and primary and secondary school teachers, and social education workers from various parts of Southern Jiangsu, totaling 5,288 people. The main content of the study is the issue of land reform. In order to provide learning opportunities for teachers who do not participate in the summer education research conference, the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office issued "Instructions for Teachers' Summer Self-Study" in early this month, pointing out that teachers' summer self-study should also be led by the local Education Union and focus on land reform studies, in conjunction with the study of current events and professional work. For example, in Wuxi City, on-the-job teachers staying in Wuxi during the summer vacation have organized a Summer On-the-Job Teachers' Study Committee under the leadership of the Wuxi City Federation of Education Workers and the Education Workers' Union, and have formulated a study plan to promote learning. Young students in various schools are also actively participating in summer studies and various activities. The Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office's Department of Culture and Education, the Southern Jiangsu District Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Southern Jiangsu Student Federation jointly organized the "Southern Jiangsu Youth Summer Camp" in Suzhou to conduct political studies with land reform policies as the basic content.
    In order to strengthen the understanding of the current domestic and international situation among students of major universities and middle schools in Zhejiang Province, and to mobilize a certain number of young students to participate in the land reform movement, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education and the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League held mobilization reports on the 14th of this month by the Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Education, the President of Zhejiang Daily, and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, calling on students to study land reform issues and participate in land reform work. The Hangzhou Municipal Education Bureau also held a training class for primary school teachers during the summer vacation, selecting more than 400 on-the-job teachers from public and private primary schools in the city to participate in the study. The content of the study also centered on land reform, and in conjunction with their own thoughts and actions, launched criticism and self-criticism. In addition, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education also mobilized 500 students to form a land reform work team to prepare to go to the countryside to participate in land reform work, including graduates and dropouts of this semester from public and private high schools, senior vocational schools, and normal schools in Hangzhou, students from the Chinese Language Department and the Rural Economics Department of Zhejiang University, and unemployed primary school teachers.
    The Northern Anhui Administrative Office issued a circular in mid-month, instructing all localities to universally hold summer research conferences for primary and secondary school teachers, with the study of land reform policies as the central task, and stipulating that most of the time should be spent studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session, Vice-Chairman Liu's report on the land reform issue, and the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China." In order to enable future improvements in school teaching and propaganda to play a greater role in promoting land reform work, the Administrative Office's Department of Culture and Education specifically called on cultural and educational departments at all levels to conscientiously and responsibly organize summer teacher research conferences, and planned to strive for more than one-fifth of the primary and secondary school teachers in the region to participate in this study.
    The Departments of Culture and Education, Provincial Committees of the Communist Youth League, and Student Federations of the People's Governments of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces issued notices on student summer activities in early this month, arranging for the study of land reform policies. Jiangxi Province decided to organize unified leadership of student work during the summer vacation in major cities, in coordination with relevant parties, and to hold summer youth academies. In areas where economic conditions permit, training classes for cadres of school youth league branches will be held to study the Land Reform Law and summarize student work experience. Before returning home, students should be given ideological mobilization and short-term land reform education and production policy education to improve their understanding. For some public-funded students staying on campus during the summer vacation, work teams should be organized to go to the countryside to conduct land reform propaganda, assist the government in carrying out the current central work, and help the families of martyrs and soldiers and poor peasants carry out production. Various parts of Hunan Province have adopted forms such as summer youth academies, study groups, or study classes to organize students to participate in the study of land reform policies, and have organized student rural service teams to carry out propaganda of the Land Reform Law and various policies of the People's Government in rural areas.

　　华东中南各地学校师生暑期学习土地改革政策
    【本报讯】华东、中南等地区学校师生，利用暑期，积极学习土地改革政策。苏南行署已举办了暑期教育研究会，参加学习人员包括苏南各地教育行政人员、大学、专门学校及中小学教师、社教工作人员等总计达五千二百八十八人。学习主要内容是研究土改问题，苏南行署为了使不参加暑期教育研究会学习的教师能获得学习机会起见，并于本月上旬发布了“教师暑期自学指示”，指出教师们的暑期自学亦应在当地教联领导下以土改学习为主，并联系研究时事和业务。如无锡市暑期留锡在职教师，在锡市教育工作者联合会和教育工作者工会的领导下，已组织了暑期留锡在职教师学习委员会，订定了学习计划推动学习。各地学校青年学生，亦正积极参加暑期学习及各项活动。苏南行署文教处、青年团苏南区工委、苏南学联，特在苏州市联合举办“苏南青年夏令营”，进行以土改政策为基本内容的政治学习。
    浙江省教育厅暨青年团、杭市工委会为加强各大、中学校同学对目前国内外形势的认识，及发动一定数量青年学生参加土地改革运动起见，于本月十四日由省府教育厅副厅长，浙江日报社长，省府副秘书长在三处分别作了动员报告，号召同学学习土改问题，参加土改工作。杭州市教育局并于暑假期间举办小学教师训练班，抽调该市公私立小学在职教师四百余人参加学习，学习内容亦以土地改革为中心，并联系自己的思想行动，展开批评与自我批评。此外，浙江省府教育厅并动员学生五百名，组织土改工作队，准备下乡参加土改工作，其中包括杭市公私立高中、高级职业学校及师范学校本学期毕业生和肄业学生，浙江大学国文系及农村经济系学生、失业小学教师等。
    皖北行署于本月中旬通令各地普遍举办暑期中小学教师研究会，以学习土改政策为中心任务，并规定用大部分时间学习毛主席在三中全会上的报告、刘副主席关于土地改革问题的报告以及“中华人民共和国土地改革法”。行署文教处为使今后改进学校教学及宣传与推动土改工作能起较大作用起见，特号召各级文教部门认真负责办好暑期教师研究会，并计划争取全区五分之一以上的中小学教师参加此次学习。
    江西、湖南、湖北三省人民政府文教厅、青年团省工委及学联于本月初旬先后发出了关于各地学生暑期活动的通知，布置学习土地改革政策。江西省决定在较大城市，配合各有关方面组织暑期学生工作的统一领导，举办暑期青年学园。在经济条件许可的地区，举办学校青年团支部干部训练班，学习土地改革法和总结学生工作经验。对回乡学生，在离校前要进行思想动员和短期的土改教育与生产政策教育，使其在认识上提高一步。对部分暑期留校的公费生，要组织下乡工作队，进行土改宣传，并协助政府进行当前中心工作，帮助烈、军属及贫苦农民进行生产。湖南省各地已采取暑假青年学园、学习团、或学习班等形式，组织学生参加土地改革政策的学习，并组织了学生农村服务队，在农村中进行土地改革法及人民政府各项政策的宣传。
