Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 23rd: TASS reported on the 23rd that "Izvestia" published an article by Bulgakov, commenting on the International Film Competition currently held in Czechoslovakia, stating: "The International Film Competition is being held at a time when the struggle between the peace camp and the warmongering camp has reached a critical point. It once again demonstrates that the peace camp is stronger than the war camp."

The Korean film "Song of Friendship" and the Chinese film "Daughters of China" received universal admiration and cheers. The authenticity, the purity of thought, and the noble goals set by these authors who are taking their first steps in film have captivated the audience.

The audience also saw the Norwegian film "Street of Urchins," which tells of the plight of a child in a bourgeois city; the French comedy "The Postman," which mocks de Gaulle; and the American film directed by Dmytryk, which depicts the shattered happiness of a bricklayer. They were all well-received. Dmytryk is currently imprisoned in an American prison, and the audience cheered for his work, expressing their respect for him.

During the competition, filmmakers and critics decided to establish an International Federation of Progressive Film Workers. Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, France, the United States, Italy, and other countries expressed their views, unanimously calling on progressive filmmakers around the world to fight for the strengthening of peace.
