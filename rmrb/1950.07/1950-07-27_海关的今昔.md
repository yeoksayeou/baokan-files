　　The Customs Then and Now
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Lin Wei
    The Era of Imperialist Rule
    In the Shanghai Customs (formerly Jianghai Customs) building on the west bank of the Huangpu River on the Bund, several customs staff members recounted to me the historical facts of how imperialism controlled China's customs and carried out economic and even political aggression against China. Some of them had worked in the customs for two or thirty years, and the least had worked for three or four years. They had personal experiences of the old era and clear feelings about the new era.
    During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, China's customs was completely handed over to British imperialists to manage ("Naturally, the United States, France, and other imperialists also had a share"). The door of old China was wide open to imperialism. The tariff rules and rates for import and export goods were bound by unequal treaties, and China could not decide or change them at all. The organization, system, and personnel of the customs were all controlled and dominated by the British Inspector General of Customs. The old Chinese customs under imperialist control, in addition to protecting the dumping of their goods in China with low import tax rates, also provided various import and export conveniences to foreign merchants. The regulation that "consular visas shall be unconditionally executed by the customs" guaranteed all conveniences for foreign merchants. Foreign ships could hand over important documents to the consul instead of to customs officers, and the customs would be notified by the consulate, saying, "All documents are kept at our office, please release them." When disputes occurred between the customs and foreign merchants, they were also handled by the consul. The valuation of foreign merchants' goods was often based on the lowest prices. After paying taxes, if the goods were not sold in China or for other reasons needed to be re-exported, the customs also had a "tax refund" regulation, so that foreign merchants' goods could freely enter and exit without paying taxes. The power of the customs was expanded to directly guarantee and replace the Manchu Qing government in paying indemnities and foreign debts. Before the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the right to dispose of all customs revenue was handed over to the customs; the scope of customs control was extended to the Changguan which collected "likin". The Inspector General of Customs and the Commissioners of Customs at various ports, as well as clerks and secretaries, were all foreigners.
    At that time, the Chinese customs had a special office in London to serve foreign customs personnel returning home for vacation and thugs and ruffians recruited by imperialists to work in the Chinese customs. Survey and statistical materials on the production and market conditions in various parts of China, which China did not even know about, were sent to foreign merchants and foreign governments through the customs office for aggression and plunder.
    During the First Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, the imperialists, fearing the rapid development of Chinese revolutionary forces, and the Chinese customs staff also organized to resist, the mode of rule underwent some changes. For example, the promotion of Chinese staff members was ostensibly no longer restricted, and even Chinese staff members were promoted to be Commissioners of Customs at individual ports; Chinese and foreign staff members held the same positions, and there used to be two salary scales, with a difference of ten to twenty times, which at that time ostensibly became one scale, with the same salary (in reality, various subsidies were still given to foreign staff members, and the difference was still very large). However, the imperialists' ruling power was not weakened, because the highest position of Inspector General of Customs was always held by them. And the power of the Inspector General of Customs extended from deciding tax rules and systems to all personnel changes.
    The Kuomintang's So-called Customs "Autonomy"
    In 1928, the imperialist countries ostensibly recognized China's customs autonomy, and in 1929, the so-called "autonomous" tariff was produced, but it was actually based on the tax rates proposed by the special committee of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan at the Beijing Special Conference in 1925. The 1931 tariff was formulated according to the requirements of Japan and was by no means autonomous. In 1948, the Kuomintang reactionary government, following the will of its American masters, formulated sweeping tax reduction rules. Most of the goods that the United States needed to dump in China had greatly reduced tax rates; at the same time, it deceived the Chinese people by saying that "the United States has made even greater concessions on our export goods." In fact, our export goods were all raw materials needed by the United States, and a large part of the import goods from the United States were not urgently needed by our country, or could be manufactured and produced in large quantities in our country. The Kuomintang reactionaries also ostensibly implemented import and export trade controls, touting the so-called "protection of production," but in fact, the four major families colluded with their American masters to engage in large-scale smuggling. Expensive cars, nylon stockings, plastic raincoats, foreign wines, and various cosmetics were ostensibly "banned"; but as soon as they were said to be "military supplies" or "surplus materials," the customs did not even dare to look at them and let them be unloaded. Soong Tzu-wen's Fuzhong Company and Kung Hsiang-hsi's Yangzi Company were engaged in this kind of smuggling, and no one dared to stop them. On the eve of liberation, the markets in Shanghai and even major cities were full of American goods, just like Japanese goods before the Anti-Japanese War.
    The Beginning of a New Life
    Facing China's new century and the customs' new century, everyone began to overflow with new hope and joy. They said that today's customs has become a real Chinese customs, and today's tariffs have become real autonomous tariffs. We do not allow the import of items that our country does not need today, that are not urgently needed, that we can already manufacture in large quantities, or that we will soon be able to manufacture in large quantities. For the same import goods, we can also levy different tax amounts according to the different relationships between that country and us. The phenomenon of large-scale smuggling has also become rare with the collapse of imperialist and comprador forces. The thorough implementation of the foreign trade control policy has made the customs a real weapon to protect domestic production. The people who control this weapon are no longer the Inspector Generals and Commissioners of Customs appointed by the United Kingdom or the United States, but the Directors and Commissioners of Customs appointed by the Chinese people. The consular visa system is gone, the privileges of foreign merchants are gone, and the customs can handle affairs according to its own regulations. We no longer give them tax refunds when foreign goods are re-exported after entering the country, but instead give them various restrictions. The promotion and demotion of customs cadres are no longer based on the love and hatred of imperialists and the comprador class, but on the size and sincerity of their service to the people. Now many capable Chinese staff members who were buried in the past have been promoted to important positions that they never dreamed of, and they are doing very well. The treatment of foreign and Chinese staff members is truly no different.
    Luo Hanxha, the chief of the secretariat section, said: The current treatment is slightly lower than some of the periods with the highest treatment in the past because of the country's financial difficulties, and the work and study are much more intense than in the past. A very small number of backward elements who could not resist the temptation of money and corrupt life and made some money before liberation voluntarily resigned. However, the vast majority of customs staff members are willing to transform themselves and serve the people. After the education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, everyone is generally able to think from a big picture. Personal plans cannot be said to have been completely abandoned, but they are being rapidly diluted.
    Chen Enxian, the chief of the Lujiazui Port Police Branch, is an elderly person who is very serious and down-to-earth in his work. He said: "I was ready to hand over the work when I was first liberated. I believed in the old saying that 'a new emperor has new courtiers.' Now, after more than a year of personal experience, I understand: as long as you serve the people wholeheartedly, you will definitely have a future. The Communist Party is completely different from the rulers of the past." Recalling the long years in the past, he examined his own thoughts: "In the past, I also worked hard, but I didn't know why I was working. I did what people told me to do, and it was just a routine job every day. Now my work has a far-reaching goal: to serve the people." In this way, there are many things that he did not need to do himself in the past, but now he does them himself whenever he has time. Sometimes he braves the rain to the river to handle incidents.
    The long-standing disunity and non-cooperation between the port police and the crew members have been eliminated, and now friendly mutual assistance is being implemented in all aspects. The "scalpers" who extorted passengers and cargo owners in the port and on the dock have been basically eliminated by them. They have begun to treat passengers and boatmen with a kind attitude, so that navigation and other order are maintained quite well. Delays or sleeping during night shifts have been greatly reduced. The work of burning coal and loading and unloading on the ship used to be impossible without hiring people; now, in order to save expenses, they automatically start doing it themselves.
    Within the customs, a large-scale study movement and anti-corruption movement have been launched. Many people have, for the first time in their lives, reported themselves and are determined to "start life anew." They want to transform themselves "from slaves of money to masters of the country." Many people who used to hold blind "big customs"ism, "golden rice bowl" thinking, or blindly worshipped the United Kingdom and the United States have now begun to consciously conduct self-examination and criticism. Everyone is studying various ways to improve the work of the customs, so as to reduce trouble for cargo owners and passengers, and to enable domestic production to be better protected. This situation has never existed before liberation.

### 海关的今昔

　　海关的今昔
    本报特派记者  林韦
    帝国主义统治的时代
    在外滩黄浦江西岸的上海海关（原名江海关）大楼里，几个海关工作人员对我叙述了过去帝国主义把持中国海关，对中国实行经济以至政治侵略的史实。他们有的在海关工作了二、三十年，最少的也工作了三、四年。对旧的时代有着亲身的体验，对新的时代也有鲜明的感觉。
    满清统治时期，中国的海关是完全交给英帝国主义者来办的“自然美、法等帝国主义也都有份）。旧中国的大门对帝国主义畅开着。进出口货物的税则、税率，受着不平等条约的束缚，自己完全不能决定，也不能变更一分一厘。海关的组织、制度、人事，全由英国籍的总税务司操纵支配。帝国主义把持下的旧中国海关，除以低进口税率保护他们的货物倾销中国外，并以各种进出口的方便给予了外商。“领事签证，海关无条件执行”的规定，就保证了外商的一切便利。外籍轮船可以把重要证件交给领事而不交给海关人员，仅由领事馆通知海关，说“证件均留我处，即请放行。”海关和外商发生纠纷时，也要由领事来处理。外商的货物估价，经常依照最低的价格。交了税以后，如果在中国没有卖掉，或有其他原因，需要重新出口时，海关并有“退还税款”的规定，使外商的货物可以不纳税捐自由出入。海关的权力，扩大到可以直接担保并代替满清政府支付赔款和外债。满清被推翻以前，并将全部关税收入的支配权全部交给海关；海关的控制范围扩展到征收“厘金”的常关。海关的总税务司、各口岸税务司，以至帮办、书记之类的职员，全由外人担任。
    那时候，中国海关在伦敦设有专门的办事处来伺候归国度假期的外籍海关人员和帝国主义招收来中国海关工作的流氓无赖。帝国主义对于中国各地的出产与市场情况的调查统计材料，中国还不知道，就经过海关的办事处发给了外商与外国政府，以供侵略掠夺之用。
    一九二五到一九二七年第一次大革命时期，帝国主义慑于中国革命势力迅速发展，海关华员也有组织地起来反抗，统治的方式有了若干改变。比如，华员职位的提升表面上没有了限制，甚至提升华员来当个别口岸的税务司；华员与洋员担任同样的职务，以前有两种待遇表，相差十倍至二十倍，当时表面上成了一张表，一样待遇（实际仍以各种津贴给与洋员，相差仍极悬殊）。但是帝国主义的统治权并未削弱，因为总税务司的最高职位始终掌握在他们手里。而总税务司的权力是从决定税则、制度，一直达到所有人事更动的。
    国民党的所谓关税“自主”
    一九二八年，各帝国主义国家表面上承认了中国关税自主，并于一九二九年产生了所谓“自主”税则，实际上却是按一九二五年北京特别会议上英美日专门委员会提出的税率订定的。一九三一年的税则，则是根据日本的要求制定，均无自主可言。一九四八年，国民党反动政府更遵循着美国主子的意志，制定了大刀阔斧的减让税则。美国需要在中国倾销的大部货品，税率都大大减低；同时又以“美国对我国出口货品减让更大”来欺骗中国人民。而实际上，我国的出口货都是美国所需要的原料，美国来的入口货则有很大部分是并非我国所急需、或是我国亦能大量制造和出产的。国民党反动派表面上也实施进出口贸易管制，标榜着所谓“保护生产”，实际却是四大家族勾结其美国主子大量走私。高贵的小汽车、玻璃丝袜、玻璃雨衣、洋酒以至各种各色的化装品，表面上是“禁运”的；但一说是“军用品”，“剩余物资”，海关连看都不敢看就放进来卸货。宋子文的孚中公司，孔祥熙的扬子公司就干着这种走私买卖，谁也不敢挡驾。解放前夕，上海以至各大城市的市场上美货充斥，正像抗日前夕的日货一样。
    新生的开始
    面对着目前中国的新世纪与海关的新世纪，大家开始洋溢着新的希望与喜悦。他们说，今天的海关成了真正的中国海关，今天的关税成了真正的自主关税。凡是我国今天用不着的、不急需的，自己已能大量制造或即将能够大量制造的物品，我们都不准许入口。同是入口货物，我们也能依照该国和我们关系的不同，而课以不同的税额了。大规模走私的现象，也随着帝国主义与买办势力的垮台而很少见了。对外贸易管制政策的彻底实施，使海关真正成为保护国内生产的武器。掌握这一武器的不再是由英国或美国人担任的总税务司、税务司之流，而是由中国人民担任的署长、关长了。领事签证制没有了，外商的特权没有了，海关可以依照自己的关章办事了。外货入口后重新出口，我们不再给他们退税，而要反转来予以各种限制了。海关干部的升降，不再是根据帝国主义与买办阶级的憎爱，而要根据对人民服务的成绩大小、诚意如何了。现在有不少过去曾被埋没了的精明强干的华员，被提升到他们自己从来没有梦想到的重要职位，而且干得很好。洋员与华员的待遇，真正没有了区别。
    秘书科长罗汉槎说：现在的待遇，因为国家财经困难，和过去待遇最高的某些时期比起来是稍低一点，工作学习则比过去紧张得多。有极少数经不住金钱与腐化生活诱惑的、解放以前发了点财的落后分子，自动辞职了。但海关的绝大多数工作人员则都愿意改造自己，为人民服务。经过共产党与人民政府的教育，大家一般已能从大处着想。个人的打算不能说已经完全丢弃，但是在迅速地被冲淡着。
    陆家咀港警分署署长陈恩贤，是一个工作十分认真踏实的老年人。他说：“我在初解放时是准备好了要办交代的。我相信着‘一朝天子一朝臣’的老道理。现在经过一年多的亲身体验，我看明白了：只要全心全意为人民服务，就一定有前途。共产党和过去的统治者完全不一样。”回忆着过去悠长的岁月，他检讨自己的思想：“以前也是辛辛苦苦工作，但是不知道为什么工作，人家叫做什么就做什么，每天是照例公事。现在我的工作有了远大的目标：为人民服务。”这样，有许多从前用不着他亲自动手的事，现在只要有空，他就亲自动手。有时是冒着雨到江面上处理事件。
    港警与船员之间历史悠久的不团结、不合作现象消除了，现在开始从各方面实行友谊的互助。港内与码头上敲诈旅客货主的“黄牛”党，基本上被他们肃清了。他们开始用和蔼的态度去对待旅客与船户，使航行与其他秩序维持得相当好。夜间出班时的拖延或睡觉情事大大减少。船上的烧煤、装卸工作，以前非雇人不可；现在他们为了节约开支，都自动下手来做。
    海关内部，发动了大规模的学习运动与反贪污运动。许多人生平第一次地自己检举自己，决心“重新开始做人”。要把自己“从金钱的奴隶变成国家的主人”。有许多人过去抱着盲目的“大海关”主义、“金饭碗”思想或盲目崇拜英美，现在开始自觉地进行检讨，批判。大家研究着各种各样的办法来改进海关的工作，使货主旅客减少麻烦，使国内生产能得到更好的保护。这种情况在解放之前是从来没有过的。
