　　Beijing Municipality Implements Illiteracy Elimination
    Decides to Use the Third District as a Trial Area to Gain Experience
    Large-Scale Illiteracy Elimination Campaign to be Launched Next Year
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government held a "Literacy Campaign Symposium" in the Municipal Government on the 13th. In order to carry out a large-scale "literacy campaign" next year, the Municipal People's Government decided to select a district in the second half of this year to pilot the literacy campaign, create experience, and therefore specially convened a symposium to widely solicit opinions in order to formulate a pilot literacy campaign plan. The meeting was attended by the Central People's Government's Cultural and Educational Commission, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Cultural and Educational Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Education Workers' Union, the Amateur Education Working Committee, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Education Department of Normal University, and the Education Department of Fu Jen Catholic University, a total of twenty-three units. Vice Mayor Wu Han chaired the meeting, explaining the significance of the meeting and the importance of eliminating illiteracy. Xue Chengye, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education, reported on the preparations for the illiteracy elimination survey. Subsequently, Lu Zhiwei and Lin Handa of Yenching University, Dong Weichuan of Normal University, Tang Lan and Luo Changpei of Peking University, Peng Qingzhao of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and more than ten others spoke successively, providing many opinions on the principles, steps, organization, leadership, teaching materials, teaching methods, and how to conduct the survey for the illiteracy elimination work. They unanimously expressed their willingness to assist in the implementation of this work.
    This work is still a first-time experiment in Beijing, and it is planned to select the Third District as the pilot area for illiteracy elimination. After gaining experience, it will be promoted to the whole city. The Third District is the most populous district in the city, with thirteen state-owned factories and more than one hundred private small factories. The residents are mostly working people; and because there are two universities, more than eighty middle schools, primary schools, and vocational schools, and two cultural centers in the district, the social education forces are relatively strong, which is a favorable condition for carrying out the work. Therefore, the district is taken as the key pilot area. First, a cultural survey committee will be formed by the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Federation of Students, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Education Workers' Union, and the Public Security Bureau, a total of eight units, to mobilize university and middle school students and teachers to participate in the survey work during the summer vacation.

　　京市试行扫除文盲
    决定以第三区为试验区吸取经验 
    明年将展开大规模扫除文盲运动
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府于十三日在市政府内召开“扫除文盲座谈会”。市人民政府为了明年开展大规模的“扫除文盲运动”，决定在今年下半年选择一个区试行扫除文盲工作，创造经验，因此特召开座谈会，广泛征求意见，以便制定试验扫除文盲计划。出席座谈会的有中央人民政府文化教育委员会、教育部、文化部，中国科学院语言研究所，全国总工会文教部，市总工会文教部，市文教局，教育工作者工会，业余教育工作委员会，团市工委，师范大学教育系、辅仁大学教育系等二十三个单位。会议由吴晗副市长主席，他说明了开会的意义和扫除文盲的重要性。文教局薛成业副局长报告扫除文盲调查工作准备情况。接着燕京大学陆志韦、林汉达，师范大学董渭川，北京大学唐兰、罗常培，全国总工会彭庆昭等十余人相继发言，对扫除文盲工作的方针、步骤、组织、领导、教材、教学法及如何进行调查等问题提供了许多意见。并一致表示愿意协助这个工作的推行。
    这个工作在北京市还是初次试验，打算选择第三区为扫除文盲试验区。俟吸取经验后，再推广到全市。第三区是全市人口最多的一个区，区内有公营工厂十三处，私营小厂百余处，居民中以劳动人民较多；又因该区有大学两处，中、小学及职业学校八十余处，文化馆两处，社会教育力量较强，是开展工作的有利条件，故以该区为重点试验区。先由市文教局、中共北京市委宣传部、市总工会文教部、团市工委、市学联、市妇联、教育工作者工会及公安局等八个单位组成文化调查委员会，于暑假期间动员大、中学生及教员参加，进行调查工作。
