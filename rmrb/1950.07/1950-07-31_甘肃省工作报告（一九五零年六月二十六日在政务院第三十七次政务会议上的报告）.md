Report on the Work of Gansu Province
(Report to the 37th Meeting of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on June 26, 1950)
Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the People's Government of Gansu Province

Premier, Vice-Premiers, Members, Comrades:

I, on behalf of the People's Government of Gansu Province, report to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on several major tasks of the past five months.

	I. Suppression of Bandits and Elimination of Special Agents

By February of this year, bandit gangs throughout the province had been largely eliminated. From September of last year to February of this year, a total of 16,600 bandits were killed, wounded, captured, or surrendered, including 34 notorious bandit leaders such as Ma Shaowu. A total of 35 artillery pieces of various types and 11,281 firearms of various types were seized. The remaining bandits, hiding in the remote mountainous areas, number approximately 5,200 and are being continuously suppressed. In terms of eliminating special agents, 689 important special agents were placed under supervision and training, and 343 special agents who were lying dormant or continuing their activities were arrested and detained.

Currently, the remaining bandits and special agents are still continuing their activities, attempting to provoke discord between ethnic groups, especially creating disputes between the Hui and Han people. In April and May of this year, enemy special agents colluded with bandits, reactionary secret societies (Yiguandao, Wujidao, Big Sword Society, Red Spear Society, etc.), remnants of the Ma bandits, reactionary military officers, and local bullies, coercing the masses and plotting armed jailbreaks in counties such as Qingshui and Huichuan, and organizing armed disturbances in areas such as Lanzhou, Gaolan, Pingliang, Tianshui, Guyuan, Linxia, and Wuwei. Due to the assistance of the local masses, these plots were successively uncovered by us. Bandits and special agents also spread rumors, fired shots, set fires, poisoned, and assassinated working cadres in various places. According to materials obtained by the public security departments, all of these sabotage activities were instigated behind the scenes by the American imperialist running dog, Chiang Kai-shek.

Our guiding principle for suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents is basically "military suppression as the main focus, political disintegration as the auxiliary"; however, for mass disturbances in areas where ethnic groups live together or in mixed communities, appropriate handling is based on the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program. To thoroughly eliminate the activities of bandits and special agents, we must further connect with the masses, rely on the masses, overcome complacency and a sense of peace among cadres, and raise vigilance. We must strictly prohibit random beatings and arrests, and widely expose the deceptive propaganda of bandits, special agents, and reactionary secret societies, so that they are isolated from the masses.

II. Production and Disaster Relief, Spring Plowing, and Opium Prohibition

A. Production and Disaster Relief The main disaster suffered by this province is banditry, with the Linxia District being the most severely affected, with approximately 400,000 people affected, of whom 50,000 have no food or clothing. Losses include 350,000 piculs of grain, as well as houses, livestock, and other property, with a total value of over 8 billion yuan. In the Jiuquan District, bandits stole over 10,000 head of livestock, and 30% of the people in the entire district have no food. In addition, many areas have suffered from disasters such as wind, hail, rain, frost, water, insects, and rodents. According to incomplete statistics from the Linxia, Qingyang, and Pingliang districts, 22,600 households and 93,000 people in 16 districts and 51 townships have been affected, with a disaster-stricken cultivated area of over 2,289,000 mu. In the pastoral area of Ejin Banner, half of the livestock starved to death due to flooding of the grassland.

In the work of production and disaster relief, we emphasized the slogan "self-reliance in production as the main focus, mutual assistance and government relief as supplementary." We focused our work on the Linxia District, which was the most severely affected by banditry, first organizing a Hui-Han People's Unity Committee to publicize and explain ethnic policies and mobilize disaster victims to return to their villages. Villages established mutual assistance agreements to help disaster victims find housing, borrow grain, and generally organize labor exchange to solve the problem of livestock power for disaster victims. Now, the vast majority of disaster victims have returned to their villages and are engaged in production.

Farmers in various places also organized handicrafts and sideline production such as transportation, weaving, salt boiling, firewood carrying, fertilizer accumulation, and medicinal herb digging, according to their specific circumstances and using all possible conditions. For example, over 50% of farmers in Tongwei County used sideline production to solve the problem of lacking food and seeds.

The Provincial People's Government distributed a relief fund of 100 million yuan and 1,000 piculs of relief grain in the Linxia District. The 30,000 piculs of relief grain allocated to Gansu by the Central People's Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee have also been distributed. In addition, troops, government agencies, organizations, and people from all over the province launched disaster relief movements, raising grain, cash, and clothing to help disaster victims.

With the joint efforts of the government and the people, Gansu Province has basically overcome the disaster. However, many shortcomings have also occurred in the work. For example, investigation and research work was not done enough, and we could not understand the disaster situation well. The leading cadres in the Linxia District did not closely integrate the implementation of ethnic policies with disaster relief work, and put forward the slogan "unity first, relief second," so that relief grain could not be distributed in a timely manner.

B. Spring Plowing In conjunction with production and disaster relief, the Provincial People's Government called on all parts of the province to actively arrange spring plowing work. Localities held cadre meetings to formulate work plans, discuss and solve the difficult problems in spring plowing, promptly organize work teams to go to the countryside to supervise and help the spring plowing work, and through the people's representatives conferences and farmers' congresses at all levels, focused on discussing the spring plowing production issues this year, and set out specific measures. What should be especially pointed out here is that the Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference held in March this year played a decisive role in the spring plowing work in Gansu this year. According to reports from various places: After returning to their hometowns, the representatives generally took the lead in actively producing, and widely publicized various policies, eliminating the concerns of farmers and stimulating production enthusiasm. At the same time, the end of the war, the elimination of large-scale bandits, rural stability, the exemption of war service burdens, and the increase of labor and livestock have also created favorable conditions for this year's spring plowing work. The peasant masses of Zhangye County said: "This year, we will neither escape military service nor evade public grain, what else can we do if we don't engage in production?" According to the farmers in Huaping County: "The enthusiasm has not been this high for ten years."

In order to solve the difficulties in spring plowing, the province's 60,000 piculs of millet for agricultural production loans began to be issued in early March. And the rural free lending that had once stagnated after liberation has become active again due to the publicity and promotion of farmer representatives and cadres at all levels. By mid-May, according to incomplete statistics: in ten districts, fifty-two counties and Lanzhou City, the total amount of grain lent out through free lending is estimated to be about 150,000 piculs. Taking the statistics of six counties in Dingxi District as an example: mutual lending of grain was 12,990 piculs, government loans were 2,490 piculs, cleaning up of charity warehouses and old interest-free grain was 660 piculs, the fruits of the anti-hegemony struggle were 1,755 piculs, totaling 17,995 piculs, all of which were used for production, solving the difficulties of more than 16,000 households. The six counties have a total of 3 million mu of cultivated land, which has all been sown.

Various types of labor exchange groups were also generally organized in various places during the spring plowing. According to incomplete statistics from eight districts, twenty-two counties and Lanzhou City: there were a total of 3,481 labor exchange groups, including 17,286 laborers and 2,187 head of livestock. A considerable number of women participated in the labor exchange groups in various places.

Farmers in various places, with the assistance of the government, actively repaired the existing small-scale water conservancy and waterwheels. A total of 184 kilometers of channels were repaired and newly opened in nine counties including Gaolan and Lanzhou City, 68 waterwheels were repaired, and 15 wells were dug, which can irrigate more than 100,000 mu in total.

According to reports from seven districts including Jiuquan, Pingliang, Qingyang, and five counties including Lanzhou City and Gaolan, the spring plowing and sowing in various parts of the province have been basically completed. Even in the Linxia District, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, most of the cultivated land has been sown after mobilizing disaster victims to return to their villages to rush to plant. In addition, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-one counties including Gaolan: 1,739 mu of reclaimed wasteland have been opened and all sown; 80,108 mu of unreclaimed wasteland have been partially sown. As for cotton fields, this province originally planned to increase the planting of 10,000 mu this year. According to reports: only eleven counties including Gaolan and Lanzhou City have increased the planting of more than 36,000 mu of cotton fields, more than three and a half times the original plan. The agricultural agency also organized a cotton field prevention and control work team to prevent and control 5,000 mu of cotton fields in Tianshui Jingyuan, which is estimated to increase the production of 50,000 jin of lint. However, this spring, rainfall in various parts of the province, except for Longdong and Longnan, was generally insufficient. As of the end of May, drought has formed in some areas such as Lanzhou City and Dingxi District. In addition, some places have suffered from frost, wind, hail, and insect pests, which have all affected this year's production.

C. Opium Prohibition Before the spring plowing, opium seedlings planted by farmers who were deceived by bandits and special agents were found in some areas of this province. According to incomplete statistics from four districts and eleven counties including Dingxi, the total reached more than 66,000 mu. After governments at all levels publicized opium prohibition in people's representatives conferences, farmers' congresses and mass meetings, and organized work teams to go to the countryside to carry out opium prohibition work, by early May, Gaolan County and Linxia District, which planted the most opium, had roughly cleared it. Other opium seedlings in districts such as Min County, Wuwei, Tianshui, Wudu, and Jiuquan, except for remote mountain areas, have also been cleared in most areas. In the work, cadres in various places can generally grasp the policy, first conduct publicity and explanation to the masses, and start to clear opium seedlings and replant crops on the basis of the masses' awareness. For areas where ethnic groups live together or in mixed communities, prudent steps are taken to avoid causing ethnic disputes as much as possible. However, in Xiahe and Zhuoni in the Tibetan area, because the area is too vast, the conditions for cadres are not enough, and some Tibetans have been planting opium for many years; and in Nanping District on the border between Sichuan and Gansu, which has always been a place where opium dealers come and go, and the market uses opium as currency, our strength has not yet penetrated deeply, and the progress of opium prohibition work is more difficult.

III. Implementation of Ethnic Policies

The ethnic oppression policies long implemented by the reactionary government in Gansu have caused the evil consequences of discrimination and estrangement between ethnic groups. After liberation, due to the instigation of bandits and special agents, ethnic disputes were on the verge of breaking out. The objective reasons for the disturbances in Linxia last year were mainly here. However, the leading cadres in the district made simple, impatient, and empiricist mistakes, did not pay attention to the historical and complex nature of ethnic issues, and did not adhere to the policy of ethnic equality and ethnic unity, which gave bandits and special agents an opportunity to take advantage of it. This is a subjective reason that should not exist. The CCP and the government accepted the lessons of the Linxia incident and carried out rectification work in the district. Stopped collecting civilian guns. Conscientiously rectify and train militiamen. Call on the Hui and Han people to strengthen unity and "help each other, respect each other, not discriminate against each other, and not retaliate against each other" on an equal basis. Mobilize disaster victims to return to their villages. Based on the "political struggle as the main focus" for bandit suppression, the Hui and Han people organized a bandit suppression committee to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to carry out bandit suppression work. Establish consultation committees of representatives of all ethnic groups in the district, and ethnic affairs committees in counties and districts. Convene people's representatives conferences and people's forums of all ethnic groups, Hui-Han Unity Committee, and Hui-Han People's Unity Association. Formulate the Hui-Han Mutual Aid Convention. Up to now, all the bandits in the district have been eliminated, and social order has been basically stabilized. The vast majority of disaster victims have returned to their villages, and the Hui and Han people have helped each other and jointly launched production, disaster relief, and spring plowing work. In addition, the district trained a total of 250 Hui and Tibetan cadres by the end of March, and promoted a group of Hui cadres to serve as deputy commissioners, mayors, county heads, and county-level section chiefs.

After the Linxia incident, the ethnic work in this province has deepened a step further, the awareness of the people of all ethnic groups has generally improved, and the unity between ethnic groups is becoming more and more consolidated. In April and May of this year, bandits and special agents attempted to provoke ethnic unrest in Pingliang and other places, but the vast majority of the people have recognized the conspiracy of bandits and special agents and were not deceived. With the efforts of the government and the people, the situation was quickly brought under control.

In May of this year, the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee was officially established, and the first committee meeting was held at the same time. The committee members are all reputable people from all ethnic groups, who put forward many valuable opinions on the ethnic work in the province, and decided to go to the ethnic gatherings and mixed residence areas after the meeting to carry out condolences, publicize ethnic policies, and strengthen ethnic unity.

As for the Tibetan areas of Xiahe and Zhuoni, regional autonomy has been implemented and is directly led by the Provincial People's Government.

For example, economic trade, culture and education, health, animal husbandry and veterinary work in ethnic minority areas have also been gradually developed.

In short, in Gansu, implementing ethnic policies is the most important and arduous task, and it is the key to all work. Ethnic policies must be implemented in every specific work. First of all, we must do everything possible to eliminate discrimination and estrangement between ethnic groups and realize ethnic equality and unity and mutual assistance. In ethnic gathering areas, regional autonomy is implemented. Respect the customs and habits and religious beliefs of ethnic minorities. Cultivate and promote a large number of cadres from ethnic minorities. In all aspects, try to take care of the people of ethnic minorities as much as possible. Strengthen the ethnic policy education of cadres, resolutely oppose the ideology of great nationalism, and correct the shortcomings in the work.

IV. Carrying out Rural Democratic Reform

This province is generally implementing rent reduction in the new rural areas this year. After the autumn harvest, land reform will be carried out in some areas where conditions are ripe, and various preparations are now underway. This year's land reform is only partial, mainly focusing on pilot projects, drawing experience, training cadres, and creating conditions for large-scale land reform in the coming years. In other areas, continue to suppress bandits and eliminate special agents, oppose hegemony and reduce rent, organize peasants, and weaken feudal forces. As for areas where ethnic groups live together or in mixed communities, more prudent steps need to be taken. At present, we must first concentrate our efforts to promote the unity of the people of all ethnic groups. How to carry out democratic reforms in the future should be decided according to the awareness, needs and other conditions of the people of all ethnic minorities.

Regarding the issue of clearing debts, this province stipulates that all old debts before liberation shall be handled in accordance with the Rent Reduction and Debt Clearing Regulations issued by the Northwest Military and Political Committee. Free lending in rural areas after liberation must be repaid, and the government protects creditors' rights.

V. Unifying Financial and Economic Work

Since the State Council issued instructions on the decision to unify the country's financial and economic work in March of this year, the Northwest Administrative Region convened the Northwest Financial Conference, and this province also convened the Provincial Financial Conference in April. A comprehensive review of past work was conducted, pointing out achievements and shortcomings, and new arrangements were made for future work. Based on the instructions of the Central People's Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, a new budget for the province in 1950 was formulated after careful calculation on the basis of increased income and reduced expenditure. If this budget can be effectively implemented, it will not only reduce the province's fiscal deficit of 72.45% and the grain deficit of 61% in this year's old budget, but also may have some surplus. This is an unprecedented achievement in the province's finance.

Comparison of the old and new budgets: In the past, when formulating the old budget, it was rough and careless, and the personnel and horses were not accurately verified. Due to the idea of ​​reviving everything, it caused huge expenditures on public undertakings. In terms of public undertakings, it accounted for 31.9% of the total budget at that time, of which transportation accounted for 54%, enterprise expenditure accounted for 37%, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy accounted for 3.7%, and salt affairs expenditure accounted for 5.3%. In the new budget, income has increased, with tax revenue alone increasing by 28.74%, plus public debt, enterprise profits, and depreciation, the total can increase by 43.58%. At the same time, in terms of expenditure, because various public undertakings expenditures have been drastically reduced, for example, postal expenditures have been completely cancelled. After reorganizing the institutions, verifying the number of people, and reducing the number of staff by 23.2%, the vacancies were eliminated. In addition, this year's clothing is planned and issued by the Northwest Administrative Region, saving the province a large expenditure. In this way, the expenditure of the new budget is reduced by 73.31% compared with the old budget, completely eliminating the original fiscal deficit.

As for grain, due to the streamlining and verification of personnel and horses, the grain demand for ten months in the old budget was reduced by 21.39%. In addition, all staff in the province saved one tael of rations per person per day, and each livestock saved one jin of feed per day, and wheat should be released for three months, basically eliminating the grain deficit.

The above situation has changed the past face of Gansu's finance. Of course, this requires us to continue to work hard to strive for the full realization of the new budget. By the end of May this year, in terms of income, various taxes in the winter of last year had completed about 80%, and the tax revenue in the first quarter of this year has already been collected. Among them, salt tax has completed 73% by April. All outstanding debts are being urged to be paid. The public grain entering the warehouse has completed more than 80%, and the outstanding debts, except for Linxia, Wudu, and Hui County, which cannot be completed as scheduled due to bandit disasters, the rest can be entered into the warehouse recently. The summer levy has begun to be arranged. The original quota of the first phase of public bonds was 807,126 shares, and 774,797 shares have been paid into the treasury, completing 96%. Among them, Lanzhou City overfulfilled the quota. Due to the imperfection of financial institutions, systems, and cadres, tax evasion and tax evasion reached more than one-third. The custody work of public grain is not done well enough, and the grain in many warehouses has deteriorated, for example, more than 210,000 jin of grain in six counties in Guangyang District have deteriorated. In some areas, the promotion of public bonds has the tendency of compulsory orders and average apportionment. In terms of saving expenditure, the province's reorganization work is underway. Provincial-level agencies have been completed. The two districts of Min County and Zhangye have been abolished. The clearing of finances, enterprises, and small public affairs of various agencies has begun. In the allocation of public undertakings, priorities are given to the most important and urgent matters. In terms of unified revenue and expenditure management, financial institutions have been established in 63 of the 72 counties in the province. Treasuries and grain depots have also begun to be established. Eliminating maneuvering and strictly implementing the financial system stipulated by the central government.

Since March, Gansu's finance and commodity prices have been relatively stable. According to statistics from the Gansu Branch of the People's Bank of China: Lanzhou City's deposits in March were 6.3 billion, and increased to 30.2 billion in April, an increase of 500%, and the number of depositors increased by 60% compared with March. In April, the currency withdrawal accounted for 40% of the total circulation in the province. As for commodity prices, the average price in Lanzhou City fell by 15.9% in March and 44.2% in April. This proves that the unified financial and economic work has achieved remarkable achievements, which is beneficial to the vast majority of the people. As for the current economic downturn of some industrial and commercial enterprises, it is mainly due to the weak purchasing power of rural areas and the low prices of agricultural products. At the same time, industrial products from outside the province are difficult to sell due to inconvenient transportation and high freight costs. The province's enterprises are suffering from poor equipment and management, backward technology, high costs, or blind production, which cannot face the rural areas and form a backlog of sales. This situation exists in both public and private enterprises, and efforts are being made to adjust and improve it. However, a thorough turnaround must be achieved after the land reform is completed.

VI. People's Representatives Conference

By the end of May, all counties and cities in the province had convened more than one People's Representatives Conference. According to statistics: 31 counties have held it twice, and 41 counties have held it once. Cities with a population of more than 30,000: Lanzhou and Tianshui have held it three times, Pingliang and Wuwei twice, and Linxia and Jiuquan once. The way representatives are produced is through a combination of election and invitation. In the county people's representatives conference, farmers' representatives account for an average of 50%, and in the Lanzhou City people's representatives conference, workers' representatives account for 22%. In areas where ethnic groups live together, representatives of ethnic minorities account for a considerable number. Democratic people and enlightened gentry also participate as representatives.

Except for Linxia, all counties have held more than one farmers' congress. Pingliang and Dingxi have held it more than twice. Of the 485 districts in the province, 70% have held farmers' congresses. Of the 3,680 townships, 57% have held farmers' congresses. In March of this year, a provincial farmers' representatives conference was convened, with more than 600 representatives attending, and in May, a provincial workers' representatives conference was convened.

The people's representatives conferences and farmers' congresses in various counties mostly discussed issues such as suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents, opposing hegemony, collecting grain, building political power, production and disaster relief, spring plowing, rent reduction and debt clearing, and organizing peasant associations. The urban people's representatives conferences focused on discussing issues such as restoring and developing industrial production, adjusting labor-capital relations, developing urban and rural trade, and rectifying tax revenue. In areas where ethnic groups live together or in mixed communities, the focus is on discussing ethnic unity and mutual assistance, and improving the economic and cultural life of ethnic minorities.

The Provincial Farmers' Representatives Conference adopted the tasks of rural work in Gansu in 1950, the articles of association of the peasant association, discussed production and disaster relief, spring plowing, rent reduction and debt clearing, and land reform, and elected the provincial peasant association committee. The Provincial Workers' Representatives Conference adopted the tasks of trade union work in 1950 and elected the provincial trade union committee. Among the farmers' congresses, the provincial farmers' representatives conference was the most successful, especially in playing a decisive role in this year's spring plowing production. Among the people's representatives conferences, the second people's representatives conference in Tongwei County was the best. Generally speaking, the second people's representatives conference and farmers' congresses in various places are more progressive and effective than the first. It is planned to convene a provincial people's representatives conference in the second half of the year, and preparations have begun.

What needs to be improved in the work is:

(1) When electing or inviting representatives, we should more widely unite the representatives of various democratic strata to participate, increase the number of representatives of ethnic minorities, so as to expand the people's democratic united front of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society.

(2) Sufficient preparation should be made. The topics should meet the urgent requirements of the people at present.

(3) We must let go and develop democracy, so that the representatives can fully express their opinions, criticize the government's work and the work style of cadres, and the criticized departments or cadres should conduct self-criticism in a timely manner.

(4) The people's representatives conferences and farmers' congresses should be well integrated.

Finally, I want to add that the situation of cadres in this province is: the ratio of new and old cadres in the province is nine to one. Generally speaking, old cadres have a glorious tradition of engaging in revolutionary work for a long time, and a high level of political awareness, integrity, simplicity, and hard work, but they do not understand the complex environment of the new area enough, and are prone to making simple and impatient or empiricist mistakes. New cadres have work enthusiasm and a relatively high level of education, but they do not understand the policies enough, and are not stable in grasping them, and are prone to making deviations in their work. Retained personnel are more familiar with general business, but they have a strong employment perspective, and their work enthusiasm is not high. Some people also have corrupt habits left over from the old society. Among the leading cadres, there is a fairly serious bureaucratic work style. Leading cadres, including myself, do not understand the overall situation enough, and are prone to being out of touch with reality when dealing with problems. Only arrangements are made for work, and inspections are rarely carried out, forming a situation of disconnection between the upper and lower levels. Therefore, the deviations and errors that occur in the work should first be the responsibility of the leading cadres, especially myself, and I should conduct a deep self-criticism. In addition, the unity between new and old cadres is not close enough. These shortcomings must be gradually overcome through work and study, and through criticism and self-criticism.

Other work in departments such as agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, industry and mining, transportation, trade, culture and education, health, and judiciary are all proceeding according to the original plan.

Summarizing the work of this province in the past five months, in the context of the new area environment, ethnic complexity, weak mass base, and insufficient cadre conditions, generally speaking, there have been achievements. As for all the shortcomings and errors, we will definitely work hard to correct them in the future.

That concludes my report. Please offer your criticism and guidance.

　　甘肃省工作报告
    （一九五零年六月二十六日在政务院第三十七次政务会议上的报告）
    甘肃省人民政府主席  邓宝珊总理，副总理，各位委员，各位同志：
    我代表甘肃省人民政府就五个月来的几项主要工作向中央人民政府政务院报告。
        一、剿匪肃特
    到今年二月为止，全省股匪已经大体肃清。总计自去年九月到今年二月，毙、伤、俘、降匪一万六千六百名，其中包括著名匪首马绍武等三十四名。缴获各种炮三十五门，各种枪枝一万一千二百八十一支。残余土匪，潜伏在边沿山地，总数约五千二百余人，正在继续清剿中。在肃特方面，管训重要特务分子六百八十九名，逮捕和管押潜伏及继续活动的特务三百四十三名。
    目前，残余匪特还在继续活动，企图挑拨民族间的感情，特别是制造回汉人民间的纠纷。今年四五月间，敌特勾结土匪，反动会门（一贯道、无极道、大刀队、红枪会等），马匪残余军官以及地方恶霸，裹胁群众，阴谋在清水、会川等县组织武装越狱，在兰州、皋兰、平凉、天水、固原、临夏、武威等地区组织武装骚动，由于当地群众的协助都先后被我破获。匪特并在各地散播谣言，打黑枪，放火，下毒，暗杀工作干部。根据公安部门所得材料，证明这一切的破坏活动，背后都有美帝国主义走狗蒋匪的阴谋指使。
    我们的剿匪肃特方针基本上是“军事清剿为主，政治瓦解为辅”；但对于民族聚居或杂居地区带有群众性的骚动，则依据共同纲领所规定的民族政策加以适当处理。为了彻底肃清匪特的活动，今后，我们要更进一步地联系群众，依靠群众。并且克服干部中的麻痹思想和太平观念，提高警惕。严禁乱打人，乱抓人的行为。广泛揭穿匪特和反动会门的欺骗宣传，使他们在群众中孤立起来。
    二、生产救灾，春耕和禁烟
    甲、生产救灾  本省遭受的灾荒，主要的是匪灾，以临夏分区为最重，灾民约四十万人，其中五万人衣食无着。损失粮食三十五万石，以及房屋，牲畜和其他财产总值在八十亿元以上。酒泉分区被土匪抢去牲畜一万余头，全分区人民有百分之三十没有口粮。此外，不少地区遭到风、雹、雨、冻、水、虫、鼠等灾害。据临夏、庆阳、平凉三个分区不完全的统计，十六个区，五十一个乡，遭灾的有二万二千六百余户，九万三千余人，受灾耕地面积二百二十八万九千余亩。牧畜区额齐纳旗因大水淹没草地，牲口饿死了一半。
    在生产救灾工作中，我们着重提出“生产自救为主，互助互济及政府救济为辅”的口号。把工作重点放在遭受匪灾最重的临夏分区，首先组织回汉人民团结委员会，宣传解释民族政策，发动灾民上庄。各村订立互助公约，帮助灾民找房屋，借粮食，并普遍组织变工，替灾民解决畜力的困难。现在绝大部分的灾民都已上庄，从事生产。
    各地农民并根据具体情况，利用一切可能条件，组织了运输、纺织、熬盐、背柴、积肥、挖药材等手工业和副业生产。例如通渭县有百分之五十以上的农民利用副业生产，解决了缺乏口粮和种籽的困难。
    省人民政府在临夏分区有重点地发放救济款一亿元，救济粮一千石。中央人民政府和西北军政委员会拨给甘肃的救济粮三万石，也已发放完毕。此外，部队、机关、团体和各地人民，发起救灾运动，募集粮食、现金和衣服，救济灾民。
    在政府与人民的共同努力下，甘肃全省基本上度过了灾荒。但在工作中，也发生了许多缺点。诸如调查研究工作做得不够，不能很好的了解灾情。临夏分区的领导干部，没有把执行民族政策和救灾工作密切结合起来，提出“先团结后救济”的口号，以致救济粮不能及时发放。
    乙、春耕  结合着生产救灾，省人民政府号召全省各地积极布置春耕工作。各地召开干部会议，拟订工作计划，讨论解决春耕中的困难问题，及时组织工作队下乡，督导和帮助春耕工作的进行，并且通过各界人民代表会和农代会，着重讨论了今年的春耕生产问题，订出具体办法。这里特别要指出的，是今年三月间召开的全省农民代表会议，对于甘肃今年的春耕工作，起了决定的作用。据各地报道：代表们回乡后，普遍带头积极生产，并广泛宣传各项政策，消除农民的顾虑，激发生产情绪。同时，战争结束，大股土匪肃清，农村安定，战勤负担免除，劳力畜力增加，也替今年的春耕工作创造了有利条件。张掖县农民群众说：“今年，一不逃兵役，二不避公粮，不搞生产干什么。”据化平县农民反映：“十年来也没有今年情绪高。”
    为了解决春耕中的困难，全省六万石小米的农业生产贷款在三月初就开始发放。而解放后一度停滞的农村自由借贷，由于农民代表和各级干部的宣传推动，转趋活跃。到五月中旬为止，据不完全统计：十个分区，五十二个县及兰州市，经自由借贷借出的粮食，估计总数在十五万石左右。以定西分区六个县的统计为例：互借粮一万二千九百九十石，政府贷款二千四百九十石，清理义仓及旧无息粮六百六十石，反霸斗争果实一千七百五十五石，共计一万七千九百九十五石，全部用于生产，解决了一万六千余户的困难。六县共有三百万亩的耕地，已经全部下种。
    在春耕中各地并普遍组织了各种的变工组。据八个分区，二十二个县和兰州市的不完全统计：共有三千四百八十一个变工组，包括一万七千二百八十六个劳动力，和二千一百八十七头牲畜。各地的变工组，都有相当数量的妇女参加。
    各地农民在政府协助下，积极整修旧有的小型水利和水车。皋兰等九县及兰州市，整修和新开的渠道共一百八十四公里，修好水车六十八辆，打井十五眼，总计可灌溉十万亩以上。
    根据酒泉、平凉、庆阳等七个分区以及兰州市、皋兰等五个县的报告，本省各地春耕播种已经基本完成。即使灾情最重的临夏分区，在动员灾民上庄抢种后，绝大部分耕地也已下种。此外，据皋兰等二十一个县不完全的统计：已开熟荒一千七百三十九亩，全部下种；生荒八万零一百零八亩，部分下种。至于棉田方面，本省原定今年增植一万亩。现据报告：仅皋兰等十一县和兰州市，就增植了三万六千多亩棉田，超过原有计划三倍半。农业机关并组织棉田防治工作组，在天水靖远防治棉田五千亩，估计可增产皮棉五万斤。不过，今春本省各地，除陇东陇南外，雨量普遍不足。截至五月底为止，部分地区如兰州市及定西分区，旱象已成。另外有些地方遭到了霜、风、雹灾和虫害，都使今年的生产受到影响。
    丙、禁烟  本省部分地区，在春耕前，发现农民受匪特的欺骗宣传，种植鸦片烟苗。据定西等四个分区，十一个县的不完全统计，共达六万六千余亩。经过各级政府在各界人民代表会、农代会及群众大会上，宣传禁烟，并组织工作组下乡展开禁烟工作，到五月上旬为止，种烟最多的皋兰县和临夏分区，已经大致铲完。其他如岷县、武威、天水、武都、酒泉等分区的烟苗，除穷山僻壤外，大部地区也已铲除。在工作中，各地干部一般的都能掌握政策，先向群众进行宣传解释，在群众觉悟的基础上着手铲除烟苗，改种庄稼。对于民族聚居或杂居地区，采取稳健步骤，尽量避免引起民族间的纠纷。但在藏民区夏河、卓尼等地，因地区过于辽阔，干部条件不够，加以部分藏民多年种烟；再如川甘边境的南坪区，一向是烟贩出没之地，市面以大烟代替货币流通，我们的力量还没有深入，禁烟工作的进行都比较困难。
    三、执行民族政策
    过去反动政府在甘肃长期实行的民族压迫政策，造成了各民族间歧视和隔阂的恶果。解放后由于匪特的挑拨，民族纠纷事件一触即发。去年临夏发生骚动的客观原因，主要在此。但该区领导干部犯了简单急燥和经验主义的错误，没有重视民族问题的历史性和复杂性，没有坚持民族平等与民族团结的政策，也予匪特以可乘之机。这是不应当存在的主观原因。中共和政府接受了临夏事件的教训，在该区进行了纠偏工作。停止收缴民间枪支。切实整训民兵。号召回汉人民加强团结，在平等的基础上“互相帮助，互相尊重，互不歧视，互不报复”。发动灾民上庄。依据“政治争取为主”的剿匪方针，由回汉人民组织肃匪委员会，配合人民解放军，进行剿匪工作。设立分区各民族代表协商委员会，县、区民族事务委员会。召开各族各界人民代表会，各族人民座谈会，回汉团结委员会和回汉人民团结会。订立回汉互助公约。到目前为止，该区境内的股匪全部肃清，社会秩序大体安定。绝大部分灾民都已上庄，回汉人民互助互济，合力展开了生产救灾和春耕工作。此外，该区到三月底为止共培养了二百五十名回藏干部，并提拔了一批回民干部担任副专员、市长、县长及县级科长等职务。
    临夏事件以后，本省民族工作更深入了一步，各族人民的觉悟程度普遍提高，民族间的团结日趋巩固。今年四五月间，匪特曾在平凉等地企图挑起民族间的骚动，但绝大多数人民都已认清匪特的阴谋，不受欺骗。并在政府和人民的努力下，很快地把事态平复下来。
    今年五月，省民族事务委员会正式成立，同时召开第一次委员会议，各委员都是各族人民中负有声望的人士，对本省的民族工作提出了许多宝贵的意见，并且决定在会后分赴民族聚居及杂居地区，进行慰问，宣传民族政策，加强民族间的团结。
    至于藏民区夏河、卓尼，已实行区域自治，由省人民政府直接领导。
    再如少数民族地区的经济贸易、文化教育、卫生、牧畜兽医等工作，也都已在逐渐开展中。
    总之，在甘肃，执行民族政策是头等重要而艰巨的任务，是一切工作的关键。必须把民族政策贯彻到每一个具体工作中去。首先要尽一切可能，消除民族间的歧视和隔阂，实现民族平等与团结互助。在民族聚居地区，实行区域自治。尊重少数民族风俗习惯和宗教信仰。大量培养和提拔少数民族的干部。在一切方面，尽量对少数民族人民予以照顾。加强干部的民族政策教育，坚决反对大民族主义的思想，纠正工作中的缺点。
    四、进行农村民主改革
    本省新区农村今年普遍实行减租。到秋收以后，在条件已经成熟的部分地区，进行分配土地的改革，现已着手各项准备工作。今年的土地改革只是局部的，主要是重点试办，吸取经验，训练干部，替明后年进行大规模土地改革创造条件。其余地区，继续进行剿匪肃特，反霸减租，组织农民，削弱封建势力。至于在民族杂居或聚居的地区，需要采取更稳妥的步骤，目前首先集中力量促进各族人民的团结，将来如何进行民主改革，应分别根据各少数民族人民的觉悟、需要及其他条件来决定。
    关于清理债务问题，本省规定凡是解放前的旧债，一律按照西北军政委员会颁发的减租清债条例处理。解放后农村中的自由借贷，必须有借有还，政府对债权加以保护。
    五、统一财经工作
    自今年三月间，政务院发布关于统一国家财经工作决定的指示后，西北大行政区召开了西北财政会议，本省亦于四月间召开省财政会议。对于过去的工作进行全面检讨，指出成绩和缺点，对于今后的工作做了新的布置。并且根据中央人民政府及西北军政委员会的指示，在收入增加、支出减少的基础上，经过精打细算，制订了本省一九五零年的新概算。这个概算如能切实执行，不仅消减了本省今年旧概算中百分之七十二点四五的财政赤字，百分之六十一的粮食赤字，并可能有若干剩余。这是本省财政上空前的成就。
    新旧概算的比较：过去制订旧概算时，粗枝大叶，人员马匹都没有精确的核实，并且由于百废俱兴的思想而造成了事业费的庞大支出。以公营事业而言，当时就占了总概算的百分之三十一点九，其中交通占百分之五十四，企业支出占百分之三十七，农林水利占百分之三点七，盐务支出占百分之五点三。而在新概算中，收入增加，只税收一项，便增加了百分之二十八点七四，再加上公债、企业利润和折旧，总计可以增加百分之四十三点五八。同时，支出方面，因为各种事业费大量核减，例如邮政支出就全部取销。经过整编机构，核实人数，减少了百分之二十三点二的工作人员，消灭了空额。加以今年的服装由西北大行政区统筹制发，节省了本省一笔大的支出。这样，新概算的支出比旧概算就减少了百分之七十三点三一，使原来的财政赤字完全消灭。
    至于粮食方面，由于人员马匹的精简核实，减少了旧概算中十个月需要粮的百分之二十一点三九，再加上全省工作人员每人每日节省口粮一两，牲口每匹每日省料一斤，应放麦三个月，基本上消灭了粮食赤字。
    以上的情况，使甘肃的财政改变了过去的面貌。当然，这还需要我们继续不断的努力，来争取新概算的全部实现。到今年五月底，在收入方面，去年冬季各项税收完成了百分之八十左右，今年第一季度税收已经开征，其中盐税迄四月份为止，已完成百分之七十三。所有尾欠正在催缴中。公粮入仓已完成百分之八十以上，尾欠数除临夏、武都、徽县等地因匪灾不能如数完成外，其余都可于最近入仓。夏征已开始布置。第一期公债原配额八十万七千一百二十六分，已缴库七十七万四千七百九十七分，完成百分之九十六，其中兰州市超额完成。由于财政机构、制度和干部的不健全，漏税偷税达三分之一以上。对于公粮的保管工作做得不够，不少仓站的粮食发生霉坏，例如广阳分区六个县就坏了二十一万多斤粮。某些地区公债推销有强迫命令、平均摊派的偏向。在节省支出方面，本省整编工作正在进行。省级各机关已经完成。并裁撤岷县、张掖两个分区。财政、企业以及各机关小公家务的清库工作已经开始。在事业费的分配上，分别轻重绥急，重点使用。在统一收支管理方面，本省七十二个县中，已有六十三县设立金融机构。金库、粮库亦已开始建立。取消机动，严格执行中央规定的财政制度。
    三月以来，甘肃金融物价相当稳定。据人民银行甘肃分行统计：兰州市三月份存款为六十三亿，四月份增至三百零二亿，增加了百分之五百，存户较三月份增加了百分之六十。四月份货币回笼占全省流通额的百分之四十。至于物价方面兰州市三月份平均下跌百分之十五点九，四月份下跌百分之四十四点二。这证明了统一财经工作已经有了显著成就，对于绝大多数人民是有利的。至于目前部分工商业的萧条现象，主要是由于农村购买力薄弱，农产品价格过低。同时外来的工业品因交通不便，运费太大，很难销售。本省的企业因设备与管理不善，技术落后，成本过高，或因盲目生产，不能面对农村，形成滞销。这种情形公私企业都有，现正在设法调整改善中。不过，要彻底好转须在土地改革完成以后。
    六、各界人民代表会议
    本省各县、市到五月底为止，先后召开了一次以上的各界人民代表会议。据统计：开过两次的有三十一县，一次的有四十一县。三万人口以上的城市：兰州、天水开过三次，平凉、武威两次，临夏、酒泉一次。代表产生的方式，是以选举与聘请相配合。县人代会，农民代表平均占百分之五十，兰州市人代会，工人代表占百分之二十二。在民族杂居地区，少数民族的代表，占有相当名额。民主人士和开明士绅也有代表参加。
    除临夏以外，各县都已开过一次以上的农代会。平凉、定西开过两次以上。全省四百八十五个区中，开过农代会的占百分之七十。三千六百八十个乡中，开过农代会的占百分之五十七。今年三月间，召开全省农民代表会议，出席代表六百余人，五月间召开了全省职工代表大会。
    各县的人代会和农代会，大都讨论了剿匪肃特、反霸、征粮、建政、生产救灾、春耕、减租清债、组织农会等问题。城市的人代会着重讨论恢复与发展工业生产，调整劳资关系，开展城乡贸易，整顿税收等问题。在民族杂居或聚居地区，着重讨论民族团结互助，提高少数民族经济文化生活等问题。
    省农代会通过了一九五零年甘肃农村工作任务，农会组织章程，讨论了生产救灾、春耕、减租清债、土地改革，并选举了省农会委员会。省工代会通过了一九五零年工会工作任务，选举了省工会委员会。农代会中，以省农代会开的最成功，特别对于今年的春耕生产，起了决定作用。人代会中以通渭县第二届人代会开得最好。一般的说来，各地人代会农代会，第二次比第一次要进步些，收效要多些。下半年预定召开全省各界人民代表会议，现已开始筹备。
    在工作中需要改善的是：
    （一）选举或聘请代表时，应该更广泛地团结各民主阶层的代表参加，增加少数民族代表的名额，以扩大各民族各界人民民主统一战线。
    （二）准备工作要做得够。议题要适合当前人民的迫切要求。
    （三）要放手发扬民主，使代表们能够充分的发表意见，对政府工作及干部作风展开批评，被批评的部门或干部并应及时地进行自我批评。
    （四）把各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议很好的结合起来。
    最后，我要附带说到的，是本省的干部情况。甘肃全省新老干部的比例，是九与一之比。一般的说来，老干部有长期从事革命工作的光荣传统，和高度的政治水平，廉洁朴素，吃苦耐劳，但对于新区复杂环境了解不够，容易犯简单急躁，或经验主义的毛病。新干部富有工作热情和较高的文化水准，但对于政策了解不够，掌握不稳，容易在工作中发生偏向。留用人员对于一般的业务比较熟悉，但雇佣观点浓厚，工作情绪不高，部分人员还带着旧社会遗留下来的腐败习气。在领导干部中间，存在着相当严重的官僚主义作风。领导干部，连我自己在内，对于全面情况了解不够，处理问题容易脱离实际。工作只有布置很少检查，形成了上下脱节的现象。因此，在工作中所发生的偏差和错误，首先应该由领导干部负责，特别是我个人，更应该进行深刻的自我检讨。此外，新老干部间的团结也不够密切。这些缺点，必须通过工作与学习，进行批评与自我批评，来逐步的加以克服。
    其他如农林、水利、牧畜、工矿、交通、贸易、文教、卫生、司法等部门的工作，都按照原定计划进行。
    总结本省五个月来的工作，在新区环境、民族复杂、群众基础薄弱、干部条件不够的情况下，大体上说来是有成绩的。至于所有的缺点和错误，今后一定努力纠正。
    我的报告到此为止，请各位多加批评和指导。
