　　Jilin Examines All County Heads
    Many County Heads Are Unfamiliar with Policies and Need to Intensify Their Learning of New Things
    [Our Newspaper] According to the Jilin Daily: The Jilin Provincial People's Government held an examination for all county heads during the provincial county head conference on June 6th. A total of twenty-two people participated in the examination (including one commissioner, four deputy county heads, and the rest were county or banner heads). The test questions were divided into two parts: civil affairs and finance and economics. The results of the test: the average score for the civil affairs test questions was 40 points, and only three county or banner heads passed; the average score for the finance and economics test questions was 38 points, and only two county heads passed. This examination revealed that most county heads are unfamiliar with policies and important business. For example, regarding questions such as the county people's representative conference exercising the functions and powers of the county people's congress, and the scope of functions and powers of the standing committee of the county people's representative conference and the people's supervision committee inspection office, only a very small number of answers were relatively complete, many answers were incomplete, and some were even wrong; some even answered the "difference between people and citizens" as "citizens refers to all the people in the country."

    Regarding the question "Your county's cooperative's second-quarter sales task," only one person answered it completely correctly, and one person answered it almost correctly; in addition, eight people's answers were very different, and eleven people handed in blank papers. Regarding the question "The difference between production finance and supply finance and the scope of business," most answers were very vague and could not distinguish between the two. Regarding the question "The difference between direct tax and indirect tax," only three people answered correctly, and more than half could not distinguish them. Some people even described income tax as an indirect tax and business tax as a direct tax. Regarding the question "What is the currency situation in your county? What is the impact on market prices and urban-rural exchange?", generally, they only knew that "rural money is tight," and listed some phenomena, but rarely analyzed the reasons.

    When publishing the above news, the Jilin Daily published a short commentary. The short commentary pointed out: The topics of this examination were generally important common sense in terms of policy and business. As long as you pay attention to it usually, you can answer it. However, only five people passed, which shows that everyone's learning is still not enough. The county head should be very familiar with the people's democratic power and the main economic situation and work tasks of the county. However, judging from the answers, many people's understanding of the division of powers and the basic differences between supply finance and production finance is still vague. This will inevitably affect the performance of duties and the leadership of the county's financial work, and the guiding principle of serving production and construction cannot be implemented. This not only shows that learning is not enough, but also shows that everyone's work is not thorough. The short commentary believes that "this situation is worth everyone's vigilance." It calls on everyone: "We must step up the study of policies and important businesses, and step up the study of new things, so as to improve our work one step further on the existing basis."

### 吉林测验全省县长  许多县长不熟悉政策业务需要加紧对新事物的学习

　　吉林测验全省县长
    许多县长不熟悉政策业务需要加紧对新事物的学习
    【本报讯】吉林日报消息：吉林省人民政府在六月六日召开全省县长会议时，举行了一次县长测验。参加测验的共二十二人（其中专员一人，副县长四人，余均为县长或旗长）。测验题分民政、财经两部分。测验的结果：民政试题平均四十分，及格者仅有县、旗长三人；财经试题平均三十八分，及格者仅有县长二人。此次测验暴露了大部分县长对政策与重要业务均不熟悉。如对于县人民代表会议代行县人民代表大会职权、县人民代表会议常务委员会与人民监察委员会检查署的职权范围等题，仅有很少数答案比较完全，许多答得不完全，还有答错的；甚至有人把“人民与国民的区别”答为“国民是指全国所有的人民”。
    对于《你县合作社第二季推销任务》一题，只有一个人完全答对，一个人答得差不多；此外，八个人答得相差很远，还有十一个人交白卷。对于《生产财政与供给财政的区别及业务范围》一题，多数答案很模糊，分不出两者的区别。对于《直接税与间接税的区别》一题，只有三个人答对，半数以上分不清。有的人竟把所得税说成间接税，把营业税答成直接税。对于《你县货币情况如何？对市场价格、城乡交流的影响如何？》一题，一般都只知道“农村银根紧”，罗列了一些现象，很少分析原因。
    吉林日报在刊出上述消息时，发表了短论。短论指出：这次测验的题目，一般的都是政策与业务方面的重要常识。只要平时比较留意，都可以答上来。但及格者仅有五人，这说明大家的学习还很不够。县长对于人民民主政权，对于本县主要的经济情况与工作任务，都应该是很熟悉的。但从答案上看，许多人对职权划分、供给财政与生产财政的基本区别等的认识还是模糊的。这样，势将影响到执行职务与领导全县的财政工作，不能贯彻为生产建设服务的方针。这不但说明学习不够，也说明大家的工作不深入。短论认为“这种情况值得大家警惕”。号召大家：“必须加紧政策与重要业务的学习，加紧对新事物的学习；以便在现有基础上把工作提高一步。”
