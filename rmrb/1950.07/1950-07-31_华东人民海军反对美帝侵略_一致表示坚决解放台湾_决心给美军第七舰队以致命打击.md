[Report from our Newspaper Correspondent] News from the "East China People's Navy": The entire army of the East China Military Region's People's Navy is filled with immense indignation at the US imperialists' outrageous act of armed intervention in Korea and their brazen "order to the Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Taiwan." They have expressed that no matter how the US imperialists obstruct, they, like the Korean people, are determined to liberate every inch of their motherland's territory. Commander and Political Commissar Zhang Aiping pointed out in a special article that "This shameless act of aggression by the US imperialists can only increase some difficulties for us in liberating Taiwan, and can never stop our determination and confidence in liberating Taiwan." Rao Zijian, Commander and Political Commissar of the South China Sea Fleet, said: "The Chinese people and the People's Army will strike the aggressors with their consistent national heroic spirit! Our People's Navy will also use its full strength to inflict a fatal blow on the US imperialist armed forces—the Seventh Fleet—who dare to invade our territory!" Cadres and soldiers of a certain warship held a discussion, and everyone unanimously believed that the US action is only one of his thousands of schemes to invade the people of Asia. Loader Yan Xiangmin said: "The US aggression against China and Korea has increased the indignation of people all over the world, and has strengthened the unity and strength of people all over the world!" Signalman Xia Zhiqiang then gave an example: "Before the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the US Seventh Fleet sent many warships, wildly shouting that it would 'defend the natural barrier of the Yangtze River' and 'defend Greater Shanghai.' As a result, as soon as the People's Liberation Army reached the outskirts of Shanghai County, it ran away!" Everyone believed that the US imperialists are used to using intimidation tactics, "If you are frightened by him and dare not attack Taiwan, then you will fall into his trap! Haven't the Korean people beaten the US invading army to a pulp?!" Many comrades who revolted from the Kuomintang Navy cited examples of what they had seen and heard in the past, saying: "American warships even have dance floors for dancing, enjoying pleasure, and indulging in corruption. How can they fight?" When everyone read the news that the Korean People's Navy's torpedo boats had sunk an American cruiser, they excitedly said: "American warships are nothing more than that!" After reviewing his past 麻痹 [paralysis, carelessness, laxity] thinking, Lu Mingxu of the main gun crew firmly said: "If the US imperialists fire one shot at us, I will fire a thousand shots at them!" Jiang Haiqing said: "As long as they dare to attack, we will wipe them out! The task of our People's Navy is to liberate Taiwan, consolidate coastal defense, and defend against imperialist aggression!" Finally, everyone unanimously expressed: Learn from the Korean People's Navy, quickly master technology, strengthen will, and make full preparations for the liberation of Taiwan. They also submitted a letter of guarantee to the higher-level Party committee.

　　华东人民海军反对美帝侵略
    一致表示坚决解放台湾           
    决心给美军第七舰队以致命打击
    【本报讯】华东人民海军报记者报道：对美帝国主义武装干涉朝鲜和悍然“命令第七舰队阻止对台湾的任何攻击”的穷凶极恶的侵略行为，华东军区人民海军全军愤慨万分，表示不管美帝如何阻挠，我们和朝鲜人民一样，一定要坚决解放祖国的每一寸疆土。张爱萍司令员兼政委在专论中指出，“美帝这种无耻的侵略行动，只能增加我们解放台湾的若干困难，决不可能阻止我们解放台湾的决心和信心。”南海舰队饶子健司令员兼政委表示：“中国人民和人民军队，将以一贯的民族的英雄气概，给侵略者以打击！我们人民海军也必以充分的力量，给敢于侵略我国领土的美帝武装——第七舰队以致命打击！”某军舰干部和小兵曾举行座谈会，大家一致认为：美帝这一行动仅是他千万件侵略亚洲人民的勾当之一。装填手阎翔民说：“美国对中国和朝鲜的侵略，更增加了全世界人民的愤慨，更增强了全世界人民的团结和力量！”信号士夏志强接着举了一个例子说：“解放军渡江之前，美帝第七舰队开来许多军舰，狂吹要“保卫长江天险”、“保卫大上海”，结果解放军才打到上海县城外围，它就溜之大吉了！”大家认为美帝国主义者就惯于使用恫吓手段，“你给他吓住了，不敢打台湾，那就正中了他的圈套！朝鲜人民还不是把美国侵略军队打得落花流水？！”许多从国民党海军起义过来的同志纷纷举出过去所见所闻的事例说：“美国军舰上还要辟舞池跳舞，享乐腐化，还能打仗？”大家读到朝鲜人民海军鱼雷艇打沉美国巡洋舰的通讯时，兴奋地说：“美国军舰不过如此！”主炮组吕明绪检讨了自己过去存在的麻痹思想后，坚定地说：“美帝要打我们一炮，我就打他一千炮！”江海清说：“只要他敢打，我们就消灭他！我们人民海军的任务就是解放台湾、巩固海防，防御帝国主义的侵略！”最后大家一致表示：向朝鲜人民海军学习，迅速熟练技术、坚定意志，为解放台湾作好充分准备。他们并向上级党委呈递了保证书。
