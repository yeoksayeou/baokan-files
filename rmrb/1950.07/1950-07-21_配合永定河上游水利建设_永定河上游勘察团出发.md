To Cooperate with the Yongding River Upper Reaches Water Conservancy Construction
    Yongding River Upper Reaches Survey Team Departs
    [Report from this newspaper] The Yongding River Upper Reaches Soil and Water Conservation Survey Team, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, departed from Beijing on July 11th. The survey team includes personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, the Academy of Sciences, the North China Water Conservancy Bureau, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Office, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Chahar Provincial People's Government, and other organizations, as well as professors and students from Beijing Agricultural University and Nanjing Ginling Women's University, totaling twenty-one people. It is planned to conduct surveys in the Sanggan River and Yang River upper reaches area within two months, along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line via Huailai, Xuanhua, Zhangjiakou to Datong, then turning to Shanyin, Shuoxian, Yuxian, Shixia, Zhuolu and other places. The team's mission is to investigate and study the soil, water conservancy, meteorology, crops, forests, and other conditions in the aforementioned areas, with the aim of carrying out soil and water conservation work in a planned and step-by-step manner in this area, so as to cooperate with the Yongding River reservoir project plan.
    The cultivated land in the upper reaches of the Yongding River accounts for only 17 percent of the total area. A vast area is alkaline wasteland and arid wasteland. If planned construction is carried out in terms of wind prevention, sand control, and water conservancy and irrigation, so that these lands can be rationally utilized, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and other industries will have great development.

　　配合永定河上游水利建设
    永定河上游勘察团出发
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部组织的永定河上游水土保持勘察团，已于七月十一日由京出发。勘察团包括农业部、林垦部、科学院、华北水利局、官厅水库工程处、华北农业科学研究所、察哈尔省人民政府等机关团体的工作人员，以及北京农业大学、南京金陵女子大学的教授、学生等共二十一人。预定在两个月内，沿京绥线经怀来、宣化、张家口至大同，再折向山阴、朔县、蔚县、石匣、涿鹿等地，在桑干河、洋河上游一带进行勘察。该团的任务是调查、研究上述地区的土壤、水利、气象、农作、森林等情况，以期在这一地带有计划有步骤地进行水土保持工作，借以配合永定河水库工程计划。
    永定河上游已耕地仅占总面积的百分之十七，广大面积都是碱荒地和干旱荒地，如从防风防沙和水利灌溉等方面实施有计划的建设，使这些土地得以合理利用，则农业、牧业、林业等均将有很大的发展。
