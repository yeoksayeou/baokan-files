　　I. Why Defend World Peace? Why Sign the World Peace Congress Declaration?
    The world now has two paths: the path of war and the path of peace. The aggressive camp headed by U.S. imperialism wants to provoke a world war to achieve its goal of dominating the world, while the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is determined to defend world peace. A world war would cause great sacrifices to the lives and property of people in all countries, so the people of all countries are firmly opposed to a new world war. The declaration of the World Peace Congress represents the will of the people of all countries. By signing this declaration, we are expressing our determination to join with the people of all countries to oppose the imperialist aggressive camp's provocation of a new world war.

    II. Does the fact that the imperialist camp wants to provoke a world war mean that the imperialists are strong? Does our opposition to a world war mean that we are weak?

    That's not the case. German imperialism provoked two world wars, but both times it failed. Japanese imperialism invaded China and participated in the world war, but it was overthrown. Chiang Kai-shek in China provoked a domestic war, and he was overthrown. It is evident that the challenger does not necessarily win. U.S. imperialism wants to provoke a new world war, but if a new world war is really provoked by it, the result will certainly be the overthrow of the entire imperialist system, because on balance, the strength of the peace camp is now greater than the strength of the imperialist camp. Since this is the case, why does U.S. imperialism still want to challenge? Firstly, the challenger thinks it can win, and secondly, it wants to intimidate people. But in fact, both of these will fail. Since this is the case, why do we still oppose a world war? Because although we can win in a world war, the people will have to make great sacrifices in the war. We should strive to achieve victory under conditions of world peace. We do not want a world war and must try to stop it. However, if a world war is still provoked by adventurers, we must disregard sacrifices and strive to eliminate the enemy in the war.

    III. Why Ban Atomic Bombs? Can a Country Win a War Just by Having Atomic Bombs?

    An atomic bomb is a very destructive bomb, so its use must be banned. But this does not mean that the atomic bomb can determine the outcome of a war. The United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, killing many Japanese people, but it was the Soviet army that wiped out the main force of the Japanese army. The Soviet Union also has atomic bombs, but because atomic bombs are too inhumane, the Soviet Union also firmly advocates banning atomic bombs.

    IV. Can a New World War Be Prevented? Is American Intervention in Korea and Taiwan the Start of World War III?

    As long as the peace and democratic forces of all countries in the world strengthen their unity and step up their efforts, a new world war can be prevented. U.S. imperialism runs rampant everywhere, and looks very fierce, but the more rampant it is, the more it will arouse the opposition of the people of all countries, and the more it will isolate itself, eventually leading to failure, just like Hitler. Therefore, this action of the United States cannot stop the development of world peace and democratic forces. American intervention in Korea and Taiwan is one such act of running rampant. Although American intervention has temporarily added some difficulties to Korea and China, it has simultaneously exposed the face of imperialism to the world, increased many direct enemies, and forced it to expend great effort in Korea and Taiwan, creating a dilemma for itself. So, overall, the difficulties for the United States are greater. When Japan invaded China in 1937, Japan used more than one million ground troops, in addition to air and naval forces. At that time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army not only had no air or naval forces, but also no modernized ground forces. The number of the People's Liberation Army was also very small, but the Japanese invaders were still surrounded in the Chinese liberated areas and eventually defeated by the Chinese people. After World War II, France attacked Vietnam, using hundreds of thousands of troops, and using naval, land, and air forces. The Vietnamese people, like the People's Liberation Army in the War of Resistance Against Japan, not only had no air or naval forces, but also no modernized ground forces. But after fighting in Vietnam for four years, Vietnam liberated more than 90% of its land. Now that the United States is invading Korea, it has not sent many troops, and Korea has a modernized regular army, so the United States will inevitably encounter greater difficulties in South Korea than Japan and France did. This invasion by the United States is not the beginning of World War III, and as long as the invaded countries put up correct and effective resistance and give the United States a thorough lesson, it can make a new world war even more difficult to occur.

    V. Are We Opposed to All Wars?

    We oppose imperialist wars of aggression, but we do not oppose just wars waged for anti-aggression, because the purpose of such anti-aggression wars is also to defend world peace. There are several types of wars against aggression and for the defense of peace. Some are wars of national independence waged by colonial peoples against imperialism, and some are wars waged by the revolutionary people of all countries against the reactionaries in their own countries. The more these wars develop, the greater the strength of the peace camp and the smaller the possibility of a new world war occurring. The Chinese people's war to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and the Korean people's war to eliminate Syngman Rhee and the American aggressors are both very important ways to punish challengers and defend world peace.

### 保卫世界和平宣言签名运动周宣传要点  中国保卫世界和平大会委员会发

　　保卫世界和平宣言签名运动周宣传要点
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会发
    一、为什么要保卫世界和平？为什么要在世界拥护和平大会宣言上签名？
    世界现在有两条路：一条是战争的路，一条是和平的路。以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营想要挑起世界大战，以达到它们统治世界的目的，以苏联为首的和平阵营坚决保卫世界和平。世界大战要使各国人民的生命财产受到很大的牺牲，所以各国人民坚决反对新的世界战争。世界拥护和平大会的宣言是代表了各国人民的这种意志的。我们在这个宣言上签名，就是表示我们决心和各国人民一起，反对帝国主义侵略阵营挑起新的世界战争。
    二、帝国主义阵营想要挑起世界大战，是不是表示帝国主义者的力量强？我们反对世界大战，是不是表示我们的力量弱？
    不是这样。德国帝国主义两次挑起世界大战，但是两次都失败了。日本帝国主义侵略中国并且参加世界大战，但是被打倒了。中国的蒋介石挑起国内战争，他被打倒了。可见挑战的人并不就能胜利。美帝国主义想要挑起新的世界大战，但是如果新的世界大战真的被它挑动起来，结果一定是整个帝国主义被打倒，因为整个计算起来，现在和平阵营的力量要比帝国主义阵营的力量更大。既然这样，美帝国主义为什么还要挑战呢？因为一来挑战的人自以为能胜利，二来他还想把人吓倒。但是事实上这两样都是要落空的。既然这样，我们为什么还反对世界大战呢？因为我们虽然能在世界战争中取得胜利，但是人民在战争中究竟要有很大的牺牲，我们应当力争在世界和平的条件下取得胜利。我们不要世界战争，要努力把它制止住，但是万一世界战争仍然被冒险分子挑动起来，我们就要不顾牺牲，努力在战争中把敌人消灭掉。
    三、为什么要禁止原子弹？是不是有了原子弹就能打胜仗？
    原子弹是一种杀伤力很大的炸弹，所以必须禁止使用。但是这并不是说，原子弹就能够决定战争的胜负。美国在日本投过两颗原子弹，杀伤了很多日本人民，但是消灭日本陆军主力的还是苏联军。苏联也有原子弹，但是因为原子弹太不人道，所以苏联也坚决主张禁止原子弹。
    四、新的世界大战能不能制止？美国干涉朝鲜台湾是不是世界三次大战的开始？
    只要全世界各国和平民主力量加紧团结，加紧努力，新的世界大战是能够制止的。美帝国主义到处横行，看起来很凶，其实它愈是横行，愈要引起各国人民的反对，愈要使自己孤立起来，最后归于失败，和希特勒一样。所以美国的这种行动，并不能阻止世界和平民主力量的发展。美国干涉朝鲜和台湾，就是这种横行的一种。美国的干涉虽然暂时使朝鲜和中国增加一些困难，但是同时使美国向全世界暴露了帝国主义的面孔，增加了很多直接的敌人，不能不花很大的力气在朝鲜和台湾，造成它自己进退两难的地位。所以总起来看，还是美国的困难更大。当一九三七年日本进攻中国的时候，日本使用了陆军一百多万人，此外还用了空军和海军，而当时中国人民解放军不但没有海空军，而且没有近代化的陆军，人民解放军的人数也很少，但是日本侵略者仍然被围在中国解放区，最后并被中国人民所战胜。法国在世界第二次大战以后进攻越南，用的兵也有十几万，海陆空军都用了，而越南人民也和抗日战争中的人民解放军一样，不但没有海空军，也没有近代化的陆军，但是在法国打了四年之后，越南却解放了百分之九十以上的土地。现在美国侵略朝鲜，出的兵并不多，朝鲜又有近代化的正规军，所以美国一定要在南朝鲜受到比日本和法国更大的困难。美国的这次侵略，不是世界第三次大战的开端，而且只要被侵略各国作正确有效的抵抗，把美国切实教育一番，还可以使新的世界大战更难于发生。
    五、我们是不是反对一切战争？
    我们反对帝国主义侵略战争，但是不反对为了反侵略而进行的正义战争，因为这种反侵略战争的目的也是保卫世界和平。反对侵略保卫和平的战争有几种，有的是殖民地人民反抗帝国主义的民族独立战争，有的是各国革命人民反抗本国反动派的战争。这些战争愈发展，和平阵营的力量就愈大，新的世界大战发生的可能性就愈小。中国人民消灭蒋介石的战争和朝鲜人民消灭李承晚和美国侵略者的战争，就都是制裁挑战分子，保卫世界和平的一种很重要的方法。
