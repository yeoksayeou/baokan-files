　　Lost Public Bonds Cannot Be Replaced

To the Editor:

　　I carelessly lost 156 shares of one-point denomination public bonds, numbered 24729270-24729426, which I received from the Yincheng branch of the bank. I immediately reported the loss to the bank (Yincheng branch) and asked the district government police station to investigate, but they were unable to find them. Can I declare them void in the newspaper and apply for replacements?

　　The People's Bank of China has answered your question regarding the loss of public bonds as follows:

　　This issue of public bonds is in unregistered form, so replacements cannot be issued for lost bonds. Because when the principal and interest are repaid in the future, the bonds can be redeemed anywhere, it is extremely difficult to find the relevant numbers; even if they are found, the bank cannot be held responsible for withholding them.

### 遗失公债券不能挂失补领

　　遗失公债券不能挂失补领编辑同志：
    本人不慎，将荫城支行领到之二四七二九二七○——二四七二九四二六号一分券公债一百五十六分遗失。当即到银行挂失（荫城行），并报告区政府派出所查询，亦未查出。请问是否能在报纸上声明作废补领？
                               长治县西大镇车掌则车掌则君：
    你遗失公债券的问题，已经中国人民银行总行解答如下：
    本期公债为不记名式，故不能挂失补券。因为将来还本付息时，债券兑取本息不限地区，该项号码极难发现；即使发现，银行亦不能负责代为扣留。
