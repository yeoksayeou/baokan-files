The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia issued a statement severely condemning U.S. intervention in Korea as an outrageous act of aggression that violates the UN Charter and undermines world peace. It demanded an end to imperialist interference in Korea and other Asian countries, allowing the people of Korea, Malaya, Vietnam, and other colonies to freely decide their own internal affairs. Australian newspapers reported an increasing number of protests against U.S. intervention in Korea. The Miners' Federation newspaper, "Common Cause," called for support for the right of the people of Korea, Malaya, and other countries to determine their own destiny. The Building Workers' Industrial Union of the Sydney area unanimously condemned U.S. intervention as an open act of aggression.

In France, the Metalworkers' Union of the Seine region and the Joint Committee of Steelworkers' Unions passed a resolution calling on workers in the industry to hold demonstrations and strikes in factories to support the just struggle of the Korean people.

The "Finnish Peace Advocates" Association issued a statement on July 9, emphasizing that the entire responsibility for the development of the situation in Korea should be borne by the South Korean puppets and their American masters.

Danish peace advocates protested against the U.S. aggression against Korea and Denmark's participation in the U.S. military plan.

In the Netherlands, the working people continue to protest against the U.S. aggression in Korea and oppose the order for Dutch destroyers to sail to Korean waters. Youth and women's groups in Amsterdam have issued protests. The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth Daily" published an article by the General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, Groot, exposing the bloody adventures of the U.S. aggressors in Korea and calling on the Dutch working class to concentrate its efforts on opposing the war.

Mass rallies, meetings, and demonstrations were held throughout Israel to protest against U.S. intervention in Korea and to condemn the Israeli government's policy of supporting Anglo-American aggressors. Protest demonstrations were held in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, and demonstrators in Tel Aviv held a rally in front of the U.S. Consulate.
