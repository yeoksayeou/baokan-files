To the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace:

The American imperialists have illegally armed and invaded Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam, and have used their navy to invade our Taiwan, attempting to obstruct our People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan and disrupting peace in the Far East. The people of all circles in Zhangzhou express their infinite anger at this. Zhangzhou is located at the forefront of liberating Taiwan, and we firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement that Taiwan is our territory, and we must liberate it. The affairs of Asia should be managed by the Asian people themselves, and imperialism is not allowed to interfere. The people of Zhangzhou are determined to fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and to support the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Far Eastern countries, to crush the new aggression of American imperialism, and to fight for guaranteeing peace in the Far East and world peace.
                                      Zhangzhou People's Anti-American Imperialist Aggression Conference, respectfully

To the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace:

As we celebrate the victory of the Chinese people and commemorate the 13th anniversary of the "July 7th" Resistance War with great excitement, U.S. President Truman has issued an illegal statement inciting aggressive war, announcing the use of the navy to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan and armed intervention in Korea. The 100,000 people of Jining City express their utmost anger at this crime of threatening world peace and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We fully support Chairman Mao's call and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and firmly oppose the aggression of American imperialism. We know that the American imperialists are only paper tigers, and the victorious Chinese people are not afraid of Truman's intimidation. We have the determination and the power to crush all provocations by imperialism and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan; Taiwan will always belong to the Chinese people. We fully support the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. Half of the city's people have already signed the peace declaration and continue to implement the signature campaign. We are determined to take practical actions of actively producing and strengthening various constructions, unite all forces, give the war-mongers a head-on blow, and consolidate our victory.

Our slogans are: Asian people unite! Drive out the American aggressors! Oppose the running dogs of the aggressors! Use the Asian national liberation struggle to defend world peace! Long live the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War!

                                       Jining City "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War 13th Anniversary Peace Signature Conference
