　　On the "New Public Finance Outline"
　　Reader Ding Xintian's letter:
　　Editor,
　　Recently, I read Mr. Qian Jiaju's "New Public Finance Outline," published by Sanlian Bookstore in April 1950. This is a monumental work of public finance, explaining financial theories and analyzing financial problems. I found some issues, and because your space is limited, I will only raise one fundamental question for study.
　　When I read the section on agricultural tax in the book, I found the following sentence on page 166: "However, since the land reform, land rent no longer exists, and rent and tax have become one. A portion of the public grain (i.e., agricultural tax) paid by farmers is actually the former land rent, and a portion is the land tax. In other words, in the past, farmers gave this portion to the landlords, but now, due to the elimination of the landlord class, the state has taken the position of the landlord and replaced them. 'Public grain' is the sum of land rent and land tax... Since the current agricultural tax contains the nature of land rent..." Perhaps due to my limited theoretical level, I cannot deeply understand the meaning of this passage. I agree with Mr. Qian's financial theory of classifying land tax as a central tax, but I believe that under the people's regime, the state has not taken the position of the landlord and replaced them. Is it correct to say that "'public grain' is the sum of land rent and land tax"? What is the correct explanation of land tax (agricultural tax)? Please forward this to Mr. Qian for his guidance. It would be best if Mr. Qian's answer could be published in your journal, as this would be beneficial to the majority of readers.

　　Author Qian Jiaju's reply to Mr. Xintian:
　　Your letter forwarded by the People's Daily is acknowledged with respect. You pointed out that the explanation of land tax and land rent on page 166 of my book "New Public Finance Outline" is indeed problematic. My intention was to say that in areas that have undergone land reform, land rent no longer exists, and farmers are no longer subject to exploitation for the portion of land rent they were forced to pay in the past, but only bear the national public grain. Therefore, although the burden of public grain on farmers in the old liberated areas is quite heavy, the lives of farmers have greatly improved. But in the original work, I added, "The state has taken the position of the landlord and replaced them, and public grain is the sum of land rent and land tax," which can easily lead people to misunderstand that we are implementing the land nationalization policy of capitalist countries. This statement is incorrect. I should correct it and deeply thank you for your instruction.
　　My book was written during the rule of the Kuomintang, and it is inevitable that there are many viewpoints that are incorrect or inappropriate in wording. Recently, I plan to thoroughly revise it, and I hope you will give me more guidance.
　　Qian Jiaju

### 关于“新财政学大纲”

　　关于“新财政学大纲”
    读者丁新田来信编辑同志：
    最近我读了三联书店一九五○年四月出版的千家驹先生著的《新财政学大纲》。这是一部财政学巨著，内容是解释财政理论并分析财政问题。我发现了一些问题，因为你们篇幅有限，我仅提出一个原则问题来作研究。
    当我读了该书农业税一节，在一六六页上发现有如下的文句：“但自经土地改革以后，地租已不复存在，租与赋已成一体，农民所交的公粮（即农业税）里面一部分，其实是过去的地租，一部分才是田粮。换句话说，过去农民是将这一部分交给地主的，现在因地主阶级的消灭，国家已取地主地位而代之，“公粮”就是地租加田赋之和……既然现在农业税是含有地租性质的田赋……”也许因为我理论水平的限制，不能深刻了解这段话的意思。我赞同千先生将田赋划归中央税收的财政理论，但是我认为在人民的政权下，不是国家已取地主地位而代之。“公粮就是地租田赋之和”的讲法对不对呢？关于田赋（农业税）正确的解释应如何？请转交千先生赐教，千先生的解答如能够在贵刊发表最好，这样对多数读者是有益的。
    丁新田
      作者千家驹复信新田先生：
    人民日报转来大函，敬悉。你指出了拙著新财政学大纲一六六页关于田赋与地租的解释，的确是大有语病的。我的意思本是说经过土地改革的地区，地租已不复存在，农民过去被迫缴纳地租的那一部分，现在可以不再受剥削，而仅仅负担有国家的公粮。因此在老解放区农民负担公粮虽相当的重，但农民生活却大大改善。但我在原著中竟加上“国家已取地主地位而代之，公粮就是地租加田赋之和”，这很容易使人误会到我们所实行的是资本主义国家的土地国有政策。这种说法是不对的。我应该改正，并且深深感谢你的指示。
    拙著是在国民党统治时代写的，其中难免有许多观点不正确或用辞不妥当的地方。最近我打算加以彻底修正，希望你多加指教。
    千家驹
