　　How to Avoid Electric Shock?
　　——Answering Comrade Gao Yong's Question

　　Editor Comrade:
　　Recently, there have been several cases of electric shock injuries in Beijing. For example: 1. The Xijiao New Urban Area automobile team was building a house between two utility poles of the Electric Power Bureau, and the roof was only one meter away from the low-voltage wires. At 10:45 AM on June 17th, the foreman accidentally grabbed the wire on the roof, burning both hands. 2. Wan Chenghao at No. 29 Guozi City Outer built a canopy in front of their door, and because it was too close to the wires, on the afternoon of June 16th, a worker named Dou Jiliang unfortunately touched the wire and was electrocuted, falling from the canopy and dying instantly. 3. The Sanitation Engineering Bureau was digging and repairing sewers in a vineyard, and the accumulated soil was higher than the houses after several days of work. At 11:00 AM on June 17th, a soil carrier inadvertently touched the service wire, and after several minutes, others used a wooden pole to break the wire. He died despite emergency treatment. 4. A soldier from the Liberation Army in Weijia Village went up the pole himself to repair the wires and died from electric shock when both hands touched the wire. How can electric shock be avoided? Please answer.

Comrade Gao Yong:
    The Beijing Electric Power Bureau has answered your question as follows:
    Beijing’s power transmission lines have two voltage levels: 77,000 volts and 33,000 volts. The city’s distribution lines have two voltage levels: 5,200 volts and 380 volts. The human body can conduct electricity, and it is easier to conduct electricity in the summer when sweating and barefoot. When housewives use electric irons to iron clothes in the summer, be sure not to wrap the extra-long cords around their arms. If the body touches a power source and can immediately break free, the part that was shocked will still be burned by the electric arc. If you grab the wire, the nerves in your hand will immediately lose sensation, making it impossible to break free. This is what people usually call being “sucked” by the electricity. If you touch a high-voltage power source, the person will be burned alive into coke by the strong current. If you touch a low-voltage power source, a few thousandths of an amp of current passing through the human body can paralyze the nervous system and stop the heart, leading to death. Don't underestimate the 380-volt and 220-volt low-voltage power sources. According to accident statistics in power plants, unfortunate incidents are often caused by low-voltage power sources.
    Recently, there have been many construction and canopy-building projects in the city, so special attention must be paid to whether there are any wires around that interfere with the work. If you find that the wires are obstructing the work, you can call the Beijing Electric Power Bureau's Line Section (3-4561 or 3-1731, 1736). If the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the suburbs need to connect to electricity, be sure to notify the bureau, and never try to connect to electricity yourself. In the event that someone is electrocuted, the first thing to note is that you must have sufficient insulation. Take a relatively long and dry wooden pole to first separate the electrocuted person’s contact point from the power source, and then drag the electrocuted person away and perform necessary first aid. Usually, the electrocuted person is only in a state of suspended animation due to paralysis of the nervous system. Seize the first few minutes to perform artificial respiration, which can revive them from suspended animation.

　　如何避免触电？
    ——答高永同志问编者同志：
    最近北京市曾发生了数起触电伤人事件，如：一、西郊新市区汽车队在电业局两个电线杆子之间盖房子，屋顶距离低压电线仅一公尺。六月十七日十时四十五分监工在房上误用手抓线，将两手烧伤。二、前外果子市二十九号万成号门前搭天棚，因距离电线太近，六月十六日下午，工人窦吉良不幸碰线触电，从天棚上摔下来，当即死亡。三、卫生工程局在葡萄园挖修下水道，工作数日，泥土堆积过房。六月十七日上午十一时，有一个挑土工人不慎触及接户线，数分钟后，旁人始用木杆将电线打断，经紧急救治无效身死。四、魏家村有一解放战军士，自己上杆修电线，两手触电身死。如何避免触电呢？请解答。
    高永高永同志：
    你的问题已经京市电业局答复如下：
    北京市的送电线路，有七七、○○○伏、三三、○○○伏两种电压；市内配电线路有五、二○○伏、三八○伏两种电压。人的身体可以传电，夏天出汗，光着脚，更容易传电。家庭主妇们夏天用电熨斗熨衣服时，千万别把过长的花线缠在手臂上。身体接触到电源，如果能够立即脱离，触电的部分也要受到电弧的灼伤；要是手抓住了电线，手部神经会顿时失去知觉，就会无法摆脱，这就是平常说的被电给吸住了。如果接触的是高电压的电源，人就会活活地被强烈电流烧成焦炭。要是接触的是低电压的电源，千分之几的安培电流经过人体，能够使人神经中枢麻痹，心脏停止活动，以致死亡。千万别看轻了三八○伏、二二○伏低电压的电源。据电厂里事故统计，不幸的事件常是低电压电源造成的。
    近来市上有不少盖房子、搭天棚的，一定要特别注意周围有无妨碍工作的电线。发现电线有碍工作时，可打电话给北京电业局线路股（三——四五六一或三——一七三一、一七三六）。解放军驻在市郊的部队，有关接电工作，一定要通知该局，千万不要自己轻易去接电。万一发现别人触电，这时先要注意到自己应有足够的绝缘，拿一根比较长而干燥的木杆，先把触电者触电部分与电源脱离，然后再把触电者拖开，施行必要的救治。通常触电者只不过是神经中枢麻痹假死，争取最初几分钟时间施行人工呼吸，仍能由假死而复活。
