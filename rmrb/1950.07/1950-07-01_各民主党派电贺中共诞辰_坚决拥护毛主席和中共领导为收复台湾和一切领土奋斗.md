[Report from this Newspaper] The democratic parties jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee, congratulating the Communist Party of China on its 29th anniversary. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

Chairman Mao and all members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

July 1st is the anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. This is a glorious anniversary in Chinese history, and it is also a glorious anniversary in the history of mankind. Today, we would like to extend our sincere and warm congratulations to you and the Communist Party of China.

Because of your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the great revolution of the Chinese people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has achieved such brilliant and great results today. Because of your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have been able to overthrow the tyrannical and brutal rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and establish their own people's regime. Because of your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have been able to end the century-long rule of imperialism over China, making China an independent and sovereign country. Because of your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our 475 million people today can be transformed from the oppressed to become masters of a new society and a new country, and achieve true liberation.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our new China has made unprecedented progress in just nine months. The liberation war in the mainland has basically ended. The state has a unified management and unified leadership system in finance and economy. The government has done a series of important work, including curbing inflation, stabilizing prices, providing disaster relief, relieving unemployment, and eliminating bandits and special agents. Now the people's democratic dictatorship regime is stable. This is an achievement welcomed and supported by all the Chinese people. We cannot but thank you and the Communist Party of China for your correct leadership.

China has established friendly diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries and has achieved friendly and mutually beneficial unity. This not only consolidates China's international position but also expands and strengthens the world's peace forces. This is an achievement welcomed and supported by the Chinese people. We cannot but thank you and the Communist Party of China for your correct leadership.

The Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has recently concluded successfully. At this meeting, the Communist Party of China put forward several important proposals for completing the revolution and launching construction, which have been unanimously approved by the conference. From today onwards, under the banner of your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of our country will sincerely and earnestly further launch many great revolutionary struggles on various fronts. We will fight to achieve a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation. We will fight to abolish the land ownership system of the landlord class and implement the land ownership system of the peasants. We will fight for the liberation of Tibet and Taiwan and to thoroughly ensure the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty. We firmly believe that with your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, all these struggles will surely achieve brilliant victories.

Today, as the Chinese people are wholeheartedly carrying out these revolutionary struggles vigorously, U.S. imperialism has openly mobilized its Seventh Fleet to carry out armed aggression against China, in order to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan and attempt to undermine the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. We, the Chinese people, absolutely cannot tolerate this crazy behavior of the U.S. imperialism, which disregards credibility, violates the law, and destroys peace. On this anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China, we are willing to swear sincerely and announce to the world that the Chinese people firmly support your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, unite as one, and fight together to achieve the goal of expelling U.S. imperialism and recovering Taiwan and all territories belonging to China. We offer this vow as a gift to celebrate the 29th anniversary of your party.

Respectfully wishing the Communist Party of China longevity!

　　各民主党派电贺中共诞辰
    坚决拥护毛主席和中共领导为收复台湾和一切领土奋斗
    【本报讯】各民主党派联名致电毛主席和中共中央，祝贺中国共产党成立二十九周年。贺电全文如下：毛主席暨中国共产党全体中委：
    七月一日是中国共产党建党的纪念日。这是中国历史上一个光荣的纪念日，这同时是世界人类历史上一个光荣的纪念日。在今天，我们谨向你和中国共产党致诚恳热烈的庆贺。
    因为有了你和中国共产党的领导，中国人民反帝反封建反官僚资本的大革命才有今天这样辉煌伟大的成果。因为有了你和中国共产党的领导，中国人民才能推翻国民党反动派专横残暴的统治，建立起人民自己的政权。因为有了你和中国共产党的领导，中国人民才能结束帝国主义百年来侵略中国的统治，使中国成为独立自主的国家。因为有了你和中国共产党的领导，我们四万七千五百万人民今天才能由被压迫的地位，成为新社会新国家的主人，而得到了真正翻身真正自由的解放。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，在短短九个月的时期中，我们的新中国又有了历史上空前的进步。国家在大陆上的解放战争已经基本的结束了。国家在财政经济上有了统一管理和统一领导的制度。政府做了制止通货膨胀，平定物价，救济灾荒，救济失业，肃清匪特一连串的重要工作。如今人民民主专政的政权已经稳固了。这是中国人民全体一致所欢迎所拥护的成绩。我们不能不感谢你和中国共产党领导的正确。
    中国与苏联和各新民主主义国家，建立了亲善的外交关系并且有了友好互助的团结。这不只巩固了中国的国际地位，而且扩大并增强了世界的和平力量。这是中国人民所欢迎所拥护的成绩。我们不能不感谢你和中国共产党领导的正确。
    最近中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议已经圆满闭幕了。在这次会议中，中国共产党又提出了几个完成革命开展建设的重要建议，这些建议已经为大会全体一致的通过了。从今天起，我们全国人民在你和中国共产党领导的旗帜下，又将诚心诚意进一步的在各个战线上开展许多伟大的革命斗争。我们要为争取财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争。我们要为废除地主阶级土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制而斗争。我们要为解放西藏台湾彻底保障中国领土与主权的完整而斗争。我们坚决相信，中国有了你和中国共产党的领导，这一切斗争，必定得到辉煌的胜利。
    今天当中国人民正在全心全力蓬蓬勃勃进行这些革命斗争的时候，美帝国主义竟公然动员他的第七舰队向中国进行武装侵略，以阻挠我们解放台湾，妄图破坏中国人民的革命事业。对美帝这种不顾信义，违背法律，破坏和平的疯狂行为，我们中国人民绝对不能忍受。我们愿在今天中国共产党诞生的纪念日，竭诚相誓，昭告天下，中国人民坚决拥护你和中国共产党的领导，万众一心，共同奋斗，以达到驱逐美帝，收复台湾和一切属于中国领土的目的。谨以这样一个誓愿，作为庆祝你的党第二十九次寿辰的礼物。
    敬祝中国共产党万岁！
