　　Land Reform Law Brings Prospects of Happiness
    Guanzhong Farmers Experience Infinite Joy
    (Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th) The vast number of farmers in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have expressed infinite joy after learning the content of the Land Reform Law. The blackboard newspaper run by the Wangqu District Office in Chang'an County published the full text of the Land Reform Law for three consecutive days. Farmers came from all directions, surrounded the blackboard newspaper, listened to others explain it, and eagerly spread the good news. Landlords in Zhuyuanfang and Getafang villages of the eighth district illegally sold nearly 70 mu of originally rented land this spring. Some poor peasants thought that the land they were entitled to would be "over" (meaning they would not be able to get it). Now that they have heard that the Land Reform Law clearly stipulates that such transfers are invalid, they happily said: "Chairman Mao thought it through carefully, the Land Reform Law is really good, and the landlords' speculation has failed." Zhao Yuxiu, an old poor peasant in Chengjiao Township, Xianyang County, said: "The old ways were too unfair! Poor people have labor but no land. Land reform is giving the poor people land, and we must work hard to produce!" After reading the Land Reform Law, middle peasants expressed that they would work hard to produce. Labor model and middle peasant Yan Baichuan said: "The Land Reform Law clearly states: 'Protect the land and property of middle peasants and rich middle peasants, and do not infringe on them.' This really puts the minds of middle peasants at ease. We must work even harder to do a good job in farming." Middle peasants in Wangqu District, Chang'an County, also expressed that they will unite with poor peasants like brothers in the land reform and work together to turn over. After reading the Land Reform Law, the rich peasants also dispelled their doubts. Gao Mengxian, a rich peasant in Gaojiawan Village, Wangqu District, said: "At the beginning of liberation, I heard that the land of rich peasants would be divided, and I was very worried and couldn't work hard in production. After the promulgation of this Land Reform Law, my doubts were dispelled. In the future, I must work hard, plow the land more, apply more fertilizer, and produce more grain." Wang Jinchang, the leader of the farmers' association in Chengjiao Township, Xianyang County, said to the farmers: "We must first rectify the farmers' association and not let bad elements mix in, so that we can do things fairly when we implement land reform this winter."

　　土改法带来幸福远景
    关中农民无限喜悦
    【新华社西安十四日电】陕西省关中地区的广大农民知道了土地改革法的内容后，都表示出无限的喜悦。长安县王曲区区公所办的黑板报，连续三天刊登土地改革法全文，农民们从四乡跑来，围着黑板报，听别人解说，并争相传告这一个喜讯。该区八乡竹园坊、圪塔坊等村地主，今春曾先后非法典卖了将近七十亩原先出租的土地，有些贫农以为应分的土地“瞎啦”（分不成的意思）。现在他们听到土地改革法上已明确地规定这样的转移分散一律无效，不由得欢喜地说：“毛主席想得细，土地改革法真个美，地主的投机取巧落空了。”咸阳县城郊乡老贫农赵玉秀说：“旧的世事太不公道啦！穷汉人都是有牙（劳力）没馍（土地），土地改革就是给穷人吃馍，咱们可要努力生产呀！”中农读了土地改革法后，都表示将努力生产。劳动模范中农阎百川说：“土地改革法上说得明明白白：‘保护中农及富裕中农的土地及其财产，不得侵犯’，这真使中农的心宽展了许多，我们一定要劲上加劲把庄稼做好。”长安县王曲区中农并表示将在土地改革中和贫农团结得象亲兄弟一样，同心协力闹翻身。富农看了土地改革法后，也都消除了疑虑。王曲区高家湾村富农高梦贤说：“解放初，我听说要分富农地，我心慌慌的，生产满不起劲。这次土地改革法公布后，我的疑虑才打消了，以后一定要勤劳生产，多锄地、上粪，多打粮食。”咸阳县城郊乡农会组长王金昌对农民群众说：“咱们先要把农会整顿好，不要使坏分子混进来，以便在今年冬天实行土地改革时，把事情办得公公道道。”
