The Truth About the Li Chengwan Gang's Launching of the Korean Civil War
    --Conversations with Captured Li Chengwan Puppet Troops
    The following are conversations with Army Lieutenant Han Ruihuan and Sergeant Park Huan Tae, belonging to the 17th Regiment of the Li Chengwan "National Defense Forces," who were captured by the Korean Democratic People's Republic Security Forces and People's Army on June 25th after participating in the adventurous attack on the area north of the 38th parallel. From the conversations of these two prisoners, it is not difficult to see the truth about the Li Chengwan gang launching the civil war under the instigation and direct command of the American imperialists and their tool of aggression, the "United Nations Commission on Korea."
    (1) The Adventurous Attack Was Launched Under the Secret Order of the Puppet "Army Headquarters"
    The following is the conversation of Army Lieutenant Han Ruihuan of the 17th Regiment Headquarters of the puppet army:
    Because I served as an operations instructor and political training officer at the 17th Regiment Headquarters of the "National Defense Forces," I know the inside story of this war very well. The first thing I want to say is that the launch of this war was by no means prepared in a day or two. Since May of last year, countless conflicts on the 38th parallel have been part of the "National Defense Forces'" war preparations. In May of this year, a meeting of division commanders of the entire "National Defense Forces" was held, and officers at the regimental commander level also attended. After detailed discussion, three plans for the operational plan to attack the area north of the 38th parallel were decided. After May, an order was issued to implement the "Army Headquarters' policy" -- a policy of unified leadership for the entire "National Defense Forces." According to this policy, we made full preparations for the offensive.
    Originally, the "National Defense Forces" on the 38th parallel rotated every six months, but this time, although the rotation time had passed for two months, the "Army Headquarters" still ordered us not to move. At the same time, communication with the "Army Headquarters" gradually became more frequent, and the "Headquarters" continued to inspect the front line.
    The 17th Regiment was stationed in Guangshan, one and a half kilometers north of Wengjin. The U.S. military advisory group sent Major Straki and seven other U.S. advisors to our regiment to direct us in forming a wartime system. The "Army Headquarters" instructed us: "We must completely occupy the area north of the 38th parallel and recover the lost land. In the past, Manchuria was also our territory, and even Manchuria should be recovered."
    Five or six days before the launch of the offensive, "United Nations military observers" came to our station to inspect and only returned to Seoul on the 23rd. The atmosphere on the front line suddenly became tense, and we had an unexpected feeling. The 24th was Saturday, and officers of the regiment headquarters could have gone out, but we received an order to stand by, prohibiting going out. That night, we spent the night in an unusually tense mood. The next morning, before dawn, the "Army Headquarters" finally issued a "top secret" order, ordering us to launch a full-scale offensive north of the 38th parallel.
    The units that started the offensive passed through the Wengjin front and advanced about one or two kilometers after breaking through the 38th parallel. The first battalion of the 17th Regiment attacked in the direction of Bicheng County and Qiaochuan, the third battalion advanced towards the Magpie Mountain area, and the second battalion temporarily served as a reserve battalion and was later assigned to the central line.
    Our offensive had not been going on for long when we encountered fierce counterattacks from the Republic Security Forces. About two kilometers north of the 38th parallel, we encountered stubborn resistance and counterattacks from the security forces. First, we received an urgent report from the third battalion in the Magpie Mountain area, and then the communication network on all lines was completely destroyed. The situation was already irreparably unfavorable to us.
    After the regimental commander received the urgent report from the battle of Magpie Mountain, he left without saying goodbye at 10:00 a.m. At this time, the regiment headquarters received intelligence that the first and third battalions in the central area were in a dangerous state, so communication between the units was completely cut off, and each company was disintegrating. Each squad and team was also in a state of chaos. The battalion in the Magpie Mountain area began to retreat to Luge Mountain, and the central area followed suit.
    The Republic Security Forces began to counterattack. We panicked and the officers and soldiers were in a mess. We initially thought our equipment was sophisticated and were very confident. But in the face of the power of the Republic Security Forces, this courage had disappeared. The 53 American rocket launchers of the 17th Regiment also had no effect. Before being assigned to Wengjin, the 17th Regiment was known as the most outstanding unit in the "National Defense Forces" and had served as the capital guards, protecting Li Chengwan. Under the propaganda of the "National Defense Headquarters," we always thought that occupying North Korea would be easy, but after launching the offensive, we realized our fragility.
    After arriving in Pyongyang, I learned that the "National Defense Forces" had already suffered a disastrous defeat on the 38th parallel. Today (the 28th), Seoul has also been liberated. We are guilty of unforgivable crimes before the motherland and the people, but the People's Army has given me a way out. On the way from the front line to Pyongyang, I was moved to tears several times by the various preferential treatments of the People's Army. I want to advise my former colleagues who are still fighting the People's Army to lay down their weapons immediately. Only in this way can a Korean walk the right path.
   (2) High Officials Slip Away, While Low-Ranking Soldiers Are in a Panic
    The following is the conversation of Sergeant Park Huan Tae, first squad of the twelfth company of the third battalion of the puppet army's 17th regiment:
    Our unit was stationed in the Magpie Mountain area of Wengjin and belonged to the second line. Early in the morning of the 25th, we suddenly received an emergency order to move out. At that time, I guessed that this move was to attack north of the 38th parallel, or to carry out the "Northern Expedition." I thought to myself that we would soon pass through Haeju and occupy Pyongyang. Because the officers of the 17th Regiment, including the regimental commander, often told us: we would be able to occupy Haeju in two hours, and after a few hours, we would be able to pass through Pyongyang and plant the Taegeukgi on Mount Baitou (Note: Mount Baitou is located on the border between North Korea and China).
    From May, we conducted combat training day and night. The American military officers who served as consultants to the regiment told us: with this level of training, there would be no problem in attacking North Korea. Before the offensive began, "United Nations military observers" frequently inspected our combat training. However, after the offensive began, due to the fierce counterattacks of the Republic Security Forces, our front-line troops were quickly annihilated, and the second line was in a dangerous state. The telecommunications network was also destroyed. The soldiers of the third battalion completely lost their morale, and the entire battalion was in chaos. The battalion commander, Major Wu Yixuan, and the company commander, Captain Zheng Jiwan, and other officers, were nowhere to be seen. The People's Army's counterattack became more and more fierce, and it was clear that our troops were about to be wiped out.
    Although we were often instructed that we must carry out the "Northern Expedition," we never understood why we should launch a civil war between fellow countrymen, nor did we understand for whom we were shedding blood. Most of the soldiers in our company had already deserted in a panic, and I myself wanted to run away to save my life. However, because the counterattacks of the People's Army and the security forces were like lightning, I and many other "National Defense Forces" soldiers were taken prisoner. At that time, I thought: "I will definitely be shot." Because our battalion commander, Wu Yixuan, told us when he started the attack to the north: "If you surrender or are captured, you will be shot on the spot." But after I was captured by the People's Army, I quickly realized that everything I had heard and learned in the "National Defense Forces" was false and deceptive. I now understand that the so-called "National Defense Forces" is nothing more than a tool for the Li Chengwan gang to sell the Korean people to the American imperialists as slaves and to instigate civil war and massacre the people.
    I deeply regret being deceived by the Li Chengwan gang and directly participating in the civil war to attack my fellow countrymen.

　　李承晚匪帮发动朝鲜内战真相
    ——被俘之李承晚伪军的谈话
    下面是六月二十五日参加冒险进攻三八线以北地区而被朝鲜民主主义人民共和国警备队与人民军俘虏的李承晚“国防军”第十七联队所属陆军中尉韩瑞焕和上士朴锾泰两人的谈话。从这两个俘虏的谈话中，不难看出李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义者及其侵略工具“联合国朝鲜委员会”的怂恿与直接指挥之下发动内战的真相。
    （一）冒险进攻是在伪“陆军本部”的密令下发动的伪军第十七联队本部陆军中尉韩瑞焕的谈话如下：
    我因在“国防军”第十七联队本部任作战教官兼政训军官，所以对这次战争的内幕知道得很清楚。我首先要说的，就是这次战争的发动，绝不是一两天内准备的。从去年五月以来，三八线上不胜枚举的冲突事件，都是属于“国防军”战争准备的一部分。今年五月间，曾召开全“国防军”的师团长会议，各联队长一级军官也都与会。经过详细讨论，决定了进攻三八线以北地区的作战计划的三个方案。五月以后，即下令实行“陆军本部的方针”——对全部“国防军”实行统一统率的方针。按照这一方针，我们做了全面进攻的准备。
    本来三八线的“国防军”每半年换防一次，但是这次换防时间虽已过了两个月，“陆军本部”却仍命令我们不要移动。同时，与“陆军本部”的来往也逐渐频繁，“本部”并不断地视察第一线。
    十七联队驻屯在瓮津以北一公里半的光山，美国军事顾问团派遣斯特拉基少校等七个美国顾问到我们联队，指挥我们编成战时体制。“陆军本部”给我们指示说：“我们要完全占领三八线以北地区，收复失地。过去满洲也曾是我们的领土，连满洲也应该收复”。
    发动进攻前五、六天，“联合国军事监视员”到我们的驻地视察，二十三日才回汉城。第一线的气氛突然紧张起来，我们有着意外的感觉。二十四日是星期六，联队本部的军官本来可以外出，但我们接到待机的命令，禁止外出。当晚以异常紧张的心情度过了一夜。第二天清早天还没亮，“陆军本部”终于下了“极密”的命令，命令我们向三八线以北全面进攻。
    开始进攻的各部队，经过瓮津战线，突破三八线大约前进了一两公里的样子。第十七联队第一大队向碧城县、茄川方面进击，第三大队向喜鹊山地带前进，第二大队暂充预备大队，后来被分配在中央线。
    我们的进攻开始不久，就遭到共和国警备队的猛烈反击。在三八线以北约二公里的地点，遇到警备队的顽强抵抗和反击。首先接到喜鹊山方面第三大队的急报，后来各线联络网随即全遭破坏，情况对我们的不利已经达到不可收拾的境地。
    联队长接到喜鹊山战斗的急报后，上午十时即不辞而别。这时联队本部又接到中部地带的第一、第三两大队已陷于危险状态的情报，于是部队间的联络完全断绝，各中队（连）已呈土崩瓦解之势，各小队（排）、分队（班）也陷于混乱状态。喜鹊山方面的大队开始向绿葛山退却，中部地带也随之退却。
    共和国警备队开始反攻了。我们惊慌失措，官兵乱作一团。我们起初以为自己的装备精锐，很有自信。但在共和国警备队的武力面前，这些勇气已不知去向。十七联队的五十三门美国火箭炮也没起作用。十七联队在未分配到瓮津以前，在“国防军”内号称最优秀的部队，曾做过首都警卫队，保护过李承晚。在“国防本部”的宣传之下，我们向来以为占领北朝鲜是轻而易举的事，但是发动进攻之后，才知道我们的脆弱。
    来到平壤后，知道“国防军”在三八线早已惨败。今天（二十八日）汉城也解放了。我们在祖国与人民面前是罪不容诛的，但是人民军却给了我一条生路。我在从前线到平壤的途中，曾因人民军的种种优厚待遇，感动得流过好几次眼泪。我要劝告目前尚在与人民军作战的过去同僚，立刻放下武器。唯有这样才是一个朝鲜人所应走的道路。
   （二）大官溜之乎也，小兵心乱如麻
    伪军第十七联队第三大队第十二中队第一小队上士朴锾泰的谈话如下：
    我们的部队驻在瓮津喜鹊山方面，属于第二线。二十五日清早，我们突然接到紧急命令，叫我们出动。当时我就猜到这一出动就是要进攻三八线以北，或者说要进行“北伐”了。我心想，不久就会路过海州，占领平壤。因为十七联队联队长以下的官儿们，常常告诉我们说：两个钟头就能够占领海州，几小时后就能经过平壤，把太极旗插到白头山（按白头山位于朝鲜北端与中国交界线上）。
    我们从五月起，不分昼夜地进行了战斗训练，联队的顾问美军军官们对我们说：训练到这种程度，进攻北朝鲜是毫无问题的了。在没有进攻以前，“联合国军事监视员”经常检阅我们的战斗训练。但是进攻开始以后，由于共和国警备队的猛烈反击，我们的第一线部队很快地就被消灭，第二线随即处于危险状态，电信电话联络网也被破坏了。第三大队的士兵完全丧失了士气，整个大队顿时混乱起来。大队长吴益铉少校和中队长郑基完上尉等官儿们，连影子也看不见了。人民军的反攻愈来愈猛，很明显地我们的部队就要被歼了。
    我们虽然经常受到训示说：一定要举行“北伐”，但是始终也不了解为什么要发动同族内战，也不明白为谁流血。我们中队里的士兵大部已狼狈地开了小差，我自己也想为保存性命而逃跑。但是由于人民军和警备队的反攻像闪电一般，我和其他许多“国防军”士兵一起做了俘虏。当时我想：“一定被枪毙”。因为我们的大队长吴益铉在开始向北部进攻时曾对我们说：“如果你们投降，或是被俘，当场就会被人枪毙”。但是我被人民军俘虏后就很快地发觉，原来我在“国防军”内所听的、所学的一切，都是虚伪与欺骗。我现在才明白所谓“国防军”，不过是李承晚匪帮为将朝鲜人民出卖给美帝国主义者做奴隶和挑拨内战屠杀人民的工具。
    我深深地懊悔被李承晚匪帮所欺骗，并直接参加了进攻同族的内战。
