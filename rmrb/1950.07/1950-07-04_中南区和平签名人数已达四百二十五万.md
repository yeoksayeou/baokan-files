Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 3rd: The peace signature campaign in Central and Southern China has been widely launched from cities to villages. According to incomplete statistics from the six provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, by the end of June, the number of signatures in major cities and rural areas of the provinces had reached 4,256,000. Among them, Hunan Province has more than 1.2 million people, Guangdong Province has more than 988,900 people, Wuhan City has nearly 1 million people, and Guangzhou City has 540,965 people.

The peace signature campaign in various provinces first started in major towns and cities, and then, through newspapers, radio stations, schools, and people's organizations, promoted or explained the campaign to the vast rural areas in various ways, so that the movement quickly expanded to rural areas and unorganized citizens. In Yidu County, Hubei Province, more than 1,500 workers and students organized an amateur propaganda team in early June. After publicizing the significance of peace signatures to citizens and farmers, more than 20,000 people signed in one day. After Hunan Province launched a peace signature campaign at the provincial peasant representative conference, the movement immediately developed to the countryside through peasant representatives. In Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, more than 12,000 people out of 15,000 in four townships signed their names. Of the 66,700 people who signed in the Xingmei Special District, farmers accounted for 43 percent.

At present, in response to the call of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all localities will further expand the peace signature campaign.

　　中南区和平签名人数已达四百二十五万
    【本报讯】据新华社汉口三日电：中南区和平签名运动从城市到乡村普遍展开。据豫、鄂、湘、赣、粤、桂六省的不完全统计，至六月底止，各省主要城市和农村的签名人数已达四百二十五万六千余人。其中湖南省有一百二十余万人，广东省有九十八万八千九百余人，武汉市将近一百万人，广州市五十四万零九百六十五人。
    各省的和平签名运动首先在主要城镇进行，然后通过报纸、广播台、学校和人民团体等，以各种方式向广大农村进行宣传或解释，使运动迅速扩展到农村和无组织的市民中去。湖北省宜都县一千五百多工人和学生，在六月初组织了业余宣传队，向市民和农民宣传了和平签名的意义后，一天中即有两万多人签名。湖南省在该省正在举行的农民代表大会上发起了和平签名后，运动随即通过农民代表向乡村发展。广东省新会县四个乡一万五千余人中有一万二千多人签了名，兴梅专区签名的六万六千七百多人中，农民占百分之四十三。
    目前各地为响应人民政协全国委员会的号召，将更进一步展开和平签名运动。
