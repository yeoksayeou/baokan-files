　　Achieve a Comprehensive Reform of Coal Mining Methods
　　The fundamental problem facing China's coal mining industry today is how to improve coal mining methods.

　　In old China, the coal mining industry, like the entire nation, fundamentally did not belong to the people, needless to say. Just in terms of coal mining methods, the situation then was extremely dire. Due to the adoption of backward coal mining methods such as high-fall and square-pillar methods, China's coal mining industry had two serious, unresolved fundamental problems for a long time: first, the severe depletion of coal mine resources; second, the serious casualties among workers. In terms of resource loss rates, only 30 percent could be extracted from thick coal seams (thick coal seams account for 80 percent of all reserves in Chinese coal mines), with a loss rate of over 70 percent. The number of water and fire disasters was even more alarming. For example, in 1935, the Hongshan No. 1 Mine in Shandong was flooded, drowning 800 people; in 1939, the Jingxing North Mine coal dust explosion killed 343 people; in 1943, the Benxi Daxie Mine gas explosion in Northeast China killed 1,600 people. These were all the results of the imperialist and bureaucratic capital's policy of plundering national resources. They only cared about mining coal and did not care about the lives of the workers. Furthermore, production in the coal mining industry was extremely dispersed. Most mines were temporary small inclined shafts, which also caused serious waste of coal mine resources.

　　Since liberation, China's coal mines have been transferred to the hands of the people's state. The miners who were treated like animals in the past have now become the masters of the mines. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the miners have worked hard to restore 249 state-owned mines in Northeast, North, East, and Central South China, accounting for 80 percent of state-owned mines. The number of employees has reached more than 200,000. The daily output of state-owned mines alone has now reached more than 80,000 tons. Production efficiency has generally increased by 70 to 150 percent. Coal mining technology and safety work have been improved to some extent. Many outstanding workers have been trained and promoted to leadership positions. Many mining areas have established the view of relying on the working class to improve production in their guiding ideology. Cadres have also made great progress in their technical and professional studies. All of these have created conditions for improving the coal mining industry.

　　However, the two most fundamental problems in coal mine production—improving recovery rates and safe production—have not been well resolved. Most coal mines have only made some improvements based on the old coal mining methods, and have not carried out thorough reforms by adopting advanced technologies. Therefore, the loss of coal mine resources is still around 70 percent; worker casualties are still quite serious.

　　Why can such a serious situation continue to exist in the new China's coal mines?

　　This is because many of our coal mine staff blindly continue the old coal mining methods and management concepts under the rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. They do not understand or believe in the new coal mining methods suggested by Soviet experts based on the specific conditions of Chinese coal mines at the National Coal Mine Conference last November; or although they believe in these new coal mining methods, they do not have the courage to overcome the difficulties encountered in improving production. Coal mining methods are the central issue of mine operations, and are the key to determining the success or failure of coal mine work. If this central link cannot be grasped, it is impossible to do a good job in coal mine work.

　　After the National Coal Mine Conference last November proposed learning advanced Soviet technology and improving coal mining methods, the Hegang and Xi'an mines in Northeast China, the Tongshun Mine in Fengfeng, North China, and the Huainan Mine in East China changed their old coal mining methods and adopted new coal mining methods such as three-section longwall and gangue filling, which achieved great results. In terms of recovery rates, the general recovery rate of the 6-meter thick coal seam in Hegang has increased from 30 percent to 60 to 80 percent. The 10-meter thick coal seam in the Xi'an Mine in Northeast China has increased from 34 percent in the past to 80 to 90 percent. The Tongshun Mine in Fengfeng, North China, has increased from 50 percent to 85 to 90 percent. According to the current coal mining rate, the life of the mine has been doubled, greatly saving the country's coal mine resources. In terms of casualties, since the Hegang Mine began using new coal mining methods last November, there have only been minor injuries at the beginning, and no casualties have occurred in the past six months. This is the beginning of a great victory on the new democratic coal mining industry production front.

　　Coal miners are active supporters of new coal mining methods because this is not only in line with the long-term interests of coal miners, but also more in line with their current interests. However, some coal mine work cadres have strong conservative ideas in the reform of coal mining methods. On the one hand, it is the result of some coal mine staff blindly worshiping the "scientific level" of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism; on the other hand, it is because some coal mine staff do not understand new technologies, and therefore fear reform, and do not realize that reforming coal mining methods is to change the basic links in the existing coal mine work. These ideas should be overcome and can be completely overcome. The remnants of the idea of ​​blindly worshiping imperialism have reached the point where they should be thoroughly reformed. Soviet scientific experience not only has undeniable successful examples in the Soviet Union, but has also been proven successful thousands of times in the new China's industry. That is, in the Chinese coal mining industry, it has also achieved well-known results. Slightly conscious coal mine staff should no longer have any nostalgia for the coal mining methods of imperialists based on the policy of plunder. As for not knowing new methods, there is no need to be timid. As long as you learn humbly and resolutely, you can gradually learn. The iron-like facts before us are: the two problems that could not be solved in the past coal mining industry—safe production and reasonable recovery rates—have begun to be solved after adopting new methods. Although this is only the beginning, it is a very meaningful beginning.

　　The comprehensive reform of coal mining methods is a historic turning point for making semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese coal mines into new democratic coal mining industries. The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central Government convened a meeting of responsible cadres of the major administrative regions' coal mine management bureaus in May this year, and decided to gradually complete the preparation for new coal mining methods in the second half of 1950; in the mines that have been reformed, they will be further improved to obtain rich experience, lay the foundation for the reform of most mines nationwide in 1951, and open up a broad road for the complete mechanization of China's coal mine production process and the improvement of miners' working conditions. Of course, in this transformation process, you may encounter various difficulties and ideological resistance. But as long as you deeply lead, patiently unite the staff, rely on the masses, and resolutely accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, all difficulties can be overcome.

### 实现采煤方法的全面改革

　　实现采煤方法的全面改革
    中国煤矿工业目前的基本问题，是如何改进采煤方法的问题。
    在旧中国，煤矿工业和整个国家的性质一样，根本不是属于人民的，那就不用说了。单就采煤方法来说，那时的情况是十分恶劣的。由于采取高落式与方柱式等落后的采煤方法，使中国煤矿工业中长期存在着两个严重的未曾解决的基本问题：第一是煤矿资源的严重损耗；第二是工人的严重伤亡。以资源损失率来说，在厚煤层（中国煤矿中厚煤层占全部储量的百分之八十）中只能采出百分之三十，损失率在百分之七十以上。水火等灾害事故之多，更是惊人。例如一九三五年山东洪山第一矿透水淹死八百人；一九三九年井陉北矿煤尘爆炸死三四三人；一九四三年东北本溪大斜井瓦斯爆炸死一千六百人。这些都是帝国主义与官僚资本对于国家资源实行掠夺政策的结果。他们只顾采煤，不管工人的死活。其次，煤矿工业中生产是极端分散的。矿井多为临时性的小斜井，对于煤矿资源也造成了严重的浪费。
    解放以后，中国煤矿已经转到人民国家的手里。过去遭受牛马待遇的矿工，今天已成为矿山的主人。在人民政府领导下，矿工们努力修复了东北、华北、华东和中南等地的国营矿井二四九个，占国营矿井的百分之八十。职工人数达到二十万人以上。仅国营各矿的日产量现已达到八万吨以上。生产效率一般地提高了百分之七十至百分之一百五十。采煤技术和保安工作有了某些改进。许多优秀的工人，被培养并已被提拔到领导岗位上来。不少矿区在领导思想上树立了依靠工人阶级搞好生产的观点。干部的技术与业务学习也有很大的进步。所有这些，均为改进煤矿工业创造了条件。
    但是煤矿生产中最根本的两大问题——提高回收率和安全生产问题仍未很好解决。多数煤矿仅在旧的采煤方法的基础上作了某些改进，还没有从采用进步技术方面进行彻底改革。因此煤矿资源的损失还在百分之七十左右；矿工伤亡事件仍是相当严重。
    这样严重情况为什么还能在新中国煤矿中继续存在呢？
    这是由于我们许多煤矿工作人员盲目地继续了帝国主义与官僚资本主义统治下旧的采煤方法与经营观点的结果。他们不了解或不相信去年十一月全国煤矿会议上根据苏联专家依照中国煤矿具体情况所建议的新的采煤方法；或者虽然相信这种新的采煤方法，而没有勇气去克服改进生产中所遇到的困难。采煤方法是矿井作业的中心问题，是决定煤矿工作成败的关键，对于这一中心环节如果不能掌握，要想搞好煤矿工作是不可能的。
    去年十一月全国煤矿会议提出学习苏联先进技术，改进采煤方法之后，东北鹤岗、西安，华北峰峰通顺井，华东淮南等煤矿改变了旧的采煤方法，采用了三段长壁，矸石充填等新的采煤方法，收到了很大的效果。以回收率来说，鹤岗六公尺的厚煤层一般的回收率已由百分之三十提高至百分之六十到八十。东北西安矿十公尺厚煤层，已由过去百分之三十四提高达百分之八十至九十。华北峰峰通顺井已由百分之五十提高至百分之八十五至九十。照现有的采煤率来说，矿山寿命延长了一倍，大大节约了国家的煤矿资源。而在伤亡方面，鹤岗矿自去年十一月开始新采煤方法以来，仅在开始时有过轻伤，半年来一直未发生过伤亡事故。这是新民主主义煤矿工业生产战线上一个伟大胜利的开端。
    煤矿工人是新采煤方法的积极支持者，因为，这不但符合于煤矿工人的长远利益，也更符合于目前的利益。但某些煤矿工作干部在采煤方法的改革上，存在有浓厚的保守思想。一方面是某些煤矿工作人员盲目崇拜帝国主义和官僚资本主义的“科学水平”的结果，另一方面则是某些煤矿工作人员不懂得新技术，因而惧怕改革，没有认识到改革采煤方法是改变现有煤矿工作中的基本环节。这些思想是应当加以克服而且完全可以克服的。盲目崇拜帝国主义的思想的残余，已经到了应当彻底改革的时候了。苏联的科学经验，不仅在苏联已有无可争辩的成功的实例，在新中国工业中也得到了千百次成功的证明，即在中国煤矿工业中，也已得到了众所周知的成绩。稍有觉悟的煤矿工作人员不应当对于帝国主义者基于掠夺政策的采煤方法再有什么留恋了。至于不会新的方法，也用不着胆怯，只要虚心地坚决地学习是可以逐步学会的。摆在我们面前的铁一般的事实是：过去煤矿工业中不能解决的两个问题——安全生产和合理的回收率，在采用新方法后，已开始解决了。这虽仅仅是开始，但这是很有意义的开始。
    采煤方法的全面改革，是使半封建、半殖民地性的中国煤矿，成为新民主主义煤矿工业的一个历史性的转折点。中央燃料工业部在今年五月召集的各主要行政区煤矿管理局负责干部会议，已决定在一九五○年下半年内逐步完成新采煤方法的准备工作；在已进行改革的矿井，则将进一步提高，以取得丰富的经验，打下一九五一年在全国范围内大部矿井进行改革的基础，为中国煤矿生产过程的全部机械化和改善矿工的劳动条件，开辟一条坦阔的道路。当然在这一转变过程中，可能遇到各式各样的困难和思想抵抗。但只要深入领导，耐心地团结职工，依靠群众，并坚决地接受苏联的先进经验，则一切困难都是可以克服的。
