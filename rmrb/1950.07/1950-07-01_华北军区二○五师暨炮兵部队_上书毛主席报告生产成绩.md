　　North China Military Region 205th Division and Artillery Units
	Report Production Achievements to Chairman Mao

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The entire officers and soldiers of the 205th Division directly under the North China Military Region wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on their production situation as a gift for the "July 1st" anniversary. The original letter is as follows:

	Dear Chairman Mao:

	As the 29th anniversary of the Party's founding on "July 1st" arrives, all the officers and soldiers of our division wish to report our production situation to you as a gift.

	In December of last year, when you issued the production instructions for 1950, we organized study sessions and further realized that the People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting force but should also become a production army. We see participating in production as one of the major tasks in building our country.

	On March 26th of this year, we arrived at the production area – the Chaobai River bank between Beijing and Tianjin. This is a heavily disaster-stricken area. Seeing the people lacking food and clothing, although it is a temporary difficulty, it educated us and made us deeply realize that only by accelerating national production and construction can the people live happy lives.

	We started work on April 2nd. Due to lack of experience, we did not achieve significant results after two days. At this time, some comrades became anxious, saying, when will such a large project be completed! However, when we thought of the Party and thought of you, we had courage and felt that no difficulty could not be overcome in front of us! We calculated and understood: the soil transportation distance initially was eighty meters, but later it could be reduced to ten meters; the higher the embankment, the narrower it is, the less soil is needed; the stronger the body becomes through exercise, the more strength we have... From then on, everyone's morale was high. Although our shoulders were swollen, our backs ached, and our palms were burned, everyone's attitude was: let it press! Let it grind! Grit your teeth and grit your teeth again! Grind out a good ideology, press out a good physique! Many female comrades felt that carrying soil with two people was not enough and asked to carry one load each to compete with the male comrades.

	At this time, the division proposed: enthusiasm alone is not enough; we must use our brains, plan carefully, promote creativity, improve technology, and strive for production victory with the combination of physical and mental strength. From the second week onwards, there were significant improvements in ramming, soil transportation, and construction organization. The large embankment on the river beach gradually grew taller and taller.

	At the beginning, we spread the soil too thickly in some places, and the ramming was not solid enough. After the comrades from the Water Conservancy Bureau gave instructions, we quickly corrected it, and in the end, we received twelve award banners from the Water Conservancy Bureau. We promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and love. No matter who, which team, or which platoon, everyone could help each other. When production was nearing completion, unity and mutual assistance simply became a movement. No matter who or which unit, as soon as they completed their task, they immediately went to help others work. Under such circumstances, the three-month production task was completed in two and a half months, transporting 1.03 million cubic meters of soil to both sides of the river and building a large embankment 27 li long and 5 meters high.

	A few days ago, we heard from the higher authorities that you, dear Chairman Mao, called on the People's Liberation Army, especially cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, to strengthen cultural learning. The higher authorities also told us that the soldiers' cultural level should reach elementary school graduation level within two or three years, and the cadres' level should reach middle school graduation level within three to five years, turning our old roughnecks from worker and peasant backgrounds into new-type intellectuals with culture and education. How happy we are to hear that! Now we are all considering: after the production dividends are distributed, we will buy more learning tools, resolutely respond to your call, and strive to improve our cultural level and build a modern national defense army. We firmly believe that we will definitely achieve new victories in cultural learning in the coming years, just like we completed combat missions and this dike construction task in the past. We will also be able to defend our sacred people's motherland and crush any imperialist aggression!

	Long live our sacred motherland!

	Long live the Communist Party of China!

	Long live our beloved and great people's leader Chairman Mao!

	Sincerely wish
	You, Chairman Mao, our beloved leader, good health!

	Salute from all the officers and soldiers of the 205th Division directly under the North China Military Region
	June 29th

Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: The entire Communist Party members, production heroes, model workers, and all officers and soldiers of the artillery units of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting that they have built a 6,700-meter-long dike on the Chaobai River to welcome the great festival of the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on July 1st.

The letter reported the process of their constructing the Chaobai River dike, saying: "The Chaobai River is a large river that has flooded for many years. Last year's flood alone destroyed more than 1,900 villages. This time, together with our brother units and civilian laborers, we built a solid levee on both banks to prevent it from endangering the people on both sides. We organized a dike-building team of more than 4,400 people, set off to the Chaobai River bank on March 29th, and started work at dawn on April 5th. At the beginning, our shoulders were swollen, and we broke countless carrying poles. From morning to night, we were exposed to the wind and sun, and almost every day we carried soil back and forth for forty or fifty li. But we finally overcame all difficulties and completed the dike, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of June, more than twenty days ahead of schedule on June 4th. In these sixty-one days, we excavated more than 395,000 cubic meters of earth and built a dike 4.2 meters high, 25 meters wide at the base, and 6,785 meters long."

The letter said: "In production, we adhered to what you have always taught us, cared for and helped the masses. Every day after work, we carried water and did chores for the masses, publicized the Party's policies to them, and established close relationships with the masses, raising their awareness. They deeply realized that we are their own army. Some people took advantage of our going to work and took apart and washed our quilts. When we returned after completing our tasks, they reluctantly saw us off for a long distance. After we returned to our garrison, we received many letters from them."

The letter reported their health conditions, saying: "After the exercise of labor, our skin has been tanned by the sun, our arms and legs have become stronger, and our bodies have become healthier."

The letter concluded: "On June 16th, we held a production summary and commendation conference to reward 111 first-class models. At the meeting, we deeply felt that it is extremely glorious to be a soldier in the army led by you. In the past, you led us to defeat the Kuomintang reactionary army armed by American imperialism. Today, you are leading us to win the first great victory on the production front. These honors are all given to us by you. Therefore, the greatest glory should go to you—our most beloved Chairman Mao."

　　华北军区二○五师暨炮兵部队
    上书毛主席报告生产成绩
    【本报讯】华北军区直属二○五师全体指战员写信给毛主席，报告生产情形，作为“七一”的献礼。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    “七一”党的二十九周年生日到了，我们全师指战员愿把我们的生产情形报告给你，作为献礼。
    在去年十二月，你发出一九五○年生产指示时，我们曾组织了学习，进一步认识了人民解放军不仅是一支战斗队，而且还应该成为一支生产军。我们参加生产看做是建设我们国家的重大任务之一。
    今年三月二十六日，我们开到生产地区——京津之间潮白河畔。这是重灾区，我们看到人民缺吃少穿，虽然是暂时的困难，却教育了我们，使我们深刻体会到只有加速全国生产建设，才能使人民过幸福的日子。
    我们四月二日开工，因为缺乏经验，两天后没有显著成绩。这时有些同志着急了，说这么大的工程，啥时才能完成哩！可是，当我们想起党，想起你，就有了勇气，觉得任何困难在我们面前没有不能排除的！我们计算了一下，弄明白了：运土距离开始八十公尺，以后可以缩到十公尺；筑堤越高越窄，需要土量越少；身体越练越强，越有力气……。从此，大家情绪高涨了，虽然肩肿了，腰痛了，手掌磨得像火烧，可是大家的态度是：叫它压吧！叫它磨吧！咬牙再咬牙！磨出一个好思想，压出一个好体格！许多女同志都嫌两个人抬土不过瘾，要求一人一担和男同志们比。
    这时，师里提出了：光热情还不够，必须开动脑筋，精心计划，发扬创造，改进技术，用体力和智力的结合争取生产胜利。从第二周起，不论行夯、运土、施工组织等都有了显著的改进，河滩上的大堤逐渐长起来高起来了。
    开始我们个别地方铺土过厚，行夯不够结实，经水利局同志指示后，很快纠正了，末了还得到水利局十二面奖旗。我们发扬了互助友爱精神，不管那个人，那个班，那个排，都能你帮我，我帮你。生产将近结束时，团结互助简直成了一个运动，不论那个人那个单位，只要自己一完工，就立刻帮助别人去工作。就在这种情形下，三个月的生产任务两个半月完成了，把一百零三万方土运到河身两旁，筑成了长二十七华里，高五公尺的大堤。
    前几天听到上级说，你，亲爱的毛主席，号召人民解放军特别是工农出身的干部要加强文化学习。上级又告诉我们，战士的文化两三年内达到小学毕业程度，干部三五年内达到中学毕业程度，把我们工农出身的老粗变成有文化教养的新型知识分子。我们听了多么高兴呵！现在我们都在考虑着：等生产分了红，再多买些学习用具，坚决响应你的号召，为提高自己的文化水平和建设现代国防军而努力。我们坚决相信，一定像过去完成战斗任务和这次完成筑堤任务那样，在今后数年内取得文化学习的新胜利。我们也一定能够保卫我们神圣的人民祖国，粉碎任何帝国主义的侵略！
    我们神圣的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我们敬爱的伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    谨祝
    你，毛主席，我们敬爱的领袖健康！
    华北军区直属二○五师全体指战员敬礼
    六月二十九日
    【新华社三十日讯】人民解放军华北军区炮兵部队的全体共产党员、生产中的英雄模范和全体指战员写信给毛主席，报告他们已筑成了长六千七百多公尺的潮白河大堤，来迎接七月一日中国共产党诞生二十九周年的伟大节日。
    信中报告他们修筑潮白河堤的经过说：“潮白河是一条连年泛滥的大河，仅去年一次水灾就冲毁了一千九百多个村庄。这次我们和兄弟部队及民工们在一起，在两岸修建了坚实的长堤，使它不再危害两岸的人民。我们组织了四千四百多人的筑堤队，于三月二十九日出发到潮白河岸，四月五日黎明开始动工。开始，我们的肩膀都压肿了，扁担也不知压断了多少，从早到晚，风吹日晒，差不多每天担着土来回要走四、五十里路。但是我们终于克服了一切困难，在六月四日把预定到六月底筑好的大堤，提前二十多天完成了。在这六十一天里，我们共挖了三十九万五千多公方土，筑成了高四公尺二、底宽二十五公尺、长六千七百八十五公尺的大堤。”
    信中说：“在生产中，我们本着你一贯教导我们的，爱护和帮助了群众。每天收工回来我们给群众担水、干活，向他们宣传党的政策，和群众建立了密切的关系，提高了他们的觉悟。他们深切地了解到我们是他们自己的军队。有的趁着我们去上工，就把我们的被子拆洗了。在我们完成任务回来时，他们都恋恋不舍地送出很远。我们回到驻地后，还接到他们不少的来信。”
    信中报告他们的健康情况说：“经过了劳动的锻炼，我们的皮肤被太阳晒黑了，胳膊、腿更强劲了，身体也更加健壮了。”
    信中最后说：“六月十六日，我们召开了生产总结奖模大会，奖励了一百一十一名甲等模范。在会上，我们深深感觉到：作为你所领导的军队中的一个战士，是再光荣不过了。过去你领导我们打败了美帝国主义所武装的国民党反动军队，今天你又领导我们在生产战线上打了第一个大胜仗。这些光荣都是你给我们的。因此，最大的光荣应该归于你——我们最敬爱的毛主席。”
