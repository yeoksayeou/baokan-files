　　Traditional Chinese Medicine Must Embark on the Path of Science
　　Pan Zhaopeng
　　At the upcoming First National Health Conference, representatives of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) from various regions will also participate to jointly discuss and study how to strive for the health cause of the Chinese people.

　　The Central People's Government cares about TCM. It has strived to cherish, support, and improve them, uniting the strength of TCM and giving play to their spirit of serving the people. In April of this year, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued instructions to health agencies at all levels across the country—to earnestly do a good job in uniting TCM practitioners. Everyone can recall that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, among their tens of thousands of orders, what was there regarding TCM issues besides promulgating regulations and rules restricting them?

　　I qualified as a TCM practitioner in 1927 and have been practicing for twenty years. When I studied medicine, I did so because of limitations in my personal circumstances. In the past, studying medicine was very difficult. Only after graduating from elementary school and being admitted to middle school, and graduating from middle school, could one apply to medical university. And how many new students could medical universities enroll each year? We know that sometimes there were seven or eight hundred applicants, but only forty were admitted. Therefore, many middle school graduates who wanted to study medicine at medical university were restricted. At the same time, in that kind of society in the past, people were very poor. How many could graduate from middle school? Even if you aspired to study medicine, you often could not fulfill your wishes.

　　Many of those who studied TCM were probably subjected to the rule and restrictions of the reactionaries, falling into a state of cultural backwardness.

　　Although I studied TCM according to a certain procedure, reading books and assisting in diagnoses, there were many things I didn't understand clearly. Let me give an example from past research to illustrate: "Pulse Diagnosis" is an indispensable part of TCM diagnosis. But if we pursue the origin of the pulse, the books on pulse diagnosis in TCM tell us: "In the twelve meridians, all have arteries, only the cun kou is taken to determine a person's life, death, and fortune." "Blood vessels are like rings without end." In general terms, this makes some sense. But why does the pulse beat? In Li Shizhen's "Four-Character Essentials," it says: "The pulse is the blood vessel, the precursor of qi and blood; the channel of blood, where breath and qi respond!"

　　We cannot find a very specific and clear answer from TCM books regarding the origin of the pulse and the beating of the pulse. If we want to delve into this issue, we cannot but explore scientific medicine to understand the relationship between the heart and blood pressure, to understand the difference between arteries and veins, and to understand the condition of the systemic circulation.

　　I personally have a few opinions on TCM academics, which I would like to contribute for your reference.

　　(1) Learning new science on the basis of old experience. In countless conscious or unconscious attempts over thousands of years, TCM has naturally accumulated many medical principles and experiences, but it also contains many anti-scientific elements. Therefore, accepting scientific truth is necessary: on the one hand, to break its unique metaphysical speculation; on the other hand, to accept new medical knowledge to enrich and improve it.

　　So we should learn. Of course, we won't know if we don't learn. We should follow the instructions given to us by Vice Minister He Cheng of the Central Ministry of Health at the founding meeting of the Beijing TCM Association:

　　"The issue of advanced studies and improvement for TCM is to learn a new technology. First of all, we must eliminate sectarian prejudices and learn with an open mind. In the future, TCM may obtain some good conditions for improvement, and TCM should make good use of these conditions, coupled with the many experiences of TCM itself, will make themselves more substantial, which is the future of TCM development."

　　(2) Organize TCM medicine and promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts. It is undeniable that some of the content of TCM academics contains valuable aspects. If we want to pursue this medical value, we need to organize the old medicine properly. We must take an objective and scientific attitude and promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts. For example: "Wind" is the cause of all diseases. Is "wind" really something that exists? "Wind is the external cause of stroke and paralysis." Today, is it still acceptable to use the word "wind" to explain all causes of disease? Don't misread the problem, and don't see the problem as similar and vague.

　　(3) Should accept criticism. Not afraid of criticism, only through criticism can we progress and develop. When criticizing, pay attention to using actual examples for comparison and contrast, discover where there are errors, and research the correct conclusions. Science progresses through continuous criticism.

　　Is it better to read books from thousands of years ago now, or is it better to read current books? What are the different results of reading current books versus books from thousands of years ago? What will happen if you only read books from thousands of years ago and don't read current books? Only by considering and criticizing in this way can we obtain better results.

　　We must not be "complacent and stick to old ways," as this will hinder our progress. We have already discovered many shortcomings in TCM academics. For example:

　　1. For patients with massive blood loss, TCM's emergency treatment is only to take medicines internally to stop bleeding and generate blood; it cannot directly transfuse blood. 2. For patients with cholera, dysentery, and dehydration, TCM's emergency treatment is only to take medicines internally to strengthen the heart and stop diarrhea; it cannot directly replenish fluids. These types of patients cannot wait for blood generation and diarrhea cessation to recover.

　　In addition, there are many things in TCM that are worthy of our scientific research to promote and enrich them. For example, we know that many cases of paralysis are cured by acupuncture (according to reports from the Zhuoxian County Anti-Epidemic Brigade). We should explore it in the context of scientific theory.

　　For example, Cangzhu for beriberi, Changshan for malaria, and Ya Danzi for dysentery have been recorded since ancient times, but we have not yet researched and promoted them.

　　In summary: In the history of Chinese cultural development, there are many accumulated experiences in medicine, which are worthy of our cherishing.

　　At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Western science began to be imported into China, and it was accepted by some people at that time. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" was somewhat close to the edge of science. Later, due to the closed-door policy of the Qing Dynasty and the semi-feudal and semi-colonial rule of the past century, Chinese science could not develop. In medicine, one type of person was complacent and stuck to old ways, while another type of person regarded TCM academics as worthless and ignored them. This hindered the development of TCM academics in a scientific direction.

　　Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, we can embark on a new path under the leadership, care, and support of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. The first thing we must do is unite and organize. Only with organization can we collectively study and learn, can we improve, can we avoid being forever behind in academics, experience, and diagnosis, can we progress, observe, delve into, can we recognize science, approach science, understand science, and embark on the path of science.

### 中医要走上科学的道路

　　中医要走上科学的道路
    潘兆鹏
    在即将到来的第一届全国卫生会议上，各地中医代表亦将参加共同商讨研究如何为中国人民健康事业而努力。
    中央人民政府对中医是关心的。曾努力爱护扶助和提高他们，团结中医的力量，发挥他们为人民服务的精神。中央人民政府卫生部在本年四月间曾发出指示，给全国各级卫生机关一个任务——要认真作好团结中医的工作。大家可以回想，在国民党反动统治时期，在他们几万道的命令中，对于中医问题，除去颁布束缚限制他们的条例规则以外，还有什么呢？
    我从一九二七年考取中医，开业已经二十年。学医的时候，由于个人环境的限制才学中医。过去学医是很困难的，只有先从小学毕业，考入中学，中学毕业，才能去考医科大学。医科大学每年又能招多少新生呢？我们知道，投考的有时候到七八百人，考取的只有四十人名额。因此有许多中学毕业的学生，去考医大，想去学医，结果受到限制。同时，在过去那种社会里，人民都很贫困，能在中学毕业的有多少人？即使你有志学医，往往不能如愿以偿。
    学中医的人，恐怕有许多都是受反动派的统治与限制，陷于文化落后的状态。
    我学中医，虽然曾按一定的程序来读书，来佐诊，但弄不清所以然的地方很多。举过去一个研究的例子来说明：“脉学”是中医诊断上不可少的部分。但如果追求脉的发源，在中医有关脉学的书籍中告诉我们的是：“十二经中，皆有动脉，独取寸口，以决人的生死顺逆。”“血脉者，如环之无端。”在一般概念上讲是有一些道理。但是脉为什么跳呢？在李濒湖四言举要上讲：“脉乃血脉，气血之先；血之隧道，气息应焉！”
    我们从中医书上，去找脉的发源，脉的跳动，得不到很具体很明确的回答。我们要钻研这个问题，不能不对科学的医学作一次探讨，才知道心脏与血压的关系，才知道动脉与静脉的不同，才知道大循环的状况。
    我个人对于中医学术，有几点意见，愿贡献给大家参考。
    （一）从旧的经验基础上学习新的科学。中医医学在数千年来无数次自觉或不自觉的尝试中，自然地累积了许多医理与经验，可是它还包含许多反科学的成份。因此，接受科学真理是必要的：一方面要打破它特有的玄学推想部分；一方面要接受新的医学知识来充实它，提高它。
    所以我们应该学习。不学当然也不会知道。我们应当遵从中央卫生部贺诚副部长在北京中医学会成立大会上给我们的指示：
    “中医的进修提高问题，是要学会一门新技术，首先必须破除门户之见，要虚心学习。今后在提高问题上，中医可能获得一些好的条件，中医就应该好好地利用这些条件，再加上中医自己很多的经验，会使自己更充实起来，这才是中医发展的前途。”
    （二）整理中医医学，发挥实事求是精神。中医学术内容，不可否认的是有些蕴藏可贵的地方，我们如果要去追求这种医学价值，需要好好整理一次旧医学。要以客观的、科学的态度，发挥实事求是的精神。例如：“风”为百病之长。到底“风”是否实有的呢？“风是从外来的中风瘫痪病。”在今天，以这个“风”字作解答一切病原，还可以吗？不要把问题看错，也不要把问题看得近似与模糊。
    （三）应该接受批判。不怕批判，只有经过批判才能进步，才能发展。批判时要注意拿实际事例来作对照、比较，发觉出什么地方有错误，研究出正确的结论。科学是从不断的批判中进步的。
    在现在还读千百年前的书对呢？还是多读现在的书对呢？多读现在的书与千百年前的书有什么不同的结果？只读千百年前的书不读现在的书，会发生什么结果？能够这样考虑、批判，才可以得到较好的结果。
    我们千万不要“固步自封”，这会障碍我们的进步。我们在中医学术上已发现了许多缺点。例如：
    一、中医对大量失血的病人的救急处理，只是内服药品，止血生血；不能直接输血。二、中医对霍乱、疫痢、脱水的病人救急处理，只是内服药品，强心，止泻；不能直接补水。这类病人，是等不了生血、止泻来恢复的。
    另外，中医方面有许多东西是值得我们加以科学的研究，使之发扬充实的。例如我们知道有些瘫痪，用针灸治好的很多（根据涿县防疫大队报告）。我们应在科学的理论上加以探讨。
    又如苍术治脚气，常山治疟疾，鸦蛋子治赤痢，很古以来就有了记载，但我们还没有加以研究发扬。
    总括起来：中国文化发展史上，在医学方面积蓄的经验很多，这是值得我们珍视的。
    明代末年，西洋科学开始输入中国，当时曾为一部分人所接受。明李时珍著的本草纲目，多少接近了科学的边缘。以后又因为满清的闭关自守，和近百年来的半封建半殖民地的统治，中国的科学得不到发展。在医学方面，一种人是固步自封，抱残守缺；另一种人是把中医学术看作一文不值，不加理睬。这就阻碍了中医学术向科学的方向发展。
    由于人民解放战争的胜利，我们能够在中央人民政府卫生部的领导、爱护、扶助下，走向新的道路了。我们第一就要团结组织起来。有了组织，才能集体研究学习，才能提高一步，才能不至于在学术、经验、诊断上永远落后，才能进步、观摩、钻研，才能认识科学，接近科学，了解科学，走上科学的道路。
