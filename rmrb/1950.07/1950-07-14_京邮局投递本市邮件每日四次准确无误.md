　　Beijing Post Office Delivers Local Mail Four Times Daily with Accuracy
    [This newspaper reported] Since June 5th, the Beijing Post Office has implemented a system of delivering local mail four times a day. Mail mutually sent within the city before 4:00 PM is guaranteed to be delivered on the same day. Registered mail, express mail, and regular express mail are delivered six times a day. Regular express mail placed in mailboxes before 8:00 PM, or express mail mutually sent within the city that is delivered to various post offices before closing time, can be delivered that same evening.

    In the past, the Beijing Post Office only delivered mail twice a day, at 7:00 AM and 1:30 PM. Mail received after 1:30 PM had to be delayed until the next day for delivery. Last May, the second delivery time was changed to 4:00 PM. From November 15th, the system was changed to three deliveries per day, ensuring that mail placed in mailboxes before 1:00 PM could be delivered on the same day. Although postal workers already felt busy and tired, this still could not meet the needs of people from all walks of life in the capital. The bureau, with the goal of "not allowing mail to remain in the post office for even one extra minute without reason," continued to strive to improve its operations. First, individual backward postal workers were educated and persuaded ideologically. Then, work methods were researched and improved, overcoming several difficulties. After several months of effort, the achievement of delivering four times a day was finally made possible. (Chen Xin)

　　京邮局投递本市邮件每日四次准确无误
    【本报讯】北京市邮局自六月五日起实行本市邮件每日投递四次以来，每日下午四时前，本市互寄邮件，保证当天送到；挂号及快信、平快信每日投递六次，晚八时前投入信筒信箱的平快信，或在各邮局停止营业前交寄的本市互寄快信，当晚均可投出。
    京市邮局过去每日仅上午七时及下午一时半投递邮件两次，一时半以后邮件，即须延至第二日始能发出。去年五月将第二次投递时间改为下午四时，十一月十五日起改为每日投递三次，做到每日下午一时前投入信筒信箱的邮件，当天可以送达。虽邮局工作人员已感忙累，但仍不能适应首都各界人民需要。该局乃以“不使邮件无故在邮局多停留一分钟”为目标，继续努力改进业务。首先在思想上对个别落后邮递员教育说服，并在工作方法上，研究改进，克服了若干困难，经数月之努力，始做出今日每天投递四次的成绩。（陈新）
