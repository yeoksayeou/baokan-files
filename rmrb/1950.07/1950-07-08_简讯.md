    Improving Procedures for Accuracy and Speed: Fengxian Sub-branch Rectifies Operations
    Fengxian County, adjacent to Shanghai, produces a large quantity of brine salt, with a daily output of around 3,000 dan (approximately 300,000 lbs).

However, it was also pointed out that some cadres held ideas such as "private enterprises are highly speculative" and "private enterprises only care about making money," resulting in the phenomenon of not lending or lending less, which is incorrect and must be corrected in the future in accordance with national policy.
