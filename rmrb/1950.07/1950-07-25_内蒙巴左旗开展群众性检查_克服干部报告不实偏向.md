　　Inner Mongolia's Baling Left Banner Launches Mass Inspection to Overcome Cadre's Unrealistic Reporting Tendencies

　　[This newspaper dispatch] In Inner Mongolia's Zhaowuda League, Baling Left Banner, each district (or known as a "Nutuke". Note: A Nutuke is equivalent to a district, and the banner has six districts and four Nutukes) has launched a mass work inspection to overcome the phenomena of district cadres not going deep enough into their work and village cadres "reporting good news but not bad news." This year, due to the correct implementation of production policies, farmers and herdsmen in the banner have had high enthusiasm for production, and spring plowing and sowing were timely. In previous years, hoeing only began around the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar, but this year, by the Dragon Boat Festival, the land had generally been hoed twice. As a result, a sense of complacency has arisen among district and village cadres. District cadres only assign work without going deep to inspect it; among village cadres, the phenomenon of "reporting good news but not bad news" has occurred. To address this, the CCP Banner Committee proposed that each district, under the direct control of district cadres, launch work inspections between villages. During the spring plowing and summer hoeing, four districts responded to this call. Each district respectively gathered thirty district cadres and one hundred and twenty-one village cadres, and focusing on work districts as units, conducted mass inspections in various villages. A total of fifty administrative villages were inspected, and it was discovered that the reports of many villages were not truthful. For example, the cadres of Daolaomaodao Village in the first district reported that "all the dry land has been planted with early crops," but the inspection revealed that 410 mu were not planted. On June 22nd, Hudugeleng and Baimiaozi Villages in the fifth district reported that the first hoeing had been completed, but it was discovered that more than 300 mu had not been hoed. In some villages, because village cadres used coercive methods to organize the masses, many farmers' mutual aid production teams were fake. Some villages had not yet communicated the policy of allowing farmers to hire labor. Many village cadres did not participate in production or lead production, but spent all day "running errands" at the village office. This inspection had a great educational significance for district and village cadres, who all examined their past undesirable work styles. The CCP Banner Committee accepted this experience and, starting on July 5th, in conjunction with the government and youth and women's organizations, jointly selected twenty-four cadres from each district to form four "assessment and investigation teams" to go to each district and Nutuke, and select two types of villages, good and bad, to conduct "assessments and investigations" to promote work and lay the foundation for summarizing work. It is expected that the assessments and investigations will be completed by July 27th.

　　内蒙巴左旗开展群众性检查
    克服干部报告不实偏向
    【本报讯】内蒙昭乌达盟巴林左翼旗各区（或称努图克。按努图克相当于区，该旗有六个区和四个努图克）开展群众性的工作检查，以克服区干部工作不深入，村干部“报喜不报忧”的现象。该旗本年来由于正确地贯彻了生产政策，农牧民生产情绪高涨，春耕播种及时，往年到旧历端阳节才开始锄地，今年则到端阳节一般已锄了两遍地。因此区、村干部中普遍产生自满情绪，区干部只布置工作，不深入检查；村干部中，发生“报喜不报忧”的现象。为此，中共旗委提议各区由区干部直接掌握，开展村与村之间的工作检查。春耕、夏锄中，先后有四个区响应了这个号召，各区分别集中了三十名区干部和一百二十一名村干部，以工作小区为单位，有重点地到各村开展群众性的检查，共检查了五十个行政村，发现不少村庄的报告不真实。如一区刀老毛道村干部报告“有陇地都种上早田了”，结果查出四百一十亩未种。五区胡都格冷、白庙子村在六月二十二日报告头遍地都锄过了，结果发现有三百多亩未锄。有的村因为村干部以强迫命令方式要群众组织起来，许多农民的互助生产小组都是假的。有的村对允许农民雇工的政策，还没有传达。有许多村干部不参加生产、不领导生产，而整天在村公所“支差”。这次检查，给区、村干部教育意义很大，纷纷检讨了过去工作中的不良作风。中共旗委接受了此次经验，于七月五日起协同政府和青年、妇女团体，联合抽调各区干部二十四名，组成四个“评查小组”，赴各区和努图克，选择工作好坏的两类村庄进行“评查”，以推动工作，并打下总结工作的基础，预计七月二十七日可评查完毕。
