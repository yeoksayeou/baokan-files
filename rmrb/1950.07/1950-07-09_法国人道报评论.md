     French newspaper *L'Humanité* published two articles by Biéguerta on the 27th and 28th, commenting on the Korean people's struggle to defend freedom and peace, and American imperialism's intervention. The author said: The American air and naval intervention in Korea is a typical act of aggression. To justify this deliberate provocation, the murderer Truman clamored for the need to fight "communism" universally. According to Truman, "communism" has "gone beyond the use of subversion" and "now wants to use armed invasion." That is to say: For the U.S. State Department, Truman, and the warmongers, anyone who refuses to obey Washington's orders is an act of "subversion," and all resistance of the people to tyranny, the people's refusal to accept the "American way of life" imposed by the likes of Chiang Kai-shek, Bảo Đại, and Syngman Rhee, is an attack on the United States. All expressions of the people's desire for independence, the will to defend their homeland and resist aggressors, and the defensive war in which Korean patriots repelled more than a thousand acts of aggression on the 38th parallel, are "armed invasions." The bombing by American planes is not an "armed invasion," but a mere "legitimate measure."
    The author asked: Is it "legitimate" that the press releases from Syngman Rhee's headquarters originated from MacArthur's headquarters at the beginning of the invasion, and that MacArthur officially took command of the war? The author pointed out: The Korean people's struggle to resist aggression, fight oppression, and defend freedom and independence is in line with the interests of defending peace. The French people will continue to soberly watch the actions of the warmongers and respond to them by redoubling their efforts to fight for peace.

     法国人道报评论
    【新华社布拉格一日电】法国《人道报》于二十七、二十八两日发表比埃古尔塔达的两篇论文，评朝鲜人民保卫自由、保卫和平的斗争和美国帝国主义的干涉。作者说：美国海空军干涉朝鲜是一种典型的侵略行为。为了替这一蓄意的挑衅辩护，凶手杜鲁门大呼有普遍与“共产主义”作战的必要。照杜鲁门的说法，“共产主义”已经“超过了颠覆行为的运用”，而“现在要使用武装入侵”了。这就是说：对于美国国务院、杜鲁门，对于战争贩子，凡是拒绝服从华盛顿命令，就是“颠覆”行为，人民对暴政的一切反抗、人民拒绝接受对蒋介石、保大、李承晚之流所强加于身的“美国生活方式”，就是对美国的进攻。一切人民要求独立的表示，保卫国土和抵抗侵略者的意志，以及在北纬三八线上朝鲜爱国者击退千余次侵略行动的保卫战，都是“武装入侵”。美国飞机的轰炸倒不是“武装入侵”，而是单纯的“合法措施”。
    作者问道：难道侵略开始时，李承晚总部的公报发自麦克阿瑟大本营的事实，与麦克阿瑟正式掌握战事行动的总指挥是“合法”的吗？作者指出：朝鲜人民起来抵抗侵略，反抗压迫，保卫自由和独立的斗争，是符合于保卫和平利益的。法国人民将继续清醒地注视战争贩子的行动，以加倍努力为和平而斗争，来回答战争贩子。
