　　Gaoyang Cloth Industry Develops Properly Under the Support of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company

　　The Gaoyang cloth industry, which once enjoyed a high reputation in history, was on the verge of collapse before liberation due to poor management, outdated technology, and the destruction of the enemy and puppets. After liberation, it has gradually recovered and developed with the support of the local government and the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company through orders and other means. From January to April of this year, the industry produced a total of 110,000 bolts of cloth, paying wages and profits of over 2.5 million jin of red grain, which solved the livelihood problems of over 10,000 disaster victims. In order to help the industry improve technology and quality, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also adopted a wage reward system based on quality and technology, which has been very effective. With the improvement of white cloth quality, the printed cloth industry has also developed, increasing from a monthly output of more than 4,000 bolts in February this year to more than 30,000 bolts per month, and demand still exceeds supply. In addition to sales in Datong, Zhangjiakou, Pingbei, Taiyuan and other places, small merchants from Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong and other places also come to Gaoyang to purchase.

　　Tangshan Prefecture General Cooperative Lacks Inspection, Resulting in Huge Losses from Purchased Defective Cloth

　　The Tangshan Prefecture General Cooperative signed a contract with a certain unit to purchase 340,000 bolts of native cloth on its behalf. However, due to insufficient inspection when purchasing the native cloth, it was not discovered that the quality did not meet the standards until the cloth was delivered to the unit, which refused to accept the goods. After inspection, there were a total of 8,520 bolts of defective cloth. Because the Tangshan Prefecture General Cooperative did not follow the contract provisions, the unit declared the contract invalid and demanded the return of the paid funds and raw materials. For this reason, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative has ordered cooperative cadres at all levels in Tangshan Prefecture to conduct self-criticism, and instructed that product specifications and quality must be emphasized in the future, opposing the complacent view of haphazard work and the bureaucratic work style of failing to go deep into the lower levels for inspection.

　　Yutian Avoids Flood Disaster Through Flood Fighting in Storm

　　In the tenth district of Yutian, Hebei, on June 6, wind and rain were intertwined, and the Jiyun River water rose sharply. In some places, the river water had splashed over the embankments, and the situation was very dangerous. The district leading cadres immediately mobilized more than 1,000 men and women from five villages along the embankment to fight the flood in the wind and rain and increase the height of the embankment. Women also waded through three or four feet of water to cut reeds and build embankments. On the same day, the entire embankment was raised by two feet and widened by two feet, and the flood was finally overcome, preserving the mature wheat fields.
　　(Zuo Ming, Tian Runmin)

　　In the eighth district of Yutian, Hebei, due to neglecting prevention and losing leadership in inspection, the embankment suddenly breached at night when the Jiyun River flooded on June 6, and 400 mu of wheat fields in the river bend were completely flooded, causing unnecessary losses.

　　Army and Civilians in Dongjiaoyuan, Hebei Exchange Labor and Help Each Other

　　A certain production unit stationed in Dongjiaoyuan, Hebei, sought help and guidance from nearby farmers because they were not familiar with rice transplanting techniques. Because they were too busy during the wheat harvest season, they adopted a labor exchange method after consultation and research: farmers transplanted one mu of rice for the troops, and the troops harvested two and a half mu of wheat for the farmers. Therefore, the difficulties of both parties were resolved, and the rice transplanting and wheat harvesting work was completed. The relationship between the army and the people has also become closer.

　　Troops in Donggou Village, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Help Farmers Eliminate Insects

　　In Donggou Village, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi, cotton was found to be eaten by insects during the wheat harvest season, which was quite serious. In 200 mu of cotton fields, the cotton leaves were almost completely eaten in less than two days. The farmers were busy with the wheat harvest and had no time to catch insects. A certain regiment stationed in Jingyang automatically helped to eliminate the pests, thereby saving more than 300 mu of cotton fields.

　　Xiaozhan Farm in Hebei Teaches a Certain Unit Rice Transplanting Techniques

　　A certain production unit adjacent to Xiaozhan Farm in Hebei was not skilled in the technique of rice transplanting in saline-alkali land. Therefore, more than 80 people were selected to hold a rice transplanting training class, where technical cadres from Xiaozhan Farm lectured on rice transplanting techniques and exchanged rice transplanting experiences. After collective learning, every soldier learned how to transplant rice, ensuring the smooth completion of the rice transplanting work.

　　Yancheng Military Region in Northern Jiangsu Achieves Results in River Dredging and Cotton Planting

　　The troops of the Yancheng Military Region in northern Jiangsu have achieved great results in the campaign to dredge rivers and plant cotton. In addition to performing the task of strengthening coastal defense and consolidating urban and rural security, the troops in the entire region have also engaged in production. Up to now, the troops in the entire region have reclaimed and planted more than 900 mu of cotton, and excavated 79,533 cubic meters of earth for river dredging. On May 17, the military region held a summary meeting to select models and summarize experiences.

　　State-Owned Factories and Mines in Xuanhua Overfulfill Tasks

　　The workers and staff of state-owned mines and factories in Xuanhua City, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, launched a boiling production competition in the Red May competition, and have successfully completed and exceeded the production tasks. Among them, the Yantongshan Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine exceeded the original plan by 2.46 percent. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant also broke through various quotas, such as the turbine oil quota. According to regulations, 0.104 kg should be used per kilowatt-hour of electricity, but the actual amount was only 0.024 kg.

    在花纱布公司扶植下高阳布业有正当发展
    历史上曾负盛名的高阳布业，解放前曾因经营不善，技术落后，加上敌伪摧残，频于垮台。解放后，经当地政府与国营花纱布公司通过订购等方式予以扶植，已逐渐恢复发展。该业今年一月到四月共计产布十一万匹，支付工资利润二五○余万斤红粮，解决了万余灾民的生活问题。花纱布公司为了帮助该业改进技术，提高质量，又采取了根据质量，技术不同的工资奖励办法，收效极大。随着白布质量的提高，印花布业亦得到发展，已由今年二月月产四千多匹到现在月产三万匹以上，仍感供不应求。除行销大同、张家口、平北、太原等地外，并有陕西、河南、山东等地小商贩到高阳采购。
