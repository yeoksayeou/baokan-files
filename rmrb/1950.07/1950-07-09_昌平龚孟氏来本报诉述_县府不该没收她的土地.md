　　Changping Resident Gong Mengshi Appeals to This Newspaper: County Government Should Not Confiscate Her Land
　　To the Editors:
　　I am Gong Mengshi from Qianbaihujian Village, Changping County. I am 54 years old this year and currently work as a nanny in Professor Li Jinxi's home. Since my husband died when I was 25, I have been working as a domestic worker in Beijing to support myself, and it has been 25 years now. In these 25 years, I earned 200 silver dollars and remitted them to my mother's home for safekeeping, intending to use them as living expenses when I got old and returned home. Later, my father spent this money. In 1947, I returned home, and my father gave me four mu of land as compensation, with a written agreement. Last year, in the first month of the lunar calendar, when the village was carrying out land reform, the Baihujian Village cadres confiscated my four mu of land and distributed it to others. After hearing this news, I returned home in the twelfth lunar month to ask for the land back. But the village cadres said, "You don't have a household registration in your mother's home, let your brother give you land!" I said, "My brother has already given me land, why should I ask him for more?" As a result, I didn't get the land back. This year, in the first month of the old calendar, I went back again and talked to District Chief Bai. District Chief Bai said, "Land reform hasn't ended yet, you can get your land back." He told me to hurry back to Baihujian. After I returned, the village cadres still wouldn't give it to me. Now that half a year has passed, I feel sad when I think about this. I am asking you to publish this in the newspaper and ask the Changping County government to help me resolve this issue.

　　Editor's Note: Based on this situation, Gong Mengshi's four mu of land should not have been confiscated and should be returned or given appropriate compensation. We hope that the local county and district governments will handle this based on the actual situation.

　　昌平龚孟氏来本报诉述  县府不该没收她的土地编辑同志：
    我是昌平县前白虎涧村人，今年五十四岁，现在黎锦熙教授家当保姆。自我二十五岁那年丈夫死后，就到北京当佣工，自谋生活，到现在已有二十五年了。在这二十五年中，我挣得二百块现洋汇到娘家给保存着，准备年老回家后当生活费。后来家父把这笔钱花了。一九四七年我回家，家父给我四亩地作为抵偿，并立有字据。去年阴历正月，村里进行土地改革时，白虎涧村干部把我的四亩地没收了分配给别人。我听到这个消息后，就在腊月间回家要地。可是村干部说：“你在娘家没有户口，由你兄弟给你地吧！”我说：“我兄弟已给了我地，干么还能跟他要？”结果也没要上。今年旧历正月，我又回去一趟，找柏区长谈了一下。柏区长说：“土地改革还没结束哩，可以要回你的地。”并叫我赶快回白虎涧去。我回去后，村干部还是不给。现在过了半年了，我想起这事心里就难过。我就来请你们给登个报，叫昌平县政府帮助我解决。
    龚孟氏口述，本刊记者笔录。
    编者按：根据这个情况来看，龚孟氏的四亩土地是不应该被没收的，应该退还或给以适当补偿。望当地县区政府根据实际情况加以处理。
