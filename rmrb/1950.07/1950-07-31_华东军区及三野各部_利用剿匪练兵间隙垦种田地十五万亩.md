　　East China Military Region and 3rd Field Army Units
    Cultivate 150,000 Mu of Land During Lulls in Bandit Suppression and Training

    [Shanghai News] Jiefang Daily News: Since the spring, the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and various units of the Third Field Army have carried out agricultural, sideline, and dike repair and river diversion construction tasks during gaps in combat, bandit suppression, and training, achieving remarkable results.

    In terms of agricultural production, the units have cultivated approximately 150,000 mu of land, the vast majority of which is newly reclaimed wasteland this year. For example, among the more than 80,000 mu of land cultivated by units such as the Shandong and North Jiangsu Military Regions and a certain army corps, more than 60,000 mu are newly reclaimed wasteland. Thanks to the active production of the units, the latest rice seedlings were transplanted by mid-June. The emerged seedlings are very robust.

    If there are no unexpected floods or droughts in the future, the total value of agricultural and sideline production for the entire year in the Luzhong, Bohai, and Southern Anhui Military Regions is estimated to reach more than 10 million jin of grain.

    There has also been significant development in sideline production in the past six months. According to incomplete statistics, eight units, including the Shandong, Southern Anhui, Southern Jiangsu Military Regions, and a certain army corps, raised more than 15,000 pigs and sheep, produced more than 2.6 million jin of mushroom tofu and bean sprouts, and collected 315,000 dan of firewood. Transportation has also been quite profitable. The Zhejiang Military Region and a certain army corps stationed in Zhejiang alone earned more than 264,000 jin of rice and 290 million yuan in Renminbi. Many units have also trialed more formal factories. For example, the Shandong Military Region has more than 100 factories and workshops, including industrial, mining, chemical, oil pressing, flour milling, and sauce making facilities. The troops responsible for coastal defense have also engaged in fishing and salt production.

    In addition to the above-mentioned agricultural and sideline production, several units have vigorously carried out various construction projects. For example, six units, including the direct subordinate units of the Third Field Army and the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison, participated in dike repair, road construction, and river diversion projects, completing more than 438,300 cubic meters of earthwork and more than 94,800 workdays.

    In the process of production and construction, in order to carry out work in a planned manner and learn from production experience, some units organized production inspection teams to conduct inspections or visits; others organized forums with veteran farmers to compile production experience into booklets and distribute them to companies. In addition, the units also launched labor competitions. For example, Yang Shigui, the company commander of a combat model company in a certain unit of the Northern Anhui Military Region, planned to win the glorious title of "Production Model Company"; Li Daoguang, a first-class combat hero, planned to earn another first-class merit in production; and the soldiers of the units also formulated plans to strive for meritorious service, join the Party, and join the Youth League in production and construction.

    However, in the process of production and construction, due to insufficient leadership experience and inadequate implementation of production policies, some deviations have also occurred. For example, some units failed to grasp the center of work, causing production work to affect bandit suppression; some units did not calculate costs, raw materials, and product sales, resulting in unplanned planting, lack of production technology, and significant waste; some units engaged in activities that competed with the people for profits and destroyed policies and infringed upon the interests of the masses, such as felling public and private mountain forests. These issues have now attracted the attention of leading cadres of the units and have been corrected.

### 华东军区及三野各部  利用剿匪练兵间隙垦种田地十五万亩

　　华东军区及三野各部
    利用剿匪练兵间隙垦种田地十五万亩
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：人民解放军华东军区及第三野战军各部，入春以来，利用战斗、剿匪、练兵等项任务的空隙，进行了农业、副业以及修堤，导河等生产建设，并做出了显著成绩。
    在农业生产方面，各部垦种土地约在十五万亩左右，其中绝大部分为今年新开的荒地。如山东、苏北军区及某兵团等单位垦种的八万多亩土地中，即有六万多亩是新开的荒地。由于各部的积极生产，六月中旬即将最晚的稻秧插完。出土禾苗都很茁壮。
    鲁中区、渤海、皖南三个军区，如今后无意外的水旱等灾害，预计全年农业、副业生产的总值，可达粮食一千余万斤。
    在副业生产上，半年来也有很大的发展。根据不完全的统计，山东、皖南、苏南军区及某兵团八个单位，即养猪、羊一万五千余只，蘑豆腐、生豆芽二百六十余万斤，拾柴三十一万五千余担。搞运输也获利不少。仅浙江军区与驻浙江某兵团就赚米二十六万四千余斤、人民币二亿九千余万元。有不少单位还试办了较正规的工厂。如山东军区即有工、矿、化学、油坊、粉坊、酱园等工厂、作坊一百余座。担任海防的部队，并从事了渔业、盐业生产。
    除了上述农、副业生产以外，还有若干单位大力进行了各项建设工程。如第三野战军直属队和沪宁警备部队等六个单位，参加了修堤、筑路、导河等工程建设，完成四十三万八千三百余土方又九万四千八百余工。
    在生产建设中，各部为了做到有计划地进行工作，并吸取生产经验，有的组织了生产检查组，进行检查或访问；有的组织老农座谈，将生产经验汇印成册，发给连队。此外，各部还展开了劳动竞赛。如皖北军区某部战斗模范连杨世桂连长，计划再争取一个“生产模范连”的光荣称号；一等战斗功臣李道广计划再立一个生产一等功；各部战士也都纷纷订出了计划，争取在生产建设中立功、入党、入团。
    但在生产建设中，由于领导经验的不足，生产政策贯彻的不够，也产生了若干偏向。如有的单位掌握不住工作中心，使生产工作影响了剿匪；有的单位不计算成本、原料和产品的供销，种植无计划，缺乏生产技术，浪费很大；有的发生与民争利，砍伐公私山林等破坏政策与侵犯群众利益的行为，现已引起各部领导干部的注意并得到了纠正。
