"No one can live without the other!"
     —A Record of Two Mutual Aid Teams in Chengguan, Qinyuan Old Revolutionary Base Area

    The mutual aid teams of Huo Suozhu and Zhang Laigui in Chengguan County, Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, were organized after the long-term plunder by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit troops, when the people's lives were difficult and labor and livestock were extremely scarce. They have been in existence for more than four years. These two mutual aid teams have developed day by day during the transition from war to peaceful production, showing a new atmosphere.

    New Demands and New Development
    According to our household-by-household survey of the Suozhu and Laigui teams, the demands of the twenty-three households are different: fifteen households demanded to "organize to reclaim more wasteland, produce more grain, add livestock, buy pigs and sheep, and build houses"; four households demanded to "learn techniques and cultivate the land well" in the mutual aid team; two households demanded to "work collectively and transform themselves"; one household demanded to "overcome difficulties"; and one household, because of too many family members, was unable to manage the family and attempted to "lead family production with mutual assistance." These demands show that it is not simply to overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock. Meeting everyone's new demands such as "organize to expand production, improve technology, and become rich" has become the basic key to the consolidation and development of the two teams. For example, the Laigui team increased grain production by 2.55 dou per mu last year due to improved farming techniques; with the increased income, they collectively purchased ten large farm tools, twenty-four farm tools for harvesting autumn and threshing summer crops, jointly opened an oil mill, and mutually built twenty-two new houses. When the Suozhu team was formulating this year's production plan, they proposed the slogan "Production and thrift for reproduction, the whole team should buy a flock of sheep." They used the twenty shi of surplus grain obtained from collective labor last year, plus the grain harvested from the newly reclaimed land this year, to buy about one hundred sheep. The Laigui team's plan is to process and fertilize, improve technology, and reclaim more wasteland, striving for each household to raise one head of livestock and repair three houses. Team member Guo Qicheng happily said: "If you want to live in a new house and produce more grain, you can only engage in mutual aid production." After the collapse of Fan Fulin's mutual aid team in the same village, they all demanded to join the Laigui team. They said: "We are willing to cooperate with whoever can produce more grain and have a good time."

    Researching Technology to Improve Farming Methods
    In order to meet the new demands of team members—improving farming techniques and increasing production—the Suozhu and Laigui teams first took experienced old farmers as the core to impart techniques. Secondly, in combination with the production of each period, they collectively studied, improved techniques, and conducted experiments. When applying fertilizer, they not only increased the amount of fertilizer, but also implemented what kind of land should be applied with what kind of fertilizer. For example, ash fertilizer and donkey and horse manure generate warmth, which is suitable for cold and sticky lower wet land; night soil is cool, which is suitable for flat dry land; artemisia fertilizer is neutral, which is suitable for flat sandy land. When weeding seedlings, pay attention to weeding techniques. Last year, it was generally weeded three times, and the lower wet land was weeded five times. All this not only increased the yield, but also made the seeds full, as team member Fan Chunxi said: "I used to grind three or four dou of rice from one shi of grain, but now I grind one shi of rice from one shi.five grain.”

    Closely Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations to Increase Income
    The consolidation and development of the two teams is not only due to the improvement of technology, but also due to the close combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. The two teams have a total of forty-one full laborers, cultivating two hundred and seventy-three mu of land, with an average of fifteen mu of land cultivated by each laborer per year. Thanks to the scientific division of labor and collective labor, there is a lot of surplus labor. They have planned to organize surplus labor to contract various livelihoods. In addition to solving household expenses, the wages earned are also pooled to open two oil mills. Last year, the Laigui team organized surplus labor to work outside, earning more than 1,950 jin of millet, buying farm tools, and expanding agricultural production. Last summer, the Suozhu team earned 2.2 dou of rice by contracting work, sewed a new set of clothes for each person, and bought a towel. However, contracting is not frequent. They are unwilling to be idle, so they organize surplus labor to reclaim wasteland and chop firewood. Such a relatively complex mutual aid labor must pay special attention to the issue of calculating value according to labor. Their solution to this problem is: fixed points and flexible tasks, converting tasks into work points, settling accounts four times a year, after clearing work, making up for labor shortages with rice, and getting rice for surplus labor. The oil mill implements a wage system. The oil mill uses the labor of the mutual aid team and pays rice according to the work points. They say: "If the donkey bites its neck and changes the work, no one wants to lose out!"

    New Methods of Small Group Leadership
    In the leadership of the mutual aid team, they have created a new leadership method to overcome the tendency to treat the mutual aid team as an administrative organization. The head of the mutual aid team is generally an activist who emerges from the team members, and therefore is often elected as a cadre by the masses of the whole village, which makes him either relax his specific leadership of the mutual aid team or confuse the affairs of the mutual aid team with administrative affairs. However, the Zhang Laigui mutual aid team did not do so. Their method is: after being elected as a cadre, the position of the head of the mutual aid team is revoked, and the head of the team is re-elected in a democratic manner. The original head of the team participates in mutual aid production as a team member as usual, and helps solve problems in the mutual aid team in the capacity of a cadre. This method is also one of the important conditions for the consolidation and development of the mutual aid team.

            Collectivist Ideas and Feelings are Growing in Mutual Aid Production
    After several years of mutual aid production, new collectivist ideas and feelings have gradually grown. For example, in handling weddings and funerals, in the past it was a "family system," but now everyone in the mutual aid team helps. For example, Guo Ziqing of the Laigui team got married last year, and there were difficulties with grain. The team members lent him three dou and two dou each, a total of five shi, to help him get married smoothly. When Hu Guixi of the Suozhu team buried someone, the entire team automatically helped him with more than eighty work points. In short, no matter who has difficulties in the team, everyone helps to solve them. The development of this collectivist emotion has greatly helped the consolidation of the mutual aid team. As they said: "Our mutual aid team is like fish helping water and water helping fish, no one can live without the other!"

### “谁也离不了谁！”——记老区沁源城关的两个互助组

　　“谁也离不了谁！”
     ——记老区沁源城关的两个互助组
    山西省沁源城县关霍锁柱、张来贵互助组，是在日寇与国民党匪军的长期掠夺之后、群众生活困难、劳畜力极其缺乏的情况下组织起来的，到现在已有四年多的历史了。这两个互助组在由战争转入和平生产时期，日益发展，呈现着一种新的气象。
    新的要求和新的发展
    根据我们对锁柱、来贵两组的逐户调查，二十三户的要求是不同的：十五户要求“组织起来多开荒，多打粮，添牲口、买猪羊、修盖房屋”；四户要求在互助组里“学技术、种好地”；两户要求“集体劳动、改造自己”；一户要求“克服困难”；一户因家里人多当不了家，企图在“互相帮助下领导家庭生产”。这些要求说明了不是单纯为克服劳畜力的困难。满足大家“组织起来扩大生产，提高技术，发家致富”等新要求，成了两个组的巩固与发展的基本关键。如来贵组由于去年提高了耕作技术，每亩增产粮食二斗五升五合；把增加的收入，集体购买大农具十件，收秋和打夏场用的农具二十四件，伙开油房一座，并互助盖起新房二十二间。锁柱组在订今年生产计划时，提出“生产节约再生产，全组要买一群羊”的口号。他们去年集体劳动所得的二十石剩余粮食，加上今年在新开荒地上所收的粮食，又买一百个左右的羊。来贵组的计划是加工加肥，提高技术多开荒，争取每户能喂一头牲口，每户修好三间房。组员郭起成高兴的说：“想住新房多打粮，只有互助搞生产”。同村范福临互助组垮台后，全部要求参加来贵组。他们说：“跟谁能多打粮食，闹好时光，就愿和谁互助”。
    研究技术改进耕作方法
    锁柱、来贵组为满足组员们的新要求——提高耕作技术，增加生产，首先以有丰富耕作经验的老农为核心，传授技术。其次是结合各个时期的生产，集体研究，改进技术，并作实验。在施肥时，不光是大量增肥，而且实行什么样的地，施什么样的肥。比如灰肥和驴马粪发暖，宜上发冷带粘性的下湿地；圊肥发凉，宜上平旱地；蒿肥性平，宜上平沙地。锄苗时，注意锄苗技术，去年一般锄了三遍，下湿地就锄到五遍。这一切不但使产量增多，而且籽粒饱满，正如组员范春喜说：“我以前一石谷碾三、四斗米，现在石五谷就碾了一石米”。
    农副业紧密结合增加收入
    两组的巩固和发展，不但由于技术的提高，而且由于农副业的紧密结合。两组共有全劳力四十一个，种地二百七十三亩，每个劳动力平均一年种地十五亩。由于科学分工和集体劳动的结果，有了不少的剩余劳动力。他们有计划地组织剩余劳动力，包揽各种生活，所赚工资除解决家庭零用外，还集股开设了两座油房。来贵组去年组织剩余劳力出外揽活，赚米一千九百五十多斤小米，购买农具，扩大了农业生产。锁柱组去年夏天揽工赚米二石二斗，每人缝新衣一件，买毛巾一条。但包工并不经常，他们不愿闲着，就组织剩余劳动力开荒打柴。这样内容比较复杂的互助劳动，必须特别注意按劳计值问题。他们解决这一问题的办法是：死分活计，按活折工，一年四算账，清工后，亏工出米，余工得米。油房是工资制，油房用了互助组工，按工出米。他们的说法是：“驴啃脖子工变工，谁想亏谁也不行”！
    小组领导的新方法
    在互助组的领导上，他们创造了一种新的领导方法，以克服把互助组当成行政组织的偏向。互助组长一般是从组员中涌现出来的积极分子，因而往往会被全村群众选为干部，使他或者放松了对互助组的具体领导，或者把互助组的事情和行政上的事情混淆起来。但是，张来贵互助组却没有如此。他们的办法是：凡是被选举为干部以后，互助组长的职务即被解除，用民主方式重选组长。原先的组长即以组员身份照常参加互助生产，以干部身份帮助解决互助组中的问题。这个办法也是互助组巩固与发展的重要条件之一。
            在互助生产中滋长着集体主义的思想和感情
    经过几年来的互助生产，新的集体主义的思想和感情逐渐成长了。如办婚、丧大事，过去都是“本家制”，如今是互助组大家帮忙。如来贵组郭自清去年结婚，粮食困难，组员们便你三斗我二斗，共借给他五石，帮助他顺利的结了婚。锁柱组胡贵喜埋葬人，全组自动帮他八十多个工。总之组内不管谁有了困难，都是大家帮助解决，这种集体主义的情感的发展，大大帮助了互助组的巩固。正如他们所说的：“咱们互助组是鱼帮水、水帮鱼，谁也离不了谁！”
