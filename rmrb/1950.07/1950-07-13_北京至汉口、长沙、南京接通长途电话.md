　　Beijing to Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing Connect to Long-Distance Telephone
	[Report from Our Newspaper] The long-distance telephone service between Beijing and Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing and other places, in the past, due to the destruction of wired telephone circuit equipment by the war, or simply incomplete equipment, had only been open for radio telephone service on a timed basis. Beijing could only communicate with Nanjing, Changsha, Hankou and other places for one or two hours a day. Recently, the General Directorate of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, in order to meet the urgent need for close ties between the capital and various parts of the South, from the planning and design of the National Long-Distance Engineering Conference, through the efforts of technical engineering personnel and the vast number of employees for several months, completed the wired telephone circuit between Beijing and Hankou and other places in early June. Now, calls can be made at any time without time restrictions.

　　北京至汉口、长沙、南京接通长途电话
    【本报讯】北京至汉口、长沙、南京等地的长途电话，过去因有线电话电路设备为战争破坏，或根本设备不全，一向只是按时间开放无线电话。北京与南京、长沙、汉口等处每天只能通话一、二小时。最近，邮电部电信总局为适应首都与南方各地密切联系的迫切需要，自全国长途工务会议进行筹划设计起，数月来经技术工程人员及广大职工的努力，已于六月初将北京至汉口等地间有线电话电路，通。现在随时可以通话接不受时间限制。
