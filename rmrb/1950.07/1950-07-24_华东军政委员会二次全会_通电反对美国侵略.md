　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd. The Second Plenary Session of the East China Military and Political Committee passed on the 22nd the "Telegram to the People of the Whole Country Opposing American Imperialist Armed Intervention in Taiwan and Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement." The telegram first expressed unanimous and firm support for the statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government on July 6th, and stated: The East China Military and Political Committee has resolved to mobilize more extensively the 130 million people of East China to strive for the thorough realization of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The telegram continued: Liberating Taiwan is the primary task of all Chinese people, especially the people of East China. Since its establishment, the East China Military and Political Committee, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, has been actively engaged in all preparatory work to accomplish the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. The telegram pointed out: American imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. This paper tiger has long been pierced by the victorious fists of the Chinese people and is now being pierced by the anti-aggression iron fists of the Korean people. American imperialism has dropped all its masks and brazenly launched a direct aggression against Korea and armed obstruction of our liberation of Taiwan. This does not show its strength but rather illustrates that as the movement of Asian people for independence and freedom rises higher and higher, and as the forces of world people defending peace are constantly strengthened, the position of American imperialism is becoming more isolated, leading it to take this adventurous action. Such blatant aggression by American imperialism is precisely following the old path of German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, and its result will inevitably be to repeat the disastrous fate of fascism. The telegram concluded: We Chinese people love peace and oppose aggression. We must unite the peace-loving people of the world, strengthen the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, smash all aggressive actions and conspiracies of American imperialism, and safeguard lasting peace in Asia and the world.

　　华东军政委员会二次全会
    通电反对美国侵略
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东军政委员会第二次全体委员会议，于二十二日通过“为反对美帝国主义武装干涉台湾暨拥护周外长声明致全国人民的通电”。该电首对中央人民政府周恩来外长七月六日的声明，表示一致坚决拥护，并称：华东军政委员会决号召全华东一亿三千万人民更广泛地动员起来，誓为周外长这一声明的彻底实现而奋斗。通电继称：解放台湾是全中国人民特别是华东人民的首要任务。华东军政委员会自成立以来，即在中央人民政府领导之下，积极从事一切准备工作，以完成解放台湾的光荣任务。通电指出：美帝国主义是外强中干的。这只纸老虎早已为中国人民的胜利拳头所戳穿，现在又为朝鲜人民的反侵略铁拳所戳穿。美帝国主义丢下了一切假面具，悍然发动对于朝鲜的直接侵略和武装阻挠我们解放台湾，这不是显示它力量的强大，而是说明了在亚洲人民争取独立与自由的运动日益高涨，在全世界人民保卫和平的力量不断增强的时候，美帝国主义的地位更趋孤立，以致采取此项冒险行为。美帝国主义这样的露骨侵略，正是走上了德、意、日法西斯的老路，其结果必然要重踏法西斯灭亡的覆辙。通电最后称：我们中国人民是爱好和平反对侵略的。我们要团结全世界爱好和平的人们，增强以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，粉碎美帝国主义一切侵略的行为和阴谋，保卫亚洲与世界的持久和平。
