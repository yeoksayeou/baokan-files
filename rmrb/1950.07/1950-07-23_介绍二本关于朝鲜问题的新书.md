　　The Chinese people's movement against American imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea is unfolding extensively. To coordinate with this movement, the Xinhua Current Affairs Series Publishing House has newly compiled two pamphlets on the Korean question, which have been published by Xinhua Bookstore. These are:
    
    One, "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression in Asia, The Korean People Fight for National Reunification" (Xinhua Current Affairs Series, One)
    
    Two, "Propaganda Handbook Against American Imperialist Aggression in Taiwan and Korea" (First Collection)
    
    The first book contains four parts: The first and second parts contain speeches and statements by Chairman Mao, Foreign Minister Zhou, and the Soviet government regarding Truman's statement, the Security Council's resolution, and American imperialist armed intervention in Korea, mainly documentary materials; General Kim Il-sung's broadcast speech calling on all Korean people to fight for a just war; and several People's Daily editorials analyzing the Korean war situation and exposing the truth about American imperialists instigating the Korean civil war. The third part is about the Korean people's movement for peaceful reunification of the country before the outbreak of this war, as well as materials about how American imperialists implemented a criminal colonial policy in South Korea and how the South Korean people bravely fought for national reunification and independence. The fourth part introduces the overview of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the achievements in various aspects of economic and cultural construction.
    
    The latter book includes some important documentary materials from the former book and two pieces of reference material. It also includes two important speeches and statements by Kim Il-sung and Park Heon-young on July 8, which were not included in the former book (the materials in the former book ended on July 7). This is a 64-page booklet, about 20,000 words, and easy to carry.
