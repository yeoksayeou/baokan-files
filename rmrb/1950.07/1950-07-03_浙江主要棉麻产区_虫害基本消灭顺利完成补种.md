Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 25th—Farmers in the main cotton and hemp producing areas of Zhejiang Province, under the leadership of the People's Government, have universally carried out pest control and seedling replanting in the cotton fields. Zhejiang planted more cotton this year, but the seedling pests were serious; in addition, due to excessive autumn rain last year, the cotton seeds were not mature enough, so the germination rate this year was generally only 30% to 50%. In order to remedy this serious situation and ensure and strive to increase the yield of cotton and hemp, the people's governments at all levels have launched a campaign to eliminate pests and replant seedlings in the past month. As of now, the main cotton and hemp producing areas of Yuyao, Cixi, Xiaoshan, and Hang County have all caught insects four times, and the pests have been basically eliminated. In terms of checking seedlings and replanting, with the second issuance of seeds by the People's Government and the adjustment of seeds among farmers, replanting has also been successfully completed. For example, the seedling shortage rate in the cotton fields of Tongchao Township, Yuyao County, reached 50%, and the seeds used for replanting reached more than 7,000 jin within ten days. In Guan Cheng District, Cixi County, the seedling shortage rate of more than 50,000 mu of cotton fields reached 70%. The People's Government then re-lent more than 53,000 jin of seeds and led the farmers to complete the replanting. After completing the pest control and replanting work, cotton farmers in various places have now begun to apply fertilizer to the cotton fields.

　　浙江主要棉麻产区
    虫害基本消灭顺利完成补种
    【新华社杭州二十五日电】浙江省各主要棉、麻产区的农民，在人民政府领导下普遍进行了棉田的除虫和补苗。浙江今年种棉较多，但幼苗虫害严重；又因去年秋雨过多，棉籽成熟程度不够，所以今年发芽率一般仅有百分之三十到百分之五十。为着补救这一严重情况，保证并争取提高棉、麻产量，各级人民政府一月来领导农民展开了除虫补苗的运动。截至目前，主要棉、麻产区余姚、慈溪、萧山、杭县等地都已捉过四遍虫，虫害已基本上消灭。在查苗补种方面，经人民政府二次贷发种籽及农民之间的调剂种籽，补种亦已顺利完成。如余姚县同朝乡棉田缺苗率达百分之五十，在十天内补种所用种籽即达七千余斤。慈溪县观城区五万多亩棉田缺苗率达百分之七十，人民政府乃再次贷放种籽五万三千余斤，领导农民完成了补种。各地棉农在完成除虫补苗工作以后，现已开始给棉田追施肥料。
