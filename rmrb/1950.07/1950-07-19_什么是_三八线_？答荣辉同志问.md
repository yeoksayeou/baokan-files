　　What is the "38th Parallel"?
　　Reply to Comrade Ronghui
　　Editor:
　　Recently, news reports about the Korean War often mention the "38th Parallel." What exactly is the origin of the "38th Parallel"? Why is Korea divided into two parts, north and south, with the "38th Parallel" as the boundary?
　　Comrade Ronghui:
　　In July 1945, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain made the following decision at the Potsdam Conference: the 38th parallel north latitude would be the dividing line between the Soviet and American armies in the Korean war zone. The area south of the 38th parallel north latitude was the American defense zone, and the area north of the 38th parallel north latitude was the Soviet defense zone. This is the origin of the so-called "38th Parallel."
　　Obviously, the "38th Parallel" is temporary and should be abolished with the end of the Soviet and American occupation period. It has no long-term political binding force on the Korean people. Because Korea is a single country, the common life of the Korean people in political, economic, and cultural aspects cannot be forcibly divided into two parts by the "38th Parallel." The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in December 1945 decided on the principle of establishing an independent and unified Korean democratic state. However, American imperialism undermined the correct decision of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers and tried its best to obstruct the independence and unification of Korea. In South Korea, it supported the puppet regime of Syngman Rhee and actively carried out anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracies to turn Korea into its military base and colony in the Far East. In this way, the "38th Parallel" was used by the United States to create the division of Korea.
　　All the people of Korea are eagerly demanding the independence and unification of their motherland. On June 25, 1949, seventy-six patriotic political parties and social organizations in the whole of Korea established the Korean Democratic United Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, with the Workers' Party led by General Kim Il-sung as its core, and actively struggled for the unification, democracy, and independence of Korea. On June 7 this year, the Korean Democratic United Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland once again called for peaceful reunification, calling on all the Korean people to commemorate the fifth anniversary of "August 15th" with the peaceful reunification of the motherland. However, American imperialism and its puppet Syngman Rhee's puppet army launched a full-scale attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea north of the 38th Parallel on June 25. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was forced to take self-defense actions, repelled the puppet troops that invaded the border, and immediately launched a counter-offensive, advancing south of the 38th Parallel and achieving brilliant victories one after another. Now we can say that the "38th Parallel," which American imperialism itself used to divide Korea, was first destroyed by itself, and the "38th Parallel" only has historical significance.

### 什么是“三八线”？答荣辉同志问

　　什么是“三八线”？
    答荣辉同志问编辑同志：
    近来在报纸上关于朝鲜战争的报道常常提到“三八线”。究竟“三八线”是怎样来的？为什么要以“三八线”为界把朝鲜分成南北两部？
   荣辉荣辉同志：
    一九四五年七月，苏美英三国在波茨坦会议上作了这样的决定：北纬三十八度为苏美两军在朝鲜作战区域的分界线。北纬三十八度以南为美军防区，北纬三十八度以北为苏联军防区。这就是所谓“三八线”的来源。
    显然，“三八线”是临时性的，应当随着苏美两军占领期间的结束而撤消，对于朝鲜人民没有政治上长期的约束性。因为朝鲜本是一个国家，朝鲜人民在政治、经济、文化各方面的共同生活，都不能硬从“三八线”上分成两截。一九四五年十二月莫斯科三外长会议决定建立一个独立、统一的朝鲜民主国家的原则。但是，美国帝国主义，却破坏了莫斯科三外长会议的正确决定，竭力阻碍朝鲜的独立和统一；它在南朝鲜，扶植了李承晚傀儡政权，积极进行反苏反共的阴谋活动，要把朝鲜变成它在远东的军事基地和殖民地。这样，“三八线”就在美国的利用之下，造成朝鲜的分裂了。
    全朝鲜的人民，迫切地要求着祖国的独立和统一。一九四九年六月二十五日，全朝鲜七十六个爱国的政党和社会团体，在平壤成立了以金日成将军领导的劳动党为核心的朝鲜祖国民主主义统一战线，积极为争取朝鲜的统一、民主、独立而斗争。今年六月七日，朝鲜祖国民主主义统一战线又一次呼吁和平统一，号召全朝鲜人民以祖国的和平统一来纪念“八、一五”五周年。可是，美国帝国主义和它的傀儡李承晚的伪军，却在六月二十五日发动了对三八线以北的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全面进攻。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国被迫采取了自卫行动，击退了侵入边境的伪军，并且立即转入了反攻，向三八线以南推进，节节获得辉煌的胜利。现在我们可以说美国帝国主义自己用以分裂朝鲜的“三八线”是他自己首先摧毁的，“三八线”也就只有历史上的意义了。
