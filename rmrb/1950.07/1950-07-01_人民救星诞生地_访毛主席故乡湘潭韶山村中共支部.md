　　Birthplace of the People's Savior
　　Visiting the CCP Branch in Shaoshan Village, Xiangtan, Hometown of Chairman Mao

　　I.

　　In the autumn grain requisition of the new district in 1949, a miraculous record appeared - a village concentrated its public grain into storage within two days, not only without a single grain of arrears but also exceeding the task by more than a hundred dan. This village is Shaoshan Village in Xiangtan, Hunan—Chairman Mao’s hometown.

　　Walking into the newly liberated Shaoshan Village, the farmers surrounded you like welcoming relatives, asking all sorts of questions. The elders happily recounted stories of the Great Revolution era, pointing out: "This is where Chairman Mao led everyone to hold meetings." "Chairman Mao studied in that room!"

　　The warm comfort made you feel like returning to your own hometown. When General Wang Zhen's troops crossed the Yangtze River on a southern expedition, they advanced alone deep into enemy territory. During the thousands of miles of the journey, they marched continuously every day and fought continuously. The commanders and fighters urgently needed rest, even if it was for a short time. When the troops entered the vicinity of Shaoshan, this wish was fulfilled. The Shaoshan branch and other underground party comrades cleverly used every means to confuse and fool the enemy, allowing the troops to have a week of quiet rest.

　　II.

　　The history of the Shaoshan branch is a tortuous and arduous struggle.

　　In 1925, Chairman Mao returned to Shaoshan Village to organize and educate the peasants. He started by establishing the "National Humiliation Society" (a mass patriotic organization). In less than half a year, on this basis, he developed and established a party branch—personally sowing the seeds of revolution. For more than twenty years, the reactionaries exhausted all means to destroy it, but they could not cut off its growth and progress.

　　During the Great Revolution, the Shaoshan branch grew to dozens of members, leading and mobilizing the peasants of the entire township. Using this as a base, it launched large-scale peasant movements in Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Ningxiang, and other counties. After the Ma-Ri Incident, they organized guerrilla forces to resist the armed suppression of the reactionary chieftain Xu Kexiang. The armed struggle failed, and party leaders such as Mao Xinmei and Pang Shukan sacrificed themselves. Unarmed peasants were killed or imprisoned simply for being members of the Peasants' Association. But the ferocity of the reactionaries did not frighten the peasants of Shaoshan Village, which had a deep revolutionary influence. After Mao Xinmei's sacrifice, he left behind five children aged two to fourteen for his wife. Her answer to the reactionaries was: to dedicate the two older sons to the revolution within four years and send them to work for the party's underground organizations in Shanghai. The thatched cottage of the veteran comrade Mao Yueqiu also showed the strong will of the peasants. Mao Yueqiu had originally fled to the shore of Dongting Lake, but when the suppression eased slightly, he quietly returned home. The house had been demolished by the reactionaries, leaving only a few walls; but he was not discouraged and built a shed on the opposite mountain to live in. While continuing secret revolutionary propaganda, he rebuilt his thatched cottage. When the party's activities became active again, this thatched cottage became a place for revolutionaries to gather and a confidential organ for the party's training courses.

　　Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Yuanyao and Mao Tefu (Mao Xinmei's eldest son) returned to their hometown one after another. After the War of Resistance, they contacted the party organization in Changsha and began to reorganize and rebuild the Shaoshan branch. They used legal organizational forms such as small libraries, adult night schools, and primary school teacher forums to spread revolutionary ideas and theories of resistance, and to inspire the people's fighting spirit. Many educated youths, under the influence of the party, rushed to Yan'an and the New Fourth Army. The party's work also progressed smoothly, developing from one branch to two branches, and establishing a district committee organization.

　　The growth of progressive forces attracted the attention of the reactionary elements. One batch after another of special agents came to Shaoshan Village to conduct "surprise inspections." Then came the "Pingjiang Massacre" and the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941. The reactionaries intensified their destruction of the underground party. Under the instructions of the higher-level party, the exposed members of the Shaoshan branch were all withdrawn behind enemy lines, and the party organization turned to more secret activities.

　　The special agents kept a close eye on Qingxi Township and Shaoshan Village. One "cleansing campaign" after another checked household registration, and two or three people could not talk together. Two intelligence stations were also set up in Shaoshan, and special agents patrolled back and forth.

　　This was a severe test for revolutionaries. Mao Fuzhu, the outstanding son of the peasants and a staunch Communist Party member, led the district committee and the branch in adhering to the struggle. The special agents' strict surveillance made the party's transportation and liaison particularly important and dangerous. Li Xunqi, who supported his mother by doing odd jobs, took on this task. Life and work sometimes conflicted, but when the party's letters were handed over to Li Xunqi, he said, "My mother won't starve to death if she doesn't eat for a day, how can the party's task not be completed." Once, the organization asked Li Xunqi to go to Changsha to deliver an urgent document. Special agents and traitors were checking very strictly along the way, and the danger was great. His mother was lying in bed with a severe illness. He confessed the aftermath to his comrades. He said: "If I don't come back in a week, don't expect me. If my mother dies, bury her for me!" He walked towards Changsha without hesitation. The party members fought against difficulties so firmly and selflessly.

　　What power made Li Xunqi so strong? He said: "The revolution will always be victorious! If I die, others will do it. The Communist Party will not be uprooted!"

　　III.

　　In its daily struggles, the Shaoshan branch gradually realized the importance of controlling the enemy's township and bao organizations and carrying out legal struggles well.

　　After 1944, under the guidance of Comrade Zhou Li of the Provincial Party Committee, a series of struggles to disintegrate the puppet township and bao organizations were launched with the Shaoshan branch as the core.

　　The puppet township chief Tang Bokun's excessive apportionment of grain and money, and his embezzlement and self-enrichment, aroused opposition from the majority of peasants and some gentry. The branch took the opportunity to mobilize the masses to expose Tang's embezzlement, creating anti-Tang public opinion; on the one hand, they sent people to the county to sue him, overthrowing Tang Bokun, and electing Guo Lubin, who sympathized with the revolution, and Pang Zhuzhong, a revolutionary intellectual (who was a nominal Kuomintang member at the time, and later joined the Communist Party) as deputy township chiefs. They won the first round of victory. At this time, on the one hand, they further strived to unite the better bao chiefs and elect out the worst bao chiefs through Pang Zhuzhong's legal status; on the other hand, they went deep into the reactionary Three People's Principles Youth League to actively carry out disintegration work. Under the influence of the progressive youth Zhong Yaofu (who later joined the party), they strived to win over the youths who had gone astray to the revolution, isolating the reactionary leaders. The Three People's Principles Youth League once organized a guerrilla force of more than twenty people, which did not fight the Japanese but only harassed the local area, arousing opposition from people in society and dissatisfaction from the members. When the time was right, Zhong Yaofu encouraged the youths to propose: "If we don't resist Japan, everyone will oppose us, it's meaningless to do it, it's better to divide the guns and disband." As a result, the progressive youths got eleven guns, five guns were distributed to their homes, and only two guns fell into the hands of reactionary elements. The Three People's Principles Youth League was crushed.

　　The special agent Cheng Ji'an went to the Kuomintang County Party Headquarters to inform that Pang Zhuzhong was a "suspect." Because Pang Zhuzhong was nominally a Kuomintang member and had the support of the masses, the reactionaries were inconvenient to act rashly and attempted to elect Pang out through election methods. The branch had done a good job in winning over the bao chiefs beforehand. In the election, they also united the enlightened gentry and gained the support of some upper-level elements, gaining a majority. Pang Zhuzhong was elected again. At this time, the reactionary elements were furious and announced that the election in Qingxi Township was invalid, and forcibly sent a man named Zuo Jiantang to be the township chief. Targeting the psychology of the majority of people in the township, the branch put forward the slogan "Oppose outsiders becoming township chiefs." On the one hand, they mobilized hundreds of peasants to demonstrate and prevent Zuo Jiantang from taking office; on the other hand, the enlightened gentry Mao Guoqiao came forward to negotiate with the puppet government, retaining Pang Zhuzhong as the deputy township chief. The struggle persisted for several months, and Zuo Jiantang never came to Qingxi Township.

　　The special agents were unwilling to give up and instigated the "Justice Army" (the Kuomintang's special agent armed forces) to encircle and suppress Shaoshan. The branch was prepared and worked within the "Justice Army," sabotaging their encirclement and suppression plan. The special agents colluded with the Kuomintang 73rd Army and sent people to Shaoshan to scout, searching several times without any results.

　　In the continuous legal struggles, the party's ranks grew stronger day by day. The number of party members in the entire township, with the Shaoshan branch as the core, increased from twenty or thirty to more than one hundred; and by using the legal form of the township government's armed forces, they controlled more than thirty guns.

　　The control of the township and bao organizations greatly facilitated the struggle against conscription and grain requisition. In the first year that the revolutionary forces controlled the township and bao organizations alone, more than 300 young men in Shaoshan Village avoided being arrested.

　　When the news of the victory of the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River and heading south reached Shaoshan, the old people were so excited that they forgot the fatigue of farming; the young people could no longer bear it, and more than 100 people rushed into the People's Guerrilla. The young peasant Mao Youlian hastened to tend the crops, build melon sheds, and arrange his family affairs properly, and then carried his baggage and went to the guerrilla.

　　IV.

　　In August 1949, the day that the people of Shaoshan had been looking forward to day and night for twenty-five years finally arrived. At this time, the People's Liberation Army was advancing towards western Hunan, southern Hunan, and the two Guangdongs. They caressed the scars all over their bodies for more than twenty years and used their greatest strength to support the People's Liberation Army passing through the area. This impoverished village automatically raised 80,000 catties of military grain for the troops in just a few days.

　　The autumn requisition began. The landlord of Yongyiting in the neighboring village said: "Shaoshan is a poor place, and the land tax before liberation was dragged on for three or four years. How can they complete the task now?" But the party and people of Shaoshan thought in their hearts: "In the Kuomintang era, we resisted grain, but today it is our own world, we must complete the task." So, more than 50 party members were divided into eight groups to lead the peasants to investigate the situation, publicize policies, squeeze out the landlords' black fields, and specifically organized the transportation forces, completing the grain requisition task in excess within two days.

　　"We are the people of Chairman Mao's hometown!" "Our branch was personally founded by Chairman Mao." This infinite glory has inspired the party and people of Shaoshan to become an irresistible force for many years. Precisely because of this, when the anti-Japanese people's armed forces cooperated with the army in advancing south before liberation, more than 100 young people from this small village participated in this action; in the grain requisition and support, this village showed such outstanding achievements; not long after liberation, a peasant family like Mao Haiming appeared. Mao Haiming's family of thirteen, except for his old mother and young grandson, all eleven people participated in the People's Liberation Army, the Peasants' Association, the Women's Federation, and the Youth League.

　　After the rent reduction movement, under the leadership of the branch, the people of Shaoshan happily engaged in construction with their working hands. The dazzling red flag hanging in the Peasants' Association, sent by the Xiangtan People's Comfort Delegation, "Birthplace of the People's Savior," will forever inspire them to move forward.

　　人民救星诞生地
    访毛主席故乡湘潭韶山村中共支部
    力文·若嘉·方堤
    一
    一九四九年新区秋季征粮中，出现了一个奇迹似的纪录——有个村两天中，将公粮集中归仓，不但没有一粒尾欠，而且超过任务一百多担。这村庄是湖南湘潭韶山村——毛主席的家乡。
    走进新解放的韶山村，农民们象迎接亲人似地围着你问长问短。老人们高兴地讲着大革命时代的故事，给你指点着：“这里是毛主席领导大家开会的地方。”“毛主席在那个房间读书啊！”
    亲切的抚慰，使你象回到自己的家乡。王震将军的部队渡江南征时，孤军挺进敌区。数千里征途，每日连续不断地行军，连续不断地战斗。指战员们迫切需要休息，即使是时间很短。当部队进入韶山附近时，这愿望便实现了。韶山支部和其他地下党同志巧妙地用尽一切办法，迷惑、愚弄敌人，使部队得到一个星期安静的休整。
    二
    韶山支部的历史，是一部曲折的、艰苦不屈的斗争史。
    一九二五年毛主席回到韶山村，组织教育农民。开始是建立“雪耻会”（群众性的爱国组织）。不到半年，就在这个基础上，发展和建立了党的支部——亲手播下了革命种子。二十多年来反动派用尽一切方法摧残它，但不能断绝它的生长与前进。
    大革命中，韶山支部发展到数十名党员，领导与发动全乡农民，并以此为基点，掀起了湘潭、湘乡、宁乡等县的广大规模的农民运动。马日事变后，他们又组织了游击武装，来对抗反动头子许克祥的武装镇压。武装斗争失败了，党的领导者毛新梅、庞淑侃等同志牺牲了。手无寸铁的农民，仅仅因为是农协会员，有的被杀掉了，有的被抓进了监牢。但是反动派的凶恶并没有把革命影响深厚的韶山村的农民吓倒。毛新梅同志牺牲了，留给妻子的是两岁到十四岁的五个孩子。她对反动派的回答是：在四年内把较大的两个儿子奉献给革命，送到上海党的地下机关工作。老同志毛月秋的茅屋，也显示了农民坚强的意志。毛月秋原来逃到了洞庭湖滨，等扼杀的风声稍松，他便又悄悄回家。家已被反动派拆得只剩下几个墙垛；但他没有灰心，在对面山上搭了个敞棚安身。他一面继续秘密进行革命宣传，一面重建起他的茅屋。当党的活动又趋活跃的时候，这茅屋又成为革命者活动的场所，和党的训练班的机密机关。
    抗日战争爆发前，毛远耀、毛特夫（毛新梅的大儿子）先后返回家乡。抗战后，他们在长沙和党的组织取得联系，又着手整顿和重建韶山支部。并利用小型图书馆、成人夜校、小学教师座谈会等合法组织形式，来传播革命思想、抗战理论，鼓舞人民的斗争热情。不少知识青年在党的影响下，奔向延安和新四军。党的工作也顺利展开，由一个支部发展了两个分支，建立了区委会的组织。
    进步势力的生长，引起了反动分子的注意。一批又一批的特务，来到韶山村进行“突击检查”。接着发生了“平江惨案”和一九四一年的皖南事变。反动派对地下党的摧残更加紧了。在上级党的指示下，韶山支部暴露了的党员都撤到了敌后，党的组织，转入更秘密的活动。
    特务们一直注视着清溪乡，注视着韶山村。一次又一次的“清乡”查户口，两三人不能在一起谈话。在韶山还设立了两个情报站，特务们来往巡查。
    这是对革命者严重考验的时候。农民优秀的儿子、坚强的共产党员毛甫珠领导着区委和支部坚持着斗争。特务们的严密监视，党的交通联络显得格外重要而危险了，靠做零工来养活母亲的李勋启担当起这一任务。生活与工作有时发生矛盾，但当党的信件交给李勋启的时候，他说：“母亲一天不吃饭饿不死，党的任务怎能不完成。”有一次，组织上让李勋启去长沙送一封紧急文件，沿途特务、汉奸查得很紧，危险很大。他的母亲正躺在床上生着很厉害的病。他向同志交待着后事。他说：“我一星期不回来，就别指望我了。母亲万一死了，大家替我埋葬吧！”他毫不犹疑地走向了长沙。党员们是如此坚定、忘我地向困难搏斗着。
    什么力量使得李勋启这样坚强呢？他说：“革命总会胜利！我死了，也有别人干。共产党是不会断根的！”
    三
    韶山支部在日常斗争中，日渐认识到控制敌人的乡保组织与搞好合法斗争的重要。
    一九四四年以后，在省委周礼同志的指导下，以韶山支部为核心，展开了一系列瓦解伪乡保组织的斗争。
    伪乡长唐伯坤过重的摊派粮款，贪污自肥，引起广大农民和部分绅士的反对。支部便趁机发动群众，揭发唐的贪污事实，造成反唐舆论；一面派人去县上告状，打倒了唐伯坤，选上同情革命的郭麓宾、革命知识分子庞柱中（当时是挂名的国民党员，后来加入共产党）为正副乡长。赢得了第一回合的胜利。这时他们便一方面通过庞柱中的合法地位，进一步争取团结较好的保长和选掉最坏的保长；一面深入到反动的三青团内部，积极展开瓦解工作。在进步青年钟耀夫（后来入党）的影响下，争取误入歧途的青年们向革命靠拢，孤立了反动头目。三青团曾组织了一个二十多人的游击武装，不打日本只骚扰地方，引起社会人士的反对和团员的不满。时机到了，钟耀夫鼓动青年们提出：“不抗战，人人反对，干的没意思，不如分枪散伙。”结果，进步青年分到十一枝，五枝枪分散回家，只有两枝枪落在反动分子的手里。三青团被摧垮了。
    特务分子成吉安到国民党县党部告密说庞柱中是“嫌疑分子”。因为庞柱中名义上是国民党员，又有群众支持，反动派不便冒然行动，企图用选举办法把庞选掉。支部事前已做好争取保长的工作，在选举中又团结了开明士绅，获得部分上层分子的支持，掌握了多数，庞柱中又当选了。这时反动分子恼羞成怒，不顾一切地宣布清溪乡选举无效，硬派一个名叫左建塘的当乡长。支部针对着全乡多数人的心理，提出“反对外乡人当乡长”的口号。一面发动数百农民举行示威，阻挡左建塘到任；一面由开明绅士毛国桥出面去伪政府交涉，保留庞柱中当副乡长。斗争坚持了数个月，左建塘始终没有来到清溪乡。
    特务分子不甘心，又怂恿“正义军”（国民党的特务武装）进剿韶山。支部早有准备，在“正义军”内部作了工作，破坏了他们的进剿计划。特务分子又勾结国民党七十三军，派人到韶山侦察，搜查了几次也毫无结果。
    在连续的合法斗争中，党的队伍日渐壮大了。以韶山支部为核心的全乡党员由二三十名发展到百余名；并利用乡公所武装的合法形式，掌握了三十多支枪。
    对乡保组织的控制，大大便利了反抽丁反征粮的斗争。仅在革命力量控制乡保组织的第一年，韶山村便有三百多名壮丁避免被抓走。
    当解放军渡江南下的胜利消息传到韶山的时候，老人们兴奋得忘记了耕作的疲劳；青年们再也耐不住了，一百多人争先涌进人民游击队。青年农民毛友连加紧弄庄稼、搭瓜棚、把家事安排停当，也背起包袱找游击队去了。
    四
    一九四九年八月，二十五年韶山人民朝夕期待着的日子终于到来了。这时，解放大军正在向湘西，湘南，两广挺进。他们抚摸着二十多年来的遍体伤痕，用最大的力量支援着过境的解放军。这个穷困的村庄，短短几天中，自动为部队筹借了八万斤军粮。
    秋征开始了。邻村永义亭的地主说：“韶山那个穷地方，解放前的田赋一拖就三四年，现在他们怎能完成任务？”但韶山的党和人民心里在想：“国民党时我们是抗粮，今天是我们自己的天下，我们一定要完成任务。”于是，五十多个党员分成八组，分别领导农民调查情况，宣传政策，把地主的黑田挤出来，又具体地组织了运输力量，以两天时间超额完成了征粮任务。
    “我们是毛主席家乡的人民！”“我们的支部是毛主席亲手奠基的。”这无限的光荣，多年来鼓舞着韶山党和人民成为一支不可抗拒的力量。正因为这样，当解放前，敌后人民武装配合大军南进的时候，这个不大的村庄才会有一百多名青年参加了这一行动；在征粮支前中，这个村庄又表现了那么突出的成绩；解放不久就出现了象毛海明这样的农家。毛海明一家十三口人，除老母亲和小孙子外，十一个人全都分别参加了解放军、农协会、妇女会和青年团。
    减租运动后，韶山人民在支部的领导下，愉快地用劳动的双手，从事着建设。那幅挂在农民协会里的、湘潭各界人民慰问团送来的，“人民救星诞生地”的耀眼的红旗，将永远鼓舞着他们前进。
