　　Striving for a Better Life
    The Reality of Farmers' Labor After Land Reform in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Shi Yan
    Land reform has brought unprecedentedly favorable conditions to agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing. Farmers, freed from feudal exploitation, are cultivating the land with unprecedented enthusiasm.

　　When the land reform movement was still underway last winter and this spring, the farmers had already begun preparing fertilizer. From the slack season last winter to before sowing this spring, the roads connecting the city with the suburbs have been constantly filled with carts hauling ash and ditch mud. Every village had many people collecting manure every morning. Therefore, more fertilizer was applied this year than in previous years. For example, Xin Si Village has a total of 3,011 mu of land. In previous years, an average of two cartloads of fertilizer were applied per mu, but this year the average was three and a half cartloads per mu. In the past, wheat fields generally did not receive green manure, but this year most of them received base fertilizer and topdressing. In the past, farmers applied two cartloads of fertilizer to their own land but only one cartload to the land rented from landlords; this year, fertilizer was applied equally to both their own land and the land used from the state.

　　During the spring plowing and sowing season, most farmers labored in the fields from morning till night. Liu Wenquan, a farmer in Hei Ta Village, worked all day clearing the land, and did not rest even when his hands were blistered. When the farmers of Liu Lang Zhuang were digging drainage ditches in their village, their intense and enthusiastic mood moved a passing peddler to say, "It would be difficult to hire such good labor even with good money." In order to create a better life for themselves in the future, the farmers displayed a high degree of perseverance and even saved some funds from their insufficient rations to invest in the land. For example, Zhen Du Shi from Shuang Huai Shu Village saved 400 jin of corn from the land reform distribution. She ate bran and wild vegetables to get through the winter, and this spring used the corn to convert her five mu of dry land into paddy fields. There were many similar efforts to improve the land. In Shuang Huai Shu Village alone, 71 poor and hired peasant households converted more than 80 mu of dry land into paddy fields and more than 50 mu of dry land and 90 mu of paddy fields into garden plots.

　　Land reform has improved the farmers' enthusiasm for production and creativity. They have come up with various ways to increase production. For example, an old farmer from Liu Lang Zhuang introduced his effective experience in eliminating locusts to the entire village (details in the June 10th, page 3 issue of this newspaper), which reduced the loss of 200 shi of rice this year. In mid-May of this year, wheat sawfly outbreaks occurred extensively in the suburban wheat fields. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the farmers created a winnowing basket method to kill the sawflies and eradicated them all within a week, protecting more than 300,000 mu of wheat fields in the entire suburban area.

　　In terms of water conservancy, many villages have dug new wells and repaired old wells after land reform. Xiao Hong Men Village alone has dug 42 new wells. Many drainage ditches have also been dug. In the northern suburbs alone, 32 administrative villages have dug more than 10,000 zhang of ditches. When land was in the hands of landlords, agricultural equipment could not be fully utilized. For example, Shuang Huai Shu Village has a total of 200 wells. Before land reform, most of them were occupied by landlords and could only irrigate 2,000 mu of land. After land reform, the wells were used rationally, expanding the irrigated area by 1,000 mu, which can increase production by about 120,000 jin of corn per year.

　　After land reform, the masses have recognized the shamefulness of parasitism and the glory of labor. As Wang Lu, a farmer from Jiu Jian Fang, said, "It is more unbearable to let others say that you have wasted the land by not working than to be beaten." Therefore, the labor force in agricultural production has increased significantly. In the past, idlers who drank and gambled have also participated in labor this year under the supervision of the masses. Although women also participated in agricultural labor in the past, their number was small. Land reform has raised their awareness, and they no longer feel ashamed to go to the fields. Not only a large number of women participated in light labor such as weeding and seedling transplanting, but also many women have joined in major labor such as delivering manure and hoeing seedlings. Half of the women in Shi Ba Li Dian have entered production. Seventy percent of the women in Gao Jing have participated in labor. After the landlords' land was confiscated, they lost the basis for exploitation, and were given the same share of land as the farmers. They must also labor like the farmers to live. Therefore, most landlords have begun to participate in agricultural production. According to a survey, among 69 landlord households in Hei Ta and Shuang Huai Shu villages, 62 landlord households and 82 laborers have participated in labor. Due to the increase in labor, this year's agricultural production has achieved intensive cultivation. In the past, the land was only plowed once before sowing autumn crops, but this year most of it was plowed twice; wheat fields were generally not hoeed, but this year they were universally hoeed once; autumn crops were hoeed twice after wheat in the past, but this year they have been hoeed twice before wheat. The farmers have all guaranteed to hoe once more than in previous years, so as to achieve "no weeds in the fields."

　　With these favorable conditions, although land reform has just ended, farmers lack production funds, draft animals and agricultural tools are insufficient, and the floods last autumn have caused some farmers to lack food, there are many difficulties in production. However, with the strong support of the People's Government and the efforts of the masses, it is possible for the suburbs of Beijing to complete the task of increasing production by 10% this year, just like the old liberated areas, laying a good foundation for future development.

　　However, there are still several issues that need to be resolved:

　　(1) The issue of labor mutual aid. At present, most farmers are not accustomed to "collective labor" and are unwilling to join mutual aid teams, preferring to work individually. Individual work can certainly lead to prosperity, but more importantly, through "organizing labor mutual aid," the vast majority of farmers can "gradually develop from individual to collective." Therefore, the erroneous view that "the suburbs have a large labor force and do not need mutual aid" must be corrected. However, when starting to organize labor mutual aid, one must not be impatient, pursue numbers, or focus on form; one must pay attention to substance and cultivate good typical mutual aid teams so that farmers can see the benefits of "organizing" and gradually attract them to the mutual aid teams.

　　(2) The issue of surplus labor. The suburbs have little land and many people, and the labor force in agriculture has always been sufficient. After land reform, many women have joined the labor force, most landlords have also participated in labor, and some poor non-agricultural laborers have also been allocated land, which has increased the labor force in agricultural production even more. Moreover, with the increase in mutual aid teams, the issue of surplus labor has become increasingly prominent. The fundamental solution to this problem still depends on the development of urban industrial construction, but in the meantime, it should be addressed by developing sideline occupations and encouraging farmers to cultivate intensively and improve land to absorb surplus labor.

　　(3) The issue of relieving the concerns of rich peasants. At present, some rich peasants still have concerns, fearing to carry the burden of "exploitation," dare not hire workers, fear another land reform, and fear more burdens. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the policy that those who increase production through intensive cultivation will not bear more burdens, and those who reduce production due to laziness will not bear fewer burdens; protect the private property rights of all classes after land reform, and deal with those who infringe on private property rights according to law; and when labor disputes occur between agricultural workers and employers, they must be resolved according to the principle of "benefit to both labor and capital." Through the specific implementation of the above policies, gradually dispel the rich peasants' erroneous understanding.

　　(4) Restore rural lending relations. After land reform, rural lending relations have not yet been restored. Without rural financial activity, production development will be hindered. Therefore, the People's Government's policy of free lending should be widely and deeply publicized among the masses, reasonable claims should be protected, and old debt disputes among the masses should be resolved from the long-term interests of the broad masses.

　　为美好生活而奋斗
    京郊土改后农民劳动实况
    石岩
    土地改革给京郊农业生产带来了空前的有利条件，摆脱了封建剥削的农民，正以前所未有的劳动热忱进行耕作。
    当去冬今春土地改革运动还在进行时，农民们就已开始准备肥料。从去冬农闲到今春播种前，市内通四郊的大道上，一直没有断过拉炉灰、拉沟泥的大车。每天早晨拾粪的人各村都很多。因此，今年普遍地比往年多上了粪。如辛四村共三千零十一亩地，往年平均每亩上两车粪，今年每亩平均上到三车半。往年一般麦地不抓青苗粪，今年大部都上了底沟子粪、苗了青。往年农民自己的地上两车粪，租地主的地只上一车，今年不论是自己的地或使用国家的地都一样上了粪。
    春耕播种期间，大部分的农民从早到晚都在地里劳动。黑塔村农民刘文全，整天收拾土地，手都磨破了还不休息。六郎庄农民挖本村排水沟时，紧张热烈的情绪，感动得一位过路的小商贩说：“好钱也难雇这样好的工”。为了创造自己未来的美好生活，农民发挥了高度的坚苦精神，在口粮不足的情况下还节省出一些资金投到土地上。如双槐树村的甄杜氏，把土地改革时分的四百斤玉米留起来，自己吃糠咽菜度过寒冬，今春把玉米拿出，用来改变自己分得的五亩旱地为水地。类似这样努力改良土地的很多，仅双槐树村就有七十一户贫雇农改变了八十多亩旱地为水地，变五十多亩旱地和九十多亩水地为园子地。
    土地改革，提高了农民的生产积极性与创造性。他们想出各种办法增加生产。如六郎庄一老农，把消灭蝗虫的有效经验介绍给全村（详情见本报六月十日三版），使今年减少了二百石大米的损失。今年五月中旬，郊区麦田普遍发生了麦叶蜂，在人民政府领导下，农民创造簸箕兜杀法，一周之内，全部扑灭，保护了全郊区的三十多万亩麦田。
    在兴修水利方面，土地改革后各村普遍打新井，修旧井，仅小红门一村就打了新井四十二眼。挖排水沟的也很多，仅北郊就有三十二个行政村共挖沟万余丈。土地在地主手中时，农业设备是不能充分利用的。如双槐树共有水井二百眼，土改前，大部为地主所占有，只能浇地二千亩。土改以后，水井得到合理使用，扩大浇地面积一千亩，每年约可增产十二万斤玉米。
    经过土改，群众都认识了寄生之可耻和劳动光荣，正像九间房农民王禄所说：“不劳动，把地荒了，让人家说，比打脖子拐还难受”。因此，农业生产中的劳动力增加很多。往年喝酒耍钱的二流子，在群众监视下，今年也参加了劳动。往年妇女虽也有参加农业劳动的，但为数不多。土地改革提高了她们的觉悟，她们不再感到下地寒伧了。不仅拔草、?苗等轻劳动有大批妇女参加，就是送粪、锄苗等主要劳动，也增加了许多妇女。十八里店已有半数妇女投入生产。高井有百分之七十的妇女参加了劳动。地主的土地被没收后，失掉了剥削的依据，分得了和农民同样的一份土地，也必须和农民同样劳动才能生活，因此，一般地主都开始参加了农业生产。据调查，黑塔、双槐树两村六十九户地主中，已有六十二户地主、八十二个劳动力参加了劳动。由于劳动力的增加，今年的农业生产作到了精耕细作。往年大秋作物播种前，地只犁一遍，今年大部翻了二犁；麦地一般不锄，今年普遍锄了一遍；大秋作物都是麦后才锄二遍，今年麦前已锄过二遍，农民都保证要比往年多锄一遍，作到“地里不见草”。
    有了这些有利条件，虽然土改刚刚结束，农民生产资金缺乏，耕畜农具不足，加以去秋涝灾使部分农民缺乏口粮，生产中的困难很多，但经过人民政府的大力扶植和群众的努力，使今年京郊也可能和老区一样的完成增产一成的任务，为今后的发展打下良好的基础。
    但是目前还有需要解决的几个问题：
    （一）劳动互助问题。目前大多数农民还不习惯于“集体劳动”，不愿意参加互助组，愿意单干。单干固然也可以生产致富，但更重要的是经过“组织劳动互助”，使绝大多数农民“由个体逐步向集体方向发展”。因此，“郊区劳动力多，不需要互助”的错误观点必须予以纠正。但在开始组织劳动互助时，决不能性急，追求数字，讲求形式；要注重实质，应培养良好的典型互助组，使农民看到“组织起来”的好处，逐步地把他们吸引到互助组里来。
    （二）剩余劳动力问题。郊区地少人多，农业上的劳动力一向够用。土地改革以后，由于很多妇女参加了劳动，地主们也大部参加了劳动，还有一些贫苦的非农业劳动者也分到了土地，使农业生产方面的劳动力更形增多。而且随着互助组的增多，剩余劳动力问题也就越来越突出。此一问题的基本解决还有待于城市工业建设的发展，而在目前应从发展副业与鼓励农民精耕细作、改良土地以吸收剩余劳动力。
    （三）解除富农顾虑问题。目前仍有部分富农存有顾虑，怕背“剥削”包袱，不敢雇工，怕再土改，怕多出负担。因此必须执行因精耕细作而增产的，不多负担，因怠惰而减产的，不少负担的政策；保护土改后各阶层的私有财产权，对于侵犯私人财产权者，应依法处理；并在农业工人与雇主发生纠纷时，必须根据“劳资两利”的原则来解决。通过具体执行上述政策，逐渐解除富农的错误认识。
    （四）恢复农村借贷关系。土改以后，农村的借贷关系迄未恢复。农村金融不活动，生产发展就要受到阻碍。因此，应在群众中广泛深入地宣传人民政府的自由借贷政策，保护合理的债权，并从广大人民的长远利益出发，来解决群众之间旧有的债务纠纷。
