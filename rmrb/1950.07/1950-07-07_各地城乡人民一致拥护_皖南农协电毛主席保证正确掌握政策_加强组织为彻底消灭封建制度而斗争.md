Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 5th: People from all walks of life in the Southern Anhui and Southern Jiangsu regions warmly support the Land Reform Law and have begun studying it.
　　The Farmers' Association of Southern Anhui District, on behalf of all farmers in the region, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao saying: The promulgation of the Land Reform Law has brought good news to millions of farmers in Southern Anhui. Every article of the Land Reform Law is entirely suited to the rural situation and the demands of the vast number of farmers in Southern Anhui. The implementation of this law in Southern Anhui will thoroughly eliminate the feudal exploitation system in the vast rural areas of Southern Anhui, and the farmers of Southern Anhui will cultivate their own land, thereby greatly increasing agricultural production. The telegram also said: We must strengthen our organization, earnestly study the Land Reform Law, deeply mobilize the peasants, guarantee the correct grasp of policies, and under your leadership and that of the Central People's Government, fight to thoroughly eliminate the feudal system. The Preparatory Committee of the Southern Anhui District Federation of Trade Unions, representing 120,000 workers in the region, stated that they would vigorously support land reform, cooperate with the vast number of peasant brothers in Southern Anhui, and jointly complete this great historical task. The Preparatory Committee stated: Abolishing the land ownership of the landlord class and developing agricultural production to pave the way for the industrialization of New China is not only the demand of the vast number of working peasants, but also the demand of our working class. The Southern Anhui District Democratic Women's Federation believes that the Land Reform Law has brought boundless happiness to the women of Southern Anhui. The implementation of the Land Reform Law will enable rural women to achieve economic liberation. The Women's Federation called on women throughout the region to strive to improve their class consciousness and political awareness through labor, study the Land Reform Law, and prepare to welcome the land reform movement in Southern Anhui after this autumn. The Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Southern Anhui District also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao saying that they would earnestly study the Land Reform Law, conduct propaganda among the masses, and actively prepare to welcome the land reform movement in Southern Anhui District after this autumn.
