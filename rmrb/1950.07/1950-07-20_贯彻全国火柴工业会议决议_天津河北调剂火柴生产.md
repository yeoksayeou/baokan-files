Implementing the Resolutions of the National Match Industry Conference
　　Tianjin and Hebei Coordinate Match Production
　　[Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: In accordance with the resolutions of the National Match Industry Conference, the Tianjin match industry has adjusted the monthly output of each factory and begun to move towards planned production.
　　The production task assigned to Tianjin by the National Match Industry Conference was 4,140 boxes per month (240 packets per box, 10 boxes per packet), a 40% reduction compared to before the adjustment. Since June 15th, the industry has held more than ten meetings and, through democratic consultation, has successfully determined the monthly production tasks of each factory. From now on, the Tianjin match industry will end the anarchic state of blind production and blind competition.
　　In order to inspect finished products, negotiate prices, and jointly purchase major raw materials to solve the main difficulties in production and sales, the industry has also decided to establish a joint production and sales committee; and plans to formally establish a joint venture company in the future. In the agreement, the factories have already established a temporary production convention, stipulating that each factory must ensure the production quota (no excess or deficiency in production), and ensure that raw materials, production, and finished products meet specifications. In order to sell the more than 17,000 boxes of matches accumulated over the past year, the industry has decided that each factory with inventory will establish a price negotiation committee to avoid low-price competition and loss of cost, or hoarding and speculation, affecting prices. In addition, the factories have made principled decisions on issues such as wages and working hours during the period of production reduction, as well as the method of dismissing redundant personnel and paying wages during work stoppages.
　　According to Li Zhongchu, chairman of the industry association: Due to the reduction in production in the Tianjin match industry and the fact that matches from Northeast China are not entering the customs as much as possible, it is expected that the production and sales of Tianjin matches will tend to normalize in one or two months, and sales will improve after the autumn harvest. Therefore, as long as we adhere to planned production, the future of the match industry is still bright.
　　[Our newspaper, Baoding News] The Industry Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a symposium of representatives from public and private match factories throughout the province from June 23rd to 26th. Based on the spirit of the resolutions of the National Match Industry Conference and in light of the current situation of the match industry in the province, it specifically discussed the current issues of production reduction, task allocation, and follow-up matters after production reduction.
　　The monthly output of the eight public and private match factories participating in the meeting was 3,890 boxes (3,438 boxes from public factories and 472 boxes from private factories). According to the production task assigned by the National Match Industry Conference, the province's production reduction quantity is nearly one-half of the original output. The meeting first unified understanding of production reduction, and then carried out task allocation. In allocating tasks, it fully demonstrated the spirit of taking into account both public and private interests, mutual assistance among the industry, and public care for private enterprises. In order to take care of the production of private factories, the public-owned Yuzhen Match Factory allocated the 120 boxes per month task specially taken care of by the Central Ministry of Light Industry to various factories. Langfang Jianhua Match Factory and Tangshan Defeng Match Factory also voluntarily stated that their own production conditions were not strong or that they had too much inventory, and gave up the right to accept tasks. The other two public-owned match factories also automatically reduced the originally assigned tasks. This enabled the tasks assigned to each private factory to exceed about twice the amount that should have been allocated.
　　The meeting resolved that each factory must accurately complete the allocated figures and ensure that the products meet the specifications stipulated by the National Match Industry Conference. Regarding the handling of some transferred workers, local trade unions are required to take into account factors such as seniority and skills, and properly resettle them by starting with ideological education; appropriate subsidies must be given to workers with financial difficulties; those who have signed collective contracts or temporary agreements shall act in accordance with the contracts.

　　贯彻全国火柴工业会议决议
    天津河北调剂火柴生产
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：天津火柴业根据全国火柴工业会议的决议，调整了各厂月产量，开始走向计划生产。
    全国火柴工业会议分配给天津的生产任务为月产四千一百四十箱（每箱二百四十包，每包十盒），较调整前减产百分之四十。六月十五日起，该业曾经召开了十余次会议，以民主协商的方式，圆满地确定了各厂每月生产任务。从此天津火柴业将结束盲目生产和盲目竞争的无政府状态。
    为了检查成品、协议售价、共同采购主要原料，以解决产销中的主要困难问题，该业又决定成立产销联营委员会；并打算将来正式成立联营公司。各厂在协议中已订立临时生产公约，规定各厂要确保生产定额（不得超额或差额生产），确保原料、生产、成品等合乎规格。为了销售一年来所积存的一万七千余箱火柴，该业确定由存货各厂成立议价委员会，以避免低价竞售，亏蚀成本，或高价居奇，影响物价。此外，各厂对减产时期的工资、工时，以及裁减冗员、停工工资发放办法等问题都作了原则性的决定。
    据该业同业公会主任委员李钟楚谈：由于天津火柴业减产和东北火柴尽量不入关，预计一、二月后天津火柴的产销即可趋向正常，秋收后销路更会好转。因此，只要坚持计划生产，火柴业的前途仍是光明的。
    【本报保定讯】河北省人民政府工业厅于六月二十三日至二十六日召开了全省公私营火柴工厂代表座谈会，根据全国火柴工业会议决议的精神，结合该省火柴业的现状，具体讨论了目前减产、任务分配及减产后的善后问题。
    参加会议的公私营八个火柴厂，月产量为三千八百九十箱（公营产三千四百三十八箱，私营产四百七十二箱）。按全国火柴工业会议分配的生产任务，全省减产数量几达原产量二分之一。会议首先统一了对减产的认识，然后进行分配任务。在分配任务时，充分表现了公私兼顾、同业互助和公营照顾私营的精神。公营汨镇火柴厂为了照顾私营各厂的生产，将中央轻工业部特别照顾该厂的每月一百二十箱任务分给各厂。廊房建华火柴厂及唐山德丰火柴厂等也自动提出自己生产条件不强或存货太多，放弃接受任务的权利。其他两家公营火柴厂也自动降低原分配的任务。这样使各私营工厂分得的任务，都超过了应分配额的一倍左右。
    会议决议各厂必须准确完成分配数字，保证产品合乎全国火柴工业会议规定的规格。对若干转业工人的处理，要求当地工会照顾到工龄、技术等条件，并从思想教育着手，妥善安置；对生活有困难的工人必须酌情发给适当补助费；有签订集体合同或临时协议者，则应依照合同办理。
