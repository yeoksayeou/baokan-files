　　The Rent Reduction Movement in the Central South Region

This spring, the Central South region launched a large-scale rent reduction movement in its rural areas. In Henan Province, rent reduction was carried out in half of the region, while the other half underwent land reform. In Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, over 80 percent of the regions vigorously launched rent reduction movements. After rent reduction, the class consciousness of the broad masses of peasants was generally raised, and they organized peasant associations one after another, creating favorable conditions for land reform work after this autumn.

Before this spring, rural areas in the Central South region had successively carried out campaigns to suppress bandits and oppose local bullies, based on different situations (including the order of liberation, conditions of cadres and the masses, etc.); among them, some advanced areas combined the victory of bandit suppression with opposing local bullies to carry out partial rent reduction work. In the areas that had undergone these movements, bandits were basically eliminated, the rule of the landlord class was overthrown, the peasant masses obtained partial economic benefits, and the peasants' consciousness was raised and initially organized. After the peasants' class consciousness was raised, they began to realize the unreasonableness of the feudal exploitation of the landlord class, and they demanded the implementation of rent reduction to improve their lives. Especially this spring, there were the following two situations: First, due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang and the cruel exploitation of the landlord class, many disasters were left to the peasants, coupled with the poor harvest due to last year's floods, since the beginning of this spring, peasants in various parts of the Central South region have generally lacked food and seeds, and their lives are difficult, making them unable to carry out spring plowing and production. The broad masses of peasants are eager to obtain food. Second, the landlord class has a large amount of grain stored but refuses to lend it to the peasants; illegal landlords are even colluding with secret agents and bandits, taking advantage of the time when the old crop is gone and the new crop is not yet ripe to spread rumors and sabotage, and even incite and threaten the peasant masses to rob public granaries, plotting riots, disrupting social order, and undermining production and construction and the rent reduction struggle. This makes the peasants' demand for rent reduction more urgent.

In order to lead the peasant masses through the spring famine, enable them to engage in spring plowing and production with peace of mind, defeat the attacks of the landlord class, and create favorable conditions for the implementation of land reform this autumn, the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee decided to launch a rent reduction movement throughout the region. The Central South Military and Political Committee adopted and promulgated the "Regulations on Rent and Interest Reduction in the Central South Region" in late February, and the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also issued the "Instructions on Launching the Rent and Rent Refund Movement to Overcome the Spring Famine and Prepare for Production" on March 1. The unprecedented rent reduction movement in the Central South region was then launched in a guided and orderly manner. After two months, the rent reduction movement came to an end at the end of May. Except for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and the areas in Henan Province where land reform was implemented, an average of more than 80 percent of the rural areas in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces carried out rent reduction. Some areas in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces also reduced rents. Peasants received 886 million jin of reduced rent grain. In the rent reduction movement, organizations such as peasant associations and militias have greatly developed. A total of 13.5 million members of peasant associations have been developed in the region. In Hubei Province, peasant associations were established in more than 13,000 villages out of more than 15,900 villages in the province, and the old baojia system was abolished in more than 13,400 villages, organizing more than 140,000 militiamen. There were more than 1.8 million members of peasant associations in Jiangxi Province, and village political power organizations were transformed in more than 35% of the province. In Changsha County, an advanced area in Hunan Province, peasant association organizations were established in all 330 bao in the county, and the old baojia system was abolished. Village political power organizations were elected by the peasants. During the movement, a large number of peasant activists emerged, and many outstanding people were promoted to working cadres, greatly enriching the district, township, and village-level political power institutions and strengthening the ties between the government and the peasant masses. According to statistics from Jiujiang, Nanchang, and other five special districts in Jiangxi Province, more than 10,000 district and township cadres were trained. The peasant masses who won the struggle rapidly increased their class consciousness, realized that they could only be liberated by following the Communist Party and the People's Government, and also increased their confidence in fighting against the landlord class. Peasants automatically came forward to protect public warehouses and assist the People's Government in transferring public grain. Because the peasants obtained grain, solved the difficulties of eating and seeds, broke the idea of ​​waiting for relief, survived the spring famine, and organized themselves for production.

The empiricist thinking methods of some working cadres hindered the development of the movement. In many areas, cadres in the rent reduction movement did not believe in and rely on the masses to boldly launch the movement, but were accustomed to the old experience of visiting the poor and asking about their sufferings, being constrained and sticking to isolated points, working in a piecemeal manner; they were not good at using the new working methods of peasant representative conferences, which limited the development of the movement. For example, in Puqi County, Hubei Province, one-third of the cadres were concentrated in a few key villages, and it took more than a month to break through one bao. In Mianyang County, the key village of Nanzhou Village prepared to spend three to five months to complete the rent reduction. This working method could not meet the requirements of the work and the demands of the masses, causing widespread dissatisfaction and anxiety among the peasant masses.

In response to the above situation, the Central South Military and Political Committee, the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the party and government leading organs at all levels, in addition to educating cadres to recognize the cunning faces of landlords and clarify the purpose of rent reduction, focused on solving the following problems in terms of policies and working methods:

First, earnestly convene people's representative conferences at all levels and widely use peasant representative conferences. At the beginning of the movement, people's governments at all counties convened people's representative conferences at all levels, and representatives from workers, peasants, enlightened gentry, troops, government agencies, and mass organizations participating in the conference jointly discussed the rent reduction work, formed a rural united front, mobilized people from all walks of life to support the peasant movement, and supported the people's government's rent reduction decrees. In this way, people from all democratic strata quickly accepted the policies of the people's government, reduced resistance, and enabled the movement to develop rapidly. Peasant representative conferences were also widely used in various places. Experience has proved that the rent reduction movement immediately took on a new look in areas where peasant representative conferences were used. For example, in the six special districts of Changsha and Shaoyang in Hunan Province, the rent reduction movement was still carried out sporadically before mid-March. After using the peasant representative conference, one-third to one-half of the region quickly became involved in the enthusiastic rent reduction movement. Up to now, about 2 million representatives have participated in the township, district, and county-level peasant representative conferences in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and some townships have held more than ten meetings. The peasant representatives are elected or invited based on different situations in various places, and after repeated reviews, bad elements are gradually cleared to achieve the purity of the representative composition. The content of the peasant representative conference is first to improve the class consciousness of the representatives, and adopt methods such as calculating exploitation accounts and complaining about suffering, so that the representatives can understand the principle of "who supports whom." Secondly, discuss the rent reduction policy and working methods, formulate plans, and make resolutions. After the meeting, the peasant representatives will organize the peasant representatives to widely and deeply convey the resolutions and lead the peasant masses to carry out rent reduction. In the process of using the peasant representative conference, some regions have also made some mistakes in formalism. For example, a small number of cadres and representatives replaced the activities of the broad masses of the people, making the main role of the peasant representative conference in contacting and organizing the peasant masses become a formality. Or the meeting was held purely to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and they could not seriously discuss and study with the representatives, resulting in continued substitution. At the same time, some regions neglected to grasp key points and create typical experiences when using peasant representative conferences. These deviations have been corrected by the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in a timely manner.

Second, the method of legal reasoning struggle was used. After correcting the phenomena of random beatings and killings in rural work that occurred before rent reduction, various places adopted the method of legal reasoning struggle in rent reduction to fight against landlords and bullies who stubbornly resisted rent reduction. Before the struggle began, the peasants had been fully brewing and fully prepared with witnesses and material evidence, and they reasoned with the stubborn landlords face to face during the struggle. Under the disclosure of the peasants with evidence, the illegal landlords were speechless and had to bow their heads and confess their guilt. After adopting this method, the peasants' class consciousness was further improved, and the rent reduction was carried out smoothly. At the same time, phenomena such as random deductions, beatings, and killings that violated policies were eliminated.

Third, anti-bullies and rent reduction were combined. In the beginning, some areas mechanically separated anti-bullies from rent reduction, staying at the stage of pure anti-bully struggle, ignoring the rent reduction requirements of the peasant masses. For example, after the cadres and masses in the Guankou District of Xishui County, Hubei Province overthrew the bully Guo Weizhou through reasoning, the peasants demanded rent reduction, but the leading cadres believed that the rent reduction work was not yet ready, and still stopped at the stage of leading the peasants to complain about their suffering and organizing work, which delayed the rent reduction movement for a month and a half. Later, the cadres realized the harm of mechanically dividing the stages, and gradually combined anti-bullies with rent reduction. When they encountered bullies in rent reduction, they immediately mobilized the peasant masses to first fight against the bullies and reduce the rent of these bullies first, politically打击(dǎjī) their reactionary arrogance, thereby influencing other landlords to obediently carry out rent reduction.

In leading the rent reduction, some deviations also occurred in individual areas and among certain working cadres. Some simply pursued rent reduction figures without paying attention to ideologically mobilizing the peasant masses. Therefore, the number of rent reduction grain on the surface was large, but in reality, the peasants were not mobilized. Many landlords delayed and resisted, reducing rent overtly but not covertly, and even had the rent reduction grain taken back by the landlords. For example, of the 27 peasant households in Wuguichang Village, Jiangbei District, Yidu, Hubei Province who received reduced rent grain, 25 were taken back by illegal landlord Zhang Ronglin. In Yuji Township, Shangcheng County, Henan Province, all 274 tenant households in the township initially thought that rent had been reduced, but after inspection, only 15 activists reduced rent. The peasant representatives of Wentang Village in Shanxian County calculated accounts for tenants day and night, forming a cadre monopoly. Peasants had ideological concerns, and returned the reduced rent grain to the landlord at night. In addition, some peasant associations adopted a closed-door policy towards middle peasants. There were even some phenomena of grabbing and detaining people at random, which violated policies. The above deviations have been corrected in a timely manner during the movement.

### 中南区的减租运动

　　中南区的减租运动
    中南区今年春天在全区农村中展开了大规模的减租运动。河南省除一半地区进行土地改革以外，另一半地区进行了减租。湖北、湖南、江西有百分之八十以上的地区蓬勃展开了减租运动。经过减租的地区，广大农民的阶级觉悟普遍提高，纷纷组织农民协会，给今年秋后的土地改革工作创造了有利条件。
    今年春季以前，中南区各省农村曾经根据不同情况（包括解放的先后，与干部、群众条件等），先后进行了剿匪与反恶霸运动；其中个别先进地区，随着剿匪的胜利、结合反恶霸进行了部分的减租工作。经过这些运动的地区，土匪基本上肃清，打垮了地主阶级当权派的统治，农民群众获得了部分的经济利益，农民觉悟提高，并且初步组织起来。农民的阶级觉悟提高以后，就开始认识地主阶级封建剥削的不合理，纷纷要求实行减租，改善生活。特别是今年春季更有下列两种情况：第一，由于国民党匪帮的长期统治，地主阶级的残酷剥削，遗留给农民许多灾难，又加以去年水灾歉收，今年入春以来，中南地区各地农民普遍缺粮缺种，生活困难，无力进行春耕生产，广大农民急于要求得到粮食。第二，地主阶级存有大批粮食，不肯借给农民；非法地主更与特务、土匪勾结一气，乘青黄不接的机会造谣破坏，甚至煽动与威胁农民群众抢劫公粮仓库，阴谋暴乱，扰乱社会治安，破坏生产建设和减租斗争。这就使农民减租的要求更迫切。
    为了领导农民群众度过春荒，安心进入春耕生产，为了打垮地主阶级的进攻，并给今秋实行土地改革创造有利条件，中南军政委员会及中共中央中南局，决定在全区范围内发动减租运动。中南军政委员会于二月下旬通过与颁布了《中南区减租减息条例》，中共中央中南局亦于三月一日发出“关于开展减租退租运动克服春荒准备生产”的指示。中南地区规模空前的减租运动，随即有领导有秩序地开展起来。前后经过两个月的时间，减租运动于五月底告一段落。除广东、广西两省及河南省实行土地改革的地区外，湖北、湖南、江西等省平均有百分之八十以上的农村进行了减租。广东、广西两省也有部分地区减了租。农民减得租粮八亿八千六百万斤。在减租运动中，农民协会和民兵等组织获得很大发展。全区农民协会会员共发展了一千三百五十万人。湖北全省一万五千九百多个村庄中，有一万三千多个村庄建立了农民协会，一万三千四百多个村庄废除了旧保甲制度，组织民兵十四万多人。江西省农民协会会员有一百八十多万人，在全省百分之三十五以上的地区改造了村政权组织。湖南省先进地区长沙县，全县三百三十个保建立了农民协会组织，并且废除了旧保甲制度，由农民民选出村政权组织。在运动中，并出现了大批农民积极分子，许多优秀分子被提拔为工作干部，大大地充实了区、乡、村各级政权机构，密切了政府与农民群众的联系。江西省九江、南昌等五个专区统计，共培养了区、乡干部一万多人。取得斗争胜利的农民群众，阶级觉悟迅速提高，认识到只有跟着共产党和人民政府走，才能获得解放，同时也更增加了向地主阶级进行斗争的信心。农民自动起来保护公家仓库、协助人民政府调运公粮。农民因为获得了粮食，解决了吃粮和种籽困难，打破坐待救济的观点，度过了春荒，并纷纷组织起来生产。
    部分工作干部经验主义的思想方法，曾阻碍了运动的开展。许多地区的干部在减租运动中，不是相信群众、依靠群众大胆放手开展运动，而是习惯于访穷访苦的旧经验，束手束脚，死守孤点，零零碎碎地去工作；不善于运用农民代表会议新的工作方法，致使运动发展受到限制。如湖北省蒲圻县把三分之一的干部集中在少数重点村里，经过一个多月的时间才突开一个保。沔阳县重点村南州村准备用三个月到五个月的时间来完成减租。这种工作方法，不能适合工作要求与群众要求，引起农民群众的普遍不满和焦急。
    针对以上情况，中南军政委员会与中共中央中南局及所属各级党政领导机关，除教育干部认识地主的狡猾面目、明确减租的目的以外，在政策上与工作方法上，着重地解决以下几个问题：
    第一，认真地召开各界人民代表会议与普遍地运用农民代表会议。在运动开始时，各县人民政府召开了各界人民代表会议，由参加会议的工人、农民、开明士绅、部队、机关、及各群众团体的代表，共同讨论减租工作，组成农村统一战线，动员各界人民赞助农民运动，拥护人民政府减租法令。这样，各民主阶层人民迅速接受了人民政府的各项政策，减少了阻力，使运动迅速开展起来。各地并普遍运用了农民代表会议。经验证明：凡是运用了农民代表会议的地区，减租运动便立即出现了新面貌。如湖南省长沙、邵阳等六个专署，在三月中旬前减租运动还是点点滴滴地进行，自运用农民代表会议以后，很快便有三分之一到二分之一的地区卷入了热烈的减租运动。迄今为止，河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省参加乡、区、县各级农民代表会议的代表约有二百万人，有的乡已召开过十多次会议。农民代表的产生，是根据各地不同情况选举或聘请的，经过反复审查，逐渐清洗不良分子，达到代表成份的纯洁。农民代表会议的内容，首先是提高代表的阶级觉悟，采取算剥削账、诉苦等方式，使代表们认识“谁养活谁”的道理。其次讨论减租政策与工作方法，订出计划，做成决议。会后即组织农民代表普遍与深入地传达决议，领导农民群众进行减租。在运用农民代表会议当中，有些地区也曾经犯了一些形式主义的毛病。如以少数干部与代表代替了广大群众的活动，使农民代表会议联系与组织农民群众的主要作用流于形式。或单纯地为完成上级所交待的任务而召开会议，不能认真地与代表们共同商量，研究，结果仍然是包办代替。同时有些地区在运用农民代表会议时，忽视了掌握重点、创造典型经验。这些偏差，都经过中南军政委员会与中共中央中南局及时的纠正。
    第二，运用了合法说理的斗争方法。在纠正了减租以前所发生的农村工作中的乱打乱杀现象以后，各地在减租中即采取了合法说理的斗争方法，向顽抗减租的地主、恶霸进行斗争。斗争开始以前，农民们都经过充分的酝酿，充分准备人证物证，斗争时即和顽抗的地主当面讲理。在农民们有证有据的揭发之下，违法地主瞠目结舌，只好低头认罪。采取这个办法后，农民阶级觉悟更加提高，顺利进行减租。同时也杜绝了乱扣乱打乱杀等违犯政策的现象。
    第三，反恶霸与减租结合进行。开始有的地区机械地把反恶霸与减租分开，停留在单纯的反恶霸斗争上，忽视了农民群众的减租要求。如湖北省浠水县关口区在说理斗争斗倒了恶霸郭维周后，农民要求减租，但是领导干部认为减租工作还没有准备好，依然停止在领导农民诉苦和组织工作的阶段，使减租运动拖延了一个半月。后来，干部认识了机械划分阶段的坏处，即逐渐使反恶霸与减租结合起来，在减租中遇到恶霸时，即发动农民群众首先向恶霸进行斗争，先减这些恶霸的租，在政治上打击其反动气焰，从而影响其他地主也顺从地进行了减租。
    个别地区与某些工作干部，在领导减租中，也发生了一些偏向。有的单纯追求减租数字，不注意从思想上发动农民群众，因此，表面上减租的粮食数字很大，实际上农民没有发动起来，不少地主拖延抵抗，明减暗不减，甚至被地主夺回减租粮食。如湖北省宜都江北区乌龟厂村得到减租粮的二十七户农民，其中有二十五户被非法地主张荣林把租粮夺回去。河南省商城县余集乡全乡二百七十四家佃户，起初以为都减了租，检查结果，只有十五户积极分子减了租。陕县温塘村农民代表，白天黑夜为佃户算账，形成干部包办，农民思想有顾虑，黑夜又把减出的租粮送还给地主。此外，有的农民协会对中农采取关门主义。甚至还有一些乱抓人乱押人的违犯政策的现象。以上的偏向，都及时在运动中得到纠正。
