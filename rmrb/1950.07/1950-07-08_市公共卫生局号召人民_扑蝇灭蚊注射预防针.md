Municipal Public Health Bureau Calls on People to
Eliminate Flies and Mosquitoes, Get Vaccinations

[This newspaper reported] In order to prevent infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, malaria, and encephalitis, the Municipal Public Health Bureau calls on all citizens to launch a campaign to eliminate flies and mosquitoes and to get vaccinated.

According to statistics from the Municipal Public Health Bureau: From January to the end of June this year, 310 dysentery patients were found in the city, with 104 deaths; 40 typhoid fever patients, with 36 deaths; and 4 encephalitis patients, with 3 deaths. Although these figures are more than two-thirds lower than the average for the same period last year, we cannot relax or become complacent because of this. These diseases occur every year in Beijing, and they can easily spread widely through mosquitoes and flies in the summer. Therefore, we must follow the general policy of "prevention first" and mobilize all the people of the city to work together to eliminate flies and mosquitoes. At the same time, all municipal hospitals, health clinics, entrusted hospitals and clinics, dispensaries, epidemic prevention stations, workers' clinics, and medical cooperatives in the city are providing free typhoid fever vaccinations.

　　市公共卫生局号召人民
    扑蝇灭蚊注射预防针
    【本报讯】市公共卫生局为预防伤寒、痢疾、疟疾、大脑炎等传染病，特号召全市人民展开灭蝇灭蚊工作，并进行预防注射。
    据市公共卫生局统计：本年一月到六月底全市发现痢疾患者三百一十人，死亡一百零四人；伤寒患者四十人，死亡三十六人；大脑炎患者四人，死亡三人。虽然比去年同时期平均减少了三分之二以上，但不能因此就松懈麻痹，因为这些病在北京年年都有发生，在夏季容易借蚊蝇的传播而广泛流行，所以必须遵照以预防为主的总方针，动员全市人民大家起来做灭蝇灭蚊工作。同时，本市各市立医院、卫生所、嘱托医院及诊疗所、防疫站、工人诊疗所及医药合作社都在进行伤寒预防免费注射。
