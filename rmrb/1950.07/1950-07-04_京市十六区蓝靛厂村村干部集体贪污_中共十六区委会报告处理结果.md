　　Collective Embezzlement by Village Cadres in Landianchang Village, Sixteenth District of Beijing
　　Report on Handling Results from the CCP Sixteenth District Committee

　　To the Editor:
　　The village government of Landianchang Administrative Village in the Sixteenth District of Beijing has over 3,600 catties of millet in storage for disaster relief. The village head, Wang Chunsheng, the director of the farmers' association, Mr. Wang, and 12 others privately divided this stored grain amongst themselves. How can a new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao tolerate the existence of such corrupt elements? We request that the editor forward this to the relevant departments for investigation and reply.
　　Zhao Jianwen

　　Reply from the CCP Sixteenth District Committee of Beijing Suburbs

　　To the Editor:
　　The embezzlement by cadres in Landianchang is indeed a fact, and the amount mentioned in Zhao Jianwen's letter is generally accurate. However, this portion of grain was not for disaster relief for the poor. Among it, 321 catties were used for public welfare by Comrade Yu Zhongku, a district cadre (formerly the head of the Landianchang work group) (such as expenses for repairing toilets and the village government's storm doors). Another 240 catties were lent to village cadres with financial difficulties. There are still 36 catties remaining, with a shortage of 123 catties due to weighing inaccuracies. The remaining 2,880 catties, including 1,880 catties, were collectively embezzled by 14 village cadres (including village head Zhang Qichang, farmers' association director Wang Jiheng, and village clerk Zhan Daijun).

　　Regarding this matter, we heard reports from the masses after the start of spring plowing and production work this year. In May, the facts were clarified by the work group. At that time, the comrades of the original work group working in the village were busy with the spring plowing inspection work arranged by the Suburban Committee, which prevented a timely resolution of this issue. The handling results are now reported as follows:

　　Village head Zhang Qichang has been removed from his position. Grain and finance committee member Cheng Yinting and communication officer Lei Yucheng have also been removed from their positions. Deputy village head Wang Chunsheng has admitted his mistakes and apologized to the masses and has been given a major demerit and placed on probation while retaining his position. Clerk Zhan Daijun and public security officer Wang Zhenlin have been given criticism and education. Farmers' association committee members An Yude and Dou Songlin have been removed from their positions. Other committee members and the director of the farmers' association have been given criticism and education.

　　Regarding the handling of the grain in question: with the exception of the 321 catties of grain that Comrade Yu Zhongku of the work group agreed to use for public welfare, the grain lent with the village head's approval and embezzled by the cadres must be fully returned after the autumn harvest when they have the ability to do so.

　　The CCP Sixteenth District Committee of Beijing

　　京市十六区蓝靛厂村村干部集体贪污
    中共十六区委会报告处理结果编辑同志：
    我京市十六区蓝靛厂行政村村政府，存有赈济小米三千六百余斤。该村长王春生、农会主任王某等十四人，竟将该项存粮私自均分。在毛主席领导下的新中国岂能容许此类腐败分子存在？请编者同志转有关部门调查答复。

    中共京郊第十六区委会的答复编者同志：
    蓝靛厂干部贪污确是事实，赵建文的信中所说的数目亦大体不差。但这部分粮食，并非赈济贫民的。其中有三百二十一斤，经区干部（原蓝靛厂工作组长）于仲库同志作了公益之用（如修理了厕所、村政府风门等费用）。另外二百四十斤借给了生活困难的村干部。现在尚存三十六斤，亏秤一百二十三斤。余数二千八百八十斤，其中一千八百八十斤被村干部（包括村长张其昌、农会主任王纪恒及村文书展代君等）十四人集体贪污。
    关于这个问题，我们在今年春耕生产工作开始后，即曾听到群众反映。在五月中，经工作组将事实查明。那时因在该村工作之原工作组同志忙于郊委所布置的春耕检查工作，使这一问题未能及时解决。现将处理结果奉告如下：
    村长张其昌已予撤职处分。财粮委员程荫庭、通讯员雷玉成亦予撤职处分。副村长王春生，向群众承认错误及道歉，并记大过一次，留职察看。文书展代君、公安员王振林则予以批评教育处分。农会委员安玉德、窦松林撤职。其他委员及农会主任予以批评教育处分。
    关于该项粮食的处理办法是：除经工作组于仲库同志同意动用作公益用的三百二十一斤粮食外，其他经村长同意借出，及各干部所贪污之粮食等，要他们在秋收后有能力归还时完全退回。
