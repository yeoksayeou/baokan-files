Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 12th. This spring, the Kangzhuang Township People's Government of Wuyang County, Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, accurately implemented the policies and guidelines of the People's Government and the mass line working method in leading the township's farmers in land reform. Consequently, they brought into play the wisdom and enthusiasm of the peasant masses and orderly completed the task of land allocation.

First, the township cadres broke with the old formalistic format of mobilizing the masses. Instead of the cadres subjectively handling matters according to their own pre-determined formats, they consulted with the masses on everything, starting from solving the immediate urgent demands of the masses. For example, when starting to rectify the peasant ranks, the common urgent demands of the township's farmers were threefold: First, the spring famine was serious, and many farmers demanded food to eat. Many farmers said, "People are about to starve to death, what's the point of distributing land?" Second, illegal landlords continued to sabotage or steal means of production, and some landlords even openly ridiculed farmers who demanded land reform, causing great indignation among the masses. Everyone demanded resolute prevention of these illegal acts by landlords. Third, the work style of individual township and village cadres was impure, and they did not handle affairs democratically. The peasant masses demanded their replacement. Based on these demands of the peasant masses, the township people's government first tried to solve the problem of food for disaster victims, converting the remaining three hundred catties of sesame cakes and one stone of sesame oil from the fruits of struggle against the local bullies into two stones and two dou of black beans, plus a portion of grain from the village's public granary, and distributed it to thirty poor peasants and farm laborers who were out of food. Then, the township peasant association convened a mass meeting to pour out grievances and reason things out, launching a struggle against the sabotage of illegal landlords. Township and village cadres also openly reviewed their work shortcomings and incorrect work style to the peasant masses, humbly solicited opinions from the masses at the peasant representative conference, and, with the approval of the district government, re-elected individual leading cadres. As a result, the class consciousness of the masses rapidly improved, the peasant ranks rapidly expanded, and morale was high, successfully achieving the purpose of rectifying the ranks.

Second, discussing policies from top to bottom, brewing them to maturity, so that the policies are truly mastered by the peasant masses. For example, after repeated explanations of the methods of class division, the peasant masses grasped the spirit of the policies and could correctly divide classes. Even landlords and rich peasants could mostly pre-determine their own class status in accordance with the standards of class division. Individual landlords who attempted to quibble could only lower their heads and admit it after the peasants presented concrete witness testimony. Therefore, the work of class division throughout the township proceeded smoothly, without misclassifying a single household. The policies of confiscation and requisition were also correctly implemented because of in-depth discussions in advance. The peasants launched a struggle to reason with individual landlords who concealed or under-reported their property. For property not within the scope of the regulations to be confiscated, even if the landlords reported it themselves, the peasants resolutely refused to take it. In the distribution of fruits, the peasants in the township implemented the principle of "mutual respect and concession" and "rich villages helping poor villages," so that the land between villages was rationally adjusted. The policy of giving landlords the same share of land and property as peasants was implemented. Therefore, the result of the distribution was not only satisfactory to the peasants, but also satisfactory to the landlords.

Third, a broad rural anti-feudal united front was formed in the land reform, fully uniting all anti-feudal forces. Throughout the entire movement, in addition to grasping and relying on the poor peasants and farm laborers, and uniting with the middle peasants, the township people's government also paid attention to uniting the township's intellectuals and striving for their participation in the land reform movement. Male and female young peasants were more systematically organized to bring into play their active leading role.

　　河南省舞阳县康庄乡政府
    贯彻群众路线工作方法  分配土地任务顺利完成
    【新华社开封十二日电】河南省许昌专区舞阳县康庄乡人民政府今春在领导该乡农民进行土地改革的工作中，确切地贯彻了人民政府当时的政策方针，和贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，因而发挥了农民群众的智慧和积极性，有秩序地完成了分配土地的任务。
    首先，该乡干部打破了形式主义的发动群众的旧格式。不是干部主观地按自己拟定的格式办事，而是凡事和群众商量，从解决群众当前迫切要求作起。譬如：在开始整顿农民队伍的时候，该乡农民共同的迫切要求有三点：一、春荒严重，不少农民要求有粮食吃。许多农民都说：“人都快饿死了，还分地干啥？”二、不法地主继续破坏或盗卖生产资料，有的地主还公开讥笑要求实行土地改革的农民，引起群众极大愤慨。大家要求坚决制止地主的这些不法行为。三、个别乡、村干部作风不纯，办事不民主，农民群众纷纷要求掉换他。根据农民群众的这些要求，该乡人民政府首先设法解决灾民吃粮问题，把反对恶霸时斗争果实中余下来的三百斤芝麻饼和一石芝麻的香油，变换成二石二斗黑豆，加上一部分村上义仓粮食，分给了三十户断炊贫农和雇农。接着，乡农民协会召开了群众诉苦讲理大会，向不法地主进行反破坏的斗争。乡、村干部也公开向农民群众检讨工作缺点和不正确的作风，在农民代表会议上虚心征求群众意见，并经区政府批准，改选了个别领导干部。结果，群众阶级觉悟迅速提高，农民队伍迅速扩大，情绪也很饱满，顺利地达到了整顿队伍的目的。
    第二，从上到下，讨论政策，酝酿成熟，使政策真正为农民群众所掌握。如经反复讲解划分阶级的方法以后，农民群众掌握了政策精神，都能正确划分阶级。就是地主、富农也多能事先按照划分阶级的标准自己划好成份。个别企图狡赖的地主，经过农民举出具体的人证物证，只有低头承认。因此全乡划分阶级的工作进行很顺利，没有错定一户。没收征收的政策，也因事先深入讨论而被正确执行。农民对个别隐瞒或少报财产的地主，开展了反隐瞒的说理斗争。凡不在规定要没收的范围内的财产，即使地主自己报告出来，农民们也坚决不要。分配果实当中，该乡农民执行了“互尊互让”、“富村帮助穷村”的分配原则，使村与村之间的土地获得合理的调剂。对地主则贯彻了分予和农民同样一份土地财产的政策。因而，分配的结果，不仅农民满意，地主也表示满意。
    第三，在土地改革中组成了广大的农村反封建统一战线，充分团结了各种反封建的力量。该乡人民政府在整个运动中，除掌握依靠贫农、雇农，团结中农的方针以外，还注意团结该乡的知识分子，争取他们参加土地改革运动。对男女青年农民，更有计划地加以组织，使他们发挥了积极带头的作用。
