　　Shanghai State-Owned and Public Enterprises
    Implement Democratic Management to Improve Production
    Leading Cadres Conduct Self-Criticism and Examine Bureaucratic Work Styles, Which is Key to Mobilizing the Masses to Transform Old Enterprises.
    [Our Newspaper] In order to realize the principle of democratization of factory management, state-owned and public enterprises in Shanghai first studied this newspaper's editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises." After full discussion and deliberation, by the end of June, units such as Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Plant No. 1, some units of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, the Public Transportation Company, the Postal Administration, and the factories under the China Textile Company had established democratic management committees or convened employee representative conferences.
    The experience of the Shanghai Postal Administration in establishing a democratic management committee proves that the key to the long-term inability to realize democratic management lies in the serious existence of bureaucratic work styles among leading cadres. The bureau began planning to establish a management committee at the end of last year, and promoted this work in a planned and step-by-step manner in March of this year, but the majority of employees still lacked confidence in democratic management. This was because the bureaucratic work style of the bureau's leading cadres and the old management system of "absolute centralization and mutual restraint" had not been changed. Administrative leaders were aloof, and reasonable suggestions made by employees sometimes took one or two months to resolve, or were neither adopted nor answered, thus weakening employees' confidence in making suggestions. After the bureau's leaders discovered and recognized this problem, they conducted a two-week leadership review starting on April 24th of this year. The heads of each unit made self-criticisms to the employees of their respective units. On May 11th and 12th, a mass meeting of more than 2,000 postal workers was convened under the personal supervision of the directors of the East China Postal General and Branch Bureaus. Wang Yuguang, deputy director of the Shanghai Administration Bureau, made a self-criticism to all employees on behalf of the administration, deeply analyzing past shortcomings in work, and resolving to eliminate bureaucratic work styles. After the meeting, all accumulated cases of improvement in business proposed by the masses over the past four months were handled cautiously and responsibly, and replies were given to each proposer. At the same time, according to the opinions of the workers, public document procedures were simplified, report forms were streamlined, a system of layered responsibility was established, and the old unreasonable system began to be reformed. The emotions of the employees were stirred up by these concrete facts. Employees also launched a struggle against corruption and smuggling, automatically formulated labor conventions, and some units also launched red flag competitions. By mid-June, all employees of the bureau had launched a heatwave of elections for members of the factory management committee, and the factory democratic management committee was officially established on June 25th.
    In various enterprise units that have established democratic management committees or convened employee representative meetings, the consciousness of employees has gradually increased, and production efficiency has begun to increase. Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Plant No. 1 completed its production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded its quota in the Red May competition. Various units of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have implemented a responsibility system, eliminating the black, crowded, and dirty phenomena of passenger trains. Various routes of the Public Transportation Company have launched red flag competitions, generally achieving twelve kilometers per gallon of oil, an increase of onefold compared to before liberation. The sub-fabric rate of various China Textile factories has decreased month by month. These facts powerfully prove the correctness of the point made in the "Learn to Manage Enterprises" editorial that "to increase industrial production, we must first manage enterprises well."

　　上海国营及公营企业
    实行民主管理提高生产
    领导干部开展自我批评，检查官僚主义作风，是发动群众改造旧企业的关键。
    【本报讯】上海各国营、公营企业为实现工厂管理民主化的方针，首先学习了本报“学会管理企业”的社论，经过充分的讨论、酝酿，至六月底已有上海钢铁公司一厂、上海铁路局若干单位、公共交通公司、邮政管理局及中纺公司所属各厂等单位已建立了民主管理委员会或召开了职工代表会议。
    上海邮政管理局建立民主管理委员会的经验证明：长期不能实现民主管理的关键就在于领导干部的官僚主义作风严重存在。该局从去年年底即酝酿成立管委会，今年三月又有计划有步骤地推动这一工作，但广大职工对民主管理仍然信心不高。这是因为该局领导干部的官僚主义作风，以及“绝对集中、互相牵制”等旧管理制度并未改变所致。行政领导干部高高在上，职工提出的合理的建议，有的是一两个月才能解决，有的是既不采纳也不答复，因而使职工提意见的信心减弱了。当该局领导发现并认识这一问题后，从今年四月二十四日开始，一连进行了两个星期的领导检查。各单位负责人向本单位职工作自我批评。五月十一、十二两天，在华东邮政总、分局局长亲自主持下，召集了两千多邮工的群众大会。由上海管理局副局长王裕光代表行政向全体职工进行自我批评，深刻分析过去工作缺点，决心消灭官僚主义作风。会后，即将四个月来群众所提出的改进业务的各项积案慎重负责地进行处理，并向提案人逐一答复。同时又根据工人意见，简化公文手续、精简表报、建立分层负责制，开始改革了旧的不合理制度。职工情绪被这些具体事实激动起来。职工们也展开了反贪污走私斗争，自动订立劳动公约，部分单位并掀起红旗竞赛。到六月中旬，该局全体职工就展开了工厂管委会委员的竞选热潮，于六月二十五日正式成立了工厂民主管委会。
    建立了民主管委会或召开了职工代表会的各企业单位，职工觉悟逐渐提高，生产效率开始增加。上海钢铁公司一厂在红五月竞赛中提前超额完成生产任务。上海铁路局各单位实行了负责制，消灭了旅客列车的黑、挤、脏的现象。公共交通公司各线路展开红旗竞赛，普遍达到每加仑油可行走十二公里，较解放前增加一倍。中纺各厂次布率逐月降低。这些事实有力地证明了“学会管理企业”社论中所指出的“增加工业生产，首先要管好企业”的正确性。
