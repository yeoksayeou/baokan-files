Commanders and fighters of all units expressed at the discussion meetings that they would not be intimidated by any warmongers.

The Political Department of the Fourth Field Army Headquarters also sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Foreign Minister Zhou on behalf of the entire army, stating: From the four years of the Liberation War, we have discerned the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialists, and Truman's statement only exposed their predetermined aggressive plan.
