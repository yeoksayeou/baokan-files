Fighting on the Banks of the Yongding River
    ——A Record of Road Construction by a Unit of the People's Liberation Army in North China
    (I)
    The muddy torrent of the Yongding River enters a steep and narrow gorge at Guantinger Village in Huailai County. After flowing over 120 kilometers to the vicinity of Sanjiadian in western Beijing, it rushes towards the vast North China Plain north of the Daqing River like a wild horse freed from its reins. The large amount of silt accumulates at the bottom of the river, and in the Gu'an and Anci areas, the water surface often rises above the roofs of villages on both banks. Whenever mountain floods erupt in the summer, and the dikes are in danger, the lives and property of millions of people in Gu'an, Yongqing, Anci, Xiongxian, Baxian, and even the Tianjin urban area are seriously threatened.
    As early as last year, the People's Government sent people to conduct surveying work to rectify the Yongding River, planning to build a reservoir in Guanting. One of this year's important projects is to build a highway directly to the Ping-Sui Railway to facilitate the smooth transportation of necessary materials.
    After reclaiming 2,000 mu of wasteland in April, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army took on the most arduous section of the project: building a highway for the construction of the Guanting Reservoir.
    On April 30th, representatives elected by each squad of the regiment visited the Guanting Reservoir project. At the same time, Chief Chen of the Water Conservancy Bureau introduced that the Yongding River was formerly called the "Wuding River" (Unstable River), and it was only renamed the Yongding River (Perpetually Stable River) during the Qing Dynasty, but it remained the "Wuding River" afterwards. The Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries also attempted to rectify it, but they either stopped at written plans or wasted manpower and resources in vain without accomplishing anything. Commanders and fighters expressed great resentment towards the harm caused by the Yongding River, treating it like a hateful enemy. Wang Zhiqin, a soldier in the machine gun company of the Second Battalion, wrote in his diary: "We must work harder and study technology more in road construction, and we must complete the task ahead of schedule to eliminate this great harm for the people!" This is precisely the unanimous and solemn oath of the entire regiment.
    (II)
    Several earth mountains formed by years of flooding stand on the left bank of the Yongding River. Under the cliffs sixty to seventy meters high, the surging torrents are rolling. On the mountain, there is only a narrow and rugged path barely passable by donkeys leading to Guanting, making transportation very difficult. The commanders and fighters had to cut off the mountains at the waist, and pave a wide highway. They had to stand on the cliffs and precipices, use shovels and spades to excavate more than 100,000 cubic meters of earth, and dig down more than 30 meters directly from the top of the mountain, and also fill up the mountain gullies. This was indeed an arduous task.
    The artillery company and the machine gun company of the Second Battalion arrived at the mountain top on April 24th to prepare for excavation, but they encountered serious difficulties on the first day.
    Lined up along the mountain top for more than half a li, the commanders and fighters wielded their shovels and dug into the mountain. At noon, a northwest wind picked up, and the mountain top was filled with dust and sand. A shovel of earth thrown down the mountain immediately rolled back and hit the mountain top, striking faces, and getting into ears, noses, and eyes. The soldiers spat out the sand in their mouths, rubbed their eyes, and continued to swing their shovels. However, the wind and sand grew stronger and stronger, and even clumps of earth the size of chestnuts were rolled up. The commander told everyone to rest, leaving two platoons in the wind and sand to study solutions. The soldiers suggested one after another: "The wind is strong on the mountain top, let's dig on the mountainside!" Feng Zhi, a soldier from the machine gun company of the Second Battalion, was surveying the terrain on the hillside when the ground under his feet suddenly collapsed, and he rolled down the mountain, suffering serious injuries.
    On this day, each person excavated less than one cubic meter of earth on average. However, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, who had experienced hundreds of battles, could not have their firm will shaken by any difficulties. After returning to the village, "Zhuge Liang Meetings" were held everywhere. They said: "Everyone uses their brains, everyone thinks of solutions, and we are not afraid of any difficulties!"
    (III)
    Wind and sand are the biggest obstacles to opening mountains and building roads, but how can we stop the wind from blowing? Lu Qing, the organization section chief of the regiment responsible for leading the two companies in road construction, thought repeatedly. Finally, he thought: This may just be a temporary phenomenon of bad weather. Sure enough, the next morning, the sky cleared and the wind stopped. But after noon, the northwest wind picked up again, and dense dust and sand filled the entire mountain top again. After work, he painstakingly studied and investigated the local climate patterns from the masses, and finally grasped them. On the third day, the start time was moved up two hours, and by the time the wind started at noon, the troops had already returned to the village to study culture.
    At this time, there was also great progress in excavation. The soldiers tied ropes around their waists, and the other end of the rope was tied to large wooden stakes that were firmly nailed in place. Facing the rushing torrent, standing on the earth slope as straight as a wall, the soldiers shouted: "Cast a big net to catch big fish!" They raised their shovels and divided the mountain top into large chunks, and then inserted large wooden levers. A dozen people shouted "One—Two" and exerted force downward together. With a shout of "Charge!", large chunks of earth of seven, eight, or even ten cubic meters rolled straight down from the cliff. Then, a burst of loud "rumbling" sound was heard from below the mountain; a cheer rang out on the mountain top: "Listen! Artillery fire!"
    On the third and fourth days, the efficiency of excavation had already increased to an average of about six cubic meters per person.
    (IV)
    "Diligence plus technology," "Think of better ways to dig faster and save more effort"—these are the questions that the commanders and fighters were constantly studying carefully. Just like fighting battles in the past, they strove to complete the task quickly and decisively with as little cost as possible.
    After putting down their shovels, the soldiers gathered behind the mountain to hold "Zhuge Liang Meetings." The commander patrolled the mountain top and found that one squad was digging a large chunk, and the people were crowded and inconvenient to work, which not only wasted labor but was also prone to accidents. So, he convened all the squad leaders to specifically study the squad's working methods. After continuous research, on the fifth day, a new record of more than twelve cubic meters of earth excavated per person by the fifth squad of the Second Battalion's machine gun company emerged.
    All seven members of the fifth squad participating in road construction formed two groups, each digging a long vertical ditch from the top of the mountain to the middle of the mountainside, dividing the area assigned to the entire squad into several large rectangular blocks. Then, from top to bottom, they horizontally cut it open piece by piece and pushed it down the mountain. After digging one layer, they "divided" it again and pushed it down. The whole squad excavated a total of eighty-eight cubic meters of earth in one day. This method was proposed by the soldier Ding Jixiu and implemented after discussion and revision by the entire squad. They themselves called it the "tactics" of "group segmentation and full-squad assault."
    The fifth squad's method quickly spread. The towering mountain top was quickly segmented, and large chunks rolled down the mountain.
    (V)
    Unexpected situations were encountered at the work site of the artillery company, where they found hard clay slabs and gravel. The commanders and fighters carefully studied the soil quality on the mountainside and found a layer of loose sandy soil beneath the clay and gravel. Several people went down to dig out the sandy soil, nailed wooden wedges above, and swung hammers to smash them. More than ten cubic meters of gravel and hard soil chunks cracked and rolled down the mountain.
    Now, the entire regiment has reached the mountain top and is working hard. The large mountain top has been cut down by more than ten meters, and is gradually approaching the highway built by the civilian workers on both sides. A wide and flat highway points directly to Guanting. The soldiers talked about how "the endless sandy beaches on both sides of the Yongding River will turn into green rice paddies after the reservoir is built." The bright and happy prospects of the future of the new China encouraged the enthusiasm of every soldier. The cheerful labor songs of the people's soldiers are floating everywhere on the mountain top.

　　战斗在永定河岸
    ——记人民解放军华北某部开山修路
    （一）
    永定河浑浊的激流，在怀来县官厅村进入陡峭狭窄的山峡，经一百二十多公里到京西三家店附近，象一匹脱缰的野马，直向大清河北平原奔泻。大量的泥沙淤积在河底，在固安、安次地带，水面常常高出于两岸村庄的屋顶。每当夏季山洪暴发，堤防出险，固安、永清、安次、雄县、霸县甚至天津市区，千百万人民的生命财产，便受到严重的威胁。
    早在去年，人民政府就派人进行了整顿永定河的测量工程，计划在官厅修筑水库。今年的重要工程之一，是修筑直达平绥线的公路，以便顺畅地运输必需的器材。
    人民解放军某团在四月间垦荒两千亩以后，接着就担负起了为修建官厅水库而修筑公路的最艰巨的一段工程。
    四月三十日，该团各班推选代表，去官厅参观水库工程；同时听水利局陈科长介绍了：永定河过去叫“无定河”，满清时才改名叫永定河，但以后仍然是“无定河”。日寇和国民党反动派也曾企图整修，但不是停止于书面计划，就是白白浪费了人力、财力而一事无成。指战员们对于永定河的为害，象对待可恶的敌人一样，表示了极大的愤恨。二营机枪连战士王志岐在日记上写道：“在修路当中一定要多卖力气，多研究技术，一定提前完成任务，为人民除此大害！”这正是全团一致的庄严誓言。
    （二）
    几座多年来被洪水冲积而成的土山，耸立在永定河的左岸，六七十米高的悬崖下，翻滚着汹涌的激流。山上，只有一条驴驮勉强通行的羊肠小道通向官厅，运输非常困难。指战员们要把山头拦腰斩断，铺平一道宽阔的公路，要站在悬崖峭壁之上，用铁锨铁锹掘土十万余方，从山顶直凿下三十余米，并且要填平山沟。这确是一个艰巨的任务。
    炮兵连和二营机枪连，在四月二十四日到达山头准备掘土，但第一天就遭遇到了严重的困难。
    顺着山头排成半里多长的行列，指战员们挥起铁锨向山下掘土。过午，西北风刮起来了，山头上一片尘沙，一锨土抛向山下，立刻卷回来扑上山头，打在脸上，钻进耳杂里、鼻孔里、眼睛里。战士们吐出嘴里的沙子，揉揉眼睛，仍然不停地挥动铁锨。但是风沙越来越大，象栗子一样大小的土块都卷起来了。指挥员让大家休息，留两个排在风沙中研究办法。战士们纷纷提出：“山头风大，山腰去挖！”二营机枪连战士冯志到山坡上探测地形，脚下的土忽然塌了，他翻身滚下山去，受了重伤。
    这一天，每人平均挖土不到一方。但是，身经百战的人民解放军指战员，任何困难也动摇不了他们坚强的意志。返回驻村后，到处开起了“诸葛亮会”。他们说：“人人用脑子，大家想办法，天大的困难也不怕！”
    （三）
    风沙是开山修路的最大障碍，但又怎能制止风不刮呢？负责领导两个连修路的团组织股长卢青反复地思考着。最后他想：这也许只是一时天气不好的现象。果然，第二天早晨，天晴风静。但过了中午，西北风又刮了起来，浓密的尘沙，又弥漫了整个山头。收工以后，他苦心钻研，又向群众调查了解，终于掌握了当地气候的规律。第三天，开工的时间提早了两个钟头，等到过午风起时，部队早已返回驻村学习文化了。
    这时，在挖土方面也有了很大的进步。战士们腰里系着绳子，绳的另一端，捆在钉得结结实实的大木桩上。面对着奔腾的激流，站在象墙壁一样直陡的土坡上，战士们喊着：“撒大网，捉大鱼！”举起铁锹，把山头分割成一大块一大块的，然后插进大木杠，十几个人喊着“一——二”，一齐用力向山下推。一声“冲啊！”七、八方、十几方的大土块，从悬崖上直滚下去。接着，山下发出一阵“轰隆隆隆”的巨响；山头上扬起一片欢呼：“听！榴弹炮！”
    第三、四天，挖土的效率已经提高到每人平均六方左右了。
    （四）
    “肯干加技术”，“想更好的办法，争取挖的更快，更省劲”，这是指战员们时刻都在细心钻研的问题。象过去打仗一样，他们竭力争取以更小的代价，迅速、干脆地完成任务。
    放下铁锨，战士们就凑在山后开“诸葛亮会”指挥员在山头上巡视着，发现一个班挖一大块，人拥挤着不便干活，不但浪费劳力，并且还容易出危险。于是就召集各个班长专门研究了班的工作方法问题。经过不断的研究，第五天，就出现了二营机枪连五班每人挖土十二方多的新纪录。
    五班全班参加修路的七个人，两个人一组挖一道长长的纵沟，从山头直到半山腰，把全班分担的地段，分割成长方形的几大块。然后再从上而下，一小块一小块的把它横断切开，推下山去。挖了一层，再“分割”，又推下去。一天内全班共挖了八十八方土。这个办法是战士丁继修提出，经过全班讨论修正后实行的。他们自己称为“小组分割、全班突击”的“战术”。
    五班的办法迅速推广开来。耸立的山头迅速地被分割开来，一大块一大块的滚下山去。
    （五）
    在炮兵连的工作地点遇到了意外的情况，他们那里发现了坚硬的胶泥板和碎石块。指战员们到山腰详细地研究了土质，发现胶泥碎石下面，有一层松软的沙土。几个人下去把沙土掏出来，上边钉上木楔子，抡起本锤猛砸，十几多方的碎石和硬土块崩裂开来，翻滚到山下去。
    现在，全团都已到达山头紧张工作。大山头已经被切下十几米，和两侧民工们修筑的公路逐渐接近。一条宽阔平坦的公路直指官厅。战士们谈论着：“永定河两岸一望无边的荒沙滩，在水库修成后，将变成一片绿油油的稻田。”新中国未来的美满与幸福的远景，鼓舞着每一个战士的热情。山头上到处飘荡着人民战士的愉快的劳动歌声。
