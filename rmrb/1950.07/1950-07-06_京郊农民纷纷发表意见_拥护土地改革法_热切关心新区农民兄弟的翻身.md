　　Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Association Preparatory Committee, said: After the completion of land reform, the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are very concerned about the emancipation of their farmer brothers in the vast new liberated areas of the South. After the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, they immediately responded enthusiastically to the government's call for a 10% increase in agricultural production. This powerfully illustrates that without land reform, the vast number of farmers oppressed by the feudal land system for thousands of years could not have been liberated. Their enthusiasm for production would not have been able to be brought into play. Chai Zemin said: Based on the experience of land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, preserving the rich peasant economy is necessary today. During the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, the self-cultivated and hired-labor-operated land and other properties of rich peasants were not touched, which has proven extremely beneficial to the recovery and development of agricultural production in the suburbs. Chai Zemin emphasized that the Land Reform Law stipulates that "the farmers' congress, the farmers' representative congress, and the farmers' association committee elected by them are the legal executive organs for reforming the land system," which is extremely important. This time, in the implementation of land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, the more than 200 village farmers' associations and more than 110,000 members in the suburbs were the core force of the land reform movement; in the form of a farmers' representative meeting, more than 300,000 farmers in the entire suburbs were united around it, and only then was the landlord class defeated and the land system reformed in the five months from last winter to this spring. Land reform is a fierce class struggle. Without the awakening of the peasant masses and the power united on the basis of this awakening, it is impossible to completely eliminate feudalism.
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th: After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing were very excited. They were excited that the feudal land system would be eliminated nationwide within two or three years, and that farmers across the country would get land like them. They all supported the provisions of the Land Reform Law. For example, regarding the preservation of the rich peasant economy, Zhu Wenkui, a poor peasant in Huangcun, West Suburb, said: "Now that the land property of the rich peasants is preserved, everyone is even less worried and will work harder to produce and get rich." Huang Baogui, a poor peasant in Xiaohongmen Village, also said: "Moving the land property of the rich peasants is like drawing a line in front of the peasants, and no one dares to cross it. Now no one has any worries about production." Wang Wanchun, a middle peasant in Huangcun, recently bought a mule and said: "Now everyone dares to embark on the road of developing production." Li Yongjiang, the village chief of Huangcun, said: "A single tree cannot make a forest, and the landlords are even more isolated." Regarding the point that those who rent out a small amount of land are not treated as landlords, they believe that this will better take care of working people in other occupations and the orphaned, widowed, or families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres who lack labor.

### 京郊农民纷纷发表意见  拥护土地改革法  热切关心新区农民兄弟的翻身

　　京郊农民纷纷发表意见
    拥护土地改革法
    热切关心新区农民兄弟的翻身
    【新华社五日讯】北京市农会筹备委员会主任柴泽民说：北京市郊区农民在完成土地改革以后，非常关心南方广大新解放区农民兄弟的翻身。北京郊区的农民，在土地改革以后，立即热烈响应人民政府对农业提出的增产一成的号召。这就有力地说明：如果没有土地改革，在几千年的封建土地制压榨下的广大农民就不能获得解放。他们的生产积极性也就不可能发挥出来。柴泽民说：根据北京郊区实行土地改革的经验，保存富农经济在今天是必要的。北京郊区土地改革中，没有动富农的自耕和雇工经营的土地和其他财产，这对郊区农业生产的恢复和发展，已经证明极为有利。柴泽民强调说：土地改革法规定“农民大会，农民代表大会及其选出的农民协会委员会，为改革土地制度的合法执行机关”一点，极为重要。这次北京郊区实行土地改革，郊区的二百多个乡村农会和十一万多会员，是土地改革运动的核心力量；以农民代表会的形式在它的周围团结了全郊区三十多万农民，才在去冬今春五个月中打垮了地主阶级，改革了土地制度。土地改革是一场激烈的阶级斗争，没有农民群众的觉悟和在这个觉悟基础上团结起来的力量，要彻底消灭封建主义是不可能的。
    【新华社五日讯】中华人民共和国土地改革法公布后，北京郊区农民很兴奋。他们为封建土地制度两三年内在全国范围内被消灭，全国农民都将和他们一样得到土地而感到兴奋。他们对土地改革法的规定都很拥护。比如，对保存富农经济一点，西郊黄村贫农朱文魁说：“现在保存了富农的土地财产，大家更没顾虑，更要努力生产，发家致富了。”小红门村贫农黄宝贵也说：“动富农的土地财产，就像在农民前头划了一道线，谁也不敢冒过去，现在谁在生产上都没顾虑了。”黄村中农王万春最近买了一头骡子，并说：“这一下大家都敢往发展生产的路上走。”黄村村长李永江说：“孤树不成林，地主更加孤立了。”对于出租少量土地者不以地主对待这点，他们认为这样就能更好地照顾其他职业的劳动人民和缺乏劳动力的孤寡或烈属、军属和干属。
