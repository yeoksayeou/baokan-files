Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Despite the fact that American imperialism is doing everything possible to conceal and deceive the American people, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 23rd, the rout of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, supported by the United States, and the repeated defeats of the American army on the Korean battlefield have already "confused the American people." Although these "American people," deceived by propaganda, believe that the situation in China and Korea is not a failure of the United States itself, but merely the result of the uselessness of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, they nevertheless feel that the current situation is completely different from the myths spread by American newspapers in the past. According to the Agence France-Presse reporter, "The public is beginning to ask some major questions and to ask their representatives – Republicans or Democrats (in fact, they are only representatives of big capitalists): Why are our Asian allies fighting so badly?" They also doubt whether America's "European allies will perform any better." The reporter said, "Americans are not entirely satisfied with the government's statements." They ask, "Why are Asians so willing to sacrifice themselves for Mao Zedong and Kim Il-sung, but unwilling to sacrifice themselves for Chiang Kai-shek or Syngman Rhee?" They also ask, "Why do these people fight bravely under the communist banner, but run away when fighting for a regime that an American considers similar to Western democracy?" Some Americans, who once believed in the superiority of the atomic bomb and air force under the deceitful propaganda of American imperialism, now also believe that "the atomic bomb and the strategic air force cannot reassure them."

　　蒋介石李承晚先后垮台
    美报纸的神话宣传欺骗不住美国人民
    【新华社二十六日讯】尽管美帝国主义千方百计地隐瞒和欺骗美国人民，但据法新社记者二十三日自华盛顿报道，美国支持的李承晚傀儡军的溃败以及美国军队在朝鲜战场上的连战皆北，已“使美国老百姓困惑起来”。虽然这些“美国老百姓”因受欺骗宣传而以为中国和朝鲜的局势并不是美国本身的失败，而只是蒋介石和李承晚不中用的结果，但是，他们毕竟感到目前的情势和美国报纸过去所传播的神话的完全不同。据法新社记者说：“公众正开始质问一些重大问题，并向他们的代表——共和党人或民主党人（其实他们只是大资本家的代表）提出：我们的亚洲盟国为什么打得这样坏？”他们还怀疑美国的“欧洲盟国是否会表现得好一些”，该记者说：“美国人并不是完全对政府的声明表示满意的”。他们发出疑问：“为什么亚洲人十分愿意为毛泽东与金日成牺牲，而不愿意为蒋介石或李承晚牺牲？”他们还问：“这些人民为什么在共产党的旗帜下英勇作战，而当为一个美国人认为与西方民主政体近似的政权作战时却反而逃跑呢？”有些曾经在美帝国主义欺骗宣传下相信原子弹与空军优势的美国人，现在也认为“原子弹与战略空军都不能使他们安心”了。（附图片）
