How the People of Shuyang are Overcoming the New Famine

	Severe New Famine
After the heavy rain in mid-April this year, the people of Shuyang suffered a new famine. Out of more than 1.21 million mu of wheat fields in the county, 669,000 mu were flooded, and out of more than 580,000 mu of spring fields that had been planted, 260,000 mu were also flooded. At the same time, the disaster situation developed, and the number of disaster victims relying on digging wild vegetables and government relief grain increased sharply to 210,000 (170,000 before the rain), and most of the wild vegetables were flooded. Among the 120,000 disaster victims working on the Yi River project who relied on work-for-relief to support their families, some were unable to earn wages due to continuous rain and excessive water accumulation, which prevented construction. In terms of sideline occupations, some were shut down due to a lack of raw materials because of being surrounded by flood waters. Disaster victims who had originally pinned their hopes on the wheat harvest now saw their wheat fields flooded and believed that the whole year's harvest was hopeless, and a pessimistic and disappointed mood grew.

		Go All Out to Complete Spring Planting
Faced with this serious new famine, the Shuyang Party, government, army and people immediately went all out to drain water, protect wheat, and carry out emergency relief work. In the Gaogang dewatering area, they implemented "dry a piece, plant a piece, dry and plant at the same time." In areas where spring planting was not possible, the transportation of firewood and grass for the Yi River project was completed ahead of schedule to reduce the contradiction of a lack of human and animal power during spring planting.

The time for replanting was urgent, and there was a shortage of manpower, cattle, and seeds. In addition, 6.6 million jin of firewood and grass for the Yi River project needed to be transported urgently, so spring planting was particularly difficult. The Shuyang County Government convened a district chief meeting in early May to understand the drainage situation. Aiming at a bumper harvest in one season, it could avoid or alleviate the famine. It arranged to check the disaster situation, carry out a spring planting blitz, implement the adjustment of labor, rectify mutual aid organizations, and correct the idea that production does not need leadership. It also increased the loan of seeds by 1.2 million jin, adjusted seeds by 350,000 jin, and purchased more than 60,000 jin of water-resistant crop seeds in order to plant more water-resistant crops. In spring planting, it focused on solving the spring planting difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and widowed, orphaned, and lonely households who had fled from the famine. On May 5, most of the low-lying areas in the county were dewatered. Encouraged by the imminent completion of the Yi River project and the hope of an autumn harvest, "men, women, old and young all worked together, and manpower, cattle, and tools were not idle," and they went all out to engage in spring planting. In Xiwu Township and other villages in the severely affected Hudong District, relief households participating in spring planting were given one jin of relief grain per person per day, implementing a combination of spring planting and relief. In order to solve the shortage of animal power, the method of using human power to pull seed drills was adopted. Each mu of spring field tilled by the drill was awarded one jin of grain. As a result, the efficiency of spring planting gradually increased. After rectifying mutual aid, Lao Liangzhuang, a severely affected village in Zhao Ji Township, also adopted a reward method. Seventeen seed drills in twenty groups completed planting 430 mu in three days. The Guaifen group of eight households and thirty-four people in Daliangzhuang, Tanggou District, combined agricultural and sideline occupations and completed spring planting in five days. As of May 17, 80% of the county's more than one million mu of spring fields had been planted. The rest are extremely low-lying areas, which will continue to plant a large number of upland rice in order to strive for no barren land and less barren land.

		Successfully Overcoming the Spring Famine
When the heavy rain in mid-April had not yet stopped, cadres at all levels took the initiative to express their determination to share life and death with the masses and be responsible to the end, in order to strengthen the confidence to overcome the famine. At the same time, according to the principle of self-reliance in production, in agriculture, a general planting of pumpkins and gourds was launched in homesteads, courtyards, highlands, and dry land. According to seasonal relations, the movement of weaving mats, folding paper, and weaving bamboo hats was further carried out. In the severely affected Hudong District, Honghong Township had 212 households folding paper before the spring flood. After the mobilization, it increased to 453 households. There were 500 people weaving bamboo hats in the two townships of Sandang and Gaozu. At the same time, an additional 1.2 million jin of relief grain and 200,000 jin of interest-free grain loans were issued. The general amount of relief for disaster victims was increased to about half a jin, and the amount of relief for disaster victims participating in drainage and spring planting was increased to one jin. By mid-May, the disaster situation was stable again.

		Having Confidence and Hope to Overcome the Summer Famine
Due to the heavy rain in mid-April, part of the wheat fields were flooded. Preliminary estimates in the county indicated that nearly 200,000 people had no wheat at all. In this part of the region, the summer famine had already formed. However, leaders at all levels had already made plans. In mid to late April, they mobilized the wheat-flooded areas to plant pumpkins and gourds. On May 10, Hudong District planted more than 1,500 mu of melons, with an average of more than six plants per person. Lao Liangzhuang Village, which had never had the habit of planting melons, planted an average of thirteen plants per person. The family of Liang Xianzhang, a member of workers and staff, planted 330 pumpkin plants. If fertilizer is applied, each plant can bear 40 to 50 jin of melons, which can solve all or most of the family's grain needs during the summer famine. In addition, the county and district still have a part of relief grain. It is planned to use the experience of spring planting to combine summer hoeing with relief. One to two jin of relief grain is given for hoeing one mu of land in order to stimulate production and increase the autumn harvest. At the same time, continued support is given to sideline production such as Guaifen paper folding and mat weaving. Now that social wealth has increased after the wheat harvest, free lending is advocated and a social mutual lending movement is launched, which adds favorable conditions for overcoming the summer famine. At present, the leaders of the county have full confidence in overcoming the wheat famine and even eradicating the disaster.

　　沭阳人民怎样战胜新的灾荒？
    舒汉涧
        严重的新的灾荒
    今年四月中旬大雨后，沭阳人民遭受了新的灾荒。全县一百二十一万多亩麦田，被淹六十六万九千多亩，已种春田五十八万多亩，亦有二十六万亩被淹。同时灾情发展，靠挖野菜及政府救济粮的灾民激增到二十一万人（雨前十七万人），且野菜大部被淹。导沂民工中靠以工贷赈养家的十二万灾民，由于阴雨连绵和积水过多，无法施工，亦有部分灾民赚不到工资。副业方面因大水围门原料缺乏，有的陷于停顿。原来把希望寄托在麦收上的灾民，现在看到麦田被淹，认为全年收成无望，悲观失望情绪滋长。
            全力完成春耕
    面对着这一严重的新的灾荒，沭阳党政军民即全力排水护麦，进行救急工作。在高岗脱水地区实行“干一块种一块，边干边种”。不能春种地区提前完成导沂柴草调运，减少春种时人畜力缺乏的矛盾。
    补种时间急迫，人牛籽种都很缺乏，加上六百六十万斤导沂柴草需要赶运，因之春种特别困难。沭阳县府在五月初召开区长会议，了解排水情况，针对丰收一季，便可避免或减轻灾荒，布置检查灾荒，突击春种，实行调剂劳力，整顿互助组织，纠正生产不要领导的思想。并增贷种籽一百二十万斤，调剂种籽三十五万斤，购买耐水庄稼种籽六万余斤，以便多种耐水庄稼。在春种中，着重解决烈军工属和鳏寡孤独逃荒户的春种困难。五月五号全县洼地大部脱水，在沂河即将完工，秋收有望的鼓舞下，“男女老少齐动手，人牛工具不失闲”，全力投入春种。重灾湖东区西圩乡等村，对参加春种的救济户，每人按天发给一斤救济粮，实行春种与救济结合。为了解决畜力困难，采用人力拉耩，每耩一亩春田，奖口粮一斤，结果春种效力逐渐提高。赵集乡重灾村老梁庄整顿互助后，亦采用奖励办法，二十组十七把耩三天耩完四百三十亩。塘沟区大梁庄拐粉组八户三十四人，实行农副业结合，五天即结束春种。截至五月十七日止，全县一百余万亩春田即有百分之八十完成下种。其余都是极洼地区，将继续种大批旱稻，以争取不荒地与少荒地。
            胜利度过春荒
    在四月中旬大雨还没有停止的时候，各级干部便主动向群众表明生死与共，负责到底的决心，以坚定度荒信心。同时根据生产自救为主的方针，在农业方面，发动宅基场园高岗旱地普种蕃瓜葫芦。根据季节关系，进一步开展织席、打折子、织斗笠运动，重灾区湖东区洫洪乡，春水前有二一二户打折子，经过发动后，即增至四五三户，三荡、高苴二乡即有五百人织斗笠。同时增发救济粮一百二十万斤，无利借粮二十万斤。对应救济灾民一般增到半斤左右，参加排水与春种灾民增发到一斤。至五月中旬，灾情复告稳定。
            有信心有希望地战胜夏荒
    四月中旬大雨，部分麦田被淹，全县初步估计，有近二十万人没有一粒麦子。这一部分地区，夏荒已经形成。但各级领导上已早有打算，在四月中旬下旬就动员淹麦区普种蕃瓜葫芦。湖东区五月十号即种下了一千五百余亩瓜，每人平均在六棵以上，一向没有种瓜习惯的老梁庄村，每人平均种了十三棵，工属梁宪章家，五口人，种蕃瓜三百三十棵，如果加工施肥，每棵结瓜四五十斤，可解决全部或大部夏荒的口粮。此外县区还有一部分救济粮，计划运用春耕经验，在夏锄中，结合夏锄进行救济，锄一亩地发救济粮一斤到二斤，以刺激生产，增加秋收。同时继续支持拐粉编席等副业生产。现在麦收后，社会财富增加，提倡自由借贷，开展社会互借运动，这样又增加了度过夏荒的有利条件。目前该县领导上，对战胜麦荒，以至根除灾荒，已具充分信心。
