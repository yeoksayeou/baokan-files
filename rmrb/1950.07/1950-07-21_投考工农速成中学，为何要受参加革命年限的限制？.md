　　Why is enrollment in Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools restricted by the length of revolutionary service? Comrades Fei Wen and Liu Rui:
    Your question has been answered by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government as follows:
    1. The enrollment requirements for Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools, in addition to being of worker or peasant origin, also include a restriction on the length of revolutionary service (three years or more). This is because: Firstly, these worker and peasant cadres who have participated in the revolution for many years have undergone a certain amount of practical revolutionary struggle (such as the tests of revolutionary war and land reform), and have higher political consciousness and richer revolutionary struggle experience than ordinary workers and peasants. They are the most outstanding members of the working class and peasantry. Secondly, due to the state's financial resources and lack of experience, the government cannot quickly establish a large number of Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools at present; therefore, only they can be selected for enrollment first.
    2. Worker and peasant cadres who already meet the enrollment requirements may not be able to enroll temporarily due to being indispensable to their work for the time being, or because their educational level is low despite meeting the enrollment requirements, or because of limited quotas. They should then concentrate on their work, study hard, prepare their conditions, and wait patiently, and strive for enrollment again when the opportunity arises. Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools will be established on a large scale in the future, and the opportunities for enrollment will increase year by year. The leadership will also consider the cadres' legitimate demands for learning.

### 投考工农速成中学，为何要受参加革命年限的限制？

　　投考工农速成中学，为何要受参加革命年限的限制？斐雯、刘瑞同志：
    你们的问题，现经中央人民政府教育部解答如下：
    一、工农速成中学规定入学条件，除了本人是工农出身以外，还要有参加革命年限（三年以上）的限制。这是因为：第一、这些参加革命多年的工农干部，经过了一定的革命实际斗争锻炼（如革命战争和土地改革的考验），比一般的工农具有较高的政治觉悟和比较丰富的革命斗争经验。他们是工农中最优秀的分子。第二、限于国家财力与缺乏经验，目前政府不能很快地大量举办工农速成中学；因此只能首先选拔他们入学。
    二、凡已具备入学条件的工农干部，在目前情况下，可能因为工作一时离不开，或虽具有入学条件而文化程度较低和限于设置名额等原因考不上，暂时不能入学，就要安心工作，努力学习，准备条件，耐心等候，俟有机会再争取入学。工农速成中学在今后是要大量开办的，入学的机会是一年比一年多，领导上也会考虑干部的正当学习要求。
