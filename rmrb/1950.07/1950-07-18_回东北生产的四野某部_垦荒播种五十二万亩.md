Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 14th: The units of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, which were transferred back to the Northeast this spring to participate in large-scale production, are now engaged in intensive summer hoeing on newly reclaimed land in the North Manchurian Plain and along the Songhua and Liao Rivers. All units have overfulfilled this year's land reclamation plan, with a total of over 524,000 mu reclaimed and sown. A certain unit stationed in Heilongjiang Province exceeded the original plan by more than 3,000 mu; a certain unit stationed in Songjiang Province also exceeded the plan by 14 percent.

　　After universally completing spring planting in early June, all units have successively and promptly engaged in summer hoeing. At present, the first and second hoeings have been basically completed in all areas, and efforts are being concentrated on the third hoeing. The hoeing efficiency of a certain unit has increased from two mu per person per day to more than six mu.

　　After arriving in the Northeast one after another this spring, the units began reclaiming land in the eastern foothills of the Xing'an Mountains and along the Songhua and Liao Rivers from mid-April. In the early spring cold and waist-deep snow of North Manchuria, they built their own houses, horse sheds, and granaries, constructing a total of more than 390 barracks and nearly 500 shacks, and digging more than 50 wells. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient draft horses during reclamation, some units even used manpower to pull plows for cultivation. The originally deserted wilderness has now seen countless new villages and boundless green seedlings.

　　While engaged in agricultural production, the units have also extracted a portion of their labor force to engage in various sideline productions. These include felling and transporting timber (using river water power), repairing railways and highways, charcoal burning, hunting, dike construction, and river digging. In just over two months, a certain unit stationed in Heilongjiang Province earned more than 18.7 billion yuan (Northeast currency) from contracting projects and doing odd jobs. A certain unit stationed in Songjiang Province had floated more than 370,000 cubic meters of timber by the end of last month, completing 70 percent of the unit's total timber floating plan. A certain company of a certain regiment participating in timber floating operations in the Lesser Xing'an Mountains cleared nine areas of densely packed boulders from the rivers in three days, allowing more than 130,000 cubic meters of timber to flow downstream, saving the state nearly 600 million yuan in stone work and explosives expenses. The company was commended by the Northeast Forestry Bureau for this.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 15th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, which was transferred back to the Northeast from the Central and Southern Region for production, is now making every effort to carry out various production and construction tasks. The unit was transferred back to the Northeast from the Central and Southern Region in March of this year, and after more than a month of marching, arrived in the Northeast reclamation area in mid-April. A certain cavalry division of the unit, passing through Beijing, was reviewed by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De on April 2nd. Commander-in-Chief Zhu exhorted the officers and soldiers of the unit to work hard to increase national wealth after arriving in the Northeast. After arriving in the Northeast, the unit was warmly welcomed by the people of the Northeast. The Northeast People's Government also organized a comfort delegation, led by Vice Chairman Gao Chongmin, to visit the unit in the reclamation area.

　　After arriving in the Northeast, the unit carried out large-scale reclamation work in the North Manchurian Plain and along the Songhua and Liao Rivers. The guards and communication personnel of each unit were reduced as much as possible, and the cadres handling daily work did the work of two people, extracting all the manpower that could be extracted for production. As of early July, the unit had reclaimed and sown more than 524,000 mu. While carrying out large-scale agricultural production, the unit also engaged in logging, repairing railways and highways, charcoal burning, hunting, dike construction, and river digging projects, and has already made great achievements.

　　Because the Northeast is vast and sparsely populated, and the reclamation areas are mostly in the desolate wilderness, more than 100 li away from the stationed areas, food and accommodation are extremely difficult. After arriving in the Northeast, the officers and soldiers of the unit immediately went to the deep mountains to fell trees and cut grass in the freezing cold, building their own houses, horse sheds, and granaries. Up to now, they have built more than 390 barracks and nearly 500 shacks in the reclamation area, and dug more than 50 wells. Now, countless brand-new farmhouses have been built on the boundless grassland.

　　回东北生产的四野某部
    垦荒播种五十二万亩
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】人民解放军第四野战军今春调回东北参加大生产的各部队，现在正在北满大平原和松花江、辽河两岸新开垦的土地上紧张地进行夏锄。各部已超额完成今年的垦荒计划，垦荒播种总数共达五十二万四千余亩。驻黑龙江省某部播种超过原计划三千余亩；驻松江省某部亦超过计划百分之十四。
    各部自六月上旬普遍结束春耕后，已先后及时投入夏锄。目前各地头二遍锄草均已基本结束，正以全力进行三遍铲趟。某部的锄草效率已由每人每天二亩提高至六亩以上。
    各部于今春先后抵达东北后，自四月中旬开始即分别在兴安岭东麓和松花江、辽河两岸进行垦荒。在北满初春的严寒和齐腰的积雪中，自己动手修建住宅、马棚和粮仓，共计修盖营房三百九十余间和窝棚近五百座，打井五十余个。在开垦中为了克服耕马不足的困难，有些部队并以人力拉犁进行耕种。原来一片渺无人烟的荒野，现在已经出现了无数的新村和一望无际的青苗。
    在从事农业生产的同时，各部还抽出一部分劳动力从事各种副业生产。其中包括砍伐流送（利用河流水力输送）木材，修补铁路、公路，烧炭，打猎，筑堤，挖河等。驻黑龙江省某部在两个多月内包揽工程和做零工的收入已达一百八十七亿余元（东北币），驻松江省某部队上月底已流送木材三十七万余立方米，完成了该部全部流送木材计划的百分之七十。在小兴安岭参加木材流送作业的某团某连，以三天时间清除了九处河流中的杂乱密集的巨石，使十三万余立方米的木材得以顺流而下，为国家节省石工和炸药的开支近六亿元，该连因而受到东北林务总局的表扬。
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】由中南区调回东北生产的人民解放军第四野战军某部，正以全力进行各项生产建设工作。该部于今年三月间由中南区调回东北，经月余行军后，于四月中旬抵达东北垦区。该部某骑兵师路经北京时，曾于四月二日接受朱总司令的检阅。朱总司令训勉该部指战员抵达东北后，应为增加国家财富而努力生产。该部抵达东北后，受到东北人民的热烈欢迎。东北人民政府并组织了慰劳团，由副主席高崇民率领前往垦区慰问该部。
    该部抵达东北后，即在北满大平原和松花江、辽河两岸进行了大规模的开垦工作。各单位警卫人员、通讯人员均尽量缩减，处理日常工作的干部一个人要做两人的事，抽调出一切可以抽调的人力投入生产。截至七月上旬，该部已垦荒播种五十二万四千余亩。与进行大规模农业生产的同时，该部并从事伐木、修补铁路和公路、烧炭、打猎、筑堤、挖河等工程，并已有了很大的成绩。
    由于东北地广人稀，垦区多在荒漠无垠的荒野中，距离驻地远达百余里，食住均极困难。该部指战员抵达东北后，立即在冰天雪地中，赶赴深山中伐木、割草，自己动手修建住宅、马棚和粮仓。截至目前止，他们已在垦区修盖了三百九十多间营房，近五百座窝棚，打了五十多个井。现在在一望无际的草原上，已建筑起了无数崭新的农庄。
