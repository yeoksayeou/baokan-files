　　Vietnamese Foreign Minister Issues Statement
　　Condemns U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against Korea, China, and Vietnam
　　[Xinhua News Agency, July 17th] According to Vietnam News Agency, Vietnamese Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Hoang Minh Giam issued a statement on the 15th, denouncing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea, China, and Vietnam, stating: U.S. imperialism instructed Syngman Rhee to launch a civil war and shamelessly used the name of the United Nations to carry out aggression against Korea. U.S. imperialism further seized this opportunity to occupy Taiwan and further interfere in the Vietnamese people's liberation war. In Vietnam, after a period of indirect aid, U.S. imperialism is now increasingly providing direct aid to the puppet Bao Dai: loaning him money, sending him military equipment, and trying to get his representatives the right to join certain technical agencies of the United Nations.
　　Hoang Minh Giam emphasized: U.S. imperialism is attempting to undermine the independence and unification of Korea, China, Vietnam, and other countries in Asia and Europe. However, they are bound to be completely defeated. The Chinese people will surely be able to liberate Taiwan. The Korean people will surely be able to defeat the Syngman Rhee puppet and the American aggressors. The Vietnamese people will surely be able to eliminate the Bao Dai puppet and French colonialists.
　　Hoang Minh Giam forcefully stated: The Vietnamese people warmly support the Korean people and hope that they will achieve a swift victory.

　　越南外长发表声明
    斥美帝侵略朝中越
    【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴于十五日发表声明，斥责美帝国主义对朝鲜、中国和越南的侵略称：美帝国主义指使李承晚发动内战，并无耻地盗用联合国的名义实行对朝鲜的侵略。美帝国主义更利用这一机会占领台湾，并进一步地干涉越南人民的解放战争。在越南，经过了一段间接援助的时期以后，美帝国主义现正日益增加地给予傀儡保大以直接援助：贷款给他，把军事装备送给他，替他的代表争取加入联合国若干技术性机构的权利。
    黄明鉴着重指出：美帝国主义正在企图破坏朝鲜、中国、越南以及亚洲和欧洲其他国家的独立和统一。但是，他们是要遭到完全失败的。中国人民一定能够解放台湾。朝鲜人民一定能够打垮李承晚傀儡和美国侵略者。越南人民一定能够消灭保大傀儡和法国殖民主义者。
    黄明鉴力称：越南人民热诚地支持朝鲜人民，并且希望他们迅速地得到胜利。
