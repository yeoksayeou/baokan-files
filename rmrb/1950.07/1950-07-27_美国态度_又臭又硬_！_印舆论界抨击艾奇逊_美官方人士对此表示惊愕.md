Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New Delhi on the 20th: Although Indian officials have not been vehement about Acheson's rejection of Nehru's proposal, Indian political and public opinion circles are deeply angered and call it the failure of India's initiative. Members of Congress, Socialists, members of the Mahasabha, Sikhs, and members of other parties have condemned Acheson's note, praising Marshal Stalin's completely different attitude towards Nehru's proposal. The most common opinion is that the United States' "smelly and hard" attitude has had an unprecedentedly bad influence. Agence France-Presse, Washington, July 21st, also stated that Indian newspapers have almost unanimously condemned Acheson's response to Nehru's note. This matter has caused astonishment among U.S. officials.

    【新华社二十三日讯】据法新社新德里二十日讯：虽然印度官方人士对艾奇逊拒绝尼赫鲁建议的态度并不激烈，但印度政界与舆论界则深为激怒，称之为印度倡议的破灭。国会人士，社会党人，大乘会会员，锡克教徒和其他党派人士纷纷谴责艾奇逊的照会，他们盛赞斯大林大元帅对尼赫鲁建议所采取的截然不同的态度。最为普遍的意见是：美国的“又臭又硬”的态度，已产生了从来没有过的恶劣影响。法新社华盛顿二十一日电又称，印度报纸几乎一致谴责艾奇逊对尼赫鲁照会的答复。此事已引起了美国官方人士的惊愕。
