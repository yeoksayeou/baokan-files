　　Saving Manpower and Material Resources, Improving Work Efficiency
    Ministry of Railways Streamlines Reports
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has streamlined its reports to save manpower and material resources and improve work efficiency. Starting in July, of the 363 types of reports originally submitted by the various railway bureaus to the ministry, 104 types that were completely unnecessary have been abolished, and 73 types with shortcomings have been revised. In addition, 49 new types of reports that were practically needed but not available in the past have been added. In the past, the Ministry of Railways requested reports from various railway bureaus without a unified plan, resulting in some being duplicated and others being submitted even though they were no longer practically needed. For example, the Factory Affairs Bureau and the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways used to simultaneously request reports on vehicle delivery from various railway factories. After research, it was decided that only one copy needs to be submitted to the Factory Affairs Bureau. In the past, railway bureaus reported transportation overviews to the Ministry of Railways in the form of daily, ten-day, and monthly reports. After revision, the accuracy of daily reports has been strengthened, and the ten-day and monthly reports have been abolished to eliminate duplication. In the past, although there were many reports, important items were often omitted. For example, the monthly report on sleeper replacement issued by the Public Works Bureau lacked an important survey of sleeper wood quality. The Ministry of Railways began streamlining reports in May, led by the Statistics Department of the ministry, with the participation of relevant departments, and organized a report review committee. After a month of careful research, preliminary streamlining of reports was achieved. Streamlining reports will save a great deal of manpower and material resources. The abolished reports in the locomotive field alone will save each locomotive depot and car inspection depot across the country at least 20,000 forms per month. Streamlining reports not only does not hinder business needs but also makes it easier to achieve accurate statistics. For example, in terms of transportation, the report on the transportation overview has improved "reliability" after simplification, which is of great help in solving problems in a timely manner.

　　节省人力物力提高工作效率
    铁道部精简表报
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府铁道部为节省人力物力，提高工作效率，精简了表报。自七月份起，原来各铁路局对该部填送的三百六十三种表报中，有一百零四种完全不需要填送的已经废止；有缺点的七十三种已经修改。另外增加了有实际需要而过去没有的四十九种新表报。过去铁道部向各路局要表报，没有统一的计划，因而有的互相重复，有的目前已无实际需要而仍在填送。如铁道部厂务局和机务局过去同时向各铁路工厂要车辆出厂的报告，这次经过研究，只要填送一份给厂务局就够了。过去各路局向铁道部报告运输概况，有日报、旬报、月报三种，经过修改后，现在加强日报的准确性，取消了旬报和月报，免去重复。过去表报虽然繁多，而重要项目却往往遗漏。如工务总局发出的枕木抽换月报中，便缺少一项重要的枕木木质调查。铁道部精简表报的工作是从五月开始的，由该部统计处主持，各有关部门参加，组织了表报审查委员会；经过一月的缜密研究，始做到表报的初步精简。表报精简后将节省很大的人力物力。仅机务方面废止的表报，使全国各机务段、检车段每月至少可少填两万多张。表报精简后不但不妨碍业务需要，更易做到精确的统计。如运输方面运输概况的报告，由于简化后提高了“可靠度”，对及时解决问题有很大的帮助。
