　　Various Schools Arrange Summer Production Work
    [From Our Correspondent] With the summer vacation approaching, various schools in Beijing are actively arranging summer production work in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal School Production Steering Committee. Most schools have already begun registering the number of students staying on campus to participate in production and formulating plans for the summer vacation period; many faculty and staff members staying on campus have also joined the summer production work. Due to large student turnover during the summer vacation, Municipal No. 7 Middle School has organized a temporary summer production committee, assigning specific personnel to lead the work and formulating a detailed work schedule. Every day, one faculty member and one worker will lead the students in work. For summer production at Xin Zhi Middle School, more than 20 faculty members and more than 200 students have registered to participate, including more than 60 graduating students who cannot leave for the time being. The summer production work at Sino-French University began on the 2nd of this month. In addition to the more than 200 students staying on campus, most of the students and workers living in the city have also participated. The school's production committee has also decided to strengthen the reporting system, urge and inspect, in order to ensure the completion of the summer production tasks. Girls' No. 3 Middle School has more than 450 students participating in the summer production work. Hebei High School, Beijing Normal University, Huiwen Middle School and other schools have not made major changes to their summer production organizations. Hebei High School and Huiwen Middle School each have more than 300 students participating in summer production.
