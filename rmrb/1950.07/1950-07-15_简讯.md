            Gu'an Flood Prevention and Rescue Initially Triumphs Over Floods
    After completing all flood prevention preparations on June 29th, the Flood Prevention Headquarters of Gu'an County, Hebei Province, immediately received intelligence about rising water levels upstream the following day. They immediately mobilized urgently to conduct inspections, urgently erected telephone lines along both sides of the riverbank overnight, and prepared for rescue operations. At midnight on the same day, the water flow surged sharply, exceeding last year's highest water level by 1.2 meters. The river embankment experienced four incidents, especially at the Shifosi dangerous section, where the embankment cracked and the mattress collapsed, posing a serious threat. However, thanks to the emergency repairs by the masses, the situation turned from danger to safety, and the first victory in flood prevention was achieved.
