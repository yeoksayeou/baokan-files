　　Ancient Dinosaur Fossils Discovered in Jingangkou Village, South of Laiyang City, Shandong Province
　　[Our Newspaper] Teachers and students of the Department of Geology and Mineralogy of Shandong University discovered dinosaur fossils dating back approximately 100 million years during an internship. In April of this year, students from the department, led by Mr. Guan Guangyue and Mr. Wang Linxiang, discovered several dinosaur egg fossils, a pair of hind leg calf bones, as well as vertebrae, tail bones, ribs, and toe bones near Jingangkou Village, 20 li south of Laiyang City, Shandong Province. The calf bones are three and a half chi tall. Based on this, it is estimated that the dinosaur's back height was about eleven chi. The fossils were discovered in the "Wangshi Formation" in Laiyang County, which, geologically speaking, dates back about 100 million years. Dinosaurs were an ancient type of herbivorous reptile, with a large body, strong limbs, and a robust and long tail. Dinosaur egg fossils were first discovered in Mongolia in 1921 by the American Asiatic Expedition; the discovery in Laiyang is the second such discovery in the world.

　　山东莱阳城南金岗口村发现古代恐龙化石
    【本报讯】山东大学地质矿物系师生，在实习中发现了距今约有一万万年以前的恐龙化石。今年四月间，该系学生在关广岳、王麟祥两先生率领下，在山东莱阳县实习时，在莱阳城南二十里的金岗口村附近发现了恐龙蛋化石数枚，后肢小腿骨一对，尚有脊椎骨、尾骨、肋骨、足趾骨等。小腿骨高三尺半，据此估计，恐龙脊背之高约在十一尺上下。此项化石发现于莱阳县的“王氏层”中，就地质时期言，距今约有一万万年之久。按恐龙为古代的一种食草爬行动物，体格庞大，四肢强壮，尾健而长。恐龙蛋化石第一次是在一九二一年由美国亚洲调查队在蒙古发现；此次在莱阳所得者系世界上第二次的发现。（山东大学地质矿物系）
