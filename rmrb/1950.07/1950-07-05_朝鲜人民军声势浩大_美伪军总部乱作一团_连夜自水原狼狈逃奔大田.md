　　The Korean People's Army is Mighty
　　US-Puppet Army Headquarters is in Utter Chaos
　　Escaping from Suwon to Daejeon in Disarray Overnight

[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] Under the surging momentum of the Korean People's Army, the paranoid US Field Army Headquarters in Korea and the Syngman Rhee puppet army headquarters, amidst rumors of an imminent attack, fled in chaos from Suwon to Daejeon on the night of June 30th. According to the United Press, this was solely because "the sound of northern artillery fire was heard from afar (presumed to be bombarding Suwon), and the southern troops began to flee south."

According to Reuters, describing the panicked state of the US military at the time: "When the US headquarters discovered that the personnel of the South Korean headquarters were getting into vehicles to retreat, they hurriedly rushed to the Suwon airfield, with only a few minutes to burn documents and destroy unnecessary vehicles." Brigadier General Church, commander of the US military headquarters in Korea, "only realized the retreat when he saw his personnel burning the headquarters and airport equipment. Church's approximately 300 staff and attached personnel rushed in disarray onto 50 trucks and jeeps, and within fifteen minutes of the first air raid alert, headed straight for Daejeon. The entire team trudged for eight hours in torrential rain to reach Daejeon, and to this day it is unknown who issued the retreat order."

According to the Associated Press, describing the US military's chaotic state: Personnel at the US headquarters in Suwon "raced out of Suwon, heavily trudging 93 miles in torrential rain," heading straight for Daejeon. Before fleeing, they set fire to the agricultural school where the US military headquarters was located, abandoning a considerable amount of supplies and equipment. Some people "feared they were not retreating fast enough."

A United Press dispatch from Daejeon on the 1st stated: "Approximately 280 soaked and exhausted American soldiers arrived in Daejeon this morning after a ten-hour retreat from Suwon." "Corporal Miller, while attempting to jump over a levee to get on a jeep when the retreat began, broke his leg"; during the retreat, "Corporal Araudz fell asleep while holding onto the jeep's steering wheel, resulting in the car falling into a ditch and throwing his three companions out of the vehicle."

 　  朝鲜人民军声势浩大
     美伪军总部乱作一团
     连夜自水原狼狈逃奔大田
    【新华社三日讯】在朝鲜人民军汹涌挺进的声势下，草木皆兵的美国驻朝鲜的野战军司令部和李承晚伪军总司令部，在六月三十日夜间乱做一团地从水原狼狈逃抵大田。据合众社称：这仅因为“远远听到了北方大炮声（猜测是轰击水原的）和南方部队开始向南逃跑”。
    据路透社报道美军当时慌张的情形称：“美军总部在发现南朝鲜总部人员爬上汽车撤退时，就急忙拥进水原飞机场前，只有几分钟的时间去烧毁文件及炸毁不需要的车辆。”朝鲜美军总部的指挥官邱奇准将“在看到自己的人员在烧毁总部和机场的设备时，才知道撤退的事。邱奇的三百名左右参谋及附属人员乱成一团地拥上五十部卡车和吉普车，在首次空袭警报发出后的十五分钟之内，就直奔大田而去。全队人马在倾盆大雨下跋涉八小时抵达大田，迄今尚不知撤退令为何人所下。”
    另据美联社报道美军这一狼狈情形称：水原美军总部人员，“竞相奔出水原，在倾盆大雨中，沉重地赶了九十三英里路程”，直赴大田。他们在临逃前，放火烧掉美军司令部所在地的农业学校，并遗弃数目可观的物资装备。有些人“唯恐撤退得不够快”。
    合众社大田一日电称：“约有二百八十名湿透了的精疲力竭的美国军人，由水原作了十小时的退却后，于今晨到达大田。”“宪兵伍长米勒在撤退开始时，为了跳过一道堤防，登上吉普，而折断了他的腿”；在撤退途中，“阿劳德兹伍长扶着吉普车的轮盘打瞌睡，结果把车掉到沟里，把他的三个同伴摔出车外。”
