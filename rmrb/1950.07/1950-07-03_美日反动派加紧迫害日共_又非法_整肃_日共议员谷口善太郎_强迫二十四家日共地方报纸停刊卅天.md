Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries continue to ferociously persecute the Japanese Communist Party. According to Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo: The Yoshida government, based on the so-called "purge order," decided on June 29th to "purge" JCP Diet member Zentaro Taniguchi because Taniguchi, on the 27th, issued a stern statement to reporters regarding the illegal order to suspend publication of the Akahata newspaper, denouncing the Yoshida government for using the "purge order" and the so-called "Group Regulation Ordinance" to conduct extreme anti-democratic activities. It is noted that Zentaro Taniguchi is a member of the JCP's provisional central leadership body and was designated as the party's spokesperson on the 22nd, replacing Ito Ritsu, who was illegally "purged" on June 6th.

Furthermore, according to a United Press report, following MacArthur's directive on the 26th ordering the Yoshida government to suspend publication of the JCP's central organ newspaper, Akahata, for thirty days, Japanese police, on June 28th, forced twenty-four JCP local newspapers to cease publication for thirty days. The police claimed that this measure was taken in accordance with "the meaning contained" in MacArthur's directive to Yoshida ordering the suspension of Akahata. In addition, the police closed the printing plant of Akahata and all the equipment of the local newspapers that were forced to suspend publication. According to Kyodo News Agency: Under the direction of the Special Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department dispatched more than 50 police officers on the afternoon of June 28th, with the support of various police stations, to search more than 20 JCP district committees in Tokyo and confiscated the JCP local newspapers that were forced to suspend publication.

　　美日反动派加紧迫害日共
    又非法“整肃”日共议员谷口善太郎
    强迫二十四家日共地方报纸停刊卅天
    【新华社二日讯】美日反动派继续凶恶地迫害日本共产党。据共同社东京讯：吉田政府根据所谓“整肃令”又于六月二十九日决定“整肃”日共众议员谷口善太郎，因为谷口于二十七日曾对赤旗报被非法勒令停刊一事，向记者团发表严正声明，斥责吉田政府利用“整肃令”及所谓“团体等规正令”，进行极端的反民主活动。按谷口善太郎为日共临时中央领导机关委员，并于二十二日被指定为党的发言人，以代替六月六日被非法“整肃”的伊藤律。
    另据合众社讯，继麦克阿瑟于二十六日指令吉田政府勒令日共中央机关报赤旗报停刊三十天后，日本警察又于六月二十八日强迫二十四家日共地方报纸停刊三十天。警察声称他们这一措施，是按照麦克阿瑟指令吉田勒令赤旗报停刊的信中“所包含的意思行事”。此外，警察并封闭了赤旗报的印刷厂以及被迫停刊的各地方报纸的一切设备。又据共同社讯：东京警察局在法务府特别审查局的指使下，于六月二十八日下午派遣警官五十余名，在各警察分局的支援下，搜查东京二十余处日共地区委员会，并没收了被迫停刊的日共地方报纸。
