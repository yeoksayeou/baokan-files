　　Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd dispatch: According to TASS news: Factories and organizations in Moscow held mass rallies on the 1st, unanimously protesting the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Korea.

　　At these rallies, the Soviet working people, with the greatest indignation, denounced the provocative actions of the American ruling clique in Korea, and their cruel bombing and slaughter of peaceful residents. The resolutions of these rallies emphatically stated that the U.S. imperialist armed intervention in Korea is an attack by warmongers on all peace-loving people in the world. The Soviet people sympathize with the Korean people who are fighting for their freedom and independence. Meetings everywhere demanded the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea and the cessation of arms aid to the Lee Seung-man puppet "government."

　　Worker representatives speaking at the meetings warned U.S. imperialists to heed the voices of millions of Soviet people, and emphasized that the Soviet people will more actively strive for peace and the security of all countries, and consolidate the power of the bulwark of world peace—the Soviet Union.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd dispatch: TASS dispatch from Tokyo on the 2nd: The Japanese people resolutely protest the U.S. aggression against Korea. On June 26th, all day laborers in Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama City, refused to be recruited to Yokosuka to load munitions to be shipped to South Korea. Workers of the Dai Nippon Printing Company opposed MacArthur Headquarters' order for them to print 250,000 copies of Korean-language leaflets. Japanese police arrested three leaders of printing workers' unions. The Labor News commented on the current situation, saying: "The imperialists blatantly want to provoke a so-called 'hot' war. They are turning Japan into a military base, making Japan subject to their aggressive plans."

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd dispatch: TASS dispatch from Berlin on the 1st: The U.S. aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has aroused a tide of protest among progressive members of society in Germany. In mass rallies and gatherings held in major cities and towns of the German Democratic Republic, working people protested the actions of the imperialist aggressors, unanimously saying: "Hands off Korea!"

　　50,000 residents of Halle held a meeting on June 29th, resolutely protesting the bandit-like invasion of the Korean Republic by the American puppet, and protesting the U.S. imperialist intervention. The conference declared that it stood with the Korean people fighting for freedom.

　　The 15,000 employees of the "Leuna" factory also passed a similar resolution. Tens of thousands of residents of Dresden held a meeting on June 29th to protest U.S. imperialist interference in Korea's internal affairs. When the spokesperson of the Free German Trade Union Federation announced that 158 peace committees had been established in Dresden's enterprises in response to U.S. imperialist provocations in Korea, the entire venue erupted in stormy cheers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd dispatch: TASS dispatch from Rome on the 2nd: The Executive Committee of the Italian National Partisan Association issued a statement denouncing the "despicable act of armed aggression by the United States," stating: "Because of the American aggression, thousands of Koreans are dying today, and tomorrow, perhaps thousands of Italians will die because of the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty."

　　The Executive Committee announced its support for the Italian Peace Committee's demands, demanding that Italy withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty, and calling for the expansion of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign. The statement concluded: "Stop the U.S. intervention in Korea! Declare the atomic bomb illegal! Abolish Italy's military obligations!"

　　The Secretariat of the Italian Land Constituent Assembly (an organization uniting vast numbers of impoverished peasants and agricultural workers) issued a statement demanding an end to U.S. aggression against Korea.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd dispatch: TASS dispatch from New York on the 2nd: Latin American progressive newspapers reflect the people's indignation at U.S. intervention in the Far East. "Noticias de Hoy," published in Havana, Cuba, resolutely condemned the U.S. armed intervention in Korea. The newspaper called on the Cuban people to intensify the struggle to win peace and oppose the sinister conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. "Puerto Rico Libre," published in San Juan, Puerto Rico, published a special article entitled "A Sinister U.S. Fascist Clique Provokes War in Asia," resolutely condemning U.S. intervention in Korea.

　　According to "Noticias de Hoy," the Cuban Democratic Women's League issued a statement calling on women across the country to resolutely condemn U.S. intervention in Korea and intensify the signature campaign demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons.
