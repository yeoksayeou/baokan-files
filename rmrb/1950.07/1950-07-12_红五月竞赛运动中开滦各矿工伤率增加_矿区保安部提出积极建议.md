　　During the Red May Competition, the Injury Rate Increased in Kailuan Mines; Mining Area Security Department Proposed Positive Suggestions
    [Our Newspaper, Tangshan News] Since the launch of the Red May production competition in the Kailuan mines, although new production records for the past six years have been continuously set, the injury rate has also increased significantly. For example, in the Tangjiazhuang No. 1 mine, an average of over a hundred people were injured daily in May. This was due to the lack of thorough safety education, failure to strictly implement safety rules, and infrequent inspections. To this end, the Security Department of the Kailuan Mining Area Committee conducted a safety inspection in late May and suggested that the mine authorities earnestly implement the resolutions of the labor-management consultation meetings and establish a safety responsibility system. The mine authorities have now indicated their acceptance and have partially corrected the situation.

　　红五月竞赛运动中开滦各矿工伤率增加
    矿区保安部提出积极建议
    【本报唐山讯】开滦各矿自展开红五月生产竞赛运动后，虽连创了六年来的生产新纪录，但工伤率却也有显著增加。如唐家庄一矿，五月份平均每日伤百余人，这是由于保安教育不深入，没有严格执行保安规则，加之检查不勤所致。为此，开滦矿区委员会保安部曾于五月下旬进行了安全检查，并建议矿方，确实执行劳资协商会议的决议，建立安全负责制。现矿方已表示接受，并部分加以纠正。
