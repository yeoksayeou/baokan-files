　　Listens Only to American Orders
    Britain Rejects Nehru's Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th] Following the U.S. government, the British government has also rejected Nehru's proposal for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, British Prime Minister Attlee telegraphed Nehru on the 19th, rejecting his proposal "in the same way as the U.S. government." Attlee stated that the British government fully supports the United Nations Security Council's resolution, illegally passed under American manipulation, regarding armed intervention in Korea's internal affairs, and it cannot change this stance. Attlee also announced the same attitude on the 20th in the British House of Commons when reporting on the several discussions between Britain and the Soviet Union on the Korean issue.

　　唯美国之命是听
    英拒绝尼赫鲁建议
    【新华社二十四日讯】英国政府已继美国政府之后，拒绝尼赫鲁关于和平处理朝鲜问题的建议。据路透社伦敦讯，英国首相艾德礼于十九日电复尼赫鲁，“和美国政府一样地”拒绝了尼赫鲁的建议。艾德礼表示：英国政府完全支持联合国安全理事会在美国操纵下非法通过的关于武装干涉朝鲜内政的决议，它不能改变这一态度。艾德礼二十日在英下院报告英苏数度商谈朝鲜问题时亦宣布了同样的态度。
