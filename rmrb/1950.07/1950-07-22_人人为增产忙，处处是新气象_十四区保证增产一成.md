　　Everyone is Busy Increasing Production, Everywhere is a New Atmosphere
    Fourteenth District Guarantees a 10% Increase in Production
    [Report from this newspaper] After the land reform in the Fourteenth District of Beijing's suburbs, the farmers in the entire district completed the repairs of the Feng River and Liang River, allowing more than 80,000 mu of land on both banks to be free from flooding; they increased the application of fertilizer by a total of more than 5.4 million jin of manure; they also reclaimed wasteland, dug wells, added waterwheels, increased paddy fields, and engaged in intensive cultivation. This year, they can increase corn production by approximately 5.93 million jin, accounting for 11.8% of the total harvest. The plan to increase production by 10% is already assured. Farmers in the entire district are now working hard to hoe one more time. Women, monks, idlers, landlords, etc., who did not work in the fields in previous years, have also mostly joined the labor force. This shows a new atmosphere where everyone is busy increasing production.
    The Feng River and its tributaries in the district run through the southern half of the Fourteenth District, and there are more than 100,000 mu of low-lying land on both banks. Under enemy and puppet rule, the rivers were in disrepair for many years, and the land along the banks was often flooded. Last year, there was a lot of rain, and more than 70,000 mu of land on both sides of the Feng River had no harvest. After the completion of land reform this spring, the district government of the Fourteenth District launched more than 10,000 farmers in early March and early May in two work-for-relief projects to dredge the Feng River and Liang River. A total of 55 li of river channel and 5 channels of 70 li of tributaries were dug. The farmers themselves also dug and dredged many rivers and canals. After this dredging, the rivers are unobstructed, and under normal rainfall conditions, the land on both banks can be normally cultivated. If each mu increases production by 25 jin of corn, a total of more than 2 million jin can be increased.
    This spring, the district government called for a 10% increase in production, planning to increase fertilizer by 30 jin per mu. Thanks to the farmers in the villages actively accumulating fertilizer and the government providing fertilizer loans, the entire district has exceeded the planned target. The ten villages including Longzhua Tree Yinghai Village have a total of 64,304 mu of land. Last year, an average of one cart of fertilizer was applied to every 4.5 mu, and this year, an average of one cart per 3 mu. This year, the government lent the district a total of more than 690,000 jin of manure and more than 865,000 jin of soybean cake (one jin of soybean cake is equivalent to four jin of manure). Farmers have accumulated 6,500 more carts of fertilizer than in previous years (each cart is equivalent to 200 jin of manure), which can increase corn production by approximately 1.36 million jin.
    With the loan assistance of the district government, this year, the entire district has dug 91 new brick wells and new earth wells, repaired 61 brick wells and 267 earth wells. 172 waterwheels have been added, expanding the paddy fields by more than 4,300 mu. Calculated at 150 jin per mu in the first season, a total of more than 650,000 jin of corn will be produced.
    Many farmers have turned low-lying and alkaline land into paddy fields or bucket fields. The entire district has newly opened 158.5 mu of paddy fields and bucket fields. At the same time, many farmers have reclaimed wasteland along the edges of the fields and roads. This year, the entire district has reclaimed 664 mu of wasteland. If each mu of paddy field produces the equivalent of 100 jin of corn and dry land produces 80 jin of corn, more than 68,000 jin of corn can be produced.
    This year, the district has increased the planting of cotton and sweet potatoes compared to last year. Cotton fields have increased by 1,231 mu, and sweet potato fields have increased by 756 mu. The two together can increase corn production by approximately 159,000 jin. In addition, according to statistics from 22 villages, there are already 3,280 mu of land for planting wheat stubble sweet potatoes (500 mu last year). This increase in production has not yet been included.
    In terms of intensive cultivation, the entire district's weeding work has been completed to the normal level. Now, farmers in the entire district are being mobilized to work hard for one more weeding. In some areas, such as the Xizhi River area, farmers have weeded four times. If each additional weeding increases corn production by 7 jin per mu, the entire district can increase production by more than 1.68 million jin.
    If there are no special unexpected disasters this year, the Fourteenth District will be able to complete the task of increasing production by 10%.

　　人人为增产忙，处处是新气象
    十四区保证增产一成
    【本报讯】京郊十四区土地改革后，全区农民修竣了凤河、凉河，使两岸八万余亩土地免受涝灾；增施了肥料合大粪五百四十余万斤；又开荒、打井、添水车、增水田、精耕细作；总共今年可增产玉米约五百九十三万余斤，占总收成百分之十一点八，增产一成的计划已有把握。全区农民现正努力多锄一遍，往年不下地的妇女、和尚、二流子、地主等，也多已参加劳动。表现出：人人为增加生产而忙碌起来的新气象。
    该区凤河及其支渠横穿十四区南半部，两岸洼地有十万余亩，敌伪统治下多年失修，沿岸土地常年受涝。去年雨水多，凤河两岸就有七万多亩土地没有收成。今春完成土地改革后，十四区区政府于三月初及五月初两次以工代赈发动了万余农民，疏浚了凤河及凉河。共挖河身长达五十五里，支渠五道长七十余里。农民自己并挖掘、疏浚了不少河渠。经此番疏浚后，河流畅通，如在普通雨量情形下，两岸土地均可正常生产。每亩如按增产二十五斤玉米计，共可增产二百余万斤。
    今春该区政府号召增产一成，计划每亩增肥三十斤，由于各村农民积极积肥，及政府贷肥，全区均已超计划完成。龙爪树瀛海庄等十个村共有土地六万四千三百零四亩，去年平均每四亩半施肥一车，今年平均每三亩一车。今年政府共贷给该区大粪六十九万余斤、豆饼八十六万五千余斤（豆饼一斤合大粪四斤），农民比常年多积肥六千五百余车（每车合大粪二百斤），约可增产玉米一百三十六万余斤。
    在该区政府贷款扶助下，今年全区共打新砖井及新土井各九十一眼，修理砖井六十一眼、土井二百六十七眼。增添水车一百七十二辆，共扩大水田四千三百余亩，按每亩第一季产一百五十斤计，共增产玉米六十五万余斤。
    很多农民将洼地、碱地开成了水地或桶子地。全区新开水地桶子地一百五十八亩半。同时很多农民将地边、道边荒地开垦，今年全区共开荒地六百六十四亩。如以每亩水地生产折合百斤玉米、旱地八十斤玉米计，可增产玉米六万八千余斤。
    该区今年种植棉花及白薯均比去年增加。棉田增加一千二百三十一亩，白薯田增加七百五十六亩。两者共约增产玉米十五万九千余斤。另据二十二个村统计，种麦楂白薯地已有三千二百八十亩（去年为五百亩），此项增产，尚未计入。
    精耕细作方面，全区锄地工作已完成常年水平，现正动员全区农民为多锄一遍而努力。若干地区如西直河一带农民，已锄过四遍。如按多锄一遍每亩增产玉米七斤计，全区可增产一百六十八万余斤。
    今年如无特殊意外灾害，十四区即可完成增产一成的任务。
