[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The case of citizen Ma Liangui's appeal that the death of his eight-year-old daughter, Ma Shunhua, was related to BCG vaccination, has been thoroughly investigated by the Municipal People's Court. Based on the autopsy, it was determined that Ma Shunhua's death was caused by acute interstitial pneumonia and a weak and damaged heart, and was unrelated to BCG vaccination. Ma Liangui's appeal is not valid, and has therefore been rejected.

Ma Shunhua was eight years old and studied at the Liuli Temple Elementary School Children's Night School in this city. On April 18th, the Municipal Public Health Bureau, in order to protect children's health and prevent the spread of lung disease, sent personnel to the school to administer tuberculin skin tests, which were given to 135 students. Ma Shunhua had a slight fever after the injection. On the 21st, she received a BCG vaccination. After the vaccination, Ma Shunhua again had a slight fever and drank a lot of water, but still managed to go to class in the afternoon. After class, she felt slightly headache and arm pain. At dinner, she ate more than half a pancake and two bowls of sorghum porridge, and then went out to play for a while. She felt a stomach ache when she went to bed at night, and began to vomit and sweat profusely, and died the next morning. Ma Liangui believed that his daughter's death was related to the BCG vaccination and appealed to the Municipal People's Court on April 29th.

After accepting the case, the Municipal People's Court first conducted a detailed examination for external injuries. With the consent of the deceased's parents, Ma Shunhua's body was sent to the Peking University Medical College for pathological autopsy for further understanding and research. The autopsy results proved that Ma Shunhua suffered from chronic endocarditis and acute interstitial pneumonia. On June 2nd, the People's Court also invited medical experts from more than ten units, including the Central Ministry of Health, the Beijing Public Health Bureau, the Red Cross Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the Temple of Heaven Anti-Epidemic Station, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and Peking University Medical College, to hold a symposium. The experts unanimously agreed that: (1) the deceased's physical development and nutrition were normal; (2) 33,000 doses of BCG vaccine had been used without any problems. None of the other students vaccinated at the same time as the deceased suffered any illness; (3) No traces of tuberculin solution could be found at the injection site, and there were no abnormal reactions at the BCG injection site. There were no errors in the injection technique; (4) The deceased's fingernails showed a high degree of congestion, which is a symptom of heart disease; (5) According to the pathological autopsy results, the deceased did not exhibit "shock" (i.e., sudden death due to stimulation), and although there were small calcified lesions in the lungs, there was no allergic reaction. The above five points are sufficient to prove that Ma Shunhua's death was unrelated to the injection of tuberculin and BCG vaccine.

Based on the results of the pathological autopsy by Peking University Hospital and the unanimous consensus of the experts at the symposium, the People's Court believes that Ma Shunhua's death was due to acute interstitial pneumonia and a weak and damaged heart, and there was no causal relationship with the injection of tuberculin and BCG vaccine. Therefore, it is ruled that the plaintiff Ma Liangui's appeal is unfounded and is hereby rejected.

　　市法院驳回马舜华死亡案
    经医学专家等解剖研究判明  马之死亡与接种卡介苗无关
    【京市新闻处讯】市民马连贵申诉其八岁之女马舜华之死与接种卡介苗有关一案，经市人民法院详细检验研究，根据尸体解剖，判明马舜华之死系因急性间质性肺炎和心脏脆弱及损害所致，与接种卡介苗无关，马连贵的申诉不能成立，故已予以驳回。
    马舜华现年八岁，在本市琉璃寺小学儿童夜校读书。市公共卫生局为了保护儿童健康，防止传染肺病，曾于四月十八日派人前往该校注射结核素试验针，当有一百三十五名学生注射。马舜华注射后有些发烧。二十一日又接种了卡介苗，接种后马舜华又有些发烧，喝了很多水，但下午仍支持去上课，下课后略感头痛、胳臂疼，晚饭时吃了大半张饼，两碗高粱米粥，饭后又出去玩了一阵，晚间睡觉时感觉肚子疼，并开始呕吐，出虚汗，次日晨即死去。马连贵认为其女之死与接种卡介苗有关，于四月二十九日向市人民法院申诉。
    市人民法院受理此一案件后，首先进行了详细的检验外伤的工作；并征得死者父母同意，将马舜华尸体送北京大学医学院作病理解剖，作进一步的了解和研究。经解剖结果，证明马舜华患有慢性心内膜炎及急性间质性肺炎。六月二日人民法院又邀集了中央卫生部、京公共卫生局、红十字会医院、协和医院、天坛防疫处、防痨协会、北大医学院等十余单位派的医学专家开座谈会。专家们一致认为（一）死者体格发育营养中常；（二）卡介苗已使用过三万三千支，从未发生过问题。此次与死者同时注射的其他学生，均未发生疾患。（三）结核菌素液在注射部位找不出痕迹，卡介苗注射处也无异常反应，在注射技术上并无错误；（四）死者手指甲有高度郁血，是属于心脏病现象；（五）根据病理解剖结果，死者并无“休克”现象（即因受刺激而猝亡），肺中虽有小的钙化病灶，但无过敏反应的现象。以上五点，足证马舜华的死亡与注射结核素卡介苗无关。
    人民法院根据北大医院病理解剖的结果和座谈会专家们的一致认识，认为马舜华之死亡，是由于急性间质性肺炎和心脏脆弱及损害所致，与注射结核素卡介苗毫无因果关系，故特裁定告诉人马连贵之申诉不成立，予以驳回。
