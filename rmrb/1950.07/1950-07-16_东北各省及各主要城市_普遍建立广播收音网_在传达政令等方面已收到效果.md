Radio Broadcasting Networks Universally Established in Northeastern Provinces and Major Cities; Effective in Disseminating Government Orders

[This newspaper dispatch] In five of the six northeastern provinces, the work of establishing radio broadcasting networks has been extensively launched and has achieved some success.

Since the Central People's Government News Administration issued the "Decision on Establishing Radio Broadcasting Networks," the Northeast Region convened the Second Radio Conference in May. "Establishing Radio Broadcasting Networks" became an important item on the agenda of the conference, and the "Regulations for Radio Announcers in the Northeast Region" were formulated as a reference for provincial and municipal stations. The specific network construction plan of "self-organization by each station, under the leadership of the Northeast Region Station" was determined. In June, the Cultural Department of the Northeast People's Government also issued instructions on the establishment of radio broadcasting networks in the Northeast Region. From late May to mid-June, the People's Governments of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaodong, and Liaoxi provinces successively issued circulars or instructions on the establishment of radio networks within their respective provinces. The circulars instructed counties, cities, and organizations, groups, factories, schools, and larger enterprises under their jurisdiction to appoint dedicated radio announcers to carry out listening activities. At the same time, the People's Broadcasting Stations of Northeast China, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, Jilin, Andong, and Jinzhou also successively issued regulations for radio announcers and began recruiting announcers.

At present, the People's Broadcasting Stations of various provinces and cities in Northeast China have achieved preliminary results in establishing radio broadcasting networks.

The Songjiang Provincial Station, Harbin People's Station, drew seven editors and technical staff in mid-June, divided them into four groups, and dispatched them to counties, cities, and important mining areas under the province to specifically assist in establishing radio broadcasting networks. According to materials from early July, fifteen counties, two cities, and one mining area in Songjiang Province have established radio broadcasting organizations, including one hundred and forty government units and two hundred radio announcers. In organizing listening in Harbin, 11,000 listeners have been organized, including 3,000 people listening to "Cadre Study Lectures," 5,900 people listening to "Children's Time," and the rest listening to programs such as "Workers" and "Russian Language Lessons." At the Heilongjiang Provincial Station, Qiqihar People's Station, as of June 24, 170 people had registered and were willing to be radio announcers for the station. In addition, the Changchun People's Broadcasting Station, in order to enable radio announcers to clarify their tasks, rights, and better master radio technology, convened a training meeting for radio announcers from various units. According to statistics, the station has now established listening organizations in 99 units, including government agencies, military units, factories, enterprises, groups, and large and medium-sized schools, with a total of 169 radio announcers.

Although the work of the radio broadcasting network in the Northeast Region is still in its initial stage, the areas where it has been established have already achieved results in various aspects, such as disseminating news, conveying government orders, timely instructing work in various regions, exchanging work experience, and educating and improving the masses. For example, when Jinzhou City held a People's Representative Conference, it broadcast the live proceedings and organized representatives from all walks of life to convey the resolutions and spirit of the People's Representative Conference to the people through the radio. The villagers happily said, "We can hear the mayor's speech while sitting at home." When listening to representatives from all walks of life giving opinions to the government, the villagers reflected, "The government is really democratic now. In the past, who would dare to give opinions to government officials!" Night school students in Jinzhou heard the call to launch a signature campaign to defend peace on the radio, and 5,000 people immediately signed their names after listening to the broadcast. After the Jinzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education broadcast the article "Implement Democratic Management, Oppose Corporal Punishment," more than 400 teachers in Jinzhou organized listening, and some ran to the radio station to copy the draft for study. Many teachers reflected on their own thoughts and conducted self-reflection.

　　东北各省及各主要城市
    普遍建立广播收音网
    在传达政令等方面已收到效果
    【本报讯】东北六个省中的五个省份现已广泛地展开了建立广播收音网的工作，并且已获得了一些成绩。
    自中央人民政府新闻总署发布了《关于建立广播收音网的决定》以后，东北区在五月间召开了第二届广播会议，《建立收音网》成为该会讨论的重要议程，并且制订出东北区台收音员条例以作为各省、市台的参考，确定了“由各台自行组织、经东北区台领导”的具体建网计划。六月间，东北人民政府文化部也发布了关于东北区建立广播收音网的指示。从五月下旬到六月中旬，先后又有吉林、黑龙江、松江、辽东和辽西等五个省的人民政府接连发出关于建立省内收音网的通令或指示，通令各该省所属各县、市，和各级机关、团体、工厂、学校、以及较大企业等单位，应该指定专人担任广播收音员，以开展收听工作。与此同时，东北、沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、吉林、安东和锦州等人民广播电台也先后发布了收音员条例，开始征求收音员。
    现在东北各省、市人民广播电台在建立收音网工作方面，已经得到了初步的成绩。
    松江省省台哈尔滨人民台，六月中抽调编辑、机务干部等七人，分成四组分赴该省所属各县、市以及重要矿区具体协助建立广播收音网工作。根据七月初的材料，松江省已经有十五个县、两个市、一个矿区建立了广播收音组织，其中包括一百四十个机关单位，二百名收音员。在哈尔滨市组织收听方面，已经组织了一万一千名听众。其中收听“干部学习讲座”的三千人；收听“儿童时间”的五千九百人；其余是收听“职工”、“俄语讲授”等节目的。在黑龙江省省台齐齐哈尔人民台，截至六月二十四号的统计，也已经有一百七十人进行了登记、愿意做该台的广播收音员。此外，长春市人民广播电台为了使收音员能明确自己的任务、权利和比较能掌握收音机技术，曾召集了各单位的收音员开讲习会。据统计，现在该台在机关、部队、工厂、企业、团体和大、中、小学校，已经建立起来收听组织的，有九十九个单位共一百六十九名收音员。
    东北区的广播收音网工作虽然还在初创阶段，但是一经建立的地区，对于发布新闻、传达政令、及时指示各地工作、交流工作经验，以及教育和提高群众等各方面，已经收到效果。例如锦州市召开人民代表会议时，曾经转播了会场实况，并且组织各界代表通过电台、向人民群众传达人民代表会议的决议和精神，老乡们高兴地说：“坐在家里就能听到市长讲话”。听各界代表给政府提意见时，老乡反映说：“现在政府真是民主了，过去，谁敢给政府人员提意见！”锦州夜校学员，从广播里听到保卫和平展开签名的号召，有五千人刚听完了广播就立刻签了名。锦州市文教局广播《实行民主管理，反对体罚制度》一稿后，锦市四百多教师组织收听，有的跑到电台抄稿，进行学习。许多教员联系自己思想，进行反省。
