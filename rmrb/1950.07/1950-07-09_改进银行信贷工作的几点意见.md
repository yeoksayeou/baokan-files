　　Several Suggestions for Improving Bank Credit Work
　　Northeast Bank Credit Department Director Wang Jiyuan

　　(1) Make the Bank the Center for "Settlement, Credit, and Cash"
　　Since the Northeast Bank implemented the new "settlement, credit, and cash" center in January of this year, there has been a significant increase in the amount of credit compared to last year. The increase in loans to state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises is particularly large. Other loans, such as those to state-owned forestry, salt industry, and local industries, have also seen substantial increases. In this way, the bank has taken on the task of a credit center, solving the difficulties in capital turnover for various enterprise departments, and changing the previous supply system of funds for each unit to a credit system, thereby promoting economic accounting and powerfully cooperating with production. Without the settlement system between state-owned enterprises and without universal and thorough cash management, bank deposits could not have grown rapidly and substantially, and there would have been no power to handle such large-scale lending.

　　(2) Several Problems Requiring Urgent Solutions
　　However, there are still several relatively serious problems in the current credit to state-owned enterprises that urgently need to be solved.

　　The first problem is that some staff members of certain enterprise departments have a biased understanding of credit. When the bank began to implement the new business at the beginning of this year, many comrades, accustomed to the supply system, regarded bank loans as funds that should be allocated to them by the higher authorities, only paid by the bank. Some believe that the bank should unconditionally advance or borrow the balance of income and expenditure; and some bank cadres also mistakenly pay the balance of the income and expenditure plan unconditionally, without going through credit procedures, credit contracts, or stipulating repayment dates, forming "free-flowing credit." After this idea was overcome in March, another bias arose in some enterprise units, that is, only relying on credit, without relying on the idea of accelerating the internal capital turnover of the enterprise. Many units have accumulated a large number of finished products (commodities), semi-finished products, and a considerable amount of stagnant materials. Instead of actively trying to deal with them and accelerating the turnover of funds, they even borrow from the bank to pay profits, depreciation, taxes, etc., thinking that the bank must lend all the funds they need, otherwise, "production will be affected, and the bank should be responsible." This idea not only hinders the correct conduct of credit work, but also greatly hinders the internal acceleration of capital turnover of enterprises.

　　The second problem is the relatively common phenomenon of accumulation in the use of credit funds. The bank's credit has indeed solved the difficulty of insufficient capital turnover in the production of public enterprises, solved the seasonal and other legitimate turnover of products and commodities, and solved the difficulty of funds for the legitimate storage of raw materials, which is the main aspect. However, from the perspective of credit use, it reflects that many units have improper and unnecessary accumulation of funds, which also causes credit funds to be accumulated and unable to play a greater role.

　　This accumulation is generally caused by three reasons.

　　(1) Low quality or high cost of finished products leads to accumulation. For example, the dyestuff factory produced 160 tons of sulfurized blue in April this year, and delivered 40 tons to the department store. Due to the high cost and the selling price being nearly double the market price (also partly due to seasonal reasons), it was not sold out, and the remaining 120 tons accumulated, totaling more than 30 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Another example is the wool fabric of the woolen mill and the soap of the chemical plant, all of which cannot be sold due to high prices. Therefore, the credit of these units cannot be repaid immediately, or there is no certainty or confidence in repaying the credit.

　　(2) Production or commodity procurement is not combined with market needs, resulting in accumulation. For example, the procurement of certain local products by the native product company cannot be sold after acquisition due to inaccurate estimates of market needs, and they are unable to pay off the overdue debts. In the previous period, the water pumps and rock drills produced by the Machinery Bureau were also largely unsalable due to a lack of understanding of market needs, which made the Machinery Bureau's own funds accumulate and unable to be used, and they had to borrow from the bank every month. This is because some production units have failed to be directly responsible for promotion. The factory's products are handed over to the bureau or department for unified promotion, instead of directly signing contracts with the buying units under the intention, plan, and assistance of the bureau and department. Therefore, the factory does not care much or cannot care about the quality, specifications, cost, and sales of the products. Some factory leaders believe that as long as the production plan is completed, the task is completed. As for not being able to sell it, the bureau should be responsible, and the bureau believes that the department should be responsible. This disconnects production from promotion.

　　(3) Some units have stored too many unnecessary stagnant materials, which may be urgently needed materials in another factory. If stagnant materials cannot be processed quickly, on the one hand, factories lacking materials require bank credit to purchase on the market; on the other hand, factories accumulating stagnant materials are equivalent to accumulating funds.

　　The third problem is that the credit plan is poor and there is still a large degree of blindness. This unplanned situation arises from two aspects: on the bank's side, because there is no experience after the implementation of the new work, and no specific research has been done on the business and financial status of the loan units, there is no certainty about the credit plan. For example, the actual loan figure at the end of the first quarter exceeded the original planned figure by 2.3 times, which proves that the bank's estimate of the new situation was insufficient, thus bankrupting the original plan. On the other hand, various enterprise departments also showed a very poor sense of planning for credit. Many units cannot repay loans on time and postpone them again and again; many units cannot propose a loan repayment period, and some still cannot propose a definite repayment date after repeated postponements. Many units often fail to submit a plan in advance and go through the formalities after negotiating an overdraft limit with the bank, and temporarily require transfers exceeding the overdraft limit, and most of them are for urgent use, so that failure to solve them affects work, and solving them destroys the credit plan. In four months, the number of such temporary credit requests is very large, and some have changed their plans three times in a month. This makes it more difficult for the bank to formulate a comprehensive credit plan. There are also some units that borrow money without using it due to inaccurate plans or other reasons. For example, in April, the textile bureau handled credit on behalf of various factories, totaling more than 1.5 trillion, but by the end of the month, only the dyeing and finishing factory used 88.6 billion; the rest was mostly unused. Most of the 540 billion credit handled by the coal mine bureau on behalf of the seven mines was also unused.

　　These situations have damaged the accuracy of the credit plan and have a great impact on currency withdrawal, currency circulation, capital turnover, and market prices, which must be effectively improved.

　　(3) Several Basic Keys to Doing a Good Job in Credit Work
　　The solution to the above problems depends on the joint efforts of various enterprise departments and banks.

　　First, all methods should be used to accelerate the capital turnover of enterprise departments, liberate accumulated funds, and implement the economic accounting system. This is the basic key to the problem. The basic way to solve this problem is to thoroughly implement the independent accounting system in each enterprise unit and each factory and mine, determine capital, and operate independently. Enterprise units should bear full or maximum responsibility for raw material procurement and finished product sales under the intention and plan of the superior. In this way, production units will definitely be concerned about the price, quality, and storage volume of raw materials, especially the quality and sales of finished products, that is, they will inevitably be concerned about the speed of capital turnover.

　　Second, the bank should implement conditional credit. The Northeast People's Government's order on January 10 regarding the implementation of the independent accounting system and the establishment of a new settlement system has long stipulated that "the bank should examine its production plan, financial status, creditworthiness, and loan purpose, etc., to decide whether to grant short-term turnover, but it must be handled in accordance with the regulations and repaid on time." However, in the first four months of this year's implementation, because of simply emphasizing "not affecting production," the above regulations were not fully followed, so some enterprise units were either responsive to requests without any investigation, or although they knew that the loan unit had accumulated funds, they continued to lend in order to maintain production, and even increased new loans without the approval of the head office. In this way, they cannot be actively promoted to liberate accumulated funds by promoting finished products, improving quality, and reducing costs. Therefore, the bank's credit work for public enterprises must be loaned under certain quantity, certain purpose, certain time of repayment, and certain guarantee conditions. For enterprises with excessive accumulation of certain products, excessive accumulation of unnecessary stagnant materials, and thus accumulation of funds, and those that are in arrears with bank loans, in principle, all methods should be adopted to urge them to liberate accumulated funds to solve their production turnover, and no further loans should be given.

　　A related issue is to oppose arrears. The current widespread and unlimited rollover of state-owned enterprises should be restricted, and overdue interest should be charged. For some serious arrears, lending for a certain period can be stopped, and old loans can be recovered; for long-term arrears that are not repaid, the government can be reported for handling in accordance with the regulations.

　　Finally, the planning of credit work must be strengthened. Each enterprise unit should submit a credit plan to the bank on a quarterly and monthly basis, and submit the documents related to the credit plan (such as income and expenditure plan, production or business plan, raw material procurement and finished product sales plan, etc.) to the bank so that the bank has a basis to review these plans and prepare a comprehensive credit plan based on these plans. At the same time, these plans are required to be as accurate as possible to reduce temporary credit. On the bank's side, it should specifically study the credit changes of each enterprise unit based on past experience and the characteristics, seasonality, and other conditions of each enterprise, so that it can make a preliminary plan before the plans of each unit are sent, and then revise it according to the plans of each unit to make a more accurate official plan. And it needs to be continuously improved in actual work.

　　改进银行信贷工作的几点意见
    东北银行信贷处长  王纪元
    （一）使银行成为“结算、信贷、现金”的中心
    东北银行自今年一月执行新的“结算、信贷、现金”中心以来，在信贷数目上，与去年相比较有了巨大的增长。而其中对国营工商业的放款，增长尤巨。其他如国营林业、盐业、地方工业等放款也都有巨额增长。这样，银行就担负起了信贷中心的任务，解决了各企业部门资金周转上的困难，改变了过去各单位资金的供给制为信贷制，因而促进了经济核算，有力地配合了生产。如果没有国营企业之间的结算制度，没有普遍彻底的现金管理，银行存款也就不能迅速、大量地增长，就没有力量举办这样大规模的放款。
   （二）几个急须解决的问题
    但是，在目前对国营企业信贷中，还存在几个比较严重的问题，急需解决。
    第一个问题，是某些企业部门的工作人员对于信贷的认识上有偏差。今年初银行开始执行新业务时，不少同志因为习惯了供给制，因而把银行贷款看作是上级应该调拨给他的资金，不过由银行支付罢了。有的就认为收支差额，银行也应该无条件垫款或借款；而银行也有一些干部，误把收支计划差额无条件支付，不办信贷手续、信贷契约、不规定偿还日期，形成“自流式信贷”。这种思想在三月份克服下去后，某些企业单位中又产生了另外一种偏向，即只依靠信贷，而不依靠加速企业内部资金周转的想法。很多单位积压着大量的成品（商品）、半成品及相当多的呆滞材料，不积极设法处理，使资金加速其周转，反而连上交利润、折旧、税收等，都要到银行借款，认为他所需的一切资金，银行都必需借给，否则，“影响生产，银行应该负责”。这种思想，不仅妨碍信贷工作之正确进行，而且对于企业内部加速资金周转也有很大的阻碍。
    第二个问题，是在信贷资金运用中存在着比较普遍的积压现象。银行的信贷固然解决了公营企业生产中资金周转不足的困难，解决了产品、商品的季节性及其他正当周转，解决了原材料正当储存等资金困难，这是主要的一方面。但是，从信贷用途上看，反映出不少单位有不正当的、不必要的积压资金现象，因而使信贷资金也受到积压，不能起更大的作用。
    这种积压大体上是由三种原因造成的。
    （一）成品质量低或成本高形成了积压。如染料厂之硫化青，今年四月共产一六○吨，交给百货公司四○吨。因成本高，售价高于市价近一倍（也有部分的季节性原因），致未全部卖出，余下一二○吨，共积压资金三○○余亿元（东北币，下同）。又如毛织厂之毛呢，化工厂之肥皂，全是由于价高不能出售。因而这些单位的信贷，就不能即时归还，或者对归还信贷无把握，无信心。
    （二）生产或商品采购未与市场需要相结合，因而形成了积压。如土产公司之某些土产采购，因对市场需要估计不确，在收购之后不能卖出，也就无力还清到期的欠款。前一时期机械局所生产的水泵，凿岩机，也因对市场需要不了解而大部不能销出，使机械局自己的资金积压不能运用，每月都要向银行借贷。这是由于某些生产单位未能对推销直接负责，厂里的产品交局或交部统一推销，而不是在局、部的意图、计划、协助之下，自己负责与买货单位直接订立合同，因而工厂对产品之质量、规格、成本、销路是不大关心或无法关心的。某些工厂的负责人，认为只要按照生产计划完成，就算完成了任务，至于卖不出，则应该由局负责，局则认为应该由部负责。这样便使生产与推销脱节。
    （三）某些单位存储了过多的不必要的呆滞材料，在另一个工厂也许就是急需的材料。如果呆滞材料不能迅速处理，一方面缺材料的工厂要求银行信贷在市场收买；另一方面积压呆滞材料的工厂却等于积压了资金。
    第三个问题，是信贷计划性差，还存在较大的盲目性。这种无计划的情况是从两方面产生的：在银行方面，因为新工作实行后，没有经验，没有对贷款单位的业务状况与财务状况加以具体的研究，因而对信贷计划就没有把握。如第一季度末实际放款数字超过原计划数字二·三倍，就证明银行对新情况估计不足，因而使原计划破产。另一方面，各企业部门也同样表现了对信贷的计划性很差。很多单位借款不能如期归还，一再延期；不少单位不能提出贷款偿还期限，有的则在一再延期后仍然不能提出确切的归还日期。不少单位在与银行商订透支限度之后，往往事先未提出计划，不办理手续，临时要求超过透支限度的转账，且大都是急用，以致不解决时影响工作，解决就破坏了信贷计划。四个月中，这种临时信贷要求数字是很大的，有的在一个月中连续变更三次计划。这样就给银行制做综合信贷计划以更大的困难。还有一些单位，因为计划不准确或其他原因，借了款不用。如四月份纺织局代各厂办理之信贷，共计一万五千余亿，但到月底为止，只染整厂动用八百八十六亿；其余，绝大部分皆未动用。煤矿局代七个矿所办之五千四百余亿信贷，其中也大部分未动用。
    这些情况，都损害了信贷计划的准确性，对货币回笼、货币流通、资金周转、市场物价都有很大的影响，是必须切实加以改进的。
    （三）做好信贷工作的几个基本关键
    上述问题之解决，有赖于各企业部门及银行之共同努力。
    第一、应该用一切办法加速企业部门的资金周转，解放被积压资金，贯彻经济核算制，这是问题的基本关键。解决此一问题的基本办法，是在各企业单位、各厂矿彻底执行独立会计制，确定资金，独立经营。企业单位的原料采购，成品销售，应该在上级意图、计划之下负全部或最大的责任。这样，生产单位就一定会关心到原料的价格、质量、储存量，特别是关心到成品的质量及销路问题，也就是必然关心到资金周转的速度问题。
    第二、银行方面应该实行有条件的信贷。东北人民政府一月十日关于实行独立会计制度及建立新的结算制度的命令早已规定“银行则考查其生产计划，财务状况，信用程度及贷款用途等决定予以短期周转，但必须是按章办理，到期归还。”但在今年执行的最初四个月当中，因为单纯强调“不影响生产”，并没有完全按上述规定办事，因而对某些企业单位，或者是有求必应，毫不考察，或者是虽然知道贷款单位资金积压，但为了使他维持生产，因而照旧贷放，甚而不经总行批准，即增加新贷。这样，便不能以积极态度，促进他们用推销成品、提高质量、减低成本等办法，把积压资金解放出来。因而，银行对公营企业的信贷工作，必须是在一定数量、一定用途、一定时间归还和一定保证条件下贷放。对某些产品积压过多，不必要的呆滞材料积压过多，因而积压了资金，并对银行拖欠贷款的企业，原则上应采用一切办法督促他解放积压的资金来解决他生产上的周转，不应继续再给以贷款。
    与此相联系的一个问题，就是反对拖欠。对目前国营企业中普遍的、无限制的转期应加以限制，且须加收过期利息。对某些严重的拖欠，可以实行停止一定时期的贷放，收回旧贷；对长期拖欠不还的，可报告政府按章处理。
    最后，必须加强信贷工作的计划性。各企业单位应按季、按月向银行提交信贷计划，并将与信贷计划有关的书类（如收支计划、生产或业务计划、原料采购及成品推销计划等）一同送交银行，以便银行有根据来审核这些计划，并根据这些计划来编制综合的信贷计划。同时，要求这些计划尽量准确，减少临时信贷。在银行方面，则应该根据以往的经验及每个企业的特点、季节性等条件，具体地研究各企业单位信贷变动的情况，以便在各单位计划未送到之前，就能够做一个初步的计划，然后根据各单位计划加以修正，做成比较准确的正式计划。并需要在实际工作中不断地努力改进。
