　　Planting of crops completed in western Ningxia
　　The sowing work of summer fields in Ningxia Province was all completed in early April. Currently, most areas have been irrigated for the first time, and farmers in various places are launching enthusiastic weeding campaigns. Women have also generally participated in the cooperative weeding work. According to preliminary statistics, this year the province has sown a total of 838,036 mu of summer fields, of which the wheat sown area accounts for 714,178 mu, an increase of 66,231 mu compared to last year.

　　Factories in Jilin City strengthen security work
　　In early April, the Jilin City Labor Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, and trade union and other organs organized four inspection teams to focus on inspecting the safety and health work of factories in the city, which has attracted the attention of the administrative leaders and workers of various factories. The factories have successively established special responsibility systems and shift handover systems for mechanical maintenance, use, and storage, and improved fire prevention, anti-espionage, and anti-theft systems.

　　Safety and health work in state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province urgently needs improvement
　　The Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized a "Work Safety and Health Inspection Group" to inspect the safety and health work of the state-owned Yangquan No. 4 Mine, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Match Factory, and the provincial Jin Sheng Textile Factory, and found that worker casualties are still very serious. The ratio of coal production to casualties in the state-owned Yangquan No. 4 Mine from January to April was, on average, one injury for every 450 tons of coal produced, and one death for every 40,000 tons produced. At the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the number of workers who died or became disabled within a year accounted for 0.62% of the total number of workers. The direct causes of the casualties were mostly avoidable accidents for which someone was responsible. The sanitary facilities of each factory are also extremely inadequate. In April, the average number of people unable to participate in production due to illness at the Iron and Steel Plant accounted for 1% of the total number of workers; at the Match Factory, the number of sick people exceeded half of the workers. Since the inspection group's inspection, some factories have begun to improve their work.

　　山西国营厂矿安卫工作亟待改进
    山西省人民政府及省工会联合组织“工矿安全卫生检查团”，检查了国营阳泉第四矿、太原钢铁厂、火柴厂和省营晋生纺织厂的安全卫生工作，发现工人伤亡现象仍很严重。国营阳泉第四矿一至四月产煤量与伤亡比率是，平均每产煤四百五十吨伤一人，每产四万吨死一人。太原钢铁厂一年内死亡残废的占工人总数百分之○·六二。伤亡的直接原因，大都是属于可以避免的责任事故。各厂卫生设备亦极不完善，四月份钢铁厂平均每天因病不能参加生产者，占工人总数百分之一；火柴厂患病者超过工人半数。自检查团检查后，有的厂已着手改进工作。
