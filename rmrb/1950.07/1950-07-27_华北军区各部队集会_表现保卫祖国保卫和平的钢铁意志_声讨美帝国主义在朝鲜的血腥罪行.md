　　Gatherings of Various Units of the North China Military Region
    Express Steel Will to Defend the Motherland and Peace
    Denounce the Bloody Crimes of US Imperialism in Korea
    [Reported by this newspaper] The armed forces of the North China Military Region have expressed extraordinary anger at the US imperialists' direct aggression against Korea and their aid to the Kuomintang remnants to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. Over the past month, various units have successively held various gatherings to denounce the towering crimes of the US imperialists against the Korean people. All units have unanimously and resolutely expressed to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government their indestructible steel will to defend the homeland and liberate Taiwan, and have extended sincere sympathy and support to the just war being waged by the Korean people. The head of a certain army corps responsible for coastal defense confidently stated at the outset, "The Chinese people and their People's Liberation Army have been tempered in the fierce flames of war. If the US imperialists dare to invade Taiwan, they will certainly be expelled from our country's territory. We, guarding the coastal defense line of our motherland, are ready at any time to strike hard at any aggressors who dare to offend us, to defend our motherland and defend world peace." All commanders and fighters of the Inner Mongolia Military Region telegraphed the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, resolutely stating that they would "stand together with the Chinese people and all fraternal units throughout the country to fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the US aggressors."

    US Aggression Enrages Soldiers, Intensifies Participation in Peace Signature Campaign
    The barbaric act of aggression by US imperialism has fueled the intensely ongoing peace signature campaign within the units. The total number of signatures in a certain army reached over 90% of the army's total strength. Cooks and fodder raisers participated in the signing, and even wounded and sick soldiers got out of bed to sign. Liu Zhengming, a recuperating cadre at the military region's cadre sanatorium who had participated in the revolution for 22 years and lost his right arm in the war, wrote on the signature book: "If the warmongers dare to launch a war, I will continue to fight for the peace cause of the people of the world with my only left hand." Chen Chu, another convalescent who lost his sight in the war, personally signed without asking anyone to write for him and wrote the eight characters: "Crush the conspiracy of aggressive war."

    Concern for the Victory of the Korean People Like Family
    The victory of the Korean People's Army has given the greatest encouragement to the broad masses of commanders and fighters in our units. They have shown deep concern for the Korean people's war of liberation. Soldiers scramble to read newspaper reports about the victories of the Korean People's Army every day and automatically gather together to discuss them. Many commanders and fighters in the tank units can remember in detail where the Korean People's Army fought on a certain day and how many enemies were annihilated in a certain battle. Li Yonglu, a soldier in the first detachment of the provost brigade, who used to dislike reading newspapers or listening to news reports, has recently become one of the most active readers, saying, "The victory of the Korean people is our victory, like one family. How can we not care?" The loudspeaker and blackboard bulletins of the artillery units broadcast news of the Korean People's Army's victory every day. A map of South Korea was newly added to the club, and the small red flags moved south every day. Whenever the soldiers talked about it, they always said, "This time, the paper tiger of US imperialism has been punctured."

    Seeing Through the American Paper Tiger Enhances Confidence in Liberating Taiwan
    The appearance of the paper tiger of US imperialism is becoming clearer and clearer to us, further enhancing the commanders' and fighters' confidence that "it can be completely defeated." When soldiers talk about the combat effectiveness of the US military, they always add mocking words. Tas Shao Bu, a soldier in the Inner Mongolia cavalry unit, compared the US imperialists to a wild beast that still opens its mouth to bite before dying. The soldiers of the provost brigade spit as they described the embarrassing retreat of the US military on the Korean battlefield. Hou Zhonglin, a provost in the first squad, said: "The US military went to deliver American equipment to the Korean People's Army, just like in our Chinese Liberation War in the past. Now, Syngman Rhee has taken over from Chiang Kai-shek as the chief transportation captain." Jiao Fang, the squad leader of the sixth squad, said: "The US imperialists got a beating in Korea, and if they want to stop us from attacking Taiwan, we will also prepare a hard beating for them. We drove them out of mainland China during the Liberation War, and today we have even more strength to drive them out of Taiwan. We have the experience of crossing the sea to fight on Hainan Island, and liberating Taiwan is a sure thing."

    Salute the Korean People's Army Brothers, Learn Combat Techniques from Them
    Various units excitedly wrote letters to the Korean People's Army brothers, saluting their bravery and expressing condolences for their arduous battles. The air force units wrote to the Korean People's Army Air Force, expressing: "We are fully prepared and must liberate Taiwan, just as you must liberate Korea." The US imperialist aggression against Taiwan and the heroic victory of the Korean People's Army in striking the US military have made the soldiers more aware of the importance of studying culture and mastering modern technology. Qiu Runchuan, a special combat hero of the artillery unit, said: "The Korean People's Army fought so bravely, I must work hard to improve my culture and master modern technology so that I can send the invaders back to their hometown." Shen Pei, a soldier in the tank unit, said: "Only by improving culture can we improve military technology. I must study hard and, like the tank units of the Korean People's Army, defeat the tank units of the US aggressor army." Standing at their posts to consolidate national defense and not allowing the invaders to invade an inch of our land has become a common call. Bai Mengjiu, the squad leader of the fourth squad of the provost brigade, said: "If the front-line troops are fighting in Taiwan, we must eliminate enemy agents in the rear so that the front-line troops can let go and fight in Taiwan, and jointly strive to complete the task of liberating the country smoothly as soon as possible."

　　华北军区各部队集会
    表现保卫祖国保卫和平的钢铁意志       
    声讨美帝国主义在朝鲜的血腥罪行
    【本报讯】华北军区各武装部队对于美帝国主义者直接侵略朝鲜与援助国民党残匪阻挠中国人民解放台湾的罪恶行为，表示异常愤怒。一个月来，各部队都陆续举行各种集会，声讨美帝国主义者对于朝鲜人民的滔天罪行，各部队均一致向毛主席、向中央人民政府坚决表示捍卫国土解放台湾的不可摧毁的钢铁意志，并对朝鲜人民进行的正义战争，寄予真挚的同情和声援。担任海防任务的某兵团首长，最初就满怀自信地发表言论说：“中国人民和他的解放军是在残酷的战争烈火中锻炼出来的。美帝国主义者胆敢侵略台湾，必把他们从我们祖国的领土上驱逐出去。我们守卫在祖国的海防线上，随时准备痛击任何敢于冒犯我们的侵略者，保卫我们的祖国，保卫全世界的和平。”内蒙军区部队全体指战员，打电报给中央人民政府毛主席，坚决表示要“和中国人民及全国兄弟部队在一起，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底”。
    美国侵略激怒了战士们热烈参加和平签名运动
    美帝这个野蛮的侵略行为，推动了部队中正在热烈进行的和平签名运动。某军签名总人数达全军人数百分之九十以上。炊事员、饲券员参加签名，养伤害病的战士们也从病床上爬起来签名，军区干部疗养院一个参加了革命二十二年，被战争夺去了右臂的休养员刘正明，在签名书上写道：“如果战争贩子们敢发动战争，我将以仅有的一只左手，继续为世界人民的和平事业战斗到底。”另一个在战争中双目失明的休养员陈础，不叫旁人代笔，亲自签名，并写：“粉碎侵略战争阴谋”八个大字。
    对朝鲜人民的胜利象一家人一样关心
    朝鲜人民军的胜利，给了我们部队广大指战员以最大的鼓舞。他们对朝鲜人民的解放战争表现了深切的关心，战士们每天争抢着阅读报纸上关于朝鲜人民军胜利的消息，自动的集在一起座谈。战车部队好多指战员，都能够详细记住朝鲜人民军某天打到某地方，在某次战斗中歼敌多少。纠察总队一大队战士李永禄，过去不爱看报也不愿听读报，近来变成最积极读报的一个人，他说：“朝鲜人民的胜利就是我们的胜利，象一家人一样。怎能不关心？”炮兵部队的广播筒、黑板报每天登着朝鲜人民军胜利的新闻，俱乐部新添上南朝鲜的地图，小红旗每天都向南移动。战士们每谈论起来，总是说：“美帝国主义这只纸老虎，这回可被戳破了。”
    看透了美国纸老虎增强解放台湾信心
    美帝国主义者纸老虎的相貌，愈来愈清楚的暴露在我们的面前，更加增强了指战员“完全可以打败他”的信心。战士们谈论美军的战斗力时，总要加上嘲笑的言词。内蒙骑兵部队战士塔斯少卜把美帝比做一个临死前还要张着嘴咬人的野兽。纠察总队的战士们吐着唾沫描述美军在朝鲜战场上的狼狈溃逃的情景，一中队纠察员侯忠林说：“美军是给朝鲜人民军送美式装备去了，就象过去在我们中国解放战争中一样，现在李承晚又接着蒋介石当上运输大队长了。”六中队班长焦方说：“美帝国主义者在朝鲜挨了一棒子，他想阻挡我们打台湾，我们同样给他准备下狠狠一棒子，我们在解放战争中把他们赶出中国大陆，今天更有力量把他们赶出台湾，我们有海南岛渡海作战的经验，解放台湾是十拿九稳。”
    向朝鲜人民军弟兄致敬向他们学习战斗的技术
    各个部队兴奋地给朝鲜人民军弟兄们写信，向他们的勇敢致敬，向他们的艰苦战斗致慰问，空军部队写信给朝鲜人民军空军，表示：“我们有充分准备，一定要解放台湾，正如你们一定要解放朝鲜一样。”美帝侵略台湾和朝鲜人民军英勇打击美军的胜利，使战士们更加认识到学习文化掌握现代化技术的重要。炮兵部队特等战斗英雄邱润川说：“朝鲜人民军打的真够英勇，我一定要努力提高文化，把现代化技术练得熟熟的，准备送侵略者回老家。”战车部队战士申佩说：“只有提高了文化，才能提高军事技术，我一定好好学习，和朝鲜人民军的坦克部队那样，打垮美国侵略军的坦克部队。”站在自己的岗位上来巩固国防，不叫侵略者侵犯我们一寸国土，已成为普遍的呼声。纠察总队四中队班长白梦九说：“有前方部队打台湾，我们要在后方肃清敌特，使前方部队放手打台湾，共同争取早日顺利的完成解放全国的任务。”
