　　Letter from the Vietnam Children's Art Troupe to Chinese Children

Dear Chinese Children Friends:

　　We recently had the opportunity to meet Vietnamese representatives, aunts who had just returned from Beijing after attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference, and learned a lot about you. We also received many gifts from you. We are very excited and express our sincere gratitude to you!

　　Currently, French colonialists are conducting a savage war of aggression on our homeland, slaughtering our people. The war has forced us to leave our homes, say goodbye to our parents, brothers and sisters, and follow our own troops to persist in the war of resistance. We long for the days of freedom and happiness, like you have already obtained.

　　We believe that the Vietnamese people will surely achieve victory.

　　　　　　　　　Representative of the Vietnam Children's Art Troupe Pei Yusheng

　　越南少年儿童艺术工作团给中国少年儿童的信亲爱的中国少年儿童朋友们：
    我们最近有机会见到刚从北京回来的出席亚洲妇女代表会议的越南代表姑姑们，因而知道了许多关于你们的消息。我们也接到了你们送给我们的许多礼物。我们感到非常兴奋，特向你们表示真诚的感谢！
    现在法国殖民者正在我们祖国的土地上进行野蛮地屠杀我国人民的侵略战争。战争迫使我们离开了家乡，告别了自己的父母兄弟姊妹，跟着我们自己的队伍坚持抗战。我们渴望着得到自由、幸福的日子，像你们已经得到的一样。
    我们相信，越南人民是一定能得到胜利的。
                       越南少年儿童艺术工作团代表  裴玉盛
