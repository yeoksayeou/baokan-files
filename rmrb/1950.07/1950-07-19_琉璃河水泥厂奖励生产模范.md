The workers of the grinding workshop suggested connecting the No. 1 and No. 2 raw material mills and installing a conveying pipe to the cement mill hoist, so that the two mills could produce cement simultaneously. The conference awarded the entire workshop staff 500 jin of millet. Fitter Li Ximin suggested adding a tailstock wheel to the No. 1 cement mill so that the motor and pinion gear would not stop grinding due to vibrations. The conference awarded him 500 jin of millet.

He was awarded 200 jin of millet. Meng Guanghou, head of the power workshop, suggested modifying the circulating water ditch gate, so that the water pool, which originally took forty-eight hours to fill, only took two hours, saving 24,840 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 1,100 meters of 31.2 mm wind and rain wire in three startups, and was awarded 100 jin of millet.
