To the Editor:

    The State-run Chabei Mechanized Reclamation Farm should immediately repay the grain owed to the masses.

    On the fourteenth day of the second lunar month, the State-run Chabei Mechanized Reclamation Farm sent comrades Pang Zhenzhou and Wang Haitao to Zemian Gou Village, District One, Chongli County, to purchase wood. (Because the village suffered severe disasters last year, the higher-level government approved the sale of wood to solve some of the production problems.) After comrades Pang and Wang learned about the situation in the village, they found Village Chief Zhang Dianyi and Branch Secretary Li Dian to discuss and sign a contract for ordering wood. A total of 5,200 purlins were ordered, with a price equivalent to 16 large *shi* of naked oats. There were also 2,500 *jin* of firewood, with each 100 *jin* equivalent to 1.5 *dou* of naked oats (the villagers planned to exchange the naked oats to solve this year's seed problems). The contract also stipulated that the village cadres were responsible for gathering all the wood in the village by the twenty-ninth day of the second lunar month, and the farm would come to the village to transport it themselves. The quality of the naked oats provided by the farm would be the responsibility of the contract signatory from the farm, and they guaranteed not to delay the planting season for the people.

    However, before ten days had passed, the farm sent more than twenty flatbed trucks to the village to haul wood, but they did not deliver the naked oats. At that time, the village cadres refused to let them haul the wood. The people hauling the wood said, "We'll send you the naked oats after we haul the wood back." So the village cadres let them haul the wood away, leaving only 74 purlins unhauled. But after the wood was hauled away, the naked oats never arrived. The people were waiting for these naked oats to plant their land. Village Chief Zhang Dianyi had no choice but to mobilize six ox carts in the village to go to the farm to demand the grain. They went to the farm and talked to the farm manager, but he didn't care; he told them to wait until comrades Wang and Pang returned before discussing it. After the village chief explained the situation clearly to the farm manager, they managed to haul back a portion, but they were still short 5 *shi*, 9 *dou*, and 2 *sheng*. As for the remaining grain, it has not been delivered to this day. As a result, more than 100 *mu* of land belonging to the people has been left barren, and the masses are very dissatisfied. I request that the editor publish this issue in the newspaper to urge the Chabei Mechanized Reclamation Farm to quickly repay the grain owed, in order to solve the production difficulties of the masses in our village.

　　国营察北机垦农场拖欠群众粮食应即偿还编辑同志：
    国营察北机垦农场于阴历二月十四日派庞振周与王海桃两同志到崇礼县一区则面沟村购买木料。（该村因去年灾情严重，经上级政府批准出卖木料来解决一部分生产问题。）庞、王二同志到该村了解情况后，找到村长张殿义及支书李殿商量订购木料的合同。共定下檩子五千二百根，价钱合莜麦十六大石。还有木柴二千五百斤，每百斤合一大斗半莜麦（老百姓计划把这莜麦换来解决今年的种籽问题）。合同并订定：村干部负责在阴历二月二十九日将木料全部集中到村里，由农场自己到村里来拉。农场所交莜麦的好坏，由该农场立合同人负责。并保证不耽误老百姓下种时机。
    但是没等十天，农场就来了二十余辆排子车到村里拉木料。可是并没有将莜麦送来。当时村干部就不叫他们拉木料。拉木料的人说：“等我们把木料拉回去再给你们送莜麦来好了。”于是村干部就让他们将木料拉走了，只剩下檩子七十四根没有拉。但木料拉走后，总不见送莜麦来。老百姓等着这些莜麦来种地。村长张殿义没有办法，就在本村动员了牛车六辆，到农场去要粮。到该场找场长商量，他不管；叫等王、庞二同志回来后再谈。经村长和场长说清道理，才给拉回一部分，还缺五石九斗二升。至于其余粮食则至今尚未拿出来。结果老百姓的地荒了一百多亩，群众非常不满。请编辑同志将这个问题在报上发表，促察北机垦农场迅速将所欠粮食还清，以解决我村群众的生产困难。
