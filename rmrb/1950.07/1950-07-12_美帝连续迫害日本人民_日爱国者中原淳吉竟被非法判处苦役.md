　　U.S. Imperialism Continues to Persecute the Japanese People
    Japanese Patriot Junji Nakahara Illegally Sentenced to Hard Labor
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo] News from Tokyo: After U.S. military courts in Japan recently illegally sentenced more than ten Japanese patriots to long terms of hard labor, they sentenced Junji Nakahara, a member of the Executive Committee of the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, to two years of hard labor and fined him $1,000 on the 7th.
    On June 3, Junji Nakahara read out an open letter from the Preparatory Committee of the National Democratic Nationalities United Front to MacArthur at a mass meeting held in the hall of the Tokyo Red Cross Hospital, and he signed the letter on behalf of the Preparatory Committee. The letter protested against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries for sabotaging the May 30th People's Assembly and demanded the immediate release of the eight patriots who had been arrested for participating in the meeting and were being tried by the U.S. military court. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries falsely accused the letter of "defaming the occupation forces," and illegally arrested Junji Nakahara and several other trade union leaders at midnight on June 5, and handed Junji Nakahara over to the U.S. military court for illegal trial.

　　美帝连续迫害日本人民
    日爱国者中原淳吉竟被非法判处苦役
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：在日本的美国军事法庭于最近连续非法判处日本爱国者十余人长期苦役后，又于七日判处全日金属工人工会执行委员会委员中原淳吉苦役二年，并罚款一千美元。
    中原淳吉曾于六月三日在东京红十字会医院大厅举行的群众大会上，宣读全国民主民族战线筹备委员会致麦克阿瑟的公开信，并由他代表筹委会在信上签名。该信抗议美、日反动派破坏五月三十日的人民大会，并要求立即释放因参加该会而被捕并受美国军事法庭审讯的八名爱国者。美、日反动派诬称该信“诽谤占领军”，于六月五日午夜非法逮捕了中原淳吉及其他工会领袖数人，并将中原淳吉解交美国军事法庭非法审讯。
