　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th—Many state-owned and public factories and mines in Northeast China have completed or exceeded their production tasks for the first half of the year ahead of schedule by several days to a month. These include dozens of units producing copper, lead, iron, paper, yarn, cloth, chemicals, rubber products, and electrical equipment. The Second Factory of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration, which produces hand-cranked generators and train generators, exceeded its production task for the first half of the year by 18.75 percent by the end of May. As of June 28, the Shenyang Smelter's electrolytic copper production had exceeded the half-year plan by 19.59 percent, and its electrolytic lead production had exceeded it by 96.26 percent. The ability of the aforementioned factories and mines to over fulfill their production tasks for the first half of the year is mainly due to the close cooperation of administrative, Communist Party, trade union, and Youth League organizations within each unit, which focused on production and strengthened the unity of workers and technicians; the establishment of a responsibility system; and the overcoming of difficulties in technology and raw material supply. For example, the state-owned Shixian Paper Mill only completed one month's production plan in January and February due to water shortages and low machine efficiency; after implementing workshop management and establishing a production responsibility system in March, production efficiency rapidly improved, and the production plan for the first half of the year was completed ahead of schedule.

　　东北国营公营厂矿数十单位提前完成上半年的生产任务
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北许多国营、公营厂矿已提前数日到一个月完成或超过了上半年的生产任务。其中包括生产铜、铅、铁、纸、纱、布、化学品、橡胶品及电气器材等数十单位。东北电器工业管理局第二工厂手摇发电机与火车用发电机的生产，在五月底即超过了上半年生产任务的百分之十八点七五。沈阳冶炼厂至六月二十八日止，电解铜产量已超过半年计划的百分之十九点五九，电解铅产量超过了百分之九十六点二六。上述各厂矿之能超额完成上半年生产任务，主要是由于各单位内行政、共产党、工会、青年团等组织面向生产，密切配合，加强了工人和技术人员的团结；建立责任制，克服了技术和原材料供应等方面的困难。如国营石岘造纸厂在一、二两月中，因水源缺水，机器效能低，仅完成一个月的生产计划；自三月份实行车间管理，建立了生产责任制后，生产效率即迅速提高，提前完成了上半年的生产计划。
