    Asian People Rise Up and Defeat American Aggressors!
    President Truman's challenging statement on June 27, and the subsequent military actions, are a further manifestation of the expansionist and aggressive policies that American imperialism has consistently adopted since the war, and a serious international event unprecedented since the end of World War II.
    From June 17 to 21, Secretary of State Acheson's special advisor, Dulles, went to Seoul and the "38th Parallel." From June 18 to 23, Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley went to Japan. The day after Johnson and Bradley returned to the United States, at dawn on June 25, the puppet Rhee Syngman's National Defense Forces attacked the "38th Parallel," launching a full-scale civil war. On the same day, the United Nations Security Council, hijacked by the United States, falsely accused the counterattack by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as "aggression" against South Korea, and passed an illegal resolution on the Korean situation. On June 27, US President Truman issued a statement undermining peace in the Far East and threatening world peace, openly declaring armed intervention in the Korean civil war, armed obstruction of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and increased military assistance to the reactionary puppet governments of Vietnam and the Philippines. Simultaneously with Truman's statement, the air and naval forces commanded by MacArthur had already joined the fighting against the Korean People's Army, and the US Seventh Fleet in the Pacific had also invaded Chinese territorial waters to control Taiwan. It is clear that US imperialism orchestrated the Korean civil war and used it as a pretext for further aggression against Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other parts of Southeast Asia.
    Before June 27, US imperialism pretended to "not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," pretended to "respect the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of other member states," pretended to have "no predatory ambitions towards Taiwan or other Chinese territories," and pretended to be a "friend of the Asian people." All these principles, constraints, and promises are contained in international agreements such as the United Nations Charter, the Cairo Declaration, and the Potsdam Proclamation accepted by the US government, and in various statements issued by Truman and Acheson. However, the new act of aggression, marked by Truman's statement on June 27 as a turning point, brutally violated all international agreements and statements, thereby tearing off the mask that US imperialism had always worn. The Chinese people, the Korean people, and all the Asian people can clearly see that before June 27, US imperialism was a liar who was unwilling to fully reveal its true colors, and after June 27, it had to become a vicious robber.
    Why did US imperialism not continue to be a liar, but instead become a robber? This is because US imperialism's so-called "Asian policy" has completely failed, and its rogue tactics of sowing discord and threatening with inducements have exhausted its tricks. The level of awareness of the Eastern people is rapidly increasing, and the revolutionary forces are rapidly growing. This situation has caused confusion and unease within the imperialist camp and the American ruling class, resulting in an increasingly widespread sense of defeatism. All gradual and covert policies of aggression can no longer achieve their imperialist goals. US imperialism, like German and Japanese fascism, is moving towards open and direct armed intervention. Therefore, the new act of aggression launched by Truman does not indicate confidence in the future of US imperialism, but rather a lack of confidence, and does not indicate the strength of US imperialism, but rather its fragility.
    The armed intervention of US imperialism absolutely cannot prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. Taiwan must be liberated, and it will definitely be liberated. The Chinese people have already driven the forces of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique it supports out of mainland China and achieved a historic victory in the revolution. Therefore, the Chinese people have full confidence and experience to drive their enemies out of Taiwan and all territories belonging to China. The armed intervention of US imperialism also absolutely cannot prevent the Korean people from liberating the whole country. In the four days from June 25 to 28, the Korean People's Army has already achieved initial major victories, liberating thirteen major cities, including the capital Seoul, and a vast area of nearly 20,000 square kilometers. The Korean people, who are forced to wage a just revolutionary war, will be even more courageous because of the direct participation of American armed forces in the war, and will continue to give heavy blows to the American intervention army and the Rhee Syngman puppet army. At the same time, the armed intervention of US imperialism will naturally not intimidate the oppressed nations and peoples of the East who are striving for liberation. They will increase their animosity and vigilance because the true face of US imperialism as a robber is exposed.
    The Chinese people have stood up. All the Asian people have awakened. The colonial era of imperialists interfering in Asian affairs is over. The Japanese fascists who launched the "September 18th Incident" and established the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" have been defeated by the Chinese people and all the Asian people. US imperialism, which is carrying out armed intervention in the Korean civil war, interfering in the liberation of Taiwan, interfering in the internal affairs of Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries, will inevitably meet the same fate. History will prove this.
    North Atlantic Aggressive Bloc Encounters New Setbacks
    All indications show that the contradictions within imperialist countries are not shrinking and resolving according to the subjective wishes of the American monopoly capital group, but are expanding and developing according to the dialectical laws of history. The North Atlantic aggressive bloc after the London Conference is encountering increasingly serious difficulties.
    US imperialism's so-called "overall diplomacy," which aims to unify the internal affairs of imperialist countries in order to launch a new war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, reached a new stage during the London Conference in May. Under the direction and manipulation of Acheson, the representatives of the Western vassal states—mainly Britain and France—accepted the American expansion plan to further accelerate war preparations. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, attended by the foreign ministers of twelve countries, decided to immediately form a standing body to direct the overall war preparations of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc—the Foreign Ministers' Assistants' Meeting—with the American "superman," possessing dictatorial powers, as the natural chairman of this standing body. The US-British-French Foreign Ministers' meeting, attended by Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman, decided to occupy West Germany for a long time under the guise of de facto reconciliation and to make West Germany a member of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. During the London Conference, Washington's loyal running dog, French Foreign Minister Schuman, was ordered to propose the so-called Franco-German coal and steel union plan, demanding that Western European countries abandon their "national sovereignty in peacetime" to serve the war policy of US imperialism. The purpose of these decisions and plans is to unify the war potential of Western European countries in a "supranational body" controlled by US imperialism, with West Germany's arms industry and fascist mercenaries as the center and backbone of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Otherwise, it will be impossible for US imperialism to launch a new war of aggression.
    However, US imperialism is by no means unimpeded in accelerating its expansionist policy. On the contrary, it is suffering new setbacks. For example, although it has only been a little over a month, the so-called "cold war cabinet" that warmonger Acheson boasted about has now become a very different technical institution. The representatives dispatched by the United States and Britain, especially the United States, are no longer the "most talented" "supermen," but silent and odorless "dwarfs." Anyone can see that a standing body and representatives like this obviously cannot complete the aggressive tasks assigned to the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. At the same time, the much-publicized Schuman Plan has also proven to be more and more like a fleeting soap bubble. Britain bluntly refused to participate in negotiations on the Schuman Plan. The British Labour Party issued a statement opposing the economic "integration" of Western Europe. At the six-nation conference held in Paris, serious differences of opinion arose among the representatives of various countries, making the negotiations fruitless. Currently, the six-nation conference has been shelved due to the collapse of the Bidault-Schuman cabinet.
    These situations illustrate that in the face of US imperialism's arrogant plan to establish a world hegemony and world empire centered on the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the contradictions and antagonisms within the imperialist camp have developed and become more acute. Because the "superman" or "supranational body" manufactured by Wall Street not only requires all vassal states to abandon all their political, military, and diplomatic sovereignty, but also requires the ruling classes of those countries to give up their own economic interests. This cannot but arouse their resistance. The difficult birth and weakening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's standing body and the near-abortion of the Schuman Plan expose the insurmountable weaknesses inherent in monopoly capitalism itself.

    亚洲人民起来击败美国侵略者！
    美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日的挑战声明以及随之而来的军事行动，是美帝国主义在战后所一贯采取的扩张侵略政策的进一步表现，是第二次大战结束以来所未有的国际严重事件。
    六月十七日至二十一日，美国务卿艾奇逊的特别顾问杜勒斯到了汉城和“三八线”。六月十八日至二十三日，美国防部长詹逊和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷到了日本。在詹逊和布莱德雷返抵美国的次日，即六月二十五日拂晓，李承晚的伪国防军进攻“三八线”，发动全面内战。同一天，美国劫持下的联合国安全理事会，诬控朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的反击为对南朝鲜的“侵略”，并通过关于朝鲜局势的非法决定。六月二十七日，美总统杜鲁门发表破坏远东和平威胁世界和平的声明，公然宣布实行武装干涉朝鲜内战，武装阻挠中国人民解放台湾，并加强对越南和菲律宾反动傀儡政府的军事援助。与杜鲁门发表声明的同时，麦克阿瑟所统率的海空军已参加对朝鲜人民军的作战，美驻太平洋第七舰队也侵入了控制台湾的中国领海。由此可见，美帝国主义一手布置了朝鲜内战，并以此作为进一步侵略朝鲜，侵略台湾，侵略越南、菲律宾和东南亚各地的借口。
    六月二十七日以前美帝国主义还伪装“不干涉他国内政”，伪装“尊重其他会员国的领土完整和主权独立”，伪装“对台湾或中国其它领土从无掠夺野心”，伪装是“亚洲人民的朋友”。所有这些原则、约束和诺言，都包含在美国政府所接受的联合国宪章、开罗宣言、波茨坦公告等国际协定中，包含在杜鲁门和艾奇逊所发表的历次声明中。但是，以杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明为转折点的新侵略行动，横暴地破坏了一切国际协定和声明，从而撕毁了美帝国主义一向所戴上的假面具。中国人民、朝鲜人民以及全亚洲人民可以清楚地看出：在六月二十七日以前，美帝国主义是一个不肯完全抛头露面的骗子，在六月二十七日以后，就不得不变成一个穷凶极恶的强盗了。
    美帝国主义为什么不继续做骗子，而要做强盗呢？这是因为美帝国主义的所谓“亚洲政策”已彻底破产，挑拨离间和威胁利诱的流氓手段，已黔驴技穷。东方人民的觉悟程度正在迅速提高，革命力量正在迅速增长。这种形势引起了帝国主义内部和美国统治阶级内部的混乱不安，从而产生了日益普遍的失败主义情绪。一切缓进的、隐蔽的侵略政策，再也不能达到它的帝国主义目的。美帝国主义就像德日法西斯一样，走向公开而直接的武装干涉。所以，杜鲁门所发动的新侵略行动，并不是表示对美帝国主义的前途有信心，而是表示缺乏信心，更不是表示美帝国主义力量的强大，而是表示美帝国主义力量的脆弱。
    美帝国主义的武装干涉，绝对不能阻止中国人民解放台湾。台湾是一定要解放的，也一定能解放的。中国人民已经把美帝国主义势力及其所支持的蒋介石反动集团逐出中国大陆，取得了革命的历史性胜利。因此中国人民有充分的信心和经验，把他们的敌人逐出台湾和一切属于中国的领土。美帝国主义的武装干涉，也绝对不能阻止朝鲜人民解放全国。从六月二十五日至二十八日的四天中，朝鲜人民军已经取得了初步的重大胜利，解放了包括首都汉城在内的十三个主要城市和将近两万平方公里的广大地区。被迫进行正义的革命战争的朝鲜人民，将因美国武装部队的直接参加作战而更奋勇前行，再接再厉地给予美国干涉军和李承晚伪军以沉重的打击。同时，美帝国主义的武装干涉，自然也不能恫吓正在争取解放的东方被压迫民族和人民。他们将因美帝国主义强盗面貌的原形暴露，而提高他们的敌忾心和警惕性。
    中国人民已经翻身。全亚洲人民已经觉醒。帝国主义者干涉亚洲事务的殖民时代，已经过去。发动“九一八”事变，建立“大东亚共荣圈”的日本法西斯，已经被中国人民和全亚洲人民所打败。武装干涉朝鲜内战、干涉台湾解放、干涉越南、菲律宾以及东南亚各国内政的美帝国主义，必然将遭遇同样的命运。历史会证明这一点。
    北大西洋侵略集团遭遇着新挫折
    一切迹象显示：帝国主义国家内部的矛盾，不是按照美国垄断资本集团的主观愿望在缩小和解消，而是按照历史的辩证规律在扩大和发展。伦敦会议后的北大西洋侵略集团，正遭遇着愈来愈严重的困难。
    美帝国主义的所谓“总体外交”，即旨在统一帝国主义国家内部以发动进攻苏联和人民民主国家的新侵略战争的法西斯外交，曾在五月间的伦敦会议中达到了一个新阶段。在艾奇逊的导演和操纵之下，西方仆从国家——主要是英、法两国的代表们，接受了美国进一步加速战争准备的扩张计划。由十二国外长参加的北大西洋公约理事会会议，曾决定立即组成一个指挥北大西洋侵略集团全面备战活动的常设机构——外长助理会议，而以美国的具有独裁大权的“超人”，作为这一常设机构的当然主席。由艾奇逊、贝文和舒曼参加的美英法三外长会议，曾决定在事实媾和的掩饰下，长期占领西德，并使西德成为北大西洋侵略集团的一员。在伦敦会议期间，华盛顿的忠实走狗、法国外长舒曼，奉命提出要求西欧各国放弃其“和平时期的国家主权”以服务于美帝国主义战争政策的所谓法德煤钢联营计划。这些决定和计划的目的，就是要把西欧国家的战争潜力统一在由美帝国主义一手控制的“超国家机构”中，而以西德的军火工业和法西斯雇佣军作为北大西洋侵略集团的重心和骨干。否则美帝国主义要发动新侵略战争将是不可能的。
    然而，美帝国主义在加紧推行其扩张政策的道路上，绝对不是横行无阻的。恰恰相反，它正受到新的挫折。例如，虽然只有一个多月的时间，战贩艾奇逊大事吹嘘的所谓“冷战内阁”，现在已变成一个大不相同的技术性机构。美国和英国，尤其是美国所派遣的代表，已经不是“才干最大”的“超人”，而是无声无臭的“侏儒”。谁都可以看出，像这样的常设机构和代表人物，显然无法完成北大西洋侵略集团所赋予的侵略任务。与此同时，大吹大擂的舒曼计划也被证明越来越像昙花一现的肥皂泡。英国直率地拒绝参加关于舒曼计划的谈判。英国工党发表了反对西欧经济“整体化”的声明。在巴黎举行的六国会议中，各国代表间的意见发生严重的分歧，使谈判毫无进展，目前六国会议已因皮杜尔——舒曼内阁的垮台而宣告搁浅。
    这些情况说明：在美帝国主义力图建立以北大西洋侵略集团为中心的世界霸权和世界帝国的这一狂妄计划面前，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾对立是发展了，更趋尖锐化了。因为华尔街所制造的“超人”或“超国家机构”，不仅要求所有仆从国家放弃其政治上、军事上和外交上的一切主权，并且要求那些国家的统治阶级出让他们自己的经济利益。这就不能不引起他们的抵抗。北大西洋公约理事会常设机构的难产和弱化，舒曼计划的濒于流产，暴露出独占资本主义本身所包含的不可克服的弱点。
