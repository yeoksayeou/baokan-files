Comrade Zheng Yansheng Sends Letter Suggesting:
　　When I see A, B, C, D used as one, two, three, four in newspapers, documents, and books, I never know which item or how many questions are being discussed, and I have to carefully count again to know how many questions are being discussed. This is because I don't understand English. I think that foreign languages ​​can be avoided or used as little as possible in cases where they are not necessary. Because numbers like one, two, three, four... 1, 2, 3, 4... or (1), (2)... or (1), (2), etc. are sufficient to use.
                                                 Reader Zheng Yansheng
    Editor's Note: Comrade Zheng Yansheng's opinion is correct. On this issue, his opinion reflects the opinions of the vast majority of readers who have not learned foreign languages, especially the opinions of workers and peasants. When Chinese people write articles for Chinese people to read, it is completely unnecessary to use foreign words to represent numbers such as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. This is also a kind of colonial influence. I hope that authors, reporters, and correspondents will pay attention to this issue in the future.

### 写作时勿掺用不必要的外文  郑雁声同志来信建议

　　写作时勿掺用不必要的外文
    郑雁声同志来信建议编辑同志：
    看到报上、文件、书籍中用Ａ、Ｂ、Ｃ、Ｄ当作一二三四的时候，总不知是说到了第几项或第几个问题，必须再用心数一遍才能知道它谈了几个问题。这是因为我不懂英文的原因。我认为外国文在一些不必要采用的情况下，可以不用或尽量少用。因为一、二、三、四……１、２、３、４……或（一）、（二）……或（１）、（２）等数字是足够使用的。
                                                 读者郑雁声
    编者按：郑雁声同志的意见是对的。在这一个问题上，他的意见反映了广大的没有学过外国文的读者的意见，其中主要又是工农读者的意见。中国人写文章给中国人看，要用外国字来表示１、２、３、４等数目字，完全没有必要的，这也是殖民地化的影响的一种，希望作者们、记者们、通讯员们以后都注意这个问题。
