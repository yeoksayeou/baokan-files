　　Readers of this newspaper write in succession expressing
    determination to defeat the American imperialist aggression
    [This newspaper dispatch] The American imperialists' open aggression against Korea and interference in the liberation of Taiwan have aroused the indignation of the entire Chinese people. Readers of this newspaper have written to this newspaper, expressing their sympathy and support for the Korean people, and expressing their determination to expel American imperialism and liberate Taiwan.
    Wang Wuxin of Jilin Paper Mill wrote: "The American imperialists' aggressive actions fully expose the hideous face of American imperialism. We warn these warmongering bandits: Taiwan is the territory of the Chinese people and American imperialism is absolutely not allowed to invade it; the Korean people have the right to unify their own country, and it is by no means something that the Syngman Rhee bandit gang and American imperialism can obstruct. At the same time, we declare that whoever dares to stop us from liberating Taiwan will definitely get their heads bashed in."
    The joint letter from readers Yang Zhenfeng, Du Huanglun, and Chen Shifang pointed out: "We want to tell the American imperialist war-mongers: Taiwan belongs to the Chinese people, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao defeated Japanese imperialism, defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, defeated the aggressive forces of American imperialism in mainland China, and liberated all of mainland China except Tibet. Taiwan must never be allowed to become a colony of the American imperialists."
    Qiu Mingbao of Minsheng Construction Factory said: "The failure of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique's provocations against the Korean people has made the working people of the world more clearly realize that American imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, just a paper tiger."

　　本报读者纷纷来信表示
    决心打败美帝侵略
    【本报讯】美帝国主义公开侵略朝鲜和干涉台湾的解放，激起全中国人民的愤慨，本报读者纷纷写信给本报，表示对朝鲜人民的同情与声援，并决心驱逐美帝国主义，解放台湾。
    吉林造纸厂王物新来信说：“美帝国主义者的侵略行动，充分暴露了美帝国主义的狰狞面目。我们警告这些好战的匪徒们：台湾是中国人民的领土，决不允许美帝国主义侵略；朝鲜人民有权统一自己的国家，决非李承晚匪帮及美帝国主义所能阻挠。同时，我们声明谁敢阻挡我们解放台湾，谁就一定会碰得焦头烂额。”
    读者杨振凤、杜黄伦、陈世芳的联名信中指出：“我们要告诉美帝国主义战争贩子们：台湾是中国人民的，中国人民一定要解放台湾。毛主席领导的人民解放军，打败了日本帝国主义，打败了国民党反动派，打败了美帝国主义在中国大陆的侵略势力，解放了除西藏以外的中国全部大陆，台湾也决不能让它变成美帝国主义者的殖民地。”
    民生营造厂邱明宝说：“美帝国主义和李承晚傀儡集团对朝鲜人民挑衅的失败，使全世界劳动人民更清楚地认识到美帝国主义外强中干，只是一只纸老虎。”
