　　The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, implementing advanced labor laws, has thoroughly eliminated the colonial and feudal remnants of exploitation caused by the long-term rule of Japanese imperialism. Workers, as masters of nationalized factories, mines, and enterprises, and as the main force in the construction of a democratic fatherland, are able to wage active struggles for the prosperity and development of the fatherland and the improvement of people's lives.

    Led by the working class, all working people in the northern half of the Republic have overfulfilled two national economic plans. They are now vividly launching patriotic production increase campaigns to complete and overfulfill the new two-year national economic plan ahead of schedule. This, on the one hand, further consolidates the material foundation of the democratic fatherland; on the other hand, it continuously improves their material and cultural standards.

    Since the implementation of the labor law, the improvement of the living standards of workers and staff has been clearly demonstrated by the continued growth of their actual wages.

    The wage principle of "to each according to his work" not only continuously improves the technical level and labor productivity of workers, but also leads to a substantial increase in workers' wages. If the average basic wage index for 1948 is taken as 100, then the first quarter of 1950 is 124.1 percent. The index of basic wages for piece-rate workers, if the first quarter of 1947 is taken as 100, then the same quarter of 1950 is 138.5 percent. In particular, since Resolution No. 196 of the Cabinet, not only has labor productivity increased, but the wage income of workers has also increased significantly.

    In order to enable workers to work with peace of mind, the welfare conditions of labor protection facilities formulated by the Cabinet have played a huge role in the growth of workers' wages and the improvement of labor productivity.

    In factories, mines, and various enterprises, from April 1949 to March 1950, in just one year, 208,154 safety facilities and 155,604 sanitary facilities were added. The collective contract, which was re-established in May this year, is scheduled to have more than 11,000 safety facilities and more than 3,200 sanitary facilities. In particular, the implementation of the policy of protecting female and child labor has increased the number of female workers and staff by 312.1 percent in March this year compared with March 1947. This has not only cultivated a large number of technical personnel, but also guaranteed the healthy development of child labor in terms of physical and intellectual aspects.

    The actual wages of workers and staff have shown a large increase after the implementation of price reductions.

    With the rapid development of the people's economy, the Republic's government implemented reductions in the state-set prices of necessities. The prices of goods in state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives, if October 1947 is taken as 100, were reduced to 66.6 percent in the first quarter of 1950. At the same time, the market price index is also continuing to decline, so the purchasing power of workers and staff is constantly increasing.

    In 1949, the Republic's government allocated necessities worth 1,331,860,000 won at low state-set prices. In addition, uniforms and other necessities worth 261 million won were provided to workers, technicians, and staff free of charge.

    Not only that, but various welfare facilities for workers and staff in various enterprises have made their lives increasingly prosperous. The index of these facility expenses, if June 1949 is taken as 100, has increased to 150.3 percent by March 1950. In particular, the number of houses inhabited by workers and staff increased to 154,959 households by 1948, and will increase to 201,730 households by the end of 1950. In addition, collective dormitories for single people are also being built and expanded on a large scale.

    At the same time, the workers and staff in the northern half of the Republic, whose material lives are prosperous, are constantly improving their cultural standards.

    The expansion of cultural facilities in factories, mines, and various enterprises has enabled workers and staff to satisfy their cultural desires.

    The increase index of cultural facilities in factories, mines, and various enterprises, if June 1949 is set at 100, has increased to 112.6 percent by March this year.

    Various art groups are widely organized in various work units, producing many excellent works. Recently, in the struggle to strive for the early completion of the two-year plan, work units issued work newsletters to reflect and promote construction work.

    The social insurance implemented according to the labor law enables workers and staff to further widely enjoy material and cultural benefits. The Republic's government spent 700 million won on social insurance in 1949 alone.

    In the first quarter of 1950, the number of workers, staff, and their families who received medical assistance and various pensions and subsidies reached 2,773,743. The number of people entering sanatoriums in 1950 will increase by 257.8 percent compared with 1947, and the number of people entering rest homes will increase by 2,801.1 percent.

    According to Resolution No. 114 of the Cabinet, social insurance should be expanded in scope and ratio, and cultural and health facilities should also be greatly expanded.

    The working people in the northern half, who regard labor as the highest glory, have guaranteed the above achievements by developing creativity and initiative and exerting noble patriotic efforts to develop the national economy.

    Under the new conditions of labor, the working people in the northern half of the Republic have thoroughly realized that their labor is for the prosperity of the fatherland and the happiness of the future.

    They are striving for greater achievements in the patriotic production increase competition to complete and overfulfill the two-year national economic plan ahead of schedule.

    Workers at the Jinhua Mine completed the two-year plan on March 1 this year, and by the end of May, they had overfulfilled the two-year plan by 146.2 percent. The Chuanneili Cement Factory completed the two-year plan by 147.1 percent at the end of May this year. There are many other factories and mines that have overfulfilled the two-year national economic plan.

    The movement to reduce the won (Korean currency) unit led by Comrade Gao Yingshu of the Pyongyang Chemical Factory (the purpose of this movement is: the factory should bring more than 10 million won of benefits to the country in May alone) is developing widely. In the struggle to exceed transportation standards, the most noteworthy is that all the drivers of the Gaoyuan Engine Section, led by Comrade Song Zaiming, overfulfilled the task of towing freight cars with 22 locomotives actually running from May 16 to 31, saving more than 280 tons of coal.

    In this way, in the patriotic production increase competition, workers and staff continue their firm struggle in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland as soon as possible and to promote the implementation of labor laws throughout the country.

　　朝鲜北部劳动人民生活水平的提高
    黄兢译
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，实施了先进的劳动法令，把日本帝国主义的长斯统治所造成的殖民地的、封建的剥削残余，彻底消灭。工人做了国有化工厂、矿山及企业机构的主人，做了民主祖国建设的主力军，他们能够为了祖国的富强与发展和人民生活的提高，进行主动的斗争。
    以工人阶级为领导的共和国北半部全体劳动人民，已超额完成了两次国民经济计划。现在正为了提前完成和超额完成国民经济新二年计划，生动地展开爱国增产竞赛运动。这在一方面，进一步巩固着民主祖国的物质基础；另一方面，不断提高着自己的物质和文化水平。
    自从劳动法令实施以来，工人和职员生活水平的提高从他们的实际工资的继续增长中，很明显地表现出来。
    按劳取酬的工资原则，不但使劳动者的技术水平和劳动生产率不断提高，而且使工人的工资也有长足的增长。如果将一九四八年度平均基本工资指数作为一百，则一九五○年第一季是百分之一二四·一。包工工人基本工资的指数，如果将一九四七年第一季作为一百，则到一九五○年同季是百分之一三八·五。特别是自从部长会议第一九六号决议以后，不但劳动生产率提高了，而且工人的工资收入也有了显著的增加。
    为了使工人能够安心工作，部长会议所制定的劳动保护设施的福利条件，在工人工资的增长和劳动生产率的提高上起了巨大的作用。
    在工厂、矿山及各企业机构中，自一九四九年四月至一九五○年三月，仅在一年期间内，即添设了安全设施二○八、一五四件和卫生设施一五五、六○四件。今年五月重新订立集体合同，预定将具备安全设施一一、○○○余件和卫生设施三、二○○余件。特别是对女工和童工的保护政策的实行，今年三月使女工及女职员的数目与一九四七年三月相比增加到百分之三一二·一。其中不但培养出大批技术人员，而且保障童工的体力及智力方面的健全发展。
    工人及职员的实际工资，在物价实行降低以后，表现出很大的增加。
    随着人民经济的急速发展，共和国政府实行降低生活必需品的国定价格。国营商店及消费合作社商品价格，若以一九四七年十月作为一百，则一九五○年第一季降低到百分之六六·六。同时市场物价指数也在继续降低，因此工人及职员的购买力不断地提高了。
    共和国政府在一九四九年度就以低廉的国定价格配给了价值十三亿三千一百八十六万元朝币的生活必需品。此外还将价值相当于二亿六千一百万元朝币的制服及其他生活必需品无偿地供给工人、技术人员及职员。
    不仅如此，在各企业机构中，对于工人及职员的各种福利设施，已使它们的生活日益充裕。这些设施经费的指数若以一九四九年六月作为一百，则到一九五○年三月，已增加到百分之一五○·三。特别是工人及职员们居住的住宅，到一九四八年增加到一五四、九五九户，到一九五○年度末，则将增加到二○一、七三○户。此外，独身者集体宿舍也正在大规模的建设和扩张中。
    同时，物质生活充裕的共和国北半部的工人职员们，正在不断提高自己的文化水平。
    在工厂、矿山及各企业机构中文化设施的扩充使工人职员们得以满足他们在文化上的欲望。
    在工厂、矿山及各企业机构中，文化设施的增加指数，若以一九四九年六月定为一百，则到今年三月已增加到百分之一一二·六。
    各个工作单位都广泛地组织着各种艺术团体，产生很多的优秀作品。最近在争取提前完成二年计划的斗争中，各工作单位发行工作通讯，用以反映并推动建设工作。
    根据劳动法令所实施的社会保险使工人及职员能够进一步广泛地享受物质与文化上的恩惠。共和国政府在一九四九年一年之内单为社会保险事业，就支出了七亿元朝币。
    在一九五○年第一季中，工人、职员及其家属获得医疗上补助和各种年金及补助金的人数实达二、七七三、七四三名，在一九五○年入疗养所的人数与一九四七年相比将增至百分之二五七·八，入休养所的人数增至百分之二、八○一·一。
    根据部长会议第一一四号的决议，社会保险要扩大范围及其比率，同时文化及保健设施也要大大的扩充。
    以劳动为无上光荣的北半部劳动人民，为了发展国民经济，发挥着创造性和积极性，尽着高尚的爱国的努力，这才使上述的一些成就有了保障。
    共和国北半部劳动人民，在劳动的新条件下，彻底地认识到自己的劳动是为了祖国的繁荣和未来的幸福。
    他们便在提前和超额完成国民经济二年计划的爱国增产竞赛中争取着更大的成就。
    金化矿山工人们，今年三月一日已完成了二年计划，到五月底，他们以百分之一四六·二超额完成了二年计划。川内里水泥工厂在今年五月底已以百分之一四七·一完成了二年计划。其他超额完成着国民经济二年计划的工厂和矿山还有许多。
    平壤化学工厂高英淑同志带头的减低圆（朝币）单位的运动，（这运动的目的就是：该工厂仅在五月一个月之内，要使国家得到一千余万元朝币的利益）正广泛地发展着。在争取超过运输标准的斗争中，最值得指出的就是高原机关区由宋在明同志为首的全体司机们自五月十六日起至三十一日止期间内，使实际转动的二十二辆机车都超额完成了曳引货车的任务，节省了煤炭二百八十余吨。
    这样，在爱国增产竞赛中，工人和职员为了早日达成祖国的和平统一，为了促进全国范围内实施劳动法令，继续着坚强的斗争。
