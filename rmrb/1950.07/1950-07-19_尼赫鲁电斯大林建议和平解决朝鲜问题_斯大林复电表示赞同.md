　　Nehru Cables Stalin Suggesting Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue
    Stalin Replies Approvingly
    Agrees to handle the matter through a Security Council attended by representatives of the five major powers, including China, and proposes hearing the views of the Korean people's representatives in the Security Council.
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 18th, Moscow Dispatch] TASS Moscow, July 18th: Newspapers today published Nehru's cable to Stalin, Stalin's reply to Nehru, and Nehru's further cable to Stalin. The texts are as follows:
    Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, telegram to Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, July 13:
    My country's ambassador in Moscow has explained to your Ministry of Foreign Affairs India's attitude towards the Korean conflict. India's objective is to localize the conflict and assist in a swift and peaceful resolution by removing the current deadlock in the Security Council so that the representative of the People's Republic of China can take its place in the Security Council and the Soviet Union can return to the Security Council; and so that the Soviet Union, the United States, and China can, within the framework of the Security Council or outside the Security Council, through informal contacts, with the assistance and cooperation of other peace-loving countries, seek a basis for stopping the conflict and for the final resolution of the Korean issue. Fully confident in Your Excellency's determination to defend peace and thereby maintain the unity of the United Nations, I venture to address this personal appeal to you, requesting that you use your high authority and influence to achieve this common goal on which the well-being of mankind depends.
    With the highest respect,
    Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin's reply to Mr. Nehru:
    To His Excellency Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Republic of India: I welcome your peace initiative. I fully agree with your view that the Korean issue should be peacefully handled through a Security Council that must include representatives of the five major powers, including the People's Republic of China. I believe that it is appropriate to hear the views of the representatives of the Korean people in the Security Council for the rapid resolution of the Korean issue.
    Respectfully,
                          Joseph Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR
                             July 15th
    Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, telegram to Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, July 16th: To His Excellency Joseph Stalin, Premier of the Soviet Union:
    Deeply grateful for Your Excellency's prompt and encouraging reply. I will immediately contact other relevant governments and hope to cable you again soon.
    Respectfully,
                        Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India

　　尼赫鲁电斯大林建议和平解决朝鲜问题
    斯大林复电表示赞同
    同意经由包括我国在内的五大国代表参加的安理会来处理，并提出在安理会上听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：各报今天刊载尼赫鲁致斯大林电、斯大林致尼赫鲁复电以及尼赫鲁再致斯大林电，电文如下：
    印度总理潘迪特·雅瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生七月十三日致苏联部长会议主席约·维·斯大林电
    敝国大使在莫斯科与贵国外交部谈话中，已说明了印度对于朝鲜冲突的态度。印度的目的在于使冲突局部化，并协助迅速地和平解决，其办法为消除安全理事会中目前的僵局，以便使中国人民政府的代表能在安全理事会占有其地位，苏联能回到安全理事会来；并使苏联、美国和中国能在安全理事会机构以内，或者在安全理事会以外，经由非正式的接触，在其他爱好和平国家协助和合作之下，为停止冲突，并为朝鲜问题的最后解决寻求基础。我完全确信阁下保卫和平从而维持联合国的团结的决心，所以敢向您提出这种个人的呼吁，请运用您的崇高权威和影响来达成人类的幸福所依托的这一共同目标。
    谨致最崇高的敬意
    约·维·斯大林复尼赫鲁先生电
    印度共和国总理潘迪特·雅瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生阁下：我欢迎您的和平创议。您认为宜经由包括中国人民政府在内的五大国的代表必须参加的安全理事会，来使朝鲜问题得到和平处理，这一观点，我完全赞同。我相信，为了朝鲜问题的迅速解决，在安全理事会上听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见，是适宜的。
    敬礼
                          苏联部长会议主席约·斯大林
                             七月十五日
    印度总理潘迪特·雅瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生七月十六日致约·维·斯大林电苏联总理约·斯大林阁下：
    承蒙阁下迅即给予令人兴奋的复电，至为感激。我将立刻与其他有关各国政府接洽，希望不久就能再致电阁下。
