　　Fur Company Implements Commissioned Processing and Acquisition of Finished Products
　　Actively Supports Carpet and Fur Industry Production

　　[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing branch of the North China Fur Company organized unemployed carpet workers into carpet groups, supplying them with wool yarn for production, and commissioned Yi Hua and other factories to spin and dye wool yarn, actively promoting carpet industry production. It also supported private fur workshops through commissioned processing and acquisition of finished products. Significant results have been achieved in restoring and developing carpet and fur production. Carpets are a special handicraft for which China is world-renowned. The Beijing carpet industry has a history of over thirty years. During its peak, there were over three hundred factories of various sizes, producing over one hundred thousand square feet per month, making it a major export product for China. After the Anti-Japanese War, it suffered various suppressions by the Japanese puppet regime and almost completely ceased production. After the establishment of the Fur Company's Beijing branch in September of last year, it began investigating the carpet industry situation. From November onwards, it began organizing unemployed or re-employed carpet workers. As of June of this year, it had organized over three hundred and forty workers into eighty-six carpet groups, establishing contracts, commissioning processing, and supplying workers with wool yarn for production. Under the current circumstances, it can produce over seven thousand square feet of carpet per month. Since the beginning of commissioned carpet weaving, the company has recovered twenty-nine thousand six hundred square feet of carpet, with an additional eight thousand seven hundred square feet currently being processed. The total wages paid amounted to over three hundred and sixty-eight thousand catties of millet. In addition, it commissioned the Yi Hua factory to spin over twenty-eight thousand seven hundred catties of wool yarn, and the Kaiyuan and other three factories to dye over forty-eight thousand catties of wool yarn. The processing fees converted to over one hundred and thirty thousand catties of millet.
　　Since May, the company has commissioned over twenty private fur workshops to process a total of sixty-seven thousand nine hundred and thirty-two various finished hides. It also commissioned the processing of four thousand six hundred and seventy-nine sheep leg skin rugs and lambskin rugs, with the processing fees for both items totaling over ninety-five thousand catties of millet when converted to millet. In addition, it ordered two thousand seven hundred and fifty sheep leg skin rugs from private workshops, totaling over 157.7 million yuan. The purchase contract stipulated that the company would first pay 80 percent of the payment.
