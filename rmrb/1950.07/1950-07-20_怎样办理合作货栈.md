How to Run a Cooperative Freight Station
　　Zhou Jun

The North China Cooperative Freight Station officially started its business in September last year. At that time, based on the needs of various cooperatives, it operated its own business and also acted as a trust business (buying and selling on behalf of various cooperatives), charging a certain handling fee (50% lower than private businesses). From January to June, the total transaction volume was 180.3 billion yuan, of which local products flowing into the city accounted for 54%, and industrial products flowing into the countryside accounted for 46%. Warehouse storage did not charge rent, it was not treated as a business, there were no formal procedures or accounts, and it was not taken seriously in terms of thinking. Only two cadres were temporarily assigned to manage it, which caused constant problems, such as wrong delivery of goods and neglect of storage. Later, as business expanded and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas increased, warehouse services were added, charging lower storage rents, and clarifying "responsibility for mistakes, compensation for losses." From then on, it was operated seriously, charged reasonable fees, and cadres paid attention to it ideologically, strengthening storage management. From January to June, the total throughput was 267.7 million jin. The current problem is the lack of research, learning, and emphasis on warehouse technology. In the past six months, due to lack of experience and improper storage, the loss of people's property was estimated at 60 million yuan. In the future, storage personnel must study the nature, characteristics, shelf life, and moisture content of each commodity, and even hire warehouse experts for guidance if necessary, to improve from the existing level of storage management to achieve "skillful storage."

With the development of business, the deposits of residents (proceeds from sales) and short-term loans (purchase price differences, insufficient freight) have also increased. In order to facilitate the lending of cooperatives at all levels and to enable mutual assistance in funds between cooperatives, temporary deposit mortgages and credit loans were handled in conjunction with the bank. From January to the end of June, the total amount of deposits and loans was 92 billion yuan, of which deposits were 65.37 billion yuan, and loans were 26.62 billion yuan. Deposits accounted for a strong 71%, and loans accounted for a weak 29%. However, from the above figures of more deposits and fewer loans, it shows that this business has not yet been seriously developed. There are excessive restrictions on the amount of loans. In the future, business should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to balance deposits and loans, except for a certain reserve fund, to give full play to its greater role. This should still be done in the stage where freight stations exist for purchasing and selling on behalf of others. It absorbs the idle funds of various cooperatives entering the city, organizes them, and supports friendly cooperatives with short-term loans. Through credit business, the cooperation of the cooperative system can be enhanced and the turnover of goods can be accelerated. According to several months of experience, various cooperatives welcome this kind of business. However, a certain relationship should be established with the bank as a backup, and the interest rate difference should be minimized. The deposit interest rate should be higher and the loan interest rate should be lower. But it should be reasonable, and the deposit and loan targets should be clearly defined, limited to cooperatives, and deposits and loans from non-residents should not be made.

In addition, the freight station has also carried out transportation business according to the specific situation and work needs of Tianjin, with a total of 29,281 tons of materials transported in four months. The development of this business not only reduced the commodity costs of various cooperatives (the transportation handling fees of other transportation departments are 100% higher than those of the freight station), but also greatly accelerated the turnover of commodities. At the same time, because railway transportation is planned, the cooperative has also strengthened the planning of transportation, and the planning of business has also been strengthened accordingly. The cadres of the freight station do not pay enough attention to this work, and only stay at the level of completing tasks. In the future, transportation cadres should be educated to calculate transportation costs in a timely manner, provide reference for the business operations of various cooperatives, study packaging, reduce losses, and rationalize transportation damage.

Some problems encountered from several months of exploration and experience:

1. The nature and tasks of the freight station should be clarified:

The cooperative freight station is a component of the same-level cooperatives, but it is different from a store or business office. It is a trust institution of the cooperative, dedicated to serving cooperatives in various places, especially those coming to this city to do business (of course, it also serves the same-level cooperatives). Many freight stations in North China do not have a clear understanding of this nature. Generally speaking, they serve the local general cooperative and become the business department of the local general cooperative. Some general cooperatives require the freight station to hand in a certain number of tasks every month, which becomes an organ production nature; some serve state-owned companies; this is not in line with the spirit of serving cooperatives at all levels coming to this city to do business. The North China Cooperative Freight Station was also vague about this at the beginning. In the ten months of exploration, we believe that its tasks should be:

1. The freight station serves cooperatives from various places coming to this city to do business, and actively assists them in solving difficult problems.
2. Introduce and organize business between cooperatives, between cooperatives and the state-owned economy, and between cooperatives and private enterprises, so that industrial and agricultural products can be directly exchanged to reduce intermediate exploitation. Adopt a contract system to gradually overcome blindness in operation and move towards planning.
3. Unify the purchase and sale business entrusted by various cooperatives in order to cooperate with the local government's management of the market and the control of prices.
4. Organize the idle funds of various cooperatives in the station to promote mutual support and assistance in funds.
5. Provide timely information on market conditions for reference in the business operations of various cooperatives.
6. Provide food and accommodation for people from various cooperatives entering the city, organize learning, exchange experience, and provide appropriate management.

2. Cooperative freight stations should not operate on their own:

Since the freight station is a trust institution of the cooperative, it should serve various cooperatives with 100% of its strength. If it engages in business on its own, it will relax the business of various cooperatives, easily change the nature of the freight station, reduce its efficiency, and reduce its active role in serving various cooperatives. For example, the North China Cooperative Freight Station had its own operations from the beginning. Although the starting point was to solve the problem of "goods from various cooperatives being difficult to sell due to seasonal or supply and demand relationships, and timely supply from remote procurement," the result of implementation was problematic. For example, more than 30 cadres were engaged in managing local products, of which only one cadre and two temporary staff were assigned to promote local products to cooperatives at all levels, and most of the strength was put on operating their own business. When operating grain on their own, they first sold their own grain, relaxing the promotion of grain from various cooperatives. When operating cloth on their own, they always wanted to push out the slow-moving goods first. After the self-operation was cancelled in May, the local products stored by various cooperatives for several months were sold out in less than a month (only one or two kinds of medicinal materials that could not be promoted at all were not sold), and the business was also greatly developed. The agency business was 7 billion yuan in April, 13.7 billion yuan in May, and more than 30.7 billion yuan in June, with each salesman averaging 37.4 million yuan per day. The freight station's own operation creates an antagonistic economic relationship between buyers and sellers. The freight station requires buying cheaply and selling dearly, and the guests require the freight station to sell dearly and buy cheaply, forming a contradiction. The guests dare not believe the freight station, and spread rumors everywhere, and the freight station's work cannot be done well. This shows that it is correct for the freight station not to operate on its own, and the difficulties in the freight station's business operations should be supported by the same-level cooperatives. This saves cadres, funds, and strength can be concentrated.

3. Handling agency purchase and sale using a contract system has a positive effect on gradually realizing the planned operation of various cooperatives' businesses. The freight station first signs agreements or contracts for the exchange of industrial and agricultural products with various cooperatives, and delivers goods according to the contract, which can overcome blindness and reduce transportation costs, and should be widely adopted.

4. Overemphasizing administrative management is not as good as strengthening business operations. The North China Cooperative Freight Station used to emphasize administrative management and neglect business operations because it was located in various lower-level cooperatives. Tasks were not completed, and it was unknown when they would be completed. Some cadres were arrogant to the guests, causing a lot of opinions. After strengthening agency purchase and sale, by comparing the completion time and price for the guests, the business gradually increased.

5. The freight station plays a great role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. It is a hub for the direct exchange of industrial and agricultural products, organizing scattered businesses and promoting them outwards in a planned way. The central link is to find sales channels for local products, because if local products cannot be sold, there is no way to talk about material exchange, and industrial and agricultural products cannot be exchanged. In the past few months, we did not grasp this link tightly, and the promotion of local products only accounted for 18% of the total transaction volume. The local products were suppressed and could not be sold, which affected the exchange of materials. By the end of June, it reached 54%, which drove the business of various cooperatives and accelerated the exchange.

6. The cooperative freight station is different from a private freight station hotel. In addition to strengthening business operations and serving various cooperatives well, guests should be given appropriate reception, management, and education. In order to take care of the guests' lives and studies, we organized a staff and guest consumer cooperative to supply daily necessities, and there were preferential measures for watching movies, bathing, and haircuts; we organized a guest learning and life inspection committee, which managed itself; and there was a library for guests to read. In the past, we only paid attention to ourselves and ignored the residents.

7. To do a good job in the freight station, "style" is the key. Before May, the North China Cooperative Freight Station had a very serious bureaucratic style. It was not enthusiastic about the guests, had little contact, and the business was passive, forming a "sitting and waiting for business," "hanging up a signboard, opening a big shop, whoever wants to come comes." The daily transaction volume decreased from 500 million yuan to more than 200 million yuan. After changing the style, the daily transaction volume rose to around 1.2 billion yuan, which shows that the harm of bureaucratic style to the cause is quite large.

8. In order to run the freight station well and implement the principle of "everyone's freight station, everyone runs it," a "resident cadre representative meeting" was established. The opinions of the residents are reflected through the representatives. The freight station then improves its work based on these opinions. The decisions of the freight station are discussed and approved by the representative meeting and implemented. Meetings are held every ten days. The organization of the representative meeting is that each province selects one representative, the freight station selects two representatives, and another secretary is hired to be responsible for convening meetings, sorting out records, supervising the handling of problems, and supervising the implementation of resolutions. According to this period of experience, implementing everyone's ideas, suggestions, and running the freight station well is a positive and effective method, and it also has a certain role in improving the work of the freight station and changing the style of cadres. For example, the first representative meeting put forward more than ten criticisms of the freight station, while the fourth meeting only put forward three opinions on living details. This shows the importance of resident representative meetings in improving work. Therefore, in freight stations in larger cities, where there are more residents and they stay for a longer time, this method should be adopted. In medium and small cities, freight stations with greater resident mobility should hold more symposiums to solicit opinions and improve work.

9. To do a good job in the freight station, we believe that the following basic conditions must be met, namely, fast transaction, reasonable price, maintaining credit, simplifying procedures, and providing thoughtful, warm, and kind service.

10. About the problem of farmer hostels:

They can be set up in small and medium cities and areas with developed industry and commerce in larger market towns; larger cities, although they have freight stations, can also set them up to solve the difficulties of nearby farmers entering the city for exchange. It has a closer economic relationship with the city and is also a part of the municipal construction work, and should be led by the local municipal cooperative. Its service objects are mainly farmers, and those who have not established freight stations should include cooperatives. The scope of business is not uniformly stipulated in North China, and it is not necessary to make a uniform stipulation at present. It should be decided according to the actual situation of the local area and the requirements of the farmers. In addition to agency buying and selling and providing food and accommodation, other businesses can be handled at discretion. The farmer hostel is a trust institution for farmers. In order to concentrate efforts to do things for farmers, it is best not to operate on its own. As for the difficulties in exchange, it can be solved by the local cooperative and entrusted to it for agency purchase and sale.

Problems that need to be studied and clarified in the future:

1. It has been nearly a year since freight stations were established in North China. Because there are no unified rules and regulations, their content is varied and has not played the role it should have. Unified rules and regulations should be formulated in the future to avoid new freight stations in various places taking detours again.

2. Agency purchase and sale is an important task of the freight station at this stage. Because of China's economic backwardness, it is too early for the cooperative economy to implement complete unified planned operation. Some products of cooperatives at all levels must be exchanged in the city by themselves, and blindness and anarchy are still inevitable. The freight station handles agency purchase and sale, organizes them, changes scattered ones into batches, and changes blind ones into planned ones, and then unifies them in a step-by-step manner for external purchase and sale. This is a scientific and progressive approach. However, some business personnel of various cooperatives are unwilling to be organized through the freight station and always want to do it themselves behind their backs, creating opportunities for speculators. For example, a certain prefectural cooperative spent more money buying agricultural tools and was also criticized by the newspaper. Some prefectural and county cooperatives saw that the provincial cooperative did not go through the freight station and did it themselves, and they followed suit, destroying the plan to organize business.

In addition, the practice of various cooperatives "sending people to purchase and sell" should be changed to the practice of "entrusting by letter" to save expenses and reduce the phenomenon of wasting cadres. At present, there are an average of about 170 cadres living in the station every day, which is a pity to idle a large number of capable cadres! In the future, freight stations with a foundation should gradually develop purchase and sale by letter, but the superior cooperative must have clear regulations. Just look at the large-scale international trade transactions, which are not made by sending people back and forth, but by handling transactions through letters and newspapers. We can try this based on the types and specifications of commodities.

3. Warehouse business occupies an important position in the cooperative cause. It manages all the materials of the cooperative. It is the hub of commodities from scattered to concentrated, and from concentrated to scattered. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to it, and only played the role of "preservation"; and it was not well preserved, let alone "management." In order to strengthen the unified management of the warehouse business, improve management technology, and reduce unnecessary losses of goods, the warehouses of various cooperatives, where there are freight stations, should be uniformly managed and operated by the freight station.

　　怎样办理合作货栈
    周钧
    华北合作货栈自去年九月正式开展业务，那时根据各社的需要，经营自身业务，兼作信托业务（代各社买卖），抽一定的手续费（低于私人百分之五十）。自一月至六月止交易总额为一、八○三亿元，其中流入城市的土产品占百分之五十四，流入乡村的工业品占百分之四十六。仓库存货不收栈租，未当一种业务来经营，没有正式手续帐目，思想上未重视起来，只派二个干部临时看管，因之不断发生问题，如发错货物，忽视保管等。后来因为业务开展，城乡物资交流日益增加，才增添了仓库业务，收较低的栈租，明确“错了要负责，损失要赔偿”。从此认真经营，合理收费，干部从思想上重视起来，加强了保管。自一月至六月，共吞吐量为二亿六千七百余万斤。而目前存在的问题，是缺乏仓库技术的研究、学习、重视，半年中因经验缺乏，保管不当，损失约计六千万元的人民财产。今后保管人员必须钻研每种商品的性质、特点、保存期、含潮量等，甚至聘请仓库专家作指导也是必要的，从现有的保管水平提高一步，以便作到“保管有方”。
    随着业务的开展，住客的存款（卖出货款）、短期借款（购货差数，运费不足数）也随之增多。为了便利各级社的借贷，使社与社间在资金上的互助，结合银行办理了临时存款抵押，信用放款，自一月至六月底，存贷总数九二○亿元，其中存入款为六五三亿七千余万元，贷出数二六六亿二千余万元，存入款占百分之七十一强，贷出占百分之二十九弱。但从以上存多贷少的数字上看，说明此项业务，还未认真开展。在借款数目过分加以限制，今后应加强经营，除留一定之准备金外，争取存贷平衡，以发挥其更大的作用。这在货栈存在代购代销的阶段，还是应当举办的。它吸收各社进城的闲散资金，加以组织，接济支持短期借款的友社。通过信用业务可以增强合作系统的合作性，加速了商品的周转。根据几个月的经验，各社是很欢迎此种业务的。但应与银行建立一定的关系作为后援，利率差额，尽量缩小，存款利息要高点，放款利息要低点。但要合理，要明确存贷对象，只限各合作社，非住客的存贷不作。
    此外，货栈还根据了天津市的具体情形，工作需要，开展了运输业务，四个月共运输物资二九、二八一吨。此项业务的开展，不但减低了各社的商品成本（其他运输部门的运输手续费高于货栈百分之百），而且对加速商品周转关系亦大。同时由于铁路是计划运输，使合作社也加强了运输上的计划性，业务的计划性亦随之加强。货栈干部对此工作重视不够，只停留在完成任务的水平上，今后应教育运输干部及时计算运输成本，供给各社经营业务的参考，研究包装，减少损失，作到运输伤耗合理化。
    从几个月的摸索体验当中，遇到的一些问题：
    一、货栈的性质、任务应当明确下来：
    合作货栈为同级社的组成部分，但它不同于门市部或经营处，它是合作社的信托机构，专为各地社服务，特别是为来本市经营业务的各地社服务（当然也为同级社服务）。华北区许多货栈对此性质是不够明确的。一般的说都是为当地总社服务，成为当地总社的经营部门，有的总社要求货栈每月交若干任务，成了机关生产性质；有的为国营公司服务；这对为来本市经营业务的各级社服务的精神，是不符合的。华北合作货栈开始时对此亦是模糊的，在十个月的摸索当中，我们认为其任务应是：
    １、货栈服务于来本市经营业务的各地社，积极协助他们解决困难问题。
    ２、介绍与组织社与社间，社与国营经济间，社与私人企业间的业务，使工农产品直接交换，以减少中间剥削，采用合同制，使经营逐渐克服盲目性，走向计划性。
    ３、统一经营各社委托的购销业务，以便配合当地政府对市场的管理，及物价的掌握。
    ４、组织来栈各社的闲散资金，促成在资金上的互相支持帮助作用。
    ５、及时通报商情，以便作各社经营业务的参考。
    ６、招待各社入城人员的食宿，组织学习，交流经验，并给予适当的管理。
    二、合作货栈不应当作自营：
    货栈既为合作社的信托机构，应以百分之百的力量，为各社服务，如果自己再经营业务，对各社的业务即形放松，即易改变货栈的性质，降低它的效能，减少了为各社服务的积极作用。如华北合作货栈一开始即有自营，其出发点虽是为了解决“各社来货，因季节或供求关系，不好出售，及远地采购及时供给”，但执行的结果，是有毛病的。如三十多个干部经营土产，其中只派一个干部，二个临时职员给各级社推销土产，大部力量放在经营自身的业务。自营粮食时，先售自己的粮，放松各社的粮食推销工作。自营布匹时，总想将冷货先推出去。五月份取销自营后，不到一个月即将各社存的几个月的土产卖完（只有一、二种药材根本不能推销者未卖出），业务也大大开展，四月份代营为七十亿元，五月份为一百三十七亿元，六月份为三百零七亿余元，每天每个业务员平均成交三、七四○万元。货栈自营，对买方卖方的客人，就在经济关系上，造成了对立的状态，货栈要求贱买贵卖，客人对货栈要求贵卖贱买，形成矛盾，客人对货栈不敢相信，到处传布，货栈工作即不可能搞好的。这说明货栈不作自营是正确的，而货栈在经营业务上的困难，应由同级社支持。这样节省干部，资金、力量又能集中。
    三、办理代购代销运用合同制，这对逐渐实现各社业务的计划经营是有积极作用的。货栈先给各社订好工农产品交换的协议或合同，按合同交货，既可克服盲目性，又可减少运输费，应广泛采用。
    四、过分强调行政管理，不如加强业务经营。华北合作货栈过去因住的是各下级社，强调行政管理，忽视业务经营，任务完不成，不知等几天。有的干部对客人盛气凌人，闹的意见很多。自加强代购代销后，从完成时间及价格上，叫客人作比较，业务才逐渐多起来。
    五、货栈对城乡物资交流作用很大，它是工农产品直接交换的枢纽，把分散的业务加以组织，有计划的向外推销。而其中心一环是给土产打销路，因为土产销不了，即谈不上物资交流，工农产品也没法交换。过去的几个月，我们未抓紧这一环，推销土产只占总交易额的百分之十八，土产压着推不出，影响了物资交流。到六月底止，即达到百分之五十四，因此带动了各社的业务，加速了交换。
    六、合作货栈不同于私人货栈旅馆，除加强业务的经营，好好为各社服务外，对客人要进行适当的招待、管理、教育。我们为了照顾客人的生活学习，组织职员客人消费社，供给日用品，看影戏、洗澡、理发，均有优待办法；组织客人学习、生活、检查委员会，由其自己管理自己；并设有图书室供客人阅览。我们过去只是注意了自己，忽视了住客。
    七、想把货栈搞好，“作风”是个关键，华北合作货栈五月前官僚主义作风很严重，对客人不热情，联系少，业务被动，形成“坐等业务”，“挂上幌子、开大店、愿者上钩”，每日交易额由五亿元减为二亿余元。转变作风后，每日成交上升到十二亿上下，这说明官僚主义作风对事业的危害，是相当大的。
    八、为了把货栈办好，贯彻“大家的货栈大家办”，建立了“住栈干部代表会”，住客的意见，通过代表反映出来。货栈则根据这些意见改进工作。货栈的决议由代表会讨论通过贯彻执行，每十天开会一次。代表会的组织，是各省选代表一名，货栈选出二名，另聘秘书一人，负责召集会议，整理纪录，督促问题的处理，监督决议的执行。根据这一段的经验，贯彻大家出主意，提意见，办好货栈，是一个积极有效的办法，同时对改进货栈工作，转变干部作风，亦有其一定的作用。如第一次代表会曾提出十余条对货栈的批评，而第四次会中只提出关于生活细节的三条意见。由此说明住客代表会在改进工作中的重要性。故在较大城市的货栈，住客较多，而且时间住的较长，宜采用此种办法。中、小城市货栈，住客流动性较大者，宜多开座谈会争取意见，改进工作。
    九、作好货栈工作，我们认为必须具备以下的几个基本条件，即成交迅速，价格合理，维持信用，简化手续，招待周到，殷勤和蔼。
    十、关于农民招待所的问题：
    中小城市及较大的集镇工商业发展的地区都可设立；较大的城市，虽有货栈，为了解决附近农民进城交换的困难，也可以设立。它与本市的经济关系较为密切，亦是市政建设工作的一项，应属当地市社领导。其服务对象，主要是农民，未有成立货栈者，应包括合作社。业务范围，在华北区尚无统一规定，目下也不必要作统一的规定，应根据当地实际情形及农民的要求决定，除代客买卖，招待食宿外，其他业务可酌情办理。农民招待所为农民的信托机构，为了集中力量给农民办事，最好不作自营，至于交换上的困难，可由当地社解决，委托其代理购销。
    今后尚须研究明确的问题：
    一、华北区成立货栈已近一年，因无统一的章则条例，其内容五花八门，未起到应有的作用。今后应订定统一的章则条例，以免各地新建立货栈再走弯路。
    二、代购代销在现阶段是货栈的一项重要工作，因中国经济的落后，合作经济实行全部的统一的计划经营，为时尚早，各级社有些产品，必须自己进城交换，而盲目性及无政府状态尚不可免。货栈办理代购代销，加以组织，变分散的为成批的，变盲目的为有计划的，然后有步骤的统一的向外购销，这是科学的进步的作法。但有许多社的业务员，不愿通过货栈组织起来，总愿背地自己搞，给投机者造下机会。如某专区社买农具多花了钱，还受到报纸批评。有的专区社、县社见到省社不通过货栈自己搞，他们也照办，破坏了组织业务的计划。
    另外应当把各社“派人购销”的作法，变为“来函委托”的作法，以节省开支，减少浪费干部的现象。现在每天平均住干部一七○人上下，将大批有能力的干部闲起来，甚为可惜！今后凡有基础的货栈，应逐渐开展函购函销，但上级社必须有明确规定。试看国际贸易大批成交，不是派人往来，而是通过信、报办理成交，我们可根据商品种类、规格试办。
    三、仓库业务在合作社事业中占着重要地位，它管理着合作社的全部物资，它是商品由分散到集中，由集中到分散的枢纽。过去我们重视的不够，只起到了“保存”的作用；而且没保存好，更谈不上“管理”。为了加强仓库事业的统一管理，提高管理技术，减少商品不必要的损失，各社的仓库，凡有货栈者，应归货栈统一管理经营。
