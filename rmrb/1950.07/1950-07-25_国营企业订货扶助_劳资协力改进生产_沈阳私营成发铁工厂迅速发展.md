Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd: Among the rapidly developing private machinery and iron industries in Shenyang City over the past year, the Chengfa Iron Factory is a relatively typical example. Thanks to the support of orders from state-owned enterprises, the active production of workers, and the improvement of management by the capitalists, the factory has achieved great development over the past year. The number of workers in the factory was only six in February of last year, but has now increased to 215, and the amount of capital has also increased by 279% compared to the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period. Currently, all 63 lathes in the factory are in operation, and more than 100 oil injectors can be produced each month. The output in June was equivalent to 178% of the output in December of last year. The cost per oil injector has also been reduced by 2.68 million Northeast currency compared to last year. With the development of production, the factory has rebuilt six factory buildings and built 68 new workers' dormitories, and has also established a vocational school for employees and a primary school for workers' children (currently with 40 students). In addition to drawing salaries, the capitalists (one factory director and two managers) invest all profits into production and publish the accounts to the workers every month.

When Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied Shenyang, the production of the Chengfa Iron Factory completely stopped, and the workers were forced to disband. After the liberation of Shenyang, the factory resumed work in February of last year. At first, the capitalists did not fully understand the policies of the People's Government, and the labor-management relationship was not normal, so they had little confidence in management, and only maintained production by repairing sporadic machine parts, and could not even work for ten days a month. After June of last year, with the recovery of state-owned enterprises and the improvement of labor-management relations in the factory, the capitalists gradually dispelled their concerns and actively sought work, thus enabling production to gradually develop. In July of last year, the capitalists accepted orders from Anshan Iron and Steel Company for 40 oil injectors and 15 wind pumps. According to the production efficiency at the time, it would not have been possible to complete even 40 oil injectors in two months. After five days and nights of painstaking research by workers Zhao Yingchen and Chen Yunlan, the drilling machine was transformed, increasing the production efficiency from five and a half work days per machine to one and a half work days per machine. As a result, the production task was completed five days ahead of schedule, and the product quality was good and the waste was low. From then on, the capitalists further realized that as long as they managed well, production would inevitably develop. In order to encourage employees to increase output and ensure quality, the capitalists automatically took out 30% of all profits as bonuses. The trade union also held weekly technical research meetings to discuss ways to improve production. In February of this year, the factory also established a quota system. After the establishment of this system, the output in February increased by eight oil injectors compared to January. In addition, in addition to conducting joint valuations after each undertaking, labor and management in the factory generally hold labor-management consultation meetings to discuss and resolve general production issues. Since March, such meetings have been held eight times, and agreements have been reached each time in a spirit of democracy and equality. All agreements have been realized through the joint efforts of both parties.

### 国营企业订货扶助·劳资协力改进生产  沈阳私营成发铁工厂迅速发展

　　国营企业订货扶助·劳资协力改进生产
    沈阳私营成发铁工厂迅速发展
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】在一年来发展相当迅速的沈阳市私营机械铁工业中，成发铁工厂是一个较为典型的例子。该厂由于国营企业订货扶助、工人积极生产和资方改善经营，一年来获得了很大的发展。该厂工人数去年二月仅有六名，目前已增加到二百十五名，资金数也较伪满最高时增加了百分之二百七十九。目前该厂六十三台车床已全部开动，每月可产注油器一百多台。六月份的产量已相当于去年十二月产量的百分之一百七十八。每台注油器的成本也较去年减少了东北币二百六十八万元。随着生产的发展，该厂已重建了六个厂房，新建了六十八间工人宿舍，并成立了职工业余学校和工人子弟小学（现有学生四十名）。资方（厂长一人经理二人）每月除提取薪金以外，全部利润均投入生产，并每月向工人公布账目。
    成发铁工厂在蒋匪军侵占沈阳时，生产完全停顿，工人被迫遣散。沈阳解放后，该厂即于去年二月复工。起初资方因对人民政府政策了解不够，劳资关系也不正常，因此经营信心不大，仅以修理零星机件维持生产，一个月还作不到十天的活。去年六月以后，随着国营企业的恢复和该厂劳资关系的改善，资方顾虑逐渐打消，积极揽活，因而使生产逐步走向发展。去年七月资方接受了鞍山钢铁公司四十台注油器、十五台风泵的订货。如按当时的生产效率，两个月内光四十台注油器也无法完成。经工人赵膺臣、陈云岚五昼夜的苦心钻研，改造了钻眼床，把过去五个半工钻一台的生产效率，提高到一个半工钻一台，结果使该项生产任务提前五天完成，而且产品质量好、废品少。从这以后，资方更进一步认识到只要好好经营，生产必然能够发展。为了鼓励职工提高产量、保证质量，资方自动拿出全部利润的百分之三十作为奖励金。工会也每周召开技术研究会，研讨改进生产的办法。今年二月，该厂并建立了定额制。这一制度建立后，二月份比一月份增产了八台注油器。此外，该厂劳资双方除在每次揽活后进行共同估价外，一般生产问题均举行劳资协商会议协商解决。这种会议，自三月以来已召开过八次，每次都在民主平等的精神下达成协议。各项协议且都在双方努力下见诸实现。
