　　Diligently Study Documents to Improve Party-Mass Relations
    Liu Village Branch Improves People's Representative Conference Work
    Shen Yuanze
    Due to the existence of narrow-minded, closed-door "leftist" tendencies, the Liu Village Branch in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, seriously affected unity and cooperation with non-Party masses. The branch's monopolization of the village People's Representative Conference aroused dissatisfaction among some of the masses. This was one specific manifestation of the aforementioned tendencies. In the process of correcting this tendency, the branch first conveyed the resolution of the county Party congress at the branch committee meeting, and in conjunction with conveying the resolution, studied the document "Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists Being Good at Uniting and Cooperating with Non-Party Masses" and conducted a self-examination. Branch committee member Zhang Maohai said in his self-criticism: "In the past, I didn't know that the People's Representative Conference was an important organization for uniting people from all walks of life to improve production; I only knew that the Party led everything. I always felt that no one was better than a Party member, so when electing representatives to the People's Representative Conference, I always wanted to elect more Party members. As a result, fifteen of the twenty-one representatives in the village People's Representative Conference were Party members. The remaining six were also production models, activists, and new middle peasants close to the Party." Branch Secretary He Genhai said in his self-criticism: "The rich peasant Niu Da came to the cadres several times asking for help in mediating family discord that was affecting production. I mistakenly believed that cadres shouldn't interfere in the problems of rich peasant families, so I ignored him." Similar erroneous thinking was prevalent among the nine branch committee members. After study and discussion, each branch committee member realized that this was wrong and should be corrected. Subsequently, the branch committee analyzed and studied the thinking of ordinary Party members, and believed that similar "leftist" sentiments existed, and decided to convene a branch general meeting to resolve it.
    At the branch general meeting, in light of the ideological situation of the Party members, the significance and role of the People's Representative Conference were repeatedly explained, and it was solemnly pointed out that the idea of monopolizing the People's Representative Conference was wrong and harmful to the Party's cause, not beneficial. At the same time, the "Central Committee's Instructions on Studying the Documents of Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists Being Good at Uniting and Cooperating with Non-Party Masses" and the two documents were explained and discussed in detail, which enabled all Party members to recognize their past mistakes. Zhang Donghai said: "This time I understand. Although I am the chairman of the village People's Representative Conference, I also thought that the People's Representative Conference was a deaf man's ear, not playing any role. The branch made all the decisions, and the People's Representative Conference just 'went through the motions' because fifteen of the twenty-one Party member representatives agreed with the branch's decisions, and the remaining six non-Party representatives didn't have any opinions. In the future, the People's Representative Conference should increase representatives from all walks of life, fully promote democracy, let everyone offer more opinions, and jointly decide and handle major village affairs to truly exert the role of the representative conference." Niu Luyou said: "Since the old man Liu Guoxing participated in the county People's Representative Conference last year, he has been active in his work. In the afforestation work last autumn, he played a significant role in promoting it. He also constantly offers opinions to our branch. These facts prove that as long as we can unite the masses well, it is beneficial and harmless to our work." After such a heated discussion, everyone unanimously agreed to re-elect the representatives to the People's Representative Conference, and discussed the withdrawal of some Party members and specific issues in the re-election of some People's Representative Conference representatives.
    Subsequently, the branch used various methods such as people's schools, blackboards, and broadcasting to widely publicize the spirit of the resolution of this branch general meeting. Party members used mealtime conversations and visiting to conduct individual explanation work, gradually changing some of the masses' dissatisfaction with emotions such as "the Party decides, so just 'go with the flow'," and began to pay attention to the work of the People's Representative Conference.
    When re-electing the representatives of the People's Representative Conference, on the one hand, the significance of the re-election was publicized to the masses, and on the other hand, the original People's Representative Conference was convened to review and summarize the previous stage of work, and to explain the significance of this re-election of the People's Representative Conference. During the meeting, the method of consultation with non-Party representatives was adopted to discuss how to conduct the re-election and who should be elected as representatives. At the same time, Party members led the masses in different areas and villages to discuss and deliberate on the re-election of the People's Representative Conference representatives. As a result of this election, among the twenty-one representatives, there were seven Party members, and the remaining fourteen were middle peasants, rich peasants, intellectuals in the countryside, and young women.
    At the first People's Representative Conference after the re-election, the branch put forward the 1950 production increase goals and plans. The People's Representative Conference conducted a careful discussion and made supplements and revisions, making the plan more complete. After the meeting, people from all walks of life were very satisfied. Representative Niu Manze transported fertilizer to the field three miles away from the village eight times in one morning (usually only four times). Someone asked him, "Why did you get up so early?" He said, "People take Shunqi pills because they want to be free of worries and live a good life." He also newly bought and repaired 8.6 mu of land and bought a cow. Wang Bao, a middle peasant who had been wrongly struggled against, also bought a mule. Representative Fan Xiaomao personally went to relatives in Xiangyuan to exchange good grain seeds to help the masses exchange good varieties. Fifteen households in the village newly bought and repaired 45.6 mu of land.

　　认真学习文件改善党群关系
    刘家村支部改进人民代表会议工作
    申元则
    山西省平顺县刘家村支部由于存在着狭隘的关门主义的“左”倾偏向，因此严重地影响了与非党群众的团结合作。由于支部对村人民代表会议的包办，引起了一部分群众的不满。这就是上述偏向的具体表现之一。该支部在进行纠正这一偏向时，首先在支委会传达县党代会的决议，并结合着传达决议学习了“斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作”的文件，进行了检查。支委张毛孩检讨说：“以前我就不知道人民代表会议是团结各阶层人民搞好生产的重要组织；只知道党领导一切。我总觉着什么人也没有党员好，因此在选人民代表会议代表时，总愿意多选几个党员。结果村人代会的二十一个代表中就有十五个是党员。其余六个也是接近党的生产模范、积极分子和新中农。”支部书记何根孩检讨说：“富农牛达因家庭不和影响到生产，曾几次来找干部去帮助调解。我错误地认为富农家里的问题干部是不要管的，因之就没有理会。”此类错误思想在九个支委中普遍存在。经过学习讨论后，每个支委都认识了这是错误的，应加以纠正。接着支委会对一般党员思想作了分析研究，认为同样存在着这种“左”的情绪，决定召开支部大会来解决。
    在支部大会上，针对党员思想情况，反复说明了人民代表会议的意义和作用，严正指出了这种包办人民代表会议的思想是错误的，不是有利于党的事业而是有害于党的事业的。同时把“中央关于学习斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作文件的指示”和两个文件作了详尽的讲解与讨论，这样才使全体党员认识了过去的错误。张东海说：“这回我可想通了，我虽是村人民代表会议的主席，也认为人民代表会议是聋子的耳朵，不起啥作用，什么事情都是支部作了决定，到人民代表会议上‘走走过场’，因为二十一个代表中十五个党员代表是同意支部决定的，其余六个非党代表也就没啥意见了。以后人民代表会议要增加各阶层的代表，充分发扬民主，让大家多提意见，共同来决定和办理村里的大事，真正发挥代表会的作用。”牛路有说：“刘过兴老汉，自从去年参加县各界人民代表会后，工作积极，去年秋天的造林工作中，他就起了很大的推动作用。对我们支部也不断提出意见。这些事实证明了只要我们能够很好的团结群众，对工作是有利而无害的。”经过这样热烈的讨论后，大家一致同意改选人民代表会议的代表。并讨论了部分党员的退席和一些人民代表会议改选中的具体问题等。
    接着支部把这次支部大会决议的精神利用民校、黑板报、广播等各种方式，作了广泛的宣传。党员们利用饭场谈话与串门的方式进行了个别解释工作。逐渐转变了某些群众对“党决定了就算”，只好“随风倒”等不满情绪，并开始注意人代会的工作。
    改选人民代表会议代表的时候，一面向群众宣传改选的意义，一面召开原来的人民代表会议检查总结前段工作，说明这次人民代表会议改选的意义。会议中采取和非党代表协商的办法，讨论如何进行改选，应该选举那些人当代表。同时通过党员分片分庄领导群众讨论酝酿人民代表会议代表的改选问题。此次选举结果，二十一个代表中，有党员七人，其余十四人是中农、富农、在乡知识分子及青年妇女等。
    在改选后的第一次人民代表会议上，支部提出了一九五○年增产奋斗目标与计划。人代会作了审慎的讨论，加以补充与修改，使这个计划变得更完整了。会后各阶层人民非常满意。代表牛满则一个早上就往离村三里远的地里送肥八趟（平常只能送四趟）。有人问他“为啥起得那样早”，他说：“人吃的是顺气丸，只要心里没事，过好光景谁不愿意。”他又新买、新修土地八亩六分，买牛一头。错斗了的中农王保也买骡子一头，代表范小毛为帮助群众调换优良品种，亲自到襄垣亲戚家去换好谷种。全村就有十五户新买新修地四十五亩六分。
