　　Inadequate Protection of Cultural Relics and Historical Sites
　　Letter of Self-Criticism from the Luoyang Bureau of Culture and Education

　　To the Editorial Comrades:

　　The criticism made by Mr. Emei in the People's Forum on June 29 regarding our inadequate protection of cultural relics and historical sites has prompted us to pay further attention to this work.

　　In the past, due to our lack of study of the government's policy on protecting cultural relics and historical sites, we treated many relics and historical sites with historical and academic value as broken stones and rubble, either allowing them to be "scattered everywhere" or neglecting valuable stone carvings, treating them as "stone steps" without concern. This also shows our lack of knowledge of China's historical heritage.

　　Now, in addition to sorting out the existing scattered steles, statues, ancient artifacts, etc., we are also studying the "Provisional Measures for the Protection and Excavation of Antiquities" promulgated by the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, so as to prevent such antiquities from being destroyed and lost in the future.

### 保护文物古迹不力   洛阳文教局来信检讨

　　保护文物古迹不力
    洛阳文教局来信检讨编辑同志：
    六月二十九日人民园地刊载峨嵋先生对我们保护文物古迹不力的批评，已引起我们对这项工作进一步的注意。
    过去因为我们对政府保护文物古迹的政策缺乏研究，所以把许多具有历史学术价值的文物古迹当作破石乱瓦，不是任其“到处星散”，就是将贵重之刻石当成“石阶”不加过问。这也说明我们对中国历史遗产的缺乏知识。
    现在我们除已将现存之散乱碑石、造像、古器等加以整理外，并正研究实施中南军政委员会颁发之“古物保护及发掘暂行办法”，俾使今后此类古物不被破坏与散失。
