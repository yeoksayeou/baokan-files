　　Introduction to Busan, Mokpo, and Hallasan
    Answering Comrade Zhu Zhiqizhi

Editor Comrade:

    In his broadcast to all the Korean military and civilians on July 13th, General Kim Il-sung said: "We must plant the glorious flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Busan, Mokpo, and Hallasan on Jeju Island, and end our just war of liberation with victory." I do not know the geographical situation of the three cities of Busan, Mokpo, and Hallasan. Please provide a brief introduction.
                                  Zhu Zhiqizhi

Zhiqizhi Comrade:

    Busan is located at the mouth of the Nakdong River in southeastern Korea and is a good port. The harbor is wide and deep, and can accommodate warships. Busan faces Tsushima Island across the Korea Strait to the east and is the main seaport and gateway to southern Korea, with railways to Seoul. Land and water transportation are extremely convenient. During the Japanese occupation, Busan was Korea's foreign trade market, mainly exporting rice, raw silk, tussah silk, seafood, cattle, and sheep. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, American imperialism built an airport here, stationed troops, and helped the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang suppress the people's revolutionary movement. Now, the U.S. imperialists are using the area as an ammunition supply station for the American invading forces.

    Mokpo belongs to Jeolla Namdo and is located at the mouth of the drowned bay of the Yeongsan River. The harbor is good, commerce is developed, and aquatic and agricultural products are abundant, making it one of the largest fish markets in Korea and an export site of rice, grains, and cotton in Jeolla Namdo. The land and water transportation in this area are very convenient, making it known as the southwestern gateway of Korea.

    Hallasan is located in the center of Jeju Island and is one of the three highest peaks in Korea, about 1,950 meters high. The people's guerrilla force of Jeju Island controls Hallasan and uses the mountainous area as a base to carry out armed struggle against the Li Chengwan bandit gang's "punitive expedition teams."

    Busan, Mokpo, and Hallasan are all territories of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and important national defense locations in the south. The Korean People's Army is fighting for the independence, freedom, and unification of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and planting the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea over Busan, Mokpo, and on the peaks of Hallasan signifies the liberation of all Korean territory.

　　釜山、木浦、汉拿山介绍
    答朱之其同志问编者同志：
    金日成将军在七月十三日向全朝鲜军民的广播中说：“要把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国荣誉的旗帜插到釜山、木浦、济州岛的汉拿山，要以胜利来结束我们正义的解放战争。”我不知道釜山、木浦、汉拿山三城市的地理情况，请作简要介绍。
                                  朱之其之其同志：
    釜山位于朝鲜东南部的洛东江口，是一个良港。该港湾广水深，可泊军舰。釜山东隔朝鲜海峡与对马岛遥遥相对，是朝鲜南部的主要海港和门户，有铁路通达汉城。水陆交通，均极便利。在日寇统治时代，釜山是朝鲜的对外贸易市场，输出品以米、生丝、柞蚕丝、海产物、牛羊等为主。日寇投降后，美帝国主义在这里修筑飞机场，驻扎军队，帮助李承晚匪帮镇压人民革命运动。现在，美帝又利用该地作为美国侵略军的军火供应站。
    木浦属于全罗南道，地当荣山江口的溺没湾的湾口。港湾良好，商业发达，水产、农产物丰富，为朝鲜最大鱼市之一，是全罗南道米、谷棉花的输出地。该地水陆交通都很方便，称为朝鲜的西南门户。
    汉拿山在济州岛的中央，为朝鲜三大高峰之一，高约一千九百五十公尺。济州岛的人民游击队控制着汉拿山，并以山区为根据地，与李承晚匪帮的“讨伐队”进行着武装斗争。
    釜山、木浦、汉拿山都是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领土和南部国防要地。朝鲜人民军正在为实现朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立、自由与统一而战斗，把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗插到釜山、木浦的上空和汉拿山的高峰上，即表示全部朝鲜领土的解放。
