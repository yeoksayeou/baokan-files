Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 29th: The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued two orders on the 26th. The first order grants the honorary title of "Guards Unit" to the 105th Tank Division of Seoul, the 3rd Division of Seoul, and the 18th Regiment (Corps) because they demonstrated bravery in the just war for the unification, freedom, and independence of the fatherland and against the armed aggression of US imperialism, inflicting significant blows on the enemy, liberating a large number of cities and villages, and occupying many enemy military facilities and transportation hubs, establishing special merits in ensuring the overall victory of the frontline troops.

The second order stipulates that the title of "Hero of the Republic," the First Class National Flag Medal, and a Gold Star Medal shall be awarded to Kim Si-jeong, a sergeant of the Korean People's Army, who demonstrated bravery in the war and established heroic achievements.

Sergeant Kim Si-jeong stood at the forefront of his unit in every battle to crush the surprise attack launched by the Syngman Rhee puppet army at dawn on June 25th, break through the 38th parallel, and liberate Seoul. On June 29th, the day after the liberation of Seoul, he and Sergeant Kim Il-seop received orders to lead all the soldiers of their company to cross the Han River and pursue the enemy who had fled from Seoul across the river, setting up artillery positions on the highlands south of the river. With the Han River railway bridge destroyed and the enemy's artillery fire concentrated, Sergeant Kim Si-jeong found a small boat that could only hold ten people and braved the intense artillery fire to shuttle back and forth across the river, transporting all the soldiers of his company across. Kim Si-jeong's selfless and heroic actions ensured that his company crossed the Han River and seized the enemy's artillery positions on the high ground on the other side, thereby creating conditions for the smooth crossing of the main force.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 29th: The Military Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has recently issued a decision on the formulation of badges for war wounded. The decision states: In order to give a symbol of honor to the soldiers of the People's Army who were wounded in the just war for the unification, freedom, and independence of the fatherland, the Military Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has decided to award badges for war wounded. War wounded badges are divided into two types: red and yellow. Red badges are awarded to the seriously wounded, and yellow badges are awarded to the lightly wounded. The right to award the badges belongs to the Minister of National Defense.
