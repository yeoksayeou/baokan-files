　　Attempting to Cover Up the Truth of the Criminal War
    Malayan Authorities Enact Fascist News Regulations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] In order to cover up the truth about the imperialist bloc's aggression in Korea and the criminal war being waged in Malaya, the British colonial authorities in Malaya issued fascist regulations on the 20th to close down newspapers and publications. According to Agence France-Presse: the regulations stipulate that the British colonial governments of Malaya and Singapore have the right to close down newspapers and publications that may "incite opposition to the United Nations' actions in Korea" and are "detrimental to the smooth suppression of 'terrorists'". According to Reuters: publishers, printers and distributors of newspapers and publications deemed "illegal" may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years and fines of up to one thousand Straits dollars. Possessing the newspapers will also be punished with six months' imprisonment.
