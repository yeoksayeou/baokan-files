　　提高警惕，预防霍乱！
    市卫生委员会决定预防办法
    【京市新闻处讯】京市卫生委员会于十九日下午三时在市人民政府召开了扩大卫生会议，商讨预防霍乱办法。有中央人民政府卫生部、军委卫生部、中共北京市委会、市总工会、市府各局处等二十四个单位参加。中央卫生部防疫处李志中处长报告了天津市发生霍乱的经过，并指出目前是霍乱最易流行的时候，希望各有关单位提高警惕，发动群众及早预防。市公共卫生局严镜清局长指出霍乱是肠胃传染病中最严重的一种，病菌是从口里传入的，所以应该针对饮食物清洁、自来水井水消毒等项工作着手进行预防。市卫生委员会已加强霍乱预防注射和整理环境卫生，拟定的预防霍乱紧急措施办法纲要曾在会上作了研究讨论，将根据会上意见加以整理后，公布实行。本市如有疑似霍乱病例发生时，市民应立即报告附近卫生所，或迳往传染病医院（三区大佛寺街十一号）查验诊治。
