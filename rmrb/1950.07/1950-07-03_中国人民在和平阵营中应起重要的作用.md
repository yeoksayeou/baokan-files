　　The Chinese People Should Play an Important Role in the Peace Camp
    Saifuding
    Today's era is an era in which the majority of the world's people are fighting against world war and for lasting world peace, in order to strike at the aggression attempts of the warmongers.
    The great revolutionary victory of the Chinese people has brought the peace and democracy forces in Asia and the entire world to a new stage. But this is not enough. For the sake of the permanent peace of our motherland and the whole world, we Chinese people should work even harder in the struggle against the war instigators—imperialism.
    The Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, should play an important role in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Our leader and mentor, Chairman Mao, has educated us in this way.

　　中国人民在和平阵营中应起重要的作用
    赛福鼎
    今日的时代，是世界大多数人民为反对世界战争，为争取世界持久和平而斗争，以打击战争贩子们的侵略企图的时代。
    中国人民的伟大革命胜利，已使亚洲及整个世界的和平民主力量，走上了一个新的阶段。但是这还不够，我们中国人民为了祖国和全世界的永久和平，应更加努力于反对战争挑拨者——帝国主义的斗争。
    占全世界人口四分之一的中国人民，在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中，应起重要的作用。
    我们的领袖和导师毛主席是这样教育了我们的。
