　　The United States Wants to Expand Rumor-Mongering
    Truman Asks Congress to Increase Funding
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from New York via TASS] Newspaper reports state: Truman has requested an additional appropriation of $89 million from Congress for propaganda expenses. In his message to Congress, Truman pointed out that the additional appropriation for propaganda purposes would be mainly used to expand the broadcasting of "Voice of America." Truman was forced to admit in a disguised manner that the broad masses of people in foreign countries, especially in Western Europe, do not believe American propaganda. In agitating for the expansion of American propaganda, Truman said that all the achievements the United States has obtained in Western Europe may be reduced to zero. Truman naturally remained silent on the gradual loss of trust in the propaganda systematically disseminated by American newspapers and radio stations in the United States. He also naturally did not mention the fact that the American ruling clique is trying its best to conceal the truth from the people. As is well known, as a result of a secret understanding between the government and the monopoly capitalists who manufacture radio equipment, shortwave radios for sale to the general public have not been manufactured in the United States for two years. This was done out of fear that Americans would learn the truth from foreign broadcasts, especially from the Soviet Union.

　　美国要扩大造谣
    杜鲁门请国会增拨经费
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：据报纸消息：杜鲁门已经请求国会额外拨款八千九百万元，作为宣传费用。杜鲁门在他致国会的咨文中指出：作为宣传用途的额外拨款，主要用在扩充“美国之音”的广播上。杜鲁门被迫用掩饰的方式承认外国特别是西欧的广大群众都不相信美国的宣传。在鼓动扩大美国的宣传时，杜鲁门说美国在西欧获得的一切成就都可能等于零了。杜鲁门对美国报纸和广播上有计划地散布的宣传在美国之逐渐失去信任，自然是保持缄默的。他自然也不说到美国统治集团尽力向人民掩饰真相的事。如所周知，作为政府和制造无线电设备的独占资本家之间的秘密谅解的结果，两年以来，在美国已经不制造卖给一般公众的短波收音机了。这样作法是由于害怕美国人从外国特别从苏联的广播中知道了事实的真相。
