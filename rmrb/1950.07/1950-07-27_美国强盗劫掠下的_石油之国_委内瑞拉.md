　　The "Oil Country" Under the Plunder of American Robbers - Venezuela
    Qiu He
    Venezuela, with a terrain similar to Sichuan in our country, an area approximately two and a half times that of Sichuan, and a population less than one-ninth of Sichuan, possesses abundant resources. Besides its world-renowned oil, it also has coffee, cocoa, fish, livestock, forests, sugarcane, cotton, rubber, coal, salt, natural asphalt, and other natural resources – iron, gold, tin, copper, manganese, diamonds, and mica, etc. These resources are being plundered by American monopoly capital.
    Venezuela's oil reserves amount to over ten billion tons. Its current annual production is about seventy million tons, second only to the United States, while its export volume is the highest in the world. The country's oil fields are spread along the Caribbean coast in the northwest and the eastern region, but the main oil fields are in the state of Zulia in the west. There, the average daily output per well exceeds thirty tons (about fifteen times that of the United States), and the famous Lake Maracaibo is even covered with thick oil.
    Despite the abundance of oil reserves and production, not a single ton is controlled by the Venezuelan people. Creole Petroleum Corporation (a branch of Standard Oil), Mene Grande Oil Company (a branch of Gulf Oil), and Royal Dutch Shell (a British-Dutch joint venture) monopolize Venezuela's oil production, with Creole Corporation controlling over 75% of all oil. According to official statistics, more than one-tenth of Venezuela's total land area (about seven million hectares) has become the private property of American oil-sucking ghosts. American capital enjoys all kinds of privileges, while Venezuelan capital can only sigh at the sight of oil. Currently, the total American oil investment in Venezuela, according to the "South American Weekly," is two billion US dollars.
    The means of exploitation used by American bloodsuckers against the Venezuelan people are extremely brutal. In addition to the direct exploitation of oil workers, they disregard the provision in the oil concession contracts stating that "the Venezuelan government has the right to receive one-sixth of the oil production, either in oil or cash," and force the Venezuelan government to accept cash. This makes their "monopoly" even more thorough. In 1946, Venezuela's oil production was 56.7 million tons, and the oil field usage tax paid by the oil monopoly capitalists was 83.6 million US dollars, which means the Venezuelan government only received a commission of 1.5 US dollars per ton. However, at that time, the United States sold it to other countries at a monopoly price of more than 20 US dollars per ton, and the staggering amount of excess profit rolled into the pockets of American oil bosses. From 1948 to early 1949, due to the surge in oil production, the oil merchants were even more profitable. Encouraged by the so-called "foreign investment policy" of the Venezuelan rulers, approximately 300 million US dollars of new investment was poured in.
    However, the insatiable greed of imperialism can never be filled. Venezuela's iron ore has met the same fate as oil. The iron ore deposits in the lower Orinoco River in Venezuela are extremely rich, with the reserves at the Cerro Bolívar mine alone reaching over 60 million tons, and its high quality (iron content of 70%) is unmatched in the world. America's two major steel cartels—Bethlehem Steel and Oliver Iron Mining Company—have begun to plunder. They plan to invest 400 million US dollars successively in the development of Venezuelan iron ore mines. They have already mined 300 million square feet of area, and it is said that large quantities of iron ore may be shipped to the United States this year.
    At the same time, American merchants, who almost completely control the gold placer concessions in Venezuela, are also "panning" for "gold" in the tributaries of the Orinoco River.
    In addition, it is worth noting that as soon as the war ended, countless American "exploration teams" searched throughout Venezuela for uranium and other "atomic bomb" raw materials. According to an American newspaper, "The exploration results are not bad." Naturally, many other rare metal and non-metal treasures are also constantly being "enthusiastically" and "freely explored."
    In the entire economic system, oil has swallowed all other sectors. This is the most important move in Wall Street's entire plan to turn Venezuela into an American colony. Venezuelan industry is oppressed by the competition of American goods and cannot develop. Its pitiful light industry, such as textiles, soap, cement, etc., is confined to the corner of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, and they cannot compete with American goods. Currently, Caracas has become a genuine American market. American-made clothing fills the stores, and American beverage trademarks are everywhere. McCormick & Company controls all meat, canned goods, tea, tobacco, spices, etc.; and American hardware stores monopolize the entire hardware industry. Due to the American monopoly capital's control over Venezuela's import and export trade (controlling about 90%), the blood and sweat of the Venezuelan working people are continuously flowing into Wall Street's safes.
    The criminal rule of oil capital has also stifled Venezuelan agriculture. Most farmers have abandoned their land and flocked to the oil fields, not because oil field wages are high, but because farmers' lives are even harder. Of Venezuela's approximately 70 million hectares of arable land, only one-ninth is used for cultivation today, and countless fertile lands are left barren. In recent years, Venezuela's agricultural production has deteriorated. It is estimated that 94% of the domestic vegetable supply, 80% of the wheat, rice, and corn supply, and more than half of the bean consumption rely on imports from the United States and Argentina, an increase of more than tenfold compared to the past decade. In addition, Venezuela used to be a famous livestock country, with more than 10 million head of cattle at the end of the 19th century. However, due to the rise and development of the oil industry since 1918, the livestock industry has gradually been on the verge of bankruptcy. Currently, the total number of cattle and sheep in the country is only 4 million head, and even meat has to rely on imports from the United States and Argentina.
    At the same time, American monopoly capital has also carried out more direct plunder of Venezuela's agricultural products. For example, coffee and cocoa are Venezuela's main export items after oil. Their production used to be among the best in Latin America, and their delicious taste is famous worldwide. However, due to American control, their production has been declining. Because all issues related to the price and market of coffee and cocoa must be determined by the "Pan-American Coffee Bureau," established by the United States, which neither produces coffee nor exports cocoa, during the war, Venezuela's entire coffee and cocoa production and sales are easily controlled and purchased by American capitalists, who sell it to other countries at monopoly prices.
    A few years ago, Nelson Rockefeller, the American financial magnate who served as the coordinator of the Pan-American Affairs Bureau and the boss of the International Basic Economy Corporation, organized a so-called American-Venezuelan "joint venture" agricultural company in Venezuela. However, the fact is that Rockefeller's capital (16.5 million US dollars) overwhelmed everything. It not only controls the production of Venezuelan agricultural products, but also controls their processing, packaging, and sales. It includes four institutions: the Agricultural Livestock Company—covering more than 13,000 hectares, the Anronima Fisheries Company, the Dairy Company—which has established branches in major cities—and a company specializing in processing, storing, selling, and importing agricultural products. These companies have turned Venezuela into an American farm.
    According to the People's Forum (organ of the Communist Party of Venezuela), "Rockefeller's fishing company buys fish at a price of 2.25 bolivars (Venezuelan currency) per kilogram, and then sells it to the Venezuelan people, whose main dish is fish, at a monopoly price of 9.25 bolivars per kilogram." (Venezuela is one of the three major fishing grounds in South America, and the average fish consumption per capita in the country is the highest in South America.) This shows the essence of the so-called "help" and "cooperation" that monopoly capitalists often like to shout about.
    In less than half a century of criminal aggression, Wall Street has turned Venezuela into its colony.
    The high prices and low living standards of the people are the biggest characteristics here: the high prices are unmatched in the world. It is estimated that the prices in Caracas are four times higher than those in Chile, which has a relatively high standard of living in South America; more than three times higher than those in luxurious Paris, and more than twice as high as those in extravagant New York. For example, a pair of American leather shoes here sells for about 16 US dollars, a bar of soap costs 80 cents, and a chicken costs about 3 US dollars each. However, the income of the working people is extremely meager. For example, an agricultural worker's daily wage is about 30 US cents—the price of two bunches of bananas, but his family's expenses all depend on this income. As for oil workers, although their wages are slightly higher, they can never catch up with the sky-high prices, and their life and death are still in the hands of the oil devils. Especially in the recent year, due to the oil well closures and oil production cuts caused by the development of the American economic crisis, the lives of workers are even more precarious. For example, last year, the American devils in the western oil areas laid off thousands of workers for no reason, and they even threatened to lay off about 15,000 workers.
    Venezuela's housing shortage is also extremely serious. According to official statistics, 67% of the houses in the country are wooden sheds or thatched huts. According to an official report in 1947, more than 60,000 of the 300,000 residents in Caracas need to have their houses repaired before they can live in them for a long time. However, in sharp contrast, the towering and dazzling Avila Hotel and Silencio Building, inhabited by a small group of parasites!
    However, there are even stranger things. For example, residents in the suburbs of major cities cannot afford oil, but they live in a country with "lakes of oil"! Also, children on the streets will look at the chocolates given to them by Soviet journalists visiting there with dreamy eyes, but Venezuela is the world's largest supplier of chocolate raw materials!
    Poverty is accompanied by disease. Venezuela has a very high average mortality rate and extremely poor national physique. For example, in a certain conscription before the war, 95% of those who failed the physical examination. According to official statistics last year, the number of people in Venezuela suffering from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and malaria alone was as high as 260,000.
    Wall Street, which controls the Venezuelan economy, is also directing the country's political farce. Between 1945 and 1949 alone, there were 15 conspiracies and three changes of cabinet, two of which were overthrown by force. Whether peaceful change or violent overthrow, all follow the dictates of the United States.
    In fact, American oil capital has become the de facto emperor of Venezuela, and whether or not it serves the interests of Wall Street thoroughly is the only key to determining the president's stay. The downfall of President Medina in 1945 was nothing more than because he slightly violated the interests of the American oil emperor. After the Democratic Action Party, representing the middle class, came to power, it tried its best to maintain the original state of the oil contract. However, in 1948, the government inadvertently planned to formulate a law that slightly restricted oil interests; before Congress had even debated this law, a "revolution" occurred. As a result, President Gallegos, who was a novelist, fled to Cuba. The interim government was composed of three soldiers. After the new president came to power, he hurriedly announced to the oil masters: "Respect the oil contract." Then, he dissolved the Congress, implemented military control, banned countless trade unions, arrested more than 2,000 progressives, and adopted the basic provisions of the reactionary constitution of 1936: women and illiterates (and illiterates accounted for 62% of the total population) have no right to vote. And, interestingly, the president also gratefully presented a medal to the American military attache—Colonel Adams, the planner and commander-in-chief of this coup.
    Later, President Chalbaud repeatedly assured the American masters: "Decided to ban 'slackers'!" And his Minister of Economy, Ergana, constantly shouted: "Welcome American investment!"
    However, the American imperialists and their running dogs underestimated the growing struggle of the Venezuelan people to defend their national interests and oppose American monopoly capital, and their iron will to strive for peace and democracy.
    In 1948, the Democratic Peace Committee, headed by General Gabaldón, was established in Caracas. Members included countless famous writers, famous lawyers, and other social leaders. The committee's activities spread throughout the country, and branches were established in major and medium-sized cities, gaining the support of the broad masses of the people.
    Under the insane destruction of the reactionary authorities, Venezuela's progressive trade unions have unswervingly struggled to defend the interests of the working class. In early 1945, all the oil union organizations in the west merged to form a powerful trade union alliance to fight against the sabotage conspiracy of the reactionary Pan-American Labor Federation established by the American Federation of Labor among the Venezuelan working class. Currently, although strikes are being brutally suppressed, they are breaking out more and more frequently and extensively. In the small state of Carabobo alone, there were 645 labor-capital conflict incidents from November 1948 to March 1949, and in a major cotton strike this March (demanding wage increases and resisting American cotton), nearly 40,000 cotton workers joined the struggle.
    In the struggle to win democracy and protect the interests of the broad masses of the working people, the Communist Party of Venezuela has always appeared in a firm posture. The successful conclusion of the 1946 party rectification movement and the Second Unified Congress in 1948 marked a glorious victory for party unity and solidarity, and greatly increased the party's prestige and credibility among the broad masses. Through the party's organ publication—"People's Forum," the Communist Party of Venezuela resolutely put forward the slogans of implementing land reform, establishing a national oil industry, and improving the living conditions of the working people, and is fighting for the establishment of a national democratic united front against domestic reactionaries and foreign aggressors to strive for Venezuela's independence and freedom.
    However, under the instigation of American imperialism, the ruling class of Venezuela launched a shameful offensive against the people's forces. The People's Forum has been forced to suspend publication several times in the past year, and the newspaper was closed down this January. The Venezuelan government also openly declared the Communist Party of Venezuela illegal on May 13. Currently, great terror has already begun: more than 50 central organizations of the Communist Party of Venezuela have been closed down; the outstanding trade union leader Martín Ramírez has been arrested and imprisoned; and the leader of the oil workers, Farini, has also been detained. The Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Venezuela, Machado, and other leaders of the Communist Party of Venezuela have been forced to go underground. However, the struggle will continue, and the final defeat will inevitably be the American imperialists and the reactionary traitorous rulers of Venezuela, not the Venezuelan people.

　　美国强盗劫掠下的“石油之国”——委内瑞拉
    秋禾
    地形和我国的四川相似，面积约为四川之两倍半，而人口不足四川九分之一的委内瑞拉，有着丰富的资源。这里除掉举世闻名的石油外，还有咖啡、可可、鱼类、牲畜、森林、蔗糖、棉花、橡胶、煤、盐、土沥青以及其他天然资源——铁、金、锡、铜、锰、金钢钻和云母等等。这些资源为美国独占资本所劫掠。
    委内瑞拉的石油储量达十亿吨以上。目前年产约七千万吨，仅次于美国，而输出额之多则居世界第一。该国油田遍布于西北部加勒比海沿岸和东部地区，但主要的油田是在西部的苏里亚州一带。那儿，每井的平均日产量超过三十吨（约为美国的十五倍），而有名的马拉开波湖甚至为浓厚的石油所覆被。
    尽管石油的蕴藏和产量是如此丰富，然而却没有一吨掌握在委国人民手中。克列俄石油公司（美孚公司分支），梅尼格兰得石油公司（海湾公司分支）和皇家荷兰壳牌公司（英荷合股）垄断了委内瑞拉的石油生产，而其中克列俄公司竟掌握了全部石油的百分之七十五以上。据官方统计，委内瑞拉全部土地的十分之一以上的面积（约七百万公顷）已变成了美国吸油鬼的私产，美国资本享受着种种特权，委国资本望油兴叹。目前美国在委的石油总投资，据“南美周报”统计，为二十亿美元。
    美国吸血虫对委内瑞拉人民的剥削手段是极端横暴的。除掉了对石油工人的直接剥削外，他还不顾石油让与合同上所载明的“委政府有权取得油产之六分之一，石油或现金听便”的规定，强迫委国政府接受现金。这样就使得他“垄断”得更为彻底。一九四六年委国石油产量五千六百七十万吨，石油独占资本家所付出的油田使用税是现金八千三百六十万美元，换言之即委政府每吨只取得一元五角的佣金。然而，当时美国是以每吨二十余美元的垄断价格向其他国家卖出的，于是数量惊人的超额利润便滚进了美国石油老板的口袋里。一九四八年至一九四九年初，由于油产激增结果，石油商更是有利可图，再加以委国统治者之所谓“外资政策”的鼓励，于是三亿左右美元的新投资又投进去了。
    然而，帝国主义饕餮的欲壑是永远填不满的。委国的铁矿亦和石油遭遇了同一的命运。委国俄伦罗河下游之铁矿极丰，单是巴俄铁矿一处储量即达六千万吨之多，而其品质之高（含铁量为百分之七十）则又举世罕有其匹。美国的两大钢铁康采恩—伯利恒公司和奥立佛公司开始来搜刮了。它们打算陆续以四亿美元投在委国铁矿的开发上。目前它们已开采了三亿平方英尺的面积，据云本年内即可能有大宗铁运往美国。
    同时，几乎完全掌握着委国的砂金让与权的美国商人，也正在俄伦罗河的支流中大“淘”其“金”。
    此外，更值得注意的是，大战刚一结束，无数的美国“勘查队”即在委国全境遍查铀及他种“原子弹”原料。据美国的一家报纸透露：“堪查结果成绩不坏”。自然，还有许许多多的稀有金属和非金属宝藏也在不断地被“热心者”“免费勘查”着。
    在整个经济体系中，石油吞噬了其他的一切部门。这是华尔街使委国沦为美国殖民地的整个计划之最主要的一着。委国之工业是被美国货物竞争所压迫，而不能发展。它的可怜的一点轻工业如纺织、肥皂、洋灰等，被局限在委京加勒加斯一隅之地，而它们又无法与美货相竞争。目前，加勒加斯已成了一个地道的美国市场。美制衣物充斥店肆，美国饮料商标触目皆是。麦康米克公司承包着全部肉食、罐头、茶、烟、香料等等的生意；而美国五金行更垄断着整个五金业。由于美国独占资本对委国进出口贸易之控制（约控制了百分之九十左右），委国劳动人民的血汗所得便源源地汇流入华尔街保险箱中了。
    石油资本的罪恶统治，同时也窒息了委国的农业。农民大都抛弃了土地奔向油田，不是油田工资高，而是农民生活更苦。委国七千万公顷左右的可耕地中，今天用于耕作的不过九分之一而已，无数沃壤都荒废着。近年委国的农业生产每况愈下，据估计国内蔬菜供应的百分之九十四，麦、米、玉蜀黍供应的百分之八十以及豆类消耗的半数以上均赖美国和阿根廷输入，这各项输入较过去十年来增加十倍以上。以外，委内瑞拉过去是有名的大畜牧国，在十九世纪末叶有牛一千多万头。但由于一九一八年以来石油事业之兴起和发展，使得牧畜事业逐渐濒于破产。目前全国的牛羊总计不过四百万头，因之，连肉类同样也不得不依靠着从美国、阿根廷两国输入了。
    同时，美国独占资本对委国的农产品还进行了更为直接的掠夺。例如，咖啡和可可为委国仅次于石油之主要出口项目，它们的产量，过去在拉丁美洲是名列前茅，而其味之美，则驰名全球。但是由于美国之控制，它们的产量业已日趋下落了。因为凡是一切有关咖啡和可可的价格及市场等问题，都必须取决于战时由一个既不生产咖啡又无可可出产的美国所设的“泛美咖啡局”，所以委国的全部咖啡和可可的产销便这样轻易地由美国资本家来控制收购，由它以垄断价格向其他国家出售。
    前几年，任泛美事务局的调节员和国际基本经济公司的老板的美国财阀纳尔逊·洛克菲勒在委内瑞拉组织了所谓美委“合资经营”的农业公司。然而事实是洛克菲勒的资本（一千六百五十万美元）压倒了一切。它不仅控制着委国农产品的生产，同时也控制着它们的加工、包装和销售。它包括四个机构：农业牲畜公司——占地一万三千多公顷，安龙尼玛渔业以司，制奶公司——该公司已在各主要城市设立分厂——以及一个专门包办农产品的加工、储藏、销售和入口的公司。这些公司把委内瑞拉变成了美国的农场。
    据人民论坛报（委共机关报）称：“洛克菲勒的渔业公司以二点二五波利华（委币）一公斤的价格收鱼，然后再以每公斤九点二五波利华的垄断价格向以鱼为主菜的委国人民售出。”（委国为南美三大渔场之一，该国每一人口之平均食鱼量为南美第一。）由此可见，独占资本家们经常喜欢嚷叫的所谓“帮助”和“合作”的本质便是这样。
    在不足半世纪的罪恶侵略中，华尔街已把委内瑞拉变成了它的殖民地了。
    物价之高和人民生活水准之低为这儿的最大特色：物价之高举世罕匹，据估计委京之物价较南美生活程度颇高之智利的物价要高出四倍；较奢侈的巴黎要高出三倍多，而较之浮华透顶的纽约之物价尚要高出二倍以上。例如，这儿美国皮鞋一双约售十六美元，肥皂一块美金八毛，鸡每只约美金三元。然而劳动人民的收入却是极端菲薄的。例如，一个农业工人每日的工资约美金三毛——两串香蕉的价钱，但是他的全家开销都要靠这点收入。至于石油工人的工资虽然稍高一点，但也永远追不上高入云霄的物价，而且他们的生死簿还操在石油阎王手里。尤其最近一年来由于美国经济危机发展所引起的油厂倒闭和石油减产，使工人的生活更是朝不保夕。例如去年西部油区的美国阎王们无故解雇了数千工人而他们尚扬言将解雇一万五千左右的工人。
    委国的房荒情形也极为严重，据官方统计全国之住屋中有百分之六十七是木棚或茅屋。又据一九四七年的官方报告，委京的三十万住民中，六万人以上的住屋须经重修始能长时住人。但是，与此成为鲜明对照的是居住着一小撮寄生虫的亚维那大旅馆和西冷西沃大厦的高插入云和辉煌耀眼！
    然而，更奇怪的事情还多着呢。例如，各大城市郊区的住民都买不起石油，而他们却生活在一个“石油成湖”的国度里！又如大街上的孩童们会以梦幻的眼光惊视着到那里游历的苏联记者们所给予他们的巧克力，然而委内瑞拉却是世界上最大的巧克力原料供应国！
    与贫困俱来的是疾病。委国人口的平均死亡率极高，国民体格极差。如战前某次征兵，体格检查不及格者占百分之九十五。又据去年官方统计，是年委国单是患肺痨、肺炎、疟疾等传染病的人口即有二十六万之多。
    控制着委内瑞拉经济的华尔街，同时也导演着委国的政治丑剧。仅在战后由一九四五年至一九四九年间便发现了十五次阴谋，更换了三次内阁，其中两次系用暴力把内阁推翻的。不论和平更迭，或暴力推翻，都是奉行着美国的圣旨。
    事实上，美国的石油资本，已成了委国的太上皇，而为华尔街的利益服务得彻底与否则是决定总统去留的唯一关键。一九四五年麦丁那总统的下台无非是因为他略为触犯了美国石油太上皇的利益。代表中产阶级的民主行动党上台后，竭力维持石油合同之原状。但在一九四八年该政府偶一不慎，打算制定一条稍微限制石油利益的法案；国会对此尚未过行辩论，“革命”便发生了。于是由小说家出身的加勒戈斯总统便逃亡古巴。临时政府由三个军人组成。新总统上台后，便慌忙向石油主子们宣布：“尊重石油合同”。接着，他解散了国会，实行了军事管制，取缔了无数职工会，逮捕了二千多名进步分子，采行了一九三六年的反动宪法的基本条款：妇女和文盲（而文盲占总人口的百分之六十二）无选举权。并且，有趣的是，总统还感激地送了那位美国武官——这次政变的策划人和总指挥——阿丹姆斯上校一个勋章。
    后来，查尔包德总统又一再向美国主子保证：“决定取缔‘怠工者’！”而他的经济部长厄甘拿则不断地嚷叫：“欢迎美国投资！”
    然而，美帝及其走狗们却低估了委国人民为捍卫民族利益、反对美国独占资本的与日俱增的斗争力量，和他们争取和平民主的钢铁意志。
    一九四八年委京成立了以加巴东将军为首的民主和平委员会。会员包括无数的名作家、名律师和其他社会领袖等。该会之活动遍及全国，各大中城市都成立了分会，得到了广大人民的拥护和支持。
    委国的进步工会在反动当局的疯狂摧残下，始终不渝地为保卫工人阶级的利益而奋斗。一九四五年初，所有西部的一切石油工会组织合并成立一个强大的职工联盟，对美国劳联所建立的反动的泛美劳联在委国工人阶级中的破坏阴谋，进行斗争。目前，罢工虽被残酷地镇压着，但罢工却是日益频繁和扩大地爆发着。单只是在卡拉波波小小的一州由一九四八年十一月至一九四九年三月劳资冲突的事件就有六百四十五次之多，而今年三月的一次棉业大罢工（要求增加工资和抵制美棉），近四万的棉花工人加入了斗争。
    在争取民主和保护广大劳动人民的利益的斗争中，委国共产党始终以坚强的姿态出现着。一九四六年的清党运动和一九四八年的第二届统一大会的顺利结束，标志党内统一和团结的辉煌胜利，并且大大地增高了党在广大群众中的声势和威信。通过了党的机关刊物——“人民论坛报”，委国共产党坚决地提出了实行土改、建立民族石油工业和改善劳动人民生活条件之口号，并且为建立一个反对国内反动派和外国侵略势力以争取委国之独立和自由的民族民主统一战线而奋斗着。
    然而，在美帝策动下，委内瑞拉的统治阶级向人民力量发动可耻的进攻了。人民论坛报最近一年来曾数度被迫停刊，到本年一月该报便被封闭了。委政府还公然于五月十三日正式宣布委国共产党为非法。目前，大恐怖业已开始：委共五十余处中心组织已遭封闭；杰出的工会领袖马丁拉米内兹已被捕下狱；石油工人的领袖法里尼亦遭拘押。委共总书记马卡多和其他的委共领袖们业已被迫转入地下。但是，斗争在继续下去，最后失败的必然是美帝和委内瑞拉的反动卖国的统治者，而不是委内瑞拉人民。
