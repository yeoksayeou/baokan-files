　　Peasants in Central and East China Show High Enthusiasm for Production and Resolve to Fulfill This Year's Grain and Cotton Production Increase Plan.
    Central Agricultural and Water Conservancy Inspection Group Returns to Beijing. Minister Li Shucheng Talks About His Inspection Findings.
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 9th] The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Agricultural and Water Conservancy Inspection Group, led by Minister Li Shucheng, returned to Beijing a few days ago after completing its inspection of the Central and East China regions. The group departed from Beijing on May 5th and successively inspected most of the Central and East China regions, including nine provinces: Pingyuan, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong, lasting nearly two months.

    According to Minister Li Shucheng, after arriving in Beijing, "The inspection fully proves that the agricultural production policy determined by the Central People's Government this year is correct. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the peasant masses are now actively working with high production enthusiasm to complete this year's grain and cotton production increase tasks. Peasants in the old liberated areas, where the rural productive forces have been liberated, have generally achieved more plowing, more weeding, and more fertilization in their cultivation, and are enthusiastically demanding improvements in agricultural technology, actively striving to 'increase production by 10% compared to 1949'; peasants in the newly liberated areas, after the struggle against local bullies and for rent reduction, have initially improved their production conditions. At the same time, due to the widespread and in-depth propaganda and implementation of the production policies issued by the Central People's Government by local governments, some peasants' concerns about developing production at the beginning of spring plowing have been eliminated. Therefore, peasants in the newly liberated areas are also actively striving to maintain the production level of 1949. Regions with better conditions are even striving to increase yields; peasants in disaster areas with more production difficulties have also completed sowing in a timely manner. Except for individual areas that suffered particularly severe disasters last year and have not yet been dewatered, other areas have basically achieved the requirement of 'not leaving an acre of land uncultivated'." Talking about the production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, Minister Li especially cited the example of peasants in the Yellow River flooded area. He said, "The peasants in the Yellow River flooded area of Henan, living in a desolate plain, have stubbornly turned most of the local wasteland into fertile fields with human-pulled plows, under conditions of extreme lack of agricultural tools and livestock, and have all planted wheat."

    In order to ensure the realization of this year's grain and cotton production increase plan, peasants in Central and East China have launched a series of struggles against major disasters such as floods, droughts, and insects this spring. Minister Li said, "This year, large-scale flood prevention and dike repair projects have been carried out in Central and East China to prevent floods. Under the call of the local People's Governments, the peasant masses have also automatically opened rivers, dug ditches, and excavated ponds for water storage to carry out drought prevention work, actively preparing favorable conditions for this year's grain and cotton production increase. The peasant masses in Zhejiang and Shandong provinces in East China have also launched large-scale insect extermination campaigns under the leadership of local People's Governments, effectively reducing the threat of several major insect pests such as rice borers." Minister Li then pointed out: Here, the local People's Governments have made great achievements in leading production. Minister Li said, "Peasants in various regions have been able to complete spring plowing and production on time and achieve considerable results under varying degrees of production difficulties, which can only be achieved under the leadership of the People's Government."

    Problems that must be solved were discovered during the inspection.
    Minister Li finally said, "This inspection also discovered some problems that must be solved. For example, in the above-mentioned provinces, especially the newly liberated areas, because there are only some extremely unreliable agricultural production statistics left over from the past Kuomintang rule era, and we have not yet had time to conduct more accurate surveys and statistics, we cannot accurately grasp the basic situation in agricultural production. After this inspection group exchanged opinions with the leading organs of various provinces, the localities are now beginning to pay attention to this issue. Secondly, the agricultural institutions at all levels are not yet sound enough. In order to undertake the heavy task of leading production in the future, this still needs further research and resolution. In addition, we should pay more attention to the prices of agricultural products in various regions in the future. For example, the notice on the ratio of grain to cotton prices issued by the Finance and Economics Committee of the Central People's Government has played a great role in cotton production. We also need to have a good grasp of the prices of all other agricultural products, so as to guarantee the lives of peasants and enable agricultural production to develop normally."

### 中南华东农民生产热情高涨  决心完成今年粮棉增产计划  中央农业水利视察团返京·李书城部长谈视察所得

　　中南华东农民生产热情高涨  决心完成今年粮棉增产计划
    中央农业水利视察团返京·李书城部长谈视察所得
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府农业部农业水利视察团李书城部长等一行，在完成对中南、华东两区的视察后，已于日前返京。该团系于五月五日从北京出发，先后视察了中南、华东两区的大部，计平原、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、江西、浙江、江苏、山东等九个省，历时近两个月。
    据李书城部长抵京后告诉记者说：“这次视察所得，充分证明今年中央人民政府所确定的农业生产方针是正确的。农民群众在人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，现在正以高度的生产热情为完成今年的粮棉增产任务而积极地工作着。农村生产力得到解放的老区的农民，在耕作上普遍地做到了多耕、多锄、多施肥，并热烈地要求改进农业技术，积极地为‘比一九四九年增产一成’而努力；新区农民经过了反恶霸减租的斗争，初步地改善了生产条件。同时由于各地人民政府广泛而深入地宣传和贯彻了中央人民政府所发布的生产政策，春耕开始时某些农民对于发展生产的顾虑业已消除。因此，新区农民也正积极地为保持一九四九年的生产水平而努力。其中条件较好的地区并且都争取提高产量；生产困难较多的灾区农民，也及时完成了播种。除了个别去年灾情特别严重今年尚未脱水的地区外，其他地区已基本上做到了‘不荒一亩地’的要求”。谈到农民群众的生产积极性时，李部长特别举出黄泛区农民为例。他说：“生活在一片荒凉的平原上的河南黄泛区农民，在农具、牲畜极端缺乏的条件下，顽强地用人拉犁的办法，已把当地绝大部分的荒地变为良田，并已全部种上麦子。”
    为了保证今年粮棉增产计划的实现，中南、华东各地农民今春又与水、旱、虫等主要灾害进行了一系列的斗争。李部长说：“今年中南、华东两区都进行了大规模的防洪修堤工程，以防治水灾。各地农民群众又在人民政府的号召下自动地开河挖渠，挖塘蓄水，进行防旱工作，积极地为今年的粮棉增产准备有利条件。华东的浙江、山东两省农民群众并在当地人民政府的领导下开展了大规模的除虫运动，有效地减轻了螟虫等几种主要虫害的威胁。”李部长接着指出：在这里，各地人民政府领导生产是有很大成绩的。李部长说：“各地农民在存在着或轻或重的生产困难的情况下，都能不违农时地完成春耕生产并获得相当成绩，这是只有在人民政府的领导下才能作到。”
    视察中发现一些必须解决的问题
    李部长最后说：“这一次视察也同时发现一些必须解决的问题。如上述各省，尤其是新区，因为只有一些极不可靠的过去国民党统治时代所遗留下来的农业生产统计数字，我们又还没有来得及作较精确的调查统计工作，我们还不能很正确地掌握农业生产上的基本情况。经过这次视察团与各省领导机关交换意见后，现各地已正在开始注意这个问题。其次是各级农业机构也还不够健全，为了要担负起今后领导生产的繁重任务，这还需要进一步研究解决。此外，我们今后更应很好地注意各地农产品的价格问题。如中央人民政府政务院财经委员会所发布的粮棉比价的通告，对于棉花生产起了很大的作用。对于其他一切农产品的价格，我们也需要很好地掌握，这样才能保障农民的生活，使农业生产得以正常发展。”
