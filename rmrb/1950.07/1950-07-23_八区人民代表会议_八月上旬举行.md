The preparatory committee was formally established on the 12th of this month. The preparatory committee consists of thirteen members, including people from government departments, organizations, schools, and industrial and commercial circles. The preparatory committee mutually elected He Yizhang, Secretary of the Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as the director of the preparatory committee, and Jin Yaru, the District Head, and Liang Derui, a citizen, as the deputy directors. The preparatory committee discussed matters such as the organization of the conference secretariat, the allocation of representative quotas, and the focus of issues to be resolved at the conference.
