[Report from our newspaper] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Under the guidance and assistance of the Beijing Labor Bureau and the General Labor Union, many private enterprises in Beijing have established labor-management consultation meetings. As of the end of June, thirteen industries and more than forty factories and shops, including oil, salt, and grain, barber shops, hardware, bathhouses, carpets, weaving and dyeing, mechanized flour, tea, traditional Chinese medicine, new medicine, pottery kilns, Mentougou small coal mines, and Western clothing, have established labor-management consultation meetings. The oil, salt, and grain industry has also established district-level labor-management consultation meetings in nine districts. This has played a significant role in overcoming temporary difficulties in these industries and further restoring and developing production, paving the way for normal labor-management relations in the future.

In late April of this year, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises." Since then, the Municipal Labor Bureau has convened labor and management representatives from thirty-three industries through various means, and the Municipal General Labor Union has also cooperated in convening workers from many industries, explaining to them the significance and importance of labor-management consultation meetings. At the same time, the labor and management representatives of these industries, seeing the achievements made in Tianjin and other places after the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings, have all expressed their approval for the establishment of such institutions. As a result, factories and shops have established labor-management consultation meetings one after another under the guidance and assistance of the Labor Bureau, the General Labor Union, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The establishment of industry labor-management consultation meetings has played a considerable role in solving common problems in each industry. As of the end of June, the New Medicine industry's collective contract and the oil, salt, and grain and carpet industries' labor-management collective agreements have been negotiated and signed by the industry labor-management consultation meetings and approved by the Labor Bureau. After June, collective contracts or temporary agreements for the mechanized flour, weaving and dyeing, hardware, and traditional Chinese medicine industries are continuing to be negotiated.

Since the establishment of these labor-management consultation meetings, labor-management relations in various industries and factories have gradually normalized, and labor-management disputes have been significantly reduced. The Labor Bureau accepted 110 labor disputes in May, which decreased to 82 in June. The pottery kiln industry labor-management consultation meeting, in addition to discussing common methods to overcome difficulties, also resolved the issue of wage arrears owed by the Heshun Pottery Kiln Factory, which had been delayed for three months.

In the initial stage of establishing labor-management consultation meetings in various factories and shops, the focus was generally on how labor and management could jointly overcome difficulties. In particular, the workers automatically reduced wages, carried out savings, rotated home, and reduced welfare benefits, which greatly helped factories and shops with greater difficulties to maintain production and operation.

Labor-management consultation meetings should further focus on both parties jointly improving the operation and management of the enterprise and resolving issues related to both parties based on the principles of democracy, equality, and mutual benefit. In the past two months, the labor-management consultation meetings in some factories and shops in Beijing have begun to conduct consultations in accordance with this spirit, after enlightenment and education from the Labor Bureau and labor unions at all levels for both labor and management. For example, after adopting the business policy of "facing the people" and "small profits but quick turnover," Ruifuxiang Cloth Shop, Longsheng Cloth Shop, Sanyou Industrial Cooperative, and Tongfuju Restaurant have seen their business gradually improve. After the Cihua Weaving and Dyeing Factory established a labor-management consultation meeting in June, it adjusted personnel, improved business management, re-elected specialists from among the shareholders to preside over the business, and mobilized eight former counter staff to participate in production. The Hengdecheng Weaving Factory originally had seventeen or eight employees, which was reduced to twelve after labor-management consultation. However, some factories and shops do not sufficiently recognize the importance of improving business policies and operating methods. Currently, there are still phenomena such as production or operation being out of touch with social needs, overlapping institutions, excessive redundancies, and extravagance, which still need to be greatly improved.

In factories and shops where labor-management consultation meetings are conducted well, a new atmosphere has emerged in each unit because the issues related to both labor and management have been properly resolved: workers are actively producing, and management has increased confidence in operation. For example, due to the active efforts of workers, the output of Daxin Weaving Factory increased by 21% in May, and the quality also increased by 38%. After consulting with labor, the management of Cihua Weaving and Dyeing Factory added four more pieces of capital and ten bundles of yarn.

However, some labor and management representatives in some factories and shops do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of labor-management consultation meetings, resulting in some undesirable ideas and practices. For example, some labor and management representatives in some shops mistakenly believe that labor-management consultation meetings are organizations to overcome temporary difficulties, and feel that there is no need to establish labor-management consultation meetings if there are no difficulties in the store. Some labor representatives want to use labor-management consultation meetings to improve benefits. Some management representatives have the idea of relying on government loans for support and are unwilling to consult with workers; some management representatives deliberately distort the significance of labor-management consultation meetings, attempting to use this to lower workers' benefits, or attempting to pass some unreasonable regulations to suppress labor at the labor-management consultation meetings; even some backward-thinking management representatives feel that it is embarrassing to negotiate issues with workers on an equal footing, and delay the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings under the guise of excuses, as is the case with individual factories in the carpet industry. Such phenomena urgently need to be corrected. In addition, some factories and shops have fewer management representatives, so they cannot recommend the same number of representatives as labor, fearing that they will be at a disadvantage in the consultation meeting, and want to appoint employees to serve as management representatives. After the relevant departments explained the nature of the labor-management consultation meeting to the management, it has been correctly resolved.

### 十三行业建立劳资协商机构  劳资关系改善度过暂时困难  还有些误解会议性质的想法应即改正

　　十三行业建立劳资协商机构
    劳资关系改善度过暂时困难
    还有些误解会议性质的想法应即改正
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：在京市劳动局和总工会的指导与协助下，京市许多私营企业已建立了劳资协商会议。截至六月底，已有油盐粮、理发、五金、浴堂、地毯、织染、机制面粉、茶叶、国药、新药、盆窑、门头沟小窑煤矿、西服十三个行业和四十余家工厂商店成立了劳资协商会议。油盐粮业并在九个区内成立了区一级的劳资协商会议。这对各该行业度过暂时困难，进一步恢复与发展生产起了很大作用，为今后正常的劳资关系铺平了道路。
    今年四月底，中央人民政府劳动部发布《关于在私营企业中建立劳资协商会议的指示》。从那时候起，市劳动局曾通过各种方式，先后召集了三十三个行业的劳资双方，市总工会也配合召集了许多行业的职工，分别向他们说明劳资协商会议的意义和重要性。同时，这些行业中的劳资双方，看到了天津等地建立劳资协商会议后所获得的成绩，对于设立这样的机构无不表示赞同。于是，各工厂商店就在劳动局、总工会和工商联合会的指导与协助下，纷纷成立了劳资协商会议。行业劳资协商会议的成立，对于解决各该行业的共同问题起了相当作用。截至六月底，经行业劳资协商会议协商订立并经劳动局批准的，已有新药业的集体合同，油盐粮和地毯业的劳资集体协议等。六月以后，继续进行协商的，有机制面粉、织染、五金和国药等行业的集体合同或临时协议。
    自成立了这些劳资协商会议后，各行业、各厂店的劳资关系渐渐正常，劳资纠纷已显著减少。五月份劳动局接受的劳资争议有一百一十件，六月份减少到八十二件。盆窑业行业劳资协商会议，除商量出度过困难的共同办法外，还解决了已经拖延了三个月的合顺盆窑厂资方拖欠工资的问题。
    各工厂商店在建立劳资协商会议的初期，一般都着眼于劳资双方如何共同克服困难。特别是职工方面，自动减低工资，开展节约，轮流回家和降低福利待遇，对困难较大的工厂商店维持生产和营业有很大的帮助。
    劳资协商会议应进一步着重于双方在民主、平等和两利的原则下，共同改进企业的经营管理，和解决有关双方问题。京市部分工厂商店的劳资协商会议，两个多月来，经过劳动局和各级工会对于劳资双方的启发与教育，已开始按照这一精神进行协商。如瑞蚨祥布店、隆盛布店、三友实业社和同福居饭庄等，自从采取了“面向人民大众”和“薄利多销”的营业方针后，营业已日渐好转。慈华织染厂于六月份成立劳资协商会议以后，调整人事，改善业务管理，由股东中另推专人主持业务，并动员前柜职员八人参加了生产。恒德成织布厂原有职员十七、八人，经劳资协商后，减少到十二人。但也有些工厂商店，资方对改进经营方针和经营方法的重要性认识不够，目前仍存在着生产或经营与社会的需要脱节，或机构重叠、冗员过多及铺张浪费的现象，还须大力改进。
    凡劳资协商会议开得好的工厂商店，因为适当地解决了有关劳资双方的问题，所以在各该单位中便出现了一派新气象：工人积极生产，资方提高了经营信心。如大信织布厂，由于工人积极努力，五月份产量就提高了百分之二十一，质量也提高了百分之三十八。慈华织染厂的资方在和劳方进行协商后，新增了四件另十捆纱的资本。
    但是，一部分工厂商店的劳资双方，对劳资协商会议的意义认识不足，因而发生了一些不应有的想法和作法。如有些商店的劳资双方误认为：劳资协商会议是克服暂时困难的组织，觉得店内没有困难，就不愿意成立劳资协商会议。有的劳方想借劳资协商会议提高待遇。有些资方存在着依赖政府贷款扶植的思想，不愿意找工人进行协商；有些资方故意曲解劳资协商会议的意义，企图借此压低工人的待遇，或企图在劳资协商会议上通过些压制劳方的不合理的条例；甚至还有一些思想落后的资方，觉得和工人站在平等的地位协商问题，有失面子，借故拖延劳资协商会议的成立，如地毯业中个别工厂就有这样的情况。类此现象，亟需纠正。此外，有些厂店中因资方人数少，不能推出与劳方同等数目的代表，恐怕在协商会议中处于不利的地位，而要指派职员充任资方代表。经有关部门向资方说明劳资协商会议的性质后，已获得正确解决。
