Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. Kim Hyo-seok, the Minister of Interior of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, issued a statement in Seoul on the 5th, exposing the truth about the US imperialists' instigation of the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique to launch a civil war. He said: "Syngman Rhee became a puppet president because he initially put forward the slogan of 'Northern Expedition.' Syngman Rhee attempted to launch the 'Northern Expedition' on July 15, 1949. I also directly participated in this conspiracy and ordered Kim Seok-won (former commander of the 1st Division of the puppet National Defense Forces) to attack and occupy Pyongyang from Ongjin, and ordered Chae Byeong-deok to serve as the commander-in-chief. However, the July offensive plan failed due to the active operations of the People's Guerrilla, which threatened the rear.

This spring, MacArthur summoned Syngman Rhee to Tokyo and instructed him in person: After launching the 'Northern Expedition,' everything should be under MacArthur's command. MacArthur also ordered Syngman Rhee to send the highest military cadres of the puppet National Defense Forces to train together with senior Japanese officers. After Syngman Rhee returned to Seoul, he said: As soon as the 'Northern Expedition' begins, we will immediately receive a large number of American planes and warships for assistance, and Japanese volunteers will participate in the operation. The 'Northern Expedition' will definitely be victorious. Syngman Rhee launched the 'Northern Expedition' at dawn on June 25th based on this arrogant estimate."

Kim Hyo-seok said: "The responsibility for the war should of course be borne by the Syngman Rhee gang and their American masters. But they shamelessly clamor that the war was launched by North Korea,妄想想 to shirk responsibility, which is a baseless lie."

Kim Hyo-seok also revealed that after Syngman Rhee suffered a disastrous defeat in the military, he fled to Tokyo with 100 million US dollars on June 27. His speech broadcasted by Seoul Radio on the same day was actually his recording. Chae Byeong-deok claimed on the 26th in Yongsan that he had occupied Haeju and celebrated with wine, but when the People's Army approached Seoul, he fled in a panic, blew up the Han River Railway Bridge, and killed thousands of his own troops.

In his statement, Kim Hyo-seok also reviewed his own past crimes. He said: "Until this spring, I served as the Minister of Interior of the puppet government, helping Syngman Rhee to carry out the crimes of reporting, imprisoning, and killing patriotic compatriots, and even participated in the traitorous conspiracy to provoke a civil war by launching the so-called 'Northern Expedition.' My crimes can never be washed away. I have no face to see the Korean people again." He swore to the 30 million compatriots that he is determined to atone for his sins and dedicate all his strength to participate in the struggle to eliminate the Syngman Rhee gang under the leadership of the people's regime.

Finally, Kim Hyo-seok said: The complete victory of the People's Army is only a matter of time. He expressed his gratitude for the lenient policy of the people's regime and called on those who are still walking the path of betraying the motherland and the people to repent and start a new life as soon as possible.

　　南朝鲜伪内务长官揭露
    美李发动内战真相
    麦克阿瑟今春曾向李承晚面授机宜
    【新华社平壤八日电】李承晚傀儡政府内务长官金孝锡，五日在汉城发表声明，揭露美帝国主义指使李承晚卖国集团发动内战的真相。他说：“李承晚因为一开始就提出了‘北伐’的口号，所以才当上了傀儡总统。李承晚于一九四九年七月十五日企图发动‘北伐’，当时我也直接参加了这一阴谋，曾命令金锡源（按系前伪国防军第一师团长）从瓮津方面向北进攻占领平壤，并命令蔡秉德充任总指挥。但因人民游击队积极活动，威胁后方，使七月进攻计划宣告失败。
    今年春天，麦克阿瑟把李承晚叫到东京，当面吩咐：在发动‘北伐’后，一切要听从麦克阿瑟的指挥。麦克阿瑟并命令李承晚派遣伪国防军最高军事干部与日本高级军官共同受训。李承晚回到汉城后说：只要‘北伐’一开始，就会立即得到美国大批飞机和军舰的援助，并有日本的义勇军来参加作战，‘北伐’一定胜利。李承晚就根据这种狂妄的估计，在六月二十五日拂晓了发动‘北伐’”。
    金孝锡说：“战争的责任当然要由李承晚匪帮及其美国主子担负。但他们反而无耻地叫嚣战争是由北朝鲜发动的，妄想推诿责任，那是毫无根据的谎言。”
    金孝锡并揭露李承晚在军事上遭到惨败后，就于六月二十七日携带一亿美元逃到东京。同一天汉城电台所广播的他的演讲，实际上是他的录音。蔡秉德于二十六日在龙山扬言业已占领海州，并喝酒庆祝，但当人民军逼近汉城时，他却慌忙逃窜，炸毁汉江铁桥，炸死了自己的军队数千名。
    金孝锡在声明中并检讨了他自己过去的罪恶。他说：“直到今年春天，我曾充当伪政府的内务长官，帮助李承晚进行对爱国同胞的检举、监禁、杀害等罪恶行为，甚至参加了以发动所谓‘北伐’来挑起内战的卖国阴谋。我的罪恶是永远洗不清的，我没脸抬头重见朝鲜人民。”他向三千万同胞宣：誓今后他决心立功赎罪，在人民政权的领导下，献出一切力量，来参加消灭李承晚匪帮的斗争。
    最后，金孝锡说：人民军的完全胜利只是时间问题。他对人民政权的宽大政策极表感谢，并号召迄今仍走着背叛祖国与人民的道路的人们，赶快悔过自新，走向新生之路。
