    Jinan Railway Bureau
    Decides to Oppose Bureaucracy
    [Jinan News] *Dazhong Daily* news: Bureaucracy is prevalent in the Jinan Railway Bureau, and it has now decided to launch a struggle against bureaucracy. The leaders of the bureau do not understand the situation below. Every day they receive a large number of official documents and reports, and they stamp them without knowing what they mean. Sometimes the person in charge stamps the documents without even knowing what they are about. The most typical example is that the Qingdao Engineering Section and the Dispatch Office work in the same compound, but for a small matter, instead of consulting face-to-face or solving the problem by telephone, they send a telegram. The Finance Section and the Material Expediting Section of the bureau are located on the same floor, but they still have to issue an official document to the Tianjin Bureau for the "Certificate" for the transportation of railway supplies, and the official document has to go through ten procedures. An official document is approved back and forth, but the result is that it is approved but not acted upon. For example, last year there was a fire in the storage room of the bureau's main building. The Personnel Department, based on the report from the Transportation Department, intended to reward or punish the individuals respectively. The document was sent to the Transportation Department for stamping in November last year, but it has been missing for seven months; the case of the abolition of the switchboard in the southern suburbs has involved seventeen exchanges of official documents, traveling for half a year, but it has not been abolished yet. The leadership is disconnected from the masses, the work is reduced to formalism, and they are busy with事務 all day long but cannot solve problems. The retained personnel seriously harbor the idea of ​​sticking to conventions and have a perfunctory attitude towards work. Some people regard the ability to write stereotyped official documents as the standard for measuring the ability of cadres and look down on veteran cadres.
    In response to the above situation, the bureau held a joint meeting of secretaries and section chiefs from various sub-bureaus and departments on May 31. It decided to make the opposition to bureaucracy the central task this year and required that the following points be achieved in the future: (1) Leaders at all levels should understand the situation and inspect the work based on the instructions of the higher-level leaders and in combination with on-site operations. (2) Strengthen the responsibility system and inspect the work daily, weekly, and monthly. Implement a signing system. Except for issues that must be handled by official documents, more meetings, oral communication, telephone calls, and other methods should be used to solve problems. (3) Official documents should be popular, have content, analysis, and criticism, correct empty forms, and resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against bureaucracy and red tape.

    济南铁路管理局
    决定反对文牍主义
    【济南讯】大众日报消息：济南铁路管理局普遍存在文牍主义，现已决定展开反文牍主义斗争。该局领导人不了解下面情况，天天公文表报一大堆，盖了章还不知其所以然，有的盖了章主管人并不知道。其中最典型的事例，如：青岛工务段与调度所同住一院办公，为了一件小事，既不当面商洽，也不用电话解决，而要发一个电报。该局财务处检查科与催料处同住一楼，给天津局发铁道用品运送《证明书》也要办个公文，公文旅行需经十道手续。一件公文批来批去，结果是批而不办。如去年该局第一大楼贮藏室失火，人事处根据运务处报告，拟分别奖惩，从去年十一月送运务处盖章，迄今七个月没有下落；南郊撤销交换机案，公文往返十七次，旅行半年，至今仍未撤销。领导与群众上下脱节，工作流于形式，整天忙于事务，不能解决问题。留用人员严重的存在墨守成规的思想，对工作抱应付态度，有的以能否写八股公文为测量干部能力的标准，看不起老干部。
    针对以上情况，该局于五月三十一日召开各分局各处秘书、科长联席会议，决定今年以反文牍主义为中心任务，并要求今后做到下列几点：（一）各级领导干部应根据上级领导意图，结合现场业务，了解情况，检查工作。（二）加强负责制，逐日、逐周、逐月检查工作。实行签注制度，除必须用公文办理的问题外，应多用会议、口头、电话等办法解决问题。（三）公文要通俗、有内容、有分析、有批判，纠正空洞的形式，坚决与官僚主义、文牍主义进行不调和的斗争。
