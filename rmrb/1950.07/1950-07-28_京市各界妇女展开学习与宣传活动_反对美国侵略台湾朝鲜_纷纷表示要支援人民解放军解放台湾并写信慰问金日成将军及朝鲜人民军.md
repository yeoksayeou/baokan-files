　　Beijing Women From All Walks of Life Launch Study and Propaganda Activities
    Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea
    Expressing Their Determination to Support the People's Liberation Army in Liberating Taiwan
    And Writing Letters to Console General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army
    [Our Newspaper] Beijing’s women are enthusiastically launching a study and propaganda movement against American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Women from all walks of life have expressed extreme indignation at the American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, expressing their determination to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and voicing support for the heroic struggle of the Korean people.

    In the No. 1 Clothing Factory, many female workers are participating in art groups to draw cartoons and write slogans to carry out propaganda to all the workers. At a symposium of labor models from various factories convened by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, model seamstress Wei Ruhui said: "American imperialism supports Syngman Rhee and will end up with the same result as its support for Chiang Kai-shek, which is a disastrous defeat."

    Female apprentices at the Agricultural Machinery Factory proposed to speed up production to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the Korean people. The four female apprentices in Zhang Fengquan's group proposed to cooperate with the master's work and strive to complete the production plan for July and August by the end of July.

    Female workers at the Renli Factory use loudspeakers every day to report news of the Korean People's Army's victory to the work rooms. All the female workers of Hengdecheng Textile and Dyeing Factory participated in the propaganda team of the Fourth District, disregarding the heat to publicize the opposition to American aggression against Taiwan and Korea on the streets.

    The families of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory Power Plant and Mentougou Mine have been focusing on the Korean issue for the past few days. They are eagerly concerned about the victory of the Korean people. (Yi Yu)
    At a symposium held by the Municipal Women's Federation on July 26 to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, Yu Xiu'ai, president of the Young Women's Christian Association, said: "The success of the last public bond sale proves that housewives can participate in national affairs. She hopes that women will do more propaganda to neighbors and relatives, so that they know why we sympathize with Korea." Lao Junzhan, chairman of the Peking University Women's Preparatory Committee, said: "The power of weapons is limited, but the power of the people is unlimited. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has proved this point, and the victory of the Korean people is also proving this point." Huang Fumin, director of the Beijing branch of the All-China Women's Federation, said: "In the Korean War, it has become clear that the American empire is a paper tiger." Ma Ruifen from the military family factory in the Sixth District said: "Our factory uses increased production to support world peace, and everyone says that the paper we sign can overwhelm imperialism. We hung up a map of Korea and use the blackboard newspaper every day to report the victory of the Korean people." Wei Xikui from the opera circle said: "Our opera circle must let the audience know in the performance that the United States is an aggressive robber, and this robber is not terrible." Tang, an old lady from a martyr's family, said firmly: "The United States is not terrible. As long as we unite to support the People's Liberation Army, Taiwan will definitely be liberated." Gong Yeya from the Tsinghua Family Women's Association said: "As long as there is justice, there will be strength, so the Korean people always win battles." (Zhu Ying)
    The Tsinghua Family Women's Association has now decided that the nine study group leaders will lead their respective groups to universally launch discussions against American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and will hold a general membership meeting this afternoon (28th) to convey Comrade Fan Changjiang's report on "The Situation of the Korean War." The Yanjing University Women's Association held a symposium on the evening of the 24th and invited Professor Lin Handa to talk about the Korean issue. After listening to the lecture, everyone further recognized the aggressive behavior of American imperialism. Some of the women did not understand the truth about the United States in the past, and felt that the United States was very powerful and that peace signatures were useless. Now they know that the United States is not terrible, and as long as peace-loving people all over the world can unite, American aggression can definitely be defeated. (Shi Liang)
    The trade union of the National First Midwifery School held a meeting on the 25th. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, believing that the realization of the happiness of women and children must resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism and defend world peace. It was also pointed out that the victories we have already achieved and the failure of the United States in North Korea prove that the United States can never prevent us from liberating Taiwan. (Trade Union of the Midwifery School)
    The Beijing branch of the All-China Women's Federation has universally organized anti-American propaganda seminars in various groups. Many members also participated in the propaganda work in various districts. Member Zhang Jieying used the American soldiers' "startle disease" as the title and compiled it into a drum lyric, using popular language to describe the miserable defeat and embarrassment of the American soldiers on the South Korean battlefield. It was very vivid and popular with the masses. (Liaison Group of the Women's Federation)
    The students of the women's Christian association study group are each conducting propaganda to their relatives and neighbors. Family members of employees of the Telecommunications Bureau and the Customs also held small-scale lecture meetings, and everyone enthusiastically participated in the peace signature campaign at the meetings. (Shu Shi)
    Ye Xielingbing, a military family member in the First District, said: "Don't look at the American empire with airplanes, cannons, and atomic bombs, they are greedy for life and afraid of death, and the people oppose them. They will never win a battle. This is a good proof in Korea. The children are fighting on the front line, and we are producing in the rear. The entire Chinese people unite, and Taiwan will definitely be liberated!" Wang Jinzhen, a female labor model in the Tenth District, said: "We are very happy to hear that the Korean sisters have won the battle! We are speeding up production to support the front line and support our people's team, making our army strong and powerful, and liberating Taiwan as soon as possible!" (Zheng Qian)
    Zhou Ruiming, an old lady living in the Second District, said: "We have already written five letters, and we want to comfort the wise General Kim Il-sung and the heroic Korean People's Army." (Wang Fan)
    Housewives in the Ninth District wrote a letter to the Korean sisters saying: "Since the hateful American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppets launched the war, you have bravely fought the invaders. American planes have been shot down, and a large number of American soldiers have been wiped out or captured. We are really happy.
    We are very touched by your spirit of being able to go to work in the factory in place of your husbands, and we must learn from you.
    We Chinese women have stood together with women all over the world who love peace and democracy to support your war, and we believe that you will drive the American imperialists out of Korea."
                              (Huang Sen)

    国立第一助产学校工会于二十五日开会，大家纷纷发言，认为争求妇女儿童幸福的实现，必需要坚决反对美国帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平。并指出我们已得到的胜利和美帝在北朝鲜的失败，证明美帝绝不能阻止我们解放台湾。（助产学校工会）

    你们能代替自己丈夫到工厂里工作，这样的精神，使我们很受感动，我们一定要向你们学习。
    我们中国妇女已和全世界爱好和平、爱好民主的妇女站在一起，支持你们的战争，相信你们一定会把美帝赶出朝鲜去。”
