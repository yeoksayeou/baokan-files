　　America is not "Sacred"
　　Wang Yaping
　　American imperialism, like a mad beast, is making a death struggle, attempting to save itself from death by biting people to death. We should not hesitate to strike down such a beast!
　　American imperialism is a war instigator.
　　American imperialism is the oppressor of the world's oppressed nations.
　　American imperialism is the common enemy of peace-loving mankind.
　　However, this beast's internal organs have long suffered from swelling, and its skin and bones are not very strong. It appears to be a behemoth on the surface, but in fact, it is outwardly strong but inwardly weak.
　　The world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union is consolidating and expanding every day. The peace-loving people of the world are all brave and invincible people. In the face of the world peace and democracy camp, American imperialism has long been at a disadvantage.
　　The Korean War is a good illustration of this.
　　Less than a month after the United States launched its war of aggression, the Korean People's Army crossed the Han River and the Kum River, liberating vast tracts of land. The people of South Korea warmly welcomed their own army, and they began to take up whatever weapons they could use to snipe at the enemy everywhere. Syngman Rhee's army fled in defeat, and the American imperialist army? It does not show any invincible "sacredness" at all.
　　The heroic Korean people are launching a vigorous struggle to build a glorious, victorious, democratic, and free New Korea. General Kim Il-sung's voice has awakened the people fighting for the new birth of their motherland, and they have sworn to march on the enemy and liberate the entire Korean territory!
　　The peace-loving people of the world are enthusiastically supporting the peace movement and supporting the Korean people. They hope that they will win more victories, completely and cleanly eliminate the puppet army, and drive American imperialism out of Korea! Otherwise, eliminate this enemy that is wreaking havoc on Korean soil! Each of us peace advocates must be a brave warrior, and we must unite firmly to jointly defend world peace.

　　美国并不“神圣”
    王亚平
    美国帝国主义，像一个疯狂的野兽，正作着死亡的挣扎，企图用咬死人的方法，来挽救自己的死亡。对于这样的野兽，我们应毫不犹豫地打倒它！
    美帝国主义是战争挑拨者。
    美帝国主义是世界被压迫民族的压迫者。
    美帝国主义是爱好和平的人类的共同的敌人。
    可是，这个野兽的内脏久患肿胀，它的皮骨也不十分坚强，它表面上是庞然大物，而事实上是外强中干。
    全世界以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，天天在巩固着，扩大着。全世界爱好和平的人民，都是英勇的不可征服的人民。在世界和平民主阵营面前，美帝国主义早已不占上风。
    朝鲜的战争，在这方面有了很好的说明。
    美国发动侵略战争还不到一个月，朝鲜的人民军，就越过了汉江、锦江，解放了广大的土地。南朝鲜的人民则热烈地欢迎自己的军队，他们开始拿起能够使用的武器，到处狙击敌人。李承晚的军队败逃了，美帝国主义的军队呢？一点也不表现出有什么不可战胜的“神圣”。
    英勇的朝鲜人民，正为着建设光荣、胜利、民主、自由的新朝鲜掀起了热火朝天的斗争。金日成将军的声音，唤起了为祖国新生而战斗的人民，他们宣誓向敌人进军，解放全朝鲜的国土！
    全世界爱好和平的人民，都在热烈地拥护和平运动，声援朝鲜人民。希望他们多打胜仗，彻底干净地消灭傀儡军，把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜去！否则就消灭这个在朝鲜土地上逞凶的敌人！我们每个和平的拥护者，都要做英勇的战士，大家坚定地团结，共同保卫世界和平。
