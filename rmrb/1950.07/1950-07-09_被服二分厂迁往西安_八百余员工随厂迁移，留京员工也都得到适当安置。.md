　　Clothing Factory No. 2 Relocates to Xi'an
    Over 800 Employees Relocate with the Factory; Remaining Employees in Beijing Appropriately Resettled.
    [Our Newspaper] The Second Branch of the Beijing Clothing Factory of the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region and the Eighth Team of the Tailoring Department, comprising over 800 employees, along with all their machinery and tools, left Beijing on July 1st to relocate to Xi'an. After liberation, the Beijing Clothing Factory of the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region completed the great task of supplying military clothing. Currently, the productive capacity of military clothing in the North China region is excessive, while the original clothing factory base in the Northwest is weak. A portion of the clothing in that region has always relied on the assistance of neighboring regions for supply, requiring long-distance transportation every season, which is uneconomical and time-consuming. Therefore, after discussion by relevant higher authorities, it was decided to relocate the Second Branch of the Beijing Clothing Factory and the Eighth Team of the Tailoring Department, along with their machinery and tools, to Xi'an. In order to properly manage this long-distance relocation, the Municipal Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Political Department of the Quartermaster Department, the Clothing General Factory, the Second Branch, and representatives from the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the Northwest Military Region jointly formed a Relocation Committee, responsible for handling all issues related to the relocation. During the relocation, in order to consider the long-term interests of the workers, employees were mobilized to relocate with the factory to Xi'an and continue to participate in production. The following measures were formulated and implemented for the relocation: Lockstitch workers who remain will all be compensated (one and a half months' salary for those with one year of service, plus half a month's salary for each additional year of service, up to five years of service), and appropriately resettled according to unemployment relief measures (sent to the Labor Bureau). The elderly, weak, sick, and disabled workers among those who remain will all be handled according to retirement procedures.
    Workers who relocate with the factory will continue to receive their salaries from the date of work stoppage due to relocation until the date of resumption of work in Xi'an. All travel expenses en route will be borne by the public, with a food allowance of 4,000 yuan RMB per person per day. Luggage, excluding personal belongings, will be transported by the public in special vehicles. Family members of workers who relocate with the factory will also enjoy the same treatment. Those with family members in Beijing and Tianjin who do not accompany them will be allowed to borrow salary as a settling-in allowance.
    From June 14th, the responsible units held regular meetings to exchange opinions and convened a general meeting of all employees to conduct a comprehensive mobilization and collect everyone's opinions on the relocation. The majority of workers gained a clearer understanding of the relocation work and expressed their firm support for the relocation measures, willing to strive for the construction of the Great Northwest. When the workers departed, they were warmly seen off by the Quartermaster Department, the Labor Department, and the employees remaining in Beijing.

　　被服二分厂迁往西安
    八百余员工随厂迁移，留京员工也都得到适当安置。
    【本报讯】华北军区后勤部军需部北京被服厂第二分厂与裁剪部第八班职工八百余人，携带全部机器工具于七月一日离京迁往西安。华北军区后勤部军需部北京被服厂，在解放后曾经完成了供给军需被服的伟大任务。现因华北地区军需被服生产力过剩；而西北原有被服工厂基础薄弱，该区一部分被服一向依靠友邻地区帮助供应，每季都要经过远途运转，既不经济又费时间。为此，经有关上级研讨，决定将北京被服厂第二分厂与裁剪部第八班连同机器工具一并迁往西安。为了做好这样远距离的迁厂工作，市委会、市总工会、市劳动局、军需部政治部被服总厂与二分厂以及西北军区后勤部军需部的代表曾共同组成了迁厂委员会，负责处理有关迁厂工作的一切问题。在迁厂中为了照顾工人长远利益，曾发动职工随厂迁往西安，继续参加生产。并拟定了下列办法执行迁厂工作：留下来的锁缀工人，均采资遣办法（厂龄一年者发一个半月工资，每增厂龄一年，加发工资半月，至厂龄五年止）并按照失业救济办法（送劳动局）进行适当安置，决定留下的职工中的老、弱、病、残者一律按退职办法处理。
    随厂迁移的工人，自迁厂停工之日起至到达西安后开工之日止工资照发，途中车费全部由公家负责，伙食每人每日补助人民币四千元，行李除自带部分外，由公家以专车运送，随厂迁移之工人眷属亦享受同等待遇，在京津有家属而未随行者，并准予借支工资作为安家费用。
    从六月十四日开始各负责单位经常举行会议交换意见，并召开全体职工大会，进行全面动员，并搜集大家对迁厂的意见，大部分工友们对迁厂工作都有了更明确的认识，纷纷表示坚决拥护迁厂措施，愿为建设大西北而奋斗。工人们在出发时，受到军需部劳动部及留京员工等热烈欢送。
