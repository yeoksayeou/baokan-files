Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th -- The Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army units of the People's Liberation Army have completed this year's agricultural production reclamation and planting plan. According to incomplete statistics up to the end of May, the entire army now has 900,312 mu of cultivated land, of which 772,710 mu are newly reclaimed wasteland, and 637,029 mu have been planted. It is estimated that if there are no disasters this autumn, 150 million jin of grain can be harvested.

　　When the armed forces in the Central South region began agricultural production, the spring plowing season was nearing its end, but through the heroic efforts of the commanders and fighters, they completed a series of arduous tasks from reclamation to planting in less than two months. In the deep snow of Beidahuang (place name) in Heilongjiang (note: the Fourth Field Army units returning to Northeast China to engage in agricultural production are expected to reclaim more than 360,000 mu this year; a certain unit has opened five farms in Beidahuang), and in the mountains of eastern Hunan, the soldiers built their own houses, dug wells, and manufactured farm tools on sparsely populated wastelands, carrying grain from far away. Sometimes, when the grain supply was interrupted, the commanders and fighters ate wild vegetables and beans to satisfy their hunger; when tools were lacking, they used the shovels they used to dig trenches to till the land, and used self-made wooden mallets to break up the soil. At the beginning of the production campaign, the production efficiency was relatively low and the phenomenon of damage to production tools was more serious because the commanders and fighters lacked experience in agricultural production, and the livestock used to pulling gun carriages were not accustomed to plowing fields. A certain battalion damaged five plows on the first day of production. However, after the commanders and fighters humbly learned from the peasants, devoted themselves to studying day and night, re-rationed manpower and livestock, and first selected easy-to-reclaim land for trial cultivation, they finally gained initial experience. After continuous exchange and summarization of experience, they quickly improved their production technology. The average amount of land plowed per plow increased from three mu per day to eight mu. The soldiers further developed their creative wisdom and improved production tools. For example, during the cultivation process, soldiers in a certain unit found that the abundance of grass hindered the plowshare from advancing, so they installed a grass-cutting knife in front of the plow, reducing the resistance of the grass to the plowshare; Liu Changbin, a soldier in a certain unit, invented a curved shovel, which generally increased the efficiency of wasteland reclamation by 50 percent. At present, all units are working intensely on summer weeding and drought prevention in order to strive for a bountiful autumn harvest.

### 中南军区暨四野部  完成本年开垦播种计划  预计今秋可收一亿五千万斤粮

    完成本年开垦播种计划
    预计今秋可收一亿五千万斤粮
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】人民解放军中南军区和第四野战军部队已完成了本年度农业生产的开垦和播种计划。据至五月底的不完全统计，全军现有耕地九十万零三千零十二亩，其中新开的荒地有七十七万二千七百一十亩，已播种的有六十三万七千零二十九亩。预计今秋如无灾害可收获一亿五千万斤粮食。
    中南地区武装部队投入农业生产时，已到春耕行将结束的时节，但经指战员们英勇的突击，不到两个月，即完成了从开荒到播种一系列的艰巨工作。在黑龙江北大荒（地名）的深雪里（按：第四野战军返回东北从事农业生产的部队，预计今年垦荒三十六万余亩；某部已在北大荒开辟了五个农场），在湘东的丛山中，战士们在人烟稀少的荒地上自己搭房、挖井、制造农具，从很远的地方背运粮食。有时粮食接不上，指战员们就以野菜和豆子充饥；工具缺乏，他们就用挖战壕的洋锹挖地，用自做的木槌来捣碎土块。生产运动开始时，由于指战员们还缺乏农业生产的经验，拉惯炮车的牲口也不习惯于耕田，所以生产效率比较低，生产工具被破坏的现象也较为严重，某营在生产的第一天便损坏了五张犁。但经指战员们虚心地向农民学习，日夜潜心研究，把人力、牲口重新合理配备，并首先选择容易开垦的土地进行试耕后，终于取得了初步的经验。再经过不断地交流和总结经验，他们就很快地提高了生产技术。每张犁从每天平均开地三亩提高到八亩。战士们更发挥了自己的创造智慧，改进了生产工具。例如某部战士在耕种过程中因草多妨碍犁头的推进，他们便在犁前装上一把割草刀，减少了草对犁头的阻力；某部战士刘长彬并发明了弯锹，使开荒的效率普遍提高达百分之五十。现各部正紧张地进行夏锄和防旱工作，以争取丰满的秋收。
