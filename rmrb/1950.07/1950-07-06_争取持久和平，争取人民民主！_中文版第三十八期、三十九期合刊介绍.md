Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: The combined issue No. 38 and 39 (total No. 77 and 78) of the Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

Issue No. 38 (total No. 77) is a special commemorative issue for May Day. The articles by communist leaders from many countries published in this issue introduce the state of the workers' movements and the movement to defend world peace in various countries. The editorial in this issue, "The Fighting Tasks of the Struggle for Peace," emphasizes that the leading force in the struggle for peace is the working class, which has recently demonstrated courageous and steadfast examples in the struggle against warmongers. A significant portion of intellectuals are also actively participating in the struggle for peace alongside the working class. However, it is not only the working class and intellectuals who are concerned with the struggle for peace. Winning a solid and lasting peace is in line with the interests of the peasants and the broadest masses of the people. However, the facts show that the vast peasant masses have not yet been fully attracted to actively fight for peace. There are few peace committees in the countryside, and peace voting is mainly conducted among urban residents. Therefore, the editorial calls for all efforts to be made to attract the peasant masses to actively participate in the struggle for peace, so as to bring the movement to defend world peace to a larger scale.

The editorial in Issue No. 39 (total No. 78) is entitled "The Press is the Sharpest Weapon of the Communist Party in the Struggle for Peace." The article points out that the task of the communist and democratic press is to constantly fight against the slanderous propaganda of the reactionary press, tirelessly expose the instigators of new wars, and oppose the preparation of new wars. The main task of the Communist Party, democratic groups, and all progressive humanity at this stage is to fight for peace. Newspapers can provide invaluable service to the peace movement. It should promptly publicize the struggle for peace to the broadest masses of the people, clarify the purpose and tasks of the struggle for peace, report daily on the progress of the peace movement in its own country and around the world, summarize the experience of the peace movement, promote and support the creativity of the masses, and spread new organizational forms for the struggle for peace.

The article "The Tasks of the Cooperative Movement in the Countryside and the Main Principles of the Charter of Rural Production Cooperatives," written by Chervenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, published in Issue No. 39, introduces Bulgaria's experience in developing the cooperative movement in the countryside. When discussing the nature of agricultural production cooperatives, the article states: Agricultural production cooperatives in people's democratic countries can only be a special form of socialist agricultural enterprise in the process of formation, which still retains remnants of private ownership today, mainly remnants of private land ownership, and this situation will gradually change in the future. The article points out that the issue of leadership in the cooperative movement and agricultural cooperatives is of particular significance in Bulgaria. We must ensure that agricultural cooperatives are led by people who have boundless loyalty to the socialist cause, are not afraid of difficulties, and are able to establish a truly prosperous and cultured life for cooperative members. The success of agricultural production cooperatives depends on this.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
     中文版第三十八期、三十九期合刊介绍
    【新华社三日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》中文版第三十八期、三十九期（总第七十七期、七十八期）合刊已经出版。
    第三十八期（总第七十七期）是五一劳动节纪念专号。这一期所登载的许多国家共产党领袖的纪念“五一”的文章，介绍了各个国家的工人运动的状况和保卫世界和平运动的状况。这一期的社论《争取和平的斗争的战斗任务》着重指出：争取和平的斗争的领导力量是工人阶级，它最近已在反对战争贩子的斗争中表现出勇敢与坚贞的范例。有相当大的一部分知识分子，也正与工人阶级一同积极参加和平的斗争。然而，不仅是工人阶级与知识分子关心争取和平的斗争。赢取巩固与持久的和平，是与农民及最广大的人民群众的利益相符合的。可是，事实表明，至今还未充分吸引广大农民群众积极为和平而斗争。农村很少和平委员会，和平投票主要还是在城市居民中进行的。因此，该社论号召：应竭尽一切努力来吸引农民群众积极参加争取和平的斗争，以便使保卫世界和平的运动带着更大的规模。
    第三十九期（总第七十八期）社论题为《报刊是共产党为和平而斗争的最锐利的武器》。该文指出：共产主义报刊与民主报刊的任务，就是经常与反动报刊的诽谤宣传作斗争，不倦地揭露新战争挑拨者，反对准备新战争。共产党、民主团体与全体进步人类现阶段的主要任务，就是为和平而斗争。报纸对于拥护和平运动，可以给予无可估价的服务。它应该及时地向最广大的人民群众宣传争取和平，阐明为和平而斗争的目的和任务，每日都报道自己国家与全世界和平运动的进展，总结和平运动的经验，发扬与支持群众的创造性，传播争取和平的新的组织形式。
    第三十九期所登载的保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记契尔文科夫所写的《合作社运动在乡村中的任务与农村生产合作社章程的主要原则》，介绍了保加利亚在农村中开展合作社运动的经验。该文论到农业生产合作社的性质时说：人民民主国家中的农业生产合作社，只能是在形成过程中的，一种社会主义农业企业的特殊形式，它今天还带有私有制的残余，主要是土地私有制的残余，这种情形将来是会逐渐改变的。该文指出：合作社运动和农业合作社的领导权问题，在保加利亚具有特殊的意义。我们必须使农业合作社为这样的人所领导，他们对社会主义事业有无限的忠诚，不怕困难，有能力给合作社社员建立真正繁荣和有文化的生活。农业生产合作社的成功即取决于此。
