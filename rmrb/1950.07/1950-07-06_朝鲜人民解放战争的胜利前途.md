　　The Korean people's just war to eliminate the invading Korean reactionaries and repel the American aggressors has won the sympathy of progressive people all over the world. Although the entire imperialist world, led by the United States, has used all kinds of despicable and bloody means to try to defeat the Korean people, the Korean people are still advancing victoriously. The Korean War has become the center of current international issues.

　　In the short ten days of the Korean War, the adventurist aggressive group of the imperialist robber Truman exposed its ferocious face of being an enemy of the people all over the world, and at the same time exposed its own weakness, panic, and serious internal contradictions.

　　Now all just people in the world know how American imperialism systematically armed the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet group and directly instructed them to launch a civil war. After the outbreak of the Korean civil war, the United States not only immediately announced the adoption of direct armed intervention in Korea, but also more frantically provoked the people of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The US government disregarded all international credibility, violated the UN Charter, and occupied the "Security Council" as a tool for its aggression, attempting to completely overthrow the principles of the United Nations. This series of criminal actions by the United States has a long history. Taking Korea as an example, the United States fostered the Lee Seung-man reactionary group for five years after Japan's surrender, armed its 100,000 puppet troops and 50,000 policemen, until it was very satisfied that these puppet troops were "capable of fighting." After the US military was forced to withdraw in June 1949, it continued to leave behind a large "military advisory group" and used the "United Nations Commission on Korea" as a cover to prepare for the Korean civil war. After US State Department Special Advisor Dulles climbed onto the parapet of the trenches on the 38th parallel to inspect the South Korean puppet army that had entered combat readiness, and after US Secretary of the Army Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley visited Japan, held secret consultations with MacArthur, and returned to the United States, the robber-style adventurous offensive began. The robbers attempted to extinguish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a sudden adventurous offensive. However, the facts taught them: this was completely wishful thinking. The Korean people have long been highly vigilant against the vicious enemy, so that they were able to repel the enemy's offensive head-on as soon as it began, and quickly turn to a counter-offensive, forcing the enemy to flee in embarrassment.

　　History has proven countless times that aggressors are bound to eat their own bitter fruit. The monstrous crimes committed by the US imperialists and their running dogs in Korea have long aroused boundless hatred among the Korean people. The Korean people have long yearned for peaceful reunification, but US imperialism insisted on creating division in Korea. Over the past four years, US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man group have massacred 150,000 patriotic Korean people, arrested 480,000 patriots, disbanded more than 130 patriotic political parties and organizations, closed ten universities, and expelled a large number of progressive professors and students. US imperialism monopolized more than 90% of the capital in South Korean enterprises; 90% of the mines were forced to shut down; 40% of the cultivated land was abandoned. When the South Korean people's strike struggles and guerrilla warfare rose everywhere, US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man group launched countless armed suppressions and bloody "punitive expeditions." When the Republic government and the Fatherland Front, which were warmly supported by the Korean people, called for the realization of national independence and peaceful reunification of the North and South, which the people of the whole country yearned for, the answer from US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man group was nothing but continued clamoring for "northern expedition," launching thousands of provocations on the 38th parallel, conducting 71 air raids and 42 naval attacks on North Korea, and finally arresting the North Korean peace representatives. This is how US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man group have been enemies of the Korean people and cut themselves off from the Korean people. Now that the all-out war in Korea has been provoked by the United States and Lee Seung-man, the Korean people will never forgive this irreconcilable enemy.

　　The Korean people are so brave that they quickly launched a counter-offensive after the start of the war, liberating Seoul in three days. The various fronts advanced 80 to 115 kilometers in a week; liberating 16 important cities, strongholds, ports, islands, and 6,000 villages, an area of about 20,000 square kilometers. Six of Lee Seung-man's eight divisions have been wiped out or defeated. The People's Army has destroyed 12 American and South Korean puppet warships and 29 aircraft; and captured a large number of American weapons and equipment. The Lee Seung-man puppet army collapsed rapidly in the face of the People's Army's counter-offensive. Senior officials of the puppet group fled for their lives with their luggage. American officers defeated at the Han River front swam to escape. MacArthur flew to the front line in the rain on the 29th to supervise the battle, but could not stop the advance of the People's Army. The South Korean people's guerrillas and the broad masses of the people warmly welcomed the People's Army everywhere, actively cooperated in the war, and expanded the southern liberated areas. The progress of the war was completely contrary to the direction expected by the war provocateurs. This clearly shows the unpopularity and corruption and incompetence of the American running dog Lee Seung-man puppet group; and shows that the anti-people's war of aggression launched by the American war vendors and their running dogs is unjust and therefore bound to fail; and that the Korean people are waging a just war of liberation and therefore will surely achieve victory.

　　But US imperialism is not yet reconciled to defeat. Truman has ordered continued appropriation of funds to "aid" Lee Seung-man, continued reinforcements for MacArthur, ordered the army to participate in the war, expanded the scope of aggression of the navy and air force to north of the 38th parallel, and mobilized Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other countries to send naval and air forces to assist in the war, in order to save the collapse of the South Korean counter-revolutionary front. This will of course make the victory of the Korean people come slower, and the Korean people cannot but prepare for a sustained and more arduous battle. But doesn't the fact that US imperialism has mobilized all these reactionary forces to attack Korea prove that US imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, extremely fragile, and in a fluster? Obviously, all these reactionary forces combined cannot achieve the goal of defeating the Korean people. This is primarily because the imperialists and their running dogs are completely divorced from the Korean people and completely isolated, while the Korean people are completely on the side of justice, united under the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and have won the warm sympathy of the world's peace and democracy camp. Secondly, the United States also has weaknesses in military terms. The strength of the US Army in the Far East is limited, and even less can be used in Korea. Reinforcements are not easy, and morale is not high. The South Korean puppet army is on the verge of collapse, and even if it is rebuilt, it will not have much military effect. The US navy and air force are dominant, but the navy and air force alone cannot determine the outcome of the war. The past Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan and the current Vietnamese War of Resistance Against France are collateral evidence of the victorious future of the Korean people. The Chinese people never had a navy or air force or a modernized army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Vietnamese people are the same. This of course caused considerable difficulties, but it did not prevent the victorious operations of the Chinese and Vietnamese people. It can be seen from this that the armed intervention of the United States and other imperialist countries is by no means a terrible thing. The Korean People's Army has been in control of the initiative of the war since it turned to the victorious counter-offensive. There is no doubt that the Korean People's Army will firmly grasp this initiative, rapidly develop the people's armed forces, and step up the people's political, military, and economic preparations for a sustained war. In the face of such a heroic people who are determined to resist to the end, US imperialism in Korea can only repeat the fate of Japan's failure in China and France's failure in Vietnam.

　　Are imperialist war vendors trying to provoke a third world war under pretext of the Korean issue? On the contrary, the resolute resistance of the Korean people will make the outbreak of a new world war even more difficult. The resistance of the Korean people and the people of other Asian countries to imperialist aggression has taught the imperialist group that this is not the era when it was as easy to occupy Europe as Hitler did and as easy to occupy Northeast China as Japan did. After the Second World War, the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries demanded to break free from imperialist oppression and launched national liberation movements, and in many places developed into armed struggles. This is inevitable. This is the sacred right of the people of all countries, and it is fully in line with the contents of the United Nations Declaration, the United Nations Charter, and other international agreements during or after the Second World War. The imperialist aggression and armed intervention in these countries is unreasonable. The armed intervention of the imperialists can only put themselves in an extremely passive and extremely dangerous position. The imperialist powers are encountering serious difficulties on the Western front and have now turned the East into a front, their crisis has greatly increased. The superficial unity of the imperialist group on intervention in Korea cannot last after encountering strong resistance; the state of US imperialism, which is surrounded by enemies on all sides and deeply mired in the Korean War, cannot last. World public opinion and struggle are powerfully supporting the people of Korea. The world peace and democracy camp, which has a population of more than 800 million, plus the awakened working class and all other progressive people in capitalist and colonial and semi-colonial countries, this force is by no means comparable to the imperialist group which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Therefore, we can fully believe that the Korean people will win the war, and the world peace and democracy camp will smash all the provocations of the imperialists.

### 朝鲜人民解放战争的胜利前途

　　朝鲜人民解放战争的胜利前途
    朝鲜人民为了消灭进犯的朝鲜反动派和击退美国侵略者的正义战争，获得了全世界进步人类的同情。虽然以美国为首的整个帝国主义世界用出种种卑鄙的血腥的手段来想要打败朝鲜人民，朝鲜人民仍然胜利地前进着。朝鲜的战争，已经成为目前国际问题的中心了。
    在朝鲜战争的短短的十天中，帝国主义强盗杜鲁门的冒险侵略集团，暴露了自己与全世界人民为敌的穷凶极恶的面目，同时也暴露了自己的脆弱、惊慌和内部的严重矛盾。
    现在全世界的公正人类都知道美帝国主义是怎样有计划地武装南朝鲜李承晚傀儡集团，并直接指使它们发动内战的了。在朝鲜内战爆发之后，美国不但立即宣布采取对朝鲜的直接的武装干涉的步骤，而且对中国、菲律宾和越南的人民，也更疯狂地进行挑衅。美国政府不顾任何国际信义，违反联合国宪章，霸占“安理会”作为其侵略的工具，企图彻底推翻联合国的原则。美国的这一连串罪恶行动都有其长期的历史。以朝鲜而论，美国曾在日本投降五年间豢养李承晚反动集团，武装了它的十万傀儡军和五万警察，直至很满意地认为这些傀儡军“有能力作战”。在美军被迫于一九四九年六月撤退之后，又继续留下庞大的“军事顾问团”，并以“联合国朝鲜委员会”为掩护，进行朝鲜内战的准备。在美国国务院特别顾问杜勒斯爬进三八线战壕的雉堞上，检阅了已经进入作战准备的南朝鲜傀儡军之后，在美国陆军部长詹逊和参谋长会议主席布莱德雷访问了日本，与麦克阿瑟作了秘密会商回到美国之后，强盗式的冒险进攻就开始了。强盗们企图以突然的冒险进攻来扑灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。可是，事实教训了他们：这完全是妄想。朝鲜人民对于凶恶的敌人早已有了高度的警惕，以至在敌人的进攻刚一开始就能够加以迎头击退，并迅速转入反攻，使敌人不得不狼狈而逃。
    历史已经无数次地证明了侵略者们是一定要自食其果的。美帝国主义者及其走狗在朝鲜所造下的弥天罪孽，早已激起了朝鲜人民的无边仇恨。朝鲜人民久已渴望和平统一，而美帝国主义偏要制造朝鲜的分裂。美帝国主义和李承晚集团，四年来屠杀了十五万朝鲜爱国人民，逮捕了四十八万爱国者，解散了一百三十几个爱国政党和团体，封闭了十个大学，驱逐了大批进步的教授和学生。美帝国主义垄断了南朝鲜企业中百分之九十以上的资本；百分之九十的矿山被迫停工；百分之四十的耕地荒芜了。当着南朝鲜人民的罢工斗争和游击战争到处起来的时候，美帝国主义和李承晚集团就举行了无数次武装的镇压和血腥的“讨伐”。当着朝鲜人民热烈拥戴的共和国政府及祖国战线，号召实现全国人民所渴望的民族独立与南北和平统一的时候，美帝国主义和李承晚集团的回答不是别的，而是继续叫嚣“北伐”，在三八线上举行一千数百次的挑衅，向北朝鲜进行七十一次空袭和四十二次海军袭击，最后并逮捕了北朝鲜的和平代表。美帝国主义和李承晚集团就是这样与朝鲜人民为敌，自绝于朝鲜人民。现在朝鲜全面的战争已经被美国和李承晚挑起来了，朝鲜人民就决不能饶恕这不共戴天的敌人。
    朝鲜人民这样的英勇，在战争开始后迅速反攻，三天就解放了汉城。各个战线在一星期内推进了八十公里到一百十五公里；解放了十六座重要的城市据点和港口岛屿以及六千个村庄，约两万平方公里的地区。李承晚全部八个师团的兵力，已经被歼灭或击溃了六个师团。人民军已击毁了美国的和南朝鲜傀儡的军舰十二艘、飞机二十九架；缴获了大批的美式武器和装备。李承晚傀儡军在人民军反攻的面前，迅速崩溃了。傀儡集团的高级官员抱了行李逃命。美军在汉水前线战败了的军官泅水而逃。麦克阿瑟二十九日冒雨飞往前线督战，也不能阻挡人民军的前进。南朝鲜的人民游击队和广大人民，到处热烈地欢迎人民军，积极配合作战，扩大了南部解放区。战争的进展，与战争挑拨者预期的方向完全相反。这显然地说明了美国走狗李承晚傀儡集团的众叛亲离和腐败无能；说明了美国战贩及其走狗所发动的是非正义的反人民的侵略战争，因而一定要失败；朝鲜人民所进行的则是正义的解放战争，因而一定能取得胜利。
    但是美帝国主义现在还没有甘心失败。杜鲁门已经下令继续拨款“援助”李承晚，继续增援麦克阿瑟，下令陆军参战，海空军扩大侵略范围到三八线以北，并且动员了英、澳、新西兰等国派遣海空军助战，以挽救南朝鲜反革命战线的崩溃。这当然会使朝鲜人民的胜利来得慢些，使朝鲜人民不能不准备进行持续的和较为艰苦的战斗。但是，美帝国主义动员了所有这些反动力量来进攻朝鲜，这难道不是证明美帝国主义的外强中干、极端脆弱手忙脚乱吗？显然的，所有这些反动力量加在一起，仍然不能达到战胜朝鲜人民的目的。这首先是因为帝国主义者及其走狗是完全脱离朝鲜人民和完全孤立的，而朝鲜人民是完全站在正义方面，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领导之下，团结一致，并且得到世界和平民主阵营的热烈同情。其次，美国在军事上也有弱点。美国陆军在远东力量有限，能用在朝鲜的更少，增援不易，士气不高。南朝鲜的傀儡军队已经接近崩溃，即使重建，在军事上也不会有多大作用。美国的海空军是占优势的，但是单单海空军并不能决定战争的胜负。过去的中国抗日战争和现在的越南抗法战争都是朝鲜人民胜利前途的旁证。中国人民在抗日期间始终没有海空军和近代化的陆军，越南人民也是如此，这当然造成相当的困难，但是这并没有妨碍中越两国人民的胜利作战。由此可见，美国和其他帝国主义国家的武装干涉，决不是什么可怕的东西。朝鲜人民军自从转入胜利的反攻以来，一直掌握着战争的主动权。毫无疑问，朝鲜人民军将牢牢掌握这个主动权，迅速发展人民武装力量，加紧人民对于持续战争的一切政治上、军事上、经济上的准备。在这样的决心抗战到底的英勇的人民面前，美帝国主义在朝鲜将只能重复日本在中国和法国在越南的失败命运。
    帝国主义战争贩子们企图借口朝鲜问题来挑动第三次世界大战吗？相反，朝鲜人民的坚决抵抗将使新的世界战争的爆发更加困难。朝鲜人民和亚洲其他国家人民对于帝国主义侵略的抵抗，教训了帝国主义集团，现在不是像希特勒那样容易占领欧洲和日本那样容易占领东北的时代了。殖民地、半殖民地各国人民，在第二次世界大战后要求挣脱帝国主义压迫，展开了民族解放运动，并且在许多地方发展为武装斗争。这是不可避免的。这是各国人民的神圣权利，而且完全符合于联合国宣言、联合国宪章和世界第二次大战期间或以后的其他国际协议的内容。帝国主义对这些国家的侵略和武装干涉，是毫无道理的。帝国主义者的武装干涉，只能把自己陷于极端被动和极端危险的地步。帝国主义者在西方战线正在遭遇严重的困难，现在又把东方变为前线，他们的危机是大大增加了。帝国主义集团对于干涉朝鲜的表面一致，在遇到坚强的反击以后，是不能持久的；四面树敌的美帝国主义深陷朝鲜战争泥沼的状态，也是不能持久的。全世界人民的舆论和斗争都有力地支援着朝鲜的人民。拥有八万万以上人口的世界和平民主阵线，加上资本主义和殖民地、半殖民地各国的觉悟的工人阶级以及其他一切进步人民，这个力量决不是外强中干的帝国主义集团所能够比拟的。因此，我们可以完全相信：朝鲜人民将获得战争的胜利，而世界和平民主阵营将击破帝国主义者的一切挑衅。
