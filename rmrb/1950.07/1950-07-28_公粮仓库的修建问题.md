　　The Construction of Public Grain Warehouses
　　Qin Hanzhang

　　I

　　Agricultural tax is currently the state's main source of income, accounting for 37.2% of the state's total revenue in 1950. Such a large amount of grain naturally requires reasonable warehouses for storage at the grain transportation and concentration points in various regions. In the past, we did not have the capacity to carry out large-scale grain warehouse construction. After the centralized management of grain, losses often occurred. For example:

　　(1) Shanxi Province discovered serious grain loss during a survey of grain warehouses. According to preliminary statistics from early May, the total amount of new and old grain lost due to mold, spoilage, germination, insect infestation, and warehouse collapses amounted to more than 1,138,000 jin across the province. The most serious losses were due to mold and spoilage, totaling over 710,000 jin. (See Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st, June 10th, People's Daily)

　　(2) Due to the untimely turning and drying of grain, the Linnan Grain Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yutian County, Hebei Province, caused more than 43,000 jin of corn shipped from the Northeast by the county cooperative to mold. (See People's Daily, Yutian News, same date)

　　For example, in Baoding Prefecture, out of 32 wheat warehouses, 13 were inspected, and 7 were found to have mold and insect infestation, damaging 600-700 jin of grain. In Tongxian Prefecture, 8 warehouses were inspected, and 4 had spoilage problems, resulting in a loss of nearly 1,000 jin of grain. In Dingxian Prefecture, 74 grain depots were inspected, and 14 had spoilage problems, resulting in a loss of more than 17,000 jin of grain. Handan Prefecture suffered the greatest losses. All 19 grain depots inspected had spoilage problems, resulting in a loss of 20,000 jin of grain. In Tangshan Prefecture, all 9 warehouses inspected had spoilage problems. (See People's Daily)

　　From these examples, we can see that after a short period of inspection, many problems have been found in grain warehouses across various regions. The main reason for the losses is poor warehouse construction.

　　II

　　The public grain collection policy adopts a centralized storage approach. Large quantities of grain are delivered from all directions to a designated location, which is precisely where the public grain warehouse should be built. This location is specifically referred to as the grain depot base and should be prepared first. The base for constructing warehouses should be selected along major land and water transportation routes or near the entrance of rice and flour processing plants. The conditions are as follows:

　　(1) Appropriate location with convenient access.
　　(2) Close to main roads, with smooth and level surfaces.
　　(3) Slightly elevated land for easy drying, with low-lying waterways for easy drainage.
　　(4) The area occupied by the base should be longer in the east-west direction and narrower in the north-south direction.
　　(5) The west and south sides of the warehouse should ideally have the shelter of forests, bamboo groves, or cliffs and hills.
　　(6) The base area should be more than twice the plane of the warehouse building.
　　(7) Sufficient space should be left at the front and rear for future expansion.
　　(8) The warehouse itself should not be connected to residential buildings.

　　Grain warehouse structures mainly include the following five types:

　　(1) Earth warehouses: mostly built of mud.
　　(2) Brick warehouses: mostly built of bricks.
　　(3) Stone warehouses: mostly built of stone strips or blocks.
　　(4) Board warehouses: mostly built of wooden pillars and boards.
　　(5) Steel-reinforced concrete warehouses: the most advanced modern grain warehouses.

　　In terms of form, they can be divided into rectangular, long rectangular, conical, etc. The construction and form of these grain warehouses can be appropriately adapted according to the local main materials and economic conditions. Use more mountain stones near mountain villages and more wooden boards near forests. In large cities where land prices are very high, new conical steel-reinforced concrete structures can be used.

　　Various warehouses should meet the following standards in terms of construction engineering:

　　(1) Earth warehouses: This is a unique construction method in the Northwest regions. The construction cost is relatively low, making it most suitable for rural areas. In terms of construction, it can be divided into roofs, foundations, walls, windows, and doors, which are explained one by one:

　　Roof: Roofs are divided into single or double layers. The structure of a single-layer roof usually involves placing fir bark on wooden boards first, followed by a layer of mud three to four inches thick. The roofs should be matched with each other. The upper layer can be parallel to the lower layer, or the angle formed can be narrower than the angle formed by the lower layer. Double-layered roofs are more beneficial for storing grain because they provide greater shielding from direct solar heat.

　　Foundation: Foundations are divided into soil, stone, wood, three-aggregate soil, cement, and asphalt, among other types. The foundations of ordinary public grain warehouses are mostly concrete, with a layer of cement applied on top. Working and walking on this type of foundation is convenient, and it also has the effects of preventing rats and moisture and is not easily damaged. Wooden foundations are made of wooden boards. The bottom of the foundation may be the mud surface of the land itself or three-aggregate soil. However, ventilation holes should be provided in the wooden board foundation. Soil foundations involve using self-made rectangular mud bricks from rural areas to form the foundation, then mixing in an appropriate amount of bitter brine and re-tamping to make it firm. Stone foundations are divided into stone strips and crushed stones. Stone foundations cannot completely keep the grain dry. Therefore, when storing grain, rice cannot be directly loaded in bulk on the ground.

　　Walls: Walls can be built by imitating the general construction method of houses in Sichuan, first making lattices with bamboo strips or wooden strips, and then coating them with mud. The thickness of the walls has a significant impact on the temperature inside the warehouse. The thickness of ordinary walls must be at least five to six inches, and preferably seven to eight inches. The walls should be coated with plaster or left unpainted. In order to protect the grain stored inside the warehouse from rain and snow in winter and sunlight in summer, a layer of wooden boards can be placed around the outside of the walls, at a distance of two feet. The inner surface of the walls should be smooth and free of cracks. Smooth walls not only prevent the growth of fungi and warehouse insects but also reduce obstacles in terms of preventing damage and reducing cleaning. All walls inside the warehouse should be replastered with mud once every three years, so that the larvae of insects or spores of mold can be buried in the mud, which is also beneficial for the storage of public grain. If the inner surface of the walls is completely enclosed with wooden boards, this "cavity wall" should be about one foot away from the mud wall.

　　Windows: The purpose of opening windows in a warehouse is to allow light and ventilation. When public grain is stored in the warehouse, it generates heat (caused by fermentation). The hot air emitted by fermentation is lighter and rises easily, concentrating in the roof area. Therefore, ventilation windows, which are smaller than ordinary windows, must be installed near the roof beams in the upper part of the warehouse. These windows should be opened regularly to allow ventilation without allowing rain to enter. Newly built earth warehouses often have small windows of about six to seven inches square in the gaps at the bottom of the walls, and they are fitted with wire mesh. Ordinary windows are about two to three feet, with wire mesh installed outside to prevent insects or birds from entering. Windows used for lighting should be located on the north side and fitted with glass. The number of windows can be determined by the volume of the warehouse.

　　Doors: Usually wooden doors or fire doors. The upper half of wooden doors is often lattice-shaped or made of wire mesh. Fire doors come in two types: double doors and single doors.

　　Warehouse base: The warehouse base for public grain should be slightly raised to facilitate drainage. The wall base should be excavated to a depth of about two feet and a width of two to three feet. Usually, crushed stones are mixed with concrete to form the foundation, and two to three layers of long stone strips are laid on top.

　　If the foundation is loose and the geological structure is not ideal, pine wood piles should be erected in the soil to make the warehouse base more solid.

　　(2) Brick warehouses and stone warehouses are built using bricks or stones respectively. The architectural forms of brick warehouses and stone warehouses are generally the same as those of the earth warehouses described above. Durability, solidity, and fire prevention are the main goals. The walls of brick warehouses are about one and a half bricks thick. The walls of stone warehouses are built by stacking the original square stone blocks.

　　(3) Board warehouses: Built using wooden boards, board warehouses are specifically used for storing yellow millet and brown rice, but are not suitable for storing white rice. The main building materials are wooden tiles and foundation stones. The front of the door is usually two to three rooms wide, with a stone base every three feet and a wooden pillar erected. Wooden boards are stretched horizontally between the wooden pillars and connected around the perimeter to form a board warehouse. The bottom layer is about one to two feet above the foundation stone, and the roof is covered with one or two layers of wooden tiles. Windows may be completely absent or only one window may be installed. Wooden steps are provided at the entrance and exit, and a short eaves door is also installed above, made of wooden boards.

　　If brown rice is stored in sacks and then stored in a board warehouse, no other equipment is needed inside the warehouse. If it is stored in bulk without sacks, the inside of the board warehouse should usually be divided into several small rooms, about three feet deep. When storing rice, wooden boards are first embedded on three sides, and one side is left as a door. As the rice is gradually loaded, the wooden boards are also installed to the top. When unloading rice, the rice is gradually taken out from top to bottom. When the rice warehouse is half empty, the wooden boards are also removed to half the height.

　　(4) Steel-reinforced concrete grain warehouses: In large cities, due to the dense population and limited land, ordinary warehouses are difficult to cope with. Steel-reinforced concrete grain warehouses should be built to store large quantities of public grain. As for flour mills or rice mills, this type of equipment can also be used.

　　The basic construction of steel-reinforced concrete grain warehouses is mostly three-story or higher buildings, with parallel rectangular concrete grain depots (or grain towers) on each floor. Hoisting machines or suction machines are used to transport public grain from grain ships docked in waterways or from trucks parked on roads to the grain depots on the top floor. Once the grain reaches this part, it can flow freely into the real grain depot.

　　There should be no sharp angles or depressions inside the warehouse to avoid hiding insects or other dirt brought in by the rice. The rice should be turned and reloaded every day to prevent heat generation and parasitic or other diseases.

　　III

　　Packaging rooms, inspection rooms, and fumigation rooms: These buildings are all ancillary buildings of public grain warehouses. Each has a specific purpose. The packaging room is the place for packaging and bagging, the inspection room is the place for inspecting the biological, physical, and chemical properties of rice, and the fumigation room is the place for preparing fumigation drugs and equipment, as well as fumigating and disinfecting grain bags. The packaging room and inspection room should be located in front of the warehouse entrance and exit, and the conditions are as follows: (1) At least two or more dedicated rooms should be provided, (2) The walls should be gray or light blue, (3) The entrance of the packaging room and inspection room should not be directly aligned with the warehouse door. The fumigation room should be located in the same area as the warehouse. The construction method can be the same as that of the earth warehouse, but the entrance and exit should be winding and convoluted for airtightness and to prevent air leakage.

　　In addition to the grain warehouse buildings, the various equipment that should be available for storing public grain is divided into six categories: packaging equipment, drying equipment, inspection equipment, fumigation equipment, processing equipment, and transportation equipment. Various regions can allocate them as appropriate according to actual conditions.

　　Packaging equipment includes new-style floor scales or platform scales, old-style Chinese scales, etc. to calculate the weight of the grain; various types of measuring tools to calculate the volume of the grain; hemp sacks, straw sacks, and cattail sacks to hold the specified amount of rice. As for the hemp thread for sewing the sack openings, etc., it should also be available.

　　Drying equipment includes old-style drying grounds, new-style dryers, and ancillary tools such as "winnowing shovels" and "scoops," which should also be equipped.

　　Inspection equipment includes grain probes, hand huskers, thermometers, hygrometers, coarse balances, drying ovens, evaporating dishes, incinerators, and other large and small tools.

　　Fumigation equipment includes racks, picric chloride volatilization tanks, sprayers, fans or electric fans, depending on the actual situation.

　　Processing equipment includes rice hullers, rice milling machines, etc. In the organizational system of large grain depots, this type of tool should be listed as necessary equipment.

　　Transportation equipment includes buckets (elevators), screw conveyors, pulleys, trucks, carts, oxcarts, and wooden boats or motorboats, which facilitate the entry, storage, and exit of grain.

　　IV

　　At present, most parts of the country have completed the summer harvest and have begun the summer collection work. Large quantities of public grain wheat across the country have been collected and put into storage or are about to be put into storage. After these scattered public grains are concentrated, how to do a good job in the storage of public grain is a major issue after collection.

　　After the public grain is concentrated throughout the country, many places will inevitably reflect that the warehouse is not enough and request to add or repair new warehouses. The construction of warehouses should be completed under certain conditions and cannot be carried out carelessly based solely on experience or theory. According to the individual circumstances of various regions, in conjunction with the specific conditions at the time, design and repair old warehouses or add new warehouses in the long term to complete the task of centralized storage of public grain, so as not to suffer accidental and unnecessary losses in warehouses with unreasonable equipment. This is the most important thing at present.

　　Grain storage work is very important. It must be clear the importance of warehouse construction. Do not let the good grain be placed casually without warehouses, without protection, and without treatment, so that the public grain molds, breeds insects, or rots under a few reed mats. Bad warehouses should be repaired in advance, warehouses that are lacking should be built in advance, and unreasonable warehouses should be changed into reasonable warehouses. We should pay attention to solving the problem of building these public grain warehouses in order to protect the property of the motherland.

　　公粮仓库的修建问题
    秦含章
    一
    农业税是国家目前的主要收入，要占据一九五○年国家全部岁入的百分之三十七点二，这么多的粮食，在各地的粮食运输集中点，当然要用合理的仓库来储藏。由于过去我们还没有可能来大规模进行粮仓的修建工作，所以在粮食集中管理之后，时常发生粮食遭受损失的现象。例如：
    （１）山西省在普查粮食仓库工作中，发现大量粮食遭受损耗的严重现象。仅据五月上旬初步统计，全省新旧粮食因霉烂、变味、生芽、生虫、……塌库等损失的粮食共达一百一十三万八千余斤。损失中最严重的是霉烂、变味，计达七十一万余斤。（见六月十日人民日报载新华社太原一日电）
    （２）河北省玉田县林南仓供销分社，因翻晒粮食不及时，致使县社拨给的东北玉米霉烂了四万三千余斤。（见同日人民日报玉田讯）
    又如保定专区有麦库三十二处，经过检查的十三处，即有七处发现霉烂和生虫，损坏粮食六七百斤。通县专区检查了八个仓房，有四个发生坏粮现象，损失粮食近千斤。定县专区检查了七十四个粮库，发生坏粮者有十四个，损失粮食一万七千多斤。邯郸专区损失最大，检查十九个粮仓均有坏粮，损失粮食二万斤。唐山专区检查九个仓库，也是仓仓都有坏粮。（见人民日报）
    从以上这些例子看来，可知各地粮仓在短时期内经过检查，不少发生问题。而耗损的原因，主要是由于仓库修建的不善。
    二
    公粮征收是采取集中保管政策，大量的粮食从四面八方送缴到一个指定的地点，这个地点正是公粮仓库建筑的位置所在，特称为粮仓的基地，首先应该筹备妥当。建筑仓库的基地，应该是选择水陆交通要道，或邻近米面加工厂的入口部分。其条件如下：
    （１）位置适当，出入便利。
    （２）接近通衢，道路平整。
    （３）土地稍高，便于干燥，水道低下，便于排泄。
    （４）基地面积所占地带宜东西长而南北狭。
    （５）在仓库的西向至南向最好有树林、竹林，或山崖，丘陵等的荫蔽。
    （６）基地面积应为仓库建筑平面的二倍以上。
    （７）前后留有余地，可供日后扩充。
    （８）仓库本身不宜与住房相连接。
    粮仓构造，主要有下列五种：
    （１）土仓  大部以泥土筑成。
    （２）砖仓  大部以方砖筑成。
    （３）石仓  大部以石条或石块筑成。
    （４）板仓  大部以木柱及木板筑成。
    （５）钢骨水泥仓  最进步的现代粮仓。
    就其形式上，则可分为立方形，长方形，圆锥形等，这些粮仓的建筑和形式，都可以根据当地的主要材料、经济条件，作适当处理。靠近山村，多用山石，靠近森林，多用木板。大都市地价很贵，可采用圆锥形的新式钢骨水泥建筑。
    各种仓库，在建筑工程方面，应该具备的标准如下：
    （１）土仓  这是西北各地特有的建筑方法；建筑费用较廉，最适合于农村之用。在建筑方面，可分为屋顶、底层、墙壁、窗门等，兹逐一说明：
    屋顶  屋顶分为一重或二重。一重屋顶的构造普通于木板上先置杉树皮，后再敷以厚三寸至四寸的泥土。屋顶彼此宜配合，上层的屋顶可与下层的屋顶并行，或所成角度比下层的屋顶所成角度较狭亦可。二重形式的屋顶，因为遮蔽太阳直射热的作用较大，所以对于贮藏粮食方面就较为有利。
    底层  底层分为土质、石质、木质、三和土质、洋灰质以及柏油质等数种。普通公粮仓库的底层，大都为混凝土质，上面再粉上一层洋灰。在这种底层上工作，来往行走方便，且有防鼠防湿的功效，亦不易损坏。木质底层即用木板所制成。其底层的下面，或为土地本身的泥面，或为三和土。但均应在木板底层设置通风洞。土质底层，即应用农村自制的即长方形泥块铺成底层，再混加适量的苦盐卤，重行踏压，使之坚固。石质底层又分为条石与碎石两种。石质底层不能完全保持粮食干燥状态。因此，在贮粮时，不能直接在地面散装米粮。
    墙壁可仿照四川一般建筑房舍的办法，先以竹篾或木条做成格子，再涂上泥土。墙壁的厚薄，与仓内的温度有重大的关系，普通墙壁的厚度至少须在五——六寸以上，最好有七——八寸。墙壁应涂加灰泥或不施粉饰。为了冬季避雨雪，夏季避阳光，而保护仓内所藏谷米起见，亦可在墙壁的外围，相距二尺的地方，再围绕木板一层。墙壁的内面，务求平滑，不可有凹凸的裂痕；平滑的墙壁不仅有防止菌类及仓库虫类孳生的功效，即于防免损坏，减少清除等障碍方面，亦有不少好处。凡仓库内的墙壁，连续应用了三年，就应以泥土重新圬涂内壁一次，借使昆虫类的幼虫，或霉菌类的胞子等，随同圬入泥土，亦于公粮保管上有利。如果墙壁的内面，全部围装木板，此项“复壁”应与泥墙相离约一尺内外。
    窗  仓库开设窗户，目的是在透光通气。公粮贮在仓内时有发热现象（由发酵作用所引起），发酵作用所散出来的热空气，质较轻，易上腾，多集中在屋顶部分。因此仓库上部的屋梁附近，必须设置通风窗，即面积较小于普通窗，经常开放，通气而不进雨。新筑土仓，多于墙壁下部之隙间，设置小窗，方约六至七寸，并装妥铁丝网。普通窗口约为二至三尺，口外装有铁丝网，借以阻止昆虫或飞鸟的进出。凡取光用的窗，应设在北面，并嵌玻璃。窗的数目，可视仓库的容积而定。
    门  通常为木门或防火门。木门的上半截，多为格子形或铁丝网。防火门则有双门与单门两种。
    仓基  公粮仓库的仓基宜稍行填高，以便泄水。墙基约掘深二尺，宽二至三尺。普通以碎石合于混凝土内打成基础，并于其上铺筑长形的石条二至三层。
    如果地基松软，地层构造不合理想，则为使仓库基地变得较为坚固起见，应于土内竖立松木桩。
    （２）砖仓及石仓系分别利用方砖或石块筑成。砖仓与石仓的建筑形式大体同上述土仓。以耐久、坚固、防火为主要目的。砖仓的墙壁，约为一块半砖的厚度。石仓的墙壁，即以原有的方条石块堆砌而成。
    （３）板仓  利用木板筑成，板仓专供储藏黄谷及糙米，但不适宜于白米的贮藏。其建筑材料，以木瓦及基石为主，门前普通约广二至三间，每隔三尺，立一石基，竖一木柱。木柱与木柱之间，横张木板，四围相连，即成板仓。底层距基石约高一至二尺，屋顶用木瓦一重或二重。窗户或全不设置，或仅设一窗。进出处设木质阶级，上方并装短檐门，亦用木板制成。
    糙米如装入麻袋后再贮藏于板仓内，则仓内不需要任何其他装置；如不装麻袋而用散藏法，则于板仓内部，普通应分划为若干小室，纵深约三尺。藏米时，三面先嵌满木板，一面留作门户，渐装渐加，待米粮装满小室时，木板亦随之而装至最上的一块。卸米时，由上而下，逐步取出米粮；待米仓空至一半，则木板亦卸至一半。
    （４）钢骨水泥粮仓，在大都市中，因人口密集，地基有限，普通仓库已不易应付，则建筑钢骨水泥粮仓，以收藏大量的公粮。至于面粉厂或碾米厂，亦可利用此项设备。
    钢骨水泥粮仓的基本建筑，大都为三层或三层以上的楼房，每层设置平行的长方形的混凝土构成的粮库（或称粮塔）；利用升运机或吸气机将公粮自停在河道内的粮船中或停在马路上的汽车中升运至最上层的粮库间；粮食到了这一部分，就可自由流入真正的粮库中了。
    库内不应留有锐角或凹陷，以免暗藏昆，或其他由米粮带进来的污物。米隔粮每一日，宜轮流翻装一次，以免发热及寄生虫害或病害等。
    三
    包装室、检查室及熏蒸室  这些房屋，都是公粮仓库的附属建筑。各有特定的用处，包装室是打包装袋的场所，检查室是检验米粮的生物性、物理性及化学性的场所，熏蒸室是准备熏蒸药品及器械，以及熏蒸消毒粮袋的场所。包装室及检查室应设置于仓库出入口的前面，其条件如下：（１）至少有二间以上的专备房屋，（２）墙壁取灰色或淡蓝色，（３）包装室及检查室的进门不宜与仓门成一直线。熏蒸室宜设置于仓库的同一区域内。构造方法可与土仓相同，惟进出口宜取曲折转绕的形式，以便密闭，不易泄气。
    保管公粮，除粮仓建筑物以外应有的各种设备，计分：包装设备、干燥设备、检验设备、熏蒸设备、加工设备及运输设备等六类。各地可按实际情况，酌量配备。
    包装设备计有新式的地秤或座秤，老式的中国秤等以计算粮食的重量；各种各样的斛斗，以计算粮食的容量；麻袋、草袋及蒲袋以装盛规定数量的米粮。至于缝袋口的麻线等，亦应具备。
    干燥设备计有老式的晒场，新式的干燥机，以及附属工具如“扬铲”“奔斗”等，亦均应配备。
    检验设备计有粮扦、手砻、温度计、湿度计、粗天平、烘箱蒸发皿、烧灰炉及其他大小工具等。
    熏蒸设备计有架子，氯化苦剂挥发罐、喷雾器、风扇或电扇等，视实际情形而变。
    加工设备计有砻谷机、碾米机等。在大粮库的组织系统内应将这一类的工具列为必要的设备。
    运输设备计有奔斗（升运机），螺旋运送装置、滑车、卡车、大车、牛车以及木船或机船等，便于粮食的进仓、存仓及出仓等工作的进行。
    四
    目前，全国各地大半已完成夏收并已开始夏征工作，全国大批公粮小麦已收缴入库或即将入库。当这些分散的公粮集中起来之后，如何作好公粮的保管工作，便是征收以后的一个重大问题。
    全国公粮集中之后，许多地方不免反映仓库不够，要求添建或修建新仓库。建筑仓库应该在具备一定的条件下完成，不能只凭经验或学理而马虎从事。根据各地的个别情况，配合当时的具体条件，从长设计修理旧仓库或添建新仓库，来完成公粮集中保管的任务，不使其在设备不合理的仓库中横遭意外的无谓耗损。这是目前最重要的事。
    粮食保管工作是十分重要的，必须明白仓库修建的重要性，不要再让大好的粮食，因为没有仓库而随便放置，不加保护，不加处理，遂使公粮在几张芦席底下发霉、生虫、或腐败。坏的仓库要预先修理，缺乏仓库要预先建筑，不合理的仓库要改成合理的仓库。我们应该为了保护祖国的财产而注意解决这个公粮仓库的修建问题。
