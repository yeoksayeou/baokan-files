　　"The Chinese People Cannot Be Intimidated"
    -- Voices of Labor Heroes
    I just returned from abroad. In factories and schools in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, I saw portraits of Chairman Mao hanging. Peace-loving people all over the world love our Chairman Mao! American imperialism wants to disrupt peace in the Far East, and the Chinese people will not agree, nor will the people of the world! If he dares to move, he will bring about his own destruction.
                          Locomotive Driver of Locomotive No. 1939, Labor Hero, Li Yonglu
    Truman is a liar and a robber! When he can't deceive people, he tries to intimidate them. In fact, he is purely a paper tiger and cannot intimidate anyone. The Chinese people cannot be intimidated.
    Even if Truman really goes crazy and recklessly launches a war to destroy peace in the Far East, then he will be finished soon! He is a half-paralyzed sick man trying to crush himself against the powerful forces of peace, and he won't be able to break them!
    Locomotive Driver of Locomotive No. 1939, Fengtai Locomotive Depot, Beijing, Labor Hero who created a safe driving record of 150,000 kilometers, Su Yinsheng
    If the American bandits dare to prevent us from liberating Taiwan, we will not be polite to them! Taiwan is ours, and we must liberate Taiwan!
                              Locomotive Driver of the Mao Zedong Locomotive, Labor Hero, Guo Linde

　　“中国人民是吓不倒的”
    ——劳动英雄们的声音
    我刚从国外回来。在匈牙利、捷克、波兰的各个工厂、学校里，我看见都挂着毛主席的像。世界上爱好和平的人民，都爱戴我们的毛主席！美国帝国主义想破坏远东和平，中国人民不答应他，全世界人民也不答应他！他敢动一动，就是自取灭亡。
                          一九三九号机车司机长  劳动英雄  李永禄
    杜鲁门是个骗子，也是个强盗！他骗不了人时，他就吓人。其实，他纯粹是个纸老虎，吓不了人的。中国人民是吓不倒的。
    杜鲁门就是真的发疯了，冒险发动战争，破坏远东和平，那么，他就快完蛋了！他是个半身不遂的病架子，向强大的和平力量上碰，还碰不碎它！
    北京丰台机务段一九三九号机车司机长  创十五万公里安全行走的劳动英雄  苏寅生
    如果美国强盗敢于阻止我们解放台湾，我们就对他不客气！台湾是我们的，我们一定得解放台湾！
                              毛泽东号机车司机  劳动英雄  郭林德
