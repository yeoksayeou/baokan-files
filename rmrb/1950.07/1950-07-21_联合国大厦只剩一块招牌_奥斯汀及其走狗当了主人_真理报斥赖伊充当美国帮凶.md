Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: TASS, Moscow, July 18th: *Pravda's* New York correspondents, Rasadin and Filippov, commented on UN Secretary-General Lie's activities regarding Korea, saying: On July 14th, Lie was late for a scheduled press conference held at Lake Success. Why was Lie late? To this question, one journalist in the lounge said, "Lie is very busy now; he is in contact with the State Department to prepare answers for the journalists' questions."

Such a sarcastic joke reflects the truth. Indeed, Lie attended the press conference with various prepared answers that had undoubtedly been approved by the Americans. Thus, a lackey of the U.S. State Department appeared before the journalists disguised as the UN Secretary-General.

Following Austin, Lie constantly repeated like a parrot: The Korean incident occurred because of... the "aggression" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Following Austin, he defended the pro-American fascist Syngman Rhee regime, calling it a "child of the United Nations"... The UN Secretary-General completely disregarded the facts. He repeated American propaganda over and over. The victory of the North Korean army, in Lie's view, is precisely... evidence of North Korean "aggression." Lie observes the Korean situation through American lenses. How can he understand and admire the heroic spirit of the Korean people fighting against foreign aggressors for the freedom and independence of their motherland! The development of the Korean situation has not fulfilled Washington's pre-determined plans. The Syngman Rhee army, trained by American officers, suffered a disastrous defeat against North Korea.

At this point, Austin hurriedly summoned Lie to help him. The obedient Lie immediately sent a batch of UN flags to MacArthur. Under the flag of this olive branch – a symbol of peace – American planes are leveling Korean cities and villages, massacring women and children, ravaging Korean land, and spreading death... But the American interventionists are not limited to committing these bandit crimes themselves; they also demand that their vassal states provide cannon fodder. In this matter, Lie was once again obedient. On July 14th, he sent a notification to the governments of some UN member states. This notification will be infamous for all time, becoming the most despicable and filthy document in the history of the United Nations (it is unnecessary to point out who instigated this telegram; everyone knows it very well). Lie called on them to send troops to Korea, especially the army.

Sadin and Filippov said that the UN Secretariat building at Lake Success only has a UN sign left. Austin and his lackeys dominate everything there.

### 联合国大厦只剩一块招牌  奥斯汀及其走狗当了主人  真理报斥赖伊充当美国帮凶

　　联合国大厦只剩一块招牌  奥斯汀及其走狗当了主人 
    真理报斥赖伊充当美国帮凶
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：真理报驻纽约记者拉萨丁和费利波夫评论联合国秘书长赖伊关于朝鲜的活动说：七月十四日，赖伊在成功湖举行的定期记者招待会开晚了。赖伊为什么来晚了呢？对于这一问题，休息室内有一位记者说：“赖伊现在很忙，他正在和国务院联系，才好回答记者的问题。”
    这样尖刻的玩笑却反映了真情。的确，赖伊是带着无疑地经过美国人核准的各种准备好了的问答，才来出席记者招待会的。这样，美国国务院的仆从便以联合国秘书长的假貌出现在记者之前。
    赖伊跟着奥斯汀，像鹦鹉学舌似地不断硬说：朝鲜事件的发生是因为……朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的“侵略”。他跟着奥斯汀，袒护亲美的法西斯李承晚政权，把它叫作“联合国的孩子”……。联合国秘书长完全是不顾事实的。他一遍又一遍地重复着美国的宣传。北朝鲜军队的胜利，在赖伊看来正是……北朝鲜“侵略”的证据。赖伊戴着美国眼镜来观察朝鲜事态，他怎么能理解和钦佩朝鲜人民为自己祖国的自由独立，对抗外国侵略者而战斗的英雄气概呢！朝鲜事态的发展并没有使华盛顿预定的计划如愿以偿。由美国军官训练。用来对付北朝鲜的李承晚军队遭到了惨败。
    到了这步田地，奥斯汀便急急忙忙地召赖伊来帮他的忙。唯命是从的赖伊立刻把一批联合国的旗帜送交麦克阿瑟。美国飞机就是在这橄榄树叶——和平的象征——的旗帜下，夷平朝鲜的城市和乡村，屠杀妇女和儿童，蹂躏朝鲜的土地并且散布死亡……。但是美国干涉者并不限于自己亲手进行强盗罪行，他们还要求他们的附庸国供给炮灰。在这事上，赖伊又再度唯命是听。在七月十四日，他向一些联合国会员国的政府发出通知。这个通知将会遗臭万年，成为联合国历史上最可鄙和污秽的文件（并无必要指出谁是这通电的主使人，任何人都很清楚地知道这一点）。赖伊号召它们派遣军队到朝鲜，特别是陆军。
    萨丁拉和费利波夫说，成功湖的联合国秘书处大厦，只剩下了一块联合国的招牌。奥斯汀和他的走卒们在那里主宰了一切。
