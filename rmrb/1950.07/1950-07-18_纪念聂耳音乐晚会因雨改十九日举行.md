The commemorative Nie Er concert and the inaugural meeting of the Xinghai Chorus, jointly organized by the Beijing literary and art circles, were originally scheduled to be held yesterday (the 17th). Because of rain, it could not be held as scheduled and it was decided to postpone it to 8 pm on the 19th of this month. The location is still the Zhongshan Park Music Hall. Tickets for the 17th will be valid for the 19th. If it rains on the 19th, it will be postponed accordingly.
