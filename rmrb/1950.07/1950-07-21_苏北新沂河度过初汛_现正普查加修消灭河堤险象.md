The newly constructed Xin沂 River levee, built by 570,000 civilian laborers last winter and spring, has successfully weathered its initial flood.

The river's capacity this year is 3,140 cubic meters per second. It is planned that during flood season, the river will accommodate 2,500 cubic meters per second of water discharged from the upper reaches of the Shu River via this river course, and 640 cubic meters per second of water discharged from the 沂 River. On the 4th of this month, heavy rains fell in the Huaiyin Special District, and on the 5th, the initial flood of the Xin沂 River arrived. After the Shu River rose, the total flow of the river was approximately 600 cubic meters per second, all of which flowed out through the Xin沂 River channel. The water depth was approximately 1.5 meters, the water flow was stable, and the water flowed smoothly. The water level has now receded.

After the rain and initial flood, there were many boundary ditches, sinkholes, and cracks on the river embankment. The southern dike of the west gate of Shuyang City collapsed 3 meters wide and more than 200 meters long due to the impact of the main current. However, the local people repaired it in time, and there were no accidents.

According to Vice Minister Qian of the East China Water Conservancy Department, the Xin沂 River project has the following dangerous factors: (1) Most of the Xin沂 River does not have a mid-channel, and if the dike construction is not solid, there is a risk of breaching. (2) The dikes on both rivers are 800 li long, and the project is arduous, inevitably leading to roughness. The ramming work on most of the river dikes is very poor. (3) The Zhai River water-constricting dam is only a temporary project due to the short construction time. (4) There are also loopholes in the planning. However, there are also safety factors: (1) The flood level and flood volume are estimated from the most serious situation. (2) Although the ramming work on the new dike is poor, the soil quality is good, mostly clay. (3) The river line selection is still good. (4) Most of the areas along the river are old liberated areas, with strong organizational forces for flood prevention and rescue.

In order to ensure that the Xin沂 River does not collapse, the Northern Jiangsu Flood Control Headquarters organized three inspection teams in late May to conduct in-depth inspections in sections. From June 15th to 20th, it mobilized 250,000 civilian laborers on a large scale to carry out processing works, with an estimated 3.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, which was basically completed on the 3rd of this month. After the initial flood, the Flood Control Headquarters decided to add ramming and repairs to the dikes on both sides of the Xin沂 River to completely eliminate boundary ditches, sinkholes, and loopholes, and consolidate the dike body. It also rushed to complete equipment preparation, added hydrological stations, repaired roads, rushed to erect more than 300 li of long-distance telephone lines, and repaired ships, strengthening traffic intelligence during the flood season. The masses in various districts and villages along the river have established flood control organizations, preparing to protect the dikes and provide disaster relief in order to win the battle against the major flood.

### 苏北新沂河度过初汛  现正普查加修消灭河堤险象

　　苏北新沂河度过初汛
    现正普查加修消灭河堤险象
    【本报讯】去冬今春五十七万民工筑成的新沂河河堤，已胜利度过初汛。
    该河今年容量为三千一百四十秒公方，计划在洪水时期可容纳上游沭河经由该河道泄水二千五百秒公方，沂河泄水六百四十秒公方。本月四日淮阴专区普降大雨，五日新沂河初汛即到。沭河上涨后，全河流量约六百秒公方，全部经新沂河道流出，水深约一点五公尺，水势平稳，水流通畅。现在水势已经下降。
    经过雨淋和初汛，河堤上界沟、陷塘、裂缝极多。沭阳城西关南堤，因受主流冲击，坡脚坍塌三公尺宽、二百多公尺长。但均经当地群众及时修复，没有出险。
    据华东水利部钱副部长谈，新沂河工程存在以下几个危险的因素：（一）新沂河大部分没有中泓，假如堤工不固，就有决口危险。（二）两河堤共长八百华里，工程艰巨，难免粗糙，大部河堤硪工很差。（三）宅河束水坝因时间短促，只是临时性工程。（四）计划也有疏漏的地方。但同时也存在着安全因素：（一）洪水位、洪水量是从最严重情况估计的。（二）新堤硪工虽差，但土质还好，大部是粘土。（三）河线选择尚好。（四）沿河大部是老解放区，有强大的组织力量防汛抢险。
    为确保新沂河不致溃决，苏北防汛指挥部，曾于五月下旬组织三个检查组，分段深入检查。并于六月十五日至二十日，先后动员二十五万民工大规模进行加工工程，预定三百六十余万土方，已于本月三日基本完成。初汛后，防汛指挥部又决定在新沂河两堤加硪添修，以彻底消灭界沟、陷塘、漏洞，巩固堤身。并突击完成器材准备工作，添设水文站、抢修公路，赶架三百余华里的长途电话线和赶修船只，加强防汛期间的交通情报。沿河各区村群众，均已成立防汛组织，准备护堤抢险，以胜战大汛。
