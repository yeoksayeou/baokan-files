　　American Imperialism's Conspiracy to Invade Taiwan

　　On June 18th, U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and State Department advisor Dulles arrived in Tokyo together to begin discussions with MacArthur. On June 22nd, during a press conference in Tokyo, Dulles revealed: "Although the U.S. government will not necessarily 'seize' military bases in Japan, it would seriously consider it if the Japanese government officially invited the U.S. military to remain stationed in Japan for military defense purposes." In the same setting, Dulles publicly declared: "Any consideration of U.S. policy toward Taiwan must remember that this policy is not immutable but is subject to constant and continuous review." (See Tokyo dispatches in the Christian Science Monitor, June 22nd and 23rd). This means that Truman's January 5th statement of "non-interference in Taiwan" was never "immutable." Dulles's remarks about Taiwan received widespread attention in American newspapers. Some newspapers, such as the Christian Science Monitor on June 24th, even headlined "Tokyo Talks Theme Shifts to Taiwan."
　　Three days before Dulles's press conference, a New York Times editorial revealed a new line of thought from American reactionaries regarding the Taiwan issue, which can serve as an explanation of Dulles's remarks. The editorial stated: "Retaining certain bases is necessary to defend Japan. In modern warfare, the outdated idea of three or four relatively isolated bases is of course meaningless. Once invaded, the entire Japanese archipelago can only constitute one base, and it's not even big enough. We must also be able to defend it and supply it. It is very likely for this reason that General MacArthur, according to recent reports, is preparing to promote a joint defense plan for the entire Western Pacific, not just Japan alone; in this way, the question of what should and can be done for Taiwan is raised again."
　　The editorial also said that this is a so-called "powerful defense plan based on the region, which will involve top-priority political decisions and will require us to change our position on Taiwan."
　　According to a June 27th New York Post report: "Before Johnson and Bradley went to Japan, the (U.S.) Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed on a Far East policy including the following two points: (1) Not to conclude a peace treaty with Japan within five years; (2) To take any necessary measures to prevent Taiwan from falling into Communist hands." The New York Herald Tribune on June 25th more clearly reported: "The U.S. State Department and General MacArthur have agreed that it is best to prevent Russian forces from capturing Taiwan."
　　The New York Times stated on June 27th: "In Washington, opinions are brewing on all sides... We should immediately establish a strong battle line from the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines, all the way to southwestern Oceania, and notify all relevant countries—namely the Soviet bloc: If they take any action in this area that we believe threatens our security, we will definitely settle accounts with them without compromise." The same report also said: "This opinion has been very seriously placed back in the realm of high-level policy discussions. It is very likely to become the decision resulting from President Truman's dilemma."
　　As for how much political and military risk the invasion of Taiwan involves, the warmongers have sought some far-fetched propaganda "basis" to prove that the risk is not great. Based on incomplete materials, there are roughly the following points:
　　The New York Times said on June 19th, "Taiwan can be defended, although it is a bit late now, but not too late." "The increasingly unstable weather conditions allow us to anticipate that there may not be an attempt to attack in the coming months."
　　The New York Herald Tribune claimed on June 27th: "It is said that General MacArthur has reached a certain conclusion that the Soviet Union will not launch a war in the next ten years."
　　The New York Herald Tribune reported on June 25th: "According to the opinion of the Allied Supreme Command, taking a firm stance on the Taiwan issue will have a 90% chance of preventing the Communists from invading the island, because the Chinese themselves are not prepared to clash with the military strength of the United States. Nothing can completely avoid risks. But... officials believe that the chances of saving Taiwan are good, and due to the island's strategic position, it is worth the risk."
　　Thus, "Headquarters officials firmly believe that if prompt action is taken according to the following guidelines, the Communists may not even dare to launch an attack on Taiwan. The United States should issue a strongly worded public statement stating that due to the Soviet Union's participation in Chinese military preparations and due to changes in the world situation, the final disposition of the former Japanese island of Taiwan must await the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Before the signing of the treaty, Taiwan will be administered by the United States or the United Nations. At the same time as issuing this statement, a large-scale military delegation should be dispatched, and a limited amount of equipment should be supplied. The amount of aid will be equivalent to that supplied to the Greek government to fight against the guerrillas. It has also been suggested that in addition to sending a military delegation, naval strength should be flaunted. One official believes: 'As long as an aircraft carrier appears, it will inevitably prevent the Communists from launching an attack on Taiwan for a long time to come'" (same source). The same report also revealed that the United States will also "demand" that the bandit army "stop attacking the mainland" while doing this.
　　From this, it can be seen that the determination of American imperialism to further seize Taiwan is not, as Truman hypocritically stated in his June 27th statement, due to the Korean War. From the above news, we can know that as early as the trip to Tokyo by Dulles, Johnson, and other warmongers, and even before that, the American ruling group already had a "plan in mind."

　　美国帝国主义侵略台湾的阴谋
    静波
    六月十八日美国国防部部长詹逊、联合参谋长布莱德雷、国务院顾问杜勒斯连袂抵东京，开始和麦克阿瑟商谈。六月二十二日，杜勒斯在东京举行记者招待会时透露：“虽然美国政府不一定会在日本‘攫取’军事基地，但日本官方如果邀请美军以军事防卫资格留守在日本，它是会加以慎重的考虑的。”在同一场合，杜勒斯公开声明：“美国对台湾政策的任何考虑，必须记住这种政策并不是一成不变的，而是受到经常和不断的检讨的。”（见基督教科学箴言报，六月二十二，二十三两日东京电讯）。这就是说，杜鲁门一月五日“不干涉台湾”的声明，本不是“一成不变”的。杜勒斯关于台湾的谈话，受到美国报纸的广泛注意。有些报纸，如二十四日基督教科学箴言报，甚至以“东京谈判主题转向台湾”为新闻标题。
    在杜勒斯的记者招待会召开前三天，纽约时报社论曾经透露美国反动集团对台湾问题的一条新的思想线索，恰恰可以作为杜勒斯谈话的解释。这社论说：“为了保卫日本而保留某种基地是必需的。现代战争中，那种三、四个相对地孤立的基地的陈旧思想当然是毫无意义了。一旦被侵略，整个日本群众岛必然只能构成一个基地，而且还不够大。我们还必须能够保卫它，供应它。很可能正是为了这样的理由，麦克阿瑟将军，据最近报导，准备促成一个西太平洋全体的，而不单是日本一国的联合防御计划；这样，就重新提起了应该以及能够为台湾做些什么事的问题。”
    这社论又说，这是一个所谓“一个以区域为基础的有力的防御计划，将会涉及头等重要的政治决策，它会要我们改变对台湾的立场。”
    据六月二十七日纽约邮报消息：“在詹逊与布莱德雷赴日以前，（美国）联合参谋部就同意了包括以下两点的远东政策：（一）五年之内不和日本订和约；（二）采取防止台湾陷入共党之手的任何必要措施。”六月二十五日纽约先锋论坛报更明确地报道：“美国国务院与麦克阿瑟将军已同意：阻止俄国势力攻陷台湾，乃是上策。”
    六月二十七日纽约时报称：“在华盛顿方面，各方的意见正在酝酿中。……我们应该马上从阿留申群岛、日本、台湾、冲绳岛、以及菲律宾，一直到大洋洲西南部，建立一条强大的战线，同时通知一切有关的国家——即苏联集团：如果他们在这一区域里采取我们认为威胁到我们的安全的任何行动，我们一定会不折不扣地向他们算账的。”同一消息又说：“这种意见已经很认真地被再次放在高级政策讨论的领域里面。它很可能成为杜鲁门总统进退两难地位中所产生出来的决策。”
    至于侵台究竟包含多少政治上与军事上的风险，战争贩子们寻找了一些很牵强的宣传的“根据”，证明风险不大。根据不完全的材料，大致有下列的几点：
    六月十九日纽约时报说，“台湾是可以守住的，虽然现在是迟了一些，但是还不太迟。”“气候情况的愈加不稳，使我们现在能预料在最近几个月里，可能不致有进攻的尝试。”
    六月二十七日纽约先锋论坛报称：“据说麦克阿瑟将军已获得某种结论，即今后十年内苏联不会发动战争。”
    六月二十五日纽约先锋论坛报讯：“据盟军最高统帅部的意见，美国对台湾问题采取坚决立场，将有百分之九十的把握阻止共产党对该岛的侵略，因为中国人自己并没有准备与美国的军力发生冲突。任何事情都不可能完全避免风险。但是……官员们相信，拯救台湾的机会是良好的，并且由于该岛的战略地位，也值得冒险。”
    于是，“总部官员坚信：如果根据下面的方针采取迅速行动的话，共产党人可以甚至不敢发动对台湾的攻击。美国应该发表一个措辞强硬的公开声明，说明由于苏联之参加中国军事准备工作以及由于世界局势的变迁，因此对于前属日本的台湾岛的最后处置问题，必须等待对日和约的签订。在和约签订前，台湾将由美国或联合国代管。与发表这一声明的同时，应该派遣一个大规模的军事代表团，并供应有限度的装备。援助的数量将与供给希腊政府与游击队作战者相当。也有人建议，在派遣军事代表团之外，应该将海军实力炫示一番。某官员认为：‘只要出现一艘航空母舰，就必然会使共产党人在未来很长一段时间内不敢发动对台湾的攻击’”（同上消息）。同一消息又透露，美国干这一手的同时，也要“要求”匪军“停止进攻大陆”。
    由此可见，美帝进一步攫夺台湾的决心，决不像杜鲁门假惺惺地在其六月二十七日声明中所说是由于朝鲜战争所引起的。从以上消息中，我们可以知道，早在杜勒斯、詹逊等战争贩子东京之行的时候，甚至在这以前，美国统治集团已经“胸有成竹”了。（附图片）
