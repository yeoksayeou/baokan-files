　　If the enemy doesn't get out, destroy them!
　　Ruan Zhangjing
　　The world's forces for peace and democracy are growing stronger; the various nations of the East are standing up like giants!
　　Truman, the head of the US imperialism, the leader of the imperialist camp, was panic-stricken and bit wildly. Now he has torn off his last fig leaf and is nakedly invading the Korean people! And he has arrogantly ordered the armed obstruction of China's liberation of Taiwan and interference in the liberation movements of Vietnam and the Philippines!
　　American imperialist planes are bombing and strafing the elderly, children, and women of Korea! They are massacring peaceful residents! American imperialism, in the Security Council it controls, is stealing its name and staging a shameless "flag-giving" farce. The once solemn blue and white flag, now defiled by American imperialism, is being carried to kill people!
　　The Chinese people, who defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that was fostered and armed by American imperialism, are not afraid of this paper tiger that scurried out of mainland China! If Truman insists on preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, the Chinese people will not stint their iron fists and will surely knock the pirates into the vast ocean!
　　The Chinese people support and aid the Korean brothers and Asian nations who are fighting for the liberation of their homeland with utmost concern.
　　Brave Korean brothers, you fight well! The glorious descendants of Eulji Mundeok, Kang Gam-chan, and Yi Sun-sin, heroes who fought against Japanese imperialism for forty years with unyielding spirit, are today giving the invaders a head-on blow, beating them to a pulp!
　　Brave Korean brothers, you understand that the struggle ahead is arduous, so you will fight even better! As a poet, a participant in the battle, and an eyewitness, I can testify: during our War of Resistance Against Japan, we spent arduous years together in the mountains and plains of Northeast and North China. In the winter of 1941, the barbaric Japanese fascist army, with powerful armed forces, attacked the gateway to the Taihang Mountains, the Xianwengzhai militia in Yuanshi County, which persisted in the border struggle. The situation was serious. The heroic Korean sons and daughters—the Korean Volunteer Army—who had just arrived, immediately launched a fierce battle, and we jointly repelled the enemy. In the summer of 1942, the Japanese fascist army launched several "mopping-up" operations in the Taihang Mountains, and fierce battles were fought on the mountains near Matian and Qingta with an enemy more than ten times our size. Our heroic sons and daughters and the heroic sons and daughters of Korea fought together and shed blood together! Standing on the majestic Taihang Mountains, the tombstones of great internationalists such as Chen Guanghua and other Korean heroes mark that our friendship is deep-rooted and connected by flesh and blood.
　　We know how to defeat the vicious enemies of the past, and we know even better how to defeat the barbaric enemies of today! We know how to face difficulties, and we know even better how to achieve victory!
　　Today, the people of our country, from the cities to the border areas, from the factories to the fields, are all voicing their angry voices: If the invaders do not get out of Korea, destroy them!
　　The American imperialist aggression against Korea shows that the giant wave of world peace and democracy has shocked this hideous and hateful crocodile, causing it to be scattered and thrown onto the scorching beach, jumping around and making a fool of itself in front of the eyes of all mankind!
　　Victory belongs to the righteous Korean people, to the Asian people, and to the peace-loving people of the world.

　　敌人不滚出去，就消灭它！
    阮章竞
    世界和平民主势力日益壮大；东方各个民族像巨人般地站起来了！
    帝国主义阵营中为首的美帝国主义的头子——杜鲁门，惊慌失色，乱抓乱咬。现在又把最后的一片遮羞布扯下，赤裸裸地向朝鲜人民进犯了！并狂妄地下令武装阻止中国解放台湾和干涉越南、菲律宾的解放运动！
    美帝国主义的飞机在轰炸、扫射朝鲜的老人、儿童和妇女！在虐杀和平居民！美帝国主义在他所把持下的安理会上，盗窃名义，演出无耻的“授旗”丑剧。曾经是庄严的蓝白旗帜，现在被美帝国主义奸污之后，被扛着去杀人了！
    战胜了日本帝国主义、战胜了美帝国主义豢养与武装起来的蒋介石匪帮的中国人民，绝不怕这只狼狈窜出中国大陆的纸老虎！杜鲁门硬要阻止中国人民解放台湾，中国人民决不会吝啬他的铁拳，一定要把海盗打落在汪洋大海！
    中国人民以无比的关切支持援助为自己祖国解放而战斗的朝鲜兄弟和亚洲民族。
    英勇的朝鲜兄弟，打得好！曾经和日本帝国主义进行了四十年不屈不挠的斗争的光荣的乙支文德、姜感赞、李舜臣等英雄的后代，今天给予进犯者以迎头痛击，打得他落花流水！
    英勇的朝鲜兄弟，你们懂得面前的斗争是严酷的，因此你们将会打得更好！我以诗歌工作者、战斗的参加者与目击者来见证：在我国抗日战争中，在东北、华北的高山和原野，我们曾共同度过艰苦的年月。一九四一年的冬天，野蛮的日本法西斯军队，以强大的武装，向太行山的门户，向坚持边地斗争的元氏仙翁寨民兵进攻，情况是严重的。刚才开到的英勇的朝鲜儿女——朝鲜义勇军，立即展开勇猛的战斗，我们共同打退了敌人。一九四二年的夏天，日本法西斯军队，数路“扫荡”太行山区，在麻田、青塔附近的山上，和十数倍于我的敌人，展开了激烈的战斗。我国的英勇儿女和朝鲜的英勇儿女，一起打过仗，一起流过血！矗立在巍峨的太行山巅，伟大的国际主义者——陈光华等朝鲜英雄的墓碑，标志着我们的友谊是深固的，是血肉相连的。
    我们懂得怎样战胜过去的凶恶的敌人，我们更懂得怎样战胜今天的野蛮的敌人！我们懂得怎样迎接困难，我们更懂得怎样去取得胜利！
    今天我国人民，从城市到边疆，从工厂到田野，都在发出愤怒的声音：侵略者不滚出朝鲜去，就消灭他！
    美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜，正表示世界和平民主的巨浪，把这条狰狞可恶的鳄鱼，冲击得魂飞魄散，卷上灼热的沙滩，乱蹦乱跳，在全世界人类的眼底下，现形出丑！
    胜利是属于正义的朝鲜人民的，是属于亚洲人民和世界的和平人类的。
