　　Self-Criticism on "Jin Suo"
    Zhao Shuli
    The third and fourth issues of "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" published a novella by Shu Chi entitled "Jin Suo." The author made incorrect descriptions of peasants. As the editor, I did not accept the opinions of other editorial board members to revise the potentially correctable parts. As a result, after its publication, it elicited many opinions from people in literary circles and other readers. After receiving this feedback, I made a self-criticism and defense in the 17th issue of "Wenyi Bao" (entitled "Before and After the Publication of Jin Suo"), but the self-criticism was not detailed enough, and the defense was not accurate enough. I now feel it is necessary to re-examine it.

    I. Self-Criticism of the "Self-Criticism"

    In my original self-criticism, although I mentioned that the original work "partially proceeded from a sense of entertainment, thus damaging the selection and criticism of things," and that this was the author's mistake, I only mentioned it briefly and let it go lightly. The reason was that I focused on criticizing myself and was unwilling to push the mistake onto the author. At that time, my view of the original work was:

    From the main content of this novella, it is nothing more than "a wandering refugee, stranded in the home of a local bully landlord as a hired laborer. The bully landlord owes him wages and does not pay him, and also uses public grain to deceive another female refugee, nominally to marry him as his wife, but in reality with ulterior motives. Later, because she resisted rape, he killed both the man and the woman. Unexpectedly, the man did not die and joined the People's Liberation Army, finally clarifying the case." If written in a proper manner, this subject matter would not have major problems (slightly formulaic), but unfortunately the author felt it was insufficient and deliberately uglified the protagonist (hired laborer), and added some low-level趣味parts that had nothing but sex appeal to make it more interesting, resulting in the partial deterioration of this piece.

    This was my original understanding of this novella. The inadequacy of the original self-criticism was that it did not see the "selection of things" as a matter of stance—thinking that the sarcasm of "Jin Suo" himself was merely a matter of unselective "language" and "tone." Now it seems that this is very incorrect. This is actually a matter of "stance." The author subjectively wanted to speak for the working people, but because life, thought, and emotion were somewhat detached from the working people (although the author originally came from a peasant family), he could not treat the affairs of the working people as his own family's affairs. For example, after introducing the Cao family's "donkey house" at the beginning of the novella (this term also has problems, and should not confuse clan with class), it then says, "Although Jin Suo also bore the surname Cao, he was not a 'donkey' family of proper descent..." This is equivalent to saying: "This bastard and that group of bastards are both bastards, but they are of different kinds." This tone, runs throughout the whole article, making people wonder which side the author is on.

    II. Self-Criticism of the Defense

    There are many places in my defense that need to be self-criticized. Now, let me mention two important ones:

    1. Many people pointed out that this novella "is an insult to the working people," and my defense said "no." Everyone is right, and I am wrong. Putting the bully landlord and the peasants on an equal footing, sarcastically scolding them all the way down, can it still be said that it is not an insult to the working people?

    2. Saying that "some people who write about the countryside...idealize all peasants, so I chose a more realistic work as a reference" is also wrong. The idea that guided me to make this defense was that I had the burden of being familiar with the countryside. At that time, among the manuscripts received, there were several "…turnover stories," but unfortunately they all seemed like news, and I could not see the life of the countryside. After seeing "Jin Suo," I felt that many of the things written in it were quite similar to the things I already had in my mind, so I said it was a "more realistic work," and wanted to ask others to use it as a reference. Thinking carefully: If others really refer to this style of ridiculing peasants to write things, wouldn't they all be ridiculing peasants? Because I had the burden of being familiar with the countryside, I always felt that the stereotyped conceptualized works were annoying in my feelings; I did not realize that, although concepts or stereotypes are not good, but if the writer sincerely sings the praises of the working people, and if I know a little more than others, I should put forward my opinions for others to refer to, why should I think that other people's works are "annoying"?

    III. Retention of the Defense and Self-Criticism in the Retention

    One problem I am worried about is how people who work in rural areas treat the layer of people who flow into the lower classes after bankruptcy. This layer of people is still discriminated against in some villages that have undergone land reform. For example, when encountering happy or sad events, the villagers still feel ashamed to sit down and eat with them. When I wrote "Fu Gui," it was specifically to solve this problem. "Fu Gui"'s early experiences were no better than "Jin Suo"'s. If we only sarcastically dig at him from the "phenomenon," I am afraid it would be even uglier than "Jin Suo." In my defense, I said that they can't afford to talk about "bones" just means "can't afford to talk about," not that they "don't have" them; saying that "people with some social status" can afford to talk about it refers to people who are slightly stronger than "Jin Suo" and with whom people in society are willing to talk to, and not to people who can squeeze to the side of the landlord. My analysis of this layer of people is still considered to be not too wrong, but if I were to elect peasant representatives, I would not elect them before doing appropriate work.

    Whether this paragraph of analysis is right or wrong (if wrong, we will study it again), writing it in the defense can only be regarded as sophistry. Because the main theme of the novella "Jin Suo" is not to solve that problem at all. According to this statement, we can draw the conclusion in the last paragraph of the original defense: "...The biggest defect in the treatment of Jin Suo is that he did not write about his progress..." Is that really the case? If we add his progress, should it be one or two chapters? Can adding the progress revoke the mistakes in the previous stance? Obviously, it is inappropriate.

    IV. Understanding of the Author

    Finally, I still believe that the author has special conditions for writing about the countryside: familiarity with life, fluent and popular language, as long as he undergoes considerable political study, he will definitely be able to write good works.

### 对《金锁》问题的检讨

　　对《金锁》问题的检讨
    赵树理
    “说说唱唱”第三第四两期上，发表了淑池一篇题名《金锁》的小说。作者对于农民作了不正确的描写。我在编辑的时候，没有接受其他编委的意见，来把可能改正的地方改正。以致发表出去之后，引出文艺界同人和其他读者好多意见。我收到这些反映后，曾在《文艺报》第十七期上作了检讨和辩护（题名《金锁发表前后》），但检讨得不够详尽，辩护得不够正确。我现在感觉有重新来检讨一下的必要。
    一、对“检讨”的检讨
    我在原来的检讨中，虽然也曾提到原作是“局部地从趣味出发，因而损害了对事物的选择和批判”，也曾提到这是作者的错误，可是只那么略略提到，轻轻放过，其原因是着重检讨自己，不愿多把错误向作者身上推。我在那时对原作的看法是这样的：
    从这篇小说的主要内容上看，也不过是“一个流浪的难民，流落在一家恶霸地主家里当长工。恶霸地主欠下他的工资不给，又用公家的粮食骗来了另外一个女难民，名义上是替他这个长工娶妻，实质上别有用心，后来因强奸不从，竟将男女一同治死。不料男的没有死去，投入解放军，最后把案情弄明了。”要是正正派派写，这个题材没有多大毛病（略有点公式化），可惜作者嫌它不足，故意把主角（长工）丑化了，又加上些除了色情再无其他的低级趣味部分来凑趣，竟弄得这篇东西局部地变了质。
    这便是我原来对这篇小说的认识。原检讨中不足之处是没有把“对事物的选择”问题看成立场问题——以为对“金锁”本人的挖苦只是“语言”“口吻”的无选择。现在看来，这一点是非常不正确的。这实际上是一个“立场”问题。作者主观上是要替劳动人民说话的，可是因为生活、思想、感情与劳动人民有些脱离（虽然作者原来是农民家庭出身），因而就不能把劳动人民的事当做自己一家人的事来讲。例如：小说中一开始介绍了曹家的“驴宅”（这个词也有毛病，不应把宗族和阶级混为一谈）之后，接着便说“金锁这个人虽然也姓过曹，却不是‘驴’家的正支正派………”这就等于说：“这个忘八蛋与那一伙忘八蛋虽然都是忘八蛋，可是不同种”。这种口吻，贯注于全篇，使人读了不知道作者是站在那一方面说话。
    二、对辩护的检讨
    我的辩护中需要检讨之处甚多，现在先举两条重要的：
    １、好多人指出这篇小说“是对劳动人民的侮辱”，我的辩护说“不是”。大家是对的，我是错误的。把恶霸地主和农民平列起来，一列地挑着眼用俏皮话骂下去，还能说不是侮辱劳动人民吗？
    ２、说“有些写农村的人………把一切农民理想化了，所以才选一篇比较现实的作品来作个参照”也是错的。指导我作这样辩护的思想是自己有个熟悉农村的包袱。当时收到的稿件中，“………翻身记”就有好几篇，可惜都好像新闻，看不出农村的生活，而看到《金锁》之后，觉着其中写到的事物有不少地方和我自己观念中已有的事物都相差不多，因此就说它是“比较现实的作品”，还要叫给别人作个参照。仔细一想：别人如果真的参照了这个讥讽农民的风格来写东西，不是都讥讽起农民来了吗？因为自己有了熟悉农村这个包袱，在感情上总觉着千篇一律的概念化的作品讨厌；没有认识到，只有概念或千篇一律固然不好，但是写的人主观上诚诚恳恳的歌颂劳动人民，自己如果比人家多知道一点什么，应该把自己的意见提出来给人家作个参考，为什么要以为人家的作品“讨厌”呢？
    三、对辩护的保留与保留中的检讨
    我所担心的一个问题是作农村工作的人怎样对待破产后流入下流社会那一层人的问题。这一层人在有些经过土改的村子还是被歧视的。例如遇了红白大事，村里人都还以跟他们坐在一块吃饭为羞。我写“福贵”那时候，就是专为解决这个问题。“福贵”的前期遭遇并不比“金锁”好，假如只从“现象”上挖苦起来，恐怕要比“金锁”还难看。我在辩护中说，他们讲不起“骨头”只是说“讲不起”，并非说他“没有”；说“多少有点社会地位的人”才讲得起，指的是比“金锁”稍强一点，在社会上还有人愿意跟他谈话的人，而并非指什么能挤到地主边上的人。我对这一层人的分析还认为没有大错，不过要是选举农民代表，当未作过适当工作之前我可也不选他们。
    这一段分析不论对与错（错了再研究），写在辩护中也只能算是狡辩。因为《金锁》这篇小说根本不是以解决那个问题为主题的。根据这种说法推论下来，就得出原辩护中末一段的结论：“………对金锁这个人物的处理，最大的缺陷是没有写出他进步的过程……”其实是这样吗？假如补出他的进步过程来，该算一篇呀该算两篇？补出进步过程来就能把前边立场上的错误撤销了吗？显然是不妥的。
    四、对作者的认识
    最后，我仍认为作者具有写农村的特殊条件：生活熟悉、文字通俗流利，只要经过相当的政治学习，一定是能写出好的作品来的。
