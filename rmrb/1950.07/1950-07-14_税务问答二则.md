Two Tax Questions and Answers
    (1) Question: I purchased several tons of scrap iron in Luoyang, intending to transport it elsewhere. However, I was unable to transport it because I hadn't paid the goods tax. Yet, scrap iron purchased in North China and Northeast China is exempt from tax. I wonder if the Luoyang tax bureau is collecting the tax incorrectly?
                              (Li Jianzhang)
    Answer: According to government regulations, iron tax should be levied when the iron is smelted (or leaves the factory). Those who use scrap iron to refine iron should also be taxed when it is re-smelted. It is incorrect for tax authorities in individual regions to levy the tax on scrap iron before it is re-smelted. The State Taxation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Finance has issued a notice to tax bureaus in various regions to correct this. (State Taxation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Finance)
    (2) Question: On June 7th, I transported twelve reams of newspapers to Tianjin. Because the "Purchase Certificate" was not affixed with a stamp, the Sanjianfang inspection station in Tongxian fined me thirty times the amount. May I ask whether a "Purchase Certificate" for stationary merchants should be affixed with a stamp?
                                             (Duan Fengde)
    Answer: "Purchase Certificates" for stationary merchants do not require a stamp. Because the past tax laws were not clear enough, the comrades at the Sanjianfang inspection station in Tongxian considered it a type of certificate, requiring a stamp and imposing a fine. This is incorrect. In addition to the State Taxation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Finance notifying the Hebei Provincial Tax Bureau to instruct the inspection station to refund the full amount of the fine, Mr. Duan Fengde is requested to take his fine receipt to the station to collect the refund.

　　税务问答二则
    （一）问：我在洛阳购得废生铁数吨，准备他运，结果因未纳货物税不得起运，但我在华北、东北所购得之废铁则可免税，不知洛阳税局是否错征？
                              （李建章）
    答：依照政府规定：铁税应于冶炼出炉（或出厂）时征收；以废铁炼铁者，亦应于重新冶炼出炉时进行课征。个别地区税务机关不俟废铁重新冶炼即行课征是不对的。中央财政部税务总局已通令各地税局改正。（中央财政部税务总局）
    （二）问：六月七日我运往天津报纸十二令，因“购货证”未贴印花，被通县三间房检查站发觉，处以三十倍罚金。请问座商“购货证”是否应贴印花？
                                             （段凤德）
    答：座商“购货证”是不贴印花的。由于过去税法上规定不够明确，故通县三间房检查站同志，认为系一种凭证，即令贴花，并予处罚，这是不对的。除由中央财政部税务总局通知河北省税务局转达该检查站将罚款如数退还外，请段凤德君持罚款收据，到该站将罚款领回。（中央财政部税务总局）
