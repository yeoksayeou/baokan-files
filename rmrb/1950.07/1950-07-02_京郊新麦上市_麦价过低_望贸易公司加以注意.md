　　New Wheat from Beijing Suburbs Enters the Market
    Wheat Prices Too Low
    Hoping Trading Companies Will Pay Attention
    To the Editor:
    The wheat harvest in the suburbs has basically ended. After the wheat entered the market, the price of wheat was even cheaper than corn. Farmers are unwilling to sell. Some are eating three meals of refined grains a day, while others urgently need money and have no choice but to sell at low prices, suffering considerable losses. The 19th District Cooperative, seeing this situation, requested instructions from the head office based on the demands of the masses and began purchasing in various villages. There are three methods of purchase: First, "exchange coarse grains for fine grains": one jin and five liang of Northeast corn, or one jin and six liang of Northeast sorghum, or one jin and ten liang of Northeast millet can be exchanged for one jin of wheat. Another method is to purchase through cooperative business, that is, farmers can use wheat to exchange for various necessities at the cooperative's pricing. The third method is to purchase with money, but the quantity does not exceed 50% of the total. The purchase price is based on the price in Beixin'an Town. If the wheat price in Beixin'an Town is higher than the prices in nearby areas, it will be purchased according to the price in that town; if it is lower than the prices in nearby areas, the purchase price will be raised. It is said that the wheat prices in Changxindian, Nanyuan and other places are also very low. This situation is very detrimental to the rural economy. It is hoped that state-owned trading organizations will pay attention.

　　京郊新麦上市
    麦价过低
    望贸易公司加以注意编辑同志：
    郊区麦收已基本结束。小麦上市以后，麦价比玉米还贱。农民不愿出卖，有的每天吃三顿细粮，有的急需钱用，只好忍痛贱价出卖，吃亏不小。十九区合作社见到这种情况，根据群众要求请示总社后，开始在各村收购。收购办法有三：一是“以粗换细”：以东北玉米一斤五两或东北高粮一斤六两或东北谷子一斤十两换小麦一斤。另一办法是通过合作社营业来收购，即农民可以用小麦按照合作社定价换购各种必需品。第三个办法是用钱收购，但数量不超过总数的百分之五十。收购价格以北辛安镇牌价为标准。如北辛安镇麦价较附近各区价格为高，则照该镇价格收购；如较附近各地为低，则提高收购价格。听说长辛店、南苑等地麦价亦甚低廉。这种情况对于农村经济非常不利。希望公营贸易机构加以注意。
