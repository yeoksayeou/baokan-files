　　On Issues Concerning the Korean War
　　I. What kind of country is Korea? Briefly, what is its geography and history?
　　Korea is a newly emerging people's democratic country after the war, facing our Shandong Province across the sea, bordering our Liaodong and Jilin provinces to the north, and bordering the Far East region of the Soviet Union to the northeast. The country has an area of 220,840 square kilometers, roughly equivalent to our Hunan Province, and a total population of about 30 million, roughly equivalent to our Hebei Province. Korea has a long history of more than 4,000 years. In history, it has defeated four large-scale invasions by foreign tribes, namely the invasion of millions by Emperor Yang of Sui in 612 AD, the invasion of 300,000 by Emperor Taizong of Tang in 644 AD, the invasion of 800,000 by the Khitans in 994 AD, and the invasion of 200,000 by Japan from 1592 to 1598. In 1895 and 1905, the actively expanding Japanese imperialism defeated the corrupt Manchu Qing government and the Tsarist Russian government, and with the collusion of Korean traitors, formally annexed Korea in 1910 (i.e., the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty), enslaving the Korean people for 36 years. In August 1945, the great Soviet army liberated Korea from Japanese enslavement, opening up a bright path for the Korean people to become masters of their own country. However, the US imperialists used the temporary division of the 38th parallel during the war to support reactionary forces in the area south of 38 degrees north latitude, splitting Korea and effectively turning southern Korea into a US colony after the war.
　　II. How was the Democratic People's Republic of Korea established, and what is its general situation?
　　The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was legitimately established on the basis of universal suffrage by all the Korean people. After the US representative twice disrupted the meetings of the Soviet-American Joint Committee in March 1946 and May 1947, it staged a divisive "election" in South Korea on May 10, 1948, creating the "Republic of Korea" and the Syngman Rhee puppet government.
　　In order to oppose the US policy of division and to establish a genuine supreme organ of power for all the Korean people, leaders of political parties and organizations in South and North Korea held a consultation meeting on June 29, 1948, and decided to hold a genuine universal election throughout Korea on August 25 of the same year to elect the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea and establish a unified national central government. In this universal election, despite the brutal suppression by the US-Rhee military police, 77.52 percent of the voters in South Korea still cast their votes. In North Korea, 99.97 percent of the voters enthusiastically cast their votes. This genuine national election produced the Supreme People's Assembly, composed of 572 representatives. On September 8, 1948, the first session of the Supreme People's Assembly passed the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, announced the birth of the Republic, and elected a central government headed by General Kim Il-sung.
　　After the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it inherited the achievements of various democratic reforms and economic constructions of the North Korean People's Committee, and vigorously launched construction work in the northern region of the Republic, achieving remarkable results. The two-year economic plan implemented in 1949 resulted in the industrial production of the northern half of the Republic last year increasing to 377.1 percent of that in 1946. In agriculture, although last year was an unusually dry year, grain production still increased by 626,000 tons compared to 1944. Before the outbreak of the war, the Korean people were striving to complete the second year of the two-year economic plan ahead of schedule.
　　III. What is the "38th Parallel"?
　　The "38th Parallel" refers to the 38 degrees north latitude line. In August 1945, the heroic Soviet army was the first to enter Korea after defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army and the Korean Garrison Army. The US military landed at Incheon Port on September 8, three weeks after Japan's surrender. At that time, the Soviet and US military authorities, in accordance with the agreement, used the 38 degrees north latitude line as the boundary, respectively occupying the northern and southern halves of Korea, in order to disarm the Japanese army. Therefore, the "38th Parallel" was purely a temporary measure during the war and had no other significance. However, the US occupiers violated the Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference decision on granting Korea freedom and independence, and used this temporary division to split Korea and obstruct the unification of the motherland unanimously demanded by all the Korean people.
　　IV. What is the South Korean puppet government?
　　The so-called "Republic of Korea Government" of Syngman Rhee in South Korea is an anti-national and anti-people regime supported by US imperialism with bayonets. This "government" was created by the US occupiers and the so-called United Nations Korean Commission through separate and illegal "elections" on May 10, 1948. In this "election", although all the voters in South Korea were forced by bayonets, less than 30 percent of them went to vote. And in the results of the fake election on May 30 this year, Syngman Rhee's Great Korean Nationalist Party only occupied 22 seats out of its total of 210 National Assembly seats, and even with the party members it controlled, it was only 45 seats. It can be seen that the so-called "Republic of Korea Government" not only completely cannot represent the Korean people, but is also only a small fraction of a small group of reactionaries. A June 25 Tokyo dispatch from the Associated Press, quoting the remarks made by so-called "qualified observers," had to admit: "If it were not for the United States, there would be no Syngman Rhee's Republic of Korea at all. South Korea was actually established by the United States." Under the four years of rule by the Syngman Rhee clique, South Korea has become a terrifying hell and slaughterhouse. The Syngman Rhee clique has massacred a total of 150,000 patriotic people, arrested 478,000 patriots, and disbanded 162 patriotic political parties and social organizations in four years. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique sold all the political, economic, and military sovereignty of South Korea to the United States, causing South Korea's economy to fall into bankruptcy and the people's lives to be extremely difficult. In 1949, the total number of enterprises in South Korea shrank to only 36 percent of that in 1943, the cultivated land area shrank to only 55 percent of that before the war, and prices rose by 821 to 1,003 times compared to before the war.
　　V. How did US imperialism interfere in Korean internal affairs and prepare for civil war after the war?
　　After the US troops landed at Incheon Port on September 8, 1945, they first dissolved the people's power organs—People's Committees—in various parts of South Korea and supported Korean national traitors and pro-Japanese elements to take power. In December of the same year, the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference decided to establish a Soviet-American Joint Committee to assist Korean democratic parties in organizing a provisional democratic government. However, at the two meetings of the committee in March 1946 and May 1947, the US representative disrupted the committee's meeting and rejected the Soviet representative's proposal at the second meeting that the Soviet and US troops withdraw simultaneously. In September 1947, the United States unilaterally submitted the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly and illegally established the "United Nations Korean Commission" by using the majority it manipulated, attempting to cover up its aggression with the signboard of the United Nations. On May 10, 1948, the United States implemented a separate divisive "election" and created a "Republic of Korea." On September 10, 1948, the first session of the Supreme People's Assembly elected by all the Korean people in the universal election proposed to the United States and the Soviet Union that the two countries withdraw their troops simultaneously and let the Korean people solve the country's reunification problem themselves. The Soviet government immediately agreed to this request and completed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in December 1948. The US government refused this request and did not announce the withdrawal of troops until the end of June 1949, but still left behind a military advisory group of 500 people and equipment worth 110 million yuan.
　　In order to prepare for the Korean civil war, US imperialism gave the Syngman Rhee clique 730 million yuan in "economic assistance" and "military assistance," and used its huge military advisory group to train and equip 100,000 puppet troops and 50,000 police in South Korea, and built naval bases such as Incheon, Busan, and Mokpo, and air force bases such as Daejeon, Daegu, and Gimpo. After US imperialism considered that it had completed its preparations, it instructed the Syngman Rhee puppet army to launch this war.
　　VI. Who provoked this Korean War?
　　This Korean War was provoked by the Syngman Rhee puppet army under the instructions of US imperialism. The Syngman Rhee puppet national defense army launched a surprise attack on the entire "38th Parallel" at dawn on June 25, dividing its forces into three routes and invading North Korea by one to two kilometers.
　　The sudden attack by the Syngman Rhee puppet army was prepared for a long time. From January last year to April this year, the Syngman Rhee puppet army launched 1,274 attacks on the "38th Parallel." Between April and May this year, Syngman Rhee gathered five of its eight puppet national defense army divisions along the "38th Parallel" and shouted wildly that "the north must be conquered in 1950." Bai Xingyu, the puppet interior minister, even blatantly stated the timing of the invasion: "The 38th Parallel issue must be resolved between June and July this year."
　　The attack by the Syngman Rhee puppet army was the direct result of instructions from the American aggressors. Johnson, director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's "Korean Branch," publicly testified in the US Congress on May 19 this year that "the 100,000 officers and soldiers of South Korea, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American military advisory group, have completed their preparations and can fight at any time." And the day after US Secretary of Defense Johnson and Chief of Staff Bradley left Tokyo, and five days after State Department Senior Advisor Dulles "inspected" the 38th Parallel, the Syngman Rhee clique issued a "top secret order" to implement a full-scale offensive on the 25th.
　　Someone asked: Since Syngman Rhee provoked this war, why is he suffering such a big defeat? This is because the reactionaries often overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. The United States and Syngman Rhee only saw that their preparations were mature, but they did not see that they were outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and they did not expect that the strength of North Korea was so strong, and that they would implement a counterattack this time. This is the same reason why Chiang Kai-shek attacked the People's Liberation Areas four years ago but resulted in his own demise, but Syngman Rhee is even more corrupt and incompetent. People all know that the United States declared that it would participate in the war to defeat North Korea, but the result was also its continuous retreat. It can be seen that the intentions of the reactionaries are one thing, but the actual results are another.
　　VII. Why did US imperialism launch an armed invasion of Korea?
　　The reason why US imperialism launched an armed invasion of Korea was to seize the entire Korea, attempting to establish an anti-people puppet regime in the entire Korea, deprive the Korean nation of independence, freedom, and unity, so as to turn the entire Korea into a US colony and a springboard for US aggression on the eastern border of China and the Soviet Union.
　　VIII. Why is the United Nations Security Council's resolution on Korea illegal?
　　Because the Security Council's recent series of resolutions on intervention in Korea have all grossly violated the United Nations Charter. According to Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations," and prohibits "the United Nations from intervening in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." And the Korean people rising up to overthrow the Syngman Rhee clique that launched the civil war and realize the independence and reunification of the motherland is obviously a domestic affair of the Korean people. At the same time, according to Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter, "Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters than procedural shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of all the permanent members." However, the resolution on armed intervention in Korea passed by the Security Council on June 27 was passed with only six votes (the vote of the Nationalist Party representative was illegal), and two of the five permanent members—the Soviet Union and China—did not attend the meeting and opposed this resolution. Therefore, the Security Council's resolution is completely illegal and has no legal basis whatsoever.
　　IX. What is the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Korean War?
　　The statement issued by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko on July 4 has made the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Korean War very clear. The Soviet government has always adhered to the principle of strengthening world peace and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and believes that the Korean people have the right to unite South and North Korea into a single national state. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that the US government has taken hostile actions against peace and should be responsible for the consequences of its armed aggression, that the United Nations Security Council's decision is illegal, and that the United Nations can only fulfill its responsibility to maintain peace if it demands that the United States unconditionally stop interfering and immediately withdraw its troops from Korea. Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Stalin, in response to Indian Prime Minister Nehru's proposal on resolving the Korean issue, agreed to have the Korean issue resolved peacefully through a Security Council including representatives of the five major powers, including representatives of the People's Republic of China. And he said that in order to quickly resolve the Korean issue, it is appropriate to hear the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people in the Security Council.
　　X. What is the general development of the Korean War?
　　After crushing the full-line offensive of the puppet national defense army, the Korean People's Army of the Republic quickly turned to the counter-offensive. The three routes (west, center, east) of the Korean People's Army, overcoming various difficulties and defeating the resistance of the Syngman Rhee puppet army and the US interventionist army, rapidly advanced southward and have liberated more than half of the land in South Korea. About 60 important towns have been liberated, and seven of the eight divisions of the puppet army have been annihilated or defeated, and thousands of US troops have been killed, wounded, or captured. The Korean People's Army firmly grasps the initiative in military affairs, forcing the American aggressors and the puppet national defense army to flee from Seoul to Suwon, and from Suwon to Daejeon. Now they are fleeing from Daejeon to the more distant south in a panic. The American aggressors are still unwilling to fail, and they are continuing to reinforce their troops and indiscriminately bombing with the air force. Therefore, the Korean People's Army still faces a difficult struggle. However, this struggle of the American aggressors cannot save their fate of final defeat.
　　XI. The United States mobilized a large force to invade Korea, why is it constantly suffering defeats?
　　The reason why the United States is constantly suffering defeats in Korea is that the United States is conducting an aggressive and unjust war in Korea. It has no justification for its actions, so it is becoming increasingly isolated in the war. It has first been opposed by all the Korean people, and has also been opposed by the people of all countries in the world, including the awakened people of the United States. American soldiers do not know why they are fighting, so they lack fighting spirit, and many people have developed war-weariness. The American army mainly relies on the air force to fight, and the American army's combat experience and combat capabilities are very poor, while the resolution of the war mainly relies on the army. Although the United States has been preparing for this war of aggression against the Korean people for a long time, it made a big mistake. It overestimated its own strength and underestimated the strength of the Korean people. Therefore, after its plan for a "quick victory" suffered bankruptcy, it lost the initiative in military affairs and was beaten everywhere.
　　XII. Why can the Korean People's Army win battles?
　　The reason why the Korean People's Army can win battles is that it is the army of the Korean people. It is fighting to defend the independence of the motherland, strive for the unity of the country, and liberate the people of South Korea. Therefore, it has won the warm support of the 30 million people of Korea, and has also won the sympathy and support of the righteous people of the world. The Korean People's Army recognizes that the purpose and task of the Korean People's Liberation War are correct. This understanding enables the soldiers of the Korean People's Army to demonstrate unlimited dedication and heroism in fighting the enemy, and to demonstrate a high degree of ability to overcome difficulties and creativity. The Korean People's Army has the correct political and military leadership of the Workers' Party headed by General Kim Il-sung. All this makes the Korean People's Army have a very strong combat effectiveness and fighting will.
　　XIII. Can the Korean People's Liberation War achieve final victory?
　　The Korean People's Liberation War can achieve final victory. This is because the just people's liberation war waged by the Korean people is a national war against imperialist aggression. The Korean people are fighting on the territory of their motherland and have a solid rear and the support of the entire people. At the same time, the US aggression has aroused strong anger and opposition from the working people all over the world. The peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world stand on the side of the Korean people. On the other hand, US imperialism and its lackeys are conducting an unjust war of plunder, fighting on the territory of other countries across the ocean. US imperialism itself is a paper tiger that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Its defeat in Korea has not only discredited it internationally, but has also inevitably aroused anti-war sentiment at home. Although the United States now has the superficial and formal support of the governments of many satellite countries, there are many contradictions between them and the United States. For example, the vast majority of the governments of countries that supposedly support the United Nations' illegal resolutions have openly stated that they are unwilling to send troops to Korea to fight, which is a very good proof. It can be seen from this that the "unity" expressed by these satellite countries with the United States on the Korean issue is only superficial and formal. The fatal weakness of US imperialism is that it lacks manpower, with only 130 million people. Even if countries such as Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand join the United States in sending troops to fight, there will only be a little over 200 million people in total. What's more, the morale and spirit of the people in all the US and British countries are very low. Although there are many materials, the hearts of the people are not attached. Those war-mongers and Truman and others are very panicked in their hearts. The fact that they need to seize the illegal resolutions of the United Nations as a talisman in order to invade Korea, a country with a population of 30 million, is a manifestation of this panic. Therefore, the American aggressors are actually isolated, fragile, and will inevitably fail in the end.

### 关于朝鲜战争诸问题

　　关于朝鲜战争诸问题
    一、朝鲜是一个什么样的国家？简单地说，它的地理和历史情形怎样？
    朝鲜是战后一个新兴的人民民主国家，和我国的山东省隔海相望，北接我国的辽东、吉林两省，东北与苏联的远东区接壤。全国面积是二十二万零八百四十平方公里，约等于我国的湖南省，总人口约三千万，约等于我国的河北省。朝鲜这个国家已有四千多年悠久的历史。它在历史上曾经击败过外族四次的大规模进犯，即公元六一二年隋炀帝的百万人进犯，六四四年唐太宗三十万人的进犯，九九四年契丹八十万人的进犯和一五九二——一五九八年日本的二十万人进犯。一八九五年与一九○五年，积极向外扩张的日本帝国主义，战胜了腐败的满清政府与沙皇俄国政府，并在朝鲜卖国分子的勾引下，于一九一○年（即满清宣统二年）正式吞并了朝鲜，奴役朝鲜人民达三十六年之久。一九四五年八月，伟大的苏军从日本的奴役统治下解放了朝鲜，开辟了朝鲜人民成为自己国家主人的光明道路。但是美帝国主义利用战时临时划分的三八线，在北纬三十八度以南地区，扶植反动势力，分裂朝鲜，使南部朝鲜在战后实际上沦为美国的殖民地。
    二、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是怎样成立起来的，它的大概情形怎样？
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是在全朝鲜人民普选的基础上合法地产生的。一九四六年三月及一九四七年五月，美国代表两次破坏了苏美共同委员会会议以后，于一九四八年五月十日在南朝鲜导演了分裂的“选举”，制造了“大韩民国”和李承晚傀儡政府。
    为了反对美国的分裂政策，为了建立全朝鲜人民真正的最高政权机关，南、北朝鲜各政党、团体领袖于一九四八年六月二十九日召开了协商会议，决定于同年八月二十五日在全朝鲜举行真正的普选，产生朝鲜最高人民会议，建立统一的全国中央政府。在这次普选中，南朝鲜人民虽然在美、李军警的残酷镇压下，仍有百分之七十七点五二的选民投了票。北朝鲜百分之九十九点九七的选民，都热烈地投了票。这次真正全民的普选，产生了由五百七十二名代表组成的最高人民会议。一九四八年九月八日，最高人民会议首届会议通过了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法，宣布了共和国的诞生，并选出了以金日成将军为首的中央政府。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立后，即继承了北朝鲜人民委员会各种民主改革与经济建设的成果，在共和国北部地区更大力地展开了建设工作，并获得了显著的成果。一九四九年开始实行的两年经济计划的结果，已使共和国北半部去年的工业生产，增加到一九四六年的百分之三百七十七点一。在农业方面，去年虽是少有的旱年，但粮食生产仍比一九四四年增加了六十二万六千吨。在战争爆发以前，朝鲜人民正为提前完成两年经济计划的第二年度计划而努力。
    三、“三八”线是什么？
    “三八”线是指北纬三十八度线。一九四五年八月，英勇的苏军在击溃日本的关东军与朝鲜驻屯军后，首先进驻朝鲜。美军则在日本投降三个星期以后，才于九月八日在仁川港登陆。当时苏军与美军当局依照协议，以北纬线三十八度为界，分别占领朝鲜北半部和南半部，以便解除日军的武装。因此，“三八”线纯粹是战时的临时的措施，没有任何别的意义。但是，美国占领者违背开罗宣言及一九四五年莫斯科三外长会议关于给予朝鲜自由与独立的决定，却利用这种临时的划分，分裂朝鲜，阻挠全朝鲜人民一致要求的祖国统一。
    四、南朝鲜傀儡政府是个什么东西？
    南朝鲜李承晚的所谓“大韩民国政府”，是美帝国主义用刺刀支持起来的反民族、反人民的政权。这个“政府”是由美国占领者及所谓联合国朝鲜委员会于一九四八年五月十日，以单独的非法的“选举”方式制造出来的。在这次“选举”中，南朝鲜全部选民虽然在刺刀的威逼下，但前往投票的仍不到百分之三十。而今年五月三十日伪选的结果，李承晚的大韩国民党在其全部二百一十名的国会议席中只占二十二席，加上其控制的党羽，也不过四十五席。可见所谓“大韩民国政府”不仅完全不能代表朝鲜人民，而且也只是一小撮反动派中的一小撮。合众社六月二十五日东京电引所谓“有资格的观察家”所发表的谈话中，也不得不承认：“如果不是有美国的话，根本就不会有李承晚总统的大韩民国，南朝鲜实际上是美国所建立的。”在李承晚集团四年的统治下，南朝鲜变成了一个恐怖的地狱和屠场。李承晚集团四年中共屠杀了十五万爱国人民，逮捕了四十七万八千爱国者，解散了一百六十二个爱国政党与社会团体。李承晚集团同时把南朝鲜的一切政治、经济和军事主权，出卖给美国，使得南朝鲜的经济陷于破产，人民生活极端困苦。一九四九年，南朝鲜的企业总数，缩小到只有一九四三年的百分之三十六，耕地面积缩小到只有战前的百分之五十五，而物价则比战前高涨了八百二十一倍到一千零三倍。
    五、美帝国主义战后是怎样干涉朝鲜内政和准备内战的？
    美国军队一九四五年九月八日在仁川港登陆以后，首先解散了南朝鲜各地的人民政权——人民委员会，扶植朝鲜民族叛徒和亲日分子当政。同年十二月，莫斯科外长会议决定设立苏美联合委员会，协助朝鲜民主政党组织临时民主政府。但在一九四六年三月与一九四七年五月该委员会的两次会议上，美国代表破坏了委员会的会议，拒绝了苏联代表在第二次会议上提出的苏美同时撤军的建议。一九四七年九月，美国片面地将朝鲜问题提交联合国大会，利用它所操纵的多数，非法地设立了“联合国朝鲜委员会”，企图以联合国的招牌来掩盖它的侵略活动。一九四八年五月十日，美国实行了单独的分裂“选举”，制造了一个“大韩民国”。一九四八年九月十日，全朝鲜人民在普选中选出的最高人民会议首届会议，向美、苏两国提出建议，要求两国同时撤军，让朝鲜人民自己解决国家的统一问题。苏联政府立即同意了这一要求，并于一九四八年十二月将苏军撤退完毕。美国政府拒绝了这一要求，并迟至一九四九年六月底才宣布撤军，但仍留下一个五百人的军事顾问团和价值一亿一千万元的装备。
    美帝国主义为了准备朝鲜内战，给予李承晚集团以七亿三千万元的“经济援助”与“军事援助”，并利用它的庞大的军事顾问团，在南朝鲜训练与装备了十万伪军和五万警察，修建了仁川、釜山、木浦等海军基地和大田、大邱、金浦等空军基地。美帝国主义在认为它完成准备之后，便指使李承晚伪军发动了这次战争。
    六、这次朝鲜战争是谁挑动起来的？
    这次朝鲜战争是美帝国主义指使李承晚伪军挑动起来的。李承晚的伪国防军于六月二十五日拂晓，在“三八”线全线发动了突然的进攻，分兵三路，侵入北朝鲜一公里至二公里。
    李承晚伪军的突然进攻，是有长期准备的。从去年一月至今年四月，李承晚伪军曾在“三八”线发动了一千二百七十四次进攻。今年四、五月间，李承晚把它的伪国防军全部八个师中的五个师，结集在“三八”线沿线，并且狂叫“一九五○年内一定要北伐”。伪内务长官白性郁更明目张胆地道出了进犯的时机：“要在今年六、七月间解决三八线问题。”
    李承晚伪军的进攻，是美国侵略者直接指使的结果。美国经合总署“韩国分署”署长琼逊今年五月十九日在美国会作证时曾公开地说“以美国武器装备并由美国军事顾问团训练的南韩十万官兵，已经完成准备，可以随时作战。”而在美国防部长詹逊、参谋总长布莱德雷离开东京之后的第二天，国务院高级顾问杜勒斯“视察”三八线之后的第五天，李承晚集团即下了于二十五日实行全面进攻的“极密命令”。
    有人问：既然李承晚挑动了这次战争，为什么又打这样大的败仗呢？这是反动派经常对自已力量估计过高，对人民力量估计过低的原故。美国和李承晚只看见自己准备成熟，没有看见自己的外强中干，更没有料到北朝鲜的力量如此强大，以及在这一次实行反攻。这和蒋介石在四年以前进攻人民解放区但结果造成了自己的覆亡是一个道理，不过李承晚更加腐败无能罢了。人们都知道，美国是宣布为要打败北朝鲜而参战的，但结果也是自己的连续败退。可见反动派的企图是一件事，而实际结果却是另一件事。
    七、美帝国主义为什么要武装侵略朝鲜？
    美帝国主义所以要武装侵略朝鲜，是为了要夺取整个朝鲜，企图在全朝鲜建立反人民的傀儡政权，剥夺朝鲜民族的独立、自由和统一，以便把整个朝鲜变成美国的殖民地，变成美国在中苏两国东方边境的侵略跳板。
    八、为什么说联合国安全理事会对朝鲜的决议是非法的？
    因为安理会最近关于干涉朝鲜的一系列决议，都是粗暴地违背了联合国宪章。根据联合国宪章第二条，联合国“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”，禁止“联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。而朝鲜人民起来打倒发动内战的李承晚集团，实现祖国的独立与统一，显然是朝鲜人民的国内事务。同时，按照联合国宪章第二十七条，安理会对于非程序事项的“其他一切问题之决议，应以七理事国之可决票，包括全体常任理事国之同意票表决之”。但是，安理会六月二十七日通过的武装干涉朝鲜的决议，仅以六票（国民党代表的一票是非法的）通过，五个常任理事国中的两个常任理事国——苏联与中国，均未出席会议，并且反对这种决议。因此，安理会的决议完全是非法的，是没有任何法律根据的。
    九、苏联对朝鲜战争采取什么态度
    苏联副外长葛罗米柯七月四日发表的声明，已将苏联对朝鲜战争的态度，说得很清楚。苏联政府始终坚持加强世界和平与不干涉他国内政的原则，认为朝鲜人民有权把南、北朝鲜统一为一个单一的民族国家。苏联政府同时认为美国政府已采取了敌对和平的行动，应对其武装侵略的后果负责，联合国安全理事会的决定是非法的，联合国只有在要求美国无条件停止干涉与立即从朝鲜撤兵的情况下，才能履行它维护和平的职责。苏联部长会议主席斯大林在回答印度总理尼赫鲁关于解决朝鲜问题的建议时，同意经由包括中国人民政府代表在内的五大国代表参加的安理会，来使朝鲜问题得到和平解决。并且说，为了朝鲜问题的迅速解决，在安理会上听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见是适宜的。
    十、朝鲜战争的发展概况怎样？
    朝鲜共和国人民军在粉碎伪国防军的全线进攻后，迅速地转入了反攻。朝鲜人民军三路（西、中、东）大军在克服种种困难，并击破李承晚伪军与美国干涉军的抵抗下，迅速地向南进军，已经解放了南朝鲜一半以上的土地。解放重要城镇约六十座，歼灭或击溃伪军八个师中的七个师，毙伤俘美军数千名。朝鲜人民军在军事上紧握着主动权，打得美国侵略者及伪国防军由汉城逃到水原，由水原逃到大田。现在又在从大田向更远的南部慌乱地逃窜了。美国侵略者现在还不甘失败，它正在继续增援，同时用空军滥施轰炸，因此，在朝鲜人民军面前，还有一段艰苦的斗争。但是，美国侵略者的这种挣扎，决不能挽救其最后失败的命运。
    十一、美国动员了很大力量侵略朝鲜，为什么反而不断吃败仗？
    美国在朝鲜不断吃败仗，是因为美国在朝鲜进行的是侵略的、非正义的战争。它师出无名，因此它在战争中愈来愈孤立。它首先遭到了全朝鲜人民的反对，同时也遭到了世界各国人民，包括美国觉悟人民在内的反对。美国士兵不知为何作战，因而缺乏斗志，很多人发生了厌战的情绪。美国军队打仗主要靠空军，美国陆军的作战经验和作战能力都很差，而战争的解决主要却是靠陆军。美国这次对朝鲜人民的侵略战争，虽然准备已久，但是它犯了一个大错误，它过高地估计了自己的力量，过低地估计了朝鲜人民的力量。因此，在它“速胜”的计划遭受破产之后，它在军事上就丧失了主动权，处处挨打。
    十二、朝鲜人民军为什么能打胜仗？
    朝鲜人民军所以能打胜仗，是因为它是朝鲜人民的军队，它是为保卫祖国的独立，争取国家的统一与解放南朝鲜的人民而战。因此，它获得全朝鲜三千万人民的热烈拥护，也博得了全世界正义人民的同情和声援。朝鲜人民军认识到朝鲜人民解放战争的目的与任务是正确的，这种认识使朝鲜人民军战士们在对敌作战中，能表现出无限的献身精神与英雄气概，表现出高度的克服困难精神与创造性。朝鲜人民军有以金日成将军为首的劳动党的正确的政治领导和军事领导。这一切，就使得朝鲜人民军具有很强的战斗力和战斗意志。
    十三、朝鲜人民解放战争能不能取得最后胜利？
    朝鲜人民解放战争能够取得最后的胜利。这是因为朝鲜人民所进行的正义的人民解放战争，是反对帝国主义侵略的全民战争。朝鲜人民是在祖国的领土上作战，有巩固的后方与全体人民的支持。同时，美国的侵略引起了全世界劳动人民强烈的愤怒与反对。全世界爱好和平与自由的人民，都站在朝鲜人民方面。另一方面，美帝国主义及其仆从进行的是非正义的掠夺战争，是远涉重洋在他国的领土上作战。美帝国主义本身是外强中干的纸老虎，它在朝鲜的溃败不但使它在国际间的威信扫地，在国内也不能不引起反战思想的生长。美国现在虽然得到许多仆从国家政府的表面的和形式上的支持，但它们和美国之间有很多矛盾，例如目前绝大多数所谓拥护联合国非法决议的国家的政府都公开表示不愿派兵到朝鲜去打仗，便是很好的证明。由此可见，这些仆从国家表示与美国在朝鲜问题上的“一致”，只是表面的和形式上的一致。美帝国主义的致命弱点是人手不足，它只有一万万三千万人口。即使英国、加拿大、澳洲、南非、纽西兰等国一起加入美国一边出兵打仗，也总共只有两万万多一点人口。何况所有美英等国的人心和士气都是很低的，物质虽多，人心不附。那些战争贩子和杜鲁门等的心里是很恐慌的，为了要侵略一个三千万人口的朝鲜，需要抓往联合国的非法决议作护符，就是这种恐慌心理的表现。因此，美国侵略者实际上是孤立的，脆弱的，最后非失败不可。
