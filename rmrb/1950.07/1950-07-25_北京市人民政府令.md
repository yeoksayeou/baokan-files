　　Beijing Municipality 1950 Emergency Measures for Cholera Prevention

　　1. The main scope of the emergency measures for cholera prevention that should be implemented in this city is as follows:

　　1. Expand epidemic prevention propaganda: Focus on the current situation, raise public awareness, with the introduction of simple prevention methods, reporting on the epidemic situation in various places, advising on accepting preventive injections, and paying attention to food, drink, and environmental hygiene as the main content. The Municipal Health Committee will use various methods to carry out expanded propaganda, and the specific methods will be formulated separately.

　　2. Epidemic reporting: When suspected cholera patients are discovered in the city, citizens should immediately report to the local health center for investigation and treatment (and may also go directly to the infectious disease hospital for diagnosis and treatment). In areas without health centers, reports should be made to the district office (government) and forwarded to the epidemic prevention team of the Public Health Bureau. If medical workers are involved, they should report to the health center in their district immediately after preliminary diagnosis for investigation and treatment, and forward the report to the epidemic prevention team of the Public Health Bureau for registration.

　　3. Quarantine: Before the implementation of quarantine work in this city, the quarantine and disinfection work inside the train cars for passengers arriving in Beijing by train before entering the station will be handled by the Health Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. If suspected cholera patients are found, contact the Municipal Public Health Bureau for handling.

　　4. Preventive injections: A. Focus on injecting simple cholera vaccine. The health committees of each district are responsible for designating dates and locations in stages, and announcing to the public to go for injections on schedule. Those who have not received injections after the deadline will be given compulsory injections. B. Injections should be carried out on the principle of being broad and organized, starting with the implementation focusing on the third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts where there are more poor residents. When there are insufficient staff in the district, the Municipal Health Committee will send personnel to assist in the completion. C. The vaccination record, which serves as a supplementary page to the household registration, has already established a good foundation in the suburbs. It is decided to widely adopt it in urban and suburban districts during this period. The Public Health Bureau will rush to print it for use, and the Public Security Bureau will assist in its promotion.

　　5. Strengthen the inspection and disinfection of drinking water: A. The amount of chlorine added to tap water should be increased in the near future, and it should be ensured that the southern part of the city maintains a residual chlorine content of 0.1 parts per million. All water source wells in the city will be temporarily suspended from supplying water, and the water plant in the western suburbs will quickly install disinfection equipment. B. Public drinking water wells must be universally disinfected, and the number of disinfection times should be increased to two to three times a day. Private wells are restricted from public drinking (except for those with special reasons and approved by the Public Health Bureau), and inspection and disinfection will be implemented. Those used exclusively for industrial purposes and with poor water quality will be prohibited from drinking.

　　6. Strengthen food and drink management: A. Cold drinks and food: 1. All shops and stalls selling cold drinks and food must have appropriate and reasonable sanitary equipment, and inspections should be strengthened. 2. Stores selling popsicles must have appropriate utensils for hawkers to use, and they will be allowed to sell in batches only after being inspected and approved by the Public Health Bureau (if the hawker's own utensils meet the requirements, they can also apply to the Public Health Bureau for inspection and approval). 3. Iced cold food should all use artificial ice, except for those with refrigeration equipment. 4. Shaved ice, preserved fruit, dried apricot soup, sour jujube soup, dried fruit soup, sweet water (made of sugar or saccharin plus seasonings and pigments) will be temporarily advised to stop selling voluntarily during the epidemic prevention period, in addition to inspection and management. B. General food and drink: 1. All foods that enter the mouth directly must have strict fly-proof equipment. Those that need to be iced but do not have appropriate equipment should all use artificial ice. 2. Rotten food and drink are strictly prohibited from sale. 3. Watermelons must not be cut open for sale unless they have a closed glass or gauze cover with doors. The implementation of the above A and B items should be included in the sanitary convention through the respective industry organizations, and the responsible bureaus (Public Health Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Commercial Bureau) will supervise the implementation.

　　7. Garbage and manure disposal: During the emergency measures period for epidemic prevention, the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau will actively strengthen management in coordination with the comprehensive prevention work for the disposal of garbage and manure in the city.

　　2. The start and end of the emergency measures period mentioned in these measures will be announced to the public in writing by the Municipal Health Committee.

　　3. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.
