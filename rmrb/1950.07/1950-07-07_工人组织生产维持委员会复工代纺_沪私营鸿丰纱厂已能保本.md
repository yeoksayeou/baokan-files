　　Workers Organize Production Maintenance Committee to Resume Spinning
    Shanghai Private Hong Feng Yarn Factory Now Able to Break Even
    [Our Newspaper] Shanghai private Hong Feng Yarn Factory employees, under the leadership of the factory's trade union and the Shanghai Textile Workers' Union work team, struggled with the capitalists to maintain production, preserving the factory. After the capitalists abandoned the factory and fled, they further organized armed pickets to suppress sabotage by bad elements, and elected a production committee to lead production. With the support of the state-owned economy, all 15,000 spindles in the factory have restarted, solving the unemployment problem for over a thousand workers, and it has now reached the point of breaking even on contract spinning.
    This factory was solely operated by Rong Hongyuan, a well-known speculative capitalist in Shanghai. It was established at the end of 1945, with 24,000 spindles and over a thousand workers. Due to infighting among senior staff and the enticement and sabotage of special agents, the situation in the factory was extremely chaotic, labor discipline was extremely lax, and production efficiency was very low. In the months before liberation, Rong Hongyuan emptied the funds and transported some of the spindles to Hong Kong. Rong Xiaofan was entrusted as acting manager, but the remaining debts exceeded the total capital.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the trade union, the workers originally wanted to win over the capitalists by increasing production. Through the workers' efforts, the output of 20-count yarn increased from a minimum of 0.47 pounds per spindle (20 hours) before liberation to 0.68 pounds. However, the capitalists were still unwilling to produce, and finally, after the New Year, they suddenly shut down completely. The acting manager, Rong Xiaofan, also secretly fled at the end of February, leaving over a thousand workers in dire straits. In this chaotic situation, bad elements lurking in the factory took the opportunity to spread rumors, attack the prestige of the People's Government, and at the same time, steal and sabotage the factory on a large scale. The Shanghai Textile Workers' Union, recognizing the complexity and seriousness of the factory's situation, immediately sent a work team to the factory to assist in the work. The team, based on the principles of "stopping sabotage, establishing order, contract spinning to break even, and maintaining production," first conducted extensive publicity and education among the workers using the vivid facts of the capture of five thieves, including Liu Guofu, and displayed photos and cartoons of the thieves in each workshop. At the same time, meetings of activists and middle-of-the-roaders were held, proposing the slogans "Oppose theft, stop chaos, and stabilize order." As the workers' awareness increased, the bad elements dared not be rampant. On the basis of the workers' self-awareness, a picket team was established to protect the factory, and the policy of maintaining production through contract spinning was decided.
    Under the suggestion of the work team, production representatives were democratically elected in each workshop, and the Production Maintenance Committee was officially established on March 13. It was clearly stipulated that before the capitalists returned to the factory, the committee would be temporarily responsible for managing production within the factory, freezing all the capitalists' materials in the factory for the purpose of maintaining production; the factory's original debts would be borne by the capitalists; and all employees of the factory would have the right to claim back wages owed. The committee negotiated with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and signed a contract spinning agreement. The factory also formulated a break-even production plan for contract spinning; a production mobilization meeting was held, and after democratic discussion, production quotas were allocated to each workshop. For more than 100 workers who voluntarily returned to their hometowns to engage in production, each was given 75 discounted units for travel expenses, and they retained the right to be preferentially employed by the factory.
    On March 18, the factory officially started contract spinning for the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and the entire factory was refreshed. Workers who had been ideologically backward and deceived in the past were deeply moved. They sincerely said to the comrades of the work team: "You have really come to rescue us!" The workers of the picket team volunteered to transport 933 dan of cotton entrusted for contract spinning from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company back to the factory. The workers voluntarily took the minimum wage, and the A and B shift workers rotated once every four days. The average minimum monthly wage for each person was less than 36 discounted units, and even the highest-skilled only received 91 units. However, production volume increased day by day. Taking the cone winding room as an example, the production quota for the workshop was 180 pounds per day. The highest output on the first day reached 208 pounds, the ninth day increased to 236 pounds, and the tenth day reached 257 pounds, setting an unprecedented record for the factory. By March 21, the factory's total output had reached the break-even standard of 15 pieces of yarn per day; the labor required per piece of yarn had been reduced from 42.73 work-hours to 33 work-hours, and it is estimated that it will be further reduced to 25 work-hours soon. There have also been great achievements in terms of savings. The waste produced per piece of yarn has been reduced by an average of 27 percent compared to the past, the rate of returning waste has also been reduced from 94 percent to 90 percent, and the power consumption has been reduced from 330 degrees to 265 degrees.
    Currently, the factory's trade union is using the shift break time to first strengthen the education of workers' activists and production team leaders, further enhancing the workers' awareness and giving play to the workers' enthusiasm as masters of their own affairs, in order to consolidate the continued high production morale and further improve the factory's operation and management and various systems.

　　工人组织生产维持委员会复工代纺
    沪私营鸿丰纱厂已能保本
    【本报讯】上海私营鸿丰纱厂职工，在该厂工会及上海纺织工会工作组领导之下，与资方作维持生产的斗争，把工厂保全下来；并于资本家弃厂逃跑后，进一步组织武装纠察队，镇压了坏分子的破坏，选出了生产委员会来领导生产。在国营经济的扶助下，全厂一万五千枚纱锭重新转动起来，解决了千余工人的失业问题，现已达到保本代纺。
    该厂是上海有名的投机资本家荣鸿元独资经营的，开办于一九四五年底，有纱锭二万四千枚，工人千余名。厂内由于高级职员间的互相倾轧，特务分子的拉拢破坏，情况非常混乱，劳动纪律极为松弛，生产效率很低。解放前数月，荣鸿元就把资金抽空，并搬运一部分纱锭到香港。委托荣孝范为代经理，但所留债务已超过全部资金。
    解放后，工人在工会的领导下，原想以提高生产来争取资方。经过工人的努力，二十支纱的产量已由解放前每锭最低○·四七磅增为○·六八磅（二十小时）。但资方仍然不愿生产，终于新年后突然全部停工，代经理荣孝范亦于二月底偷跑，致千余工人生活陷于绝境。在此混乱情况下，潜伏在厂内的坏分子乘机散布谣言，打击人民政府威信，同时并大肆偷窃，破坏工厂。上海纺织工会鉴于该厂情况复杂，问题严重，当即派工作组赴厂协助工作。该组本“制止破坏，建立秩序，保本代纺，维持生产”的方针，首先以刘国富等五人偷窃被破获的生动事实在工人中广泛进行宣传教育，并在各车间展览窃贼照片及漫画。同时召开了积极分子和中间分子会议，提出“反对偷窃、制止混乱和稳定秩序”的口号。随着工人觉悟的提高，坏分子亦不敢猖狂了。在工人自觉的基础上，建立起纠察队保护工厂，并决定了通过代纺维持生产的方针。
    在工作组的建议之下，各车间民主选举了生产代表，于三月十三日正式建立生产维持委员会。明确规定：在资方未回厂前，暂由该委员会负责管理厂内生产，冻结资方厂内一切物资，作为维持生产之用；工厂原有债务由资方负责；全厂职工所欠薪金有追偿权。该会经与花纱布公司协商，订立了代纺合同。厂内并制订了代纺保本生产计划；召开生产动员会议，经过民主讨论，分配了各车间的生产定额。对一百多个自愿还乡生产的工人，每人发给七十五个折实单位的路费，并保留他们被该厂优先雇佣的权利。
    三月十八日，该厂正式开工为花纱布公司代纺，全厂气象焕然一新。过去思想落后受了欺骗的工人大受感动，他们诚恳地向工作组同志说：“你们真是来搭救我们的！”纠察队的工友自报奋勇，从花纱布公司把委托代纺的九百三十三担棉花运回。工人们自愿拿最低限度的工资，并且甲乙两班工人四天轮班一次，每人每月平均最低工资不足三十六个折实单位，技术最高的也只有九十一个单位。但生产量却逐日上升。以筒子间为例，该车间生产定额为日产一百八十磅，第一天最高产量即达二百零八磅，第九天增至二百三十六磅，第十天已达二百五十七磅，创该厂空前纪录。至三月二十一日，该厂总产量已达日产十五件纱的保本标准；每件纱所需人工，已由四十二·七三工减为三十三工，估计最近还将减为二十五工。在节约方面也有很大的成绩，每件纱所出的腿花比过去平均减低百分之二十七，回花率亦由百分之九十四减为百分之九十，用电量则由三三○度减为二六五度。
    现该厂工会已利用轮班休息时间，首先加强工人积极分子和生产小组长的教育，进一步提高工人的觉悟，发挥工人当家作主的积极性，以便巩固继续高涨的生产情绪，进一步改进该厂的经营管理和各种制度。
