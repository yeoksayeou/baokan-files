The Beijing Public Bus Company has now opened twelve routes (including the newly opened Jingfeng Line). Because the opening times of each route are inconsistent, and the fares were set according to the prices at that time, the fares for each route are uneven. For example, Routes 2 and 3 calculate fares by the stop: 100 yuan for the starting stop, and an additional 100 yuan for each additional stop, with as many as ten types of fares. Routes 4, 6, and 7 calculate fares by section (every two stops is a section): 200 yuan for the starting section, and an additional 100 yuan for each additional section. The suburban routes have inconsistent section lengths and the fares are not determined according to the length of kilometers.

Therefore, the Public Bus Company has decided to reasonably adjust the fares from July 1st. The urban routes will all use 200 yuan as the starting section, with an additional 100 yuan for each additional section (two stops as a section). This means that for Routes 2 and 3, passengers traveling only one stop will pay an additional 100 yuan, passengers traveling two or three stops will have no change in fare, and passengers traveling more than three stops will have a reduction of approximately 10 to 30 percent. Since very few passengers travel only one stop, and passengers traveling more than three stops account for more than 90 percent, this will reduce the burden for the majority of passengers. The unreasonable parts of the suburban routes will also be adjusted.

　　公共汽车公司调整票价
    京市公共汽车公司现已开辟到十二条行车路线（包括新开之京丰线），由于各个开辟的时间不一致。而票价是根据当时物价所订，故各路高低不等。如二路及三路，以站计算，起站一百元，以后多乘一站增加一百元，票类有十种之多；四路、六路、七路以段计算（每二站为一段），起段为二百元，以后多乘一段增加一百元；郊区路线又因分段长短不一致，不是按公里长短订定票价。为此，公共汽车公司决定自七月一日起将票价加以合理调整，市区路线全按二百元为起段，多乘一段（二站为一段）增加一百元，这样二、三路票价只乘一站者增加一百元，乘二、三站者票价不变，乘三站以上者减少百分之十至三十左右。按一站的乘客很少，三站以上的乘客，占百分之九十以上，故对大多数乘客是减轻了负担。郊区路线也将不合理部分加以调整。
