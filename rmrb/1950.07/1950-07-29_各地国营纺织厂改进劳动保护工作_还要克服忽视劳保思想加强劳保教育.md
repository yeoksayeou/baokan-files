State-owned Textile Factories in Various Regions Improve Labor Protection Work
	Must Also Overcome Neglect of Labor Protection Ideology and Strengthen Labor Protection Education
[Our Newspaper’s News] Since the hygiene and safety inspection team inspected the labor protection facilities of Tianjin China Textile factories in March of this year, the labor protection work of state-owned textile factories in various regions has greatly improved. Especially in terms of sanitation, factories in most regions have paid attention to and improved the cleanliness and equipment of canteens, dormitories, toilets, and bathhouses. The vast majority of textile workers in Tianjin and Qingdao no longer eat cold food. Workshops in Northeast China, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places have special drinking water equipment. Most factories in various regions have issued masks to workers on schedule, and set up spittoons and washbasins in the workshops. The ventilation and lighting in some factory workshops have also been improved. In order to take care of workers' full sleep, the Qingdao Municipal Textile Union organizes family members to look after children so that workers on night shifts can sleep peacefully. State-owned textile factories in larger cities have started from the aspect of active prevention, quite universally organizing workers to have physical examinations and establishing clinics. The Northeast Fourth Textile Factory has also established a sanatorium for lung diseases. According to statistics, the mortality rate of Tianjin China Textile factories in the first half of 1950 decreased by half compared with 1949.
	Although the labor protection work of state-owned textile factories in various regions has made certain improvements, there are still many shortcomings. For example, some factories simply increase labor intensity for the sake of "tasks" and "achievements," regardless of the health of workers. In June, Tianjin China Textile Factory continuously worked overtime, greatly increasing the number of sick workers. There were also factories where worker injuries and deaths occurred. On May 15, Qingdao Huaxin Yarn Factory caused a worker to be strangled to death by a dyeing machine because it called unskilled workers to watch the machine. The temperature in the workshops of Qingdao China Textile Factories 3, 5, 8, and 9 is above 104 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, which has a great impact on workers' health.
	Some administrative departments of state-owned factories believe that "ventilation equipment requires American materials" or that "it will cost a lot of money to start," and therefore adopt an irresponsible and delayed attitude towards improving labor protection facilities, so that some shortcomings that could be improved have not been improved in time. The practice of Tianjin China Textile Factory 4 using foreign wells to regulate the temperature of the workshop is a powerful criticism of the above-mentioned wrong ideas.
	In general, textile factories do not pay enough attention to labor protection education, so that the improved labor protection facilities cannot play their due role. Although state-owned textile factories in Northeast China, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places have installed spittoons in the workshops, most workers still spit phlegm outside of them. Some factories issued masks, but the workers do not wear them. In Tianjin China Textile Factory 1, due to lack of attention to hygiene education this month, workers casually ate snacks, and many workers suffered from gastrointestinal diseases. More than 300 people took sick leave. The trade union organizations of the above-mentioned factories must pay serious attention to these situations and overcome them.

### 各地国营纺织厂改进劳动保护工作  还要克服忽视劳保思想加强劳保教育

　　各地国营纺织厂改进劳动保护工作
    还要克服忽视劳保思想加强劳保教育
    【本报讯】自从今年三月卫生安全检查组检查了天津中纺各厂的劳动保护设施以来，各地国营纺织厂的劳动保护工作，已有很大改进。尤其是卫生工作方面，多数地区的工厂都注意并改进了食堂、宿舍、厕所、澡堂的清洁和设备。天津和青岛的绝大多数纺织工人，已不再吃冷饭了。东北、天津、青岛等地的车间有了饮水的专门设备。各地多数工厂已按期发给工人口罩，在车间设置了痰盂和洗手盆。有的工厂车间的通风和照明也都有了改善。为了照顾工人的充分睡眠，青岛市纺织工会组织家属看小孩，让作夜班的工人能安心睡觉。较大城市的国营纺织厂更从积极预防方面着手，相当普遍地组织工人去检查体格，并建立了医疗所。东北第四纺织厂还建立了肺病疗养院。据统计，天津中纺各厂一九五○年上半年比一九四九年的死亡率减少一半。
    目前各地国营纺织厂的劳动保护工作虽已有了一定的改进，但仍存在很多缺点。如有的厂为了“任务”和“成绩”单纯提高劳动强度，而不顾工人健康。天津中纺厂六月份不断地加班加点，大大增加了病号。还有的厂发生了伤亡工人的事情。青岛华新纱厂于五月十五日因调用不熟练的工人看车，致使工人被染布机绞死。青岛中纺三、五、八、九各厂车间温度在华氏一○四到一一○度以上，对工人身体健康影响很大。
    还有的国营厂的行政方面认为：“通风设备要装美国材料”，或者是“一动手就要花很多钱”，因而对改善劳保设施采取了不负责任的拖延态度，使得一些可能改进的缺点还未及时改进。天津中纺四厂用洋井调剂了车间温度的作法，正是对上述错误思想的有力的批判。
    一般纺织厂对劳保教育也不够重视，使已有改进的劳保设施不能发挥应有的作用，东北、天津、青岛等地的国营纺织厂，虽然在车间安置了痰盂，但一般工友还是有痰不往痰盂里吐。有的厂发了口罩，工人不戴。天津中纺一厂本月内因不注意卫生教育，工友们随便吃零食，很多工人害肠胃病，请病假的竟有三百多人。上述情况，各厂的工会组织必须引起严重注意，予以克服。
