Teacher Maksimova's Method of Teaching Russian
    Su Xing
    The experimental class of the Russian Language Specialized Training Program led by Soviet teacher Maksimova is a class that applies Soviet pedagogy and Russian teaching principles from the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section of Renmin University for experimental teaching. Classes began on January 4th of this year. Originally, there were ten students who had never studied Russian, with the equivalent of one or two years of university education and a knowledge of one foreign language. Seven more students transferred in midway. After only six months of study, they have achieved the following results: mastered nearly two thousand five hundred Russian root words; learned basic grammar; at a Russian speech contest, students gave speeches in Russian on topics such as "The Victory of the Soviet Patriotic War," "Biography of Chairman Mao," and "Labor Hero Li Fenglian"; some students wrote essays in Russian on "The Promulgation of Reactionary Decrees by American Occupiers" and "Biography of Mayakovsky."
    These achievements are quite remarkable. Their rapid progress is due, on the one hand, to the students' high enthusiasm for learning in conjunction with political and ideological education; self-study is led and organized; and the students have a relatively good cultural foundation and have studied other foreign languages. But the main reason lies in Teacher Maksimova's excellent work ethic and the scientific teaching methods she has created that are suitable for Chinese students.

            Oral Teaching in the Preparation Period
    The teaching program of the experimental group does not begin with teaching the alphabet and pronunciation, but rather first allows students to memorize a certain number of vocabulary words, engage in the simplest daily conversations, and then learn the pronunciation of these words, followed by learning to read and write. Professor Maksimova calls this oral teaching the "preparation period" teaching. This is what she has created based on the experience of Russian language teaching in the Soviet national republics and Russian language teaching for Chinese students. She believes that if non-Russian students learn Russian starting with "reading," students often read and speak according to the way they pronounce their own native language, and pronounce each letter stiffly, and cannot accurately pronounce the stress. Starting with "writing" requires breaking down each word, which first requires understanding it. Therefore, she decided to start with oral language and use it as preparation for reading and writing, so that students can develop the habit of listening; understand words; pronounce correctly and accumulate a certain number of new words.
    The first step in teaching: use posters, real objects, and actions to allow students to directly understand words. The teacher corrects the pronunciation from the side and allows the students to imitate the teacher to ask and answer questions. For example, in the first lesson, students are asked to understand words such as: teacher, student, university student, female university student, female teacher, female student, I, he, you; and learn several verbs such as read, sit, stand, write, and some simple conjunctions, affirmative or negative adverbs. After the students understand, they can start having Russian conversations in the first lesson. For example, "Who is this? -- This is a teacher." "Am I a university student? -- Yes, you are a university student." "The teacher is standing and the students are sitting." This makes it very interesting for students to memorize these new words.
    Then, each lesson replaces new words and sentences, and the content and structure gradually become more complex. But one principle must be grasped: the selection of words should be closely related to the teaching and living environment. Maksimova said: "During the preparation period, the teacher should carefully consider every word given to the students, and should not teach irrelevant words."
    During this period, there is also some grammar learning, but the amount is small, because grammar rules are mastered through application.

            Learning Phonetics and Writing Exercises
    The second step in Russian teaching: analyze phonetics, learn letters, and write. Initially, words that students are accustomed to hearing are used to analyze phonetics. Her procedure for teaching words and phonetics is not according to the alphabet, but according to the system of Chinese linguistics: first learn the phonetics and words that are homophones with the native language, and then learn the phonetics and syllables that are different from the native language. Correct pronunciation is required from the beginning, so it is not required to be too fast. Dictation proceeds slowly from reading and writing. At this time, posters and conversations are also used. In practicing pronunciation, reading, and writing, more detailed and slower teaching is given to consonant letters with "voiced sounds" and "voiceless sounds."
    After students learn phonetics and letters, they can learn to use dictionaries and slowly learn more complex sentences: such as "Moscow is the capital of the Soviet Union" and "My motherland is China." In the experimental group, this stage of teaching took a total of ten days. Students mastered some simple vocabulary, learned all the letters and phonetics, and learned the "gender" and "number" of nouns, the use of the third position of verbs, and some simple sentences and conversations.

            Combining Reading, Writing, and Grammar Learning
    On January 23rd, the study of short articles began. First, posters were used, and later mainly copying on the blackboard. At this time, there were no textbooks yet. For words that students did not know, she would note the page number of the dictionary after the word. After each short article was studied, the summary of the content was used for grammatical material and explained. In this way, the reading, writing, and grammar of Russian are gradually unified.
    The content of the short articles is based on the students' level, from shallow to deep, and all are taken from topics closely related to real-life struggles, such as railway heroes, International Women's Day, the October Revolution, the biography of Mao Zedong, International Youth Day, and the Chinese army and people. The students all feel that such short articles are very realistic, kind, and interesting. So far, the students have learned thirty-one short articles of varying lengths.
    The teaching of grammar is coordinated with the lessons, and the following have been learned: the gender, number, and case of nouns; verb conjugation; present tense, past tense, and imperative mood; adjective changes; numerals, adverbs, and some prepositions. Sentence structure analysis is now underway. The students said: "Other teachers teach grammar cases, and it is always troublesome and difficult to remember, but when Maksimova teaches it, it feels very easy because she arranges the time well and gives many examples."
    Throughout the entire teaching process, she always pays attention to the students' conversation. A portion of the time is always set aside for conversation during class. The content of the conversation is closely related to real life. For example, on Mondays, each student is asked what they did on Sunday, and a series of questions are asked. She carefully corrects and supplements. After the "May 1st" and "May 4th" parades, the situation of the day is used as a topic for various exercises. The students accept these contents quickly and with great interest.
    In the experimental group, a monthly test is scheduled at the end of each month. The exam is not only to test the students' grades, but also to encourage students to review the courses that have been taught, and is a summary of teaching. Before the exam, she enthusiastically helps students review. Various methods are used during the exam, such as dictation, questions and answers, sentence making, case changes, conjugation, conversation, and composition. The exam results of the experimental group have always been very good, with more than 90% of the students getting five points and four points in each exam. (Note: The class adopts a "five-point system," with five points being the highest score).

            The Teacher's Sense of Responsibility Encourages Students' Learning Enthusiasm
    The teaching experience created by Maksimova has now been widely adopted at Renmin University of China. As she herself said in her summary report: "It has great significance for Russian language teaching at Renmin University."
    Maksimova has a high degree of conscientiousness and responsibility. She cares about the progress of every student; she always prepares very well before class; she carefully and promptly corrects students' homework. Her work attitude has become a force to encourage students to move forward. Every student feels ashamed in front of the teacher when they have not prepared their homework well. The students said: "She has never lost her temper, and we are always filled with gratitude towards her."
    On "June 6th" Teachers' Day, the students gave her a commemorative album and flowers. Slogans were written on the blackboard in the classroom. When the students presented flowers, she was so moved that she was about to cry, and she embraced the female student who presented the flowers and kissed her warmly. She said that she would send the photo taken with the students back to Leningrad, and at the same time, looking at the slogans on the blackboard, she said: "It's a pity that there is no such a big envelope, otherwise I would have sent it back to Leningrad too."

　　教师玛克西莫娃教授俄文的方法
    苏星
    苏联教师玛克西莫娃所领导的俄文专修班实验组是人民大学俄文教研室应用苏联教育学的俄语讲授原理，进行实验教学的班次。从今年一月四日开始上课。原来有十名学生，他们都没学过俄文，有大学一二年的文化水平，会一种外国语。中途又转来了七个同学。他们仅仅经过六个月的学习，已经有了如下的成绩：掌握了将近两千五百个俄文原形字；学会了基本的文法知识；在一次俄文讲演会上，同学们用俄语讲了“苏联卫国战争的胜利”、“毛主席的传记”和“劳动英雄李凤连”等讲题；有些同学用俄文写了散文“美国占领者颁布反动法令”和“马雅可夫斯基的传记”。
    这些成绩是相当可观的。他们进步之所以快，一方面，是由于同学们配合政治思想教育，有很高的学习热情；自学有领导有组织；同学的文化基础较好，学过别的外国语。但主要的还是在于教师玛克西莫娃优异的工作精神和她在教学中所创造的科学的适合于中国学生的教学方法。
            准备期的口头教学
    实验组的教学程序，不是从教字母发音开始，而是先让学生记住一定数量的语汇，作最简单的日常会话，然后才学这些单字的发音，再学读和写。玛克西莫娃教授把这种口头教授叫做“准备期”的教学。这是她根据苏联各民族共和国俄语教学和对中国学生俄语教学的经验所创造出来的。她认为：非俄语学生学习俄语如果从“读”开始，学生常会照自己的本国语言的方式读和说，并且会生硬地照单个字母发音，而且读不准重音。从“写”开始，则需要分解每个单字，这首先就需要理解它。因此她决定从口语开始，并把它作为读和写的准备工作，使学生能养成听的习惯；理解单字；正确地发音和积累一定数量的生字。
    教学的第一个步骤：用挂图、实物和动作来让学生直接领悟单字。先生从旁指正发音和让学生模仿教师来作问答。例如在第一课要学生理解这样一些单字：教员、学生、大学生、女大学生、女教员、女学生、我、他、您；并且学了读、坐、站、写等几个动词和一些简单的连结词，肯定或否定的副词，学生听懂之后，在第一课开始，就可以进行俄语会话了。比如“这是谁？——这是教员。”“我是大学生吗？——是，您是大学生。”“教员站着而学生坐着。”使学生很有兴趣地就记熟了这些生字。
    接着，每一课都更换新的单字和句子，内容和构造也逐渐复杂。但是要掌握一个原则，选择字词要和教学生活环境紧紧地相联系。玛克西莫娃说：“在准备期间，教师给学生的每一个单字都应该慎重考虑，不应该教给不相干的单字。”
    这个期间，也有文法的学习，但分量很少，因为文法规则是靠应用而精通的。
            字音的学习和书写练习
    俄语教学的第二个步骤：分析拼音，学习字母和书写。开始先用学生听惯的单字分析字音。她教单字和字音时的程序也不是按字母表，而是按照中国语言学的系统来制定的：先学习与本国语同音的字音和单字，再学习与本国语不相同的字音和音节。发音在开始就要求正确，因此不要求太快。从读和写慢慢进行听写。这时也利用挂图和会话。在练习发音、阅读和书写中，对“有音字”和“无音字”的子音字母都作了较详尽和较缓慢的教导。
    学生经过字音和字母的学习，就可以学习使用字典，慢慢学习比较复杂的句子：如“莫斯科是苏联的国都”、“我的祖国是中国”等。在实验组，这一阶段的教学一共用了十几天的时间。学生掌握了一些简单的语汇，学完了全部字母和拼音，并且学了名词的“性”和“数”，动词第三位的用法，以及一些简单的句子和会话。
            阅读、书写和文法学习相结合
    一月二十三日开始学习短文。先使用挂图，后来主要是在黑板上抄写，这时还没有教科书。同学不知道的单字，她就在字后面注上字典的页数。每学习过一篇短文之后，都把内容的摘要利用到文法资料上，加以讲解。这样就逐步地使俄文的阅读、书写和文法统一起来。
    短文的内容是根据学生的程度，由浅而深，都是取自与现实斗争生活密切关连的题材，如铁路英雄，国际妇女节，十月革命，毛泽东传，国际青年节，中国的军队和人民等。同学们都感到这样的短文很现实，很亲切有趣。到现在为止，同学们已经学了大小三十一篇短文。
    文法的讲授是和课文配合进行的，已学过的有名词的性、数、格；动词的变位；现在式，过去式及命令方式；形容词的变化；数词，副词和一部分前置词。现在正进行句子构造的分析。同学们说：“别的教员教文法变格，都觉得麻烦不好记，但玛克西莫娃教的时候却感到很轻松，因为她时间安排的好，举的例子多。”
    在整个教学过程中，她始终注意学生的会话。上课时总要抽出一部分时间来进行会话。会话内容是和实际生活紧密联系的。例如在星期一，就问每个学生在星期日作了什么，连续地问几个问题。她细心的纠正和补充。“五一”和“五四”大游行之后，就拿当天的情形作题材来进行各种练习。学生们充满兴趣地很快的就接受了这些内容。
    在实验组，每月月终规定有一次月考，考试不仅是为了测验学生的成绩，而且会推动学生复习已讲过的课程，是教学的总结。考试之前，她热心地帮助学生复习。考试时采取各种不同的方式，如听写、问答、造句、变格、变位、会话和作文。实验组的考试成绩一贯是很好的，每次考试百分之九十以上的同学都得到五分和四分。（按：该班采用“五分制”，五分是最高分数）。
            教师的负责精神鼓舞了学生的学习情绪
    玛克西莫娃所创造的教学经验，现在已经在中国人民大学普遍地采用了。正如她自己在总结报告中说到的：“它对人民大学的俄文教学有着很大的意义。”
    玛克西莫娃有高度的认真负责的精神。她关心到每一个学生的进步；上课前总是准备的很充分；她细心而及时地批改学生的作业。她的工作态度已成为鼓舞学生前进的力量。每个同学当自己有一次没准备好自己的功课时，在教师面前都感到内心的惭愧。同学说：“她从没发过脾气，我们对她总是充满感激的心情。”
    “六六”教师节，同学们给她送纪念册，献花。在教室的黑板上写了标语。同学献花时她感动的要流泪，拥抱着献花的女同学热吻。她说她将把和同学合照的像片寄回列宁格勒去，同时看着黑板上的标语说：“可惜没有这样大的信封，否则也要寄回列宁格勒去的。”
