Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 19th: Marinin, in an international commentary in *Pravda*, exposed the attempt by the American ruling clique to transform Korea into an American bridgehead and to enslave the entire Korean nation.

Marinin wrote: When the American government launched its aggression against Korea, it clearly underestimated the great strength of the Korean people. The answer they received was the unprecedented unity of all patriotic forces in Korea. The Korean people have stood up to wage a just and patriotic war to save their country.

Marinin pointed out: The Security Council, which should bear the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security in accordance with the UN Charter, is now actually playing the role of an auxiliary organ of the US General Staff. The US ruling clique's retention of the self-appointed Nationalist representative on the Security Council is what makes it impossible for representatives of two major powers—the Soviet Union and China—to participate in the work of the Security Council, turning this most important body of the UN into a department that registers and executes American orders.

Marinin emphasized: The American newspapers are constantly clamoring for "reorganizing the United Nations" according to the plan of Hoover, the chieftain of American fascist reactionaries. In the final analysis, this is to completely "Americanize" the United Nations, that is, to formally integrate the United Nations with the Atlantic bloc.

Marinin concluded: Even if the title of commander of a so-called "United Nations army" is given to MacArthur, who leads the interventionist forces in Korea, he will not thereby cease to be a representative of the most tyrannical and bloodthirsty militarists in the United States. Using the flag of the United Nations to cover up aggression will not change the nature of the aggression, nor will it prevent this aggression from being an anti-peace conspiracy.

　　真理报发表国际评论
    斥美帝玷污联合国           
    利用联合国掩盖不了侵略的性质
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：马里宁在真理报国际评论中，揭露美国统治集团企图把朝鲜变为美国的桥头堡垒，并奴役整个朝鲜。
    马里宁写道：美国政府对朝鲜发动侵略时，显然过低估计了朝鲜人民的伟大力量。他们得到的回答是朝鲜一切爱国力量空前的团结，朝鲜人民已经站立起来为拯救祖国而进行正义的爱国战争。
    马里宁指出：应该按照联合国宪章负担维持国际和平与安全的主要责任的安理会，现在实际上扮演着美国参谋部的辅助机关的角色。美国统治集团把自命自封的国民党代表保持在安理会，就是这样使得两个大国的代表——苏联和中国——不可能参加安理会工作，把这个联合国最紧要的机构，变成了一种登记和执行美国命令的部门。
    马里宁强调指出：美国报纸不断叫嚣按照美国法西斯反动派魁首胡佛的计划“改组联合国”，归根结底就是要把联合国完完全全“美国化”，也就是正式使联合国与大西洋集团成为一体。
    马里宁结语说：即使把一个所谓“联合国军队”司令的头衔给予率领着在朝鲜的干涉军的麦克阿瑟，他也不会因此就不是美国最跋扈最嗜血的军国主义者的代表。利用联合国的旗帜来掩盖侵略，并不会改变侵略的性质，也不能使这个侵略不成其为反和平的阴谋。
