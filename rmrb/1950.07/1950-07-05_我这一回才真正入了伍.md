    At night, all the soldiers were sound asleep. Raindrops pattered against the window paper. I touched the blisters on my hands, my swollen shoulder, and lay in bed with my eyes closed, thinking wildly—home, school, life was so comfortable. I really wanted to desert and go back.

    But then I thought: on the dike, the soldiers were carrying earth, sweating, and saying to me, "Culture teacher, your body hasn't been trained, carry less, take a rest."

    On the march, the instructor said I had only been in the army for two months and hadn't walked the route, so he grabbed my backpack and carried it for me.

    The old landlady brought water for us to drink, saying, "You are working so hard day and night for us to have a good life, it's really too hard!" I finally chose the path of persevering.

    In order to organize the soldiers' cultural studies well, the higher authorities decided that the cultural instructor would participate in half-work, and prepare lessons at home in the afternoon. I was extremely happy, as this would give me a chance to rest.

    After a few days, a new kind of distress arose.

    On Thursday afternoon, I was preparing lessons in the yard when I heard a majestic song coming from the river dike: "...Building the dike, we must work harder! Hey ya! Hey ya! Strive to be heroes and role models, don't be bums or lazybones, never bow our heads when faced with difficulties... Hey ya! Hey ya!"

    "Don't be bums or lazybones," I felt this was being said directly to me.

    Suddenly, the street was bustling with voices. I knew the troops were back. I felt embarrassed because I hadn't worked, and I was ashamed to face the soldiers, so I quickly hid in the toilet.

    In the first half of the day, I followed the team to the work site as usual, but I always felt uneasy. While I was eating breakfast, Li Erwa said with a smile, "Can you eat steamed buns without production?" Zhao Xiaole said, "That's right! Can you eat four dishes without labor?" I lowered my head to eat, not daring to look at them, only feeling my head burning uncomfortably.

    Sometimes I thought: working together with everyone, leaving work together, talking and laughing, although a bit tiring, but I felt happy in my spirit.

    The emergency digging of the beach project began.

    I was still in a dream. "Da da! De da!" The reveille sounded. I opened my eyes and saw that the hands of the clock were just pointing to three thirty. I was very dissatisfied. The timetable clearly stipulated that work started at five o'clock, why were people being urged to get up at this time! I got up in a daze, the troops had already assembled and left. I chased after them, thinking: how unhappy will the soldiers be?

    But as soon as I arrived at the work site, it was completely beyond my expectations. Some of the soldiers were singing, some were shouting, everyone was very happy. It turned out that news had come in the middle of the night that the river water had come down, and it was difficult to extract soil from the riverbed. If we had to extract soil more than two hundred meters away, the project would be four or five times heavier, and it would be difficult to expect to complete the task.

    The branch convened the Party members to a meeting. I thought left and right at home, feeling there was no way.

    At five o'clock in the morning, the Party members took the lead in extracting soil from the water. Even the company commander and the instructor were digging out a basket of mud like they were catching fish and pouring it onto the dike. The more they worked, the more vigorously they worked, and the Saturday rest time was also sacrificed. Everyone was active and hardworking, without uttering a single complaint. In a few days, a beach dike section of more than three hundred meters, like the Great Wall, was built up.

    The superior qualities of the soldiers, their spirit of self-sacrifice for the cause of the people, educated me and encouraged me. Because my body had been exercised through labor and my thinking had progressed, I worked with everyone to the end in this way, and my relationship with the soldiers became harmonious. (The end)

　　我这一回才真正入了伍
    郭学诗
   （四）
    晚上战士们都睡熟了。雨点一滴滴地打在窗纸上。我摸了摸手上的泡、肿着的肩，闭了眼睛躺在床上乱想着——家里，学校里，生活多么安适。我真想开小差回去。
    可是，我又想到：在堤上战士们挑着土，流着汗，还对我说：“文化教员你身体没经过锻炼，少挑点，休息一下吧。”
    在行军的路上，指导员说我刚入伍两个月，没走过道，抢过我的背包替我背着。
    房东老大娘端着水给我们喝，说：“你们为俺们过好日子，这么一天到晚的劳动着，真太辛苦了！”我终于选择了干下去的道路。
   （五）
    为了组织好战士们的文化学习，上级决定文化教员参加半工，午后在家准备功课。我高兴极了，这一下可有了休息的机会了。
    过了几天，新的苦闷又产生了。
    礼拜四的下午，我正在院里准备课，听到雄壮的歌声从河堤上传来：“……修堤，咱们可多卖力气呀！嗨呀！嗨呀！争取英雄做模范，不当二流子不当懒汉，碰着困难不低头……嗨呀！嗨呀！”
    “不当二流子不当懒汉”，我觉得这正是对我说的。
    忽然，街上人声闹哄哄的，我知道是部队回来了。我觉着自己没干活，见了战士们不好意思，便急忙藏到厕所里。
    上半天，我照例跟着队伍到工段上去做工，但总觉得不自在。我吃早饭时李二娃笑着说：“不生产能吃上馒头吗？”赵小乐说：“是啊！不劳动能吃上四个菜吗？”我低着头吃饭不敢看他们，光觉着脑袋瓜火辣辣的难受。
    有时我想：和大家一起上工，一同下工，说说笑笑，虽然有些累，但是精神上却感到愉快。
   （六）
    抢挖滩工开始了。
    我还在梦里。“哒哒！的哒！”吹起了起床号。睁开眼一看，时针刚指着三点半。我很不满意。作息时间表上明明规定是五点钟上工，为什么这时候就催人们起床呢！我迷迷糊糊地爬起来，部队已经早集合走了。我一边追一边想：战士们会多么不高兴呢？
    可是一到工段，完全出乎我的意料之外。战士们有的唱着歌，有的喊着，大家都挺愉快。原来半夜里传来了消息，河水下来了，河底取土困难了。如到二百米以外取土，工程就要加重四五倍，很难预期完成任务。
    支部召集党员们去开会，我在家里左思右想，觉得没办法。
    早晨五点钟，党员们带头到水中取土，连长指导员也像摸鱼似的挖出一筐泥土向堤上倒。愈干愈凶，礼拜六的休息时间也牺牲了。大家都积极努力，没发出一句怨言。不几天，三百多米的滩工堤段，像长城一样的筑起来了。
    战士们的优越品质，他们对人民事业的自我牺牲精神教育了我，鼓励了我。由于身体经过劳动的锻炼和思想上的进步，我就这样和大家一起干到了底，和战士的关系也就融洽起来了。（续完）
