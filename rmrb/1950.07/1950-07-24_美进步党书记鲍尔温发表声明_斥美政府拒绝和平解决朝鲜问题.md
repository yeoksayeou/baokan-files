Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 22nd: TASS reports: Progressive Party Secretary Baldwin, in a statement to the press, vehemently denounced Truman's message to Congress and the government's rejection of proposals to end the Korean War.

Baldwin said: "Acheson flatly rejected Prime Minister Nehru's proposal to end the Korean War. Truman's message to Congress provides a glimpse of the price the American people will have to pay because of this refusal to peacefully resolve the Korean crisis! The plan outlined by the President will turn the United States into a strictly controlled military state prepared for global war. As the first cost of this plan, the President has requested an increase of $10 billion in the military budget; the removal of all restrictions on the size of our armed forces; and the shift of the nation's resources and manpower from peacetime production to wartime production.

Every American family will pay for this plan. The President is already asking for an increased tax burden on the people and a large reduction in government spending on social security... On the one hand, big businesses will increase their fairytale profits from lucrative new war contracts; on the other hand, every worker and farmer will begin to feel the pain as the prices of the goods they need rise... Not only will the American standard of living be greatly reduced, but American freedoms will also be severely curtailed. The House has already passed the Hobbs concentration camp bill; the shameful Mundt bill has been reintroduced in Congress; the House Un-American Activities Committee has subpoenaed labor leaders for "contempt" of Congress; and the right of railway workers to strike has been revoked... Many Americans already realize today, and millions more will know in the future: As our National Committee said, "The continuation of the Korean War is not in the interests of the American people, nor in the interests of world peace." Like Nehru, the Progressive Party suggests a peaceful resolution of the Korean crisis through the United Nations, the expulsion of the disgraced and defeated Kuomintang puppets, and the presence of representatives of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations to restore the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations.

We call on the American people to demand that the American government accept Nehru's proposal."

　　美进步党书记鲍尔温发表声明
    斥美政府拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：进步党书记鲍尔温在致报界的声明中，痛斥杜鲁门致国会咨文以及政府拒绝结束朝鲜战争的建议。
    鲍尔温说：“艾奇逊断然拒绝了尼赫鲁总理关于结束朝鲜战争的建议。杜鲁门的国会咨文使人可以稍稍预见，由于这一次拒绝和平解决朝鲜危机，美国人民必须付出多大的代价！总统所拟定的计划，将把美国弄成一个准备用来进行全球战争的严格管制下的军事国家。作为这个计划的第一批代价，总统已要求增加军事预算一百亿；取消对于我们武装部队数额的一切限制；把全国的物资与人力从平时生产转向战时生产。
    美国每一个家庭都将支付这个计划的用费。总统已经在要求加重人民的赋税负担和大量削减用于社会保险的政府支出。……一方面，大企业将从肥美的新战争的合同中，增加它们的童话似的利润，另一方面，每一个工人和农民都将因为他们所需要的物品价格上涨，而开始感受痛苦。……不但美国人的生活水准将大大降低，而且美国人的自由也将受到严重的剥夺。众院已经通过霍布斯集中营法案；可耻的蒙特法案再度列入国会的议程；众院非美活动委员会以“蔑视”国会为名传讯劳工领袖；铁路工人罢工的权利被取消。……许多美国人今天已经认识到，千百万美国人将来也会知道：正如我们的全国委员会所说的，“朝鲜战事的继续不符合美国人民的利益。也不符合世界和平的利益。”像尼赫鲁一样，进步党建议通过联合国的途径，和平解决朝鲜的危机，驱逐名誉扫地的被打败的国民党傀儡，使中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国，以恢复联合国的权威和效能。
    我们号召美国人民要求美国政府接受尼赫鲁的建议。”
