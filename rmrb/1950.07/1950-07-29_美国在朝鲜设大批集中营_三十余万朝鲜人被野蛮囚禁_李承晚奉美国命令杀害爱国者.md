　　U.S. Establishes Large Numbers of Concentration Camps in Korea
    More Than 300,000 Koreans Barbarically Imprisoned
    Syngman Rhee, Upon U.S. Orders, Massacres Patriots
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 27th, TASS dispatch: According to American newspapers, the American aggressors are extremely shocked by the scale of the Korean people's armed resistance against foreign aggressors. They are adopting barbaric means to deal with the people's guerrilla movement. *New York Times* reporter Johnston, reporting from Korea, stated that 58 concentration camps have already been established in the territory still held by the American aggressors, and 379,000 Koreans have been imprisoned in these concentration camps. Infectious diseases have begun to spread in the concentration camps.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 23rd, TASS dispatch: According to reliable sources: As a result of the victorious advance of the Korean People's Democratic Republic's People's Army, the South Korean military police, upon hints from the U.S. imperialists, have secretly ordered the murder of patriotic elements imprisoned in the prisons of Gwangju and Mokpo.
    When the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee gang, withdrew from Seoul, they murdered many patriotic elements. They committed the same crimes before fleeing from Suwon, Incheon, and other cities. Now, as Jeolla Buk-do and other provinces are about to be liberated, they are committing these despicable crimes again.

　　美国在朝鲜设大批集中营
    三十余万朝鲜人被野蛮囚禁           
    李承晚奉美国命令杀害爱国者
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：据美国报纸刊载，美国侵略者对朝鲜人民反对外国侵略者武装抵抗的规模，甚为震惊。他们采取野蛮的手段来对付人民游击运动。《纽约时报》记者约翰斯敦自朝鲜来讯称，在迄今尚在美国侵略者手中的领土内已经设立了五十八个集中营，并已有三十七万九千朝鲜人被关进这些集中营。集中营里已开始流行传染病。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十三日讯：据可靠消息：由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军队胜利进军的结果，南朝鲜宪兵从美帝国主义者那里得到暗示，已下密令杀害监禁在光州及木浦的监狱内的爱国分子。
    美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮于撤出汉城时，曾杀害过许多爱国分子。在他们从水原、仁川以及其他城市逃走之前，也犯了同样的罪行。现在当全罗北道和其他各道快要解放的时候，他们又在犯着这一卑鄙的罪行。
