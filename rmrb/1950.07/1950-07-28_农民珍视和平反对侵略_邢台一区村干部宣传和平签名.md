　　Peasants Cherish Peace, Oppose Aggression
　　Village Cadres in Xingtai First District Promote Peace Signature Drive
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to encourage the people of the Xingtai First District to sign the Peace Declaration, the district convened a meeting of the main cadres from each village and primary school teachers to discuss how to launch the campaign. After the meeting, each village convened meetings of Party members, cadres, and people's representatives to explain the significance of the peace signature movement and the key points of propaganda. The representatives and cadres used casual conversations to promote and mobilize people in various dining areas, and reported on the progress of the signature movement in various places on blackboard bulletins. After such preparation, a farmer named Wang said: "Peace is our eternal will, but the behavior of imperialism is very barbaric; peace-loving people must unite around the world's peace fortress! Around the Soviet Union, we will eliminate the aggressive behavior of American imperialism daring to provoke war. I have signed the names of my entire family, old and young, on the Peace Declaration." Youth League member Wang Qingxiu said: "Recently, I saw American imperialism using force to interfere in the Korean people's liberation cause and obstructing our liberation of Taiwan. I am determined to do a good job in production, support the front, and fight to the end to strive for the integrity of the national territory." Saying this, she indignantly signed the Peace Declaration. In Nankangzhuang Village, Xingtai County First District, 200 out of 800 men, women, and children in the entire village have signed.

　　农民珍视和平反对侵略
    邢台一区村干部宣传和平签名
    【本报讯】邢台一区为了争取该区人民在和平宣言上签名，召集各村主要干部和小学教员聚会，讨论如何展开宣传。会后，各村召开了党员、干部及人民代表会，说明和平签名运动的意义和宣传要点。代表们及干部在各片饭场，利用漫谈方式宣传动员，并在黑板报上报道各地签名运动的开展情况。经过这样的酝酿，一位姓王的农民说：“要和平是我们永远的意志，可是帝国主义的行为很蛮横；爱好和平的人民要团结在世界和平堡垒！苏联的周围，消灭美帝胆敢冒险挑拨战争的侵略行为。我已在和平宣言上把我全家老幼的名字都签上了。”青年团员王清秀说：“最近，我看到美帝武力干涉朝鲜人民解放事业，并阻挠我解放台湾，我坚决搞好生产，支援前线，为争取全国领土的完整而斗争到底。”说着她愤慨地在和平宣言上签了名。邢台县一区南康庄村，全村男女老幼八百人中签名已达二百人。
