　　Strengthen Mine Safety and Sanitation Facilities
    Labor Bureau Conducts Key Inspections
    Mentougou and Chengzi Coal Mines Have Made Initial Improvements
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Labor Bureau has begun to focus on inspecting the safety and sanitation facilities of various mines and factories. In March of this year, the bureau inspected the Mentougou and Chengzicun mines in western Beijing and proposed improvement plans. On June 5th, it sent personnel to the two mines again to inspect the implementation of the improvement plans. The inspection results showed that both mines had generally implemented the improvement plans, and the safety and sanitation facilities had been initially improved. Improvements include: The Mentougou Mine's gunpowder factory was too close to the workers' dormitories, making it very easy for explosions to occur. The mine has now moved this gunpowder factory to a newly built factory building. The underground wires in the Mentougou and Chengzi mines were all weatherproof wires. Because the underground is humid, most of the weatherproof wires leaked electricity, and the voltage was also too high (440 volts), making it extremely easy for workers to be electrocuted. Now, the mines have decided to switch to 110-volt voltage. The Mentougou Mine is purchasing transformers, and the Chengzi Mine is rectifying the lines—installing lamp holders, switch boxes, etc. In order to strengthen ventilation equipment, the Chengzi Mine is installing an electric fan, which is 80% complete. In the past, workers in both mines mostly drank water pumped from the mine shafts, resulting in many people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Now, boiled water has been prepared for the workers. The Mentougou Mine is also preparing to send personnel to the water company to learn chlorine disinfection methods so that workers can drink disinfected tap water. To strengthen medical equipment, the Beijing West Coal Mine Company has decided to build a hospital in the mining area. Preliminary surveys have been completed, and detailed plans are being drafted. The plan to install tap water in the entire mining area has also begun. In addition, improvements have also been made to the safety covers for pulleys and gears on machines, part of which have now been installed. The vertical shaft of the coal washing machine in the Mentougou Mine, which is prone to danger, has been covered with wooden boards. Isolation pools have been built in the bathhouses, which are prone to infectious diseases. The workers' canteens in both mines have been separated from the dormitories, and dedicated personnel clean the toilets in all locations.

　　加强矿厂安全卫生设施
    劳动局进行重点检查
    门头沟及城子两煤矿已经初步改善
    【京市新闻处讯】京市劳动局已开始有重点地检查各矿厂的安全卫生设施。今年三月间该局检查了京西门头沟、城子村两矿并提出改进方案；六月五日又派员前往两矿检查执行改进方案的情况。检查结果，两矿一般都已按着改进方案实行，安全卫生设施，已获初步改善。已经得到改善的如：门头沟矿制火药厂，距工人宿舍太近，很容易发生爆炸的危险，该矿现已将此制药厂迁到一所新建的厂房内。门矿和城矿井下电线都是风雨线，因井下潮湿，风雨线大都走电，同时电压也太大（四四○伏脱），极易使工人触电。现在各矿都已决定改用一一○伏脱电压，门矿正在购置变压器，城矿正在整顿线路——加装灯口、闸盒等。城矿为加强通风设备，并正按装电风扇一部，已完成百分之八十。又如两矿工人，过去大都饮用矿井下抽出来的水，因而很多人患了肠胃病，现在已为工人预备开水。门矿并准备派员去自来水公司学习用氯气消毒的方法，以便使工人饮用消毒的自来水。为加强医疗设备，京西煤矿公司已决定在矿区建立医院一所，现已初步勘查完毕，正在草拟详细计划。整个矿区按装自来水计划，现在也已着手进行。此外，已经得到改善的还有：机器上皮带轮及齿轮的安全罩子，现在已装好了一部分；门矿选煤机容易发生危险的立轴，已用木板遮蔽；容易传染疾病的浴堂，修了隔离池；两矿工人食堂已与宿舍分开，各处厕所都有专人打扫等。
