Developing Primary and Secondary Education in Northeast China

By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng

            Farmers Run Schools Themselves

After the land reform in Northeast China, the economic life of farmers has generally improved, and the demand for cultural learning is growing. Because farmers have suffered the pain of illiteracy for generations, they want their children to receive education. In the past, they only hoped to send their sons to school, but now they even want to send their daughters to school.

In order to help farmers realize these demands, the Northeast People's Government actively implemented the policy of restoring and developing primary school education and enrolling children of workers and peasants. It also promulgated measures to reward people for running schools, in order to supplement the government's limited manpower and resources.

In Daguchengzi Village, Third District, Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, after becoming masters of their own fate for the first time, the liberated farmers enthusiastically rebuilt a primary school in the village that had been destroyed during the enemy-puppet regime. This spring, they requested the addition of senior grades. Understanding the government's financial difficulties, the farmers voluntarily solved the funding problem. Since last summer, they have been tightening their belts and developing sideline production to cover all the expenses of the complete primary school. However, the district government disregarded the masses' demands and did not approve the farmers' request to add senior grades. This aroused dissatisfaction among the farmers in the whole village, who jointly signed a letter to the Northeast People's Government. After an investigation by the Northeast Education Department, it was determined that the farmers' request in Daguchengzi Village was not only reasonable, but also that their enthusiasm for running schools was deeply worthy of praise.

After the news of Daguchengzi Village running a school spread, farmers in many places also enthusiastically and automatically started schools. According to statistics from fifty-eight counties in Liaodong, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, there are currently 516 schools run by the people, with over 63,000 students. At present, the main issue for these farmer-run schools is strengthening leadership.

            Moving Towards Universalization

Primary and secondary education in Northeast China has greatly developed in 1950. There are now 34,412 primary schools in Northeast China, with over 4,543,000 students. The number of students has increased by 18.61% compared to last year. In many places, the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached 60% or even 70% or more. In terms of secondary schools (including normal schools), there are currently 248 schools, with over 161,300 students (including normal school students). (This does not include 24 private schools with over 9,900 students.) The number of students has increased by 36.79% compared to last year. This lays a good foundation for universal education.

In order to take care of over-age children's enrollment and universalize compulsory education, Northeast China has also established over-age children training classes. In Jiamusi, Dalian, Shenyang, and other places, according to incomplete statistics, there are already over 700 classes with over 30,000 students.

Due to the implementation of the policy of facing workers and peasants in primary and secondary education in Northeast China, a large number of children of workers and peasants have entered schools, and the composition of students has greatly changed. According to statistics from the first semester of 1949, children of workers and peasants accounted for 51% of primary school students and 28% of secondary school students. In 1950, the proportion of children of workers and peasants in secondary schools increased again. For example, in Shenyang, children of workers and peasants account for 52% of the new students in the first grade of junior high school, 84% of junior normal school students, and 30% of senior high school students. In Anshan, children of workers and peasants account for over 73% of the new students in secondary schools. The demand for the enrollment of children of workers and peasants has been gradually met.

The large-scale enrollment of children of workers and peasants and their unprecedented enthusiasm for learning have greatly improved the political and cultural level of primary and secondary school students in Northeast China. Over the past year, ideas of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property have gradually been established among students. In terms of cultural learning, the number of students failing exams has greatly decreased. The Chinese language proficiency of primary school students has generally improved. Generally, they can write articles of 400 characters, and some can write 800 characters. First-year junior high school students can generally write fluent and thoughtful articles of 700 to 800 characters, and some can write over 1,000 characters. Moreover, the "Concord Language" created during the Japanese puppet era has been eliminated, and misspelled words have also been reduced.

At the same time, Northeast China established four worker-peasant rapid secondary schools in Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin this year, with over 480 students in 14 classes. Workers, peasants, and revolutionary soldiers account for over 90% of the total number of students. In particular, among the 148 students in the worker-peasant rapid secondary school in Dalian, all except 16 are young workers. These students from worker-peasant backgrounds showed great enthusiasm and a spirit of research in their studies and achieved remarkable progress.

            Improving Teaching Quality

The teaching quality of primary and secondary schools in Northeast China has gradually improved.

The first step is to streamline the curriculum and adapt and compile new textbooks for primary and secondary schools. Because the original secondary school curriculum was extremely heavy, and there were too many class hours and extracurricular activities, the students were burdened. Not only could they not digest what they learned, but it also affected their health. In order to correct this shortcoming, it was decided to implement a streamlined curriculum and reduce class hours. This spring, general secondary schools in Northeast China have no more than 30 class hours per week, and extracurricular activities are six hours per week. The junior high school curriculum has reduced mineralogy, trigonometry, world history, and world geography, and these subjects have been moved to senior high school. Senior high school has reduced calculus and analytic geometry, and normal school has reduced introduction to education and statistics and testing.

Since Northeast China has entered a period of economic construction, in order to adapt to this new situation and new tasks, the Northeast Education Department began to systematically and gradually revise primary and secondary school textbooks, with production and construction as the central content. Among them, primary school arithmetic and nature are recompiled with reference to Soviet primary school nature and arithmetic. Because the past old textbooks for secondary school natural science courses were outdated and divorced from reality, and were very unsuitable for the current construction of new China, new compiled Soviet ten-year middle school (grades 5 to 7) natural science courses have been adopted in junior high schools since this spring. These courses basically meet the needs of our New Democratic education. The purpose of the new teaching materials is very clear. For example, the old teaching materials for botany only talked about the scope of plant research without mentioning the purpose of research, while the new teaching materials first stated that "botany is the science of discussing plants and managing plants," and pointed out that "every cultivated plant is cultivated under the conditions it needs for life, and only under these conditions can we obtain abundant harvests." It also emphasized that Michurin's theory is the direction of the advancement of biology. The newly compiled teaching materials are more in line with the inherent logic of each science and implement the principles of scientific teaching in the organization and sequence of content. For example, the zoology in the new teaching materials first starts with the simplest unicellular protozoa and continues to the most complex higher mammals, while the old teaching materials go in reverse. The content of the new teaching materials fully implements the combination of theory and practice. For example, botany is linked to agricultural improvement, and zoology is linked to animal husbandry. In terms of teaching methods, special attention is paid to students' experiments and observations. The students’ observation, research, and operational abilities are cultivated through planned homework and practice.

The second step is to improve the quality of teachers. Teachers in primary and secondary schools in Northeast China have made progress in their thinking in the past two years. At present, the main task is to strengthen learning. In addition to intensive training during the holidays, teaching and research seminars are also held to organize teachers to conduct political theory and professional learning. The content of political theory learning is the history of social development and political economy, while professional learning is conducted through teaching groups of various subjects in combination with the teaching business of the subject. These methods have been very effective in improving the quality of teachers. At present, some provinces and cities in Northeast China have opened teachers' spare-time remedial schools for planned improvement. For example, Harbin has set up a teachers' night school, offering Chinese and mathematics classes, and Shenyang has set up a teachers' spare-time refresher school to study politics and business.

The third step is to examine teaching ideas and improve teaching methods. The Northeast Education Department has conducted inspections of Chinese and biology teaching and held research meetings on Chinese and biology teaching to review the formalism and dogmatism in Chinese and biology teaching. For example, when teaching Chinese, only focusing on the literal meaning, emphasizing writing techniques, and separating the form of language from the content of thought; when teaching biology, not combining it with external conditions, students memorize notes and recite articles during exams, and cannot apply them in practice. Another deviation is not paying attention to theory and excessively emphasizing object teaching. Some teachers believe that if there are no live objects in teaching, the students’ requirements cannot be met, and they believe that specimens and models are dead and have little effect. Some teachers deleted what they did not have live objects in at the time and place and did not talk about it. Northeast China has paid attention to correcting these deviations.

In addition, in terms of improving teaching, in order to pay attention to the combination of theory and practice, the Northeast Education Department has purchased a large number of physics and chemistry instruments, biological models, and various wall charts and books and distributed them to various schools this year. Many teachers and students in the schools have also started to make their own instruments and collect some specimens, which has also increased the good conditions for teaching.

At present, primary and secondary education in Northeast China is developing day by day. The main problem in the future should be the cultivation of teachers. The quality of teaching must be improved by improving the quality of teachers, so that primary and secondary education in Northeast China can develop further.

　　发展中的东北中小学教育
    本报记者  柏生
            农民自己办学校
    土地改革后的东北，农民经济生活普遍上升，要求学习文化的热潮日益高涨。农民因为自己世世代代的受了不识字的痛苦，因此要求自己的儿女们能够受到教育。以前他们只盼着能把自己的小子送去上学，现在连自己的姑娘也要送去上学了。
    东北人民政府为了帮助农民实现这些要求，积极的执行了恢复与发展小学教育，吸收工农子女入学的方针。并颁布了奖励人民办教育的办法，以补政府人力物力之不足。
    在辽西省新民县第三区大古城子村，翻身农民因为自己头一次做了主人，他们热心而兴奋地动手把村里的一个为敌伪时所破坏的小学重新建立起来，并在今春请求添设高级班。农民们体谅政府经费困难，自愿解决经费问题。从去年夏季他们就节衣缩食，开展副业生产，负担了完小的全部经费。但该区政府却不顾群众的要求，对该村农民请求添设高级班不给予批准。因此激起全村农民的不满，联合签名上书东北人民政府，后经东北教育部派人调查后，认为大古城子村农民的请求不但是合理的，而且这种热心兴办学校的精神是深深值得表扬的。
    大古城子村办学校的消息传出后，不少地方农民也热烈地自动兴办学校。据辽东、吉林、黑龙江三省五十八县的统计，现有民办学校共五百一十六所，学生已达六万三千余名。目前这些农民自办的学校，主要是注意加强领导的问题。
            走向普及
    一九五○年的东北中小学教育，已经有了很大的发展。现在全东北有小学三万四千四百一十二所，学生达四百五十四万三千余人。学生人数比去年增加了百分之一八·六一。有许多地方学龄儿童入学已达百分之六十甚至七十以上。中学方面（包括师范）现有学校二百四十八所，学生（包括师范生）有十六万一千三百余人（其中私立学校二十四所，学生有九千九百余人尚未包括在内），人数比去年增加了百分之三十六·七九。这给普及教育打下了一个良好的基础。
    为了照顾超龄儿童的入学；普及义务教育，东北更举办了超龄儿童训练班，在佳木斯、旅大、沈阳等地，据不完全的统计已有七百余班，三万多学生。
    东北中小学教育由于执行了面向工农的方针，大批工农子女涌进了学校，学生的成份已经有很大的改变。一九四九年上学期统计，小学中工农子女占百分之五十一，中学中工农子女占总数的百分之二十八。一九五○年中学学生工农子女所占比例又已增大，如沈阳市初中一年级新生中，工农子女占百分之五十二，初中师范生占百分之八十四，高中占百分之三十。鞍山市中学新生中，工农子女占百分之七十三多。已逐渐达到了满足工农子弟入学的要求。
    工农子弟的大批入学，和他们的学习情绪的空前高涨，使东北中小学生的政治、文化水平都有很大的提高。一年来，在学生中间已逐渐树立了爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的思想。在文化学习方面，学生考试不及格的情形大为减少。高小学生国文水平都普遍提高了一步，一般都能写上四百字的文章，多的能写八百字。初中一年级学生一般能写七、八百字的通顺而有思想内容的文章，好的能写上千字。而且消灭了日伪时代造成的协和语，也减少了错白字。
    同时，今年东北更在沈阳、大连、哈尔滨三地创办了四所工农速成中学，有学生四百八十余人，共分十四班。其中工人、农民和革命军人三种成份占全体学生的百分之九十以上。特别在大连的工农速成中学的一百四十八名学生中，除十六人外其余全部为青年工人。这些工农出身的学生，他们在学习中表现了高度的热情和钻研的精神，获得了惊人的进步。
            提高教学质量
    东北中小学的教学质量逐渐提高了。
    首先是精简课程，改编与新编中、小学教材。因为原有的中学课程极繁重，而且上课时间过多，课外的活动也多，使得学生负担很重，不但学了不能消化，而且影响身体的健康。为了纠正这个缺点，便决定实行精简课程，减少上课时间。今春东北一般中学每周上课都未超过三十小时，课外活动每周六小时。初中课程减少了矿物、三角、世界历史、世界地理等，把这些科目都移到高中教，高中减去了微积分、解析几何，师范减去了教育概论、统计与测验等。
    由于东北已转入经济建设时期，为了适应这新形势与新任务，东北教育部开始有计划地逐步地将中小学课本加以修改，以生产建设为中心内容。其中小学算术及自然是参照苏联小学自然和算术重编的。中学自然科学课本，因为过去的旧课本观点陈旧脱离实际，与目前新中国的建设很不适合，因此自今春起，初中已开始采用新编译的苏联十年制中学（第五至七年级）的自然科学课程。这些课程，基本上是切合我们新民主主义教育的需要的。新教材的目的性很明确。如植物学中对于教学目的的论述，旧的教材中只讲了植物所研究的范围，而未提出研究的目的，而新教材则首先说明“植物学是论述植物和管理植物的科学”，又指出了“每一种栽培植物全是在它生活所需要的那些条件下去栽培，只有在这些条件下，我们才能得到丰富的收获”，并且着重说明了米邱林学说是生物学前进的方向。新编译的教材在内容的组织顺序和系统上，更是符合于各门科学内在的逻辑性，和贯彻着科学的教学原则，如新教材中的动物学首先是由最简单的单细胞原生动物讲起，顺着动物的发展一直讲到最复杂的高等哺乳动物，而旧教材则是逆着讲下来的。新教材的内容更是充分的贯彻着理论与实际的结合，如植物学就连系到农业的改良，动物学就连系到家畜的饲养工作。教学方法上又特别重视学生的实验、观察，有计划的通过作业实习，培养学生的观察、研究与操作的能力。
    其次是提高教员质量的问题，东北中小学教员在思想方面最近这两年是有进步的。目前主要是加强学习。除了假期集训学习外，并采取了各科教学研究会的方式，组织教员进行政治理论与业务学习。政治理论学习内容为社会发展史和政治经济学，业务学习则通过各科教学小组结合本科教学业务进行研讨。通过这些方式提高师资质量，效果很好。目前在东北有些省、市，已开办了教师业余补习学校，作有计划的提高，如哈尔滨设立了教师夜校，开办了国文、数学两种班次，沈阳市办了教师业余进修学校，学习政治和业务。
    第三是进行检查教学思想和改进教学方法。东北教育部对国文、生物教学都已进行了检查，召开了国文和生物教学研究会议，检讨了国文、生物教学中的形式主义、教条主义。譬如讲国文单从字面上兜圈子，重文字技术，把语文形式与思想内容分开，讲生物学不和外界条件相结合，学生考试时把笔记背一背，死记条文，不能实际应用等。另外一个偏向是不重理论，过分强调实物教学。有的教员认为教学中如没有活的实物，便不能满足学生要求，认为标本、模型都是死的，作用不大，有的教员把当时当地没有活实物的就删去不讲了。以上这些偏向现在东北都已注意纠正了。
    此外，在改进教学方面，为了注意理论与实际的结合，东北教育部今年更购置了大批理化仪器，生物模型，以及各种挂图、图书分配给各学校。而许多学校师生更动手自己制造仪器和采集了一些标本，这也增加了教学的良好条件。
    目前东北中小学教育在逐日发展中，今后主要的问题应该是培养师资问题，必须从提高师资来提高教学质量，使东北中小学教育再向前发展一步。
