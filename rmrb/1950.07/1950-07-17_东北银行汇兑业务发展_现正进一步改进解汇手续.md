　　Northeast Bank Develops Remittance Business
    Now Further Improving Remittance Procedures
    [This newspaper, Shenyang] Since the first quarter of this year, the remittance business of the Northeast Bank has been developing month by month. Taking the number of correspondent banks as an example, in June, the number of locations in the Northeast that could remit to the interior increased by 78 compared to the end of last year, and by 2 in the Inner Mongolia region; the number of locations in the interior that could remit to the Northeast increased by 44, the number in the Dalian and Lushun area increased by 7, and the number in Inner Mongolia increased by 126. The number of branches handling telegraphic transfers within the Northeast region also increased by 34, and by 43 compared to the end of last year. In addition, for industrial and mining areas far from banks, mobile remittance teams were organized by nearby banks to handle postal remittances, which is very convenient for employees to send money home. According to statistics on the amount of money received in April (generally a slow month for remittances), the amount of remittances received was more than 34% higher than the amount received in January (a peak month).
    The smooth flow of remittance business has indirectly promoted the active exchange of materials in various regions and the flexible transfer between public enterprises and settlement units, which has played a mutually supportive role in achieving economic accounting and moving towards a planned economy for various enterprises.
    Regarding the purpose of remittances between the interior and exterior; according to incomplete statistics from the Shanhaiguan Joint Office of the Northeast Bank of the People's Bank of China at the end of the first quarter (small postal remittances and private and commercial transactions are not included), remittances to the interior are mainly for the purchase of machine parts, accounting for more than 55% of the total, cotton yarn and cloth accounting for 12%, and other items mainly including paper, chemical instruments, medical supplies and general merchandise. Remittances from the interior to the Northeast are mainly for grain, accounting for 63% of the total, timber accounting for 13%, and other items including machinery, furs, local products, oils and sugars. In view of the increasing development and needs of remittance business, the head office of the Northeast Bank has decided that all remittance fees within the Northeast region will be waived from late June; as for handling fees, public funds such as those belonging to the military, government agencies, organizations, public enterprises, cooperatives, and schools, as well as living expenses for employees and teachers, will be exempt regardless of the amount of the remittance, and the handling fee for general remittances will be reduced from the original 50,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan (Northeast currency) per transaction, which is only equivalent to subsidizing the postage for registered letters used for remittances. If there is a current deposit account established at the bank, the remittance handling fee can be reduced or waived at the discretion of the bank.
    In addition, in order to overcome the shortcomings of delayed and accumulated internal remittance reports with various cash collection units' remittances and settlement units' allocations, which affected the timely transfer of funds after currency recall, the bank has also studied and improved the procedures. The internal remittance report will be sealed and handed to the remitter to carry to the receiving unit to complete the transfer procedures. For general remittance reports, the staff at the window will send them out by express mail as they are processed, without going through the intermediate procedures of general receipt and distribution, so as not to affect the recipient's collection time.

### 东北银行汇兑业务发展  现正进一步改进解汇手续

　　东北银行汇兑业务发展
    现正进一步改进解汇手续
    【本报沈阳讯】东北银行由今年第一季度开始，汇兑业务逐月发展。以通汇点来说，六月份比去年末，东北对关内增加了七十八处，对内蒙区增加了二处；关内对东北区增加了四十四处，旅大地区增加七处，内蒙增加一百二十六处。东北区内联行间也增加了三十四处，同时增办电汇的支行处也比去年末增加了四十三处。另外对距离银行较远的工矿地区，亦由就近银行组织了流动汇款组，专门办理票汇汇款，故一般职工向家寄款颇为称便。根据四月份的收款额统计（一般汇兑情况是淡月）还比一月份收汇额（比较是旺月）增加了百分之三四强。
    汇兑业务的畅通，间接促成了各地物资交流的活跃，与公营企业和结算单位间往来调拨的灵活，对各企业达到经济核算和走向计划经济起了互相配合的作用。
    对于关内外汇款用途方面；根据第一季度末中国人民银行东北银行山海关联合办事处不完全的统计（邮局小额汇款和私人、商号间往来未计），向关内汇款主要为购买机器零件，占总额百分之五五强，花纱布占百分之一二，其他则以纸张、化学仪器、医药百货等居多。关内向东北汇款主要是粮谷，占总额百分之六三，木材占百分之十三，其他为机器、毛皮、土产、油脂及糖类等。东北银行总行鉴于汇兑业务的日益开展和需要，特决定东北区内的汇解款，由六月下旬起一律免收汇费；至于手续费方面，属于部队、机关、团体、公营企业、合作社、学校等公款及职工公教人员之赡家费，不论汇额多少一律免收，并对于一般汇款的手续费，亦由原定每笔五万元改为三万元（东北币），这仅等于补助汇款用挂号信的邮资。如果在银行立有往来存款户者，其汇款手续费尚可酌情减免。
    此外，银行为克服以往与各回笼单位之上解款和结算单位之划拨款，因银行内部解汇报告寄递迟缓和积压，致影响货币回笼后不能及时转账的缺点，亦同时研究改进了手续。即将内部解款报告，实行密封交与解款人自行携带持向收款单位办理转账手续。对一般的汇款报告，亦采取了由窗口经办人员随办随以快邮寄出，不另经过一般收发的中间手续，以免影响收款人的领取时间。
