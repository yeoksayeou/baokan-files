Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th—Labor youth in factories, mines, and offices in northern Korea are organizing youth front-line work teams to coordinate with the heroic advance of the People's Army on the front lines. Youth front-line work teams everywhere are extending daily working hours, changing from three shifts to two shifts. The youth front-line work team at the Haeju Railway Sub-bureau has increased its daily production quota from 113% of the pre-war level to 205% since July 7th. Among them, the Li Xiangjia work team of the lathe workshop and the casting workshop exceeded the daily quota by 215%. Young workers at the Ruihe Mine organized ten front-line work teams from the 7th to carry out production increase sprints on Sundays and during extra working hours.

Labor youth and students in rural North Korea have also organized support-the-front-line shock brigades. Young farmers in Bicheng County, in order to reclaim the wasteland along the 38th parallel that had been ravaged and abandoned by the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army for several years, organized land reclamation shock brigades from July 1st to carry out reclamation work. Students in Haeju City also used their summer vacation to organize more than 1,300 shock brigade members to go to nearby rural areas with insufficient labor to help farmers plant rice seedlings and weed.

At the same time, children in North Korea launched a movement to donate "Young Pioneer" airplanes and tanks. On the 14th, more than 300 Young Pioneer members of the 14th People's School in Pyongyang held a rally. Many boys and girls gave speeches at the meeting. Park Shanfeng said: "American imperialism is attempting to seize the land and factories of our parents, destroy the free schools that nurture outstanding children of our motherland, and destroy our happy future, and has launched a military attack on us. We will never allow such barbaric behavior. We must learn from the loyalty, courage, and dedication of the Soviet Young Pioneers in the Great Patriotic War and dedicate all our strength to the front lines, sending "Young Pioneer" airplanes and tanks to the front." His call was immediately enthusiastically supported by all the children and has become the current action slogan of all children in Korea.

　　朝鲜人民积极支援前线
    劳动青年积极工作突击增产
    儿童展开捐献飞机坦克运动
    【新华社平壤十九日电】朝鲜北部的各工厂、矿山与机关的劳动青年，正以组织青年前线工作班运动，来配合前线人民军的英勇进军。各处的青年前线工作班，延长每日工作时间，将三次交待制改为两次交待制。海州机务段的青年前线工作班，自七月七日起将一日的生产定额从战前的百分之一一三增长到百分之二零五。其中旋盘工场的李相甲工作班和铸物工作班，以百分之二一五超过完成每日的定额。瑞兴矿山的青年工人从七日起组织了十个前线工作班，以星期日和额外劳动时间进行增产突击。
    北朝鲜农村的劳动青年和学生，亦纷纷组织支援前线突击队。碧城县的青年农民为了开垦几年来被李承晚匪军摧残而荒废的三八沿线的荒地，从七月一日起组织了开荒突击队进行开垦工作。海州市的学生也利用暑假组织了一千三百余名的突击队，到附近劳动力不足的农村，帮助农民插秧锄草。
    与此同时，北朝鲜的少年儿童们展开了献纳“少年号”飞机和坦克的运动。十四日，平壤市第十四人民学校的少年团员三百余人召开奋起大会，会上许多男女少年都发表演说，朴善峰说道：“美帝国主义企图夺取我们父母的土地和工厂，摧残养育我祖国优秀儿女的自由学园，毁灭我们幸福的将来，而向我们发动了武力进攻。我们决不容许这种野蛮行为，我们要学习苏联少年先锋队在卫国战争中的忠诚勇敢和献身性，将我们全部力量奉献给前线，把“少年号”的飞机坦克送到前方去。”他的号召立即得到全体少年的热烈拥护，并已成为目前全朝鲜少年的行动口号。
