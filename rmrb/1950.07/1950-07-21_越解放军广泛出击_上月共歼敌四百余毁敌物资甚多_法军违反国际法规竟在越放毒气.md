(Xinhua News Agency, 20th) Comprehensive reports from the Vietnam News Agency: In June, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army fought on all fronts in Vietnam, achieving multiple victories. In North Vietnam, the Liberation Army launched extensive offensives against the French colonial army in provinces such as Cao Bang, Thai Binh, Ha Nam, and Nam Dinh, killing over 400 French troops and capturing four French military strongholds. The Liberation Army mobile units in Hai Phong, a major seaport in North Vietnam, burned a French landing craft and 34,000 liters of gasoline. On June 26, the Liberation Army repelled a fierce French attack in the Cao Bang province and shot down a French fighter plane.

In South Vietnam, on June 5, the Liberation Army intercepted a French supply convoy, destroying multiple French vehicles and seizing a large quantity of food. On June 11, South Vietnamese guerrillas stormed a French colonist's rubber plantation in Bien Hoa province, burning 34,200 kilograms of raw rubber. At the end of June, the Liberation Army destroyed 20 French vehicles in Thu Dau Mot province.

In Central Vietnam, at the end of June, the Liberation Army annihilated a French motorized unit in an area 100 miles north of Hue and repelled French airborne troops attempting to protect the unit. The Liberation Army seized a large quantity of French weapons and equipment in the area.

Amidst the continuous victories of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army, the number of French officers and soldiers defecting is increasing daily. According to statistics, in the first half of this year, 600 French regular soldiers and auxiliary troops defected to the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army. Before defecting, they killed multiple French commanders, destroyed 51 French military strongholds, and brought with them 357 machine guns and submachine guns, nearly 1,000 rifles, and 5 mortars.

(Xinhua News Agency, 20th) According to a TASS report citing the Vietnam News Agency: The French colonialists have blatantly violated international law and recently, in a heinous act, have been indiscriminately using poison gas in the liberated areas of Vietnam, massacring peaceful Vietnamese residents. On June 26, seventeen French fighter planes and transport planes dropped a large number of poison gas bombs in the villages of Ha Nhai (transliteration) and Nguyen Binh (transliteration) near Cao Bang City in North Vietnam, and on the Cao Bang-Hanoi highway, killing many peaceful Vietnamese residents.

    上月共歼敌四百余毁敌物资甚多 
    法军违反国际法规竟在越放毒气
    【新华社二十日讯】综合越南通讯社报道：六月间，越南人民解放军在全越各地作战，获得多次胜利。在北越，解放军先后在高平、太平、河南及南定等省广泛进攻法国殖民军，共毙法军四百余名，并攻克法军据点四处。解放军机动部队在北越重要海港海防焚毁法军登陆艇一艘及汽油三万四千公升。六月二十六日，解放军在高平省地区击退法军猛烈的攻击，并击落法军战斗机一架。
    在南越，解放军于六月五日截击法军给养运输队，击毁法军汽车多辆，截获大批食物。六月十一日，南越游击队冲进边和省一处法国殖民者的橡胶园，焚毁生胶三万四千二百公斤。六月底，解放军在首油没省击毁法军汽车二十辆。
    在中越，解放军于六月底在顺化以北一百英里的地区，歼灭法军摩托化部队一队，并击退了企图保护该队的法军空军降落伞部队。解放军在该地区缴获了法军大批武器与装备。
    在越南人民解放军的不断获胜声中，法军官兵投诚者日增。据统计，今年上半年，有六百名法国正规军及其辅助军向越南人民解放军投诚，他们在投诚前曾杀死法军司令官多名，摧毁法军据点五十一处，带来机枪、冲锋枪三百五十七挺，步枪近一千支及迫击炮五门。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社引越南通讯社消息：法国殖民主义者罪恶昭彰地违反了国际法规，最近竟在越南解放区滥放毒气，屠杀越南和平居民。六月二十六日，十七架法国战斗机与运输机在北越高平城附近的河亚（译音）村与阮宾（译音）村，并在高平——河内公路上投掷大量毒气弹，杀害了许多越南的和平居民。
