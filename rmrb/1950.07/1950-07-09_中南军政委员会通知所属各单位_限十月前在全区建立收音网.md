The Central and Southern Military and Political Committee Notifies Subordinate Units
Limit for Establishing Radio Networks Throughout the Region is October
[Our Newspaper] Following the Central People's Government News Administration's announcement regarding the decision to establish a radio network, the leading Party, government, and military organs in the Central and Southern Region have attached great importance to this work. On May 13th, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee's Central and Southern Bureau issued a "Notice on Establishing Radio Stations." On June 26th, Lin Biao, Chairman of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, also issued a notice, limiting the universal establishment of radio stations throughout the Central and Southern Region before October. It stipulates that each county's radio station must receive and transcribe the government orders, announcements, and important news released by the Central Station, the Central and Southern Station, and the provincial stations, and rapidly disseminate them to the masses through various means.

The Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, in its notice, clarifies the importance of establishing a radio network and calls upon the leading organs of each province to fully utilize this propaganda and education tool.

The Central People's Government News Administration has already issued a decision on establishing a national radio network on April 23rd. This is one of the most important organizational tasks in our Central and Southern Region's news work recently. Our Central and Southern Region has the largest population among the major administrative regions, a vast area, inconvenient transportation, and is mostly a newly liberated area with a large number of illiterate people. Newspaper delivery and distribution in each province are difficult. In particular, after most of the newspapers in the special districts were suspended, the vast rural areas often did not receive newspapers, or received them too late. This has resulted in the majority of the masses not understanding the current situation, government laws, and policies, or relying on hearsay, distorted rumors. Reactionary landlords, bandits, and special agents take this opportunity to constantly create rumors and deceive the masses, thereby affecting the implementation of government orders. Lower-level working cadres also cannot receive timely instructions from higher levels, often placing them in a passive position at work, or they cannot change their working methods in time, resulting in various unnecessary losses in their work. In addition, they are busy with work and have a lower level of education, making it difficult for them to read newspapers, which is detrimental to the country and the people in the long run. Based on the above situations, the work of establishing radio stations throughout the Central and Southern Region is truly urgent. Therefore, the leading organs of each province must understand the importance of fully utilizing radio stations for work and universally establishing radio stations. They must understand the use of this modern leadership tool to quickly and conscientiously overcome the handicraft-style approach that has been left over from past rural work. Governments at all levels and relevant departments must earnestly implement the work of establishing radio stations and actively organize the listening to government orders and important news released by the Central and Southern Station and the provincial stations, and rapidly disseminate them to the masses through mimeographed newspapers, blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, and other forms, in order to improve administrative efficiency, rapidly implement government orders, grasp mass movements, and educate cadres and the masses. In this way, every important government order, instruction, or major domestic and international event of the Central and Southern Region and the provincial people's governments will be quickly transmitted to every corner of the region, which will play a significant role in promoting work. Therefore, the notice stipulates that the following tasks must be completed by the provinces and cities of Central and Southern Region before October:

	(1) Before July 10th, complete an accurate survey of all radio receivers in all counties and cities under the jurisdiction of each province. In principle, each county should set up one radio receiver (larger towns can also set up one); large and medium-sized cities should set up radio receivers in units of organs, groups, and schools.

	(2) Complete the purchase and distribution of radio receivers. In principle, half of the purchase cost of these radio receivers will be paid from the broadcasting funds of each province and city, and half will be borne by the local funds of each province and city. In 1950, all broadcasting stations in the provinces and cities will stop construction, and the broadcasting funds allocated by the major administrative regions will be mainly used for this construction.

	(3) Each county must quickly appoint two full-time or part-time radio operators and complete the training of radio operators before the end of August.

	(4) The work of each county's radio station is stipulated to be the reception and transcription of news from the Central Station, the Central and Southern Station, and the respective provincial stations, and at least the important content of government orders, announcements, news, commentaries, speeches, and Wuhan and Guangzhou newspaper abstracts broadcast by the above stations should be summarized and sent to the county-level leading organs, and quickly disseminated to the masses through mimeographed newspapers, blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, and other forms. Other programs can be organized for the masses to listen to, and important broadcast content should be previewed daily.

Finally, the notice points out: "In order to quickly disseminate the listened government orders and news to the masses, each county's radio station must do the following two tasks well:

	1. Transmission of Mimeographed Newspapers: Organize all forces, such as county post offices, cadres working in the countryside, elementary school students, etc., to quickly convey the information without backlog or suppression to save time, so as to quickly transmit the news to various districts and villages.

	2. Widely Organize Blackboard Newspapers: The county people's education center should regard this work as a central task in recent months, requiring each administrative village and market town to establish a blackboard newspaper. The content of the blackboard newspaper should include: in addition to the important government orders and announcements of this province, major domestic and international news, it should also regularly report on the work situation and typical figures in the district and village, criticisms and commendations of deeds, mass opinions, as well as general policies and regulations, and coordinate with the central work in the local area to promote work. The leadership of this work should be headed by the district cultural and educational assistant to organize a blackboard newspaper management committee, regularly organize the implementation of this work, and widely organize elementary school teachers to participate in this work. After the establishment of local radio stations, workers in local people's education centers must set up as many blackboard newspapers as possible to facilitate dissemination. The text of the blackboard newspaper must uniformly adopt regular script. In places where special district-level local newspapers have been abolished (including some small and medium-sized cities), the blackboard newspaper has become one of the main tools for leaders at all levels to unite and educate the masses, and must be valued, and capable cadres should be sent to uniformly lead the work of the blackboard newspaper."

　　中南军政委员会通知所属各单位
    限十月前在全区建立收音网
    【本报讯】自中央人民政府新闻总署发布了关于建立广播收音网的决定之后，中南区党政军领导机关十分重视这一工作。五月十三日中共中央中南局宣传部曾发出“关于建立广播收音站的通知”，六月二十六日中南军政委员会林彪主席又发布通知，限于十月以前在全中南区普遍建立广播收音站。规定各县收音站必须收抄中央台、中南台及各省台发布的政令、通告及重要新闻，通过各种方式迅速传播到群众中去。
    中南军政委员会在通知中阐明建立广播收音网之重要性及号召各省领导机关充分利用这一宣传教育工具。
    中央人民政府新闻总署于四月二十三日业已发布了关于全国建立广播收音网的决定，这是最近期间我中南区各地新闻工作中重要组织工作之一。我中南区人口为各大行政区冠，地区辽阔，交通不便，且多为新区，文盲众多，各省报纸投递发行均有困难，特别是各专署地方报纸大部停办之后，广大乡村经常读不到报，或收到太迟。致使大部分群众对目前形势、政府法令、政策无所了解，或者道听途说，传闻失真，反动地主及匪徒和特务分子，借此不时制造谣言，蛊惑群众，以致影响政令推行。下级工作干部亦因不能及时收到上级指示，工作中常处被动，或者不能及时改变工作方法，造成工作中各种不应有的损失。加以他们工作繁忙，文化程度较低，读报不易，长此以往，对国家和人民均属不利。根据以上种种情况，中南全区各地建立收音站工作，实刻不容缓。因此，各省领导机关，必须懂得充分利用广播电台来进行工作和普遍建立收音站的重要，必须懂得利用这一现代化的领导工具，迅速而认真地克服过去农村工作中所遗留下来的手工业作风。各级政府及有关部门必须切实执行建立收音站的工作，并积极组织收听中南台和各省台发布之政令及重要新闻，通过油印报、黑板报、屋顶广播等形式迅速传播到群众中去，以便提高行政效率，迅速推行政令，掌握群众运动，教育干部和群众。如此，则中南区及各省人民政府的每一重要政令、指示或国内外的重大事件，即会很快的传到全区各个角落中去，这将对工作的推动上，起着重大的作用。因此通知中规定在十月以前，中南各省市必须完成的下面几件工作：
    （一）应于七月十日以前完成各省所属各县市所有收音机确实调查。原则上一县要设置一架收音机（较大市镇亦可设立）；大中城市则以机关、团体、学校为单位设立。
    （二）完成收音机的购置和分发。此项收音机购置费，原则上一半由各省市广播事业费内开支，一半由各省市地方经费内负担。一九五○年各省市广播台一律停止修建，其由大行政区拨发之广播事业费，主要用于此项建设。
    （三）各县必须迅速指定专任或兼职收音员二名。并应于八月底以前完成收音员训练。
    （四）各县收音站工作，规定为收抄中央台、中南台、各该省台记录新闻，并至少将上述各台政令通告、新闻、评论、讲演，武汉及广州报刊摘要等广播时间内重要内容，摘要送县级领导机关，并通过油印报、黑板报、屋顶广播等形式向群众迅速传播。其他节目即可组织群众收听，逐日预告重要广播内容。
    最后，通知指出：“为了使收听之政令、新闻、迅速传播到群众中去，各县收音站必须作好以下两件工作：
    １、油印报的传送：组织一切力量，如县邮局，下乡工作干部、小学校学生等，迅速传达，不积不压争取时间，以便迅速将消息传送各区、村。
    ２、广泛组织黑板报：县民教馆应把这一工作当作最近几月来的一个中心任务，要求各行政村、市集均建立一块黑板报，黑板报的内容应包括：除本省的重要政令通告，全国内外重大新闻外，应经常报道本区、村工作情况与典型人物事迹的批评和表扬，群众意见，以及一般的政策法令，配合当地的中心工作的鼓动工作。这一工作的领导，应以区文教助理员为首组织一黑板报管委会，经常组织这一工作的执行，并广泛组织小学教员，参加这一工作。各地人民教育馆工作者，在当地收音站建立以后，必须尽可能多设黑板报，以利传布。黑板报文字必须一律采用楷书。在专署级地方报业已取消的地方（包括某些中小城市），黑板报便成为各级地方领导机关团结与教育群众的主要工具之一，必须重视，并派有能力的干事，统一领导黑板报工作。”
