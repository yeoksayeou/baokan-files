To the Editor:

　　Luoyang's Longmen Grottoes in Henan are a world-renowned scenic spot with historical and cultural value. Recently, I passed through the area and found that the local government is not paying enough attention to the protection of Longmen.

　　(1) Local people are blasting stones on the western cliffs in large quantities to make lime, leaving the magnificent cliffs incomplete. I believe that the beauty of Longmen lies not only in its stone Buddhas but also in the magnificent cliffs, lush cypress trees, and other elements that complement the stone Buddhas. Therefore, to maintain the beauty of Longmen, it is necessary to protect every element that constitutes its beautiful scenery. The destruction of its cliffs damages the overall appearance of Longmen.

　　(2) In many caves, people are burning fires, blackening the stone Buddhas and the carved patterns on the cave walls, making them difficult to recognize.

　　(3) Some caves are covered with human and bird droppings, which are very dirty.

　　Therefore, I hope that the local government will quickly stop the masses from blasting the cliffs and strictly protect other historical sites.

　　洛阳龙门文物古迹
    当地政府应加保护编辑同志：
    河南洛阳西之龙门，乃天下驰名的名胜古迹，富有历史与文化价值。最近，我路过该地，发现当地政府对龙门之保护很不注意。
    （一）当地老百姓，正大量爆炸西边石崖上的石头作石灰，把雄伟壮丽的石崖，炸得残缺不全。我认为：龙门之美丽壮观，不单在于其石佛，也在于壮丽石崖、苍翠的柏树群等对石佛之衬托。因此，要保持龙门之美好面貌，必须保护构成其美景的每个因素。而对其石崖之破坏，就整个损害了龙门之面貌。
    （二）不少石洞里，有人在烧火，把石佛及洞里石壁上雕刻的花纹等，熏得漆黑难认。
    （三）有些石洞里，人粪鸟粪遍地，十分肮脏。
    因此，希望该地政府尽速制止群众对石崖之爆破，并对其它古迹严加保护。
