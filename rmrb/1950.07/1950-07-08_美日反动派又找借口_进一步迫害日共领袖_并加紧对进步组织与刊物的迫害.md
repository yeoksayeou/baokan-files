Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The American and Japanese reactionaries are attempting to use the excuse of "suspicion of violating the purge order" to further persecute members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party who were illegally "purged" on June 6th. The Special Investigation Bureau of the Yoshida government's Ministry of Justice, citing an "intelligence report" that "purged" members of the JCP Central Committee and others held a secret meeting in northern Tokyo, began summoning more than ten JCP Central Committee members on the 3rd. Those summoned on the 3rd and 4th included Shiga Yoshio, Kurahara Korehito, and Kameyama Kozo, as well as Mrs. Tokuda Kyuichi. According to a United Press report on the 4th, quoting a Ministry of Justice spokesperson, "The interrogation did not reveal any conspiracy." The United Press also revealed, "If the government prosecutes them for violating the purge order and obtains confessions, they could face a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment and a fine of 75,000 yen."

At the same time, the American and Japanese reactionaries are also intensifying their persecution of progressive organizations and publications. On the 5th, Japanese police authorities raided 53 distribution points of the Akahata newspaper on a large scale and confiscated the newspaper published before it was illegally ordered to cease publication. The Special Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, on the pretext that the contents of the New Culture newspaper, edited by the Japan Democratic Culture League, "resist or oppose the occupying forces," and therefore violate the so-called "Group, etc. Regulation Order," filed charges against the newspaper. The Tokyo police authorities raided the league and the newspaper office on the 5th and unreasonably shut down the printing machines of the New Culture newspaper. The police also went to Musashino, north of Tokyo, to arrest Suzuki Munetoshi, the publisher of the New Culture newspaper.

　　美日反动派又找借口  进一步迫害日共领袖
    并加紧对进步组织与刊物的迫害
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：美、日反动派正企图以“违反整肃令嫌疑”为借口，进一步迫害于六月六日被非法“整肃”的日本共产党中央委员会委员。吉田政府法务府特别审查局借口获得一项“情报”说被“整肃”的日共中央委员等人曾在东京北部某地举行秘密会议，于三日开始传讯日共中央委员十余人。三、四两日被传讯的，除志贺义雄、藏原惟人和龟山幸三等中央委员外，还有德田球一夫人。据合众社四日电引法务府发言人谈话称：“讯问并没有得到任何阴谋”。合众社并透露：“如果政府以破坏整肃令进行审讯，并得到口供，他们最重将被判处徒刑十年和七万五千日元的罚金”。
    与此同时，美、日反动派也在加紧迫害进步组织与刊物。日本警察当局于五日大举突击搜查赤旗报的五十三家分销处，并没收在被非法勒令停刊前出版的该报。法务府特别审查局借口日本民主主义文化联盟所编辑的新文化报的内容“反抗或反对占领军”，因此有违犯所谓“团体等规正令”的嫌疑，对该报加以检举。东京警察当局竟于五日对该联盟及该报社进行突击搜查，并无理封闭新文化报的印刷机器等。警察并往东京以北的武藏野地方逮捕新文化报的发行人铃木宗。
