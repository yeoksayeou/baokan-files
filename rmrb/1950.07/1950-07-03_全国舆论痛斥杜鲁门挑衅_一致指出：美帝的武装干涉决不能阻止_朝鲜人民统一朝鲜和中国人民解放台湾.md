Xinhua News Agency, June 30th: All Chinese newspapers on the 29th published Chairman Mao's speech at the Central People's Government Committee and Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement refuting Truman's statement undermining Far Eastern peace in the most prominent positions on the front page. At the same time, they also reported the news of the Korean People's Army liberating Seoul in a prominent position. Many newspapers have also published commentaries on the U.S. armed invasion of Taiwan in the past two days.
    The Tianjin Tianjin Daily published a commentary on the 29th stating: The people of Tianjin resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. We will respond to the aggression of U.S. imperialism with actions to increase production and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. The commentary emphasized: The people understand the conspiracy of imperialism and are also aware of the fragility of imperialism. The intervention of U.S. imperialism will not change the fact that the People's Liberation Army will liberate Taiwan, nor will it prevent the Korean people from unifying Korea, nor will it prevent the people of Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries from overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs. Tianjin Progressive Daily wrote in today's editorial: The United States has a vast people at home who are against war, and no reliable allies abroad. The contradictions between Britain and the United States are deepening, and the pawns cultivated in West Germany and Japan have not yet been completed, and the aggression against Korea has suffered blows from the beginning. Truman's challenge statement is actually a manifestation of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak.
    Shanghai Dagongbao published an editorial saying: This arrogant act of aggression by U.S. imperialism is the most violent and shameful page in the history of international relations! The Korean people's own affairs should be left to the Korean people to solve themselves. Taiwan is Chinese territory and within Chinese sovereignty. Liberating Taiwan is our business. The Chinese people and the Korean people will never be intimidated by Truman's arrogant statements and unreasonable actions. We are familiar with the fact that U.S. imperialism today is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Our territory will never be invaded, and we will definitely safeguard peace in the Far East.
    The Chongqing Xinmin Daily's editorial stated: Taiwan is Chinese territory and no one is allowed to invade it. The United States must bear full responsibility for any consequences arising from U.S. armed intervention. In today's increasingly strong peace camp, whoever dares to play with fire will perish.
    The Changsha New Hunan Daily's editorial pointed out: The forces defending world peace will never hesitate because of the warmongers' intimidation and acts of aggression. MacArthur's air and sea forces cannot stop the victory of the Korean people, and the so-called "Seventh Fleet" cannot stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan.

　　全国舆论痛斥杜鲁门挑衅
    一致指出：美帝的武装干涉决不能阻止
    朝鲜人民统一朝鲜和中国人民解放台湾
    【本报讯】据新华社三十日讯：全中国的报纸二十九日均以首版最显著地位，刊登毛主席在中央人民政府委员会上的讲话和周外长驳斥杜鲁门破坏远东和平声明的严正声明，同时并以显著地位报道朝鲜人民军解放汉城的消息。许多报纸并就美国武装侵略台湾一事先后于昨今两日发表评论。
    天津天津日报二十九日发表的评论称：天津人民坚决拥护周外长的声明，我们决以努力增加生产、支援人民解放军解放台湾的行动来回答美帝国主义的侵略。评论力称：人民懂得帝国主义的阴谋，也洞悉帝国主义的脆弱。美帝国主义的干涉，丝毫不能改变人民解放军解放台湾的事实，同样，决不能阻止朝鲜人民统一朝鲜，也决不能阻止越、菲等国人民打倒帝国主义及其走狗们的反动统治。天津进步日报今日的社论写道：美国内有反战的广大人民，外无可靠的与国。英美之间的矛盾正在加深，在西德和日本培养的爪牙未成，对朝鲜的侵略开始即受打击。杜鲁门的挑战声明实是色厉内荏的表现。
    上海大公报发表社评说：美帝国主义的这种狂妄侵略行为，在国际关系的历史上，是最暴戾最可耻的一页！朝鲜人民自己的事，应让朝鲜人民自己解决。台湾是中国的领土，在中国主权之内，解放台湾是我们的事。中国人民、朝鲜人民，绝不会被杜鲁门的狂妄声明与无理行动所吓倒，我们熟稔今天美帝国主义是外强中干的，我们的领土绝不受侵略，我们必将维护远东和平。
    重庆新民报的社论称：台湾是中国的领土，是不容许任何人侵犯的。美国武装干涉所引起的任何后果，都得由美国负完全责任。在和平阵营日益壮大的今天，谁敢玩火，谁就要灭亡。
    长沙新湖南报的社论指出：保卫世界和平的力量决不会因战争贩子的恫吓和侵略行动而踌躇不前，麦克阿瑟的海空军阻止不了朝鲜人民的胜利，所谓“第七舰队”也阻止不了中国人民的解放台湾。
