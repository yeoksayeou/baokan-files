(Reported by this newspaper) According to the *Sunan Daily* and Xinhua News Agency: Summer planting in Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui has been basically completed. Summer weeding and flood prevention are now underway to ensure the autumn harvest.

Since the widespread heavy rains in the middle of June in the three regions of Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, the severe drought conditions have been eliminated. The people's governments in each region promptly led the masses of farmers to shift to shock planting, replanting, and crop changing. They also provided large quantities of seeds and Renminbi loans to solve the seed shortage problems for households in difficulty during the summer planting season. The Yixing County government in Southern Jiangsu lent out more than 1,538,000 catties of rice, and the Jiangning County government lent out 100 million Renminbi. Xin'an and Shuyang counties in Northern Jiangsu lent out 1,680,000 catties of seeds. The Northern Anhui Administrative Region allocated more than 10 million catties of soybean seeds and lent out 1 billion Renminbi. Thanks to the leadership of governments at all levels and material assistance, the summer planting work in various regions was successfully completed one after another.

The rice transplanting area in Southern Jiangsu reached more than 15.5 million mu, accounting for more than 90% of the total paddy field area. In Funing County, Northern Jiangsu, 410,000 mu of the 460,000 mu of summer planting land has been planted, and the over one million mu of land with missing seedlings in Sheyang has also been completely replanted. In Northern Anhui, the area of rice transplanting and autumn crop sowing reached more than 40 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the total cultivated area. Among them, the summer planting area in Chuxian and Chaohu regions combined exceeded last year by more than 100,000 mu.

After the farmers in various regions generally received soaking rains from mid-June to early July, they launched intense summer weeding. In Northern Jiangsu, the general spring fields have been weeded two to three times, and most of the paddy fields have been weeded once or twice. In Northern Anhui, the general spring fields and seedling fields have been weeded two to three times, and some areas have been weeded five to six times, an average of one more weeding than last year. Southern Jiangsu suffered the most severe drought before the rains in mid-June. After a long drought, the farmers in the area were in high spirits after finally getting ample rain and actively processed and applied fertilizer. Fertilizer application exceeded last year, and processing generally reached two harrowings and two weedings, and some reached three harrowings and three weedings. Now the crops are generally growing strongly. According to the masses, this year's production may increase by 10% to 20%.

Now that the flood season has arrived, all localities are intensively mobilizing farmers to drain water and prevent floods, and are strengthening inspections to ensure the autumn harvest. In some areas of Fuyang and Liu'an regions in Northern Anhui, some areas have been flooded due to the breach of the Huai River. Rescuing victims and draining water to save seedlings is now underway. In Northern Jiangsu, some low-lying areas have also suffered from waterlogging due to excessive rainfall, and drainage and flood prevention are being strengthened.

　　苏南、苏北、皖北等区
    夏种工作基本完成         
    现正进行夏锄和排水防汛
    【本报讯】据苏南日报和新华社消息：苏南、苏北、皖北等三区的夏种工作已基本完成。现正进行夏锄和排水防汛，以确保秋收。
    苏南等三区自六月中旬普遍落透雨后，严重的旱象已告消除，各区人民政府乃及时领导农民群众转入突击抢种、补种、改种等工作。并贷出大批种籽、人民币、解决了夏种中的困难户的缺种问题。苏南宜兴县府贷出米一百五十三万八千余斤，江宁县府贷出人民币一亿。苏北的新安、沭阳两县贷出种籽一百六十八万斤。皖北行政区拨出豆种千余万斤，贷出人民币十亿元。由于各级人民政府的领导与物质上的帮助，各区夏种工作先后得以顺利完成。
    苏南全区插秧面积达一千五百余万亩，占全部稻田面积百分之九十以上。苏北阜宁县四十六万亩夏种地，已抢种四十一万亩，射阳百余万亩缺苗田，也全部补种完毕。皖北区插秧和播种秋季作物面积共达四千多万亩，占总耕面积百分之八十以上，其中滁县、巢湖两专区夏种面积合计超过去年十万多亩。
    各区农民从六月中旬至七月初先后普遍得到透雨后，展开了紧张的夏锄工作。苏北一般春田，已普遍锄过二遍至三遍，稻田大部已薅草一遍至二遍。皖北一般春田秧田普遍锄过二遍至三遍，部分地区锄过五遍至六遍，平均比去年多锄一遍。苏南在六月中旬未落雨前，受旱最严重。该区农民在久旱之后忽得甘雨，生产情绪很高，一般都积极加工施肥。施肥工作都超过去年，加工一般做到二荡二耘，部分做到三荡三耘。现在庄稼普遍长得壮旺，据群众反映，今年可能增产一、二成。
    现在汛期已到，各地正紧张地动员农民排水防汛，并加强检查，以确保秋收。皖北阜阳、六安专区某些地区，因淮河决口被淹，现正抢救灾民和排水救苗。苏北部分洼地亦因雨量过多积水成灾，亦正加强排水防汛。
