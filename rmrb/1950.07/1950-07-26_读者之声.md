　　Voices of the Readers
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers pointing out several problems in publishing work, covering a wide range. Some of these still need to be processed after consulting the actual materials. This issue is slightly organized and publishes a portion, hoping that editors, authors, and publishers will listen to the opinions of the masses.
    We express our sincere gratitude to the readers who submitted letters; and ask the wider readership to contact us more often.

    One. Regarding the publication and reprinting of classic and documentary works
    Mr. Huang Xiangsen pointed out the following in his letter: "Recently, a work by Engels, *New Philosophical Paradigm*, published by Shanghai Wenyuan Publishing House and translated by Liang Wu, has appeared on the market. In fact, this is the first part of Engels' *Anti-Dühring*. As far as I know, Wu Liping translated *Anti-Dühring* twenty years ago and revised it once ten years ago. Wu's initial translation had many serious errors (referring only to the first part, *Philosophy*), but the revised edition has made great corrections. When I first saw Liang's translation, I thought it was a new translation, but later I discovered that Liang's translation was Wu's translation (only occasionally changing a few words), and it was Wu's initial translation. The difference is that Liang's translation is worse than Wu's initial translation: First, Liang's translation preserves all the errors of Wu's initial translation; second, Liang's translation has many arbitrary deletions. It is inappropriate to treat Marxist-Leninist classics and readers in this way. In addition, Wenyuan Publishing House also published the second and third parts of *Anti-Dühring* under the titles *New Economic Paradigm* and *Socialism* respectively. I have not compared these two books with the original text and Wu's translation, please Wenyuan Publishing House check it yourself."
    Regarding the above matter, we hope that Wenyuan Publishing House will conduct a thorough review.
    In addition, Mr. Xia Yuanqing sent a letter, along with a copy of *The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party* printed by the "New Culture Compilation Society," pointing out many proofreading errors in the book, which harmed readers. This "New Culture Compilation Society" may just be a name used to do reprint business. However, such behavior of ruining documentary works and harming readers should be condemned.

    Two. Regarding publishing the same book multiple times
    Mr. Ruan Chuzhen pointed out another problem, saying: "Some writers publish their works casually due to convenient printing conditions (or other reasons), even publishing the same content of works with different titles in two bookstores successively or simultaneously. This not only wastes manpower and material resources, but also easily deceives readers, which is inappropriate." The examples she cited are: Dazhong Bookstore published Wang Yaping's *Chinese Ballad Poetry* in February of this year, and Qunyi Publishing House published his *Chunyun's Divorce* in April of this year. Both books include the same seven articles, "and five of them are the same, the only differences being two articles, and a preface and postscript added by the author in *Chunyun's Divorce*."
    Mr. Yu Lan pointed out another example of the same nature. Shanghai Publishing Company published Zeng Ke's *A Thousand Miles Advance* in December 1949, and East China Xinhua Bookstore published the author's *Marching into the Dabie Mountains* in April 1950. The content is exactly the same, only the latter has an additional preface written by Mao Dun, *Reading 'Marching into the Dabie Mountains'*. Tianxia Book Company also published Zeng Ke's *The Iron Tree Blossoms* in February of this year, "which includes six works by the author, four of which are repeated from the above two collections."
    The situation they pointed out about publishing the same book multiple times is a fact, and this is obviously not something that readers will welcome.

    Three. Regarding improving and strengthening distribution work
    Mr. Yang Mingti put forward his opinions on improving and strengthening distribution work:
    "The people's publishing and distribution事业 (shìyè, undertaking/cause/enterprise) has played a powerful role in the nationwide political learning movement in the past year, and has also done some work in improving the quality and seriousness of publications, but the distribution work still has many shortcomings, mainly because the work of organizing the distribution of books has not penetrated deeply into the reader masses, actively connected, and given them the greatest convenience in selecting and purchasing books, thereby doubling the dissemination of books and newspapers beneficial to the people. I suggest:
    1. Strengthen the work of reporting on new book publications and content introductions. If this work is not done in a timely manner, it will weaken the guiding role for readers and indirectly affect distribution work.
    2. Bookstores should pay attention to establishing connections with factories, rural areas, schools, and various mass organizations in order to better understand the needs of the masses, and at the same time can entrust them to act as agents for the sale of books. In the past, Xinhua and Sanlian bookstores transported books by car to sell to military factories, which gave readers great convenience. Unfortunately, that was only a sudden two or three times. Wouldn't it be better if we could entrust the mass organizations in these areas to do it? We must also pay attention to having more types of books, so that readers can choose. In the past, the books transported for sale were often only a few documentary books, and there were very few novels and magazines. Secondly, a "book purchase loan system" can be established to facilitate readers who are eager to buy books but cannot pay temporarily. The book money can be guaranteed to be repaid regularly by mass organizations.
    3. I hope that comrades in publishing work will actively think of ways to expand the circulation of beneficial books, which is beneficial to improving the people's ideological and cultural life. We should overcome the conservative thinking that exists in some comrades, and not be satisfied with the current circulation of books and the phenomenon of crowded people in bookstores. Even those reactionary and shameless publishers in the United States pay attention to setting up bookstores in street pharmacies and grocery stores, let alone us!"
    Mr. Yang Mingti's opinions are very worthy of attention. Generally speaking, the work of introducing, distributing, and promoting books is not done well enough, which has been mentioned in the eighth issue of this journal. This journal should also bear some responsibility for the first point, and hopes that writers, publishers, and readers will cooperate with us. For the second and third points, the "fortune telling stall" mentality in distribution work, the decorative blitz work, and the "icing on the cake" type of bias limited to a few areas should be corrected, because they cannot meet the regular needs of the vast number of readers.

    Four. Further criticism of books like "Entrance Examination Guidance"
    The previous issue of this journal has already published some readers' opinions on books such as "Entrance Examination Guidance," and pointed out the hope that teachers will use this to conduct education and eradicate this bad phenomenon. Mr. Song Lan wrote again, saying: "I think there is still something insufficient, because this is a very serious and very common phenomenon. Some speculative publishers, they are already "intoxicated" in this "事业" (shìyè, undertaking/cause/enterprise), which is both labor-saving and profitable. Just saying this slightly will not have much educational effect on them. And some teachers do not pay enough attention to this issue."
    He went on to cite facts to illustrate his views: "My younger brother graduated from Fresh Hutong Elementary School this year. Their teacher introduced them to a *Junior High School Entrance Examination Tool* published by Gulou Publishing House as a reference book, and also supplied it in large quantities in the school cooperative. One day he asked me: 'What does Lin Zuhan do?' I said: 'He is the Secretary-General of our Central People's Government.' He said: 'Isn't that Lin Boqu?' I said: 'That's right, Lin Zuhan is Lin Boqu.' He said: 'They are not the same person.' He immediately found the basis for me. He opened page seventeen of *Junior High School Entrance Examination Tool* and it really wrote '6. Name five leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Lin Boqu, Lin Zuhan)'. This is really a joke, the editor actually treated one person as two people. I continued to read, question eight writes that the master of history is the (proletarian) class, question ten, in order to explain who led the Northern Expedition, the editor quoted extensively, and then came to a conclusion, 'Therefore, the Northern Expedition can be said to be led by three classes (the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie)'. I suggest to you, should remind everyone to pay more attention, completely eliminate this bad phenomenon. I earnestly hope that you can pay attention to this work."
    In addition, we have also received letters from Mr. Wang Yongming from Ci County and Mr. Liang Zhenglun from Lin County, Pingyuan Province, respectively pointing out several errors in the *Liberation Version Practical Junior High School Entrance Examination Guidance* published by Beijing Yichang Bookstore, and the *Liberation Junior High School Entrance Examination Guidance* published by Beijing Jianye Bookstore. The usual situation of this type of books is: most of the questions are old, the content is old, a small part of the questions are newly added, pieced together, and the name indicates what "Liberation Version" and so on, which is just to deceive readers.
    Incidentally, it is explained here: On the 20th of this month, Guangming Daily's "Chaoyang" had an article "Review of Three *Junior High School Entrance Examination Guidance*", one of which was Jianye Bookstore's Liberation *Junior High School Entrance Examination Guidance*, and the other two were Guanghua Bookstore's *Latest Junior High School Entrance Examination Guidance* and the *Junior High School Entrance Examination Guidance* published by Wanguo Bookstore reflected in the previous issue of this journal. Readers can refer to it, and this journal will not make a separate review.

### 读者之声

专栏：

　　读者之声
    近来我们收到很多读者来信，指出了若干出版工作中的问题，涉及的范围是很广的。其中有些还需要参考实际材料后再行处理。本期略加组织，发表了一部分，希望编者、著者和出版者倾听一下群众的意见。
    我们向投函的读者们致真诚的谢意；并向更广大的读者们要求和我们多多联系。
    一  关于经典性、文件性著作的出版、翻印
    黄相森先生来信指出下面一件事：“近来市上出现一种恩格斯的著作《新哲学典范》，系上海文源出版社出版，梁武译。事实上，这就是恩格斯著《反杜林论》的第一部分。就我所知，《反杜林论》，吴理屏同志在二十年前曾有过一个译本，十年前修改过一次。吴的初译有许多严重的错误（此处仅指第一编《哲学》），但修订本已有了很大的改正。最初看见梁译本时，我还以为是一种新译本，后来才发现梁译就是吴译（只间或更动几个字），而且是吴的初译。所不同的是梁译比吴的初译更坏：第一，梁译保存了全部吴的初译的错误；第二，梁译更有许多任意的删节。用这样的态度来对待马列主义经典著作与读者，是不应该的。此外，文源出版社还以《新经济学典范》与《社会主义》的书名分别出版了《反杜林论》的第二、第三编。我不曾把这两本书与原文及吴译对照过，请文源出版社自己检查一下。”
    关于上面一件事希望文源出版社作一切实检讨。
    另外夏元卿先生寄来一封信，并附了“新文化编译社”印行的一本《中国革命与中国共产党》，指出书中很多的校勘错误，使读者受害。这一“新文化编译社”可能只是一个名义，用来做翻印生意的。但糟塌了文件性著作，害了读者，这种行为是应该予以指斥的。
    二  关于一书数印
    阮楚珍先生指出了另一个问题，说：“有些作家因为印刷条件方便（或者其它原因），把自己的作品随便出版，甚至把同一内容的作品，改头换面地在两家书店先后或同时出版、同时发售。这样不但浪费人力物力，而且使读者很容易上当，是不应该的。”她举出的例子是：大众书店在本年二月出版了王亚平的《中国说唱诗》，本年四月群益出版社又出版了他的《春云离婚》，两本书同样地收进了七篇文字，“而有五篇是相同的，不同的只有两篇，和《春云离婚》中作者所加进去的一篇序文和后记。”
    于蓝先生指出了另一同性质的例子。上海出版公司在一九四九年十二月出版了曾克的《千里跃进》，一九五○年四月华东新华书店又出版了作者的《挺进大别山》，内容完全一样，只是后者多了一篇茅盾所写的《读“挺进大别山》。天下图书公司在今年二月也出版了曾克的《铁树开了花》，“里面收了作者的六篇作品，其中有四篇又是与上述两个集子重复的。”
    他们所指出的这种一书数印的情形都是事实，这显然是不能得到读者欢迎的事。
    三  关于改进与加强发行工作
    杨明倜先生提出了他对于改进、加强发行工作的意见：
    “人民的出版与发行事业在一年来全国人民的政治学习运动展开中起了有力的配合作用，在提高出版物的质量和严肃性上也已作了一些工作，但发行工作还有着较多的缺点，主要是组织书籍发行的工作未曾深入读者群众，主动连系，给予他们以选择与购买书籍的最大的便利，从而加倍地扩大有益人民书报的传布数量。我建议：
    一、加强报道新书出版情况及内容介绍的工作。这些工作，不及时做好，就会削弱对读者的指导作用，间接也影响了发行工作。
    二、书店应注意和工厂、农村、学校各群众团体取得连系，借以更好地了解群众的要求，同时可以委托他们代理销售书籍的工作。过去新华、三联书店乘车运书到军队工厂出售，给读者很大的便利，可惜那还只是突击性的二三次，如果能委托这些地区的群众组织去做岂不更好。还须注意书籍的种类要多，便于读者选择。过去运去出售的往往只是少数文件性书籍，小说杂志等很少。其次，可建立“购书贷款制”，以便利急于购书而暂时付不出款的读者，书款可以由群众团体保证定期偿付。
    三、希望出版工作同志积极想办法扩大有益书籍的发行数量，这对提高人民的思想文化生活是有利的。应该克服存在于部分同志中的保守思想，不要满足于现有书籍的发行数量和书店中拥挤着人群的现象。美国那些反动无耻的出版商尚且注意在街头药房和杂货铺中遍设卖书处，何况我们！”
    杨明倜先生这些意见是很值得注意的。一般地讲，书籍的介绍、发行和推广工作做得都是不够的，这在本刊第八号上已经提到了。对于第一点，本刊也应担负一些责任的，希望作家、出版者和读者和我们合作。对于第二点和第三点，在发行工作上的“摆测字摊”思想，和点缀性的突击工作，以及“锦上添花”式的局限在少数地区的偏向，都是应该改正的，因为那都是不能满足广大读者的经常性的要求的。
    四  关于“升学指导”一类书的再批评
    本刊上期已经发表了一部分读者对“升学指导”一类书籍的意见，并指出希望教师们借以进行教育，根除这一不良现象。宋岚先生又来信说：“我觉得作的还有些不够，因为这是一个很严重而且很普遍的现象。有些投机的出版商，他们已经“沉醉”于这种“事业”，既省力，又多赚钱，只这样略略一说，对他们是不会发生什么多大教育作用的。而有的教师对这个问题也不够重视。”
    他接着举出事实来说明他的意见：“我的弟弟是今年在新鲜胡同小学毕业的，他们的先生便给他们介绍了一本鼓楼出版社的《高小升学工具》作参考书，并且还在校内合作社大批供应。有一天他问我：‘林祖涵是干什么的？’我说：‘是我们中央人民政府的秘书长。’他说：‘那不是林伯渠吗？’我说：‘对了，林祖涵就是林伯渠。’他说：‘他俩不是一个人。’他马上就给我找到了根据，他翻开《高小升学工具》的第十七页上边果真写着‘６，说出五个中国共产党的领袖（毛泽东、周恩来、刘少奇、林伯渠、林祖涵）’。这真是笑话，编辑先生竟把一个人当作两个人了。我接着看下去，第八题写着历史的主人是（无产）阶级，第十题编者为了说明北伐是什么人领导的，还引经据典了一番，之后下了一个结论，‘因此北伐战争可以说是三个阶级（无产阶级、小资产阶级、资产阶级）领导的’。我向您们提议，应该多多提醒大家的注意，彻底消灭这种不良现象。我恳切的希望你们能够重视这件工作。”
    此外，我们还接到磁县王永鸣和平原省林县梁正伦两位先生来信，分别指出北京益昌书局出版的《解放版实用高小升学指导》，和北京建业书店出版的《解放高小升学指导》当中的若干错误。这一类书籍的通常情形是：大部分问题是旧的，内容是旧的，一小部分问题是新加的，是零零碎碎掇拾来的，而在书名上标明什么“解放版”云云，那只是借以欺骗读者罢了。
    附带在这儿说明：本月二十日光明日报“朝阳”曾有一篇“评三本《高小升学指导》”，其中有一本就是建业书店的解放《高小升学指导》，另二本是光华书局的《最新高小升学指导》和本刊上期所反映的万国书店出版的《高小升学指导》，读者可以参阅，本刊不另致评。
