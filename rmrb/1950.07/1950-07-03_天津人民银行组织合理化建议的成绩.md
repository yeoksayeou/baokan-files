The Achievements of the Tianjin People's Bank in Organizing Rationalization Proposals
	Wang Jingran

	(1) Over 180 Rationalization Proposals in Five Months
	The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has achieved remarkable results in organizing rationalization proposals. From January to the end of May this year, active employees from more than 20 units under the bank submitted a total of over 180 rationalization proposals.

	The preparation for rationalization proposals began in January. At that time, administrative leaders and the workers' union first mobilized all employees, calling on them to exercise their sense of ownership, employ a democratic style, and, based on their own observations, analysis, and judgment, come up with useful ideas. The aim was to deepen business operations and accomplish the major tasks assigned by the head office through the principle of collective wisdom. After February, the effort was fully and enthusiastically launched. Each unit formed a rationalization proposal committee and dedicated considerable space in its publications to publicize proposals, publishing both correct and less comprehensive ones, which were then discussed and handled separately.

	The proposers were extremely broad-based, accounting for approximately one-sixteenth of all personnel, meaning that on average, one person out of every sixteen submitted a proposal. The nature of the proposals covered almost all aspects of the bank's business, with the most in the area of deposits, totaling 58. Domestic and foreign exchange, cashier, accounting, and documentation each had between 10 and 20 proposals. Loans, financial management, statistics, cash management, treasury, savings and trust, personnel, and organization each had less than 10 proposals.

	(2) Characteristics and Role of Rationalization Proposals
	Closely integrated with central work
	The first characteristic and role of rationalization proposals is that they are integrated with central work, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to jointly strive to complete the major tasks at hand. For example, after the First National Financial Conference, the work of absorbing deposits was listed as the top priority. In April and May, proposals in this area accounted for 44. After the State Council and the head office jointly issued an order on cash management on May 8, eight proposals were submitted in less than a month. The proposals focused on technical aspects, specific practices, procedural improvements, suggestions for new businesses, opposition to bureaucratic work styles, and provision of leadership decision-making. For example, some said, "To widely solicit opinions from public enterprises and institutions on the bank, a symposium of accounting personnel from various institutions could be held to improve procedures according to needs." Some said, "During non-office hours, duty personnel should be appropriately retained to handle urgent matters." Some advocated expanding the scope of collection, some advocated running special (employee) deposit business, and so on. One comrade, after seeing an error in a unit failing to send a telegraphic transfer, proposed that each unit launch an "anti-error, anti-delay" movement. Another comrade, in his rationalization proposal, after listing many facts of bureaucracy, analyzed that these problems were problems in principle, hindering our work. If not overcome, because of the result of "palms facing people" the social idle funds that could be absorbed would inevitably be pushed out. Therefore, he proposed that the business leadership should regularly collect materials on bureaucratic work styles, immediately present them, and use study groups as units, once a week, to conduct self-criticism to find the root causes and study specific measures to improve. If the system is unsound, study and improve the system; if there are not enough people, equip people, so that existing problems can be solved in a timely and reasonable manner.

	Helping the promotion of new work
	With the development of the objective situation, the Tianjin Branch, like many other inter-banks, has been constantly adding many new businesses and new jobs. Even if some people had done it in the past, it was either a rural set or a pre-liberation four major family bank set. The financial work of a state-owned bank in a big city in a truly new democratic society is not proficient or even unfamiliar to the vast majority of people. However, because rationalization proposals were launched, many methods have been thought of. According to statistics, among more than 180 proposals, those related to new methods and new approaches accounted for 33. For example, one comrade, in proposing that cash management should be gradually divided and implemented, said: "In the future, it must be divided. We believe that the steps can be started by various specialized banks and departments acting as agents for cash management. Each office will start with collection and payment, and gradually, the offices can also act as agents for cash management by region. Obviously, relying on the current cash management department alone is not enough.” One comrade believes that in implementing cash management, it is necessary to discover talents in a timely manner. He said: "This work is not only unfamiliar, but also extremely difficult. In addition to strengthening learning, it is also necessary to absorb cost accounting talents and specific technical talents (such as chemical, textile, and mechanical). It is recommended to hold talent registration to give full play to the original technology to meet the urgent needs." In addition, there are suggestions to establish "collection, payment, and allocation" between units, or to promote special checks and strengthen connections between departments, improve account books, lists and other technical issues, and so on.

	Providing opinions on improving work
	The content of rationalization proposals is not limited to work methods, procedural improvements, and technical issues. It also contributes many useful opinions on policies, principles, and systems. According to statistics, among all proposals from January to May, those in this area accounted for 19. Someone saw that the foreign exchange exchange had not played a major role for a long time, and proposed to abolish the foreign exchange exchange (already done). Someone saw that private banks and villages spent a lot of effort to absorb employee deposits and were effective, so they suggested running special real-value deposits (already done). There are also suggestions to establish sub-treasuries in the urban area (under study), or to organize foreign exchange syndicates. Some proposed to timely reduce interest rates in the context of stable prices, some proposed to take "water conservancy" as the agricultural loan center to adapt to the agricultural production conditions in the Tianjin suburbs, some proposed that the loan period should be determined by the speed of production turnover, some explained valuable opinions in striving for overseas remittances and rewarding overseas Chinese investment in returning to the country, and some analyzed the reasons for controlling the foreign price of export materials. When there were defects in the interest calculation method of flexible fixed deposits, someone immediately sounded the alarm, saying that there were "two loopholes", which immediately aroused vigilance. The above suggestions have played a great role in improving work.

	(3) Several Experiences and Lessons in Carrying out Rationalization Proposals
	1. The issue of implementing the democratic work style of leading cadres: After receiving large cities, the work in the past year was basically the nature of setting up stalls and building shelves. The real detailed and in-depth organizational work has generally started this year. On the one hand, to go deeper, there are more problems. On the other hand, the objective situation is constantly increasing our burdens. How to further implement the democratic work style from top to bottom, inspire comrades' sense of ownership, and everyone think of ways to overcome the difficulties in the work and solve the various new problems encountered has become an urgent matter. Therefore, the leading cadres of the bank have always been grasping the organization of rationalization proposals relatively tightly in recent months.

	2. Having rational suggestions requires timely processing: Even if leading cadres promote a democratic work style and everyone actively puts forward suggestions, if a indifferent attitude is adopted towards suggestions and they are not specifically handled, the active ideological buds will still be quickly suppressed. Therefore, launching and organizing rationalization proposals is important, but timely processing of these proposals is even more important. For example, the bank published statistics on June 8 on the handling of 17 deposit-related proposals in May: Instructed the subordinate to follow four pieces, announced for each unit to consider and adopt separately five pieces, announced as educational cadre materials two pieces, official letter to other agencies to jointly handle one piece, partially adopted one piece, already similar methods implemented and not adopted one piece, under consideration two pieces, and inconvenient to adopt due to changes in the situation one piece.

	3. It is also very important to promote the style of "say everything you know, say everything you can" and give everyone the opportunity to speak. Different opinions are allowed to be discussed. Without freedom of speech, good opinions cannot be obtained; but without free debate, no conclusions can be reached. Therefore, in organizing rationalization proposals, organizing discussions and launching criticism are also indispensable. For example, when a suggestion is not very appropriate, other comrades will follow up with "consultation", "research", "further research" or "suggestion of suggestion", etc., so that the problem becomes more and more clear. If it is indeed not necessary to adopt, after the debate, at least the comrades who put forward the suggestion will have a deeper understanding. Taking the suggestions in May as an example, there were six different opinions proposed for discussion, some about institutions, some about cashier, some about domestic exchange, and some about deposits.

	4. Persist in implementing to the end: In the early stage, some comrades made suggestions and pointed out that a certain unit should pay attention to things. If they do not see any movement, they will be anxious due to a sense of responsibility. One comrade said in his "Suggestions for Handling Rationalization Proposals": "When readers see a suggestion published in the bulletin, they may think that it is just an article written casually, but it is not that simple. Every suggestion can be said to have gone through the process of observation, consideration, and research to be written out"; "Some are even written during vacation or by working overtime"; "If the suggestion is correct, the administration should adopt it or respond to it in a timely manner." The leading cadres of the bank immediately expressed their attitude: "We are determined to accept the suggestions of the suggestors and take responsibility to urge them to be implemented." The leaders and the led, the superiors and the subordinates, carried out the "rationalization proposals" in this mutual supervision and mutual encouragement.

　　天津人民银行组织合理化建议的成绩
    王静然
   （一）五个月合理化建议达一百八十余件
    中国人民银行天津分行组织的合理化建议，已有显著成绩。自本年一月至五月底，该行所属二十余个单位中的积极分子所提之合理化建议共达一百八十余件。
    合理化建议的酝酿，开始在一月份。当时首先由行政领导干部及职工委员会作动员，号召全体从业人员发挥主人翁思想，运用民主作风，根据自己的观察、分析、判断，拿出有用的主张，在集思广益的原则下，达到将业务工作深入一步，完成总行给予的重大任务。二月以后，便全面热烈展开。各单位均组成合理化建议委员会，并在刊物上辟出相当篇幅，予以刊载，不论正确的、欠周密的均予发表，经大家讨论后分别处理。
    提供建议的人员是极其广泛的，总计占全部人员约为十六分之一，即每平均十六个人即有一人提出建议。建议内容的性质，几乎遍及银行各种业务，其中以存款方面为最多，占五十八件；内汇、外汇、出纳、会计、文书等项各有十件至二十件；放款、金融管理、统计、现金管理、金库、储蓄信托、人事、机构等项各不足十件。
   （二）合理化建议的特点与作用
    紧密结合中心工作
    合理化建议的第一个特点与作用便是结合了中心工作，集中群众智慧，为完成当前重大的任务而共同努力。例如第一次全国金融会议后，将吸收存款工作列为头等重要任务，四、五月份所提此项建议即占四十四件，五月八日政务院及总行联署命令实行现金管理后，不到一月过程，所提建议亦有八件。建议的着眼点，有技术上的，有具体作法上的，有手续改进上的，亦有提议举办新业务的，有属于反对官僚主义作风的，也有提供领导决策的。例如有的说：“为广泛听取各公营企业机关单位对银行的意见，可召开各机关会计人员座谈会，以便根据需要改善手续”，有的说：“在非办公时间应酌留值班人员处理紧急事务”。有主张扩大代收范围的，有主张举办特种（职工）存款业务的等等，不一而足。有一同志看到一个单位漏发电报汇款的错误后，提议各单位应展开“反错误反迟缓”运动。又有一位同志提出的合理化建议，在列举了许多官僚主义的事实之后分析说：这些毛病是原则上的毛病，阻碍着我们的工作，如不克服，因为“手掌立而向人”的结果，势必把可能吸收到的社会闲散资金硬推出去，因此，他提议：业务领导方面应经常搜集官僚主义作风材料，即时提出，以学习小组为单位，每周来一次检讨，进行批评追根求源找出病根，研究具体办法，加以改进。如制度不善，即研究改善制度，如实因人手不够就配备人手，务使存在问题及时得到合理解决。
    帮助新工作的推行
    随着客观形势的发展，天津分行也和其他许多联行一样，是不断地增添了许多新业务新工作的，有些人过去即使作过，不是农村一套，便是解放前四大家族银行一套，真正新民主主义社会中，大城市国家银行的金融工作，在绝大多数人员中说都是不够熟练甚至是陌生的。但因为发动了合理化建议的关系，许多的办法都想出来了。据统计，一百八十余件建议中，属于新办法、新方式方面者，即占三十三件。例如一位同志在提出现金管理应逐步分工执行的建议中说：“将来一定得要分工的，其步骤我们认为可以先由各专业行、部代理现管工作，各办事处由代收代付作起，慢慢地，办事处也能按区代理执行现管工作，如只靠现在一个现金管理部显然是不行的，一位同志认为执行现金管理，需要及时发现人才，他说：“这一工作，既感生疏，且极艰巨，除了加强学习外，更需要吸收成本会计人才和具体技术人才（如化学、纺织、机械），建议举行人才登记，把原有技术充分发挥出来，以应急需。”此外尚有建议各单位之间建立“代收、代付、代拨”，或提倡专用支票及加强部门之间联系，改进账簿、清单和其他技术问题等等。
    提供改进工作的意见
    合理化建议的内容还不仅限于工作方法，手续改进以及技术方面的问题，即在政策原则、制度上，也贡献了不少有用的意见。据统计，一至五月全部建议中，属于这方面者即有十九件。有人看到外汇交易所长期无大作用时，即提出取消外汇交易所（已办）。有人看到私营行庄花费大力吸收职工存款且具效果时，便建议举办特种折实存款（已办）。还有主张在市区内普遍设立支金库（正在研究），或主张组织外汇银团。有提出在物价稳落情况下及时降低利息的，有提出为适应津郊农业生产条件将“水利”作为农贷中心的，有提出贷款期限应以生产性质周转快慢来决定的，有在争取侨汇与奖励侨资回国方面阐释宝贵意见的，也有在控制出口物资国外价格上分析理由的。在办活定两便存款计息办法有缺陷时，也立时有人敲响警钟，说存在“两个漏洞”，便立即引起了警惕。以上这些建议，对改进工作都起了极大作用。
  （三）合理化建议工作开展中的几点体会与经验
    一、领导干部民主作风的贯彻问题：经过接收的大城市，去年一年的工作基本上还都是摆摊子搭架子性质的，真正细致深入一步的组织工作，大体是从今年才开始的。一方面是求深入，问题就多，另方面客观形势还在不断加重我们的担子。如何自上而下进一步贯彻民主作风，启发同志们主人翁思想，大家想办法来克服工作中的困难，并解决所遇到的各种新问题，就成了刻不容缓的事了。因此，该行领导干部数月来对组织合理化建议这一点始终是抓得较紧的。
    二、有了合理建议还须及时处理：即使领导干部发扬了民主作风，大家也积极提出了建议，但如对建议采取漠然置之的态度，而不加以具体处理，对积极的思想萌芽仍然是会很快打击下去的。因此，发动组织合理化建议固然重要，但及时处理这些建议更重要。如该行于六月八日发表统计对五月份有关存款建议十七件的处理情形是：指示所属照办者四件，公布让各单位考虑分别采纳者五件，公布作教育干部材料者两件，公函其他机关共同处理者一件，部分采纳者一件，已有类同办法实施未采纳者一件，正在考虑中者两件，因情况变化不便再采纳者一件。
    三、发扬“知无不言，言无不尽”的作风，给每个人有说话的机会，不同意见允许讨论，也是很重要的。没有自由发言，良好意见固然拿不出来；但没有自由辩驳也得不出结论。因此，在组织合理化建议中，组织讨论，展开批判也是不可少的。例如一个建议提得不十分得当的时候，别的同志便跟着会有“商榷”、“研究”、“再研究”或“建议之建议”等等，这样问题便愈来愈明确了。如确系没有采纳必要者，经过辩论后，至少使提出建议的同志，从而认识更深刻一步。仅以五月份的建议说，提出讨论的不同意见有六件，有关于机构方面的，有关于出纳的，有关于内汇的，也有关于存款的。
    四、坚持不懈贯彻到底：初期有些同志提了意见，指出某单位应注意事情后，如不见动静，由于责任心的驱使，他便着急了，有一位同志在他“对于处理合理化建议的建议”中说：“在通报上发表一篇建议，读者们看来，或者觉得这不过是顺手写了一篇文章，其实不这么简单，每一个建议，可以说都经过观察、考虑、钻研的过程，才能把它写出来”；“有的甚至是在休假期间或开夜车写出来的，”“如果建议是对的，行政上应该及时予以采纳或予以答复。”该行领导干部随即表示了态度：“决接受建议者的建议，负起责任勉力督促付诸实现。”领导者与被领导者，上级和下级就是在这种相互督促，相互勉励下将“合理化建议”开展起来的。
