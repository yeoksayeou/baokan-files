The Achievements of the Tianjin People's Bank in Organizing Rationalization Proposals
	Wang Jingran

	(1) Over 180 Rationalization Proposals in Five Months
	The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has achieved remarkable results in organizing rationalization proposals. From January to the end of May this year, active employees from more than 20 units under the bank submitted a total of over 180 rationalization proposals.

	The preparation for rationalization proposals began in January. At that time, administrative leaders and the workers' union first mobilized all employees, calling on them to exercise their sense of ownership, employ a democratic style, and, based on their own observations, analysis, and judgment, come up with useful ideas. The aim was to deepen business operations and accomplish the major tasks assigned by the head office through the principle of collective wisdom. After February, the effort was fully and enthusiastically launched. Each unit formed a rationalization proposal committee and dedicated considerable space in its publications to publicize proposals, publishing both correct and less comprehensive ones, which were then discussed and handled separately.

	The proposers were extremely broad-based, accounting for approximately one-sixteenth of all personnel, meaning that on average, one person out of every sixteen submitted a proposal. The nature of the proposals covered almost all aspects of the bank's business, with the most in the area of deposits, totaling 58. Domestic and foreign exchange, cashier, accounting, and documentation each had between 10 and 20 proposals. Loans, financial management, statistics, cash management, treasury, savings and trust, personnel, and organization each had less than 10 proposals.

	(2) Characteristics and Role of Rationalization Proposals
	Closely integrated with central work
	The first characteristic and role of rationalization proposals is that they are integrated with central work, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to jointly strive to complete the major tasks at hand. For example, after the First National Financial Conference, the work of absorbing deposits was listed as the top priority. In April and May, proposals in this area accounted for 44. After the State Council and the head office jointly issued an order on cash management on May 8, eight proposals were submitted in less than a month. The proposals focused on technical aspects, specific practices, procedural improvements, suggestions for new businesses, opposition to bureaucratic work styles, and provision of leadership decision-making. For example, some said, "To widely solicit opinions from public enterprises and institutions on the bank, a symposium of accounting personnel from various institutions could be held to improve procedures according to needs." Some said, "During non-office hours, duty personnel should be appropriately retained to handle urgent matters." Some advocated expanding the scope of collection, some advocated running special (employee) deposit business, and so on. One comrade, after seeing an error in a unit failing to send a telegraphic transfer, proposed that each unit launch an "anti-error, anti-delay" movement. Another comrade, in his rationalization proposal, after listing many facts of bureaucracy, analyzed that these problems were problems in principle, hindering our work. If not overcome, because of the result of "palms facing people" the social idle funds that could be absorbed would inevitably be pushed out. Therefore, he proposed that the business leadership should regularly collect materials on bureaucratic work styles, immediately present them, and use study groups as units, once a week, to conduct self-criticism to find the root causes and study specific measures to improve. If the system is unsound, study and improve the system; if there are not enough people, equip people, so that existing problems can be solved in a timely and reasonable manner.

	Helping the promotion of new work
	With the development of the objective situation, the Tianjin Branch, like many other inter-banks, has been constantly adding many new businesses and new jobs. Even if some people had done it in the past, it was either a rural set or a pre-liberation four major family bank set. The financial work of a state-owned bank in a big city in a truly new democratic society is not proficient or even unfamiliar to the vast majority of people. However, because rationalization proposals were launched, many methods have been thought of. According to statistics, among more than 180 proposals, those related to new methods and new approaches accounted for 33. For example, one comrade, in proposing that cash management should be gradually divided and implemented, said: "In the future, it must be divided. We believe that the steps can be started by various specialized banks and departments acting as agents for cash management. Each office will start with collection and payment, and gradually, the offices can also act as agents for cash management by region. Obviously, relying on the current cash management department alone is not enough.‚Äù One comrade believes that in implementing cash management, it is necessary to discover talents in a timely manner. He said: "This work is not only unfamiliar, but also extremely difficult. In addition to strengthening learning, it is also necessary to absorb cost accounting talents and specific technical talents (such as chemical, textile, and mechanical). It is recommended to hold talent registration to give full play to the original technology to meet the urgent needs." In addition, there are suggestions to establish "collection, payment, and allocation" between units, or to promote special checks and strengthen connections between departments, improve account books, lists and other technical issues, and so on.

	Providing opinions on improving work
	The content of rationalization proposals is not limited to work methods, procedural improvements, and technical issues. It also contributes many useful opinions on policies, principles, and systems. According to statistics, among all proposals from January to May, those in this area accounted for 19. Someone saw that the foreign exchange exchange had not played a major role for a long time, and proposed to abolish the foreign exchange exchange (already done). Someone saw that private banks and villages spent a lot of effort to absorb employee deposits and were effective, so they suggested running special real-value deposits (already done). There are also suggestions to establish sub-treasuries in the urban area (under study), or to organize foreign exchange syndicates. Some proposed to timely reduce interest rates in the context of stable prices, some proposed to take "water conservancy" as the agricultural loan center to adapt to the agricultural production conditions in the Tianjin suburbs, some proposed that the loan period should be determined by the speed of production turnover, some explained valuable opinions in striving for overseas remittances and rewarding overseas Chinese investment in returning to the country, and some analyzed the reasons for controlling the foreign price of export materials. When there were defects in the interest calculation method of flexible fixed deposits, someone immediately sounded the alarm, saying that there were "two loopholes", which immediately aroused vigilance. The above suggestions have played a great role in improving work.

	(3) Several Experiences and Lessons in Carrying out Rationalization Proposals
	1. The issue of implementing the democratic work style of leading cadres: After receiving large cities, the work in the past year was basically the nature of setting up stalls and building shelves. The real detailed and in-depth organizational work has generally started this year. On the one hand, to go deeper, there are more problems. On the other hand, the objective situation is constantly increasing our burdens. How to further implement the democratic work style from top to bottom, inspire comrades' sense of ownership, and everyone think of ways to overcome the difficulties in the work and solve the various new problems encountered has become an urgent matter. Therefore, the leading cadres of the bank have always been grasping the organization of rationalization proposals relatively tightly in recent months.

	2. Having rational suggestions requires timely processing: Even if leading cadres promote a democratic work style and everyone actively puts forward suggestions, if a indifferent attitude is adopted towards suggestions and they are not specifically handled, the active ideological buds will still be quickly suppressed. Therefore, launching and organizing rationalization proposals is important, but timely processing of these proposals is even more important. For example, the bank published statistics on June 8 on the handling of 17 deposit-related proposals in May: Instructed the subordinate to follow four pieces, announced for each unit to consider and adopt separately five pieces, announced as educational cadre materials two pieces, official letter to other agencies to jointly handle one piece, partially adopted one piece, already similar methods implemented and not adopted one piece, under consideration two pieces, and inconvenient to adopt due to changes in the situation one piece.

	3. It is also very important to promote the style of "say everything you know, say everything you can" and give everyone the opportunity to speak. Different opinions are allowed to be discussed. Without freedom of speech, good opinions cannot be obtained; but without free debate, no conclusions can be reached. Therefore, in organizing rationalization proposals, organizing discussions and launching criticism are also indispensable. For example, when a suggestion is not very appropriate, other comrades will follow up with "consultation", "research", "further research" or "suggestion of suggestion", etc., so that the problem becomes more and more clear. If it is indeed not necessary to adopt, after the debate, at least the comrades who put forward the suggestion will have a deeper understanding. Taking the suggestions in May as an example, there were six different opinions proposed for discussion, some about institutions, some about cashier, some about domestic exchange, and some about deposits.

	4. Persist in implementing to the end: In the early stage, some comrades made suggestions and pointed out that a certain unit should pay attention to things. If they do not see any movement, they will be anxious due to a sense of responsibility. One comrade said in his "Suggestions for Handling Rationalization Proposals": "When readers see a suggestion published in the bulletin, they may think that it is just an article written casually, but it is not that simple. Every suggestion can be said to have gone through the process of observation, consideration, and research to be written out"; "Some are even written during vacation or by working overtime"; "If the suggestion is correct, the administration should adopt it or respond to it in a timely manner." The leading cadres of the bank immediately expressed their attitude: "We are determined to accept the suggestions of the suggestors and take responsibility to urge them to be implemented." The leaders and the led, the superiors and the subordinates, carried out the "rationalization proposals" in this mutual supervision and mutual encouragement.
