　　Procedures and Methods for Formulating State-Owned Industrial Plans
　　Xu Chi
    For nearly sixty years, the national industry, from its inception to its current meager scale, has been under the plunder and control of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. Consequently, what belongs to the people today is more raw material industry than manufacturing industry, and crude manufacturing industry is more prevalent than refined manufacturing industry. For example, iron ore mining far exceeds the need for iron smelting; iron smelting exceeds steelmaking, steelmaking exceeds steel rolling and steel products, and there is only ordinary steelmaking without special steelmaking. As for the machinery industry, there are no decent specialized manufacturing plants nationwide, but there are too many repair shops. This is enough to illustrate that the imperialists did not allow us to have an independent and complete industrial system, and the bureaucratic capitalists were only concerned with how to plunder the people and did not care about scientific factory management. Therefore, in the past, we not only did not have, but could not have, overall planning work. Even the statistical work necessary for internal factory management and production was pitifully weak!
    Now that everything belongs to the people, the proportion of industrial production in the development of the national economy must gradually increase, moving from recovery to prioritized and gradual new construction. Therefore, our state-owned industries must not only have plans, but these plans must be strict and prudent, because they are the most important link in the entire planned economy.
    For our comrades managing industry, planning work is completely new, but it must be established, otherwise our industrial production will not be able to get on the right track. Therefore, learning planning work and establishing planning work at all levels is the primary task for our comrades in industrial management positions today.
    (I) Planning Work System: For ease of explanation, please refer to the diagram below
     National State-Owned Industrial Plan
     ↓      ↑      ↓
     Industrial Economic Plan of the ×× Ministry of Industry
     ↓      ↑      ↓
     Professional Economic Plan of Each Specialized Bureau
     ↓      ↑      ↓
     Enterprise Plan
     Financial Plan  Basic Construction Plan  Product Sales Plan  Cost Plan
    Raw Material Supply Plan  Labor Plan  Product Plan
    The above diagram illustrates the system of industrial planning. Its compilation process can be divided into the following three stages:
    First: ↓ indicates that the higher-level planning authority transmits instructions and requirements for compiling the plan to the lower-level planning authority. That is, in order to compile the national state-owned economic plan, the Central Planning Bureau transmits instructions and requirements for compiling the plan to various ministries, requiring each ministry to compile a specific plan for that ministry based on the overall intention of the state. For example, after receiving instructions from the Central Government, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in order to compile the state-owned industrial economic plan of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, must also transmit instructions to the various specialized bureaus, requiring each bureau to compile a specialized economic plan. Of course, for each bureau to compile a specialized economic plan, it must also transmit instructions to its subordinate enterprises to compile enterprise economic plans.
    Second: ↑ indicates the submission of plans at all levels and the gradual consolidation. That is, after the enterprise plans are submitted, the specialized bureaus comprehensively review them and compile the specialized economic plans of each bureau. The specialized economic plans of each bureau are submitted to the ministry, and the ministry's planning department comprehensively reviews them and, based on the needs of the ministry and the supply and demand balance with other economic departments, compiles the state-owned industrial economic plan of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. The economic plans of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and other ministries are submitted to the Central People's Government, which is then consolidated by the Central Planning Bureau to compile the national state-owned industrial economic plan.
    Third: ↓ indicates that after the plan is approved, an order to execute it is transmitted. That is, after the Central People's Government approves the state-owned industrial economic plan and its constituent part—the industrial economic plan of the Ministry of Heavy Industry—it transmits the order to execute the plan to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which then transmits the execution order through the specialized bureaus to each enterprise, based on the approved plan.
    As can be clearly seen from the above planning work system, the enterprise is the basic link in compiling the industrial economic plan and the foundation for executing the plan. Therefore, in order to compile the industrial economic plan in a way that is realistic and can play a role in promoting production and construction, we must put effort into the enterprise plan.
    (II) Main Contents of the Industrial Economic Plan: The entire industrial economic plan includes seven parts, encompassing all economic content related to production and construction. Namely:
    (1) Product Plan: This is the core of the entire plan. This plan must be formulated first in order to compile the following series of other plans. It includes the technical norms for output, the utilization of production equipment, the types and quality of products, the quantity of products by month and quarter, and the technical conditions for completing the product plan.
    (2) Labor Plan: The labor plan is the first to be related to the completion of the product plan. It is unimaginable to complete the product plan without paying attention to organizing labor and improving labor productivity. This plan includes output labor quotas and personnel quotas, worker working time plans, wage plans, the classification and increase or decrease of employees, and employee welfare facilities.
    (3) Raw Material Supply Plan: This is the material basis for completing the product plan. Its content includes raw material consumption quotas per unit product, periodic raw material supply plans, the amount of auxiliary materials required, the amount of semi-finished products required, the amount of fuel, electricity, and water required, the purchase of tools and equipment, and the material source plan.
    (4) Cost Plan: This plan reflects the actual situation of how to organize labor, utilize the means of production, and complete production tasks. Its content includes the standard amount required per unit product, the cost of raw materials and wages, the cost of auxiliary materials and fuel, water, and electricity, the depreciation of fixed assets, the apportionment of indirect costs, and the planned cost per unit product.
    Since the cost plan is an overall manifestation of the product plan, labor plan, and raw material supply plan, the rise or fall of the planned cost is an indicator of the production performance of the enterprise. Therefore, it is meaningful that some people refer to the product plan, labor plan, and raw material supply plan collectively as the production plan.
    (5) Product Sales Plan: This is a blueprint for selling products. Its content includes the categories, quantities, and prices of finished products that have been produced, the balance between production and sales, the plan for allocating goods periodically, and the enterprise's income and surplus plan.
    (6) Basic Construction Plan: This is the main component of the entire state-owned industrial economic plan. In addition to the above-mentioned plans related to production, there is also the basic construction plan. All construction that can increase production capacity, whether new construction, restoration, renovation, or expansion, is included in the scope of basic construction. The content of this plan is first of all a directory of all construction projects, the budget for each project, the detailed content and progress plan for each project, up to and including the direct and indirect wages of employees, the amount of main and auxiliary materials required, and other indirect expenses are all included in the plan.
    (7) Financial Plan: This is a comprehensive budget for production and basic construction, indicating the turnover of production and the income and expenditure of basic construction investment and its results. This plan is used to grasp the respective balances of the two cycles of production turnover and basic construction in economic value. This plan includes: production expenditures, sales revenue, production profit plan, the enterprise's need for working capital and its sources, the enterprise's fund expenditure budget, the sources of basic construction investment and the periodic expenditure plan, which constitutes the total financial revenue and expenditure plan.
    (III) Methods and Steps for Compiling the State-Owned Industrial Economic Plan: First of all, it must be explained that compiling a plan is not done in the form of a lengthy report, but through a series of interconnected forms. The enterprise plan is filled out on the planning form used by the enterprise and submitted to the specialized bureaus. After researching and approving the planning forms submitted by the enterprises, each specialized bureau fills out the planning form used by the specialized bureau. The planning forms of each specialized bureau are submitted to the ministry, and the planning department within the ministry, in conjunction with other relevant departments, researches, reviews, and fills out the comprehensive planning form used by the ministry. This is the ministry's comprehensive plan. Submitted to the Central People's Government, the Central Planning Bureau then compiles the national state-owned industrial economic plan. Currently, the situation in the Ministry of Heavy Industry is: the format of the planning forms used by the ministry is formulated and issued by the Central Planning Bureau. The format of the planning forms used by the specialized bureaus within the ministry is formulated by the ministry's planning department based on the requirements of the Central Planning Bureau and the ministry. The format of the planning forms used by the enterprise is formulated by the ministry's planning department and the planning departments of the specialized bureaus based on the requirements of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the bureaus. Therefore, the forms used for compiling plans are strung together from top to bottom, and are based on the enterprise, gradually consolidated, and filled out on forms used at all levels, thus compiling plans at all levels.
    As mentioned above, the enterprise plan is the basis for compiling all plans. Before each enterprise formulates its plan, it must:
    First, establish technical operating procedures: Each production department within the enterprise, according to the requirements of its equipment and operations, the formal operating procedures and steps, and the quality specifications and quantities required for raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, lists the various items that should be strictly observed during the operation process as regulations. Taking a steelmaking plant as an example: the Martin furnace operating procedures must include: furnace type and size, capacity, the nature of the refractory materials used, the method of constructing various parts of the furnace, the nature and specifications of the various raw materials required, the nature and specifications of the fuel, the operating personnel at each position and their responsibilities, the time, quantity, and steps for hot or cold charging of raw materials, the time, quantity, and steps for batching and charging, when to take samples, when to tap steel, and various precautions in operation, as well as cold and hot repairs, etc., all contained in this procedure. Therefore, the technical operating procedure, for all personnel in the production department, is not only a production charter to be jointly observed, but also the main content of their business learning. On this basis, deviations that may occur in the process of production competitions, new record movements, and the creation of new quotas can be avoided.
    Second, determine technical and economic quotas through the calculation of various production indices: What is a production index? Here, the so-called index is not a mathematical index, nor is it merely a statistical index, but rather a calculation and comparison of everything related to production, such as equipment capacity, capabilities, working hours, production efficiency, consumption, and quality requirements. The calculation of production indices includes the following contents:
    A. Calculate the production capacity and achievable efficiency of each piece of equipment based on engineering principles, as the highest standard. This is the so-called economic index in engineering.
    B. Working Time Index. Taking a machine manufacturing factory as an example: the total calendar time must exclude the machine tool repair time and the technician's vacation to be the designated working time, and within the designated working time, the time for loading and unloading workpieces on the machine tool must be excluded to be the official processing time. The purpose of this series of calculations is to study how to increase the percentage of official processing time in the total calendar time.
    C. Utilization Index of Production Equipment. That is, to calculate the production efficiency based on the performance of the production equipment and operating results. For example, for a blast furnace (high furnace), calculate the effective volume inside the furnace required to smelt one ton of pig iron every 24 hours. The Martin furnace calculates the number of tons of steel produced per unit furnace bottom area per furnace. The power station calculates the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity supplied in a certain period of time. The machine tools in a machine manufacturing factory calculate the number of workpieces processed per unit time.
    D. Labor Index. That is, to calculate the number of operators required for each piece of production equipment, the quantity of products under a certain quality requirement per certain number of personnel, and the degree of mechanization in the entire labor organization.
    E. Consumption Index. Calculate the consumption per unit product from the consumption of all products. This consumption includes the raw materials, supplementary materials, fuel, electricity, water, steam, and labor required for production, and calculate and compare each workshop and each piece of production equipment.
    F. Quality Index. Refer to the international standard specifications of the product, according to the national statutory specifications, and through the determination and analysis of physical and chemical properties, calculate the level of product quality and the proportion of defective products, and make calculations and comparisons for each workshop and historically.
    Based on the calculation, research, and comparison of the above indices, we can determine the technical and economic quotas. For example, in item B, we can obtain labor-hour quotas. From item C, and with reference to item A, we can obtain the technical output quota for each piece of equipment. From item D, we can obtain the personnel quota required for each piece of equipment operation and the output labor quota for the average output per person. From item E, we can obtain the consumption quota for each product. From item F, we can obtain the quality quota for each type of product.
    Third, compile the enterprise plan based on technical and economic quotas: The above-mentioned quotas are collectively referred to as technical and economic quotas. This is the statutory standard, and each enterprise must submit its quotas for approval after determining them. The enterprise plan is compiled based on these quotas. Comrade Stalin said well: "Without technical and economic quotas, planned economy cannot be carried out." This instruction deserves our deep attention!
    (IV) Supervision and Inspection of Plan Execution: The work of planning departments at all levels is not just to compile plans and be done with it, but also to supervise and inspect the execution of established plans. Close attention must be paid to the achievements, difficulties, and twists and turns of the masses in executing the plan, as the basis for revising the plan, and timely reports on the execution situation must be submitted, so that the units executing the plan can receive appropriate assistance, rewards, and punishments from the higher levels in a timely manner. In addition, the creations, inventions, and technical improvements of advanced elements in the process of executing the plan must be disseminated to their colleagues at any time, so that they can learn from each other and keep up with new records and new quotas. This will enable the plan to guide production to the highest level. Planning is not empty talk, but a guide to mobilizing the strength of the masses to complete production tasks.
    But through what do we supervise and inspect? It depends on
    1. A sound statistical system.
    2. A periodic inspection system.
    In fact, the inspection system can only supplement the shortcomings of the statistical system, and mainly relies on the statistical system. The so-called sound statistical system starts with the statisticians in each workshop within the enterprise, and through the statistical units within the planning work agencies at all levels, the various activities in the execution of the plan are gradually consolidated, compiled, reported in tables, and reported up to the statistics office within the ministry's planning department. Statistical units at all levels must closely cooperate with the needs of planning work, consolidate the required figures on a regular basis, and raise questions at any time, so that planning departments at all levels face reality, pay attention to the existing and potential forces that may appear, not only supervise and inspect the execution of the plan, but also make up for the shortcomings in the established plan.
    What has been said above is only the economic plan of state-owned industry. In addition to state-owned industry, the Chinese economy also has a large number of private industries and an even larger amount of decentralized agricultural production. It is not yet possible to formulate as strict and complete economic plans for these private economies, especially decentralized mass production, as described above. However, completely lacking plans and allowing them to develop freely and compete blindly is also greatly detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we must convene various professional conferences of public and private enterprises to discuss preliminary production plans and supply and sales plans, and we should strengthen the leadership of the state-owned economy and strengthen the planning of the private economy through cooperatives and state capitalism, so that all their economic activities can also conform to the requirements of the entire country's economic construction. We are just beginning to work hard in this area, and our experience is not yet rich, so it is not possible to elaborate in detail.

　　制定国营工业计划的程序和方法
    徐驰
    近六十年来，全国工业由开始到具备了今天这一点薄弱的规模，是一直在帝国主义及官僚资本的劫夺与把持之下，因之今天所归于人民的，是原料工业多于制造工业，而粗制的制造工业又多于精制的制造工业。譬如铁矿的开采，大大超过炼铁的需要；而炼铁又多于炼钢，炼钢又多于轧制钢材及钢品，而又只有炼普通钢没有炼特殊钢，至于机器业，在全国没有像样的专业制造厂，却有过多的修配厂，这就足以说明：帝国主义者们不允许我们有独立的完整的工业体系，而官僚资本家们只关心于如何掠夺人民，不关心于科学的工厂管理，因之我们过去不但没有而且不可能有整体的计划工作，就是工厂内部管理生产所必需的统计工作，都薄弱得可怜！
    现在一切归于人民了，工业生产要在国民经济的发展中，逐渐增加其比重，由恢复走向有重点的按缓急的新建。因之我们的国营工业不但要有计划，而且这种计划是严格而慎密的，因为他是全部计划经济中最重要的一环。
    计划工作，对我们管理工业的同志们来说，是全新的，但必须建立，否则无法使我们的工业生产走入正轨，因之学会计划工作和建立起各级的计划工作，已是我们现在工业管理岗位上的同志们的首要任务了。
    （一）计划工作体系：为了易于说明，先参看下图
     全国国营工业计划
     ↓      ↑      ↓
     ××工业部工业经济计划
     ↓      ↑      ↓
     各专业局专业经济计划
     ↓      ↑      ↓
     企业计划
     财务计划  基本建设计划  产品推销计划  成本计划
    原材料供应计划  劳动计划  产品计划
    上图表明了工业计划的体系，它的编制程序可以分为以下三个阶段：
    第一：↓表示上级计划机关对下级计划机关传达编制计划的指示与要求，即是为了编制全国国营的经济计划，中央计划局传达对编制计划的指示与要求给各部，要各部根据国家总的意图，编制该部的具体计划。譬如重工业部，接中央指示后，为编制重工业部的国营工业经济计划，又必须传达指示给各专业局，要各该局编制专业经济计划，当然各局要编制专业经济计划，又须传达指示给其所属企业，编制企业的经济计划。
    第二：↓表示各级计划的送呈与逐级综合，即是各企业计划上缴后，由专业局综合审核，编制成各局的专业经济计划，各局的专业经济计划上缴至部，又由部的计划司综合审核，并根据本部需要及与其他经济部门的供求平衡而编制出重工业部的国营工业经济计划，重工业部及其他各部的经济计划上缴至中央人民政府，再由中央计划局综合起来，编制全国的国营工业经济计划。
    第三：↓表示计划经批准后，传达执行命令，即是中央人民政府批准了国营工业经济计划及其组成部分——重工业部的工业经济计划后，即传达执行该计划的命令给重工业部，重工业部则又经专业局至各企业，根据批准的计划，逐级传达执行命令。
    如上图这一计划工作的体系中，我们可清楚的看出，企业是编制工业经济计划的基本环节，又是执行计划的基础，因之要把工业经济计划编制得切合实际，且能在推动生产建设上起督促作用，则我们一定要在企业计划方面下工夫。
    （二）工业经济计划的主要内容：整个工业经济计划，包括七个部分，所有一切与生产及建设相关的全部经济内容都包括在内。即：
    （１）产品计划：这是全部计划的核心，要先订出这一计划来，才能编制下述一系列的其他计划，它包括产量的技术定额，生产设备的运用情况，产品之种类与质量，按月度及季度的产品数量，和完成产品计划的技术条件。
    （２）劳动计划：与完成产品计划首先发生关系的就是劳动计划，不注意组织劳动与提高劳动生产率，想完成产品计划，则是不可想像的，这一计划包括产量劳动定额与人员定额，工人工作时间计划，工资计划，员工的分类与增减情况及员工的福利设施。
    （３）原材料供应计划：这是完成产品计划的物质基础，它的内容包括单位产品的原材料消耗定额，按期的原材料供应计划，补助材料的需用量，半成品需用量，燃料，电及水的需用量，工具及器具的购置和材料的来源计划。
    （４）成本计划：这一计划反映了如何组织劳动，利用生产手段，完成生产任务的实际情况。它的内容包括单位产品所需标准量，原材料及工资的费用，补助材料及燃料水电的费用，固定资产的折旧，间接费用的分担，直至单位产品的计划成本。
    成本计划既为产品计划，劳动计划及原材料供应计划的总体表现，故计划成本之升降，即该企业生产成绩之指标，因之有人把产品计划，劳动计划及原材料供应计划，总称之为生产计划是有其意义的。
    （５）产品推销计划：这是一幅推销产品的蓝图，它的内容包括已生产的成品的类别，数量及价格，产销的平衡，按期拨出商品的计划，企业收入及盈余计划等。
    （６）基本建设计划：全部国营工业经济计划的主要组成部分，除上述有关生产的计划外，就是基本建设计划了。所有能增加生产能力的建设，无论新建恢复，改造及扩充，概包括在基本建设范围之内，这一计划，其内容首先是全部工程项目目录，每一工程的预算，每一工程的详细内容与进度计划，直至直接与间接的员工工资，主要材料与补助材料的需用量和其他间接费用都在计划之列。
    （７）财务计划：它是有关生产及基本建设的全盘预算，表明了生产的周转和基本建设投资的收支情况及其成果。通过这一计划来掌握生产周转及基本建设，在经济价值上的两个循环的各自平衡。这计划包括：生产支出，销货收入，生产利益计划，企业流动金的需要及其来源，企业基金支出预算，基本建设投资的来源及按期支出计划，这样来构成财务收支的总计划。
    （三）编制国营工业经济计划的方法和步序：首先要说明的是编制计划，不是用洋洋万言的报告书的形式，而是通过一系列的，上下有联系的表格来完成的。企业计划是填写在企业用的计划表上，汇交至各专业局，各专业局根据各企业缴来的计划表，研究审定后就填写专业局用计划表，各专业局计划表上缴至部，经部内计划司并会同其他有关各司。研究审定，填写部用综合计划表，这就是部的综合计划了。上缴至中央人民政府，即由中央计划局来编制全国的国营工业经济计划，现在重工业部的情况是：部用的计划表的格式是中央计划局制定发给的，部内各专业局用的计划表格式，则由部计划司根据中央计划局及部的要求而制定，企业用计划表格式，则由部计划司与专业局计划部门，根据重工业部及局的要求而制定。所以编制计划用表格，是由上到下一线穿成，而又是以企业作基础，逐级综合，填写各级用的表，这样编成了各级的计划。
    如上所述，企业计划是编制全部计划的基础。每一企业，在制订其计划之先，必须：
    第一、建立技术作业规程：企业内部各生产部门，按其设备及作业的要求与正规操作程序及步骤，原材料半成品及成品所要求之品质规格及数量，在操作过程所应注意格守各项，列为规章。以炼钢厂为例：马丁炉操作规程，必须包括：炉型尺寸，容量，所用耐火材料性质，修筑炉内各部的方法，所需各种原料的性质规格，燃料的性质规格，各岗位操作人员及其职守，热装或冷装原料之入炉时间数量及步骤，配料入炉之时间数量及步序，何时取样，何时出钢及操作上应注意各项，和冷修热修等规定，概载在此规程内。故技术作业规程，对该生产部门，全体人员来说，不但为其共守之生产宪章，且为其业务学习之主要内容。以此为基础，可免除在生产竞赛，新纪录运动及创造新定额等过程中可能发生的偏向。
    第二、通过各种生产指数的核算，来决定技术经济定额：什么叫生产指数？这里所谓指数，不是数学上的指数，也不只是统计学上的指数意义，而是有关生产的一切设备容量，能力，工作时间，生产效率，消耗情况及品质要求等等的计算与比较。生产指数的核算，包括下列各内容：
    甲、根据工程学理计算各设备的生产能力与可能达到的效率，以此作为最高标准。这就是所谓工程学上的经济指数。
    乙、工作时间指数。以机器制造厂为例：全部日历时间要除去机床的修理时间及技工的休假，方为指定工作时间，而指定工作时间内，又须除去机床上工作物之装卸时间，方为正式加工时间，这一系列的计算，其目的在研究如何提高正式加工时间在全部日历时间内所占的百分比。
    丙、生产设备的利用指数。即是根据生产设备性能和操作成绩来核算生产效率。譬如炼铁炉（高炉）要计算二十四小时内每炼一吨生铁所需之炉内有效容积，马丁炉则计算其每炼一炉，单位炉底面积之产钢吨数，电力站则计算其在一定时间内之供电度数，机器制造厂之机床，则计算其每单位时间加工工作物的件数。
    丁、劳动指数。即是计算每一生产设备，所需操作人员，每一定员在一定质量要求下的产品数量，及整个劳动组织中的机械化程度。
    戊、消耗指数。由全部产品的消耗，计算出单位产品的消耗，这个消耗是指生产所需的原材料，补充材料，燃料，电力，水，蒸气，人工都在内，并对各车间各生产设备作计算的比较。
    己、品质指数。参考产品的国际标准规格，根据国家法定规格，并通过物理性质及化学性质的检定分析，而计算产品质量之高下，及废品所占比率，并作各车间及历史上的计算比较。
    根据上述各指数的核算，研究与比较，我们就可决定出技术经济定额来。譬如乙项，我们可得出工时定额，由丙项并参考甲项，我们可得出每一设备之产量技术定额，由丁则可得出每一设备作业所需之人员定额及每人平均产量之产量劳动定额，由戊可得出每一产品之消耗定额，由己可得出每类产品之品质定额。
    第三、根据技术经济定额，来编制企业计划：上述各定额之总称为技术经济定额，这是法定标准，各企业决定定额后，须呈报批准。企业计划即依据这些定额来编制。斯大林同志说的好：“没有技术经济定额，就无法进行计划经济”。这一指示，值得我们深刻注意！
    （四）监督与检查计划的执行：各级计划部门的工作，不只编制计划，就算了事，还要监督与检查既定计划之执行。要密切注意，群众执行计划中的成绩，困难及波折，作修正计划的根据，并及时将执行情况提出报告，使执行计划各单位，及时获得上级之适当的帮助与奖惩。此外还须将执行计划过程中，先进分子的创造发明及技术改进，随时传播给他们的同业，使他们互相学习，向新纪录及新定额看齐，这样就会使计划引导着生产向最高水平前进，计划不是纸上谈兵，而是动员群众力量完成生产任务的向导。
    但是通过什么来督促与检查呢？要由
    １、健全的统计制度。
    ２、定期的巡视制度。
    事实上，巡视制度，只能补统计制度之不足，主要是依靠统计制度。所谓健全的统计制度是由企业内各车间里的统计员开始，经过各级计划工作机构内的统计单位，把执行计划的各种活动情况，逐级综合汇编，造表上报，直至部计划司内的统计室。各级统计单位要密切配合着计划工作的需要，按期综合所需数字，并随时提出问题。使各级计划部门面对现实，注意已出现及可能出现的潜在力量，不但督促与检查计划的执行，而且弥补既定计划中之缺陷。
    以上所讲的只是国营工业的经济计划。中国经济中除国营工业外，还有为数很大的私营工业，和数量更大的分散的农业生产。对于这些私营经济，尤其是分散的群众生产，要制定像前面那样严密的，完整的经济计划尚不可能。但完全没有计划，任其自由发展，盲目竞争，亦对国计民生大大不利。所以我们必须召开公私企业的各种专业会议来商议初步的生产计划和供销计划，并应加强国营经济的领导并通过合作社和国家资本主义等方式，以加强私营经济的计划性，使他们的一切经济活动亦能符合于整个国家的经济建设的要求。在这方面，我们正在开始努力，经验尚不丰富，所以还不可能详细申述。
