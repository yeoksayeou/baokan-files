　　Waste of Labor in Grain Transportation in Anyang, Pingyuan
　　Special Commissioner's Office and Regional Party Committee Order County to Investigate Responsibility
　　On July 8th, Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, experienced a waste of labor in the transportation of pre-purchased cotton and grain from the city warehouse, causing great losses to farmers, especially during the critical seedling cultivation season.
　　The main reason for this loss was the insufficient attention paid to the grain transportation work by the county Party committee and county government. Although meetings were held, only the allocation of numbers was discussed, and no attention was paid to accurate calculations, specific allocations, and organization of labor. The head of the Second Section of the county government believed that the handling fee belonged to the county cooperative and should be the responsibility of the county cooperative. The director of the county cooperative believed that the allocation and organization of manpower and livestock was the government's business and was not responsible for other matters besides handling procedures. Although there was a division of labor, there was no close cooperation. More seriously, the entire grain transportation plan was not formally notified. Jia Shunkui, a clerk of the business section of the county cooperative, casually notified the branches, saying, "The masses can pick up the grain whenever they want." As a result, on the 8th, vehicles and horses crowded the city warehouse. The head of the business section of the county cooperative was present at the time but did not actively try to remedy the situation, resulting in a chaotic phenomenon of serious waste of labor in grain transportation. It has now been found that eight villages, twenty-five large carts, six small carts, ninety-five head of livestock, and two hundred and four people were involved. Except for fifteen large carts that pulled back 16,000 catties of soybean cake loaned by the cooperative, the rest of the people, horses, and vehicles ran empty for a day in the hot weather. Afterwards, no report was made to the county, nor was a deep review conducted, demonstrating a serious lack of organization and discipline.
　　The occurrence of this incident shows that the personnel responsible for grain transportation in the county severely lack a serious and responsible attitude towards the country and the people. The Anyang Regional Party Committee and the Special Commissioner's Office have ordered the county to thoroughly investigate and order the responsible personnel to conduct self-criticism among the masses. Those with serious faults will be punished, and the losses of the masses will be appropriately compensated.
　　In order to complete the task of transporting more than 39 million catties of public grain into warehouses, the Special Commissioner's Office has ordered all counties' grain requisition committees to make very careful and comprehensive calculations, clarify responsibilities, and be responsible for inspections, to ensure that no manpower or animal power is wasted, that people have boiled water to drink, and that livestock are not trapped. They should also use contracts based on local conditions to organize the exchange of goods in the interior, so that grain transportation does not interfere with production.

　　Editor's Note: Large-scale grain transportation is a heavy and rigorous organizational work. If it is not well organized in advance, it will waste national manpower and material resources, causing undue losses to farmers. The grain transportation work in Liaocheng Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, and the transportation of a large amount of public grain into warehouses in Anyang County both resulted in a large waste of manpower and animal power during the busy farming season due to the lack of accurate and detailed planning in advance. The main reason is that the departments and personnel responsible for leading and planning this work have serious bureaucratic styles and extremely lack a mass perspective. They are unscientific in their working methods, do not follow regulations when contracts are in place, and do not notify the reasons why grain cannot be released on time in advance. This phenomenon occurred after the Puyang grain transportation incident in Pingyuan Province in February this year and should not have happened. The China Grain Company and relevant departments responsible for grain transportation this time, as well as the leadership of Anyang County, should conduct public self-criticism and correct their work styles.

### 平原安阳运粮工作中浪费民力  专署、地委令该县追查责任

　　平原安阳运粮工作中浪费民力
    专署、地委令该县追查责任
    平原省安阳县七月八日从市仓库起运预购棉花、粮食中，发生了浪费民力，特别是在紧张的锄苗季节，使农民遭受了极大的损失。
    造成这种损失的主要原因，是县委、县府对运粮工作重视不够，虽经开会，但只讨论了分配数目字，对精确计算、具体调拨、组织民力等工作则未加过问。县府二科科长认为手续费归县社，应由县社负责；县社主任认为调拨组织人畜力是政府的事，除办手续外不负其他责任。虽有分工，但无密切配合。更严重的是，整个运粮计划没有明文通知，县社营业科员贾顺魁随便通知分社说：“群众什么时候去取，什么时候有粮食”。结果，八日到市仓库取粮的车马拥挤不堪，当时县社营业科长在场，也没有积极想法补救，造成了运粮中的严重浪费民力的混乱现象。现已查清有八个村，二十五辆大车、六辆小车、九十五头牲口、二百零四人，其中除十五辆大车拉回合作社贷放豆饼一万六千斤外，其余人马车辆，都在炎热的天气下，往返空跑了一天。事后，又不向县作报告，也未深刻检讨，表现了严重的无组织无纪律现象。
    这一事件的发生，表现了该县负责运粮工作的人员，十分缺乏对国家对人民严肃负责的态度。安阳地委及专署已令该县彻底追查，令各负责人员在群众中进行自我批评，过失严重者，予以处分，并适当补偿群众损失。
    为完成三千九百多万斤公粮起运入仓任务，该专署已令各县征粮委员会，必须十分认真地通盘精确计算，明确责任，负责检查，确实做到不浪费一人一畜之力，保证人有开水喝，牲口不受困，并应根据当地不同条件，运用合同，组织内地物资交流，做到运粮不误生产。

    编者按：大规模调运粮食，是一个繁重而严密的组织工作。如果事先组织不好，就会浪费国家人力物力，而使农民受到不应有的损失。平原省聊城专区与东北调运粮食工作，及安阳县运输大量公粮入库工作中，均因事先缺乏精确周密计划，致在农忙时期浪费了大量人力畜力。其主要原因，是负责领导、计划这一工作的部门与人员，作风上存在严重的官僚主义，极端缺乏群众观点，而在工作方法上不科学，订有合同却不按规定办事，事先又不通知粮食不能按时放运原因。这种现象发生在今年二月平原省濮阳运粮事件之后，是不应该的。此次负责调运粮食的中国粮食公司及有关部门、安阳县领导方面，应该公开进行检讨，改正作风。
