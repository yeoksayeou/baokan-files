　　Zhejiang Lanxi Department Store Branch Blindly Dumps Goods
　　The Lanxi branch of the Zhejiang Provincial China Department Store Company, in order to complete its sales quota, has unreasonably lowered the listed prices of various goods. For example, the price of "Ship Brand" soap was 118,000 yuan per case in Hangzhou on May 18th, and 130,000 yuan in Jinhua and Lanxi. In the week that followed, prices in Hangzhou rose slightly, reaching 126,000 yuan for "Ship Brand" soap on the 25th. The price in Jinhua remained unchanged, while Lanxi gradually decreased, dropping to 118,000 yuan on the 25th. Furthermore, the company sold white sugar, which had been transferred from Hangzhou at 430,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), for only 390,000 yuan. This not only did not include transportation costs, but was also lower than the cost price. The selling prices of other items such as cotton cloth, toothpaste, and scented soap were not only lower than those in Jinhua, but for several days were also 3.75% to 9.3% lower than those in Hangzhou. Calculating the cost of goods and the selling prices, the loss amounted to approximately 30 million yuan. This not only affected reasonable price differences between regions, but also showed a lack of consideration for local private industry and commerce.
　　The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce has now notified its affiliated professional companies to pay closer attention to this deviation, and pointed out that the errors of the Lanxi branch of the department store company must be examined and corrected in a timely manner.

　　Editor's Note: One of the important tasks of state-owned department stores is to regulate the market and stabilize prices. The error of the Lanxi branch lies in blindly dumping goods, which not only causes undue losses to state capital, but also strains the relationship between public and private sectors. This is one of the bad examples of economic department workers failing to study policy. It should serve as a warning to all economic workers.

　　浙江兰溪百货支公司盲目倾销
    浙江省中国百货公司兰溪支公司，为了完成销货任务，将各货的牌价压低得很不合理。例如船牌肥皂的价格，五月十八日杭州价每箱为十一万八千元，金华、兰溪为十三万元，此后一周间，杭州物价微升，至二十五日船牌肥皂涨至十二万六千元，金华牌价不动，而兰溪则反而逐步下降，至二十五日竟低到十一万八千元。又该公司将从杭州拨去四十三万元一担的白糖，仅按三十九万元售出。这不但未加运费，并且比成本还低。其他如棉布、牙膏、香皂等售价，非但低于金华，有几天比杭州还低百分之三·七五至百分之九·三不等。若核算其进货成本和出售价格，亏损约达三千万元。这样不但影响了地区间之合理差价，且对当地私营工商业缺乏兼顾的精神。
    现浙江省商业厅已将此一偏差通报所属各专业公司加强注意，并指出百货公司兰溪支公司的错误必须加以检讨，及时纠正。

    编者按：国营百货公司的重要任务之一，是调节市场，稳定物价。兰溪支公司的错误，就在于盲目倾销，不仅使国家资本受到不应有的损失，而且使公私关系趋于紧张。这就是经济部门工作人员中，不学习政策的坏典型之一。应当引起一切经济工作人员的警惕。
