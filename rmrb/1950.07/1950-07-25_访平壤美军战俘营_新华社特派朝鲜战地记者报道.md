Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent on the Korean Battlefield reports:

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 24th] This agency's special battlefield correspondent reports: On the 19th, the reporter visited an American POW camp here. This POW camp is located in an elementary school and holds a total of one hundred and fourteen American prisoners.

　　These representatives of so-called "American culture and way of life," however, are mostly illiterate. The majority of them enlisted in the military hoping to enjoy the preferential treatment and extra allowances of occupation forces stationed abroad. Although most came from Japan, many did not even know where Korea was before arriving. They mostly do not want to fight and die. A Lieutenant Nugent of the 21st Regiment of the American 24th Division said, "I can't think of any reason for an American soldier to fight here." "We left a few hours after receiving orders, we didn't want to come at all."

　　However, there are also many like Air Force Lieutenant Sellman who are typical Hitlerite elements. Sellman grew up in a well-to-do family and has never done an honest day's work in his life. He is a jet fighter pilot who has bombed towns and villages here. He said, "I don't know where I'm going, but when I receive orders, I carry them out. If civilians are affected in the war, then they are just out of luck. When we bomb from 20,000 feet in the rain, how can we know what we hit? If we were ordered to destroy a village, I would think it very reasonable."

　　But no matter how advanced American mechanized equipment is, soldiers like these cannot defeat the Korean people. Pulling them out of jazz music, fine wine, and women to throw them into war results in a group of well-equipped puppets. This explains why MacArthur lied to them, saying that if they were captured, they would be slaughtered or mistreated. MacArthur wanted them to desperately fight to the death.

　　Sergeant Harrington of the 34th Regiment of the American 24th Division, who was captured, said, "We should not slaughter the Korean people, we should leave immediately. These people treat us very well. They have done everything they can for us. Even doctors come to see us twice a day. If MacArthur says we are all dead, then his heart is too despicable."

　　Now, these American prisoners broadcast every night to their comrades in southern Korea, telling them to lay down their weapons and surrender to the Korean People's Army, telling them that they will be treated leniently here.

### 访平壤美军战俘营  新华社特派朝鲜战地记者报道

　　访平壤美军战俘营
    新华社特派朝鲜战地记者报道
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】本社特派战地记者报道：记者于十九日访问了此间的一个美军战俘营。这个战俘营是在一所小学校里，共有一百十四名美国俘虏。
    这些所谓“美国文化和生活方式”的代表们，却有一大半不能读书写字。他们大部分是希图享受驻国外的占领军的优待和额外津贴而从军的。他们虽然大都来自日本，但是许多人在来到之前连朝鲜在那里都不知道。他们大都不愿打仗送死。美国第二十四师二十一团的一个上尉牛金特说：“我想不出一个美国兵有任何理由在这里作战。”“我们在接到命令几小时后就出发了，我们根本就不想来。”
    但是，其中也有许多像空军中尉塞尔曼这样的真正希特勒分子的典型。塞尔曼是在生活优裕的家庭里长大的，有生以来就没有干过一天正当的工作。他是一架喷气式战斗机的驾驶员，曾经轰炸过这里的城镇和乡村。他说：“我不知道我到那里去，但当我接到命令时，我便执行。如果老百姓在战争中受到波及，那么他们就太倒霉了。当我们在雨中从两万英尺高空轰炸时，我们怎么能晓得炸中了什么呢？假使我们被命令去破坏一个村庄，我认为这是很有理由的。”
    但是，无论美国的机械化装备怎么样，像这样的兵士，是不能击败朝鲜人民的。把他们从爵士音乐与醇酒妇人中拖出来去投入战争中，其结果便是一群装备优良的木偶人。这就说明了麦克阿瑟为什么要向他们扯谎说：假使他们被俘，一定要被屠杀或受虐待。麦克阿瑟是要他们绝望地去拚命。
    被俘虏的美军第二十四师第三十四团中士哈明顿说：“我们不应该屠杀朝鲜人民，我们应该立即走开。这些人民对待我们很好。他们对我们是尽了一切力量了。甚至每天还有医生来看我们两次。如果麦克阿瑟说我们都死了的话，那他的心地太卑鄙了。”
    现在，这些美国俘虏们每晚都向他们在朝鲜南部的伙伴们广播，叫他们放下武器，向朝鲜人民军投降，告诉他们：他们到这里将受到宽大待遇。
