　　Rural Areas in Land Reform Completion Areas Take on a New Look
    Farmers' Purchasing Power Increases, and Industry and Commerce Gradually Prosper

    [Report from this newspaper] Currently, across the country, the land reform has been completed or basically completed in the entire Northeast, most of North China, and part of Henan, covering approximately 145 million agricultural population. In all areas that have undergone land reform, rural productive forces have been liberated, and the rural landscape has been renewed. Simultaneously, industry and commerce are also gradually prospering.

            Industrial Market Gradually Expands, Commercial Operations Become Increasingly Prosperous

    In terms of industry and commerce: The purchasing power of 30 million farmers in Northeast China has greatly increased after the land reform, and the market for industrial products is gradually expanding. For example, the Northeast region sold 800,000 bolts of cloth in 1947, 1.2 million bolts in 1948, and 3.2 million bolts in 1949. It is estimated that it may reach 9 million bolts in 1950.

    After the land reform in the former Taihang area of North China in 1946, factories produced large quantities of machines such as flywheel cotton gins, electric cotton gins, and electric looms. Handicraft industry in North China has also greatly developed, with 430,000 spinning wheels and 100,000 looms. At the same time, commerce is also becoming increasingly prosperous. Taking Changzhi city as an example, when it was first liberated in October 1945, there were only 340 established merchants. After the land reform, this number increased to more than 1,300.

    In the seven counties of the Xuchang area of Henan, due to the resolute implementation of the policy of protecting industry and commerce during the land reform, appropriate compensation was also made for some industrial and commercial enterprises that had been infringed upon in the past. Industrial and commercial operators' concerns have been allayed, and they have begun to operate boldly, gradually turning various towns towards prosperity. Taking Jiaxian county as an example, after the land reform, the county added 16 factories, 128 commercial establishments, 11 traveling merchants, 27 traveling shops, 4 cooperatives, and 716 vendors. Industry and commerce in other counties such as Linru and Lushan have also developed considerably.

    Wearing New Clothes, Building New Houses, Living Standards Generally Rise

    In terms of farmers' lives: As a result of prospering through labor and production, farmers' living standards are gradually rising. For example, in the Feiketu district of Acheng county and the Yuanbao village of Shangzhi county in Songjiang province, 60% of the farmers wore new cotton-padded clothes last winter. In 1948, farmers in the Northeast only requested white cotton cloth and salt, but this year they want fine cloth and colored cloth.

    In Shexian county (now under Hebei province) of the former Taihang area, in 1945, farmers had an average income of four shi (a unit of dry measure) of grain per person, with average expenditures of two shi and nine dou (another unit of dry measure), leaving a surplus of one shi and one dou. In 1946, the average income was four shi and five dou, the average expenditure was three shi, and the surplus was one shi and five dou. From this, we can also see the increase in farmers' production and the rise in living standards after the land reform.

    Wang Size, a farmer in Xigou village, Pingshun county, Shanxi province, once said a passage that vividly illustrates the specific situation of the rising living standards of the villagers after the land reform. He said, "In the past, we ate bran and vegetables, wore patched clothes, the whole family shared one quilt, and lived in houses made of corn stalks. Now, one person has one quilt, can lay a felt mat, and even has a cotton robe in winter. This year, we built three new houses."

    Farmers' Awareness and Organization Improve, Consolidating the Rural People's Democratic Dictatorship

    In terms of political awareness: In areas that have undergone land reform, farmers' awareness and organization have greatly improved. For example, during the land reform process in the new areas of North China, farmers' representative meetings were widely held in various places, and farmers' associations were established. According to statistics from the Baoding area of Hebei province, more than 200,000 members were developed in farmers' associations. In the new area of Yuci county, Shanxi province, more than 80% of the farmers joined the farmers' association.

    After the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, 263 villages have established farmers' association organizations, with 116,491 members. In addition, 222 villages have established CCP branches, and 201 villages have established Communist Youth League branches. A total of 668 farmers have been approved to join the Communist Party of China.

    Nearly 20,000 advanced farmers in the Xuchang area of Henan have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. The farmers' association has more than 900,000 members, and the militia has approximately 51,000 people. Due to the increased political awareness of the broad masses of farmers and their active participation in organizations, the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas has been consolidated, and unprecedented close unity has been achieved among all democratic strata.

    Actively Study Politics and Culture, Widely Carry Out Recreational Activities

    In terms of cultural learning: After the land reform, farmers urgently demand improvement in cultural life. According to a recent Xinhua News Agency report, after the completion of land reform in the old liberated areas of North China, more than 3.6 million farmers participated in winter schools. Generally, they can recognize about 200 characters, and those with better results can recognize more than 600 characters. They can already write daily notes and simple letters. Some farmers happily said, "We both farm and study, and now every family has someone who can write!" Based on this urgent desire of farmers to learn culture, plans to eliminate illiteracy have been initially formulated in various places.

    In the Xuchang area of Henan, in addition to political and cultural studies, rural theatrical troupes are also very active. Farmers enthusiastically compose their favorite dramas based on their own experiences after liberation, such as "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "The White-Haired Girl," "Li Bao's Emancipation," and "Happy First Year."

    In Northeast China, 900,000 farmers participate in year-round learning, and more than 20,000 winter schools have been transformed into people's schools. In addition, there are more than 40,000 study groups. The farmers' enthusiasm for learning is very high. (Zuo Ke)

　　土地改革完成地区农村气象焕然一新
    农民购买力提高工商业逐渐繁荣
    【本报讯】目前在全国范围内，已有东北全部、华北大部及河南一部，约一亿四千五百万农业人口的地区完成或基本上完成了土地改革。凡是经过土地改革的地区，农村生产力获得解放，农村面貌已是焕然一新，同时工商业也逐渐繁荣起来。
            工业市场逐渐扩大  商业经营日趋繁荣
    在工商业方面：东北三千万农民在土地改革后购买力大为提高，工业品的销售市场逐渐扩大。如一九四七年东北区销售的布匹是八十万匹，一九四八年是一百二十万匹，一九四九年则是三百二十万匹，一九五○年预计可能达到九百万匹。
    华北原太行区于一九四六年土地改革后，工厂里大批出产了飞轮轧花机、电力弹花机、电力织布机等机器。华北区手工业也有很大发展，现有纺车四十三万辆，织布机十万架。同时，商业也日趋繁荣，仅就长治一市统计，一九四五年十月刚解放时，只坐商三百四十户，土改后，增至一千三百多户。
    河南许昌专区七个县在土地改革中，由于坚决执行保护工商业政策，对于过去某些被侵犯的工商业也作了适当的补偿，工商业者顾虑解除，已开始大胆经营，使各个城镇逐渐转向繁荣。以郏县为例，土地改革后，全县增加工厂十六家，商业一百二十八户，行商十一户，行店二十七户，合作社四处，摊贩七百一十六户。其余临汝、鲁山等县工商业亦有相当发展。
    穿新衣盖新屋  生活普遍上升
    在农民生活方面：由于劳动发家生产致富的结果，农民生活日趋上升。如松江省阿城县蜚克图区和尚志县元宝村的农民，去年冬天百分之六十都穿上了新棉衣。一九四八年，东北农民只要求有白土布和食盐，今年则要细布和花布了。
    原太行区涉县（现属河北省）农民于一九四五年，每人平均收入粮食四石，平均支出为二石九斗，剩余为一石一斗，一九四六年平均收入为四石五斗，平均支出为三石，剩余为一石五斗。从这里也可以看出土改后的农民生产提高与生活上升的情况。
    山西省平顺县西沟村农民王四则曾说过一段话，很生动地表明了该村农民在土地改革后生活上升的具体情形。他说：“过去俺吃的是糠菜，穿的是疙瘩衣裳，全家人伙盖一条被子，用玉茭秆围起来就顶房子住。现在，一个人盖一条被子，能铺块毡子，冬天还有件棉袍子。今年又新盖了三间房子。”
    农民觉悟性与组织性提高  巩固了农村人民民主专政
    在政治觉悟方面：经过土地改革的地方，农民的觉悟性与组织性大大提高。如华北新区在土地改革过程中，各地曾普遍召开了农民代表会，并成立了农会。据河北保定专区统计，农会会员发展了二十多万；山西榆次县新区农民有百分之八十以上加入了农会。
    北京市郊区土地改革完成后，已有二百六十三个村建立了农民协会的组织，会员达十一万六千四百九十一人。另外，有二百二十二个村建立了中共支部，二百零一个村建立了青年团支部。农民被批准加入中国共产党的共有六百六十八人。
    河南许昌专区将近两万先进农民加入了共产党及青年团。农民协会会员达九十余万，民兵武装约五万一千多人。由于广大农民政治觉悟提高和纷纷参加了组织，农村中人民民主专政的基础已巩固起来，各民主阶层也达到了空前的紧密团结。
    积极学习政治文化  广泛开展文娱活动
    在文化学习方面：土地改革后，农民迫切要求文化生活的提高。据最近新华社报道，华北老解放区完成土地改革后，各地参加冬学的农民达三百六十多万，一般都能认二百字左右，成绩较好的能认六百多字，已能写日用便条和简单的信件。有的农民高兴地说：“又种庄稼又念书，如今真是家家出了写字人啦！”在农民这种迫切要求学习文化的基础上，各地都初步拟定了扫除文盲的计划。
    河南许昌专区翻身农民，除政治、文化学习外，农村剧团也很活跃。农民以自己翻身后的亲身体验，热烈编排着自己所喜爱的戏剧，如《王贵与李香香》、《白毛女》、《李保翻身》、《快乐第一年》等。
    在东北各地参加常年学习的农民即达九十万人，二万多个冬学转建为民校，另外设有学习小组四万多个。农民学习的情绪很高。        （左克）
