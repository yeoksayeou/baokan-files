　　North China, Central South, Southwest, and Shaanxi
    Military Regions Launch Peace Signature Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th] Under the call of the China Committee for World Peace, troops of the North China, Central South, Southwest, and Shaanxi Military Regions have universally launched peace signature campaigns. The vast majority of commanders and fighters in the North China and Central South Military Regions have successively signed the peace declaration. In many units, the number of signatories has reached 100%. In the Southwest Military Region, the Western Sichuan Military District alone has over 84,600 signatories. The number of participants in the Shaanxi Military Region has reached 95% of the total number of personnel. During the signature campaign, the troops enthusiastically discussed the current international situation and conducted patriotic and internationalist education, strengthening the awareness of all commanders and fighters regarding the peace signature campaign.
    In the North China Military Region, some troops jointly convened peace signature rallies with the local people, or used wall posters and rooftop broadcasts to mobilize local people to participate in the signature campaign. For example, a cavalry division in the Suiyuan Military District mobilized 21 villages and 1,370 villagers to sign. In the Central South Military Region, some illiterate soldiers asked others to hold their hands and write their names on the signature book. A cook named Ren Gui, who was too ill to get out of bed, repeatedly urged a purchasing agent to write his name on the signature book for him. Many troops held solemn oaths during the signing, expressing their firm will to defend the motherland and safeguard world peace. After signing, soldiers in many units of the Shaanxi Military Region also voluntarily wrote pledges to defend world peace.

　　华北中南西南及陕西
    各军区展开和平签名
    【新华社二十四日讯】华北、中南、西南及陕西各军区部队在中国保卫世界和平大会号召下，普遍展开和平签名运动。华北及中南两个军区的全体指战员，绝大部分已相继在和平宣言上签了名。许多单位签名人数已达百分之百。西南军区仅川西军区一地已有八万四千六百余人签名。陕西军区参加签名人数，已达总人数的百分之九十五。在签名期间，各部队热烈地讨论了目前国际形势，并进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育，加强了全体指战员对和平签名运动的认识。
    华北军区，有些部队和驻地人民联合召开了保卫世界和平签名大会，或者用墙报、屋顶广播等方式发动驻地人民参加签名。例如绥远军区有一个骑兵师发动了驻地二十一个村子和一千三百七十名老乡签了名。中南军区有些不会写字的战士，请别人扶着手把名字写在签名书上。一个病得不能起床的炊事员任贵，再三叮嘱一位采买员，一定要代他把名字写在签名书上。很多部队在签名时，举行了庄严的宣誓，表示自己的保卫祖国，保卫世界持久和平的坚决志愿。陕西军区许多单位的战士签名后，还自动地写了保卫世界和平决心书。
