　　Seventh Factory Sixty Institute
    Workers Gradually Improve Tools Output Quality Continues to Improve
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the Sixth Institute of the Seventh Factory switched to peaceful industry, the workers have gradually mastered new production technologies, improved tools, and increased output and quality. In the initial stage of the transition to peaceful industry, the institute only made some odd jobs such as plate knives, milling cutters, and screw jacks, and there was no long-term production task. In February of this year, the higher authorities assigned the production task of 200 sets of six-inch three-jaw chucks, and then successively increased to 800 sets. In this way, the production goal was fixed for a longer period. During this period, workers had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the production process of a certain product. Familiarity breeds skill, and they gradually improved their technology, and both output and quality were improved. Turner Wei Liuyi could only make seven pieces a day when he first turned the inside of the disc body. After improving the working method, he can now make twenty pieces a day. Turner Du Yongshou could make seven pieces of the outside of the disc body a day, and the highest was twenty pieces. Liang Chao-ren ground the plane of the chuck jaw, estimating 27 pieces, and he made up to 48 pieces. Later, he replaced the short grinding wheel shaft and installed a pressure ball, which increased to 100 pieces per day. Chen Zhongli rubbed the small figure-eight wheel square, estimating 18 pieces a day. At first, he couldn't do it, but later he could do up to 36 pieces. In the past, when dividing squares, a crank was used to divide them, but later the screw wheel was removed and "aligned" by hand, and 100 pieces could be made per day. Yang Jiyu and Zhang Delin turned the teeth of the small figure-eight wheel, estimating 12 pieces, and at most 15 pieces. After improving the tools, they could turn 28 pieces a day. In the past, a maximum of 60 pieces of chuck jaw thread could be made. After improving the tools, it was increased to 180 pieces. Feng Xiaogong turned the small figure-eight wheel hole of the disc body, estimating 14 pieces a day. After changing to a turning tool, he could make up to 50 pieces a day. Recently, he and Shang Lizhen have been turning the chuck jaws into shape. In the past, they could turn up to six discs a day, but now they can make 13 discs. Chu Zirong turned the small figure-eight wheel eye. Others could make up to 40 pieces a day, but he made 86 pieces. Fan Qixian ground more than four sets of finished chucks every day. He suggested replacing the short grinding wheel shaft, and then he could grind eight sets a day. Most of the chuck parts have increased by one to three times. Not only has the output increased, but the quality has also greatly improved. In the past, the finished chucks made were skewed by 20 to 30 silks (the engineering department stipulates that 20 silks or less is qualified), but now the most skewed does not exceed 10 silks, generally skewed by four or five silks, and the good ones are only skewed by two silks.

　　七十兵工厂第六所
    工人逐步改进工具产量质量不断提高
    【本报讯】七十兵工厂第六所自转为和平工业以来，工友逐渐掌握了新的生产技术，改进工具，提高了产量与质量。转为和平工业初期，该所只做些板刀、铣刀、绞杠等零活，没有一个较长时期的生产任务。今年二月间，上级交给了做二百套六英寸三爪卡盘的生产任务，以后又陆续增加到八百套。这样，生产目标便较长时期地固定下来。工友在这一时期，由于有机会熟悉某种产品的生产过程，熟中生巧，逐渐改进技术，产量、质量都得到提高。车工魏六一，最初车盘体内部，每天只能做七个，改进工作方法后，现在每天可做二十个。车工杜永寿，车盘体外部，每天七个，最高做到二十个。梁朝仁磨卡盘爪平面，估工二十七块，他最多做到四十八块。后来他换了短砂轮轴，又装上一个压力滚珠，每天提高到一百块。陈中立擦小八字轮方，估工每天十八个。开始还做不出来，后来最多做到三十六个。以前分方时，用摇把分，后来去掉了螺旋轮用手搬“对道”每天能做一百个，杨辑玉、张德林旋小八字轮齿，估工十二个，最多做到十五个，经过改进工具，每天即能旋二十八个，卡盘爪车扣以前最多做到六十块。改进了工具后，提高到一百八十块。冯孝功车盘体小八字轮孔，估工每天十四个。经改用旋刀旋，每天最多做过五十个。最近他和尚立珍车卡盘爪成形，以前每天最多车过六盘，现在做到十三盘。褚子荣车小八字轮眼，别人每天最多做四十个，他做到八十六个。范启先磨卡盘成品每天磨四套多，他建议换了短砂轮轴后，每天能磨八套。大部分卡盘零件都提高了一倍到三倍多。不但在产量上提高了。而且在质量上也有了很大的进步。以前做出来的卡盘成品，歪二十丝到三十丝（工程科规定二十丝以内为合格），现在最歪不超过十丝，一般歪四、五丝，好的只歪两丝。
