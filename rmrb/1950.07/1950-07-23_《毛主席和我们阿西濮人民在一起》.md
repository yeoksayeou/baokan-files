《Chairman Mao and Our Axi People Are Together》
    Zhan Chao
    In March the trees sprout,
    Suddenly the world brightens,
    A Mao Zedong emerged;
    Though the bee's stinger still remains on people,
    The hateful reactionary government has been overthrown,
    The Axi people on West Mountain are living a good life!
    In our ancient mountainous area,
    Giggles resound in all directions...
    The charming sanxian (three-stringed lute) echoes the cheerful flute. Victory-filled West Mountain is full of joyful sounds everywhere. Old A'a (Grandpa) and A'ma'a (Grandma) can sleep comfortably in their own houses. Young A'mu (Big Brother) and A'meili ruo (Big Sister) can play together again after returning from working in the fields. "This is all thanks to Chairman Mao," an old Axi said with certainty. Her life experience told her that no one but the Communist Party and Chairman Mao thought of pulling the Axi people out of the abyss of suffering.

    The Axi people are a branch of the Yi ethnic group. Many years ago, they were driven around by the reactionary rulers and finally settled in the deep mountains and ridges west of Mile County, Yunnan. The ancestors of the Axi people worked hard with their own hands and finally cultivated small plots of farmland in the gaps between the stone mountains, planting corn and beans that they brought from the northwest. They painstakingly gained a foothold in this way, multiplied and raised offspring, and gradually spread throughout West Mountain. There are now more than 20,000 of them. The elders still vaguely remember how their villages were created. Liu Yingkui, seventy-eight years old, said, "When I was young, this village was still a barren mountain covered with dense trees." He pointed to the house I was staying in and said, "This was originally a cave with a python sleeping inside." The simple and diligent Axi people opened up West Mountain in the struggle against poisonous snakes and fierce beasts.

    They painstakingly managed the uneven and stony West Mountain, but they still could not get enough to eat and wear throughout the year. Even so, those great Han chauvinist reactionary rulers did not let them go. During the reactionary Qing government's rule, some local tyrants and evil gentry began to extend their power to West Mountain, forcibly occupying the land of the Axi people, and then imposing heavy taxes and levies on them. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the exploitation of the Axi people became even more severe. In addition to demanding grain, taxes, and conscription, Chiang Kai-shek's troops went up West Mountain in groups of three or five, carrying guns to seize pigs and slaughter sheep. Anyone who resisted would be arrested. At this time, the claws of French imperialism extended to West Mountain along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. They built churches, established schools, and implemented imperialist cultural aggression.

    The brave Axi people waged a heroic struggle for their freedom and liberation. When Axi youths studying in Mile and Kunming were baptized by progressive ideas after the "December 1st" democratic movement in 1945, they began to recognize the Communist Party, and some joined the Communist Party of China. Under the leadership and assistance of the Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou Border Region Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, this group of advanced Axi people established the first Axi people's armed force in the winter of 1947 and launched a heroic armed struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gang. The Axi people and the Sani, Miao, Buyi, and Han people of Guishan were closely united and smashed many "sweeps" by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. This spring, with the help of the People's Liberation Army entering Yunnan, the Chiang Kai-shek troops were finally wiped out. West Mountain was completely liberated.

    Chiang Kai-shek's troops carried out cruel burning, killing, and looting on West Mountain. Most of the houses of the Axi people were burned down by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Twenty-nine of the thirty-two households in Maichong Village had their houses burned down. But the Axi people are strong. When they had no houses to live in, they moved to the top of the mountain and built sheds in the forest. The men joined the militia guerrillas, and the women took care of household chores. In emergencies, they buried their belongings. They would rather let the grain mold than let Chiang Kai-shek's troops steal half a grain. The arduous struggle finally achieved victory.

    The situation on West Mountain is completely different after liberation. Huang Zhenxing, a sixty-two-year-old hero from Youzhadi Village, excitedly told me after recounting the story of fighting guerrillas: "The Communist Party is 'Zhua Hua Luo' (extremely good)! They do good things for the Han people, and they also do good things for the Axi people. In the past, when Han people saw Axi people on the street, they called them 'Lolo'. Now they don't call them that anymore! In the past, Han people kicked the Axi people's rice bags and asked the price. Now they discuss things face to face. The Axi people and the Han people are equal, all because of the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." The old Axi also told me something that moved him very much. Once, the village farmers' association notified him to attend a meeting to discuss mutual assistance and exchange labor. Because he was sick, he didn't go. When he recovered and went to the field, he saw that others had already done all the work for him.

    The Axi people are now actively building their homes. The houses of more than 20 households in Fenghuang Village that were burned down by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were rebuilt in less than ten days by the farmers' association mobilizing and organizing the masses. The school building of Keyi Village Central Primary School was renovated by the entire village, men and women, in just a few days. Many villages have set up literacy classes, and women are busy working in the fields during the day, and at night they are busy going to literacy classes to study and learn to read.

    The Axi women are most happy that in the past they were not addressed by their own names, but were addressed by the names of their brothers or husbands. In order to cherish this independent symbol of their name, some girls wrote down the names their teachers gave them and posted them in their houses. On March 15th of this year, the All-West Mountain District Democratic Women's Federation was established. The women representatives from various townships dressed up as if they were celebrating a festival to celebrate their extraordinary day. They walked in order to the statue of the people's leader Chairman Mao and bowed, and spoke in front of everyone. Bi Shi of Keyi Village said: "We understand in our hearts that only by quickly handing over public grain and letting our comrades of the People's Liberation Army eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's troops and recover Taiwan and Tibet can we Axi people on West Mountain live in peace forever." Another woman representative said: "In the past, we were oppressed. Today is different. We can speak up about big and small things. This is all given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." These profound thoughts and words were not spoken by others, but by Axi women living in the deep mountains who could not read a single word. This is such a difficult thing!

　　《毛主席和我们阿西濮人民在一起》
    展潮
    三月树出芽，
    天地间突然发亮光，
    出了一个毛泽东；
    蜂子的毒刺虽还留在人身上，
    可恨的反动政府已被推翻了，
    西山上的阿西人日子好过啦！
    在我们古老的山区里，
    咯咯的笑声响遍四方………
    逗人的三弦琴应和着啡哩哩的笛子弹奏起来了。胜利后的西山，到处充满着欢乐的声音。年老的阿阿（大爹）和阿嬷阿（大妈）可以在自己屋子里安逸的睡觉了。年青的阿木（大哥）和阿美哩若（大姐娘）打田里耕作回来，又可以在一起玩乐了。“这都是毛主席给我们的好处。”一位年老的阿西濮斩钉截铁地这样说。她一生的经历告诉她，除了共产党毛主席以外，没有人想到要使阿西濮人从痛苦的深渊里爬起来。
    阿西濮人是彝族中的一个支系，在许多年代以前，他们被反动统治者驱逐得到处流浪，最后才定居在云南弥勒县西的深山峻岭中。阿西濮人的先辈们用自己的双手辛勤地劳作，终于在石头山的缝隙间，开垦出一小块一小块的耕地，在上面播种着他们从西北带来的玉麦（玉蜀黍）和豆类。他们是这样艰辛地立住脚跟，繁子育孙，逐渐遍布了整个西山。他们现在共有两万多人。其中的长者，还模糊地记得他们的村寨是怎样创建起来的。七十八岁的刘映奎的爸爸说：“我小的时候，这个村子还是丛树密布的荒山。”他指点着我住的那间房子说：“这里原来是一个山洞，里边睡着一条蟒蛇。”纯朴而勤勉的阿西濮人，就是在和毒蛇猛兽奋战中把西山开拓出来的。
    他们把高低不平满布石头的西山，辛苦经营，但仍终年得不到温饱。就是这样，那些大汉族主义的反动统治者还不放松他们。在反动的满清政府统治时代，有些土豪劣绅开始把他们的势力伸上西山，强行霸占阿西濮人的土地，随着又把苛捐杂税加到他们头上。到国民党匪帮统治时代，对阿西濮人的榨取更加厉害，在要粮、要税、抓丁以外，蒋匪军更三五成群地扛着枪杆上西山去牵猪宰羊。谁反抗谁就被抓去。就在这个时候，法国帝国主义的魔手沿着滇越路伸到西山。他们修筑教堂、开办学校，实施帝国主义的文化侵略。
    勇敢的阿西濮人为着他们的自由解放曾进行了英勇的斗争。当他们在弥勒和昆明读书的阿西濮青年，经过一九四五年的“一二·一”民主运动，受到了进步思想的洗礼后，开始认识了共产党，并有人加入了中国共产党。这批先进的阿西濮人在中国共产党滇、桂、黔边区党委会的领导与帮助下，在一九四七年冬天建立了第一支阿西濮人民武装，和国民党匪帮展开了英勇的武装斗争。阿西濮和圭山的撒尼、苗族、摆夷以及汉族的人民紧密团结在一起，粉碎了蒋匪军多次的扫荡。到今年春天在入滇的人民解放军的帮助下，最后肃清了蒋匪军。西山就获得了完全的解放。
    蒋匪军曾在西山进行了残酷的烧杀抢劫，阿西濮人的房子大半都被蒋匪军烧毁了，麦冲村的三十二户中就有二十九户人家的房屋被烧掉了。但阿西濮人是坚强的，他们没有房子住，就搬到山顶上，在树林里搭起棚子来。男的参加民兵游击队，女的操持家务，情况紧急的时候，把东西埋藏起来，宁愿让粮食霉烂了，也不叫蒋匪军抢走半粒。艰苦的斗争，终于得到了胜利。
    解放后西山的情况完全不同了。油乍地村有一位六十二岁的老英雄黄振兴在讲述了打游击的故事后，兴奋地对我说：“共产党‘扎华罗’（好极啦）！给汉人老百姓做好事，也给阿西濮人做好事。过去赶街子汉人看见阿西濮人都叫‘罗罗’，现在再不这样叫啦！过去汉人用脚踢着阿西濮人的米袋问价钱，现在面对面商量事情了。阿西濮人和汉人平等，都是因为有了共产党毛主席的领导。”老阿西濮还告诉我一件令他十分感动的事。有一次，村子里农民协会通知他去开会，讨论互助变工，因为他病了没有去，待他病好了，上地一瞧，地里的活别人已经替他做得一干二净了。
    阿西濮人现在正积极地修建家园。凤凰村被蒋匪烧掉的二十多户人家的房子，由农会发动组织群众，不到十天都重新盖起来了。可邑村中心小学的校舍，经全村男女一齐动手，没有几天便修饰好了。有好多村子，都办了识字班，妇女们白天在地里劳碌，夜里还忙着到识字班读书识字。
    阿西濮妇女们最感到高兴的，她们过去不是随哥哥弟弟称呼，便是随着丈夫称呼。她们为着珍爱这个独立标志的名字，有的姑娘把先生替自己起的名字写下来贴在自己屋子里。今年三月十五日，全西山区民主妇女联合会成立了，各乡的妇女代表们像过节似地打扮着，来庆祝她们这个不平凡的日子，她们顺序地走到人民领袖毛主席像的前面鞠躬，在大家面前讲话。可邑村的毕石说：“我们心里明白，只有快缴公粮，让我们的解放军同志把蒋匪军消灭，收回台湾和西藏，我们西山上的阿西濮人才能永远过太平年。”另一个妇女代表说：“过去我们受压迫，今天不同了，大事小事我们都能说话，这都是共产党和毛主席给我们的。”这些深刻的思想和话语不是出自别人，而是由住在深山峻岭中一字不识的阿西濮妇女们说出来，这是多么不容易的事情啊！
