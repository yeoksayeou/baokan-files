The Development of the People's Guerrilla Forces in Southern Korea
    Translated by Zhao Zheng

    On August 15, 1945, the heroic Soviet Red Army liberated Korea. The Korean people, who had been cruelly oppressed by Japanese imperialism for 36 years, immediately launched a fervent democratic movement.

    However, the democratic movement of the people in southern Korea was met with frantic suppression by American imperialism and its running dog, Syngman Rhee. The resistance of the Korean people accordingly grew increasingly high. The famous "October People's Resistance" occurred in 1946, engulfing the entire region of South Korea. From September 23rd to November 11th, workers' strikes, peasant uprisings, student strikes, and civil servants' work stoppages took place, involving 2,279,338 people. The "February 7th National Salvation Struggle" of 1948 was a large-scale uprising by the people of southern Korea against American imperialism and its running dogs. Unfortunately, both of these heroic people's resistances were cruelly suppressed by the United States and its running dogs.

    Through these two struggles, the people of southern Korea realized that fighting against American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, and striving for democracy and the right to live through peaceful means, were met with brutal massacres, imprisonment, and exile. Only armed struggle could achieve true national independence and freedom.

    On May 10, 1948, a sham "election" was held in South Korea, manipulated by the "United Nations Commission on Korea." The people of South Korea launched strikes, market closures, and school boycotts to oppose the sham "election." Prior to this, the people of Jeju Island had launched an armed uprising on April 3rd. This uprising, like a lighthouse guiding the way, showed the people of the South that there was only one path to overthrowing the traitors and striving for national independence and freedom: to arm themselves and oppose the armed counter-revolution.

    The armed people of Jeju Island attacked fifteen police stations, inflicting serious blows on the reactionaries, and then entered Mount Halla to organize the people and expand the liberated areas.

    On October 20, 1948, the puppet defense forces stationed in Yeosu revolted, joining with the local people to strike at the evil landlords and severely damage the puppet army and police, and began to restore the People's Committee. In order to eliminate this people's armed force, the American imperialists sent warships to bombard the city of Yeosu, forcing the people's armed forces to move into the Jiri Mountains. This force was not only not eliminated by the American imperialists, but became even stronger and more developed, formally forming the People's Guerrilla Force, which, together with the People's Guerrilla Force in the Halla Mountain area of Jeju Island, ignited the flames of the people's guerrilla war in South Korea.

    1948 marked a new stage in the struggle of the people of southern Korea. Since then, the people's guerrilla war has been developing in vast areas of the South. With the enthusiastic support of the people, the People's Guerrilla Force has grown stronger day by day. The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique have launched many "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. In fighting against the People's Guerrilla Force, they massacred large numbers of people and plundered people's property through forced conscription, but all the evil plans of the United States and the South Korean puppet government failed one after another.

    The People's Guerrilla Force developed rapidly in Jeju Island and the Jiri Mountains. Later, in the Taebaek Mountains, the Yeongnam area, and the Honam area, the activities of the People's Guerrilla Force gradually expanded. From April to December of last year, the number of People's Guerrilla Force mobilized increased from 16,000 to 120,000, an increase of seven and a half times; there were 482 battles in April and 1,260 battles in December; 716 enemies were annihilated in April and 2,768 enemies were annihilated in November. In October last year, the People's Guerrilla Force attacked and destroyed 45 puppet district governments in South Korea; in November, 22 peasant uprisings and 24 mass struggles were launched. According to statistics on August 10, 1949, the scope of activities of the People's Guerrilla Force included vast areas of South Korea, encompassing seven cities, 118 counties, and 682 districts. The people of South Korea widely supported the struggle of the People's Guerrilla Force. According to incomplete statistics, the people of a certain area in South Korea supported the People's Guerrilla Force with 12,900 dou of soybeans in December of last year, and 45,000 dou this year; and this was carried out under the Syngman Rhee puppet government's frantic martial law order that "people are not allowed to leave the village by one hundred meters."

    The raging people's guerrilla war in South Korea has seriously shaken the foundation of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's reactionary regime. Last winter, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang launched two frantic "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the People's Guerrilla Force. Because Korea did not have large mountains to rely on, the People's Guerrilla Force entered the rural masses, closely integrated with the people, and stubbornly persisted in the struggle.

    On June 25th, the Syngman Rhee puppet army, under the instigation of the United States, launched a civil war. The people's guerrilla forces in the South immediately took active measures, cutting off enemy transportation everywhere, flanking the enemy army, and intercepting the routed enemy, paralyzing the rear institutions of the US-Rhee bandit army, while conducting propaganda and mobilization, organizing the people, expanding the liberated areas, and cooperating with the People's Army in combat.

　　朝鲜南部人民游击队的发展
    赵正译
    一九四五年八月十五日，英勇的苏联红军解放了朝鲜。在日本帝国主义残酷压榨下达三十六年之久的朝鲜人民，随即展开了热烈的民主运动。
    但是，朝鲜南部人民的民主运动却遭到美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚疯狂的镇压。朝鲜人民的反抗也就随之日趋高涨。有名的“十月人民抗争”发生在一九四六年，南朝鲜全部地区都卷入了这一抗争，自九月二十三日起至十一月十一日为止的期间，工人罢工、农民暴动、学生罢课、公务人员停止工作，参加人数达二百二十七万九千三百三十八人。一九四八年的“二七救国斗争”是朝鲜南部人民大规模反对美帝及其走狗的暴动。不幸，这两次英勇的人民抗争都被美国及其走狗残酷地镇压下去了。
    经过了这两次斗争，朝鲜南部人民认识到和美帝国主义及李承晚卖国集团作斗争，用和平的方法争取民主及生活的权利，从而得到的回答是残酷的屠杀、监禁和放逐，只有武装斗争才能得到真正的民族独立和自由。
    一九四八年五月十日南朝鲜举行伪“选举”，这是“联合国朝鲜委员会”所操纵的，南朝鲜人民纷纷罢工、罢市、罢课，展开反对伪“选举”的斗争。在这以前，济州岛人民曾于四月三日举行武装暴动，这一暴动，犹如指引航路的灯塔，使南部人民看到：要打倒卖国贼争取民族独立自由，只有一条路可走，就是武装起来，反对武装的反革命。
    武装的济州岛人民袭击了十五个警察署，给予反动派以严重的打击，便进入汉拿山，组织人民，扩大解放区。
    一九四八年十月二十日，驻在丽水的伪国防军起义，与当地人民结合一起，打击恶霸地主，重创伪军警，开始恢复人民委员会。美国帝国主义者为了要消灭这支人民武装，当时曾派军舰炮轰丽水城，迫使人民武装进入智异山活动。这支队伍不仅未被美国帝国主义者消灭，反而更加壮大发展，正式成立了人民游击队，和济州岛汉拿山区的人民游击队一起，燃起了南朝鲜人民游击战争的火焰。
    一九四八年标志着朝鲜南部人民斗争的新阶段。自此以后，人民游击战争即在南部广大地区发展着。由于人民的热烈支援，人民游击队日渐壮大起来。美国和李承晚集团曾经发动了许多次“围剿”“讨伐”。在与人民游击队作战中，他们大批的屠杀人民，并用强迫征收的方式掠夺人民财产，但是美国与南朝鲜傀儡政府的一切罪恶计划一个接连一个的失败了。
    人民游击队在济州岛和智异山区迅速发展着，此后，在太白山区、岭南区和湖南地区，人民游击队的活动也逐渐扩大。从去年四月到十二月，人民游击队动员数从一万六千人发展到十二万人，增加了七倍半；在四月战斗四八二次，在十二月战斗一二六○次；在四月歼灭敌人七一六名，在十一月歼灭敌人二七六八名。去年十月，人民游击队在南朝鲜袭击并破坏了四十五个伪区政府；十一月，发动了二十二次农民暴动，二十四次群众斗争。据一九四九年八月十日的统计，人民游击队活动的范围，包括南朝鲜的七个市、一百一十八个县和六百八十二个区的广大地区。南朝鲜人民广泛地支持人民游击队的斗争。据不完全统计，南朝鲜某地区人民在去年十二月支援人民游击队的食粮，即达一万二千九百斗大豆，今年已有四万五千斗；而且这还是在李承晚傀儡政府“不准人民离开村庄一百公尺”的疯狂的戒严令下进行的。
    如火燎原的南朝鲜人民游击战争，严重地动摇了李承晚匪帮反动政权的基础。去年冬天，李承晚匪帮曾对人民游击队进行两次疯狂的“围剿”，因为朝鲜没有大山可以凭借，人民游击队就进入农村的人民群众中，与人民密切结合，顽强地坚持着斗争。
    六月二十五日，李承晚伪军在美国指使下发动内战，南部人民游击队即积极活动，到处切断敌军交通，侧击敌军并截击溃敌，使美李匪军的后方机构陷于瘫痪，一面进行宣传鼓动，组织人民，扩大解放区，配合人民军作战。
