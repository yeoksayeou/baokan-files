　　Rapid Development of Health Services in Northeast China
    Medical Personnel and Beds in Factories and Mines Double in Half a Year; Over Ten Thousand Midwives Trained, Infant Mortality Rate Greatly Reduced.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The health services in the Northeast region have seen significant development in the past six months. Firstly, the region has focused on health work in factories and mines. According to recent statistics, in just half a year, enterprises directly under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government have added 31 health clinics, 2 hospitals, and 20 midwifery stations. The number of health workers has also increased from 2,235 in December of last year to 4,411. On average, there is one health worker for every 100 workers and one doctor for every 457 workers. Currently, state-owned enterprises have 245 health clinics, 20 hospitals, and 2 sanatoriums, with a total of 3,091 beds, more than double the number in December of last year. There has also been a substantial increase in the supply of medicines and medical equipment. Welfare facilities, labor protection, and safety equipment in factories and mines have also been further improved. A major safety inspection was conducted in April, and over 80% of the problems discovered in labor protection, safety equipment, and health welfare have been resolved. At the same time, an industrial and mining hygiene experimental zone was established in Anshan this year, and hygiene experimental factories were established in Shenyang Smelting Plant and Northeast No. 4 Textile Factory, in order to accumulate experience for further development of industrial and mining hygiene work in the future. In terms of epidemic prevention, the vaccination rate in various factories and mines this spring reached over 60% to 80%; in Dalian, factories reached 80% to 90%.
    In rural areas, 42 health experimental counties have been established this year out of more than 180 counties in Northeast China. Each experimental county has established a county-level health院(yuan, institute/hospital), and 130 district-level health所(suo, station/clinic) have been established. Basic organizations for health and epidemic prevention are also gradually being established. Each province has begun to improve maternal and child health care in a planned way. For example, Songjiang Province has trained more than 600 midwives this year. More than 12,300 old-style midwives have been retrained in various provinces. These new and retrained midwives have initially learned scientific midwifery and some hygiene knowledge. As a result, the infant mortality rate in vast rural areas has dropped from 60% to 70% in the past to 20% to 40%. In addition, studies have been conducted on endemic diseases such as goiter, Kashin-Beck disease, and Keshan disease in various regions in the past six months, and some experience in prevention and treatment has been gained.
    In terms of urban hygiene work, 11 hygiene experimental zones have been established in Northeast China. In addition to establishing district health clinics in the zones, health clinics have also been established in each central street. Some cities have also assigned responsibility areas to physicians. Private doctors who practice privately are also gradually being organized, and medical and pharmaceutical joint organizations are being widely established. The average number of people vaccinated in various cities this year accounted for 80% of the total population. Cleaning, industrial hygiene management, school hygiene, and maternal and child health care in cities are also gradually improving. Shenyang has also organized private midwives in eight districts to establish maternal and child health care stations.
    In addition, the Northeast region has also paid attention to hygiene work on transportation lines. The railway line from Manzhouli to Shanhaiguan has been designated as a health experimental line. Quarantine stations and first-aid stations have been generally established at stations along the line; infectious disease isolation stations have been established in Siping and Changping. Trains running more than 400 kilometers are specially equipped with two health and epidemic prevention workers to serve passengers. In addition, passenger trains have generally added separate carriages for children and non-smoking carriages; waiting rooms for mothers and children and ticket gates for women, the sick, the elderly, and the disabled have been added to stations of third class or higher.
            Some County and Banner Cadres Urgently Need to Overcome Complacency in Plague Prevention Work
    Currently, the Northeast region is carrying out summer epidemic prevention work, especially to prevent the resurgence of plague. However, most county and banner cadres and some epidemic prevention personnel in plague-stricken areas still have complacency and a fluke mentality towards plague prevention and control, neglecting prevention work. This year, the entire Northeast plans to catch 30 million rats, but the number completed in half a year is less than one-tenth; preventive vaccinations have also only reached half of the population that should be vaccinated; environmental hygiene is still very poor. Dead rats and carrier rats have been found in some areas. The Health Department of the Northeast People's Government has repeatedly called on all localities to pay close attention to epidemic prevention work to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction. In the second half of this year, the health work in the Northeast region will continue to follow the general guideline of "prevention first, medical treatment as a supplement," rapidly organize health worker associations at all levels, unite medical workers from all fields to serve the people, widely establish basic health organizations below the county and district levels, and carry out public-private cooperative health undertakings, and continue to train medical personnel.

　　东北卫生事业迅速发展
    半年来工矿中的医务人员与病床增加一倍，并训练了万余接产妇，婴儿死亡率大降。
    【本报讯】半年来东北地区的卫生事业有显著的发展。首先，该区注意了工矿中的卫生工作。据最近统计，半年中仅东北人民政府工业部所属各企业中就增设了三十一个卫生所，两处医院和二十个助产站。卫生工作人员亦由去年十二月的二千二百三十五人增至四千四百十一人。平均约一百名工人有了一名卫生工作人员，四百五十七个工人有了一名医生为他们服务。目前各国营企业中已有卫生所二百四十五个，医院二十个，疗养院两所，共有床位三千零九十一张，较去年十二月增加一倍强。药品与医疗设备亦有大量的补充。各厂矿的福利设施、劳动保护和安全设备也得到了进一步的改善。本年四月曾举行保安大检查，检查中所发现的劳动保护、安全设备、卫生福利等方面的问题，百分之八十以上都得到了解决。同时，今年在鞍山建立了工矿卫生实验区，在沈阳冶炼厂、东北第四纺织厂建立了卫生试验厂，以便为今后进一步开展工矿卫生工作积累经验。在防疫方面，今春各工矿种痘人数达到了百分之六十至八十以上；大连市各工厂达到了百分之八十至九十。
    在农村，全东北一百八十余县中今年已试办了四十二个卫生实验县。各实验县均设立了县属卫生院，并成立了一百三十个区卫生所。卫生防疫的基层组织亦逐渐建立。各省均有计划地开始改进妇婴保健工作；如松江省本年培养了六百余名助产士。各省经过改造的旧接产妇已达一万二千三百余名。这些新旧接产人员都初步学会了科学接生，懂得了一些卫生知识。因此，广大农村中婴儿的死亡率已由过去的百分之六十至七十降至百分之二十至四十。此外，半年来并对各地的甲状腺肿、大骨节、克山病等地方病进行了调查研究，获得了一些预防、治疗的经验。
    在城市卫生工作方面，全东北设立了十一个卫生实验区，在区内除设立区卫生所外，各中心街亦建立了卫生所，有的城市还给医师划立了责任区。开业的私医也逐渐组织起来，广泛建立医药联合组织。本年度各城市种痘人数平均占总人口的百分之八十。城市中的清洁、行业卫生管理、学校卫生、妇婴保健等工作亦逐渐改善。沈阳市并在八个区内，组织开业助产士，普遍建立了妇婴保健站。
    另外，东北区还注意了交通线上的卫生工作。满州里到山海关一条铁路已划为卫生实验线。沿线各车站普遍建立了检疫所和急救站；四平、长平并设立了传染病隔离所。四百公里以上的运行列车，均专设两名卫生防疫工作者为旅客服务。此外，旅客列车普遍增设了携带儿童单独车厢与不吸烟车厢；三等以上车站均增设了母子候车室与妇、病、老、残检票口。
            部分县旗干部亟应克服对预防鼠疫工作上的麻痹思想
    目前，东北区正进行夏季防疫工作，特别是预防鼠疫的再起。但鼠疫地区多数县、旗干部及某些防疫人员，对防治鼠疫工作仍有麻痹思想和侥幸心理，忽视预防工作。今年全东北计划捕鼠三千万头，在半年中完成数目尚不及十分之一；预防注射也仅及应注射人口的半数；环境卫生还很差。有的地区已发现死鼠和保菌鼠。东北人民政府卫生部已一再号召各地切实注意防疫工作，以保证经济建设的顺利进行。今年下半年，东北区的卫生工作仍将根据“预防为主、医疗为辅”的总方针，迅速组织各级卫生工作者协会，团结各方面医务工作者为人民服务；并广泛建立县、区以下的卫生基层组织；同时开展公私合作的卫生合作事业，并继续培养医务人材。
