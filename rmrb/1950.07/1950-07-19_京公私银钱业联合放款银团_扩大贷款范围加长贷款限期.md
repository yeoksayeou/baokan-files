Beijing Public-Private Bank Money Industry Joint Lending Syndicate Expands Loan Scope and Extends Loan Term

[Beijing Municipal News Agency] Under the leadership of the People's Bank of China's Beijing Branch, the Beijing Public-Private Bank Money Industry Joint Lending Syndicate has decided to expand its lending scope and relax lending standards. When the syndicate was established on May 1st, it stipulated a total loan amount of 3 billion yuan, with plans to lend 1.5 billion yuan before May 15th in the first phase. However, as of July 11th, over two months later, only 33 loans totaling 750 million yuan had been issued, and five of these had already matured and been repaid, leaving a total loan balance of only 570 million yuan. In order to review and improve its operations, the syndicate convened a general meeting of all participating banks and money shops on the 12th of this month. At the meeting, Pan Yuyan, chairman of the syndicate's standing committee, first reported on the work of the past two months and reviewed the reasons why the business had not been well developed, mainly due to insufficient understanding of the current new economic situation and the loan regulations being too strict, not suitable for the specific conditions of Beijing's industry and commerce, resulting in a lack of initiative. All the representatives of the participating banks and money shops agreed with Pan Yuyan's review. The representative of the People's Bank of China's Beijing Branch participating in the syndicate's work not only reviewed the insufficient leadership of the state bank at the meeting, but also pointed out that the future direction of development must be to strive to support legitimate industry and commerce and actively develop business. The meeting finally decided to revise the loan methods, expand the loan scope, and include commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and promotes the exchange of goods between domestic and foreign cities and villages as an important target. Loans were originally limited to mortgage loans, but now it is revised to be based on mortgages in principle; credit loans can be granted to those with reliable credit and substantial shop guarantees. The loan term has also been extended compared to before. The original maximum term of two months has now been changed to a maximum of three months for commerce and a maximum of six months for industry. The original stipulation that loan applications should be investigated by the Federation of Industry and Commerce before being introduced to the syndicate has now been changed to applying to both the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the syndicate at the same time, with both parties investigating simultaneously to avoid delays. The meeting also decided to increase the total loan amount to meet the needs after the development of business. The specific increase will be discussed by the syndicate's standing committee.

　　京公私银钱业联合放款银团
    扩大贷款范围加长贷款限期
    【京市新闻处讯】京市公私营银钱业联合贷款银团，在人民银行北京分行领导下，决定扩大贷款范围，放宽贷款尺度。该银团于五月一日成立时，曾规定贷款总额暂为三十亿元，计划第一期五月十五日以前贷出十五亿元，结果到七月十一日止两个多月来仅贷出三十三笔共七亿五千余万元，其中还有五笔已到期归还，故贷款总余额只五亿七千余万元。该团为检讨和改进业务，在本月十二日召集参加联合放款的行庄举行全体大会。会上首由银团常委会主委潘禹言报告了两个多月的工作，并检讨了业务没能很好开展的原因，主要是对当前经济新情势仍认识不足，贷款章程规定太严格，不适合北京工商业具体情况，因此主动性不够。与会各行庄代表一致同意潘禹言的检讨。人民银行北京分行参加银团工作的代表在会上除检讨国家银行的领导不够外，并指出今后发展方向，必须努力扶植正当工商业，力求主动开展业务。会议最后决定修改贷款办法，扩大贷款范围，把有利于国计民生，促进内外城乡物资交流的商业也列为重要对象。贷款原来以承做抵押为限，现修正为以有抵押为原则；凡信用可靠有殷实铺保的可办信贷。贷款期限也较前加长，原规定最多两个月，现改为商业最长三个月，工业最长六个月。申请贷款原规定先经工商联合会调查后再介绍到银团，现改为同时向工商联合会和银团申请，双方同时调查以免延宕时间。会上并决定增多贷款总额，以适应业务开展后的需要，增加的具体数字交银团常委会讨论。
