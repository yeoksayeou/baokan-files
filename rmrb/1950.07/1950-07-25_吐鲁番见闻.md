What I Saw in Turpan
    Zeng Gang
    "Fire State"
    Turpan is located on the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, in a very deep basin (it takes a full day for a car to crawl from Dihua to Turpan). The center of the basin is actually 283 meters below sea level, so the climate is very hot. When the snow on the roads of Dihua City has not yet completely melted, it is already springtime here.

    In the summer, as soon as the sun rises, Turpan is completely trapped in a fiery pit. People simply cannot live on the ground. Therefore, every courtyard has a large sunshade, and every courtyard has a "basement" (a very small earthen cellar). During the day, after the sun comes out, people hide in the basement to rest and work, and only climb to the ground after the sun goes down. This kind of life lasts for two or three months every year, so people call it the "Fire State."

    Rain and "Karez"
    The "Fire State" has no snow or rain all year round, and the climate is very dry. The county has more than 20,000 people who rarely engage in animal husbandry and rely entirely on agriculture to live. Without rain, people wait for the snow at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains (the snow on the mountains does not melt all year round) to melt and divert the snow water to irrigate the farmland. Because the weather is too hot and there is no rain, people are afraid that this precious snow water will evaporate when they divert it to irrigate the fields. So, they build a kind of dark channel, with wooden boards and withered grass underneath. They also dig a pit at a short distance so that they can repair it at any time if the channel fails. Anyone who has been to Turpan will see countless small pits dug in a large area of ​​the Gobi Desert, one after another. This is called "Karez."

    This is a considerable and huge project, and construction is very difficult. Therefore, in the Turpan area, farmers are very concerned about the issue of water -- the "Karez."

    Two Famous Products
    "Turpan grapes and Hami melons, the girls of Kuche are like flowers." -- Xinjiang folk saying.

    The grapes produced here are second to none. There is a ditch called "Grape Valley" in the suburbs of Turpan. The ditch is full of countless grapes, even more than our inland wild sour dates! There are many kinds of grapes here. The largest is as big as a thumb. The best is the seedless white grape, which is not only fragrant and delicious but also very clean (because there are no flies here), which is much better than American grapes. It is now sold throughout the country and the Soviet Central Asian region.

    Cotton is also a famous product here, with large cotton bolls and good quality, which is famous throughout Xinjiang.

### 吐鲁番见闻

　　吐鲁番见闻
    曾刚
    “火州”
    吐鲁番地处天山南麓，是一块很深的盆地（从迪化到吐鲁番，汽车要整整的爬行一天）。盆地中央竟低于海平面二八三公尺，因此，气候很热，迪化市马路上的积雪还没有溶解完的时候，这里已是阳春天气了。
    夏天，太阳只一露头，吐鲁番就完全陷在火炕里了，人们简直就无法在地面上生活，因之，每一个院子都搭有一块遮阳大席棚，而且每一个院子都修得有“地下室”（一种很小的土窖子）。白天，太阳出来以后，人们都躲在地下室去休息、工作，等到太阳下去以后，才一个一个爬到地面上来。这样的日子，每年有两三个月，所以，人们把它叫做“火州”。
    雨水与“坎尔井”
    “火州”终年既不下雪也无点滴雨水，气候非常干燥。全县两万多人很少从事牧畜，全靠农业来生活，没有雨水，人们就等天山脚下（山上的雪是终年不化的）的积雪溶解以后，将雪水引到农田来灌溉。由于天气太热，又无雨水，人们引雪水浇田的时候，就生怕这宝贵的雪水被蒸发掉，而修成一种暗水渠，底下还要垫上木板和枯草，在相距不远的地方挖上一个土坑，一旦水渠发生了故障，就可以随时检修。到过吐鲁番的人，谁都会看到一大片的戈壁滩上，挖得有无数的小坑，一个接一个，这就叫做“坎尔井”。
    这是一个相当巨大的工程，修建非常困难，因之，吐鲁番一带，农民对于水——“坎尔井”的问题是很关切的。
    两样名产
    “吐鲁番葡萄哈密瓜，库车的杨岗子（女人）一朵花。”——新疆民谚。
    这地方，出产葡萄要算是首屈一指了。吐鲁番城郊有一条沟名“葡萄沟”，沟里丛生着无数的葡萄，比我们内地的野酸枣，还要多呢！这里葡萄的样子很多，最大的有大拇指头那么大，最好的要算无核的白葡萄，不但吃起来清香可口，而且非常清洁（因为此地无苍蝇），比美国的葡萄好得多，现在销行全国和苏属中亚细亚一带。
    棉花也是此地的名产，棉桃大，质量好，全疆驰名。
