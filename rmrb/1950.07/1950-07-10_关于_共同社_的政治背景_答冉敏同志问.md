　　On the Political Background of "Kyodo News"
    In response to Comrade Ran Min's question:
    "Kyodo News" is a Japanese news agency. Its predecessor was the notorious "Domei News Agency." Now it is jointly run by conservative Japanese newspapers such as the "Asahi Shimbun," "Mainichi Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun." On the surface, it is "privately owned," but in reality, it is a propaganda tool manipulated by the Yoshida government. It serves the interests of the American and Japanese monopoly capitalist groups.

　　关于“共同社”的政治背景
    答冉敏同志问冉敏同志：
    “共同社”是日本的通讯社。它的前身是臭名远扬的“同盟社”。现在它是由《朝日新闻》、《每日新闻》和《读卖新闻》这些日本保守报纸合办的，在表面上是“民营”，其实是为吉田政府所操纵的宣传工具。它是为美、日垄断资本集团服务的。
