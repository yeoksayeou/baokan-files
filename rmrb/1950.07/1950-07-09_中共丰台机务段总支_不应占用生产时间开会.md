Reader's Opinion

　　To the Editorial Department:
    I have the following opinion regarding the General Branch of the CPC Fengtai Locomotive Depot: Recently, our production has been very tight, but the General Branch often occupies production time to hold various meetings. Moreover, the meetings often drag on for a long time, sometimes lasting half a day. When those of us who don't leave production go to the meetings, our production tasks have to be shared by others. This can easily disrupt the production plan, affecting production and causing dissatisfaction among the workers, alienating the Party from the masses. In the past, higher authorities had instructed us to understand the situation by going deep into the field as much as possible, instead of relying solely on summoning subordinates to report. Therefore, we hope that the higher authorities can frequently go to the field to understand the situation and help solve problems, and unless absolutely necessary, do not casually occupy production time to hold meetings. We also hope that the General Branch can regularly prepare all necessary materials related to the situation of the lower levels, and not wait until the higher authorities need them to temporarily hold meetings to collect them. Furthermore, when convening meetings, the reports should not be repetitive. Those who have already reported the situation and have no new information to report, if there is nothing else for them to do, need not be called again, so as to avoid wasting time. For example, on the evening of June 13th, the General Branch Committee members came to the depot to convene a branch committee meeting to understand the situation, and on the morning of June 15th, they convened the branch committee members to the General Branch for a meeting. I think one of these two meetings could have been omitted or merged.

### 中共丰台机务段总支  不应占用生产时间开会

专栏：读者意见

　　中共丰台机务段总支
    不应占用生产时间开会编辑同志：
    我对丰台机务段总支有这样一个意见：最近我们生产很紧张，可是总支常常占用生产时间召开各种会议。而且会议时间常常拖得久，有时一开就是半天，像我们这些不脱离生产的人一去开会，自己的生产任务就得分担在别人身上。这样就很容易打乱了生产计划，既要影响生产，又要引起职工群众的不满，使党脱离了群众。本来过去上级曾有过指示，了解情况，应尽量深入现场，不应只靠召集下级汇报。因此，我们希望上级能经常到现场了解情况并帮助解决问题，除非不得已，不要随便占用生产时间来开会。我们并希望总支能经常准备有关下级情况的各种必要材料，不要等到上级需要时再临时开会搜集。还有，在召集开会时，情况汇报不应重复，已经汇报过情况而又没新情况汇报的人，如无其他事情就不必再找他去，免得浪费时间。比如，六月十三号晚总支委员到本段召集支委开会，了解情况，十五号早上又召集支委到总支去开会。这两次会我觉得是可以省去一次或合并举行的。
