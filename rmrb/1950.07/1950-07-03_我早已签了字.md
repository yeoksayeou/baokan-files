　　I Already Signed
　　He Sijing

　　Striving for world peace is the noblest righteous act and undertaking. I already signed the declaration. Illegally stealing the fruits of scientific inventions is already unlawful, and turning them into bombs to massacre humanity and using them to threaten human life is blatant criminality. The just cause of world peace can only be achieved by uniting the vast majority of humanity to stop the criminal activities of the Wall Street criminal den.

    为世界和平而奋斗，是最崇高的正义的行为与事业。我早已在宣言上签了字。私窃科学发明的成果，已经是不法，还要把它弄成屠杀人类的炸弹并用以威胁人类的生命，这是公然的罪犯。世界和平的正义事业只有团结人类最大多数来制止华尔街犯罪巢窟的犯罪活动。
