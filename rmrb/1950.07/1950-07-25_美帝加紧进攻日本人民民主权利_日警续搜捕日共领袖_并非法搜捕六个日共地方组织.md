　　U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Attacks on the Democratic Rights of the Japanese People
    Japanese Police Continue to Hunt Down Japanese Communist Party Leaders
    Illegally Raiding Six Local Organizations of the Japanese Communist Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch] According to TASS dispatch on the 23rd: Tokyo news indicates that the search for Tokuda Kyuichi and eight other leaders of the Japanese Communist Party is still ongoing. The Special Investigation Bureau, the National Rural Police Headquarters, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department have formed nine special investigation teams.
    Democratic figures in Tokyo pointed out that the police adopted high-handed measures in this so-called "search" incident. Detectives detained people resembling leaders of the Japanese Communist Party and subjected them to interrogation. Armed police rushed into private residences, conducting searches and damaging property.
    Another dispatch: Japanese police raided six Japanese Communist Party organizations in the Kinki region and seized the newspapers issued by these organizations.
    Note: In order to further persecute the Japanese Communist Party and its leaders, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, under the pretext that Tokuda Kyuichi, Nosaka Sanzo, Ito Ritsu, and other nine Japanese Communist Party Central Committee members who were illegally "purged" had "unknown addresses," mobilized police and special agents from the Ministry of Justice's Special Investigation Bureau to search for these nine people throughout the country in early July. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department also convened a meeting of all police chiefs within its jurisdiction on the 17th to formulate a "search strategy" (Associated Press) and intensify the atrocities of the search.

　　美帝加紧进攻日本人民民主权利
    日警续搜捕日共领袖
    并非法搜捕六个日共地方组织
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社二十三日讯：东京消息表明，对德田球一和其他八名日本共产党领袖的搜捕，仍在继续进行中。特别审查局和国家地方警察本部及东京警察局，已组成了九支特别搜查队。
    东京的民主人士指出：在这个所谓“搜查”事件中，警察采取了高压手段。警探把貌似日本共产党领袖的人拘留起来，并横加审问。武装的警察冲进私人住宅，进行搜查，破坏房屋。
    又讯：日本警察搜捕了近畿地方的六个日本共产党组织，并查封了这些组织所发行的报纸。
    按：美、日反动派为进一步迫害日共及其领袖，于七月初借口被非法“整肃”的日共中央委员德田球一、野坂参三及伊藤律等九人“住址不明”，出动了警察及法务府特别审查局的特务，在全国范围内对该九人进行搜捕。东京警察局并曾于十七日召集辖区内所有警察局长举行会议，拟订一个“搜查战略”（美联社），加紧进行搜捕暴行。
