　　Convey the Determination of Chinese Students to Defend Peace to Students All Over the World
　　— Interview with the Delegation of Students Studying Abroad
　　By our reporter Jin Feng

　　Chinese students, with a thirty-year tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, who have begun to live happy lives after the imperialists were driven out of mainland China, feel utter indignation at the criminal acts of American imperialism in armed aggression against Korea, Taiwan, and other countries; and they have deep concern and sympathy for the students of Korea, Japan, and other countries who are fighting against American imperialism. The Chinese student delegation attending the Second World Student Congress concentrated on expressing the emotions and will of Chinese students.

　　"Imperialist aggression means a large number of young people unemployed, out of school, and subjected to arrest and slaughter by secret agents and military police"; Ke Zaishuo, Secretary-General of the All-China Student Federation—a student who in the past was blacklisted in the Kuomintang-ruled areas and forced into exile—said angrily: "Chinese students are very familiar with American imperialism. In Beijing, American soldiers raped female students at our school." "However, students all over the country stood up and shouted for the American army to get out of China! The People's Liberation Army fought over, and the American army eventually rolled out of mainland China. Now it is still wreaking havoc in Korea and Taiwan, but we must liberate Taiwan; the students and people of Korea are also rising up to defend their motherland."

　　Speaking of the Korean students and people—Chinese students’ close comrades and brothers, the representatives expressed deep respect and concern. Gao Jing, a student representative from Northeast China, talked about how students in the Northeast had celebrated the liberation of Seoul together with Korean students in the Northeast; Dong Xuelong, a student representative from Yunnan, proposed that Chinese students take effective actions to support the Korean students who are fighting heroically against American imperialism. "They are going to the battlefield today to defend their country, and tomorrow they will return to the classroom to study happily." One representative said resolutely with confidence. This is because Chinese students have come from such a glorious road of struggle. Li Rongchun in the delegation—formerly a little devil in the Red Army, is now a student at the Renmin University of China; Dong Xuelong—a student at Kunming Normal College, was still a political commissar of a guerrilla force in Kunyang County, Yunnan a year ago.

　　Imperialism is not to be feared, and the power of the people will surely defeat it, many representatives said. This is also the conclusion that Chinese students have drawn after thirty years of anti-imperialist struggle and finally achieved victory. The representatives all expressed their intention to bring the valuable experience of Chinese students to this World Student Congress, and to encourage students who are fighting against imperialism with the happy lives that Chinese students are living in the victorious New China.

　　"We must unite closely, very closely, with students all over the world to fight for lasting peace, national independence, democratic education, and a better future for young people." The representatives mentioned that they would take the Chinese students' peace signature book to the conference to tell students all over the world about the determination of Chinese students to oppose American imperialist war-mongers and defend world peace.

　　将中国学生保卫和平的决心告诉全世界学生
    ——访出国学生代表团
    本报记者  金凤
    有着三十年反帝斗争传统、在帝国主义被驱逐出中国大陆而开始过着幸福生活的中国学生，对于美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜、台湾和其他国家的罪恶行为，感到切骨的愤慨；对于正在与美帝国主义进行斗争的朝鲜、日本等国家的学生，则有着深切的关怀和同情。出席世界第二次学生代表大会的中国学生代表团集中表现了中国学生这等情绪和意志。
    “帝国主义的侵略，这就意味着大批青年的失业、失学和遭受着特务、宪警的逮捕和屠杀”；全国学联也是代表团秘书长柯在铄—一个过去在国民党统治区被登上黑名单，被迫流亡的学生这样愤愤地说：“中国学生很熟悉美帝国主义。在北京，美军奸污过我们学校的女同学”。“但是，全国各地的学生都起来喊出美军滚出中国去！人民解放军打过来了，美军毕竟滚出了中国大陆。现在它还在朝鲜、台湾逞凶，但我们一定要解放台湾；朝鲜的学生和人民也正在奋起保卫自己的祖国。”
    提到了朝鲜学生和人民——中国学生亲密的战友和兄弟，代表们都表示了深深的敬意和关怀。东北学生代表高静谈到东北同学曾经和在东北的朝鲜同学一起庆祝汉城的解放；云南学生代表董学隆提出中国学生要采取有效行动来支援正与美帝进行着英勇斗争的朝鲜学生。“他们今天为保卫祖国而走上战场，明天就将回到课堂来幸福的学习。”一个代表充满了信心决然地说。这是因为中国学生是从这样光荣的战斗道路上走过来的。代表团中的李荣春—从前是红军的小鬼，今天是中国人民大学的学生；董学隆—昆明师范学院的学生，一年前还是云南昆阳县一支游击队的政治委员。
    帝国主义是不可怕的，人民的力量一定能够打垮它，许多代表都这样说。这也是中国学生经过三十年反帝斗争，并在最后获得胜利的结论。代表们都表示要将中国学生这些宝贵的斗争经验带到这次世界学生代表大会上去，并且要以中国学生在胜利的新中国所过的幸福生活来鼓舞正在与帝国主义作斗争的学生们。
    “我们要紧紧地、紧紧地和全世界的学生团结起来，为争取持久和平、民族独立、民主教育与青年们更美好的未来而斗争”。代表们提到他们要带着中国学生的和平签名册到大会上去，把中国学生反对美帝国主义战争贩子、保卫世界和平的决心告诉全世界的学生。
