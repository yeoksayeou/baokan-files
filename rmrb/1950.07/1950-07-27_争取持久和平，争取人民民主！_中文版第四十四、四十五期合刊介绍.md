Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: The combined issue No. 44 and 45 of the Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

　　The editorial of the 44th issue is entitled "Further Expand and Strengthen the Peace Movement." The editorial points out: The Stockholm Appeal has placed the vital question of our time before the conscience of every political and cultural worker, all political parties and groups, and every individual: peace and survival, or war and destruction? There is no third way. This question cannot be avoided, because the people of all countries and the logic of events resolutely demand an answer. The editorial says: The prohibition of atomic weapons and the struggle for peace should be openly discussed in all countries. This will not only expose those who are preparing for war, but also help to eliminate many prejudices and illusions of honest people who have been misled by the propaganda of imperialist warmongers. The peace camp will thus be more consolidated and more organized. People will see that the warmongers are only a handful of pitiful adventurers, and that the people of all nations, with their united strength, can and certainly will prevent their war actions.

　　The title of the editorial in the 45th issue is "The Right-Wing Socialist Accomplices of the Warmongers." The editorial exposes the ugly activities of the leaders of the British Labour Party, the French Socialist Party, the Japanese Socialist Party, the Australian Labour Party, the Austrian Socialist Party, the Dutch Socialist Party, and the West German Social Democratic Party in serving the British and American warmongers. The editorial points out: The right-wing socialist leaders are fierce enemies of peace and direct accomplices of the British and American warmongers. The imperialists are pinning their main hopes on the right-wing socialist leaders. These right-wing socialist leaders have been assigned to sabotage the movement of peace supporters from within, to deceive the people, to confuse their minds, and to make them believe in the "peaceful intentions" of American imperialism. The editorial says: To maintain peace and to smash the criminal schemes of the warmongers, unity in the ranks of the working class is necessary. This unity can only be achieved through a resolute struggle against the right-wing socialist splitters.

　　The 45th issue of the journal prominently published Chairman Mao's article "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation’s Financial and Economic Situation."

　　The article "The Fascist Tito Group—War Provocateurs in the Balkans" by Yefkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, published in the 44th issue, reveals in detail the Tito clique's frantic war preparations under the command of American imperialism, its espionage and sabotage activities against people's democratic countries, and its deception and slanderous propaganda against the Yugoslav people.

　　The article "The Organization of the Bucharest Party in the Signature Campaign" by Stoika, Secretary of the Bucharest Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, vividly introduces the experience of the Bucharest Party organization in organizing the signature campaign to defend world peace.

　　The article "Important Work in the Development of the Hungarian National Economy" by Gerő, Deputy General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party, published in the 45th issue, discusses the importance of strengthening labor discipline, implementing the piece-rate wage system, and establishing a responsibility system in industry, based on the experience of Hungarian industrial construction.

　　In addition, the combined issue No. 44 and 45 also includes "The National Liberation Movement in French West Africa and Equatorial Africa" by Daboucié, Secretary-General of the African Democratic Union; "The People of North Africa Fight for Peace and Freedom" by Fex, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party; "On the Bulgarian Communist Party’s Organization and Political Work with the Masses" by Chervenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; and "MacArthur's Terror Cannot Defeat the Fighting Spirit of Japanese Patriots" by Todorov.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十四、四十五期合刊介绍
    【新华社二十五日讯】“争取持久和平、争取人民民主!”中文版第四十四、四十五期合刊已经出版。
    该刊第四十四期社论题为“争取和平运动的更加扩大与加强”。社论指出：斯德哥尔摩宣言已经把我们时代生命攸关的问题置于每一个政治与文化工作者、一切的政党与团体、每一个人的良心面前：和平与生存呢，还是战争与毁灭呢？没有第三条道路。这个问题是逃避不了的，因为各国人民与事件的逻辑坚决要求一个回答。社论说：应该在一切国家公开讨论禁止原子武器，公开讨论争取和平斗争的事情。这样将不仅暴露那些正在准备战争的人们，而且也将帮助消除被帝国主义战争贩子的宣传引入歧途的正直人们的许多偏见和幻想。和平阵营将因此更加巩固，更加有组织。人们将看到：战争贩子不过是一小撮可怜的冒险家，各族人民以联合的力量是可能而且一定阻止得住他们的战争行动的。
    第四十五期社论的题目是“战争贩子们的右翼社会党同谋犯”。社论揭露了英国工党、法国社会党、日本社会党、澳大利亚工党、奥地利社会党、荷兰社会党、西德社会民主党领袖们的为英美战争贩子服务的丑恶活动。社论指出：右翼社会党领袖们是和平的凶恶敌人，是英美战争贩子的直接同谋犯。帝国主义分子们正把他们的主要希望寄托在右翼社会党领袖们的身上。这些右翼社会党领袖们已被派定了去从内部破坏和平拥护者的运动，去欺骗人民，去混乱他们的思想，去使他们相信美帝国主义的“和平意图”。社论说：为了维护和平，为了粉碎战争贩子们的犯罪图谋，工人阶级队伍中的团结是必要的。这种团结，只有靠对右翼社会党分裂者进行坚决的斗争才能获得。
    该刊第四十五期以显著地位刊登了毛主席的“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”一文。
    第四十四期刊载的保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记叶夫柯夫的“法西斯铁托集团——巴尔干的战争挑拨者”一文，详细揭露了铁托匪帮在美帝国主义指挥下疯狂备战、对人民民主国家进行特务破坏活动、以及对南斯拉夫人民进行欺骗诽谤宣传的情形。
    罗马尼亚工人党布加勒斯特委员会书记斯托依卡的“签名运动中的布加勒斯特党的组织”一文，生动地介绍了布加勒斯特的党组织在组织保卫世界和平签名工作中的经验。
    第四十五期登载的匈牙利工人党副总书记格罗的“匈牙利国民经济发展中的重要工作”一文，根据匈牙利工业建设的经验，论述了在工业中加强劳动纪律、实行计件工资制、建立负责制的重要性。
