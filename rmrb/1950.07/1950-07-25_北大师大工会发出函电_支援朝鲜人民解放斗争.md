　　Peking University and Normal University Trade Unions Send Letters and Telegrams
　　Supporting the Korean People's Liberation Struggle
    [This newspaper] The entire membership of the Peking University and Normal University trade unions have written letters and sent telegrams expressing support for the Korean people's liberation struggle.
    The entire membership of Peking University's trade union wrote a letter to the Korean people on July 20, expressing extreme hatred for the American imperialists directing the Syngman Rhee gang to provoke war and further directly launch armed aggression. The letter stated: "We are watching with unparalleled enthusiasm as you fight the enemy bravely for the sake of your motherland. We are thrilled to see that your struggle is giving the invaders relentless blows, causing them to suffer repeated defeats." The letter also firmly believes that the united, enormous, and infinite strength of the Korean people will surely drive the American imperialists completely out of Korean territory and complete the great cause of Korean freedom and independence.
    The Education Workers' Union of Beijing Normal University said in a telegram to the Korean people on the 19th: "The days of your national liberation, unification, freedom, and happiness are just around the corner! All peace-loving people in the world are sympathizing with you, helping you, and cheering for your victory! All faculty and staff of our Beijing Normal University will definitely do everything in our power, together with all Chinese educators and all Chinese people, under the leadership of our Chairman Mao, to support your liberation war! Continue your efforts! Victory will surely belong to you! And it will surely belong to the people of the world!" (Peking University and Normal University Correspondence Group)
