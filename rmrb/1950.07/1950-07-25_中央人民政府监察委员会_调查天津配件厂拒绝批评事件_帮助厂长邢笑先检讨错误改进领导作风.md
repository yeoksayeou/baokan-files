　　Central People's Government Supervision Committee
    Investigates Tianjin Parts Factory's Rejection of Criticism
    Helps Factory Director Xing Xiaoxian Examine Mistakes and Improve Leadership Style
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Worker's Daily published a letter from worker correspondent Yang Enqing of the Tianjin Steel Parts Factory of the Ministry of Railways Materials Bureau on April 25th, reflecting some problems in the factory's leadership. After the letter was published, Xing Xiaoxian, the factory director of Tianjin Steel Parts Factory, not only did not conduct criticism and self-criticism based on the content of the letter, but also talked to Wang Yuan, a reporter from the Worker's Daily who was interviewing in Tianjin, and ridiculed the newspaper for publishing letters exposing shortcomings in the work. On May 17th, the factory wrote a letter to the Worker's Daily, explaining many of the issues reported by the correspondent, but did not make a deep self-criticism. When the Worker's Daily published the factory's reply on May 25th, it also published the newspaper reporter Wang Yuan's "Investigation of Tianjin Steel Factory No. 1" and the process of the reporter's conversation with factory director Xing Xiaoxian, and the editor added a note pointing out that the factory's attitude towards criticism in the newspaper was wrong, and hoped that the factory would further examine its work. After the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council discovered the above incident, in order to solve this problem and promote the development of the criticism and self-criticism movement, it specially cooperated with the Ministry of Railways to send a working group to the factory on June 1st to conduct actual investigations. After in-depth on-site understanding and listening to the feedback from employees, it was proved that the situation reported by worker correspondent Yang Enqing was correct, and the investigation report by reporter Wang Yuan was basically correct, with only a few problems being reported inappropriately. In addition, the investigation also found that the factory's leadership lacked a clear understanding of relying on the working class to run the factory well, and had serious bureaucracy and a "patriarchal" style. The factory management committee was hasty from its conception to its establishment, and both the factory leadership and the management committee members had a vague understanding of the nature and role of the management committee. The resolutions of the management committee did not dare to let the committee members go to the workers to convey them, fearing that the worker committee members would convey them incorrectly, and attempted to replace them with simple administrative announcements. The opinions of the workers were not widely solicited before the management committee meetings. Workers reflected: "The management committee does not play any role at all." "They never tell us anything, and we don't know what they are doing." Factory director Xing Xiaoxian did not respect the independence of the trade union organization enough, believing that the trade union cadres elected by the workers had low levels and weak abilities, and could not do things well. Instead of patiently helping, he wrongly blamed them blindly. He rarely went deep into the site to understand the production and the workers' situation, but only sat in the office to arrange work and listen to reports, and even did not attend the mobilization meeting for production, and called this practice "relying on the organization to promote work." For cadres in the factory who had shortcomings or mistakes, he did not give correct criticism and education, but adopted a patriarchal "reprimand" method, making everyone afraid of him and not daring to raise opinions. In addition, the leadership always delayed in resolving the rationalization proposals raised by the workers and issues related to production, hygiene, and welfare in a timely manner.
    When the working group first arrived at the factory, factory director Xing Xiaoxian was still dissatisfied with the Worker's Daily reporter and correspondent, and refused to accept criticism. After the working group cadres cited specific facts and patiently helped him, and emphasized that "the problems mentioned in the report are only a part of the shortcomings, and the main problem lies in the leadership's thinking and work style." After many days of self-struggle, factory director Xing Xiaoxian finally admitted his mistakes. On June 10th, at the general meeting of all employees, he made a relatively deep self-examination, expressing his complete acceptance of the newspaper's criticism, and explained that "in the future, I will definitely put down the bureaucratic airs, go deep into the site and closely connect with the worker comrades to jointly improve the production of the parts factory." His attitude towards reporters and correspondents has also changed, realizing that: "Without the criticism from the correspondent and reporter and the help from the working group, the work of the parts factory would not change, and personal mistakes could not be corrected. If this continues, it will be very dangerous for the factory and for the individual."
    The Supervision Committee believes that Xing Xiaoxian's final voluntary attitude of correcting his mistakes is very good and decided to exempt him from punishment. At the same time, the Supervision Committee believes that Xing Xiaoxian's initial refusal to accept criticism and his wrong attitude towards worker correspondents and reporters are closely related to his serious bureaucracy and self-righteousness in his work. At present, this style is prevalent among some cadres in government agencies and enterprises, and therefore many bad consequences have arisen in the work. To eradicate this bad style, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, welcome and organize the supervision of the masses, and regularly inspect the work. The most effective weapon is to carry out criticism and self-criticism. The Supervision Committee specially calls on all cadres to carefully study the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, and earnestly launch criticism and self-criticism.

### 中央人民政府监察委员会  调查天津配件厂拒绝批评事件  帮助厂长邢笑先检讨错误改进领导作风

　　中央人民政府监察委员会
    调查天津配件厂拒绝批评事件
    帮助厂长邢笑先检讨错误改进领导作风
    【本报讯】北京工人日报于四月二十五日登载了铁道部材料局天津钢铁配件一厂工人通讯员杨恩庆的一封信，反映该厂的领导上存在着的一些问题。该信登出后，天津钢铁配件厂厂长邢笑先不但未根据信上内容进行批评检讨，反而找工人日报在天津采访的记者王源去谈话，并对报纸发表揭露工作缺点的信件加以嘲讽。五月十七日，该厂写信给工人日报，对通讯员报道的问题，多所解释，未作深刻的检讨。工人日报于五月二十五日刊出该厂回信时，同时发表了该报记者王源的“天津钢铁一厂调查”以及记者和厂长邢笑先谈话的经过，编者并加上按语，指出该厂这种对待报纸上批评的态度是错误的，希望该厂进一步检查自己的工作。中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会发现上述事件后，为了解决此项问题并推动批评与自我批评运动的开展，特协同铁道部派员组成工作组，于六月一日赴该厂进行实际调查。经深入现场了解并听取职工反映后，证明工人通讯员杨恩庆报道的情况是正确的，记者王源的调查报道，基本上也是正确的，仅个别问题的报道欠妥。另外，调查中并发现该厂领导上依靠工人阶级办好工厂的思想不明确，有严重的官僚主义与“家长制”作风。工厂管理委员会从酝酿到成立都很草率，工厂领导方面及管委会委员对管委会的性质、作用都认识不清。管委会的决议不敢让委员到工人中去传达，怕工人委员传错，而企图以简单的行政布告来代替。管委会开会前也不普遍征求工人群众的意见。工人反映：“管委会根本不起作用。”“从来也不给我们说说，不晓得他们在搞些什么。”厂长邢笑先对工会组织上的独立性尊重不够，认为工人中选出来的工会干部水平低，能力弱，办不了事。不去耐心帮助，而错误地一味责备。他很少深入现场去了解生产与工人的情况，只是坐在办公室里布置工作，听取汇报，甚至布置生产的动员大会也不去参加，而自己称这种作法为“依靠组织推动工作”。对厂内干部有缺点或错误，不予以正确的批评教育而采取家长式的“训斥”办法，使大家都怕他，有意见不敢提。此外，对工人提出的合理化建议以及有关生产、卫生、福利等问题，领导方面总是拖延不予及时解决。
    工作组初到该厂时，厂长邢笑先对工人日报记者与通讯员仍表不满，拒绝接受批评。经工作组干部举出具体事实，耐心地予以帮助，并着重指出“报导中所提的问题仅是一部分缺点，主要的问题还在于领导思想与工作作风上”。厂长邢笑先经过了多日的自我斗争，终于承认了自己的错误。六月十日，在全厂职工大会上，作了比较深刻的自我检讨，表示完全接受报纸的批评，并说明“今后一定放下官僚架子，深入现场和职工同志紧密地联系起来，共同把配件厂的生产提高一步”。他对记者与通讯员的态度也改变了，认识到：“如果没有通讯员及记者的批评和工作组的帮助，配件厂的工作不会改变，个人错误不可能改正。发展下去，对工厂对个人都是十分危险的。”
    监察委员会认为邢笑先最后自愿改正错误的态度很好，决定免予处分。同时，监察委员会认为邢笑先最初不接受批评以及对待工人通讯员和记者的错误态度是与其工作中严重的官僚主义，自以为是有密切联系的。目前，此种作风在政府机构与企业部门的一部分干部中普遍存在，因此工作中产生了许多恶果。铲除这种恶劣作风，必须充分发扬民主，欢迎并组织群众的监督和经常地检查工作，最有效的武器是开展批评与自我批评。监察委员会特号召全体干部好好学习中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定，认真地展开批评与自我批评。
