Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 6th: To systematically adjust industry and commerce, cities with populations over 30,000 in Henan Province, some important market towns, and Changsha City in Hunan Province have universally launched industrial and commercial survey and registration work. Since the beginning of June, more than 70,000 industrial and commercial households in fourteen cities in Henan Province, including Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe, have completed registration procedures with the local Industrial and Commercial Bureau, following the industrial and commercial survey and registration methods promulgated by the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee. Nearly 600 cadres from nine cities including Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xuchang are participating in this work. The registration work in each area is uniformly led by the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bureau, and coordinated with relevant parties such as the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade associations to organize industrial and commercial survey and registration committees or registration committees for each industry, under which branch associations, sub-branch associations, and groups are set up. At the beginning of the registration work, each area successively transferred cadres for training (such as studying documents and practicing filling out forms), then separately launched publicity and education work, and finally moved into the investigation of typical industries. However, due to insufficient understanding of policies by industrial and commercial operators and insufficient in-depth publicity work, coupled with the commandist style of individual cadres, some concerns were raised among industrial and commercial operators, some passively resisted, dispersed and concealed assets, and even some industrial and commercial households fled. Therefore, the leading organs in various areas focused on propaganda and explanation through lectures, seminars, radio stations, and newspapers, which gradually dispelled the ideological concerns of industrial and commercial operators, who dared to openly report their business and financial situations. For example, the capital of the western medicine industry in Luohe City this time was twice the previously registered figure, and the registration number of the cigarette industry this time was also more than double the previous registration. Secondly, financial and economic leading organs in various areas also combined publicity and registration work to promptly help solve problems that could be solved, and help private industry overcome current production difficulties. For example, after the registration of machine sand casting, soap and other industries in Kaifeng City, the state bank and state trade organs used methods such as loans, orders, and entrusted processing to help solve some of their difficulties. Luohe adjusted the difference between wholesale and retail prices of salt and other commodities in connection with registration work. This played a considerable role in the development of registration work. Through this survey and registration, the financial and economic organs in various regions have further understood the general basic situation of industrial and commercial households, and laid a good foundation for future industrial and commercial adjustment work.

　　河南湖南重要市镇
    展开工商业调查登记
    深入宣传解释打破工商户顾虑结合填报登记帮助解决了困难
    【新华社汉口六日电】为了有计划地调整工商业，河南省三万人口以上的城市、个别重要集镇和湖南的长沙市等地已普遍展开工商业调查登记工作。河南省的开封、郑州、许昌、漯河等十四个城市，自六月上旬开始至今，已有七万余工商业户按中南军政委员会贸易部颁布的工商业调查登记办法，向当地工商局办理了登记手续。参加这一工作的干部，仅郑州、开封、许昌等九个城市即将近六百人。各地的登记工作都由市工商局统一领导，并配合工商联合会、同业公会等有关方面，组织工商业调查登记委员会或各个行业登记委员会，其下并设分会、支会及小组。在登记工作开始时，各地曾先后抽调干部，进行训练（如学习文件、练习填表格等），然后分别展开宣传教育工作，最后转入典型行业的调查。但由于工商业者对政策了解不够和宣传工作不够深入，加以个别干部存在命令主义的作风，致引起若干工商业者的顾虑，有的消极抗拒，分散隐蔽资财，甚至曾发生个别工商业户逃跑的现象。因此，各地领导机关即通过讲演、座谈会、广播台、报纸着重进行了宣传、解释工作，终于使工商业者的思想顾虑逐步解除，而敢于公开自己的经营和财务情况。如漯河市西药业这次登记的资本数比过去所登记的数字增加了两倍，卷烟业这次的登记数也比过去所登记的增加了一倍以上。其次，各地财经领导机关还结合宣传及填报登记工作，及时帮助解决可能解决的问题，帮助私营工业克服当前生产中的困难。如开封市机器翻砂、肥皂等业经登记后，国家银行和国家贸易机关即以贷款、订货和委托加工等办法，帮助解决其部分困难。漯河结合登记工作，调整了食盐等批发价与零售价的差额。这对登记工作的开展起了相当大的作用。各地财经机关经过这次调查登记，已进一步了解了工商业户的一般基本情况，又为今后调整工商业工作，奠定了良好基础。
