Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The Finance and Economics Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has banned the import of benzene from July 15th in order to support domestic benzene production and save foreign exchange. China's domestically produced benzene is now more than self-sufficient. It is estimated that the Northeast will have a surplus of 9,500 tons by the end of this year. At present, the annual demand for benzene by the dye, pharmaceutical, and rubber industries in East China is about 2,000 tons, but sales have been impossible because the price of benzene sold on commission by the Northeast to the East China Trading Company is higher than that of imported goods. For this reason, the Finance and Economics Committee of the Government Administration Council has decided that the Ministry of Heavy Industry should find ways to reduce the domestic production cost of benzene, and at the same time ban the import of benzene.

　　财经委员会禁止苯进口
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为扶助国内苯之生产与节省外汇，自七月十五日起禁止苯进口。我国内生产的苯现在已能自给有余，本年东北估计至年底可积存九千五百吨。目前华东染料、药物、橡胶等工业年需苯约二千吨左右，但因东北委托华东贸易公司代销苯之价格较进口货为高，致无法销售。为此，政务院财经委员会决定由重工业部设法减低国内苯之生产成本，同时禁止苯进口。
