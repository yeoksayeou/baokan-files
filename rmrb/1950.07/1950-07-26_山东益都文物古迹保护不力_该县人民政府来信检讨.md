　　Shandong Yidu Fails to Protect Cultural Relics and Historical Sites
    County People's Government Submits Self-Criticism
    Editor's Note: Below is reader Cai Cheng's suggestion for Shandong Yidu County to protect cultural relics and historical sites, and the reply from the Yidu County People's Government of Shandong Province.

    Editor Comrade:
    Qingzhou (i.e., Yidu), Shandong, is one of the Nine Provinces of Yu Gong. For more than two thousand years, it has had many cultural relics and historical sites. In the past, during the rule of the enemy, puppets, and the Kuomintang, due to arbitrary felling and destruction, many scenic spots and historical sites on Yunmen and Tuo Ridge mountains, as well as inside and outside the city, were damaged. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, decisions were issued one after another to protect cultural relics and historical sites in various places. The county and city governments of Qufu, Zou County, Jinan, and other places in Shandong have mostly organized the management and repair of cultural relics, historical sites, and scenic spots. This attitude of valuing national cultural relics and historical sites is worthy of praise. However, my Yidu County Government has not paid attention to it in the two years since entering the city. For example, outside the west gate of the county seat, Fan Gong Pavilion, Sanxian Temple, Shunhe Tower, and Sisong Pavilion, and inside the city, Feng Wenyi's Ou Garden... the houses, rockeries, pavilions, and other buildings are all being demolished by the masses. The large bell in the Duo Tower in Beimenli is one of Qingzhou's famous cultural relics, but it was moved by the county government for use as a work bell. Also, the city walls around it are being demolished at will, and there are broken bricks everywhere under the city. Tourists visiting Qingzhou are all saddened by the destruction of Qingzhou's cultural relics and historical sites. I hope that the county government will promptly and effectively protect cultural relics and historical sites and try to repair them as much as possible.

    Editor Comrade:
    We received a letter on July 7th from Comrade Cai Cheng, a reader of your newspaper, forwarded by the Special Commissioner's Office, containing opinions on the protection of Qingzhou's cultural relics and historical sites. We offer the following self-criticism:
    The houses and trees on Yidu Yunmen Mountain, Feng Wenyi's Ou Garden, Fan Gong Pavilion, and Shunhe Tower were severely damaged during the enemy occupation, and there were still signs of destruction after liberation. However, protection was carried out under the instructions of the East China Bureau and the Provincial Government. The small pine trees on Yunmen Mountain (the large trees were all cut down by the enemy) were initially stolen, but this was stopped afterward. The rockeries and pavilions in Feng Wenyi's Ou Garden have not been damaged since liberation. Only the pine trees on the rockery were stripped of their bark by the caretaker of the Feng Family Ancestral Hall, who secretly tried to kill the trees and cut them down. After this was discovered, it was stopped. Director Li of the County Public Security Bureau also educated the caretaker of the Feng Family Ancestral Hall, instructing him and the street chief to be responsible for safekeeping. Li Huating from Nanxiguan, who stole and cut down locust trees in the City God Temple, has been detained by the County Public Security Bureau. As for Fan Gong Pavilion, we ordered the Ordinary District to be responsible for protection. The district and village cadres also went to the pavilion to specifically explain the matter to the Wang family who lived there. As a result, the historical site has not been damaged.
    In the winter of 1948, because Yidu had just been liberated, unemployed workers and urban poor people were having difficulties in their lives, and it coincided with the fact that the station and several factories wanted to buy city bricks. The government (municipal government) believed that this could both supply construction and solve the problem of disaster victims' livelihoods, so it agreed to demolish the city walls. After the Special Commissioner's Office discovered this, it ordered it to be stopped. In addition to making a self-criticism to the Special Commissioner's Office, the county government immediately issued a notice prohibiting further demolition and educated the masses through the trade union.
    The large bell in Beimenli was moved and properly preserved under the instructions of the Special Commissioner's Office because the houses around the Duo Tower were all destroyed, and the Duo Tower was also dilapidated and leaking, fearing that the bell would be damaged. We once used it as a work bell for the office, but this phenomenon was stopped and it was properly preserved.
    The above is the main process of protecting ancient buildings and other structures after liberation. However, there are still shortcomings in management, such as:
    (1) Failure to establish a specialized organization from top to bottom, absorbing relevant people to participate in management. Excessive consideration was given to the difficulty of financial expenditure, and no money was spent on guarding and repairing them.
    (2) There was a narrow-minded relief perspective when demolishing the city. At the same time, no thorough plan was made in advance, resulting in piles of broken bricks after demolition, which made it easier to cause theft.
    (3) Failure to deeply educate and mobilize the masses to protect national cultural relics and historical sites, so that the phenomenon of theft could not be avoided. We will try our best to overcome this in the future.
                        Yidu County People's Government

### 山东益都文物古迹保护不力  该县人民政府来信检讨

　　山东益都文物古迹保护不力
    该县人民政府来信检讨
    编者按：下面是读者蔡澄对山东益都县保护文物古迹的建议及山东省益都县人民政府的复信。编辑同志：
    山东青州（即益都）为禹贡九州之一，二千多年来，文物古迹甚多。过去敌伪国民党统治时期，由于任意砍伐破坏，以致云门、驼岭两山及城内外许多名胜古迹，多被损毁。中央人民政府成立后，曾先后颁发保护各地文物古迹的决定。我山东曲阜、邹县、济南……各县市政府对于文物古迹名胜，多已组织保管并加修缮。这种重视国家文物古迹的态度，是值得表扬的。惟我益都县政府进驻城市二年余来，迄未予以重视。如目前县城西门外范公亭、三贤祠、顺河楼、四松亭，城内冯文毅偶园……房屋、假山、亭台等建筑物，均听任群众拆毁。北门里铎楼的大铎，为青州著名文物之一，被县政府移充作息钟之用。又四周城墙，任被拆除，城下到处是碎砖。来青游览人士，目睹青州文物古迹的损毁，莫不引为憾事。我希望该县政府对于文物古迹，迅即有效地加以保护与尽可能地设法修缮。
                                                       蔡澄编辑同志：
    七月七日收到专署转来贵报读者蔡澄同志对保护青州文物古迹的意见书一件。我们作如下检讨：
    益都云门山、冯文毅偶园、范公亭、顺河楼等房屋树木，敌占时期破坏极甚，解放后仍有破坏现象。但在华东局与省府指示下即进行了保护。云门山之小松树（大树已尽为敌人砍掉）初有被窃，以后即予制止。冯文毅偶园之假山亭台解放后即未经破坏，只有假山上之松树，因系冯氏祠堂，看守人曾私将四棵松树的树皮剥光，企图把树弄死砍掉，经发觉后即予制止。县公安局黎局长并对冯氏祠堂看守人进行了教育，责成他及该街街长负责保管。南西关李华廷偷砍城隍庙槐树，已被县公安局拘押处理。至于范公亭，我们曾令普通区负责保护，该区区乡村干部亦均曾亲往该处与住亭人王姓具体交待，因之该处古迹未遭破坏。
    一九四八年冬，因益都解放不久，失业工人以及城市贫民生活困难，并适值车站和几个工厂要收买城砖。政府（市府）鉴于这样既能供应建设，又能解决灾民生活，即同意拆除城墙。专署发觉后即令制止。县府除向专署作了检讨外，当即出布告禁止继续拆除，当通过工会对群众进行教育。
    北门里之大铎，因铎楼四周房屋均遭破坏，而铎楼亦破烂漏水，恐铎遭受破坏，故专署指令运转妥处保存。我们曾一度将其用作机关作息钟，后即制止这种现象，并将其妥为保存。
    以上系解放后对古迹建筑等保护之主要经过。但在管理上还是存在缺点的，如：
    （一）未能从上而下成立专门组织，吸收有关人士参加管理。过分考虑财政开支困难，未能出钱看管和加以修葺。
    （二）拆城时存有狭隘的救济观点。同时，事前未作周密计划，致拆除后破砖累累，更易引起偷拆现象。
    （三）没有深入教育，发动群众进行对国家文物古迹的保护，致使偷拆现象未能免除。今后当尽力克服。
                        益都县人民政府
