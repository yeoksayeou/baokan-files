Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 20th—The Yunnan Gejiu Tin Company has exceeded its production plan for the first half of the year. The company resumed normal production in April, and by the end of June, production exceeded the plan by 14%. In May, due to a shortage of hydroelectric power, the ore dressing department was shut down for 25% of the time. However, the workers' attendance rate was generally above 90%, so the difficulty of the power shortage did not affect the completion of the plan.

　　云南个旧锡业公司
    上半年生产超过计划
    【新华社昆明二十日电】云南个旧云南锡业公司上半年度生产计划已超额完成。该公司于四月恢复正常生产，到六月底生产超过计划百分之十四。五月份因水电缺乏，选矿部停工时间占百分之二十五。但工人出勤率一般都在百分之九十以上，因而使水电缺乏的困难并没有影响计划的完成。
