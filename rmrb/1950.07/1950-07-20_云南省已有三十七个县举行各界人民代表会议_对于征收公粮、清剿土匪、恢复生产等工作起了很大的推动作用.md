Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th. Since the liberation of Yunnan Province, thirty-seven counties, including Chuxiong, Xuanwei, Yuxi, Mengzi, Wuding, Qujing, Zhaotong, Dali, and Wenshan, have convened people's representative conferences. The convening of these conferences has initially strengthened the connection between the people's government and the masses, greatly promoting various tasks. For example, in the work of grain collection, the person in charge of the people's government explained the significance and policy of grain collection through the people's representative conferences. After discussions, the representatives actively carried out propaganda and assisted the district and village governments in collecting grain. Representatives from Xuanwei, Chenggong, and other counties immediately convened meetings with the masses after returning to their hometowns to publicize the significance of grain collection and expose the rumors spread by bad elements, which enabled the grain collection work to proceed smoothly. In addition, the people's representative conferences in various counties have made important resolutions after detailed discussions on work such as bandit suppression, tax rectification, promoting the use of Renminbi in rural areas, and restoring agricultural production. The people's governments and county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Chenggong and other counties issued instructions after the meetings, calling on cadres and Communist Party members in various districts and villages to resolutely ensure the implementation of the resolutions of the people's representative conferences. Leading cadres in Chuxiong, Huize, Shiping, and other counties attached great importance to the convening of the people's representative conferences, made full preparations before the meetings, and repeatedly discussed the work reports of the meetings. At the meetings, they made sincere self-criticisms of the shortcomings in their work, and inspired the representatives to have enthusiastic discussions. After the meetings, they used various methods to ensure the implementation of the resolutions. The convening of the people's representative conferences greatly enhanced the political prestige of the people's government and the Communist Party.

However, in a few places, the conferences did not give full play to the spirit of democracy, which prevented discussions from unfolding at the meetings and resolutions from being implemented after the meetings. For example, the Yuxi County conference mechanically and rigidly stopped the discussion of dissenting opinions. The conference lasted for three days but was irrelevant to the actual work. At the opening of the Jinning County conference, cadres told everyone to only talk about the difficulties of the country and not about personal difficulties, which limited the representatives' speeches. The higher-level people's government has corrected these deviations.

　　云南省已有三十七个县举行各界人民代表会议
    对于征收公粮、清剿土匪、恢复生产等工作起了很大的推动作用
    【新华社重庆八日电】云南全省解放后，已有楚雄、宣威、玉溪、蒙自、武定、曲靖、昭通、大理、文山等三十七个县召开了各界人民代表会议。上述各县各界人民代表会议的召开，初步使人民政府和群众的联系密切了，对于各种工作的推行起了很大的作用。如征收公粮工作，人民政府负责人通过各界人民代表会议说明了征粮的意义和政策，并进行讨论后，与会代表们回去均积极地展开了宣传，协助区村政府征收公粮。宣威、呈贡等县代表回乡后，立刻召集群众开会，宣传征粮意义，揭露了坏分子散布的谣言，使征粮工作得以顺利进行。此外，关于清剿土匪、整顿税收、推行人民币下乡和恢复农业生产等工作。各县各界人民代表会议都经过详细讨论，作出了重要的决议案。呈贡等县人民政府和中共县委于会后分别发出指示，号召各区村干部和共产党员，坚决保证各界人民代表会议决议的执行。楚雄、会泽、石屏等县领导干部很重视各界人民代表会议的召开，会前进行了充分准备，反复商讨了会议的工作报告；会上，对于工作上的缺点，进行了诚恳的检讨和自我批评，启发代表们热烈讨论；会后则用各种方法保证决议的执行。各界人民代表会议召开的结果，大大地提高了人民政府和共产党的政治威信。
    但是，也有少数地方的会议没有很好地发挥民主精神，使得会上的讨论不能展开，会后不能贯彻执行决议。如玉溪县的会议以机械生硬的方式制止了分歧意见的讨论。会议开了三天，却与实际工作无关。晋宁县的会议一开幕，干部就叫大家只谈国家困难，不谈个人困难，限制了代表们的发言。对于这些偏向，上级人民政府已予纠正。
