　　Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: According to a London dispatch from the British Information Service on the 5th, British Prime Minister Attlee first made a lengthy speech during a debate on the Korean issue in the British House of Commons on the 5th. In his speech, Attlee tried hard to defend the armed intervention in Korea by American and British imperialists and their direction of the Security Council in passing illegal resolutions. Despite the explicit provisions of the United Nations Charter prohibiting interference in the internal affairs of any country, Attlee even argued that the act of interfering in the internal affairs of Korea was "fulfilling the obligations of the United Nations Charter."
    In his speech, Attlee demonstrated the Labour government's unfriendly attitude towards the People's Republic of China. Attlee recognized the right of Chiang Kai-shek bandit Tingfu Tsiang's representation in the Security Council as legitimate, insisting that Chiang Kai-shek bandit Tingfu Tsiang "is qualified to occupy a seat representing China to vote." Attlee's arguments thoroughly exposed the British government's lack of sincerity in establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

　　艾德礼下院讲演充分暴露工党政府对我不友好态度 
    他竟承认蒋匪帮在安理会中有其“合法代表权”
    【新华社九日讯】据英新闻处伦敦五日电，英首相艾德礼于五日在英下院辩论朝鲜问题时，首先作了长篇发言。艾德礼在发言中，亟力为美英帝国主义者武装干涉朝鲜、及指挥安理会通过非法决议作辩护。尽管联合国宪章曾明文规定禁止干涉任何国家的内政，但艾德礼竟然强辩干涉朝鲜内政的行动是“履行了联合国宪章的义务”。
    艾德礼在他的发言中表现了工党政府对中华人民共和国的不友好态度。艾德礼承认安理会中蒋匪廷黻的代表权为合法，硬说蒋匪廷黻“有资格占有一席代表中国投票”。艾德礼的这些论调，彻底地暴露了英国政府没有诚意与中华人民共和国建立外交关系。
