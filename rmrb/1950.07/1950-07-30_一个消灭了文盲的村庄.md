　　A Village That Eliminated Illiteracy
    Everything is Changing
    Li Jiagou, Shuangdao District, Lushun, which has been awarded the title of "Literacy Model Village" three times, can no longer find a single illiterate person in the entire village. Of the 461 people in the village, 107 were adult illiterates a year ago. Now, 98 of these illiterates have learned more than 800 characters, and the remaining 9 have learned 400 to 500 characters.
    The cultural life of the peasants is rising along with their economic life. In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, production in Li Jiagou Village has gradually developed; especially since the implementation of land reform (land adjustment) last year, the peasants have completely turned over economically. Everything in the village is changing rapidly.
    Before the liberation in 1946, this village, which then had 52 households, had only over 2,300 mu of land, while one landlord household and three rich peasant households occupied more than 1,100 mu; the Japanese invaders seized more than 800 mu. The remaining 48 households were left with only more than 400 mu of poor land. The peasants struggled in poverty all year round, and many lived a life that was "half-human, half-ghost." Many peasants gathered at home day and night to play cards; fishermen returning from the sea got dead drunk; men beat their wives and children, indulging in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling; old and weak women went out to beg for food; and people suffering from poverty and illness knelt before the shrines to beg the gods and Buddhas for blessings. No one cared even when the crops ripened and the ears of grain fell to the ground. The peasants whiled away their time in such contradictory moods.
    Now, all of this has become a story of history.
    After the land adjustment, the whole village averaged nearly four mu of land per person; in recent years, more than 400 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Although each farmer household is cultivating more land, the cultivation is more meticulous and the fertilization is increased compared to previous years.
    There is a significant change in the peasants' thinking: "In the past, the poor had something to say, but now that the land has been divided, if we don't live well, we can only blame ourselves." In the past, the peasants did not dare to tell the truth about their grain yields, for fear of paying more taxes and revealing their wealth. This year, they are boasting of their harvests. In the past six months, the village has added seventeen head of livestock and many farm implements.

    Everyone Literate, Every Family Reads the Newspaper
    After the peasants turned over politically and economically, they immediately raised the demand for cultural learning. Wang Xiantang, a special-class literacy model, said: "Now we are in charge of our own affairs, and we can't do without knowledge."
    In Li Jiagou, no matter how busy the farming is or how bad the weather is, no one is absent from the women's literacy class at noon, the adult men's class in the evening, and the kang-head groups for old women. Li Deqin, who is paralyzed, still crawls to school to study in heavy rain. When someone tried to stop him, he said: "The Communist Party is leading me to study, and I must study hard. Are you still controlling me?" During the Japanese occupation, he also wanted to study, but he was poor and disabled, and he was rejected at the school gate twice. Now, he knows more than 2,000 characters. Wang Guilan, a mother of five children, always takes advantage of the light when she is cooking for the men working in the fields in the middle of the night to learn to read.
    Many peasants hang the graduation certificates issued by the Literacy Movement Committee on the wall. They solemnly frame them with mirrors and hang a portrait of Chairman Mao on them.
    The whole village subscribes to a total of 40 copies of various newspapers. The old women read the "Peasants' Daily" while watching the children under the shade of the trees. The women who are cooking in front of the stove draw characters on the ground with their hands and hum the song "Chairman Mao is Like the Sun" softly.

    Production and Learning, Labor is Glorious
    Production, learning, and labor are glorious. This is the common understanding of the men and women in the village. Women generally participate in production. They say: "In the first five years, it was a shame for any woman to go to the mountains, but now it is a shame for anyone not to go to the mountains." During the spring plowing, fifteen women in the village learned to hold the plow. Li Yuying, who is raising six children, took on the heavy task of cultivating more than 30 mu of land with a sixteen-year-old girl after her husband returned to the factory. They carry hoes up the mountains in groups; they drop their hoes and go to school to study. After working, some young women wash off the mud on their bodies, put on new purple-red silk clothes, and cover them with white headscarves. People may mistakenly think they are the daughters-in-law of the landlords in the past, but she will answer: "Now you can't judge people by their clothes. Women who farm should also wear good clothes."
    Several lazy people in the village have also joined in production. This spring, when mutual aid teams were reorganized on a voluntary basis, the lazy people were eliminated. So, they formed a group themselves, made up their minds, and competed with other mutual aid teams in production. This group's performance in farming this year is not bad. Li Maoxiang, who is in his sixties, has rented land for thirty or forty years in the past, getting poorer every year he farmed. In the end, he lost his energy, didn't farm the land properly, gambled, drank, cursed in the streets, and quarreled with his family all day long. After being allocated land, his bad habits changed, and he led his two sons to open four mu of wasteland and actively participated in literacy classes. There is still one lazy person left in the village. The whole village looks down on him. Everyone who goes to his house makes fun of him, and his whole family gives him advice. The village cadres are also determined to transform him.
    With the guarantee of family life, and with mutual aid teams doing the farming for them, and with women participating in production, some of the scattered technicians and surplus labor force in the village began to transfer to industry. Recently, fourteen people have entered factories. This year, the village has also begun to grow industrial raw material crops. For the first time in the history of the village, 97 mu of peanuts and 30 mu of cotton and hemp were planted.

    New Entertainment, New Life
    People's lives have completely changed. Playing cards, which used to be the most common pastime, has slowly disappeared after liberation. Everyone replaces it with literacy classes, entertainment parties, and the Yangko dance. The old and young in the village hold one or two cultural and recreational evenings at the cultural station every month. Several old women in their fifties and sixties have also formed a "cheering squad" to participate in singing and Yangko dancing. On the night of the Spring Festival this year, the cultural station held a party for more than 300 people. Everyone collectively paid New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao and made a fuss all night.
    The relationship between people is also different from the past. The phenomenon of neighbors quarreling and cursing in the streets has disappeared. More than half of the families have established "democratic family meetings." The mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law who used to quarrel now live in harmony, producing and learning together.
    There is no longer any garbage in the courtyards of each household, and adults and children are dressed in clean clothes. Everyone is paying attention to hygiene. Women go to new midwives when giving birth. Few people seek help from gods and Buddhas when they are sick. The village originally had six shamans, who have now switched careers and are participating in production.
    Li Jiagou is now planning to build a nursery, preparing to buy some toys for the children so that the mothers can feel at ease in production and learning, and the children can also have a comfortable place for entertainment. When the farmers have free time, they take time to build the avenue leading to the town. Everyone is also preparing to install electric lights in the village after the autumn harvest.

### 一个消灭了文盲的村庄

　　一个消灭了文盲的村庄
    一切都在变化着
    曾经三次获得“识字模范村”称号的旅顺双岛区李家沟，全村再也找不到一个不识字的人了。村里四百六十一个人，一年以前还有一百零七名成年文盲，现在，这些文盲中已有九十八人识到八百字以上，其余九人也都学会了四、五百字。
    农民的文化生活是跟着经济生活上升的。几年来，李家沟村在共产党和人民政府的领导下，生产逐渐发展；特别是去年实行了土地改革（土地调剂），农民在经济上彻底翻了身。村里的一切，都在迅速地起着变化。
    一九四六年解放以前，这个当时五十二户的村庄才有两千三百多亩地，而一户地主、三户富农就占去了一千一百多亩；日寇霸占去了八百多亩。其余四十八户，只剩下四百多亩薄地。农民们终年在贫困里挣扎着，很多人过着“鬼一半人一半”的生活。不少农民白天黑夜集在家里玩纸牌，从海滨回来的渔民喝得烂醉，男人们打老婆、打孩子，吃、喝、嫖、赌；老弱妇女出去要饭；贫病交加的人跪在神龛下面求神佛保佑。庄稼熟掉了穗也没人管。农民们就在这样矛盾的心情下消磨着时光。
    现在，这一切都成了历史上的故事。
    土地调剂后，全村每人平均分到近四亩地；近几年来又开垦了四百多亩荒地。尽管每个农户种的地增多了，可是耕种比往年细致、施肥比往年增加。
    农民的思想上有一个显著的变化：“过去穷有话说，如今分了地，日子再过不好那只有怨自己了。”过去农民打了粮食不敢说真话，怕多纳税，怕露了家底。今年，却夸耀着自己的丰收了。半年来，全村添了十七头牲口和很多农具。
    人人识字，家家看报
    当农民从政治上、经济上翻身之后，马上就提出了学习文化的要求。特等识字模范王宪堂说：“如今咱当家啦，当家没有知识可不行。”
    在李家沟，无论农事如何忙，天气如何坏，午间的妇女识字班、晚间的成年男子班和老太太们的炕头小组，都没有一个缺席的。瘫子李德钦下着大雨还爬着到学校去学习。当有人阻拦时，他说：“共产党领导我学习，我一定好好学习。你还管着我啦？”在日寇统治时代，他也很想念书，可是他穷，又是残废，两次被拒绝在学校门外。现在，他识了两千多字。有着五个孩子的母亲王桂兰，总是在半夜里趁着给上地干活的男人们作饭时的灯光识字。
    很多农民把识字运动委员会发给的毕业证书挂在墙上。他们郑重地镶上镜框，并在上面挂一幅毛主席的肖像。
    全村一共订有各种报纸四十份。老太太们在树荫下一边看孩子，一边念着《农民报》。在灶火前烧火的妇女顺手就在地下划字，轻声地哼着《毛主席像太阳》的歌曲。
    生产学习，劳动光荣
    生产，学习，劳动光荣。这是村里男男女女的共同认识。妇女们普遍参加了生产。她们说：“头五年谁家妇女上山是耻辱，如今谁不上山就成耻辱了。”春耕中，村子里有十五个妇女学会了扶犁。扶养着六个小孩的李玉英，在丈夫回到工厂后，和一个十六岁的姑娘承担了耕种三十多亩地的重担。她们成群结组地扛着锄头上山；丢下锄头就到学校去学习。在劳动之后，有的青年妇女洗去身上的泥土，穿上了紫红色的新绸衣，罩上洁白的头巾。人们也许会错认她们是过去地主家的媳妇，她将会回答说：“现在可不能按着衣裳看人，种地的妇女也该穿好的。”
    村里的几个懒汉也都参加了生产。今春按自愿改编互助组时，懒汉们被淘汰了。于是，他们自己结合编成一组，发下狠心，还和其他互助组竞赛生产。这一组今年种地的成绩也不坏。六十多岁的李茂香，过去租种了三、四十年地，种一年穷一年。最后他泄了劲，地不正经地种，赌钱、喝酒、骂大街，整日和家里吵骂。分到土地之后，他的坏毛病改变了，还领着两个儿子开了四亩荒，参加识字班学习也很积极。村里现在还剩下一个懒汉。全村都看不起他。到那家那家笑话他，回去全家对他提意见，村干部也有决心要改造他。
    家庭生活有了保证，又有互助组代耕，妇女们也参加了生产，一部分流散在村里的技术工人和剩余劳动力开始转入工业了。最近就有十四人进了工厂。村里今年又开始种工业原料作物。全村有史以来第一次种了九十七亩花生和三十几亩棉花和麻。
    新的娱乐，新的生活
    人们的生活完全变了样子。过去最普遍的玩纸牌，解放后慢慢消灭了。大家以上识字班、开娱乐晚会、扭秧歌来代替它。全村老幼每月总要在文化站举行一两次文娱晚会。几个五、六十岁的老太太也成立了“啦啦队”，参加唱歌和扭秧歌。今年春节夜里，文化站开了一个三百多人的晚会，大家集体给毛主席拜年，闹了一夜。
    人与人间的关系也与过去不同了，邻居之间吵嘴、骂街的现象没有了。一半以上的家庭建立了“民主家庭会”，过去爱吵闹的婆媳、妯娌，现在都和和气气，一块生产，一块学习。
    各户的院子里都不再存垃圾了，大人、孩子都穿着洁净的衣裳。大家都讲起卫生来了。妇女生小孩都去找新的接产员。有病也很少有人求神拜佛。村里原有六个巫神，现在都转业参加生产了。
    李家沟现在正计划盖一个托儿所，准备给孩子们买些玩具，好让母亲们安心生产与学习，孩子们也得到安适的娱乐场所。农民们有闲时就抽空修建那条通往城镇的大道。大家还预备在秋天丰收后把村子里装上电灯。
