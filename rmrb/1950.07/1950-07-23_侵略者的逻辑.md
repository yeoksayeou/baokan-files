　　The Logic of the Aggressor
　　Huang Yaomian
    American imperialists have a peculiar logic: they insist that all countries in the world should be their colonies, and all people in the world should be their slaves. If you resist, if you want freedom, they say you are the "aggressor." For example, Taiwan is our Chinese territory. It is our domestic affair to recover this territory and eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. But the American imperialists insist that this will hinder the "security and peace" of the Pacific, and send armed forces to directly interfere, even further colluding with the Chiang bandits to jointly discuss Taiwan's "defense" work. According to the logic of the American imperialists, the aggressor is not them, but the Chinese people! Don't you think this is a strange thing? Another example is the Korean incident. It was clearly the South Korean puppet, with the support of the American imperialists, provoking North Korea, which led to the uprising of the entire Korean people. And because the South Korean puppet government was useless, the American imperialists dispatched a large number of naval, air, and ground forces to directly interfere in Korea's internal affairs. Slaughtering the Korean people, isn't this American imperialist aggression against Korea? But according to the logic of the American imperialists, this is the Korean people's aggression against them. If that's the case, then those sitting in B-29 planes bombing the Korean people are the ones being invaded, and the farmers and women in the Korean fields bombed by the American imperialists are the aggressors; the American bandit soldiers who travel across the ocean to fight in Korea are the ones being invaded, and the Korean people who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland on their own land are the aggressors; those American imperialist generals who are planning to build bases everywhere are the ones being invaded, and we, the Chinese, Korean, Filipino, and Vietnamese people who yearn for the liberation of our motherlands, are the aggressors.
    Imperialists have become so insane today that they are beyond reason. The only way to deal with them is to unite the strength of the people of the world and give them a head-on blow. Only in this way can we teach them a lesson and make them clear-headed.

　　侵略者的逻辑
    黄药眠
    美帝国主义者，有着奇异的逻辑，就是它硬要认为全世界各国都应该是它的殖民地，全世界的人民都应该是它的奴隶，如果你要反抗，你要自由，它就说你是“侵略者”了。比方台湾是我们中国的土地，我们要收复这个土地，要消灭蒋介石残余匪帮，这是我们国内的事情。但美帝国主义者却硬要说这会妨碍太平洋的“安全与和平”，而要派武装来直接干涉，甚至还进一步和蒋匪勾结，共同商讨台湾的“防卫”工作。照美帝的逻辑说来，侵略者不是他们美帝，而是我们中国人民！你瞧，这不是一件奇异的事情吗？又比方朝鲜事件，明明是南朝鲜傀儡在美帝支持下向北朝鲜挑衅，以致引起全朝鲜人民的奋起反抗，又因为南朝鲜傀儡政府不中用，美帝乃出动大批的海空军以及地面部队来直接干涉朝鲜的内政。屠杀朝鲜的人民，这不是美帝对朝鲜的侵略，是什么呢？但照美帝的逻辑说来，这又是朝鲜人民对它的侵略。如果这样说法，那就坐在Ｂ—２９机上轰炸朝鲜人民的乃是被侵略者，而被美帝轰炸朝鲜的田野里的农民和妇女，倒是侵略者了；远渡重洋到朝鲜来作战的美帝匪兵是被侵略者，而在本国土地上为祖国之自由独立而战的朝鲜人民倒是侵略者了；那些整天计划要在什么地方建筑基地的美帝将军们是被侵略者，而我们这些渴求祖国解放的中国、朝鲜、菲律宾、越南的人民倒是侵略者了。
    帝国主义者，在今天已经疯狂到难以理喻的时候了。对付他的办法，惟有团结全世界人民的力量给以迎头痛击。只有这样，才能教训他，使他头脑清醒一点。
