The Miao People of Xinping Township, Qiancheng
    Li Jing, Li Dezhen
    Qiancheng County in Western Hunan has a total of 30,000 Miao people, accounting for 30% of the county's total population. Xinping Township, which has the largest concentration of Miao people, has a population of about 5,000, of whom 98% are Miao. Xinping Township is located near Fenghuang and Yongshui and is a region with many mountains and little farmland. The vast majority of Miao people "farm during the day and weave at night," living hardworking but difficult lives. There are very few landlords and rich peasants among the Miao people. For example, in the first bao [a local administrative unit] there are 180 households, of which only three are rich peasant households, and no landlords, while poor and hired peasants account for 118 households.
            The Bloody History of "Military Farms"
    In the past, the Miao people suffered the most brutal feudal oppression.
    The "military farm" system caused the Miao people the greatest suffering. As early as the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, the Miao people here, unable to bear the feudal oppression of the time, launched a revolutionary movement. The Qing government sent a large army to suppress the revolution, and all the rice paddies of the rebellious Miao people were confiscated, called "measuring the fields into the public," and the seized farmland was called "military farms." The rulers also adopted the vicious tactic of "using Miao to rule Miao," recruiting some unemployed people from among the Miao people to organize "Miao soldiers" to suppress the Miao people for a long time. "Military granaries" were set up to collect "military rent" to maintain military food supplies.
    Military farms were divided into two types: one was called "military rent land;" the other was a portion of good land drawn from the military farms, called "military chief land." Military rent land was collected by the government at 70% and the people retained 30% of the rent, called "the ruler takes seven, the people keep three." The military chief land was divided equally between the tenant farmers and the military chief (the granary official - Han Chinese). During the Kuomintang rule, so-called "land declarations" were implemented in 1945, nominally to "return military farms and military chief lands to the Miao people;" in reality, the Miao people still had to pay most of the harvest to the puppet government according to the acreage; moreover, during land measurement, the puppet government deliberately expanded the acreage figures of ordinary Miao people's cultivated land, measuring one mu as two mu, which further increased the burden on the Miao people. At the same time, local bullies took the opportunity of land measurement to seize the farmland of the Miao people. For example, the puppet military chiefs Xiong Shaotian, Shu Yaqin, Tian Ruifeng, and Wang Yueyu forcibly occupied 60 mu of "military chief land" and refused to return it to the original Miao farmers.
            Brutal Feudal Oppression
    The rent charged by ordinary landlords for renting out land was no lower than that of the "military farms," and the military chiefs and landlords often had the tenants do "free labor" for them. Not only was there no pay for "free labor," but even the food was not enough to eat. The landlords did not care whether the tenants were busy or not when they called for free labor, they had to go on time and quickly. Otherwise, the tenants would be subjected to various insults, and the land would be "taken back". In addition, every year during the autumn harvest, the tenants had to invite the landlords and military chiefs to divide the grain. At this time, the tenants had to prepare wine and meat to entertain the landlords, otherwise they would be in danger of having their land taken away.
    Usury was also a very serious form of exploitation. Often, landlords living in Qiancheng city or landlords and rich peasants in rich areas would lend out some grain in the spring, and demand half to double the interest at the autumn harvest. Especially during the Kuomintang rule, when the puppet currency was constantly devalued, the landlords lent out puppet currency and demanded repayment in kind after the autumn harvest. For example, in 1940, Chen Yi's wife from the first bao borrowed 800 yuan from the landlord Chen Jingyao, which was converted into four shi and eight dou of rice. In the autumn of the same year, she repaid five shi but still had not paid off the debt. Two years later, Chen Yi's family was forced to sell their land to the creditor, and the land price was only 3,100 yuan, but 2,300 yuan was deducted for the interest on the loan.
    The Kuomintang's conscription and exorbitant taxes caused even greater suffering to the Miao people. For example, three of Guan Shi's four sons, who were able to work, were conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang. Normally, a middle peasant family had to pay about 400 catties of rice each year for "bullet donations," "gun donations," "self-defense fees," and "xiangbao [township security] donations;" a poor peasant household had to pay 100 to 200 catties.
    In politics, the reactionary rulers despised the Miao people even more, calling them "Miaozi [a derogatory term for Miao people];" at the same time, the ruling class deliberately created divisions between the Han and Miao people, and many Miao people never dared to enter the city in their lives.
    In addition to economic and political oppression, the Miao people were also oppressed in culture. Very few Miao people are literate now. Superstition is deeply rooted. When sick, they mostly use superstitious methods such as "eating cattle" and "fulfilling vows" to "cure" their illnesses instead of medicine. Every time they kill cattle or pigs, they gather many people to eat and drink for many days, which is a great waste.
            The Miao People Raise Their Heads
    After liberation, due to the long-term influence of the reactionary ruling class on the Miao people, at first some Miao people were still somewhat skeptical of the Communist Party and the People's Government. However, the People's Government's correct ethnic policies and the People's Liberation Army's excellent mass discipline quickly had a huge impact on the Miao people. The awareness of the general Miao people was raised, they gradually approached the People's Government, and the divisions between ethnic groups were gradually eliminated. The first thing that made the Miao people happy was that now, regardless of Miao or Han, the Miao people could walk proudly on the streets without having to guard against the unreasonable insults of the reactionary ruling class.
    Now, peasant associations have been established in all bao of Xinping Township, and some bao have implemented rent reduction. The poor Miao people, having understood the rent reduction policy, have improved their enthusiasm for production. A blacksmith in the first bao, who never used to farm, has now, after understanding the government's production policy, also taken the time to plant three mu of land this year.

　　乾城新坪乡的苗族人民
    李经　李德震
    湘西的乾城县，共有三万苗族人民，占全县总人口的百分之三十。苗民最多的新坪乡，全乡五千左右人口中，苗民占百分之九十八。新坪乡接近凤凰和永绥、是山多田少的地区。绝大多数苗民都是“白耕夜织”，过着勤劳而艰苦的生活。苗民中地主、富农人数非常少。如第一保共有一百八十户，苗民中只有三户富农，没有地主，而贫雇农占一百十八户。
            “屯田”的血泪史
    在过去，苗民受着最残酷的封建压迫。
    给苗民痛苦最大的要算是“屯田”制。远在满清嘉庆年间，这里的苗民因忍受不了当时的封建压迫，曾掀起革命运动。满清政府派大军把革命镇压下去了，并将起义苗民的稻田全部没收，叫做，“丈田入公”，被掠夺的耕地叫做“屯田”。统治者更采用了“以苗治苗”的毒计，招收一部分苗民中的无业游民，组织“苗兵”，以长期镇压苗民。设“屯仓”，收“屯租”来维持军食。
    屯田分为两种，一种叫“屯租田”；另一种是从屯田中抽出的一部分好田，叫做“屯长田”。屯租田按官收七成，民留三成交租，叫做“君七留三”。屯长田则是佃户与屯长（管仓官——汉人）对分。国民党统治时期，曾在一九四五年实行所谓“土地陈报”，名义上是把屯田和屯长田“发还苗民”；实际上，苗民仍旧要按田亩面积交纳大部分收获给伪政府；而且丈田时伪政府故意扩大一般苗民耕地的面积数字，把一亩丈成二亩，更加重了苗民的负担。同时，恶霸们又借丈田机会侵占苗民耕地，如伪屯长熊少田、舒雅琴、田瑞丰、王悦誉四人，就强占了“屯长田”六十亩，不肯发还原耕苗民。
            残酷的封建压迫
    一般地主出租土地的租额也不比“屯田”低，而且屯长、地主们时常还要佃户替他们做“白工”。做“白工”不但没有工钱，甚至连饭都吃不饱。地主们叫白工时不管佃户的忙闲，一律要按时赶快去。否则就给佃户以各种侮辱，还要“提田”（收回耕地）。另外，每年秋收时，佃户还要请地主、屯长来分谷。这时，佃户必须具备酒肉款待地主，否则就有被夺去耕地的危险。
    高利贷也是一种很严重的剥削。这里，往往有住在乾城城内的地主或富地的地主、富农们，在春季贷出一部分粮食，到秋收要半倍到一倍的利息。尤其在国民党统治时期，伪币不断贬值，地主贷出伪币，到秋后就要以实物偿还。如第一保陈义的妻子，在一九四○年向地主陈景尧借了八百元，折成稻谷四石八斗。当年秋天还了五石还没还清。两年之后，陈义家被迫将田地卖给债主，地价只有三千一百元，竟被扣去借钱利息二千三百元。
    国民党的抓壮丁与苛捐杂税给苗民的痛苦更大。如关石一家四个儿子，三个能够作工的都被国民党抓出当兵了。平常一个中农的家庭，每年平均要出“子弹捐”、“枪支捐”、“自卫费”、“乡保捐”等等负担约四百斤大米；一户贫农也要出一百斤到二百斤。
    在政治上，反动统治者们更轻视苗民，把他们称为“苗子”；同时，统治阶级故意制造汉、苗之间的隔阂，许多苗民终生不敢进城。
    除了经济上、政治上受压迫而外，苗民在文化上也是受压迫的。现在苗民中识字的人很少。迷信很深。有病多不用医药而用“吃牛”、“还愿”等迷信方法来“治”。每一次杀牛、杀猪，招集许多人大吃大喝好多天，浪费很大。
            苗族人民抬头了
    解放以后，由于反动统治阶级长期间留在苗民中的影响，最初有一部分苗民对共产党和人民政府还有些怀疑。但是，人民政府正确的民族政策和解放军优良的群众纪律，很快就在苗民中发生了巨大的影响。一般苗族人民大众的觉悟提高了，他们逐渐地接近了人民政府，民族间的隔阂也逐步消除了。苗民第一个感到高兴的，就是现在不分苗、汉，苗民可以在大街上抬头挺胸走路，不用再提防反动统治阶级的无理侮辱了。
    现在，新坪乡各保都成立了农民协会，有的保已实行了减租。贫苦的苗民知道了减租政策，生产情绪提高了。第一保一个铁匠，过去从不种地的，在懂得了政府的生产政策之后，他今年也抽出时间种了三亩地。
