How to Promote the Cooperative Contract System
A Summary of Experience in the Northeast Region Over the Past Year
Zang Xiaozhen

I

In the Northeast region, the cooperative contract system began in Heilongjiang last summer and was soon adopted by various provinces to varying degrees and within different scopes. It played a certain role in last winter's sideline production, grain purchase, production and disaster relief, and the promotion of general merchandise. In Heilongjiang Province alone, in the first quarter of 1950, cooperatives signed 12,282 contracts with state-owned commercial enterprises, with a total transaction value of 923.9 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 70% of the province's total cooperative transactions.

In the process of adopting the contract system over the past year, the following characteristics have emerged:

In the initial trial phase, most contracts started with a specific matter and were "direct contracts" (or "execution contracts") signed directly by the obligor - the district, village, and cooperative with the trade organization, or the village and cooperative with the producer. The county cooperative played an assisting role and was not included in the contractual relationship. In terms of contract content, there were procurement contracts, exchange contracts, pre-purchase contracts (some called credit contracts), etc., mostly materials that the masses urgently needed for autumn harvest, winter clothing, and that the state required. The above contracts were all simple and easy-to-implement direct contracts. This was the basic form for establishing contractual relationships in the early stages.

During the winter, a large-scale, organized mobilization of the masses for sideline production and the state's large-scale grain purchases, that is, during the peak season of commodity circulation, the contract system was extensively promoted. In order to facilitate the control of market prices and guide the sideline production of small farmers towards organized and planned operations, in addition to the original direct contracts, a partially comprehensive contract (or general contract) with organizational and planning features emerged. The soil alkali production and sales contract signed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Cooperative and the Provincial State-owned Caustic Soda Factory was one such example. The contract stipulated that the Provincial Cooperative would supply the caustic soda factory with 2 million catties of soil alkali per month, and the caustic soda factory would pay the Provincial Cooperative 152,000 catties of 96-degree caustic soda. The Provincial Cooperative would then, according to the requirements of the contract, notify soil alkali producing counties, districts, and village cooperatives such as Anguang and Tao'an, which would then sign direct contracts with producers. It was estimated that this would increase farmers' income by 10,000 tons of grain annually, while the caustic soda factory would reduce its procurement staff by 15 to 20 people and lower costs by 7.5%. In grain purchase, some county cooperatives also signed phased procurement partially comprehensive contracts with the county grain companies. Although the contractual relationship in this period improved on the original basis, it did not go beyond the scope of procurement and was mainly for the procurement of sideline products and grain.

With the formulation and issuance of the Northeast People's Government's trade plan for 1950, the Jilin Provincial Department of Commerce and the Provincial Cooperative first created a planned contract (i.e., a general contract) for the promotion of general merchandise and the procurement of local and sideline products. The Northeast Cooperative Headquarters proactively negotiated with the Northeast Trade Department to draft an instructive contract between the state and cooperatives in the entire Northeast region, which was a contract with policy guidance, strengthening the principles and enhancing the organization of the state trade plan within both systems, further improving the correct organization of supply and marketing, and laying the foundation for direct executors of state and cooperatives—provincial, municipal, county companies and all levels of cooperatives—to sign partially comprehensive and direct contracts, and strengthening their sense of responsibility for signing contracts.

From the year's exploration process, the contract's scope was gradually expanded from the bottom up, enhancing the contract's role until the signing of the instructive contract, which has initially formed a series of supply and marketing systems. In the future, it is necessary to connect from top to bottom and from bottom to top, to consolidate the contract system deeply into the actual supply and marketing relationship.

The above is a brief overview of the promotion of the contract system over the past year.

II

What role has the cooperative contract system played in economic development?

1.  The contract system is a link connecting the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, and the individual economy, and is a new form of commodity circulation between urban and rural areas. Today, our agricultural economy is still an individual economy with extreme dispersion. The best way to overcome this dispersion is to organize it through cooperatives. With cooperatives, a contract system must also be added to plan the supply of industrial products from state-owned enterprises to rural areas and the supply of agricultural and sideline products from rural areas to state-owned enterprises; to include individual small farmers within our national plan in a certain scope of production and consumption; and to more closely connect cities and villages, industry and agriculture. The experience of Heilongjiang Province fully proves this point. In that province, state-owned commerce promoted general merchandise through cooperatives, accounting for 35% of the total promotion in the fourth quarter of last year, and increasing to 43% in the first quarter of this year; grain purchases accounted for 31% of the total purchase in the fourth quarter of last year, and increased to 45% in the first quarter of this year; local product purchases accounted for 30% of the total purchase in the fourth quarter of last year, and increased to 50% in the first quarter of this year. The rapid increase is worthy of attention. This proves that as long as we master this new weapon—the contract system—not only will the connection between the state economy and individual farmers become closer, but it will also promote the development of cooperatives—expanding business, developing members, increasing capital, and enhancing the role that cooperatives play in organizing the individual farmer economy.

2.  The contract system is a powerful weapon for fighting to complete the national economic plan and must serve the plan. The soil alkali production and sales contract in Heilongjiang, as well as the widely implemented procurement contracts for local and sideline products and grain purchase contracts, are all concrete steps to combine with the production movement of the broad masses of small farmers and to guide and organize the individual economy to move towards a planned economy. The general contract for the purchase and sale plan of the Jilin Provincial Department of Commerce and the Provincial Cooperative for the first quarter of 1950 is a specific embodiment of the national trade plan task. It defines the proportion, variety, and quantity of purchases and sales that state and cooperatives should bear, and determines the methods of fulfilling the obligations of both parties, and finally stipulates the material responsibilities that either party should bear if it fails to fulfill the contractual obligations, thus providing a material guarantee for the plan. These practical experiences tell us that contracts and plans are unified and inseparable. At present, our plan is still like a newborn baby, not so strong, and it is impossible to make a perfect plan all at once. So, in today's extensive implementation of the contract system is the best way to promote and strengthen the plan. But when the plan has been formulated, the contract system becomes a guarantee for the realization of the plan.

3.  The contract system is the material basis for organizing commodities, controlling market prices, and reducing intermediate exploitation. In recent years, inland waterways have been open throughout the country, and the market has expanded, not only developing urban-rural mutual assistance but also starting domestic and foreign exchanges. Therefore, the commodity production of small farmers has also increased with the needs of the market. It is necessary to organize separately what is self-sufficient in rural areas, what is supplied to cities and industries, and what is supplied to national foreign trade. At the same time, due to the recovery and development of the national economy, the people's living standards are increasing day by day, and their relationship with the market is becoming closer. Under this new situation, the contract system has become a sharp weapon in mastering the market, controlling prices, organizing commodity circulation, protecting the interests of the people, developing public and private production, and preventing speculators from taking advantage of loopholes in actual economic relations. For example, the grain purchase in Acheng County, Songjiang Province, the order for large carts in Suihua, Heilongjiang, and the procurement contracts for local and sideline products in other provinces and counties, not only closely connected the relationship between state and cooperatives, but more importantly, public and private enterprises directly exchanged with small farmers through cooperatives, got rid of market exploitation, and solved the needs of the people. That is to say, we not only sign contracts with state-owned enterprises and small farmers but also sign contracts with private enterprises. When the contract is combined with the masses and becomes an organized action, it gradually reduces the role of blindly pursuing the market and reduces intermediate exploitation; at the same time, it educates the masses with actual economic benefits and points out the direction for producers and consumers.

4.  The contract system is an effective tool for promoting economic accounting and improving management methods. In the past year, all cooperatives that have correctly fulfilled the contract have been learning to be careful in planning and calculating, actively paying more attention to specifications, prices, time, and technology, and strengthening their sense of responsibility; at the same time, they have begun to plan for capital turnover and capital use; they have begun to supply and purchase according to the needs of the people, and the phenomenon of stockpiling unsalable goods has basically disappeared; the shortcomings of commodity interruption have been improved, and the solution to the needs of the people is more timely. For example, the total amount of capital of cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province increased by 63% in the first quarter of this year compared with the end of last year, and the capital turnover of individual village cooperatives averaged 11 times per month. On the one hand, this is due to the combination and assistance of the national economy, and on the other hand, it comes from the improvement of the management methods of the cooperatives themselves. For example, after the Hunchun County, Jilin signed a contract for the promotion of general merchandise, the district and village cooperatives organized 40 units of stalls and peddlers. At the same time, due to the fulfillment of the contract, the management ability of the cadres has been improved, and they have initially made plans.

5.  The contract system is a huge force to guarantee, stimulate, and accelerate the development of the national economy. In recent years, the implemented grain purchase contracts, pre-purchase contracts for cotton, hemp, and tobacco, order contracts (or promotion contracts) for production tools and local and sideline products, and processing contracts for grain, leather, and grain have all shown the role of guaranteeing, stimulating production, and developing production. The quality of products is improving, and the variety is increasing. For small farmers: "With the contract signed, there is a grip on leading production," cash crops have a direction, soybeans are to be planted with "full warehouses of gold," cotton recognizes "Guan Nong No. 1," and wheat is to be planted with "Kehua"; handicraft sideline production has a relatively fixed object. In the supply of cooperatives, the main necessities such as oil, salt, and cloth are not enough. The people's request is to increase fine cloth, colored cloth, and floral cloth in addition to liberation cloth, wood and wire nails used in construction, and more stationery is needed. The people in Yanji area even demand sewing machines, foreign wellheads, and floral silk. These not only show the combination of agriculture and industry, and the combination with the international market, but also provide state-owned production enterprises with the need to combine with the needs of consumers. This is the actual economic life indicating the direction of production and discovering the potential production capacity of the masses and the potential resources that the state can utilize. As long as there is a guarantee of the contract, it can stimulate and improve the production mood, carry out production in large quantities, and directly promote the improvement of product quality in mutual supervision. This is the great organizational role of the contract system.

It can be seen that: "Planned contracts, economic accounting, all of these are unified." At the same time, the contract must serve the plan, serve the economic accounting system, and serve the struggle to obtain excellent quality and increase the variety of products, to ensure compliance with the supply time of goods, and to accelerate capital turnover and capital accumulation.

III

Although the above benefits have been experienced in the implementation of the contract system in recent years, there are still serious problems that cannot be ignored in the fulfillment process.

First, even today, some cooperatives still neglect contracts and do not sign contracts. They "hate trouble," fear "restrictions," or have other concerns, and still follow the old practice of blind supply and marketing, keeping stalls, and making no progress, or even eating away after selling on credit; or rushing around to "make a fortune," resulting in a backlog of unsalable goods and poor turnover. These irrational phenomena are still the individual farmer thinking at work in the cooperative, not understanding that our economy is moving towards the direction of planning, and not understanding that the contract system is a main method to ensure the realization of the economic plan.

Second, blindly signing contracts, signing large contracts, the content is general, the responsibility is unclear, the contracts are large and useless, there are also some "one-sided contracts" (not taking care of the other party), and some are shouting slogans for contracts, or signing contracts for the sake of contracts. These are only empty forms and have never had any practical significance.

Third, there are also so-called "task" contracts and "allocated" contracts. The former mostly occurs in disaster areas, the administration and the masses sign, and then order the cooperative to implement, only shouting for help, but without any cost accounting, so that the cooperative "suppresses the capital and loses the market." The latter is mostly that cooperatives or state-owned stores are eager to purchase or promote, without publicity, without consultation, and force allocation, or directly violate the interests of the masses, or freeze the capital of the cooperative. Both directly and indirectly hinder the development of normal supply and marketing business.

Fourth, the serious shortcomings in the fulfillment of the contract are the relaxation of contract discipline. Some people abandon the contract halfway, some people do not fulfill the terms of the contract, and some people do not settle on time. These are related to the parties or one party directly fulfilling the contract and mostly have the nature of "consciously" violating the contract. This not only affects the relationship between the two parties, leaves a very bad impression on the masses, and seriously hinders the promotion of the contract system.

Although the above are occasional, some are self-defeating in credit. But the main reason is, on the one hand, that lower-level cooperatives lack sensitivity to new affairs, do not study, and do not try to do it, so they fail to promote it normally and universally; on the other hand, the main reason is that the leading cooperatives fail to check in time, find problems, and solve difficulties. For the beneficial experiences that have already appeared, they lack timely and specific research, and have not carried out systematic comprehensive summaries, so that the advantages have not been developed, and the shortcomings have not been overcome in time.

IV

In the future, to sign contracts that conform to the actual situation and can play a correct role in organizing supply and marketing, we should seriously do the following:

1.  Before signing a contract, we must do very important preparatory work. That is, conduct serious investigation and research, and accurately grasp what is produced there, what is needed there, which products have a wide sales market, and should be developed in large quantities, and which products have a limited or no sales market, so we should develop less or temporarily stop production. Grasp the production and sales season and historical situation, and be familiar with the "ins and outs" of various production processes. This will not only adapt to the current situation, but also discover new potential resources, and increase the wealth of the country and the wealth of the masses. This is the responsible attitude and material preparation for signing a contract.

2.  The terms of the contract must be specific, clear, and with clear responsibilities. A relatively complete contract needs to clearly stipulate the variety, specification, quantity, price, packaging, storage, reduction, transportation burden, delivery time, place, tax burden, settlement method, person in charge of execution, and liability for losses due to natural disasters, as well as the material guarantee when the contract cannot be fulfilled. At the same time, both parties who sign and fulfill the direct contract must be economic accounting units, and must be built on the basis of voluntary and mutual benefit. Only in this way can the realization of the contract be guaranteed.

3.  Once the contract is signed, it immediately becomes a valid document, and we must keep our promises, supervise each other, and strictly fulfill it, and regard it as a regulation that both parties must abide by. Unilateral abandonment of the contract must bear legal liability for property. At present, in order to supplement the lack of experience, it is still appropriate to sign short-term small contracts.

4.  Regularly checking the implementation of the contract is the most important task to ensure the realization of the contract. The key to the deviations that have occurred in the contract relationship in recent years lies in the lack of inspection. To ensure the dignity of the contract, the leading agency should regularly check the following situations: How is the actual implementation of the terms stipulated in the contract? Whether the fixed quantity of materials is supplied within the stipulated period? Whether the seller guarantees the quality and variety? Whether the buyer pays on time? What unexpected problems are encountered in the fulfillment of the contract, etc., and solve the problems in the process of fulfilling the contract in time. And study the existing experience to make it as reasonable as possible. "Heilongjiang's simple summary and future opinions on production and sales contracts," "Hunchun County Cooperative's experience in promoting the contract system in the past six months," etc., this is a very important leadership method.

5.  Expand the scope of the contract, order goods directly from state-owned production enterprises, and undertake the procurement of some of their industrial raw materials. In recent years, the scope of signing contracts has expanded from the purchase of grain, local and sideline products to the promotion of general merchandise, and production tools have been ordered from private production enterprises. The latter contractual relationship allows private enterprises and farmers to meet each other, reducing intermediate procedures and improving product quality. This experience should be promoted so that cooperatives and state-owned production enterprises can directly sign order contracts, or exchange contracts for industrial raw materials and industrial products, which also reduces intermediate procedures and directly reflects the needs of the masses to state-owned production enterprises in order to improve quality and increase variety; tell farmers the country's requirements for raw materials in order to stimulate the improvement of farmers' production.

6.  The lessons of recent years have indeed made it necessary to establish an arbitration or mediation agency to supplement the lack of consultation by the leading agencies of both parties. In the fulfillment and signing of contracts, many disputes have occurred between the two parties, and even some important issues have been delayed for a long time, hanging unresolved, affecting the financial affairs of both parties, and seriously hindering the signing of contracts, and promoting the failure to fulfill contractual obligations. Therefore, whether in strengthening and consolidating contract discipline, or in solving existing problems, the key lies in the active promotion of the contract system, and there is an urgent need to establish an effective arbitration or mediation agency. So that it can use all its activities to actively help various enterprises and agencies to fight for the correct organization of supply and marketing and for the completion of national plans.

　　怎样推行合作社的合同制
    一年来东北区的经验总结
    臧晓真
    一
    合同制在东北区合作社，去夏开始于黑龙江，不久即在不同程度与不同范围内为各省所采用。它在去年冬季副业生产、购粮、生产救灾以及推销百货中，都起了一定的作用。仅黑龙江一省，一九五○年第一季度，合作社与国营商业之间即签订合同一二、二八二次，交易总额达九、二三九亿元，占全省合作社交易总额百分之七十左右。
    在一年来采用合同制的过程中，综合起来，有以下特点：
    在开始试行当中，大都是从一件具体的事情开始的，并且是由义务履行者——区村社同贸易机关或村社与生产者——直接签订的“直接合同”（或叫执行合同）。县社处于帮助地位，不包括于合同关系以内。在合同内容上看，有采购合同、交换合同、预购合同（有的叫赊欠合同）等，大都为群众急于准备秋收，冬装，又为国家所需之资料。以上合同悉属简而易行之直接合同。这是初期建立合同关系的基本形式。
    冬季大规模有组织的发动群众副业生产，与国家大量收购粮食中，亦即商品周转旺盛季节，大量推广了合同制。为了便于掌握市场物价，并引导农民小生产者的副业生产走向有组织有计划的进行，除原有之直接合同外，又出现了富于组织性与计划性的局部合同（或总合同）。黑龙江省社与省营火碱厂签订的土碱产销合同，就是其中之一。该合同规定省社按月供给火碱厂土碱二百万斤，火碱厂付省社九十六度火碱十五万二千斤。省社则根据合同要求，通知土碱产地安广、洮安等县、区、村社，再向生产者签订直接合同。估计全年可使农民增加收入一万吨粮食，火碱厂则可减少十五至二十名采购人员。降低成本百分之七·五。在购粮当中，部分县社也与县粮食公司间签订了分期采购的局部合同。这一时期的合同关系，虽在原有的基础上提高了一步，但未超出采购范围，且主要为副业产品与粮食之采购。
    随着一九五○年东北区人民政府贸易计划的制定与下达，吉林省商业厅与省社首创百货推销与土副产品采购的计划合同（即总合同）。东北合作总社主动的与东北贸易部协议，草拟全东北国合之间的指示合同，即具有政策指示性的合同，将国家贸易计划，在双方整个系统内，加强其原则性，提高其组织性，使正确的组织供销提高一步，并奠定了国合双方直接执行者——省、市、县、公司与各级社——签订局部合同、直接合同的基础，并加强其对签订合同的责任心。
    从一年来的摸索过程，首先是自下而上的逐步扩大着合同的范围，提高着合同的作用，直至指示合同的签订，已初步形成了一系列的供销制度。今后要自上而下、自下而上，相互衔接起来，把合同制巩固的深入到实际供销关系中去。
    以上就是一年来推行合同制的梗概。
    二
    合作社推行合同制，在经济发展中起了些什么作用呢？
    １、合同制是国营经济与合作社经济以及个体经济相互结合的纽带，是城乡间商品周转的新形式。今天我们的农业经济，还是个体经济，有极大的散漫性。克服这种散漫性的最好办法，就是通过合作社把它组织起来。有了合作社还必须再加上合同制，才可能有计划的把国营企业的工业品供给乡村，乡村的农副产品供给国家企业；才可能把个体的农民小生产者在一定生产消费范围内纳入我们的国家计划以内，才可能将城市和乡村，工业和农业更密切的结合起来。黑龙江省的经验，充分的证明了这一点。该省国营商业，通过合作社推销百货，去年第四季度占总推销额百分之三十五，今年第一季度则提高到百分之四十三；采购粮食，去年第四季度占采购总额百分之三十一，今年第一季度则提高到百分之四十五；采购土产，去年第四季度占采购总额百分之三十，今年第一季度则提高到百分之五十。其增涨速度之快，是十分值得注意的。这证明只要掌握了这个新的武器——合同制之后，不仅国家经济与个体农民的联系日益密切，而且同时促进着合作社的发展——扩大了业务，发展了社员，增加了资金，并提高了合作社在组织个体农民经济中所发挥的作用。
    ２、合同制是为完成国家经济计划而斗争的有力武器，又必须为计划而服务。黑龙江的土碱产销合同，以及普遍实行的土副产品的采购合同与购粮合同等，都是和广大农民小生产者的生产运动相结合、并引导组织个体经济向着计划经济走的具体步骤。吉林省商业厅、省总社签订的一九五○年第一季度购销计划总合同，就是国家贸易计划任务的具体化。它根据国家贸易计划任务，规定了国合各自所应负担采购与推销的比例、品种、数量，并确定了双方义务的履行方法，最后还规定了任何一方不能履行合同义务时所应负担的物质责任，如此则给计划以物质保证。从这些实际经验中告诉我们合同与计划是统一的，不可分的。在目前我们的计划还像初生的婴儿，不是那样健壮，也不可能一下子做出十全十美的计划来。那么在今天多方的实行合同制，就是促进和加强计划的最好办法。但当计划既已制定，那么合同制就变为计划实现的保证书。
    ３、合同制是组织商品，掌握市场物价，减免中间剥削的物质基础。年来全国内地水陆畅通，市场扩大，不仅发展着城乡互助，而且开始了内外交流。因此农民小生产者的商品生产也就随着市场的需要而增加。什么是农村自给自足的，什么是供给城市及工业的，什么是供给国家对外贸易的，均须分别加以组织。同时由于国民经济的恢复与发展，群众生活日益提高，于是对市场的关系亦日益密切。在此新情况下，合同制在掌握市场，掌握物价，组织商品的周转与保护群众利益，发展公私生产，以及防止投机商人钻空子等实际经济关系中，就成了一支锐利的武器。比如松江省阿城县的购粮，黑龙江绥化的订购大车以及其他省县的采购土副产品等合同，不仅是密切了国合关系，更重要的是公私企业通过合作社，直接同农民小生产者进行了交换，摆脱了市场剥削，解决了群众需要。这就是说，我们不仅同国家企业订合同，与农民小生产者订合同，也要同私人企业订合同，当合同一旦与群众相结合，变为有组织的行动时，就逐渐降低着盲目追逐市场的作用，减免了中间剥削；同时以实际的经济利益教育了群众，并给生产者消费者指出了方向。
    ４、合同制是促进经济核算制，改善经营方法的有效工具。一年来举凡正确履行了合同的合作社，都在学习着精打细算，主动的对于规格、价格、时间、技术等问题更加重视了，并加强了责任心；同时对资金周转，资金使用上开始有了计划；开始按着群众需要供应与采购，积压冷货的现象基本上绝迹；商品中断的缺陷有改善，解决群众需要比较及时了。比如黑龙江全省合作社的资金总额，今年第一季度较去年底增加了百分之六十三，个别村社的资金周转每月平均达十一次。这一方面是由于国家经济的结合与扶助，另一方面则来自合作社本身经营方法的改善。比如吉林珲春县签订百货推销合同之后，各区村合作社即组织摊床，货郎四十个单位。同时由于合同的履行，干部的经营能力是提高了，并初步有了计划。
    ５、合同制是保证、刺激、加速国民经济发展的巨大力量。年来实行的购粮合同，棉麻烟草的预购合同，生产工具，土副产品的订货合同（或推销合同），粮谷皮革的加工合同等，都显示着保证，刺激生产、发展生产的作用。产品的质量在提高，种类在增加。在农民小生产者来说：“订了合同，领导生产有抓手了”，商品作物有了方向，大豆要种“满仓金”，棉花认准“关农一号”，小麦要种“克华”；手工业副业生产有了比较固定的对象。在合作社的供应上，主要的油盐布等必需品已经不够了。群众的要求是解放布之外需增加细布、色布、花布，修建上用的木材、洋钉，文具品的需要增多，延吉地区的群众甚至要求洋针（缝衣机）洋井头，花绸子等。这些不仅显示出农业与工业的结合，与国际市场结合，更提供给国营生产企业必须与消费者的需要相结合。这就是实际的经济生活指示着生产的方向，发掘着群众潜在的生产能力与国家可能利用的潜在资源。只要有了合同的保证，就能刺激并提高生产情绪，大量去进行生产，在相互监督中又直接促进着产品质量的提高，这就是合同制的伟大组织作用。
    由此可见：“计划合同，经济核算制，所有这一切都是统一的。”同时，合同必须服务于计划，服务于经济核算制，服务于为获得产品的优良品质和品种的增加，为确实遵守商品的供应时间，为加速资金周转以及资金积累等而进行斗争。
    三
    虽然在年来实行合同制度中体验到以上好处，但在履行过程中尚存在着不容忽视的严重问题。
    第一是在今天仍有些合作社忽视合同，不订合同。他们“嫌麻烦”，怕“限制”，或者存在着其他顾虑，依然是老一套的盲目供销，守摊子、无起色，甚至赊完吃垮；或则到处乱闯“捞一把”，以致积压冷货，周转不灵。这些不合理现象，仍是合作社工作中，个体农民思想在作祟，还不懂得我们的经济是朝着计划的方向走，不懂得合同制是保证经济计划实现的一个主要方法。
    第二是盲目的签订合同，订大合同，内容笼统，责任不明，大而无当，还有什么“一面合同”（不照顾对方），也有的在空喊合同，或为合同而订合同等。这些仅是空具形式，从未发生过任何实际意义。
    第三，还有所谓之“任务”合同、“摊派”合同。前者大都发生于灾区，行政与群众签订，然后命令合作社执行，只喊救命，而毫无成本核算，以致合作社“压住了资金，失掉市场”。后者大部是合作社或国营商店急于采购或推销，不宣传、不商量、强迫摊派，或者直接违害了群众利益，或者冻结了合作社的资金。都直接间接的障碍着正常供销业务的发展。
    第四、在履行合同中所发生的严重缺点是合同纪律的松弛。中途废约者有之，不履行合同条款者有之，不按期结算者亦有之。这些都是属于合同直接履行者双方或一方有关者，大都带有“有意识”违犯的性质。如此不仅影响了双方关系，给群众留下了很坏的印象，并严重阻碍合同制的推广。
    以上种种虽则有的事出偶然。有的是自失信用。但其主要原因，一方面来自下级社对新鲜事务缺乏敏感，不钻研，不试办，以致未能正常的普遍推行；另一方面主要的是领导社未能及时检查，发现问题，解决困难，对于已经出现的有益的经验，缺乏及时的具体研究，未进行系统的综合总结，以致优点未能得到发扬，缺点未能及时克服。
    四
    今后要签订符合于实际的，能够起正确组织供销作用的合同。应认真做到：
    １、在签定合同之前，须做极重要的准备工作。即认真的调查研究，确切掌握那里出产什么，那里需要什么，那些产品销路广，应该大量发展，那些产品销路有限或无销路，就少发展或暂时停止生产。掌握产销季节与历史情况，熟悉各项生产的“来龙去脉”。如此则不仅能适应目前，而且能发掘新的潜在资源，增加国家财富与群众财富。这就是签订合同的负责态度与物质准备。
    ２、合同条款一定要具体、明确，责任分明。比较完整的合同。需要明确规定品种，规格，数量，价格，包装，保管，减量，运输负担，交货时间，地点，税务负担，结算办法，执行负责人与天灾人祸之损失责任，以及不能履行合同时的物质保证等。同时直接合同的签定与履行者，双方均必须是经济核算单位，并且要建筑在双方的自愿与互利的基础上，只有如此才能保证合同的实现。
    ３、合同既经签订，则立即成为有效的文件，必须互守信用，相互监督，严格履行，把它看成双方必须遵守的法规。单方废约必须负担财产上的法律责任。在目前为了补助经验之不足，仍以签订短期的小型合同为宜。
    ４、经常检查合同的执行情况是保证合同实现的最主要任务。年来合同关系上所发生的偏差，关键在于缺少检查。为保证合同的尊严，领导机关应经常检查下列情形：合同中规定条款实际执行的情况怎样？是否按规定期间供应了定量物资？卖主是否保证了质量，品种？买主是否按期付款？在合同履行中碰到什么意外问题等等，并及时解决履行合同过程中的问题。并把已经存在的经验，进行研究，使之尽量合理化。像“黑龙江关于产销合同的简单总结和今后意见”，“珲春县社半年来推行合同制的经验”等，这是一种十分重要的领导方法。
    ５、扩大合同范围，向国营生产企业直接订货，并承担其部分工业原料的采购。年来签订合同的范围已由粮食土副产产品的采购扩大到百货推销，并同私营生产企业订购了生产工具。后一种合同关系使私营企业与农民见了面减少了中间手续，提高了产品质量。此经验应予推广，使合作社与国营生产企业直接签订定货合同，或工业原料与工业产品的交换合同，同样减少中间手续，把群众的要求直接反映给国营生产企业，以提高质量增加品种；将国家对原料的要求告诉农民，以刺激农民生产的改进。
    ６、年来的教训，确有成立仲裁机构或调停机构之必要，以补双方领导机构协商之不足。在履行与签订合同中，双方发生许多争执，甚至一些重要问题，长期拖延，悬而不决，影响双方财务业务，并严重的障碍着合同的签订，助长了不按合同履行义务。因此无论在加强与巩固合同纪律上，或解决现存问题上，主要在于合同制之积极推广，急须设立有效的仲裁或调停机构。使其运用自己的全部活动，积极的帮助各企业机关为正确组织供销，为完成国家计划而斗争。
