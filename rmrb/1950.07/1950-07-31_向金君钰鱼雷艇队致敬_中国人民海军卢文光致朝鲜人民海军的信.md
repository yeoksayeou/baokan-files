To the esteemed Captain Kim Kun-ok, Commander Li Zong-gen, and all comrades of the Kim Kun-ok Torpedo Boat Team:

I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Navy. The glorious achievements you have created for your dignified homeland have deeply moved, inspired, and educated me. With the abundant belief that the Korean people will surely win, I extend my highest respect to you—the heroes of the Korean people. I write to you with trembling hands to establish contact, to learn from you, and to emulate you.

Our brilliant leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, has long pointed out to the people of the world: "American imperialism is a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality." This paper tiger has already been pierced by our people in the four years of the victorious Liberation War, and now you have peeled off its skin. No matter how great a price American imperialism continues to pay in its vain attempt to trample on your beautiful land, and no matter what "Seventh" or "Eighth" Fleets it uses to obstruct our liberation of the territory of the People's Republic of China—Taiwan—in the end, its intimidating facade will inevitably be torn to shreds by us.

The incomparably brave people's armies of China and Korea have already demonstrated invincible strength in the struggle to achieve national independence and prosperity, and the people's freedom and happiness. The source of this strength is beyond the exploration of American imperialist elements; the invincibility of this strength is also beyond their comprehension. But we understand it very clearly.

In the battle to liberate Hainan Island, we once created the miracle of defeating warships with wooden boats. In the most critical situation, Political Instructor He Shaofu said to the soldiers: "Communists have no difficulties that cannot be overcome." Deputy Platoon Leader Lu Xiangyun loudly called out: "Now is a life-or-death struggle; it's either you die or I live." And a platoon leader comrade on the No. 5 warship, pinned under a collapsed awning with broken ropes, still shouted: "Comrades, fight! Fight even if the water is up to your heads!" This, like Li Wan-gen's cry of "Comrades! Charge bravely!" when only 800 meters away from the enemy ship in creating the great feat of sinking an American cruiser, is the courage to overwhelm all enemies. This courage is what Kim Kun-ok called the "selfless courage" "displayed" "for the motherland and the people."

"The sympathy of the broad masses of people around the world stands on the side of the invaded." Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out another source of our and your inevitable victory. Communist parties, the working class, and the broad masses of people in all countries around the world—including the American Communist Party, the working class, and the broad masses of people—unanimously oppose the aggressive actions of American imperialism and are actively supporting you. Your most beloved leader, our close friend General Kim Il-sung, who fought alongside us to defeat Japanese fascism, has also pointed out: "We have obtained the enthusiastic response and sympathy of the freedom-loving people of the world."

The direct armed intervention of American imperialists can only add some difficulties to your liberation of all your territory and our final liberation of Taiwan, but it cannot prevent us from seizing victory. If the American imperialist Seventh Fleet dares to fire the first shot at our army liberating Taiwan, we will certainly teach them a severe lesson—just as you once taught them in the territorial waters of Korea.

Comrades! Let us advance shoulder to shoulder in the battle to expel American armed interventionists, in the struggle to defend world peace!

I extend my congratulations to you on receiving the honors of the motherland's medals, and I wish you victory after victory until all American armed interventionists are expelled from the country.

### 向金君钰鱼雷艇队致敬  中国人民海军卢文光致朝鲜人民海军的信

　　向金君钰鱼雷艇队致敬
    中国人民海军卢文光致朝鲜人民海军的信敬爱的金君钰队长、李宗根艇长，金君钰鱼雷艇队全体同志们：
    我是中国人民海军的战士。你们为自己的尊严的祖国所创立的光荣的伟绩，深深地感动了我、鼓舞了我、教育了我。我怀着朝鲜人民必胜的充沛的信念，向你们——朝鲜人民的英雄致最崇高的敬意。我以激动得发抖的手给你们写信，是为了和你们建立联系，以便向你们学习，向你们看齐。
    我们的天才的领袖毛泽东主席，早经向全世界人民指出过：“美帝国主义是只外强中干的纸老虎。”这只纸老虎，已经为我国人民在四年的胜利的解放战争中戳破过，而现在又为你们揭开了它的皮。不管美帝国主义继续付出多大的代价妄想蹂躏你们的锦绣的山河，也不管他用什么“第七”“第八”舰队来阻挠我们解放中华人民共和国的领土——台湾，最后，他的那张借以吓人的花纸必然要被我们撕得粉碎。
    无比英勇的中朝两国的人民军队，在争取祖国独立富强、人民自由幸福的战斗中，已经表现了无敌的力量。这力量的源泉，是美国帝国主义分子无法探索的；这力量的不可战胜，也是他们无法理解的。但是我们却了解得很清楚。
    在解放海南岛的战斗中，我们曾经创造了以木船打败军舰的奇迹。在情况最严重的时候，政治指导员何绍甫同志对战士们说：“共产党员没有克服不了的困难。”副排长卢相云同志则响亮地号召：“现在是生死斗争，不是你死就是我活。”而第五号战船上的一位排长同志，被压在断了绳索的篷下仍然高喊：“同志们打呀！水不淹头顶就要打呀！”这和你们在创造击沉美国巡洋舰的伟绩中，当距离敌舰只有八百米远时，李完根同志所呼喊的“同志们！勇敢的冲吧！”同是足以压倒一切敌人的勇气。这勇气就是金君钰同志所说的“为了祖国和人民”而“发挥”的“忘我的勇敢精神”。
    “全世界广大人民的同情，都站在被侵略者方面。”毛泽东主席这样指出了我们和你们必然赢得胜利的另一个根源。全世界各国共产党，工人阶级和广大人民——连同美国共产党、工人阶级和广大人民在内，都一致反对美帝国主义的侵略行动，都在积极声援你们。你们最敬爱的领袖、和我们并肩作战打败了日本法西斯的我们的亲密的朋友——金日成将军也已指出：“我们已获得了世界爱好自由人民的热烈响应和同情。”
    美帝国主义者直接的武装干涉，只能增加你们解放全部国土和我们最后解放台湾的某些困难，而不能阻碍我们夺取胜利。如果美帝国主义第七舰队胆敢向我们解放台湾的大军放出第一炮，我们也一定要狠狠地教训他们——如同你们在朝鲜的领海上所曾经教训过的一样。
    同志们！让我们在驱逐美国武装干涉者的战斗中，在保卫世界和平的斗争中，并肩前进吧！
    谨向你们荣膺祖国的荣誉的勋章致贺，并祝你们胜利连接胜利，直至把美国武装干涉者全部驱逐出境。
        中国人民海军华东军区海军政治部卢文光  七月二十四日
