Xinhua News Agency, July 12th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS, July 11th: The Soviet Government has delivered a reply to the UN Secretary-General Lie. The content is as follows:

　　"To Mr. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, New York:

　　The Soviet Government has received your telegram, which states the full text of the Security Council's resolution of July 7th, concerning placing armed forces and other assistance under the command of a so-called "unified command led by the United States," requesting the United States to appoint the commander of such forces, and using the United Nations flag in the Korean War, etc.

　　The Soviet Government believes that the passage of the above resolution violates the United Nations Charter as seriously as the Security Council's resolution of June 27th on the Korean issue. This resolution was passed in the absence of two permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union and China. Furthermore, with the participation of a seventh party—the Kuomintang elements who have no legal right to represent China—the resolution was passed by only six votes.

　　In view of the above, it is clear that this decision of the Security Council also has no legal effect.

　　In addition, the Soviet Government considers it necessary to draw your attention to the following matters:

　　The purpose of the above resolution of the Security Council is to illegally use the United Nations flag to cover up the United States' armed actions in Korea, which is a direct act of aggression by the United States against the Korean people.

　　For all the above reasons, the Soviet Government has reason to declare: The Security Council's decision of July 7th is: 1. Illegal; 2. Direct support for armed aggression against the Korean people."

### 苏联政府致赖伊复文  宣布安理会决议为非法

　　苏联政府致赖伊复文
    宣布安理会决议为非法
    指出由美国统率干涉军和利用联合国旗帜侵略朝鲜，严重地违反了联合国宪章。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：苏联政府顷向联合国秘书长赖伊递送复文一件。内容如下：
    “纽约联合国秘书长赖伊先生：
    苏联政府已接到你的电报，该电叙述安全理事会七月七日决议案的全文，内中涉及将武装部队及其他援助置于所谓“在美国率领下的统一的司令部”指挥之下，请求美国指派这类部队的司令官，并在朝鲜战事中使用联合国旗帜等项。
    苏联政府认为上述决议的通过，其违反联合国宪章之严重，一如安理会六月二十七日关于朝鲜问题的决议。此项决议是在安理会两个常任理事国——苏联和中国——缺席的情形下通过的。此外，在有第七者——无合法权利代表中国的国民党分子——参加的情形下，该决议仅为六票所通过。
    鉴于上述情况，很明显的，安理会这一决定也没有法律的效力。
    此外，苏联政府认为有提请先生注意下述事项之必要：
    安理会上述决议的目的，在于非法利用联合国旗帜，以掩盖美国在朝鲜的武装行动，这是美国对朝鲜人民的直接侵略行为。
    由于上述种种，苏联政府有理由宣布：安理会七月七日的决定为：一、非法；二、对武装侵略朝鲜人民的直接支持。”
