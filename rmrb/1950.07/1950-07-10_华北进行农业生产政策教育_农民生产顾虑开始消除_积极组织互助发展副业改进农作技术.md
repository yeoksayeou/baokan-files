　　North China Carries Out Agricultural Production Policy Education
    Farmers' Production Concerns Begin to Dissipate
    Actively Organize Mutual Aid to Develop Sideline Occupations and Improve Farming Techniques

    [Report from this newspaper] This reporter interviewed a responsible person from the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the ideological trends of farmers in North China concerning the development of production. The following is a summary of the remarks:

    Since the beginning of spring, the education on the New Democratic agricultural production policy carried out in various parts of North China has penetrated deeply into the broad countryside. Farmers' concerns about "eating from the big pot" and fears of another "equal distribution" have begun to dissipate. A new and lively atmosphere is emerging in rural production.

    The promotion of the New Democratic agricultural production policy is being carried out in the following different forms:

    First, the county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in various regions, during the intensive training of rural party members and cadres, encourage party members to raise ideological questions as much as possible. Through discussions and debates, they come to understand the party's various policies in rural areas, such as rewarding increased production and developing mutual assistance, as well as understanding the future of social development and the long-term goal of communism. According to a report from Pingyuan Province, out of 243 trainees in the Seventh District of Qingfeng County, only 75 were active producers before the training, but after the training, 167 people changed their attitudes and actively led the masses in production, while others also changed their attitudes towards production. Xinji, the deputy village head of Hua County, after receiving training, used the grain he had buried for three years to purchase carts and farm implements and used his own transformation to promote the policy to the masses.

    Second, policies are universally explained and promoted through people's representative conferences at all levels. Before the start of spring plowing, nearly 100 counties in Hebei Province held people's representative conferences at all levels to widely convey and discuss the current production policy. After the representatives returned to their villages to convey and explain the policy, it directly penetrated the broad masses. After holding people's representative conferences at all levels in the Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province, various classes had the following reactions: Poor peasants said, "In the past, we always thought that poor peasants were precious, but now we know that labor and production are precious." Middle peasants said, "Now that the policy has been issued, we can put our hearts at ease and produce boldly." Landlords before the land reform said, "I never thought that getting rich through labor would include us." The unanimous reflection everywhere was: "This representative conference is a conference of reassurance." "The burden has been placed on the conference."

    Third, propaganda and education are combined with concrete actions, and concrete examples and practical actions to ensure land ownership and property rights are used to make the masses understand the policy and then believe in it. The Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province organized a production inspection team for this purpose, specializing in inspecting and handling acts that violated legitimate property and production policies. In addition, various occasions are used to commend production models and labor heroes, and they are asked to specifically introduce the process of getting rich through production, which has a great practical educational effect on the masses. When the representative of Nanjingse Village, which has relatively good production in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, introduced the village's method and experience of getting rich through "organization" at the district people's representative conference at all levels, he brought the village's 60-plus fat mules, wearing bells and red tassels, and led them out together for all the representatives to see, which greatly encouraged the representatives present.

    Judging from the situation in areas where the policy has been implemented more deeply, after the farmers' ideological concerns have been dispelled, they urgently demand to improve production in various ways. In Anyang, Lin County and other places in Pingyuan Province, the development of mutual aid groups has been rapid since the beginning of spring. In addition to implementing agricultural mutual aid, farmers are also striving to develop sideline industries such as transportation to increase production. In many villages in Lin County, mutual aid groups leave some people at home and some go out to work as bricklayers and tilers. There are also some villages where farmers rely on the manpower and financial resources of the "organized" to jointly build houses, building for this family this year and for that family next year. In the Anyang Special District alone, more than 10,000 rooms have been built in this way this spring. The construction of houses is also very common in Hebei. Many households are formulating personal home-building plans within the mutual aid group. In addition, due to farmers' eagerness to buy land, land prices in Anyang, Heze and other places have risen rapidly by one to three times this spring. In the Handan Special District of Hebei, land disputes have increased significantly this spring, and the problem of disputed land boundaries is even more common. Although these problems should be resolved quickly, they also show that farmers love the land. In addition, it is also very common for farmers to buy large farm implements together. In Daming and other five counties alone, more than 44,000 plows, seeders, and other items have been added this spring. However, in many places, due to the bias of coercion and commandism in the past when promoting mutual aid, after the farmers solved their production concerns, they demanded to "go it alone," but the leading organs in these places mistakenly believed that the farmers were unwilling to organize after they became "rich." This erroneous understanding is currently being corrected.

    Farmers' enthusiasm for developing production is also manifested in their urgent demand for the improvement of farming techniques. This spring, the arable land in the Handan Special District of Hebei Province was plowed and harrowed four times, and the amount of fertilizer applied increased by an average of one-third compared to last year. In many places in Pingyuan, farmers urgently demand techniques for cultivating, soaking seeds, managing cotton, and controlling aphids. Many farmers have demarcated one or two points of land on the headlands and edges of the fields to conduct experiments on seed soaking and germination rates, and some have pots and jars all over their homes with germination experiments everywhere. Leadership methods such as empty talk and simply holding meetings to mobilize have been universally opposed by farmers. Cadres learning techniques and bringing techniques to the countryside are warmly welcomed by farmers. A district cadre in Anyang used to use coercive methods to convene meetings in the village, and no one would come to the meeting. This time, he learned the seed soaking technique and went to the countryside, and the farmers automatically gathered around to learn. The farmers said, "If you hold such a meeting in the future, you don't have to urge people to come!" The district and village cadres who helped them control cotton aphids were enthusiastically called "cotton doctors" by the farmers. Some cadres have begun to learn technical experience from old farmers and have gradually learned the mass line method of "learning from the masses and educating the masses," and the style of commandism has also begun to change.

　　华北进行农业生产政策教育
    农民生产顾虑开始消除
    积极组织互助发展副业改进农作技术
    【本报讯】记者就华北农民对发展生产的思想动态问题访问了中共中央华北局负责人，承发表谈话如下：
    入春以来，华北各地所进行的新民主主义的农业生产政策的教育，已深入广大农村。农民中怕“吃大锅饭”，怕再“平分”的顾虑已开始消除。农村生产呈现着新的活泼气象。
    新民主主义的农业生产政策的宣传，是用以下几种不同形式进行的：
    第一，各地中共县委在集训农村党员干部中，使党员尽量提出思想疑问，经过讨论与争论，了解党在农村中的奖励增产、发展互助等各项政策，了解社会发展的前途与共产主义的远大奋斗目标。据平原省报告，清丰七区二百四十三个学员未受训前，积极生产者仅七十五人，受训后就有一百六十七人转变，并积极领导群众生产，其他也都改变了对生产的态度。滑县辛集副村长受训后，将埋存三年的粮食购置大车、农具，并以自己的转变向群众宣传。
    第二，普遍通过各界人民代表会议解释与宣传政策。河北于春耕开始前，全省有近百个县都举行了各界代表会普遍传达讨论当前生产政策，经过代表回村传达解释，使政策直接深入到广大群众中去。平原省新乡专区各县在召开过各界代表会议后各阶层有如下的反映：贫农说：“过去总认为贫农是宝贝蛋，现在才知道劳动生产是宝贝蛋。”中农说：“政策发下来了，放一百二十个心大胆生产。”土地改革前的地主说：“想不到劳动致富还包括我们。”各地的一致反映是：“这次代表会是放心会。”“包袱放在大会上了。”
    第三，宣传教育与具体行动结合，以具体事例与确保地权财权的实际行动，使群众由了解政策到相信政策。平原省安阳专区曾为此组织了生产检查团，专门检查与处理侵犯合法财产和违犯生产政策的行为。此外利用各种场合，表扬生产模范与劳动英雄，叫他们具体介绍生产致富的经过，对群众的实践教育作用很大。平原省林县生产较好的南景色村代表，在区各界代表会议上介绍该村如何经过“组织起来”生产致富的办法与经验时，把该村的六十多条肥骡，带上铃铛，披上红缨，一齐牵出来让全体代表看，对到会代表的鼓舞极大。
    从政策贯彻较为深入地区的情况看：农民在思想顾虑解除之后，迫切要求以各种方法，提高生产。平原省安阳、林县等地，入春以来，互助组的发展很快。除实行农业互助之外，农民并努力发展副业运输业等来增加生产。林县不少村互助组留一部分人在家，一部分出外作泥瓦工。还有些村农民依靠“组织起来”的人力财力合伙修盖房屋，今年给这家盖，明年再给那家盖。仅安阳专区今春如此修建的房屋即达万余间。河北修建房屋的也很普遍。不少户都在互助组内制订个人的建家计划。另外，由于农民争购土地，安阳、菏泽等地今春地价迅速上涨一至三倍。河北的邯郸专区，今春土地纠纷显著增多，争地界问题更为普遍，这类问题虽应迅速解决，但也说明了农民的热爱土地。此外，农民合伙买大农具也很普遍。仅大名等五县，今春即增犁、耧等四万四千多件。但也有许多地方，由于过去在推广互助时有强迫命令的偏向，因此农民在解决生产顾虑后，要求“单干”，而这些地方的领导机关却曾误以为农民“富”了之后，不愿组织起来。这种错误的认识目前正在纠正中。
    农民发展生产的热情，还表现在迫切要求农作技术的提高上。河北省邯郸专区今年春地作到耕耙四遍，施肥比去年平均增加三分之一。平原不少地方，农民迫切要求耕作、浸种、管理棉花治蚜等技术。许多农民在地头、地边划出一、二分土地做浸种发芽率的试验，还有的在家里盆盆罐罐摆着的到处都是发芽的试验。说空话、单纯开会动员等领导方法，已受到农民的普遍反对。干部学习技术，带技术下乡，受到农民热烈欢迎。安阳一个区干部，过去到村里用强迫办法召集会也没人来开会，这次学会了浸种技术下乡，农民却自动围拢来学。农民说：“你以后开这样会，不用催人都要来！”农民对帮他们除治棉蚜的区、村干部，热情地称为“棉花医生”。有些干部开始找老农学习技术经验，逐渐学会了“向群众学习，又教育群众”的群众路线方法，强迫命令作风也开始有所转变。
