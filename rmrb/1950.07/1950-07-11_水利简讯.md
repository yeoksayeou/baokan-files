　　Jiangxi Province Completes Major Canal Construction Project
    The drought prevention and irrigation projects started in Jiangxi Province this spring have been largely completed. The Agricultural Department of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, in order to restore farmland water conservancy in the province and strive to complete this year's grain and cotton production increase targets, formulated plans this spring to build five large-scale irrigation projects and 2,460 small-scale projects such as reservoirs, dikes, and ditches. As of the end of May, the main projects of the Wan'an Canal, Anfu Canal, and Luxia Weir, such as dams and diversion canals, have been completed, irrigating more than 57,500 mu of farmland. The construction of small-scale projects reached 4,130, exceeding the original plan by more than 67 percent, irrigating more than 1.2 million mu of farmland. In total, the completion of the above two projects can increase rice production by more than 141,000 dan.
            
    Farmers in Kangning Township, Wugang, Hunan, Rush to Repair Xinshi Dike
    The area along the Dao River in the second village of Kangning Township, Wugang County, Hunan, has low-lying terrain and very winding waterways, with rapid currents. During the summer floods last year, the area suffered from water disasters, losing 1,200 shi of rice, and more than 30 mu of land were completely submerged. This spring, the county People's Government, in order to prevent the riverside paddy fields from being washed away again, specially loaned 11,000 jin of grain to assist farmers in building the Xinshi Dike in the Yangjiaba area. It is estimated that the project will require about 5,000 workdays. Upon completion, it can save 1,500 mu of paddy fields and benefit 331 households.

    Xuancheng Vigorously Builds Ponds and Dams
    According to statistics from 36 villages in nine districts of Xuancheng County, Anhui, 89 ponds and dams have been repaired, capable of irrigating more than 170,200 mu of farmland. As of mid-June, 58 had been completed, and the rest are still under construction in conjunction with drought resistance, seedling protection, and flood prevention work, and it is estimated that they will all be completed by mid-July. Assuming an increase in grain production of 20 jin per mu of irrigated land, a total of more than 3.4 million jin can be increased.

    Huainan Mining Area Builds Water Conservancy Projects to Provide Work Relief, Protect Mines, and Rescue Disaster Victims
    In order to protect the Bagong Mountain coalfield, prevent the Huai River from flowing back into the two lakes (Qiancai Lakes, both of which are coalfields), and guide mountain floods and rainwater into the Huai River to ensure the safe production of underground workers, the Huainan Mining Area has specially organized a water conservancy engineering team to provide work relief and build water conservancy projects on Bagong Mountain. In addition to completing the first phase of the Huai Dike project in the Lao (Longtou) Ying (Taizi) section, with 18.240262 million cubic meters of earthwork, achieving the preliminary task of preventing the Huai River from flowing back, protecting mines and farmland, and relieving disaster victims, it has now excavated a water diversion ditch project about six kilometers long, intercepting 14 square kilometers of rainwater and mountain floods (accounting for 60 percent of the rainfall in the Bagong Mountain mining area), basically completing the task of protecting mines and rescuing disaster victims.

    Completion of the Wenzhou Huiqiao Dousha Gate Construction Project
    The Wenzhou Huiqiao Dousha Gate construction project, one of the four major water conservancy projects in Zhejiang Province, was completed on May 15th, one and a half months ahead of the original plan, under the direct leadership of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and with the assistance and efforts of the local People's Government and the general public. A water release ceremony was held on June 2nd. After the completion of this project, more than 10,000 mu of farmland will directly benefit, 280,000 mu of farmland will indirectly benefit, and it will resist water and drought disasters and eliminate the harm of salt (sea) water erosion of farmland, providing a certain guarantee for increased agricultural production.
            
    All Large and Small Canal Projects in Hanzhong Completed
    The three major canals in the Hanzhong area of southern Shaanxi, Hanhui, Baohui, and Xuhui, as well as small-scale water conservancy projects in various counties, have been successively repaired and completed, ensuring the full water supply for nearly 700,000 mu of paddy fields. The Administrative Office has issued a proclamation strengthening water conservancy management and ensuring reasonable irrigation, and water release leadership organs have been established in various places, so farmers have good water release order. Disputes over dam water, water theft, and water grabbing have also been greatly reduced.
            
    The Hetao Fuxing Canal Releases Water on Schedule
    The Fuxing Canal, one of the four major trunk canals within the Hetao area of Suixi, which is related to the lives of 30,000 to 40,000 people, began its spring repair of gate boxes on April 25th. After 30 days of efforts by 980 migrant workers and 60 carters, water has been released on schedule. The canal flows through Yanjiang and Wuyuan counties, and the irrigation area is Zhengda, Zhengyi, and other eight townships; there are 13 large branch canals and more than 20 small branch canals, with a total length of 160 li, a canal width of eight zhang, and a depth of six chi, with an irrigation area of more than 460,000 mu.

    Helin Repairs 23 Canals, Irrigating 290,000 Mu of Land
    Helin County, Suiyuan Province, planned to repair seven canals this spring, but later the masses requested to repair 16 more, for a total of 23. After the active repair by the masses, six were completed by the end of May, irrigating more than 12,000 mu of land; the other 17 are now 70 percent completed. It is estimated that after all are completed, a total of 170,000 mu of wasteland and 120,000 mu of sandy wasteland can be irrigated.
