　　Commemorating the Heroine Zhao Yiman
    ——Written for the Premiere of the Film "Zhao Yiman"
    Qiu He
    Today is the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The premiere of the historical biographical film "Zhao Yiman," which is based on the life of Zhao Yiman, a female hero of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, is especially meaningful on this day. This is because the arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice of Zhao Yiman, the female hero of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, as reflected in the film "Zhao Yiman," is one of the glorious chapters of the Chinese Communist Party's 29 years of heroic struggle.
    This film depicts the heroic deeds of Comrade Zhao Yiman, the martyr, the situation of the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of Northeast China in underground anti-Japanese struggles after the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang sold out the people of Northeast China under the policy of non-resistance, and the great scenes of the vast number of peasants in Northeast China supporting the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. Whether in the cities, in the vast rural areas, or in the snow-covered mountains and dense forests, the Chinese Communist Party has always led its members, united with the broad masses of workers and peasants, fearing neither the enemy's search, torture, beatings, severe cold, nor hunger, shedding blood and struggling for the cause of national liberation, and even unreservedly offering their lives.
    Comrade Zhao Yiman is such a typical figure. In her final days in prison, she silently reported to the Party: "The enemy is about to execute me, and I am prepared. Finally, I examined myself. My conscience is at peace, and my thoughts are yearning for my beloved Party, yearning for the great anti-Japanese national struggle, and yearning for my comrades. Today, I offer my life and report to the Party with my final action. I proudly raise my head and sacrifice for the sake of the suffering China…" Zhao Yiman's spirit of fearlessness embodies the noble qualities of a communist, and is a concrete manifestation of the Bolshevik spirit. This spirit has been cultivated and nurtured through the education of the Chinese Communist Party and tested and tempered through long-term trials.
    For this reason, Comrade Zhao Yiman is an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party and a good daughter of the Chinese nation. Not only did she always "hold her head high" in the enemy's prison, but she also demonstrated the staunch character of a communist in her daily struggles. She lived in Harbin, under enemy rule. After a day of hard work, she returned home and reported on her work and discussed the next day's struggle with her husband, Comrade Lao Cao. When they had to move to avoid being discovered by the enemy, Comrade Zhao Yiman carefully burned the secret documents while recalling the comrades who had sacrificed in the struggle. She said to her husband, Comrade Cao: "How many comrades have we sacrificed! For the sake of the revolution, you must take care of yourself."
    Although Comrade Zhao Yiman dedicated her life to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, her spirit is immortal. Let us remember her words to Comrade Xiao Han on the day of her heroic sacrifice: "Tomorrow is July 1st, the anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. You must remember, when you get out, don't forget the revolution."

　　纪念女英雄赵一曼
    ——为影片《赵一曼》公演而作
    秋禾
    今天是中国共产党诞生二十九周年纪念日。《赵一曼》这部以东北抗联女英雄赵一曼的一生为题材的历史传记影片，在这一天公演特别富有伟大的意义。因为影片《赵一曼》所反映的东北抗日联军女英雄赵一曼的艰苦斗争及英勇牺牲，正是中国共产党二十九年来英勇奋斗的光荣史篇之一。
    这部片子写出了烈士赵一曼同志的英勇事迹，写出了蒋介石匪帮在不抵抗政策下出卖了东北人民以后中国共产党领导东北人民进行地下抗日斗争的情形，也写出了东北广大农民支援抗日游击战争的伟大场面。无论在城市中也好，在广大的农村中也好，在冰天雪地的丛山密林中也好，中国共产党始终领导着自己的党员，和广大工农群众结合在一起，不怕敌人的搜捕、酷刑、拷打、严寒和饥饿，为民族解放事业流血奋斗，以至毫不吝惜地供献出自己的生命。
    赵一曼同志正是这样的典型人物，她在最后的监狱里，默默地向党作着报告：“敌人就要把我处死，我已经作了准备。最后，我检查了自己，我的良心是安静的，我的思想是向往着我那亲爱的党，向往着伟大的抗日民族斗争，向往着我的战友们。今天，我献出自己的生命，用我最后的行动向党作报告。我高傲地扬起头来，为着多难的中国而牺牲……”。赵一曼这种大无畏精神正表现了共产党员的高贵品质，正是布尔什维克精神的具体表现。而这种精神是经过了中国共产党的教育培植，经过了长期的考验锻炼成的。
    正因为如此，赵一曼同志是中国共产党的优秀党员，中华民族的好女儿。她不仅在敌人的监狱里始终“昂着头”，就是在日常斗争中她也表现了一个共产党员的坚贞性格。她住在敌人统治下的哈尔滨，经过了一天的奔波之后回到家里，和自己的丈夫老曹同志交待工作，商量明天的斗争。当他俩为了不使敌人发现必须搬家的时候，赵一曼同志一面小心地烧毁了秘密文件，一面回忆着在斗争中牺牲了的战友。她对丈夫曹同志说：“我们牺牲了多少个同志呀！为了革命，你必须保重自己。”
    赵一曼同志虽然为着中国人民解放事业献出了自己的生命，但她的精神是永垂不朽的。让我们记着她慷慨就义的一天嘱咐小韩同志的话吧：“明天是七一，是中国共产党诞生的日子，你要记着，出去一定不要忘记革命。”
