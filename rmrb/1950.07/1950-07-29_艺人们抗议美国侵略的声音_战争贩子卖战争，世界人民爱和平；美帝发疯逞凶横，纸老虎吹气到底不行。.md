　　Artists' Voices Protesting American Aggression
    "War-mongers sell war, people of the world love peace; American imperialism goes mad and acts aggressively, the paper tiger, puffed up, will ultimately fail..."
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    Artists in Beijing's opera circles are protesting the aggression of American imperialists with indignant feelings.
    Under the leadership of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, through the opera circle lecture class student association, actors from Peking Opera, Ping Opera, and Quyi circles quickly formed "street propaganda teams," "stage speech groups," and "radio broadcast groups" to carry out propaganda work separately. A large number of male and female actors beloved by the people of Beijing voluntarily signed up to participate. Everyone enthusiastically went to the streets to promote and perform during the day, and returned to the theater to perform their professional plays in the evening.
    The street propaganda team was dispatched starting from the 23rd. The first day's team was led by Lian Kuoru and Zhao Fucheng. The propaganda vehicle flew a red flag and drove all the way to the Jianlou (Arrow Tower). Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, citizens followed up the Jianlou, crowding the Dazhong Amusement Center. Lian Kuoru first used his storytelling skills to give a speech to the masses. He denounced the ugly spectacle of American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, saying, "American imperialism has found two adopted sons: one is Chiang Kai-shek, and the other is Syngman Rhee, but these two adopted sons are worse than each other!" After he finished speaking, Gu Rongfu and Yin Fulai continued to sing "Hunting Beasts," which the citizens responded to with hearty laughter. Chang Changsheng of the Xinxing Troupe and Zhao Fucheng of the Youlan Ping Opera Troupe went up one after another to recount the crimes of American imperialism. Guan Xuezeng and Cai Liangui each performed a section of "Pricking the Paper Tiger" and "Defending Peace." After the propaganda at Jianlou was completed, the artists excitedly carried their gongs, drums, and props to the Fourth Cultural Center in Liulichang. When they stopped briefly at Xiliushujing, citizens surrounded the propaganda vehicle. The artists led the masses in enthusiastically shouting slogans against American imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan. When the vehicle arrived at the Cultural Center, the masses there were already waiting anxiously.
    On the afternoon of the 24th, the propaganda team, led by Xiao Shengxuan and Xun Lingxiang, began work at the Second Cultural Center in Gulou. Female artists such as Tong Baoling and Huang Yuhua also went. As soon as the propaganda team members got off the bus, people quickly filled the east square of the Bell Tower. Tong Baoling stood in front of the loudspeaker and excitedly spoke out the evils of American imperialism, arousing a wave of angry shouts in the square. Cao Baolu of the Quyi circle used his singing voice of Danxian (a type of Chinese ballad) to vividly and loudly sing "American Imperialism Unmasked":
    "War-mongers sell war, people of the world love peace; American imperialism goes mad and acts aggressively, the paper tiger, puffed up, will ultimately fail..."
    Cao Baolu's lyrics moved many audience members.
    Then, the artists squeezed out of the crowd and quickly began performing at the Cultural Palace. The propaganda work did not end until it was already dark, amidst the applause of the masses.
    On the third day, the propaganda team appeared on the streets of Beijing again. Li Shaochun, Xie Hongwen, and Luo Yuping all excitedly gave speeches to the masses against American aggression. Cao Baolu's "American Imperialism Unmasked" was once again and again enthusiastically welcomed by the masses. Sun Yukui and Yu Junbo's crosstalk "Such is America" and Cai Liangui's "Defending Peace" also received satisfactory responses from the masses.
    For three days, the artists completely forgot their fatigue, sweating in the hot sun while singing. Zhou Ruiming, a female bookbinder from a printing factory, and a young worker surnamed Zhang were moved to express that they must learn from the spirit of such active propaganda from the artists in the opera circles, work hard to produce, and support the liberation of Taiwan. An old lady named Ding, who was fifty-four years old, repeatedly said: "After listening to their performances, many people will understand the crimes of American aggression against Taiwan and Korea."
    Simultaneous with the street propaganda, the artists used radio broadcasts, speeches, slogans, fast-clapping rhymes, short plays, and Quyi performances in radio stations, theaters, Quyi venues, and amusement centers every day to continuously promote.
    The artists also made heartfelt and angry accusations.
    Cai Liangui, an artist who plays the Xihe Dagu (a type of Chinese ballad), has been selflessly promoting for three days in a row. He told the reporter a painful memory: In the summer of 1946, some artists went from Tangshan to Shanhaiguan to perform. When they first arrived at the Shanhaiguan train station, an American soldier stopped Liu Xiaofang, a seventeen-year-old female artist who sang Tangshan Dagu, and shamelessly molested her, forcibly dragging and hugging her towards the examination room. Liu Xiaofang returned to the theater, crying bitterly, without saying a word, and then fell ill. She died in less than two and a half months. Cai Liangui said with indignation: "This is a blood feud!"
    Xie Hongwen, a female Peking Opera actress from the New China Experimental Opera Troupe, told the reporter with great sadness that every time she thought of American soldiers molesting and humiliating Chinese women, she felt incomparable anger in her heart. In the years when American soldiers occupied Chinese territory, she personally witnessed many Chinese women in Tianjin being subjected to the insults and seduction of American soldiers. Many artists have said: This propaganda has deepened their understanding and hatred of the crimes of American imperialism.
    Yes, the beastly behavior of American imperialists in China is now more clearly understood by the entire Chinese people, just as the artist Yin Fulai said: "Licentious, shameless, and debauched, the American hooligans who fight wars with carpets are bound to be defeated by the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Korean People's Army."

　　艺人们抗议美国侵略的声音
    “战争贩子卖战争，世界人民爱和平；美帝发疯逞凶横，纸老虎吹气到底不行。……”
    本报记者  柏生
    北京戏曲界的艺人们，怀着愤慨的心情反对美帝国主义者的侵略。
    在北京市文联的领导下，通过戏曲界讲习班同学会，京剧、评戏、曲艺界的演员们迅速地组成了“街头宣传队”、“舞台演讲组”、“电台广播组”，分头展开了宣传工作。大批为京市人民所喜爱的男女演员们都自动地报名参加。每个人都在白天热烈地到街头去宣传演唱，晚上再回到戏院演出自己的业务戏。
    从二十三日起，街头宣传队就出动了。第一天的队伍由连阔如、赵富成率领。宣传车飘着红旗，一直开往箭楼。锣鼓声中，市民们都跟着上了箭楼，挤满了大众游艺社。连阔如首先以他说评书的口才，向群众演讲。他斥责美帝侵略台湾朝鲜的丑剧说：“美帝找到了两个干儿子：一个就是蒋介石，一个就是李承晚，但是这两个干儿子一个不如一个！”在他讲完话以后顾荣甫、尹福来就接着唱起了“打野兽”，市民们报以痛快的笑声。新兴社的常长生、幽兰评剧社的赵富成相继上去，叙述了美帝的罪状。关学增和蔡连贵每人更来了一段“戳破纸老虎”、“保卫和平”。在箭楼宣传完，艺人们兴奋地背着锣鼓、道具，往琉璃厂第四文化馆出发。路经西柳树井稍停的时候，市民便围住了宣传车。艺人们带领着群众热烈地高呼反对美帝侵略朝鲜台湾的口号。车到文化馆，那里的群众早在焦急地等待着了。
    二十四日下午，宣传队由萧盛萱、荀令香率领，在鼓楼第二文化馆展开工作。女艺人童葆苓和黄玉华等都去了。宣传队人员刚下车，人们就很快地围满了钟楼的东广场。童葆苓站在扩音器前，激动地讲出美帝的罪恶，引起了广场上一片愤怒的呼声。曲艺界曹宝禄用他唱单弦的嗓音，生动响亮地唱出了“美帝现形记”：
    “战争贩子卖战争，世界人民爱和平，美帝发疯逞凶横，纸老虎吹气到底不行……”
    曹宝禄的唱词，感动了不少的观众。
    接着，艺人们从群众的包围中挤出来，很快地又在文化宫开始演唱。直到天已经黑下来，宣传工作才在群众的掌声中结束。
    第三天，宣传队又出现在北京的街头。李少春、谢虹雯、罗玉苹都激动地向群众做了反对美国侵略的讲演。曹宝禄的“美帝现形记”，在这里又一次、再一次的受到了群众热烈的欢迎。孙玉奎、于俊波的对口相声“如此美国”，蔡连贵的“保卫和平”也都同样地得到群众的满意的反响。
    三天来，艺人们完全忘记了自己的疲劳，在烈日下，一面挥汗，一面演唱。一个印刷厂的装订女工周瑞明和一个张姓的青年工人被感动的表示，他们一定要学习戏曲界艺人们这样积极宣传的精神，努力生产，支援解放台湾。五十四岁的丁老太太连声地说：“听了他们的演唱，许多人都会了解美国侵略台湾朝鲜的罪恶了。”
    与街头宣传进行的同时，艺人们每天在电台、戏院、曲艺场所和游艺社，利用广播、讲演、标语、口号、快板、小戏、曲艺不间歇地宣传。
    艺人们并作了发自内心的愤怒控诉。
    演奏西河大鼓的艺人蔡连贵一连三天都一直忘我地宣传着。他告诉了记者一段惨痛的回忆：一九四六年的夏天，一些艺人们由唐山到山海关去演唱，刚到山海关的车站时，一个美国兵拦住了演唱唐山大鼓的十七岁的女艺人刘筱舫，无耻地调戏她，强力连拉带抱地竟往检查室里走去了。刘筱舫回到戏园子里，痛哭着，什么话也不说，以后就病倒，不到两个半月她就死了。蔡连贵满怀愤慨地说：“这是血的仇恨！”
    新中国实验戏团的京剧女演员谢虹雯带着十分沉痛的心情告诉记者，每当她一想起美国兵玩弄和侮辱中国妇女的时候，她心里就迸发着无比的愤恨。美国兵在中国土地上盘据的年月里，在天津，她亲眼看到过许多中国妇女，受尽了美兵的侮辱和诱惑。好些艺人们都说：这一次宣传，加深了自己对于美帝的罪恶的认识和痛恨。
    是的，美帝国主义者在中国野兽般的行为，今天，被全中国人民认识得更清楚了，正如艺人尹福来的话说：“荒淫无耻，放荡下流，铺着毯子打仗的美国流氓，终于要被英勇的中国人民解放军和朝鲜人民军打垮的。”
