　　Rongcheng District Cadres Violate Human Rights
    County Government and County Party Committee Shield and Connive, Should Be Reviewed
    To the Editor:
    On the evening of January 5th, Wang Zhenfang, the armed cadre of the Fourth District of Rongcheng County, Hebei, returned to Xixiaoli Village from the district government after reporting on his work. He encountered Li Luorou and Li Shuanyi from Wang Village in the same district (returning from watching a night show in Heilongkou Village). They were carrying a piece of wood (a wooden stake used for dike repair in the village, left on the road, intending to carry it back to the village). When Wang Zhenfang saw them, he immediately said, "What are you doing?" The two men were frightened and dropped the wood and ran. Wang chased after them but accidentally broke his leg and could not continue. He fired a warning shot to scare them and finally caught Li Luorou, slapped him twice, and tied him up and押送 to the militia headquarters of Xixiaoli Village.
    On January 6th, Xixiaoli Village sent Wang Zhenfang to the district office by cart. He and education assistant Liu Yingjie fabricated a story saying that Li Luorou had snatched his gun and injured his leg. When Song Chunfang, the deputy minister of the district armed forces, heard this, he immediately took Li Luorou to the district office. At this time, Ren Shuhua, the chief of the county construction section, was also at the district office. When he learned about Wang Zhenfang's injury, he said, "A thief snatching a gun and injuring someone, what is the world coming to?" At dusk, Song Chunfang took Li Luorou and Li Shuanyi to the district office to force a confession. Li Luorou firmly denied hitting Wang Zhenfang. Ren Shuhua said, "Why keep asking him? Hang him up!" Liu Yingjie, Song Chunfang, and others then used ropes to hang Li Luorou on a locust tree. Liu Yingjie beat him while saying, "If you don't confess, I'll keep beating you!" Chen Guanshu, the secretary of the district party committee, also hit him a few times. Li Xiaochen and Gu Zongwen (a temporary messenger) also joined in the beating. Gu Zongwen even used cigarettes to burn Li Luorou's face and ribs. After an hour, Li Luorou stopped yelling, and Song Chunfang ordered Li Xiaochen to let him down. At this time, Li Luorou was already on the verge of death.
    While Li Luorou was being held, the cadres of Wang Village testified that he was an honest farmer with no history of theft and wanted to bail him out. However, the district government refused to allow bail.
    After the county leadership discovered this matter, County Magistrate Liu Geng made a simple report to the Baoding Prefectural Commissioner's Office. The sub-branch of the prefectural people's court instructed the Rongcheng County government to hand over the cadres who illegally hanged people to the government for legal investigation and reported to the provincial court. After receiving the letter, the county conducted an investigation but did not immediately handle the matter. The prefectural sub-branch sent another letter on March 15th urging action and instructing them to report the results. On April 4th, the commissioner sent another letter asking about the results, but the county still did not report them.
    Li Luorou appealed to the prefectural court on April 8th. In his appeal, he stated, "Liu Yingjie and others are still at large and have not been punished in any way, clearly showing that the county government is shielding Liu Yingjie and others, causing delays, and I only dare to be angry but not speak out..."
    After receiving Li Luorou's appeal, the prefectural court immediately sent someone to the county to investigate and verify the facts. To enforce discipline, the following sentences were imposed on the above-mentioned criminals: 1. Liu Yingjie and Song Chunfang, abusing their authority, hanging farmers, and violating policy, should be dismissed from their positions; Liu was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and Song was sentenced to ten months of imprisonment. 2. Ren Shuhua was convicted as an accessory and sentenced to six months of imprisonment. 3. Wang Zhenfang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for falsely accusing the other party. The above four criminals were ordered to compensate Li Luorou with two *shi* of millet for medical expenses.
    The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to enforce party discipline, decided: Liu Yingjie had been severely criticized twice and was given a punishment of probation within the Party. Wang Zhenfang had engaged in corruption and was the principal offender in this matter, so he was expelled from the Party. Ren Shuhua was given a public warning. Song Chunfang was removed from his party work.
    After this incident, the county government and party committee did not handle the matter promptly, which greatly affected the credibility of the Party and the people's government among the masses. It is hoped that the county party committee and government will make a public review in the newspaper.

　　容城区干部侵犯人权
    县府县委包庇姑息应检讨编者同志：
    一月五日晚，河北容城县四区武装干事王振芳从区政府汇报工作回到西小里村，正遇上该区王村李洛肉、李拴义（由黑龙口村看夜戏回来）。他俩抬着一根木头（是该村修堤用的木桩，扔在路上，打算抬回村去。）王振芳一见即说：“干什么的？”该二人被吓得扔下木头即跑。王追赶时不慎把腿跌破，无法再追。他便鸣枪恐吓，终于抓住了李洛肉，打了他两个耳光，并将李洛肉捆起押到西小里村民兵队部。
    一月六日，西小里村将王振芳用车送到区公所。他与教育助理员刘英杰捏造说李洛肉夺了他的枪，把他的腿打伤。区武装副部长宋春芳听到后，即把李洛肉弄到区公所。这天，县建设科长任树华也在区公所。他知道了王振芳被打伤的事，便说：“小偷儿夺枪打人，这还成什么话？”点灯时分，宋春芳把李洛肉、李拴义押到区公所逼供。李洛肉坚不承认殴打王振芳的事。任树华说：“老问他作什么，吊起他来吧！”刘英杰、宋春芳等便用绳子把李洛肉吊在槐树上，刘英杰一面打一面说：“不说再打！”区委秘书陈贯书也打了他几下。李洛肉挣扎着，嘴里不住地喊叫。刘英杰说：“喊什么，再打！”李小臣、谷宗文（他是临时通讯员）即来参加殴打。谷宗文并用烟卷烧李洛肉的面部和肋际。一个钟头以后，李洛肉不嚷了，宋春芳才叫李小臣把他放下来。此时李洛肉已经奄奄一息。
    李洛肉在押时，王村的干部曾证明他是老实农民，过去没有偷盗行为，想把他保出来。但区政府不让保。
    该县领导发觉此事后，县长刘耕同志即向保定专署作了简单的报告。专区人民法院分院一面指示容城县政府将非法吊打人的干部交政府依法讯办；一面报告省法院。该县接到信后，虽曾作了调查，但未即时处理解决。专区分院于三月十五日又去函督促，并指示将处理结果报告他们。四月四日专员又来信催问处理结果，但该县仍未报告上去。
    李洛肉于四月八日向专署法院上诉。他在申诉书中说道：“刘英杰等现仍逍遥法外，并未受到任何处分，显见县政府包庇刘英杰等，以致拖延时日，我只敢怒而不敢言……。”
    专区法院接到李洛肉的上诉书后，随即派人亲去该县调查属实。为严明法纪，即分别判处了上述各犯的徒刑：一、刘英杰、宋春芳，滥用职权，吊打农民，违反政策，除应予撤职外，刘判一年徒刑，宋判十个月徒刑。二、任树华则以同谋犯论罪，判有期徒刑半年。三、王振芳诬告对方，判徒刑一年。并令以上四犯赔偿李洛肉医药费小米二市石。
    中共保定地委纪律检查委员会，为严明党纪，决定：刘英杰曾二次受过严重批评，决定给他留党察看的处分。王振芳曾有贪污腐化行为，又是此事的主犯，决定开除党籍。任树华受当众警告处分。宋春芳撤消党内工作。
    这件事情发生后，该县县政府、党委会，未抓紧处理，以致使党和人民政府在群众中的威信受到很大影响。希望该县县委及政府在报纸上作公开检讨。
