Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 7th: The South-Central Military Region and the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army are actively preparing to carry out cultural education throughout the army, striving to complete all preparations before October. The Political Department of the Military Region and Field Army is currently planning to solve the problems of teachers and teaching materials in the army's cultural education work, and to formulate various education systems and regulations. It has also decided to begin pilot programs in some units with lighter production and bandit suppression tasks in the near future to gain experience.

　　In solving the teacher problem, in addition to organizing existing intellectual cadres in the army into this movement, a large number of new intellectuals and young students have been absorbed and trained since last year to serve the cultural education work of the troops. Before the end of July this year, the Zhongnan Military and Political University will successively assign more than 12,000 intellectuals to the troops to serve as cultural instructors in various levels of crash schools, remedial schools, and battalion and company units. In addition, each unit also hires some experienced middle school teachers and professors in the local area according to the specific situation to help carry out troop education work.

　　In terms of teaching materials, most of the textbooks have been compiled or are being printed. As of now, eight kinds of teaching materials have been printed, totaling more than 800,000 copies, which will be distributed to the troops soon. In the process of compiling teaching materials, the Political Department of the Military Region specially hired professors and teachers with rich educational experience from major universities and middle schools in Wuhan to participate in this work in order to widely absorb experience.

　　In order to strengthen the leadership of cultural and educational work, the Political Department of the Military Region established a Cultural Education Committee in early May, and has successively formulated and promulgated various troop education systems and regulations. Military regions and armies in various provinces are also actively carrying out various preparatory work. So far, twelve large units have established cultural education committees. All departments are universally conducting cultural level surveys of companies, allocating cadres, training instructors, and preparing housing in order to strive to start cultural and educational work as soon as possible.

　　The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the entire army are welcoming the arrival of the cultural learning movement with joy and excitement and practical actions. They believe that this is the greatest concern of the country and the people for them. They have successively used their allowances and profits from production to buy pens and notebooks. The commanders and fighters unanimously stated: We will resolutely respond to the call of the higher authorities, learn culture well, improve ourselves and become modern national defense army soldiers, and forever defend the people's motherland and safeguard world lasting peace.

    积极准备开展文教工作
    现已组织了大批知识分子担任文化教员并编印教材八十余万册
    【新华社汉口七日电】人民解放军中南军区暨第四野战军正积极进行开展全军文化教育的准备工作，争取在十月以前完成一切准备事宜。军区暨野战军政治部，现正筹划解决全军文化教育工作中的教员、教材等问题和制定各种教育制度及条例，并决定于最近在某些担任生产、剿匪等任务较轻的部队中开始试行，以取得经验。
    在解决教员问题上，除了把全军现有的知识分子干部组织到这一运动中外，并于去年开始吸收和训练了大批新的知识分子和青年学生，使他们为部队的文化教育工作服务。中南军政大学在今年的七月底前，将一万二千多名知识分子陆续分配到部队中担任各级速成学校、补习学校及营、连单位的文化教员。此外，各部队并根据具体情况在当地聘请一些有经验的中学以上的教员和教授，帮助展开部队教育工作。
    在教材方面，大部分的课本均已编撰完毕或付印，截至目前为止，已印出八种教材共八十余万册，最近即将发到部队里去。在教材的编撰过程中，为了广泛地吸取经验，军区政治部特聘请了武汉市各大、中学中富有教育经验的教授和教员参加这一工作。
    为了加强对文化教育工作的领导，军区政治部于五月初成立了文化教育委员会，并先后制定和颁布了各种的部队教育制度和条例。各省军区各军亦正积极进行各种准备工作。到现在为止，已有十二个大单位建立了文化教育委员会。各部正在普遍进行连队文化水平调查，并配备干部，集训教员，筹备房舍，以争取早日展开文化教育工作。
    全军广大的指战员以欢欣鼓舞的心情和实际行动来迎接文化学习运动的到来。他们认为这是国家和人民对他们最大的关怀。他们纷纷用自己的津贴费和生产得来的红利买钢笔和学习本。指战员们一致表示：坚决响应上级号召，学好文化，提高自己成为一个现代化的国防军战士，永远捍卫人民祖国，保卫世界持久和平。
