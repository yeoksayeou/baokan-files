　　Elephants Arrive in the Capital, to be Displayed at the Western Suburban Park Starting Tomorrow

　　The Western Suburban Park (formerly the Garden of Ten Thousand Animals) outside Xizhimen in this city specially dispatched personnel to Guangzhou in mid-June to transport an elephant presented to the capital's park by the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government. It arrived in Beijing yesterday. Several birds, including the acacia bird, chenxiang bird, and pearl bird, were also purchased from Guangzhou. Starting July 14th, all of them will be displayed in the zoo of the Western Suburban Park. All are welcome to visit. (Jia Qi)
