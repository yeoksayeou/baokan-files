　　East China Military and Political Committee
    Issues Instructions on Land Reform Propaganda
    Organizes Study and Propaganda in a Planned Way
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th. The East China Military and Political Committee issued instructions on land reform propaganda on the 6th. The instructions stipulate that all levels of people's governments, people's organizations, agencies, schools, and troops should immediately, with preparation and in a planned way, organize all personnel to study the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform issues; and should also, with preparation and in a planned way, organize land reform propaganda for the masses. Before studying, political instructors in all schools should explain the two major documents clearly. The content of the propaganda should also be based on the Land Reform Law and Vice Chairman Liu's report. In both study and propaganda, any questions or specific issues raised by the masses should be carefully studied, and correct answers should be given based on the Land Reform Law and Vice Chairman Liu's report. If new problems arise or things are unclear, instructions should be requested from higher authorities and replies should only be given after obtaining instructions or permission from higher authorities. The instructions also stipulate that, apart from the formally published documents by central leaders, and the documents related to land reform published by the East China Military and Political Committee or the provinces with the approval of the central government, which can be used as references, other personal treatises on land reform sold on the market should not be used as formal references; to avoid confusion of thought and disruption of the pace of land reform.
