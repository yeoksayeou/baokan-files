Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: Trygve Lie, the United Nations Secretary-General who is increasingly becoming a tool of the American aggressive war, is further scrounging for cannon fodder for the United States in order to rescue the American interventionist troops trapped in the Korean quagmire. According to a Success Lake dispatch from the United States Information Service: Lie declared at a press conference on the 14th that he had sent a notice that day to the governments of 52 United Nations member states stating: "The Unified Command (the U.S. government) urgently needs more effective assistance. Therefore, if your government is willing to consider the possibility of providing such assistance, including combat troops, especially ground troops, I would be very grateful." Lie also said that the notice stipulated that with regard to providing military assistance, it is only necessary to notify the United Nations Secretary-General in general terms, and as for "detailed methods, your government can deal directly with the Unified Command, namely the U.S. government." When a reporter asked whether Lie's "notice" required "symbolic" troops, Lie replied: "No, I think they should give really effective assistance." According to Agence France-Presse: "Lie issued the above request after the United States made a proposal."

　　妄图援救陷在朝鲜的干涉军
    赖伊为美帝搜罗炮灰
    【新华社十六日讯】日益成为美国侵略战争工具的联合国秘书长赖伊正在进一步为美国搜罗炮灰。以援救陷在朝鲜泥沼里的美国干涉军。据美国新闻处成功湖讯：赖伊十四日在记者招待会上宣称，他已于当日向五十二个联合国会员国的政府发出通知说：“统一指挥部（美国政府）正迫切需要更多的有效援助。因此，如果贵政府愿考虑提供此种援助的可能性，包括战斗部队，特别是陆地部队，我当非常感激。”赖伊并说，通知中规定：关于提供军事援助，只需笼统地通知联合国秘书长即可，至于“详细的办法，则可由贵政府与统一指挥部，即美国政府直接处理”。当记者问及赖伊的“通知”是否要求“象征性”的部队时，赖伊答称：“不，我认为它们应给予真正有效的援助。”据法新社消息：“赖伊是在美国提出建议后才发出上项请求的。”
