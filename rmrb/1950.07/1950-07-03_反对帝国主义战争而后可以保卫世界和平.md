Opposing Imperialist War is the Path to Defending World Peace
    Peng Zemin
    For the past hundred years, the Chinese people have lived under wars (both civil and foreign) manipulated and supported by imperialism. The damage suffered during World War II was particularly unparalleled. The Chinese people have suffered greatly from imperialist wars, and therefore, they hate and oppose imperialist wars of aggression the most. War is inseparable from imperialism; to oppose war, one must oppose imperialism. Today, the Chinese people have achieved liberation, independence, and democracy thanks to the arduous struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people for over thirty years, relying on the assistance of the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. These two experiences tell us that anti-imperialism and anti-war cannot be opposed in isolation, and defending peace cannot be defended in isolation. We must extensively unite all peace-loving and democratic people in the world to work together to more effectively stop war and consolidate peace. This is the principle of "leaning to one side" as instructed by Chairman Mao.

　　反对帝国主义战争而后可以保卫世界和平
    彭泽民
    中国人民过去一百多年来始终在帝国主义所操纵支持的战争（内战外战）下过日子，尤其是第二次大战所受的损害更世无伦比，中国人民是受尽帝国主义战争的苦痛的，所以中国人民也就最痛恨，最反对帝国主义侵略战争的。战争与帝国主义是分不开的，要反对战争就要反对帝国主义。今天中国人民所以能够达到解放独立和民主、皆由中国共产党和中国人民经过三十多年来坚苦奋斗并依靠了以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营的帮助而获得的。这两条经验告诉我们：反帝反战不能孤立去反对的，保卫和平也不能孤立去保卫的。我们必须广泛的联合团结世界上一切爱好和平民主人士来共同努力，才能更有效的制止战争巩卫和平，这就是毛主席所指示的“一面倒”的道理。
