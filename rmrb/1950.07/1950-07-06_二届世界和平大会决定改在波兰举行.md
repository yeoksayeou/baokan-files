　　Xinhua News Agency, July 5th dispatch from Paris: The Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace issued a statement regarding the Italian government's decision to refuse entry visas to delegates to the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace, originally scheduled to be held in Genoa this October. The statement said: Considering that the declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons will form the basis of the work of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace; and that the Italian people are actively signing the Stockholm Appeal to demonstrate their loyalty to the cause of peace and freedom, the Secretariat of the Standing Committee expresses deep regret at the Italian government's decision. This decision runs counter to the urgent need of the people to defend peace.
    The Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace has decided to request the Polish Committee of Supporters of Peace to take all necessary steps to convene the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Poland from October 16th to 21st of this year.

　　二届世界和平大会决定改在波兰举行
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会就意大利政府拒绝发给原定于本年十月在热那亚召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会代表入境签证的决定，发表声明称：鉴于要求禁止原子武器的宣言，将成为世界拥护和平大会工作的基础；而且，意大利人民为表示其对和平及自由事业的忠诚，正积极地在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，和大常委会秘书处对意大利政府的决定，深表遗憾。这一决定是与人民保卫和平的迫切需要背道而驰的。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会秘书处已决定请求波兰拥护和平委员会为本年度十月十六日至二十一日在波兰召开第二届世界拥护和平大会一事，采取一切必要的步骤。
