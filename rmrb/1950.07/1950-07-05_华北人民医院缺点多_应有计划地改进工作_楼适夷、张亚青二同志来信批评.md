　　Many Shortcomings at North China People's Hospital; Work Should Be Improved Systematically
　　Lou Shiyi and Zhang Yaqing Criticize in Letters

　　(I) Editor Comrade:

　　I have wanted to write this letter for a long time, but I was afraid of being too subjective, so I have been cautious and haven't written it. Recently, I have received some new information and deeply feel that further delay would be irresponsible to the people.

　　My child, Lou Mengtie, seventeen years old, was usually strong, but suddenly fell ill on January 14th of this year. After being diagnosed and treated at our office's clinic, he was sent to the North China People's Hospital at 9:30 AM on January 15th. At that time, his condition was serious, his pulse was weak, and he was incontinent. It happened to be a Sunday, and after registering for emergency treatment at the hospital, we waited nearly an hour before a doctor came to see him. After examining him, the doctor said it was serious, but couldn't say what the illness was, and didn't administer any emergency treatment. The patient lay in the outpatient room for nearly two hours before being sent to a ward. The nurse made the bed, and then we never saw her again, nor did a doctor come to see him. Before entering the ward, the patient was soiled with feces. Despite repeated urging, no one came to clean him up. Helpless, we had to wait for two hours with the comatose patient before an assistant doctor came to take a drop of blood and give an injection. By this time, it was 2:30 PM, five hours after arriving at the hospital. After that, there was no further news. Due to work commitments, I had to leave temporarily and asked the nurse to take care of him. She said, "You go ahead, we will take care of him." I went back to the hospital at 6:30 PM and still found the patient lying comatose in bed, soiled with urine and feces, the bedding disarranged, and no one attending to him. I went to ask the doctor about the blood test results. He said that the white blood cell count was high, suggesting inflammation, but still couldn't make a diagnosis. I asked if we could give him penicillin first. He said that it would be given, and he had gone to buy the medicine. He also told me that he had been given glucose once in the afternoon. After that, still no nurse or doctor came to the ward. After waiting and urging, penicillin was finally administered at almost 8:00 PM. From then on, the patient's breathing became more and more rapid. Seeing that the situation was not right, I went everywhere to find a doctor. After searching for a long time, I finally found one who gave a cardiac stimulant injection, and then the doctor disappeared again. Suddenly, the child murmured something and then stopped breathing. I rushed to find a doctor to give another cardiac stimulant injection, but of course, it was no use. This was at 8:45 PM, eleven hours after arriving at the hospital. Then the nurse came to call me, saying that the director of medical affairs wanted to see me to announce that the child was beyond hope. I asked to investigate the cause of death, but he vaguely said that the white blood cell count was very high, suspected leukemia, but there were also bone marrow cells in the blood, and the cause was unknown. That night, the fecal matter was only washed off the body when it was being prepared. The next day, we made a phone appointment to see the president at 9:00 AM. We waited in the reception room for two hours. The comrade from our office's general affairs department, who came with me, couldn't stand it any longer and took the initiative to find the president, who gave us the death certificate. The diagnosis was severe acute leukemia (myelogenous), and the cause of death was heart failure. We requested an autopsy to investigate the illness. Initially, they excused themselves saying that the hospital lacked the equipment and didn't think it was necessary. After our firm request, they decided to send it to Peking University Hospital for autopsy. After the autopsy and burial of the body, two weeks passed without them telling us the results. After urging again and again, they finally sent an official document. Although the autopsy report also diagnosed leukemia, the cause of death was acute pneumonia, which was inconsistent with the death certificate. Also, in the medical records sent by the hospital, the number of times and the timing of medication did not match the actual situation. At that time, our office's secretariat reported to the Ministry of Health. I heard that the Ministry of Health decided to convene a meeting of the hospital and family members to discuss the matter, but we never received a notice. Due to my work commitments, this matter was delayed. Recently, several comrades from our office who were treated and recuperating at the hospital have personally experienced many instances of the hospital's irresponsibility towards patients, which makes me feel that there is serious bureaucratic style at the North China People's Hospital, and there has been little improvement. I think this is a national hospital directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, and many cadres on the supply system are sent there when they are ill. If their bureaucratic style of irresponsibility towards patients is not corrected, the problem will be very serious.

　　I take full responsibility for reporting this fact to you, and I hope that you will publish this letter as soon as possible, and request the Central People's Inspection Department and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government to conduct a thorough inspection of the hospital's leadership and overall work, and to require the responsible comrades of the North China People's Hospital to conduct strict self-criticism, correct their work style, and take on the responsibility of serving the people.

　　(II) Editor Comrade:

　　I was hospitalized at the North China People's Hospital for more than a month (May 21 - June 26) for a stomach ulcer and discovered the following conditions at the hospital:

　　1. Environmental hygiene work is very poor. The entire hospital has thirteen or fourteen toilets, managed by only one person, and another thirteen or fourteen people in the cleaning crew do not take care of the toilets. Foul water overflows from the sides of the toilets, and there are many small mosquitoes and flies, and even flies have been found in the food many times. One afternoon I drank half a bowl of slightly spoiled milk and had diarrhea five or six times in a row in the middle of the night.

　　2. Medical staff are not serious and responsible enough. Doctors generally lack the patience to answer patients' questions (improved after suggestions were made). Hospital rules have not yet been established. The president and director of medical affairs rarely go to the wards, do not inspect the work, and do not understand the situation below. Some patients develop mental illness during their hospitalization. Once, a patient was crying and walking in the hallway, wanting to see the president (it is said that this patient also has mental illness). A nurse and I went to ask for the president. The president had just woken up from his midday nap. I waited outside the door for half an hour, calling him three times, before he came out.

　　3. Doctors, nurses, and workers are not united enough, the responsibility is unclear, and there is not enough contact between them. This was personally discussed with me by a director within the hospital. When I first entered the hospital, I saw a wall newspaper called "Democratic Life" in the corridor. The articles on it were very old, scattered, and later torn off. The thumbtacks on it were already rusty.

　　I discussed the above situation with the director of internal medicine, and he said he accepted my opinion. Later, it was said that a meeting was held to arrange a week of concentrated work. The second meeting invited eight or nine patients to participate (I was one of the invited patients) for discussion. I was discharged from the hospital soon after. From the situation before I left the hospital, it seems that the leading comrades of the hospital have the sincerity to improve their work. Although there are many problems, as long as they are systematically rectified, the staff's thinking is clarified, the democratic system is improved, and inspection and supervision are strengthened, the above-mentioned shortcomings should be gradually overcome.

### 华北人民医院缺点多  应有计划地改进工作  楼适夷、张亚青二同志来信批评

　　华北人民医院缺点多  应有计划地改进工作
    楼适夷、张亚青二同志来信批评
   （一）编辑同志：
    我很久想写这封信，恐怕自己太主观，一直谨慎着没写。最近又得到一些新的材料，深感再拖延下去，实在对人民太不负责了。
    我的孩子楼孟铁十七岁，平素身体强壮，于今年一月十四日突然得病，经我署医务所诊治，于一月十五日上午九时半送到华北人民医院，当时形势严重，脉搏微弱，粪便失禁。这天恰巧是星期，到医院挂急诊号后差不多等了近一小时才有医生来看。医生看后也说很严重，但说不出什么病，也没施急救方法。病人在门诊室足足躺了近两个钟头，才送进病房里。看护铺好了被服，从此不再见面，也没有医生来看。入病房前病人身上污了粪便，再三催促，也没人来料理，没有办法，只好面对昏迷的病人等了两个钟头，才有助理医生来采了一滴血，打了一针。这时已二时半，离到院已五小时了。从此又没音讯，我因工作关系，不得不暂时离开一下，又去找看护交代，她说你去好了，我们会照顾。我到晚上六时半又去医院，仍见病人昏迷地躺在床上，便溺淋漓，床铺零乱，没人看顾。又去找医生问验血结果，说是白血球很多，想是炎症，但仍断不定。我问可否先打盘尼西林，他说要打的，去买药了。他还告诉我，下午打过一次葡萄糖。这以后，依然没有看护和医生上病房来，又等又催，到快八时，才打了盘尼西林。从此病人越喘越急，我看形势不对，又去到处找医生，找了好久才找来了，打了一枚强心针，医生又不见了。忽然孩子含糊地唤了一声，就没有气了。急忙找医生再打强心针，当然没有用了，这时候是八时四十五分，离到院十一小时。那时看护来叫我，说医务主任来叫我，宣布孩子已绝望了。我要求追究病因，他只含混地说白血球很多，疑似白血病，但血液内还有骨髓细胞，不知什么原因。当晚直到处理尸体时，才洗去了身上的粪污。第二天电话约定九时去看院长，在会客室枯候两小时，和我同去的我署总务科同志耐不住了，主动地去找才找到院长，交给我们死亡诊断书。诊断为严急性白血病（骨髓性），死亡原因为心脏麻痹。我们要求解剖尸体查验病情，起初推托院中设备不够，认为可以不必，经我们坚决要求，才决定送北大医院解剖。解剖后安葬了尸体，又足足过了两个星期没有把结果告诉我们，催了又催，才来了一个公文。我们医务所同志去要解剖书全文，又再三推托，甚至态度很不好，最后才抄来了一份。解剖书虽然也断了白血病，但死亡原因是急性肺炎，和死亡诊断书不符；又在医院送来的医历上，用药的次数、时间和实际并不符合。当时我署秘书处曾报告卫生部，听说卫生部决定召集医院及家属会谈研究，但后来也未接到通知。我因工作关系，这事件就拖延下去了。最近有我署几位同志在该院治病及疗养的，亲身体验到该院对病人不负责任的许多事实，使我感觉华北人民医院存在严重的官僚主义作风，始终很少改进。我想这是中央人民政府卫生部直接领导下的国家医院，许多供给制干部有病都往那儿送。他们那样对病人不负责任的官僚主义作风，如再不纠正，问题实在太严重了。
    我负完全责任向你们申诉这个事实，希望你们很快的把这封信发表出来，要求中央人民检查署和中央人民政府卫生部对该院的领导和整个工作进行彻底的检查，并要华北人民医院负责同志作严格自我检讨，改正作风，担负起为人民服务的责任。

   （二）编辑同志：
    我因胃溃疡在华北人民医院住了一个多月（五月二十一——六月二十六），发现医院的情况如下：
    一、环境卫生工作做得很不好。全院有十三四个厕所，只有一人管理，另有十三四人的清洁班不管厕所。厕所边臭水外溢，小蚊子和苍蝇很多，甚至在饮食中也多次发现苍蝇。我有一天下午喝了半碗有点变味的牛奶，半夜接连泻了五六次。
    二、医务人员不够认真负责。医生一般缺乏耐心回答病人询问的精神（提意见后有改进）。病院规则至今尚未建立。院长、医务主任很少到病房去，不检查工作，对下面情况不了解。有的病人在住院期间发生神经病。有一次，一个病人哭着在走廊上走，要见院长（据说这病人也有神经病）。我和一个护士去请院长，院长正午睡起来，我在门外足足等了半个钟头，喊他三次，他才出门。
    三、医生护士工友之间不够团结，责任不清，彼此联系不够。这是院内一个主任亲自和我谈的。本人初进院时，见走廊上有《民主生活》壁报，上面的文章都很久了，零零落落，后来都给撕下了，上面的别针已经发锈了。
    以上情形，我曾向内科主任当面谈过，他表示接受我的意见。后来据说开过会，布置一星期的突击工作。第二次开会曾邀八九个病员参加（我是被邀病员之一）讨论。不久我便出院了。从我离院前情形看来，该院领导同志改进工作的诚意是有的。问题虽多，但只要有计划地加以整顿，搞通工作人员的思想，健全民主制度，加强检查督促工作，上述的缺点是应该能够逐步克服的。
