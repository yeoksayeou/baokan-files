    Universally Launches Self-Criticism to Examine Bureaucratic Work Style
    [Our Zhangjiakou News] The Zhangjiakou Railway Factory of the Tianjin Railway Administration is enthusiastically launching criticism and self-criticism, fighting against bureaucracy. Under planned and systematic leadership, the factory has convened criticism and self-examination meetings separately. The meetings revealed many deviations in ideological understanding and work style, manifested in being detached from reality, insufficiently democratic, and emphasizing subjectivity, carelessness, and bureaucracy. For example, at the examination meeting for director-level cadres (including members of the trade union and the management committee), factory director Wang Guiqing said: "My thinking is still not correct, and I am unwilling to tell people about some things, or I am afraid of offending people. My work style is also not democratic enough, and I am sometimes too subjective. For example, regarding the problem of sand holes in cylinder liner casting, I subjectively believed that burying it in the soil would not be easy to improve. In the end, veteran workers Zheng Ru Lun and Wang Jin Xing came up with ideas to improve it." Branch Secretary Zhang Guang also made a self-criticism, saying: "I sometimes have impatience, and this phenomenon exists in job evaluation and salary assessment. Because I have worked in regional work for a long time in the past, I have a guerrilla nature. To some extent, a bureaucratic work style still exists." Trade Union Director Wang Shiming also examined his ideas of monopolizing everything and vying for credit. In the material inventory, Zhao Jiwu, director of the material room, did not have enough prior arrangements, plans, inspections, and supervision, so that the masses had nowhere to put the recovered parts during the sorting process, which wasted manpower instead. In addition to self-examination, he also examined his erroneous idea of underestimating the strength of the masses. In addition, many leading comrades have made the mistake of being preoccupied with routine affairs, spending almost all of their working time on all the tables, reports, and plans in the office, and rarely going deep into the field to understand the situation. Some, when encountering difficulties in their work or when they are too busy with affairs, just muddle through. Some have no plan for their work and lack research. They also made self-examinations at the general criticism meeting.

     张家口铁路工厂       
     普遍开展自我批评检查官僚主义作风
    【本报张家口讯】天津铁路管理局张家口铁路工厂，热烈展开批评与自我批评，向官僚主义作斗争。该厂在有计划有步骤的领导下，分别召开了批评检讨会。会中发现很多思想认识和作风的偏差，表现在脱离实际，不够民主，和强调主观、粗枝大叶、官僚主义等方面。例如在主任级干部（包括工会及管委会委员）检查会中，厂长王桂清说：“我的思想还不够正确，有的事件不愿告诉人，或怕得罪人。在作风上也不太民主，有时太主观，例如关于汽缸套翻砂出砂眼问题，我主观地认为在土内埋着，不易改良。结果还是由老工友郑汝伦、王锦星想法改进了。”支书张光同志也作了自我批评，他说：“我有时犯急躁病，在评职评薪中都有这种现象。因过去作地区工作时间较长，带有游击性。在某种程度上，还存在官僚主义作风。”工会主任王世铭也检讨了自己的包办代替和争功思想。材料室主任赵继武在清点材料中，事前的布置、计划、检查、督促都不够，以致群众在整理中收回配件没处放，反而浪费了人力，他除对此作了自我检讨外，并检讨了对群众力量估计太低的错误思想。此外，很多领导同志犯了事务主义的毛病，每天几乎把全部工作时间消耗在室内的一切表报计划上，很少时间深入现场去了解情况。有的在工作中遇到困难，或事务忙的不可开交时，便得过且过地搪塞下去。有的对工作没计划，缺乏研究。在全体批评大会上，也都做了检讨。
