　　"East Horizon" in the Wilderness
    Visiting a Certain Regiment of the Fourth Field Army Striving Hard on the Production Front
    Wu Shaoqi

    I
    Thirty *li* east of Bei'an City, Heilongjiang Province, there is a small village of a dozen or so households called "Koumenzi." Forty *li* east of this is the "East Horizon," a vast wilderness.
    The people's own troops of Northeast China—a certain regiment of the Fourth Field Army—were ordered to come to this "East Horizon" to carry out a "production team" mission. Among the Fourth Field Army's production units, their task is the heaviest: each person must hand over 500 *jin* of grain to the state this year, and all livestock and carts must be self-sufficient. Including the recovery of investment and dividends, each person must produce 2,000 *jin* of grain this year. Among the production units in various parts of Northeast China, their conditions are the worst: here, although there are black dots on the map like Wuyu Town and Laodengwo, in reality, in that undulating hilly area, there are only weeds, cogon grass, and mud ponds. Transportation is inconvenient. As soon as you leave "Koumenzi," there is a three-*li* stretch of wet, swampy grassland, and even a cart carrying only 300 *jin* of goods will get stuck. It is unbelievably cold. When the leaves in Shenyang are already providing shade, the hazel branches here are just budding. But the "East Horizon" also has its lovely aspects: a vast expanse of uncultivated "virgin land" is boundless, suitable for establishing large-scale farms. The "brown forest soil," more than two *chi* deep, is loose and fertile, and it doesn't matter if fertilizer isn't applied for seven or eight years, guaranteeing harvests regardless of drought or flood. Our troops will create beautiful farms in such a place.

    In March, the soldiers came here in batches, erected tents on snow that was a *chi* deep, ate frozen dry rations, drank melted snow water heated by fire, wore single hats suitable for the southern climate to resist the cold wind, wore summer cloth shoes to step on muddy snow, and felled trees, cut grass, built houses, and dug wells. There were not many tools. Some used their feet to mix mud, and some used their hands as mud boards to plaster walls. Timber, grass, and grain were all carried by manpower from the muddy, snowy ground. Some got lost in the wilderness and camped outside. After Regiment Commander Wang Xingzhong arrived, he also reached out to plaster mud and went up the mountain to carry timber... After two months of intense labor, the first battle was considered over.

    II
    This was only the beginning of the difficulties. The road ahead is still not smooth. When reclamation began, there was another pile of problems: although a training class of more than a hundred people had been held beforehand, the soldiers understood the structure, use, and part names of Western plows in theory. Although most of the soldiers were farmers and not unskilled in farming, the hands that were accustomed to handling guns and cannons were always unfamiliar when they came to hold Western plows. No matter how hard you tried to hold the plow handle like pushing a cart, it would not be obedient: it would swing left and right, sometimes deep, sometimes shallow, sometimes wide, sometimes narrow. Before you went far, you would be sweating profusely. As soon as the plowshare of the sixth squad of the first battalion entered the soil, it would attack a grass hummock and could not be pulled out, bending the plow beam.
    Most of the animals pulling the plows were packhorses from the company that carried heavy machine guns and mortars. Suddenly asking them to pull plows was also "unprofessional." Six animals would go one east, one west, some would not go at all, and they would jump around when hit. Some were even more fierce and simply would not let themselves be harnessed. Some companies had to use six or seven people to manage the animals. But the driving slogans were different. Some shouted artillery commands, some shouted cart team commands. Southerners shouted "Wo," while Northeasterners shouted "Jia," making them even more confused. On the first day, the first battalion had two "plow noses" kicked off by the animals. In addition, the quality of the Western plows themselves was not good. Each company broke a lot. On the first day, the third battalion broke five out of ten. Some were just repaired and then broken again. As a result, a large Western plow with six animals could only reclaim two to three *mu* of wasteland a day. The companies heard the argument that "this year's task cannot be completed," and some soldiers cried anxiously.

    Political Commissar × said well: "This is an inevitable transition process." The people who had climbed the steep cliffs of the Funiu Mountain peak were not hindered by such difficulties for long. The first battalion reorganized manpower and animals, and the second squad first selected a good piece of land for trial cultivation. It was easier for both people and animals, and there were no major problems. Several comrades in the second battalion who had worked as carpenters studied with the company commander to make wooden plow beams to replace the broken iron plow beams, which were easy to use and would not break. Gradually, each company established land selection groups and repair groups, and tried to cultivate areas with fewer grass hummocks and dry and loose soil first. If the plow had problems, it would be "treated" immediately. The soldiers held a review meeting every night to exchange and study experiences. The technology gradually became proficient. As soon as the plow entered the soil, they could immediately judge where it was not installed properly. After a period of training, the animals also learned how to pull. In this way, each plow increased from two to three *mu* per day to seven to eight *mu*, with a maximum of twelve *mu*. At the beginning, it took seven or eight people to manage one plow, but now only three people are needed.

    Mastering the agricultural season is like mastering the timing of operations, especially in this northern wilderness with a short frost-free period. If the crops are not sown in time, they will be hit by frost and all the hard work of the year will be in vain. The soldiers lived a tense life like the Liaoxi-Shenyang Campaign. They went to the fields as soon as it dawned and returned only when the sun set. Lunch was eaten in the fields. All the animals were used for reclaiming wasteland with plows, and planters, disc harrows, and stone rollers were all pulled by people. Another group of people dug pits with hoes to plant soybeans. Everyone was thinking of ways to do more work. Some tied small shovels used for digging fortifications to wooden poles to use as hoes, and some made large wooden hammers to break up soil clumps. The small Western plows of the ninth squad of the first battalion plowed one *mu* less than the large plows every day. They studied adding a soil-turning board to the back of the plowshare so that the number of *mu* reclaimed each day was equal to that of the large plows. A platoon of the anti-aircraft gun company, which was responsible for planting vegetables, actually reclaimed five and a half *xiang* of virgin land entirely by pulling plows with people. "See you at the celebration meeting after the autumn harvest!" was everyone's resounding slogan for the competition. "In the past, we shed blood to conquer the world, now we sweat more for construction" was their unanimous will.

    III

    The newly built life in this remote wilderness is like this:

    The houses can only be called "earth shelters" or "horse sheds" because they returned from inside the pass later and the season did not allow for full preparation. Some window frames are just a few branches, and some hang a straw curtain to replace window paper. The regimental headquarters—the production command post—is together with the kitchen. Every day, the regimental commander plans work and commands the troops in the glaring smoke.

    It is more than eighty *li* from here to Bei'an. Although each company sends three comrades to transport vegetables back and forth, the quantity is also limited. When they first arrived, they ate fried bean cakes, and now they can only eat potatoes. No matter how it is changed—eating shreds, slices, or chunks—potatoes are always potatoes.

    The ground is very wet, and water immediately gushes out when the soil is turned over. The feet of the soldiers holding the plow are wet all day long, and the heels of many people have cracked. Those who are used to holding gun barrels have arms that burn like fire after swinging a large hoe for a day, and blisters have also formed on their hands.

    But the soldiers are worried about not completing the task and do not complain about these things at all. One soldier said at a discussion meeting: "From head to toe, including food and clothing, a soldier costs more than 2.9 million RMB a year. If we participate in production, how much burden can we reduce for the people!" Deputy Political Instructor Shi of the anti-aircraft gun company said when talking about life: "The people in the disaster area of Henan are still eating tree leaves! Thinking of them, what is our suffering?" They know why they are producing today, and they know that the people in the disaster area are living even more bitterly than they are. Therefore, they do not plan for life. The People's Liberation Army fights in the front, produces in the front, and endures hardships in the front.

    IV

    Now the "East Horizon" has begun to change. On the gentle slopes of the hills, patches of oily black fertile soil have replaced the weeds. The green wheat seedlings are more than three *cun* long, and hemp is also showing tender buds. Our troops have conquered the wilderness and sown the seeds of victory. Although there are still many difficulties, it can be affirmed that they will all be overcome one by one.

　　荒野千里的“东天边”
    访问在生产战线上艰苦斗争的四野某团
    吴少琦
    一
    黑龙江省北安城东三十里有个十几户人家的小村子名叫“口门子”。由这往东走上四十里，就是荒野千里的“东天边”。
    东北人民子弟兵——第四野战军某团奉命来到这“东天边”，执行“生产队”任务。在四野的生产部队中，他们的任务最重：每个人今年要缴给国家五百斤粮，牲口、大车更要全部自给，加上收回投资和分红，一个人今年要生产两千斤粮食才行。在东北各个地方的生产部队里，他们的条件最坏：这里，在地图上虽然有什么乌鱼镇、老等窝的黑点，实际上在那起伏不平的丘陵地带，只有野草、茅棵、泥塘。交通不方便，一出“口门子”，就是一段三里长的湿洼的草地，只拉三百斤东西的大车也会陷进去。冷得令人难以置信。当沈阳树叶已经蔽荫的时候，这里的榛枝却刚刚出芽。但“东天边”也有它可爱的地方，一片未开垦的“处女地”广阔无垠，适于建立大规模的农场，二尺多深的“褐色森林土壤”松软肥沃，七、八年不上粪没关系，旱涝保收。我们的队伍，就要在这样的地方创建美丽的农庄。
    三月，战士们就分批来到这里，在深达一尺的雪地上搭起帐棚，吃冰冻的干粮，喝用火烤化的雪水，戴着适合南方气候的单帽抗冷风，穿着夏天的洒鞋踏泥雪，伐木、割草、盖房、打井。工具不多，和泥时有的用脚踩，抹墙时有的用手当泥板。木料、草、粮食，全是人力从泥泞的冰雪地上背来。有的在野地里迷了道，就在外边露营。王兴中团长来了以后，也伸手抹泥，上山抗木头……。紧张劳动了两个月，算是打完了头一仗。
    二
    这还只是困难的开始，前进的道路上仍不平坦。开荒开始，问题又是一大堆：虽然事前曾开办过一个百余人的训练班，战士们从理论上懂得了洋犁的构造、用法、零件名称。虽然战士们绝大部分都是农民出身，对种地并不外行，但已摆弄惯了枪炮的双手，一旦来扶洋犁总是不熟，任你像推小车一样地用力扶犁柄，它也不老实：左右乱摆、时深时浅、时宽时窄，走不上多远，就累的满头大汗。一营六班的犁铧刚一进土就攻在草墩上拔不出来，弄弯了犁辕。
    拉犁的牲口，绝大部分都是连队里驮重机枪、迫击炮的驮马，突然叫它们拉犁也是“外行”。六匹牲口，一个向东一个向西，有的根本不走，一打就乱蹦，更厉害的干脆就不让套，有的连只好用六、七个人管牲口。但驾驭口号不同，喊炮兵口令的，喊大车队口令的，南方人喊“喔”，东北人就喊“驾”，弄的它们更加糊涂，一营第一天就被牲口蹶坏了两个“犁鼻”。这样，再加上洋犁本身质量也不好，每个连都拉坏了很多，三营第一天，十付就坏五付，有的刚修好，又拉坏，结果，六匹牲口的大洋犁，一天只能开出二——三亩荒地。连队里听到了“今年任务完不成”的论调，有的战士急的哭了。
    ×政委说的好：“这是一个必然的转变过程”，攀缘过伏牛山顶峰峭壁的人们，并没有被这样的困难阻住多久。一营把人力牲口重新组织了一遍，二班先选一块好地试耕，人畜都省劲，没出大毛病。二营几个做过木匠的同志和连长研究做木犁辕来代替已经拉断的铁犁辕，好使、不会断。逐渐各连便都成立了选地组、修理组，尽量选草墩少、干松的先垦，犁出了毛病马上就“治疗”。战士们每天晚上都开个评论会，交换、研究经验。技术慢慢熟练了，犁一进土，马上能判断出什么地方没按好。牲口们经过一个时期的训练，也学会了怎样拉。这样，每张犁每天从二——三亩上升到七、八亩，最高达到十二亩。开始时得七、八个人发一张犁，现在只用三个人就行了。
    掌握农业季节和掌握作战时机一样，特别是在这无霜期较短的北大荒，如不抓紧种下去，庄稼就会遭霜而白白辛劳一年，战士们过起和辽西会战时一样的紧张日子。天放亮就下地，太阳落才回来，午饭都在地里吃。牲口全部用到开荒犁上去，播种机、圆盘耙、木磙全用人来拉，另一部分人就一镐一镐地刨坑种大豆。人人在想办法多出活，有的把挖工事用的小锹绑上木杆当镐用，有的用木头做个大槌打土块，一营九班的小型洋犁每天比大犁要少耕一亩，他们研究把犁铧后边也加上个拨土板，使每天开荒亩数和大型犁相等。担任种菜任务的平射炮连一个排，竟完全用人拉犁开了五垧半生荒。“秋后庆功会上见！”是大家竞赛的响亮口号。“过去流血打天下，现在建设多流汗”，是他们一致的意志。
    三
    在这偏僻的荒野里新建设起来的生活是这样：
    房子，只能叫做“地窝棚”或“马架”，因为从关内回来较晚，而季节又不允许充分准备，有些窗棂只是几根树枝，有的挂一张草帘就代替窗纸。团部——生产指挥所，是和伙房在一起，团长同志每天就在刺眼的烟火气中筹划工作，指挥部队。
    这里离北安八十多里，每个连队虽抽出三个同志专门来回运菜，数量也是有限，刚来时，他们吃过炒豆饼，现在也只能吃土豆，无论怎样变，吃丝、吃片、吃块，但土豆总是土豆。
    地里很湿，泥土翻过马上涌出水来，扶犁战士的两支脚整天是湿的，好些人的脚踵已经龟裂。拿惯枪杆子的人，抡一天大镐，两个膀子像火烧一样，手上也都打起血泡。
    但，战士们愁的是怕完不成任务，对这些却毫不哼气。一个战士在讨论会上说过：“从头上到脚下，连吃带穿，一年一个兵得二百九十多万人民币，如果我们参加生产，能给老百姓减轻多少负担啊！”平射炮连的史副指导员在谈起生活时说过：“河南灾区的老百姓还吃树叶呢！想起他们，我们这苦算啥？”他们知道今天生产是为什么，他们知道灾区的人民比他们过得更苦，因此，他们并不盘算生活，人民解放军战斗在前，生产在前，吃苦也走在前边。
    四
    现在“东天边”已经开始变样了。丘陵的漫坡上代替荒草出现了成片油黑的沃土，青青的麦苗已经三寸多长，大麻也露出嫩芽，我们的队伍已征服了荒野，播下胜利的种子，虽然困难还很多，但总会一一克服也可以肯定。
