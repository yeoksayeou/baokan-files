　　North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to Launch July Production Competition
    Full Preparations Made, Confident in Improving Quality
    [This newspaper dispatch] Reporter Lan Cun reports: The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory will launch a July production competition to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. All factory workers will strive to overfulfill the production task of 2,500 walking plows and assemble 361 seed selectors and other agricultural tools. The central slogan of the competition is: reduce costs, improve quality. The leadership has also called on workers to launch a rationalization proposal campaign to create new production records. Since the victorious conclusion of the Red May production competition, the entire factory, from the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League to every employee, has begun preparations for the July production competition with infinite joy and excitement. First, labor was rationally allocated. Each workshop production team has been divided into smaller teams of about ten people, from the previous large teams of twenty or thirty people. In this way, the division of labor is more refined, and if certain adjustments to the allocation of labor are needed during the competition, it will not have too much impact and affect production. At the same time, the actual number of work hours required by each workshop has been calculated in detail and adjusted before the team divisions. Second, after discussion by the workers, important systems have been established or improved, such as material requisition, tool storage, daily consumption of raw materials, and reward and punishment methods, which were announced and implemented on July 1. Third, sufficient preparations have been made for the supply of materials to ensure that production will not be stopped due to lack of materials during the competition. Fourth, in terms of technical preparations, the drawings of the walking plow have been prepared and are not expected to change significantly; in the June production, the quality of horse steel has been significantly improved, directly guaranteeing the quality of products in the foundry workshop; technical personnel from the inspection department will also go to the site to inspect the finished products from the first model inspection of the first machine produced at any time. The waste product exhibition method in May is also prepared to continue to be used. On the basis of these preparations, the factory is confident in improving product quality in July. The requirement that the scrap rate for the foundry shop in July should not exceed 8 percent can be fully achieved. Fifth, in terms of leadership, the re-election of the labor union was completed at the end of June. Each workshop has organized a labor union committee, and the labor union group and the production group have been unified. The leadership of the labor union in the competition will be able to play a greater role than in the past. In addition, the Party and Youth League leadership have called on Party and Youth League members to strive to be shock workers, creators of new records, and models for enforcing labor discipline and uniting all technical personnel and workers.
    In addition to the above preparations, many difficulties that may arise during the competition have been estimated. One of the biggest difficulties is that completing the July production task requires more than 58,000 3/4-inch screws. Due to the limitations of manpower and equipment, the administrative department originally planned to outsource some of them. However, the workers believe that it is a shame not to complete their tasks entirely by themselves, and insist on doing it themselves. After thorough discussions among the relevant departments and workers, it was decided that a large press and riveting machine could be used to concentrate a part of the manpower to rush to manufacture them in advance. This problem was then solved. Another problem is the estimation that workers may increase sick leave due to intense production in the hot weather. For this reason, preparations have been made to conduct extensive health education for workers, calling on everyone not to drink cold water, and requiring Party and Youth League members to lead by example. Necessary improvements will be made in terms of health facilities, and food hygiene will be inspected. The goal is to strive for an attendance rate of no less than 90% in mid-July.
    The factory workers, in coordination with the leadership's preparations, have generally inspected their production weapons—machines. The lathe workshop has repaired the lathes, and the forging workshop has also repaired the main tools. The model team of the foundry workshop has even challenged the other teams in the workshop. In recent days, workers have been enthusiastically discussing team plans and individual plans. It is estimated that the competition will begin immediately after the celebration of the Party's birthday.

　　华北农业机械总厂将展开七月生产竞赛
    已充分做好准备工作，有把握提高质量
    【本报讯】记者蓝村报道：华北农业机械总厂为了庆祝中国共产党诞生二十九周年纪念日，将开展七月生产竞赛运动。全厂职工，将为超额完成二千五百部步犁及装配三百六十一部精选机等农具的生产任务而奋斗。竞赛的中心口号是：减低成本，提高质量。领导上并号召工人展开合理化建议运动，创造生产新纪录。该厂自胜利结束红五月的生产竞赛运动以后，全厂从党、政、工、团到每个职工，即以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情，开始了七月生产竞赛的准备工作。首先，合理配备了劳动力。各车间生产小组，已由过去二、三十人的大组，划成了十人左右的小组。这样，分工更加精细，且在竞赛中如劳动力的配备需要某些调整时，不致牵动太大而影响生产。同时，各车间实际需要的工数已经过详细计算，在划组前作了调整。第二，经过工人讨论，建立或健全了重要制度，如材料领取，工具保管，原、材料每日消耗量，及奖惩办法等，七月一日公布施行。第三，材料的供给，已作了充分准备，保证竞赛中不致停工待料。第四，技术准备方面，步犁图样已制好，估计不会有大变更；六月份生产中，马钢质量已显著提高，直接保证了铸工间的产品质量；检验科技术人员也将亲到现场，从第一部机器生产第一个模型检验开始，随时检验成品。五月份的废品展览办法也准备继续采用。在这些准备工作的基础上，该厂七月份已有把握提高产品质量。七月份对铸工场提出的废品率不能超过百分之八的要求，完全可以实现。第五，在领导方面，六月末期已完成了工会的改选工作。各车间组织了工会委员会，工会小组与生产小组已统一起来。工会在竞赛中的领导，比过去将能发挥更大的作用。此外，党、团领导上并号召党、团员在生产中争取当突击手、新纪录的创造者和执行劳动纪律与团结全体技术人员和工人群众的模范。
    除了上述准备工作，并估计到竞赛中可能发生的许多困难，其中最大的一个困难，是完成七月的生产任务，需要三分与四分的螺丝五万八千余个。因人力及设备的限制，行政方面原打算包出一部分。但工人们认为自己的任务不由自己全部完成是一种耻辱，坚持要求自己来做。后经各有关部门及工人周详讨论，研究出可以用大压力机、铆钉机，集中一部分人力提前突击制造。此一问题遂告解决。另一问题是估计到工友在伏天紧张生产，可能增加病号。为此，已准备对工人广泛进行卫生教育，号召大家不要喝冷水，并要求党、团员以身作则。在卫生设备方面将作必要的改善及检查饮食卫生。七月中，争取出勤率不低于百分之九十。
    该厂工友配合着领导上的准备工作，普遍检查了自己的生产武器——机器。车工房修理好了车床，锻工房也修理好了主要的工具。铸工房的模型组更向本工场各组提出挑战。最近几天，工人们正在热烈讨论小组计划与个人计划。估计在庆祝过党的生日之后，竞赛会立即开展起来。
