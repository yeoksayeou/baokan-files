　　Railway Trade Union Performing Arts Troupe Active on Jinpu Line
　　[From Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Railways' Youth Cultural Train arrived in Hankou on June 2nd from Zhengzhou, staying in Hankou for twenty days. Subsequently, it participated in the celebration of the founding of the Wudong Railway Sub-bureau and the celebration rally, staying for a week. On July 1st, the train went to Hengyang to participate in the Hengyang Railway Bureau's model worker conference. It now plans to continue its tour to the Changsha Sub-bureau, Liuzhou Sub-bureau, Guangzhou Sub-bureau and other places. While in Hankou, the train performed a total of eighteen programs (including four films) for railway workers, with nearly 40,000 audience members. The train staff also took time to go deep into the working masses to study, inviting veteran workers from the "February 7th" strike to hold discussion meetings, and assisting local railway workers in organizing workers' choirs. At the same time, they collected some typical materials of model workers, and in coordination with the current central task of the railway – unified wage system – wrote plays such as "For Eternal Happiness," "Signing the Contract," and "Locomotive 1224." Among them, the play "For Eternal Happiness," performed in the Hubei dialect, was extremely popular with the workers.
