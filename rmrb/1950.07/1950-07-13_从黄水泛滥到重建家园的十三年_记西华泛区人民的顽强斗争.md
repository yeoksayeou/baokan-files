　　Thirteen Years from the Yellow River Flood to Rebuilding Homes
    A Record of the Tenacious Struggle of the People of the Xihua Flood Area
    By our reporter Lu Sheng
            I
    Thirteen years ago, the people of Xihua County, like those in many counties along the Yellow River, secretly carried out various anti-Japanese activities under the leadership of the local Communist Party organization. Young men flocked to join the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by Communists Wang Qimei and Lu Yanling. In less than a year, this anti-Japanese guerrilla force had expanded to four thousand people. The people of each village also organized themselves one after another, shouting the slogan: "Down with Japan, eliminate traitors!" preparing to deal a head-on blow to the invading Japanese bandits.
    In June 1938, along with the news that the Japanese bandits had crossed the Yellow River, a strange message reached the ears of the Xihua people: "Chiang Kai-shek can't beat Japan, so he breached the Yellow River at Huayuankou, intending to use the Yellow River water to resist Japan." People were still discussing and scolding Chiang Kai-shek for releasing the Yellow River water to flood the common people. But only two or three days later, people shouted in alarm, "The Yellow River water is coming!" The surging Yellow River water rushed from north to south, directly towards the villages and wheat fields. The ditches were filled with Yellow River water, and the nearly ripe barley and wheat were submerged. In an instant, the vast plains, described by the local tyrants and landlords as "green fields and fertile land, full granaries, crowed villages," became a vast ocean! The landlords of Nanling Village, fearing that the Yellow River water would enter their fortress, sealed the village gate, moved their grain and property to brick-built high buildings, and built boats overnight, preparing to move out at any time. The poor people had no boats and lived in thatched houses, so they were anxious and helpless. Ling Xueming, a poor peasant in this village, climbed onto the寨墙 village wall and looked around, and the endless Yellow River water was rising higher and higher. He thought, "There's no hope!" Ling Mengke, who participated in the anti-Japanese guerrillas, and Ling Timin, the leader of the youth team, quickly gathered the poor people and said, "There is no hope. We won't be able to eat this season's wheat. Let's quickly find a way to build boats and escape to famine." So everyone worked together to build boats overnight. Just as four boats were built, the寨墙 village wall was breached by the water. In an instant, the whole village was in an uproar, with people shouting, horses neighing, chickens flying, and dogs barking. Rice and flour were washed away by the Yellow River water, pots and bowls were floating in the water, and thatched houses were washed down. The young people quickly propped up the boats. Ling Timin shouted: "Things are small matters, people are big matters. As long as people can escape, they are not afraid of starving to death." Poor people escaped in piles in the Yellow River water, but the landlords laughed in the high buildings. The landlord Ling Zuoyun was the head of Nanling Village, and he had always opposed the people's anti-Japanese activities. At this time, he laughed and scolded from the楼上 building: "See if you are still 'red' or not!" ("Red" means anti-Japanese revolution.)
    The next year, the Yellow River water receded in some places. With the help of the anti-Japanese guerrillas, some of the common people slowly returned and planted some rice in the paddy fields. That year, the rice grew well, but as soon as the rice was harvested, Chiang Kai-shek sent his 81st Division to encircle and suppress them. They said fiercely: "The people of Xihua are all bad people. They just open the water, but they still want to be 'red', they must be killed." So Chiang's bandit 81st Division went to kill village after village. More than one hundred people were tied up in Nanling Village at one time, and twelve people were buried alive in Xiatin at one time. The rice that people had harvested and the worn-out clothes and bedding they brought when they fled were also robbed by the bandits. From then on, the people of Xihua lived under the double attack of the Yellow River water and Chiang's bandits, and lived a life of ten years of fleeing famine, wandering, hunger, and death. It is difficult to estimate the debt of blood owed to the people of the Yellow River flood area by Chiang Kai-shek who breached the Yellow River embankment!
    After the Japanese surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek's gang changed their tricks again. In order to make the people of Xihua obediently become slaves of American imperialism, he organized dozens of so-called "relief" organizations. Then a group of Americans and British came, carrying a batch of surplus American materials, such as cocoa, chocolate candy, coffee, spices, cod liver oil, and some women's floral clothes and high-heeled shoes. They stayed in Xihua County, saying they were here to "relieve" the people of the Xihua flood area. What did they do in Xihua? First, they found the local tyrants and landlords, eating meat and drinking wine every day, and using the tractors they brought to reclaim wasteland for the landlords; second, they asked the refugees to build roads for cars, preparing to attack the liberated areas; third, they organized "reformatories" to let the landlords' children go to school and listen to lectures on "Americans are good"; fourth, they organized "women's sewing cooperatives," only accepting beautiful young women for their enjoyment; fifth, they distributed chocolate candy, women's floral clothes, and high-heeled shoes. After Xihua County was "relieved" for half a year, many young and beautiful girls were raped by American and Chiang Kai-shek's "relief" officials. An enlightened绅士 gentleman in the city also said angrily: "If we 'relieve' like this for five years, there will be no one left in Xihua City." The American 黑牧士 black pastor, took candy and strolled on the street every day. When he met a child, he would ask the child to salute him first, and then pretend to smile and give the child a piece of candy. Once, a child forgot to salute and touched his trouser legs to ask for candy. The American pastor beat the ignorant child severely.
            II
    The people of Xihua County did not stop their anti-Japanese struggle during the difficult days of the Yellow River flood and fleeing famine. Most of the young people joined the New Fourth Army, and the people who escaped also often went to the Yellow River flood area to work with the guerrillas. They often appeared in the Yellow River窝 depressions and reeds to strike at the Japanese and puppet troops who came out of Xiaoyao Town to grab grain. Once, the Shuixi Guerrilla Detachment and the Nanling Militia seized a large cart of grain from the Japanese, and immediately distributed it to the people who had fled outside. There were many, many things like this.
    In the spring of 1947, after the Yellow River water receded, the landlords living near Zhoukou quickly returned to their villages, and with their money, livestock, and the "Executive Yuan" tractor team, they reclaimed a large amount of wasteland. For example, the large landlord Ling Zuoyun and others in Nanling Village quickly reclaimed fourteen顷 hectares of land after returning to the village. When the farmers who had fled to distant villages returned, the landlords said: "If you want to cultivate the land, I can rent it to you; if you want to reclaim the wasteland, there is also wasteland available." How could the farmers without food or shelter have the strength to reclaim wasteland? After looking at a片片 yellow water窝 depression, they fled again.
    In the autumn of that year, Liu Deng's army crossed the Yellow River. After hearing the good news, the people of Xihua who had fled to the surrounding villages moved back home one after another. The topography of the Xihua area, which had been flooded by the Yellow River for ten years, had changed. When people returned, they could not even recognize their own villages: the thatched houses were all buried by yellow mud, and the big trees were also buried by yellow mud, leaving only a treetop floating on the ground. Everywhere there were yellow water窝 depressions and thin mud and sand. There was no road from this village to that village at all. Many disaster victims returned and could not find their villages for several days. The Shuixi Guerrilla Detachment, which had persisted in fighting behind enemy lines, helped the farmers find their homes at this time. A female labor model from Nanling Village recalled the situation at the time: "Chiang Kai-shek breached the Yellow River, washing away the roads in this area. The Communist Party came and led us out of new roads from places where there were no roads."
    In October, after the establishment of the Xihua County People's Government, it systematically led the disaster victims in the flood area to rebuild their homes. At that time, there were more than 100,000 disaster victims who had returned from all over the country, and the biggest difficulties were no housing and no food. The Xihua County People's Government and the County Party Committee determined that production and disaster relief were the central tasks. All the cadres went down to the villages, organized the farmers to cut firewood and grass to exchange for grain and sweet potatoes in the non-flood areas; and helped the farmers to dig out the beams and rafters in the silt and build窝棚 shacks. After they had settled down initially, the government organized the farmers to reclaim wasteland while cutting firewood and grass to exchange for grain. Because there were few tools, most of them dug窑 cave dwellings in the silt and planted some grain. In this way, they reclaimed 5,165 acres of wasteland and lent wheat seeds to help the farmers plant wheat in preparation for surviving the famine next spring.
    In the spring of 1948, the People's Government promulgated the policy of "whoever reclaims the land, sows, and harvests," and at the same time abolished private land ownership before the Yellow River flood, and organized the farmers to launch a wasteland reclamation movement. In the past three years, with the government's relief and support, lending grain and seeds, and reclaiming wasteland and production, by this year before the wheat harvest, the wasteland in the Xihua flood area has been completely eliminated. Since then, 1.2 million acres of fertile land that was flooded by Chiang's bandits with Yellow River water has been sown with crops again.
    This summer, the wheat harvest was the first bumper harvest since the reconstruction of the flood area. The 740,000 acres of wheat sown last autumn yielded an average of 80 to 100 jin per mu, and some villages in the fourth and seventh districts even yielded 200 jin per mu. At present, the number of farmers who have returned to settle down in the county has reached 304,000. According to statistics in January this year, more than 130,000 houses that were washed down by the water have been repaired, with an average of one house for every two people. After the wheat harvest, the farmers are building on a large scale. In the past, they built one large small house, but now they are building two or three large houses. Ling Jinzhou, a farmer in Nanling Village, only had 20 mu of land before the Yellow River flood, rented 50 mu of land from the landlord, and fed a donkey and an ox. In addition to paying rent to the landlord every year, what was left was not enough to eat until the next wheat harvest. Now, with the help of the People's Government, he has worked hard to reclaim wasteland and has planted 50 mu of good land, and is feeding an ox and a horse each. After this summer's wheat harvest, he built two new houses, and his life is better than before the Yellow River flood. He promoted everywhere: "Chiang Kai-shek breached the Yellow River, forcing me to flee famine for ten years, with no way out. The Communist Party came and helped me up, giving me a way out. Thinking about it, how can I not thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" Now he is serving as the chairman of the farmers' association in Nanling Village, leading the people of the whole village to move forward on the road to a new life.

　　从黄水泛滥到重建家园的十三年
    记西华泛区人民的顽强斗争

            一
    十三年前，西华县的人民，和黄河两岸的许多县一样，在当地共产党组织的领导下，不顾国民党的反动统治，暗地里进行着各种抗日活动。青年男子纷纷投入共产党员王其梅、路延岭同志领导的抗日游击队中。不上一年时间，这支抗日游击队已扩大到四千人。各村的人民也都先后组织起来，共同喊着：“打倒日本，铲除汉奸！”的口号，准备给进犯的日寇以迎头痛击。
    一九三八年六月，和日寇进犯过了黄河的消息同时，一个奇怪的消息传到西华人民的耳朵里：“蒋介石打不过日本，在花园口把黄河扒开了口，想用黄河水来抗日。”人们还正在议论着，骂着蒋介石不该放黄水淹老百姓。可是只过了两三天，人们就惊叫着“黄水来了！”正在计划割麦的农民向村外一看，滚滚的黄水由北向南汹涌而来，直向着村庄和麦田奔腾。沟渠被黄水流满了，快成熟的大麦小麦被黄水淹没了。霎时间，被地主豪绅们描写为“绿野肥田粮满仓，鸡鸣人稠村连村”的广大平原，便变成了一片汪洋大海！南凌村的地主们怕黄水进了寨，就把寨门封起来，把粮食财物往砖砌的高楼上移，又连夜伐树造船，准备随时向外搬家。穷人们既没有船又都住的是草房，干着急没办法。这村的贫农凌学明上到寨墙上往四围一看，一眼望不着边的黄水越涨越高。他想着：“这可没活了！”参加抗日游击队的凌孟科和领导青年队的凌体民赶快把穷人找到一块说：“没希望了，这季麦是吃不上了，赶快想法造船向外逃荒吧。”于是大家就连夜合伙打船。船刚打好了四只，寨墙就被水冲开了。一时全村哄动起来，人喊马嘶，鸡飞狗叫。米面被黄水冲走了，锅碗被漂在黄水里，草房被水冲塌了。年青人赶快撑起船来。凌体民喊着：“东西是小事，人是大事，只要人能逃出去就不怕饿死。”穷人们一堆堆在黄水里逃命，地主们却在高楼上笑。地主凌作云是南凌村保长，他一贯反对人民闹抗日，这时他在楼上笑着骂：“看你们还红不红！”（“红”即抗日革命的意思。）
    第二年有些地方黄水下去了。在抗日游击队帮助之下，一部分老百姓慢慢回来，在水田里播种些稻子。那年稻子还长的不错，可是刚收了稻，蒋介石又派他的八十一师来围剿。他们恶狠狠地说：“西华人都是坏人，光开水淹，他们还要红，非杀完不可。”于是蒋匪八十一师就到一村杀一村。南凌村一次就被绑了一百多人，在夏亭一次就活埋了十二人。人们所收的稻子及逃荒所带的破衣烂被，也被匪军们抢光了。从此西华人民就在黄水和蒋匪的夹攻下，二次逃出家乡。南凌村共一千二百多人，除地主们留下了二十八个人看家外，全部逃出去了。这时西华全县一百二十万亩良田全变成了芦苇草原；七百多个村庄的房屋也都被冲塌淹没。四十三万人民逃出去，过着饥饿流浪的乞讨生活。好多人还没逃出黄泛区就被饿倒饿死。在泛区的路旁泥潭里，到处躺着尸体。凌秋民一家八口人逃出去，就饿死了六口。南凌村逃出去一千二百多人，现在返回来的，连新添小孩在内，仅剩下九百多人。西华县的抗日人民和整个黄泛区的四百万人民一样，都在蒋贼扒开黄河堤的毒手下，过了十年逃荒流浪饥饿死亡的生活。蒋匪欠下黄泛区人民的这一笔血债是难以统计的！
    日寇投降后，蒋介石匪帮又变了新花样。他为了使西华人民温顺地给美帝国主义当奴隶，组织了几十个所谓“救济”团体。接着来了一堆美国人、英国人，携带着一批美国剩余物资，如可可、巧克力糖、咖啡、香料、鱼肝油及一些女人花衣服、高跟皮鞋等。他们到西华县城住下，说是来“救济”西华泛区人民的。他们在西华干了一些什么呢？第一，找当地的豪绅地主，每天吃肉喝酒，把他们带来的一批拖拉机替地主们开垦荒地；第二，叫难民修汽车路，准备进攻解放区；第三，组织“教养院”，让地主的孩子去上学，听讲“美国人好”，第四，组织“妇女缝纫社”，光收漂亮年青的妇女，供他们享乐；第五，发巧克力糖，女人花衣服、高跟鞋。西华县被“救济”了半年，年青漂亮的姑娘，却被美国人和蒋匪的“救济”官员强奸了不少。城里一位开明士绅也生气地说：“这么‘救济’五年，西华城就会没有人了。”美国人黑牧士，每天拿着糖到街上闲逛，碰到小孩就让小孩先给他敬礼，然后装着笑脸给小孩一块糖吃。有一次一个小孩忘了敬礼，就摸着他的裤腿要糖吃，这位美国牧士就把这个不懂事的孩子痛打了一顿。
            二
    西华县的人民，在黄水泛滥，逃荒流浪的苦难的日子里，也并没有停止过抗日斗争。青年人大部参加了新四军，逃出来的人们也经常和游击队到黄泛区活动。他们经常出现在黄水窝和芦草里，打击从逍遥镇出来抢粮的日寇和伪军。有一次水西游击支队和南凌民兵夺获日寇一大车粮，立即分给逃在外面的人们吃。像这样的事情是很多很多的。
    一九四七年春，黄水下落后，住在周口附近的地主们就赶快回到村中，凭着他们有钱有牲口，又有“行总”的托拉机队，就大量开起荒地来。如南凌村大地主凌作云等回村后，很快就开下十四顷地。当逃在远乡的农民返回来时，地主们说：“你们要种地我可以租给你们；想开荒也有荒”。没吃没住的农民，那有力量来开荒？看了看一片黄水窝又逃走了。
    这年秋天，刘邓大军打过黄河来。逃在四乡的西华人民听到喜讯后，就纷纷往回搬家。被黄水淹了十年的西华地区，地形都变了样，人们回来连自己的村庄也认不得了：草房全被黄泥淤没了，大树也被黄泥埋掉只剩一个树梢在地面上飘动。到处是黄水窝、稀泥沙。从这庄到那庄根本没有路。许多灾民回来，几天找不着自己的村庄。一直坚持敌后战斗的水西游击支队，这时就帮助农民们带路找家乡。南凌村妇女劳动模范回忆当时的情况说：“蒋介石扒黄河，冲的这块地方连路都没有了。共产党来了，才领着俺们从没路的地方走出新路来。”
    十月间，西华县人民政府成立后，就有计划地领导泛区灾民重建家园。当时从各地回来的灾民有十万多人，最大的困难是没房住、没饭吃。西华县人民政府和中共县委会就确定以生产救灾为中心工作。全县干部下到村，组织农民群众割柴草到非泛区去换粮食和红芋；又帮助农民挖出淤泥中的檩梁椽柱，搭成窝棚。初步安下家来了，政府又组织农民一面开荒一面割柴草换粮食。因为工具少，大部是在淤泥中挖窑点种一部分粮食，这样一共开了五千一百六十五亩荒地，又贷下麦种，帮助农民种上麦，准备来年春天度荒。
    一九四八年春天，人民政府又颁布了“谁开谁种，谁种谁收”的开荒政策，并同时取消黄水前的私人土地所有权，组织农民群众展开开荒运动。三年来，经过政府的救济扶植，贷粮贷种，开荒生产，到今年麦前，西华泛区的荒地已全部消灭。从此被蒋匪用黄水淹没的一百二十万亩良田，又全部播种上了庄稼。
    今年夏天，麦子是重建泛区以来的第一次丰收。去秋播种的七十四万亩麦子，平均每亩收到八十至一百斤，四、七区部分村庄每亩还收到二百斤。目前返里安家的农民，全县已达三十万零四千人。被水冲塌的房屋，据今年一月份的统计，已修起十三万余间，平均每二人可住一间房子。麦收后农民群众又大兴土木，过去修的是一间大的小房，现在修的是两间至三间的大房。南凌村农民凌金州，在黄水前自己只有二十亩地，租种地主五十亩地，喂一个驴一个牛，每年除交地主租子外，剩下的还吃不到来年麦口。现在人民政府帮助下努力开荒，已种好地五十亩，喂牛马各一头。今夏麦收后，他又新盖两间房，生活比黄水前还好。他到处宣传说：“蒋介石扒黄河，逼得我逃荒十年，走头无路。共产党来了，才把我扶起来，使我有了出路。思前想后，我怎能不感谢共产党毛主席呢！”现在他担任着南凌村的农会主任，正领导着全乡人民向着新生活的道路前进。
