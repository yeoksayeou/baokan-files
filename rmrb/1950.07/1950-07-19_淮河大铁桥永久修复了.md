　　The Huai River Railway Bridge Permanently Repaired
　　By our reporter Chen Ji

　　The Huai River Railway Bridge officially reopened to traffic on July 11th.

　　I saw stevedores loading local products such as Anhui’s Liu’an tea, Huainan’s coal, and Dabie Mountain’s hemp onto trains. Every day, trains heavily haul these goods, transporting them across the Huai River Bridge to Pukou and Nanjing at a rate of seven to eight hundred tons. I also saw trains from North China, Northwest China, and East China, loaded with goods and crowded with passengers, safely crossing the Huai River Bridge at a speed of thirty kilometers per hour. The surging Huai River, with the arrival of the rainy season, has continuously swelled. The Huai River Bridge, spanning the Huai River, stands securely, ensuring that transportation between the north and south of the Huai River will never be cut off. Last year, on July 1st, the valiant soldiers of the 3rd Detachment of our Railway Engineering Corps, completed the Huai River pontoon bridge ahead of schedule in two months, ensuring that north-south transportation was not interrupted for a year. This July, the workers of our Jinan Railway Bureau permanently repaired the Huai River Bridge in eight months. This not only guarantees the safety of train travel during the rainy season for the long term but also strengthens our confidence in building new large railway bridges in a standardized way for our new China.

　　We Can Build Even Larger Railway Bridges

　　The Huai River Railway Bridge is 574 meters long, constructed with nine under-bearing Warren trusses, making it a famous large bridge on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, second only to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. It was initially completed in 1910, and is now forty years old. In 1938, during the Japanese invasion of the Central Plains, the bridge was damaged. In 1949, the bandit Liu Ruming attempted to prevent our army from crossing the river and completely destroyed the bridge with two train cars full of explosives. After such extensive damage, the Huai River Railway Bridge’s repair project was extremely arduous. However, for the sake of future north-south transportation safety, the Ministry of Railways decided to repair and reopen it to traffic this year and ordered the Jinan Railway Bureau to undertake the task. The workers of the Jinan Bureau not only had to salvage the destroyed steel beams but also had to lay them down as new beams. The three shattered bridge piers had to be cleared one by one before new bridge piers could be built on the riverbed. The Huai River's current is rapid, the water is "bottomless" deep, and it is murky all year round. Moreover, seventy to eighty percent of the bridge-building workers were temporary workers, most of whom lacked experience. Modern bridge-building tools were also lacking, and some materials had to be improvised. Many people lacked confidence in repairing this large bridge before the floods. The boat bosses along the Huai River also said, "In the past, the Japanese devils spent a lot of effort to repair this bridge. Now, to repair it in seven or eight months, I'm afraid it will be difficult, right?" In the end, the railway bridge was finally repaired. After the Jinan Bureau's workers repaired the railway bridge, a technician proudly said, "We will also repair even larger railway bridges than this one."

　　Bombs and Floods Could Not Stop the Work

　　On March 13th, American-made bandit planes came to bomb the Huai River Bridge. Many of the workers working at the construction site did not leave. Worker Zhang Yujun was on the No. 6 bridge pier when he saw an American-made bandit plane's bomb about to fall near the construction site, and he took cover briefly. Gong Zhendong, beside the No. 3 bridge pier, watched the American-made bandit plane fly in, watched it drop a bomb and fly away, and he stayed in place, monitoring the equipment and preventing sabotage by special agents. Worker Wang Huanlun was killed by the bombing. When the workers buried him, everyone vowed: "We are not afraid of bombs, we will work to the end!"

　　At the end of February, during the dry season, the Huai River experienced an unprecedented spring flood, with the river water rising by three meters. In late April, there was a second major flood. The workers fought in the floods, never stopping work. In the cold river water, fourteen meters deep, worker Li Jiquan bravely salvaged the fourth span of the bridge, took off his cotton-padded coat, and went into the water four times in a row. Worker Yu Donghai also went into the water three times. When they came out of the water, their skin was frozen purple, but their hair was steaming. Under the No. 5 bridge pier, the current was too swift, and the stones in the water were tumbling around. A diver's leg was broken by a stone. When the workers heard this news, they continued to fight the floods, fearlessly clearing the bridge piers. Worker Li Yirong worked in the cement water for too long, and his feet were corroded, but he still worked as usual.

　　"Go All Out" and "Do Whatever There Is to Do"

　　The workers of the 16th squad were all local temporary workers. In the upsurge of the "May 1st" competition, they put forward the slogan "Go All Out." They said that they did heavy work and, since they did not understand technology, they had to contribute their strength. When they carried flagstones, squad leader Zhu Zhixiu always walked in the front. He carried a 400-jin flagstone alone and rushed to deliver it. His partner, Chang Guitang, learning from his spirit, actually carried a 500-jin flagstone. The work done by their squad was more than that of three squads, but they were the first to complete it.

　　The mechanical workers of the Fourth Detachment, with the spirit of "Do Whatever There Is to Do," often automatically looked for work. Although the superiors stipulated that those who temporarily had no work to do could rest and still receive their salaries, they helped the coolies carry stone ballast and transport flagstones; when they saw road timbers washed away by the flood, they jumped into the water to retrieve them; they searched everywhere for scrap iron and sometimes even dug out coal cinders from the boiler, recovering usable coal amounting to three to four hundred jin.

　　New Records

　　The workers who repaired the Huai River Bridge repeatedly set new records in the production competition. The riveting team of the 16th squad took the lead, increasing the number of rivets per furnace per day from three or four hundred to seven hundred, which was one or two hundred more than the highest record in the Northeast. Bi Desheng's riveting team was not convinced, secretly prepared tools, allocated manpower, and challenged the 16th squad. As a result, each furnace riveted 1,016 rivets per day, setting a national record. Some people said that they riveted a lot, but perhaps the quality was not good. The technical team heard this feedback and immediately sent people to check. After checking for a long time, they only found one rivet that did not meet the standards. To thoroughly check, the technical team also went to check with the political work team, carefully tapping each rivet, and only found three rivets that did not meet the standards, but the quantity was five more. In the bridge painting project, the painting team overcame the difficulty of not being able to buy fish oil by boiling tung oil, soybean oil, and drying agents into substitute fish oil, saving 40 percent of the cost. Using this substitute fish oil to paint the bridge not only did not reduce the quality, but also allowed each person to paint 80 square meters per day, setting a national record for bridge painting. Workers carrying road timbers could carry sleepers back and forth 58 times a day on the two and a half li pontoon bridge. Some workers could carry three sleepers at a time (each sleeper weighed more than a hundred jin). On the construction site, it was very important to quickly unload flagstones from the train cars when the cars were in short supply. Under the call of the superiors, a team of four people unloaded 30 tons of flagstones in 15 minutes, averaging 1,000 jin of flagstones per person per minute. Their squadron leader could not believe it and stood beside them, watching them unload flagstones, with a watch, and the efficiency was indeed so high.

　　The emergence of these amazing new records was all the result of the workers' conscious and creative labor.

　　Two Major Arduous Projects Completed

　　Salvaging steel beams and clearing bridge piers were the two most difficult projects in the repair of the Huai River Bridge. When salvaging steel beams, the salvaging project of the fourth span of the bridge was the most difficult. The engineers believed: "As long as the fourth span of the bridge is salvaged, there will be no problem with salvaging the steel beams."

　　How to salvage the fourth span of the bridge? The workers came up with the method of "using a bridge to lift a bridge." The already repaired third span of the bridge was moved one bay to the south end, and by using the force of this bay, the fourth span of the bridge was lifted with a pulley. However, during the process of "lifting the beam with a pulley," a large flood suddenly occurred, and the pulley malfunctioned in the water and could no longer lift. Fortunately, workers Wang Yuwu and others voluntarily went into the water 11 times to fight the cold flood, and only then did they straighten the pulley and lift out the fourth span of the bridge. The workers matched the materials on the fourth span of the bridge, which was six or seven zhang high, and completed more than 100 pieces of material in nine days. This method of "matching materials in the air" enabled the engineering of the fourth span of the bridge to be completed quickly.

　　Among the piers, the fifth pier was the most difficult to clear. The fifth pier had been damaged twice. The Japanese repaired it once very carelessly and left a broken steel beam downstream of the pier, which added a lot of trouble to this repair project. Because to build a pier, you must first clear the bad pier before you can start; however, this bad steel beam was lying horizontally downstream, blocking the road for the bad pier to go downstream. Moreover, the water here was 14 meters deep and flowed very fast, so divers could not go down to clear it. At this time, the workers and engineers were very anxious, and after repeated studies, they decided to use this method: the bad piers were tied with steel wires, lifted over the bad steel beam, and the bad piers were washed away by the water. As a result, it took more than a month for the workers to clear the obstacles on the bad pier. Then the workers put the steel caisson into the water, but it could not be lowered to the bottom of the water, and the rapid water flowed into the steel caisson. After repeated repairs and bottom-watering cement, the workers were able to continue clearing the pier in the steel caisson. After three or four months of work, the bad pier was cleared and the fifth pier was built, finally completing one of the arduous projects of the Huai River Railway Bridge. After seeing this project, Soviet expert Giganov said: "If it weren't for your hard work to repair the fifth pier, the Huai River Railway Bridge would not have been able to open to traffic before the flood."

　　The Huai River Railway Bridge has been permanently repaired. What about the entire project? The Soviet bridge expert told me: "The bridge repair workers were able to repair such a large bridge in a short period of time and did a very good job on the most difficult projects in bridge engineering, the work of the fifth pier and the fourth span of the bridge. On each span of the bridge and each pier, we have seen the achievements of the workers and engineers—this is a great achievement." This achievement occupies a glorious page in the history of bridge construction in New China.

　　淮河大铁桥永久修复了
    本报记者  陈迹
    从七月十一日起，淮河大铁桥正式通车了。
    我看见搬运工人正把刚下船的安徽六安茶、淮南矿的煤和大别山的麻等土产物资装上了火车。火车每天以七、八百吨的运输量，沉重地拖着这些物资，通过淮河铁桥，运到浦口和南京去。我又看见从华北、西北和华东开来的火车，装着满满的物资，载着拥挤的旅客，安全地以三十公里的时速驶过淮河铁桥。汹涌的淮水，随着雨季的到来，连续暴涨。横跨在淮河上的淮河铁桥安然屹立着，淮河南北的交通永也不会断绝了。去年“七一”，我们英勇的铁道兵团三支队的战士们，以两个月的时间，提前修好淮河便桥，使得一年来的南北运输没有中断。今年七月，我们济南铁路局的工人们，以八个月的时间，永久修复了淮河铁桥。这不但长期保证了今后雨季行车的安全，而且使我们正规建设新中国大铁桥的信心增强了。
        我们能修好更大的铁桥
    淮河铁桥长达五百七十四公尺，是九孔下承花梁所构成，是津浦线上仅次于黄河铁桥的有名大铁桥。最初修成是在一九一○年，至今已有四十年了。一九三八年日寇进犯中原，该桥曾被破坏。一九四九年刘匪汝明企图阻挡我大军渡江，曾以两节车皮的炸药，将该桥全部炸毁。淮河铁桥经过这样的大破坏，修复工程是极其艰巨的。但为了今后南北交通的安全，铁道部决定在今年修复通车，并命令济南铁路局担任这个任务。济南局的工人不仅要打捞被破坏了的钢梁，而且还要铺好它，当作新梁使用。三座粉碎的桥墩，都要一个个清理，然后才能在水底上建筑起新桥墩。淮河水性急湍，水深“无底”，终年混浊不清。修桥的工人，又百分之七、八十是临时工，大多没有经验。近代的修桥工具也缺乏，有些材料又得临时凑。要在洪水之前，修好这座大桥，很多人是没有信心的。淮河边的轮船老板也说：“过去日本鬼子修这桥，很费气力。现在要在七、八个月内修好，恐怕难成吧？”结果，铁桥终于修复了。在济南局的工人们修好铁桥以后，有个技工骄傲地说：“我们还要修好比这更大的铁桥。”
            炸弹和洪水阻止不了工作
    三月十三日，美制匪机曾经来淮河桥轰炸。在工地工作着的工人们，很多没有离开。工人张玉俊在六号桥墩上，看见美制匪机的炸弹快落近工地了，才隐蔽了一下。巩振东在三号桥墩边，看着美制匪机飞来，又看着它丢了炸弹飞去，他始终没离开原地，监视着器材，防止特务破坏。工人王焕伦被炸死，在工人埋葬他的时候，大家发誓：“我们不怕炸弹，我们工作到底！”
    在二月底枯水时期，淮河竟发生了二十年来从未有过的春季洪水，河水高涨了三公尺。四月下旬，又发生第二次大洪水。工人们在洪水里转战着，从未停止工作。在十四公尺深的寒冷的河水里，工人李继泉奋勇打捞第四孔桥，脱了棉衣，连续下水四次。工人于东海也下水三次。他们出水的时候，皮肤都被冷水冻紫了，头发里却冒着热气。在五号桥墩下，水势太急，水里的石头乱窜，有个潜水工的腿曾被石头撞断。工人们听了这个消息，还继续与洪水搏斗，毫不畏惧地清理桥墩。工人李宜荣在洋灰水里工作过久，脚被蚀烂了，还是照常工作。
            “猛干”和“有啥干啥”
    十六班的小工，都是当地的临时工人，他们在“五一”竞赛的热潮里，提出“猛干”的口号。他们说，他们干的就是重活，不懂技术，就得出力气。他们抬片石的时候，班长朱治修总是走在前头，他一个人扛了四百斤重的片石，还连走带跑地抢先运到。他的伙伴常桂棠学习着他的精神，居然扛上了五百斤重的片石。他们一班人做的活比三班人还多，但都最先完成了。
    四中队的机械工人，抱着“有啥干啥”的精神，常常自动找活做。虽然上级规定：暂时没工做的，可以休息，照样领薪。但是他们却帮助小工抬石碴，运片石；看见道木被洪水冲走了，就一骨碌跳下水去，打捞道木；到处搜集废铁，有时还从锅炉里掏出煤碴，检出可用的煤炭达三、四百斤。
            新的纪录
    修复淮河桥的工人们在生产竞赛中一再创造新纪录。一六班的铆钉组带头，使每盘炉每日铆钉数目从三、四百提高到七百，比东北的最高纪录还要多一两百。毕得胜的铆钉组不服气，偷偷地准备好工具，配备好人力，向一六班挑战，结果每盘炉每日铆钉达一千零一十六个，创造了全国的纪录。有人说，他们铆是铆得多，恐怕质量不会好。技术组听见这个反映，马上派人检查，查了很久，只发现一个铆钉不合规格。为了检查彻底，技术组又会同政工组去检查，仔细地敲了每个铆钉，只发现三个铆钉不合规格，然而数量却多出了五个。油工组在油漆桥梁工程中，用桐油、豆油和干燥剂熬成代用鱼油，克服了买不到鱼油的困难，节省了百分之四十的费用。他们以这种代用鱼油，油漆桥梁，不仅没有降低质量，而且每人每天油好八十平方公尺，创造全国漆梁工程的纪录。扛道木的工人，在两华里半的便桥上，每人每天能扛着枕木来回走五十八趟，有些工人一次能扛三根枕木（每根枕木百多斤）。在工地里，需用车皮太紧，从车上迅速卸下片石，是一件很重要的事情。在上级号召之下，有个组四个人以十五分钟的时间，卸完三十吨片石，平均每人每分钟能卸完一千斤片石。他们的大队长不敢相信，曾经看着表站在他们的旁边，望着他们卸片石，效率果然是这么高。
    这种种惊人的新纪录的出现，都是工人们自觉的创造性劳动的结果。
            两大艰巨工程完成了
    捞钢梁和清理桥墩是淮河桥修复中最困难的两大工程。在打捞钢梁时，以第四孔桥的打捞工程为最艰难，工程师们认为：“只要第四孔桥捞起了，捞钢梁就没有什么问题了。”
    怎样打捞第四孔桥呢？工人们想出“以桥吊桥”的办法。把已修好的第三孔桥向南端移了一间格，借着这个间格的力量，用滑车吊第四孔桥。但在“滑车吊梁”的过程中，忽然发生大水，滑车在水里发生故障，不能再吊。幸而工人王玉武等四人自动下水十一次，与寒冷的洪水作斗争，才把滑车拨顺，把第四孔桥吊了出来。工人们在六、七丈高的第四孔桥上对料，九天当中，对完了一百多件料。这种“空中对料”的方法，使得第四孔桥的工程能够很快完成。
    在清理桥墩中，第五号桥墩最难清理。第五号桥墩曾被破坏过两次，日寇修复了一次，非常马虎，并且在桥墩的下游留下一座破钢梁，给这次修复工程增加了不少麻烦。因为筑桥墩，首先得把坏的桥墩清理出去，才能动手；然而这座坏钢梁横睡在下游，堵住了坏的桥墩往下游出去的道路。并且这里的水深达十四公尺，流得非常急，因此潜水工不能下去清理。这时候，工人们和工程师们很着急，一再研究，决定用这样一个办法，就是：钢丝拴着这些坏桥墩，吊过坏钢梁，使坏桥墩被水冲走。结果，花费了一个多月时间，工人们才把坏桥墩上的障碍清了出去。于是工人们把铁围堰放下水去，但放不到水底，急水又流进铁围堰。经过多次的修补和打水底洋灰，工人们才能在铁围堰里继续清理桥墩。经过三、四个月的功夫，才把坏桥墩清理好，才筑起了第五号桥墩，最后完成淮河铁桥的艰巨工程之一。苏联专家吉贺诺夫看了这个工程，连说：“要不是你们艰苦奋斗修好第五号桥墩，洪水以前淮河铁桥通车是办不到的。”
    淮河铁桥永久修复了，整个工程怎样呢？苏联桥梁专家告诉我说：“修桥工人能在短期内修好这样大的桥，把桥梁工程中最困难的第五号桥墩和第四孔桥的工作，都做得非常好，这是难有的成绩。在每孔桥和每个桥墩上，我们都看见工人们和工程师们的成绩——这是很大的成绩。”这个成绩在新中国桥梁建设史上占据了光辉的一页。
