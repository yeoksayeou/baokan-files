Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 22nd: After joining the New Democratic Youth League, many young workers in Northeast China have received education and training from the League, their class consciousness has been continuously raised, and they have worked actively and been honorably approved to join the Communist Party. According to incomplete statistics from youth league organizations in Northeast China at the end of June, a total of 16,055 young league member workers in Northeast China (excluding Lushun-Dalian and Rehe) have joined the Communist Party, accounting for 2.8 percent of the total number of Communist Party members in Northeast China. In Shenyang City alone, 2,295 young league member workers have joined the Communist Party in the past year, accounting for more than one-sixth of the total number of Communist Party members in the city.

　　东北青年工人团员一万六千人入党
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北不少的青年工人加入了新民主主义青年团后，受到团的教育和锻炼，阶级觉悟不断提高，工作积极，光荣地被批准加入了共产党。据东北各地青年团组织六月底的不完全统计，全东北共有一万六千零五十五名青年工人团员加入了共产党（旅大、热河不包括在内），占东北共产党员总数的百分之二点八。仅沈阳市一年来就有二千二百九十五名青年工人团员加入共产党，占全市共产党员总数的六分之一强。
    各地加入共产党的青年工人团员，绝大多数都是生产积极的分子。如大连电业玻璃工厂从去年十一月以来，在加入共产党的二十名青年团员中，有十九名是生产功臣，一名是全厂的劳动模范。沈阳机器三厂四十三名入党青年团员，都是新纪录创造者。此外，如劳动英雄赵国有等和新涌现的劳动模范赵明月、王泰和、马素琴等，都是青年团员中被吸收入党的优秀分子。
    一年来，东北青年工人团员中已有五千六百八十八名被提拔为共产党、人民政府和工会干部。如松江省鸡西煤矿有一百五十九名青年团员被提升为行政工作中科、股、坑、班级的部干，这些干部占该矿青年团员百分之六点六。佳木斯东北第二纺织厂的女工青年团员孙维良被选为松江省总工会的候补委员。大连铁路工具厂二十一岁的青年团支部书记张来材并被提升为该厂厂长。
