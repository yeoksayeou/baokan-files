Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 13th: The beginning of the recovery of free lending relationships in some rural areas of Hunan Province has helped some poor farmers with production and overcome hard times. Currently, free lending has begun to become active in some areas of more than twenty counties, including Qiyang, Lingling, Dong'an, Daoxian, Yongming, Changsha, Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Pingjiang, Liling, Liuyang, and Lixian. According to a survey in Baoyu Township, District One of Qiyang, free lending has begun in ten of the seventeen villages in the township. In Zhichang Township, Village Two of the county, thirty households lent out a total of 200 *shi* of surplus grain, providing food for 300 poor peasant households.

In the early days of the liberation of Hunan Province, due to harassment by special agents and bandits, the production morale of farmers was generally uneasy. Those with surplus grain were afraid that the People's Government would abolish all debts, and unscrupulous landlords consciously stopped lending, leading to a basic standstill in rural lending. After social order gradually stabilized, local people's governments began to widely publicize the policy of free lending, guaranteeing that loans would be repaid with principal and interest. Some areas also carried out lending through farmers' associations, initially connecting lending relationships. For example, in Zhuzhou District, Xiangtan, Village 26 lent out more than 100 *shi* of rice through the farmers' association. After understanding the government's free lending policy, many people with surplus grain took the initiative to contact the farmers' association or directly lend to others. In Baoyu Township, District One of Qiyang, a wealthy peasant in Village 12 voluntarily took out more than 1,000 *jin* of grain that had been hidden and lent it out. Under her influence, the village lent out more than 10,000 *jin* of grain, enabling more than fifty poor peasant households to survive the summer famine. At the same time, after many wealthy peasants understood the policy of preserving the wealthy peasant economy in the Land Reform Law, they not only improved their enthusiasm for production but were also more at ease in dealing with lending issues. Two wealthy peasant households and one landlord household in Lianyong Township, District Five of Daoxian, voluntarily took out 4,900 *jin* of surplus grain to lend to poor peasants, and many middle peasants also lent their saved surplus grain to poor peasants and hired laborers to help them through the famine.

　　湖南省一部分农村
    自由借贷开始恢复
    帮助了部分贫苦农民生产度荒
    【新华社长沙十三日电】湖南省部分农村自由借贷关系的开始恢复，帮助了部分贫苦农民生产度荒。目前祁阳、零陵、东安、道县、永明、长沙、湘乡、湘潭、平江、醴陵、浏阳、澧县等二十多县的部分地区的自由借贷已开始活跃。据祁阳一区保浯乡的调查，全乡十七个保中已有十个保开始自由借贷。该县至昌乡二保三十户共借出余粮二百石，使三百户贫农得到口粮。
    湖南省解放初期，由于特务和土匪的骚扰，农民生产情绪普遍不安。有余粮的人恐怕人民政府要废除一切债务，加上不法地主有意识地停止借贷，致农村借贷基本停顿。在社会秩序渐趋稳定后，各地人民政府开始广泛宣传自由借贷政策，保证有借有还、有本有利；有些地区并通过农会进行借贷，使借贷关系初步沟通。如湘潭株州区二十六村就由农会经手借出稻谷一百多石。在了解政府自由借贷的政策后，不少有余粮的都主动地到农会接洽或直接借给旁人。祁阳一区保浯乡十二保有一家富农自动起出藏起来的一千多斤谷子出借。在她的影响下，该保共借出一万多斤粮食，使得五十多户贫农度过夏荒。同时，不少富农在明白了土地改革法中保存富农经济的政策以后，不仅提高了生产积极性，在处理借贷问题上也比较安心。道县五区濂勇乡两户富农和一户地主曾主动拿出四千九百斤余粮借给贫农，许多中农也把自己节省的余粮借给贫、雇农度荒。
