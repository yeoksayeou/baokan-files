[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to increase traffic flow on the east-west Chang'an Avenue and avoid traffic congestion during mass gatherings or parades in front of Tiananmen Square, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to construct an asphalt road, 2,475 meters long and 15 meters wide, alongside the existing road between Dongdan and Xisanzuomen (north entrance of Shibei Hutong). The new road will be built in two sections: one east of South Jiaodao, on the north side of the tram tracks, and one west of South Jiaodao, on the south side of the tram tracks. This will straighten the avenue from Dongdan to the north entrance of Shibei Hutong, with the tram running between the two major roads (the new and old roads serving as one-way streets for eastbound and westbound traffic). The construction is being undertaken by the First, Second, and Third Engineering Teams of the Construction Bureau, with approximately 300 workers. Construction commenced on June 29th. During the road construction, the Xisanzuomen, two ornamental arches, and the low flower walls from Tiananmen to Xisanzuomen, which obstruct the project, will be demolished. In addition, "safety islands" for traffic management will be constructed at major intersections such as Dongdan, Wangfujing, and Nanheyan. The entire project is expected to take 60 working days and be completed by mid-September.

　　东单至西三座门动工修筑柏油路
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府为扩大东西长安街的交通量，避免天安门前群众集会或游行时交通拥塞现象，决定在东单至西外三座门（石碑胡同北口）之间配合原有马路另行筑修长二千四百七十五公尺，宽十五公尺的柏油路。新路分两段修筑，一在南夹道以东靠电车道北面，一在南夹道以西靠电车道南面，这样，使东单到石碑胡同北口的大道拉成一条直线，电车走行两条大路之间（新旧路即作为东西行的单行道）。此项工程由建设局第一、第二、第三三个工程队约三百工人负责修筑，已于六月二十九日动工。修路时须拆去有碍工程的东西外三座门、两个牌楼和天安门到西外三座门的矮花墙；并在东单、王府井、南河沿等要路口修筑维护交通用的“安全岛”，全部工程预定用六十个工作日，九月中旬可全部完工。
