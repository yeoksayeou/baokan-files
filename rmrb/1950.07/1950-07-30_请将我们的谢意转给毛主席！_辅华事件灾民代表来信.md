“Please convey our gratitude to Chairman Mao!”
    Letter from Representatives of Disaster Victims of the Fuhua Incident

    To the Editor:
    We are the people affected by the explosion at the Fuhua Firecracker Factory outside Chaoyangmen in Beijing. After this unfortunate event, dozens of people lost their lives, hundreds were injured, and thousands of houses collapsed or were completely destroyed. In the past, this would have left us without food or shelter. But the People's Government vigorously came to our rescue. The dead were properly coffined and buried, the seriously injured were hospitalized, and those with minor injuries were treated at public hospitals. Relief supplies such as clothing, bedding, and utensils, as well as large amounts of donations, were constantly being sent from all sides. The state also provided subsidies and loans to help us rebuild our homes. Affected industrial and commercial households received preferential treatment with temporary tax reductions and exemptions. When the Secretary of the 13th District Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China reported on the aftermath work and Secretary-General Xue of the Municipal Government made a self-criticism, we were deeply moved! We simply cannot repay this kindness. In addition to working hard in production, we also ask the editor to convey the gratitude of our disaster-stricken masses to Chairman Mao.
                Representatives of the Disaster Victims of the Fuhua Incident: Ma Debao, Zhang Baofeng, Li Fu,
                                  Zhang Baoshan, Wang Yuquan Same as above

　　“请将我们的谢意转给毛主席！”
    辅华事件灾民代表来信编辑同志：
    我们是北京朝外辅华火药厂爆炸事件中受灾的人民。这一不幸事件发生后，几十个人丧了命，几百人受了伤和几千间房屋塌倒或全部损毁了。这在过去会使我们没有饭吃，没有房住的。但人民政府却以大力救济了我们。死者都妥善地装棺埋葬，重伤的住了医院，伤轻的由公家医院负责治疗。救济物资如衣被用具、大量的捐款，不断从各方送来。国家又给以补助和贷款，帮助我们修盖了房屋。受灾的工商业户，则受到暂时减免税收的优待。当中共北京十三区区委书记同志向我们报告善后工作和市府薛秘书长向我们作检讨工作时，我们太感动了！我们简直无法报答这种恩情。除了努力生产外，并请编辑同志把我们受灾群众的谢意转达给毛主席。
