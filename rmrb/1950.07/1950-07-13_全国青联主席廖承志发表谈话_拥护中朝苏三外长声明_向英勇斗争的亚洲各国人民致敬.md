　　All-China Youth Federation Chairman Liao Chengzhi Issues Statement
    Supporting the Joint Declaration of the Three Foreign Ministers of China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union
    Saluting the Asian People Engaged in Heroic Struggle
    [Our Dispatch] Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, issued a statement supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai’s statement. Addressing Truman's arrogant declaration and the armed aggression of American imperialism, the statement pointed out: "This provocative behavior by American imperialism towards all the people of Asia has completely exposed its true face of deliberately undermining peace in the Far East and engaging in imperialist plunder. Regarding this unscrupulous act of aggression by the U.S. government, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, North Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-young, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko have successively issued solemn statements denouncing it. The Chinese youth express their warm support for these three statements. We believe that the UN Security Council should immediately order the United States to withdraw all its land, sea, and air forces from Korea, cease its armed intervention in Korea, and withdraw the Seventh Fleet from Chinese territorial waters, ceasing its armed intervention in Taiwan."
    The statement concluded: "We Chinese youth express our utmost respect for the Korean people who are also suffering from American imperialist aggression and are engaged in a heroic struggle of resistance. We express our respect for the people of Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, and other Asian countries who are struggling against imperialism. We believe that as long as the oppressed nations and people of the East unite as one and resolutely launch a struggle, they will certainly be able to repel the aggression of the United States and any imperialism, and will be able to establish freedom and peace in the Far East! Long live the liberation struggle of the Korean people and all oppressed people of Asia!"

　　全国青联主席廖承志发表谈话
    拥护中朝苏三外长声明
    向英勇斗争的亚洲各国人民致敬
    【本报讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志发表谈话拥护周外长的声明。针对杜鲁门的狂妄声明和美帝的武装侵略，谈话中指出：“美国帝国主义这种公开向全亚洲人民的挑衅行为彻底暴露了它蓄意破坏远东和平进行帝国主义掠夺的真面目。对于美国政府这种肆无忌惮的侵略行为，我国周恩来外长，朝鲜朴宪永外长和苏联葛罗米柯副外长，已经先后发表严正声明，加以痛斥，中国青年对于这三个声明表示热烈的拥护。我们认为：联合国安理会应当立即命令美国将全部陆海空军撤出朝鲜，停止对朝鲜的武装干涉，并将第七舰队撤出中国领海，停止对台湾的武装干涉。”
    谈话最后说：“我们中国青年对于同受美帝侵略并正在进行英勇反抗斗争的朝鲜人民表示最大的敬意。我们对越南、菲律宾、日本和亚洲其他为反对帝国主义而斗争的人民表示敬意。我们相信只要东方各被压迫民族和人民万众一心，坚决地展开斗争，就一定能够击退美国和任何帝国主义的侵略，能够建立远东的自由与和平！朝鲜人民和全亚洲被压迫人民的解放斗争万岁！”
