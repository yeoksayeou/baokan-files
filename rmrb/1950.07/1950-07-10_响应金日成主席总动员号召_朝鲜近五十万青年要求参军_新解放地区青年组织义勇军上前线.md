　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: Since Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, called on the entire nation for general mobilization to participate in the national liberation war to defend the fatherland, patriotic youths have been vying to go to the front lines to kill the enemy. From June 26th to July 6th, over 480,000 youths throughout Korea have requested to join the army, including over 30,000 young women. Youths in the newly liberated areas have successively organized volunteer armies. As of July 4th, over 1,000 students from various universities and specialized schools in Seoul had joined the volunteer army. On the 5th, over 500 female students also signed up. Many bank employees and shop clerks in Seoul have also signed up for the army.
    Over one hundred youths from Mapo District, Seoul, organized a battlefield service corps and went to the front lines, participating in the work of rescuing the wounded in the battle of Noryangjin in Yeongdeungpo District. In the battle where the People's Army captured Gimpo Airport, they assisted the soldiers in transporting ammunition in areas 100 meters from the front lines. Yoon Il-ran, a student at Sookmyung Girls' High School in Seoul, said when signing up for the army: "Under the rule of the enemy, we students felt like we were living in a nightmare. We can no longer endure the enslaving education. We want to organize a volunteer rescue team to go to the front lines and help the People's Army wipe out the enemy." The youths in Incheon Port and Suwon City, which were liberated on July 4th, witnessed the atrocities of the Syngman Rhee bandits and volunteered to join the army on the day of liberation.

    新解放地区青年组织义勇军上前线
    【新华社平壤九日电】自朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成号召全国人民总动员，参加保卫祖国的民族解放战争以来，爱国的青年们纷纷要求上前线杀敌。从六月二十六日至七月六日，全朝鲜青年要求参军的已达四十八万余名，其中有青年妇女三万余名。新解放区的青年相继组织了义勇军。截至七月四日，汉城市内各大学与专门学校的学生参加义勇军的已有千余名。五日，又有女学生五百余名报名参加。汉城各银行职员与商店店员，亦有多人报名参军。
    汉城麻浦区一百余名青年组织了战地服务团开赴前线，在永登浦区鹭梁津战斗中参加了救护伤兵的工作。在人民军攻占金浦机场的战斗中，他们在离前线一百公尺的地带，协助战士们搬运军火。汉城淑明中学学生尹一兰在报名参军的时候说：“在敌人的统治下，我们学生好像生活在恶梦中。我们决不能再忍受奴化教育了，我们要组织义勇救护队到前线去，帮助人民军扫荡敌人。”七月四日解放的仁川港和水原市的青年们，因为他们目睹李承晚匪徒们的暴行，在解放的当天即自告奋勇地报名参军。
