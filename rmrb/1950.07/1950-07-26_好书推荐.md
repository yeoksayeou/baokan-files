　　Good Book Recommendations

　　"Virgin Soil Upturned" Educated Me
　　Translated by Lipo, Published by Sanlian Bookstore
　　Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned" is one of the best books I have ever read.

　　I first read this book in 1942-1944. Last autumn and winter, I had the opportunity to do mass work in the countryside for four months. Although the environment depicted in this book is thousands of miles away from where I am now, and the time is also twenty years apart, this book still educated me. As a true record of the revolutionary struggle among the masses in the countryside during the early days of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it has more meaning and power in guiding my ideological understanding and work style than reading many volumes of rigid dogmatic books and periodicals.

　　"Virgin Soil Upturned" made me realize the importance of the Party's policies. Secondly, the vivid portrayal of typical figures from all strata in the book helped me to understand how to observe people and handle problems using the method of class analysis. In my work, I did not commit the error of narrow mass viewpoint. I firmly grasped the policy principle of "consolidating the alliance with the middle peasants," which I understood from the typical character of Kondrat Maidanikov in the book. Furthermore, my high degree of vigilance against the enemy's rumors, sabotage, and "restoration" conspiracies was largely inspired by the book's cruel and bloody examples. I was able to avoid major mistakes of bureaucracy and commandism in my work (and was able to immediately examine and correct them after making them) because the vivid facts of the district party committee that was only satisfied with issuing instructions and statistics, and the village branch secretary who suffered from impatience and even beat the basic masses, provided me with lessons. In the task of autumn grain collection, the method of collecting grain seeds by the young Communist Youth League member with a face full of freckles in the book helped me persuade a poor peasant to take the lead in paying grain and creating a model figure. I think this literary book is particularly helpful for rural work cadres today.

　　What I want to say more is that this book not only guided me in practical work, but also in theoretical study—for example, when reading certain chapters of "Problems of Leninism" and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," I was also able to connect the theories in those books to the actual situation reflected in this book, and gain a more thorough understanding.

　　The People Who Built Stalingrad
　　Translated by Xia Na and He Jiahua, Published by Sanlian Bookstore
　　Recently, I re-read this book, and the more I read it, the more I found it to be an extremely interesting and valuable book. It contains the self-accounts of the founders of the famous Stalingrad Tractor Factory, a total of fourteen articles. The people who wrote these self-accounts include the general manager, the party committee secretary, the workshop director, the foreman, the shock brigade leader, the ordinary craftsman, and also foreign technicians; there are old Bolsheviks who had made contributions during the civil war, young girls from the countryside who had just stepped into the factory, and also genuine Russian "locals." These various people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), developed into excellent workers loyal to the cause of socialist construction. This book vividly depicts the great scene of the Soviet people enthusiastically engaging in construction during the first Five-Year Plan period.

　　The greatest characteristic of this book is that the authors of each article frankly narrated their personal experiences explored in the process of growth. These experiences are recorded so specifically and so profoundly that it feels like being there. These experiences show that Soviet workers inevitably made many mistakes in their work when they first started learning to manage modern large enterprises. But now they have crossed this stage and have become experts who can competently shoulder the responsibility of construction. Thinking of ourselves, we are currently learning to manage modern enterprises, and naturally, we will inevitably make mistakes like the Soviets did at that time. But reading this book will generate a confidence: we will definitely learn the ability to manage the economy and modern enterprises well.

　　In addition to the above, this book also shows the struggle experiences of the working people. They lived truly unimaginably tragic and difficult lives in the years before and after the revolution. However, the socialist system finally brought them happiness. Their efforts were rewarded, their careers unfolded with unlimited prospects, and today their lives are already very comfortable and pleasant. Reading these self-accounts, anyone will feel excited, yearn, and inspire the enthusiasm to study hard and build their own country hard. Therefore, I hope that everyone, especially the comrades who are workers in factories, can read this book carefully.

　　Because the content of this book involves many technical issues, I have one more request for the translation. The translation of this aspect in the book is not accurate and popular enough. I request the translator, Mr. He Jiahua, to revise or re-translate this when the book is re-published.

　　(Editor's note: This book was used as a study book by some students in this year's graduating class at Tsinghua University.)

　　Experiences in Political Mobilization in Enterprises
　　By Qu Zhimin, K. Kremneva, translated by Shu Lin, Published by Xinhua Bookstore
　　Recently, Xinhua Bookstore published "Experiences in Political Mobilization in Enterprises," one of the "Soviet Propaganda Mobilization Series." This is a most timely book, and every revolutionary worker, especially those working in enterprise departments, must read it.

　　This book tells us how advanced Soviet mobilization groups and mobilization workers used their political work to help complete the great task of restoring and continuing to develop the Soviet national economy.

　　In the past, although the propaganda work in our factories achieved some success, it also had some shortcomings that urgently need to be improved. For example, each factory routinely puts out blackboards, wall newspapers, and mimeographed newspapers, without studying the effect. Some working comrades are also depressed all day long because their talks to workers are always the same old thing, and the workers are unwilling to listen. This is because the political awareness and cultural level of the working class are constantly rising. If we only limit ourselves to the themes of "workers are masters, work hard to produce" and "the factory belongs to the workers themselves" to talk to the workers every day, it is obviously no longer able to meet the workers' requirements. We must be clear on one point in our understanding: that propaganda mobilization must serve production, go deep into the production interior, closely study and combine with each link of the production movement, put forward different vivid and concrete slogans and appeals according to different production situations, and seek diversity in form.

　　In the Soviet Union, the main content of propaganda mobilization work is to cultivate the patriotism of the Soviet people, to educate the working people with Soviet patriotism and Soviet national pride, and to use all methods to arouse the heroic labor creation enthusiasm of the masses, because it is unimaginable to win the victory of production and construction without the enthusiasm of the working people. It is necessary to explain to the workers the significance of the political tasks of Stalin's Five-Year Plan at all times, organize competitions to exceed the completion of quotas, widely promote the experience of advanced workers, and promote advanced labor methods. Mobilization workers do not only talk about narrowly defined production tasks, they also talk about the superiority of the socialist economy over capitalist countries, and educate workers with a communist sense of responsibility. Organizing the saving of national wealth, adopting new technologies, and rationalizing production are all effective means for struggling for over-plan accumulation. In the book "Experiences in Political Mobilization in Enterprises," there are clear and specific suggestions on all of the above aspects.

　　Experience Talks of Workshop Directors
　　Translated by Wang Zhonglan, Ma Hongqi, etc., Published by the Northeast Industrial Department
　　This book contains the experiences of six workshop directors from Moscow and Leningrad, and describes in detail how they organized collective Stakhanovite work. The Stakhanovite movement has played a great role in breaking through old quotas and creating new records since 1935. However, as workshop director Osnas said: "Individual new records cannot complete the plan. It would be different if every worker had the achievements of a Stakhanovite worker." The collective Stakhanovite movement is to make everyone a Stakhanovite worker. The development of this movement has had a great impact on completing Stalin's post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule.

　　Workshop directors are so-called middle and lower-level production leaders. Stalin once mentioned them like this: "There are tens of thousands of these middle and lower-level leaders in our country. They are humble and simple, and they don't show off. They are hardly noticed. But only the blind can't see them. Because the fate of the entire national economy rests on these people; that is to say, the fate of our economic guidance depends on them." Therefore, whether the workshop director can effectively lead production and complete the country's production plan will directly affect the construction prospects of the entire country. The workshop directors introduced in this book recognized the importance of their work, and worked "humbly and simply," and finally became excellent leaders who completed the production tasks ahead of schedule. This high degree of responsibility to the country and the people, and the down-to-earth work style, is worthy of learning by the workshop directors of our country.

　　I hope that every comrade in the industrial sector will carefully read this book, absorb advanced experience, and improve our factory and mine work a step further!

　　How to Learn Culture
　　By Huang Wei, Printed by Tianjin Reader Bookstore
　　This book is aimed at workers and solves some basic problems they encounter in learning. The book has twelve lessons, and the content includes literacy, writing, reading, discussion, and holding group meetings, etc.

　　At present, the main difficulty for workers in learning culture is the problem of how to write. Workers like to write very much, but they don't know how to learn to write, and they don't know what to write. Seven of the twelve lessons in this book talk about these issues, telling workers: write as you speak; write what you do; how to write a diary; how to write meeting minutes; how to take notes.

　　This book also talks about how to speak at discussion meetings, to be able to say what is in your heart, and how to hold group meetings well.

　　This book is not only suitable for employees with a high school education who are learning culture, but can also be used as a reference for workers' education workers.

　　好书推荐
    《被开垦的处女地》教育了我
    立波译  三联书店版
    萧洛霍夫著的《被开垦的处女地》是我读过的一本好书。
    最初读这本书的时候，还在一九四二——四四年。去年秋冬，我有机会到农村去做了四个月群众工作，虽然本书所描绘的与我当前身处的环境相距  万里，时间也隔了二十年，可是这本书还是教育了我。它，作为苏联十月革命初期农村群众中革命斗争的实录，在思想认识上和工作作风上，对我的指导作用，比较读许多册生硬的教条式的书刊，更有意义，更有力量。
    《被开垦的处女地》使我认识了党的政策的重要性。其次，书中对各阶层典型人物的生动描写，帮助我领会到用阶级分析的方法去观察人物、处理问题。在工作中，我没有犯狭隘的群众观点，我紧紧地掌握了“巩固地团结中农”这一政策原则，这是从书中康德脱·梅谭尼可夫这一典型人物那里体会到的。再如对敌人的造谣破坏及“复辟”阴谋的高度警惕性，大半是受了书中残酷的血淋淋的事例的启示。我在工作中能够少犯官僚主义和命令主义的重大错误（犯了之后，也能立即检讨、纠正），是由于书中那个只满足于发布指示和统计的区党委，和犯了急性病甚至殴打基本群众的村支书的鲜明事实，使我有所借鉴。在执行秋征任务中，书中那位一脸乌雀斑的青年团员征收谷物种子的工作方法，帮助我说服了一个贫农带头缴粮，创造了模范人物。我以为这一本文艺书对于今日的农村工作干部，是特别有帮助的。
    还要说到的，本书不但在工作实践上指导了我，而且在理论学习上——例如在阅读《列宁主义问题》和《联共（布）党史简明教程》某些篇章的时候，我也能把那些书上的理论，联系到这一本书中所反映的实际，而获得更加透彻的了解。
    建设斯大林格勒的人们
    夏讷 何家槐译  三联书店版
    最近我重读了这本书，越读就越觉得这是一本极有趣味、极有价值的书。里面刊载着著名的斯大林格勒拖拉机厂的开创者们的自述，一共有十四篇。作这些自述的人，有总经理，有党委书记，有车间主任，有领班，有突击队长，有普通工匠，也有外籍技师；有在内战期间立过功的老布尔什维克，有初次踏进工厂的乡下姑娘，也有道地的俄国“土佬”。这些形形色色的人们，都在联共（布）党的领导之下，发展成为忠心于社会主义建设事业的优秀工作者。这本书极其生动地描绘了在第一个五年计划期间，苏联人民热烈从事建设的伟大场面。
    这本书的最大特点是在于：各篇的作者都直率地叙述了自己在成长过程中摸索出来的切身经验。这些经验被记述得这样具体，这样深刻，使人读起来宛如身历其境。这些经验说明了：苏联的职工，在刚刚开始学习管理现代化的大企业时，不可免地在工作中发生过许多错误。而现在他们已经跨过了这一阶段，变成能够胜任愉快地担负建设责任的内行了。联想到我们自己，目前正在学习管理现代企业，自然也虽免像苏联人当时那样会犯错误。但读了这一本书，就会产生一种信心：我们一定能学好管理经济与现代化的企业的本领的。
    除上述者以外，这本书也表明了劳动人民的奋斗经历。他们在革命前和革命后的若干岁月里，过的真是不可想像的悲惨、艰苦生活。然而，社会主义的制度终于给他们带来了幸福。他们的努力得到了应得的报酬，他们的事业展开了无限的前途，今天他们的生活已经过得很舒适愉快了。读这些自述，任何人都会感到兴奋，响往，激起努力学习，努力建设自己的国家的热情的。因此我希望每个人，特别是工厂里的职工同志，能够把本书仔细读一下。
    因为本书的内容涉及技术问题很多，因此，我对译文还有一个要求。书中关于这一方面，译得不够准确和通俗。我要求译者何家槐先生在该书再版时能够加以修正或改译。
    （编者按：这一本书，清华大学本年毕业班一部分同学曾把它作为学习书籍读的。）
    企业政治鼓励经验
    曲志敏  克列木涅瓦著  舒林译  新华书店版
    最近，新华书店出版了“苏联宣传鼓动丛书”之一的《企业政治鼓动经验》，这是一本最合时宜的书，每一个革命工作者，尤其是在企业部门中工作的同志们必须一读。
    这本书告诉我们苏联先进的鼓动团体和鼓动工作者怎样以自己的政治工作，帮助完成恢复和继续发展苏联国民经济事业的巨大任务。
    过去我们工厂中的宣传工作虽然获得了若干成绩，但同时也存在着若干急须改进的缺点。如各厂照例的出黑板报、墙报、油印报等，而不研究效果如何。也有些工作同志整天苦闷着对工人谈话时老一套，工人不愿听。这因为工人阶级的政治觉悟和文化水平在不断上升，我们若天天仅局限于“工人当主人，努力生产”“工厂是工人自己的”为题材，向工人进行谈话，显然已经不能满足工人的要求了。我们在认识上必须明确一点：即宣传鼓动要为生产服务，深入生产内部，密切研究和结合生产运动的每个环节，针对生产不同情况，提出不同的生动具体口号和号召，并求形式的多样性。
    在苏联，宣传鼓动工作的主要内容是培养苏维埃人民的爱国主义，以苏维埃爱国主义和苏维埃民族骄傲感教育劳动人民，用一切方法激起群众的英雄主义的劳动创造热情，因为争取生产建设的胜利，离开了劳动人民的积极性是不能想像的。要时时刻刻地向工人解释斯大林五年计划的政治任务的意义，组织为超过完成定额的竞赛，广泛宣传先进工作者的经验，宣传先进的劳动方法。鼓动工作者所谈论的不仅仅是狭义的生产任务，他们还讲述社会主义经济对于资本主义国家的优势，教育工人以共产主义的责任心。组织节约国家财富，采用新技术，生产合理化，这都是为超计划积累而斗争的有效手段。在《企业政治鼓动经验》一书里，对上述种种方面，都有着鲜明而具体的提示。
    车间主任经验谈
    王种蓝  马宏祺等译  东北工业部出版
    本书中包含了莫斯科和列宁格勒六个车间主任的经验，详细地叙述了他们如何组织集体斯达哈诺夫工作的经过。斯达哈诺夫运动从一九三五年以来，在突破旧定额创造新纪录方面起了极大的作用。可是，正如车间主任俄斯那斯所说的那样：“个别的新纪录是不能完成计划的，如果全体工人中每一个人都有斯达哈诺夫工作者的成绩，那就不同了。”集体斯达哈诺夫运动就是要使每一个人都成为斯达哈诺夫工作者。这个运动的展开，对提前完成斯大林战后五年计划有很大的影响。
    车间主任是所谓中下级的生产领导者。斯大林曾这样的提到过他们：“这些中下级的领导者，在我们这里有好几万。他们谦虚诚朴，不出风头，几乎不为人所注意。但是也只有瞎子才看不见他们。因为整个国民经济的命运寄托在这些人的身上；也就是说，我们经济指导的命运是有赖于他们的。”因此车间主任之能否有效地领导生产，完成国家的生产计划，将直接影响到整个国家的建设前途。本书中所介绍的车间主任们就是认识了自己工作的重要性，而“谦虚诚朴”地工作着，终于成为提前完成生产任务的优秀领导者。这种高度对国家人民负责，脚踏实地的工作作风，是值得我们国家的车间主任们学习的。
    希望在工业部门的每一个同志都仔细地读一读这本书，吸取先进的经验，把我们的厂矿工作更提高一步！
    怎样学习文化
    黄炜  天津读者书店印行
    本书以工人为对象，解决了他们在学习中所遇到的一些基本问题，全书有十二课，内容包括识字、写作、阅读、讨论，和开小组会等等。
    目前工人学习文化的主要困难的问题是怎样写作的问题。工人们很喜欢写作，但不知道应该怎样去学习写作，不知道该写些什么。本书十二课课文中，有七课谈到这些问题，告诉工人们：话怎样说就怎样写；做什么写什么；怎样写日记；怎样写会议纪录；怎样记笔记。
    本书也谈到怎样在讨论会上发言，把心里的话在嘴上说得出，以及怎样把小组会开好等问题。
    本书不但适合正在学习文化的高小程度的职工们阅读，也可以供工人教育工作者参考。
