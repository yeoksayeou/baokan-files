　　East China's Spring Repair Project Basically Completed
    Flood Prevention This Year Has Strong Guarantee
    Flood Prevention Headquarters Established, Specific Flood Prevention Tasks Determined
    [Report from this newspaper] The spring repair project in East China this year has been basically completed. The safety of major rivers during the flood season has been strongly guaranteed.
    The scale of the water conservancy spring repair project held in East China this spring is huge, stretching from north of the Yellow River (excluding the Yellow River project) to south of the Puyang River in Zhejiang, with a total length of thousands of miles. More than 2.9 million migrant workers directly participated in the water conservancy construction project, and another 300,000 people indirectly served the project. From the winter repairs in December last year to the end of May this year, after more than five months of hard work by engineering and technical cadres and the vast number of migrant workers, except for some Huai River projects and Zhejiang seawall projects that need to be extended to July, other projects have been completed on schedule one after another. A total of more than 190 million cubic meters of earthwork has been completed, accounting for about two-thirds of the total number of water conservancy spring repairs in the country this year, exceeding the highest number of earthwork completed nationwide during the Kuomintang rule in 1931 by 70 percent. If it is built into a long dike with a height and width of one meter each, it can circle the winding coastline of North and South America (64,600 kilometers long) three times. Among them, the most important project is the nationally renowned first phase of the Xin Yi River project, with a total length of 400 kilometers of dikes on both sides, which is farther than Shanghai to Nanjing. Secondly, the Nanjing River dike, inner dike, and embankment dike project completed more than 1.3 million cubic meters of earthwork, although it only accounts for 0.7 percent of the total project in East China this year, it has exceeded twice the total water conservancy project done in the same area during the twenty years of the Kuomintang period. In addition, the Yangtze River restoration and blockage project, the Yangtze River inland river project, the Huai River tributary project, the northern Jiangsu cotton reclamation area project, the Shandong Daoshu project and flood control project, and the Xiu Hui Canal irrigation project were completed. In southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Nanjing and other places, 2,374 culverts and sluices and 43 bridges were completed. The masses in Zhejiang also independently built more than 7,000 small-scale water conservancy projects.
    The East China region is the estuary of major rivers such as the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Yellow River. Due to the past Kuomintang's creation of the Yellow River Garden Mouth breach, river and lake siltation, chaotic water systems, and the Kuomintang's corrupt rule, water conservancy has been neglected for a long time. In recent years, floods have been a disaster every year, and the affected area has become wider and wider. Last year, the affected farmland reached 54 million mu, the affected population was more than 16 million, and the loss of agricultural products was more than 7.7 billion jin. This was the largest disaster for the people of East China since 1931. Therefore, East China has become a key point for national flood control.
    The completion of this year's spring repair project can ensure that 23,885,000 mu of the 54 million mu of farmland flooded last year will no longer be affected by floods, and increase the benefited farmland by 9,325,230 mu. If the average yield per mu is increased by 66 jin of raw grain, and the benefited land is increased by 15 jin of raw grain per mu, the annual output of raw grain can be increased by more than 1.57 billion jin.
    During this year's spring repair project, the region correctly implemented the policy of using work as relief. A total of 5,855,000 disaster victims in the region relied on it to survive the severe spring famine. The number of those who directly transported materials and grass is not included in this number. Therefore, it greatly promoted disaster relief work, stabilized social order, and strengthened the ties between the government and the people.
    In order to strengthen and unify the leadership of the flood prevention work in the region this summer, the Water Conservancy Department of the East China Military and Political Committee held the East China Spring Repair Summary and Flood Prevention Deployment Meeting from June 22 to 29. At the meeting, the East China Flood Prevention Headquarters was formally established. Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, served as the director, and Leng Yu, Minister of the Water Conservancy Department, and Zhou Junming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, served as deputy directors. The meeting also stipulated the specific flood prevention tasks for each province and region this year based on the different conditions of various places and rivers and the achievements of the spring repair project. Shandong Province will focus on the Yellow River, combined with other flood prevention and drainage work, to ensure that the 6.2 million mu of land affected by disasters last year will not be flooded this year. Northern Jiangsu District will focus on the Xin Yi River and Li Yun River to ensure that the 3 million mu of land in the disaster-stricken area on both sides of the Xin Yi River will not be flooded this year. When the Li Yun River does not exceed the water level of 1931, it will ensure that the 2.5 million mu of land affected by disasters last year will not be flooded this year, and increase the benefited land in the reclamation area by 1 million mu. At the same time, the meeting required the Northern Jiangsu District to ensure that when the water level of the Yangtze River main and tributary dikes in the district reaches the highest flood level in 1949, the dikes will not collapse and ensure that the 400,000 mu of land along the river will not be flooded. Northern Anhui District ensures that the Jiangdi and Huaidi dikes will not collapse. The meeting required the organization of drainage work in inland rivers so that 3 million mu of the 10.94 million mu of land affected by disasters last year will have one wheat and one water harvest, and 3 million mu will have two harvests in spring and autumn. Southern Anhui District will strive to prevent the 370,000 mu of land along the river that was flooded last year from being flooded, and ensure the safety of 1.7 million mu of farmland near the inland river embankments. Southern Jiangsu District will ensure that 2.65 million mu of land along the Jiangdi Dike, Gangdi Dike, and Taihu Embankment Dike will not be flooded. Zhejiang Province will focus on seawalls, ensuring that when there are no typhoons larger than last year, the Qiantang River seawall will guarantee that 950,000 mu of land will not be flooded.
    Most of the water conservancy projects in the region this year are newly built, repaired, and rushed to repair, and there are still many shortcomings. All localities should be vigilant, mobilize the masses to step up the protection of river dikes, and ensure that this year's projects can withstand the test of floods.

　　华东春修工程基本结束
    今年防汛已获有力保证
    防汛总指挥部成立·确定具体防汛任务
    【本报讯】华东区今年春修工程已经基本上完成。汛期中各主要河流的安全已获得有力保证。
    华东区今春所举办的水利春修工程，规模巨大，北起黄河以北（黄河工程不在内），南至浙江浦阳江以南，长度共达数千里。直接参加水利修建工程的民工达二百九十余万，间接为工程服务的还有三十万人。从去年十二月的冬修起，到今年五月底止，经工科工作干部和广大民工五个多月的努力修建，现除部分淮河工程及浙江海塘工程须延至七月完成外，其他各项工程均已先后按时完工。共完成土方一亿九千余万公方，约占全国今年水利春修总数的三分之二，超过一九三一年国民党统治时期在全国范围内完成的最高土方数的百分之七十。假如把它筑成高宽各一公尺的长堤，可绕南北美洲曲折的海岸线（长六万四千六百公里）三周。其中最主要的工程，是全国闻名的新沂河第一期工程，两岸长堤共四百公里，比上海到南京还远。其次如南京江堤、内堤、圩堤工程共完成一百三十余万土方，虽然仅占今年华东总工程的百分之零点七，但它已超过国民党时期二十年间在同一地区所做的水利总工程的二倍。此外完成了长江复堤堵口工程、长江内河工程、淮河支流工程、苏北棉垦区工程、山东导沭工程及防洪工程、绣惠渠灌溉工程等。并在皖南、浙江、南京等地完成了涵闸二千三百七十四座，桥梁四十三座。浙江群众并自行兴办了小型水利七千余处。
    华东地区为江、淮、黄河诸大河流的入海处。由于过去国民党制造黄河花园口决口，河湖淤塞，水系混乱，再加上国民党的腐败统治，水利长久失修，近年来洪水年年为患，受害面积越来越广，去年受灾农田即达五千四百万亩，受灾人口一千六百余万，损失农产品七十七亿余斤。这是一九三一年以后，华东人民最大的一次灾害。所以华东成了全国防洪的一个重点。
    今年春修工程的完成，可确保去年受淹的五千四百万亩农田中的二千三百八十八万五千亩不再受水灾，并增加受益农田九百三十二万五千二百三十亩。如以每亩平均增产原粮六十六斤计，受益田以每亩增产十五斤原粮计，每年可增产原粮十五亿七千余万斤。
    在今年春修工程进行中，该区正确执行了以工代赈的政策，全区共有五百八十五万五千灾民赖以度过了严重的春荒。直接运料运草者还不在此数内。因此大大推进了救灾工作，稳定了社会秩序，密切了政府与人民的联系。
    为了加强和统一领导全区今夏的防汛工作，华东军政委员会水利部曾于六月二十二日至二十九日举行华东总结春修部署防汛会议，会上并正式成立了华东防汛总指挥部，由华东军政委员会曾山副主席兼任主任，水利部部长冷遹及人民解放军华东军区副参谋长周骏鸣任副主任。会议并根据各地、各河道的不同情况和春修工程的成就，规定各省、区今年的具体防汛任务。山东省以黄河为重点，结合其他防汛排水工作，保证去年受灾的六百二十万亩地今年不受水淹。苏北区以新沂河、里运河为重点，保证新沂河两岸去年受灾地区三百万亩地今年不受水灾。里运河在不超过一九三一年水位时，保证去年受灾的二百五十万亩地在今年不受水灾，并增加垦区受益田一百万亩。同时，会议要求苏北区保证今年该区长江干支堤的水位达到一九四九年最高洪水位时，堤岸不生溃决，保证沿江的四十万亩地不受水灾。皖北区保证江堤、淮堤不溃决。会议要求组织内地河流的排水工作，使去年受灾的一千零九十四万亩地中，有三百万亩地一麦一水，三百万亩地春秋两收。皖南区争取去年沿江被淹的三十七万亩地不受水灾，并确保内河圩堤附近一百七十万亩农田的安全。苏南区保证沿江堤、港堤和太湖圩堤一带的二百六十五万亩地不受水灾。浙江省以海塘为重点，确保钱塘江海塘在不发生比去年更大的台风时，保证九十五万亩地不受水淹。
    该区今年的水利工程大多是新修、补修和抢修的，还存在着很多缺点。各地应提高警惕，发动群众加紧进行河堤的防护工作，确保今年的工程经得起洪水的考验。
