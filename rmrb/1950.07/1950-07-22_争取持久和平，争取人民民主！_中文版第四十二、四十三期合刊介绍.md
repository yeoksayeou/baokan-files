Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: The combined issue No. 42 and 43 (overall No. 81 and 82) of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" (Chinese Edition) has been published.

The editorial of issue No. 42 is entitled "Strengthening the State System of People's Democratic Countries." The editorial points out: The people's democratic regimes in Central and Southeast European countries, headed by the working class, which have already defeated the bourgeoisie and landlords, are now carrying out the tasks of the proletarian dictatorship and are one of the forms of the proletarian dictatorship. The editorial says: The main factors in the strength and durability of the people's democratic regime are its inseparable ties with the broad masses of working people. The strength of the people's democratic regime lies in: developing and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, continuously improving the activities of the Communist and Workers' Parties and enhancing their leading position, and forming fraternal alliances among the people's democratic countries and between them and their great friend, the Soviet Union. The article states: Consolidating the people's democratic regime requires further improvement of the state apparatus, filling it with proletarian elements, filling it with new cadres loyal to the people, increasing its revolutionary vigilance, and enacting new socialist legislation. The broad masses must be further involved in active state life, actively participating in government agencies and state construction work; an irreconcilable struggle against bureaucracy and against those who hold an indifferent attitude towards the needs of the working people must be launched in all departments of state and economic organs, supporting and developing the roots of new things, and combating stagnation and complacency. Large-scale criticism and self-criticism are of immense importance for the realization of these tasks. The article concludes: We must never forget that the development, prosperity, and comprehensive consolidation of the people's democratic countries are a great contribution to the cause of peace and mean the strengthening of the entire anti-war camp.

The editorial of issue No. 43 is "Trade Unions Fighting for Peace." The editorial points out: Trade unions are one of the largest mass organizations among the working people, and precisely because of this, they bear a very important task in the nationwide movement for peace. In the current situation, the victorious outcome of the entire struggle of trade unions for the interests of the working people is closely linked to the solution of the main tasks of defending peace, stopping warmongers, and banning atomic weapons. The article says: Despite all kinds of subversive actions by the enemies of the working class, the World Federation of Trade Unions is constantly growing and increasing in strength. At the beginning of 1950, the World Federation of Trade Unions already had 78 million members, an increase of 13 million compared to five years ago.

The article "The Party's Tasks in the Struggle for New Cadres in the Current General Situation" by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Polish United Workers' Party, published in issue No. 42, discusses in detail the tasks of the Polish United Workers' Party in strengthening cadre work. The article states: The movement to find new cadres and establish a cadre reserve must become a major political event for the Party, a new source of intensified activity within the Party, and a manifestation of the loyalty of Party organizations at all levels to the Party and their ideals. The article says: Using all our strength to ensure the most rapid development of new people's intellectuals while making maximum use of the old technical cadres is the basis of our cadre policy. The article says: In the struggle for new economic cadres, we must pay special attention to the cadre problem in agriculture. The Party must make serious efforts to send a group of workers with excellent abilities, a high level of political understanding, and experience to strengthen the agricultural cadres, especially the cadres of production cooperatives and state machine and tractor stations. The entire Party must understand that this is the most important form of implementing the alliance between the working class and the working peasants.

The article "Striving for Ideological Clarity and Resolve in the Communist Party to Achieve the Unity of the Working Class and the People" by Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, published in issue No. 43, discusses the current tasks of the Communist Party USA. The article points out: The most important task of the Communist Party USA at present is to work with everyone the Communist Party USA can influence, with all anti-fascists, to make every effort to realize the broadest people's united front—a fighting alliance of the people against war and against monopoly capital. When discussing the issue of establishing a people's front government in the United States, the article points out: The people's front anti-war anti-fascist government is different from the people's democratic government, and it is also incorrect to think that the people's front can automatically develop into a people's democratic regime. The reason why the Communist Party USA advocates and fights to help realize a people's front government is that the conditions for this path are developing today and in the future, and it will provide the best and easiest road forward for workers and the people. The article emphasizes that many leaders of the Communist Party USA must overcome the erroneous tendencies of right-wing opportunism and left-wing sectarianism in the united front. The article states: Now our Party is more able than ever before and must show the greatest political and organizational initiative to boldly use the tactics of the united front and strive to unite the people's forces against war and monopoly capital.

The article "The Ugly Propaganda Tricks of the Fascist Tito Clique" published in issue No. 43 says: Tito imitates Hitler's old tricks, spending money to hire some foreigners to travel to Yugoslavia, using them to promote the reactionary rule of the Tito clique and deceive the people of the world. The article reveals a despicable trick recently used by the Tito gang against New China and Vietnam, saying: The Yugoslav official Tanjug News Agency recently issued inflammatory remarks about "democratic youths from China and Vietnam" visiting Yugoslavia, which further proves the ugly propaganda tricks of the fascist Tito. A group of so-called "students" who are completely out of touch with their motherland are depicted in Belgrade as representatives of New China and New Vietnam. The Tito clique is using this trick in an attempt to confuse the Yugoslav people and make them believe that the Eastern nations are supporting the Tito gang. The article states: In order to fulfill its international obligations to the working people of Yugoslavia, democratic groups in all countries of the world must refuse any contact with the Tito clique. This alone is not enough; vigilance must be heightened against the conspiracies of the Tito secret service, and secret agents must be resolutely exposed. In order to implement their international obligations, the Communist Parties of the world are strengthening and should continue to strengthen their activities to expose the new conspiracies of the Tito bandits.

Issue No. 43 publishes "Defend World Peace" by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace.

In addition, the combined issue also carries reports on the recent meetings of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, the Central Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Sweden, the Ninth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Slovakia, the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Uruguay, and the Central Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Belgium. Among them, the report on the Ninth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Slovakia states: Some leading cadres of the Communist Party of Slovakia, such as Clementis, Husák, and Novomeský, committed bourgeois nationalist errors, which were criticized at the Ninth Plenary Session.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十二、四十三期合刊介绍
    【新华社十九日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第四十二、四十三期（总第八十一、八十二期）合刊，已经出版。
    第四十二期社论题为《加强人民民主国家的国家制度》。社论指出：业已战胜资产阶级和地主的中欧和东南欧各国的以工人阶级为首的人民民主政权，现已执行着无产阶级专政的任务，并且是无产阶级专政的形式之一。社论说：人民民主政权的实力和持久性的主要因素是人民民主政权与广大劳动人民的不可分离的联系。人民民主政权的实力在于：发展和加强工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，继续不断地改进共产党和工人党的活动并提高其领导地位，在各人民民主国家间以及人民民主国家与它们伟大的朋友苏联间结成兄弟般的联盟。该文说：巩固人民民主政权，需要国家机器的更进一步的改善，使其充满无产阶级分子，充满忠于人民的新干部，增加其革命的警惕性，订立新的社会主义的立法。必须使广大的群众更进一步参加积极的国家生活，积极参加政府机关和国家建设工作；必须在国家和经济机关的各个部门中展开反对官僚主义，反对那些对劳动人民的需要抱着一种漠不关心的态度的人们的不可调和的斗争，支持和发展新事物的根基，与停滞不前及自满自足的情绪作斗争。大规模展开批评与自我批评对于实现这些任务具有无限的重要性。该文说：我们一刻都不能忘记：各人民民主国家的发展、兴旺和全面巩固，是对于争取和平事业的一个伟大的贡献，也意味着整个反对战争阵营的加强。
    第四十三期社论是《为和平而斗争的工会》。社论指出：工会是劳动人民中最大的群众组织之一，恰恰就因为这一点，所以它在争取和平的全民运动中担负着非常重要的任务。在目前的局面下，争取劳动人民利益的工会整个斗争的胜利结果，是与保卫和平、制止战争贩子、禁用原子武器这些主要任务的解决密切联系着的。该文说：尽管工人阶级的敌人有着种种颠覆性的行动，世界工联还是在不断成长与增加力量。一九五零年初世界工联的会员已有七千八百万，较五年以前增加了一千三百万人。
    第四十二期所载波兰统一工人党主席贝鲁特的《党在目前总形势下为新干部而斗争的任务》一文，详细地论述了波兰统一工人党在加强干部工作方面的任务。该文说：物色新干部与建立干部后备军的运动，必须成为党的重大政治事件，成为党内加紧活动的一个新源泉，成为各级党的组织效忠于党并对党的理想忠心耿耿的一个表现。该文说：用全力来保证最迅速地发展新的人民知识分子，同时并尽量利用旧的技术干部，这就是我们干部政策的基础。该文说：在为新的经济干部而斗争中，我们要对农业中的干部问题予以特别的注意。党必须作严重的努力，派遣一批具有优秀的能力、高度的政治水平与经验的工人来加强农业干部，特别是生产合作社和国家机器与拖拉机站的干部。全党必须懂得这是实行工人阶级与劳动农民联盟的最重要的形式。
    第四十三期所载美国共产党总书记但尼斯的《争取共产党的思想明确性与坚决性以实现工人阶级与人民的团结》一文，论述了美国共产党当前任务问题。该文指出：目前美国共产党的最主要任务，就是和美国共产党可以影响的一切人、一切反法西斯人士在一起，尽一切努力，实现最广泛的人民统一战线——一个人民反战争反垄断资本的战斗联合。该文论到在美国建立人民阵线政府的问题时指出：人民阵线的反战反法西斯政府与人民民主政府是不同的，以为人民阵线能够自动发展为人民民主政权的想法也是不对的。美国共产党所以主张并为协助实现人民阵线政府而斗争，是因在今天以及将来时期，这个道路的条件正在发展中，并且它将为工人及人民提供最好及最容易的前进的道路。该文强调指出，美国共产党的许多领导者必须克服在统一战线中的右倾机会主义与左倾宗派主义的错误倾向。该文说：现在我们的党比过去任何时候都能够而且必须表现最大的政治上与组织上的主动性，来大胆地运用统一战线的策略，为争取人民反战争反垄断资本的力量的团结而奋斗。
    第四十三期所登载的《法西斯铁托集团的丑恶的宣传把戏》一文说：铁托模仿希特勒的故技，花钱雇一些外国人到南斯拉夫游历，利用他们为铁托集团的反动统治宣传，欺骗世界人民。该文揭露铁托匪帮最近对新中国和越南所使用的一个卑劣诡计说：南斯拉夫官方的坦经通讯社最近又发出了关于《来自中国及越南的民主青年》访问南斯拉夫的煽动性的言论，这件事进一步证明了法西斯铁托的丑恶的宣传伎俩。一群完全与他们的祖国失掉联系的所谓“学生”，在贝尔格莱德被描写成新中国新越南的代表。铁托集团使用这种诡计，是企图混淆南斯拉夫人民的视听，使他们相信东方民族是在拥护铁托匪帮集团。该文称：为了执行对南斯拉夫劳动人民的国际义务，全世界各国的民主团体都要拒绝与铁托集团的任何来往。单是这样还不够，对于铁托特务集团的阴谋必须提高警觉，坚决地检举特务分子。全世界的共产党为了贯彻他们的国际义务，正在加强而且应该继续加强他们的活动来暴露铁托匪徒的新的阴谋。
    第四十三期登载了中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若的《保卫世界和平》一文。
    此外，合刊并登载了关于最近美国共产党全国委员会会议、瑞典共产党中央全会、斯洛伐克共产党九中全会、乌拉圭共产党第十五届大会、比利时共产党中央全会的报道。其中关于斯洛伐克共产党九中全会的报道说：斯洛伐克共产党的一部分领导干部克里孟梯斯、呼萨克、诺伏穆斯基等曾犯有资产阶级民族主义的错误，这种错误在九中全会上受到批判。
