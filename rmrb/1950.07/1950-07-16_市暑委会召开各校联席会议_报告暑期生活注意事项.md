　　Municipal Summer Committee Convenes Joint Meeting of Schools
    Reports on Summer Life Precautions
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Youth Summer Life Committee convened a joint meeting of student unions, Communist Youth League branches, and publicity groups from various schools on the 9th of this month. At the meeting, Zhang Dazhong, the vice director of the committee and deputy secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, reported on several issues concerning summer life. He first explained that the characteristic of this year's summer is that, due to the influence of the situation and the results of political and ideological education conducted since the liberation of Beijing, students have made great progress in their thinking and have initially established a revolutionary outlook on life. Therefore, the basic spirit of this year's summer activities is to guide students to have good rest, engage in activities beneficial to their health, and prepare to study better in the next semester. Finally, he put forward seven points of attention in summer life for students to refer to: 1. Get sufficient rest, pay attention to physical exercise, and improve health. 2. Participate in one or two recreational and sports activities according to your own interests, so that summer life can be relaxed and enjoyable. 3. Read one or two revolutionary literary works, and participate in lectures you like, to cultivate an interest in literature and art, and expand the field of knowledge. 4. Appropriately review your lessons, study subjects you like, and read some science books to deepen and enrich your knowledge of regular courses. 5. Make a simple and feasible life plan, achieve regular work and rest, have a regular life, and develop the habit of reading newspapers and listening to the radio every day. 6. Establish close friendships with classmates and spend a good summer life together. 7. Prevent any lifestyles that are harmful to physical and mental health, and do not read improper novels, etc. (Summer Committee Publicity Group)
