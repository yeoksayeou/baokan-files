　　[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] The 400,000 farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are enthusiastically responding to the call for the "Movement Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea." The Municipal Farmers' Association began arranging publicity and mobilization work on July 19th. Around July 21st, mass rallies were held in various districts and villages, or various methods were used, combined with specific tasks such as the summer grain requisition, to widely carry out publicity activities. The farmers expressed their determination to fulfill the task of increasing agricultural production by 10% in 1950 to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the Korean people.
　　At the joint meeting of directors of farmers' associations in the suburbs convened by the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Association on the afternoon of July 19th, the publicity methods and steps for launching the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea were discussed. At the meeting, Chai Zemin, director of the Municipal Farmers' Association, made a report. The report pointed out: This American aggression against Korea and Taiwan has further exposed the consistent aggressive policy of the imperialist bandits. Such behavior has aroused unparalleled indignation and strong resistance from peace-loving people all over the world. All farmers in the suburbs will join hands with the working brothers and all the people of Beijing to launch a movement against American aggression.
　　More Than Half of the Suburban Population Has Participated in the Peace Signature Campaign
　　Various districts have combined the peace signature campaign with in-depth publicity. More than 330,000 people in the suburbs of Beijing have participated in the peace signature campaign, accounting for more than 50% of the total suburban population, of which 200,000 are farmers, accounting for half of the 400,000 farmers.
　　Municipal Farmers' Association Holds Forum for Rural Women
　　The Municipal Farmers' Association held a forum for rural women in the suburbs on July 23rd. At the meeting, the women unanimously expressed their enthusiastic desire to repel American imperialist aggression and defend world peace. Fu Li, from Luodaozhuang in the western suburbs, said: "For many years, we have been oppressed by the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang. Today, we have finally looked forward to liberation, but the American imperialists are launching a war to invade Taiwan and Korea. We must oppose it." Li Zhi, from Maizidian in the eastern suburbs, said: "I will work hard in production, protect the fruits of land reform, prevent sabotage by special agents, keep an eye on the seedlings, and ensure a good autumn harvest to support the liberation of Taiwan!"
　　Rural Communist Youth League Members Take the Lead in Publicity
　　Five thousand rural Communist Youth League members in the suburbs are actively taking the lead in publicizing the atrocities of American aggression. League members in Xihongmen in the southern suburbs led young people to organize radio and blackboard newspaper groups. League member Bai Shurong broadcast to the masses: "American imperialism is just a paper tiger. We must unite and expose it. Now, we must ensure the rapid payment of public grain and complete the summer requisition task to support the front and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible." Communist Youth League members in Shijiacun talked to the masses separately, using their own confidence in defending world peace to inspire the broad masses.
　　Shijingshan District Combines Summer Requisition with Publicity
　　Shijingshan District convened a farmers' representative meeting on the 21st, combining the summer requisition work with publicity. When the farmers heard the report mentioning the glorious victory of the Korean People's Army, all the representatives responded with prolonged applause. After the meeting, the representatives unanimously stated: "We will go back and mobilize everyone to pay public grain early and complete the summer requisition task, and support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible."
　　Military Dependents in the Seventeenth District, Old Lady Zhang, Said: My Son Can Only Come Home After Taiwan Is Liberated
　　On July 25th, the Seventeenth District of Beijing convened a joint meeting of military dependents' representatives and civil affairs committee members to distribute preferential grain for military dependents for the summer of 1950 and arrange for the inspection of substitute farming work. Before the meeting, the staff of the district government briefly reported on the situation of American imperialist aggression against Korea and obstruction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's liberation of Taiwan. This immediately aroused the anger of everyone present towards American imperialism. Then, the problems in the distribution of preferential grain and substitute farming work were reported. During the ten-minute break in the middle of the meeting, the representatives and civil affairs committee members who attended the meeting gathered in twos and threes to talk.
　　A civil affairs committee member said: "...We only heard that the United States was fighting in Korea, but we didn't know the details. After this talk, I realized that American imperialism is really evil. I will go back and tell the village government to do a good job in production and take good care of military dependents to support our People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan." Then, a military dependents' representative, Old Lady Zhang, said: "I didn't know about these things before. A few days ago, I wrote to my Baoxing (Old Lady Zhang's son, now a squad leader in the Second Field Army) and asked him to come home and see me before going back. After your talk, I understand. I will write to him again and definitely not ask him to come back. It won't be too late to ask him to come back when Taiwan is liberated."
　　Peasant Congresses Universally Held in the Fourteenth District of Beijing
　　Around July 21st, peasant congresses were universally held in various villages in the Fourteenth District of Beijing, combining the arrangement of summer requisitions to publicize and explain the atrocities of American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and the victorious situation of the Korean People's Liberation War. Mass rallies were held in Nanyuan, Jixian, Wudian, and Xingu villages to carry out publicity. The Communist Youth League of Shijiacun also staged a street play "Against American Imperialist Aggression" and wrote letters to the Korean youth. On the 24th, the Nanyuan Town Cultural Center put on a play by children to promote opposition to American aggression.
　　Cadres and Students Conduct In-Depth Activities in Rural Areas
　　In order to widely launch the movement against American imperialist aggression in the suburbs, cadres from various districts are now going to the countryside to carry out publicity in conjunction with the summer requisition work. Mass rallies of 1,000 to 2,000 people were held in Nanyuan Town in the southern suburbs and Yongshiying Village in the northern suburbs. On the 21st, trade unions, farmers' associations, and organizations in the eastern suburbs held forums. All the students of the Tenth Municipal Middle School in Changxindian in the Fifteenth District went out to conduct publicity. Students from Tsinghua, Yenching, and Renmin University also went deep into the countryside to carry out publicity activities. A roar against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea echoed throughout the rural areas of Beijing.
