　　Greeting the Great "July 1st"!
    Workers in Various Regions Launch Gift-Giving Campaign.
    Several Factories Have Completed Half-Year Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Newspaper] Workers all over the country are universally launching a campaign to present gifts in celebration of "July 1st." From Harbin in the north to Guangzhou in the south, factory and mine workers in more than a dozen large and medium-sized cities are, with incomparable joy and excitement, universally launching a wave of production competitions to greet the arrival of the birthday of their class's political party.
    In the "July 1st" production competition, thanks to the working class's high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, the Changxindian Railway Factory took the lead in completing its first half-year production tasks ahead of schedule on June 10th. Following this, the Jilin 41 Factory Foundry, the Lushun-Dalian Far East Electricity Caustic Soda Plant, the joint state-private Yaohua Glass Factory, and the Shenyang Chemical Factory also completed their half-year production tasks ahead of schedule. As of June 27th, all major products from the steel mills and mines in North China, with the exception of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, have exceeded their half-year production tasks. Taking the Tianjin Steel Plant as an example, its steel ingot production exceeded the half-year plan by 6.7 percent, steel by 1.2 percent, ferromanganese by 19.3 percent, and electrodes by 17 percent. After the Tangshan Steel Plant successfully trialed the double-strand steelmaking method, the output and quality of electric furnace steel ingots both improved. The Kaifeng East Repair Factory guarantees to complete the entire year's production tasks by the end of August, and the factory's iron workshop and sand casting department will complete the entire year's tasks by "July 1st."
    In the Northeast region, improving quality, reducing waste, and lowering costs are the main content of this competition. Many factories have achieved significant results. Taking the Lushun-Dalian Light Bulb Factory as an example, the semi-finished light bulbs produced by the factory's glass workshop have surged from an average daily output of 30,000 to 39,500, breaking the field's historical record, while defective products have fallen from 6.25 percent in the past to 3.13 percent.
    To show their support and love for the Party, railway workers across the country have launched a vigorous gift-giving campaign. Various units of the Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and Hengyang Railway Bureaus have been drawn into the competition. Various units of the Guangzhou Branch have universally established merit competition committees as leading bodies for the movement. The "August 1st" locomotive of the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot guarantees to complete 60,000 kilometers of safe operation before "July 1st" and strive to join the model locomotive team. The "Old Iron Ox" contracted team of the Suihua Locomotive Depot in Northeast China safely traveled 174,100 kilometers during the Red May competition, eliminating accidents large and small; in June, they set out a work plan for 60 percent punctuality, coal saving, and oil saving. At the beginning of the month, the Shenyang South Station Goods Department challenged the Harbin Station, guaranteeing no accidents and striving to exceed loading and unloading tasks. The Harbin Station wrote in its letter of response: "Our two brother special-class stations will plant the red flag in the north and south as a gift to welcome the Party's birthday."
    In this nationwide gift-giving campaign, Party members and Youth League members are actively playing a leading role. Labor heroes and advanced producers are working with redoubled efforts. Li Jinghua, a special-class labor model on the Northeast Railway, has set out the following plan: (1) To promote the fourteen contracted passenger groups of the Jilin Train Section to formulate plans and exchange experiences, so that more than half of the groups become Iron Ox team members. (2) To patiently educate train attendants and ensure that more than 70 percent of the train attendants in the entire section can handle passenger transport business independently. (3) To ensure that the group has no accidents before "July 1st" as a gift to the Party. Women in some areas have also automatically joined this movement. The women's federations of the Ningjia Work Area and the Hunan Work Area of the Baichengzi Engineering Section in Northeast China jointly issued a challenge with ten conditions to the work areas under their jurisdiction, demanding that they help male workers weed six kilometers before "July 1st."
    From Northeast China to South China, the staff and workers of various factories are using their spare time to wave red flags, beat gongs and drums, rehearse dramas, practice dancing, compile wall newspapers, and write slogans. They are not only using tense labor but also happy hearts to welcome the great "July 1st."

　　迎接伟大的“七一”！
    各地职工展开献礼运动
    若干工厂已提前完成半年生产任务
    【本报讯】全国各地职工普遍开展迎接“七一”献礼运动。从北边的哈尔滨到南边的广州市，十余个大中城市的厂矿职工，以无比欢欣愉快的心情，普遍掀起生产竞赛热潮，来迎接自己阶级政党的生日的到来。
    在“七一”生产竞赛运动中，由于工人阶级发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，长辛店铁路工厂首于六月十日提前完成上半年生产任务，继有吉林四一工厂铸工场、旅大远东电业苛性曹达职场、公私合营耀华玻璃厂、沈阳化工厂等亦先后提前完成半年生产任务；截至六月二十七日止，华北各钢铁厂矿除太原钢铁厂外，各种主要产品均已超额完成半年生产任务。以天津制钢厂为例：该厂所产之钢锭，超过半年计划百分之六·七，钢材超过百分之一·二，锰铁超过百分之十九·三，电极超过百分之十七；唐山制钢厂试行双联炼钢法成功后，使电炉钢锭的产量与质量均有增进。开封东修配厂则保证在八月底完成全年生产任务，该厂之铁工厂及翻砂部将于“七一”完成全年任务。
    在东北地区，提高质量，减少废品，降低成本是此次竞赛运动的主要内容，不少工厂均已收到显著成绩。以旅大灯泡工厂为例，该厂玻璃职场所产灯泡半成品，由每天平均产三万个突增到三万九千五百个，打破该场历史上的最高纪录，不良品则由过去百分之六点二五降到百分之三·一三。
    全国铁路职工为了表示自己对党的拥护和热爱，纷纷掀起了如火如荼的献礼运动。天津、郑州、衡阳路局各单位多已卷入竞赛运动。广州分局各单位普遍建立了立功竞赛委员会，作为运动的领导机构，江岸机务段“八一”号机车，保证在“七一”前完成安全走行六万公里任务，争取加入模范机车队。东北绥化机务段“老铁牛”包车组在红五月竞赛中，已安全走行十七万四千一百公里，消灭了大小事故；六月份又订出正点、节煤和节省油脂百分之六十的工作计划。沈阳南站货物处在月初向哈尔滨车站提出挑战，保证不出事故，争取超过装卸任务等。哈尔滨车站在应战书上写道：“我们两个兄弟特等站，要把红旗插在一南一北，作为迎接党生日的献礼。”
    在这一全国性的献礼运动中，各地党员、团员积极地起了带头作用。劳动英雄和先进生产者以加倍的努力劳动着。东北铁路特等劳动模范李静华订出这样的计划：（一）要推动吉林列车段十四个包乘组订计划，交流经验，使半数以上的组成为铁牛队员。（二）耐心教育列车员，保证全段列车员百分之七十以上能单独处理客运业务。（三）保证该组“七一”前不出任何事故，来做为贡献给党的礼物。若干地区的妇女也自动卷入这一运动，东北白城子工务段宁家工区和湖南工区的妇联会，联合向管内各工区提出十项条件的挑战，要在“七一”以前帮助男工拔草六公里。
    从东北到华南，各厂职工正利用工余时间，挥舞着红旗，敲打着锣鼓，排话剧，练舞蹈，编墙报，写标语。他们不仅用紧张的劳动，而且也用快乐的心情来迎接伟大的“七一”。
