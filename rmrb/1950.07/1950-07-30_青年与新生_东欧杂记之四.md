　　Youth and Rebirth
    ——Eastern Europe Miscellany Four
    Feng Zhi

    On May 28th, the second day of the All-German Youth Congress, we stood on the reviewing stand watching a procession of 700,000 young people march past. Sometimes thick clouds gathered in the sky, followed by a burst of rain, and sometimes a faint sunlight appeared, but the procession maintained the same orderliness and enthusiasm from beginning to end. Neither the reviewers nor the marchers paid any attention to the changing weather. Whether it rained or the sun shone, their determination to defend peace was forever consistent. Everyone sang, cheered, applauded, and responded, without a moment's pause from eight in the morning to five in the afternoon. Images of Lenin, images of Stalin, images of President Pieck, images of revolutionary leaders from various countries; flags large and small, various bouquets, colorful balloons; various slogans, eye-catching pictures—everywhere showing the creative talents of young people. We stood in the wind and rain, watching this lively scene, feeling only excitement, not fatigue. Standing beside me at this time were two old men, looking no more than sixty years old, but one of the cadres who was hosting us pointed to them and said softly to me that these two old comrades had once worked with Engels. I was surprised to hear this. We calculated that Engels died in 1895, so these two old men must be at least eighty years old. "Perhaps more than eighty years old," the cadre replied.
    Out of curiosity and respect, I began to talk to one of the two old men, about his life in a Nazi concentration camp, about the new Chinese literature. Finally I asked him, "I heard that you worked with Engels?"
    He paused for a moment, looking at the endless procession of young people, and said in a calm voice, "I was dreaming in my youth, and now the youth have realized the dream."
    I did not agree with this sentence in my heart. The struggle of the international working class led by Engels at the end of the nineteenth century was as real as iron, how could it be said to be a dream? There was some sentimentality mixed in the happiness of this sentence.
    But when I raised my head and looked at the dilapidated buildings around me, I couldn't help but recall the words of Ehrenburg, a guest at the conference, that I had just read in the newspaper. He said, "This is a tragic, but also optimistic, scene, seeing so many life-affirming young people in the ruins of Berlin. This scene reminds people of the tragic past of a nation. Today, an unshakable will for peace fills the hearts of the German people. The current task of German youth is to do everything possible to ensure that Germany never becomes a battlefield of bloodshed again."
    Indeed, the past history of the German people has been tragic. But not because they lost two wars, but because they were constantly fooled by their rulers and became the culprits of two world wars. Germany's history for the past hundred years has been a history of aggression: the Junkers and the emerging big capitalists colluded with each other, showing Bismarck's arrogance, William II's arrogance and Hitler's cruelty and shamelessness, causing the progressive forces in the country to be constantly devastated and attacked. It was not until May 1945, when the great Soviet army liberated Berlin, that the Nazi bandits were arrested, committed suicide, or fled, that people woke up from a long nightmare, facing a pile of ruins, dumbfounded and at a loss, not knowing what to do tomorrow.
      At this time, those Communists who had suffered persecution by the fascists gradually returned, some from concentration camps, some from their exile abroad. They returned to take on arduous and important work. They not only had to clear the ruins along the streets, but also had to clear the spiritual ruins of the people; they not only had to build new houses, but also had to build new people. They then formed a unified party of workers, led the National Front, which gave rise to the German Democratic Republic; they implemented land reform, nationalized the factories of war criminals, and changed the social foundation; they launched labor competitions in factories and established tractor lending stations in rural areas to increase production. In this way, in less than five years, thanks to the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and the help of the Soviet Union, the face of East Germany was completely renewed. The new republic's national anthem begins by singing—
    "Resurrected from the ruins
    We face the future."
    From here, I gradually understood the mood of the old man when he said those words. His past work itself was not a dream, but looking at the current scene, thinking of the reactionary history of Germany in the past fifty years, the failures and setbacks he suffered in it, would really give him a dreamlike feeling.
    German youth played a big role in the success of these five years. Many middle-aged and older people in Germany have gone through too many changes. They have gone through the militarism of the William II era, the economic panic of the late Weimar Republic, and the decades of deception by the fascists. Their minds have become slick, their senses have become dull, and they have lost their sensitivity to new things. But the youth, without so many past burdens, can keenly see the new prospects ahead. In the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, young people are loved, but Germany, due to this special situation, has more expectations of young people. And the youth have not failed this expectation. They have taken the lead in responding to all the government's calls, whether in cities or in rural areas.
    In the year after liberation, May 1946, the Free German Youth League proposed that the younger generation should enjoy four basic rights: the right to participate in politics, the right to work, the right to education, and the right to happiness. Today, youth participate in party cadres, mass organizations, various agencies, various economic departments, and in parliament; every youth has a job, they have confidence in the future, and do not have to worry that they will not be able to find a job one day and have to spend the night on the streets; everyone has the opportunity to receive education. Before the war, children of workers and peasants accounted for only two or three percent of the universities, but now they account for more than twenty-five percent; as for the psychological and physical health and happiness of young people, we see youth sanatoriums, youth hostels, youth clubs everywhere… and youth drama troupes, cultural work troupes, and sports organizations are developing in large numbers.
    Due to the active participation of young people in political and economic activities, and the outstanding achievements, everyone believes that today's young people are completely different from the little hotheads who were fooled by militarism and fascism in the past. They have clear thinking and the ability to handle affairs. Therefore, at the Youth Conference for the Defense of Peace on the 27th, the government announced a recently passed decree to advance the age of adulthood by two years, from the age of twenty to the age of eighteen, so that young people have more opportunities to serve the people.
    Since the Free German Youth League announced the date of the All-German Youth Congress, the youth in the Republic have made great efforts to welcome this unprecedented event. They used their own labor to build a stadium in Berlin that can accommodate 80,000 people, a conference hall that can accommodate 10,000 people, and a Young Pioneer Republic that can accommodate 20,000 people in the forest outside Berlin. They actively participated in labor competitions in factories and rural areas. In the labor competition movement, 100,000 young people participated from 1948 to 1949, and rural youth and female youth accounted for a small number, but in the year from 1949 to 1950, 280,000 young people participated, including 59,000 from rural areas and 60,000 women. The literary and artistic workers of the youth also competed to create new songs, write new dramas, cultivate folk dances, and send paintings and sculptures to Berlin for exhibition. And the Free German Youth League launched the "Excellent Knowledge" examination. Those who pass the examination can get bronze, silver, and gold medals according to the different levels. Those who participate in this examination must be familiar with Kalinin's "On Communist Education," Ostrovsky's "How Steel Was Tempered," Bredel's "Biography of Thälmann," and the works of Goethe, Heine, and Gorky; they must understand the history of the German workers' movement, the nature of the German Democratic Republic, the spirit of internationalism, and the significance of the model worker movement. In addition, there is another most important task, that is, every young person who comes to Berlin to participate in the conference must bring at least ten signatures for the defense of peace and the banning of atomic bombs, so in the final calculation, 700,000 young people brought 8 million signatures. — In this multi-faceted constructive preparation, the thinking of every young person has made great progress.
    This generation of young people is foreshadowing a rebirth that has never existed in German history. This is also the result of the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and the education of the Free German Youth League. But what is the situation of German youth in West Germany, in the occupied areas of Britain, the United States and France? The number of homeless children on the streets is increasing day by day, the number of unemployed youth has reached one million, girls are forced into prostitution, and boys are forced to go to colonies such as Vietnam and Indonesia to serve as mercenaries. At the beginning of this year, a Swiss newspaper, "Luzerner Neuste Nachrichten," recorded this: "People traffickers from six countries recruit two thousand to two thousand five hundred young Germans every month to serve in the army. That is not just recruiters from France and Britain, but also agents from Franco's Spain and Argentina." And other countries are also eyeing this good business and are eager to try. An American journalist reported that the biggest gain of the King of Iran's visit to the United States was to obtain the United States' permission to gather a large number of Nazi-era officers in Germany to serve in the Iranian army. This phenomenon is something that even the puppet government of West Germany cannot conceal. It has to put the following title in a statement: "Youth have no jobs - people have no future."
    In fact, the youth of West Germany will have jobs, and the people of West Germany will also have a future, as long as the British and American imperialists get out of West Germany and take away the entire machine of the West German puppet government. The progressive youth of West Germany see this truth very clearly. Their determination to defend peace and strive for unity is no different from that of the youth of East Germany. Therefore, they regard this conference as the first bugle call to foreshadow the unification of Germany. They are looking forward to the arrival of the conference date with hot tension. But the puppet government of West Germany tried every means to obstruct it, not only refusing to give them passports to cross the border, but also closing the border. Even so, some young people still crossed the blockade line at night or in rainy weather, taking advantage of people's inattention. In this way, not only 20,000 young people came over, but also many Young Pioneer members, as well as their parents, followed. After the conference was over, they held up the banner of victory, lined up, and sang songs back to West Germany. A group of two thousand people, as soon as they crossed the border of the British occupied area, were surrounded by the police in a wasteland. Those policemen said that they had received an order from the "government" saying that there was a typhoid epidemic in East Berlin, and that young people from East Berlin had to register and be inspected. But these young people resolutely refused to register. They said, "East Berlin is the cleanest place, with neither venereal disease nor typhoid fever. Calling us to register is a conspiracy with ulterior motives." The police surrounded them for two days and nights. In the end, there was no way but to let these young people hold up the banner of victory, line up, sing songs, and walk away. (Attached picture)

　　青年与新生
    ——东欧杂记之四
    冯至
    五月二十八日，全德青年大会的第二天，我们站在检阅台上望着七十万青年组成的队伍从我们面前走过。天空中时而聚起浓云，紧接着是一阵骤雨，时而又露出微薄的阳光，队伍从头到尾都保持着同样的整齐与热烈。检阅的和游行的没有一人把天气的变化放在心上，下雨也罢，出太阳也罢，保卫和平的决心是永久一致的。大家歌唱，欢呼，鼓掌，应答，从上午八点到下午五点，中间没有片刻的停息。列宁的像，斯大林的像，皮克总统的像，各国革命领袖的像；大大小小的旗帜，各样的花束，彩色的轻气球；各种标语，引人注目的图画——处处表示出青年人创造的才能。我们站在风雨里，看着这个热闹的景象，只是兴奋，没有疲倦。这时在我身边站着两个老人，望去不过六十岁左右，但是招待我们的一位干部却指着他们轻轻地向我说，这两个老同志曾经和恩格斯一起工作过。我听了这话，感到惊奇。我们推算，恩格斯在一八九五年逝世，那么这两个老人至少该有八十岁了。“也许比八十岁还多”，那干部回答。
    我由于好奇与尊敬便和两个老人里的一个谈起话来，谈起他在纳粹集中营里的生活，谈起中国的新文艺。最后我问他，“听说你和恩格斯一起工作过？”
    他停了片刻，望着那无穷无尽的青年队伍，他用沉着的声音说：“我青年时候是作梦，现在的青年把梦给实现了。”
    我听了这句话，心里不以为然。十九世纪末恩格斯领导的国际工人阶级的斗争都是铁一样地真实，怎么能说是作梦呢？这句话快乐里多少掺杂着一些感伤的成份。
    但是我抬起头来，望一望四围残破的建筑，不由地想起方才在报纸上读到的大会里的一位贵宾爱伦堡的谈话，他说：“这是一个悲惨的，同时也是乐观的景象，在柏林的废墟中间看见这么多生活肯定的年青的人。这景象使人想起一个民族的悲惨的过去。如今一个不可动摇的和平意志充满了德国人民的心。德国青年的当前任务便是尽一切的力量使德国不再有一次成为流血的战场。”
    诚然，德国人民过去的历史是悲惨的。但并不是因为他们打了两回败仗，却是因为他们不断地受着他们统治者的愚弄，作了两次大战的祸首。德国一百年来的历史是一部侵略史：容克地主与新兴的大资本家互相勾结，表现出俾斯麦的骄横，维廉第二的狂妄与希特勒的残酷无耻，致使国内进步的势力随时都受着摧残和打击。直到一九四五年五月，伟大的苏军把柏林解放了，纳粹匪徒们被捕的被捕，自杀的自杀，逃亡的逃亡，人们才从长期的噩梦里醒过来，面对着一片废墟，目瞪口呆，手足失措，不知道明天要做些什么事。
      这时，那些受尽法西斯的迫害的共产党人渐渐回来了，有的从集中营里，有的从他们流亡的外国。他们回来，担任起艰难而重大的工作，他们不但要清理街旁的废墟，而且要清理人们精神上的废墟，不但要建设新房屋，而且要建设新人。他们于是组成了工人的统一的政党，领导了民族阵线，由此产生了德意志民主共和国；他们实行了土改，把战犯们的工厂收归国有，改变了社会基础；在工厂里发动劳动竞赛，在农村里设立拖拉机出借站，使生产提高。这样，不满五年的岁月，由于统一社会党的领导与苏联的帮助，东德的面貌焕然一新，新的共和国的国歌一开始就这样歌唱——
    “从废墟里复活
    我们面向将来。”
    从这里我也就渐渐理会了那老人说那句话时的心情。他过去的工作本身并不是梦，而是看着当前的景象，想起德国过去五十年一套反动的历史，他在其中所受的失败与挫折，真会有一种如梦的感觉。
    这五年内的成功，德国青年起了很大的作用。德国许多中年以后的人，因为经过的变化太多了，他们经过维谦第二时代的军国主义，经过魏马共和国后期的经济恐慌，经过法西斯十几年的愚弄，头脑已经油滑，感觉已经迟钝，对于新的事物失却感应。可是青年，没有那么多过去的负担，能够锐敏地看得清面前新的远景。在苏联和新民主主义国家都是爱青年的，但德国由于这种特殊情形，它对青年有更多的期望。而青年也没有喜负这个期望，他们对于政府的一切号召，无论在城市或是在农村，都带头响应。
    解放后的一年，一九四六年五月，自由德国青年联盟便提出来年青的一代应该享受四种基本权利：有权利参与政治，有权利工作，有权利受教育，有权利快乐。如今在党的干部里，在群众组织，各机关，各经济部门，以及议会里，都有青年参加了；每个青年都有了工作，他们对将来具有信心，无须顾虑会有一天找不到职业，必须在街头过夜；人人都有了受教育的机会，战前大学里工农子弟不过占百分之二、三，现在则超过了百分之二十五；至于为了青年心理上和生理上的健康与快乐，我们到处看见青年休养所、青年旅舍、青年俱乐部……并且青年剧团、文工团、体育团体都大批在发展着。
    由于青年积极地参加了政治的与经济的活动而显露出卓越的成绩，大家都认为现在的青年与往日被军国主义与法西斯所愚弄的小热昏完全不同了，他们具有明确的思想与处理事务的才能。于是政府在二十七日青年保卫和平大会上宣布了一条最近通过的法令，把成人的年龄提前二年，从满二十岁提前到满十八岁，使青年有更多的机会为人民服务。
    自从自由德国青年联盟公布了全德青年大会的会期以来，共和国里的青年便用了极大的努力来迎接这空前的盛会。他们用自己的劳力在柏林建筑起能容八万人的体育场，一座能容一万人的大会场，从柏林郊外森林里开辟出一个能容二万人的少先队共和国。在工厂和农村里积极参加劳动竞赛。在劳动竞赛的运动中一九四八年到四九年有十万青年参加，乡村青年和女性青年占有很少的数目，但等到四九年至五零年这一年内便有二十八万青年参加，其中有五万九千是农村的，六万是女性。青年的文学与艺术的工作者也竞赛似地创造新歌，编写新剧，培养民间舞蹈，把绘画和雕刻送到柏林来展览。并且自由德国青年联盟发动“学识优良”的考试，考试及格的按着等级的不同可以得到铜色的、银色的、金色的三种奖章。参加这个考试的人要读熟加里宁的《论共产主义教育》，奥斯特罗夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》，布雷德尔的《台尔曼传》，以及歌德、海涅、高尔基的著作；他们要了解德国工人运动的历史，德意志民主共和国国家的性质，国际主义的精神与劳模运动的意义。此外，还有一件最重要的任务，即是每个到柏林来参加大会的青年，至少要带来十个人的保卫和平、禁用原子弹的签名，所以最后结算，七十万青年带来了八百万个签名。——在这多方面建设性的准备中，每个青年的思想都获得了很大的进步。
    这样一代的青年在预告着一种在德国历史上不曾有过的新生，这也是统一社会党的领导与自由德国青年联盟的教育所发生的成果。但是在西德，在英美法的占领区里，德国的青年是怎样的情况呢？街头上无家可归的流浪儿童一天比一天增多，青年失业者的数目达到一百万，女孩子被迫卖淫，男孩子被迫到越南、印度尼西亚等殖民地去充当雇佣兵。今年年初瑞士一家报纸“鲁森新闻”这样记载着：“有六个国家的人贩子每月要招募二千到二千五百名年青的德国人去服兵役。那不只是法国的与英国的招募者，却也有佛朗哥的西班牙与阿根廷的代理人。”并且旁的国家也看上这笔好生意，都跃跃欲试。一个美国记者报道伊朗国王访美的最大的收获是获得美国的允许，在德国招集大批纳粹时代的军官到伊朗军队里服务。这现象，就是西德的傀儡政府都无法遮饰，它不得不在一篇文告里这样标题：“青年没有职业——人民没有将来。”
    事实上西德的青年是会有职业的，西德的人民也会有将来的，只要英美帝国主义者从西德滚开，还带走西德傀儡政府的全部机器。这道理西德进步的青年看得很清楚，他们保卫和平，争取统一的决心和东德的青年并没有两样，所以他们把这次的大会看成预告德国统一的第一声号角，他们怀着热烈的紧张的心情期待着大会日期的到来。但是西德的傀儡政府却百般阻挠，不但不给他们通过边界的护照，而且把边界封锁起来。虽然如此，还是有些青年有的在夜里，有的在下雨的时刻，乘人不注意越过封锁线。这样不只是青年过来了二万，还有许多少先队队员，以及他们的父母也跟着过来。大会开完了，他们举着胜利的旗帜，排着队，唱着歌，回到西德。有一个两千人的队伍，一越过英国占领区的边界，便在一片荒野地方被警察围住了。那些警察说，奉到“政府”的命令，说是东柏林有伤寒病流行，从东柏林来的青年都要登记，受检查。但是这些青年坚决拒绝登记，他们说，“东柏林是一块最干净的地方，既没有花柳病，也没有伤寒病，叫我们登记，是别有居心的阴谋。”警察围他们围了两昼夜，最后没有办法，只好让这些青年举着胜利的旗帜，排着队，唱着歌，走去了。（附图片）
