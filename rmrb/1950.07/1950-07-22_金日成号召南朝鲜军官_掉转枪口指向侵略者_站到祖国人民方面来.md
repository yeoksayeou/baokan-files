Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 19th: Pyongyang Radio recently broadcast a letter from Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, to officers of the Syngman Rhee puppet army. General Kim Il-sung said: "Division commanders and officers serving in the Syngman Rhee puppet government army! You now have no 'government,' no 'National Assembly,' and no 'General Staff Headquarters.' They have all fled, leaving you at the mercy of the American imperialists. Who is issuing orders now, and who is commanding the troops you lead? It is the US military's General Staff Headquarters and American officers. Do not stand on the side of the American aggressors, and do not fight against your compatriots, parents, and brothers. You must stand with the people of your country and fight against the aggressor—the United States. In this war, you are tools of the American armed aggressors, who are trying to turn your motherland into their colony and the Korean people into slaves of their colony."

General Kim Il-sung called out: "Come over to the side of the People's Army! Lead the troops you command and turn your guns on the aggressors. The motherland and the people will greatly appreciate this action and will forgive all your past deeds."

　　金日成号召南朝鲜军官
    掉转枪口指向侵略者  站到祖国人民方面来
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社平壤十九日讯：平壤电台顷广播朝鲜人民军总司令金日成告李承晚伪军军官书。金日成将军说：在李承晚傀儡政府军队里服务的师长们，军官们！你们现在没有了“政府”，没有了“国民议会”，也没有了“参谋总部”。他们都逃跑了，留下你们听任美国帝国主义者摆布。现在是谁在发布命令，是谁在指挥你们所率领的军队呢？那是美军参谋总部和美国军官们。你们不要站在美国侵略者的一边，不要和你们的同胞、父母和兄弟们作战。你们必须和你们本国的人民站在一边，和侵略者——美国——作战。你们在这次战争中是美国武装侵略者的工具，他们极力想把你们的祖国变成为他们的殖民地，把朝鲜人民变成为他们的殖民地的奴隶。
    金日成将军号召说：投到人民军方面来吧！率领你们所指挥的军队，把枪口转向侵略者。祖国和人民将非常嘉许这种行动，并将宽恕你们过去的一切。
