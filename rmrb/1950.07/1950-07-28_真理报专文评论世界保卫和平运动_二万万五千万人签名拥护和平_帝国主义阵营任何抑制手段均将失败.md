Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th: *Pravda* recently published an article by Shevlyagin titled "The Movement to Defend Peace is Irrepressible," stating that the number of people worldwide who have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal is approaching 250 million. So many signatures have shattered the original imperialist conspiracy of silence regarding it. The arrogant and contemptuous rhetoric of the bourgeois press and bourgeois politicians towards peace advocates has changed to vicious roaring. The U.S. State Department is seeking new ways to combat the growing prestige of the Peace Appeal. According to the American magazine *Newsweek*, Washington is studying the issue of "counter-petitions" and "counter-declarations" against the Peace Appeal.

To weaken the movement to defend peace, the imperialists and their lackeys have adopted cruel suppression measures against peace signature campaigns in various countries. Campaigners collecting signatures in the United States are being imprisoned on charges of violating so-called "vagrancy laws." The notorious House Un-American Activities Committee even declared on July 13 that all Americans who signed the Peace Appeal should be prosecuted. In Britain, police arrest campaigners collecting signatures on the streets, and courts sentence them to imprisonment and fines for defending peace. In Italy, counties have ordered a ban on collecting signatures. The imperialist stooge Tito clique has imprisoned tens of thousands of Yugoslav fighters for peace and democracy, attempting to conceal the Peace Appeal from the eyes of the people of that country, and is now trying to prevent the Yugoslav people from knowing about the current American aggression in Korea and the angry protests of people all over the world against this aggression.

The people of all countries have responded to these means of sabotaging and even suppressing the peace movement by participating more actively in the peace signature campaign. Now, combined with the worldwide movement to protest American aggression in Korea, hundreds of millions more signatures have been added. The militant slogan "Hands off Korea!" is resonating in various languages around the world.

The Stockholm Peace Appeal has proven to be a powerful weapon for ordinary members of political parties, religious groups, and trade unions to identify whether leaders are defending the interests of the masses. The active participation of communist parties in various countries in the peace signature campaign demonstrates that they are closely integrated with the people, fully represent their interests, and express the people's desire for peace and opposition to warmongers better and more fully than any other organization. In contrast, the leaders of the right-wing socialist parties have completely exposed themselves as enemies of peace and direct accomplices of warmongers. The Vatican has once again proven to be an accomplice of the imperialist camp. Pope Pius XII has so far not responded to the suggestion made by Italian peace advocates that he endorse the Peace Appeal. The demand made on every political, religious, and social leader to give a clear answer to the question of whether they favor peace or favor war has torn off the mask of peace that warmongers wear and revealed their cannibalistic faces, hoping to use the atomic bomb.

### 真理报专文评论世界保卫和平运动  二万万五千万人签名拥护和平  帝国主义阵营任何抑制手段均将失败

　　真理报专文评论世界保卫和平运动
    二万万五千万人签名拥护和平
    帝国主义阵营任何抑制手段均将失败
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊出谢夫里雅金所作《拥护和平的运动是不可抑制的》专文称：全世界在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的人数，已接近二亿五千万人。这么多人的签名，粉碎了帝国主义者原先对它表示沉默的阴谋。资产阶级报纸和资产阶级政客对和平拥护者表示傲慢与藐视的论调，已改变为恶毒的咆哮。美国国务院正在寻求新的方式，来对和平宣言日益增长的声望进行斗争，据美国《新闻周刊》声称：华盛顿正在研究针对和平宣言的“反请愿”问题与“反宣言”问题。
    帝国主义者及其从仆为了削弱保卫和平的运动，已对各国的和平签名运动采取残酷的镇压手段。美国征求签名的宣传员，以违犯所谓“游民律”的罪名而被监禁。恶名昭彰的非美活动委员会竟于七月十三日宣称：所有在和平宣言上签名的美国人，都要受到检举。在英国，警察在街上逮捕征求签名的宣传员，法庭因为他们保卫和平而处以徒刑和罚款。在意大利，各县下令禁止征集签名。帝国主义的庸仆铁托集团，已在监禁着几万个南斯拉夫争取和平与民主的战士，企图把和平宣言瞒过该国人民的耳目，现在并企图使南斯拉夫人民不知道美国目前在朝鲜的侵略行动以及全世界人民对这种侵略的愤怒抗议。
    各国人民对于这种破坏以至镇压和平运动手段的答复，是更加积极地参加和平签名运动。现在，结合着全世界抗议美国侵略朝鲜的运动，又增加了上万万人的签名。“不准对朝鲜动手！”的战斗性的口号，正用各种语言在世界上震响着。
    斯德哥尔摩和平宣言证明是各政党、宗教团体和工会组织的普通成员用以鉴别领袖是否保卫群众利益的有力武器，各国共产党积极参加和平签名运动，说明他们与人民密切地结合在一起，完全代表他们的利益，比任何组织更好而且更充分地表示群众要求和平反对战争贩子的愿望。与此相反，右翼社会党的领袖们已彻底暴露他们自己是和平的敌人和战争挑拨者的直接同谋犯。梵蒂冈也再度被证明是帝国主义阵营的同谋犯，教皇庇护士十二世迄今尚未答复意大利和平拥护者提出的要他赞成和平宣言的建议。向每一个政治、宗教与社会领袖提出的要他们对赞成和平抑赞成战争的问题作一明白答复的要求，撕破了战争贩子伪装和平的假面具，揭露了他们指望利用原子弹的吃人生番的鬼恶嘴脸。
