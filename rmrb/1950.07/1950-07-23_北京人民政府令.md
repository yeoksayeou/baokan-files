　　Beijing Municipality 1950 Emergency Measures for Cholera Prevention

　　I. The main scope of emergency measures to be taken in this city for cholera prevention currently is as follows:
　　1. Expand epidemic prevention publicity: Focusing on the current situation, raise public awareness, introduce simple prevention and control methods, report the epidemic situation in various places, advise on receiving preventive injections, and pay attention to food, beverage, and environmental hygiene. The Municipal Health Committee will use various methods to conduct expanded publicity. Specific measures will be formulated separately.
　　2. Epidemic reporting: When suspected cholera patients are found in the city, citizens should immediately report to the local district health center for investigation and treatment (and may also go directly to infectious disease hospitals for diagnosis and treatment). Districts without health centers should report to the district public office (government), which will forward the report to the epidemic prevention team of the Public Health Bureau. Medical personnel should report to the health center in their district for immediate investigation and handling, and then report to the epidemic prevention team of the Public Health Bureau for registration after initial diagnosis.
　　3. Quarantine: Before the implementation of quarantine work in this city, the railway department's health bureau is responsible for conducting quarantine and disinfection inside train cars for passengers arriving in Beijing by train before they disembark and enter the station. If suspected cholera patients are found, contact the Municipal Public Health Bureau for handling.
　　4. Preventive Injections: A. Primarily administer simple cholera vaccine injections. Each district health committee is responsible for designating dates and locations in stages and announcing them to the public to receive injections on schedule. Those who have not received the injection by the deadline will be given mandatory injections. B. Injections should be carried out on a large scale and in an organized manner, starting with the key implementation in the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th and 9th districts, where there are more impoverished residents. If the district's staff is insufficient, the Municipal Health Committee will send personnel to assist in completing the work. The vaccination record, which serves as a household registration supplementary page, has established a good foundation in the suburbs. During this period, it has been decided to widely adopt it in urban and suburban districts. The Public Health Bureau will rush to print and prepare them for use, and the Public Security Bureau will assist in promoting them.
　　5. Strengthen the testing and disinfection of drinking water: A. The amount of chlorine added to tap water should be increased in the near future, and it should be ensured that the tail-end areas of the southern city retain 0.1 parts per million of residual chlorine. All water source wells in the city will be temporarily suspended from water supply, and the western suburban water plant should quickly install disinfection equipment for use. B. Public drinking water wells must be universally disinfected, and the number of disinfections should be increased to two to three times a day, limiting the use to self-use and restricting public drinking (those with special reasons and approved by the Public Health Bureau are not subject to this restriction), and implement testing and disinfection. Those used exclusively for industrial use and those with poor water quality are strictly prohibited from drinking.
　　6. Strengthen the management of food and beverages: A. Cold drinks and foods: i. All shops and vendors operating cold drinks and foods must have appropriate and reasonable sanitary equipment and strengthen inspections. ii. Ice cream stick stores must have appropriate utensils for vendors to use, and only those who have been inspected and approved by the Public Health Bureau are allowed to wholesale (if the vendor prepares his own utensils that meet the conditions, he may also apply to the Public Health Bureau for inspection and approval). iii. Iced cold food should uniformly use artificial ice, except for those with air-conditioning equipment. iv. Shaved ice, dried fruit, dried apricot soup, sour jujube soup, dried fruit soup, sweet water (made of sugar or saccharin with seasonings and pigments) shall be advised to voluntarily stop selling during the epidemic prevention period, in addition to inspection and management. B. General food and beverages: i. All food directly consumed should have strict fly-proof equipment. Those that need to be iced but do not have appropriate equipment should uniformly use artificial ice. ii. Rotten food and beverages are strictly prohibited from being sold. iii. Watermelons must not be cut open for sale unless they have a tightly sealed glass or gauze cover with a door. The implementation of the above items A and B should be incorporated into sanitary covenants through the respective industry organizations, and supervised and implemented by the respective competent bureaus (Public Health Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Commercial Bureau).
　　7. Garbage and excrement disposal: During the emergency measures period for epidemic prevention, the city's garbage and excrement disposal will be coordinated with the overall prevention work by the Sanitary Engineering Bureau to actively strengthen management.
　　II. The start and end of the emergency measures period referred to in these measures shall be announced to the public by the Municipal Health Committee in writing.
　　III. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.
