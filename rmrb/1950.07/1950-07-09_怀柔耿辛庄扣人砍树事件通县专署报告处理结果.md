    Regarding the article "Cui Chenshi of Huairou Personally Comes to This Newspaper to Complain About the Local Government Detaining People and Cutting Down Trees, Hoping the Tong County Commissioner's Office Will Investigate and Handle It Promptly" published in the People's Tribune on May 20th, we read it and immediately sent personnel to Huairou County's Gengxinzhuang Village in conjunction with the county government to investigate. We are now informing you of the investigation results and the handling situation.
    Cui Chenshi's family has five members and thirty-four mu of land (the land quality is relatively poor). Last year, seven and a half mu of land were barren, and seventeen and a half mu suffered from floods and reduced harvests. The Cui family currently has two donkeys (one is a foal). According to the investigation, last year Cui Chenshi harvested two shi and four dou of wheat, and a total of four shi of corn, beans, and rice, as well as one thousand five hundred jin of sweet potatoes. Last year, she should have borne 529 jin of millet in public grain and 155 jin of local grain. Based on the above circumstances, Cui Chenshi has a certain ability to bear the burden. However, Cui Chenshi emphasized that the year was bad and attempted not to pay public grain. On January 25th of this year, the village cadres reported her failure to pay public grain to the district. The district government summoned her on February 28th to inquire about the reasons for not paying public grain. At that time, Cui Chenshi admitted that she would pay it off within ten days, but she did not do so. The district government then reported the matter to the county government. The county court approved the village militia to send Cui Chenshi's son, Cui Zili, to the county detention center on March 12th and sentenced him to auctioning off a donkey (converted to 246 jin of rice) and twelve large trees (one chi and two cun thick, two zhang and four chi long) (converted to 350 jin of rice). Cui Zili was detained for fifty-five days until the public grain was paid off before he was released.
    Regarding this issue, after two days of investigation and understanding, our opinions are as follows:
    First, Cui Chenshi's complaint to the People's Daily about the government detaining people and cutting down trees is the right thing to do. The criticism in the newspaper has made us realize the serious shortcomings in our work, which is the style of coercion and commandism. Overcoming this shortcoming will strengthen the connection between the government and the people. We welcome this kind of criticism.
    Second, because Cui Chenshi delayed paying public grain, the county government did detain her son for more than fifty days and notified the district government and the village government to auction off her donkey and trees to offset the public grain. When sawing the trees, her daughter-in-law blocked them from sawing, and the village cadres pulled her home, without hitting her. Twelve large trees were sawed, not forty or fifty small trees. The donkey belongs to the Cui family and is raised in her daughter-in-law's mother's home. But in any case, we cannot deny the serious commandism style of our cadres.
    Third, the Huairou County District Government's handling of this issue was very hasty. They were only afraid that Cui Chenshi's delay in paying public grain would affect others' payment. Therefore, serious commandism and bureaucratic and undesirable styles occurred in the work. There was a lack of ideological education for the masses in peacetime, and no enthusiasm for paying public grain was inspired. The county government's instruction to the village to forcibly sell Cui Chenshi's trees and donkeys was wrong. We have criticized the Huairou County District cadres.
    Fourth, Cui Chenshi still has the ability to bear the burden of public grain but attempted to delay or postpone payment and dissuade others from paying public grain, which is also wrong. This point has been explained to the masses. At the same time, Cui Chenshi was criticized, and the majority of farmers were educated. The trees and livestock should be returned to Cui Chenshi, but the public grain she should pay must also be paid.
    Fifth, now that the wheat levy is approaching, we must learn from the lessons of this incident, thoroughly implement the burden policy, implement the State Council's instructions on summer levy work, and prevent the recurrence of coercive commandism.
   Tong County Commissioner's Office
    Editor's Note: After Cui Chenshi personally came to this newspaper to complain, we sent people to the local area to investigate. After receiving the reply from the Tong County Commissioner's Office, we sent a special person to investigate again. Based on the investigation results, we believe that the commandism style of the cadres pointed out by the Tong County Commissioner's Office deserves serious attention from the leading organs. It is hoped that the Tong County Commissioner's Office will use this material to educate cadres at all levels, conduct regular and in-depth inspections of work, and correct deviations and errors in work at any time.

### 怀柔耿辛庄扣人砍树事件通县专署报告处理结果

专栏：人民园地

　　怀柔耿辛庄扣人砍树事件通县专署报告处理结果编辑同志：
    五月二十日人民园地所载《怀柔崔陈氏亲来本报诉述当地政府扣人砍树事件，望通县专署从速调查处理》一文，我们阅后，立即派员协同县政府前往该县耿辛庄调查。兹将调查结果与处理情形告诉你们。
    崔陈氏全家五口人，土地三十四亩（土地质量较差）。去年有七亩半地荒芜，十七亩半遭受水灾歉收。崔家现有驴子二头（一头是小驹）。据调查，去年崔陈氏收麦子二石四斗，棒子、豆子、稻子等共计四石，白薯一千五百斤。去年应负担公粮小米五百二十九斤，地方粮一百五十五斤。根据以上情况，崔陈氏是有一定负担能力的。但崔陈氏强调年景不好，企图不交公粮。今年一月二十五日，该村干部向区里反映她不交公粮，区政府曾于二月二十八日传问她不交公粮的理由。当时崔陈氏自认十天交清，但没有执行。区政府遂将此事呈报县府。县法院于三月十二日批准该村民兵将崔陈氏之子崔自立送县扣押，判决拍卖毛驴一头（折米二百四十六斤），大树（一尺二粗，二丈四尺长）十二棵（折米三百五十斤）。崔自立被押五十五天，直至公粮交清才被放出。
    关于这一问题，经过两天调查了解后，我们的意见如下：
    第一，崔陈氏向人民日报申诉政府扣人、砍树事件，这是做得对的。报纸的批评使我们发现自己工作中的严重缺点，那就是强迫命令作风。我们克服了这个缺点，就能够加强政府与人民群众的联系。我们欢迎这种批评。
    第二，因崔陈氏拖交公粮，县府确将她儿子扣押五十多天，并通知区政府和村政府拍卖她的毛驴、树木折交公粮。在锯树时，她儿媳挡着不叫锯，村干部把她拉回家去，并未打她。锯了十二棵大树，并不是四五十棵小树。驴子是崔家的，在她儿媳的娘家养着。但无论如何，我们干部的严重强迫命令作风，是不能否认的。
    第三，怀柔县区政府处理这一问题，是非常草率的。只怕崔陈氏拖交公粮影响他人交粮。因此在工作中发生了严重的强迫命令和官僚主义的恶劣作风。平时对群众缺乏思想教育，没有启发其交公粮的热忱。县府指示该村强卖崔陈氏的树和毛驴，这种作法是错误的。我们已对怀柔县区干部进行了批评。
    第四，崔陈氏尚有负担公粮的能力，而企图拖延不交和缓交，并劝阻别人交纳公粮，这也是错误的。关于这点，已向群众说明。同时，对崔陈氏提出了批评，对广大农民进行了教育。树与牲畜应该退还崔陈氏，但她应纳的公粮也必须缴纳。
    第五，现在麦征即到，我们要接受这一事件的教训，很好地贯彻负担政策，贯彻政务院关于夏征工作的指示，防止强迫命令现象的再次发生。
   通县专署
    编者按：崔陈氏亲来本报申诉以后，我们曾派人到当地调查。我们接到通县专署的复信后，又派专人前去调查。根据调查结果，我们认为通县专署所指出的干部的强迫命令作风，值得领导机关严重注意。希望通县专署运用这个材料教育各级干部，并经常深入检查工作，随时纠正工作中的偏向和错误。
