Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th - Xinhua News Agency Hunan Branch received a letter from the Communist Party of China branch in Shaoshan Village, Xiangtan County, Chairman Mao's hometown – a branch that persisted in underground struggle for more than a decade – representing the people of Shaoshan Village to Chairman Mao. The letter reported on the decade-long struggle of the people of Shaoshan Village and the branch, and the situation after liberation. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Chairman Mao:

    The great "July 1st" is approaching, and we are openly and freely celebrating our Party's birthday. This is the first time in more than a decade. Today, we specially represent the Shaoshan Village – your hometown – branch, to tell you about the struggles over the years and the situation after liberation, as our gift to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the Party's founding!

    The revolutionary seeds of our Shaoshan Village were planted by you personally in 1925. In 1927, although the revolutionary work was once suspended due to the May 21st Incident (May 21st, the Kuomintang reactionaries in Changsha rebelled against the revolution), in 1936, after Comrades Mao Tefu and Mao Yuanyao returned from the Jiangxi Soviet Area and Shanghai, respectively, our Party branch was re-established in Shaoshan through organizing people's night schools, libraries, and primary school education. Our organization grew up in a long and arduous underground struggle. Under long-term reactionary rule, we led the local masses to carry out struggles against donations, taxes, and conscription, persistently adhering to our work and consolidating the Party's organization. On the eve of liberation, our Xiang (Xiangtan, Xiangxiang) Ning (Ningxiang) border area launched a guerrilla war to coordinate with the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. We mobilized more than a hundred young people from Shaoshan to join the guerrillas. The day we had been waiting for for more than twenty years finally arrived, Shaoshan Village was liberated, how happy and joyful we were! We immediately led the local masses to enthusiastically support the front lines.

    Chairman Mao: In addition to supporting the supplies of the large army passing through, we now have more than 10,000 catties of rice and a lot of firewood and grass, etc., to support the front lines. The people of your hometown welcome the army you led with such enthusiasm!

    Dear Chairman Mao: More than ten years of extremely terrifying environment and dark life cannot torment the Communists with lofty ideals and firm beliefs. When the environment was bad, when we thought of you, thought of the responsibilities of the Party and Party members, thought of the great victories and deeds of our Party in the ten years of land revolution, the 25,000-li Long March, and the eight-year War of Resistance, we had unparalleled strength, and difficulties bowed their heads to us one by one. We relied on this strength and belief, and used the mass line and united front work methods that you taught us, and won every struggle. Today we report to you: During this period, our party members have grown from a few people to more than one hundred people, and from our one village, we have restored and developed the party organizations of Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Ningxiang counties. We have never leaked the secrets of the organization or exposed the face of the organization.

    Chairman Mao: After the liberation of Hunan, under the leadership of the superior Party, we led the people of Shaoshan Village and did the following tasks: During the autumn grain requisition last year, our village's quota was 2,193 dan. The farmers of Shaoshan all said: "We are Chairman Mao's hometown, and we must not lag behind!" From the beginning of investigation, evaluation, to storage, it only took two days, and we completed more than 2,227 dan, exceeding the task. In the work of rent reduction and anti-local tyrants, we established farmers' associations and received more than 723 dan of grain and more than 1,000 silver dollars as fruits. In addition to using it to survive the famine, we invested more than 176 dan of grain and more than 40 silver dollars in production. In the spring plowing production, we mobilized all men, women, old and young in the village to participate in the production movement. All 4,411 mu of land in the village were planted on time; we also opened 10,886 square zhang of wasteland and repaired 163 ponds and 32 dams. The opened wasteland plus the reclaimed wasteland totaled 125,210 square zhang, all planted with miscellaneous grains – mainly sweet potatoes. In spring plowing, we applied more fertilizer than in previous years. This place is much better than in previous years, and the autumn harvest must increase production. You will be very happy to hear that. We also run a consumer cooperative. You know that our Shaoshan Village is short of food. Our cooperative often goes to the Xiangxiang Trading Company to buy food to supply farmers who lack food. We also run a lime production cooperative. In addition to supplying fertilizer for spring plowing in this village, we also exchanged more than 30 dan of grain from Xiangxiang. Everyone has the confidence to get through the summer famine. We also lead all the farmers in the village to study in their spare time, learn culture, study policies, and discuss current affairs. Many children have learned many songs of liberation. The women in the village are also organized, and more than 400 people have joined the Democratic Women's Federation. Last winter, they automatically made more than 100 pairs of shoes to comfort the army, which drove the women in the whole area. The whole area contributed more than 1,000 pairs of shoes. In production, they weed, carry manure, and tread the fields, doing everything, and produce together with men, and the family is harmonious. At present, we are working hard to prepare for the land reform this fall.

    Chairman Mao: These are all the happiness you brought to the people of Shaoshan Village. The farmers in the whole village want us to express our warmest thanks to you!

    Dear Chairman Mao: You are from our village, the leader of the Chinese people, and the leader of our Party. It has been more than twenty years since we parted. I think you must still often commemorate your hometown. We tell you: Your hometown is now full of new atmosphere everywhere. In the future, we will work harder according to your instructions to build Shaoshan Village better. Sincerely pay our dear respects!

    Representatives of the CCP Shaoshan Village Branch: Li Xunqi, Mao Tefu, Mao Luosheng, Zhou Lihua, Mao Liangsheng.

　　毛主席故乡韶山村中共支部
    写信给毛主席庆祝“七一”
    报告了韶山村人民和中共支部坚持了十几年的斗争情形和解放后的新气象
    【新华社长沙三十日电】新华社湖南分社接到毛主席故乡湘潭县韶山村的中国共产党支部——一个坚持十几年地下斗争的支部——代表给毛主席的一封信。信中报告了韶山村人民和该支部十几年的斗争和解放后的情况。全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    伟大的“七一”快到了，我们公开地、自由地来欢庆自己党的生日，这还是十几年来破天荒的第一次。今天，我们特代表韶山村——您的故乡——支部，将历年来的斗争和解放后的情况告诉您，作为我们对党成立二十九周年纪念的献礼！
    我们韶山村的革命种子，是您在一九二五年亲自种下的。一九二七年，虽因马日事变（五月二十一日，长沙国民党反动派叛变革命），革命工作一度停顿，但在一九三六年，毛特夫和毛远耀两同志先后从江西苏区和上海回来后，在韶山通过举办民众夜校、图书馆和小学教育等工作，我们党支部又重新建立了。我们的组织，是在长期的艰苦的地下斗争中成长的。在长期反动统治下，我们领导了当地群众进行过抗捐、抗税、反抗征兵的斗争，顽强地坚持工作，巩固了党的组织。在解放前夕，我们湘（湘潭、湘乡）宁（宁乡）边区为策应人民解放军南下，展开了游击战争。我们发动了韶山百余青年参加了游击队。我们盼望了二十几年的日子终于来到了，韶山村解放了，我们多么欢喜多么高兴啊！我们马上又领导了当地群众热烈地支援前线。
    毛主席：我们除了支援过境大军给养外，现在还剩下了一万多斤米和很多柴草等支援前线的物资呢。您的故乡的人民是以这样的热情来欢迎您所领导的军队的！
    亲爱的毛主席：十余年的极端恐怖的环境和黑暗的生活，折磨不了具有崇高理想和必胜信念的共产党员。在环境恶劣的时候，我们一想到您，想到党和党员的责任，想到我党在十年土地革命、二万五千里长征、八年抗战的伟大胜利和事迹，我们就有了无比的力量，困难也就一个一个向我们低头。我们就靠这力量和信念，运用了您教导给我们的群众路线与统一战线的工作方法，赢得了每一个斗争。我们今天报告您：在这期间，我们党员由几个人壮大成一百多人，并且从我们一个村恢复和发展了湘潭、湘乡、宁乡三个县的党的组织。我们一直没有泄漏过组织的秘密，暴露过组织的面貌。
    毛主席：湖南解放后，我们在上级党的领导下领导了韶山村的人民，做了下列几项工作：在去年秋征时，我们村里的配额是二千一百九十三担。韶山农民都说：“我们是毛主席的故乡，绝不能落后！”从开始调查、评议到入库，只有两天功夫，我们就完成了二千二百二十七担多，超过了任务。在减租和反恶霸工作中，我们成立了农民协会，得到了七百二十三担多谷子和一千多块银洋的果实。除用以度荒外，我们以一百七十六担多谷子和四十多块银洋投入了生产。在春耕生产中，我们动员了全村男女老少投入生产运动。全村四千四百一十一亩地，都按时插了秧；还开了一万零八百八十六方丈的荒，修好一百六十三口塘和三十二座坝。已开出的荒地加上熟荒共一十二万五千二百一十方丈，都种上了杂粮——主要是红薯。在春耕中，我们施肥比往年都多。我们这地方今年比往年好多了，秋收一定要增产。您听了一定也很高兴。我们还办了一个消费合作社，您知道我们韶山村是缺粮的，我们合作社便经常到湘乡贸易公司买粮食供应缺粮的农民。我们还办了一个石灰生产合作社，除供应了本村春耕的肥料外，还在湘乡换回谷子三十多担。大家都有信心度过夏荒。我们还领导全村农民在生产之余进行学习，学习文化，研究政策和讨论时事。很多小孩子都学会了许多解放的歌曲。村里的妇女也组织起来了，参加民主妇联的已有四百多人。去年冬天她们自动做了一百多双鞋子劳军，带动了全区妇女，全区共献出鞋子一千多双。在生产中，她们锄草、挑粪、踹田，样样都做，和男子共同生产，一家和睦。目前，我们正在紧张地进行今秋土地改革的准备工作。
    毛主席：这些都是您带给韶山村人民的幸福，全村农民要我们向您致最热烈的感谢！
    亲爱的毛主席：您是我们村里的人，是中国人民的领袖，又是我们党的领袖。一别二十几年了，想您一定还常纪念着您的故乡。我们告诉您：您的故乡，现在到处都是新气象。今后我们还要更好地照着您的指示努力工作，把韶山村建设得更好。谨致亲爱的敬礼！
    中共韶山村支部代表李勋启、毛特夫、毛罗生、周立华、毛亮生。
