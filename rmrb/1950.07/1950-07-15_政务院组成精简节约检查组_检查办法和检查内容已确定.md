　　Xinhua News Agency, July 14th—The State Council's Streamlining and Thrift Inspection Group held its first meeting on the 10th. This group is composed of twelve individuals appointed by the State Council, including Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the People's Supervisory Committee, and heads of various commissions, ministries, and administrations. Liu Jingfan serves as the convener. The task is to inspect the implementation of streamlining and thrift within the State Council and its affiliated commissions, ministries, committees, academies, administrations, and banks. At the first meeting, presided over by Liu Jingfan, it was decided that, according to the State Council's Streamlining and Thrift Inspection Measures, each department should first organize its own Streamlining and Thrift Inspection Working Group. The methods adopted will include the leading cadres taking responsibility for organizing and mobilizing staff, launching criticism and self-criticism, and broadly promoting democracy to ensure thorough and in-depth inspections, thereby achieving the goals of improving work and educating cadres. Simultaneously, the inspection group will dispatch inspection working groups to participate in or review the inspection work of various departments with a focus on key areas. The inspection content will focus on whether the number of staff exceeds the authorized establishment, the qualifications of the staff, their work attitude, and whether the establishment itself meets actual needs. At the same time, it will also inspect whether there are extravagance and waste phenomena in building construction, vehicle use, furniture and equipment, convening meetings, office supplies, and daily expenses, as well as whether expenditure complies with the budget and whether there are instances of corruption and waste. The inspection period is generally set to be completed within one month.
