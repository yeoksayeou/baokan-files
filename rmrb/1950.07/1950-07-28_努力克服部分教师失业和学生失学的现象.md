　　Strive to Overcome the Phenomenon of Partial Teacher Unemployment and Student Dropout
    The "Instruction on Relieving Unemployed Teachers and Handling Student Dropout Problems" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government is an important measure for the restoration and construction of cultural and educational undertakings in our country. People's governments and cultural and educational leading organs in places where teacher unemployment and student dropout exist should earnestly implement this instruction.
    At present, most parts of our country have more or less teacher unemployment and student dropout; in some places, it is quite serious. Among the existing schools, many are struggling to survive under difficult conditions. Generally speaking, the situation is more serious in rural areas than in cities, and private schools are more difficult than public schools. However, in the Northeast and the old liberated areas within the customs, this phenomenon has been gradually eliminated, and the number of schools and students has increased significantly compared with before liberation. The teaching content and teaching methods of school education have also been significantly improved, and the composition of students has also begun to undergo fundamental changes. At the end of 1949, the number of schools in the Northeast increased by 60 percent compared with before liberation, and the number of schools in the five provinces of North China increased by about 50 percent compared with before liberation. In the Northeast and North China, children of the working people account for the majority of all primary and secondary school students. What does this actual situation illustrate? It shows that the current unemployment and dropout problems of some teachers and students in the newly liberated areas are only temporary. As long as land reform is completed and production and construction begin on a new track, the education cause in these areas will develop smoothly, and the phenomenon of teacher unemployment and student dropout will gradually disappear.
    The reasons why the problems of teacher and student unemployment and dropout are more serious in the newly liberated areas are mainly due to the following reasons:
    First, this phenomenon already existed seriously before liberation, which was one of the evils of the Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term rule. At that time, the national economy was increasingly bankrupt, the masses of the people were increasingly impoverished, school education existed in name only, and the inconsistency between learning and application was bound to cause this evil result. Due to the limitations of various conditions, it was impossible to eliminate this phenomenon in a short period of time in areas that had just been liberated. According to statistics from the Subei area, more than 20,000 unemployed intellectuals were dealt with at the beginning of the liberation of the area. Some were absorbed into the Southwest Military Service Corps, some were sent to work in the Northeast, and some entered military and political universities or cadre schools to study. However, there were still 20,000 to 30,000 unemployed intellectuals left in the area, which shows how serious the phenomenon of unemployment and dropout was during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries!
    Second, the Kuomintang reactionaries did everything possible to destroy and ravage schools during the war. In the front and rear, many schools were destroyed and persecuted. Under the threat of bandit planes, bandit agents, and blacklists, countless teachers and students were forced to flee. In the Subei and Wanbei areas of East China, the Kuomintang bandit army deliberately destroyed many school buildings and facilities, forcing teachers and students to flee. For example, Hefei in Wanbei had the Kuomintang puppet government that fled from the three provinces of North China and more than a dozen secondary schools that fled from North China before liberation. When Jiangbei was liberated, the Kuomintang reactionaries moved a large number of schools from Wanbei and Subei to Jiangnan. According to incomplete statistics, after the liberation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, more than 15 secondary schools were sent back from the Subei area alone. After the liberation of Jiangnan's Sunan and Zhejiang areas, there were not only schools that fled from Jiangbei, but also schools that fled from the Northeast and North China. Until now, there are still schools that have not been completely sent back in the Sunan area. These schools have no school buildings or facilities, and no fixed learning system, which is actually equivalent to a refugee group; but in the Kuomintang's archives, they are all called "regular schools." In addition, a large number of unemployed young intellectuals used nominal occupations to cover themselves in order to avoid the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription, but in reality, they were still unemployed. These situations show that a considerable part of the large number of unemployed and out-of-school intellectuals in some areas are created by the reactionaries during the war. After the liberation of mainland China, the blockade and bombing by the US imperialists and the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs also temporarily increased our difficulties in restoration and construction.
    Third, in the social and economic changes after liberation and in the mass movements of anti-despotism, rent reduction, and preparation for land reform in the countryside, the peasants gradually turned over, and the feudal forces collapsed rapidly; the landlords and bureaucrats who had previously funded some private schools successively fled or stopped funding, so that the boards of directors of some private schools were in a state of stagnation. Some children of landlords left school either because of class prejudice against the revolution or because of changes in their family's economic situation. Young students with a higher level of awareness have joined revolutionary cadre schools to study or participated in the work of revolutionary troops and organs. However, because land reform has not yet been carried out or has only been carried out recently, most peasant children are temporarily unable to attend school. Under such circumstances, some schools had to be closed. In the cities, due to the rational reorganization of the economy and the enemy's blockade and bombing, industry and commerce encountered temporary difficulties, which directly and indirectly affected the lives of citizens of all classes, and naturally affected the economy of general schools. In addition, some schools themselves were poorly managed, making it more difficult to maintain themselves in the new environment.
    Fourth, serious disasters occurred in some areas. Because water conservancy was in disrepair for a long time before the war, the bandit army destroyed it madly during the war, and there was no time to repair all the water conservancy after the war. Serious floods occurred in some areas of Subei and Wanbei in East China, and Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in Central and Southern China. The situation of schools in the disaster areas is of course very difficult. Some primary and secondary schools have been able to maintain themselves by uniting and helping each other between teachers and students, producing and saving, and overcoming difficulties; but many schools have been closed.
    These all show that the phenomenon of unemployment and dropout is caused by long-term historical reasons, and that the current situation is only temporary, and it will be overcome by the completion of land reform and the development of urban and rural production and construction.
    However, as far as the current situation is concerned, this phenomenon of unemployment and dropout cannot be ignored and must be vigorously overcome. In fact, governments at all levels have made many efforts to overcome this phenomenon under difficult material conditions. According to recent investigation reports, the general local education administrative organs have earnestly adopted various practical methods in accordance with the central government's policy of "maintaining schools and gradually transforming them." For example, recruiting unemployed teachers for short-term training; recruiting unemployed intellectuals and out-of-school youths by various troops and cadre schools and assigning them jobs after training; helping private schools solve economic difficulties through democratic consultations among teachers, students, parents, and workers, or directly giving subsidies to enable schools to maintain themselves as much as possible; calling on teachers and students to unite, be frugal, and tide over difficulties together; and helping solve the problem of unemployment and dropout of teachers and students after the closure of schools. These measures have generally achieved remarkable results. Some places have reduced the phenomenon of intellectual unemployment and dropout, and some places have prevented the expansion of this phenomenon. However, there are also individual areas that do not pay enough attention to this issue, or do not handle it in a timely manner, or do not handle it properly. Some cadres do not have enough understanding of the important policy of our party and the people's government to cultivate, unite, and transform intellectuals and the correct policy of "maintaining schools and gradually transforming them," thus aggravating the problem of intellectual unemployment and dropout. This should be corrected in a timely manner.
    In order to correctly implement the instructions issued by the State Council this time, the educational organs in various places should first deeply recognize the importance of "taking into account both public and private" in their leading ideology. Overcome the past biases of some cadres in some areas who neglected private schools. The number of existing public and private schools is really too small compared with the needs of the Chinese people. It is not enough to rely solely on public schools to meet the educational requirements of the people. We should help private schools solve difficulties and reform school administration in a planned manner under the principle of overall consideration, so that they can maintain themselves as much as possible. However, we should not hold a simple view of relying on subsidies and relief. We should closely combine the work of subsidies and relief with the important work of education for employed and unemployed teachers and other intellectuals, and help them strengthen their studies and improve their ideological and professional levels. Make them eliminate doubts, broaden their horizons, clearly understand the nature of the current difficulties, and look forward to the glorious prospects of the cultural and educational construction upsurge. We should link the solution of the problem of teacher unemployment with the problem of training teachers. On a national scale, the current general teachers, especially the teachers with high quality and suitable for the needs of new education, are very lacking, and are not enough to cope with the needs of future development. Improving the ideological level, cultural level, and professional level of existing unemployed teachers is one of the ways to solve this problem.
    For the unemployed teachers and out-of-school youths in the newly liberated areas who are experiencing temporary difficulties, it is of paramount importance to intensify the study of policies, pay attention to domestic and foreign affairs, understand the nature of the current difficulties, and always maintain ideological clarity and emotional health in difficult situations. Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government attach so much importance to and care for all patriotic intellectuals, and the revolution and construction of the new China need talents in all fields so much. Teachers and students have many ways out. Since liberation, the general teachers and students, especially the teachers and students in the disaster areas, have demonstrated the excellent qualities of the children of the new China and displayed the noble spirit of selflessness. Some teachers have even made touching deeds that are worthy of praise. However, some teachers and students have not yet truly established the idea of serving the people anytime and anywhere, and more or less maintain old habits that are not suitable for the new era; they pay attention to personal status, inappropriately emphasize personal interests, and are unwilling to go to the masses, especially unwilling to go to the countryside, and are nostalgic for urban life and personal small world. These shortcomings in thinking habits hinder them from being closely linked with the reality of the new China and the masses, and limit their spiritual, work, and life prospects, which should be overcome.
    The world is advancing, and China is advancing. The wheel of historical progress will shatter all difficulties. The current difficulties of partial teacher unemployment and student dropout can be completely solved. It is hoped that all parties concerned will work together in accordance with the instructions of the State Council.

### 努力克服部分教师失业和学生失学的现象

　　努力克服部分教师失业和学生失学的现象
    中央人民政府政务院发布“关于救济失业教师与处理学生失学问题的指示”，是对于目前我国文化教育事业的恢复与建设上的一项重要措施。凡在存在有教师失业和学生失学的地方，人民政府和文化教育的领导机关都应当认真地执行这个指示。
    目前我国大部分地区或多或少地存在着教师失业和学生失学的现象；在某些地方还相当严重。而在现存的学校中，也有不少是在困难的情况下勉强维持着的。一般说来，乡村较城市严重；私立学校比公立学校困难。但在东北，在关内的老解放区，却已经逐步消除了这种现象，而且学校和学生的数量都比解放前增加了很多。学校教育的教学内容和教学方法也都有了显著的改进，学生成份也开始有了根本的变化。东北的学校数量在一九四九年底即比解放前增加了百分之六十，华北五省的学校比解放前增加了百分之五十左右。在东北和华北，劳动人民的子女在全体中小学生中已占大多数。这种实际情形说明了什么呢？它说明了：当前新解放区部分教师学生的失业失学问题，只是暂时性的问题。只要完成了土地改革，生产建设开始走上了新的轨道，这些地区的教育事业就会顺利发展起来，而教师失业、学生失学的现象就会跟着逐步消灭。
    教师、学生的失业失学问题在新解放区所以会表现得比较严重，主要是由于以下几个原因：
    第一，这种现象在解放以前已严重存在，这是国民党反动派长期统治的恶果之一。当时国民经济日益破产，人民大众日益贫困，学校教育有名无实，学与用的不一致等等，就必然会造成这个恶果。而解放不久的地区，由于各种条件的限制，一时不可能消灭此种现象。据苏北地区的统计材料，该区解放之初，即处理了原有失业知识分子两万人以上，有些被吸收到西南随军服务团里，有些被派到东北去工作，有些进了军政大学或干部学校学习。但该区留下的原有失业知识分子仍有二万到三万之多，可见国民党反动派统治时期失业失学的现象是何等严重！
    第二，国民党反动派在战争时期对于学校的破坏摧残，无所不用其极。在前方和后方，许多学校受到摧毁和迫害。在匪机、匪特、黑名单等威胁下，无数师生被迫逃亡。在华东的苏北、皖北地区，国民党匪军有意破坏了许多学校的校舍和校具，迫使学校师生流亡。例如皖北合肥，解放前曾有华北三省的流亡伪政府和华北十几个中等以上的流亡学校。江北解放时，国民党反动派又把皖北、苏北大批学校搬到江南去。据不完全的统计，江浙解放后，仅苏北区被遣送回来的，就有十五个以上的中等学校。江南的苏南、浙江地区，解放后不但有江北的流亡学校，而且有东北和华北的流亡学校。苏南区直到现在还有未遣送完毕的流亡学校。这些学校没有校舍校具，没有固定的学习制度，实际上等于难民团；但在国民党的档案中，都被称为“正规学校”。此外，大量失业青年知识分子为了躲避国民党反动派拉夫抓丁，都用名义上的职业来掩护自己，实际上仍是失业者。这些情况说明了当前某些地区失业失学的知识分子的庞大数字中，有相当大的一部分都是反动派在战争时期制造出来的。我国大陆解放后，美帝国主义和国民党匪帮残余的封锁与轰炸，也还暂时增加了我们恢复与建设的困难。
    第三，解放后社会经济的变革和在乡村中反霸、减租、准备土地改革等群众运动中，农民逐渐翻身，封建势力迅速崩溃；原先资助某些私立学校的大地主和官僚相继逃匿或停止资助，以致有些私立学校的校董会陷于停顿。一部分地主子弟或因对革命抱有阶级成见，或因家庭经济状况变化而离开了学校。觉悟程度较高的青年学生纷纷考入革命干部学校学习或参加革命部队和机关的工作。而农民子弟又因土地改革尚未进行或进行不久，大都暂时无力入学。在此种情况下，有些学校就不得不停办了。在城市，由于经济的合理改组和敌人的封锁轰炸，工商业碰到了暂时的困难，直接间接影响了各阶层市民的生活，自然也影响了一般学校的经济。再加有些学校本身办理不良，更难在新环境里维持下去。
    第四，某些地区发生严重的灾荒。因为战前水利长期失修，战时匪军疯狂破坏，战后又来不及修整全部水利。华东区的苏北和皖北，中南区的河南、两湖、江西等部分地区，都发生了严重的水灾。灾区学校的处境当然是十分困难的。有些中小学由于师生团结互助，生产节约，克服困难，得以维持下去；但不少学校却停顿了。
    这些都说明了失业失学的现象是长期历史原因所造成，而目前乃是暂时的现象，它将被土地改革的完成和城乡生产建设的开展所克服。
    然而就目前的情况说，这种失业失学现象是不容忽视的，必须大力加以克服。实际上，各级人民政府在困难的物质条件下，为克服这种现象已经做了不少的努力。根据最近的调查报告，一般地方教育行政机关都认真根据中央“维持学校，逐步改造”的方针，采取了各种各样的实际办法。如招收失业教师进行短期训练；由各部队及干部学校招收失业知识分子和失学青年加以训练后分配工作；帮助私立学校以师生、家长、工友民主协商的方法解决经济困难，或直接给以补助，使学校尽可能维持下去；号召师生团结，精打细算，共度难关；帮助解决学校停办后的师生失业失学问题。这些措施普遍取得了显著的成绩，有些地方减少了知识分子失业失学现象，有些地方制止了这种现象的扩大。但也有个别地区对这一问题重视不够，或者处理得不及时，或者处理得不适当，有些干部对我党和人民政府培养、团结、改造知识分子的重要政策和“维持学校，逐步改造”的正确方针，认识不够，因而使知识分子失业失学问题严重化。这就应该及时加以纠正。
    为了正确执行这次政务院所发布的指示，各地教育机关在领导思想上首先应该深刻认识“公私兼顾”的重要性。克服过去某些地区某些干部忽视私立学校的偏向。现有公私立学校的数量和中国人民的需要比较起来，实在是太少了。只靠公立学校是不够满足人民教育的要求的。应该在统筹兼顾的原则下有计划地帮助私立学校解决困难，改革校政，使其尽可能维持下去。但是也不应该抱着单纯的依赖补助与救济的观点，应把补助救济工作与教育在业和失业教职员及其他知识分子的重要工作紧密结合起来，帮助他们加强学习，提高其思想水平和业务水平。使他们消除疑虑，放开眼界，明确认识目前困难的性质，望见文教建设高潮的光辉远景。我们应该把解决教师失业问题与训练师资问题联系起来。就全国范围说，目前一般师资，尤其是质量较高、适合新教育需要的师资，是十分缺乏的，更不足以应付将来发展的需要。把现有失业教师的思想水平、文化水平和业务水平加以提高，正是解决这个问题的方法之一。
    对于新解放区一般遭遇暂时困难的失业教师和失学青年来说，加紧学习政策、关心国内外大事，认识目前困难的性质，在困难处境中经常保持思想的清醒和情绪的健康，这是头等重要的事情。毛主席、共产党和人民政府是那样重视和关心一切爱国的知识分子，新中国的革命和建设事业是那样需要各方面的人才，教师和学生们的出路是很多的。解放以来，一般教师和学生，尤其是灾区的教师和学生，表现了新中国儿女的优良品质，发挥了公而忘私的高尚精神，有些教师还做出了可歌可泣的动人事迹，这都是值得表扬的。但是也有部分教师和学生还没有真正确立随时随地为人民服务的思想，或多或少地保持不适合于新时代的旧习气；讲究个人地位，不适当地强调个人兴趣，不愿意到群众中去，特别是不愿意到农村中去，留恋城市生活和个人的小天地。这些思想习惯上的缺点，阻碍了他们与新中国的实际和群众的血肉相联系，限制了他们精神上、工作上和生活上的出路，这是应该加以克服的。
    世界在前进，中国在前进。历史进步的车轮将粉碎一切困难。目前部分教师失业和学生失学的困难是完全可以解决的，希望有关各方按照政务院的指示共同努力。
