Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" The combined issue No. 40 and 41 (total Nos. 79 and 80) of the Chinese edition has been published.

The editorial of Issue No. 40 (total No. 79) is entitled "The Lessons of World War II and the Struggle for Peace." The article states: World War II has definitively proven that it is impossible for imperialists to destroy the progressive socialist system that frees people from exploitation and national oppression. The lessons of World War II educate all people to fight more bravely and resolutely for true democracy and for socialism. Only democracy and socialism can enable the people to eliminate exploitation and war once and for all, and can ensure the independence and freedom of all nationalities. The article states: Only in the insane minds of those imperialist aggressors who have completely lost their minds could the idea of seeking world hegemony arise again after the lessons of World War II. The people of the world once buried such schemes in the ruins of Hitler's empire. Under the current conditions, when the balance of power has undergone fundamental changes and is even more favorable to socialism, there is even more reason to say that the new aspirants for world hegemony have no possibility of realizing their adventurous plans. No atomic weapons, no "total diplomacy" can defeat the people's high level of awareness, can defeat their perseverance and courage in fighting for their national independence and national sovereignty, can defeat their firm determination to decide their own destiny! The undeniable lessons of World War II clearly show that what the new aspirants for world hegemony can expect is not world hegemony, but the people's judgment and the gallows.

The editorial of Issue No. 41 (total No. 80) is entitled "The Struggle of the People of Colonies and Dependent Countries Against the Warmongers." The article points out that the scale of national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries is expanding and becoming more and more organized. The struggle of the people of colonies and dependent countries against imperialist oppressors is an important part of the common struggle of the working people of the world against the Anglo-American new war instigators and for peace and democracy. The success of national liberation movements strengthens the world peace front. The victory of the national liberation struggle in the East is also the victory of the peace and democracy front. The article points out that one of the most devastating blows to the imperialist system since the October Revolution was the blow given by the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. Under the current circumstances, as the Chinese experience has proven, armed resistance to imperialist plunderers is the most effective form of national liberation movement in colonial countries. It seriously weakens imperialism, and in so doing, strengthens the peace front.

Issue No. 40 published an article by Grotewohl, Chairman of the German Socialist Unity Party, entitled "The Treachery of the German Social Democratic Party," which exposed the counter-revolutionary faces of German Social Democratic leaders such as Schumacher and Ollenhauer who serve Anglo-American imperialism. The article states: The Social Democratic leaders have almost all resided in Britain or the United States, and while residing there, they served Anglo-American imperialism, and after 1945, they returned to Germany as direct agents of Anglo-American intelligence agencies. As a result, the Social Democratic leaders not only continued to deceive the broad masses of the working people, but even began to organize a spy network. The article states: The attitude of Schumacher and Ollenhauer and their ilk shows that the unity of the German workers' movement cannot be realized by an alliance with the heads of the right-wing Social Democratic Party. This unity can only be achieved by carrying out a resolute struggle against them. Schumacher and his group are pursuing an anti-people policy of splitting the working class. They are the main enemies of the unity of the working class and the most dangerous allies of the imperialist warmongers. The extent to which their sabotage activities will be defeated will be determined by the united struggle of the working people of West Germany and West Berlin against them.

An article written by Buck, General Secretary of the Progressive Workers' Party of Canada, entitled "Canada in the Aggressive Plans of US Imperialism," exposed the situation of US aggression against Canada, saying: The United States is trying to turn Canada into its military base. Canada's relationship with the United States is currently that of an occupied country. The Canadian government is trying hard to turn Canada into a subordinate organization supplying raw materials for US monopoly industries, especially the US war industry. This policy of the Canadian government has caused a crisis in some major export-dependent economic sectors in Canada and has contributed to massive unemployment. The article states: In Canada, the struggle for peace is directly related to maintaining Canada's independence, preventing the occupation of Canada by US imperialism, opposing the aggressive Atlantic Pact and the Marshall Plan, declaring the atomic bomb illegal, and striving for disarmament. The Progressive Workers' Party is actively fighting for peace.

An article by Duna, a member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party, entitled "The Preliminary Achievements of the Hungarian Cooperative Movement," introduced Hungary's experience in establishing agricultural production cooperatives and promoting agricultural collectivization.

In addition, Issue No. 41 published an article by Lazarov, Minister of Finance of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, entitled "The Financial and Budgetary Policy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria," which introduced Bulgaria's experience in budgeting, taxation, and the financial system.

### “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”  中文版第四十、四十一期合刊介绍

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第四十、四十一期合刊介绍
    【新华社十日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第四十、第四十一期合刊（总第七十九第八十期）已经出版了。
    第四十期（总第七十九期）社论题为：“二次世界大战的教训与争取和平的斗争”。该文说：二次世界大战确凿地证明了：帝国主义者想摧毁那种使人民摆脱剥削和民族压迫的进步的社会主义制度是不可能的。二次世界大战的教训，教育着一切人民要更勇敢和更坚决地为真正民主、为社会主义而斗争。只有民主和社会主义，才能使人民一劳永逸地消灭剥削和战争，才能确保各族人民的独立和自由。该文说：只有在那些已完全失去理性的帝国主义侵略者的疯狂头脑中，才能够在二次世界大战的教训之后，又起了图谋世界霸权的念头。全世界的人民，过去曾经一度把这样的图谋，埋葬在希特勒帝国的废墟之中。在当前的条件下，当力量的对比已发生了根本的变化，而对社会主义更有利的时候，则更有理由来说，世界霸权的新渴求者是没有任何可能来实现他们的冒险计划的。没有任何原子武器、没有任何“总体外交”能战胜人民的高度自觉，能战胜他们为争取他们的民族独立和民族主权而斗争的坚忍与勇气，能战胜他们要决定自己命运的坚强决心的！二次世界大战的无容置辩的教训清清楚楚说明了：世界霸权的新渴求者可以期望得到的，不是什么世界霸权，而是人民的裁判和绞架。
    第四十一期（总第八十期）社论题为：“殖民地与附属国人民反对战争贩子的斗争”。该文指出：殖民地与附属国中的民族解放运动的规模正日益扩大，并且越来越有组织性。殖民地与附属国人民反对帝国主义压迫者的斗争，乃是全世界劳动人民反对英美新战争挑拨者与争取和平民主的共同斗争的重要部分。民族解放运动的成功加强着世界和平阵线。东方民族解放斗争的胜利，也是和平与民主阵线的胜利。该文指出：从十月革命以来对帝国主义制度最具毁灭性的打击之一，便是中国人民革命胜利所给的打击。在目前情况下，如同中国的经验所证明的，向帝国主义掠夺者进行武装抵抗，乃是殖民地国家中民族解放运动最有效的形式。它严重地削弱帝国主义，并且这样做的时候，便在加强着和平阵线。
    第四十期登载了德国统一社会党主席格罗提渥的《德国社会民主党的悖逆》一文，揭露了德国社会民主党领袖们如舒马赫之流与奥伦豪尔之流为英美帝国主义效劳的反革命面貌。该文说：社会民主党领袖们差不多都在英国或美国侨居过，在侨居时他们都为英美帝国主义效劳过，而在一九四五年以后，则作为英美情报机关的直接代理人回到德国来。结果，社会民主党的领袖们不仅继续欺骗广大的劳动人民群众，而且竟开始组织一个间谍网了。该文说：舒马赫和奥伦豪尔之流的态度表明：德国工人运动的统一是不能由和右翼社会民主党的头子们的联盟来实现的。只有和他们进行坚决的斗争，这个统一才能实现。舒马赫和他的集团正奉行着一个分裂工人阶级的反人民政策。他们是工人阶级统一的主要敌人，是帝国主义战争贩子的最危险的同盟者。他们的破坏活动会被击败到什么程度，这将由西德和西柏林的劳动人民团结一致，共同向他们进行斗争的情形来决定。
    加拿大进步工人党总书记勃克所写《美帝侵略计划中的加拿大》一文揭露美国侵略加拿大的情形说：美国力图把加拿大变为它的军事基地。加拿大对美国的关系，目前就是一个被占领国的关系。加拿大政府则亟力图谋把加拿大变成美国垄断工业，特别是美国战争工业的供给原料的附属机构。加拿大政府的这一政策，使加拿大某些主要依赖输出的经济部门发生危机，并且促成了大规模失业。该文说：在加拿大，争取和平的斗争直接牵涉到维持加拿大的独立、制止美帝国主义对加拿大的占领、反对侵略性的大西洋公约和马歇尔计划、宣布原子弹非法和争取裁减军备的斗争。进步工人党正在为着争取和平而积极奋斗。
    匈牙利工人党中央委员杜那的《匈牙利合作运动的初步成就》一文，介绍了匈牙利在建立农业生产合作社和促进农业集体化的经验。
    此外，第四十一期刊载保加利亚人民共和国财政部长拉查罗夫的《保加利亚人民共和国的财政与预算政策》一文，介绍了保加利亚在预算、税收及金融体制方面的经验。
