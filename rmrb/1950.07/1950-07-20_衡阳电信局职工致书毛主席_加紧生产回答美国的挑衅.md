　　Letter from Employees of Hengyang Telecommunications Bureau to Chairman Mao
    Intensify Production to Respond to American Provocations
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the more than two hundred employees of the Hengyang Telecommunications Bureau, were suffering the most severe oppression from the Chiang-Bai bandit gang last winter. At that time, the bandit Bai Chongxi lived in Hengyang and sent special agents, officers and soldiers to guard the telegraph and telephone rooms and machine rooms every day to monitor us. We had no freedom at all. However, we were looking forward to the early southward advance of the People's Liberation Army. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, before the liberation of Hengyang, the bandit gang panicked and scurried around the streets. In the end, they did not hesitate to use the most despicable means to loot and destroy the people's property. At this time, all the employees of our bureau waged a tenacious struggle to protect the bureau from the bandits, preserving most of the machinery, so that communication work was restored within a few days after liberation. At that time, we greeted the liberation with the highest enthusiasm.
    We clearly realize that without you and the Chinese Communist Party, we workers would never be able to turn over a new leaf. In order to welcome the "July 1st" Party's birthday, our bureau launched a production competition as early as May. The employees displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, striving to seize the red flag on "July 1st." Through this movement, our work has made great achievements, constantly creating new records. The employees worked hard to overcome errors and delays, and the telegraph error rate was reduced to 0.73 per thousand. In terms of machinery and lines: due to the employees' strengthening of their sense of responsibility as masters, and the implementation of safety measures, the number of obstacles has been greatly reduced, and some units have not even had a single problem in two months. The workers often put forward rationalization proposals to improve technology. Some machine parts that could not be matched before, the workers came up with ways to match them themselves under the existing technology and equipment conditions. We use this practical work to congratulate the birthday of the Party led by you.
    Recently, the American imperialist war-monger Truman issued a arrogant declaration of challenge, sending troops to interfere in Korean internal affairs and prevent our army from liberating Taiwan. This shameless act of provocation has aroused the infinite resentment of all the employees of our bureau. We resolutely support your call and Premier Zhou's statement, continue to carry forward the spirit of the Red May production competition, intensify our work, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and all the territories belonging to the Chinese people. Now, all our employees have signed the peace declaration, and are promoting this movement to the families of employees and other people, mobilizing all peace-loving forces to demonstrate to the imperialists. Let the imperialist war-mongers tremble before us!
    Wishing you good health!

                                    All Employees of Hengyang Telecommunications Bureau

　　衡阳电信局职工致书毛主席
    加紧生产回答美国的挑衅敬爱的毛主席：
    我们衡阳电信局二百多个职工，在去年的冬天，正是受着蒋白匪帮压迫得最厉害的时候。那时白匪崇禧住在衡阳，派了特务军官和匪兵天天守在报话房、机房里监视着我们，我们没有一点自由。可是，我们却在盼望着解放军早日南进。去年中秋节前后，在衡阳解放之前，匪帮慌做一团，满街乱窜，最后还不惜用最卑鄙的手段，进行抢夺和破坏人民的财产。我们全局职工就在这时与匪帮们作了顽强的护局斗争，保全了大部分机器，所以在解放后几天内就恢复了通信工作。当时我们是以最高的热忱来迎接着解放的。
    我们清楚的认识到：没有您和中国共产党，我们工人是永远得不到翻身的。为了迎接“七一”党的生日，我们局里早在五月间就掀起了生产竞赛的热潮。职工们发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，争取在“七一”抢红旗。经过这个运动，我们的工作有了很大的成绩，不断创造出新的纪录。职工们为克服差错稽延现象而努力工作，电报差错比率降低到千分之零点七三。机线方面：由于职工们加强了主人翁的责任感，进行了安全措施，使障碍发生次数大大减少，有的单位甚至在两个月内没有出过一次毛病。工人们经常提出合理化建议，改良技术，一部分以前不能配制的机器零件，在现有的技术和设备条件下，工人们想出了办法自己配制。我们用这些实际的工作来祝贺您所领导的党的生日。
    最近美帝战争贩子杜鲁门发表了狂妄的挑战声明，派遣军队干涉朝鲜内政和阻止我军解放台湾。这种无耻的挑衅行为，激起了我局全体职工无比的愤恨。我们坚决拥护您的号召和周总理的声明，继续发扬红五月生产竞赛的精神，加紧工作，支援人民解放军解放台湾和所有属于中国人民的领土。现在，我们全体职工都在和平宣言书上签了名，并且正在把这个运动推广到职工眷属和其他人民里去，把一切爱好和平的力量动员起来，向帝国主义者示威。让帝国主义的战争贩子们在我们面前发抖吧！祝您身体健康！
                                    衡阳电信局全体职工
