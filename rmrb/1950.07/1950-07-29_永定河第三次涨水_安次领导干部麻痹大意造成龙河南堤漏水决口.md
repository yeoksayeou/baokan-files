　　Yongding River's Third Flood
　　Anci Leading Cadres' Negligence Caused a Breach in the Longhe South Embankment
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Longhe South Embankment in Anci County, Hebei Province, breached near Nanhancun at 3:00 AM on the 20th of this month, inundating nearly ten thousand mu of land. On the 18th, the Yongding River experienced its third flood, with the water level at Lugouqiao reaching 63.52 meters at one point. At 9:00 AM on the 18th, the Humaian (protecting wheat embankment) at Cui Zhuiying in Gu'an overflowed northward, with the main current rushing straight towards Dagu Ying, flowing eastward along the Longhe South Embankment. Leaks were successively discovered in multiple locations from Nangezhuang to Yuchangwu embankment sections, and immediate efforts were made to plug them. At 3:00 AM on the 20th, a leak was discovered east of Nanhancun. Although attempts were made to plug it, they were unsuccessful due to a lack of experience, insufficient materials, and failure to sound the gong to gather the masses, resulting in a breach. The opening was 25 meters wide, with a flow rate of 30 cubic meters per second, inundating nearly ten thousand mu of land. The water flowed safely downstream along the Longhe River, passing under Bridge No. 40 at the Luofa Station on the Beijing-Nanjing Railway.
　　The reasons for this breach, in addition to the lack of experience among flood prevention personnel, were primarily due to negligence in flood prevention work in Anci County. During the first two floods of the Yongding River, this section of the embankment did not experience any water reaching the top, leading the county leadership to focus solely on dangerous sections in the downstream flood zone of Zhangjiawu and other areas. They neither inspected this section of the embankment nor maintained vigilance in its defense, and they also failed to prepare materials for emergency repairs. Secondly, they failed to pay attention to monitoring water conditions, and communication between upstream and downstream areas was not close. After the small embankment at Cui Zhuiying was overtopped, the various downstream locations were unaware. At the same time, most of this embankment section was sandy and not strong enough. Upon learning of this, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government immediately dispatched technical cadres to assist in plugging the breach. On the 21st, Vice Minister Li Baohua, accompanied by Deputy Director Hao Zhizhai of the General Office and Director Liu Zhongrui of the Engineering Department, personally went to the Nanhancun embankment section to investigate. The North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau and the Hebei Provincial Flood Prevention Headquarters both decided to transfer cadres to assist in the work. Starting on the 23rd, after more than 2,700 people actively worked on plugging the breach, it was completely repaired by the afternoon of the 25th. Currently, work is underway to reinforce the thin sections of the embankment near Xiaying above the breach, and it is expected to be completed in the next three or four days.

　　Editor's Note: The Longhe South Embankment extends east from Nanzhuang Village in Gu'an County to west of Yuchangwu Village in Anci County, connecting with the An (ci) Lang (fang) highway. It is a newly constructed embankment section this year, with the main purpose of reducing the flood zone downstream of Lianggezhuang on the Yongding River and protecting the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway. Fortunately, the Yongding River's water volume did not continue to increase, so it did not affect traffic on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway. Furthermore, the Longhe River is a rainwater river between the Yongding River and the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway, and its downstream flows through Bridge No. 40 at Luofa Station, entering the North Canal to the northeast.

### 永定河第三次涨水  安次领导干部麻痹大意造成龙河南堤漏水决口

　　永定河第三次涨水
    安次领导干部麻痹大意造成龙河南堤漏水决口
    【本报讯】河北安次县龙河南堤于本月二十日晨三时在南汉村附近决口，淹地近万亩。十八日永定河第三次涨水，芦沟桥水位曾一度涨至六三·五二公尺。十八日九时，固安崔指挥营护麦埝向北漫溢，大溜直冲大古营，沿龙河南堤东流，南各庄至鱼常务堤段，先后发现漏洞多处，当即进行抢堵。二十日晨三时南汉村东发现漏洞，虽经抢堵，但因缺乏经验，料不凑手，又未鸣锣集众，致抢堵未成，形成决口。口门二十五公尺，流量三十秒立方公尺，淹地近万亩，水顺龙河经由北宁路落垡车站四十号桥安全下泄。
    此次造成决口的原因，除防汛人员缺乏经验外，主要是由于安次县在防汛工作上存在着麻痹大意。永定河前两次涨水，该堤段均未上水，因之该县领导上只注意了泛区下游张家务等地险工，对此段堤防既未检查，在防守上也很松懈，又没有准备好抢险的物料。其次，对水情亦未注意掌握，上下游的联系不密切，崔指挥营小埝过水后，下游各地均不了解。同时该堤段大部为沙质，不够坚固。中央人民政府水利部得悉后，即派技术干部前往协助抢堵。二十一日，李葆华副部长偕办公厅郝执斋副主任、工务司刘钟瑞司长一行亲往南汉堤段查勘。华北水利工程局及河北省防汛总指挥部均决定抽调干部前往协助工作。从二十三日起，经二千七百余群众积极抢堵，已于二十五日下午全部堵复。现正进行决口以上夏营附近堤身单薄处的培厚工作，预料最近三四天即可完成。

    编者按：龙河南堤从固安南庄村以东起，至安次鱼常务村以西止，与安（次）廊（坊）公路相衔接，为今年新修堤段，主要作用是缩小永定河梁各庄以下的泛区和防护京山铁路。此次幸永定河水量未继续增涨，故未影响京山铁路交通。又龙河为永定河与京山路之间的一条雨水河，其下游流经落垡车站第四十号大桥，向东北入北运河。
