　　Xinhua News Agency and our newspaper's correspondents report from various locations: Universities, middle schools, and elementary schools across the country have begun their summer vacations. Local cultural and educational authorities, the Communist Youth League, and various schools are all systematically organizing students' summer activities.

　　Northeast and North China Students Emphasize Recreational Activities

　　In Northeast and North China, due to the earlier liberation, students have a preliminary foundation of ideological transformation. Their summer life is mainly focused on cultural, recreational, and sports activities. The Northeast People's Government's Department of Culture and Education and the Northeast Work Committee of the Communist Youth League have instructed all regions to select areas with good natural environments to hold summer camps. In addition to conducting appropriate course tutoring and review, special emphasis is placed on sports, including swimming, dancing, singing, mountain climbing, ball games, chess competitions, and specimen collection. In areas where conditions permit, visiting groups and tour groups will be organized to visit industrial areas or rural areas to increase students' practical knowledge. In some areas, labor construction teams will be organized on a voluntary basis to participate in various construction projects. Students returning to the countryside are encouraged to participate in family or rural mutual aid production labor, and to assist rural areas in carrying out social education work, publicizing various policies, and promoting the signature campaign to defend world peace. Primary and secondary school students in Beijing have been organized into five youth academies and sixteen children's parks, and have begun to hold various recreational activities suitable for youth interests, such as thousand-person choirs, dramas, glider performances, film screenings, and district youth lectures (explaining current affairs, policies, science, literature, etc.). Some middle schools are also visiting Qinhuangdao in batches to practice swimming, visit factories and mines, practice shooting, and hold joint celebrations with workers and soldiers. Some primary school students will participate in camping at the Labor People's Cultural Palace. Universities have also set up summer activity organizations to lead students' summer activities. In Tianjin, a summer student cultural and sports work group has been formed and began holding ball game competitions on the 14th. Schools have also set up summer libraries, reading rooms, or clubs.

　　Central South and East China Students Study Land Reform Policies

　　In the Central South and East China regions, large-scale land reform work will be carried out this autumn. In order to meet the needs of this practical situation, the summer activities of students in this region are mainly focused on studying and publicizing land reform policies, and engaging in labor production to help students in difficulty solve the tuition fees for the next semester, while also holding appropriate recreational activities. Jiangxi, Hunan, and other regions will also organize student summer rural work teams or rural service teams to publicize land reform policies to farmers and help the families of martyrs and soldiers and poor farmers to produce. Schools in Shanghai have established production organizations, carried out production mutual assistance, and set up many tutoring classes to supplement school courses, providing tutoring for students with weaker grades. Students in Nanjing will continue to carry out on-campus production labor, hold thematic lectures to explain land reform policies and current affairs issues, and some poor students will participate in the work-for-relief work held by the People's Government to solve the economic difficulties of the next semester.

　　Students in Southwest Provinces Conduct Political Study

　　In the areas of the Southwest provinces that were liberated later, students' summer life focuses on participating in political study and conducting preliminary ideological transformation. Drawing on the experience of Beijing and other places last year, summer schools are held to study the history of social development, New Democracy, land reform policies, current affairs, and so on. Students in Chongqing have established a summer school in Shapingba, a cultural district, divided into university, high school, and junior high school departments. The study time is tentatively set for one and a half months. The summer school also mobilized 200 primary school teachers to specifically study the work of organizing young pioneers, preparing to establish young pioneer teams in various primary schools in the next semester. In addition, summer schools in Chengdu, Guiyang, and Nanchong, Santai, and Suining in northern Sichuan are also being prepared. More than 3,700 graduates from major universities and vocational schools in the Southwest this year will participate in local summer school studies.

　　In addition, students above the third grade of various higher vocational schools will conduct planned summer internships. The summer internship work of students from 16 colleges and universities in North China has begun under the leadership of the Student Internship Steering Committee composed of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the central industrial departments, and major colleges and universities.

　　各地学生展开暑期活动
    【本报讯】综合新华社及本报各地通讯员报导：全国各地大、中、小学已开始放暑假，各地文教机关、青年团与各学校，都在有计划地组织学生的暑期活动。
    东北华北学生着重康乐活动
    在东北和华北各地，由于解放时间较早，学生的思想改造已有初步的基础，学生的暑期生活是以文化、娱乐、体育活动为主。东北人民政府文教部和青年团东北工委会已指示各地，选择自然环境较好的地区举办夏令营。除进行适量的课程补习与复习外，特别提倡运动，将展开游泳、舞蹈、歌咏、爬山、球类、棋类比赛和采集标本等活动。在条件许可的地区，并将组织参观团、旅行团等，分赴工业区或农村访问，以增进学生各种实际知识。部分地区将在学生自愿参加的原则下，组织劳动建设队，参加各项修建工程。返回农村的学生，则提倡参加家庭或农村互助的生产劳动；并协助农村开展社会教育工作，宣传各种政策及推动保卫世界和平签名运动等。北京市中小学生已分区组织五个青年学园和十六个儿童乐园，开始举办各种适合青年兴趣的文娱活动，如千人合唱团、戏剧、滑翔机表演、放映电影和分区的青年讲座（讲解时事、政策、科学、文艺等）。一部分中学并分批赴秦皇岛练习游泳，参观厂矿，打靶，和工人、战士联欢；另有部分小学生则将参加在劳动人民文化宫举办的露营。各大学也已分别组织了暑期活动机构，领导学生暑期活动。在天津市，已组成了暑期学生文化体育工作团，于十四日开始举行球类比赛。各学校也分别设立了暑期图书馆、阅览室或俱乐部等。
    中南华东学生学习土改政策
    在中南区和华东区，今年秋季将进行大规模的土地改革工作。为了配合这种实际情况的需要，该区学生的暑期活动，大部分是以学习与宣传土改政策为主，并从事劳动生产，以帮助有困难的学生解决下学期的学费问题，同时举办适当的文娱活动。江西、湖南等地区，并将组织学生暑期下乡工作队或农村服务队，向农民宣传土改政策，并帮助烈士、军人家属及贫苦农民生产。上海各学校已纷纷成立生产机构，进行生产互助，并设立了许多补助学校课程的补习班，为功课较差的学生进行补习。南京市学生将继续开展校内的生产劳动，并举办专题讲座，讲解土改政策与时事问题，另有部分贫寒学生将参加人民政府举办的以工代赈工作，以解决下学期经济困难。
    西南各省学生进行政治学习
    在西南各省解放较晚的地区，学生暑期生活以参加政治学习，进行初步的思想改造为主，吸取去年北京等地的经验举办暑期学园，学习社会发展史、新民主主义论及土地改革政策、时事等。重庆市学生已在文化区沙坪坝成立了暑期学园，分大学、高中、初中三部。学习时间暂定一个半月。学园中还调集了小学教师二百名，专门学习关于组织少年儿童队的工作，准备下学期在各小学建立少年儿童队。此外，成都、贵阳、和川北的南充、三台、遂宁等地的暑期学园亦正筹备中。西南本届各大、专学校毕业生三千七百余人，均将参加当地暑期学园学习。
