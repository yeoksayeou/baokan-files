To the Editor:

Recently, in the People's Forum, I have often seen letters from revolutionary soldiers, government workers, or the masses criticizing local governments for not reasonably resolving issues related to housing, land, marriage, etc.

Why don't local governments respond quickly? (Of course, many local governments have responded quickly and resolved the problems reasonably.) Although in some cases, higher-level governments may not be able to give readers a specific reply immediately due to not fully understanding the truth of the matter, there are often readers who repeatedly urge a response, but the local governments still ignore them (for example, the land and housing problem of Comrade Liu Zhishan's family in the Political Department of the Artillery of the North China Military Region, as mentioned in the People's Forum on July 2, has been delayed for nearly two years, and the Second District Government of Wuyi County has not yet resolved it). This kind of work attitude is not good.

Comrades working in local governments should pay attention to this type of incident. In particular, leading comrades of counties and districts should respond to requesters or inquirers as quickly as possible. Even if the truth needs to be investigated and understood before it can be resolved, a letter should first be sent to the other party explaining the situation. I hope that the people's governments of counties and districts in various regions, especially the new districts, should handle and respond to the questions raised by the people as quickly as possible, and should not delay or ignore them. Local governments should use this relationship to deeply understand the actual situation of grassroots work and overcome and correct shortcomings in their work. This is also an important method for improving work.

　　各地地方政府对读者问题应迅速答复
    ——读者陈甲铣来信建议编辑同志：
    近来在人民园地上，时常看到革命军人、政府工作人员或群众的来信，批评地方政府没有给他们合理解决房屋、土地、婚姻等问题。
    地方政府为何不很快地就回复呢（当然有很多地方政府很快就回复了，并合理地解决了问题）？虽然有些事情发生后，上级政府可能因不完全明了事实的真相，而不能马上给读者以具体回复；但往往有的读者一再函促，而地方政府尚不理睬（如七月二日人民园地所载华北军区炮兵政治部刘志山同志家里的土地房屋问题，拖延将近两年，而武邑二区政府尚未给他解决，即是一例）。这种工作态度是不好的。
    地方政府的工作同志，对上述这一类事件是应该注意的。尤其是县区领导同志，更应该很快地给请求者或询问者以回复。纵然事实真相尚须进行调查了解，方能解决，亦应先给对方复信，说明情况。我希望各地县区人民政府，尤其是新区，对人民所提问题的处理与回复，应尽可能做到迅速，不要拖延或不理睬。地方政府应通过这种关系去深刻了解下层工作的实际情况，克服并纠正工作中的缺点。这也是改善工作的重要方法。
