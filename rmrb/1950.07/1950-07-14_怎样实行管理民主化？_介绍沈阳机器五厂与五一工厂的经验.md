How to Implement Democratic Management?
Introducing the Experiences of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 5 and May First Factory

According to the experiences of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 5 and May First Factory, implementing democratic management in factories is not only limited to running the Factory Management Committee and the Workers' Representative Conference well, but also to implementing democratic management in all aspects. Therefore, the key to whether democratic management can be implemented lies in whether the thinking of relying on the masses is clarified. Otherwise, democratic management will inevitably become a mere formality. The two factories implemented democratic management from the following aspects:

First, major issues in production management should be discussed with all factory workers and staff. Major issues in production management should not only be discussed by the Factory Management Committee, but also be made known to all factory workers and staff and mobilized for discussion.

(1) Discussion of production plans. For example, before the 15th of each month, the Fifth Machine Tool Plant would first have the standing committee of the Factory Management Committee discuss and approve the production plan for the next month, then send it to each workshop for discussion by production teams. The opinions of everyone would be collected and then the Factory Management Committee would make a final decision, which would be formally announced to the entire factory by the administration. This transforms the administration's production plan into everyone's plan. In this way, the completion of the task is guaranteed.

(2) Production progress, task completion, and difficulties encountered should be reported to the workers regularly. The Fifth Machine Tool Plant stipulates that each workshop report production progress every half month, and each team conducts a review after the report. A full factory Workers' Representative Conference is held once a month, where the factory director gives a report, so that all factory workers and staff regularly understand the production situation and care about the problems in production.

(3) The formulation of various management systems must go through repeated discussions and research from top to bottom and from bottom to top. After the idea has matured, it will be promulgated in writing. Only by absorbing the opinions of the masses can the system be more properly complete and in line with the actual situation. At the same time, employees can also earnestly and responsibly implement it.

(4) Whenever a new movement arrives or there are major policy measures, the principles and policies must be clearly explained to all factory workers and staff, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of the workers and staff, realize the intentions of the leadership, and avoid deviations.

Second, care about the welfare and working conditions of workers and staff, and focus on workers' education.

To rely on workers to run the factory well, it is also necessary to care about the welfare and working conditions of workers and staff, focus on workers' education, and improve the political awareness of workers and staff. Collective welfare undertakings and labor equipment that facilitate production and ensure safety, which are conditional and can be done well, should be actively done well. For example, the May First Factory has established night sanatoriums, canteens, bathhouses, nurseries, libraries, cinemas, cooperatives, and primary schools for employees' children. Last year, the expenditure for employee welfare undertakings was approximately 12,288,864,000 Northeast currency. Therefore, it has solved the employees' concerns about life and they can concentrate on production. In terms of improving the cultural and political level of employees, the first and third departments of the May First Factory have established more formal spare-time schools to make up for culture, technology and politics, and systematically train and improve employees.

Third, hold Factory Management Committee meetings and Workers' Representative Conferences well, truly give play to their role, and do not let them become mere formality.

To hold Factory Management Committee meetings well, first of all, the leadership must attach importance to the Management Committee, think of more ways to give play to the role of the Management Committee. According to the experience of the Fifth Machine Tool Plant, to hold Management Committee meetings well, it is necessary to:

(1) Enable representatives to be fully prepared before the meeting, collect the opinions of the masses and bring them up. Three days before the Management Committee meeting, the factory would send out an outline of the issues to be discussed at the meeting, so that the representatives have sufficient time to collect opinions from the masses. Facts have proved that as long as there is preparation in advance, workers' representatives can put forward many valuable opinions.

(2) The meeting content should not be too much, and discuss one or two central issues each time. With fewer issues, a clear center, opinions are also easy to prepare, and the meeting time is also short. The Standing Committee should also prepare a plan before the meeting, but at the meeting, it should try to encourage workers' representatives to speak first and speak more.

(3) The meeting should make a clear decision and let the representatives take it back. In order to implement the decisions of the meeting to the masses, the Fifth Machine Tool Plant adopted four methods: (1) print and distribute the resolutions of each meeting; (2) the factory department publishes them in the form of announcements; (3) workers' representatives participate in workshop Management Committees to convey them; (4) workers' representatives directly convey them to workers at certain meetings. In short, use various methods to convey the resolution to the workers to strengthen the connection between the leadership and the masses.

(4) Resolutely implement the Management Committee's decisions. After the Management Committee's decision is promulgated by the factory director's order, it must also be organized for inspection and supervision of implementation, otherwise it will affect the credibility of the Management Committee.

Fourth, the leadership should regularly go deep into the masses and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

In addition to holding mass meetings and going to the workshops to understand the situation and discover problems, the leaders of Machine Tool Plant No. 5 also took the following measures to get close to the masses: (1) participate in various meetings of employees; (2) regularly hold symposiums for advanced producers (stipulated twice a month) and other symposiums; (3) the factory director regularly receives workers for talks; (4) visit employee dormitories.

In order to encourage the masses to speak boldly and carry out criticism, the leadership should first make sincere self-criticism to dispel the concerns of the masses. The leadership must pay attention to every small opinion and criticism of the masses, and should answer every question and do what is said.

Fifth, promote a large number of organized technical workers to serve as cadres.

This is one of the important steps to combine leadership with the masses. For example, since 1949, the May First Factory has promoted a total of 800 new cadres from the entire factory's party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations, of which more than 70% were promoted from among the workers. These cadres are familiar with production, workers' thinking, and life, and have close ties with the working masses, which makes it easier for them to correctly combine with the masses. For grassroots administrative management cadres, such as group leaders and foremen, who are directly in contact with workers, they should be planned to approach and train them, such as the Machine Tool Plant No. 5 cultivated the Ma Hengchang team, promoted his experience, and enabled the democratic management to be implemented in the grassroots administrative management.

At the same time, the establishment of a workshop production supervision committee is also an important measure for democratic management. It can enable the resolutions of the Management Committee to be implemented in the workshop.

　　怎样实行管理民主化？
    介绍沈阳机器五厂与五一工厂的经验
    根据沈阳机器五厂和五一工厂的经验，实行工厂管理民主化，不仅是限于搞好工厂管理委员会和职工代表会，而且是要从各个方面实行民主管理。因此，能否贯彻管理民主化的关键，就在于依靠群众的思想是否搞通，否则，管理民主化势必流于形式。该两厂是从以下几个方面来实行民主管理的。
    第一、生产管理上的重大问题，要和全厂职工商量。生产管理上的重大问题，不仅要经过工厂管理委员会讨论，而且要使全厂职工知道并发动他们讨论。
    （一）生产计划的讨论。比如，第五机器厂在每月十五日以前，把下月的生产计划，先经工厂管理委员会常委会讨论通过后，发到各车间，按生产小组进行讨论，把大家意见集中起来，再经工厂管理委员会最后讨论确定，由行政正式向全厂宣布。使行政的生产计划变为大家的计划。这样，任务的完成，便有了保证。
    （二）生产进度，任务完成的情况及所遇到的困难，应定期向职工做报告。第五机器厂规定各车间每半月报告一次生产情况，报告后各小组进行检讨；每月开全厂职工代表会议一次，由厂长做报告，使全厂职工经常了解生产情况，关心生产中的问题。
    （三）各种管理制度的制定，须经过自上而下与自下而上的反复讨论研究，俟思想上酝酿成熟后，再明文颁布。只有吸收了群众的意见，才能使制度更妥善完备和合乎实际情况，同时职工也才能认真负责的执行。
    （四）每当一个新的运动到来或有重大问题的措施时，必须把方针政策向全厂职工交待清楚，才能发挥职工积极性，实现领导意图，不致出偏差。
            第二、关心职工福利事业和劳动条件，抓紧职工教育。
    要依靠职工办好工厂，同时也必须关心职工福利事业和劳动条件，抓紧职工教育，提高职工的政治觉悟。对有条件而又可以办好的集体福利事业和便利生产、保障安全的劳动设备应主动办好。比如五一工厂给职工办了夜间休养所、食堂、澡塘、托儿所、图书馆、电影院、合作社、子弟小学等，去年一年为职工福利事业开支的费用约合东北币一百二十二亿八千八百六十四万元。因而解决了职工的生活顾虑，可以安心生产。在提高职工的文化和政治水平方面，五一工厂的一所、三所都举办了较正规的业余学校，补习文化、技术和政治，有计划的来培养和提高职工。
    第三、开好工厂管理委员会会议和职工代表会议真正发挥其作用，不使流于形式。
    开好工厂管理委员会会议，首先要领导上重视管委会，多想办法，发挥管委会的作用。根据第五机器厂的经验，开好管委会会议要做到：
    （一）使代表在会前有充分准备，搜集群众意见带上来。该厂在管委会开会的前三天，就把会议要讨论的问题的提纲发下去，让代表有充分时间到群众中去搜集意见。事实证明，只要事前有了准备，工人代表就能提出很多宝贵意见。
    （二）会议内容不要多，每次讨论一两个中心问题。问题少，中心明确，意见也容易准备，会议时间也短。会前常委会还要准备出方案，但开会时应尽量启发工人代表先发言，多发言。
    （三）会议要做出明确决定，让代表带回去。为使会议决定贯彻到群众中去，第五机器厂采取了四个方法：（一）把每次会议的决议都油印散发；（二）由厂部用布告形式公布；（三）工人代表参加车间管委会进行传达；（四）由工人代表在某些会议上直接向工人进行传达。总之，用各种办法把决议传达给职工，以加强领导与群众间的联系。
    （四）坚决执行管委会决议。管委会决议以厂长命令颁布后，还必须组织检查，督促执行，否则会影响管委会的威信。
            第四、领导上要经常深入群众和开展批评与自我批评。
    机器五厂领导上除了开群众大会和下车间了解情况发现问题外，还采取下述办法接近群众：（一）参加职工的各种会议；（二）定期召开先进生产者座谈会（规定每月两次）和其他座谈会；（三）厂长定期接见工人谈话；（四）到职工宿舍进行访问。
    为启发群众大胆发言，开展批评，领导上要首先做诚恳的自我批评，解除群众的顾虑。对于群众的每一细小意见和批评，领导上必须加以重视，应该做到有问必答，说到做到。
            第五、大量提拔有组织能力的技术工人担任干部。
    这是使领导与群众相结合的重要步骤之一。如五一工厂从一九四九年到现在，全厂党、政、工、团共提拔了八百名新干部，其中百分之七十以上是从工人当中提拔出来的。这些干部对于生产、工人思想、生活等都很熟悉，与工人群众有着密切联系，这样便于通过他们正确的与群众相结合。对于基层行政管理干部，如组长、工长等，都是直接接近工人的，应有计划的接近和培养他们，如机器五厂培养了马恒昌小组，推广了他的经验，使管理民主化在基层行政管理方面得到贯彻。
    同时，建立车间生产监督委员会，也是管理民主化的一个重要措施。它可以使管委会的决议在车间得到贯彻。
