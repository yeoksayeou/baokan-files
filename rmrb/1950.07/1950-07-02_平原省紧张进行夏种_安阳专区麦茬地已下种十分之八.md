　　Pingyuan Province Intensively Carries Out Summer Planting
    Anyang Prefecture Has Planted Eight-Tenths of Wheat Stubbles
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Pingyuan Province is intensively carrying out summer planting after the wheat harvest. The wheat harvesting work in various counties has basically met the requirement of "harvesting well". In order to achieve "planting well" and leave no land uncultivated, the Provincial People's Government issued an instruction on June 8 to vigorously carry out summer planting, calling on all localities to seize the season and rush to plant in a timely manner. It specifically pointed out: strengthen organization to solve the difficulties of labor and livestock; mobilize the masses to plow and harrow, and weed, advocating plowing and harrowing or weeding before planting; in areas with little or no rain, organize spot planting in a timely manner, and lead the digging of canals and wells and the lending of waterwheels to resist drought for a long time; governments at all levels and cooperatives, banks, etc. should earnestly find ways to solve the problem of seed difficulties for the masses; when planting, attention should also be paid to seed selection, soaking, and mixing, so as to ensure that seedlings emerge neatly, grow vigorously, and have fewer diseases.
    Anyang Prefecture experienced continuous rainfall on June 16, 17, and 18, but the rainfall was very uneven and not widespread enough. The rainfall areas organized the masses to rush to plant, and widely organized mutual aid labor in the rush planting. For example, in Lijia Factory Village, Lin County, each mutual aid group specifically formulated a plan after the rain, dividing the work between men and women, harvesting wheat and planting, and completed everything within three days. Currently, the planting area in the entire prefecture has reached about 80% of all wheat stubble land. Among the 406 villages in Anyang County, there are still 60 villages that have not been planted. Lin County has only 67,000 mu of the 670,000 mu of wheat stubble land unplanted. Only one district in Ye County has not been planted. Qi County, under the slogan of "harvest one piece, plant one piece," rushed for ten days, completing the harvest of 350,000 mu of wheat and completing the planting of 200,000 mu of wheat stubble land. Afterwards, due to very little rain, planting was not possible, so drought-resistant spot planting was carried out according to different conditions; the Democratic Canal and Miaokou Canal in the county have released water for irrigation. A well-digging campaign was widely launched in the Third District; Doujie, Xigang, Haojie, and other six villages alone have dug 122 wells. Nanguan Village in the First District pre-plowed the land into furrows. Recently, even with only two fingers of rain, it was possible to plant, and 150 mu were planted in one day. In Siqu, the masses of Siqu Village cut old corn stalks into four- or five-inch-long sections, soaked them in water, and put one or two sections at the root of the seedlings during spot planting to maintain moisture and strengthen drought resistance.
    Bo'ai County has been dry and rainless recently. Villages along the Dan River used the Dan River water conservancy to irrigate and plant. Due to the strengthening of water conservancy organization and the implementation of the water use agreement, and the scientific management of water conservancy, this year's irrigation and planting have proceeded extremely smoothly. By the 19th of this month, more than 50,000 mu had been planted. In Daxinzhuang Village, all 1,500 mu of autumn land used to take at least half a month to irrigate in previous years, but this year it only took 60 hours. Villages upstream irrigated day and night in order to finish irrigating early so that villages downstream could use water in a timely manner. In order to save time, many villages planted at night. On the night of the 19th in Qifang Village, First District, there were more than 100 lanterns scattered like stars in the east of the village, illuminating the farmers who were rushing to plant, which was rare in history. In Xiguan, Shazhuang, and other villages in the county, the CCP branch mobilized the masses to use the river channels dug last winter and this spring for drainage for irrigation. 2,000 mu of the 2,500 mu of wheat stubble land in Xiguan have been planted, and more than 500 mu have also been planted in Shazhuang.
    Qingfeng, Fanxian, and other places also experienced widespread rainfall around June 17th. The leaders of these counties promptly issued emergency instructions, calling on them to organize and rush to plant while it rained. In Qingfeng's Eighth District, the common rainfall on the evening of the 16th reached three or four fingers. On the morning of the 17th, all district cadres went to the countryside in separate groups to lead and promote the masses to rush to plant through the village people's congresses and various mass organizations. In two days, they planted more than 62,000 mu, accounting for about 70% of the total of 90,000 mu of wheat stubble land.
    In order to ensure increased production, local leaders have paid attention to the leadership of warm water seed soaking. Huixian, Bo'ai, and other places democratically formulated a resolution at the county's representative meetings of all circles that 30% of the summer planting should involve seed soaking; Linxian, Jixian, Anyang, and other counties called on party members to take the lead in leading the masses to soak seeds in warm water at party congresses. Various counties have made many achievements in seed soaking during summer planting. In particular, in Datun Village, First District of Linxian, all but 9 mu of the village's more than 800 mu of wheat stubble land were soaked in seeds.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, 27th] From the 16th to the 18th of this month, 32 counties in Pingyuan Province, including Heze, Huixian, and Bo'ai, successively experienced timely rainfall, most of which had penetrated, and a few had about two fingers of rain. The local farmers, delighted by this welcome rain, immediately began planting intensively. Most of the autumn fields in the province have now been planted. During the planting process, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government and the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee formed work teams to go to the countryside to lead the farmers in planting, and the Huxi Prefecture established planting headquarters at all levels below the prefecture commissioner's office. In order to solve the problem of seed shortage for farmers, the Pingyuan local people's governments, in addition to mobilizing farmers to adjust seeds on their own, also allocated a portion of seed grain loans.

　　平原省紧张进行夏种
    安阳专区麦茬地已下种十分之八
    【本报讯】平原全省于麦收结束后，正紧张进行夏种。各县麦收工作基本上做到了“收得好”的要求。为了做到“种得好”，不留一块荒地，省人民政府于六月八日特发出关于大力进行夏种的指示，号召各地抓紧季节，及时抢种。并具体指出：加强组织起来，解决劳畜力困难；发动群众犁耙、锄草，提倡犁耙后或锄草后再种；无雨少雨地区，适时组织点种，并应领导开渠打井与贷放水车，长期抗旱；各级政府及合作社、银行等应认真设法解决群众种籽困难；下种时并应注意选种、浸种、拌种，务使苗棵出得齐、长得旺、病害少。
    安阳专区于六月十六、十七、十八三天连续落雨，但雨量极不均匀，亦不够普遍。落雨地区组织了群众突击抢种，在抢种中并广泛组织了互助劳动。如林县李家厂村各互助组，雨后具体订了计划，男女分工，收麦下种，三天内全部完成。现全专区下种面积已达全部麦茬地的百分之八十左右。安阳县四百零六个村中，尚有六十个村未下种。林县六十七万亩麦茬地仅余六万七千亩未下种。邺县未下种的只有一个区。淇县在收一片、种一片的口号下，紧张突击十天，除全部收完三十五万亩麦子外，并完成二十万亩麦茬地的下种。其后因雨量很少，不能下种，乃根据不同条件进行抗旱点种；该县民主渠、庙口渠已放水浇地。三区普遍展开打井运动，仅豆街、西岗、郝街等六村即已打井一百二十二眼。一区南关村预先将地耕成沟，最近仅下雨二指，亦可下种，一天种完了一百五十亩。四区对寺窑村，群众把旧玉茭秆切成四、五寸长一段，用水浸透，点种时放一二段于苗根，以保持水分，加强抗旱能力。
    博爱县近日天旱不雨，沿丹河各村，利用丹河水利浇地下种，由于加强了水利组织机构，贯彻使水公约，科学掌握水利，使今年浇地、下种进行极为顺利，至本月十九日止，即已下种五万余亩。大辛庄全村一千五百亩秋地，往年至少半月才能浇完，今年只用了六十个钟头。上游村庄浇地昼夜不停，以便提前浇完，使下游各村能及时用水。为争取时间，不少村庄星夜下种。该县一区七方村十九日夜仅村东就有一百多盏灯笼星罗棋布，给进行抢种的农民照明，这在历史上是少见的。该县西关、莎庄等村，中共支部发动群众利用去冬今春为排水而挖的河道进行灌溉。西关二千五百亩麦茬地，已下种二千亩，莎庄也种上了五百多亩。
    清丰、范县等地亦于六月十七日左右普遍落雨，各该县领导上已及时发出紧急指示，号召组织起来，趁雨抢种。清丰八区于十六日晚普遍落雨达三、四指，十七日晨全体区干部即分头下乡，通过村人民代表会及各群众组织领导推动群众抢种，两天时间，即种上六万二千余亩，约占全部麦茬地九万亩的百分之七十。
    为了保证增产，各地领导上均注意了温汤浸种的领导。辉县、博爱等地，在县各界代表会上，民主制定了夏种中浸种百分之三十的决议；林县、汲县、安阳等县，在党代会上号召党员带头领导群众温汤浸种。各县在夏种中，浸种工作均作出了不少成绩，特别是林县一区大屯村，全村八百多亩麦茬地，除九亩外全部作到了浸种。（安阳地委研究室、清丰县委办公室、靳承斌、杜绪文、高孟、和云普）
    【新华社新乡二十七日电】平原省菏泽、辉县、博平等三十二县于本月十六至十八日三天内先后降落时雨，其中大部地区均已下透，少数地区亦落有二指左右。当地农民得此喜雨，立即紧张地进行播种。现全省大部秋田已播种完毕。在播种中，平原省人民政府和中共平原省委曾组成工作队下乡领导农民播种，湖西专区并成立了自专署以下的各级播种指挥部。平原各地人民政府为解决农民缺种的困难，除发动农民自行调剂种籽外，还拨发了一部分种籽贷粮。
