　　State Bank Loans Play a Significant Role in Supporting Private Enterprises
    Work Stoppages Gradually Cease
    Industrialists and Businessmen Have a Promising Future as Long as They Clarify the Ideology of Self-Reliance and Strive to Improve Management.
    [This Newspaper Report] Over the past two months, the State Bank has vigorously provided loans to support private industry and commerce. According to statistics from the seven major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and Xi'an alone (excluding the head office), the loan balance had reached over 300 billion by June 23. This has played a significant role in resolving the temporary difficulties encountered by private industry and commerce. The phenomenon of work stoppages and closures in private industry and commerce has gradually ceased across the country. For example, the Jingye Leather Factory in Beijing, which originally had relatively good product quality and a promising future, had been shut down for a month due to sluggish sales. After receiving a loan of 70 million, it purchased raw hides and resumed production. In the Handan weaving industry, six factories had stopped work or were preparing to close in April. After receiving loans from the bank, they had resumed production by early June. At the same time, some factories avoided shutdowns because they received loans in a timely manner. The production of the Jianguo Iron Factory in Beijing was not interrupted. Minsheng Company, a shipping company in Chongqing, also overcame its difficulties with multiple loans from the State Bank. Secondly, the equipment conditions of some factories have been improved, making it easier to increase production. Chongqing Electric Power Company used the loan to repair the third power plant, which will increase the power supply to various factories; private shipping companies received loans of 4.4 billion, which will be used to repair ships and strengthen water transportation. The Tongyi Iron Factory in Beijing originally planned to make one lathe in May, but after receiving a loan, it produced five; the Jusheng Foundry undertook the production of waterwheel blades for the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, the North China Construction Company, and other agencies. It improved its equipment with loans, resulting in a twofold increase in output and improved quality. Furthermore, trade was enlivened, prices were appropriately adjusted, and the unreasonable exchange of prices falling at the place of origin for some export goods was stopped. The ratio of Xining wool to city cloth per 100 jin in Baotou City, Suiyuan, gradually increased from 1.7 bolts to 4.2 bolts at the end of April through documentary bills and loans for procurement outside the port, thereby stimulating the marketing of cashmere. The number of fur shops increased from 29 to 49. After 17 households in the Zhangjiakou fur industry obtained loans of 625 million, they went to Baotou, Wuyuan, and other places to purchase cashmere for export to Tianjin. Among them, Ruichengxiang alone transported more than 32,000 jin of wool with the assistance of the State Bank's documentary bills, which enabled 70 to 80 single peddlers to come to Zhangjiakou from Chabei every day. After Sichuan Silk Company obtained a loan of 11.6 billion, it was all used to purchase silkworm cocoons in rural areas, which not only solved the company's raw material problem but also indirectly helped silkworm farmers in southern and northern Sichuan. Yufeng and other six iron companies in Handan obtained a loan of 20.5 million and went to Anyang and Shizhuang to purchase pig iron for making waterwheels after the wheat harvest. In addition, loans have also promoted the active management and confidence in production of some factory owners, who have invested new funds and expanded production.
    In general, thanks to the strong leadership of the People's Government and the full adjustment of the relationship between industry and commerce and public-private partnerships by relevant departments, coupled with bank loans, the phenomenon of work stoppages and shutdowns in various places has gradually ceased. For example, in Shanghai, 29 of the 30 iron and steel smelting industries had started work in May, and the other two were also preparing to resume work. Shanghai's electricity production in May increased by 11% compared with April and 14% compared with March.
    The loan work in the past two months has indeed made certain achievements in supporting industry and commerce. However, there are still some problems:
    First, the issue of self-reliance for industrialists and businessmen. In the past, during periods of price fluctuations, the State Bank provided significant subsidies to private industry and commerce in the process of issuing monetary loans. Now, in the process of stable price declines, the State Bank, like other financial and economic departments, is concerned about the difficulties of the business community and is providing assistance. Naturally, industry and commerce should also assist the government, contribute their strength, and strive to overcome their current temporary difficulties. However, in some places, factories rely on the bank to mortgage freight charges for transporting machinery during internal relocation, and after arriving at the destination, they do not contribute funds to start work but still complain and wait for the government and the bank. This idea of completely relying on bank loans must be corrected. Industrialists and businessmen should clarify the ideology of self-reliance, contribute their strength, and improve management in order to have a promising future.
    Second, the issue of loan targets. Taking the number of industrial households in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou as an example, there are more than 21,000 households. Under the circumstances that the economy has suffered too much war damage and has not yet been healed, the funds needed are extremely large. Although the State Bank is prepared to vigorously support and organize private idle funds to face production, compared with the overall needs, there is still a large gap. Therefore, it can only find the key points among the key points, and specifically weigh the "priority," "quantity," "importance," and "urgency" between industry and commerce, various industries, large, medium, and small households, and take into account whether current production is excessive. In the future, bank credit work needs to be more detailed and in-depth research, and loans should be granted to different targets in order to avoid inappropriate loans, resulting in waste of funds.
    Third, the problem of stagnant loan funds. According to statistics, as of May 11, the total amount of stagnant private loans from the National Bank in Tianjin was 4.6 billion. The amount of stagnation in the Shaanxi Provincial Branch and Xi'an City Branch in May was equivalent to one-third of the total loans issued that month. In Shanghai, 37% of the loans that expired at the end of March were renewed with interest payment, 10% were renewed with interest arrears, and some stagnant loans lasted for as long as three months. Therefore, it must be solved from two aspects: on the banking side, it should continue to raise funds vigorously and continue to help industrialists and businessmen to the best of its ability; on the industrial and commercial side, it should also maintain credit within the possible range, carefully calculate, and minimize the situation of postponement and renewal.
    Fourth, the work style of the State Bank employees. Generally speaking, since the National Financial Conference in February and March, due to the vigorous deposit collection, the bureaucratic work style has been reduced a lot in various places. At the same time, all localities are working hard to connect with the masses to improve work. For example, in May, Tianjin successively held symposiums on textiles, chemical dyes, steel hardware, rubber, machinery, and other industries to listen to opinions and promote business. In early June, under the leadership of the government, Guangzhou coordinated with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to invite people from the business community to hold a symposium, widely solicit opinions, and use them as the basis for improving work. Other places have also held similar meetings. However, on the other hand, it can be seen from the discipline inspection in various places that bad work styles continue to exist in the work of many personnel. Therefore, under the heavy burden of future tasks, how to further solicit opinions from the masses, strengthen self-criticism, and do a better job in supporting industry and commerce requires further efforts from all bank staff.

　　国家银行贷款扶助私营企业起了相当作用
    各地停工现象逐渐停止
    工商业者只要明确自力更生思想，努力改进经营，就有发展前途。
    【本报讯】近两月来，国家银行大力贷款扶助私营工商业，仅据上海、天津、北京、广州、汉口、重庆、西安七大城市统计（总行尚除外），截至六月二十三日止，贷款余额即达三千余亿。这对于解决私营工商业所遭遇的暂时困难起了很大作用。各地私营工商业停工歇业现象已逐渐停止。如北京敬业皮革厂，产品质量原比较好，有发展前途，但因产品滞销，停工达一个月，得到贷款七千万元后，购进生皮原料，便恢复了生产。邯郸织布业中，四月间曾有六家停工和准备歇业，经银行贷款扶助后，六月上旬已开工生产。同时，有的工厂因及时得到贷款，避免了停工。北京建国制铁厂的生产，便没有中断。重庆航运业民生公司也是经国家银行多次贷款而度过了困难。其次，是一些工厂的设备条件得以改善，便于增产。重庆电力公司将贷款用于修复第三发电厂，将增加对各工厂的电力供应；各私营航业获贷款四十四亿，将用以修复船只，加强水运。北京同益铁工厂原计划五月份做一台旋床，得到贷款后，结果做出了五台；聚盛翻砂厂为水利推进社、华北建筑公司等机关承做水车片炉，以贷款改善设备，产量增加两倍，质量也因而提高。再就是活泼了贸易、适当调整了价格，停止了部分出口货产地落价的不合理交换现象。绥远包头市每百斤西宁毛换市布比数，经作押汇及埠外采购贷款，逐次由一·七匹提高到四月底的四·二匹，从而刺激了绒毛的运销，皮毛店便由二十九家增达四十九家。张家口皮毛业十七户获得贷款六亿二千五百万后，即纷赴包头、五原等地采购绒毛，输往天津出口，其中瑞成祥一家通过国家银行押汇扶助，即运羊毛三万二千余斤，从而使察北来张的单人小贩，每日达七、八十人。四川丝业公司获得一一六亿贷款后，即全部用于下乡收购蚕茧，除解决该公司原料外，并对川南川北蚕丝产地之蚕农起了间接扶助的作用。邯郸铁业中裕丰等六家，贷款二千零五十万元后，即到安阳、石庄收购生铁以便麦收后制水车。此外，贷款还促进了部分工厂厂主的积极经营，以及对生产的信心，投入新资金，扩大生产。
    总的说来，由于人民政府大力领导，各有关部门全力调整工商业与公私关系，加上银行贷款，已逐渐停止了各地停工停业现象。如以上海来说，三十家钢铁炼制工业，五月份开工的已达二十九家，其他两家亦正准备复工，上海的电力生产量，五月份已比四月份增加了百分之十一，比三月份增加了百分之十四。
    两个月来的贷款工作，在扶助工商业方面确已作出了一定成绩。但还存在着一些问题：
    第一、工商业者自力更生的问题。以往在物价波动期间，国家银行发放货币贷款过程中对私营工商业贴补极大，于今物价稳落过程中，国家银行又如同其他财经部门一样在关怀工商界的困难，加以扶助，工商业自然也应该协助政府，拿出力量，为克服本身目前暂时存在的困难而努力。但，有的地方，工厂内迁中运机器靠银行作押汇借运费，抵达目的地后，并不拿出资金开工而仍埋怨和等待政府和银行。这种完全依赖银行贷款的想法，是必须改正的。工商业者应明确自力更生的思想，拿出力量，改进经营，才有发展前途。
    第二、贷款对象问题。以沪、津、穗三地工业家数来说即有二万一千余家，在经济上受战争创伤过重且未医好的情况下，需要的资金是极大的，国家银行虽然准备大力扶助，并组织私人游资面向生产，但是如与整个需要相比，还有很大距离，因而只能从重点中找重点，在工、商之间、各种行业之间、大中小户之间，具体权衡“先后”“多寡”“轻重”和“缓急”以及照顾目前生产是否过剩来加以甄别。今后银行信贷工作，需要更细致更深入的进行研究，分别对象进行贷款，才能避免贷款不适当，以致资金浪费的情形。
    第三、贷款资金呆滞问题。据统计，天津截至五月十一日止，国家银行私营贷款，呆滞总数有四十六亿。陕西省分行及西安市行五月份呆滞数相当该月总放款三分之一。上海三月底到期贷款付息转期者占百分之三七，欠息转期者百分之十，呆滞之贷款有长达三个月之久的。因此必须从两方面来加以解决：在银行方面，仍应大力筹措，尽自己所能继续帮助工商业者；在工商业者方面，亦应在可能范围内，维持信用，精打细算，使延期、转期的情事，尽量减少。
    第四、国家银行从业员的作风问题。一般地说，自二、三月份全国金融会议以后，各地由于大力揽收存款的关系，官僚主义作风，是去掉了不少。同时，各地都在努力联系群众以改善工作。如天津五月份曾连续分别召开纺织、化学染料、钢铁五金、橡胶、机器等各业座谈会，听取意见宣传业务。广州六月初在政府领导下，协同工商局邀请工商界人士座谈，广泛征询意见，作为改进工作的基础。其他各地也有类似的会议召开。但另一方面从各地检查纪律中看出，不良作风仍然是在不少的人员工作中继续存在着，因此在今后繁重任务的担子下，如何进一步征求群众意见，加强自我批评，把扶助工商业的工作作得更好，是需要全体银行工作人员更进一步努力的。（王静然）
