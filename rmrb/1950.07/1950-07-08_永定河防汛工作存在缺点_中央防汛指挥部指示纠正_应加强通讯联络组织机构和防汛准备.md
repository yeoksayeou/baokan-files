The Yongding River Flood Control Work Has Shortcomings
Central Flood Control Headquarters Issues Instructions for Correction
Communication Liaison, Organizational Structure, and Flood Control Preparations Should Be Strengthened
[This Newspaper] The Central Flood Control Headquarters, regarding several problems discovered recently during the inspection of Yongding River flood control work, issued instructions to the Hebei Flood Control Headquarters on July 5th.
    The instructions first introduced the water situation and the struggle: The Yongding River's upstream Guanting began to rise at 6:00 AM on June 30th, and began to fall at 12:00 PM. The downstream Lugou Bridge began to rise at 5:00 PM on June 30th, and began to fall after 5:00 AM on July 1st. The flood flow was estimated to be 1,000 cubic meters per second, exceeding the maximum flood flow of last year by a factor of one. Because the upstream Datong and Guanting implemented the decisions of the National Flood Control Conference, they promptly reported the rising water situation to the downstream areas, enabling Lugou Bridge to prepare seven or eight hours early before the flood arrived. The flood control headquarters organized a rescue team and added sacks to the diversion dam overnight, preventing the diversion dam from overflowing. The farmland along the Xiaqing River was preserved. However, the Anlang Highway in Anci downstream was washed away for more than twenty zhang, causing the loss of approximately 20,000 mu of flooded land.
    The instructions pointed out that the flood control leading organs of the river still have many shortcomings in communication liaison, organizational structure, and various flood control preparations. It also emphasized the important role of strengthening communication liaison and timely reporting of water conditions in flood control work. Because Lugou Bridge understood the upstream water conditions earlier, it made flood control arrangements in advance, so it did not suffer any losses. However, the telephone lines from Lugou Bridge to downstream Gu'an, Anci, and other counties have not yet been erected, relying on sending people to convey the water situation along the river, which is very slow. At the same time, the Yongding River Flood Control Headquarters has not yet established direct communication liaison with the various counties, so the downstream counties are not very clear about the upstream rising water situation. The instructions emphasized that the telecommunications liaison below Lugou Bridge must be established quickly.
    The instructions continued: The Yongding River Flood Control Headquarters was not sound enough in its organization before this flood, and it has not yet seriously started work, and some preparations have not been made or have been made very little. Mobilization and organization were quite slow. Until the flood rose, some sections of the embankment had not had anyone come or very few had come; some cadres rushed to the scene temporarily, and some cadres even arrived after the flood peak had passed. The instructions believed that the command relationship must also be improved. The current method of the Hebei Province Flood Control Headquarters separately commanding the flood control headquarters of the three special districts of Baoding, Tongxian, and Tianjin has proven to be very inflexible in this struggle against the Yongding River flood, and it is very likely to delay things in an emergency. Therefore, the Central Flood Control Headquarters believes that organizing a unified command structure for the entire river, upstream and downstream, with the river as a unit, under the command of the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, is much better than the current situation.
    The instructions finally listed the various problems discovered by the Central Flood Control Headquarters when inspecting the downstream embankment sections after the Lugou Bridge flood peak had passed: 1. Many large vehicle crossings across the South Dyke have not yet been filled and repaired, and are only three or four decimeters away from the flood surface. Fortunately, no danger occurred because the flood did not continue to rise. They should be blocked immediately. 2. Some sections of the embankment with difficult soil extraction have not set up soil piles (large piles of soil accumulated on the river embankment for emergency use during floods). In case of emergency, it will inevitably be impossible to cope with. 3. The height of the embankment about one kilometer south of Zhaoying is not enough and should be raised further. 4. According to the reflections of various counties, some patrol members (old river soldiers) are not active or serious in their work, which has a great impact on flood control work and should be solved. In the future, if the dikes and embankments have not been inspected in various places, they should be inspected quickly; if they have been inspected, it is best to check them again carefully, so as not to be too late for temporary remedies.

　　永定河防汛工作存在缺点
    中央防汛指挥部指示纠正
    应加强通讯联络组织机构和防汛准备
    【本报讯】中央防汛总指挥部就最近在检查永定河防汛工作中发现的几个问题，于七月五日向河北防汛总指挥部发出指示。
    指示中首先介绍了水情和斗争经过：永定河上游官厅从六月三十日上午六时起开始涨水，到晚十二时开始下落；下游卢沟桥从六月三十日下午五时起涨水，到七月一日上午五时以后下落。这次洪水流量估计达一千秒立方公尺，超过去年最大洪水流量一倍。由于上游大同和官厅执行了全国防汛会议的决定，及时向下游报告涨水情况，使卢沟桥方面能在洪水到来前七、八小时早作准备。防汛指挥部组织了抢险队，连夜在分水坝上加堆麻袋，使分水坝未被漫溢。小清河沿岸的农田赖以保全。惟下游安次的安廊公路被冲毁二十余丈，造成淹地约两万亩的损失。
    指示指出该河防汛领导机关在通讯联络、组织机构和各项防汛准备工作上，还存在许多缺点。并强调加强通讯联络、及时报告水情在防汛工作中的重要作用。卢沟桥因了解上游水情较早，预先作了防汛布置，所以没有受到损失。而卢沟桥对下游固安、安次等县的电话线还没有架设起来，依靠派人沿河传达水情，非常迟缓。同时永定河防汛指挥部也尚未和各县建立起直接通讯联络的关系，因此下游各县对于上游涨水情况不很明了。指示着重指出卢沟桥以下的电讯联络必须迅速建立起来。
    指示继称：永定河防汛指挥部在此次洪水以前组织上还不够健全，也尚未认真开始工作，有些准备工作还没有作或作得很少。动员组织相当迟缓，直到洪水上涨时，有些堤段还没有来人或来得很少；部分干部临时赶到，甚至有的干部是在洪水峰过去以后才赶到的。指示认为：指挥关系也须加以改善。目前由河北省防汛总指挥部分别指挥保定、通县和天津三个专区的防汛指挥所的办法，在这次与永定河洪水斗争中证明很不灵活，而且很有可能在紧急的情况下耽误事情。因此中央防汛总指挥部认为：以一条河为单位，组织全河上下游统一的指挥机构，受省防汛总指挥部的指挥，比目前的情况要好得多。
    指示最后列举了中央防汛总指挥部在卢沟桥洪水峰过去以后，检查下游堤段时发现的各项问题：一、横穿南堤的许多大车道口子还没有填修，距离洪水面只有三、四公寸，因洪水未继续上涨，幸未出险。应赶紧堵好。二、有些取土困难的堤段，没有设置土牛（河堤上堆积的大土堆，备洪水到来时抢险急用），一旦紧急需要，必致无法应付。三、赵营以南约有一公里长的堤段高度不够，应当继续加高。四、据各县反映，有些巡堤员（老河兵）工作不积极、不认真，这对防汛工作有很大影响，应当设法予以解决。今后各地对堤防尚未进行检查的，应赶快进行检查；已经检查过的，最好也再认真检查一次，以免临时补救不及。
