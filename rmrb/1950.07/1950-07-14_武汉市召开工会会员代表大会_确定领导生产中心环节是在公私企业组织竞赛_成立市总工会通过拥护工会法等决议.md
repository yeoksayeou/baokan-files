Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The first Wuhan City Trade Union Member Representative Conference was held from the 1st to the 7th of this month. The Wuhan City Federation of Trade Unions, which will lead the city's 260,000-strong workers' movement, was established at the meeting. The conference summarized Wuhan's trade union work over the past year and determined the central tasks of the trade union in the future.

　　The conference rigorously criticized the erroneous ideas existing among some working cadres and workers, such as "it is not honorable to work in private enterprises, and doing a good job in production only benefits the capitalists." It determined that the central link of trade union work in leading production is to universally launch production competitions in public and private enterprises. In all public and private enterprises under the leadership of the state-owned economy that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as long as there are production tasks, the trade union must assist the enterprise's administrative side or the capitalists in formulating a factory-wide production plan, mobilizing workers, and formulating group plans and individual plans, and launching production competitions on the basis of planned production. The conference believes that, based on the specific circumstances of Wuhan City at present, the main content of the competition in the near future is to reduce costs and improve quality. In organizing the competition, it is necessary to plan for the large-scale cultivation of model workers and the creation and promotion of advanced production groups.

　　In response to the shortcomings of past trade union work, the conference determined that after the official establishment of the Federation of Trade Unions, it must improve the meeting system, formulate plans, and break away from the circle of administrative affairs. Industrial trade union cadres must spend more than half of their time going deep into the factories to understand the situation and provide concrete help and guidance.

　　In addition, the conference passed resolutions on supporting and resolutely implementing and carrying out the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, as well as resolutions on trade union organizational work, on relief work for unemployed workers, on carrying out workers' spare-time education, and the draft charter of the Wuhan City Federation of Trade Unions. The conference elected Zhao Min, Zhang Pinghua, Wu Defeng and other thirty-five people as members of the Federation of Trade Unions, with Zhao Min as the director and Zhang Jinbao and Huang Minwei as deputy directors.

　　武汉市召开工会会员代表大会
    确定领导生产中心环节是在公私企业组织竞赛
    成立市总工会通过拥护工会法等决议
    【新华社十三日讯】武汉市第一届工会会员代表大会于本月一日至七日召开。会上成立了领导全市二十六万工人运动的武汉市总工会，总结了一年来武汉市的工会工作，并确定了今后工会的中心任务。
    大会严格地批判了在部分工作干部和工人中存在着的“在私营企业中工作不光荣，搞好生产只对资本家有利”的错误思想，确定工会工作领导生产的中心环节是在公营和私营企业中普遍展开生产竞赛。凡在国营经济领导下，有益于国计民生的公私企业，只要有生产任务，工会都必须帮助企业行政方面或资方，制定全厂生产计划，发动工人，制定小组计划与个人计划，在有计划生产的基础上展开生产竞赛。大会认为，根据目前武汉市的具体情况，最近时期内，竞赛的主要内容是降低成本，提高质量。在组织竞赛中，要有计划地大量培养劳动模范，创立和推广先进生产小组。
    针对过去工会工作的缺点，大会确定：总工会正式成立之后，必须健全会议制度，制定计划，摆脱行政事务的圈子。产业工会干部必须以二分之一以上的时间深入到各工厂，进行了解情况，具体帮助与指导工作。
    此外，大会通过了关于拥护并坚决执行和贯彻中华人民共和国工会法的决议，和关于工会组织工作、关于救济失业工人工作、开展职工业余教育等决议案以及武汉市总工会章程草案。大会选出赵敏、张平化、吴德峰等三十五人为总工会委员，以赵敏为主任，张金保、黄民伟为副主任。
