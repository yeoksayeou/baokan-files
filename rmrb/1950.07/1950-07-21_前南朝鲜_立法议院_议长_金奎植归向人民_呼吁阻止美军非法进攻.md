　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th. Kim Kyu-sik, former speaker of the South Korean "Legislative Assembly" (during the US military government era) and chairman of the National Self-Reliance League, delivered a radio address in Seoul on the 16th, expressing his willingness to stand with the Korean people to oppose the crimes of the Syngman Rhee clique in launching a civil war and the American armed intervention in Korea. In his speech, he pointed out: "Our destiny should be decided by the Korean people themselves. The United States' illegal use of the United Nations' name to armed intervention in Korean internal affairs, the bombing and strafing of peaceful residents of all kinds of crimes, will certainly be opposed by the people of the United States and the world." Kim Kyu-sik finally called on international justice forces to immediately stop the illegal American military offensive.

    【新华社平壤二十日电】曾任南朝鲜“立法议院”（美军政府时期）议长及民族自主联盟主席的金奎植，十六日在汉城发表广播演说，表示愿意站到朝鲜人民方面，反对李承晚集团发动内战和美国武装干涉朝鲜的罪行。他在演说中指出：“我们的命运应由朝鲜人民自己决定。美国非法利用联合国名义来武装干涉朝鲜内政，轰炸与扫射和平居民的种种罪行，必定遭到美国与全世界人民的反对。”金奎植最后呼吁国际正义势力立即阻止美军的非法进攻。
