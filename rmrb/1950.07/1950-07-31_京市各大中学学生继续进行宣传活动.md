　　Students in Major Beijing High Schools Continue Propaganda Activities

    [This Newspaper's Report] Students in major middle schools in Beijing are continuing their anti-American aggression propaganda activities.

    On the evening of the 24th, the Tsinghua University Anti-American Imperialism Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Rural Propaganda Team held a propaganda meeting in Haidian Taipingzhuang with about 2,000 local People's Liberation Army soldiers and villagers. Through comedic dialogue and other programs, they propagandized against American imperialist aggression. The next day, the People's Liberation Army soldiers who attended the meeting also held informal discussions. Soldiers from the second platoon of a certain company said, "As long as we work hard, are we still afraid of these American young master soldiers?" A soldier from the third platoon said, "We firmly oppose war. But we firmly support the just war, the Korean People's Liberation War." (Tsinghua Correspondence Group)

    The Fu Jen Catholic University Labor Union and Student Union, in order to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, held a "Movement Rally Against American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea" at the Fu Jen Catholic University Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. on the 28th of this month. Attendees included Fu Jen Catholic University faculty, staff, and students, as well as cadres from the Fourth District Labor Union, students from the Fu Jen Catholic University Affiliated High School, and representatives from the National Grain Processing Conference, totaling about a thousand people.

In addition to the principal, faculty, staff, and students, more than 100 students from the women's night school also participated.
