Xinhua News Agency, 5th—The China National Relief Association has issued a statement opposing the armed aggression of the American imperialists against the Asian people. The full text is as follows:

    The American imperialists are intensifying their attacks on the Asian people. Under the guise of an illegal resolution of the United Nations, they are mobilizing naval, land, and air forces to massively slaughter the Korean people; disregarding our country's territory and sovereignty, they are dispatching troops in an attempt to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan; and actively assisting reactionary forces within Southeast Asian countries, brutally massacring peaceful people.

    If the aggressive actions of the American imperialists are not stopped, they will bring immense disaster to all the people of Asia. We, as relief workers, deeply know the suffering of the Chinese people caused by the disasters created by the American imperialists. In order to save all the people of Asia and the world from falling into the disasters created by the American imperialists, we strongly protest the aggressive actions of the American imperialists and firmly support Premier Zhou's statement. Our Chinese people must not only liberate our own Taiwan from the hands of the American imperialists, but also unite with all the people of Asia and the world to strive for the complete elimination of the American imperialists, the creators of disasters for all mankind.

　　反对美帝武装进攻亚洲人民
    【新华社五日讯】中国人民救济总会顷发表反对美帝国主义者武装进攻亚洲人民的声明。全文如下：
    美帝国主义者加紧对亚洲人民的进攻，以联合国非法的决议为掩饰动员海、陆、空军大举屠杀朝鲜人民；蔑视我国的领土、主权，出动兵力，企图阻挠我解放台湾；积极援助东南亚国家内的反动势力，惨杀和平人民。
    美帝国主义者这种侵略行为，如不加以制止，将带给全亚洲人民极大的灾难。我们从事救济工作者深知中国人民在美帝国主义者制造的灾难中所遭受的痛苦。为了使全亚洲人民、全世界人民免于陷在美帝国主义者制造的灾难中，我们严重抗议美帝国主义者的侵略行为，坚决拥护周总理的声明。我中国人民不仅要从美帝国主义者手中解放自己的台湾，更要与全亚洲人民、全世界人民联合在一起，为彻底消灭全人类的灾难制造者美帝国主义者而奋斗。
