    Initial Successes in the Rectification Campaign in Southern Sichuan

    The cadre rectification campaign in the Southern Sichuan region has achieved initial successes. The first group to participate in the rectification were high-level cadres at the level of CCP prefectural committees and commissioners and above, including those from the CCP district committee, administrative office, and military region.

    In the half-year since the liberation of Southern Sichuan, achievements have been made in suppressing bandits, collecting grain, levying taxes, and promoting public bonds. However, in the above work, there also existed serious tendencies of bureaucracy and commandism. In the grain collection work, because some cadres lacked a clear mass perspective and policy awareness in their leadership, they were not good at mobilizing and relying on the masses, and their investigation and research were poor, with insufficient in-depth discovery and resolution of problems; they simply pursued figures, which fueled the development of bureaucracy and commandism at lower levels. Under the impatient mood of completing tasks urgently, serious violations of policy occurred, such as randomly detaining and beating people.

    In this rectification, after reading rectification documents and conducting self-criticism in conjunction with work, especially after a relatively profound exposure of bureaucracy and commandism in grain collection work and other deviations in policy implementation. In areas where the grain collection task was not completed, the rectification strengthened the cadres' confidence and determination to grasp policies, overcome difficulties, and complete the task. In areas where the task was basically completed, the disastrous consequences caused by bureaucracy and commandism violating policies were experienced, and it was clearly recognized that policies must be corrected, the bad work styles of bureaucracy and commandism must be overcome, and the work of the second half of the year must be studied with the spirit of correcting policies and strengthening the mass perspective.

    川南整风初获成效
    川南区干部整风已取得初步成效。第一批参加整风的是川南各中共地委、专员以上包括中共区党委、行署、军区一级的高级干部。
    川南区解放半年来在剿匪、征粮、税收、推销公债等工作中，均有成绩。但上述工作中，也严重地存在着官僚主义与命令主义的倾向。在征粮工作中由于有些干部在领导上没有明确的群众观念与政策观念，在工作中不善于发动与依靠群众，调查研究较差，深入发现、解决问题不够；只是单纯的追求数字，以致助长了下面官僚主义、命令主义的发展。在急于完成任务的急躁情绪下，发生了随便扣人、打骂人等严重违反政策现象。
    此次整风中经过阅读整风文件，结合工作进行检讨，特别是比较深刻的揭发了征粮工作中的官僚主义与命令主义及执行政策中的其他偏差。征粮任务未完成的地区，经过整风，加强了干部掌握政策，克服困难，完成任务的信心与决心。在任务基本完成地区，体会了因官僚主义、命令主义违反政策所造成的恶果，明确的认识到必须端正政策，克服官僚主义与命令主义的不良作风，并以端正政策、加强群众观念的精神，研究了后半年的工作。
