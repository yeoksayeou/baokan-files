Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th. The first plenary session of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, marking an unprecedented great unity of all nationalities, revolutionary classes, democratic parties, and other patriotic elements in the Southwest region, solemnly opened in Chongqing on the 27th.  Among those present were Chairman Liu Bocheng, Vice Chairmen He Long, Deng Xiaoping, Xiong Kewu, Long Yun, Liu Wenhui, Wang Weizhou, and 76 military and administrative committee members (with 11 members excused due to leave). The central agenda item of this meeting is the issue of rent reduction.

In his opening address to the conference, Chairman Liu Bocheng pointed out: Last October, the People's Liberation Army, under the command of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, marched into the Southwest. Thanks to the concerted struggle of the broad masses of workers and peasants, all democratic classes, ethnic minorities, and other patriotic elements in the Southwest, as well as the coordinated actions of uprising generals, the Liberation Army was able to rapidly destroy the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the Southwest. For the past seven or eight months, our work has been carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government and the provisions of the Common Program. Militarily, the work of liberating Tibet is continuing; bandits and special agents have been largely eliminated, and the improvement and education work of the uprising troops has been very successful. This year, in individual areas, the disasters caused by the Chiang bandit gang's years of rule, oppression, banditry, and natural disasters have been promptly relieved and have now stopped developing. In areas where banditry has been quelled, the masses have begun to organize production. In urban areas, production in various industries is gradually recovering, prices are stable, people's lives are tending towards stability, and industry and commerce are continuing to adjust. In addition, some progress has been made in providing relief to unemployed workers and in culture and education. People's representatives conferences have been held successively in various places, and the relationship between the government and the people has been initially established. Regarding the central agenda item for discussion at this meeting, Chairman Liu proposed the issue of rent reduction. Chairman Liu said: Only by developing production can we strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation, and rent reduction is a key link in developing production, laying a solid foundation for the land reform movement that will begin next winter. Chairman Liu concluded by saying: Our work has difficulties, but as long as everyone unites, works closely together, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, with the Common Program as the highest guideline, all difficulties can be overcome.

Subsequently, Vice Chairmen He Long, Xiong Kewu, Long Yun, Liu Wenhui, members Lu Han, Zhou Suyuan, Xia Ke Dao Deng, Liang Juwu, Chu Tunan, Xu Chonglin, Luo Renyi, etc., delegate Li Zixiang attending as observers, and Liu Geping, head of the Central Ethnic Visiting Group from Beijing, spoke at the conference successively. Vice Chairman Liu Wenhui and member Lu Han reiterated their determination to support land reform, as they had expressed at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They expressed satisfaction with the government's work over the past seven or eight months. In particular, the work of suppressing bandits has been very successful, with 340,000 bandits annihilated in recent months, stabilizing social order and restoring urban and rural production. They expressed respect for the People's Liberation Army's bandit suppression troops for their perseverance, enduring hardship, and heroic combat. The issue of uniting ethnic minorities is a particularly important issue in the Southwest region, and everyone unanimously expressed concern. Liu Geping, head of the visiting group, pointed out that there are dozens of ethnic minorities in the Southwest, scattered in various places, and it is necessary to unite them and establish a new and happy life in accordance with the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program. Member Xia Ke Dao Deng (Tibetan) from the frontier said: The policy of equality and unity among nationalities in the Common Program is what the Tibetan people have longed for for many years. Facts have proven that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government can people of all nationalities truly be equal, loving, and closely united with each other. He finally excitedly shouted: "Tibetan compatriots unite, crush the imperialist conspiracy, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, support the liberation of Tibet and plant the five-star national flag on the Himalayas!" Vice Chairman He Long called on Communist Party members at the meeting to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, be humble and prudent, and cooperate with non-Party members, and must oppose the tendency of closed-doorism.

After the opening ceremony, the meeting continued to hear important reports, including Chairman Liu Bocheng's "Work Tasks in the Southwest Region," member Zhang Jichun's "Report on the Issue of Rent Reduction in the Southwest Region," member Liu Daifeng's "Report on Financial and Economic Work in the Southwest," member Zhou Shidi's "Report on Military Work," and member Chu Tunan's "Report on Cultural and Educational Work."

　　标志西南各民族各革命阶级民主党派的大团结
    西南军政委员会首次会议开幕
    刘伯承主席致开幕词指出减租问题为会议中心议题
    【新华社重庆二十八日电】标志着西南区各民族、各革命阶级、各民主党派及其他爱国分子空前大团结的西南军政委员会第一次全体委员会议，二十七日在重庆隆重揭幕。出席的有刘伯承主席，贺龙、邓小平、熊克武、龙云、刘文辉、王维舟六位副主席及军政委员七十六人（另有委员十一人请假缺席）。此次会议的中心议题为减租问题。
    刘伯承主席向大会致开幕辞时指出：去年十月人民解放军奉毛主席、朱总司令命令进军西南。由于西南广大工农群众、各民主阶级、少数民族及其他爱国分子的一致奋斗和起义将领的配合行动，解放军得以迅速摧毁了蒋介石匪帮在西南的反动统治。七八个月以来我们的工作都是遵照中央人民政府的指示和共同纲领的规定进行的。在军事上，解放西藏的工作正继续进行；土匪特务已经大部肃清，起义部队的改进教育工作也很有成绩。今年在个别地区，由于蒋匪帮多年统治压榨、匪患和天灾而造成的灾荒已得到及时的救济，现已停止发展。在匪患平息地区，群众已经开始组织生产。城市方面，各业生产在逐步恢复，物价平稳，人民生活趋于安定，工商业正继续调整。此外，在救济失业工人、文化教育方面，也均有若干成绩。各地先后召开各界人民代表会议，政府与人民的关系已初步结合。关于这次会议讨论的中心议题，刘主席提出为减租问题。刘主席说：只有发展生产才能争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转，而减租却是发展生产的一个主要环节，并为将于明冬开始的土地改革运动打下坚实基础。刘主席最后说：我们的工作是有困难的，但只要大家团结一致，亲密共济，在中央人民政府及毛主席领导下，以共同纲领为最高准则，则一切困难都是能够克服的。
    接着，贺龙、熊克武、龙云、刘文辉四位副主席，卢汉、周素园、夏克刀登、梁聚五、楚图南、徐崇林、罗任一等委员，列席代表李紫翔及由京来渝的中央民族访问团刘格平团长等相继在大会上发言。刘文辉副主席及卢汉委员并再次表示他们在政协全国委员会第二次会议上所表示过的拥护土地改革的决心。他们对于政府七八个月来的工作，表示满意。特别是剿匪工作成绩很大，数月来歼匪众三十四万，安定了社会秩序，恢复城乡生产。对人民解放军剿匪部队的不避艰苦，英勇作战，他们表示敬意。团结少数民族问题是西南区的特殊重要问题，大家一致表示关心。大会来宾刘格平团长指出西南少数民族有数十个之多，散布各地，必须按照共同纲领中规定的民族政策，团结他们建立新的幸福生活。来自边疆的夏克刀登委员（藏族）发言说：共同纲领中的民族平等团结政策，是藏族人民多年来所渴望的，事实证明只有在毛主席共产党和人民政府领导下，各民族人民才能真正平等友爱和互相亲密团结。他最后兴奋地高呼：“西藏同胞团结起来，粉碎帝国主义阴谋，在毛主席领导下，支援解放西藏，把五星国旗插到喜马拉雅山上去！”贺龙副主席在会上号召共产党员要遵照毛主席的指示，谦虚谨慎地与党外人士合作，必须反对关门主义倾向。
    开幕式后，会议继续听取了刘伯承主席的“西南区工作任务”的报告，张际春委员的“关于西南区减租问题的报告”，刘岱峰委员的“关于西南财经工作的报告”，周士第委员的“关于军事工作的报告”和楚图南委员的“关于文化教育工作的报告”等五个重要报告。
