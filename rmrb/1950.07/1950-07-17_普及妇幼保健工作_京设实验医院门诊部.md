　　Popularizing Maternal and Child Health Work
    Beijing Establishes Experimental Hospital Outpatient Department
    In order to care for women's health and reduce infant mortality, the Ministry of Public Health has temporarily established a maternal and child health experimental hospital outpatient department at No. 8 Boluocang, Denei, New Fourth District, Beijing. The doctors are all from Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The initial registration fee is 500 yuan, and subsequent consultations are free. Medical expenses for the poor will be reduced as appropriate. Due to incomplete facilities, inpatients are not accepted for the time being. Midwifery services are available upon request for only 20 jin of millet. Those who are certified by the district government as being truly poor can apply for free service. The hospital has begun providing consultations. Outpatient hours are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, the hospital will be closed for maternal and child health propaganda. On Mondays and Wednesdays, prenatal check-ups are conducted; on Tuesdays and Fridays, infant health check-ups are conducted; and on Thursdays and Saturdays, gynecological examinations are conducted.

　　普及妇幼保健工作
    京设实验医院门诊部
    中央卫生部为照顾妇女健康及减少婴儿死亡，暂借京市新四区德内簸箩仓八号设立妇幼保健实验医院门诊部。医师均为协和医院大夫。初诊收号金五百元，复诊不再收费，贫寒者医药费酌予减收。因设备尚未完善，暂不接受住院者。接生随请随到，只收二十斤小米，经区政府证明确属贫寒者可申请免费。该院已开始应诊，门诊上午八时至十二时，下午停诊进行妇幼卫生宣传，星期一、三孕妇检查，星期二、五幼儿健康检查，星期四、六妇科检查。
