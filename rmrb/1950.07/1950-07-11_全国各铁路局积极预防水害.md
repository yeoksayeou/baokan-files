Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Railway bureaus across the country are currently actively strengthening flood prevention work. The Qiqihar, Jilin, and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus, as well as the Zhengzhou and Shanghai Railway Administrations, have successively established flood prevention and rescue organizations. The bureaus' flood prevention materials and tools, including water damage emergency trains, are generally prepared and in place. Bridge and roadbed repair projects have been completed in several locations. The Changtaiguan Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway was repaired and reopened to traffic on June 5th. The five-arch bridge south of Xuchang was completed at the end of May. Reinforcement of the piers of the Yellow River Railway Bridge is still actively underway. The seven road embankments, revetments, and twenty-three bridge protection projects undertaken by the Hankou Branch Bureau are nearing completion. In order to quickly transmit flood prevention information, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government jointly issued a circular on June 15th, instructing all units under the two ministries nationwide to strengthen communication, exchange flood prevention information, and provide each other with opinions on relevant flood prevention projects. The Zhengzhou, Shanghai, Taiyuan, and Jinzhou Railway Administrations have formulated methods for telephone communication regarding water damage.
