　　The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Issues Decision to Implement Rectification and Strengthening of Cadre Instructions

　　[Xinhua News Agency] The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a decision regarding the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's instructions on the rectification and strengthening of cadres.

　　The decision first analyzes the basic situation of the ideology and work style of Party member cadres in North China, pointing out that among the 1.6 million Party members in North China, 140,000 are cadres detached from production. The vast majority of these are loyal to the Party and the people, courageous in the struggle against the enemy, and have made achievements in their work. This is the fundamental and main aspect, and it must be affirmed. However, many people have also developed shortcomings and errors in many aspects, the most common and prominent of which is a commandist work style that is seriously detached from the masses, violating and undermining the Party and government's policies and decrees, and completing tasks with a rude attitude. Some even use their position in the Party for personal gain and engage in wrongdoing, isolating the Party from the people and stifling the democratic life of the people. Therefore, it is an urgent task to conscientiously implement the Central Committee's instructions in the North China region and strictly rectify the work style of cadres.

　　The decision analyzes the reasons for the formation of this ideology and work style, believing that in addition to the heavy workload, tight schedules, an increase in new Party member cadres, and a lack of experience and ability, some cadres developed a sense of complacency, self-interest, and privilege after the national victory and entering the cities, and were infected with a strong Kuomintang work style. This is also an important reason for the emergence of commandism and detachment from the masses.

　　Based on the principles of the Central Committee's instructions and absorbing the experiences and lessons of previous rectification campaigns in North China, the decision emphasizes that the work of Party rectification and cadre strengthening must have clear goals, steady steps, strong leading backbone, with top leaders taking responsibility and personally taking action, concretely analyzing the situation, and treating different cases differently. It is necessary to adopt the positive aim of strengthening unity within the Party and among the people, through criticism and self-criticism, starting from uniting the entire Party and uniting all the people. Any factors that harm the enthusiasm and creativity of Party members must be prevented and corrected. All levels of leading organs should conduct self-examination. When subordinates make mistakes due to policy and work step regulations from above, leaders should take the lead in self-criticism and should not push the responsibility they should bear onto their subordinates. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the step-by-step approach of rectifying and training leading cadres above the county committee level first, and then rectifying and training district and village cadres. During the rectification and training, it is necessary to be realistic and seek truth from facts, specifically analyze, distinguish between right and wrong, severity and lightness of errors, distinguish between leadership responsibility and execution responsibility, affirm achievements, and correct errors. Efforts should be made to ensure that no erroneous behavior is condoned, and no comrade who should not be harmed is harmed, that correct actions are praised, and that incorrect actions are educated, supplemented by necessary disciplinary actions.

　　On the methods and approaches of rectification and training, the decision emphasizes that it is necessary to grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, adopt the policy of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient"; to transform ideology and unite comrades; and to avoid adopting a surprise attack approach, and to resolutely guard against the erroneous methods of "dismissing upon making a mistake" and "punishing without education." Strictly abide by the Party's principle of democratic centralism, and prevent and oppose any erroneous practices that violate the Party Constitution.

　　The decision clearly points out that the main content of this Party rectification and cadre strengthening is to oppose the commandist work style; the goal is to improve the ideology and work style of the entire Party, especially the cadre Party members, strengthen the mass viewpoint, implement the mass line, and further consolidate the Party's ties with the masses. This is the current urgent task of the North China Party and the fundamental issue to improve the relationship between the Party and the broad masses. Party committees at all levels must pay attention to this work. In order to ensure that Party rectification and cadre strengthening are carried out in a led, organized, and prepared manner throughout the region, the decision also proposes the following specific implementation methods:

　　(1) Train cadres. Before the autumn harvest, each province will select the main cadres from the prefectural and county committees to conduct Party rectification studies, cultivate leading backbone for the rectification campaign, and then train district cadres in turn, with the prefectural or county committees as units. This winter and next spring, branch rectification will be carried out. The main methods will be to train village cadres in turn, continue to strengthen the public work of the Party, summarize and inspect work, award hero models, and conduct branch democratic elections.

　　(2) Party committees at all levels should hold good cadre meetings, formulate rectification plans for their own leadership scope, and implement them after approval by higher authorities.

　　(3) Combine and focus on the central work, prevent the deviation of isolated and closed-door Party rectification, and adopt the methods of inspecting work, summarizing work, and evaluating cadres, and avoid unprincipled disputes.

　　(4) The Party committees and Party branches of leading organs and schools at all levels must conduct rectification through methods such as inspecting work, appraising cadres, and convening representative meetings or congresses. Work, theoretical, and cultural learning should not be interrupted during the process, but the amount of work and learning time can be appropriately reduced when necessary.

　　(5) Establish and improve various democratic systems inside and outside the Party through Party rectification.

　　(6) Use Party publications and newspapers to strengthen guidance on Party rectification work in a timely manner and exchange experiences at any time.

　　(7) The main document to be studied during Party rectification is Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on June 6, "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation." In addition, the following ten documents can be studied: 1. The CPC Central Committee's Decision on Strengthening Party Spirit. 2. The CPC Central Committee's Decision on Investigation and Research. 3. Chairman Mao's report on rectifying the Party's work style, study style, and writing style. 4. Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism." 5. "On the Party's Mass Line" in the report on revising the Party Constitution. 6. Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists' ability to unite and cooperate with non-Party masses. 7. The CPC Central Committee's Decision on Carrying out Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications. 8. Stalin on Leadership and Inspection. 9. Lenin and Stalin on Party Discipline and Party Democracy. 10. Liu Shaoqi's speech at the May Day Labor Day Cadre Conference in Beijing.

　　中共中央华北局发布决定
    执行整风整干指示
    【新华社讯】中共中央华北局发布关于执行中共中央整风整干指示的决定。
    该决定首先分析了华北党员干部当前思想作风上的基本情况，指出：华北党现有的一百六十万党员中，有十四万脱离生产的干部。其中绝大多数对党对人民是忠实的，对敌人斗争是英勇的，工作是有成绩的，这是根本的主要的方面，必须加以肯定。但也有很多人在很多方面发生了缺点与错误，其中最普遍和突出的是严重脱离群众的命令主义作风，违背和破坏党和政府的政策法令，以粗暴的态度去完成任务；有的甚至借党营私为非作恶，隔离了党和人民的联系，窒塞了人民的民主生活。为此，在华北地区认真执行中央指示，严格整顿干部作风，是当前迫切的任务。
    该决定分析了形成这种思想作风的原因，认为除工作任务繁重、时间紧迫，新党员干部增多，经验少，能力弱等以外，部分干部在全国胜利和进入城市后，产生了居功自傲、自私自利等特权思想，沾染了浓厚的国民党作风，这也是产生命令主义和脱离群众的重要原因。
    根据中央指示原则，并吸收了过去华北地区历次整风整党的经验教训，该决定强调指出：整党整干工作必须有明确的目标，稳健的步骤，坚强的领导骨干，首长负责、亲自动手，具体分析情况，分别对待。必须采取从团结全党与团结全体人民出发，经过批评与自我批评，以达到加强党内和人民内部的团结的积极目的。任何伤害党员积极性和创造性的因素，必须防止和纠正。各级领导机关均应自我检讨。凡属由于领导上规定政策和工作步骤而引起下级犯错误者，领导者均应以身作则自我批评，不应把自己应负的责任推到下级去。因此必须采取自上而下，首先整训县委以上领导干部，然后再整训区村干部的步骤。整训中必须实事求是，具体分析，分清是非轻重和错误性质，区别领导责任与执行责任，肯定成绩，纠正错误。做到既不姑息任何错误行为，亦不伤害一个不应伤害的同志，正确的加以表扬，错误的加以教育，并辅之以必要的纪律处分。
    在整训的方法和方式上，该决定强调指出：必须掌握批评与自我批评的武器，采取热情对待，惩前毖后，治病救人的方针；既改造思想，又团结同志；不要采用突击的方式，切戒“有错即撤”、“不教而诛”的错误方法。严格遵守党的民主集中制原则，防止和反对任何违背党章的错误作法。
    该决定明确指出：此次整党整干的主要内容为反对命令主义作风；目的是把全党，首先是干部党员在思想上、作风上提高一步，加强群众观点，贯彻群众路线，进一步巩固党和群众的联系。这是华北党当前迫切的任务，是改善党与广大群众关系的根本问题，各级党委必须重视这一工作。为使整党整干在全区有领导、有组织、有准备地进行，该决定并提出下列具体执行办法：
    （一）训练干部。秋收前各省抽调地委、县委主要干部进行整党学习，培养整风领导骨干，然后以地委或县委为单位轮训区干部。今冬明春进行支部整顿，主要方法为轮训村干部，继续加强公开党的工作，总结和检查工作，评奖英雄模范，进行支部民主选举。
    （二）各级党委要开好干部会，制订自己领导范围的整训计划，经上级批准后实行。
    （三）结合与围绕中心工作进行，防止孤立和关门整党的偏向，采取检查工作、总结工作、鉴定干部的方法，避免无原则的争吵。
    （四）各级领导机关与学校的党委会与党的支部，均须通过检查工作、干部鉴定、召开代表会议或代表大会的方式进行整风。在进行中不应中断工作和理论、文化学习，但必要时可适当减少一些工作和学习时间。
    （五）经过整党把党内外的各种民主制度建立与健全起来。
    （六）利用党刊和报纸，及时加强对整党工作的指导，随时交流经验。
    （七）整党中学习的主要文件是毛主席六月六日在党的七届三中全会的报告《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》，此外可学习下列十种文件：一、中共中央关于增强党性决定。二、中共中央关于调查研究的决定。三、毛主席关于整顿党风学风文风的报告。四、毛主席著《反对自由主义》。五、修改党章报告中“关于党的群众路线问题”。六、斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于与非党群众团结合作。七、中共中央关于在报纸刊物上开展批评与自我批评的决定。八、斯大林论领导与检查。九、列宁、斯大林论党的纪律与党的民主。十、刘少奇在北京五一劳动节干部大会上的演说。
