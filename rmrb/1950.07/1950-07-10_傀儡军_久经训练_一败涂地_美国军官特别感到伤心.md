Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Beset in the quagmire of Korea, the U.S. armed interventionists, in addition to being repeatedly and painfully struck by the Korean People's Army in their isolation, are particularly saddened by the crushing defeat of the Syngman Rhee puppet army. According to a United Press dispatch from the U.S. military headquarters in South Korea on July 7th: "U.S. officers are deeply saddened that the U.S.-trained South Korean army failed to stand its ground and fight the communists. The U.S. advisory group spent two years forming what they considered an elite force, and are now baffled by the fact that the South Korean army retreated arbitrarily and disorderly without permission, and in many cases retreated without even engaging the enemy." "The Americans are indeed quite disappointed to witness the complete collapse of this army, because they considered it to be one of the best armies in Asia. The South Korean army had learned their lessons well. They had studied, learned, and trained diligently. They talked about war very beautifully. However, when the test came, they could not apply the fighting lessons they had been taught in U.S. military schools." According to a United Press reporter: "When the battle south of Seoul was fierce, I patrolled the front lines with a U.S. advisor for four days. On various occasions, I saw troops heading towards defensive positions returning to their original locations two hours later, explaining: 'We were ordered to retreat.' It was impossible to know where the order came from."

　　傀儡军“久经训练”一败涂地
    美国军官特别感到伤心
    【新华社九日讯】陷于朝鲜泥淖中的美国武装干涉者，在他们孤单地一再遭受朝鲜人民军的痛击之余，对李承晚傀儡军的一败涂地特别感到伤心。据合众社南朝鲜美军总部七日电称：“美国军官们对美国训练的南朝鲜军未能站住脚跟和共产党作战一节颇感痛心。美国顾问团人员花了两年的时间组成一支他们认为是精锐的队伍，现在也为下面的事实弄得莫明所以，即南朝鲜军队没有得到允许便擅自无秩序地退却，并且在很多情况中甚至没有和敌人接触就撤退。”“美国人亲眼看着这支军队的彻底溃败，确是颇为失望的。因为他们认为这是亚洲最好的军队之一。南朝鲜军曾把他们的功课学得很好。他们曾努力地研究、学习、锻炼。他们谈起战争来谈得很漂亮。可是，当考验到来时，他们可不会应用他们在美国军事学校所被教给的打仗的功课了。”据合众社记者称：“当汉城以南激战时，我曾偕同美国顾问在前线巡视四日，在各种不同的场合下，我看到开往防守阵地的部队在两个钟头后又回到了原地，他们解释说：‘我们奉命撤退’。要知道命令从那儿来是不可能的。”
