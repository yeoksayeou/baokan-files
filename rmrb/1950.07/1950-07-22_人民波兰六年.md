Six Years of People's Poland
    You Bujin, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China

    On July 22, 1944, the Polish people began a new stage in their history. On this day, in the small town of Helm, on Polish soil just liberated by the Soviet Red Army, the People's Republic of Poland was proclaimed. The Polish People's Government, under the name of the Provisional Government, announced for the first time in history to its own people and the people of the world that, from this day forward, the free Polish working people would decide their own destiny and that the autocratic rule of capitalists and landlords in Poland would be ended forever.

    As the historic declaration of the first People's Polish government was spread by radio, newspapers, and speeches, Hitler's power had already been crushed decisively, and the victorious Soviet Red Army was rapidly advancing across the entire front, liberating Polish soil from the fascist plague. Advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Red Army, undertaking the mission of liberating their own country, was the first Polish army division, established with the help of the Soviet people and Marshal Stalin himself.

    The Polish people everywhere warmly welcomed the liberator of the motherland, the Soviet Red Army, and the sons and daughters of the Polish people, the army corps and regular divisions. These people's armies grew rapidly day by day in battle, because hundreds of thousands of liberated people who had gained free life constantly replenished the ranks. The growth of guerrilla units was not counted by days but by hours, as they devoted themselves to the sacred cause of people's liberation in heroic battles against the enemy.

    In battle, in blood, amidst the roar of tanks, in the smoke that filled cities and villages, in the forests trodden by guerrilla footsteps, under the groans of victims in Gestapo torture chambers, in the destroyed concentration camps, in the joyous voices of people rescued from suffering and death – a new people's Poland was born!

    Returning to the old ways was forever impossible. But what the Polish people did on that particularly significant day (July 22nd) is what we will never forget in everything past and everything future. The working masses of Poland have not forgotten this terrible past for a minute, and will never forget it in the future.

    Before the war, Poland was ruled by capitalists, landlords, militarists headed by Pilsudski, and fascist groups allied with imperialist lackeys. They oppressed not only the Polish people, but also the Ukrainians and Belarusians living on land seized from the Soviet Union in 1920. Their close relationship with international imperialism was like that of a servant to a master. They prepared for war against the Soviet Union. In the international imperialist crusade against socialist countries, they even dreamed of fulfilling the "historic mission" of serving as the vanguard.

    When France dominated capitalist Europe, they danced to its music. When the capitalist bridge leading to European imperialist cruisers was occupied by German landowners, they shamefully and hurriedly turned to serving the German landowners. When the executioner Hitler's bloody hand grasped the baton, showing the world that he was calling for the consolidation of the collapsing capitalist rule, Poland's capitalists, landlords, and militarists immediately became collaborators and loyal servants of the Hitlerite aggressors.

    Due to their deep-seated hatred of the Soviet Union and their fear of the revolutionary movement of the Polish people, they completely sided with Hitler and shamelessly begged him to allow them to march eastward alongside the fascist army.

    Hitler held the Polish fascists tightly in his arms, even suffocating them, demanding the cession of Polish territory and unconditional obedience, which was tantamount to completely depriving Poland of its independence. The Soviet Union had suggested that the two countries help each other to fight against Hitler's aggressors, but the Polish fascists ignored it. Then the expected happened: on September 1, 1939, the German fascist army invaded Poland from the west, north, and south.

    The people took up arms. On the fourth day after the outbreak of the war, the fascist government shamefully fled, and our soldiers, workers, and peasants rose up in heroic resistance. The Communist Party first showed itself to be the protector of the freedom and independence of the motherland. However, heroism and the determination of the people, without arms, organization, and military support, could not save Poland. On September 28, 1939, the flood of Hitler's robber army appeared throughout Poland.

    The days of the terrible Hitlerian occupation began to be numbered.

    The struggle never ceased for a moment. Numerous people's liberation movements and revolutionary organizations were operating underground. This struggle was worth paying a high price for.

    The Hitlerite bandits were determined to turn Poland into a vassal of fascist Germany. They arranged a death sentence for the "disobedient" Polish people, and forcibly allocated the land of the Polish people to the "meritorious" fascists. Factories and workshops were quickly looted after the occupation.

    In this way, according to the will of German imperialism, the division of the Polish nation, which had thousands of years of history, a rich culture, and a fine tradition of fighting for its own freedom and the freedom of other nations, was carried out. Due to the criminal and traitorous policies of the Polish fascists, the Polish people suffered such a fate.

    However, the Polish people, having a great and strong friend in the Soviet Union, saved their motherland from destruction. The Polish people's liberation movement received the sympathy of the Soviet people from the very beginning. When Hitler's Germany treacherously and robber-like attacked the Soviet Union, the Polish people stood on the side of the socialist country. In the rear of Hitler's rule, the fighting friendship of Polish and Soviet guerrillas was closely linked. In the secret environment of Poland, the Polish Workers' Party and its armed force, the People's Guard, were organized. In the Soviet Union, thanks to the efforts of the Union of Polish Patriots, the most advanced people of Polish democracy, Polish communists, received the help of the Soviet government and organized a new People's Polish Army.

    One division after another went to the front line to fight alongside the Soviet Red Army against the common enemy of mankind – Hitlerism. Thus, once again in the history of the Polish people's struggle for freedom, our old military slogan was realized: "For our freedom and yours!" Under this slogan, the Polish people fought for their own freedom and for the freedom of other peoples in Hungary and Austria in 1848, in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-39, in the French people's liberation struggle from 1940-45, in the distant Norwegian fjords, in the hot deserts of Africa, in the sunny land of Italy, and in the high mountains of England. But this time the struggle was not only for the liberation of the Polish people and the liberation of the people of other countries, but simply for the survival of the Polish people. (⑴⑷)

    When Stalin's army, together with the Polish army, with powerful force, drove the Hitlerite bandits back to the Vistula River, it could be said that most of Poland's territory was liberated, and the declaration of July 22 could become a real-life reality.

    The peasants were given land, the state took over the large and small factories – all of which were bombed and burned – the workers organized their own lives, and built new divisions of troops. At that time, the Polish reactionaries, attempting to undermine the great cause of the liberation of the motherland, began shooting at the soldiers of the people's army and negotiating with the German occupiers. They conspired to prematurely provoke the Warsaw Uprising, giving the occupying bandits the possibility of destroying the entire capital.

    The people of Warsaw fought the occupying bandits with unparalleled heroism and in a timely manner. The Nazi executioners and Polish traitors carried out Hitler's orders: "Destroy Warsaw, destroy all potato-growing areas."

    The World War was nearing its end. In January 1945, the soldiers of the Liberation Army, with a new heroic attack, liberated the rest of the territory of Poland in one fell swoop and gave the enemy a final blow. At that time, 500,000 Polish troops participated in this glorious battle.

    Warsaw was liberated.

    But what was left of value...

    The population of Poland before the war was 30 million, and after the war, only 23 million remained. Seven million people fell on the battlefield, died from bombs, died from bullets, some were shot on the streets of cities and villages, some were tortured to death in the basements of the Gestapo and concentration camps, and some died from starvation, disease, and suffering. Warsaw, beautiful Warsaw, became a pile of shapeless ruins, a huge tomb of 300,000 corpses. Gdansk, Szczecin, Wroclaw, and dozens of other cities, and thousands of villages were completely or almost completely leveled and burned. The fields were dug into trenches, and the forests were destroyed by artillery fire. Factories were severely damaged everywhere. Everywhere were graves, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of graves.

    However, the Soviet Union stood with us on the same front, and Stalin stood with us. He helped us to restore our motherland, and in our most difficult years, he extended a helping hand to us. He sent bread to our hungry people, and to restore our railway lines, he sent tools and equipment. In order to clear our destroyed cities, he sent shovels, pickaxes, and machines. He also gave us greater help in terms of personnel, such as the Soviet personnel he sent to us: doctors, engineers, skilled workers, signal management experts, etc.

    In 1947, Poland began to embark on the road to recovery very firmly. The three-year plan for the restoration of Poland began to be implemented. The three years of 1947, 1948, and 1949 saw particularly great industrial development. This was a period of the sharpest and most irreconcilable class struggle against the remnants of landlords and the bourgeoisie. These landlords and capitalists, who before the war sold Poland to French, British, and German imperialists, during the war raped public opinion, attempted to crush the national liberation struggle, continued to slander the Soviet Union, and after the war, turned into slaves of American imperialism.

    The working class and the working masses, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist vanguard, smashed all obstacles and won one victory after another. The worker-peasant alliance was consolidated, and the unity of the working class was strengthened. In December 1948, as a result of the unity of the two workers' parties, the Polish United Workers' Party was formed under the leadership of B. Bierut, the President of the Polish Republic.

    Thanks to the unbreakable alliance with the great Soviet Union and the fraternal mutual cooperation with the people's democratic countries, the people's Poland has embarked on the road of revival at the highest speed.

    The working people victoriously completed their first three-year plan. According to this plan, the output of Polish people's industrial daily necessities must be increased to 225 percent of the pre-war level, and the output of agricultural products must be increased to 110 percent of the pre-war level. All of these goals were achieved as scheduled. In 1938, the year before the war began, the output of industrial products accounted for only 32 percent of the total output. In 1948, it rose to 54 percent, and in 1949, the last year of the three-year plan, it reached 65.8 percent. Poland is no longer a backward agricultural country. In 1949, when the three-year plan was about to be completed, the output of industrial products increased to 174 percent compared with 1937. In 1938, Poland generated 4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and in 1949 – 8 billion.

    The numbers and materials cited above that indicate the achievements that have been reached cannot accurately describe all the achievements. These figures are not enough to explain the wonderful significance of unrestricted free life, not enough to explain the new feelings gained by the working people who are free from the whip, not enough to explain the feelings of the workers who consider themselves the masters of their own country and their own lives after being free from the threat of hunger. These numbers cannot describe the unprecedented new ideological and emotional state of the new people in Polish history, which has arisen after defeating the old exploitation system.

    However, all the masses who have gained victory after experiencing a difficult road of struggle, and the people of all countries who have experienced hardships similar to Poland, will understand all this without any difficulty.

    At the end of 1949, we completed the three-year plan and made preparations for building the foundation of socialism. The resolution of the First Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party stated the following:

    "The power of the state is in the hands of the working people.

    All important leading organizations of the people's economy... are in the hands of the working people.

    Poland is a member of the united anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and must maintain close ties of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, review the achievements that have been made, and review various changes in the national economy. Under these conditions, Poland can put arduous new tasks in front of itself."

    This task refers to the establishment of a socialist foundation, which refers to the political and economic content of the six-year plan.

    In economic terms, to realize the six-year plan, we must achieve:

    In industry, compared with 1949, the output will be increased to 214 percent. The industrial output in 1955 will be 3.5 times the output in 1938. The output of the mining and machinery industries will be increased even more – almost three times higher than in 1949. The metallurgical industry will increase its output by 171 percent, and the electrical industry will increase its output by 227 percent.

    The output in agriculture is expected to reach 145 percent of the output in 1949. This figure can be achieved as long as we accelerate the establishment of collective farms, while fully adopting advanced agricultural technologies and improving our agricultural technology. By the time the six-year plan is completed, collective agriculture will become the main factor in our rural economy.

    The industrial output in 1955 will account for 74 percent of our total output. It can be seen from this that Poland will undoubtedly become an industrialized country by that time.

    On May 30, 1949, the Council of Ministers approved the resolution on the six-year plan. At that time, all class-conscious people in Poland understood that there would be many difficulties in implementing this plan. But from this time on, new and very important factors have occurred on the international stage. In China, the great revolution has been victorious. In Vietnam, in Indonesia, and in Malaya, powerful national liberation movements have unfolded. The Korean people are fighting victoriously against the aggression of American imperialism. The powerful peace camp is consolidating and developing. All these factors make our construction easier and unfold brand new prospects in front of us.

    If the people's Poland expects the support and assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, then on the other hand, the Polish people should also consider supporting and assisting the people of the brother countries when carrying out all the creative labor.

    In order to build socialism, we must quickly achieve lasting peace. The Polish people have deeply understood the horrors of war from painful lessons, and now they recognize the value of constructive peaceful labor even more. Therefore, Poland stands at the forefront of the ranks of defending peace, and actively carries out the struggle to defend peace. 18 million Polish people, that is, all adult people in Poland, participated in the Stockholm Peace Petition. They are all prepared – if necessary – to actively oppose the war instigators headed by American imperialism.

    Today, every Polish people commemorates the festival of national liberation, we should especially forcefully reiterate: Poland stands under the banner of proletarian internationalism and fights to defend peace.

　　人民波兰六年
    波兰人民共和国驻华大使  游·布尔金
    一九四四年七月二十二日，波兰人民开始了自己历史上的新阶段。这一天，在刚由苏联红军解放不久的波兰土地上，在一个不大的赫尔谟城里，波兰人民共和国宣告成立了。波兰人民政权用临时人民政府的名义在历史上第一次向本国人民和世界人民宣布，从今天起，自由的波兰劳动人民自己来决定自己的命运，要把资本家和地主在波兰的专制统治永远结束了。
    当广播、报纸和讲演传布着第一次人民波兰政府的历史性的宣言的时候，希特勒的威力已经受到粉碎性的打击，胜利的苏联红军很快地在全线推进，从法西斯瘟疫下解放了波兰土地。和苏联红军并肩前进，担任着解放自己的祖国的使命的，是在苏联人民和斯大林大元帅本人的帮助下建立起来的第一支波兰军师团。
    波兰人民到处热烈欢迎祖国的解放者苏联红军和波兰人民的子弟兵团与正规师团，这些人民的军队在战斗中一天天迅速地生长壮大起来，因为成千成万的被解放了的取得了自由生活的人们不断地补充到队伍中间。游击队队伍的成长不是以日计而是以小时计，他们就在对敌人的英勇战斗中，献身于人民解放的神圣事业。
    在战斗中，在血泊里，在坦克车的怒吼声中，在弥漫城市和乡村的烟雾里，在游击队足迹踏遍的森林中，在盖世太保拷问房牺牲者的呻吟下，在被破坏的集中营里，在从痛苦与死亡中被拯救出来的人们的欢乐声中——新的人民的波兰诞生了！
    恢复到旧的地位，那是永远不可能的事了。但是波兰人民在那个特别有意义的日子（七月二十二日）里，所做过的事，却在一切过去和一切未来的事情中，使我们最难忘却。这个恐怖的过去是波兰的劳动群众一分钟也没有忘记，而且将来永远忘不掉的。
    在战前，统治着波兰的是资本家、地主、以比尔苏德斯基为首的军国主义者、和帝国主义的从仆结合起来的法西斯集团。他们所压迫的不仅是波兰人民，同时还有在一九二○年从苏联手中强夺过去的土地上生活着的乌克兰人和白俄罗斯人。他们对国际帝国主义的密切关系，正同仆役对主人一样。他们准备了反对苏联的战争。在国际帝国主义反对社会主义国家的十字军中，他们还梦想完成充当先锋队这一种“历史使命”。
    当法国在资本主义欧洲称霸的时候，他们就在它的音乐声中舞蹈过。当通到欧洲帝国主义巡洋舰上去的资本主义桥梁，被德国大地主们占去的时候，他们又可耻地急忙转向为德国大地主们服务了。当刽子手希特勒的血手握到了警棍，向世界表明他在号召巩固正在崩溃中的资本主义统治的时候，波兰的资本家、地主和军国主义者们马上变为希特勒侵略者的合作者和忠仆了。
    由于死心地仇视苏联，由于害怕波兰人民群众的革命运动，他们完全投靠到希特勒的怀抱中去，并可耻地哀求希特勒允许他们和法西斯军队一道向东方进军。
    希特勒把波兰法西斯分子紧紧地抱在自己的怀里，甚至使他们透不过气来，要求出让波兰的领土，要求无条件的服从，这样就等于完全剥夺了波兰的独立。苏联曾向波兰建议两国互相帮助，一同反对希特勒的侵略军，可是波兰法西斯分子们却置之不理。接着意料中的事就发生了：一九三九年九月一日，德国法西斯军队从西、北和南三方面侵入波兰。
    人民拿起了武器。在战争爆发后的第四天，法西斯政府可耻地逃跑了，我们的士兵、工人和农民起来进行英勇的抵抗。共产党员首先表现了自己是祖国的自由和独立的保护者。但是，英雄主义和人民的坚决性，如果没有武装、组织，没有得到军事上的支持，那就不可能拯救波兰。一九三九年九月二十八日，洪水似的希特勒强盗的队伍出现在整个波兰。
    恐怖的希特勒占领军结束自己命运的日子开始了。
    斗争一瞬间也未停止过。为数众多的人民解放运动的和革命的组织在地下活动着。这种斗争是值得付出大量牺牲的代价的。
    希特勒匪徒们一意要把波兰变为法西斯德国的附庸。他们给“不服从的”波兰人民安排了死亡的定命，把波兰人民的土地强划给“有功劳的”法西斯分子所有。工厂、作坊在占领后也很迅速地被抢夺去了。
    敌人就这样地按照德国帝国主义的意志，进行着对波兰民族的分裂运动，这民族是有着自己数千年的历史，有着自己丰富的文化，有着为自己和其他民族的自由而斗争的优良传统的。由于波兰法西斯的罪恶的卖国政策，波兰人民遭受了如此的命运。
    但是，波兰人民有了伟大坚强的朋友苏联，也就把祖国从灭亡中拯救出来了。波兰的人民解放运动，一开始就得到了苏联人民的同情。当希特勒德国背信弃义、强盗似的进攻苏联的时候，波兰人民就站在社会主义国家方面。在希特勒统治的后方，波兰和苏联游击队的战斗的友谊是紧密地联系着的。在波兰的秘密环境里，组织了波兰的工人党，和党的武装——人民近卫军的队伍。在苏联，由于波兰主义者联盟的努力，波兰民主的最先进的人们，波兰共产党员得到了苏联政府的帮助，组织了新的人民波兰军。
    一师团跟着一师团开上前线，为了反对人类的共同敌人——希特勒主义，同苏联红军并肩作战。就这样又一次在波兰人民争取自由的斗争历史中，实现了我们旧有的军事口号：“争取我们的和你们的自由！”在这个口号下，波兰人为了争取自己的自由，以及争取别国人民的自由，一八四八年，曾经在匈牙利和奥地利，一九三六——三九年曾经在西班牙的内战里，一九四○——四五年曾经在法国人民解放斗争中，在遥远的挪威海峡里，在非洲火热的沙漠上，在烈日当空的意大利国土里，又在英国高出云际的高山上，都进行过战斗。但是这一次斗争，却不仅是为了争取波兰人民的解放，争取其他国家人民的解放，而且简直是为了争取波兰人民的生存。（⑴⑷）
    当斯大林军队同波兰军队并肩一起，以强大的力量，将希特勒匪徒们击退到维斯纳河的时候，可以说波兰大部分领土是解放了，七月二十二日的宣言能够成为有血有肉的现实生活了。
    农民分到了土地，国家接收了大小工厂——自然都是被炸坏被焚毁的——劳动者们自己组织了自己的生活，建立起一师团又一师团新的队伍。当时波兰的反动派，企图破坏祖国解放的伟大事业，曾经开始向人民军队的士兵射击，曾经同德国的占领者进行谈判。他们曾经阴谋过早地挑发起华沙的起义，使占领的匪徒们有毁灭整个首都的可能。
    华沙人民以无比的英勇，适时地同占领的匪徒们进行搏斗。纳粹的刽子手们和波兰的叛徒们执行了希特勒的命令：“毁灭华沙，毁灭一切种马铃薯的地方。”
    世界大战接近了末期。一九四五年一月，解放军的战士们以新的英勇的突击，一举解放了波兰其余的领土，并给予敌人以最后的打击，当时有五十万波兰军队参加了这光荣的战斗。
    华沙是解放了。
    但是有什么可宝贵的呢……
    波兰人口在战前有三千万，战后仅剩二千三百万。七百万人倒于战场，死于炸弹，死于枪弹，其中有在城市和乡村的街道上被枪杀的，有在盖世太保的地下室和集中营里被磨折死的，也有死于饥馑、疾病和苦难的。华沙，美丽的华沙，变成了一堆不成形的废墟、变成了三十万具尸体的巨大坟墓。格达斯科、士杰城、伏洛茨拉夫，及其他数十座城市，几千个乡村完全或几乎完全被铲平被烧光了。田野被掘成了战壕，森林被炮火摧毁得枝干零落。工厂到处受了严重的破坏。到处是坟墓，几万、几十万的坟墓。
    然而，苏联同我们站在一条战线，斯大林同我们站在一起。他帮助我们重新恢复我们的祖国，在我们最艰难的岁月，他就向我们伸出了援助之手。对于我们饥饿的人民他送来了面包，为了恢复我们的铁路干线，他送来了工具器材，为了清除我们被摧毁的城市，他送来了元锹、十字镐、机器，在人员方面给了我们更大的帮助，如派给我们的苏联人员：医生，工程师，熟练工人，管理信号专家等等。
    一九四七年，波兰开始很坚强地走上了恢复的道路。恢复波兰的三年计划开始实现了。一九四七、一九四八、一九四九这三个年头工业特别发展。这是对地主和资产阶级的残余，进行最尖锐的不可调和的阶级斗争的时期。这些地主和资本家们，在战前，把波兰出卖给法国，英国和德帝国主义者，在战时，强奸民意，企图粉碎民族解放斗争，继续诋毁苏联，而在战后，又转变为美国帝国主义的奴才。
    工人阶级和劳苦大众，在马列主义先锋队的领导下，粉碎了一切障碍，接二连三地获得了胜利。工农同盟巩固起来了，工人阶级的团结加强起来了。一九四八年十二月，由于两个工人政党团结的结果，在波兰共和国总统Ｂ·贝鲁特的领导下，产生了波兰统一工人党。
    由于同伟大苏联不可摧毁的同盟，并同各人民民主国家兄弟般的互助合作，人民的波兰以最高的速度走上了复兴的道路。
    劳动的人民，胜利地完成了自己的第一个三年计划。根据这个计划必须将波兰人民工业日用品的产量提高到战前水平百分之二二五，农业品产量提高到战前水平百分之一一○。这一些都如期地达到了目的。一九三八年，也就是大战开始的前一年，工业品的产量，仅占所有总产量的百分之三二，一九四八年升高到百分之五四，而在一九四九年，三年计划的最后一年，已到百分之六五·八。波兰不再是落后的农业国家了。一九四九年，三年计划快完成的时候，工业品产量，同一九三七年相比增高到百分之一七四。一九三八年在波兰发出电力为四十万万千瓦小时，而在一九四九年——八十万万。
    以上所引证的指示着已达到的成绩的那些数目字和材料，不能精确地叙述出全部的成就。这些数目字还不够说明无拘束的自由生活的美好意义，还不够说明脱离了鞭策的劳动人民所得到的新的感觉，还不够说明，认为自己是自己国家和自己生活的主人的劳动者们，在脱离饥饿威胁之后所怀抱的感情。这些数目字，不能描写出，在波兰史无前例的、在战胜旧剥削制度之后所产生的，新人的思想情绪。
    但是，凡经历过艰苦斗争的道路而得到胜利的群众，凡经历同波兰类似的苦难的各国人民，都是没有任何困难地会了解到这一切的。
    一九四九年末，我们完成了三年计划，作了建设社会主义基础的准备。关于这一点，波兰统一工人党第一届大会的决议，有如下的说明：
    “国家的政权，掌握在劳动人民的手中。
    人民经济的一切重要领导机构……都掌握在劳动人民的手中。
    波兰是以苏联为首的统一的反帝阵营组织中的一员，必须同苏联和人民民主国家，取得互助的密切联系，检讨已得的成就和国家经济中的各项转变。在这些条件下，波兰能够把艰巨的新任务放到自己的前面。”
    这个任务就是指建立社会主义的基础来说，也就是指六年计划政治经济的内容来说。
    在经济方面，要实现六年计划，必须达到：
    在工业方面，与一九四九年相比，产量增高到百分之二一四，一九五五年的工业产量，将三·五倍于一九三八年的产量。矿山和机械工业的产量更要提高——差不多较一九四九年增高三倍。冶金工业增产百分之一七一，而电气工业增产百分之二二七。
    在农业方面的产量，预计达到一九四九年的百分之一四五。只要加快建立集体农庄，同时充分采用进步的农业技术，并改善我国的农业技术，这个数字是可能达成的。到六年计划完成的时候，在我国农村经济中，集体农业就成为主要因素了。
    一九五五年的工业产量，将为我国总产量的百分之七四。由此可见，波兰到那时候，毫无疑问地将成为工业化的国家。
    一九四九年五月三十日，部长会议批准了六年计划的决议。当时波兰一切有阶级觉悟的人们都了解实现这个计划将有不少困难。但是从这时起，在国际舞台上，却发生了新的，非常重要的因素。在中国，伟大的革命胜利了。在越南、在印尼、在马来亚，展开了强大的民族解放运动。朝鲜人民为了反对美帝的侵略，正在胜利地战斗着。强大的和平阵营正在巩固着，发展着。这一切因素，都使我们的建设容易起来，使我们的前面展开了崭新的远景。
    假如，人民的波兰，期望着苏联和人民民主国家方面的支持和援助，那么，另一方面，波兰人民在进行全部的创造劳动的时候，也就应当考虑到给兄弟国家的人民以支持和援助。
    为了建立社会主义，必须很快地达到永久的和平。波兰人民从惨痛的教训，深深地了解战争的可怖，现在更认识到建设性的和平劳动的可贵。因此波兰是站在保卫和平的斗争队伍里最前列的一员，积极地进行着保卫和平的斗争。一千八百万波兰人，也就是全波兰的成年人民，都参加了斯德哥尔摩的和平签字。他们全体准备——假如需要的话——积极反对以美帝为首的战争挑拨者。
    在今天，每一个波兰人民纪念着民族解放的节日，我们应该特别有力地一再强调：波兰站在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜之下，为保卫和平而斗争。
