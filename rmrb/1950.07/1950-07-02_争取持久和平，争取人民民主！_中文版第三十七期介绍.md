Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 37 (Total Issue 76) has been published. The editorial in this issue, "Leninism and the Struggle of All Peoples for Peace" and Miting's article "The International Significance of Leninism," were written to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Lenin's birth. (Lenin was born on April 22, 1870.)

The editorial points out that all the achievements of the Soviet Union and the international revolutionary movement are built on the solid foundation of Leninism. Lenin's doctrine, developed by Comrade Stalin, shines like a powerful searchlight on the path of the working people's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. Under the current conditions where the struggle for peace is the central task of the Communist Party, Lenin's doctrine on war and peace is of utmost importance. After narrating Lenin's theory of the peaceful coexistence of two systems (referring to socialism and capitalism), the editorial points out that the foreign policy led by Stalin always adheres to Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence between the two systems. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is the best proof of the Soviet Union's loyalty to the cause of peace. However, the policies of the American and British imperialists are the opposite. They hate peace, and everything they are doing today is aimed at undermining peace and instigating new wars. The editorial states regarding today's movement to defend world peace: Peace can only be achieved by actively organizing all those who resent war to fight. Do not be afraid of the imperialists, because they are weaker than us. Because war threatens all honest people, it is necessary to resolutely draw the broadest masses of people in all countries into the struggle for peace. Mobilize all organizational structures and skillfully combine them, because the strength of the working class lies in organization. Such a powerful mass movement as the peace movement should not be allowed to drift. Only when all the people are particularly vigilant and resolutely use all forces and methods in the active struggle for peace can the sinister plans of the new warmongers be shattered.

Miting's article points out that for the people of the People's Democratic countries, Leninism illuminates the road to socialism, the road to prosperity, and the road to a happy and joyous life. For the Chinese Communist Party – the vanguard of the Chinese people – Leninism is truly a weapon and guide in thought. The article specifically points out: There is no doubt that in the near future, the liberated, working Chinese people will show the world miracles of labor, discipline, and organization, and will display unprecedented energy and talent; the impact of all this on the entire struggle of the anti-imperialist camp will be immeasurable.

The article "The Collapse of the Yugoslav Fascists' Plan to Subvert Foreign Governments" written by Laurent, published in this issue, exposes the espionage and sabotage activities carried out by the Tito gang in various People's Democratic countries. The article says: The Tito-American spy network, which spread out from Belgrade, engaged in sabotage activities in many countries. The Tito-American spies used various methods and means to infiltrate the working class and democratic movements. The Yugoslav embassies, consulates, commercial delegations, and press offices, in cooperation with the intelligence agencies of the United States and Britain, became organizers of Tito's propaganda and organizers of treasonous espionage activities within France, Italy, Britain, West Germany, Canada, Belgium, Australia, India, Egypt, and other countries. They published and distributed communiques, pamphlets, and leaflets, filled with the lies of the Yugoslav fascist bandit chiefs. Tito's "diplomats" often provided bourgeois newspapers and magazines with absurd reports about Yugoslav "socialist construction," and "conspiracies" of the Information Bureau. Representatives of the Tito gang recruited lackeys at various gatherings, banquets, and other "social occasions," and sent many people to Belgrade for training. When these trainees returned to their own countries, they all worked for Tito's propaganda. The article points out: Although the Tito group's sabotage conspiracies against foreign countries have been exposed and crushed, they have not given up their intention to infiltrate workers' and democratic organizations. Therefore, Communist and Workers' Parties must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance against manifestations of bourgeois nationalism, extremism, and Trotskyism.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第三十七期介绍
    【新华社二十八日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第三十七期（总第七十六期）已经出版。本期社论“列宁主义与各族人民争取和平的斗争”和米丁所写的“列宁主义的国际意义”一文，是为纪念列宁八十岁诞辰而写的。（列宁生于一八七○年四月二十二日。）
    社论指出：苏联和国际革命运动的一切成就都是建立在列宁主义坚强的基础上的。经过斯大林同志所发挥的列宁的学说，好像强烈的探照灯似地照耀着劳动人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的奋斗的道路。在目前以争取和平的奋斗为共产党的中心任务的条件下，有关战争与和平的列宁学说是有极重大的意义的。社论在叙述了列宁关于两种制度（指社会主义与资本主义）的和平相处的理论之后，指出：斯大林领导着的外交政策，永远遵守着列宁的两种制度和平相处的原则。苏联的外交政策成为苏联效忠于和平事业的最好证明。但美英帝国主义者的政策相反。他们憎恨和平，他们今天所做的一切都是指向破坏和平，指向掀起新的战争。社论在论到今天的保卫世界和平的运动时说：必须将一切愤恨战争的人积极组织起来进行斗争，和平才能实现。不要怕帝国主义者，因为他们比我们弱。因为战争威胁了一切正直的人民，所以要坚决地把一切国家内的最广大人民吸引到和平的斗争中来。把一切组织机构都发动起来，巧妙地结合它们，因为工人阶级的力量就在组织当中。像和平运动这样一种群众的有力的运动，是不应任其自流的。只有一切人民特别警惕，并且坚决地将一切力量和方法用在为和平的积极斗争上，才能粉碎新战争贩子的罪恶计划。
    米丁的文章指出：对人民民主国家的人民来说，列宁主义照亮了走向社会主义的道路，走向繁荣的道路，走向愉快幸福的生活的道路。对于中国共产党——中国人民的先锋队——来说，列宁主义真是思想上的武器和指南。该文特别指出说：毫无疑问，在不久的将来，解放了的、劳动的中国人民会向全世界表示出来劳动、纪律和组织的奇迹，会显示出史所未有的精力和才能；这一切对于反帝国主义阵营的全部斗争之进程的影响，将是难以估量的。
    该刊本期所发表的劳伦特所写的“南斯拉夫法西斯分子颠覆外国政府的计划垮台了”一文，揭露了铁托匪帮在各人民民主国家从事间谍破坏活动的情形。该文说：从贝尔格莱德展开的铁托——美国特务网，在许多国家里从事破坏工作。铁托——美国特务们利用各种方式与方法，钻进工人阶级和民主运动中去。南斯拉夫的大使馆、领事馆、商务代表团、新闻处，与美国及英国的情报机关共同合作，成为铁托宣传的组织者，成为法、意、英、西德、加、比、澳、印、埃及其他国家内部叛国间谍活动的组织者。他们出版并分送公报、小册子、传单，满篇都是南斯拉夫法西斯土匪头子的谰言。铁托的“外交官”经常把关于南斯拉夫“社会主义建设”、情报局“阴谋”等荒谬的报道供给资产阶级报章杂志。铁托匪帮的代表们在各种集会、宴会以及其他“应酬”上招募走卒，把许多人送到贝尔格莱德去受训。当这批受训者回到自己的国内时，都为铁托担任起宣传工作来。该文指出：虽然铁托集团对外国的破坏阴谋都已被揭露，被粉碎，但他们并不曾放弃钻进工人和民主组织的打算。因此共产党及工人党对于资产阶级民族主义、极端主义、托洛茨基派等表现，都得保持高度的革命警惕性。
