　　New Glass Factory, Su Xishan Successfully改造 a Pair of Pliers
    [Our Newspaper] Su Xishan, a technician at the Beijing New Glass Factory, responded to the factory's call to launch a new record movement. His research on改造冷却器的齐口钳 has been successful, making a significant contribution to improving product quality.
    The biggest problem in the current production of the New Glass Factory is the high rate of defective and finished product loss. According to statistics from the first quarter of this year, the loss rate reached 47.6% (including unavoidable losses in the production process). To address this, when the factory leadership arranged the creation of a new record movement in mid-June, they called on employees to use their brains, improve tools, reduce defective products, and improve quality. The employees responded enthusiastically to this call.
    In the past, the cooling devices made by the factory's instrument group had uneven pipe openings and insufficient roundness. The rubber stoppers either leaked water or air, and the delivered goods were often returned. Su Xishan, a technician in the group, was determined to improve the齐口钳. After more than twenty days of research, he tried to change the two iron clamp-shaped pliers into a cone in the middle that was the same thickness as the cooling device pipe, and into recessed edges on both sides. After thinking it over, he went to the factory director, You Qidong, to discuss it. Director You thought his idea made sense and agreed, saying: "You can try it!" Subsequently, Su Xishan took the drawing he had made to the mechanical room and had them make one according to the drawing. As a result, Su Xishan's research was successful! Using the newly made pliers, the pipe openings met the specifications, and the work efficiency was also improved. In the past, it took six minutes to齊 one opening, but now it can齊 three openings. This overcomes the shortcomings of water and air leakage, guaranteeing that the cooling devices will no longer be returned in the future due to non-compliance with specifications.

　　新建玻璃厂苏锡山改造齐口钳成功
    【本报讯】京市新建玻璃厂技工苏锡山响应该厂开展新纪录运动的号召，研究改造制冷却器的齐口钳已获成功，对提高产品质量贡献很大。
    新建玻璃厂当前生产中最大的问题是废品及成品的损失率太高，据今年第一季的统计，损失率达百分之四十七点六（包括生产过程不可免的损失）。为此，该厂领导方面在六月中旬布置创造新纪录运动时，即号召职工开动脑筋，改良工具，减少废品，提高质量。职工们热烈地响应了这个号召。
    该厂仪器组过去烧出来的冷却器，因管口大小不匀，圆度不够，按上皮塞不是漏水就是漏气，送出的货常被退回来。该组技工苏锡山便决心要改良齐口钳。经过了二十几天的钻研，他试着把两片铁夹子形的钳子，改成当中做成一个适合冷却器管子一般粗细的圆锥体，两边做成凹进去的棱角。他想好后，便去找厂长尤其侗商量。尤厂长认为他的说法有道理，就答应他说：可以试试看！随后苏锡山就拿着自己画的图样找到机械房，按图给他做了一把。结果苏锡山的研究成功了！用新做的钳子，管口合了规格，又提高了工作效率，过去六分钟只能齐一个口，现在能齐三个口了。这就克服了漏水漏气的缺点，保证了冷却器今后不会再因不合规格退货了。（京市新闻处季鸿）
