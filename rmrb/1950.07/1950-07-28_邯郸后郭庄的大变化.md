　　The Great Changes in Houguozhuang, Handan
    Gao Yongchang
    Houguozhuang is a small mountain village in Handan County, Hebei Province, with only fifty-three households. In the past, people in the surrounding villages had a saying: "Don't look for a girl in Houguozhuang, better to swallow chaff than eat vegetables." During the rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang bandits, the lives of the people in Houguozhuang were indeed very hard. Except for two landlord families in the village, no one else harvested enough grain to eat for more than two or three months. Eating chaff and vegetables was commonplace. In addition, due to years of looting and extortion by the Japanese devils, traitors, bandits, and Kuomintang bandits, eight out of ten families in the village were in debt with high interest. At that time, the whole village had only seven cattle and one mule. Due to the lack of means of production and indebtedness, farmers often sold their land. However, because the harvest was poor and the burden was heavy, some land was given away for nothing, and as a result, much farmland was left uncultivated. By the time of liberation, the village's land had decreased from 1,500 mu to 900 mu.
    In 1945, Handan was liberated, and the poor days of Houguozhuang came to an end. The Communist Party established an organization in Houguozhuang and led the masses to carry out land reform, struggling against the landlords Ge Butang and Ge Shengtang. At this time, although the masses had been allocated land, it was difficult to recover from years of poverty all at once. The higher-level Party committee, based on the actual situation of the village, instructed the branch to support agricultural production with sideline production. The Party members of the Houguozhuang branch, under the Party's cultivation and education, gradually improved their awareness and were determined to lead the villagers to develop production and embark on the road to prosperity. The branch studied the instructions of the Party committee and, based on the favorable conditions of Houguozhuang being close to coal mines in the west and the plains in the east, decided to organize the masses to engage in transportation, increase livestock from transportation, and drive agricultural production. They first mobilized the masses to organize on the basis of existing livestock and established a transportation mutual aid society. Households without livestock who were willing to engage in transportation could also participate. After the mutual aid society made profits from transportation, it would then help members without livestock to buy livestock according to the situation. In addition to the mutual aid society buying livestock, the branch also called on the masses to buy female animals to breed small livestock. In the past few years, the village has bred fifteen calves. In the past five years, the number of livestock in Houguozhuang has increased from eight to forty-eight (including twelve mules), and the poor quality cattle have been replaced with good quality cattle.
    After the number of livestock gradually increased, the branch mobilized the masses to buy sheep for fertilizer accumulation. At first, the masses felt it was troublesome: they couldn't afford to buy many, and it wasn't worth it to have someone graze just a few. Ge Denlin, the secretary of the branch, mobilized everyone to buy collectively and hire a shepherd together. He also explained the benefits of shearing wool, lambing, and accumulating fertilizer to everyone through accounting. However, some people still didn't believe it. At this time, Ge Denlin used the method of breaking through one point to drive the general situation to solve this problem. He organized several activists and first collected thirteen shares (130,000 yuan) and personally went to Zuoquan (Liao County), Shanxi, to buy back eighty-five sheep. When the masses saw the benefits, they all bought collectively. In the past few years, including breeding and purchasing, the village has had four flocks of sheep, with a total of more than 300 sheep. These flocks of sheep have increased a lot of income for the masses: they can accumulate more than 2,500 carts of fertilizer every year, and they can also shear a lot of wool and have a lot of lambs. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, everyone also carried out mutual assistance. Those with livestock hauled soil, and those without livestock prepared manure pits, so that everyone could accumulate sheep manure to enrich the land. During the slack season, the branch also called on the masses to scrape mountain slopes to press green manure, sweep leaves, and diligently pad livestock pens. In this way, the sheep and livestock together can accumulate more than 5,000 carts of fertilizer every year, which greatly increased the yield of the land.
    In terms of cultivation, the whole village has also truly achieved deep plowing and careful cultivation. Generally, the land has been plowed twice and harrowed five times, and the spring seedlings have been hoed four to five times, and the late seedlings have also been hoed three to four times. Some households have also bought fine fertilizer for the land with the money earned from transportation and breeding cattle and sheep. Now agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level by one time. Before the war, the average yield was two dou of grain per mu per season, which is equivalent to 50 jin; now each mu yields 100 jin. This year, the wheat harvest was reduced, but it still yielded 50 jin. The cultivated area has also been restored to 1,500 mu. Many of the past barren slopes and loamy land have been turned into fertile land as a result of deep plowing, careful cultivation, and the application of more fertilizer. However, the branch still has a major shortcoming in leading agricultural production, which needs to be improved urgently. In terms of agricultural mutual assistance, although the village has twelve mutual aid groups, wages are not calculated for non-uniform work in production, and everyone keeps their opinions to themselves. For example, during this year's wheat harvest, Jiao Wenyu (a Party member) harvested ten mu of wheat with one labor force, and his uncle's family also harvested ten mu of wheat with four labor forces. If this continues, it will be impossible to give full play to everyone's production enthusiasm, which will affect the further improvement of production.
    Production has increased, and life has become prosperous. The population of the village has also increased (people in the surrounding villages no longer say "don't look for a girl in Houguozhuang"). With the prosperity of both people and livestock, the masses are urgently feeling that the houses are not enough to live in. Last winter, the branch led the masses to jointly burn brick kilns. The branch convened a mass meeting through the village government to discuss the method of burning brick kilns. The masses who were willing to contribute money contributed money, those who were willing to haul coal hauled coal, and those with more labor participated in loading and unloading the kiln and cutting kiln firewood, all of which were evaluated and calculated as shares. Two kilns were burned in one winter, producing 80,000 bricks. The masses divided the bricks according to the amount of capital or labor they contributed. This spring, the branch led everyone to help each other build forty-eight new houses. The masses in the surrounding villages all said: "Houguozhuang is not the Houguozhuang of the past, that small village has become rich!" Compared to five years ago, the appearance of Houguozhuang has really changed greatly. Especially in summer, when you walk into this small village, you will see: livestock are tethered to the doors of every house, carts (vehicles used in mountainous areas) are placed, calves are running all over the streets, four flocks of sheep leave early and return late, plus forty or fifty new houses, and those farmers who are full of excitement and work hard. These new scenes after land reform will make you deeply rejoice and be encouraged by its brighter future.

　　邯郸后郭庄的大变化
    高永昌
    后郭庄是河北省邯郸县的一个小山村，全村只有五十三户人家。过去周围村庄的老百姓有句俗话：“有闺女甭寻（不嫁的意思）后郭庄，不吃菜就咽糠。”在日伪及国民党匪帮统治时代，后郭庄群众的生活确是够苦的。全村除两家地主外，谁家收的粮食也只够吃两三个月，吃糠咽菜自然是常事。加上鬼子、汉奸、土匪、国民党匪帮连年的抢夺敲诈，村子里十家就有八家借有高利贷。那时候全村只有七头牛、一头骡子，农民由于生产资料缺乏和负债，常常出卖土地。但是因为收成坏而且负担重，有些土地白送出去也没人要，因而不少耕地荒芜了。到解放时，全村土地已由一千五百亩减到九百亩。
    一九四五年邯郸解放了，后郭庄穷苦的日子到头了。共产党在后郭庄建立了组织，领导群众进行了土地改革，斗争了葛步堂葛升堂两家地主。这时群众虽分得了土地，但是多年来的贫困一下子很难恢复过来。上级党委根据该村实际情况，指示支部要以副业生产支持农业生产。后郭庄支部的党员在党的培养教育下，觉悟程度日渐提高，决心领导全村群众搞好生产，走上富裕的道路。支部研究了党委的指示，根据后郭庄西临煤矿、东近平原的有利条件，决定组织群众搞运输，从搞运输中增加牲口，带起农业生产。他们首先发动群众，在现有牲口的基础上组织起来，成立了运输互助社。没牲口户愿意搞运输的也可参加。在互助社运输得利后，再根据情况帮助社内无牲口户也买起牲口。除了互助社买牲口外，支部又号召群众买母畜繁殖小畜。这几年中全村已繁殖了十五头小牛。五年来，后郭庄的牲口已由八头增加到四十八头（其中骡子十二头），并把不好的牛换成了好牛。
    牲口逐渐增多后，支部又动员群众买羊积肥。起初群众感到麻烦：多了买不起，少了又占不住一个人去放。支部书记葛登林就动员大家合伙买，合伙雇羊工喂养。并把剪羊毛、下小羊、积肥等好处用算账方式算给大家听。但是有些人还是不相信。这时葛登林便运用突破一点带动一般的方法来解决这个问题。他组织了几个积极分子，先集了十三股（十三万元），亲自到山西左权（辽县）去买回八十五只羊。群众看见有利就都合伙买起来。几年来，连繁殖带购买，全村已有四群羊，共三百多只。这几群羊给群众增加了不少收入：每年能积二千五百车肥，还能剪很多羊毛，下很多小羊。在积肥方面，大家也进行了互助，有牲口的拉土，没牲口的垫圈，使大家都能积下羊肥去壮地。在农间时支部又号召群众刮山坡压绿肥、扫树叶，勤垫牲口圈，这样连羊带牲口每年全村能积五千多车肥，大大提高了土地产量。
    在耕作方面，全村也真正做到了深耕细作。一般土地都做到了犁二耙五，春苗锄到四至五遍，晚苗也都锄到三、四遍。有些户还把运输和繁殖牛羊挣下的钱买成细肥上地。现在农业生产已超过战前水平一倍。战前每亩每季平均二斗谷，合五十市斤；现在每亩收一百斤。今年麦子减收，也还收到五十市斤。耕地面积也已恢复到一千五百亩。许多过去的岗坡壤地，由于深耕细作多上肥的结果，也都变成了肥沃良田。但是支部在农业生产的领导上，还有一大缺点，急待改进。在农业互助上，该村虽有互助组十二个，但在生产中不齐工不算账，大家有意见都闷在肚子里。如今年麦收时焦文玉（党员）一个劳力割十亩麦子，他大伯家里四个劳力也是割十亩麦子。这样下去就无法发挥大家的生产积极性，将使生产进一步的提高受到影响。
    生产提高了，生活富裕了。村里的人口也增加了（周围村庄的人再也不说“有闺女不寻后郭庄”了）。在人畜两旺的情况下，群众迫切感到房子不够住。去年冬天，支部就领导群众合伙烧砖窑。支部通过村政府召开群众大会，讨论了烧砖窑的办法。群众愿拿钱的拿钱，愿拉炭的拉炭，劳力多的参加装出窑和割窑柴，一律按工评价算股。一冬天烧了两座窑，出了八万砖。群众根据所出的资金或出工多少分了砖。今春支部又领导大家互助盖新房四十八间。周围村庄的群众都说：“后郭庄可不是过去的后郭庄啦，那个小村可发啦！”假如比起五年前，后郭庄的样子真是大变了。特别是夏天，当你走进这个小村子时就会看到：家家门口拴着牲口，放着小车（山地用的车子），小牛犊满街跑，四群羊早出晚归，再加上四、五十间新房子，和那些满怀兴奋辛勤操作的农民，这些土地改革后的新气象，会使你深深地为它的更光明的远景而感到欢欣鼓舞的。
