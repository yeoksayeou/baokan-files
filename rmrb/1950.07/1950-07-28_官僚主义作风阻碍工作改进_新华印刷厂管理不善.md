　　Bureaucratic Style Hinders Work Improvement
    Poor Management at Xinhua Printing Factory
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Lan Cun reports: The Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory has been established for over a year, but due to the bureaucratic and事務ist work style of the administrative leading cadres, and the failure of the Party and the trade union to function, production has not yet gotten on the right track. The factory is under the leadership of the Publishing Bureau of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration and has more than 700 workers. The factory has significant equipment for letterpress printing, offset printing, and photo-engraving. This factory was the "Xinmin Printing House" under the rule of the enemy and puppets. Before the liberation of Beijing, it was severely damaged by the Chiang bandits, and important machinery and buildings were completely burned down. After the People's Government took over, the dispatched factory director led the workers in active efforts to rebuild the factory from the rubble. Now it can typeset more than six million characters and print 7,000 reams of paper per month.

    The Factory Director is a "Good Old Man" Constantly Busy with Affairs
    Factory director Zhou Yongsheng is seen by the workers as a "good old man." He usually sits in the office, busy with事務al work. For example, if workers want to borrow rice, he has to stamp it; if the general affairs section buys two flashlights, he has to sign it. But he rarely goes deep into the grassroots to understand and study the production situation. Various systems within the factory are extremely unsound. There is isolation between superiors and subordinates. The workers' suggestions and opinions on production cannot be promptly answered and resolved. The most important production unit in the factory, the letterpress printing section, has been in chaos since its section chief was transferred to study, and the administration appointed three people to be temporarily responsible. The three of them are not clear about their specific tasks and push responsibility to each other when things happen, causing the work of the letterpress printing section, which includes more than 140 people, to fall into chaos. The workers in this section urgently demand improvement in leadership. Although the administration has conducted several education sessions for the three of them, the effect has not been great.

    In March of this year, the factory held a workers' representative meeting. Before the meeting, the workers had raised more than 100 suggestions for improving the work. Although the administration answered these opinions at the meeting and partially handed them over to various units for adoption and implementation, due to the lack of system guarantees and the failure to conduct inspections, most of the good suggestions have not been truly put into practice. The workers feel that making suggestions is useless, and they no longer make them.

    The Trade Union Organization Does Not Function, Workers Feel It is Dispensable
    What about the trade union? In addition to running spare-time schools and organizing cultural and recreational activities for a few people, it rarely leads production. In April of this year, the workers proposed launching a production competition campaign. For this central task of the entire factory, the trade union leader, along with the competition committee organized by the Party, the government, the trade union, and the Youth League, did not go deep into the site for specific guidance during the more than one-month competition. Workers were not given timely encouragement or criticism on who was doing well or poorly in production. This made the workers' original full enthusiasm for production slowly cool down. It was not until the end of the competition that a competition team leader was selected in each section to conduct a product inspection.

    Usually, the trade union director is also busy with事務al affairs and does not easily go to the workers; moreover, he has not done a good job of uniting the trade union committee members and team leaders to give play to the trade union's leadership role. Therefore, the workers believe that the trade union is dispensable, and the trade union team leaders only know how to collect membership dues.

    The Party Organization Has Not Been Publicized, Nor Has It Developed New Party Members
    The secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch in the factory is concurrently held by the factory director, forming a situation where the Party and government are not separated; the Party's work is reduced to a secondary position. The Party organization has not yet been publicized. The branch's education for Party members is very poor. In the past year or so, not a single new Party member has been developed.

    Since the leadership style of the Party, government, and trade union in the factory is as described above, the result is that several leaders are high above, busy and busy, and no one can tell what problems exist in production.

    Materials are Available for Use at Any Time, Lacking Systems, Production Pioneers Are Not Valued
    The main problems that can be seen now are: First, serious waste in production. The system for issuing and distributing materials is extremely unsound, and there is no strict responsibility system. Damaged paper can be exchanged for good ones, and machine oil can be collected at any time. Some units put the materials back in a pile after collecting them, and the workers take them at will. Since the establishment of the factory, it is difficult to imagine how much waste there has been. What can be counted is: on one occasion, when printing picture albums for a certain department, two reams of paper (a total of one thousand sheets) were ruined. Recently, when printing the CPPCC commemorative publication, another five reams of eighty-pound Daolin paper were wasted, worth ten million yuan (although this was mainly due to the Publishing Bureau's changing of the layout, the quality of the ink selected by the factory in advance was not good enough, and the amount of paper wasted in printing was also not small). At the same time, because the various production units and the material purchasing unit have not established close contact in establishing a system, a large amount of waste often occurs when materials are bought back because they are not suitable. In addition, a lot of working hours are wasted because the machine is broken and cannot be repaired in time or the materials cannot be supplied in time. Second, the creativity of the workers cannot be fully developed. For example, the workers in the type-casting section have created a method of installing small wheels on the universal type-casting machine, which improves work efficiency, but has not received appropriate commendation. Li Chunyang, a worker in the binding section, improved the cutting method for 25-open pages, which doubled the work efficiency, but was not even praised once in the wall newspaper. In this production competition, the hardcover team automatically established a system of ordering personal plans, mutual supervision and inspection, etc., which increased the output by 50%. Such an advanced production method was not discovered by the leadership during the competition. It was not until recently that the production competition work was summarized that some material rewards were given.

    Regarding the above-mentioned problems, the factory leadership made some self-criticism in last year's work summary, but so far they have not come up with effective solutions. The key issue for improving work in the future is that the Party, government, and trade union should thoroughly change their past leadership styles, establish a view of relying on workers and doing a good job in production, and organize the factory management committee as soon as possible to thoroughly rectify the factory from the aspects of organizational structure, systems, and personnel, and change the current situation.

    In addition, the production tasks given to the factory by the Publishing Bureau in the past did not have a fixed plan, which caused the factory's production to be tight and loose at times, which also added objective difficulties to the factory's improvement of production. In the future, the Publishing Bureau's production leadership of the factory should also be improved.

### 官僚主义作风阻碍工作改进  新华印刷厂管理不善

　　官僚主义作风阻碍工作改进
    新华印刷厂管理不善
    【本报讯】记者蓝村报道：京市新华印刷厂建厂一年余，由于行政领导干部有官僚主义、事务主义作风，以及党和工会不起作用，致使生产还未走上正轨。该厂属中央人民政府出版总署出版局领导，现有工人七百余人；铅印、胶印、照像制版等设备，均具有相当大的规模。该厂在敌伪统治时代是“新民印书馆”，北京解放前，惨遭蒋匪破坏，重要机器与房屋全被烧毁，人民政府接管后，经派去的厂长领导工人积极努力，使该厂从瓦砾堆中重建起来。现在每月能排六百多万字、印刷七千令纸。
    厂长是“老好人”整天忙于事务
    厂长周永生在工人的眼里是“老好人”。平日坐在办公室，忙于事务工作。如工人借米要他盖章，总务科买两个电筒也要他签名，却很少深入下层了解和研究生产情况。厂内各种制度极不健全。上下隔绝。工人们对生产提出的建议和意见，得不到及时的答复和解决。该厂最重要的生产单位铅印股，自股长调出学习后，行政方面指定了三个人临时负责。他们三人不清楚具体任务，有事就互相推诿，致包括一百四十余人的铅印股的工作陷于混乱。该股工人迫切要求改进领导。行政方面虽对他们三人进行过几次教育，但收效不大。
    今年三月间，该厂开过一次职工代表会议。会前，工人们曾提出了一百多条有关改进工作的意见。对这些意见，行政方面虽在会上作过答复，并部分地交各单位采纳实施，但因缺乏制度的保证，又不进行检查，以致大部分好的意见并没有真正见诸实行。工人们觉得提意见不顶事，以后也就不再提了。
    工会组织不起作用工人觉得可有可无
    工会呢？除办理业余学校和组织少数人的文娱活动以外，很少领导生产。今年四月，工人们提议发动生产竞赛运动，对于这个全厂的中心工作，工会负责人除在大会上作了一般的号召外，一个多月的竞赛中，以工会主任为首，由党、政、工、团所组织的竞赛委员会，并没有深入现场具体领导。工人们在生产上谁好谁坏，得不到及时的鼓励或批评。这就使得工人原先饱满的生产热情，慢慢冷了下来。直到竞赛末期，才在各股选出一个竞赛小组长，进行了一次产品检查。
    平时工会主任也忙于事务，不轻易到工人中去；更没有很好地团结各工会委员及小组长来发挥工会的领导作用。因此工人们认为工会可有可无，工会小组长只会收会费。
    党组织还没有公开也没发展过新党员
    该厂中共党的支部书记是厂长兼任，形成党政不分；党的工作被降到次要地位。党组织至今尚未公开。支部对党员教育很差，一年多以来，没有发展过一个新党员。
    该厂党、政、工的领导作风既如上述，结果造成几个领导人高高在上，忙忙碌碌，生产上究竟存在什么问题，谁也说不出来。
    材料随时领用缺乏制度生产先进者们未被重视
    现在可以看得出的主要问题是：第一，生产上的严重浪费现象。领发材料制度极不健全，又没有严格的负责制，纸张印坏了可以换好的，机油可以随时领取，有的单位把材料领回来放在一堆，工人随手取用。建厂以来，究竟有多大浪费，很难想象。可以计数的就有：某次给某部印画报，印坏了两令纸（共一千张）。最近印政协纪念刊，又浪费了八十磅道林纸五令，价值一千万元（这次虽主要是出版局改换版样所致，但该厂事先所选油墨质量不够精良，印废的纸张也不在少数）。同时，因为各生产单位与采购材料单位，没有从建立制度上取得密切联系，常常发生买回材料因不适用而大批浪费。此外，因机器坏了不能及时修理或材料不能及时供应，也浪费了不少工时。第二，工人的创造性不能充分发挥。例如铸字股工人，创造万能铸字机上安装小轮子的办法，提高了工作效率，但未得到适当的表扬。装订股工人李春阳改进了二十五开页子的切裁法，使工作效率提高一倍，却连墙报上也未表扬过一次。这次生产竞赛中，精装组自动建立了订个人计划，互相督促检查等制度，使产量提高了百分之五十。这样先进的生产方法，竞赛中就未被领导上发现。直到最近总结了生产竞赛工作。才给予一些物质奖励。
    上述问题，该厂领导方面在去年工作总结中曾作了部分检讨，但迄今仍未想出有效的克服办法。今后改进工作的关键问题，是党、政、工应彻底改变过去的领导作风，建立起依靠工人，搞好生产的观点，尽快地组织起工厂管理委员会，将工厂从组织机构、制度、人事各方面来一个彻底整顿，改变现在的局面。
    另外，出版局过去给予该厂的生产任务，没有一定计划，致该厂的生产时紧时松，也给该厂改进生产增加了客观的困难。今后出版局对该厂的生产领导，也应加以改进。
