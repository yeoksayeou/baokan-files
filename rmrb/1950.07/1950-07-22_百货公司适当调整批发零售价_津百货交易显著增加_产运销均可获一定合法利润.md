　　Department Store Appropriately Adjusts Wholesale and Retail Prices
    Tianjin Department Store Transactions Increase Significantly
    Production, Transportation, and Sales Can All Obtain Certain Legal Profits
    [Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: Tianjin Municipal Department Store, in accordance with the spirit of considering both public and private interests, taking into account the certain profits of producers, transporters, and sellers, and promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, implemented a general adjustment of retail and wholesale prices in June. Now the distance between the company's retail and wholesale prices is generally around 7 percent, which basically conforms to the spirit of the decision of the Central Trade Department. In June, the market transactions and regional sales of department store products increased daily with the adjustment of prices. In June, the company's total wholesale value increased by 36 percent compared with May. In terms of purchasing: In June, the company purchased department store commodities worth over 32.4 billion yuan in the city through processing, ordering, exchanging, and purchasing. Purchasing objects: In terms of public and private, state-owned factories and businesses accounted for over 9.8 billion yuan, accounting for more than 30 percent of the total purchase value, and private factories and businesses accounted for over 22.5 billion yuan, accounting for more than 69 percent; in terms of industry and commerce, factories accounted for over 24.4 billion yuan, accounting for more than 75 percent, and businesses accounted for over 7.9 billion yuan, accounting for more than 24 percent.
    In addition, the company, despite its own insufficient funds, vigorously carried out distribution business to assist factories in selling their products. In June, a total of 195 factories established distribution relationships with the company, an increase of 18 compared with May. At the same time, the distribution business was gradually expanded from simple retail to allocation and wholesale, and the handling fee was reduced from 7-8 percent in the past to 5-6 percent. The company's total distribution amount for the whole month was over 2 billion yuan, more than double that of May.
    As a result of improving public-private relations, the production of private factories and businesses has been strongly supported. For example, more than a dozen companies, such as Asia Factory, Kuiji Clothing Factory, and Daxin Striped Cloth Factory, have been able to maintain normal production due to the company's purchases, and some have added machines. In addition, some factories that had already suspended work, such as Kangle Cigarette Factory, Xinguang Ball Factory, and Jihua Soap Factory, have gradually resumed work after the company acquired and sold them on consignment, and some have been able to work day and night. For some factories whose production is not suitable for the needs of the masses or whose product quality is poor, the company has also provided opinions through acquisitions to guide them to improve production.

　　百货公司适当调整批发零售价
    津百货交易显著增加 
    产运销均可获一定合法利润
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：津市百货公司根据公私兼顾精神，照顾生产、运销者的一定利润，促进城乡物资交流，在六月份曾将零售、批发价格实行普遍调整。现在公司零售批发售价距离，一般均在百分之七左右，基本上符合中央贸易部决定的精神。六月份百货产品的市场交易和地区运销，均随价格的调整逐日增加。六月份该公司批发总值较五月份增加了百分之三十六。在进货方面：六月份该公司通过加工、订货、换货、收购等方式，在全市采购百货商品共值三百二十四亿余元。采购对象：以公私论，公营厂商共九十八亿余元，占收购总值百分之三十强，私营厂商共二百二十五亿余元，占百分之六十九强；以工商论，工厂共二百四十四亿余元，占百分之七十五强，商业共七十九亿余元，占百分之二十四强。
    此外，该公司又在本身资金不足的情况下，大力开展经销业务，协助工厂推销产品。六月份与该公司建立经销关系的工厂共一百九十五家，较五月份增加十八户，同时并将经销业务由单纯零售逐步扩展至调拨和批发方面，手续由过去的百分之七十八降低到百分之五十六。该公司全月经销总额为二十亿余元，较五月份增加一倍以上。
    由于改善公私关系的结果，有力扶持了私营厂商的生产，如亚洲工厂、魁记衣厂、大新条布厂等十余家，因该公司的收购均得保持正常生产，有的并增添了机器。此外有些已经停工的如康乐烟厂、新光球厂、辑华皂厂等经该公司收购代销已渐次复工，有的并已能昼夜开工生产。对一些生产不适合群众需要或产品质量较次的工厂，公司亦曾通过收购提供意见，指导其改进生产。
