　　Improving Knitwear Quality and Reducing Costs
    Beijing Prepares to Establish Knitwear Dyeing and Finishing Company
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The preparatory committee for the Beijing Knitwear Dyeing and Finishing Joint Stock Company was established on July 8th with the assistance of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. This company is a new type of enterprise, initiated by the preparatory committee of the Beijing Xingye Company and jointly organized with the knitwear industry in the city. The initial estimated capital is 1.5 billion yuan. The purpose of establishing this company is to improve the quality of knitwear products in Beijing, standardize specifications, and assist factories in improving technology and reducing costs. There are more than 700 knitwear factories in Beijing (mainly producing socks), most of which are small factories or workshops with simple equipment and lacking glazing and finishing departments. Moreover, the product specifications are inconsistent, and sales in Beijing are minimal, requiring sales to be pushed in the Northwest. To solve this problem, the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference passed a resolution in February this year requesting the government to assist in establishing a knitwear dyeing and finishing factory. However, this has not been realized due to a lack of funds. After the establishment of the Beijing Xingye Company Preparatory Committee, it will first promote this work. The main equipment of the knitwear dyeing and finishing company will include six glazing machines, twenty-four toe-closing machines, and five "汽汀" machines (each with twenty-four sock boards). Recently, people were sent to Shanghai to purchase machines, and it is expected that the factory will be officially established in early September. The preparatory committee consists of ten members, with Ji Zengshou, chairman of the Knitwear Industry Association, as the chairman.

　　提高针织品质量减低成本
    京筹设针织染烫公司
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市针织染烫股份有限公司筹委会经市工业局和工商联合会的协助，已于七月八日成立。这个公司是一个新型的企业，由北京市兴业公司筹委会发起，并联合本市针织业共同组织，资金初步预定为十五亿元。这个公司设立的目的，是提高北京市针织业产品的质量，划一规格，并协助各厂改进技术，减低成本。北京市现有针织工厂七百多家（以织袜子为主），多是小型工厂或手工作坊，设备简陋，缺少上光和整装部门，而且产品规格不一，本市销售很少，只能到西北各地去推销。为了解决这个问题，今年二月市各界人民代表会议第二届第二次会议上，曾通过请政府协助设立针织染烫工厂的决议。但因缺乏资金迄未实现。北京市兴业公司筹委会成立后，将首先推动了这一工作。针织染烫公司主要的设备将有上光机六台、缝尖机二十四台、汽汀机五台（每台有二十四支袜板）。最近就派人到上海购买机器，预计九月初正式设厂。筹委共十人，由针织业公会理事长冀增寿为主委。
