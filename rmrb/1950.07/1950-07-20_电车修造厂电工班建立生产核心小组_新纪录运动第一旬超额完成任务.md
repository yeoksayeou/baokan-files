　　Electric Trolley Repair Factory Electrician Team Establishes Production Core Group
    First Ten Days of New Record Movement Exceed Task
    [Our Newspaper] The Electric Trolley Repair Factory's electrician team has established a production core group, giving full play to the wisdom of the masses. Since the launch of the "July 1st" New Record Movement, the team has exceeded its assigned tasks by 37% in ten days. In the past, the team's work was the responsibility of the foreman, but the foreman was afraid to make decisions alone. It was difficult to get results even when consulting with everyone. One piece of work was hesitated over and delayed a lot of time. This time, in order to respond to the New Record Movement, the team decided to form a core group consisting of the foreman and three production team leaders to lead the work of the entire team. Of the four people in this core group, one is a Party member and one is a League member. They began on June 20th and actively carried out all the necessary work to do a good job in the New Record Movement. They first carefully drew up a production plan. The team has three groups: roller, coil, and wire bundling, and their main task is to repair DC motors. In the past, there was often no work, and production exceeded the quota very little in May and June. In this situation, the core group of the team found a large number of discarded wire bundles in the warehouse and proposed to use them to wrap silk strips (silk strips wrapped with discarded wire bundles are both economical and durable) and to make mica paper themselves (in the past, the glued mica paper bought from outside was very expensive. The mica paper they made themselves only cost one-tenth of the market price). The core group also led and mobilized the masses to discuss the plan and the masses themselves set labor discipline and product quality standards. Secondly, the core group combined the New Record Movement to organize youth workers to study. They also studied ways to hold production team meetings well. In the past, the electrician team held workshop production meetings. There were too many people, and speeches were not enthusiastic. Most of the information was conveyed by the team leaders. The team leaders were very distressed. This time, they decided to separate the three groups. The team leaders first met to study the key points of the meeting. As a result, each meeting was very lively. On the 8th, at the team meeting, when the challenge was raised, the coil team had not dismissed the meeting two hours after work. Individuals and individuals, groups and groups all launched challenges, and the whole team challenged outside teams, which greatly encouraged production enthusiasm.

　　电车修造厂电工班建立生产核心小组
    新纪录运动第一旬超额完成任务
    【本报讯】京电车修造厂电工班建立了生产核心小组，发挥了群众智慧。该班自从“七一”新纪录运动开展后，十天中已超过了应完成任务的百分之三十七。过去该班的工作由领班负责，但领班遇事不敢单独决定，找大家商量，也很难得到结果。一件工作犹疑不定，耽误很多时间。此次该班为了响应新纪录运动，决定由领班和三个生产小组长组成核心小组，领导全班工作。这个核心小组的四人中有一个党员，一个团员。他们由六月二十日开始。积极地为了做好新纪录运动而进行各项必要的工作。他们首先缜密订出了生产计划。该班共有滚子、线圈、把线三个小组，主要工作是修直流电动机。过去常无工作，五六月份生产超额很少。在这样情况下，该班核心小组发现库房存有大批废把线，即提出以此缠绸条（用废把线缠的绸条既节约又耐久）并自制云母纸的工作计划（过去在外边买的粘好的云母纸，价钱很贵。他们自制的只合市价的十分之一）。核心小组又领导与发动群众讨论了计划，并群众自己订下了劳动纪律与生产品的规格标准。其次核心小组并结合新纪录运动组织青工学习。他们又研究了开好生产小组会的办法。过去电工班是开车间生产会议。人多，发言不踊跃，多是小组长传达。小组长很苦恼。这次他们决定三组分开。小组长先碰头研究开会的重点。结果每次开会都非常热烈。八日，小组会上，提出挑战时，线圈组下班后两小时还未散会。个人与个人，组与组都发起了挑战，全班又向外班挑战，这样就大大地鼓舞了生产热情。
