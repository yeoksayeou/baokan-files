Xinhua News Agency, 21st. In order to meet the needs of national key construction, the State Council of the Central People's Government is now comprehensively allocating this year's summer graduates from national universities.

According to existing statistics, the total number of students graduating this summer from public and private universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools nationwide (including universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools, but excluding Renmin University of China, Military and Political University, and higher education institutions led by the People's Government and the business departments of national economic organs) is 17,539. The actual needs of national construction far exceed this number. In order to plan and rationally allocate this year's graduates, adapt to the needs of national key construction (currently the Northeast) and the business needs of various regions and departments, and prevent confusion and uneven distribution, the State Council of the Central People's Government established the "1950 Summer Higher Education Graduates Work Allocation Committee" on June 3rd to directly handle the allocation of this year's summer graduates from national universities.

Under the leadership of the "Allocation Committee," this year's graduates from national universities will be subject to comprehensive adjustment and allocation according to the following situations: (1) All 530 graduates from the Northeast region will remain in the region, and another 4,900 to 6,200 graduates will be allocated to the region from East China, Central South, and Southwest regions. (2) More than 2,400 graduates from the North China region will be directly allocated by the Central Government, with 1,200 to 1,400 allocated to various Central Government agencies. The remaining portion will be allocated to the five provinces and two municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. (3) More than 6,400 graduates from the East China region, except for 2,600 to 3,300 who will remain in the region, 500 to 800 will be allocated to the Central Government (with at least 300 graduates in science and engineering), and 2,500 to 3,000 will be allocated to the Northeast region (with 1,500 to 1,900 graduates in science and engineering). (4) More than 3,900 graduates from the Central South region, except for 1,400 to 2,000 allocated to the Northeast region (with at least 900 graduates in science, engineering, and agriculture), will be handled by the region itself. (5) More than 3,400 graduates from the Southwest region, except for 1,000 to 1,200 allocated to the Northeast region (with at least 600 graduates in science and engineering), will be handled by the region itself. (6) More than 680 graduates from the Northwest region will be handled entirely by the region itself.

Now, the "Allocation Committee" has actively launched its work and established three working groups. One group is dispatched to East China to receive graduates allocated to the Central Government and assist the Northeast region in receiving graduates in the East China region. One group is responsible for the allocation of work for various Central Government agencies. One group is responsible for the allocation of work for the five provinces and two municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In addition, major administrative regions have also organized allocation committees to handle the allocation of work for this year's summer graduates from universities in their respective regions. The Northeast region has also sent people to East China, Central South, and Southwest to receive graduates allocated to the region.

After the allocation of university graduates, the general rule is to have a probationary period of six months to one year. During the probationary period, if the work unit is on a supply system, it will be handled according to the large canteen standard; if the work unit is on a wage system, wages will be paid according to the actual income of the large canteen standard or low wages will be paid according to local conditions. Generally, graduates should be persuaded to obey the government's allocation and serve the people. Those who express their willingness to find jobs on their own can be allowed to handle it themselves.

Among the 17,539 university graduates awaiting allocation this summer, there are 4,509 in engineering, 1,382 in science, 1,414 in agriculture, 1,072 in medicine, 3,352 in literature and education, 4,348 in law, 425 in finance and economics, and 507 in other fields. There are also 530 graduates from the Northeast region whose majors are unknown. The specific allocation work in North China began at the beginning of this month and can be largely completed before August. In order to take care of the needs of private enterprises, private industrial and commercial enterprises and cultural and educational undertakings in various places, if they need university graduates but cannot solve the problem themselves, they may apply to local governments for allocation.

　　全国高等学校本届毕业生
    政务院统筹分配工作
    全部一万七千余人将按国家重点
    建设及各地各部门之需要合理分配
    【新华社二十一日讯】为适应国家重点建设需要，中央人民政府政务院现正统筹分配全国高等学校今年暑期毕业学生。
    根据现有统计，全国公、私立高等学校（包括大学、独立学院及专科学校，但人民革命大学、军政大学和人民政府和国家经济机关各业务部门领导的高等学校不在内）今年暑期毕业学生共一万七千五百三十九人，而国家建设的实际需要，远远超过这数字。中央人民政府政务院为有计划地和合理地分配本届毕业生，以适应国家重点建设（目前是东北）及各地区各部门业务上的需要，并防止在分配中发生混乱偏枯等现象，特于六月三日成立“一九五○年暑期高等学校毕业生工作分配委员会”，直接办理全国高等学校今年暑期毕业学生工作分配事宜。
    在“分配委员会”领导下，全国高等学校今年毕业学生将按下列情况作统筹的调剂分配：（一）东北区毕业生五百三十名全留该区，并另由华东、中南、西南各区分配给该区四千九百名至六千二百名毕业生。（二）华北区毕业生二千四百余名，由中央直接分配，内一千二百名至一千四百名分配给中央各机关。其余部分分配给中央直属的五省二市及内蒙自治区。（三）华东区毕业生六千四百余名，除二千六百名至三千三百余名留归该区外，分配给中央五百名至八百名（内理、工科毕业学生最少三百名），分配给东北区二千五百名至三千名（内理、工科毕业生一千五百名至一千九百名）。（四）中南区毕业生三千九百余名，除分配给东北区一千四百名至二千名（内理、工、农科毕业生最少九百名）外，余由该区自行处理。（五）西南区毕业生三千四百余名，除分配给东北区一千名至一千二百名（内理、工科毕业生最少六百名）外，余由该区自行处理。（六）西北区毕业生六百八十余名，全部由该区自行处理。
    现在“分配委员会”已积极展开工作，并分别成立了三个工作组，一组派往华东接收分配给中央的毕业生并协助东北区在华东区的接收工作，一组负责对中央各机关的分配工作，一组负责对中央直属五省二市及内蒙自治区的分配工作。此外各大行政区也都组织了分配委员会，负责处理各该区高等学校今年暑期毕业学生工作分配；东北区并已派人分赴华东、中南、西南接收分配给该区的毕业学生。
    高等学校毕业生分配工作后，一般规定以半年至一年为见习期限。在见习期限内的待遇，其工作机关为供给制者，按大灶标准办理；其工作机关为工资制者，依大灶标准的实际所得发给工资或按当地情况发给低薪。对毕业学生，一般地应说服他们听从政府的分配，为人民服务。其表示愿自找职业者，可听由自行处理。
    今年暑期待分发工作的高等学校毕业生一万七千五百三十九人中，计包括工科四千五百零九人，理科一千三百八十二人，农科一千四百一十四人，医科一千零七十二人，文教科三千三百五十二人，法科四千三百四十八人，财经科四百二十五人，其他五百零七人，另有东北区的五百三十名毕业生科系不详。华北区的具体分配工作已于本月初开始，八月以前可大体分配完毕。为照顾私营企业需要各地私人经营的工商企业及文教事业，如需要高等学校毕业学生而本身无法解决时，得向各地政府申请分配。
