　　Polish People Support the Korean People's Struggle
    Beirut Speech Condemns American Aggression Against Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 15th] The Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, 15th, reports: Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, in a speech delivered on July 15th at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, stated: "Comrades, as the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee begins its discussions, we must first discuss and focus on a globally significant fact – namely, the illegal, barbaric, and rapacious aggression of American imperialism against the heroic Korean people. American imperialism has shamelessly violated all principles of law and all international principles of coexistence that should apply to a nation that has not harmed the interests of any country. It has launched a bloody and brutal war of aggression in Korea and mobilized all the capitalist countries it controls to participate in the war. In this way, with extreme disregard for all humanitarian principles, capitalism, led by American imperialism, has exposed its plundering and insatiable face to the world. The United States and those capitalist countries are directing warships to bombard the Korean coast, dropping thousands of bombs over undefended Korean cities, slaughtering residents, and brutally setting fire to and destroying a country that has done them no harm. What crime have the Korean people committed in the eyes of these countries? Like other peoples, their only crime is striving for freedom and independence.
    For decades, Korea suffered under the brutal rule of Japanese imperialists. Now, as a result of World War II, it has been liberated. However, American troops are entrenched in part of Korean territory, and since the arrival of the American troops, a regime of enslavement and brutality has been re-established in South Korea. This is the true face of American imperialists' 'liberation.' In contrast, in the north of the country, since the Soviet army drove out the Japanese oppressors, the Korean people have already begun a new life. In just a few years, North Korea has not only healed the wounds of war but has also inspired the strong creativity of the Korean people.
    The Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Korea and provided various forms of assistance to the country's construction. During this period, the United States was organizing an aggressive war, attempting to put all of Korea at its disposal. However, the Korean people have already recognized the intentions of the new American conquerors, and in the five years since the war, they have been subjected to increasingly tighter shackles of new enslavement. The Korean people will never allow the freedom they have gained to be taken away again. This is the reason for the current imperialist aggression against Korea – the only real reason.
    However, the imperialists have miscalculated. They mistakenly believe that their power is omnipotent over weak nations. Now, the heroic Korean people are victoriously fighting the imperialist aggressors and are gradually driving them out of Korean territory.
    Today, all progressive humanity around the world, all peace advocates, and peace-loving people sympathize with and encourage the heroic struggle of the Korean people. Hundreds of millions of people in various countries are demanding that the imperialist aggressors withdraw their greedy claws from Korea. The Fifth Plenary Session joins its voice with hundreds of millions of people, expressing solidarity with the heroic Korean people who are fighting for freedom. Long live the heroic struggle of the Korean people!"

　　波兰人民支援朝鲜人民斗争
    贝鲁特发表演说斥美国侵略朝鲜
    【新华社讯】波兰通讯社华沙十五日电：波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特，于七月十五日在第五次中央委员会全体会议上发表演说称：“同志们，在第五次中央委员会全体会议展开讨论时，我们首先要讨论和注视一桩举世瞩目的事实——即美帝国主义非法地、横蛮而贪婪地侵略英勇的朝鲜人民。美帝国主义无耻地破坏了一切法律原则，破坏了应适用于一个不曾侵害任何国家的利益的民族之一切国际共存原则，在朝鲜发动了一次嗜杀成性的残暴的侵略战争，并且动员它所控制的全世界资本主义国家来参战。这样一来，在极端不顾任何人道原则的情况下，美帝国主义者领导下的资本主义，便向全世界暴露了它掠夺成性、贪得无厌的嘴脸。美国与那些资本主义国家正在指挥战舰炮轰朝鲜海岸，正在不设防的朝鲜城市上空投掷成千的炸弹，屠杀居民，残酷地纵火摧毁一个与他们毫不相干的国家，但朝鲜人民在这些国家的面前究竟犯了什么罪呢？象其他各族人民一样，他们的罪过仅仅在于争取自由和独立而已。
    数十年来，朝鲜受着日本帝国主义者的残暴统治。现在，由于二次世界大战的结果，它已被解放出来了。但朝鲜的一部分土地上却盘据着美国的军队，而且自美军到达时起，朝鲜南部便再度建立了奴役和残暴的统治。这就是美帝国主义者的“解放”的真面目。而该国北部自苏联军队赶走了日本压迫者以后，朝鲜人民就已经开始新的生活。在短短的几年之内，北朝鲜不仅医治了战争的创伤，而且鼓舞了朝鲜人民强大的创造力。
    苏联从朝鲜撤退了它的军队，并且对该国的建设予以多方面的帮助。而在这一期间，美国却正在组织一个侵略性的战争，企图使整个朝鲜供其驱遣。但是，朝鲜人民已经知道了新的美国征服者的意图，在战后五年间，他们已受到了越来越紧的新奴役的镣铐。朝鲜人民决不让已经得到的自由重被夺去。这就是目前世界帝国主义侵略朝鲜的原因——唯一真实的原因。
    但是，帝国主义估计错了，它们误认自己的力量对弱小民族是万能的。现在英勇的朝鲜人民正在胜利地与帝国主义侵略者进行斗争，而且正在一步一步地将他们赶出朝鲜国境。
    今天，全世界的进步人类，全世界的和平拥护者与爱好和平的人们，都同情并鼓励英勇的朝鲜人民进行斗争。世界各国亿万人民正在要求帝国主义侵略者将他们贪婪的魔掌撤出朝鲜。第五次全体会议和亿万人民同声要求，并表示与正在为自由而斗争的英勇朝鲜人民休戚与共。朝鲜人民的英勇斗争万岁！”
