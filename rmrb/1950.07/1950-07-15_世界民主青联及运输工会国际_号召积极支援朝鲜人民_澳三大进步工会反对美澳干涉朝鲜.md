The World Federation of Democratic Youth declares: "The youth of the world must respond to the military intervention of the US imperialists by actively supporting their Korean youth brothers, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US armed forces from Korea, and proclaiming the right to self-determination of the people. Let the youth of the world express their hatred for the imperialist warmongers by issuing declarations, sending delegations, holding demonstrations and other methods, and announce that they stand with the Korean people in their struggle for their happiness and future, and for the consolidation of peace throughout the world."

Supporting the people of Asia is the glorious duty of transport workers in all countries of the world, especially the glorious duty of workers in the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries. Demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Korea! Demand that the imperialists completely cease interfering in the internal affairs of Korea! Expand the movement to defend peace!"
