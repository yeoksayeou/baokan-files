　　Building an Independent and Autonomous People's New Customs
    National Customs Undertaking Reform Work
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the establishment of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government on October 25, 1949, it has followed the "Decision on Customs Tariff Policy and Customs Work" passed by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on January 27, 1950, and has carried out a series of reform work. These works have enabled China's customs to begin to transform from a state of being controlled by imperialism for a century, lacking independence and autonomy, to an independent and autonomous People's New Customs.

    First, all customs in the country, except for Taiwan, are now under the control of the people. Therefore, in terms of organizational structure, according to the principle stipulated by the Government Administration Council that "the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government must be a unified, centralized, and independent national agency," the General Administration of Customs has successively taken over 26 customs (excluding branch offices) in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Guangzhou, and other places; and has adjusted the organizational structure of each customs, and carried out education for the old customs staff to eliminate the forces and influences of imperialism remaining in the customs. For example, the largest Shanghai Customs in the country, before the adjustment, had 2,329 employees, with internal organization that was layered and complex, and business was mixed and unclear. A document, from bottom to top, and then from top to bottom, had to go through sixteen or seventeen procedures. After the adjustment, the number of personnel was reduced by a quarter (mostly sent to study), while the work efficiency and employee enthusiasm were greatly improved. The General Administration of Customs has also established direct contact with 26 local customs. The responsible personnel of customs across the country are mostly appointed by the General Administration. In this way, the national customs has been initially unified and centralized under the direct leadership of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government.

    The locations of the old customs and the opening of foreign trade ports were based on unequal treaties and the convenience of imperialist economic aggression, rather than on the needs of China's foreign trade. Therefore, the General Administration of Customs has abolished the inland river ports that are not suitable for setting up customs, such as Chongqing, Jinling, and Wuzhou Customs; and has drafted a plan for the principles of setting up customs and the locations for setting up customs throughout the country, which will be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

    In terms of customs powers, in the era when imperialism controlled China's customs, in order to continuously expand its aggression against China's sovereignty, it tried its best to include duties unrelated to customs, and even duties to ensure shipping safety and patrol the national border coasts, within the scope of customs management. According to the decision of the Government Administration Council, the above-mentioned duties should be transferred to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Public Security respectively. In order to properly implement this major reform task, the General Administration of Customs has repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Public Security respectively, and has drafted a handover plan, which can be implemented after being reviewed and approved by the Government Administration Council.

    The task of the new customs is no longer simply collecting taxes as in the past, but to protect the country's production undertakings in accordance with the New Democratic economic policy, especially the foreign trade policy, so that our country will not be subjected to economic aggression by capitalist countries. Due to the fact that the customs in various places have earnestly carried out the supervision and management of import and export trade and cargo transportation in accordance with the policies of the Central People's Government; at the same time, they have flexibly applied the new customs tariff policy, and in the past ten months, they have played an important role in the work of restoring and developing the people's economy of our country. In particular, the anti-smuggling work has made great achievements due to the implementation of the principle of combining punishment and education. For example, in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in April, the phenomenon of smuggling of Western medicine was very rampant. After strict investigation and investigation by Guangzhou Customs, pharmacies in Guangzhou have refused to accept smuggled goods brought by water passengers, and have changed their past mentality of relying on smuggled goods, and have applied to the Foreign Trade Administration for import.

    By the end of June, the national customs revenue, including the Northeast, has reached 50.9% of the 1950 annual customs tariff budget (the revenue of 12 customs has not been included). This is a very difficult thing during the period when China's customs is undergoing a major transformation from being independent and autonomous to being independent and autonomous.

    Under the direct leadership of the General Administration of Customs, another extremely important and arduous task has been completed. That is, the draft of the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China has been drafted. This is a historically significant event. China's customs has been established for nearly a hundred years, and there has never been a basic customs law. Everything is done according to the orders of the agents of imperialism, that is, the Inspector General of Customs. On February 25 this year, according to the decision of the Government Administration Council, the General Administration of Customs established a special committee on customs regulations, which initially drafted the draft customs law in only four months.

    This draft customs law absorbs the experience of the customs in the new and old liberated areas, critically uses the experience of the old customs, and also refers to the successful customs experience and customs law of the socialist Soviet Union. The National Customs Conference, which started on June 19 and ended on July 16, focused on the discussion of the Customs Law. This customs law will be submitted to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation after being supplemented and revised. At the same time, a truly independent and autonomous new customs tariff draft that protects China's national industry and commerce is also being drafted.

    From the above situation, China's customs is currently still in the stage of reform from the old to the new and laying the foundation. Therefore, the general task of the customs in the future is to further promote the above-mentioned work, quickly realize the Central People's Government's policy of unified management and unified leadership, and finally complete the Customs Law and the draft of the new import and export tariff, and prepare for the implementation of the Customs Law and the new tariff. At the same time, it is also necessary to adjust the organizational structure of the national customs, strengthen education in a planned way, train customs personnel, and lay a good foundation for the development of national customs business next year.

### 建设独立自主的人民新海关  全国海关进行改革工作

　　建设独立自主的人民新海关
    全国海关进行改革工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府海关总署自一九四九年十月二十五日成立以来，遵循中央人民政府政务院一九五○年一月二十七日通过的“关于关税政策和海关工作的决定”，已进行了一系列的改革工作。这些工作已使中国的海关，开始从百年来遭受帝国主义控制，不独立、不自主的情况下，转变为独立、自主的人民的新海关。
    首先是，全国海关，除了台湾以外，都已控制在人民的手中。因此，在组织机构上，根据政务院规定的“中央人民政府海关总署，必须是统一集中的和独立自主的国家机关”的原则，海关总署已先后接管了天津、上海、青岛、烟台、广州等地的二十六个海关（分支关所不计在内）；并调整了各海关的组织机构，进行了对旧海关工作人员的教育，以肃清帝国主义残留在海关中的势力和影响。如全国最大的上海海关，未调整前，有职工二千三百二十九人，内部组织叠床架屋，业务混杂不清。一件公文，由下到上，再由上到下，竟要经过十六、七层手续。调整后，人员减缩了四分之一（大部送去学习），而工作效率与职工积极性却大大提高了。海关总署又已与二十六个地方海关取得了直接联系。全国各关负责人员，亦多由总署派定。这样全国海关已经初步统一集中在中央人民政府海关总署的直接领导之下。
    旧海关设置的地点和对外贸易口岸的开放，都是根据不平等条约与帝国主义经济侵略的方便，而不是根据中国对外贸易的需要。因此，海关总署已将不宜设关的内河口岸，如重庆、金陵及梧州三关撤销；并拟出全国设关原则与设关地点的方案，将呈请政务院批准公布。
    在海关职权方面，过去帝国主义控制我国海关的时代，它们为了不断地扩大对我国主权的侵略，便尽量将与海关无关的，甚至为保证航运安全和巡卫国境海岸等职务，也一手包揽在海关管理范围以内。按照政务院的决定，上项职务应分别移交给交通部和公安部。海关总署为了妥善的执行这一重大的改革任务，已多次分别与交通部、公安部会商，并拟定了交接方案，待政务院审核批准后，即可执行。
    新海关的任务，也不是过去那样单纯是收税了，而是要依照新民主主义的经济政策，尤其是对外贸易政策，来保护国家的生产事业，使我国不受资本主义国家的经济侵略。各地海关由于遵照中央人民政府的政策，认真地进行了出进口贸易货运的监管工作；同时灵活运用了新的关税政策，十个月来，在恢复与发展我国人民经济的工作中，已经起了重要的推动作用。特别是缉私工作，由于贯彻了处罚与教育结合的方针，已做出很大的成绩。如港、穗在四月份，西药走私现象甚为猖獗，经广州海关严密缉查，广州各药房对水客所带私货都已拒绝收纳，并改变了过去依靠走私来货的心理，纷向对外贸易管理局申请进口。
    全国关税收入，到六月底止，包括东北在内，已达一九五○年度关税预算的百分之五十·九（还有一二个关的收入没有计算在内）。这在我国海关正从不独立、不自主走向独立、自主的大转变的时期中，是一件很不容易的事情。
    在海关总署直接领导下，还有一件极为重大而艰巨的工作完成了。就是中华人民共和国海关法草案已经拟定。这是一件有历史意义的大事。中国海关设立已经将近一百年，从未有过海关基本法。一切都按照帝国主义的代理人，即海关总税务司的命令办事。今年二月二十五日，海关总署根据政务院的决定，成立了海关法规专门委员会，经过仅四个月时间即初步拟定了海关法草案。
    这个海关法草案里面，吸取了新老解放区海关的经验，并批判地运用了旧海关的经验，同时还参考了社会主义苏联成功的海关经验与苏联海关法。从六月十九日开始，至七月十六日结束的全国关务会议，即以海关法为讨论中心。这个海关法将在补充修正后，提请中央人民政府政务院通过实施。同时，一个真正独立自主，保护我国民族工商业的新的关税税则草案也正在拟定中。
    从上面的情形来看，我国海关目前仍处在由旧到新的改革与打基础的阶段。因此，海关今后的总任务，即在将以上的各项工作更推进一步，迅速实现中央人民政府关于统一管理统一领导的方针，最后完成海关法与进出口新税则草案，并准备海关法与新税则的实施。同时，还须调整全国海关的组织机构，有计划地加强教育，训练海关人员，为明年开展全国海关业务，打下良好的基础。
