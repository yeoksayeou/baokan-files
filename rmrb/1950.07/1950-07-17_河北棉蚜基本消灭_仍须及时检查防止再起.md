　　Hebei Cotton Aphids Basically Eliminated
    Still Need Timely Inspection to Prevent Re-emergence
    [Reported from Baoding by this newspaper] Cotton aphids in cotton fields in Hebei have been basically eliminated. Since early May, cotton aphids successively appeared in cotton fields in various parts of the province, and by early June gradually spread to all counties in the province. The area of cotton fields with aphids accounted for more than 50 percent of the total cotton field area. After vigorous control efforts in various regions, as of June 20th, according to incomplete statistics from 812 villages in 27 counties of five special districts including Shijiazhuang, Handan, Ding County, Hengshui, and Tianjin, more than 542,000 mu of cotton fields were cleared of cotton aphids, halting their development. In particular, several rainfalls have almost completely eliminated the cotton aphids, and the development of cotton seedlings has not been greatly affected.
    All regions attached great importance to the work of controlling aphids from the very beginning. For example, before the occurrence of cotton aphids, the Handan Special District held technical training classes, and counties successively trained more than 1,000 technical personnel. When aphids began to occur, they proactively distributed a large number of sprayers and medicines to various counties without waiting for instructions, greatly encouraging and promoting the work of aphid control. In the Shijiazhuang Special District, all levels of government agencies and schools also transferred 3,153 cadres, teachers, and students to the countryside to help eliminate aphids, universally established aphid control committees, and extensively carried out aphid control work, halting the development of aphids. In the past, the masses had no experience or habit of controlling aphids. Therefore, when mobilizing to eliminate aphids, it was necessary to first carry out key demonstrations in areas with serious cotton aphid infestations, using the actual aphid control results to motivate the masses. For example, in Nan Dougong Village, Fifth District of Cheng'an County, the masses initially lacked confidence in controlling cotton aphids. The cadres first prepared tobacco leaf water to test the control effect. The next day, all the cotton aphids were dead. They organized the masses to visit the site, and as a result, mobilized 146 young and middle-aged people, women, and children from the entire village, and in five days, all the aphids in 1,184 mu of cotton fields were eliminated. As a result, 80 percent of the village cadres and party members in the county learned how to prepare medicine to control cotton aphids, forming a mass movement for aphid control. At present, although aphids in various parts of the province have been basically eliminated, it is still necessary to further control them in order to completely eliminate them, and to conduct timely inspections to prevent their re-emergence.

　　河北棉蚜基本消灭
    仍须及时检查防止再起
    【本报保定讯】河北各地棉田中的蚜虫已经基本上扑灭。该省自五月上旬开始，各地棉田陆续发生蚜虫，到六月上旬渐次蔓延全省各县，有蚜虫的棉田面积约占总棉田面积的百分之五十以上。经过各地大力除治，截至六月二十日为止，据石家庄、邯郸、定县、衡水、天津等五个专区二十七个县、八百一十二个村的不完全统计，共消灭了五十四万二千余亩棉田里的棉蚜，使蚜虫停止了发展。特别是几次下雨，棉蚜几已肃清，棉苗发育未受到大的影响。
    各地对除治蚜虫工作，从最初就很重视，如邯郸专区在发生棉蚜以前，就召开了技术训练班，各县先后训练了一千多名技术人员。蚜虫开始发生时，不待请示，主动将大批喷雾器与药品分发各县，大大的鼓励与推动了治蚜工作。石家庄专区各级机关、学校并抽调了三千一百五十三名干部、教员、学生下乡帮助除蚜，普遍成立了治蚜委员会，广泛地开展了治蚜工作，使蚜虫停止了发展。群众过去对治蚜虫没有经验和习惯，因此，发动除蚜时，必须先在棉蚜严重地区进行重点示范，用实际治蚜效果，带动群众。如成安县五区南豆公村，开始群众对治棉蚜缺乏信心，干部便先配好烟叶水试验除治，次日棉蚜都死了，组织群众实地参观，结果动员起全村青壮年、妇女、儿童一百四十六名，五天功夫就将一千一百八十四亩棉田的蚜虫全部消灭。结果该县百分之八十的村庄干部、党员学会了配药治棉蚜，形成了群众性的治蚜运动。目前该省各地蚜虫虽已基本上被消灭了，但还必须进一步除治，以期彻底消灭，并及时检查，防止再起。
