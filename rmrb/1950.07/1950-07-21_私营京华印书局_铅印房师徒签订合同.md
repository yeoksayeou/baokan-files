　　Private Jinghua Printing House
    Letterpress Room Signs Apprenticeship Contract

    [This Newspaper Reports] The private Jinghua Printing House in the Sixth District of Beijing officially signed apprenticeship contracts on the 13th. According to old customs, there were no masters or apprentices in the printing industry, therefore, it was difficult for apprentices to improve their skills. This time, the signing of the master-apprentice contract in the letterpress room of the bureau is an innovation in the printing industry. A total of fourteen contracts were signed, including fourteen masters and seventeen apprentices (three of which were one master with two apprentices). Before the formal signing of the contract, three master-apprentice discussion meetings were held. During these meetings, it was found that some masters were afraid that their apprentices would not study hard and would not be able to complete the plan; some apprentices were over-ambitious and unwilling to learn about small machines. Based on these situations, the Trade Union Propaganda Department collected methods and lessons learned from signing master-apprentice contracts in various places, published a special issue, and carried out individual mobilization, and some incorrect thoughts and misunderstandings were resolved. Trainees began to find master objects automatically. The first master and apprentice also found a guarantor. Then, the specific tasks of the master, apprentice, and guarantor were studied, and a contract was written. At the contract signing conference, the masters repeatedly guaranteed that they would teach the apprentices well according to the contract and would never be conservative; the apprentices also guaranteed that they would study hard. The conference was filled with an atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving students. (Wu Lian, Kang Qingwu)

　　私营京华印书局
    铅印房师徒签订合同
    【本报讯】京市第六区私营京华印书局于十三日正式签订了师徒合同。按旧规矩，印刷业没有师傅徒弟，因此，徒弟的技术很难提高。这次该局铅印房师徒合同的签订，在印刷业中还是创举。共签订十四份合同，包括十四位师傅、十七名徒弟（有三份是一师二徒的）。合同正式签订之前，召开了三次师徒座谈会。在这些会议中，发现有些师傅怕徒弟不好好学，完不成计划；也有些徒弟好高鹜远，不愿意学小机器等。根据这些情况，工会宣传部收集各地签订师徒合同的办法与经验教训，出了专刊，并进行个别的动员，一些不正确的思想和错误的认识才告解决。学工开始自动找师傅对象。第一对师徒又都找到一位保证人。然后研究了师傅、徒弟保证人的具体任务，写成合同。在签订合同的大会上，师傅再三保证一定按合同教好徒弟，绝不保守；徒弟们也保证一定好好学习。大会充满尊师爱徒气氛。（吴连、康庆武）
