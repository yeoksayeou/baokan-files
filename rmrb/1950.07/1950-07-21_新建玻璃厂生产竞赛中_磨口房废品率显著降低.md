　　Significant Reduction in Defect Rate in Grinding Room

　　[This newspaper reported] Since the third quarter production competition, centered on reducing defects and improving quality, began on July 1st at the Beijing New Glass Factory, there have been many achievements. The original plan for the grinding room's defect rate was no higher than 5%, but it is now only 2.65%; Guo Xiushan's group is even lower at only 0.5%. Li Derui's group in the large workshop has increased its production of batteries from 14 per vat of glass at the beginning to 34. Yang Jingxiu of the graduation group has been very accurate in his water measurement (measuring cups and cylinders used in the reagent room are all marked with graduations, indicating the volume of liquid. When determining the graduations, the volume is first calculated with clean water (such as 1 cc or 5 cc), and then this is used to calculate the position of the graduations on the cup or cylinder one by one) work since the start of the competition, breaking previous records.

　　新建玻璃厂生产竞赛中
    磨口房废品率显著降低
    【本报讯】京市新建玻璃厂以减少废品提高质量为中心的第三季生产竞赛，自七月一日开始以来，已有不少成绩。磨口房原计划废品率最高不超过百分之五，现仅为百分之二点六五；郭秀山小组更仅为百分之零点五。大厂李德瑞小组生产电瓶，已由开始时一缸玻璃出十四个，提高到三十四个。刻度组杨景琇自竞赛以来，量水（药剂室中所用量杯与量筒上均刻有度数，表示容液的体积。在制定刻度时，先以清水算出体积（如一ｃｃ或五ｃｃ），然后以此逐一算出容杯或容筒上刻度的位置）工作都很准确，打破了以往纪录。
