Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th. Remarkable results have been achieved in Jilin Province in planting winter wheat in the severe cold of minus 41 degrees Celsius in northern Manchuria. This is another new achievement in agricultural production in Northeast China after the land reform. The 100,000 mu of winter wheat promoted in the province last autumn is now golden, with heavy ears of wheat, and can be harvested around the 20th of this month. The harvest is expected to be about 80%. Before the land reform, although some farmers in the province brought winter wheat seeds from inside the customs to try planting, due to the constraints of the feudal system and the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets, farmers gained little from their hard work and their enthusiasm for production was low, so winter wheat was never promoted. After the land reform was implemented successively in the new and old areas of the province in 1947 and 1948, winter wheat began to be promoted from the mountains to the plains. The planting area was 20,000 mu in 1948 and reached 100,000 mu last year, and will be expanded to 1 million mu this year. Farmers who planted winter wheat in the province the year before last have generally benefited last year. On average, each mu of winter wheat can produce more than 30 jin more than spring wheat, and the income is about three times more than other coarse grains. Winter wheat matures earlier, which can not only avoid the jaundice disease that is prone to occur in spring wheat, but also solve the problem of farmers' food shortages during the summer famine. The planting, weeding, and harvesting of winter wheat can be coordinated with other crops, thus overcoming the phenomenon of uneven labor among farmers, and it is possible to achieve two harvests on one piece of land in one year.

　　东北土改后的又一新成就
    吉林种植冬麦成绩良好
    种植面积逐步推广麦穗盈实可望丰收
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】在北满零下四十一度的严寒中种植冬麦的工作已在吉林省获卓著成绩，这是东北农业生产在土地改革后又一新的成就。去年秋天在该省推广的十万亩冬麦，现已一片金黄，麦穗沉垂，本月二十日前后即可收割，年景可望达八成左右。该省在土地改革前，虽有个别农民把关内的冬麦种籽带来试种，但由于封建制度的束缚与敌伪长期的统治，农民辛苦耕作所得无几，生产情绪低落，冬麦始终未能推广。一九四七和一九四八两年该省新、老区相继实行土地改革后，冬麦就开始由山沟推广到平原地带。一九四八年播种面积为两万亩，去年已达到十万亩，今年将扩大到一百万亩。该省前年种植冬麦的农民去年已普遍获得好处，平均每亩冬麦较春麦可多产三十余斤，较其他粗粮每亩收入约多三倍。冬麦成熟期较早，既能避免春麦易生的疸病，又可解决农民夏荒期间吃粮困难。冬麦的播种、锄草至收割期间和其他作物能调配开，因此也就克服了农民忙闲不均的现象，并可做到在一块土地上一年得到两次收成。
