Aggressors Will Eat Their Own Bitter Fruit
    Mao Dun
    The American imperialists' pig snout has been painfully hit in Korea! Within twenty days, on the Korean Peninsula, this greedy, aggressive pig has already been bloodied. The formidable air fortresses and jet planes, touted like myths for five or six years, are now being beaten in the skies over Korea until they howl and shamelessly excuse themselves: the weather isn't helping, and the newest planes aren't suitable for supporting ground troops. In twenty days, the commander has been changed three times. Following the navy and air force, the army has also arrived, and all American equipment and the latest weapons have been used, but what is the result? Defeat after defeat, several thousand have been annihilated, and nearly a thousand have been captured. The pig snout is bloodied, but this greedy and stupid aggressive pig has not accepted the bloody lesson. It is "unwilling to give up until reaching the Yellow River"!
    American imperialism has been supporting the puppet Syngman Rhee regime for more than just a day or two, and its deliberate attempt to invade North Korea has long been an open secret. When Truman issued a statement on June 27th, openly declaring its intention of armed aggression, it was arrogant and invincible. American imperialism knows how to calculate. But now, its wishful thinking has failed. Because it only calculates the quantity of airplanes, warships, and cannons, it can never and will never calculate that the power of the people demanding liberation is infinite. It can never and will never calculate that the power of peace-loving people all over the world is infinite. Look at the angry tide of protests against American imperialist aggression in Korea from people all over the world (including the American people), which is the preliminary manifestation of the power of people all over the world.
    In Truman's statement on June 27th, he also arrogantly and openly declared that he would use force to protect the last nest of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—Taiwan. This is an act of armed aggression by American imperialism against Chinese territory. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, has already issued a solemn statement, refuting it severely. The Chinese people not only unanimously support Minister Zhou's statement, but also have the confidence that the arrogant attempt of American imperialism will definitely be shattered by the power of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have long experienced the airplanes, cannons, and tanks of American imperialism, and the paper tiger has long been exposed. American imperialism and its accomplices were shocked by the disastrous defeat of the American army in Korea, but we Chinese people have always been deeply convinced that the heroic Korean people will surely inflict a heavy blow on the aggressors. This conclusion is drawn by the Chinese people from their own glorious combat experience. We are also equally convinced that the Vietnamese people, the Filipino people, and all Asian people under the target of American imperialist aggression will surely completely smash the arrogant aggression of American imperialism, and the final victory belongs to the Asian people!
    Now American imperialism is hastily sending more army, navy, and air force to Korea, and some war mongers are clamoring to use atomic bombs. The American imperialist air force's slaughterous bombing of peaceful cities and people in Korea will become more frequent day by day. However, we all clearly know that these atrocities by American imperialism will not have any result except to incur more blood debts. If there is any result, it will be more heroic fighting by the Korean people and greater anger from the people of the world. Even within the United States, millions of American people have risen up to oppose this criminal act by their country's reactionary ruling class that violates the will and interests of the American people. Hundreds of millions of people around the world unanimously support the heroic fighting Korean people. Hitler's fate awaits the American war mongers. If there really is a day when an atomic bomb explodes over the Korean Peninsula, then the death knell of American imperialism will sound! Facts will prove that there can only be such an ending. The Chinese people and the people of the world have clearly stated: world peace cannot be undermined. We have the determination to defend peace and also have the preparation to punish those who undermine peace. If the war mongers regard the people as deceivable and act perversely, refusing to wake up until their death, then they will eat their own bitter fruit!

　　侵略者将自食其果
    茅盾
    美帝的猪鼻子在朝鲜碰痛了！二十天之内，在朝鲜半岛，这只贪婪的侵略的猪已经碰得血淋淋了。像神话似的吹捧了五六年的唬吓人的什么空中堡垒、喷气式飞机，现在在朝鲜上空被打得抱头大叫，只好厚颜自解嘲道：天气不帮忙，而且最新式的飞机不宜于支援地面作战部队。二十天内，三易统帅，海空军外，紧跟着，陆军也来了，一切的美式装备，最新武器，都使用上了，然而结果呢，一败再败，被歼数千，被俘亦近千。猪鼻子碰得血淋淋了，然而这只贪婪而又蠢笨的侵略的猪还没有接受血淋淋的教训，它是“不到黄河心不死”的！
    美帝扶植傀儡李承晚，已非一朝一夕，处心积虑侵略北朝鲜，久已成为公开的秘密；六月二十七日杜鲁门发表声明公然宣布它的武装侵略的意图的时候，骄横之气，不可一世。美帝是会打算盘的。但是现在，它的如意算盘落空了。因为它只会计算飞机、军舰、大炮的数量，它永远不能也不会计算要求解放的人民的力量是无穷无尽的。它永远不能也不会计算全世界爱好和平的人民的力量是无穷无尽的。请看全世界人民（包括美国人民）对于美帝侵略朝鲜的抗议的怒潮，这就是全世界人民力量的初步表现。
    六月二十七日杜鲁门的声明中，还狂妄的公然宣称将以武力保护蒋匪帮的最后巢穴——台湾。这是美帝对于中国领土的武力侵略的行为，我中央人民政府周兼外长业已发表严正的声明，痛加驳斥。中国人民不但一致拥护周外长的声明，而且具有信心，美帝的狂妄企图一定要被中国人民的力量所粉碎。美帝的飞机大炮和坦克，中国人民早已领教过了，纸老虎早已戳穿。美帝及其帮凶们看到美军在朝鲜的惨败而大吃一惊，我们中国人民却自始就深信英勇的朝鲜人民必能予侵略者以惨重的打击。这一个结论是中国人民从自己的光荣战斗经验中得出来的。我们又同样地深信越南人民、菲律宾人民，以及美帝侵略目标下的一切亚洲人民，也必能彻底粉碎美帝的狂妄的侵略行为，最后胜利是属于亚洲人民的！
    现在美帝正在急急忙忙派遣更多的陆海空军到朝鲜去，一些战争贩子们已在叫嚣着使用原子弹。美帝空军对于朝鲜的和平城市与人民的屠杀性的轰炸，将会一天比一天更多起来。然而我们都明白知道，美帝这些暴行除了欠下更多的血债，是不能有什么结果的。如果有什么结果，那就是朝鲜人民更英勇的战斗，全世界人民更大的愤怒；即在美国内部，现在已有几百万美国人民奋起反对他们本国的反动统治阶级的此种违反美国人民的意志和利益的罪恶行为。全世界亿万人民一致为英勇战斗中的朝鲜人民作后援。希特勒的命运等待着美国的战争贩子们。如果真有一天，原子弹在朝鲜半岛上空爆响了，那也就是美帝的丧钟响了！事实将证明，只能有这样的结局。中国人民和全世界人民已经明白表示：世界和平不容破坏，我们具有保卫和平的决心，也具有惩罚那些破坏和平者的准备。如果战争贩子们以人民为可欺而倒行逆施，至死不悟，那他们将自食其果！（转载《文艺报》第二十一期）
