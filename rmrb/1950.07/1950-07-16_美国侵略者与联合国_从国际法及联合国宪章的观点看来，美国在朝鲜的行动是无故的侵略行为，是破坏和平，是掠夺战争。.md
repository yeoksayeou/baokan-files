　　American Aggressors and the United Nations
    From the Perspective of International Law and the UN Charter, America's Actions in Korea are Unprovoked Acts of Aggression, Destruction of Peace, and Wars of Plunder.
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Moscow, July 13th] TASS Moscow, July 13th: The latest issue of "New Times" published an editorial titled "American Aggressors and the United Nations," pointing out: American imperialists, in their efforts to disguise their piratical adventure in Korea with the banner of the United Nations, have become recklessly unscrupulous. It is difficult to imagine a more brutal insult to the flag, charter, spirit, and principles of the United Nations than this. From the perspective of international law and the UN Charter, America's actions in Korea are unprovoked acts of aggression, destruction of peace, and wars of plunder, the purpose of this war is to deprive Korea of its national independence and establish an anti-people regime in Korea, which will allow the United States to turn Korea into its colony and its strategic stronghold in the Far East.
    The predatory nature of the American adventure is so obvious that even the completely mendacious American newspapers are at a loss, self-contradictory, and displaying obvious confusion and embarrassment when commenting on Gromyko's statement.
    Since the U.S. government has used its land, sea, and air forces to carry out military intervention in Korea, it has already committed an act hostile to peace. In order to fabricate a pretext for this intervention, the U.S. government has unscrupulously and shamefully violated the UN Charter. The Security Council's decisions to support military intervention in Korea's internal affairs are illegal because they were passed in the absence of two of the five permanent members of the Council - the Soviet Union and China. This illegal attempt to lend the UN flag to the US to cover up its aggression against Korea powerfully confirms the subversive activities of the US ruling clique within the United Nations and demonstrates their efforts to turn this organization into a branch of the State Department.
    As shown by the comments on Gromyko's statement from all sides, progressive people in all countries believe that the Soviet policy exposes the truth of the actions of the American rulers and thus makes a great contribution to the cause of peace. It is intriguing that the opinions of bourgeois newspapers in various countries on the American aggression against Korea are by no means uniform. We can find very dissatisfied and sober comments among them regarding this event and the illegal decisions of the Security Council. Even many bourgeois figures in the United States itself have serious doubts about the consequences of this reckless adventure.
    The American demand to treat the heinous attack on Korea as a "common cause," and the reaction of public opinion and even the governments of the Marshallized countries to this demand, show that the American hope of turning the United Nations into a broad military alliance against the Soviet Union, against the people's democracies, and against the entire democratic camp, is based on very fragile foundations. The Korean question, like a powerful searchlight, clearly illuminates the contradictions within the imperialist camp. India and Egypt's refusal to support the July 7th resolution authorizing MacArthur's headquarters to fly the UN flag; the great pressure the United States had to exert in order for many countries to sponsor its aggression against Korea; - all these show how unstable the position of American imperialism is. The more obvious the aggressiveness and predatory nature of Washington's policies become, the more isolated the war-mongering group becomes in the world. The American aggression against Korea has been severely condemned and denounced by the people of all countries. The Soviet government's view that interference in Korean internal affairs is impermissible has been supported by the vast majority of the public around the world. The sympathy of millions of working people in all countries is entirely on the side of Korea, which has become a battlefield. The signature campaign still underway in most countries is now combined with a broad movement to support the Korean people who are engaged in a war against foreign intervention. In many countries, workers' delegations surrounded the American embassy, demanding that American troops withdraw from Korea. Committees to support the Korean people are being formed.
    The attempt to use the UN flag to cover up a robber war cannot save the face of the American government. MacArthur and Bradley, who are sending Flying Fortresses to bomb Korean cities, will forever be murderers and war criminals. An olive branch cannot disguise the fact that the United States is engaged in armed intervention and that the United States has broken the peace. The United States must bear all the consequences of this heinous crime.

　　美国侵略者与联合国
    从国际法及联合国宪章的观点看来，美国在朝鲜的行动是无故的侵略行为，是破坏和平，是掠夺战争。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：最近一期《新时代》发表题为《美国侵略者与联合国》的社论，指出：美国帝国主义者在他们努力以联合国的招牌掩饰其在朝鲜的海盗般的冒险中，已放肆到了毫无顾忌的程度。很难想像对联合国的旗帜、宪章、精神及其原则还有比这更凶暴的侮辱了。从国际法及联合国宪章的观点看来，美国在朝鲜的行动是无故的侵略行为，是破坏和平，是掠夺战争，这个战争的目的是要剥夺朝鲜的民族独立，并在朝鲜建立反人民的政权，这个政权将允许美国把朝鲜变为它的殖民地，及其在远东的战略据点。
    美国冒险的掠夺性质是这样明显，甚至完全说谎的美国报纸在它们评述葛罗米柯的声明时也是手足无措及自相矛盾，并表现了明显的混乱及狼狈。
    美国政府既然在朝鲜使用它的陆海空军进行军事干涉，它就是已经作了敌对和平的行动。为了要替这个干涉制造口实，美国政府不惜全然与可耻地破坏联合国宪章。安理会支持军事干涉朝鲜内政的决定是非法的，因为它们是在理事会五个常任理事国中两个常任理事国——苏联与中国——缺席的时候通过的。这个把联合国旗帜借给美国掩护侵略朝鲜的非法企图，非常有力地证实了美国统治集团在联合国内的破坏活动，证明了他们力图把这个组织变为国务院的分支。
    正如各方对葛罗米柯声明的评论中所显示的，所有国家的进步人士都认为，苏联的政策暴露了美国统治者的行动的真相，因而对和平事业有巨大的贡献。令人寻味的是，各国资产阶级报纸对于美国侵略朝鲜的意见绝不是一致的，我们可以在它们中间找到对于这个事件和对于安理会非法决定的非常不满与清醒的评论。甚至美国本国的许多资产阶级人士对于这个鲁莽冒险的后果如何也抱有严重的怀疑。
    美国要求把对朝鲜的万恶进攻作为“共同的事业”，公众舆论和甚至马歇尔化国家政府对这要求的反应显示出：美国要把联合国变成反对苏联、反对人民民主国家、和反对整个民主阵营的广泛军事联合的希望，是寄托在非常脆弱的基础上的。朝鲜问题像一个强力的探照灯，极其清晰地照出了帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾。印度和埃及拒绝支持七月七日授权麦克阿瑟总部悬挂联合国旗帜的决议；美国为了要许多国家赞助它对朝鲜的侵略，必须施用很大的压力；——这些都显示美帝国主义的地位是如何的不稳固。华盛顿的政策之侵略性和掠夺性变得愈是明显，贩卖战争的集团在全世界就愈孤立。美国的侵略朝鲜已受到所有国家人民的严厉责备与声斥。苏联政府认为干涉朝鲜国内事务是不许可的，这种坚定的政策受到全世界极广大公众的拥护。所有国家千百万劳动人民的同情完全在沦为战场的朝鲜这一方面。仍在大多数国家进行的签名运动现在已与声援正在从事反对外国干涉战争的朝鲜人民的广大运动结合在一起。在许多国家中，工人代表团包围美国大使馆，要求美国军队退出朝鲜。声援朝鲜人民的委员会正在组成。
    想用联合国旗帜来掩护强盗战争的企图并不能挽救美国政府的面子。正在派遣飞行堡垒轰炸朝鲜城市的麦克阿瑟和布莱德雷永远是杀人犯和战犯。橄榄花园掩饰不了美国是在从事武装干涉和美国已经破坏了和平这一事实，这个万恶罪行的一切后果应由美国负责。
