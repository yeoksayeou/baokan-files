Several Problems in Current Salt Production
    By Our Correspondent, Jian Qing

    Salt is a great resource in our country. In its peak period, the annual output reached over 100 million dan. According to statistics from six major salt-producing areas, including Northeast China, Changlu, Yuncheng, Shandong, Huaibei, and Zigong, the annual output is 6.8 million dan, with 76,822 salt workers. Some state-owned salt fields are equipped with electric motors, while others use horsepower machines, steam engines, windmills, waterwheels, and other means for production. The salt produced is not only supplied to the local area and nearby provinces but also exported to foreign countries. In addition to the six salt-producing areas mentioned above, there are also several other salt-producing areas, including Guangdong and Guangxi, Huainan, Zhejiang, northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, Yunnan, and the Northwest.

    Due to the devastation and plunder by the Kuomintang reactionaries, production in various salt-producing areas has been greatly reduced, and some have even been shut down. Since liberation, under the direct management and support of the People's Government, major salt fields have been serving the country by supplying military and civilian needs, solving the problem of industrial raw materials, and striving for foreign markets. However, there are still some problems in production that need to be solved.

    The first is the problem of overproduction of salt. Salt has three uses: first, military and civilian consumption. Excluding salt workers and people in salt-producing areas who do not buy salt, with a population of 400 million, the annual salt consumption is 8 jin per person, requiring only 32 million dan of salt. Second, chemical and fishery use. China's chemical industry is not developed, so the current industrial salt consumption is very small. The Yongli Company in North China uses 2.5 million dan of salt annually, plus the national fishery salt consumption, totaling 6.5 million dan. Third, export. However, there are still many difficulties at present, which need to be worked hard to solve. Therefore, last year, only 48 million dan of salt were sold nationwide, with an annual salt surplus of 25.2 million dan.

    In the case of overproduction, the policy adopted by the government has to be: maintaining major salt-producing areas and reducing other salt-producing areas; developing those salt-producing areas with advanced production methods, low costs, good quality, and convenient transportation, and eliminating those backward native salt and scattered coastal stove salt. However, in the process of implementation, some cadres cannot understand the idea, thinking that native salt still needs to be developed. Obviously, this is the result of not looking at the problem from an overall perspective. It should be recognized that the support for sea salt is not only for the development of advanced production but also for the necessary tax revenue for the country. Now that the state has reduced salt taxes, the sales of sea salt have been more prosperous than before, and native salt will naturally be eliminated.

    Accompanying the salt sales problem is the transportation problem. Many places cannot buy salt due to inconvenient transportation. For example, in Guizhou, 50 jin of rice are needed to exchange for 1 jin of salt. This abnormal phenomenon will be solved by vigorously organizing transportation and sales and developing transportation.

    Secondly, salt production is seasonal, and all work must be carried out with this characteristic in mind. February to June is the peak season for salt production. In seasonal production, special emphasis should be placed on the unity of long-term workers and seasonal workers. Originally, there was a big difference between the wages and treatment of seasonal workers and long-term workers. Long-term workers in private factories have fixed wages and high treatment; seasonal workers have the largest number and the work is necessary, but their wages are low. Therefore, in addition to taking care of them in life, it is best to strive to implement hourly wages, sign contracts, establish a responsibility system, and reward model groups and individuals to encourage their production enthusiasm. In the off-season, the employment problem of seasonal workers also needs to be paid attention to and resolved. The education of salt workers must also be adapted to seasonality. For example, the Northeast uses the production gap to open short-term training classes. After workers are educated, they play a great role in production the following year. In terms of welfare, the Northeast stipulates that seasonal workers who have worked continuously for three years can enjoy labor insurance and welfare benefits, and those who interrupt for one year are recalculated. During the busiest production period, the Northeast organized doctors to go to the beaches to carry out medical work and inspect the sanitary equipment of the workshops to prevent diseases. When production is reduced, relief and proper resettlement must be provided for unemployed workers.

    Finally, salt production must adopt a method of decentralized operation and centralized management. Due to the large salt area, small production units, backward manual technology, simple production tools, and few workers, it is difficult to establish a regular inspection system and assessment system. Therefore, we must rely on the unity of team leaders, long-term workers, and seasonal workers to do a good job in production, separately stipulate production tasks, and decentralize operations. However, in terms of production, sales, and taxation, we must take overall consideration. National salt production must be centrally led by the government, and sales and taxation must also be unified nationwide. In public-private joint ventures of salt fields, in order to implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, we also need to concentrate leadership on the basis of democratic management. To achieve the goal of centralized management, it is necessary to conduct criticism and self-criticism to further strengthen the relationship between the administration and the trade union; to establish in cadres the idea of relying on the working class to restore and develop production; to oppose those who only care about the welfare of workers and not production, or only care about production and not the lives of workers; and to only pay attention to long-term workers and not seasonal and short-term workers. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses of workers to abolish the feudal old systems existing in salt beaches and salt wells and implement a new system of democratic management in salt production.

　　目前盐业生产中的几个问题
    本报记者  剑清
    盐业是我国一大富源，最盛时代每年产量达一亿担以上，根据东北、长芦、运城、山东、淮北、自贡市六个较集中的主要产盐区统计，每年产盐六、八○○万担，有盐工七六、八二二人。国营盐场一部分装有电动机，其余则用马力机、蒸汽机、风车、水车等进行生产。产盐除供应本区及附近诸省外，余盐还运销国外。此外除了上述六个产盐区，尚有两广、淮南、浙江、川北、川东、云南、西北等几个产盐区。
    各产盐区由于国民党反动派的摧残和掠夺，生产已大大减少，有的甚至已经停顿。解放以后，各大盐田已在人民政府的直接经营和扶植下，为全国供应军需民食及解决工业原料，争取国外市场而服务。但在生产中尚存在着若干问题需要解决。
    首先是盐业生产的过剩问题。盐的用途有三：第一是军需民食。全国人口中除去盐工及产盐区群众不买盐外，以四亿人口计算，每人每年吃盐八斤，仅需盐三、二○○万担。第二是化工渔业用盐。中国化学工业不发达，故目前工业用盐为数极小。华北永利公司每年用盐二五○万担，加上全国渔业用盐共计六五○万担。第三是出口。但目前困难仍多，尚待努力解决。因此去年全国仅销出盐四、八○○万担，年存盐二、五二○万担。
    在生产过剩的情况下，政府采取的方针，不得不是：维持主要盐区，缩小其他盐区；发展那些生产方法进步、成本低、质量好、交通方便的盐区，淘汰那些落后的土盐及沿海分散的灶盐。但在执行过程中，有些干部思想打不通，以为土盐还须发展。显然，这是没有从全面观点来看问题的结果。应该认识，对海盐的扶植，不仅是为了发展进步的生产，同时也是为了国家必要的税收。现在，国家减轻盐税之后，海盐销路已较前畅旺，土盐亦将自然淘汰。
    伴随着盐的销路问题而来的是运输问题，有许多地方因交通不便买不到盐，如贵州一带需要五十斤大米换一斤盐。这种不正常的现象，将以努力组织运销和发展交通事业求得解决。
    其次，盐的生产是有季节性的，一切工作都要抓住这个特点来进行。二月至六月为盐业生产的旺季，在季节生产中要特别强调长工和季工的团结。原来季工的工资和待遇与长工有很大差别，私营厂长工工资固定，待遇高；季工数量最多，工作又必需，但他们的工资低，因此除从生活上加以照顾外，最好争取实行计时工资，订立合同，建立负责制，对模范小组及个人应加以奖励，鼓舞其生产情绪。在不生产的季节，季工的职业问题亦需注意解决。对盐工的教育也必需适应季节性，如东北利用生产空隙开短训班，工人经过教育后，第二年在生产上起了很大作用。在福利事业方面，东北规定季工连续工作三年者，可享受劳保福利待遇，中断一年者重计。在生产最忙时，东北组织了医生下滩地进行医疗工作，并检查工房卫生设备，预防发生疾病。在缩小生产时，对失业工人则需进行救济与妥善安置。
    最后，盐业生产必须采取分散经营和集中管理的方法。由于盐区大，生产单位小，手工技术落后，生产工具简陋，工人少，经常的检查制度与考核制度很难建立，因而必须依靠组长、长工与季工的团结来搞好生产，分别规定生产任务，分散经营。但在产、销、税三方面则必须统筹。全国盐业生产须由政府集中领导，销售和税收亦必须全国统一。在公、私、合营的盐场中，为了贯彻公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策，亦需在民主管理的基础上集中领导。要达到集中管理的目的，需要经过批评与自我批评，进一步密切行政与工会的关系；在干部中树立依靠工人阶级恢复与发展生产的思想；反对那些只管工人福利不管生产，或只管生产不管工人生活；只重视长工不重视季工与短工等偏向。同时要发动工人群众废除存在盐滩、盐井中的封建性的旧制度，实行盐业生产上的民主管理的新制度。
