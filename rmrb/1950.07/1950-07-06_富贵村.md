　　Prosperous Village
    Liu Jiansheng, Ren Zhiqiao
    Prosperous Village was originally Wanghai Suijia Village in Wendeng County, Shandong Province. Since the implementation of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and land reform, the farmers have broken the shackles of feudal landlord exploitation, people have gotten rid of the life of hunger and cold, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have organized themselves to produce and prosper. After several years of the Great Production Movement, the village's agricultural production by the end of last year had greatly exceeded the pre-war production level. This is the origin of this village's renaming to Prosperous Village in 1947.
    The Communist Party Led the Emancipation
    Before emancipation, Prosperous Village originally had only sixty households and 640 mu of land, more than half of which was occupied by seven landlord-rich peasant households. The forty-two hired and poor peasant households only owned a meager 72 mu of land, averaging only 3.5 fen per person. They could not make a living and had to herd cattle, carry heavy loads, rent land, or beg for food. At that time, there were 36 begging sticks and 47 load carriers in the whole village; many people could not find wives, so there was a saying in Wanghai Suijia Village: "Many beggars, many load carriers, many bachelors." These three sentences depicted the farmers' difficult lives in this village.
    Since the establishment of the anti-Japanese democratic government in 1940, after rent reduction and interest reduction, capital increase, and the implementation of land reform in 1946, more than 700 mu of land in the village returned to the farmers from the hands of the landlords. Now, the village has 81 households and a total of 1,003 mu of land, and the farmers are happily working on their own land. Labor hero Zhang Fugui's family of six has developed from a hired peasant without even one mu of land to a middle peasant with 24.7 mu of land, with a head of livestock and a small cart, reaching a good life of abundance. Wang Chengtian, who had been carrying heavy loads for many years, was still a bachelor at the age of 49. After the land reform, he married and had children. He happily told everyone: "Chairman Mao gave us working people great happiness, one after another, that will never end."
    Organize and Work Hard for Production
    Under the leadership of the CCP village branch and labor hero Zhang Fugui, the emancipated farmers of Prosperous Village actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "organize" and carried out the Great Production Movement with unparalleled enthusiasm. After the wheat harvest in 1943, Zhang Fugui was the first to organize a mutual aid group including 15 households. With mutual aid and mobilizing women to participate in labor, not only was the planting timely and the work careful, but also five laborers were saved to develop sideline production. In that year, the whole group harvested nearly 5,000 catties more grain. The villagers saw with their own eyes that organized work produced more grain than individual work; the following year, ten mutual aid groups were organized, carrying out production with annual plans and household calculations. As the farmers' awareness and production enthusiasm increased, farming methods were also improving. Labor hero Zhang Fugui first took out eight fen of land and, under the guidance of the county farm, specialized in variety, fertilization, and farming method experiments, which the farmers passed on as "Zhang Fugui's small farm." The village's deep plowing has increased from 5% to more than 90%; in the past there was no winter plowing habit, now winter plowing accounts for 27%, in the past wheat was hoed once, corn was hoed five times, now wheat is hoed two or three times, corn is hoed eight or nine times. Industrial raw material production - peanuts - has increased from 5% to 20%. Regarding seed selection and seed soaking, which were not customary in the past, it has now reached 40%. The exchange of improved varieties is even more common, such as the promotion of flat-eared wheat and "Qida 195" wheat varieties, which this year has reached 62% of all wheat fields. In order to increase production, they paid special attention to fertilizing the land, actively increasing fertilizer from all aspects, making "artificial urine," "沤 green manure," and "积 dry ash," which have been promoted throughout the village, so the amount of fertilizer applied has greatly increased. According to last year's statistics: the village's 1,003 mu of land applied more than 15,000 cartloads of manure throughout the year, an average of 15 carts per mu, twice as much as before emancipation, in addition to applying more than 8,000 catties of soybean cake and other topdressing fertilizers. Old farmer Ni Peisong happily said: "We couldn't even afford soybean cake before, if it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership to turn us over, produce and prosper, how could we use soybean cake as fertilizer." The farmers also began to break the idea of relying on the heavens for food, digging wells for irrigation, and now the village has dug 35 wells. Because the land was returned to the farmers, even the hilly thin land was turned into fertile land. By the end of last year, the average yield of this village had more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. For example, before the war, corn averaged 80 to 90 catties per mu, now it produces 180 to 190 catties per mu. Agricultural production achievements increased year by year: in 1944, the village achieved plowing five and surplus one, in 1945 plowing three and surplus one, and in 1946 it increased to plowing two and surplus one. Labor hero Zhang Fugui won two plowing one and surplus two in 1948 and 1949, creating an unprecedented new record on the farmers' production front.
    A New Atmosphere
    The current Prosperous Village has changed in many ways.
    When you enter the village, you will feel that everywhere presents a new atmosphere after the emancipation of the farmers. First, the "Guandi Temple" at the east end of the village was transformed into four brand-new classrooms and a primary school was established. The whole village also set up a cooperative. The front and back village streets were all newly paved with stones. Mentioning these two streets, the farmers in the village happily said that they were major constructions after the emancipation. Many farmers are also planning to rebuild houses and enclose walls after the autumn harvest. Before emancipation, the village only raised 30 pigs, now it has added up to 33 pigs, a new-style waterwheel and 44 small carts. The farmers in this village have also improved culturally. In the past, there was no primary school in the village, and only eight children of landlords and rich peasants were literate. After emancipation, the village school has been running continuously, and no school-age children, male or female, are not in school. Women's literacy classes and youth study rooms are all active. Mutual aid groups take newspapers with them to work on the mountains, and village cadres take literacy cards with them to the mountains, working and learning characters at the same time. Those who know more than 1,000 characters have reached 37, and out of 84 young and middle-aged women in the village, only 11 are illiterate. Young women can almost all write letters, can read popular newspapers, and have organized two newspaper correspondent groups, regularly writing articles for newspapers. As a result of cultural improvement, the farmers in this village no longer seek gods and worship Buddha, burn incense and burn paper. The marriages of young people are all their own decisions. According to the statistics of the last four years, 49 couples in the village have married freely, and 27 bachelors have married wives. Now this village is full of harmony, love, and mutual aid, and everyone is happily working for a better life.

　　富贵村
    刘健生·任志樵
    富贵村原是山东文登县的望海隋家村，自从实行了减租减息土地改革之后，农民打掉了封建地主的压榨、剥削的枷锁，人们摆脱了饥寒交迫的生活，在共产党的领导下，组织起来生产发家，经过几年的大生产运动，该村农业生产至去年年底，已大大超过战前生产水平。这就是这个村从一九四七年更名为富贵村的本源。
    共产党领导翻了身
    富贵村在翻身前，原来只有六十户人家，六百四十亩地，半数以上被七户地主富农占去，四十二户雇贫农，仅占有薄田七十二亩，每人平均三分半。他们无法生活，只好给人看牛扛活、租种和讨饭吃。那时全村共有三十六条讨饭的棍子，和四十七个扛活的；很多人讨不到老婆，所以流传着望海隋家有三多：“讨饭的多；扛活的多；单身汉多。”这三句话，刻划了这个村子的农民的困苦生活。
    自一九四○年抗日民主政权建立后，经过减租减息、增资及一九四六年实行土地改革，全村有七百多亩地从地主手里回到农民手中，现在全村八十一户人家，共有土地一千零三亩，农民们在自己的土地上愉快的劳动着。劳动英雄张福贵六口人，已由一亩地也没有的雇农，发展到二十四亩七分地的中农，并有一头牲口，一辆小车子，达到了丰衣足食的好光景。长年抗活的王成田四十九岁还是光身汉，土改后已娶妻生子，他高兴的到处对人说：“毛主席给咱劳动人的大喜事，一个跟一个，永远也不能完。”
    组织起来，努力生产
    在中共村支部及劳动英雄张福贵领导下，富贵村的翻身农民积极响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，都以无比的热情开展大生产运动。四三年麦收后，张福贵第一个组织了一个包括十五户的互助组。在互助及发动妇女参加劳动下，不但种地及时，干活仔细，并省出五个劳力开展副业生产。当年全组就多收粮食近五千斤。村里农民都亲眼看到组织起来比单人干活多打粮；第二年就有十个互助组组织起来，做到年年订计划，家家作打算的进行生产。随着农民的觉悟和生产情绪的提高，耕作方法也在改进着，劳动英雄张福贵首先拿出八分地，在县农场指导下，专作品种、施肥、种作法的试验，农民们都传为“张福贵式的小农场”。全村深刨地已由百分之五增加到百分之九十以上；过去无冬耕习惯，现在冬耕地占百分之二十七，过去小麦锄一遍，苞米锄五遍，现在小麦锄两、三遍，苞米锄八、九遍。工业原料生产——花生已由百分之五增种到百分之二十。关于选种、浸种，过去没习惯，现已达到百分之四十。调换优良品种更为普遍，如推广扁穗小麦及“齐大一九五”小麦种，今年已达到全部麦田的百分之六十二。他们为了增产，特别注意对土地的施肥，积极从各方面增加肥料，制“人造尿”、“沤绿肥”、“积干灰”，已在全村推广起来，因此施肥量大增。据去年统计：全村一千零三亩地，全年共上粪一万五千余车，平均每亩十五车，比翻身前增加两倍，此外并施豆饼等追肥八千余斤。老农倪培松高兴的说：“早先连豆饼都吃不上，要不是毛主席的领导翻身，生产发家，那能把豆饼当粪用。”农民们并开始打破靠天吃饭的思想，打井浇地，现全村已打井三十五眼。由于土地归还了农民，丘岭薄地也都把它变成良田，至去年年底，这村产量平均即已超过战前一倍以上。如战前苞米平均每亩产八、九十斤，现在每亩产一百八、九十斤。农业生产成绩与年俱增：一九四四年全村作到耕五余一，一九四五年耕三余一，一九四六年提高到耕二余一。劳动英雄张福贵则于一九四八、一九四九年连获两个耕一余二，在农民生产战线上创造空前的新纪录。
    一片新气象
    现在的富贵村，很多地方都变样了。
    当你一走进村子，便会觉得到处都呈现着农民翻身后的新气象，首先把村东头的“关帝庙”改建成四间崭新的教室，设立了一处小学。全村还设了一处合作社。前后两条村街，全部用石子新铺过。提到这两条街，村里的农民都高兴的说是翻身后的大建设。不少农民又打谱在秋后重新盖房子、套墙垣。翻身前全村只养三十只猪，现在又添上养到三十三只猪，一架新式水车和四十四辆小车子。这村的农民在文化上也提高了，过去村里没有小学，全村只有八个地主富农子弟识字，翻身后，全村的学校一直就开办着，男女学龄儿童没有一个不上学的。妇女识字班、青年学习室都一致活跃着，互助组上山干活都带着报纸，村干部上山带上识字牌，又干活又学字。识一千字以上者，即达三十七名，全村八十四个青壮年妇女，只有十一个文盲。青年妇女几几乎都能写上信来，能看通俗报纸，并组织两个报纸通讯组，经常给报纸写稿。由于文化提高的结果，这村的农民不求神拜佛，烧香烧纸了。青年们的婚姻都是自己作主，据最近四年统计，全村已有四十九对男女自由结婚，二十七个单身汉娶了老婆。现在这村充满着和睦友爱、互助的空气，为更美好的生活，大家愉快的劳动着。
