　　Accelerating the Revival of Japanese Armed Forces
    MacArthur Expands Japanese Police Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch] In order to accelerate the revival of Japanese armed forces and use them as tools for American aggression in the Far East, MacArthur issued a directive to the Japanese Yoshida government on the 8th to establish a "National Police Reserve Force" of 75,000 men, in addition to the existing police force, and to increase the maritime police of the "Maritime Safety Agency" by 8,000 men. According to a dispatch from the United Press, MacArthur stated bluntly in his letter to Yoshida: "The relevant departments of this headquarters will provide technical advice and assistance on these measures (referring to the establishment of the 'National Police Reserve Force' and the increase in the number of maritime police officers) in the future." According to Kyodo News, Japanese Minister of Justice Ohashi stated: "The new national police force will be directly under the government and stationed where necessary. This police force is not bound by the Police Law and can carry out necessary activities." Therefore, this new so-called "National Police Reserve Force" has in fact become a more overt Japanese army. Japanese newspapers stated that the expansion of the land and sea police may "require an expenditure of 10 billion yen (approximately US$28.8 million)." Takeo Okubo, Director-General of the "Maritime Safety Agency," openly stated on the 8th that due to the increase in personnel, the number of ships must also be strengthened, "The number of patrol boats must be increased from the current 300 to at least 600" (Kyodo News).

    麦克阿瑟扩充日警
    【新华社十一日讯】麦克阿瑟为加速复活日本武装部队，充任美国侵略远东的工具，八日又指令日本吉田政府在现有的警察部队之外，另建立“国家警察后备队”七万五千人，同时增加“海上保安厅”的海上警察八千人。据合众社讯，麦克阿瑟在他给吉田的信中直言无讳地声称：“本总部的有关部门今后将就这些措施（按指建立‘国家警察后备队’及增加海上警察员额）在技术方面予以建议与协助”。据共同社消息，日法务总裁大桥称：“新的国家警察队直属于政府，置于必要的地方。这一警察队不受警察法约束，可以进行必要的活动。”因此，这一新的所谓“国家警察后备队”事实上已成为更公开的日本陆军。日本报纸称：扩充陆海警察可能“需要支出一百亿日元（按约合二千八百八十余万美元）”。“海上保安厅”厅长大久保武雄于八日公开声称：由于人员的增加，船舰也必须加强，“巡逻艇至少要从现在的三百艘增加到六百艘”（共同社）。
