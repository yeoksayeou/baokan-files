　　Increase Production, Encourage Learning!
    Nanjing Launches Workers' and Youth Literary and Art Movement
    [Report from this newspaper] Over the past six months, the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles has systematically launched a mass literary and art movement focusing on workers and youth. With the cooperation of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles first cultivated a large number of core members from among workers and youth, who became the core force in promoting mass literary and art work. Last December, the city first held workers' singing training classes and youth music training classes, with 178 workers from 48 factories and 184 young people from 60 schools and organizations participating in the study. Last winter vacation, a student music training class was also held, absorbing 130 students. Fifty singing teams have now been organized in factories throughout the city. In the "Red May" workers' singing competition, more than 1,300 workers from 38 factories participated in the performances. Workers' own creations such as "Stevedores' Labor Song," "Postal Workers' Song," and "Postal Workers' Production Song" all won awards of excellence. Before March, various schools had organized a total of 52 singing teams; in March, the city selected representatives from these singing teams to organize the "Nanjing Youth Singing Brigade." Currently, there are 204 members, representing 61 units. In order to review the achievements of workers' and youth music work over the past six months, and in conjunction with the propaganda work of dispersing refugees to return to their hometowns for production and supporting world peace, Nanjing held a joint concert in June. Thirteen units participated in the performance, with more than 600 performers. The vast majority of the programs performed were works depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers. Of the 37 songs performed, 17 were newly created. On June 25, the city also held a children's music and dance performance with the participation of more than 1,000 primary school children. These performances show that musical activities among workers and youth in Nanjing have begun to become popularized. At the same time, a large number of musical creations have emerged. According to incomplete statistics, Nanjing has created a total of 168 songs in the past six months.
    With the help of drama workers, theatrical activities of workers and youth in Nanjing are also gradually developing. The city has successively held workers' waist drum training classes and youth drama training classes. On "May Day" Labor Day, workers throughout the city organized a large waist drum team including more than 1,300 people. Over the past six months, the literary and art troupes of the troops stationed in Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal Art Troupe, the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Arts Office, etc., have successively organized a large number of literary and art workers to go to factories to carry out literary and art activities.
    In addition, workers and youth have also made new achievements in fine arts and literary work. In this year's New Year picture creation movement, many excellent works by workers were discovered. In order to encourage young people's literary and artistic creations, the city held a literary and art prize essay contest in May, and many young people enthusiastically submitted articles.

　　提高生产，鼓励学习！
    南京开展工人青年文艺运动
    【本报讯】南京市文联半年来有计划地开展了以工人、青年为主的群众文艺运动。市文联在市总工会与青年团的配合下，首先从工人与青年中培养了大批骨干分子，成为推动了群众文艺工作的核心。去年十二月，该市首先举办了工人歌咏讲习班和青年音乐讲习班，有四十八个工厂的一百七十八名工人和六十个学校、机关的一百八十四名青年参加了学习。去年寒假又举办了学生音乐讲习班，吸收了学员一百三十人，全市各工厂中现在已组织了五十个歌咏队。在红五月工人歌咏竞赛中，有三十八个工厂的一千三百余工人参加演出。工人自己创作的《搬运劳动歌》、《邮工歌》、《邮工生产歌》等都获得了优等奖。各学校在三月以前共组织了五十二个歌咏队；三月份，该市又在这些歌咏队中选出代表组织了“南京市青年歌咏大队”。现有队员二百零四人，代表六十一个单位。为了检阅半年来工人、青年音乐工作的成绩，并结合疏散难民回乡生产与拥护世界和平的宣传工作。南京市在六月份举行了联合音乐会。参加演出的有十三个单位，演员六百余人。演出的节目绝大部分是表现工农兵的作品。在演出三十七个歌曲中，有十七个是新创作的。六月二十五日，该市并举行了一千余小学儿童参加的儿童音乐舞蹈会。这些演出，说明了南京市工人、青年中的音乐活动已开始走向群众化。同时，音乐创作也大批涌现，据目前不完全统计，半年来南京市共创作了歌曲一百六十八首。
    南京市工人、青年的戏剧活动也在戏剧工作者的帮助下逐渐开展。该市曾先后举办工人腰鼓训练班和青年戏剧讲习班。“五一”劳动节，全市工人曾组织包括一千三百多人的大腰鼓队。半年来，驻南京的部队文工团、南京市文工团、市文联、文艺处等，曾先后组织大批文艺工作者下工厂开展文艺活动。
    此外，工人、青年在美术工作、文学工作等方面也有了新的表现。如今年的新年画创作运动中，发现了许多工人的优秀作品。为了鼓励青年文艺习作，今年五月该市举办了文艺奖金征文，很多青年热烈投稿。
