　　North China United Publishing House
    Reducing Textbook Prices, Improving Supply Methods
    Since the Publication Administration of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government issued the decision on reducing and standardizing the prices and supply methods of textbooks for the autumn of 1950, the North China United Publishing House has decided to abolish the basic pricing of textbooks and discounts for schools and institutions from July 15th. It will switch to RMB pricing, increasing the direct cost from 50.7% to 58%. This calculation can reduce prices by more than 20% compared to the spring. For example, the spring price of a first-grade primary school Chinese textbook was 1,242 yuan (base price 6.9 yuan plus 180 times), while the price for this season is set at 950 yuan, a reduction of 292 yuan. In terms of supply, a unified supply, vertical distribution, and regional responsibility system will be adopted, and allocation will be implemented. This will ensure widespread and timely delivery. Xinhua Bookstore will be responsible for distribution in rural areas. Beijing and Tianjin will be handled directly by the North China United Publishing House. Packaging and shipping costs will be borne by the publisher, and wholesale discounts will be uniformly 20%. In this way, the selling price across the region will be absolutely uniform, so that every reader can buy the same textbook at the same price anywhere in the region.
    Currently, the publishing house is rushing to print autumn textbooks. It is estimated that 12 million copies of books are needed in the entire North China region. The first batch of 9.34 million copies has been sent to printing, produced in the four regions of Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, and Taiyuan. It is expected to be completed by the end of July. The publishing house also adopted the method of printing and distributing simultaneously, and about 3 million copies have already been sent out. The supply of these textbooks to the suburbs of Beijing began on the 15th, organized and distributed by the district culture and education departments.

    减低课本售价  改进供应方法
    自中央人民政府教育部出版总署发布关于一九五○年秋季教科书减低并划一售价及供应办法的决定后，华北联合出版社即决定自七月十五日起取消教科书基本定价及对学校机关读者的折扣，改按人民币计价，将直接成本由百分之五十点七提高为百分之五十八。这样计算可较春季售价减低百分之二十强。如初小一册国语春季售价一千二百四十二元（基价六点九元加一百八十倍），本季定价九百五十元，减低二百九十二元。在供应方面则采取统一供应、垂直发行、分区负责的办法，并实行配售。这样可以做到普遍及时。农村由新华书店负责发行。京津二市由华北联合出版社直接办理。包装运费均由出版者负担，统筹批发一律八折。这样全区售价绝对统一，使每一读者在全区任何地方都能以相等价钱买到同一种课本。
    目前该社正在突击印刷秋季教科书。估计全华北区需书一二○○万册。第一批已发印九三四万册，分由京、津、保、太四地区造货，预计七月底即可全部完成。该社并采取边印边发办法，现已发出约三○○万册。此项教科书京市已于十五日开始向郊区供应，由区文教科组织配售。
