Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: During the week of the peace signature campaign universally held in East China from "July 1st" to "July 7th," the number of signatories has significantly increased. According to recent preliminary statistics, excluding Shanghai, 10,140,000 people in the entire East China region have signed the peace declaration. Among them, 540,000 people in Nanjing, 4,440,000 people in Shandong Province, 1,370,000 people in Zhejiang Province, 1,270,000 people in Fujian Province, 650,000 people in northern Anhui, 640,000 people in southern Anhui, 850,000 people in northern Jiangsu, and 380,000 people in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou and other places in southern Jiangsu.

The movement for safeguarding world peace through signatures in various places has been further expanded and deepened due to the open armed aggression by U.S. imperialism against Korea and our Taiwan. During the week of the peace signature campaign, various mass gatherings were universally held, and other methods were used to strengthen the propaganda for safeguarding world peace, which rapidly developed the movement. For example, 2,300,000 people in Shandong Province signed within a week. Signature stations were set up in major streets and busy areas of Qingdao, and 170,000 people signed within a week. During the week of the peace signature campaign in Nanjing, more than 6,000 people formed propaganda groups and went deep into the neighborhoods to carry out propaganda. Currently, the number of signatures in the city has exceeded more than half of the total population. Residents' groups in neighborhoods in cities such as Wuxi and Suzhou in southern Jiangsu have held peace signature symposiums one after another. The signature movement in rural areas has also been universally launched. In Xintangqiao Village, Wuxi County, 513 farmers signed on July 2nd alone. Currently, 50,000 farmers in the county have signed. In the Huaiyin Prefecture of northern Jiangsu, 60,000 people signed in seven days. In Rugao County, most of the farmers in sixteen townships have signed.

When people signed the peace declaration, they expressed great indignation at the piratical acts of U.S. imperialism's armed aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, and unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely safeguard world peace with practical actions. Sun, an old lady and family member of a martyr in Nanjing, said: "We used an unknown amount of blood to exchange for today's victory, and U.S. imperialism is trying to destroy our peaceful days. We must mobilize more of our children to safeguard world peace by liberating Taiwan." Xu Fuxiang, an old farmer in Yanghucun Village, Yangzhai District, Funing County, northern Jiangsu, said: "Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops burned down my home, and U.S. imperialism is trying to invade us again. We resolutely oppose it to the end. This year, I will be the first to hand in public grain during the summer conscription, ensuring that every grain is dry, to support the army in liberating Taiwan as soon as possible."

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The peace signature campaign in North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region continues to develop rapidly. According to recent preliminary statistics, excluding the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, 3,045,867 people have signed the peace declaration. Among them, 569,825 people in Shanxi Province, 820,000 people in Chahar Province, 220,000 people in Suiyuan Province, 1,000,000 people in Hebei Province, 317,000 people in Pingyuan Province, and 119,042 people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. During the week of the peace declaration signature campaign held in various places from "July 1st" to "July 7th," propaganda in various forms was strengthened, enabling the signature campaign to rapidly and universally launch in small and medium cities and vast rural areas. County and district organs and groups in Hebei Province vigorously organized forces to go deep into rural areas, combining with the current central work, and widely using market fairs, temple fairs, and various small meetings to carry out propaganda. In various rural areas of Chahar Province, signatures were collected during noon breaks or evenings, and the farmers were very enthusiastic in signing. In Zhemeng and Tongliao County of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, after universally holding mass symposiums, more than 18,000 people out of the county's population of more than 30,000 have signed.

　　华东华北及内蒙中小城市和农村
    参加和平签名人数已达一千三百余万
    【新华社上海十五日电】华东各地在“七一”至“七七”普遍举行的和平签名运动周内，签名人数显著增加。据最近的初步统计，全华东区除上海外已有一千零十四万人在和平宣言上签名。其中南京市五十四万人，山东省四百四十四万人，浙江省一百三十七万人，福建省一百二十七万人，皖北六十五万人，皖南六十四万人，苏北八十五万人，苏南无锡、镇江、苏州、常州等地共三十八万人。
    各地的保卫世界和平签名运动，已因美帝国主义公开武装侵略朝鲜和我国台湾而更加扩大和深入。在和平签名周内，各地普遍举行了各种群众性的集会和利用其他方式，加强对保卫世界和平的宣传，使运动迅速发展。如山东省在一周内就有二百三十万人签名。青岛市各主要街头和热闹地区都设立了签名处，一周内有十七万人签名。南京市在和平签名运动周内有六千多人组成了宣传小组，深入里弄进行宣传。现全市签名的已超过人口总数一半以上。苏南无锡、苏州等城市的里弄居民小组纷纷举行了和平签名座谈会。农村中的签名运动也已普遍展开。无锡县新塘桥农民在七月二日一天中即有五百十三人签名，现该县已有五万农民签名。苏北淮阴专区在七天中有六万人签名。如皋县十六个乡大部分的农民已签了名。
    当人们在和平宣言上签名时，对美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜及我国台湾的强盗行为表示极大愤怒，一致表示决以实际行动坚决保卫世界和平。南京市一个烈士家属孙老太太说：“我们用了不知多少鲜血，才换得今天的胜利，而美帝国主义竟想破坏我们的和平日子，我们一定要动员更多的子弟，用解放台湾来保卫世界和平。”苏北阜宁县羊寨区羊胡村的一个老农徐福祥说：“蒋介石匪军把我家烧光了，美帝国主义又想来侵略我们，我们坚决反对到底。今年夏征我头一个缴公粮，保证粒粒干燥，支援大军早日解放台湾。”
    【新华社十五日讯】华北各地及内蒙自治区的和平签名运动继续迅速发展。据最近的初步统计，除北京、天津两市外，已有三百零四万五千八百六十七人在和平宣言上签名。其中山西省五十六万九千八百二十五人，察哈尔省八十二万人，绥远省二十二万人，河北省一百万人，平原省三十一万七千人，内蒙自治区十一万九千零四十二人。各地在“七一”至“七七”举行的和平宣言签名运动周中，加强了各种方式的宣传，使签名运动迅速地在中小城市和广大农村中普遍展开。河北省各县、区机关及团体，大力组织力量深入农村，结合当前中心工作，广泛地利用集市、庙会及各种小型会议进行宣传。察哈尔省各地农村利用中午歇晌或晚间征集签名，农民们签名者非常踊跃。内蒙自治区哲盟、通辽县在普遍举行了群众性的座谈会后，该县三万多人口中，已有一万八千多人签了名。
