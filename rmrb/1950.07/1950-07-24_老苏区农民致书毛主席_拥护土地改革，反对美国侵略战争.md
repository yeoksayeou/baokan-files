To the respected Chairman Mao:

During the land revolution war in 1929, under your leadership, we implemented land reform and eliminated the bloodsuckers who exploited us through land—the landlord class. We lived happily, with enough to eat and wear, and our children were able to attend school. After the Red Army marched north to resist Japan, the Kuomintang bandits once again climbed on our backs, imposing exorbitant taxes and carrying out massacres. The landlord class also staged a comeback, taking back the land we had previously been allocated. Seizing our land was like tearing out our hearts. Dear Chairman Mao, the more the enemy oppressed us, the more we missed you! The frenzied enemy intensified their oppression day by day, conducting "cleanup campaigns" twice every three days, calling us farmers "bandits." They used kerosene to burn, applied lever presses, force-fed pepper water, buried people alive, drowned them, used "thunderbolts" (tying the two thumbs with ropes and hanging them up to be beaten), chopped off fingers, gouged out eyes, used knives to kill, and slowly sliced people to death—methods that were utterly inhumane—to slaughter us. Our houses were torn down by the landlord class and the Kuomintang bandits, and our land, cattle, and farming tools were confiscated. We suffered from hunger and cold, without clothes or food, enduring endless pain.

Dear Chairman Mao, we always thought: you would one day return and lead us to turn over, distribute land, and live a good life. Good news came that your troops were coming soon. Finally, on April 21 last year, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, and on June 21, Ji'an was liberated. When we saw the heroic People's Liberation Army, it was like seeing you. We actively raised grain and borrowed straw to support our own troops and continued to eliminate the enemies who harmed the people. In the year or so since liberation, we have enthusiastically carried out work to support the front, suppress bandits, and oppose local bullies, and we have also actively completed our grain delivery tasks. We know that paying grain is our duty. It is for our own good.

In 1950, we enthusiastically responded to the call for great production. We know that labor is the foundation of happiness. In our township, 11,000 mu of land have generally been plowed three times and harrowed three times; and a quarter of the land has been harrowed four times. Fertilizer application is generally one-third greater than before liberation (the first half of 1949), and in some cases, it is even doubled. Our entire township has also reclaimed 270 mu of wasteland. Although there is a disaster this year and a shortage of grain, under the leadership of the People's Government, we are actively engaged in sideline production: growing vegetables, fishing, collecting firewood, and doing carrying business, etc., to get through the spring famine. Now, our villages are competing with each other to ensure that we get through the summer famine. At the same time, the government has loaned us 20,000 jin of food grain, which has further increased our confidence in overcoming the disaster. We will work harder in production to ensure that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated.

In the July 1st newspaper, we saw the Central People's Government announce the Land Reform Law. We immediately put up blackboards, held discussion meetings, and prepared for celebrations. The day we had been waiting for for more than ten years had arrived. More than ten years ago, the landlords took back our land; today, our land is coming home again! It is right and proper, and absolutely appropriate, for us to distribute the land of the landlord class. In the past, many of our tenant farmers rented land from landlords, and the landlord would charge four baskets of grain (50 jin per basket) per mu of land. The tenant farmer would work hard all year round and get no grain; if the year was bad, they would also owe rent. The landlord would force them to pay the rent every day, driving us to the point of death. We tenant farmers worked hard for a year and only got some by-products—beans—which were not enough to eat. The landlord demanded rent as if they were demanding our lives. We didn't have enough to eat every year, and we were also exploited by usurious loans, so we could never pay off the ever-increasing debt. Now that we can distribute land again and have a good life, how can we not like it! We hope that land reform will be implemented soon. When land reform comes, if anyone opposes us, we will resolutely fight against them without mercy.

After the Land Reform Law was announced, we were extremely happy. We will always follow the Communist Party! We will use labor to realize our production increase plan. We will also unite better to defend world peace. More than 3,500 people in our township have signed the peace petition. We oppose American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan! We oppose American imperialism's aggression against Korea! We will continue to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Tibet, Taiwan, and all territories belonging to China.

Wishing you good health!

All the farmers of Jifu Township, Zhi'ai District, Xiji'an County (formerly Chunhua District, Gonglue County of the Soviet Area)

### 老苏区农民致书毛主席  拥护土地改革，反对美国侵略战争

　　老苏区农民致书毛主席
    拥护土地改革，反对美国侵略战争敬爱的毛主席：
    一九二九年土地革命战争时，我们在你的领导下，实行了土地改革，消灭了靠土地剥削我们的吸血鬼——地主阶级。我们万分高兴地过着幸福的日子。我们有吃有穿，我们的孩子也上了学。自从红军北上抗日后，国民党匪帮就重新骑在我们头上，对我们横征暴敛，大肆屠杀。地主阶级也复辟了，把我们从前分得的田又夺回去。夺了我们的土地，就像剜我们的心一样。亲爱的毛主席：敌人越压迫我们，我们就越想念你！疯狂的敌人一天天加紧压迫我们，三天两次进行“清乡”，说我们农民是“土匪”。他们用煤油烧、压杠子、灌辣椒、活埋、水淹，打地雷公（用绳捆上两个大拇指吊起来毒打）、剁指、剜眼、刀杀、零剐等惨无人道的方法来杀害我们。我们的房屋被地主阶级和国民党匪帮拆掉了，土地耕牛农具被没收了。我们挨饥受冻、无衣无食，受尽了痛苦。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们时刻想：你总有一天会回来，领导我们翻身分田，过好日子。好消息传来，你的队伍快来了。终于，人民解放军在去年四月二十一日渡过了长江，六月二十一日就解放了吉安。我们看到了英勇的人民解放军，就像见到了你。我们积极筹粮借草，支援自己的队伍，继续消灭残害人民的敌人。从解放到现在一年多时间中，我们热烈展开了支前、剿匪、反霸等工作，并且踊跃地完成了缴粮任务。我们知道缴粮是我们应尽的责任。是为了我们自己。
    一九五○年，我们热烈响应大生产号召。我们知道劳动是幸福的基础。我乡一万一千亩田，已普遍作到了三犁三耙；并且有四分之一土地作到四耙。施肥比解放前（一九四九年上半年）普遍多了三分之一，还有多到一倍的。我们全乡还开了二百七十亩荒田。虽然今年有灾荒，缺粮食，但是在人民政府领导下，我们积极搞副业生产：种蔬菜、打鱼、打柴、做肩挑生意等，度过了春荒。现在，我们各村挑战，保证度过夏荒。同时，政府贷给我们二万斤食粮，更增加了我们度过灾荒的信心。我们要更好的劳动生产，保证不荒一亩田。
    在七月一日的报纸上，我们看到中央人民政府公布了土地改革法。我们马上就出了黑板报，举行了座谈会，并且筹备庆祝。我们十余年来时刻盼望着的日子来到了。十余年前，地主夺回了我们的土地；今天，我们的土地又要回家了！我们分地主阶级的田，是理直气壮的，是千该万该、理所应当的。过去我们许多佃户租地主田种，地主每亩田要租谷四箩（每箩五十斤），租田人终年耕种，无谷可得；年头不好，还要欠租。地主天天逼租，逼得我们死去活来；我们佃户辛辛苦苦劳动一年，只得到一些副产品——豆子、还不够吃的。地主要租就是要命。我们年年不够吃，又受高利贷的剥削，怎么着也还不清驴打滚的账。现在我们又能分田，有好日子过了，我们怎能不喜欢！我们希望早日实行土地改革。土地改革的时候，谁要和我们作对，我们就毫不留情地向他作坚决斗争。
    土地改革法公布后，我们万分高兴。我们永远跟着共产党走！我们要用劳动来实现增产计划。我们还要更好的团结起来，保卫世界和平。我们乡有三千五百多人在和平签名书上签了名。我们反对美帝国主义侵略我国台湾！反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜！继续支援解放军解放西藏、台湾和一切属于中国的领土。
    祝你健康！
