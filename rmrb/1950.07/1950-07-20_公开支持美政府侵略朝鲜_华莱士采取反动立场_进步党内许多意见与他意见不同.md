Xinhua News Agency, July 19th—Wallace, of the American Progressive Party, has openly announced his support for the U.S. government's criminal act of armed aggression against Korea. According to Agence France-Presse, South Salem, New York: Wallace declared on the 15th that "when his country is at war and such war is approved by the United Nations, he stands by his country and the United Nations." Despite the fact that the Korean War was instigated by the United States, and that U.S. armed intervention is endangering the independence and security of the Korean people, Wallace actually said that his country "is facing imminent and burning danger for the first time since 1945." Wallace brazenly asserted that "the United States should continue fighting in Korea," which means that American troops should continue to massacre the peaceful people of Korea.

According to a United Press report from New York on the 16th: Progressive Party Secretary Baldwin, commenting on Wallace's actions, pointed out that "the majority of party members within the Progressive Party disagree with him (referring to Wallace) on the Korean issue." Wallace's position on the Korean issue "indicates that the split between Wallace and Progressive Party members has become irreconcilable."

　　公开支持美政府侵略朝鲜
    华莱士采取反动立场
    进步党内许多意见与他意见不同
    【新华社十九日讯】美国进步党华莱士公开宣布支持美国政府武装侵略朝鲜的罪行。据法新社纽约南撒冷讯：华莱士于十五日宣称：“当他的国家处于作战状态而这样的战争又经过联合国的批准时，他就站在他的国家和联合国一边。”尽管朝鲜战争是由美国策动的，而美国的武装干涉正危害着朝鲜人民的独立与安全，但是华莱士竟说：他的国家“自一九四五年以来第一次处在迫在眼前的燃眉的危险中”。华莱士公然主张：“美国应当在朝鲜继续作战”，这就是说，美国军队应该继续去屠杀朝鲜的和平人民。
    据合众社纽约十六日电报道：进步党书记鲍尔温在评论华莱士的行动时指出，进步党党内“多数党员在朝鲜问题上与他（指华莱士）意见不同”。华莱士在朝鲜问题上的立场，“指明华莱士与进步党党员之间的分裂已大得无法补救”。
