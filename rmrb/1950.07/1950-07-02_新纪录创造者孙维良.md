Sun Weiliang, a member of the Songjiang Province Women's Youth League, is only nineteen years old this year, but she has been working by the spinning frame for eight years. In the new record movement in the Northeast Second Textile Factory, she was the first to create a new record. On November 7th of last year, she won the first prize in the factory. On May 25th of this year, at the Second Workers' Congress of Songjiang Province, she was also elected as an alternate member of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.

Sun Weiliang is from Wali Village, Jimo County, Shandong Province. In 1942, her family came to work in a textile factory in Wafangdian, southern Liaoning. Her father pushed bobbins in the coarse spinning department, her brother worked as a maintenance worker (repairman) in the weaving workshop, and her sister watched the machines in the twisting department. The Japanese devils thought Comrade Sun Weiliang was too young and sent her to Zhicheng School to "study" (actually to build roads for the Japanese devils). She was very young and really couldn't do it, so she entered the fine spinning department as an apprentice. When she first started working, she was not even half as tall as the spinning frame. When she needed to take the large bobbins of the machine, she had to step on the machine's foot. If she wasn't careful and the thread broke, she would be brutally beaten by the Japanese devils. In these difficult days, she developed a strong hatred for the enemy and also learned to treat the enemy by frequently asking for leave, being absent from work, and damaging machine parts.

In the spring of 1948, the textile factory returned to the hands of the people. But at that time, she did not realize that the working class had turned over and become the masters of the house, and she still worked with the old attitude. She had a skillful technique, but she was unwilling to use it. She could have watched one machine, but she only watched seventy skeins (one machine is one hundred and ten skeins, each skein has four spindles). Later, through the education of the Party and Youth League organizations in the factory, she raised her awareness. At the end of October last year, the textile department of the factory partially suspended work to wait for materials, organized workers to carry out cultural and political studies, paid 70% of the wages as usual, and distributed one ton of coal to each worker. This fact aroused Sun Weiliang's infinite emotion. She remembered the suffering of the workers under the rule of the Japanese devils, and couldn't help but blame herself: "The Communist Party is worthy of me, but I am not worthy of the Communist Party!"

In October last year, the new record movement was launched in the factory in a vigorous manner. The administration called on everyone: "To give play to the wisdom of the working class, actively create new production records, improve production efficiency, and turn the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country." After hearing this call, Sun Weiliang planned to increase the number of machines she watched. She arrived at the factory very early every day before work, carefully checked the machines, and often cleaned the machines, wiped the rear panels and the waste cotton of each wool rod, so as to prevent the waste cotton from flying onto the thread skeins, affecting the quality of the product, and increasing the number of breaks.

During the intense new record movement, her right eye went bad. She was very anxious. The administrator, Ji Hongzhen, advised her to go back and rest for a few days. She was unwilling and insisted on working. Later, her right eye was really unable to open, so she had to listen to the administrator and go home to rest for five days.

During these five days, she was extremely anxious. Before her eyes were completely healed, she went back to work in the factory. She heard others say: "Huang Shifu and Xu Yunlai are watching two and a half machines."

The first morning, the assistant told Sun Weiliang: "This time, you should give full play to your ability. I guarantee that there will be no accidents with the machine." Sun Weiliang nervously picked up the thread with one hand and selected cotton with the other, and her eyes had to stare at the 1,320 spindles, not allowing the thread of each spindle to break, and not allowing each spindle to lint. The assistant also correctly grasped the temperature and humidity in the room, so as not to cause the thread to lint and break. As a result, Sun Weiliang saw three spinning frames (note: the machines are Toyo-style), totaling 1,320 spindles, creating a new record that increased work efficiency by two times compared to September (note: according to the materials of Shanghai China Textile Company in 1947, one person could only watch two machines at most).

Sun Weiliang realized her plan and won the first prize in the factory. She thought that one person's strength was very small, and she should help more people. After she finished her work, she helped others with tasks such as arranging bobbins. Under her influence, five new record movers emerged in the fine spinning department, watching two to three machines instead of one and a half.

　　新纪录创造者孙维良
    潘国华
    松江省女青年团员孙维良，今年才十九岁，可是在精纺机旁已经工作八年了。在东北第二纺织厂的新纪录运动中，她第一个创造了新纪录。去年十一月七日，荣获厂里的一等奖。今年五月二十五日，在松江省二届工代大会上，她又被选为省总工会的候补委员。
    孙维良是山东省即墨县洼里村人。一九四二年，她一家人到了辽南瓦房店一个纺织厂里做工。她爸爸在粗纺部里推穗子，哥哥在织布场里当保全工（修理工），姐姐在捻丝部看机台。日本鬼子嫌孙维良同志小，送她到至诚学校“念书”（其实为日本鬼子修大道）。她年纪很小，实在干不下去，便入了精纺部当学徒工。刚开始工作时，她个子还没有精纺机的一半高，要拿机台工的大穗子时，还得踏在机台脚上。一不小心，线断了头，就要挨日本鬼子的毒打。在这些苦难的日子里，她养成了一副强烈仇视敌人的性格，也学会了经常用请假、旷工、破坏机器零件等手段来对待敌人。
    一九四八年春，纺织厂回到了人民的手里。但她那时还没有意识到工人阶级已经翻身作了主人，仍然用旧的态度工作。她有一手熟练的技术，却不愿拿出来，本来能看一台，偏只看七十捧（一台是一百一十捧，每捧四个锭）。后来经过厂里党、团组织的教育，她提高了觉悟。去年十月末，厂里纺织部部分停工待料，组织工人展开了文化、政治学习，工资照发百分之七十，并发每个工友一吨煤。这件事实，引起了孙维良的无限感触。她想起工人们在日本鬼统治下所受的苦处，不禁责备自己：“共产党对得起我，可是我却对不起共产党！”
    去年十月间，新纪录运动在厂里轰轰烈烈地展开了。行政上号召大家：“要发挥工人阶级的智慧，积极地创造生产新纪录，提高生产效率，把落后的农业国变成先进的工业国。”孙维良听了这个号召，便计划提高看机车台数。她每天在上班前很早就到厂，仔细地把机台检查一遍，并且经常打扫机台，擦洗后车板和各个毛棒的废棉，以免开车时废棉飞到线穗上，影响产品的质量，增加断头。
    正在紧张的新纪录运动中，她的右眼睛坏了。她心里很焦燥。管理员纪宏珍劝她回去歇几天。她不愿意，还是坚持着干。后来她右眼睛实在睁不开了，只好听管理员的话，回家歇了五天。
    这五天当中，她心里急得了不得。在眼睛还没有完全好，她又到厂工作了。她听到别人说：“黄士福、徐云来看两台半。”
    头一天早上，助理员告诉孙维良：“这回你好好的发挥能力吧，我保证机器不出事故。”孙维良就紧张地一只手接头一只手择棉花，眼睛还要盯住那一千三百二十个锭子，不使每一个锭子的线断头，不使每一个锭子起毛。助理员也正确地掌握住室内的温度、湿度，不使线起毛断头。结果孙维良看到三台精纺机（按：机器是东洋丰式），计有一千三百二十锭子，创造了比九月份提高工作效率二倍的新纪录（按：根据一九四七年上海中纺公司的材料，一人最多只能看到二台）。
    孙维良实现了自己的计划，荣获厂里一等奖金。她想一个人的力量很小，应当帮助更多的人。她自己完了活计后，就帮助别人摆棒子等工作。在她的影响下，精纺部又涌现了五名由一台半看到二台至三台的新纪录运动者。
