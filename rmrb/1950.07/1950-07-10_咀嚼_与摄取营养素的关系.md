The Relationship Between "Chewing" and Nutrient Intake
Beijing Municipal Dental Hospital Sun Pengju

The issue of nutrient intake in the human body generally focuses on the nutrients contained in the food itself. This view is of course correct. However, more attention should be paid to the human body's ability to absorb these nutrients. If a food is rich in certain nutrients but cannot be fully absorbed into the body, it loses its nutritional value. Even if the nutrients in the food are not very rich, we can obtain greater benefits if we can fully absorb them into the body. Therefore, it is most ideal to have nutritious food and to fully absorb it.

The human body's intake of nutrients from food generally involves two processes: the first is the digestion process of food, and the second is the absorption process of digested food.

What is the digestion process? - Food entering the body cannot be directly absorbed by the intestines and must first undergo a processing. This processing transforms the food from large pieces to small pieces, and from complex to simple, so that it can be absorbed by the intestines. This process of transforming food is called digestion. Digestion includes two functions: one is the physical digestion of food (such as grinding, squeezing, stirring, and other mechanical processing of food), and the other is the chemical digestion of food (various parts of the mouth, stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas secrete fluids that can digest food, called digestive juices. Digestive juices can break down food, changing it from complex structures to simple structures).

What is the absorption process? - That is, the nutrients in the already digested food are absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, enter blood vessels or lymphatic vessels, and then are indirectly transported to various tissues and cells of the human body to supply the needs of tissue cells.

As mentioned above, the absorption of food by the intestine must first go through the digestion process, so the absorption situation depends on the digestion situation of the food. Digestion includes physical digestion and chemical digestion. However, the normal function of chemical digestion is similar for everyone. What determines the different absorption amounts for each person is mostly based on physical digestion. Physical digestion includes chewing in the mouth and the movement of the stomach and intestines. However, the motor functions of the stomach and intestines are also not very different between individuals. As a result, the biggest difference in the physical digestion process is the chewing function of the mouth.

Chewing - is the process in which food enters the mouth, is first cut into small pieces by the incisors, and then the tongue sends the food between the upper and lower molars to be ground. This process is completed by the cooperative movement of the teeth, muscles around the mouth, and the tongue. Teeth are the hardest organs in the human body, and chewing muscles have great chewing power, and the movement of muscles and the tongue can be controlled by human will. With the above three characteristics, chewing has a particularly large mechanical effect on food. If the human body does not have this mechanism, it will not be easy to fully digest certain foods. For example, we can often find some undigested things in children's feces (such as old corn, soybeans, peanuts, etc.).

Generally, if food is well chewed, it is changed from large pieces to crushed pieces, and then to small fine particles. This continues to increase the area of contact between the food and digestive juices (increasing physical digestion), which increases the chance of digestive juices breaking down the food (increasing chemical digestion). Therefore, the nutrients in the food are fully broken down by digestive juices in the mouth, stomach, and intestines, so that the amount absorbed in the intestines can be increased.

For example, the nutritional value of "92" rice is higher than that of refined white rice, because "92" rice has added part of the aleurone layer and bran. However, the bran contains some coarse fibers, which are not easily digested in the stomach and intestines if they are not well chewed and ground, so the nutrients it contains cannot be fully absorbed into the human body.

Now use a diagram to explain. For example, a grain of "92" rice is divided into several layers, and the types and amounts of nutrients contained in each layer are different. Many articles have been published in the newspaper, so I will not describe them in detail. In the diagram, I is the bran, II is the aleurone layer, III is the rice embryo, IV is the rice kernel, and ↓ is the symbol of digestive juice.

Figure 1 shows a complete grain of rice that has not been chewed. Digestive juice can only contact the surface of layer I. Only after layer I is broken down can it contact layer II. Therefore, it is often excreted before it can be broken down to the inner layer, thus losing the nutrients contained in layer IV, and even part of the nutrients in layers II and III.

Figure 2 shows a grain of rice that is not fully chewed. Because it has been bitten open, the inner parts are also exposed, increasing the area of contact with digestive juice, so the degree of digestion is more complete than the former.

Figure 3 shows a grain of rice that has been completely chewed and crushed. Each small part of each layer is completely exposed, and the area of contact with digestive juice is further increased. Therefore, the nutrients in each small part can be easily and fully broken down by digestive juice, achieving the greatest digestive effect.

Sufficient chewing can not only directly increase digestion, but also stimulate an increase in some digestive juices (such as saliva and gastric juice), indirectly increasing digestion. The relationship between chewing and nutrient absorption is illustrated below with an experimental example:

A certain university once asked several young people to do an experiment on chewing and nutrient absorption. The first day of the experiment was to have them chew a certain amount of food as repeatedly as possible. The second day of the experiment was to eat the same amount of food at the fastest speed (so-called gobbling). The amount of food and the number of chews for the two times are shown in the following table:

Food	Serving Size	Number of Fine Chews per Bite	Number of Coarse Chews per Bite
White Rice	450 grams	50-60 times	5-7 times
Pork	60 grams	100-130 times	19-23 times
Eggplant	80 grams	55-65 times	9-17 times
Salted Radish	10 grams	80-110 times	13-17 times

Then, analyze the feces excreted in these two times. The difference in the amount absorbed by the human body is shown in the following table:

Nutrient	Amount Absorbed by Fine Chewing	Amount Absorbed by Coarse Chewing	Difference
Protein	85.37%	71.96%	13.41%
Fat	83.10%	71.26%	11.84%
Carbohydrates	99.40%	88.45%	10.95%
Cellulose	79.59%	36.97%	41.62%

From the above experiment, we can clearly see the effects of coarse chewing and fine chewing, that is, the different degrees of chewing obviously affect the absorption relationship.

Therefore, if we do not chew "92" rice carefully, some of the rice grains may not be ground, or even not bitten at all, and still remain in their original state. In this way, naturally many nutrients will not be absorbed and will be excreted in vain, reducing the nutrients that we should have obtained from "92" rice. (Attached picture)

The first picture is a whole grain of rice with only the outer layer in contact with digestive juice.
The second picture shows a bitten-open grain of rice, where not only the outer layer but also the inner layer can be in contact with digestive juice.
The third picture shows a grain of rice that has been chewed into powder, where every small part can be in direct contact with digestive juice. The ○ in the picture represents small particles, and 1234 represent each layer.

　　“咀嚼”与摄取营养素的关系
    北京市立牙科医院  孙鹏举
    人体摄取营养的问题，一般的都是着重在食物本体所含有的营养素方面，这种看法当然是对的。但是更应注意的是，人体对于这些营养素的摄取能力如何。假如某一些营养素很丰富的食物，而不能充分地把它完全吸收入体内，那就失去了营养的价值。即使食物中的营养素不甚丰富，我们如能将它完全摄取至体内，也可以获得更大的益处。所以既有了营养丰富的食物，更要把它完全摄取，那才是最合理想的。
    人体摄取食物中的营养素——普通要有两个过程，第一个是对食物的消化过程，第二个是对消化过的食物加以吸收的过程。
    什么是消化过程呢？——食物进入体内不能直接被肠吸收，必需先经过一次加工，由于这次加工把食物由大块变成小块，由复杂变成单纯，以后才能被肠吸收，这个改造食物的过程叫做消化。消化包括了两种作用，一个是对食物的物理消化作用（如对食物磨碎、压榨、搅拌、……等机械的加工。）另一个是对食物的化学消化作用（自口腔、胃、肠、肝、胰各部分泌出一些能消化食物的液体叫消化液，消化液可以将食物分解，由复杂的构造改变成单纯的构造。）
    什么叫吸收过程呢？——即是将已经消化过食物中的营养素被肠粘膜吸收，入血管或淋巴管内，再间接的运至人体各部组织细胞中，以供给组织细胞需要的。
    如上所述，肠对于食物的吸收，必须先经过消化的过程，所以吸收的情形如何，就要看食物的消化情形如何来决定。消化，一方面是物理的消化作用，另一方是化学的消化作用，但是化学的消化作用，每个人正常的机能都是差不多的，能够决定每个人吸收量不同的，多半根据于物理的消化作用。物理的消化作用包括了口腔的咀嚼与胃、肠的运动，然而胃、肠的运动机能，各个人之间也无大差别，结果在物理的消化过程中相差最大的，就是口腔咀嚼的机能。
    咀嚼——是当食物进入口腔，先由门齿切成小块，然后再由舌把食物送至上下臼齿之间磨碎的过程。这个过程是由于牙齿、口腔周围筋肉及舌的合作运动而完成的。牙齿是人体最坚硬的器官，同时咀嚼筋肉具有很大的咀嚼力量，并且筋肉及舌的运动可以受人意志的支配。有上面三个特点，所以咀嚼对于食物机械的作用是特别大的。假如人体没有这种机构，对于某一些食物即将不容易完全消化。譬如我们常可以自儿童的粪便中找出一些未完全消化的东西（如老玉米、黄豆、花生米等等）。
    一般的食物，如果经过良好的咀嚼，由大块变成碎块，再变成小的细粒，这样就继续增大了食物与消化液接触的面积（物理的消化作用增大），就增大了消化液对食物分解的机会（化学的消化作用增大），所以食物中的营养素在口腔、胃、肠中充分地被消化液分解了，因此在肠中被吸收的量才能增多。
    例如“九二”米的营养价比精白米的营养价高，因为“九二”米多添了一部分的胶层及糠皮。但是糠皮内含有一些粗的纤维，如果不经过良好的咀嚼、磨碎，至胃肠中是不易被消化的，那么就不能把它所含有的营养素充分地摄取到人体内。
    现在用图来解释一下。例如一粒“九二”米，共分数层，每层中所含有营养素的种类及量都不同，在报上已有许多文章发表，不再详述。图上的Ⅰ为糠皮，Ⅱ为胶层，Ⅲ为米胚，Ⅳ为米仁，↓为消化液的记号。
    图一、是一粒未经咀嚼的完整米粒。消化液只能接触到Ⅰ层的表面，要Ⅰ层分解以后才能接触到Ⅱ层，所以常常未得分解至内层以前就已被排泄出去，这样就损失了Ⅳ层中所含的营养素，甚至ⅡⅢ两层一部分的营养素。
    图二、是一粒咀嚼不充分的米粒，因为咬开了，里面的部分也都露出，增加了与消化液接触的面，这样比前者被消化的程度也比较充分一些。
    图三、是已完全被咀嚼碎的米粒，每层的各小部分，均完全露出，与消化液接触的面更加增大了。因此每一小部分中的营养素都很容易被消化液充分的分解，达成最大的消化作用。
    充分的咀嚼，不但能直接的增大消化作用，同时它可以刺激一部分消化液的增多（如唾液与胃液），间接的也增大了消化作用。兹把咀嚼与营养吸收的关系用一个实验的例子说明如下：
    某大学，曾请几个青年作过一次咀嚼与营养吸收的实验。第一天的实验是令他们对一定量的食物尽可能反复咀嚼。第二天的实验是将同量的食物，以最快的速度吃下去（所谓狼吞虎咽），食物的数量及两次的咀嚼次数如次表：
    食物  一顿饭分量   每口细咀嚼次数   每口粗咀嚼次数
    白米  四五○克  五○—六○次  五—七次
    猪肉  六○克  一○○—一三○次  一九—二三次
    茄子  八○克  五五—六五次  九—十七次
    咸萝卜  一○克  八○—一一○次  一三—十七次
    然后分析这两次所排出的粪便，人体所得吸收量结果的不同如次表：
    营养素  细嚼人体吸收量  粗嚼人体吸收量  比较差量
    蛋白质  八五·三七％  七一·九六％  一三·四一％
    脂肪  八三·一○％   七一·二六％  一一·八四％
    岩水化物  九九·四○％  八八·四五％  一○·九五％
    纤维素  七九·五九％   三六·九七％   四一·六二％
    由于以上的实验，我们能够清楚地看出粗嚼与细嚼的效果，也就是咀嚼的程度不同，显然地影响了吸收的关系。
    所以我们对于“九二”米不经过细细的咀嚼，可能有一部分米粒未磨碎，甚至根本未咬到，仍保持原来的状态，这样自然就有很多的营养素未被吸收，而白白的排泄出去，减少了我们对于“九二”米应该摄取到的营养素。（附图片）
    第一图  是一粒整米只外层与消化液接触
    第二图  一粒咬破的米不但外层即内层也可以与消化液接触
    第三图  一粒咬得粉碎的米每小部分都可以直接与消化液接触。图内的○是粉碎的小颗粒1234代表各层
