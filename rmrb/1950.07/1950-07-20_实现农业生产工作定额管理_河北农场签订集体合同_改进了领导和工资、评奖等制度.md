　　Implementing Agricultural Production Quota Management
    Hebei Farm Signs Collective Contract 
    Improved Leadership, Wages, and Award Systems
    [This newspaper's Shijiazhuang News] Special Correspondent Zhou Ziqin reports: Shijiazhuang's Hebei Farm signed a production collective contract in early April of this year. This is a significant measure and improvement in the farm's operations over the past year or so. The purpose of the contract is to implement democratic management, implement economic accounting, and develop production.
    Over the past year or so, Hebei Farm has gradually embarked on a more normal and reasonable path in its management work through continuous improvements. First, through land consolidation, repairing and filling ditches and roads, and changing the original land division, small plots were transformed into large plots, and the cultivation methods of dispersed small-scale agricultural production were changed into large-scale farming production methods. In the organization of labor, a unified group management system was adopted to centralize leadership and unify command, in order to leverage the strength of cooperation and mutual assistance. In terms of leadership methods, the past style of bureaucracy and paternalistic control was reviewed and criticized, and changed to division of labor and responsibility, promoting democracy, and relying on workers. At the same time, the farm underwent several large-scale production blitzes, and the workers' discipline and organization gradually improved, and labor efficiency had a relatively obvious quota. This laid a preliminary foundation for signing the contract.
    In early April of this year, the farm, with reference to the experience of various industrial and mining enterprises in formulating collective contracts, combined with its own specific situation, and based on the principle of "considering both public and private interests, and developing production," signed a democratic and mass-based collective contract with the farm workers. The main content of the contract is the implementation of a rational wage system and quota management, and an incentive system of bonus distribution for exceeding quotas. Specific content: 1. Seven-level wage system. The farm's wage system last year was an egalitarian wage system, with many levels (thirteen levels) and small differences (only five catties of millet difference between each level), which could not stimulate improvements in production technology. In order to correct the above shortcomings, the farm studied the successful experience of wage systems in various enterprises in Northeast China, and decided to adopt a seven-level wage system based on the principle of "to each according to his work." 2. Quota output, bonus distribution for exceeding quotas. Quota output is limited to the main crops propagated by the farm (cotton, wheat, grain, sweet potatoes, corn, lentils). Sideline occupations and vegetable cultivation are not yet subject to quota management, in order to gain experience and then expand promotion. The standard for output quotas is calculated at 70% of the average annual output. This is because, according to past economic accounting, the output must be above 70% of the average annual output in order to be profitable. Over the quota will be rewarded with bonus distribution, which is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. This kind of bonus is distributed to all workers. When distributing to each worker, the bonus is progressively awarded based on the usual performance. 3. Quota efficiency, bonuses for exceeding quotas. This is a direct reward for each individual producer who exceeds the quota. It is also limited to various operations of several major crops in the output quota. The standard is based on the farm's specific conditions, neither too high nor too low. If it is too high, workers will not easily accept it and will reduce their enthusiasm for production; if it is too low, it will not improve the workers' enthusiasm, and the quota will be meaningless. After exceeding the efficiency quota, awards should be evaluated, and they must be evaluated by the masses themselves. However, in the output quota, it should generally be higher than the farmer's level, because the farm's production conditions are superior to those of ordinary farmers. After this incentive system is established, in addition to a fixed wage, workers can also receive bonuses and awards for exceeding the quota, and their enthusiasm for production and work is very high.

　　实现农业生产工作定额管理
    河北农场签订集体合同 
    改进了领导和工资、评奖等制度
    【本报石家庄讯】特派记者周子芹报道：石家庄河北农场于本年四月初签订了生产集体合同。这是该场一年多以来在农场经营上一个重大的措施和改进。合同的目的，是为了贯彻民主管理，实行经济核算，发展生产。
    河北农场过去一年多来，在管理工作上，经过了不断的改进，已逐步走上了比较正常和合理的道路。首先经过土地整理，修填沟壕道路，改变原有土地区划，变小块为大块，将分散的小农生产的耕作方法，改变成为大耕作制的生产方法。在劳动力的组织上，采用分组的统一管理制，使领导集中，指挥统一，以发挥合作互助的力量。在领导方法上，则检讨和批判了过去事务主义、包办代替的作风，改变为分工负责，发扬民主，依靠工人。同时，该场经过了几次大规模的生产突击运动，工人的纪律性和组织性都逐渐提高，劳动效率有了比较明显的定额。给签订合同奠立了初步的基础。
    今年四月初，该场便参考了各地工矿企业订立集体合同的经验，结合本场具体情况，根据“公私兼顾，发展生产”的原则，与该场工人签订了民主的、群众性的集体合同。合同的主要内容为实施合理的工资制度及定额管理、超额分红的奖励制度。具体内容：一、七级工资制。该场去年的工资制度是一种平均主义的工资制度，等级多（十三级），差额小（每级差额之间只差五斤小米），不能刺激生产技术上的改进。农场为了纠正以上缺点，研究了东北各企业工资制度的成功经验，根据“按劳取酬”的原则，决定采用七级工资制度。二、定额产量，超额分红制。定额产量是以农场繁殖的主要作物（棉、麦、谷、甘薯、玉米、扁豆）为限。副业及蔬菜栽培均暂不实行定额管理，以便取得经验后，再行扩大推广。产量定额标准，按平年产量的七成计算。因为根据过去经济核算，产量须在平年七成以上，经营才能获利。超过定额则予以分红的奖励，这对公私双方都有好处。这种分红，是分给全体工人的。在分给每个工人时，则是根据平时工作好坏评定累进给奖。三、定额效率，超额奖励。这是直接奖励给每个超额生产者个人的奖励。也以产量定额中的几种主要作物之各种作业为限。其标准是根据农场的具体条件，不过高，也不过低。过高了工人不容易接受，且会减低其生产热情；过低了就不能提高工人的积极性，定额就没有意义。超过效率定额之后，便应评奖，且必须经群众自己评定。但在定额产量中，一般应高于农家水平，因为农场的生产条件比一般农民为优越。这种奖励制度定出后，工人除一定工资之外，还可因超额得到分红和奖金，生产积极性和工作情绪都很高。
