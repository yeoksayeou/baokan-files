More than 50 Hui people from Landianchang in the western suburbs specially took three large carts from 30 miles away to participate. Ma Yuhuai (Hui), Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau, attended and delivered a speech. He gave a detailed analysis of the current international situation and the glorious history of the Hui people and other fraternal ethnic groups in the country uniting as one to win the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation over the past 13 years. He said: We, the Hui people, are determined to unite with all fraternal ethnic groups under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to defend world peace; we have full confidence and assurance to consolidate and defend our victory. Wang Lianyu, imam of the Niujie Mosque, spoke at the meeting, saying: We, the Hui people, like other fraternal ethnic groups, always advocate peace and justice. We will definitely contribute all our strength to support the People's Liberation Army in defeating American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, and liberate Taiwan. Yang Yisan, the Hui representative to the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, used his personal experience to describe the devastation and persecution he suffered when Japanese imperialism occupied Beijing. He said that we and the people of the world can no longer tolerate imperialist aggression, and we all sign our names to support and defend world peace. We unite with the peace-loving people of the world, and we have the strength to stop and repel all provocations by imperialists and war-mongers. The conference ended at 1 p.m., and more than 3,000 people who attended the meeting enthusiastically signed the peace declaration.
