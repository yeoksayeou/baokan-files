　　The Government Administration Council promulgated
    Measures for Retaining Land Along Railway Lines
    All Railway Bureaus Have Received Orders to Comply

    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] The Central People's Government Administration Council promulgated the "Measures for Retaining Land Along Railway Lines" on June 24th, ordering the Ministry of Railways to comply. The measures stipulate that for railway subgrades with a height of 3 meters or less, double-track lines should retain 30 meters of land on each side from the center of the line, single-track lines should retain 20 meters of land on each side from the center of the track, and railway bridgeheads should retain 60 meters of land on each side. For bridgeheads and subgrades in special terrain, and for subgrades with a height exceeding 3 meters, land should be increased according to actual needs. For original railway subgrade properties that have not been damaged and can be verified, the original land boundaries should still be retained. If land along railway lines with records and maps was mistakenly distributed during land reform, the local government should exchange it with public land or other land and return the railway land. Before destroyed lines are repaired, and before lines that have been surveyed but not yet laid are laid, the land should be retained according to the original boundaries. However, within the scope of not damaging the original engineering, the local government may use it for production, and the railway will reclaim it when it is used. When the railway decides to use the land, it should notify the recovery as much as possible before sowing. If sowing has already taken place, and recovery is urgent, appropriate subsidies should be given, depending on the living conditions of the cultivators. The original land of railway stations, sections, yards (including farms, forest farms, pastures, etc.), factories, and institutes, etc., should be retained according to the original boundaries. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Railways has ordered its directly affiliated units and all railway bureaus across the country to comply.

　　政务院颁布
    铁路沿线留用土地办法
    各铁路局已奉令遵照执行
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府政务院于六月二十四日颁布铁路留用土地办法，令铁道部遵照执行。该办法规定铁路路基高度在三公尺以内者，双轨线自线路中心起，两旁各留地三十公尺，单轨线自轨道中心起，两旁各留地二十公尺，铁路大桥头两旁各留地六十公尺。特殊地形的桥头及路基，与路基高度超过三公尺者，按实际需要增加用地。原有铁路路基地产未经破毁有案可稽者，仍照原旧地界留除。土地改革时误将沿线铁路有案有图可考的土地分配者，由地方政府以公地或其他土地交换，将铁路土地交还。被毁线路在未修复前，及已测定尚未敷轨的线路在敷线前，其土地均应照原界保留，但在不损害原有工程范围内，可由地方政府利用生产，铁路使用时再行收回。铁路决定使用该地时，应尽可能于播种前通知收回，如已播种，因使用急迫收回时，视耕种者的生活状况，有补助必要者，酌予补助。铁路原有站、段、场（包括农场、林场、牧场等）、厂、所等用地仍照原界予以保留。铁道部奉令后已令该部直属单位及全国各路局遵照执行。
