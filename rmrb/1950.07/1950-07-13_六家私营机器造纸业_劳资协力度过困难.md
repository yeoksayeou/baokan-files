　　Six Private Machine-Made Paper Mills:
    Labor-Management Cooperation Overcomes Difficulties
    [Our Newspaper] There are six private machine-made paper mills in Beijing. Due to slow sales of their products, all of them suspended operations in April. After the shutdown, neither labor nor management was able to come up with timely solutions. The management adopted a passive wait-and-see attitude, while the workers were unwilling to make appropriate concessions on wages, and the situation became increasingly serious. In early May, under the leadership of the Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, preparations began to establish a labor-management consultation meeting, where both sides exchanged views on how to overcome the current difficulties. On May 20, the labor and management of the Beijing Paper Mill formally signed a temporary agreement. The main contents of the agreement are: during the shutdown period, in addition to the provision of food by the management, wages will be paid at 25% of the original wage. Four workers will take turns returning home. The management guarantees to operate at half capacity for three months from June 1 to September 1. During this period, wages for working days will be paid in full, and 25% will be paid for non-working days. If the number of working days is less than 45 days in the three months, the management must also pay wages as stipulated; if it exceeds 45 days, it will be calculated based on the actual number of working days. After September 1, efforts will be made to resume full operation. In addition, employee benefits, such as food, haircuts, and medical expenses, have been appropriately reduced. After the agreement was signed, the management gained confidence in overcoming difficulties and actively planned to resume work. They resumed work early on May 24.
    The labor-management temporary agreement for the Beiyang Paper Mill was also signed on May 25. The agreement stipulates that the shutdown period is temporarily for the three months of May, June, and July, during which wages will be halved. Except for seven people retained to look after the factory, the remaining employees can return home. If it is impossible to resume work when the agreement expires, labor and management will negotiate separately before the expiration; if work can be resumed, the original wages will be restored from the date of resumption.
    In addition, Yihe and Chuqi Paper Mills have also established labor-management consultation meetings and have signed agreements.

　　六家私营机器造纸业
    劳资协力度过困难
    【本报讯】京市私营机器造纸业共六家，因为产品滞销，均于四月相继停工。停工后劳资双方都未能及时想办法，资方是消极观望，工友们不愿意在待遇上作适当的让步，情况愈来愈严重。五月初，在劳动局及市总工会的领导下，开始酝酿成立劳资协商会议，劳资双方交换了度过目前困难的意见。五月二十日，北京造纸厂劳资双方正式签订了临时协议。协议的主要内容是：停工期间，除资方供给伙食外，工资照原工资的百分之二十五发给。并有四个工人轮流回家。资方保证从六月一日至九月一日三个月中开半工。在此期间，工作日工资照全数发给，停工日发给百分之二十五。如果三个月中开工不到四十五天，资方也得照规定付给工资；如超过四十五天，则按实际工作日数计算。九月一日以后，争取全部开工。此外，职工的福利方面，如伙食、理发、医药费等均适当的降低了。协议签订后，资方对克服困难有了信心，积极筹划复工。五月二十四日就提早复工了。
    北洋造纸厂的劳资临时协议也在五月二十五日签订了。协议中规定停工期间暂为五、六、七三个月，在此期间内，工资折半发给。除留用七人看厂外，其余职工可回家。协议期满时，如无法复工，由劳资双方于期满前另行协商；如能复工，自复工日起，恢复原来工资。
    此外义和、初起造纸厂也跟着成立了劳资协商会议，并已签订协定。
