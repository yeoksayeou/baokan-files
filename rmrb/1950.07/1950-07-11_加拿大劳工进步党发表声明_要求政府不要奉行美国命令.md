Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, July 8th (TASS): The Executive Committee of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada has issued a statement condemning the United States' intervention in Korea. The statement emphasizes: The Korean incident was deliberately arranged by the American reactionaries, who are trying their best to use these incidents to realize their imperialist conspiracy in the Far East.

The statement said: The United Nations Security Council has been turned into the US Security Council by the use of the dollar. The resolution passed by the Security Council at the instigation of Truman, and in the absence of representatives from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, is illegal and violates the United Nations Charter.

The Executive Committee of the Labor Progressive Party demands that the Canadian government not follow the orders of the United States, and not fuel the threat to peace, but should uphold the United Nations Charter, support the admission of representatives of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, and thereby confirm that Canada is independent and autonomous.

The Executive Committee calls on the Canadian government to stand up and call for the prohibition of atomic weapons, to declare the government that first uses atomic weapons as a war criminal, and to call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

　　加拿大劳工进步党发表声明
    要求政府不要奉行美国命令
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社渥太华八日讯：加拿大劳工进步党执行委员会发表声明，抨击美国干涉朝鲜。声明强调指出：朝鲜事件是美国反动派蓄意布置的，并竭力利用这些事件来实现他们帝国主义者对远东的阴谋计划。
    声明中说：联合国的安理会已被人运用美元而变成了美国的安理会。安理会由杜鲁门授意、在苏联和中华人民共和国的代表们缺席的时候所通过的决议，是不合法的，是违反联合国宪章的。
    劳工进步党执行委员会要求加拿大政府，不要奉行美国的命令，助长对和平的威胁，而应维护联合国宪章，支持中华人民共和国的代表加入联合国，由此确证加拿大是独立自主的。
    执行委员会要求加拿大政府起来呼吁禁止原子武器，将第一个使用原子武器的政府宣布为战争罪犯，并且要求呼吁一切外国军队退出朝鲜。
