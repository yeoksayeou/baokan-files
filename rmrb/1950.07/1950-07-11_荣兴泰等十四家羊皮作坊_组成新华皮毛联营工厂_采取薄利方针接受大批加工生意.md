　　Rongxingtai and Fourteen Other Sheepskin Workshops
    Form Xinhua Leather United Factory
    Adopting a Small Profits Policy to Accept Large Quantities of Processing Business
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The Xinhua Leather First United Factory, formed by fourteen sheepskin workshops including Rongtaixing and Changshengyuan in Kyoto, officially started operations on June 4th. It has already accepted two batches of processing work from the Zhangjiakou Office of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region and the First Leather Factory, totaling more than 32,000 various hides, with processing fees amounting to more than 30,000 jin of millet (yielding a profit of 10% to 20%). Before the joint operation, each of the fourteen workshops was operated by the owner with one or two apprentices. Manpower was weak, funds were short, and they could not undertake large-scale work. Business was poor last year. After the joint operation, manpower and funds were concentrated, which is an improvement over decentralized operations. Shareholders of each factory participating in the joint operation have participated in management or production. To take care of the financial difficulties of shareholders' families, each person can temporarily receive 100 jin of millet per month. The tools and furniture needed for processing are temporarily borrowed from the shareholders' homes and will be returned at a price after the business develops, which reduces many expenses at the start-up. The joint factory has adopted a small-profit policy, with the general processing fee for a sheepskin being three and a half jin of millet, but they only charge three jin. The current problems of the factory are: First, insufficient funds. Its turnover is disproportionate to its working capital. Only 10% of the hide processing fee is paid in advance, which is not enough for turnover. They want to apply for a loan from the National Bank. If they can actively find ways to raise funds on their own, expanding operations on the one hand, and borrow some money from the National Bank on the other, it is certainly possible. Second, in terms of management, there is still a phenomenon of setting up positions based on individuals. For example, there is one person for finance and one for accounting, but in reality, it is the same thing, and one person is enough. There are other similar phenomena that need to be improved.

　　荣兴泰等十四家羊皮作坊
    组成新华皮毛联营工
    采取薄利方针接受大批加工生意
    【本报讯】京市荣泰兴、长生远等十四家羊皮作坊组成新华皮毛第一联营工厂，自六月四日正式开工后，已接受了华北军区后勤军需处张垣办事处与第一皮革工厂两批加工活，共各种皮三万二千余张，加工费达三万余斤小米（能看一成到二成利润）。该十四家作坊在未联营之前，每家都是掌柜的带着一、二个小徒弟操作。人力单薄，资金短少，不能包作大批活计，去年营业都不好。联营之后，人力、资金集中，较分散经营已有好转。参加联营的各厂股东，都参加了管理或生产。为了照顾股东家庭困难，每人每月可暂支小米一百斤。加工所需工具、家具，都是由股东家中暂借，待营业开展后，即作价归还，这样减少了开工时的许多开支。该联营工厂采取了薄利方针，羊皮一张一般加工费是三斤半小米，他们只取三斤。该厂目前存在的问题是：一、资金不足。其营业额与流动资金很不相称。皮张加工费只先付一成，不够周转。他们想向国家银行申请贷款。如果他们能在自力更生的基础上，一方面股东自己积极设法筹划资金，扩大经营；另一方面向国家银行贷一些款，当然是可以的。二、在管理方面，尚有因人设事的现象。如财务与会计各设一人，实际上是一回事，用一人就够了。其他还有相似的现象，均须加以改进。      （艾石）
