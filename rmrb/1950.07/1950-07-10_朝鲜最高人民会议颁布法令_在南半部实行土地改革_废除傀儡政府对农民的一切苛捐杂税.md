Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 9th: The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decree on the 4th regarding the implementation of land reform in the southern half of the Republic. The decree declares: In order to grant freedom and happiness to the peasants in the southern half of the Republic, who have been liberated from the sinister rule of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and to rapidly develop the backward rural economy, land reform will be implemented in the southern half in accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution of the Republic. The land reform will be based on the principle of uncompensated confiscation and uncompensated distribution.

The decree also stipulates that all kinds of exploitative taxes and levies imposed on peasants by the Syngman Rhee puppet government shall be abolished. Peasants in the southern half will only pay the same percentage of tax in kind to the state as peasants in the northern half. In order to rapidly improve the impoverished lives of peasants in the southern half, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly authorizes the Cabinet to significantly reduce the tax in kind amount for the region in 1950.

The decree clearly stipulates that peasants are free to dispose of agricultural products remaining after paying the tax in kind, and the "contribution system" that plunged peasants into starvation is abolished. The Cabinet shall especially protect the interests of working peasants and assist them with various methods permitted by economic policy.

This decree also defines the organization and steps for implementing land reform and instructs the Cabinet to formulate detailed rules for implementing this decree.

　　朝鲜最高人民会议颁布法令
    在南半部实行土地改革
    废除傀儡政府对农民的一切苛捐杂税
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会于四日发布关于在共和国南半部实施土地改革的法令。法令宣称：为了给予从美帝国主义者和李承晚傀儡政府的罪恶统治下解放出来的共和国南半部农民以自由和幸福，以使落后的农村经济迅速发展，根据共和国宪法第七条，在南半部实行土地改革。土地改革以无偿没收和无偿分配为原则。
    法令并规定，废除李承晚傀儡政府对农民所征收的各种苛捐杂税。南半部的农民只缴纳与北半部农民同样比率的实物税给国家。而为了急速改善凋敝的南半部农民生活，最高人民会议常任委员会授权部长会议对该区一九五○年的实物税税额予以显著的减轻。
    法令明确规定：农民于缴纳实物税后剩余的农产品由农民自由处理，废除使农民陷于饥饿的“供出制度”；部长会议应特别保护劳动农民的利益，并以经济政策所允许的各种方法帮助他们。
    这个法令也确定了实施土地改革的组织和步骤，并责成部长会议制订实施这个法令的施行细则。
