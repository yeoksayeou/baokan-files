    Emancipated Peasants Live a Happy Life, Production is Constantly Improving

    [By Our Own Correspondent] According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: In the two years since the land reform was completed in Xinglonggou Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, the peasants' main demands—land and draught animals—have been met, and clothing and housing have also been greatly improved.

    After the peasants in the village were allocated land, their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Under the leadership of Communist Party members, they actively organized themselves for production. By now, the cultivated land area of the village has increased by 10% compared to before the land reform, and farming methods have also been improved, resulting in continuous improvement in production. Last year, the average harvest per hectare in the village increased by 25% compared to before the land reform. As a result, the lives of the peasants in the village have improved rapidly. Before the land reform, every summer, the peasants of Xinglonggou Village faced the threat of running out of food; but now they can often eat yellow millet, eggs, and tofu. These foods were difficult for them to enjoy even during the New Year holidays in the past. Li Junfa, a peasant in the village, was a poor peasant before the land reform. Every summer, he barely survived on thin porridge by begging from east to west. Now his family eats dry rice every meal. There is no summer famine in the whole village, and it is estimated that there are more than 300 shi of surplus grain. Moreover, they also have a lot of sideline income. This year, they have earned more than 200 million Northeast currency from transportation alone.

    The peasants of Xinglonggou Village are now all dressed in simple new clothes. Bare-armed farmers and naked children are now just memories for them. Village Chief Shao Hongwu used to be a well-known "cold weather bachelor" who was poorly clothed all year round. This year, his family of eight has all made a brand-new set of single clothes. Since last autumn, the peasants in the village have used an average of more than fifteen chi of cloth per person. The markets are filled with all kinds of white cloth and floral cloth every time, and they are quickly snapped up by the peasants.

    The peasants in the village no longer live in leaky thatched huts, but in blue-stone tiled houses with bright windows and doors. Zhu Jiqing, Yang Junting, Yang Junyi, and other bachelors in the village all got married last year. Among the 139 households in the village, there are now more than 150 fat cattle and horses being raised.

    The cultural demands of the peasants in the village are also increasing year by year. A primary school has recently been established in the village. More than 90% of the 87 students are children of former poor peasants and cowherds. Most of the middle-aged people, who have been swallowed up by the hard days for half their lives, do not even know their own names, and now they are also participating in literacy classes. Last winter, more than 60 peasants participated in winter school. Old farmer Yao Wen learned more than 200 characters in one winter. Some young peasants can now read newspapers, keep accounts, issue receipts, and write letters. Even in these days when the days are long and the nights are short, and they are busy hoeing the fields during the day, there are still people working hard to study under the lamplight at night.

　　吉林舒兰县兴隆沟屯
    翻身农民生活美满  生产量正不断提高
    【本报讯】据新华社沈阳电：吉林省舒兰县兴隆沟屯自该地完成土地改革到现在的两年多的时间内，农民的主要要求——土地、耕畜，都已经获得满足，衣服、房子也大大改善了。
    该屯农民在分到土地以后，生产情绪大为提高；他们在共产党员领导下，纷纷组织起来进行生产。到现在，全屯耕地面积比土地改革前增加了百分之十，耕作方法也改进了，因而生产量不断提高。去年该屯每垧地的收获量平均比土地改革前增加了百分之二十五。这样，该屯农民生活也就迅速获得改善。土地改革以前，每年夏季，兴隆沟屯的农民们就面临着断炊的威胁；但是现在他们已能经常地吃到黄米、鸡蛋和豆腐了。这些食品，在以前他们在过年过节时也是很难享受的。该屯农民李俊发，土地改革前是贫农，每年在夏天就靠着东乞西借，勉强喝一顿稀粥度日。现在他家顿顿是干饭了。全屯没有夏荒，估计还有余粮三百多石。而且他们还有很多副业收益，今年他们从运输一项中就收入了东北币二亿多元。
    兴隆沟屯的农民们现在都已穿上朴素的新装。光着臂膀的庄稼汉，赤条条的孩子，现在只是他们回忆中的事了。屯长邵洪武过去是有名的“冷天光棍”，整年衣不蔽体。今年他一家八口全做了一套崭新的单衣。从去年秋天到现在，全屯农民平均每人用布在十五尺以上。每次集上都摆满了各式各样的白布和花布，每次都很快地被农民们抢购一空。
    该屯农民们住的也不再是漏顶破屋，而是有着明窗亮户的青石瓦房了。屯中独身汉朱吉庆、杨均庭、杨均一等都在去年结了婚。全屯一百三十九户中，现在饲养着一百五十多头肥壮的牛马。
    该屯农民的文化要求也一年比一年提高。屯中新近办了一所小学，八十七名学生中，百分之九十以上都是过去贫苦农民的子弟和牧童。半辈子已被苦难的日子吞蚀了的中年人，多半连自己的名字也不认识，现在也都参加识字班了。去年冬学，有六十多个农民参加学习，老农姚文有一冬就认会了二百多个字，有些青年农民现在已能看报、记账、开条子和写信了。该屯就在这日长夜短、白天忙着锄地的日子里，还有人在夜晚灯光下，努力学习。
