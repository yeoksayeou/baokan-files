After two rainfalls in most parts of the province on June 17th and 22nd, the sowing campaign quickly unfolded in various locations. Farmers in Mengyin County planted over 80,000 mu of corn and beans in four days, and replanted some peanuts and millet. For example, Shangdu District of the county replanted over 3,000 mu of peanuts.

In some drought-affected areas, farmers are also continuing drought resistance efforts during summer planting. Farmers in Fei County have dug over 1,300 new wells and repaired over 300 old wells, planting 24,000 mu of sweet potatoes and peanuts. At the same time, the people's governments at all levels in the province have promptly distributed nearly 8,000 new-style waterwheels to actively assist farmers in drought resistance. Farmers in Xiao Haojia Village, Ji Mountain District, Zhaoyuan County, used the 14 newly loaned waterwheels to draw water for replanting, and the entire district planted a total of over 8,700 mu of land, including the use of wells. In addition, the leading organs of Shi Shao County also dispatched cadres to organize work teams to go deep into various districts and villages during the summer planting season to specifically lead farmers in carrying out drought resistance work.
