Water Levels of Major Rivers Across the Country Mostly Rising
	Flood Prevention in Various Regions Enters Tense Stage
	Various Localities Conduct Thorough Inspections of Dikes and Strengthen Dike Protection and Emergency Rescue
	[This Newspaper reports] Flood prevention work along the major rivers of the country has begun to enter a tense stage. Since late June, there has been widespread rainfall in various regions, and the water levels of major rivers have mostly risen, with some areas experiencing breaches and resulting in disasters.
	In the Pearl River basin, the first flood arrived as early as late June. Gaoyao station exceeded the danger level by 0.22 meters on June 25th; Qingyuan exceeded the danger level by 1.73 meters on the same day. Currently, the water levels at each station have dropped below the danger level, and the first flood has passed.
	In the Yangtze River basin, the water level at Chongqing station rose to 179.86 meters on July 9th, only 0.14 meters below the danger level, an average increase of 13 meters compared to the second half of June. The water level at Yichang exceeded the danger level by 2.18 meters on July 11th. The flood peak has passed Jianli on the 14th; on the 15th, the water level at Shashi rose to 42.90 meters, exceeding the danger level by 0.60 meters. Downstream water levels are also expected to rise. Other places, such as Jiujiang and Taoyuan (in the Yuan River basin of Hunan), also experienced a sudden rise on July 10th.
	The Yellow River basin has also experienced slight fluctuations, but all remain below the danger level.
	In the Huai River basin, there have been widespread heavy rains since late June, causing the Huai River water level to rise continuously. By July 17th, it had risen to 24.46 meters, exceeding the height of the dikes. According to rainfall estimates upstream, it is expected to continue to rise.
	In North China, the Yongding River stations began reporting flood conditions early since late June. There was a rise in water level on June 30th, with the flow rate at Guanting reaching 1,100 cubic meters per second. Emergency measures were taken at Lugou Bridge on July 1st. Since mid-July, the water level has been trending upwards again.
	In Northeast China, the rivers entered the flood season on July 10th and have also gradually been rising.
	Due to the continuous rise in water levels in various regions, river water has already caused flooding in some areas. For example, in the Fuyang, Suxian, and Chuxian special districts of northern Anhui Province, over ten million mu of land have been inundated. In the Pujiang River and Cao'e River areas of Zhejiang Province, 443,307 mu of land have been affected. The Anlang Highway on the north bank of the Yongding River has been washed away, and over 20,000 mu of cultivated land have been flooded.
	In response to the above situation, the flood prevention headquarters in various regions have successively issued urgent instructions, requiring a firm grasp of water condition changes, thorough inspections of dikes, and the avoidance of complacency and negligence to prevent unexpected disasters. Currently, all regions attach great importance to flood prevention work. For example, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, personally inspected the rivers and dispatched inspection teams to conduct thorough inspections of the Daqing and Ziya rivers. The Cangxian Special District also formed 27 inspection teams to inspect the dikes; some counties have conducted secondary inspections. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial People's Government accepted the experience from the initial rise in water level of the Yongding River and established a joint office system for the flood prevention organizations of the Tong, Jin, and Bao special districts, with personnel from the provincial government participating. Straw materials have now been placed on the dikes of various rivers in Hebei.
	After the establishment of flood prevention headquarters in provinces and counties along the Songhua River and Liao River systems in Northeast China, a general inspection of river dikes was carried out. Preliminary inspections have already identified 257 dangerous works. In the Chaohu Special District of northern Anhui, 29 dangerous sections and numerous cracks have also been found on the river dikes of He County, Wuwei County, and Jingjiang County along the Yangtze River. All areas have been repaired to eliminate hidden dangers in the dikes.
	In some areas of Zhejiang, due to drought and lack of rain in mid-June, most cadres led the masses to fight the drought, breaching dikes to irrigate fields, and neglecting flood prevention work. When the floods arrived, they were caught off guard, resulting in the loss of over 440,000 mu of farmland. The local leading organs have now accepted this lesson. On the one hand, they are vigorously carrying out rescue efforts to minimize the disaster, and on the other hand, they are organizing manpower to prepare materials and strengthen defenses. Not only have special and county-level flood prevention headquarters been established in various areas along the rivers, but attention has also been paid to strengthening the organization of emergency rescue teams and patrol teams.
	Flood prevention has now entered a tense stage. All regions should continue to heighten vigilance, strengthen inspections and protection, in order to overcome the floods.

　　全国主要河流水位多呈上涨
    各地防汛进入紧张阶段 
    各地深入检查堤防加强护堤抢险
    【本报讯】全国各主要河流沿岸，防汛工作已开始进入紧张阶段。自六月下旬以来，各地普遍降雨，各大江河水位多呈上涨，并有部分地区漫决成灾。
    珠江流域，早在六月下旬即有第一次洪水到来。高要站于六月二十五日曾超过危险水位○·二二公尺；清远于同日超过危险水位一·七三公尺。现在各站水位已降至危险水位之下，第一次洪水已经过去。
    长江流域重庆站，七月九日水位曾涨至一七九·八六公尺，距危险水位仅低○·一四公尺，较六月下半月平均涨高一三公尺。宜昌水位在七月十一日超过危险水位二·一八公尺。十四日洪峰已过监利；十五日沙市水位涨到四二·九○公尺，超过危险水位○·六○公尺。下游水位也将要上涨。其他如九江、桃源（湖南沅江流域）等地，也曾在七月十日一度猛涨。
    黄河流域也略有涨落，但均在危险水位以下。
    淮河流域自六月下旬以来，普降大雨，因之淮河水位连续上升，到七月十七日已涨至二四·四六公尺，已经超过堤顶高度；并且根据上游雨量估计，还将继续上涨。
    华北永定河各站自六月下旬起，提前报汛，六月三十日曾一度涨水，官厅流量达一千一百秒立公方，芦沟桥七月一日曾一度抢险；中旬以来又趋上涨。
    东北各河于七月十日进入汛期，也都渐次上涨。
    由于各地水位不断上涨，少部地区河水已经泛滥成灾。如皖北行政区阜阳、宿县、滁县三个专区，有千余万亩土地被淹；浙江省的浦阳江、曹娥江等地区，被灾土地有四十四万三千三百零七亩；永定河北岸安廊公路被冲毁，并且淹没耕地两万多亩。
    针对上述情况，各地防汛总指挥部，均已先后发出紧急指示，要求确实掌握水情变化，深入检查堤防，力戒麻痹大意，以免招致意外灾害。目前各地对防汛工作都很重视。如河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席亲赴各河视察，并派出检查组，分赴大清、子牙两河进行深入检查。沧县专区也组成了二十七个检查队进行堤防检查；有的县已进行了二次检查。同时，河北省人民政府接受了永定河初次涨水时的经验，建立了通、津、保三个专区防汛组织的联合办公制度，省府并派人参加。现在河北各河秸料都已上堤。
    东北沿松花江、辽河两水系各省、县防汛指挥部成立后，即普遍进行了河堤大检查，初步检查中已发现险工二百五十七处。皖北巢湖专区沿江的和县、无为、靖江等县江堤，也发现险工地段二十九处，裂缝多处。各地都已加以修整，消除了堤防隐患。
    浙江部分地区，在六月中旬由于天旱不雨，大部干部领导群众抗旱，扒堤灌田，放松了防汛工作，及至洪水到来，猝不及防，造成四十四万余亩田地被灾的损失。现在当地领导机关已接受了这个教训，一方面大力抢救，缩小灾情，一方面组织人力准备物料，加强防守。沿江、河各地不仅建立了专，县防汛指挥部，并注意加强了抢险队，巡防队的组织。
    目前防汛已进入紧张阶段。各地应继续提高警惕，加强检查与防护，以求战胜洪水。
