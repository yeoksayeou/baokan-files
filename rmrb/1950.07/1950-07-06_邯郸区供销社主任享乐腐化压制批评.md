To the Editor:

Yang Ruiqi, director of the Handan Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei, is extremely hedonistic and corrupt. When lower-level cadres offer him opinions, he not only fails to humbly accept them but also retaliates against them. The county-level cooperative has been aware of his mistakes but has failed to educate and criticize him, preventing the problem from being resolved promptly.

During this year's Spring Festival, the district government confiscated a mahjong set during an anti-gambling campaign. Yang Ruiqi borrowed the set from the district office to play, and later he and several others started gambling using cigarettes as stakes. They sometimes played all day and night, neglecting their work. When district leaders offered him opinions, he would shut himself up and gamble. While comrades in the cooperative were going to the countryside to establish village cooperatives, Yang Ruiqi took his wife out to see a show. He put Liu Yongzhi, who had been consistently involved in speculative trading in the past, in charge of the cooperative and the shop. The accountant, Hao Bangyan, was already careless, and Yang Ruiqi paid no attention to the matter, leading to chaotic accounting within the cooperative.

After discovering this situation, comrades Yang Zhaojing, Wang Mingde, and Li Xingde (all Communist Party members) offered Yang Ruiqi their opinions. However, Yang Ruiqi did not accept them. Comrade Li Xingde reported the matter to the county-level cooperative. Yang Ruiqi believed that Comrade Li Xingde had reported him to a higher level, and had a big quarrel with Li Xingde; he harbored resentment in his heart. The county-level cooperative did not handle the matter appropriately, leaving comrades like Li Xingde and Yang Zhaolin feeling discouraged. Comrade Yang Zhaolin requested to return home, citing his wife's illness and the lack of labor for his land. Yang Ruiqi seized this opportunity to report to the county-level cooperative, emphasizing the family difficulties of Comrade Yang Zhaolin and claiming that Comrade Yang Zhaolin lacked work ability. The county-level cooperative did not conduct a thorough investigation and allowed Comrade Yang Zhaolin to return home. Comrade Wu Xiushen, the director of the county-level cooperative, had originally intended to ask Comrade Yang Zhaolin to talk to him at the county-level cooperative before returning home. Yang Ruiqi, fearing that Comrade Yang Zhaolin would report his situation, stopped him. In addition, because Comrade Li Xingde had previously reported the situation to the county-level cooperative, Yang Ruiqi reported to the county-level cooperative that he was not actively working, lacked ability, and had family problems, and wanted to "purge" him home. Comrade Wang Mingde, seeing this situation, also requested to return home.

Based on these circumstances, I suggest that the county-level cooperative should improve its leadership, promptly handle this matter, urge Yang Ruiqi to conduct a deep self-criticism, and give him appropriate punishment. The county-level cooperative should commend the comrades in the cooperative who are actively responsible and boldly offer opinions. It should also persuade Comrade Yang Zhaolin to resume his work.

### 邯郸区供销社主任享乐腐化压制批评

　　邯郸区供销社主任享乐腐化压制批评编辑同志：
    河北邯郸四区供销社主任杨瑞岐，享乐腐化行为极其严重。下级干部给他提意见，他不但不虚心接受，反加以打击。该县县联社，虽已知道了他的错误，却不加以教育、批评，致使问题没有及早解决。
    今年春节，该区区政府在禁赌时没收了一副麻将牌。杨瑞岐就从区公所把那副牌借来玩，后来就和几个人一起拿烟卷当赌注实行赌博。有时成天成夜的打，不顾业务。区领导同志向他提出意见，他就关起门来赌。当社内同志们正在下乡建立村合作社的时候，杨瑞岐却带着老婆到外面去看戏。他把社里以及门市的工作交给一个过去一贯做投机买卖的刘永志去管。会计郝邦颜本来很马虎，杨瑞岐又是不闻不问，于是便造成社内账目混乱的现象。
    该社杨兆井、王明德、李兴德三同志（都是中共党员）发现此种情况后，就给杨瑞岐提出意见。但杨瑞岐并不接受。李兴德同志就把这事报告县联社。杨瑞岐认为李兴德同志到上级告他，和李兴德同志大闹一场；并怀恨在心。县联社对这事也没作适当的处理，使李兴德、杨兆林等同志都很灰心。杨兆林同志就借家中老婆有病、土地没人耕种，要求回家。杨瑞岐趁此机会向县联社汇报，强调杨兆林同志的家庭困难，还说杨兆林同志工作没能力。县联社也没有很好调查，就让杨兆林同志回了家。县联社主任吴修身同志本来准备叫杨兆林同志到县联社谈谈再回家。杨瑞岐怕杨兆林同志反映了他的情况，就阻住了。此外，杨瑞岐又因李兴德同志曾向县联社反映情况，就向县联社汇报，说他工作不积极，没能力，有家庭问题，要把他“清洗”回家。王明德同志看到此种情况，也要求回家。
    根据这些情况，我建议该县联社应该改进领导，迅速处理这件事，督促杨瑞岐进行深刻检讨，并给以适当处分。对该社积极负责，大胆提意见的同志，县联社应给以表扬。并说服杨兆林同志恢复工作。
    高永
