　　　The Mutual Aid Group of the First District Workers' Spare-time School Promotes Learning
　　Since its rectification this spring, the First Workers' Spare-time School in the First District has established mutual aid groups based on the work units and residential locations of the students, and has formulated learning covenants. Under the leadership of the school committee and class leaders, the groups have gradually become sound. They often use the half hour before class to chat about unclear issues in learning and various issues related to teaching. This not only promotes the spirit of mutual learning assistance, but also enables the school to improve its work in a timely manner based on the students' requirements. Criticism and self-criticism have gradually been carried out within the groups, with mutual supervision and encouragement, and joint efforts to progress. (Li Jinghua)

　　　Beijing Municipality Increases Chlorine Dosage in Tap Water
　　In order to enhance the disinfection power of tap water and ensure the cleanliness of water quality, the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau and the Waterworks Company have increased the "chlorine dosage" by one-third since June 30th, so that the city's tap water can always maintain a certain "residual chlorine," which has sufficient bactericidal effect and can reduce the transmission of gastrointestinal diseases. The Public Health Bureau and the Waterworks Company have also decided to check the water in various places daily for "residual chlorine." After the increase in "chlorine dosage," the odor in the water will be slightly increased, but it is absolutely beneficial and harmless to health.

        一区工人补习学校互助组推动学习
    一区第一工人补习学校自今春整顿后，根据学员工作单位及住址地段建立了互助小组，并订出学习公约。各小组在校委会和班长领导下逐渐健全起来。他们经常利用上课前半小时，对学习中尚不清楚的问题，及有关教学方面的各种问题，进行漫谈，这样一方面可以发挥学习互助的精神，又可以使校方根据学员要求及时改进工作。小组内又逐渐开展了批评与自我批评，互相督促和鼓励，共求进步。    （李京华）
            京市自来水提高加氯量
    京市公共卫生局和自来水公司为增强自来水的消毒力量，保证水质清洁，已自六月三十日起提高了“加氯量”三分之一，使全市的自来水都能经常保持一定的“剩余氯”，有充分杀菌作用，可以减少肠胃病的传染。公共卫生局和自来水公司并决定每天检查各处水中有无“剩余氯”，“加氯量”提高后，水中气味稍多，但对身体健康绝对有利无害。
