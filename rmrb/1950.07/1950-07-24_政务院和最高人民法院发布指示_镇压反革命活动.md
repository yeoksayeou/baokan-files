Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The Government Administration Council Premier Zhou Enlai and Supreme People's Court President Shen Junru jointly issued directives on the 23rd regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities. These directives have been approved by the Chairman of the Central People's Government. The full text is as follows:

Government Administration Council and Supreme People's Court Directives Regarding the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Activities

The Chinese People's Liberation War has basically ended on the mainland, and local people's governments at all levels have been established successively. However, in some regions, especially in some newly liberated areas, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the instigation of imperialism, are still adopting methods such as armed rebellion and covert sabotage, organizing secret agents and bandits, colluding with local tyrants and evil gentry, or inciting some backward elements to continuously engage in anti-government and various counter-revolutionary activities in order to undermine social order and endanger the interests of the people and the state. Therefore, actively leading the people to resolutely eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and rapidly establish and consolidate revolutionary order, in order to safeguard the people's democratic rights and smoothly carry out production and construction and various necessary social reforms, has become one of the important tasks of the people's governments at all levels.

The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates in Article 7: "The People's Republic of China must suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause. For ordinary reactionaries, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists, after disarming them and eliminating their special influence, they must still be deprived of their political rights for a necessary period in accordance with the law, but at the same time given a way out for their livelihood, and forced to transform themselves through labor to become new people. If they continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely sanctioned." People's governments at all levels must, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, adopt severe and timely suppression of all counter-revolutionary activities, and in implementing suppression and handling all counter-revolutionary cases, they must also implement the policy of combining suppression with leniency, that is, the ringleaders must be dealt with severely, those who are coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. This policy must not be neglected, in order to unite the people, isolate the counter-revolutionary elements, and achieve the goal of gradually eliminating counter-revolutionary elements. To this end, the following principled instructions regarding the handling of important counter-revolutionary elements are hereby presented to the Chairman of the Central People's Government for approval:

One, all bandits who hold weapons and gather to rebel must be resolutely suppressed and annihilated, and their masterminds, commanders, and those with serious crimes shall be sentenced to death in accordance with the law.

Two, all activities, organizations, or espionage and assassination agencies that kill public officials and people for counter-revolutionary purposes, destroy factories, mines, warehouses, transportation, and other public property, rob the state and people's materials, steal state secrets, and incite backward elements to oppose the people's government, should be thoroughly uncovered and their organizers and those with serious crimes arrested and sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment in accordance with the law.

Three, incorrigible bandit-secret agents and habitual bandits shall be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or death in accordance with the law.

Four, those who collude with or harbor the above three categories of important counter-revolutionary elements and whose circumstances are serious shall be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or death in accordance with the law.

All the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary cases, after being sentenced to death by the local people's court or people's tribunal, the approval procedures, in the newly liberated areas, shall be approved by the chairman of the provincial people's government or the chief of the local special commissioner's office or above authorized by the provincial people's government, and then executed. In the old liberated areas of Northeast, North China, and Northwest, they shall be approved by the chairman of the provincial people's government or the chairman of the greater administrative region people's government and then executed. In the municipalities directly under the central government and the greater administrative regions, they shall be approved by the president of the Supreme People's Court and the chairman of the greater administrative region people's government (military and political committee) respectively, and then executed. Those sentenced to death for the above-mentioned important counter-revolutionary elements shall not be allowed to appeal.

The handling of all the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary criminals shall be based on thorough investigation of evidence, careful study of the case, and prohibition of obtaining confessions by torture. In implementing the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, indiscriminate arrests and killings should be prevented. If such situations occur, they should be promptly and effectively stopped, and the responsibility investigated and dealt with according to law.

In areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated or mixed communities, the handling of ethnic conflicts provoked by counter-revolutionary elements should be carefully decided according to the specific circumstances, and timely instructions should be requested from the higher-level people's government for approval.

    镇压反革命活动
    【新华社二十三日讯】政务院周恩来总理，最高人民法院沈钧儒院长于二十三日会衔发布关于镇压反革命活动的指示。此指示业经中央人民政府主席批准。其全文如下：
    政务院最高人民法院关于镇压反革命活动的指示
    中国人民解放战争已在大陆上基本结束，各级地方人民政府已先后成立。但在某些地区特别是有些新解放地区，国民党反动派残余在帝国主义指使之下，仍在采取武装暴乱和潜伏暗害等活动方式，组织特务土匪，勾结地主恶霸，或煽动一部分落后分子，不断地从事反对人民政府及各种反革命活动，以破坏社会治安，危害人民与国家利益。因此，积极领导人民坚决地肃清一切公开的与暗藏的反革命分子，迅速地建立与巩固革命秩序，以保障人民民主权利并顺利地进行生产建设及各项必要的社会改革，成为各级人民政府当前重要任务之一。
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条规定：“中华人民共和国必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。对于一般的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利，但同时给以生活出路，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁”。各级人民政府必须遵照共同纲领的规定，对一切反革命活动采取严厉的及时的镇压，而在实行镇压和处理一切反革命案件中，又必须贯彻实行镇压与宽大相结合的政策，即首恶者必办、胁从者不问、立功者受奖的政策，不可偏废，以期团结人民、孤立反革命分子而达到逐步肃清反革命分子的目的。为此，特对重要反革命分子的处理，呈经中央人民政府主席批准作如下的原则指示：
    一、对一切手持武器、聚众叛乱的匪众，必须坚决镇压剿灭，并将其主谋者、指挥者及罪恶重大者，依法处以死刑。
    二、对以反革命为目的而杀害公职人员和人民、破坏工矿仓库交通及其他公共财物、抢劫国家和人民的物资、偷窃国家机密及煽动落后分子反对人民政府的一切活动、组织或谍报、暗杀机关，应彻底破获并逮捕其组织者及罪恶重大者，依法处以死刑或长期徒刑。
    三、对怙恶不悛的匪特分子和惯匪，依法处以长期徒刑或死刑。
    四、凡勾结、窝藏上述三项重要反革命分子而情节重大者，依法处以长期徒刑或死刑。
    所有上述各项反革命案件，经当地人民法院或人民法庭判决死刑者，其批准手续，在新解放地区，由省人民政府主席或省人民政府授权之当地专署以上首长批准后执行，在东北、华北及西北老解放地区，由省人民政府或大行政区人民政府主席批准后执行，在中央及大行政区直属市，分别由最高人民法院院长及大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）主席批准后执行。上述各项重要反革命分子之判决死刑者均不得上诉。
    所有上述各项反革命案犯的处理，均应切实调查证据，认真研究案情，并禁止刑讯逼供。在实行镇压反革命活动中，应防止乱打乱杀，如发生此种情形时，应予迅速有效制止，并查究责任，依法处理。
    各少数民族聚居或杂居地区，关于反革命分子挑拨的民族冲突事件的处理，应按具体情况妥慎决定，并及时请示上级人民政府批准。
                                    政务院  总理  周恩来
                                    最高人民法院院长  沈钧儒
