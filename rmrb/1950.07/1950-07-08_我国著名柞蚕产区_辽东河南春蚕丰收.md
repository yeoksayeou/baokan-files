Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: China's two famous wild silkworm producing areas, Liaodong and Henan provinces (another wild silkworm producing area in China is the Jiaodong area under Shandong Province), have both reported bumper spring silkworm harvests this spring.

This spring, with the help of government loans, most silkworm farms in Liaodong Province have been restored. This spring, silkworm farmers across the province raised silkworms on a total of 80 million trees, an increase of nearly one-half compared to last year. Silkworm farmers in various parts of the province have now begun picking cocoons. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the province can harvest more than 600 million good cocoons, an increase of about 50% compared to the normal output. The Provincial People's Government has now begun to help silkworm farmers prepare autumn silkworm seeds and silkworm farms, and has decided that the Liaodong Provincial Branch of the Northeast Bank will issue an additional 8 billion Northeast currency in autumn silkworm loans to silkworm farmers. It is expected that 400 million trees can be used to raise silkworms this autumn, and more than 3 billion autumn silkworm cocoons can be harvested, which is enough to guarantee the supply of raw materials for the entire Northeast silk weaving industry.

This spring, Henan Province harvested a total of more than 170 million spring cocoons, which can be reeled into more than 1,500 dan (a unit of weight) of silk, an increase of more than three times compared to previous years. The wild silkworm producing area in Henan is distributed in 15 counties including Lushan, Nanzhao, Nanyang, Fangcheng, and Zhenping, with about 500,000 silkworm farmers. In order to help silkworm farmers sell their products, the Nanyang Special District prepaid for silkworm silk with 300,000 jin of grain this spring. State-owned trading companies in various places have now begun to purchase mountain silk. Among them, the Lushan Trading Company has purchased more than 12,000 square feet of mountain silk. Therefore, the silkworm silk market in various parts of Henan is becoming increasingly active, and silkworm farmers are extremely happy and their interest in silkworm breeding has doubled. At present, silkworm farmers in Lushan have raised more than 15,000 baskets of autumn silkworms, and silkworm farmers in other places are also actively preparing to raise autumn silkworms.

　　我国著名柞蚕产区
    辽东河南春蚕丰收
    【新华社五日讯】我国著名两大柞蚕产区辽东、河南两省（中国还有一个柞蚕产区是山东省所属的胶东区）今春柞蚕皆告丰收。
    辽东省蚕场今春在人民政府贷款扶助下，大部业已恢复，全省蚕农今春共放蚕八千万棵树，较去年增加了将近二分之一。现该省各地蚕农已开始摘茧。据目前情况估计，全省共可收好茧约六亿粒以上，较常年产量约提高百分之五十。现该省人民政府又已开始帮助蚕农准备秋蚕种和蚕场，并决定由东北银行辽东省行增发秋蚕贷款东北币八十余亿元，贷放给蚕农；预计今秋可放蚕四亿棵树，可收秋蚕茧三十亿粒以上，足以保证供应东北丝织工业原料的全部需要。
    河南省今春共收春茧一亿七千余万粒，可缫丝一千五百余市担，较往年产量增加三倍以上。河南柞蚕产区分布于鲁山、南召、南阳、方城、镇平等十五县，养蚕农民约五十万人。为帮助蚕农推销产品，南阳专区于今春即以三十万斤粮食预购蚕丝。各地国营贸易公司现已开始收购山绸，其中鲁山贸易公司已收购山绸达一万二千余方尺。因此，河南各地蚕丝市场日趋活跃，蚕农欣喜异常，对于育蚕的兴趣倍增。现在鲁山蚕农饲养秋蚕已有一万五千余筐，其他各地蚕农也正积极准备饲育秋蚕。
