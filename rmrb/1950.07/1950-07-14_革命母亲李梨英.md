　　Revolutionary Mother Li Liying
    Yi Yue
    Comrade Li Liying, a representative from the Chao-Shan region attending the Guangdong Provincial Women's Congress, is 64 years old this year. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, she has been engaged in long-term and arduous struggles in Chao-Shan for more than 20 years. As early as the Great Revolution era, she participated in the vigorous peasant movement in the Chao-Shan area. After the failure of the Great Revolution, under the rule of white terror, she persisted in underground work in her hometown - Xikeng Village, Chao'an.
    In 1932, during the period when the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in the Chao-Shan area mobilized peasants, organized guerrilla groups, and established Soviet power in the countryside, she encouraged her three older sons and one son-in-law to go to Phoenix Mountain to join the guerrilla war. She herself, with her youngest son Yu Sen (12 years old), stayed in her hometown to persist in revolutionary work, responsible for scouting enemy situations and transmitting information to the Red Army guerrillas. When the enemy launched an encirclement and suppression campaign against Dakeng Village, she resolutely left the citrus orchard that she had personally cultivated, and followed her team into Phoenix Mountain to fight guerrilla warfare with her youngest son.
    During this period, the Chinese revolution suffered extreme difficulties. Her three sons and one son-in-law all gloriously sacrificed themselves for the people's revolutionary cause. Soon, she followed the team to Wushi Mountain (also known as Diandeng Mountain) in Fujian, and operated in the mountainous areas bordering Pinghe, Zhangpu, Yunxiao, and Zhao'an in southern Fujian. Although she was over forty years old at this time, she still worked tirelessly. At this time, she was in charge of the rear hospital. Chopping wood, cooking, washing clothes, and nursing the wounded often kept her busy until late at night. Once, after a fierce battle, sixty or seventy wounded comrades were carried down. She washed all the bloody clothes by herself, cleaned up a charcoal kiln to accommodate the wounded comrades, and personally took care of them and applied medicine. Under her careful care, many comrades quickly returned to the team. In this way, her name spread throughout every team and throughout the entire mountainous area. Everyone affectionately called her "Aunt."
    On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang bandits more frantically attacked the people's armed forces. The revolutionary base areas in southern Fujian entered the most difficult stage. At this time, Comrade Li Liying was responsible for the rear work of the base area, organizing intelligence stations, managing training classes and hospitals. She worked day and night, drilling in mountain caves, living in mountain nests, crossing mountains and ridges in the dark, escorting wounded and sick comrades to safe areas. She often carried seriously wounded comrades on her back, while trying to wipe the blood stains on the ground to avoid the enemy tracking them. For the sake of the comrades' safety, she disregarded her own life, endured hunger and cold, and ventured deep into enemy-occupied cities to work, trying to bring back many medicines and other items to solve the medical difficulties.
    In 1937, the Anti-Japanese War began. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army guerrillas active in the South were reorganized into the New Fourth Army; this revolutionary force that had persisted in the struggle in southern Fujian for a long time was also preparing for reorganization. However, the Kuomintang bandit army, using shameful means, tricked the team to near Zhangpu County, forced the entire team to surrender their weapons, and carried out a "search and suppression" of the base area, attempting to use this perfidious behavior to eliminate the revolutionary people's armed forces. At this time, Comrade Li Liying organized more than twenty comrades who had escaped back one after another, trying to maintain their lives, strengthen their fighting spirit, and transfer them to the Huoshaolong area to operate, until they finally established contact with the brother teams in southwestern Fujian.
    In the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, due to work needs, Comrade Li Liying left the southern Fujian base area, leading several comrades, disguised as blacksmiths, and safely arrived in the Baihou area of Dabu County through the enemy area to work. It was at this time that her last son was also captured and gloriously sacrificed in southern Fujian. When the comrades came to comfort her, she said: "Revolution is a bloody struggle, and it is glorious to sacrifice for the revolution and for the people!"
    During the eight-year Anti-Japanese War and the three-and-a-half-year War of Liberation, Comrade Li Liying always persisted in the most arduous revolutionary work. After the complete liberation of Chao-Shan, she felt indescribable joy because of the victory of the revolution. Although she was already sixty-two years old, she continued to participate in various mass movements, lead the masses to comfort the liberating army, and support the front lines, just as she did in those years. Xikeng Village struggled against the local tyrants Lin SenSong, Lin SenLin, Lin ChaoLong, Lin RuiTian, Lin HeQiang, Lin YanHua, etc. who had embezzled her and many others' property in those years, compensating her with one hundred dan of grain. She donated half to the state as public grain, and the other half to help poor peasants, while she herself still maintained that simple and hard life. After this incident was announced at the first People's Congress of Shantou City, everyone admired her.

　　革命母亲李梨英
    易越
    出席广东全省妇女代表会议的潮汕区代表李梨英同志，今年已经六十四岁了。她在中国共产党的领导下，在潮汕从事了二十多年的长期艰苦斗争。远在大革命时代，她就参加了当时潮汕一带的轰轰烈烈的农民运动。大革命失败后，在白色恐怖的统治下，她仍坚持着家乡——潮安西坑乡的地下工作。
    一九三二年，潮汕地区的工农红军在农村发动农民，组织游击小组，建立苏维埃政权时期，她鼓励三个大些的儿子和一个女婿上凤凰山去参加游击战争。自己带着最小的一个儿子于森（十二岁），留在家乡坚持革命工作，负责探听敌情，给红军游击队传递消息。等到敌人向大坑乡进行围剿时，她便带着她的小儿子，毅然离开她亲自劳动培植起来的一片柑园，随着自己的队伍进了凤凰山打游击。
    这一时期，中国革命遭受了极大的困难。她的三个儿子和一个女婿，都为人民的革命事业光荣牺牲了。不久，她随队伍转到福建的乌石山（又名点灯山），在闽南的平和、漳浦、云霄、沼安边境的山区活动。虽然她这时已经四十余岁了，但她仍不知疲劳地工作。这时，她是后方医院的主持人。砍柴、烧饭、洗衣及看护伤员等工作，时常忙到深夜。有一次，经过了剧烈的战斗之后，抬下来六、七十个受伤同志。她一个人洗了全部血衣，把一个炭窑收拾得干干净净来安置受伤同志，并亲自看护、敷药。在她的小心调治下，许多同志都很快的回到了队伍。就这样，她的名字传遍了每一个队伍，传遍了全山区。大家都亲?地叫她做“亚姆”。
    抗日战争前夜，国民党匪帮更疯狂地进攻人民武装。闽南的革命根据地走上最艰难的阶段。这时，李梨英同志负责根据地的后方工作，组织情报站，管理训练班、医院。她日以继夜地工作，钻山洞、住山窠，黑夜里翻山越岭，护送伤病的同志转移到安全地带。她常常一面背着重伤的同志，一面设法揩去地上的血迹，避免敌人追踪。为了同志们的安全，她不顾自己的生命，忍饥挨饿，冒险深入敌区城市工作，设法带回许多药物及其他东西，解决医药的困难。
    一九三七年，抗日战争开始了。活动在南方的工农红军游击队改编为新四军；长期在闽南坚持斗争的这支革命队伍，也准备进行改编。但国民党匪军，却以可耻的手段，把队伍骗到漳浦县城附近，强迫全队缴械，并向根据地进行“搜剿”，企图用这种背信弃义的行为来消灭革命的人民武装。这时李梨英同志组织了陆续逃跑回来的二十几个同志，设法维持他们的生活，坚定他们的斗志，并把他们转移到火烧龙一带活动，一直坚持到和闽西南的弟兄队伍取得联系。
    抗日战争后期，因为工作的需要，李梨英同志离开闽南根据地，带领好几个同志，装成打铁匠，通过敌区安全到达大埔县百侯一带工作。就在这个时候，她最后一个儿子，也在闽南被俘，光荣牺牲了。当同志们来安慰她的时候，她说：“革命就是一个流血斗争，为革命、为人民而牺牲是光荣的！”
    八年抗日战争和三年半的解放战争中，李梨英同志始终坚持着最艰苦的革命工作。潮汕全面解放后，她因革命的胜利而感到难以形容的欣慰。她虽然已经六十二岁，但仍和当年一样，继续参加各种群众运动，领导群众慰劳解放大军，支援前线。西坑乡斗争了当年侵吞她和许多人财产的恶霸林森松、林森林、林潮隆、林瑞添、林合强、林炎花等，赔偿她谷子一百担，她把一半献给国家作公粮，一半救济贫苦农民，而她自己却仍然保持那种朴素艰苦的生活。这一件事在汕头市第一届人民代表会议上宣布之后，大家无不钦敬。
