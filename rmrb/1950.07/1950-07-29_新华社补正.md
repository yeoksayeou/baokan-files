    In the "Summary Report on the Five Months of Work After the Establishment of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government" issued on July 26th, the phrase "Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government" should be added before the name of the reporter "Burhan." Please correct this. (This report was published on the first page of this newspaper on July 27th).
    In the news release "Communist Party Organizations at All Levels in Central and Southern China Gather to Commemorate the Party's Birthday" on July 2nd, "Gu Dacun, Second Secretary of the CCP Central China South Bureau" is a mistake and should be "Gu Dacun, Member of the CCP Central China South Bureau."
