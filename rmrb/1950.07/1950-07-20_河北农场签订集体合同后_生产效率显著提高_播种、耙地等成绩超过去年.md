　　After Signing Collective Contracts, Hebei Farm Significantly Improves Production Efficiency
　　Sowing, Harrowing, and Other Achievements Surpass Last Year
　　[This newspaper, Shijiazhuang News] The Hebei Farm in Shijiazhuang has achieved significant results in its first season of production this year, thanks to the joint efforts of the administration and workers in implementing and carrying out collective contracts.
　　The first major achievement is the improvement of leadership. Last year, the farm was unable to fully implement its work because the workers had not been widely mobilized, and there was a serious phenomenon of bureaucratism and paternalism. After the signing of collective contracts, the workers' enthusiasm increased, and the leadership was able to boldly let the workers do their work and focus their attention on the planning and arrangement of work. For example, when planting cotton last year, the leaders were afraid of making mistakes, running around looking here and there, and were very busy. This year, they focused on soaking seeds and promoting germination, and let the workers do the other field work themselves. As a result, 378.66 acres of cotton were sown in five days, one day ahead of the original plan.
　　The second achievement: Production efficiency has been significantly improved due to the workers' competition to create new record-breaking achievements. For example, in spreading manure, the daily quota for two people and two horses was 28 carts, and the new record was increased to 48 carts, exceeding the quota by 71.4%; for harrowing, the daily quota was 35 mu, and the new record was 62.5 mu, exceeding the original efficiency by 78.6%; for digging irrigation ditches (i.e., ditches for irrigating the land), the quota was 1,300 meters, and the new record was 2,500 meters, exceeding the quota by 92.3%. The lowest of all efficiency quotas exceeded 14.3%, and the highest exceeded the quota by 92.3%. This year's work efficiency is generally higher than last year. For example, manure spreading work increased by 92% compared to last year, harrowing increased by 78.6% compared to last year, digging irrigation ditches increased by 150% compared to last year, and bone meal crushing exceeded last year by 87.7%. For the quota work in the first quarter production plan this year, 117.24 labor units were required, but only 105 were used, saving 43.38 labor units compared to last year. This is the actual situation in the implementation of the contract.
　　The following methods were adopted in implementing the collective contract:
　　1. Using blackboards for commendation and criticism. 2. Conducting in-depth inspection and registration. In order to ensure the full realization of the contract, the work efficiency of each worker was thoroughly inspected, and the results of the inspection were recorded in detail every day. This not only provided a basis for evaluation and awards, but also made the workers understand that the leadership was earnestly responsible for implementing all the provisions of the contract, and strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility for their work. 3. Grasping specific examples for repeated education. For example, in April, worker Duan Shuanzi slept on the north electric well at night, and the foreign irrigation ditch ran water, and the bean field was flooded. Later, 8 kilograms of gasoline were used for pumping water, and 14 more labor units were used for loosening the soil, and the broad bean production may also be reduced. The administration used this example to educate the workers, explaining that not only the public suffered losses, but also affected everyone's year-end bonus. In this way, the workers' sense of responsibility for their work was improved, and they could supervise each other in their work.
　　However, some problems also occurred in the implementation of the contract: 1. The problem of work without efficiency quotas: In the contract, work without efficiency quotas accounted for about 70% of all work. Workers liked to do quota work, but didn't like to do work without quotas. Solutions: 1. Try to find reasonable quotas for work without quotas and add them to the contract at any time, so that all work gradually has quotas; 2. Strive to reasonably allocate work with quotas to each person, so that everyone has the opportunity to exceed the quota; 3. List work without efficiency quotas as one of the key points in the evaluation criteria, and the evaluation criteria should focus on work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. 2. The problem of uneven draft animal power: Because of the different strengths and degrees of training of draft animals, problems also occurred in the use of draft animals and striving to exceed quotas. Some workers were unable to exceed quotas because their livestock were old and weak and they needed to take care of them, and others were affected by the fact that their livestock were not very tame. The administration made reasonable adjustments to all livestock according to their physical strength and degree of tameness, so that the differences were not too great. 3. The difficulty of quantifying the quality of work: Because it is difficult to measure the quality of agricultural production work with accurate scientific methods. For example, if the land in the cotton field is cultivated very smoothly, it can save a lot of labor in the next step. For example, the labor required for the grass removal operation after cotton field cultivation accounts for about 29% of the entire land preparation work. If fine cultivation can be carried out, a lot of labor can be saved. Solution: Skilled workers are rated at levels 6 and 7 when evaluating wages to encourage them; at the same time, they are called upon to study technology and work carefully; usually, political education is strengthened for workers to enlighten their awareness, and continue to improve their understanding of collective contracts, so that they will not reduce the quality of work in order to get bonuses for exceeding quotas. 4. When the contract began to be signed, the workers found it difficult to accept the quotas because many specific conditions were not met, so the efficiency quotas should not be too high at the beginning, so as to encourage the workers' enthusiasm and enthusiasm; but after production has been improved, the quota standards should be gradually increased so that the production quotas do not remain at the current level and improve work efficiency. The leadership must properly grasp this point.

### 河北农场签订集体合同后  生产效率显著提高  播种、耙地等成绩超过去年

　　河北农场签订集体合同后
    生产效率显著提高
    播种、耙地等成绩超过去年
    【本报石家庄讯】石家庄河北农场在实施和贯彻集体合同中，由于行政和工人的共同努力，今年第一季生产工作，已获显著成绩。
    第一个最大的收获，就是改进了领导。该场在去年由于工人还没有普遍发动起来，一切工作都不能放手去搞，事务主义、包办代替的现象，相当严重。集体合同签订后，工人积极性提高，领导上就能大胆放手让工人去作，而把自己的注意力着重在对工作的计划和布置上。如种棉花，去年播种时，领导上唯恐出错，东跑跑西看看，忙得不可开交；今年则把重点放在浸种和催芽上，别的田间工作都让工人自己去进行，结果三七八·六六亩棉花，五天内就全部播种完毕，较原订计划提前了一天。
    第二个收获：由于工人展开了创造超额新纪录的比赛，生产效率有很显著提高。如散粪，二人二马一日工作定额是二十八车，超额新纪录则提高到四十八车，超额百分之七一·四；耙地，每天定额三十五亩，超额新纪录是六二·五亩，超过原定效率百分之七八·六；掏淋沟（即浇地流水沟），定额一千三百米，超额新纪录是二千五百米，超过百分之九二·三。所有各项效率定额中，最低者亦超过了百分之一四·三，最高者超过定额百分之九二·三。工作效率今年大都较去年为高。如散粪工作，今年比去年提高百分之九二，耙地比去年提高百分之七八·六，掏淋沟比去年提高百分之一五○，轧骨粉超过去年百分之八七·七。今年第一季度生产计划的定额工作，需用人工一一七·二四个，但仅用了一○五个，较去年省工四三·三八个。这就是合同执行中的实际情形。
    在贯彻集体合同中，采用了以下办法：
    一、通过黑板报进行表扬和批评。二、进行深入的检查和登记。为了保证合同的全部实现，对每个工人的工作效率都进行了深入的检查，并将检查结果逐日详细登记，这不仅使评奖有了根据，并使工人了解领导上是认真负责来执行合同的一切规定的，也加强了工人的工作责任心。三、抓紧具体实例，进行反复教育。如四月间因工人段拴子夜间在北电井上睡觉，洋淋沟跑了水，扁豆地被淹了，后来抽水时用了八斤汽油，还多用了十四个人工松土，扁豆还可能减产；行政上就以这个实例，在工人中进行教育，说明不仅公家受到损失，也影响到大家的年终分红。这样，工人的工作责任心就提高了，对工作能互相督促。
    但在合同的执行中也发生了一些问题：一、无效率定额的工作问题：在合同中，无效率定额的工作，约占全部工作十分之七，工人喜欢作定额工作，而不喜欢作无定额的工作。解决的办法：１、对无定额的工作，尽量找出合理定额来，随时增加到合同中去，使全部工作都逐渐有了定额；２、有定额的工作，则力求合理的分配给每个人去作，使每个人都有超额的机会；３、将无效率定额的工作，列为评奖标准重点之一，而评奖标准以工作积极性、责任心为主。二、畜力不均的问题：因畜力强弱和驯熟程度不同，也在使用畜力和争取超过定额问题上，发生了问题。有的因为牲口老弱，为照顾畜力，工作就不能超额，有的因为牲口不甚驯服，也影响其超额工作。行政上即将全部牲畜根据体力强弱及驯顺程度，加以合理的调剂，作到悬殊不大。三、工作定质困难问题：由于农业生产工作在质量上很难用准确的科学方法去衡量。如棉田整地工作，在耕地如果耕得十分平整，可使下一步工作省去许多劳力。如棉田耕地后的撩草作业，所需劳力约占全部整地工作百分之二十九。若能精耕细作，则能减省许多工。解决的办法：对技术熟练的工人，在评定工资时，都评到六七级，以资鼓励；同时号召钻研技术，工作精细；平时对工人加强政治教育，启发其觉悟性，继续提高其对集体合同的认识，使之不要为了超额得奖而降低工作质量。四、在合同开始签订时，因许多具体条件不具备，定额定高了工人就难于接受，因此在效率定额上开始不宜过高，这样才可以鼓励工人的积极性和热情；但在生产已有改进之后，即应逐步将定额标准加以提高，才能使生产定额不停留在现有水平上，提高工作效率。这一点领导上必须适当的掌握。
