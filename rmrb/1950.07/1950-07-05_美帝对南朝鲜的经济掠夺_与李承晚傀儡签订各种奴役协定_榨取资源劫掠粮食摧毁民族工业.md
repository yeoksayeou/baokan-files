Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 1st: The colonial plunder policy of the US imperialists has driven the South Korean economy to a state of total decline. Even during the US military government's rule over South Korea, US imperialists had already taken control of 90% of the South Korean economy. After the establishment of the Lee Seung-man puppet regime, the United States signed many agreements enslaving South Korea, such as the "Korean-American Agreement," the "Korean-American Economic Agreement," and the "Petroleum Agreement." These "agreements" gave the United States complete control over South Korea's economy. According to the "Korean-American Economic Agreement," American capitalists obtained the exclusive rights to mine tungsten in the mountain caves and Suling areas, as well as several other mineral deposits. Many joint-stock companies using the name "Korea" were established, such as the "Korea Petroleum Joint-Stock Company" and the "Korea Coal Mining Company," but in fact, the real power of these companies was entirely in the hands of American monopoly capitalists.

Utilizing the so-called "Korean-American Agreement on Technical Assistance for Korean Shipping," US imperialists controlled South Korea's foreign trade and shipping. As a result of the US's monopolistic power, by the end of 1948, 70% of the original enterprises in South Korea before the arrival of the Americans had closed down. The number of workers employed in South Korean industry had shrunk from 300,520 to 125,000.

The destruction of South Korea's national economy by the US imperialists has had a disastrous impact on South Korea's foreign trade. In 1948, South Korea's imports were twenty times greater than its exports. The South Korean market was flooded with American goods, fundamentally destroying South Korea's national industry, and its production decreased by 81.4% compared to 1940.

The textile industry is in a severe crisis. In 1949, South Korea only produced 1.79 million bolts of various fabrics (with each bolt approximately equal to 20 meters), while its output in 1938 was 6 million bolts. The area for planting cotton has decreased sharply. As a result, 70% of the raw materials for South Korea's textile industry depend on the import of American cotton.

The situation regarding electricity generation is not much better. US imperialists have restored thermal power plants in South Korea, with the aim of creating a market for outdated American equipment such as diesel generators.

Under the direction of the US imperialists, the Lee Seung-man clique has protected the feudal land tenancy system and backward, primitive farming methods, and has implemented a policy of violently plundering the peasants. The United States exports millions of "shi" of rice (one shi equals 160 kilograms) from South Korea to Japan every year, while South Korea, originally the granary of the entire Korean peninsula, is now experiencing a severe shortage of food and has to import American aged grain. In 1948, South Korea's sown area was only 66% of the average sown area from 1940 to 1944. Agricultural production has declined sharply. Inflation continues to develop.

　　美帝对南朝鲜的经济掠夺
    与李承晚傀儡签订各种奴役协定  榨取资源劫掠粮食摧毁民族工业
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社平壤一日讯：美帝国主义者的殖民地劫掠政策，已把南朝鲜经济驱上全盘衰落的境地。早在美国军政府统治南朝鲜的时期，美帝国主义者即已染指南朝鲜经济百分之九十。在李承晚傀儡政权成立以后，美国和他签订了许多奴役南朝鲜的协定，例如：“韩美协定”、“韩美经济协定”、“石油协定”等等。这些“协定”使美国对南朝鲜的经济取得了彻底的控制。按照“韩美经济协定”，美国资本家取得了开采山洞和苏陵两地钨矿和若干其他矿藏的独占权利。许多以“韩国”字样做幌子的股份公司成立了，例如“韩国石油股份公司”、“韩国采煤公司”等等，然而事实上这些公司的实权都完全操在美国垄断资本家的手里。
    利用了所谓“韩美关于技术援助韩国航运的协定”，美帝国主义者控制了南朝鲜的国外贸易和航运。由于美国势力独占的结果，至一九四八年年底，南朝鲜在美国人未到来以前的原有的企业中，已有百分之七十倒闭。南朝鲜工业雇用的工人数目，已从三十万零五百二十人缩小至十二万五千人。
    美帝国主义者对南朝鲜国民经济的毁坏，对于南朝鲜的国外贸易有着惨重的影响。在一九四八年，南朝鲜的入口较出口大二十倍。南朝鲜市场泛滥着美国货物，从根本上摧毁了南朝鲜的民族工业，它的生产和一九四○年比较，降低了百分之八十一点四。
    纺织工业处在严重的危机中。南朝鲜在一九四九年仅出产各种织物一百七十九万匹（按每匹约等于二十公尺），而它在一九三八年的产量是六百万匹。植棉的面积急剧地下降。因此南朝鲜的纺织工业原料有百分之七十依赖美国棉花的输入。
    发电量的境况也不见得好一点。美帝国主义者在南朝鲜恢复了火力发电厂，目的是要替过时的美国装备如笛塞尔发电机等创造市场。
    在美帝国主义者的指示之下，李承晚集团保护了封建的土地租佃制度和落后原始的耕作方法，并且施行了狂暴地掠夺农民的政策。美国每年从南朝鲜把数百万石米（按一石等于一百六十公斤）向日本输出，而原为全朝鲜谷仓的南朝鲜，目前也感到了粮食的严重缺乏，以致不得不输入美国的陈年粮食。在一九四八年，南朝鲜的播种面积只及一九四○——一九四四年的平均播种面积的百分之六十六。农业生产尖锐地下降。通货膨胀在继续发展中。
