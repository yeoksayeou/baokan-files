　　Suburban Areas Flooded by Continuous Heavy Rains
    Villages Actively Drain Water to Save Crops
    [Report from this newspaper] Due to continuous rain, many areas in the suburbs of Beijing have experienced severe flooding because the rivers and canals are narrow and shallow. The areas east, northeast, and southeast of Fengtai, as well as near Guang'anmen, are the most severely affected by water accumulation. The entire village of Nanfengwo has been flooded, with water depths ranging from four feet in some places to over a foot in others. On the night of the heavy rain on the 17th, the Fifteenth District Committee immediately dispatched personnel to brave the rain and provide assistance. The next day, it instructed cadres of the work team stationed in the villages to lead the masses in draining water and preventing floods with all their might. In addition to dispatching capable cadres to form two groups to lead the masses in draining water in the most severely affected villages, the District Committee, District Government, and Public Security Bureau also convened a joint meeting of village chiefs and Party branch secretaries from the villages most affected by the disaster to take emergency flood prevention measures. It was decided to immediately mobilize the masses to use various methods to drain water and save crops, putting forward slogans such as "Save every plant that can be saved," "Save every field that can be saved," and "Oppose waiting for sunny days and relying on fate." Farmers were also mobilized to organize joint drainage efforts among villages or several households. Submerged seedlings will be replanted or re-sown. Those whose houses have collapsed will temporarily share accommodations with others.

    [Report from this newspaper] On the evening of the 17th, a torrential rain caused the water level in the West Canal of Yinghaizhuang Village, Fourteenth District, to overflow the banks, flooding 1,300 mu of land in Tongxinzhuang and Xinyizhuang. Currently, the farmers in the area are actively draining the accumulated water. On the evening of the 18th, the Xishun Water Canal in Sihezhuang Village breached, but over a hundred local farmers completed the emergency repair within two hours. The accumulated water in the flooded area at the time of the breach was also completely drained by the 19th. This breach will not have a significant impact on spring crops, but the late-planted crops may experience reduced yields. According to farmers in the district, "Fortunately, the Fenghe and Lianghe rivers were dredged this year, otherwise such heavy rain would have caused a major disaster."

　　郊区连日大雨成涝
    各村积极排水抢救庄稼
    【本报讯】连日阴雨，京郊各地因各河渠浅窄，被淹土地甚多。丰台以东、东北、东南部，及广安门附近积水，大为严重。南蜂窝全村被淹，地中积水深者四尺，浅者尺余，十五区委会十七日下大雨的当夜即派员冒雨前往抢救，翌日又指示下乡工作组干部，要以全力领导群众排水防涝。区委会、区政府及公安分局除抽调得力干部组成两个小组到受灾较重村庄领导群众排水外，并召集灾情较重各村村长、支部书记联席会议，作紧急防涝措置，决定立即发动群众用各种方法排水抢救，提出：“救一棵算一棵”，“救一片算一片”，“反对等晴天听天由命”等口号。并动员农民组织联村或几户联合排水。被淹禾苗将进行补种或重种。房屋塌倒者暂时挤并借居。

    【本报讯】十七日晚倾盆大雨，十四区瀛海庄村西水渠水势漫出渠岸，同心庄、信义庄一千三百亩土地被淹，现该地农民正在积极排除积水。十八日晚四合庄村西顺水渠决口，当地百余农民于两小时内抢堵完竣。决口时被淹地内之积水，在十九日亦已全部排出。此次决口对春作物影响不大，部分麦楂晚作物可能减收。据该区农民谈：“幸亏今年挖了凤河、凉河，不然这样大雨，要遭大灾害了。”
