Chongqing Power Company Leaders Neglect Cleanup Work
5,000 Kilowatt Generator Left to Corrode in the Open

The Daxi Gou Power Plant of the Chongqing Power Company, due to the leadership's lack of a concept of cherishing state property and failure to implement the central government's decision on cleaning up materials, still has a brand-new 5,000-kilowatt turbine generator (totaling 370 tons including parts) left outdoors, exposed to wind and rain. All parts are now rusty, and some pipes and components have begun to corrode.

This machine was shipped from Shanghai to Chongqing in 1948 (there are only three 5,000-kilowatt turbine generators like this in the Southwest, one of which is already broken). During the Kuomintang rule, due to the bureaucratization of the Kuomintang management agencies, this machine was not installed, and all parts were left scattered in the square inside the Daxi Gou Power Plant. Before taking over the Chongqing Power Company after liberation, Comrade Luo Shigao, Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government, and Comrade Li Zhongzhi, Director of the Municipal Construction Bureau, served as directors and chairmen of the company. In early April, when the central government called for cleaning up materials, the plant did not carry out cleanup work, and the leading comrades neglected to supervise this work.

On May 4, the Military Control Commission sent military representative Zhu Guanglin and other working comrades to take over the three power plants under the jurisdiction of the power company. The working comrades who went to take over the Daxi Gou Power Plant reported to the military representative on the first day of the takeover (May 4) about the erosion of the machine by wind and rain and the urgent need to build a shed for repairs; they later mentioned this matter every time they reported on their work. However, Military Representative Zhu Guanglin did not pay attention to this issue until May 15. He instructed the General Affairs Section of the power company to handle this matter, asked him to contact the Southwest Construction Company for shed construction, and appointed Huang Dayou, the former head of the General Affairs Section, to be responsible. Budgeting, negotiating labor prices, and signing contracts dragged on for another twenty days. As a result, the contract was not signed until early June. However, more than half a month has passed, but the plant's machine shed has not yet started construction.

Half a month ago, when the central material inventory team went to the plant to inspect materials, they discovered the damage to this important machine and instructed to build a shed for repairs as soon as possible. Later, when the Material Allocation Committee inspected bureaucratic work styles, it also criticized the plant. However, Representative Zhu issued orders and allocated funds, but did not follow up on this matter, nor did he specifically inspect and supervise the work. The Southwest Construction Company's lack of credibility and failure to fulfill the contract's provisions is also a reason for the machine's further damage.

### 重庆电力公司领导上不重视清理工作  五千千瓦发电机听任露天腐蚀

　　重庆电力公司领导上不重视清理工作
    五千千瓦发电机听任露天腐蚀
    重庆电力公司大溪沟电力厂，由于领导上缺乏爱护国家财产的观念，没有贯彻中央关于清理物资工作的决定，至今还有一部全新的五千千瓦的透平发电机（和零件一起合计三百七十吨），扔在屋子外边，任其风蚀雨淋。现全部零件已生了锈，部分管子与零件开始腐蚀。
    这部机器是在一九四八年从上海运到重庆的（在西南像这样五千千瓦的透平发电机只有三部，其中有一部已坏）。在国民党统治时代，由于国民党管理机关的官僚化，没有把这架机器装置起来，任令全部零件散置在大溪沟电力厂内的广场上。解放后在接管重庆电力公司以前，重庆市人民政府秘书长罗士高同志，市府建设局局长李仲直同志任该公司董事与董事长。四月初，中央号召清理物资时，该厂并未进行清理工作，领导同志也疏忽了对这一工作的督促。
    五月四日军管会派军事代表朱广林及其他工作同志接管了电力公司所属的三个发电厂。前往接管大溪沟发电厂的工作同志，在接管的第一天（五月四日），就将这架机器被风雨侵蚀的情形与急需搭棚修理的情况向军事代表报告；后来并在每次汇报工作时都提到这件事。可是军事代表朱广林同志直到五月十五日才开始注意这个问题。指示电力公司总务科办理此事，要他与西南建筑公司接洽搭棚事宜，并由原总务科长黄大有负责。造预算、讲工价、订合同，又拖了二十天。结果六月初才订立合同。可是半月多了，但该厂的机器棚仍未动工。
    半月前，中央物资清查团前往该厂检查物资时，发觉这部重要机器被损坏的情况，当面指示从速搭棚修理。后来物资调配委员会检查官僚主义作风时，亦对该厂提出批评。但是朱代表发了命令、拨了款子后，就对此事没有过问，不具体检查与督促工作。西南建筑公司缺乏信用，不履行合同的规定，也是使机器多受损害的一个原因。
