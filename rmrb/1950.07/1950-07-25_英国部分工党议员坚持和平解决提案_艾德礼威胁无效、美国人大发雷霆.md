Xinhua News Agency, London Dispatch from TASS, July 22nd: Reports indicate that British Prime Minister Attlee, in a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party group on the 19th, demanded that the twenty-three Labour MPs immediately withdraw their proposal in the House of Commons calling for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. However, Attlee's demand did not sway the majority of those who had signed the proposal.

The political commentator of the *Workers' Daily* pointed out: This proposal has infuriated the Americans, and it is very difficult for the British government to downplay the significance of the proposal when explaining this matter to the Americans. Mr. Shiffman, one of the proponents of the proposal, said in response to Attlee: Every possible effort should be made to avoid war, ensure international coordination, and eliminate the Cold War. He said: Britain's primary concern is to maintain peace. If Britain takes any other path, it will inevitably lead to destruction. He also said: The MPs who signed the proposal demand that the US military withdraw from Korea and that a representative of the People's Republic of China become a member of the Security Council.

The *Workers' Daily* continued: At the Parliamentary Labour Party group meeting held on July 19th, in addition to those MPs who had already signed the proposal, many other Labour MPs also supported Mr. Shiffman.

　　英国部分工党议员坚持和平解决提案
    艾德礼威胁无效、美国人大发雷霆
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：据报载，英首相艾德礼十九日在议会工党小组的会议中，要求那二十三个工党议员立刻撤回他们在下院所提出的关于呼吁和平解决朝鲜问题一事的提案。然而，艾德礼的要求，对于曾在提案上署名的那些人之中的多数人，并没有发生效力。
    《工人日报》政治评论员指出：这个提案已使美国人大发雷霆，英国政府在就这件事对美国人解释的时候，要蔑视那个提案的重大意义是非常困难的。那个提案的提案人之一席福曼在答复艾德礼的时候说：应该作一切可能的努力以避免战争，确保国际协调，和消除冷战。他说：英国最关心的事情就是保持和平。如果英国走上任何别的道路，就不可避免地会走向毁灭。他又说：在那提案上署名的议员们，要求美军退出朝鲜，要求使中华人民共和国的代表成为安全理事会的理事。
    工人日报继称：在七月十九日举行的议会工党小组的会议上，除了已在那提案上署名的那些议员以外，许多工党议员们也都支持席福曼。
