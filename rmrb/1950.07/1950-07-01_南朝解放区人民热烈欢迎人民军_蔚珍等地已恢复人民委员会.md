Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th (TASS): Residents of the South Korean cities and villages that have been liberated are wholeheartedly welcoming their liberators – the People's Army and the constabulary, who have inflicted devastating blows on the Syngman Rhee's army and police. Mass rallies are being held in many places, where residents are discussing the issue of restoring the People's Committees and preparing for the implementation of land reform. Residents in various places have exposed the traitorous activities of the Syngman Rhee clique and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the People's Army and guerrillas.

Such gatherings have been held in Yeongil, Gyeongju, Gimpo, and other regions. In Ulchin, Yeoncheon, Yeonbaek, and many other regions of South Korea, the People's Committees have been restored, and the remnants of the Syngman Rhee fascist regime have been eliminated. These regions are fully preparing to implement land reform. After the registration of land owned by the Japanese and traitors of the homeland is completed, the land will be distributed to the peasants free of charge.

　　南朝解放区人民热烈欢迎人民军
    蔚珍等地已恢复人民委员会
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社平壤二十九日电：获得解放的南朝鲜城乡居民正在衷心地欢迎他们的解放者——予李承晚的军队与警察以毁灭性打击的人民军和警备队。许多地方纷纷举行群众大会，居民在会上讨论恢复人民委员会的问题和有关准备实行土地改革的问题。各地居民揭露了李承晚集团的卖国活动，并衷心感激人民军与游击队。
    迎日、庆州、金浦及其他地区都举行了这样的集会。在蔚珍、涟川、延白及南朝鲜的其他许多地区，人民委员会已经恢复，而李承晚法西斯政权的残余也已经消灭了。这些地区正在全力准备实行土地改革。在日本人和祖国的叛徒所拥有的土地登记完毕后，土地即将无偿地分配给农民。
