　　The Beijing Private Yuhua Xing Weaving Factory Branch Implements the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit
　　Lin Zhenxin
　　In the year and a half since liberation, the private Yuhua Xing Weaving Factory in the Seventh District of Beijing has experienced a tortuous path in labor-capital relations. Before November of last year, it was losing money every month. In mid-November, it was shut down for more than a month due to a lack of raw materials. After the factory resumed work at the end of January this year, it was able to make money every month. The key to this transformation lies in the implementation of the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit by the factory's Communist Party branch.
　　The Yuhua Xing Weaving Factory branch was established in October last year. At that time, the workers did not realize that the development of private factories was in line with the current interests of the working class. Therefore, their work attitude was poor, output was low, quality was bad, and wages were too high. At that time, each worker in the factory wove an average of about 26 bolts of cloth per month, and the wage was about 300 catties of rice. The capitalists, due to ideological concerns, also relaxed their management, resulting in even greater losses for the factory. In November, the supply of raw materials could not keep up, and the factory was forced to shut down. At that time, the capitalists even said they would quit and let the workers be the managers. At the beginning of its establishment, the branch was not clear about its mission. The branch secretary, Zang Qisan, only knew that party members should study hard so that they could "get along anywhere" with more knowledge. Later, after studying in the Party Training Class and receiving instructions from the higher party committee, the branch realized that it should lead the workers to assist the capitalists in improving production. However, the branch made a serious mistake of coercion and commandism. When party members saw some workers idle and not working hard, they glared and acted aggressively, forcing others to work. Party member Gao Baocheng once drove people onto the machines with a stick. The branch's leadership of the trade union was also based on simple orders. The branch's resolutions were often simply read out at the trade union committee and then implemented by the trade union. Sometimes, the branch even carried out work directly without going through the trade union, which seriously separated it from the masses. Some workers said, "Is this factory run by you few people?!" But they did not dare to boldly express their opinions in meetings attended by party members. Therefore, the branch was unable to organize the masses to implement its work plan.
　　After the factory shut down, the branch first reviewed within the party the main reasons why the factory's production was not doing well. After analysis and research, it was clarified that one of the important problems was that the branch members and the masses had a vague understanding of the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit, and the branch and its members had made the mistake of coercion and commandism in their work. In the future, it was necessary to patiently educate the masses on the policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit," so that the masses could understand that one of the main reasons for the factory shutdown was that everyone wanted to "earn more money and work less." It also called on everyone to learn from the Jingwei Weaving Factory, which had the best work in the district. At this time, the branch, together with the trade union, seized the opportunity of the shutdown to organize the masses for cultural and political studies. Party members helped them to clear their minds by chatting with the masses during their spare time. In addition, the fact of the "shutdown" had already given the masses a profound practical lesson. Soon, the masses' views on production began to change. Worker Sun Lu talked about his ideological changes at a group meeting to review his work attitude. He said: "When we were first liberated, I thought that we had been exploited by the capitalists in the past, and now that we were liberated, we should earn more money and eat better. If the capitalists dared to come to me, I would argue with them. Last year, in June and July, when the dyeing and weaving industry trade union and the capitalists were negotiating the collective contract, we all knew that once the contract was signed, wages would have to fall, so we all hoped that the contract would be delayed. Only then did I realize that our thinking at that time was wrong. I realized that in private factories, we should talk about 'labor-capital mutual benefit,' and the development of the factory is also good for the workers." Youth League member Huang Jinchu also said, "We didn't know these things in the past, but if we had known them earlier, we would have done even better than the Jingwei factory!" After the masses' thinking changed, the branch took the initiative to draft a plan to appropriately reduce wages, discussed and researched it among the masses, and then made a decision to provide it to the capitalists for adoption.
　　In early January, the capitalists borrowed yarn from the People's Bank of China to prepare for the resumption of work. Based on the workers' original work attitude, they estimated that it would take at least a month to prepare the work (tying 32 machines). However, due to the change in the workers' work attitude, after the branch led everyone in discussions, the workers set a plan to tie 32 machines in 20 days to resume work. As a result, it was completed in 10 days.
　　When the resumption of work began, the Youth League members took the lead in cleaning the machines and factory buildings, and moving yarn. The party members rushed to do the heavy work, and the masses were in high spirits for production. The branch also frequently convened symposiums of workers from various departments through the trade union to encourage everyone to make rationalization proposals and overcome difficulties in production. In particular, the suggestions of reducing the number of revolutions of the shafts and lowering the reeds were put forward at the symposiums, which improved the efficiency of the shafts, and the standard of three shafts per day was completed. It also reduced yarn breakage, which played a decisive role in completing the plan ahead of schedule.
　　The factory resumed work on January 28. Shortly after the resumption of work was the Spring Festival. According to the old practice, the Spring Festival would have to be closed for 10 days, and wages would be paid as usual, which would increase the factory's difficulties. The branch then used party members to encourage the masses to suggest automatically reducing the holidays. After discussion by the trade union, the workers unanimously agreed to propose to the capitalists to reduce the holidays by four days in order to improve production. In late March, when goods were slow to sell in the market, the factory did not encounter any difficulties because it had signed a processing contract with a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army for 2,000 bolts of city cloth, the processing fee was high, and the raw materials were obtained in advance, so little working capital was required. In addition, the branch and the trade union led the workers to formulate two production plans, and the workers put forward rationalization proposals, changing the past practice of mixing round and flat shuttle thread, to using round shuttle thread to make shafts and flat shuttle thread to make tassels, which improved the weft speed and greatly increased the factory's production efficiency. The production efficiency increased from 152% to 201% compared to October. The average monthly cloth production per person increased from 26.5 bolts to 53.3 bolts. The factory has been continuously making profits since April, and the capitalists' confidence in management has increased, and they no longer complain about losses. At the same time, the factory has also paid attention to saving and improving management.
　　In summarizing this period of work, the branch found that the intensity of workers' labor had been raised too high during this period, and the leadership had not corrected it in time, which affected the health of individual workers. At the same time, the quality assurance was poor. In May, it was proposed to maintain the level of weaving 50 bolts of cloth per person per month and pay attention to improving quality.
　　During this period of work, the relationship between the party and the masses has also been greatly improved. Now, the masses can not only respond to the party's call, discuss problems with the party, but also dare to put forward critical opinions to the party and help party members to make progress.

　　北京私营裕华兴织布厂支部
    贯彻劳资两利政策
    林珍心
    北京市第七区私营裕华兴织布厂在解放后的一年半时间中，在劳资关系上经历了曲折的道路。去年十一月前每月要赔累。十一月中又因原料供给不上，停工一个多月。今年一月底该厂开始复工后，每月可以赚钱。该厂之所以有这样一个转变，其关键在于该厂中共支部贯彻了劳资两利的政策。
    裕华兴织布厂支部是去年十月建立的。当时工友们还没有认识到私营工厂生产的发展与工人阶级目前的利益是一致的，因而劳动态度不好，产量低，质量坏，而且工资过高。当时该厂工人，每人每月织布平均约二十六匹，工资米就要三百斤左右。资方因为思想上有顾虑，也放松了经营管理，以致厂中赔累更多。十一月份原料供应不上，竟至停工。当时资方甚至说不干了，要工人当经理等等。支部在建立之初，也不明确自己的任务是什么。支部书记臧岂三就只知道党员应好好学习，为的是：懂得多了到那都吃得开。后来经过在党训班的学习，和上级党委的指示，支部才知道了应该领导工人协助资方搞好生产。但是支部又犯了严重的强迫命令的偏向。党员见有些工人呆着不好好干活，就瞪眼睛耍态度，逼着别人去干活。党员高宝成曾经拿棍子赶人上机子。支部对工会的领导也只是用简单的命令方式。支部的决议常常只在工会委员会上宣读一下就让工会执行。有时甚至不通过工会直接去搞工作，因而严重的脱离了群众。有的工友说：“工厂难道是你们几个开的吗？！”但又不敢在有党员参加的会议上大胆发表自己的意见。支部也就无法组织群众来实现自己的工作计划。
    该厂停工以后，支部首先在党内检讨本厂生产搞不好的主要原因。经过分析研究，明确了重要问题之一在于支部党员和群众对劳资两利的政策认识模糊，而支部和党员在工作中又犯了强迫命令错误。今后必须耐心向群众进行“劳资两利”的政策教育，使群众认识工厂停工的主要原因之一是由于大家“多挣钱、少干活”。并号召大家向本区工作最好的经纬织布厂学习。这时支部便协同工会，抓紧停工时机，组织群众进行文化和政治学习。党员在课余和群众闲扯中帮助他们打通思想。加上“停工”这一事实已经给予群众一个深刻的实际的教训。不久，群众对生产的看法开始转变了。工友孙录在一次检讨劳动态度的小组会上谈自己的思想变化情形，他说：“刚解放时，我认为过去受资本家的剥削，今天解放了，就要多挣钱，吃点好的。要是资本家敢找我的话，我就顶他。去年六、七月间染织业工会和资方谈判集体合同时，咱大伙知道合同一下来，工资就得落，因此都盼着合同拖着别订下来。这时才知道了那会儿的想法是不对的。才知道在私营工厂里应当讲‘劳资两利’，厂子发展了，对工人同样有好处。”团员黄觐墀也说：“过去咱们不知道这些，要是早知道了，干的比经纬厂还强！”群众思想转变后，支部又主动拟出了适当减低工资的方案，在群众中讨论研究，而后作出决定，提供资方采纳。
    一月初，资方向人民银行贷了纱准备复工。他们根据工友们原来的劳动态度，估计进行准备工作（拴齐三十二台机子）至少得一个月。但是，由于工友们劳动态度改变了，经过支部领导大家讨论，工友们订出了二十天拴齐三十二台机子的复工计划。结果十天就完成了。
    复工工作开始，团员们带头清扫机子厂房，搬纱，党员抢着干重活，群众生产情绪很高。支部又通过工会经常召开各部门工人的座谈会，鼓励大家进行合理化建议，克服生产中的困难。特别是在座谈会上提出了减少轮轴转数和降低篦子的建议，提高了轮轴的效率，每日三个轴的标准得以完成，并且减少了断线，对于计划提前完成起了决定作用。
    一月二十八日工厂复工了。复工不久就是春节。若按过去旧例，春节须放假十天，工资照发，这样又会增加厂中的困难。支部便通过党员在群众中酝酿自动减少假日的建议。经过工会讨论，工友们一致同意为了搞好生产，自动向资方提出减少假日四天的建议。三月下旬市场上货物滞销时，该厂由于和人民解放军某部订立了二千匹市布的加工合同，加工费较高，又是先期取得原料，需要流动资金很少，因此未遇到什么困难。加上支部协同工会领导工人订立两次生产计划，工人又提出了合理化建议，把过去圆拴线和扁拴线混着使的办法，改变为用圆拴线打轴，用扁拴线打穗的方法，提高了颗纬速度，全厂生产效率大大提高，较十月份提高到百分之一百五十二到二百零一。每人每月平均产布由二十六点五匹增到五十三点三匹。四月份的生产超额完成，突破了全区生产记录。自四月份起，厂中已连续获利，资方经营信心提高，再也不喊赔累了。同时厂中也注意了节约和改进经营管理。
    在总结这一段工作时，支部发现这一段时间工人劳动强度提得太高，而领导上未及时改正，以致个别工人的健康受到了影响。同时在保证质量上作的较差。在五月份就提出保持每人每月织布五十匹的水平，注意改进质量。
    在这一段工作中，党群关系也已大大改善。现在群众不但能响应党的号召，有问题同党商量，并且敢于向党提出批评的意见，帮助党员们进步。
