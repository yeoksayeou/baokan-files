　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: TASS, New York, June 30th: American newspaper reports show that the American command in South Korea is frantically trying to stop the retreat of the South Korean army. The New York Times reported that Brigadier General Church, the new commander of the U.S. military "advisory" group in South Korea, has flown from Tokyo to South Korea.

　　All newspapers reported the details of the South Korean army and American military "advisors" fleeing in disarray from Seoul. New York Herald reporter Higgins reported that Li Seung-man's supporters fled so hastily that South Korean officers blew up the bridge over the Han River while thousands of South Korean soldiers were still crossing it. All these people were killed. Members of the U.S. military mission were forced to flee, leaving all their personal belongings behind. Since the bridge had been blown up, they could only use their guns to force demoralized South Korean soldiers to continue crossing the river.

　　According to dispatches from various news agency reporters, many American military "advisors" had to swim across the Han River. Higgins reported that she saw the Minister of Interior of the South Korean puppet "government" carrying a bag and fleeing for his life on the road south of Seoul.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd dispatch: According to the Korean Central News Agency quoting Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, June 30th: Li Seung-man's "resident delegation in Japan" announced that Li Seung-man had dismissed Chae Byeong-deok, the chief of staff of the pseudo-"National Defense Forces," due to the disastrous military defeat. The post of Chief of General Staff of the pseudo-"National Defense Forces" has been taken over by Ding Yiquan. Ding Yiquan was originally the Deputy Chief of General Staff of the pseudo-"National Defense Forces" and went to the United States in April to "study American military science," but was recalled by Li Seung-man in less than a month to plan and launch a civil war.

　　在朝鲜人民军英勇打击下
    李承晚匪帮狼狈南窜
    美军“顾问”泅水渡江逃命
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约六月三十日讯：美国报纸消息显示：南朝鲜的美国指挥部，正在手忙脚乱地努力阻止南朝鲜军队的撤退。纽约时报报道：南朝鲜美国军事“顾问”团新任团长邱奇准将，已自东京搭机飞抵南朝鲜。
    各报都报道南朝鲜军队与美国军事“顾问”们自汉城狼狈逃窜的详情。纽约先驱报记者赫金斯报道，李承晚的支持者们窜逃得如此匆促，以致南朝鲜军官在数千名南朝鲜兵士还在渡过汉江上的桥的时候便把桥炸了。这些人都被炸死了。美国军事使团的团员们被迫逃亡，将他们所有的个人行李留在后面，桥梁既已被炸，他们只能够用枪胁迫士气涣散的南朝鲜兵士继续进行渡江。
    据各通讯社记者的电讯称，许多美国军事“顾问”不得不游泳渡过汉江。赫金斯报道称，她在汉城以南的路上，看见南朝鲜傀儡“政府”的内政部长肩负着行囊逃命。
    【新华社平壤二日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社引共同社东京六月三十日讯：李承晚的“驻日代表团”宣布，李承晚因在军事上的惨败，业将伪“国防军”参谋总长蔡秉德免职。伪“国防军”总参谋长一职已由丁一权继任。丁一权原任伪“国防军”副参谋总长，曾于四月间赴美国“研究美国军事学”，但不到一个月即被李承晚召回，策划发动内战。
