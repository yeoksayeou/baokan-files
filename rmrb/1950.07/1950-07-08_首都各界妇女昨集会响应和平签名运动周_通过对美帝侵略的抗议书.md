She made a clear comparison of the living conditions of women and children in the world's two major camps. She said: Seeing the peaceful and happy lives of our brotherly countries in the world's peace and democracy camp has further increased our confidence in building a new China. The success of our construction will further guarantee world peace. Doing our job well in our respective positions is a practical action to defend world peace. If imperialism dares to provoke war, we will definitely have the strength to defeat it. The conference also unanimously adopted a letter of protest against US imperialist aggression.
