　　Beijing Electric Power Bureau Workers Pledge Eternal Brightness for the Capital
    Report Production Achievements to Chairman Mao
    Launch a Production Competition to Eliminate Accidents to Greet "August 1st"
    [Report from our newspaper] Correspondent Zhang Li reports: The Beijing Electric Power Bureau's third-quarter production task has already begun. In the past six months, thanks to the increased awareness of the workers, the display of initiative and creativity, and the implementation of democratic management, significant achievements have been made in the first and second quarter work. After overhauling the lines, approximately 3.3 million catties of millet were saved in the first and second quarters alone. The city's voltage has generally increased and gradually stabilized. The actual electricity sales reached more than 48.94 million kilowatt-hours. Currently, a production competition focused on eliminating and reducing accidents is being launched to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. All the workers of the bureau wrote a letter to Chairman Mao before "August 1st," reporting on their production achievements. The original text is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:
    On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day of our own people's army, we, all the workers, report our production situation to you with great excitement.
    Under the rule of the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang reactionaries, the power lines in the Beijing area had never undergone planned maintenance, so the losses on the lines were very high. The loss in 1949 was 27.6%. After the work in the first quarter of this year, it was reduced to 20.1%, and in the second quarter, it was 21.67%. Calculated on this basis, the reduction of more than 3.3 million kilowatt-hours of loss in these two quarters saved the people about 3.3 million catties of millet. Now, all the workers are striving to exceed the annual average of 23% set by the Ministry of Fuel Industry.
    The planned electricity sales for the first and second quarters was 47.8 million kilowatt-hours, and the actual electricity sales was more than 48.94 million kilowatt-hours, exceeding the target by more than 1.1 million kilowatt-hours, completing the task.
    In terms of quality, it has also been greatly improved. The city's voltage has generally increased and gradually stabilized. This will greatly help industrial production.
    In terms of fees, in the past, people were sent to the users to collect them. This was inconvenient for both the users and us. After careful study, fifteen fee collection stations were set up in the city, and users paid the fees themselves. This new system has been supported by all users, and as a result, the fee collection efficiency has been improved. In the past, only 60% to 70% of the current month's electricity bills were collected each month, but now it has reached more than 99%. The Dongzhimen station has collected 100% for three consecutive months, and no household at the Huashi Street station was late in paying in one month. The relationship between the citizens and us is extremely close. Moreover, due to the implementation of the new system, 8 to 9 billion yuan in cash was collected into the national treasury seven days earlier.
    We have been able to achieve these results due to the support and assistance of the citizens of the city, especially the specific cooperation of the comrades in the police stations of the Public Security Bureau. We believe that this assistance and cooperation will be further improved in the future.
    In the electricity industry, "accidents" are our biggest enemy, so in the third quarter, we will focus on eliminating and reducing accidents as the center of our work. Where it can be eliminated, it must be resolutely eliminated, and where it cannot be eliminated temporarily, it must be reduced as much as possible. To this end, a vigorous production competition has been launched in our bureau. The outside line workers are striving to complete the overhaul of the city's high-voltage lines in three or four months and overhaul all the low-voltage lines in the city within one year. The inside line workers are striving to complete the repair of the service lines of 110,000 users in the city within one year; the electrical workers guarantee to eliminate the 15 types of accidents that frequently occur in substations. Now, all the workers in the bureau are working hard to complete these tasks.
    The competition has started, and challenge letters and response letters are received every day. Many of us have already set production plans for individuals, trade union groups, or production units, and the first batch of collective contracts is about to be signed. Administrative work, trade union work, party work, and league work are all focused on the development and promotion of this movement. Under your leadership, we guarantee the eternal brightness of the capital.
    We still have many shortcomings in our work, and we believe that they will be gradually overcome under your leadership.
    Where there is the Communist Party, everything is full of hope!
    Finally, we wish you
    Good health!
                  Respectfully, all the workers of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau
                  July 29th

　　北京电业局职工保证首都永远光明
    向毛主席报告生产成绩     
    迎接“八一”展开消灭事故生产竞赛运动
    【本报讯】通讯员张立报道：北京电业局第三季生产任务已经开始。过去半年来，由于职工觉悟的提高，发挥了积极性与创造性，又实行了民主管理，在第一、二季工作中获得了很大成绩。检修线路后，第一、二两季就节省了约三百三十多万斤小米。全市电压普遍提高，并逐渐稳定。实际售电量达到了四千八百九十四万多度。现正为庆祝中国人民解放军“八一”建军节，展开了以消灭与减少事故为中心的生产竞赛运动。该局全体职工并于“八一”前夕，写信给毛主席，报告生产成绩，原文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在人民自己队伍“八一”建军节的前夕，我们全体职工以万分兴奋的心情向您报告一下我们的生产情况。
    在敌伪和国民党反动统治下北京区的电线从来没有过有计划的检修，所以线路上的损失是很大的，一九四九年的损失是百分之二七点六。经过今年第一季的工作，减到百分之二○点一，第二季是百分之二一点六七。以此计算，这两季减少损失三百三十余万度电，就给人民节省了约三百三十余万斤小米。现在全体职工正为超过燃料工业部所订全年平均的百分之二三而努力。
    第一、二季的部订售电量是四千七百八十万度，实际售电量是四千八百九十四万多度，超额一百一十多万度，完成了任务。
    在质的方面，也大大地提高了，全市电压已普遍提高，并逐渐稳定。这对于工业生产将有很大的帮助。
    收费方面，过去是派人到用户处去取。这对于用户及我们都不方便。经过仔细研究，在全市设立了十五个收费站，由用户交费。这一新的制度得到全体用户的拥护，因而收费效率提高了。过去每月只收入当月电费的百分之六○到七○，现在已达百分之九十九以上了。东直门站连续三个月收入百分之百，花市大街站一个月内没有一户迟交的。市民与我们的关系是极其密切的。又由于新制度的实行，使八、九十亿的现金提早了七天收归国库。
    我们能够有以上这些成绩，是由于全市市民的支持与协助，尤其是公安部门各派出所同志们工作的具体配合。我们相信，这些协助与配合，今后还会更进一步。
    在电业中，“事故”是我们最大的敌人，所以我们第三季把消灭事故与减少事故作为工作的重心，在可以消灭的地方要坚决地消灭它，暂时不能消灭的地方要尽量减少。为此，我们局内展开了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛运动，外线工人争取三、四个月内将全市高压线路整修完竣，一年内检修全市所有低压线路。内线工人争取一年内补修全市十一万用户的接户线工作；电气工人保证变电站消灭经常发生的十五种事故。现在，全局职工都为完成这些工作而努力。
    竞赛展开了，挑战书、应战书每天都有，我们很多已经订了个人、工会小组或生产单位的生产计划，第一批的集体合同就要签订。行政工作，工会工作，党的工作，团的工作都集中精力在这一运动的发展与推进上。我们在您的领导之下，保证首都的永远光明。
    我们工作中还有许多缺点，相信在您领导之下就会慢慢克服。
    有共产党的地方，一切就充满了希望！
    最后，祝您
    身体健康！
                  北京电业局全体职工敬礼  七月二十九日
