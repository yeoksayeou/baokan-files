　　(II) The Northeast Military Industry Bureau Should Not Suppress Criticism To the People's Daily:
    When I went to the Northeast, Comrade Wang Jie of the Northeast Military Industry Trade Union raised a question with me, namely, that the 90th issue of the Military Industry Newspaper, run by the Northeast Military Industry Trade Union, was ordered to be recalled by the Military Industry Bureau because it published several critical articles. The facts are as follows:
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," the number of critical articles received by the Military Industry Newspaper has increased. Comrade Wu Zhongkun of the Northeast Military Industry Trade Union working group, after learning about the serious waste caused by the carelessness and irresponsibility of cadres in Factory 52, wrote an article "Exposing the Serious Waste of Steel Materials in Factory 52." This article was reviewed and approved for publication by Le Shaohua, Director of the Military Industry Bureau. The 90th issue of the Military Industry Newspaper, published on May 16, published this article, and at the same time published three critical articles about the factory.
    After the newspaper was issued, the workers of the factory said: "The criticism is right! We should oppose waste." One director personally circled the article in red and posted it in the workshop to discuss it with the workers. At the Fourth Institute, workers voluntarily handed in more than 200 lathe tools in two hours. Some technicians said, "We should have criticized it long ago!"
    The factory convened a meeting of relevant cadres, and the responsible comrades all made self-criticisms. Only Director Tong Lei said that the working group's article exaggerated the numbers (which was not actually exaggerated), and that the four critical articles should not have been published on the front page. When the comrades of the working group and the reporters of the Military Industry Newspaper argued with him that these were all facts, Director Tong said, "It's useless to talk to you, you have to make a self-criticism anyway, you'll see!"
    At 6 p.m. that day, the Director of the Military Industry Bureau summoned Comrade Liu Qian, Minister of Culture and Education of the Military Industry Trade Union, and severely rebuked him, ordering the newspaper to be recalled, and believing that this was a blow to Factory 52. He also said, "What if the People's Daily publishes it as a model?"
    The day after the newspaper was recalled, many readers called to ask, "Why was it recalled?" The comrade in charge of communication work at Factory 52 said, "I will never dare to write critical articles again."
    From the above facts and reflections, since the articles published in the Military Industry Newspaper are all facts and have a good influence among the masses, the Military Industry Bureau's order to recall them has created a bad influence among the masses. Therefore, I believe that the Northeast Military Industry Bureau's practice violates the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications."
                 Liu Zijiu, Minister of Culture and Education Department, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, July 4th.
    People's Daily Editorial Department Note: We agree with Comrade Liu Zijiu's opinion. If the criticism published in the newspaper has shortcomings and errors, unless it seriously endangers the interests of the state and the people and has a particularly urgent nature, the method of recalling it should never be adopted, but the method of correction and counter-criticism should be adopted so that readers, editors, and critics can understand what the shortcomings of that criticism are. We believe that the Northeast "Military Industry Newspaper" has not committed any serious or urgent errors. If the newspaper's records are correct, it should not be recalled; if the newspaper's criticism does have places that do not conform to the facts and principles, corrections and counter-criticism should also be put forward, and it should not be recalled. The Northeast Military Industry Trade Union and the Military Industry Newspaper should of course respect the opinions of the Northeast Military Industry Bureau, but the Northeast Military Industry Bureau should also respect the Northeast Military Industry Trade Union and the Military Industry Newspaper, respect the opinions of the workers and their right to express their opinions. Therefore, the Military Industry Bureau's adoption of this abnormal and arbitrary action cannot be allowed. We hope that the person in charge of the Military Industry Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government will explain his opinion on this issue.

### （二）东北军工局不应当压制批评

　　（二）东北军工局不应当压制批评人民日报社：
    在我去东北时，东北军工总工会的王杰同志向我提出了一个问题，即东北军工总工会所办的军工报第九十期因为登了几篇批评性的稿件，被军工局命令将报纸收回的问题。事实的经过如下：
    自从党中央发布“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”之后，军工报所收到的批评性的稿件增加了。东北军工总工会的工作团吴钟琨同志，在了解了五二厂的由于干部粗心不负责而造成的严重浪费现象之后，即写了一篇“揭发五二厂钢料严重浪费”的稿件，该稿经军工局乐少华局长审阅同意发表。五月十六日出版的军工报第九十期就发表了这个稿件，并同时发表了关于该厂的三篇带有批评性的稿件。
    报纸发出后，该厂工友们说：“人家批评的对呀！我们应该反浪费。”有一位所长亲自将稿件用红笔圈出贴在工房内和工友一起检讨。四所在两点钟内工友自动交出车刀二百多把。有的技术人员说：“早就该批评了！”
    该厂召集有关干部开会，各负责同志均作了检讨。只有佟磊厂长说：工作团稿件夸大数字（实际并未夸大），四篇批评稿件不应登在一版。当工作团同志和军工报记者向他申辩说这都是事实时，佟厂长说：“和你们谈没有用，反正你们要作检讨，你们瞧着吧！”
    当天下午六点钟，军工局长又将军工总工会文教部长柳谦同志找去，大加申斥，勒令收回报纸，并认为这是对五二厂的打击。还说：“若叫人民日报当典型登了可怎么办？”
    报纸收回次日，很多读者电话问：“为什么要收回？”五二厂负责通讯工作的同志则说：“以后再不敢写批评稿件了。”
    从上述事实及反映看来，军工报上所发表的稿件，既然都是事实，且在群众中影响良好，而军工局勒令收回，是在群众中造成了不良影响。因此，我认为东北军工局这样作法是违犯中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”的。
                 中华全国总工会文教部部长  刘子久  七月四日
    人民日报编辑部按：我们同意刘子久同志的意见。报纸上刊登的批评如有缺点错误，除非是严重地危害国家和人民利益并带有特别紧急的性质，决不应当采取收回的办法，而应当采取更正和反批评的办法，以便使读者、编者、批评者了解那种批评的缺点何在。我们认为，东北《军工报》并没有犯什么严重的紧急的错误。如果该报记载并无错误，固然不应当收回；如果该报的批评确有不合事实不合原则的地方，也应当提出更正和反批评，而不应当收回。东北军工总工会和军工报当然应该尊重东北军工局的意见，但是东北军工局也应该尊重东北军工总工会和军工报，尊重工人群众的意见和他们发表意见的权利，因此，军工局采取这种不正常的专断的行动，是不能允许的。我们希望东北人民政府工业部军工局负责人对于这个问题说明他的意见。
