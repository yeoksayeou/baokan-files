　　Former Barefoot Farmer Now a Member of the Provincial Farmers' Association – Introducing Hunan Production Model Worker Zhang Zaitian
    Zhang Zaitian is 52 years old this year and is from the first village of Renhe Township, Haohe District, Xiangyin County, Hunan. His family has nineteen people, including himself, with seven laborers. They cultivate a total of thirty mu of land, of which only 3.5 mu are his own, 5 mu belonged to his deceased younger brother, and the remaining 21.5 mu are rented from landlords. The land his family cultivates is entirely in a waterlogged area. Last year, there was a major flood, and his fields were flooded. Fortunately, he planted early and harvested early, managing to salvage eighty-five *shi* of grain. However, after paying rent to the landlord and covering the costs of repairing farm tools, preparing seeds, and fertilizer, the family still lacked food for five months.

    How did he survive such a long period of scarcity? After the autumn harvest, Zhang Zaitian peddled miscellaneous goods, earning 3.2 *shi* of grain in over two months. His three older sons transported tiles to sell in Hubei, earning back about thirty *shi* of grain during the winter. The women in the family spun yarn and wove cloth, and the children collected manure for fertilizer, which also helped to cover some household expenses. In this way, he only lacked food for two months. But the problem of the spring famine was not completely solved. Last December, he harvested more than ten *shi* of cabbage from the fields, planted a thousand lettuce plants, and, with his grandsons, cleared a piece of wasteland of about one *mu*, planting four hundred bean plants, two hundred pumpkins, two patches of amaranth, six hundred potatoes, and five hundred cucumbers. On the ridges of the fields and in some open spaces, he also planted more than a thousand mung bean plants. This would solve the problem of food for a month or so. At the same time, thrift and frugality helped to basically resolve the spring famine problem.

    But Zhang Zaitian was still worried about missing the autumn harvest. This year, in the first month of the lunar calendar, he began soaking seeds and planted more than one *mu* of early-maturing rice ahead of time. At the time, most farmers said he was too rash and disagreed with him soaking the seeds so early. But he resolutely implemented his plan. In early March, his seedlings were transplanted into the fields. Through his hard work, fertilization, and cultivation, the seedlings grew very lushly, and they have now tasseled and are bearing fruit, to be harvested half a month earlier than ordinary rice. Therefore, he was able to survive both the spring and summer famines.

    In addition to his own hard work, Zhang Zaitian also helped others to produce and overcome the famine. He called on all the villagers to work hard on spring plowing and plant more early-maturing crops. After he finished transplanting his rice, he distributed the remaining early-maturing rice seedlings to those who needed them. Zhang Zaitian played a significant role in promoting production in the village, which enabled Renhe First Village to basically overcome the summer famine.

    On June 1st, the Hunan Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference opened. Zhang Zaitian attended the conference as a provincial production model worker and was elected as a member of the Provincial Farmers' Association. He said: "In the past, we barefoot farmers didn't even have the qualifications to attend such a large conference; even standing at the gate of the puppet county government, we would be scolded. Now, Chairman Mao has led us to turn ourselves around, enabling us to participate in the Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference and sit on the same bench with the chairman of the Provincial People's Government and talk." In the past, Zhang Zaitian was one of the thousands of oppressed and exploited farmers. Landlords forced the collection of high rents, and the puppet township chiefs extorted donations, with as much as six or seven *dou* being donated per *mu* of land. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the puppet township office often sent people to his home to conscript young men, disturbing the peace of his family. His family was extorted nearly two hundred *shi* of grain by the puppet township office, and the debts incurred as a result have not yet been paid off.

    He returned from Changsha on June 8th and went to the township farmers' association that afternoon to convey the resolutions passed by the Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference. He also discussed future work plans with everyone and decided to improve the organization of the farmers' associations, women's organizations, and youth organizations in the first and second villages of Renhe Township and complete the preparations for land reform after the autumn harvest.

　　过去的赤脚农民今天当了省农协委员
    ——湖南生产模范张在田介绍
    张在田今年五十二岁，是湖南湘阴县濠河区仁和乡第一村人。家里有十九个人，连他自己有七个劳动力。一共种三十亩田，自己只有田三亩五分，他死去的弟弟有五亩，其余的二十一亩五分田，都是佃种地主的。他家种的田完全是在渍水地带。去年大水，他的田被水淹了，幸好他种得早收得早，抢出了八十五石谷子，但除了给地主交租及修理农具、准备种籽肥料等费用，全家还差五个月的粮食。
    这么长的荒期，如何度过呢？张在田在秋收后挑杂货去卖，两个多月赚了三石二斗谷。三个大点的儿子贩运瓦货到湖北去卖，一冬赚回三十来石谷子。家里的妇女们纺纱织布，小孩拾粪集肥，多少也可以弥补一些家用。这样他只差两个月的粮食了。但春荒问题还没有完全解决。去年十二月他在田里收获了十几石白菜，种下了一千棵莴苣，还带孙子们开了一块亩把大的荒地，种上了四百棵豆角、二百棵南瓜、两块苋菜、六百棵洋芋，还有五百棵黄瓜。在田埂上及一些空地上，他还种下了千多棵绿豆。这样就可解决个把月的粮食。同时，省吃俭用，使春荒问题基本上得到了解决。
    但张在田还怕赶不上秋收。他在今年阴历正月就开始浸种，提早种了一亩多田的早熟稻。当时一般农民都说他太冒失，不同意他这么早就将谷种浸下。但是他仍坚决的按照计划实行。三月初，他的秧就插下了田，经他努力加工、施肥，禾苗长得非常茂盛，现已抽穗结实，较一般的稻子要早收半个月。因此，他的春荒、夏荒都能够度过了。
    张在田除了自己努力生产外，还帮助别人进行生产度荒。他号召全村农民努力春耕，多种早熟作物。他自己插完了田，剩下的早熟稻秧，都分送给了需要早稻秧的人。仁和一村所以能够基本上度过了夏荒，张在田在村里推动生产起了很大的作用。
    六月一日，湖南全省农民代表大会开幕，张在田以全省生产模范的资格参加了大会，并被选为省农协会委员。他说：“过去，我们打赤脚的农民，莫说参加咯（这样）大的会议，冒得（没有）资格；就是站在伪县政府的门口望一下，也要受到喝骂。现在，毛主席领导我们翻了身，使我们能够参加省农民代表大会，和省人民政府主席同坐在一条凳上谈话。”过去张在田也是千千万万受压迫受剥削的农民中的一个。地主要逼收高租，伪乡保长要勒收捐款，一亩田要捐到六七斗之多。在国民党反动派统治时期，伪乡公所时常派人来他家抓壮丁，闹得他家鸡犬不宁。他家被伪乡公所勒索了将近两百石谷子，因此欠下的账，至今还没有还清。
    他六月八日由长沙归来，当天下午就到乡农会去传达省农代会所通过的决议。并和大家一起研究今后的工作计划，决定将仁和乡一、二村的农协会以及妇女、青年等组织健全起来，完成秋后进行土地改革的准备工作。
