　　People's Government Leads the Masses to Overcome Natural Disasters
　　All Replanting Completed in Hail-Stricken Areas of Shanxi
　　[Our Newspaper] In Shanxi Province, the replanting and conversion of affected wheat and autumn fields in areas hit by hail in April and May have been basically completed. According to statistics, the hail disasters in these two months affected a total of 46 counties, 73 districts, and 1,686 villages, with a total loss of 2 million mu of wheat and autumn fields (including 1.2 million mu of autumn fields). The affected autumn fields needed to be replanted or converted, and the severely affected wheat fields also needed to be converted. After the disaster occurred, the masses in the affected areas initially showed pessimism and disappointment, and saboteurs and illegal societies took the opportunity to spread rumors and instigate trouble. Governments at all levels and the Communist Party committees at all levels took emergency measures to fully lead the masses to fight against the hail disaster. Through in-depth propaganda and mobilization, and using facts to expose reactionary rumors, the mood of the masses was reversed. The focus was on organizing and leading the work of rushing to replant and convert crops, specifically addressing the difficulties of the masses in terms of living conditions, seeds, fertilizers, and labor. In general, the summer and autumn fields in various disaster-stricken areas were planted on time without missing the farming season. In addition to sending Provincial Government members such as Zhi Yinglin to personally inspect and console the disaster areas and promote the leadership of various special and county leaders in organizing the masses to carry out replanting and conversion, the Provincial People's Government also allocated 400,000 catties of relief grain to help the masses solve the difficulties of getting through the lean period. Special districts, counties, and districts also transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside and distributed a considerable amount of seed loans and relief grain.
　　After the hail disaster in Changzhi Special District on May 25, the special district and county immediately organized more than 300 cadres to go to the disaster area to work, comfort the affected masses, and mobilize rush planting. For households with difficulties in planting, in addition to mobilizing mutual assistance, the government actively helped solve the difficulties. According to incomplete statistics, five counties including Lingchuan, Xiangyuan, and Tunliu distributed 64,000 catties of grain, and the Changzhi County and industrial and mining area banks loaned a total of 11.54 million yuan; cooperatives in Changzhi, Wuxiang, Lucheng, and Pingshun counties and cooperatives in nine villages solved 36,900 catties of seeds. The Wuxiang County Cooperative adjusted five shi of black beans to Weijialing, solving the fertilizer shortage for 26 households. In addition, mutual assistance measures were taken to adjust livestock power on the basis of administrative villages to solve the labor shortage. Xiangyuan Hezhang Village also paid attention to mobilizing women to participate in the rush planting work. After half a month of efforts, the replanting and conversion work in the entire area was successfully completed. Some disaster-stricken areas have begun to organize the masses to produce for self-salvation in order to prevent the summer famine. For example, Wuxiang Weijiazhuang organized ten households to refine saltpeter, and 30 households pre-paid foot money to the county government to haul bricks.
　　In Yuci Special District's Mengxian, Yangquan, Pingding and other places, the sowing, replanting and conversion of 300,000 mu of disaster-stricken summer and autumn fields was completed in just ten days. Among them, in Mengxian after the hail disaster, 30 county-level cadres personally went to the countryside, went deep into the disaster area to lead replanting and conversion, and allocated 10,000 catties of loan grain to solve the seed and fertilizer problems of the victims, and distributed 5,000 catties of relief grain to relieve the victims. The masses borrowed 17 shi and five dou of seeds from each other, solving the seed difficulties of 350 households. In this way, in just five days, 42,878 mu were converted and 55,240 mu were replanted, successfully completing the replanting task. Yuci County had basically completed replanting and conversion by June 2, and the second district, which was more severely affected, also completed the replanting and conversion work on June 6. After completing the task of replanting and converting 160,000 mu, Pingding organized the victims to carry out sideline production to solve the summer food problem. For example, Wangjiazhuang, Baoli and other villages in the Chengguan District organized more than 100 head of livestock and 40 laborers to transport coal, which could earn 1,000 catties of millet a day.
　　In the disaster-stricken areas of Xinxian, as of June 2, except for Nanguan, the drainage, replanting, and conversion work of more than 22,000 mu of disaster-stricken fields in the entire county was completed.

　　人民政府领导群众战胜天灾
    山西雹灾区全部补种完毕
    【本报讯】山西省于四、五两月遭受雹灾侵袭地区，受害麦田、秋田已基本完成补种、改种工作。据统计：两月内雹灾共殃及四十六个县、七十三个区、一千六百八十六个村，受损失麦田、秋田共达二百万亩（其中秋田一百二十万亩）。受害秋田需行改种，补种；麦田受害重者亦需改种。灾情发生后，各受灾地区，群众一度表现悲观失望，破坏分子及不法会道门乘机造谣煽惑。各级人民政府及中共各级党委均采取紧急措施，全力领导群众向雹灾斗争，经过深入宣传动员，用事实来揭穿反动谣言，扭转了群众的情绪，抓紧组织领导抢补改种工作，具体解决群众生活及种籽、肥料和劳畜力的困难，使各地受灾夏、秋田一般均做到不误农时，按时下种。省人民政府除派省府委员支应遴等亲赴灾区视察、慰问并推动各专、县领导组织群众进行补种改种外，复拨发救济粮四十万斤，帮助群众解决度荒困难。各专区、县、区亦均抽调大批干部下乡，并发放相当数量的种籽贷粮和救济粮。
    长治专区五月二十五日的雹灾发生后，专、县即组织了三百余干部，亲赴灾区工作，慰问受灾群众，发动抢种。对下种困难户，除发动互助互济外，政府并积极帮助解决困难。据不完全统计，陵川、襄垣、屯留等五县发粮六万四千斤，长治县和工矿区银行共贷款一千一百五十四万元；长治、武乡、潞城、平顺四县合作社及九个村合作社共解决种籽三万六千九百斤。武乡县社给魏家岭调剂黑豆五石，解决了二十六户的缺肥困难。此外又采取了互助办法，以行政村为单位调剂畜力，解决劳畜力困难。襄垣合漳村并注意了发动妇女参加抢补工作。经半月时间的努力，全区补种改种工作即胜利结束。部分受灾地区，为了预防夏荒，已开始组织群众生产自救。如武乡魏家庄组织十户群众进行熬硝，三十户预支脚价给县政府拉砖。
    榆次专区的盂县、阳泉、平定等地，仅十天时间即完成三十万亩受灾夏秋田的播种改种。其中盂县于雹灾后，县级三十个干部即亲自下乡，深入灾区领导补种改种，并拨贷粮一万斤，解决灾民籽种、肥料问题，发放救济粮五千斤救济灾民。群众互借籽种十七石五斗，解决了三百五十户籽种困难。这样仅在五天内即改种四万二千八百七十八亩，补种五万五千二百四十亩，胜利完成了补改任务。榆次县六月二日即大体补改完毕，灾情较重的第二区，亦于六月六日完成补种改种工作。平定于完成十六万亩的补种改种任务后，即组织灾民进行副业生产，解决夏季口粮问题。如城关区王家庄，瀑里等村，组织了一百余头牲口，四十个劳力贩运煤，一天即可收入小米一千斤。
    忻县受灾地区，至六月二日，除南关外，全县二万二千余亩灾田的排水、补种、改种等工作全部完成。
