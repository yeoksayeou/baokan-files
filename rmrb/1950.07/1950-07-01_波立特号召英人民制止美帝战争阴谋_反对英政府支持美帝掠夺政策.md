Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th -- Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, published a special article in the London Daily Worker on the 28th, stating: President Truman's decision to organize the most direct armed intervention against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the savage bombing of Korean villages and towns, finally proves that the whole situation was caused by the premeditated provocation, preparation, and organization of the South Korean reactionary forces to launch a civil war against the People's Government of North Korea.
    The fact that this attack by South Korea was launched immediately after Dulles' visit to South Korea proves to everyone who uses their brain that the sinister military measures that President Truman is currently implementing illegally were prepared long ago.
    United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie should immediately convene a full Security Council meeting with representatives of the People's Republic of China present. Unless such a meeting is convened, any decision made by the Security Council manipulated by the United States without the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China will be an arbitrary action and will have no legal effect.
    But the American imperialists want war, and they are seeking any excuse to drag all the countries it considers to be tied to its war machine into this war. That is why this carefully prepared Korean incident is also being used as an excuse for a direct threat to China, ordering the US Seventh Fleet to armed annexation of Taiwan, and increasing the supply of weapons to France and Indochina. Unless all peace-loving countries resolutely stop it, these crazy war decisions will threaten the whole world with war.
    The British people must reject Attlee's statement and, under no circumstances, allow themselves or their government to join the United States' plans in the Far East directly or indirectly. British power must only be used in the direction of peace.
    The cry of "Do not interfere in Korea" will surely resonate throughout Britain and must awaken the people to ensure that the Labour government does not give any form of support to the United States' imperialist plunder policy.
    The British people have a responsibility to make this clear to the United States, and at the same time, to demand the full use of the legitimate institutions of the United Nations and its full Security Council to ensure a peaceful settlement. The people should insist that these war measures by the United States must be stopped immediately.
    Do not interfere in Korea! Do not interfere in China! Britain should not contribute a penny, a person, a gun, a ship, or an airplane to assist the American millionaires' plans for a war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China!

　　波立特号召英人民制止美帝战争阴谋
    反对英政府支持美帝掠夺政策
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】英国共产党总书记波立特二十八日在敦伦工人日报上发表专文称：杜鲁门总统决定对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国组织最直接的武装干涉，和对朝鲜村镇的狂暴轰炸，最后地证明了：整个局势是因为南朝鲜反动势力的预先挑拨、准备和组织，要对北朝鲜的人民政府发动内战而引起的。
    这次南朝鲜的攻击紧随着杜勒斯访问南朝鲜之后而发动，这一事实就向一切用脑子的人证明了：杜鲁门总统目前非法地执行的罪恶军事措施，是老早就准备好了的。
    联合国秘书长赖伊应立即召开有中华人民共和国代表出席的安理会全体会议。除非这样的会议召开了，否则由美国操纵而没有苏联和中华人民共和国参与的安理会所作的任何决定，都是专断的行动，是没有法律效力的。
    但是美国帝国主义者想要战争，他们寻求着任何借口，要把一切它认为已系在自己战车上的国家卷入此种战争中。这就是为什么这次谨慎地准备的朝鲜事件，也被用来作为对中国直接威胁的借口，他们对美国第七舰队下了命令，要武装吞并台湾，并增加供给法国和印度支那的武器。除非一切渴望和平的国家坚决予以制止，这些疯狂的战争决定，便会使全世界遭受战争的威胁。
    英国人民必须拒绝艾德礼的声明，并且，不论在任何情况下，都不要让他们自己或他们的政府直接或间接地加入美国在远东的计划。英国的力量必须只用之于和平方向。
    “不要干涉朝鲜”的呼声，必定会在全英国得到反响，并且必须唤醒人民，确保不使工党政府给予美国的帝国主义掠夺政策以任何形式的支持。
    英国人民有责任向美国说明这一点，同时，要求充分使用联合国的合法机构及其安全理事会全体会议，以保证获致和平解决。人民应当坚持：美国的这些战争措施必须立即予以制止。
    不要干涉朝鲜！不要干涉中国！英国不要拿一文钱、一个人、一支枪、一只船或一架飞机，去协助美国的百万富翁针对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及中国的侵略战争计划！
