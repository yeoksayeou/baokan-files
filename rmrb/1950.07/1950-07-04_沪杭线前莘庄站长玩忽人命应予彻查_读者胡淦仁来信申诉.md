　　Thorough Investigation Should Be Made into the Case of Qianxinzhuang Station Master on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Neglecting Human Life
　　Reader Hu Ganren's Letter of Appeal
　　Comrade Editor:
　　My family has lived in Xinzhuang Town (18 kilometers from Shanghai) on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line for generations. On December 28, 1949, my wife, Mei Jue, because her younger brother's wedding and her cousin's wedding were approaching, and also because she was seven months pregnant, returned to her mother's home in Dipu, Anji, Zhejiang. I also accompanied her. The train we were waiting for was the No. 117 down train at 8:39 PM. Because the train was delayed, it stopped at the platform for less than two minutes before departing (the usual stop time is ten minutes). Anticipating that we would not be able to board before the train started, I asked my wife to request Station Master Gu Runlin to delay the departure slightly so that my brother-in-law and I could pass the luggage. My wife returned and said that she had obtained Station Master's permission. My brother-in-law then helped my wife board the train, and I helped pull her up at the door. Just as my wife placed one foot on the steps, the station master waved the green flag to release the train. The train suddenly started, and my wife was unexpectedly jolted and fell onto the platform. I shouted for help, and the passengers in the carriage also shouted frantically about the accident. However, the station master ignored it and did not provide assistance, which led to my beloved wife's tragic death. This kind of incident of neglecting passenger lives has occurred three times in the week since the station master took office. The people of Xinzhuang now regard taking the train as a dangerous ordeal. Although the Railway Bureau once sent personnel to investigate the matter, they downplayed the seriousness of the incident, letting it fade away without resolution. The offending station master, Gu Runlin, was transferred from the third-class station master of Xinzhuang to the second-class station master of Wangdian Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. I have truthfully appealed to the Xinzhuang local government, the Shanghai Military Control Commission, and the Shanghai Railway Administration. I received a reply from the Military Control Commission stating that it had been forwarded to the Shanghai People's Court for handling. However, it has been half a year and there has been no appropriate resolution. I hope that the comrade editor will publish this letter so that the relevant authorities can promptly handle this matter.

　　沪杭线前莘庄站长玩忽人命应予彻查
    读者胡淦仁来信申诉编辑同志：
    我家世居沪杭线莘庄镇（距上海十八公里）。一九四九年十二月二十八日，我妻梅珏因其胞弟婚期及堂妹嫁期临近，兼以怀孕七月，故返浙江安吉娘家递铺。当时我亦偕行。我们等候的车次是晚八时三十九分一一七次下行客车。因该次列车误点，停靠月台不及两分钟，即行开出（一般停车时间为十分）。预计在开车前不克登车，我嘱妻向站长顾润林请求稍缓放车，我与内兄传递行李。妻回来时称：已得站长面允。当即由内兄扶妻上车，我在车门帮拉。我妻一足刚踏上门梯，该站长即扬绿灯放车。列车猛然开动，我妻骤遭意外震撼，跌落在月台上。我大声呼救，车厢旅客亦群起狂唤肇祸。但该站长置之不理，以致我的爱妻惨遭非命。该站长距离我们上车处仅十公尺，亦不施救。这种玩忽旅客生命的事件，在该站长任职以来的一星期中，接连发生了三起。莘地群众乃视乘车为畏途。路局为此虽曾一度派员莅场调查，但大事化小、小事化无、不了了之。而肇祸站长顾润林则由莘庄三等站站长调为沪杭路王店站二等站站长。我曾据实向莘庄地方政府、上海市军管会及上海铁路管理局申诉。并奉军管会批复，说已转上海人民法院处理。但距今已半年，尚无适当处置。望编辑同志把这封信发表，使有关方面从速处理这一事件。
