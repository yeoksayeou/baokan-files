The Evil Consequences of Coercive Orders
Lingshou's Ban on Opera Performances Causes Major Dispute

To the Editor:

I am reporting to you a typical example of coercive orders. Moreover, this matter has not yet been resolved. The matter is very simple, just a village performing old operas, but because the county and district cadres used coercive methods, it resulted in a great deal of trouble.

In early May (March 12th of the lunar calendar), the villages of Siling, Nanying, and Beiying in the Second District of Lingshou, Hebei, hired an old opera troupe from Bushu Village in Fuping, paying nine shi of corn, planning to perform in Siling Village. Before hiring the troupe, Cao Qinggui, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee, had instructed the Second District: Old operas are not allowed, and they should be stopped as soon as possible. Therefore, the Second District Committee immediately ordered the three villages to cancel the engagement, but the villages ignored it. On the day the troupe arrived, Ma Jingkai, a liaison officer of the County Committee, said to the district cadres: "The County Committee will definitely not allow the performance, and the district is responsible for stopping it. The instruction letter will come later!" Li Yuwen and Li Zhong, propaganda committee members of the District Committee, immediately went to Siling, but to no avail. On the first day of the performance, Liu Yinfu, the district head, went to the performance site and announced: "Before the county agrees, performances are not allowed!" He took the village cadres and Liu Shitou, who initiated the hiring of the troupe, to the district to await instructions from the county. But the instructions did not arrive, and the opera began.

After the opera started, County Magistrate Yin Donglai told District Head Liu of the Second District on the phone: "Siling is willing to use nine shi of corn to hire an old opera troupe, which proves that the masses are not suffering. The 10,000 jin of relief grain can be temporarily suspended, and you should mobilize the disaster-stricken people in the entire Second District to oppose Siling's performance." He also said, "It is definite that performances are not allowed, but armed conflict must be avoided." That afternoon, District Head Liu and the village cadres returned to the village and announced the county magistrate's instructions. In the middle of a lively performance, the opera was stopped. The audience shouted, "Start the opera!" District Head Liu went on stage and said: "If you want to perform, the relief grain will be stopped! Do you want relief grain or do you want to see the opera?!" The masses were silent. He then said to the head of the troupe: "Without the permission of the local government, you should not perform. If you perform, no one will guarantee the payment!"

On the morning of the 14th, village cadres and masses from Nanying and Beiying elected Liu Shitou and three others as representatives to go with the district cadres to the district for interrogation. Liu Shitou admitted in the district that he took the initiative to hire the troupe, and seven others agreed. The four of them were detained for a day and a night. On the afternoon of the 14th, Fu Yimei, secretary of the district government, and six other cadres went to Siling to stop the performance, asking the masses: "Who dares to be responsible for the performance?" Six people successively jumped onto the stage. Secretary Fu, seeing the situation was not right, stopped asking. The six people were immediately arrested. They were released that same day.

The next morning, District Head Liu, under the pretext of holding a meeting to discuss the distribution of disaster relief grain, summoned more than forty village cadres and representatives from the three villages of Siling, Nanying, and Beiying to the district. While gathering people, they ran into a village cadre who was delivering oil to a grocery store. He was mistaken for buying lamp oil for the troupe, and the oil was confiscated on the spot. After these people were taken to the district, they were forced to sign a pledge with the conditions: stop the opera upon return; guarantee no payment for the opera; guarantee that the refugees have food to eat. After Liu Shitou returned to the village, he said to the opera-goers: "We dare not take responsibility anymore. Whoever dares to take responsibility, let them perform." An old man named Wu Deman said on the spot: "I'll take responsibility! I've lived sixty years, can I live another sixty!" So the opera started again.

On the 16th, District Head Liu heard that the troupe was going to "present" an extra day of performance before leaving, so he asked County Magistrate Yin again. County Magistrate Yin replied: "If they insist on performing, call the head of the troupe to the county!" That afternoon, District Head Liu and four cadres went to Siling and tied up Liu Jingui, the deputy head of the troupe, and took him to the district. More than thirty actors from the Bushu opera troupe, upon hearing the news, rushed to the district yelling and demanding the release of the person, and some even carried wooden sticks. District Head Liu, seeing the situation was not good, hid on the roof of the east courtyard, and ordered other cadres to gather a few militiamen to monitor secretly. He even ordered the actors to be tied up several times. The actors could not find the district head, and after persuasion from cadres such as the district financial assistant, Liu Jingui was released, and the actors were willing to go back. As soon as the actors left, District Head Liu immediately sent letters to the three villages, ordering them to detain the troupe's props, suspend payment for the opera, and detain the head of the troupe. He also planned to send militiamen to chase them and prevent them from leaving the area.

At this time, the county, seeing the seriousness of the matter, sent Comrade Ma from the County Committee to resolve it. Cadres and masses from the three villages reported to Comrade Ma about District Head Liu's coercive style and requested the withdrawal of the pledges they had made to the district head. Comrade Ma immediately announced that the pledges made under duress were invalid, the relief grain would be distributed as usual, and the confiscated oil would be returned to its owner. He also criticized the bureaucratic and commandist style of the county and district leaders. At the same time, he pointed out that it was also wrong for the three villages to perform old operas during the busy farming season, delaying production, and for the village cadres to follow the masses blindly. Subsequently, a meeting of key district-level cadres was held in the Second District to help the district cadres make self-criticisms. However, District Head Liu, apart from reluctantly admitting that tying people up was wrong, was still unwilling to reflect deeply. Later, he was transferred to the county to make a written self-criticism, which was also extremely superficial. The County Committee is also divided on this issue, which has led to the matter remaining unresolved to this day. Editor, can this kind of work style be allowed?

Zhang Zihui

Editor's Note: The example of Lingshou County's ban on old opera performances fully illustrates the serious harm of the commandist style. Originally, under the circumstances of busy farming season and disaster, it was not a bad thing for the county magistrate to advocate not performing operas. Moreover, such a proposition, as long as it is explained clearly to the masses, will be sympathetically received by the masses. However, County Magistrate Yin Donglai and District Head Liu Yinfu did not adopt the method of persuasion and education, but completely adopted the method of coercive orders. Because it was a coercive order, it was not easily accepted by the masses, so they abused their power, arbitrarily arrested people, and arbitrarily used the militia, which made things worse and worse. This caused the people's government to be at odds with the people. This is meaningless. A lesson can be learned from this: using coercive orders on the people instead of persuasion and education will ruin everything good. The Lingshou County Committee should draw a conclusion on this, educate party members and cadres, and call on everyone to earnestly oppose the commandist style.

### 强迫命令的恶果  灵寿制止演戏引起大纠纷

　　强迫命令的恶果
    灵寿制止演戏引起大纠纷编辑同志：
    我向你报告一个强迫命令的典型例子。而且这件事还没有得到解决。事情很简单，不过是村里唱旧戏，但是由于县区干部使用强迫命令的方法，结果闹出了一大堆的乱子。
    五月初（阴历三月十二日），河北灵寿二区寺岭、南营、北营三村从阜平部落树村接来一台旧戏，戏价玉蜀黍九市石，准备在寺岭村开演。接戏以前，县委宣传部副部长曹庆贵曾指示二区说：不准唱旧戏，要早些制止。于是二区区委即指令三村退戏，但村里没理睬。戏接来那天，县委会交通员马景凯对区干部说：“县委肯定不准唱，叫区里负责制止。指示信随后就会来！”区委宣传委员李玉文、李忠当下就去了寺岭一趟，也没有结果。开戏的第一天，区长刘银福亲往唱戏地点，宣布：“在县里同意前，不准开戏！”并带村干部和出头请戏的刘石头到区听候县里指示。但指示未拿来，戏就开演了。
    戏开演以后，县长尹东来在电话里告诉二区刘区长：“寺岭肯用九石玉米请旧戏，就证明群众生活不苦，一万斤救济粮即可暂时停发，你们应动员全二区灾民反对寺岭唱戏。”并说“不准唱是肯定的，但要避免武装冲突。”当天下午，刘区长和村干部回村，宣布县长的指示。正唱得热闹当中，戏被煞住了。台下就乱喊“开戏！”刘区长登上戏台说：“要唱戏就停发救济粮！你们是要救济粮呢？还是要看戏？！”群众都不哼气。他随后对剧团负责人说：“没经当地政府准许，你们不要唱。唱了，没人保障戏价！”
    十四日早晨，戏继续唱。南北营村干部、群众推举刘石头等四人作代表随区干部到区受讯。刘石头在区里承认戏是他主动接的，另外七个人同意。他们四人被拘押了一天一夜。十四日下午，区公所秘书傅亿梅等六个干部，又去寺岭制止唱戏，责问群众：“谁敢负责唱戏？”台下相继跳上去六个人。傅秘书见势头不对，不再问了。随即将这六个人逮捕起来。当天就释放了。
    第二天清晨，刘区长以开会讨论分配救灾粮为名，把寺岭、南营、北营三个村的四十多个村干部及代表找到区里。正集合人时，碰见给果子铺送油的一个村干部，他被误认为给剧团买点灯油，当场将油没收。这许多人被带到区上以后，即被迫立字具结，条件是：回去就停戏；保证不出戏价；保证难民有吃的。刘石头回村后，对看戏的群众说：“我们再也不敢负责任了，谁敢负责任谁就唱”。当场有个叫吴德满的老头说：“我负责！活了六十了，还能活六十吗！”于是戏就又唱了起来。
    十六日，刘区长听说剧团临走要“奉送”一天戏，就又请示尹县长。尹县长答复：“非要唱，就叫剧团的负责人到县里来！”当天下午，刘区长和四个干部即到寺岭，把剧团副团长刘金贵捆起来带到区里。部落树剧团三十多个演员闻讯，就赶到区里喊骂要人，有的人还拿着木棍子。刘区长见势头不好，就躲到东院房上，让其它干部集合了几个民兵暗中监视。还几次下命令捆演员。演员们找不到区长，又经区财政助理员等干部劝说，释放了刘金贵，演员们才肯回去。演员刚走，刘区长马上给该三个村去信，命令扣留剧团的道具，并停发戏价，扣留戏团负责人。还计划派民兵追赶，不让他们出境。
    这时县里见事态严重，才派县委马同志前往解决。三个村的干部、群众纷纷向马同志反映刘区长的强迫命令作风，并要求撤回给区长立的字据。马同志当下就宣布被迫所立字据失效，救济粮照发，没收的油归还原主。并批评了县、区领导上的官僚主义、命令主义作风，同时也指出三个村在农忙时唱旧戏，耽误生产，村干部作群众尾巴也是不对的。随后，又到二区召开区级主要干部会议，帮助区干部作检讨。但刘区长除勉强承认捆人不对外，仍不肯深入反省。后来调他到县作书面检讨，也极不深刻。县委会内部对此也不一致，以致拖到现在还没解决。编辑同志：这种作风能够允许吗？
                                           张稚桧
    编者按：灵寿县禁止演旧戏的例子，充分说明强迫命令作风为害之严重。本来，在农忙又有灾情的情况下，县长主张不演戏并不是坏事。而且这样的主张，只要向群众讲清楚，群众也是会同情的。但是，县长尹东来、区长刘银福却没有采用说服教育的方法，完全采用强迫命令的方法。因为是强迫命令，群众不容易接受，于是就滥用职权，随便捕人，随便使用民兵，以致事情愈弄愈大。使那里的人民的政权与人民对立起来。这是毫无意义的。从这里可以得到一个教训，凡是对人民用强迫命令的方法，而不是用说服教育的方法，一切好事情都会办坏的。灵寿县委应当对此作出结论，教育党员与干部，要大家来认真反对强迫命令的作风。
