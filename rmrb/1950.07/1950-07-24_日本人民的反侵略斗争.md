　　The Japanese People's Anti-Aggression Struggle
    Lin Tianmo
    The people of the whole world are opposing the U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The people of Japan, under the occupation of the U.S. military, are not completely silent either. The brutal rule of MacArthur and Yoshida cannot suppress the anger of the Japanese people.
    The Japanese people's anti-aggression struggle is, on the one hand, a link in the worldwide struggle against aggression and for peace; on the other hand, it has its own special position and significance. Because the current war of aggression waged by U.S. imperialism takes Japan as its main base. Japan has become a complete colony and military base of U.S. imperialism, and the fate of the Japanese people is being driven by MacArthur and Yoshida to the brink of serving as cannon fodder.
    Japan is now: the headquarters from which U.S. imperialism commands the war of aggression, and the supply depot for deploying troops and transporting military supplies. After the outbreak of the war of aggression, war-mongering bosses came to the East one after another to deploy operations. MacArthur, responsible for directing the war of aggression, deployed troops and issued orders; Tokyo has become virtually the headquarters for the war of aggression. At the same time, the airfields, naval ports, and military highways that U.S. imperialism had pre-built in Japan have been officially put into the service of the war. Batch after batch of air force, navy, and army personnel, and large quantities of aircraft, tanks, artillery, and various military supplies are being dispatched from Japan to Korea. Even troops and military supplies transferred from within the United States are being dispatched and distributed through Japanese ports. Most of Japan's ships have been supplied for military use, and Japanese munitions factories are stepping up the manufacture of weapons of murder. What is particularly noteworthy is that due to the failures of the U.S. invading forces in the Korean War, the replenishment of cannon fodder is extremely urgent. Using Japanese people as cannon fodder in the war of aggression was already in the plans of U.S. imperialism. On July 8, MacArthur ordered the traitorous Yoshida government to expand the number and equipment of the Japanese police, which was an open step to organize Japanese armed forces. At present, due to the constraints of the international situation and concerns about the nationalistic sentiments of the Japanese people, U.S. imperialism still does not dare to openly and boldly organize the Japanese army on a large scale to participate in the war of aggression against Korea and Taiwan. However, when the time comes, it is clearly possible for U.S. imperialism to drive the Japanese army to the battlefield of aggression. Recently, the Korean People's Army has found the bodies of Japanese soldiers on the battlefield and Japanese soldiers in the prisoner-of-war camps, proving that the U.S. imperialists have been using Japanese people as supplemental cannon fodder in a scattered and mixed manner. It has also become an open secret that U.S. imperialism is instigating Japanese old soldiers to organize so-called "volunteer armies" and the like to prepare to obstruct the liberation of Taiwan.
    Japan's territory is being used as a military base for U.S. imperialist war of aggression, Japan's wealth is being used as a military consumption for U.S. imperialist war of aggression, and the Japanese people are being used as a source of cannon fodder for U.S. imperialist war of aggression. However, although this group of traitors, such as Yoshida, are willing to serve U.S. imperialism in a slavish manner, selling out the country and betraying the people, the Japanese people are determined not to agree to do so. No matter how severely and cruelly MacArthur and Yoshida use means of suppression, the Japanese people's struggle against aggression and for national liberation is developing day by day, the peace signature movement is being widely promoted in Japan, and the call for independence from war is penetrating all levels of the Japanese people. MacArthur and Yoshida have to worry about the "security" problems of this base.
    We cherish the strength contributed by the Japanese people in the world's struggle against aggression and for peace, and we sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people under the clutches of imperialism and traitors. The Japanese people's struggle against aggression and for peace is inseparable from their own national liberation struggle. Opposing U.S. imperialism's use of Japan as a base for aggression against Taiwan and Korea is also helping the Japanese people to strive for independence, freedom, and liberation. Similarly, the Japanese people's response to the world's people's movement against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea is also for their own sake to strive for independence, freedom, and liberation.
    The Chinese people have driven U.S. imperialism out of the mainland and will continue to drive it out of Taiwan. The Korean people have given U.S. imperialism a head-on blow. The Japanese people are also fighting U.S. imperialism strongly. U.S. imperialism must be repelled and even completely driven out. The Chinese people, the Korean people, the Japanese people, as well as the Vietnamese and Filipino people, have risen up one after another to oppose imperialist aggression, guaranteeing that they will be able to defeat imperialism.

　　日本人民的反侵略斗争
    林天摩
    全世界人民都反对着美国帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜。美军占领下的日本的人民也不是完全沉默的。麦克阿瑟、吉田们的凶暴统治，压不住日本人民的愤怒。
    日本人民的反侵略斗争，一方面是世界性的反对侵略争取和平的斗争中的一环；另一方面还有其特殊的立场和意义。因为，目前美国帝国主义所进行的侵略战，就以日本为主要基地。日本已经成为美国帝国主义十足的殖民地和军事基地，日本人民的命运，正被麦克阿瑟和吉田们驱迫到充当炮灰的境地的边缘。
    日本现在是：美国帝国主义指挥侵略战的司令部，出动军队和输送军火的兵站。侵略战展开后，战贩头子纷纷到东方来，部署作战。麦克阿瑟负指挥侵略战的责任调兵遣将，发号施令；东京俨然成了侵略战争的大本营。同时，过去美国帝国主义在日本预先建立好的飞机场、军港和军用公路等，已经正式为战争服务。一批批的空军、海军和陆军，大量的飞机、坦克车、大炮以及各种军用物资，都从日本派送到朝鲜去。连从美国国内调来的军队和军需品，也都经由日本口岸调度配发。日本的船只多已供给军用，日本的军火工厂在加紧制造杀人武器。再尤其可注意的是由于美国侵略部队在朝鲜作战的失利，炮灰的补充极为迫切。利用日本人充当侵略战的炮灰，早在美国帝国主义的计划里面。七月八日麦克阿瑟命令吉田卖国政府扩充日本警察的数量和配备，就是要组织日本武装部队的公开步骤。目前由于受国际情势的牵制，以及对日本人的民族主义情绪的顾虑，美国帝国主义虽还不敢公然放胆大规模组织日本军队参加对朝鲜和台湾的侵略战，但等到时间到来，美帝驱迫日本军队于侵略战场，显然是可能的。最近朝鲜人民军已在战场上发现过日本兵的尸体，在俘虏群中发现过日本兵，证明美帝已以分散渗杂的方式，利用日本人作补充炮灰了。美国帝国主义嗾使日本旧军人组织所谓“义勇军”之类准备阻挠台湾的解放，也已成了公开的秘密。
    日本的国土被充作美国帝国主义侵略战的军事基地，日本的财物被充作美国帝国主义侵略战的军事消耗，日本人民被充作美国帝国主义侵略战的炮灰来源。可是，吉田等这一批卖国贼尽管甘心奴颜婢膝地替美帝服役，出卖国土，出卖人民；日本人民却坚决不答应这么干。不管麦克阿瑟和吉田用如何严厉残酷的手段从事镇压，日本人民反侵略，争民族解放的斗争，还是日益发展，和平签名运动正在日本广泛推进，反战争独立的号召正在深入日本人民的各阶层，麦克阿瑟和吉田对于这个基地的“治安”问题是不得不发急的。
    我们珍视日本人民在世界反对侵略、争取和平的斗争中所供献的力量，我们同情日本人民在帝国主义和卖国贼的魔手下的遭遇。日本人民的反对侵略、争取和平的斗争，是与其本身的民族解放斗争分不开的。反对美国帝国主义把日本当做侵略台湾朝鲜的基地，也就是帮助日本人民争取独立、自由与解放。同样，日本人民响应世界人民反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜运动，也就是为其自身争取独立、自由与解放。
    中国人民已经把美国帝国主义逐出于大陆，将继续把它逐出于台湾，朝鲜人民使美国帝国主义受到了迎头痛击；日本人民也在跟美国帝国主义作坚强的斗争。美国帝国主义一定要被击退，以至完全驱逐出去。中国人民、朝鲜人民、日本人民、以及越南、菲律宾人民，已经纷纷起来反对帝国主义的侵略，保证必然能够击败帝国主义。
