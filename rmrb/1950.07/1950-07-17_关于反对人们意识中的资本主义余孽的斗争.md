　　On the Struggle Against the Remnants of Capitalism in People's Minds
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Moscow]: *Pravda* reader and soldier Nikolayev asked a question: "What are the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, and how can they be overcome?" *Pravda* published an article answering this question on June 11th, entitled "On the Struggle Against the Remnants of Capitalism in People's Minds." The full text is as follows:
    Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people have established a socialist society and are now advancing smoothly towards communism. At present, the communist education of workers is a work of decisive significance.
    As a result of the victory of socialism in our country, the uniquely dominant position of socialist ownership of the means of production has been established, and so has the socialist economic system. The vast majority of the Soviet population is directly connected with socialist production. The material welfare of the workers in our country depends on the growth of social production and the economic strength of the Soviet state.
    The commonality of interests and purposes in the struggle to build a communist society unites all the Soviet people. New and powerful driving forces for our development—the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, the friendship of the Soviet nationalities, and Soviet patriotism—have unfolded on the basis of victorious socialism.
    The victory of socialism has fundamentally changed the social existence of the Soviet people. The Bolshevik Party, which leads the great construction activities of our people, has shaped a new spiritual outlook for the Soviet people through enormous educational and ideological work. The vast majority of workers in our country are now conscious and active builders of communism. The people and communism have merged together in our country.
    However, in the minds of some workers, there are still old habits, traditions, and prejudices that have been left over from capitalist society, and they hinder our progress.
    So, what are the reasons for the survival of capitalist remnants in people's minds?
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that social consciousness is determined by social existence. The material conditions of social life, social existence, change first, and then people's consciousness, views, preferences, and habits change accordingly. Furthermore, the process of changing consciousness always lags behind the process of changing social existence, and cannot keep up with the development of the material foundation of social life. Therefore, old views, concepts, etc., continue to play a role, either for a long time or temporarily.
    When pointing out the characteristics of the future communist society in the "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx wrote that the first stage of communism—the socialist stage—still preserves the "birthmarks" of the old society, and socialism is produced from within the old society. The views, concepts, and habits left over from capitalist society are this kind of "birthmark." The remnants of capitalism in people's minds have no basis in the Soviet system, and these remnants are irrelevant to the Soviet system.
    Lenin and Stalin have repeatedly emphasized that when establishing a new, socialist life, people cannot get rid of the weaknesses and shortcomings left over from the exploiting society all at once. Lenin pointed out: The force of habit of millions is the most terrible force. In order to completely overcome the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, the Party and the state need to carry out long-term and systematic work on the communist education of workers.
    The capitalist encirclement hostile to us, in the struggle against the Soviet state, tries every possible way to support and utilize the remnants of capitalism in the minds of some Soviet people.
    Comrade Stalin instructed us: "...Although capitalism has been eliminated in the economy, the remnants of bourgeois views are still preserved in people's minds, and will continue to be preserved in the future. In addition, it should be taken into account that the capitalist encirclement, which we should always guard against, is trying to revive and support these remnants." (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, p. 307)
    The imperialist bourgeoisie attempts to revive and support the remnants of capitalism in the minds of the Soviet people by various methods and means, in order to prevent the development of Soviet society towards communism, and in order to undermine the power of the socialist state.
    The Communist Party is waging a ruthless struggle against all expressions of bourgeois ideology, and is educating the Soviet people with Marxism-Leninism, Soviet patriotism, and a high degree of revolutionary vigilance.
    Bourgeois society, based on the dominance of private ownership and the exploitation of man by man, provokes the lowest instincts among people.
    Lenin said: "The old society was based on the principle that either you rob others, or others rob you; either you work for others, or others work for you; either you are a slave owner, or you are a slave." (Collected Works, Volume 30, p. 412)
    In socialist society, the exploitation of man by man has been eliminated, and the possibility of some people profiting from the labor of others has disappeared. The socialist principle established by law in the Stalin Constitution is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and "he who does not work, neither shall he eat." The vast majority of Soviet workers work honestly and selflessly, fully understanding their social obligations to the motherland and the socialist state. The Soviet people do not work for the exploiters, but for themselves, for their Soviet society. When labor is despised and becomes a heavy burden in capitalist countries, in the Soviet Union, labor becomes a glorious, courageous, and heroic cause. The nationwide socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement are clear manifestations of the new attitude of the Soviet people towards labor.
    In contrast to the ideas of bourgeois individualism, the fundamental characteristic of the worldview of the Soviet people is collectivism, which is based on the comradeship and socialist mutual assistance of the workers liberated from exploitation. The Soviet people are convinced by their own experience that only socialist society creates all the conditions for a prosperous and civilized life, and for the full development of the talents and abilities of the workers.
    A conscious attitude towards labor is a prominent feature of the Soviet people. However, we also have backward people who undermine socialist labor discipline, do not take a sincere attitude towards fulfilling state tasks, and in industrial enterprises, institutions, and agricultural production, there are still laggards, lazy people, producers of defective products, and those who seek only profit.
    People who do not work sincerely, people who allow defective products in their work, we call them perfunctory workers. These people have never thought about the harm that their insincere attitude towards their entrusted obligations brings to our common cause. The Soviet people very resolutely fight against all phenomena of perfunctory work.
    Constantly caring about increasing and protecting social property, constantly caring about the interests of the socialist state, has become the golden rule of the Soviet people.
    Lenin pointed out: "Communism begins where the ordinary workers display self-sacrificing, strenuous effort to increase productivity of labor, to safeguard every pood of grain, coal, iron and other products, which accrue not to the workers personally, and not to their ‘close kin,’ but to ‘distant kin,’ i.e., to society as a whole, to tens and hundreds of millions of people...." (Collected Works, Volume 24, p. 342).
    This attitude towards labor and socialist property is precisely the characteristic of the vast majority of workers in our country.
    However, there are also facts that sometimes staff members treat people's property carelessly and uneconomically, and treat the property of industrial enterprises, institutions, Soviet farms, machine tractor stations, and collective farms in the same way. The remnants of the private ownership mentality among the backward collective farm peasants and individual leaders of the collective farms are manifested in the fact that they are not honest in fulfilling their state obligations, and that they waste social land and embezzle the wealth of the collective farms in order to increase their personal sideline occupations at the expense of the social and collective farm economy.
    The Soviet people are resolutely fighting against those who embezzle social property, speculators, and bribe-takers, who violate the foundation of the Soviet people's welfare and encroach on social and socialist property. The Soviet Constitution stipulates that those who plot against social property are enemies of the people.
    The workers in our country believe that: sacredly abiding by the Soviet Constitution, enforcing laws, safeguarding discipline, honestly treating social obligations, and respecting the rules of socialist public life are everyone's primary obligations. The laws of the Soviet state embody the interests of all the people of our country in the struggle to build communism. For the Soviet people, the interests of the state and the interests of the people are paramount. That is why in Soviet society there is a resolute struggle in favor of unwavering compliance with Soviet laws, and a resolute struggle against the slightest violation of socialist regulations and state discipline. Needless to say, the Soviet state cannot fail to take sanctions against those who violate Soviet laws.
    The Soviet system encourages the broad masses of the people to engage in conscious and historically significant creation, to engage in active social activities, and to manage the country. The Soviet state is the most democratic country in the world, and it is strong and powerful because it is connected to the masses and has the broad support of millions of workers. The Soviet system, by its nature, is different from and hostile to bureaucratic manifestations.
    Stalin instructed us: "The danger of bureaucracy lies, first of all, in the fact that it buries the tremendous reserves hidden within our system, preventing them from being utilized, striving to turn the creative activity of the masses into zero, using official jargon to imprison it, and turning every new creation of the Party into a small, meaningless constraint. The danger of bureaucracy lies, secondly, in the fact that it cannot withstand the inspection of the implementation situation, and attempts to turn the basic instructions of the leading organization into empty talk that is divorced from life." (Collected Works, Volume 12, pp. 327-328)
    The Bolshevik Party is waging a relentless struggle against bureaucrats—the Party's sworn enemies. The Party is increasingly attracting workers into the state's political life and into the management of state affairs, and the Party is widely developing criticism and self-criticism, which is a powerful means to eradicate bureaucracy and improve all our work.
    In Soviet society, new relationships between people have been formed not only in production, but also in life and in the family. For the first time in history, women are equally and actively participating in all aspects of social and political life as men. The Bolshevik Party educates the workers with communist morality and noble character, and pays great attention to the education of the younger generation and the consolidation of the family. It is for this reason that Soviet society is consistently and irreconcilably fighting against those who have not yet rid themselves of old habits and prejudices in their treatment of women and children.
    One of the oldest and most deeply rooted old remnants in the consciousness of some Soviet people is religious superstition and prejudice. An important means to overcome these remnants is to widely promote natural science knowledge and constantly instill socialist ideas into the consciousness of the working masses.
    As a result of the victory of socialism and the elimination of the exploiting classes, the faces of the Soviet nationalities have fundamentally changed. The feeling of mutual distrust has disappeared forever among them, and the new feeling of friendship and fraternal cooperation among the nationalities has developed and been consolidated. In Soviet society, nationalism has no basis whatsoever, and this nationalism is one of the most stubborn capitalist remnants in people's minds.
    The Bolshevik Party resolutely exposes and cuts off from the root any manifestation of nationalist ideas that are hostile to us, and tries its best to consolidate the fraternal family of the Soviet nationalities, and to educate all nationalities in our country with Soviet ideas of national friendship and with the ideas of proletarian internationalism.
    The Soviet people love their socialist motherland, are proud of its social system and state system, are proud of its most advanced culture, science, literature, and art in the world, and are proud of the socialist achievements attained under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the workers.
    Therefore, naturally, the Soviet people are fighting against the manifestations of cosmopolitanism, against the worship and flattery of foreign countries, and against the worship and flattery of decadent bourgeois culture.
    The decisions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues have given us a clear example: how to resolutely and irreconcilably fight against all manifestations of bourgeois ideology, against apathy and political indifference, against cosmopolitanism and the worship of the bourgeois West, and to fight for the development of the world's most progressive and noblest Soviet socialist culture, science, and art.
    When guiding Soviet society towards communism, the Bolshevik Party is carrying out a broad and constant struggle to eliminate the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, and is educating all the workers in our country with communist consciousness.
    Our workers, peasants, and intellectuals are eliminating the remnants of capitalism in the process of consciously and actively participating in communist construction. Socialist competition, which Comrade Stalin called the communist method of socialist construction, is one of the most important means of giving workers communist education.
    Propagating Marxism-Leninism, improving ideological work, and raising the ideological and political level of all workers play a primary role in the struggle against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that progressive ideas and theories, after being produced on the basis of the urgent tasks of developing social material life, in turn exert a huge organizational, mobilizing, and transforming influence on the course of social development, and facilitate social progress. Marxist-Leninist ideology is this kind of ideology that transforms the world. When mobilizing the workers to participate in the smooth construction of communism, the Bolshevik Party is carrying out the widespread propaganda of Marxist-Leninist ideology, and is instilling communist ideology into the consciousness of the workers. The more the level of ideological work of the Party organizations is improved, the more smoothly the remnants of capitalism in people's minds will be overcome.
    The Soviet state, led by the Lenin-Stalin Party, is a powerful tool for communist education of the masses and for fighting against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds. In the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, the cultural and educational work of the Soviet state has taken on a larger scale.
    The Party and the Soviet state are implementing a huge program of cultural construction, and are putting forward their task as: to make all workers and peasants cultured and educated people. The Party uses all forms and means of political education and ideological education—newspapers, radio, science, literature, film, and art—to drive the remnants of the old world out of the consciousness of the backward parts of the Soviet people.
    The most important means of fighting against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds is to develop criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism help to ruthlessly expose the old and dying, and to reveal the new and growing, and to promote the victory of the new.
    Overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's minds requires educating the workers with a high degree of principle, honesty, and loyalty to the cause of communism, and through the thorough implementation of the rules of socialist society.
    The Bolshevik Party educates the Soviet people with the noble feeling of Soviet patriotism, with courage and perseverance in overcoming difficulties, with hatred of the enemy, and with infinite love and loyalty to the socialist motherland and to the great cause of communism.
    While thoroughly fighting against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, the Bolshevik Party is step by step raising the communist consciousness of the masses, and enabling them to develop their enthusiasm for fighting for communism.

　　关于反对人们意识中的资本主义余孽的斗争
    【新华社讯】莫斯科航讯：真理报读者、军人尼古拉耶夫提出一个问题：“人们意识中的资本主义余孽是什么，怎样克服它们？”真理报于六月十一日发表了解答这个问题的文章，题为《关于反对人们意识中的资本主义余孽的斗争》。全文如下：
    苏维埃人民在列宁——斯大林党领导之下建立了社会主义社会，而且现在正顺利地走向共产主义。现在，对劳动者的共产主义教育，是具有决定意义的工作。
    由于社会主义在我们国内胜利的结果，确立了社会主义所有制在生产资料上所独具的统治地位，也确立了社会主义经济制度。苏联绝大多数人口同社会主义生产直接联系着。我们国家劳动者的物质福利依赖着社会生产的增长，也依赖着苏维埃国家的经济力量。
    为建设共产主义社会而斗争的利益和目的的共同性，把全体苏维埃人民联合起来了。我们的发展之新的强大的动力——苏维埃社会的精神和政治的一致，苏联各民族的友好和苏维埃爱国主义，已在胜利了的社会主义的基础上展开了。
    社会主义的胜利根本改变了苏维埃人们的社会存在。领导着我们人民的伟大建设活动的布尔什维克党，用着巨大的教育工作和思想工作塑造了苏维埃人的新的精神面貌。我们国家绝大多数劳动者现在是自觉的和积极的共产主义建设者。人民和共产主义已在我们国内融合在一起。
    然而，在某些劳动者的意识中，还有旧的习惯、传统和偏见，它们是从资本主义社会遗留下来的，它们阻碍着我们的前进。
    那么，资本主义余孽在人们意识中生存的原因在那里呢？
    马列主义教导我们说：社会意识是由社会存在来决定的。社会生活的物质条件，社会存在，先起了变化，然后人们的意识、观点、嗜好、习惯才随着起变化。加以意识的变化过程总是落后于社会存在的变化过程，赶不上社会生活物质基础的发展，因此，旧的观点、概念等等，也或久或暂地继续起着作用。
    马克思在《哥特纲领批判》中指出未来共产主义社会的特征时写过：共产主义的第一阶段——社会主义阶段，还保存着旧社会的“黑痣”，社会主义是从旧社会内部产生的。从资本主义社会遗留下来的观点、概念、习惯，就是这种“黑痣”。人们意识中的资本主义余孽，在苏维埃制度中没有根据，这些余孽是和苏维埃制度不相干的。
    列宁和斯大林屡次着重指出过，在建立新的、社会主义的生活的时候，人们不能够一举而抛掉自己身上从剥削社会遗留下来的弱点和缺陷。列宁指出过：千百万人的习惯的势力，是最惊人的势力。为了完全克服人们意识中的资本主义余孽，党和国家需要在劳动者的共产主义教育上，进行长期的和有系统的工作。
    敌视我们的资本主义的包围势力，在反对苏维埃国家的斗争中，千方百计地支持和利用某些部分的苏维埃人们意识中的资本主义余孽。
    斯大林同志指示我们：“……虽然资本主义在经济中已被消灭，但是资产阶级观点的余孽却仍然在人们的头脑中保存着，并且将来还会保存着。此外还要估计到，我们所应当时刻防范的资本主义包围势力，是力图复活和支持这种余孽的”。（联共党史简明教程三○七页）
    帝国主义资产阶级企图以各种各样的办法和手段来复活和支持苏维埃人们意识中的资本主义余孽，以便阻止苏维埃社会向共产主义发展，以便破坏社会主义国家的威力。
    共产党进行着反对一切资产阶级思想表现的无情斗争，并且以马列主义思想，以苏维埃爱国主义和高度革命警惕性来教育苏维埃人民。
    以私人所有制的统治和人对人的剥削为基础的资产阶级社会，在人们中间挑动着最下等的本能。
    列宁说过：“旧社会是以这样的原则为基础的，即：或者你抢别人，或者别人抢你；或者你为别人做工，或者别人为你做工；或者你是奴隶主，或者你是奴隶。”（全集第三十卷四一二页）
    在社会主义社会里，人对人的剥削消灭了，一些人靠另一些人的劳动来渔利的可能性消失了。在斯大林宪法中用法律确定起来的社会主义原则，是“各尽所能，各取所值”，“不工作者不得食”。苏联绝大多数劳动者诚实地、忘我地工作着，完全了解自己对祖国、对社会主义国家所负的社会义务。苏维埃人们不是为剥削者而工作，而是为自己，为自己的苏维埃社会而工作。当在资本主义国家内，劳动被鄙视并成为沉重的负担的时候，在苏联，劳动却变为光荣、勇敢和英雄的事业。全民的社会主义竞赛，斯塔哈诺夫运动是苏维埃人们对劳动的新态度的明确表现。
    和资产阶级的个人主义的思想相对立，苏维埃人们的世界观的根本特征是集体主义，它是以从被剥削中解放出来的劳动者的同志合作和社会主义互助的关系为基础的。苏维埃人们根据自身的经验确信：只有社会主义社会才为富裕和文明的生活，为劳动者的天才和能力之完全发展创造着一切条件。
    对劳动的自觉态度，——是苏维埃人们的卓越特点。然而，我们也还有落后的人们，他们破坏社会主义劳动纪律，对于执行国家任务不是采取诚心诚意的态度，在工业企业、机关以及农业生产中，还有怠慢者、懒惰者、生产废品者、唯利是图者。
    不诚心诚意工作的人们，在自己工作中允许有废品的人们，我们叫他们做敷衍工作者。这种人不曾想一想他们对受委托的义务的不诚心态度，带给我们的共同事业的害处。苏维埃人们非常坚决地跟一切敷衍工作的现象作斗争。
    经常关心增加和爱护社会财产，经常关心社会主义国家利益，已成为苏维埃人们的金科玉律。
    列宁指出过：“共产主义在这样的地方开始，当那里出现了普通工人们之忘我地、克服着沉重困难地关心提高劳动生产率，关心爱护每一普特粮食、煤、铁、及其他产品，这些东西不是给工作者个人，也不是给他们的‘近亲’，而是给‘远亲’，即，给全社会整体，给成千成万的人们的……”（全集第二十四卷三四二页）。
    对劳动和对社会主义财产的这种态度，正是我们国家绝大多数劳动者的特色。
    然而也有这样的事实，有时候工作人员不经心地、不节约地对待人民财产，对待工业企业、机关、苏维埃农场、机器拖拉机站、集体农场的财产。集体农场农民中的落后者和集体农场的个别领导者中间私有制的心理余孽，表现在执行国家义务时态度不诚实的事实上，表现在为了损害社会的、集体农场的经济来增益个人的辅业，而浪费社会的土地和侵吞集体农场的财富的事实上。
    苏维埃人民跟侵吞社会财产者、投机买卖者、受贿赂者作坚决的斗争，这些人侵犯着苏维埃人民福利的基础，侵略着社会的、社会主义的财产。苏联宪法规定着，图谋社会财产的人，便是人民的敌人。
    我们国家的劳动者认为：神圣地遵守苏联宪法，执行法律，卫护纪律，诚实地对待社会义务，尊重社会主义公共生活规则，是每个人的首要义务。苏维埃国家的法律，体现着我国全体人民在为建设共产主义而斗争中的利益。对于苏维埃人们，国家利益、人民利益——高于一切。这就是为什么在苏维埃社会中进行着拥护毫不犹豫地遵守苏维埃法律的坚决斗争，进行着反对丝毫违犯社会主义法规和国家纪律的坚决斗争。不用说，苏维埃国家对于破坏苏维埃法律者，不能够不采取制裁办法。
    苏维埃制度提高广大的人民群众去作自觉的有历史意义的创造，去作积极的社会活动，去管理国家。苏维埃国家是世界上最民主的国家，它因为联系群众，和有千百万劳动者的广泛支持而强大雄壮。苏维埃制度就其本性来说是跟官僚主义表现相异的、敌对的。
    斯大林指示我们：“官僚主义的危险性，首先，在于把蓄藏在我们制度内部的巨大的后备力量埋没起来，不让它们被利用，努力把群众的创造积极性变成零，用官样文章来禁锢它，而且把党的每一个新创始变为细小的无谓的箝制。官僚主义的危险性，第二，在于它经不住对执行情形的检查，而且企图把领导组织的基本指示变为跟生活脱离的空谈。”（全集第十二卷，三二七——三二八页）
    布尔什维克党进行着反对官僚主义者——党的不共戴天的敌人——的无情斗争。党愈来愈广泛地吸引劳动者到国家政治生活中去，到国事的管理中去，党广泛地展开批评和自我批评，这是铲除官僚主义和改进我们全部工作的有力手段。
    在苏维埃社会中，不但在生产方面，而且在生活方面，在家庭方面，人与人之间的新关系业已形成。妇女在历史上第一次跟男子平等地积极参加了社会政治生活的一切方面。布尔什维克党以共产主义道德和高尚的品行来教育劳动者，并且大力注意年青一代的教育和家庭的巩固。苏维埃社会一贯不调和地跟那些在对待家庭妇女和儿童方面还没有摆脱旧习惯和偏见的人们作斗争，原因就在这里。
    某些部分的苏维埃人们的意识中最老的和最根深蒂固的旧的余孽之一，是宗教的迷信和偏见。克服这些余孽的重要手段，是广泛展开自然科学知识的宣传，经常灌输社会主义思想到劳动群众意识中去。
    由于社会主义的胜利和剥削阶级消灭的结果，苏联各民族的面貌根本改变了，在他们中间，互不信任的感觉已永远消失了，各民族的友好和兄弟般的合作的新感觉已发展和巩固了。在苏维埃社会里，民族主义没有任何根据，这民族主义是人们意识中最顽固的资本主义余孽之一。
    布尔什维克党坚决揭发和从根砍断和我们敌对的民族主义思想的任何表现，尽量巩固苏联各民族的友爱的家庭，以各民族友好的苏维埃思想，以无产阶级国际主义思想来教育我们国家的一切民族。
    苏维埃人民热爱自己社会主义的祖国，以它的社会制度和国家制度而自豪，以它在世界上最先进的文化、科学、文学、艺术而自豪，以在布尔什维克党，劳动者的伟大领袖斯大林同志领导下所达到的社会主义成就而自豪。
    因此，自然的，苏维埃人们跟世界主义的表现，跟崇拜和恭维外国，崇拜和恭维腐朽的资产阶级文化的表现作斗争。
    联共中央关于思想问题的决定，给了我们鲜明的范例：应当怎样坚决和不调和地跟资产阶级思想的一切表现，跟无思想与不问政治，跟世界主义和崇拜资产阶级西方的表现作斗争，为发展世界上最进步的最高尚的苏维埃社会主义文化、科学和艺术而斗争。
    布尔什维克党在引导苏维埃社会走向共产主义的时候，进行着铲除人们意识中的资本主义余孽的广泛的经常的斗争，以共产主义的自觉来教育我们国家的全体劳动者。
    我们的工人、农民和知识分子是在自觉地积极参加共产主义建设的过程中实行铲除资本主义余孽的。社会主义竞赛，斯大林同志把它叫做社会主义建设的共产主义方法，是给劳动者以共产主义教育的最重要手段之一。
    宣传马列主义，改进思想工作，提高全体劳动者的思想和政治水平，在跟人们意识中的资本主义余孽作斗争时，这些都起着头等作用。
    马列主义教导我们说：进步的思想和理论，在发展社会物质生活的迫切任务的基础上产生之后，又从自己的方面给社会发展行程以巨大的组织、动员和改造的影响，并且便利于社会的前进。马列主义思想就是这种改造世界的思想。布尔什维克党在动员劳动者参加共产主义的顺利建设的时候，进行着马列主义思想的广泛宣传，把共产主义思想灌输到劳动者的意识中。愈提高党组织的思想工作水平，就愈会顺利地克服人们意识中的资本主义余孽。
    由列宁——斯大林党领导的苏维埃国家，是以共产主义教育群众，和跟人们意识中的资本主义余孽作斗争的有力工具。从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的时期中，苏维埃国家的文化教育工作已具有了更大的规模。
    党和苏维埃国家实施着文化建设的庞大纲领，提出自己的任务为：使所有工农成为有文化和有教养的人。党运用政治教育、思想教育的一切方式和手段——报刊、无线电、科学、文学、电影、艺术——把旧世界余孽从落后部分的苏维埃人们的意识中撵出去。
    跟人们意识中的资本主义余孽作斗争的最重要手段，是展开批评和自我批评。批评和自我批评帮助无情地揭发旧的、垂死的，和呈露新的、生长着的，促成新的东西的胜利。
    克服人们意识中的资本主义余孽，是要拿对共产主义事业的高度的原则性，老实和忠诚来教育劳动者，以及用彻底实现社会主义社会的规则来进行的。
    布尔什维克党，以苏维埃爱国主义的高尚感觉，以克服困难时的勇敢和坚毅，以对敌人的仇恨，以对社会主义祖国，对共产主义伟大事业的无限的爱和忠诚，教育苏维埃人们。
    布尔什维克党在跟人们意识中的资本主义余孽作彻底斗争的时候，一步步地提高着群众的共产主义觉悟，使他们为共产主义而斗争的积极性获得发展。
