Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 9th: The Yongding River, one of Hebei Province's largest tributaries, experienced two rapid surges in water level within five days. Thanks to the emergency rescue efforts of the people along the river, disaster was averted. The Yongding River, colloquially known as the "Little Yellow River," has a fierce current and numerous dangerous sections. There are more than twenty well-known dangerous sections below Lugou Bridge. After rainfall near Datong in the upper reaches of the Yongding River on June 29th, the water level at Lugou Bridge rose to 63.22 meters on July 1st, with a flood discharge of 1,100 cubic meters per second, exceeding last year's maximum flow. On July 4th, widespread rainfall occurred again in the upper reaches of the river. On the 5th, the water level at Lugou Bridge rose again to 63.22 meters. Although this water level was the same as the first time, the accumulated water made it difficult to discharge, resulting in a strong current downstream and a very dangerous situation.

When the river water surged, the Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters issued an urgent notice overnight, ordering all defense areas to immediately lead farmers from along the river to patrol and defend the dikes. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government also dispatched Liu Zhongrui, Director of the Engineering Department, along with two technical cadres, to rush to the Yongding River Water Resources Bureau to assist in supervising and guiding the defense. The suburban people's governments of Beijing and Tianjin also sent cadres to work on the river dikes. Through the efforts of leaders at all levels and the vast number of laborers, the two major floods have been safely overcome. For example, a 200-meter section of the Zhaoyingping work area in Liangxiang experienced a dangerous situation, washing away 70 mu of paddy fields on the river beach and further approaching the dike root; however, after the laborers worked hard to repair and add willow revetments, the work area was transformed from danger to safety. Ten dangerous points occurred on the Huling embankment in Wuqing, totaling 1,500 meters in length. The laborers in this section are currently working hard on emergency repairs, which are expected to be completed in seven days. The material for repairing the Zhangjiawu dangerous section in Anci has been prepared and the repairs can also be completed in ten days.

Currently, the river water has begun to recede. All dike sections along the river are now rapidly improving the basic flood control organizations, strengthening the communication network, conducting thorough dike inspections, and stepping up preparations for flood control materials to defend against even greater floods.

[Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Office: The flood season of the Yongding River has arrived, and the embankments near Lugou Bridge in the suburbs of Beijing have been further consolidated through continuous emergency repairs.

The Yongding River embankments under the jurisdiction of the Beijing suburbs are all stone embankments, which are already quite solid. This spring, the Municipal Government Suburban Work Committee organized the Spring Work Committee to renovate or repair the parts of the embankment that had been in disrepair for many years, and also restored two sections of earth embankment totaling 3,600 meters in length, and filled 34 holes. These projects were completed before the flood season. As the flood season approached, the Spring Work Committee was reorganized into the Flood Control Headquarters on June 22nd, and immediately began inspecting the dikes and continuing to raise and thicken some of the embankments.

On the morning of July 1st, the water level at Lugou Bridge once surged to 63.22 meters, and rose again to 63.22 meters on the 5th. During the first surge, the Flood Control Headquarters mobilized 706 laborers to repair a water-blocking dike at the Xiaoging River mouth near Lugou Bridge overnight, and also reinforced an overflow dike between the Yongding River and the Xiaoging River. During the second surge on the 5th, more than 200 laborers were mobilized again, with the strong assistance of more than 1,300 officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the garrison, to raise the water-blocking dike by 20 centimeters, and increase its width from 3 meters to 5 meters. At the same time, an earth dike 311 meters long, 5 meters wide, and 5 decimeters high was added to the back of the overflow dike. The completion of these two projects has ensured that the embankments in the Beijing suburbs can guarantee that the villages along the coast and on both sides of the Xiaoging River downstream will not suffer from flooding as long as the Yongding River water level is below 63.73 meters.

In order to be prepared for any eventuality, emergency rescue teams have now been universally organized in villages within five li of the coast in the Beijing suburbs, and reserve emergency rescue teams have been organized in villages outside five li and within ten li of the river. All the carts in these villages have been formed into transportation teams, ready to transport emergency rescue materials in case of emergency. All the willow trees with a diameter of more than three inches in the villages within five li of the river have been valued and numbered, ready to be used as emergency rescue equipment. The Flood Control Headquarters has also organized the masses along the coast to patrol the dikes and strictly guard against them.

　　永定河水位两次猛涨
    经努力抢险安然度过
    京郊永定河堤防抢修后已更巩固
    【新华社保定九日电】河北省最大干流之一的永定河水位五天内两次猛涨，经沿河人民紧急抢救，致未成灾。永定河俗称小黄河，河水很猛，险工很多。芦沟桥以下的著名险工就有二十几处。在六月二十九日永定河上游大同附近降雨后，七月一日芦沟桥水位涨至六三点二二公尺，洪水流量为一千一百秒公方，超过去年最大流量。七月四日该河上游又普遍降雨。五日卢沟桥水位复涨至六三点二二公尺。这次水位虽然和第一次水位相同，但因积水很多，不易宣泄，下游水势很大，情况十分险恶。
    当河水猛涨时，河北省防汛总指挥部星夜发出紧急通知，命令各防区立即率领沿河各地农民上堤巡逻防守。中央人民政府水利部亦派工务司刘钟瑞司长，偕同技术干部二人，驰赴永定河河务局协助督导防守。北京和天津两市郊区人民政府亦均派干部赶赴河堤工作。经过各级领导干部和广大民工的努力抢险，两次大水均已安然度过。如良乡赵营平工段出险二百公尺，冲去河滩稻田七十亩，更迫近堤根；但经民工努力抢修和加厢挂柳，该工段已化险为夷。武清护路堤发生十处险工，共长一千五百公尺。现该段民工正努力抢险，预计七天可完成。安次张家务险工修堤材料已准备妥当，十天内也可全部修好。
    目前该河河水已开始下降。沿河各堤段现正迅速健全防汛基层组织，加强联络网，并进行深入的堤防检查，加紧准备防汛材料，以防御更大的洪水。
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：永定河汛期已至，京郊芦沟桥一带堤防，经连日抢修，益形巩固。
    京郊所辖永定河河岸堤防全部为石堤，本已相当巩固。今年春季，市府郊区工作委员会组织春工委员会，将多年失修的部分堤岸，加以改修或补修，并修复土堤两段长三千六百公尺，补砌洞穴三十四处。这些工程在汛期以前都已完成。汛期将至时，春工委员会于六月二十二日改组为防汛指挥部，立即进行检查堤防的工作，继续将部分堤岸加高、加厚。
    七月一日晨，芦沟桥水位一度猛涨至六三点二二公尺，五日再度涨至六三点二二公尺。第一次涨水时防汛指挥部动员民工七百零六人彻夜抢修芦沟桥附近小清河口的阻水堤一座，并将永定河与小清河之间的溢流堤一座加固。五日再度涨水时，又动员民工二百余人，在驻军某部一千三百余指战员的大力协助下，将阻水堤加高二十公分，并将其宽度由三公尺增至五公尺。同时在溢流堤背面，加修一座长三一一公尺，宽五公尺，高五公寸的土堤。这两次工程的完成，已使京郊堤防能在永定河水位低于六三点七三公尺以前，保证京郊沿岸和小清河下流两岸村庄不致遭受水患。
    为了有备无患，现在京郊沿岸五里以内村庄已普遍组织抢险大队，沿河五里以外，十里以内村庄已组织抢险后备大队，这些村庄的全部大车都已编成运输队，准备水情紧急时运送抢险物资。沿河五里以内村庄凡直径三寸以上的柳树都已估价编号，准备作为抢险器材。防汛指挥部并已组织沿岸群众上堤巡逻，严密防备。
