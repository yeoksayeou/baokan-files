　　Suburbs Achieve Total Wheat Harvest of 170,000 Shi This Year; Wheat Stubble Planting Roughly Completed
    [Our Newspaper] The wheat harvest in the suburbs of Beijing has completely ended, and the planting of wheat stubble land has been basically completed. This year's harvest is better than last year's, but it is lower than expected due to wheat rust, wind disasters, and insect pests. The average yield per mu is about five dou, with the highest reaching one shi two or three dou, and the lowest only yielding two or three dou. From 335,784 mu of wheat land, approximately 24,340,000 jin of wheat were harvested, equivalent to more than 173,800 shi.
    This year's wheat harvest was carried out after the completion of land reform and with most of the wheat fields already transferred to the hands of the peasants. The peasants applied topdressing fertilizer and actively weeded the wheat. In the past, wheat fields in the suburbs were generally not weeded, but this year they were generally weeded once, and some were weeded more than twice. After the wheat matured, the peasants automatically organized to protect the wheat and defend their own labor results. Thanks to the peasants' day and night guarding, no theft or sabotage occurred in the entire suburban area during the wheat harvest. In response to the black rust and yellow rust disasters this year, various districts promoted seed selection. The peasants changed their thinking that "diseases and pests are in the weather, not in the seeds," and realized that "good seeds lead to good harvests." When Gucheng and Liuniangfu villages in Shijingshan District began seed selection, rumors spread that the seed selection was "for the government." Some peasants, after selecting seeds, went to ask the cadres "where to hand them in?" After the local Communist Party members and Youth League members promptly exposed the rumors, the seed selection proceeded smoothly. The wheat selected by various districts through field ear selection, plot selection, and threshing ground selection with winnowing fans is mostly of good quality, high yield, and strong disease resistance, such as Henan White, Red Mang White, and Monk's Head. Future attention should be paid to the collection, preservation, and variety replacement of seeds to ensure that superior seeds can be promoted.

### 郊区今年收麦共达十七万石  麦茬地播种工作已大致完成

　　郊区今年收麦共达十七万石
    麦茬地播种工作已大致完成
    【本报讯】京郊麦收全部结束，麦茬地播种基本完成。今年收成比去年好，但因小麦锈病及风灾、虫害，较预计收成减低。平均每亩产量在五斗左右，最高的打到一石二、三，最低的仅收二、三斗。三十三万五千七百八十四亩麦地，约收麦二千四百三十四万余斤，合十七万三千八百余石。
    今年麦收是在土地改革结束、大部麦田已转到农民手中的情况下进行的。农民苗青追肥，积极锄麦。往年郊区麦地一般不锄，今年普遍锄过一遍，个别的锄了两遍以上。麦熟后农民自动组织护麦，保卫自己的劳动成果。由于农民日夜守护，麦收期间全郊区均未发生偷窃破坏事件。各区针对今年黑疸、黄疸为灾的情况，宣传选种。农民转变了“病害在天时，不在种籽”的想法，认识到“好种籽才有好收成”。石景山区古城和刘娘府村开始选种时曾流传谣言说选种是“给政府选的”。有的农民选完了就去问干部“交哪儿？”经当地共产党员、青年团员及时揭破后，选种始顺利进行。各区经田间穗选、片选和在场里用簸箕选出的麦子，多是成色好，产量大，抗病力强的河南白、红芒白、和尚头等；今后应注意的问题是种籽的收藏、保纯和换种等，以使优良种籽得以推广。
