　　Beijing Cultural Centers Launch Mass Anti-Aggression Activities
    [Our Newspaper News] In recent days, the cultural centers of Beijing have actively launched propaganda work against the US aggression in Taiwan and Korea.

    Each center has listed this propaganda work as the central task of this stage. First, they organized all cadres of the center and active members of the masses to earnestly study and discuss various documents and reports related to the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea, so that each propaganda worker has a correct understanding and awareness of the US imperialist's aggressive behavior ideologically. Then, based on the backbone elements of the workers' night schools, women's literacy classes, spare-time tutoring night schools, and the existing amateur art organizations in each center, they mobilized and organized the masses to carry out in-depth and extensive anti-US imperialist aggression propaganda activities through oral, written, pictorial, and various artistic forms.

    The cultural centers posted current affairs bulletins, wall newspapers, situation maps of the Korean War of Liberation, and various cartoons everywhere. They used simple and easy-to-understand paintings or texts to answer questions that might exist in the minds of the masses, which were warmly welcomed by the masses. Citizens crowded around to watch all day long.

    The centers also made reports on the issue of opposing US imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea through mass lectures. At the same time, they meticulously arranged for further in-depth discussion forums. Participants included workers, women, students, shop assistants, etc., who all unanimously believed that the barbaric act of US imperialism's armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan would eventually be defeated. Everyone also believed that due to the increasing strength of the world's peaceful and democratic forces and the weakening of imperialist forces, if the US imperialists dared to launch a new war, they would follow in the footsteps of the demise of German fascism.

    In the propaganda, the cultural centers cooperated with the propaganda vehicles of the opera training classes; organized mass evening parties; conducted family visits; and mobilized the masses to write letters to express their condolences to the Korean people. Currently, more than 10,000 people have been mobilized and organized, and this mass propaganda movement is gradually expanding. (Wang Yan)

　　北京市各文化馆展开群众性反侵略活动
    【本报讯】北京市各文化馆，连日来积极地展开了反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动的宣传工作。
    各馆将这次的宣传工作，列为这一阶段的中心任务，首先组织全馆干部及群众中的积极分子，认真地进行了有关美国侵略台湾、朝鲜问题各种文件、报告的学习与讨论，使每个宣传工作人员，从思想上对美帝这一侵略行为，具有正确的了解与认识；然后，再以工人夜校、妇女识字班、业余补习夜校及各馆现有的业余文艺组织中的骨干分子为基础，发动与组织群众，通过口头、文字、绘画及不同的文艺形式，深入地、广泛地展开了反对美帝侵略宣传运动。
    文化馆在各处张贴时事简报、壁报、朝鲜解放战争形势图及各种漫画，针对群众思想中可能存在的问题，用简明易懂的绘画或文字进行解答，受到群众的热烈欢迎，市民终日围观拥挤不堪。
    各馆又通过大众讲习会，普遍地作了反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜问题的报告，同时，又缜密地布置了更进一步深入讨论的座谈。参加者有工人、妇女、学生、店员等，都一致相信，美帝武装侵略朝鲜、台湾的野蛮行为，终将被击败。大家并认为：由于世界和平民主力量的日益强大，帝国主义力量的日形削弱，美帝如胆敢发动新战争，便将蹈德国法西斯灭亡的覆辙。
    文化馆在宣传中，并配合戏曲讲习班的宣传车；组织群众性晚会；进行家庭访问；动员群众写信慰问朝鲜人民。现已动员组织了群众达万余人，而且这一群众性的宣传运动，正在逐步扩展中。（王雁）
