　　About Turkish Poet Nazım Hikmet
    Chen Weiming
    Regarding the Turkish revolutionary poet Nazım Hikmet, I gave a brief introduction in the "People's Literature and Art" supplement of the People's Daily on May 21st, and also translated one of his poems, "My Heart." Recently, I translated two more of his poems, "Letter from Prison" and "The 20th Century." After reading these three poems, we can see that Nazım Hikmet is indeed an outstanding revolutionary and talented poet who fought for democracy and freedom. Because of this, he is hated by the Turkish reactionaries, who even fabricated charges, falsely accusing him of undermining military morale, and sentenced him to a long prison term of twenty-eight years and four months, from 1938 to the present, a total of twelve years. He has suffered greatly in this long and dark solitary confinement, completely damaging his health. The poet requested to be released from prison for medical treatment to the Turkish government this March, but was unreasonably rejected by the reactionary authorities. Therefore, the poet began a hunger strike on April 8th to protest.

    According to a TASS dispatch on May 8th, a Turkish journalist visited the poet Hikmet in the prison where he was being held and spoke with his doctor. According to the doctor, Hikmet had not eaten anything for six days, smoked a lot, and only drank four or five cups of water and a few cups of coffee each day. According to the doctor, a person in this condition can only survive for less than a month. Hikmet already had difficulty moving and his body temperature had dropped significantly below normal.

    According to a message from the Turkish newspaper "Son Posta," on May 17th, due to the deterioration of Nazım Hikmet's health, he was transferred to the pulmonary clinic of the "Jandarmerie-Paşa" Hospital. Hikmet had lost eight kilograms in weight during the hunger strike. His physical strength was greatly weakened. He himself told reporters that he could no longer get out of bed or read the newspaper. The doctor had stated to Hikmet that if he continued his hunger strike, he would only be able to survive for another seven to ten days and advised him to stop the hunger strike. But this suggestion was rejected by Hikmet. At that time, this revolutionary poet, a staunch fighter for democracy, Hikmet issued a solemn statement:

    "I am not on hunger strike because I have lost hope, but because I want to fight for justice!"

    Nazım Hikmet's mother, the artist Canlı, also published a statement in the Turkish newspaper "Vatan": she was on hunger strike with her son. Canlı took a notice to the busiest street to post, which read: "My son Nazım Hikmet has been unjustly tried and has declared a hunger strike. Now I am on hunger strike with my son. Whoever is willing to rescue us, please sign the petition."

    The poet's mother began collecting signatures of people willing to join the request for Hikmet's release. Canlı also said: "I believe that in two days I will collect twenty to thirty thousand signatures." Hikmet's mother wants to send this petition to the President of the Turkish Republic, İnönü.

    Canlı was arrested by the police and released after interrogation.

    Hikmet's case has aroused great attention and concern from the Soviet Union and progressive people around the world. Following the joint appeal by twenty-one poets, including Aseyev, Tikhonov, Simonov, and Isakovsky, on April 19th in the Soviet Union to rescue Hikmet, the Department of Literature and Language of the Academy of Sciences and the Oriental Institute jointly convened a meeting to support the Turkish democratic poet Nazım Hikmet, and passed a letter of condolences to the poet. The letter of condolences is translated as follows:

    "Dear Nazım Hikmet!

    We, Soviet literary researchers and scholars, send warm greetings to you, a patriot and fearless fighter for peace!

    Your outstanding creations have opened a new era in Turkish literature, and your passionate poems in Turkish poetics echo the call to fight for the national and social liberation of the Turkish people.

    Your name is listed alongside the best poets of the modern glorious struggle for freedom, peace and national independence.

    Your name is dear and precious to people all over the world. Just people in all countries are outraged by the terrible violence used by the reactionaries to destroy your creation and your life.

    You bravely stood on the side of the Turkish workers and peasants, on the side of the invincible camp of peace and democracy, on the side of the fighters against imperialism and the dark forces of reaction.

    The traitorous rulers of Turkey have imprisoned you for many years, because the dignity and independence of the Turkish nation are not precious to them, and have long been sold to British and American imperialism. Neither prison nor the threat of death can destroy you. Your voice, like an alarm bell, summons the people to fight for freedom and happiness.

    We, Soviet scholars, are indignant at the absurd trial you have suffered. We loudly protest against the outrageous atrocities and demand your immediate release - the great poet of the Turkish nation, the pride of modern Turkish literature.

    Signatories: Academician Alekseyev, Vinogradov and eight others of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Corresponding Academician Peyr Tritsch, Yegorin and six others of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences Pavlovkov, Professor Chakhoter, Doctor of History."

### 关于土耳其诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特

　　关于土耳其诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特
    陈微明
    关于土耳其革命诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特，我在五月二十一日人民日报副刊《人民文艺》上曾有简单的介绍，并译载了他的一首诗《我的心》。最近我又译了他的两首诗，《寄自狱中的信》和《二十世纪》。读了这三首诗，我们已能看到：拿瑞姆·希克梅特确是一位卓越的为民主自由而奋斗的革命的天才诗人。正因为这样，他为土耳其反动派所仇视，甚至捏造罪名，诬称他动摇军心，而判处他二十八年零四个月的长期徒刑，从一九三八年起到如今已经十二个年头了。他在这长年累月的黑暗的单人监禁的生活里受尽了折磨，完全损坏了健康。诗人于今年三月间向土耳其政府提出要求出狱治疗，而遭到反动当局无理拒绝。于是诗人从四月八日起开始绝食，以示抗议。
    据五月八日塔斯社讯：一个土耳其记者曾去诗人希克梅特被监禁的狱中访问，并和他的医生谈了话。据医生说，希克梅特已经有六天什么也没有吃，烟抽得多，每天只喝四五杯水与几盅咖啡。照医生的意见，一个人在这样的情况下只能维持生命不到一个月，希克梅特已经行动困难，体温已比正常的降低许多。
    另据土耳其报《松保斯达》所发消息称，五月十七日由于拿瑞姆·希克梅特健康状况的恶化，他被移至“乾拉赫——巴夏”医院的肺病诊疗所。希克梅特在绝食过程中体重已经减轻了八公斤。他的体力大大地衰弱了。他自己告诉记者说，他已不能起床，也不能读报。医生曾向希克梅特声明，如继续绝食，他只能再维持七天至十天的生命，并向他建议停止绝食。但这个建议被希克梅特拒绝了。当时这位革命诗人，坚强的民主战士，希克梅特发出严正的声明说：
    “我绝食不是因为我失去了希望，而是因为我要争取正义！”
    拿瑞姆·希克梅特的母亲，艺术家乾莉力在土耳其报《瓦丹》上也发表声明：他和儿子一起绝食。乾莉力拿了一张布告到人最多的大街去张贴，布告上写道：“我的儿子拿瑞姆·希克梅特受到不公正的裁判，已宣布绝食。现在我和儿子一起绝食。谁愿意援救我们，谁就在请愿书上签名。”
    诗人母亲开始收集愿意加入请求释放希克梅特的人们的签名。乾莉力并说：“我相信，在两天内我将收集到二三万的签名。”希克梅特的母亲要把这个请愿书送给土耳其共和国总统伊内牛。
    乾莉力被警察逮捕，经审询后才释出。
    希克梅特的事件已经引起苏联以及全世界进步人士的极大注意和关心。在苏联接着阿赛耶夫、吉洪诺夫、西蒙诺夫、伊萨柯夫斯基等二十一位诗人于四月十九日联名发出援救希克梅特的呼吁书以后，科学院的文学与语言部联合东方学院又召开了声援土耳其民主诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特的大会，会上并通过致书慰问诗人。兹将慰问书译出如下：
    “亲爱的拿瑞姆·希克梅特！
    我们，苏维埃的文学研究者、学者，向你，爱国者与无畏的和平战士，致热烈的敬礼！
    你的卓越的创作在土耳其文学上开辟了新的时代，你的热情的诗篇在土耳其的诗学中响着去为土耳其人民的民族的与社会的解放而斗争的号召。
    你的名字和现代为自由，为和平与民族独立光荣斗争的最好的诗人们并列在一起。
    你的名字对全世界人民是亲切的，贵重的。各国公正的人们对于反动派以可怕的暴力来摧残你的创作和你的生命感到愤慨。
    你勇敢地站到土耳其工人和农民这边，站到和平与民主的不可战胜的阵营这边，站到反对帝国主义与反动派的黑暗势力的战士这边来了。
    土耳其卖国的统治者把你长年囚禁在牢狱里，因为土耳其民族的尊严与独立对他们是不可贵的，这早已出卖给英美帝国主义了。牢狱也吧，死的威胁也吧，都不能毁损你，你的声音和警钟一样，召唤人民为自由与幸福而斗争。
    我们，苏维埃的学者，愤激于你所受到的荒谬的裁判。我们大声抗议，反对胡作非为的暴行并要求立即释放你——伟大的土耳其民族诗人，现代土耳其文学的骄傲。
    签名者：苏联科学院院士阿列克赛也夫、维诺格拉多夫等八人，苏联科学院通讯院士裴尔脱力士、叶戈林等六人，乌兹贝克科学院院士包洛夫可夫、历史学博士查霍捷尔教授。”
