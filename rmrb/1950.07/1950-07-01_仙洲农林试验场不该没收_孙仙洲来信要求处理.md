　　The Xianzhou Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station Should Not Have Been Confiscated
    Sun Xianzhou's letter requests handling.

    To the Editors:
    I am Sun Xianzhou from Shiliwan, Dacheng County. In 1920, I founded an agricultural and forestry experiment station called the Xianzhou Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, covering an area of about twenty mu. Through my painstaking management, it fortunately became a forest. The entire station has more than five thousand trees, including various types such as peppercorns, pears, peaches, and dates. In 1948, when land reform was implemented, my village actually distributed the station, dividing it among more than ten farming households. They did not intend to manage it long-term, and were cutting down the fruit trees to burn charcoal. Seeing the fruit trees that I had painstakingly cultivated into a forest for more than thirty years being destroyed, my heart aches. My child went to the county government to talk to County Chief Wang and other county leaders multiple times. They told us to handle it with the district and village. However, before the distribution, I had returned to the village to find Qi Liuhe (a leader in my village), who scared me by saying, "You still want your garden? If you come again, others will arrest you." Therefore, I dared not talk to him anymore. In April 1949, I wrote a report to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. On April 25th, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry approved and transferred it to the county government for research and handling. I also discussed it with the county magistrate in the county, but still did not get a concrete solution. On April 18th of last year, the Hebei Daily published news about the destruction of trees in Shiliwan and demanded a stop to the destructive actions. However, the destruction has not stopped and has become even more severe than before. Very few fruit trees are left now.
    Editor, is their approach reasonable? I hope you can resolve this matter.

    Editor's Note: According to the "Instructions on Handling Agricultural Land Issues in the Suburbs of Cities in Old Liberated Areas" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, Sun Xianzhou's agricultural and forestry experiment station should not be allowed to be destroyed. We hope that the Dacheng County Government will investigate and handle this matter, and inform us of the investigation findings, the measures to protect the fruit trees, and the proposed handling opinions.

### 仙洲农林试验场不该没收  孙仙洲来信要求处理

　　仙洲农林试验场不该没收
    孙仙洲来信要求处理编者同志：
    我是大城县十里湾人，名叫孙仙洲。一九二○年我创办了一个农林试验场，名叫仙洲农林试验场，占地二十亩左右。经我惨淡经营，幸得成林。全场共有五千余株树，有花椒、梨、桃、枣等多种。一九四八年实行土地改革，我乡竟将该场实行分配，分给十多家农户。他们不打算长期经营，拿果木树砍伐烧炭。我看到自己三十多年来一手辛苦培育成林的果木遭到毁坏，心里实在痛惜。我的孩子到县政府跟王县长和县里其他负责人谈过多次，他们要我们到区里和村里处理。但过去在分配之前我曾回村找过齐六合（我村里一个负责人），他吓唬我说：“你还要你的园子？你再来，旁人要逮捕你。”因此，我再不敢和他谈了。一九四九年四月，我写了呈文给农林部。四月二十五日农林部批交县政府研究处理。我又到县里和县长讨论，仍没有得到一个具体处理办法。去年四月十八日河北日报曾刊登十里湾破坏树木的消息，并要求停止破坏的行动。可是目前破坏并未停止，反较前更烈。现在所剩果木甚少了。
    编辑先生，他们这样做法是否合理？希望你能解决这件事。

    编者按：按照中央人民政府政务院《关于处理老解放区市郊农业土地问题的指示》，孙仙洲的农林试验场是不应该听任它被破坏的。望大城县政府调查处理。并将调查的情况和保护果木的办法及准备如何处理的意见告诉我们。
