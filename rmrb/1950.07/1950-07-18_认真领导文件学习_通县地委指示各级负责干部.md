　　Conscientiously Lead Document Study
    Tong County Party Committee Instructs Responsible Cadres at All Levels

　　In order to lay the foundation for the rectification study, the Party members and cadres of the directly subordinate organs of the Tong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, after the Hebei Provincial Party Congress, studied the central and North China Bureau's instructions on rectification and reports on rectification. During the study, many cadres exposed many incorrect understandings of this rectification. Some people believed that "this rectification is nothing great, just gentle breezes and mild rains, it's just a slightly deeper group meeting." Some people thought, "There are no major mistakes, just a small review and it's over." Others believed that "the method of gentle breezes and mild rains cannot solve any problems." And some individual comrades were afraid of rectification. The reasons for these incorrect understandings are: some units have weak ideological leadership, and responsible cadres did not personally lead the study, but handed it over to the branch or study committee, so the ideological understanding of party members and cadres was not sufficiently improved. Some units put rectification in opposition to work, emphasizing that work is busy and there is no time to study, failing to understand that the purpose of rectification is to improve work, and therefore it must be combined with work. Based on the above situation, the district committee has instructed the responsible comrades of each unit to personally lead the cadres to study the documents, so that all cadres can clearly understand the purpose and method of rectification.

### 认真领导文件学习  通县地委指示各级负责干部

　　认真领导文件学习
    通县地委指示各级负责干部
    为给整风学习打下基础，河北通县中共地委直属机关党员干部，曾在河北省党代会后，学习了中央及华北局等关于整风指示和关于整风的报告。在学习中不少干部暴露了他们对此次整风有很多不正确的认识。有些人认为“这次整风没有什么了不起的，和风细雨的不要紧，还不就是开个比较深刻的小组会。”有些人认为“大错误没有，小错误检讨一下就过去了。”另有些人则认为“和风细雨的方式解决不了什么问题。”也有个别同志对整风害怕。造成这些错误认识的原因是：有些单位思想领导不强，负责干部没有亲自领导学习，只交给支部或学委会去搞，所以对提高党员干部思想认识作得很不够。有的单位把整风和工作对立起来，强调工作忙，没时间学习，不了解整风目的就是为了改进工作，因之必须结合工作进行。根据以上情况，地委已指示各单位负责同志必须亲自领导干部学习文件，使所有干部明确整风的目的和方法。
