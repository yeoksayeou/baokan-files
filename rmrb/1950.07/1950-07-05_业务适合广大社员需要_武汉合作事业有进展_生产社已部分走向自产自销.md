Xinhua News Agency, Hankou: Wuhan's cooperative undertakings are gradually unfolding. According to statistics, as of the end of May, under the leadership and assistance of the Wuhan Cooperative General Society Preparatory Committee, 250 consumer, production, and supply and marketing cooperatives have been formally established or are being prepared for establishment throughout the city. These include 97 workers' consumer cooperatives, 9 for government organizations, 105 for schools, 5 for street communities, 15 supply and marketing cooperatives for suburban farmers, and 15 production cooperatives, with a total of 94,898 members and 205,987 family members, with a total share capital of 2,142,437,553 yuan.

	Each consumer cooperative has played a very good role in supplying members with daily necessities and ensuring their livelihood, thus gaining the trust of members and gradually expanding their business. For example, the Wuhan Cart Workers' Fourth Consumer Cooperative's turnover in May reached 9,322,900 yuan, selling a large amount of rice, sesame oil, and other daily necessities such as towels, cigarettes, and soap. In May, the cooperative lent 75,000 jin of rice to 371 members, helping them solve their livelihood difficulties. The 15 supply and marketing cooperatives for suburban farmers have also initially launched supply and marketing operations, partially solving the difficulties of farmers in their lives and production.

	Production cooperatives have begun to move from undertaking all processing businesses to partial self-production and self-sales, and have established production and sales relationships with consumer cooperatives. For example, the production department of the Liberation Clothing Production Cooperative, which in the past mainly relied on processing work to maintain production, took the initiative in April to establish production and sales relationships with several consumer cooperatives, supplying them with various types of clothing they needed, opening up product sales channels, and improving the quality of finished products compared to the past. Currently, the Wuhan Cooperative General Society Preparatory Committee and the Hankou Branch of the People's Bank of China are planning to provide necessary loans to various production cooperatives to support their continued development.

　　业务适合广大社员需要
    武汉合作事业有进展       
    生产社已部分走向自产自销
    【本报讯】据新华社汉口讯：武汉市合作事业日渐展开。据统计，截至五月底止，在武汉市合作总社筹备委员会的领导与帮助下，全市已正式成立和正在筹备成立的消费、生产、供销合作社达二百五十个单位。其中包括工人消费合作社九十七个；机关九个；学校一百零五个；街道五个；郊区农民供销合作社十五个，生产合作社十五个；共有社员九万四千八百九十八人，社员家属共达二十万五千九百八十七人，股金共达二十一亿四千二百四十三万七千五百五十三元。
    各消费合作社在供应社员日常生活必需品，保障社员生活上已起了很好的作用，因而取得了社员的信任，业务逐渐展开。如武汉市板车工人第四消费合作社五月份的营业额达九百三十二万二千九百元，售出了大量的食米、麻油及其他毛巾、香烟、肥皂等日常用品。该社五月份曾贷给三百七十一名社员七万五千斤食米，帮助他们解决生活困难。郊区农民的十五个供销社也已初步展开了供销业务，部分解决了农民生活与生产上的困难。
    生产合作社已开始由全部承做加工业务走向部分的自产自销并与消费合作社建立产销关系。如解放被服生产合作社的生产部，过去大部靠做加工活维持生产，四月份主动与若干消费合作社建立了产销关系，供给其所需各种服装，打开了产品销路，成品质量亦较过去提高。现武汉市合作总社筹委会与中国人民银行汉口分行，正计划给各生产合作社以必需的贷款，扶助其继续发展。
