Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The China People's Anti-U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Committee has issued a "Letter to Taiwan Compatriots," the full text of which is as follows: Dear Taiwan Compatriots!

　　On June 27th, U.S. President Truman issued a presumptuous statement, announcing the invasion of Taiwan and attacking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, interfering in the liberation movements of the people of Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries. This crime of U.S. imperialism, which undermines peace in the Far East and the world, has aroused the anger and opposition of the people of our country, the people of the East, and the people of the whole world.

　　After the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism began to support the reactionaries in Eastern countries—Chiang Kai-shek in China, Syngman Rhee in Korea, etc.—and supported the remaining fascist forces in Japan, using them to oppose and enslave the Eastern people, attempting to turn China, Korea, Japan, and the entire Southeast Asia into its colonies. But all its efforts and conspiracies have failed. Therefore, U.S. imperialists have further directly used armed forces to carry out aggression against the Eastern people. This behavior of U.S. imperialism proves that it has embarked on the dead end that Japanese imperialism took.

　　The heroic struggle of hundreds of millions of people in the East cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War over the past four years and the recent victorious counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army prove that the U.S. cannons, airplanes, warships, and dollars will inevitably be defeated by the armed forces of the Eastern people.

　　The Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are determined to crush the obstruction of U.S. imperialism and liberate Taiwan, which is unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan are members of the big family of the Chinese nation. No conspiracy of U.S. imperialism can change this fact. In the past four or five years, U.S. imperialists and their running dogs have played many conspiracies in Taiwan, attempting to turn Taiwan into its colony. The Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits are now also dreaming of using Taiwan as their last hiding place. But 475 million Chinese people will surely defeat all the struggles of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, overcome all difficulties, liberate Taiwan, and liberate all of China.

　　Taiwan compatriots, although you are still under the crazy oppression of the U.S. imperialist Chiang bandits today, do not be misled by the intimidation of U.S. imperialism. Taiwan compatriots! All patriotic officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army! Resolutely strive for the liberation of Taiwan! The people of the whole country, all fraternal nations in the East, and peace-loving people all over the world are fighting with you. The dark years will eventually dawn. The victorious Chinese people, tempered in war, will surely plant the Five-Star Red Flag on our territory, Taiwan!

　　Oppose the U.S. aggressors!
　　Eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits!
　　Long live the liberation of the Taiwan people!
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会
    号召台湾同胞努力争求解放
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会顷发表《告台湾同胞书》，全文如下：亲爱的台湾同胞们！
    六月二十七日，美国总统杜鲁门发表了狂妄的声明，宣布侵略台湾，并进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，干涉越南、菲律宾等国人民的解放运动。美帝国主义的这一破坏远东和世界和平的罪行，已激起了我国人民、东方人民和全世界人民的愤怒和反对。
    第二次世界大战结束后，美帝国主义就开始支持东方各国的反动派——中国的蒋介石、朝鲜的李承晚等，并扶持日本的法西斯残余势力，通过他们来反对与奴役东方人民，企图使中国、朝鲜、日本和整个东南亚变做它的殖民地。但是它的一切努力和阴谋都失败了。因此，美帝国主义者就进一步地直接用武装力量来对东方人民进行侵略。美帝国主义的这种行为，证明了它已经走上了日本帝国主义所走过的绝路。
    东方数万万人民的英勇斗争，是任何反动派的力量所不能阻止的。四年来中国人民解放战争的胜利，和最近朝鲜人民军的胜利反攻，证明了美国的大炮、飞机、军舰和美元，都必然为东方人民武装所击败。
    中央人民政府和中国人民解放军决心粉碎美帝国主义的阻挠而解放台湾，这是全国人民所一致拥护的。台湾是中国的领土，台湾人民是中华民族大家庭中的一员。美帝国主义的任何阴谋，决不能改变这个事实。四、五年来，美帝国主义者和他的走狗，在台湾玩弄过不少的阴谋，企图把台湾变成它的殖民地。蒋介石残余匪帮现在也在梦想用台湾做最后的藏身之地。但是四万万七千五百万中国人民，必能击败美帝国主义及其走狗的一切挣扎，战胜一切困难，解放台湾，解放全中国。
    台湾同胞们，你们今天虽然还在美帝蒋匪的疯狂压迫之下，但是你们不要为美帝国主义的恫吓所迷惑。台湾同胞们！国民党军官兵中一切有爱国心的人们！坚决为台湾的解放努力吧！全国人民，全东方各兄弟民族，全世界爱好和平的人民正和你们在一起奋斗。黑暗的岁月终将破晓。在战争中百炼成钢的胜利的中国人民，一定把五星红旗插到我国的国土台湾！
    反对美国侵略者！
    消灭蒋介石残余匪帮！
    台湾人民解放万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
