Party Life

　　I and my fellow workers are as united as brothers!
　　Zhao Fucheng, Beijing Automobile Repair Factory
　　I am a Communist Party member working at the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory. Under the guidance of the Party, I know that a worker-Party member in a factory must unite with the masses around him to do a good job in production in order to truly serve the people. If I only work hard myself without uniting the masses, my role in production will be very limited. Before last year's "July 1st," I didn't do very well in uniting the masses and made the mistake of being detached from the masses. At that time, I looked down on fellow workers who were not sufficiently aware, often said "labeling" words to stimulate them, and even ignored them, feeling that it was not worth talking to backward elements. Sometimes, when fellow workers unconsciously said some backward things, I not only didn't patiently explain to them, but instead interrupted and "argued" with them. I didn't humbly accept the opinions that fellow workers gave me, and I always felt that their opinions were incorrect and that I was stronger than them. Sometimes, when fellow workers had opinions about the trade union or the administration, I neither reported them to the branch nor helped them to raise them to the leadership for research; instead, I said that they were only planning for personal interests and not concerned about the factory. This aroused the dissatisfaction of the fellow workers with me. They didn't say anything to my face, but they whispered behind my back, and sometimes they deliberately stimulated me: "He is a Party member, really responsible, he can even carry the sky!" I couldn't find out anything about the real situation of the fellow workers' lives and thoughts. In this deadlock, my mood was also low, and I felt that the work was not easy to do. I didn't dare to say anything even if fellow workers made mistakes in production! For example, when I saw fellow workers wasting materials, I felt heartache and anxiety, but it was better if I didn't say anything, the more I said, the more waste there was.
　　The problem was already so serious, but I still didn't know to examine myself, and I always thought that others were backward. After participating in the municipal party committee cadre training class in May last year, with the help of the Party and comrades, I deeply felt that I had made the mistake of being detached from the masses. After returning from the study, I was determined to put down the burden. When I went back to work in the factory, because I had been away from everyone for a long time, I was still a little superficial when we first met. We greeted each other, and there was still some enthusiasm. I seized this opportunity to make a profound self-criticism to everyone, and I also asked everyone to give me more opinions. The fellow workers were happy to hear my self-criticism, and some said: "You have said your shortcomings very thoroughly, I can't think of anything else for a while, in the future, if we see that you have any problems, we will definitely bring them up to you." From then on, I became closer to my fellow workers day by day! Fellow workers said everything to my face, and they also sincerely put forward their opinions. If their opinions were correct, I would report them to the branch or be responsible for conveying them to the administration and the trade union; if their opinions were incorrect, I would patiently explain them to them. In this way, I slowly laid a foundation with everyone emotionally. On this basis, I used various methods to carry out policy propaganda. I do not stick to forms, do not limit time, and conduct it whenever and wherever there is an opportunity. Accepting the lessons of past failures, I know that it is not enough to tell fellow workers theoretical articles. Because fellow workers cannot understand theoretical articles all at once, and therefore do not like to listen to them, and it makes fellow workers tired after a long time; some fellow workers will also feel that you are trying to show off your skills and show off. My method is to use real and vivid examples to conduct propaganda in connection with the actual situation of the factory in a casual chat manner. Whether there are many or few people, I will talk whenever I have the opportunity. Before talking, I must consider the role of what I say; I must also consider what problems the other party has and what they need to hear, and then decide what to talk about and how to talk about it. As long as I find a problem, I will talk once, twice, or three times, and I must get through the other party's thinking until he completely understands it. For example, when I see some fellow workers who don't like to study, or who are discouraged and discouraged in their studies, I will chat with them about the stories of Zhao Zhankui and Liu Yingyuan. For example, when I see some fellow workers who don't know how to save, I will chat with them about the story of picking coal cinders and the story of disaster victims digging wild vegetables. When they pay attention to the story and have some understanding in their minds, I will pull the conversation back to connect with their specific problems and patiently make comparative explanations. In this way, the fellow workers can easily feel their own mistakes and will be satisfied to accept the opinions given to them. Fellow worker Yu Zuochi said: "We can understand things that we don't understand after Lao Zhao talks to us, and sometimes we still feel confused after listening to others for a long time. Lao Zhao's talk is not only easy to understand, but also teaches us a lot of things."
　　I also pay attention to encouraging fellow workers to make suggestions. When they make suggestions, I first consider them carefully. If I think they are correct, I will also give him some additional reasons to teach him to make them; for opinions with insufficient reasons, I patiently explain to him where the reasons are still insufficient. Some fellow workers said: "Fortunately, I talked to you first, and then I knew that this opinion was not good, otherwise, I would have been asked and left speechless, then it would be embarrassing." After using this propaganda and education method, some of the various problems I encountered have been solved. I also have a considerable prestige in this production team. The fellow workers have also learned to pay attention to and analyze problems. In the past, fellow workers who did not like to talk at meetings also dared to ask questions. For example, Li Qingheng said: "Our team is really great, everyone dares to make suggestions. I'm afraid the trade union feels troubled. This is all taught by Lao Zhao." When fellow workers are resting, they are willing to chat with me.
　　In production and handling other trivial matters, I have also researched some methods. I often pay attention to everyone's work and the use of materials. I found that they poured half a washbasin of gasoline when washing electric rollers. If you use it sparingly, a bowl is enough to wash a small roller. They waste half a basin if they can't use it all. At first, I told them to save, but this is the habit of the past, and it doesn't attract everyone's attention all at once. After that, I put away the oil that I received. When I saw them dismantling the rollers and wanted to wash them, I poured them into the basin and served them like an apprentice, but I poured very little, and poured more if it was not enough. In this way, I slowly helped everyone develop the habit of saving. Now everyone automatically pays attention to saving when using materials. In production, on the one hand, I helped the production team leader, telling him to discuss work with everyone more, and on the other hand, I inspired and encouraged everyone in the conversation. In this way, everyone's labor attitude has improved, and they have all become responsible and can take the initiative to come up with ideas to overcome difficulties, and no longer deliberately find trouble for the team leader.
　　If fellow workers make small mistakes in labor discipline, I will wait until he is alone to explain to him and help him recognize his mistakes so as not to repeat them. In this way, I have saved him face, and he is more likely to accept the opinion and recognize his mistake. When the self-criticism meeting is held, he will automatically make a self-criticism. When fellow workers make mistakes, I am responsible for persuasion and education, rather than reporting small things to the higher authorities. But I will definitely be responsible for correcting the mistakes. I often pay attention to the enthusiasm of the fellow workers in their work. As long as someone has a better place than usual in their work, no matter how big or small the contribution, I will report it to the higher authorities in time to praise him. The fellow workers who are praised are especially happy, and feel that now even a little good will not be buried; and the higher authorities did not say anything when they made mistakes. Therefore, everyone is willing to work for the better and pay attention to not making mistakes, and feels that it would be letting down the Party and the people if they made mistakes again. To strengthen the unity between fellow workers, do not let them have opinions. If I find that someone has an opinion on someone, I will explain it to them in time. Treat every fellow worker the same, help them the same, and do not be partial. If the fellow workers tell me about the trivial matters in their families, I will patiently help him study the methods, even if I cannot solve them, I will do my best. Now I and my fellow workers are as united as brothers. Fellow worker Yu Zuochi said: "Lao Zhao, you are so good, you care for everyone like a brother, and you help everyone the same. Even a brother is not so attentive. Everyone is happy together, and working is also energetic."

### 我和工友们团结得像亲兄弟一样！

专栏：党的生活

　　我和工友们团结得像亲兄弟一样！
    北京汽车修配厂  赵福成
    我是一个共产党员，在北京汽车修配厂工作。在党的教导下，我知道一个工人党员在工厂里，一定要团结起周围的群众搞好生产，才算真正为人民服务。如果只有自己苦干而不团结群众，在生产上起的作用就很有限。去年“七一”以前，我在团结群众方面就搞的很不好，犯了脱离群众的错误。那时我看不起觉悟不够的工友，常说些“扣帽子”的话刺激人家，甚至对他们不理睬，觉得跟落后分子说话不值得。有时工友们无意识的说两句落后话，我不但不耐心给人家解释，反而插上嘴跟人家“抬杠”。工友给我提意见，我也不虚心接受，还认为人家的意见都不正确，总觉得自己比人家强。有时工友们对工会或者对行政有意见，我听到了既不向支部反映，也不帮助他们提上去请领导上研究；反说人家净为个人利益打算，不关心工厂。这样就引起了工友们对我不满。他们当面啥也不说，背后却叽叽咕咕，有时还故意刺激我：“人家是党员，真负责任，连天都能扛起来！”工友们生活思想的真实情况，我就别想知道一点。在这种僵局下，我的情绪也低落了，觉得工作不好搞。工友们在生产上有了错误，我也不敢说了！比方看到工友浪费材料，我心痛着急，可是我不说还好，越说就越浪费的厉害。
    问题已经这样严重，我还不知道从本身检查，一直认为是人家落后。去年五月里参加了市委干训班学习后，在党与同志们的帮助下，我才深深感到自己犯了脱离群众的错误。学习回来，我下了决心放包袱。回到厂里一上班时，因为跟大家离开很久，乍见面还有点浮情，彼此都问候一下，还有点热烘劲。我抓着这个机会向大家作了一次深刻的检讨，并且要求大家多给我提意见。工友们听了我检讨都高兴了，有的说：“你的缺点已说的很彻底，一下也想不起别的啦，今后我们看见你有毛病，一定给你提出来。”从此，我与工友们一天比一天的接近了！工友们有话都当面向我说，有意见也是诚恳的提出来。他们的意见正确，我就反映给支部或者负责转达给行政和工会；意见不对，也耐心地给他们解释。这样慢慢地我和大家在情感上就打下了基础。在这个基础上，我又用各种办法进行政策宣传。我不拘形式、不限时间，随时随地有机会就进行。接受了过去失败的教训，我知道给工友讲理论条文不行。因为理论条文工友们一下懂不了，因而也不爱听，讲久了还招工友们腻烦；有的工友还会觉得你是想露本事、出风头。我的办法是以闲聊天的方式，用真实的生动事例，联系工厂的实际情况来进行宣传。不管人多人少，只要有机会我就谈。谈话以前我一定要考虑自己说的话的作用；也一定考虑对方有些什么问题，需要听什么，然后决定谈什么和怎样谈。只要我发现了问题，谈一次不行谈两次、三次，一定要把对方的思想打通，到他彻底明白了为止。比方看到有的工友不爱学习，或者是学习中自馁泄气，我就用赵占魁、刘英源的故事跟他谈天。再如看到有的工友不知道节约，我就用拣煤碴的故事，和灾民挖野菜的故事跟他谈天。当他们听故事注了意，在思想上也有些认识的时候，我就把话拉回来联系他的具体问题，耐心的作对比解释。这样工友很容易感觉到自己的不对，并且会满意的接受给他提的意见。工友于作池说：“有不懂的事老赵给我们一谈就懂，同样的事有时听别人讲一大片，还是糊里糊涂，老赵一谈不但好懂，还教我们学会了好些事。”
    我还注意鼓励工友们提意见。当他们提出意见时，我先仔细考虑，认为正确的，还给他补充些理由教给他去提；对理由不充足的意见，耐心给他解释那儿的理由还不充足。有的工友说：“幸亏先跟你谈谈才知道这意见不好，不然提了出去还会被人家问的没话说呢，那就难看了。”我用这种宣传教育办法之后，遇到各种不同的问题有些已得到了解决。这个生产小组里，也有了相当的威信。工友们也都学会了注意和分析问题。在开会时过去不爱说话的工友，也敢提问题了。如李庆恒说：“咱们这小组真棒，各个人都敢提意见了。恐怕工会都感觉麻烦了。这都是老赵教给的。”工友在休息的时候，都愿意同我闲聊天。
    在生产及处理其他琐碎问题上，我也研究出了一些办法。我经常注意大家的工作和用材料。我发现了他们洗电滚用汽油一倒就是半脸盆。假如省着用一碗就够洗个小滚子。他们倒半盆用不完也糟蹋了。起初跟他们说要节约，但这是过去的习惯，一下子引不起大家的注意。此后我就把领来的油放起来，看见他们拆滚子要洗的时候，我像徒弟一样给倒在盆里侍候着，但倒的很少，用了不够时再给倒。这样慢慢就帮助大家养成了节约的习惯。现在用材料时大家都自动的注意节省了。在生产上我一面帮助生产组长，叫他有工作多跟大家商量，一面在谈话中给大家启发和鼓励。这样大家的劳动态度都好起来，并且都有了责任感，都能主动的出主意克服困难，不再故意找组长的麻烦了。
    工友有时在劳动纪律上犯点小错误，我就等他一个人的时候给他解释，帮助他认识错误，以免再犯。这样给他留了情面，他就容易接受意见认识错误了。到开检讨会时，他便会自动的检讨出来。工友们有了错误，我都是负责说服教育，而不是一点小事就向上级反映。但我一定负责把错误纠正。我经常注意工友们在工作中的积极性。只要有人在工作上有比平常好的地方，不管供献大小，我都及时报告给上级给他表扬。受到表扬的工友就特别高兴，感觉到现在真是一点好处也不会埋没的；而犯了过错时上级倒没有说。因此大家都愿意往好处干，并注意不犯错误了，觉得再犯错误就对不起党与人民了。要加强工友与工友之间的团结，不要使他们闹意见。发现谁对谁有意见，我就及时给他们解释开。对每个工友都同样看待，同样帮助，而不要有偏心。工友家里的琐事对我说了，我也耐心的帮助他研究办法，即不能解决也要尽到力量。现在我和工友们团结的就像亲弟兄一样。工友于作池说：“老赵你这人太好了，对大家都像亲哥们一样关心，对谁都一样帮助。就是亲哥们还没有这样注意呢。大家在一块痛快，干活也有劲。”
