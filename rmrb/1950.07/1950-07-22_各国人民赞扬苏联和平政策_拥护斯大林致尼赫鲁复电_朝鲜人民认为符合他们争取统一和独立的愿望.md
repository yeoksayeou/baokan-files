Xinhua News Agency, July 21st - Newspapers in Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic have all prominently published the reply telegram from Chairman Stalin of the Soviet Council of Ministers to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the 15th regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Many newspapers have also published editorials praising it.

Poland

	The Warsaw People's Tribune editorial stated: "Stalin's reply telegram points out the only path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." After pointing out that American imperialism is using the United Nations flag to mask its aggression, the newspaper emphasized: "The act of excluding the representatives of the 475 million strong Chinese people from the United Nations makes it impossible for representatives from the Soviet Union and the people's democracies to participate in the work of the United Nations." The Republic newspaper pointed out: Stalin's reply telegram is concise and clear, containing the principle of unanimous agreement among the five major powers, as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, for resolving international disputes. It includes all the necessary factors for a swift and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Romania

	Romania's Spark newspaper pointed out: The Soviet Union's brilliant leader, in just a few words, once again demonstrated the socialist countries' unwavering peaceful policy, the Soviet Union's consistent stance of safeguarding the autonomous rights of large and small nations, and the Soviet Union's firm position that the People's Republic of China must participate in the United Nations as a permanent member of the Security Council.

Czechoslovakia

	Czechoslovakia's Free Speech newspaper stated: "All of humanity constantly anticipates the speeches of Marshal Stalin. This latest speech once again proves that Marshal Stalin is the greatest and most trustworthy defender of mankind."

Germany

	The German Socialist Unity Party's organ, the New Germany newspaper, published an article on the 19th entitled "Truman Does Not Want Peace in Korea," praising the principles mentioned in Stalin's reply telegram to Nehru as fully in line with Article 32 of the United Nations Charter. The newspaper continued: "The American government's reaction to Nehru's proposal exposes the warmongers in Washington and most truthfully proves their war intentions."

Korea

	Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 21st - The Korean Workers' Party's organ, the Labor News, published an editorial on the 21st entitled "Korean People Warmly Support Marshal Stalin's Reply," stating: Marshal Stalin's reply telegram to Nehru regarding the proposal to localize and swiftly resolve the Korean conflict peacefully is not only another manifestation of Lenin and Stalin's foreign policy of safeguarding world peace and security, respecting the sovereignty of other nations, and advocating the resolution of all international issues through peaceful consultation; it also precisely conforms to the will of our Korean people to drive American imperialism out of our territory and complete the unification and independence of our motherland. Our Korean people have made the greatest efforts to avoid a civil war of internecine strife and strive for the peaceful unification of our motherland. We do not abandon this effort today either. We welcome the just method proposed in the exchange of telegrams between Marshal Stalin and Nehru to resolve the Korean incident. The Korean people believe that the United Nations Security Council must discuss the Korean issue in the presence of representatives from the great Soviet Union and New China, and with the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to achieve a just and effective resolution.

	The editorial continued to emphasize: Our Korean people welcome and support the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but this does not mean the slightest weakening of our fighting will. On the contrary, we are filled with the determination and will to fight to the end for just national liberation and world peace. The Korean people will never succumb to any threats or intimidation. The strength of the Korean people fighting for justice is limitless.

	The editorial concluded: The Korean people hope that the people of the world will support the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and hope that the United Nations organization, which is covering up the crimes of American imperialism's armed aggression against Korea and becoming its accomplice, will become a truly authoritative international institution that serves peace.

Britain

	Xinhua News Agency, July 21st - According to a Telepress dispatch from London on the 19th: The British people welcomed Stalin's reply telegram to Nehru and expressed indignation at the British government's rejection of the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Labor MP Davis called Stalin's reply telegram "a bright breath of fresh air, breaking through the foul mist that obscured reasonable measures for resolving the Korean issue. No government can find the slightest reason to reject this brilliant opportunity offered by Stalin." The Workers' Daily, in its editorial, condemned the British government's passive attitude, saying: "The United States is asking Britain and other countries' troops to expand the Korean War, while Stalin has put forward a path to peace. However, Attlee rejected the path to peace opened up by the initial exchange of views between Nehru and Stalin in Parliament. He obsequiously obeyed the orders of his dollar masters, stubbornly supporting the path of war."

	As of now, more than twenty Labor MPs still insist on their motion submitted in Parliament for discussion, demanding that the United States withdraw its troops from Taiwan and allow representatives of the Chinese People's Government to participate in the Security Council. However, the government is exerting all possible pressure and threats on these MPs, forcing them to withdraw their signatures.

　　各国人民赞扬苏联和平政策
    拥护斯大林致尼赫鲁复电         
    朝鲜人民认为符合他们争取统一和独立的愿望
    【新华社二十一日讯】波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国的报纸，均以显著地位，刊载苏联部长会议主席斯大林十五日致印度总理尼赫鲁的关于和平处理朝鲜问题的复电。许多报纸并发表社论，加以赞扬。
    波兰
    华沙人民论坛报社论称：“斯大林的复电指出了和平处理朝鲜问题的唯一途径。”该报在指出美帝国主义利用联合国旗帜以掩饰其侵略行为后，强调称：“把四万七千五百万强大的中国人民的代表摈斥于联合国之外的行动，使得苏联和各人民民主国家的代表不可能参加联合国的工作。”共和报指出：斯大林的复电简洁而明白，包含着联合国宪章所规定的五强一致协议解决国际纠纷的原则。它包括了迅速而和平地解决朝鲜问题所必需的一切因素。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚火花报指出：苏联天才的领袖用几句话，就再度表明了社会主义国家的坚定不移的和平政策，苏联维护大小民族自主权利的一贯立场，和苏联关于中华人民共和国必须以常任理事国的身份参加联合国的坚决主张。
    捷克
    捷克自由谈报称：“全体人类经常期待着斯大林大元帅的发言。他这一次的发言再度证明斯大林大元帅是人类最伟大与最可信赖的保卫者。”
    德国
    德国统一社会党机关报《新德意志报》于十九日以《杜鲁门不愿朝鲜有和平》为题，发表论文，赞扬斯大林复尼赫鲁电中所提到的原则，完全符合联合国宪章第三十二条。该报继称：“美国政府对尼赫鲁建议的反应，暴露了华盛顿战争挑拨者，并且最真实地证明了他们的战争意图。”
    朝鲜
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》，二十一日以《朝鲜人民热烈拥护斯大林大元帅的复函》为题，发表社论称：斯大林大元帅对尼赫鲁关于使朝鲜的冲突局部化并迅速予以和平解决的提议的复电，不仅是列宁、斯大林保卫世界和平安全，尊重他国民族主权，主张一切国际问题以和平协商的方式解决的对外政策的又一表现；同时亦正符合我们朝鲜人民把美帝国主义赶出我国领土，完成祖国统一与独立的意志。我们朝鲜人民为了避免同族相争的内战，争取祖国的和平统一，曾尽了最大的努力。我们今天也不放弃这种努力。我们欢迎以斯大林大元帅与尼赫鲁交换的电文中所提出的正当方法，来解决朝鲜的事变。朝鲜人民认为联合国安全理事会，必须在伟大的苏联和新中国代表的出席下，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表的参加下，讨论朝鲜问题，才能得到正当的、有效的解决。
    社论继强调指出：我们朝鲜人民欢迎和拥护以和平方法来解决朝鲜问题，但决不意味着我们斗争意志的丝毫削弱。相反，我们充满了为正义的民族解放与世界和平而斗争到底的决心和意志。朝鲜人民决不能为任何威胁与恐吓所屈服。为正义而战的朝鲜人民的力量是无穷的。
    社论最后指出：朝鲜人民希望全世界人民支持和平解决朝鲜问题的提议，希望掩盖着美帝国主义武装进攻朝鲜的罪行并成为其帮凶的联合国组织，变成真正为和平服务的、有权威的国际机构。
    英国
    【新华社二十一日讯】据电通社伦敦十九日讯：英国人民对斯大林致尼赫鲁的复电表示欢迎，而对英国政府拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题的建议表示愤慨。工党议员戴维斯把斯大林的复电称为“一股光辉的清新空气，冲破了掩蔽着解决朝鲜问题的合理措施的污浊迷雾。没有一个政府能找得出最细微的理由，足以拒绝斯大林提供的这个光辉的机会。”工人日报在其社论中斥责英国政府的消极态度说：“美国正要求英国和其他国家的军队来扩大朝鲜战争，而斯大林提出了和平的道路。但是，艾德礼却在议会里拒绝了尼赫鲁和斯大林初步交换意见所打开的和平道路。他奴颜婢膝地听从美元主人的号令，顽固地支持战争的道路。”
    截至目前为止，二十余名工党议员仍然坚持他们在议会提出待讨论的提案，要求美国军队撤离台湾，并允许中国人民政府的代表参加安全理事会。但是，政府正在对这些议员施以一切可能的压力和威胁，强迫他们撤消其签名。
