　　[Suzhou News] *New Suzhou News* reports: Since the Suzhou branch of the China Native Produce Company began operations, in addition to systematically purchasing native products such as rapeseed and straw mats and promoting goods, it has also vigorously organized the export of major native products in the area to earn foreign exchange. The company has specifically negotiated with the Shanghai East China Export Native Produce Company to act as an agent for another batch of lace. Last month, the Changshu office of the company, in cooperation with the local People's Government, entrusted the county's Supply and Marketing Cooperative to initially release 3,000 sets of lace for processing. It is estimated that this sub-processing will not only support the current production and disaster relief work, enabling 15,000 people to maintain a minimum daily living, but also initially open up export channels for the local lace products in the area. This also plays a significant role in promoting material exchange and organizing the export of native products.

　　To strengthen the work of purchasing and promoting native products, the company has continuously dispatched more than 40 cadres to the countryside, setting up purchase and sales teams in places such as Shaxi in Taicang, and Hushu, Mudu, Dongshan, and Xishan in Wuxian County. In addition to purchasing native products such as loquat and straw mats for export, they have also allocated large quantities of oil cake, fertilizer powder, and other fertilizers to meet the needs of farmers. Offices have been established and are already in operation in Changshu and Kunshan.

　　To coordinate the current cocoon collection work, stabilize prices, and protect the interests of silkworm farmers, in addition to combining with the cooperative to allocate a large quantity of fertilizer and daily necessities for farmers, in early June, the Shanghai Zhongzhi Company and Chemical Company shipped 140 tons of fertilizer powder and 5,000 pieces of soybean cake. Furthermore, 3,000 dan of small bean cake was transferred from Southern Jiangsu and distributed to various supply stations in the cocoon collection areas. In addition, a portion of the rapeseed purchased by the company has begun to be processed in Kunshan, Wujiang and other places, which will further enrich the supply of edible oil to the market in the future.

　　苏州土产公司组织土产外销
    委托加工花边三千套
    配合收茧供应农民肥料和日用品
    【苏州讯】新苏州报消息：中国土产公司苏州支公司自开始营业以来，除有计划的进行收购菜籽、草席等土产与推销货品外，并大力组织本区主要土产出口，争取外汇，该公司特与上海华东出口土产公司洽妥，为再代办花边一批。上月份已由该公司常熟办事处配合当地人民政府，委托该县供销合作总社首批代放加工花边三千套。通过上项代放加工，不但可以结合目前生产救灾工作，使一万五千人能维持一天最低的生活（据估计），同时亦为本区花边土产，初步打开外销出路。这对促使物资交流，组织土产外销也起着相当作用。
    该公司为加强土产收购与推销工作，曾连续调派干部四十余人下乡，分赴太仓沙溪、吴县浒关、木渎、东山、西山等地设立购销组，除收购枇杷、草席等土产组织外销外，并调拨大批油饼，肥田粉等肥料，供应农民的需要。并在常熟、昆山两地设立办事处，已开始营业。
    该公司为配合此次收茧工作，稳定物价，保障蚕农利益，除曾结合合作社拨运大批肥料及农民生活必需品外，六月初由上海中脂公司与化工公司运到肥田粉一四○吨，大豆饼五、○○○片，并由苏南调拨小豆饼三、○○○担，已分配到收茧地区的各供应站。又该公司所收购的一部菜籽，已开始在昆山、吴江等地加工，对今后市场的食油供应将会更见充裕。
