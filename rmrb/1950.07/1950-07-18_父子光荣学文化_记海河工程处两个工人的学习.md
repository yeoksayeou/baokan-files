　　Father and Son Glorified in Studying Culture
    ——A Record of Two Workers' Learning at the Haihe River Project
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

    In the first grade of Tianjin No. 107 Workers' Evening School, there is a student named Chen Wu, and in the third grade, there is a student named Chen Zhaohua. Chen Zhaohua is Chen Wu's son, and both father and son work at the Haihe River Project. More than a hundred of their workmates from the Haihe River Project attend the No. 107 Workers' Evening School, and many know the two men. When the results of the monthly exam were announced for the first time: father Chen Wu scored a hundred in Chinese and ninety-five in arithmetic; son Chen Zhaohua scored a hundred in arithmetic and ninety-one in Chinese. As a result, the beautiful story of their father and son glorifying in studying culture spread.

        (I) In the Past, Who Could Study Culture? Just Work Hard, No One Cared
    Father Chen Wu is forty-seven years old this year, with graying hair. He has worked on the Haihe River for a full thirty years. His son Chen Zhaohua is twenty-one, a sturdy young man, and has been working for eight years. Their family is from Tianjin County, and their ancestors lived by fishing. They toiled for generations, and never had enough money to send their children to school! Chen Wu started on the dredger at the Haihe River at the age of seventeen, starting as a handyman, then sailor, helmsman, and mate, step by step. He spent thirty years on the Haihe River, facing wind and waves, mastering the tides, wind direction, water flow, dredging, and ice breaking. With his skills, he earned the position of acting captain. But before Liberation, people always said he couldn't be a leader because he couldn't read. Chen Wu was indignant, so he saved money and sent Chen Zhaohua to school, hoping that his child would not suffer such oppression in the future. When the Japanese devils invaded, life became more and more difficult, and the family couldn't even afford to eat mixed noodles. Although Chen Zhaohua was doing well in primary school, Chen Wu had to harden his heart and send his son to work. Chen Zhaohua cried and refused to go, and Chen Wu told him, "Who told us we are poor? Poor people must accept their fate; we are not destined to study." Father and son had no hope and worked hard for eight years.

            (II) Now Liberated, We Are Masters, To Do Good Work We Must Study
    After Liberation, Chen Wu was promoted to official captain after democratic appraisal. He attended classes with everyone and understood the reasons for the workers' emancipation. Only then did he realize that there was no such thing as fate; in the past, workers were oppressed and exploited by the rich and had no status. Chen Wu thought it through, and worked even harder. He got up early and worked late every day, constantly thinking about the work on the ship. He believed that with his decades of experience, his ship would not lag behind others. But now, work requires democratic discussion, promoting everyone's initiative, and jointly formulating work plans and savings plans. Chen Wu didn't understand any of this. Moreover, he had to relay and arrange the principles and methods that the superiors talked about at trade union meetings and administrative meetings. He couldn't remember or write them down, which made him feel frustrated: he was a "leader," but how could he lead without culture! As soon as he heard that Tianjin City had opened a workers' evening school, he signed up and went to school with his satchel.

            (III) Study, Study, Sign to Support Peace!
    Studying is really not easy! Hands that have touched machines all their lives can't write properly with a pencil. Chen Wu would lie in bed at night and practice the strokes of the characters that the teacher taught. During the day, he would buy a box of chalk when he went to the ship and fill the deck with writing. He was old and easily forgot the characters he learned. In the past, he would cross the river home as soon as he got off work, and his wife, daughter-in-law, and little daughter would have the dishes and rice ready for him; now he had to study, so he could only eat dinner on the ship; if the meeting was late, he wouldn't even have time to eat before rushing there. Because learning was difficult, he would sometimes struggle with himself: "Is it better to cross the river (go home and not study), or is it better to learn to read?" After thinking about it, it was better to learn to read.

    Chen Wu learned for two months and recognized several hundred characters. When Tianjin launched the peace signature campaign, Chen Wu wrote his name for the first time, and he was so happy that he couldn't sleep all night. He thought that this signature would be shown to people all over the world, so let those imperialist war-mongers see the signature of Chen Wu, an old Chinese worker.

            (IV) Work, Work, Study Culture, Study Technology!
    Chen Zhaohua was quite different from his father. He hoped to become a radio engineer in the future. It turned out that because this young man had attended school for a few years and was smart, he was transferred to the radio repair department of the project after working for a few years. At first, he only did odd jobs, helping to hand things and wipe parts. When the radio repair staff was happy, they would also tell him the names of some parts. But he secretly paid attention to how to handle those parts. Sometimes he would also secretly look at books and magazines about radio. Sometimes he could understand some of the circuit diagrams, but he couldn't understand those damn English nouns and mathematical formulas. At this time, he remembered his father's words: "Poor people must accept their fate; we are not destined to study." So he had to put down those books.

    After Liberation, he saw more clearly than his father that a bright road had been opened for Chinese workers, and there was hope for a better life. The "Zhonghua" (China) ship where he worked won an award in the May competition; he and his workmates on the ship also proposed not to issue the usual half a bag of flour for the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival and the annual set of uniforms, and to use the saved money to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Other workers also responded enthusiastically. His desire to study also revived, and he happily bought many radio magazines and books, consulting the staff in the office and studying hard on his own. But for the second time, he was blocked by those unlucky English letters and mathematical formulas. The staff in the office told him: to learn technology, you must have a cultural foundation. Therefore, as soon as the workers' evening school enrolled students, he ran to sign up. In order to learn technology well, he also decided to learn English and entered an English tutoring school. This young man had a great enthusiasm for learning. Let's take a look at his daily schedule: from 7:00 to 8:00 in the morning, he studies politics, and from 8:00 to 12:00 he works; in the afternoon, he works from 1:00 to 5:00, and after work, he studies culture from 7:00 to 9:00, and tutors English from 9:00 to 11:00. He only has time to rest during the two meals from 12:00 to 1:00 and from 5:00 to 7:00, and he still has to seize the time to review his lessons. He rarely goes out on Sundays and spends all his time in the house fiddling with those radio parts or studying those radio books.

            (V) Master Science and Technology, Become a New Type of Intellectual!
    This young man thinks farther and better than his father. He had seen photos of the Soviet Union in the Cultural Palace, knowing that Soviet workers were literate and cultured, and many Stakhanovites improved their technology, improved production, and made great inventions; he had also heard the comrades of the Youth League say that many of the Soviet experts who came to China now were young workers after the October Revolution who had various specialized skills after studying; he had also heard the radio broadcast of the Minister of Education, saying that new China's workers should be trained to become a new type of intellectual; he also knew that there was a Chinese People's University in Beijing, where many workers were studying. In this way, he hoped that one day he would be able to master radio science and technology and become a radio engineering expert. He knew that in liberated China, as long as he worked hard, this ideal could be fully realized.

　　父子光荣学文化
    ——记海河工程处两个工人的学习
    本报记者  金凤
    在天津第一○七工人业余学校里，一年级有个学员叫做陈五，三年级有个学员叫做陈兆华。陈兆华是陈五的儿子，父子俩都在海河工程处干活。海河工程处有一百多位工友在第一○七工人业余学校上学，不少人都认识他父子俩个。第一次公布月考成绩：父亲陈五国语考了个一百分，算术考了九十五分；儿子陈兆华算术考了个一百分，国语考了九十一分。这一来，他父子俩光荣学文化的美谈就传开了。
        （一）过去那能学文化楞着头干没人问
    父亲陈五今年四十七岁，头发都花白了，在海河上整整干了三十年；儿子陈兆华今年二十一，是个结实的小伙子，也已经作了八年工。他家在天津县，祖上都是治鱼为生，苦累了几辈子，那里还拿得起钱送孩子上学！陈五从十七岁上了海河的挖泥船，从打杂的干起，水手、掌舵、大副一步步干下来。他在海河上摸了三十年，风里来、浪里去，潮大、潮小、风向、水流、挖泥、凿冰都摸得一清二楚，凭他的本领挣了个代理船长。可是在解放以前，人家总说他不认得字，当不了领头的。陈五气不过，就省吃俭用，送陈兆华上了学，希望孩子将来不再受这种压制。日本鬼子打进来了，日子一天天更加艰难起来，一家几口连杂合面也吃不上了。尽管陈兆华在小学里书念得挺好，陈五也不得不狠狠心送孩子上了工。陈兆华哭哭啼啼不肯去，陈五那时跟陈兆华说：“谁叫咱们是穷人，穷人就得认命，摸书本没有咱的福份”。父子俩啥也没盼头，楞着头干了八年。
            （二）如今解放当主人，做好工作要学习
    解放以后，经过民主评议，陈五升了正式船长。跟着大伙儿一块听课，懂得了工人翻身的道理。他这才明白没有什么命不命的，过去是受有钱人的压迫和剥削，工人们没有地位。陈五想通过来，干活就更上劲啦。每天起早摸黑，成天惦记着船上的工作。他相信凭着他这几十年的经验，他这条船不会比别人落后。可是如今搞工作还得民主讨论，发扬大伙的积极性，一起来订工作计划和节约计划，这一套陈五可不摸门儿。再说，他参加工会会议、行政会议，上级和他讲的那些道理和办法，都要他回去传达和布置。他可记又记不住，写又写不来，蹩得他一肚子闷气：自己大小是个“领导”，没有文化可怎么领导得起来！一听说天津市开办了工人业余学校，他就报了名，提上书包上学啦。
            （三）学习、学习，签名拥护和平！
    学习，可真不容易！摸了一辈子机器的手，拿起铅笔划来划去不叫话。陈五晚上回家睡在床上，都在心里学着先生写字的笔划。白天到船上去时买了一盒粉笔，在船板上写满了字。年纪大了，学了字老容易忘。往常一下班就过河回家，老婆、儿媳妇、小闺女热好了菜，盛好了饭等着他；如今要学习，只能在船上吃晚饭；碰上开会晚了，饭都顾不上吃就得赶去。因为学习有困难，脑袋里有时就打起架来了：“过河（回家不学了）好呢，还是识字好？”捉摸一下，还是识字好。
    陈五学了两个来月，认了好几百字。天津发起和平签名运动，陈五第一次写上了自己的名字，喜欢得一夜都睡不好。他想着这个签名是拿出去给全世界的人看的，那末，让那些帝国主义战争贩子们来看看中国老工人陈五的签名吧。
            （四）干活、干活，要学文化，要学技术！
    陈兆华却与父亲不大一样，他希望自己将来做一个无线电工程师。原来，这小伙子因为上过几年学，人又长得聪明，做了几年工就调到工程处修理无线电的部门了。开头只干个下手活，帮忙递递东西，擦擦零件。逢到管修无线电的职员高兴了，也跟他讲一些零件的名称。他却暗地里留心观看究竟怎么样来摆弄那些机件。有时也偷偷去看那些关于无线电的书本和杂志。有时那上面的线路图也看懂几分，但他再也看不懂那些该死的英文名词和一个个数学公式。他这时又记起了父亲的话：“穷人只得认命，摸书本没有咱的福份。”只得放下了那些书本。
    解放以后，他比父亲更清楚地看到在中国工人面前已经打开了一条光坦坦的大道，日子过得有指望啦。他所在的那条“中华号”，在五月竞赛中得了奖；他又和船上的工友一起发起不要每年照例发的端午和中秋的半袋面和每年一套的制服，节约的钱拿来支援解放军解放台湾，别的工友也都纷纷响应。他的学习的心思也活了起来，欢天喜地地去买了好些有关无线电的杂志和书本，一面请教处里的职员，一面自己用功苦修。只是他第二次又被那些倒霉的英文字母和数学公式碰了回来。处里的职员告诉他：学技术一定要有文化基础才行。所以，工人业余学校一招生，他就跑去报了名。为了学好技术，他还决心学英文，进了英文补习学校。这小伙子学习的劲儿可大，看一看他一天的生活课程表吧：早上七点到八点是政治学习，八点到十二点干活；下午一点到五点又干活，下班以后，七点到九点是文化学习，九点到十一点补习英文。一天只有十二点到一点，五点到七点两顿吃饭的时候才能歇一会儿，他可还要抓紧时间复习功课。星期天也难得出外，尽在屋子里拨弄那些无线电零件，或者啃着那些无线电的书本儿。
            （五）掌握科学技术，成为新型知识分子！
    这小伙子可比父亲想得远、想得好。他在文化宫看过苏联的照片，知道苏联的工人一个个识字有文化，许多斯塔哈诺夫工作者提高技术，改进生产，有了很大的发明；他又听过青年团的同志讲过，如今来到中国的那些苏联专家，有许多是十月革命后的青年工人，经过学习，有了各种的专门本领；他也听过无线电收音机里教育部长的广播演讲，说要培养新中国的工人成为新型知识分子；他也知道北京有个中国人民大学，里面有许多工人在上学。这样，他就指望着自己也有那么一天，能够掌握无线电科学技术，成为无线电工程专家。他知道在解放了的中国，只要他努力，这个理想是完全能够实现的。
