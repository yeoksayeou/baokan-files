　　Work Report of Qinghai Province
(Report at the 37th Political Affairs Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 26, 1950)
Qinghai Provincial People's Government Chairman Zhao Shoushan

    The Qinghai Provincial People's Government has been established for nearly half a year since New Year's Day. I will report on the work situation in the past half year as follows:

    I. First, I will talk about ethnic unity work: Since Qinghai has seven ethnic groups, we have attached importance to ethnic issues from the beginning, implemented the Common Program's ethnic policies, and respected the customs and religious freedom of minority ethnic groups. In January, we convened the "Qinghai Provincial Ethnic People's Friendship Association," which included all ethnic groups from all over the province, and conveyed the various policies of the Central People's Government. We made vigorous efforts to eliminate the ethnic divisions and prejudices caused by the reactionary ruling class in history, especially the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandit gangs. This has played a great role in the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and their connection with the government in the future. The conference also passed resolutions on the urgent issues to be resolved by the people of all ethnic groups regarding unity, public security, and trade. This enabled the people of all ethnic groups in the province to initially achieve ideological understanding and consistency in action on the important tasks of the government's current administration. After the meeting, representatives generally used various gatherings and opportunities to convey the spirit and resolutions of the meeting. General feedback indicates that in areas where representatives of the Ethnic Friendship Association participated, ethnic groups can generally live in harmony, and social order is relatively stable. After the delegate from Tongde County returned, 700 cattle carried sheep wool to Xining for sale at the county's Jiala Temple. This was a phenomenon that did not exist in the past. Furthermore, in government administration and mediation of disputes in various regions, attention was paid to taking care of ethnic unity and the interests of all ethnic groups. For example, the Hui and Han people in Heping Township and Gaozhai Township in Huzhu County had serious disputes in the past due to the instigation of Ma bandits, causing hostility and estrangement among some of the masses. After the local people's government mobilized the Hui and Han people to conduct self-criticism, each recognized the mistakes of past disunity and resolved to embrace the attitude of "resolving hatred without creating resentment" under the leadership of the people's government to achieve close unity. Now, the Hui and Han people in the two townships get along fundamentally differently than in the past. In the past, there was little contact and even fighting. Now, not only do they visit each other frequently, but they also invite each other to eat, drink tea, chat about their families, and help each other with difficulties. For example, during the spring plowing season, the two townships mutually adjusted and borrowed 100 shi of grain and voluntarily gave up a part of the paddy and dry land for adjustment. The dispute in Maoquangou, Guide County, where Tibetan people "overturned themselves" and drove away more than 300 Hui households, was resolved through consultation and mediation at the county's representative meeting. The Tibetan people realized that the Hui people were also oppressed by Ma Bufang in the past, and it was wrong to hate and drive away the Hui people. Both ethnic groups expressed that they would unite well in the future and not allow anyone to drive anyone away again. In the past, the Tibetan pastoral areas in Gaohongya area of the county were forcibly reclaimed by Ma bandits to recruit people to cultivate. After liberation, the Tibetan people wanted to drive away the "Xiangwa" (a general term for Ma bandit tenants in Tibetan language), and disputes occurred continuously. The Tibetan people demanded the return of the land for pasture, but the Hui and Han people believed that the ownership of the land should belong to the people's government, and the dispute continued. After the county people's government patiently persuaded and explained, it clarified that all ethnic groups should eliminate estrangement and unite as one, and the problem was solved ideologically from the Hui, Han, and Tibetan people. As a result, they all agreed that the ownership of the land belonged to the Tibetan people, and the right to cultivate still belonged to the "Xiangwa." In order to take care of the Tibetan people and the labor costs of the reclamation people, it was decided that the "Xiangwa" would pay a part of the rent to the Tibetan people, and the public grain would be handled in accordance with the collection regulations. There are many such examples, indicating that the meeting was basically successful. We believe that it is impossible to build Qinghai without the close unity of all ethnic groups. In the future, we must continue to resolutely implement the ethnic policies of the Common Program and further create more universal and consolidated ethnic unity, so that all our work can be done well.

    II. In terms of public security: The work of eliminating bandits and special agents has been successful through continued military suppression and political disintegration in the past half year. The organized large-scale bandits have been basically eliminated, and the social order in most areas is more stable than before. This has created the necessary conditions for mobilizing the masses to carry out democratic reforms in urban and rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, in the past four months (January-April), a total of 505 cases of robbery, assassination, theft, rape, abduction, etc. by bandits and special agents were solved (including 65 cases of bandit and special agent conspiracies to riot and robbery, and 214 bandits were captured), and 2,211 long and short guns, 50 machine guns, 2 60mm and 82mm cannons, 29,151 rounds of various bullets, and 186 horses were seized. 194 people were killed or wounded, and 1,060 bandits were politically won over. 730 main personnel of enemy party, league, and special agents, 431 enemy and puppet military officers, and 7,897 scattered soldiers were registered. In addition, people's security committees and security groups have been established in districts and townships in Xining, Huangzhong, and other ten cities and counties. These mass security organizations have played a certain role in protecting the interests of the masses and assisting the army in capturing bandits. After the provincial government issued the "Proclamation on Strengthening Public Security Work in Pastoral Areas" in pastoral areas, social order has also been more stable than before.

    Around early April, when our army began to carry out production, bandits and special agents once carried out extensive activities to create rumors and sabotage the reorganization and the anti-smoking decree. Wang Daoming and other reactionary elements in Ledu County incited and threatened the masses to plant opium, attempting to disrupt the production movement. The government has arrested and interrogated them. Even in Xining, special agents often fired guns to disturb the peace at night, and robbery cases occurred continuously, causing unease among the people. Therefore, we executed 15 of the most heinous elements who continued to sabotage in Xining, Huangzhong, Menyuan, Hualong, Minhe, and Ledu, etc. from April onwards. All of them were carried out after being approved by the Provincial Administrative Council and holding public trials by mass rallies. This not only cracked down on the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, but also educated the broad masses to more correctly understand the lenient policy and corrected some erroneous views that leniency meant not killing anyone. After such a combination of suppression, disintegration, and education, the activities of bandits and special agents have recently subsided, but it does not mean that they have been completely eliminated. We must still extensively and deeply mobilize the masses, strengthen investigation, punish the principal criminals, and strive to gradually achieve complete elimination.

    In addition, in order to summarize the past public security work, exchange experiences from various places, and convey the resolutions and spirit of the Northwest Public Security Conference, the province convened a joint conference of heads of public security bureaus of various counties and cities on May 11 to strengthen future public security work.

    III. Production and Disaster Relief Work: From last summer to autumn, varying degrees of hailstorms and floods occurred in various parts of Qinghai. 53 townships and 87 villages were affected, with an affected area of 203,383 mu and a population of 58,625. Most of the disaster areas were scattered in Huzhu, Huangzhong, Guide, Ledu, Menyuan, Datong, Huangyuan, Hualong, Gonghe, and other counties, with Gaozhai Township in Huzhu County being the most severely affected. Farmers in disaster areas generally lacked seeds and food grain. Based on this situation, the government organized effective disaster relief work. In accordance with the instructions of the Central Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and with reference to the actual situation in the province, it gave specific instructions to various counties, pointing out that governments at all levels should be responsible at each level to vigorously overcome the famine. It also put forward the slogan "Guarantee that no one starves to death," mobilized the masses, helped each other, made free loans, and rewarded "relatives helping relatives, neighbors helping neighbors," "non-disaster areas helping disaster areas," and "those with grain helping those without grain," striving to solve the problems of seeds and food grain and to overcome this year's famine. Generally speaking, because the leaders paid close attention to this work, and after repeated publicity and education to the masses, responsible comrades at all levels were able to go deep into the disaster areas and personally organize the masses to carry out production and disaster relief work. They also corrected the disaster victims' thoughts of waiting for relief and their pessimistic and despairing emotions, so that the policy of production for self-rescue could be basically implemented among the masses. At the same time, they repeatedly explained the policy of "free lending, guaranteeing repayment with principal and interest," dispelling the concerns of some wealthy people that "it's better not to lend, lending will lose even the principal," so that this work achieved results. According to statistics from ten counties and cities, more than 32,000 shi of grain have been lent out, plus more than 19,000 shi of grain from the charitable granaries, which can solve the seed problem for about 300,000 mu of land. Including those with half the seeds, it can solve the problem for about 150,000 to 200,000 people. This has encouraged the masses' production enthusiasm, and they have come up with many methods of intensive cultivation and transformation of lazy people to actively carry out production. In Ledu, Huzhu, Huangzhong, Datong, and other counties, labor exchange and mutual assistance were organized, greatly improving production efficiency. Although since the beginning of spring, some of the masses in Ledu, Minhe, Tongren, Xunhua, Tongde, Huangzhong, and other counties mistakenly believed the rumors of special agents: "The people want to turn over, so they should plant opium," and planted opium, they have been persuaded to eradicate it and replant crops. In developing sideline production, various places have organized coal mining, hunting, timber transportation, salt carrying, firewood cutting, gold panning, and other production according to local conditions. Xining and Datong have recently organized gold panning teams, pooled shares, and gone to various places to pan for gold, solving the difficulties of some farmers in eating grain and daily necessities and the lives of unemployed workers. In order to implement production and disaster relief work, the provincial government has successively dispatched seven work groups to various counties to inspect and assist in the work, and to cooperate in transforming grassroots power, investigating land debts, classifying classes, etc., to prepare for the rent reduction and debt clearing movement after the autumn harvest. At the same time, various agencies, schools, and troops actively participated in production and implemented the plan to save two liang of wheat per person per month (one liang for the troops). In the past four months, the troops have reclaimed more than 40,000 mu of wasteland and saved 400,000 jin of flour. Ledu, Guide, and other five counties have reorganized the charitable granaries that were previously controlled by landlords and rich peasants, recovering a total of 20,329 shi of grain. These have played a considerable role in production and disaster relief and overcoming financial difficulties. In terms of water conservancy construction, the province's larger Fanghui, Ping'an, Changsheng, and Gegong canals, in addition to borrowing 35,000,000 yuan in January for temporary repairs for utilization, also began to build more permanent projects in early April, which are expected to be completed before the mountain flood season. After the completion of all the projects, 49,000 mu of land can be irrigated, and 126,350 shi of grain can be increased annually. In general, because the leaders at all levels attach importance to this work, they have promptly corrected the biases in mutual aid and mutual assistance, such as forced lending, hard lending, and equal distribution, and the spring famine can basically be overcome smoothly. In the future, we must further mobilize the masses to improve farming methods and greatly develop production.

    In addition, the Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference of all ethnic groups was convened on April 21. This conference was convened on the basis of holding farmers' representative conferences in eleven counties and cities in the province's agricultural areas. The preparatory work was also relatively meticulous. The conference discussed issues such as production and disaster relief, rent reduction and debt clearing, eliminating bandits and special agents, and piloting land reform. In the accusation of Ma Bufang's cruel oppression of the peasants, the peasants' class consciousness was raised, the unity of the peasants of all ethnic groups was enhanced, and they unanimously responded to the Qinghai Provincial People's Government's call to increase grain production by 200,000 shi this year, expressing that as long as they follow the decided method, they have full confidence in completing the task. This meeting was basically successful.

    IV. Financial Work: Since the liberation of Qinghai, the financial work has been relatively chaotic due to the imperfect local political power and the incomplete elimination of bandits and special agents. During the military control period, the sub-districts were responsible by the division. Before the establishment of the provincial government, the relationship between the upper and lower levels was unclear. In order to implement the State Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work and to convey the spirit of the Northwest Financial and Economic Conference, to ensure the completion of the 1950 revenue and expenditure tasks, the first Qinghai Provincial Financial Conference was convened on April 11 to review and understand the financial and economic work since liberation and to discuss the preparation of various revenue and expenditure systems, as well as to exchange work experiences of various counties and cities and report on the financial work of various places. Through this meeting, the leadership relationship was clarified, changing the past phenomenon of disconnection between the upper and lower levels, establishing the idea of unified national finance, reviewing the past phenomena of extravagance and waste, corruption and enjoyment, lack of organization and discipline, and the errors of the "benevolent government" viewpoint of light taxation in some counties, and re-formulating the 1950 provincial revenue and expenditure budget. Compared with the original budget, revenue increased by 6.52% and expenditure decreased by 24.4%. The original deficit was 46.56%, and now the deficit is 18.76%, which is a reduction of 71.77% of the original deficit. It can be seen from this that the past budget was completely a crude and presumptuous bureaucratic calculation, and the new budget is relatively reliable. This meeting was relatively successful. The comrades who participated in the meeting improved in ideology and politics, and had great confidence in completing the task of the new budget. Moreover, it will have a greater improvement on Qinghai's financial work in the future. It is understood after the meeting that Huzhu, Datong, and other counties have resolutely implemented the decisions of the financial conference and have achieved results. The business tax in the first quarter of Huzhu County was originally tasked with 20,000 jin of wheat, and now it has successfully completed the task, paid it into the treasury, and exceeded the quota by 682 jin. After review in Datong County, the tax revenue in April alone exceeded 85% of the tax revenue in the previous three months. In the inventory of materials, in addition to the allocated number, another 43 horses were cleared out.

    Regarding the collection of public grain, the original task was 377,997 shi, and now nearly 300,000 shi have been put into the warehouse. It is estimated that 320,000 shi can be completed. However, the expenditure is based on the actual number of party, government, and military personnel in the province, which requires 408,900 shi of grain, which is still short of 88,700 shi. In addition to the part that Director Jia of the Northwest Financial Committee has instructed to solve, there is still a shortage of more than 35,473 shi, which needs to be allocated by the higher authorities.

    Tax revenue: The total task of business tax allocated in the first quarter of 1950 was 753,000 jin of wheat, of which 695,000 jin of wheat was for Xining, Huangzhong, and other seven counties and cities, equivalent to 660,250,000 yuan in local currency, accounting for 92.2% of the total task of the province. At present, Xining and other seven cities and counties have completed 697,217,660 yuan in local currency, exceeding the original allocated task by 36,967,660 yuan.

    The Victory Real Interest Public Bond sales distributed to the province were 40,000 shares, and now 49,063 shares have been completed. (In addition, 8,093.8 shares were sold in Yushu, equivalent to 312.5 bolts of Indian khaki cloth, which were not included because they could not be converted. How to convert them is to be decided.)

    In addition, the province's trade company, tax bureau, people's bank, and other agencies closely cooperated to implement the decision to unify national financial and economic work. With the stabilization of national prices and the beginning of the improvement of the financial situation, prices in Xining have gradually fallen (except for wool) and are moving towards stability. In the financial sector, bank deposits and remittances have greatly increased. Deposits have exceeded the task given by the head office. In addition to the 70,000 shares that should be submitted to the head office in May, an additional 3 billion yuan has been turned over. Currently, the largest transaction in Xining is wool. In March and April, the price of wool rose by 85.59%, which is beneficial to the lives of the people in pastoral areas. New wool will be on the market in July, and the trade company has transported a large number of people's necessities, preparing to accurately grasp prices and vigorously expand trade.

    V. Reorganization Work: In order to implement the decisions of the Central Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee on reorganization work, the Provincial Compilation and Examination Committee was organized to be responsible for the reorganization work. The provincial level began reorganization in early April and completed the reorganization at the end of the month. According to regulations, a total of 364 cadres were left over, accounting for 33.31% of the original personnel, and 409 odd-job personnel, accounting for 84.7% of the original personnel. The surplus cadres began to gather on April 24. There are still surplus personnel from various counties and cities who have not reported to the province, estimated to be 189. It is stipulated that they will begin to gather in early May. At present, a total of 116 people have reported to the province and counties. In carrying out this work, generally, mobilization was carried out first, leaders spoke, discussions were held, and the significance and methods of reorganization were clarified, and then reorganization was carried out. According to the preliminary understanding after the reorganization, the general work has not been affected, and the work efficiency has been improved to some extent. For example, the General Office of the Provincial Government originally had more than 200 people, but after the reorganization, there were only more than 50 people, and the work was still done very well. The disposal of surplus personnel is based on the instructions of the higher authorities, concentrating on learning, awaiting allocation, and training classes have been established and work teams are being prepared to go to the countryside to work.

    VI. Construction of Political Power: In combining the work of suppressing bandits and special agents, collecting grain, convening people's congresses in various counties, mobilizing farmers' congresses, and restoring production, we mobilized the masses to establish farmers' associations and security organizations, gradually destroyed the Baojia system, and adopted designated and elected methods to absorb a large number of activists from the peasants to participate in political power work, establishing rural grassroots people's political power. In areas where ethnic groups live in mixed communities, joint political power of all ethnic groups was established. In ethnic concentrated and remote pastoral areas, the old thousand and hundred households are still assigned to carry out the work. Tongren, Tongde, Xinghai, Dulan, and the seven counties of Yushu, Nangqian, and Chengduo under the jurisdiction of the Yushu Special Region, and the Qumalai Administration Bureau initially sent only one or two cadres or temporarily maintained the existing basis completely. Now the main backbone has been sent. The remaining Xining City and twelve counties such as Huangzhong have established and transformed 57 districts (accounting for 90.4% of the 65 districts) and 190 townships (accounting for 71.4% of the 226 townships). Among them, in Minhe, Gonghe, Hualong, and Xunhua counties, because there are still small groups of scattered bandits constantly harassing, some or all of the township governments have not been transformed. The masses in these four counties have not yet been mobilized and organized.

    Experience has proved that in the construction of political power (1) attention must be paid to taking care of ethnic issues; (2) a large number of minority ethnic cadres must be cultivated and promoted to participate in political power work; (3) in the early days of liberation, it is possible to use some old Baojia personnel, but they must be strictly controlled, otherwise corruption, commandism, favoritism towards landlords and rich peasants, and equal apportionment will occur.

    In areas where the rural political power has been preliminarily transformed, although the working people have participated in the political power work and are enthusiastic and passionate about the work, they often engage in hanging and beating people and violating policies in the work due to the lack of understanding of the policies and the influence of the work style of the Kuomintang Baojia personnel for many years. Therefore, strengthening the rolling training of rural cadres, convening joint conferences of district and township cadres, and establishing a patrol supervision and inspection system for the main cadres of the county districts to help educate them from actual work, improve their understanding, and improve their work is an important issue for transforming the rural political power well.

    Regarding the convening of people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in various counties and cities, all counties and cities in the province, except for Dulan, Xinghai, Tongde, and the counties of Yushu, Chengduo, Nangqian under the jurisdiction of Yushu Special Region, and the Qumalai Administration Bureau, Gangcha, and Henan two directly subordinate regions, either due to bandit harassment or due to lack of leading cadres, have not been convened. The remaining thirteen counties and cities such as Xining have generally held them once. Xining, Huzhu, Huangzhong, Ledu, Gonghe, and other counties and cities have held them twice. However, the convening time was delayed, and they failed to be convened according to the regulations of convening them once every three months. In the future, we should urge the counties to convene them on schedule to make it a regular system. The early convening of the people's representative conferences in various counties generally focused on issues such as social security and ethnic unity; the recent convocations have focused on production and disaster relief. These issues have been emphasized and discussed at each conference, and relatively satisfactory solutions have been obtained, and specific resolutions have been made. In the representative conferences in various places, representatives of all ethnic groups participated in a considerable number. In addition, we are preparing to convene a provincial people's representative conference of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in August to exercise the functions and powers of the provincial people's congress.

    Finally, Qinghai does not intend to implement land reform this year. Due to the limitations of the actual environment and the lack of preparation conditions, it is planned to vigorously carry out the rent reduction and debt clearing movement after the autumn harvest.

    In summary, the work of Qinghai in the past half year has achieved certain results due to the correct leadership of the Central Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the efforts of cadres at all levels, and the unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups in the province. However, due to the small number of our cadres and the lack of experience, we have also encountered many difficulties in our work and made some mistakes. We have corrected them in time or are correcting them. In the future, we must continue to strengthen the learning of cadres at all levels, so that they can continuously improve in politics, ideology, and business, better serve the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, unite with the broad masses, overcome all difficulties, and strive for the construction of a new Qinghai.

　　青海省工作报告
    （一九五零年六月二十六日在政务院第三十七次政务会议上的报告）
    青海省人民政府主席  赵寿山
    青海省人民政府自元旦日成立到现在将近半年了，我把这半年来的工作情况，作如下的报告：
    一、首先讲民族团结工作：由于青海有七种民族，开始我们就重视了民族问题和执行了共同纲领的民族政策，尊重少数民族的风俗习惯和宗教信仰自由。一月间我们召开了包括全省各地各族的“青海省各族人民联谊会”，传达了中央人民政府的各项政策，对于历史上反动统治阶级特别是蒋马匪帮所造成的民族隔阂与民族偏见，作了有力的消除工作。这对以后各族人民的团结和与政府的联系上，都起了很大作用。并在大会上通过了各族人民迫切需要解决的关于团结、治安、贸易三个问题的决议，这使全省各族人民在政府当前施政的重要工作上，初步获得思想认识和行动步调的一致。会后代表们一般的都利用各种集会和机会，把会议的精神和决议作了传达。一般反映，凡有参加民族联谊会代表的地方，各民族大都能团结相处，社会秩序也较安定。同德县的代回去后，该县加拉寺就有七百头牛驮羊毛到西宁来卖，这是过去没有的现象。再有各地区在施政上和调解纠纷上，也都注意照顾民族团结和各民族的利益，如互助县和平乡与高寨乡的回汉人民，过去由于马匪的挑拨，造成部分群众间的仇视隔阂等严重纠纷，经当地人民政府发动回汉人民双方作自我检讨，各自认识过去不团结的错误，决心在人民政府领导下抱“解仇不结恨”的态度，以达到亲密团结，现在两乡的回汉人民相处已和过去根本不同了。过去多不来往，甚至打架，现在不但经常来往，而且还招呼在家里吃饭、喝茶、叙家常、有了困难互相帮忙，像春耕时两乡就互相调剂借粮一百石，并各自自动让出水旱田一部作了调剂。贵德县毛全沟藏民“闹翻身”，赶走回民三百多户的纠纷，经该县在代表会上协商调解，藏民认识到回民过去也同样是受马步芳压迫的，仇视并赶走回民都是错误的，两族人民都表示了今后要好好团结，不许谁再赶走谁。该县高红崖一带藏民牧区，过去被马匪强迫开垦招人耕种，解放后藏民要把“向哇”（藏语马匪佃户统称）赶走，而不断发生纠纷，藏民要求索回土地仍作牧地，但回汉民认为该地所有权应归人民政府，争执不已，经该县人民政府耐心说服解释，说明各民族应消除隔阂团结一致，从回、汉、藏人民思想上解决了问题，结果都同意该地所有权归藏民，耕种权仍属“向哇”，并为照顾藏民及开垦人的劳动代价，决定由“向哇”给藏民出一部分租额，公粮按征收条例办理。此类事例很多，说明那个会议基本上是成功的。我们认为没有各民族的亲密团结，建设青海是不可能的。今后我们还要继续坚决执行共同纲领的民族政策，进一步造成更普遍的巩固的民族团结，我们的一切工作才可以做好。
    二、在治安方面：消灭土匪工作，经过半年来继续军事清剿和政治瓦解，是有成绩的。现在有组织的大股土匪基本上是消灭了，大部分地区社会秩序已较前安定，这样为发动群众进行城乡民主改革，造成了必要的条件。据不完全的统计，四个月（一——四月）来破获土匪特务抢劫、暗害、偷盗、强奸、拐骗等案共五○五件（内匪特阴谋暴动及抢劫案六十五件，捕获匪犯二一四人），缴获长短枪二、二一一枝，机枪五○挺，六○和八二炮各两门，各种子弹二九、一五一发，马一八六匹，毙伤一九四名，政治争取土匪来归者一、○六○名。登记敌党团特务主要人员七三○名，敌伪军官四三一名，散兵游勇七、八九七名。另外在西宁、湟中等十个市县，普遍地建立了区乡人民治安委员会和治安小组。这些群众性的治安组织，在保护群众利益和协助军队捕捉土匪上，起了一定的作用。游牧区在省府颁布了“关于加强游牧区治安工作的布告”后，社会秩序亦较前安定。
    四月上旬前后，当我军开始进行生产的时期，匪特一度大肆活动造谣，破坏整编及禁烟法令，乐都县王道明等反动分子，煽惑威胁群众种植鸦片，企图破坏生产运动，政府已予逮捕讯办。甚至在西宁，晚间亦常有特务鸣枪扰乱，连续发生抢案，人心不安。因此我们对于怙恶不悛继续破坏的首恶分子，从四月起先后在西宁、湟中、门源、化隆、民和、乐都等地，处决了十五人，都经过省行政会议通过和召开群众大会公审进行的，这不仅打击了反革命分子的活动，而且亦教育了广大群众更正确地认识了宽大政策，纠正了一些认为宽大就是一个人也不杀的错误看法。经过这样的镇压和分化争取教育相结合，匪特活动最近已趋消沉，但并不等于完全肃清了，仍必须广大深入地发动群众，加强调查，惩办首恶，争取胁从，逐渐做到彻底完全肃清。
    另外为了总结过去的治安工作，交流各地经验，及传达西北公安会议的决议和精神，省于五月十一日召开了各县市公安局长联席会议，以加强今后的治安工作。
    三、生产救灾工作：青海去年夏至秋，各地曾发生程度不同的雹灾与水灾，受灾地区有五十三个乡八十七个村，受灾地面积为二○三、三八三亩，受，灾人口为五八、六二五人，灾区大部分散在互助、湟中、贵德、乐都、门源、大通、湟源、化隆、共和等县，其中以互助县高寨乡灾情最重，灾区农民一般都缺乏籽种口粮。根据这种情况，政府组织了有效的救灾工作，遵照中央及西北军政委员会的指示，参照本省实际情况，对各县作了具体的指示，指出各级政府要逐级负责，以大力战胜灾荒，并提出“保证不饿死一个人”的口号，发动群众，互助互济，自由借贷，奖励“亲帮亲，邻帮邻”，“非灾区帮助灾区”，“有粮的帮助没粮的”，力求解决籽种口粮，度过今年的灾荒。一般的说，由于领导上对这一工作抓得比较紧，经过对群众反复地宣传教育，各级负责同志多能深入灾区，亲自动手，组织群众进行生产救灾工作，也纠正了灾民等待救济的思想和悲观失望的情绪，使生产自救的方针得以基本上贯彻到群众中去。同时反复说明“自由借贷、保证有借有还、有本有利”的政策，打消了部分富有者“不借还好、借了连本都瞎了”的顾虑，使这一工作获得了成绩。据十个县市的统计：已借出粮食三万二千多市石，加上义仓粮一万九千多市石，约可解决三十万亩地的籽种问题，连半有籽种者在内，约可解决十五万到二十万人的问题。这鼓舞了群众的生产情绪，想出许多精耕细作、改造懒汉的办法，积极进行生产。在乐都、互助、湟中、大通等县，组织变工互助，大大地提高了生产效率。虽然入春以来，在乐都、民和、同仁、循化、同德、湟中等县部分群众；在误信特务谣言：“人民要反身，就要种鸦片”，而种植了鸦片，但已经说服群众，加以铲除，改种庄稼。在发展副业生产上，各地都按当地不同情况，组织挖煤、打猎、运木、驮盐、砍柴、淘金等生产。西宁、大通最近又组织了淘金队，集股分赴各地淘金，解决了一些农民吃粮和日用品的困难和失业工人的生活。省府为贯彻生产救灾工作，曾先后派出七个工作组，分赴各县检查帮助工作，并配合改造基层政权，调查土地债务，阶级划分等情况，准备开展秋收后的减租清债运动。同时各机关、学校、部队均积极参加生产及实行每人每月节约小麦二两（部队一两）的计划。四个月来，部队已开荒四万多亩，节约面粉四十万斤，乐都、贵德等五县，整理了过去为地富所把持的义仓，共收回粮食二○、三二九市石。这些对生产救灾，克服财政困难，都起了相当的作用。在兴修水利上，本省较大的芳蕙、平安、长胜、阁公等渠，除于元月贷款三五、○○○、○○○元，作临时修补以便利用外，复于四月初着手修筑较永久的工程，预计均可在山洪期前竣工。全部完工后，可灌溉土地四九、○○○亩，每年可增产粮食一二六、三五○市石。总的来说，由于各级领导上重视这一工作，随时纠正了在互助互济上强借硬借、平均分配等偏向，春荒基本上已可顺利度过。今后还要更进一步发动群众改良农作法，大量发展生产。
    此外，于四月二十一日召开了省各族农民代表会议，这个会议是在全省农业区十一个县市开过农代会议的基础上召开的，事前准备工作也做的比较周密，在会上讨论了生产救灾、减租清债、清匪肃特和试办土改等问题。在控诉马匪步芳残酷压迫农民的罪行中，提高了农民的阶级觉悟，增进了各族农民的团结，并一致响应省人民政府关于今年全省增产粮食二十万市石的号召，都表示只要照着决定的办法去做，便有充分信心完成任务。这个会议基本上是成功的。
    四、财经工作：青海自解放以来，在地方政权尚未健全及匪特未完全肃清的情况下，财政工作比较混乱，军管期间，分区由师负责，省府成立前，上下领导关系不明确。为贯彻政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定及传达西北财经会议的精神，保证完成一九五○年收支任务，于四月十一日召开了青海省第一届财政会议，检讨了解放以来的财经工作和讨论了编制收支各种制度等问题，以及交流各县市工作经验，报告各地财政工作情况。经过这次会议，明确了领导关系，改变了过去上下脱节彼此无关的现象，建立了统一国家财经的思想，检讨了过去一些县份铺张浪费，贪污享乐，无组织无纪律的现象及轻税思想“仁政”观点的错误，并重新制定了一九五○年全省收支概算和原概算比较，收入增加了百分之六点五二，支出减少了百分之二四点四，原赤字为百分之四六点五六，现在赤字为百分之十八点七六，即减少了原赤字的百分之七一点七七。由此可见过去的概算完全是粗打冒算的官僚主义的，而新概算是比较可靠的。这次会议开得比较好，参加会议的同志，在思想上，政治上都提高了一步，对完成新概算的任务都具有很大信心，而且对青海今后的财政工作将会有较大的改善。会后据了解，互助、大通等县，坚决地执行了财政会议的决定，已获得成绩。互助县第一季营业税，原任务为两万斤小麦，现已胜利完成任务，缴齐入库，并超额六百八十二斤。大通县经过检讨，四月份一个月的税收即超过了前三个月税收的百分之八十五以上。在清理物资上除按编制数外，又清查出四十三匹马。
    关于征收公粮方面，原任务是三七七、九九七石，现在入仓近三十万石，估计可完成三十二万石，但支出按全省党政军实有人数，需粮四十万八千九百石，尚差八万八千七百石，除前经西北财委会贾主任指示解决一部外，尚缺三万五千四百七十三石余，需请上级拨助。
    税收方面：一九五○年一季度营业税任务分配总的为七五三、○○○斤小麦，西宁、湟中等七县市为六九五、○○○斤小麦，折合本币为六六○、二五○、○○○元，占全省总任务百分之九二点二。现西宁等七市县已完成本币六九七、二一七、六六○元，超过原配任务数三六、九六七、六六○元。
    胜利折实公债推销，分配本省为四万分，现已完成四万九千○六十三分。（另外尚有玉树售出八、○九三·八分合印度卡叽布三一二·五匹，因无法折合未计入，如何折合待决定。）
    另外，本省贸易公司税务局人民银行等机关，密切配合执行统一国家财经工作决定，随着全国物价的平稳和财政情况的开始好转，西宁物价亦逐步下跌（羊毛例外），走向稳定。金融方面，银行存款和汇兑款额大为增加，存款已超过总行所给任务，除五月份应交总行七万分已照交外，还额外上交了三十亿元，现西宁的大宗交易首推羊毛，三、四两个月中，羊毛价上涨了百分之八五点五九，这对牧区人民生活是有益的。七月间新毛即上市，贸易公司已运到大批人民必需品，准备正确掌握价格，大力展开贸易。
    五、整编工作：为执行中央及西北军政委员会关于整编工作的决定，组织了省编审委员会，负责整编工作，省级于四月初开始整编，月底整编完竣，按规定共编余干部三六四人，占原有人员百分之三三点三一，勤杂人员四○九人，占原有百分之八四点七，编余之干部于四月二十四开始集中，各县市编余人员尚有未报省者，估计有一百八九十人，规定于五月初开始集中，现省县共已报到一一六人。对于这一工作的进行，一般的都先进行了动员，首长讲话，展开讨论，搞清整编的意义与办法，然后进行整编。整编后据现在初步了解：一般的工作不但未受影响，而且工作效率还提高了一些，如省府秘书处原有二百余人，整编后只有五十余人，工作还是搞得很好。对编余人员的处理是根据上级指示，集中学习，听候分配，现已成立训练班和准备组织工作队下乡工作。
    六、建政工作：我们在结合剿匪肃特、征粮、各县召开人代会、农代会动员与恢复生产等各项工作中，发动群众建立农会，治安组织，逐步摧毁了保甲制度，采取指定和选举方式，吸收大批农民中的积极分子，参加政权工作，建立农村人民基层政权，在民族杂居的地区，建立了各族人民的联合政权，在民族聚居和偏僻的游牧区域，仍任旧千百户长执行工作，同仁、同德、兴海、都兰和玉树专区所辖的玉树、囊谦、称多等七县和曲麻莱设治局最初只派一两个干部或完全在旧有基础上暂时维持，现在已派去主要骨干。其余西宁市和湟中等十二个县已建立与改造了五十七个区（占六五个区的百分之九○·四），一百九十个乡（占二二六个乡百分之七一·四），其中民和、共和、化隆、循化四个县，因现在还有小股散匪不断骚扰，有的乡政权大部或全部未改造，这四个县的群众，基本还未发动组织起来。
    经验证明：在建政工作中（１）要注意照顾民族问题；（２）大量培养和提拔少数民族的干部，参加政权工作；（３）解放初期，使用部分旧保甲人员是可以的，但对他们必须严格掌握，否则便会发生贪污腐化，强迫命令，偏袒地富，平均摊派等问题。
    在乡村政权初步改造的地区，劳动人民虽已参加了政权工作，对工作也积极热情，但由于对政策缺乏了解，加以多年来受国民党保甲人员作风的影响，在工作中常发生吊打人违反政策的现象，因此，今后加强轮训乡村干部，召开区乡干部联席会议，建立县区主要干部的巡回督导检查制度，从实际工作中帮助教育他们，提高认识，改进工作，是改造好乡村政权的重要问题。
    关于召开各县市各族各界人民代表会议方面：全省除都兰、兴海、同德及玉树专区所辖的玉树、称多、囊谦等县及曲麻莱设治局、冈察、河南两直属区，或因有土匪骚扰，或因缺乏领导干部尚未召开，其余西宁等十三个县市，普遍地开过一次，西宁、互助、湟中、乐都、共和等县市，已开过第二次。但召开的时间都迟了些，未能按三个月召开一次的规定来开，今后当督促各县按期召开，使成为一种经常的制度。各县人代会议早开的一般都以社会治安、民族团结等问题为中心；最近开的都是以生产救灾为中心，在每次会上都着重地讨论了这些问题，获得较圆满的解决，并作出具体的决议案。在各地代表会中，各民族都有相当名额的代表参加。另外，我们准备于八月间召开省各族各界人民代表会议，代行省人民代表大会的职权。
    最后，青海本年不拟实行土改，因实际环境的限制和准备条件的不够成熟，拟于秋后先大力开展减租清债运动。
    总起来说，青海半年来的工作，由于中央和西北军政委员会的正确领导，各级干部的努力，全省各族人民的团结合作，获得了一定的成绩。但由于我们干部少，经验少，在工作中也遇到不少困难，同时犯了一些错误，我们已及时纠正或正在纠正中。今后，我们一定继续加强各级干部的学习，使在政治上思想上业务上不断提高，更好的为青海各族人民服务，和广大群众团结在一起，克服一切困难，为建设新青海而奋斗。
