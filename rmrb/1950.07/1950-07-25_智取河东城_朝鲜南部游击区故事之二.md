　　Wits Conquer Hedong City
    Story Two of the Guerrilla Zone in Southern Korea
    One day in the autumn of 1949, the puppet police guarding Hedong City saw a group of people approaching from afar. At the front were dozens of guerrillas in tattered clothes, some with their hands raised, some bound. Behind them followed a neat team of "ROK soldiers," driving American-style cars and holding American-style machine guns. The puppet police, seeing that it was a team returning with captured guerrillas, welcomed them into the police station and treated them cordially. The "ROK" commander who entered the city ordered the police station to assemble all the military and government leaders in the city for a meeting, and to execute the guerrillas on the spot. The puppet police, acting on orders, went out to invite guests. The puppet defense army officers stationed in Hedong City, the heads of the county government, landlords, and major despots all came to the meeting happily. Just as the meeting was in full swing, the "ROK" officer who entered the city suddenly gave an order, and the "ROK soldiers" pointed their guns at the reactionary elements who had come to the meeting. These puppet military officers, county government officials, despots, and secret agents were all dumbfounded, and only then did they realize that they had fallen into the net of the People's Guerrilla.

　　智取河东城
    朝鲜南部游击区故事之二
    一九四九年秋季的一天，河东城守卫的伪警察们，看见远远的来了一队人，前面走着几十个衣服褴褛的游击队，有的举着双手，有的被捆绑着，后面紧跟着一队整齐的“国军”，驾着美式汽车，持着美式机枪。伪警们一看是俘获游击队的队伍回来了，于是将他们整队欢迎入警察署，殷勤招待。进城的“国军”首长要警察署集全城的军政首长集会，当场枪毙游击队。伪警们奉令出动请客，驻河东城的伪国防军官们、县署的首要、大地主、大恶霸们都高高兴兴地来集会了。正在开会紧张的时候，进城“国军”的官长突然一声命令，“国军”用枪指住了来开会的反动分子。这些伪军官、县署官员、恶霸和特务们，一个个目瞪口呆，才知道落入了人民游击队的罗网了。
