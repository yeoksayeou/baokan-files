　　Feudal Exploitation Still Exists in Anbei, Suiyuan; Local People Demand Government Ban

Comrade Editor:
    The Anbei County in Suiyuan Province encompasses the territories of the East, West, and Central Gong Banners, and most of the Hangjin Banner. During the reactionary era, feudal landlords of the Mongolian banners used various unreasonable feudal systems to exploit the general populace. Since liberation, some people have continued to monopolize Mongolian taxes and practice severe feudal exploitation against the people, which has affected the development of production. For example, Guo Zixing contracted the water and grass fees for the entire Anbei territory of the West Gong Banner for 700 silver dollars, and then increased the levy, profiting more than 1,000 silver dollars. Li Yingsheng, the battalion commander of the West Gong Banner, insisted on collecting water and grass fees in silver dollars this spring. If people paid in Renminbi, he forcibly converted it at a high price of 25,000 yuan per dollar. These feudal exploitation systems that violate policy should not be allowed to continue to exist today. Recently, after understanding the policies of the People's Government, the masses have been demanding that they be banned. This demand is correct and reasonable. Therefore, I am reporting this to you, requesting that the government immediately take measures to stop it in order to protect the legitimate interests of the people.

　　绥远安北仍有封建剥削  当地群众要求政府取缔编辑同志：
    绥远安北县辖境，有东、西、中公旗和杭锦旗的大部领地。在反动时代蒙旗封建地主曾沿用各种不合理的封建制度剥削一般人民。解放以来，依然有人包揽蒙税，对人民实行严重的封建剥削。影响了生产的发展。如郭子兴以七百银元包下西公旗在安北全境的水草费后，便加重征收，获利一千多银元；西公旗营长李英胜今春征收水草费非要白洋不可，若交人民币，就强以高价二万五千元折合一元。这些违反政策的封建剥削制度，今天该是不允许继续存在的。群众近来了解了人民政府的政策后，纷纷要求予以取缔。这种要求是正确合理的，所以向你们反映，请求政府为了保护人民正当利益，立即设法制止。
