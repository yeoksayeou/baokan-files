Hongxingde Grain Store and Yuehua Bookbinding Shop

Improve Labor-Management Relations and Work Together to Continue Operations

[This Newspaper’s Report] In the process of private industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing jointly overcoming difficulties through labor-management consultation, it was discovered that some factories and shops, such as Hongxingde Grain Store and Yuehua Bookbinding Shop, had suffered losses in their operations due to a lack of understanding of the policy of mutual benefit for labor and management by both sides. The management had ideological concerns, and the labor side did not focus on improving production. After mediation by the Municipal Labor Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Adjustment Working Group, the issues have been correctly resolved. Hongxingde Grain Store had a capital of 20,000 jin of wheat at the beginning of liberation. Due to profitable business, it increased to more than 50,000 jin of wheat in May of the same year. However, because the management was from a landlord background, they always had the idea of "being afraid that the employees would divide up the business" and accommodated the employees' demands in every way. The labor side, also due to a lack of understanding of the policy of mutual benefit for labor and management, only saw immediate benefits and proposed a "profit-sharing" method in May of last year. With the management's consent, all employees shared more than 30,000 jin of wheat. Both labor and management agreed that "profit-sharing" would be done once every four months thereafter. Tang Yumo, a counter clerk in the store, severely violated labor discipline twice last year: once by privately moving some furniture from the store to his home; and once by conspiring with two other employees to embezzle store funds to hoard 4,000 jin of rice. Although Tang Yumo was an employee in charge of counter affairs, he was not responsible enough in his work, and the store's labor discipline was very lax. For example, when a shop apprentice got married last year, all employees went to attend the wedding, leaving the store's business unattended. During the Spring Festival this year, employees gambled for more than ten days. The store made a net profit of 1,178 bags of flour last year. In addition to the "profit-sharing" in May of last year, there was a higher gift-giving at the end of the year, which consumed 72 percent of the net profit, making it impossible to accumulate capital. As a result, the management had no intention of continuing operations. In March and April of this year, the management privately dismissed some employees and planned to apply for closure. Because the remaining employees did not agree, a dispute arose between the two sides. After mediation by the Industrial and Commercial Adjustment Working Group and the Labor Bureau, the management has dispelled ideological concerns and is willing to continue investing in operations. The labor side also realized that the past practice of "profit-sharing" was wrong. The management proposed the dismissal of Tang Yumo. After investigation by the working group and the Labor Bureau, it was confirmed that he had violated labor discipline and should be dismissed. Now, after formulating a new business plan, the store has resumed business.

Yuehua Bookbinding Shop is a manual bookbinding factory with 36 employees. The relationship between labor and management was generally normal. The workers' wages were not low. In November of last year, after the workers proposed and the management agreed to increase the wages of female workers, the expenses increased, and coincidentally, the binding work decreased that month, resulting in a loss of more than 2,000 jin of millet in half a month, which affected continued production. Therefore, a discussion on how to overcome difficulties was launched among the employees. A few technicians, because they did not believe that the management would lose money, and mistakenly believed that mutual benefit for labor and management was impossible under the management's operation and management, put forward the wrong idea of ​​the workers taking over the factory. Most of the female workers did not agree with this at first, but under the insistence of the technicians, they finally reluctantly agreed. The former cadre of the Ninth District Federation of Trade Unions explained to the employees that this was a violation of policy, but because of the one-sided reason of "not being able to excessively打击工人的情绪,” they did not resolutely stop it. The management also did not understand the meaning of mutual benefit for labor and management, and signed a so-called "Labor-Management Mutual Benefit Regulations" with the workers in December of last year. All business in the factory was managed by the labor side, and the management was given 25 percent of the total income and 20 percent of the paper scraps each month. The District Federation of Trade Unions did not correct it in time after learning about it. Until May of this year, the factory was losing money and unable to pay wages, and labor discipline was lax. The District Federation of Trade Unions sent someone to the factory to mobilize the workers to voluntarily propose returning the factory to the management. However, the management refused to accept it on the grounds that "the factory lost money" and that they were ill and unable to take care of it, forming a labor dispute. Later, after the Labor Bureau repeatedly explained the policies of the People's Government to the management and dispelled their ideological concerns, the management agreed to take over the factory. Both parties signed a temporary agreement. In order to take care of the management's difficulties after taking over, in addition to guaranteeing to abide by labor discipline in the future, the employees are also willing to lower their wages and temporarily change the male workers to daily workers. The bureau is now on the path of normal production. (Lin Hong)

　　鸿兴德粮店、粤华订书局
    劳资关系改善  协力继续经营
    【本报讯】在京市私营工商业劳资协商共度困难的过程中，发现鸿兴德粮店和粤华订书局等部分工厂商店，因劳资双方不了解劳资两利政策，资方思想有顾虑，劳方又未着重搞好生产，致使经营遭受损失。经市劳动局和调整工商业工作小组调解后，已经正确地解决。鸿兴德粮店在解放初期有资金两万斤小麦，因营业获利，同年五月，增至五万余斤小麦。但因资方出身地主，始终存在着“怕职工分买卖”的思想，对职工的要求便处处迁就；而劳方也因不了解劳资两利政策，只看到眼前利益，于去年五月提出“分红”办法，经资方同意后，全店人员共分了三万多斤小麦。劳资双方并同意，以后每四月“分红”一次。该店坐柜店员唐与谟去年曾两次严重违犯劳动纪律：一次是私将店内部分家具搬到自己家中；一次是与另外两个职员合伙，私自挪用店内资金，囤积大米四千斤。唐与谟虽是管理柜内事务的职员，但因对工作不够负责，该店平日劳动纪律甚为松弛。如去年店内某学徒结婚，职工全去参加婚礼，以致店内业务无人照管；今年春节，职工又赌博十余日。该店去年共获纯利一千一百七十八袋面粉，除去年五月“分红”外，年底又有一次较高的馈送，共耗去纯利的百分之七十二，致使资金无法积累。因而资方无意继续经营，至今年三、四月，资方私下将部分职工解雇，打算申请歇业。因其余职工不同意，双方发生争执。后经调整工商业工作组和劳动局调解，资方已打消思想顾虑，愿意继续投资经营；劳方也认识到过去的“分红”的作法是不对的。资方提出解雇唐与谟的意见，经工作组与劳动局调查后，确系违犯劳动纪律，应予以开除处分。现该店在拟定新的业务计划后，已恢复营业。
    粤华订书局是一家手工装订工厂，共有职工三十六人。平日劳资间的关系尚称正常。工人的工资也不算低。去年十一月间，工人提出经资方同意增加女工工资后，因支出增大，和碰巧该月装订活减少，结果在半月内赔了两千多斤小米，影响了继续生产。于是，在职工中间便展开了如何克服困难的讨论。少数技工因不相信资方会赔本，且平日就错误地认为，在资方的经营管理下，就不可能作到劳资两利，便提出了由工人接办工厂的错误意见。多数女工原不赞成这样作，但在技工的坚持下，终于勉强同意了。原九区工会办事处干部曾向职工说明，这是违犯政策的，但因片面地以“不能过分打击工人的情绪”为理由，而未坚决制止。资方也因不明白劳资两利的意义，于去年十二月与工人签订了所谓“劳资两利规章”，厂内业务全由劳方掌管，每月按总收入的百分之二十五和纸边二成提给资方。区工会得知后亦未能及时纠正。直到今年五月，该厂赔累不堪，工资不能照发，劳动纪律废弛，该区工会办事处才派人去厂，动员工人自动提出将工厂交回资方；但资方因“工厂赔钱”后又交给我，和自身有病不能照管为理由，坚不接受，形成劳资争议。后经劳动局反复向资方说明人民政府的政策，解除其思想顾虑后，资方才同意接管工厂。双方并签订了临时协议。职工为了照顾资方接管后的困难，除保证今后遵守劳动纪律外，并愿降低工资，将男工暂改为日工。现该局已走上正常生产途径。（林洪）
