　　First District People's Representative Conference Closes
    Meeting Approves Proposals to Establish a Housing Repair and Protection Committee, Sends Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Beijing News Agency: The First District People's Representative Conference successfully concluded at 7:00 PM on June 30th. During the meeting on the 30th, the results of the Presidium's review of all opinions raised by the district representatives and the people were discussed and approved, including five categories: housing issues, sanitation construction, culture and education, politics and law, and commerce and industry. Four telegrams were also approved, namely, a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, a telegram of greetings to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, a telegram supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and a telegram defending world peace. On the second day of the meeting, proposals to establish a Housing Repair and Protection Committee and to establish a sanitation pact were discussed and approved, and the "Beijing First District Housing Repair Trial Measures" were discussed and approved.
    The 30th was the third day of the meeting. The meeting focused on examining the work style and discipline of government staff. A total of 142 opinions were received regarding the examination of the work style of government staff, mainly exposing cadres' bureaucracy, commandism, and other behaviors that separated them from the masses. Su Jie, District Head of the First District, and Zhao Lian, Director of the Neiyi Public Security Branch Bureau, reported on behalf of the Presidium on the results of reviewing these opinions, believing that most of these opinions were correct. Because many of the current government staff joined the revolution not long ago, these cadres have high enthusiasm for work but lack experience, and they are prone to making the mistake of commandism when they are eager to achieve results in their work. He expressed on behalf of the district office and the public security branch bureau that they sincerely accept the opinions raised by the representatives. He also reported on the situation of conducting education and examining ideology among cadres in the past month after receiving the opinions. District Head Su Jie made a self-criticism, saying: The continuous occurrence of such things is mainly because the responsible cadres of various departments of the district office do not thoroughly examine their work, do not listen to the opinions of the masses, and do not provide enough help and education to the cadres. In the future, in order to do a better job, he asked the representatives and the vast number of people in the district to offer more opinions to help all staff members correct their shortcomings and also to help themselves thoroughly eliminate the bureaucratic work style. In group discussions and general speeches at the meeting, the representatives expressed satisfaction with the results of the proposal review and the self-criticism of government staff. The representatives also expressed that they would convey the meeting's resolutions on housing repair and sanitation pacts to the masses and assist the government in implementing them.

　　一区各界人民代表会议闭幕
    会议通过组织房屋修缮保护委员会等提案并电毛主席致敬
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：一区各界人民代表会议已于六月三十日晚七时胜利闭幕。三十日会中讨论通过了主席团关于区代表及人民所提全部意见的审查结果，其中包括房屋问题，卫生建设、文化教育、政法、工商等五类。并通过了向毛主席致敬、慰问人民解放军全体指战员、拥护周外长声明及保卫世界和平等四个电文。会议第二日曾讨论通过了组织房屋修缮保护委员会和订立卫生公约二提案，并讨论通过了“北京市第一区房屋修缮试行办法”。
    三十日为会议之第三日，会上着重于检查政府工作人员的工作作风和纪律。总计收到关于检查政府工作人员作风的意见共一百四十二件，主要是检举干部的官僚主义、强迫命令等脱离群众的行为。第一区区长苏捷和内一公安分局局长赵濂分别代表主席团报告审查这些意见的结果，认为这些意见大多数是对的。因为现在政府工作人员中有很多是参加革命不久的，这些干部的工作热情高而经验少，工作时急于求成易犯强迫命令的毛病。他代表区公所和公安分局表示诚恳接受代表们所提意见。他并报告了接到意见后，一个月来在干部中进行教育和检查思想的情况。苏捷区长检讨说：这类事情的不断发生，主要原因是区公所各部门的负责干部不深入地检查工作，又未听取群众意见，及对干部的帮助和教育做得不够。今后，为了把工作做得更好，要求代表们和区内广大人民多提意见，帮助全体工作人员改正缺点，也帮助自己彻底清除官僚主义作风。与会代表们在小组讨论和大会发言中，对提案审查结果及政府工作人员的自我批评表示满意。代表们并都表示对会议关于修缮房屋和卫生公约的决议案，将很好地向群众传达并协助政府贯彻执行。
