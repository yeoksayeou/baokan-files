　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th: After liberation, rural women in Guangdong Province have carried forward their glorious revolutionary traditions and actively participated in labor production and social reform movements.
　　The vast majority of rural women in Guangdong Province have participated in labor since childhood and are able to bear the main labor in production, but like women across the country, they have long been in a position of oppressed slavery. Therefore, they are very active in participating in revolutionary struggles. Wherever the revolution develops, women from that village participate. For example, Li Liying, a 64-year-old representative from the Chaoshan area, known as the "revolutionary mother" by the people, personally participated in the Great Revolution movement from 1925 to 1927. After the failure of the Great Revolution, she encouraged her four sons and one son-in-law to go to the mountains to fight guerrillas; all four sons gloriously sacrificed themselves, and she persisted in helping the revolutionary work under various difficult circumstances until victory. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, there were many heroic deeds of women who were unyielding under the cruel destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Outstanding figures such as Zhang Laidi from the Dongjiang District, Wu Shijiao from the Zhujiang District, and Huang Jiezhen from the Beijiang District have all made contributions in the struggle and have been elected as members of the preparatory committee of the Provincial Women's Federation. Before and after liberation, women made great contributions to supporting the front lines. For example, 6,000 women in Lianjiang County organized to participate in supporting the front. Women in two villages in the eastern district of Suixi County washed more than 20,000 military tents and more clothes for the army in two months. They milled more than 2,000 catties of rice in one night. Women mobilized their husbands and sons to participate in the cross-sea battle, and many fishing women participated in the cross-sea battle. Among the representatives of this Provincial Women's Congress, there is a female hero who made meritorious service in the cross-sea battle.
　　With these glorious revolutionary histories, rural women in Guangdong Province, under the call of the People's Government and the Communist Party after liberation, actively participated in production. For example, rural women in the Chaoshan area, who rarely participated in major labor in the past, also responded to the call for wasteland reclamation this spring, and most of them participated in production. The women's association in Qiudong District, Chao'an County, reclaimed 3,000 mu of wasteland, of which Xikou village alone reclaimed 400 mu. The director of the women's federation in Baidu District, Meixian County, led more than 80 women to take the lead in reclaiming more than 400 mu of wasteland, which greatly enhanced the confidence of farmers in the district and promoted the production movement in the entire district. In terms of flood prevention and dike repair, women aged 16 to 45 in Jiangxi and Yuezhong participated in the dike repair and rescue teams, day and night, regardless of distance. Wherever there was danger, they rushed to repair it and fought floods alongside male workers. Women accounted for 70% of the dike repair workers in Sanshui County. Liang Sima, who was selected as a model, carried 239 loads of mud a day, only one load less than the highest record of male workers. A woman participated in pile driving with male workers. In the allotted time, others averaged eight or nine piles, but she drove twenty-four. Cheng Mei from Southwest Town carried mud quickly and in large quantities. While others took turns to rest, she carried mud for twenty consecutive days and was awarded the title of dike-building hero.
　　In the struggle against local bullies and rent reduction, women also played an important role. They bravely stood up to reason with landlords and settle accounts, exposing landlords' conspiracies to pretend to be poor, intimidate, and sabotage. Women generally took the lead in complaining about their suffering. When fighting the big local bully Liu Wenxuan in Xingmei District, more than 20 women came forward to accuse him. When fighting the big local bully Zhou Chun in the Zhujiang District, a woman took the lead in accusing him of killing her son and destroying his body, which motivated other victims to accuse him.
　　At present, the political consciousness of women in Guangdong has been rapidly improved, and many areas have seen female village chiefs. The organization of women's federations and literacy classes are also developing rapidly.

    在支援前线、生产、防汛、反恶霸和退租斗争中涌现了大批妇女英雄和模范
    【新华社广州十二日电】广东农村妇女解放后发扬光荣的革命传统，积极参加劳动生产和社会改革运动。
    广东农村妇女绝大部分都是自小参加劳动，并且能负担生产中的主要劳动，但是她们和全国妇女一样，长期处于被压迫的奴隶地位，因此，她们参加革命斗争非常积极，革命发展到那村，就有那村的妇女参加。例如这次全省妇代会中一位被潮汕人民称为“革命母亲”的六十四岁的代表李梨英，就亲身参加过一九二五至一九二七年的大革命运动。大革命失败后，她鼓励自己的四个儿子、一个女婿上山打游击；四个儿子都光荣牺牲了，而她在各种困难环境下帮助革命工作一直坚持到胜利。在抗日战争、解放战争中，妇女们在国民党反动派残酷摧残下，不屈不挠的英勇事例极多。其中的优秀人物如东江区的张来娣、珠江区的吴石娇、北江区的黄洁珍等，都曾在斗争中立功，她们已都被选举为省妇联筹备会的委员。解放前后，妇女们在支援前线的工作上有很大贡献。例如廉江县有六千妇女组织起来参加支前工作。遂溪县东区两个村的妇女，在两个月内替军队洗帐子两万多顶以及更多的衣服。她们在一个晚上就碾好二千斤大米。妇女们动员丈夫、儿子参加渡海作战，并有不少渔妇参加了渡海作战。此次省妇代会的代表中，就有一位渡海立功的女英雄。
    具有这些光荣革命历史的广东农村妇女，在解放后就又在人民政府和共产党的号召下，积极参加生产。例如过去很少参加主要劳动的潮汕专区农村妇女，今春也响应了开荒生产的号召，大部分都参加了生产。潮安县秋东区妇女会三千妇女开荒三千亩，其中溪口一个村便开了四百亩。梅县白渡区的妇联会主任领导八十多个妇女带头开了四百多亩荒地，大大提高了该区农民的信心，推进了全区的生产运动。在防洪修堤工作方面，江西、粤中两地十六岁到四十五岁的妇女都参加了修堤抢险队，不分昼夜，不分远近，那里有险就抢修到那里，和男工并肩跟洪水作战。三水县修堤的民工中，妇女占百分之七十，被选为模范的梁四妹一天挑泥二百三十九担，比男工最高纪录仅差一担。一个妇女参加男工打桩，在预定时间内，别人平均打桩八、九条，她打了二十四条。西南镇的程妹挑泥挑的又多又快，别人轮班休息，她却一连挑了二十天，获得筑堤英雄的称号。
    在反对恶霸和退租斗争中，妇女们也起了重要作用。她们勇敢地起来向地主讲理算账，揭破地主装穷、威吓、破坏等阴谋。妇女们普遍带头诉苦。兴梅区斗争大恶霸刘文轩时，二十多个妇女出头控诉。珠江区斗争大恶霸周纯时，一个妇女带头控诉她的儿子被杀灭尸的惨况，带动其他苦主群起控诉。
    目前广东妇女的政治觉悟已迅速提高，许多地区出现了女村长。妇联会的组织和识字班工作等也在迅速开展中。
