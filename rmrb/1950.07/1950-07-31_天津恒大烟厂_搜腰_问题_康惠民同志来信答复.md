　　Tianjin Hengda Cigarette Factory "Body Search" Issue
    Comrade Kang Huimin's Letter of Reply

    To the Editors:
    I agree with the criticism of our factory's "body search" system made by reader Qiu Jing in your newspaper on July 21st, and with your editor's note. Based on the principle of relying on and trusting the workers, we abolished the long-standing "body search" system on March 1st of this year, and on April 7th, we also abolished the "body search" system for temporary production workers. In order to protect the people's property from loss, while also respecting the personality and awareness of our worker brothers and sisters, and to unleash their initiative and enthusiasm, we had been considering abolishing this unreasonable system since shortly after liberation. After careful and thorough mobilization, and broad discussions, all factory employees voluntarily proposed mass supervision, unanimously guaranteeing that nothing would be lost in the future; and voluntarily formulated measures for dealing with violations of labor discipline. We abolished the "body search" system in batches under these principles and steps.
    The warehouse is an affiliated department of our factory, employing a small number of loaders, some of whom are temporary workers (paid on a daily basis, with their employment decided at any time according to their own willingness and the factory's needs). Our factory has already abolished the "body search" system for nearly nine hundred long-term and temporary workers, but we overlooked the small number of temporary workers in this affiliated department and have not yet abolished it. This is due to our factory leadership's carelessness and bureaucracy. Our leadership should conduct a deep self-examination and correct this.

### 天津恒大烟厂“搜腰”问题  康惠民同志来信答复

　　天津恒大烟厂“搜腰”问题
    康惠民同志来信答复编辑同志：
    七月二十一日贵报读者邱靖同志对本厂“搜腰”制度的批评和你们的按语，我表示同意。我们根据依靠工人信任工人的原则，把历来遗留下来的“搜腰”制度于今年三月一日取消，并在四月七日又取消了生产临时工的“搜腰”制度。为了保障人民的财产不使有所损失，同时又要尊重工人兄弟们的人格与觉悟，以发挥他们的自动性与积极性，我们早在解放以后不久，就酝酿取消这种不合理的制度。经过慎重深入的动员，广泛的讨论，全厂职工自动提出群众性的监督，一致保证今后不会丢失东西；并自动订出违犯劳动纪律的处理办法。我们是在这样的原则与步骤下把“搜腰”制度分批取消的。
    仓库是本厂的附属部门，用有少数搬运工人，其中有一些临时工（以日计算工资，根据本人的自愿与本厂的需要随时决定去留）。本厂将近九百人的长工、临时工都已取消，只忽略了这一附属部门的少数临时工，至今尚未取消。这是我们工厂领导上的粗枝大叶和官僚主义在作崇。我们领导方面是应该深刻自我检讨并加以改正的。
