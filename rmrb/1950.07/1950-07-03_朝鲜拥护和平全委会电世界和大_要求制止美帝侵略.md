　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd. The National Committee for the Defense of World Peace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on June 30, sent a cable to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, requesting a discussion on the issue of American imperialism directing Syngman Rhee to launch a civil war and carrying out armed intervention and aggression; and to take appropriate measures to stop American imperialist aggression and support the Korean people's struggle for the unification, freedom, and independence of their motherland. The cable pointed out that American imperialism not only instigated the Syngman Rhee clique to launch a civil war, but has also directly waged war against the Korean people, attempting to invade the entire territory of our country.

　　The cable continued: American aircraft are carrying out bestial attacks on Korean cities and villages, and are also bombing trains carrying peaceful people. At the same time, they bombed the cities of Kaesong, Uijongbu, and Chuncheon, which were liberated by the heroic People's Army, and brutally massacred peaceful residents, men, women, old and young. On June 29, American imperialist aircraft bombed areas north of the 38th parallel, including Pyongyang, causing the deaths of many peaceful residents. The aggressive actions of American imperialism barbarously violate international law and the United Nations Charter. The hatred and anger of the Korean people towards American imperialism have reached their peak. No bestial military action by American imperialism can stop our people's patriotic struggle. All the people of our country, at any cost, must completely eliminate the Syngman Rhee clique in a short period of time and quickly end the civil war created and intervened in by American imperialism, and rescue our motherland from the clutches of American imperialists.

　　The cable concluded: The Korean National Committee for the Defense of World Peace believes that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress will definitely support the Korean people's struggle for the unification, freedom, and independence of their motherland, and believes that the voices against and protesting the war-mongers' aggression against Korea will resound throughout the world.

　　朝鲜拥护和平全委会电世界和大
    要求制止美帝侵略
    【新华社平壤二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国拥护世界和平全国委员会，于六月三十日致电世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，要求就美帝国主义指挥李承晚发动内战，进行武装干涉与侵略的问题加以讨论；并采取适当措施制止美帝国主义的侵略，支持为祖国的统一、自由、独立而斗争的朝鲜人民。电文指出：美帝国主义不但指使李承晚匪帮发动内战，而且已直接对朝鲜人民进行战争，妄图侵占我国的全部领土。
    电文继称：美国飞机对朝鲜的城市和乡村进行野兽般的袭击，对和平人民所乘坐的列车也加以轰炸。同时，并轰炸了被英勇的人民军解放的开城、议政府、春川等城市，残酷地屠杀了男女老幼和平居民。六月二十九日，美帝国主义飞机轰炸了以平壤为首的三八线以北地区，致使众多的和平居民死亡。美帝国主义的侵略行为，野蛮地违反了国际法与联合国宪章。朝鲜人民对美帝国主义的憎恨与愤怒，已达顶点。美帝国主义任何野兽般的军事行动，都不能阻挡我们人民的爱国斗争，我国全体人民不惜任何牺牲，一定要在短期内完全消灭李承晚匪帮，迅速结束美帝国主义所制造并加以干涉的内战。从美帝国主义者魔掌中挽救我们的祖国。
    电文结语称：朝鲜拥护世界和平全国委员会相信，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会一定会支持为自己祖国的统一、自由、独立而斗争的朝鲜人民。并相信反对与抗议战争贩子侵略朝鲜的呼声将响遍全世界。
