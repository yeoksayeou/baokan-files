　　Cangxian Special District Universally Establishes Radio Network
    The Entire District Now Has More Than 130 Radios
    Radio Operators in Various Agencies Record Important News On Time
    [Our Dispatch] Various agencies and the nine counties and two towns under the jurisdiction of Cangxian Special District, Hebei Province, have universally installed radios and equipped them with radio operators (Jiaohe County and Bo and Cang towns have not set up radio operators). According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 132 radios in the entire district (including 58 private radios). Agencies equipped with radio operators generally listen to broadcasts on time and make records, which has played a positive guiding role in the central work of various periods. For example, after Hejian, Xianxian, and Suning counties recorded reports on the three-level popular elections, spring planting, cotton planting, and pest control, they immediately printed and distributed them to various districts, enabling leaders at all levels to be prepared ideologically in advance and strive for initiative in their work. Listening to lectures on social sciences has helped cadres participating in first-class studies solve many difficult problems.
    However, many leading cadres do not have enough understanding of using radio to guide work and educate the masses, and they rarely conduct responsible research on recorded radio documents. The Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee lacks in-depth inspection of radio work. At the general county and town committee propaganda department meetings, radio work is rarely studied. The work of mobilizing and organizing the masses to listen is also done very little, so there are not many listeners. Because the leadership does not pay much attention to radio work, some radio operators also despise their work, so their enthusiasm for radio work is not high, which reduces the due role of the radio network. In order to strengthen radio work and give full play to the role of the radio network, the Propaganda Department of the Cangxian District Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward specific opinions on improving radio work in the area.

　　沧县专区普建收音网
    全区现已有收音机一百三十多架
    各机关收音员按时收录重要新闻
    【本报讯】河北沧县专区各机关及所属九县两镇，已普遍装置收音机并配备了收音员（交河县及泊、沧两镇未设收音员）。据不完全统计，全区共有收音机一百三十二架（内包括私人收音机五十八架）。配有收音员的机关，一般均能按时收听广播并作记录，对各个时期的中心工作均起了积极的指导作用。如河间、献县、肃宁等县，在收记了三级民选、春播、种棉、防除虫害等报道后，立即印发到各区，使各级领导方面早有思想准备，争取了工作上的主动。社会科学讲座的收听，帮助了参加甲级学习的干部解决不少疑难问题。
    但有不少领导干部对利用广播指导工作、教育群众的认识不够，对收音记录的文件，很少作负责的研究。地委宣传部对收音工作缺乏深入的检查。在一般县镇委宣传部部务会议上，极少研究收音工作。发动与组织群众收听的工作亦做得很少，因而听众不多。由于领导上对收音工作不大注意，致使部分收音员也轻视自己的工作，以至对收音工作情绪不高，这就减低了收音网应有的作用。为了加强收音工作，充分发挥收音网的作用，中共沧县地委宣传部已提出了改进该区收音工作的具体意见。
