Comrade Yang Zhihua's Letter

To the Editor:

　　I think Comrade Zang Kejia's opinion is very correct. The situation at that time was like this: Chiang Kai-shek and the spineless traitors he bought, in order to oppose the Communist Party, slandered Comrade Qu Qiubai. For example, "Superfluous Words" written by Qiubai in prison, etc., were snatched back from the hands of news reporters by Chiang's henchmen, who said that things that had not been reviewed were not allowed to be taken out. The so-called "review" was to prevent the exposure of the real facts, and to modify Qiubai's works in prison in order to insult the unyielding integrity of the Communists. But the facts cannot be erased after all. I recently heard Mr. Zhou Ruohua say that after Qiubai was arrested, he was tortured to extract a confession, but Qiubai did not yield. At the same time, the two factions of Chiang's secret agents were vying for credit, so they telegraphed Chiang for instructions. Later, Chiang replied that if persuasion to surrender failed, he should be executed on the spot. As a result, Qiubai was shot. Precisely because Qiubai refused the divisive persuasion to surrender, according to the person who carried out Chiang's order, Qiubai's answer at the time was very firm: "A person loves his own history more than a bird loves its wings, please don't tear up my history." Therefore, even the person who persuaded him to surrender admired Qiubai's integrity. It was precisely because the enemy did not achieve its goal that it had to revise Qiubai's works in prison and publish them in reactionary newspapers. However, the published texts are different from each other, which can also prove the enemy's conspiracy. Now some friends who cherish him are still continuing to publish the revised works, which is exactly what the enemy wants.

　　杨之华同志来信编辑同志：
    臧克家同志所提的意见，我认为很对。当时的情况是这样的：蒋介石和被他所收买的无骨气的叛徒，为了要反对共产党，所以来污蔑瞿秋白同志。例如：秋白在狱中写的《多余的话》等等，蒋匪的爪牙从新闻记者的手中抢回去，说是未经审阅的东西不准拿出去。所谓“审阅”，就是不准暴露真实的事实，为要侮辱共产党人不屈的气节而修改秋白在狱中的作品。但是事实始终不能抹杀。我最近听周若华先生说：当秋白被捕后，曾被用酷刑迫取口供，但秋白不屈，同时蒋匪的两派特务又互相争功，乃电蒋匪请示。后蒋匪复电如劝降不成，就地枪决。结果秋白被枪毙了。就因为秋白拒绝了挑拨离间的劝降手段，据执行蒋匪命令的人说：当时秋白的回答很坚决：“一个人爱自己的历史，比鸟爱翅膀更厉害，请你不要撕破我的历史。”因此，连这个劝降的人也很佩服秋白的气节。正因为敌人没有达到目的，只好修改了秋白在狱中的作品，并发表在反动报纸上。可是发表的文字各有不同，这也可以证明敌人的阴谋。现在有些爱护他的朋友还在继续发表被修改过的作品，正是上了敌人的大当。
