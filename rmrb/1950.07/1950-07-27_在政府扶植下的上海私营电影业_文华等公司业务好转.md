　　Under Government Support, Shanghai's Private Film Industry
    Wenhua and Other Companies See Improved Business
    [Shanghai News] "Liberation Daily" reports: Shanghai's four private film companies, Wenhua, Kunlun, Guotai, and Datong, are gradually overcoming difficulties and restoring and maintaining production under the leadership and support of the People's Government. Since October of last year, Kunlun, Guotai, and Datong film companies in Shanghai had temporarily halted production due to difficulties in capital turnover. The Film Office of the Literary and Art Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Film Management Office of the Cultural Bureau actively supported and encouraged their operation and production of progressive films by providing loans, lending some raw materials, and assisting in export and distribution. Since October of last year, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China has successively provided the four companies, including Kunlun, with distribution loans totaling 2.009 billion yuan; in November, it provided Guotai, Datong, and Kunlun with production loans of 220,000 "discount units." From December of last year to February of this year, a consortium of thirteen joint public-private and private banks, including Xinhua Bank, provided the aforementioned four companies with production loans totaling 2.0059 billion yuan. At the same time, the Central Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government supplied companies such as Kunlun and Wenhua with 80,000 feet of "duplicate film" (raw material used for making printing copies), and provided 200,000 Hong Kong dollars in usance, and helped with distribution to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and other places, enabling private film companies to overcome nine months of difficulties. Among them, Wenhua Company has achieved considerable development in its business under the support of the government because of the unity of its employees, the establishment of a democratic management system, and the tightening of its budget; at the same time, the company has adopted a more serious attitude in its production work and paid attention to nationwide distribution. This year, the company has completed the production of three films, including "The Story of My Life," and another film, "Ideological Problems," is about to be completed. In addition, it is preparing to produce films such as "Corruption," and this year will exceed the planned completion of four films. However, some private film companies still have a dependence mentality and have not well reformed their own unsound systems, improved business management, adjusted payment budgets and labor-management relations, etc., and are therefore in a difficult situation, and have not repaid some public and private loans by the end of June.

　　在政府扶植下的上海私营电影业
    文华等公司业务好转
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：上海市文华、昆仑、国泰、大同等四家私营影片公司，在人民政府的领导与扶助下，逐渐克服困难，恢复和维持了生产。去年十月以来，上海昆仑、国泰、大同等影片公司，曾因资金周转困难，生产一度停顿。上海市军管会文艺处电影室和文化局电影事业管理处，曾先后予以贷款、借给部分原料、协助办理出口、发行等方式，积极扶植与鼓励其经营、摄制进步影片。去年十月起，人民银行上海分行曾先后贷与昆仑等四公司发行贷款二十亿零九千万元；十一月，又贷给国泰、大同、昆仑三公司生产贷款二十二万个折实单位。去年十二月至今年二月，又由新华银行等十三家公私合营和私营银行联合贷给上述四公司生产贷款共二十亿零五千九百万元。同时，中央人民政府文化部中央电影局对昆仑、文华等公司，曾供给副片（印考贝用的原料）八万英尺；代做押汇二十万元港币，并代为发行至香港、南洋等地，使私营影片公司度过了九个月的困难。其中文华公司因职工团结，建立了民主管理制度，紧缩了预算；同时该公司在摄制工作中也采取了比较认真的态度，并注意了全国性的发行工作，在政府的扶助下，该公司的业务已有相当发展。今年度该公司已摄制完成了“我这一辈子”等三部影片，另有“思想问题”一片即将完成，此外还预备摄制“腐蚀”等片，本年将超过预定完成四部影片的计划。但有若干私营影片公司，还存在着依赖性，没有很好地改革本身不健全的制度、改善经营管理、调整支付预算和劳资关系等，因此陷于困难境地，对部分公、私贷款到六月底尚未清偿。
