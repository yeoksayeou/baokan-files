The just war waged by the Korean people to eliminate the invading Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) puppet army and the American aggressors has lasted for twenty-five days. The courageous People's Army, with the support of the broad masses of the people and the coordination of the people's guerrillas in the south, has successively won brilliant victories, annihilating the so-called "elite" of the Li Chengwan puppet army – the Capital Division, the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Divisions, and the main forces of the First and Fifth Divisions. The United States announced on June 27 that it would support the Li Chengwan bandit army with naval and air forces, and then participated in armed intervention with the army, and was forced to gradually increase its troops in an attempt to reverse the defeat. However, the heroic People's Army is forcing the U.S. military to retreat again and again, causing it to suffer heavy losses. As of the 17th, the People's Army has liberated approximately two-fifths of the land in southern Korea, including the completely liberated Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon Province, most of North Chungcheong Province and South Chungcheong Province, the three provincial capitals of Seoul, Chuncheon, and Cheongju, and the industrial areas of Korea, including Yeongdeungpo, Bupyeong, Incheon, and more than 50 county towns such as Gaeseong, Suwon, Pyeongtaek, Cheonan, Wonju, Chungju, Buyeo, and Nonsan. Now, the People's Army is pursuing the remnants of the enemy from all fronts, breaking through the barbaric bombing of the U.S. Air Force, and continuing to advance victoriously.

	The People's Army Advances on Three Routes
	The Li Chengwan puppet army invaded the area north of the 38th parallel on the morning of June 25, and was immediately hit hard by the North Korean security forces; after the People's Army was ordered to quickly defeat the enemy's invasion, it immediately switched to a counter-offensive, pushing the liberation war into the area south of the 38th parallel. The powerful People's Army advanced south from the Hwanghae Province and Gyeonggi Province area, successively capturing Yeon'an, Baegcheon, Cheongdan, Yeonbaek, Ongjin Peninsula, Gaeseong, Jangan, Dongducheon, and Uijeongbu, and then victoriously liberated the capital Seoul on the morning of the 28th. Another route advanced south from the Gangwon Province area, liberating Chuncheon, Hongcheon, and many county towns in southeastern Gyeonggi Province, and then advanced into North Chungcheong Province, liberating Jecheon, Chungju, Danyang, crossing the northern part of North Gyeongsang Province, liberating Junryeong, Mungyeong, and continuing south. Another route of the People's Army rapidly advanced south along the east coast corridor, joining forces with the people's guerrillas in Gangneung, Samcheok, Uljin, and other places, and the People's Army troops that landed on the east coast, liberating Uljin, Yeongwol, Gyeongju, and other places, and continuing to advance forward.
	The direct and frantic interference of the United States in the Korean civil war cannot stop the advance of the People's Army, nor can it absolutely save the defeat of the Li Chengwan bandit army. The People's Army, which liberated Seoul, continued to advance courageously, eliminating the U.S.-Li bandit army that attempted to resist stubbornly between Seoul and Suwon, and liberated Suwon on July 4. The U.S. invading army suffered a defeat in its first battle with the People's Army!
	In the battles before the liberation of Suwon, the main force of the Li Chengwan puppet army had been almost completely annihilated. The People's Army annihilated the Second and Seventh Divisions of the puppet army in the Uijeongbu battle, the Capital Division of the puppet army in the Seoul battle, the Sixth and Eighth Divisions of the puppet army on the east coast, annihilated more than 3,000 enemies in the battle to liberate the Ongjin Peninsula, and annihilated the main force of the First and Fifth Divisions of the puppet army, more than 12,000 people, in the battle on the right bank of the lower reaches of the Han River north of Incheon, annihilated a division of the enemy in the battle between Seoul and Suwon, and annihilated more than 8,000 enemies when liberating Incheon. The puppet army also revolted and surrendered to the people. Now, there are very few remnants of Li Chengwan's puppet army.

	Striking Hard at the American Aggressors
	After the Suwon battle, the U.S. invading army replaced the defeated Li Chengwan puppet army and assumed the main combat tasks. In the encounter battle between the Korean People's Army and the U.S. military south of Suwon, more than 200 enemy soldiers were killed or captured. On July 6, another 300 U.S. soldiers were annihilated in the battle to liberate Pyeongtaek. The People's Army encircled and annihilated an American battalion in the area south of Cheonan. On the 11th, the People's Army annihilated almost all of the U.S. military, which used a large number of tank units for the first time, in the area south of Jochiwon and north of Daejeon, annihilating and capturing more than 1,200 U.S. soldiers. In the encirclement and annihilation battle in Daepyeong-ri, northwest of Daejeon, the People's Army annihilated more than 2,500 U.S. soldiers and captured more than 100 U.S. soldiers. In this way, the losses of the U.S. Army alone have been one regiment, one battalion, and another 4,700 people killed or captured.
	The People's Army Air Force and Navy fought bravely and continuously inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Although the United States, with its superior air and naval forces, plus the accomplices of Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, etc., cannot stop the victorious advance of the People's Army. The young People's Air Force defeated the enemy's combat system and bravely attacked the air force fleets of the American armed invaders. In fierce air battles, the People's Air Force shot down dozens of bombers and fighters led by the U.S.'s highly touted "Super Fortress" B-29, repeatedly repelled the U.S. Air Force's barbaric bombing of peaceful residents, and effectively guaranteed the advance of the People's Army's ground forces. The People's Navy, with fewer forces than the enemy, constantly fought against the U.S. and British navies invading the territorial waters on the east and west coasts, bravely attacking the powerful enemy and sinking many enemy warships of various sizes, including U.S. cruisers.
	Under the offensive of the powerful People's Army, the American aggressors were repeatedly defeated and panicked. This series of facts shows that the American aggressors have no justification for their actions, have no morale, and are a paper tiger that looks strong on the outside but is weak on the inside. The Korean People's Army, standing on the side of truth and justice, is able to grasp the initiative on all fronts. Reports from the front lines in Korea by American journalists have had to admit that the U.S. military is finding it difficult to cope with the Korean People's Army's "probing," "infiltration," and "encirclement" tactics.
	After repeated defeats, the U.S. military attempted to use the Geum River, a "natural barrier to defend against tanks," north of Daejeon as a line of "no retreat," hoping to gain a respite by using the "natural barrier" of the Geum River. However, the victorious People's Army advanced directly to the Geum River from the middle, left, and right routes, liberating Jochiwon and crossing the Geum River in the middle route; liberating Cheongju on the 13th in the left route and continuing to advance to force the Geum River; and crossing the Geum River near Gongju on the 14th in the right route, liberating Gongju and Hongseong County on the 15th, and liberating Buyeo and Nonsan, southwest of Daejeon, on the 17th. The "natural barrier" that the U.S. military had been using to comfort itself for several days has been shattered. The remnants of Li Chengwan and the U.S. military staff, who had just fled to Daejeon in a state of panic, immediately fled from Daejeon again. The People's Army is encircling Daejeon. The fact that the People's Army quickly crossed the Geum River shows that neither the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Army, or even tank units, Dean, Walker (both commanders of the U.S. military in Korea), nor the Han River or the Geum River can stop the victorious advance of the Korean People's Army. The American aggressors are trying to win the war with tons of bombs and munitions, but they have forgotten that "the most important factor in determining the war is the people." The Korean People's Army has been able to defeat the enemy because it has received the full support of the Korean people and the sympathy and assistance of the world's peace and democracy camp.

	People's Guerrillas Actively Conduct Activities
	The people's guerrillas in various parts of southern Korea have widely launched active activities after the Li Chengwan bandit gang launched the civil war. They harassed the enemy's rear, attacked the enemy's army from the flanks, cut off the enemy's transportation lines, intercepted the defeated enemy, and organized the people to carry out propaganda and mobilization work, expand the liberated areas, and cooperate with the People's Army in combat.
	The people's guerrillas active in southern Gangwon Province, with the support of the broad masses of the people, liberated Uljin on June 26, and joined forces with the insurgent miners of Yeongwol to liberate Yeongwol County. The people's guerrillas in the Taebaek Mountains joined forces with the People's Army troops that landed on the east coast on June 28, and attacked the enemy's army everywhere. The people's guerrillas in South Gyeongsang Province destroyed important railways and bridges near Busan, hindering the U.S. military's deployment and transportation, and carried out propaganda and mobilization while eliminating the puppet police and evil local tyrants and secret agents in the Cheongdo and Miryang areas. The people's guerrillas in the Jirisan and Honam areas carried out fierce activities in areas such as Sancheong, Hamyang, Hadong, and Geochang, constantly attacking the puppet police stations in Gwangju, Hwasun, Suncheon, and other transportation hubs, paralyzing the enemy's rear political institutions.
	The people's guerrillas in southern Korea ignited the flames of resistance in various places, adding countless difficulties to the American aggressors, making them feel that they "cannot stand" because "there are snipers everywhere." Continuing this criminal activity of aggression against the Korean people will only lead to death.

	Another armed force of the Korean people is the uprising troops of the Li Chengwan puppet army. The forces of Pyo Mu-won and Kang Tae-moo, who revolted last year, have moved to the front line, and Song Ho-sung, the former commander-in-chief of the South Korean puppet "National Defense Army," has also revolted. In the newly liberated areas such as Seoul and Gaeseong, people's volunteer armies have been organized to assist the People's Army in combat. Many captured puppet soldiers have requested to join the People's Army and fight to eliminate the American aggressors.

	The Korean People's Great Patriotic Upsurge
	In the People's Liberation War, the Korean people actively took action to support the advance of the People's Army. Under the call of General Kim Il-sung, 740,000 young people in the north have written applications requesting to join the army and go to the front line, and more than 100,000 young people in Seoul and other newly liberated areas have joined the self-defense army in order to completely eliminate the Li Chengwan traitorous group and the American aggressors. Land reform will be implemented in the newly liberated areas, the people's government will be restored, and elections for county, district, and township people's committees will be held to consolidate the victory and ensure the completion of the People's Liberation War. The people in the north of the Republic and the people who have been liberated in the south are rushing to repair the cities and villages that have been ravaged by American aircraft. Workers and staff in factories throughout the north guarantee to complete two months of production tasks in one month, and many women automatically participate in factory work to replace the men who have gone to war. Patriotic national capitalists, merchants, and citizens have donated money and contributed tanks and aircraft. With the strong support of the world's peace and democracy camp, the entire Korean people are closely united around General Kim Il-sung, and under the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, they are victoriously carrying out the just war to completely eliminate the Li Chengwan remnants and drive out the American aggressors, liberating the southern territory. The final victory will undoubtedly belong to the Korean people, not to the American imperialists who are carrying out aggression under the banner of the United Nations. (July 19)

　　朝鲜人民解放战争的现势
    金圣容
    朝鲜人民为消灭进犯的李承晚伪军和美国侵略者而进行的正义战争，已有二十五天。奋勇前进的人民军，在广大人民的支援和南部人民游击队的配合下，连续获得辉煌的胜利，先后歼灭了李承晚伪军的所谓“精锐”——首都、第二、第六、第七、第八五个师团和第一、第五两个师团的主力。美国于六月二十七日宣布以海空军支援李承晚匪军作战，继之又以陆军参加武装干涉，并且被迫逐次增兵，企图挽回败局，然而英勇的人民军正迫使美军一退再退，并使其遭受惨重的损失。截至十七日止，人民军已解放了南部朝鲜大约五分之二的土地，包括完全解放的京畿道江原道两个省、忠清南道忠清北道两个省的大部，汉城、春川、清州三个省会，和朝鲜的工业地带永登浦、富平、仁川等城市及开城、水原、平泽、天安、原州、忠州、扶余、论山等五十余座县城。现在，人民军正自各战线追击残敌，突破美空军部队的野蛮轰炸，继续胜利推进中。
            人民军三路前进
    李承晚伪军于六月二十五日晨向三八线以北地区进犯，当即遭到北朝鲜警备队的痛击；人民军奉令迅速地击溃了敌人的进犯后，随即转入反攻，将解放战争推向三八线以南地区。强大的人民军，一路自黄海道、京畿道地区向南挺进，连克延安、白川、青丹、延白、瓮津半岛、开城、长湍、东豆川和议政府后，于二十八日晨胜利解放首都汉城。一路自江原道地区南下，解放了春川、洪川及京畿道东南部许多县城后，挺进忠清北道境内，解放了提川、忠州、丹阳、越过庆尚北道北部解放峻岭、闻庆，继续南进。另路人民军则沿东海岸走廊地带急速南下，与江陵、三陟、蔚珍等地的人民游击队和在东海岸登陆的人民军部队会师，解放了蔚珍、宁越、庆州等地，继续向前进击。
    美国对朝鲜内战直接的疯狂干涉，并不能阻挡人民军的前进，也绝对挽救不了李承晚匪军的溃败。解放汉城的人民军继续奋勇前进，消灭了汉城水原间企图顽抗的美李匪军，于七月四日解放了水原市。侵略朝鲜的美军在初次与人民军的战斗中即吃了败仗！
    在解放水原以前的各次战役中，李承晚伪军的主力已被歼殆尽。人民军在议政府战役中歼伪军第二第七两个师团，汉城战役中歼伪军首都师团，在东海岸击溃伪军第六、第八两个师团，解放瓮津半岛战事中歼敌三千余人，仁川以北汉江下游右岸的战役中歼伪军第一、第五两个师团主力一万二千余人，汉城水原间战役歼敌一个师团，解放仁川时歼敌八千余人。伪军并纷纷起义，投向人民。现在，李承晚的伪军已经残余无几。
            痛击美国侵略者
    水原战役之后，美国侵略军代替了溃不成军的李承晚伪军，担任主要战斗任务。水原以南，朝鲜人民军与美军的遭遇战，毙俘其二百余名。七月六日，在解放平泽战役中再歼美军三百余名。天安以南地区人民军围歼了美国一个营。十一日，人民军在鸟致院以南大田以北地区，将第一次使用大量坦克部队的美军歼灭殆尽，歼俘美军一千二百余名。大田西北大平里的包围歼灭战中，人民军歼灭美军二千五百余名，俘美军一百余名。这样仅美国陆军的损失，已有一个团，一个营，另被毙或被俘者四千七百余人。
    人民军的空军和海军，勇敢作战，连续重创敌人。虽然，美国挟其优势空海兵力，还要加上英、澳、纽等国的帮凶力量，然而，它们阻止不了人民军的胜利前进。年青的人民空军部队击溃了敌军的战斗体系，勇敢地攻击了美国武装侵犯者的空军机群。人民空军在激烈的空战中，击落了美国极力吹嘘的“超级空中堡垒”Ｂ—二十九式为首的轰炸机与战斗机数十架，屡次击退美国空军机群对和平居民的野蛮轰炸，并有效的保障了人民军地面部队的前进。人民海军以少胜众，在东海岸与西海岸，不断与侵犯领海的美英海军作战，勇敢地打击强敌，击沉美国巡洋舰等大小许多敌军舰只。
    在强大的人民军攻势下，美国侵略者连战连败，惊惶失措。这一系列的事实说明美国侵略者师出无名、士气毫无，是一个外强中干的纸老虎。而站在真理与正义一方面的朝鲜人民军，能够在全部战线上掌握主动。美国记者们自朝鲜前线发出的报道，不得不承认对于朝鲜人民军的“试探”“渗透”和“包围”的“六韬三略”，美军已经难于应付。
    美军在节节败退之后，妄图在大田以北的“防御坦克的天然障碍”的锦江作为“决不后退”的防线，希望能借锦江“天险”获得喘息机会。但是胜利挺进的人民军，分自中左右三路直薄锦江，中路解放鸟致院并渡过锦江；左路于十三日解放清州市，并继续前进逼迫锦江；右路于十四日在公州附近地区渡过锦江，于十五日解放公州和洪城县，十七日解放了大田西南的扶余和论山。数日来美军借以自慰的“天然障碍”已被冲得七零八落。刚刚逃到大田惊魂甫定的李承晚残匪和美军参谋部，又立即从大田逃窜。人民军正向大田进行合围中。人民军迅速渡过锦江，这一事实说明无论美国空军、海军、陆军，甚至坦克部队，迪安、瓦克（两人均为美军在朝鲜的指挥官），或是汉江、锦江，都不能阻止朝鲜人民军的胜利前进。美国侵略者妄图以吨计的炸弹与军火取得战争的胜利，但它忘记了“决定战争的最重要的因素是人民”，朝鲜人民军能够击溃了敌人，就是得了朝鲜人民的全力的支援与全世界和平民主阵营的同情援助。
            人民游击队积极活动
    朝鲜南部各地的人民游击队，在李承晚匪帮发动内战后，已广泛展开积极的活动。他们扰乱敌后，侧击敌军，切断敌交通线，截击溃敌，并组织人民，进行宣传鼓动工作，扩大解放区，配合人民军作战。
    活跃在江原道南部的人民游击队，在广大人民支持下，于六月二十六日解放蔚珍，并与宁越起义矿工会合，解放宁越县城。太白山区的人民游击队六月二十八日先后与在东海岸登陆的人民军部队会师，到处袭击敌军。庆尚南道的人民游击队破坏了釜山附近重要铁路、桥梁，阻挠美军调动和运输，并在清道、密阳地区一面进行宣传动员，一面肃清伪警和恶霸特务。智异山区和湖南区的人民游击队在山清、咸阳、河东、居昌等地区猛烈的活动，不断袭击交通中枢的光州、和顺、顺天等地的伪警察支署，使敌人的后方政权机构陷于瘫痪。
    朝鲜南部人民游击队在各地燃起反抗的烈火，给美国侵略者增加无数的困难，使他们已感到“到处都是狙击手”而不能立足，继续这一侵略朝鲜人民的罪恶活动，只有死路一条。
    朝鲜人民的另一支武装力量，是李承晚伪军的起义部队。去年起义的表武元、姜?武两部队等已向前线出动，前南朝鲜伪“护国军”总司令宋虎声也起义。在汉城、开城等新解放区，人民义勇军已经组织起来，协助人民军作战。许多被俘伪军，纷纷要求参加人民军，为消灭美国侵略者而战斗。
            朝鲜人民巨大的爱国热潮
    在人民解放战争中，朝鲜人民积极行动支援人民军的前进。在金日成将军号召下，北部已有七十四万青年写了申请书，要求参军上前线，汉城和其他新解放地区的青年有十万以上，为了彻底消灭李承晚卖国集团和美国侵略者，参加了自卫军。在新解放区准备实施土地改革，恢复人民政权，将实行县、区、乡人民委员会的选举，巩固胜利，并保障完成人民解放战争。共和国北部人民和南部已获得解放的人民，正在抢修遭受美国飞机乱肆轰炸破坏的城市和乡村。北部各地工厂职工保证一个月完成两个月的生产任务，许多妇女自动参加工厂工作代替出征的男子。爱国的民族资本家和商人、市民们，纷纷捐款，献纳坦克与飞机。有世界和平民主阵营强力支持的全朝鲜人民，正紧密地团结在金日成将军的周围，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国旗帜下，胜利地进行着完全消灭李承晚残匪和驱逐美国侵略者，解放南部国土的正义战争。最后的胜利，决不属于假借联合国旗帜进行侵略的美国帝国主义者，而是毫无疑义的属于朝鲜人民。（七月十九日）
