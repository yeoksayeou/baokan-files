　　Qingdao and Qishuyan Power Plants' Friendship Competition
　　Qingdao Wins Coal Saving Competition
　　[Our Qingdao Dispatch] The Qingdao Power Plant and the Qishuyan Power Plant in East China launched a seven-month coal and electricity saving competition on June 1st. The results of the first phase of the competition, which ended at the end of June, show that the Qingdao Power Plant was victorious.

　　Before the competition, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, based on the equipment of the two plants, stipulated different competition quota conditions. As a result, the coal consumption of the Qingdao Power Plant was 9.149% lower than the Ministry's standard, the actual coal consumption was reduced by 9.93%, and the plant's power consumption was reduced by 10.282%, all of which were lower than that of the Qishuyan Power Plant.

　　At the beginning of the competition, the Qingdao Power Plant's trade union and administration signed a collective contract to ensure victory. The administration and various units, after full research, formulated production plans to give employees clear goals to strive for. Employees' safety inspections of machines have also taken a step forward. In order to ensure the effective implementation of the collective contract, various departments also signed mutual contact contracts. On the basis of the collective contract, the Party, government, and labor union united as one, and all employees used both their hands and brains to improve work efficiency by improving machine parts and work procedures. In terms of saving electricity, the plant's technicians calculated in detail the output of each auxiliary machine in the plant and proposed that one 175-horsepower seawater pump could be saved from the four seawater pumps, saving 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. In terms of coal consumption, at the beginning of the competition, workers' suggestions were adopted to modify the filter grid, reducing the gap from 1 and 1/8 inches to 7/8 inches, so that lump coal was completely isolated and burned thoroughly. At the same time, the water addition time of coal was accurately controlled, keeping the moisture content between 9% and 10%. The plant's technicians also formulated a load distribution ratio based on the different performance of the machines, so that the power load could be distributed more rationally. These efforts by the employees of the Qingdao Power Plant ensured the victory of the competition.

　　The main reason why the Qishuyan Power Plant's performance in the first phase of the competition was worse than that of the Qingdao Power Plant was insufficient attention to safe power generation. The plant's second power plant had a total of five accidents in June, losing 35,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.

　　Currently, the production enthusiasm of the employees of both plants is still very high. The Qingdao Power Plant has put forward "Oppose Complacency" to encourage employees to make persistent efforts. The employees of the Qishuyan Power Plant are rushing to install the No. 3 unit, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit aircraft, to replace the old No. 1 unit; and are preparing to sign a collective contract with the administration in order to win the second phase of the competition.

　　青岛、戚墅堰两电厂友谊竞赛
    省煤竞赛青岛获胜
    【本报青岛讯】华东区青岛电厂与戚墅堰电厂自六月一日展开为时七个月的省煤省电竞赛。到六月底止第一期竞赛结果，青岛电厂获得胜利。
    竞赛前，中央燃料工业部根据两厂的设备，规定了不同的竞赛定额条件。结果青岛电厂煤耗较部定标准降低百分之九点一四九，实发煤耗减少百分之九点九三，厂用电减少百分之十点二八二，各项均比戚墅堰电厂为低。
    青岛电厂在开始竞赛时，为保证胜利，工会与行政即签订了集体合同。行政和各单位经过充分研究均制订了生产计划，使职工有了明确的奋斗目标。职工对机器的安全检查也较前进了一步。各部门之间，为保证集体合同切实实现，也相互订立了联系合同。在集体合同的基础上，党、政、工团结一致，全体职工手脑并用，从改进机件和工作操作法上来提高工作效率。在节省电方面，该厂技术员详细的计算了厂内每一个附属机器的出力，提出了四个海水车中可省用一个一百七十五匹马力的海水车，每天可省电三万度。在煤耗方面，竞赛初期即采纳工人建议，将滤栅改装，空隙由一英寸一分缩小至七分，使块煤完全隔离，并且燃烧彻底，同时准确地掌握了煤的加水时间，保持水分在百分之九至十之间，该厂技术员又根据机器的不同性能，制定了负荷分配的比例，使电力负荷得以更合理的分配。青岛电厂职工们的这些努力，保证了竞赛的胜利。
    戚墅堰电厂第一期竞赛中成绩较青岛厂为差的主要原因是对安全发电注意不够。该厂第二发电所六月份共发生五次事故，损失电三万五千度。
    现两厂职工生产情绪仍极高涨。青岛电厂提出“反对自满”，鼓励职工再接再厉。戚墅堰电厂职工正在赶装被国民党匪机炸毁的三号机，以代替陈旧的一号机；并准备和行政上订立集体合同，以争取第二期竞赛的胜利。
