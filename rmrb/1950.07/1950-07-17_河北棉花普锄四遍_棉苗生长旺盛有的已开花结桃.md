　　Hebei Cotton Fields Universally Hoed Four Times
    Cotton Seedlings Grow Vigorously, Some Already Flowering and Bearing Cotton Bolls
    [Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive report from correspondents: In Hebei province, 14 million mu of cotton fields have been universally hoed three to four times under the slogan of "early hoeing, more hoeing, resisting drought, and ensuring harvest," and a small number of areas have hoed five to six times. Since the beginning of spring in the province, most areas have had sufficient rainfall, timely hoeing, and attention has been paid to pest control. Cotton seedlings are growing very fast, generally reaching a height of one foot to one and a half feet, and some have already flowered and borne cotton bolls. The farmers are overjoyed and are stepping up the work of hoeing seedlings, striving to hoe seven to eight times.
    In conjunction with the work of hoeing seedlings, various localities have also launched the work of side-shoot removal and pruning. For example, cotton farmers in Dongbeihe, Second District, Cheng'an County, because they harvested more cotton last year due to side-shoot removal, are paying special attention to side-shoot removal and pruning techniques this year. Farmers in Ge Village, Eighth District, Wu'an County, who did not have the habit of side-shoot removal, also actively carried out side-shoot removal work after the cadres took the lead in trying it out. In order to mobilize the masses to remove side-shoots and prune, and improve cotton planting techniques, many areas have also held agricultural technology research conferences and symposiums with model laborers and cotton planting experts. For example, the agricultural technology research conference in Dongfoluo Village, Anguo County, and the symposium with model laborers and cotton planting experts in Beisong Village, Ren County, after discussion, believed that flower legs (i.e., side-shoots) should be removed below the cotton branches bearing cotton bolls. They studied examples of increased flower harvest due to cotton side-shoot removal, and further recognized the importance of trimming cotton branches. Li Mingqi, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch in Beisong Village, Ren County, and others, after the meeting, taught 89 women to master side-shoot removal techniques, and extracted male laborers to hoe 210 mu of cotton five times and irrigate 456 mu of cotton fields for the second time. In some areas, after side-shoot removal, topdressing fertilizer was applied to the cotton fields. In order to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for cotton farmers, the Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Zone, the Tangshan Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Tianjin Prefecture Branch of the People's Bank of China have provided a large amount of fertilizer.

　　河北棉花普锄四遍
    棉苗生长旺盛有的已开花结桃
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报道：河北省一千四百万亩棉田，在“早锄、多锄、抗旱、保收”的口号下，已普遍锄过三遍至四遍，少数地区锄到五至六遍。该省入春以来，大部地区雨量充足，锄耪及时，并注意了防治虫害，棉苗成长甚快，一般已长到一尺至一尺半高，有的已开花结桃，农民喜形于色，现正加紧进行锄苗工作，争取锄到七至八遍。
    结合锄苗工作，各地并展开了打杈、整枝工作。如成安县二区东北河棉农，因去年打杈多收了棉花，今年对打枝、整枝技术特别重视。没有打杈习惯的武安县八区葛村农民，在干部带头试行棉花打杈后，也积极进行打杈工作。为了发动群众打杈、整枝，提高种棉技术，不少地区还召开了农业技术研究会与劳动模范、种棉能手座谈会。如安国县东佛落村农业技术研究会、任县北宋村劳动模范和种棉能手座谈会，经讨论后，认为捋花腿（即打杈）应捋到结桃的棉枝下边。研究了棉花打杈多收花的实例，进一步认识了修整棉枝的重要性。任县北宋村中共支部书记李明岐等，会后并教会了八十九个妇女掌握打杈技术，抽出男劳动力把二百一十亩棉花锄了五遍，四百五十六亩棉田浇了第二次水。有些地区在打完杈后，棉田都上了追肥。为解决棉农缺肥困难，石家庄棉产改进指导区、唐山专区供销社、人民银行天津专区支行贷放了大批肥田粉。（陈明善、树春、赵绍周、王德、宋建邦、王光、景仁）
