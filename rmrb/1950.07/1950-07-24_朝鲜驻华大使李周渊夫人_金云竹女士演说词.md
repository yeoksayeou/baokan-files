　　Speech by Kim Un-joo, Wife of Korean Ambassador to China, Lee Joo-yeon
    [Our newspaper's dispatch] I feel very honored to participate in today's meeting. Because the Chinese people, the Chinese women, treat the affairs of the Korean people as their own, you are enthusiastically supporting us!
    The Korean people have never hindered the United States, let alone invaded their territory, but American imperialism is carrying out an unreasonable invasion against the Korean people. They want to throw the Korean people into a sea of blood, want to treat the Korean people as their slaves, and boast that they will destroy Korea in three days. The American imperialists miscalculated. Today, the Korean people have already risen up. We have liberated many cities, many American soldiers have been captured, and many American soldiers have died. The victorious facts of the Korean People's Liberation War over the past month prove that we will never be defeated, and we will continue to achieve even greater victories. We firmly believe that no matter what, the Korean people will never become slaves of American imperialism, because our war is a just, anti-aggression people's liberation war. American imperialism is sinking into a bottomless pit in Korea. The Korean people must drive the American imperialists out of Korea without leaving a single one, to repay the enthusiastic support of the great Chinese people.

    金云竹女士演说词
    【本报讯】朝鲜驻华大使李周渊夫人金云竹女士在北京市妇女反美侵略大会上的演说全文如下：
    我参加今天这个大会觉得非常光荣。因为中国人民，中国的妇女把朝鲜人民的事情当做自己的事情，你们热烈地支援着我们！
    朝鲜人民并没有妨碍过美国，更没有到美国的领土上去侵略他们，但美帝国主义却向朝鲜人民进行无理的侵略，他们想把朝鲜人民扔入血海，想把朝鲜人民当做他们的奴隶，并且夸口要在三天内灭亡朝鲜。美帝估计错了，今天朝鲜人民已经起来了。我们解放了许多城市，许多美军被俘虏了，许多美军死亡了。一个月来朝鲜人民解放战争的胜利事实证明了我们是永远不会被打败的，我们还会继续获得更大的胜利。我们坚信无论什么时候，朝鲜人民都不会成为美帝国主义的奴隶，因为我们的战争是正义的、反侵略的人民解放战争，美帝国主义正在朝鲜陷入无底的深坑。朝鲜人民一定要把美帝国主义一个不留地赶出朝鲜去，来答复伟大中国人民的热烈的声援。
