Beijing's major middle school students are organizing and expanding anti-aggression propaganda

[Our Newspaper] Teachers, students, and staff from major middle schools in Beijing are actively responding to the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea with various practical actions.

The Beijing Student Federation organized over 1,200 students from more than 30 universities and middle schools, including Renmin University, Peking University, the male high school affiliated with Beijing Normal University, and Girls' No. 1 Middle School, into propaganda teams. Starting on the 23rd, these teams were dispatched to urban and suburban areas to conduct propaganda. The propaganda teams used maps of the Korean War situation to explain the situation to citizens, and were accompanied by waist drum teams, singing teams, and cartoons. The propaganda vehicle of Beijing Normal University was active on the main streets of the city, and the propaganda team of Tsinghua University conducted propaganda at a mass meeting in Haidian Town, a suburb of Beijing. Some students also went to the countryside to chat with farmers about the international situation. The audience expressed their belief that the Chinese and Korean people would definitely defeat the American aggressors, and enthusiastically participated in peace signing. An old worker said, "I will definitely step up production to support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan." Another citizen said, "America's armed aggression against Korea will be opposed by people all over the world!" Over a hundred students from Renmin University will go to the suburbs of Beijing, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Nanyuan and other places for propaganda within the next few days.

Renmin University
The Trade Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Communist Youth League, and the Student Union of Renmin University held a rally of over 4,000 people against American imperialist aggression on the afternoon of the 22nd, and invited Huang Caoliang of the Xinhua News Agency to report on the "Korean Question."

Vice President Cheng Fangwu spoke first, pointing out: "American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan and the Korean people is clearly a provocation against the peace-loving people of the world. This behavior has aroused the anger of the Eastern people and the progressive people of the world. The heroic counterattack of the Korean people and the unstoppable military defeat of the American imperialists and their lackeys show the strength of the Korean people and the fragility of the American imperialist paper tiger."

Huang Caoliang pointed out in his report the specific facts that "in just four weeks of fighting, the heroic North Korean People's Army liberated all of two provinces and most of two provinces, liberated more than fifty cities and more than six thousand towns and villages, eliminated 55,000 soldiers of the Rhee Syngman puppet army, eliminated nearly 10,000 American invading troops, and shot down more than 60 American imperialist aircraft." Korean student Wu Jingjun said at the meeting: "The Korean people have the support of the world's peace forces, the Korean people have the tradition of bravely fighting imperialism, and the Korean people have the confidence to drive the aggressors out of the country." The entire faculty and staff of the Cooperation Department of the school presented a silk banner to the Korean People's Army. Finally, in the name of the Renmin University faculty and staff's Anti-American Aggression Movement Congress, telegrams were sent to Chairman Mao, the fathers, brothers, sisters, and elders of the whole country, and General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people. They assured Chairman Mao that they would strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and professional knowledge, and strive to become loyal cadres for the construction of the new China; they called on the fathers, brothers, sisters, and elders of the whole country to strengthen their confidence that the People's Liberation Army could cross the sea to liberate Taiwan, to temporarily endure all hardships, to step up production, to support the front, and to work together to complete the liberation of Taiwan; and to express their infinite respect to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean military and civilians, and to firmly believe that Korea's just war will surely achieve final victory, and that the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world will stand with the Korean people.

Agricultural University
The Agricultural University held a World Peace Preservation Evening Party on the evening of July 21. More than 300 people from 25 units, including the school's eleven departments and station affairs office, Changzhi and Shijiazhuang branch schools, the Chinese Michurin Society, and the Labor Model Research Class, attended the meeting. In the speeches at the meeting, everyone expressed their extreme indignation at the US imperialists' direct attack on the Korean people and their aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan, and everyone firmly believed that the Chinese and Korean people have the strength and confidence to smash the conspiracies of the American aggressors. Wang Yan'an, a student of the Labor Model Research Class and a former labor hero of Licheng in the Taihang area, said based on his experience in eliminating Japanese imperialism during the War of Resistance Against Japan: "The American imperialist paper tiger will collapse soon, just like Japanese imperialism." He proposed to guarantee to learn scientific theories and improve agricultural production in order to defend world peace. Ge Hetang, a former labor hero in the Taiyue area, used the Shangdang Campaign he personally experienced as an example, saying: "In just a few days of fighting, the Chiang and Yan bandit troops supported by the US imperialists were wiped out by our People's Liberation Army at Mopan Mountain. The current US imperialists are no more than a chicken with its throat cut, and they still have to flap their wings for a final struggle before they die."

Peking University
More than 200 students remaining at Peking University and Girls' No. 1 Middle School and Boys' No. 8 Middle School formed 18 propaganda squadrons, which went to the streets of the Second, Fifth, Sixth and Third Districts of Beijing to carry out extensive propaganda to citizens through lectures, songs, dances, and living newspapers. The first team of the Seventh Squadron alone reached more than 1,200 audience members in five propaganda activities.

The propagandists tried their best to use colloquial language to introduce the facts of the US imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and Korea to the citizens, which aroused strong anger among the citizens. An old lady said: "The people in southern Korea are suffering. It's all because of the old Americans. The old Americans are really hateful!" The propagandists also pointed out to the citizens the truth that the US imperialists are bound to be defeated. People's Police (governance) No. 1314 said: "North Korea, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, is just like our China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and it will definitely win!"

The living newspaper received good results. After seeing the heroic Korean People's Army forcing the US imperialists to drop their weapons and flee in embarrassment, the citizens of Gulou shouted loudly, "Long live the victory of the Korean people!" Shoemaker Comrade Qian said: "I only knew that there was a war in Korea, and some said this and some said that. Now I understand; it turns out that the old Americans are causing trouble again!" Zhao Zeton, a comrade from the Automobile Company, said: "The old Americans are bound to fail. We must step up production to support them!"

Tsinghua University
All 27 reading groups at Tsinghua University discussed the Korean War situation in order to deepen their understanding of the international situation. Under the call of the Tsinghua Student Union, students from various departments and grades wrote letters to relatives and friends, propagating the outward strength and inner weakness of American imperialism and the inevitable victory of the joint liberation struggle of the Chinese and Korean people.

On the evening of the 24th, propagandists from Tsinghua University cooperated with the 16th District Government to hold a mass meeting in Haidian Town, a suburb of Beijing, and also carried out propaganda activities in nearby villages. The students used popular lectures and living newspapers to tell the villagers in this area about the facts of the US imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and Korea. These facts aroused great resentment among the farmers.

Yenching University
At 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd, a propaganda team of more than 50 people from Yenching University brought the crimes of the US imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and Korea and the successive victories of the Korean People's Army to Shucun in the 16th District of Beijing's suburbs. The farmers strongly expressed their confidence in liberating Taiwan. The foreign films and crosstalk performed by the propagandists clearly told the farmers about the failures the US imperialists had suffered in Korea. Regarding the victory of the Korean people, Feng Wenliang, a 73-year-old poor peasant, said: "There is nothing surprising about this. Where there is the Communist Party, there is victory!"

Normal University
The Trade Union, the Student Union, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Normal University first launched anti-American aggression propaganda within the school through broadcasts and big-character posters, and then organized a propaganda team to carry out extensive propaganda to the people. The students enthusiastically signed up to participate in this work. In less than an hour, the number of people who signed up reached 117.

When the Normal University students' propaganda vehicle appeared on the street, passers-by stopped, the shop assistants crowded at the entrance of the shops, and women, some holding children and some still holding needlework, ran out of their homes and crowded into the crowd to listen. The loudspeaker broadcasted the news of the Korean People's Army's successive victories and the shameless acts of aggression by American imperialism. At the same time, the students of the propaganda team were scattered among the audience, carrying out propaganda and answering questions in various ways such as talks, propaganda posters, and lectures. The propaganda vehicle with the peace appeal letter was always crowded with people who wanted to sign their names. Women, workers, or children who could not write also enthusiastically asked others to sign their names for them. While promoting at Tianqiao, an old man signed his name and then said to the audience: "Those who want peace and don't want war, come and sign your names!" Even the children selling popsicles and candies on the street left their popsicle carts or left their stalls and ran to sign their names. They all said: "We want to defend world peace!"

Sino-French, Beijing Normal, Baiman, Yu Ying
The propaganda teams formed by the four schools also achieved great results in carrying out street propaganda. After listening to a speech, a citizen said: "Before the liberation of Beijing, American imperialist trucks rushed around on the streets, and killed people without even looking back. We must drive these man-eating bandits out of Asia." After signing her name, an old lady signed the names of her two little nephews whom she was holding and pulling along.

    人民大学
    中国人民大学校工会、中苏友好协会、青年团、学生会等团体于二十二日午后举行了全校四千余人的反对美帝国主义侵略的大会，邀请新华总社黄操良报告“朝鲜问题”。
    首先由成仿吾副校长讲话，指出：“美帝国主义对我国台湾及朝鲜人民的侵略，这显然是向全世界和平人民挑衅，这种行为已激起了东方人民及全世界进步人民的愤怒。朝鲜人民英勇的反攻，美帝国主义者及其走狗在军事上不可遏止的溃败，说明了朝鲜人民的强大和美帝国主义这只纸老虎的脆弱。
    黄操良在报告中指出“仅仅四个礼拜的战斗，英勇的北朝鲜人民军就解放了两个省的全部和两个省的大部，解放了五十多个城市，六千多个村镇，消灭了李承晚伪军五万五千人和消灭美侵略军近一万人，击落了美帝国主义飞机六十余架。”的具体事实。朝鲜同学吴景俊在大会上表示：“朝鲜人民有全世界和平力量的支援，朝鲜人民有和帝国主义英勇斗争的传统，朝鲜人民是有信心将侵略者驱逐出境的。”该校合作系全体学工人员并向朝鲜人民军献锦旗一面。最后并以中国人民大学全体学工人员反对美帝侵略运动大会名义分别向毛主席、全国同胞父老兄弟姊妹们、朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军致电。向毛主席保证要加强马列主义和业务的学习，锻炼成为新中国建设的忠实干部；号召全国父老兄弟姊妹们坚定人民解放军可以渡海解放台湾的信心，暂时忍耐一切艰难困苦，加紧生产，支援前线，为完成解放台湾而共同努力；向金日成将军和朝鲜军民致无限的敬意，并坚信朝鲜正义的战争，必然获得最后的胜利，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一定会和朝鲜人民站在一起。

    北大留校同学二百多人和女一中、男八中等校组成了十八个宣传中队，分别到京市二、五、六三区街头，通过讲演、歌咏、舞蹈、活报剧等方式向市民进行广泛宣传。仅第七中队一队所作五次宣传中，观众即达一千二百人以上。
    宣传员尽量用通俗的口语，向市民介绍了美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜的事实，引起了市民强烈的愤怒。一位老太太说：“朝鲜南边老百姓过得苦，都是老美搞的，老美真可恶！”宣传员也给市民们指出了美帝必败的道理。人民警察（治）一三一四号说：“北朝鲜在金日成将军的领导下，正如咱们中国在毛主席的领导下一样，一定可以取得胜利的！”
    活报剧收到了良好的效果。鼓楼的市民们看到英勇的朝鲜人民军把美帝逼得丢下武器、狼狈而逃之后，都响亮地喊出了“朝鲜人民胜利万岁！”修鞋匠钱同志说：“我只晓得朝鲜在打仗，有的说这样，有的说那样，这下子我可明白了；原来，又是老美在捣鬼！”汽车公司赵泽同同志说：“老美一定要失败的，我们要用加紧生产来支援他们！”

    当师大同学的宣传车在街头出现的时候，过路的人停了下来，商店的店员们簇拥在店铺门口，妇女们有的抱着小孩，有的手里还捏着针线活计就都从家里跑出来，挤到人堆里来听。广播筒响亮地播送着朝鲜人民军节节胜利的消息和美帝国主义的无耻侵略行为。宣传队的同学也同时分散在听众中间，用谈话、宣传画、讲演等各种方式进行宣传和解答问题。在放着和平呼吁书的宣传车的前面，始终挤满了要签名的人。不会写字的妇女、工人或小孩，他们也热情地请旁人代他们签上名字。在天桥宣传的时候，有一位老人签了名以后，就向听众说：“要和平不愿打仗的人快来签名！”就连在街上卖冰棍、卖糖的小孩们，也放下冰棍车或是离开小摊跑来签名。他们都说：“要保卫世界和平！”
