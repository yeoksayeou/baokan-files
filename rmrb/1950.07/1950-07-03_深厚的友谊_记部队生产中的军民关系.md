　　The dry land reclaimed by the machine gun company was already quite extensive; they also wanted to cultivate a few mu of paddy fields, so they could enjoy rice in the future. Coincidentally, there was a piece of land nearby, with long grass growing on the ridges and in the ponds. The machine gun company had been reclaiming wasteland here for over a month, and no one had ever come by; the village cadres designated this area of wasteland entirely for the troops to cultivate. Seeing that no one seemed to be farming this land, the soldiers jumped into the muddy water and started working as soon as the company commander gave the word.

　　Digging paddy fields was a different experience than digging dry land. With their legs submerged in mud, mud and water splashing everywhere, the soldiers were all covered in mud. At midday, the sun was scorching. But the most annoying thing was the "leeches." These creatures were shiny and pointed at both ends, stretching out to the length of a finger, and shrinking into a fleshy ball. Everyone's legs were bitten bloody by them. Nevertheless, in less than half a day, two-thirds of the three-mu paddy field had been reclaimed. The comrades were very happy.

　　At this moment, an old man walked over. He carried a hoe and walked to the edge of the field, suddenly stopping in surprise, saying: "Oh! How did you reclaim my land? I still want to plant it."

　　The soldiers were stunned. Some muttered: "They told us to reclaim it without even investigating. We've been working for half a day for nothing." Some comrades said: "Land has ownership rights, if it’s someone else's land, we have to give it back."

　　After considering it, the instructor said to the old man: "The village cadres said that this land was for the troops to reclaim. As long as the village cadres can prove that it is your land, we will return it to you."

　　The chairman of the farmers' association arrived. He said: "It's my fault for not making it clear to the comrades that only dry land should be reclaimed here. This piece of land belongs to him, that's true." The chairman of the farmers' association added with a smile: "If the comrades want to eat rice, there are plenty of paddy fields, we can find another one." The old man said apologetically: "You've already reclaimed most of it for me. It would take me several days to do it alone. I'll give the comrades a few workdays in return." The comrades quickly explained: "No need, no need, there are many of us, it's nothing." After this incident, the soldiers and the old man became good friends. The old man told everyone he met: "Such good troops are rare in the world! They reclaimed my land and then returned it to me as it was. If it were the Kuomintang reactionaries in power, let alone giving it back, I wouldn't even dare to ask for it."

　　This region had suffered from years of famine in the past, and many fields were left uncultivated. The chairman of the farmers' association successively found seventeen or eighteen mu of paddy fields for the machine gun company. The comrades were full of energy and cleaned them up in five or six days.

　　When it came time to germinate the seeds, the comrades were stumped: who knew there were so many intricacies to planting rice? The old man found out and voluntarily came to tell the comrades: germinating seeds should not be done in salt vats, oil vats, or vinegar vats, and the seeds being germinated should be turned over once a day. The old man was still worried and came to the vat twice a day to check and stir it with a stick. Only when the sprouts had all emerged did he seem to put his mind at ease, saying happily: "Not bad, not bad, we can plant in two or three days."

　　This old man's name is Chang Jilian, and he is fifty years old this year. He is an expert at growing rice, proficient in everything from germinating seeds, raising seedlings, to fertilizing. But he suffered until he was over forty years old, and still didn't own a single piece of land. It was not until he was forty-eight years old that he bought five mu of land with decades of hard-earned savings. During the land reform, he was also allocated seven mu of land and bought a large yellow ox.

　　When it was time to sow the seedlings, the old man came to help the comrades again, and also called a neighbor to help. He treated it completely as if it were his own work, while working with his hands, and pointing out to the comrades how to build the ridges and how to sow the seedlings clearly. After the seedlings were sown, the comrades also learned the technique. Before the rice seedlings were fully grown, the old man applied pigeon manure. In three or four days, the seedlings grew thick and tall. The comrades said excitedly: "Thanks to this old man's skill, we have hope for rice."

　　When working, everyone's meals were delivered to the fields. The comrades from the troops ate the meals sent from home together with the old man's. Every day the old man came to the field, carrying a basket, and before going home he would cut some green grass to feed the ox. When the comrades were resting, they would give him a handful, and he a handful, and soon the basket was full of green grass. The old man grinned with joy.

　　During the midday break, the villagers from the surrounding fields, with their tobacco pipes in their mouths, all gathered at the edge of the army's field to chat. The deep friendship between the military and the people expanded from the old man Chang Jilian and continued to expand to the entire village.

    机炮连开的旱地已经很不少了；他们还想开几亩稻地，将来好吃大米干饭。凑巧挨边就有一块地，田埂上、水池里都长满了很长的草。机炮连在这里开荒一月多，也没见有人来过；村干部指定这一片荒地统统给军队开，看样子这块地是没人种了。连长一说，战士们便跳进这块水地干了起来。
    挖水地和挖旱地的味道可不同。两条腿泡在泥里，泥水飞溅着，战士们个个变成了泥人。晌午，太阳晒得真够受。但最烦人的还是“蚂鳖”。这种东西光油油的两头尖，伸起有指把长，缩起是个肉蛋蛋。每个人的腿，叫它咬得血淋淋的。不管怎样，三亩地的一块稻田，不到半天已开出三分之二啦。同志们十分高兴。
    这时，走来一个老汉。他扛着锄走到地边，猛然一怔，说：“噢！怎么把我的地给开啦？我还要种呀。”
    战士们都楞住了。当时就有人嘟哝起来：“也不调查调查就叫开。开了半天一场空。”有的同志就说：“地有地权，是人家的地得给人家。”
    指导员考虑了一下，对老汉说：“村干部说过，这片地让军队开。只要村干部证明是你的地，我们就还给你。”
    农会主席来了。他说：“怨我当初没给同志们讲明白，这里的地光让开旱地。这块地是他的，不假。”农会主席并笑着说：“同志们想吃大米，稻地有的是，咱另找。”老汉很过意不去地说：“你们给我开了一大半啦。叫我一个人开得好几天。我还同志们几个工吧。”同志们连忙解释：“不用，不用，俺们人多，不值啥。”经过这一闹腾，战士们和老汉倒结成好朋友了。老汉见人就说：“天下少有的好队伍啊！地给开了，又原封给了咱。要是国民党反动派在的时候，别说他不会给你，咱也不敢要呢。”
    这个地区，过去连年灾荒，不少地撩着没人种。农会主席先后给机炮连找到十七、八亩稻地。同志们精神十足，五六天便收拾得停停当当了。
    到泡芽的时候，同志们却作难了：谁知道种稻子有那么多的讲究？老汉知道了，便自动找了来，告诉同志们：泡芽忌用盐缸、油缸、醋缸，泡上的种子要一天翻一回。老汉还放心不下，一天跑来两趟，到缸边看看，用棍子搅搅。直到芽子出齐，他才放下一件心事似的，高兴地说：“不赖不赖，三两天就能种咧。”
    这老汉名字叫常继联，今年五十岁了。他是个种稻的好手，养芽、起秧、施肥……样样精通。但他受苦受到四十多岁，还是一垅地也没有。到四十八岁时，他才用几十年的辛劳积蓄，买了五亩地。土地改革时，他又分到七亩地，还买了一只大黄牛。
    撒芽时，老汉又来帮同志们干活，还叫来一个邻居做帮手。他完全当成自己的活一样，一面动手干，一面将怎样打埂，怎样撒芽给同志们指点个一清二白。芽撒完了，同志们把本事也学会啦。稻秧快要长成以前，老汉又给上鸽粪。三四天光景，秧苗发得又粗又高。同志们兴奋地说：“多亏得了老大爷这把手，大米干饭有希望了。”
    干活时，大家的饭都是送到地里吃的。部队的同志把家里送来的饭和老汉的放在一起吃。老汉每天到地里来，捎着个筐子，回家前要割点青草喂牛。同志们在休息时，便你一把，我一把，一会儿就割了满满一筐青草。喜得老汉咧着嘴直笑。
    歇晌时，左右邻地的老乡们，衔了烟管，都凑到军队的地头上来拉家常。军民的深厚友谊，由常继联老汉扩大开来，一直扩大到整个的村庄。
