　　Liu Zhishan's Land and Housing Problem
    Please Resolve it, Second District Government of Wuyi Editor Comrade:
    I work in the Political Department of the Artillery of the North China Military Region. My home is in Liuliange Village, Second District, Wuyi, Hebei. There are two people in my family (my mother and I), with five mu of land and five rooms. During the land reform, because there was no one at home (my mother was living with relatives), the village cadres distributed all my property to others. When I found out about this, I immediately wrote to the village cadres, stating that I was in the People's Liberation Army (at that time I was studying at North China Military University). But they ignored me. After I got to my work post (Artillery Political Department), the organization wrote four letters to the local government on my behalf, asking them to handle the matter. But there were no results, and they didn't even reply to the letters. It has been almost two years now, and my mother cannot maintain her livelihood at home. Please, Editor Comrade, help me solve this problem.
    Liu Zhishan
    Editor's Note: The Second District Government of Wuyi should find a way to solve the problem of land and housing for Comrade Liu Zhishan's family so that his mother can maintain her livelihood.

　　刘志山家里的土地房屋问题
    请武邑二区政府解决编辑同志：
    我在华北军区炮兵政治部工作，家住河北武邑二区刘连阁村，现有两口人（我和我母亲），地五亩，房五间。在土地改革时，因我家里无人（母亲在亲戚家住），村干部就将我的全部财产分给了别人。我知道这件事情后，立即给村干部写信，声明我在人民解放军里（那时我在华北军大学习）。但他们毫不理睬。我到工作岗位后（炮兵政治部），组织替我给地方政府写了四封信，请他们处理这件事。但亦毫无结果，他们连信也不回。事情到现在将近两年，母亲在家无法维持生活。请编辑同志设法帮助我解决这个问题。
    刘志山
    编者按：刘志山同志家里的土地及房屋问题，武邑二区政府应设法解决，使他的母亲能够维持生活。
