　　Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Area
    Lends Over 160,000 Jin of Fertilizer

    [Report from Shijiazhuang] To support the masses in increasing cotton production, the Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Guidance Area in Hebei Province has lent over 160,000 jin of fertilizer to cotton farmers in Jin County, Gaocheng, Huolu, Zhengding, and the Shijiazhuang Improved Seed Management Area. This included 3,590 jin of ferrous sulfate and 159,887 jin of ferrous nitrate, resolving the fertilizer shortage for cotton farmers in 74 villages in the area. The cotton fields in the counties of this area largely lack humus, so the needed fertilizer is primarily nitrogen-based. Ferrous sulfate contains 20.5% nitrogen, and ferrous nitrate contains 32.2% nitrogen. Both are easily soluble in water, hygroscopic, and easily absorbed and utilized by plants, making them particularly suitable for the area. There are two methods of lending: one is lending, where one jin of fertilizer is lent, and ten liang of seed cotton is returned after the autumn harvest; the other is exchange, where two jin of millet (or wheat) are exchanged for one jin of fertilizer. To facilitate farmers' repayment in kind, and based on voluntary and mutually beneficial terms, one-third of the wheat can be paid first, with the remainder repaid with cotton after the autumn harvest. This method has been warmly welcomed by the masses.

　　石家庄棉产改进指导区
    贷放肥田粉十六万余斤
    【本报石家庄讯】河北省石家庄棉产指导区为扶助群众增产棉花，曾贷放肥田粉十六万余斤给晋县、藁城、获鹿、正定、石家庄良种管理区的棉农，计硫酸亚三千五百九十斤，硝酸亚十五万九千八百八十七斤，解决了该区七十四个村棉农缺肥的困难。该区各县棉田，由于大部土壤缺乏腐植质，所需肥料以氮素为主。硫酸亚含氮素百分之二○点五，硝酸亚含氮素百分之三十二点二，易溶于水，有吸湿性，易为植物吸收利用，对该区特别适用。贷换的方法有两种：一种是贷，即借给一斤肥田粉，秋后收回籽棉十两；一种是换，以二斤小米（或麦子）换一斤肥田粉。为便利农民归还实物，根据自愿两利的条件，可以先交三分之一的小麦，其余秋后还棉。这个办法，受到群众热烈欢迎。
