Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th – Special correspondent of this agency on the Korean front reports: The moment you cross the border into Korea, you immediately feel the spirit of the people here. Every year at this time, the Korean weather is terrible, with rain falling day after day. Rainwater fills the air raid shelters, submerging precious crops. However, through the mist, through the heat and sweat, you can see a people who have stood up and will never be knocked down again. Everyone knows this is a life-and-death struggle, and everyone is involved in the fight.

Less than a month since Syngman Rhee launched the offensive, 1.3 million young people have applied to join the People's Army. On trains and trucks speeding south, on the highways heading south, everywhere are young people singing generous songs. They have embarked on a journey to defend the government managed by the people themselves, to defend all the happy life that this government brings to them.

All Koreans like to wear snow-white clothes. Wherever you are, you can see groups of farmers in white clothes; that is the whole village sending their sons to the front, or waving encouragement to other people's children passing through the area on their way to fight in the south.

When the train is about to arrive at a small station, the whole town swarms to greet it, standing in the rain until the train leaves, and then chasing after it along the tracks. In the end, only a few children, young people, and women are left, still waving, smiling, and sometimes some people even crying. The children present bouquets of flowers to the soldiers. Farmers, farm women, these people who are now the masters of the fields, rush from the valleys and rice paddies to present small gifts to those heading south. All towns implement strict blackout regulations to guard against the constant threat of American air raids – implementing blackout regulations in this weather is really tough, but citizens and workers bury themselves in their work with absolute calmness. They are all calm and confident that the people will defeat the American bandits.

Everywhere in Korea, there is an overwhelming atmosphere: a demand for unification, a deep sense of determination. A soldier of the People's Army on the border told me: "If you have come here to report our situation to the world, then you will find that in the heart of every Korean, there is the same thought: we have been ruled by foreigners for too long, and now we would rather die than live the old life again."

America cannot defeat Korea, because the Korean people will pick up their hammers, pliers, axes, pitchforks, and kitchen knives if necessary, making it impossible for the invaders to survive. Besides, there are still 1.3 million people who have not joined the war! Behind them are millions more waiting to be conscripted, so that they can rush to the south tomorrow.

### 朝鲜人民个个投入战斗  确信必将战胜美国强盗  青年申请参军的已达一百三十万人

　　朝鲜人民个个投入战斗  确信必将战胜美国强盗
    青年申请参军的已达一百三十万人
    【新华社平壤二十日电】本社朝鲜战地特派记者报道：一跨进朝鲜的边境，你立刻就会感觉到这里的人民的精神。年年此时，朝鲜的气候都是非常可怕的，成天地下雨，下了又下。雨水积满防空壕，淹没了宝贵的谷禾。然而，穿过迷雾，透过酷暑和汗水，你可以看出一个已经站立起来而且决不会再被打倒的人民。人人都知道这是一个生死斗争，而且个个都投入了战斗。
    自从李承晚发动进攻以来，还不到一个月，已有一百三十万青年申请参加人民军。在向南疾驰的火车和卡车上，在南下的大路上，满处都是慷慨高歌的青年人。他们踏上了征途，前往保卫由人民自己所管理的政府，保卫这个政府带给他们的一切幸福生活。
    所有的朝鲜人都喜欢穿着雪白的衣裳，你不论在那里，都可以看见一群群的白衣农民；那就是全村的人在送他们的儿子到前方去，或是向路过当地开往南方作战的别人的孩子挥手鼓励。
    在火车快到一个什么小站的时候，全镇的人就都蜂涌前来迎接它，在雨中鹄立着直到车开，然后又沿着路轨在后面追跑，最后只剩下几个小孩、年青人和妇女了，却仍在招手，微笑，有时竟有些人哭起来了。孩子们把一个个花束献给战士。农夫，农妇，这些现在已成了田地的主人的人们，从谷地和稻田上纷纷跑来，向那些奔赴南方的征人馈赠小巧的礼物。所有城镇都实行严格的灯火管制，以防备美机经常的轰炸威胁——在这种天气实行灯火管制可真够受，但市民和工人却绝对镇静地埋头工作，他们都泰然自若，确信人民必将战胜美国强盗。
    朝鲜到处都弥漫着一种压倒一切的气氛：要求统一，深具决心。边境上一个人民军的战士对我说：“如果你到这里来是为了向全世界报道我们的情况的话，那么你就会发觉：每个朝鲜人的心坎里，都存在着同样的思想：我们已经受外国人统治得太久了，现在我们死也不愿再过旧日的生活了。”
    美国不能打败朝鲜，因为朝鲜人民在必要时一定会拿起他们的锤子、钳子、斧头、叉耙和菜刀，叫侵略者过不下去。此外，还有一百三十万人未参加作战呢！在他们后面又有数百万人在等待征召，以便于明天奔赴南方。
