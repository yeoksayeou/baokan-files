　　Tianjin Public Hengda Cigarette Factory Should Abolish the "Body Search" System
    ——Reader Qiu Jing's Letter Criticizes

To the Editor:

    In the Social Service column of the July 18th issue of the Progressive Daily, the Tianjin Public Hengda Cigarette Factory responded to Zhang Jingjun's inquiry regarding the welfare of temporary workers in the factory's warehouse, mentioning that the reason the "body search" system has not yet been abolished is because the temporary workers have not yet proposed "guarantee" conditions. We believe this response is extremely wrong.

    The "body search" system (also known as "searching the body," "searching pockets") is an extreme insult to the dignity of workers by the ruling class in the old society. Any excuse (such as the factory's response requiring so-called "guarantees") to attempt to maintain the existence of this unreasonable system violates Article 5 of the Common Program regarding the right to personal freedom and is, in essence, an insult to the working class.

    Regarding the issue of abolishing body searches, some people believe that the workers' level of awareness is not yet high enough, and individual workers may not comply with labor discipline, so it cannot be abolished yet. However, I believe this concern is unnecessary because the negative effects of body searches are very limited. Facts have proven that the tighter the body searches are, the more resentment they cause among workers. After liberation, I saw many workers celebrating so enthusiastically for the abolition of the "body search" system. The joy in their hearts is imaginable! At the grand meeting of the Tianjin Textile Factories to abolish body searches, the workers resolutely expressed that they would regard the factory's property as their own. One worker said, "The People's Government respects the dignity of workers, and the workers understand this in their hearts!" These are such sincere words! What reason do we have not to trust our worker brothers? As far as I know, there are two large-scale cotton mills, one public and one private, in West Shanghai. Last year, the public mill abolished body searches, while the private mill conducted them as tightly as before liberation. As a result, the private mill discovered hundreds of theft cases in three months, while in the public mill, due to workers' voluntary reporting, theft cases became extremely rare.

    The body search system should be abolished unconditionally. Of course, this cannot guarantee that no one will violate labor discipline. The main thing is to continuously educate and persuade individual backward workers so that everyone can establish a sense of ownership and understand that the factory belongs to the people and that they themselves are the masters of the factory. I believe that only in this way can the new labor discipline be guaranteed.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Qiu Jing's opinion is correct. In the various factories and mines of New China, this barbaric "body search" system that insults the working class should no longer be retained. Today, the working class is the leading class of the country, and the workers are the masters of state-owned and public factories. Such insults cannot be tolerated. It should be understood that the reason why some workers stole before liberation was entirely due to the ruling class's cruel exploitation and oppression of the workers, making it impossible for them to survive. Continuing this system from the old society today makes no sense. This will inevitably alienate the factory leadership from the workers, prevent the workers' enthusiasm for production from being brought into play, and hinder the rapid development of the country's economic construction. The responsible comrades of the Hengda Cigarette Factory should thoroughly correct this.

### 天津公营恒大烟厂应取消“搜腰”制度——读者邱靖来信批评

　　天津公营恒大烟厂应取消“搜腰”制度           
    ——读者邱靖来信批评编辑同志：
    七月十八日进步日报社会服务栏发表了天津公营恒大烟厂答复张静君询问该厂仓库有关临时工福利的问题中，提到“搜腰”制度至今尚未废除的原因，是因为临时工尚未提出“保证”的条件。我们认为这个答复是极端错误的。
    “搜腰”制度（又名“抄身”、“抄腰包”），是旧社会统治阶级对工人人格的一种极端侮辱。采取任何借口（如该厂答复的要求所谓“保证”问题），以企图保留这种不合理制度的存在，是侵犯共同纲领第五条关于人身自由的权利，而实质上是侮辱工人阶级。
    关于取消抄身制问题，一部分人认为目前工人的觉悟程度还不够高，可能有个别工人不遵守劳动纪律。所以还不能取消。但我认为这种过虑是不必要的，因为抄身制所发生的消极效果是很有限度的。事实证明，抄身制执行得愈紧，只能引起工人的反感。解放后，我见到许多工人为了废除“搜腰”制度而那么的狂欢。这种内心的高兴是可以想像的！在天津中纺各厂废除抄身制的隆重大会上，工人群众是那么坚决地表示他们要把厂里的财产看成是自己的一样。有一个工人说：“人民政府尊重工人人格，工人自己心里明白！”这是多么真诚的话！我们有什么理由不信任工人兄弟？据我所知道的：上海沪西有公私营纱厂各一家（规模都很大）。去年公营厂废除了抄身制，而私营厂则像解放前一样抄得很紧，结果私营厂在三个月里发现了偷盗事件数百起，而公营厂在工人自动地检举下，偷盗的事件成为绝无仅有的事情了。
    抄身制应该无条件的予以取消。当然这并不可能保证没有一个人违反劳动纪律的。主要的是在于对个别落后的工友采取不断的教育和说服，使大家都能树立起主人翁的态度，明白工厂是属于人民，同时自己就是工厂的主人。我相信只有如此，新的劳动纪律才能得到保证。
                                           读者邱靖
    编者按：邱靖同志的意见是正确的。在新中国的各个工厂、矿山中，不应该再保留这种野蛮的侮辱工人阶级的“搜腰”制度。今天，工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，工人就是国营和公营工厂的主人，不能容许这种侮辱。应该懂得，解放以前一部分工人其所以偷盗，完全是由于统治阶级对工人实行残酷的剥削压榨，工人无法生活的结果。今天因袭旧社会这种制度，是没有任何道理的。这必然会使工厂的领导方面脱离工人群众，工人生产积极性不能发挥，阻碍国家经济建设事业迅速发展。恒大烟厂负责同志应该对此加以彻底纠正。
