Reader's Voice

　　A letter from Beijing Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School pointed out: "Now is the time when graduating students from various middle schools are preparing for graduation and further education. Some speculative publishing merchants are taking advantage of this opportunity and the students' psychology of taking shortcuts in order to make profits by publishing irresponsible 'Further Education Guidance' books." They also pointed out that Beijing Jianye Bookstore published a "Junior Middle School Further Education Guidance"; when promoting it, they also said that "this book has been reviewed by the Ministry of Education and is being sold by Xinhua Bookstore on commission." The letter further pointed out many errors in this book—errors in viewpoints, editing, and proofreading. They also said: "We believe that the attitude of promoting irresponsible books under the banner of our people's regime should also be corrected."

　　In addition, a reader, Mr. Wu Yusheng, also wrote to us, saying that he bought the "Elementary School Further Education Guidance" published by Beijing Wanguo Bookstore, and found that the content and proofreading of the book were "full of errors and unreadable," "causing great harm to students."

　　We carefully compared the two books and agree with the opinions of the two letter writers above. If we were to point out all the errors in the books in detail, it would certainly help readers and publishers; however, the space in this publication is limited, and it is impossible to do so. In fact, this is not only a problem of publishing work; in essence, it is still an educational problem left over from the old era. The various unreasonable situations in the education of the old era provided conditions for vulgar publishers to market these crudely made things. We believe that teachers can seize this practical material to conduct extensive education among the student masses.

　　A letter from a reader with the pseudonym "A Reader" said: "The dictionaries and thesauruses sold in general book stalls and bookstores in Beijing still have very inappropriate content. For example, the 'Youth Five-Use Dictionary' (compiled by Huang Zeren) published by Beijing Bookstore and the 'New Dictionary of Knowledge' (by Hu Lizhi) published by Lizhi Bookstore have many errors in content, including political errors, cultural errors, and proofreading errors. These dictionaries are not only useless to readers, but also harmful. I hope that publishers will consider the interests of readers when publishing books, and not be so irresponsible and publish books randomly." Although this reader did not sign their name, we agree with their opinion.

　　Mr. Ye Jiajun, who works at the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, after reading the "New Map of the People's Republic of China" published by Sanlian Bookstore in April of this year, discovered that many railway lines were drawn that did not match the actual situation. He pointed them out in detail. Finally, he said: "Of course, it is very difficult to compile a perfect map at present. However, the current railway situation is still easy to understand, and the Ministry of Railways can provide more accurate information. I hope the editors will consider quickly correcting these shortcomings."

　　We have forwarded the original letter to Sanlian Bookstore for reference and correction, and take this opportunity to call the attention of other map compilers.

　　In addition, a reader, Mr. Chen Yirong, pointed out that there were many errors in the "Latest Beijing Map" compiled by Shao Chongyue. We also hope that the original compiler will carefully re-examine it.

　　Reader Zhang Shantong said: "We have an opinion on the current publishing industry, that is: there are too few books on natural sciences, especially popular works." "Now one of the important tasks of our country's natural science workers is to systematically introduce the knowledge of production struggle accumulated by advanced countries—the Soviet Union—to cooperate with the current learning movement and for practical work reference." "I hope that natural science workers and the General Administration of Publications and publishers will pay attention to this issue."

　　Editor's note: We want to report to our readers on the handling of manuscripts. As soon as we receive readers' manuscripts or letters, we usually process them immediately. Manuscripts that are not intended for publication will be returned to the authors in a short period of time; or forwarded to the publisher or author for reference, and the author will be notified at the same time. However, for manuscripts that are decided to be published or considered for publication, sometimes it is necessary to delay for a long time in order to forward them to the original author or translator for reply, or to match the space of this publication; at the same time, because the final processing method cannot be decided immediately, we often cannot tell the author this situation in advance, which makes the author wait anxiously, we feel very sorry, and hope the authors will forgive us.

　　Many entries for "Good Books I Have Read" have been received. We have created a special column "Good Book Recommendations" to publish them. Two articles have been published in the last issue. This issue publishes "Three Popularized Historical Readings" by Peng Ming. We will continue to publish them one after another, and we still hope that readers will actively contribute.

专栏：读者之声

　　读者之声
    北京市立女二中来信指出：“现在正是各中学毕业班同学准备毕业和升学的时候，有些投机的出版商人利用这个时机和同学们走捷径的心理，为了营利而出版了不负责任的所谓《升学指导》一类书籍”。并且指出：北京建业书店出了一种《解放初中升学指导》；在推销的时候，还说“这本书是经过教育部审查而且是由新华书店代销的”。来信更指出这一本书中的许多错误——观点上的错误和编辑、校勘上的错误。并且说：“像这样打着我们人民政权的招牌推销不负责任的图书的态度，我们认为也应当予以纠正。”
    另外，还有一位读者吴雨生先生也投书给我们，说他买了北京万国书店出版的《高小升学指导》，发觉该书内容和校勘上都是“错误百出，不堪卒读”，“贻害学生甚大”。
    我们细细地对照了两本书，对于上面两起投书人的意见是同意的。如果我们详细指出书中所有的错误，固然可以帮助读者和出版者；但是本刊篇幅有限，不可能这样做。其实这不仅是出版工作上的问题；在本质上，还是一个旧时代遗留下的教育问题。旧时代教育上种种不合理的情形，为庸俗的出版商提供了行销这些粗制滥造的东西的条件。我们以为各位教师正可以抓紧这一实际资料在学生群众中广泛地进行一番教育。
     有一位署名《一读者》的来信说：“北京市内一般书摊及书店所出售的字典、辞书，仍有内容很不妥当的。例如北京书店出版的《青年五用辞典》（黄泽人编纂）和励志书店的《知识新辞典》（胡立知编），内容错误甚多，政治上的错误、文化上的错误、校订上的错误都有。这些辞典，对读者不但无益，而且是有害的。我希望出版家在出书的时候要顾到读者的利益，不要这样不负责任，乱出一阵。”这位读者虽没有署名，我们是同意他的意见的。
    有一位在铁道部工务总局工作的叶家骏先生，看了本年四月三联书店发行的《中华人民共和国新地图》，发现了画有许多与实际情况不符的铁路线。他很详细地指了出来。最后并说道：“固然，目前要编绘十分完善的地图是很困难的。但是目前铁路的情况还容易了解，铁道部是可以供给较正确的资料的。希望编者考虑迅速纠正这些缺点。”
    我们已将原信转给三联书店参考改正，并借此唤起其他地图编绘者的注意。
    另外还有一位读者陈以荣先生指出邵崇越编的《最新北京大地图》上面有许多错误的地方。我们也希望原编者精确地把它重行审订一下。
     读者张善同先生说：“我们对于目前出版界有一个意见，就是：关于自然科学的书籍出得太少了，尤其是通俗性的作品更少。”“现在我国自然科学工作者的重大任务之一，是将先进国家——苏联所积累下来的生产斗争知识，有系统地介绍过来，以配合当前的学习运动和作实际工作的参考。”“希望自然科学工作者和出版总署及各出版家，对于这个问题加以重视。”
     编者附带声明：我们要向读者报告一下关于稿件处理的情形。我们一收到读者的来稿或来信，通常立即处理。不预备刊载的文稿，短期内就寄还给作者；或转寄出版者、著作者参考，同时也就通知作者。但对决定刊载或考虑刊载的稿件，有时为转寄原著译者答复，有时为配合本刊的篇幅，不能不延搁好些时候；同时因为最后处理的办法不能即作决定，以致往往不能预先将这情形告诉作者，有劳作者盼望，我们觉得很抱歉，并希望作者们原谅。
     《我读过的好书》的应征文稿，已经收到很多篇。我们特辟《好书推荐》栏刊载。上期已经刊出了两篇。本期发表了彭明写的《三本通俗化历史读物》。以后当陆续发表，仍希望读者们踊跃投稿。
