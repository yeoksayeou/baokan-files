Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The discredited Japanese cabinet of Yoshida Shigeru played a reorganization trick on June 28th. On the 27th, all cabinet members of the Yoshida cabinet, except for Yoshida himself, unanimously submitted their resignations. On the 28th, Yoshida quickly formed his new cabinet. Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 28th dispatch: "Observers can see no difference in the nature of the new cabinet from the previous one. Almost all ministerial positions are held by supporters of Yoshida within the Liberal Party." According to Associated Press and Kyodo News Agency Tokyo reports: the new cabinet members are as follows: Yoshida Shigeru remains Prime Minister and Foreign Minister; Finance Minister Ikeda Hayato, who recently went to the United States to engage in traitorous activities; Education Minister Amano Teiyu, who has consistently adopted repressive measures against the student democratic movement; Construction Minister Masuda Kaneshichi; and Health and Welfare Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Hayashi Joji, all remain in their posts. Of the nine new cabinet members, apart from Electrical Communications Minister Tamura Bunkichi (a member of the House of Councillors) who belongs to the Green Breeze Society, a group of nobles, bureaucrats, and conservative scholars, the other eight are all Liberal Party members: Justice Minister Ohashi Takeo (member of the House of Representatives), Agriculture and Forestry Minister Hirokawa Kozen (former Liberal Party Secretary-General), Commerce and Industry Minister Yokoo Ryu (President of Harima Shipbuilding), Transportation Minister Yamazaki Takeshi (member of the House of Representatives, Liberal Party advisor), Labor Minister Hori Shigeru, State Minister and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board Shuto Hideo (Liberal Party Policy Research Council Advisor and Director-General), and State Ministers Kurokawa Takeo (Chairman of the House of Councillors Budget Committee) and Okano Kiyohide (member of the House of Representatives). In addition, three State Minister positions remain vacant.

Before this cabinet reshuffle, the Liberal Party attempted to entice various opposition conservative parties with cabinet positions to abandon their promise to voters during the House of Councillors election for an overall peace treaty, promote the so-called "supra-partisan diplomacy," and jointly organize a so-called "anti-communist peace cabinet" that would engage in separate peace negotiations, attempting, under the guise of peace, to facilitate the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States. During his visit to Japan, US State Department senior advisor Dulles also advocated for a "supra-partisan foreign policy," attempting to win the cooperation of various conservative and reactionary Japanese parties. However, the Socialist Party and others, given Yoshida's and his policies' loss of popular support, hesitated to join a coalition government. Therefore, Yoshida Shigeru, under the banner of a "peace cabinet," carried out a personnel exchange between his government and his Liberal Party, and deliberately left three State Minister positions vacant as bait to continue enticing opposition conservative parties to join the cabinet in "cooperation."

　　伪装媾和以利美帝长期占领日本
    吉田内阁玩弄改组把戏
    各大臣职位仍为反动分子把持
    【新华社二日讯】丧失人心的日本吉田茂内阁，于六月二十八日玩了一次改组的把戏。二十七日，吉田内阁全体阁员，除了吉田本人以外，一致提出辞呈。二十八日，吉田就迅速地组成了他的新内阁。法新社东京二十八日电称：“观察家在新内阁中看不出与前届内阁在性质上有任何区别。几乎各个大臣职位都由自由党内拥护吉田的人所把持”。据美联社与共同社东京讯：新阁的人选如下：吉田茂仍任首相兼外相，最近曾赴美国进行卖国活动的藏相（即财政大臣）池田勇人、对学生民主运动一贯采取镇压手段的文相（即教育大臣）天野贞祐、建设相增田甲子七及厚生相兼副首相林让治，一律留任。新任的九个阁员，除了电气通信相田村文吉（参议员）属于贵族、官僚与保守学者集团的绿风会以外，其他八人都是自由党党员，他们是：法务府总裁大桥武夫（众议员），农林相广川弘禅（前任自由党干事长），通商产业相横尾龙（播磨造船所社长）、运输相山崎猛（众议员、自由党顾问）、劳工相堀茂、国务相兼经济安定本部长官周东英雄（自由党政务调查会顾问兼总务）以及国务相（即无任所大臣）黑川武雄（参议院预算委员会主席）与冈野清豪（众议员）。此外还有三个国务相人选未定。
    自由党在这次内阁改组以前，曾企图以阁员位置引诱各在野保守党派背弃它们在参院选举时对选民所作的主张全面和约的诺言，推行所谓“超党派外交”，联合组织从事单独媾和的所谓“反共媾和内阁”，企图在媾和的伪装下，便利美国长期占领日本。美国国务院高级顾问杜勒斯在访日期间，亦曾为“超党派外交政策”鼓吹，企图拉拢日本各保守反动党派合作。但是，社会党等鉴于吉田及其政策的失尽民心，对联合组阁都犹豫不前。因此，吉田茂就在“媾和内阁”的宣传下，进行了一次他的政府与他的自由党之间的人事交流，并且故意空留三个国务相的职位，作为继续引诱在野保守党派入阁“合作”的钓饵。
