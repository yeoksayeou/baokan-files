Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th. The Korean Workers' Party's newspaper, "Rodong Sinmun," published an editorial on the 22nd commenting on the victory of liberating Daejeon. The editorial stated: The People's Army's victory in Daejeon is another great victory after the liberation of Seoul. This victory opens the way for the People's Army to rapidly advance into the Hunan (Jeolla North Province and Jeolla South Province) and Yeongnam (Gyeongsang North Province and Gyeongsang South Province) regions. The enemy's crushing defeat in Daejeon has plunged the US-Syngman Rhee forces into an irretrievable situation, thereby further shortening the time to finally eliminate the enemy.

The editorial continued: In this battle, the various branches of the People's Army once again demonstrated its invincibility and heroism. In particular, the People's Air Force, in fierce battles with the numerically superior US Air Force, continuously shot down enemy planes, effectively protecting the advance of ground forces and enabling the entire campaign to achieve a glorious victory.

However, this victory must not allow us to become complacent or dizzy with success. The more the enemy fails, the more they will struggle and resist in their death throes. The recent indiscriminate bombing and strafing in our vast rear areas are the frantic acts of the enemy in the face of crushing defeats on the front lines. Therefore, the people of the whole country should further heighten their hatred and vigilance against the enemy.

The editorial pointed out: Any frantic bombing by the enemy cannot weaken the endless fighting power of our people, nor can it stop the People's Army's surging offensive. On the contrary, it can only further increase the common hatred and determination of our army and people to eliminate the enemy. This victory of the People's Army in Daejeon is a powerful answer from the Korean people to the bestial atrocities of US imperialism.

We will relentlessly pursue the enemy and completely eliminate them in Daegu, Mokpo, Busan, Jeju Island and other places.

The editorial concluded: The final victory of the Korean people is in sight. The flag of the Republic will soon be planted all over Korea. Glory to the heroic and invincible Korean People's Army!

    解放大田开辟南进道路  缩短最后消灭敌人时间
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》报二十二日发表社论评论解放大田的胜利。社论称：人民军在大田的胜利是汉城解放后的另一个大胜利。这一胜利开辟了人民军迅速向湖南（全罗北道与全罗南道）与岭南（庆尚北道与庆尚南道）地区进攻的道路。敌人在大田的惨败，促使美、李敌军陷于无法挽救的境地，从而更缩短了最后消灭敌人的时间。
    社论继称：人民军各兵种部队在这一战斗中，又显出了它的无敌性和英勇性，特别是人民空军在和数量上占优势的美空军的激战中，曾不断击落敌机，有效地掩护地面部队前进，使整个战役取得了光辉的胜利。
    但这一胜利绝不容许我们麻痹和冲昏头脑。敌人越失败就越要作垂死的挣扎与反抗。近来在我广大后方进行盲目轰炸与扫射，即是敌人在前线遭到惨败的疯狂行为。因此全国人民应更加提高对敌人的憎恨和警惕。
    社论指出：敌人任何疯狂的轰炸，决不能减弱我们人民无穷无尽的战斗力，也决不能阻挡我人民军怒涛似的进攻，相反地，只能更增加我军民的同仇敌忾和消灭敌人的决心。这次人民军在大田的胜利，就是朝鲜人民对美帝国主义野兽暴行的有力回答。
    我们将不停息地追击敌人，在大邱、木浦、釜山、济州岛等地把敌人彻底消灭干净。
    社论结语称：朝鲜人民的最后胜利就在眼前。共和国的国旗不久即将插遍朝鲜全境。光荣归于英勇无敌的朝鲜人民军！
