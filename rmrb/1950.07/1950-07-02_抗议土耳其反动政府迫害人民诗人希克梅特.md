　　Protest the Turkish Reactionary Government's Persecution of People's Poet Hikmet
    The Turkish reactionary government is brutally persecuting the great revolutionary patriotic poet of Turkey, Nazım Hikmet. Because of the poet's revolutionary poems and communist beliefs, the reactionary government fabricated charges and illegally sentenced him to a long-term solitary confinement of twenty-eight years and four months. The poet has been imprisoned for twelve years. Due to long-term torture, he suffers from a serious heart disease and is in critical condition. The reactionary Turkish government has not only refused the poet's request to be released from prison for medical treatment, but has intensified its efforts by transferring him to another place of imprisonment, completely isolating him from the outside world, and plotting to continue persecuting the poet to death!
    We believe that the Turkish reactionary government's persecution of the revolutionary patriotic poet Hikmet is a completely barbaric fascist atrocity. As is well known, the Turkish reactionary government, under the patronage of American imperialism, attempts to persecute and kill patriotic elements wherever it can, in order to clear the obstacles to its traitorous dictatorial rule.
    But the world's forces of peace and democracy are becoming increasingly consolidated and expanded, and the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Turkish reactionary government, will ultimately be shattered!
    We protest this atrocity by the Turkish reactionary government. Chinese poets express their sincere admiration and sympathy for the patriotic behavior and excellent works of the Turkish poet Hikmet. We support the solidarity actions of the Paris International Committee for the Defense of Hikmet and demand the immediate restoration of poet Hikmet's freedom!

　　抗议土耳其反动政府迫害人民诗人希克梅特
    土耳其反动政府残暴迫害土耳其伟大的革命的爱国诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特。为了诗人的革命诗作与共产主义信仰，反动政府捏造罪名，非法判决了他二十八年零四个月的长期单独监禁。诗人被囚禁在狱中已经十二年了。由于长期的摧残，他患了严重的心脏病，生命垂危。而反动的土耳其政府，非但拒绝了诗人出狱治病的要求，近且变本加厉，将他转移了监禁的地方，竟把他与外界完全隔离起来，阴谋地想继续迫害诗人至死！
    我们认为土耳其反动政府对于革命的爱国诗人希克梅特的迫害，完全是横蛮的法西斯暴行。如所周知，土耳其反动政府在美帝国主义的豢养下，企图在其力之所及的地方，将爱国分子加以迫害与格杀，以便扫清其卖国独裁统治的障碍。
    但世界的和平民主力量，日益巩固扩大，美帝及其走狗土耳其反动政府的阴谋终将被粉碎！
    我们抗议土耳其反动政府的这种暴行，中国的诗人们对于土耳其诗人希克梅特的爱国行为以及他的优秀作品，热诚地表示敬佩和同情。我们拥护巴黎保卫希克梅特国际委员会的声援的行动，要求立即恢复诗人希克梅特的自由！
