　　The State Council and its Affiliated Departments Inspect and Streamline Economy Efforts

　　[Our Newspaper News] The inspection of streamlining and economy efforts in the State Council and its affiliated departments is actively underway. The State Council itself implemented the spirit of leaders taking responsibility and personally taking action, carried out specific mobilization and organizational work, and everyone from top to bottom was mobilized. They organized four groups: the first group inspects staffing and the working conditions and attitudes of cadres; the second group inspects housing construction and car usage; the third group inspects the use of housing and furniture; and the fourth group inspects budgets, expenditure, daily necessities, and conference receptions. Each group has responsible comrades participating and has established relatively detailed plans and specific divisions of labor. Everyone from top to bottom is very serious about the inspection work. When studying relevant documents on streamlining and economy, they can grasp the center: such as studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, with particular emphasis on the third condition pointed out by Chairman Mao for striving for a fundamental improvement in financial and economic conditions: greatly reducing the expenditures of state organs. In order to make the inspection work better, the third group also invited an engineer from the Financial and Economic Committee to participate and help study some issues related to construction. In addition, a secretariat was organized to manage the daily work and the liaison with various departments; a wall newspaper was also published, making the inspection of streamlining and economy efforts the center of current organizational activities. The leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee also paid great attention to the inspection of streamlining and economy efforts, and immediately paid attention to saving expenses after the inspection work began: such as reducing the costs of cigarettes and tea at some meetings. The Ministry of Railways combined the inspection of streamlining and economy efforts with the anti-bureaucratic study and inspection they are conducting. On the 18th, Vice Minister Wu Jingttian made a mobilization report, and the organization was established that afternoon. Except for some departments that were busy holding professional conferences and other special circumstances, most departments have carried out mobilization work on the inspection of streamlining and economy efforts and established inspection organizations. On the 24th, the State Council's Streamlining and Economy Group held its third meeting, and discussed some issues in carrying out the inspection work. (Li)
