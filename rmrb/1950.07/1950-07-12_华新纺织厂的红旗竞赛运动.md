　　The Red Flag Competition Movement at Huaxin Textile Factory
    Zhao Sen
    The Huaxin Textile Factory, a joint public-private enterprise in Tangshan, launched the Red May Competition on May 15th.

    Before the competition, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Competition Committee, the factory's leading cadres corrected the incorrect thinking of overemphasizing difficulties or downplaying them, transformed the work style of one-size-fits-all work, with only deployment and no inspection, only propaganda and no mobilization, re-evaluated the strength of the masses and cadres, established the Huaxin Competition Branch and branches in each unit, formulated a competition plan and implementation steps and methods, specifically divided the work of cadres, went deep into the workshops, and organized and promoted the masses to participate in the competition movement. This was the main key to the development of the factory's competition movement.

    Under the slogan of "Consolidate Output, Improve Quality," all employees have made significant achievements since the launch of the Red Flag Competition between individuals, and between workshops. For example, the average output of the cloth weaving machines in the cloth factory from May 15th to 28th was 39.2 yards per machine, exceeding the original plan by 0.4 yards; the rate of substandard cloth decreased from 13 percent to 6.16 percent. Among them, the most outstanding in production was worker Pan Aizhen, whose average output since the competition has been over 41 yards, with a substandard cloth rate of only 2.7 percent. The Hua character team in the yarn factory's reeling workshop also increased its output from 6,000-7,000 pounds per day to over 9,100 pounds; the number of skilled workers who could reel over 50 vehicles per shift also increased from over ten to forty-one; the number of those who could reel over 60 vehicles also increased from one to four.

    Huaxin's Red Flag movement has gone through a tortuous process. In the first stage of the competition movement, due to the leading cadres falling behind the masses, many problems occurred: (1) Due to the lack of extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization work, some workers were afraid that checking would reveal their poor performance, leading to wage cuts or reorganization; some workers' machines were marked with red flags, but the workers did not know their achievements, and others did not know "why he was given a flag." (2) Individual administrative personnel formulated a set of inspection standards according to the book, which were implemented without discussion by the masses, coupled with the poor attitude of individual inspectors, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers with the inspectors; at the same time, because the inspection did not form a mass movement, the inspection system easily became a formality. (3) Due to untimely rewards in the past, workers' ideological concerns were aroused, affecting the improvement of production. (4) Many workshop cadres were detached from the masses, so the masses were not fully mobilized. (5) In the competition, excessive emphasis was placed on increasing labor intensity, making workers too tired, and the number of sick people increased. (6) Technical personnel were not organized into the competition, and technology was affected.

    In response to the above shortcomings, the factory made a profound review in the initial summary of the first stage of the movement (May 15th to 28th), and clearly stated that only by fully relying on the masses can the competition movement be further developed. Therefore, the leading cadres first submitted the model evaluation regulations they had drafted and the inspection standards that had been unacceptable to the masses to the masses for discussion and modification. At the same time, a mass model evaluation movement was launched. Through this movement, the workers were generally educated, the purely economic (reward) views of individual workers were broken, and the inspection system for product quantity and quality was improved. At the same time, celebration and award ceremonies were held on June 9th, 10th, and 11th respectively, which boosted the workers' production enthusiasm, dispelled their ideological concerns, and also made the relationship between the workshop cadres and the masses closer than before, so that the competition movement moved to a new stage.

    Using brains, encouraging inventions and creations, and improving technology and working methods have become the competition slogans for consolidating and expanding the victory of Red May. After more than a week of brewing and organization, the movement has been on the right track, and the competition has shifted from excessive labor intensity to a competition of intelligence. The yarn factory's technical personnel have been divided into four technical inspection groups, combined with veteran workers to inspect machines and product quality. The cloth factory's maintenance committee, combined with the patrol team leaders, is studying how to eliminate substandard cloth; the radio, repair, and construction departments have also formulated plans to improve their work. The yarn factory is currently studying the transformation of the roving frame, so that the production process can bypass the number two machine. After research, the old cloth weaving machines have been equipped with braking devices, overcoming the problems of frequent yarn breakage and substandard cloth on the old machines. Repair workers Huang Yunming and others have researched and used the waste carbon essence iron joining method to save calcium carbide and oxygen, thus achieving a significant increase in product quantity and quality. For example, according to statistics from the cloth factory from June 6th to 15th: the Huaxin team won the red flags in each group, the new machines eliminated substandard cloth, and the substandard cloth rate of the old machines was only about 7 percent. Statistics from the 12th to 14th show that the average output of the new machines was 41.05 yards (standard 40), with a substandard cloth rate of 2.99 percent (standard 3.5); the average output of the old machines was 36.55 yards (standard 36), with a substandard cloth rate of 7.88 percent (standard 8.5), breaking the record since the competition.

    At present, the urgent problems to be solved in the competition are to do a good job in the monthly model evaluation work, establish a regular reward system; thoroughly improve the organization of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, and clarify their normal relationship; widely carry out the rationalization proposal movement, establish a factory management committee, and further implement democratic management; universally promote contact contracts and master-apprentice contracts; and strengthen propaganda and education work and the training of advanced workers to consolidate and expand the results of the competition.

　　华新纺织厂的红旗竞赛运动
    赵森
    唐山公私合营华新纺织工厂从五月十五日起展开红五月竞赛。
    竞赛前，该厂领导干部在市委和市竞赛委员会的领导下，纠正了过分强调困难或轻视困难的不正确思想，转变了工作中有布置没检查、光宣传不动员的一揽子工作作风，重新估计了群众与干部的力量，成立了华新竞赛分会与各单位支会，作出竞赛计划与进行步骤和方法，将干部具体分工，深入到车间，组织与推动群众投入竞赛运动。这是该厂竞赛运动开展起来的主要关键。
    全体职工在“巩固产量，提高质量”的口号下，展开个人与个人、车间与车间的红旗竞赛以来，作出了显著成绩。如布厂布机间五月十五日至二十八日的平均产量为每台三九点二码，超过原计划○点四码；次布率由百分之十三降低到百分之六点一六。其中生产最突出的是工友潘爱珍，竞赛以来平均产量为四一码以上，次布率仅占百分之二点七。纱厂摇纱间华字班产量也由日产六、七千磅增加到九千一百多磅；全班摇五十车以上的能手，也由十余人增加到四十一人；能摇六十车以上的也由一人增加到四人。
    华新的红旗运动，是经过了曲折的过程的。在竞赛运动开展的第一阶段，由于领导干部落在群众的后面，发生了不少问题：（一）由于宣传鼓动工作没有广泛深入，有的工友怕检查出自己成绩不好，被减工资或被整编下去；有的工友的机器被插上红旗，工友还不知道自己的成绩，别人有的也不知道“为啥给他插旗”。（二）个别行政人员按书本制订一套检查标准，不通过群众讨论即执行，加之个别检查人员态度不好，引起工友对检查人员的不满；同时由于检查没有形成群众运动，致使检查制度容易流于形式。（三）由于以往奖励不及时，引起工友的思想顾虑，影响了提高生产。（四）不少车间干部脱离群众，因此群众没有充分发动起来。（五）在竞赛中过分的强调了提高劳动强度，使工友过于劳累，病号加多。（六）没有把技术人员也组织到竞赛中，技术受到影响。
    针对以上缺点，该厂在运动第一阶段（五月十五至二十八日）的初步总结中作了深刻的检讨，明确提出：只有充分依靠群众，竞赛运动才能更进一步地发展。于是领导干部首先将自己所拟定的评模条例与过去为群众所不能接受的检查标准交由群众讨论并加以修改。同时，展开群众性的评模运动，通过这一运动，普遍地教育了工友，打破了个别工友的单纯经济（奖）观点，健全了产品数量与质量的检查制度。同时于六月九、十、十一三天分别召开了庆功发奖大会，鼓舞了工友们的生产情绪，解除了工友们的思想顾虑，同时使车间干部与群众的关系也较前密切了，使竞赛运动走向新的阶段。
    开动脑筋，鼓励发明创造，改进技术与工作方法，就变成巩固与扩大红五月胜利的竞赛口号。经过一周多的酝酿和组织，运动已纳入正轨，由过分提高劳动强度的竞赛转入智慧竞赛。纱厂技术人员已分成四个技术检查组，结合老工友检查机器和产品质量。布厂由保全委员结合着看车组长研究消灭次布；电台、修机、营缮等部门也都订了改进工作的计划。现纱厂正在研究改造粗纱机，如成功后，生产过程中就可不经二号车。布厂老车经过研究按装了制动装置，克服了老车断头多、次布多的毛病。修机工人黄允明等两人研究利用废炭精接铁法，节省电石和氧气，因此在产品数量与质量上有了显著的提高。如布厂自六月六日至十五日统计：华新班争得红旗各组，新车都消灭了次布，老车次布率也仅占百分之七上下。十二日至十四日统计：新车平均产量四一点零五码（标准四十），次布率为百分之二点九九（标准三点五）；老车平均产量三六点五五码（标准三六），次布率七点八八（标准八点五），打破了竞赛以来的纪录。
    目前竞赛中急待解决的问题，就是很好的作好月终评模工作，建立经常奖励制度；彻底健全党、政、工、团的组织，与明确其正常关系；广泛地开展合理化建议运动，成立工厂管理委员会，进一步实行民主管理；普遍推广联系合同与师徒合同；加强宣教工作与先进工作者的培养工作，以巩固与扩大竞赛的成果。
