　　Sensitively Listen to the Voices of Ordinary Staff Members
    Shubin, Secretary of the Pskov Oblast Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
    Lenin and Stalin taught us that: the correct selection of personnel and the regular organization of implementation checks are one of the basic principles of Bolshevik leadership. Regarding this matter, as Comrade Stalin instructed, checks from above and checks from below must be combined.

    “Some comrades believe that checks can only come from above, that is, leaders checking the work results of those they lead. This is incorrect. Checks from above are an effective method for checking personnel and the execution of tasks, and are certainly necessary. But checks from above cannot complete the entire check. There is another kind of check, a check from below, that is, the masses, those led, checking the leaders, pointing out their mistakes and showing them the way to correct them. This check is one of the most effective methods for checking personnel."

    In fact, it means that every leader should regularly maintain contact with the masses, should sensitively listen to the voices of the workers, should accept all their criticisms in a Bolshevik manner, and should make the necessary and practical summaries for their daily work. If a Bolshevik leader violates this principle, it will inevitably lead to adverse consequences. This can be clearly seen in the example of the work of the Pskov Oblast Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). For a long period of time, the Party's Oblast Committee did not listen to the voices of the masses and Communist Party members, did not develop criticism and self-criticism, and even attempted to suppress criticism.

    It is no wonder that flattery, adulation, and concealing mistakes spread in the organization. A corrupt family environment was established. All of this ultimately led to serious failures in work, placing the Oblast in a backward position in solving the most important political and economic tasks.

    In order for the Pskov Oblast Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to abandon inappropriate leadership methods and resolutely correct the many shortcomings in its work, the intervention of the Party Central Committee was needed. Comrade Stalin’s instructions on organizing checks from below in all our work were invaluable to us in this matter.

    When the Party’s Oblast Committee and the Oblast Party organization recognized that the masses and their conscious and active participation in labor are the decisive force in all undertakings, they began to pay close attention to the work of the masses and non-Party activists. Secretaries, Standing Committee members, and ministers of the Party’s Oblast Committee, Municipal Committee, and District Committee began to visit enterprises and collective farms more frequently, give political reports to residents, and discuss issues with residents.

    If, in the past, Party organs often replaced Soviet and local organizations, solving economic problems in parallel with them, and putting the work of activists in a secondary position, now our Party leaders have put the organizational work of the Party and the political work of the masses in the primary position.

    The Standing Committee of the Party’s Oblast Committee has recently carefully studied the criticisms and suggestions submitted from below to the Oblast and District organizations, and has adopted many important methods in accordance with their suggestions.

    The suggestions of Communist Party members, ordinary workers, and collective farm members have helped the Oblast Committee to expose important shortcomings in the work of the Petalov District Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The working members of the Petalov District Committee enriched themselves by taking advantage of their working positions and seriously violated Soviet decrees. The Oblast Committee replaced the old, bankrupt leadership and consolidated the organs of the District Committee local organizations with new young cadres, thus accurately demonstrating the improvement in the work among the workers and the development of their initiative and enthusiasm.

    This fact can also illustrate. A letter from Bolkhov was sent to the Oblast Committee exposing the incorrect methods of the Standing Committee of the District Committee. The Oblast Committee conducted an inspection based on this letter, and the result found that the Bolkhov District Committee of the Party and its First Secretary Yermakov had not fulfilled the inherent functions of the Party organs, wasted manpower, and even deprived the District Committee of the possibility of realizing true Party leadership in all economic and political life in the district, consolidating grassroots Party organizations, and improving their combat effectiveness. Therefore, the Bolkhov District Committee of the Party convened a plenary session, which was filled with an atmosphere of sharp criticism and exposed other events of the bad work of the District Committee. The plenary session gave sharp criticism to the egregious facts of the work of the Standing Committee of the District Committee. Those leaders who harmed themselves were removed from their positions.

    Relying on the combination of checks from above and checks from below, we were able to expose the shortcomings in the work of the Gedov District Committee of the Party. It was discovered that the Gedov District Committee was exceptionally keen on empty meetings. The District Committee held five to six Standing Committee meetings every month. In November of last year, the District Committee discussed forty different economic issues. These meetings were usually formal. For example, the Standing Committee discussed the work of forestry economics three times, but the plan for storing forest wood was not completed. The resolutions passed by the Standing Committee of the District Committee were exactly the same. They all had a common, public nature. The Standing Committee of the Oblast Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) resolutely criticized this bad practice.

    The Party’s Oblast Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), shifted the center of all work to Party work issues and improving the combat effectiveness of grassroots Party organizations. Much attention is given to Party education, the ideological and political education of intellectuals, and the development of broad mass political work. All of this will soon be reflected in the smoother completion of economic tasks. Obviously, the fish production industry exceeded the fishing plan for the first time after the war. Some collective farms in the Oblast have more successfully completed the annual agricultural plan and the plan for storing flax than before. The collective farms are preparing for spring sowing better than last year. Areas that have been in a long-term backward state are beginning to make progress. We can take the Ostrov District as an example. This large-scale agricultural area was in serious disrepair. Now, after taking many methods, the situation in this area has begun to improve. In the past, this backward area successfully completed the annual agricultural plan and completed the plan for manufacturing flax fiber for the country. In the collective farms, 105 percent of the plan for breeding various public livestock was completed.

    The examples cited illustrate that improving the work for the masses and attracting activists not only to participate in checks from above, but also to check the work of our organization from below, helps to expose shortcomings, while mobilizing the broad masses of workers to eradicate shortcomings, develop the creative initiative of the masses, and promote the development of criticism and self-criticism. The combination of checks from above and checks from below can help rationally solve the problems that occur in specific environments and find the most direct path to ensure success.

    With the help of activists, we were able to study many methods that can enable the cultivated land area of collective farms to reach the pre-war level in the shortest period of time. We will take into account the specific environment of each area to complete this task. Take the necessary methods to consolidate machine tractor stations, drain water from swampy land, and clear scrub forests. In order to solve this important topic, we have calculated all the possibilities that the Oblast has. The government has given us great help. The machine tractor stations in the Pskov Oblast have received supplementary new tractors and agricultural machines. Some pasture land improvement stations will be organized in the Oblast.

    The Pskov Oblast has every possibility to quickly end backwardness and develop its socialist agriculture along the road of large-scale production of high-quality flax and the widespread development of livestock that supplies meat and milk.

    During the election campaign, the Party organization significantly strengthened mass political work in cities and villages. Now, we are taking various methods to consolidate this achievement that has been obtained.

    Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Party organization in the Pskov Oblast is rebuilding and improving the Party’s political work, developing criticism and self-criticism in its own ranks, and striving to make the Oblast among the advanced Oblasts in the country.

　　敏感地听取普通工作人员的声音
    联共（布）普斯克夫州委会书记  叔宾
    列宁和斯大林教导我们说：正确的选拔人员和经常组织执行的检查，是布尔塞维克领导的基本原则之一。关于这件事情，正如斯大林同志所指示，从上面的检查和从下面的检查必须结合起来。
    “有些同志认为：检查仅能从上面的检查，即领导者检查被领导者的工作结果。这是不正确的。从上面的检查是对人员检查和对任务执行检查的有效方法之一，当然是需要的。但是从上面的检查还不能完成检查的全部。还有另一种检查，从下面的检查，即群众、被领导者们检查领导者，指出他们的错误和指给他们矫正的道路。这种检查是检查人员最有效的方法之一。”
    事实上，它意味着：每个领导者应经常保持着与群众的联系，应敏感地听取劳动者的声音，布尔塞维克式地接受他们一切批评的意见并为自己的日常工作做出必需而切实的总结。布尔塞维克的领导如破坏了这个原则，必将招致不良的后果。这件事在联共（布）普斯克夫州委会的工作例子上可以明确地看出。党的州委会长期间没有听取群众的声音和共产党员的声音，没有展开批评与自我批评，甚至曾企图抑制批评。
    在该组织中传播着谄媚、阿谀和掩饰错误，是无足奇怪的。建立起了腐朽的家庭环境。所有这些终将招致工作中的严重失败，使该州在解决最重要的政治和经济的任务方面处于落后之中。
    为了使联共（布）普斯克夫州委会放弃不适当的领导方式和坚决地纠正自己工作中的许多缺点，党中央委员会的干涉是需要的。斯大林同志关于组织我们全部工作中从下面的检查的指示，在这件事情中对于我们具有无法评价的帮助。
    当党的州委会，州的党组织认识到群众和他们自觉的和积极的参加劳动是全部事业的决定性力量时，它们开始非常注意对群众和对非党积极分子的工作。书记、常委和党的州委会、市委会和区委会的部长们曾开始较频繁地访问企业和集体农场，给居民作政治报告，与居民谈论问题。
    如果从前党机关时常顶替了苏维埃和地方组织，与他们并行地解决经济问题，而把活动分子的工作放到次要地位，那么现在我们党的领导者们把党的组织工作的和群众政治的工作提到了首要地位。
    党的州委会常委会在最近期间内曾细心地研究了从下面提给州和区组织的批评意见和建议，并按照他们的建议采取了许多重要方法。
    共产党员、普通工人和集体农庄庄员的建议，曾帮助州委会揭露了联共（布）佩塔洛夫区委会工作中的重要缺点。佩塔洛夫区委会的工作会员，利用着自己的工作地位而自肥，严重地破害了苏维埃的法令。州委会撤换了旧的、破产的领导，以新的青年干部巩固了区委会地方组织的机关，因之确切地表现出了在劳动者之间工作的改善和他们的倡议性和积极性的发展。
    这个事实也能够说明。从波尔豪夫给州委会寄来一封关于揭露区委会常委会工作的不正确方式的信件。州委会依据这封信作了检查，结果发现党的波尔豪夫区委会和它的一等书记耶尔玛科夫未曾完成党机关的固有职能，浪费了人力，以至剥夺了区委会实现真正的党的领导区内全部经济和政治生活，巩固基层党组织和提高他们战斗力的可能性。因此，党的波尔豪夫区委会召开了全会，这个全会充溢着尖锐批评的气氛，并揭露了区委会一些坏的工作的其他事件。全会对于区委会常设委会工作的恶劣事实给予了尖锐的批评。危害了自己的领导者们被撤了职。
    我们依靠从上面的检查和从下面的检查的结合，能够揭露了党的格道夫区委会工作中的缺点。格道夫区委会异常热衷于空洞的会议的事情被发现了。区委会每月进行五次——六次常委会的会议。在去年十一月里，区委会曾讨论了四十件不同的经济问题。这些会议通常是形式的，例如，常委会曾三次讨论林业经济工作问题，但贮藏林木的计划却没有完成。在区委会常委会上所过通的决议是一模一样的。它们都具有共同的，公告的性质。联共（布）州委会的常委会坚决地批评了这种不良的作风。
    党的州委会依据联共（布）中央委员会的指示把全部工作中心移到党内工作问题和提高基层党组织的战斗性方面来。对于党的教育、知识分子的思想——政治教育和展开广泛的群众政治工作给予很多的注意。所有这些都会很快地反映在更顺利的完成经济任务上。明显地，如战后鱼产工业首次超额完成了捕鱼计划。州内的一些集体农庄较前更是成功地完成了农业一年计划，完成了贮藏亚麻计划。各集体农场比去年更好地准备春季播种。处于长期落后的地区开始进步着。我们可以拿奥斯特洛夫区作例子。这个大规模的农业区曾处于严重的破碎中。现在，采取许多方法后，这个区域的情况已开始好转。昔日这一落后地区成功地完成了农业一年计划，为国家完成了制造亚麻纤维计划。在集体农庄中，完成了繁殖各种公共牲畜的计划的百分之一百○五。
    所举的这些例子说明了：改善对群众的工作和吸引积极分子不仅参加从上面检查，而且还要从下面检查我们组织的工作，帮助揭发缺点，同时动员广大的劳动群众铲除缺点，发展群众的创造性倡议，促进展开批评与自我批评。从上面的检查和从下面的检查的结合，能帮助合理解决具体环境中所发生的问题，找到保证获得成功的最简捷的道路。
    我们借助积极分子的帮助，能够研究出很多方法，而这些方法在最短期间内能使集体农庄的耕地面积达到战前的水平。我们将要考虑到每个区的具体环境，来完成这个任务。采取必要的方法来巩固机器拖拉机站，排除沼泽地的水，扫除灌木林。我们为了解决这个重要的课题，计算了州内具有的一切可能性。政府给予我们很大的帮助。普斯克夫州的机器拖拉机站接到了补充的新拖拉机和农业机器。在州内将组织起来一些牧草土地改良站。
    普斯克夫州具有一切可能性来迅速地结束落后，沿着大规模生产高等品质的亚麻和广泛的发展供给肉、乳的牲畜的道路，来发展自己的社会主义农业。
    党组织在选举运动期间，显著地加强了城市与乡村中的群众政治工作。现在，我们采取各种方法，来巩固这已获得了的成就。
    普斯克夫州的党组织在联共（布）中央委员会领导下，重建和改善党的政治工作，在自己的行列中展开批评与自我批评，力使本州迈入国内先进各州之中。
