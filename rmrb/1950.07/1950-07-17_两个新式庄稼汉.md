　　Two New-Style Peasants
　　　　One, Yu Xichao Treats Aphids
　　Yu Xichao is a new-style peasant from Yujiatun, Chengxiang District, Nangong County. He is thirty-six years old this year and has a considerable level of elementary school education. His family has eight members and cultivates twenty-one mu of land. He not only actively works but also likes to read newspapers, learn new production knowledge and technology, and create new ways of farming. He learned about the government's production policies from the newspaper and decided to plant more cotton this spring. He also saw in the newspaper the achievements of cotton-growing experts like Meng Xinghua from Dongzhangjia Village and greatly admired them. He was determined to learn from the cotton-growing experts in Dongzhangjia Village. After a few days, the newspaper published the methods and experiences of cotton growing in Dongzhangjia Village. He repeatedly studied these experiences. Yu Xichao's family is a new-style democratic family, and all family members, male and female, go to the fields for production. He led the family in discussing these cotton-growing experiences and fully understood the methods of cotton growing in Dongzhangjia Village. In February this year, he personally visited Dongzhangjia Village, humbly asked cotton-growing expert Meng Xinghua for advice, and became even more convinced of Meng Xinghua's yield of three hundred jin per mu and his cotton-growing methods. He planted twelve mu of cotton on his twenty-one mu of land this year, applying an especially large amount of base fertilizer and planting all in large ridges. Before the wheat harvest, he hoed the cotton fields three times and plowed them once. While hoeing, he taught the whole family the method of thinning seedlings, with a spacing of more than one and a half feet between plants.
　　Just after the wheat harvest, aphids broke out in the cotton fields, and they were very serious. Yu Xichao was anxious and immediately mobilized the whole family to go to the fields to eliminate them. At first, his daughter Fengzhu wanted to weave another piece of cloth, and his son said that school was important. He said to his son, "If aphids ruin the cotton, we will starve, how can you go to school?!" He also specifically calculated with his daughter Fengzhu: if aphids are treated, one mu of land will yield ten more jin of cotton, how much foreign cloth can we buy after the autumn harvest?! After convincing everyone in the family, they immediately started treating the aphids according to the methods introduced in the newspaper.
　　The first time, they used one jin of tobacco leaves, boiled in thirty jin of water, and treated half a mu, but only half of the aphids died. The second time, he added ten or so peppers, one tael of cotton oil, and a piece of soap. This time, the medicinal power was stronger, and all the aphids that were touched died, but those that were not touched were still alive. He studied further and first stripped off the soil leaves and useless branches at the bottom of the stem before applying the solution, and indeed all the cotton aphids died. In this way, he changed his method, and he and Fengzhu first stripped the cotton "trouser legs," and several children followed behind, dipping each plant and leaf. In this way, the whole family treated more than two mu a day. Those that were treated sprouted new tips and new leaves after two or three days, and the cotton regained its health. He became even more motivated to treat the aphids and treated all twelve mu once. Unexpectedly, after a few days, new aphids appeared on the cotton tips, and the cotton plants showed a morbid state again. The masses ridiculed him, saying, "You have the leisure to treat them, and they have the leisure to be born." But he was not discouraged, and he mobilized the whole family to start the second treatment. This time, he found that new aphids grew on cotton plants that ants had climbed on, but not on those that hadn't. He studied how to prevent ants from climbing. After much thought, he suddenly remembered that mothballs could kill ants. He crushed the mothballs into a fine powder and mixed them into the tobacco leaf water. Sure enough, the ants stopped climbing onto the cotton plants, and no new aphids grew on the tips. Within three days, he treated all twelve mu of cotton again. His cotton quickly grew and developed, with new tips sprouting new leaves, and new leaves growing new branches, and flower buds emerging on the new branches. People in the village went to see and learn from him, and the aphid treatment movement unfolded. Yu Jinshan, Yu Mengshi, and other households had already started treating aphids under his influence. The masses praised him, saying, "Xichao is really capable, we must learn from him!"
　　He said to people in the village, "We must compare our harvest with the cotton-growing experts in Dongzhangjia Village in the autumn."
　　From this year's aphid treatment work, he gained a basic experience. He said: "This year's treatment was late, so it took so much effort; next year, before planting cotton, we must prepare tobacco leaves, mothballs, and other medicines, and as soon as the cotton seedlings emerge, we will spray them with a sprayer first." He said, "Prevention is better than cure." Now, he is closely monitoring whether cotton aphids will continue to grow, while stepping up intertillage and applying additional fertilizer.
　　　　Two, Cui Bingxin and His Si-Character Cotton
　　Since Cui Bingxin won the title of labor model last year, especially after participating in the economic conference in the province this spring, he kept in mind Chairman Yang's call to plant more cotton. He knew the principle of "the mother is big, the child is fat," and "good seeds yield strong seedlings and a large harvest." Before planting cotton, he contacted Renqiu Farm and found good Si-character No. 2 cotton seeds. On April 22nd (the second day of Guyu), he and his son, Shu, planted two mu and two fen of cotton. Fearing that the seedlings would not emerge well, he kept running to the fields to check. After four or five days, he dug up the soil and saw that the seeds had germinated and were drilling upwards, and then he was relieved. The tender cotton seedlings emerged completely in ten days. Not a single one failed to emerge. Bingxin kept praising the farm's good seeds in his heart. Although the seedlings grew quickly, he always felt that they were growing slowly. When the cotton grew to two leaves and one heart, he began to hoe the first time. When the cotton grew to a cross (four leaves), he began to thin the seedlings, leaving three plants in each mound for the first thinning. While thinning the seedlings, he found cotton aphids. He came up with a way to catch and kill aphids: every morning before the sun came out, he went to the fields, and while the cotton leaves had dew, he sprinkled dry soil on the cotton plants. Due to the adhesion of the soil, the reproduction of aphids was indeed reduced. Later, he discovered that wherever there were cotton aphids, there were ant nests nearby. Wherever there were cotton aphids, ants would crawl up the plants. He therefore guessed that ants were related to the reproduction of cotton aphids. He immediately tried to eliminate the ants. He spent two days using water to irrigate the ant nests in the fields. After a few days of treatment, most of the cotton aphids were captured and killed. Some cotton plants had already grown new leaves. Seeing that the ground was compacted from trampling while killing the aphids, he quickly hoed the second time. Ten days after the first thinning, when the cotton plants grew to four or five branches, he thinned the seedlings for the second time. This time, he left two plants in each mound. Entering the Xiaoman season, when the cotton plants grew to six or seven inches tall, he began to thin to single plants. After thinning the seedlings, he always went to the fields once a day, fearing that more aphids would grow and ruin everything. He saw that a few cotton plants still had aphids, so he continued to catch and kill them using the previous method. Now, his cotton has been hoed four times. The plants have grown to one foot tall, with five or six branches with long cotton bolls appearing, and they will soon bloom. The leaves are tender and green, especially in the morning, when the sunlight shines on the dew on the cotton leaves, reflecting light, making the cotton leaves look particularly lovely and green. At this time, Cui Bingxin dispelled his worries about aphids and smiled happily. He said happily, "My cotton is the best in Gao Lizhuang."
　　Now he has started pruning and shaping the cotton plants. When pruning, he first carefully strips off the miscellaneous leaves at the lower end of the cotton plants, and then removes the crazy branches below the branches that bear cotton bolls. He starts in the morning after the dew dries and stops around eleven o'clock in the morning. He starts again at five o'clock in the afternoon until sunset. He prunes the cotton at these times so that he does not damage the branch bark. He not only cares about pruning his own cotton but also often tells others about pruning techniques. He said, "I want to ensure that all the cotton in the village grows well."

　　两个新式庄稼汉
        一、于熙超治蚜虫
    于熙超是南宫县城厢区于家屯的一个新式庄稼汉。今年三十六岁，具有相当高小程度的文化水平。全家八口人，种二十一亩地。他不但积极劳动，而且还喜欢看报，学习新的生产知识和技术；创造新的种庄稼办法。他从报上了解了政府的生产政策，决定今年春天要多种棉花。在报上他又看到东张家庄种棉能手孟兴华等种棉花的成绩，非常羡慕。他就决心要向东张家庄的种棉能手们学习。待了几天，报上又登出了东张家庄种棉的方法和经验。他反复的研究了这些经验。于熙超的家庭是一个新式民主家庭，全家男男女女都会下地生产。他领导全家讨论了这些种棉经验，完全领会了东张家庄种棉的法子。今年二月里，他亲到东张家庄拜访，虚心的向种棉能手孟兴华请教，对孟兴华每亩收三百斤的产量和种棉的方法更确信无疑了。他二十一亩地今年种了十二亩棉，底粪上得特别多，一律种的大垅。在麦收前，他就把棉花锄了三遍，并用犁耕了一次。在锄地当中，他教会了全家人定苗的方法，棵间距离都是一尺半以上。
    刚收了麦，棉花地里又闹起蚜虫来了，而且非常严重。于熙超着忙了，立即动员全家下地除治。起初女儿凤柱想再织匹布，儿子也说上学要紧。他对儿子说：“蚜虫把棉花闹坏了，我们就得挨饿，那里还能上学？！”他又和女儿凤柱具体算账：治了蚜虫，一亩地多收十斤棉花，秋后得买多少洋布？！把全家里的人思想打通了，立即按报上介绍的办法开始治蚜。
    第一次用烟叶一斤，熬水三十斤，治了半亩，但蚜虫只死了一半。第二次他加上了十来个辣椒，和一两棉油，一块肥皂。这回药力大了，凡蘸着的蚜虫都死了，但没蘸着的仍然活着。他又研究先把根底下的土叶荒枝捋去再蘸，棉蚜果然都死了。这样他就改变方式，他和凤柱先捋棉裤腿，几个孩子在后边跟着挨棵挨叶蘸，这样一天全家治二亩多。凡治了的，二、三天就生出新尖新叶，棉花恢复了健康。他治着更带劲了，一连把十二亩都治了一遍。不料待了几天，棉尖上又生了新蚜虫，棉棵又呈现了病态。群众们都向他讥笑地说：“你有闲工夫治，它就有闲工夫生。”但他仍不灰心，他又动员全家开始治第二遍。这回他发现凡蚂蚁爬过的棉株就生新蚜虫，没爬的就没有。他就研究不叫蚂蚁爬的法子。经过苦思研究，他猛然想起卫生丸能治蚂蚁，把卫生丸压成细末渗在烟叶水里，果然蚂蚁就不往棉棵上爬了，棉尖也不再生蚜虫了。在三天时间内，他就又把十二亩棉花普治了一遍。他的棉花很快的发育生长起来了，新尖生新叶，新叶长新枝，新枝上吐出了花蕊。村里人们这个去看，那个去学，治蚜运动就展开了。于金山、于孟氏等户，在他影响下早就动手治了。群众们都夸奖他说：“人家熙超算真能，就得跟他学！”
    他在村里对人说：“秋后一定得和东张家庄的种棉能手们比比收成。”
    他从今年的治蚜工作中，得到了一个基本经验。他说：今年治的晚了，所以费了这么大劲；明年种棉前，就要把烟叶卫生丸等药品准备好，棉花出捉了苗，就用喷雾器先挨着喷一遍。他说：“治病不如预防好。”现在，他一面严密地注意棉蚜是否还会生长，一面加紧中耕和增肥补粪。
            二、崔炳信和他的斯字棉
    崔炳信自去年荣膺劳动模范的称号以后，特别是在今年春到省参加经济会议以后，他把杨主席号召多种棉的事，牢牢记在心里。他知道“母大子肥”、“种好秧强收的多”的道理。在种棉前，他就到任邱农场接洽，找到了好的斯字二号棉种籽。到四月二十二日那一天（谷雨节的第二天）和他儿子——树，把二亩二分棉花种好。惟恐苗儿出不好，他不断的跑到地里去看。四、五天后，他刨开土看见种籽发了芽，正往上钻，这才放了心。鲜嫩的棉花苗在十天头上出齐了。没有一棵不出的。炳信心里不停的赞扬农场的好种籽。虽然苗儿长的很快，他总是嫌他长的慢。棉花长到两叶一个心，就开始锄了头遍。棉花长到十字架时（四个叶时）就开始定苗，第一次定苗每堆留三棵。在定苗时，发现生了棉蚜。他想出捕灭蚜虫的办法：每天早晨太阳还没有出来，他就到了地里，趁着棉叶上有露水，把地里的干土撒在棉花棵上，由于土的粘合，果然减少了蚜虫的繁殖。后来他又发现了凡是有蚜虫的棉棵，附近就有蚂蚁窝。有蚜虫的棉棵，就有蚂蚁往上乱爬。他因此猜到蚂蚁与棉蚜的繁殖有关。他立刻设法消灭蚂蚁。费了两天时间他用水在地里灌蚂蚁窝。经过几天除治，棉蚜大部分被捕杀了。有的棉棵已长出新叶。看见地里因捕杀棉蚜被踏的实了，赶忙锄了二遍。在头次定苗后十天，棉棵长到四、五个杈，就定了第二次苗。这次定苗每堆留两棵。进入小满节，棉棵长到六、七寸高，就开始定单苗。定苗以后，他每天总到地里看一趟，生怕再生了蚜虫就坏了事。他见到少数棉棵还有蚜虫，便用以前的方法不断的去捕杀。到现在，他的棉花已锄了四遍。棵长到一尺高，出现了五、六个长棉桃的枝叶，很快就要开花。叶子长得又嫩又绿，特别是在早晨，太阳光映射在棉叶的露珠上，反射出光彩来，更显得棉叶碧绿得可爱。这时，崔炳信揭去了怕生蚜虫的顾虑，喜笑颜开。他高兴地说：“高李庄再没有我这棉花再好了。”
    现在他开始了打杈修整棉花。修整时，先小心的捋净棉棵下端的杂叶，然后去掉生棉桃枝以下的疯枝杈。他每天在早晨露水干了就动手，大约到上午十一点钟就停止。下午五点钟动手到日落。他在这种时候修整棉花，损坏不了枝皮。他不但这样关心的去修整自己的棉花，还经常把修整技术告诉给别人。他说：“我要保证全村的棉花都长好。”
