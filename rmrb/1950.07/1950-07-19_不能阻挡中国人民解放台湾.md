Cannot Stop the Chinese People from Liberating Taiwan
    National Advanced Vocational School, Chen Zhenhua
    As I read the article "General Kim Il-sung's Broadcast to the Entire Korean Army and People," I couldn't help but burst into tears of extreme anger several times. It was as if I personally heard General Kim Il-sung, on the coast of the Far East, sounding a magnificent bugle. This bugle not only called upon the entire Korean army and people to unite as one and victoriously complete the just liberation war of the Korean people, but also encouraged the oppressed nations of the East to bravely rise up and fight for their freedom. This great bugle resounded in the hearts of every peace-loving person in the world!

    "...Use your weapons to aim at the enemy, and remember that you are performing a sacred task before your own motherland and people." What an inspiring order!

    American imperialist bandits! Taiwan is forever the territory of our Chinese people! The brave and powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army is also performing a sacred task before its own motherland and people. Nothing can stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan!

    If the American imperialists dare to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, further disrupt peace, and launch a bandit war on our motherland's territory, I will give up everything I have and dedicate myself without hesitation to the great war to defend the motherland!

　　不能阻挡中国人民解放台湾
    国立高工  陈振华
    当我在阅读《金日成将军向全朝鲜军民广播》一文时，不由自主的曾数度激出了愤极的怒泪。我好像亲耳听见金日成将军，在远东的海滨上，发出雄伟的号角。这号角不但号召了全朝鲜军民，一致团结起来，胜利地完成朝鲜人民的正义的解放战争。同时也鼓舞了东方被压迫民族勇敢的起来为争得自由而战。这伟大的号角，响彻全世界每一个爱好和平人民的心底！
    “……要利用自己的武器瞄准敌人，要牢记你们是在自己祖国与人民的面前执行神圣的任务。”这是多么激人心肺的命令呵！
    美帝国主义强盗家伙！台湾是永属我们中国人民的疆土！英勇强大的中国人民解放军同样是在自己祖国与人民的面前执行神圣的任务。任何东西不能阻挡中国人民解放台湾！
    倘若美帝国主义者胆敢阻挠我国解放台湾，进一步破坏和平，在我祖国的疆土上发起了强盗战争，我将舍去自己的一切，毫不犹豫地献身于保卫祖国的伟大战争！
