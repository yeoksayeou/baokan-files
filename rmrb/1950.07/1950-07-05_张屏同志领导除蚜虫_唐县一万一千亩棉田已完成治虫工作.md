　　Comrade Zhang Ping Leads Aphid Elimination
    Tang County Completes Pest Control Work on 11,000 Mu of Cotton Fields
    Comrade Zhang Ping is a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of the Tang County People's Government in Hebei Province. Recently, he led the farmers in Dongyan Village, Sixth District, in eliminating aphids and achieved great results. The masses in the village once reflected: "The seedlings are small, and using ash water to control insects may not be effective. Can large-leaf tobacco really kill aphids? There are so many insects that we can't possibly control them all." Comrade Zhang Ping used his own savings to buy tobacco leaves, personally learned how to prepare the medicine, and looked for experience. After four preparations and experiments, he succeeded (using one jin of tobacco leaves, one jin of lime, half a jin of white flour, and eighty jin of water). He personally helped the masses to control the pests and promoted it everywhere. Every night, he also convened meetings of township cadres and village cadres to review the day's work, understand the masses' thoughts and the cadres' production situation, so as to determine the work for the next day. As a result, he closely contacted the masses. Military dependent Liu Laoquan used this method to kill the aphids on his four mu of land. He said: "Comrade Zhang's method is really effective!" The masses in nearby Yueling, Xiyan, and other villages saw that aphid control in Dongyan Village was effective, and they also asked to be taught the method. Comrade Zhang Ping educated the masses with his own experience and strengthened the masses' confidence in aphid control. The district planted a total of 30,300 mu of cotton, and under his leadership, aphid control work has been carried out on more than 11,000 mu of land.

　　张屏同志领导除蚜虫
    唐县一万一千亩棉田已完成治虫工作
    张屏同志是河北唐县人民政府民政科科员。最近他在六区东沿村领导农民治蚜虫，获得了很大的成绩。该村群众曾反映：“苗儿小，用烟灰水治虫怕没有效。大叶烟还能治死蚜虫？这么多的虫子治也治不过来。”张屏同志便用自己节余的钱，买上烟叶，亲自动手学配药，找经验。经过四次配制，试验成功（用一斤烟叶、一斤石灰、半斤白面、八十斤水配成）。他就亲自帮助群众除治，并到处宣传。每天晚上又召集下乡干部和村干部开会检讨一天的工作，了解群众的思想及干部生产情况，以便决定第二天的工作。因之就密切了与群众的联系。军属刘老全依此法治死了他那四亩地上的蚜虫。他说：“张同志这办法真顶事！”附近岳令、西沿等村群众看见东沿村治虫有效验，也纷纷要求教给他们。张屏同志以自己的经验教育了群众，坚定了群众治蚜虫的信心。该区共植棉三万零三百余亩，在他的带动下已在一万一千余亩的土地上进行了除治蚜虫的工作。
