　　Funing County Government Accepts Newspaper Criticism
    Actively Organizes the Masses to Catch Pine Caterpillars
    Editor:
    The "People's Garden" on June 20 published a report on the pine caterpillar infestation in the sixth district of our county, and put forward criticisms and suggestions that our county did not pay enough attention to organizing the masses to catch them. In addition to immediately accepting the opinions and vigorously organizing the masses to catch them, the county leadership also conducted a profound self-criticism, believing that the main reason was that there was a bureaucratic style of leadership, and that the work of lower-level cadres was not promptly supervised and inspected, thus making the cadres indifferent to catching pine caterpillars. After the newspaper published our criticism, we immediately studied and arranged this work on the 22nd, and transferred three cadres to the sixth district to lead the caterpillar catching. Under the leadership and education of the county, the erroneous thinking of the cadres in the district that neglected catching caterpillars has been changed, and they now have a correct understanding of this work. County and district cadres have gone deep into villages and households to mobilize the masses, and started catching caterpillars on June 24, which has also led some villages in the second district to actively catch them. In five days, a total of 1,269 people participated in the catching, and 12,692.5 jin of pine caterpillars were caught, which can protect about 3 million pine trees from insect damage. All villages are still actively catching them.

　　抚宁县府接受报纸批评
    积极组织群众捕打松毛虫编辑同志：
    六月二十日“人民园地”刊载关于我县六区发生松毛虫的情况，并提出本县对组织群众捕打工作不重视的批评建议。我们除立即接受意见大力组织群众捕打外，县领导上并作了深刻检讨，认为主要是领导上存在着官僚主义作风，对下级干部的工作没有及时督促与检查，因而使干部对捕打松毛虫漠不关心。此次报纸对我们的批评登出后，我们即于二十二日对此一工作进行了研究、布置，抽调三个干部到六区领导捕虫。该区干部在县的领导及教育下，忽视捕虫的错误思想已经转变，对此一工作已经有了正确的认识。县、区干部已深入各村各户发动群众，于六月二十四日开始捕虫，并带动了二区一部分村庄也积极捕打。在五天中，参加捕打的群众共一千二百六十九人，打下松毛虫一万二千六百九十二斤半，约可保护三百多万棵松树免受虫害。现各村仍在积极捕打中。
