The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Ulanhu of the commission. Chairman Li Weihan reported on the guiding principles of the work of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central Government. He said: Due to the victory of the great Chinese revolution, the relationship between nationalities in the country has undergone fundamental changes, and all nationalities are building a big family of friendship and cooperation of all nationalities of New China in accordance with the nationalities policy in the Common Program. However, as a result of the oppressive policies implemented by the reactionary ruling classes of past generations, some estrangement and concerns still remain between the nationalities, which is very natural; it is necessary to carry out in-depth propaganda and education work, pay attention to opposing great-Han chauvinism tendencies, and at the same time prevent narrow nationalism tendencies. He then said: The correct policy for solving domestic nationalities issues is to implement national regional autonomy in accordance with Article 51 of the Common Program. For this reason, it is necessary to vigorously train cadres from minority nationalities. The State Council has decided to establish nationalities institutes in the Central Government and the Northwest and Southwest administrative regions in order to solve the problem of cadres from minority nationalities. Regarding the issue of internal reform of minority nationalities, Director Li pointed out in particular: It is necessary to follow Chairman Mao's repeated instructions and act according to the level of awareness of the majority of people of all minority nationalities. If the majority of people of a minority nationality do not agree, no reform can be carried out. The freedom of religious belief of minority nationalities must also be seriously respected in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. Regarding helping the economic and cultural development of all minority nationalities, he said: The Central Government attaches great importance to this. The Central People's Government will properly handle the proposals related to this aspect put forward by the minority nationality committee members and specially invited persons at this National Committee Meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, according to their urgency. Finally, Director Li gave a brief report on the work of the commission, and in particular solicited everyone's opinions on issues such as organizing a visiting group to the Southwest and Northwest to visit minority nationality compatriots and publishing publications on nationality work. Chen Quzhen, Burhan, Xirao Gyatso, Qu Wu, Ma Hongbin, Guo Nanfu, Wu Hongbin, Zhu Dehai, Liang Juwu, Wang Weizhou, Ma Jian, Ulanhu, Liu Ge and others then spoke one after another. In their speeches, everyone unanimously expressed their support for the nationalities policy of the Central People's Government and put forward many opinions on carrying out nationalities work. The meeting started at 10:00 a.m. and did not end until 5:00 p.m., with a lunch break in between. The commission will study and handle the many suggestions made by everyone separately.

　　民族事务委员会举行会议
    李维汉报告工作方针
    大量培养少数民族工作干部
    根据各族大多数人民的觉悟程度办事
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府民族事务委员会于六月二十六日举行会议，出席者除在京委员外，有出席此次人民政协全国委员会会议的乌兰夫、赛福鼎副主任委员，张冲、吴鸿宾、奎璧、朱德海等委员及鲍尔汉、喜饶嘉措、马鸿宾、梁聚五、温少鹤、马平甫、安尼瓦尔、依卜拉引、赵诚、吐鲁逊、桑登、郭南甫、彭德怀、张治中、王维舟、傅作义、邓宝珊、赵寿山、屈武、余心清、陈渠珍、卢汉、夏康农、费孝通、吉雅泰、朋斯克等人（依签到次序），并有该会干部二十余人列席。会议由该会乌兰夫副主委主席，李维汉主委报告中央民族事务委员会工作方针，他说：由于中国大革命的胜利，国内的民族关系已经起了根本变化，各民族正在依照共同纲领中的民族政策，建设着新中国各民族友爱合作的大家庭。但由于历代反动统治阶级实行压迫政策的结果，各民族间仍残存着一些隔阂和顾虑，这是很自然的；必须进行深入的宣传教育工作，注意反对大民族主义倾向，同时也要防止狭隘民族主义倾向。接着他说：解决国内民族问题的正确方针是按照共同纲领第五十一条的规定，实行民族的区域自治。为此必须大量地培养少数民族干部，政务院已决定在中央及西北、西南两大行政区设立民族学院，即是为了解决少数民族的干部问题。对于少数民族内部的改革问题，李主任委员特别指出：必须遵照毛主席屡次指示，要根据各少数民族大多数人民的觉悟程度办事，若是少数民族的大多数人民不同意，任何改革都不能进行。少数民族的信教自由，也必须按照共同纲领的规定认真地加以尊重。对于帮助各少数民族经济、文化的发展，他说：中央对此甚为重视，此次政协全国委员会上，各少数民族委员及特邀人士所提出的有关这一方面的提案，中央人民政府将分别缓急予以适当的处理。最后李主委扼要地报告了该会的工作，并特别就组织访问团去西南及西北慰问少数民族同胞及办民族工作刊物等问题征求了大家的意见。继有陈渠珍、鲍尔汉、喜饶嘉措、屈武、马鸿宾、郭南甫、吴鸿宾、朱德海、梁聚五、王维舟、马坚、乌兰夫、刘格平等相继发言，大家在发言中一致表示对中央人民政府民族政策的拥护并提出很多关于开展民族工作的意见。会议由上午十时开始，至下午五时始散，午间曾举行会餐。对于大家所提的许多建议，将由该会分别研究处理。
