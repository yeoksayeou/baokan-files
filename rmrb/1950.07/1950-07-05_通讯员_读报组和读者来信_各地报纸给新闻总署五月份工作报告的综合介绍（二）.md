　　Correspondents, Reading Groups, and Readers' Letters
    Comprehensive Introduction to the News Agency's Work Report for May by Local Newspapers (Part Two)
    News Agency Research Office

　　In the work reports for May submitted by local newspapers to the News Agency, many criticisms were made regarding shortcomings in connecting with the masses and the unclear mass perspective in newspaper work.

　　The Pingyuan Daily stated: "Newspapers are for the masses to read and are used to speak to the masses... This viewpoint has long been unclear in our thinking. Because the vast majority of the masses are illiterate, and only cadres can understand the newspaper, we mistakenly confused the readership with the service audience. This is a manifestation of our weak mass concept and the main reason for neglecting to connect with the masses."

　　On the other hand, the Pingyuan Daily also said: "Our newspaper should not only face the peasant masses, but also the working class and other democratic classes. This viewpoint is also not very clear to us... A doctor from the Provincial Health Bureau said to us: 'You only publish things about production and disaster relief. It is estimated that there are 20,000 people in Xinxiang City suffering from dysentery. Is this not related to the lives of the masses and not a requirement of the masses?' Fully satisfying the demands of the workers and peasants, while also taking care of the demands of other democratic classes, is an urgent problem to be solved."

　　The Suiyuan Daily had a similar situation. In their report, they said: "We had a serious deviation. Readers called us the 'Peasant Newspaper'. Basically, it was still a set of rural newspaper practices, only seeing the activities of peasants, and having little or no activities of other classes. After entering Gui Sui, there were a few scattered and fragmented news stories about workers' activities, which did not reflect the significant changes in the working class after liberation. We despised civil servants, intellectuals, and student youth ideologically and did not pay attention to their problems. Regarding the bourgeoisie, after entering the city, we reported some punishments for capitalists who beat and scolded workers or unreasonably dismissed them, but did not reflect their legitimate activities. This made capitalists read our newspaper with the mentality of seeing 'who has been criticized' and 'whether they are in danger'."

　　The masses have criticized this phenomenon. The Shenyang Daily solicited readers' opinions, and four opinions reflected by workers were: "The quality of news has improved, and the guidance has also been strengthened, but it is only for the leaders to see, and there is very little about the masses."

　　These phenomena must be vigorously corrected. The Shanxi Peasant Newspaper stated: "Experience has proven that relying on the correct propaganda policies to connect with the masses gives the connection with the masses a soul; connecting with the actual lives and work of the masses to specifically publicize the policies gives the propaganda of the policies persuasive power and practical effect. We have realized that the peasants' habit of understanding things is: if there is 'reason' but no 'event', they will not accept it; but if there is 'event' but no 'reason', they cannot see through it and cannot improve. In order to enhance the persuasiveness of the articles and strengthen the propaganda effect of the newspaper, there must be examples and opinions. We must neither talk about principles emptily nor simply reflect fragmented facts."

　　One of the ways to correct these shortcomings is to carry out the worker-peasant correspondent movement and establish reading groups to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the masses. In the past, we also valued correspondence work, but as the Xiamen Daily said in reviewing their correspondence work, most of the correspondents were "staff members of various agencies and mass organizations, accounting for 80%, while workers and students accounted for 20%. Most of them are from intellectual backgrounds, and there are very few worker-peasant correspondents." After the News Work Conference, local newspapers have generally attached importance to this issue. The Jinan Peasant Masses Newspaper has gained this understanding: "The quality of correspondence work is one of the decisive links in whether a local newspaper can be run well. We believe that mobilizing cadres and peasant activists to write for the newspaper is an important task to guide the masses to participate in national construction, and we must constantly educate correspondents with this spirit. Do not simply ask correspondents for articles and simply tell them writing methods, but combine mobilizing correspondents to write articles with organizing mass actions. Do not simply regard it as an ancillary work of editing, but regard it as a work of the same importance as editing. The newspaper's editing work must be good at following the mass line, asking questions to the masses, and guiding everyone to discuss."

　　Many newspapers have begun to develop correspondents among the worker-peasant masses. The Northeast Daily analyzed and statistically analyzed seventy-three of the seventy-seven newly developed correspondents. They said, "In terms of education level, four currently have the equivalent of university, four have high school, twenty-seven have junior high school, and thirty-eight have elementary school. In terms of composition, seventy are from worker backgrounds. Three are from student backgrounds (having worked in factories for more than one year). In terms of work positions, forty-one are workers, five are technicians, one is an apprentice, nine are trade union cadres, and fourteen are Party and Youth League committees (trade union cadres and Party and Youth League committees are also recently promoted from workers). In addition, there are three staff members." This statistic proves that the saying that worker-peasant masses have low levels of education and cannot be correspondents is incorrect. Moreover, workers are enthusiastic. The Northeast Daily's report mentioned the reaction of worker correspondents: "'I am very happy to be a correspondent for the Party newspaper. Please help us more. We will definitely write more things.' This is a common reaction. Comrade Yu Xianting, a furnace worker at the No. 27 Electrical Factory, said: 'I am very happy to be a correspondent for the Party newspaper, but I have never written an article before and have a low level of education. This time, I must study hard to write.' (So far, he has written the most articles.) ... Comrade Zhang Shouru from the Railway Factory said: 'There are many problems here, but there were no good correspondents in the past, so we couldn't communicate them. This time, it's great!'" Here, the enthusiasm of workers to be newspaper correspondents is evident on paper, and newspapers should pay attention to these demands.

　　Moreover, those worker-peasant masses with relatively low levels of education can still be organized. The Taiyuan Workers' Newspaper said: "In the past, we did not understand that organizing workers to write letters is one of the best ways for newspapers to connect with the masses. In the future, we must focus on establishing correspondence groups in workshops and studios, and use the method of '×× says ×× writes' to mobilize intellectual correspondents and worker correspondents to help each other write articles. We are not afraid of fragmentation, and we will extensively reflect the creativity, suggestions, questions, demands, and voices of the masses, as well as the writing of workers who are not very literate, etc., to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the masses. Since the correspondents' symposium, we have received and published many letters from workers, letters from readers, and letters from model workers. The general content is very practical, and there are very few empty words.

　　"Facts have proven that doing so is correct, which not only strengthens the newspaper's connection with the vast number of employees but also inspires the workers' sense of responsibility as masters and improves their writing ability... Precisely because the newspaper has initially taken root among the masses, this time, when the All-China Federation of Trade Unions adjusted its organization, although it decided not to have the Taiyuan Workers' Newspaper, at the urgent request of the masses, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions decided to do everything possible to find a way to continue running the newspaper."

　　The Kailuan Miner's Newspaper said: "Since Kailuan Mine launched the Red May Production Conservation and Creation Model Competition on May 15, the newspaper also launched a competition for writing articles and striving for model correspondents, and launched a newspaper reading campaign, laying the foundation for the organizational work of running the newspaper for everyone. Close the connection between the newspaper and the masses and improve the newspaper work. The focus of the correspondent organization is placed underground. Among them, Tangjiazhuang Mine has begun to mobilize. Every day, the mine's correspondence officer receives forty or fifty pieces of short articles from underground workers, such as 'who dug how much coal today,' 'whose shed is effective,' and so on." For newspapers targeting worker masses, many news stories that directly reflect the state of people's production and labor can be extracted from these articles.

　　The Shijiazhuang Daily also stated in their "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work": "The correspondent network, reading groups, and regular contact between leaders and the masses are the organizational guarantee for the newspaper to connect with the masses. The correspondents of each unit are still specifically controlled by the group, and special personnel must be responsible for the overall political leadership and education. It is necessary to restore the correspondent guidance publication and use methods such as ghostwriting, telephone, and correspondence to inspire and help one-seventh of the total number of worker correspondents to write articles."

　　It is very important to obtain the help of leading agencies in the development of correspondents. The experience of the Northeast Daily is: "Through the Party committee, hire correspondents, directly meet with correspondents, understand their political and experience, and understand their lives and thoughts. This method is instructed by the leadership and is very correct. This can truthfully reflect the lives and thoughts of workers when dealing with certain criticisms and praises, and take fewer detours and reduce errors and deviations in the processing of manuscripts." The Henan Daily also noted the assistance of leading agencies in its work. In their report, they said: "In May, while we were studying and discussing the report of the News Work Conference within the agency, we also consulted with the Provincial Party Committee and reported the main spirit of this meeting to the Provincial Party Committee (inviting responsible comrades from various departments to participate) once. At the same time, we also used the industrial and mining conferences and industrial and commercial conferences convened by the government to convey the correspondence work part of the documents of this meeting. These works have been of great help to us in implementing the new improvement guidelines because we have obtained a lot of understanding."

　　Naturally, on the one hand, it is necessary to develop the organization of correspondents, and on the other hand, it is necessary to pay attention to training and education. The Tangshan Labor Daily has gained such experience: "In order to improve the writing ability of worker correspondents one step further, short-term correspondent training courses are held in factories and mines with a focus on the actual situation of production and life in the factory, explaining writing methods, discussing while explaining, and practicing after the explanation, which has a great effect. After the South Factory correspondent training course was completed, everyone had a high enthusiasm and confidence in writing, and the quality of the articles also improved. Therefore, from late March to now, there have been articles by South Factory correspondents in the newspaper every day. In February, the factory's worker correspondents only submitted twelve articles, and most of them could not be adopted. In March, it increased to twenty-three articles, of which 90% could be adopted."

　　Regarding the use of the correspondent force, the Songjiang Daily adopted a contract system for soliciting articles. In their report, they said: "... The contract system for soliciting articles is good and should be promoted, and the following questions are proposed as a reference for continuing to implement the contract system: A. Establish regular contact with the correspondent who is soliciting articles; B. Before soliciting articles, state the reasons for soliciting articles and explain the situation as much as possible for the correspondent's reference; C. Regularly supervise and check, and do not wait; D. After receiving the manuscript, if there are deletions and revisions (except for textual deletions and revisions), the reasons should be explained to the writer as much as possible, and published after obtaining the writer's consent when conditions permit."

　　After a large number of correspondents have been developed, leadership becomes an important issue. The Subei Daily adopted a method of holding regular regional correspondence work conferences. In their report, they said: "Strengthening the correspondent network and establishing reading groups will be the central topic of the third Subei correspondence work conference. Experience has proven that holding correspondence work conferences with certain central content on time has a great effect, which can strengthen the organization of the newspaper and make the editorial reporting plan more practical."

　　Reading groups are still a new task in some newspapers, but it is a very important task, which is to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the masses, and it is a major task in the newspaper's work of organizing the masses. The Shijiazhuang Daily has made such a decision: "Organize reading groups systematically through the Party committee, trade union, and mass organization propaganda departments, and contact them with the newspaper's agency groups, internal and external affairs, collect opinions, and reflect demands. Under the principle of not hindering production, hold regular small-scale discussions with Party, trade union, and Youth League activists, model workers, correspondents, and reading groups in various units to maintain regular contact between the newspaper's leadership and the masses of all classes, with the agency committee members attending, at least once a month per person."

　　In organizing reading groups, combining with the elimination of illiteracy movement is a very important experience. The Lushun-Dalian Farmer's Newspaper said in its report: "Because Lushun-Dalian has basically eliminated illiteracy within two years, and now illiterates are changing in large numbers, we can cultivate many correspondents from here... We are starting to organize extensively through literacy schools and mutual aid groups under the leadership of the Party committee. Before this, we conducted experiments in various places and achieved certain results. For example, there is a mutual aid group with six illiterates. By reading the newspaper, they can not only learn from the experience on the newspaper, or the experience and lessons of other regions, etc., but also combine with literacy. Except for one person in the group, there is no illiterate, and the rest can read and write." In fact, the work of eliminating illiteracy and reading groups has played a mutually promoting role. The Jinan Farmer Masses Newspaper is also doing this. Their report says: "We are preparing to cooperate with the rural elimination of illiteracy movement and vigorously organize newspaper reading work. We are preparing to formulate a regulation, and the Provincial Department of Education has agreed to cooperate with us in organizing and launching."

　　Readers' letters and readers' visits are an extremely important part of the newspaper's mass work, through which the newspaper maintains close contact with the broad masses. After the News Work Conference, local newspapers have given greater importance to readers' letters. Many newspapers use readers' letters as the main content of the supplement. The Jinan Dazhong Daily (which used to have relatively weak reader service work) "changed the original supplement to 'Dazhong Garden', mainly publishing readers' letters, criticisms, self-criticisms, suggestions, and praises for specific examples... When 'Dazhong Garden' was launched, the main contributors were the original correspondents. Because the nature has changed, the number of letters from various places regarding criticism and suggestions has gradually increased." Private newspapers have also achieved significant improvements in this area. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily "Since constantly publishing readers' submissions, starting this month, readers' letters with criticisms sent to this newspaper have increased in proportion. In the past, the proportion of letters was mainly for job search, industrial Q&A, medical Q&A, etc. Readers rarely sent letters criticizing the government, but this month we have started to receive them one after another."

　　Newspapers are welcomed and supported by readers for doing so. The Hebei Daily "changed the supplement to the 'Readers' Letters' edition in the second half of May... which is very popular among readers. A reader named Wang Wenke from Wuyi wrote in a letter: 'I was very excited when I saw the Readers' Letters edition.' He expressed that 'In addition to providing more materials to the newspaper in the future, I will also promote the newspaper among the masses.'" The Anshan Workers' Newspaper also said: "Because the newspaper has carried out criticism and self-criticism and increased social service content, the guidance of the newspaper has been strengthened, and cadres and workers have begun to pay attention to this newspaper... The masses reflect that the newspaper is energetic, people like to read it, we have a place to speak, and the social service column solves the immediate interests of the workers." The Fujian Daily said: "Farmers who are thirty or forty miles away send criticism articles, requesting that they must be published, saying that this is even better than the court solving the problem." In this way, the newspaper's prestige among the masses has been unprecedentedly improved.

　　Many newspapers also publish readers' letters in important positions on the news pages. The New Hunan Daily said in its report: "In addition to regularly publishing readers' letters in 'Mass Life' (a supplement combined from the original supplement and 'Social Service' - quoted by the translator), during this period, we have consciously published some positive suggestions from readers that are of greater significance to the work in the form of readers' letters or work opinions on the news pages, placing the more important ones in a prominent position on the front page. In these seventeen days alone (from May 15th to May 31st), there were 26 readers' letters and work opinions published on the first two pages, of which ten letters were published on the front page. According to current understanding, some readers' active suggestions and criticisms have played a good role in the work. For example, the reader's criticism of the Hunan Native Produce Company's high alum price on May 22nd, and the letter about the lack of sales of Liling porcelain, have attracted the attention of the Native Produce Company and have begun to investigate and correct. The number of letters received and the number of people who come to the group to ask questions or reflect situations has increased significantly, and in the letters, there are more criticisms and suggestions on the work than before." The Hebei Daily also "When dealing with readers' letters, in addition to generally placing them in the Readers' Letters edition, the particularly important ones are also placed in important positions on the news page. Therefore, readers' letters are currently highly valued by leading agencies, cadres at all levels, and the broad masses."

　　The newspaper's emphasis on readers' letters has increased the political enthusiasm of the people and helped the government improve its work. However, the increase in readers' letters requires the newspaper to be able to handle them carefully. The Shijiazhuang Daily stipulated such a working system: "The processing of readers' letters shall not exceed three days, and the letters that are published shall be distributed to various editions according to their content and importance. General letters occupy a relatively fixed position on the supplement edition. For readers' letters that have been urged three times and have not been replied to for more than one month by the agency or individual concerned, it should be brought to the attention of the Party and government inspection agency for punishment."

　　In addition, work on readers' visits has also begun to pay attention to taking the initiative. The Changjiang Daily decided: "In terms of contacting the masses, in addition to using 'Dazhong Garden' as the main tool for contacting the masses and publishing readers' letters, and responding to the masses taking the initiative to come to talk, we are planning to actively invite activists from the masses to talk to the editorial department and hold various forums regularly."

　　However, upon careful inspection, there are still some shortcomings in the newspaper's handling of readers' letters. The Northeast Daily made such a review: "... The Social Service Group has received a lot of letters, but there is a lack of systematic research to understand the current ideological state of the masses, and then the newspaper can systematically answer and educate them. Conducting propaganda and education targeting the current thinking of the masses should be an important program in the future editing plan. In addition, from the 'Excerpts of Readers' Letters', it can be seen that many letters have been handled improperly. Letters that should be seriously investigated and answered are sent to the relevant agencies for reference; letters that do not need to be reviewed are sent to individual agencies for review; and there are some that belong to common sense questions that we cannot answer ourselves... This shows that the editorial department still lacks specific leadership for the Social Service Group, and the comrades of the Social Service Group are not very familiar with the overall situation. In the future, we must try our best to strengthen the work in this area in order to truly implement the policy of strengthening contact with the masses." This kind of inspection and correction is very necessary.

　　Finally, a reflection from the Shenyang Daily is worth noting. They "canceled the second and third editions (study edition and supplement edition) starting from the second half of the month (from the 16th)... But some readers (including teachers, students, agency cadres, and workers) have opinions, saying: 'It's all dry news, it's boring.' This problem needs to be solved well." Of course, using the main space of the newspaper supplement to publish readers' letters is not to turn it into "dry" news, but to enable the newspaper to reflect more vividly on the actual situation. If publishing readers' letters has caused such a result, it should be corrected and resolved.

    各地报纸给新闻总署五月份工作报告的综合介绍（二）
    新闻总署研究室
    在各地报纸给新闻总署的五月份工作报告中，有许多对于联系群众方面的缺点，报纸工作中群众观点不明确的现象作了检讨。
    平原日报说：“报纸是给群众看的，是用来向群众讲话的，……这个观点，我们思想上是长期不明确的。因为现在绝大部分群众是文盲，只有干部才能看懂报纸，我们便错误地把读者对象与服务对象混淆起来。这是我们群众观念薄弱的表现，是忽视联系群众的主要原因。”
    在另一方面，平原日报又说：“我们的报纸不仅要面对农民群众，而且必需面对工人阶级及其他民主阶级的群众。这一个观点，我们也是不十分明确的。……省卫生局一个大夫向我们说：‘你们只是登生产救灾的事情，新乡市据估计现在有两万人患痢疾，莫非这与群众的生活无关，不是群众的要求吗？’充分满足工农的要求，同时照顾其他民主阶级的要求，是迫切要解决的问题了。”
    绥远日报也有同样的情形，他们在报告中说：“我们曾有严重的偏差，读者把我们叫《农民报》。基本上还是农村办报的一套，只见农民的活动，而没有或很少有其他阶级的活动，进入归绥以后，有了少许工人活动的新闻，也是零碎的、片断的，没有反映出解放后工人阶级的重大变化。对公务员、知识分子及学生青年，在思想上是轻视的，不注意他们的问题。对资产阶级，一进城报道了一些对打骂工人及无理解雇的资本家的处分，没有反映他们正当的活动。造成资本家看我们的报纸，抱着看‘斗了谁’，‘自己有没有危险’的心情。”
    群众对这种现象提出了批评，沈阳日报征求读者的意见，有四条工人反映的意见是：“新闻质量提高了，指导性也加强了，但只是给领导看的，有关群众的事很少。”
    这些现象必须大力纠正。山西农民报说：“从经验中证明了：依靠正确宣传政策来联系群众，联系群众才有灵魂；联系群众的实际生活和工作，来具体地宣传政策，宣传政策才有说服力量和实际效果。我们体会到：农民认识事物的习惯是：有‘理’没‘事’，他不接受；但有‘事’没‘理’，他也看不透，提不高。为了使文章的说服力提高，报纸的宣传效果加强，须要有事例，有言论。既不空说道理，也不单纯反映零乱的事实。”
    纠正这些缺点的方法之一，就是开展工农通讯员运动和建立读报组的工作，以加强报纸与人民群众的联系。过去我们也是重视通讯工作的，但是诚如厦门日报在检讨他们的通讯工作时所说的一样，通讯员“以各机关各群众团体工作人员为最多，占百分之八十，工人学生等占百分之二十。大部分是知识分子出身，工农通讯员很少。”新闻工作会议之后，各地报纸已经普遍地重视了这个问题，济南农民大众报取得了这样的认识：“通讯工作的好坏是地方报纸能否办好的决定环节之一。我们认为发动干部与农民积极分子给报纸写稿，是引导群众参加国家建设事业的一项重要工作，要以这种精神经常教育通讯员，不要单纯向通讯员要稿子，和单纯地告诉写作方法，要把发动通讯员写稿子与组织群众行动结合起来。不要把他单纯地看成编辑工作的附属工作，而要把他看成是与编辑工作同样重要的一项工作。报纸的编辑工作要善于走群众路线，向群众发问题，引导大家来讨论。”
    许多报纸已开始在工农群众中发展通讯员，东北日报把新近发展的七十七个通讯员中的七十三个加以分析统计，他们“在文化程度上，目前相当于大学的有四名，高中四名，初中二十七名，高小的三十八名。在成份上工人出身的有七十名。学生出身的（已在工厂工作一年以上）三名。在工作职务上，工人四十一名，技术员五名，学徒一名，工会干部九名，党委团委十四名（工会干部与党团委亦是最近由工人中提拔的），此外有职员三名”。从这个统计可以证明，以为工农群众文化程度低，不能做通讯员的说法是不正确的。而且，工人是热心的，东北日报的报告中说到工人通讯员的反映：“‘我很高兴能做党报的通讯员，请报社的同志多帮助，我们一定多写东西，’这是普遍的反映。电二七厂熔炉工于显廷同志说：‘我很高兴当党报通讯员，但从来没有写过稿子，文化程度很低，这次一定要好好学习写。’（到现在为止，他是写稿最多的。）……铁路工厂张守茹同志说：‘我们这里有很多问题，过去没有好的通讯员，通不出去，这回可好了。’”这里，工人热心做报纸通讯员的情绪跃然纸上，报纸是应该重视他们的这些要求的。
    况且，那些文化程度比较低的工农群众，也还是可以组织起来的。太原工人报说：“以前我们不了解，组织工人来信是报纸联系群众的最好方式之一。今后我们要有重点地建立车间、作坊通讯组，用‘××说××记’的方法动员知识分子通讯员与工人通讯员互助写稿，不怕零碎，大量反映群众的创造、建议、疑问、要求与呼声，以及识字不多的工友的写作等，以加强报纸与群众的联系。自通讯员座谈会后，我们已收到并发表了不少工友来信、读者来信、劳模来信，一般的内容很实际，空话很少。
    “事实证明，这样做是对的，不但能加强报纸对广大职工的联系，而且能启发工人主人翁的责任感，提高他们的写作能力。……正因为报纸初步在群众中生了根，这次全总调整组织时，虽然决定没有太原工人报，但在群众的迫切要求下，市总工会决定竭力从各方面想办法，报纸还要办下去。”
    开滦矿工报说：“开滦矿自五月十五日展开红五月生产节约创模竞赛运动，报社也发动了写稿与争取模范通讯员的竞赛，展开读报运动，为大家办报的组织工作打下了基础。密切报纸与群众联系，改进报纸工作。——通讯员组织的重点放在井下，其中唐家庄矿已开始发动起来，每天该矿通讯干事收到井下工友写的三言两语的稿子，如‘谁今天刨了多少煤，’‘谁棚的棚子得法’等四五十篇。”对于以工人群众为对象的报纸，从这些稿件中是可以提炼出许多直接反映人民生产劳动的状况的新闻来的。
    石家庄日报在他们的“关于改进报纸工作的决定”中也说：“通讯员网、读报组和领导与群众的经常接触，是报纸联系群众的组织保证。各单位的通讯员仍由小组具体掌握，总的政治领导和教育要有专人负责。要恢复通讯员指导刊物，并且要用代笔、电话、通讯等办法启发帮助占全数七分之一的工人通讯员写稿。”
    在发展通讯员中，取得领导机关的帮助是很重要的。东北日报的经验是：“通过党委聘请通讯员，直接和通讯员见面，了解其政治、经历等情况及体会其生活和思想感情。这种办法是领导上指示的，是非常正确的。这可以在处理某些批评与表扬的稿件上，真实地反映工人生活、思想状况，在稿件处理上少走弯路、减少错误与偏差。”河南日报也注意到在工作中取得领导机关的协助，他们在报告中说：“我们在五月份一面自己在机关内学习讨论新闻工作会议的报告，一面商得省委同意，向省委（请各部门负责同志参加）把此次会议主要精神作了一次汇报。同时我们也利用了政府召开的工矿会议工商会议，传达了此次会议文件中的通讯工作部分，这些工作对于我们执行新的改进方针上，因为取得了多方的了解，帮助很大。”
    自然，一方面要发展通讯员的组织，另一方面还是要注意培养和教育。唐山劳动日报取得了这样的经验：“为着把工人通讯员的写稿能力提高一步，有重点地在厂矿中举办短期通讯员学习班，结合该厂生产生活上的实际情形，讲解写稿方法，边讲边讨论，讲完了实习，收效很大。南厂通讯员学习班办完以后，大家写稿热情和信心很高，而且稿件质量也提高了。所以，从三月下旬到现在，报纸上每天都有南厂通讯员的稿件，二月份该厂工人通讯员来稿只有十二篇，而且大部分不能采用，三月份竟增加到二十三篇，其中百分之九十都能采用。”
    关于通讯员力量的使用，松江日报采取了约稿合同制。他们在报告中说：“……约稿的合同制是好的，应加以推动，并提出下面几个问题，作为继续贯彻合同制时的一个参考：Ａ、和约稿的通讯员建立经常联系；Ｂ、在约稿前要提出约稿的理由，并尽可能说明情况，供通讯员参考；Ｃ、经常督促检查，不能等待；Ｄ、来稿后，如有删改（文字上的删改除外），应尽可能向写稿人说明理由，在条件允许时，经取得写稿人同意后再发表。”
    通讯员在大量发展起来之后，领导就成了一个重要问题，苏北日报采取了经常举行全区性通讯工作会议的方式。他们在报告中说：“关于加强通讯员网和建立读报组工作，将作为苏北第三次通讯工作会议的中心议题。经验证明，按时有一定中心内容举行通讯工作会议，作用很大，可以加强报纸的组织性，并使编辑报道计划较为实际。”
    读报组在有些报纸中还是一项新的工作，但这却是一项很重要的工作，是加强报纸与群众的联系，是报纸组织群众工作中主要的一项。石家庄日报已作出了这样的决定：“通过党委、工会及群众团体宣教部门系统地组织读报组，由报社的机关小组内外勤与他们联系，搜集意见及反映要求。在不妨碍生产原则下定期分别召开各单位党、工、团积极分子，劳模、通讯员及读报组的小型座谈，以保持报社领导与各阶层群众的经常接触，社委分工出席，每人每月至少一次。”
    在组织读报组工作中，与消灭文盲运动相结合是一个很重要的经验。旅大农民报在报告中说：“因为旅大在两年内基本消灭文盲的任务下，现在文盲正大批改变，从这里我们可以培养出好多的通讯员。……我们正通过识字学校、互助组，在党委的领导下，开始广泛组织。在这以前，我们曾在各地进行试验，并得到了一定的效果。如有一个互助组，六个文盲，通过读报不但能学习报纸上的经验，或其他地区的经验教训等等，而且还结合识字，全组除一名外，没有一个文盲，其余都能读能写。”实际上，消灭文盲与读报组的工作起了互相推动的作用。济南农民大众报也正在这样进行，他们的报告中说：“我们准备配合农村消灭文盲运动，大力组织读报工作，准备订出一个条例，省教育厅已允与我们配合组织发动。”
    读者来信和读者来访是报纸群众工作中极重要的一部分，报纸从这里与广大的群众保持着密切的接触。新闻工作会议之后，各地报纸都对读者来信予以更大的重视。许多报纸把读者来信作为副刊的主要内容。济南大众日报（这是过去读者服务工作比较薄弱的报纸）“把原来的副刊改为‘大众园地’，主要登载读者来信，批评，检讨，建议和对具体事例的表扬。……在‘大众园地’创刊时，主要的投稿人都是原来的通讯员，因为性质改变了，关于批评与建议性的各地来信已逐渐增多”。私营报纸在这方面也获得了显著的改进。上海文汇报“自从不断发表读者投书后，自本月开始，读者带有批评性的函件寄来本报的，在比例上讲是增多了。过去来信的比例，主要是求职、工业问答、医药问答等，读者对政府批评信件很少很少，本月份开始已陆续收到了”。
    报纸这样做是受到读者的欢迎和支持的。河北日报“五月下半月副刊改为‘读者来信’版……颇受读者欢迎，武邑一个名叫王文科的读者来信说：‘我见到举办读者来信版后，非常兴奋。’表示‘今后除自己多供给报纸材料外，还要在群众中宣传报纸。’”鞍山工人报也说：“由于报纸开展批评和自我批评，增加社会服务内容，报纸的指导性加强了，干部、工人都开始重视了这个报纸。……群众反映，报纸有劲了，报招人爱看了，咱有说话的地方了，社会服务栏给工人解决切身利益了。”福建日报说：“有三四十里路的农民送批评稿件来，要求一定要刊载，说这比法院解决问题还好。”这样，就空前地提高了报纸在群众中的威信。
    许多报纸还以新闻版的重要地位刊载读者来信。新湖南报在报告中说：“除了在‘群众生活’（由原来的副刊和‘社会服务’合成的副刊—引用者）经常刊载读者来信之外，这一时期已开始有意识地把一些读者对工作有较大意义的积极建议，用读者来信或工作意见两种形式刊登在新闻版上，比较重要的放在一版的显著的地位。仅一二版在这十七天（自五月十五日到五月卅一日）当中所刊登的读者来信与工作意见即有二十六件，其中有十件来信，是登在一版上的。据现在了解，有些读者积极的建议与批评已对工作起了良好作用。例如五月二十二日读者对湖南土产公司收矾价钱过高的批评，以及醴陵瓷器没有销路的来信，已引起土产公司的注意，开始调查纠正。群众生活组每天收到的信件和到该组问问题或反映情况的，均显著增加，在来信中特别是对工作的批评与建议也比以前多了。”河北日报也“在处理读者来信时，除一般的放在读者来信版之外，特别重要的还放在要闻版的重要位置，因之，目前读者来信颇受领导机关、各级干部及广大群众的重视”。
    报纸重视了读者来信，就提高了人民群众的政治积极性，而且帮助政府改进了工作。然而读者来信的增多就要求报纸能作周密的处理。石家庄日报规定了这样的工作制度：“读者来信的处理不得超过三日，见报面的依其内容和重要性分发各版，一般来信在副刊版占比较固定的地位。对读者来信经过三次催促，逾期一月不复的机关或个人，应提到党政检查机关请予处分。”
    另外，读者来访的工作也开始注意主动进行。长江日报决定：“在联系群众方面，除以‘大众园地’为联系群众的主要工具，发表读者来信，同时应付群众自动上门谈话之外，正计划主动约请群众中的积极分子到编辑部谈话，定期召开各种座谈会。”
    不过，深入检查起来，报纸对于读者来信的处理还是有一些缺点的。东北日报就作了这样的检讨：“……社会服务组所收到的来信不算少，但缺乏系统的研究，以从中了解群众当前的思想状况，再经过报纸对之系统地解答和进行教育。针对群众当前的思想进行宣传教育，应该是今后编辑计划中的一项重要节目。另外，从‘读者来信摘编’中，看出不少信件处理不当。应认真调查加以解答的，反送给有关机关参考；没有检讨必要的，要个别机关检讨；还有些属于普通常识问题的，自己也不能进行答复……这说明编辑部对社会服务组还缺少具体领导，社会服务组的同志对总的情况也不太熟悉。今后必须尽量加强这方面的工作，才能真正贯彻加强联系群众的方针。”这种检查和纠正是非常必要的。
    最后，沈阳日报的一种反映是值得注意的。他们“自下半月（十六日起）起取消了二版和三版（学习版和副刊版）………但一部分读者（包括教职员、学生、机关干部和工友）有意见，他们说：‘尽是干巴巴的消息，没意思。’这问题需要很好解决。”报纸副刊用主要篇幅来刊登读者来信，当然不是要把他变成“干巴巴”的，而正是要使报纸上能更多地反映活生生的实际，如果刊载读者来信而造成了这样的结果，那是应该加以纠正和解决的。
