Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 10th: The production situation of state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China in June surpassed all previous months in the first half of the year, becoming the best month in the last six months. Of the thirty-six major products in that month, twenty-nine completed and exceeded their targets. In particular, the production of steel and the machine tool industry, which had often failed to meet their plans in the past, completed their tasks ahead of schedule in June. The open-hearth steel ingots produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company exceeded the original plan by 5.1% in June, reversing the situation of failing to complete the task for five months and laying a good foundation for completing the task in the second half of the year. The machine tools produced by the Machinery Administration not only exceeded the planned output by 18%, but also met all quality standards. The seven products that did not complete the task due to focusing on improving quality and other reasons all reached 80% or 90% of the original plan. Although the output of light bulbs from the Electrical Industry Administration only completed 86.3% of the plan, the quality has been improved by one time compared to before.

In addition: The attendance rate of workers in various factories and mines increased significantly in June, averaging over 92%. Hegang Coal Mine, where the attendance rate was only 78% in May, increased to 92.6% in June.

　　东北国营工矿上月生产良好
    三十六种主要产品二十九种超过任务
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北国营工矿业六月份的生产状况超过上半年各个月，成为半年来最好的一个月。该月份三十六种主要产品中，完成并超过任务的共有二十九种。特别是过去经常不能完成计划的钢铁和机械工业的工作母机等生产，六月份均提前完成任务。鞍山钢铁公司所产的平炉钢锭六月份超过原订计划百分之五点一，扭转了五个月未能完成任务的局面，为完成下半年任务打下了良好基础。机械管理局生产的工作母机，不仅产量超过计划百分之十八，质量亦全合标准。由于着重改进质量等原因而未完成任务的七种产品，皆达原计划的百分之八十或九十以上。电器工业管理局的灯泡生产，虽产量仅完成计划百分之八十六点三，但质量已较前提高一倍。
    又讯：六月份各厂矿工人出勤率显著提高，平均达百分之九十二以上。五月份出勤率仅达百分之七十八的鹤岗煤矿，六月份提高到百分之九十二点六。
