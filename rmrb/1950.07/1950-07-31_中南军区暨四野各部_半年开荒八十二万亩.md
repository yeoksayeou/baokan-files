Xinhua News Agency, Hankou Telegram: The Central and Southern Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the various units of the Fourth Field Army have made significant achievements in production and construction in the past six months. According to statistics from early June, in terms of agricultural production: the entire army currently has 955,574 mu of cultivated land (including the 520,000 mu of wasteland reclaimed by a unit of the Fourth Field Army that returned to the Northeast for production in March this year), of which 824,835 mu have been newly reclaimed, and 846,326 mu have been sown. In terms of participating in water conservancy, transportation construction, and transportation, the entire army contributed over 2.1 million workdays and completed over 3.1 million cubic meters of earthwork. During the spring famine, they also assisted in transporting over 31 million jin of public grain in various parts of the Central and Southern region. In terms of sideline production, the entire army burned 1.8 million jin of charcoal, collected over 67 million jin of firewood, raised over 28,000 pigs, over 800 cattle and sheep, over 30,000 chickens and ducks, over 400,000 fish, and possessed a large number of vegetable gardens.

In the Central and Southern regions, the larger projects that various units have assisted local people and units in constructing independently in the past six months include: the Ying River, Shuangbo River, and Qingluo River in Henan; the old dike of the Han River and the Xiao Zhanggong Dike in Hubei; the Liuyang River Dike (Hefengyuan) in Hunan; and the dikes and weirs in the Dong River, West River, and Huiyang, Gaoyao areas of Guangdong. The construction of these water conservancy projects will not only increase a large amount of arable land but also provide considerable protection for the lives and property of the people along the coast.

The vast majority of units have correctly implemented the policy of focusing on labor production, increasing national wealth, and reducing the burden on the people. However, some units have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint and engage in illegal commercial activities. The military region's leading organs have issued a circular to the entire army, strictly prohibiting the military from engaging in commerce. All existing consumer cooperatives at all levels in the army have been closed and transferred to higher-level and government trade departments. The production workshops of various departments are also limited to supplying the needs of the troops themselves. Currently, all departments are conducting in-depth inspections based on the instructions of higher authorities, closing consumer cooperatives at all levels, and focusing their main efforts on labor production.

　　中南军区暨四野各部
    半年开荒八十二万亩
    【本报讯】据新华社汉口电：人民解放军中南军区及第四野战军各部，在半年来的生产建设中已有了显著成绩。据六月初的统计，在农业生产方面：全军现有耕地九十五万五千五百七十四亩（包括今年三月间回东北生产的第四野战军某部开荒五十二万亩在内），其中新开垦的有八十二万四千八百三十五亩，已播种的有八十四万六千三百二十六亩。在参加水利、交通建设及运输方面，全军共出工二百十余万个，完成了三百十余万立方土的工程；春荒期间并在中南区各地协助国家调运公粮三千一百余万斤。副业生产方面，全军烧炭一百八十万斤，打柴六千七百余万斤，养猪二万八千余口、牛羊八百余头、鸡鸭三万余只、鱼四十余万条，并拥有大量的菜园。
    在中南地区的各部队，半年来协助当地人民和部队单独修建的较大的工程计有：河南的颍河、双泊河、青漯河，湖北的汉水旧堤、小张公堤，湖南的浏阳河堤（合丰垸），广东的东江、西江及惠阳、高要一带的堤圩。这些水利工程的修建不但可增加大量可耕的土地，而且使沿岸人民的生命财产有了相当的保障。
    绝大多数的单位在生产中都正确地执行了以劳动生产为主，增加国家财富，减轻人民负担的方针。但也有某些单位存在着单纯的营利观点，发生进行商业活动的违法现象。军区领导机关已通令全军，严禁部队经营商业。全军现有的各级消费合作社已全部结束，并移交上级和政府贸易部门。各部的生产作坊亦只限于供应部队本身的需要。现各部都根据上级指示进行深入检查，结束各级消费合作社，将主要力量投入劳动生产中去。
