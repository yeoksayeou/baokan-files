　　Landlord Counterattacks Emancipated Peasants: Zhang Zihou from the Fifth District of Yi County Writes to Appeal

To the Editor:

　　I am a supply officer in the 19th Army Corps. Due to my age, I was transferred to the supply section chief position at the rear services school of the Army Corps. Now I am the manager of a production cooperative. I joined the army in 1938. I am from Liaoshui Village, Fifth District of Yi County, Hebei Province, and have a family of eight. In 1946, my family was allocated land and a house. In April 1949, I took a month's leave to visit home, and I encountered the landlord Liu Deqing asking the village cadres to return a house that had been allocated to me. The village chief and the village party secretary told him to go to the chairman of the farmers' association. The chairman of the farmers' association, Li Chengxu, wrote a letter of introduction for him to resolve the matter in the district. Later, the district office sent people to summon the landlord Liu Deqing and the chairman of the farmers' association, Li Chengxu. The district assistant asked, "Who confiscated Liu Deqing's house?" The chairman of the farmers' association said, "The village did." The district assistant said, "Whoever confiscated Liu Deqing's house, bring him to me!" The chairman of the farmers' association did not dare to say anything. The landlord Liu Deqing then said, "What is the basis for confiscating my house?" The chairman of the farmers' association told me after returning from the district that Liu Deqing and Assistant Xia were cousins. When District Chief Du was a traffic station instructor in the past, he also lived in Liu Deqing's house, and they had a very good personal relationship. He told me to give the house back to Liu Deqing. On May 14th, District Chief Du came again with an order saying, "Let Zhang Wenyi (my eldest son) move out immediately, no matter if he finds a house to rent or not, and let Liu Deqing move into the house." So I found the village cadres. The village cadres wrote a detailed account of my situation and Liu Deqing's situation to the county government. Five or six days later, Minister Pan of the county armed forces department came to our village to inspect the work and decided to let me continue living in the original house. When the land certificates are issued later, the county government will make a final decision.

　　Last November, a letter from home said that the landlord Liu Deqing and the district cadres were again asking us to move out of the house. So I reported the actual situation to the organization. The organization wrote a letter to the Yi County government last December, hoping that the government would investigate and handle the matter in detail and reply with the results of the handling. But no reply has been received. I sent two letters to the county government, but they did not reply either. According to someone from home who came to visit in February of this year, the county pushed the matter to the district, and the district pushed it to the county. Finally, the district decided to return the house to the landlord Liu Deqing. At the same time, they allowed my family to move out after finding a house. But where can my family find a house? In April of this year, Liu Deqing forced my family to move out of the house. Because my family couldn't find a house to live in, we couldn't move. Liu Deqing took the straw mats used to cover the roof of my house and took them to his house. My family raised objections to the village cadres, but the village cadres did not dare to interfere. There has been a lot of rain this year, and every time it rains, the rain inside the house is as heavy as the rain outside. Every time it rains, the whole family cries together. Not only that, but the landlord Liu Deqing also planted crops in my yard. Because Liu Deqing doesn't live in this house even after he takes it back, he has a house to live in. I believe that the Yi County and district governments should be held responsible for the lawless behavior of the landlord Liu Deqing. Please, Editor, help resolve this.

　　Editor's note: If the situation described in the letter is true, then the counterattack of the landlord Liu Deqing against the emancipated peasants should be severely stopped. The Yi County Fifth District cadres' sheltering of the landlord and their unreasonable decision to recover the house allocated to the peasants should be punished. Please Yi County Government be responsible for investigating the truth and promptly handle it. And publish the results in the newspaper.

　　地主向翻身农民反攻  易县五区张子厚来信申诉编辑同志：
    我是十九兵团一个供给人员。因为年纪关系，调到兵团后方职校任供给股长。现又到生产合作社任经理。我是一九三八年参军的。我是河北省易县五区潦水村人，家里人八口。一九四六年，我家分到土地，分到房子。一九四九年四月间，我请了一个月假回家看望，正遇到地主刘德庆向村干部要回分给了我的一所房子。村长和村支书叫他去找农会主任。农会主任李承绪即写介绍信介绍他到区里解决。后来区公所派人把地主刘德庆和农会主任李承绪传去。区助理员问：“谁没收了刘德庆的房子？”农会主任说：“村里”。区助理员说：“谁没收了刘德庆的房子，把谁给我叫来！”农会主任不敢作声了。地主刘德庆接着就说：“没收我的房子，有什么凭据？”农会主任由区里回来告诉我：刘德庆和夏助理员是表亲。杜区长过去当交通站指导员时又在他家住过，私人关系很好。叫我把房子给刘德庆。五月十四日杜区长又来了命令说：“让张文义（我的长子）马上搬走，不管他找房赁房，叫刘德庆搬进房子去。”于是我就找到村干部。村干部将我和刘德庆的详细情况写给县政府。过了五、六天，县武装部潘部长来我村检查工作，决定让我在原来的房子里住下去。以后发土地证时，再由县政府作最后处理。
    去年十一月家里来信说：地主刘德庆和区干部又叫搬房子。于是我将实际情况报告组织。组织上于去年十二月给易县县政府写了一封信，望政府详细调查处理，并答复处理结果。可是一直未见答复。我给县政府去信两封，他们亦不作复。据今年二月间家里来人谈：这事县里推到区里，区里推到县里。最后区里决定把房子退回给地主刘德庆。同时容许我家里找着了房子再搬走。但是我家里到那里去找房子呢？今年四月间刘德庆就逼迫我家搬房子。因为我家里找不着房子住，没法搬。刘德庆就把我家房顶上盖房顶用的草帘卷下来，拿到了他家里去。我家人向村干部提出意见，村干部又不敢管。今年雨水下得又多，每当下雨，房内和外边下的雨一般大。每下雨一次，全家人就抱头大哭一场。不但这样，地主刘德庆还在我家院子里种上庄稼。因为这房子刘德庆要回去他也不住，他有房住。我认为地主刘德庆这种无法无天的行为，易县县、区政府是应该负责的。请编辑同志帮助解决。

    编者按：信上所说情况，如果确实，则地主刘德庆向翻身农民的反攻行为应受到严厉的制止。易县五区干部包庇地主，无理决定收回分给了农民的房屋，应受到处分。请易县政府负责调查真象，迅速进行处理。并将结果在报纸上公布。
