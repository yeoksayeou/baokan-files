　　Shijingshan and Other Four Steel Plants and Mines
    Trial Filling of Planning Forms Yields Good Results
    [Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Group of the former Steel Industry Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry convened the first production planning work conference of various units at the end of April this year. It was decided that future planning work should concretely express production tasks through planning forms, and the forty types of steel industry product planning forms drafted by the Ministry of Heavy Industry should be tested in the four plants and mines of Shijingshan, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Longyan. According to the trial filling results of each plant and mine, it proves that the forty types of forms are basically completely applicable, except for a few individual items. Except for Shijingshan Plant, where a very small number of forms were not completely filled out, all other plants were able to fill out all of them, and the accuracy rate averaged 70 percent. Based on the filled-out forms, on the one hand, the imbalance of production equipment capacity was discovered. For completing the planned production tasks, some had surpluses, while others had shortages. On the other hand, the degree of achievement of production tasks and the degree of accurate implementation of planning work were also understood. This allows for timely supervision and control of production. However, during the trial filling process, some units reversed the system of forms, and some numbers on the forms were incomplete or inaccurate.
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of future planning work, first, each plant and mine must establish a series of complete statistical systems (modifying or supplementing the original ones) to adapt to the needs of planning forms. At the same time, production management systems must be improved, such as work systems, material receipt and dispatch systems, product inspection systems, etc. In the current situation, the planning departments of each plant should maintain close contact with other departments to help establish statistical systems, and should ask on-site staff to assist in filling out forms. After a sound statistical system is in place, the planning forms should basically be filled out and synthesized by the planning department. Secondly, regarding planning work, the leaders of each plant and mine must recognize that this is a measure to assist in the development of production and the implementation of scientific management, and not to increase the burden on the factory. The personnel doing planning work should also realize that compiling a plan is an economic work, not purely technical. They should have an economic perspective based on technology, and not make the plan become numbers in engineering theory. How to correct the basic viewpoint of enterprise economic planning is what planning staff must deeply understand and strive to learn and study. Third, there must be full preparation before filling out the forms. There should be collective learning and joint research, and it should not be monopolized by one party or dependent on any one party. Under the leadership of the head of the planning department, each group should maintain close contact at all times. When filling out or correcting certain relevant information, the opinions of experienced workers and engineers should be carefully and cautiously listened to. When comprehensively reviewing and determining, the responsible persons of the plant and each production workshop should jointly study and determine it.

### 石景山等四钢铁厂矿  试填计划表报成绩良好

　　石景山等四钢铁厂矿
    试填计划表报成绩良好
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部原钢铁工业局筹备组于今年四月底召开了各单位第一次生产计划工作会议，决定今后的计划工作，应通过计划性的表格将生产任务具体表现出来，同时并将重工业部所拟定的四十种钢铁工业产品计划表报在石景山、天津、唐山、龙烟四厂矿试填。根据各厂矿试填结果，证明四十种表报除少数个别项目外，基本上是完全适用的。除石景山厂有极少数的表没有填写完整外，其余各厂均能全部填写，并且确实程度平均达百分之七十。根据所填表报，一方面发现了生产设备能力的不平衡性，对完成计划生产的任务，有的富余，有的则不足；另一方面也了解了生产任务达成的程度及确实执行计划工作的程度。这样就可以及时地对生产进行监督与控制。但在试填过程中，有的单位颠倒了表报的系统，有的表报上某些数字不完整、不准确。
    为使今后计划工作顺利完成，首先，各厂矿必须建立一系列的完善的统计制度（就原有的基础上加以修正或补充），以适应计划表报的需要。同时必须健全生产管理制度，如工作制度、材料收发制度、产品检验制度等。在目前的情况下，各厂计划课应与其他部门取得密切联系，帮助建立统计系统，并须请各现场工作人员协助填表；到有了健全的统计制度后，计划表报基本上应由计划部门填写和综合。其次，对计划工作，各厂矿领导人必须认清这是协助发展生产与实行科学化管理的措施，而不是增加工厂负担。做计划工作的人员，也应该认识到编制计划是一种经济性的工作，不是纯技术的，应该有以技术为基础的经济观点，不要使计划成为工程学理上的数字。如何端正企业经济计划的基本观点，这是目前计划工作人员所必须深切体会和努力学习钻研的。第三、填表前首先要有充分的准备，要集体学习，共同研究，不可由一方面包办或依赖任何一方面。在计划课长领导之下，各小组应经常保持密切联系。在填写或修正某些有关资料时，要认真慎重地听取有经验的工人和工程师的意见。在综合审核确定时，应由厂方及各生产车间的负责人共同研究确定。
