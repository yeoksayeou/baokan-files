　　Youth Art Theater and Youth Service Department
    In Street Performance to show the masses of the United States paper tiger
    [Report from this newspaper] The China Youth Art Theater has been using diverse forms of propaganda since July 19th to conduct organized and planned anti-American aggression propaganda activities. On the 19th, the theater held a forum attended by family members of the theater staff and representatives of the masses from the First District to oppose American aggression. After listening to a report on the current world situation, many of the people present expressed their anger at the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. An old man surnamed Guo from the First District said angrily: "I am a military dependent, with six children, four of whom have joined the army. If the American bandits dare to start a war, I will definitely send the two children who have not yet joined the army to the front lines." The next day (July 20th), a propaganda evening was held, and many citizens actively participated. The evening was filled with anti-American aggression sentiments. A bricklayer surnamed Zhang pointed to the American interventionist troops in the living newspaper drama "Paper Tiger" and said: "It's really a paper tiger, it can be broken with one poke, who would be scared by them!" A nursery worker voluntarily explained to an old lady how the people of Southeast Asia in the song and dance living newspaper drama "Defend World Peace" are all one family with the Chinese people and all oppose American imperialism. The evening ended with a roar of slogans.
    On July 21st, the Youth Theater and the Youth Service Department jointly formed a 200-person street propaganda team, using radio propaganda, makeup performances, and other methods to conduct parade propaganda in the Dongdan, Dongsi, and Bamiancao areas. Many spectators pointed to the portrait of General Kim Il-sung on both sides of the team and shouted, "This is Kim Il-sung, beating the stinky Americans!" Citizens along the way pointed to a string of American prisoners escorted by the Korean People's Army and war criminals such as MacArthur and Syngman Rhee in the makeup team and issued condemnations. The joint propaganda team also performed the living newspaper drama "Paper Tiger" on Ma Shi Street and East Chang'an Street, satirizing the embarrassing situation of the American interventionist troops being severely beaten by the Korean People's Army, which was met with warm applause from thousands of spectators around.

    The Youth Service Department is actively carrying out propaganda activities to "Oppose American Aggression against Taiwan and Korea." The department convened more than 100 department members, volunteer work group members, reading group members, and choir members on the 20th for a propaganda mobilization meeting. The meeting reported on the current situation in Korea and called on everyone to actively participate in propaganda activities. After the meeting, an 80-person propaganda team was formed. On July 21st, it began to join the Youth Art Theater propaganda team and set off for street propaganda activities, and on the morning of the 23rd, it set off for the second propaganda activity. The department has planned to erect large propaganda signs in front of the door, create and post detailed maps of Korea, announce the Korean war situation daily, install loudspeakers to explain in detail, and introduce the combat life of the Korean people, while broadcasting Korean songs.

　　青年艺术剧院和青年服务部
    在街头进行化装表演给群众看美国纸老虎
    【本报讯】中国青年艺术剧院自七月十九日开始，利用多种多样的宣传方式，有组织、有计划进行反对美帝侵略的宣传活动。该院十九日召开了一个由院内家属与第一区群众代表参加的反对美帝侵略座谈会。许多到会的群众听完了关于目前世界形势的报告后，纷纷表示对美帝的侵略罪行的愤怒。第一区姓郭的老大爷愤愤地说：“我是个军属，六个孩子，有四个都参军了。如果美国强盗敢发动战争。我一定将还没有参军的两个孩子也送上前线。”第二天（七月二十日）接着举行宣传晚会，参加的市民群众很踊跃。晚会中充满了反对美帝侵略的情绪，一位姓张的泥瓦工人指着活报剧《纸老虎》中的美帝干涉军说：“真是纸老虎，一戳就破，谁会让他们吓住啊！”一位托儿所的工作人员自动向一位老大娘解释着歌舞活报剧《保卫世界和平》中的东南亚各民族人民，如何和中国老百姓都是一家人，都是反对美帝国主义的意义。晚会在海潮怒吼般的口号声中结束。
    七月二十一日，青年剧院与青年服务部联合组成了一支二百人的街头宣传队，利用广播宣传、化妆表演等方式，在东单、东四、八面槽一带游行宣传。许多观众在队伍两旁指着金日成将军的像片喊道：“这就是金日成，打臭老美的！”沿途的市民并指着化妆队伍中由朝鲜人民军押解着的一串美俘和麦克阿瑟、李承晚等战争罪犯发出了斥骂的声音。联合宣传队又在马市大街和东长安街的街头表演了活报剧《纸老虎》，讽刺美干涉军被朝鲜人民军痛击的狼狈情形，周围千百个观众报以热烈的掌声。

    青年服务部积极展开“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜”宣传活动。该部于二十日召集部友、义务工作组及读书小组组员、合唱团员百余人开宣传动员大会。会中报告了目前朝鲜形势号召大家积极参加宣传活动。会后即组成了八十余人的宣传队。并已于二十一日开始与青年艺术剧院宣传队会合出发街头展开宣传活动，并于二十三日上午出发作第二次宣传。该部已计划进行在门前广场上树立大幅宣传牌，制贴详细朝鲜地图，每日公布朝鲜战况，安置扩音机详加解说，并介绍朝鲜人民战斗生活，同时放送朝鲜歌曲。
