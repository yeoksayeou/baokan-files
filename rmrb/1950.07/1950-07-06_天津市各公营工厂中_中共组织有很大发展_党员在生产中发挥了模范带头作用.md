　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd—The organization of the Communist Party of China has achieved great development among the workers of state-owned factories in Tianjin, and party members have played an exemplary role in production. In the early days of Tianjin's liberation, cadre party members and underground party members accounted for only 1.9% of all employees. With the gradual improvement of workers' awareness, a large number of activists emerged. After the Party's organization was made public last September, the connection between the Party and the masses became closer, the working masses had a further understanding of the Party, and a large number of activists applied to join the Party. As of June 20 this year, the number of party members has accounted for 9.26% of all employees.
　　When state-owned factories in Tianjin launched the production competition movement in May, party members all drew up production plans, playing a leading role among the workers. For example, the plan drawn up by Liu Changfu, a party member and foreman of the steel rolling section of Tianjin Steel Plant, not only ensured that his own shift completed the task, but also ensured that the two shifts progressed side by side to jointly complete the task. Liu Guanghe, a party member of the steelmaking section, guaranteed to train a crane operator during the competition. The realization of this plan promoted the signing of apprenticeship contracts. When the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau overhauled its No. 1 generator, Liu Jingzhou, a party member who was repairing the water pump section, started work early while the water pump was still hot, completing eight days of work in one day and night. Sun Fenghe, a party member of the dyeing and finishing factory, climbed into the boiler to repair the furnace bars despite the high temperature of two hundred degrees. Pan Changyou, a party member of Tianjin Steel Plant, repaired the front wall of the open hearth furnace at a high temperature of more than 400 degrees; during the furnace repair on May 1st in the steel rolling section, party member Liu Changfu and League member Sun Fengxi took the lead in entering the furnace at a temperature of more than 300 degrees for hot repair, completing the seven-day task in one and a half days. In production, party members also patiently educated backward workers, so that production was further improved. For example, in the sixth group of the combined silk A class of the No. 3 Cotton Mill, four party members had good production results and red flags were often hung on their machines. After the production competition was launched, other groups did not dare to challenge them. The branch then separated the party members of the group to promote the other groups, so that the production competition could be carried out smoothly. The production efficiency of the sizing room in the cloth workshop of the No. 4 Cotton Mill has always been relatively low, and only more than 270 pieces were sized every day. After the party branch patiently educated them, the production efficiency gradually increased, and now it has reached a record of 400 pieces per day.

　　天津市各公营工厂中
    中共组织有很大发展
    党员在生产中发挥了模范带头作用
    【新华社天津三日电】中国共产党的组织，在天津市公营工厂职工中，获得很大发展，并发挥了党员在生产中的模范作用。在天津解放初期，干部党员与地下党员只占全部职工的百分之一点九。随着职工觉悟程度的逐步提高，大批积极分子相继涌现。至去年九月，党的组织公开以后，更密切了党与群众的联系，工人群众对党有了进一步的认识，大批积极分子都申请入党。截止今年六月二十日，党员的数量已占全体职工的百分之九点二六。
    津市公营工厂在五月份发动生产竞赛运动时，党员都拟订了生产计划，在工人群众中起了带头作用。如天津钢厂轧钢部领班党员刘长福订的计划，不单保证自己一班完成任务，并且做到了两班齐头并进，共同完成任务。炼钢部党员刘广和，保证在竞赛中培养一个开天车的技术工人，这个计划的实现，推动了师徒合同的订立。天津电业局检修一号机时，修理水泵部分的党员刘景洲，趁水泵热时提前动工，一昼夜完成了八天的工程。染整厂党员孙凤和，冒二百度的高温爬进锅炉修炉条。天津钢厂党员潘长有，在四百多度的高温下修理马丁炉的前墙；轧钢部在五月一日修炉时，党员刘长福、团员孙凤喜带头，进入三百多度的炉内热修，使七天的任务一天半完成。在生产中，党员并耐心地教育了落后工人，使生产进一步提高。如中纺三厂合丝甲班六组，有四个党员生产成绩好，车上经常挂着红旗，生产竞赛展开后，别组都不敢挑战。支部便将该组党员分开，去推动各组，使生产竞赛得以顺利展开。中纺四厂布场浆纱间的生产效率向来比较低，每天只浆到二百七十多匹就不浆了，经党支部耐心地向他们进行教育后，生产效率逐步提高，现已达到每天浆四百匹的纪录。
