Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to Reuters' front-line dispatches from Korea, the tank units of the Korean People's Army crossed the Kum River on the 14th – the battle line that the U.S. aggressors boasted would "never retreat." According to a United Press dispatch from the U.S. forward command in Korea on the 15th, thousands of People's Army soldiers crossed the Kum River near Gongju, northwest of Taejon, on the 15th and established a fifteen-mile-long flank. This location is less than twenty miles from Taejon. News of the U.S. military's retreat has been confirmed by MacArthur Headquarters' Public Communique No. 79, issued on the 15th. The communique admits that U.S. forces have been forced to retreat and have adopted a defensive posture. The Kum River, north of Taejon, was referred to by MacArthur Headquarters' communique on the 12th as a "natural barrier to defend tanks". The American aggressors, in desperate retreat, had hoped to find a respite at the Kum River. The rapid crossing of the Kum River by the Korean People's Army demonstrates that neither the U.S. Air Force, Army, tank units, Dean, Walker, nor "natural barriers" such as the Han River or the Kum River can stop the victorious advance of the Korean People's Army. (Note: Dean was appointed Commander of U.S. Army forces in Korea by MacArthur on July 2nd; because the U.S. military was suffering successive defeats, MacArthur appointed Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army stationed in Japan, to replace him on July 12th.)
    
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced on the evening of the 15th that the People's Army, pursuing and annihilating fleeing enemies in the Chungju area of North Chungcheong Province, liberated the county seat of Goesan (southwest of Chungju) and its affiliated Yeonpung District in North Chungcheong Province on the 14th, and is now continuing to advance.

The Syngman Rhee remnants and the U.S. military headquarters, which had fled to Taejon, are fleeing southeast from Taejon under the fierce offensive of the People's Army.

On the 14th, U.S. Air Force aircraft once again invaded Wonsan, indiscriminately bombing the city and nearby rural areas, destroying many schools, hospitals, and cultural facilities, causing many casualties among residents.

In the air battle over Wonsan, the People's Army Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units shot down two U.S. bombers.

　　朝鲜人民军渡过锦江逼近大田
    李承晚残匪和美军参谋部由大田向东南逃窜
    【新华社十六日讯】据路透社朝鲜前线消息：朝鲜人民军的坦克部队已于十四日渡过锦江——美国侵略者所吹嘘谓“决不后退”的战线。又据合众社朝鲜前进指挥部十五日电称：人民军数千人十五日已在大田西北的公州附近越过锦江，并建立了一个十五英里长的侧翼战线。该地离大田不足二十英里。美军撤退的消息，并已被麦克阿瑟总部十五日发表的第七十九号公报证实。该公报承认美军已被迫撤退，并采取守势。在大田以北的锦江曾被麦克阿瑟总部的十二日公报称为“防御坦克的天然屏障”。狼狈溃退的美国侵略者曾满怀希望，能于锦江获喘息机会。朝鲜人民军的迅速越过锦江，说明了无论美国空军、陆军，坦克部队，迪安、瓦克，或者是汉江、锦江等“天然屏障”，都不能阻止朝鲜人民军胜利前进。（按：迪安是七月二日由麦克阿瑟任命的朝鲜美陆军总司令；因为美军节节败退，七月十二日麦克阿瑟又任命美驻日第八军军长瓦克代替他。）
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十五日晚公布：在忠清北道忠州方面追歼逃敌的人民军，十四日解放了忠清北道的槐山县府所在地（忠州西南）及其所属延丰区，现正继续向前挺进。
    曾逃往大田的李承晚残匪和美军参谋部，在人民军的猛烈进攻下，正从大田向东南逃窜。
    美空军机群十四日再度侵袭元山，对市内与近郊农村进行盲目炸射，炸毁学校医院与文化设施多处，居民死伤甚众。
    在元山上空的空战中，人民军的空军与高射炮部队击落美轰炸机两架。
