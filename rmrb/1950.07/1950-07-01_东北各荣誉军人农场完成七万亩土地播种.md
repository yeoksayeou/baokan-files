Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The twenty-five veterans' farms in Northeast China have timely completed their sowing plans for 70,000 mu of land and are now beginning summer hoeing. This year, over 3,500 veterans are participating in production at the farms, using 120 tractors and over 600 new-style farm implements. With the exception of a few farms limited by objective conditions, most have exceeded their sowing targets. Helingeer Farm in Songjiang Province sowed 25,620 mu, including 20,790 mu of newly reclaimed land, exceeding the target by more than 28 percent. The Yilahala Farm in Heilongjiang Province also exceeded its original sowing plan by 506 mu. The Northeast People's Government attaches great importance to organizing veteran production. Before the spring plowing, the Northeast Veterans and Demobilization Affairs Management Committee allocated 30 billion yuan (Northeast currency) to support the establishment and expansion of the farms, and its affiliated Veterans' Mechanical Iron Factory produced 900 new-style horse-drawn farm implements (500 of which are summer hoeing implements) for distribution to the farms. During the spring plowing, the committee also sent personnel twice to conduct in-depth guidance and comfort visits to the farms, greatly encouraging the veterans' production enthusiasm. The veterans have spontaneously launched production competitions. Many veterans have learned how to drive tractors and other agricultural scientific and technical skills during the intense spring plowing season.

　　东北各荣誉军人农场完成七万亩土地播种
    【本报讯】据新华社沈阳电，东北二十五个荣誉军人农场，已及时完成了七万亩土地的播种计划，现正开始转入夏锄。今年参加各农场从事生产的荣誉军人共达三千五百余人，他们使用了一百二十台拖拉机和六百余台新式农具，除个别农场因客观条件限制外，一般都超过播种任务。松江省鹤立农场播种面积两万五千六百二十亩，其中新开荒地达两万零七百九十亩，超过任务百分之二十八强。黑龙江省之伊拉哈农场亦超过原订播种计划五百零六亩。东北人民政府对组织荣军生产非常重视。东北荣军与复员事务管理委员会于春耕前拨出三百亿元（东北币）扶助建立和扩大各农场，并由所属各荣军机械铁工厂制出九百台新式马拉农具（其中五百台为夏助农具）发给各农场使用。在春耕中，该会又两次派员深入各农场进行指导与慰问，对荣军生产情绪鼓励甚大。荣军纷纷自动展开生产竞赛。许多荣军在紧张的春耕中，学会了驾驶拖拉机及其他农业科学技术。
