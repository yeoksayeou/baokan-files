　　The Marriage Law Gave Me Freedom!
    Qian Ying
    “Prohibit interference with widows' freedom of marriage.” When I read this sentence in the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, I couldn't help but recite it over and over a dozen times. I really didn't know how to describe my feelings at that time. I only remember suddenly throwing away the newspaper in my hand and shouting, "I am free!"
    I am only twenty-nine years old, but I have been a widow for thirteen years. These thirteen years have been so hard on me!
    When I was only two years old, my mother betrothed me to my aunt's son—Ci Ping.
    When I was in the first semester of junior high school, busy preparing for the final exams, I suddenly received a letter from home saying that there was an urgent matter and I should return home immediately. I thought my mother was sick and rushed back, regardless of everything. —Good heavens! It turned out they wanted me to marry my cousin Ci Ping, who was dying, three days later. I firmly opposed it. My mother said to me, "Once you are betrothed, you are someone else's person. My aunt said that there are few people in her family, and Ci Ping's illness is gradually getting worse, and there is no one to take care of him, so she wants you to take good care of him." I asked my mother why she wanted to marry me to a dying person. She said, "Don't say such unlucky things." Then she said, "This is also your bitter fate!"
    My only form of resistance was crying. But what was the use of crying? Three days later, I was carried away confusedly. When I got to his house, I saw that Ci Ping—let's call him my husband—was already lying in bed, unable to move due to illness. I spent all day and night brewing soup and feeding him medicine, and my aunt spent all day and night praying to gods and Buddhas for him. What use were the gods? He died in less than half a month, and from then on, I became a widow!
    As soon as the dead man was sent up the mountain and I returned home, my aunt's first sentence to me was: "A woman who has lost her husband should go out less, otherwise people will gossip; and don't even think about remarrying. If the young mistress of a wealthy family remarries after her husband dies, she will truly lose the face of three generations of ancestors. The ancients said, 'A good woman does not serve two husbands,' and that is considered chaste." I kept these words firmly in my heart, and I was determined to be a chaste woman—I never dared to go out during the day, and I spent the nights alone with the lonely lamp. In the long day, apart from making tea, cooking, washing clothes, and doing chores, there was nothing else related to me. My mother, aunt, and relatives all praised me, saying that I knew how to keep "women's virtue." Alas! How could they know the pain in my heart! I often thought of my classmates at school, how happy their lives must be! Wasn't I the same as them? Why should I be locked up like in a prison now? I once asked to go back to school to study, but my aunt said: "What's the use of women studying? Besides, a woman who has lost her husband is with male teachers all day long, what would that be like!" I couldn't find a reason to object to this statement, and I had no ability to object, so I could only cry secretly, blaming my bitter fate…
    In the winter of my twenty-sixth year, my elder cousin, who had been working outside, returned home. After he understood my situation, he sympathized with me very much and tried his best to persuade my aunt to let me go to school, but my aunt firmly refused. He often lent me the books he brought back and often told me about things outside. Ten years of sadness, loneliness, pain, and boredom... only then did I feel a little joy and warmth. Gradually, we developed a deep affection, and finally he proposed marriage to me. At that time, I felt very frightened, "Wouldn't others laugh at me for being unchaste if I did this?" I refused to agree to him. But I felt very painful in my heart, because I really loved him! After thinking hard for several nights, after I couldn't help but admit this feeling of my own, I resolutely agreed to him. I thought this would be the beginning of my happy life, but who knew it would bring me even more bitter years!
    My elder cousin happily told my aunt about this, and she immediately flew into a rage, saying that this was "ruining the family reputation," was losing her face... and called me in, scolding me for being shameless, simply a bad woman, and scolding me for leading her son astray, enticing her son to marry a widow... and forbade me from speaking to my elder cousin again in the future. In his anger, my elder cousin left home early the next morning. Now my aunt was even fiercer, saying that I had forced her son away; and scolding me for being an enchantress, killing her son; even blaming all the unfortunate things in the family on me! Again and again, she scolded me to the point where I wanted to die, but when I thought of my elder cousin, especially the letter he left me before he left: "Endure it for a few more years! When I have a way to settle down, I will come and pick you up." No matter how painful it was, I was determined to endure it! The years after that were even more bitter...
    After liberation, everyone said that the Communist Party had come, and "the suffering people have turned over." What about me? I was still living a life of sorrow and suffering. I thought the Communist Party would not be able to manage so many things, and a widow like me should not think about turning over.

### 婚姻法给了我自由！

　　婚姻法给了我自由！
    倩英
    “禁止干涉寡妇婚姻自由。”当我从中华人民共和国婚姻法里读到这一句时，不禁反复的念了十几遍；我真不知道该怎样来讲述那时自己的心情，我只记得自己突然用力的丢开了手上的报纸，高叫一声“我得到自由了”！
    我只有二十九岁，可是我已经作了十三年的寡妇，这十三年的岁月挨得我好苦呵！
    我才两岁时就被母亲许配给了大姨母的儿子——次平。
    当我上初一下的一个学期，正在忙着准备期终考试的时候，突然接到家里来信，说是有急事叫我立刻回家。我一心以为是母亲病倒了，不顾一切的赶了回去。——天哪！原来是要我三天后同病得快要死了的次平表兄结婚。我坚决反对，母亲对我说：“许配给了人家，就是人家的人了。大姨母说她家里人手少，次平的病又渐渐地加重，没有人侍候，要你去好好的侍候他。”我问母亲为什么要把我嫁给一个要死了的人呢？她说：“不要说这种不吉利的话。”接着她又说：“这也是你的命苦呀！”
    我唯一反抗的表示就是哭泣。但是哭有什么用呢？三天后就那样糊里糊涂的把我抬走了。到他家一看，原来次平——就算是我的丈夫吧——已经是病得倒在床上不能行动了。我整天整夜给他烧汤喂药，大姨母就整天整夜为他求神拜佛。神有什么用呢？不到半个月他就死去了，从此我就作了寡妇！
    死人刚送上山，回到家里，大姨母第一句就对我说：“死了丈夫的人，要少出去走动，不然别人要说闲话的；更不要想着再嫁人，大户人家的少奶奶死了丈夫再嫁人，那真是会连祖宗三代的脸都丢尽了。古人说‘好女不事二夫’，这才算贞洁。”我把这些话牢记在心里，我决心要作一个贞洁的妇女——白天从不敢出门，晚上空守着孤灯；长长的一天里，除了烧茶、煮饭、洗衣、作活外，就再也没有与我相关的事了。母亲、大姨母和亲友们都夸奖我，说我会守“妇道”。唉！她们那里知道我内心里的痛苦呵！我常常想起学校里的同学们，她们的生活该多快活呵！我不也和她们一样的吗？为什么现在要像监牢一样的把我关起来呢？我曾经要求再到学校里去念书，但大姨母说：“女人家读书有什么用？再说一个死了丈夫的妇人，整天去和男先生们搞在一起，成什么话！”对于这种说法，我找不出理由来反对，我也没有能力去反对，我只有偷偷的哭泣，怨自己的命苦………
    在我二十六岁那年的冬天，一直在外面工作的大表哥回到了家里。当他了解了我的情形以后，非常同情我，竭力劝大姨母让我去读书，大姨母却坚决不肯。他常把带回的书借给我看，又常讲些外面的事给我听。整整十年的悲伤、孤寂、痛苦、烦闷……的生活，到这时才感到有一点快乐和温暖。渐渐的我们产生了深厚的感情，终于他向我提出了结婚的要求，当时我感到非常惊惶，“这样作别人不是要讥笑我不贞洁吗？”我不肯答应他。但我在内心里却感到非常痛苦，因为我实在也爱着他呀！当我苦思了几夜，不能不承认自己的这一份感情以后，就毅然的答应了他。我满以为这将是我幸福生活的开端，但谁知却带给了我更辛酸的岁月呵！
    大表哥很高兴的把这件事情告诉大姨母，她立刻大发脾气，说这是“败坏门风”，是丢她的脸……并把我叫了去，骂我不知羞耻，简直是个坏女人，又骂我带坏了她的儿子，引诱他的儿子想同寡妇结婚……并禁止我以后不许再同大表哥讲话。大表哥在盛怒之下，第二天一早就离开了家庭。这下大姨母可更凶了，说是我逼走了她的儿子；又骂我是妖妇，害死了她的儿子；甚至把家里一切不幸的事情，都归罪在我身上！两次三番骂得我想去寻死，可是一想到大表哥，尤其是他临别时留给我的信：“再忍受几年！等我有办法安家的时候就来接你去。”就不管有多痛苦，都决心熬下去！这以后的岁月，就更过得辛酸了……
    解放后，别人都说共产党来了，“受苦的人翻身了。”我呢？却还是照样过着愁苦日子。我想共产党那里会管得了这许多事，像我这个寡妇是不要想什么翻身的。
