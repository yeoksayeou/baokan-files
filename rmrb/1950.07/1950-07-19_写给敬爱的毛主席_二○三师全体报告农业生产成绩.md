Respected Chairman Mao:

Since you issued the instruction on December 15th of last year for the army to participate in the construction of the motherland, all the officers and soldiers of our division immediately responded to your call. The division's Party Committee immediately began surveying land, negotiating projects, and making various preparations for production. On March 30th, we comprehensively投入d ourselves into large-scale production.

A portion of the personnel participating in the water conservancy project of excavating a section of the Sanggan River siltation area, contracted for a total of 950,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Every soldier understood that it was a supreme honor to benefit the people, so no one wanted to fall behind. Leaders such as the division commander and deputy division commander also dug canals with the soldiers. Even with blisters on their hands, they did not rest. Communist Party members not only played a exemplary role in war and training, but also took the lead in the production front with a hundredfold effort. Bai Feng, the deputy section chief of the Propaganda Section, was selected as a work representative and labor model in the canal digging work. Soldier Party member Liu Quanyou created a record of a maximum daily output of seventeen cubic meters of earthwork and was named a labor hero. Party member Li Baoshan was a meritorious hero during the war and persisted in working despite being injured on the head during the canal digging. Many young soldiers strived to join the Youth League in production (285 people have gloriously joined the Youth League), while adult soldiers strived to join the Party in production (69 have become glorious Communist Party members). The Seventh Platoon of the Second Company of a certain regiment earned the title of "Tractor Platoon" with an average daily output of seven cubic meters of earthwork per person. For the entire division, the average daily earthwork was 5.43 cubic meters per person, allowing us to complete the entire earthwork project twenty days ahead of schedule, and we have opened up many canals on 20,000 mu of wasteland, making good preparations for agricultural production next year.

In the midst of intense canal digging work, we still maintained the glorious tradition of the People's Army. We actively helped the masses in production. According to incomplete statistics, we dug 385 mu of land, irrigated 305 mu of land, plowed, hoed, leveled, and reclaimed 490 mu of land, sowed 81 mu of land, carried 51,896 loads of water, whitewashed 657 houses, built 117 zhang of walls, delivered 11,620 loads of manure, and weeded 13,600 jin of grass. Ground 7,838 jin of flour. Because we implemented your instructions, we won the enthusiastic support of the local people, and the masses automatically helped us solve many difficulties. The people of Guyi Village wrote on a banner they presented: "When we pick up our rice bowls, we think of the Liberation Army." A liberated soldier said: "When I was in the reactionary army, I forgot that I was a son of the working people, beat and scolded the masses, and robbed them of their belongings; after I joined the People's Liberation Army, I realized that everything must serve the people, and this is what Chairman Mao taught me."

As for our division's agricultural production, in more than two months, we cultivated a total of 1,800 mu of paddy fields, 1,171 mu of dry land, and 712.5 mu of vegetable gardens, totaling 3,700 mu, and planted another 10,453 trees.

To ensure a bumper harvest, we dug 7,488 zhang of canals, built 6 li of dikes, and repaired 32 bridges, using a total of 89,390 man-days, and accumulated 1,200,700 jin of fertilizer ourselves.

You taught us: to rely on the masses, we must help the masses. Our entire division used 10,000 man-days to help the masses build a 6-li-long dike, which can protect 3,000 mu of land and silt up 2,000 mu of land. The masses lent us 294,500 jin of rice straw, more than 48,000 jin of sorghum stalks, 64,583 jin of rice seeds, 17,167 pieces of wood of all sizes, and 1,300,400 jin of tree branches. They said: "Without the army led by Chairman Mao, we would not have today's life, and your engagement in production is also to reduce our burden."

We lacked experience in farming, so we exchanged labor for technical guidance from the peasants, so that our vegetables and crops grew as well as theirs. This year, coupled with the timely rainfall, we have the hope of a bumper harvest in the first year of production.

Respected Chairman Mao, we will continue to work hard to complete the task of hoeing and weeding to ensure this year's bumper harvest. We wish you eternal health!

The Entire Officers and Soldiers of the 203rd Division
July 7th

### 写给敬爱的毛主席  二○三师全体报告农业生产成绩

　　写给敬爱的毛主席
    二○三师全体报告农业生产成绩敬爱的毛主席：
    自从去年十二月十五日你发布军队参加祖国生产建设的指示以后，我师全体指战员立即响应了你的号召。师党委立即开始勘察土地，交涉工程，进行生产的各种准备。三月三十日，我们就全面的投入了大生产。
    参加挖掘桑干河某段淤灌区的水利工程的一部分人员，共包工九十五万立方土。战士们谁都懂得为人民造福是无上光荣的，所以谁也不甘落后，师长、副师长等领导同志，也和战士在一起挖渠。他们手上打了泡也不休息。共产党员们不仅在战争和练兵中起模范作用，在生产战线上也以百倍的努力带头领着大家干。宣传科副科长白烽在挖渠工作中，被选为工作代表和劳动模范。战士党员刘全有创造了日工十七方土的最高纪录，被评为劳动英雄。党员李保山在战争时期是大功功臣，在挖渠时头上受了伤，仍然坚持工作。许多青年战士都争取在生产中入团（已有二百八十五人光荣的参加了青年团），壮年战士们则在生产中争取入党（已有六十九名成了光荣的共产党员）。某团二连七班以平均每人每日七方土的纪录获得了“拖拉机班”的称号。就全师来讲，平均每人每日挖土五·四三方土，使我们提前二十天完成了全部挖土工程，并且已在两万亩荒地上开好了许多水渠，为明年农业生产做了很好的准备。
    在紧张的挖渠工作中，我们仍然保持了人民军队的光荣传统。我们积极帮助群众生产。据不完全的统计，掘地三百八十五亩，浇地三百零五亩，耕地、锄地、平地、开荒四百九十亩，播种八十一亩，担水五万一千八百九十六担，粉饰房屋六百五十七间，垒墙一百一十七丈，送粪一万一千六百二十担，锄草一万三千六百斤。磨面七千八百三十八斤。由于我们执行了你的指示，获得了当地人民的热烈拥护，群众自动帮助我们解决了不少的困难。故驿村老百姓在赠旗上写着：“端起了饭碗，想起了解放军”。一个解放战士说：“我在反动派军队里的时候，忘掉了我是劳动人民的儿子，打骂群众，抢群众的东西；我参加了人民解放军后，才知道一切要为人民服务了，这是毛主席教育了我”。
    至于我师的农业生产，在二个多月中，共开垦稻田一千八百亩，旱田一千一百七十一亩，菜地七百一十二亩五分，总计三千七百亩，另植树一万零四百五十三棵。
    为了保证丰收，我们曾挖渠七千四百八十八丈，筑堤六华里，修桥三十二座，共用人工八万九千三百九十个，自己积肥一百二十万零七千斤。
    你教导过我们：要依靠群众，必须帮助群众。我全师以一万个工帮群众修了一道六里长的堤，可以护田三千亩，淤出地二千亩。群众借给我们稻草二十九万四千五百斤，秫秸四万八千多斤，稻籽六万四千五百八十三斤，大小木头一万七千一百六十七根，树枝一百三十万零四千斤。他们说：“没有毛主席领导的军队，咱们就没有今天的日子，你们搞生产也还是为了减轻我们的负担。”
    我们对种地经验不足，我们就以劳动换取了农民的技术指导，使我们的菜和庄稼都和农民的长得一样好。今年又加上雨水调匀，使我们在头一年的生产就有了丰收的希望。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们将继续努力，完成锄草和拔草的任务，保证今年的丰收。祝你永远健康！
                                      二○三师全体指战员
                                                 七月七日
