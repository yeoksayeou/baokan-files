　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: TASS reports: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party published a statement in the "Neues Deutschland" on July 4th, responding to the joint statement of the seven Communist parties of Europe regarding the Schuman Plan.

　　The statement declared: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party welcomes the joint statement issued by the Communist parties of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg regarding the Schuman Plan, and the Central Committee hereby declares its support for this joint statement. This statement represents the mighty peace alliance of the Western European working class fighting against the war plans of American imperialism and its European henchmen. The joint statement of our brother parties in Western Europe is a major contribution to the people of Europe, especially the working people of West Germany, and will help them to establish an invincible peace front against the imperialist warmongers.

　　To this end, the German Socialist Unity Party calls on all German working people to actively and unitedly support this great fighting alliance of the international working class. Our party especially calls on the Communists, Socialists, Christian Democrats, and non-party workers in West Germany and Berlin to immediately reach agreements in various places and take firm and consistent action against the war preparations being carried out by the United States in West Germany; these war preparations are manifested in the establishment of mercenary forces, the manufacture of war materials, the preparation for blasting the Lorelei and important roads, and especially in the act of bringing West German imperialist elements into the so-called Schuman Plan.

　　The German Socialist Unity Party remembers the words of the great Stalin that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history, and it will redouble its efforts to carry out the struggle for peace in accordance with the decisions of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and the plans of the German Peace Committee; it will also strengthen the German Democratic Republic as the foundation of the National Front of Democratic Germany, and will give strong support to the fighting alliance of the European working class.

    响应西欧七国共产党联合声明
    号召全德人民拥护欧洲工人阶级的战斗联盟
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会于七月四日在《新德意志》报上发表声明，响应欧洲七国共产党关于舒曼计划的联合声明。
    声明宣称：德国统一社会党中央委员会欢迎法国、德国、意大利、英国、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡七国共产党发表的关于舒曼计划的联合声明，中央委员会兹特声明拥护这个联合声明。这个声明代表西欧工人阶级为反对美国帝国主义及其欧洲的帮手们的战争计划而斗争的声势浩大的和平同盟。我们西欧的兄弟党的联合声明，对于欧洲人民特别是西德的劳动人民是一个重大贡献，这将有助于他们建立一个反对帝国主义战争贩子们的不可战胜的和平阵线。
    为此，德国统一社会党号召全德国劳动人民积极地团结一致地拥护这个国际工人阶级伟大的战斗同盟。我们的党特别号召西德和柏林的共产党、社会党、基督教民主党以及无党派的工人立即在各地取得协议，采取坚决一致的行动，反对美国在西德进行的战争准备；这种战争准备表现在雇佣军的建立、制造战争物资、准备爆破女神崖及重要道路，特别是表现在把西德帝国主义分子带进所谓舒曼计划的这一行动上。
    德国统一社会党记起伟大的斯大林说过的德意志民主共和国的成立是欧洲历史的转折点这一句话，它将加倍努力按照世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的决定与德国和平委员会的计划，进行争取和平的斗争；它并将加强作为民主德国全国阵线基础的德意志民主共和国，并将给予欧洲工人阶级的战斗联盟以强有力的支持。
