　　Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Flood Control Project
        Largest Water Damage Protection Project
    After a personal survey by Soviet experts, it was determined that the largest water damage protection project for the Zhengzhou Bureau – approximately 891 kilometers along the Longhai Railway adjacent to the Yellow River – requires 50,000 cubic meters of rubble to protect the bank. Not counting all engineering costs, the unit price for mining these tens of thousands of rubble stones alone would require more than 900,000 *pian* of flour. To ensure the construction of the people's railway, the People's Government is determined to make a massive investment. Soldiers of the 1st Detachment of the Railway Engineering Corps have bravely accepted the arduous task of throwing stones, relying on their all-capable hands to create happiness for the people.

    Faced with the desolate site in the Zhongtiao Mountains, the soldiers overcame various difficulties such as lacking housing and water. First, they laid two temporary lines to facilitate unloading. The soldiers also used their ingenuity to create simple flatcars to replace handcarts on the rails. This solved the transportation difficulties and increased the speed of stone throwing, with each person throwing 7.8 cubic meters of stone per day.

    During the stone throwing, the rolling stones from the thirty stone chutes were like a volley of cannons, and the steep cliff more than 40 meters above the Yellow River's surface sent yellow sand swirling, covering the sky. The soldiers' faces were covered with a layer of yellow dust, and even their mouths were full of dirt. This iron army has established the idea of a "permanent combat team." Currently, rubble is being continuously transported, and the soldiers are fighting with full labor enthusiasm to complete the task.

            Beside the Wei River
    The 992-kilometer levee protection project in Weinan is arduous and great. The Wei River, carrying countless small rivers from Guanzhong, rushes fiercely southwest from the highlands opposite the 992-kilometer marker, like a vicious snake devouring the south bank. It forms a vortex along the foot of the levee, meandering for three kilometers before turning northeast. The disasters that have occurred here over the past decade are impossible to count. Vice Ministers Wu and Lü of the Ministry of Railways, Soviet experts, Director Wu of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, and others have come here since March of this year to survey, plan, and inspect the construction. To completely eradicate this disaster, the first step of the plan will be expanded: the original plan to throw 55,000 cubic meters of rubble and repair the dam, installing 303 columnar head piles, will now be augmented by throwing 30,000 cubic meters of rubble, adding 49 waterproof dams and 105 head piles, and drafting a long-term plan to dredge the sandbar channels and divert the water flow.

    To complete this arduous and great task according to plan, the working people are working intensely. To avoid affecting normal train operation, unloading work is mostly carried out at night. At night, the river wind howls, stirring up sand and gravel from the shore, and the rushing water slams against the rubble being thrown down. Workers on and off the cars are calling out and working nervously. During the day, the workers are immersed in mud, throwing rubble and driving wooden piles, with the silt on the river beach sometimes sinking to their waists. Currently, the workers have thrown 24,000 cubic meters of rubble and driven 408 head piles; they are overcoming all difficulties and are determined to complete this great project by the end of August.

　　郑州铁路局的防洪工程
        最大的水害防护工程
    经苏联专家的亲自勘察，认为郑州局最大的水害防护工程——陇海线紧滨黄河的八九一公里附近，需抛片石五万立方，护住岸脚。不算一切工程费用，仅开采这几万片石的单价就需要九十多万片面粉。人民政府为保证人民铁路的建设事业，决心进行庞大的投资，铁道兵团一支队的战士们也勇敢的接受了艰巨的抛石任务，要凭一双万能的手，替人民创造幸福。
    战士们在面对着中条山的荒凉的现场，克服了没有房屋住，没有水喝的种种困难。首先铺设了两条便线，便利了卸车；战士们又开动脑筋，创造了简易的平车，来代替钢轨上的手推车。解决了运送困难，使抛石速度增加，每人每天抛石达七点八立方。
    抛石的时候，三十个溜石槽的滚石犹如排炮齐鸣，距黄河面四十多公尺高的陡壁，黄沙飞卷，遮满天空。战士们满脸遮上一层黄土，甚至嘴里也都是土。这一支铁军树立了“永久战斗队”的思想。目前片石正源源不断运来，战士们正怀着饱满的劳动热情，为完成任务而战斗着。

            渭水边上
    渭南九九二公里的路堤防护工程，是艰巨而伟大的。渭水夹着关中无数小河，从九九二公里对面高地上，激流折奔西南，像一条凶恶的蛇在吞噬着南岸。沿着路堤脚下汇成漩涡，蜿蜒三公里，才转向东北方向。十多年以来，这里发生的灾害已无法统计。铁道部武副部长、吕副部长、苏联专家、郑州铁路管理局吴局长等，从今年三月起，都先后来这里勘察、订计划及检查施工情况。为了彻底铲除这一灾害，将第一步计划扩大：原定投片石五万五千立方，整修水坝、装置柱木抱头桩三百○三个；现在增抛片石三万立方，添建防水坝四十九座及抱头桩一百○五个，并拟具了疏浚沙滩河道、转移水流的长远计划。
    为了按照计划完成这一艰巨而伟大的任务，劳动人民正紧张地工作着。为了不影响正常行车，卸石工作多在夜间举行。夜里河风呼呼地卷起岸上的沙石，流水冲击抛下的片石哗哗作响。车上车下工友们在呼唤着紧张地工作。白天工友们浸在泥水里，抛片石、打木桩，河滩的淤泥有时深陷到腰间。现在工友们已抛了片石二万四千方，打好四百○八个抱头桩；他们正排除一切困难，决心在八月底完成这一伟大的工程。
