[Report from This Newspaper] During this year's spring planting and disaster relief and dike repair work, labor mutual aid organizations in rural areas across the country have greatly developed. The development of labor mutual aid organizations in the Northeast Administrative Region is relatively widespread. In Shulan, Jilin, and Qinglong, Rehe provinces alone, there are more than 13,000 mutual aid groups. In Zhuanghe County, Liaodong, the number of households organized accounts for 88 percent. In Andong County, it accounts for 70 percent, an increase of 20 percent compared to last year. In the old areas of North China and Shanxi, the areas with better mutual aid foundations in Hebei, and disaster areas, mutual aid organizations are also relatively common. For example, in the four counties of Yushe, Heshun, Zuoquan, and Xiyang in Shanxi, the number of households organized accounts for 80 percent. In Licheng, the number of households organized accounts for 94 percent. In the East China region, under the call to combine spring production with disaster relief and dike repair, the labor force organized in general areas of Shandong accounts for 50 to 60 percent, and in individual areas, it reaches 80 percent. In the disaster areas of Gaoyou, Yancheng, Shuyang, and Siyang in northern Jiangsu, some villages have been organized as entire villages. During the rush planting after the rain in Lianshui County, more than 8,000 plows were organized, with more than 30,000 male and female laborers participating in the rush planting. In Dangshan, northern Anhui, there are 2,505 production mutual aid plowing groups, with 27,335 participants. In Su County, Lingbi and other counties, there are 4,305 sideline mutual aid groups. In the old areas of northern Shaanxi in the Northwest, the labor force generally organized accounts for about 40 percent of the total labor force. The development of labor mutual aid organizations is also rapid in the new areas of various regions. For example, in 17 counties including Chang'an and Dali in Shaanxi, Northwest China, about 25,153 exchange labor groups have been organized, with 200,000 participants, accounting for about 34 percent of the total labor force. In other new areas such as Central South and East China, there are also many mutual aid groups organized by the masses under the old mutual aid habits, such as 496 mutual aid groups in the Chengguan District of Jingshan, Hubei, and 221 exchange labor groups organized in Liantang Village, Zhaoshi, Guangdong.

During this year's spring planting and disaster relief and dike repair period, the large-scale development of mutual aid organizations has played a significant role in improving agricultural cultivation techniques, ensuring increased production of cotton and grain, and completing spring repairs:

First, improving agricultural cultivation techniques. Many mutual aid groups have further developed in terms of fertilization, seed selection, pest control, and improved cultivation methods. Mutual aid groups in rural areas of Northeast China have widely adopted new and improved agricultural tools. In Shulan, Jilin, 542 mutual aid groups have achieved seed selection when planting soybeans. The Liu Wendeng group in Quanyan Village, Xi'an, Liaodong, adopted new methods of seed selection, fertilization, and intercropping. Mutual aid groups in the old areas of North China and Shanxi have been consolidated and developed in the work of improving cultivation techniques and increasing production. The Zhang Furen group in Xiaoduyugou, Yushe, Shanxi, collectively created a sowing plow (which is more labor-saving and easier to use than the old plow) and studied the application of 17 kinds of fertilizers and 14 kinds of pesticides to ensure an increase of 2.4 dou per mu.

Second, ensuring the completion of spring repair projects. There are many spring repair projects this year in various regions, mobilizing a large amount of manpower under the method of providing work as a form of relief. For example, in Shandong, Pingyuan, northern Jiangsu, and southern Jiangsu, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2 million people were mobilized. In Henan, Hebei, northern Anhui, and other regions, many laborers were also mobilized to go to the dikes for large and small spring repair projects. The disaster areas originally lacked manpower and animal power, and there were many production difficulties. In addition, a large number of strong laborers were mobilized to go to the dikes, so only by widely mobilizing men, women, old and young to participate in spring planting through mutual aid can we ensure that both spring planting and spring repair are not delayed. In Dazhangying, Fuyang, northern Anhui, most of the male laborers went to the dikes, and more than 100 women and semi-laborers helped each other to cultivate. All 400 mu of land in the village were harrowed once in four days and fertilized. In Zhongcun Village, Dingzhuang Township, Hudong District, Shuyang, northern Jiangsu, in addition to going to the dikes, only eight full laborers, seventeen semi-laborers, and one ox were left in the entire village. It was necessary to replant 400 mu of spring wheat and cultivate 600 mu of spring fields. Only after organizing mutual aid plowing was it possible to overcome production difficulties. In some villages in Gaoyou, northern Jiangsu, the masses have signed mutual aid contracts for cultivation and repair, so that those who go to the dikes can work with peace of mind, and those who stay at home to farm guarantee to cultivate the land of those working on the dikes well. The demobilized migrant workers and the continuing migrant workers in Huaining, northern Anhui, signed mutual aid contracts for cultivation and repair, each guaranteeing to complete their tasks.

　　在春耕播种和救灾修堤中
    劳动互助组普遍发展
    作到改良耕作技术，提高产量，并保证了春耕春修两不误。
    【本报讯】在今年的春耕播种和救灾修堤工作中，全国各地农村的劳动互助组织，已有大量发展。东北行政区劳动互助组织发展比较普遍。单吉林舒兰、热河青龙两县，即有互助组一万三千余组。辽东庄河县组织起来的户数占百分之八十八。安东县占百分之七十，比去年增加百分之二十。在华北、山西的老区，河北互助基础较好地区和灾区，互助组织亦较普遍。如山西的榆社、和顺、左权，昔阳等四县，组织起来的户数即占百分之八十。黎城组织起来的户数则占百分之九十四。华东区，在春耕生产与救灾修堤工作相结合的号召下，山东一般地区组织起来的劳力占百分之五十至六十，个别地区达百分之八十。苏北的高邮、盐城、沭阳、泗阳等灾区，有些村庄已全村组织起来。涟水县雨后抢种时即组织了八千多张犁，参加抢种的男女劳动力三万余。皖北砀山有生产互助拉犁组二千五百零五个，参加人数二万七千三百三十五人。宿县、灵壁等县，有四千三百零五个副业互助组。西北的陕北老区，一般组织起来的劳动力，达全部劳动力百分之四十左右。在各地新区劳动互助组织发展也很快。如西北的陕西长安、大荔等十七县，组织变工组约二万五千一百五十三个，参加人数二十万人，约占全部劳力百分之三十四。其他如中南、华东等新区，群众在旧互助习惯下组织的互助组也都很多，如湖北京山城关区有四百九十六个互助组，广东肇市莲塘村组织了二百二十一个变工组。
    在今年春耕播种和救灾修堤时期，由于互助组织的大量发展，对于改良农业耕作技术，保证棉粮增产，完成春修，均起了很大作用：
    第一、改良农业耕作技术。有许多互助组在施肥、选种、除虫、改良耕作方法等方面，均有进一步的发展。东北农村互助组，广泛采用了新式改良农具。吉林舒兰五百四十二个互助组，种大豆时，种籽都作到了粒选。辽东西安泉眼村刘文登组，采用了新的选种、施肥及间作方法。华北山西老区互助组，在改善耕作技术和提高产量的工作中，获得了巩固和发展。山西榆社小杜余沟张辅仁组，集体创作播种犁（比旧犁省工好用），并研究施用十七种肥料和十四种杀病虫害药剂，保证每亩增产二斗四升。
    第二、保证完成春修工程。各地今年春修工程很多，在以工代赈方式下动员了大量的人力。如山东、平原、苏北、苏南等地，据不完全统计：动员了二百余万人。河南、河北、皖北等地大小春修工程，也都抽调很多劳动力上堤。灾区本来人畜力都很缺乏，生产困难很多，加上大批抽调壮年劳动力上堤，所以只有广泛动员男女老幼互助参加春耕才能作到春耕春修两不误。皖北阜阳大张营男劳动力大部分上堤，由妇女及半劳动力百余人互助耕种，全村四百亩地，四天时间全部耙一遍，并施上肥料。苏北沭阳湖东区丁庄乡中村，全村劳动力除上堤外，只剩全劳动力八人，半劳动力十七人，和一条耕牛，需补种四百亩春麦与耕种六百亩春田，经组织互助拉犁后，才克服生产困难。苏北高邮有些乡村群众订立耕修互助合同，上堤的安心做工，留家种地的保证把堤工的地耕好。皖北怀宁复员民工与继续留堤民工，订立耕修互助合同，各自保证完成任务。
