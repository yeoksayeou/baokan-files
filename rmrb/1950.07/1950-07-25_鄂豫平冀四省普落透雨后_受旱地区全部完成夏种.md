　　After Widespread Heavy Rains in Hubei, Henan, Pingyuan, and Hebei Provinces
　　Drought-stricken Areas Complete Summer Planting
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Comprehensive news: Some drought-stricken areas in Hubei, Henan, Pingyuan, and Hebei provinces have completed the planting of late autumn crops. After the wheat harvest, most parts of Henan and Pingyuan provinces, the northeastern part of Hubei province, and the southern part of Hebei province experienced prolonged drought, making it impossible to carry out summer planting; early-planted autumn seedlings also withered. After the drought formed, the local people's governments quickly and systematically provided loans of seeds to help farmers solve the difficulty of seed shortages; and organized and led farmers to dig wells, open canals, repair ponds, and build dams to carry out drought resistance movements of watering and planting, carrying water for spot planting, and irrigating fields to protect seedlings. For example, the people's governments at all levels in Henan province loaned more than 13.6 million catties of grain and seeds during the summer planting. In addition to the existing water conservancy facilities, the province completed small-scale drought prevention and irrigation projects that could irrigate about 637,000 mu before and after the wheat harvest. The people's governments of counties, districts, and townships in the Xuchang area of ​​the province mostly held cadre meetings, people's representative meetings from all walks of life, or farmer representative meetings to specifically study drought resistance measures, and organize farmers to exchange labor and cooperate in watering and planting. In the three counties of Jia County, Yu County, and Xiangcheng in the area alone, more than 4,700 wells were dug. In Xuchang County, about one-third of the total summer planting area was planted by watering. The northeastern part of Hubei province generally experienced drought after the wheat harvest. The provincial people's government and the Huanggang Special Office loaned 10 million catties of drought-resistant seeds to farmers. Drought-stricken areas in Pingyuan and Hebei also launched a tense heat wave of drought-resistant planting at the same time. All localities have made great achievements in the drought resistance movement. For example, in Qinyang County, Pingyuan Province, 300,000 mu of the 400,000 mu of wheat stubble land was planted with watering, accounting for 75%.
　　In mid-to-late June, all drought-stricken areas had rainfall, but because the rainfall was uneven and the area of rainfall was not widespread enough, a few areas did not receive enough rainfall or did not receive any rainfall at all. Areas with rainfall, such as most of the 11 special zones in Xiangyang, Huanggang, Xiaogan in Hubei, Xuchang, Nanyang, and Chenliu in Henan, and some areas of counties in Heze, Liaocheng, Xinxiang, and Anyang special zones in Pingyuan Province, under the leadership of the local government, made a surprise rush to plant, and planting was completed within three to five days. Now the seedlings have all emerged, and some have already been covered with ridges and started hoeing. The drought-yellowed seedlings have mostly turned green again. The Zhengzhou, Shanzhou, Luoyang and other special zones in Henan Province, the Bo'ai, Qinyang, Xiuwu, Huojia and other counties in the Xinxiang Special Zone of Pingyuan Province, a total area of ​​1 million mu in all counties of the Anyang Special Zone, and the Handan and Xingtai special zones in southern Hebei Province, continued to carry out drought resistance struggles due to little or no rain and failure to plant universally.
　　On July 2nd and 3rd, there was light rain in some areas, and on the 9th, 10th, and 11th, there was heavy rain in all areas. The people's governments in the unplanted areas immediately took emergency measures, suspended summer levies and other work, and fully organized the masses to rush to plant. In the drought-stricken areas of Henan Province, the summer planting work was basically completed by the 15th. Song County completed planting on the 13th and continued to carry out summer levies, grain storage, and a shift to weeding seedlings. In addition to drawing major responsible cadres from various departments to lead each district after the rain, the Mixian government also loaned the green beans, black beans and other seeds purchased in advance from Xuchang and other places to the farmers. The farmers in each village helped each other to change work, and the planting was completed in three or four days. Farmers in Duzhong Village, Mianchi County, rushed to plant more than 400 mu in one day on the 11th. The masses reflected: "This rain is great, it would have been impossible to plant if it had been later."
　　Except for the mountainous areas of Jiyuan County in the Xinxiang and Anyang Special Zones of Pingyuan Province, which only received two or three inches of rain, there was heavy rain on the 11th. The two special zones promptly instructed each county to concentrate all its strength, lead the farmers, and rush to plant. Xinxiang and Wuzhi counties in Xinxiang Special Zone completed planting on the 13th, and the late autumn planting in the entire special zone was completed by the 15th. After the rain, the 1 million mu of barren land in the Anyang Special Zone was planted while taking advantage of the drought resistance foundation. It also called on the early-planted areas to check seedlings and replant, top-dress, and hoe seedlings at the right time. The Qixian County leading organs dispatched 35 cadres to form 9 working groups to help rush planting in villages near the county seat. The county party committee and the public security bureau also dispatched 5 heads of livestock to go to the countryside with the working group; the normal school had a three-day holiday to help planting in the village. The Yanqin County leadership decided to organize inspection teams to go to various districts and villages to inspect planting and weeding work in order to achieve a definite increase in production in the autumn. In the Handan, Xingtai, Hengshui, and Cangxian special zones of Hebei Province, which originally lacked rain, there were two heavy rains on July 2nd and 3rd, and on the 10th and 11th. All the land in the southern and central counties that had not been planted due to drought was planted while taking advantage of the rain. Therefore, this rainfall is not too late in terms of season, and it has little impact on the autumn harvest. According to experienced old farmers, if there are no other unexpected disasters in the future, there is still great hope for a bumper late autumn harvest this year.

　　鄂豫平冀四省普落透雨后
    受旱地区全部完成夏种
    【本报讯】综合消息：湖北、河南、平原及河北四省的部分受旱地区，已经完成晚秋下种。麦收以后，河南、平原两省大部，湖北省东北部和河北省南部地区，都曾久旱不雨，夏种工作无法进行；早种秋苗也发生了枯萎的现象。旱象形成以后，各该地人民政府即迅速有计划地贷放种籽，帮助农民解决缺种的困难；并组织领导农民打井、开渠、修塘、筑坝，展开浇地播种、挑水点种及灌田保苗的抗旱运动。如河南省各地人民政府，在夏种中共贷出粮食、种籽一千三百六十余万斤。全省除旧有的水利设备外，麦收前后又完成了约可浇地六十三万七千余亩的小型防旱灌溉工程。该省许昌专区各县区、乡人民政府，大多召开了干部会、各界人民代表会议或农民代表会议，具体研究抗旱办法，组织农民变工互助浇地点种。仅该区郏县、禹县、襄城三县，即打井四千七百多眼。许昌县约有占全部夏种面积三分之一的土地是用浇地点种办法下种的。湖北东北部地区，麦收以后曾经普遍呈现旱象。该省人民政府和黄冈专署贷放旱地种籽一千万斤给农民。平原及河北受旱地区也在同时掀起了紧张的抗旱点种热潮。各地在抗旱运动中，做出了很大成绩。如平原省沁阳县的四十万亩麦茬地，浇地下种者达三十万亩，占百分之七十五。
    六月中、下旬，各受旱地区曾先后落雨，但因雨量不匀，落雨面也不够普遍，少数地区雨量不够或根本未落。落雨地区如湖北襄阳、黄冈、孝感、河南许昌、南阳、陈留等十一专区的绝大部分及平原省的菏泽、聊城、新乡、安阳等专区各县的部分地区，在当地政府领导下突击抢种，三、五日内即播种完毕。现小苗已全部出土，有的已经罩垅，开始上锄，旱黄的禾苗又大部转青。河南省的郑州、陕州、洛阳等专区和平原省新乡专区的博爱、沁阳、修武、获嘉等县的大部地区，安阳专区各县总共一百万亩的面积，以及河北南部邯郸、邢台等专区，因雨少或未雨不能普遍下种，仍继续进行抗旱斗争。
    七月二、三两日，部分地区落小雨，九日、十日及十一日三天中，各地普落透雨。未下种地区人民政府立即采取了紧急措施，停止夏征等工作，全力组织群众抢种。河南省受旱地区，至十五日夏种工作即基本结束。嵩县十三日完成下种，继续进行夏征、屯粮和转入锄苗。密县政府于雨后除抽调了各科主要负责干部到各区领导外，并将预先从许昌等地购买的绿豆、黑豆等种籽贷放给农民。各村农民互助变工，突击三、四天，即下种完毕。渑池县笃忠村农民，十一日一天即抢种了四百多亩。群众反映：“这雨下得好，再迟了就种不上了。”
    平原省新乡、安阳两专区除济源县山区只落二三寸雨外，十一日普降透雨。两专区及时指示各县，集中一切力量，领导农民，突击下种。新乡专区的新乡、武陟两县，十三日即下种完毕，全专区的晚秋下种，至十五日已全部结束。安阳专区全区一百万亩白地，下雨后，即在抗旱基础上趁雨下种。并号召早种地区进行查苗补种，上追肥和适时锄苗。淇县各领导机关抽出三十五个干部，组成九个工作组到县城附近各村帮助抢种，中共县委、公安局并抽出牲口五头，随同工作组下乡；师范学校放假三天，回村帮助播种。延津县领导上决定组织检查组，赴各区、村检查下种，锄苗工作，以达到秋季确实增产。河北省原缺雨地区的邯郸、邢台、衡水、沧县等专区七月二、三日和十、十一日两次普雨，南部、中部各县一切因旱未种土地均已趁雨下种。因此次落雨在季节上说还不算晚，对秋收影响不大。据有经验的老农谈，如今后不再有其他意外灾害，今年晚秋丰收仍大有希望。（李文纯、冯应铎、孟韬、陈春雨、冠儒、新乡专署、安阳地委会、河北省人民政府）
