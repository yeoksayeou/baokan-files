[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] Tram Company Employees' Production Enthusiasm Soars, Unleashing a Wave of Innovation and Record-Breaking

    【News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency】Following the implementation of universal rewards for outstanding workers in production labor, based on the principles of "more work, more gain" and "considering both public and private interests," the Beijing Tram Company has witnessed a surge in employee morale, sparking a wave of innovation and record-breaking. To ensure uniform reward methods across departments and to strive for fairness and reasonableness, the company's Management Committee first formulated a draft reward regulation as the basis for evaluation. The Management Committee also absorbed respected and technically skilled workers to form the company-wide Reward Committee and unit-level Reward Sub-committees. Some evaluations were even entrusted to the workers of relevant departments for deliberation. This reduced instances of unfair rewards. The scope of this reward included outstanding workers and staff in all departments from January to May of this year. The evaluation work began last month and was completed in early July. A total of 1,057 people were rewarded, accounting for 70% of all employees, with a total bonus equivalent to 56,545 jin of millet. Among them, 74 people were rewarded for rationalization proposals, inventions, and technological improvements; 117 people received extra rewards; and 866 people received collective rewards (including 97 people who received awards for accident-free work). The 14 employees with the greatest contributions also received "Advanced Producer" medals. After this universal reward, employees realized that improving production is inseparable from their own interests. Thanks to the close coordination and step-by-step leadership and deployment of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, and the high production enthusiasm of the employees, the resolution of the company's first employee representative meeting to "launch a new record" movement has been transformed into practical action. Employees of the Civil Engineering Section originally proposed at the representative meeting to increase the daily replacement of rails from three to five, but they have now surpassed this goal, replacing six rails per day, with work efficiency doubling compared to before the employee representative meeting and the award ceremony. The machinists' team of the Repair Factory established a technical research association. Previously, the turning tool used for the rotary needle handle of the rotary cylinder disc was a dovetail knife. After Zhao Qin and Jiao Yaozong researched and changed it to a template knife, work efficiency increased by 9.6 times. To celebrate "July 1st" and facilitate everyone's use of good tools and parts to create new records, Liu Jingyuan contributed more than 300 pieces of fine instruments that are currently not easily available on the market. Case worker Zhao Yuting completed ten days of work in five days. The roller department of the electrical team collectively overfulfilled its task by 65% in five days. Forging team members Fan Baoquan and Yuan Shaokui completed seven days of work in four days.

　　电车公司职工生产情绪高涨
    掀起创新纪录运动热潮
    【京市新闻处讯】京市电车公司本着多劳多得、公私兼顾的原则，对生产劳动中的优秀职工进行了普遍奖励之后，职工生产情绪高涨，掀起了创造新纪录运动的热潮。该公司为了各部门在奖励时有统一的办法，并力求公平合理，首先由管委会制定了奖励条例草案，作为评奖依据；管委会并吸收群众中有威望、技术好的职工组织全公司的评奖委员会和各单位的评奖分会；有些评奖还交给有关部门的职工去评议。这样，就减少了奖励不公平的现象。这次奖励范围是包括各部门今年一月到五月的优秀工人和职员。评奖工作于上月开始，本月初旬完成。得奖的共有一千零五十七人，占全体职工百分之七十，共获奖金折小米五万六千五百四十五斤，其中因合理化建议、创造发明、技术改进得奖的有七十四人，获超额奖励的一百十七人，获集体奖励的八百六十六人（内有获无事故奖励九十七人）。贡献最大的十四名职工还获得了“生产先进”的奖章。经过这次普遍奖励以后，职工们认识到提高生产是与自己切身利益分不开的。由于党、政、工、团密切配合，有步骤地领导、布置，和职工生产情绪高涨，职工已把该公司第一次职工代表会议“开展新纪录”的决议，变为实际行动。土木课职工在代表会议上原提出换接轨道每日由三根争取换到五根，现在已突破这目标，每天换到六根，工作效率比职工代表会议和发奖以前提高一倍。修造厂机工班成立了技术研究会，旋电缸盘的转针木把所用的旋刀以前用凤头刀，经赵琴和焦耀宗研究改用样板刀后，工作效率提高了九·六倍；刘景垣为庆祝“七一”，便利大家使用好的工具零件以创造新纪录，献出三百多件目前市面不易买到的精细器具；案工赵玉亭五天完成了十天任务；电工班滚子部集体工作，五天超额完成百分之六十五；锻工班范宝泉、袁绍奎四天完成七天任务。
