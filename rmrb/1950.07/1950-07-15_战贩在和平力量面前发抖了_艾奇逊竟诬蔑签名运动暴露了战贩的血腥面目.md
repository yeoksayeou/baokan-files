　　War Profiteers Tremble Before the Forces of Peace
    Acheson Viciously Slanders Signature Campaign, Exposing the Bloodstained Face of War Profiteers
    Xinhua News Agency, July 14th—The rapid expansion of the peace signature campaign worldwide has made the imperialist war-mongers increasingly afraid, forcing them to abandon their strategy of ignoring it. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson publicly opposed the peace declaration for the first time at a press conference in Washington on July 12th. Acheson's statement particularly revealed the fear of U.S. imperialism regarding the rapidly developing peace signature campaign in the United States since the U.S. armed intervention in Korea. He began by saying: "I am convinced that the American people will not be fooled by the so-called 'World Peace Declaration' or 'Stockholm Appeal' which is currently being distributed and collected signatures for in our country." In an attempt to prevent people from participating in the peace signature campaign with shameless slander, Acheson described the peace declaration as "a propaganda trick in the Soviet counterfeit peace offensive." But then he immediately proved himself to be a war instigator who opposes the banning of atomic weapons. He said: The peace declaration declares that "the first country to use atomic weapons is guilty of crimes against humanity and should be denounced as a war criminal. Obviously, this is a baseless curse."
    Xinhua News Agency, July 14th—According to the U.S. Information Service in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement on the 12th, slandering the "Peace Declaration" which demands the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and which has been signed by more than two hundred million people, with the arrogance and arbitrariness characteristic of U.S. imperialists. Acheson arbitrarily said: The peace signature campaign is "a propaganda trick in the Soviet counterfeit 'peace offensive'." Acheson's arbitrariness immediately exposed his bloodstained face as a war profiteer; he is against peace and against the banning of atomic weapons. Acheson described the demand for the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, which comes from the conscience of mankind, as "an impracticable proposal made by the Soviet Union regarding atomic energy," and said: "The statement that the first country to use atomic weapons is guilty of crimes against humanity and should be denounced as a war criminal is obviously a baseless curse." Acheson slandered the counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army against the Syngman Rhee puppet army, which first invaded North Korea under the direction of the United States, as "aggression," and said: "With the crime of aggression, the weapons used are incidental." Acheson is playing a despicable "propaganda trick" here; he wants to scare the Korean people and the hundreds of millions of peace-loving people in the world by saying that the use of atomic weapons "is incidental," although the powerful world peace and democracy camp has proven that it will not be intimidated by Acheson's atomic threats.

　　战贩在和平力量面前发抖了
    艾奇逊竟诬蔑签名运动暴露了战贩的血腥面目
    【新华社十四日讯】和平签名运动在全世界的迅速扩大，已使帝国主义战争贩子越来越害怕，不能不放弃其置之不理的策略。美国国务卿艾奇逊七月十二日在华盛顿记者招待会上首次公开表明反对和平宣言。艾奇逊的声明特别透露了美帝国主义对于美国在朝鲜进行武装干涉以来，在美国飞速发展的和平签名运动的恐惧。他辟头就说：“我确信美国人民是不会受最近正在我国散发并征集签名的所谓‘世界和平宣言’或‘斯德哥尔摩决议’的愚弄的。”艾奇逊为了企图以无耻的诬蔑来阻止人民参加和平签名，竟把和平宣言说成是“苏联作伪的和平攻势中的一项宣传诡计”。但接着他马上证明了他自己是反对禁止原子武器的战争挑拨者。他说：和平宣言宣布“第一个使用原子武器的国家，就是犯了违反人道的罪行而应被斥为战争罪犯。显然地，这是毫无根据的嘲骂。”
    【新华社十四日讯】据美国新闻处华盛顿讯，美国国务卿艾奇逊于十二日发表声明，以美帝国主义分子所特有的横蛮和武断，污蔑已有两万万以上人民签字的要求无条件禁止原子武器的“和平宣言”。艾奇逊武断说：和平签名运动是“苏联作伪的‘和平攻势’中的一项宣传诡计”。艾奇逊的武断一下子就暴露了他的战争贩子的血腥面目，他是反对和平并反对禁止原子武器的。艾奇逊把无条件禁止使用原子武器的出于人类良心的要求说成是“苏联关于原子能所提的不能实行的建议”，并且说：“使用原子武器的第一个国家就是犯了违反人道的罪行而应被斥为战争罪犯的这种说法，显然是毫无根据的咒骂。”艾奇逊污蔑朝鲜人民军对于在美国指使下首先侵犯北朝鲜的李承晚傀儡军的反攻为“侵略”，并说：“有了侵略的罪行，那么使用的武器就是附带的了。”艾奇逊在这里正是玩弄着卑鄙的“宣传诡计”；他要想以使用原子武器“是附带的了”来吓唬朝鲜人民和世界上成万万的爱好和平的人民，虽然强大的世界和平民主阵营已经证明不会被艾奇逊的原子恐吓所吓倒。
