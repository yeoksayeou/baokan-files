　　Northern and Southern Railways
　　Wheat, Rice, and Flour Freight Rates Reduced Starting Today
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 12th] Following the recent reduction in freight charges, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has now submitted to and been approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to reduce the freight rates for three types of food grains—wheat, rice, and flour—on the northern and southern railways, effective July 13th. Wheat will be charged at 75% of the current freight rate, while rice and flour will be charged at 70%. The purpose of this measure by the Ministry of Railways is to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, as wheat harvesting has largely been completed in various parts of the north, and the new rice crop in the south is also nearing harvest, with large quantities of newly harvested grain about to enter the market.

    小麦大米面粉运价今起减低
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府铁道部继最近减低货物运费之后，现又呈准政务院财政经济委员会，从七月十三日起减低北方和南方铁路的小麦、大米、面粉三种食粮的运价。小麦按现行运价七五折计费，大米和面粉按七折计费。铁道部这个措施的目的是促进城乡物资交流，因为北方各地小麦已经大体收割完毕，南方新稻也快要收割，大批新收粮食即将进入市场。
