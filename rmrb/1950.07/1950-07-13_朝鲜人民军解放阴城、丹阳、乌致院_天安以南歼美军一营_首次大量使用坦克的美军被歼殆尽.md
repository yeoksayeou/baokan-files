Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the evening of the 10th that the People's Army troops advancing south from Cheonan, disregarding the frantic bombing and strafing by US Air Force squadrons, completely annihilated a surrounded US Army ground battalion in the area south of Cheonan on the 9th, and shot down two US aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: The heroic Korean People's Army completely annihilated the US invading tank units, used extensively for the first time by the enemy, north of Daejeon on the 11th. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th reported on the annihilation of the US tank units, stating that US forces used tank units for the first time in combat in the area 15 to 20 miles north of Daejeon on the 10th. However, these tank units "retreated after being heavily attacked by the Communists on the 11th, with all tanks destroyed, leaving only two survivors." "When US forces were about to be surrounded and soldiers were dwindling under heavy artillery fire, they finally retreated at noon from the positions previously won at great cost with tank-led counterattacks. A company of soldiers, 148 strong when transported from Japan to Korea two weeks ago, had only 30 remaining when retreating today, and it is estimated that 80 percent of the wounded were abandoned on the battlefield." "US forces are still fighting and retreating." Reuters also stated that US forces "suffered heavy casualties because rifle and machine gun fire swept their only retreat route."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced in a war report on the morning of the 12th that the People's Army continued to advance, inflicting significant blows on the enemy on all fronts. A unit of the People's Army pursuing the fleeing US Army ground forces and the remnants of the Syngman Rhee puppet army in the area south of Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do, liberated Ojichang, an important railway stronghold about 30 kilometers northwest of Daejeon, on the morning of the 11th. On the same morning, another unit of the People's Army liberated Danyang County and its surrounding areas, east of Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do. In the aforementioned battles, the People's Army annihilated and captured many enemy troops and seized many spoils of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced in a war report on the evening of the 11th that the People's Army troops continued to advance on the entire front. After crushing the enemy's stubborn resistance in the area of Eumseong County, Chungcheongbuk-do, a unit of the People's Army liberated Eumseong (on the railway line west of Chungju) and its surrounding areas at 2:00 PM on the 11th. In this battle, the People's Army annihilated and captured many enemy troops.

US Air Force squadrons continue to blindly bomb and strafe liberated South Korean cities and villages. On the 10th, US Air Force bomber squadrons raided Pyeongtaek, Icheon, Chungju, Suwon, and other places, indiscriminately bombing, causing damage to the houses and other buildings of many peaceful residents. The People's Army shot down three US B-29 bombers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced in a war report on the morning of the 11th that on the front lines, US Air Force units carried out large-scale bombing and strafing against the attacking People's Army to cover the retreat of their ground forces. However, the heroic People's Army units, after engaging in fierce battles with the US forces, are advancing victoriously southward. On the east coast, the US Navy fleet carried out barbarous shelling of peaceful cities and villages, attempting to prevent the southward advance of the People's Army ground forces, but the US fleet was repelled by the People's Army's courageous counterattack.

　　朝鲜人民军解放阴城、丹阳、乌致院
    天安以南歼美军一营
    首次大量使用坦克的美军被歼殆尽
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十日晚发表战报称：自天安南进的人民军部队，九日在天安以南地区不顾美空军机群的疯狂轰炸与扫射，完全歼灭了被包围的美军地面部队一个营，并击落美机两架。
    【新华社十二日讯】英勇的朝鲜人民军已于十一日在大田以北，把美国侵略者第一次大量使用的坦克部队，歼灭殆尽。合众社东京十一日电报道美国坦克部队被歼的情形称：美军于十日第一次在大田以北十五至二十英里地区以坦克部队参战。但这些坦克部队“十一日在共军猛烈攻击下向后败退，全部坦克牺牲，仅余二辆生还”。“美军在行将被围且士兵在猛烈炮火下渐告稀少时，终于在中午从以前花极大代价以坦克率队反攻时所赢得的阵地退下。某连士兵两周前自日本运来韩国时共有一百四十八名，今日退阵时仅余三十名，据估计，百分之八十的伤兵都被弃于战场”。“美军尚在且战且退中”。路透社亦称：美军“死伤甚众，因为步枪和机枪火力扫射着他们唯一撤退的道路”。
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜人民军总司令部十二日晨发表战报称：人民军在各战线上予敌军以重大打击，继续前进。在忠清南道天安以南地区追击溃逃的美军地面部队与李承晚残余伪军的人民军某部，于十一日晨解放大田西北约三十公里的铁路重要据点乌致院。同日晨，人民军另部解放了忠清北道忠州以东的丹阳县城及其附近地区。人民军在上述战斗中，歼灭与俘获敌军甚多，并缴获许多战利品。
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十一日晚发表战报称：人民军部队在整个战线上继续进攻。人民军某部在忠清北道阴城县方面粉碎敌人的顽抗后，已于十一日下午二时解放阴城（在忠州以西的铁路线上）及其附近地区。在这一战斗中，人民军歼俘敌军甚多。
    美空军机群继续对解放了的南朝鲜城市与乡村进行盲目炸射。十日，美空军轰炸机群空袭平泽、利川、忠州、水原等地，滥肆轰炸，致使许多和平居民的房舍与其他建筑遭受破坏。人民军共击落美Ｂ——二九式轰炸机三架。
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十一日晨发表战报称：在前线，美空军部队为掩护其地面部队退却，对进攻中的人民军施以大规模的轰炸和扫射。但是，英勇的人民军各部在与美军展开了猛烈的战斗后，正胜利地向南推进中。东海岸方面，美海军舰队对和平的城市和农村进行野蛮的炮击，企图以此来阻挡人民军地面部队的南进，但由于人民军勇敢的回击，已将美舰队击退。
