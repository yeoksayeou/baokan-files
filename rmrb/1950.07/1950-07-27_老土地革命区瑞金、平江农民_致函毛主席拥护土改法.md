From old land revolution areas, Ruijin and Pingjiang peasants,
    Wrote to Chairman Mao in support of the Land Reform Law
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] Li Zicai, Xie Yaonan and other eleven peasant representatives from Ruijin County, the "Red Capital" of the old land revolution area in Jiangxi Province, and Zeng Huamei and other thirty peasants from Sima Village in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, recently wrote letters to Chairman Mao, expressing their enthusiastic support for the Land Reform Law.
    The letter from the Ruijin County peasant representatives to Chairman Mao said: "Ruijin is the old red capital. Sixteen years ago, under your leadership, hundreds of thousands of peasants in our county overthrew the feudal forces, and were allocated land and houses, gaining liberation. Everyone lived a democratic and happy life. Since the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the Kuomintang bandits colluded with feudal forces - local bullies and landlords - and inhumanly massacred and buried Ruijin people alive. Thousands of revolutionary cadres and innocent peasants died tragically under the enemy's butcher knife. They also forcibly took away the land and houses we had been allocated. For more than ten years, we swallowed our anger and lived a slave life worse than that of cattle and horses. We believed that the revolution would surely be victorious, so we looked forward to the early arrival of revolutionary victory every day. Sure enough, this hope finally became a reality in August last year! Hundreds of thousands of peasants were overjoyed, some shed tears of happiness. Chairman Mao, it has been more than ten months since we regained our liberation! We demand a thorough emancipation. Therefore, we, representing the peasants of the whole county, report to Chairman Mao that we fully support the Land Reform Law promulgated by the Central People's Government. Land is our lifeline, and we are determined to take back our land from the landlord class!"
    The letter from the peasants of Sima Village, Pingjiang County, said: "We were extremely happy to see the new Land Reform Law. We will be allocated land this winter; the pain of oppression and exploitation we have suffered for many years will be eliminated forever!" It also said: "Our village has sent three people to the county to study the Land Reform Law. After they return, they can lead us in carrying out land reform."

　　老土地革命区瑞金、平江农民
    致函毛主席拥护土改法
    【本报讯】江西老土地革命区的“红色首都”——瑞金县农民代表李子才、谢耀南等十一人，湖南平江县老土地革命区驷马村农民曾化梅等三十人，最近都曾写信给毛主席，表示热烈拥护土地改革法。
    瑞金县农民代表给毛主席的信上说：“瑞金是红色故都。十六年以前，我们县几十万农民在您领导下打倒了封建势力，分得了田地、房屋，得到了解放。大家都过着民主幸福的生活。自从红军北上抗日以后，国民党匪帮又勾结封建势力——恶霸、地主，惨无人道地乱杀活埋瑞金人民。千万个革命干部与无辜农民惨死在敌人的屠刀下。它们并强横地抢去我们分得的土地、房屋。十多年来，我们忍气吞声，过着牛马不如的奴隶生活。我们相信革命一定会胜利，所以天天盼望着革命胜利早日到来。果然，这个希望究竟在去年八月变成事实了！几十万农民欢欣鼓舞，有的高兴得流出眼泪来。毛主席，现在我们重获解放又已经十个多月了！我们要求彻底翻身。因此我们代表全县农民报告毛主席，我们完全拥护中央人民政府公布的土地改革法。土地是我们的命根子，我们坚决要从地主阶级手中，重新要回我们的土地！”
    平江县驷马村农民的信上说：“看到新的土地改革法后，我们高兴极了。我们今年冬天就可分到土地；多年来所受压迫剥削的痛苦，就要永远解除了！”又说：“我们村里派了三个人到县里学习土地改革法。他们回来后，就可以领导我们进行土地改革。”
