　　The Newspaper is a Collective Organizer
    Stalin
    (The original article was first published in issue 99 of "Pravda" on May 6, 1923, and is now published in Volume 5 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House in 1947. —Editor)
    In his essay "Getting to the Root of the Matter" (Pravda, issue 98), Iengurov discusses the important question of the significance of newspapers for the state and the party. Apparently, to emphasize his ideas, he quoted the organizational report of the Central Committee, which stated: The press "establishes a subtle link between the party and the working class—a link which in its strength is equal to any mass means of communication; the press is the only tool by which the party speaks to the working class every day and every hour." (Note 1)
    However, in his attempt to solve the problem, Iengurov made two mistakes: First, he distorted the meaning of the sentence quoted from the Central Committee report; second, he neglected the extremely important organizational role of the newspaper. I think it is necessary to say a few words about these errors because of the importance of the problem.
    (1) The meaning of the report is not that the role of the party seems to be limited only to the task of speaking to the working class. The party should converse with the working class, not just speak to them. To oppose the formula of "speaking" to the formula of "conversing" means nothing but empty wordplay. In fact, both represent an inseparable whole, both manifested in the continuous interaction between readers and authors, the party and the working class, the state and the working masses. This phenomenon has occurred since the beginning of the existence of mass proletarian parties, even from the time of "Iskra." Iengurov is not thinking correctly: this interaction only began a few years ago after the working class seized power in Russia. The meaning of the sentence quoted from the Central Committee report is not in "speaking," but in the newspaper "establishing a link between the party and the working class," which link "is equal in its strength to any mass means of communication." The meaning of the quoted sentence lies in the organizational significance of the newspaper. Precisely because of this, the newspaper appears in the organizational report of the Central Committee as one of the links between the party and the working class. Iengurov did not understand the quoted sentence and inadvertently distorted its meaning.
    (2) Iengurov emphasizes the agitational and expository role of the newspaper, thinking that this includes all the tasks of the newspaper. He cites some of the drawbacks of our country, while pointing out that the expository work of the newspaper, the agitation carried out by the newspaper, is the "root" of the problem. But it is obvious that, although the agitational role of the newspaper is very important, its organizational role is currently the most urgent element of our construction work. The problem is not only to make the newspaper carry out agitation and exposure, but first of all to make the newspaper have a huge network of workers, office staff, and correspondents from all parts of the country, all industrial locations and agricultural locations, all counties and townships, so that the party's connections can reach all worker areas and peasant areas without exception through the newspaper, and that the interaction between the party and the state on the one hand, and between industrial areas and peasant areas on the other hand, is perfect. If a popular newspaper like "Poor Peasant News" sometimes convenes meetings of representatives of its main offices in various regions of our country to exchange opinions and summarize experiences, and each of these office staff convenes meetings of representatives of its regions, locations, and townships for the same purpose, then this will not only be a major first step in establishing organizational links between the party and the working class, the state and the most remote corners of our country, but also in improving and revitalizing the newspaper itself, and in improving and enlivening all the staff of our newspaper. These representative meetings and discussions, in my opinion, have a much more practical significance than "all-Russian" and other journalist congresses. The newspaper is a collective organizer in the hands of the party and the Soviet regime, the newspaper is a means of establishing links with the working masses of our country and uniting them around the party and the Soviet regime—this is the urgent task of the newspaper now.
    It would not be superfluous to remind readers of a passage in Comrade Lenin's work "What Is To Be Done?" (written in 1901) about the organizational role of the newspaper in our party life.
    "A newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, it is also a collective organizer. In this last respect, it can be compared to scaffolding erected round a building under construction; it marks the contours of the structure, facilitates communication between the builders, helps them to distribute the work and to view the common results achieved by their organized labour. With the aid of the newspaper, and through it, a permanent organisation will naturally take shape that will engage, not only in local activities, but in regular, general work, and will train its members to follow political events carefully, appraise their significance and their effect on the various classes of the population, and work out suitable methods for the revolutionary party to influence these events. The mere technical problem of arranging for a regular supply of material for the newspaper and its proper distribution will make it necessary to create a network of local, united party centres, which maintain constant contact with one another, know the general state of affairs, are accustomed to performing detailed all-Russia functions and to considering all-Russia requirements, and which test their strength in the organisation of various revolutionary actions. This network of centres will form the skeleton of the organisation we need, one that is large enough to embrace the whole country; wide and varied enough to effect a strict and detailed division of labour; loyal enough to be able to conduct its own work steadily under all circumstances, at all 'turns' and in the face of all contingencies; flexible enough to be able, on the one hand, to avoid an open battle against an overwhelmingly strong enemy, when the enemy has concentrated all his forces at one spot, and, on the other, to take advantage of his unwieldiness and to attack him when and where he least expects it." (Note 2).
    Comrade Lenin was talking about the newspaper as a tool for building our party at that time. But there is no reason to doubt that what Lenin said is fully applicable in our current environment of party building and state building.
    Iengurov neglected this important organizational role of the newspaper in his essay. This is his main mistake.
    How could one of the main staff members of our newspaper have neglected this important task? Yesterday a comrade told me: Apparently, in addition to proposing the task of solving the newspaper problem, Iengurov also proposed another incidental task: "To prick someone and make them feel a little uncomfortable." I myself will not affirm this, and I will never deny anyone the right to propose an incidental task for themselves in addition to the direct task. But it cannot be allowed that the incidental task obscures the task of explaining the organizational role of the newspaper in our party building and state building, even for a minute.

### 报纸是集体的组织者
斯大林

　　报纸是集体的组织者
    斯大林
    （原文第一次发表于一九二三年五月六日《真理报》第九九期，现在刊载于苏联国家政治书籍出版局一九四七年印行的《斯大林全集》第五卷。——编者）
    伊恩古洛夫在其论文《追根到底》（《真理报》第九八期）中，讲到了报纸对于国家和党的意义这个重要问题。显然地，为着强调自己的思想，他引证了中央的组织报告，这篇报告说：报刊“建立着党与工人阶级之间的微妙的联系，——这种联系就其力量讲来是相等于任何群众性质的传达机关；报刊是党借以每日每时和工人阶级说话的唯一工具”（注一）。
    但是在其试图解决问题时，伊恩古洛夫却犯了两个错误：第一，他歪曲了从中央报告中所引证的文句的意思；第二，他忽视了报纸的极重要的组织作用。我认为：由于问题的重要性，对这些错误讲一两句话是应该的。
    （一）报告的意思并不是党的作用似乎只局限于与工人阶级说话的任务，党应当与工人阶级交谈，而不仅仅是与他们说话。把“说话”这个公式与“交谈”这个公式对立起来，除了空洞的玩弄文字之外，是不表示什么东西的。实际上两者都表示着不可分割的整体，都表现在读者与作者、党与工人阶级、国家与劳动群众之间的毫不间断的相互作用中。这个现象从群众性的无产阶级政党一开始存在起，甚至从《火星报》时期起，就已经发生了。伊恩古洛夫想得不正确：这种相互作用只是几年以前工人阶级在俄国夺得政权以后才开始的。从中央报告中所引证的文句的意思并不在于“说话”，而是在于报纸“建立着党与工人阶级之间的联系”，这种联系“就其力量讲来是相等于任何群众性质的传达机关”。所引证的文句的意思是在于报纸的组织意义。正因为如此，所以报纸是作为党与工人阶级之间的引带之一而出现于中央的组织报告中。伊恩古洛夫不了解所引证的文句，无意地歪曲了它的意思。
    （二）伊恩古洛夫强调报纸的鼓动的、揭露的作用，以为这把报纸的任务都包括无遗了。他引证了我们国家的一些弊端，同时指出了：报纸的揭露工作，报纸所进行的鼓动，是问题的“根源”。但是显而易见，纵然报纸的鼓动作用非常重要，可是它的组织作用在目前却是我们建设工作的最迫切的要素。问题不仅在于使报纸进行鼓动和揭露，而且首先在于使报纸具有全国各地的、一切工业地点和农业地点的、一切县和乡的工作人员、办事处人员和通讯员的巨大的网，使党的联系通过报纸毫无例外地达到一切工人区域和农民区域，使一方面党与国家、另一方面工业区域和农民区域之间的相互作用十分完满。假如像《贫农报》这样通俗的报纸有时召开自己在我国各个地区的主要办事处人员的代表会议来交换意见和总结经验，而这些办事处人员每一个又为着同一目的召开自己区域、地点和乡的通讯员的代表会议，——那末这就不仅在建立党与工人阶级、国家与我国最僻远角落之间的组织联系方面，而且在改善和振兴报纸本身方面、在改善和振奋我国报纸全部工作人员方面迈进了重大的第一步。这种代表会议与这种讨论性质的会议，据我看来，比起“全俄的”和其他的新闻工作者代表大会具有着更现实得多的意义。报纸是党和苏维埃政权手中的集体组织者，报纸是建立与我国劳动群众的联系并把他们团结在党和苏维埃政权周围的手段，——现在报纸的迫切任务就在于此。
    使读者回忆一下列宁同志所著《从何着手》（一九○一年写成）一文中关于报纸在我们党生活中的组织作用的一段话，将不会是多余的事情。
    “报纸的作用并不只限于传布思想、进行政治教育和吸收政治同盟者。报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且还是集体的组织者。在后一点上，可以把报纸比作一个大木架，它搭在正在修建的房子周围，划出房子的轮廓，便利于各个匠人的交往，帮助他们分配工作和考察有组织的劳动所达到的总成绩。在报纸帮助之下以及和它联系之中，自然而然可以形成一种经常的组织，它不仅从事地方工作，而且还从事正规的一般的工作来教导自己的人员仔细注视政治事变，估计这些事变的意义以及它们对各个居民阶层的影响，制定革命党影响这些事变的适当办法。单是技术的任务——保证正确地把材料供给报纸并正确地推广报纸——就迫使我们建立统一的党的地方办事处网，这些办事处彼此处于活跃的交往中，知道一般事态，习惯于执行全俄工作的零细职务，使用自己的力量去组织某些革命行动。这种办事处网将成为我们所需要的机关的骨干：这种机关是很大的，足以包罗全国；它是很广泛和多方面的，足以进行严格和精细的分工；它是很坚定的，足以在任何情况之下，在任何“转变”和意外之下善于不屈不挠地进行工作；它是很机敏的，足以一方面善于避免与力量占压倒优势的敌人公开作战（当敌人把一切力量集中于一个地点的时候），另一方面则善于利用这个敌人的笨拙，在他们极少料到进攻的地方和时候向他们进攻。”（注二）。
    列宁同志当时讲到了报纸是我们党的建设的工具。但是毫无理由怀疑：列宁所讲的话在我们现在党的建设和国家建设的环境中是完全适用的。
    报纸的这种重要的组织作用，伊恩古洛夫在其论文中却忽视了。他的主要错误就在这里。
    我们报纸的一个主要工作人员怎么竟致忽略了这个重要的任务呢？昨天一个同志向我说：显然伊恩古洛夫除了提出解决报纸问题的任务之外，还提出了另一个附带的任务：“刺人一下，使人感到一点儿不舒服”。我自己不来肯定这一点，而且决不否认任何人除了直接任务之外还有给自己提出附带任务的权利。但是不能容许附带的任务把阐明报纸在我们党的建设与国家建设方面的组织作用这一任务掩盖起来，即使是一分钟也罢。
