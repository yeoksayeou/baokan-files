　　Soldiers and Civilians Rush to Repair Dikes Along the Jingjiang and Han Rivers
    Jingzhou and Other Counties are Safe Again

    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th] Due to continuous heavy rains and rapidly rising water levels, the perilous Jingjiang Dike and the Han River main dike have been stabilized thanks to the joint efforts of local military, government, and civilians. The Jingjiang Dike is one of the main dikes along the Yangtze River, and it is vital to the safety of the people in nine counties including Jingzhou, Jianli, and Mianyang along the Yangtze River. During this rise in the Yangtze River's water level, breaches and collapses occurred in sections of the dike from Shashi to Jiangling Jiangshen Temple, around the Songzi kilometer marker, and in the Shunhe Dike in Gong'an County. Local people worked hard to repair the damage, and nearby troops, government cadres, and students rushed to help after the dangers occurred. They have built waterproof fortifications and repaired the protective embankments outside the main dike. Many dangerous sections have also been surrounded with earthen walls, and projects such as filling breaches with burlap sacks of soil and creating immersion platforms at the base of the inner slopes have been completed. The perilous situation of the river dike has now stabilized.

    The Han River also experienced high water levels due to rain upstream. At the Huayan Temple section of the Han River main dike in Hanchuan area, which had breached, the disaster area was reduced under the all-out rescue effort of the second line of defense organized by the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters. When the water level in the Yuekou section of the Han River rose and sections of the dike were breached by the Han River, a unit of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army rushed to the rescue in combat readiness. After marching fifty *li* in the rain that night, the troops immediately began carrying earth and filling grass bags in the storm without rest. Thanks to the efforts of the commanders and fighters, hundreds of thousands of people along the river were spared from the flood.

　　军民抢修荆江汉水堤防
    荆州等县转危为安
    【新华社汉口十八日电】因连日大雨，水位猛涨而呈险象之荆江大堤和汉水干堤在当地军政民协力抢护下，现已转危为安。荆江大堤，为长江干堤之一，关系长江沿岸荆州、监利、沔阳等九县人民的安危。此次长江水位上涨时，沙市至江陵江神庙段、松滋公里碑一带及公安县顺河大堤等处，均发生漏洞、溃口现象。当地人民奋力抢护与附近驻军、机关干部、学生于险象发生后赶往抢护，已赶筑了防水堡垒和抢修了干堤外之保障垸，不少险工亦已筑土围，以麻袋土填塞决口及于内坡脚作压浸台等工程。现江堤险象已转向稳定。
    汉水亦因上游下雨而水位高涨。汉川地区决口之华严寺汉水干堤，在湖北省防汛指挥部全力抢救第二道防线下，可使受灾范围缩小。汉水岳口段水位上涨，若干堤防为汉水冲决时，人民解放军第四野战军某部即以战斗姿态赶往抢险。部队于当夜冒雨行军五十里后毫未休息就在暴风雨中抬土、装草包。在指战员们努力下，沿岸数十万人民免于水灾。
