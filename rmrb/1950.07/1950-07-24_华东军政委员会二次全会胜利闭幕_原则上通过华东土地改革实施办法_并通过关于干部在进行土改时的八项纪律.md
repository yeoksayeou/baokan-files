Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: The Second Plenary Session of the East China Military and Political Committee, lasting nine days, successfully concluded on the 22nd.

The meeting unanimously endorsed the report by Committee Member Pan Hannian on conveying the resolutions and spirit of the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and unanimously resolved to resolutely implement all reports and resolutions in practical work.

The meeting unanimously approved Chairman Rao Shushi's report "Striving to Complete Land Reform in East China," Vice Chairman Zeng Shan's report on the financial and economic work of East China, and Commander Chen Yi's report on political and military affairs, and unanimously resolved to resolutely strive to complete land reform in East China, to strive for a better financial and economic situation, and to liberate Taiwan.

The meeting unanimously approved in principle the "East China Land Reform Implementation Measures," and unanimously adopted the "Eight Disciplines Regarding Cadres During Land Reform Work," as well as the "Circular Telegram to the People of the Whole Country Opposing U.S. Imperialist Armed Intervention in Taiwan and Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement." (The full text of the circular telegram is on the second page.)

This meeting focused on land reform as its central topic. Chairman Rao Shushi delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Striving to Complete Land Reform in East China." In this report, Chairman Rao gave detailed explanations and instructions on the general plan for land reform in East China, the specific implementation measures for land reform in East China, and issues such as land reform policies, guidelines, and leadership. Chairman Rao said: In the East China region, areas that have basically completed or have previously carried out land reform have a rural population of approximately 45 million; new areas where land reform has not been carried out have a rural population of approximately 70 million. In the year or more since liberation, through mass movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, rent reduction, reasonable burden, and production for disaster relief, peasant associations have been established in most areas. Membership has reached 11 million, including approximately 800,000 militiamen, and people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences at the county, district, and township levels have been generally convened. Preliminary democratic reforms have been carried out in rural governments in many places. It is estimated that land reform will be implemented in areas with a rural population of approximately 50 million in East China this winter; in addition, in areas with a rural population of approximately 20 million, land reform conditions are not yet mature, and preparations for land reform conditions will continue this winter and next spring, so as to carry out land reform after the autumn of 1951. Chairman Rao said: As long as we move forward steadily and avoid detours, it is possible to basically complete land reform in the East China region within two years.

The heads of various committees, departments, and bureaus of the East China Military and Political Committee made work reports at the meeting. Committee members Liu Minsheng, Bao Dasan, Wu YunChu, Rong Desheng, Ding ChaoWu, Wang Yunsheng, Hu Juewen, and attendees Luo Guangwen, Liu Jingji, Ren Hongjun, and others, totaling forty people, spoke at the general assembly one after another, unanimously expressing their firm support for the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and actively supporting peasants in carrying out land reform work.

On the last day of the meeting, Chairman Rao Shushi, based on the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central People's Government's report on land reform issues, succinctly answered various questions raised in the discussion on land reform issues. The meeting concluded successfully after passing various resolutions and a closing speech by Vice Chairman Ma Yinchu.

　　华东军政委员会二次全会胜利闭幕
    原则上通过华东土地改革实施办法
    并通过关于干部在进行土改时的八项纪律
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东军政委员会第二次全体委员会议历时九天，已于二十二日胜利闭幕。
    会议全体一致拥护潘汉年委员关于中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第二次会议的决议与精神的传达报告，并一致决议坚决把各项报告和决议贯彻到实际工作中去。
    会议一致同意饶漱石主席“为完成华东土地改革而奋斗”的报告、曾山副主席关于华东财政经济工作的报告、陈毅司令员关于政治军事的报告，并一致决议为完成华东土地改革、为争取财政经济情况更加好转、及为解放台湾而坚决奋斗。
    会议全体一致在原则上通过“华东土地改革实施办法”，并一致通过“关于干部在进行土地改革工作时的八项纪律”，以及“为反对美帝国主义武装干涉台湾暨拥护周外长声明致全国人民的通电”。（通电全文见第二版）
    这次会议以土地改革为中心议题。饶漱石主席在会上作了题为“为完成华东土地改革而奋斗”的报告。饶主席在这一报告中，对于华东土地改革的大体计划、华东土地改革具体实施办法以及关于土地改革的政策、方针、领导等问题，均作了详尽的解释和说明。饶主席说：华东地区已经基本完成或曾经进行过土地改革的地区，约有农业人口四千五百万；没有进行土地改革的新区，约有农业人口七千余万。在解放以来一年多时间内，经过剿匪、反对恶霸、减租、合理负担及生产救灾等群众运动，大多数地区已建立了农民协会。会员已达一千一百万，其中包括民兵约共八十万，并普遍召集了县区乡三级的人民代表会议和农民代表会议。许多地方的乡村政权已进行了初步的民主改造。预计今年冬季华东实行土地改革的约有五千万农业人口的地区；另有约二千余万农业人口的地区，因土地改革条件尚未成熟，今冬明春将继续准备土地改革的条件，以便在一九五一年秋后进行土地改革。饶主席说：只要我们稳步前进，少走弯路，在两年内基本完成华东地区的土地改革是可以做到的。
    华东军政委员会各委、部、局的负责人曾在会上作了工作报告。委员刘民生、包达三、吴蕴初、荣德生、丁超五、王芸生、胡厥文，列席人士罗广文、刘靖基、任鸿隽等共四十人，先后在大会发言，一致表示坚决拥护中华人民共和国土地改革法，积极支持农民实行土地改革工作。
    会议最后一天由饶漱石主席根据中华人民共和国土地改革法及中央人民政府刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，扼要地解答了关于土改问题讨论中所提出的各项问题。会议在通过各项决议并由马寅初副主席致闭幕词后，胜利结束。
