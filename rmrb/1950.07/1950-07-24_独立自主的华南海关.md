　　The Independent and Autonomous South China Customs
    Our Special Correspondent Gu Weijin
    I. The People Mastered Their Own Customs
    The history of the South China Customs is a history of imperialist aggression. Since the Opium War in 1842, imperialists, using their armed forces and enslaving treaties, successively forced the opening of the Guangzhou Customs, Shantou Customs, Beihai Customs, Longzhou Customs, Wuzhou Customs, and Jiangmen Customs to conduct foreign trade. They stipulated extremely low tariffs or even tax-free imports, while absorbing raw materials at low prices. At the same time, they also controlled the management of customs and the revenue and expenditure of tariffs. This kind of economic aggression by imperialists seriously damaged the industrial and agricultural production of South China.
    The great victory of the Chinese People's War of Liberation ended the unequal and un-autonomous state caused by imperialists' control of the South China Customs for more than a hundred years, and recovered the independent sovereignty in tariff policy and the autonomy in managing customs affairs. The Guangzhou Military Control Commission, based on the principle of "developing production and prospering the economy," formulated the "Provisional Import and Export Tariff of the South China Region." From then on, the South China Customs became a people's customs that protects production, manages import and export, and serves the economic construction of the motherland.
    This is an epoch-making change in the South China Customs. But this change is only a beginning; to push it further forward, that is to say, to change the old customs, which had long been controlled by imperialists and served imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, into a new customs that meets the needs of the new situation and new tasks, it is necessary to implement necessary reforms and new construction work in various aspects in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    II. Imperialists Encourage and Protect Smuggling
    Since the liberation of South China, the work of reforming the old customs and building the new customs is progressing. The progress of this work is inseparable from the struggle against imperialism.
    The most obvious is the struggle between smuggling and anti-smuggling. The coastline of South China is long, the harbors and rivers are intricate, the land is undulating with hills, and it is close to Hong Kong and Macau. After the Chinese people mastered the autonomy of the South China Customs, imperialists, in order to continue to maintain the dumping of goods in South China, used the special geographical environment of South China to carry out smuggling. Here, on the one hand, imperialists encourage and protect smuggling. For example, in Macau, generally larger smugglers (which are a combination of special agents, hooligans, and bandits), with the assistance of imperialists, conduct organized and planned smuggling activities. They have smuggling agencies, equipped with fast motorboats and weapons. When smuggled goods are transported from Macau's territorial waters to China's territorial waters, and it is found that there are customs patrol boats tracking and monitoring, Portuguese warships will follow to obstruct them. This belongs to large-scale smuggling. On the other hand, there is small-scale, sporadic smuggling, but the number of people is large and it is carried out continuously. In the area of ​​the branch customs of the Gongbei Port in the border area between Macau and Zhongshan County, about 1,000 bicycles are smuggled every day, and each bicycle can smuggle about five or six times a day. On a section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, the number of smuggled goods reaches up to 10,000 people per day. Smuggling tricks are endless, foreign currency, gold, and opium are hidden in water pens or bicycle frame tubes, foreign cigarettes and foreign groceries are hidden at the bottom of the fecal boats, edible salt is disguised as fertilizer, and kerosene barrels are filled with rice hidden in the water at the bottom of the boats, and so on. This gives great difficulties to the customs' anti-smuggling work. However, the People's Customs, in order to protect South China from imperialist economic aggression, insists on fighting against smuggling. The customs strengthen investigation and research, grasp the situation, and carry out anti-smuggling work more foreseeably, flexibly, with emphasis, and strategically, and reward anti-smuggling according to the "Provisional Measures for Anti-Smuggling Rewards in the South China Region." In this way, in places where anti-smuggling capabilities are within reach, smuggling has begun to be dealt with a certain blow. According to statistics from Guangzhou Customs from January to May alone, more than a thousand cases of smuggled goods were seized (including gold, silver, foreign currency, rice, salt and other prohibited items), and the value of the smuggled goods amounted to more than 8 billion RMB.
    III. Anything Unreasonable Must Be Changed
    The customs business, which has long been controlled by imperialists, has many extremely unreasonable phenomena. It takes twelve passing processes for goods to be declared and cleared, which considerably delays the transfer time of the goods. At the same time, if the person declaring the goods does not bribe the customs officer, the customs officer will delay the passing time even longer, or arbitrarily find fault with the goods, causing the merchant to suffer unexpected losses. Now, the procedures for declaring and clearing goods are simplified, that is, the internal connection of this work is strengthened, so that the work progresses scientifically and reasonably. In this way, the twelve passing processes of declaring and clearing goods in the past are reduced to four processes: checking documents, inspection, valuation, and tax calculation. The work of declaring and clearing goods, which used to take an average of five or six hours, can now be completed in three or four hours. Improving the valuation work is also an extremely important thing. In the past, the valuation of each customs was inconsistent, and some even changed several times a day; after the customs officers received bribes, they could arbitrarily lower the valuation. This is a great obstacle to the implementation of the customs tax policy and the protection of the interests of importers and exporters. Now, in response to these malpractices, valuation methods are formulated and unified leadership is implemented: in principle, it is stipulated that the change in valuation must be based on the change in the price of the main import and export goods in a certain period. At the same time, if there are no instructions from the superiors, the subordinates cannot change it casually. Simplifying the procedures for declaring and clearing goods and improving the valuation work are the most important work in improving customs operations. The development of this work will greatly promote the development of import and export trade.
    IV. Independent and Autonomous Tariff Policy
    Abolishing the tariff policy that adapts to imperialist economic aggression and formulating a new tariff policy, that is, levying tariffs based on the degree to which the output and input of commodities are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, is the most important part of the entire reform work of the customs. The implementation of this reform work has already greatly increased the customs revenue after liberation compared with the customs revenue before liberation. Taking the tax revenue of the three prosperous months before liberation, namely July, August, and September of last year, as an example, the average tax revenue of these three prosperous months at that time was 154,123 dan (rice, the same below). After liberation, namely in December of last year, the tax revenue reached 249,139.66 dan, an increase of 61.68%. By May of this year, the tax revenue of the People's Customs was 357,634.42 dan, an increase of 31.81%.
    V. Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Secretarial Style
    Under the long-term rule and influence of imperialists, customs personnel have serious and corrupt styles. For example, some are corrupt and engage in malfeasance; some have an arrogant attitude and are divorced from the masses; some are perfunctory in their work and muddle along. These are the biggest obstacles to the establishment of the People's Customs. Therefore, after the South China Customs Department took over the customs, it first started from the Guangzhou Customs to transform the ideological style of the customs personnel. After two study teams, a three-anti movement against corruption, waste, and secretarial style (that is, bureaucracy) was universally launched. This work, which has great educational significance, has gradually improved the ideological consciousness of customs staff. Many customs personnel not only consciously confessed the corruption before liberation (according to the statistics that have been confessed, the embezzled money is equivalent to more than 3,000 taels of gold), but also consciously handed over the embezzled money after liberation (nearly 30 million RMB); not only determined to show that they will not be corrupt in the future, but also guaranteed to report others' corruption. In the work, customs personnel have begun to take practical actions to correct the waste phenomenon in the past, such as saving water, electricity, vehicle and ship fuel, and office stationery. This saving fee is equivalent to two-thirds of the expenditure during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The secretarial style has also been gradually corrected. Internal personnel reduced the attendants in the public affairs room (in the past, they worked in the same room, and one person was required to specialize in delivering documents, which was unnecessary), and external personnel changed their arrogant attitude towards people. At present, the South China Customs Department is promoting the experience of the Guangzhou Customs "Three-Anti" movement to various customs.
    VI. Rectify the Organization, Improve Leadership, Adjust Wages
    In the past, in order to facilitate economic aggression, imperialists set up a total of 56 customs of various sizes in South China, forming a forest of customs, with many names and a huge organization. Now, the South China Customs Department, according to the needs of foreign trade, the amount of import and export goods, and the number of import and export passengers, has drafted a plan for setting up customs, merging and abolishing unnecessary customs, leaving 17 customs of various sizes. In this way, it is convenient to centralize leadership and save manpower and financial resources. The phenomenon of overstaffing is the biggest feature of the old customs (in the past, it was mostly three people doing the work of five people). After the new establishment of "determining personnel, determining quantity, and determining quota" in March, the employee's salary can save 5,210 city dan, and other recurring expenses can save 15,926 city dan. These two saving fees account for 55% of the April budget. The centralization system of the Tax Department once caused "self-esteem", only knowing how to issue orders, not understanding the situation below, and the lower level only knowing how to obey orders, not knowing why to do so. Now, the centralization system has been changed to a responsibility system at all levels, promoting democracy and improving everyone's work enthusiasm and responsibility. The adjustment of wages has corrected the unreasonable wage system in the past. The adjustment of wages is carried out according to the current position, business experience, technical level, and work attitude. In this way, it broke the semi-colonial wage system in the past, such as equal pay for different work for Chinese and foreigners, administration being higher than technology, and promotion according to loyalty to imperialism.
    VII. Thoroughly Reforming Customs Work Still Requires Effort
    All reform work to get rid of the influence and harm of imperialism is progressing victoriously under the efforts of all customs personnel. Naturally, the imperialists in nearby Hong Kong and Macau will not be reconciled to this. They once combined with special agents to carry out various rumors and sabotage, and once used high salaries to buy off customs personnel. However, this kind of destructive activity by imperialists cannot keep up with the improvement of the political awareness of customs personnel under the education of the People's Customs, especially the liberation of Hainan Island, which strengthened the customs personnel's confidence in victory and recognized that the only way out in the future is to serve in the People's Customs.
    However, this does not mean that the work of reforming the old customs and building the new customs will be smooth sailing from now on. According to the current situation of work progress, there are still many problems, such as smuggling, corruption, waste, and bureaucratic style, which are still relatively serious in some places. Reforming the old customs and building the new customs still requires continuing to carry out various direct and indirect struggles with imperialists. As the best weapon for this struggle, it is necessary to strengthen the education of customs personnel in the future, improve their political awareness, overcome the bureaucratic style, and establish the concept and style of serving the people. And strengthen the unity between cadres and original customs personnel, humbly learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, in order to give play to the role of unity and victory. In this way, the People's Customs will surely stand on the front line of safeguarding the economic construction of the new China with a strong and impregnable posture.

　　独立自主的华南海关
    本报特派记者  古维进
    一、人民掌握了自己的海关
    华南海关史是一部帝国主义侵略史。自一八四二年鸦片战争以来，帝国主义者用其武装力量及奴役式的条约，先后强迫开放广州关、汕头关、北海关、龙州关、梧州关、江门关，进行对外贸易。并规定以极低的关税甚至免税输入商品，以廉价吸收原料。同时他们还掌握了海关管理和关税收支大权。帝国主义者此种经济侵略，严重地破坏了华南的工业和农业生产。
    中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，结束了一百多年来帝国主义者掌握华南海关所造成的各种不平等与不自主的状态，收回了在关税政策方面的独立主权及管理海关事业的自主权。广州军管会本着“发展生产，繁荣经济”的原则，制定了“华南区海关暂行进出口税则”。从此，华南海关便成为保护生产，管理进出口，为祖国经济建设服务的人民的海关了。
    这是华南海关一个划时代的大变化。但是这个变化仅仅是一个开始；要想把它往前推进一步，即是说要把曾经长期掌握在帝国主义手中、为帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义服务的旧海关，改变成适应新形势新任务需要的新海关，还必须要有计划有步骤地实行各方面必要的改革和新的建设工作。
    二、帝国主义者鼓励与保护走私
    华南解放以来，这一个改革旧海关、建设新海关的工作正在进展。这个工作的进展，和对帝国主义的斗争是不可分离的。
    最明显的是走私和缉私的斗争。华南海岸线漫长，港湾河流错综复杂，陆地丘陵起伏，又接近香港和澳门。当中国人民掌握了华南海关自主权后，帝国主义者为继续维持对华南的商品倾销，便利用华南特殊的地理环境进行走私。这里，一方面是帝国主义者鼓励与保护走私。比如在澳门，一般较大的私枭（这是特务、流氓、土匪的结合体），在帝国主义者协助下，有组织有计划地进行走私活动。他们设有走私机关，备有快速汽船和武器。当私货从澳门领海运到中国领海，发现有海关的巡艇追踪监视时，葡舰即尾随阻挠。这是属于大批的走私。另一方面，是小批的、零星的走私，但是，人数众多并且不间断地进行着。澳门在中山县交界的地方关闸的支关一带，每天就约有一千架自行车走私，每架自行车一天能走私约五、六次。在广（州）深（圳）铁路的一段，每日走私的最多达万人以上。走私的花样百出，水笔内或自行车架筒内，匿藏外币、黄金及烟土，粪船夹底藏洋烟及洋杂货，食盐伪装肥田粉，煤油桶装米藏在船底水中等等。这给予海关缉私工作以很大的困难。但是，人民海关为保护华南不受帝国主义经济侵略，坚持与走私作斗争。各关加强调查研究，掌握情况，比较有预见地、机动灵活地、有重点、有策略地进行缉私工作，并根据“华南区海关缉私提奖暂行办法”奖励缉私。这样，在缉私能力所及的地方，已开始给予走私以一定的打击。仅据广州海关一月至五月统计，缉获私货案件达千余宗（包括黄金、白银、外币、米、盐及其他违禁品），私货价值合人民币八十亿元以上。
    三、不合理的就要改变
    被帝国主义长期掌握的海关业务，存在着许多极不合理的现象。货物报关结关，需要经过十二个传递过程，相当拖延货物的转运时间。同时，报关的人如果不贿赂关员，关员还要把传递的时间拖得更长，或任意在货物上面找毛病，使客商遭受意外的损失。现在实行简化报关结关的手续，即加强这一工作的内部联系，使工作进展科学合理。这样便将过去报关结关的十二个传递过程，减缩为对单、查验、估价、计税四个过程。过去平均须要五六小时才能干完的报关结关工作，现在三四小时就能干完。改善估价工作，也是一件极其重要的事情。过去各关估价高低不一，有的甚至一天数变；关员受贿后，可以随意降低估价。这对于贯彻海关税收政策及保障出进口商人的利益，都是很大的阻碍。现在针对这些流弊，拟定估价办法和实行统一领导：原则上规定估价的变换，必须根据一定时期的主要出进口货物价格的变换。同时，如果没有上级指示，下面不能随便变换。简化报关结关手续及改善估价工作，是改进海关业务中最主要的工作。这个工作的开展，将大大促进出进口贸易的开展。
    四、独立自主的关税政策
    废除适应帝国主义者经济侵略的关税政策，制定新的关税政策，即根据商品输出输入有利于国计民生程度来征收关税，是海关全部改革工作中最重要的一环。这个改革工作的实施，已经使解放后的海关税收较之解放前的海关税收大有增加。以解放前即去年七、八、九三个旺月的税收为例，当时这三个旺月的平均税收为一五四、一二三担（大米、下同），解放后即去年十二月的税收即达到二四九、一三九·六六担，增加了百分之六一·六八，到了今年五月，人民海关的税收为三五七、六三四·四二担，增加了百分之三一·八一。
    五、反贪污、反浪费、反师爷作风
    在帝国主义者长期统治和影响下，海关人员严重地存在着恶劣腐败的作风。如有的贪污腐化，营私舞弊；有的态度傲慢，脱离群众；有的工作敷衍，得过且过。这些，都是建立人民海关的最大障碍。因此，华南海关处接管海关后，首先从广州海关改造海关人员的思想作风作起，经过两次学习队学习后，普遍展开了反贪污、反浪费、反师爷作风（即官僚主义）的三反运动。这个具有重大教育意义的工作，已经逐渐提高海关工作人员的思想觉悟。许多海关人员不仅自觉地坦白解放前的贪污（据已经坦白出来的统计，贪污赃款合黄金三千余两），还自觉地交出解放后的贪污赃款（将近人民币三千万元）；不仅决心表示自己今后不贪污，还保证检举别人的贪污行为。在工作中，海关人员已开始以实际行动纠正过去的浪费现象，如节约水、电、车船燃料及办公文具等。这一笔节约费，约相当于国民党反动统治时代开支的三分之二。师爷作风也已逐渐纠正。内部人员减去公事房的侍候人（过去同一室办公，须一人专侍候传递公文，这是不必要的），外部人员改变对人的傲慢态度。目前华南海关处正以广州海关“三反”运动的经验向各关推广。
    六、整顿机构，改善领导，调整工薪
    过去帝国主义者为了便于经济侵略，在华南设关大小共五十六个，形成关所林立，名目繁多，机构庞大。现在华南海关处根据对外贸易的需要，出进口货物的多少，和出进口旅客的众寡等条件，拟出设关方案，把不必要的关所加以合并与撤消，剩下大小关所十七个。这样，既便于集中领导，又节省人力、财力。人浮于事的现象，是旧海关的最大特色（过去大都是三个人的工作五个人干），三月份进行“定员定量定额”的新编制后，员工资薪可节省五、二一○市担，其他经常费可节省一五、九二六市担。这两笔节省费占四月份预算的百分之五十五。税务司的集权制，曾经造成“唯我独尊”，只知发号施令，不了解下面情况，下面只知唯命是从，不知为什么要这样干。现在把集权制改成各级负责制，发扬了民主，提高了大家的工作积极性与责任心。调整工薪的进行，纠正了过去不合理的工薪制。调整工薪是按照现在职位、业务经验、技术水平、工作态度等原则进行的。这样，便打破了过去华洋人同工不同酬、行政高于技术、提升按照对帝国主义的忠实程度等半殖民地的工薪制。
    七、彻底改革海关工作还须努一把力
    一切摆脱帝国主义的影响和毒害的改革工作，正在全体海关人员努力下胜利进展着。自然，近在咫尺的港澳帝国主义者是不会就此甘心的。他们曾经结合特务进行各种造谣破坏，曾经以高薪收买海关人员。但是帝国主义者此种破坏活动，远赶不上在人民海关教育下海关人员政治觉悟的提高，特别是海南岛的解放，坚定了海关人员的胜利信心，认识了今后的出路唯有在人民海关服务。
    但是，这并不等于改革旧海关、建设新海关的工作，从此一帆风顺。根据目前工作进展的情况看来，存在的问题尚多，如走私、贪污、浪费、官僚主义作风等，在有些地方仍然比较严重。改革旧海关、建设新海关还需要继续和帝国主义者进行直接的间接的各种各样的斗争。作为这个斗争的最好武器，就是今后加强海关人员的教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，克服官僚主义的作风，树立为人民服务的观念和作风。并加强干部与原海关人员的团结，互相虚心学习，取长补短，以发挥团结制胜的作用。这样，人民海关必将以坚强的无懈可击的姿态，站在保卫新中国经济建设的最前线。
