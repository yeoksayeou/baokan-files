Xinhua News Agency, 13th: 44 percent of the 260,000 workers in Wuhan have joined trade union organizations. By the end of June, 22 industrial trade unions and 7 industrial trade union preparatory committees had been established in the city, along with grass-roots trade unions in more than 400 production units. The grass-roots trade unions affiliated with the Educational Workers' Union have been universally established in major and secondary schools, with members accounting for more than 90 percent of all teachers and staff. The grass-roots trade unions for shop assistants, handicraft workers, and transport workers have also been largely established. Currently, the organizational work of the Wuhan trade unions has entered the stage of improving and consolidating grass-roots organizations, in addition to continuing to organize workers who have not yet been organized.

In terms of the workers' movement, leading cadres at all levels of trade unions have begun to clarify and implement the policy that "trade union work must be oriented towards production." In September of last year and February of this year, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held two trade union work conferences, conveying to trade union cadres throughout the city the various resolutions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on trade union work, criticizing and correcting the simplistic welfare viewpoint held by some cadres who believed that production was an administrative matter and that trade unions should only engage in workers' welfare, and implementing the policy that trade union work should be oriented towards production.

After this, trade union work became active. In state-owned factories, trade unions cooperated with the administration to organize workers' representative meetings and factory management committees; in private factories and shops, they took the initiative to unite with capitalists to establish labor-capital consultation committees and sign collective labor-capital contracts or temporary agreements. As of now, 30 units in state-owned enterprises throughout the city have organized employee representative meetings and factory management committees; labor-capital consultation meetings have been established in 23 industries in private enterprises. Forty-three grass-roots trade unions have assisted the administration or capitalists in formulating production plans, 35 grass-roots trade unions have organized production competitions, and some factories have promoted rationalization proposals. After the Hankou Electrical Equipment Factory launched a production competition, it continuously created new records, and its current output is 50 percent higher on average than before liberation. In the past, the production of A-grade batteries required some American manganese powder, but now all domestically produced manganese powder is used, and the quality remains at the original level.

Since the spring of this year, a large-scale amateur learning movement focusing on culture has been launched throughout the city. As of the end of May, there were 103 spare-time schools in the city, with more than 13,500 students. An even greater number of workers participated in small night schools and study groups. Over the past year, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions of various systems have trained a large number of worker cadres through the Central China Workers' School and short-term training courses. Currently, there are more than 2,600 worker cadres who participate in grass-roots trade union work without leaving production.

In the past, the main shortcomings of the Wuhan trade union work were that the leadership of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions only called for being oriented towards production, but did not deeply and specifically lead the production movement; in individual state-owned enterprises, there were phenomena where trade unions and workers, when participating in democratic management, did not proceed from the development of production and one-sidedly emphasized democracy and workers' welfare; in private enterprises, some trade unions made unprincipled concessions to the excessive demands of some workers. These biases have been criticized at the Municipal Workers' Congress held earlier this month, and methods to overcome them have been pointed out.

### 武汉全市二十六万工人百分之四十四参加工会

　　武汉全市二十六万工人百分之四十四参加工会
    【新华社十三日讯】武汉市二十六万工人中已有百分之四十四参加了工会组织。迄六月底止，全市已建立了二十二个产业工会和七个产业工会筹委会，四百多个生产单位的基层工会。教育工作者工会所属各基层工会，已在各大、中、小学中普遍建立，会员占全体教职员、工人的百分之九十以上。其他各店员、手工业工人、运输工人的基层工会也已大部成立。现武汉市工会的组织工作除继续组织尚未组织起来的工人以外，已进入健全和巩固基层组织的阶段。
    在工人运动方面，各级工会领导干部已开始明确并执行了“工会工作必须面向生产”的方针。去年九月和今年二月，市总工会筹委会曾召开了两次工会工作会议，向全市工会干部传达了全国总工会关于工会工作的各项决议，批评和纠正了部分干部中认为生产是行政上的事，工会只搞工人福利的单纯福利观点，贯彻了工会工作面向生产的方针。
    在这以后，工会工作即活跃起来。在公营工厂中，工会配合行政组织工人代表会和工厂管理委员会；在私营工厂和商店中，主动团结资方成立劳资协商委员会，签订劳资集体合同或临时协议。至目前为止，全市公营企业中已有三十个单位组织了职工代表会和工厂管理委员会；私营企业中有二十三个行业建立了劳资协商会议。有四十三个基层工会协助行政或资方订了生产计划，三十五个基层工会组织了生产竞赛，部分工厂推行了合理化建议。汉口电工器材厂展开生产竞赛运动后，不断创造了新纪录，目前产量平均较解放前提高百分之五十。过去制甲电池需用一部分美国锰粉，现在全用国产锰粉，质量仍保持原来水平。
    自今年春开始，全市大规模地开展了以文化为主的业余学习运动。至五月底止，全市共有业余学校一百零三个，学员一万三千五百余人，参加小型夜校和学习小组学习的工人为数更多。一年来，市总工会筹委会和各系统工会，曾通过华中工人学校和短期训练班，培养训练了大批工人干部。目前不脱离生产而参加基层工会工作的工人干部有二千六百余人。
    过去武汉市工会工作的主要缺点是总工会筹委会领导方面只是号召面向生产，而没有深入地、具体地去领导生产运动；在个别公营企业中，工会和工人参加民主管理时，有不从发展生产出发、片面地强调民主和工人福利的现象；在私营企业中，有的工会则对部分工人的过高要求作了无原则的迁就。这些偏向在本月初召开的全市工人代表大会中已加以批判，并指出了克服办法。
