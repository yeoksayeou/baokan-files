　　Preservation of Buildings with Revolutionary Historical Significance
    Yan'an Establishes Construction Committee
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 18th】 The Yan'an Regional People's Commissioner's Office of Shaanxi Province established the Yan'an Construction Committee last month to preserve buildings in Yan'an that have revolutionary historical significance. Until March 1947, Yan'an was the location of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which led the Chinese people in their struggle for liberation. However, many buildings with revolutionary historical significance were destroyed by the Hu Zongnan bandit gang, which once occupied the area. The Yan'an Construction Committee has decided to repair the Yangjialing Central Committee Auditorium, the General Office, and the residences of Chairman Mao in Zaoyuan and Wangjiaping, protect the tombs of the "April 8th" martyrs, and establish the Yan'an Library.

    延安设修建委员会
    【新华社西安十八日电】陕西省延安分区人民专员公署为保存延安有革命历史意义的建筑，已于上月成立延安修建委员会。迄至一九四七年三月，延安曾为领导中国人民进行解放斗争的中国共产党中央所在地。但许多有革命历史意义的建筑物都被曾一度侵占该地的胡宗南匪帮破坏。延安修建委员会已确定了修建杨家岭中共中央大礼堂、办公厅及毛主席在枣园、王家坪住过的房屋，保护“四八”烈士墓和建立延安图书馆。
