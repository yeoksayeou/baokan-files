　　Several Stages of Development of Soviet Cooperatives
    Su Jing
    The development of Soviet cooperatives has seven stages:

    The first stage: before the establishment of the Soviet regime. The first cooperative in Russia was established in 1864. Thirty-four years later, the Central Union of Cooperatives was established. Before the revolution, the scale of Russian cooperatives was small, and only 14 provinces out of 54 had established cooperatives. At that time, cooperatives were still only a link in the capitalist economic operation. Capitalists controlled more than 50% of the shares in the cooperative's capital and formulated a system in which the number of shares determined the voting rights, which facilitated the capitalists' control of cooperative operations. The owners of the cooperatives at that time were either big merchants or big business owners, who did whatever they wanted. Such cooperatives could not unite into an independent system, but became agents of capitalists and served capitalism.

    The second stage: 1918-1922. After the October Revolution, cooperatives developed in the process of seizing power and defeating foreign encirclement. At that time, there was no trade or commercial relationship. The cooperative itself was a commodity distribution agency. The state implemented a strict wartime system, stipulating that commodities should be distributed to residents and the army through cooperatives. Therefore, all citizens had to join cooperatives. The cooperative stipulated share quotas, and each member had to pay. This period can be called the distribution stage. The cooperative organization had only two levels: the lower level and the central level, without an intermediate layer in provinces and regions. Some of the work of the grassroots cooperatives was directly led by the central government. Members purchased commodities from cooperatives with certificates, which had to be carefully calculated, so cooperatives employed many people.

    The third stage: the end of 1922. The war ended, and the Soviet Union shifted from the wartime communist system to the New Economic Policy period, opening up private trade and allowing the development of private capitalism. Therefore, the cooperative's business embarked on a new path; more specifically, the cooperative itself needed to be reorganized, and various cooperative regulations and systems needed to be formulated.

    According to the new organizational system, in addition to the Central Union of Cooperatives, there were also provincial federations like those in China today and a county cooperative in each county, with the county as the central link in urban-rural trade, conducting trade in both urban and rural areas. At that time, there were few cooperatives, and there were not many stalls and shops attached to the cooperatives. Most of the commercial activities belonged to private trade. In 1922, the trade volume of the state and cooperatives was less than 20% of the total trade volume; private merchants accounted for more than 80%. As the state and cooperative businesses gradually squeezed out private merchants, a dramatic change occurred in the two years from 1923 to 1925, resulting in the opposite phenomenon that the trade of the state and cooperatives accounted for 80%, while private merchants accounted for only 20%. By the end of 1928, private merchants had almost disappeared.

    During this period, the cooperative put forward two slogans: (1) Learn business. (2) Who will defeat whom. That is to say, cooperatives must defeat private merchants in the market. The state also gave cooperatives various conveniences and preferential treatments, such as: (1) Cooperatives paid half the tax of private businesses; (2) Railway freight was also half that of private merchants; (3) The state leased or allocated twice as many houses to cooperatives as to private individuals; (4) The interest on bank loans to cooperatives was lower than that to private merchants, and the loan period of banks to cooperatives was also longer than that of private capital.

    At that time, the main tasks of the cooperative were three: First, to implement economic accounting to obtain profits. In other words, the cooperative must obtain profits in business operations to accumulate a large amount of funds. If the cooperative lost money, it would have to close down. Second, to absorb more people to participate in cooperatives. Third, to seek benefits for members as much as possible so that they would be willing to join cooperatives. These benefits can be divided into two aspects: First, each share can be divided into dividends according to the shares; second, the cooperative organizes cultural and general social welfare institutions, and the funds are allocated from profits, such as building nurseries, kindergartens, clubs, libraries, and places for rest. The state also subsidizes rest places, and non-members can also enjoy them by paying, while members are treated free of charge. In addition, a "Children's Home" was organized to accommodate orphans who lost their parents during the war.

    At that time, the shortcomings of the cooperative were, first of all, that it obtained too much profit. For example, when the general market profit was 2%, it could obtain 4% profit. As a result, prices increased, such as a box of matches costing 5 cents would sell for 7 cents. At that time, the main purpose of the cooperative's business operation was to accumulate funds, so although there were many profits, it did not increase dividends, but accumulated the surplus as a fund. But this practice of pursuing profits was not beneficial to the cooperative itself. The government criticized the cooperative staff, saying that they were working from a capitalist point of view. Capitalists use a personal point of view to expand profits, and now cooperatives do the same, without considering the interests of the country, which is very harmful to the economic construction of the entire country. The second mistake was that the entire cooperative work stayed in the cities, and it did not play much role in the countryside at that time.

    During this period (1923 to 1925), cooperatives developed rapidly, and therefore there were also classifications in types. In cities, there were consumer cooperatives; in rural areas, there were supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. Rural credit cooperatives engaged in loans for seeds, horses, farm tools, fertilizers, etc. They were lent out in kind and recovered in kind.

    At the end of this period, that is, at the end of 1929, the organizational system of cooperatives underwent a great change, that is, the emergence of the district cooperative federation, which was responsible for the organizational work of the cooperatives in the district and was under the leadership of the provincial cooperative federation.

    The entire organizational system of cooperatives was established in this way: rural cooperatives joined the district cooperative federation, the district cooperative federation or larger cooperatives joined the provincial cooperative federation, the provincial cooperative federation joined the cooperative alliance of the republic where it was located, and the republic cooperative alliance was led by the central alliance, among which only the provincial cooperative federation of the Russian Republic directly participated in the central cooperative alliance and was subordinate to the central government. In this way, from the bottom up, the cooperative became a unified and complete trade ring. It must be added here that democratic centralism is the fundamental principle for the Soviet people to establish cooperatives. What does it mean? That is to say, at any cooperative meeting, the spirit of the minority obeying the majority must be implemented, and at the same time, the lower-level cooperatives must obey the higher-level cooperatives, and the regulations issued by the higher-level cooperatives must be followed by the lower-level cooperatives, so as to unify the management.

    The fourth stage, 1928 to 1935, was the period of implementing Stalin's five-year plan and agricultural collectivization, and the state invested most of its assets in heavy industry. The main difficulty during this period was the inability to fully supply the military and civilians with commodities and industrial manufactured goods. Under such circumstances, the cooperative's business operations had two characteristics: First, the cooperative not only had to do business, but also had to build its own agriculture, increase the planting area, cultivate vegetables, and raise livestock, with the purpose of increasing food supply to meet the needs of workers in the cities; at the same time, the cooperative distributed commodities among the masses. Therefore, the cooperative's organization had new supplements. Under the urban consumer cooperative, agricultural departments were added, and each consumer cooperative was allocated land in its own or other districts, which they operated themselves. Second, in the past, each cooperative union acquired things through the district cooperative union, but now larger cooperatives went to the countryside to acquire things themselves. In order to avoid mutual competition, each cooperative was assigned a certain procurement area. By 1935, the supply of commodities had improved, and the "purchase by certificate" system was abolished, and anyone could purchase what they needed from the cooperative.

    At this time, cooperatives that did not work well were abolished. Larger cooperatives in big cities were transferred to the Ministry of State Trade. The focus of cooperative work was placed in rural areas and small cities. Why do this? It is to strengthen the supply and marketing work in rural areas, so that all the cooperative's funds are invested in rural areas. Therefore, the entire cooperative organizational system has changed again. The organization of each cooperative itself is also changing, and the business policy of the cooperative union must be adapted to rural work. This transformation continued until the beginning of the anti-fascist war. During the war, cooperative enterprises were developed, and many cooperatives were organized.

    The fifth stage, from 1935 to 1940, was a period of striving to complete socialist construction. The first five-year plan built socialist heavy industry and mechanized collective agriculture. The second five-year plan (1933 to 1937) increased national consumption by more than two times; and the third five-year plan was to increase it by one and a half to two times more than the second plan. Therefore, it is necessary to promote Soviet trade and improve its organization. In 1935, the "purchase by certificate" system was abolished and free trade was implemented. In 1934, state-owned retail trade in cities accounted for more than 66%, while consumer cooperatives only accounted for more than 33%, so consumer cooperatives had lost their importance in cities. But at this time, the lives of farmers were improving day by day, and trade in rural areas faced new requirements and tasks. The old and narrow rural consumer cooperatives could not, in fact, fulfill these requirements and tasks. Therefore, in September 1935, the government decided to concentrate the consumer cooperatives' efforts on rural trade and procurement, and to completely hand over the urban trade network to the state trade system.

    In order to adapt to this new task, consumer cooperatives reorganized the entire system, merged and strengthened grassroots cooperatives, and established district cooperative alliances in each state as wholesale centers and leadership centers for rural consumer cooperatives. Urban-style district department stores and specialty stores were widely established in rural areas. In 1934, there were only 377 district department stores, and by 1940, there were 2,745 district department stores and 22,896 village department stores, as well as 1,547 cultural goods stores and 863 daily necessities stores. During this period, rural consumer cooperatives further developed the retail business of building materials and the business of rural public canteens and rural bakeries.

    The sixth stage, from the outbreak of the Soviet-German war to the end. During the war, all the work of cooperatives was subject to the needs of the war. The army needed clothes, shoes, and all other necessities, and the cooperative was responsible for supplying them. The focus of the cooperative's business operation was not on trade, but on the procurement work in rural areas. The cooperative had the following new tasks, and commercial activities were relegated to the second place. At that time, all state-owned enterprises, especially the state industrial sector, were completely working for the war and could not take care of the people. The cooperative manufactured things for the people and extensively launched a production movement, acquiring raw materials to supply its own factories. By the end of the war, the cooperative had many enterprises and factories. At that time, in terms of business, the main central organizational work was to acquire raw materials, the second was production management, and the third was commercial activities. Therefore, the entire organizational system and form of the cooperative have also changed. The organizational form of the cooperative should always follow the changes in tasks.

    The seventh stage, after the war, from 1945 to 1949. During this recovery period, cooperatives performed poorly in urban food supply. Therefore, cooperatives have been engaged in commercial trade in all cities, and cooperative leadership institutions at all levels have opened stores in new jurisdictions. From 1947 to 1948, statistics showed that 10,000 stores were opened in the entire Soviet Union. The nature of the store is different from that of the cooperative. The store is an enterprise organization, and the cooperative is an organizational institution. Therefore, in order to manage these stores, urban trade management bureaus were added under the cooperative unions at all levels, and the All-Soviet Union Trade Bureau was established under the Central Cooperative Alliance. In the supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas, a department specializing in acquisitions was added.

    Starting in October 1949, the Soviet Union made a new decision to transfer the trade preparations of urban cooperatives to the Ministry of Trade. It seemed to return to the pre-war situation, and the work of cooperatives was concentrated on supply and marketing in rural areas.

　　苏联合作社发展的几个阶段
    苏经
    苏联合作社的发展有七个阶段：
    第一个阶段，苏维埃政权成立以前。俄国第一个合作社是在一八六四年诞生的。三十四年后，又成立了合作社的中央联盟。革命前，俄国合作社的规模不大，在五十四个省份中，只有十四个省建立了合作社。那时的合作社，仍不过为资本主义经济经营的一环。资本家在经营合作社的股本中，控制了百分之五十以上的股份，并拟订以股份多少决定投票权的制度，便利资本家控制合作社的业务。那时合作社的主人，不是大商人，就是大的企业主，自己爱怎样做，就怎样做。这样的合作社就不能联合起来成为一个独立的系统，而流为资本家的代理人，为资本主义服务。
    第二个阶段，一九一八年——一九二二年。十月革命以后，合作社是在夺取政权和击败外国包围的过程中发展起来的，那时没有贸易和商业的关系存在，合作社的本身，就是一个商品的分配机构。国家实行严格的战时体制，规定商品通过合作社来分配给居民和军队。因此，全体公民都必须加入合作社。合作社规定股额，每个社员必须缴纳。这个时期就可以称为分配的阶段。合作社的组织只有下层和中央两级，没有省区的中间层。有些基层社的工作，便由中央直接领导。社员凭证购买合作社的商品，必须经过精密计算，所以合作社用人很多。
    第三个阶段，一九二二年末，战争结束，苏联由战时共产主义体制转变为新经济政策时期，开放了私营贸易，容许了私人资本主义生产的发展。因此，合作社的业务就走上新的道路；更具体的说，那就是合作社本身需要重新组织，拟订各种合作社的法规制度。
    按照新的组织系统，除中央合作社联盟外，又有像中国今日所有的省联合社和每县一个的县合作社，以县为城乡贸易的中心环节，同时进行城市和乡村的贸易。那时合作社很少，附属于合作社的小卖店和铺子也不多，商业活动比较多的均属私营贸易。就一九二二年来说，国家和合作社的贸易额还不到总贸易额的百分之二十；私商则在百分之八十以上。国家和合作社商业逐年排挤私商的结果，到一九二三年至二五年二年间，就起了急剧变化，造成国家与合作社的贸易占百分之八十，而私商仅占百分之二十的相反现象。及至一九二八年末，私商几已消灭。
    有这个时期内，合作社曾提出这样两个口号：（一）学习商业。（二）谁战胜谁。那就是说，合作社必须在市场上战胜私商。国家并给合作社种种便利和优待，如像：（一）合作社纳的税比私人经营少一倍；（二）铁路运费也比私商少一倍；（三）国家租赁给或分给合作社的房子比给私人的多一倍；（四）银行贷款给合作社的利息比贷给私商的低，银行对合作社放款的期限亦比私人资本长。
    其时，合作社的主要任务有三个：第一，执行经济核算以得到利润，换言之，合作社在业务经营中必须得到利润，以累积大量资金，如果合作社赔了钱，就得开门。第二，多多吸收群众参加合作社。第三，尽量为社员觅利益，使他们愿意参加合作社。此种利益可分两方面来说：其一，每一股都可以按股份分红；其二，合作社组织文化的和一般社会的福利机构，经费由利润中拨给，如建设托儿所、幼稚园、俱乐部、图书馆及休息的场所等。休息场所并由国家贴补，非社员也可出钱享受，社员则免费招待。此外又组织了“儿童之家”，以收容战时失掉父母的孤儿。
    那时合作社存在的缺点，首先就是所得利润太多。如当市场一般利润在百分之二的时候，它可以取得百分之四的利润。因此，价格提高了，如一盒五分钱的火柴会卖到七分钱。那时合作社业务经营的主要目的在积累资金，所以利润虽多，并不增加分红，而把剩余当作基金累积起来。但这种追逐利润的做法，于合作社本身不利。政府就批评合作工作人员，说他们是以资本家的观点来工作的。资本家用的是个人观点，扩大利润，现在合作社也如此，就没有考虑到国家利益，对于整个国家的经济建设，非常有害。第二个错误就是整个合作社工作逗留在城市中，那时在农村，没有起多少作用。
    在这个时期（一九二三年到二五年）内，合作社发展得很快，因而也有了种类上的划分。在城市中，有消费合作社；在农村中，有供销合作社和信用合作社。农村信用合作社从事种籽、马匹、农具、肥料等的贷款，放出时是实物，收回时也是实物。
    在这个时期结束时，即一九二九年末，合作社的组织系统又起了很大的变动，那就是区合作联合社的出现，它负责一区合作社的组织工作，而受省合作联合社的领导。
    整个合作社的组织系统是这样建立起来的，农村合作社加入区合作联合，区合作联合或比较大的合作社加入省合作联合，省合作联合加入所在共和国的合作社联盟，共和国合作联盟则受中央联盟领导，其中只有俄罗斯共和国的省合作联合直接参加中央合作联盟，隶属于中央。这样自下而上的，合作社就成为一个统一的完整的贸易环带。这里必须补充说一下，民主集中制是苏联人民建立合作社的根本原则。什么意思呢？那就是说，在任何合作会议上，必须贯彻少数服从多数的精神，同时下级社要服从上级社，上级社颁发的法规，下级社必须遵行，这样才能使管理统一化。
    第四个阶段，一九二八年到三五年是实行斯大林五年计划和农业集体化的时期，国家马大部分资产投放在重工业上。这个时期主要的困难，就是不能充分供给军民以商品和工业制造品。在这种情况下，合作社的业务经营有两个特点：第一，合作社不仅要作生意，而且要建设自己的农业，增加播种面积，培植蔬菜，饲养牲畜，目的在增加食料以供给城市中工人的需要；同时合作社又在群众中分配商品。因此，合作社的机构就有了新的补充，在城市消费合作社下，增添了农业部门，每个消费社都在本区或他区分配有土地，由他们自己来经营。第二，以前每个合作社联合都通过区合作社联合去收购东西，现在比较大一点的合作社，都亲自下乡去收购了。为避免相互的竞争，每个合作社分配了一定的采购区域。到一九三五年，商品供给的情况好转起来，取消了“凭证购买”制度，任何人都可向合作社购买自己所需要的东西。
    这时，工作不好的合作社就被取消。大城市中较大的合作社，转而隶属于国家贸易部。合作社的工作重心放在乡村和小城市中。为什么要这样做呢？就是要加强农村的供销工作，使合作社的一切资金都投向农村。因而，整个合作社组织系统又起了变化。每个合作社本身的机构也在变动，合作联合社的业务方针必须与农村工作相适应。这个转变，一直继续到反法西斯战争开始的时候。在战争中，又发展了合作事业，并组织了许多合作社。
    第五个阶段，一九三五到四○年，是努力完成社会主义建设的时期。第一个五年计划，建设了社会主义重工业和机械化的集体农业。第二次五年计划（一九三三年到三七年），使国民消费提高了两倍以上；而第三次五年计划又要比第二次计划提高一倍半到两倍。因此，就必须推广苏维埃贸易，健全其机构。一九三五年就废除了“凭证购买”制而实行自由贸易。一九三四年城市中国营零售贸易已占百分之六十六强，而消费社只占百分之三十三强，因此消费社在城市中已丧失其重要性。但这时期的农民生活日益提高，乡村中的贸易则面临了新的要求和任务。而旧的狭小的农村消费社，事实上已不能完成这种要求和任务。于是，一九三五年九月政府决定使消费社集中力量于农村贸易和采购，而把城市贸易网完全交给国家贸易体系。
    消费社为适应这一新的任务，乃把整个体系加以改组，基层社合并加强，各州成立了区合作联盟，作为农村消费社的批发中心和领导中心。城市型的区百货商店和特种商店在农村中普遍的设立起来。一九三四年只有三百七十七家区百货商店，到一九四○年就拥有二千七百四十五家区百货商店和二万二千八百九十六家村百货商店，以及一千五百四十七家文化用品商店和八百六十三家日用品商店。这一时期农村消费社更开展了建筑材料的零售业务及农村公共食堂、农村面包厂的业务。
    第六个阶段，由苏德战争的爆发到结束。战时合作社的一切工作，都服从于战争的需要。军队需要衣服、鞋子及其他一切必需品，合作社就负起供给的责任。合作社业务经营重点，非在进行贸易，而在农村中的收购工作。合作社有了如下所述的新任务，而把商业活动降到第二位。当时一切国营企业，特别是国家工业部门，完全为战争工作，无法照顾人民，合作社就为人民制造东西，广泛地展开生产运动，自己收购原料供给自己的工厂。战争结束时，合作社已有了很多的企业和工厂。那时在业务方面，主要的中心的组织工作为收购原料，次要的就是生产管理，第三个才是商业活动。因此，整个合作社的组织系统和形式也都变了，合作社的组织形态应该永远追随着任务的变化而变化。
    第七个阶段，战后，自一九四五年到一九四九年。在此恢复期内合作社在城市粮食供应方面，表现得不好。因此合作社已在一切城市中进行商业贸易，各级合作领导机构纷纷在新辖区内开设商店。由一九四七年到四八年，统计全苏联开设了一万个商店。商店的性质和合作社不同，商店是一个企业机构，合作社是一个组织机构。因此，为管理这些商店，在各级合作联合下添设城市贸易管理局，更在中央合作联盟下，设全苏联贸易局。在农村中的供销合作社，另外增加了一个专管收购的部门。
    一九四九年十月开始，苏联又作了新的决定，要城市合作社的贸易准备转交给贸易部。仿佛又回到战前那样，合作社的工作集中在农村的供销上。
