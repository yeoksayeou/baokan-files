[Jinan Dispatch] Correspondent Li Jiangyuan reports: Shandong Province has preliminarily developed workers' spare-time education in the past year, achieving considerable success in improving the cultural and political level of the working masses. However, issues such as the organization and leadership of workers' spare-time education, educational principles, and educational funding still need further resolution. According to statistics from March of this year, there are a total of 675 workers' spare-time schools in the province, with 75,467 students, of which industrial workers account for 76% of the total number of students. In terms of cultural education, various localities mainly conduct teaching in the form of spare-time schools, and also organize many literacy groups. Female workers who were illiterate in the past at Jinan Chengda Yarn Factory generally learned about 500 characters after attending spare-time school for seven months. In terms of political education, during the early period of liberation, current affairs, policies, and class education were conducted through methods such as large lectures, reports, establishing spare-time schools and clubs, and running training courses and holding forums. Workers have initially established a sense of ownership, their class consciousness and production enthusiasm have generally increased, and they have made many inventions and creations. At the same time, spare-time education has also played a significant role in resolving labor-management relations and promoting trade union work.

However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of workers' spare-time education over the past year, hindering the development of the work. The main ones are: (1) The provincial leadership has not been vigorous enough in promoting this work, failing to coordinate with relevant departments to resolve issues such as the organization and leadership, funding, principles, curriculum, teaching materials, and teachers for workers' spare-time education as soon as possible. (2) Failure to properly grasp key points and create experience to guide the overall work method has led to many detours in the establishment and consolidation of spare-time schools in various cities, with a fairly common occurrence of mid-term dropouts and even shutdowns. (3) Failure to timely shift workers' spare-time education to focus on cultural education according to the workers' demands. Some have not understood the significance of regularization, copying the set of ordinary regular schools, and neglecting the various decentralized learning organizations suitable for production conditions and the actual needs of workers. (4) Some cities have not yet established a unified organizational leadership structure for workers' spare-time education. Government cultural and educational departments, trade unions, and other relevant departments have insufficient communication and research, and cannot cooperate, forming multi-headed leadership without unified plans, requirements, and steps.

To ensure the smooth development of workers' spare-time education, Shandong Province has learned the following: First, there must be a clear and unified policy and a unified organizational leadership structure. For example, in the past, the Jinan Municipal Government and the Trade Union had a division of labor without a unified leadership structure for workers' spare-time education. The Municipal Education Bureau was responsible for scattered small factories, transportation workers, shop assistants, etc., and the Trade Union was responsible for large enterprises and factories. As a result, the division of labor formed a "split," with no contact with each other, and the work could not be coordinated. Both the government education departments and the trade unions could not cooperate well. Within the factory, there was also multi-headed leadership for spare-time education. The trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the factory administration each emphasized their own departmental education (such as trade union education, Communist Youth League education, etc.) and purposes, resulting in competition for spare time, disrupting the business education plan, and making it impossible for cultural education to proceed normally and systematically.

Second, it is necessary to overcome the "temporary viewpoint" and "guerrilla style," establish and improve the organizational structure of the school, have dedicated personnel in charge, strengthen leadership, establish a school affairs committee, and absorb teachers and student representatives to participate. The main courses (such as Chinese language and arithmetic) should preferably have full-time teachers, who are responsible for correcting homework, handling daily administrative work, and leading teaching research. In addition, it is also necessary to determine the academic system, curriculum, standards, teaching plans, and teaching objectives. Students will be issued certificates upon graduation, and in necessary cases (such as changing work areas), graduation or transfer certificates can be issued. Students should be placed in classes according to their test scores, and a system of roll call, leave, examinations, meetings, awards, and punishments should be established in a democratic manner. If some factories are restricted by conditions (such as workers not living in the factory or living far away) and cannot participate in spare-time school studies, various forms of decentralized learning, such as study groups, literacy groups, and literacy classes, should be adopted, and the curriculum should be followed in order. There is no need to mechanically stipulate the academic system. Graduation is based on completing the spare-time school curriculum, and a graduation certificate will be issued upon passing the examination.

Third, to run spare-time education well, it is necessary to obtain the attention of administrative leaders. Staff should clearly serve the working class, rely on the thinking of the workers, and follow the mass line. For example, the administrative leaders of Renfeng Yarn Factory did not have enough understanding of spare-time education, feared that it would affect production, and did not support the spare-time school, which led to its collapse. On the other hand, at Jinan People's Paper Mill, due to the attention of the leadership and all cadres, the factory director and section chiefs all participated in the school affairs committee, served as teachers, attended classes on time, and participated in discussions. It was clearly stipulated that meetings were not allowed during study time, and 200,000 yuan was allocated to print teaching materials. Therefore, the workers' enthusiasm for learning in the factory is increasing day by day. Currently, the number of students has reached 94% of the total number of workers in the factory. In addition, it is necessary to promote schools and social education institutions (such as cultural centers, education centers, libraries, etc.) to carry out spare-time education mainly for workers and other working people. Currently, most of the large, medium, and small schools and people's education halls in various cities in Shandong are equipped with workers' or shop assistants' spare-time schools, and they have all achieved good results.

　　山东建立职工业余学校六百余所
    七万五千工人入校学习
    组织领导等问题尚待进一步解决
    【济南通讯】通讯员李江源报道：山东省一年来已初步开展了职工业余教育，在提高工人群众的文化、政治水平上获得了不少成绩，但工人业余教育的组织领导、教育方针、教育经费等问题仍待作进一步的解决。据今年三月份统计，全省共有工人业余学校六百七十五处，学员七万五千四百六十七人，其中产业工人占学员总数的百分之七十六。在文化教育方面，各地主要是以业余学校的形式进行教学，同时也组织了不少识字小组。济南成大纱厂过去的文盲女工，上业余学校七个月后，一般都能识到五百个字左右。在政治教育方面，当解放初期，经过了上大课、作报告、建立业余学校、俱乐部以及开办训练班、召开座谈会等方式进行了时事、政策及阶级教育。工人们初步树立了主人翁的思想，阶级觉悟与生产积极性普遍提高，并有了许多发明创造。同时，业余教育在解决劳资关系、推动工会工作上也有很大作用。
    但一年间职工业余教育工作中还有很多缺点存在，阻碍了工作的发展。主要的是：（一）省级的领导上对这一工作推动不够有力，未能联系配合有关部门，及早解决关于职工业余教育的组织领导、经费、方针、课程、教材、教师等问题。（二）未能很好掌握重点创造经验以指导全盘的工作方法，因而各城市在业余学校的开办和巩固上都走了不少的弯路，相当普遍地发生过中途减员甚至停顿的现象。（三）未能根据工人的要求把职工业余教育及时转入以文化教育为主。有的则对正规化的意义领会不够，搬用普通正规学校的一套，忽视了适合于生产情况和工人实际需要的各种分散的学习组织形式。（四）部分城市的工人业余教育工作尚未建立起统一的组织领导机构，政府文教部门、工会以及其他有关部门互相联系研究也不够，不能协同进行工作，形成多头领导，没有统一的计划、要求和步骤。
    要使职工业余教育顺利开展，山东省体验到的有下列几点：首先，必须有明确统一的方针与统一的组织领导机构。如过去济南市政府与工会对职工业余教育工作有分工无统一领导机构，市府教育局负责分散的小工厂、运输工人、店员等，工会负责大的企业工厂，结果分工形成了“分家”，互不联系，工作不能协调，政府教育部门与工会均不能很好地配合。在工厂内部，对业余教育也是多头领导的，工会、青年团以及工厂行政各自强调自己的部门教育（如工会教育、青年团教育等）和目的，以致争夺业余时间，打乱了业务教育的计划，使得文化教育不能正常地系统地进行。
    其次，必须克服“临时观点”与“游击作风”，建立与健全学校的组织机构，要有专人负责，加强领导，设立校务委员会，吸收教员、学员代表参加。主要课程（如国语、算术）最好有专任教员，并负责批改作业、处理日常的行政工作和领导教学研究。此外还要确定学制、课程、标准和教学计划、教学目的，学员毕业时发给证书，在必要时（如调换工作地区）可发给肄业或转学证书。学员要按测验程度编班，并以民主方式建立点名、请假、考试、会议、奖惩等制度。如果某些工厂受条件限制（如工人不住厂，住址远等）而不能参加业余学校学习者，应采取多种多样的分散学习形式如学习小组、识字组、识字班等，按照课程顺序进行，不必机械地规定学制，以学完业余学校的课程为毕业，经考试及格，同样发给毕业证书。
    第三，办好业余教育，必须要得到行政领导上的重视。工作人员要明确为工人阶级服务，依靠工人的思想，走群众路线。如仁丰纱厂行政领导上，对业余教育认识不足，怕影响生产，对业余学校不扶持以致垮了台；而济南人民造纸厂，由于领导上及全体干部的重视，厂长、课长均参加校委会，兼任教员，按时上课，参加讨论会，明确规定学习时间不准开会，并拿出二十万元印教材，因此该厂工人学习情绪日益向上。目前学员已达全厂工人的百分之九十四。此外，要推动学校及社会教育机关（如文化馆、教育馆、图书馆等）开展以职工和其他劳动人民为主的业余教育。目前山东各城市的大、中、小学和民教馆，大部都附设有工人或店员业余学校，而且办得都有成绩。
