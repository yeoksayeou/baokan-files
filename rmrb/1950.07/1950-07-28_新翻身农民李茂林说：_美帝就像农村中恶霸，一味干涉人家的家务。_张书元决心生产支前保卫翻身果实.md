　　New Land Reform Farmer Li Maolin Says:
    “The U.S. Imperialists are Like Rural Bullies, Wantonly Interfering in Other People's Family Affairs.”
    Zhang Shuyuan Resolves to Produce to Support the Front and Defend the Fruits of Land Reform
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Li Maolin, a farmer from Huaifang Village who had been a tenant farmer for over twenty years and who underwent land reform to become a new land reform farmer, said: "The Chinese people have suffered enough from imperialist aggression and can no longer endure it. In recent years, the United States has provided guns, cannons, and money to Chiang Kai-shek to kill the Chinese people. We have long seen through this enemy behind the scenes. Now, the U.S. imperialists are invading Taiwan again. We are farmers who have been liberated and we must defend our land, and to do so, we must resolutely defend our country." He recalled that for more than twenty years, he had been oppressed by landlords and exploited by the Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes, forcing him to move from place to place, unable to even make a living. But now? Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, he has been liberated and has become a village cadre. He no longer has to pay rent for the more than twenty mu of rented land he used to cultivate. He also saw the people's government using work relief to repair rivers and canals this spring, and providing relief to disaster victims through tax reduction and exemption, a demonstration of its love for the people. He couldn't help but think of the Korean people, saying: "The people of North Korea and South Korea live two different lives. North Korea is a country of the people; the people of South Korea are oppressed, just like we were under Chiang Kai-shek, always longing for liberation." He then denounced the U.S. imperialists for directing the South Korean puppet army to attack North Korea and directly sending troops to invade. He said: "The U.S. imperialists are like rural bullies, wantonly interfering in other people's family affairs. But the Korean people will surely win, because the root of the North Korean People's Government is planted among the people." Zhang Shuyuan, a farmer from Huaifang Village who had also been liberated, said: "We must care for and sympathize with the Korean people's liberation war. We farmers must produce well to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, defeating the U.S. imperialist aggressors, and defending the fruits of our land reform."

　　新翻身农民李茂林说：
    “美帝就像农村中恶霸，一味干涉人家的家务。”
    张书元决心生产支前保卫翻身果实
    【本报讯】槐房村当了二十多年佃户、经过土改新翻身的农民李茂林说：“中国人民受帝国主义的侵略受够了，再也不能忍耐。这几年美国出枪、出炮、出钱供给蒋介石杀害中国人民，这个背后的敌人，我们早看清了。现在美帝又侵略台湾，我们是翻了身的农民，要保卫自己的土地，便要坚决保卫自己的国家。”他回想自己二十多年来因受地主的压迫和国民党苛捐杂税的剥削，东搬西逃，连生活都顾不住。可是，现在呢？在毛主席领导下获得了解放，并且当了村干部。自己以前租种的二十多亩租子地也不再交租了。他又看到今年春天人民政府利用工赈修浚河渠和照顾灾民缓征、免征的爱民措施。他不由自主地联想到了朝鲜人民，他说：“北朝鲜与南朝鲜的人民过着两种不同的生活，北朝鲜是人民自己的国家；南朝鲜人民是受压迫的，就和我们在蒋介石统治下一样，是天天盼望解放的。”接着他斥责美帝指挥南朝鲜傀儡军进攻北朝鲜和直接出兵侵略。他说：“美帝就像农村中恶霸，一味干涉人家的家务。可是，朝鲜人民一定能胜利，因为北朝鲜人民政府的根扎在了人民中间。”槐房村翻身农民张书元也说：“我们要关心和同情朝鲜人民的解放战争，我们农民要好好生产支援解放军解放台湾，打垮美帝侵略者，保卫我们的翻身果实。”
