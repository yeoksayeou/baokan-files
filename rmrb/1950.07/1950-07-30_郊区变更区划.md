　　Suburban District Reorganization
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Following the adjustment of Beijing's urban district divisions from twelve to nine districts in June of this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to change the numbering of the suburban districts, effective August 1st, in order to align with the numbering of the urban districts. The original Districts 13 through 17 will be renumbered as Districts 10 through 14, respectively. The original District 18, due to its small jurisdiction, was merged into the original District 15 in June of this year, and the number of the original District 18 has been cancelled. The original Districts 19 and 20 will be renumbered as Districts 15 and 16, respectively.

　　郊区变更区划
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市城区区划自今年六月由十二个区调整为九个区后，京市人民政府决定自八月一日起变更郊区各区的番号，以便与城区番号衔接。原第十三区至原第十七区依次改为第十区至第十四区。原第十八区因辖区过小，已于今年六月并入原第十五区，原第十八区番号取消。原第十九、二十区依次改为第十五、十六区。
