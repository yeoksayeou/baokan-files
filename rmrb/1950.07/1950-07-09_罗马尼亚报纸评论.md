Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 2nd. The Romanian news agency reported from Bucharest that on June 30th, newspapers in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, published commentaries on the armed intervention by US imperialists in Korean internal affairs.

	The editorial in the "Universul" newspaper emphasized: Truman's decision exposed that the instigators of the armed conflict within Korea were precisely the US imperialists who are currently brutally interfering in affairs that have nothing to do with them.

	"Spark of Youth" wrote: America's intervention in Korea proves that the imperialists have progressed from the stage of peddling war to adopting overt military force against the people of all countries who desire happiness and a free life. However, this heinous attempt by the US imperialists will certainly not achieve its aim.

	"Free Romania" pointed out: US imperialists are attempting to ignite the flames of war throughout the world. But the forces of peace opposing the "big stick policy" will certainly be able to dispel the sinister war clouds and smash the fist that hopes to strike the freedom and peace of the people by surprise.

　　各国人民声援朝鲜人民斗争  反对美帝国主义的武装干涉
    罗马尼亚报纸评论
    【新华社二日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：六月三十日，罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特各报纷纷就美帝国主义者武装干涉朝鲜内政发表评论。
    宇宙报的社论着重指出：杜鲁门的决定，暴露了朝鲜境内武装冲突的发动者，正是那些目前正在凶暴地干涉与他们毫不相干的事务的美帝国主义者。
    青年火花报写道：美国对朝鲜的干涉，证明了帝国主义者已经从贩卖战争的阶段进而对希望幸福与自由的生活的各国人民采取公开的武力手段了。然而，美帝国主义者的这个罪大恶极的企图一定达不到目的。
    自由报指出：美帝国主义者力图在全世界燃起战争的烽火。但反对“拳头政策”的和平力量，一定能够驱散阴恶的战云，并把那个希望出其不意地打击人民的自由与和平的拳头粉碎。
