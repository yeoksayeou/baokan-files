How to Resolve the Public-Private Relationship in the Salt Transport and Sales Industry
Li Qiuye, Deputy Manager of the China Salt Industry Company

I. Where do the Difficulties in Salt Transport and Sales Come From?

From the price drop in March to mid-May, the salt market, like other commodity markets, experienced widespread sluggish sales and the closure of some salt businesses. Unreasonable phenomena emerged in salt prices, such as market prices being lower than the state-owned company's listed prices, retail prices being lower than wholesale prices, sales prices being lower than production prices, and market prices being lower than costs. The degree of impact was greater in large cities than in small and medium-sized cities, and greater in the Central and Southern regions than in other regions. At that time, although state-owned salt companies maintained certain listed prices, they could only reduce the decline to a certain extent.

Faced with this situation, many private salt transport and sales merchants attributed the main reasons for the difficulties to excessive collection of salt excess profit tax, industrial and commercial tax, subscription to Victory Inflation-Indexed Bonds, and the crowding out of private salt merchants by state-owned salt companies. Therefore, they proposed the ideas of "state-owned salt companies should sell large quantities during price increases and suspend sales during price fatigue and sluggish sales" and "now we should prioritize private before public." They believed that this would solve the problem. If this were really the case, then the issue of the public-private relationship in the salt transport and sales industry would be very simple and easy to solve. But the reality is not like this!

Looking at the amount of salt sold to private merchants by the Changlu Salt Bureau, only 8,000 dan were sold in the entire month of April, compared to 390,000 dan in November and 280,000 dan in December of last year, a decrease of 34 to 47 times. Looking at the salt reported by private merchants to Hankou, it was 190,000 dan in December last year, but only 1,700 dan in April, a decrease of 110 times. Looking at the sales volume of state-owned salt companies, although sales increased slightly in some areas due to the addition of new institutions, the national sales volume also decreased significantly. For example, in April, the Hankou company only sold 1,900 dan and the Zhengzhou company only sold 1,400 dan, while private merchants sold 37,000 dan and 11,000 dan in the same locations. Looking at the monthly salt demand of the vast consumers, although there are peak and off-peak months, there will never be a difference of 100 times or 30 to 40 times. Even if the Hankou and Zhengzhou state-owned salt companies completely stopped selling at that time, they could not save the sluggish sales of salt and the partial closure of salt businesses in the two cities. Then the problem is very clear. The basic reason, in addition to being the same as other commodities due to the "disappearance of false purchasing power and the temporary reduction of real purchasing power," cannot be explained in any other way. Of course, the collection of excessive excess profit tax and industrial and commercial tax, and the subscription of Victory Inflation-Indexed Bonds, all crowded together in time; the excessive number of consignment stores set up by state-owned salt companies in some places, and the erroneous practice of adopting the same wholesale and retail prices in some units, also had a certain impact in certain areas.

II. The Role of Salt Companies in Difficulties

From March onwards, not only did the salt transport and sales industry experience difficulties, but salt production also faced difficulties. Spring is the peak season for salt production, requiring a large amount of production funds to be invested. Due to the stagnation of sales, producers could not sell their salt and demanded that state-owned salt companies purchase large quantities. Salt beach porters demanded that the company transport large quantities of salt or provide relief. Although state-owned salt companies had as much as 5 million dan of salt in storage in various places, on the one hand, in order not to let the salt price fall, they raised the listed price, so that private merchants would suffer less loss when selling salt below the listed price. On the other hand, in order to support production, they also carried out purchases and transportation on the salt beaches. From January to mid-June, excluding the number purchased by the Fujian Company which was not counted, a total of 3.8 million dan of untaxed salt and 1.58 million dan of taxed salt were purchased, and 80,000 jin of corn were lent to porters at the Dagu salt yard.

Salt is essential for the vast majority of people, especially in the lives of farmers, where it occupies an important position. There are many phenomena in areas far from the salt beaches where poor farmers cannot eat salt or cannot afford salt. In the mountainous areas of western Hubei, there are still places where 10,000 yuan is needed to buy a catty of salt. In order to reduce the burden on farmers, state-owned salt companies, in addition to welcoming private merchants to transport salt to the countryside, had to push it to the rural areas to stabilize salt prices. In the cities, in order to ensure that the vast working people obtain cheap salt, they had to set up a small number of retail salt units. Even at the end of May when prices had stabilized, because the government decided to reduce salt tax on June 1, the East China Salt Industry Company stopped selling for two days on May 30 and 31 to take care of private merchants. As a result, salt prices in large areas immediately rose sharply. The price of salt in Anqing was raised from 1,900 yuan per catty to 2,600 yuan, and it drove up the prices of various goods. Experience has proven that if the vast consumers lose the guarantee of state-owned companies, there is no guarantee in salt prices.

It can be clearly seen that the establishment of institutions and the partial handling of retail salt business by state-owned salt companies in some areas are not intended to squeeze out private merchants and monopolize the market, but to support production and protect the lives of farmers and the vast working people in the cities. It is something that must be done in order to regulate the supply and demand of salt and stabilize salt prices.

III. Solutions for the Future

Does this mean that there are no problems in the current public-private relationship in salt transport and sales? Absolutely not. The problems are mainly reflected in the two major issues of price and market, but we believe that they can be solved under the principle of overall consideration and mutual benefit.

(1) The price policy of state-owned companies should not only protect the interests of producers and consumers, but also protect the reasonable profits of transporters. We oppose transporters making windfall profits, but we welcome transporters making legitimate profits. In the implementation of price policies, we oppose the mechanical application of experience during periods of price instability. Because during periods of price instability, the main task of the listed prices of state-owned salt companies is to hold back the rise of prices or reduce the speed of their rise. This has little impact on the profits of transporters, because as long as they buy salt, the increase in salt prices, in addition to offsetting the interest of the firms, will also have considerable profits. With the support of false purchasing power, goods can always be sold. However, after prices stabilize, the situation changes fundamentally. Our listed prices should be transformed to adapt to the situation of stable prices. On the one hand, we should grasp the principle of stable salt prices, so that salt producers, transporters, and consumers can achieve a stable order through reasonable price policies. On the other hand, we should grasp reasonable price differences to ensure the smooth flow of goods. Therefore:

A. Stipulations on wholesale prices: In the cost composition, in addition to fixed figures and ratios such as salt price, salt tax, business tax, and stamp tax, items such as packaging fees, salt attrition, and management fees vary greatly due to different management. The calculation standard of state-owned salt companies should only be calculated based on the medium standard of reasonable management. This can represent the majority and promote cost reduction. On the issue of profits, in addition to calculating interest at the People's Bank of China's fixed deposit rate based on the general turnover rate of salt transport and sales industry funds, the standard of general social commercial profits should also be used to control salt industry profits. State-owned salt companies should set listed prices according to this standard and make appropriate adjustments based on regional, seasonal, and market supply and demand changes. This breaks the previous practice of setting prices only based on the actual situation of the company itself, so that wholesale prices have sufficient representativeness in the market.

B. Reasonable adjustment of retail prices: The principle of adjusting retail prices should be wholesale price plus labor costs, short-distance freight, attrition, taxes, operating expenses, and profits in order to guarantee the reasonable profits of retailers.

C. Regional price differences: In order to ensure the smooth flow of salt and facilitate urban-rural exchange, reasonable price differences should be maintained between regions. Except for those directly transported from the production area, which are calculated based on direct costs, those that are transshipped should be added with attrition, freight, taxes, and profits according to the medium standard of the operator.

D. Semi-wholesale prices (or bulk sale prices) exist in some cities. Taking Hankou City as an example, the price of each dan of semi-wholesale salt needs to be increased by 13,500 yuan based on the wholesale price, while the retail price is then added with labor costs, attrition, management fees, taxes, profits, etc. Without leaving the city, the increase in the semi-wholesale price compared to the wholesale price can be returned from the train to Hangu, and in river transportation, it can almost be transported to Yichang. We believe that this is an unreasonable price, and state-owned companies should not protect it in the listed price. We hope that shops that rely on semi-wholesale salt for a living should quickly change their business methods to facilitate survival and development.

(2) Salt Market Issues: In order to avoid blind transport and sales and affect salt prices, a planned free transport and sales policy should be adopted in salt transport and sales. The consignment stores of state-owned salt companies in various regions are still necessary for the time being to stabilize salt prices and regulate supply and demand, but cities with too many should be actively reorganized and massively reduced. After state-owned salt companies adjust prices and appropriately reduce consignment stores, the public-private relationship in cities should be reasonably resolved. However, on the public-private relationship in urban-rural exchange, it is still necessary to draw the close attention of those who operate salt transport and sales. Because according to the current situation, salt transporters are basically concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, while the vast farmers demand a timely supply of cheap salt. This situation is especially true in newly liberated areas. Since state-owned companies have the responsibility of "regulating supply and demand and stabilizing prices," they cannot but push it to the rural areas at the request of the vast farmers. With the development of operations, it will affect the sales of private salt transporters sitting in the cities. Therefore, we sincerely suggest to private salt transporters: changing business methods and pushing to the rural areas is a good direction at present. Of course, there are difficulties in pushing to the rural areas, but these difficulties can be overcome. State-owned salt companies and local governments have the responsibility to lead and protect the transformation of legitimate private salt transporters and push them to the rural areas. Only in this way can a long-term, solid, and reasonable public-private relationship be established in the salt transport and sales industry.

Finally, we believe that it is not enough to solve the price problem and the market problem. Private salt transporters also need to improve their operations, reduce costs, overcome bloated phenomena, eliminate waste, and adopt a small-profit, high-volume approach. With the improvement of the overall economic situation in the country, the salt transport and sales industry also has its reasonable development prospects.

　　如何解决食盐运销业的公私关系
    中国盐业公司副经理  李秋野
    一、食盐运销的困难从那里来的？
    从三月份物价下落到五月中旬为止，在食盐市场上，亦如其他商品市场一样，发生了普遍滞销与部分经营盐业的铺号歇业。盐价上也形成市价低于国营公司牌价，零售价低于批发价，销地价低于产地价，市价低于成本等不合理现象。在程度上是大城市重于中小城市，中南区重于其他区。当时国营盐业公司虽维持着一定的牌价，也只能在程度上减低其下落。
    在这种形势的面前，不少私营食盐运销商，把造成困难的主要原因，归根于征收食盐过分利得税，工商税，认购胜利折实公债，和国营盐业公司排挤私营盐商。因此，提出了“国营盐业公司在物价上涨中应当大量抛售，在价疲销滞时应当停售”、“现在应当先私后公一下”的主张。认为这样作，可以解决问题。假如真是这样，那么食盐运销业中的公私关系问题，就很简单，很容易解决的了。但事实并不是这样！
    就长芦盐局销给私商盐数来看，四月份全月仅八千担，与去年十一月份月销三十九万担，十二月二十八万担相较，减少了三十四倍至四十七倍。就私商报运汉口食盐来看，去年十二月为十九万担，而四月份则仅一千七百担，减少一百一十倍。就国营盐业公司的销售数量来看，虽在部分地区，因新增机构，多了一点销售量，但全国销量也大大降低了。如四月份汉口公司只销了一千九百担，郑州公司只销了一千四百担，而同一地点，私商则销了三万七千担和一万一千担。从广大消费者的月需食盐量来看，虽有旺月淡月，但绝不会有一百倍或三、四十倍的差数。当时即便汉口郑州国营盐业公司完全停售，也挽救不了两市食盐的滞销与经营食盐的铺号部分歇业。那么问题很清楚，基本原因，除了与其他商品同样是由于“虚假购买力的消失，与真实购买力暂时降低”以外，便得不到任何解释。当然，过分利得税、工商税的征收，和认购胜利折实公债，在时间挤在一起；某些地方的国营盐业公司，设置代销店嫌多，及某些单位错误的采用批发价与零售价一致的作法，在一定地区也有其一定影响。
    二、盐业公司在困难中所起的作用
    从三月份起，不仅食盐运销业发生了困难，食盐生产上也产生了困难。春季是食盐生产的旺季，需要投放大量生产资金。由于销路的停滞，生产者销不出盐，纷纷要求国营盐业公司大量收购，盐滩搬运工人，纷纷要求公司大量运盐或予以救济。国营盐业公司虽然在各地仓库存盐达五○○万担之多，但一方面为了不使盐价下落，乃将牌价吊起，使私商在牌价下销盐少受些损失，另一方面为了扶持生产，又在盐滩进行收购与运输。由一月份起到六月中旬止，除福建公司购入数未计外，共收购未税盐三八○万担，已税盐一五八万担，在大沽盐坨借给搬运工人玉米八万斤。
    食盐为广大人民所必需，特别在农民生活中，占重要地位。距离盐滩遥远地区，广大贫苦农民，吃不到盐、吃不起盐的现象是很多的。现在鄂西山区，仍有一万数千元买一斤盐的地方。国营盐业公司为了减轻农民的负担，除欢迎私商运盐下乡外，不能不推向农村，以稳定盐价。在城市中为了保证广大劳动人民获得廉价食盐，不能不设置了小部分的零售食盐单位。就在物价已趋稳定的五月底，因为六月一日政府决定降低盐税，华东区盐业公司为了照顾私商，在五月三十、三十一两天停售，而广大地区盐价马上突涨，安庆盐价由每斤一九○○元，哄抬至二六○○元，并带动各货上涨，经验证明，广大消费者，如果失掉了国营公司的保证，在食盐价格上是没有保证的。
    这就很清楚的可以看到国营盐业公司，在某些地区设置机构和部分的办理食盐零售业务，并不是想挤垮私商，独占市场。而是为了扶植生产，保障农民及城市广大劳动人民的生活。为了调剂食盐之供求，与稳定盐价而不能不去做的。
    三、今后解决的办法
    这样说来，目前食盐运销的公私关系中，就没有问题了吗？绝不是的。问题主要表现在价格与市场两大问题上，但我们认为，在统筹兼顾，各得其所的原则下，是可以得到解决的。
    （一）国营公司的价格政策，不仅要保障生产者消费者的利益，还应该保障贩运者的合理利润。我们反对贩运者发横财，但欢迎贩运者发正财。在执行价格政策上，反对机械的运用物价不稳时期的经验。因为在物价不稳时期，国营盐业公司牌价，主要任务，在于拖住物价的上涨，或减低其上涨的速度。这对贩运者的利润来讲，是没有什么影响的，因为只要买到盐，盐价的上涨数，除了抵补行庄利息外，还会有不少利润。在虚假购买力的支持下，有货总是可以卖出的。但物价稳定后，情况基本上变化了。我们的牌价，应当转变为适应物价稳定的局面。一方面掌握盐价稳定的原则，使食盐生产者、贩运者、消费者，通过合理的价格政策出现一个稳定的秩序。一方面掌握住合理差价，而使货畅其流。因此：
    甲、批发价格之规定：在成本组合上，除盐价、盐税、营业税、印花税等有固定数字及比例者外，其包装费、食盐折耗、管理费等项，因经营管理之不尽相同，悬殊颇大。国营盐业公司之计算标准，只有以合理经营之中等标准计算。这样，既可代表大多数，也可以提倡减低成本。在利润问题上，除按食盐运销业资金之一般周转率，照人民银行定期存款计息外，并按社会一般商业利润为标准，掌握盐业利润。国营盐业公司，据此标准，定出牌价；并根据地区、季节、市场供求变化等适当调整。打破以前只按公司本身实际情况计算订价办法，使批发牌价在市场上有其充分的代表性。
    乙、合理的调整零售价格：调整零售价的原则，应是批发价加力资，短途运费、折耗、税费、经营费及利润。以便保证零售者的合理利润。
    丙、地区差价：为了使食盐达到货畅其流，便于城乡交换，各地区间应保持合理差价，除由产区直接运输者直达成本计算外，凡经过转运者，需按经营者之中等标准加折耗、运杂费、税费及利润。
    丁、零批价（或称趸售价）在部分地区的城市中存在着，以汉口市为例零批每担盐价需按批发价加一万三千五百元，而零售价格，则再按零批价，加力资、折耗、管理费、税费、利润等，不出本市，零批价较批发价的增高数，可以从火车上退回汉沽，在江运上，差不多可以运到宜昌。我们认为这是不合理的价格，国营公司，在牌价上不应予以保护。希望依靠零批食盐为生的店铺，应迅速改变经营方式，以利生存和发展。
    （二）食盐市场问题：为了避免盲目运销，影响盐价，在食盐运销上，应采取有计划的自由运销政策。各地区国营盐业公司之代销店，为了稳定盐价，调剂供求，目前仍有其存在与设置的必要，但设置过多的城市，应积极整理，大量撤销。在国营盐业公司调整价格，及适当的撤减代销店以后，城市里的公私关系问题，应该得到合理解决。但在城乡交换中的公私关系上，仍然需要提起我们经营盐业运销者的密切注意。因为照目前情况看，食盐运销者基本上集中于大中城市。而广大农民，则要求及时供应价格低廉的食盐。这种情况，尤以解放不久的新区为甚。国营公司既负有“调剂供求稳定物价”的责任，在广大农民的要求下。就不能不推向农村。随着经营的发展，将影响到坐在城市里的私营食盐运销者的推销。为此，我们很诚恳的向私营食盐运销者提出建议：改变经营方法，推向农村，是当前的好方向。当然，推向农村是有困难的，但这种困难是可以克服的，国营盐业公司及各地政府，有责任来领导与保护正当私营食盐运销者之转变经营，推向农村。只有这样做，才能在食盐运销业上建立起长期的、巩固的、合理的公私关系。
    最后我们认为在价格问题，及市场问题解决了之后还是不够的，还需要私营食盐贩运业者，很好的改进经营，减低成本，克服臃肿现象，消灭浪费，采用薄利多销的办法。随着全国整个经济情势之好转，食盐贩运业也有其合理发展的前途。
