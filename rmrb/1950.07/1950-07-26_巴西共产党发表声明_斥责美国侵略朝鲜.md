Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 25th: TASS reported from Rio de Janeiro, according to a People's Daily Americas correspondent: The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Brazil, Prestes, issued a statement denouncing American aggression against Korea. The reporter pointed out that this statement has received widespread support from workers and the entire Brazilian people. The statement said: The war of aggression against Korea is a despicable and unforgivable crime, where American pilots are slaughtering women, children, and the elderly. Any honest person cannot but feel hatred and disgust for this atrocity that threatens all of humanity. We must explain the truth to millions of Brazilian people so that they are not deceived by the lies of Truman and the domestic imperialist lackeys. We want to drive the American aggressors out of Korea. Let the voices of workers, peasants, soldiers, sailors, students, and women unite into a powerful protest. This protest will spread throughout the world and will serve as a warning to imperialism and its lackeys in Brazil.
