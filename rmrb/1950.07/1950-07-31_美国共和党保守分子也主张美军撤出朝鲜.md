　　Xinhua News Agency, London, July 30th, TASS: The British newspaper "The Daily Worker" published a report by its correspondent in the United States on an interview with H. Meade. Meade is "a conservative Republican with strong anti-communist beliefs, a close friend of Syngman Rhee, and a former important official in the US occupation forces in South Korea."
    Meade said: We have no allies in Korea. Those people are fighting for their independence. They see us as the same as the Japanese. All we can do now is withdraw from there.
    When talking about the so-called "division" between North and South Koreans, Meade said: "They are all Koreans, and they want their country to be governed by Koreans. ... When the 38th parallel was first considered a permanent demarcation line, we began to make a real war within Korea inevitable."

　　美国共和党保守分子也主张美军撤出朝鲜
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：英国工人日报登载了该报驻美国特派记者所写的Ｈ·米德的访问记。米德是“在信仰上强烈反对共产主义的保守的共和党人，他是李承晚的密友和以前美国驻南朝鲜占领军的重要官员。”
    米德说：我们在朝鲜没有同盟军。那些人民是为他们的独立而战。他们把我们看做和日本人一样。现在我们所能做的一切，就是从那里退出来。
    米德在谈到所谓南北朝鲜人的“分歧”时说：“他们都是朝鲜人，他们希望他们的国家由朝鲜人管理。……当三八线一开始被认为是永久的分界线时，我们就开始使得朝鲜境内的真正战争成为不可避免了。”
