Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 29th. The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the evening of July 28th that the People's Army troops continue to engage in fierce fighting with U.S. ground forces in all areas of the front.

The People's Army troops who liberated Namwon, after fierce fighting with the U.S. Army, liberated Gorye (northeast of Jeolla Province) on July 27th.

The People's Army troops fought against approximately one regiment of U.S. troops near Hadong (southwest of Gyeongsang Province); as a result, over 500 U.S. troops were killed and over 100 were captured. Seven 105mm cannons, eighty machine guns, seventy motorcycles, and many rifles and carbines were seized.

A communiqué issued by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army on the morning of July 28th stated that the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down three U.S. aircraft on July 26th.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 29th. According to comprehensive reports from the Korean Central News Agency: People's guerrillas in Gyeongsang North and South Provinces, in coordination with the People's Army operations, have launched activities around Daegu and Busan, respectively. The People's guerrillas in Gyeongju, Yeongcheon, Yeongil, and Yeongdeok on the east coast of Gyeongsangbuk-do have, since July 23rd, destroyed important roads connecting the east coast and Daegu, dealing a great blow to U.S. military transportation; and causing the enemy, who attempted to use Daegu as a strategic stronghold, to fall into panic.

Guerrillas active in the Seongju, Goryeong, and Cheongdo areas of southwestern Gyeongsangbuk-do, in coordination with the activities of the eastern guerrillas, are threatening important transportation lines between Daegu and Gyeongsangnam-do, intercepting enemies attempting to flee to Busan. The guerrillas in Andong and Yecheon in northern Gyeongsangbuk-do, with the enthusiastic support of the local residents, are increasingly expanding their sphere of influence and launching activities towards Daegu. Guerrillas in Sangju, northwestern Gyeongsangbuk-do, are cooperating with the People's Army, which liberated Yeongdong and continued to pursue the fleeing enemy, dealing a heavy blow to the fleeing enemy.

The People's guerrillas in Gyeongsangnam-do have launched fierce activities in the vicinity of Busan, the main transportation port of the U.S. military and the enemy's last stronghold. Among them, a certain unit has approached an area only a few kilometers away from Busan. They are coordinating with the activities of the guerrillas in the Daegu area to threaten the transportation lines of the U.S. ground forces. The American invading army, seeing the guerrillas active behind them, destroying the railway lifeline for their army's reinforcements and supplies, has shown unusual panic.

Xinhua News Agency, July 29th. The increased activity of the Korean People's guerrillas behind the U.S. invaders has caused anxiety in the U.S. Department of Defense. According to a Washington dispatch from Agence France-Presse: at a press conference at the U.S. Department of Defense on the 24th, reporters "could see on the map of Korea some large red circles surrounded by dots. These circles indicate that guerrilla warfare has already been encountered in the rear of the U.S. military. There are also small red circles around some transportation centers." According to a United Press report: a U.S. military spokesman admitted on the 26th: "Communist guerrillas have infiltrated within miles of Busan, the only supply port for the U.S. military in Korea." "The largest guerrilla force is estimated to be about 1,500 men. This guerrilla force is currently active in the vicinity of the east coast east of Andong and Yeongdeok."

    【新华社平壤二十九日电】综合朝鲜中央通讯社报道：庆尚南北道的人民游击队为配合人民军作战，已分别在大邱周围与釜山附近展开活动。在庆尚北道东海岸的庆州、永川、迎日、盈德方面的人民游击队，自七月二十三日以来，破坏了贯通东海岸与大邱之间的重要道路，予美军的运输以莫大打击；并使企图将大邱作为战略据点的敌人陷于慌乱中。
    活动在庆尚北道西南的星州、高灵、清道一带的游击队，配合东部游击队的活动，威胁着大邱与庆尚南道之间的重要交通干线，截击企图逃往釜山的敌人。庆尚北道北部的安东、醴泉等地的游击队，在当地居民的热烈支持下，日益扩大其势力范围，向大邱方面展开活动。庆尚北道西北部尚州方面的游击队，与解放永同、继续追击逃敌的人民军协同作战，予逃敌以沉重打击。
    庆尚南道的人民游击队，在美军的主要运输港、敌人的最后据点釜山市附近一带展开猛烈活动。其中某部已经逼近了离釜山市仅数公里的地带。他们配合大邱方面游击队的活动，威胁着美军地面部队的运输线。美国侵略军看到游击队在他们背后活动，破坏了他们军队增援与补给的铁路生命线，已显示出异常惊慌。
    【新华社二十九日讯】朝鲜人民游击队在美国侵略者后方活动的加强，已引起美国防部的焦虑。据法新社华盛顿讯：在美国防部二十四日的记者招待会上，记者们“可以看到朝鲜的地图上有一些用圆点围成的大红圈。这些圆圈表明了在美军的后方已经遭遇了游击战。有些交通中心的周围也有小的红圈。”另据合众社消息：美国军事发言人于二十六日承认：“共产党游击队已渗入美军在朝鲜的唯一补给港口釜山数英里之内。”“最大的一支游击队的力量估计约有一千五百人。这支游击队目前在安东和盈德以东的东海岸附近一带活动。”
