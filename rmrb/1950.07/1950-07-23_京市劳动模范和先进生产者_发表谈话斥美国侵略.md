　　Beijing Model Workers and Advanced Producers
    Issue Statements Denouncing American Aggression
    [This newspaper] Beijing - Prominent model workers and advanced production workers from various factories in Beijing have issued statements strongly condemning the shameless crimes of American imperialism in invading Taiwan and Korea.
    Li Jinquan, a worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant who successfully developed the test welding rod, said: China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries love peace and democracy; but we are also not afraid of war. We, the people in democratic countries under the leadership of the Communist Party, have such strong confidence!
    Zhu Ning, the designer of the "May 1st" gas vehicle and director of the repair shop of the Municipal Public Bus Company, said: The United States' dispatch of troops to interfere in the Korean civil war, and its use of the outbreak of the Korean war as an excuse to intensify the enslavement of the people of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, and other Asian countries, and to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, were all things it had arranged long ago. Chairman Mao instructed us that this kind of open aggression by American imperialism is not only not scary; on the contrary, it is very beneficial to peace-loving people, especially to the people of Asia. Because it is now very clear to us who our friends are, who our enemies are, who is maintaining world peace, and who is a war instigator. We, the working class, must heighten our vigilance, work hard in production, and defeat this act of aggression by American imperialism!
    The Electric Tram Company's trade union posted slogans on the trams on the 19th, and some workers voluntarily started propaganda. He Kangzhong, the driver of the "World Federation of Trade Unions" tram, said: "I will try my best to promote [awareness] on the tram, so that everyone can recognize the American imperialists' conspiracy." Zou Deli, a model driver who received an award from January to April, said: "We are workers, and we resolutely support the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions. We will use production and savings to support the Korean people's war of liberation. I will maintain my achievements from January to April and respond to American imperialism's aggression with practical actions of saving vehicles and electricity."
    Wang Decheng, the director of the engineering office of the Telecommunications Bureau, an advanced worker who improved the T-type crossover and saved more than 870,000 jin of millet in this year's long-distance telephone construction project, said: In 1945, I interned at a telephone company in the United States for a period of time. There, I discovered something: the American big bourgeoisie is extremely hostile to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; while the American people, especially the working people, are very sympathetic to the liberation cause of the Chinese and Asian colonial peoples. I think this can explain why the American troops retreated so quickly and so panickly in Korea, and did not look like a combat force at all. I believe that although American imperialism vainly attempts to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, it will eventually be beaten by the Chinese people and flee in utter defeat!

　　京市劳动模范和先进生产者
    发表谈话斥美国侵略
    【本报讯】京市各工厂著名劳动模范和先进生产工作者，纷纷发表谈话，痛斥美帝侵略台湾和朝鲜的无耻罪行。
    制试电焊条成功的石景山钢铁厂工人李金泉说：我们中国、苏联和人民民主国家，是爱好和平民主的；但是我们也决不惧怕战争。我们在共产党领导下的民主国家的人民，就有这样坚强的信心！
    “五一”式煤气车的设计者，市公共汽车公司修理厂厂长朱宁说：美国出兵干涉朝鲜内战，并以朝鲜战事的爆发为借口，加紧对越南、菲律宾、马来亚等亚洲人民的奴役，阻止中国人民解放台湾，都是它早已安排好了的。毛主席指示我们，美帝此种公开侵略的行动，不但不可怕；反而对于爱好和平的人民，特别对于亚洲人民，是很有益处的。因为，谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人；谁是维护世界和平的，谁是战争挑拨者，已十分清楚地摆在我们面前。我们工人阶级，要提高警惕，努力生产，打败美帝国主义的这一侵略行动！
    电车公司工会已于十九日将标语贴在电车上，有的工人自动地展开了宣传，“世界工联”号的司机何康仲说：“我在车上要尽量宣传，使每个人都认识美帝的阴谋。”获得一——四月奖励的模范司机邹德利说：“我们是工人，坚决的拥护世界工联号召，我们要用生产节约来支援朝鲜人民的解放战争。我更要保持一月至四月的成绩，用省车、省电的实际行动来答复美帝的侵略。”
    改进Ｔ式交叉使今年长途电话建设工程节省八十七万余斤小米的先进工作者，电信总局工务室主任汪德成说：一九四五年，我在美国某电话公司实习了一段时期。在那里，我发现了这样一件事：美国大资产阶级，极端仇视苏联和人民民主国家；而美国人民，特别是劳动人民，十分同情中国和亚洲殖民地人民的解放事业。这一件事，我认为可以解释，为什么美军在朝鲜败退得那样快，那样慌张，简直就不像一个具有任何战斗力的部队。我相信，美帝虽然妄图阻止中国人民解放台湾，但是它终要被中国人民打得狼狈不堪，落荒而逃的！
