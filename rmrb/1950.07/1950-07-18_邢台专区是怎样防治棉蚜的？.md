How does Xingtai Prefecture prevent and control cotton aphids?
Hebei Province Xingtai Pest and Disease Prevention Station, Ye Zurong

How to prevent and control cotton aphids? This is a common concern for all cotton-producing areas. Xingtai Prefecture has some experience in this area.

In order to complete the cotton planting task in Xingtai Prefecture, the Xingtai Pest and Disease Prevention Station focused on preventing and controlling cotton aphids during May, June, and July. Wei County, Nangong, Ningjin, and Neiqiu were selected as key counties. The total cotton planting area in the first three counties exceeds one million mu, accounting for half of the total cotton planting area in the entire prefecture. In these key counties, one extension worker was specifically assigned to each county, and another technical cadre was assigned to巡回 assist the work. In each county, key areas and key villages were selected to strengthen the practical work in key villages and areas to create typical demonstrations, and to take care of the progress of work in the entire county.

The main prevention methods are weeding and spraying/dipping with tobacco water. The weeding work is combined with the existing weeding and seedling protection movement in various places to promote the masses to remove various weeds. Before the wheat harvest, most places had generally weeded two or three times. In order to cultivate the habit of thorough weeding among the masses, it is also advocated to pull weeds. The promotion method is to mobilize elementary school students to do demonstrations during teaching breaks. In Wujiaqiao Village, Ningjin, more than 70 elementary school students were mobilized to work three times, pulling 200 jin of weeds in the fields of military families. In Xicun, more than 40 elementary school students were mobilized to spend three days of spare time pulling more than 400 jin of weeds. In cotton-growing areas, because of the lack of feed, some people pull weeds to feed cattle, and some people pull them for fuel. By giving full play to this point, many people can be mobilized to pull weeds. According to materials from various villages, the weeding work has achieved great results under this slogan.

The promotion of spraying and dipping with tobacco water encountered several difficulties. First, there are ideological obstacles for the masses. Most people think that it doesn't matter if there are some aphids on cotton, and there is no need to bother to treat them, and they can't be cured. For example, Sun Xiaodan from Zhao Village in the tenth district of Ningjin said, "Aphids have just come out, it doesn't matter." When he was asked to go to the field to see that there were two or three hundred insects on each plant, he was surprised and said, "Why didn't they show up a few days ago? This is a natural disaster, there is no way to cure it. I think some people will die on the cotton this year." Some people even think that it is good for cotton to have cotton aphids. They say, "Cotton gathers into a fist, one year is worth three years," "Cotton has aphids, and there will be a play to sing in the fall." Second, the newly emerged seedlings cannot be bent down, and it is impossible to dip them with a bowl, and it is too expensive to spray with a sprayer. Third, during the wheat harvest season, all the labor force in the countryside is concentrated on the wheat harvest work, and they cannot take care of cotton aphids. Women and children also participate in picking up wheat. For example, Bai Laotong from Wujiaqiao, Ningjin, said: There is only one wheat harvest a year, who is not busy harvesting wheat, how can there be time to treat aphids? Fourth, from late May to early June, various counties are reorganizing districts, and cadres are being transferred and their emotions are uneasy.

The above difficulties are overcome by the following methods.

(1) Assist various counties to universally establish and activate the pest control organizations in districts and villages: For example, in early June, Ningjin County established pest control organizations in 225 villages in nine districts. County Chief Zhai personally took charge of key villages, urged village cadres to buy tobacco leaves and soak them in water, mobilized women in their own families to do demonstrations, and put the prepared tobacco water on the streets for the masses to take and try, thus mobilizing the masses in the whole village.

(2) Compile propaganda materials and disseminate them widely. Compile "Quick Rhymes for Treating Cotton Aphids," "Methods for Preventing and Controlling Pests," and "Slogans for Preventing and Controlling Pests" for use by pest control organizations in various places. These materials are written on blackboards in various places, and each village broadcasts these materials through loudspeakers every night. In Xicun, Ningjin, two people broadcast these materials in a question-and-answer manner, which can arouse the interest of the masses. In order to avoid the fatigue and boredom of cadres and the masses in various places with too many gatherings, extension worker Lü Wenqing did not convene many meetings of farmers, but seized the opportunity to publicize the elimination of cotton aphids and promote the prevention of cotton aphids in various gatherings in counties, districts, and villages. Comrade Lü Wenqing used this method to conduct publicity work in more than 20 villages in Nangong County.

(3) Assist various places in technical training for pest control. Use various training courses in various places to popularize the technology of treating cotton aphids. For example, in Henghe Village, Wei County, 30 people including village cadres, labor heroes, and teachers were gathered to jointly study the technology of treating cotton aphids and the use of sprayers. In the 360-person teacher training class in Ningjin and in the district agricultural construction assistant training class, the technology of treating cotton aphids was discussed enthusiastically. In each training class, tobacco was taken for everyone to soak in person and try using a sprayer.

(4) Urge various places to prepare agents for treating cotton aphids in advance, and advocate collective purchase of tobacco leaves, unified soaking in water, distribution by household, and unified distribution of burdens. Now the pest control headquarters in various places have invited the directors of supply and marketing cooperatives to be members in order to uniformly purchase tobacco leaves. According to statistics from the first half of June, the supply and marketing cooperative in Wei County bought 5,000 jin of tobacco leaves from Xingtai, and is now buying the second batch. The county government also bought several thousand jin of rotenone powder from Linqing. The masses in Hugu Village, Tenth District of Ningjin, bought 1,000 jin of tobacco leaves. Fifteen villages in the Second District of Neiqiu uniformly bought 141 jin of tobacco leaves, and after uniformly soaking them in water, distributed them to 1,600 households for application, mobilizing 1,617 people to treat 1,884 mu of cotton aphids.

(5) Mobilize teachers and students to help with publicity and demonstrations. In Ningjin, the county government called on teachers in each village to choose a song and sing the "Quick Rhymes for Treating Cotton Aphids," and stipulated that the results of publicity on treating cotton aphids should be used as part of the performance appraisal. This has improved the importance of all teachers. In Wei County, the extension worker changed the tune of "We Workers Have Strength" to "Our Children Treat Cotton Aphids." The children were very interested in singing, and then divided them into groups and took them to the field to guide them to dip cotton with tobacco water. At first, the masses were afraid that the children would trample on the cotton seedlings and did not welcome them. Later, when they saw that the children were well organized and the tobacco water was very effective, they all competed to welcome the children to dip the cotton.

(6) Mobilize the masses to control pests as a whole. At mass meetings, first report on the seriousness of the pest and the reason why everyone must take action to eliminate them, and then the masses democratically decide that everyone must treat them, and use the opinion of the majority to urge those who are unwilling to treat them. The masses in the Third District of Neiqiu were mobilized in this way. Liu Laotaitai, an anti-Japanese war veteran from Tiantai Village, said when dipping cotton seedlings with tobacco water in the field: "If we don't dip, we will harvest less cotton and weave less cloth. Which is worth more? One jin of tobacco leaves is only more than 3,000 yuan, and we will have it if we harvest more cotton. Those who don't dip, we will ask them for the reasons why they don't dip, and we will hold them responsible."

(7) Launch competitions and challenges to increase interest. In Tiantai Village, the Third District of Neiqiu, the democratic decision of the masses was used to challenge Shentou Village, mobilizing 120 people to universally dip 82 mu of cotton with tobacco water once in two days. They also strive to dip it a second time. Extension worker Yu Guang reported this work to the county government, and at the same time went to Shentou Village to mobilize a counter-challenge, mobilizing 318 people to dip 187 mu of cotton in two days. The county government sent a letter of commendation, and Comrade Yu took the letter to Tiantai Village to announce it, further increasing the enthusiasm of the cadres and masses in Tiantai, and mobilizing all those who had been dipped once to join the wave of aphid control.

　　邢台专区是怎样防治棉蚜的？
    河北省邢台病虫防治站  叶祖融
    如何防治棉蚜？是所有产棉区共同关心的问题。邢台专区在这方面已有一些经验。
    邢台病虫害防治站为了完成邢台专区植棉的任务，五、六、七三个月均以防治棉蚜为中心，并选定了威县、南宫、宁晋、内邱四个县为重点县。前三县的植棉总面积超过一百万亩，占全专区植棉总面积的一半。在这几个重点县中，每县专派推广员一人，另以技术干部一人巡回协助工作。在每一县又择定重点区和重点村，一面加强重点村和区的实际工作，创造典型示范；一面则照顾全县的工作进展。
    防治的方法主要是除草和喷沾烟草水。除草工作是结合着各地已有的锄草保苗运动，推动群众锄去各种杂草，到麦收前各地大多已普遍的锄了两遍或三遍。为了养成群众彻底除草的习惯，所以还提倡拔草。推行的方法是利用教学空闲发动小学生做示范，在宁晋武家桥村曾动员了七十余小学生，工作了三次，在军属的地里拔了二百斤的杂草。又在西村动员了小学生四十余人，用三天课余时间，拔了杂草四百多斤。在棉区因为饲料缺乏，所以有些人拔草喂牛，也有些人拔去做燃料。把这一点充分发挥起来，就可以发动许多人去拔草。据各村材料，在这个口号下，拔草工作，得到了很大的成绩。
    推行喷沾烟草水时遭遇到几种困难。第一、是群众思想上的障碍。多数人均认为棉花上生一些蚜虫不要紧，不必费力去治，治也治不了。如宁晋十区赵村的孙小旦说：“腻虫才出来，不要紧的。”当时叫他下地看，每棵上有二、三百个虫，他又很惊异地说：“怎么前几天还不显呢，这是天灾，没法治的，我看今年有些人要死在花上的。”更有些人认为棉花生了棉蚜才好，他们说：“棉花攒攒拳，一年顶三年”，“棉花生了腻，秋后唱个戏”。第二、初生的幼苗弯不下来，用碗沾够不到，用喷雾器喷射又太费药水。第三、麦收时期，乡村中所有的劳动力都集中在麦收工作上，顾不到棉蚜。妇女儿童也都参加拾麦。如宁晋武家桥白老桐说：一年就一个麦秋，谁不忙着收麦子，那有工夫治腻虫。第四、五月下旬至六月上旬，各县正在重新划区整编，干部在调动中，情绪不安。
    上述的困难是用下面几种办法克服的。
    （１）协助各县把区村治虫组织普遍建立和行动起来：例如宁晋县六月初在九个区内建立了二百二十五个村的治虫组织，翟县长亲自掌握着重点村，督促村干买烟叶浸水，发动自己家里的妇女做示范，并把配成的烟草水放在街上让群众拿去试用，这样把全村群众带动了起来。
    （２）编制宣传资料广事宣传。编写《治棉蚜快板》、《害虫防治办法》、《防治害虫的标语》，供给各地治虫组织采用。各地都把这些材料写在黑板报上，各村每天晚上用广播话筒把这些材料广播。在宁晋西村由两个人，各拿一个话筒用一问一答的方式，把这些材料广播出来，很能引起群众的兴趣。推广员为了避免各地的干群对于过多的集会感到疲劳和厌烦所以不多召集农民群众开会，只是在县区村里碰到各种集会时，抓到机会就宣传除治棉蚜，推广员吕文卿同志用这种方式在南宫县的二十几个村里做了宣传工作。
    （３）协助各地治虫技术训练。在各地利用各种不同的训练班，普及治棉蚜的技术。如在威县横河村里召集了村干、劳动英雄、教员等三十人，大家共同研究治棉蚜的技术，喷雾器的使用方法，在宁晋的三百六十人的教员训练班上，在区农建助理训练班上，都把治棉蚜的技术展开了热烈的讨论。在每一次的训练班上都拿了烟草让大家亲自动手浸泡，亲自用喷雾器试用。
    （４）催促各地预先准备治棉蚜的药剂，提倡集体购买烟叶，统一浸水，按户分配，统一分配负担。现在各地的治虫指挥部都请供销社主任当委员，就是为了统一购办烟叶。据六月上半月的统计，威县的供销社从邢台买了五千斤的烟叶，现又在买第二批，县政府也由临清买了几千斤的鱼藤粉。宁晋十区胡谷村群众买了一千斤烟叶。内邱二区十五个村统一买了烟叶一百四十一斤，统一浸水后，分配给一千六百户施用，动员一千六百一十七人，治了一千八百八十四亩的棉蚜。
    （５）发动教员学生帮助宣传和做示范。在宁晋，县政府号召每一村的教员必须自己选一歌谱把《治蚜快板》唱起来，又规定以宣传治蚜的成绩作为考绩的内容之一。这样便提高了全体教员的重视。在威县，推广员把《咱们工人有力量》的曲子改为《咱们儿童治棉蚜》，儿童们很有兴趣唱，然后把他们分成小组带下地去实地指导用烟草水沾棉花。起初群众怕儿童把棉苗踏坏，不欢迎。后来看见儿童组织得很好，烟草水沾上很有效，就都争着欢迎儿童去沾了。
    （６）发动群众全体治虫。在群众会上先报告虫害的严重和必须大家动手除治的道理，然后由群众民主决定大家一定要治，用大多数的意见来督促不愿治的人。内邱三区的群众就是这样发动起来的。天台村抗属刘老太太在地里用烟草水沾棉苗时说：“不沾就少收许多花，也少织一段布，那个值的多呢？一斤烟叶只三千多元，多收些花就有了。不沾的，我们要他说不沾的理由，要他们负责任。”
    （７）发动竞赛挑战，来提高兴趣。在内邱三区天台村利用群众民主的决定，向神头村挑战，动员一百二十人，两天内把八十二亩棉花普遍用烟草水沾了一遍。还争取沾第二遍。推广员于光同志一面将这工作情况呈报县政府，一面到神头村发动应战，动员三百十八人把一百八十七亩棉花也在两天内沾完了。县政府发下表扬的信，于同志又把这信拿到天台村去宣布，再提高了天台干部和群众的热情，把已沾过一遍的人都动员起来，卷进了治蚜浪潮。
