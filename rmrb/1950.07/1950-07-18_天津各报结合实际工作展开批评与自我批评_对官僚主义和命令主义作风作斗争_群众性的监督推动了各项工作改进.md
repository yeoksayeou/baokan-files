Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th—Since the National Conference on Journalism, Tianjin's newspapers have combined with their actual work to launch criticism and self-criticism, achieving significant results. In April, May, and June, the Tianjin Daily published 121 pieces of criticism and self-criticism articles and letters from readers. The newspaper also added editor's notes or separate commentaries to important criticism articles. The Progress Daily published only two criticism articles in April, but this increased to 27 in May and June. The content of these articles mainly criticized certain institutions' bureaucratic work style, failure to cherish state property, and the phenomena of commandism, corruption, and waste by a small number of cadres.

After being criticized in the newspapers, most institutions were able to conduct in-depth self-examination and propose improvement measures, which were published in the newspapers. This spirit of daring to criticize and daring to accept criticism has played a positive role in promoting practical work. For example, the leaders of the state-owned North China Paper Manufacturing Company's Tianjin factory previously had a serious bureaucratic work style. From October of last year to February of this year, 48 accidents occurred continuously, damaging machinery and causing serious losses to state property. After strict criticism from the Tianjin Daily and the Beijing Workers' Daily, the company's manager and the factory director conducted in-depth self-examination and immediately began to improve production management. The production enthusiasm of the factory's employees was greatly enhanced, and they put forward many reasonable suggestions. After these suggestions were adopted and implemented, the factory successfully completed its production tasks for May and June. The state-owned Tianjin Motor Transport Company's business development was greatly affected due to the serious bureaucratic work style of its leaders. The company's vehicle turnover rate gradually declined, and major accidents occurred frequently. After criticism from the Tianjin Daily, the company immediately held various forms of meetings to conduct self-examination and formulate specific measures for improvement. As a result, the company's business has improved significantly, and work efficiency has also greatly increased. The mileage of running vehicles in May increased by 27% compared with April.

The newspaper's criticism has also played a considerable role in improving the work style of cadres. For example, in April, an incident occurred in Tianjin where employees of a department store restricted residents' access, infringing on their human rights. After criticism from the Tianjin Daily, the company conducted an in-depth self-examination and disciplined the employees who made mistakes. After the administrative personnel of the Xingang Ship Repair Machinery Factory illegally detained workers, the factory also punished the personnel involved after newspaper criticism. The citizens responded very well to these disposals. In addition, newspapers have published many articles criticizing the work style of cadres, and the criticized institutions or individuals have made public self-examinations or explanations in the newspapers.

The newspapers received strong support from the leading organs in the process of conducting criticism and self-criticism. This is one of the important reasons why the newspaper's criticism and self-criticism work has achieved practical results. When some of those who were criticized did not have sufficient understanding of their mistakes, the leading organs would conduct patient education, pointing out the root causes of their mistakes and helping them to seriously examine and correct them. For example, in March, after the Tianjin Daily criticized the bureaucratic work style of the Tianjin Infectious Disease Hospital, the Municipal Health Bureau notified all municipal hospitals to widely study the Tianjin Daily's criticism articles to inspect their leadership. With the help of the Municipal Health Bureau, the Infectious Disease Hospital conducted repeated self-examinations. However, some people adopted incorrect attitudes towards newspaper criticism. For example, after Cao Yaozhen, a worker at the publicly-owned Tianjin Rubber Branch Factory, wrote a letter to the Tianjin Daily criticizing the factory's staff, the factory's administration and trade union questioned the newspaper; the head of the factory's communications station even forced the critic, Cao Yaozhen, to admit his mistake. The Tianjin Daily has exposed this matter and criticized the factory. At the same time, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also sent people to educate the head of the factory's communications station and called on trade unions at all levels in the newspaper not to interfere with the freedom of workers to contact newspapers. In another example, a female worker at the Sixth Factory of the China Textile Company was injured for some reason, and the factory's trade union delayed the resolution for a month and a half. After the Progress Daily published an article criticizing the factory's trade union, the administrative and trade union leaders of the factory actually sent a letter the next day requesting a correction. After the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Textile Industry Trade Union exposed this incident, the factory's trade union and administrative leaders made a self-examination and properly handled the worker's injury incident. The citizens of Tianjin are very concerned about the criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers. For example, after the Tianjin Daily published an article criticizing the bureaucratic work style of the Infectious Disease Hospital, it received more than 50 letters from people from all walks of life, expressing their agreement with the criticism and requesting the hospital to conduct an in-depth self-examination. This mass supervision has played a positive role in improving work.

However, there are still some problems in the newspaper's work of criticism and self-criticism. For example, a small number of institutions and factories still have the idea of not wanting others to criticize their shortcomings. Individual institutions have adopted a delaying attitude towards newspaper criticism or letters from readers, and have been slow to reply. Newspaper offices sometimes simply forward the letters of criticism to the relevant departments and consider the matter closed, failing to take the initiative to follow up and handle them, resulting in a large backlog of letters. These shortcomings are currently being actively corrected.

　　天津各报结合实际工作展开批评与自我批评
    对官僚主义和命令主义作风作斗争
    群众性的监督推动了各项工作改进
    【新华社天津十六日电】自全国新闻工作会议以后，天津市各报结合实际工作展开批评和自我批评，已有显著的成绩。天津日报四、五、六三个月中，共发表了批评和自我批评的稿件及读者来信一百二十一件。该报对重要批评稿件，并加编者按语或另作评论。进步日报四月份仅发表有关批评稿二件，但五、六两月就增加到二十七件。这些稿件的内容，大部是批评某些机关的官僚主义作风、不爱护国家资财，以及少数干部的强迫命令作风和贪污浪费等现象的。
    大部分机关经过报纸批评后，都能深刻检讨，并拟定改进办法，在报纸上公布。这种勇于批评和勇于接受批评的精神，对实际工作起了积极的推动作用。如国营华北造纸公司天津厂的领导人员过去曾存在严重的官僚主义作风，从去年十月到今年二月连续发生损坏机器等事故四十八次，使国家资财遭到严重损失。经天津日报及北京工人日报提出严格批评后，该公司经理及该厂厂长等都作了深刻检讨，并立即着手改进生产管理。该厂职工生产情绪因之大为提高，他们提出了很多合理的建议。这些建议被采纳实施后该厂已胜利完成五、六两月份的生产任务。国营天津汽车运输公司由于领导人员有严重的官僚主义作风，营业的开展受到很大影响。该公司的车辆周转率逐渐下降，经常发生重大事故。经天津日报批评后，该公司当即召开了各种形式的会议进行检讨，拟定具体办法加以改进，该公司的业务因而有显著改进，工作效率也大为提高，五月份跑车里程即较四月份提高了百分之二十七。
    报纸的批评对改进干部作风也起了相当的作用。如天津市四月份曾发生百货公司职员限制居民出入的侵犯人权的事件。经天津日报批评后，该公司进行了深入检讨，处分了犯错误的工作人员。新港修船机工厂行政人员非法扣押工人，经报纸批评后，该厂对有关人员也予以处分。市民对这些处置的反映都很好。此外，各报还发表很多批评干部作风的稿件，被批评的机关或人员都在报纸上作了公开的检讨或解释。
    各报在进行批评和自我批评的过程中，得到领导机关的大力支持。这是报纸批评与自我批评工作收到实际效果的重要原因之一。当有些被批评者对其错误认识不足时，该机关领导方面即进行耐心的教育，指出其错误的根源，帮助他们认真检讨和改正。如三月份天津日报批评天津市传染病医院的官僚主义作风，市卫生局即通知市属各医院普遍学习天津日报的批评稿件，来检查领导。传染病院在市卫生局的帮助下，进行了反复的检讨。也有一些人对于报纸的批评采取不正确的态度。例如公营天津橡胶分厂工人曹耀珍给天津日报写信，批评该厂工作人员后，该厂行政及工会竟向报纸提出质问；该厂通讯分站负责人还强迫批评者曹耀珍承认错误。天津日报已将此事揭露，并对该厂提出批评。同时天津市总工会也派人对该厂通讯分站负责人进行教育，并在报纸上号召各级工会不应干涉工人和报纸联系的自由。又如，中纺公司第六厂一个女工因故受伤，该厂工会拖延一个半月未解决。进步日报发表了批评该厂工会的稿件后，该厂行政及工会负责人次日竟去信要求更正。市总工会、纺织业工会揭发这件事之后，该厂工会与行政负责人才作了检讨，正确地处理了工人受伤的事件。天津市民群众对报纸上的批评和自我批评非常关心，如天津日报在发表批评传染病院官僚主义作风的稿件以后，收到各界市民的来信共达五十余封，纷纷表示同意这个批评并要求医院作深入检讨。这种群众性的监督，对改进工作起了积极的推动作用。
    但各报在进行批评与自我批评工作中，还存在着一些问题。如少数机关和工厂仍存在着不愿别人批评缺点的思想。个别机关对报纸批评或读者来信采取拖延态度，迟迟不复。报社也有时把批评的信件，只转到有关部门就算了事，未能主动抓紧处理，积压信件的情形很多。这些缺点，目前正积极纠正中。
