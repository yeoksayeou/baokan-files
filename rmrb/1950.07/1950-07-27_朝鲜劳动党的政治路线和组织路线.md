The Political and Organizational Line of the Workers' Party of Korea
    Jin Il-sung
    This is the second and third sections of the speech given by Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people and the Workers' Party of Korea, on December 25, 1947, at the first anniversary of the founding of the North Korean Workers' Party. This speech is divided into four sections: (1) The Great Achievements of the Labor Party in the Past Year, (2) The Correctness of the Party's Political Line, (3) The Founding of the Labor Party and the Correctness of the Organizational Line, and (4) Our Current Tasks in Welcoming the First Anniversary of the Party's Founding. Recently, some readers have written to inquire about the founding process and organizational situation of the Workers' Party of Korea. We are publishing the middle two paragraphs of this speech here for reference.
                          —Editor

    The great development of the Labor Party and the victory of democratic construction are by no means accidental; they are the result of all party members closely uniting around the Party Central Committee and correctly implementing the Central Committee's political line. Our Party has always had a correct political line and the entire Party has made every effort to ensure the complete realization of the correct political line. Our Party has closely cooperated with the people, put forward various policies representing and supporting the people's interests in order to realize the people's interests and demands, and used all methods to promote their realization.

    When our Party's predecessor—the North Korean Communist Party—was founded after the August 15th Liberation in 1945, it established its basic political proposition. At that time, it had already put forward to all the Korean people that the basic task of our Party was to establish a democratic Korean People's Republic, and at the same time put forward the current specific basic tasks:

    1. Launch a broad democratic national united front movement, form a united front with patriotic democratic parties, unite broad democratic forces, and establish a democratic People's Republic to ensure our nation's complete autonomy and independence.

    2. Eliminate the first obstacle to the cause of democratic national construction—the remaining forces of Japanese imperialism and the running dogs of international fascism—to ensure the democratic development of our nation.

    3. In order to establish a unified provisional government for all of Korea, first of all, people's committees, the true organs of people's power, should be organized in various places, various democratic reforms should be implemented, the people's living standards should be improved, and all factories, enterprises, and railway transportation destroyed by the Japanese invaders should be restored to establish the foundation for a democratic and independent country.

    4. In order to complete this task, our Party should be further developed and consolidated; strive for the broad masses, consolidate and develop social organizations, organize and unite the masses of all strata.

    This is the goal of the common struggle of our Party and the entire people since August 15th—the Party's political line. Our Party absorbed all true patriots who fought for the liberation of the Korean nation at home and abroad, and advanced elements who fought for the interests of the working masses, and organized the Korean Communist Party and the Korean New People's Party (formerly the Independence League).

    We united all democratic forces, waged a merciless struggle against the heinous remnants of Japanese imperialism and its ilk—feudal forces and international fascist running dogs—so that all party members understood that the most urgent task for building a democratic, free, and independent country was to consolidate their own party and absorb the broad masses to unite around the party.

    Our Party started with hundreds of patriotic fighters to build the party initially, and then absorbed outstanding advanced elements from the broad working masses. From August 15th to the period when the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference decided to issue a statement, the party's organizational work was widely carried out, and within only a few months, hundreds of thousands of outstanding party members were absorbed, and hundreds of thousands of mass organizations were around the party.

    At the time when the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the Korean issue, which was the most decisive and clearly indicated the democratic development and autonomous independence of Korea, was issued, the Party had already possessed the strength to enter the first stage of realization. The decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference clearly revealed to the people the opposing situation of reactionary and progressive forces in Korea. In other words, the reactionaries attempted to sell Korea to a certain imperialism again and turn Korea into an imperialist colony. The activities of the feudal forces and reactionaries blatantly raised their heads. In order to cultivate young democracy to achieve the construction of a completely autonomous and independent Korea without any foreign interference, the progressive forces launched a struggle against these reactionaries, international fascist running dogs, remnants of Japanese imperialism, and backward feudal forces. Our Party absolutely supported the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the Korean issue and launched a head-on struggle against all reactionary forces that opposed this decision. Strengthen the unity of the people, implement democratic reforms, improve the people's living standards, and establish the political and economic foundation of a democratic country. Since then, our Party has consolidated its own party in actual struggle, united the broad masses; and tempered the Party and the masses in actual struggle, and fought for victory. Our Party shattered the conspiracy of the reactionary forces to oppose the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, called on the entire Party to first implement the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in North Korea, and the people responded to our Party's call. In the demonstration movement in support of the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference held throughout North Korea on January 6th, more than three million people participated. Subsequently, on February 8th, our Party, together with various political parties, social organizations, and local people's committees, jointly established the North Korean Provisional People's Committee. At the conference of various political parties and social organizations on February 8th, the following eleven current tasks of the Provisional People's Committee were decided:

    1. Thoroughly eliminate pro-Japanese elements and anti-democratic reactionaries, promote capable cadres to take charge of the guidance work of various institutions, and consolidate local administrative organs.

    2. Prepare in the short term to sort out the land and forests confiscated from Japanese invaders and pro-Japanese reactionaries, appropriately nationalize the land and forests of Korean landlords, abolish the tenant system, and distribute the land to farmers free of charge.

    3. Enterprises and institutions should serve the supply of daily necessities for the productive masses and strive for their development.

    4. Completely restore railway, shipping, communication, and transportation undertakings.

    5. Sort out the system of banks and financial institutions and correctly establish trade and financial policies.

    6. Improve and develop small and medium-sized enterprises, and encourage the creativity of entrepreneurs and businessmen.

    7. Actively assist the labor movement, and extensively set up a network of factory committee organizations in mines, enterprise institutions, and transportation industries.

    8. Reform the people's education system to adapt it to the needs of democratic reform, expand primary and secondary schools, train educational talents, and compile national language teaching materials.

    9. Educate the people in the spirit of true democracy, eliminate the remaining poison of Japanese imperialist enslavement education, and widely launch cultural enlightenment movements for people of all strata.

    10. Urgently establish appropriate policies for the major food problem in North Korea.

    11. Correctly explain to the general public that the true meaning of the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the Korean issue is the fairest and most in line with the interests of the Korean people.

    Our Party fully supported the current tasks of the People's Committee decided at the conference, determined it as the political line of action of our Party, concentrated efforts, and worked hard to realize its decisions. Our Party also fully supported the Land Reform Law promulgated by the People's Committee on March 5th. Land reform was the first great work carried out by our Party in democratic reform. We must mobilize the unyielding efforts of the entire Party to carry out the land reform cause to obtain victorious results. In the implementation of land reform, our Party enhanced the Party's prestige among the broad masses of farmers, and farmers believed that only our Party could represent and guarantee the interests of farmers. Our Party not only enhanced its political prestige among the masses of farmers, but also absorbed a large number of progressive and outstanding elements to join our Party, improving the quantity and quality of our Party.

    During the land reform, our Party mobilized many workers to actively participate in assisting farmers to promote this work, so that it progressed smoothly, making the unity of farmers and workers more consolidated.

    Actively assist the cause of the Soviet-American Joint Commission, which was convened in March 1946 based on the decision of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and promote its victory. Although the cause of the Joint Committee did not succeed due to the obstruction of the reactionaries, after this meeting, the conspiracies of the perverted imperialists and the heinous destructive acts of the traitorous reactionaries were exposed to the people.

    Therefore, our Party and the entire people must step up the consolidation of the democratic forces of the entire people, and use the favorable conditions and environment of North Korea with the help of the Soviet army to further consolidate the democratic base.

    Our Party fully supported the twenty-point platform (note) published by the People's Committee on March 23, 1946, using this platform as the program of action for our Party and all social organizations, and fought with all our strength for its realization.

    Our Party played the most pioneering role in the struggle to realize the Labor Law published on June 24, the Law on Agricultural Tax in Kind published on June 27, the Law on Equal Rights for Men and Women published on July 30, the Law on Nationalization of Industry published on August 10, and the Democratic Election Law. The masses of the people realized that our Party is a truly working people's party and won the support and support of the entire people. As mentioned above, our Party had a clear basic political line from the beginning, and put forward correct struggle slogans at each stage, so that the entire Party implemented the central political line, and thus achieved great victories, ensuring the smooth development of the Party. Through all these struggles, not only all party members understood the Party, but also the entire people had a correct understanding of the Party's political line. Therefore, the Party's political line must win the support and victory of the entire people due to the continuous struggle of all party members.

    As mentioned above: To unite democratic forces to complete the great task of building a completely autonomous and independent country, we must first consolidate the strength of the Party, so our Party established a correct organizational line from the beginning and did its best to ensure the Party's unity and consistency.

    When the Communist Party—the predecessor of our Party—was founded after August 15th, it did its best to ensure the purity of the Party; at that time, even pro-Japanese elements and reactionaries mixed into the Party, undermining the Party's political line, infringing on the interests of the masses, and forming a phenomenon of the Party being divorced from the masses. There were also local sectarianists who hindered the Party's unity, and many bad elements infiltrated the Party, trying to split our Party into sectarian cliques. Left-leaning opportunists and right-leaning opportunists mixed into the Party, deliberately distorting the Party's political line, and hindering the implementation of the Party's correct political line in various ways. However, the Party stood on the correct organizational line and launched a merciless struggle against all reactionary elements. On December 20, 1945, the Third Enlarged Committee of the North Korean Communist Party decided to launch a struggle against all reactionary elements who had mixed into the Party, review party members, issue party membership cards, and expel reactionary elements and pro-Japanese elements who had mixed into the Party; severely crack down on local separatistists with liberal sectarian tendencies who violated the central political line and violated the central instructions, and left-leaning elements who violated the central political line and stubbornly adhered to the left-leaning opportunist line, ensuring ideological unity and organizational consistency within the Party. Through these struggles, the Party consolidated its party spirit and party discipline, and thereby ensured victory in all democratic reforms.

    Our Party appropriately implemented the transformation of the Party's organizational line with the development of objective situations, making it a more extensive mass party; in other words: as a result of the implementation of democratic reforms in North Korea for a year, workers, farmers, and intellectuals have undergone great changes.

    Workers have gotten rid of imperialist exploitation, have the right to work in the people's own enterprises and institutions, work for themselves, for the people, and for society, and actively participate in all aspects of national political life, thus universally improving the political level of the working class. Farmers were exploited and oppressed by the landlord feudal tenant system in the past, but now they have their own land and can work freely, so farmers also actively participate in the democratic national construction movement and exert their initiative in political life. In the past, most of the intellectuals served Japanese imperialist exploiters, but now they serve their own country and nation and the interests of the people. The intellectuals have shown significant changes in their concepts and opinions; they have indeed shown a spirit of standing on a new and correct line and serving the people in everything. All facts require further consolidation of the unity of workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and this must be done; only by strengthening the unity of workers, farmers, and intellectuals can the foundation of the democratic united front be further consolidated; therefore, it is felt that a party is needed that can represent the common interests of workers, farmers, and progressive intellectuals; therefore, a merger proposal was put forward for the Communist Party, which represents the proletariat, and the New People's Party, which represents the interests of farmers and intellectuals. When this major proposal was put forward to the party members of the two parties, it immediately received warm support and support from all party members, and this great party merger work was completed in just a short month.

    After the merger of the two parties, a wide range of workers, farmers, and advanced intellectuals were absorbed to join our Party, and in a very short period of time, it expanded to hundreds of thousands of party members. With the expansion and growth of our Party, the unity of the people and the unity of workers, farmers, and intellectuals became more consolidated. The close unity of workers and intellectuals has ensured the smooth progress of democratic reform and national construction movements. Although our Party has become a broad mass party, it has not relaxed its struggle within the Party, and has done its best to ensure the Party's organizational and disciplinary nature. Recently, our Party has comprehensively inspected the party committees of various provinces, sorted out the organizational system of our Party, and at all levels of the party committee is constantly preparing a large number of powerful cadres who can organize the masses, unite the masses, and guide the cause of democratic reform.

    Our entire Party is closely united around the Party Central Committee and can defend against and defeat all enemies. All this proves the correctness of the Party's organizational line. (Translated by Qing Yan, Propaganda Department of the North Korean Chinese Overseas Union General Association)

    (1) Thoroughly eliminate all remnants of Japanese imperialist rule in the political and economic life of Korea.

　　朝鲜劳动党的政治路线和组织路线
    金日成
    这是朝鲜人民和朝鲜劳动党领袖金日成在一九四七年十二月二十五日北朝鲜劳动党创立一周年纪念日所发表的演讲词中的第二节和第三节。这篇演讲词共分四节，即（一）劳动党一年来之伟绩，（二）党政治路线的正确性，（三）劳动党的创立和组织路线的正确性，（四）迎接创党一周年，我们的当前任务。最近有些读者来信问到朝鲜劳动党的创立经过和组织情况，我们特把这篇演讲词的中间两段刊载于此，以供参考。
                          ——编者
    劳动党的这样伟大的发展和民主建设的胜利，决不是偶然得到的；是由于全体党员紧密团结在党中央的周围，正确的执行中央政治路线的结果。我党在任何时期，都有正确的政治路线并且全党为保障完全实现正确的政治路线尽了一切力量，我党与人民紧密合作，为实现人民的利益和要求，提出了代表与拥护人民利益的各种政策，并用一切方法促其实现。
    我党的前身——北朝鲜共产党在一九四五年八一五解放后建党时，确立了基本的政治主张，当时已向全朝鲜人民提出了我党的基本任务为：建立民主主义的朝鲜人民共和国，同时提出当前的具体基本任务：
    一、展开广泛的民主主义民族统一战线运动，与爱国的民主各党派结成统一战线，团结广大的民主力量，建立民主主义人民共和国，以保障我们民族的完全自主独立。
    二、肃清民主主义建国事业上的第一个障碍物——日本帝国主义残余势力和国际法西斯走狗们，以保障我们民族的民主发展。
    三、为了建立全朝鲜民主统一临时政府，首先在各地方要组织真正的人民政权机关——人民委员会，实施各种民主改革，提高人民生活水平，恢复日寇所破坏的一切工厂企业和铁道运输，以建立民主独立国家的基础。
    四、为完成这种任务，应更加发展巩固我们的党；争取广大群众，巩固与发展社会团体，组织与团结各阶层群众。
    这就是从八一五后，我党和全体人民共同斗争的目标——党的政治路线。我党吸收一切在国内国外为朝鲜民族解放而斗争的真正的爱国者，为勤劳大众的利益而斗争的先进分子，组织了朝鲜共产党和朝鲜新民党（前独立同盟）。
    我们团结了一切民主力量，与万恶的日帝残余势力和它的同类——封建势力以及国际法西斯走狗们，进行无情的斗争，使全体党员了解要建设民主自由独立国家的最紧急的任务便是：必须巩固自己的党，吸收广大群众团结于党的周围。
    我党由数百名的爱国斗士，开始初步建党，继而从广大的劳动大众中，吸收优秀的先进分子。自八一五至莫斯科三外长会议决定发表期间，广泛展开了党的组织工作，仅在几个月之内，吸收了数十万优秀的党员，党的周围已有数十万的群众组织。
    在朝鲜问题上，最有决定性，而明示着朝鲜民主发展和自主独立的莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜问题的决定发表当时，党已具备了踏入实现的第一阶段的力量。莫斯科三外长会议的决定，在人民面前，显然的揭露了朝鲜的反动势力和进步势力对立形势，换句话说：反动分子企图把朝鲜重新出卖给某帝国主义，使朝鲜变成帝国主义殖民地。封建势力反动分子的这种活动露骨的抬起头来了。进步的势力为了培养年青的民主主义使其不受任何外国干涉而达到建设完全自主独立的朝鲜，与这些反动派和国际法西斯走狗，以及日本帝国主义残余势力，和落后的封建势力展开了斗争。我党绝对支持莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜问题的决定，与反对此决定的一切反动势力，展开了正面的斗争。加强团结人民大众，实施民主改革，提高人民生活水准，确立民主国家的政治经济基础。此后，我党在实际斗争中巩固了自己的党，团结了广大的群众；在实际斗争里锻炼了党和群众，为争取胜利而斗争。我党粉碎了反动势力企图反对莫斯科三外长会议决定的阴谋，号召全党首先在北朝鲜实施莫斯科三外长会议决定，人民大众起而响应了我党的号召；一月六日在北朝鲜全境所举行的拥护莫斯科三外长会议决定的示威运动中，竟有三百多万群众参加，随后在二月八日，我党与各政党，社会团体以及各地方人民委员会，共同创建了北朝鲜临时人民委员会。二月八日于各政党社会团体大会上，决定临时人民委员会当前十一条任务：
    一、彻底肃清亲日分子及反民主的反动分子，提拔有能力的干部，担任各机关的指导工作，巩固各地方行政机构。
    二、准备在短期间内整理从日本侵略者及亲日反动分子所没收的土地和森林，适当的把朝鲜地主的土地和森林收归国有，废除租佃制，把土地无偿的分配给农民。
    三、企业机关要为生产大众生活必需品的供给而服务，并力谋其发展。
    四、完全恢复铁道、航运、通信交通运输事业。
    五、整理银行金融机关的体系，正确的树立贸易金融政策。
    六、改良与发展中小企业，奖励企业家和商业家的创造性。
    七、积极帮助劳工运动，在矿山企业机关和运输产业部门，广泛的设置工厂委员会的组织体系网。
    八、改革人民教育制度，使其适应民主改革的需要，扩充初等中等学校，培养教育人材，编纂国文教材。
    九、以真正的民主精神教育人民，肃清日帝奴化教育的余毒，广泛的向各阶层人民展开文化启蒙运动。
    十、对北朝鲜重大的食粮问题，紧急树立适当政策。
    十一、向一般人民正确的解释莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜问题的决定的真意，是最公正最切合朝鲜人民利益的。
    我党全面的支持该大会上所决定的，人民委员会的当前任务，确定为我党行动的政治路线，集中力量，努力实现其决定。我党并全面支持三月五日人民委员会所发表的土地改革法令，土地改革乃是我党在民主改革中，第一步进行的伟大工作，要动员全党不屈不挠的努力进行土地改革事业，以获得胜利成果。土地改革的实施中，我党在广大农民群众中提高了党的威信，并且，农民认为只有我党才能代表与保证农民的利益，我党在农民大众中，不但提高了政治威信，吸收了大量进步的优秀分子参加我党，提高了我党的数量和质量。
    我党在土地改革中，动员许多工人，积极参加协助农民推动这一工作，使其顺利的进展，使农民和工人的团结更加巩固。
    积极协助一九四六年三月基于三外长会议决定，而召开的苏美共同委员会的事业，促其获得胜利。虽然由于反动派的阻挠，共委会的事业未获成功，但此次会议后，变态的帝国主义者的阴谋，和卖国反动派的万恶的破坏行为，在人民面前是暴露无遗了。
    因此我党和全体人民，必须加紧巩固全人民的民主力量，利用北朝鲜有苏联军队帮助的有利条件和环境，更加巩固起民主根据地。
    我党全力支持一九四六年三月二十三日人民委员会所发表的二十条政纲（注）以此政纲作为我党以及全体社会团体的行动纲领，并为其实现尽全力斗争。
    我党在实现六月二十四日发表的劳动法令，六月二十七日发表的关于农业现物税的法令，七月三十日发表的男女平等权法令，八月十日发表的产业国有化法，民主选举法令等斗争中，起了最先锋的作用。人民大众觉悟到我党是真正勤劳人民的政党博得全体人民的拥护和支持。如上所述：我党开始就有明确的基本政治路线，在每一个阶段提出了正确的斗争口号，使全党贯彻中央政治路线，因之取得伟大的胜利，保障了党的顺利发展。经过这一切斗争，不但全体党员了解党，并且全体人民对党的政治路线也有了正确的认识。因此我党的政治路线，由于全体党员继续不断的斗争必定取得全体人民的支持和胜利。
    如上所述：团结民主力量，来完成建设完全自主独立国家的伟大任务，首先必须巩固党的力量，所以我党从开始就树立了正确的组织路线，尽全力保障了党的统一性和一致性。
    八一五后创立共产党——我党的前身时，就尽力于保障党的纯洁；当时甚至有亲日分子，反动分子混入党内，破坏党的政治路线，侵犯群众利益，形成党与群众之脱离现象等。又有地方宗派主义分子妨碍党内统一，有许多坏分子潜入党内企图分裂我党成宗派的小集团，左倾机会主义分子，和右倾机会主义分子们，混入党内，故意歪曲党的政治路线，在各方面妨碍党的正确的政治路线的执行。可是党站在正确的组织路线上，与一切反动分子展开了无情的斗争。一九四五年十二月二十日，北朝鲜共产党第三届扩大委员会，决定与混入党内的一切反动分子展开斗争，审查党员，发党证，驱逐混入党内的反动分子和亲日分子；对于违犯中央政治路线，违犯中央指示的自由宗派主义倾向的地方割据主义者，及违犯中央政治路线，固执左倾机会主义路线的左倾分子，给以严重的打击，保障了党内思想上的统一和组织上的一致。党经过这种种的斗争，巩固了党性，及党的纪律性，以此在一切民主改革上，保障了胜利。
    我党随客观形势的发展，适当的执行了党组织路线的转变，使成为更广泛的大众性的政党；换句话说：由于北朝鲜一年来，实施民主改革的结果，工人农民知识分子有了很大的变化。
    工人摆脱了帝国主义的剥削，有权利在人民自己的企业机关里劳动，为自己为人民为社会而劳动，积极参加一切国家政治生活，因此普遍的提高了劳动阶级的政治水平。农民过去受地主封建租佃制的剥削和压迫，现在自己有了土地，可以自由劳动，因之农民也积极参加民主建国运动，在政治生活上发挥他们的积极性。知识分子在过去，大部分是为日本帝国主义剥削者服务，现在却为了自己的国家民族，为人民的利益而服务了，知识分子在观念和见解上表现了显著的转变；确实表现了站在新而正确的路线上，一切为人民服务的精神。一切事实要求更加巩固劳动者农民与知识分子的团结，并且必须这样作；唯有加强工人农民知识分子的团结，才能更加巩固民主主义统一战线的基础；因而感到须要一个能代表劳动者农民进步知识分子共同利益的政党；因提出了代表无产阶级的共产党，和代表农民知识分子利益的新民党的合并提案。这一重大的提案提出于两党党员面前时，立即获得全体党员热烈的支持与拥护，仅在短短一个月的期间内，就完成了这一伟大的并党工作。
    两党合并后，广泛的吸收了工人、农民、先进知识分子参加我党，在极短的期间内，扩大到数十万党员，随着我党这样的扩大和成长，人民的团结，工人农民知识分子的团结越加巩固起来了。工人知识分子的紧密团结，保障了民主改革和建国运动的顺利进展。我党虽已成为广泛的大众性的政党，可是在党内并未放松斗争，尽力保障了党的组织性和纪律性，最近我党全面检查了各道党部，整理了我党的组织系统，并在各级党部经常准备着大量能组织群众，团结群众，指导民主改革事业的有力干部。
    我党全体紧密的团结在党中央的周围，能防御和战胜一切敌人，这一切都证明党组织路线的正确性。（北朝鲜华侨联合总会宣教部青燕译）
    【注】朝鲜人民委员会所发表的二十条政纲如下：
