　　Repairing the Iron Smelting Furnace Through Discussion
    ——An Example of Cooperation Between Engineers and Workers
    Lu Niangao, Yin Chonghua

　　The three eight-ton iron smelting furnaces of the foundry department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, since they started operation at the end of June last year, had gradually increased their iron smelting capacity from more than 30 tons per day to more than 50 tons by February this year. However, the furnaces gradually developed problems: the furnace walls were severely eroded. The 300 mm thick refractory bricks lining the furnace walls were reduced to about 30 mm after the furnace was shut down (i.e., stopped firing), and in some places, only 5 or 6 mm remained. In more severe cases, molten iron would flow into the tuyere box or burn through the furnace wall's iron plate. Originally, the furnace had to burn for 16 hours a day, but at this time, it would get too hot after only 11 or 12 hours, often forcing an early shutdown. Molten iron was leaking from the furnace bottom. The furnace tuyeres were also unclear. Sometimes slag would solidify on the tuyeres, and sometimes molten iron would flow directly into the tuyeres, affecting the air supply. Bridging (i.e., the charge failing to descend) occurred inside the furnace. These problems became more and more serious every day. However, the demand for molten iron was increasing day by day. Because the foundry department was then enthusiastically launching a production competition, the pipe casting and sand casting workshops were desperately demanding molten iron. Shen Yingzhou, the foundry section chief and assistant engineer, was making plans to increase production, but was very anxious about this matter.

　　At this time, when engineers and workers were examining the causes of the furnace accidents, they all made the mistake of emphasizing objective difficulties. They said: First, the furnace is old, what can be done? Second, the quality of the refractory bricks is poor; the ash content of the coke is too high. But there are no good bricks or good coke now, so what can be done? At the same time, because Engineer Shen did not cooperate enough with the workers, he came up with his own ideas and did not discuss them properly with the workers, and personally went to the furnace to operate it. Therefore, the workers were unhappy and unwilling to actively find solutions. As a result, no good solution was found.

　　The furnace became increasingly damaged. On March 1, the bridging situation was so severe that two large iron balls weighing one ton each were used to smash the contents in the furnace. The next day, Engineer Shen thought about it and simply went to the military representative of the pipe casting department and said to him: "Don't engage in the production increase movement, it will definitely collapse! It's better to wait until the furnace is repaired and proceed steadily." Comrade Li Wenliang, the military representative, was sick in bed at this time, and said: "No, the production increase movement must still be carried out, and it must start on March 3rd according to the plan." The military representative told him: Discuss more with the workers and ask everyone to come up with ideas; if you come up with a solution yourself, it is best to do it together with the workers.

　　Engineer Shen thought: That's right, the workers have been guarding the furnace for many years, they have much more experience than me, let's find a solution together with everyone!

　　Engineer Shen stayed at the furnace for two days and discussed solutions with the workers. At this time, the workers saw that the engineer was being humble, and they also became active. When theory and experience were combined, solutions emerged. They found that within their own working conditions, they could remedy the various problems of the furnace.

　　The sand originally laid at the bottom of the furnace was not good, so Engineer Shen first changed the area near the iron outlet to two-thirds refractory brick powder and one-third clay, and the phenomenon of molten iron leakage disappeared. According to books, the refractory bricks of the furnace wall should be 400 mm thick, but they were originally only 300 mm thick. If it was changed to 400 mm, it would inevitably reduce the furnace's volume and affect the supply of molten iron. After discussing with Han Enping, an old worker who built furnaces, Engineer Shen drew a sketch and proposed a principle: thicken the furnace wall of the melting zone, where the heat is highest, by 30 mm. Increase the volume of the preheating zone. Once the suggestions were made, figuring out how to build these bricks was not an easy task. Engineer Shen himself was not sure. The old worker Han Enping took over this task, came up with a solution, and rebuilt the furnace. In order to solve the bridging problem, Han Enping suggested changing the slope of the tuyeres from five degrees to about twenty degrees to prevent molten iron from overflowing. After Engineer Shen adopted it, the slope of the tuyeres was increased, which was better, but molten iron could still overflow and solidify above and below the tuyeres. The bridging problem was not completely solved.

　　At this time, Wang Zhongzhang, the foreman of the forging workers, came up with a solution. Wang Zhongzhang was an old worker with 27 or 28 years of service, but his old style of work was very serious, and he often caused disunity with others. When Engineer Shen went to the furnace to operate it himself, he simply did not take responsibility. He didn't care about furnace failures either. This time, Engineer Shen humbly discussed with him and asked him for ideas. He also came up with his idea: apply a layer of refractory clay to the bricks of the tuyeres so that there are no brick seams, and the molten iron will not solidify. After doing this, the furnace air intake became smooth, and the bridging phenomenon disappeared. He also suggested that the severe erosion of the refractory bricks was closely related to the method of placing the charge. He set a method: put the coal around the outside and put the iron and limestone in the middle, which reduced the degree of erosion of the furnace wall. At this time, the ash content of the coke also decreased somewhat, so in early March, the iron smelting furnace was repaired and overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the higher authorities.

　　Until now, the furnace has been used for more than three months, and the daily iron smelting has increased from more than 50 tons in February to 80 or 90 tons. The furnace has not had any problems since. Leaving aside the fact that the iron smelting furnace is the key to the foundry department, just calculating the savings in labor by smelting more iron without having to open another furnace amounts to more than 20,000 kilograms of millet per year. This is the result of cooperation between engineers and workers. According to Engineer Shen, the furnace not only has no problems now, but even if the daily demand for molten iron increases by dozens of tons, the furnace can still handle it.

　　商商量量修好了化铁炉
    ——一个工程师和工人合作的例子
    卢念高　银重华
    石景山钢铁厂铸造部的三个八吨化铁炉，自去年六月底开炉以来，到今年二月熔铁量已由每天三十多吨，逐渐增加到五十多吨了。但是炉子也渐渐出了毛病：炉壁熔蚀得很厉害，炉壁铺的三百公厘厚的耐火砖，落炉（即停火）后，只剩下三十公厘左右，有的地方甚至只剩下五、六公厘；再严重些铁水就会流入风箱，或烧透炉壁铁板。炉子本来每天要烧十六小时，但是这时只烧到十一二小时，炉体就热得厉害，常常被迫提前停火。炉底漏铁水了。炉子风眼也不明了。有时渣子凝在风眼上，有时铁水直接流入风眼，影响送风。炉内造成挂料（即料下不下去）现象。这些毛病，一天比一天严重。但是铁水需用量却一天比一天增多。因为铸造部这时正热哄哄地要展开生产竞赛，铸管场、翻沙场，都拚命地要铁水。铸造课长兼助理工程师沈瀛洲，一面作着增产计划，一面却为这事很焦心。
    这时，工程师和工人在检讨炉子发生事故的原因时，都犯了强调客观困难的毛病。他们说：第一，炉子老了，有什么办法？第二，耐火砖质地不好；焦炭灰分太多。但是现在又没有好砖好焦炭怎办？同时因为沈工程师和工人合作不够，自己想主意，也不和工人好好商量，就亲自到炉上去操作，所以工人心里不高兴，不肯积极想办法。结果，一直没想出好办法来。
    炉子越来越坏。三月一日，挂料情形严重到用两个一吨重的大铁球往炉子里去砸。第二天，沈工程师想了想，干脆找铸管部的军代表去，对他说：“别搞增产运动了，一搞准垮！不如等修好炉子，稳稳当当地来。”军代表李文良同志这时正病在床上，就说：“不行，增产运动还是要搞，而且要按计划，在三月三日开始。”军代表告诉他：多和工人一块儿商量，叫大伙出主意；自己想出办法，最好和工人一块儿做。
    沈工程师一想：对，工人守着炉子多少年，比我经验多的多，和大家一块想办法去！
    沈工程师到炉子上守了两天，和工人一起商量办法。这时，工人看到工程师虚心了，他们也积极起来了。理论和经验一结合，办法就出来了。他们发现：在自己的工作条件内，可以补救炉子的各种毛病。
    炉底原来铺的砂不好，沈工程师首先把靠近出铁口的地方，改为三分之二的火砖粉，三分之一的粘土，于是漏铁水的现象消失了。炉壁的耐火砖，按书上所说，应该是四百公厘厚，但原来只铺了三百公厘厚。如果改成四百公厘，势必要缩小炉子的容积，影响铁水的供应。沈工程师和砌炉老工人韩恩平商量后，就画了个草图，提了个原则性的意见：把热度最高的熔化带的炉壁，加厚三十公厘。把预热带的容积加大。意见提出来了，怎样砌这些砖可不是件容易事。沈工程师自己也没有把握。老工人韩恩平就接过这个工作，想出办法，把炉子改砌好了。为了解决挂料问题，韩恩平提议把风眼的斜度由五度改成二十度左右，免得铁水上溢。经沈工程师采纳，风眼斜度加大，好是好些，但铁水还能溢出，凝在风眼上下不去。挂料问题还没有完全解决。
    这时，煅铁工领班王忠章提出办法来了。王忠章是二十七八年工龄的老工人，但是以前旧作风很严重，常和别人闹不团结。沈工程师自己到炉上去操作时，他就干脆不负责任了。炉子出了故障也不爱管。这次沈工程师虚心地和他商量，请他出主意。他的主意也拿出来了：把风眼的砖抹上一层耐火土，叫它没有砖缝，铁水就凝不住了。这样办了以后，果然炉子里进风也顺利了，挂料的现象也没有了。他并提出：耐火砖熔蚀的厉害，和摆料的方法很有关系。他定出办法：把炭摆在周围，把铁和石灰石放在中间，这样就减低了炉壁的熔蚀程度。这时焦炭的灰分正好也减低了一些，所以在三月上旬，化铁炉就装修好了，并超额完成上级所给的任务。
    直到现在，炉子又用了三个多月，每日熔铁由二月份的五十多吨提高到八九十吨，炉子再也没出过毛病。撇开化铁炉是铸造部的关键不谈，单以多化铁而不必另开炉子来计算，所节约的人工每年就合两万多斤小米。这是工程师和工人合作的结果。据沈工程师讲，炉子不只现在不出毛病了，就是铁水需用量每天再多几十吨，炉子还顶得住。
