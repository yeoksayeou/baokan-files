　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd. Xiao San, head of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Propaganda Delegation, along with delegation members Ai Qing, Zhao Zhongchi, Huang Zhensheng, and others, arrived in Xi'an on June 29th. That evening, over a thousand representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors in Northwest China held a welcoming meeting. Comrade Xiao San delivered a speech at the meeting, vehemently denouncing the US aggressors for instigating the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee to launch the Korean civil war and directly participate in the war with armed forces, as well as their illegal crime of attempting to seize Taiwan by force. He said: But US imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and isolated. The Chinese people and the people of East Asia will never be intimidated by the American bandits. The Chinese people's experience in defeating the US imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fully proves that the aggressive acts of US imperialism can be completely smashed. He called on all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the entire Northwest to resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of the 28th and to advance bravely towards liberating our own territory, Taiwan. The delegation plans to stay in Xi'an for three days to understand the progress of the peace signature campaign and conduct propaganda among various sectors to further promote the peace signature movement.

    【新华社西安二日电】中国保卫世界和平宣传团团长萧三暨团员艾青、赵仲池、黄振声等，于六月二十九日抵达西安。当晚西北各族各界代表千余人举行欢迎会。萧三团长在会上发表演讲，痛斥美国侵略者指使朝鲜卖国贼李承晚发动朝鲜内战并直接武装参加内战，及企图用武力侵占台湾的非法罪行。他说：但美帝国主义是外强中干的，孤立的，中国人民和东亚人民决不受美国强盗的恫吓。中国人民战胜美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮的经验，充分证明美帝国主义的侵略行为是完全可以粉碎的。他号召全西北各民族、各民主阶层、民主党派、人民团体坚决拥护周恩来外长二十八日的严正声明，为解放自己的国土台湾，向前奋进。该团准备在西安逗留三日，了解和平签名运动进展情况，并分别对各界进行宣传，以便更进一步的推动和平签名运动。
