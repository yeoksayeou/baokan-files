　　Review of "Principles and Methods - Fifty Years of Work Summary of Michurin"
    Translated by Zhang Zongbing, Printed by Beijing Normal University
    First Edition, May 1950

    Currently, there are many translations related to Michurin's theory and biological science. This article will discuss Zhang Zongbing's translation: "Principles and Methods - Fifty Years of Work Summary of Michurin." Why did I choose this translation for criticism? Mainly because this book is the most important part of Michurin's theory. Secondly, because this translation is done by a biologist. Therefore, I would like to bring it up for discussion with comrades engaged in the translation of Michurin's science and for readers' reference.
    The main text of the book consists of sixteen chapters and is the most important part of "Principles and Methods" in Michurin's selected works. Therefore, the editors of the selected works have summarized articles of similar nature under this major title. As the translator said, "This article is not only the longest but also discusses the principles and methods of the new genetics in the most detail."
    Let's first summarize the titles:
    Chapter 1: "Categories of Fruit Varieties in Soviet Orchards and Methods of Their Improvement" (Zhang's Translation). "果种" (Guǒ zhǒng) should be translated as "fruit tree varieties." "Fruit" refers to fruit trees, and "Varieties" should be translated as 品种 (pǐnzhǒng - varieties). "种" (Zhǒng) is another word, meaning "Species."
    Chapter 2: "The Mistake of Thinking Southern Fruit Trees Can Be Changed by Transplanting Them to the North" (Zhang's Translation). The original should be translated as: "The erroneous idea that simply transplanting southern plants can acclimatize them" (literal translation), or "The erroneous idea that southern plants can be acclimatized by simple transplantation." It is acceptable to translate "Plants" as "fruit trees." But it is not acceptable to translate "Acclimatized" as "改变" (gǎibiàn - change). This word should be translated as "acclimatize" or "artificially acclimatize" here. As for omitting "Simple" in the translation, it is even more inappropriate. Because Michurin's so-called "simple transplantation" has a special meaning.
    Chapter 5: "Distant Crossings (Interspecific Hybridization and Intertribal Hybridization), Plant Proximity Method" (Zhang's Translation). Translating "Distant Crossings" as "远交" (yuǎnjiāo - distant crossing) seems very concise, but it is better to translate it as "远缘杂交" (yuǎnyuán zájiāo - distant hybridization). As for translating "Intergeneric" as "族间" (zújiān - intertribal), it is really inappropriate. This word should be translated as "属间" (shǔjiān - intergeneric). "族" (Zú) is another word, meaning "Race." Translating "Vegetative" as "植物性" (zhíwùxìng - plant nature) is also wrong. This word should be translated as "asexual" or "nutritional" here.
    Chapter 6: "Mixed Nature of Parental Genetic Inheritance in Fruit Tree Hybrid Seedlings" (Zhang's Translation). In fact, the meaning of the original is "The mixed nature of the parental genetic traits in fruit tree hybrid seedlings." "Characters" here should be translated as "性状" (xìngzhuàng - traits). "Parental" is also better translated as "亲本的" (qīnběn de - parental).
    Chapter 10: "The Role of Education, and the Concept of Hybrid-Induced Change" (Zhang's Translation). Translating "Mentors" as "教育" (jiàoyù - education) is very inappropriate. I think this word should be translated as "conductors"—containing the meaning of "imparting" and "inducing," or transliteration may also be acceptable. "Xenia" is generally translated as "contemporary dominance" or "direct action of cross-pollination." Translating it as "杂交引变" (zájiāo yǐnbiàn - hybrid-induced change) is not good.
    Chapter 15: "Cultivating New Cold-Resistant Varieties." Translating "Breeding" as "栽培" (zāipéi - cultivate) is very problematic. This word should be translated as "育种" (yùzhǒng - breeding).
    Now let's examine the main text. Due to space limitations, I will only criticize the first four chapters. In these four chapters, there are many omissions (present in the original but not in the translation). Therefore, there are many places that are seemingly correct but not really. There are also many mistranslations. Below, I will only give a few examples.
    Page 1, first paragraph (Chapter 1), Zhang's translation is: "The government of Tsarist Russia did not care about the workers' need for fruit, and had no interest in the improvement of horticulture. For hundreds of years, they had done nothing to improve horticulture..." The original should be translated as: "The government of Tsarist Russia did not pay any attention to how to satisfy the needs of the working people for fruit, and was not interested in the development of our country's horticulture. For hundreds of years, it has not taken any measures to improve horticulture..."
    Page 1, second paragraph, Zhang's translation is: "Occasionally, a few horticulturists did some work for themselves individually. But in their work, they unfortunately went down the wrong path. They just wanted to use the good varieties that foreigners had grown well in the past to improve the varieties of fruit trees in their orchards. However, these foreign varieties were grown in warm climates and under better environmental conditions. Their characteristics, when they came to our cold continental climate, could not grow and develop normally. No matter how we use it to make it acclimatized, these foreign varieties will always fail, slowly weaken, and gradually die; with very few exceptions..." The original should be translated as "Only occasionally, some individual horticulturists automatically did some work in this regard, but unfortunately, in pursuing their goals, they went down the wrong path. They tried to completely rely on introducing the best varieties of foreign plants that had already become established into their orchards to replenish the types of their fruit trees; however, the organization of these varieties was formed in warmer places and under good climatic conditions. Once these characteristics are transferred to our relatively harsh continental climate region, they cannot grow and develop normally. Even if various well-known artificial acclimatization methods are applied, these foreign new varieties will be tormented, gradually weakened, and eventually almost inevitably die..."
    From these two paragraphs of translation, we can know that the translation and the original are quite different. In addition, it is also inappropriate to translate "replenish" as "改良" (gǎiliáng - improve), "development" as "改进" (gǎijìn - improvement), and "acclimatization" as "服水土" (fúshuǐtǔ - acclimatized).
    The translation of the entire book is mostly like this; some errors are even greater.
    Page 2, second line: "...using the socialist way of working—socialist competition and touching work—to create a new socialist horticulture..." The original should be translated as: "...adopting tried-and-tested socialist labor methods—socialist emulation and shock work—to create a new socialist horticultural enterprise..." Here, the translator actually translated "emulation" as "竞争" (jìngzhēng - competition) and "Shock work" as "感动" (gǎndòng - touching), how can this allow readers to guess its meaning?
    Page 4, tenth line (Chapter 2): "...grafting on the calyx or top branches can promote early flowering..." should be translated as: "...grafting young hybrids onto the crown can promote the advancement of the fruiting period..." The translator translated "Crown" as "花冠" (huāguān - calyx), and added the three words "or top branches." These three words are not in the original. Judging by his intention, the translator may also doubt whether the translation of "calyx" is correct, so he added "or top branches" to explain it. In fact, it is very easy to translate it as "树冠" (shùguān - crown). As for translating "fruiting" as "flowering," it is even more problematic.
    Page 4, fifteenth line: Translating "Sterile" as "不能传后代" (bùnéng chuán hòudài - cannot pass on to future generations) is not good. This word can be said to have been named, and should be translated as "不孕" (bùyùn - infertile).
    Page 5, sixth line: "...in other words: this is a plant-like hybrid." should be translated as: "...that is to say, an asexual hybrid is produced." Although the word "Vegetative hybrid" has not been named, it has generally been translated as "无性杂种" (wúxìng zázhǒng - asexual hybrid) or "营养杂种" (yíngyǎng zázhǒng - vegetative hybrid).
    Page 9, second line (Chapter 3): "...because every plant has male and female reproductive organs, every plant is fertilized by pollen to produce offspring..." should be translated as: "Every plant organism usually has male and female reproductive organs for the purpose of reproducing its offspring..." The translator not only omitted "usually," "organism" ("The word 'usually' must not be omitted, because not all plants have male and female reproductive organs."), but also translated "it Produces its offspring" as "以花粉受精生子" (yǐ huāfěn shòujīng shēngzǐ - fertilized by pollen to produce offspring).
    Page 11, nineteenth line, translating "Phenomenon of Segregation of Parent Types" as "上代性格的分离" (shàngdài xìnggé de fēnlí - separation of previous generation characteristics) is not good. It would be much better to translate it as "亲本型（或译作亲本性状）的分离现象" (qīnběn xíng (huò yì zuò qīnběn xìngzhuàng) de fēnlí xiànxiàng - separation phenomenon of parental type (or translated as parental traits)).
    Page 15, eighteenth line: "...the best and simplest propagation method is root cutting..." should be translated as: "The simplest propagation method is only layering (Rooting of layers)."
    Page 17, sixteenth line: "When selecting flowers on the mother tree for mating, it is best to use the flowers on the straight branches of the main trunk, then the fruits of the resulting hybrids will be large, and its characteristics will differ most from the maternal. Conversely, using flowers on lateral branches, the farther away from the main trunk, the smaller the fruits of the resulting hybrids will be, and its characteristics will differ most from the paternal..." The original should be translated as: "...if the selected pollinated flower is on an upright branch close to the main trunk of the mother plant, it will produce hybrids with large fruits, and the structural variation tends to the mother plant; conversely, if the pollinated flower is located on a horizontal branch around the crown, it will produce hybrids with smaller fruits, and the structural variation tends to the paternal..." In this sentence, the translator completely reversed the meaning!
    From this, it can be seen that this is not a faithful translation; and many places appear stiff and incomprehensible. Translating such important works should not be done hastily.

　　评《原理与方法——米丘林五十年工作总结》
    张宗炳译  北京师范大学印行
    一九五○年五月初版
    叶笃义
    目前有关米丘林学说和生物科学的翻译很多。本文要谈的是张宗炳译的：《原理与方法——米丘林五十年工作总结》。为什么我选择了这本译作来进行批评呢？主要因为这本书是米丘林学说中最重要的一部分。其次因为这一译本又出于生物学者之手。所以特别先提出来与从事米丘林科学翻译的同志们商讨，并供读者参考。
    该书正文共十六章，是米丘林选集中《原理和方法》最重要的一部分。所以选集的编者把性质相近的文章都归纳在这一个大标题之下。正如译者所说，“这篇不但最长，而且对于新遗传学的原理与方法讨论得最为详尽”。
    先把题目摘要说一说：
    第一章  《苏联果园内果种之类别及其改良之方法》（张译）。“果种”应译为“果树品种”。“Fruit”系指果树而言，而“Varieties”应译为品种。“种”是另外一个字，为“Species”。
    第二章  “南方果树移植北方可以改变之观点的错误”（张译）。原文应译作：“简单移植南方植物可以使它们驯化的错误观念”（直译），亦可译为“用简单移植法可以驯化南方植物的错误观念”。把“Plants”译为“果树”尚无不可。但把“Acclimatized”译为“改变”是不可以的。这个字在这里无论如何也要译为“驯化”或“人为驯化”。至于把“简单”（Simple）省去不译，更不应当。因为米丘林所谓“简单移植”，是有着特殊的意义的。
    第五章  “远交（种间杂交及族间杂交），植物性接近法”（张译）。把“Distant Crossings”译为“远交”似乎很简炼，其实还是把它译为“远缘杂交”好一点。至于把“Intergeneric”译为“族间”实在不妥当。这个字应译为“属间”。“族”是另外一个字，为“Race”。把“Vegetative”译为“植物性”也错了。这个字在这里应译为“无性的”或“营养的”。
    第六章  “果树杂种苗木内亲性格遗传之混合性”（张译）。其实原文的意思为“亲本的遗传性状在果树杂种苗木内之混合的性质”。“Charactcrs”在这里似应译为“性状”。“Parental”也以译作“亲本的”为佳。
    第十章  “教育的作用，与杂交引变的概念”（张译）。把“Menters”译作“教育”很不妥。我认为这个字应当译为“传导者”—含有“传授”和“诱导”的意思，或者音译也未尝不可。“Xenia”一般均译成“当代显性”，或译作“异花授粉的直接作用”。译作“杂交引变”是不好的。
    第十五章  “栽培新的抗寒品种”。把“Breeding”译为“栽培”很有毛病。这个字应译为“育种”。
    现在我们再检查一下正文。限于篇幅的关系，我只对前四章加以批评。在这四章里，漏译（原文有，译文中未见）的地方多得很。因此似是而非的地方很多。误译的地方也不少。在下面，我只举出几个例子。
    第一页的第一段（第一章），张译为：“俄国沙皇时代的政府对于工人的水果之需要全不关心，对于园艺学的改进也全无兴趣，几百年来对于园艺学的改进一无建树，……”。原文应译作：“帝俄沙皇政府毫未注意如何满足劳动人民在水果方面的需要，对于我国园艺事业的发展也没有什么兴趣。几百年来对于园艺的改进没有作过任何处理……”。
    第一页第二段，张译为：“偶而，有几个园艺学家自己单独地为了他们自己做些工作。可是在工作中，他们不幸走的是错路。他们只是想拿国外人家已往长好的好种来改良他们果园内果树的种类。但是，这些外来的果种，都是暖和的气候下，及较为环境优好的情形下长成的。它们的性格，到了我们这严寒大陆气候的地区来，便不能正常的生长与发育了。无论我们怎样的运用使它服水土，这些外来的种总是不成，慢慢的消瘦，而渐至于死亡；除了很少的例外。……”。原文却应译作“只是偶然地，有些个别的园艺家自动地在这方面作了一点工作，但不幸在追求他们的目的时，他们走错了路。他们试图完全依靠引进那些已经成为定型的外国最好品种的植株到他们的果园内，以充实他们的果树品种的种类；但是这些品种的组织是在比较温暖的地方、良好的气候条件之下所形成的。这些性质，一经移到我们比较严酷的大陆性气候的地区之后，便不能正常地成长和发育。纵使应用各种声名卓著的人为驯化方法，这些外来的新品种也要受到折磨，逐渐衰弱，最后几乎很少例外地都难免于死亡。……”
    从这两段译文中，我们可以知道，译文与原文颇有出入。此外，如把“replcnish”译为“改良”，把“developmant”译为“改进”，把“acclimatization”译为“服水土”等，也不妥当。
    全书的译文大都如此；有几处错误还要大些。
    第二页第二行：“……用社会主义的工作方式—社会主义竞争及感动工作来创立一个新的社会主义的园艺学……”。原文应译作：“……采用久经考验过的社会主义劳动方法——社会主义竞赛和突击，以创造一个新的社会主义园艺事业。……”。这里译者竟把“emulation”译为“竞争”，把“Shock work”译为“感动”了，这如何能让读者猜想出它的意义？
    第四页第十行（第二章）：“……把接枝接在花冠或顶枝上可以促使早开花，……”，应译为：“……把幼龄杂种嫁接在树冠上可以促使它结果时期的提早，……”。译者把“Crown”译为“花冠”，又加上“或顶枝”三个字。这三个字在原文中没有。窥其用意，译者恐也怀疑“花冠”的翻译是否正确，所以加上“或顶枝”以资说明。其实把它译为“树冠”是很现成的。至于把“结果”译成“开花”，就更有问题了。
    第四页第十五行：把“Steriie”译为“不能传后代”，是不好的。这个字可说已经定名，应当译为“不孕”。
    第五页第六行：“……换句话说：这便是一个植物性的杂种。”，应译为：“………也就是说，产生了一个无性杂种。”“Vegetatine hybrid”一字虽未定名，但一般已把它译为“无性杂种”或“营养杂种”了。
    第九页第二行  （第三章）：“………因为每一植物都有雌雄的生殖器，每一植物都以花粉受精生子。………”，应译为：“每一植物有机体通常都具有雌雄生殖器官，作为繁殖其后代之用，………”译者不但漏译了“通常”，“有机体”（“通常”二字决不可不译，因为并不见得所有的植物都具有雌雄生殖器官。”，而且竟把“it Produces its offspring”译作“以花粉受精生子”。
    第十一页第十九行，把“Phenomenon of Segregation of Parent Types”译作“上代性格的分离”，是不好的。如译作“亲本型（或译作亲本性状）的分离现象”就好得多了。
    第十五页第十八行：“……最好而简单的繁殖法便是插根，…”，应译作：“最简单的繁殖方法只有压条生根法（Rooting of Iayers）。”
    第十七页第十六行：“在选择母树上的花朵作交配时，最好用主干直枝上的花，那么所得杂种的果实就大，而它的性格与母性相差最大。相反的，用横枝上的花，离开主干越远，所得杂种的果实就小，而它的性格与父性差最大，……”。原文应译作：“……假使选择被授粉的花是在靠近母本主干的直立枝上，则会产生大果实的杂种，其构造上的变异有倾向于母本的趋势；相反的，假使被授粉的花位在树冠周围的水平枝上，则会产生较小果实的杂种，其构造上的变异即倾向于父本。……”在这一句话里，译者竟把意思完全弄得相反了！
    由此可见，这是一个不够忠实的译本；并且许多地方都显得译笔生硬，令人难解。翻译这样重要的著作是不应草率从事的。
