　　The Entire Command and Soldiers of a Certain Army Stationed in North China
    Send a Telegram of Condolences to the Korean People's Army
    Resolving to Support Them by Liberating Taiwan
    [This Newspaper Despatch] The entire command and soldiers of a certain army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in North China, held a meeting on the 7th of this month to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and sent a telegram to the entire officers and men of the Korean People's Army to express their respect. The telegram stated: You are already standing at the forefront of defending world peace, eliminating and defeating the puppet troops of the American imperialist lackey Syngman Rhee and the American aggressors. Your glorious achievements show that you are worthy of being heroic sons and daughters of the Korean people. Although the shameless intensification of aggression by imperialism may increase some difficulties for you, we believe that the final victory will surely belong to you and to the people of Korea. The telegram concluded: "Your close comrades-in-arms—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—will certainly use the great victory of liberating Taiwan to practically support you!"
