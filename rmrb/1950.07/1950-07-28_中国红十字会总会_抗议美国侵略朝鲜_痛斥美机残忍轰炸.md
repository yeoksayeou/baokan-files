Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Chinese Red Cross Society has issued a statement strongly protesting the American imperialists' armed aggression and indiscriminate bombing of the Korean people. The statement said: After the American imperialists and their running dog Syngman Rhee suffered setbacks in their armed attack on the Korean people, they became enraged and dispatched large numbers of air force planes to carry out blind and cruel bombing of Korean civilians. The American imperialists' aggressive acts undoubtedly violate the United Nations Charter; and this kind of beastly bombing is a contempt for the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Civilians in Wartime of December 8, 1949. We, the Chinese Red Cross Society, on behalf of the 380,000 members of China, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and strongly protest the criminal acts of American imperialism. We call on the members of the Red Cross in the United States and other countries to unite the people of their countries and rise up together to fight to stop the American imperialists' aggression and atrocities against the Korean people!

    抗议美国侵略朝鲜  痛斥美机残忍轰炸
    【新华社二十六日讯】中国红十字会总会顷发表声明，对美帝国主义武装侵略和滥炸朝鲜人民提出严重抗议。声明称：美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚在武装进攻朝鲜人民遭受挫败后，恼羞成怒，大量出动空军，对朝鲜平民施以盲目残忍的轰炸。美帝国主义的侵略行为，无疑地是破坏了联合国宪章；而这种兽性轰炸，更是蔑视一九四九年十二月八日的日内瓦战时平民保护公约。我们中国红十字会总会特代表中国的三十八万会员，坚决地拥护我国周外长的声明，并严重抗议美帝国主义的犯罪行为。我们号召美国和其他各国的红十字会会员，团结本国人民，一致奋起，为制止美帝国主义者对朝鲜人民的侵略与暴行而奋斗！
