　　A Letter from Farmers in Luoquanjia Village, Kuandian County, to Chairman Mao
　　·Song Xu·
　　On the afternoon of the Dragon Boat Festival – June 19th, the fifth village people's representative meeting was held in Luoquanjia Village, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, Northeast China. The village government house was packed with people's representatives. In the previous four representative meetings, the representatives also spoke enthusiastically, but there was never such excitement and joy as this time. The laughter was never as loud, and the expressions were never as moving. Because at this meeting, the representatives were going to write a letter to their beloved leader Chairman Mao, on the one hand, to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party and congratulate the Communist Party; on the other hand, to report to Chairman Mao on the production and living conditions after the land reform. The old man sitting on the north kang smiled in a daze, stroking his beard, as if he was recalling something; the middle-aged man on the ground paced back and forth, reporting how life had improved; the young people squatting on the threshold jumped up and down, just laughing, sometimes interjecting in the chaotic and pleasant noise, "We have got the opportunity to study," "I can already recognize more than 300 characters," "I can keep accounts and write simple letters now." A young female representative sitting on the south kang whispered, as if afraid of being heard, "Now we can find 'partners' ourselves, why not write it down!" After saying that, a blush appeared on her face.
　　The person in charge of drafting整理了代表们的发言，写了下面这封信:Dear Chairman Mao:
　　Our village is the most remote village in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province. There are high mountains and many rocks, and the geological conditions are very bad. People often say, "This is a place where even rabbits don't shit." How many acres of these lands did we have in the past? There are 152 households in the village, with 2,511 acres of land, and 11 landlords and rich peasants occupy more than 1,000 acres. Even with these barren lands, our ancestors dreamed of: "One day, we can have three to five acres of land, and we can cultivate on our own land. How happy that would be!"
　　Chairman Mao – our dearest leader, our ideal has now been realized, because at the end of 1947, our village completed the land reform. In the past, we worked on other people's land, but now we work on our own land; in the past, we carried rice bowls on our shoulders for the landlords, but now the fruits of our labor are entirely for ourselves. How can our enthusiasm for production not be great? How can our lives not improve quickly? Look, dear Chairman Mao: The land yield has exceeded that of 1942. In 1942, each mu of land could only produce an average of 230 jin, but last year each mu produced more than 300 jin. Last year, after deducting the annual expenses and public grain, the whole village had a surplus of more than 100,000 jin of grain.
　　In the past, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the children of the landlords wore colorful clothes and wandered around the streets. But our children only clipped a branch on their ears to indicate that it was the Dragon Boat Festival. But the children didn't understand, they saw the landlords' children dressed neatly, and they ran home crying and making noise: "Dad, I want new clothes!" "Mom, I want eggs!" "Grandma, I want to eat zongzi!" "We can't even wear broken clothes, where can we get new clothes!" The parents impatiently slapped the children's buttocks twice; the children cried and ran, and even after running seventy or eighty steps, we could still hear them mumbling: "...new clothes...eggs...zongzi...." How sad we were. Today? Our children are also wearing red and green clothes, jumping around the streets. Although it is still drizzling, they are singing everywhere: "The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong...." "...The Communist Party's kindness cannot be expressed enough...."
　　Take a look at the houses we live in. Before the land reform, the houses we lived in were not even as good as the landlords' stables. We had to bend over when going out and lower our heads when entering the door. We called it "two bows when going out." Now we have moved into the houses we built ourselves. But the houses are still not enough to live in, so we have built 74 new rooms. The houses that were distributed during the land reform have also been mostly repaired.
　　Wang Minglian in our village often says: "Before the land reform, the only four-legged thing in my house was a small bench, and the only hairy thing was a mouse. Now, there is a cow and a donkey tied in the stable." Every time he finishes this sentence, he laughs for a while, and then adds, "Look, if we live for another five years, we will definitely have herds of mules and horses." Indeed, in our village, there were only more than 80 head of livestock during the land reform, but now it has increased to more than 180 head; each farmer has at least one head. During the land reform, Tang Deming in our village only received one cow, but now he is raising three cows and a donkey.
　　Dear Chairman Mao, on the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, please accept our gift – an increase of 70 percent in the village's output compared to the normal year. How did we increase production? We further discussed it at this people's representative meeting. From now until the end of the growing season, we will mainly do three things: First, start hoeing and weeding for the second time from now on, and ensure the completion of three hoeings and three weedings; Second, apply top dressing to the crops. We have now prepared more than 300 carts of chicken manure and pig manure; Third, build dams.
　　Oh, there is one more thing I forgot to tell you. Chairman Mao, only three households of military dependents in our village without labor force did not participate in the mutual aid group – their land is all cultivated by us on their behalf, and the rest have all participated in the mutual aid group. In organizing labor mutual aid, we have learned that this is "the only way from poverty to prosperity." Take the Han Jinhua mutual aid group in our village as an example. This is a first-class model mutual aid group in our Liaodong Province and the first one organized in our village. Their group's life has improved faster than ours. From last year to now, they have earned 30 million yuan from sideline occupations alone. We organized because we saw the benefits their group got.
　　In commemorating the 29th anniversary of the founding of our savior – the Communist Party – we shout:
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!
　　Wish Chairman Mao good health!
　　All the People's Representatives of the First People's Congress of Luoquanjia Village, Bahechuan District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province
　　June 19th
　　Before the person in charge of drafting finished writing this letter and read it to everyone, Zhang Zuyue, a 39-year-old female representative, suddenly stood up from the kang, "Send a greeting to Chairman Mao for me." After saying that, she sat down again, looking at this one and that one. "Also, write it down for me again." Zhang Zuyue thought for a while and then continued: "I also want to report my production achievements to Chairman Mao, so that Chairman Mao can see whether I, a Communist Party member, have played a model role. Since I joined the mutual aid group last year, I have used the money I earned from production to buy four sets of clothes, a donkey, a cow, and a pig in one year."

### 宽甸县罗圈夹村农民给毛主席写的一封信

　　宽甸县罗圈夹村农民给毛主席写的一封信
    ·宋旭·
    端午节——六月十九日的下午，东北辽东省宽甸县罗圈夹村召开第五次村人民代表大会，村政府的屋子里挤满了人民代表。以往的四次代表会，代表们也热烈地发言；但是却没有像这次这样的兴奋、欢喜。笑声没有像这次这样响亮，表情没有像这次这样动人。因为代表们要在这次会上向敬爱的领袖毛主席写一封信，一方面为庆祝共产党诞生二十九周年，向共产党祝贺；另一方面向毛主席报告报告他们在土地改革以后生产和生活的状况。坐在北炕上的老年人，出神地在摸着胡须微笑，好像在回忆；在地下的壮年踱来踱去，在报告生活是怎样改善的；蹲在门坎上的青年们，蹦上蹦下地只是哈哈着笑，有时在杂乱而愉快的吵吵声中插上几句“我们得到了学习的机会”，“我现在已经识三百多字了”，“我记个账写个简单信都行啦”。坐在南炕上的一位青年妇女代表，小声地好像怕被别人听见似地插上一句：“现在能自己找‘对象’啦，为什么不写上！”说完后脸上浮现一层红晕。
    执笔人整理了代表们的发言，写了下面这封信：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们的村子是辽东省宽甸县最偏僻的一个村，山高石头多，地质很坏，别人常说：“这是兔子不拉屎的地方”。就是这些地，过去在我们手里又有几亩呢？全村共一百五十二户，二千五百一十一亩地，十一户地主富农就占去了一千多亩。就是这些薄地，我们的祖祖辈辈都是做梦也在想着：“有一天自己能有个三亩五亩的地，能在自己的土地上耕种，那有多么高兴啊！”
    毛主席——最亲爱的领袖，我们这个理想现在实现了，因为在一九四七年年底，我们村里完成了土地改革。过去我们是在别人的土地上出力，现在是在自己的土地上劳动；过去是一个肩给地主扛着饭碗，现在劳动果实完全为自己所得了。这样，我们生产的劲头怎能不大呢？我们生活上升的怎能慢呢？你看看吧，亲爱的毛主席：土地产量已经超过了一九四二年。在一九四二年，每亩地平均只能产二百三十斤，去年每亩地产了三百多斤。去年除了全年的花费和公粮，全村剩余了十万多斤粮食。
    往常过端午节，地主家的孩子穿的花花绿绿，满街上游游荡荡的。咱的孩子呢，只是在耳朵上夹上块树枝，表示着这是过端午节了。可是孩子们不懂事啊，他们看到地主家的孩子们穿的整整齐齐的，就哭着脸跑来家乱吵乱闹：“爸，我要新衣服！”“妈，我要鸡蛋！”“奶奶，我要吃粽子！”。“连破衣服还穿不上，那来的新衣服！”作父母的不耐烦的就在孩子的屁股上打两下；孩子一面哭一面跑，跑出七、八十步去还听到孩子的嘴里咕念着：“……新衣服……鸡蛋……粽子……。”咱心里多么难过。今天呢？咱的孩子们也是穿的红红绿绿的满街上蹦蹦跳跳，虽然天还在下着毛毛雨，他们却到处在唱着：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……。”“……共产党的恩情说不完……。”
    您再看看我们住的房子。在土地改革前，我们住的房子连地主家的牲口棚都不如，出门要弯着腰，进门要低着头，我们把它叫做“出门两个礼”。现在我们已经搬进我们自己盖的房子了。可是房子还是不够住的，我们又新盖了七十四间。在土地改革时分到的房子，也大部分修理过了。
    我村王明连常说：“土地改革以前，我家里四条腿的是小板凳，带毛的是耗子。现在呢，牲口棚里栓着一头牛、一条驴了。”每当他说完这句话，都是嘻嘻咧咧的笑一阵后，又加上一句：“看吧，再住五年，一定叫它骡马成群。”的确是这样，我们村里在土地改革时只有八十多头牲口，现在已增加到一百八十多头；每户农民至少有一头。在土地改革时，我村唐德明只分到了一头牛，现在已经养着三头牛、一条驴。
    敬爱的毛主席，在中国共产党诞生二十九周年的今天，请您接受我们的礼物——全村较常年产量增产百分之七十。怎样增产呢？我们在这次人民代表大会上又进一步的讨论了一下，从现在到挂锄，主要要做三件事：第一、从现在起开始铲趟二遍，保证完成三铲三趟；第二、给庄稼上追肥，我们现在已准备好三百多车鸡粪和猪圈粪；第三、打坝。
    噢，还有一个事忘了告诉您。毛主席，我们全村只有三户没有劳动力的军属没参加互助组——他们的土地全由我们代耕，其余的全参加了互助组。在组织劳动互助当中，我们体会到：这是“由贫困到富裕的必由之路”。拿我村韩金华互助组来说吧，这是我们辽东省的一等模范互助组，是我们村里第一个先组织起来的。他们组里的生活就比我们的生活上升的快。他们从去年到现在，光搞副业就挣了三千万元。我们就是看到他们组里得了好处才组织起来的。
    在纪念我们的救星——共产党——诞生二十九周年的时候，我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    祝毛主席身体健康！
    辽东省宽甸县八河川区罗圈夹村第一届人民代表大会全体人民代表
    六月十九日
    执笔的人写完这封信后，还没有念给大家听。三十九岁的妇女代表张祖悦忽的从炕上站起来，“给我捎上一句，就说我问毛主席个好。”说完了后，又重坐下来，看看这个，望望那个。“还有，再给我写上。”张祖悦寻思了一会又接着说：“我还要把我生产的成绩报告给毛主席呢，好叫毛主席看看我这个共产党员起没起到模范作用。我打去年参加互助组，一年中用我自己生产的钱，买了四套衣服，一条驴，一头牛和一口猪。”【新华社沈阳七日电】
