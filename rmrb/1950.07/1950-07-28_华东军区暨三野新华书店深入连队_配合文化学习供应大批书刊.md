　　East China Military Region and 3rd Field Army Xinhua Bookstore Deeply Penetrate Companies to Supply Large Quantities of Books and Periodicals in Coordination with Cultural Learning

　　[Xinhua News Agency News] Over the past six months, the Xinhua Bookstore attached to the People's Liberation Army East China Military Region and the Third Field Army (also serving as a library) has deeply penetrated companies, powerfully supporting the increasingly developing cultural learning of the troops.

　　The East China Military Region held a military-wide publishing work conference in December of last year. Since then, in order to meet the growing demands of the troops for cultural learning, each unit has universally established mobile bookstores. Currently, under the leadership of the military region and the Third Field Army mobile branch bookstores, the entire army has seven central branch stores, twenty-seven branch stores, one hundred and eighty-four sales agencies, and many small company libraries. The libraries of the central branch stores and branch stores average more than 2,000 books, while the libraries of divisions, regiments, and companies average about 500 books.

　　The mobile bookstores of each unit closely cooperated with the learning needs of the commanders and fighters, and supplied a large number of popular readings, theoretical books, and cultural and educational supplies. A certain division's sales agency distributed more than 14,000 popular readings within a month and sold 1,080 fountain pens. The bookstore of the East China Military and Political University, in coordination with the school's study of the history of social development and the problems of the Chinese revolution, distributed more than 20,000 related reference books in three months, accounting for 65% of the total distribution. The bookstores of each unit also cooperated with national political events, major festivals, and military and political tasks of the troops to organize inexpensive days or weeks, focusing on supplying the books that commanders and fighters urgently needed to read, and organized large-scale book and newspaper photo exhibitions. Over the past six months, the mobile branch store has also published a total of twelve kinds of reading materials to assist commanders and fighters in their studies, most of which were poems, clappers, and scripts created by the commanders and fighters themselves, with a total distribution of 400,000 copies. These books were welcomed by the majority of commanders and fighters.

　　The staff of the bookstores in each unit, under the guidance of the working principle of penetrating into companies to serve the soldiers, showed a spirit of hard work and simplicity. They often carefully selected books related to the current military and political tasks of the troops and introduced them to the commanders and fighters for reading or purchase. Some carried book loads, and some carried cloth bags full of books, to carry out business in various companies. According to statistics from a sales agency of a certain division, over the past six months, the sales agency went to companies more than 190 times, distributed 20,000 books, and had more than 35,000 readers. The bookstore staff often went deep into platoons and squads to organize soldiers to read, explain the contents of books, help them learn to read and write, organize them to discuss, and help them solve difficulties in their studies, which powerfully promoted the enthusiasm of the troops for cultural learning. Before the liberation of Zhoushan, the staff of a bookstore in a certain unit often took small boats full of books and stationery, braving the danger of enemy aircraft and naval vessels to attack the islands where the troops were stationed. Within three months, they distributed more than 6,800 books, sold more than 1,000 pieces of stationery, and assisted the troops on the island in establishing more than a dozen small libraries.

　　The operating principle of the mobile branch store is "unified leadership by the branch store, decentralized operation by the branch stores." That is, the bookstores of each unit establish business relations with local branch stores in terms of procurement and distribution, and each determines the quantity and content of procurement according to the needs of the troops. This can make the business of each branch store more closely integrated with the needs of the majority of commanders and fighters, and make the distribution of books fast and timely, so as to suit the scattered situation of the troops. The business policy of the branch store is "basic price to maintain capital," the purpose of which is to enable the bookstores of each unit to maintain their original capital and business scope, and to serve the commanders and fighters of the troops for a long time. Various work rules and regulations have been formulated within the bookstores of each unit to strengthen the business study of cadres in service; some units have also opened training courses to prepare for the coming climax of larger-scale cultural learning in the troops.

　　During this period, the bookstores of each unit also had the following main shortcomings: a few branch stores lacked planning and strong guidance in the popularization organization, and simply paid attention to the expansion of the organization while neglecting its soundness and consolidation. Some individual bookstores still had the waiting mentality of "talk about it after the war is over," and did not start work well in a timely manner. A few branch stores neglected political tasks in their operations and simply pursued profits. A few branch stores emphasized decentralized operations and neglected unified leadership, which resulted in some disorganized and undisciplined phenomena. These shortcomings have been reviewed and are being overcome.

### 华东军区暨三野新华书店深入连队  配合文化学习供应大批书刊

　　华东军区暨三野新华书店深入连队
    配合文化学习供应大批书刊
    【新华社讯】人民解放军华东军区暨第三野战军各部新华书店随军书店（兼图书馆）半年来深入连队，有力地配合了日益开展的部队的文化学习。
    华东军区曾于去年十二月举行了全军出版工作会议。自那时以后，各部为配合部队日益高涨的文化学习的要求，既普遍设立了随军书店。现全军在军区和第三野战军随军分店领导下，共有七个中心支店、二十七个支店、一百八十四个代销处和很多的连队小型图书室。中心支店和支店的图书馆平均有书籍二千册以上，师、团单位和连队的图书馆平均有书籍五百册左右。
    各部随军书店密切配合着指战员们学习的需要，大量供应了通俗读物、理论书籍和文化教育用具。某师代销处一个月内发行通俗读物即达一万四千余册，售出自来水笔一千零八十支。华东军政大学的书店配合全校社会发展史和中国革命问题的学习，三个月内共发行有关参考书籍二万余册，占发行总数百分之六十五。各部书店并多次配合全国性政治事件、重大节日和部队军政任务，兴办了廉价日或廉价周，有重点地供应了指战员们急需阅读的书籍，并兴办了大规模的书报图片展览。随军分店半年来并出版了辅助指战员们学习的读物共十二种，其中大部分是指战员们自已创作的诗、快板和剧本，共已发行四十万册。这些书籍都受到广大指战员们的欢迎。
    各部书店工作人员在贯彻深入连队为战士服务的工作方针下，都表现了艰苦朴实的工作作风。他们经常仔细地选择结合部队当前军政任务的书籍，介绍给指战员们阅读或购买。有的挑着书担子，有的背着装满了图书的布袋，分别到各个连队去开展业务。据某师代销处统计，半年来该代销处共下连队一百九十余次，发行书籍二万册，阅览人数三万五千余人。书店的工作人员经常深入到班、排去组织战士们阅读，讲解书籍内容，帮助他们识字、写字，组织他们讨论，帮助他们解决学习中的困难，有力地推动了部队文化学习的热情。在舟山解放前，某部书店工作人员们经常乘着满载书籍和文具的小船，冒着敌人飞机、兵艇袭击的危险到各部所驻的海岛上去。三个月内共发行书籍六千八百余册，卖出文具千余件，并协助岛上部队建立了十余个小型图书室。
    随军分店的经营方针是“分店统一领导，支店分散经营”。即由各部书店在采购和发行方面分别与各地分支店建立业务关系，各自根据部队需要确定采购的数量与内容。这样即可使各部支店的业务与广大指战员的需要更密切地结合，并使书籍的发行迅速、及时，以适合于部队分散的情况。分店在营业上的方针是“基价保本”，其目的是使各部书店能够保持原有的资力与营业范围，能够长期地为部队指战员们服务。各部书店内部并制订了各种工作条与例制度，加强了在职干部的业务学习；有的单位并开办了训练班，为配合将来更大规模的部队文化学习的高潮做好准备工作。
    各部书店在这个期间还存在着下列几个主要缺点：少数支店在普及组织上缺乏计划性与有力的指导，单纯注意了组织的扩大而忽视了它的健全与巩固。个别书店还存在着“打完仗再说”的等待思想，没有很好地及时展开工作。个别支店在经营中忽视政治任务，单纯追求盈利。少数支店因强调分散经营、而忽视统一领导，而产生了某些无组织无纪律的现象。这些缺点都已进行检讨，正在加以克服中。
