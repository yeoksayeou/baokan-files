Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 28th: The Korean Central News Agency, Seoul, July 25th: With the demise of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, members of the South Korean puppet “National Assembly” have confessed one after another, repudiating their past crimes and issuing statements opposing the aggression of US imperialism and the traitorous acts of the Syngman Rhee clique. On July 25th, former “National Assembly” Vice-Speaker Yoon Ki-seop, Socialist Party leader Cho So-ang, National Self-Reliance Alliance Vice-Chairman Won Se-hoon, former US Military Government Civil Administrator Ahn Jae-hong, and 44 other puppet “National Assembly” members held a meeting. The participants unanimously expressed their opposition to the bestial atrocities of US imperialism, which, after suffering defeats on the front lines, blindly bombed peaceful cities and villages in the rear, slaughtering innocent people. They also passed a resolution calling on other “National Assembly” members who had not yet surrendered not to miss the opportunity to break away from the Syngman Rhee bandit gang as soon as possible and stand on the side of the people.
The participants unanimously expressed their denial and opposition to the so-called "Republic of Korea," "National Assembly," and puppet "government" fabricated by the Americans, actively supported the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and participated in the struggle against US imperialism and the remaining Syngman Rhee bandits.
