　　Hegang Mining Bureau's Nanshan Mine Improves Democratic Management Work
    The Mine's Experience is Now Being Gradually Promoted Throughout the Bureau
    [Our Newspaper Hegang News] Nanshan Mine, under the Northeast Hegang Coal Mine Mining Bureau, with the help of Chen Gengfu, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Coal Mine Trade Union, focused on studying and improving democratic management in April this year, gaining initial experience which is now being promoted throughout the bureau.
    From March of last year to January of this year, Hegang Coal Mine successively established management committees and employee representative conferences at all levels—pit (factory), mine, and bureau—in twenty-eight units, but there was a serious tendency towards formalism. To address this, Chen Gengfu, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Coal Mine Trade Union, personally conducted a key experiment in Nanshan Mine. He started by having the leadership study documents and conduct self-criticism to open up their thinking. For example, Chen Yanqin, Deputy Pit Leader of the mine's 12th Pit, was capable in his work but very subjective, his style was undemocratic, and he didn’t delegate work. He was constantly busy, even to the point of spitting blood from exhaustion, but still failed to complete production tasks and couldn't improve attendance rates. After studying the documents, he began to recognize the importance of democratic management and made a deep self-examination of his past shortcomings. As a result, relations between cadres began to improve, and their understanding of the masses also changed. On this basis, they proceeded to reverse the erroneous notion held by administrative cadres and technicians that workers could not manage mines or formulate plans, clarifying that the management committee should focus on discussing and resolving key issues in production. For example, the Sixth Pit's Third Inclined Shaft is currently working on mechanized coal mining, with the administration proactively collecting workers' opinions and seeking assistance from the trade union to enhance workers' confidence in managing the mine. The mine's experience proves that administrative cadre representatives in the management committee should not exceed half of the total number, meetings should be held regularly, all members should be notified in advance to prepare thoroughly, the focus should be on discussing key issues in production, meetings should not be too long, democracy should be promoted at the meeting, worker representatives should be encouraged to speak up, and cadres should avoid dominating the discussion.
    Currently, the experience of Nanshan Mine is being promoted throughout the bureau, and democratic management is being implemented as a campaign throughout the bureau.

　　鹤岗矿务局南山矿改进民主管理工作
    该矿经验现正逐步推广全局
    【本报鹤岗讯】东北鹤岗煤矿矿务局所属南山矿，今年四月在东北煤矿总工会副主席陈耕夫帮助下，重点研究并改进了民主管理工作，获得了初步经验，现正向全局推广中。
    鹤岗煤矿从去年三月到今年一月，先后在二十八个单位建立起坑（厂）、矿、局各级管理委员会和职工代表会，但严重的存在着形式主义的偏向。为此，东北煤矿总工会副主席陈耕夫亲自在南山矿作重点试验。首先从学习文件、展开自我批评打通领导思想入手。如该矿十二坑副坑长陈延勤工作能力较强，但非常主观，作风不民主，工作不放手，自己忙来忙去，甚至累得吐血，结果却不能完成生产任务，出勤率也提不高。经过学习文件，他开始认识了民主管理的重要，针对过去的缺点，作了深切的自我检讨。因此干部之间的关系开始改善，对群众的认识也有了不同。在这一基础上，继之扭转行政干部和技术人员认为工人不会管理矿山和制订计划的错误认识，明确了管委会应着重讨论和解决生产上的主要问题。如六坑三斜正在搞机械化采煤，行政主动搜集工人意见，并找工会协助工作，借以提高工人管理矿山的信心。该矿经验证明：在管委会内行政干部代表不能超过半数以上，会议要定期召开，会前应通知各委员作充分准备，应着重讨论生产上的主要问题，开会时间不宜过长，会上要发扬民主，启发工人代表发言，避免干部包办。
    目前南山矿的经验正在向全局推广，民主管理正被当作一个运动在全局推行。
