The Yixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Instructs Party Cadres to Correct Deviations in the Summer Grain Tax Collection in a Timely Manner

[Report from this newspaper] The summer grain tax collection work in Yixian County, Hebei Province, has entered the stage of allocation to households. According to reports from cadres in the first, second, and fifth districts of the county, there are deviations of coercion and unfair burden in the allocation of tasks from the village to the households. The facts are as follows: (1) Some cadres mistakenly feared that the masses would understand the policy, and did not truthfully report the number of mu of wheat fields and yields. As a result, they did not publicize the policy to the masses, but instead held meetings in groups to conduct investigations from the side, and then convened mass meetings for self-reporting and mutual comparison. Those who did not report truthfully were questioned. As a result, a phenomenon of being detached from the masses was formed. (2) Some Party member cadres mistakenly believed that it would be difficult to handle matters with the participation of the masses in the representatives. Others believed that the representative meeting would not play any role, so they dared not hold representative meetings. When allocating tasks, many villages only had a few cadres meeting to discuss and estimate the allocation by household, and then convened mass meetings to let the masses acknowledge themselves. When the acknowledged amount did not reach the amount estimated by the cadres, they were forced to re-acknowledge. Some village cadres, afraid of trouble, allocated the task equally by household according to the number of mu of wheat fields. (3) Some villages found that village cadres and representatives had lighter burdens, while the masses had heavier burdens. For example, in Xigao Village, Second District, Yi Lojun (a member of the masses) had a family of six, cultivated thirteen mu of land (including 1.8 mu of paddy fields), planted wheat on five mu, and actually produced 500 jin of wheat. This time, he was burdened with 70 jin of wheat. Village head Wang Shengcai had a family of seven, cultivated fifteen mu of land (including one mu of garden land), planted wheat on 4.5 mu, and actually produced 450 jin of wheat. This time, he was burdened with only 30 jin. Representative Yi Lole planted wheat on three mu and was allocated only 10 jin. This kind of unbalanced burden has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses.

After discovering these deviations, the Yixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent instruction on July 6, requiring cadres at all levels of the Party to correct them in a timely manner. The instruction proposed: (1) Conscientiously implement the summer grain tax collection policy and conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization. First of all, ideological alignment must be achieved within the Party, and then the People's Representative Meeting must be held well, and the spirit of democracy must be promoted. Strive to allocate to households around the 10th. (2) Allocation to households is the central link in taking the mass line in the summer grain tax collection, and it is also a manifestation of whether the policy is correctly implemented. County and district cadres must effectively grasp the central link in the summer grain tax collection. Overcome the simple task viewpoint and coercive command style in mobilizing the masses. (3) After the task is allocated to households, the quality of wheat should be grasped; the transportation work should be well organized to ensure the smooth completion of warehousing. (4) Overcome the past shortcomings of only arranging but not inspecting work; after the task of wheat collection is assigned to households in each district, in-depth inspections should be carried out, and errors should be discovered and corrected immediately. (5) Overcome the problem of working in isolation in the past; in the wheat collection, we must firmly grasp the work of weeding, protecting seedlings, preventing floods, and releasing silt.

　　中共易县县委指示党的干部
    及时纠正夏征偏向
    【本报讯】河北省易县的夏征工作已进入向户分配的阶段。据该县一、二、五区干部报告：村向户分配任务中，有强迫命令和负担不公的偏向。事实如下：（一）有的干部错误的怕群众了解了政策，不实报麦田亩数和产量，因而不向群众宣传政策，却先开会分组，从侧面进行调查，然后再召开群众会自报，互相对照，不实者即追问。结果，形成脱离群众的现象。（二）有些党员干部，错误的认为代表中有群众参加，不好办事。还有的认为代表会起不了什么作用，因此不敢开代表会。在分配任务时，不少村只几个干部开会商量一下，就按户估计分配，然后召开群众大会让群众自认，认不到干部所估计的数目时强迫重认。有的村干部怕麻烦，以麦田亩数按户平均分配。（三）有的村发现村干部和代表负担轻，群众负担重。如二区西高村伊洛俊（群众）全家六口人，耕地十三亩（内水地一亩八分），种麦五亩，实产五百斤，这次负担小麦七十斤。村长王生财全家七口人，耕地十五亩（内园地一亩），种麦四亩半，实产麦四百五十斤，这次负担仅三十斤。代表伊洛乐种麦三亩，共分配十斤。这种负担不平衡的现象，已引起了群众的不满。
    该县中共县委会发现这些偏向后，即于七月六日发出紧急指示，要求各级党的干部及时纠正。指示提出：（一）要认真贯彻夏征政策，深入进行宣传动员。首先要在党内打通思想，然后开好人民代表会，发扬民主精神。争取十号左右分配到户。（二）向户分配是夏征中走好群众路线的中心环节，也是政策贯彻得正确与否的表现。县区干部必须切实掌握夏征中的中心环节。从发动群众中克服单纯的任务观点和强迫命令作风。（三）任务分配到户以后，应掌握麦的质量；把运输工作组织好，以保证顺利完成入库。（四）克服过去某些工作中只布置不检查的毛病，各区当麦征任务布置到户后，应深入检查，发现错误，立即纠正。（五）克服工作中单打一的毛病；在麦征中必须抓紧锄苗、保苗、防洪、放淤等工作。
