    People's Army Treats American Prisoners of War Generously
    American Prisoners of War Are Already Opposing American Aggression Against Korea
    [This Newspaper, Pyongyang, 19th dispatch] Special correspondent Li Zhuang reports from the Korean battlefield: In a prisoner of war camp of the Korean People's Army in a certain location in Korea, I saw a group of American prisoners of war. They were driven by American imperialists to wage a war of aggression in Korea. Now these ninety-nine American prisoners of war have received generous treatment from the Korean prisoner of war camp. When these people were transported to Korea to carry out a war of aggression, they did not know why they were fighting. When we, the visitors (including Koreans, Chinese, British, and French), entered the building of the camp, many of them answered our questions in this way: "As soldiers, we only carry out the orders of our superiors." It turned out that before they were captured, their officers only treated them as gun-firing machines. Among them was a boy of only thirteen years old. An eighteen-year-old young man named Cross (M. Gross), after being captured, was deeply afraid of suffering the "death" fate that their officers usually deceived them with. However, he and more than ninety other prisoners have safely spent two weeks in the camp, receiving the generous treatment of the People's Army, and he has begun not to be afraid. Captain Nugent of the 52nd Field Artillery Battalion of the US 24th Infantry Division was originally the manager of a small theater in the United States. He has the highest rank and education among this group of prisoners. Before he realized that "we prisoners believe that all foreigners should leave Korea immediately and let the Koreans solve their own domestic problems," he "only knew that Korean apples were delicious." Now, he has already signed the joint statement opposing American armed intervention in Korea.

    人民军宽大对待美俘
    美俘已在反对美国侵略朝鲜
    【本报平壤十九日电】朝鲜战地特派记者李庄报道：我在朝鲜某地的战俘收容所中，见到了一群美国俘虏。他们是被美帝国主义者驱使来朝鲜进行侵略战争的。现在这九十九个美国俘虏受到了朝鲜战俘收容所宽大的待遇。他们这些人被运到朝鲜来进行侵略战争的时候，并不知道是为什么打仗。当我们这几个访问者（包括朝鲜人、中国人、英国人、法国人）进到收容所的楼房后，他们很多人都这样回答我们所提出的问题：“我们作为一个兵，只有执行上级的命令。”原来他们在被俘以前，他们的长官只把他们作为会放枪的机器。他们中有一个只有十三岁的少年。有一个十八岁的叫作克罗斯（M.Gross）的青年，在被俘以后，深恐遭受到他们的长官平时欺骗他们的“死”的命运。但是，他和其他九十几个俘虏们，已经在收容所里平安地度过了两个星期，受着人民军的宽大待遇，他已开始不害怕了。美军第二十四师五十二野战炮团上尉牛金特（Nugent）原是美国一个小剧院的经理。他在这群俘虏中是官职和文化程度最高的一个。当他还没有觉悟到“我们这群俘虏认为一切外国人应立即离开朝鲜，让朝鲜人自己去解决他们的国内问题”以前，他是“只知道高丽苹果好吃”的。现在，他已经在反对美国武装干涉朝鲜的联合声明上首先签了名。
