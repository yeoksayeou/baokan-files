Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: Reuter, Sydney: Australian seamen announced on the 7th that they would stop transporting war materials to Korea. The General Secretary of the Australian Seamen's Union, Elliot, announced the decision of the Federal Executive Committee of the union and issued the Executive Committee's resolution, which condemned "Australian Prime Minister Menzies' order for the Australian Navy to obey the United States' orders to blatantly interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people as a dictatorial decision." The resolution also stated: "Australian seamen will mobilize to oppose Menzies' intention to make Australia a colony of the United States," and will "actively oppose the use of Australian troops and war materials to interfere in Korea." The resolution concluded: "The obvious aim of the United States is to use the troops of other countries to carry out aggressive wars in all respects."

    拒运战争物资赴朝鲜
    【新华社九日讯】电通社悉尼讯：澳洲海员于七日宣布制止运输战争物资去朝鲜。澳洲海员工会总书记伊利奥特宣布该工会联邦执行委员会的这一决定时，发表了执委会的决议案，其中斥责“澳洲总理孟席斯下令澳洲海军服从美国为公然干涉朝鲜人民内政而发布的命令，乃是独裁的决定”。决议案又称：“澳洲海员将动员起来反对孟席斯的使澳洲成为美国殖民地的意图”，并“积极地反对用澳洲军队和战争物资去干涉朝鲜”。决议案最后称：“美国的明显目的，是利用其他国家的军队在各方面进行侵略战争。”
