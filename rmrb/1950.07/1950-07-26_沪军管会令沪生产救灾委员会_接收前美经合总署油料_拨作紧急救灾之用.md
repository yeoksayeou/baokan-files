　　Shanghai Military Control Commission Orders Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee
    To Receive Oil Materials from Former US Economic Cooperation Administration
    Allocated for Emergency Disaster Relief
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th] On July 17th, the Shanghai Military Control Commission, according to the order of March 16th regarding the takeover of materials left in Shanghai by the former US Economic Cooperation Administration to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's civil war, further ordered the Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee to receive US-aid oil materials left in Shanghai by the former US Economic Cooperation Administration for which equivalent funds had not been paid, to be used for emergency disaster relief. According to this, this oil material was one of the four major materials used by the US imperialists to aid Chiang in carrying out the anti-people civil war (the other three materials were cotton, grain, and fertilizer). The purchasing and transportation procedure was as follows: the former US Economic Cooperation Administration provided foreign exchange, and the four oil companies in Shanghai, namely Texaco, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and China America Petroleum, were responsible for purchasing and transporting the materials to China. After paying the equivalent funds to the special account for oil sales of the puppet Central Bank, they would go through customs import procedures as ordinary oil materials; before the oil companies paid the equivalent funds, the oil materials were entirely owned by the former US Economic Cooperation Administration. After the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai Military Control Commission sealed up this batch of oil materials for which equivalent funds had not been paid, and instructed the oil companies to pay the equivalent funds to the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China before going through import procedures, and not to use them before paying the equivalent funds. In addition to not immediately paying the equivalent funds as ordered, the oil companies also unreasonably distorted the ownership of the oil materials as belonging to their respective companies. Later, they even claimed that they had returned the foreign exchange for this oil material, which had long been sealed and forbidden from use, to the US Economic Cooperation Administration, attempting to seize it. This was clearly a deliberate violation of laws and regulations. Therefore, on July 17th, the Shanghai Military Control Commission ordered each oil company involved to hand over the oil materials in full, and not to disobey the order, resist, or conceal it. Otherwise, they would be severely punished.

　　沪军管会令沪生产救灾委员会
    接收前美经合总署油料
    拨作紧急救灾之用
    【新华社上海二十日电】七月十七日，上海市军事管制委员会根据三月十六日接收前美国经济合作总署留存上海的援助蒋匪帮内战物资的命令，续令上海生产救灾委员会接收前美国经济合作总署留存上海未付等值基金之美援油料，拨作紧急救灾之用。按此项油料系美帝国主义者援蒋进行反人民内战的四大物资之一（其余三项物资为棉花、粮食、肥料），其购运程序系由前美国经济合作总署供给外汇，由上海德士古、美孚、亚细亚、中美四油公司负责购运来华，向伪中央银行石油售价专户缴纳等值基金后，再按一般油料办理报关进口手续；在油公司未付等值基金之前，油料完全为前美国经济合作总署所有。上海解放后，上海市军管会即将该批未付等值基金油料封存，并指示各油公司应向中国人民银行上海分行缴纳等值基金后办理进口手续，在未付等值基金前不得动用。各油公司除不遵令即时缴付等值基金，并多方无理曲解油料的所有权为各公司所有外，后更声称已将此项早经封存禁止动用之油料外汇退还美国经济合作总署，妄图侵占，显系故违法令。因此，上海市军事管制委员会于七月十七日命令各经办油公司将是项油料如数交出，不得违令抗拒，隐匿不报，否则将严惩不贷。
