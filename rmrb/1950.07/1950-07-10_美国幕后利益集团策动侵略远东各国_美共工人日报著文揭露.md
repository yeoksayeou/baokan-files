Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 7th: The Worker's Daily, in explaining the behind-the-scenes interest groups instigating American aggression in the Far East, writes: Historically and ethnically, Taiwan is a part of China. The most valuable resource contained in Taiwan is bauxite ore. All of the bauxite deposits were previously held by Japanese companies. After the war, the exclusive rights to bauxite were transferred to Reynolds Metals Company, which is related to Reynolds Tobacco Company. Gray, who only recently resigned from the post of Secretary of the Army, also has ties to the Reynolds family.

One of the biggest capitalists in the Philippines is none other than General MacArthur himself. MacArthur's company not only runs plantations, but also extends to profitable enterprises such as Kochamin Iron Mines Company, Antamok Goldfields Mining Company, and Paracale-Gumaus Consolidated Mining Company. However, in order for these enterprises to generate colonial super-profits, investment must be combined with starvation wages and working conditions for workers. And the only way to maintain this situation is to use brutal terror against Philippine labor unions and popular resistance armies – groups fighting for genuine national independence – and against Korean labor unions and Taiwan's liberation forces.

Commenting on the situation in South Korea, the Worker's Daily writes: In the five years since Wall Street's occupation, more than 40 percent of all factories have closed. Items that South Korea was previously able to manufacture itself now have to be imported from the United States. South Korea once produced large quantities of fertilizer. But when South Korea's fertilizer factories finally went bankrupt, fertilizers worth 35 million yuan were imported from the United States between July and December 1948. South Korea currently provides no assistance to the unemployed, and even those who are employed are enduring lower real wages and worse working conditions than during the Japanese occupation. Working hours are ten to fourteen hours a day. Transportation workers work eighty hours a week (the transportation industry is U.S.-owned). There are no restrictions on child labor. Young female workers at the New Han Textile Factory in Seoul work more than ninety hours a week. Even the United Nations Commission on Korea, which is controlled by the United States, had to report that prices rose twenty-fold between December 1945 and January 1948. It is not surprising that trade union leaders are being held en masse in Syngman Rhee's prisons and that strikes are banned. It is also not surprising that Syngman Rhee is trying to eliminate the North Korean government by force, because the achievements of North Korea are inspiring the people of South Korea to rise up against the Syngman Rhee puppet regime.

### 美国幕后利益集团策动侵略远东各国  美共工人日报著文揭露

　　美国幕后利益集团策动侵略远东各国
    美共工人日报著文揭露
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社纽约七日讯：工人日报说明策动美国侵略远东的幕后利益集团时写道：在历史上和人种上，台湾都是中国的一部分。台湾所蕴藏的最有价值的资源是铁矾土的矿藏。铁矾土的全部矿藏以前是握在日本公司的手中。在战后，铁矾土的独占权已转移给与雷诺烟草公司有关系的雷诺五金公司了。直到最近才辞去陆军部长一职的格雷，也是与雷诺家族有裙带关系的。
    在菲律宾的最大资本家之一不是别人，正是麦克阿瑟将军本人。麦克阿瑟的公司不但经营种植业，而且也扩展到科查铭铁矿公司，安特莫金矿和百老湾岛矿山这些有利可图的企业中。但是为了要使这些企业产生殖民地的超额利润，投资就必须与要工人挨饿的工资及工作条件结合起来。而唯一能够维持这种情况的办法，就是用严酷的恐怖手段，来对付菲律宾的工会与民抗军这一类争取国家真正独立的团体，来对付朝鲜的工会与台湾的解放力量。
    工人日报评论南朝鲜局势时写道：在华尔街占领五年以来，全部工厂百分之四十以上已经关闭。南朝鲜以前自己能够制造的物品，现在必须从美国输入了。南朝鲜曾一度制造大量肥料。但当南朝鲜的肥料制造厂终于倒闭时，在一九四八年七月至十二月间，就从美国输入价值三千五百万元的肥料。南朝鲜目前对失业者不但毫无援助，就是那些在业者也在忍受比日本统治时期还要低的实际工资和更恶劣的工作情况。每天工作的时间是十小时至十四小时。运输工人每周工作八十小时（运输业是美国所有的）。童工是没有限制的。汉城的新汉纺织厂的青年女工每周工作九十小时以上。即使是美国把持的联合国朝鲜委员会也不得不报告：一九四五年十二月至一九四八年一月，物价上涨了二十倍。职工会领袖被大批关在李承晚的监狱里和罢工被禁止，是不足为奇的事。李承晚设法用武力消灭北朝鲜政府也是不足为奇的，因为北朝鲜的成就感召着南朝鲜的人民起来反对李承晚傀儡政权。
