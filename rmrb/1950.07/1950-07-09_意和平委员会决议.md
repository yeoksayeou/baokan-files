Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 1st: The Italian Peace Committee held a national conference, with representatives from the peace committees of all provinces participating. The conference discussed the threat of war posed by the direct American aggression in the Far East, and the position that the Italian peace movement should adopt.

    Nenni, Chairman of the National Peace Committee, in his speech at the meeting, first protested against the Italian government's decision to refuse entry visas to representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Genoa this October. Nenni said: "Reactionary administrative measures cannot stop the great peace movement that is spreading throughout the world!" Referring to the situation in Korea, Nenni emphasized that this was a direct consequence of the policy pursued by the United States. Truman's military provocation in Korea was an action that violated the United Nations and violated the United Nations Charter.

    Cereni, Secretary-General of the Peace Committee, pointed out in his speech the unprecedented scale of the Italian peace movement and proposed convening a national Italian peace conference.

    Vittorio, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, spoke, expressing the Italian working people's extreme indignation at the United States' obstruction of social progress and unification in Korea.

    The Peace Committee passed a resolution exposing the American military intervention as an open act of aggression against the people of Korea and China; calling on all people of goodwill to participate in the peace movement to achieve the goal of stopping the war, and first and foremost, to withdraw American troops. The resolution protested against the government's refusal to issue entry visas to representatives of the Second World Peace Congress; and suggested convening a national peace conference, welcoming the participation of all people.

    意和平委员会决议
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社罗马一日讯：意大利和平委员会举行了全国会议，各省的和平委员会均派有代表参加。大会讨论了美国在远东的直接侵略行动所引起的战争威胁，以及意大利和平运动应采取何种立场的问题。
    全国和平委员会主席南尼在会上的发言，首先对意政府拒发本年十月在热那亚召开的第二次世界和平大会代表的入境签证的决定，表示抗议。南尼说：“反动的行政措施，不能阻挠全世界范围的伟大的和平运动！”在论及朝鲜形势时，南尼强调指出，这是美国奉行的政策的直接后果。杜鲁门在朝鲜进行了军事挑衅，这是违反联合国的行动，并且违犯了联合国宪章。

    总工会总书记维多里奥发言，表示意大利劳动人民对美国阻挠朝鲜的社会进步和统一，极为愤慨。
    和平委员会通过决议，揭露美国的军事干涉，乃是对朝鲜和中国人民的公开侵略行动；号召一切善良的人民参加和平运动，以达成制止战争，而首先是使美国军队撤退的目标。决议对政府拒发二次世界和平大会代表入境签证提出抗议；并建议召开全国和平会议，欢迎一切人民参加。
