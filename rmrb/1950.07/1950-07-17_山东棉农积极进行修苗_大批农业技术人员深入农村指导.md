Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th. Cotton farmers in Shandong Province have completed the second weeding of cotton fields and are now actively thinning seedlings and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. Throughout the province, cotton seedlings are growing vigorously due to timely weeding and sufficient rainfall, and have generally reached a height of eight or nine inches.

In leading the seedling thinning work, the Shandong Provincial People's Government first organized cadres from agricultural farms in various counties and a large number of agricultural technicians to go deep into rural areas to guide cotton farmers in thinning seedlings. Cadres from Dongguang Farm first helped one household thin seedlings as a demonstration, and then mobilized other cotton farmers to visit, thereby improving the cotton farmers' seedling thinning techniques. Local farms also held symposiums for labor models and production activists to exchange seedling thinning experiences. At the same time as thinning seedlings, cotton farmers in various places also paid attention to killing pests and protecting cotton seedlings. For example, Bin County, which is famous for its Binzhou cotton, had 300,000 mu of cotton fields that suffered from cotton aphid infestations. The county is now establishing county, district, and village pest control leadership organizations to mobilize cotton farmers to carry out pest control campaigns. People's governments in various parts of the province are also providing loans for pesticides and equipment with a focus on pest control, actively assisting cotton farmers in eliminating cotton pests. In addition, some farm cadres are leading cotton farmers in areas with missing seedlings to transplant and replenish cotton seedlings after rain.

　　山东棉农积极进行修苗
    大批农业技术人员深入农村指导
    【新华社济南十一日电】山东省棉田二遍锄草工作业已结束，现广大棉农正积极进行修苗及防治病虫害等工作。全省棉苗由于修锄及时，雨水充足，生长均极旺盛，现已普遍长高八、九寸。
    山东省人民政府在领导修棉时，首先组织了各县农场干部和大批农业技术人员，深入农村指导棉农修棉。东光农场干部首先深入帮助一户修棉作为示范，再动员其他棉农前去参观，从而提高了棉农的修棉技术。各地农场还分别召开了劳动模范和生产积极分子座谈会，交流修棉经验。与修棉同时，各地棉农并注意杀除害虫，保护棉苗。如素以滨州棉花著名的滨县，曾有三十万亩棉田遭受棉蚜侵害，现该县正在成立县、区、村除虫领导机构，以发动棉农开展除虫运动。全省各地人民政府也在除虫中有重点地贷放杀虫药械，积极协助棉农除去棉花害虫。此外，有的农场干部并领导缺苗地区的棉农于雨后移补棉苗。
