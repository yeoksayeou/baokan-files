Xinhua News Agency report: The work of unified cash management by state organs has achieved significant results. More than 80 percent of state organs in major cities across the country subject to cash management have opened accounts at local People's Banks. Among them, approximately 17 percent have submitted cash revenue and expenditure plans and determined inventory limits to the banks. As a result, state banks have gained control over a large amount of cash, enhancing the planning of capital utilization and relatively reducing the amount of currency in circulation in the market. At the same time, due to the implementation of a transfer system, cash receipts and payments have been reduced to a minimum. According to statistics from the head office of the People's Bank of China, transfer receipts and payments account for an average of 95 percent of the total receipts and payments in major cities, while cash receipts and payments account for 5 percent. The 5 percent of cash receipts and payments are mostly transactions with private deposits; as for receipts and payments between state-owned enterprises, government agencies, and cooperatives, the vast majority have adopted the method of check transfers.

After the implementation of cash management, the relationship between banks and state organs is no longer simply a customer-client relationship in terms of deposits. The People's Bank has begun to gradually become the center for cash disbursement of state organs. At the same time, state banks have developed a closer relationship with state-owned enterprises. In the process of implementing cash management, banks have helped some units with unclear accounts in the past to establish sound accounting and cashier systems. Banks have also begun to understand the operating conditions of certain enterprise organizations (such as the production process of factories), which is of great help for granting loans correctly in the future.

The relationship between state organs has also been improved due to the implementation of check transfers. In the past, when Agency A ordered or purchased goods from Agency B, it was very troublesome to carry cash back and forth. Now, both parties have begun to sign order contracts, stipulating the specifications of the goods and the delivery date, and only a transfer from the bank is required when the time comes. More importantly, although various agencies were in the same economic system in the past, the relationship between them was only a simple buying and selling relationship. Now, they have begun to have close cooperation.

The deposit figures of the People's Bank have increased more than tenfold compared with the beginning of the year, while the deposit reserve ratio has been greatly reduced. Taking the Shanghai branch as an example, before the implementation of cash management this year, the deposit reserve ratio had to account for 20 to 30 percent of the deposit amount, and now only 3 percent, with a maximum of no more than 5 percent, is sufficient to meet withdrawals. Therefore, the state bank's ability to utilize funds and provide loans to support production has increased.

In addition, before the implementation of cash management, individual state organs (such as some units in Hankou) deposited cash in private banks and firms, and rushed to purchase materials in the market when prices fluctuated. This greatly damaged the state-owned trading organizations' ability to stabilize prices. After the implementation of cash management measures, this phenomenon has gradually been clarified.

At present, the work of cash management is uneven among different regions. Some branches implemented it earlier than the district bank's deployment, and some sub-branches started earlier than the branch. Therefore, the procedures, systems, and institutions for managing cash are not entirely the same in various places. Now the head office of the People's Bank of China is preparing to formulate unified methods in order to improve the work of managing cash on the existing basis.

### 现金管理工作已有重大成绩  国家银行渐成现金中心

　　现金管理工作已有重大成绩
    国家银行渐成现金中心
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：国家机关现金统一管理的工作已有重大成绩，全国各主要城市应受现金管理的国家机关，已有百分之八十以上在各地人民银行开户。其中约有百分之十七已向银行编送现金收支计划和确定库存限额。国家银行因此已掌握了大批现金，增强了资金运用的计划性，并相对地减少了市场的货币流通量。同时，由于实行了转账制度，现金的收支已减至极小限度，据人民银行总行统计，各主要城市收付总额平均转账收支占百分之九十五，现金收支占百分之五。百分之五的现金收支大部系与私人存款的往来；至于公营企业、机关、合作社之间的收付，绝大多数已采用了支票转账的办法。
    实行现金管理后，银行与国家机关间已非过去单纯存款上的主客关系，人民银行已开始逐步成为国家机关现金出纳的中心。同时，国家银行已与国家企业发生了更密切的关系。在实行现金管理过程中，银行帮助有些过去账目不清的单位建立了健全的会计、出纳制度，银行也开始了解某些企业机构的经营情况（例如工厂的生产过程），对今后正确地发放贷款有很大的帮助。
    国家机关彼此之间的关系也由于实行了支票转账而获得改进。过去甲机构向乙机构订货或购货，捧着钞票转来送去，手续十分麻烦。现在双方开始签订定货合同，规定货品的规格、交货日期，到时只要由银行转一笔账即可。更重要的是过去各机关虽在一个经济体系中，而彼此之间的关系仅仅是单纯的买卖关系，现在彼此间已开始有了密切的合作。
    目前人民银行的存款数字已较年初增加十倍以上，而存款准备金却较前大为降低。以上海分行为例，今年未实行现金管理前，存款准备金要占存款额的百分之二十至三十，现在仅需百分之三，最高不超过百分之五，即足以应付支取。因此，国家银行运用资金和贷款扶助生产的力量已经增加。
    此外，实行现金管理前个别国家机关（例如汉口的某些单位）将现金存入私营行庄，遇物价波动时即在市场抢购物资。这大大损害了国营贸易机构平抑物价的力量。现金管理办法实行以后，这种现象已渐告澄清。
    目前现金管理的工作，在各地区之间是不平衡的。有些分行在区行布置工作前已提早实行，有些支行又先于分行而开始实行。因此，管理现金的手续、制度、机构等，各地都不尽相同。现在人民银行总行正准备制订统一的办法，以便在现有基础上将管理现金的工作提高一步。
