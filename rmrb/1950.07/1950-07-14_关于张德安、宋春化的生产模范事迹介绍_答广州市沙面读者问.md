　　Introduction to the Model Worker Deeds of Zhang De'an and Song Chunhua
    Answer to a Reader's Question from Shamian, Guangzhou

    To the Editor:
    In order to improve our enterprise and increase production, our members are studying the editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" published in your newspaper on February 7th. The fourth paragraph contains the following sentences: "...In the production movement, hundreds and thousands of model heroes such as Zhao Guoyou, Li Yong, Zhang De'an, and Song Chunhua have emerged..." We would like to know the deeds of these model heroes in detail so that we can learn from them. Please provide a detailed introduction to their situations.

                                Guangzhou Shamian Sixth District Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union Preparatory Committee
To the Comrades of the Preparatory Committee:
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Production Department has already replied to your question. Because the materials of Comrade Zhao Guoyou and Comrade Li Yong have already been introduced (the deeds of Comrade Zhao Guoyou have been published in the first issue of "Chinese Workers"; for the deeds of Comrade Li Yong, please refer to this newspaper on April 22nd and May 21st of last year), they will not be reprinted. The model deeds of Comrade Zhang De'an and Comrade Song Chunhua are introduced below.

                   Editor
            Comrade Zhang De'an
    Comrade Zhang De'an is an old worker with more than 30 years of service in the Dong Station Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau. He has good skills, is not conservative, and is not arrogant. In the early days of liberation, some workers were not highly aware and did not work hard, but under his persuasion and leadership, they changed their work attitude and became good workers serving the people.

    In April of last year, the Railway Bureau ordered the repair of a dead locomotive frame within 15 days. He immediately mobilized all the workers to overcome difficulties and complete the task. Everyone happily accepted the task of repairing this dead locomotive and proposed to complete the work before May Day. Comrade Zhang De'an led many workers to voluntarily work overtime and make the most of waste materials, and within seven days, he brought this "dead locomotive back to life." Now this locomotive has become one of the model locomotives in the depot.

    When the production and frugality campaign was launched in July of last year, they were the first to respond to the call, proposing to complete the work plan of overhauling six locomotives per month. They also guaranteed to improve the quality of the locomotives, so that after the locomotives left the workshop, they could run long distances and express trains without a single-machine test run. This was something that could not be done in the past.

    All the workers he led were very careful in their repairs, ensuring that every part met the standards. In the Tianjin Railway Bureau's overhaul competition, the locomotives repaired by their depot won the first and second place. At the same time, he trained a lot of technical reserves and promoted excellent workers. The depot has many "overhaul team leaders," "inspection team leaders," and "instructor drivers," all of whom were promoted by him. He is not afraid of trouble and is not conservative when giving technical lectures and internships at night school. He has now been transferred to the position of technical deputy director of the entire depot.
            Comrade Song Chunhua
    Comrade Song Chunhua is a worker at the Tianjin Huidui Paper Mill, 28 years old. He has 12 years of service. He is a person with a strong will. The factory has a single-cylinder round-net paper machine, which could only produce rough-edged and Lian Shi paper during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Moreover, it was necessary to use yellow okra as an auxiliary raw material, but this raw material was extremely scarce. For this reason, someone had modified the machine once before liberation, but it failed. After liberation, work stopped due to the inability to buy yellow okra. Comrade Song Chunhua was working in the bleaching room at the time, and he was constantly thinking of ideas for this matter. Finally, he drew a diagram of the modification of the No. 1 paper machine. At that time, many people did not believe that his plan could succeed or thought that it was not very likely. Comrade Song Chunhua confidently insisted on the modification plan, and with the support of the military representative of the factory, Comrade Song Chunhua and six other people formed a modification team. They used the spray device of the long net on the round net, and the modification was finally successful. Production could be started without yellow okra. In addition to producing rough-edged and Lian Shi paper, it can also produce 45-pound newsprint and glazed paper, and the number of machine operators has been reduced from 14 to 6, while saving two people who were watching the yellow okra. It saves about 500 jin of corn flour per day.

　　关于张德安、宋春化的生产模范事迹介绍
    答广州市沙面读者问编辑同志：
    我会会员为要搞好企业，增加生产，正学习贵报二月七日登载的社论《学会管理企业》，文中第四段有这样几句话：“……在生产运动中，已产生了成百上千的赵国有、李永、张德安、宋春化等模范英雄人物……”我们很想知道这几位模范英雄的事迹，以便学习。请你们把他们的情况作一个详细的介绍。
                                广州沙面第六区电信管理局工会筹备会启筹备会同志们：
    你们的问题已经中华全国总工会生产部答复。因为赵国有同志和李永同志的材料已有介绍（赵国有同志事迹已载《中国工人》第一期；李永同志事迹参阅去年四月二十二日及五月二十一日本报。），故不重刊。兹将张德安及宋春化同志的模范事迹介绍如下。                   
                   编者
            张德安同志
    张德安同志是天津铁路局东站机务段三十多年工龄的老工人。他的技术好，不保守，不自高自大。解放初期，有些工人觉悟程度不高，不好好干活，但在他的说服和带动工作下，都改变了劳动态度，成为为人民服务的好工人。
    去年四月，路局限令在十五日内修复只剩下一个空架子的死车。他即动员全体工人克服困难完成任务。大家愉快地接受了包修这台死车的任务，并提出“五一”节以前完工。张德安同志带动许多工友自动加班，尽量利用废料，在七天内就使这台“死车复活”了。现在这一台车，成为该段的模范机车之一。
    去年七月展开生产节约立功运动时，他们首先响应号召，提出每月完成甲检六台机车的工作计划。并保证提高机车质量，在机车出房后，不经单机试运转就能跑长途和急行。这都是过去所做不到的事。
    他所带动的全体工友，检修时非常细心，使每一个零件都合乎标准。在天津路局的甲检比赛中，他们段里修复的机车，取得了第一、第二名。他同时培养了不少技术后备军，提拔了优秀的工人。段里拥有许多“甲检领班”、“检查领班”、“指导司机”，这都是经他提拔出来的。他在夜校讲技术课和实习时，不怕麻烦，不保守。他现已调任全段的技术副主任。
            宋春化同志
    宋春化同志是天津灰堆造纸厂工人，二十八岁。有十二年工龄。是一个意志坚强的人。该厂有一台单烘缸圆网造纸机，在日寇和国民党反动派统治时期只能造毛边、连史等纸张。而且必须用黄蜀癸作补助原料，可是这种原料极为缺乏。解放前为此曾有人把机器改装过一次，但遭受了失败。解放后因买不到黄蜀癸而停工了。宋春化同志当时在漂白室工作，时时刻刻为这件事情想主意。最后，他画出了改装一号造纸机的图案。当时很多人不相信他的计划能够成功或认为把握不大。宋春化同志自信地坚持改装计划，在该厂军事代表的支持下，由宋春化同志和另外六个人组成了改装小组。他们把长网的喷装式用在圆网上，改装终于成功。不要黄蜀癸也可以开工生产了。除出产毛边、连史外，还可出四十五磅的新闻纸和油光纸，并且使看车工人由十四人减为六人，同时省下了看黄蜀癸的两个人。每天节省约合玉米面五百斤。
