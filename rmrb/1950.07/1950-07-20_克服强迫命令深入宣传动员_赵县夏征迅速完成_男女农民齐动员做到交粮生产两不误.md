　　Overcoming Coercive Orders Through Intensive Publicity and Mobilization
　　Zhao County Quickly Completes Summer Grain Collection
　　Male and Female Farmers Mobilized to Ensure Grain Delivery and Production Are Not Delayed
　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhao County] Zhao County, Hebei Province, has completed its summer grain collection work. Since the end of June, the county convened a three-level expanded cadre meeting at the county, district, and village levels to deploy the summer grain collection work. Party member cadres in each district and village actively publicized the policies, launched the work, and took the lead in paying. Collection began on July 5th and was completed by the 11th. The reason why the county's collection task was completed so quickly is mainly due to the leaders' emphasis on promoting democracy and vigorously reversing the subjective, coercive, and other bad work styles that occurred in the grain collection work of previous years.
　　The county gained the following experiences in this work:
　　1. The combination of mass self-reporting and evaluation with leadership's key surveys makes it easier to achieve a fair and reasonable burden. Before the deployment of wheat collection, the county's Finance Section focused on investigating three types of villages with good, bad, and average yields. At the same time, each district's finance assistant and the leader of the work group sent by the county government to each district to guide production were responsible for surveying the annual yield of ordinary villages. The government and the CCP Zhao County Committee also convened forums with village cadres and branch committee members from seven or eight villages in each district to understand the situation in each village, laying a good foundation for the distribution of tasks. This basically overcame the antagonistic phenomenon in previous years when county and district cadres argued with village cadres about the level of output during the deployment of tasks, making the burden distribution generally fair and reasonable.
　　2. Overcome the bad work style of bureaucratism and commandism. On June 26, the County Party Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries of directly affiliated organs, district party committee secretaries, and village party branch secretaries to conduct a profound review of the bureaucratic and commandist work styles in the work, and proposed to mobilize the entire party to resolutely implement the instructions of the higher party on the rectification movement. In the summer grain collection, we should implement the policy of reasonable burden to complete the summer grain collection work. At the meeting, 21 village branches, including Dashiqiao, made typical reports on completing previous autumn grain collection, aphid elimination, cotton planting, and other tasks by following the mass line; Nan’s Temple Village and Gao Village also reported the painful lessons of using coercive orders to fail to complete the task and violating policies. Therefore, the erroneous idea of some cadres that tasks could not be completed without coercion and command was corrected.
　　3. Conduct in-depth publicity and make good preparations. In the entire collection work, the general preparation stage should be long. Issues such as the assessment of yields, care for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as the elderly, widowed, and weak who are unable to pay, and the appropriate recovery of various agricultural loans must be thoroughly discussed within the Party, among cadres, and especially at the farmers' representative meetings. The county's village radio stations and blackboards are uniformly controlled by the village propaganda committees and primary school teachers for general publicity. And mobilize the masses to deliver good grain. For example, 20 party members in Zhuajia Village divided the work to mobilize the whole village to dry and pick wheat. In Yaojia Village, 73 of the 80 households that grow wheat had dried and picked wheat. Due to sufficient preparations in advance, most villages only needed to hang the scales and start collection to complete everything in one or two days. Yaojia Village in the First District completed it at 3:30.
　　4. Cadres and party members took the lead, breaking through the masses' ideas of procrastination and wait-and-see attitude. In previous years' collections, many village party member cadres focused on urging the masses to pay early, while they themselves delayed payment, even leaving arrears unpaid, leaving a very bad impression among the masses. This year, however, party members and cadres paid first. In Xinzhaidian, Third District, 13 party members and 17 members of the Communist Youth League set plans to lead the masses with their own exemplary actions. Du Bingyin paid first and personally mobilized 15 households to pay together. Zhao Shanniu led four households to pay together, competing for the first weighing. Women's Federation Director Yu Xiaohuan paid the grain, then rocked the windmill, and took time to mobilize more than 50 women members to replace male laborers to deliver grain, so as to ensure that both grain delivery and production were not delayed. In Yaojia Village, there were 25 mutual aid groups for production, with a total of 87 households. The party member group members planned to have each group send two people to assist the women in their families in delivering grain, while other male laborers continued to produce as usual.
　　5. Conduct in-depth inspections and correct deviations in a timely manner. Assigning cadres to take the lead in key areas solved the difficulty of having fewer district cadres. In addition, for example, in Yangjia Village and other 16 or 17 villages in the Fourth District, a large-scale wheat field registration was conducted during the investigation of yields. As a result, the number of acres decreased each time the registration was made. It was later corrected after timely research. Another example is that cadres in Xihe Village in the First District deliberately improved quality when evaluating yields, increasing the yield from eight dou to one shi, which was also corrected in time after being discovered.

### 克服强迫命令深入宣传动员  赵县夏征迅速完成  男女农民齐动员做到交粮生产两不误

　　克服强迫命令深入宣传动员
    赵县夏征迅速完成
    男女农民齐动员做到交粮生产两不误
    【本报赵县讯】河北省赵县的夏征工作已经完成。该县自六月底召开了县、区、村三级扩大干部会，布置了夏征工作以后，各区、村党员干部即积极宣传政策，展开工作并带头交纳。七月五日起开始征收，至十一日即全部完成。该县征收任务之所以很快完成，主要是领导干部的重视、发扬民主与大力扭转了历年征粮工作中发生的主观主义和强迫命令等恶劣作风的结果。
    该县在此次工作中获得了以下几点经验：
    一、群众自报评议和领导重点勘查相结合，容易作到负担公平合理。麦征未布置前，该县由政府财政科重点调查了好的、坏的及一般的三种产量类型村。同时各区财政助理员和县府派往各区领导生产的工作组长，都负责勘查了一般村庄的年景产量。政府及中共赵县县委又分别召集了每区七、八个村的村干部及支部委员的座谈会，了解各村的情况，为分配任务打下了良好的基础。基本上克服了历年布置任务时，县、区干部与村干部为产量高低争执不下的对立现象，使负担分配一般作到了公平合理。
    二、克服官僚主义、命令主义的坏作风。县委于六月二十六日召开了直属机关支部书记、各区委书记、各村支部书记会议，对工作中的官僚主义、命令主义作风作了深刻的检讨，并提出动员全党坚决贯彻上级党关于全党整风的指示，在夏征中，则贯彻合理负担政策完成夏征工作。会上有大石桥等二十一个村支部作了走群众路线完成以往的秋征、除蚜、种棉等各种工作的典型报告；南寺家庄、高庄二个村也报告了用强迫命令不能完成任务，又违背政策的痛苦教训。因而纠正了某些干部认为不强迫、不命令就不能完成任务的错误思想。
    三、深入宣传，作好准备工作。在整个征收工作时间，一般准备阶段要长。有关评定产量，烈、军、工属及孤寡老弱实无力交纳的照顾，各种农贷的适当收回等问题，都须在党内，在干部中，特别是农民代表会上作深入的讨论。全县各村的广播台、黑板报统一由村宣传委员会和小学教师掌握，作一般宣传。并发动群众交好粮。如爪家庄二十个党员，分工发动全村晒麦子、拣麦子。姚家庄全村八十户种麦子的，有七十三户都晒过和拣了麦子。由于事前准备的充足，一般村只要挂秤开征，一二天即全部完成。一区姚家庄三点半钟就完成了。
    四、干部、党员带头，突破了群众拖缴、观望的思想。该县历年征收中，不少的村党员干部着重督促群众早交，而自己拖交，甚至留下尾欠不交，在群众中留下很坏的影响。今年则是党员、干部先交。三区新寨店十三个党员和十七个青年团员，都定了计划，以自己模范行动带动群众。杜丙寅自己先交了，亲自动员了十五户一齐交纳。赵傻牛带动了四户一齐交，争头秤。妇会主任于小环交了粮，就摇风车，还抽空动员了妇女会员五十多人代替男劳力交粮，以便交粮生产两不误。姚家庄有生产互助组二十五个，共八十七户都由党员组员计划，每组抽出二人协助家中妇女交粮，其他男劳力照常生产。
    五、深入检查，及时纠正偏向。配备干部作重点领导，解决了区干部少的困难。另外，如四区杨家庄等十六、七个村，在调查产量时，举行了麦田大登记，结果是登记几次，一次比一次亩数减少。后经及时研究加以纠正。又如一区西河村干部，在评产量时，故意提高质量，将八斗产量提高到一石，被发觉后也及时纠正了。
