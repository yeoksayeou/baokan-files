Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The water release ceremony for the Jiyun River Irrigation Project and the establishment ceremony for the Gaoli District State-Owned Farm, both under the Bohai District Land Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, were jointly held at the Gaoli District State-Owned Farm in Lutai at 10:00 AM on the 16th of this month. Minister Li Shucheng of the Central Ministry of Agriculture personally presided over the event. Among those attending the ceremony were Soviet agricultural water conservancy experts Rusenko and Gulaichev, as well as representatives from the Bohai District Land Reclamation Bureau and its affiliated farms, the Central Financial and Economic Committee, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, and relevant agencies from Beijing and Tianjin, totaling more than 200 people. At 8:00 AM, the water release ceremony was held in front of the No. 1 Pumping Station in Gaoli District. After Minister Li Shucheng cut the ribbon, the water pumps were started, and the water from the Jiyun River flowed continuously from the flume, being transported through canals to various parts of the farm.

The Jiyun River Irrigation Project is one of the four major irrigation projects in the Bohai District (the other three being the Luan River, Hai River, and South Grand Canal areas). The entire project is led by the Jiyun River Irrigation Project Office under the Bohai District Land Reclamation Bureau. The lower reaches of the Jiyun River were originally a vast expanse of saline-alkali wasteland, with alluvial loess soil that was fertile but slightly alkaline. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1938, the Japanese invaders forcibly purchased more than 52,000 mu of land from eighteen villages near Lutai, including Dazhuang, to establish a farm. At the same time, they built seven electric pumping stations to use the water from the Jiyun River to wash away the alkali and grow rice. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, these pumping facilities were destroyed twice by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit troops. All the electric motors were lost, the water pumps were almost completely destroyed, and only broken walls and ruins remained of the factory buildings and equipment. Most of the land was also abandoned. After the liberation of Pingjin in 1949, the farm was taken over by the Jingu Land Reclamation Bureau (now renamed the Bohai District Land Reclamation Bureau). After taking over, the bureau immediately planned to restore the Gaoli District and nearby farms in Lutai at the same time. In October of last year, work began on repairing the pumping station equipment. After half a year of efforts by more than 130,000 laborers and more than 30,000 technical workers, by the end of April this year, in addition to completely repairing the original seven pumping facilities, a new No. 8 pumping station was built. Water has been released since May 1st. If all twenty water pumps in the pumping stations are started simultaneously, 24 tons of water can be drawn from the Jiyun River every second, ensuring the irrigation of more than 80,000 mu of reclaimed saline-alkali land in Lutai and Gaoli District from now on. It is estimated that if the existing water conservancy facilities are fully utilized, the irrigated area can be increased by more than 30,000 mu.

The Gaoli District State-Owned Farm has a total of more than 52,000 mu of reclaimed land, of which more than 13,000 mu are operated in cooperation with local farmers, and have been divided into South and North cooperative zones. More than 30,000 mu of cultivated land in the state-owned area has been divided into six zones. In order to adapt to the local soil conditions, the farm decided to adopt the experience of advanced countries such as the Soviet Union and implement a six-year rotation system with rice as the main crop, with three zones planting rice, one zone planting cotton, and two zones planting pasture each year, alternating every six years. At the same time, the farming methods of deep plowing, close planting, and direct seeding of rice in dry land were clearly stipulated, and machine cultivation was adopted.

In his speech at the water release ceremony and the establishment meeting of the state-owned farm, Minister Li Shucheng of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government pointed out: The successful construction of the Jiyun River Irrigation Project and the establishment of the Gaoli District State-Owned Farm prove that only the People's Government will earnestly engage in production undertakings that are beneficial to the people. The entire Jiyun River Irrigation Project was designed by our own engineers, and all the machinery was also self-made. The successful construction of this project has further strengthened our confidence in future production and construction undertakings. The establishment of the Gaoli District State-Owned Farm points out the direction of agricultural development in our country. We should learn from the experience of this farm and other state-owned farms to gradually improve our agricultural production.

　　蓟运河灌溉工程落成放水
    高里区国营农场同时成立 
    李书城部长出席剪彩苏联友人参加典礼
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府农业部渤海区农垦管理局所属蓟运河灌溉工程放水及高里区国营农场成立典礼，本月十六日上午十时在芦台高里区国营农场合并举行。中央农业部李书城部长亲往主持。参加典礼的有苏联农业水利专家鲁森科及古拉依切夫，和渤海区农垦管理局及所属农场、中央财政经济委员会、人民银行总行、中央人民政府水利部、燃料工业部、天津市人民政府等，京、津有关机关代表共二百多人。上午八时在高里区第一扬水场前举行放水典礼，由李书城部长剪彩后，即开动水泵，蓟运河的水从水槽中源源流出，沿渠道输送至农场各地。
    蓟运河灌溉工程是渤海区灌溉工程的四大重点之一（其他三个重点为滦河、海河及南运河地区），全部工程系由渤海区农垦管理局所属蓟运河灌溉工程处领导。蓟运河下游，原是一片广阔的盐碱荒地，土壤系冲积层黄土，土质肥沃，但稍含碱性。一九三八年抗战初期，日寇曾强买芦台附近大艇庄等十八村民地五万二千多亩，辟为农场，同时，兴建电力扬水场七处，利用蓟运河水洗碱、种稻。抗战胜利以后，这些扬水设备遭到日寇和国民党匪军的两度破坏，电动机全部遗失，水泵破坏殆尽，厂房设备亦仅剩下断壁颓垣。土地也大部荒芜。一九四九年平、津解放后，该农场便由津沽农垦管理局（现改为渤海区农垦管理局）接管。该局接管后，立即筹划将高里区及芦台附近各农场同时恢复。去年十月开始修复扬水场设备工作，经十三万余民工及三万多技术工人半年的努力，至今年四月底止，除将原有七处扬水设备全部修复外，并新建八号扬水场一座，自五月一日起已开始放水。如将全部扬水场二十个水泵同时开动，每秒钟内可从蓟运河抽水二十四吨，使芦台及高里区已垦出的八万多亩盐碱地从此得到灌溉的保障。据估计，如果充分利用现有水利设备，还可增加灌溉面积三万亩以上。
    高里区国营农场共有垦地五万二千多亩，其中一万三千多亩与当地农民合作经营，已划分为南、北两个合营区。将国营区的三万多亩耕地划分为六区。为适应当地土质，该场决定采取苏联先进国家的经验，实行以水稻为主的六年轮作制，每年三区种水稻，一区种棉花，二区种牧草，六年交替耕种。同时明确规定深耕密植和水稻旱直播的耕作方法，并采用机器耕种。
    中央人民政府农业部李书城部长在放水典礼和国营农场的成立大会上的讲话中指出：蓟运河灌溉工程的修建成功和高里区国营农场的成立，证明唯有人民政府才会认真地从事对人民有利的生产事业。蓟运河灌溉工程全部是我们自己的工程师设计的，全部机器也是自造的，这个工程的建设成功，使我们对今后的生产建设事业更加增强了信心。高里区国营农场的成立，指出了我国农业的发展方向，我们应该吸取这个农场和其他国营农场的经验，以逐步地改进我们的农业生产。
