　　Simple and Labor-Saving Trench Afforestation Method
    Introducing the Afforestation Experience of the Masses in the Yongding River Area
    Li Ting
    In the Yongding River area, the masses in Daxing, Gu'an, Yongqing, and Anci counties, in addition to using the "pit-mound soil exchange method" (also known as "clump planting method") to plant poplar and willow poles for windbreak forests in spring, summer, and autumn, also popularize a "trench afforestation method" (called "plowing and planting method" by the locals) in wet years or during continuous rainy seasons. This method involves using cattle to plow a foot-deep long trench at the afforestation site (sandy wasteland). Then, densely insert one-foot-three-inch-long poplar and willow cuttings (use small cuttings less than one inch thick during the rainy season) or two-foot-long poplar and willow slips. Plow again to turn the soil ridge beside the trench into the trench, just covering the inserted branches. Stomp it firmly with your feet or pound it firmly with a large tamper, and that counts as planting a row.

    The first advantage of this method is that it is simple and labor-saving, and it can be planted quickly. One person with one head of cattle can plant five or six mu of land a day, while with the "pit-mound method," one person can plant at most half a mu (two hundred mounds) a day. The second advantage is that because the soil is loosened by plowing, the seedlings that grow up in the future are vigorous and uniform, as if they have been trimmed with knives and scissors. The grown poles are also particularly neat and even, and can be sold at a high price. The third advantage is that whether you are raising seedlings in a nursery (raising small-leaved poplar to graft large-leaved poplar or raising American poplar), or creating a mother tree forest in a wet riverside area (using current-year tender branches, cut into five-inch lengths, and scattering them into the trench in handfuls), using this method can make the seedlings grow neatly and strongly, with a survival rate of over 90%, which is better than the previous hole-drilling cutting method (according to the test results of the Pangzhen Nursery of the Yongding River Afforestation Bureau).

    The trench afforestation method is not only suitable for the afforestation of poplar and willow trees, but also for the cutting afforestation of tree species such as osier, red tamarisk, Amorpha fruticosa, and Lespedeza bicolor, which has more advantages than the hole-drilling cutting or pit-mound clump planting methods. It is recommended that all localities try it out during this year's rainy season afforestation.

　　简单省工的沟形造林法
    介绍永定河区群众的造林经验
    李霆
    永定河区大兴、固安、永清、安次各县群众在春、夏、秋三季除了用“窝墩换土法”（一名“丛植法”）植造杨柳杆子防风林以外，在地湿年头或伏雨连绵的时候，还流行一种“沟形造林法”（老乡叫“耕植法”）。这方法是在造林地点（沙荒地上）套牲口用犁耕成一尺深的长沟，密密的插上一尺三寸长的杨柳树橛子（雨季用粗一寸以下的小橛子）或二尺多长的杨柳拨子，再用犁一耕，把旁边的土埂翻进沟里，刚好把插好的枝条盖上，用脚踩实或用大杠子墩实着，就算是栽了一行。
    这方法的第一个优点是简单省工，栽的快，一人一个牲口一天能栽五、六亩地，用“窝墩法”一人一天最多只栽半亩地（二百墩）。第二个优点是由于把土壤耕松了，将来长出来的树苗子旺盛而整齐，就象是曾用刀、剪修理过了的一般。长成的杆子也特别整齐匀实，能卖大价。第三个优点是不论在苗圃里育苗（育小叶杨接大叶杨或育美杨），或在河滩湿润地营造母树林（用当年生的嫩枝条，剪成五寸来长，一把一把的撒进沟里），使用这法能使苗子生长整齐壮实，成活率高达百分之九十以上，比过去的穿孔插条法强（据永定河造林局庞镇苗圃试验结果）。
    沟形造林法不仅使用于杨柳树的造林，而且适用于杞柳、红荆、紫穗槐、胡枝子等树种的插条造林，比用穿孔插条或窝墩丛植法优点较多。各地今年雨季造林时不妨先试用一下。
