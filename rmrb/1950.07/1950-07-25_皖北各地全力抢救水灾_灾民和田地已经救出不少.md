Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd: People in various parts of northern Anhui, under the leadership of governments at all levels, are now fully engaged in rescue, dike protection, drainage, and replanting work, in order to minimize the harm of the floods. Since the beginning of July, the Huai River has breached in several places above and below Zhengyangguan. Tributaries of the Huai River in the Su County and Fuyang prefectures have also suffered from flooding over dikes in many places. In addition, rainfall along the Huai River is still heavy, making it difficult to drain the accumulated water. The flooded land along the Huai River in counties under the jurisdiction of the Fuyang, Su County, and Lu'an prefectures has reached more than 21 million mu. The disaster is most severe in the Fuyang prefecture, where 12 million mu of farmland have been flooded, and 150 villages have been completely submerged. After the floods occurred, the governments at all levels in northern Anhui and the Party committees at all levels immediately devoted all their efforts to rescue and disaster relief work, and decided to make rescue, dike protection, drainage, and replanting the overriding central tasks at present. In addition to allocating 7.9 million jin of grain for emergency relief, the Anhui North Administrative Office, led by Director Huang Yan, Deputy Director Li Yunpeng, and Flood Control Commander Zheng Baozhen, personally led cadres to Funan (southern Fuyang), Wuhe, and other counties to assist in rescue work. Zheng Baozhen went to Funan County on the 8th, and together with Li Shizhuang, Commissioner of the Fuyang Prefectural Office, Wang Guangyu, Secretary of the Fuyang Prefectural Party Committee, and a large number of cadres who accompanied him, mobilized more than 200 boats to supervise the rescue of disaster victims, livestock, and property from the water. The Lu'an Prefecture also sent more than 100 cadres and a large number of civilian boats to the disaster area for rescue. The disaster victims in Funan, Huoqiu, and other areas have now been completely rescued and are being provided with relief and resettlement.

At the same time, the people's governments in the affected areas are vigorously leading the people in blocking water, draining water, and rescuing flooded land. In Fuyang Prefecture alone, more than one million mu of farmland have now been rescued. In order to solve the problem of seeds for replanting after the water recedes, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office, in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government, has sent special personnel to Pingyuan, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces to purchase turnip, buckwheat, radish, and other seeds for the disaster victims, and has also allocated 5.8 million jin of grain to the Fuyang and Lu'an prefectures as expenses for preparing late autumn seeds.

For the Huai River dike sections that have not yet breached and the flood control work on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the Anhui North Flood Control Headquarters is currently taking further flood control measures under the leadership of the East China Flood Control Headquarters. Liu Chongguang, Deputy Minister of the East China Water Conservancy Department, arrived in Bengbu on the 13th of this month with the Anhui North Disaster Area Inspection Group. The next day, he and the Anhui North Administrative Office held an emergency meeting of commissioners and county heads of the Huai River area in Bengbu. It was decided to organize 200 rescue teams to build subsidiary dikes with 3 million cubic meters of earth on the Huai River dike below Zhengyangguan. The people in various riverside areas have already taken action. The Central People's Government has allocated 5.5 million jin of grain as expenses for this project. In addition, the East China Financial and Economic Committee has also loaned 20 million jin of grain to the Anqing, Chaohu, Lu'an, and Chuxian prefectures for flood control and production support. In order to ensure the implementation of the above tasks, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office and the Anhui North District Committee of the Communist Party of China are continuing to organize thousand-person work teams for deployment at any time. The Anhui North Military Region has dispatched a regiment and a battalion to Huoqiu, Huaiyuan, and other counties to help with flood control and rescue; another two regiments have gone to the Yangtze River coast to strengthen the flood control work of the dikes along the river.

　　皖北各地全力抢救水灾
    灾民和田地已经救出不少
    【新华社上海二十二日电】皖北各地人民，在各级人民政府领导下，现正全力投入抢险、护堤和排水、补种的工作，以期尽力减少水灾的危害。七月初以来，淮河在正阳关上下已有多处决堤，宿县和阜阳两专区内淮河的支流，也有多处洪水漫堤成灾。加以淮河沿线的雨量仍大，积水难排，淮河两岸阜阳、宿县、六安三专区所属各县，被淹土地已达两千一百多万亩。其中以阜阳专区的灾情最重，被淹田禾达一千二百万亩，连房屋全淹者有一百五十个乡。水灾发生后，皖北各级人民政府与中共各级党委，立即全力投入了抢险、救灾的工作，决定以抢险、护堤、排水、补种作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。皖北行署除拨粮七百九十万斤进行急救外，行署主任黄岩、副主任李云鹏、防汛总指挥郑抱真等均亲率干部赶赴阜南（阜阳南部）、五河等县协助抢救工作。郑抱真于八日赴阜南县，会同阜阳专署专员李时庄、中共阜阳地委书记王光宇及随往该地的大批干部，调集二百余船只，督导抢救水中的灾民、牲口和财粮。六安专区也派出百余干部及大批民船赴灾区抢救。现阜南、霍邱一带灾民已经全部救出，正分别救济安置中。
    同时，受灾地区人民政府正大力领导人民进行堵水、排水，抢救被水淹没的土地。仅阜阳一个专区现在即已救出田地百余万亩。为解决各地灾民在水退后进行补种时的种籽问题，皖北人民行署除遵照中央人民政府电令，派专人分赴平原、河北、河南、山东等省为灾民代购芜菁、荞麦、葫萝卜等种子外，又拨给阜阳、六安两专区五百八十万斤粮食作为筹办晚秋种籽的费用。
    对于尚未决堤的淮河堤段及长江北岸的防汛工作，皖北防汛指挥部刻正在华东防汛总指挥部领导下，作进一步的防汛措施。华东水利部副部长刘宠光已于本月十三日率皖北灾区视察团到达蚌埠，次日即协同皖北行署在蚌埠召开了沿淮河地区专员、县长的紧急会议。决定组织二百个抢险队，以三百万方土在正阳关以下之淮河堤上加修子堤。现沿河各地人民已经行动起来。中央人民政府已拨出粮食五百五十万斤作为进行此项工程的费用。此外，华东财委会亦贷粮二千万斤，分配给安庆、巢湖、六安、滁县等四专区，用以防汛和扶植生产。为保证上述任务的进行，皖北人民行署及中共皖北区党委正继续组织千人工作队准备随时调用。皖北军区则调部队一团又一营分赴霍邱、怀远等县帮助防洪抢险；另两个团赴长江沿岸，以加强沿江圩坝的防汛工作。
