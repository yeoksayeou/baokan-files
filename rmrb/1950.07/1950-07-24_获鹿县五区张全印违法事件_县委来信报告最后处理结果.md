　　Zhang Quanyin's Illegal Activities in the Fifth District of Huolu County
　　Letter from County Party Committee Reporting Final Outcome
Editor's Note:

　　Zhang Xilai, a farmer from Beigaoji Village in the Fifth District of Huolu County, wrote to this newspaper reflecting the situation of Zhang Quanyin, a cadre in their village, who was engaged in corruption, rape, and oppression of the masses. We requested the Huolu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to investigate. According to the investigation results, the facts reflected in Zhang Xilai's letter were basically correct. The investigation process and handling opinions were also told to this newspaper (already published in the June 3rd issue of this publication). Recently, the Huolu County Committee has sent another letter reporting the final outcome of the incident.
Comrade Editor:

　　On June 3rd, after the People's Garden published the County Party Committee's handling opinions on Zhang Quanyin's illegal facts in Beigaoji, Fifth District, the County People's Government immediately summoned Zhang Quanyin and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment in accordance with the law.

　　We criticized Feng Sanchun, the Secretary of the Fifth District Party Committee, and others for lacking in-depth inspection, avoiding difficulties, and failing to handle Zhang Quanyin's problem in a timely manner (the two individuals' self-criticisms are below - Editor).

　　Farmer Zhang Xilai's letter of accusation to the People's Garden was helpful to our county's work. After our in-depth inspection, we also discovered that many cadres were engaged in corruption, violating the Party's policies and government decrees. The root cause is that the County Party Committee's leadership had a bureaucratic work style and lacked systematic and comprehensive inspection work, which led to certain cadres violating the law, oppressing the masses, and harming the interests of the people.

　　In the future, in addition to strengthening inspection work in a planned manner, we plan to conduct inspections during the Party rectification and cadre consolidation.

　　Feng Sanchun and Liu Jinghe's Self-Criticisms

　　Since the newspaper published the illegal problems of Zhang Quanyin in our district and received the instruction letter from the county, we have reviewed this issue and believe that the occurrence of this problem is greatly related to our leadership. The main errors are as follows:

　　District leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style. We knew about Zhang Quanyin's problems before, but we did not conduct a good inspection, which led to the problem developing to a serious degree. The reason is that we "avoid difficulties" in our work, only care about completing tasks, and are not good at seriously solving problems. Regarding the Xiying problem, we only felt that the work could barely pass, and the masses did not openly oppose it, so we did not deal with it. This kind of work attitude of not seriously and solemnly dealing with problems and perfunctorily shirking responsibility must be overcome with determination in the future.

　　We have a simplistic talent-based view of Zhang Quanyin. When Zhang Quanyin was the village chief last year, he refused a widow to bring her property and carried out beatings. When we dealt with it, we only kept him in the district for three days of introspection before sending him back to be the village chief. There was also an occasion when Zhang Quanyin scolded our district cadres who went to the countryside, and we did not deal with it. We mistakenly believed in our minds that Zhang Quanyin was "capable," and the work in Xiying could not be done without him. Under the control of this muddled and wrong thinking, we condoned Zhang Quanyin, resulting in serious adverse consequences for the people.

　　Today, we have accepted this profound lesson. In the future, we must conduct in-depth inspections of our work and deal with it seriously in order to improve the work in our district.

### 获鹿县五区张全印违法事件  县委来信报告最后处理结果

　　获鹿县五区张全印违法事件
   县委来信报告最后处理结果编者按：
    获鹿县五区北高基农民张喜来写信给本报，反映他们村中干部张全印贪污腐化、强奸妇女、欺压群众的情况。我们请中共获鹿县委会调查。据调查结果，张喜来来信所反映的事实基本上是正确的。并将调查经过和处理意见告诉了本报（已载六月三日本刊）。日前获鹿县委会又来信报告该事件的最后处理结果。编辑同志：
    六月三日，人民园地发表了县委对五区北高基张全印违法事实的处理意见以后，县人民政府即传讯张全印，并依法判处了他二年徒刑。
    我们对五区区委书记冯三春等因缺乏深入检查，避难就易，致使张全印问题未及时处理，进行了批评（两人的检讨见后——编者）。
    农民张喜来给人民园地的这封控诉信，对我县工作是有帮助的。经我们深入检查工作后，还发现不少干部贪污腐化，违反党的政策及政府法令的事实。究其原因，正是县委领导上存有官僚主义作风，缺乏系统全面的检查工作，致使某些干部违法欺压群众，危害了人民的利益。
    今后除有计划地加强检查工作外，拟在整党整干中进行检查。
                                       中共获鹿县委会
    冯三春、刘景和的检讨
    自报上登出我区张全印的不法问题和接到县方的指示信以后，我们已对此问题作了检讨，并认为此问题的发生和我们领导上有很大关系，其主要的错误有以下几点：
    区领导干部有官僚主义作风。张全印的问题以前我们就知道一些，但没有很好进行检查，以致发展到严重的地步。原因是我们工作上“避难就易”，只顾完成工作，不善于认真解决问题。对西营问题只觉得工作还能凑合过去，群众没有公开起来反对，所以就没去处理。这种不认真严肃处理问题，敷衍塞责的工作态度，今后一定要痛下决心加以克服。
    我们对张全印有单纯人材观点的看法。去年张全印当村长时，曾拒绝寡妇带产，施行殴打，我们在处理时只是把他留在区里反省了三天，就送他回去当村长了。还有一次张全印大骂我们下乡的区干部，我们也没有处理。我们思想上错误地认为张全印“能干”，西营工作没他就作不成。在这种糊涂错误的思想支配下，就对张全印姑息迁就下去。以致造成不利于人民群众的严重恶果。
    今天我们已经接受了这种深刻的教训，今后我们一定要深入检查工作，认真处理，以改善我区的工作。
