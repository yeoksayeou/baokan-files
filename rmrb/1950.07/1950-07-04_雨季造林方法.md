Afforestation Methods for the Rainy Season
　　Huang Shu
　　I. What Trees to Plant and How to Plant Them
　　What trees are good to plant during the rainy season? In sandy and dry areas, it is suitable to plant poplar, willow, and red sandbar willow; in humid river滩堤banks, it is suitable to plant poplar, willow, reeds, and cogongrass; in alkaline soil, it is suitable to plant red sandbar willow, wolfberry, and basket willow by layering or cutting; in lower mountainous areas, it is suitable to plant wild jujube, jujube trees, wild pear, and Chinese pear; in high mountain areas, plant pine, cypress, and spruce seedlings, as well as sowing small seeds such as ailanthus, vitex, elm, maple, and lespedeza on hillsides; in sandy areas, sow amorpha fruticosa, lespedeza, sophora davidii (bitter ginseng), and bassia scoparia shrubs and perennial grasses.
　　How to plant them? Different tree species and different methods should be used in different regions.
　　(1) Dry Sandy Areas
　　1. Layering poplar and willow branches (压卜子) is best done with Populus simonii and red sandbar willow, followed by willow (willow grows poorly in dry and barren sandy soil). Branches of the current year or the previous year are most likely to survive. Overly old branches are not suitable, and planting thick branches is even less likely to succeed. Generally, cross-layering or direct insertion methods are used. Both poplar and willow use the arched layering method, but the arch back must be two inches above the ground, and the soil should not be completely filled, leaving a three-inch deep pool for water storage.
　　2. Planting wild jujube trees, jujube, and wild pear seedlings: It is best to use wild seedlings separated from the roots of large trees in the current year or the previous year. Older seedlings are not easy to survive. When digging up seedlings, bring as many roots as possible, and choose stronger ones. The planting method is the same as in spring. After filling the soil, leave a small pool on the pit surface to store rainwater.
　　3. Sowing amorpha fruticosa, lespedeza (抗条), sophora davidii (bitter ginseng), bassia scoparia (铁扫帚) and other shrubs and perennial herbs: Amorpha fruticosa and lespedeza can be directly spot-sown or strip-sown in relatively good sandy soil before or after rain (sowing after rain with seeds that have been soaked). Cover with three minutes of soil, and they can take root a foot deep in the same year. Sow sophora davidii and bassia scoparia in sandy wasteland after rain, covering the soil slightly shallower. After two years, cut them down for firewood every year, and they will grow back the following year, providing a windbreak effect.
　　(2) Humid Sand Beaches Along the River
　　1. Populus simonii, willow, basket willow (杞柳), red sandbar willow (标柳 or 山川柳), etc., are easy to survive using the "cross-layering method" or direct insertion method. The branches used should be about the thickness of a finger. Planting overly thick branches can easily lead to the peeling of branches and trunks in winter. After rain, it is best to plant wild seedlings of Populus simonii, red sandbar willow, and willow on the river beach for easy survival.
　　2. Layering reeds and cogongrass: During the dog days of summer, cut down the entire reed stalk and lay it flat on the moist sand beach, pressing a shovelful of soil on it every other section. Or dig a shallow ditch more than three inches deep and bury the reed stalk with leaves, and it will quickly sprout and root. Cut down the entire cogongrass plant and insert it on the bank or wet beach, and it will easily survive. Also, reed roots are often washed down from the river during the rainy season, collect them and press them on the beach for easy survival.
　　(3) Alkaline Soil
　　1. Creating red sandbar willow forests: Red sandbar willow is an alkali-resistant small tree that can grow in general soil (except for dead alkaline soil). To plant red sandbar willow, the land must be prepared well. Before afforestation, make ridges two feet wide and one and a half to two feet high every five feet in the alkaline soil, and then plant on the ridges according to the following methods:
　　(1) Cutting method: Cut the red sandbar willow (preferably two years old) with the thickness of a thumb into sections about a foot long (do not use the end that is too thin), and then dig pits on the slopes on both sides of the ridge every five feet, staggering them. Place three or four branches in each pit in a triangular or square shape, exposing about an inch above the ground, cover with soil and tamp firmly. Start cutting the branches only after three years of growth, cutting the branches close to the roots every year. In loose sandy soil, the direct insertion method can be used, sharpening the lower end of the branch into a horseshoe shape, using an iron foot stirrup to punch a hole, and inserting it into the ground, which is more labor-saving.
　　(2) Planting seedlings: There are often many naturally grown red sandbar willow seedlings scattered throughout the barren alkaline land. During the rainy season, dig up these small seedlings with roots and soil from places where they are growing too densely and plant them on the ridges of the afforestation area. They are easy to survive.
　　(3) Sowing method: In alkaline wasteland with large red sandbar willow (seed-bearing), the land can be prepared and ridges built. After the red sandbar willow seeds mature, they will fall on the ridges with the wind. After the rainy season, the seeds will germinate and grow. Artificial sowing can also be used, that is, scattering freshly matured seeds all over the ground in wetter areas. After the rain, they will germinate.
　　Of the above three methods, the cutting method is better. After three years of cuttings, each mound can produce three catties of red sandbar willow branches. Three hundred mounds can be planted per mu, and nine hundred catties can be produced annually after three years, which can be exchanged for more than one hundred catties of millet. Planting crops in this kind of alkaline land yields less than thirty catties of grain per year, but planting red sandbar willow is less labor-intensive and yields several times more than planting crops.
　　2. Planting wolfberry: Wolfberry is very alkali-resistant and can be planted in general alkaline wasteland. The seeds can be used for medicinal purposes and are very valuable. Before the war, large quantities were shipped south and sold to the Nanyang Islands. Wolfberry produced in Dacheng and Qing County, Hebei, could be exchanged for thirty catties of wheat or one thousand eight hundred catties of millet per mu in 1949 (Ningxia wolfberry production per mu could be exchanged for one thousand five hundred catties of millet), far exceeding the income from planting crops. There are two methods of wolfberry propagation:
　　(1) Sowing method: In the first year, pick the ripe fruits, soak them in cold water, rub off the pulp, scoop out the seeds, dry them, and store them. Before Tomb-Sweeping Day in the second year, sow the seeds in the garden like planting vegetables to cultivate seedlings. In the spring or rainy season of the third year, use one-year-old seedlings, dig pits five feet apart, with rows five feet wide, put three or four seedlings in each pit, cover with soil and tamp firmly, and water every ten days or so. The plants will bear fruit after two years of planting.
　　(2) Division method: Wolfberry roots produce many small seedlings. During the continuous伏rains, choose small seedlings about a foot tall, dig them up with roots, and plant them while it is raining. This method is simple and easy to implement, but the future fruit yield will be sparser, and the fruit grains will be larger.
　　3. Planting basket willow forests: Basket willow, also known as 簸箕柳 or柳子, is an alkali-resistant small tree with slender and soft branches that are harvested once a year, growing more than five feet tall. It is mostly cultivated on alkaline beaches by the river (called河滩柳) and silted sandy land (called旱地柳). The planting method is similar to the method of inserting red sandbar willow. It is best to use an iron foot stirrup to punch holes, with one person punching holes and another inserting branches. Cut it flat on the ground, and one branch can be inserted into three plants, without using the thin tip. One person uses a large rammer to tamp it firmly, insert it seven inches deep in wet ground, and one and a half feet deep in dry ground, with plants eight inches apart, inserting them ridge by ridge or in parallel ridges. Cover with two iron hoes of soil in the autumn of the first year to prevent freezing, and then dig them up the following spring.
　　(4) Mountainous Areas
　　1. Sowing seeds for afforestation on barren mountains:
　　(1) In spring and the rainy season, sow seeds with thin skins and small grains that are easy to germinate, such as vitex, lespedeza (抗条), and ailanthus. Due to the spring drought in North China, seeds sown in dry mountainous areas in spring will only germinate during the rainy season. If sowing in the rainy season, it is best to soak the seeds in warm water immediately during heavy rain. Once the rain stops, the seeds will be soaked through, and sowing should be done immediately. Germination and emergence occur in three to five days, making it easiest to succeed. For large-scale sowing, it can be sown before the rain. Various tree species can be sown after autumn. Hard-shelled fruits and nuts, after freezing and thawing in the soil during winter, will easily germinate the following spring.
　　(2) Shady slopes receive less sunlight and are more humid than sunny slopes. It is easier to plant in shady slopes with thick soil and grass.
　　(3) On mountain slopes with thinner soil, first sow drought-resistant tree species such as vitex, ailanthus, lespedeza, aurcularia auricula-judae, and gleditsia sinensis. On mountain roots, slopes and newly reclaimed slopes with thicker soil, sow koelreuteria paniculata (乌拉叶), pistacia chinensis (黄连木), wild peach, wild apricot, oak, amorpha fruticosa, and elm. Pine and cypress grow slowly, and direct sowing is not easy to succeed. It is better to use one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half-year-old seedlings for afforestation during the rainy season. In thick and humid high mountains, direct sowing of larch (材树) and spruce (杆树) in spring can also succeed.
　　(4) When sowing, the participants must be well organized, with two people in a group, one holding a hoe and the other holding tree seeds. Form a team from the top of the mountain downwards, walking horizontally along the mountainside, with rows three to five feet apart. In each row, dig a round pit every three feet, seven inches wide and five inches deep. Place ten to twenty small seeds in each pit; place three larger pits such as wild peach nuts. Cover small seeds with four minutes of soil; cover fruit pits with one inch of soil, and tamp them all firmly.
　　(5) The sown areas must be protected, grazing prohibited, and nurtured into forests.
　　2. Planting trees for afforestation on barren mountains:
　　(1) The season for planting trees on barren mountains: Barren mountains in North China are very dry. Except for places that are close to mountain gullies, humid mountain roots, or convenient for watering, where fruit trees can be planted in spring or after autumn, only transplanting during the dog days of summer is easy to succeed and does not require watering.
　　(2) What trees to plant on barren mountains: In addition to planting some economic tree species such as zanthoxylum bungeanum, walnut, pistacia chinensis, and jujube in places with thick soil at the mountain roots and on slopes, it is best to plant platycladus orientalis, pinus tabulaeformis, sabina chinensis, and spruce during the rainy season, with a survival rate of 70% to 80%. Platycladus orientalis is the best.
　　(3) Planting method: Dig pits on the hillside before the伏雨rainy season to store water and allow it to seep into the soil. The pits should be one foot wide and one foot five inches deep. Plant two or three seedlings that are one-and-a-half to three-and-a-half years old in each pit (platycladus orientalis is best with a one-and-a-half-year-old seedling one foot tall), spreading them out. After a thorough rain, take advantage of continuous overcast days to mobilize forces for planting. Seedlings must be dug up and planted immediately, without transporting them far or leaving them for a long time. Dig pits horizontally along the mountainside, with each pit three feet apart, and the upper and lower rows four to five feet apart. Pay attention to dense planting to maintain moisture and soil, and promote vigorous growth. The planting depth should be about one inch deeper than the original soil mark, ensuring that the roots are stretched out, covered with soil, and tamped firmly. In places with natural spruce forests, wild seedlings five or six inches tall can be transplanted into the forest.
　　(5) Others
　　Transplanting ulmus pumila, populus nigra, sophora japonica, robinia pseudoacacia, ailanthus altissima, platycladus orientalis, and jujube seedlings during continuous rainy days. Small seedlings of the current year and the previous year are easy to survive. Seedlings must have one-third to one-half of their branches cut off to facilitate survival. Larger seedlings are required for planting roadside trees, which is safer in early spring and after autumn. Therefore, planting roadside trees and sporadic planting of trees during the rainy season is not recommended.
　　II. Technical Considerations
　　(1) Planting trees in the rainy season must grasp the season. Generally, it is best to plant or sow after a thorough rain has fallen from the beginning of the first伏dog day to the second伏dog day, taking advantage of continuous rainy days. Planting jujube and wild pear is suitable during the first伏dog day; layering poplar and willow branches during the first and second伏dog days; layering reeds and inserting cogongrass during the second伏dog day; inserting basket willow around the beginning of autumn. Sowing for afforestation should be done at the beginning of the first伏dog day, or even a little earlier. After the second伏dog day, all kinds of tree planting and afforestation are too late.
　　(2) The preparation of seedlings, seeds, afforestation land, and organizational division of labor must be done in advance. Because trees grow most vigorously during the rainy season, seedlings should be cut and planted immediately, without leaving them for a long time. The transportation of seedlings should not be too far, and there should be people in charge at both ends of places one or two 十里 apart, namely cutting, transporting, and planting immediately.
　　(3) Layering branches in the rainy season should use tender branches of the current year and last year; planting trees should use seedlings of the current year and last year; sowing should use tree seeds with thin skins and small grains. This allows them to germinate, grow, and become strong quickly, making it easier to survive the winter. Whether sowing, layering, or planting trees in the rainy season, do not fill the soil completely, leaving a small pool to store rainwater and improve the survival rate. When planting broad-leaved tree seedlings such as jujube trees, Chinese scholar trees, and wild pears, it is best to cut off the tender shoots to enhance drought resistance.

　　雨季造林方法
    黄舒
    一、栽什么树和怎样栽
    雨季栽什么树好呢？在沙荒干燥地宜栽杨、柳、红荆；湿润河滩堤岸宜栽杨、柳、苇、荻；在碱地宜栽红荆、枸杞、杞柳等压条或插枝造林；在较低山地宜植酸枣、枣树、杜梨、奈子；在高山地区栽植松、柏、杄（云杉）等针叶树小苗，以及在山坡播种臭椿、荆条、榆、枫、胡枝子等小粒种籽；在沙荒播种紫穗槐、胡枝子、野槐花（苦参）和马扫等灌木与宿根草。
    怎样栽呢？不同地区要使用不同树种和不同方法。
    （一）干燥沙荒
    １、压杨柳条子（压卜子）最好用小叶杨、红荆，其次是柳树（柳树在干瘠沙地生长较差）。以当年或去年生的枝条最易成活。过老不相宜，插粗杆更不好活，一般用交叉压条法，或直插法，杨柳都用弓形压条法，但弓背须高出地面二寸，填土不填满，留三寸深的水池。
    ２、栽酸枣树、枣与杜树苗：最好用当年或前一年由大树根上分叶出来的野生苗，太老不易活。起苗时多带根，选壮一点的，栽法跟春季一样，填土后坑面留一小池子，准备积存雨水。
    ３、播种紫穗槐、胡枝子（抗条）、野槐花（苦参）、马扫（铁扫帚）等灌木及宿根草类：紫穗槐、胡枝子可于雨前或雨后选较好的沙地，直接点种或条播（雨后用已经浸透的种籽播种），盖土三分厚，当年可扎根一尺来深。野槐、马扫趁雨后播在沙荒地，盖土稍浅，二年以后，每年割下做柴火，第二年重新长出来，有挡风的效用。
    （二）沿河湿润沙滩
    １、小叶杨、柳树、柳子（杞柳）、红荆（标柳或称山川柳）等用“交叉压条法”或直插法，都易成活。条子也用手指粗的。栽太粗的杆子到冬季容易脱枝干皮。雨后在河滩宜植小叶杨、红荆及柳树的野生苗最好活。
    ２、压苇子、荻子：二伏天把苇杆整个割下来，平卧湿润的沙滩上，隔一节压上一铁锨土。或挖三寸多深的小沟，把苇杆带叶埋上，很快便发芽出根。荻子整棵割下插在堤畔或湿上滩，都易活。又雨季河中常有苇根冲下来，收集起来压在滩上最易成活。
   （三）碱地
    １、造红荆林：红荆是一种耐碱性的小树，在一般地里（除死碱地外），都能生长。栽红荆要整好地，造林前在碱地里每隔五尺，作宽二尺、高一尺半到二尺的土埝，然后按下面几种方法，在土埝上栽种：
    （１）插条法：把拇指粗的红荆（最好是满二年生的），切成一尺来长一段（末端过细的不要），然后在土埝两边的斜坡上，每隔五尺错着挖坑，每坑放入三、四根条，成三角形，或正方形，露出地面一寸左右，覆土踩实，栽上后长满三年才开始割条，每年贴着根部把条割下。在疏松的沙土地栽植，可采用直接插入法，把条下端削成马蹄形，用铁脚蹬穿孔，插入地中，更为省工。
    （２）栽苗法：荒碱地内常有很多天然生的红荆幼苗，散布各地，雨期在生长过密的地方，把这些小苗连根带土掘起来，栽在造林地的土埝上，很好活。
    （３）播种法：有大红荆（结籽）的碱荒地，可整地修土埝，红荆种籽成熟后，就随风落在土埝上，经雨期后，种籽就能发芽生长。也可用人工播种，就是在较湿润的地里，满地撒上刚成熟的种籽，等下雨后，就能发芽。
    以上三种方法，以插条法较好。插条满三年后，每墩能出三斤荆条，每亩能种三百墩，三年后每年能产九百斤，能换小米一百多斤。这种碱地种庄稼，每年收获不到三十斤粮食，种红荆既不费工，比种庄稼还多收好几倍。
    ２、种枸杞：枸杞耐碱性很强，一般碱荒地都能种，种籽可作药用，价值很贵，战前大批南运，远销南洋群岛一带，河北大城、青县所产枸杞，一九四九年每斤能换小麦三十斤，每亩六十斤，能换小米一千八百斤（宁夏枸杞每亩产量能换小米一千五百斤），远过于种庄稼的收入。枸杞繁殖法有二种：
    （１）播种法：头年把成熟果子采下后，在凉水中浸透，搓去皮肉，捞去种籽，晾干后藏好。到第二年清明节前，在园地里跟种菜一样，播种育苗。第三年春季或雨季用满一年生的苗，按五尺远一棵，五尺宽一行，挖好坑，每坑放入三、四根树秧，覆土踩实后，每隔十来天浇水一次，栽后满二年就可结果。
    （２）分株法：枸杞根部孳生小苗很多，当伏雨连绵中，选一尺来高的小苗，带根刨出来，趁雨栽上，此法简单易行，但将来结果较稀，果粒较大。
    ３、栽造杞柳林：杞柳又称簸箕柳或柳子，是一种耐碱的小树，枝条细软，每年收割一回，能长五尺多高，多栽培在河边的碱滩上（称河滩柳）和淤积的沙地上（称旱地柳）。栽法和插红荆的方法类似，最好用铁脚蹬子穿孔，一人穿孔一人插条。齐地皮割下来，一根能插三棵，细尖不用。一人用大杠子蹾实，湿地插七寸，干地得一尺五，八寸远一棵，一垅一垅的插或并垅插，头年秋后怕冻，要盖两铁镢土，次春再刨开。
    （四）山地
    １、荒山播种造林：
    （１）春季和雨季要播皮薄粒小，易发芽的树籽，如荆条、胡枝子（抗条）、臭椿等，由于华北春旱，春季在干燥山地播种也要到雨季发芽，如果在雨季播种，最好在大雨时，马上用温水浸种，雨住了种籽也浸透了，马上播种。三两天即发芽出土，最易成功。大量播种时，可在雨前播上，秋后播种各样树种都可以，硬壳果核，在土中经冬季一冻一化，明春容易发芽。
    （２）阴坡少受阳光，较阳坡湿润，可选阴坡上土厚有草的地方先播，较易成活。
    （３）土较薄的山坡，先播荆条、臭椿、胡枝子、金鸡耳、山皂荚等耐干瘠的树种，山根坡埝及新退坡地，土较厚的地方，播种栾树（乌拉叶）、青子（黄连木）、山桃、山杏、橡树、紫穗槐、榆树等。松柏生长较慢，直接播种不易成功，不如用一年半至二年半生的小苗，在雨季造林。在土厚湿润的高山，春季直接播种落叶松（材树）、云杉（杆树）等，也能成功。
    （４）播种时期，要把参加的人组织好，两人一组，一拿镢头，一拿树籽。从山上向下站队，平着山腰走，上下三五尺远一行，一行中每隔三尺刨一圆坑，宽七寸深五寸，小籽每坑十—二十粒；山桃等较大的核，放三粒。小籽盖四分厚的土；果核盖上一寸的土，都要踩实。
    （５）播种的地方必须禁山，禁止放牧，保育成林。
    ２、山荒植树造林：
    （１）荒山植树的季节：华北荒山很干燥，除靠山沟、山根湿润的或浇水方便的地方，可在春季或秋后栽种果木外，只有利用伏雨时期移栽，才易成活，且可不用浇水。
    （２）荒山上植什么树：除山根土厚的地方及坡埝上可植些花椒、核桃、青子、枣等经济树种外，一般以用侧柏、油松、刺柏、杄（云杉）等，在雨季栽植最好，成活率能达百分之七十至百分之八十。而以侧柏为最好。
    （３）植树方法：伏雨前先在山坡上挖坑，以备下雨盛水，渗入土中，坑宽一尺，深至一尺五寸，用一年半至三年半生的小苗（侧柏用一年半生高一尺的苗最好），每坑散开栽两三棵，透雨以后，趁连阴天起苗突击造林，苗木须即起即栽，不要远运久放，顺着山腰水平挖坑，坑与坑各距三尺，上下两行相距四至五尺，注意必须密植，才能保持湿气与土壤，生长旺盛，植树深度比原来土印约深一寸，要使根舒展，填土踩实，有杄树天然林的地方，可移植林中五、六寸高的野生苗。
    （五）其他
    趁连雨天移植家榆、大叶杨、中国槐、洋槐、臭椿、侧柏、枣树苗，当年及前一年生的小苗，都易成活。移树苗须要切去三分之一至二分之一的枝杆，才易成活。栽行道树须较大苗子，以在早春及秋后较为安全，所以雨季不要提倡栽行道树及零星栽树。
     二、技术上应注意的事项
    （一）雨季栽树必须掌握季节。一般自头伏起到二伏期间下过一场透雨后，趁连雨天栽植或播种最好。栽枣、杜梨宜头伏；压杨柳条在头伏与二伏；压苇插荻在二伏，插柳子在立秋前后。播种造林在头伏初，或更早一点，一过二伏，各种植树造林就都晚了。
    （二）事先必须作好树苗、树种、造林地以及组织分工等工作。因为雨季树木生长最旺，栽树苗要现砍现栽，不要久放。调剂树栽别走的太远，相距一、二十里的地方，两头要有人掌握，即砍、即送、即栽。
    （三）雨季压条要用当年及去年生的嫩条；栽树要用当年及去年生的幼苗；播种要用皮薄粒小的树籽。这样可很快发芽生长、壮实，好过冬。雨季不论播种、压条或栽树，填土时都不要填满，留个小池子好积存雨水，提高成活率。栽枣树、中国槐、杜梨等阔叶树苗时，最好都把嫩梢切掉，加强耐旱力。
