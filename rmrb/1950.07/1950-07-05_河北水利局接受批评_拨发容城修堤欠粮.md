Hebei Water Conservancy Bureau Accepts Criticism, Allocates Arrears for Dike Repair in Rongcheng

Editor:

After the "People's Garden" published Comrade Wen Nai's letter "Rongcheng People Dissatisfied with Delayed Dike Repair Fees" on June 8th, we not only allocated the grain arrears for blocking the breach to the Rongcheng County People's Government for repayment to the masses on June 14th, but also conducted a profound review of this issue within our bureau. Now, we are informing you of our review and the details of this incident, hoping it will be published.

In August and December of last year, when the government blocked two breaches in the Chen Yangzhuang dike section of the Juma River and the Zhao Village section of the Daqing River in Rongcheng County, Hebei, a total of over one million catties of rice were used. At that time, the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau only allocated over 600,000 catties of rice, owing the masses over 400,000 catties of rice for materials such as piles and firewood, and wages. On February 14th of this year, cadres from Rongcheng County reported the accounts to our bureau. At that time, our bureau was arranging the spring construction tasks for 1950, and the work was quite busy, so we did not give them practical guidance and assistance. Cadres from the county did not know how to handle many procedures. We did not provide prior instructions on how to collect and report funds and grain, but emphasized procedures when the accounts were reported, without understanding the difficulties in the actual work of lower-level cadres. If something did not meet the requirements, we did not explain the reason or provide guidance. This is a manifestation of bureaucracy. After our bureau calculated and audited the grain funds spent on blocking the breaches in Zhao Village and Chen Yangzhuang along with the Nan Shizhuang breach in the Luan River, it was submitted to the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy for reimbursement on May 3rd. At that time, the Finance Committee had decided not to allocate funds for 1949, but this issue had to be resolved. Therefore, the Finance Department of the Ministry of Water Conservancy verbally instructed our bureau to repay the arrears from the inventory of 1949. Later, our bureau delayed for another month because it did not receive written instructions from the Ministry of Water Conservancy, until the matter was reported in the newspaper on June 8th, which aroused the attention of our bureau. This is a concrete manifestation of our bureau's procrastination, lack of understanding of the actual situation at the lower level, and lack of concern for the interests of the masses. We fully accept the newspaper's criticism of us. In addition, some of the contents of Comrade Wen Nai's letter do not entirely conform to the facts, and are explained as follows: Comrade Wen Nai's letter said that when Rongcheng County cadres reported the accounts to the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau told them, "We forgot this account when we reported the general account to the central government." When our bureau investigated this matter, all comrades said that they had not said this. At that time, the comrades in our bureau said: "The central government has already settled the accounts for spring construction and flood prevention in 1949. This account must be submitted to the Ministry of Water Conservancy for approval before it can be resolved." As for saying that the comrades of the Water Conservancy Bureau did not tell the Rongcheng cadres when they must clear the accounts, it is also not in line with the facts. In order to settle the procedures for 1949 immediately, our bureau repeatedly told them in person to clear the accounts within half a month. Afterwards, Han Zhiqing from the Daqing River was also sent to Rongcheng to supervise the handling of this matter. However, in any case, we are at fault. We will definitely pay attention to correcting it.

### 河北水利局接受批评  拨发容城修堤欠粮

　　河北水利局接受批评  拨发容城修堤欠粮编辑同志：
    六月八日人民园地登出文乃同志所写“容城民众不满拖欠修堤费”的信以后，我们除于六月十四日将堵口欠粮拨发容城县人民政府偿还群众外，并将此问题在本局作了深刻的检讨。今将我们的检讨，及此一事件的经过告诉你们，希望予以发表。
    去年八月与十二月，政府在河北容城县堵塞拒马河陈杨庄堤段及大清河赵村段两道决口时，总计用米一百余万斤。当时河北省水利局只拨给了六十余万斤米，欠下群众的桩料、柴料、工资等合米四十余万斤。今年二月十四日容城县干部到本局报账，当时本局正布置一九五○年的春工任务，工作相当繁忙，致未予以切实指导与帮助。好多手续，县里来的干部不知如何搞。我们对领款报款，领粮报粮的办法，预先未作指示，到报账时却强调手续，不体会下级干部实际工作中的困难。不合手续，亦不说明原因，不指示办法。这是一种官僚主义的表现。及至本局将赵村及陈杨庄与滦河南石庄堵口所支出的粮款计算、审核完毕后，于五月三日汇呈中央水利部报销。当时财委已决定不再拨付一九四九年粮款，但这问题又不能不予解决，因此当时水利部财务处曾口头指示本局，由一九四九年存料内偿还此笔欠款。后来本局因未接到水利部的文字指示，又拖延了一个月，直至六月八日报纸登出这个事情时，才引起了本局的重视。这是本局办事拖拉，不了解下级实际情况，对群众利益不关心的具体表现。我们完全接受报纸对我们的批评。此外文乃同志的信中尚有一些不尽符合事实之处，一并说明如下：文乃同志的信里说，容城县干部到水利局报账时，水利局对他们说“向中央报总账时忘了这笔账。”本局检查此事时，全体同志都说未说过此话。当时本局同志是这样说的：“一九四九年春工防汛的账，中央已经结了，这笔账要呈请水利部批示后始能解决”。至于说水利局同志没有告诉容城干部必须在什么时候报清账款，亦不符事实。本局为了即时结清一九四九年手续，曾当面再三嘱咐他们务必于半月内报清。以后，并曾派大清河韩志清到容城督促办理此事。不过无论如何，我们是有错误的。我们一定注意改正。
    河北省水利局
