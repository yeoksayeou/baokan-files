Significant Reduction in Waste Rate at Newly Built Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory

[Report from this newspaper] The product quality of the newly built chemical pharmaceutical factory in Beijing has significantly improved in the first half of June, with no medicine being spoiled. Especially in the production of injections, the past yield of qualified products for 1 cc ampoules was only 88%, for 10 cc ampoules, 80%, and for 500 cc and 300 cc ampoules, the highest was only 40%. Some medicines could not be made even after one or two attempts. Especially for 500 cc and 300 cc ampoules, due to unfamiliarity with operating procedures and unclean ampoule washing, the prepared solutions did not meet the standards, resulting in repeated failures. This caused serious waste of raw materials and labor. The products in the first half of June have changed the above situation, with 1 cc ampoules reaching 96%, 10 cc ampoules reaching 84.8%, and 500 cc and 300 cc ampoules improving to 55% to 60%, and the quality is good. This achievement is unprecedented since the establishment of the factory. The main reason for the above achievements is that the workers and technicians of the compounding department recognized the seriousness of past waste, actively improved their skills, and improved operating procedures. For example, in washing 500 cc ampoules, only one or two ampoules were washed at a time in the past, which wasted time. After adopting the circulating washing method, the daily washing volume gradually increased from 40 to more than 120 ampoules, and Zhou Yunkai even created a record of washing 165 ampoules. The work in compounding, filling, and sealing has also been carefully attended to. When making difficult-to-produce medicines (such as epinephrine), workers not directly involved in the production of the medicine are prohibited from entering the workshop, and the medicine reaches a good standard.

In addition, Zhang Jirui of the tablet group improved some defects in the sugar coating machine, overcoming the problems of products not being smooth and colors not being bright, and can be compared with standard sugar coatings on the market. In the past, when packaging finished products in the packaging group, there were constant occurrences of forgetting to put instructions in the boxes, sand, and even pasting the wrong box labels. After implementing a dedicated responsibility system, similar phenomena are now rarely seen. Others, such as the synthesis group using small pieces of filter paper cut from scraps to replace complete filter paper; using broken-mouthed flasks as good flasks, etc., all show that all employees are fighting to further reduce and eliminate defective products and reduce production costs.

### 新建化学制药厂作废率显著减少

　　新建化学制药厂作废率显著减少
    【本报讯】京新建化学制药厂六月上半月产品质量显著提高，没有作坏一种药品。特别是作注射液方面，过去作注射液，一西西安瓿合格成品只能达到百分之八十八，十西西安瓿达百分之八十，五百西西和三百西西安瓿最高才达到百分之四十。有的药品作一次两次还作不成。特别是对五百西西和三百西西安瓿，由于操作手续不熟悉，安瓿洗不净，配制出来不合标准，三番五次打坏再作。严重地浪费了原料和人工。六月上半月的产品已改变了上述情况，一西西达到百分之九十六，十西西达到百分之八十四点八，五百西西和三百西西安瓿提高到百分之五十五至六十，并且质量良好。这种成绩是该厂建厂以来所未有过的。获得以上成绩的主要原因，是配制部的工人和技术员，认清了过去浪费的严重情形，积极提高技术，并改进了操作手续。如洗五百西西安瓿，过去一次只洗一、二支，浪费时间，经改用环流洗涤法后，由每天洗四十支，逐步提高到一百二十余支，周云楷更创造洗一百六十五支的最高纪录。在配制、灌注、封口等方面的工作，也都慎重注意起来。制作难制的药品时（如付肾素），就禁止非直接生产该药品的工人进工房，药品达到良好程度。
    另外锭剂组张继睿改进糖衣机的某些缺陷后，克服了产品不光滑、颜色不鲜亮的毛病，完全可以和市场上的标准糖衣相媲美。包装组以前包装成品时，不断发生盒里忘放说明书、砂?，甚至贴错盒签等现象。后经实行专责制，类似现象已极少见。其他如合成组利用剪下的小块滤纸，代替完整滤纸；利用坏口烧瓶当好烧瓶等，都说明全体职工都正为进一步减少和消灭废品，减低生产成本而斗争。
