Harbin Railway Section Workers Protest Truman's Shameless Statement

\tSpecial-Grade Labor Hero Yao Zhiping said: We are currently展开ing a signature campaign to defend world peace. American imperialism has openly issued a challenging statement, seeking to militarily intervene in the Korean civil war and openly invade our country's Taiwan, shamelessly saying that "the Taiwan issue awaits consideration by the United Nations." This extremely ferocious act fully exposes the true face of imperialist aggression. Taiwan is the territory of the Chinese people, and that will never change. Premier Zhou's statement precisely represents the will of the Chinese people, and we resolutely support it. The Chinese people have years of revolutionary struggle and a high degree of awareness. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have already defeated Japanese imperialism and the American-armed Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, behind us, we have the great strength of the world's peace and democracy camp. Any imperialist act of aggression will be crushed by us. I call on all workers to turn their resentment into strength, step up production, complete the production tasks for 1950 ahead of schedule, and support the army in quickly liberating our territory of Taiwan!

\tOld worker Zhang Shunqing, who is over sixty years old, said angrily: This atrocity of American imperialism makes the people of the world feel resentful. They have offended the public and are simply inviting their own destruction. Let us unite to produce in large quantities. Producing one more screw is like making one more bullet, and we will use it to support the army in crushing American armed aggression and liberating Taiwan as soon as possible!

\tComrade Xu Qinghai said: This action of American imperialism is a desperate struggle, digging its own grave. We have overcome countless difficulties in the past. Now we have a strong people's army, navy, and air force. Crushing the conspiracies of American imperialism and liberating Taiwan is not a problem!

\tLabor Hero Li Rongjiu said: We Chinese people have stood up. We are definitely not afraid of the intimidation of American imperialism. We resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement. Liberating Taiwan is our responsibility. Railway workers will support the army with practical actions of improving transportation efficiency, eliminating accidents, and improving locomotive quality to liberate Taiwan!

\tComrade Wang Chengtian said: American imperialism is a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. Our working class has great strength. Whoever tries to stop us from moving forward, we will surely make them perish!

　　哈尔滨机务段工人们对杜鲁门无耻声明的抗议
    特等劳动英雄姚志平说：我们正展开保卫世界和平签名运动，美国帝国主义竟公然发表挑战声明，要武装干涉朝鲜内战，公开侵略我国的台湾，并且无耻地说“台湾问题待联合国考虑”。这种穷凶恶极的行为，正充分暴露帝国主义侵略的真面目。台湾是中国人民的领土，怎么样也不会变的；周外长的声明，正是代表中国人民的意志，我们是坚决拥护的。中国人民有多年的革命斗争锻炼，有高度的觉悟。毛主席领导我们已经打败了日本帝国主义和美国武装的蒋介石；并且我们的背后，有世界和平民主阵营的伟大力量，任何帝国主义的侵略行动都会被我们粉碎。我号召工人弟兄们把愤恨变成力量，加紧生产，提前完成一九五○年的生产任务，支援大军迅速解放我们的领土台湾！
    六十多岁的老工友张顺清气愤的说：美国帝国主义这一暴行，使全世界的人民都感到愤恨。他们触犯了众怒，就是自找灭亡。大家团结起来大量生产，多生产一个螺丝就等于多造一粒子弹，用它来支援大军粉碎美国武装侵略，早日解放台湾！
    徐清海工友说：美国帝国主义这一行动是他垂死挣扎，自挖坟墓。我们过去曾经战胜无数困难，现在我们有了强大的人民陆海空军，粉碎美帝国主义阴谋、解放台湾是不成问题的！
    劳动英雄李荣久说：我们中国人民已经站起来了。我们决不怕美帝国主义的恐吓。我们坚决拥护周外长的声明。解放台湾是我们的责任。铁路工人们会以提高运输效率、消灭事故、提高机车质量的实际行动支援大军，解放台湾！
    王承田工友说：美国帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎。我们工人阶级有伟大的力量，谁要阻挡我们前进，我们就一定叫他灭亡！
