Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: The American aggressors, mired deeper and deeper in the Korean quagmire, have been trying to coerce their puppet states to shoulder more responsibility for the war of aggression, but this attempt has encountered increasing difficulties. As of the 3rd, among the 41 countries that have expressed their willingness to act as accomplices to the US aggression in Korea (including the member states of the British Commonwealth participating in the United Nations, 21 Latin American countries, and the various vassal states of the US in Western Europe, North America, and Asia), apart from five countries, namely Britain, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, who have decided to directly participate in the US aggression and act as active accomplices, the remaining countries have expressed only general "support" or other "assistance" "other than military." The French government announced on the 7th that "France, in view of its struggle in Indochina, is unable to provide any military assistance to Korea."

But even active accomplices such as Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands are now, due to a lack of confidence in the war adventure, coupled with their own heavy difficulties, openly stating that they cannot send ground troops to participate in the war in Korea, except for sending a portion of their naval and air forces. A British Ministry of Defense official believes that "it is unlikely that Britain will supply ground forces to the United Nations to fight the North Korean communists." "Officials cited the statement made by Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Slim in Singapore on Monday (the 3rd): It is impossible to withdraw British troops from the Malayan war to supply Korea" (United Press, London, 4th). Regarding the issue of Australian army participation in the war, a spokesman for the British Commonwealth "occupation forces" stated on the 2nd: "The news that Australian army units will participate in the South Korean war is completely untrue. Australia does not currently have many infantrymen here, not enough to engage in this kind of combat." Dutch Prime Minister Drees told the Lower House on June 30th that "the troops dispatched by the Netherlands can only be symbolic and not practical." Even the US puppet Philippine government has expressed less than complete obedience on the issue of sending troops. The Philippine National Military Committee opposed sending Philippine troops abroad on the 3rd unless the United States equips them.

As for governments such as India, Indian representative to the Security Council, Rau, stated on the 3rd: "India should not send troops, warships, and airplanes to fight abroad, because India only has enough troops for its own self-defense." The member states of the Arab League (including Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen, etc.) have decided to adopt a non-interference attitude towards the Korean incident.

The American war-makers, who are accustomed to driving the soldiers of their puppet states to the front lines to fight for the interests of Wall Street, now have no choice but to drive their own soldiers to the very front lines.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Although the American armed interventionists seem to be aggressively mobilizing their land, sea, and air forces to invade Korea, dispatches from Washington reveal that some American officials, whose heads are not so feverish, have realized that the United States is mired in the Korean swamp. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 3rd, "The optimism of diplomats is somewhat affected by those discouraging factors." One of these factors is: "The United States has to pour its blood and wealth into this distant land to fight the Koreans, which has little value other than propaganda value. This weakening of American power must be regarded as a victory for the Soviet Union, at least on the material front." The dispatch also stated that these diplomats "fear that after the Western military force is over-concentrated around Korea," the imperialist aggressive forces in other regions will be weakened. British newspapers are more low-key in this regard than Washington's "diplomats." The London Daily Graphic wrote: The prolongation of the local war in Korea "will tie up a considerable portion of Western resources, especially consuming American strength" (British Information Service, London, 2nd). The Financial Times is even more worried about the United States. The newspaper's editorial said: "American economists have a bit of regret. They have begun to consider what economic consequences a long-term and costly war in the questionable environment of Korea will have." The newspaper said: The increase in war preparation costs directly increases the burden of inflation, which is not only the case in the United States, but also affects the rest of the world. The newspaper further said: "The United States is still not well enough equipped to launch a truly large-scale war. South Korea itself has no primary strategic importance and is a difficult place to defend." (Reuters, London, 5th)

### 美在朝鲜泥足愈陷愈深  仆从国家本身困难重重对侵略战争无信心  华盛顿“外交家”已为美国侵略前途担忧

　　美在朝鲜泥足愈陷愈深
    仆从国家本身困难重重对侵略战争无信心
    华盛顿“外交家”已为美国侵略前途担忧
    【新华社九日讯】深陷在朝鲜泥沼里的美国侵略者，虽然多方胁迫各仆从国家更多地分担侵略战争的责任，但这种企图已遭到愈来愈多的困难。截至三日止，已表示甘充美国侵略朝鲜帮凶的四十一国（包括不列颠联邦参加联合国的各成员国、拉丁美洲二十一国、及美国在西欧、北美和亚洲的各附庸国）中，除英、澳、加、荷、新西兰等五国决定直接参加美国的侵略作战，积极帮凶外，其余各国则表示仅限于一般的“支持”或“军事以外”的其它“援助”。法国政府已于七日宣布“法国鉴于自己在印度支那所进行的斗争，无力给朝鲜任何军事援助。”
    但就是英、澳、荷等积极帮凶者，现在也因为对战争冒险缺乏信心，加上本身的重重困难，除派出一部分海空军外，已公开表示不能派陆军去朝鲜参战。英国防部官员认为“英国不大可能把地面部队供给联合国，用来对北朝鲜共产党作战”。“官员引述帝国参谋总长史陵元帅星期一（三日）去新加坡所作的声明称：在马来亚战争中不可能抽调出英国军队来供给朝鲜”（合众社伦敦四日电）。对于澳陆军参战问题，不列颠联邦“占领军”发言人二日声明称：“传澳大利亚陆军部队将参与南朝鲜战事的消息完全不确。澳大利亚目前在这里的步兵不多，不够从事这种战斗。”荷总理德里斯六月三十日告下院称“荷所出兵力只能是象征性的而不能是实际的。”甚至美国的傀儡菲律宾政府也在派遣军队问题上表示了不十分恭顺。菲律宾全国军事委员会三日反对派遣菲军出国，除非由美国予以装备。
    至于印度等国政府，印度驻安理会代表劳氏三日表示：“印度不宜于派遣军队、军舰与飞机到国外作战，因为印度仅具有足够其本身自卫的部队。”阿拉伯联盟各成员国（包括埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、也门等），已决定对朝鲜事件采取不干涉态度。
    惯于把仆从国士兵赶上前线为华尔街的利益作战的美国战争制造者，现在只好把他们自己的士兵赶到最前线了。
    【新华社五日讯】尽管美国武装干涉者似乎是气势汹汹地调动它的陆海空军侵入朝鲜，但是来自华盛顿的电讯透露了有些头脑不是那样热昏的美国官员已发觉美国的泥足已陷在朝鲜的沼地中了。据合众社华盛顿三日电称：“外交家们的乐观情调多少受到那些使人沮丧的因素的影响”。这些因素之一就是：“美国要倾注它的鲜血与财富于这个辽远的土地之上和朝鲜人作战，而这事除了宣传价值之外并无多大价值。美国力量的这样削弱是必须算作是苏联的胜利的，起码在物质战线上是如此。”该电讯又称：这些外交家们“害怕在西方军力过分地集中在朝鲜周围之后”，帝国主义在其他地区的侵略势力就削弱了。英国的报纸在这方面比华盛顿的“外交家”更低调。伦敦每日写真报写道：朝鲜的地方性的战争之延长“将牵制相当大的一部分西方资源，尤其会消耗美国的实力”（英国新闻处伦敦二日电）。金融时报更为美国担忧。该报社论说：“美国的经济学家们有一点儿后悔了，他们已开始考虑到在朝鲜的可怀疑的环境中进行长期而耗费的战争，到底会发生怎样的经济后果。”该报说：战争准备耗费的增加，直接地加重了通货膨胀的负担，这不仅在美国是如此，即全世界的其他地方也要受同样的影响。该报更进一步说：“美国要发动真正大规模的战争，其装备还是很不够的。南朝鲜本身并无首要的战略重要性，而且又是很难防守的地方。”（路透社伦敦五日电）
