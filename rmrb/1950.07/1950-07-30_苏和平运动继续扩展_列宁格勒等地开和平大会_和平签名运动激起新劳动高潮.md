　　Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Comprehensive reports from TASS: The Soviet Union's movement to defend peace is continuing to expand.

　　Leningrad held a city-wide conference of intellectuals to defend peace on the 26th, with nearly two thousand people from the science, culture, and arts fields participating. A conference of cultural workers to defend peace was held in Vladivostok with 1,500 participants.

　　The famous historian, Academician Tarle, published an open letter to foreign scientists in the Pravda on the 27th, saying: The American imperialists' "total diplomacy" is leading to total war, leading to the mass slaughter of people with "total" weapons. Five years after the crematoria of Hitler were extinguished with the blood of Russians and other peoples, we cannot allow tens of thousands of people to be thrown into new crematoria caused by atomic explosions. We scientists should fight for peace.

　　The peace signature campaign has sparked a new wave of labor enthusiasm. In the "Peace Work Teams," millions of Soviet laborers are working in the Stakhanovite manner. The Stalin Mine in Prokopyevsk, one of the largest mines in Kuzbass, on July 14th, shipped out its sixty-sixth train, carrying coal produced by all the miners in excess of the 1950 plan. Metallurgical workers at a factory in Kazakhstan had already fulfilled their seven-month plan for steel and rolled metal production by the 15th. Workers in Estonian factories have exceeded their labor quotas by more than two and a half times. Miners of the Lenin Coal Trust had already overproduced by hundreds of tons of coal by the 25th.

　　These days, Soviet collective farmers are also working in the Stakhanovite style, striving to complete the grain harvest ahead of schedule and fulfill the plan for paying grain to the state in advance. Along the roads of the Don, Kuban, and Ukraine, trucks loaded with newly harvested grain are affixed with slogans such as: "Dedicate high-quality grain to the state" and "Support peace, oppose new war instigators."

　　苏和平运动继续扩展
    列宁格勒等地开和平大会     
    和平签名运动激起新劳动高潮
    【新华社二十九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联的保卫和平运动，正继续扩展中。
    列宁格勒于二十六日举行了全市的知识分子保卫和平大会，参加者有科学、文化与艺术界人士近二千人。在海参崴举行了一千五百人参加的文化工作者保卫和平大会。
    著名历史学家、科学院院士塔尔列，在二十七日的真理报上发表给外国科学家的公开信，他说：美帝国主义者的“总体外交”正引向总体战争，引向以“总体”武器去大批屠杀人民。在俄罗斯人和其他人民的血消灭了希特勒的焚尸炉五年后的今天，我们不能让成千累万的人民被投进由原子爆炸造成的新焚尸炉之中。我们科学家们，应当为和平而斗争。
    和平签名运动已激起了新的劳动热潮。在“和平工作班”内，千百万的苏联劳动人民以斯塔哈诺夫方式工作着。库兹巴斯的最大的矿坑之一、普洛柯庇夫斯克的斯大林矿坑，在七月十四日开出第六十六次列车，装运全体矿工超过一九五○年计划所生产的煤炭。哈萨克工厂的冶金工人，在十五日已提早实现钢和辗金属生产的七个月计划。爱沙尼亚各工厂的工人们，劳动定额已超过了两倍半。列宁采煤托拉斯的矿工二十五日已超计划生产了数百吨煤。
    这些天来，苏联集体农民也以斯塔哈诺夫式的工作，努力提早完成谷物的收割，提前履行向国家缴纳公粮的计划。沿着顿河、库班和乌克兰一带的公路，装着新收割的粮食的货车，都贴着这样的标语：“把上等谷物献给国家”“拥护和平，反对新战争煽动者”。
