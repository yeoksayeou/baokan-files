Editor's Note: The following two reports from Pyongyang expose the crimes of American aggressors who used air and naval forces to massacre peaceful Korean residents. The American aggressors, repeatedly defeated by the Korean People's Army, have become enraged and are recklessly bombing the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea with planes and artillery. This is a sign of the weakness of American imperialism and a shameless act of desperation in its difficult situation.

　　The Fury of Residents on Yangjiao Island

　　American bandits dropped a large number of bombs on Yangjiao Island in Pyongyang.

　　Because of this barbaric atrocity, many peaceful fields and homes were destroyed, and many lovely children, mothers, and elderly people lost their lives.

　　Yangjiao Island is located downstream of the Datong River. It is a quiet and beautiful island where residents love their peaceful homeland.

　　People planted willow trees around the island to protect against floods; poplar forests were cultivated on the wide land, where people lived comfortably.

　　Yangjiao Island has no military facilities – it is a peaceful island. The American army carried out a cruel bombing raid on this island.

　　On July 5th, the islanders were picking persimmons in the fields and digging early potatoes, while others were busy preparing to sow autumn cabbage and radishes.

　　Children were naked, catching small fish in the river. This is a picture that all good people would dream of.

　　The bombs randomly dropped on this island by the bandits took countless precious lives and destroyed countless houses.

　　We will never forget the barbaric atrocities committed by the murderous bandit American imperialism against such a beautiful island.

　　On this day, Zhao Yimu's wife, Han Yuanfu, from Yangjiao Village, was killed by enemy bombs, leaving behind three children.

　　When this woman died, "Jingshun," who was only three months old, was still sucking on her nipple. The dead Han Yuanfu held the young life tightly in her arms.

　　How can we let go of the enemy who took away the precious maternal love and the milk in his mouth from the young life?

　　The young lives crawled on the corpse, crying, "Mommy, Mommy!"

　　Her six-year-old son, Jingxin, and four-year-old son, Longyun, initially stared blankly around, and then burst into tears. We will never forget this tragic scene.

　　These young eyes will one day recognize the enemy.

　　A bomb also fell on the field of the old man Jin Shoude in Yangjiao Village.

　　Because of this bomb, the old woman Jin Shengyi, wife of the farmer Xian Yuyi who lived at No. 29 Yangjiao Village, was also killed.

　　But we are not sad. "Life" must be repaid with "life"; "blood" must be repaid with "blood." Her sons Xian Yinglong and Xian Longkui have bravely joined the army and set out to fight the enemy. Only in this way can the enemies be made to remember forever.

　　On this day, Hong Chunhuan, the son of Hong Fengzhi from Yangjiao Village, a student at Pyongyang No. 17 Elementary School, was also killed by enemy bombs while running along the riverbank to avoid enemy planes.

　　The student's body could not be found. Only five small fingers stained with red wildflowers were discovered.

　　The enemies do not care about fields or houses, they throw bombs everywhere. More or less, the houses of more than 150 households on Yangjiao Island were damaged. Even the sheds in the fields were destroyed. The sheds of Yin Junming and Zheng Derun were bombed. The fields of Jin Shoude and many other farmers were almost completely destroyed.

　　However, we can still see the tenacious life force of the farmers who are busy preparing to sow autumn crops in the burned fields. Farmer Jin Shoude has filled in the bomb craters and cultivated well-ordered ridges.

　　Zhang Shixian is already selecting good persimmons in his persimmon field, preparing to pay the tax in kind (i.e., public grain).

　　The enemy's wanton bombing of Yangjiao Island has doubled the people's resentment, and this power is invincible. People will go directly to battle, and the bandits will not gain any advantage!

　　Now, the young people of Yangjiao Island are volunteering to join the war to kill the enemy. Zhang Shixian is even more excited, and his only son has volunteered to join the war and has already left for the front line.

　　The people are gathering all their strength and heading to the front line to defeat the various atrocities and crimes of the American bandits. The mobilized situation is the new face of Yangjiao Island after the bombing.

　　"A Hundred Towns Destroyed, We Will Rebuild a Thousand!"

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　— Oath of the People of Jumunjin

　　American imperialism, which is madly trying to turn Korea into its colony, continues its barbaric bombing of Korean territory.

　　The US imperialists bombed Wonsan, Yangyang, Goseong, Gangneung, and other places, destroying many houses and massacring many people. From July 2nd, they also carried out extremely cruel shelling of Jumunjin with warships.

　　The continuous shelling for five consecutive days destroyed more than one-third of the houses and main buildings in Jumunjin, and many women, children, and elderly people were massacred.

　　For five years, the citizens of Jumunjin, who had suffered under the cruel police system of American imperialism and the traitor Syngman Rhee, were celebrating their liberation by the heroic People's Army and becoming happy citizens of the Republic, working hard to build their own peaceful and happy lives. On July 5th, the US imperialists dispatched all the ships they could mobilize to the east coast and began shelling them.

　　This bestial shelling not only massacred many innocent citizens but also destroyed port facilities and more than forty fishing boats.

　　Choi Sam-soo, a fisherman whose house was destroyed and whose only means of livelihood was taken away by the beasts' shelling, said with great anger and hatred:

　　"In an attempt to save the collapse of the Syngman Rhee gang, the US imperialists mobilized the navy, army, and air force to directly engage in armed intervention, and blindly bombarded our peaceful towns and villages. This barbaric behavior will never be forgotten not only by our generation but also by our children and grandchildren. Therefore, I have a clearer understanding that the American imperialists, who have always oppressed the Korean people and obstructed the unification and independence of our country, are our mortal enemies.

　　"The beasts continue to shell - barbarically shelling our peaceful towns and villages, only increasing our hatred and unity. A hundred towns are destroyed, we will rebuild a thousand; forty fishing boats are destroyed, we will build four hundred. I vow to dedicate all my strength to win the victory of the whole nation."

　　More than a dozen people who were listening to Choi Sam-soo's speech all expressed their determination with anger: Under the banner of the Republic, under the leadership of their own People's Committee, they will bravely move forward.

### 美国侵略者在朝鲜的可耻罪行

专栏：

　　美国侵略者在朝鲜的可耻罪行
    编者按：下面两篇来自平壤的报道，暴露了美国侵略者使用空海军屠杀朝鲜和平居民的罪行。美国侵略者被朝鲜人民军打得一败再败，便老羞成怒，向南北朝鲜非军事地带以飞机大炮狂肆轰炸。这正是美国帝国主义脆弱的表示，是它在狼狈不堪的情况下要出的无耻手段。
    羊角岛居民的怒火
    美国强盗们在平壤羊角岛扔下了大量炸弹。
    由于这种野蛮的暴行，和平的田园和民房多被炸毁，还有很多可爱的孩子、母亲、老者们，也丧失了性命。
    羊角岛在大同江的下流，这是一个安静的美丽的岛屿，岛上居民热爱着这个和平的自己的土地。
    人们在岛的周围，种上了柳树，来防备洪水的侵袭；杨树林栽培在那宽阔的土地上，人们很安适的居住着。
    羊角岛没有任何军事设施——是一个和平的岛屿。美军竟对这个岛实行了残忍的轰炸。
    七月五日，这天，岛民们正在田园里摘取洋柿子，掘取早熟的马铃薯，还有些人在忙着准备播种秋白菜和萝卜。
    小孩子们光着身子，在河里捕捉着小鱼。这是所有善良的人们所理想的一幅画面。
    乱投在这岛上的强盗们的炸弹，夺去了无数宝贵的生命，破坏了无数的房舍。
    杀人强盗美国帝国主义，对这样美丽的小岛所施行的野蛮暴行，我们是永远不会忘掉的。
    这一天，羊角村赵伊穆（译音）的妻子韩媛福（译音）竟被敌弹炸死，留下三个小孩。
    这位妇女死去的时候，年仅三个月的“景顺”（译音）还在衔着乳头。死去的韩媛福，把那幼小的生命紧抱在怀里。
    夺去了幼小生命的珍贵的母性爱和他口中的乳头的仇敌，我们怎能够放过它？
    幼小的生命们爬在这个尸体上，“妈呀，妈呀！”的叫喊着，啼哭着。
    她的六岁的儿子景心（译音）和四岁的儿子龙云（译音），起初，瞪着眼睛，凝视着四周，后来就放声大哭。这种悲惨的情景，我们决不会忘掉？
    这些幼小的眼珠，一定会有一天，认清敌人。
    羊角村的金寿德（译音）老人的田地，也落了一颗炸弹。
    由于这颗炸弹，住在羊角村二九号的农民咸裕逸（译音）的老婆金圣逸（译音）老妇也被炸死了。
    可是，我们决不悲伤。“命”，要用“命”来填还；“血”，要用“血”来偿。她的儿子咸应龙（译音）和咸龙奎（译音）弟兄两个，已奋勇参军，出征杀敌。只有这样才可以使敌人们永远牢记。
    这一天，躲着敌机，在江边奔跑的小孩群中，有平壤第十七小学的学生——羊角村洪凤植（译音）的儿子洪淳焕（译音），也被敌弹炸死。
    这个学生的尸首，无法找到。只发现了五个小指头染红野花。
    敌人们并不管田园或房屋，同样的到处投掷炸弹。羊角岛一百五十余户的房舍，或多或少的都被毁伤。甚至，把田地里的窝棚也给炸毁。尹俊明（译音）和郑德润（译音）的窝棚都被炸了。金寿德等许多农户的田园，几乎被炸光了。
    可是，我们现在还看得见在被焚毁了的田园里，忙着准备播种秋谷的农民们的坚韧的生活力量。农民金寿德已经把轰炸的土坑填平，耕好了井然的田垅。
    张士显（译音）已在他的洋柿子地里，挑选着好的柿子，准备交现物税（即公粮）。
    敌人们对于羊角岛的肆行轰炸，使人们的愤恨倍加，这个力量是无敌的。人们将直接走向战斗，强盗们决占不了任何便宜！
    现在，羊角岛的青年们，连日志愿参战杀敌。张士显更兴奋，他唯一的儿子志愿参战，已经出发到前线去了。
    人民正汇集了总的力量，为了打败美国强盗们各种的暴行与罪恶，奔向前线。动员起来的情况，就是被炸后的羊角岛的新面目。

    “一百个城镇被毁，我们要重建一千个！”
    ——注文津人民的誓语
    疯狂的想把朝鲜变为其殖民地的美国帝国主义，对朝鲜领土的野蛮轰击，仍在继续着。
    美帝国主义者轰击了元山、襄阳、干城、江陵等地，毁坏了许多民房，屠杀了许多人民。由七月二日起，又以战舰对注文津实行了极其残忍的炮轰。
    连续五天之久的不断轰击，竟摧毁了注文津三分之一以上的房舍和主要建筑，许许多多的妇孺老弱竟被屠杀。
    五年来，在美帝国主义和李承晚叛徒残酷的警察制度下，受尽苦难的注文津市民，正庆幸被英勇人民军所解放，成为幸福的共和国公民，为了建设自己的和平幸福的生活而努力。美帝竟在七月五日，调派可能动员到东海岸来的所有船舰，对他们开始了轰击。
    这种野兽们的炮轰，不但屠杀了很多无辜的市民，且把港湾设备和四十多艘渔船也予摧毁。
    由于野兽们的炮击，房屋被毁，唯一谋生手段被夺去的渔民崔三洙（译音）以极大愤怒与仇恶的心情说道：
    “美帝国主义者为了企图挽救李承晚匪帮的败溃，动员了海陆空军，直接进行武装干涉，对于我们和平市镇和农村，竟盲目的滥行轰击。这种野蛮行为，不但是我们这一代，就是我们子孙万代也永不会忘掉的。因此我更明确地认识，一向压迫朝鲜人民，百般阻挠我们祖国统一、独立的美帝国主义者，才是我们的死对头。
    “野兽们继续炮击——野蛮的炮击我们的和平市镇和农村，只有更增加我们敌忾同仇的心情，一百个城镇被毁，我们将要重建一千个；四十艘渔船被破坏，我们要建造四百艘。我发誓愿献出我所有的力量以争取全民的胜利。”
    围绕着崔三洙倾听他谈话的十多名群众，也都愤然表示决心：在共和国的旗帜下，在他们自己的人民委员会的领导下，勇往迈进。
