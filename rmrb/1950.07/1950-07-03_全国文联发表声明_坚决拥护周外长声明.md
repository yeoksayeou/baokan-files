Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles today issued a statement regarding Truman's provocative statement on the 27th, stating: We, representing the nation's literary and art workers, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of June 28th. We believe that this statement will receive the warm support of peace-loving people around the world. Truman's sinister attempt to directly interfere in China's internal affairs with armed force and to undermine peace in the Far East will certainly be crushed under the resolute resistance of the Chinese people and the people of Asia. This is a paper tiger of a warmonger digging his own grave! The united strength of the Chinese people and the people of Asia, the united strength of peace-loving people around the world, is a thousand times greater than the strength of the warmongers. Final victory belongs to us.

    坚决拥护周外长声明
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会今日就杜鲁门二十七日挑衅声明发表声明称：我们代表全国的文学艺术工作者，坚决拥护周恩来外长六月二十八日的严正声明。我们相信：这个声明将得到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。杜鲁门直接以武力干涉中国内政破坏远东和平的罪恶企图，在中国人民以及亚洲人民的坚决反抗下，是一定要被粉碎的。这是外强中干的战争贩子在自掘坟墓！中国人民以及亚洲人民团结起来的力量，全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来的力量，大过战争贩子们的力量千百倍，最后胜利是属于我们的。
