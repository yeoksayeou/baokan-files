　　Henan Huangchuan Primary School Education Work Suffers Deviations
    Some Cadres Relax Leadership of Education Work
    Chaotic Phenomena of Blindly Restoring Development and Mass Layoffs Occurred in Guangshan and Other Counties

    [By this newspaper] The Huangchuan Special District of Henan Province has achieved considerable success in restoring and consolidating primary school education. However, due to the negligence and relaxation of leadership over education work by some local leading cadres, serious deviations and shortcomings have occurred in some areas, violating the policy of restoring and transforming education in a planned and step-by-step manner and striving to unite and transform intellectuals, creating great difficulties for future restoration and development of primary school education.

    The restoration of primary school education in Huangchuan Special District has been successful. When the entire district was liberated last spring, more than 90 percent of the 1,072 primary schools in the entire district were forced to close due to the Kuomintang bandit army's frantic destruction in the Dabie Mountains before its demise. The People's Government actively restored schools, transformed teachers, and strived to enroll farmers' children in accordance with the policy of "maintaining existing schools, focusing on restoring closed schools, and gradually transforming them." In the past year or so, 514 complete primary schools and junior primary schools have been restored. There are now 54,221 students, which is close to the number of students before 1947 (more than 57,000). In rural primary schools throughout the district, children of poor, lower-middle peasants now account for more than 60 percent. Last summer and winter vacations, special districts and counties held training courses for primary school teachers. Of the existing 1,700 primary school teachers, more than 95 percent have participated in political studies and have undergone preliminary ideological transformation. Improvements have generally been made in teaching content and methods. Primary schools and primary school teachers in various places can also cooperate with the central work of the government and social reform movements to publicize the policies and laws of the Communist Party and the People's Government to the masses and expose rumors. Many schools also carried out "labor to build schools" during the restoration process, saving the state a portion of its expenses; some schools also launched "production to assist education," leading students to reclaim wasteland, grow vegetables, chop firewood, and accumulate manure in their spare time in order to strive for the enrollment of children from poor families. In disaster areas, some schools organized students to persist in teaching by methods such as half-day classes and half-day production.

    While achieving the above-mentioned achievements, the deviations and shortcomings in the work are also serious. Some local cadres are not good at comprehensively promoting work, but instead carry out central work in a single-handed manner, neglecting and relaxing leadership over education work. Some counties lack thorough plans for restoring and consolidating school work, and the steps are chaotic. For example, Guangshan and other counties initially did not study the instructions from higher authorities to "focus on restoration" and did not consider the local financial situation, resulting in a general restoration of schools and blind development. After development, they did not pay attention to inspection work, nor did they pay attention to ideological leadership of teachers, resulting in phenomena such as some schools arbitrarily opening classes, falsely reporting numbers, principals embezzling, and teachers becoming corrupt, and even colluding with landlords to resist mass movements. This spring, due to local financial difficulties, these blindly developed schools needed to be rectified and appropriately streamlined and merged. The education sections of Guangshan and Gushi counties did not study the instructions from higher authorities and proceed prudently in a step-by-step manner, but instead arbitrarily cancelled and merged primary schools and massively laid off teachers in a simple manner, and did not responsibly make appropriate arrangements for the laid-off teachers. Guangshan had 627 teachers in the previous period, and this period laid off 350 teachers after merging schools and classes three times, of which only 100 were placed in jobs or study. Gushi laid off 188 of the 285 teachers, and less than one-fifth of the laid-off teachers were responsibly placed. In the past, the special district education section did not conduct in-depth inspection work, and did not promptly correct the deviations of blind development and mass layoffs before and after. As a result of the mass layoffs, the number of children enrolled in Guangshan County decreased by more than one-third compared to the previous period; Gushi County decreased by more than three-fifths. The unemployment of teachers and the increase in out-of-school children have caused dissatisfaction among the masses, creating great difficulties for future restoration and development of primary school work.

    Secondly, some educational administrative cadres have bureaucratic and commandist styles. They do not respect the work of primary school teachers, lead them to carry out ideological transformation, and help them progress politically; instead, they feel that they are "in charge of them" and that "cadres are one level higher than teachers." When cadres of the Huangchuan County Education Section ran teacher training courses, they said: "This time we will rectify them." Xixian cadres do not go to schools to inspect work at ordinary times, and arbitrarily remove and reduce salaries, which not only prevents teachers from recognizing their shortcomings and mistakes, but also creates factionalism and mutual exclusion. Some counties do not care about the lives of teachers: Xixian inappropriately emphasizes that teachers should not only care about personal interests, and calls for donations. One-third of the half-year salary and food of the teachers of Wulongji Complete Primary School was deducted for purchasing public bonds and saving money. Luoshan County allocated the outstanding arrears of public grain collection to schools as funds, making teachers busy collecting the outstanding arrears of grain, which hindered teaching and made it impossible to maintain their lives.

    In addition, some district and township cadres have wrong ideas and do not adopt the correct policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, but discriminate against and exclude them. They lack encouragement for teachers who have achieved success in their work. For teachers with shortcomings and poorly run schools, they do not give correct criticism and education to help them improve their work and mobilize farmers' children to enroll, but only stand aside and criticize. Some district cadres in Huangchuan said: "Supporting teachers is supporting landlords and rich peasants. What's the use of taking care of them!" In addition, some cadres expressed dissatisfaction with the salary system of teachers, believing that they "have been revolutionizing for several years and are still on the supply system. Why should teachers get more than 100 catties of rice a month?" These wrong ideas and actions have made some teachers feel downhearted, unwilling to work, and created a gap between cadres and teachers. When the special district education section inspected work in Xixian County, several teachers said: "We have not spoken so much to government cadres in more than a year since liberation." These shortcomings are currently being corrected in all aspects.

　　河南潢川小学教育工作发生偏向
    部分干部放松教育工作的领导
    光山等县发生盲目恢复发展及大量裁员的混乱现象
    【本报讯】河南省潢川专区在恢复、整顿小学教育工作中得到了相当的成绩，但由于某些地方领导干部忽视和放松了对教育工作的领导，部分地区产生了严重的偏向和缺点，违反了有计划有步骤地恢复改造教育事业和争取团结改造知识分子的方针，造成今后恢复发展小学教育工作上的很大困难。
    潢川专区恢复小学教育是有成绩的。去年春全区解放时，因为国民党匪军覆灭前在大别山区的疯狂破坏，全专区一千零七十二所小学，百分之九十以上被迫停办。人民政府根据“维持现有学校，重点恢复已停办的学校，逐步改造”的方针，积极恢复学校，改造教师，争取农民子女入学。一年多来已恢复完小和初小五百一十四校。现有学生达五万四千二百二十一人，已接近一九四七年前学生人数（五万七千余人）。全区农村小学的学生中，贫雇中农子女已占百分之六十以上。去年暑假和寒假，专署和各县都举办了小学教师讲习会。现有的一千七百余名小学教师中，百分之九十五以上参加了政治学习，初步进行了思想改造，在教学内容和教育方法上一般都有改进。各地小学和小学教员，并能配合政府的中心工作和社会改革运动，向群众宣传共产党与人民政府的政策法令，揭破谣言。不少学校在复校中并利用课余进行了“劳动建校”，节省了国家一部分开支；有的学校还发动了“生产助学”，领导学生在课余开荒、种菜、打柴、积粪，以争取贫苦家庭的子女入学。在灾区，有的学校组织学生以半日上课、半日生产等方法，坚持了教学。
    在获得上述成绩的同时，工作中的偏向与缺点也是严重的。某些地方干部不善于全面推动工作，而是单打一地进行中心工作，忽视和放松了对教育工作的领导。某些县在恢复整顿学校工作上没有周密的计划，步骤混乱。如光山等县起初不研究上级“重点恢复”指示，不考虑地方财政情况，形成普遍恢复学校，盲目发展。发展起来后又不注意检查工作，不注意对教员的思想领导，造成某些学校滥开班次，虚报人数，校长贪污，教员腐化的现象，甚至还有勾结地主，抵抗群众运动的。今春因为地方财政困难，这些盲目发展起来的学校需要加以整顿，适当地精简并班。光山、固始两县教育科又不研究上级的指示，有步骤地谨慎地进行，而以简单的方式，任意取消、合并小学，大量裁减教员，对被裁教员也未尽责地作适当的处理。光山上期有教员六百二十七人，本期三次并校并班，裁去三百五十人，其中安置了工作和学习的只一百人。固始将二百八十五名教员裁去一百八十八人，负责安置了的不到被裁人数的五分之一。专署教育科过去不深入检查工作，对前后盲目发展和大量裁员的偏向均未及时纠正。大量裁员的结果，光山县入学儿童比去年下期减少了三分之一强；固始县减少了五分之三以上。教员的失业和失学儿童的增加，使群众感到不满，造成今后恢复、发展小学工作上很大的困难。
    其次，在部分教育行政干部中，存在着官僚主义与命令主义作风。对待小学教员不是尊重他们的工作，领导他们进行思想改造，从政治上帮助他们进步；而是觉得自己是“管他们的”，认为“干部比教员高一级”。潢川县教育科干部在办教员讲习会时说：“这回可要整他们一家伙。”息县干部平时不到学校检查工作，随便撤换、减薪，使教员不仅不能认识自己的缺点和错误，还造成闹宗派、互相排挤的现象。有的县对教员的生活不关心：息县不适当地强调教员不要光顾个人利益，号召捐献，乌龙集完小教员半年的薪粮因购买公债、节约，被扣出了三分之一。罗山县把征收公粮的尾欠拨给学校作经费，使教员忙于催收尾欠粮。妨碍了教学，生活也维持不了。
    另外，某些区乡干部中存在错误思想，对地主、富农出身的知识分子不采取正确的团结改造的方针，而加以歧视和排斥。对工作中有成绩的教员缺少鼓励。对有缺点的教员与办理较差的学校，不加以正确的批评教育，帮助其改进工作并动员农民子女入学，只是站在一旁指摘。潢川有的区干部说：“养活教员就是养活地富，管他干啥！”此外，还有些干部对教员的薪金制待遇表示不满，认为自己“革命好几年了还是供给制，教员凭什么一个月拿一百多斤米。”这些错误的思想与行动，使部分教员情绪低落，不安心工作，并造成干部与教员之间的隔阂。专署教育科在息县检查工作时，有几个教员说：“解放一年多来，我们就没有跟政府的干部说过这么多话。”这些缺点，目前正在从各方面加以纠正中。
