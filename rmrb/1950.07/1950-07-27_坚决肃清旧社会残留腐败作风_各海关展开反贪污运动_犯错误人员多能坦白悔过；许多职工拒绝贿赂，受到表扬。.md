[Report from this newspaper] Various customs offices are now vigorously launching mass anti-corruption campaigns to eliminate the phenomenon of corruption left over from the long-term criminal rule of imperialism and reactionaries.

In old China, due to the insidious policies of enslavement and division adopted by imperialism, customs employees generally blindly followed imperialism ideologically and politically, and lived a corrupt and hedonistic life. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the atmosphere of corruption became even more serious and widespread. According to a statistic made by the Guangzhou Customs in May this year based on the self-reflection of all retained personnel, the number of people who were corrupt before liberation accounted for 92% of the total number of employees. Among the 167 people in Xiamen Customs, 101 admitted to being corrupt before liberation; among the 40 field staff in the customs, 39 were corrupt, and all 15 stationed in the inspection factories were corrupt.

After liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, customs personnel in various places underwent ideological reform. Through political study and various mass movements, most of them were able to criticize their past bad practices and understand that they had changed from their past position as tools of imperialism to masters of the new customs, thereby initially establishing the idea of serving the people.

However, on the other hand, there are still a few people who do not understand the policies of the People's Government and are unwilling to give up their past corrupt lives, and still secretly engage in corrupt acts that harm the interests of the people after liberation. These phenomena have been discovered one after another in customs offices across the country, and in individual customs offices, this phenomenon is still quite serious. The Guangzhou Customs launched an anti-corruption campaign in May. Among the more than 800 people in the customs, 160 have voluntarily confessed that they still committed corrupt acts after liberation. Some staff members of the Wusong Sub-Customs of the Shanghai Customs have been corrupting since liberation; Chen Yuliang even embezzled 1.96 million yuan of mutual aid and relief funds issued to the families of deceased colleagues.

These corrupt phenomena are absolutely not allowed to continue to exist in the People's Customs. In response to these situations, customs offices in various places have launched anti-corruption campaigns, adhering to the policy of combining education and punishment. Some personnel in the Guangzhou Customs who had engaged in corruption after liberation cried bitterly when confessing, and some even requested punishment, guaranteeing that they would never commit the crime again in the future. The Shanghai Customs Trade Union's publication "New Customs" and various wall newspapers have published articles against corruption. Under the call of the government's lenient policy and the supervision and assistance of the masses, more than 40 people who had committed corruption have confessed and repented bitterly.

Customs offices in various places have leniently dealt with those who have made mistakes but are able to confess and repent, giving them a chance to turn over a new leaf. However, those who insist on their mistakes and refuse to confess will be given legal sanctions according to the severity of their circumstances. For example, Huo Jinshui, a sailor of the Guangzhou Customs, was dismissed for stealing smuggled goods during the anti-corruption campaign. Dai Yisheng, Jin Xinmin, and Yang Wenhao of the Shanghai Customs, Ci Weixin of the Andong Customs, and Zhang Huantang of the Gongbei Customs have been dismissed and sent to the People's Court for trial because they committed serious acts of corruption and could not conduct in-depth self-criticism.

During the anti-corruption campaign in customs offices across the country, everyone unanimously expressed their deep hatred for corruption, and many employees responded to the anti-corruption campaign with practical actions. For example, Yao Xitian of the Andong Customs refused a bribe of 3 million yuan from unscrupulous merchants and tried to uncover the smuggled drugs (heroin). Chen Yukeng and Huang Lu of Shanghai, Liu Kewen, Gu Qingbo, and Li Baoqing of Guangzhou all demonstrated good behavior in refusing bribes at work and have been commended.

　　坚决肃清旧社会残留腐败作风
    各海关展开反贪污运动
    犯错误人员多能坦白悔过；许多职工拒绝贿赂，受到表扬。
    【本报讯】各地海关现正热烈展开群众性的反贪污运动，以肃清帝国主义和反动派长期罪恶统治所遗留下来的贪污现象。
    旧中国的海关，由于帝国主义采取奴化、分化的毒辣政策，造成了海关员工在思想上、政治上盲目追随帝国主义，在生活上腐化享乐的普遍现象。在国民党反动政府统治时期，贪污风气更加严重和普遍。广州海关今年五月根据全体留用人员自己的反省作了一项统计，该关在解放前贪污的人数占总人数百分之九十二。厦门海关一百六十七人中，自己承认在解放前贪污的有一百零一人；在该关四十个外勤职员中贪污的有三十九人，而驻验货厂的十五人竟个个贪污。
    各地解放后，海关人员在人民政府领导下，进行思想改造。通过政治学习及各种群众运动，大多数均能批判过去的坏作风，明白自己已由过去帝国主义的工具的地位转变为新海关的主人，因而初步地树立了为人民服务的思想。
    但在另一方面，也仍有少数人不了解人民政府的政策，不愿放弃过去的腐化生活，解放后仍偷偷摸摸做出危害人民利益的贪污行为。这些现象在各地海关已陆续发现，而且，个别海关这种现象还相当严重。广州海关于五月份展开反贪污运动，在该关八百余人中，已自动坦白在解放后仍犯有贪污行为的有一百六十人。上海海关吴淞分关部分职员解放后一直在贪污；陈禹良竟连发给死亡同人家属的互助救济金也贪污了一百九十六万元。
    这些贪污现象，在人民海关中是决不容许继续存在的。各关针对这些情况，本着教育与处分相结合的方针，纷纷展开反贪污运动。广州海关有些解放后曾经贪污的人员在坦白时痛哭流涕，有些并自请处分，保证以后决不再犯。上海海关工会刊物“新海关”及各壁报纷纷发表反贪污的文字。在政府宽大政策的感召和群众的监督帮助下，已有四十余个犯过贪污的人纷纷坦白，痛切悔过。
    各海关对于那些犯过错误但能坦白悔过的人都宽大处理，给以自新机会。但对那些坚持错误不肯坦白的分子，则按其情节轻重，分别予以法律制裁。如广州海关水手霍金水在反贪污运动中仍偷窃私货，已被撤职。上海海关的戴义生、金新民、杨文豪，安东海关的慈维新，拱北海关的张焕唐等因犯了严重的贪污行为且不能深刻检讨，都已撤职送人民法院讯办。
    在各地海关反贪污运动中，大家一致表示对贪污行为的深恶痛绝，许多职工并以实际行动来响应反贪污运动。如安东海关姚喜田拒绝奸商三百万元的贿赂并设法将其偷运的毒品（白面）破获。上海的陈玉铿、黄璐，广州的刘克文、谷清波、李葆清等在工作时都表现了拒绝贿赂的良好作风，都已得到了表扬。
