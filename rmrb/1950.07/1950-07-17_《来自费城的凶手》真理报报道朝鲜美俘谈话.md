Xinhua News Agency, 16th: TASS, Moscow, 15th: *Pravda* published a dispatch from Irina Volkova in Korea, entitled "The Murderer from Philadelphia." Volkova describes American soldiers and officers captured by the Korean People's Democratic Republic People's Army. She characterizes Donald Sellman, an American pilot who not long ago was bombing peaceful towns in North Korea, as follows:

When we were in Pyongyang, bombs fell on residential areas, and American pilots swooped down on the streets of peaceful Korean cities, strafing houses and buildings with machine guns. The "Flying Fortresses," escorted by fighter planes (one of which was flown by Sellman), continued their raids for hours. Sellman described in detail that the "B-29" aircraft took off from Japanese airfields, and not from the sea as reported by Tokyo. Sellman said that with such good airfields built by the Americans in advance nearby, taking off from the sea would be too silly. Indeed, there are only three airfields that can accommodate "B-29" aircraft, but we were assured: "We will soon finish off the Koreans, and these airfields will be sufficient…."

What does he—Sellman—personally think of all this that is happening? He hesitated for a moment and then said: In my opinion, the Koreans themselves can manage their own affairs very well. Truman has messed things up… We asked him: How could he, a famous pilot with ten years of flying experience, be captured? Sellman replied awkwardly: These Koreans, they fight like lions. On July 7th, I attacked a tank in a certain area and was shot down immediately. He added sullenly: I didn't expect this. We were always told that the Koreans could not match the Americans. I don't need world hegemony, he said gloomily. Let Truman have those dreams. I became a pilot because the pay was good, and now, the little house in Philadelphia is very good for me.

These few words completely portray him—the dejected aerial hero. He came to a foreign and peaceful land, soaking its towns and villages in blood. He strafed women and children with machine guns because he was immersed in the joy of a hunter chasing his prey. But once he was captured, he felt no shame or remorse. He felt happy because he was still alive.

There are all kinds of people in the army of the American imperialists. There are deceived people: farmers, clerks, workers. There are also other people—bought with money. Whether deceived or bought—in the end, they all prefer to be captured, just to stay alive. Let American mothers know: Their sons who set foot on Korean soil have only two fates: to die disgracefully or to be captured.

　　《来自费城的凶手》真理报报道朝鲜美俘谈话
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：真理报刊载伊林娜·伏尔科瓦发自朝鲜的电讯，题为《来自费城的凶手》。伏尔科瓦描写了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军俘获的美国兵士和军官，她将不久以前还在轰炸北朝鲜和平城镇的战俘之一的美国飞机驾驶员唐纳·塞尔曼的性格刻划如下：
    我们在平壤的时候，炸弹落在住宅区，美国飞行员向和平的朝鲜城市的街道俯冲下来，用机枪扫射房屋、建筑物。战斗机（其中一架是塞尔曼驾驶的）护送的“飞行堡垒”的空袭继续了数小时之久。塞尔曼详尽地叙述，“Ｂ——２９型”飞机是从日本机场起飞的，而不是如东京消息所称是从海上起飞的。塞尔曼说，近旁有美国事前建就的这样好的机场，从海上起飞未免太傻了。的确，可以容纳“Ｂ——２９型”飞机的机场只有三个，不过我们得到保证：“很快就会把朝鲜人结果了，这些机场是足够应用的……。”
    对于正在发生的这一切，他——塞尔曼——个人作何感想呢？他迟疑了一会，然后说：在我看来，朝鲜人自己能够很好的管理自己的事。杜鲁门把事情弄坏了………我们问他：他是一个有十年飞行经验的著名飞行员，怎么会被俘了呢？塞尔曼狼狈地回答：这些朝鲜人，他们打起仗来像狮子一样。七月七日我袭击某地区的坦克，立刻就给打下来了。他怏怏不乐地补充说：我没有料到这样，我们总是听说朝鲜人不能与美国人匹敌。我不需要世界霸权，他忧郁地说，让杜鲁门去做那些梦罢。我当驾驶员是因为待遇好，而现在，费城的小屋对我已是很好了。
    这几句话就把他——垂头丧气的空中英雄完全描绘出来。他走到外国的和平国土上来，把它的城镇和乡村浸沈在血泊之中。他用机枪扫射妇女和儿童，因为他沉于猎夫追逐其猎物的欢快，而一旦他被俘了，他毫不觉得羞耻与懊悔。他因为他仍然活着而觉得快乐。
    在美国帝国主义者的军队里有各色各样的人。那里有受骗的人：农民、小职员、工人。也有其他的人——用钱买来的。不论受骗的或买来的——最后都宁愿被俘，只求活命。让美国做母亲的知道：踏上朝鲜国土的她们的儿子只有两种命运：可耻地死去或者被俘。
