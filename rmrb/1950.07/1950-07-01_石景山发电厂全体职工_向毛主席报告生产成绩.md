To Respected Chairman Mao:

Since liberation, we have all been living happy lives free from oppression and exploitation. Therefore, we always want to see you and talk with you. We have many things we want to say to you. However, we know you are very busy with your work, so we wholeheartedly focus on production under the leadership of the Party, striving to improve the factory to live up to your expectations.

Since liberation, we have made many improvements in production. Especially in June, to welcome "July 1st," we signed a collective contract for the entire plant. In this month alone, we have had one hundred and fifty new records, rationalization proposals, and technological improvements.

Now, we are reporting to you a great joy. In order to welcome the Party's birthday on "July 1st," we have solved the problem of coal dust leakage. Our factory installed two pulverized coal furnaces in 1946. Since they started operating, the coal dust from the coal mills has leaked at least five tons per day. The leaking coal dust filled Shijingshan, and nearby residents inhaled and ate a lot of coal dust, which greatly affected their health. Many workers developed lung diseases. At the same time, coal dust is very harmful to machinery, electrical systems, insulators, and insulation. This has been our great enemy for several years and we have not been able to eliminate it. However, this year, under the call of the Party, everyone used their brains, and workers and engineers worked together to study and put forward many rationalization proposals. With the help of Soviet engineers, the problem of coal dust leakage was basically solved by June 20th. In addition, we also solved the quota for the proportion of steel balls in the coal mill. These improvements can save 1,143,400 jin of millet per year, which is equivalent to three months' wages for all our workers. The benefits to personal and machine safety that are invisible to the naked eye are immeasurable.

Now, our entire plant has been swept up in a production competition and is developing a high tide of rationalization proposals and creating new records. We have the confidence to improve the capital's power plant under the leadership of the Party and you. We wish you good health!

All workers of Shijingshan Power Plant
June 29th

　　石景山发电厂全体职工
    向毛主席报告生产成绩
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂全体职工上书毛主席报告为迎接“七一”在生产方面所得到的成绩，原文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    解放后我们就都过着再没人压迫剥削快快乐乐的好日子，所以我们老想看到你，和你在一起谈谈，我们有很多话都想对你说，但是我们知道你的工作太忙了，所以就一心一意在党的领导下，积极生产，搞好工厂以不辜负你的希望。
    解放至今，在生产上我们已经有了好多改善的地方，特别是在六月份里，为了迎接“七一”，签订了全厂集体合同，这个月里我们就有一百五十件创造新纪录、合理化建议和技术改进。
    现在报告你一件大喜事，我们为了迎接“七一”党的生日，已解决了跑煤粉问题，我们厂子在一九四六年装好两台煤粉炉，从运转到现在，每天磨煤机的煤粉，最少要跑五吨，跑掉的煤粉。飞满在石景山，附近居民呼吸、吃饭都会侵入很多煤粉，身体健康受很大的影响，很多工友生了肺病，同时，煤粉对机器、电气系统、磁瓶、绝缘，也有很大危害，这是我们的大敌人，几年来一直没能消灭，可是，今年我们在党的号召下，大伙儿都开动了脑筋，工人和工程师一起研究，提出许多合理化建议，又有苏联工程师帮忙，到六月二十日把跑煤粉问题基本上解决了。此外又附带着解决了磨煤机钢球比例的定额，在这些改进中，每年可省一百一十四万三千四百斤小米，合我们全体工友三个月的工资，而肉眼看不到的对人身和机器安全的好处，是无法统计的。
    现在我们全厂已卷入生产竞赛和开展合理化建议，创造新纪录的高潮中，我们有信心在党和你的领导下，搞好首都发电厂。祝你身体健康！
    石景山发电厂全体职工  六月二十九日
