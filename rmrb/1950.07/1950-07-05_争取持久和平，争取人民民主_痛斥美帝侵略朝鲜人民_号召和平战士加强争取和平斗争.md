　　"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy"
     Denounce U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against the Korean People
     Call on Peace Fighters to Strengthen the Struggle for Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th] The "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" newspaper, issue 86, published on June 30th, published a commentary entitled "U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against the Korean People," stating: "The recent events in Korea have once again fully exposed the ugly face of U.S. imperialism. Driven by the growing economic crisis and the growing internal difficulties and contradictions, angered by the powerful upsurge of the liberation movement of workers and progressive people in the suzerain states and colonies, and facing the powerful peace movement sweeping the globe like a storm; and deeply fearing that the tide of this people's movement will engulf and crush a small group of despicable war-mongers, U.S. imperialists are hurriedly organizing one provocation after another. And they have moved from preparing for aggression to direct acts of aggression."
    The commentary, after recounting how the Syngman Rhee gang, at the instigation and with the help of U.S. imperialism, launched provocations and fled in panic after being struck by the People's Army and border defense forces, said: "The Korean people have stood up as one." Thus, "the American aggressors have simply torn off the last fig leaf." The commentary denounced Truman's statement, the Security Council meeting convened under U.S. orders and the "decision," the bombing of Korean cities and villages by U.S. planes, and the hysterical cries of the bourgeois press like the echo of bombs. The commentary pointed out: But "the heroic Korean people are fighting for a unified, independent, and democratic nation. They are defending their country with weapons in their hands. They have proved that they will never tolerate being played with by American aggressors and warmongers, and this is the Korean people's best contribution to the cause of peace."
    The commentary concluded: The response of peace fighters to the recent acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism in Korea, China, and Vietnam is to further intensify the struggle for peace, a struggle that will thoroughly destroy the treacherous plans of the imperialists.
    This issue also published Kim Il-sung's long article "The Korean People are Fighting for a Unified, Independent, and Democratic Nation" and Kim Il-sung's letter to the Korean people. This issue also contained: An editorial commemorating the second anniversary of the Cominform's resolution on the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia: "The Struggle Against the Tito Group—The International Duty of Communists"; Duclos's "The People of the South Will Surely Eliminate the Traitorous Clique"; Sacha Chadiatis's "The Formation of the Athens-Belgrade Axis Threatens Peace," and other special articles, as well as Thorez's report at the French Communist Party Central Committee Plenary Session on June 23, "Unite in the Struggle for Peace, Freedom, and the Current Demands of the Working People."

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”
     痛斥美帝侵略朝鲜人民
     号召和平战士加强争取和平斗争
    【新华社布拉格四日电】六月三十日出版的《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》报第八十六期，发表题为《美帝国主义侵略朝鲜人民》的评论称：“最近在朝鲜发生的事件，又一次充分揭破了美帝国主义者的狰狞面目。美帝国主义者正被增长着的经济危机与增长着的内部困难和矛盾所驱策，为宗主国与殖民地中劳动者与进步人民的解放运动的强有力高涨所激怒，面临着暴风雨般席卷全球的强大和平运动；并且深恐这一人民运动的浪潮将吞没和粉碎一小撮卑鄙的战争贩子，所以就急急忙忙地组织了一个又一个的挑衅。并且已从准备侵略走到直接的侵略行为了。”
    评论在历述李承晚匪帮在美帝怂恿与帮助下发动挑衅，和受到了人民军与边防部队的打击仓皇南逃的经过后说：“朝鲜人民已像一个人一样地站立起来了”。这样，“美国侵略者就简直扯掉了最后的一块遮羞布”。评论痛斥杜鲁门声明，安理会在美国命令下召开的会议和“决定”，美机轰炸朝鲜城乡，以及像炸弹的回声一般的资产阶级报纸的歇斯的里的叫嚣。评论指出：但是，“英勇的朝鲜人民正为争取统一独立民主的国家而进行着斗争。他们手执武器保卫着国家。他们已证明决不忍受美国侵略者及战争贩子的玩弄，而这就是朝鲜人民对和平事业的最好贡献。”
    评论末称：和平战士们对美帝国主义最近在朝鲜、中国和越南的侵略行为的答复，就是要更大地加紧争取和平的斗争，这一斗争必将把帝国主义者背信弃义的计划彻底摧毁。
    本期并刊载了金日成的“朝鲜人民为统一独立和民主的国家而斗争”的长文和金日成告朝鲜人民书。本期还载有：纪念情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党情势的决议两周年的社论：“反对铁托集团的斗争——共产党的国际职责”；杜克洛的“南国人民必将清除卖国贼集团”；萨查利阿第斯的“雅典——贝尔格莱德轴心的形成威胁着和平”等专文，以及多列士在六月二十三日法共中央全会上的报告《在为和平自由与劳动人民当前要求而作的斗争中团结起来》的全文。
