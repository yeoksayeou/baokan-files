Dear Korean People and People's Army:

    The American imperialists and their adopted son, Syngman Rhee, have opened fire on the Korean people, bombing cities and villages, and murdering Koreans, which makes us Chinese peasants very angry. In your counter-offensive, you liberated Seoul in just three or four days, and in a little over ten days, you almost completely annihilated the Syngman Rhee reactionary troops and wiped out large numbers of American troops, just like we swat locusts. You fought wonderfully! We believe that you are fully capable of eliminating the domestic reactionaries and driving out the American imperialists, just as we are capable of eliminating cotton aphids. Hearing the news of your victory, I was as happy as if I had heard of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    The American imperialists, these great bullies, are trying to dominate the entire world. Their attack on Korea is also intended to prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and we will never allow the American imperialists to occupy it. I will lead the peasants to improve agricultural production, apply more fertilizer, increase processing, and prevent and control diseases and pests, so as to achieve intensive cultivation and produce more grain, and ensure a bumper harvest on all 900 mu of cotton in the whole village. On the one hand, we will support industrial construction, and on the other hand, we will support the front lines. We must and certainly will recover Taiwan and all the places in China that have not yet been liberated, and we will not allow the American imperialists to invade an inch of our land.

　　劳动模范宋洛学给朝鲜人民的信亲爱的朝鲜人民和人民军：
    美帝国主义和他的干儿子李承晚向朝鲜人民开火，轰炸城市、乡村，杀害朝鲜人民，使我们中国农民非常恼怒。你们在反攻中，只三、四天工夫就解放了汉城，十几天就把李承晚反动军队消灭了个差不多，并大批大批地歼灭了美国的军队，就像我们打蝗虫一样，你们打得真好！我们相信你们完全有把握消灭本国反动派和赶出美帝国主义，也就像我们消灭棉蚜虫一样有把握。听到你们的胜利消息，我就和听到我们中国人民解放军的胜利一样，实在高兴！
    美帝国主义这个大恶霸，妄想霸占全世界。它进攻朝鲜，还打算挡住中国人民解放军解放台湾。台湾是中国的地方，我们决不让美帝国主义霸占。我要带动农民，把农业生产搞好，多施肥、多加工、防除病害，作到精耕细作，多打粮食，保证全村九百亩棉花亩亩丰收。一面支援工业建设，一面支援前线。我们一定要而且一定能收复台湾和中国一切还没有解放的地方，不让美帝国主义侵略我国一寸土地。
