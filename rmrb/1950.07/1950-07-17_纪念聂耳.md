　　Commemorating Nie Er
　　Ma Sicong
　　The name Nie Er holds epoch-making value in the history of Chinese new music. Although he was only a twenty-four-year-old youth when he died, it was with the vigor of youth that he was able to break through from the old era into the new era, and express the spirit of the new era with new sounds.

　　From him onward, Chinese music had a majestic posture of leaping forward by great strides, and had melodies that were flesh and blood related to the people. These were not expressed before Nie Er, and were precisely the voices that the entire Chinese people urgently needed to shout out at that time.

　　"A single spark can start a prairie fire." Nie Er is a pioneer in the history of Chinese new music, and this "single spark" has now become a prairie fire.

　　At that time, Nie Er's voice matched the increasingly high anti-imperialist and anti-feudal emotions of the Chinese people, and encouraged the Chinese people's determination to fight to break free from the shackles imposed on us by imperialism and feudalism. This contribution is immortal! His voice not only encouraged the Chinese people more than a decade ago, but also continues to encourage us today. His March of the Volunteers, as the national anthem of the People's Republic of China today, precisely illustrates that his voice is still fresh today.

　　On the day of commemorating Nie Er, let us call on everyone to learn from his young, vigorous, heroic, courageous, and wholeheartedly serving the people spirit!

　　纪念聂耳
    马思聪
    聂耳这名字，在中国新音乐史上有着划时代的价值。虽然他死去的那一年还不过是二十四岁的青年，可就是靠着青年人的一股干劲，使他能够从旧时代冲进新时代，并且以新的声音把新时代的精神表现出来。
    从他开始，中国音乐有了大踏步向前飞跃的雄姿，有了与人民血肉相关连的旋律。这些都是在聂耳以前没有表现出来，而又正是整个中国人民在当时所迫切要喊出来的声音。
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”聂耳在中国的新音乐史上是一个开辟者，这“星星之火”现在已经成为燎原的大火了。
    聂耳的声音，在当时配合了中国人民日益高昂的反帝、反封建的情绪，鼓励了中国人民为挣脱帝国主义与封建主义加在我们身上的枷锁而斗争的决心。这功劳是不朽的！他的声音不单鼓励了十多年前的中国人民，同时也一直鼓励了今天的我们。他的义勇军进行曲今日作为中华人民共和国的国歌，正是说明，他的声音到今天还是新鲜的。
    在纪念聂耳的今天，让我们号召大家学习他那年青的、生命蓬勃的、英勇的、敢于搏斗的、全心全意为人民服务的精神！
