The Qingdao No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory and Twelve Other Units, All Officers and Soldiers of the 209th Division of the North China Military Region
Report Production Achievements to Chairman Mao

Qingdao No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory etc.

[Report from our newspaper] The Qingdao No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory, Chemical Factory, Shuttle Factory, and other factory branches, workshop committees, production teams, and other twelve units have separately written to Chairman Mao and Sister Chen Shaomin, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, reporting the glorious achievements of workers being masters of their own houses, managing factories, and actively producing in the year since liberation, as a gift for the Party's birthday.

The twelve letters report that: the bleaching powder section of the Chemical Factory is a newly established organization after liberation, and only started trial operations in November last year, but due to the in-depth development of the democratic inspection movement, the political awareness of workers has been rapidly improved. In the Red May competition, the production of bleaching powder exceeded the plan by 12%, the content of available chlorine gas increased by 7% compared with the plan, and the chlorine gas absorption efficiency created the highest record since the start of operations. The workers are now actively using their brains to find ways to protect machines and reduce costs. The workers in the Water and Electricity Department, in order to ensure production and increase power generation, repaired two old generators, breaking the situation where only one generator could be operated before liberation. At the same time, the department has never burned out a motor in the past year, nor has it hindered production due to machine repairs. The Electrolysis Department production team, in the Red May production, in addition to completing the production tasks, also formulated workshop labor covenants, security work plans, established a handover system, and improved reporting work through democratic discussion, and are now brewing a comprehensive and rational reform of work methods. The production scale of the lathe workshop of the Machinery Factory is gradually expanding, and the carding machines that could not be manufactured in the past are now being manufactured in large quantities. After the Red May competition, the product quality of the Shuttle Factory has been significantly improved, and there have also been great achievements in savings.

Under the leadership of the Party and the education of the trade union, the workers not only actively produce and create a large amount of wealth for the country, but also demand to study culture and improve their skills. Li Zisheng, a small worker in the Civil Engineering Department of the Chemical Factory, is a good example: before liberation, he did not know a single word and did not understand technology, and could only do odd jobs. After liberation, under the education of the Party, he worked hard to learn technology. In the past year, he not only understands technology, but also can lead work. After more than a month of study, he has learned more than 300 characters, so he realizes the profound meaning that "only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we have today."

The twelve letters unanimously stated: "We will never be complacent with this little achievement, we must continue to work hard and actively produce."

The 209th Division of the North China Military Region

[Report from our newspaper] All officers and soldiers of the 209th Division directly under the North China Military Region wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on June 27, reporting their achievements in participating in production as a gift for "July 1st." The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

We are implementing your 1950 instruction on the army participating in production, mainly digging the Yu River irrigation canal east of Datong and building barracks. We dug the Yu River canal from the Jing-Sui Railway southward (the area north of the Jing-Sui Railway is undertaken by other brother units). This section of the canal runs along the east bank of the Yu River, winding all the way to the Sanggan River, with a length of sixty-seven li, and about one million cubic meters of soil was dug. Now, in mid-June, the entire project has been completed. From now on, more than 100,000 mu of farmland east of Datong will no longer suffer from the "nine droughts in ten years" disaster, but will be transformed into paddy fields with bumper harvests every year. Therefore, the local people are very grateful to you, and they said: "Last year, Chairman Mao sent troops to liberate Datong, and we were also liberated; this year, Chairman Mao sent troops to dig the Yu River canal. Chairman Mao, with you, we ordinary people will never be poor again."

Dear Chairman Mao, you must be very interested in knowing how this canal was dug? In March, when all our officers and soldiers came here, the weather was still cold, and sandstorms often blew, but everyone said: "We are not afraid of the cold and wind, let's start work immediately!" Therefore, the entire project started on April 6. The soil in this area is very difficult to dig, it is a mixed soil formed by mountain floods over the years, with clay and stones. The iron shovel leaves a black mark when it steps on the clay, and the iron pickaxe sparks when it hits the stone. Although there were some difficulties, no one bowed their heads. At first, the comrades had blisters on their hands and swollen shoulders, but no one hid it from others, fearing that others would know and not let them dig the difficult places. Everyone said: "What does this count for, how much benefit will it bring to the people when the canal is dug!" In this way, everyone dug layer after layer, section after section, with songs and laughter every day, and beads of sweat fell from their faces, wiping them off and drying again, and constantly creating new records. At first, the average person in the entire division dug more than three cubic meters per day, then it was four and three cubic meters, and finally it was more than six cubic meters.

Today, we are holding the completion ceremony of the Yu River Canal. Representatives of the Chahar provincial party, government, and people, and local people are giving us award banners and medals, and we feel very honored.

In addition, the project of building barracks is also very huge. When we first came, the scattered thousands of barracks, due to the destruction by Yan bandit and sabotage by wreckers, most of the houses had no roofs, and some walls had collapsed. There were broken bricks and tiles everywhere, and weeds grew in the courtyard, and foxes and hares ran back and forth, which was extremely desolate. Such a large-scale construction project had difficulties in materials and technology at the time, so we had to ask some worker comrades for help. In addition, we also transferred various technical personnel from the troops and organized ironworker platoons and carpenter companies. Without tools, everyone made them by themselves; without materials, everyone collected them inside the barracks. First of all, the comrades of the ironworker platoon made 350 planes, two chaff cutters, 71 axes, more than 300 chisels, 26 mud trowels, and 100 bricklaying trowels. The comrades who participated in the construction concentrated every usable brick and tile, every usable piece of wood, and every nail and used them for construction. Everyone also went to carry water a mile or two away, not afraid of the cold, and took off their military trousers to mix mud in the water. Everyone worked actively and constantly improved production efficiency. The soldiers' selfless working spirit moved the worker comrades. They said: "In the past, one of our skilled workers could only lay 1,500 tiles (note: laying tiles on the roof), but now working with the comrades, we can lay 5,700 tiles a day." In this way, we built 1,898 barracks in two months, using more than 26,000 workdays in total, saving the country more than 400,000 catties of millet. Now everyone lives in new houses with glass windows, and the scenery is beautiful, and the sunlight and air are very good. We are grateful for your wise instruction of "creating wealth with labor"!

Dear Chairman Mao: Now, after the labor of digging canals and building barracks, our bodies are healthier, we are all black and strong, we eat more than before, and we are more capable of working than before. We have not forgotten cultural learning in labor. In more than two months, more than 70% of our division has learned more than 500 characters. You must be even happier to hear this news!

I wish you eternal health! With respect
All officers and soldiers of the 209th Division directly under the North China Military Region

　　青岛市中纺机械厂等十二单位  华北军区二○九师全体指战员
    上书毛主席报告生产成绩
    青岛中纺机械厂等
    【本报讯】青岛中纺机械厂、化工厂、梭管厂等各厂分会、车间委员会、生产小组等十二个单位分别上书毛主席及中国纺织工会筹备会主任陈少敏大姐，报告解放一年来工人当家作主，管理工厂，积极生产的光辉成绩，作为对党的生日的献礼。
    在十二封信中，报告了：化工厂漂粉部是解放后新建立的机构，在去年十一月才开始试工，但由于民主检查运动的深入开展，工人政治觉悟已迅速提高。在红五月竞赛中，漂白粉的产量超过计划百分之十二，有效氯气之含量较计划提高百分之七，氯气吸收效率则创造开工以来的最高纪录。工友们现正积极开动脑筋，设法保护机器，降低成本。水电部的工友为了保证生产，增加发电量，修好了两部旧发电机，突破解放前一直只能开一部发电机的现状。同时，该部一年来从未烧坏过一次马达，也没有因为修理机器而妨碍生产。电解部生产小组在红五月生产中，除完成生产任务外，并经过民主讨论制订了车间劳动公约、保安工作计划，建立了交接班制度，改进了表报工作，现正酝酿全面地合理地改革工作方法。机械厂车工场的生产规模则日渐扩大，过去不能制造的梳棉机，现正在大量制造。梭管厂经过红五月竞赛，产品质量显著提高，节约方面也有很大成绩。
    在党的领导和工会的教育下，工人们不仅积极生产，为国家创造了大量的财富，同时也要求努力学习文化，提高技术。化工厂土木部小工李自生就是一个很好的实例：解放前他不识一个字，也不懂技术，只能做点杂活。解放后在党的教育下，努力学习技术，一年来，他不仅懂得技术，而且可以领导工作。经过月余时间的学习，他已认识三百多字，因此他体会到：“只有在共产党的领导下，才能有今天”的深刻意义。
    在十二封信里都一致的提出：“我们决不以这一点成绩而自满，我们要继续努力，积极生产。”
     华北军区二○九师
    【本报讯】华北军区直属二○九师全体指战员于六月二十七日写信给毛主席，报告参加生产的成绩，作为“七一”献礼。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们执行你一九五○年军队参加生产的指示，主要是挖大同以东的御河灌溉渠和修建营房。御河大渠我们是从京绥线向南挖起的（京绥线以北由其他兄弟部队担任）。这段渠沿着御河东岸，曲曲弯弯直到桑乾河上，长有六十七华里，挖了大约有百万立方土。现在六月中旬，全部工程告竣。从此，大同以东的十万余亩田地将不再遭受“十年九旱”的灾害，而变成年年丰收的水田了。因此当地人民非常感激你，他们说：“去年毛主席派队伍解放大同，咱们也得了解放；今年毛主席又派队伍挖御河大渠。毛主席，咱们老百姓有了你，就永远不再受穷了。”
    亲爱的毛主席，你一定很想知道这道渠是怎样挖成的吧？三月里，当我们全体指战员来到这里的时候，天气还冷，时常刮起风沙，但大家都说：“天冷刮风咱不怕，马上开工吧！”因此就在四月六日全部动工了。这一带土质很难挖，是多年来山洪冲积而成的混杂土，有胶土，有石头，铁锨铲在胶土上一蹬一个黑印，铁镐刨在石头上便冒火星。虽然有些困难，但是大家谁也没有低头，起初同志们手上都打了血泡，肩也压肿了，但谁也瞒着不叫人知道，唯恐别人知道了不让自己再挖难挖的地方。大家都说：“这算什么，等渠挖好了，对人民有多大好处呀！”就这样大家挖了一层又一层，挖了一段又一段，每日里歌声加着笑声，豆大的汗珠从脸上落下来，擦一擦就又干起来，并且不断地创造了新的纪录，起初全师平均每人每天挖三方多，后来挖到四·三方，最后挖到六方多了。
    今天，我们正在举行御河渠落成典礼，察省党政民代表和当地人民给我们送奖旗奖章，我们觉得很光荣。
    另外，修建营房的工程也很浩大，我们刚来时，散乱的数千间营房，由于过去被阎匪的破坏和破坏分子的拆毁，绝大多数房屋都没屋顶，有的墙壁也已倒塌，到处都是破乱的砖瓦，院内杂草丛生，狐狸和野兔来回奔跑，真是荒凉之极。这样大规模的修建工程，当时材料和技术都有困难，因此不得不请一部分工人同志帮助。另外我们还在部队中抽调了各种技术人员，组织了铁工排、木工连。没有工具大家亲手制造；没有材料大家就在营房内部搜集。首先铁工排的同志打好了刨刀三百五十个，铡刀两把，斧子七十一把，凿子三百多把，泥抹子二十六个，瓦刀一百把。参加修建的同志们，把每块能用的砖瓦和每块能用的木料和每个钉子都集中起来用到建设上去。大家还到一二里外去抬水，不怕寒冷，争先脱下军裤下水合泥，大家积极劳动，不断提高生产效率。战士们这种忘我的工作精神激动了工人同志。他们说：“过去我们一个大工只能摆一千五百块瓦（按：在房顶上摆瓦），现在和同志们一块干，一天能摆五千七百块了。”这样，我们在两个月中修建了营房一千八百九十八间，共用工二万六千多个，给国家节省了四十多万斤小米，现在大家都住在镶了玻璃窗的新房子里了，而且风景优美，阳光空气都很好。我们感激你的“用劳动创造财富”的英明指示！
    亲爱的毛主席：现在我们经过挖渠和修建营房的劳动，身体都更健康了，一个个又黑又壮，饭比过去吃得多了，干工作也比过去更有能耐了。我们在劳动中也没有忘了文化学习，两个多月中，我们全师已有百分之七十以上的同志学会了五百字以上。这消息你听了一定更是喜欢的吧！
    祝你永远健康！此致敬礼
