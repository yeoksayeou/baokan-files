　　Ordnance Workers' Congress Passes Resolution
    Emphasizing Technical Study and Quality Improvement
    To Meet New National Defense Construction Tasks
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 10th] The First Congress of the Chinese Ordnance Workers' Union, held in Beijing from July 8th to 17th, passed the "Resolution on Studying Technology and Improving Quality" and submitted two suggestions to the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government regarding the implementation of labor insurance and the unification of working hours in the national ordnance production sector. Regarding the study of technology and the improvement of quality, the conference pointed out: In order to support the war to liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and especially to meet the new national defense construction tasks, all ordnance workers must learn to master new production technologies and improve product quality. Regarding specific methods for studying technology, the conference believes that: vocational schools for workers, secondary vocational schools for ordnance, apprentice training classes or apprentice schools should be established according to different circumstances, and special classes should be set up in industrial universities and senior industrial vocational schools according to the needs of ordnance, in order to cultivate ordnance technical personnel at all levels and improve the level of ordnance technology. Regarding the issue of improving product quality, the conference believes that a clear idea of quality first should be established among all ordnance workers, and workers should be mobilized and organized to establish and improve the production responsibility system, formulate and implement standard operating methods, establish and improve inspection systems at all levels, and sign contracts to guarantee production quality.
    The conference suggested to the Ministry of Heavy Industry: Before the promulgation of the National Labor Insurance Regulations, regions that have implemented labor insurance should temporarily implement it in accordance with the original regulations. Ordnance production departments that have not implemented it should temporarily implement labor insurance by referring to the principles of the current labor insurance regulations in Northeast China based on existing conditions. Regarding national ordnance working hours, the conference suggested that the government formally stipulate that all military production departments across the country implement an eight-hour working day, and that time outside of work should be used by the union to organize workers to study culture and technology. The above two suggestions have been approved by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government.
    The conference elected the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese Ordnance Workers' Union and the Finance Review Committee. The former is chaired by Zhao Guoqiang (concurrently), with He Ruilin as vice chairman, and the latter is chaired by Xia Ade.

　　兵工工会代表大会通过决议
    强调学习技术提高质量
    迎接新的国防建设任务
    【新华社十日讯】七月八日至十七日在北京召开的中国兵工工会第一次代表大会，通过了《关于学习技术、提高质量的决议》，及向中央人民政府重工业部提出的关于在全国兵工生产部门中实施劳动保险和统一全国兵工工时等两项建议。关于学习技术、提高质量，会议指出：为了支援解放台湾、西藏的战争，特别是为了迎接新的国防建设任务，全国兵工职工就必须学会掌握新的生产技术，改进产品质量。关于学习技术的具体办法，会议认为：应根据不同情况，分别设立职工业余学校、兵工中等职业学校、艺徒训练班或艺徒学校以及在工业大学及高级工业职业学校内按兵工需要设立专班，以培养各级不同的兵工技术人员，提高兵工技术水平。关于提高产品质量问题，会议认为应在全体兵工职工中树立质量第一的明确思想，动员组织职工建立与健全生产责任制、制定与实行标准作业法，建立与健全各级检查制度，订立各项保证生产质量的合同等。
    大会向重工业部建议：在全国劳动保险条例未颁布前，已实行劳动保险的地区，暂依原条例执行。未实行的兵工生产部门，暂依现有条件参考东北现行劳动保险条例原则，实施劳动保险。关于全国兵工工时，大会建议由政府正式规定全国军工生产部门一律实行八小时工作制，工作以外时间，统为工会组织职工学习文化、技术的时间。以上两项建议，均已得到中央人民政府重工业部的同意。
    大会选出了中国兵工工会全国委员会常务委员会和经费审查委员会。前者由赵国强兼主席，贺瑞林为副主席，后者由夏阿德任主任。
