　　Central and South China: Price Stability and Active Market
    Market Commodity Trading Volume Significantly Increased Compared to April
    [Hankou News] Changjiang Daily News: Since May, prices in the Central and South China region have generally trended towards stability, and market trading has gradually become more active.
    Taking the prices of six commodities—rice, oil, salt, cotton, yarn, and cloth—in the six major cities of the Central and South China region (Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Guangzhou, and Guilin) as examples: Comparing May with April, the average price in Hankou only fell by 0.23%, Nanchang rose by 0.36%, Changsha rose by 0.43%, Zhengzhou fell by 3.89%. Guangzhou and Guilin, due to their later liberation and the slower implementation of unified financial and economic work, had higher price baselines, so the decline was greater, with Guangzhou falling by 8.77% and Guilin falling by 11.51%.
    Individual commodity price situations also varied due to different conditions. Regarding grain, the current public and private reserves in cities are sufficient, and it is also the time for new wheat to enter the market. Rice prices in the six major cities generally fell in May, with Nanchang experiencing the smallest drop at 2.07% and Guangzhou the largest at 15.54%. In Wuhan, the state-owned grain company appropriately purchased yellow grain while launching retail sales with graded pricing. Rice prices stopped falling in late May. From May 31st to June 10th, the price of medium-quality rice in Hankou remained stable at 100,000 yuan per hundred jin. Other regions also became more stable in early June, with only Nanchang and Guangzhou experiencing a decline of about 4% or 5%. Cotton, under the circumstances of the central government's stipulated reasonable parity ratio, limited market reserves, and competitive purchasing by private factories, saw larger price fluctuations in various cities in May. For example, Changsha rose by 18.57%, Hankou rose by 14.95%, Nanchang rose by 4.44%, Guangzhou fell by less than 1%, Zhengzhou fell by 7.47%, and Guilin even fell by 32.24%. To strive for a reasonable parity ratio, the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company suspended cotton purchases in Wuhan from May 12th, which slightly moderated the price of cotton. In view of the continued rise in cotton prices, the company resumed selling large quantities of cotton on the market from June 7th to stabilize cotton prices. Comparing May 31st with June 10th, the price of cotton in Hankou only rose slightly by 0.71%. Other regions also remained relatively stable during the same period. In addition, cotton yarn and cloth prices fluctuated in various regions in May, but generally returned to stability in early June. Only edible oil experienced larger fluctuations. As for edible salt, except for a slight increase in Hankou and Zhengzhou in May, the other four cities saw a decline, with Guangzhou having the largest decline at 12.32%. In early June, due to tax reductions, prices in various regions fell proportionally.
    With state-owned trading companies actively adjusting prices and private industrial and commercial operators gradually eliminating unnecessary concerns due to the people's government's adjustments to industry and commerce and public-private relations, gradually turning to active operations, the market has gradually become more active. Taking Wuhan as an example, the total market transaction volume in May increased by about 10% compared to April. During the six weeks from May 1st to June 10th, except for occasional reductions in the transaction volume of individual commodities such as cotton, cloth, and edible oil, the transaction volume of other major commodities increased week by week. Comparing the first week (May 1st to 6th) with the sixth week (June 5th to 10th), rice increased from less than 890,000 jin to more than 2.9 million jin, an increase of more than two times; edible salt increased from more than 7,100 dan to more than 76,000 dan, an increase of nearly ten times; cotton increased from more than 1,100 dan to more than 3,200 dan, an increase of nearly two times. In addition, the transaction volume of cotton yarn and various exportable local products generally increased.

　　中南区物价平稳市场活跃
    市场商品交易量较四月份显著增加
    【汉口讯】长江日报消息：五月份以来，中南区物价一致趋向平稳，市场交易亦逐渐活跃。
    以中南区武汉、郑州、长沙、南昌、广州、桂林六大城市米、油、盐、花、纱、布六项物资的价格为例：各城市五月份和四月份比较，平均汉口仅落百分之○·二三，南昌升百分之○·三六，长沙升百分之○·四三，郑州落百分之三·八九，广州、桂林因解放较迟，执行统一财经工作收效较晚，而两地物价基数较高，故下落亦较多，计广州落百分之八·七七，桂林落百分之一一·五一。
    个别商品价格情况，亦因条件不同而有差异。就粮食说，目前城市公私存量充足，又值新麦登场，五月份六大城市米价普遍下落，其中南昌下落最少，为百分之二·○七，广州下落最多为百分之十五·五四。武汉因国营粮食公司一面适当收购黄谷，一面以分等定价方式展开零售，五月下旬粮价即停止下落，自五月三十一日到六月十日，汉口中等米价格一直保持每百斤十万元的水平。其他各地六月上旬亦更形平稳，仅南昌及广州下落约百分之四、五左右。棉花则在中央规定合理比价及市场存底不丰、私营厂商竞购的情形下，五月份各城市价格升降幅度较大，如长沙升百分之十八·五七，汉口升百分之十四·九五，南昌升百分之四·四四，广州下落不到百分之一，郑州落百分之七·四七，桂林竟落到百分之三二·二四。国营花纱布公司为了争取合理比价，在武汉曾于五月十二日起停止收购棉花，使花价稍见平和，鉴于花价仍继续上涨，该公司复自六月七日起在市场大量抛售棉花以稳定棉价，如以五月三十一日与六月十日相较，汉口花价仅微升百分之○·七一。其他各地同期内亦保持相对平稳。另外，棉纱、布匹五月份各地仍有起伏，六月上旬大体已回复平稳，仅食油涨落幅度较大。食盐则除五月份汉口、郑州略形上升外，其他四个城市均见下落，广州最多达百分之十二·三二。六月上旬因减税关系，各地并呈比例而下落。
    在国营贸易公司主动调整物价，私营工商业者亦因人民政府调整工商业与公私关系开始消除不必要的顾虑，逐渐转向积极经营，市场已渐趋活跃。以武汉市为例，五月份市场成交总量约较四月份增加百分之十。在五月一日至六月十日的六周间，除个别的如棉、布、食油成交量曾偶有减少外，其余各主要商品成交量均逐周增加。以第一周（五月一日至六日）与第六周（六月五日至十日）相较，大米由不到八十九万斤升到二百九十余万斤，增加两倍多；食盐由七千一百余担升到七万六千余担，增加近十倍；棉花由一千一百余担增至三千二百余担。增加近二倍。此外，棉纱和各种外销土产品的成交量一般都有增加。
