Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: In the past year or so, factories, railways, and mines in Northeast China have generally launched a technical learning movement for young workers. The main form of this technical learning is signing apprenticeship contracts, while also organizing technical learning classes, research groups, and mutual aid groups. Signing apprenticeship contracts is an improvement on the existing master-apprentice form in factories under the current material conditions, strengthening its planning. The Youth League has played a significant role in promoting this work.

According to incomplete statistics from Northeast China in March and April this year, more than 60,000 young workers participated in technical learning, including 8,500 in Shenyang, 15,800 in the Lushun-Dalian area, 4,500 in Andong, 18,000 under the Northeast Railway Bureau, and 14,000 in Harbin and eight other cities. After this technical learning, these young workers improved their working methods and generally increased productivity. For example, at the No. 2 Cloth Shoe Factory of the Harbin Clothing Bureau, after 13 apprentices signed apprenticeship contracts, shoe production doubled compared to before the contracts were signed, and there were very few defective products. At the Liaoxi No. 1 Machinery Factory in Jinzhou, lathe operator Lei Zhenxiang and his apprentice Zhu Qingzong were originally assigned two hours to turn a large wheel for a rotary hoe. After signing an apprenticeship contract, the master and apprentice worked together to create a new record of turning a large wheel for a rotary hoe in 14 minutes, exceeding the original standard time by more than eight and a half times. Over the past year and a half, the Dalian Railway Factory has trained 1,823 young technicians due to the development of technical learning. According to preliminary statistics from the Shenyang No. 4, No. 5, and Experimental Machine Factories, 153 apprentices have been promoted to technicians or semi-technicians after signing apprenticeship contracts.

Experience has shown that to sign apprenticeship contracts, it is first necessary to conduct education on respecting teachers and loving apprentices, dispel the ideological concerns of masters and apprentices, and improve the master-apprentice relationship. During the process, the Youth League and the trade union should cooperate closely, first through propaganda methods such as technical grievance meetings, master-apprentice forums, mass meetings, and blackboards, aiming at the incorrect ideas of masters like "teaching the apprentice starves the master" and of apprentices like "you have skills, I have politics," carrying out class education and explaining the importance of signing apprenticeship contracts, and then driving the masses to sign universally. Driven by Youth League members, the Dalian Shipyard had signed 153 apprenticeship contracts by mid-April. In the Qiqihar Railway Factory, 76 Youth League members among the apprentices led other apprentices to sign 145 contracts. Wang Xuegen, a Youth League member at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Factory, in addition to finding a master and signing a contract himself, also led six apprentices and masters to sign apprenticeship contracts. Youth League members in Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang, and other places also took the lead in promoting the movement to respect teachers and love apprentices, proactively helping masters with their work. The Dalian Railway Factory's Youth League General Branch made checking the master-apprentice relationship of its members one of the branch's regular tasks, thus greatly consolidating and developing the apprenticeship contract system.

Secondly, the content of the apprenticeship contract should be clear, specific, and realistic, and its implementation must be guaranteed. Some apprenticeship contracts signed in various places only vaguely propose to learn "ordinary small jobs on the lathe," which does not enable apprentices to learn techniques in a planned and step-by-step manner. The contracts must be carefully reviewed after they are drafted. After the contract is approved, the administration should take it into consideration as much as possible to ensure its implementation, and the principle of not transferring the production positions of masters and apprentices unless it is necessary for production should be followed.

Thirdly, to promote apprenticeship contracts, it is necessary to establish a system of examination, promotion, rewards, and regular inspections, and to promptly solve difficult problems in teaching. The Qiqihar Railway Factory signed apprenticeship contracts in conjunction with the implementation of a reward system. After three months of learning at work, 58 percent of the 154 apprentices were promoted, and 81 masters received awards. The Dalian Railway Factory also promoted more than 90 percent of apprentices because the apprenticeship contract was combined with a reward system. However, in some factories, because there was no certain system of examination, promotion, and reward, apprentices could not be promoted after learning, and masters did not receive any or very little rewards after teaching apprentices, making it difficult to consolidate apprenticeship contracts.

　　展开青年工人技术学习运动
    东北各工矿订师徒合同
    【新华社十七日讯】东北各地工厂、铁路、矿山一年多以来，普遍开展了青年工人技术学习运动。这种技术学习主要的形式是订立师徒教学合同，同时还组织技术学习班和研究组、互助组等。订立师徒合同是在现有物质条件下，根据工厂中原有的师傅带徒弟的形式，加以提高，并加强其计划性。青年团在这一工作中起了很大的推动作用。
    据东北各地今年三、四两月不完全统计，有六万多青年工人参加技术学习，其中沈阳八千五百人，旅大区一万五千八百人，安东四千五百人，东北铁路局所属一万八千人，以及哈尔滨等八个市一万四千人。这些青年工人经过了技术学习，改进了工作方法，普遍地提高了生产力。如哈尔滨市被服局布鞋二厂，十三个学徒订立师徒合同以后，鞋子产量较未订合同前增加两倍，并且废活很少。锦州辽西第一机械厂，车工雷振祥和他的学徒朱庆宗旋锄草机大轮，原标定两小时旋一个，订立师徒合同后经师徒共同钻研，创造了十四分钟旋一个锄草机大轮的新纪录，超过原标定工时八倍半。大连铁路工厂一年半来，因开展了技术学习，已培养了青年技工一千八百二十三名。据沈阳机器四厂、五厂及实验厂的初步统计，订立师徒合同以后徒工升为技工、半技工的已有一百五十三人。
    经验证明，要订立师徒合同，首先要进行尊师爱徒的教育，解除师徒的思想顾虑，搞好师徒关系。在进行过程中，青年团和工会要密切配合，先通过技术诉苦会、师徒座谈会、群众大会及黑板报等宣传方式，针对师傅的“教会徒弟、饿死师傅”和徒工的“你有技术、我有政治”等不正确的思想，进行了阶级教育，讲解了签订师徒合同的重要，然后带动群众普遍签订。大连船渠工厂在青年团员推动下，到四月中旬，已订了一百五十三份师徒合同。齐齐哈尔铁路工厂的徒工中有七十六名青年团员带动其他徒工，订了一百四十五份合同。沈阳机器一厂青年团员王学根除自己找师傅订好合同外，又带动了六名徒工和师傅签订师徒合同。旅大、沈阳等地青年团员并带头推行尊师爱徒运动，主动帮助师傅干活。大连铁路工厂青年团总支把检查团员的师徒关系定为支部经常工作之一，因而大大巩固和开展了师徒合同。
    其次，师徒合同的内容，要明确、具体，切合实际，并须保证其贯彻。各地订立的师徒合同中，有的只笼统地提出要学会“旋床上的普通小活”，这样就不能使徒弟有计划有步骤地学到技术。合同订出后必须进行慎重审查。合同批准以后，行政应尽量照顾，以便贯彻执行，如非因生产必需，以不调动师徒生产岗位为原则。
    第三，推行师徒合同，必须订出一定的考工升级奖励和经常检查的制度，并及时解决教学中的困难问题。齐齐哈尔铁路工厂订立师徒合同并结合奖励制度的实行，经三个月在工作中的学习，在一百五十四名徒工中，有百分之五十八升级，八十一名师傅获奖。大连铁路工厂也是因为师徒合同结合奖励制度，徒工中有百分之九十以上升了级。但有些工厂因为没有一定的考工升级和奖励制度，徒工学会不能升级，师父教会徒工也没有得到奖励或奖励很少，使师徒合同难于巩固。
