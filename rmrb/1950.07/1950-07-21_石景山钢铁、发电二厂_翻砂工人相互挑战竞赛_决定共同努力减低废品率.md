　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel, Power Plant No. 2
    Foundry Workers Challenge Each Other in Competition
    Decide to Work Together to Reduce Defect Rate
    [Report from this newspaper] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: Foundry workers from the repair department foundry of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the foundry of the casting department, and the casting worker team (foundry) of the repair shop of Shijingshan Power Plant No. 2, are launching a three-month production competition starting in July to greet the first anniversary of the founding of the nation on October 1st with production achievements. The two factories officially signed the competition contract on July 15th. This is the first production competition between factories in the capital. The competition contract stipulates that both parties jointly guarantee: (1) Fulfilling and exceeding production tasks. (2) Learning from each other and exchanging experiences; good methods will be introduced immediately. (3) Resolutely obeying the leadership of superiors and strictly observing labor discipline. (4) Exchanging work plans every half month and exchanging work summaries every month. (5) Accurate work estimation, with the administration responsible for estimation and the trade union group discussing it. Because the foundry departments of the two factories have different machine equipment, labor organization, and production characteristics, uniform regulations cannot be made for the competition conditions. Both parties will formulate specific guarantee conditions based on their existing foundations, and strive to reduce the defect rate, improve quality, and increase iron and carbon quotas month by month. For example, in the guarantee conditions set by the repair department foundry of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the cast iron defect rate should not exceed 4.3 percent in July, 4 percent in August, and 3.4 percent in September; and it is guaranteed that there will be no accidents in the use of machinery within three months, and no work-related injuries will occur during operation. The foundry of the casting department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant guarantees that each person will produce an average of more than two tons of iron work per month. The guarantee conditions of the casting worker team of the repair shop of the power plant also specifically stipulate the percentage of monthly reduction in the defect rate, and stipulate iron and carbon quotas: for a quarter-ton furnace, four kilograms of iron are melted per kilogram of coke, and for a half-ton furnace, six kilograms of iron are melted per kilogram of coke.
    Foundry workers from both factories have made full preparations to welcome this competition. The defect rate of the casting worker team of the repair shop of Shijingshan Power Plant No. 2 was statistically as high as 40 percent in January, February, March, and April of this year. After workers absorbed advanced experience and worked hard to improve, the defect rate had dropped to 3.58 percent by June. In the past, the repair department foundry of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant did not know how much the defect rate was. In order to participate in the competition, after more than half a month of effort, it has statistically calculated the average defect rate for the past three months. In the past, the repair department foundry and the casting department foundry of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant did not understand each other enough. This time, competing with the foundry workers of the power plant together has increased the connection between the foundry workers of the casting and repair departments. The foundry of the casting and repair departments also launched a competition.
    At the signing ceremony of the competition contract on July 15th, workers from the two factories spoke, unanimously expressing their confidence in completing the state's production tasks, and mutually guaranteeing to exchange production experience and exchange technical knowledge, and to further enhance the unity of the workers of the two factories through the competition. Liu Yingyuan, the old hero and director of Shijingshan Power Plant, spoke at the conference, hoping that everyone would carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and love and fight against defective products.

　　石景山钢铁、发电二厂
    翻砂工人相互挑战竞赛     
    决定共同努力减低废品率
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：石景山钢铁厂修理部翻砂场、铸造部翻砂场工人与石景山发电厂修理场铸工班（翻砂）工人，从七月份起，展开三个月的生产竞赛，以生产成绩迎接十月一日开国一周年纪念日。两厂已于七月十五日正式签订竞赛合同。这是首都第一个工厂与工厂之间的生产竞赛。在竞赛合同中规定双方共同保证：（一）完成和超过生产任务。（二）互相学习交流经验，好办法马上介绍出去。（三）坚决服从上级领导，严格遵守劳动纪律。（四）每半月交换工作计划一次，每月交换工作总结一次。（五）估工要准确，估工由行政负责，工会小组讨论。参加竞赛的两厂翻砂部门因机器设备、劳动组织、生产性质等各有不同，竞赛条件不能作统一规定，由双方分别在现有基础上订出具体保证条件，争取逐月减低废品率，提高质量，提高铁炭定额。如钢铁厂修理部翻砂场所订的保证条件中，铸铁废品率七月份不超过百分之四点三，八月份不超过百分之四，九月份不超过百分之三点四；并保证三个月中使用机器不出事故，在操作过程中不发生公伤。钢铁厂铸造部翻砂场保证每人每月平均出铁活二吨以上。发电厂修理场铸工班保证条件也具体定出逐月减低废品率的百分比，并规定铁炭定额：四分之一吨炉每公斤焦炭化铁四公斤，二分之一吨炉每一公斤焦炭化铁六公斤。
    两厂翻砂工人为迎接这次竞赛都作了充分的准备。石景山发电厂修理场铸工班废品率本年一、二、三、四月的统计达百分之四十，经工人吸取先进经验，努力改进，至六月份废品率已降至百分之三点五八。石景山钢铁厂修理部翻砂场过去不知道废品率有多少，为了参加竞赛，经半个多月的努力，已统计出过去三个月的平均废品率。钢铁厂修理部翻砂场与铸造部翻砂场过去互相了解不够，此次共同与发电厂翻砂工人竞赛，增加了铸造、修理两部翻砂工人间的联系。铸造、修理两部翻砂场也展开竞赛。
    在七月十五日竞赛合同签字大会上，两厂工人讲话，一致表示有信心完成国家生产任务，并互相保证交流生产经验，交流技术知识，通过竞赛进一步增进两厂工人的团结。石景山发电厂厂长刘英源老英雄在大会上讲话，希望大家发扬互助友爱精神，向废品作斗争。
