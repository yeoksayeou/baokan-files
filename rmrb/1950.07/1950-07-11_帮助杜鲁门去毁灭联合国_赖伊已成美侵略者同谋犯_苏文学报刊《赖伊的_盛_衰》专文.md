Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 8th, TASS dispatch: Lev Oshanin published an article in the Literary Gazette entitled "The Rise and Fall of Lie." Oshanin wrote: When Norwegian Foreign Minister Trygve Lie was elected Secretary-General of the United Nations, friends and acquaintances sent congratulatory letters and telegrams. Then, many people exaggeratedly toasted this "most upright, most noble," "supreme guardian of peace."

But today, more than four years after he became Secretary-General of the United Nations, no one would seriously call him the "most noble" or "most upright" person anymore.

Mr. Lie's uprightness made its last appearance last summer when he returned to Norway for vacation. He may have just remembered the bloody carnage of mankind in the recent war, or perhaps he remembered his own remarks about being friendly to the Soviet Union. In any case, he gave a clear assessment of the North Atlantic Treaty at a gathering in Bergen. He said: The so-called "regional cooperation" of an aggressive bloc pieced together under the guise of American imperialism can never replace the United Nations. The North Atlantic Treaty cannot be called a regional agreement that conforms to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, because it runs counter to the United Nations' mission of maintaining peace and security.

This speech almost ruined Mr. Lie's subsequent career. Overbearing cries resounded throughout Washington and London. Reactionary newspapers shrilled threateningly: A political leader who does not recognize the benefits of the Atlantic Treaty is "unworthy of his mission." Lie was dazed by this scare, and quickly abandoned his guise as a "knight of peace." He told the entire press: He—don't you understand?—was misunderstood, of course, the Atlantic Treaty is fully in line with the requirements of the United Nations Charter.

Today, the Secretary-General is doing everything possible to turn the United Nations into an affiliate of the U.S. State Department. Without his involvement, the United Nations Secretariat would not have allowed FBI agents, traitors to the Czech and other peoples, anti-Soviet hooligans among White Russian exiles, and people who serve the American rulers instead of serving the United Nations to gather there. He tolerated the shameless theft of information midway through the transmission of electricity in the United Nations Secretariat, as well as various other forms of American espionage. Trygve Lie, who was selected as a guardian of peace, has become an accomplice of the American aggressors by supporting the illegal "resolution" of the United Nations Security Council on the Korean issue.

Not long ago, Lie wore the mask of an objective arbitrator and traveled around European capitals on a "peace mission." Newspapers praised his "valuable initiatives." However, after Lie blatantly stood on the side of opposing peace and advocating aggressive war, what value does this "peace mission" have? The "valuable initiatives" were clearly just a trick to divert people's attention from the military adventures the Americans were preparing.

United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie obsequiously helps Truman and Acheson to destroy the United Nations. Mr. Lie is encouraging the American aggressors, and the American aggressors are trying—in the appropriate words of Italian progressive leader Nenni—"...to turn the United Nations into a little dog led by Truman on a leash." This status of the United Nations is clearly completely to his liking.

### 帮助杜鲁门去毁灭联合国  赖伊已成美侵略者同谋犯  苏文学报刊《赖伊的“盛”衰》专文

　　帮助杜鲁门去毁灭联合国
    赖伊已成美侵略者同谋犯
    苏文学报刊《赖伊的“盛”衰》专文
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：列夫·奥沙宁在文学报上发表题为《赖伊的盛衰》的一篇文章。奥沙宁写道：当挪威外交部长赖伊先生当选联合国秘书长时，朋友和相识都函电交驰地纷纷向他道贺。接着，便有许多人浮夸地为这位“最正直、最崇高”的“至高无上的和平卫士”干杯。
    但今天，在他任联合国秘书长四年多以后，再没有一个人会郑重其事地称他为“最崇高”或是“最正直”的人了。
    赖伊先生的正直在去年夏天他返挪威度假时作了最后一现。他也许刚好记起最近一次大战中人类鲜血横流的惨状，也许刚好记起他自己关于对苏友好的言论，无论如何，他是在卑尔根的集会上，对北大西洋公约作了明确的估价。他说：美帝国主义者在伪装下拚凑一个侵略集团的所谓“区域合作”，绝对不能代替联合国，北大西洋公约不能称为符合于联合国宪章精神的区域协定，因为它与旨在维护和平与安全的联合国的任务背道而驰。
    这一次演说几乎断送了赖伊先生其后的生涯。专横的叫嚣响彻了华盛顿和伦敦。反动的报纸恫吓地尖声叫嚷说：不认识大西洋公约的好处的政治领袖，“与其使命不相当”。赖伊被这吓得神智昏迷，便赶紧抛弃了“和平骑士”的装束。他对整个新闻界说：他——你们难道不明白吗——被人误解了，当然，大西洋公约是完全符合联合国宪章的要求的。
    今天，秘书长竭尽一切方法使联合国变成美国国务院的附属机关。如果没有他参与其事，那么，联合国秘书处就不能让美国联邦调查局的特务、捷克及其他各族人民的叛徒、白卫军流亡者当中的反苏流氓、不是为联合国服务而是为美国统治者服务的人们麇集其中。他容忍在联合国秘书处中无耻地从电线传送电流中途盗取消息，以及其他各种形式的美国间谍活动。被遴选为和平卫士的赖伊由于支持联合国安理会对朝鲜问题的非法“决议”，已成为美国侵略者的同谋犯。
    不久以前，赖伊还戴上了客观的仲裁人的假面具，负着“和平使命”，周游欧洲各国首都。各报都极口称颂他那“有价值的倡议”。然而，在赖伊露骨地站在反对和平方面并赞成侵略战争之后，这种“和平使命”又有什么价值呢？“有价值的倡议”显然不过是企图使人们不注意美国人正在准备的军事冒险的诡计罢了。
    联合国秘书长赖伊奴颜婢膝地帮助杜鲁门和艾奇逊去毁灭联合国。赖伊先生在鼓励美国侵略者，而美国侵略者则正在力图——用意大利进步领袖南尼恰当的话来说——“……把联合国变成将由杜鲁门牵着皮带的小犬”。联合国的这种地位显然是完全投他所好的。
