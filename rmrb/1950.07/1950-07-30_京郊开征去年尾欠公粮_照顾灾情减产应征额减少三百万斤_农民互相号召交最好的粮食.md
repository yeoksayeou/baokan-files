[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] The summer collection of public grain in the suburbs of Beijing began on the 27th of this month and is expected to be completed before August 10th. The public grain collected this time is part of the 1949 agricultural tax and its surcharges. The 1949 agricultural tax and supplementary village expenses in the suburbs of Beijing were collected once last autumn, leaving 7,157,123 jin to be collected this summer. This year, wheat in the suburbs of Beijing generally suffered from diseases such as jaundice, black jaundice, and black ear, and some wheat fields were also hit by wind and insect pests. The summer harvest was only 73.7% of the normal yield. In order to take care of these disasters and the actual capabilities of all classes in the suburbs after the land reform, the Beijing Municipal People's Government decided to further reduce the requisitioned grain amount to 3,855,446 jin.

On the 19th of this month, the Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government convened a joint meeting of district heads and finance section chiefs from various districts in the suburbs to reallocate the summer requisition tasks. After the meeting, the district governments convened village cadre meetings to convey and discuss the spirit of this collection work and the methods for reducing and exempting public grain. It was unanimously proposed that in-depth mobilization and full democratic appraisal should be carried out; attention should be paid to overcoming the work style of coercion and commandism; and the amount of grain reduced or exempted for each village and household should be as fair and reasonable as possible. Under the leadership of the district governments, summer requisition work committees were established in each district, and these committees organized some staff members from various agencies and organizations in the district to form work teams and go to various villages to supervise and inspect the collection work. In order to do a good job in the appraisal work, appraisal committees were generally elected in each administrative village. The appraisal committees included representatives from each natural village and paid attention to absorbing some middle peasants to participate. The general appraisal steps were to first convene mass meetings for democratic discussion; after the appraisal committee's appraisal, the appraisal results were announced publicly to continue to listen to the opinions of the masses; and then a final decision was made after a re-appraisal. This pragmatic and democratic style is deeply welcomed by the peasants in the suburbs of Beijing.

Many farmers said: "It was postponed last year, and reduced and exempted this year. The government really takes care of us." Some farmers proposed: "The public grain handed over must be clean and dry." They mutually called on each other: "Hand over the best grain to the public." Some farmers said: "Even if we eat a little less, we must hand in enough public grain to fight Taiwan!"

　　京郊开征去年尾欠公粮
    照顾灾情减产应征额减少三百万斤
    农民互相号召交最好的粮食
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊各区夏季征收公粮工作已自本月二十七日开始，预计八月十日以前完成。这次征收的公粮是一九四九年度农业税及其附加税的一部分。一九四九年度京郊农业税和附加的村经费已于去年秋季征收一次，剩下七百十五万七千一百二十三斤延至今年夏季征收。今年京郊麦子普遍发生黄疸、黑疸和黑穗等病害，部分麦田并遭受风灾和虫害，夏收仅为常年产量的七·三七成。京市人民政府为照顾这些灾情及土地改革后郊区各阶层的实际能力，决定再将这次应征粮额减为三百八十五万五千四百四十六斤。
    本月十九日，市府郊区工作委员会曾召集郊区各区区长和财政科科长举行联席会议，重新分配夏征任务。会后各区区政府分别召集了村干部会议传达和讨论这次征收工作的精神及公粮减免办法。一致提出：要进行深入的动员和充分的民主评议；注意克服强迫命令的作风；各村各户所减免的粮额要尽量做到公平合理。在区政府领导下，各区成立了夏征工作委员会，由该委员会组织区内各机关、团体的一部分工作人员，组成工作队，分赴各村督促、检查征收工作。为了做好评议工作，各行政村普遍选举了评议委员，组成评议委员会。评议委员会包括了每一自然村的代表，并注意吸收了一些中农参加。一般的评议步骤是先召集群众会议进行民主讨论；经评议委员会评议后，出榜公告评议结果，继续听取群众意见；再经复评作最后决定。这种实事求是的民主作风，深为京郊农民欢迎。
    很多农民说：去年缓征了，今年又减免，政府对咱真照顾。有的农民提出：“交出的公粮，一要干净，二要干燥。”他们互相号召：“交最好的粮食给公家。”有的农民说：“就是少吃一点，也要交足公粮打台湾！”
