Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 23rd: After suffering severe defeats, the American interventionist forces in Korea, enraged, have continuously and indiscriminately bombed peaceful residential areas in Wonsan, Gangwon Province, on the east coast. On July 6th, 7th, 13th, and 14th, a total of 41 American planes (mainly B-29 bombers) came to bomb the city seven times, dropping a total of 580 heavy bombs weighing from 500 kilograms to 1 ton on the city's hospitals, civilian houses, workers' dormitories, schools, student dormitories, and shops, and indiscriminately strafing with rockets and machine guns. This atrocity by American planes has resulted in the following blood debt owed to the Korean people: 442 peaceful residents killed and 267 wounded. In addition, more than 1,300 houses were destroyed, including the clearly marked Red Cross Hospital, Central Hospital, Dermatology Hospital, Railway Hospital, Social Insurance Sanatorium (two locations), and the Tie Shan-li People's School, the Third People's School, the Fourth Girls' Middle School, and the Korean Committee for the Defense of World Peace in Gangwon Province. In the workers' dormitory in Puhari (street name), more than 130 rooms were completely reduced to ruins. Of the more than 50 worker families living there, every family suffered casualties. The city's Federation of Trade Unions' workers' recreation center was also bombed, and 170 workers were killed.
　　The bestial bombing by the American aggressors has further aroused the common hatred of the Korean people. Zheng Yuanzhe, a worker in Puhari, said that after his wife was killed in the bombing, he immediately sent his children to the nursery and joined the production shock brigade, working tirelessly in the factory to support the front lines, defend the motherland, and must demand a blood debt from the American vampires.

　　美机滥炸元山和平居民激起朝鲜人民巨大愤恨
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜的美国干涉军在遭受严重的失败后，竟恼羞成怒地连续以飞机狂炸东海岸江原道元山市的和平居民区。在七月六日、七日、十三日及十四日四天中，前来滥炸的美国飞机共计四十一架（其中主要是Ｂ二十九型轰炸机），先后七次向该市医院、民房、工人宿舍、学校、学生宿舍以及商店投掷五百公斤到一吨的重磅炸弹共五百八十颗，并以火箭炮与机关枪滥肆扫射。美国飞机这一暴行对朝鲜人民所欠下的血债是：炸死和平居民四百四十二人，炸伤二百六十七人。此外并炸毁房舍一千三百余所，包括标志显明的红十字医院、中央医院、皮肤病医院、铁路医院、社会保险疗养所（两处），及铁山里人民学校、第三人民学校、第四女子中学以及朝鲜拥护世界和平江原道委员会等。在浦下里（街道名）的工人宿舍，一百三十余间房屋全成废墟。居住该处的工人家庭五十余户，每户都有死伤。市总工会工人休息所也遭受到轰炸，被炸死的工人达一百七十余名。
    美国侵略者的兽性轰炸，益发激起了朝鲜人民的同仇敌忾。该市浦下里的工人郑元哲说：他的妻子被炸死后，他立刻把孩子送交托儿所，自己参加了生产突击队，努力不懈地在工厂工作，支援前线，保卫祖国，一定要向美国吸血鬼索还血债。
