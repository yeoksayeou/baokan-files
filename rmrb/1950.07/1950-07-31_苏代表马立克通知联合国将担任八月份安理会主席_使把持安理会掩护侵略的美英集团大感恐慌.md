Xinhua News Agency, Successful Lake Dispatch: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Soviet Representative to the United Nations Security Council, Malik, notified UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 27th that he would assume the presidency of the Security Council in August of this year, and decided to convene a Security Council meeting on August 1. Malik also said: The agenda for the meeting will be notified later. According to the rules, the presidency of the Security Council is held in rotation by each member state in the order of the first letter of the country's name in English. Soviet Representative Malik should legally assume the presidency in August. According to the rules of procedure of the Security Council, the functions of the President of the Security Council are to convene all meetings other than regular meetings, approve the provisional agenda prepared by the Secretary-General, and make rulings on procedural issues raised by representatives. Its rulings are valid unless overruled (requiring a majority of seven votes). The speeches of all representatives must be approved by the President.

Malik's notification to Lie has caused great panic among the US-British group, which now controls the Security Council and uses it as a tool to cover up wars of aggression. According to TASS reports: The Norwegian representative, Sunde, the president of the Security Council in July, designated the 31st for another meeting at the Security Council meeting on the 28th. "Sunde's decision allowed the representatives of the US-British group to continue behind-the-scenes talks and convene another meeting before Soviet Representative Malik takes over as President of the Security Council on August 1."

　　苏代表马立克通知联合国将担任八月份安理会主席
    使把持安理会掩护侵略的美英集团大感恐慌
    【新华社三十日讯】成功湖消息：苏联副外长、苏联驻联合国安全理事会代表马立克，于二十七日通知联合国秘书长赖伊称，他将担任本年八月份安全理事会主席的职务，并决定在八月一日召集安理会会议。马立克并说：关于会议议程随后即将通知。按安理会主席由各理事国按照各国英文国名第一个字母之次序轮流担任，苏联代表马立克依法应担任八月份主席。按照安理会之议事规则，安理会主席之职权为召开除定期会议以外之一切会议，批准由秘书长拟定之临时议程，对代表提出之程序问题作裁决，其裁决除非被否决（须以七票多数为之），即属有效。各代表之发言须经主席认可。
    马立克给赖伊的通知，已使现在把持安理会、使之成为掩护侵略战争之工具的美英集团大感恐慌。据塔斯社报道：七月份安理会主席挪威代表森德在安理会二十八日的会议上，曾指定三十一日再度开会。“森德的此项决定，使美英集团代表得以继续赶作幕后会谈，并在苏联代表马立克于八月一日接任安理会主席之前再召开一次会议”。
