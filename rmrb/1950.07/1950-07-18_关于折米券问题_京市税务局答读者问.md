　　On the Issue of Rice Coupon Refunds
　　Beijing Tax Bureau Answers Reader Questions
　　Question: In early spring, when the government issued rice coupons, I bought several hundred catties of real estate tax rice coupons for the whole year. The listed price at that time was 1,600 yuan. Now that the price of rice has fallen, can the government refund me the price I paid for the rice coupons? Otherwise, my loss will be too great.
                                     (Zhang Ying)
　　Answer: From a practical point of view, price fluctuations do not disadvantage rice coupon holders. This is because the rice coupons are equivalent to the amount of rice they will be redeemed for in the future. Whether the price of rice is high or low when purchasing rice coupons, the government pays according to the standard of the rice price received that day. For example, on February 16th of this year, the treasury's rice price was 1,600 yuan. When the government receives the rice coupon payment, it will use 1,600 yuan as the standard for payment on that day. The issuance of rice coupons is to implement the resolution of the Second Session of the First People's Representative Conference of Beijing, and it is for the benefit of the broad masses of people. In order to take care of the government's finances, which is also for the benefit of the broad masses of people, rice coupon holders should not demand a refund from the government at the price the rice coupons were sold for because the price of rice has fallen. Otherwise, the government's finances will be in trouble.

　　关于折米券问题
    京市税务局答读者问
    问：我在春初政府发售折米券时，就买妥全年的房地产税折米券数百斤，那时的牌价是一千六百元，现在米价跌落，请问政府是否可以按我买米票时价格退款？否则我的损失太大了。
                                     （张瑛）
    答：物价涨落，从实物观点上说对于折米券的持有人并不吃亏。因为折米券与他将来所折兑的米数是相等的。购买折米券时，无论米价高低，政府在财政上是按照当日收入米价的标准来支付的。例如本年二月十六日的金库米价是一六○○元，政府收到折米券券款时，在财政上当日即以一六○○元作为支付的标准。折米券的发行，是执行北京市第二届一次各界人民代表会议的决议，是为广大人民利益出发的。为了照顾政府财政，也就是为了广大人民的利益，折米券的持有人不应该因为米价下跌而要求政府按折米券售出价退款。否则政府财政就会发生困难。
