　　Beijing Post Office Launches "Cash on Delivery" Service
    The Beijing Postal Administration and its affiliated bureaus have been ordered to launch "Cash on Delivery" service starting July 15th. The nature of this service is that both buyer and seller agree to entrust the post office to send the traded goods as mail to the buyer and collect the price from the buyer to be remitted to the seller. All post offices nationwide, except in the Northeast region, that can handle money orders can accept and send "parcels," "small packages," "booklet packages," and "various registered or insured letters," etc., for cash-on-delivery packages.
    The bureau has recently been ordered that for letters and documents sent by various government agencies and organizations, if they are of an official nature, regardless of whether they are entirely mimeographed or machine-printed, they must be sent as letters and not as printed matter.
