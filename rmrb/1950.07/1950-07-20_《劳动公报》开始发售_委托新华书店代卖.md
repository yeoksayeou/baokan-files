　　"Labor Gazette" Begins Sales; Entrusted to Xinhua Bookstore for Distribution

　　The Labor Gazette, published by the General Office of the Ministry of Labor of the Central Government, was originally not for sale. Since the publication of the first issue, academic and business circles in various regions have frequently requested free copies or requested to purchase them. Now, in order to meet the needs of all sectors, the General Office has specially printed copies for sale, and has entrusted Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing to sell them. The contents of the newspaper: the first issue focuses on work reports from local labor bureaus; the second issue centers on the National Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference; the third issue focuses on the Trade Union Law, and the problem of relief for unemployed workers. All labor policies, and important central and local labor laws and regulations, are published in detail.
