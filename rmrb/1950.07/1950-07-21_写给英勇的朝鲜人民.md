　　To the heroic Korean people
    (I) To our Korean democratic youth friends:
    You are engaged in a heroic battle with the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang for the liberation of your motherland. Your heroic actions in defending your country move our hearts.
    Our motherland, for a very long period, also suffered the ravages of imperialism and domestic reactionaries. They used cruel methods to suppress the Chinese people. However, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, all the Chinese people united around the Communist Party, carried out a long and arduous struggle, and finally achieved victory, establishing a new China belonging to the people. This shows that the strength of the people is invincible, and all imperialists and their running dogs who want to reverse the wheels of history will surely be crushed by the power of the people. We are convinced that under the leadership of the wise leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people will also drive out American imperialism and quickly eliminate the Syngman Rhee gang.
    Let us congratulate you on your victory and wish for the early realization of Korean unification. And we extend to you our highest salute of friendship and love.
                                  China New Democratic Youth League
                                  All members of the Shijingshan Power Plant League Branch
    (II) Heroic Korean people:
    We—all the students of Peking University in China, here extend our warm congratulations and fraternal greetings to you who are fighting heroically and to your leader General Kim Il-sung!
    Your just war of liberation against American aggression and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee gang, has already achieved brilliant results in a very short period. We feel infinitely happy about this! We are always concerned about your great struggle, and every victory you achieve gives us the greatest excitement!
    Your anti-aggression war is unanimously concerned and supported by peace-loving and democratic people all over the world. You have the wise leader General Kim Il-sung, the heroic and skilled Korean People's Army, and even more so, the people of the world as your loyal friends. You will inevitably and thoroughly eliminate the American aggressor army and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee gang, and completely liberate the Korean territory. Here we congratulate the Korean people on the realization of independence, freedom, democracy and unification. In the struggle for peace and democracy, we will always be your most loyal comrades-in-arms!
                                        All students of Peking University

　　写给英勇的朝鲜人民
    （一）朝鲜民主青年朋友们：
    您们为着祖国的解放，和美国侵略者及李承晚匪帮进行着英勇的战斗。您们保卫祖国的英雄行为，激动着我们的心。
    我们的祖国，在一个很长的时期里，也曾受着帝国主义和国内反动派的蹂躏。他们用残酷的手段，镇压着中国人民。但是，在毛主席领导下，全中国人民团结在共产党的周围，进行了长期而艰苦的斗争，终于取得了胜利，建立了属于人民的新中国。这说明了人民的力量是不可战胜的，一切想倒转历史巨轮的帝国主义和它的走狗一定会被人民力量所粉碎的。我们确信：在朝鲜人民英明的领袖金日成将军的领导下，朝鲜人民也一定会赶走美帝国主义，把李承晚匪帮迅速消灭。
    让我们祝贺您们的胜利，预祝朝鲜统一的早日实现。并向您们致崇高的友爱的敬礼
                                  中国新民主主义青年团
                                  石景山发电厂全体团员
    （二）英勇的朝鲜人民：
    我们——中国北京大学全体学生，在这里向英勇战斗着的你们及你们的领袖金日成将军致以热烈的祝贺和兄弟的敬礼！
    你们反抗美国侵略及其走狗李承晚匪帮的正义的解放战争，在极短期间就已经获得了辉煌的战果。我们为此感到无限的欢欣！我们时刻在关怀你们的伟大斗争，你们所获取的一切胜利，都给予我们以最大的兴奋！
    你们的反侵略战争，是为全世界爱好和平民主的人士所一致关心和支持的。你们有英明的领袖金日成将军，有英勇善战的朝鲜人民军，更有全世界的人民作你们的忠诚朋友，你们必然会迅速彻底地消灭美国侵略军及其走狗李承晚匪帮，完全解放朝鲜国土。我们在这里祝贺朝鲜人民的独立、自由、民主与统一实现。在争取和平与民主的斗争中，我们永远是你们最忠实的战友！
                                        北大全体同学
