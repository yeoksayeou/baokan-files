　　CCP Central Committee Southwest Bureau Directly Subordinate Organs

    Studying Documents, Strengthening Criticism, Rectification Campaign Initially Unfolded
    [Chongqing News] Chongqing Xinhua Daily News: The Party Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the CCP Central Committee Southwest Bureau convened a meeting on the 17th of last month to review the study of rectification documents by various units over the past week, in order to promote the rectification movement in the directly subordinate organs. According to the results of the review, all units have combined theory with practice, promoted democracy, and launched criticism and self-criticism to varying degrees. Beneficial opinions have been put forward among comrades or towards leading comrades. For example, some comrades criticized the leadership for failing to put political and ideological leadership first, and in their work they only continuously assigned tasks downwards, lacking concrete help and review and summary of work, thus falling into a circle of事務ism. It was also pointed out that such a leadership style could neither overcome abnormal phenomena such as delays and chaos, nor could it solve ideological problems in a timely manner, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres. In addition, most comrades have also begun to address their own issues of status and reputation. Overall, the study this week has been successful and the development is normal. The shortcoming is that a few units, due to urgent tasks, failed to conduct thorough and adequate ideological mobilization, so the study of criticism and self-criticism documents was not deep enough, and some deviations occurred in the process of criticism, such as doubts about self-criticism. The Party Committee of the directly subordinate organs, based on this review, made it clear that launching criticism and self-criticism is the main key to whether or not the improvement of work and the transformation of thought can be achieved. Therefore, the following opinions were put forward to various units: 1. Each unit should arrange next week's study according to the specific situation of the unit: those who have not yet launched the study well and whose thoughts are not yet mature should continue to study the criticism and self-criticism documents in depth. The leadership should pay attention to promoting democracy, advocating freedom of thought, and encouraging comrades who dare to criticize, in order to launch criticism and self-criticism. In study, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to seize the time, but also not to be afraid of delaying the time and reluctantly force it, otherwise it will become a formality, and as a result, the rectification task can be completed on schedule, but the purpose of rectification cannot be achieved. 2. The week of study fully demonstrated that the responsible comrades personally taking action is an important key to enabling the movement to unfold well and maintain normal development. The responsible comrades of all organs should implement this point. When the movement unfolds, they should personally mobilize and promote democracy, explain the purpose of rectification, and call on everyone to speak out on all issues. Otherwise, it will be impossible to solve various problems. 3. Key rectification should be well combined with general criticism. Attention should be paid to absorbing the criticism of general comrades, and general comrades should be cultivated in criticism and self-criticism, in the hope that after the rectification movement, all comrades will improve a step, and some new features will appear in their work.

　　中共中央西南局直属机关
    学习文件加强批评  整风运动初步展开
    【重庆讯】重庆新华日报消息：中共中央西南局直属机关党委会为推进直属机关的整风运动，于上月十七日召开会议，检查了一周来各单位对整风文件的学习情况。根据检查结果，一周来各单位均结合了实际，发扬了民主，展开了不同程度上的批评与自我批评，在同志们相互之间或对领导同志，都提出了有益的意见。如有一些同志批评领导方面未能将政治领导和思想领导放在第一位，在工作上只是不断的往下交任务，而缺乏具体帮助与检查总结工作，因之陷入了事务主义的圈子。并指出这样的领导方式既不能克服拖延忙乱等不正常的现象，又不能及时解决思想问题，充分发挥干部的积极性与创造性。此外，大部同志也开始端出了自己思想上的地位名誉等问题。总的看来，这一周学习是有成绩的，发展是正常的。缺点是少数单位由于任务紧迫，未能反复充分进行思想动员，所以对批评与自我批评文件学习不深刻，在进行批评中发生了一些偏差，如对自我批评怀疑等。该直属机关党委会从这一次检查中，明确了展开批评与自我批评是能否达到改进工作、改造思想的主要关键，因此向各单位提出了以下意见。一、各单位应根据本单位的具体情况布置下周学习：学习尚未很好展开和思想还不成熟的，应继续深入学习批评与自我批评文件。领导方面应注意发扬民主，倡导自由思想，对敢于批评的同志给以鼓励，以便展开批评与自我批评。在学习中既要集中力量抓紧时间，又不能怕拖延了时间而勉强硬搞，否则就会流于形式，其结果整风任务虽然可以按期完成，但整风目的则不能达到。二、在一周的学习中充分说明了负责同志亲自动手，是使运动能够很好展开并保持正常发展的重要关键。各机关负责同志应贯彻此点，在运动展开时，要亲自动员发扬民主，讲明整风目的，号召大家将所有问题讲出。否则是无法来解决各种问题的。三、重点整风要和一般批评很好地结合起来，要注意吸收一般同志的批评，要在批评与自我批评中培养一般同志，以期经过整风运动使所有的同志都提高一步，而在工作上呈现出一些新的面貌。
