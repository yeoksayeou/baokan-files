　　The founding of the Communist Party of China marks its 29th anniversary today. The Communist Party of China has grown from a small group of Marxists 29 years ago into a large party with more than five million members, leading the people to achieve historically significant great victories and becoming the founder and leader of the People's Republic of China. The huge central task now facing the Communist Party of China, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in his report to the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, is to fundamentally improve the economic and financial situation of the young republic born from a long war, and the primary step that must be taken for this purpose is to carry out land reform in the newly liberated areas in a planned manner. In order to promptly organize and consolidate its ranks after the victory, and to strengthen its ties with the broad masses of the people, so as to smoothly complete the new tasks, the CPC Central Committee has decided to launch a movement to rectify the work style of the entire party. For the same purpose, the CPC Central Committee has also decided to improve the party's organizational situation, adjust the composition of party members, and improve the quality of party members.

　　The glorious victory of the Communist Party of China is inseparable from its correct work style. What is the work style of the Chinese Communists? Comrade Mao Zedong said at the Party's Seventh National Congress five years ago:

　　"From its very beginning, our Party has been a party based on the theory of Marxism, because this doctrine is the crystallization of the most correct and revolutionary scientific thought of the world proletariat. Once the universal truth of Marxism is integrated with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, it has completely changed the face of the Chinese revolution and produced the entire historical stage of new democracy. The Chinese Communist Party, armed with the theoretical thought of Marxism, has created a new work style among the Chinese people, which is mainly the style of integrating theory with practice, the style of close contact with the masses of the people, and the style of self-criticism."

　　Of course, the formation of this work style of our Party is a historical process. In its twenty-nine years of development, our Party has experienced some twists and turns. Fundamentally speaking, these twists and turns, in addition to the strong oppression of the enemy, were also due to the fact that the Party's leadership temporarily violated the principle of integrating theory with practice, thus weakening its ties with the masses of the people. However, by implementing criticism and self-criticism within the Party, these shortcomings and errors in leadership have been corrected. Since the establishment of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong in January 1935, the leadership of the Party Central Committee has always been correct, and thus the Chinese revolution has also shown a stable upward trend. Due to the correctness and success of the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and due to the fact that the vast majority of party members and cadres closely united under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, implemented correct lines and policies, learned the correct work style, and worked diligently and arduously, the Party has gained extremely high prestige among the people.

　　As mentioned above, one of the important aspects of our Party's work style is the style of self-criticism. Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee often use the method of self-criticism to educate the Party, in order to ensure that all comrades in the Party constantly correct the shortcomings and errors in their work and ensure the progress of the Party's cause; and the method of rectification movements that the Party Central Committee has repeatedly led and carried out within the entire Party is a large-scale method of self-criticism. In view of the fact that in the past year, many shortcomings and errors, especially the error of commandism, occurred in the Party's work amidst great victories, the Party Central Committee recently decided to hold a new rectification movement to fundamentally and systematically correct these shortcomings and errors. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his speech at the May Day celebration this year:

　　"Since April 20th last year, when the People's Liberation Army's field armies began to march towards the south and northwest, within a very short period of time, all of mainland China except Tibet, including areas with a population of over 300 million, has been liberated. The areas we occupied are so large, and the various tasks are extremely heavy and complex. There are insufficient experienced cadres, a large number of new cadres have been absorbed, and there has not been time to conduct rectification and training. Therefore, along with great achievements, many shortcomings and errors have occurred in the work. We must look at the problem comprehensively; we should see both the achievements of the work and the shortcomings and errors in the work, the hard work of the cadres and the problems that have occurred among the cadres, and we must not underestimate any aspect. Now the people of the whole country are praising our achievements, but at the same time, they are asking us to correct the shortcomings and errors that have already occurred. We should face these shortcomings and errors squarely and correct them. The CPC Central Committee has made a decision to launch criticism and self-criticism, and to rectify and train working cadres. After these steps are taken, we believe that our shortcomings and errors can be corrected."

　　This party-wide rectification movement has a great effect in raising the awareness of the entire party and promoting the work of the entire party. Our party has had two experiences in the past regarding this point. The first was during the difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1942 to 1943. The focus of that rectification was on high- and middle-level leading organs and their staff, and its main target was the dogmatic tendency within the party and the liberal tendency of intellectuals who had newly joined the revolution. The main methods were reading documents and reviewing thoughts. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the achievements of that rectification in December 1947, saying: "The rectification movement within our party during the War of Resistance Against Japan generally achieved results. These results mainly lie in enabling our leading organs and many cadres to further grasp the basic direction of the unity of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. On this point, our party has made a greater step forward than in the previous historical periods before the War of Resistance. However, the problems of impure composition and impure work style existing in the party's local organizations, especially the party's rural grassroots organizations, have not been resolved." The situation mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong here is related to the overall situation in which the party was at that time. The second time was during the tense period of the Liberation War and land reform work from 1947 to 1948. The focus of that rectification was on rural grassroots organizations, and its main target was some landlords and rich peasant elements who had infiltrated the party and some party members who maintained contact with landlords and rich peasants, as well as the phenomenon of many rural cadres being seriously divorced from the masses. The main methods were to invite non-party masses to participate in party meetings through party branches to jointly examine the composition and work style of party members and cadres. That party rectification exposed the phenomenon of impure composition or impure work style existing to some extent within the party, improved the relationship between the party and the masses in rural areas, and helped the progress of land reform work and troop political work. Although left-leaning errors occurred in the work of reviewing cadres in these two rectifications, they were promptly corrected.

　　The current rectification movement is different from the previous two in terms of environment and tasks, and therefore the methods are also different. This rectification is under the conditions of rapid victory throughout the country, and the main task is to correct the commandist work style, strengthen the party's ties with the entire masses of people in urban and rural areas, consolidate the people's democratic united front, so as to facilitate the smooth implementation of land reform work in rural areas in the new liberated areas and the work of adjusting industry and commerce in cities. The basic method of this party rectification is to convene cadre rectification meetings or establish rectification training courses level by level from top to bottom, and in the meetings or training courses, study Comrade Mao Zedong's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and other designated documents, summarize local work, and launch criticism and self-criticism. The focus is on cadres at all levels, because the more responsible the cadres are, the more important the responsibility they bear for the party's work style. The work of rectification meetings or rectification training courses will focus on criticism and self-criticism, and the work of punishing or cleansing the erroneous elements and opportunists discovered in the rectification will be handed over to the regularly responsible organs for handling. This is done to facilitate the division of labor and cooperation and avoid repeating the errors that occurred in the past in the work of reviewing cadres, rather than to reduce the importance that should be attached to the necessary punishment and cleansing work.

　　Improving the party's organizational situation and rectifying the party's work style are two aspects of a general task. This general task is to improve the political quality

　　整顿党的工作作风  改善党的组织状况
    纪念中国共产党成立二十九周年
    中国共产党的成立，到今天已经是二十九个整年了。中国共产党是从二十九年前马克思主义者的小组，成长为有五百多万党员的大党，领导人民取得了有历史意义的伟大胜利，成了中华人民共和国的建立者和领导者了。中国共产党现在面对着的巨大的中心任务，如同毛泽东同志在党的七届三中全会报告所说，就是使从长期战争中诞生的年青的共和国得到经济财政状况的基本好转，而为此目的所必须采取的首要步骤，就是有步骤地进行新解放区的土地改革。为着在胜利以后及时地整理和巩固自己的队伍，加强与广大的人民群众的联系，以便顺利地完成新的任务，中共中央已经决定在全党开展整顿工作作风的运动。为着同样的目的，中共中央同时决定改善党的组织状况，调整党员的成份，提高党员的质量。
    中国共产党的光辉胜利，是和它的正确的工作作风分不开的。什么是中国共产党人的工作作风呢？毛泽东同志在五年以前的党的第七次全国代表大会上说：
    “我们的党从它一开始，就是一个以马克思主义的理论为基础的党，这是因为这个主义是全世界无产阶级的最正确最革命的科学思想的结晶。马克思主义的普遍真理一经和中国革命的具体实践相结合，就使中国革命的面目为之一新，产生了新民主主义的整个历史阶段。在马克思主义的理论思想武装之下的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要地就是理论与实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风与自我批评的作风。”
    当然，我们党的这种工作作风的形成，是一个历史的过程。我们党在二十九年的发展中，曾经有过若干曲折。从根本上说，这些曲折除了由于敌人的强力压迫以外，有许多也还由于党的领导暂时地违背了理论与实践相结合的原则，因而也就减弱了和人民群众的联系。但是由于实行了党内的批评和自我批评，这些领导上的缺点和错误就纠正过来了。自从一九三五年一月成立了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央以来，党中央的领导一贯地是正确的，因而中国革命也表现了稳定的上升。由于以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导的正确和成功，并由于全党大多数党员干部紧密地团结在党中央的领导之下，执行正确的路线和政策，学习正确的工作作风，忠心耿耿，艰苦奋斗，党在人民中间是有了极高的威信。
    如上所说，我们党的工作作风的重要方面之一，就是自我批评的作风。毛泽东同志和党中央经常用自我批评的方法来教育党，以求全党同志不断地改正工作中的缺点和错误，保障党的事业的进步；而党中央所曾经在全党范围内一再领导进行的整风运动的方法，便是一种大规模的自我批评的方法。鉴于过去一年党的工作在巨大的胜利中同时发生了许多缺点和错误特别是命令主义的错误，党中央最近决定举行一次新的整风运动，将这些缺点和错误从根本上加以有系统的改正。刘少奇同志在今年五一纪念会的演说中说：
    “在去年四月二十日人民解放军各路野战军开始向南方和西北进军以来，在极短的时间内，即已解放除西藏外的全部中国大陆包括有三万万以上人口的地区。我们占领的地区是这样大，各项工作极其繁重而复杂，有经验的干部不足，大批的新干部吸收进来，加上没有时间进行整训，因而在工作中伴着伟大成绩而俱来的，就是发生了许多缺点和错误。我们必须全面地看问题；工作的成绩和工作中的缺点错误，干部的艰苦努力和干部中发生的毛病，我们都应当看到，而不可对于任何一方面估计不足。现在全国人民都称赞我们的成绩，但同时要求我们改正已经发生的缺点错误，我们就应当正视这些缺点错误，并加以改正。中共中央已经做出决定，要展开批评和自我批评，并要整训工作干部。在进行了这些步骤以后，我们相信，我们的缺点错误是可以改正过来的。”
    这种全党规模的整风运动在提高全党觉悟，推进全党工作方面，是有伟大作用的，关于这一点，我们党在过去已经有过两次经验。第一次是一九四二年到一九四三年的抗日战争的困难时期，那次整风的重点是在高级中级领导机关及其工作人员，其主要锋芒是对着存在于党内的教条主义倾向和新参加革命的知识分子的自由主义倾向，其主要方法是阅读文件，检讨思想。毛泽东同志在一九四七年十二月总结那次整风的成绩说：“抗日战争时期我党内部的整风运动，是一般地收到了成效的，这种成效，主要地是在于使我们的领导机关及许多干部，进一步地掌握了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践之统一这样一个基本的方向。在这点上，我们党是比抗日以前的几个历史时期大进一步了。但是，在党的地方组织方面，特别是党的农村基层组织方面所存在的成份不纯与作风不纯的问题，则没有获得解决。”毛泽东同志在这里所说的这种情况，是与当时党所处的整个形势相关联的。第二次是在一九四七年到一九四八年的解放战争和土地改革工作的紧张时期，那次整风的重点是在农村基层组织方面，其主要锋芒是对着一些混入党内的地主富农分子和某些与地主富农保持联系的党员，以及许多农村干部严重脱离群众的现象，其主要方法是经过党的支部，邀集党外群众参加党的会议，共同审查党员干部的成份和作风。那次整党，揭发了党内在某种程度上存在着的成份不纯或者作风不纯的现象，改善了农村中党与群众的关系，帮助了土地改革工作和部队政治工作的进展。这两次整风在审查干部的工作中虽曾发生过左的错误，但都已及时地纠正了。
    现在所开始的整风运动，与前两次的环境和任务都不相同，因而方法也不相同。这次整风是在全国得到迅速胜利的条件之下，主要任务是要纠正命令主义作风，加强党和城乡全体人民群众的联系，巩固人民民主统一战线，以便于顺利地进行新区农村中的土地改革工作和城市中的调整工商业工作。这次整党的基本方法是由上而下地逐级召集干部整风会议或成立整风训练班，在会议中或训练班中学习毛泽东同志在中共七届三中全会报告和其他少数指定的文件，总结当地工作，展开批评和自我批评。重点放在各级干部，是因为愈是负责的干部对于党的工作作风也就要负愈重要的责任。整风会议或整风训练班的工作，将以批评和自我批评为主，而处分或清洗在整风中所发现的犯错误分子和投机分子的工作，则将移交经常负责的机关来处理。这样做，是为了便于分工合作和避免重犯过去审查干部工作中所曾发生过的错误，而不是为了降低必要的处分清洗工作所应当引起的重视。
    改善党的组织状况，和整顿党的工作作风，是一个总任务的两个方面。这个总任务就是提高党的政治质量，以利于巩固与人民群众的团结。
    中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，但是从党员的社会出身来看，却以农民出身的成份占了大多数。这种情况，是中国社会条件特别是中国革命发展的特殊历史条件所决定的。这当然不能够而事实上也没有妨害我们党的阶级性质。刘少奇同志在论党一书中说得好：“仅仅是党员的社会出身，还不能决定一切。决定的东西，是我们党的政治斗争与政治生活，是我们党的思想教育、思想领导与政治领导，而我们党的总纲及党的组织原则，则保障了无产阶级的思想和路线在党内占居统治地位。”此外，就从成份的观点来看，我们也必须注意两个事实：第一，如果把工人、雇农、贫农、城市贫民四种无产者和半无产者成份合计，那么，按去年年终统计，在我们党的三百二十六万多地方党员中，这些成份即合占百分之六十二。第二，我们党约有一百万党员，在长期的战争和革命生活中受供给制待遇，也就是过着严格的军事共产主义生活，这些党员从觉悟程度和生活方法来看都应当说是工人阶级中的最优秀部分。
    但是这决不是说，我们党可以满足于目前的这种在过去历史条件限制下发展起来的党的组织状况。从去年三月党的七届二中全会以来，党已经着重地注意了吸收工人入党。例如北京去年一年增加的三千三百五十个新党员中，工人成份占百分之五十强，天津去年最后四个月增加的六千六百四十八个新党员中，工人成份占百分之七十三。党中央希望在三年到五年内有步骤地吸收三分之一的产业工人在有充分革命觉悟的条件下入党，而在另一方面，决定一般地停止在老解放区农村中吸收党员，在新解放区农村中也不在土地改革完成以前发展党的组织。
    中国共产党现在在组织上已经是世界第二个大的工人阶级政党。中国共产党的发展状况是随着不同的历史条件而变化的：在一九二四年至一九二七年的第一次国内革命战争（北伐战争）时期，党曾发展到五万九千余人。这次革命的失败使党员降至一万人左右。在第二次国内革命战争（土地革命战争）的一九三四年，党又发展到三十万人，但同年战争受挫，党员人数又下降，到一九三七年抗日战争开始时只有四万人左右。抗日战争以后，党的组织不断发展，在一九四五年抗日战争胜利时，党已经发展到一百二十一万人。在现有的五百多万党员中，除部队党员占一百二十万人外，华北、华东、东北三区约共占三百四十万人，这是因为这三区的大部属于老解放区的原故。但是就在这三区中，新党员也占很大的数目。去年一年中入党的新党员，在全国有一百四十万人之多；在这样大量的新党员中，不可避免地要包含许多不合党员条件的分子，以至一些投机分子。而这是不应该有的。为了提高党员的政治质量，今后党员入党的条件必须适当地提高。
    中国共产党现在不但需要调整党员的社会成份，而且需要用极大的力量对大量的新党员进行党的教育，并对那些已经混入党内的投机分子，和那些毛病很大，经过教育仍然不愿改正的党员，采取妥善的方法加以洗刷，或令其退党。
    只有这样，只有完成了改善党的组织状况的任务和整顿党的工作作风的任务，我们的党才能够更有效地团结全体人民群众，执行党的七届三中全会和人民政协第二次全国委员会的决议，顺利地争取国家经济财政状况的基本好转，顺利地进行和完成新解放区的土地改革工作，并顺利地战胜美帝国主义的干涉而解放台湾和中国的一切领土。毫无疑问，我们必须完成这样的任务，我们也一定能够完成这样的任务。
