　　Rongcheng, Shandong Strengthens Leadership of People's Schools; Most Suspended People's Schools Recover

    [Our dispatch] This spring, the permanent people's schools in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, which were transformed from winter schools, were mostly suspended after the spring plowing began. After strong rectification by the leadership, 528 people's school classes, 651 literacy groups, 71 reading groups, and 147 communication groups have now been restored, with a total of 22,819 people participating in the study, about one-third of the number of students in winter schools last year. According to the inspection by the county government's Culture and Education Section, the reasons for the collapse of most of the people's schools during spring plowing are: first, the district and village culture and education committees did not tightly grasp the leadership of the people's school work, and did not make regular arrangements, inspections, and summaries, so that the people's schools did not receive help from the leadership, forming a laissez-faire situation. For example, the Chengshan District Culture and Education Committee had not held a meeting for more than a month. Each member was stationed in a certain village to carry out central work, without contacting each other, and turned a blind eye to the work of the people's schools. At the same time, since the district culture and education assistants were revoked in January and concentrated in the county, some district leaders did not pay enough attention to the work of the people's schools, and no one was specifically responsible. The village culture and education committees, because the district culture committees did not grasp tightly, the members were busy with production and did not care about the people's schools. Second, the county and district leaders only valued primary school education and neglected social education. Third, the teachers of the people's schools were busy with production, and the village did not give them appropriate care, so their enthusiasm was not high. Some village cadres thought, "I work all year round, and no one takes care of me. Do I still need to take care of the teachers of the people's schools?" This problem could not be solved. Fourth, the combination of learning and central work such as production was not enough. The masses felt that going to the people's schools delayed production, so they did not go to school.
    On May 6, the county held a meeting of culture and education assistants, corrected the cadres' thinking of neglecting the work of the people's schools, and discussed the methods of rectifying and restoring the people's schools. After the meeting, the culture and education assistants went to the districts separately. First, they obtained the consent of the district leaders. The culture and education assistants did not stay in one place to do central work, but combined departmental business work with central work. Subsequently, district and village culture and education cadre meetings were held separately to arrange and discuss the principles and steps for carrying out social education work. Clear division of labor, establishment of work and meeting system. Fengshan, Houshan and other districts arranged and discussed the development of social education work separately at the village head meetings, the village's party and league branch secretary meetings, women's congress meetings, and teacher meetings. Other districts generally held village culture committee meetings, people's school teacher meetings, and primary school teacher meetings to arrange separately. After such multi-faceted arrangements, most of the villages in the county have restored or established learning organizations.
    The study time in the people's schools has also been adjusted. Women generally study for one and a half to two hours during the lunch break; men's classes are scheduled to study on the evenings of the third, sixth, and ninth days or the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth days. The content of education is mainly literacy; and in combination with the needs of the masses, production self-rescue and other policy education and the removal of wheatgrass, prevention of diseases and insect pests, fertilizer accumulation, health and epidemic prevention and other production and health common sense education. Some began to take care of the production difficulties of the people's school teachers. Primary school teachers also helped the people's school teachers in teaching, and some also taught singing, current affairs, and health common sense in the people's schools. The enthusiasm of most of the existing 658 people's school teachers in the county has been improved.

　　山东荣城加强民校领导
    停顿民校大部恢复
    【本报讯】山东荣城县今春由冬学转设的常年民校，春耕开始后大部分陷于停顿。经过领导上的大力整顿，现在恢复了民校五百二十八班，识字组六百五十一组，读报组七十一组，通讯组一百四十七组，共有二万二千八百十九人参加学习，约为去年冬学学员人数的三分之一。据县府文教科检查，春耕中各地民校大部垮台的原因，第一是区、村文教委员会对民校工作的领导抓得不紧，没有定时的布置、检查和总结，使民校得不到领导上的帮助，形成自流。如成山区区文教委员会一个多月没有开过会，各委员都分头常驻一定的村庄搞中心工作，互不联系，对民校工作不闻不问。同时，自一月份各区撤销文教助理员而集中到县后，有些区的领导干部对民校工作重视不够，没有专人负责。各村的文教委员会，也因区文委会抓得不紧，委员们都忙着生产，不管民校了。第二，县区的领导上也只重视小学教育，忽视社会教育。第三，民校教师忙于生产，村里没有给以适当的照顾，情绪不高。有的村干部认为“自己一年到头做工作，没有人照顾，民校教师还用得照顾吗？”使这一问题不能解决。第四，学习与生产等中心工作的结合不够，群众感到上民校耽误生产，也不去上学了。
    五月六日，该县召开了文教助理员会议，纠正了干部忽视民校工作的思想，讨论了整顿、恢复民校的办法。会后文教助理员分头下区，首先商得区领导上的同意，文教助理员不老蹲在一点光干中心工作，而是把部门业务工作与中心工作结合进行。随后各地分别召开了区、村文教干部会议，布置、讨论了开展社教工作的方针与步骤。明确分工，建立工作、会议制度。风山、后山等区，把开展社教工作在村长会上，在村的党、团支书会上、妇代会上，教员会上，分头布置讨论。其他各区都普遍召开了村文委会、民校教师会、小学教师会，分头布置。经过这样多方面的布置，全县大部村子都恢复或建立了学习组织。
    民校里的学习时间也作了调整。妇女一般在午饭后歇晌时间学习一小时半至二小时；男班则规定在三、六、九日或二、四、六、八、十日的晚上学习。教育内容主要是识字；并结合群众的需要，进行生产自救等政策教育和拔除乌麦、防除病虫害、积肥、卫生防疫等生产、卫生常识教育。有的开始照顾民校教师生产上的困难。小学教师也做到了在教学上帮助民校教师，有的还担任民校的唱歌、时事、卫生常识等课。全县现有的六百五十八个民校教师的工作情绪大部分提高了。
