Editor's Note: On May 17th, this newspaper published a news article by our special correspondent Lin Wei entitled "Serious Damage to Qinling Forest Area." On May 24th, we published readers Hua Shi, Jin Ming, and Chen Nianci's opinions on the damage to the Qinling forest area. Recently, we received a reply from the Chang'an County People's Government in Shaanxi Province, which reviewed the issue and offered opinions on Lin Wei's report. Comrade Lin Wei also provided an explanation and self-criticism regarding his report.

Chang'an County People's Government's Reply
To the Editors:

Regarding the serious damage to the Nan Wutai scenic forest area in our county reported in the People's Daily on May 17th, and the request from readers Hua Shi, et al., in the "People's Garden" on May 24th for a thorough self-criticism, we believe this is appropriate. We are now sending you the results of our investigation and our self-criticism.

Due to the existence of empiricism in the county's leadership and insufficient understanding of the cause of economic construction in New China, the three notices from the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government's Department of Agriculture regarding forest protection work, and the two official letters from the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture regarding forest protection, were not given due attention since October of last year. They were merely routinely forwarded to the relevant districts and townships. In particular, after receiving the letter from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry instructing us to send cadres to personally mobilize and arrange forest protection, we still did not become seriously vigilant and simply ordered the districts and townships to handle the matter. Although we received several reports from these districts and townships, we did not promptly report them to higher authorities. It was not until mid-April to late May that we wrote three reports. The time delay was long, and the number of reports was small. We neither personally went down to supervise and inspect the forest protection work in the districts and townships, nor did we seriously study the various situations reflected by the districts and townships, investigate and understand the problems existing in the forest protection work, or earnestly help guide the districts and townships in doing this work well. This is a manifestation of the county's leadership being irresponsible and undisciplined, unorganized, and bureaucratic towards the people's property and instructions from higher levels. We sincerely accept the criticism from the People's Daily and readers Hua Shi, et al.

The Truth about the Damage to the Nan Wutai Scenic Forest Area

(1) The Nan Wutai forest area, approximately 40 li from north to south and 20 li from east to west, is indeed a scenic area in the Qinling Mountains directly south of Xi'an. When mobilizing for the purchase of railway sleepers last October, the county government, due to the urgency of the task and the proximity of Wangqu and its surrounding areas to the southern mountains for easy procurement, allocated a larger number to the area. As a result, at that time, the masses in the first and third townships of the area did not comply with the principle of "not damaging the trees in the already designated scenic forest area" and went into the mountains to cut down some trees to make up for the shortfall. The two townships cut down a total of more than 200 trees. This caused disputes at the time, which were later resolved by the two townships holding township peasant representative meetings and formulating forest protection agreements. Later, due to our troops stationed in the southern mountains entering the mountains to cut down trees, the peasant association masses' attempts to stop them were ineffective, and some backward masses took the opportunity to enter the mountains to cut down trees as well. Although our troops stopped cutting down trees afterward, the masses continued to cut down trees. The village and peasant association cadres and comrades of the troops in the area then worked together to protect the forests, but initially, it was ineffective. Around January this year, the Wangqu District Office, the cadres of the third township, the third township peasant association, and the security group, together with 30 to 50 militiamen from the first township, carried guns and searched the mountains several times, patrolled the mountain passes at night, and held three mass meetings specifically for forest protection. They also educated those who cut down trees, but the effect was always small. It was not until mid-April that the Wangqu District Office, with the consent of the county government, arrested the three principal culprits who cut down trees, sent them to the county for detention, and mobilized house-by-house searches for the cut timber, which basically stopped the destructive behavior of these backward masses.

(2) In addition to the organized purchase of railway sleepers by the masses in the first and third townships, cutting down more than 200 trees, and the organized cutting down of some trees by the troops (estimated at no more than several hundred trees), the remaining damage to the forest area was mainly caused by groups of backward masses, numbering ten, eight, thirty, or twenty people, sneaking into the mountains to cut down trees. During the most serious period of destruction in February and March of this year, the maximum number of people on certain days was about 100. It was not the government that organized the masses to enter the mountains to cut down trees for production and disaster relief. Our county did indeed arrange winter sideline production last winter and specifically sent county cadres to assist the district and township leaders in leading the masses into the mountains for production. However, our plan was to enter the mountains to cut firewood, carry charcoal, and sell mountain goods. There was no organization to cut down trees. In reality, at that time, the peasant association cadres leading the masses into the mountains for production did not cut down trees. The county and district leadership at the time had no intention of using large-scale deforestation as a means of disaster relief. However, during the serious stage of forest area damage (according to our investigation with the masses and cadres at the southern mountain pass, the forest area lost nearly 10,000 trees of various sizes during this period), we did not personally arrange inspections or take effective measures, causing undue losses to state property. This is our serious mistake, and we should bear considerable responsibility.

(3) The so-called behavior of first "plucking large hairs" and then "shaving the head bald" is not entirely accurate. When the destructive behavior of some of the masses became serious, the local district, township, village, and peasant associations actively patrolled the mountains and the mountain passes to stop them. Although some unscrupulous elements continued to steal, it cannot be said that no one cared, let alone that the government intentionally allowed the masses to do this. Furthermore, the so-called stealing of at least 50,000 trees since New Year's Day is, according to our investigation, an exaggeration. If we make a realistic calculation based on the number of people who could possibly enter the mountains to steal wood each day and the time involved, we will find that the so-called "50,000 trees" figure has little basis. The agriculture and forestry cadres twice asked us for forest protection official letters and notices. The first time, when the clerk was preparing to take them out, they didn't look at them. The second time, when the comrades from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry came to see them, we took out all the documents in person. Therefore, the claim that even the notices could not be found is also inconsistent with the facts. In addition, regarding the claim that large-scale destruction was temporarily stopped only after the Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent two cadres to the site on April 7th, the two comrades from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry did go to Nan Wutai, but at that time, they only established the Qinling Management Station and learned about the situation (of course, they also reflected some of the actual situation to higher levels). They did not discuss and cooperate with the local village administrative and peasant associations to effectively stop the destruction. In reality, the cessation of large-scale destruction was mainly due to the concerted action of the village and peasant associations in the area, the majority of the masses who were concerned about the forest area, and the search of households for stolen timber and the arrest of the principal culprits (three people), which had an effect. In short, the county government did fail to fulfill its due responsibility for this issue, but the district and villages' spirit of conscientiousness and responsibility in this work cannot be ignored.

Two Opinions on this Issue

(1) Ran Shengwen, the forest police officer in Nan Wutai, was a forest police officer during the enemy and puppet regime. According to reflections from the local masses and our understanding, this person has consistently smoked "white powder" and has often colluded with some backward masses and timber merchants inside and outside the mountains to privately cut and sell timber in the past. He has also had connections with individual timber thieves in Wangqu Township. Therefore, since liberation, he has been lenient towards the timber thieves in the first township and strict towards the timber thieves in the third township, intentionally provoking the relationship between the masses in the two townships and creating disputes to conceal his destructive behavior. In his previous reports to the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, in order to conceal his own evil deeds, he exaggerated the reports to higher levels. We request that the Department of Agriculture and Forestry provide him with good education.

(2) We feel that the reporting spirit of your newspaper's special correspondent Lin Wei is very correct. However, we wonder whether the materials in his report are based on personal investigation or on the study and analysis of the reports given to the Department of Agriculture and Forestry by Ran Shengwen and others. If it is not based on personal investigation or obtained through research and analysis, but only on the basis of this material, some of which exaggerates and fabricates facts, this is somewhat contrary to the meaning of the People's Daily being realistic and striving for authenticity.

Self-Criticism of Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Lin Wei

The source of the news material regarding the damage to the Qinling forest area was actively collected by several comrades from the Forestry Bureau and the director of the Qinling Forest Farm, and they told me about the experiences of the comrades sent to Xiaolongshan and Nan Wutai for inspection work. After writing it, I asked Director Fan of the Forestry Bureau to personally correct the facts, and he helped me supplement the materials.

After reviewing myself, subjectively, I certainly had no intention of sensationalizing or criticizing for the sake of criticism. Because I knew very well that the local comrades were busy (this point was mentioned in the report). However, my work style has shortcomings, that is, I excessively trusted indirect materials and did not go to Chang'an County or Xiaolongshan and other places to see for myself. Therefore, I cannot answer some of the questions raised by the Chang'an County government myself and can only let the Northwest Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Forestry Bureau investigate. I will strive to correct this superficial reporting style in the future.

　　秦岭林区遭严重破坏事件
    陕西长安县来信答复及本报记者林韦同志的检讨
    编者按：五月十七日本报发表了特派记者林韦同志所写的“秦岭林区遭严重破坏”新闻，五月二十四日又刊载了读者华实、金铭、陈念慈对秦岭林区遭破坏的意见。日前接到陕西长安县人民政府的复信，对此问题做了检讨，并对林韦同志的报道提出了意见，林韦同志对他所写的报道也作了说明与检讨。
        长安县人民政府的答复编者同志：
    五月十七日人民日报载我县南五台风景林区遭严重破坏事，二十四日读者华实等在“人民园地”上要求我们进行彻底检讨。我们认为是应该的。现将我们调查的真象及检讨寄上。
    由于县领导上存在经验主义，对新中国经济建设事业的认识不够，所以从去年十月份以来，前陕甘宁边区政府农业厅关于有关护林工作的三次通知，及西北军政委员会农林部与陕西省农业厅两次有关护林的公函，未予重视，仅仅照例行文命令该区乡办理。尤其在接到农林部函令我们派干部亲自动员布置护林事后，仍未引起严重警惕，照样命令区乡办理。虽曾先后接到该区乡数次报告，但未及时向上级反映。直至四月中旬到五月下旬才先后写了报告三次。时间拖延的既长，而报告的次数也少。我们对区乡的护林工作，既未亲自下去督促检查，又未认真的研究区乡历次反映的情况，调查了解掌握护林工作中存在的一些问题，认真帮助指导区乡做好这一工作。这是县领导上对人民财产和上级指示不负责任和无纪律无组织官僚主义的表现。我们诚恳接受人民日报和读者华实等对我们的批评。
    南五台风景林区破坏真象
    （一）南五台林区，南北约四十华里，东西约二十华里，确为西安正南秦岭一风景区。去年十月动员代购枕木时，县府以任务紧急，王曲一带又靠南山便于采购，给该区分配数目较多，因之当时该区一、三两乡群众未遵照在“不损害已经划定的风景林区树木”的原则下，进山砍伐一部补充不足。计两乡共伐树二百余株。当时曾引起纠纷，后经两乡召开乡农民代表会处理，并订出护林公约，求得了适当的解决。以后因我驻南山部队进山砍伐树木，农会群众阻止无效，一些落后群众遂也乘机进山砍伐。以后我部队虽停止了砍伐，而群众则仍继续砍伐。该区乡村农会干部及部队同志遂协同防护，但开始时仍无效果。今年一月前后，王曲区及三乡干部与三乡农会及治安小组，协同一乡自卫军三十人、五十人曾数度携带枪支武装入山搜查，夜晚在山口一带巡逻放哨，并曾专为护林开过三次群众大会，也曾对砍伐者进行了教育，但总是效果不大。直至四月中旬，王曲区署商得县府同意，逮捕了砍伐者主犯三人，送县管押，并动员逐户搜查砍伐之木料，基本上停止了这些落后群众的破坏行为。
    （二）破坏林区的行为除一、三乡群众有组织的采购枕木砍伐二百余株及部队同志有组织的砍伐一部（估计不过数百株）外，其余均是一些落后群众十人、八人、三十人、二十人，成群结伙的偷入山中砍伐。在今年破坏最严重时期的二、三月间的某些日子，最多的人数约百人左右。并非政府为了生产救灾而号召有组织的进山砍伐。我们县上去年冬季确实布置过冬季副业生产，也曾专门派县里干部下去协同区乡领导群众进山生产。但我们的计划上是进山砍柴背木炭、贩山货，并没有组织砍伐树木。而实际情况，当时农会干部带领群众进山生产，也并未砍伐过树木。在当时县区的领导思想上也根本没有以大规模的砍伐森林手段当作救灾的办法。但是在破坏林区严重阶段（据我们与南山口群众干部调查，林区在这一时期前后损失大小树约近一万株），我们没有亲自布置检查、采取有效措施，使国家财产遭受不应有的损失。这是我们的严重错误，我们应负相当的责任。
    （三）所谓先“拔大毛”后“剃光头”的行为，不完全确实。当部分群众的破坏行为严重时，当地区乡政府、村及农会即积极入山和在山口巡查制止。虽部分不肖分子继续进行偷窃，但不能说无人过问，更非政府有意让群众这样去搞。又所谓元旦以来被窃树木至少在五万株以上。据我们调查，这个数目字是夸大的。如果我们根据每天可能进山偷伐的群众人数和时间作一个接近实际的计算，就会发现所谓“五万株”这一数目是很少有根据的。农林干部同志曾有两次向我们要过护林公函和通知，第一次科员准备取时，他们不看了；第二次农林厅同志来要看，我们当面拿出全部文件。因此所谓连通知都找不到，也是不符合事实的。另外关于直至农林部专派干部二人，于四月七日赶赴现场，才暂时制止了大规模的破坏。农林部二同志确实去过南五台，但他们当时所作的仅仅是建立秦岭管理站，了解情况（当然也给上级反映了些实际情况），他们根本未与当地区乡村行政与农会商谈配合进行有效制止。实际停止大规模的破坏，主要是该地区乡村及农会，与大多数关心林区的群众一致行动和按户搜查被盗树木、逮捕首要分子（三人）所收到的效果。总之，县府对这一问题确实没有尽到应有责任，但区乡村在这一工作中的认真负责的精神，是不能抹煞的。
    对这一问题的两点意见
    （一）南五台林警冉生文，系敌伪时期的林警。据当地群众反映和我们了解，该人一贯吸食“白面”，在过去经常勾结山内外的一些落后群众和木商私伐贩卖木材。并与我王曲一乡的个别偷林分子素有勾结。因之，解放以来，对一乡的偷林者放松，而对三乡的偷林者管得严。有意挑拨该两乡的群众关系，制造纠纷，隐蔽他的破坏行为。他历次给农林部的报告中，为了掩饰他本身的恶迹，向上夸大报告。我们要求农林部予以很好的教育。
    （二）贵报特派记者林韦同志的报道精神，我们觉得是很对的。但他的报道的材料是否系根据亲身调查，或就冉生文等给农林部的报告加以研究分析过的。如果不是亲身调查，或经研究分析得来的，而仅凭这个有些是夸大捏造事实的材料，这对人民报纸实事求是力求真实性的意义就有些违背了。
                                长安县人民政府  六月十一日
    本报特派记者林韦的检讨
    关于秦岭林区遭破坏的新闻材料来源，是由林业局几位同志及秦岭林场场长积极帮我搜集的，并将派赴小陇山及南五台检查工作的同志的见闻都告诉我。写了以后，曾经让林业局范局长亲自校正事实，他又帮我补充了材料。
    我自己检讨了一下，主观上确无危言耸听，为批评而批评的意思。因为我很知道地方同志是忙碌的（报道中曾提及此点）。但我的工作作风有缺点，就是过分相信了间接材料，自己没有到长安县或小陇山等地去看看。所以长安县府提出的一些问题，我自己并不能答复，只能由西北农林部林业局来考察了。我以后当努力改正这种不深入的报道作风。
