　　On Agricultural Mechanization Schools
　　Answers to Readers' Questions

Dear Reader:
　　Recently, we have received many letters from various places inquiring about the enrollment situation of the Central People's Government Agricultural Mechanization School. The school's response is as follows:
　　The students of the mechanization school are mainly comrades from various organs of the Central People's Government sent by their respective organizations and soldiers selected and transferred from the People's Liberation Army. The purpose is to cultivate cadres who master new production technologies. Based on the actual needs of state-owned farms in various regions, it has been decided not to enroll students this year. Future enrollment information will be announced in the press.
　　The school mainly recruits young workers and peasants aged 18 to 28 to improve their cultural level and learn mechanization techniques. Because mechanization work is relatively heavy, the first requirement for admission is a strong physique and a strong labor concept and habit. The cultural level generally requires junior high school graduation (but this is not required for young workers and peasants, revolutionary heroes, and labor heroes).
　　Also, many organs from various places come to our school to visit various agricultural machinery. However, now that the rainy season has arrived and the school's machinery exhibition hall has not yet been repaired, most of the machines have been stored in warehouses. Therefore, visits will be suspended from today.

　　关于农业机耕学校
    答读者问读者同志：
    近接各地询问中央人民政府农业机耕学校招生情况的信很多。现经该校答复如下：
    机耕学校学生主要系中央人民政府各机关保送之原机关工作同志及由解放军中选调的战士，宗旨在培养掌握新式生产技术的干部。根据各地国营农场实际需要情况，决定今年不再招生；以后招生当在报端公布。
    学校主要是招收十八至二十八岁的工农青年，以提高他们的文化程度，学会机耕技术。因机耕工作较为繁重，故在入学条件中首先是要有强壮的体格和坚强的劳动观念和习惯，文化程度一般需初中毕业（但工农革命青年，劳动英雄不限）。
    又平日各地机关前来我校参观各种农业机械者很多，现在因已到雨季，及学校机械展览场尚未修好，大部机器已入库保存，故即日起停止参观。
                                                  编者
