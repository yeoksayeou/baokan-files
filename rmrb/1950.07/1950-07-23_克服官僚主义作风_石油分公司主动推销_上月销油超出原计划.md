　　Overcoming Bureaucratic Work Style
    Petroleum Branch Company Actively Promotes Sales
    Last Month's Oil Sales Exceeded the Original Plan
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Petroleum Branch Company has overcome bureaucratism and commercialized operations, adopting an active sales promotion policy. In June, kerosene sales exceeded the original plan by 61.79%, and gasoline sales reached 97.65% of the original plan. In the first ten days of July, kerosene sales accounted for 58.43% of the monthly plan, and gasoline accounted for 59.7%.
    Since its establishment in mid-April, the company's business model has been to wait for customers to come to them, without paying attention to promotional work. Their attitude towards customers was neither amiable nor did they provide procedural convenience, resulting in only half of the sales plan being completed in May. At the end of May, the company summarized the above shortcomings, educated cadres to overcome and correct them, and changed their work style. In early June, the company sent cadres to various public and private enterprises to investigate oil demand and established business relationships with some units. At the same time, it organized cadres to go to the countryside and work with cooperatives, enabling a large amount of kerosene to be sold in rural areas. Since the company adopted an active sales promotion policy, its business has developed significantly.

　　克服官僚主义作风
    石油分公司主动推销           
    上月销油超出原计划
    【本报讯】京石油分公司克服商业机关化及官僚主义作风，采取主动推销营业方针，六月全月销出煤油超出原计划百分之六十一点七九，销出汽油占原计划的百分之九十七点六五。七月上旬煤油销出量占全月计划的百分之五十八点四三，汽油占百分之五十九点七。
    该公司于四月中旬成立后，营业方式一直是等待主顾上门，向不注意宣传工作，对顾客的态度既欠和蔼，也未能处处予以手续上的便利，致五月份推销计划只完成了二分之一。五月末，该公司总结出上述缺点，并教育干部克服纠正，转变作风。六月初，公司派遣干部至各公私企业部门，调查需油情况，并与部分单位建立了业务关系。同时，组织干部下乡与合作社结合，使大量煤油销入农村。该公司自采取了主动推销营业方针后，业务即显著开展。
