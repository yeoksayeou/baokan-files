　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: Private industry and commerce in Chongqing, which were paralyzed at the beginning of the liberation, have begun to recover after half a year of active support from the People's Government and state-owned enterprises. About 90% of the yarn spindles in the city's eleven private machine cotton textile industries have resumed production. All twenty-six shipping companies with a total tonnage of over 37,500 tons (96% of which are private) were completely shut down before liberation, but most have now resumed operations. Ten private coal mines have also resumed production. Nearly 30 of the more than 170 private iron and steel machinery factories that had ceased operations in the six months before the liberation of Chongqing have resumed work or partially resumed work. Among them, the larger Yuxin Steel Plant resumed full operation in March. Other industries such as rubber, electrical equipment, papermaking, cement, leather, glass, and bristles have also been restored to varying degrees with state support. According to materials from the Southwest Trade Department: over the past six months, more than 400 large and small factories on the verge of shutdown have been able to continue operations due to the efforts of various specialized companies in purchasing finished products.
    At the beginning of the liberation of Chongqing, private industry and commerce were in a state of complete paralysis, with a general shortage of funds, lack of raw materials, and sluggish sales. In addition, industrialists and businessmen did not understand the policies of the People's Government, and labor-capital relations were abnormal, which further increased the difficulties. Over the past six months, the People's Government and state-owned enterprises have provided strong support to private industry and commerce through various means such as purchasing, ordering, commissioned processing, loans, and price adjustments; and to this end, more than ten professional meetings have been held in six industries. The Southwest Trade Department and its affiliated specialized companies have invested 128.4 billion yuan in purchasing various goods from private manufacturers. For example, the native products company purchased materials such as bristles and sheepskins, releasing 36.2 billion yuan in cash, enabling more than 80 bristle washing factories that had been completely shut down before liberation to resume operations. The department stores purchased paper worth 430 million yuan from paper mills such as Puquan, Tongliang, Zhongfu, Tianyuan, and Zhongyuan. In order to support the private steel industry, the Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau entrusted private factories to manufacture more than 500 tons of materials needed for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The Southwest Highway Bureau allocated a portion of the steel bridge materials required for the construction of the Sichuan-Kangding Highway to private machinery industries for customization, and the Southwest Industrial Department purchased a total of 300 tons of white pig iron and gray pig iron from private steel plants. The Southwest Industrial Department purchased coal from eleven private coal mines such as Dashengcheng, Gongbaoyuan, and Fuxinglong, worth a total of 6.757 billion yuan. The Southwest Trade Department stored 16,000 tons of coal needed by various private shipping companies during the flood season, helping to solve the financial difficulties of the shipping industry and helping the coal industry solve sales difficulties. The Southwest Industrial Supply and Marketing Company ordered five months' worth of coal from the coal mining industry on behalf of various public factories. In addition, the large number of orders from the troops also played a significant role in the recovery of private industry.
    In terms of loan support, the Chongqing branch of the People's Bank of China lent more than 90% of the 47.4 billion yuan it lent from its opening to the end of May to private industry and commerce. These loans played a role in the recovery of private industry and commerce. For example, loans of 4.4 billion yuan to the shipping industry not only benefited the restoration of transportation and the exchange of materials, but also expanded the market for industries such as coal.
    In terms of price adjustments, cotton yarn fell the most during the general price decline in March and April. Compared with February 21, the price on April 15 fell by about 56.16%, while the price of rice fell by only 35.44% during the same period, forming a reverse scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products, hindering the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and hitting industrial production. In order to prevent the excessive decline in yarn prices, the yarn and cloth company purchased 1,000 pieces of yarn from April 24 to May 18, raising the price of yarn from 4.1 million yuan per piece in early May to more than 5 million yuan. At the same time, the grain company supplied a large amount of rice to the market, suppressing grain prices, so that the price of medium-grade cooked rice per hundred catties dropped from 108,200 yuan in early June to 92,400 yuan on the 15th, making the ratio of industrial and agricultural products more normal.
    Chongqing's private industry and commerce are only beginning to recover. In order to achieve improvement and fundamentally overcome difficulties, much effort is still needed. First of all, management must be improved to reduce costs. The cost of various raw materials in the Southwest is higher than in major cities across the country such as Shanghai and Tianjin. Secondly, industries with overcapacity, such as cigarettes, flour, rice milling, alcohol, and soap, need to be adjusted appropriately. In addition, it is necessary to gradually overcome the blindness in production. At present, in addition to the government having begun to rationally adjust industry and commerce under the principle of overall planning, industries such as knitting and leather making have begun to organize joint ventures to uniformly accept orders, so that production can be carried out in a more planned manner.

　　政府大力扶助改变瘫痪状态
    渝私营工商业开始恢复
    【本报讯】据新华社重庆讯：重庆市解放之初已呈瘫痪状态的私营工商业，在人民政府及国营企业半年来的积极扶助下，已开始恢复。全市十一家私营机器棉纺织业已有约百分之九十以上的纱锭恢复了生产。拥有三万七千五百余吨位的二十六家轮船公司（其中私营占百分之九十六）解放前陷于全部停顿，现已大部复航。十家私营煤矿也已恢复了生产。在重庆解放前半年即陷于停工的一百七十余家私营钢铁机器厂已有近三十家复工或部分复工。其中规模较大的渝鑫钢铁厂，已于三月全部复工。其他如橡胶、电工器材、造纸、水泥、制革、玻璃、制鬃等行业，也均在国家扶助下，得到了不同程度的恢复。据西南贸易部材料：半年来濒于停工状态的大小厂家，经各专业公司努力收购成品而能继续开工生产者，已达四百余家。
    重庆解放之初，私营工商业完全处在瘫痪状态中，资金短绌、原料缺乏、销路呆滞成为普遍的困难。再加上工商业家对人民政府政策不了解，劳资关系不正常，更增加了困难。半年来人民政府及国营企业通过收购、订货、委托加工、贷款、调整价格等各种方式，对私营工商业进行了大力扶助；并为此曾召开了六个行业的十余次专业会议。西南贸易部所属各专业公司，在收购私营厂商各种货品中所投放的资金，已达一千二百八十四亿元。其中如土产公司收购猪鬃、羊皮等物资，放出现金三百六十二亿元，使解放前全部停工的洗鬃厂恢复达八十余家。百货公司向溥泉、铜梁、中孚、天原、中元等造纸厂收购的纸张，价值四亿三千余万元。为扶持私营钢铁业，重庆铁路工程局将修建成渝铁路所需料具交私营厂制作者共五百余吨。西南公路局则将修建川康公路所需钢桥器材分配一部向私营机器业定制，西南工业部并向私营钢铁厂收购白口铁、灰口铁共三百吨。西南工业部向大生成、公宝源、复兴隆等十一家私营煤矿收购煤炭共值六十七亿五千七百万元。西南贸易部替各私营轮船公司储存洪水期所需煤斤一万六千吨，一面帮助解决航运业的资金困难，一面亦帮助煤业解决销路困难。西南工业供销公司则代各公营工厂向煤矿业订了五个月的煤斤。此外，部队的大批定货，对于私营工业的恢复，也起了不小作用。
    在贷款扶助方面，人民银行重庆分行从开业到五月底，贷出的四百七十四亿元中，百分之九十以上是贷给私营工商业的。这些贷款对于私营工商业的恢复起了作用。如对航运业贷款四十四亿，不仅对恢复交通和交流物资有好处，而且为煤炭等业扩大了市场。
    在调整价格方面，三四月物价普遍下跌中，棉纱下跌幅度最大。四月十五日与二月二十一日相比下跌约百分之五十六点一六，而米粮在同一时期仅跌百分之三十五点四四，形成工农业品间的反剪刀差额，阻碍了城乡物资的交流，打击了工业生产。为了阻止纱价的过分下跌，花纱布公司在四月二十四日至五月十八日购进了一千件纱，将五月初每件跌至四百一十万元的纱价提到五百万元以上。同时粮食公司以大批食米供应市场，压低粮价，使中河熟米每百斤由六月初的十万八千二百元降到十五日的九万二千四百元，使工农业品的比价趋向正常。
    重庆市私营工商业目前仅是开始恢复，为了争取好转，从根本上克服困难，还需要作很大的努力。首先必须改善经营以减低成本。西南各种生产品成本之高较全国各大城市如上海、天津等地为甚。其次，对生产已经过剩的行业，如卷烟、面粉、碾米、酒精、肥皂等业，则需作适当的调整。此外，并需逐步克服生产中的盲目性。目前除政府已在统筹兼顾原则下开始合理地调整工商业外，针织、制革等业已开始组织联营机构统一接受订货，以便比较有计划地进行生产。
