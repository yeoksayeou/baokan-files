        Lüda Wheat Bumper Harvest
    The 130,000 mu of wheat in the Lüda area have generally yielded a bumper harvest, except for a few individual areas. The average yield per mu is nearly five dou, more than one and a half times the average yield of less than two dou last year. The wheat of labor hero Zhao Zhensheng averaged more than eight dou per mu. At the same time, summer stubble (second season crops) are being rushed into planting. During the harvesting, farmers are all paying attention to selecting wheat seeds from the ears. For example, in Xiaoxinzhaizi, Gezhenbao District, Dalian County, superior varieties have been generally selected from the ears for promotion next year.
            Jixi County Government in Southern Anhui Leads the Masses in Overcoming the Summer Famine
    Jixi County in southern Anhui suffered a poor harvest last year, and coupled with the uneven cold and hot weather this spring, some areas also suffered from hailstorms and insect pests, resulting in a poor harvest of early-maturing crops this year and a general lack of means of subsistence for farmers. According to statistics, about 40,000 people in the county do not have enough food to last until the autumn harvest. In response to this situation, the county People's Government has mobilized the masses to adopt methods such as production for self-relief, social mutual assistance, and the distribution of relief grain, in order to solve the people's livelihood difficulties and help them overcome the summer famine.

    皖南绩溪县去年歉收，加上今春天气冷热不匀，部分地区又受了雹灾、虫灾，致使今年早熟作物收成不佳，农民生活资料普遍缺乏。据统计全县约有四万人食粮不能维持到秋收。该县人民政府根据这一情况，已发动群众，采取生产自救、社会互济以及发放救济粮等办法，借以解决群众的生活困难，帮助度过夏荒。
