　　【Report from this newspaper】Cheng Qian, a member of the Central People's Government Committee, issued the following statement on June 30 regarding Truman's statement on June 27:

　　U.S. President Truman's statement on June 27 fully exposes the U.S. imperialists' ambition to invade all of Asia and dominate the world. Truman's statement violates international agreements, undermines peace in the Far East and the world, and is a manifestation of the U.S. imperialists' premeditated, forceful, and treacherous actions. Recently, war-mongers such as Jenson, Bradley, and Dulles successively flew to Japan to conspire with MacArthur, and after Dulles flew to Seoul twice, the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, a lackey of the U.S. imperialists, launched an attack on North Korea. The facts are very clear; however, Truman's statement obliterates this fact and slanders the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, using it as an excuse to launch such a frenzied invasion, which will inevitably arouse resolute resistance from the oppressed people of all of Asia and the world.

　　Truman's statement also announced that he had ordered the U.S. imperialist Seventh Fleet to prevent any attacks on Taiwan, which is, in effect, a declaration to carry out armed aggression against Taiwan, which belongs to China. Foreign Minister Zhou's statement has already pointed out: "No matter what actions the U.S. imperialists take, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China can never be changed. This is not only a historical fact but has also been affirmed by the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the status quo after Japan's surrender." The Chinese people will resist U.S. imperialist aggression to the end. In the past, the U.S. imperialists' plan to enslave China by raising the running dog Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique has already suffered a ruthless and tragic defeat in the face of the Chinese people. Now it has come to directly carry out the adventure of invading Taiwan. The Chinese people will certainly exert even greater strength, insist on continuing to liberate Taiwan, and smash its adventure.

　　In the early days of the Soviet revolution, international imperialists invaded Soviet territory to carry out intervention, but were eventually driven out by the heroic Soviet people. Now, the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and other people's countries is doomed to repeat the same historical mistakes. Its ferocious and evil face has been completely exposed in Truman's statement. As Chairman Mao said, "This is very beneficial to the Chinese and Asian people." Our revolutionary victory is envied by the imperialists. We are not afraid of foreign aggression. The People's Republic of China has grown and developed in resisting foreign aggression. The people of the whole country should unite even more closely, consolidate the revolutionary united front, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, struggle for the complete liberation of Taiwan!

### 中央人民政府委员程潜发表谈话  斥杜鲁门声明

　　中央人民政府委员程潜发表谈话  斥杜鲁门声明
    【本报讯】中央人民政府委员程潜于六月三十日就杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明，发表谈话如下：
    美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明，充分暴露了美帝国主义侵略整个亚洲，称霸世界的野心。杜鲁门这个声明，违反了国际协议，破坏了远东和世界和平，是美帝处心积虑、强争诡夺的行动之一种表现。最近詹逊、布莱德雷、杜勒斯等战贩们相继飞日与麦克阿瑟密谋，及杜勒斯两飞汉城之后，接着美帝走狗李承晚反动集团就发动了对北韩的进攻。事实是很显然的；而杜鲁门声明，则抹煞这个事实，诬蔑朝鲜人民共和国，其借口发动这样疯狂的侵略，必将引起全亚洲和全世界被压迫人民的坚决反抗。
    杜鲁门的声明，并宣布已命令美帝第七舰队阻止对台湾的任何攻击，这实际上就是宣布要武装侵略属于中国的台湾。周外长的声明已经指出：“不管美帝国主义者采取任何行动，台湾属于中国的事实，永远不能改变，这不仅是历史的事实，且已为开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言及日本投降后的现状所肯定。”中国人民对美帝国主义的侵略是会反抗到底的。从前美帝豢养走狗蒋中正反动派以奴役中国的计划，业已在中国人民的面前，遭受到无情的惨败。现在它又来直接进行侵略台湾的冒险了。中国人民必将发挥更伟大的力量，坚持继续解放台湾，粉碎它的冒险。
    在苏联革命初期，国际帝国主义者为了进行干涉曾经侵入了苏联领土，但终于被英勇的苏联人民驱逐出去。现在美帝对中国的台湾，对朝鲜、越南等人民国家的侵略，是注定要蹈上历史的覆辙。它的穷凶极恶的面目，在杜鲁门声明中已暴露无遗。如毛主席说的，“这对中国和亚洲人民很有利益。”我们革命的胜利是为帝国主义所嫉妒的。我们不怕外患，中华人民共和国是在抵抗外患中生长发展起来的。全国人民更应该团结起来，巩固革命的统一战线，在毛主席领导之下，为彻底解放台湾而奋斗！
