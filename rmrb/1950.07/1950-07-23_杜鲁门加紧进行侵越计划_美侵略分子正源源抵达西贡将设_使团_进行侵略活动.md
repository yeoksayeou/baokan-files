　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st: American imperialism is now actively promoting the criminal plan to intensify its aggression against Vietnam as stated in Truman's statement of June 27. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Saigon on the 18th: The United States has now begun to establish several American "missions in Southeast Asia, the largest," with a total of 150 to 200 personnel. The American aggressors who make up these "missions" are now "arriving in Saigon in a steady stream." They will be stationed in the American diplomatic, Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), military, and propaganda agencies in Saigon, engaging in aggressive activities in all aspects of Vietnam, including political, economic, military, and cultural.

　　The US Consulate in Saigon has been upgraded to a legation, and a large office of military, naval, and air attachés with 30 personnel has been established. A military mission of more than 20 people will be stationed in Saigon for a long time, directly controlling military assistance to French colonialists and the puppet Bao Dai, and directing the war of aggression against the Republic of Vietnam. The first batch of personnel will arrive at the end of the month. A "military mission" composed of representatives from the US Department of Defense, the State Department, and the Economic Cooperation Administration to "investigate military needs in Southeast Asia" arrived in Saigon on the 15th after operating in the Philippines and will stay in Saigon for two weeks to formulate "plans for deploying military missions and determining assistance needs." The first batch of military supplies shipped directly from the United States to Vietnam in the open, in addition to eight aircraft that have already flown to Saigon, the remaining large quantities of munitions and equipment have now been shipped and will be unloaded in Saigon in early August.

　　The American "economic mission" in Saigon, headed by Blum, Director of the Overseas Territories Office of the ECA's French Branch, has been renamed the ECA's Indochina Branch. The agency is now actively expanding and is formulating "the first major plan for Indochina" for 23 million US dollars in "aid."

　　In order to launch its deceptive propaganda, the US Propaganda and Education Office in Saigon will be expanded, and the US Information Service is also expanding its activities to Hanoi and Phnom Penh.

    美侵略分子正源源抵达西贡将设“使团”进行侵略活动
    【新华社二十一日讯】美帝国主义现正积极推行杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明中关于加紧侵略越南的罪恶计划。据美联社西贡十八日讯：美国现已开始着手在西贡设立数个美国“在东南亚的最大的使团”，其人员总数共达一百五十名到二百名。组成这些“使团”的美国侵略分子们现正“源源抵达西贡”。他们将分驻在美国驻西贡的外交、经合总署、军事及宣传机构中，从事对越南的政治、经济、军事及文化等各方面的侵略活动。
    美国驻西贡领事馆已升格为公使馆，并已成立了人员将达三十人的庞大的陆、海、空军参赞办公处。还有一个包括二十多人的军事使团将长驻西贡，直接控制对法国殖民者与傀儡保大的军事援助，指挥对越南共和国的侵略战争。其第一批人员将于月底到达。由美国国防部、国务院、经合总署代表组成的“调查东南亚军事需要”的一个“军事使团”在菲律宾活动之后，已于十五日到西贡，并将在西贡逗留两星期，从事制定“关于派驻军事使团与确定援助需要的计划”。第一批公开从美国直接运往越南的军事物资，除八架飞机业已飞抵西贡外，其余的大批军火与装备现已启运，将于八月初在西贡起卸。
    以经合总署法国分署海外领地处处长布鲁姆为首的美国驻西贡“经济使团”，业已改为经合总署印度支那分署。该署现正积极扩充，并正在为二千三百万美元的“援助”款项制订“对印度支那的首次重大计划”。
    为了展开其欺骗宣传，在西贡的美国宣传教育处将加以扩充，美国新闻处也正在扩大其活动范围至河内和百囊奔。
