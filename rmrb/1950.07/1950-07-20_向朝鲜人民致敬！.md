To the Editor:

　　After reading in the newspaper about the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime launching the Korean civil war, and the heroic counter-offensive by the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I felt extremely angry at the U.S. aggression and had boundless admiration for the just actions of the Korean people.

　　Historically, Korea and our country have had a particularly close relationship. Especially after the "September 18th Incident," the people of both countries established an unforgettable combat friendship in their joint struggle. Geographically, Korea and our country are connected. Particularly now, China and Korea both belong to the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, fighting the U.S. aggressors side by side. Syngman Rhee, like Chiang Kai-shek, is a running dog of the United States. For this reason, my hatred for the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is no less than my hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. I also feel extraordinary respect and love for the Korean people under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung. I believe this feeling is shared by the vast majority of the Chinese people.

　　Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's traitorous activities became increasingly obvious in 1946. In 1948, they more blatantly opposed the peaceful reunification of Korea and prepared to launch a civil war. Now, they are driving the puppet troops, armed, trained, and commanded by the United States, to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attempting to further enslave all the Korean people. How can this not be infuriating!

　　I remembered the South Korean female guerrillas I saw at the Asian Women's Conference last year, and also another elderly Korean female representative who was in pain because she thought of South Korea being enslaved by the U.S. aggressors.

　　From then until now, the guerrilla war in South Korea has developed throughout the entire territory. The strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has grown even greater. The liberated working people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung, have consolidated their republic into an invincible one. The Fatherland Front, which unites more than seventy political parties and organizations, concretely embodies the great unity of all the Korean people. So, how can the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, following the old path of Chiang Kai-shek, have a different ending?

　　Indeed, we want peace; but we are never afraid of war. If the warmongers dare to launch a war, it will only accelerate their demise. Now, that South Korean female guerrilla must be intensifying her fight for the early and complete liberation of her motherland, and that old lady must no longer be shedding tears. How can we not be elated for the Korean people!

### 向朝鲜人民致敬！

　　向朝鲜人民致敬！编辑同志：
    看到报上所载，美国帝国主义和李承晚傀儡政权发动朝鲜内战，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军队英勇反攻的消息后，对美国侵略行为感到非常愤怒，而对朝鲜人民的正义行动无限敬佩。
    在历史上，朝鲜和我国关系特别亲密，特别在“九一八”以后，两国人民更在并肩的战斗中建立了永远难忘的战斗友谊。在地理上，朝鲜和我国相连，特别在现在，中朝两国同是属于以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，并肩抗击着美国侵略者，而李承晚和蒋介石一样，同是美国的走狗。由于这个原因，我对李承晚匪帮的痛恨，并不少于蒋介石匪帮的痛恨。对金日成将军领导下的朝鲜人民，也感到分外的尊敬和热爱。这种感情，我相信是绝大多数中国人民所共有的。
    在美帝操纵下，在一九四六年，李承晚匪帮的卖国勾当就越来越明显。一九四八年，则更明目张胆地反对朝鲜和平统一，并准备发动内战；而现在，他们更驱赶着由美国武装、训练和指挥的伪军向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻了，妄图进一步奴役全朝鲜人民。这怎么不令人愤怒！
    我想起了去年亚洲妇代会时所见到的南朝鲜女游击队员，也想起了另一位年老的朝鲜女代表，她因为想到南朝鲜在美国侵略者的奴役下而痛苦。
    从那时到现在，南朝鲜的游击战已发展到全境各地。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的力量已有了更大的发展，翻身了的劳动人民在劳动党和金日成将军领导下，已将他们的共和国巩固到成为不可战胜的。团结了七十多个政党、社团的祖国战线又具体的体现了全朝鲜人民的大团结。那么，走着蒋介石老路的李承晚匪帮又怎能有不同的结局？
    诚然，我们要和平；但我们决不怕战争。如果战争贩子敢于发动战争，只有加速它的死亡。现在，那位南朝鲜女游击队员一定在为祖国的早日彻底解放而加紧战斗，那位老太太也一定不会再流泪了。我们又怎能不为朝鲜人民欢欣鼓舞！
