　　Protecting Schools, Calling for Resumption of Classes, Gradually Rectifying
    Schools in Northern Sichuan Universally Recover
    [Nanchong, Northern Sichuan News] *Northern Sichuan Daily* reports: Since the liberation of Northern Sichuan in December of last year, under the guidance of the New Democratic education policy, schools at all levels have generally recovered. According to May statistics, the region has recovered 95 middle schools, with 18,695 students; 1,056 complete primary schools and 9,028 elementary primary schools, with approximately 1,000,000 students. Before liberation, schools at all levels in Northern Sichuan suffered greatly from the Kuomintang reactionaries, who disbanded schools and forced students to return home. At the beginning of liberation, many school teachers and students were scattered in the countryside. Bandits and secret agents scattered in the countryside also created rumors and deception, causing many teachers and students who did not understand the people's government's policies to hesitate and wait. To this end, the people's government issued orders to protect schools and called for the resumption of classes, and also universally organized a short-term political study for the resumption of classes. According to incomplete statistics, more than 14,000 middle school students in 36 counties participated in the resumption of classes, and more than 580 students in 8 counties participated in winter vacation tutoring classes or youth academies; more than 13,000 primary and secondary school teachers in the region participated in seminars to study. Around the Lunar New Year, secondary schools in various counties gradually started classes and carried out preliminary rectification. In all schools, reactionary courses such as civics, military training, boy scouts, and party principles, as well as the "guidance" system, were abolished, and political classes were added.

　　保护学校号召复课逐步整顿
    川北中小学普遍恢复
    【川北南充讯】川北日报消息：川北地区自去年十二月解放以来，在新民主主义教育方针的指导下，各级学校已普遍恢复。据五月份统计，全区已恢复中等学校九十五所，学生一万八千六百九十五人；完小一千零五十六所，初小九千零二十八所，学生约一百万人。川北区在解放前夜，各级学校曾受国民党反动派的极大摧残，他们解散学校，强令学生回家。解放之初，许多学校师生都散居乡间。流散在乡的匪军、特务又造谣欺骗，使许多不明了人民政府政策的师生徘徊观望。人民政府为此一面明令保护学校，号召复课，一面又普遍地组织了一次短期的复课政治学习。据不完全统计，三十六个县即有一万四千余中学生参加了复课学习，八个县有五百八十余名学生参加了寒假补习班或青年学园学习；全区有一万三千余中小学教师参加了座谈会，进行学习。至阴历年前后，各县中等学校即逐次开课，并进行了初步整顿。在各校均取消了反动的公民、军训、童军、党义等课程和“训导”制度，增加了政治课。
