Xinhua News Agency, 29th:

Lie’s efforts to scrounge up cannon fodder from the vast majority of capitalist member states of the United Nations for the American aggressors in Korea have largely been rejected. In Europe, according to the Associated Press, "Capitals in Europe indicate that no government can send ground troops to Korea without dangerously weakening its own defenses. Only France and the Netherlands have strong, well-organized armies in Europe, but they are already heavily burdened." France is already overburdened by its war of aggression in Vietnam, and Dutch troops, after a "long and arduous" war of aggression against Indonesia, are waiting to return home. "Belgium and the Scandinavian countries have only small armies" and cannot and do not want to send troops. In addition to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and other countries that have refused to send troops, Sweden replied to Lie on the 20th that it was sending a field hospital to South Korea, but "cannot change its policy of not sending troops abroad." The Greek royal fascist government replied that its "armed forces are too small" to send ground troops to South Korea. Meanwhile, Dutch Commander-in-Chief in Indonesia, Frijden, told reporters: "Even if the Dutch government very much wants to send ground troops to Korea, we cannot carry out this order because the soldiers do not want to go. The Dutch soldiers have only one hope, and that is to return to the Netherlands" (Aneta News Agency).

In Asia, Pakistan stated that it "cannot send any troops to fight in Korea." The Iranian government replied to Lie, saying, "It cannot comply." Afghanistan "expressed its apologies." Lebanon dramatically remitted $50,000 to Lie as a "donation." The American puppet Philippine government, in addition to stating that it could organize volunteers to be equipped by the United States, puppet President Quirino reiterated at a press conference on the 24th that "the Philippines is currently unable to send troops to Korea due to a lack of personnel, money, and weapons."

In the Americas, besides Canada saying it could not send ground troops, senior Brazilian army personnel stated that sending a regular expeditionary force at present was an "impossible task" for Brazil. Brazilian Army Minister Costa said on the 21st that Brazil would provide other "valuable" assistance but would not send troops. Bolivia decided to send 30 officers to be "commanded" by MacArthur (Associated Press). The Cuban government replied to Lie on the 26th, saying that it was prepared to supply raw materials but indicated that even symbolic troops could not be sent.

In Africa, the South African cabinet decided on the 20th that "direct military assistance from South Africa to Korea is neither practical nor realistic."

Since Lie issued a request to 59 countries on the 14th urging them to send troops, only a few countries under the wing of American imperialism – Thailand and Nicaragua – have explicitly agreed to send 5,000 troops. The 5,000 soldiers Thailand promised to send will have to undergo a month of training before they can be dispatched. The reactionary Turkish government has only begun to "suggest" sending 4,500 troops. In addition, under the pressure of American imperialism, Australia and New Zealand have decided to send troops. According to the Dentsu News Agency, "The Australian intervention force will be transferred from the occupying forces stationed in Japan, and New Zealand will send artillery." Therefore, the number of their dispatched troops will be very limited.

### 赖伊为美国侵略者搜罗炮灰成绩甚微  各资本主义国家内部困难重重  无力派遣地面部队赴朝鲜帮凶

　　赖伊为美国侵略者搜罗炮灰成绩甚微
    各资本主义国家内部困难重重  无力派遣地面部队赴朝鲜帮凶
    【新华社二十九日讯】联合国绝大多数的资本主义会员国，对于赖伊要他们派地面部队到朝鲜为美国侵略者充当炮灰的要求，纷纷加以拒绝。在欧洲方面，据合众社称：“欧洲各首都显示：没有任何一个政府能派遣地面部队到朝鲜而不危险地削弱自己的防务。欧洲仅有法国与荷兰有强大的组织良好的陆军，但已负担沉重。”法国对越南的侵略战争已负担过重，而荷兰军队在对印尼进行了“长期而艰苦的”侵略战争之后，正等候回国。“比利时与斯堪的纳维亚国家仅有小支陆军”，都不能派兵，而且也不愿派兵。除了法、荷、比、丹、挪等国已拒绝出兵外，瑞典于二十日答复赖伊说：它正在向南朝鲜派遣一个战地医院，但是“不能改变不派兵出国的政策”。希腊保皇法西斯政府的答复说：它的“武装部队过少”，不能派地面部队到南朝鲜去。同时，荷兰驻印尼军总司令佛莱登对记者说：“纵然荷兰政府很希望派遣地面部队到朝鲜去，我们也不能执行这种命令，因为士兵们不愿意去。荷兰士兵们只有一个希望，那就是回荷兰去”（安普通讯社）。
    在亚洲方面，巴基斯坦表示“不能派遣任何军队到朝鲜作战”。伊朗政府回答赖伊说：“它不能应命”。阿富汗则“表示抱歉”。黎巴嫩则戏剧性地汇五万美元给赖伊作为“赠款”。美国的傀儡菲律宾政府除了表示可以组织须由美国装备的志愿军以外，傀儡总统季里诺二十四日在记者会上重申“目前菲律宾由于缺乏人、钱、武器，无力向朝鲜派兵”。
    在美洲方面，除加拿大已表示不能派遣地面部队之外，巴西高级陆军人士称：目前派遣正规远征军对巴西说来是一件“不可能的任务”，巴西陆军部长柯斯塔二十一日说，巴西将给以其他“宝贵的”援助，但不派遣军队。玻利维亚则决定派军官三十人给麦克阿瑟“指挥”（合众社）。古巴政府二十六日答复赖伊，说准备供给原料，但表示即使象征性部队也不能派遣。
    非洲方面，南非内阁二十日决议说：“南非洲给予朝鲜直接军事援助，既难实行，亦不合乎实际情形。”
    从赖伊在十四日向五十九国发出催促派兵的要求以后，到现在为止，只有美帝国主义卵翼下的少数国家——泰国和尼加拉瓜，明确地答应派兵五千名。泰国答应派出的五千名兵士，还要经过一个月的训练之后，才能派出。土耳其反动政府才开始“建议”派兵四千五百名。此外，在美帝国主义的压力下，澳大利亚和新西兰已决定出兵。据电通社称：“澳大利亚的干涉军将由驻日占领军调往，新西兰将派遣炮兵”。因此，它们的派遣军数量，将是十分有限的。
