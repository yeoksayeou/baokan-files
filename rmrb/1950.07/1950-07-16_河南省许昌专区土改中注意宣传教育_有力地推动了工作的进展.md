Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, July 13th: Carrying out propaganda and education regarding land reform in an organized manner is one of the important guarantees for completing land reform. In the land reform, Xuchang Prefecture in Henan Province paid attention to propaganda and education, which powerfully promoted the progress of the land reform movement.

	Policy Education Conducted for Cadres During Land Reform, Policy Propaganda Launched to People of All Strata

The experience of the prefecture proves that policy education for cadres and policy propaganda for people of all strata are very important in land reform. Before the full-scale land reform movement in half of the prefecture's area in November of last year, and before the land reform movement in the other half of the prefecture's area in March of this year, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened land conferences with the nature of Party rectification (including persons in charge of each county and the main persons in charge of the districts), and trained Party member cadres at all levels in the districts and townships level by level. A total of 3,496 Party member cadres at all levels in the entire prefecture received training before and after. The content of the training included not only the land reform policy, but also rural work methods for mobilizing peasants and the specific steps for carrying out land reform. Phenomena that violated the policy and empirical work methods were criticized and corrected. Veteran cadres with old liberated area land reform work experience initially had great resistance to certain specific policies stipulated in the land reform regulations (such as not digging up the hidden wealth of landlords, not touching floating wealth, etc.); but after repeated education and repeated discussions based on practical experience, the cadres in general were able to more deeply understand and accept these policies. Prior to this, when Baofeng and other seven counties in the prefecture conducted key land reform experiments in typical villages, because the cadres had not been trained and their policy thinking was chaotic, there was once a tendency to wrongly determine class status, infringe on the interests of middle peasants, and even kill people indiscriminately in violation of policy. After this systematic education, phenomena that violated policies in the land reform work basically never occurred again.

The people's governments of the counties universally convened people's representative conferences at all levels, and peasant representative conferences at the county, district, and township levels. Various meetings such as women, militia, and youth meetings were held in the villages. The people's governments of the counties organized nearly 10,000 propagandists through this method. Various representatives spread throughout every corner, contacting different objects, enabling the land reform policy of the people's government to be implemented to the masses of all strata. This played a great role in raising the class consciousness of the peasants, stabilizing the production mood of the peasants of all strata, and reducing the sabotage of the landlords. In addition, each county held training classes for intellectuals with 200 to 500 people, organizing them to publicize land reform. According to statistics, there were approximately more than 5,000 intellectuals participating in the training throughout the prefecture, including a part of the intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families. After learning, these intellectuals became a considerable force in the propaganda and education work of land reform. Some children from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds explained the policy to the landlords and rich peasants, so that they would abide by the law.

	Various Forms of Propaganda, Mainly Grasping Three Links

There are various forms of propaganda. For example, during the land reform period, the people's governments of the counties all set up public inquiry offices. In addition, they also organized teachers and students of primary and secondary schools to perform itinerant dramas, issued large quantities of documents, and held rural blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, etc. The public inquiry office of Wuyang County received more than 200 people who came to inquire about land reform issues in one month. The county high school in the county toured various districts performing "The White Haired Girl" and "Blood and Tears of Hatred," which greatly inspired the awakening of the peasants. During this land reform, the Xuchang Administrative Office and the county governments issued tens of thousands of copies of the Land Reform Regulations, public notices, etc. on both occasions. In Xuchang and other six counties, each village cadre and primary school teacher had an average of one document.

In the propaganda and education of land reform, the people's governments at all levels in Xuchang Prefecture mainly grasped the following important links: First, conducting class education and solidarity education for peasants. Through the forms of poor peasant and farm laborer representative meetings, they were mobilized to pour out their grievances and calculate exploitation accounts, so that they understood the principle of "who supports whom." In Liangbatai Township, Wuyang County, more than 40 tenant households in one hamlet rented 240 mu of land from landlords, and were exploited of more than 31,000 jin of grain each year, which was enough for middle and poor peasants in the entire hamlet to eat for five and a half months. After such calculation, the peasants understood the truth that landlords live by exploiting peasants. Further, they combined the rectification of rural organizations with democratic elections, conducted democratic education, and established the peasants' sense of being masters of their own affairs. The "solidarity education" of peasants mainly explained the principle that "middle and poor peasants are one family." In particular, it is most important to carry out ideological education of "peasants all over the world are one family" when distributing land, so as to correct the patriarchal and sectarian ideas of the peasants. Disputes will not be caused when the land is reasonably adjusted between villages. Second, explain how to divide classes. At the peasant representative meetings and peasant congresses, typical households were listed to explain the specific methods of division; difficult problems were solved in a concentrated manner to correct some of the peasants' vague concepts. In the talk of class division, it is associated with the exploitation of landlords and the suffering of peasants, further enlighten the peasants' will to struggle. The experience of Xuchang proves that the more in-depth the propaganda of class division, the fewer the problems of wrongly determining class status. Third, publicize the laws and policies of confiscation and requisition. Educate peasants to distinguish the boundaries of confiscation and requisition, make resolutions, and formulate discipline. At the same time, educate and encourage landlords to self-report and truthfully report, and point out to the landlords that they can get the same share of land as the peasants, and that they can be transformed into new people in labor, so as to reduce the resistance of the movement.

Now the land reform work in the thirteen counties of Xuchang Prefecture has ended. When the land reform was coming to an end, the above-mentioned counties had already begun to carry out propaganda and education for peasants to defend their liberated interests and develop production.

　　河南省许昌专区土改中注意宣传教育
    有力地推动了工作的进展
    【新华社开封十三日电】有组织地开展有关土地改革的宣传教育工作，是完成土地改革的重要保证之一。河南省许昌专区在土地改革中注意了宣传教育工作，曾经有力地推动了土地改革运动的前进。
            土改中对干部进行政策教育  向各阶层人民展开政策宣传
    该专区的经验证明：在土地改革中对干部的政策教育和对各阶层人民的政策宣传工作是很重要的。去年十一月该专区一半地区全面开展土地改革运动以前，和今年三月该专区另一半地区开展土地改革运动以前，中共许昌地委会均曾召开整党性质的土地会议（包括各县负责人，及区的主要负责人），并逐级训练了区、乡各级党员干部。全专区总计前后受训的各级党员干部共三千四百九十六人。训练的内容，除土地改革政策以外，还包括发动农民的农村工作方法与进行土地改革的具体工作步骤。违反政策的现象和经验主义的工作方法都受到批评和纠正。有老区土地改革工作经验的老干部，一开始总是对于土地改革条例所规定的某些具体政策（如对地主不挖底财，不动浮财等）有很大抵触；但是经过反复教育和根据实际经验反复讨论以后，一般干部都能较深刻地认识和接受这些政策。在此以前，该专区宝丰等七县在典型乡村重点实验土地改革时，因为干部未经训练，政策思想混乱，曾经一度发生了错订成份、侵犯中农利益，甚至乱打乱杀等违犯政策的偏向。经过这次系统的教育后，土地改革工作中违犯政策的现象就基本上再未发生了。
    各县人民政府曾经普遍召开各界人民代表会议和县、区、乡各级农民代表会议，乡村中都开过妇女、民兵、青年等各种会议。各县人民政府通过这一方式组织了近万人的宣传队伍。各种代表遍布每个角落，联系不同的对象，使人民政府的土地改革政策得以贯彻到各阶层群众中去。这对于提高农民的阶级觉悟，稳定各阶层农民的生产情绪，以及减少地主的破坏，都起了极大的作用。此外，每个县还举办了二百至五百人的知识分子训练班，组织他们宣传土地改革。据统计，全专区参加训练的知识分子约有五千多人，包括一部分地主富农家庭出身的知识分子在内。这些知识分子经过学习以后，成了土地改革宣传教育工作上的一批可观的力量。有的地主富农出身的子弟，向地主富农讲解政策，让他们守法。
            宣传形式多种多样  主要抓住三个环节
    宣传形式是多种多样的。如土地改革期中，各县人民政府都设置有民众问事处，此外，还曾组织中小学校师生巡回演剧，大量印发文件，举办乡村黑板报、屋顶广播等等。舞阳县的民众问事处，一个月内来询问土地改革问题的有二百多人。该县县立中学在全县各区巡回演出《白毛女》、《血泪仇》，对启发农民觉悟有很大作用。许昌专署和各县政府在这次土地改革中，前后印发了土地改革条例、布告等数万份。许昌等六县每个村干部、小学教师平均每人有一册文件。
    许昌专区各级人民政府在土地改革的宣传教育中，主要抓住了下列几个重要环节：第一是对农民进行阶级教育和团结教育。通过贫农雇农代表会议等形式，发动他们诉苦，算剥削账，使他们了解“谁养活谁”的道理。舞阳县梁八台乡一个闾的四十多户佃户，共租种地主土地二百四十亩，每年被剥削粮食三万一千多斤，够全闾中农、贫农五个半月的吃粮。这样一算，农民才明白了地主靠剥削农民生活的真理。进一步就结合整顿乡村组织实行民主选举，进行民主教育，树立农民群众的主人翁思想。对农民的“团结教育”主要是说明“中贫农是一家”的道理。特别是分配土地时进行“天下农民是一家”的思想教育最重要，这样可以纠正农民的宗法的和宗派的思想。在乡村之间合理调剂土地时不致引起纠纷。第二，是讲解如何划分阶级。在农民代表会议和农民大会上，都列举典型户来讲解划分的具体方法；集中疑难问题予以解答，纠正某些农民的模糊观念。在讲划分阶级中并联系地主的剥削和农民的痛苦，进一步启发农民的斗争意志。许昌的经验证明：划分阶级的宣传越深入，错订成份的毛病就越少。第三，宣传没收、征收的法令政策。教育农民划清没收、征收的界限，作出决议，制订纪律。同时也教育与鼓励地主自报、实报，并向地主指出他们可以分得与农民同样的一份土地，他们是可以在劳动中改造成为新人的，这样就可以减少运动的阻力。
    现在许昌专区十三个县的土地改革工作已经结束，在土地改革接近结束时，上述各县就已经开始向农民进行保卫翻身利益和发展生产的宣传教育了。
