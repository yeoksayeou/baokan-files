[Fuzhou News] Fujian Daily News: In most areas of Putian County, Fujian Province, the early rice harvest has been completed. The general harvest is good, with the highest yield reaching 500 catties per mu, and an average of about 300 catties per mu. According to investigations, the government's distribution of agricultural loans this spring played a significant role in increasing production. Fields that received loans increased rice production by about 100 catties per mu. For example, Chen Xijiu, a poor peasant in Wujiang Township, lacked fertilizer every year in the past. This year, he received 260 catties of rice in spring loans, had sufficient fertilizer, and the early rice harvest reached 500 catties per mu. According to farmers, in the past, the distance in the quality of rice ears between the fields cultivated by rich peasants and poor peasants was extremely far. This year, due to the availability of loans, the early rice growth is now quite similar.

Also, early rice in the first district of Minhou (Fuzhou) has matured, with rice ears drooping, and the fields are a golden yellow. A full-scale harvest can begin in two or three days. This year, each rice ear has about twenty more grains than in previous years, which can increase production by more than 10%. In particular, the "Nante No." improved grain seeds used in Jin Yuandun, Chengmen, and other townships have good quality, strong insect resistance, and even better yields.

[This newspaper] The early rice harvest in Jiangxi Province has begun, and the general harvest is very good. In Yugan County, except for some areas where production was reduced due to flooding, most areas have grown very well, with a yield of four to five *shi* of rice per mu; even the poorer areas have around three *shi*. In Lian Tang Village and Chunqiao Village in the fourth district of Nanchang County, new grain has already come on the market. In Pingxiang and other counties in southwestern Jiangxi, the early rice harvest is also about to begin. At present, the vast laboring farmers are preparing sickles and other tools with boundless joy, ready for the harvest.

[This newspaper] The early rice harvest in Shishou County, Hubei, will be completed within a few days. This year, the rainfall in the county was well-distributed, and the new rice growth was exceptionally full. Only five large ears are needed to yield one *sheng* of grain. The farmers are overjoyed and are preparing to plant late autumn crops after the harvest. At present, new grain in Tuanshan District of the county has already come on the market, and the Shishou State-owned Trading Company is preparing to vigorously purchase it to maintain a reasonable price for the new grain.

　　福建江西湖北等省早稻丰收
    【福州讯】福建日报消息：福建省莆田县大部地区早稻已收割完毕。一般收成良好，每亩产量最高可达五百斤，平均在三百斤左右。据调查，今春政府发放农贷，对提高产量作用很大，受贷田每亩约增产稻谷百斤。如吴江乡贫农陈锡九，过去年年缺肥，今年获春贷大米二百六十斤，施肥充足，早谷收成每亩达五百斤。据农民反映，过去富农与贫农所耕田地，稻穗好坏距离极远，今年因有了贷款，早稻生长情形，已相差不多。
    又闽侯（福州）一区早稻已熟，稻穗下垂，田野一片金黄，二、三天内即可开始全面收割。今年每一稻穗谷粒比往年约增二十余颗，能增产一成以上。尤其金元墩、城门等乡采用“南特号”优良谷种，质地好，抗虫力强，产量更好。
    【本报讯】江西省早稻开始收割，一般收成都很好。余干县早稻除个别地区因被水淹减产外，大部地区都长得很好，每亩可收稻谷四、五石；较差的也有三石上下。南昌县四区莲塘村、春桥村已有新谷上市。赣西南的萍乡等县早稻亦将开始收割，现广大劳动农民正以无限喜悦的心情，纷纷准备镰刀等工具，准备收割。
                                   （惠东）
    【本报讯】湖北石首县早稻日内即可收割完毕。该县今年雨水调匀，新稻成长异常丰满。仅五大穗，即可打谷一升。农民喜形于色，准备在收割后，再种晚秋。现该县团山区新谷已经上市，石首国营贸易公司正准备大力收购，以保持新谷合理价格。
