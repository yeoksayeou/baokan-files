　　Opposing Profiteering from Adjusting Public-Private Relations
　　Wu Qungan
　　In mid-April, Chairman Mao pointed out that adjusting public-private relations is the central task of financial and economic leading organs in the future. In May, the Central Finance and Economics Commission convened a national meeting of directors of industry and commerce bureaus from seven major cities. Since then, a series of measures have been taken to adjust public-private relations. Significant progress has been made in public-private relations nationwide, and the difficulties of private industrial and commercial enterprises have been greatly alleviated.
　　This phenomenon is not accidental. Primarily, this is because state-owned enterprises have basically been able to grasp clear policy ideas, and most private enterprises have also been able to use government assistance to actively transform their enterprise structures and management policies, gradually achieving break-even production. In the past, some state-owned enterprises did not establish the concept of long-term division of labor and cooperation with private capitalism in their thinking. Some engaged in "assistance for the sake of assistance" or "care for the sake of care," reducing the policy of taking into account both public and private interests to the level of temporary relief. Some did not provide enough assistance and care, and even individual cases of mutual exclusion and squeezing occurred between public and private entities, leading to non-cooperation. Now, under Chairman Mao's call, state-owned enterprises have corrected and are correcting these deviations. Coupled with the efforts of most private enterprises to transform themselves, the face of public-private relations has been renewed.
　　However, it must be pointed out that the existing public-private relations still have fairly serious shortcomings. That is, some private industrialists and businessmen are attempting to profit from the adjustment of public-private relations, wanting to take the opportunity to make a fortune, or are perfunctory. Therefore, in addition to maintaining and continuing to strengthen the correct adjustments of the past, it is necessary to find ways to correct the opportunistic and irresponsible attitudes of certain private industrialists and businessmen in order to further advance public-private relations.
　　These irresponsible and opportunistic attitudes mainly include the following four aspects:
　　First, violating contracts, delivering goods late, delivering fewer goods than agreed, or delivering defective goods.
　　There are two situations here. The first is irresponsibility. When accepting government entrusted processing or orders, they do not ask whether their equipment can handle it or whether the production plan is guaranteed, but accept the order first. After receiving the order, they do not actively mobilize the workers, improve technology, streamline and save, reduce costs, and inspect products, resulting in the inability to complete the delivery task. For example, according to the inspection results of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, only five yarn factories, including Zhaofeng, can meet the Grade A standard for the quality of cotton yarn for processing. The rest have varying degrees of flaws, insufficient yarn counts, excessive moisture absorption, and insufficient twist. Some of the fabrics submitted by some manufacturers also have short lengths, mildew, oil stains, and holes. However, after research and review, the second inspection showed considerable improvement. Another example is rubber industry orders. Dachunghua and Zhengtai factories received an order for 47,000 dozens of rubber shoes, with the agreement to deliver them all by June 5. However, as of June 12, one-fourth could not be delivered. In the case of goods returned due to defective quality, the first batch of goods delivered by Dachunghua accounted for 14 percent, and Zhengtai accounted for 20 percent. These are all manifestations of irresponsibility and perfunctory work. The second is to try to make a fortune, treating government entrusted processing products or state bank loans as their own assets, using them to repay old debts or selling them privately, resulting in the inability to deliver goods or only being able to deliver defective goods. On March 23, Shenxin No. 6 Factory contracted to spin 559 pieces of cotton yarn, and Shenxin No. 7 Factory contracted to spin 409 pieces, stipulating that they should be delivered by April 11. However, by the due date, Shenxin No. 6 only delivered 60 pieces, and Shenxin No. 7 only delivered 129 pieces. During the processing period, Shenxin No. 6 sold 316 pieces directly in the market, and Shenxin No. 7 sold 420 pieces (another 50 pieces were pledged to the People's Bank). It can be seen that the two factories sold most of the government's entrusted processing materials in the market, leaving only a small amount to be delivered to the government. This is a violation of contract and opportunistic behavior for profit.
　　Second, they want everything in processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans, the more the better. Some even plan to take on large batches and then distribute them to their peers, exploiting them in the process. Some, in addition to maintaining production, also plan to use the funds to expand equipment in order to request more processing and orders. Individually, some even exaggerate their achievements in improving labor-management relations and break-even production in order to deceive the government to obtain more processing orders and loans.
　　This dishonest attitude mainly stems from the fact that they do not view the adjustment of public-private relations from the standpoint of taking into account both public and private interests in their thinking, and they do not appreciate what Vice Premier Chen Yun said: entrusted processing, ordering, and purchasing "should be based on the needs and possibilities of the country. The so-called needs mean that the goods entrusted for processing, ordered, or purchased should be useful to the country at present or in the future." Because if the goods entrusted for processing, ordered, or purchased by the state do not meet the needs of the present or the future, the state will not be able to sell the goods it has swallowed, and the funds will be frozen, which will weaken the ability to continue to assist private enterprises, which is harmful to both the public and private sectors. "The so-called possibility refers to the quantity of entrusted processing, ordering, and purchasing, which should be limited to the possibility of the country's existing economic strength. If it is carried out reluctantly beyond this limit, it will inevitably lead to inflation and undermine price stability, which is not only detrimental to the vast number of people, but also detrimental to the private enterprises themselves."
　　Third, some private enterprises do not try to reduce costs themselves, but only hope that the processing fees and ordering and purchasing prices entrusted by the government will be as high as possible. Some individual manufacturers have not even accurately calculated production costs, but only unilaterally complain that the pricing is too low, and use it as an excuse for cutting corners. For example, the Daxing factory in the rubber industry originally said that it would lose money if it accepted government orders. However, after careful calculation by the factory's resident staff and labor-management representatives, it turned out that the production of 30,000 raincoats this time, with a price of 1.0053 billion yuan, would yield a profit of more than 31.5 million yuan after paying for raw materials and all expenses.
　　This attitude is also dishonest. However, ideologically speaking, it mainly starts from the standpoint of "private interests first." First of all, they have not realized what Vice Premier Chen Yun instructed: "The purchase price should be based on the market price, and should not be lower or higher than the market price. The processing fees should be calculated based on the cost of reasonable operation at the medium level in the processing area. For orders where the market price is lower than the cost and the state loses money, the capitalist should adhere to the principle of breaking even. For normal orders where the market price is higher than the cost and the state makes a profit, the capitalist should obtain reasonable profits in addition to the cost." Secondly, they have not realized that the government's current processing fees and ordering and purchasing prices can already cover the costs for manufacturers with medium operating standards, while the government is providing considerable subsidies. Taking contract weaving as an example, according to a report by Qin Liufang, deputy manager of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, on July 1, the government's contract weaving of cotton cloth in May resulted in a subsidy of 1,626 yuan per piece. In June, it increased to 5,794 yuan. At the end of June, due to a slight increase in yarn prices, the cost was even higher, and the subsidy for contract weaving of cotton cloth increased to 10,962 yuan per piece. Therefore, the main problem for private factories with poor management is how to actively transform their enterprises to reduce costs, and should not unilaterally request the government to increase processing fees and ordering and purchasing prices.
　　Fourth, rush to purchase raw materials and hoard for speculation. For example, after the announcement of the national machinery industry processing plan, the prices of hardware soared several times. The decision to expand contract dyeing at the East China Textile Conference led to a surge in dye prices. Rubber industry orders also caused the price of raw rubber to rise continuously. On the one hand, raw material merchants took the opportunity to manipulate prices, seeking exorbitant profits. On the other hand, manufacturers accepting processing and ordering rushed to purchase and hoard, fueling the rising trend.
　　For speculative raw material merchants, the government should strictly ban them in accordance with Article 37 of the Common Program: "Speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly banned." Moreover, the government's processing and ordering are planned, and there are considerable preparations for the required raw materials. Blindly speculative raw material merchants will eventually suffer the consequences. For the few manufacturers who participate in the rush to purchase, today's problem is a whole, and the public and private sectors must jointly unite and plan to unify procurement and distribution in order to relatively solve the difficulties of the lack of certain industrial raw materials today. If they rush to purchase and disrupt the steps themselves, the price of raw materials will be driven higher and higher, which will not only give raw material merchants a good opportunity, but also increase the cost of industrial production, which is extremely detrimental to themselves.
　　In summary, these four kinds of irresponsible and opportunistic ideological styles are all rooted in starting from the standpoint of "private interests first" to "transform the public into private," "forgetting the public for the sake of private," and "having private but no public," which violates the fundamental spirit of taking into account both public and private interests. This has a certain historical origin. Under the long-term rule of imperialism and bureaucratic compradors in the past, some Shanghai industrialists and businessmen have long been accustomed to the rules of taking advantage of loopholes, telling lies, deceiving, and engaging in opportunistic trickery. At that time, it was difficult to get rich if one did not master this rule. Since liberation, most industrialists and businessmen have realized that the old rules are no longer applicable, but some have not completely abandoned them and still want to try them out when they have the opportunity.
　　Although these people are a minority, because they directly endanger the country's assets and undermine the implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, they have now become the main obstacle to continuing to adjust public-private relations. Therefore, our industrial and commercial administrative organs, state-owned enterprises, trade unions, and trade associations must raise their vigilance, strengthen inspections, urge the transformation of private enterprises, strengthen their ideological education, correct these irresponsible and opportunistic malpractices, and promote an honest and down-to-earth attitude, so that our great project of adjusting public-private relations can continue to move forward and achieve greater victories.

　　反对从调整公私关系中投机取巧
    吴群敢
    四月中旬毛主席指出调整公私关系是今后财经领导机关工作的重心，五月份时中央财委会召开全国七大城市工商局长会议，此后即采取一系列措施调整公私关系，在全国范围内公私关系已有显著的进步，私营工商业的困难，从而也大为减轻。
    这种现象并不是偶然的。主要的这是由于公营企业基本上已能掌握明确的政策思想，私营企业大多也能运用政府的扶助，用以积极改造企业机构和经营方针，逐渐做到保本生产。在过去，公营企业有些没有在思想上确立长期与私人资本主义分工合作的观念，有的“为扶助而扶助”、“为照顾而照顾”，把公私兼顾的政策降低为临时救济的水平；有的扶助照顾不够，甚至公私之间个别的还发生相互排挤、倾轧等不合作的现象。现在，公营企业在毛主席的号召下，纠正了并正在改正着这些偏差，再加上大多数私营企业的努力改造，就使公私关系的面目为之一新。
    但必需指出：现有的公私关系仍存在着相当严重的缺点，即还有一部分的私营工商业家企图在调整公私关系中投机取巧，想要趁机捞一把，或是敷衍了事。因此，现在除了保持并继续加强过去正确的调整以外，必需设法纠正某些私营工商业家投机取巧和不负责任的态度，才能使公私关系继续往前推进一步。
    这种不负责任和投机取巧的态度，主要的有下列四种：
    第一、违反合同，迟交货、少交货、交坏货。
    在这里又有两种情形。第一种是不负责任，在接受政府委托加工或订货时，不问自己设备是否做得了，生产计划有无保证，接到再说。在到手以后，又不积极发动工人群众，改进技术，精简节约，减低成本，检验产品，致使无法完成交货任务。例如代纺棉纱品质，据花纱布公司检验的结果，能合乎甲级标准的仅有兆丰等五家纱厂，其余大多格林轻重不一，纺纱圈数不足，吸湿过多，捻度不足等。部分厂商所缴代织布匹，也有短码、发霉、油污、破洞等现象。但经研究检讨后，第二次检验时，已有相当进步。又如橡胶业订货，大中华、正泰两厂接到一野定货胶鞋四万七千打，约定六月五日交清，但截至六月十二日止，尚有四分之一无法交出。因交坏货而被退货者，大中华第一批交货占百分之一四，正泰占百分之二○。这些都是不负责任，和敷衍马虎的表现。第二种是存心捞一把，把政府委托加工的产品或国家银行的贷款，当作自己的资财，用作偿还旧欠或私自出卖，致使无法交货或只能交出坏货。三月二十三日，申新六厂订约代纺棉纱五五九件，申新七厂订约代纺四○九件，规定在四月十一日交清；但到期时申六仅交出六十件，申七仅交出一二九件；而在代纺期中直接在市场出售者，申六达三一六件，申七达四二○件（另有五十件向人民银行押款），可见该两厂将政府代纺物资大部分都在市场卖掉，仅留少数交缴政府，这是违反合约，取巧图利的行为。
    第二、加工、订货、收购、贷款，什么都要，多多益善。甚至有的准备大批包下来，再分给同业，从中剥削；有的维持生产之外，还准备用作扩充设备，以便要求更多的加工和订货。个别的还有为要争取更多的加工订货和贷款，常夸大其改善劳资关系和保本生产的成绩，来欺蒙政府。
    这种不老实的态度，主要的还是在思想上没有从公私兼顾的立场来看调整公私关系，没有体会到陈云副总理所说的：委托加工、订货、收购“应当根据国家的需要与可能。所谓需要是说委托加工的、所订的、所收购的货物，应当对国家目前或将来有用。”因为如果国家所委托加工的、所订的、所收购的货物，不合于目前或将来的需要，就使国家吞进来的货物吐不出去，资金既被冻结，就削弱了对私营企业继续扶助的能力，对公私双方都有害无益。“所谓可能，就是指所委托加工的、所订的、所收购的数量，应当以国家现有经济力量的可能为限，如果超过这个限度勉强进行，势必引起通货膨胀，破坏物价稳定，这就不仅不利于广大人民，而且也不利于私人企业本身”。
    第三、有一部分私营企业自己不设法减低成本，只希望政府委托加工的工缴和订货、收购的价格，越高越好。甚至个别厂家还没有精确核算生产成本，只是片面地埋怨订价太低，并作为偷工减料的借口。例如橡胶业的大兴厂，原说承接政府订货要亏本，但经驻厂员会同劳资双方精密结算结果，这次承制雨衣三万件，价款十亿零五千三百万元，除付购原料及一切开支外，尚有利润三千一百五十余万元。
    这种态度，也是不老实的。但从思想上说，主要的也只从“私方一利”的立场上出发，首先是没有认识到陈云副总理所指示的：“收购价格应根据市价，不应低于或高于市价，加工的工缴费，应根据加工地区合理经营的中等水准计算成本。凡市价低于成本由国家赔本的订货，资方应以保本为原则，凡市价高于成本，国家有利的正常订货，资方应在成本之外取得合理利润。”其次是没有认识到政府现在加工工缴和订货、收购价格对于中等经营水准的厂家已可敷本，而在政府方面则赔贴颇巨。以代织为例，据七月一日花纱布公司副经理秦柳方报告，政府代织棉布在五月份时每匹赔贴一、六二六元，六月份增至五、七九四元，六月底时，因纱价稍涨，成本更高，代织棉布每匹赔贴更增至一○、九六二元。因此现在经营较差的私营工厂，主要的是如何积极努力改造企业以减低成本的问题，而不应一味片面地请求政府提高加工工缴和订货、收购价格。
    第四、抢购原料，囤积投机。例如全国机器工业加工计划公布后，五金行情暴涨数倍；华东纺织会议决定扩大代染，就引起染料价格的哄抬；橡胶业订货也使生橡胶价格连续上涨。一方面是原料商人趁机扳价，图谋暴利；另一方面是承接加工、订货厂商抢购囤积，助长涨风。
    对于投机的原料商人来说，政府应根据共同纲领第三十七条的规定：“对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔”。而且政府的加工、订货，是有计划的，对于所需原料是有相当准备的，盲目投机的原料商人，终将自食其果。对于少数参加抢购的厂商来说，今天的问题是整个的，必须公私双方共同联合起来，有计划地统一采购和分配，才可相对地解决今天某些工业原料缺乏的困难；如果争先抢购，自乱步骤，原料价格将越哄越高，那不但给予原料商人一个好机会，而且也将增加工业生产的成本，对自己极为不利的。
    总结来说，这四种不负责任和投机取巧的思想作风，都是根源于只从“私方一利”的立场出发来“化公为私”，“私而忘公”，“有私无公”，违反了公私兼顾的根本精神。这是有其一定的历史渊源的，在过去帝国主义，官僚买办的长期统治下，上海工商业家有些久已习惯于钻空子、说假话、欺骗蒙蔽，投机取巧的规律，当时谁要是不掌握这个规律，就很难发财致富。解放以来，工商业家大多都体会到旧的规律已不适用，但还有一部分仍未完全放弃，有机会时还想搬出来试试看。
    这种人虽是少数，但因其直接危害国家的资财，破坏公私兼顾政策的推行，现已成为继续调整公私关系的主要障碍。因此，我们工商行政机关、公营企业、工会、同业公会，必须提高警惕、加强检查、督促私营企业的改造并加强其思想教育，纠正这些不负责任和投机取巧的歪风，发扬老老实实的态度，才能使我们调整公私关系的伟大工程，继续往前推进，获得更大的胜利。
