　　The "General Rules for the Organization of People's Courts" were passed by the 41st Government Affairs Conference of the Government Administration Council and submitted to the Chairman of the Central People's Government, approved by Chairman Mao on July 19th, and are hereby promulgated for implementation.

　　This order.

　　                                                     Premier Zhou Enlai
　　                                                                                      July 20, 1950

    General Rules for the Organization of People's Courts
    (Passed by the 41st Government Affairs Conference of the Government Administration Council on July 14, 1950, submitted to the Chairman of the Central People's Government for approval, and promulgated for implementation on July 19.)

    1. In order to safeguard revolutionary order and the implementation of the land reform policies and decrees of the People's Government, the provincial and higher-level people's governments may, depending on the circumstances, issue orders to establish or approve the establishment of county (city) people's courts. Their task is to use judicial procedures to punish bullies, bandits, special agents, counter-revolutionaries, and criminals who violate land reform laws, who endanger the interests of the people and the state, plot riots, and disrupt social order, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and smoothly complete land reform. In addition, disputes over the division of class components and other cases related to land reform shall also be handled by the people's courts. When the tasks of the people's court are completed and there is no need for its existence, it shall be abolished by order of the provincial and higher-level people's governments.

    2. People's courts shall be established on a county (city) basis. When necessary, branch courts may be established on a district basis or by combining two or more districts. County (city) people's courts and their branch courts may conduct circuit trials.

    3. County (city) people's courts and their branch courts are directly under the leadership of the county (city) people's government, and at the same time are a component part of the county (city) people's court. Their nature is that of a special court of the county (city) people's court, separate from the civil and criminal divisions. Ordinary civil and criminal cases are still handled by the civil and criminal divisions.

    4. County (city) people's courts and their branch courts shall all establish a trial committee, composed of a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a number of judges. The chief and deputy chief judges and half of the judges of the county (city) people's court shall be selected by the county (city) people's government, and the remaining half of the judges shall be elected by the county (city) people's representative conference or people's organizations. The chief and deputy chief judges and half of the judges of the branch court shall be selected by the county (city) people's government, and the remaining half of the judges shall be elected by the people's representative conference or people's organizations in the established area (mainly farmers' representative conferences or farmers' associations in rural areas). The chief and deputy chief judges and judges shall be reported by the county (city) people's government to the directly superior people's government for review and appointment.

    5. After accepting a case, county (city) people's courts and their branch courts shall conscientiously investigate evidence and study the case, and strictly prohibit torture. During the trial, those who are allowed to attend the hearing may speak after being permitted, but must maintain order in the court.

    6. County (city) people's courts and their branch courts shall, during trials, guarantee the defendant's right to defend himself and to ask someone to defend him, but the defender requested by the defendant must be approved by the court before he can appear in court to defend.

    7. County (city) people's courts and their branch courts have the power to arrest, detain, and sentence defendants to death, imprisonment, confiscation of property, labor service, public repentance, or declare them not guilty.

    The power to approve death sentences, confiscation of property, and imprisonment of more than five years sentenced by county people's courts and their branch courts belongs to the provincial people's government (or the commissioner's office specially designated by the provincial people's government). Death sentences shall be executed by order of the chairman of the provincial people's government (or the commissioner specially designated by the provincial people's government). The power to approve sentences of less than five years of imprisonment and acquittals belongs to the county people's government.

    The power to approve the judgments of city people's courts and their branch courts: for cities directly under the central government of the Great Administrative Area, the power of approval belonging to the provincial people's government as stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be exercised by the people's government (military and political committee) of the Great Administrative Area, and the death penalty shall be executed by order of the chairman of the people's government (military and political committee) of the Great Administrative Area; for cities under the jurisdiction of the province, the provisions of the county shall apply.

    8. The death sentences of bandits, special agents, and counter-revolutionaries sentenced by county (city) people's courts and their branch courts shall be approved and executed in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of these General Rules and shall not be appealed.

    In cases of disputes over the division of class components in land reform by county (city) people's courts and their branch courts, the judgment shall be executed immediately after the judgment is made in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 31 of the Land Reform Law.

    If the defendant or plaintiff disagrees with other judgments of the county (city) people's court and its branch courts, he may, within ten days after the judgment, request the county (city) people's government to instruct the county (city) people's court to review the case; if he still disagrees with the review judgment, he may file an appeal.

    9. If any personnel of the county (city) people's court and its branch courts commit illegal or derelict acts, the people may present evidence to report them, and if the facts are verified, the county (city) people's government or the directly superior people's government shall severely punish them according to law.

    10. The chief and deputy chief judges and judges of the county (city) people's court and its branch courts shall recuse themselves from cases in which they have a personal interest.

    11. Other staff of the county (city) people's court and its branch courts shall be transferred from the staff of the county (city) people's government, people's court, and people's organizations.

    12. The expenses of the county (city) people's court and its branch courts shall be separately stipulated by the Government Administration Council.

    13. In order to adapt to local conditions, each Great Administrative Area or province may formulate regulations for people's courts based on these General Rules, promulgate them for implementation, and report them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for record. If regulations for people's courts have been formulated before the promulgation of these General Rules, any inconsistencies with these General Rules must be amended in accordance with these General Rules.

    14. These General Rules shall be promulgated for implementation after being passed by the Government Affairs Conference of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and submitted to the Chairman of the Central People's Government for approval.

    五、县（市）人民法庭及其分庭受理案件后，应认真地进行调查证据，研究案情，严禁刑讯。在审判时，旁听的人经允许后可以发言，但必须保持法庭的秩序。
    六、县（市）人民法庭及其分庭审判时，应保障被告有辩护及请人辩护的权利，但被告所请之辩护人，须经法庭认可后，方得出庭辩护。

    县人民法庭及其分庭所判决之死刑、没收财产及五年以上徒刑的批准权，属于省人民政府（或省人民政府特令指定之专员公署），死刑由省人民政府主席（或省人民政府特令指定之专员）以命令执行之。不足五年的徒刑及宣告无罪之判决的批准权，属于县人民政府。

    县（市）人民法庭及其分庭关于土地改革中划分阶级成份的争执案件，依土地改革法第三十一条规定之手续，判决后即须执行。
    县（市）人民法庭及其分庭之其他的判决，被告或原告如有不服时，得于判决后十日内，要求县（市）人民政府指令县（市）人民法庭复审；对复审之判决如仍不服时，得提出上诉。
    九、县（市）人民法庭及其分庭的人员，如有违法渎职情事，人民得举出证据检举之，经查明属实后，由县（市）人民政府或报请直属上级人民政府依法严惩。
    十、县（市）人民法庭及其分庭之正副审判长、审判员，遇到与其本身有利害关系之案件，应行回避。
    十一、县（市）人民法庭及其分庭的其他工作人员由县（市）人民政府、人民法院及人民团体工作人员中调用之。
