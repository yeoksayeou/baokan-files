Hunyuan Rectifies Cadre Study
    Leading Cadres First Conduct Self-Criticism and Take the Lead in Studying, Overcoming the Sluggish Phenomenon of Not Valuing Study
    [Our Newspaper, Chahar Hunyuan News] After rectification, the cadre study in Hunyuan County-level organs has begun to get on the right track. In rectifying the study, the county first focused on opening up cadres' minds and correcting their attitude towards study. This was an arduous and difficult task. Due to the long-term influence of guerrilla habits and empiricism, many cadres were not serious enough about study. They didn't take notes during meetings, didn't speak during discussions, and didn't use their brains. After meetings, they were not active or proactive in implementing resolutions. They only moved when pushed; if not pushed, they wouldn't move. This was the case at the beginning of this rectification of study. The Hunyuan County Party Committee made the first mobilization, but there was no improvement. Some cadres thought, "Isn't it just the same old stuff, just rehashing the same old arguments?" When asked to conduct self-criticism, they didn't; when asked to think of solutions, they didn't. Later, after the County Party Committee repeatedly explained and mobilized, "shouting loudly," everyone was awakened. In particular, some leading cadres first made profound self-criticism, which had a great impact on everyone. After the study began, leading cadres took the lead in grasping the study. The Secretary of the County Party Committee participated in every collective study and spoke actively. The County Head also personally participated in the study and urged and checked everyone's study. As a result, other cadres also lost their excuses for not participating in the study and gradually changed the phenomenon of not valuing study and not speaking in discussions, creating a high tide of study. Secondly, the county paid attention to the grouping of studies. Through self-reporting and public discussion, and review by the leadership, all cadres were assigned to appropriate groups. At the same time, study group leaders were carefully selected, and the group leaders were responsible for understanding the study situation of their group, strictly implementing the leave and return system, and registering and counting the number of attendees every day. The organs also made appropriate preparations for the cadres' study books, utensils, and study locations. These also had a good influence on everyone's study.
    After this rectification, all organs have formulated study plans, and all cadres have also formulated individual study plans; and uniform work and rest hours have been stipulated. Everyone's work, life, and study are more intense than before. They have achieved two hours of theoretical study or cultural study every day. Everyone's morale is very high. Cadres participating in theoretical study engage in collective self-study every morning by organ or group, followed by a chat every three or five days, and a discussion every seven or ten days. Cadres participating in cultural study all attend spare-time elementary schools. The elementary schools are divided into four classes: advanced, primary, etc., and first concentrate on learning Mandarin Chinese and arithmetic. Half-monthly tests, monthly exams, quarterly exams, promotion, retention, and demotion systems are also stipulated.

　　浑源整顿干部学习
    领导干部首先检讨并带头学习  克服了不重视学习的疲蹋现象
    【本报察哈尔浑源讯】浑源县级各机关的干部学习，经过整顿之后，已开始走上正轨。在整顿学习中，该县首先注意打通干部思想，端正学习态度。这是一项繁重艰难的工作。由于长期的游击习气与经验主义的影响，许多干部对学习都不够认真。开会时不作笔记，讨论时不发言，不用脑筋。会后执行决议不积极，不主动。推一下动一下，不推就不动了。这次整顿学习开始时也是如此，中共县委作了第一次动员，毫无起色。有些干部认为“还不是那么一套，老生常谈”。叫检讨不检讨，叫想办法不想办法。后来经县委再三解释动员，“大声大叫”，惊醒大家。特别是一些领导干部首先作深刻的检讨，对大家影响很大。学习开始后，领导干部首先抓紧学习。中共县委书记参加每次的集体学习，并积极发言。县长也亲自参加学习，并督促检查大家的学习。因之，其他干部也消失了不参加学习的借口，逐渐转变了不重视学习与在讨论中不发言的现象。造成了学习的高潮。其次该县注意了学习的编组，以自报公议，由领导上审查的方法，把各干部都编在适宜的组里。同时慎选学习小组长，由小组长掌握本组学习情况，严格执行请假、销假制度，登记统计每天出席人数。机关对干部学习的书籍、用具、学习地点等，也作了适当的准备。这些对大家的学习也有好的影响。
    经过此次整顿，各机关都订了学习计划，各干部也订了个人学习计划；并统一规定了作息时间。大家的工作、生活和学习都较前紧张。每天作到了坚持两小时的理论学习或文化学习。大家情绪很高。参加理论学习的干部是以机关或小组为单位每天早上集体自修，三天或五天漫谈一次，七天或十天讨论一次。参加文化学习的干部则一律上业余完小。完小分高、初级四个班，首先集中力量学国语和算术。并规定了半月测验、月考、季考和升、留、降级等制度。
