　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th: The Korean Central News Agency, Pyongyang, July 24th, reported: People's guerrillas in various parts of South Korea, with the active support of residents, are striking at the enemy. Guerrillas in the Gyeongsangbuk-do area on the 22nd launched a surprise attack on the Gimcheon defense line, which the enemy was preparing to salvage their defeat in Daejeon. The enemy was caught off guard and thrown into chaos. On the same day, guerrillas operating in Gyeongsangnam-do attacked Danseong-myeon in Sancheong County, cutting off the telegraph and telephone lines of the puppet army and police, and then engaged in fierce fighting with the puppet army and police, inflicting heavy blows on them and seizing many weapons. After completing their mission, the guerrillas calmly returned to their base. Guerrillas in the three counties of Geochang, Hamyang, and Hapcheon, and Jinju City in northwestern Gyeongsangnam-do, all mobilized on the 22nd to wipe out the puppet police lurking in the area and wiped out Syngman Rhee's special agent organization, the "Great Korean Youth Corps".
    Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Central News Agency reporter Zeng Enbo, in a telegram sent on the 21st from the so-called "Korean Cleveland Air Force Base," admitted that the activity of the South Korean People's Guerrillas was making the American invaders very embarrassed. He said: This air base "is actually in the backyard of the guerrillas. The guerrillas are active in the mountains near this air base, only a few thousand yards from the airport. Since the base began operations ten days ago, the guerrillas have launched three surprise attacks on the temporary earthen runway. The defenders can only fire rows of machine guns into the darkness at the invisible guerrillas. After firing a few shots, the guerrillas ran away to watch the fun." (Picture attached)

　　南朝鲜游击队积极打击敌人
    奇袭金泉防线并不断袭击美空军基地
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】朝鲜中央通讯社平壤二十四日讯：南朝鲜各地的人民游击队，正在居民的积极支持下，打击敌人。庆尚北道方面的游击队二十二日奇袭了敌人为挽救大田的失败而准备的金泉防线。敌人因遭意外袭击而惊惶失措，乱成一团。同日，活动在庆尚南道的游击队，攻入山清县丹城区，在截断伪军警的电报电话线后，与伪军警展开激战，予以沉重打击，缴获武器甚多。游击队在完成任务后，从容地转回到自己的根据地。在庆尚南道西北部的居昌、咸阳、陕川三县与晋州市等地的游击队，二十二日全体出动，肃清了潜伏在该地的伪警察，并将李承晚的特务组织“大韩青年团”一网打尽。
    【新华社二十六日讯】国民党中央社记者曾恩波二十一日自所谓“韩国克利夫兰空军基地”发出的电讯中，承认南朝鲜人民游击队的活跃，使得美国侵略者十分狼狈。他说：这个空军基地“实际上就在游击队的后院里。游击队在这个空军基地附近的山间出没，离机场不过数千码，自从十天以前这个基地开始活动以来，游击队曾三度偷袭由泥土临时铺成的跑道，守军只能朝黑暗的地方，向无法看见的游击队成排的以机关枪射击。游击队放了几枪后，便跑开去看热闹。”（附图片）
