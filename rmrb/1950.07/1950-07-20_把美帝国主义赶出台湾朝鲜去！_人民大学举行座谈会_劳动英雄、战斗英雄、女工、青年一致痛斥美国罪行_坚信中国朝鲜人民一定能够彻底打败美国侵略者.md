　　Drive the American Imperialists Out of Taiwan and Korea!
    People's University Holds Symposium
    Labor Heroes, Combat Heroes, Female Workers, and Youths Unanimously Denounce American Crimes
    Firmly Believe that the Chinese and Korean People Will Thoroughly Defeat the American Aggressors
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The students of the People's University are closely watching the shameless crimes of American imperialism directly attacking the Korean people, invading our territory of Taiwan, and interfering in the liberation struggles of the Vietnamese and Filipino people. On the evening of July 18th, at a symposium hosted by the Student Union on the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, labor heroes, combat heroes, meritorious individuals who had been awarded two major merits, veterans of the 25,000-li Long March, guerrillas from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, revolutionary mothers who had struggled for twelve years, students from the Mongolian ethnic group, representatives of the Student Union, youth workers, and two Korean youths all firmly and unanimously opposed the shameless acts of aggression by American imperialism and the illegal resolutions of the United Nations Security Council controlled by the United States, and warmly sympathized with and supported the just liberation war of the Korean people. Furthermore, they expressed that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and will surely shatter this lame paper tiger of American imperialism.
            We Must Liberate Taiwan
    Comrade Ren Xianzhi, who received a special award from Commander-in-Chief Zhu during the Long March and was a labor hero in the reclamation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and a second-class hero in the Battle of Siping, said, based on his experience of fighting imperialism and its running dogs for over 20 years: "American imperialism, this paper tiger, is nothing to be afraid of. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we used one hand to fight imperialism and the other to guard against domestic enemies, and we achieved victory. In the three-year People's Liberation War, we defeated Chiang Kai-shek with the help of American imperialism. Today, American imperialism is already in a disheveled state of affairs; we are even less afraid of it, and we will definitely liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people's decades of experience are like this: imperialism and reactionaries are the same; if you don't strike them, they will bully you."
    Comrade Chen Rangshan, who was once a guerrilla captain in the War of Resistance Against Japan and a battalion commander in the People's Liberation Army, recalled that in 1945, five Americans and Kuomintang secret agents conspired to operate in the marginal areas of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. After they landed from a plane, six farmers captured them with hoes. He said: "American imperialism, this paper tiger, is vulnerable. Their army is afraid of fighting and has no strength."
    Comrade Li Rongchun joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at the age of fourteen and was a soldier who participated in the 25,000-li Long March. He has been selected as a representative to attend the World Student Congress. He said: "American imperialism is even more fiercely sending troops to invade Korea and Taiwan. Its rampancy is because it is nearing its end. The Chinese and Korean people have a deep understanding of imperialism. The Chinese people fought for over a hundred years and finally overthrew the rule of imperialism and its running dogs in China. Under the previous conditions, we could cross the Yangtze River, so today, crossing a strait will not be a problem. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate it!"
            Drive the American Imperialists Out of Korea
    Comrade Yu Baohe, an old guerrilla from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, fought alongside Korean guerrillas in the struggle against the Japanese invaders. Recalling the past struggle, he said: "In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of American imperialism, attacked us. At that time, the enemy advanced, and we retreated. The apparent strength was also that the enemy was strong and we were weak. But we are waging a just war, which determines the victory of the war. The American imperialist invasion of Korea is an unjust war. People all over the world oppose it. The international situation is favorable to the Korean people. The Korean people have the strength to achieve victory. The victory of the Korean people is the victory of the world's peace and democracy camp, because our enemies are common. We must support the Korean people's war of liberation."
    Comrade Li Caihai, who worked as a worker in an arsenal for eight years, recalled his struggle life and said: The most ferocious German fascists were defeated, Japanese imperialism surrendered, and American imperialism has already suffered a crushing defeat in China. This time, the American imperialists have come to invade Taiwan and Korea again, which means they "haven't suffered enough and still want to suffer more"!
    Comrade Qi'erhatu from the Mongolian ethnic group said: "During the People's Liberation War, the Mongolian and Han ethnic groups fought side by side and achieved today's victory. The path of the Chinese people's victory is the path of the Korean people; Li Chengwan's path is the path of Chiang Kai-shek. The Korean nation will surely achieve the unification of the motherland. The Korean people will surely be able to drive the American imperialists out of Korea."
            Victory Belongs to Us
    Li Longyun, a Korean student studying in China, said with emotion: "Since the Korean people's war began, the students and Chinese people I know have been as concerned about the victory of Korea as they are about China. We are very grateful. When I heard the news of the Korean War, I was extremely angry! This time, Li Chengwan launched the civil war entirely with American support, and American imperialists have openly invaded Korean territory. But we have confidence in victory, and victory belongs to us! Today's Korea is different from when Japan invaded. It is not isolated. It stands with the strength of the people all over the world, and with the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union!" He said: "If the American imperialists continue to attack, I plan to go back to participate in the war in my motherland, defeat the American imperialists, and then come back to study." Wu Jingjun is also a Korean student. He said: "I have been oppressed by imperialism since I was a child. In the past, Japanese imperialism forced us to speak Japanese, change our names, and were not allowed to read Korean history, completely obliterating the independence of the Korean people. My father was arrested and imprisoned for the independence of the Korean nation. Why shouldn't we oppose imperialism? We are the children of the proletariat, and we must unite with the people all over the world, drive the American imperialists out of Korea, and finally, victory will be ours!"
            Express the Desire for Peace with Action
    Jin Xiuling, a representative attending the World Student Congress, was once a female worker at the Beijing Clothing Factory. She suffered all kinds of torture under the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries and personally experienced days of hunger and the whippings of the Japanese devils. Therefore, she cherishes today's life and hates the aggressive behavior of imperialism. She said: "We firmly support the Korean people's liberation struggle, expand the peace signature movement, and consolidate peace. This time, when I go to Prague, I will expose the conspiracies of imperialism to the youth of various countries and introduce the experience of the victory of the Chinese revolution. When I come back, I will study hard and strive for the complete victory of the Chinese people."
    Comrade Shi Haijun, who worked as an electrician for six years, also personally experienced the persecution of the Chinese people by imperialism. He said: "The people harbor all kinds of hatred for imperialism and the reactionaries. Chairman Mao liberated us. We must express the desire for peace with action and earnestly study various knowledge to build the motherland. The stronger the construction of the new China, the more it increases the strength of peace, and the more the American imperialists will not dare to launch a new war."
    Comrade Ruan Yi, a female factory worker with six years of seniority, said: "For the sake of victory, I myself must strengthen my studies, overcome difficulties, and complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party." Comrade Feng, a mother who has been participating in the revolution for twelve years, thought of her past days. She said: "I realize that as long as we have firm confidence and recognize the direction, we can win. I am old, and I want to educate my children to establish such correct thinking. Communist Party members must first strengthen themselves in order to win the victory of world peace." The comrades finally unanimously stated: We must support the Korean people's liberation struggle by liberating Taiwan. We must strengthen propaganda and smash the conspiracies of secret agents. More importantly, we must strengthen our studies and complete the tasks given to us by the people. Long live the unbreakable unity of the Chinese and Korean people!

　　把美帝国主义赶出台湾朝鲜去！
    人民大学举行座谈会
    劳动英雄、战斗英雄、女工、青年一致痛斥美国罪行 
    坚信中国朝鲜人民一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者
    【本报讯】中国人民大学的同学们，都在密切地注视着美国帝国主义直接进攻朝鲜人民，侵略我国领土台湾，干涉越南和菲律宾人民解放斗争的无耻罪行。七月十八日晚上，在学生会所主持的反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动的座谈会上，劳动英雄、战斗英雄们，立过两次大功的功臣，经过二万五千里长征的老战士，东北抗日联军的游击队员，斗争了十二年的革命母亲，蒙古民族的同学，学生会代表，青年工作者，还有两位朝鲜青年，都坚决一致地反对美帝国主义的无耻的侵略罪行，反对美国所把持的联合国安理会的非法决议，热诚地同情并声援朝鲜人民正义的解放战争。并且表示，中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定能够打碎美帝国主义这只跛了脚的纸老虎。
            我们一定要解放台湾
    任先智同学，曾经在长征中得过朱总司令的特奖，是陕甘宁边区开荒的劳动英雄，四平街战斗中的二等英雄。他根据他和帝国主义及其走狗战斗了二十多年的经验说：“美帝国主义这只纸老虎没什么可怕。我们在抗日战争中，是一只手对付帝国主义，一只手提防国内的敌人，取得了胜利的。在三年人民解放战争中，我们打垮了在美帝国主义帮助下的蒋介石。今天美帝国主义已经是一付歪戴帽子斜穿衣的狼狈样子，我们更不怕他了，我们一定解放台湾。中国人民几十年的经验是这样：帝国主义和反动派，都一样，你不打击他，他就欺侮你。”
    曾是抗日战争的游击队长、人民解放军的营长的陈让山同学回忆在一九四五年曾有五个美国人和国民党特务，阴谋在晋察冀边缘区活动，当他们在飞机上降落到地下后，六个农民用锄头就俘虏了他们。他说：“美帝国主义这只纸老虎是不堪一击的，他们的军队害怕打仗，是没有力量的。”
    李荣春同学是十四岁参加中国工农红军，经过二万五千里长征的战士。这次已经被选为出席世界学生代表大会的代表。他说：“美帝更加凶猛的出兵侵略朝鲜、侵略台湾，他的猖狂是因为他快到死亡的时候了。中国人民和朝鲜人民对帝国主义的了解是很深刻的。中国人民战斗了一百多年，终于打垮了帝国主义及其走狗在中国的统治。在从前的条件下，我们可以渡过长江，那么今天，渡过一个海峡也不会成问题。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放它！”
            把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜去
    东北抗日联军的老游击队员于保合同学，曾经在反对日寇斗争中和朝鲜的游击队并肩作战。他回忆起过去的斗争，说：“一九四六年蒋介石在美帝国主义帮助下进攻我们，当时是敌进我退，表面上的力量也是敌强我弱。但我们是正义的战争，这决定了战争的胜利。美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争是非正义的，世界人民都反对它，国际形势是对朝鲜人民有利的，朝鲜人民有力量取得胜利。朝鲜人民的胜利就是世界和平民主阵营的胜利，因为我们的敌人是共同的，我们要声援朝鲜人民的解放战争。”
    作过八年兵工工人的李才海同学回忆起他的斗争生活后说：最凶恶的德国法西斯被打败了，日本帝国主义投降了，美帝国主义已经在中国遭到惨败。这次美帝又来侵略台湾朝鲜，是“苦头没吃够，还要吃苦头”！
    蒙古族同学其额尔哈图说：“在人民解放战争中蒙汉民族并肩作战，取得了今天的胜利。中国人民胜利的道路，就是朝鲜人民的道路；李承晚的道路就是蒋介石的道路。朝鲜民族一定会得到祖国的统一。朝鲜人民一定能把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜去。”
            胜利是属于我们的
    朝鲜留华学生李龙云感动地说：“自从朝鲜人民的战争开始，同学们和我所熟悉的中国人都像关心中国一样关心朝鲜的胜利，我们心里很感激。当我听到朝鲜战争的消息，我愤怒到极点了！这次李承晚发动内战完全是在美国支持下进行的，而且美帝国主义者已公开地侵犯朝鲜的国土。但我们有胜利的信心，胜利是属于我们的！现在的朝鲜和日本侵略的时候不同了，它不是孤立的，它和全世界人民的力量站在一起，和中苏两大民族站在一起！”他表示：“如果美帝继续进攻，我打算回去参加祖国的战争，打垮了美帝国主义再来学习。”吴景俊也是朝鲜籍的同学。他说：“我从小就受帝国主义压迫。过去日本帝国主义逼我们说日本话，改姓名，不准读朝鲜历史，完全抹煞了朝鲜人民的独立。我的父亲为了朝鲜民族的独立曾被捕坐监。我们为什么不反对帝国主义呢？我们是无产阶级的儿女，我们一定和全世界人民团结在一起，把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜去，最后胜利是我们的！”
            用行动来表现和平的愿望
    这次出席世界学生代表大会的代表金秀玲，曾是北京被服厂的女工。她在日寇和国民党反动统治下曾受尽了折磨，亲自体验过饥饿的日子和日本鬼子的鞭挞。因此她珍爱今天的生活，痛恨帝国主义的侵略行为。她说：“我们坚决支持朝鲜人民的解放斗争，扩大和平签名运动，巩固和平。我这次到布拉格去，要向各国青年揭露帝国主义的阴谋，介绍中国革命胜利的经验。回来要好好学习，争取中国人民的彻底胜利。”
    作过七、八年电机工人的石海君同学也曾亲身经历过帝国主义对中国人民的迫害。他说：“人民对帝国主义和反动派存在着百般仇恨，毛主席解放了我们。我们要用行动表现和平的愿望，认真学习建设祖国的各种知识。新中国建设的愈强大，就愈增加和平的力量，美帝国主义者就愈不敢发动新的战争了。”
    六年工龄的工厂女工阮懿同学说：“为了胜利，我自己要加强学习，克服困难，完成党给我的任务。”参加革命已十二年的妈妈冯同学想到她过去的日子。她说：“我认识到只要坚定信心、认清方向，就能够胜利。我年纪大了，我要教育我的孩子们树立这样正确的思想，共产党员必须先坚定自己，才能争取到世界和平的胜利。”同学们最后一致表示：我们要以解放台湾来支援朝鲜人民的解放斗争。要加强宣传，粉碎特务的阴谋活动。更重要的是加强学习，完成人民所给予我们的任务。牢不可破的中朝人民团结万岁！
