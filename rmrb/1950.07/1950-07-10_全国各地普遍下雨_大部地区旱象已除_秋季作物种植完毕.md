Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Since mid-June, widespread rainfall has occurred across the country, which is of great benefit to farmers for rice transplanting and planting late autumn crops. Currently, except for individual areas experiencing drought or flooding, most areas have even rainfall, and autumn crops have been planted.

Since the beginning of summer, various regions suffered from drought due to a lack of rainfall. In Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China, before mid-June, in only nine counties, including Tai'an and Hailun, more than 510,000 mu of farmland could not be sown due to water shortage. In East China, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and other places generally suffered from severe drought before mid-June. For example, in the northern Anhui area, 20% of the paddy fields could not be transplanted at that time, and dryland crops could not be sown due to the land being too dry. In the Central South region, in Hubei Province, in the area along the north bank of the Yangtze River near the Dabie Mountains and Dahong Mountains, with a population of approximately 5 million, a serious drought also occurred during the same period. The drought also caused or expanded insect pests. For example, locust plagues occurred in Sihong County in northern Anhui due to the drought; Shandong, Zhejiang, and other places also experienced increased insect pest outbreaks due to the drought.

After mid-June, widespread rainfall began in various regions. Heilongjiang Province received rain twice in mid-June, and rainfall was sufficient in all but Xunke County. In Shandong Province, heavy rains fell in most areas on June 17th, 18th, and 22nd, thoroughly soaking the land. In northern Jiangsu, rainfall reached 43 millimeters in several days from June 14th to 23rd. During the same period, southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places received sufficient rainfall. Farmers in various regions who had been suffering from drought were extremely pleased. People's governments and Communist Party organizations at all levels also seized the opportunity to lead farmers in transplanting rice seedlings, replanting, and planting late autumn crops. The County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Lincheng and Huashan (a newly established county formed by the combination of southern Fengxian, northwestern Pei County, and northeastern Dangshan) in Shandong Province sent a large number of cadres to various districts after the rain to help farmers with emergency planting. The People's Administrative Office of southern Anhui immediately allocated 740,000 jin of miscellaneous grain seeds after the rain to lend to poor farmers in various places for sowing.

Through the active replanting led by the people's governments in various regions, the autumn crops in various regions have now been planted. Except for individual areas, the drought in various regions has been relieved, and the amount of water in the farmland is relatively even.

### 全国各地普遍下雨  大部地区旱象已除  秋季作物种植完毕

　　全国各地普遍下雨
    大部地区旱象已除  秋季作物种植完毕
    【新华社九日讯】自六月中旬以来，全国各地普遍下雨，这对于农民插秧和种植晚秋作物，有很大益处。现在全国除个别地区发生旱灾或水灾外，大部地区雨水均匀，秋季作物都已种植完毕。
    入夏以来，各地曾因缺少雨水，一度普呈旱象。东北黑龙江省在六月中旬以前，仅泰安、海伦等九个县，即有五十一万余亩农田因缺水而无法播种。华东的山东、苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南、浙江等地，在六月中旬以前，普遍苦旱。其中如皖北区，当时全区有百分之二十的水田无法插秧，旱地作物也因土地过于干燥而无法下种。中南区的湖北省长江北岸沿大别山、大洪山约五百万人口的地区，也于同期间内发生了严重旱象。天旱又引起了或扩大了虫害，如皖北区泗洪县因天旱而发生了蝗灾；山东、浙江等地也因天旱而助长了虫害的蔓延。
    六月中旬以后，各地开始普遍下雨。黑龙江省在六月中旬两次获雨，全省除逊克一县外，雨水已告充足。山东省在六月十七、十八、二十二三天内普降大雨，大部地区都已湿透。苏北各地自六月十四日至二十三日数天内，降雨量达四十三公厘。在同时期内，苏南、皖北、皖南、浙江、湖北、江西等地都获得充足的雨量。久旱得雨的各地农民们都欣喜异常。各地人民政府和共产党的组织也都抓紧时机，领导农民插秧补苗，种植晚秋作物。山东省临城、华山（丰县南部、沛县西北部、砀山东北合组之新设县）等县中共县委在雨后即派出大批干部分赴所属各区，帮助农民进行抢种。皖南区人民行署于雨后即拨出杂粮种子七十四万斤，贷给各地贫苦农民播种。
    经过各地人民政府领导农民积极抢种，各地的秋季作物现已种植完毕。除个别地区外，目前各地的旱象已除，农田水量尚称均匀。
