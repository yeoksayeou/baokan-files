　　Dalian Far East Electric Industry
    Cement Plant Union Faces Production
    By our reporter Jian Qing

    The Dalian Far East Electric Industry Cement Plant has over 1,100 workers. Only the union chairman and union secretary are union cadres detached from production. They organized active elements among the masses into ten committees to take charge of various tasks, doing a very good job of union work and powerfully promoting production. Comrade Li Lisan, in his "Several Explanations on the Draft of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China," referred to the factory's union as a model grassroots organization.

    Last year, the factory's output exceeded the annual target by 192%, costs were reduced by 30%, and quality continuously improved. Building on last year's production, the factory carried out three major repair projects this spring, improving the production efficiency of old machines. In April, it completed 195% of its target, setting a new monthly production record since the factory was established. Production continued to rise in May, completing 201% of the target, and in June, 210% of the target. It is projected that the annual target can be completed by the end of August this year. The emergence of the above brilliant achievements is inseparable from the union's full mobilization and leadership of workers to actively produce.

            A Detour

    The factory union's formation of the idea of leading production took a detour. In the first half of 1948, the factory's production was abnormal, workers faced many difficulties in their lives, and morale was low. At that time, the union's work policy deviated, merely circling around welfare issues. It was not until October of the same year that the union gradually clarified the policy of facing production through exploration, and at the same time, put forward the slogan "Everyone runs the union." According to work needs, they established ten committees for organization, production, technology, labor protection, evaluation, hygiene, learning, and safety, respectively, coordinating their work while ensuring production.

            Seize the Production Plan

    Turning the administrative production plan into the masses' fighting goal is the key to ensuring the completion of the production task. When workers know the production plan, they have a clear understanding, and they have a goal when working, so efficiency is high. At the end of each month, the factory administration informs the union of the production plan for the following month, which is first discussed by the union committee to determine the union's guarantee plan. Each union committee then formulates a specific plan based on the union's overall plan. On the 3rd of each month, a joint meeting of group leaders from all workshops in the factory is held to deploy the production guarantee work for the month, and then the group leaders convene group meetings to convey and discuss how the group will ensure the completion of the administrative and union plans, and formulate the group's production plan. Because the workers' wisdom and enthusiasm are fully utilized through discussions, the production tasks are often completed ahead of schedule and above the target. For example, the connection between the generator drainage pipe and the water kiosk in the factory was suddenly blocked. If it was not repaired urgently, the entire factory would have to stop production, and stopping production for one day would result in 700 tons less cement production. To this end, the administration proposed an emergency repair, originally planned to be completed in five days, but after discussion by the workers, it was completed in two and a half days.

        Mastering Production Situation and Solving Production Problems

    In order to guarantee the completion of the production task, the factory union established a system of group daily reports, meeting records, workshop production meetings, rationalization proposals, and requests for approval. The union production committee uses group daily reports to understand the production situation in each workshop. For example, from April 12th to 19th, the daily cement production exceeded 700 tons, but on April 20th, it suddenly dropped to 678 tons, and then continued to decline. Therefore, the production committee promptly studied with the cement workplace group and the administration, and found that the main reason for the decline in output was that the calcination yard could not supply materials; further research improved the firing technology, thus restoring production to normal, and as a result, the April task was overfulfilled. The union committees also often go deep into the workshops to actively discover and solve problems. For example, in the past, loading and unloading workers were paid by the carload. When unloading, because it was difficult to unload high-sided cars, everyone rushed to unload hopper cars, and disputes often occurred among the workers. After the production committee discovered this, it proposed a discussion at the production meeting, and suggested that the administration implement collective contract unloading, which eliminated the phenomenon of disunity among workers due to disputes. The union proposed the following requirements for the work style of each committee member: "busy mouth" -- more publicity and more urging; "busy feet" -- more in-depth contact with workshops and the masses; "busy eyes" -- more discovery of problems; "busy ears" -- more listening to the feedback of the masses, to replace meetings that are indecisive and resolutions that are not implemented, to get rid of bureaucracy, and to actively delve into and solve problems.

            Organize Workshop Production Meetings

    The workshop production meeting is a working method for the union to organize the masses to carry out production. The meeting is convened by the director of the workshop committee and attended by production cadres of each union group, advanced production workers, and member technicians. Through criticism and self-criticism, the masses are mobilized to actively participate in production, the progress of production work is checked, methods for improving production are studied, and suggestions are made to the administration. Since the factory implemented the workshop production meeting in November last year, the meeting has improved the organization of labor, discussed the connection and guarantee conditions between processes, and established contact contracts, so that various departments can cooperate organically. Strict inspection system has also been established. Through the workshop production meeting, the excess reward system based on the field was changed to the excess reward system based on the shift, so that the responsibilities of each shift are clear and the rewards are reasonable. For example, after the clay workplace discussed the shift reward standard at the production meeting, it also raised the issue of the connection and responsibility system between shifts, setting off a competition between shifts. The workshop production meeting should have sufficient preparation in advance, and the meeting should solve problems in a targeted and orderly manner. The relevant suggestions to the administration should be quickly transferred according to the results of the meeting. If it cannot be resolved, it should be explained in detail to the workers, and should not be backlogged and delayed, so as not to reduce the enthusiasm of the workers.

    洋灰厂工会面向生产
    本报记者  剑清
    大连远东电业洋灰工厂有一千一百多工人，工会中脱离生产的干部只有工会主席和工会秘书两人。他们把群众中的积极分子组成十个委员会，分担各项工作，把工会工作做得很好，有力地推进了生产。李立三同志在“关于中华人民共和国工会法草案的几点说明”中，把该厂工会称为模范的基层组织。
    该厂去年产量超过全年任务的百分之一百九十二，成本降低了百分之三十，质量也不断提高。在去年的生产基础上，今年春季该厂已进行了三项巨大的修理工程，使陈旧的机器提高了生产效能，四月份即完成了任务的百分之一百九十五，创该厂建厂以来的最高月产量。五月份产量继续上升，完成任务的百分之二百零一；六月份完成任务的百分之二百一十。预定在今年八月底即可完成全年任务。以上光辉成绩的出现，是和该厂的工会全力发动和领导工人积极生产分不开的。
            一段弯路
    该厂工会对领导生产的思想的形成，是走了一段弯路的。在一九四八年上半年，该厂生产不正常，工人生活困难多，情绪低落。当时工会工作的方针发生了偏差，只是在福利问题上打圈子。直到同年十月，从摸索中才逐渐明确了工会面向生产的方针，同时并提出了“大家办工会”的口号。他们根据工作需要，分别成立了组织、生产、技术、劳保、评议、卫生、学习、安全等十个委员会，在保证生产的前提下，互相配合进行工作。
            抓住生产计划
    把行政生产计划变为群众的奋斗目标，是保证完成生产任务的关键。工人知道了生产计划，心里有了底，工作时有目标，效率就高。每月月底，该厂行政把下月的生产计划通知工会，由工会委员会首先讨论，定出工会的保证计划。工会各委员会又根据工会总的计划，再订出具体的计划。每月三号召开全厂各车间的小组长联席会，布置本月份的生产保证工作，再由小组长召开小组会议，传达并讨论本组如何保证完成行政和工会的计划，并做出本组的生产计划。由于经过了工人的讨论，充分发挥了工人的智慧和热情，所以生产任务经常是提前超额完成。如该厂发电机排水管和水亭子连接处突被堵塞，如不紧急修理，全厂就要停工，停工一天将少生产洋灰七百吨。为此，行政上提出紧急抢修，原计划五天完成，但经工人讨论后，以两天半的时间就完成了。
        掌握生产情况解决生产问题
    为保证生产任务的完成，该厂工会建立了小组日报、会议记录、车间生产会议、合理化建议、请示批准等制度。工会生产委员会通过小组日报掌握各车间的生产情况。如自四月十二日至十九日，每天洋灰产量均超过七百吨，但四月二十日突然降至六百七十八吨，以后又陆续下降，于是生产委员会及时和洋灰职场小组及行政研究，找出产量下降的主要原因是烧成场供不上料；进一步又研究改进了烧火技术，因而使生产又恢复正常，结果四月份超额完成任务。工会各委员会还经常深入车间，主动发现并解决问题。譬如装卸工人过去是按车皮包件，卸车时因高边车卸车费工，大家都抢卸漏斗车，工人之间常发生争执。生产委员会发现后，就在生产会议上提出讨论，并建议行政实行集体包卸，这样就免除了工人之间因争执而引起不团结的现象。工会对于各委员的工作作风提出要：口勤——多宣传，多督促；脚勤——多深入车间和群众接触；眼勤——多发现问题；耳勤——多听取群众反映，以代替议而不决，决而不行的会议，摆脱事务主义，主动深入发现并解决问题。
            组织车间生产会议
    车间生产会议是工会组织群众进行生产的一种工作方法。会议由车间委员会主任召集，吸收各工会小组生产干事、先进生产工作者及会员技术人员参加。通过批评与自我批评的方式，发动群众积极参加生产，并检查生产工作进行情况，研究改进生产方法，向行政提出建议。该厂从去年十一月实行车间生产会议以来，通过会议改进了劳动组织，讨论了工序间的联系和保证条件，订立了联系合同，使各部门有机地配合起来。并订出了严格的检查制度。通过车间生产会议，改变了以场为单位的超额奖励制为按班超额奖励制，使各班职责分明，奖励合理。如粘土职场经生产会议讨论了按班奖励标准，并提出了班与班的联系与责任制问题，掀起了班与班的竞赛。车间生产会议的召开，事先应有充分的准备，会中应有目标有秩序地解决问题。应根据会议的结果，将有关对行政的建议迅速转交，如不能解决的应向工人详细解释，不得积压拖延，以免降低工人群众的积极性。
