Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th: Farmers in over a hundred counties in Northeast China, under the leadership of the People's Government, have promptly curbed the spread of insect pests since the beginning of summer. In many areas, affected crops have returned to normal, and in some counties with more severe damage, early-maturing crops were replanted in a timely manner, so the impact on this year's yield will be minimal. In Liaoxi Province, one of the areas most heavily affected by insect pests, farmers in 21 counties and cities quickly organized pest control committees after discovering the infestation, widely mobilizing men, women, young, and old to participate in catching insects. For example, in Xingcheng County, the number of farmers participating in insect catching reached over 17,000 per day during the intensive pest control week. Thanks to the active efforts of the masses of farmers, the insect infestation in most parts of the province had been brought under control by the beginning of this month. Night-feeding cutworms appeared in 29 counties and cities in Songjiang Province. After the masses of farmers universally launched pest elimination campaigns, the insect infestation in most areas has also been eliminated. For example, in Hulan County of that province, over 13,000 women and children participated in pest elimination, and pests on over 30,000 mu of sugar beets were quickly eradicated. Insect infestations in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and parts of the suburbs of Shenyang City have also been greatly reduced in severity due to the local farmers' efforts in catching insects. For example, since the end of last month, over 146,000 farmers in the Dongxiangtun District in the suburbs of Shenyang City have participated in the insect catching campaign, eliminating about one ton of night-feeding cutworms, thus relieving over 45,000 mu of crops in the entire district from the disaster of insect pests.

In the insect catching campaign, the masses of farmers have used a wide variety of insect catching methods and demonstrated a high degree of creativity. For example, farmers in Liaoxi Province created 15 new insect catching methods during the insect catching campaign, which were widely promoted throughout the province. People's governments at all levels have also distributed large quantities of insecticides and sprayers during the insect catching campaign, and organized personnel from agricultural experiment stations and agricultural technology extension teams to go to the countryside to actively assist farmers in pest control.

　　东北虫害及时制止庄稼产量影响不大
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北百余县农民在人民政府领导下，已及时地制止了入夏以来虫灾的蔓延。许多地区受害作物均已恢复常态，某些受灾较重县份经及时补种了早熟庄稼，对今年的产量影响不大。受虫灾较重的辽西省二十一个县市的农民，于发现虫害后，迅速组织了防虫委员会，广泛动员男女老幼参加捕虫。如兴城县在捕虫突击周中每天参加捕虫的农民即达一万七千余人。经过农民群众的积极捕捉，全省至本月上旬止，大部地区虫害已告扑灭。松江省二十九个县市曾发生夜盗虫，经农民群众普遍展开除虫运动后，大部地区的虫害亦已消除。如该省呼兰县有一万三千余名妇女、儿童参加除虫，三万余亩的甜菜害虫即被迅速扑灭。吉林、黑龙江等省及沈阳市郊部分地区所发生的虫害，也经当地农民捕捉后而大大减轻了为害的程度。如沈阳市郊东相屯区农民于上月底以来，即有十四万六千余人参加了捉虫运动，扑灭了夜盗虫一吨左右，使全区四万五千余亩庄稼解除了害虫的灾害。
    农民群众在捕虫运动中运用了多种多样的捕虫方法，发挥了高度的创造性。如辽西省农民在捕虫运动中创造了十五种新的捕虫办法，在全省各地普遍推广。各省人民政府在捕虫运动中也发放了大量的杀虫药剂和喷雾器，并组织农事试验场和农业技术推广队人员下乡，积极协助农民除虫。
