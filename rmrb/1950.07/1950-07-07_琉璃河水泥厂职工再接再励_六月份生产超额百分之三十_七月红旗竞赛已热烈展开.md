　　Liulihe Cement Plant Workers Make Further Efforts

    June Production Exceeds Target by 30 Percent

    July Red Flag Competition Launched Vigorously

    [Reported by this newspaper] After setting a record high since the founding of the factory in the Red May, all employees of the state-owned Liulihe Cement Plant made further efforts and overfulfilled the production plan in June, creating the highest record of production exceeding Red May, and made considerable achievements in saving raw materials and reducing costs. In June, the plant produced 12,830 tons of cement, exceeding the original plan by 31.98 percent, and exceeding the output of Red May by 23.2 percent (Red May produced 10,414.6 tons of cement); the clinker output up to June 24 was 8,140 tons, exceeding the original plan by 7 percent (the original plan stipulated that clinker production should be 24 days in June, and the 25th to 30th should be maintenance days. Red May produced 9,968 tons of clinker throughout the month). Now, in order to consolidate the existing achievements and continue to create new records, the plant launched the July Red Flag production competition from the 1st of this month to celebrate the Party's "July 1st" birthday with practical production actions.

    In June production, under the slogan of "unite and face production," all employees of the plant demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, and heroic deeds continued to emerge. For example, on June 9, more than 200 kilograms of large clinker were sintered in the No. 4 rotary kiln and could not be discharged. If it was not entered and broken out, production would be affected. In order to seize every minute and every second of production, the workers of the kiln watching shift compressed the working time allowed to enter the kiln from 24 hours to 12 hours. About 40 minutes after the kiln was shut down, Zhao Jincai, the leader of the kiln watching shift, led six workers of the whole shift, carrying wet sacks soaked in water, braved the high heat to enter the kiln to work in shifts. Each person persisted in working in the kiln for up to three minutes. At that time, the temperature in the kiln was above 1,200 degrees. Worker Yang Xiqiu was burned on his hands and feet by the broken clinker that was knocked down in the kiln, but he still insisted on completing the task. With such hard work, it only took one hour, and the No. 4 kiln was re-ignited and opened, entering normal production. The mill workers in the grinding room, if they found that the production efficiency of a certain shift was slightly lower, immediately convened a temporary meeting to study the reasons and immediately correct them. After receiving the repair and fitting plan for June, Li Wenzhong, the foreman of the turner group of the repair section, convened all the turners to study the methods of division of labor and cooperation, and challenged the fitters, riveters, carpenters, foundry workers, and crane operators of the section to jointly complete the task ahead of schedule. Turners, fitters, and riveters saved 171 man-days more than the original plan.

    In terms of saving raw materials and reducing costs, the plant used to waste oil, and saving oil was also one of the key points of the June production plan. Li Qianxiang (a party member) of the grinding room shared his experience in saving oil, and everyone learned from him, paying attention at all times during work. Not only was the machine well preserved, but also more than 200 kilograms of table oil and engine oil were saved. Yang Xiyin, the foreman of the kiln room, in the continuous production competition, cooperated with the oil pouring workers to collect 14 barrels of waste oil, each barrel containing 190 kilograms, next to the kiln table oil shaft which was running day and night. After re-frying it with fire, it can be used on slow shafts, gears with low speed, and pulleys, saving 53,200 jin of millet. The grinding room also collected six barrels of waste oil in the same way. Zhao Fushun and other workers in the clay room used their spare time to select and screen out more than 100 baskets of combustible coke from the charcoal ash filled in the ditches during the enemy and puppet period.

　　琉璃河水泥厂职工再接再励
    六月份生产超额百分之三十
    七月红旗竞赛已热烈展开
    【本报讯】国营琉璃河水泥厂继红五月创出建厂以来最高纪录后，全体职工，再接再励，六月份又超额完成了生产计划，创造了突破红五月产量的最高纪录，并在节约原料减低成本上做出了相当成绩。该厂六月份生产水泥一万二千八百三十吨，超过原计划百分之三十一点九八，超过红五月产量百分之二十三点二（红五月生产水泥一○、四一四·六吨）；熟料产量至六月二十四日止为八千一百四十吨，超过原计划百分之七（原计划规定六月份生产熟料二十四天，自二十五日至三十日为检修日。红五月全月生产熟料九、九六八吨）。现该厂为巩固已有成绩，继续创造新纪录，乃于本月一日起展开了七月红旗生产竞赛，以实际的生产行动，庆祝“七一”党的生日。
    六月生产中，该厂全体职工，在“团结一致面向生产”的口号下，各人都发挥了高度的劳动热忱，英雄事迹不断出现。如六月九日，四号大旋窑内烧结了二百多公斤的大灰块不能出窑，如不进窑打出，生产即受影响。该窑看火班工人，为抓紧每时每分钟的生产，把规定准予入窑工作时间由二十四小时压缩为十二小时，在停窑后约四十分钟，看火班赵进才即带领全班工友六人，背着用水浸透了的湿麻袋，冒高热循环入窑工作，每人最长坚持到在窑内工作三分钟。当时窑内热度为一千二百度以上。工人杨锡秋在窑内被打落的碎灰块烙伤了手脚，仍坚持完成了任务。如此艰苦努力工作下，共只花去一小时，四号窑又重新点火开窑，进入正常生产。磨房看磨工人，如发现某一班生产效率稍有低落，即时召集临时会议，研究原因，立刻改正。修理股车工组，在接到六月份修配计划后，工长李文仲即召集全体车工研究了分工、合作的方法，并向该股钳工、铆工、木工、翻砂、起重各组挑战，共同提早完成了任务。车工、钳工、铆工较原计划节省了一百七十一个工。
    在节约原料、减低成本方面，该厂过去用油浪费，节油亦为六月份生产计划重点之一。磨房股李谦香（党员）把自己节油的经验介绍出来，大家向他学习，工作时随时注意，不但机器得到很好的保全，且节省了台油及机油二百多公斤。窑房工长杨锡银，在连续的生产竞赛运动中，协同浇油工友，在日夜运转不停的窑台油轴边，收集废油达十四桶，每桶一百九十公斤，用火重煎后，可以用在慢轴及速度小的牙轮及皮带轮上，节省小米达五万三千二百斤。磨房用同样方法也收集了六桶废油。粘土室工友赵福顺等，利用工余时间，将敌伪时填在地沟中的炭灰，选筛出能燃的焦炭一百余筐。（任佐）
