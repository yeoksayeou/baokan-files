Cotton Transportation Loss Incident
Shangqiu Trust Company's Reply

To the Editor:

The criticism by workers at the Hankou Xunlimen Railway Station regarding the cotton transportation loss incurred by Shangqiu Trust Company, as published in the People's Voice column on June 28th, deserves our review. However, to clarify the responsibility for the cotton loss, we offer the following points:

This batch of cotton belonged to the Taikang County Government. According to the comrade in charge of cotton delivery from the county, this batch of cotton had been in storage for over eight months. However, the custodians simply piled millions of catties of cotton into a large stack, covered with mats. The cotton was soaked during rain, causing the ropes binding the cotton to become moldy and rotten. Moreover, after repeated handling, stacking, and moving, coupled with very unreasonable packaging techniques, the cotton bales were already in tatters before shipment.

Before consignment, we repeatedly suggested to the county to hire more workers to sew up the tattered cotton bales. However, they were unwilling to accept our advice. After the Henan Daily reported this matter, we again raised the issue with them, saying, "The newspaper has criticized us!" But the Taikang County comrade in charge of cotton delivery said, "Let them criticize, it has nothing to do with you!"

The receiving organization for the cotton was the Shangqiu China Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company. All receiving and storage matters were handled by this company.

Our trust company's responsibility is transportation (i.e., transporting the cotton to the destination station, handling vehicle arrangements, and preventing theft en route). Upon arrival in Hankou, we were responsible for delivering the goods. All responsibility after delivery then rested with the Hankou Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company. This is evidenced by the contract. We hope this matter's details will be published in the newspaper to clarify the responsibilities.

Shangqiu Trust Company, June 30th

Editor's Note: From the situation reflected in the above letter, the personnel responsible for cotton delivery from the Taikang County Government bear a significant responsibility for this cotton loss. Especially their disregard for the criticism already raised in the newspaper, actually saying "Let them criticize," is a manifestation of their lack of responsibility towards the people's cause. We hope the Taikang County People's Government will urge them to conduct a thorough self-criticism. However, the Shangqiu Trust Company also has a responsibility and should not simply pass the buck. Having discovered that the cotton packaging was tattered, the company should have refused to accept the shipment. Having accepted the shipment, they should have been highly responsible for state property, handling the transportation responsibly; taking a laissez-faire attitude was also wrong.

### 运棉花造成损失事件  商邱信托公司来信答复

　　运棉花造成损失事件
    商邱信托公司来信答复编辑同志：
    六月二十八日人民园地所载汉口循礼门车站工友批评商邱信托公司运送棉花遭受损失事，是值得我们检讨的。但为了分清使棉花遭受损失的责任起见，我们提出下列几点意见。
    这批棉花是太康县政府的。据该县负责交棉花的同志谈：这批棉花业经收管八个多月。但保管人员仅将数百万斤棉花堆成一大垛，用席子盖上，下雨时棉花都淋湿了，捆棉的绳子因此发霉腐烂。又经过三番五次的搬运、堆垛、移动，加之打包技术很不合理，棉花包在起运前已破烂不堪。
    在托运前我们曾经再三向该县建议，多雇些工人将破烂的棉花包缝一缝。可是他们不愿意接受我们的意见。河南日报登载这件事后，我们又向他们提出意见说：“报纸上批评我们了！”但太康县负责交花的同志说：“让他们批评吧，与你们没有关系！”
    接收棉花的机关是商邱中国花纱布公司。一切接收和保管的事宜，都是由该公司负责办理。
    我们信托公司的责任是运输（即将棉花运到到达站，由我们交涉车辆，及途中防止偷盗）。到汉口后，由我们交货。交货后所有的责任，则由汉口花纱布公司担负。这有合同为证。望将此事经过，在报上发表，以明责任。
                             商邱信托公司  六月三十日
    编者按：从上面这封信所反映的情况看来，太康县政府交花的人员对此次棉花的损失要负很大的责任。特别是他对于报纸上已经提出了的批评，毫不注意，竟然说“让他们批评吧”，这就是他对人民事业毫无责任心的表现。望太康县人民政府督促他切实进行检讨。但商邱信托公司也有责任，不应一推了事。该公司既已发现这批棉花包装破烂不堪，就应拒绝接运；而在接运之后，就应以对国家财产高度负责的精神，负责转运，采取听之任之的态度也是错误的。
