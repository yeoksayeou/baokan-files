　　Answering Questions from a Group of Police Officers Regarding the Conversion of Wages to Rice Prices

　　To the Editor:

　　We are police officers from Beijing. In previous months, our wage rice price was issued at a 3-7 split (30% wages, 70% rice price), but this month it suddenly changed to a 5-5 split (50% wages, 50% rice price). However, the wage rice price published in the Workers' Daily is still based on the 3-7 split. We don't know the reason for this. Please provide an answer.

　　Also, in the past few months, the bureau has issued us a bag of flour each month, and the price deducted is even higher than the market price. If we sell it ourselves, we would lose 10,000 yuan. We hope the bureau will not force us to buy it.

　　A Group of Police Officers from the Fifth Outer Precinct

　　Comrades of the Fifth Outer Precinct:

　　The Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau has the following response to your opinions on the conversion of salaries to rice prices and the allocation of physical goods:

　　(1) The change in the Beijing-Tianjin rice price conversion method this time is implemented in accordance with the regulations of the Central Ministry of Finance. All administrative organs, public institutions, and enterprises whose expenditures are covered by the government have changed to calculating rice prices at a 5-5 split from May onwards. The wages of factory workers are still converted according to the 7-3 split of rice prices. The wage rice price published in the Workers' Daily is calculated at a 3-7 split because the readers of the Workers' Daily are mostly workers.

　　(2) The allocation of physical goods during salary distribution is determined based on the government's financial resources and existing physical goods. This can allow currency to return to circulation and play a certain role in stabilizing prices. In the future, if the financial situation improves, we are willing to reduce or eliminate the allocation of physical goods as much as possible. The "Locomotive" brand flour issued in May was transported from Shijiazhuang and made from North China wheat, with good quality. Because the Beijing Grain Company does not sell this brand, it is calculated according to the wholesale price of "Three Deer" brand flour. Some people have suggested that the valuation is too high. After investigation, the price of each bag of flour has been reduced by 2,000 yuan to be distributed at the same price as the "August 1st" flour of 67,000 yuan that day.

### 关于工资米价折算问题答一群警士问

　　关于工资米价折算问题答一群警士问编辑同志：
    我们是北京市的警察。前几月我们的工资米价是按三七成合价发给，而这个月突然按五五成发给，而工人日报刊登的工资米价还是三七成折价。我们不知是什么理由？请编者同志给答复一下。
    又，这几个月局方每月发给我们一袋面粉，扣价比市价还高。如果我们自己变卖，就得赔一万元。我们希望局方不要强制我们购买才好。
    外五分局一群警士外五分局警士同志：
    你们对薪资米价的折算及对配发实物的意见，由北京市人民政府财政局答复如下：
    （一）这次京津米价折算办法的变更，是依照中央财政部规定执行的。一切由政府开支的行政机关、事业机关、企业单位，自五月份起均改按五五成米价计算。各工厂职工的工资仍照七、三成米价折算。工人日报刊登的工资米价是三、七成计算的。因为工人日报的读者多系工人。
    （二）发薪时配发实物，是根据政府财力和现存实物而定的。这样可使货币回笼，在稳定物价上能起一定作用。今后财政情况好转，我们愿尽量少配发或不配发实物。五月份所发火车头牌面粉是从石家庄运来的，系用华北小麦制成，质量较好。因京市粮食公司没有出售这种牌号，乃按照三鹿粉批发价格折算。有人提出作价较高，经调查后已将每袋面粉减低二千元，与当日八一粉六万七千元同价配发。
