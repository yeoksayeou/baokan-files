Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government convened a National Match Industry Conference from June 5th to 8th, conducting a detailed analysis and discussion of the current situation of the match industry. The conference believes that in recent years, due to blind development and increased production, the production capacity and output of the match industry in various regions have exceeded demand, resulting in a surplus of match production. To change this situation, it is necessary to organize the national match industry for planned production, and formulate production plans based on actual needs, in order to avoid waste and gradually put the match industry on the track of normal development.

The conference adopted methods such as calculating match consumption based on the population of various regions, and carefully formulated a production plan for the second half of this year, determining the national monthly match output to be 48,780 boxes, which will be implemented starting in July. The distribution quota for major administrative regions across the country is: Northeast 5,840 boxes, North China 9,000 boxes, East China 20,240 boxes, Central South 8,000 boxes, Northwest 1,300 boxes, and Southwest 4,400 boxes. If the actual needs of various regions change in the future, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government may make adjustments after deliberation, in order to truly achieve a balance between production and sales.

In order to implement this production plan, the conference decided that local industrial authorities should, under the leadership of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, be responsible for allocating production tasks, supervising implementation, and reviewing prices. When allocating production tasks, they should proceed in accordance with the actual situation in various regions, and handle them through consultation under the principles of giving consideration to both public and private interests, supporting progress, taking care of the overall situation, and taking care of history. Public and private factories in various regions can, based on the principle of democratic voluntarism, organize joint ventures covering large administrative regions or major cities under the guidance of the local government, in order to coordinate production, sales, and raw material supply. At the same time, the conference also decided that, in addition to the existing match factories in various regions, which should stop expanding equipment, the establishment of new factories must be restricted in order to maintain a balance between production and sales.

In order to improve the quality of matches, the conference stipulated that only safety matches and phosphorus sesquisulfide matches should be manufactured in the future; and adopted a resolution on the specifications and standards of the above two types of matches. Yellow phosphorus matches, which were manufactured in a few areas in the past, were extremely harmful to the health and safety of manufacturing workers and consumers, and should be completely stopped in the future. In order to urge public and private match factories in various regions to effectively improve operations, reduce costs, and improve quality, the conference also adopted a resolution on the consumption standards of raw materials for safety matches and phosphorus sesquisulfide matches. Local industrial authorities can review match prices on a regular basis based on this material consumption standard to prevent speculation and manipulation. In addition, the conference believes that the issue of uniformly adopting the metric system for match specifications and standards involves manufacturing equipment and packaging materials, and match factories in various regions can gradually improve according to the actual situation in order to strive for unified implementation starting in 1951.

Regarding the production and supply of match raw materials, the conference initially studied the production of match raw materials nationwide and believed that various major raw materials have the conditions to be manufactured domestically and gradually achieve self-sufficiency. In the future, public and private match factories in various regions should give priority to using domestic raw materials. Match raw material manufacturing factories in various regions should take the necessary steps to improve equipment, increase output, and improve quality to meet the needs of the national match industry. To this end, the conference adopted two resolutions on unifying the names of match raw materials and the specifications of match raw materials as goals for improvement.

This conference was convened under the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests and adjusting production and sales. It is the beginning of the match industry moving from a state of blind production and blind competition to planned production and sales. However, in order to implement the production plan decided by the conference, in addition to the need for local industrial authorities to strengthen organizational leadership and statistical supervision, it also requires public and private match operators in various regions to consciously abide by all the resolutions of the conference.

　　全国火柴工业会议决定克服盲目生产
    统筹产销业务拟定生产计划
    通过火柴规格标准等决议，促使改善经营。
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府轻工业部在六月五日至八日召开了全国火柴工业会议，对于火柴工业的现状，进行了详尽的分析和研讨。会议认为，近年来由于盲目地发展与增产，各地火柴工业的生产能力和产量都已超过需要，而造成了火柴生产过剩的现象。为改变这种情况，必须组织全国火柴工业进行有计划的生产，根据实际的需要来拟订生产计划，才能避免浪费而使火柴工业逐渐走上正常发展的轨道。
    会议采取火柴消耗量按照各地人口推算等方法，慎重地拟订了今年下半年的生产计划，确定全国火柴月产量为四万八千七百八十箱，自七月份起开始执行。其中全国各大行政区的分配额，计东北为五千八百四十箱，华北为九千箱，华东为二万零二百四十箱，中南为八千箱，西北为一千三百箱，西南为四千四百箱。将来各地实际需要情况如有变动时，可由中央人民政府轻工业部斟酌调整，以期确实达到产销平衡。
    为了贯彻执行这一生产计划，会议决定：各地工业主管机关需在中央人民政府轻工业部领导下，负责分配生产任务、监督执行及审核价格。在分配生产任务时，应按照各地的实际情况，并在公私兼顾、扶助进步、照顾全面、照顾历史等原则下，协商处理。各地公私营工厂，则可根据民主自愿的原则，在当地政府指导之下组织以大行政区或主要都市为范围的联营组织，以统筹生产、推销和原料供应等业务。同时，会议又决定：除各地现有火柴工厂应停止扩充设备外，新厂的设立必须限制，以便保持产销平衡。
    为提高火柴品质，会议规定今后只造安全火柴和硫化磷火柴两种；并通过了关于上述两种火柴规格标准的决议。过去少数地区制造的黄磷火柴，对于制造工人和消费者的卫生安全，危害甚大，今后应一律停止制造。会议为促使各地公私营火柴工厂切实改善经营、降低成本、提高品质，又通过了安全火柴与硫化磷火柴用料消耗标准的决议。各地工业主管机关可以根据此项用料消耗标准，按期审核火柴价格，防止投机操纵的现象发生。此外，会议认为，火柴规格标准统一采用度量衡公制问题，因牵涉到制造设备及包装材料等方面，各地火柴工厂可按照实际情形，逐步改进，以便争取于一九五一年起统一实施。
    关于火柴原料的生产与供应问题，会议初步研究了全国火柴原料的生产情况，认为各种主要原料在国内已有自行制造、逐步达到自给的条件。今后各地公私营火柴工厂，应尽先采用国产原料。各地火柴原料制造工厂，则应采取必要的步骤，改良设备，增加产量，提高品质，供应全国火柴工业的需要。会议为此通过了关于统一火柴原料名称和火柴原料规格的两个决议，作为努力改进的目标。
    这次会议是在公私兼顾、调整产销的方针之下召开的，是火柴工业从盲目生产、盲目竞争的状态走向计划产销的一个开端。但要贯彻执行会议所决定的生产计划，除了各地工业主管机关必须加强组织领导与统计监督外，还需要各地公私营火柴业者自觉地起来遵行会议的一切决议。
