　　Deeply Develop the Manure Accumulation Movement
　　Editor's note: This article, originally titled "Developing the Manure Accumulation Movement to Improve Soil Fertility," was published in the Northeast Daily on the 17th of this month. It provided many specific suggestions on how to carry out the manure accumulation movement in the Northeast this year during the post-hoeing period. We have now slightly abridged it, added subheadings, and reprinted it below for the reference of comrades in various regions who lead agricultural production.
　　An Important Link in Increasing Production
　　The Northeast Bureau and the Northeast People's Government have always instructed us that the development of agricultural production should mainly adopt the principle of intensive and meticulous cultivation, supplemented by expanding the cultivated area. That is to say, the focus of developing agricultural production should basically be on increasing unit yield. Since the land reform, we have done a lot of work in this regard, achieving year-by-year increases in production. In order to further increase agricultural production, we must make even greater efforts. One of the important links in increasing unit yield is to improve soil fertility. Under existing technical conditions, conscientiously doing a good job in manure accumulation and fertilization is the most practical and effective method to improve soil fertility and increase agricultural productivity.
　　In recent years, although manure accumulation and fertilization in various regions have increased year by year, the basic methods of manure accumulation have not been improved. Both the quantity and quality of manure have failed to improve further. Many fertilizers that could be utilized have not been widely used (such as green manure and human waste); the general manure yards of the masses are often placed in sunny open spaces outside the door, exposed to wind and sun, and washed away by rain. Most of the main chemical nutrients are dissipated, and some organic matter cannot fully exert its fertilizer effect due to a lack of good fermentation and decay. In terms of fertilization, the method of spreading manure is often used, while the method of filtering manure is rarely used, resulting in another dissipation of the nutrient content of the manure.
　　The Guiding Role of Manure Accumulation Plans in Recent Years Has Not Been Significant
　　If you look through the sections on manure accumulation in the agricultural production plans of various regions over the years, you will find similar formulas as follows: This year, the entire region is required to fertilize a certain percentage of the area, and each hectare of land is required to apply a certain number of carts (or jin) of manure. Different regions require different percentages of fertilized area, and it is generally required to improve the quality of manure and promote key topdressing. This is the general outline of fertilization plans.
　　What is the basis for this plan? It is generally based on the fertilization situation in the region in the previous year, and the estimation of the manure accumulation situation of the masses in the current year. The plans are mostly formulated in the winter of the previous year, and announced and implemented mostly in the spring of the current year. Counties and districts above have general production plans, while villages and settlements have fewer specific production plans. Based on the above situation, after reviewing, the following conclusions can be roughly drawn:
　　First, the plan itself is blind and does not conform to reality. This can be proved by the reports of various regions summarizing fertilization work, often exceeding or falling below the percentage required by the plan.
　　Second, the guiding role of the plan itself is not significant. Because manure must have a fermentation process, the plan announced in the current spring, even if the masses immediately take action to collect manure, it is often too late to carry out fermentation. To be applied to the ground in the current year, at most, some key parts can be used for topdressing.
　　Third, since villages and settlements have few specific manure accumulation plans, it is clear that they cannot effectively guide the specific actions of the masses. It can be seen that the manure accumulation and fertilization of the masses in recent years, although it has increased year by year, is basically spontaneous (because the masses fully understand that more manure means more grain). It is undeniable that leadership in this regard often stops at general appeals and lacks specific guidance and in-depth organizational work. Some regions are satisfied with the expansion of the percentage of fertilized area, but in actual inspection, there is more soil and less manure, and the quality is extremely poor. The masses focus on quantity rather than quality in manure accumulation, and are greedy for the percentage of fertilized area. This reflects formalism and coercive commandism in leadership.
　　Should Specifically Organize the Masses to Accumulate Manure
　　Rural work comrades should first learn general technical knowledge of manure accumulation, and then, through persuasion and education, overcome some conservative habits of the masses and carry out a series of specific organizational work, such as digging manure pits, building toilets, building livestock sheds, pressing green manure, and raising livestock and poultry. These are all things that the masses can do but have not done well. This major issue related to manure accumulation should never be regarded as a trivial matter. It should be pointed out that, until today, we have not found many typical areas that have truly done this set of organizational work effectively. Furthermore, taking the issue of urban manure going to the countryside as an example, various regions have called for it for several years. How many cities and towns have actually carried out this organizational work? According to our understanding, many cities and towns have not yet started this organizational work. Several large cities have organized large manure yards, and the masses in the suburbs would rather not travel, not earn money, but compete to spend money to buy manure and haul it home. This shows how urgently the masses need manure. However, many of our cities with tens of thousands of people have not seriously organized large manure yards to solve the urgent needs of the rural masses. Some comrades in certain regions place the hope of expanding fertilization on chemical fertilizers in industrial development, which is not entirely correct. With the development of industry, the supply of chemical fertilizers can gradually increase, and we will gradually apply them in large quantities. However, chemical fertilizers also have their side effects and are not as able to maintain soil fertility as farm manure and compost. Even in socialist countries, farm manure and compost are still highly valued today.
　　Clearly Define the Manure Accumulation Year
　　Deeply Develop the Manure Accumulation Movement
　　In order to effectively improve soil fertility and increase agricultural productivity, we must overcome the old ways of working and create a new historical record in manure accumulation.
　　First, a manure accumulation year should be clearly defined, which is different from the general agricultural production plan year. The general manure accumulation year should roughly extend from the spring plowing and sowing of the previous year to the spring plowing and sowing of the current year. Only by doing a good job in the manure accumulation work of the previous year can we lay a sufficient material foundation for the production increase plan of the next year.
　　Second, the post-hoeing period is the central season of the manure accumulation year, and a mass manure accumulation movement should be widely and deeply carried out. Currently, various regions should immediately summarize the manure accumulation situation of the masses since the spring plowing and sowing, and formulate an annual manure accumulation plan until the spring plowing and sowing of next year, as a goal to strive for. Specific requirements for the mass manure accumulation movement during the post-hoeing period:
　　(1) Universally build toilets in rural areas and establish large manure yards in urban areas. It is estimated that if the human waste of the entire Northeast is universally utilized, it can reach millions of tons per year, which can be mixed with other compost and applied to millions of hectares of land.
　　(2) Repair livestock sheds, pull soil to pad the pens, dig out the stove beds to make compost, cut grass to press green manure, and improve compost yards to avoid wind, sun, and rain washing away. This invisible loss must be deeply noted.
　　Third, in the manure accumulation movement, in addition to general appeals, various regions must provide in-depth and specific guidance. This requires doing a good job in several typical villages and settlements, and also requires agricultural departments to send cadres to conduct specific technical guidance.
　　Local demonstration farms and agricultural experiment stations should set a good example in nearby villages and settlements for demonstration purposes. Farmers in the Northeast do not have the habit of pressing green manure in terms of manure accumulation, and do not have the habit of using human waste. It is necessary to promote it through persuasion, education, and specific guidance.
　　Fourth, according to our understanding, the quantity and quality of manure accumulated by the masses in many regions have decreased in recent years, mainly due to the reduction of draft animals and livestock compared to the past. Therefore, conscientiously protecting and breeding draft animals, and organizing the masses to raise more pigs and chickens in a planned way, are things that we should always pay attention to.

### 深入开展积肥运动

专栏：

　　深入开展积肥运动
    编者按：本文原题名《开展积肥运动增进地力》，登载在本月十七日的东北日报上，对东北今年挂锄期间应如何开展积肥运动，提供了许多具体意见。现在把它略加删节，另加小标题，转载在下面，供各地领导农业生产的同志作参考。
    增加产量的重要环节
    东北局和东北人民政府历来指示我们发展农业生产应采取精耕细作为主、扩大耕地面积为辅的方针。这就是说，发展农业生产的重点基本应放在增加单位产量方面。土地改革以来，我们在这方面作了许多工作，达到产量的逐年增加。为了更多增加农业产量，我们必须有更进一步的努力。增加单位产量的重要环节之一，在于增进地力。在现有技术条件下，认真的做好积肥施肥工作，是增进地力提高农业生产力最实际的有效方法。
    近年各地积肥施肥，虽则逐年有所增加，但是由于积肥方法基本未曾改进，无论粪肥数量与质量，均未能更加提高一步。很多可以被利用的肥料未被广泛利用（如绿肥与人粪尿等）；群众一般粪场往往放在门外的向阳平地，任其风吹日晒，雨水冲洗，其中最主要的化学养分多有消散，某些有机质则因缺乏很好发酵腐熟，而不能充分发挥其肥效。在施肥上，又多用扬粪法，少用滤粪法，粪肥养分又遭到一次消散。
    历年积肥计划指导作用不大
    试翻阅各地历年的农业生产计划关于积肥的部分，就会发现大同小异的公式如下：今年全区要求施肥面积达到百分之若干，每垧地要求上粪若干车（或斤），不同地区要求不同的施肥面积百分数，普遍要求提高粪肥质量，提倡有重点进行追肥。这就是一般有关施肥计划的轮廓。
    这种计划的根据是什么呢？大体是根据本地区头年施肥情况，及对当年群众积肥情况的估计确定的。计划的制定多在头年冬季，公布实行则多在当年春季。县区以上都有一般的生产计划，村屯则较少具体的生产计划。根据上述情况检讨一下，大体可得如下结论：
    第一、计划本身即带盲目性，不切合实际。这由各地总结施肥工作，时常超过或低于计划要求的百分数报告，即可证明。
    第二、计划本身指导作用不大。因粪肥须有发酵过程，当年春季公布的计划，即使群众立刻行动起来，拾粪积肥，往往是来不及实行发酵的，要求当年上到地里，至多可有部分重点用在追肥上。
    第三、村屯既少具体积肥计划，显然不能切实指导群众的具体行动。由此可见，近年群众的积肥施肥，尽管逐年有所增加，基本还是带有自发性质的（因为群众完全获得多上粪多打粮）。不可否认的，在这方面领导往往停止在一般号召上，而缺乏具体的指导，缺乏深入的组织工作。某些地区满足于施肥面积百分数的扩大，实际检查起来，则土多粪少，质量极坏。群众积肥重量不重质，贪图施肥面积百分数，这反映着领导上的形式主义与强迫命令作风。
    应具体组织群众积肥
    农村工作同志应该首先自己学会一般积肥的技术常识，然后经过说服教育，克服群众的某些保守习惯，进行一系列的具体组织工作，譬如挖粪坑，修厕所，盖畜舍，压绿肥，饲养家畜家禽。这都是群众可能做到而尚未做到好处的。这种有关积肥的大问题，绝不应看成细小的琐事。应该指出，直到今天，我们还未发现有多少典型地区，真正把这一套组织工作切实做到好处。再以城粪下乡问题来说，各地号召几年了，究竟有多少城镇切实进行这一组织工作了呢？据我们了解很多城镇至今未曾着手进行这一组织工作。几个大城市组织了大粪场，郊区群众车马往往宁肯不拉脚，不赚钱，也要争着花钱买大粪拉回家去。这就说明群众如何迫切需要大粪。而我们许多几万人口的城市，却一直未能认真组织大粪场，解决农村群众的迫切需要。某些地区有的同志把扩大施肥的希望寄托在工业发展中的化学肥料方面，这是不完全正确的。随着工业发展，化学肥料的供给，可以日益增多，我们是要逐渐大量应用的。但化学肥料还有其副作用，并不如厩肥堆肥之能够保持地力。就是在社会主义国家，今天也还是十分重视厩肥堆肥的。
    明确规定积肥年度
    深入开展积肥运动
    为了切实作到增进地力，提高农业生产力，就必须克服工作中老一套的作风，在积肥工作中创造一个历史的新纪录。
    一、应该明确规定一个积肥年度，这是和一般农业生产计划年度有区别的。一般积肥年度应该大体从头年春耕播种时起到当年春耕播种时止。只有上年度积肥工作作到好处，才能给下年度增产计划打下充分的物质基础。
    二、挂锄期间是积肥年度的中心季节，应该普遍深入开展群众的积肥运动。目前各地应即总结春耕播种以来群众积肥的情况，制定到明年春耕播种时为止的年度积肥计划，以为奋斗的目标。挂锄期间群众积肥运动的具体要求：
    （１）农村普遍修建厕所，城镇普遍建立大粪场，据估计全东北人粪尿如果普遍利用起来，每年可达数百万吨，掺合其他堆肥混用，可上地数百万垧。
    （２）修理畜舍，拉土垫圈，扒炕堆肥，割草压绿肥，并改善堆肥场，避免风吹日晒及雨水冲洗流散。这种无形损失，必须引起深切注意。
    三、在积肥运动中，除了一般号召之外，各地必须深入具体指导，这就要求搞好若干村屯的典型，同时也要求农业部门派干部进行具体的技术指导。
    各地示范农场农事试验场应该在附近村屯做好样子，以资示范。东北农民在积肥方面，没有压绿肥的习惯，没有利用人粪尿的习惯，就需要经过说服教育，加以具体指导，才能推动起来。
    四、据我们了解，近年许多地区群众积肥数量质量降低了，主要是由于耕畜与家畜较前减少，因此认真保护与繁殖耕畜，有计划地组织群众多养猪多养鸡，是我们应该经常重视的工作。
