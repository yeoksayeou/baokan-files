The Xinghai Chorus, jointly organized by the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Association of Music Education, and the Beijing People's Art Theatre, has been actively preparing and has decided to formally establish itself and commence activities on the 17th of this month.

The Xinghai Chorus primarily targets workers and students. Under the leadership of the Federation of Trade Unions, workers have extensively organized themselves, participating in singing activities, writing lyrics reflecting the actual lives of workers, and cultivating their own cultural and recreational cadres. Under the leadership of the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee and the promotion of school music teachers, students have actively registered and organized themselves. Currently, the total number of registered core members of the chorus is nearly 500. Ordinary members of district and school branches are currently registering, and it is estimated that several thousand people will participate. Work will commence actively at the beginning of the summer vacation.

As July 17th marks the 15th anniversary of Nie Er's death, in addition to holding a memorial ceremony, the chorus plans to perform posthumous works by Xinghai and Nie Er. The program will primarily consist of singing, with instrumental music as a supplement. Works already selected for performance include Xinghai's "Production Grand Song and Dance" (adapted from "Production Cantata"), Nie Er's "Yangtze River Storm" (song and dance), "The Road," "Pioneers," "New Woman," and "Tea Picking." The program is currently being actively planned and rehearsed. (Beijing People's Art Theatre Communications Group)
