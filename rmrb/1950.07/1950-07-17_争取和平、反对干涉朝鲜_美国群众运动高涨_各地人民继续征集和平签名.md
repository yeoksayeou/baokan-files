The Kim City Committee of the Communist Party of the United States organized a rally at Webster Hall in New York. Hall, the secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, delivered a speech stating: The movement to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs should be combined with a broad movement to demand the cessation of intervention in Korea and other countries in the Pacific.

The masses attending the meeting condemned the American aggression against Korea and expressed their support for the Stockholm Appeal. Steros, vice chairman of the Fur Workers Union, addressed the meeting and stated: The Korean people must be allowed to decide their own affairs within their country.

The newspaper also stated: The common people, especially the working class, are paying the price for American aggression, but for corporations, the Korean War is a new source of excess profits.

    【新华社十六日讯】综合塔斯社消息：争取和平、反对美国干涉朝鲜的运动正在美国高涨中。美国共产党金氏城市委会在纽约韦伯斯特大厅组织集会，美共全国委员会书记霍尔发表演说称：要求禁用原子弹的运动，应该与要求停止干涉朝鲜和太平洋其他国家的广泛运动结合起来。会上宣布：在布鲁克林，已为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了十七万个签名。
    由和平运动新闻站主催，纽约曾于十二日举行群众大会。与会群众谴责美国侵略朝鲜的行为，并表示拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言，毛皮工人工会副主席史特罗斯向大会讲话称：必须让朝鲜人民自行决定他们在国内的事情。进步分子必须组织拥护和平的美国人民，去阻挡奔向第三次世界大战的反动的活动。罗伯逊的妻子在会上发表演说称：亿万美国母亲要为她们的儿女争取和平。
    和平运动新闻站主席黑人历史学家杜波依斯通电谴责美国侵略朝鲜的行为。他说：外国干涉朝鲜的一切行为必须立即加以制止。
    拥有一万五千会员的华盛顿养老金协会的州委员会一致通过决议，要求停止干涉朝鲜。该委员会决定在最近的将来在华盛顿州为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集五万个签名。
    工人日报的社论指出：作为武力干涉和战争歇斯底里的结果，主要粮食与生活必需品价格已经上涨。该报又称：老百姓特别是工人阶级，为美国的侵略行为付出代价，但对公司来说，朝鲜战争是超额利润的一个新来源。
