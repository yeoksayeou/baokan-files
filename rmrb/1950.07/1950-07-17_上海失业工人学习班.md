　　Shanghai Unemployed Workers' Study Class
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Lin Wei
　　The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has already carried out some emergency relief for unemployed workers. Including family members, more than 60,000 people have received relief. The Unemployed Workers Relief Committee was established at the beginning of the month and is currently carrying out registration and organizational work, planning to universally implement various relief measures, mainly work-for-relief. The first batch of work-for-relief projects began in mid-June; hundreds of unemployed workers participated, actively building parks and other public places.
　　The unemployed workers in Shanghai deeply know that only through their own labor can they overcome the current difficulties with the help of their class brothers throughout the country. Therefore, they enthusiastically participated in work-for-relief construction projects and tried to organize themselves to carry out production for self-salvation. They are learning from the example of the working class in Northeast China and the Soviet Union in overcoming difficulties and moving towards a bright and happy future, using their own diligence, courage, and wisdom to save production and maintain life during the current difficult period. The most typical example is the production cooperative factory (hardware factory) created by the unemployed workers of Shanghai themselves. This factory started from scratch. The unemployed workers used some of the remuneration obtained from repairing the Qingyang Port Bridge (Shanghai-Nanjing Railway) and other railway projects as capital, and started this factory on a wasteland in September last year. At first, everything was done manually. Now that they have made money, they have bought 50 machine tools, and the capital has increased to 80,000 units. Many factory buildings have been built on the wasteland, and there are four branch factories. The number of workers has increased from the initial 300 to more than 1,000. Their achievements are not small.
　　With the development of work-for-relief, production for self-salvation, and other work, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the Federation of Trade Unions have also opened training classes for unemployed workers. Now the Shanghai Municipal Unemployed Workers Relief Committee also plans to use the school summer vacation to mobilize teachers and students to set up more training classes, so that more than 20,000 unemployed workers will have the opportunity to study in July. In late June, I visited an unemployed workers' study class. In the study class, I saw the perseverance and confident spirit of the Chinese working class, enthusiastically studying for future participation in the production and construction of New China.
　　In this study class, there are unemployed workers from knitting, silk weaving, chemical and other industries, from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and also from Shandong and other places. Their uplifting and pleasant mood, lively and cheerful conversation, makes it hard to imagine that they are a group of unemployed people. One of them, named Zhang Jinwen, clearly recorded the three sentences spoken by the representative of the East China People's Navy when he came to visit them: "Many naval comrades, hearing that you are unemployed, not only saved food and vegetable money, but also donated some of their savings in Hong Kong dollars and their beloved 21 gold rings." "Many naval comrades took the yellow tobacco money that was originally to be sent to their families in the countryside to help you." "Some naval comrades were sick or injured, but they did not care about themselves and used the health care money they received to help you." Zhang Jinwen annotated under the first paragraph: "They care about us so much: more precious than the gold they wear!" Annotated under the second paragraph: "They care about us so much: more intimate than their own blood relatives!" Annotated under the third paragraph: "They care about us so much: more important than their own lives!" Further down it says: "Always remember this great friendship, do a good job in study, do a good job in work. When you enter the factory in the future, you must do a good job in production." This is one of the main reasons why the unemployed workers in the study class are so full of confidence and do not seem to be unemployed.
　　Many workers remember that in the era of the Kuomintang reactionaries, if they lost their jobs, they could only go out and beg. Sometimes underground revolutionary organizations raised a little money and opened some big pot porridge, but the secret agents said it was "illegal activity" and smashed the pots. Today, the People's Government, under great difficulties, has allocated a large amount of food to provide relief. Hundreds of millions of donations, thousands of enthusiastic letters and telegrams of condolences, pour into Shanghai every day from national and provincial, municipal organs, troops, schools, groups, factories and shops. In addition to donating money, the employed workers in this city donated items covering all aspects of life needs: rice, flour, white sugar, clothes, cloth, shoes and socks, soap, cigarettes, toothpaste, toothbrushes, pens, batteries, and even cold food and mosquito coils, everything is available. Some voluntarily carry out voluntary labor to help their class brothers, increase night shifts, or donate all the bonuses they get. This surging wave has even involved individual capitalists. Throughout the history of China, who can find such a large-scale donation campaign launched to help unemployed workers?
　　The reading of letters and telegrams of condolences, and the announcements of donated money and goods, inject new emotions and new strength into the blood of unemployed workers every day. It makes them see the light and feel the warmth. They all write back to their employed workmates with the same enthusiastic words, telling them to "work hard to produce and build a new China." Write back to the People's Liberation Army, wishing them "an early liberation of Tibet and Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate the whole of China!" Expressing that they will never be pessimistic and disappointed, and will never let down the enthusiasm of their brothers for help. They use wall newspapers to express their willingness to do a good job in work and study, and review their previous wrong views on the causes of unemployment and the future. Unemployed workers with a little savings are willing not to receive emergency relief rice, so that brothers who have run out of food and are about to run out of food can receive a little more. Some even donate part of their own savings to save others. They believe that when they encounter difficulties, they will also receive support.
　　In order to better meet the requirements of building a new China, they consciously and diligently study. For individual workmates who were not diligent when they first came, everyone automatically urged them to improve. A workmate named Wu Xinan posted a bill on the wall newspaper, calculating the cost of rice, oil, firewood, and vegetables needed for more than 700 people to study for 21 days, totaling more than 30 million yuan. Finally, he wrote: "Comrades! We have spent such a large number of relief funds, why? What do we rely on? Let's all think quietly! Think!" This kind of cordial and serious urging made the non-diligent workmates quickly catch up. Some even became learning models in the later stage.

### 上海失业工人学习班

　　上海失业工人学习班
    本报特派记者  林韦
    上海市人民政府对失业工人已经进行过一些紧急救济。得到救济的，连家属在内已经有六万多人。失业工人救济委员会月初成立后，正在进行登记、组织工作，计划普遍展开以工代赈为主的各项救济。第一批以工代赈的工程，已在六月中旬开始；数百失业工人参加，积极地修筑着公园等公共场所。
    上海市的失业工人，深切地知道，只有用自己的劳动，才能在全国阶级弟兄的协助下，度过目前的困难。因而他们踊跃地参加了以工代赈的工程建设，并设法组织起来，进行生产自救。他们学习着东北和苏联的工人阶级克服困难、走向光明幸福的榜样，用自己的勤劳、勇敢和智慧，节约生产，维持目前困难时期的生活。最典型的事例是，上海失业工人自己所创建的生产合作工厂（五金厂）。这个工厂是白手起家的。失业工人用修复青阳港大桥（沪宁路）等铁路工程中所得的一些报酬作本钱，于去年九月在一片荒地上开办起这个工厂，起初什么都是用人力干，现在赚了钱已经买下了五十架工作母机，资金也已增至八万个单位。荒地上已经盖起了许多厂房，并有了四个分厂。工人从最初的三百人增至一千多人。他们的成绩是不小的。
    随着以工代赈、生产自救等工作的开展，上海市人民政府和总工会，又开办了失业工人的训练班。现在上海市失业工人救济委员会还计划利用学校暑假期间，动员教员、学生增办训练班，使两万以上的失业工人在七月份内得到学习的机会。我在上月下旬，去参观了一个失业工人学习班。在学习班里，我看见了中国工人阶级的坚忍和充满信心的精神，热情地在为将来参加新中国的生产建设学习着。
    在这个学习班里，有针织、丝织、化工等行业的失业工人，有江苏人、浙江人，也有山东等地的人。他们那振奋愉快的情调，活泼爽朗的言谈，使人很难想像到他们是失了业的一群。他们中的一个，名叫张锦文，清晰地记下了华东人民海军的代表，到这里来慰问他们时讲的三段话：“有许多海军同志听说你们失业，不但节省了粮食、菜金，并且把他们积蓄的一些港币和心爱的二十一只金戒指也捐了出来。”“有许多海军同志，把本来要寄到乡下给家属度荒的黄烟费拿来帮助你们。”“有些海军同志生了病，负了伤，但他们毫不顾虑自己，把领来的保健费救济你们。”张锦文在第一段下自注：“这样关心我们：比自己佩戴的黄金还宝贵！”第二段下自注：“这样关心我们：比自己血统的家属还亲切！”第三段下自注：“这样关心我们：比自己的生命还重要！”再后面写着：“永远记住这伟大的友爱，搞好学习，搞好工作。将来进了工厂，要搞好生产。”这就是学习班里失业工人们所以充满信心，而不像是失了业的主要原因之一。
    许多工人记得：在国民党反动派统治时代，失了业只有自己出去乞讨。有时地下革命组织募集一点钱，开一些大锅粥，特务们说这是“非法活动”，把锅都砸了。今天，人民政府在重重困难之下，拨出大批粮食来救济。数以亿计的捐款，千万封热情慰问的信件与电报，每天从全国与各省、市机关、部队、学校、团体与工厂、商店涌到上海。本市在业工人除捐款外，赠送的物品包括了生活所需的一切方面：食米、面粉、白糖、衣服、布匹、鞋袜、肥皂、香烟、牙膏、牙刷、钢笔、电池，以至冷食、蚊香，无所不有。有的为救助自己的阶级兄弟，自动实行义务劳动，增加夜班，或将所得奖金全部捐出。这种汹涌的浪潮，甚至把个别资本家也卷了进来。翻遍中国的历史，谁能找到这样巨大规模的为救济失业工人而发动的捐款？
    慰问函电的诵读，捐赠钱物的公报，每天以新的感情、新的力量注入失业工人的血液。使他们看到了光明，也感到了温暖。他们都以同样热情的语句复信给在业的工友，叫他们“努力生产，建设新中国。”复信给解放军，祝他们“早日解放西藏、台湾，活捉蒋该死，解放全中国！”表示自己绝不悲观失望，绝不辜负兄弟们的救助的热情。他们利用墙报表示自己搞好工作与学习的志愿，检讨不久以前对失业原因与前途的错误看法。有点积蓄的失业工人，都自愿不领急救米，让断了炊的和即将断炊的兄弟们多领一点。有的甚至反而捐出自己的部分积蓄去救别人。他们相信，在自己发生困难时，也同样会得到支援的。
    为使自己更适合建设新中国的要求，他们自觉地勤恳地学习着。对于初来时个别不努力的工友，大家自动督促他们上进。有一个名叫吴锡南的工友，在墙报上贴了一张账单子，把七百多人学习二十一天所需米、油、柴、菜的费用逐项作了个计算，总共需要三千多万元。最后写道：“同志们！我们花费了救济基金里这么大的数字，我们为什么？凭什么？我们大家静静地想！想！”这种亲切的严肃的督促，使不努力的工友都很快跟了上来。有的并在后期变成了学习模范。
