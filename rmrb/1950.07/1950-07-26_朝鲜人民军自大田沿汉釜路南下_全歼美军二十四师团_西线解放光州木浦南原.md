Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th: The Korean People's Army Headquarters announced in a war report on the morning of the 24th that People's Army units are heavily striking the fleeing U.S. ground forces and the remaining troops of the Lee Seung-man puppet army, continuing their advance southward. On the west coast, after liberating a large number of counties, townships, districts, and villages, the People's Army liberated Gwangju, the capital of South Jeolla Province, on the 23rd. In this battle, over 1,000 puppet soldiers and police were killed and over 300 were captured. A large number of spoils of war were seized.

The People's Army, advancing south from Daejeon along the Han (Seoul)-Busan railway, liberated Okcheon District and Yeongdong District in North Chungcheong Province on the 23rd. In this campaign, the People's Army completely annihilated the remaining troops of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division. Among them, over 1,500 U.S. soldiers were killed and over 100 U.S. soldiers were captured alive. The following spoils of war were seized: 479 vehicles, 27 armored vehicles, 8 60mm mortars, 4 75mm guns, 12 mountain guns, 5 howitzers, 3 heavy guns, 50 anti-aircraft machine guns, 35 light machine guns, 120 automatic rifles, 62 pistols, 9 tanks, 3 37mm guns, 65 60mm mortars, 5 155mm guns, 4 flat trajectory guns, 25 automatic cannons, 7 anti-aircraft guns, 52 heavy machine guns, 527 rifles, 203 carbines, 22 radio stations, hundreds of thousands of rounds of various gun and cannon ammunition, one military warehouse, and one military train fully loaded with military supplies.

Thus, the U.S. 24th Infantry Division has been completely annihilated or surrendered under the fierce offensive of the People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th: A frontline reporter from the Korean Central News Agency reported on the battle of Daejeon, in which the main force of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was annihilated, stating that the U.S. invading army had set up Daejeon as their new defense line, attempting to block the advance of the People's Army. They placed great hope in Daejeon, so they deployed the entire main force of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division on the Daejeon front. After the enemy's defeat in the Cheonan campaign, they concentrated all their efforts to set up the Geum River defense line, mobilizing artillery and tank units to the front line, and using a large number of air force units to cover the firepower points of the Geum River defensive positions, attempting to prevent the advance of the People's Army tank units.

However, the heroic People's Army broke through the defense network of the U.S. ground and air forces, and victoriously crossed the Geum River on the 15th, completely destroying the defense line that the U.S. military boasted about. In the battles of Daereung-ri and Daepyeong-ri on the south bank of the Geum River, northwest of Daejeon, the People's Army inflicted an unprecedented and annihilating blow on the main force of the U.S. military.

The enemy launched stubborn counter-attacks several times against the People's Army units that had broken through the first line, and the enemy in the air simultaneously carried out fierce bombing, and the enemy's tank units also attacked the People's Army. But the swift People's Army, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, and in coordination with tank units, stopped the enemy's attack and surrounded the enemy's main force in Daejeon. At this time, the enemy again attempted to break through the flanks of the People's Army to find a way out, and carried out stubborn breakout struggles, but to no avail, and was crushed by the fierce attacks of the People's Army. The main force of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was thus encircled and annihilated by the People's Army in the Battle of Daejeon.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th: The Headquarters of the People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the evening of the 24th that the People's Army, advancing southwest from Gwangju, completely liberated Mokpo City, the last major city and port on the west coast, on the 24th. On the same day, another part of the People's Army liberated Namwon County, the southernmost part of North Jeolla Province, and is now continuing to advance south. In the battle to liberate Namwon, the People's Army killed, wounded, and captured many enemies, and seized many spoils of war.

On the 23rd and 24th, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down two U.S. B-29 type bombers attacking Haeju and Pyongyang. Among the U.S. B-29 type bombers shot down over Pyongyang on the 24th, the bodies of fourteen U.S. Air Force generals and officers were found.

Among the U.S. prisoners of war captured alive by the People's Army in the battle southeast of Daejeon, one was identified as the commander of the 30th Regiment of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division.

　　朝鲜人民军自大田沿汉釜路南下
    全歼美军二十四师团
    西线解放光州木浦南原
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜人民军总部二十四日晨发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线上沉重打击着溃逃的美军地面部队与李承晚残余伪军，继续向南挺进。西海岸方面，人民军在解放了为数极多的县、邑、区与村庄后，于二十三日解放了全罗南道的省会光州市。在这一战斗中，击毙伪军警一千余名，俘虏三百余名。缴获各种战利品甚多。
    自大田沿汉（城）釜（山）铁路南下的人民军，二十三日解放了忠清北道的沃川区与永同区。人民军在这一战役中全部歼灭了美军步兵第二十四师团的残余部队。其中击毙美军一千五百余名、活捉美军一百余名。缴获战利品如下：汽车四百七十九辆、装甲车二十七辆、六零炮八门、七五炮四门、山炮十二门、榴弹炮五门、重炮三门、高射机关枪五十挺、轻机枪三十五挺、自动枪一百二十支、手枪六十二支、坦克九辆、三七炮三门、六零迫击炮六十五门、一五五公厘炮五门、平射炮四门、自动炮二十五门、高射炮七门、重机枪五十二挺、步枪五百二十七支、卡宾枪二百零三支、电台二十二部、各种枪炮弹数十万发、军用仓库一个、满载军需品的军用列车一列。
    这样，美军步兵第二十四师团在人民军的猛烈进攻下，已全部被歼或投降。
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜中央通讯社战地记者报道大田战斗歼灭美军第二十四师团主力的战况称：美国侵略军将大田布置为他们的新防线，企图阻挡人民军的进攻。他们寄托于大田的希望很大，所以将美军第二十四师团的主力全部布置在大田前线。敌人在天安战役失败后，就集中全力来布置锦江防卫线，将炮兵与坦克部队动员到第一线上，并以数量极大的空军部队掩护锦江防御阵地的火力点，企图借此阻止人民军坦克部队的前进。
    但是英勇的人民军突破了美军地面部队和空中部队的防御网，于十五日胜利渡过锦江，完全破坏了为美军自夸的防卫线。人民军在大田西北锦江南岸的大逆里、大平里的战斗中，予美军主力以空前的歼灭性的打击。
    敌人对突破第一线的人民军部队，曾数次进行顽强的反攻，空中的敌人同时进行了猛烈的炸射，地面敌人的坦克部队亦向人民军进攻。但神速的人民军，在飞机与炮兵的掩护下，和坦克部队协同作战的结果，阻止了敌人的进攻，并包围了大田敌人的主力。这时敌人又企图突破人民军侧翼寻找出路，而进行了顽强的突围挣扎，但未得逞，而被人民军的猛烈攻击所粉碎。美军第二十四师团的主力就这样在大田战役中，被人民军围歼了。
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总部二十四日晚发表战报称：自光州向西南推进的人民军，二十四日完全解放了西海岸最后一个主要城市与港口——木浦市。同日，人民军另部解放了全罗北道最南端的南原县，现正继续向南挺进中。人民军在解放南原的战斗中，毙、伤、俘敌人甚多，缴获许多战利品。
    人民军高射炮部队二十三与二十四两日，在海州与平壤击落来袭的美军Ｂ——二十九型轰炸机两架。二十四日在平壤上空击落的美Ｂ——二十九型轰炸机中，发现了美空军将校十四名的尸体。
    在大田东南战斗中被人民军活捉的美军俘虏里，发现有美军第二十四步兵师第三十团团长一名。
