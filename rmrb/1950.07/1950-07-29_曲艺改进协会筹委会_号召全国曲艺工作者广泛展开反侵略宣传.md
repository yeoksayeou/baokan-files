　　Quyi Improvement Association Preparatory Committee
    Calls on Quyi Workers Nationwide to Launch Extensive Anti-Aggression Propaganda
    [Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Quyi Improvement Association issued a call on July 18, requesting quyi improvement organizations and groups and all quyi workers in various regions across the country to participate in the signature campaign for the Declaration to Defend World Peace and the movement to oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The call stated: Our quyi workers must first strive to study the propaganda documents on defending world peace and opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, thoroughly recognize the criminal acts of American imperialism in invading the Asian people and destroying world peace, thoroughly recognize the unparalleled strength of the world's peace-loving people led by the Soviet Union, and thoroughly understand that American imperialism is not only not to be feared when it comes to engaging in aggression, but is also completely defeatable. The call also encouraged signing the Declaration to Defend World Peace, and launching propaganda in various quyi forms in various regions to defend world peace and oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea.
    The call concluded by saying: Propaganda work should be coordinated with various mass rallies or street and rural propaganda speeches, etc., to ensure that it is in-depth and widespread, and propaganda materials, slogans, etc. must be posted in all places that attract public attention. The main thing is to use our own abilities to write and perform various drum lyrics, commentary lyrics, crosstalk, etc., to sing out the significance of defending world peace and opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. At the performance venues, the signing of the Declaration to Defend World Peace can be initiated. (Attached picture)
