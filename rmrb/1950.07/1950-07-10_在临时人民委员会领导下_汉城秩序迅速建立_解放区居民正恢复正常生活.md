Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: The people of Seoul, liberated from the criminal rule of the Lee Seung-man traitorous clique, are rapidly establishing a democratic order under the leadership of the Provisional People's Committee. Financial associations and banks in the city have been operating as usual since June 30th. Telecommunications and telephone services, thanks to the organized prevention of sabotage by members of the National Council of Labor Unions (a progressive trade union organization in South Korea) before the Lee Seung-man bandit gang fled, were fully restored to external communications and calls on June 29th, the day after Seoul was liberated. Workers of the Seoul Electric Power Company, disregarding the bombing by American planes, are carrying out the restoration and construction of tram lines. As of July 2nd, five lines have been restored to traffic. Theaters and cinemas will also begin operating soon.

　　The two democratic newspapers, "Liberation Daily" and "Korean People's Daily," which were founded after the August 15th Liberation but banned by American imperialism, were relaunched in Seoul on the 2nd.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: TASS, Pyongyang, 2nd: Normal life is rapidly returning to the newly liberated areas of South Korea. Residents warmly welcome the restoration of the genuine people's power organs, the People's Committees, and under their guidance, are vigorously rebuilding cities and residential areas, organizing the work of administrative organs, and engaging in cultural life.

　　The residents of Seoul are rapidly repairing the damage caused by the Lee Seung-man's running dogs. The Health Bureau of the Seoul Provisional People's Committee is taking all necessary steps to organize a group of medical service personnel to serve residents who have not had any medical treatment for several years.

　　Thanks to the support of all the people, the necessary conditions have now been created for the normal operation of financial institutions, banks, newspapers, radio stations, and so on.

　　Theaters and cinemas will resume performances in a few days. The People's Committee in the southern part of Yeonbaek County, Hwanghae Province, was restored on June 27th and is now establishing People's Committees in rural areas and villages. More than 1,000 students from the Academy of Political Economy in North Korea, as well as a group of writers and artists, have set off for the liberated areas to help restore the People's Committees, establish normal life, and prepare for land reform.
