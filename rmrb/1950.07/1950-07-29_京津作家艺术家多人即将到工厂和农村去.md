Xinhua News Agency, July 27th—The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government convened a symposium on the 25th in Beijing with over ten writers and artists from Beijing and Tianjin, including Lao She, Cao Yu, Zhao Shuli, Gu Yuan, and Lu Li, who are about to go to factories and rural areas to experience and understand the lives of workers and peasants. Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing presided over the symposium. In his speech, Minister Shen expressed the hope that the writers and artists going down to factories and villages this time could deeply immerse themselves in the lives of the workers and peasants for a long time, and write works that are loved by the masses and cadres and beneficial to them. Regarding the subject matter of writing, he stressed the importance of focusing on what they are familiar with, and that the forms can be of any length, without forcing themselves to write big things. Vice Minister Zhou Yang pointed out in his speech that the main theme of writers' creation should still be about workers, peasants, and soldiers, but this should not be understood in a narrow sense. As long as it does not violate the Common Program, all kinds of themes can be written. The writers and artists present at the meeting expressed their opinions on the issues of creation and literary criticism, and reported their creative plans. The writers going down to factories and villages this time are: Cao Yu will go to the Liulihe Cement Factory, and Zhao Shuli, Gu Yuan, and Lu Li will also go to factories; Hu Danfei, Jia Ke, and Qin Zhaoyang are preparing to go to the Daqing River North area in central Hebei and other old liberated areas to collect materials on the anti-Japanese struggle behind enemy lines. Lao She is currently collecting materials for the construction of new Beijing and plans to write a play entitled "The Transformation of Dragon Beard Ditch."

    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府文化部于二十五日召集北京、天津两地即将到工厂和农村中去体验和了解工农群众生活的作家、艺术家老舍、曹禺、赵树理、古元、鲁藜等十余人举行座谈会。座谈会由文化部沈雁冰部长主持。沈部长在会上发言，希望这次下厂下乡的作家和艺术家能长期深入工农群众的生活，写出为广大群众及干部所爱好并对他们有益的作品。在写作的题材方面，要注意是自己比较熟悉的，形式上大小长短都可以，不必勉强写大东西。周扬副部长在发言中指出，作家们创作的主题，主要还是写工农兵，可是对于这点不应作狭隘的了解。只要是不违反共同纲领，各方面的题材都可以写。到会的作家和艺术家们都对创作和文艺批评问题发表意见，并报告了自己的创作计划。这次下厂下乡的作家：曹禺将去琉璃河水泥厂，赵树理、古元、鲁藜也将到工厂去；胡丹沸、贾克、秦兆阳预备去冀中大清河北及其他老解放区搜集敌后斗争题材。老舍正在搜集建设新北京的材料，计划写一个话剧，剧名为《龙须沟的变迁》。
