The measures are as follows:

The full carload freight charges for tea, brick tea, raw silk (including silk floss, waste silk, twisted silk, warp ends, and native silk), almonds, raw hides, and egg products will be reduced by 50% of the current freight rates. The full carload freight charges for wool, camel hair, tung oil, vegetable oil, tea oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, medicinal materials, casings, walnut kernels, fresh eggs, antimony, cement, etc., will be reduced by 30% of the current freight rates. There are no restrictions on the applicable sections and departure points for the special prices of the above goods, and the designated arrival stations are Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Lianyungang, Qingdao, Tianjin, Tanggu, Qinhuangdao, Yingkou, Andong, Suifenhe, and Manzhouli.
    (2) The special price reduction of 50% for imported cotton freight, which was originally scheduled to be valid until the end of June this year, is now extended to August 31st. The applicable sections are ports and border stations in North China, East China, and Northeast China, with Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Pukou as the delivery locations.
    (3) All less-than-carload shipments of various live fish, fresh fish, frozen fish, fish oil, fish heads, fish fins, fish bones, fish viscera, clam meat, shrimp, and crabs will be charged at 70% of the current freight rates. Motion picture films, movie equipment and accessories for mobile projection teams, cameras, accessories, film, costumes, props, scenery, and medicines for film crews, with certificates from the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, will be charged at the rate of the 14th class of goods, regardless of whether they are full or less-than-carload, on both Northern and Southern Railways. On the Northeast Railway, they will be charged at the 18th class rate (the Northern and Southern Railway freight rates are divided into 20 classes, and the Northeast Railway freight rates are divided into 30 classes). Porcelain and bamboo products, whether full carload or less-than-carload, will be charged at 70% of the current freight rates for the former and 60% for the latter. All of the above have been implemented since July 1st.
    (4) Vaccines and epidemic prevention medicines, when shipped by the Ministry of Health and its affiliated units, and holding certificates from the Ministry of Health, will be calculated at the 14th class of goods rate for both full carload and less-than-carload shipments.

For kiln pillars transported independently by various mines, for full carload transport over 500 kilometers, the 30% reduced rate stipulated in October last year will also be applied.
    In addition, in order to encourage the use of empty return cars, the Railway Ministry has specifically stipulated that red bricks transported from Cangxian, Hebei to Tianjin, and iron pyrite transported from Ma'anshan, Nanjing to Northeast China, will both be reduced by 20% of the current freight rates, beginning in early July.
