　　Sinking an American Cruiser in One Stroke – The Great Feat of the Kim Kun-ok Torpedo Boat Team
    On July 2nd, a certain base on the east coast received intelligence about the appearance of an American cruiser.

    The order to sortie was given.

    Under the command of Torpedo Boat Captain Kim Kun-ok (transliteration), four torpedo boats roared their engines and broke through the raging waves, heading out of the harbor.

    Thanks to regular training, the crew members, with their faces tanned to a steely bronze, looked particularly radiant as they faced the refreshing sea breeze. Their magnificent posture burned with the feeling of loyalty to the motherland and the people.

    Each torpedo boat immediately formed a combat formation, maintained strict vigilance, and advanced forward in search.

    The torpedo boats searched all night but did not easily discover the enemy ships.

    However, the crew's ardent will did not diminish because of this; on the contrary, they continued to advance with a hundred times more courage.

    At this time, the night had passed, and the vast sea had revealed the dawn.

    At 4:00 AM on July 5th, in the red glow of the eastern sea, the American naval cruiser they were so eager to find was finally discovered.

    About ten nautical miles from the sea near Jumunjin, at a direction of thirty degrees, two enemy cruisers and one destroyer were displaying their hateful forms. At this moment, the crew members shouted in unison, "Enemy ships sighted!" The torpedo boats immediately prepared for battle and charged straight towards the enemy ships.

    In an instant, the enemy ships also accelerated towards our torpedo boats, because the enemy had discovered our flotilla. The crew members of our boats were filled with the will to fight the enemy with a common hatred, rubbing their fists and preparing to attack.

    The order to attack was given! Thus began a magnificent naval battle unlike any seen in naval history. Four torpedo boats engaging two cruisers and one destroyer was beyond the norm of modern naval warfare.

    A torpedo boat's surprise attack is not without precedent in naval warfare, but a daylight charge against enemy ships seems to be an unwise strategy.

    However, the incredibly brave naval torpedo boats of our People's Army were unwilling to let the already discovered enemy ships escape. Therefore, regardless of everything, they charged fiercely towards the enemy ships. This boldness and creativity should be immortalized along with the honor of our motherland!

    At this moment, Captain Kim Kun-ok shouted, "Comrades, be calm!" "The time has come to fight for the motherland and the people, for our most beloved leader—General Kim Il-sung! Comrades! Demonstrate selfless bravery!" This encouraged the crew members.

    The torpedo boats broke through the rain of enemy shells and charged to within 1,000 to 800 meters of the enemy ships. The order to launch torpedoes was given, and Boat No. 23, commanded by Captain Choe Jeong-su (transliteration) standing at the bow, charged fiercely towards the enemy cruiser like a flying tiger, launching torpedoes.

    The first torpedo skipped across the surface of the water, roaring with earth-shaking sound, and struck the cruiser. The enemy ship shook after being hit by the torpedo, and then concentrated its fire on our Boat No. 23. Seeing this situation, Captain Kim Kun-ok, in order to disrupt the enemy's concentrated fire, ordered Boat No. 21 to charge fiercely towards the enemy ships. Boat No. 21 instantly approached the enemy ships, aimed at their vital points, launched torpedoes, and then turned to the left, charging between the enemy cruiser and destroyer.

    The enemies were suddenly flustered and fired randomly at our side, thus completely failing to concentrate their fire.

    Taking advantage of this opportunity, Boat No. 22, led by Captain Li Wan-gen (transliteration), also charged to within 900 to 800 meters of the enemy ships, launched a torpedo, and then cleverly hid itself.

    The launched torpedo stirred up a towering water column, hitting the enemy ship and piercing its hull.

    Thus, although the enemy ship was hit by three of our torpedoes, it was not yet sunk.

    The enemy ship continued to fire wildly, and the area around our torpedo boats was filled with water columns, obscuring vision.

    Boat No. 22's Captain Li Wan-gen calmly commanded the torpedo boat, shouting, "Comrades, charge bravely forward!" Then he charged again to within 500 meters of the enemy ships and launched another torpedo. This torpedo made a huge sound, sped towards the enemy ship, and pierced its hull.

    At this moment, the huge hull of the enemy cruiser tilted to one side.

    As a result of five hours of fierce fighting, the ugly enemy cruiser was finally sunk to the bottom of the East Sea at 9:10 AM on the 5th. The naval battle off Jumunjin demonstrated the heroic and indomitable fighting power of the Korean People's Navy.

    When the torpedo boats returned to the coast, shouts of "hurrah" from the base shook the sea.

### 一举击沉美国巡洋舰——金君钰鱼雷艇队的伟绩

　　一举击沉美国巡洋舰
    ——金君钰鱼雷艇队的伟绩
    七月二日东海岸某基地得到了美国巡洋舰出现的情报。
    出动命令下来了。
    四艘鱼雷艇在金君钰（译音）鱼雷艇队长的命令下，响动了引擎，突破怒涛开出海港。
    由于平素的训练，队员们锻炼成钢铁般赤铜色的面孔，迎着爽快的海风，看上去特别光润。他们那种雄伟的姿态，燃烧着为祖国、为人民尽忠的感情。
    各鱼雷艇立刻做好战斗队形，周密戒备，探索着向前进航。
    鱼雷艇通宵探索，没有很容易的发现敌舰。
    可是，队员的激昂意志并没有为之减少，反而英勇百倍的继续前进。
    这时，黑夜已过，茫茫的海面已露出曙光。
    七月五日四时，在东边海面的红霞里，终于发现了急欲寻找的美海军巡洋舰。
    在注文津附近的海上约十海里的地方，三十度的方向上，有两艘敌巡洋舰和一艘驱逐舰在那里显现着可憎的形态。这时，队员们齐声高喊着：“发现敌舰！”鱼雷艇即时备好战斗姿态，直向敌舰猛进。
    转瞬间，敌舰也向我方鱼雷艇加速开近，这是因为敌方已发现了我方的艇群。我艇的队员都充满敌忾同仇的意志，摩拳擦掌，准备突击。
    突击命令下了！立即开始了海战史上所未遇到过的壮烈海战。四艘鱼雷艇，与两艘巡洋舰和一艘驱逐舰交战，是超出近代海战常例的。
    鱼雷艇的奇袭，在海战上不乏其例，但在白昼，向敌舰猛冲，似乎是一种不智的战略。
    可是，英勇无比的我人民军海军鱼雷艇，决不愿使已被发现的敌舰逃脱。所以不顾一切，猛向敌舰冲去。这种大胆性和创造性是应与我们祖国的荣誉一起永垂不朽的！
    这时，金君钰队长高喊：“同志们，要沉着！”“为了祖国和人民，为了我们最敬爱的领袖——金日成将军而战斗的时机到来了！同志们！发挥忘我的勇敢精神吧！”鼓励了队员们。
    鱼雷艇突破如雨一般射来的敌人炮弹，竟冲进到离敌舰一千至八百米的海面。放射鱼雷的命令下了，由崔正洙（译音）艇长站在艇首指挥的二十三号艇，飞虎般的猛向敌巡洋舰突进，放射了鱼雷。
    这第一发鱼雷擦过水面，轰起震海的声响奔驰，命中了巡洋舰。敌舰被鱼雷射中，舰身已震荡，便向我二十三号艇实行集中射击。发现这种情况的金君钰队长，为了扰乱敌人的集中射击，命令二十一号艇猛向敌舰冲入。二十一号艇瞬即冲近敌舰，瞄准敌舰要害，放射鱼雷后，转向左方，冲进了敌巡洋舰和驱逐舰中间。
    敌人们顿然张慌失措，向我方胡乱发射炮火，这样，敌人的集中射击完全失败了。
    趁这时机，由李完根（译音）艇长率领的二十二号艇也冲近到离敌舰九百到八百米的海面，放射了一发鱼雷，又立刻很灵巧的躲藏起来了。
    所放射的鱼雷激起冲天的水柱，命中了敌舰，射穿了舰腹。
    这样，敌舰虽被我方鱼雷打中三发，但还没被击沉。
    敌舰继续疯狂的乱发炮弹，我方雷艇的周围充满了水柱，不辨咫尺。
    二十二号艇李完根艇长更沉静地指挥着雷艇呼喊：“同志们，勇敢的向前冲吧！”接着再冲到距敌舰五百米的海面，又发射了一发鱼雷。这发鱼雷发出巨响，驶到敌舰，贯穿了敌舰腹部。
    这时，敌巡洋舰的庞大舰身向一面倾倒。
    前后激战五小时的结果，丑恶的敌巡洋舰，终于在五日九时十分，深葬在东海海底。注文津的海上战斗显示了朝鲜人民海军英勇和百折不挠的战斗力量。
    鱼雷艇返回海岸的时候，基地上高呼万岁之声，震动了海面。
