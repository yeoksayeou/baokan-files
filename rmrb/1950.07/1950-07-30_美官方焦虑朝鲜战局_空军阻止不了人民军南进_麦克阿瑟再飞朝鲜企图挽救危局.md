　　US Officials Anxious About Korean War Situation
    Air Force Unable to Stop People's Army Advance South
    MacArthur Flies to Korea Again in Attempt to Salvage the Situation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] The continuous southward advance of the Korean People's Army has caused serious anxiety among the US ruling group. According to a United Press report: Short, a senior Republican on the House Military Committee, said in the House of Representatives on the 25th with a "worried face": "In a few days, US troops in Korea may be driven into the sea." Short heavily attacked the US State Department and the Department of the Army, and demanded a "thorough reorganization" of the State Department and the Department of Defense. Short made these remarks after attending a "secret briefing" by the Department of Defense with other members of Congress. After the meeting, another congressman "who did not want to be named" said: "The heads of the Department of Defense do not seem as optimistic as before."
    According to an Associated Press reporter's dispatch from Washington on the 26th: "The optimism that the Pentagon (the location of the US Department of Defense) had about the Korean War has now taken on a somewhat depressed atmosphere due to the continuous victories of the communist forces in breaking through and encircling US defense lines." The reporter revealed that although senior US officials still publicly stated that "US troops will be able to hold a bridgehead and use it to counterattack in the future," they privately said in an uncertain tone: "Whether the United States can win the beachhead war can be decided in three weeks." The reporter also stated: "The fact that the US Air Force has in fact gained an unmatched advantage in Korea for four weeks, and that the communist army (referring to the Korean People's Army) is still able to win battles and strategies against the Eighth Army, is indeed a perplexing and painful experience."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo: MacArthur flew to Korea again on the 27th in an attempt to salvage the deteriorating situation of the repeatedly defeated US invading forces.
    In Korea, MacArthur held talks with Walker, Stratemeyer, Partridge, and Muccio, the "ambassador" of the US-backed South Korean puppet government, who were the top leaders of the US invading forces' land and air forces. He then hastily flew back to Tokyo that afternoon.

　　美官方焦虑朝鲜战局
    空军阻止不了人民军南进
    麦克阿瑟再飞朝鲜企图挽救危局
    【新华社二十九日讯】朝鲜人民军的长驱南下，已引起美国统治集团的严重焦虑。据合众社讯：美国众院军事委员会高级共和党人萧特二十五日在众院“愁眉苦脸”地说：“不要几天，美国在朝鲜的部队就可能被驱逐到海里去”。萧特对美国国务院和陆军部大加攻击，并要求“彻底整顿”国务院和国防部。萧特是在和其他一些议员出席国防部的“秘密汇报”后发表此议论的。会后，另一位“不愿露姓名”的众议员说：“国防部首长们看来已不像从前那样乐观了”。
    据美联社记者二十六日亦自华盛顿报道：“五角大楼（美国防部所在地）对朝鲜战争所抱的乐观态度，现在已因共军在突破与包围美军防线中的不断获胜而呈若干沮丧的气氛。”该记者透露，美国高级官员们在公开的场合虽仍表示“美军必能坚守一个桥头阵地，将来据以反攻”，但他们在私下却以不敢肯定的语调说：“美国能否在滩头战争中获胜，可以在三个星期中决定。”该记者并称：“美国空军事实上在朝鲜获得不能匹敌的优势已有四周，而共军（按指朝鲜人民军）现在仍然能在战斗与策略上打胜第八军，实在是一个使人迷惑不解的惨痛经历。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】据法新社东京讯：麦克阿瑟于二十七日再度飞赴朝鲜，企图挽救美国侵略军一再溃败的危局。
    麦克阿瑟在朝鲜曾与美国侵略部队的陆空军首要瓦克、斯特拉特梅耶、伯特利基及美国驻南朝鲜伪政府“大使”缪锡俄等举行会谈。并于当日下午匆匆飞回东京。
