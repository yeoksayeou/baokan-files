    Shortcomings in the Work of Shengfang People's Hospital
    A Reader Hopes the Hospital Authorities Will Conduct an Inspection
    The Tianjin Special District People's Hospital in Shengfang Town has had many serious shortcomings in its work for more than a year. First, treatment is very untimely and perfunctory. For example, Ma Shude, a cadre of the Shengfang Women's Federation, suffered from chest distension and her condition was very serious. On June 3rd, she was carried to the hospital, but no doctor came to examine or treat her for an entire day. Wang Xiuzhen, a women's cadre of the Shengfang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, was admitted to the hospital for four days before a doctor came to examine her, causing her a lot of unnecessary suffering. At the same time, they often do not carefully understand the patient's condition, but just give some medicine to get by, so that some patients' conditions worsen after being admitted to the hospital. For example, Gong Rongfang from Tianjin suffered from stomach problems. When she was admitted to the hospital, she could walk three *li*, but after staying for a month, she couldn't even walk back from a trip to the street. Pregnant women in the hospital have to set up their own stoves and start their own fires, which is very difficult, and the hospital does not provide very good assistance. Secondly, the ideological education of the staff is very poor. For example, in May, patient Liu Xijin saw four used injection needles in a dirty water bucket and reported it to the hospital, but they did not investigate the reason. In one month from mid-May to early June, the hospital was robbed three times: in mid-May, patient Huang Yuqin had 24,000 yuan stolen from her in the ward; at the end of May, patient Wang Xiuzhen had 30,000 yuan stolen; and in early June, patient Cheng Yuying had a fountain pen stolen. The hospital has not yet investigated and dealt with these problems.
    It is hoped that Shengfang People's Hospital will conduct an inspection of its work to overcome the existing shortcomings.

　　胜芳人民医院工作有缺点
    一读者希望该院当局进行检查
    胜芳镇上的天津专区人民医院，一年多以来，工作中仍存在许多严重的缺点。首先，就是治疗很不及时和草率。如胜芳妇女会干部马树德，患了胸部胀满的病，病况非常严重。六月三日她被抬到该院，直等了一整天，仍没有医生来检查和治疗。胜芳供销社妇女干部王秀珍入院四天后，才有医生来检查，她受了很多不必要的痛苦。同时，他们对病人往往不仔细了解病况，就给点药支应过去，以致有些病员，入院以后，病势反而加重起来。如天津龚荣芳患了胃病，入院时还能走三里路，住了一个月，到街里玩一趟，就走不回去了。住院的产妇，要自己安锅起伙，困难很多，院方也不很好给以帮助。其次对工作人员的思想教育工作做得很差。如五月份病员刘喜金看见脏水桶里有四个注射针头，报告给院部，他们也不追究原因。五月中旬到六月初的一个月中，该院失盗三次：五月中旬病员黄玉琴在病房中被偷去了二万四千元；五月底病员王秀珍被偷去了三万元；六月初病员程玉英被偷去了一枝钢笔。现在对于这些问题院方都未进行调查处理。
    希望胜芳人民医院对该院工作进行一次检查，克服现有的缺点。
