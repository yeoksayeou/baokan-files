Implementing the Principle of Overall Consideration
    Shijiazhuang Adjusts Public-Private Relations
    Appropriately Stipulates Wholesale and Retail Price Differences
    [This newspaper, Shijiazhuang News] State-owned enterprises in Shijiazhuang are actively adjusting public-private relations under the principle of overall consideration.

    Firstly, regarding the processing issue of private cotton weaving industry (excluding Da Xing), a contract has been preliminarily drafted after repeated consultations among various parties. The term is six months, with more than 3,600 bolts of cloth with the width of 2.7 feet to be processed each month. At the same time, it also pointed out that some phenomena of cutting corners in the past were wrong, and it is necessary to ensure weaving according to standards and improve quality in the future.

    In adjusting the sales market, the number of retail stores will be reduced to twenty-two. All consignment goods beyond the scope of business will be completely returned to the original consignment company before June 20.

    Retail prices and wholesale prices have also been preliminarily adjusted. The adjusted difference in the retail company is: flour 4% to 5.52%, Wufushan Deer White Cloth is 2.5%, other cloth is 4.6% to 5.7%, kerosene is 7.2%, various coals are 4.2% to 7%, towels, alkali noodles, various sugars are 6.4% to 8.3%. The department store has adjusted more than 1,000 kinds of commodities; several major commodities among them are 6% to 10%. The Flower and Cotton Yarn Company has also made adjustments except for Wufushan Deer White Cloth. The rest remains to be adjusted continuously.

    In bank loans, the Shijiazhuang Office of the People's Bank of China loaned 3,007,700,000 yuan in the first half of June, of which private enterprises accounted for 33.3%. The focus of support is the ironwork, oil pressing, electric mill, cotton weaving, and wood factory industries, especially the iron industry with loans of more than 288 million yuan, accounting for 28.2% of the total private loans. The purpose is mostly to purchase raw materials and help with capital turnover. This has played a significant role in maintaining industrial production.

    However, looking at the proportion of industrial and commercial loans, industry accounts for 41.15% and commerce accounts for 58.85%. The proportion of commercial loans is relatively large, which is due to the current support for exports and helping some businesses solve the difficulty of capital turnover. In the future, industry should be the focus of support based on the actual situation.

　　贯彻统筹兼顾原则
    石市调整公私关系
    适当规定批发零售物价差额
    【本报石家庄讯】石市各国营企业在统筹兼顾的原则下，正积极调整公私关系。
    首先对于私营棉织业（大兴除外）的加工问题，经过各方面多次协商，已初步拟定合同，期限六个月，每月加工布三千六百余匹，宽度为二尺七寸。同时，也指出过去某些偷工减料的现象是错误的，今后要保证按标准织，提高质量。
    在调整销售市场上，零售店将减至二十二个。凡经营范围以外的代销货品，于六月二十日前，完全交回原代销公司。
    零售价与批发价亦已初步调整，零售公司调整的差额是：面粉百分之四至五．五二，五福山鹿白布是百分之二．五，其他布百分之四．六至五．七，煤油百分之七．二，各种煤炭百分之四．二至七，毛巾、碱面、各种糖百分之六．四至八．三。百货公司一千多种商品均已作了调整；其中几种主要商品是百分之六至一○。花纱布公司除去五福山鹿白布外，也作了调整。其余尚待继续调整。
    银行贷款中六月上半月人民银行石市办事处贷出款三○○、七七○万元，其中私营占百分之三三．三。扶植的重点是铁工、榨油、电磨、棉织、木厂等行业，尤其是铁工业贷款二亿八千余万元，占私营放款总额的百分之二八．二。其用途多为购买原料、帮助资金流转等。这对工业维持生产是起了很大作用的。
    但从工商业贷款比重上看，工业占百分之四一．一五，商业占百分之五八．八五，商业放款的比重较大，这是由于目前在扶植出口及帮助一部分商业解决资金周转不灵的困难所致。今后当视实际情况以工业为扶植重点。
