Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Public opinion in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries unanimously supports the statement made by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko regarding the American aggression against Korea, according to TASS reports.

Polish People's Forum published an editorial on July 7th entitled "American Aggressors Have Forgotten the Lessons of History," stating: Gromyko's statement exposed the aggressors before world opinion. The American aggressors actually want to turn the entire Korea into a military base, a base like the one during the Japanese imperialist occupation. However, the American imperialists have forgotten the lessons of history. They have forgotten that Japanese imperialists attempted to play a similar role and were defeated. They have forgotten that the United States sided with Chiang Kai-shek to interfere in China, and ended in a shameful defeat. They have forgotten that the United States and other imperialists interfered in the Soviet Union after the victory of the revolution, and as a result, the invaders were driven out of Soviet territory.

The Soviet Union steadfastly pursues a policy of peace and never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. The Soviet government recognizes that the Korean people have the same rights as the American people to unite their country into a single nation, just as the Americans did in the last century. The Soviet government's position, as clarified in Gromyko's statement, is the opinion of all peace defenders. It has won the unanimous support of People's Poland.

Czechoslovakian Ministry of National Defense's newspaper, People's Defense Line, published a commentary entitled "The Result of the War of Aggression Against the Asian People Will Be the Failure of the Imperialists," pointing out: Gromyko's statement clearly states that the American government, which committed the crime of aggression, should be responsible for the consequences of the aggression against Korea. The American imperialists are making a military gamble. The only result of this gamble will be their failure.

The Hungarian Latest News editorial stated: Gromyko's statement has strengthened the peace movement led by the Soviet Union and opened up new horizons for it.

The Bulgarian Communist Party's newspaper, Worker's Cause, stated in its editorial: The Bulgarian people are watching the struggle of the Korean people against the traitorous Syngman Rhee gang and their American masters with deep sympathy. Six million Bulgarian citizens who signed the peace declaration today expressed their determination to stand in solidarity with the Korean people.

　　波捷匈保等国舆论
    拥护葛罗米柯声明  痛斥美帝侵略朝鲜
    【新华社十日讯】综合塔斯社消息：波、捷、匈、保等国的舆论，一致拥护苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯就美国侵略朝鲜所发表的声明。
    波兰人民论坛报七日以“美国侵略者忘却了历史的教训”为题发表社论称：葛罗米柯的声明，在全世界舆论面前揭发了侵略者。美国侵略者实际上是要把整个朝鲜变成军事基地，变成像日本帝国主义占领时代那样的基地。然而，美帝国主义者却忘却了历史的教训。它忘却了日本帝国主义者曾企图担当类似的脚色而被打垮了。它忘却了美国站在蒋介石一边干涉中国，最后是可耻的失败了。它忘却了美国及其他帝国主义者们干涉革命胜利后的苏联，结果是侵略者们被从苏维埃领土上驱逐出去了。
    苏联坚守不渝地奉行和平政策，始终不干涉他国的内政。苏联政府承认朝鲜人民赋有和美国人同样的权利，来把自己的国家统一成单一的国家，正如美国人在上一世纪所作过的一样。葛罗米柯的声明中所阐明的苏联政府的立场，就是一切和平保卫者的意见。它已博得了人民波兰的一致拥护。
    捷克斯洛伐克国防部机关报人民防线报以“反对亚洲人民的侵略战争的结果，将是帝国主义者的失败”为题，发表评论指出：葛罗米柯的声明清楚地说明犯侵略罪的美国政府，对侵略朝鲜的行为的结果应负责任。美帝国主义者正在作军事上的赌博。这种赌博的唯一结果就是他们的失败。
    匈牙利最新新闻报的社论称：葛罗米柯的声明加强了以苏联为首的和平运动，并使其展开了新的视野。
    保加利亚共产党机关报工人事业报的社论称：保加利亚人民怀着深切的同情，注视着朝鲜人民对叛国的李承晚匪帮及其美国主子的斗争。六百万在和平宣言上签名的保加利亚公民，今天表明了他们和朝鲜人民团结一致的决心。
