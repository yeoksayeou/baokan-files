　　Our Troops Stationed in Southern and Western Yunnan
    Conscientiously Implement Ethnic Policies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 18th dispatch] After the Yunnan Military Region troops of the People's Liberation Army were stationed in the ethnic minority areas on the borders of western and southern Yunnan, they conscientiously implemented ethnic policies and observed mass discipline, deeply loved by the people of all ethnic groups. When the PLA troops stationed in Cheli and Fohai in southern Yunnan were dispersed to suppress bandits, each unit organized a folk customs investigation team. Before entering a village, they would introduce the local customs and habits to the commanders and fighters and point out precautions. As soon as the commanders and fighters arrived in the villages, they helped the masses clear garbage, sweep courtyards and streets, tidy up furniture, and often filled the residents' water tanks. All proclamations and leaflets of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army were printed in both Chinese and Pai Yi languages ​​and there were special personnel to explain them to the residents. When the masses in Pusheng Dam held a ceremony for monks to enter the temple, everyone was required to participate in the celebration according to custom. The local garrison immediately promoted respect for the customs of fraternal ethnic groups. Many Pai Yi compatriots jumped up with joy. The Grand Buddha (Pai Yi monk), who never easily met strangers, also came out to listen to the soldiers. Under the influence of the brotherly friendship of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of ethnic minority compatriots accused the bandits of robbing their livestock and money, and expressed their determination to support the army in wiping out the bandits. Some brought chickens and eggs to comfort the troops, shouting, "The death day of the old yellow dog (referring to the bandits) has arrived, our army has come, and we are coming out on top!" The Kawa people in the area gave the troops a sickle and two hoes, explaining that the sickle was to cut off feudalism and one hoe was to dig out the Chiang root (meaning to completely eliminate the Chiang bandit gang), and one hoe was to develop great production and build a new Sipu (i.e. Simao Pu'er Special District).
    When the troops entered Nanding area of ​​Baoshan border defense zone in western Yunnan, the Tusi of Lianshan and Yingjiang came to Nanding to greet them. The father and son of Nanding Tusi Xishou, who had fled due to the deception and propaganda of the Chiang bandits, immediately returned after learning about the troops' stationing and were warmly received by the troops. The Nanding People's Government convened a meeting of representatives of all ethnic groups from the nine townships under the jurisdiction of the original Lianghe Administration Bureau to explain the ethnic policies in the Common Program. More than 80 Yi representatives attended the meeting, and all unanimously expressed their willingness to build a new western Yunnan together under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

　　进驻滇南滇西我军
    认真执行民族政策
    【新华社昆明十八日电】人民解放军云南军区部队进驻滇西、滇南边陲少数民族地区后，认真执行民族政策，贯彻群众纪律，深受各族人民衷心的爱戴。进驻滇南车里、佛海的解放军在分散剿匪情况下，各部都组织了民情风俗调查组，每进一村就向指战员们介绍当地风俗习惯，提出注意事项。指战员们一到各村后即帮助群众清除垃圾，打扫院落街道，整理家具，并经常替居民把水缸挑满。人民政府和解放军所有布告和传单均同时采用汉文和摆夷文印出，并有专人解释给居民们听。普胜坝群众举行和尚入寺典礼时，依照习俗任何人都必须参加庆祝，当地驻军就当场宣传尊重兄弟民族的风俗，很多摆夷同胞高兴地跳了起来，向来不轻易出面见生人的大佛爷（摆夷和尚）也走出来听战士们讲话。广大少数民族同胞在解放军兄弟般友谊的影响下，纷纷控诉土匪抢劫他们的牲畜和钱财的罪行，表示一定支援大军肃清土匪。有的拿出鸡子、鸡蛋来慰劳部队，高呼“老黄狗（指土匪）的死日到了，我们的军队来了，我们出头了啊。”该地区卡瓦族人民送给部队一把镰刀、两把锄头，并解释说：镰刀是叫大军割断封建，一把锄头是叫大军挖断蒋根（意把蒋匪帮彻底消灭），一把锄头开展大生产，建设新思普（即思茅普洱专区）。
    部队进入滇西保山边防区南甸一带时，莲山、盈江的土司亲来南甸迎接。因受蒋匪欺骗宣传而逃跑了的南甸土司袭授父子，在了解部队进驻情况后，立刻相率归来，受到部队热烈的招待。南甸人民政府召开了原梁河设治局所辖九个乡镇的各族代表会议，讲解共同纲领中的民族政策。到会彝族代表八十余人，均一致表示愿在共产党及人民政府领导下，共同建设新滇西。
