　　Beijing's Formal Spare-Time Education Work in the Last Six Months
　　Ma Ju
　　The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in implementing the resolutions of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference (First Session), has established 46 formal spare-time schools in the past six months (excluding those independently established by various government departments). A total of 605 elementary classes and 86 intermediate classes have been opened. The number of students enrolled is 30,156, of which 23,388 are industrial workers, accounting for 77.6 percent of the total; 4,873 are government cadres, accounting for 16.1 percent; and 1,895 are government support staff, accounting for 6.3 percent. There are 27,081 male students and 3,075 female students.
　　Leadership and Organization
　　Leading and promoting the city's formal spare-time education work is the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Spare-Time Education Work Committee. This organization was formed in February this year by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, which invited the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Municipal Education Workers' Union, and other relevant units. Vice Mayor Wu Han serves as the director, and Liao Mosha, Liu Laifu, Weng Dujian, and Zhang Xiaomei serve as deputy directors. The Work Committee has a standing committee, and under the standing committee are four departments: the Education Department, the General Affairs Department, the Secretariat, and the Research Office. The Work Committee's working principle is to target industrial workers and government cadres, and to conduct formal, conditional learning, focusing on cultural studies, outside of production and work hours.
　　The 46 formal spare-time schools directly under the leadership of the Spare-Time Education Work Committee come in three different forms. The first is established independently by a single factory or government department. The second is established jointly by several factories. The third is established by each administrative district, jointly by the factories and government departments in that district. Each school is composed of a school affairs committee jointly formed by the party, government, labor union, youth league, teachers, and student representatives of the school, which leads and resolves all major issues in the school and is headed by an administrative leader who concurrently serves as the principal. This kind of organization, because it includes responsible comrades from all sides, obtains assistance and cooperation from all sides, enabling the work to proceed smoothly and effectively. The school affairs committee has an education department, headed by a full-time education director, who leads the teaching and academic affairs of the entire school. Each class has a homeroom teacher, who is a full-time teacher, and leads the learning of the entire class. The students in each class are divided into several groups according to their work department and residential area, and each group elects a group leader to promote the learning of the whole group. This learning group organization plays a significant role in ensuring the adherence to the learning system and enhancing the learning enthusiasm.
　　The criteria for class assignment are based on three conditions: the students' educational level, their spare time, their address, and the classroom capacity. The students' educational level is based on Chinese language and arithmetic. In order to accommodate the uneven level of students in these two subjects, the two courses can be taught at different grade levels, while other courses are determined by the Chinese language class.
　　The teaching materials are compiled and printed by a compilation committee jointly formed by the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education of the Central Government, the Department of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Spare-Time Education Work Committee, according to the prescribed academic system and curriculum. A complete set of elementary spare-time school teaching materials has been compiled and printed, including nine volumes of Chinese language, nine volumes of arithmetic, and six volumes of general knowledge. As of now, 42,353 copies have been distributed.
　　The source of funding is mostly government subsidies, with a small portion from the cultural and educational funds of the labor union and administrative subsidies from factories or government departments. The government's subsidy to each school is currently 99,034 catties of millet per month, accounting for 82.3 percent of the total expenditure on spare-time education. In addition, start-up funds of 46,622 catties of millet have been subsidized to 22 schools.
　　Teachers and Teaching
　　Spare-time schools currently have 463 teachers, of which 195 are full-time teachers, accounting for 42.1 percent of the total, and 268 are part-time teachers. Full-time teachers are recruited uniformly by the Spare-Time Education Work Committee, and each teacher has been reviewed and has a certain professional level. Half of them have a university degree or above, and half have a high school normal school degree. Two-thirds have teaching experience, and they are responsible for teaching two-thirds of all courses. Part-time teachers are hired by the schools themselves, mostly cadres currently employed, and a small number are students from universities and middle schools. Before being assigned to work, full-time teachers attended a short-term training class organized by the Spare-Time Education Work Committee, which gave them a preliminary understanding of the significance, characteristics, principles, and methods of spare-time education work. Teachers in spare-time schools are not only responsible for teaching, but also for building schools and carrying out cultural and educational work for workers. This has greatly increased their work enthusiasm and initiative. Therefore, teachers are generally active, open-minded, and responsible in their work.
　　Strengthening the connection between teachers and students and fostering good teacher-student relations is the primary condition for good teaching and good learning. Most of the teachers in spare-time schools are old intellectuals with low levels of political thought. The teacher-student relationship is actually a problem of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants. This is a long-term endeavor. Only by continuously improving the political thought and professional level of teachers, and by continuously maintaining and promoting the students' full learning enthusiasm and correct learning attitude, can a close and seamless teaching relationship be truly established. In this regard, the preliminary work done by spare-time schools for teachers is: First, to make them actively approach and understand students, integrate with them, and experience their lives and thoughts. For example, many teachers at the Fengtai Railway Station Spare-Time School and the Dongcheng Five Factories Joint Spare-Time School actively tutored students outside of class. Teachers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory Spare-Time School participated in the factory's labor union and the democratic management movement of the factory. Second, the system of preparing lessons and criticism and self-criticism has been universally established. Collective preparation of lessons before class, a humble and honest attitude in teaching, and the promotion of democracy, listening to students' opinions at any time and making improvements. On the student side, students are educated to put down the baggage of "old revolutionaries" who despise intellectuals, respect teachers, learn humbly, abide by learning discipline, and actively help teachers.
　　In terms of teaching methods, because formal spare-time schools are newly established, there is not yet comprehensive and mature experience, but the following issues have been experienced in the past six months:
　　(1) Special attention should be paid to the connection between theory and practice. Adults have a greater need for practice than children, and this must be noted. Chinese language and mathematics should teach more applied writing and applied problems, and use more practice methods. Natural teaching should pay attention to improving from the basis of adults' life experience, use more experimental methods, and add necessary wall charts and instruments.
　　(2) Teaching materials should be used flexibly, and more supplementary teaching materials should be selected. Do not be bound by textbooks, because a unified teaching material is difficult to relate to the individual needs of students.
　　(3) Attention should be paid to taking care of students' levels and requirements. In principle, classes should be divided as much as possible so that the levels of students in the same class are not too different. However, due to differences in students' education, age, work, ability to accept, and interest requirements, the levels of students in the same class are still uneven. Therefore, in teaching, attention should be paid to taking care of the majority, appropriately grasping the progress, and for those with lower levels, individual assistance and the organization of mutual learning assistance should be adopted to solve the problem.
　　(4) Teaching should pay special attention to saving time, and the teaching method should be lively and vivid. Students work hard all day and squeeze out some time to learn. If teachers are listless, full of empty words, and do not pay attention to teaching effectiveness, students will become bored.
　　Absence Problem
　　Student absenteeism is a very common phenomenon in spare-time schools, with absence rates ranging from 2 to 25 percent in various schools. How to reduce student absenteeism is a major issue for spare-time schools. The objective reasons for student absenteeism mostly arise from the contradiction between work and time, and the time taken up by meetings. The subjective reasons are: First, the Party, government, labor unions, and youth leagues do not effectively guarantee students' learning time, and do not care about or even neglect students' learning; second, the schools themselves have shortcomings, such as teachers not teaching well, students not being interested in the subjects, etc.; third, some students do not have enough understanding of the importance of learning culture, do not have the spirit of perseverance, or the student organization is not sound enough, especially private industrial workers, who are scattered and difficult to organize.
　　It is impossible to completely eliminate or greatly reduce absenteeism in spare-time schools. However, striving to reduce the absenteeism rate is entirely possible and necessary. Based on past experience, the Spare-Time Education Work Committee has put forward four directions of effort for how to achieve this in the future and how to remedy the phenomenon of absenteeism: (1) Maintain close contact with the Party, government, labor unions, and youth leagues, and strive for their frequent care and encouragement for students in spare-time schools. Guarantee students' learning time and effectively implement the provisions of the State Council's directive on developing spare-time education for workers and staff, which stipulate that "those who participate in learning on learning days should not be required to work extra overtime and should be exempt from participating in various meeting activities." (2) Better organize the students, encourage and help each other, and take the lead through activists, and organize competitions for non-absenteeism when possible. To stimulate their enthusiasm for learning and correct deviations in learning. (3) Improve school teaching work, improve the school committee, strengthen the connection between the school and various administrative units, and between the school and students, and establish a leave system. (4) Establish a thorough and regular tutoring system. In terms of methods, it is necessary to make it systematic, and in terms of strength, do our best to mobilize intellectuals from government departments and factories, especially members of the Communist Youth League, to do this work together.
　　In the past six months, formal spare-time education work has achieved great results in terms of school construction. The main task of spare-time education work in the future is to consolidate schools and gradually develop them. In order to accomplish this task, the Spare-Time Education Work Committee is, on the one hand, systematically improving the ideological and professional level of teachers, and on the other hand, is establishing inspection work, through which to check and improve the work of various spare-time schools.

　　北京市半年来的正规业余教育工作
    马句
    北京市人民政府执行北京市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议的决议，半年以来，开办正规业余学校四十六校（不包括各机关自行开办的），共开设初级班六○五班，中级班八六班。入校学生有三○、一五六人，其中产业工人二三、三八八人，占总人数的百分之七七点六，机关干部四、八七三人，占百分之一六点一，机关勤杂人员一、八九五人，占百分之六点三。男生二七、○八一人，女生三、○七五人。
    领导与组织
    领导与推动全市正规业余教育工作的是北京市人民政府业余教育工作委员会。这个机构是今年二月由北京市人民政府邀请市总工会、青年团市工委会、市民主妇联、市教育工作者工会及其他有关单位共同组成的。吴晗副市长任主任，廖沫沙、刘莱夫、翁独健、张晓梅任副主任。工委会设常委，常委会下面设教务处、总务处、秘书室与研究室四个部门。业余教育工作委员会的工作方针是以产业工人和机关干部为对象，在生产和工作的时间之外，进行以文化学习为主的有条件的正规化学习。
    在业余教育工作委员会直接领导下的四十六个正规业余学校，共有三种不同的形式，第一种是以一个工厂或机关单独成立的。第二种是以几个工厂联合成立的。第三种是以行政区为单位，由各该区的各工厂和机关联合成立的。每个学校由该校的党、政、工、团及教师与学生代表共同组成校务委员会，领导解决学校中的一切重大问题，并由行政上的负责同志兼任校长。这样的组织，因为它包括了各方面的负责同志，取得了各方面的协助和配合，使工作能顺利而有效地进行。校委会下设教务处，由专人作教务主任，领导全校教学业务。各班有班主任，由专任教员担任，领导全班学习。各班学生按照工作部门与居住地区分成若干小组，每组选小组长一人，推动全组学习，这个学习小组的组织在保证坚持学习制度和提高学习情绪方面起了很大作用。
    编班的标准，是根据学生的文化程度、学生的业余时间、住址和教室容量三个条件编成的，学生的文化程度是以国语和算术为标准，为了照顾学生在这两科上的程度不齐，两种课程可在不同年级上课，其他课程是根据国语班而定的。
    教材是根据规定的学制与课程，由中央教育部社教司、全国总工会文教部与业余教育工作委员会三单位共同组成的编委会编印的，共编印国文九册、算术九册、常识六册的全套初级业余学校教材。截至现在已发行四二、三五三册。
    经费的来源大部分是政府补助的，有一小部分是工会文教费的一部分和工厂或机关的行政方面的补助。政府补助各校的经费目前每月为九万九千零三十四斤小米，占业余教育经费总开支的百分之八二点三，另外还补助了二十二个学校的开办费四万六千六百二十二斤小米。
    教员与教学
    业余学校现有教员四六三人，其中专任教员一九五人，占全数的百分之四二点一，兼任教员二六八人。专任教员是由业余教育工作委员会统一招聘的，每个教员都经过审查，具有一定的业务水平，其中大学以上程度与高中师范程度各占一半，有教学经验的占三分之二，担任授课时数占全部课程的三分之二。兼任教员由各校自行聘请，大部分为在职干部，小部分为大中学校学生。专任教员在分发工作之前，曾由业余教育工作委员会举办了一个短期的训练班，使教员对于业余教育工作的意义、特点、方针和方法都有了一个初步的认识；业余学校的教员，不只是单纯的负责教书，而且还要负责建校和开展工人文教工作。这样就大大地提高了他们的工作积极性和主动性，因此一般教员在工作上都很积极虚心、负责。
    加强师生之间的联系，搞好师生关系是教好学好的首要条件。业余学校的教员多数是政治思想水平不高的旧知识分子，师生关系实际上是一个知识分子与工农相结合的问题，这是一个长期努力的过程，只有不断的提高教员的政治思想和业务水平不断的保持与发扬学员的饱满的学习情绪和正确的学习态度，才能真正建立密切无间的教学关系。业余学校在这方面对于教员所作的初步工作是：第一、使他们主动地接近和了解学生，与学生打成一片，体验他们的生活和思想。例如丰台车站业余学校。东城五厂联合业余学校的很多教员，在上课之外主动地替学生补课，石景山钢铁厂业余学校的教员参加了工厂的工会和该厂的民主管理运动。第二、普遍地建立了准备功课和批评与自我批评的制度，在上课之前集体准备功课，在教学态度上要谦虚老实，并发扬民主，随时听取学生意见，加以改进。对于学生方面，教育学生放下“老革命”轻视知识分子的包袱，尊敬教员，虚心学习，遵守学习纪律，积极帮助教员。
    在教学方法方面，因为正规的业余学校是初创，还没有取得全面的成熟经验，但半年来已体验到了以下几个问题：
    （１）要特别注意理论与实践的联系。成人比儿童更有实践的需要，必须注意到这一点。国文与数学多教应用文和应用题，多用练习方法。自然教学应注意从成人的生活经验的基础上提高，多用实验方法，添置必要的挂图和仪器。
    （２）要活用教材，多选补助教材，不要为课本所拘束，因为一种统一的教材很难与学员的个别需要相联系。
    （３）要注意照顾学生的程度和要求，原则上应尽可能的多分班次，使同班的学生的程度相差不大。但因学生的学历、年龄、工作、接受能力与兴趣要求的不同，同班的学生的程度还是参差不齐。因此在教学中要注意照顾多数，适当地掌握进度，对程度较低的，则采取个别帮助和组织学习互助等方法来解决。
    （４）教学要特别注意经济时间，教学方式要生动活泼。学生勤劳终日挤出一些时间来进行学习，如果教员没精打彩，空话连篇，不讲究教学效果，就会使学生发生厌倦情形。
    缺课问题
    业余学校学生缺课是一个很普遍的现象，各校缺课率由百分之二到百分之二十五不等。如何减少学生的缺课是业余学校的一个重大问题。学生缺课的客观原因，多半产生于工作与时间的矛盾，和学生时间为开会时间所占。主观原因是：第一、党、政、工、团对学生的学习时间没有切实的保障，对学生学习不关心甚至忽视；第二、学校本身有缺点，如教员教的不好，学生对功课不感兴趣等；第三、有些学生对学习文化的认识不够，没有坚持精神或学员组织不够健全，特别是私营产业工人，单位分散，组织困难。
    对业余学校要求完全消灭或大量减少缺课现象是不可能的。但努力争取降低缺课率是完全可能而必要的。今后如何做到这一点和如何补救缺课现象，业余教育工作委员会根据过去经验提出四个努力的方向：（１）与党、政、工、团密切联系，争取他们对业余学校学生经常关心、鼓励。保障学生的学习时间，切实执行政务院关于开展职工业余教育指示中规定的：“在学习日参加学习者，可不作额外加班，并免除其参加各种会议活动的工作。”（２）把学员更好地组织起来，互相督促帮助，通过积极分子带头，可能时组织不缺课的竞赛。以启发他们的学习热情，纠正学习中的偏向。（３）改进学校教学工作，健全校委会密切学校与各行政单位，学校与学员之间的联系，建立请假制度。（４）建立周密而经常的补课制度，在方法上一定要作到制度化，在力量上要尽力发动机关和工厂的知识分子，特别是青年团员，来共同作这个工作。
    半年以来，正规业余教育工作在建校方面已经获到了很大的成绩，今后业余教育工作的主要任务是巩固学校，逐步发展。为了完成这个任务，业余教育工作委员会一方面正在有计划地提高教员的思想业务水平，一方面正在建立视导工作，通过这个工作去检查并改进各业余学校的工作。
