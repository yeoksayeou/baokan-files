    Commemorating "July 1st" and Guaranteeing Stepped-Up Production and Learning
    The Tanshan Village Branch in Wanxian County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting: The branch has launched a "three comparisons" movement: comparing production, comparing work, and comparing learning. In terms of production, the whole village planted 582 mu of cotton, exceeding the task by nearly double, and guaranteed that there would be no weeds in the fields. Party member cadres carried out propaganda work anytime and anywhere, publicizing the Party's 29 years of struggle history and various policies. Party members regularly attended Party classes and cultural classes. The branch called on each Party member to learn one character every day, striving to eliminate illiteracy within two or three years.

    The Jiajia Village Branch in Xinhe County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao wishing him good health, reporting on the completion of tasks such as production, disaster relief, political construction, and youth league construction. They also guaranteed to Chairman Mao: to improve the political understanding of Party members, to closely link with the masses, and to improve production further.

    The Guajiayu Village Branch in Miyun County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to congratulate him and reported that in the past six months, all Party member cadres united the masses to collect firewood, dig medicinal materials, and other sideline production, earning a total income of more than 45,000 catties of grain, maintaining the lives of the people in the whole village, overcoming the disaster, and receiving the enthusiastic support of the masses. The villagers often said, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are leading correctly, otherwise people would have starved to death long ago!"
    (Cao Zong'an)
    The Songjia Village Branch in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, used the summary of half a year's experience in labor mutual aid to improve their work and welcome the Party's "July 1st" birthday. The summary pointed out that the number of mutual aid groups in the whole village increased from 84 households to 223 households, reaching more than 95% of the whole village. 195 and a half workdays were saved just in wheat harvesting, and the saved workdays were used for accumulating fertilizer and sideline production. Production in the village has returned to pre-war levels. The masses already have enough to eat and wear.
    (Mancheng County Committee)
    In order to welcome "July 1st", Lixian County, Hebei Province, selected learning models among rural branch Party members. In the branches that were selected as models, more than 90% of the Party members attended Party classes on time, and more than 60% participated in cultural learning. Twenty-six Party member learning models were selected, and they not only studied actively themselves but also often helped others to learn.
    (Lu Da, Li Fenglou)
    The Xigou Village Branch in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, formulated a work plan as a gift for the Party's "July 1st" birthday. The plan stipulated that the branch and Party members should guarantee the completion of weeding, summer harvest, and summer planting plans, and promote the use of new agricultural tools. The second is to do a good job in cultural learning, to be able to recognize, write, speak, and use. When setting the learning plan, Li Shunda said: "I am determined to eliminate my illiteracy."
