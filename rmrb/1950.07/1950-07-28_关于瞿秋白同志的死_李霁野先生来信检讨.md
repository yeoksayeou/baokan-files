Concerning the Death of Comrade Qu Qiubai

A Letter of Self-Criticism from Mr. Li Jiyie

To the Editor:

In the "People's Garden" section of the July 18th edition, Zang Kejia's article "On the Death of Comrade Qu Qiubai" stated that the poems and lyrics I quoted at the end of my article "Impressions of Mr. Qu Qiubai" in *Literary Studies*, Volume 1, Issue 6, and the phrase "Such a martyr's death is so incongruous!" With regard to Mr. Zang's opinion, I completely agree.

However, in that memorial article, my expression of respect for Mr. Qiubai should be beyond doubt. In my original manuscript, there was an "x" mark after the sentence "He composed poems and lyrics before calmly facing his execution," and the last paragraph was merely an annotation, not part of the original text, and should also have an "x" mark above it. My original intention was only to write that composing poems and lyrics demonstrates the specific fact of calmly facing execution (my opinion may be incorrect, but I thought it was equally heroic); after completing the draft, I happened to receive a reply from a friend about the circumstances of the martyrdom (omitted—Editor), so I copied the poems and lyrics at the end. Although it was an annotation and I did not emphasize the poems and lyrics themselves, I did not point out that this was not a fitting circumstance for a martyr's execution, for which I should be held responsible. Therefore, I extend my sincere apologies to Mr. Qiubai's family and to friends and readers who cherish his memory.

Mr. Zang's criticism is directed at my memorial article. If readers compare the criticism with the original text, they will probably gain more insight from Mr. Zang's article.

Li Jiyie, evening of July 18

### 关于瞿秋白同志的死  李霁野先生来信检讨

　　关于瞿秋白同志的死
    李霁野先生来信检讨编者先生：
    七月十八日《人民园地》上发表了臧克家先生《关于瞿秋白同志的死》，说我在《文艺学习》一卷六期所写的《瞿秋白先生给我的印象》末所引的诗词和《这样一个烈士的死是多不相称！》对于臧先生的这个意见，我完全同意。
    可是我在那篇纪念文中表示对于秋白先生的崇敬那是应当没有疑义的。我的原稿在“他从容就义以前还赋诗作词”一句下有个“×”号，末一段只是一个附注，并非原文，上面也应有一个“×”号。我的原意只在写赋诗作词，表明从容就义的具体事实（我的意见也许不对，不过我以为这是同样壮烈）；稿完后适好接到朋友答殉难情形的复信（从略——编者），就将诗词抄录在后面了。虽然作为附注，并未重视诗词本身，但我并没有指明这不称烈士的就义情形，是我应该负责任的。因此我对于秋白先生的家属以及爱护他的遗念的朋友和读者们致深诚的歉意。
    臧先生的批评是针对我那篇纪念文而发的，读者若拿批评和原文对读一下，从臧先生的文章可得的教益恐怕可以更多。
                        李霁野  七月十八晚
