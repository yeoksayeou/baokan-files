	Educating Communist Party Members in Vivid Work
	Editorial by Pravda

	The cause of the Lenin-Stalin Party, which inspires and organizes the Soviet people to strive for the construction of a communist society, is great and all-encompassing. The Bolshevik Party is inseparably linked with the working masses, educating and training new people in the process of building communism. Clear goals, tenacity in achieving them, and a resolute character capable of overcoming all kinds of obstacles are the prominent qualities of these people. The Bolshevik Party is concerned with cultivating its cadres and all Communist Party members in vivid practical work.

	"The true training of cadres," Comrade Stalin teaches us, "can only be obtained in vivid work, outside of schools, in the struggle with difficulties, and in overcoming difficulties. Comrades must remember that only those cadres who are not afraid of difficulties, do not evade difficulties, but, on the contrary, meet difficulties in order to overcome and eliminate them, are good cadres. Only in the struggle with difficulties can true cadres be tempered."

	Based on these brilliant instructions of Stalin, our Party has cultivated a large number of cadres armed with Bolshevism who are good at completing any task in the struggle for communism.

	The vivid combination of Communist Party members and the great cause of the Bolshevik Party is implemented in the Party's grassroots organizations, and they participate in Party work every day. Here, Communist Party members cultivate their political and professional qualities in the process of firmly grasping Bolshevism through specific assigned work for the implementation of the Party's decisions.

	The most important tool for guiding all Party members to participate in the daily work of Party organizations is the Party's assignment work. Performing Party assignments is a good school for educating and politically training Party members and probationary members. Party assignment work enables Communist Party members to develop integrity, discipline, and organization, and educates them in tenacity in achieving goals and indomitable character in overcoming difficulties.

	Our Party organizations have rich experience in guiding all Communist Party members to participate in lively and practical work. In advanced Party grassroots organizations, it is true that all Party members and probationary members are performing one or another assignment given by the Party.

	Here is one example. All Party members and probationary members in the Party organization of the 15th Workshop of the Vladimir Ilyich Factory in Moscow have been assigned Party work and are implementing it correctly. As a result of this organizational method, Communist Party members grow in vivid work and truly receive Bolshevik-style training, helping the Party organization improve its work level.

	When the Party branch of the workshop assigns work to a Party member, it does not start from a simple desire to give the Party member an assignment for the sake of giving an assignment—just to occupy him with something. No, the Party organization starts from the specific tasks placed before it and from its work plan.

	The Party organization has set a major task for itself—to ensure that all workers in the workshop produce high-quality products. Under this goal, a Party work plan was formulated, which anticipates the active participation of Communist Party members in making the workshop a producer of high-quality products. Starting from this work plan, the branch assigned specific tasks to each Communist Party member. All Party members and probationary members undertook the completion of the assigned tasks with great enthusiasm.

	The Party's coordinated and purposeful work, which was warmly supported by the workers in the workshop, brought beneficial results. The 15th Workshop of the Vladimir Ilyich Factory became a high-quality workshop. The important production tasks were completed because the Party organization was good at correctly combining political work with economic work, and was good at using this example to point out to the workers in the workshop that their daily labor is an integral part of the struggle of the entire people to strive for the early completion of the 1950 production plan and to strive for the production of high-quality products. The Party organization's mass political work served the interests of the new production upsurge.

	Party work is a vivid and creative undertaking. It cannot tolerate any rigidity, routine, or formalism. In every Party organization, work must be carried out taking into account specific characteristics and tasks. Obviously, Party work assignments must never be mechanically distributed. When the leaders of the Party organization entrust this or that task to a Communist Party member, they should have a good understanding of each Party member's level of development, work ability, and interests, and help him complete the Party's assignment every day. It is understandable that, for example, work assignments related to propaganda and agitation should be entrusted to the most mature Communist Party members.

	But it is still far from the case that all Party grassroots organizations correctly treat the issue of Party assignment work. Among the one hundred and fifty Party members and probationary members in the Party organizations of the Alma-Ata station locomotive depot and garage, one hundred people have no Party work assignments. Naturally, the Party's work in this organization is at an extremely low level. Here, even the Party committee does not perform its direct duties. In fact, there is nothing strange about this. The Kaganovich District Committee and the Alma-Ata Municipal Party Committee did not discover the serious shortcomings in the work of one of the larger grassroots organizations in the city. From this, it seems that it is no accident that in the Alma-Ata city Party organization, there are more than ninety percent of probationary members who have passed their probationary period.

	The task of improving all Party's political work and Party's organizational work in the future requires absorbing every Communist Party member to participate in active Party life.

	The primary task of Party organizations is to work with each Party member every day, help him improve his ideological and political level, enrich his Bolshevik experience in mass work, teach him to bravely and resolutely overcome the difficulties encountered in work, and educate him to be sensitive to new things. Communist Party members should feel the constant support given by the Party organization in the execution of Party work. It is not right for those Party affairs workers who do not pay daily attention to the execution of Party work. Conducting systematic inspection of the execution of every Party work is an immutable rule of Party affairs work.

	When assigning Party work, and when checking its execution, Party organizations have the responsibility to help Communist Party members see great events in small work. Every Communist Party member should remember Comrade Stalin's words: "Never refuse small work in work, because great work is composed of small work—this is one of Ilyich's important legacies." Communist Party members should be educated to perform any Party work with a high sense of responsibility.

	The most important condition for Bolsheviks to educate Communist Party members is criticism and self-criticism. Bolshevik self-criticism should educate Communist Party members to be highly strict with themselves, to be irreconcilable to shortcomings, and to strive to improve their work day by day. Work should be stipulated in such a way that every Communist Party member summarizes his work every day, critically estimates its results, and draws necessary conclusions on his own business.

	Our Party is strong because of the unity of will and action, and because of the active activities of millions of Communist Party members who lead the broad masses of working people. Every Communist Party member regards it as his duty to integrate his hopes with the Party's hopes and work with the Party. The task of the honor and dignity of Party members is to complete work. This work is a contribution to the common cause of winning communism, the common creation of the great Lenin-Stalin Party.

### 在生动的工作中教育共产党员  真理报社论

　　在生动的工作中教育共产党员
    真理报社论
    鼓舞并组织苏联人民为建设共产主义社会而斗争的列宁——斯大林党的事业是伟大的并是包罗万象的。布尔什维克党不可分地与劳动群众联结在一起，在建设共产主义过程中教育和锻炼着新的人物。目标明确，在达到目的中的顽强性，能于破除所有各种障碍的刚毅性格就是这些人物的显著品质。布尔什维克党关心地在生动实际的工作中培养自己的干部及全体共产党员。
    “干部真正的锻炼，—斯大林同志教导我们说—只有在生动的工作中，学校外面，同困难作斗争里，克服困难里来获得。同志们要记住，只有那些不怕困难，不逃避困难，而且相反，为了克服和消灭困难而去迎击困难的干部才是好干部。只有在同困难作斗争里才能磨炼成真正的干部。”
    我党依据斯大林这些英明的指示，培养了大量的，以布尔什维克主义武装起来的，善于在为共产主义斗争中完成任何任务的干部。
    在党的基层组织里实行着共产党员与布尔什维克党的伟大事业生动的结合，并每日都参加党的工作。这里在为执行党的决定的具体委任工作上，在坚强的掌握布尔什维克主义的过程中培养共产党员在政治上与业务上的质量。
    引导全体党员参加党组织的日常工作最重要的工具就是党的委派工作。执行党的委任是教育和政治上锻炼党员与候补党员的好学校。党的委任工作能使共产党员养成整体性，纪律性和组织性，教育他们在达到目标中的顽强性和在克服困难中不屈不挠的性格。
    我们党的组织具有引导全体共产党员参加活泼实际工作的丰富经验。在先进的党的基层组织里，确实是全体党员及候补党员都执行着这种或那种党给予的委任。
    这是例证中的一个。在莫斯科伏拉基米尔·伊里奇工厂第十五场中党的组织里的全体党员和候补党员都委任了党的工作并在正确的执行着。由于这样组织方法的结果，共产党员们在生动的工作中成长起来，真正受到了布尔什维克式的锻炼，帮助了党的组织提高其工作水平。
    该场党的支部对这个或那个党员委任工作时，不是由单纯的愿望出发为委任工作而给党员以委任——只是想用些什么把他占用起来。不是的，党组织是要由摆在它面前的具体任务出发，从它的工作计划出发。
    党组织在自己面前提出了一个重大的任务——达到场里所有的工人都生产出质量优良的产品。在这样的目标下，制定出了预计到共产党员们积极的参加使工场成为出产品质优良产品的党的工作计划。由这个工作计划出发，支部给每个共产党员分配了具体的工作。所有的党员和候补党员都以很大的热忱承担起了完成所付与的任务。
    被工场中工人所热烈拥护的党的协调而有目的的工作就带来了有益的结果。伏拉基米尔·伊里奇工厂第十五工场就成为了质量优良的工场。重要的生产任务之所以能完成是因为党组织善于正确的将政治工作与经济工作相结合，善于用这个范例对工场里的工人指出，他们每天的劳动是全人民为争取提前完成一九五○年生产计划而斗争，为出产优良质量的产品而斗争的一个组成部分。党组织的群众政治工作服从了新生产高潮的利益。
    党的工作是生动的，富于创造性的事业。它不能忍受任何死板，老一套，形式主义。在每一个党组织里都要照顾到具体的特点及任务来开展工作。很明显，党的工作委任绝不能机械的分配。党组织的领导者将这件或那件工作委托给一个共产党员时应当很好的了解每个党员的发展水平，工作能力和兴趣，每天的帮助他来完成党的委托。可以理解，比如说，与宣传鼓动工作相联系着的工作委任应交与那些最成熟的共产党员。
    但还相差很远，并不是在一切党的基层组织里都正确的对待关于党委任工作的这一问题。阿尔玛——阿塔站机务段和车库里的党组织在一百五十名党员和候补党员中就有一百人没有任何党的工作委任。很自然的，在这个组织里党的工作处在极端低下的水平。这里甚至党委都不去执行自己直接的职责。实际上，这件事没有任何奇怪，卡嘎诺维赤区委会和阿尔玛——阿塔党的市委会没有发现在市内较大的基层组织之一的工作中之严重缺点。这样看来，在阿尔玛——阿塔市党组织里有着为数在百分之九十以上的候补期已过的候补党员不是偶然的。
    今后提高所有党的政治工作及党的组织工作的任务要求吸收每个共产党员参加积极的党的生活。
    党组织首要的任务是每天同每一个党员在一起工作，帮助他提高思想政治水平，丰富他布尔什维克在群众工作中的经验，教给他勇敢而坚决地克服在工作中所遇到的困难，教育他对新鲜事物的感觉。共产党员在执行党的工作当中应该感到党组织给予的经常的支持。不每天注意党的工作执行情况的那些党务工作人员的作法是不对的。对党的每件工作的执行情况进行有系统的检查是党务工作中戛永恒不变的规则。
    党组织在交付党的工作时，检查其执行时，有责任帮助共产党员在细小工作中看到伟大的事件。每个共产党员应该记住斯大林同志的话：“无论任何时候也不要推辞工作中的细小工作，因为伟大的工作是由细小的而组成的，——这是伊里奇重要的遗训之一。”应当教育共产党员以高度负责精神执行党的任何工作。
    布尔什维克对共产党员教育最重要的条件是批评与自我批评。布尔什维克的自我批评应该教育共产党员高度的严格要求自己的精神，对缺点的不调和性，力求逐日地改善自己的工作。应当将工作规定为使每个共产党员每天总结自己的工作，批判地估计其成果，作出本身业务上必要的结论。
    我们的党是以意志与行动的统一，以领导着广大的劳动群众的千百万共产党员的积极活动而强大的。每个共产党员把自己的希望与党的希望融合在一起并同党一同工作看作是自己的职责。党员的荣誉而尊严的任务就是要完成工作。这工作对为共产主义获得胜利的共同事业，伟大的列宁——斯大林党的共同创造，是一个贡献。
