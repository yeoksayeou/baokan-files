　　Corruption and Illegal Activities of Village Cadres in Qianjie Village
　　Tong County Government's Letter Reporting on Handling Process
    To the Editor:
    Regarding the corruption and illegal activities of village cadres in Qianjie Village, Niubaotun, Fifth District of our county, as published in the People's Garden on May 14th, we have conducted an investigation and handled the matter. The investigation process and handling results are reported as follows:
    During the land reform in the village last year, the village cadres were selfish and seized fruits. They did not announce the distribution results to the masses, but simply gave people a slip of paper stating what items were.
    Before the autumn grain requisition in 1949, 76 jin of grain allocated by the government for military dependents were embezzled by the village chief Wang Yuheng and the security officer Lü Yong'an.
    During the autumn grain requisition last year, Lü Yong'an exchanged 596 jin of millet and 417 jin of sorghum for 1147 jin of public grain corn. During the land reform, Lü Yong'an privately cut down eight large trees in landlord Wang Fenggui's yard. During the land reform, the peasant representative assembly privately kept a mule for Shen Hongling's own use; and reserved 24 mu of land for Shen Hongling and Wang Yuheng to cultivate themselves (it has now been distributed to others).
    Shen Hongling himself had a house foundation and wood, etc., but during the land reform he also received five rooms and took a pile of bricks in the courtyard for himself, while some poor peasants did not receive housing.
    On March 27th, Wang Yuheng, Lü Yong'an, and Zhang Furong did break into Wang Fengtian's house at night with guns, which was a violation of human rights.
    In mid-March, when organizing workers to dig a river, the village dispatched carts to transport things. The cadres were unwilling to use their own livestock and instead sent Wang Youzhen's (middle peasant) livestock on duty. Wang refused. Shen Hongling then ordered the militiamen to tie Wang up, and he was released after about two hours. In February, because Wang Youzhen had a quarrel with Shen Hongling at a meeting and wanted to withdraw, he was tied up by Shen and released after the meeting. Last autumn, Wang Shenshi was also tied up by Shen Hongling for failing to pay public grain.
    Based on the above facts, the following actions have been taken against the illegal cadres:
    (1) Shen Hongling has consistently used coercion and commandism in his work, beating and scolding the masses, seriously violating the laws protecting human rights, and has repeatedly embezzled and seized fruits. He has been handed over to the People's Court for legal action.
    (2) Lü Yong'an, as the village security officer, should have protected the interests of the people, but he was selfish, corrupt, and had no position. He has been sent to the court for legal action.
    (3) Wang Yuheng, as the village chief, not only failed to correct the illegal cadres but also personally participated in criminal activities, losing prestige among the masses. He has been given a dismissal punishment.
    (4) The illegal cadres are ordered to return all the items they embezzled and redistribute them to others. The relevant cadres in this case have been criticized and educated, and ordered to admit their mistakes to the masses.

### 前街村干部贪污犯法事件  通县县府来信报告处理经过

　　前街村干部贪污犯法事件
    通县县府来信报告处理经过编者同志：
    五月十四日人民园地所载本县五区牛堡屯前街村干部贪污违法事情，我们已进行了调查处理。兹将调查经过及处理结果报告如下：
    该村去年进行土地改革时，村干部自私自利，侵占果实。他们未向群众公布分配结果，只是给人送一纸条，上写什么什么东西。
    在一九四九年秋征前，政府照顾军属的粮食七十六斤被村长王玉恒、治安员吕永安私吞了。
    去年秋征时，吕永安用口小米五百九十六斤、口高粱四百一十七斤换公粮玉米一千一百四十七斤。土改时，吕永安私砍地主王凤贵场内的大树八棵。土改时农代会私留骡子一头，由沈鸿铃自己使用；并留地二十四亩由沈鸿铃、王玉恒自种（现已分配给别人）。
    沈鸿铃自己有房屋基地及木料等，但在土地改革时又分了五间房，并将院内一堆砖占为己有，而部分贫农却未分到房子。
    三月二十七日王玉恒、吕永安、张福荣三人确在夜间持枪闯入王凤田家，这是侵犯人权的行为。
    三月中旬因组织挖河工人，村中派大车拉东西，干部不愿动自己的牲口，即派王有珍（中农）牲口出差。王不允。沈鸿铃即指使民兵将王捆起，约两小时始放。在二月里因开会王有珍曾与沈鸿铃口角，王要退席曾被沈捆起，至散会后始放。去年秋征时王沈氏不交公粮，也被沈鸿铃捆过。
    根据上述事实，对违法干部做了以下处理：
    （一）沈鸿铃工作中一贯强迫命令，打骂群众，严重地违犯保障人权法令，并多次贪污夺占果实，已交人民法院依法处理。
    （二）吕永安身为村治安员，本应保卫人民利益，但自私自利，贪污搞鬼，毫无立场，已送法院依法处理。
    （三）王玉恒身为村长，对违法干部不但不予指正，反而亲身参加犯罪行为，在群众中已丧失威信，已给撤职处分。
    （四）限令违法干部如数退出他们所贪污的东西，重行调剂给别人。并对此案有关干部进行了批评教育，令其向群众承认错误。
