　　With Production Gradually Recovering
　　Most Workers in Taiyuan are Employed
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th】 Taiyuan city has gradually solved the unemployment problem of workers during the recovery of production. Before the liberation of Taiyuan last April, about half of the city's workers were unemployed or changed their profession. After liberation, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government allocated 1.26 million jin of grain to relieve more than 31,000 unemployed workers; the Taiyuan Military Control Commission also allocated more than 3,300 public houses as workers' dormitories. With the recovery of production, most of the unemployed workers have been employed successively. By May of this year, the number of employed workers had increased to more than 64,000. The number of employed workers in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the Taiyuan Railway Bureau system has more than doubled compared with the early days of liberation; the Jinsheng Yarn Factory has also increased by about one time. At present, there are only more than 2,500 unemployed workers in the city, but the agricultural chemical plant and other factories that are being planned will soon absorb a large number of workers to participate. The unemployment problem of workers in the city has basically been solved.

　　随着生产逐步恢复
    太原工人大部就业
    【新华社太原十五日电】太原市在恢复生产中逐步解决了工人的失业问题。去年四月太原解放前，全市约有半数工人失业或转业。解放后，太原市人民政府曾拨粮一百二十六万斤，救济了三万一千余失业工人；太原市军事管制委员会并拨公房三千三百余间作为工人宿舍。随着生产的恢复，失业工人大都相继就业。到今年五月止，就业职工已增加到六万四千余人。太原钢铁厂和太原铁路局系统就业职工，已较解放初期增加了两倍以上；晋生纱厂亦增加一倍左右。目前全市尚未就业职工仅有二千五百余人，但正在筹划建设的农业化学工厂等厂，即将吸收大批职工参加。全市工人的失业问题基本上已告解决。
