　　On the Issue of Treatment for Military Dependents
    ——Reply to Comrade Li Qi

    Editor:
    I am from Yimianpo Village, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, Northeast China. I joined the Supply Department of the First Sub-district of Songjiang in 1946. In the winter of that year, the local troops were upgraded to main forces and reorganized into a division. I remained in the division's Supply Department as an accountant. My family originally received treatment as military dependents, but later the local government official in charge believed that I had married in the military and cancelled my family's treatment as military dependents. I cannot understand this. Why should my family's treatment as military dependents be cancelled because I got married in the military?
    In addition, according to the provisions of the Land Reform Law, officers and soldiers participating in the People's Liberation Army should be allocated a plot of land, but I have not been allocated one.
    I hope you can answer the above questions.

    Comrade Li Qi:
    After reading your letter, we feel that the situation is still unclear. Who in your family originally received treatment as military dependents? If it was your direct relatives, then your marriage in the revolutionary army should not change your family's treatment as military dependents. If the situation is not like this, then it is another matter.
    As for the land issue, if your family relies on agricultural production for a living and you have not been allocated land elsewhere, your hometown should allocate you the share you deserve.

　　关于军属待遇问题
    ——答李琦同志编辑同志：
    我是东北松江尚志县一面坡村人，一九四六年参加松江一分区供给部工作。当年冬季，地方部队升为主力，改编为师，我仍在师中供给部任会计工作。我家原来按军属待遇，后来地方政府负责人认为我已在部队结了婚，取消了我家的军属待遇。我对这个问题想不通。为什么因为我在部队结了婚，就取消我家的军属待遇？
    此外，按土地改革法的规定，参加人民解放军的指战员，应分给一份土地，但我没有分到。
    以上问题，希望你们能给我解答。

    李琦同志：
    你的信我们看了之后，觉得情况还不清楚。你家里原来按军属待遇的是什么人？如果是你的直系亲属，那末，你在革命部队里结了婚，并不应该改变你家的军属待遇。如果情形不是这样，又当别论。
    至于土地问题，如果你家以农业生产为生，你又未在别处分到土地，家乡是应该分给你应得的一份的。
