　　Ang'angxi Locomotive No. 1195 Safely Travels 200,000 Kilometers
    [Our Ang'angxi Dispatch] The "Iron Ox" team's key locomotive No. 1195, of the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway, safely traveled 200,000 kilometers in 548 days, from January 3rd of last year to July 3rd of this year. During this period, the group saved 700 tons of coal by implementing the three-shovel stoking method. The group also took the lead in exceeding axle load and length limits, and in launching the 500-kilometer-per-day locomotive movement. The package team is now moving towards the goal of 300,000 kilometers of safe travel.
