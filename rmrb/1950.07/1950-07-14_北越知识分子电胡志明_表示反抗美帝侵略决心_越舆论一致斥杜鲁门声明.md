　　[Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 13th] According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, on the 9th: Many intellectuals in the North Vietnamese liberated areas recently telegraphed President Ho Chi Minh, expressing their determination to oppose the US imperialist aggression against Vietnam. The telegram stated: Despite the fact that the US imperialists have intensified military "aid" to the French colonialists and their Bao Dai puppet government, the French colonialists have been repeatedly defeated in the face of the strong will of the Vietnamese people fighting for freedom for the past five years. The telegram also stated that the Vietnamese people firmly believe that under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they will overcome all difficulties and win the final victory. At the same time, the intellectuals in the area also sent letters to the intellectuals in the French-occupied areas, calling on them to expose the US imperialist conspiracy to invade Vietnam.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 8th] According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam: The Viet Minh organ newspaper, *Cuu Quoc* (National Salvation Daily), published an editorial on the 1st, denouncing US President Truman's aggressive statement issued on June 27th. The editorial, after pointing out the US imperialist conspiracy to turn Korea into its base of aggression and to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, stated that Truman's order to intensify military "aid" to the Philippines and Indochina is an attempt to suppress the growing national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, thereby securing new markets for American goods. The editorial stated: "The overbearing behavior of the US imperialists and Truman's statement are indeed the frantic and desperate struggles of a group of bandits to avoid their inescapable doom." The editorial concluded by saying that if the American warmongers have forgotten the lessons learned in China, "they will receive the same lessons again in Korea."

　　北越知识分子电胡志明
    表示反抗美帝侵略决心
    越舆论一致斥杜鲁门声明
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越九日讯：北越解放区的许多知识分子顷电胡志明主席，表示反对美帝国主义侵略越南的决心。电文略称：尽管美帝国主义者加紧以军事“援助”法国殖民主义者及其保大傀儡政府，法殖民主义者五年来却在越南人民为自由而战的坚强意志面前，一次又一次地遭到了失败。该电并称，越南人民深信，在胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府英明的领导下，定将克服一切困难，赢得最后的胜利。同时，该区知识分子们并寄信给法占区知识分子们，号召他们揭露美帝国主义侵略越南的阴谋。
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越盟机关报《救国日报》于一日发表社论，斥责美国总统杜鲁门于六月二十七日所发表的侵略声明。社论在指出美帝国主义欲使朝鲜变为其侵略基地，并欲阻止中国人民解放台湾的阴谋后称，杜鲁门之下令加紧对菲律宾、印度支那进行军事“援助”，是企图镇压目前东南亚日益增涨的民族解放运动，从而为美国货物取得新市场。社论称：“美帝国主义者的蛮横行为和杜鲁门的声明，实在是一群匪徒为了使他们自己避免无法逃避的灭亡而进行的疯狂与绝望的挣扎。”社论末称，如果美国战争贩子们已经忘记了在中国所得的教训，“他们将在朝鲜再度得到同样的教训”。
