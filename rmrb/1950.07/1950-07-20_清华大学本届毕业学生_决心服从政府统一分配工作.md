　　Tsinghua University's Graduating Students
    Resolve to Obey the Government's Unified Job Assignment
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] This year's graduating students of Tsinghua University are determined to obey the government's unified job assignment. They wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting on their progress in studies, ideological transformation, and health since liberation, and guaranteeing that in the future, they will humbly learn and diligently study in their work posts, and excellently complete the tasks assigned to them by the country.
    The four colleges of Arts, Law, Science, and Engineering, with twenty departments in total, have 408 graduating students. In early May, when this year's graduating students were filling out the graduate student work preference form issued by the Ministry of Education, more than 70 percent filled in "resolutely obey the assignment of the Ministry of Education." Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, after writing down their specialties, specifically expressed their willingness to submit to the interests of the people and the needs of the country, requesting the government not to overconsider their preferences. A few students originally had personal plans regarding work location, nature, and treatment, but after everyone's mutual help and their own repeated consideration, they now also express their obedience to the government's assignment and are determined to serve the people.
    Currently, the graduating students of the school are seizing the time to carry out daily recreational and sports activities, and studying Gao Gang's report, "To Whom Does Honor Belong?"; and in conjunction with the business of each class, formulating plans to separately study "Standing at the Forefront of Northeast Economic Construction," "The People Building Stalingrad," and documents related to trade unions and enterprise management, in order to improve their policy level and professional knowledge.

　　清华大学本届毕业学生
    决心服从政府统一分配工作
    【新华社十八日讯】清华大学本届毕业学生决心服从政府统一分配工作。他们写信给毛主席，报告解放以来他们在学习上、思想改造上、健康上的进步，保证今后在工作岗位上，虚心学习，努力钻研，很好地完成国家交给他们的任务。
    该校文、法、理、工四院二十个系共有毕业学生四百零八人。五月上旬，本届毕业学生在填写教育部发下的毕业学生工作志愿表时，填写“坚决服从教育部分配”的占百分之七十以上。共产党员和青年团员写上自己的特长后，特别表示愿意服从于人民利益和国家需要，请求政府不要过多考虑他们的志愿。少数学生原来对于工作地点、性质、待遇等问题有个人打算，经过大家相互的帮助和自己的再三考虑，现在也表示服从政府分配，决心为人民服务。
    目前该校毕业学生正抓紧时间进行日常的文娱、体育活动，学习高岗的报告《荣誉是属于谁的》；并结合各班本身的业务，订出计划，分别学习《站在东北经济建设的最前面》、《建设斯大林格勒的人们》以及有关工会和企业管理等文件，以提高政策水平和业务知识。
