　　Wang Fuzhi's Violation of Laws and Discipline Should Be Handled by Judicial Organs
　　To the Editor:
    The People's Garden on June 16th published "Wang Fuzhi, Deputy Company Commander of a Certain Unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Subdistrict, Beat Women and Forced a Divorce," and stated that the Shijiazhuang Military Subdistrict Party Committee had already given Wang Fuzhi a public warning within the Party.
    I think this handling is too lenient. Wang Fuzhi, as a cadre of the People's Liberation Army and a Communist Party member, actually interfered in the marriage issues of the masses, asking Zang Ni's father, Fan Zhicai, to "enforce family law," and tore up her marriage certificate after searching her pockets. Due to his encouragement, Fan Zhicai and his son beat Zang Ni until she "lost consciousness." This behavior is a manifestation of the remnants of warlordism and violates the laws of the Party and the People's Government. I suggest that Wang Fuzhi be handed over to the judicial organs for handling.

　　王福芝违反法纪事件应交司法机关处理
    革命军人铁枫来信建议编辑同志：
    六月十六日人民园地登载了“石家庄军分区某部副连长王福芝吊打妇女，强迫离婚”。并说石家庄军分区党委会已经给王福芝以党内当众警告处分。
    我以为这种处理，未免过轻。王福芝身为人民解放军的干部，又是一个共产党员，竟干涉群众的婚姻问题，要赃妮的父亲范志彩“动家法”，并从她衣袋里搜出结婚证扯掉了。范志彩父子由于他的鼓励，把赃妮打得“昏迷”过去。这种行为是军阀主义残余的表现，违反了党和人民政府的法令。我建议把王福芝交司法机关处理。
