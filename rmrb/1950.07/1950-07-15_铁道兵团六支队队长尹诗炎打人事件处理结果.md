		Letter from the Political Department of the Railway Engineering Corps
To the Editor Comrades: Regarding the incident of Comrade Yin Shiyan hitting someone, we did not handle it promptly after it occurred, which shows that we have not paid enough attention to the understanding and education of cadres in our leadership. Now, the Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps has decided to give Comrade Yin Shiyan a public warning as a disciplinary measure to educate all comrades and himself.

	Yin Shiyan's Self-Criticism on the Incident of Beating Bai Haizhou
At 8:00 PM on May 21st, I instructed Yang Xiangdong, the chief of the material section of my department, to have the material car delivered to the repair site at 4:00 AM on the 22nd. At 4:00 AM on the 22nd, I asked the switchman, "Has the material car been sent?" He replied, "It has been sent." At 6:00 AM, I asked Comrade Yang Xiangdong again. Comrade Yang told me that the material car had not been sent yet. I was afraid of delaying the work on-site, so I went to the stationmaster, Comrade Bai Haizhou, and asked him why the material car had not been sent yet. He had nothing to say in response. I was very angry at the time and lost my temper and hit him. Regarding the situation at that time, I would like to explain: there are only four railway tracks in Daiyue Station, one is a dead-end track, one is being repaired, and there are two tracks that can be used for shunting. The number of material cars attached that day was not large, only twelve in total, and there were seven or eight hundred workers working on-site every day. As long as someone took some responsibility, it could have been sent out on schedule. If the material car was not sent out on time, it would greatly affect the project. Because the Railway Bureau instructed us to repair the railway to Shuoxian by the end of May. But no matter what, my behavior of hitting and detaining people was completely wrong. The reason for this mistake is that I usually do not like to study, and my ideological progress is very slow. I forgot that I am a Communist Party member and that I am a responsible cadre. Therefore, it exposed the remnants of warlordism, violated human rights, and insulted worker brothers. This is a serious mistake. I fully accept the punishment given to me by the Party Committee of the Engineering Corps. In addition to publicly admitting my mistake and apologizing to Comrade Bai, I must strengthen my studies, improve myself, and correct my mistakes in the future.

　　铁道兵团六支队队长尹诗炎打人事件处理结果
    编者按：大同车务段王承君等同志来信所反映的尹诗炎打人扣人的事件，经我们转请铁道兵团政治部调查处理，现将铁道兵团政治部的答复及尹诗炎对此事件的检讨一并发表如下：
            铁道兵团政治部来信
    编辑同志：关于尹诗炎同志打人事件，在事情发生后，我们没有及时进行处理，这说明我们在领导上对干部的掌握与教育是不够重视的。现铁道兵团党委已决定给尹诗炎同志当众警告的处分，以教育全体同志及其本人。

        尹诗炎对殴打白海洲事件的自我检讨
    五月二十一日午后八时，我指示我部材料处股长杨向东同志，要将材料车于二十二日晨四时开到修道现场。到了二十二日晨四时，我去问调车员：“材料车发出了吗？”他回答：“发出了。”六时我又去问杨向东同志。杨同志告诉我材料车尚未发出。我因恐耽误现场工作，即又去找站长白海洲同志，问他为何材料车还未发出？他无话答我。我当时非常生气，一时火起，便动手打了他。关于当时的情况，我要说明一下：岱岳站只有四股铁道，一股是死道，一股正在修理，还有两股道可以调车。那天所挂的材料车并不多，一共才十二辆，在现场工作的职工每日有七、八百人，只要是负些责任是可以按照规定时间发出的。如果材料车不按时发出，影响工程甚巨。因为路局指示我们一定要于五月底将铁道修至朔县。但是无论怎样，我打人扣人的行为是完全错误的。发生这次错误的原因，是因我平日不爱学习，思想上进步很慢，忘记了自己是一个共产党员，忘记了自己是个负责干部。因此暴露了军阀思想的残余，侵犯人权，侮辱工人兄弟。这是一个严重的错误。兵团党委给我的处分我完全接受。除当众承认错误，并向白同志赔礼道歉外，我今后一定要加强学习，提高自己，改正错误。
