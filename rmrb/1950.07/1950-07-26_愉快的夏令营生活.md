　　Happy Summer Camp Life
　　Peking University Institute of Technology Correspondence Group
　　We, more than 600 students from eleven schools including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, the Institute of Technology of North China University, Peimanzhong Girls' School, Huiwen Middle School, Yuying Middle School, and Muzhen Girls' School, set off on the morning of the 15th and arrived in Qinhuangdao that evening. The Kailuan Mining Bureau warmly received us and sent us to the seaside campsite by small train.
　　The summer camp is stationed on the seashore, backed by small mountains and facing the sea. The mountains are lush with trees, and the dense shade covers the green stone road; it is refreshing and pleasant, with excellent scenery.
　　In the days before we arrived, the garrison soldiers braved the rain to build sheds for us, build stoves, and transferred sixty excellent cooks to ensure that we ate well. On the evening of our arrival, the soldiers cleaned our dormitories, laid reeds, and prepared a rich dinner for us. We should have extended our regards to these heroic soldiers, but they had already given us more than a hundred letters of sympathy and sent a large pig. Receiving such unearned merit, we truly felt ashamed and uneasy about the soldiers' warm hospitality, and at the same time, it increased our respect and love for them.
　　On the 16th, we visited the Kailuan Wharf. The workers cleaned the more than one-mile-long wharf very cleanly. At that time, three seagoing vessels were weighing anchor and setting sail. We visited a large seagoing vessel, and the engineering students entered the engine room for a visit.
　　The opening ceremony was held on the morning of the 17th. The leaders of the garrison, the political commissar, and the mayor of Qinhuangdao all came to participate and gave us a lot of encouragement and instructions. The soldiers proposed to learn culture from us, and we proposed to learn their organizational discipline, diligent and heroic spirit, and military common sense. The soldiers and students were integrated together. That evening, all circles in Qinhuangdao held a reception in the People's Theater to welcome us. The soldiers performed wonderful recreational programs for us.
　　Every morning we have group activities, or visit the military exercises of the garrison, and listen to combat heroes tell combat stories. Each of us received two bullets for live ammunition shooting exercises. The afternoon is everyone's most interesting time for swimming at the seaside. Everyone's skin has been tanned, healthy and beautiful!
　　Living in the seaside summer camp not only exercised our bodies, but also made us understand the essence of the people's army more deeply. Many students have proposed to guarantee that they will always learn from them.

　　愉快的夏令营生活
    北大工学院通讯组
    我们北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学、师范大学、辅仁大学、华北大学工学院、贝满女中、汇文中学、育英中学、慕贞女中等十一校共六百余同学，在十五日上午出发，当晚就到达了秦皇岛。开滦矿务局热烈地招待了我们，用小火车送我们到达海滨宿营地。
    夏令营扎驻在海滨，背倚小山、面临大海，山上树木繁茂，浓荫遮覆沥青山道；清爽宜人，风景绝佳。
    在我们来到这里的前几天，驻军战士们，冒雨为我们搭好席棚，筑成炉灶，并调了六十位优良的炊事员，保证让我们吃好饭食。我们来到的当晚，战士们为我们打扫了寝室，铺好芦苇，并且给我们预备了一顿丰富的晚餐。对这些英勇的战士们，我们正应该致以慰问，但他们却已先给了我们一百多封慰问信，并且送来了一口大猪。无功受禄，对战士们的这种热情招待，真使我们感到惭愧和不安，同时也更增加了对他们的敬爱。
    十六日我们参观了开滦码头。工友们为我们把一里多长的码头打扫得很干净。当时正有三只海轮拔锚开航，我们参观了一只很大的海轮，学工科的同学并进入机器房参观。
    开营典礼是在十七日上午举行的，驻军首长、政委、秦皇岛市长都来参加了，给了我们很多的勉励和指示。战士们提出向我们学习文化，我们提出向他们学习组织性纪律性、勤奋英勇的精神、军事常识，战士们和同学们融汇在一起。这天晚上，秦市各界在人民戏院开招待会欢迎我们。战士们为我们演出了精彩的游艺节目。
    每天上午我们有集体活动，或参观驻军的军事演习，听战斗英雄讲述战斗故事，我们每人分得了二粒子弹，作为实弹射击演习之用。下午是大家最感兴趣的海滨游泳。大家的皮肤都已晒黑了，健康而美丽！
    生活在海滨夏令营中，不但锻炼了身体，而且使我们更深一步地了解了人民军队的本质。很多同学都提出保证，永远向他们学习。
