Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Even after the arrival of the US Army in Korea, it has been unable to stop the victorious advance of the Korean People's Army and the rout of Syngman Rhee's army. According to a report from the Associated Press: Syngman Rhee's army "completely abandoned the Han River defense line" on the afternoon of the 3rd. The "retreat of Syngman Rhee's army has almost turned into a rout. Soldiers evacuating the front lines are traveling by trucks, jeeps, and on foot, in groups and alone." Syngman Rhee's army's headquarters in Suwon was "hastily evacuated from Suwon" on the afternoon of the 4th. According to a report from Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd: After fleeing from Seoul to Suwon, and from Suwon to Daejeon, the Syngman Rhee puppet government, without catching its breath, has already fled from Daejeon to Jeonju, sixty kilometers south of Daejeon. The puppet president Syngman Rhee has fled alone to Busan, which is close to Japan.

The US military is now deployed in Pyeongtaek, twenty miles south of Suwon. Syngman Rhee's army, which retreated from Suwon, was ordered by the US to delay its continued retreat and to deploy in front of the US military. In this way, the US military is using Syngman Rhee's army as its shield.

　　李承晚军继续溃逃  傀儡政府由大田南逃全州
    【新华社五日讯】美国陆军抵达朝鲜后，依然不能阻止朝鲜人民军的胜利推进和李承晚军的溃败。据合众社讯：李承晚军队已在三日下午“完全放弃汉江防线”。李承晚军队的“退却几乎已变为溃败。撤离前线的士兵有乘卡车的，乘吉普的，步行的，结队的与单独的”。李承晚军队在水原的司令部，已于四日下午“由水原慌忙撤退”。又据法新社东京三日讯：李承晚傀儡政府继由汉城逃至水原、由水原再逃至大田后，喘息未定，又已由大田逃往大田以南六十公里的全州。而傀儡总统李承晚则已只身逃至紧邻日本的釜山。
    美军现在水原以南二十英里的平泽布防，由水原溃退的李承晚军被美方命令延缓继续后退，并在美军前方布防。这样，美军就利用了李承晚军作为自己的挡箭牌。
