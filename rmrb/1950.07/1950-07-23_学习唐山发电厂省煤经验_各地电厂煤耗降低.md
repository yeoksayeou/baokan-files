　　Learning from the Coal Saving Experience of Tangshan Power Plant
    Coal Consumption Reduced in Power Plants Across the Country
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the National Electricity Industry Conference held in February this year, responsible cadres from local electricity bureaus or power plants have visited the Tangshan Power Plant one after another to learn from the plant's experience in reducing coal consumption. Qingdao Power Plant, by applying Tangshan Electric's coal-saving experience, has reduced its coal consumption to 0.6723 kilograms in the coal and electricity saving competition with Qishuyan Power Plant, a decrease of 9.149 percent compared to the ministry-set standard. Under the influence of Tangshan Power Plant, Qinhuangdao Power Plant, relying on its workers, has continuously improved its technology, and its coal consumption has dropped sharply from over 2 kilograms to 1.65 kilograms. The coal consumption of Jiamusi Power Plant has also decreased from 0.85 kilograms to 0.72 kilograms. The power department of Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory, at the beginning of implementing Tangshan Power Plant's coal-saving experience, has reduced its daily coal consumption from 85 tons to 80 tons, and its coal consumption has dropped to 0.76 kilograms, breaking the department's historical record.
