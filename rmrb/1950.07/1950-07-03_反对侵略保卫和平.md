　　Oppose Aggression and Defend Peace
    Zhou Jianren
    Since World War II, the peace camp, led by the Soviet Union, has been growing rapidly. At the same time, the aggressive camp, led by American imperialism, felt its decline. But it is not reconciled to extinction, and still wants to plunder the achievements of natural science that should be used for peaceful construction and for creating happiness for mankind with the utilization of atomic energy, and apply them criminally to the manufacture of atomic weapons of destruction. This sinful act is resented by peace-loving people all over the world. As soon as the World Peace Congress issued the call for signatures to defend peace, for example, in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the signatories accounted for about 80 percent of the total population. This is enough to show the consistency of the world's people's love of peace and opposition to the aggressive intentions of imperialism. If everyone continues to work hard to defend peace, the imperialists will inevitably have to abandon their sinful aggressive intentions. The use of American atomic energy will eventually be transferred to the hands of the people, and its use will be changed.

　　反对侵略保卫和平
    周建人
    第二次世界大战以后，眼见得以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量日益迅速地壮大起来。同时美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营感觉到自己的日趋于没落。但它不甘心灭亡，还想掠夺应当用于和平建设，为人类创造幸福的利用原子能的自然科学的成果，罪恶地应用于制造毁灭人类的原子武器。此种罪恶行为，为全世界爱好和平的人民所同忿。世界拥护和平大会的保卫和平的签名号召一经发出，例如东欧新民主主义国家签名者便都占全人口百分之八十左右。这一点，就足以表明世界人民的爱好和平与反对帝国主义的侵略企图的一致。大家继续为保卫和平而努力，帝国主义者必然不得不放弃罪恶的侵略企图。美国原子能的利用，终将转移到人民手里，而改变它的用途。
