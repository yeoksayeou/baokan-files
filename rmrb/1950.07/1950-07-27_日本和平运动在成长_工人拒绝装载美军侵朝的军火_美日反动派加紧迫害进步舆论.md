　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 25th via TASS: The movement to defend peace within Japan is growing daily despite brutal police persecution. Japanese progressive forces are actively campaigning to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. Japanese workers are refusing to load American military supplies destined for the American invading forces in Korea.
　　The *New Culture News* reports that women and youth are participating in the signature collection campaign for the Stockholm Appeal. The newspaper particularly pointed out that the Tokushima Women's Democratic Club (note: in eastern Shikoku) collected signatures from over a thousand people for the declaration in just one day. As of July 10th, the Shimonoseki branch of the Japan Democratic Youth League had collected 3,200 signatures.
　　The *Mainichi Shimbun* stated that peace defenders in Shizuoka posted a large number of anti-war leaflets and slogans to protest the American invasion of Korea. Workers in Kanagawa Prefecture once again refused to load American military supplies designated for aggression against the Korean people. It is reported that three workers have already "disappeared." In Yahata, police arrested six workers for distributing anti-war leaflets.
　　Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Under MacArthur's direction, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is intensifying its efforts to deprive the Japanese people of freedom of speech, attempting to completely stifle the voice of the Japanese people. According to Kyodo News Agency reports, officials from the Special Examination Bureau of the Ministry of Justice and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department searched the distribution offices of the *Labor News*, published by the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council, and the *New Culture News*, published by the Japan Democratic Culture League, on the night of the 24th. Citing MacArthur's illegal order of the 18th to indefinitely close the *Red Flag* newspaper and other progressive publications, they ordered the two newspapers to cease publication. Prior to this, the Kinki branch of the Special Examination Bureau (note: including Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Hyogo, Mie, Shiga, and Wakayama prefectures) ordered 107 Japanese Communist Party publications distributed in the area to permanently cease publication on the 23rd. According to incomplete statistics, since the 17th, the Special Examination Bureau has illegally closed at least 650 newspapers and periodicals published by local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party.

    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社二十五日电引东京消息：日本境内保卫和平运动，不顾残酷的警察迫害，日益成长。日本进步势力为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名而进行着积极的运动。日本工人拒绝装载运给朝鲜境内美国侵略军队的美国军用物资。
    《新文化报》报道，妇女和青年都参加为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动。该报特别指出：德岛（按在四国东部）妇女民主俱乐部仅在一天之内就已为该宣言征集到一千多人的签名。到七月十日为止，日本民主青年联盟下关分会，已征集到三千二百人的签名。

    【新华社二十六日讯】在麦克阿瑟的指使下，日本吉田反动政府正变本加厉地剥夺日本人民的言论自由，力图完全窒息日本人民的声音。综合共同社消息：法务府特别审查局及东京警察局负责官员，于二十四日夜搜查全日工会联络协议会出版的劳动新闻及日本民主主义文化联盟出版的新文化报两报的发行所，并根据十八日麦克阿瑟无限期封闭赤旗报及其他进步报刊的非法指令，命令该两报停止发行。在此以前，特别审查局近畿（按：包括大阪、京都、奈良、兵库、三重、滋贺及和歌山七县）支部，于二十三日勒令在该区发行的日本共产党报刊一百零七家永久停刊。据不完全的统计，自十七日以来，为特别审查局非法封闭的日共地方组织出版的报刊，至少在六百五十家以上。
