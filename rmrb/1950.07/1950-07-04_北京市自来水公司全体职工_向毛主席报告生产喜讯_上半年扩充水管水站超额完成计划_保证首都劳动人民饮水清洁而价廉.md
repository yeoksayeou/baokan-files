　　To the respected Chairman Mao:
　　Under your loving care and wise leadership, and due to the increased political awareness of all employees, everyone is bravely engaged in production battles at their posts. You must be willing to know about our production situation. Now we report the good news of our production in the past six months to you.
　　In order to enable the working people of the capital to have clean and affordable tap water, we planned to expand 52,140 meters of main and branch pipes in 1950. We have now completed 30,623.59 meters, exceeding the half-year target by 20 percent. We have also added 206 public water stations and renovated 170 private wells. The original plan was to complete this by the end of August, but in order to welcome the birthday of our own Party, we have strived to complete the original plan by the end of June.
　　In these six months, the population using tap water, the original annual plan was to increase by 300,000 to 400,000 people, and now we have basically completed the annual planned target.
　　In terms of fees: in the past, the monthly collection rate was only about 70 percent, last year it increased to 90 percent, and this year the plan is to collect 93 percent. Now we have reached 99.92 percent, exceeding the original plan.
　　In terms of water quality: in the past, the entire company only had one disinfection machine, and it was not often disinfected. Last year, we added one, and this year we installed two more. We guarantee that the working people will have clean water.
　　On June 21, we enthusiastically held a production award ceremony and awarded 40 model producers. Some of them created tools, some saved materials, and some improved technology. We feel it is worth reporting to you again that we have successfully imitated leak detectors. These are used to check whether there are leaks in underground water pipes. In the past, we bought them from the United States. Now, the ones we have imitated are almost as good as the American products and can be used. This award has greatly improved the production enthusiasm of employees. Everyone feels that before liberation, working hard to death was no one's business. Now that we have achieved results, the leadership not only praises us but also gives us rewards. This is all because of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.
　　We firmly guarantee to you: under your wise leadership, we will definitely do a good job in the capital's water supply, implement the democratization of enterprise management, and carry out rationalization proposals to create new records, and strive for the working people of the whole capital to have clean and affordable tap water. And wish you good health.
　　Respectfully,
　　All employees of the Beijing Water Company
　　June 29

　　北京市自来水公司全体职工
    向毛主席报告生产喜讯
    上半年扩充水管水站超额完成计划
    保证首都劳动人民饮水清洁而价廉
    【京市新闻处讯】京市自来水公司全体职工在“七一”前夕上书毛主席，报告该公司今年上半年超额完成生产计划的情况，并保证为全首都劳动人民吃到清洁价廉的自来水而奋斗。全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的爱护和英明的领导下，由于全体职工政治觉悟的提高，在生产岗位上个个都奋勇地展开了生产战斗，您一定愿意知道我们的生产情形吧，现在我们把这半年来的生产喜讯报告给您。
    为了使首都劳动人民吃到清洁而价廉的自来水，在一九五○年我们计划扩充干支管五二、一四○公尺，现已完成三○、六二三．五九公尺，超过半年任务百分之二十；并且增设公共水站二○六处，改装私营水井一七○处，原计划于八月底以前完成，我们为了迎接自己党的生日，已争取在六月底完成了原订计划。
    在这六个月用自来水的人口，全年原订计划增加三十至四十万人，现在基本上已经完成了全年预订计划。
    收费方面：过去每月收费率只到百分之七十左右，去年提高到百分之九十，今年计划收费率到百分之九十三，现在已经做到百分之九十九点九二，超过了原订计划。
    水质方面：在过去全公司只有一具消毒机，并且还不经常消毒，在去年增加了一具，今年又按装了两具，我们保证使劳动人民吃到清洁的水。
    在六月二十一日，我们热烈地开了一次生产奖励大会，奖励了四十位模范的生产者。他们有的创造了工具，有的节约了材料，有的提高了技术。我们觉着值得再向您报告的，就是我们仿制听漏器的成功，这是检查埋在地下的水管有无漏水情形用的，从前向美国购买，现在我们仿造出来的与美货相差无几，足可应用。这次奖励更大大地提高了职工生产情绪，每人感觉到解放前干活累死了也没有人管，现在干出了成绩，领导上不但表扬还给奖励，这都是因为有了毛主席和共产党。
    我们坚决向您保证：在您英明的领导下，一定能把首都自来水事业搞好，贯彻执行企业管理民主化，并开展合理化建议，创造新纪录运动，为全首都劳动人民吃到清洁而价廉的自来水而奋斗。      并且祝您健康
    北京市自来水公司全体职工敬礼
    六月二十九日
