　　New Hunan Folk Song
　　Recorded by Wu Benxing
　　A letter from the Hunan countryside: After liberation, the movements to reduce rent, reduce interest, return deposits, and oppose local tyrants were launched. The RMB went to the countryside, and the peasants' enthusiasm for labor increased, and their lives were stabilized and gradually improved. The letter included a folk song written and sung by the peasants themselves, which I am now transcribing below for the readers. A few typos have been corrected.

　　Thinking of Mao Zedong in my heart, the sun is red at midnight.
　　With Mao Zedong in my eyes, the dark mountain road is clear.
　　Speaking of Mao Zedong, I forget my fatigue and keep working.
　　Talking about Mao Zedong on the road, even a thousand-pound load feels light.
　　Mentioning Mao Zedong while eating, the cabbage and radish taste delicious.
　　Cheering for Mao Zedong at meetings, rent reduction and interest reduction bring joy.
　　Local tyrants hear about Mao Zedong, and thunder strikes in clear skies, deafening.
　　Spies hear about Mao Zedong, and tuck their tails and flee without a trace.
　　Hanging Mao Zedong's picture on the wall is like a red lantern shining brightly.
　　Everyone learns from Mao Zedong, and everyone labors to be a hero.

　　新湖南山歌
    吴奔星录
    湖南乡间来信：解放后展开减租、减息、退押、反霸运动，人民币下乡，农民劳动热情高涨，生活由稳定而逐渐提高。信中附有农民自己编唱的山歌一首，现在我转录在下面，介绍给读者。其中稍有几个错别字，已经改正。
    心中想着毛泽东，三更半夜太阳红。
    眼中有了毛泽东，漆黑山路路路通。
    口中说起毛泽东，忘了疲劳不停工。
    路上谈起毛泽东，千斤担子也轻松。
    吃饭提到毛泽东，白菜萝卜味儿浓。
    开会欢呼毛泽东，减租减息乐融融。
    恶霸听说毛泽东，晴天打雷震耳聋。
    特务听说毛泽东，狗夹尾巴逃无踪。
    墙上挂着毛泽东，好比当中点红灯。
    人人学习毛泽东，人人劳动争英雄。
