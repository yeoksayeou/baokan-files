The following is the full text of the letter.
　　Editor:
Chairman Mao:
　　Thank you for your concern for our production, for sending people to see our mutual aid production situation, guide us to improve production technology, and help us to formulate production plans. We are very happy and will work harder to improve the exchange of labor and mutual aid.
　　We have a total of twenty-two households with one hundred and thirteen people. There are a total of thirty-nine full and semi-laborers, both male and female, who have all been organized to carry out exchange labor and mutual aid. We have elected our own group leader to lead production, and we have made considerable achievements. Our group's forty-five mu of paddy fields were all planted with seedlings in three days, and at the same time, the seedling planting difficulties of two military families were resolved. We have the confidence and determination to organize the exchange of labor and mutual aid even better, and guarantee to you the realization of the autumn production increase plan.
　　This year, our group's paddy fields have all been plowed three times before planting seedlings. Fertilizer was applied once (some of which were applied twice). In the future, we guarantee to plow three to four times each season and apply fertilizer once to twice each year. Not a single weed is left. The ninety-two mu of wheat seedlings planted this year were all fertilized once. There are also one hundred and twenty-four mu of dry land planted with soybeans, weeded three times. We will achieve intensive cultivation and careful work, process and apply fertilizer, and ensure a greater harvest of grain.
　　The group currently has seven Western-style windmills (waterwheels), nine treadmills, four cattle, and seven boats. We have discussed and decided to buy two more cattle, purchase two Western-style windmills, and nail together two boats from this autumn to next autumn.
　　We have decided to consolidate and develop our work on the basis of the existing exchange of labor and mutual aid, guarantee to persist in it, and promote the five mutual aid groups in the whole village to jointly improve production mutual aid. In the future, we plan to regularly report the production situation to you. With best regards.
　　All farmers of the Chen Lianzhang Group, Baijia Village, Tongnan District, Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu

　　盐城柏家村陈连章互助组
    上书毛主席保证秋季增产
    中央人民政府农业部春耕生产检查团，在苏北盐城县同南区柏家村帮助勤劳农户拟订兴家计划后，该村陈连章互助组，于六月七日上书毛主席，保证实现秋季增产计划。下面是原信的全文。               
    编者毛主席：
    感谢您关心我们的生产，派人来看看我们生产互助情形，指导我们改进生产技术，帮助我们订生产计划。我们万分高兴，一定要更加努力，搞好换工互助。
    我们一共二十二户，一百十三人。男女整劳动力和半劳动力共三十九个，已经全部组织起来，进行换工互助。我们自己选出了组长，领导生产，并且做出了不少的成绩。全组四十五亩水田，三天即全部栽好秧，同时又解决了两户军属的栽秧困难。我们有信心有决心把换工互助组织得更好，向您保证实现秋季增产计划。
    我们全组的水田，今年都是耕三遍下秧的。施了一次肥（其中有一部分施两次）。以后保证每季耕三遍到四遍，每年施肥一次到二次。草薅得一棵都没有了。今年栽的九十二亩麦田秧，全部施肥一遍。还有一百二十四亩旱田种黄豆，薅三遍草。做到精耕细作，加工施肥，保证多收粮食。
    组内现有洋风车（水车）七部，踏车九部，牛四条，船七只。我们讨论好了，从今秋到明秋再买两条牛，置两部洋车，钉两只船。
    我们决定在现有的换工互助基础上进行巩固与发展工作，保证坚持下去，并推动全村的五个互助组，共同搞好生产互助。以后我们打算经常把生产情形向您报告。此致敬礼
    苏北盐城同南区柏家村陈连章小组全体农民
    六月七日
