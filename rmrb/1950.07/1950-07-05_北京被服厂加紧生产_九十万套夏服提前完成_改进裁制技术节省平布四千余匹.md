　　Beijing Uniform Factory Speeds Up Production
    900,000 Summer Uniforms Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Improved Cutting Techniques Save Over 4,000 Bolts of Plain Cloth
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Uniform Factory completed its task of producing 940,000 summer uniforms ahead of schedule, saving over 4,000 bolts of plain cloth. This production task began on December 2nd of last year. Because the style was new, workers were not very skilled, and many difficulties were encountered during production. At the beginning, the First Branch Factory averaged 1.773 sets per person per day, and most of them did not meet the standards. Later, under the leadership of the trade union, a technical research group was established, and most of the workers did not rest at noon, but studied and improved their techniques. For the uniform factory, such a large production task was unprecedented. The cutting department also initially failed to meet the standard number. According to the estimate at the time, it would be necessary to add two shifts (seven people per shift) to complete the task on schedule. After everyone studied it, they decided to add four electric knives to cut 120 layers at a time (originally 100 layers). At the same time, production competitions were launched between factories, between shifts, and between groups, so that the output increased from 5.641 sets per person per day in January to 7.296 sets in the end. The quality also improved accordingly: initially 75 percent met the standards, then 91 percent in the middle, and finally 97 percent. In this production, two model factories, six model shifts, eleven model groups, and seventy-four individual models were selected; thanks to their efforts, the entire production task was completed two days ahead of schedule on May 4th.

　　北京被服厂加紧生产
    九十万套夏服提前完成
    改进裁制技术节省平布四千余匹
    【本报讯】北京被服厂九十四万套夏服任务提前完成，并节省平布四千余匹。此项生产任务系自去年十二月二日开始。因为样式是新式的，工人还不很熟练，生产中曾遇到不少困难。第一分厂开始时，每人平均日产一点七七三套，且大部不合标准。后在工会领导下成立了技术研究组，大部分工友中午都不休息，钻研改进技术；在被服厂来说，这样大的生产任务还是空前的。裁剪部起初也是达不到标准数，据当时估计需要增加两个班（每班七人）才能如期完成任务。后经大家研究，决定增加四把电刀，一次裁一百二十层（原裁一百层）。同时并展开了厂与厂、班与班、组与组的生产竞赛，使得产量由一月份每人日产五点六四一套，最后提高到七点二九六套。质量也随之提高：初期百分之七十五合标准，中期百分之九十一，最后到百分之九十七。在这次生产中选出了两个模范厂，六个模范班，十一个模范组，七十四名个人模范；由于他们的努力使得全部生产任务于五月四日提前两天完成。（马德兴）
