	All the workers and staff of the Beijing Public Transportation Company unanimously stated at the election of employee representative conference on July 19 that they would definitely support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and supporting their Korean class brothers. The workers and staff all said: "Our working class has stood up completely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We have enough wisdom and strength to build our country. We can drive the warmongers out of mainland China, and we can drive the warmongers out of Taiwan. We are determined to implement democratic management in our production work, reduce costs and increase income, improve quality and strengthen maintenance, and achieve a balance of payments in practical actions to oppose the aggressive behavior of American imperialism and its running dogs." (Beijing Public Transportation Company)

	The tram company union put slogans on the trams on the 19th, and some workers automatically launched propaganda. He Kangzhong, the driver of the "World Federation of Trade Unions" tram, said: "I will try my best to publicize on the tram so that everyone understands the conspiracy of American imperialism." Zou Deli, a model driver who won the award from January to April, said: "We are workers, and we firmly support the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions. We must use production and conservation to support the Korean people's war of liberation. I must maintain the achievements from January to April and respond to the aggression of American imperialism with the practical actions of saving cars and saving electricity."

	The Beijing Machine General Factory Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association convened a anti-aggression meeting for all members and employees of the factory after work on the afternoon of the 20th. Before the meeting, worker Gao Yanchang and others performed a segment of the "Shu Lai Bao" (a type of folk ballad) for peace signing, recounting the mad acts of aggression by American imperialism. Machine worker Shi Ruan was so moved that he said: "We must step up production to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan!" Then, Factory Director Hu, the chairman of the Friendship Association branch, made a report. He pointed out: "The Korean people have the right to demand independence and unification. The victory of the Korean people makes world peace more guaranteed. The working people of the world should unite and stop the aggression of American imperialism." After the meeting, workers Gu Yuanquan and Liu Bingsen said: "We must resolutely defeat American imperialism's aggression!" The factory's waist drum team also challenged the song team, saying that they were not afraid of the heat or fatigue, and decided to go to various places outside the factory to conduct anti-aggression propaganda after work every day from the 20th to the 25th without eating.

	The Beijing Tram Repair Factory Union began to arrange propaganda work on the 18th. All the propagandists cooperated with the art team to rush to produce propaganda cartoons; on the 19th, they posted big-character posters to introduce the situation of the Korean War to the workers; and in the afternoon of the 20th, they convened a lecture meeting; after listening to the lectures, the workers in various departments organized discussions in their spare time. At the discussion, the workers spoke enthusiastically. Foreman Zhang Zhiqing said: "When Taiwan is liberated, the whole team must make a new car called 'Taiwan Liberation' to express our celebration." The teacher who is researching the roller baffle said: "We must use creating new records to support the Korean people." The riveters' team decided to express their determination by completing the annual production task by early September. The team also challenged the carpenters' team, and the carpenters' team has already responded.

	The Liulihe Cement Plant established a Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea on the 17th, responsible for leading propaganda work, and has formed a Propaganda Brigade for Defending World Peace, which includes a waist drum team, a living newspaper, a children's team, and a recitation team, etc., equipped with a large number of slogan cartoons, ready to carry out propaganda to people from all walks of life, while展开ing peace signatures.

	In order to deeply propagate the atrocities of American imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, the 70th Ordnance Factory first used blackboards, express reports, and other means to展开 written propaganda; and printed Korean situation maps and posted them in various workshops, constantly pointing out the victorious situation of the People's Army; the broadcasting team used the lunch time to broadcast news about opposing American aggression. The workers unanimously stated: "We workers resolutely oppose American aggression in Taiwan and Korea!" Song Jinyue said: "We Chinese people have personally tasted the oppression of the Japanese. The United States continues to support the reactionary forces of Japan and wants to invade Taiwan, which is to make the Chinese people slaves of the United States again." Yan Zhongyin said: "Imperialists die faster when they start a war. The Korean people are beating them so they have nowhere to run. The atomic bomb can never conquer the power of the people!" Liu Denghua said: "The United States manipulates the Security Council, and Britain and France listen to it, but the people do not listen to it!" Tian Qiwang and Wang Yueduo both said: "We workers must only increase production and use practical actions to oppose American aggression!"
