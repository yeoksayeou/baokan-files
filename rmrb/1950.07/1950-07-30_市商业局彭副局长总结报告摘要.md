[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The following is a summary of the report by Peng Cheng, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, at the Beijing Municipal Department Store Production and Sales Conference:

    Achievements of the Conference

    I. Achieved a unified understanding of improving department store production and sales. The biggest achievement of this conference is that all representatives, in the spirit of improving the entire department store production and sales business, conducted in-depth discussions on the current problems in Beijing's department store production and sales, as well as how to overcome current difficulties and future directions for effort. Everyone reached a consensus that the main reasons for the current difficulties in Beijing's department store production and sales are: the cessation of false purchasing power after price stabilization, the real purchasing power has not yet increased; some department store commodities are not suitable for current needs; Beijing's production base is relatively weak and scattered, and the quality of most products has not yet been improved; and there is a lack of close cooperation between public and private production and sales, a lack of planning in production and sales, and blindness and irrationality in operation. However, these difficulties are temporary and can be overcome, as long as public and private production and sales cooperate closely, work together, and improve operations, especially with the promising autumn harvest this year and the implementation of land reform in the North China region, Beijing's department store production and sales business has a bright future.

    II. Strengthened public-private relations and production-sales relations. In the past, our public-private relations and production-sales relations were not close enough. In this conference, representatives of state-owned department stores and other representatives reviewed the fact that state-owned companies in the past controlled price differences between production and sales areas, wholesale and retail profits, and had little contact with the department store industry, resulting in prices sometimes being unreasonable (including prices for supplying raw materials to factories and purchasing finished products), and lacking appropriate planning. Representatives of private factories believed that state-owned department stores provided great support to department store production, and sometimes even lost money. In the future, they must overcome their reliance mentality and improve operations. Private department stores reviewed that they had paid little attention to promoting Beijing products in the past, with 80% of the commodities operated by department stores being non-Beijing products. Of the 29 representative commodities discussed for pricing by department stores, only two were Beijing products. But this does not mean that all Beijing products are of poor quality and high price. For example, inner tubes, sneakers, and soaps, some of which are very good, but we have preconceived notions in the past that Beijing department store products are of poor quality and high price and cannot be improved. This idea is inappropriate and should be corrected. Otherwise, it will reduce the enthusiasm for improving and supporting Beijing production. After this meeting, mutual understanding was achieved, further understanding of one's own shortcomings was gained, and a willingness to work hard to overcome them was expressed. This spirit is very good and has laid a good foundation for us to improve Beijing's department store production and sales business. We hope that everyone will work together to implement the spirit of this conference.

    How to Improve Production and Sales Business

    I. Current production policy of Beijing department stores. The national department store production and sales situation is being adjusted, but everyone does not yet have an accurate understanding of the current national and Beijing department store production and sales situation. At the same time, there is overproduction of some Beijing department store products, so we must be cautious in determining our policy. We must see Beijing, see the whole country; see the present, and consider the future. Therefore, the current production policy of Beijing department stores should be: on the existing basis, massively improve technology, improve quality, reduce costs, formulate specifications and brands, and adapt to new needs; face the broad masses of citizens, face the vast countryside, and gradually restore and develop with emphasis, planning, and steps.

    II. Establish production and sales consultation groups, strengthen public-private relations and production-sales relations, strengthen planning, and overcome blindness:

    ① In order to plan department store production and sales and overcome blind operation, a department store production and sales consultation group can be established under the leadership of the government, composed of representatives from public and private manufacturers and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, responsible for formulating a general operating plan and price standards for department store production and sales for a certain period, and studying how to improve operations.

    ② Specific production plans for department stores and figures for state-owned trading companies to support production can be determined by the production and sales consultation group and relevant industries for a certain period. The state-owned company's support figures will be maintained for the time being until the national plan is determined. Private department stores should pay attention to promoting Beijing products, and no figures will be specified for the time being. Department store factories must improve technology, improve quality, and reduce costs, and should not have a reliance mentality.

    ③ Regarding the issue of adjusting the scope of operation of state-owned department stores, specific plans can be drawn up by the department stores and submitted to the government for approval and implementation.

    ④ The issue of controlling the price difference between production and sales areas, wholesale and retail, can be resolved through price negotiation. The Price Research Group will soon be changed to a Price Negotiation Group.

    ⑤ It is necessary for state-owned trading companies to reasonably and plannedly supply factories with a portion of raw materials. We hope that factories will formulate plans and sign contracts with state-owned trading companies, so that trading companies can supply production in a planned manner based on needs and possibilities.

    ⑥ Department stores should be encouraged to sell or distribute goods on behalf of department store factories. This can make production and sales planned, easily open up sales channels, save capital, and facilitate turnover. But credit must be maintained. The key to the abnormal production and sales relationship in the past lies here. Today, price stability provides new favorable conditions.

    Improve Operations and Open up Sales Channels

    I. Labor-management unity to improve operating enthusiasm. Whether an enterprise operates well or not, whether labor and management are united is one of the determining factors. Therefore, labor and management must be united, and the operating enthusiasm of industrialists, businessmen, and the vast number of employees must be enhanced to tide over the current difficulties and enable business to recover and develop.

    II. Vigorously improve technology, improve quality, reduce costs, and formulate specifications and brands. Adapt to market needs, small profits but quick turnover, careful calculation, and implement scientific management. This is the general direction for improving Beijing's department store production and sales operations. In order to realize the above projects, the following tasks must be done well: conscientiously put out some capital and energy to establish normal production and sales relations; quickly establish dyeing companies and factories of a similar nature to solve the difficulties of insufficient equipment, funds, and technology; combine the purchase of marketable local products to organize the sales of industrial products to the countryside (today, price stability and transportation recovery provide this condition); directly and reasonably obtain raw materials to reduce costs; our products must be practical and inexpensive to meet the needs of the countryside, and improve quality and appropriate prices to meet the needs of the city.

    III. Regarding the issue of joint operations, it can be implemented. This can concentrate capital, manpower, technology and equipment; strengthen planning in operation, and save expenses. But it must be based on voluntary mutual benefit and prevent manipulation and dependence.

    Several Specific Issues

    I. Regarding the issue of loans, the National Bank has relaxed its standards. As long as it is for improving business and their own capital is insufficient, loans can generally be granted. Xingye Company can also invest in industries that need to be improved and expanded.

    II. The issue of establishing a glycerol factory to reduce soap costs can be considered.

    III. The government should provide appropriate guidance to production that is already excessive or saturated to avoid blind development.

    IV. The method of establishing a product exhibition room to promote Beijing products is very good and can be implemented. State-owned trading companies should provide more assistance.

    V. The issue of establishing sales stations is feared that it cannot solve much problem at present. It is best to organize trade groups to purchase local products and sell industrial products to the countryside for transactions. The prices should be appropriate, and attention should be paid to mutual benefit, credit, and contact with local governments, public and private stores.

　　市商业局彭副局长总结报告摘要
    【京市新闻处讯】市商业局彭城副局长在京市百货产销会议上的总结报告摘要如下：
    大会收获
    一、对改进百货产销取得了一致的认识。此次大会最大的收获是：各位代表都以改进整个百货产销业务的精神，对目前京市百货产销存在的问题，以及如何度过目前困难和今后的努力方向，进行了深入的讨论。大家取得了一致的认识，认为目前京市百货产销存在困难的主要原因是：物价稳定后虚假购买力停止，真实购买力尚未提高；部分百货商品不适合目前需要；京市生产基础比较薄弱分散，大部产品质量尚未提高；公私产销缺乏密切配合，产销缺乏计划，经营中存在着盲目性及不合理现象。但这种困难是暂时的，可以克服的，只要公私产销密切配合，共同努力，改善经营，尤其今年秋收有望，华北地区已实行土改，京市百货产销业务是有光明前途的。
    二、密切了公私关系与产销关系。以往我们的公私关系、产销关系均不够密切，在此次会议中，国营百货公司代表与其他代表都检讨了国营公司过去在掌握产地与销地差价、批发与零售利润，和百货业联系很少，致有时价格不够合理（包括供给工厂原料收购成品的价格），并缺乏适当的计划。私营工厂代表认为，国营百货公司对百货生产是有很大扶植，并且有时还要赔钱，今后定要克服依赖思想，改善经营。私营百货业检讨过去很少注意推销京市产品，百货业经营的商品百分之八十为非北京产品，百货议价的二十九种代表商品，京市产品只选了二种。但这并不等于京市产品均是货次价高，像球胎、球鞋、香皂等，有的很好，而是我们过去在思想上有京市百货产品货次价高、无法改进的成见，这种思想是不当的，应该纠正。否则会减少改进扶植京市生产的积极性。经过此次会议，互相得到了解，对自己的缺点有了进一步的认识，并愿努力克服。这种精神很好，给我们改进京市百货产销业务打下了良好开端，希望大家共同努力，贯彻此次会议精神。
    如何改进产销业务
    一、目前京市百货生产方针。全国百货产销情况正在调整，但大家对全国与京市百货产销情况现在还没有精确了解，同时京市百货生产有的过剩，所以我们确定方针，必须慎重。要看到京市，看到全国；看到现在，顾及将来。因而京市目前百货业的生产方针应该是：在现有基础上，大量改进技术，提高质量，减低成本，制定规格牌号，适应新的需要；面向广大市民、面向广大农村，有重点、有计划、有步骤地逐渐恢复与发展。
    二、建立产销协商小组，密切公私关系与产销关系，加强计划性，克服盲目性：
    ①为了百货产销有计划，克服盲目经营，可以在政府领导下成立百货产销协商小组，由公私厂商和工商联派代表组成，负责制定一定时期百货产销大体经营计划和价格标准，并研究如何改善经营。
    ②百货生产具体计划及国营贸易公司扶植生产数字，可由产销协商小组与有关行业定出一定时期的生产计划，及扶植计划。国营公司扶植数字暂维持现状，等全国计划确定后确定。私营百货业应该注意推销京市生产品，暂不规定数字，百货工厂必须改进技术、提高质量、降低成本，不要存有依赖思想。
    ③关于调整国营百货公司经营范围问题，可由百货公司拟出具体计划，报政府批准执行。
    ④关于产地与销地、批发与零售的价格差额的掌握问题，可通过议价解决，不久即将物价研究小组改为议价小组。
    ⑤关于国营贸易公司合理地有计划地供给工厂一部原料问题，是必要的，希望各工厂制定计划与国营贸易公司订立合同。以便贸易公司根据需要与可能有计划地供应生产。
    ⑥应提倡百货业给百货工厂代销或经销货物，如此可使产销有计划，容易打开销路，节省资金，便于周转。但必须保持信用。过去产销关系不正常的关键就在这里，今天物价稳定，更具备了新的有利条件。
    改善经营打开销路
    一、劳资团结提高经营情绪。一个企业经营的好坏，劳资是否团结是决定的因素之一。因而必须劳资团结，提高工商业者及广大从业员工经营的情绪，同舟共济，以便度过目前困难，使业务得到恢复与发展。
    二、大力改进技术，提高质量，减低成本，制定规格牌号。适应市场需要，薄利多销，精打细算，实行科学管理，这是我们京市百货产销改善经营的总方向。为了实现上项目的，必须作好下面几件工作：认真地拿出些资力精力，建立正常的产销关系；迅速建立整染公司及类似这种性质的工厂，以便解决改进设备与资金技术不足的困难；结合收购有销路的土产，组织工业品下乡（今天物价稳定，交通恢复，已具备了这一条件）；直接、合理地取得原料，以便减低成本；我们的产品一要朴实价廉，适应乡村需要，一要提高质量，价格适当，适合城市需要。
    三、关于联营问题，可以实行。如此可以集中资力、人力、技术设备；经营加强计划，节省开支。但必须是建筑在自愿两利基础上，防止操纵和依赖。
    几个具体问题
    一、贷款问题，国家银行已放宽尺度，只要是为了改进业务，自己资力不足，一般的均可贷给，需要改进与扩充的工业，兴业公司尚可投资。
    二、建立甘油工厂，减低肥皂成本问题，可以考虑。
    三、目前已经过剩或饱和的生产，政府应给以适当的指导，避免盲目发展。
    四、成立产品展览室借以推广京市产品的办法很好，可以办理，国营贸易公司应多协助。
    五、推销站设立问题，恐目前不能解决多大问题，最好组织收购土产与推销工业品的贸易小组下乡进行交易，价格应适当，并注意两利、有信用，与当地政府、公私商店取得联系。
