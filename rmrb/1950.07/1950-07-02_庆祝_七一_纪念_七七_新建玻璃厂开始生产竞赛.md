    Newly Built Glass Factory Starts Production Competition
    [Our Newspaper] The newly built glass factory has launched a large-scale production competition to celebrate "July 1st" and commemorate "July 7th." The goals of the competition are to reduce production losses and improve quality. On June 28th, each production team in the factory formulated a production plan, with special emphasis on improving quality. For example, the mixing room guarantees to eliminate bubbles, willow marks, and white bricks, and also ensures good color. The firing team guarantees to produce more good materials and save coal. The annealing team guarantees that the products will not be flat or cracked, and that losses will be minimized. Each blowing team jointly guarantees that the blown bottles will have consistent thickness, and that the weight will meet the standards, etc. These plans will be implemented in the production competition starting on "July 1st". Many competition slogans and challenge letters have appeared on the wall newspapers and blackboards, and the workers are all preparing to create new records in the competition.
