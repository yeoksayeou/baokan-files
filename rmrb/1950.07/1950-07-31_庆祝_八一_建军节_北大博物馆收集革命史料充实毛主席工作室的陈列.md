    Peking University Museum Collects Revolutionary Historical Materials to Enrich the Display of Chairman Mao's Studio
    [By Our Staff Reporter] To celebrate "August 1st" Army Day, the Peking University Museum has collected revolutionary historical materials from various sources to enrich the displays in Chairman Mao's studio on campus and the Li Dazhao Memorial Room. Recently collected and exhibited items include multiple photographs of Chairman Mao and his comrades during the Ten Years of Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and the People's Liberation War; letters and posthumous writings of Martyr Li Dazhao from the "May Fourth" period discussing the direction of the New Youth magazine with Hu Shi; historical materials from 1925 documenting his leadership of the Beijing people's revolution and the movement to fight for tariff autonomy; and several documents from 1927 on the suppression of the revolutionary movement under the bloody rule of the Feng Clique warlords, running dogs of Japanese imperialism, on the eve of the martyr's death. Many of these materials have never been published before.
    In addition, inscriptions by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, as well as Guo Moruo, Wu Yuzhang, He Xiangning, Liu Bocheng, Lu Dingyi, Ma Xulun, and others for the room are also on display.
