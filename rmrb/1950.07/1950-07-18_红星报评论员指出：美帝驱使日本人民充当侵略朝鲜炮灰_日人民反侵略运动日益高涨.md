　　Red Star Newspaper Commentator Points Out: US Imperialism Drives Japanese People to Serve as Cannon Fodder for Aggression Against Korea
    Anti-Aggression Movement of the Japanese People is Rising Daily
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th] TASS Moscow dispatch: The Red Star newspaper on the 15th commented on the struggle of the Japanese people against turning their country into a bridgehead for American aggression. The commentator wrote: American imperialists are using the Japanese territory under their occupation to bloodily suppress the freedom-loving Korean people, who are fighting against the American aggressors and their Korean lackeys in the Lee Seung-man clique. The Associated Press correspondent in Tokyo reported that all Japanese maritime transport has been mobilized under MacArthur's orders to serve the American military adventure in Korea. MacArthur also ordered the Japanese Navy to patrol the Japanese waters off the Korean coast. The commentator pointed out that this is in fact the Japanese imperialists participating in the criminal war against the Korean people.
    The Japanese reactionaries, led by the Yoshida group, are advocating greater participation in the American war of aggression against Korea. The American occupation authorities in Japan are doing everything possible to encourage this aggressive ambition of Japanese imperialism, and they have already turned Japan into their arsenal and military base in the Far East. Japan is covered with a network of naval and air bases, which the United States intends to keep as its property for a long time. Moreover, the Wall Street bosses are already using the Japanese as cannon fodder for their armed aggression against Korea. The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced on July 7 that hired Japanese soldiers had participated in the Korean War. After the battle in the Suwon area, thirty Japanese officers were found among the dead bodies.
    The author emphasized that the people of Asia and the people of the world resolutely condemn the armed aggression of the American and British imperialists against the Korean people. It is also pointed out that the movement of the Japanese people protesting against American aggression is also rising. Anti-war leaflets have been distributed in Tokyo, Yokohama, Hiroshima and other Japanese cities. Many trade unions and civil organizations are actively opposed to Japan's participation in the intervention in Korea. Joint committees have been established by construction workers' unions in Tsurumi and Kanagawa and local groups of Korean residents to fight against the transportation of munitions to South Korea.
    The author concluded: The Japanese people, together with the people of Asia and the world, demand an end to American intervention in Korea. Moreover, they are strongly opposed to the United States using Japan as a base for aggression in the Far East. The advanced people of Japan are fighting for peace, freedom, democracy and independence.

　　红星报评论员指出：美帝驱使日本人民充当侵略朝鲜炮灰
    日人民反侵略运动日益高涨
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报于十五日评论日本人民为反对把他们的国家变成美国侵略的桥头堡而进行的斗争。评论员写道：美帝国主义者正利用他们占领下的日本领土，来血腥地镇压爱好自由的朝鲜人民，他们正在与美国侵略者及其在李承晚集团中的朝鲜走狗作战。美联社驻东京的记者报道，日本全部的海上运输工具，已奉麦克阿瑟的命令动员起来，为美国在朝鲜的军事冒险服务。麦克阿瑟并命令日本海军在朝鲜海岸的日本海上担任巡逻。评论员指出：这事实上就是日本帝国主义者参加了对朝鲜人民的罪恶战争。
    以吉田集团为首的日本反动派，正主张在更大的程度上参加美国侵略朝鲜的战争。在日本的美国占领当局，对日本帝国主义的这种侵略野心竭尽一切可能加以鼓励，他们已经把日本变成他们在远东的兵工厂和军事基地了。日本全国密布着海空军基地网，美国打算把这些基地当作自己的财产来长期保持。不仅如此，华尔街的头子们已经在利用日本人充当他们武装侵略朝鲜的炮灰。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军最高统帅部七月七日公报称：雇佣的日本兵已参加了朝鲜战争。水原地区的战役之后，在被击毙的尸体中发现有三十名日本军官。
    作者强调指出：亚洲人民和全世界人民坚决谴责美英帝国主义者对朝鲜人民的武装侵略。并指出：日本人民中抗议美国侵略的运动也在日益高涨。东京、横滨、广岛和其他的日本城市都散发有反战传单。许多的工会和民间团体都积极反对日本参加干涉朝鲜。鹤见和神奈川两地的建筑工人工会和朝鲜侨民的地方团体已成立联合委员会，为反对向南朝鲜运送军火而斗争。
    作者结语称：日本人民和亚洲以及全世界的人民一道要求停止美国在朝鲜的干涉。不仅如此，他们也极力反对美国利用日本为在远东进行侵略的基地。日本的先进人民正为和平、自由、民主与独立而斗争。
