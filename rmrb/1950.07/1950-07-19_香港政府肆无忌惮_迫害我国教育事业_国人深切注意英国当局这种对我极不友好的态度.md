Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: News from Hong Kong: Incidents of the Hong Kong British government suppressing our patriotic and democratic education continue to occur. The Hong Kong Hanhua Middle School, founded four years ago, is facing the threat of "cancellation of registration." Since its establishment four years ago, the school has consistently implemented patriotic and democratic education, achieving remarkable results and winning the love of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. After the founding of the People's Republic of China Central People's Government last October, the school made good contributions to patriotic movements such as comforting troops and purchasing public bonds.

On June 13th, the Hong Kong British government's education authorities, using the excuse that the school's "fire prevention equipment was inadequate," notified Hanhua Middle School that its registration would be canceled one month later. Huang Jianli, the acting principal of the school, sent a letter to the Hong Kong Government's Director of Education on the 23rd to protest. The letter pointed out that the Education Director's unreasonable measures infringed upon the freedom of Hong Kong people to run schools. In order to protect the rights of all 700 faculty, staff, and students to work and study, the authorities were asked to withdraw their decision. The school also angrily condemned the Hong Kong government's unreasonable behavior at the weekly meeting on the 26th and launched a fervent school protection movement.

The Hong Kong government's deliberate act of harming the patriotic and democratic education of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon has aroused the anger of the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Under the unanimous condemnation of all teachers, students, and staff of the school and the broad masses of people and public opinion, the Hong Kong British government's Information Office played tricks at a press conference on the 28th, denying that it had revoked the school's registration, but still insisted that the school's "fire prevention equipment was inadequate" and needed to be improved immediately. It has been verified that the school building is a solid steel-concrete structure. In addition to a four-foot-wide terrazzo staircase, there is also a terrazzo fire escape leading directly to the basement. Therefore, the so-called "fire prevention problem" is purely an excuse. After the Information Office issued the news, the school received another official letter from the Education Department on the 29th, ordering it to "improve fire prevention equipment" before July 13th, otherwise the registration would still be canceled.

In addition to attempting to revoke the registration of Hanhua Middle School, the Hong Kong Government Education Department has also adopted high-handed measures against other educational institutions. In the past half-month, personnel from the political department of the Education Department have personally searched the schoolbags and drawers of students in a dozen middle and primary schools, arbitrarily infringing upon students' freedom to study, and recklessly suppressing our country's patriotic and democratic education. This extremely unfriendly attitude of the British authorities towards the Chinese people has aroused the deep attention of the people of our country.

　　香港政府肆无忌惮
    迫害我国教育事业
    国人深切注意英国当局这种对我极不友好的态度
    【新华社广州十六日电】香港消息：香港英政府压迫我爱国民主教育事业的事件不断发生，创校四年的香港汉华中学，正遭受“取消注册”的威胁。该校创校四年来，一贯实施爱国民主教育，成绩卓著，深得港九同胞的爱护。去年十月，中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立后，该校在劳军、购买公债等爱国运动中，都有良好贡献。
    六月十三日，香港英政府教育当局借口该校“防火设备不周”，通知汉华中学将于一个月后取消该校注册。该校代理校长黄建立于二十三日特函复香港政府教育司，表示抗议。信中指出教育司此种无理措施，实侵犯香港人民办学之自由。为保障全校七百员生职业及学习的权利，要求当局收回成命。该校并于二十六日周会中激愤控诉香港政府的无理行为，发起热烈的护校运动。
    香港政府此种蓄意残害我港九同胞爱国民主教育事业之行为，引起港九广大同胞的愤怒。在该校全体师生员工及广大社会人士与舆论的一致指责之下，港英政府新闻处于二十八日招待记者会中，竟又玩弄手段，否认已撤销该校注册，但仍坚持谓该校“防火设备不周”，须立即改善。查该校校舍为钢骨水泥之坚固建筑，除有四尺阔之三合土大楼梯外，尚有三合土防火救生梯一道，直通地下。因此所谓“防火问题”，完全是借口。在新闻处发表消息后，该校于二十九日又接到教育司公函，限令在七月十三日以前“改善防火设备”，否则仍要取消注册。
    香港政府教育司除正企图撤销汉华中学注册外，对其他教育机关也同样采取高压手段。半个月来教育司政治部人员，曾亲自出动搜查过十数座中、小学校学生的书包和抽屉，随意侵害学生学习自由，肆无忌惮地压制我国爱国民主教育事业。英国当局这种对于中国人民的极不友好的表示，已引起国人深切注意。
