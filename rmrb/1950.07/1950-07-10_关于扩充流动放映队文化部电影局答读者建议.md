　　Regarding the reader Yang Ruixuan's letter published in the People's Garden on June 19th, suggesting the establishment of rural film projection stations, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture provides the following information about our plan for this year.
    In order to strengthen film projection work among workers, peasants, and soldiers, in addition to the existing one hundred mobile projection teams scattered throughout the country, we plan to organize another six hundred teams this year. The "Projection Training Class" held in Nanjing has been formally established, and projection personnel from all over the country have been selected for training. After training, they will be assigned to work in various regions. Mobile projection teams will uniformly use 16mm projectors. A 16mm film developing and printing plant has also been established in Beijing, specializing in developing and printing 16mm films for use by mobile projection teams. It is expected that the plan to expand the projection teams this year can be completed on schedule. By then, people in factories, rural areas, and the military will have more opportunities to watch movies.

　　关于扩充流动放映队文化部电影局答读者建议编辑同志：
    六月十九日人民园地刊载了读者杨瑞轩的来信，建议建立农村电影放映站。兹将我们本年度这方面的计划告诉你们。
    为了在工农兵中加强电影放映工作，除原有分散在全国各地的一百个流动放映队外，我们计划在本年度内再组织六百个队。在南京举办的“放映训练班”已正式成立，抽调全国各地放映人员受训。受训后，再分发各地工作。流动放映队将一律采用十六糎放映机。十六糎影片洗印厂亦已在北京成立，专门洗印十六糎影片，供给流动放映队使用。预计本年度扩充放映队之计划可如期完成。届时在工厂、农村、部队中，人们都将有更多看电影的机会。
