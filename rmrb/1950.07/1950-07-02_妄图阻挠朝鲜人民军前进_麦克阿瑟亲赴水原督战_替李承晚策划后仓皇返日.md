In a Futile Attempt to Hinder the Advance of the Korean People's Army
    MacArthur Personally Supervised the Battle in Suwon
    Hastily Returned to Japan after Plotting for Syngman Rhee
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st] The Korean Central News Agency on June 30th cited a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the same day, stating: On June 29th, MacArthur personally went to a high point near Suwon to "inspect." Witnessing the heroic advance of the People's Army's tanks, artillery, and mechanized units, he immediately ordered American planes to bomb important transportation lines and bridges in an attempt to hinder the People's Army's advance, and instructed American planes to bomb peaceful cities and residents. After personally directing the bandit troops' battle and devising a battle plan for the Rhee bandit, MacArthur hastily flew back to Japan. The Korean Central News Agency stated: The American and Rhee bandits are colluding with each other, formulating various conspiracies and schemes, vainly attempting to make the Korean people submit to them. However, the Korean people, fighting for the unification, independence, democracy, and freedom of their motherland, are bound to achieve final victory.

　　妄图阻挠朝鲜人民军前进
    麦克阿瑟亲赴水原督战
    替李承晚策划后仓皇返日
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜中央通讯社六月三十日引合众社东京同日电称：六月二十九日，麦克阿瑟亲自到水原近郊的高处“视察”。他目睹了正在英勇进击的人民军的坦克、炮兵和机械化部队，立即命令美机轰炸重要交通线与桥梁，以期阻挠人民军的前进，并指示美机轰炸和平的城市与居民。麦克阿瑟在亲自指挥了匪军的战斗，并替李匪订立了作战计划后，即仓皇飞回日本。朝鲜中央通讯社称：美李狼狈为奸，制订各种阴谋诡计，妄图使朝鲜人民向他们屈服。但为祖国的统一、独立、民主、自由而战的朝鲜人民，是一定要获得最后胜利的。
