　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 27th (TASS): Despite calls and attempts by the US government and reactionary union bosses to persuade ordinary union members and workers to avoid strikes and coordinate with employers for the sake of the Korean War, strikes are still breaking out in enterprises across the country. Employers are taking advantage of the domestic hysteria about war mobilization, desperately seizing the opportunity to profit at the expense of American workers and taxpayers, and the striking workers are rising up to oppose these employers.
    According to an Associated Press report: Twelve thousand carpenters in twelve towns in California continue to strike. The striking workers disagree with returning to work under the terms already accepted by the union leadership and insist on full satisfaction of their demands.
    According to an Associated Press report: On July 24th, four thousand five hundred workers at two wharves belonging to the massive Todd Shipbuilding Corporation went on strike, demanding increased wages. Despite the fact that federal government mediators have been strenuously telling the striking workers that the shipbuilding industry is currently of great importance to the armed forces, the strike continues.
    In Elizabeth, New Jersey, one thousand two hundred workers employed by Phelps Dodge Copper Corporation's factories have gone on strike. They are demanding increased wages, insurance, holiday pay, and improved working conditions.
    In Barnesville, Ohio, three thousand workers at a chemical factory began a strike on July 22nd. The workers declared that they would not return to work until a new contract was signed.
    Seven thousand five hundred oil workers in Texas continue to strike, fighting strongly for increased wages and improved working conditions.
    Due to the strike by one thousand one hundred truck drivers at various construction companies in New York, another twenty thousand construction workers have also been forced to stop work. According to an Associated Press report, this number of strikers will increase to one hundred thousand.
