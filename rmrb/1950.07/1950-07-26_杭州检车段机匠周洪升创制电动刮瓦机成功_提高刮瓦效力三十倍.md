Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 24th: Zhou Hongsheng, a mechanic at the Hangzhou Inspection Depot of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, has successfully created an electric tile scraper, increasing tile scraping efficiency by thirty times, enabling the depot to promptly supply the more than two hundred newly cast axle tiles needed each month. Axle tiles are the most important fitting for vehicle wheels, installed on the upper part of the axle journal. When inspecting various vehicles, the axle tiles must be removed for inspection. If the lead material on the axle tile has worn down to between three and one centimeter, it needs to be replaced. However, newly cast finished products are rough castings, and in the past, they needed to be filed and corrected manually, taking two hours per tile. In March of this year, Zhou Hongsheng, a mechanic at the mechanical workshop, used his spare time and holidays to create a hand-cranked tile scraper. It only takes twenty-five minutes to scrape a tile, and it can be applied after two minutes of on-site repair. In mid-May, Zhou Hongsheng drew up blueprints for an electric tile scraper, selected a model, and began research. With the assistance of inspectors like Zhong Shibao, a small electric tile scraper was finally successfully completed on May 27th. According to test results, the new tile scraper can rotate once every twenty-five seconds, and a newly cast axle tile can be scraped in two minutes, ready for use after two minutes of on-site repair. Work efficiency has increased thirty-fold compared to before. This invention has been praised by the Ministry of Railways.

　　杭州检车段机匠周洪升创制电动刮瓦机成功
    提高刮瓦效力三十倍
    【新华社上海二十四日电】上海铁路局杭州检车段机匠周洪升，创制电动刮瓦机成功，提高刮瓦效力三十倍，使该段能及时供应每月需用的二百多块新铸轴瓦。按车辆轮子中最主要的配件是装置轴颈上部的“轴瓦”，在检修各种车辆时均需将轴瓦起出检验，如果轴瓦上的铅质已磨耗到三至一厘米，就要重新调换。但是新铸成品均是毛坯，过去需用人工锉光削正，每块要锉二小时。今年三月机械工场机匠周洪升利用工余及例假时间，制成一只手摇的刮瓦机，一块轴瓦只需二十五分钟时间即可刮好，再到现场去经过二分钟修理即可应用。五月中旬，周洪升又画出电动刮瓦机图样，制选模型，开始研究，并得到检车匠钟士宝等的协助配制，终于在五月二十七日胜利完成了一座小型电动刮瓦机。经试验结果，新刮瓦机能在二十五秒钟内周转一次，一块新铸的轴瓦在二分钟内即可刮好，再经现场二分钟的修理，即可使用。工作效率已较前提高三十倍。此项发明已经得到铁道部的表扬。
