　　Hebei Province's Communications Work
    Hebei Daily Editorial Department
    Below is a piece of material regarding communications work from Hebei Daily. This material has experience that can be referenced, but it is not the only method for developing correspondents. This is because Hebei Province's communications work has its own characteristics, namely, the close integration of communications work and Party committee work, born under the education of the entire Party running the newspaper for over a decade. Newspapers lacking this historical condition, if they are asked to immediately follow suit, will inevitably first attribute the responsibility for developing correspondents to the CCP Party Committee and thus relax their own efforts. For Party newspapers, the leadership of the Party Committee is important, but the newspaper's own efforts are equally important. The two must be combined to establish sound and effective communications work. Regarding this issue, this journal will continue to select materials in the future for reference by newspapers in various locations.
                                Editor
    Hebei Province's communications work, after more than ten years of development, has woven a dense network, spread throughout the province. There are over 16,000 correspondents, connected to Hebei Daily through various crisscrossing lines. Most of the major events and general work situations and problems in various parts of the province can be reflected to the newspaper in a timely manner. In terms of the number of manuscripts used, according to statistics from January, February, and March of this year, excluding those that were left behind by communication organizations at all levels after preliminary selection, as they were deemed unsuitable for reporting, an average of 3,640 pieces were submitted to the newspaper each month (according to statistics from Tangshan Prefecture for two and a half months, correspondents wrote an average of 1,371 pieces each month, and after preliminary selection by the county communications officers, an average of only 570 pieces were submitted to the prefectural committee communications officers each month; the prefectural committee communications officers selected again, submitting an average of 273 pieces to the newspaper each month. According to this calculation, the manuscripts received by the newspaper only account for one-fifth of the total number of manuscripts written by correspondents; correspondents throughout the province write an average of approximately 18,200 pieces each month. The number of manuscripts adopted by the newspaper only accounts for 15 to 20 percent of the manuscripts received by the newspaper). In addition, many work reports, summaries, and other materials from various levels and departments (mainly Party committees and governments) can be regularly sent to the newspaper. Some people also constantly write letters to the newspaper reporting on work situations. Hebei Daily's "Inquiry Office" receives an average of more than 1,800 letters each month, and the supplement directly receives more than 200 submissions each month, which are not included in the above manuscript count.
    The organization of the communications network is as follows:
    Hebei Daily Editorial Department (before the implementation of the integration of editing, reporting, and liaison) had a Communications Liaison Section (12 people), and the Propaganda Departments of local, municipal, county, and town committees all had communications officers, who were professional communications workers. Part-time positions included: report secretaries in various departments and bureaus of the provincial government and various special offices, some factories had communications officers, and the Tangshan Prefectural offices had Party newspaper officers. Each county (town) has a central communications group, composed of responsible cadres from various county-level departments and the county committee communications officers, which plays a core promoting role in the communication work of the county (town), and is generally led by the county party secretary personally. One-third of the central communication groups are effective. Correspondents in various places generally form communication groups, organized by department above the county level, and by district, village, factory, and school below the district level.
    We divided the correspondents into three types: those who write frequently and actively, and whose manuscripts are of high quality, are hired by the newspaper as special correspondents or special reporters, totaling 270 people throughout the province, including 5 prefectural committee members and 88 county committee members. Those who can write regularly are designated as backbone correspondents by the prefectural (municipal) committee propaganda department or county (town) committee propaganda department, totaling 1,068 people throughout the province. Those who sometimes write, but may not write for a long time, are ordinary correspondents, totaling over 16,000 people throughout the province. Among the ordinary correspondents, more than one-third are correspondents who do not play a significant role or are nominally correspondents.
    The vast majority of these correspondents were not directly developed by the newspaper, but rather, under the principle of "the entire Party running the newspaper" for many years, Party committees at all levels have regarded leading communications work as one of their daily tasks, conducting, arranging, mobilizing, inspecting, and summarizing it regularly. For example, when Hebei Daily launched a writing campaign in January of this year, the newspaper's arrangements had not yet been issued, but the radio station broadcasted it first. After hearing it on the radio, the Raoyang County Committee immediately studied it and made arrangements at an enlarged cadre meeting of the county and districts. Party committees at all levels regularly called on everyone to start writing for the Party newspaper, universally establish communication groups, and assist communication work cadres in regularly holding correspondent symposiums. Writing was proposed as a task that everyone must do, with the suggestion that after completing a task, it must be reported in a timely manner. “Leaders should take responsibility and take the initiative.” Party committees at all levels also regularly checked cadres' understanding of writing, criticized the thought of looking down on writing, and praised or commended those who valued communication work or wrote actively in newspapers and meetings or through circulated notices. Responsible cadres who neglected communication work or did not write for a long time were criticized or even criticized through circulated notices. Government departments and various people's organizations also regularly arranged communication work through their own organizational systems, regarding communication work as one of the contents of lower-level reports or summaries to higher levels. For example, in the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the director personally led the communication work and personally wrote and revised manuscripts for others. There is a very sound communication organization in the water conservancy work system. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau's communication group regularly proposes reporting points on water conservancy work, both as a reference for the newspaper and as a basis for communication reporting at all levels in the system. The Dingxian Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Tax Bureau have regular guidance for the correspondents in their lower-level organizations.
    After the communication groups were established in various places, they reported to the newspaper, and the newspaper conducted liaison and guidance. When a correspondent started writing for the newspaper, the newspaper immediately grabbed onto them and did not let go. In the initial stage, every manuscript was replied to and every letter was replied to. If the manuscript could not be published, specific suggestions were patiently put forward, telling them how they should write in the future, or how this manuscript could be written to be published. Correspondents who published manuscripts were encouraged to continue writing more.
    During the land reform in 1947, there were work teams everywhere, and the work teams also had communication group leaders or were specifically responsible for communication reporting work. The newspaper made direct contact with these people, and the land reform situation and problems in various places could be quickly reflected to the newspaper.
    In addition, the communication publications published by the newspaper in the early stage were issued to all correspondents, one copy for each person. In addition to providing guidance through this publication, it also had some encouraging effects. Some people felt that if they did not write after receiving the communication publication, they would be letting the newspaper down. If a correspondent did not write for a considerable period of time, the newspaper wrote to contact them, even writing several letters, so they started writing again. After receiving the newspaper's letter, the correspondents felt particularly warm and were greatly encouraged. Many people became good friends with the newspaper in this way. For example, some people took the initiative to notify the newspaper when they were transferred, and some even notified the newspaper when they took sick leave, explaining how many days they could not write.
    The newspaper and some prefectures and counties have adopted the method of awarding model correspondents and communication groups, which also has a considerable encouraging effect.
    In this way, everyone recognized that writing is everyone's responsibility, and it is wrong not to write or to neglect communication work. However, some correspondents have always been nominal, thinking that it is not okay not to do work, but it does not matter if they do not write, and that writing is an extra burden.
    Hebei Province's communication work has developed and consolidated in this way.
    By last year (1949), the communication organization had become even larger, and there were even more correspondents. It was no longer possible to reply to every manuscript and every letter as before, and indeed a considerable number of correspondents were nominal. Therefore, the working methods of communication liaison were changed, and backbone correspondents were gradually established, special reporters and special correspondents were hired, and the method of molting was adopted to gradually streamline the communication organization. In Hebei Province, this is the law of development of the communication organization from widespread development to consolidation to streamlining.
    Later, the newspaper's Communication Liaison Section mainly led the communication officers and special reporters and special correspondents of the local, municipal, county, and town committees in terms of business, and also had certain contact with the county (town) central communication groups. The prefectural committee communication officer mainly led the communication officers of the various counties (towns) in terms of business and contacted the central communication groups of the various counties (towns). Some of the backbone correspondents were directly controlled by the prefectural (municipal) committee communication officers, and some were controlled by the county (town) committee communication officers. The prefectural, municipal, county, and town committee communication officers were also local reporters for the newspaper, conducting key interviews in addition to communication liaison work. Except for the manuscripts of special reporters and special correspondents, which were sent directly to the newspaper's Communication Liaison Section after being reviewed by the county (town) committee, general manuscripts were sent to the prefectural committee propaganda department communication officer after being reviewed by the county committee. Some county (town) committee communication officers also conducted preliminary selection of the manuscripts, and those that were considered to be of too low quality were directly returned without being sent to the prefectural committee propaganda department. The prefectural committee communication officer divided the incoming manuscripts into three categories: the better ones were forwarded to the newspaper in their original form, those that could not be published independently were comprehensively rewritten and then sent to the newspaper, and those that could not be used were returned or accumulated as materials.
    In addition to letters, the newspaper's Communication Liaison Section frequently contacted various places by telephone, and those who were far away used long-distance telephone calls. (When the province was first established, local (municipal) committees had radio stations to send manuscripts, and there were frequent telegrams). Especially when urgent tasks arrived, such as rushing to plant after rain, the Communication Liaison Section used telephones day and night to direct the organization of reports in various places, and various places sent manuscripts to the newspaper by telephone. At ordinary times, there were also frequent cases of people sending a manuscript that they considered to be better and more time-sensitive from hundreds of miles away. In addition, for a sudden task, such as reporting on a battle during the war, and reporting on production and disaster relief in the heavily affected areas of Ninghe, Baodi, Jixian, and Yutian last winter and this spring, the newspaper sent reporter groups with radio stations to conduct reports. In addition to sending reporter manuscripts, the radio station also sent better manuscripts from correspondents.
    Hebei Province's communication work has reached a considerable scale, and the number of correspondents and the number of submissions are quite large. However, there are still some tendencies towards formalism. The vast communication network has not been fully established on the basis of cadres and active elements among the workers and peasants (of course, a considerable part still relies on active elements). Most of the communication organizations float on the upper level and have not penetrated into the broad masses. Attention has not been paid to the training of worker-peasant correspondents. In the past, there were some rural communication groups, and some of them had good results, but they were all abandoned after the establishment of the province. After entering the city, no active worker communication groups were established. In the past communication work, more emphasis was placed on pursuing the number of correspondents and the number of manuscripts, and even challenges and competitions were held, stipulating that each person must write several manuscripts each month (some areas still have this tendency). Insufficient emphasis was placed on improving quality, so many communication manuscripts still feel fragmented, piecemeal, empty, and some have a certain degree of blindness and drift.
    Improving the quality of correspondents and manuscripts is a serious task, and it must be gradually improved through long-term efforts. Impatience is not an option. In this regard, we have adopted the following methods:
    1. Combining comprehensive guidance with key use of communication organizations, grasping the most important link in communication work - actively organizing manuscripts, giving topics and writing articles.
    It is no longer possible to grasp every correspondent very tightly with the development of communication organizations to the current situation, and it is no longer possible to adopt the method of replying to every manuscript and every letter, but the existing organization cannot be completely abandoned. Therefore, in addition to comprehensive general guidance, it is necessary to grasp key use. The newspaper grasps the communication officers of the local, municipal, county, and town committees, the central communication groups of the county (town) committees, special reporters, and special correspondents (many of whom are main cadres at all levels), strengthens liaison and guidance with them, and according to the reporting materials from various places, the problems seen in the manuscripts, and the characteristics of various places, actively gives them topics and writes articles, designating specific people to write, or organizing them through them. For example, the newspaper frequently writes letters or calls Ma Huamin, a special reporter from Qingyuan (county party secretary), to organize special reports, and he can always write them quickly. The central communication group led by Comrade Ma Huamin also plays a role. He and the county head and propaganda minister divide the leadership of the communication work of various departments, frequently urging, inspecting, and providing specific assistance and training to correspondents. When Comrade Ma Huamin finds that the work of a department has improved or has problems, he gives the correspondent of that department a topic and tells him how to write it. After writing it, Comrade Ma Huamin personally modifies it in detail. When cadres go to the countryside, they also personally instruct how to pay attention to organizing reports.
    The communication officers of various local (municipal) committees also frequently adopt the method of giving topics and writing articles. For example, after the Baoding prefectural committee communication officer gave topics, twelve county party secretaries, thirteen county committee propaganda ministers, and eight county heads in the prefecture (which has seventeen counties) started writing. The quality of the manuscripts was significantly improved. In order to emphasize improving the quality of manuscripts, the prefecture also stipulated that each county could only submit 20 to 35 manuscripts per month. The materials organized by the Dingxian prefectural committee communication officer with given topics can be adopted by the newspaper 60% to 70% of the time. However, in the early stage, when the prefectural committee communication officer gave topics, because they did not know enough about the situation in various counties, the topics were all the same, and even the topics were mimeographed and distributed to various counties. Some topics did not grasp the different key points of each region and were not suitable for the local situation. For example, some counties in the Tongxian Prefecture believed that the topics given by the prefectural committee communication officer were not appropriate, and they gave another topic themselves and asked the prefectural committee communication officer: "The topic you gave is not good, can we write a different one?"
    When encountering emergency tasks, the method of giving topics and limiting time to write has also been constantly adopted.
    The leadership of the communication organization should also grasp the key points and use the backbone. For example, in the early stage of the writing campaign in January and February of this year, most counties in Dingxian Prefecture had flat leadership, so the quality of the manuscripts was very low; Boye County wrote 146 manuscripts in one month, but the newspaper only adopted three. Later, the prefectural committee propaganda department proposed "streamlining administration and reducing personnel" in the communication organization, implementing the provincial propaganda conference's proposal to maintain 5 to 10 backbone correspondents, 20 ordinary correspondents, and 1 to 2 special correspondents or special reporters in each county; various counties conducted rectification accordingly, and the quality of the manuscripts gradually improved. Counties such as Lulong, Leting, and Zunhua in Tangshan Prefecture have always attached importance to cultivating backbones, so communication work can continue and the quality of manuscripts is better.
    2. Combining communication work with leadership at all levels, combining with the research departments of leadership organs at all levels, and emphasizing responsible cadres writing.
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China truly regards newspapers as an important tool for leading work, grasping newspaper work very tightly, providing convenience in many ways, and often taking the initiative to tell the newspaper which main issues should be grasped and reported on in a certain period. The newspaper also frequently proposes reporting points according to the intentions of the provincial committee, or first proposes specific opinions to ask the provincial committee for instructions. Communication work cadres of prefectural and county committees also frequently adopt this method. For example, the Tianjin prefectural committee communication officer prepared more mature opinions and then went to the prefectural committee to ask for instructions in a planned and purposeful manner. When the communication officer obtained a pile of materials, they asked the prefectural committee for instructions on principles, and according to the principles put forward by the prefectural committee, combined with the specific materials and typical examples they had mastered, they wrote a comprehensive report. Sometimes the communication officer wrote a manuscript and handed it over to the prefectural committee or commissioner for review, and the responsible comrade raised the material to the level of principle and asked the communication officer to reorganize it. When the communication officer discovered important problems from the incoming manuscripts from various places, because the situation was coming faster than the research office, they immediately reported it to the prefectural committee as a basis for leading work. The prefectural committee truly experienced the benefits of communication reporting for work, and paid more attention to it. Whenever work progressed to a stage, the prefectural committee put forward questions, or listed outlines, and communicated with the communication officer to enrich specific materials and write reports. Zhang Zishan, the commissioner of the Tianjin Special Office, said: "Mobilizing main cadres to write can overcome a lot of bureaucracy, because you can't write a report without investigation. Some materials look okay, but when you write them into a manuscript, you feel empty, and you must go back and investigate." He also used the time he spent on the train to write.
    For example, the Wenan County Committee regards the central work of each period and communication work as the same thing, and the work has been greatly helped through reports. For example, the communication officer found that the third district of the county neglected the production leadership of the lightly affected areas, and the county party secretary led the communication officer to conduct an inspection; this material was written into a report. After it was published in the newspaper, the county committee's ideological understanding of this issue became clearer and more certain, so it mobilized cadres from various departments to conduct a general inspection in various districts. The county committee experienced the importance of communication reporting and incorporated this work into its daily guidance. The county party secretary often helped the communication officer study topics and designated specific people to write manuscripts. He also proposed at a cadre meeting that departments that can write good reports must have in-depth work. The county committee also checked the work through reports, asking county and district cadres to write two copies of each manuscript, one for the newspaper and one for the county committee. In this way, the cadres naturally regarded writing as their own responsibility.
    Communication officers of various local (municipal) committees are generally allowed to participate in meetings in order to understand the intentions of the leaders and the overall work situation.
    Many prefectural committee, county committee, and other responsible cadres write themselves, such as all seven members of the Tianjin prefectural committee and all seven members of the Jixian county committee, and Zhang Ziming, the secretary of the Xianghe county committee, wrote 21 manuscripts in two and a half months. However, some responsible cadres still neglect communication work, neither leading nor taking the initiative to write. Some counties transfer more capable communication officers to other jobs.
    The combination of communication work and research departments can not only obtain news materials or clues from research departments, but research departments can also obtain materials from manuscripts.
    3. Before the newspaper editorial department makes an editorial plan, a reporting plan should be issued first so that the vast number of correspondents can accurately grasp the intentions of the editorial department. However, we have done this very poorly, so the editorial work appears passive.
    Most prefectural (municipal) committee communication officers can also formulate reporting plans for a certain period, issuing them to various counties and submitting them to the newspaper. If the newspaper has any comments, it will promptly raise them. Some county (town) committee communication officers also have reporting plans, but most have no plans.
    In addition to the plans of the communication work system, some other departments also arrange communication work according to their own systems, which will be more practical and easier to improve the quality of manuscripts. For example, the departments under the provincial government all make reporting plans on a monthly basis and submit them to the provincial government's news release section for inspection and implementation, and summarize them at the end of the month. However, the summary system is not sound. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau issued the reporting plan to the communication groups of the lower-level water conservancy departments, which was done better. The communication groups in Baoding City have regular reporting plans submitted to the municipal committee communication officer.
    4. In terms of reporting methods, it has been repeatedly proposed to combine more comprehensive and systematic comprehensive reports, typical reports on certain issues, continuous reports, and general reports in a certain period. More comprehensive reports have been made, but fewer typical continuous reports have been made, and there are still more general reports, so some reports appear to be the same.
    In addition, many places adopt the method of collective writing, which is a combination of leading cadres and general cadres, and a combination of worker-peasant cadres and intellectuals, which has good results.
    The above is the situation before May of this year. Since the Hebei Daily Editorial Department began to pilot the integration of editing, reporting, and communication in the second half of May this year, there has been no experience in this regard.

　　河北省的通讯工作
    河北日报编辑部
    下面是河北日报寄来的一个关于通讯工作的材料。这个材料有可以参考的经验，但不是发展通讯员的唯一的办法。因为河北省的通讯工作有它本身的特点，这就是，在中共十多年来全党办报的教育下所产生的通讯工作和党委工作的密切的结合。缺乏这个历史条件的报纸，如果要求立即照办，难免首先把发展通讯员的责任归给中共党委并因而放松本身的努力。对于党报来说，党委的领导是重要的，但报纸本身的努力也是同等重要的。两者必须结合起来，才能建立健全的和有效的通讯工作。关于这个问题，本刊在今后将继续选辑材料，供各地报纸参考。     
                               编者
    河北省的通讯工作，经过十余年来的发展，已经织成一面密密的大网，遍布在全省各地。有一万六千余名通讯员，通过了各种各样纵横交错的线，与河北日报联系着。全省各地较大的事情，及一般工作情况与问题，大部分能及时反映到报社。如用稿件数目来说明，据今年一二三月份统计，除各级通讯组织经过初选认为不能上报，因而留下的以外，交到报社的每月平均三千六百四十件（据唐山专区两个半月的统计，平均每月通讯员共写稿一千三百七十一件，经各县通讯干事初步选择后，每月平均交到地委通讯干事者只五百七十件；地委通讯干事再选一次，交到报社者平均每月二百七十三件。如按这样计算，报社收到的稿件只占通讯员写稿总数的五分之一；全省通讯员则每月平均共约写稿一万八千二百件。报纸采用稿件，只占报社收到稿件的百分之十五到二十），此外，各级各部门（主要是党委和政府）的工作报告，总结等材料，有很多能经常按期寄给报社。还有些人不断给报社写信报告工作情况。河北日报的《问事处》，每月平均收到一千八百多封信，副刊每月直接收到来稿二百余件，均没有计算在以上稿件数目内。
    通讯网的组织情况是这样的：
    河北日报编辑部（实行编采通合一以前）有通联科（十二人），各地、市、县、镇委宣传部都有通讯干事，是专业通讯工作者。兼职的有：省府各厅、局及各专署均有报道秘书，有的工厂设有通讯干事，唐山专区的专区级各部门均有党报干事。各县（镇）都有中心通讯组，由县级各部门负责干部及县委通讯干事组成，在本县（镇）通讯工作中起核心推动作用，一般的是由县委书记亲自领导。中心通讯组起作用的有三分之一。各地通讯员一般的都组成了通讯组，县以上是以部门为单位组成，区以下就是以区、村、工厂、学校为单位组成。
    我们把通讯员分成了三种：长期积极写稿，而且所写稿件质量较高者，报社即聘为特约记者或特约通讯员，全省共有二百七十人，其中有地委委员五人，县委委员八十八人。能够经常写稿者，地（市）委宣传部或县（镇）委宣传部即确定其为骨干通讯员，全省共一千零六十八人。有时写稿但也许很长时间不写者为普通通讯员，全省共一万六千余人。普通通讯员中，有三分之一以上是不大起作用或挂名的通讯员。
    这些通讯员，绝大部分都不是报社直接发展的，而是多年以来在《全党办报》的方针下，各级党委都把领导通讯工作当成了日常工作之一，经常进行、布置、动员、检查、总结。如今年一月份河北日报发起写稿运动时，报社的布置还没有发下，先由广播电台广播了，饶阳县委从收音机里听到以后，就立即作了研究，并在县区扩大干部会上作了布置。各级党委经常号召大家都要动手为党报写稿，普遍建立通讯小组，协助通讯工作干部经常召开通讯员座谈会。把写稿作为每个人必须做的工作，提出作完一个工作之后，一定要及时报道。要“首长负责，亲自动手”。各级党委还经常检查干部对写稿的认识，批判轻视写稿的思想，对重视通讯工作或写稿积极的人，在报纸上，会议上表扬或通报表扬。对轻视通讯工作或长期不写稿的负责干部，则提出批评甚至通报批评。政府各部门及各人民团体，也经常通过自己的组织系统布置通讯工作，把通讯工作作为下级对上级报告或总结工作的内容之一。如河北省水利局，局长亲自动手领导通讯工作，并亲自动手写稿和给别人改稿。在水利工作系统中有很健全的通讯组织。省水利局通讯组经常提出关于水利工作的报道要点，一面给报社作参考，一面作为该系统中各级通讯报道的依据。定县专区供销社和税务局，对其下级组织中的通讯员都有经常的指导。
    各地建立了通讯小组以后，报告给报社，报社即进行联络指导。通讯员一开始给报纸写稿，报社即抓住不放，初期是每稿必复每信必复，如所写稿件不能发表，就很耐心的提出具体意见，告诉他以后应怎样写，或者这篇稿怎样写就能发表。对发表了稿件的通讯员，则再予鼓励，让他继续多写。
    一九四七年进行土地改革时，遍地都是工作组，工作组里也有通讯组长或专门负责通讯报道工作的，报社即与这些人取得直接联系，各地土改情况与问题很快就能反映到报社。
    此外，初期报社出版的通讯刊物发给所有的通讯员每人一份，除通过这个刊物进行指导外，也有些鼓励作用，有些人拿到通讯刊物后就觉得再不写稿就对不起报社了。有的通讯员如隔了相当时间没有写稿，报社即写信联络，甚至连写几信，这样就又写起来。通讯员接到报社的信以后，觉得特别亲切，受到很大的鼓舞。很多人就这样和报社成了很好的朋友，如有的调动工作时就主动通知报社，甚至有的因病请假时也通知报社，说明他多少日子不能写稿。
    报社及有的专区，县，曾采用评奖模范通讯员、通讯组的办法，也有相当鼓舞作用。
    这样，大家就都公认了写稿是每个人的责任，不写稿或轻视通讯工作就是不对的。但也有些通讯员始终是挂名的，认为不做工作不行，不写稿不要紧，写稿是额外负担。
    河北省的通讯工作，就是这样发展与巩固起来的。
    到去年（一九四九年），通讯组织更加庞大了，通讯员更多了，再像以前那样每稿必复每信必复是作不到了，而且确实有相当一部分通讯员是挂名的，因此就转变了通讯联络的工作方法，并逐步建立骨干通讯员，聘请特约记者及特约通讯员，采取脱壳的办法，逐步精干通讯组织。在河北省来说，这是通讯组织由广泛发展到巩固到精干的发展规律。
    后来，报社通联科，主要是在业务上领导各地、市、县、镇委通讯干事及特约记者、特约通讯员，与县（镇）中心通讯组也有一定的联系。地委通讯干事主要是在业务上领导各县（镇）通讯干事，并与各县（镇）中心通讯组联系。骨干通讯员一部分是地（市）委通讯干事直接掌握的，一部分是县（镇）委通讯干事掌握的。地、市、县、镇委通讯干事又是报社的驻地记者，除作通联工作外，还进行重点采访。除特约记者及特约通讯员的稿件经县（镇）委审查后，即直寄报社通联科外，一般稿件都是经县委审查后，由通讯干事寄地委宣传部通讯干事。有的县（镇）委通讯干事也将稿件进行初选，认为质量太低的即直接退回，不再寄地委宣传部。地委通讯干事将来稿分为三类，较好的就原稿转交报社，不能单独发表的就综合改写后再寄报社，不能用的就退回或作为材料积累起来。
    报社通联科与各地的联络方法，除信件外，经常有电话联络，距离较远者即用长途电话。（在刚建省时，各地（市）委设有电台发稿，经常有电报联络）。特别是紧急任务到来时，如雨后抢耕抢种，通联科即昼夜用电话指挥各地组织报道，各地用电话向报社发稿。平时，也常有从百里以外送一件他们认为较好而且时间性较强的稿件来的。此外，为一个突击任务，如战时报道一个战役，去冬今春报道宁河、宝坻、蓟县、玉田重灾区的生产救灾，报社均派记者组带着电台去进行报道，电台除发记者稿件外，也发通讯员的较好的稿件。
    河北省的通讯工作，已具相当规模，通讯员数目及来稿数目是相当大的。但目前仍存在某些形式主义的偏向。广大的通讯员网没有完全建立在干部和工农群众中积极分子的基础之上（当然有相当部分还是依靠了积极分子的）。通讯组织大部浮在上层，没深入到广大群众中去。对培养工农通讯员没有引起重视，过去有些农村通讯组，而且有的成绩很好，建省以后都放弃了。入城以后，也没有积极建立工人通讯组。在过去的通讯工作中，多是着重于追求通讯员数量和稿件数量，甚至挑战竞赛，规定每人每月必须写几篇稿，（现在有些地区仍有此偏向），对质量的提高强调不足，因此许多通讯稿件还感零碎、片断、空泛、并有的存在着某种程度的盲目性和自流状态。
    提高通讯员和稿件的质量，是一个严重的任务，这必须经过长期努力才能获得逐步改进。不能急躁。在这一方面，我们曾采用了以下几个办法：
    一、对通讯组织的全面指导与重点使用相结合，抓住通讯工作中最主要的一环——主动组织稿件，出题目作文章。
    通讯组织发展到目前的状况，不可能再对每一个通讯员都抓得很紧，不可能再采取每稿必复每信必复的方法，但也不能把现有组织完全放弃，因此除了全面的一般指导外，就必须抓住重点使用。报社则抓住地、市、县、镇委通讯干事，县（镇）委中心通讯组，特约记者及特约通讯员（其中很多是各级主要干部），加强对他们的联络指导，根据各地汇报材料、从稿件上看到的问题及各地特点，主动给他们出题目作文章，指定专人写，或经过他们去组织。如报社经常写信或打电话请清苑特约记者马化民（县委书记）组织专题报道，他总是很快就能写来。马化民同志领导的那个中心通讯组也很起作用，他和县长及宣传部长分工领导各部门的通讯工作，经常督促检查、具体帮助、培养通讯员。马化民同志发现那个部门的工作有改进或有问题时，就给该部门的通讯员出个题目，并告诉他怎样写，写了以后，马化民同志亲自详细修改。干部下乡时，他们也亲自指示怎样注意组织报道。
    各地（市）委通讯干事，也经常采用出题目作文章的办法，如保定地委通讯干事经过出题目以后，该专区（共辖十七县）有十二个县委书记，十三个县委宣传部部长八个县长都动手写起稿来。稿件质量即显著提高。该专区为强调提高稿件质量，还曾规定各县每月只许交稿二十件到三十五件。定县地委通讯干事出题目组织的材料，能被报纸采用百分之六十到七十。但初期地委通讯干事出题目时因对各县情况了解不够，出的题目也是千篇一律，甚至把题目油印出来发到各县。有的题目未抓住各个地区的不同重点，不适于当地情况。如通县专区曾有的县认为地委通讯干事出的题目不适当，自己另外出了一个题目，并向地委通讯干事提出：“你们出的那个题目不行，我们写一个别的可以吗？”
    遇紧急任务时，也曾不断采用出题目限时间写来的办法。
    对通讯组织的领导，也应抓住重点，使用骨干。如今年一二月份写稿运动的初期，定县专区多数县份都是大平面的领导，因而稿件质量很低；博野县一个月写稿一百四十六件，报纸只采用了三件。后来地委宣传部提出通讯组织上的“精兵简政”，贯彻省宣传会议上提出的每县保持五个到十个骨干通讯员，二十个普通通讯员，一二个特约通讯员或特约记者；各县即依此进行了整顿，稿件质量逐渐提高。唐山专区卢龙、乐亭、遵化等县，始终重视培养骨干，因此通讯工作就能持续，稿件质量也较好。
    二、通讯工作与各级领导相结合，与各级领导机关的研究部门相结合，并强调负责干部动手写稿。
    中共河北省委真正把报纸当成了领导工作的重要工具，对报纸工作抓的很紧，多方面给以方便，经常主动告诉报社在一定时期应当抓住那几个主要问题进行报道。报社也经常根据省委意图提出报道要点，或先提出具体意见请示省委。地、县委通讯工作干部也经常采用这样的方法。如天津地委通讯干事，准备出较成熟的意见后，有计划有目的地去请示地委。通讯干事获得一堆材料时，就找地委请示原则，根据地委提出的原则，结合自己掌握的具体材料、典型事例，即写成综合报道。有时通讯干事写成一篇稿件交地委或专员去审查，负责同志即提高到原则上去认识这个材料，让通讯干事重新整理。通讯干事从各地来稿中发现重要问题时，因比研究室的情况还来的快，就马上汇报给地委，作为领导工作的依据。地委真正体验到了通讯报道对工作的好处，就更加重视起来，每逢工作进行到一个段落时，地委就提出问题，或列出提纲，交通讯干事去充实具体材料，写成报道。天津专署张子善专员曾说：“发动主要干部写稿，可以克服很多官僚主义，因为不调查就写不出报道，有的材料本来看着可以，但一写成稿就觉得空洞了，必须再去调查。”他还曾利用坐火车的空隙时间写稿。
    再如文安县委，把每个时期的中心工作与通讯工作看成是一个东西，通过报道使工作得到很大帮助。如通讯干事发现该县三区忽视轻灾区的生产领导，县委书记即带领通讯干事去进行检查；把这个材料写成报道。报上发表以后，县委思想上对这个问题的认识就更明确而肯定了，于是又发动各部门干部到各区进行普遍检查。县委体验到通讯报道的重要，就把这个工作作为日常指导的内容之一。县委书记经常帮助通讯干事研究题目，指定专人写稿。他还曾在干部会议上提出，能写出好的报道的部门，工作就一定深入。县委还通过报道检查工作，让县区干部每稿写两份，一交报社，一交县委。这样，干部也就很自然的把写稿看成自己的责任。
    各地（市）委的会议，一般的都让通讯干事参加，以便了解领导意图及全面工作情况。
    地委、县委及其他负责干部亲自动手写稿的很多，如天津地委七个委员都动手，蓟县县委七个委员也都动手，香河县委书记张子明两个半月亲手写稿二十一篇。但也有些负责干部还很忽视通讯工作，既不领导，也不亲自动手。有的县把能力较强的通讯干事调任其他工作。
    通讯工作与研究部门结合，不仅可从研究部门获得新闻材料或线索，研究部门也可从稿件中获得材料。
    三、报纸编辑部，在编辑计划之前，应先有报道计划发下，以使广大的通讯员能摸准编辑部的意图。但这一点我们还做得很差，因此编辑工作上表现被动。
    地（市）委通讯干事多数也能制订一定时期的报道计划，一面发到各县，一面交到报社，报社如有意见即及时提出。有的县（镇）委通讯干事也有报道计划，但多数是没有计划的。
    除了通讯工作系统的计划外，其他部门也有的按自己的系统布置通讯工作，这样会更切合实际，便于提高稿件质量。如省府所属各部门都按月订出报道计划，统一交省府新闻发布科检查执行，月底进行总结。但总结制度还不健全。省水利局把报道计划发到下边水利部门的通讯小组，作的较好。保定市的各通讯小组，都有定期的报道计划交到市委通讯干事。
    四、在报道方法上，曾反复提出要使一定时期较全面系统的综合报道，一定问题的典型报道连续报道与一般报道相结合。综合报道作的多一些，典型的连续报道则作的较少，还是一般报道多，因而有些报道显得千篇一律。
    此外，很多地方采用集体写稿的方法，一方面是领导干部与一般干部的结合，一方面是工农干部与知识分子的结合，收效还很好。
    以上是今年五月以前的情况。自今年五月下半月，河北日报编辑部开始试行编采通合一以后，在这一方面还没有经验。
