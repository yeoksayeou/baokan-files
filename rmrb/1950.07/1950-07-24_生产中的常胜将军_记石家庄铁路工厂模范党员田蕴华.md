　　The Ever-Victorious General in Production
    Remembering Tian Yunhua, Model Communist Party Member of Shijiazhuang Railway Factory

    Those who have shed blood and risked their lives for the victory of the revolution understand best how to consolidate and defend that victory. The struggle history of Communist Party member Tian Yunhua over the past dozen years is a very good illustration of this point.

    Shedding Blood, Risking Lives, Persisting in Underground Struggle

    Tian Yunhua is from Liangxiang County, Hebei Province. He is thirty-two years old this year and has been working for twenty-two years. At just ten years old, he went to work at the Matouzhen coal mine to learn how to wash boilers. At nineteen, he drifted to the Shijiazhuang Railway Machinery Factory as an apprentice. When the Anti-Japanese War began, national hatred motivated him, and he resolutely left Shijiazhuang for Zuoquan (Liaoxian), Shanxi, where he found the Communist Party, which truly led the people in resisting Japan, and joined the revolution. Under the Party's cultivation and education, his class consciousness improved, and his fighting will became even stronger. In the winter of 1937, he joined the Communist Party. From then on, Lao Tian dedicated his life to the revolutionary cause without reservation.

    In the difficult years before the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Lao Tian persisted in underground struggle in enemy-occupied areas.

    Not long after joining the revolution, he carried the task given to him by the Party, passing through the Japanese blockade to the Zhonghe Coal Mine to mobilize workers to move machinery to the liberated areas. Although a traitorous army was stationed in the mine at the time, thanks to Lao Tian's in-depth mobilization among the workers, he finally led the miners of the mine, under the cover of a regiment of the Eighth Route Army stationed in Wu'an, to dismantle and move the machinery to the liberated areas. In 1938, he was again sent to Jingxing to work. He cleverly explored the enemy's situation and bravely cooperated with the main forces to disrupt transportation and attack the enemy. He often disrupted transportation around the Touquan railway station, blew up enemy trains, and then led his comrades to transport the materials and food from the trains to the liberated areas to support the people's anti-Japanese forces.

    In 1939, he was sent to the Shijiazhuang Railway Machinery Factory to do underground work. Unexpectedly, a man named Li Yihua, who had worked with him in the past, had already betrayed and defected to the enemy. In order to gain merit in front of the enemy, the traitor Li Yihua reported Lao Tian to the Japanese. The Japanese drove a motorcycle and tied Lao Tian to the Japanese military police headquarters. Li Yihua's and the Japanese's shameless attempts to soften and persuade him were met with Lao Tian's stern rebuke, which infuriated them. The Japanese poured cold water and chili powder into Lao Tian three times, after which Lao Tian fainted. A person who has given his life to the revolutionary cause is fearless. No matter how cruelly the enemy tortured him, Lao Tian remained unyielding and said not a word. The traitor Li Yihua ran out of tricks and felt that he could not gain merit, but instead would get his hands bloody if he killed someone. So he hesitated in front of the enemy and found a few old workers in the factory to bail Lao Tian out.

    After coming out of the Japanese military police headquarters, Lao Tian went to the water company to manage the water pump. At this time, Lao Tian fought even more resolutely. In order to prevent the enemy from producing smoothly, he once sent someone to set fire to the oil and calcium carbide warehouses of the Railway Machinery Factory. After the fire broke out, Lao Tian turned off the main water gate of the water company. The Japanese could not find water to put out the fire and were in a panic. When they rushed over to question Lao Tian fiercely, Lao Tian had cleverly opened the water gate. But at this time, the flames were soaring into the sky and there was no way to save the situation. Lao Tian often deliberately turned up the horsepower and broke dozens of water pipes, so that the Japanese barracks could not get water. Therefore, he was often arrested and interrogated by the Japanese. In the winter of 1942, he was finally captured by the Japanese 1417th unit. After being arrested, he was brutally beaten into a daze by the Japanese with sticks. In his daze, he still remembered very clearly: it is glorious to sacrifice for the Party. In order to force a confession from him, the enemy tied him to a tree and called a dozen foreign dogs to bite him. At this time, he thought: "It doesn't matter if I die myself, the organization's secrets must not be exposed. Let the foreign dogs bite me to death, but it is absolutely impossible to get me to betray other comrades." A dozen foreign dogs rushed up and bit his legs until they were a bloody mess. The enemy stripped him of his clothes, gave him a tattered mat, locked him in a cellar, and did not give him food. However, no amount of torture could shake Lao Tian's fighting will. Soon the enemy sent him to the South Barracks. In 1943, they sent him to Japan as a laborer.

    In Nagano Prefecture, Japan, he and many captured compatriots were forced by the enemy to open mountains and collapse tunnels.... Endless hard work, endless torture, but Lao Tian was still full of fighting confidence. On the one hand, he learned the technology of opening tunnels, thinking: "I am a Communist Party member, as long as I am alive, I will learn the technology, and when I return to the motherland, I can serve the people." On the other hand, he organized and educated these compatriots enslaved by the enemy to resist the enemy's oppression and bullying.

    After the Japanese surrendered, he returned to the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory and, under the leadership of the Party, organized workers to carry out various struggles against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang until the liberation of Shijiazhuang.

    Work Hard to Produce and Defend the Fruits of Victory

    In the winter of 1947, Shijiazhuang was liberated. People who have shed blood for the people's liberation understand the meaning of liberation best. Lao Tian said to the workers: "We are liberated, and the factory has become our home. From now on, we will no longer suffer from hunger, cold, or oppression. We must defend the factory and work hard to produce." Since then, Lao Tian has once again devoted himself to the cause of production and construction with selfless enthusiasm.

    Not long after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, he bravely accepted the task of disrupting traffic on the northern section of the Pinghan Line (north of Baoding). He led a dozen workers, braving the enemy's artillery fire in the freezing cold, and completed the sabotage task at Wangdu Station in two days and two nights, returning victoriously to Shijiazhuang. At this time, he was promoted to Deputy Director of the Furnace Manufacturing Department (and later promoted to Director). In the winter of 1948, when Shijiazhuang was preparing for war, he mobilized and persuaded workers to actively participate in evacuation work. During the evacuation, he led the workers to protect the machines day and night, and called on everyone to "go wherever the machines go." In May 1949, during the rush repair of the Pinghan Road to support the southward army, once when repairing the 48-kilometer iron bridge, floodwater flowed down during a heavy rain and submerged the wind compressor; in order to rescue the machine, he braved the heavy rain, first took off his clothes and jumped into the water to retrieve the machine.

    During the production competition in May 1949, accidents occurred continuously in factories in various places. The original North China People's Government ordered factories in various places to strengthen security work. In July, the Railway Factory established a worker's militia, and Tian Yunhua became the captain of the militia. Lao Tian regarded the factory as more precious than his own life. He established a reporting system in the militia, organized a fire brigade, and made strict divisions of labor. Everyone patrolled day and night to ensure that no accidents occurred in the factory. He himself worked all day and then went to the factory at night to arrange and inspect work, often busy until two or three o'clock in the morning, sleeping in the gatehouse without even taking off his clothes. Lao Tian never hesitated to give his blood and sweat for the revolutionary cause.

    Under the leadership of Lao Tian (who also served as the secretary of the department's Party branch), the workers of the Furnace Manufacturing Department, under the Party's cultivation and education, gradually improved their political consciousness. In last year's Red May Great Production Competition, they won the "Collective Hero" award flag awarded by the factory and the labor union. Lao Tian was elected as a model worker of the entire factory, a representative of all the city's workers, and in October was elected as a model Communist Party member. Under the leadership of Lao Tian, the Furnace Manufacturing Department's Party branch had a clear task, and everyone worked together to "ensure the completion of production tasks." Every task given by the superiors was not only completed but also exceeded. At the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Political Work Conference on February 4 this year, the branch gloriously received the "Production Fortress" award flag.

    The Red Flag Follows Director Tian

    The workers of the Railway Factory all say: "Wherever Lao Tian goes, the task there can be completed." This is not an exaggeration at all. For example, the Vehicle Department has always been inactive in the first ten days of the month, not busy in the middle ten days, and only in the last ten days, when they are forced to deliver vehicles, does everyone panic. The monthly task is always barely completed. This January, when the department's work became so chaotic that it could no longer continue, Director Hu, in response to the demands of the masses, transferred Lao Tian to the factory to carry out rectification. After arriving at the Vehicle Department, Lao Tian found after research that the main problem of the department was the lack of systems and plans, and unclear responsibilities. So Lao Tian mobilized everyone to establish a certain reporting system. Every day at 6:00 pm, each foreman had to report the work situation of the day and the work plan for the next day. He also often convened foremen to hold meetings to study business. He also consulted with the workers and formulated a clear division of labor and a dedicated maintenance responsibility system. At the same time, rewards and punishments were clearly defined in the work. After a month, the deserving were rewarded, and the deserving were criticized. After the task of restoring sixty-five dead vehicles in the first phase was issued, the workers had no confidence because of the shortage of materials. Lao Tian convened a general meeting to call on everyone to overcome difficulties by using waste materials, and at the same time improved the method of estimating the work of the diverted vehicles. In the past, when dead vehicles entered the factory, they were always diverted first and then estimated for work, which had many problems. This time, when dead vehicles entered the factory, Lao Tian and the foremen, team leaders, technicians, etc. collectively estimated the work first, determined the condition of the dead vehicles and the degree of repair, and then uniformly allocated them. The workers felt that it was fair and reasonable, and they also understood the repair situation. At this time, the workers were in high spirits, and each team took the lead in proposing guarantees after the division of labor. Due to the establishment of a responsibility system, each team disassembled and unloaded the dead vehicles, and carefully checked them after repair. As a result, "reverse work" was eliminated, and the quality improved accordingly. During the vehicle repair process, Lao Tian always paid attention to the production situation and solved problems at any time when they were discovered. He discovered that the passenger car carpenters and the lower bogie group were engaged in departmentalism, and at the commendation meeting in February, he called on everyone to engage in joint labor and unite and help each other.

    Under the leadership of Lao Tian, the workers' initiative and enthusiasm were greatly brought into play. The first phase of dead vehicle restoration was overfulfilled, saving 1,301 workdays and improving the quality. The banner of victory was planted in the Vehicle Department. The workers all said: "The red flag always follows Director Tian." At the award ceremony for the summary of the first phase of work, the Vehicle Department received a bonus of 3,100 catties of millet, three boxes of soap, and five dozen towels. Lao Tian won the glorious title of "First Class Meritorious Person," while Lao Tian attributed the glory and achievements to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of the workers.

    After the Vehicle Department was rectified by Lao Tian, the problem of the Locomotive Department came again. In May, the task set for the Locomotive Department was nine locomotives, but only three were completed after half a month, and the quality was low and there was a lot of reverse work, which made everyone feel overwhelmed. At this time, the workers were brewing: "It won't work without Lao Tian." So Lao Tian was transferred to the Locomotive Department again. After arriving at the Locomotive Department, he found that the main problems of the department were: chaotic system, imprudent planning, careless inspection, and the workforce was not well organized and equipped. So he first started to adjust the organization. The original six shifts were changed to two large shifts, and each shift was divided into six groups to carry out competition-style operation methods, overcoming the shortcomings of the past, where each shift did not help each other and it was inconvenient to transfer people, and also stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm. Subsequently, the past tendency of the leadership not paying attention to the old technical workers was corrected. According to the quality of the technology, the distribution was based on the talent, so that the technology of the old technicians could be fully utilized. At the same time, the responsibilities of the foreman to inspect, supervise, and distribute work were clearly stipulated. He instructed the foremen to find good working hours, strictly check the linearity, and prepare inspection tools for the foremen to improve quality and reduce reverse work. Lao Tian was very serious and conscientious in his work, and gave timely praise when he found good things; he gave strict criticism and education when he found perfunctory work. This pragmatic style was deeply supported by the workers. After this improvement, the Locomotive Department successfully completed the task of nine locomotives at the end of May. In this way, Lao Tian became the ever-victorious general in production at the Railway Factory.

　　生产中的常胜将军
    记石家庄铁路工厂模范党员田蕴华
    石家庄文化馆美术股
    为革命的胜利流过血拚过命的人，是最懂得怎样巩固胜利保卫胜利的人。共产党员田蕴华的十几年的斗争历史，正是这个问题的一个很好的说明。
    流血拚命坚持地下斗争
    田蕴华是河北省良乡县人。今年三十二岁，已经做了二十二年的工。他刚刚十岁就到马头镇煤矿上学洗锅炉，十九岁流浪到石家庄铁路机厂做学徒。抗日战争开始，民族仇恨激励着他，使他毅然离开石家庄，到山西左权（辽县）找到了真正领导人民抗日的共产党，参加了革命。在党的培养教育下，他的阶级觉悟提高了，斗争意志更加坚强了。一九三七年冬，他参加了共产党。从此，老田就把自己的生命毫无保留地奉献给革命事业。
    在石家庄解放以前的艰苦岁月里，老田一直在敌区坚持着地下斗争。
    参加革命不久，他就带着党给他的任务，通过日寇的封锁线，到中和煤矿去发动工人往解放区搬机器。虽然当时矿上驻扎着汉奸队伍，但由于老田在工人中的深入动员，终于在驻武安八路军某团的掩护下，他带领该矿工友把机器拆卸搬到了解放区。一九三八年，他又被派到井陉去进行工作。他机智地探索敌情，勇敢地协同主力军破坏交通袭击敌人。他常常在头泉车站一带破坏了交通，炸毁了敌人的火车，然后带着同志们把车上的物资、食粮等运到解放区去支援人民的抗日部队。
    一九三九年他又被派到石家庄铁路机厂做地下工作。不料，过去和他一块工作过的一个叫做李义华的已经叛变投敌。为了在敌人面前献功，叛徒李义华把老田报告给了日寇。日寇开着摩托车把老田绑到日本宪兵队去。李义华和鬼子的无耻的软化劝诱遭到老田的严词斥责后，他们恼羞成怒了。日寇把老田灌了三次凉水和辣椒面后，老田昏过去了。已经把生命交给革命事业的人是无所畏惧的，不管敌人怎样严刑拷打，老田至死不屈、一字不说。叛徒李义华技穷了，感到献功不成，反而杀人落个两手血，于是在敌人面前支吾了一下，找了工厂里几个老工友把老田保出去了。
    从日本宪兵队出来后，老田又到自来水公司管水泵。这时老田斗争得更坚决了。为了让敌人不能顺利生产，有一次他派人把铁路机厂的石油、电石仓库放了火。火起后，老田又把自来水公司的总水门关了。鬼子们找不到水救火，急得乱成一团。当他们狠狠地跑来质问老田时，老田已经机智地把水门打开了。但这时已是火焰冲天无法挽救了。老田又常常故意把马力开足蹩坏几拾根水管子，使得日本兵营吃不上水。因此，他常被日寇抓去审问。一九四二年冬，他终于又被日寇的一四一七部队捕去。被捕后，他被日寇用棒子毒打得昏昏迷迷。在昏迷中他仍很清醒地记着：为党牺牲是光荣的。为了要从他口里逼问口供，敌人把他绑在树上叫来十几只洋狗咬他。这时候，他想着：“我自己死了没关系，组织秘密可不能暴露。叫洋狗咬死就咬死吧，叫我供出其他同志来，那是绝对不能的。”十几只洋狗扑上前来把他的两腿咬得血肉模糊。敌人把他的衣服剥光，给了他一领破席子，把他关在地窑里，饭也不给他吃。但是，不管什么样的折磨也动摇不了老田的战斗意志。不久敌人把他送到南兵营去。一九四三年又把他弄到日本做劳工去。
    在日本长野县，他和许多被抓去的同胞被敌人逼迫着开山、崩坠道……。做不完的苦工，受不尽的折磨，而老田仍是满怀战斗信心。他一面学开坠道的技术，想着：“我是一个共产党员，只要活着，把技术学会，回到祖国去的时候就能为人民服务。”一面组织教育这些被敌人奴役的同胞反抗敌人的压迫欺凌。
    日寇投降后，他重新回到石家庄铁路工厂，在党的领导下，组织工人同蒋介石匪帮进行各种斗争，直到石家庄解放。
    努力生产保卫胜利果实
    一九四七年冬，石家庄解放了。为着人民的解放流过血的人是最懂得解放的意义的。老田向工友们说：“咱们解放了，工厂成了咱们的家。从此，咱们再也不忍饥挨饿受压迫了。咱们要保卫工厂努力生产。”从此，老田又以忘我的热情，全心全意为生产建设事业而奋斗。
    石家庄解放不久，他勇敢地接受了到平汉线北段（保定北）去破坏交通的任务，他率领着十几名工友，冰天雪地中冒着敌人的炮火，在望都车站两天两夜突击完成了破坏任务，胜利返回石家庄。这时他被提升为制炉所副主任（后又提升为主任）。一九四八年冬，石家庄备战时，他动员说服工人踊跃参加疏散工作。在疏散途中，他带着工友日夜保护机器，并号召大家“机器到那里，咱们就到那里。”一九四九年五月，抢修平汉路，支援南下大军，有一次在修四十八公里铁桥时，大雨中洪水流下来把风力压缩机淹了；为了抢救机器，他冒着大雨，首先脱了衣服跳到水里捞机器。
    一九四九年五月生产竞赛中，各地工厂不断发生事故，原华北人民政府命令各地工厂加强保卫工作。七月铁路工厂成立职工纠察队，田蕴华当了纠察大队长，老田把工厂看得比自己的生命更宝贵，他在纠察队里建立了汇报制度，组织了消防队，进行了严密分工，大家日夜巡查，保证工厂不出事故，他自己白天工作一天，夜晚还要到工厂布置检查工作，常常忙到半夜两三点钟，衣服也不脱就睡在门房里。为革命事业而辛勤工作，老田是从不吝惜自己的血汗的。
    在老田（兼该所支部书记）领导下的制炉所的工友们，在党的培养教育下，政治觉悟日渐提高，去年红五月大生产竞赛中，他们荣获厂部和分工会奖给的“集体英雄”奖旗。老田被选为全厂劳动模范，全市职工代表，十月又被选为模范共产党员。制炉所支部在老田领导下，任务明确，大家一致为“保证生产任务的完成”而努力。每次上级给的任务，不但完成并且超过。在今年二月四日太原铁路局政治工作会议上，支部光荣地得到“生产堡垒”的奖旗。
    红旗跟着田主任
    铁路工厂的工人们都说：“老田到那里，那里的任务就能完成。”这话讲得一点也不夸张。比如车辆所吧，一向是上旬不动，中旬不忙，下旬逼着要出车时，大家才都着了慌。每月的任务总是勉勉强强的才能完成。今年一月，所里的工作紊乱得不能再继续下去的时候，胡厂长顺应群众的要求调老田到该厂去进行整顿。老田到车辆所后，经过研究发现该所的主要毛病在于工作缺乏制度和计划，责任不分明。于是老田就发动大家建立一定的汇报制度，每天下午六时，各工长要将当天工作情况和次日的工作计划汇报出来。并经常召集工长开会研究业务。他又和工友们商量制订了明确分工和专修负责的打印记制。同时工作中奖惩分明，一月下来，该奖励的奖励，该批评的批评。第一期复活死车六十五辆的任务下来后，因为材料困难，工友们都没有信心。老田一面召开大会，号召大家利用废料克服困难，一面改进分车估工办法。过去死车进厂，总是先分车后估工，其中毛病很大。这次死车进厂，老田同各工长、组长、技术员等先集体估工，确定死车状况和修理程度，而后统一分配。工友们都觉得公平合理，同时也了解了修理状况。这时工友们情绪很高，分工后各组争先提出保证。由于建立责任制，各组都把死车大拆大卸，修完后又认真检查，结果“反手活”消灭了，质量随之提高。在车辆修理过程中，老田时时注意生产情况，发现问题随时解决。他发现了客车木匠与下部台车组闹本位主义，在二月份的庆功大会上就号召大家联合劳动，团结互助。
    在老田的领导下，工友们的主动性和积极性大大发挥，第一期死车复活超额完成，节省一千三百零一个工，还提高了质量。胜利的红旗插在了车辆所。工友们都说：“红旗总是跟着田主任跑。”在第一期工作总结的发奖大会上，车辆所得到奖金小米三千一百斤、肥皂三箱、手巾五打。老田赢得了“一等功臣”的光荣称号，而老田则把光荣和成绩归功于党的正确领导和工友们的努力。
    车辆所被老田整顿好了，机车所的问题又来了。五月份机车所部定的任务是九辆机车，但是半个月过去只完成了三辆，而且质量低、反手活多，大家被压得喘不过气来。这时工友们就酝酿着：“非老田来不行。”于是老田又被调到了机车所。他到机车所后，发现该所主要问题是：制度紊乱、计划不周密、检查不认真、劳动力没有很好组织配备。于是他首先着手调整组织。把原来的六个班改为两大班，每班下分六个组，以班为单位进行竞赛式的作业方法，克服了过去各班互不帮助、调人不便的缺点，又激发了工友们的生产积极性。随后又纠正了过去领导上不重视老技术工友的偏向，根据技术优劣，量才分配，使老技工的技术得以充分发挥。同时明确规定了工长检查、督促、分配工作的职责，他责成工长找好工时，严格检查线度，并给工长预备下检查工具等，以提高质量减少反手活。老田在工作中十分严肃认真，发现好的及时给予表扬；发现工作敷衍的则给予严格的批评教育。这种实事求是的作风深受工友们的拥护。经过这番改进，五月底机车所胜利完成九辆机车的任务。就这样老田成为铁路工厂生产中的常胜将军。
