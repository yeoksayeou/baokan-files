　　Regarding Enrollment Matters at the Beijing Journalism School
    Answering Readers' Questions
    To the Editor: We have received letters from readers inquiring about enrollment matters at our school. Our reply is as follows:

    The Beijing Journalism School is a journalism school directly under the leadership of the Press Administration of the Central People's Government. Fan Changjiang, Deputy Director of the Press Administration, concurrently serves as the school's principal, and Chen Hanbo serves as the vice-principal. The school was formerly the Xinhua News Agency's news training class. The task of the school is to meet the needs of New China's cultural construction and to systematically cultivate talent in interviewing, editing, translating, and researching materials for the people's news undertakings. The first term of the school concluded in early May of this year, and the 270 graduates have been assigned to work in news organizations across the country. The second term of the school will implement a more standardized education than the first term. The duration of study for the second term has been changed to one year (the first term was half a year), and two types of classes will be established simultaneously: research classes and regular classes. Students in the research classes will be selected by the major administrative region governments from among the working news staff in public and private news organizations under their jurisdiction. Students in the regular classes will be recruited through examinations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou (the enrollment notice for the regular classes in the Beijing area appeared in the People's Daily from June 26th to 30th).

    Furthermore, in response to requests from out-of-town candidates, the registration deadline for the Beijing area has been extended to the 7th of this month.
