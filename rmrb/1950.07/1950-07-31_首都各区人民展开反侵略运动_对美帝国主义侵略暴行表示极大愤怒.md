People in All Districts of the Capital Launch Anti-Aggression Movement
Expressing Great Anger at the US Imperialist Aggression

[Reported by this newspaper] The people in all districts of the capital have enthusiastically launched a movement against the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea, expressing great anger at the aggressive atrocities of US imperialism.

The Second District Launched a Letter-Writing Campaign to Support the Heroic Korean People

Representatives of the Preparatory Committee of the People's Representative Conference of the Second District issued a written statement on behalf of the 150,000 people of the Second District, warmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and resolutely demanding the liberation of Taiwan and opposing the aggression of the US war-mongers. Workers, women, and members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the Second District jointly launched a letter-writing campaign. Each person wrote a short letter to the Korean People's Army and the broad masses of the Korean people, supporting their just war. The Third Cultural Center cut out cartoons from newspapers and put them on display. More than 300 workers of the Second District Engineering Team held a parade on July 24th. Branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, adult night schools, and housewives held forums to oppose the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Everyone recognized that US imperialism is not to be feared, but is a paper tiger that appears strong but is weak inside. Taiwan and Korea will surely be liberated. Final victory belongs to the people of the world. (Preparatory Committee of the People's Representative Conference of the Second District, Chen Yingnan)

The Fourth District Mobilized Propaganda Teams to Deeply Carry Out Peace Signatures

After the establishment of the Fourth District People's Committee Against US Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea on the 20th, it used various methods such as blackboard newspapers, radio stations, street propaganda, forums, and night school classes to publicize to the masses.

Eight propaganda teams were formed throughout the district and were dispatched to the streets for publicity on the afternoon of the 23rd. The Bureau of Weights and Measures had a waist drum team, Huabei Middle School had waist drums and living newspaper plays, Beijing Normal University had a song and dance performance "The People of Taiwan Stand Up," and Jinghua, Hengdecheng and other factories had yangko dances. Wherever these teams went, crowds of people gathered, some as many as 600 people. A road repair worker was happy after seeing the Korean map carried by the propaganda team and listening to the explanation. He said, "Look how fast the Korean People's Army is fighting. The reactionary foothold isn't much. Finally, they can only roll into the sea!" The Jinghua Rubber Factory worker propaganda team carried a portrait of General Kim Il-sung, and many people surrounded them to watch, with looks of admiration on their faces. Each propaganda team carried a peace signature book, and many citizens signed the peace signature book. A housewife said: "US imperialism is really unreasonable! He wants to manage the Korean people's housework. We must oppose it!" On the 24th, the workers of Housheng Match Factory also held a forum. (Xu Hanxiang, Lu Zhui)

The Fifth District Conveys the Work of the District Representative Conference in Conjunction with Propaganda Against US Aggression

The representatives of the Fifth District who participated in the People's Representative Conference of the District carried out propaganda against the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea while conveying the work of the District Representative Conference. The masses expressed great anger at the US imperialist armed intervention in Taiwan and Korea, and at the same time had a fairly clear view of the essence of US imperialism. For example, housewife Shen Ruizhi said: "US imperialism is a 'tiger brand', it looks fierce on the surface, but it is actually not strong, all young master soldiers." Everyone believes that the People's Liberation Army will surely liberate Taiwan, and the Korean people will surely win. A nursery in the district took the recent political classes as a theme to oppose the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and conducted discussions. Work and study were also centered on this topic in their spare time. (Liu Zhongze, Chen Yingnan)

The Sixth District Enthusiastically Launches Peace Signatures to Answer the US Armed Aggression

The people of all walks of life in the Sixth District use an enthusiastic peace signature movement to respond to the US imperialist open armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea. At the mobilization meeting for signatures, many people voluntarily requested to speak on stage, expressing their determination to defend peace. An old lady Yang from the Fifth Police Station of Outer Second said: "We ate mixed noodles during the Japanese devils' rule, and we couldn't even eat mixed noodles when the Kuomintang came, but it has only been a little over a year since the Communist Party peacefully liberated Beijing, and even rickshaw workers are eating white noodles. We are determined to defend peace. It is impossible for imperialism to want us to eat mixed noodles again!" According to incomplete statistics, the number of signatures in the district has reached more than 90,000, nearly two-thirds of the district's population. Among them, more than 40,000 people have signed in the past ten days. (Ge Xing)

Paper Tiger Breaks with One Poke - People in the Eighth District Denounce US Aggression

More than 3,000 people from all walks of life in the Eighth District gathered on July 26 to oppose the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The representatives spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their opposition to US aggression, supporting the Korean people, and reiterating their firm will to liberate Taiwan. Li Zhirong, a female worker from Huaxing, said: "The Korean People's Army quickly defeated the US imperialist army. This proves that US imperialism is nothing great, just a paper tiger, which breaks with one poke! Our working class unites with the peace-loving people of the world to stop the war of aggression and strive for peace. If the US dares to launch a war, it will go to its doom faster!" She called on all workers to step up production, support the liberation of Taiwan, eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and consolidate victory. An emotional working woman angrily said: "Taiwan belongs to our China, and liberating Taiwan is our own business. The United States lives on the other side of the sea. What does he want to manage?! The Korean people are seeking liberation, and what is wrong with the United States?! They actually sent naval, land and air forces to massacre the Korean people. It's really shameless! This kind of behavior is openly harming our Chinese people, harming the Korean people, and harming the entire Asian people. We are not afraid of it, we have a lot of strength! All the people of the world stand with the Soviet Union to oppose these mad dogs who massacre the people. Let's unite and send them back!" (Jia Te)

Imperialism Is Not Scary! People in the Nineteenth District Have Increased Confidence in Victory

The movement against US aggression against Taiwan and Korea has been enthusiastically launched in the Nineteenth District. The masses have greatly increased their confidence in defending world peace and liberating Taiwan after hearing about the embarrassing situation of the US imperialist defeat in Korea. After the news of the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea spread in Lugucun, farmers discussed it when they were relaxing in the evening. Some said: "In the past, the reactionaries always thought that with the help of the old American, they had a backer to oppress the people; but now the old American is so weak in Korea!" Some said: "As long as the people of the world unite and fight resolutely like our Chinese and Korean people, imperialism is nothing to be afraid of." (Zhou Jican)
