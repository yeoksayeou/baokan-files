    The meeting decided to adhere to the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," with the representatives from all sectors returning to the masses they represent to deeply convey the spirit of this District People's Representative Conference, and the two main resolutions of this conference—organizing a Housing Repair Committee and establishing a health pact—as well as other related proposals passed by this conference. In addition, the District Culture and Education Section will invite district representatives to conduct communication and explanation in adult night schools.

    Regarding the organization of the Housing Repair Committee, it was decided that District Head Su Jie, street resident representative Bai Wenzhen, and specially invited representative Yang Zhushan would be responsible for drafting the committee's rules of procedure and other preparatory work.
