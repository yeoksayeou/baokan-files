　　North China Agricultural Science Institute Establishes Livestock Artificial Insemination Training Class

    [Report from this newspaper] In response to the government's call to vigorously restore draught animals, the Animal Husbandry Department of the North China Agricultural Science Institute recently established a livestock artificial insemination training class. The first session began on the 10th of last month, with formal classes starting on the 12th.

    The trainees participating in this session are all senior cadres transferred from local animal husbandry agencies, including: three from the Beijing suburbs, six from Shanxi Province, four each from Chahar and Suiyuan, five from Hebei, and two from Pingyuan, totaling twenty-four people. The class plans to train one group each month. After graduation, the trainees will return to their work areas and establish their own training classes, so that a large number of technical personnel related to livestock artificial insemination can be created in a short period of time.

    This livestock artificial insemination is the most advanced method for increasing the number of superior breeding stock. At the same time, it can prevent various infectious diseases during natural mating. Before holding the training class, the department sent artificial insemination experts Zheng Piliu and Yan Yan to participate in the artificial insemination training class at the Tie Ling stud farm in Northeast China in March of this year, where they served as instructors. Later, they organized a Northeast work group, led by Zhang Songyin, the head of the department. They participated in the teaching work of the Nongan artificial insemination training class and participated in the actual artificial insemination work of various breeding stations in the Northeast, gaining a lot of experience.

    The course includes political reports and special lectures. The internship adopts a group rotation system, so that each trainee can master the operation proficiently. In addition, the working methods for running livestock artificial insemination training classes in various regions are also one of the main courses of this session.

　　华北农业科学研究所成立家畜人工授精训练班
    【本报讯】华北农业科学研究所畜牧系为响应政府大力恢复耕畜的号召，最近成立家畜人工授精训练班。第一期已于上月十日开学，十二日开始正式上课。
    本期参加学习的学员，均系各地畜牧机关调训的高级干部，计：北京郊区三人，山西省六人，察哈尔绥远各四人，河北五人，平原二人，共二十四人。该班预计每月训练一批，学员毕业后回到自己的工作地区，再分别成立训练班，使在短期内可造成大批有关家畜人工授精的技术人员。
    此项家畜人工授精是增殖优良种畜最进步的方法。同时可以防止自然交配时的各种传染病。该系于举办训练班前，曾于本年三月间派人工授精专家郑丕留。严炎二人参加东北铁岭种马场的人工授精训练班担任教课工作，其后又组织东北工作组，由该系系主任张松荫领导。参加农安人工授精训练班的教学工作，并参加东北各配种站的实际人工授精工作，吸取了很多的经验。
    该班课程包括政治报告和专题讲演。实习采取分组轮换制，使每一学员均能熟练操作。此外，关于开办各地区家畜人工授精训练班的工作方法，亦为本期的主要课程之一。
