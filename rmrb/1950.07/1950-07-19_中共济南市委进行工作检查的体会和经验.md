　　The correct organization of the examination of execution is of decisive significance in the struggle against bureaucracy and formalism. Are the resolutions of the leading organs being implemented, or are they being shelved by bureaucrats and formalists? Are these resolutions being correctly implemented or are they being misinterpreted? Is the agency working sincerely and with Bolshevik spirit, or is it idling? -- All this can only be known in time after a good review of the implementation. A good review of the execution is a searchlight that helps us to find out the state of the work of the organs at any time and expose the true colors of bureaucrats and formalists. It can be said with certainty that nine out of ten failures and flaws are due to the failure to properly organize the work of reviewing the implementation. There is no doubt that if there was such a review of implementation, then failures and flaws would certainly have been prevented in advance.

            Preliminary Preparations
    In order to summarize the production work of the first half of 1950, and to promote and deploy the production and mass work for the second half of the year, the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in conjunction with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation, organized a unified force in June to focus on inspecting the production work and party-mass relations of state-owned factories.
    The focus of this production work inspection was mainly on the production in March, April, and May, democratic management, and the role and status of the factory's Party branch, trade union, and Communist Youth League in production and enterprise management. The factories inspected were the Second Factory and Third Factory of the Industrial Bureau, the Automobile Parts Factory of the Highway Transportation Bureau, the Huaxing Paper Mill of the Production Department, and the Jinan Chemical Factory, totaling five. The inspection team was composed of more than twenty core members drawn from various departments of the Municipal Committee and units such as the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation, divided into four groups, with the directors or section chiefs of the Municipal Committee or the trade union serving as the group leaders. The Municipal Committee Office was responsible for overall coordination. The inspection work lasted for a total of ten days (June 3rd to 13th). Before going to the factories, in order to make each member participating in the inspection work understand the intention, focus, and requirements of the inspection work, the following preparations were made:
    1. Studied the Municipal Committee's instructions on the production work of state-owned enterprises in 1950, the resolutions of the Second Municipal Workers' Congress, and the enterprise leadership's arrangements and requirements for the production tasks of the factories to be inspected.
    2. Reviewed the past and present work reports of each factory.
    3. The Municipal Committee Office, in coordination with the group leaders, contacted and discussed with the Industrial Bureau, Highway Transportation Bureau, and Production Department to jointly study and understand the situation of each factory, aiming to concentrate efforts and facilitate the inspection work together with the enterprise administration, Party committee, and trade union.
            Methods of Inspection Work
    The method of inspection work is generally as follows: After the inspection team enters the factory, it first explains its intention to the factory's leadership and all employees, and then conducts inspection and understanding through the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the factory, combining the inspection work with the factory's own review and summary. Various small-scale symposiums are also used, such as technician symposiums and skilled worker symposiums, to gain a broader and deeper understanding of specialized issues and listen to the masses' opinions on production management and leadership. The production in May and the current production are taken as the center and starting point to understand the problems existing in production and other work, and to link it with the work situation in the previous months. During the inspection process, the factory's Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League generally provided strong assistance and gave many conveniences to the inspection workers. The broad masses of employees placed great concern and hope in the work team, and frankly and responsibly provided many valuable materials and opinions. Before the inspection team arrived at the rubber workshop of the Automobile Parts Factory, the workers of the workshop took the initiative to contact the inspection team, requesting the inspection team to go to their workshop to understand the situation. The inspection team held a symposium to understand the situation in the workshop. Out of the 32 workers in the workshop, 27 attended the meeting except for those on duty, and each person spoke, with a total of 61 speeches. The workers who were unable to attend the meeting also submitted written opinions. In addition, the workers of the entire workshop put forward a total of 167 opinions. These opinions not only included criticisms but also positive suggestions on improving party-mass relations, improving production management, and implementing democratic management. After the inspection, the materials were sorted out and analyzed by groups to unify understanding. Before leaving the factory, the inspection team reported the inspection work to the factory's Party and Management Committee and listened to the opinions of the factory's responsible comrades, and then reported to the Municipal Committee and the Federation of Trade Unions in a systematic way. During the inspection process, each group leader contacted the Municipal Committee Office every three days, mainly to report on the progress of the work and the difficulties encountered, so that problems could be discussed and dealt with in a timely manner.
            Some Experiences and Lessons
    From this production work inspection, we have the following experiences and lessons:
    (1) The departments of the Municipal Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League not only need to organize forces to go to factories to understand and help with work on a regular basis or find people to report the situation to the organs; during a certain period, the municipal-level leading organs must take the Municipal Committee and the Federation of Trade Unions as the center, and organize unified forces to conduct systematic and in-depth inspection and summary of the production and party-mass work in state-owned enterprises with a focus while taking into account the overall situation. Because after unified and coordinated arrangements are made, organizing unified and effective inspections on a regular basis is an extremely important opportunity to do a good job; this can also enable departments to understand each other in their work and become more consistent in their thinking, and some conservative states of working separately and shutting themselves off will naturally be broken. This inspection of the production work of the five factories fully proves this point.
    (2) The characteristic of this inspection work is not only reflected in the unity and consistency of the various leading organs and departments, but more importantly, the combination of leadership and being led, and the combination of inspection and the factory's own review and summary. For example, the Industrial Bureau's administrative and Party committees attached great importance to this inspection of the Industrial Bureau's Second and Third Factories. The Party committee held a meeting for this purpose, studied the organization and conduct of the inspection work, made a decision on the inspection work, and organized the backbone of the Party committee and the trade union to go to the Second and Third Factories to cooperate with the inspection. The director and the Party secretary also personally participated in this work. After the inspection team arrived at the factory, it first understood the situation from top to bottom through the administration, branch, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and then held various symposiums, earnestly carried out criticism and self-criticism, forming a mass inspection upsurge. Therefore, the situation understood by the inspection team was more accurate, and the crux of the problem was also easier to find. After the inspection, the work of each factory improved and increased to varying degrees in June.
    (3) This inspection work tells us that inspection work must have a focus, and it must start from the actual situation and production of the factory being inspected in order to easily grasp the key and solve the problem. Conversely, a comprehensive inspection and understanding is likely to be general and vague, and cannot grasp the key issues of the factory.
    (4) In the inspection work, the inspectors must first focus on the new and good things in production and management, especially in the current situation where there is a lack of experience in industrial production. On the one hand, they should study the difficulties in the situation of production and management; on the other hand, they should seriously face the morbidity and crux of production. In particular, those who clearly do not understand but pretend to understand, are complacent, narrow-minded, do not care about state property, do not listen to the opinions of the masses, and whose subjective conditions are available, but the work can be done well but has not been done well, or do not go to do well, should be given serious criticism to help them improve and raise.
    (5) The main purpose of the work inspection is to check the situation and current situation of the organization's implementation based on the original plan, find out the resistance and crux that hinders progress and the root causes of their occurrence, and point out the solutions. Problems that can be solved at that time should be solved as much as possible, or handed over to the factory leadership to start solving them. But some problems are temporarily impossible to solve, then wait for later to solve them. For example, in addition to the serious shortcomings in the management and operation of the Automobile Parts Factory and the Chemical Factory themselves (which is the main reason), there are many difficulties in the market sales. Even if the technical conditions are improved, the management work is improved, and the leadership style is transformed, there is actually a process to completely improve production and operation. The situation encountered in this inspection work is that the broad masses of workers are eager to solve all the problems in the management and operation of these enterprises as soon as possible; while some factory leaders are indifferent to these problems, or rely on waiting, instead of relying on the masses and creating conditions to improve the current situation of enterprise management and operation as soon as possible. All these subjective and artificial shortcomings and errors in production and enterprise management are not allowed to continue to exist for a long time.
    (6) From this work inspection and the usual understanding, it can be clearly seen that although there has been a new beginning in the improvement of the production and management and operation of some enterprises in Jinan, there are still many factories where the administrative management is very bad, blind production, and there are serious waste and destruction phenomena. In the implementation of the policy of democratic management of factories, a few factories are better, but most factories are still doing very poorly. Many factories still have vague or even confrontational ideas about the policy of democratic management of factories. They give orders in their work, suppress democracy, and do not pay attention to the suggestions and requirements of workers. The trade unions of some large factories have begun to focus their main work on launching and organizing production competitions and developing rationalization proposals. However, many factory trade unions are still undemocratic in leadership; their tasks are unclear; and education work is very weak. The Party also lacks leadership and support for the trade unions. The Party's work in factories generally stays in the circle of daily affairs, not knowing what to do, not knowing how to guarantee and supervise production. Some factory Party organizations still have some confusion, and their concern for production is still very poor, and their concern and research for the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League and the vital interests of the masses is not enough, and they have failed to form a core of ideological and political leadership in a factory enterprise. On the whole, in the production and management and operation of state-owned enterprises, a new atmosphere is rising, but progress is very slow, and there are still many serious problems that need to be solved urgently. The main link to solving these problems is the concentration of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League on leading production and implementing the issue of democratic management of factories. And the key to implementing this policy is the issue of the ideological style of leading cadres and the issue of the core leadership role of the Party.
    Finally, we deeply realize that timely work inspection, grasping the key points, drawing lessons, and promoting the overall situation are important keys to changing the style and improving leadership. This work inspection has played a great role in helping the Municipal Committee leadership get rid of clericalism, change its style, and improve the policy level of cadres. In the future, we should firmly grasp this point, and earnestly study and implement the Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, and do our work well.

　　中共济南市委进行工作检查的体会和经验
    中共济南市委秘书长  张骏
    正确组织执行情形的审查这件事情，在与官僚主义及文牍主义作斗争的事业上，具有决定的意义。领导机关的决议是否执行，或者被官僚主义者和文牍主义者置诸高阁？这些决议是否正确执行或者被人曲解？机关是否诚恳地并用布尔塞维克的精神来工作，或者是在那里空转？——关于这一切，只有好好地审查了执行情形以后，才能及时知道。好好地审查执行情形——这是这样的探照灯，它帮助我们随时查明机关工作的状况并揭露官僚主义者和文牍主义者的原形。可以确信地说：十分之九的失败和破绽，是由于没有正确组织执行情形的审查工作。无疑义的，如果有了这样一种执行情形的审查，那末，失败和破绽就一定事先被防止了。
                        斯大林在《联共十七次代表大会上的报告》
            事先的准备工作
    为了总结一九五○年上半年的生产工作，借以推动与部署下半年的生产和党群工作，中共济南市委于六月份协同市总工会、青年团、妇联统一组织力量，有重点地检查了公营工厂的生产工作和党群关系。
    这次生产工作检查的重点，主要是三、四、五月份的生产，民主管理，以及工厂党的支部、工会、青年团在生产与企业管理中的作用、地位等。检查的工厂有工业局的二厂、三厂，公路运输局的汽车零件制造厂，生产部的华兴纸厂和济南化工厂等五个。检查组的组织是由市委的各部门和工、青、妇等单位抽调的二十几个骨干组成，分四个组，由市委或工会的部长、科长任组长。总的方面则由市委办公室负责主持进行。检查工作前后共历时十天（六月三日至十三日）。在未去工厂之前，为了使参加检查工作的每一成员了解检查工作的意图、重点和要求，曾进行了如下的准备工作：
    一、研究了市委关于一九五○年公营企业生产工作指示、市总工会二次工代会议决议、和企业领导机关对所要进行检查的各厂生产任务的布置与要求。
    二、审阅了各厂过去与现在的工作报告。
    三、市委办公室协同各组长分别去工业局、公路运输局、生产部接洽商讨，共同研究了解各厂情况，目的在于力求同企业行政、党委、工会一道检查工厂工作；这样可以集中力量，便于检查工作。
            检查工作的方法
    检查工作的方法，一般是：检查组进厂后首先向该厂领导方面与全体职工说明来意，继而通过该厂的党、政、工、团的组织进行检查了解，使检查工作与本厂的检讨总结相结合。并辅以各种小型座谈会，如技工座谈会，熟练工人座谈会等，借以较广泛深入的了解专门性问题，听取群众对生产管理及领导的意见。以五月份及目前进行着的生产为重心和起点去了解生产中所存在的问题以及其他各种工作，并联系以往几个月的工作情况。检查过程中，工厂党、政、工、团一般都大力协助，给检查工作者很多方便。广大职工对工作组寄以莫大的关切与热望，坦率而又负责的提供了许多宝贵的材料与意见。汽车零件制造厂橡胶场工人在检查组尚未到该场之前，便主动和检查组接洽，请求检查组去他们场了解情况。检查组在该场举行了了解情况座谈会，全场三十二个工人中除勤务外，到会二十七个人，每人均发了言，发言共达六十一次之多，未得参加会的工人还提出了书面意见。另外全场工人提出共一百六十七条意见。这些意见不光是批评，同时有积极的有关改善党群关系、改进生产管理、实行管理民主化等方面的建议。检查完毕，以小组为单位整理材料，研究分析，统一认识之后，离厂前向工厂党与管委会汇报检查工作情形，听取厂的负责同志的意见，而后向市委与总工会作系统的汇报。检查工作过程中，各组长每三天向市委办公室联系一次，主要是反映工作进度与工作困难等，以便问题得以及时商讨处理。
            几点体会和经验
    从这次生产工作检查中，我们有以下几点体会和经验：
    （一）市委各部门、市工会、团市委，不仅需要在平时分别组织力量经常去工厂了解与帮助工作，或找人来机关汇报情况；在一定期间，市级领导机关必须以市委与总工会为中心，统一组织力量，有重点而又照顾全面的对公营企业中的生产和党群工作进行系统深入的检查与总结。因为在统一协同布置工作之后，定期的组织统一有效的检查，就是搞好工作的一个极为重要的契机；这样也可使部门间彼此在工作上相互了解，在思想上更加一致，某些各自为政，闭关自守的保守状态也自然会被打破。这次五个厂的生产工作检查，就充分证明了这一点。
    （二）这次检查工作的特点，不仅表现在各领导机关部门的协同一致，更重要的是领导与被领导相结合，检查与工厂本身的检讨总结相结合。例如这次检查工业局的二、三厂，工业局的行政和党委会都很重视。党委会曾为此召开会议，研究检查工作的组织进行，作出了检查工作的决定，并组织党委会与工会的骨干一同去二、三厂配合检查。局长同党委书记也亲自参加这一工作。检查组到工厂后首先自上而下的通过行政、支部、工会、青年团了解情况，继而召开各种不同的座谈会，认真展开批评与自我批评，形成了一种群众性的检查热潮。因此，检查组所了解的情况是较为准确，问题的症结也易于找到。检查后各厂工作在六月份都有了些大小不同的改进与提高。
    （三）这次检查工作告诉了我们，检查工作必须有重点，而又必须从被检查工厂的现实情况和生产出发才易于抓住要害，解决问题。相反地，面面周到的检查了解，其结果容易是空泛一般，抓不住工厂问题的关键。
    （四）检查工作中，检查者必需首先着眼生产与管理中新生的好的东西，特别在目前工业生产上缺乏经验的情况下，更应注意这一点。一方面设身处地的研究生产与管理的处境困难；另一方面严肃的正视生产中的病态与症结所在。特别对那些明明不懂偏要装懂，自满自足，狭隘宗派，不关心国家资财，不听取群众意见，以及主观条件具备，工作可以搞好而未能搞好，或不去搞好的官僚主义作风，应给以严肃的批评，以帮助他们改进与提高。
    （五）工作检查主要是根据原定计划，检查其组织执行的情形与现况，找出有碍前进的阻力与症结，及其产生的根源，并指出解决的办法。当时可能解决的问题，要尽可能予以解决；或交给该厂领导上着手解决。但有些问题是暂时不可能解决的，那就等待以后来解决。例如汽车零件制造厂与化工厂，除本身经营管理上存在着严重的缺点外（这是主要的），在市场销路问题上还存在许多困难。即使技术条件有所改进，管理工作有所改善，以及领导作风得到转变，但使生产与营业完全搞好，实际上也还有个过程的。这次检查工作中所遇到的情况是：广大工人群众的情绪是急切要求把这些企业经营管理中所有的问题都快点解决；而某些工厂领导者却对这些问题漠然视之，或依赖等待，而不依靠群众，创造条件，尽速的改善企业经营管理的现状。这一切在生产中与企业管理中的主观的、人为的某些缺点错误，是不容许长此存在下去的。
    （六）从这此工作检查中，以及平时的了解可以清楚的看出：济市某些企业的生产与管理经营的改进上虽已有了新的开端，但仍有不少厂子行政管理得很坏，盲目生产，并存在着严重的浪费与破坏现象。在贯彻工厂民主管理的方针上，少数的厂子好一些，大多数厂子还做的很差。有不少的厂对工厂管理民主化的方针在观念上还是模糊的甚至对抗的。他们在工作中命令行事，压抑民主，不重视工人的建议与要求。某些大工厂的工会已开始把主要工作放在发动与组织生产竞赛和开展合理化建议方面。但也有许多厂子的工会仍是领导不民主；任务不明确；教育工作很薄弱。党对工会也缺乏领导与支持。工厂中党的工作，一般多停留在日常事务的圈子里，不知应该做什么，不知如何去保证与监督生产。有些厂党的组织还存在某些混乱，对生产的关心还很差，对工会与青年团的工作及群众的切身利害问题的关心研究不够，未能形成一个工厂企业中的思想、政治领导核心。总的看来，公营企业中的生产与管理经营上，新的气象是在上升着，但进步很慢，还存在许多严重的问题急需解决。解决这些问题的主要环节，是党、政、工、团集中精力领导生产和贯彻工厂管理民主化的问题。而贯彻这一方针的关键则是领导干部的思想作风问题与党的核心领导作用问题。
    最后，我们深刻体会到：及时进行工作检查，掌握重点，吸取经验，推动全盘是转变作风提高领导的重要关键。此次的工作检查，对市委领导摆脱事务主义，转变作风，及对干部政策水平的提高作用很大。今后应紧紧掌握此点，并认真的学习与贯彻中央领导方法的决定，把工作做好。
