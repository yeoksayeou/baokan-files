　　Evidence of the US Aggressors' Plot to Attack North Korea
    We are reprinting a photograph published in the British Daily Telegraph on June 26th of this year. This photograph proves that the American government's aggression in Korea was the result of long-planned schemes.

    As already reported, US Secretary of State Advisor Dulles visited South Korea and inspected the South Korean army's preparations to attack North Korea several days before the South Korean army invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    An American reporter took a picture of Dulles standing on the North-South Korean demarcation line. Dulles (far left in the photo) is standing in a trench, carefully observing a map of the area where South Korea is about to launch an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. US Army Major Billelo is explaining to Dulles. On the far right of the photo, holding a telescope, is the US Ambassador to the South Korean puppet government, Muccio. Accompanying Dulles and Muccio were officers of the South Korean army.

　　美国侵略者策动进攻北朝鲜的罪证
    我们翻印了一张今年六月二十六日英国《每日电讯报》上所登载的照片，这个照片证明了：美国政府在朝鲜的侵略是早已计划好的结果。
    正象已经报道过的：在南朝鲜军队侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以前数日，美国国务卿顾问杜勒斯访问过南朝鲜并检阅了南朝鲜军队进攻北朝鲜的准备。
    美国记者拍了一张杜勒斯站在朝鲜南北分界线上的照片。杜勒斯（照片中最左边）站在战壕里，仔细观察着南朝鲜即将发动进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的这个地区的地图。美军少校比列洛正在向杜勒斯作说明。照片中最右边，手中拿着一个望远镜的是驻南朝鲜傀儡政府的美国大使缪锡俄。伴随着杜勒斯和缪锡俄的有南朝鲜军队的军官。
