　　Building Water Conservancy, Preventing Floods and Droughts
    National Farmland Water Conservancy Develops Universally
    Irrigated Area Expanded by Over Ten Million Mu Compared to Last Year
    Task of Increasing Grain Production by 300 Million Jin This Year Has a Reliable Guarantee
    [Report from this Newspaper] The national farmland water conservancy construction in 1950, including the restoration and new construction of canals, ponds, and dams, and the development of waterwheels (iron-wheeled waterwheels) and wells, has achieved great success. Up to now, a part of the large and medium-sized canal irrigation projects nationwide has been completed, but due to the universal development of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, the irrigated area of cultivated land has been restored and increased by more than ten million mu, exceeding the original plan of eight million five hundred thousand mu. Therefore, the task of increasing grain production by 300 million jin this year through the increase of irrigated area can be ensured.

    The large and medium-sized water conservancy and irrigation projects held this year are mainly concentrated in North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China; East China and Central South China have fewer. However, small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have been developed relatively universally in all regions. At present, the water conservancy projects in more than 40 paddy field irrigation areas in the Northeast region, including the two large-scale irrigation projects of the East Liao River and Panshan Farm, have been completed, increasing the paddy field area by 315,000 mu. In the Northwest region, Shaanxi Province has completed the first phase of the famous Luo Hui Canal project and the Ding Hui and Leng Hui Canals. It has also repaired large canals such as Han Hui, Bao Hui, and Xu Hui. In Gansu Province, four of the more than ten irrigation projects such as Gu Feng, Jing Feng, Huangyang, and Shandange Lake have been completed. In Ningxia Province, the repair projects of major trunk canals such as the Hexi Daqing and Han Yan were completed in early May and began to water smoothly. Qinghai Province has repaired canals such as Changsheng and Qi Gong. Xinjiang Province has completed a huge water conservancy project of 1.2 million mu. The benefited area of the completed projects in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang is a total of 2,065,000 mu. In the North China region, Shanxi Province has completed 167 canal projects, and during the winter and spring watering period, it has vigorously carried out project repairs and appropriately controlled watering, increasing the watered area by more than 800,000 mu; the large-scale Hutuo River irrigation project has completed more than 80% of the earthwork of the trunk canal. Chahar Province has completed more than 600 medium and small-scale water conservancy projects, benefiting an area of 244,000 mu; the first phase of the three major water conservancy projects of Sanggan River, Yu River, and Hun River has been completed more than 90%, and will be fully completed in mid-July. Hebei Province has completed the repair projects of 12 medium-sized canals such as Rongzhen and Lingzheng, newly opened and repaired 705 small canals, and increased the irrigation area by 260,000 mu; the Jinmen Canal (the first phase of earthwork has been completed) and Jin Cang Canal are still under construction. Pingyuan Province has repaired canals such as Guangji and Lifeng, expanding the benefited area by more than 170,000 mu. The Ji Yun River electric pumping irrigation project directly led by the Ministry of Agriculture has been completed and put into operation in early May. The benefited area of the completed projects in the four provinces of North China is a total of 1,492,000 mu. In addition to the great achievements in repairing river embankments and sea dikes in East China, the masses have widely carried out farmland water conservancy projects such as digging ponds, repairing dams, and dredging rivers under the organization and leadership of the government and with loan support. According to incomplete statistics in Zhejiang Province alone, the masses were mobilized to repair more than 6,500 dams, dig more than 3,500 ponds, dredge 500 rivers and canals, and complete more than 22,000 other projects. Southern Jiangsu has completed more than 7 million cubic meters of earthwork for pond and dam projects and used more than 1.2 million labor days to repair enclosure fields. Shandong has completed irrigation projects such as the Xihui Canal. The total benefited area of the completed projects in East China is 7,050,000 mu. In the Central South region, Hunan Province repaired 347 dikes and embankments, dug 85,000 ponds, and repaired 120 canals. Hubei repaired 172 sluices and dams and dug 7,900 ponds. Jiangxi has completed 3,386 small-scale water conservancy projects such as the Wan'an Canal, Anfu Canal, and other ponds and dams. The total benefited area increased by 3 million mu in the entire region.

    Waterwheel and well irrigation are not yet common. This year, Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, Shandong, and Henan in the North China region are the main development areas. The above provinces have manufactured more than 81,000 waterwheels, loaned out more than 33,000 waterwheels, drilled new wells and repaired old wells 23,000, drilled 55 machine wells, and 227 large and small artesian wells, increasing the irrigated area by a total of 525,000 mu.

    In addition, this spring, mechanical irrigation and drainage work in the Jiangsu area was largely suspended due to the high prices of diesel and gasoline. In order to solve this problem, the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry provided loans to support the masses to convert the old diesel and gasoline pumping machinery into wood-fired pumping machines. The conversion work has been largely completed, and 1.6 million mu of paddy fields have been re-benefited.

    The smooth progress of water conservancy and irrigation projects this year is due not only to the fact that the local people's governments have actively led the masses to conscientiously implement the plan with a high spirit of serving the people, but also to the fact that the participation of the local People's Liberation Army in water conservancy construction has played a great role. For example, the troops stationed in Xinjiang Province completed a huge water conservancy project of 1.2 million mu this spring. The more than 4.8 million cubic meters of earthwork for the three major state-owned water conservancy projects in Chahar Province were completely undertaken by the People's Liberation Army, overcoming the difficulty of local labor shortage.

    Many canals were abandoned for a long time during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and could not be repaired, but they were repaired in less than a year after the establishment of the People's Government, which greatly moved many people. For example, when the famous Luo Hui Canal in Northwest China was repaired and started to release water this year, the masses in the irrigation area were overjoyed, beating gongs and drums to welcome the water head. Several old men in Zhoujiabao immediately knelt down and kowtowed when they saw the water coming. Meng Defang of Donghan Village said: "This is not water, it is grain." Wang Junhe of Yijing Village said: "This is the second happy event since I was born; the first happy event was when the People's Liberation Army drove away Hu Zongnan." Along the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi, many dikes have been repaired, and the bandits in Poyang Lake are no longer bandits. They said: The People's Government has repaired the dikes for us, and we have a way to make a living, why should we be bandits?!

　　兴修水利  防洪防旱
    全国农田水利普遍发展
    灌溉面积已比去年扩大千余万亩
    今年增产粮食三亿斤的任务有了可靠保证
    【本报讯】一九五○年全国农田水利建设，包括恢复和新修渠道塘坝，发展水车（铁轮水车）、水井，已有巨大成就。到目前为止，全国大中型渠道灌溉工程已完成一部，但由于小型农田水利工程的普遍发展，已恢复和增加耕地灌溉面积达一千余万亩，超过了原来八百五十万亩的计划。因此，今年由增加灌溉面积，达到增产粮食三亿斤的任务，可确保完成。
    今年举办的大中型水利灌溉工程，主要集中于华北、西北、东北等区；华东、中南数量较少。但小型农田水利工程，各区均有比较普遍发展。目前东北区各省四十多处的水田灌溉区的水利工程，其中包括东辽河和盘山农场两大型灌溉工程，业已完成，增加水田面积三十一万五千亩。西北区陕西省已完成有名的洛惠渠第一期工程及定惠、冷惠二渠。并修整了汉惠、褒惠、湑惠等大型渠道。甘肃省古沣、靖丰、黄羊、山丹革湖等十余处灌溉工程已有四处完工。宁夏省河西大清、汉延等各大干渠修整工程已于五月初竣工，开始顺利浇水。青海省已修复长胜、祁公等渠。新疆省已完成一百二十万亩的巨大水利工程。陕、甘、宁、青、新等五省现已完工的工程受益面积共为二○六万五千亩。华北区山西省已完成渠道工程一百六十七件，并在冬春浇水期间，大力进行工程修整及适当的掌握浇水，增加浇地八十万亩以上；大型的滹沱河灌溉工程已完成干渠土工百分之八十以上。察哈尔省已完成中小型水利工程六百余道，受益面积达二十四万四千亩；桑干河、御河、浑河等三大水利工程第一期工程已完成百分之九十以上，七月中旬即将全部竣工。河北省已完成荣臻、灵正等十二处中型渠道修整工程，新开修整小型渠道七百零五道，增加灌溉面积二十六万亩；金门（第一期土工已完成）、津沧等渠仍在施工。平原省已修整广济、利丰等渠道，扩大受益面积十七万亩以上。农业部直接领导的蓟运河电力抽水灌溉工程已于五月初完工放水。华北区四个省已完工程受益面积共一百四十九万二千亩。华东区除了在修整江堤，海塘工程方面已有了伟大成就外，群众在政府组织领导及贷款扶植下，广泛开展挖塘，修坝、疏浚河道等农田水利工程。据浙江一省不完全的统计，发动群众修坝六千五百余处，挖塘三千五百余口，疏浚河渠五百道，完成其他工程二万二千余件。苏南已完成塘坝工程土工七百余万公方，修整围田用工一百二十多万工。山东完成了绣惠渠等灌溉工程。总计华东区已完工程受益面积共七百零五万亩。中南区湖南省修复堤垸三百四十七个，挖塘八万五千口，修渠一二○道。湖北修闸坝一百七十二个，挖塘七千九百口。江西已完成万安渠、安福渠及其他塘、坝等小型水利工程三千三百八十六座。全区已完工程共增加受益面积三百万亩。
    水车、水井灌溉在目前还不普遍，今年以华北区的河北、山西、平原、察哈尔及山东、河南等六省为主要发展地区。上述各省目前已制造水车八万一千余辆，贷出水车三万三千余辆，打新井及修复旧井二万三千余眼，凿机器井五十五眼，大小自流井二百二十七眼，共计增加灌溉面积五十二万五千亩。
    此外，今春江苏一带机械灌溉排水工作，因为柴油、汽油价格太贵，大部陷于停顿。华东农林部为了解决这项问题，贷款扶植群众将旧日柴油、汽油抽水动力机械改装为木柴发动抽水机，改装工作已大体完成，一百六十万亩水田重行受益。
    今年水利灌溉工程的顺利进行，除各地人民政府以高度为人民服务的精神，积极领导群众认真贯彻计划外，各地人民解放军的参加水利建设，发挥了极大的作用。如新疆省驻军今年春季完成了一百二十万亩的巨大水利工程，察哈尔省三大国营水利工程的四百八十多万土方，完全由解放军担负，克服了当地劳力缺乏的困难。
    许多渠道在国民党反动统治时代，长期废弃不能整修，但在人民政府成立后不到一年即已修好，使许多群众受到极大的感动。如西北著名的洛惠渠，在今年修好开始放水时，灌溉区的群众兴高采烈，敲锣打鼓，迎接水头。周家堡几个老汉，见水下来，立即下跪磕头。东汉村的蒙德芳说：“这不是水，是粮食。”义井村的王俊和说：“我出生以来这是第二件喜事；第一件喜事是解放军打走胡宗南。”江西鄱阳湖沿岸，修整了许多堤坝，鄱阳湖的土匪即不再作土匪了。他们说：人民政府给我们把堤都修好了，生活有了办法，我们为什么还当土匪？！
