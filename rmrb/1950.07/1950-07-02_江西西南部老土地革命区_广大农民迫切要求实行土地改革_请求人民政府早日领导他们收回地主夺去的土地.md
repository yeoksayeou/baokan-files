Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th: The vast numbers of peasants in the old revolutionary base area of southwestern Jiangxi Province are eagerly demanding land reform. Since the "May Day" slogans issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reached the area, the Ganxi Southwest Administrative Office has received an average of 25 to 30 letters a day from peasants requesting land reform. Many letters are jointly written by several or dozens of peasants. The southern region of Jiangxi Province was a revolutionary base area before the Anti-Japanese War. After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army) went north to resist Japan, the peasants in the area suffered cruel devastation from the Kuomintang reactionaries and the landlord class, and much of the land was seized by the landlords. In their letters, the peasants bitterly denounced the landlord class for their cruel exploitation and personal persecution over the past decade and more, requesting the People's Government to lead them in recovering the land and abolishing the feudal land ownership of the landlords. Peasants from Xingguo, Ruijin, Ji'an, Taihe, and other counties even sent representatives from hundreds of miles away to the Administrative Office to personally express their wishes to Director Luo Jiwen of the Administrative Office. A peasant representative named Gong Lifeng presented Director Luo with a written opinion signed and fingerprinted by more than 30 people, requesting that land reform be carried out in his hometown as soon as possible.

In more than 20 counties including Ruijin and Xingguo in southern Jiangxi, before the Red Army went north to resist Japan in 1934, the vast numbers of peasants, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, had already distributed fields and abolished the feudal system of exploitation. However, after the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the Kuomintang bandits, in collusion with local landlords and despots, carried out疯狂搶劫和掠奪 (frantic robbery and plunder) against the vast numbers of peasants. They not only took all the land and property that the peasants had distributed but also intensified the implementation of higher land rent exploitation, with rent amounts as high as 50% to 80% of the total land yield. Coupled with the extortion of exorbitant taxes and levies by the Kuomintang reactionary government, the peasants were forced to fall into an even more painful situation. According to a survey of Worang Village in the Third District of Ninggang County: the village has a total of 185 households with 815 people and 1,549 mu of cultivated land. Landlords accounted for only 2.4% of the total population, but they occupied 43.3% of all cultivated land, while landless and land-poor peasants, who accounted for 87.4% of the total population, occupied only 40.13% of the land. According to a survey of Xiazhouba Village in Ruijin County, the Zeng Buqun family in the village originally had 13 people and were allocated 60 dan of land at that time. After the Red Army's Long March in 1935, all of his family's land was seized by the landlords, and Zeng Buqun's elder brother, sister-in-law, and two nephews were killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. From 1937 to 1949, for more than ten years, four members of Zeng Buqun's family starved to death and two children were sold due to a lack of livelihood. Now only Zeng Buqun, his mother, and his wife remain in his family. In more than 20 counties in southern Jiangxi, Zeng Buqun's tragic experience is just one example among millions of peasant households. Therefore, after the liberation of the area, the vast numbers of peasants actively participated in the movements to suppress bandits, oppose despots, and reduce rent. The release of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "May Day" slogans has further encouraged their fighting spirit and eagerly look forward to the early implementation of land reform.

    广大农民迫切要求实行土地改革
    请求人民政府早日领导他们收回地主夺去的土地
    【新华社南昌三十日电】江西省西南部老土地革命区广大农民迫切要求实行土地改革。自中共中央发布的“五一”口号传到该地以来，赣西南行政公署平均每天可接到农民要求实行土地改革的来信二十五封到三十封。不少的信都是几个农民或几十个农民联名写的。江西省南部地区是抗日战争以前的革命根据地，中国工农红军（人民解放军的前身）北上抗日以后，该地农民遭受了国民党反动派和地主阶级的残酷摧残，土地多为地主夺去。农民们在他们的来信中，沉痛地控诉了地主阶级近十几年来对他们的残酷剥削和人身迫害的情形，请求人民政府早日领导他们收回土地，废除地主的封建土地所有制。兴国、瑞金、吉安、泰和等县农民，并特地推派出代表，从数百里以外赶到行政公署，亲自向行政公署罗季文主任表明他们的愿望。一个名叫贡立峰的农民代表，向罗主任呈上一本由三十多个人签名和盖上指印的意见书，要求早日在其家乡进行土地改革。
    赣南瑞金、兴国等二十余县，一九三四年红军北上抗日以前，广大农民即曾在中国共产党的领导下分配了田地，废除了封建剥削制度。但在红军北上抗日后，国民党匪帮即结合当地地主、恶霸，向广大农民进行疯狂的抢劫和掠夺。他们不但把农民分得的土地财产全部抢去，并变本加厉地实行了更高的地租盘剥，租额高达土地总产量的百分之五十至八十；再加上国民党反动政府的苛捐杂税的勒索，迫使农民们重又陷入更痛苦的境地中。据宁冈县第三区沃壤村的调查：该村共一百八十五户，八百十五人，耕地共有一千五百四十九亩。其中地主仅占总人口的百分之二点四，他们却占有全部耕地的百分之四十三点三，而占总人口百分之八十七点四的无地和少地的农民，却仅占有土地百分之四十点一三。又据瑞金县下州坝村调查：该村农民曾步群全家原有十三口人，在当时曾分到六十担田。一九三五年红军长征后，他家的田就全部被地主夺去，曾步群的哥嫂和两个侄子又被国民党反动派杀害。一九三七年到一九四九年十余年间，曾步群一家因生活无着饿死了四口人，卖掉了两个孩子。现在他家只剩下了曾步群和他的母亲、妻子三口人了。在赣南二十多县中，像曾步群的悲惨遭遇只是千百万户农民中的一个例子。因此，该地区解放之后，广大农民便积极参加了剿匪、反恶霸和减租的运动。中共中央“五一”口号的发布，更加鼓舞了他们的斗争情绪，热切盼望土地改革早日实施。
