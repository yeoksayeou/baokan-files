National Financial Prices Basically Stable
    Private Silver Firms Have Two Futures
    One is to Serve Production and Can Maintain and Develop; the Other is to Not Change the Old Business Methods and Only Collapse

    [Our Newspaper] After the national financial prices stabilized, two different situations appeared in private silver firms. Most private firms actively improved their business methods, and under the leadership of the state bank, embarked on the road of joint operation and served production, thus maintaining their business and achieving normal development; some other firms still did not change their old business methods and styles, and thus collapsed or are on the road to collapse.
    Simultaneous with the temporary difficulties encountered by industry and commerce, private firms also encountered some difficulties. That is, some loans became bad debts. Taking Tianjin as an example, on March 25, among the 23 private banks, 22 had bad debts. Bad debts averaged 4.42% of the total loan amount. Therefore, private firms were wary of new loans. The amount of loans decreased; deposit interest expenses exceeded loan interest income; coupled with a large internal organization and heavy expenses, it caused temporary losses. Some firms therefore went bankrupt. However, most firms have overcome this difficulty and embarked on the road of serving production. This is manifested in the fact that the amount of deposits and loans of the firms has increased; and many firms have gained profits. For example, in May, the deposit amount of private firms in Shanghai (including public-private joint venture banks) increased by 20.3% compared with April; and the loan amount increased by 1.95%. 70% of the loans were invested in industrial production. Also, in Tianjin, about two-thirds of the firms made a profit in April. Furthermore, according to the accounting results of the firms on June 17, among the 20 private banks in Tianjin, 16 made a profit, with an average profit of more than 380 million yuan. Among the 53 money shops, 42 made a profit, with an average profit of more than 90 million yuan.
    The reasons for the improvement of private firms, in addition to the fact that the situation of industry and commerce has been improving, are mainly two. First, the firms implemented labor-capital agreements, actively developed businesses, and reduced expenses. For example, after the Jin Cheng Bank in Shanghai established a labor-capital consultation meeting in April, employees voluntarily reduced their salaries, actively worked with the capital side to overcome difficulties, and developed businesses in a planned way. By mid-May, the bank's deposits increased by 80% compared with the end of March, and loans also turned to rural areas and small-scale industry and commerce. After the Shanghai Guohua Bank went through labor-capital agreements, it put forward specific measures to overcome difficulties together. The capital side remitted 750,000 Hong Kong dollars of foreign funds back three times, which not only made up for losses and bad debts, but also increased the circulating funds. The labor side suggested new business policies to the capital side, and in order to understand the difficulties of the capital side, voluntarily reduced salaries and improved labor discipline and work morale, and finally overcame the difficulties. Second, under the leadership and assistance of the state bank, loan syndicates or joint loan offices were organized to concentrate the scattered funds into production (originally, the government had proposed the organization of loan syndicates last year, but not many firms participated at that time, and there was not much confidence, and it has only been widely organized recently). In order to encourage private firms to embark on the road of joint operation and centralized support for production, the People's Bank of China in various places, in addition to personally participating in and leading the work, also provided various conveniences to the firms participating in the joint loan in terms of deposit and loan business, and helped them solve the difficulties they encountered. For example, firms can deposit part of their deposits into the state bank to reduce the burden of paying interest on deposits; the People's Bank of China also handles bill acceptance, re-mortgage, and rediscount, etc., which solves the difficulty of insufficient working capital for firms. This removes the ideological concerns of private firms, boldly expands their businesses, and participates in loan syndicates. As of the beginning of June, cities that have organized loan syndicates or joint loan offices include Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Beijing, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou. Due to participating in the joint syndicate, the social credit of private firms has gradually improved. The change in the deposit situation of private money shops in Tianjin is a good example. In the week from June 4 to June 10, the total deposit amount of the 18 money shops participating in the credit union increased from 11.7 billion to 13.9 billion, an increase of 2.2 billion. The total deposit amount of other money shops that are not members of the credit union decreased by 500 million.
    However, during the same period, there were also collective bankruptcies of firms. According to statistics, from February 6 to June 16, 101 firms went bankrupt in Shanghai; from March to the end of June, 50 went bankrupt in Tianjin; and from March to the end of June, 25 went bankrupt in Beijing. The People's Bank of China in Tianjin analyzed three reasons for the bankruptcy based on 17 bankrupt firms: 1. The style is not upright and the management is poor. These firms still used large profits to absorb deposits as in the past, and then lent out at high interest rates, expanding credit and lending without choosing objects. After the price stabilization, it caused a lot of bad debts. In the week from April 10 to April 15, the bad loans of private banks accounted for 4% of the loan amount, and those of money shops accounted for 12%. After the occurrence of bad debts, interest payments were stopped, but deposit interest still had to be paid. This caused a lot of losses. At the same time, depositors heard that there were bad debts, and they came to withdraw money one after another. Therefore, the working capital of private firms failed to circulate, and they had to rely on high interest rates to absorb deposits again, or borrow from peers to make up for it. However, the loophole became bigger and bigger until it went bankrupt. 2. Extravagant waste, too many redundant personnel, and too much expenditure. The monthly salary of some managers was as high as 600 discounted units (about 3,000 jin of millet). 3. Violating laws and regulations, using customer names to apply for loans. For example, the assistant manager and commissioner of the Dazhong Bank applied for loans for a long time without repaying them; the assistant manager and deputy director of the business department of the Yaxi Bank applied for loans amounting to more than 17 million. As a result, funds were scattered and stagnant, and after the price stabilization, it was difficult to repay, causing serious losses to the firms themselves.

　　全国金融物价基本稳定
    私营银钱业有两个前途
    一是为生产服务就能维持和发展  一是不改变旧经营方式只有垮台
    【本报讯】全国金融物价稳定以后，私营银钱业中出现了两种不同的情况。大部分私营行庄积极改进经营方式，在国家银行的领导下，走上联营的道路，为生产服务，因而得以维持营业并有了正常的发展；另外一些行庄仍旧不改变旧的经营方式和作风，因而垮了台，或正在走向垮台。
    与工商业遇到暂时困难的同时，私营行庄也遇到了一些困难。即，部分放款成为呆账。以天津来说，三月二十五日，在二十三家私营银行中，有呆账的达二十二家。呆账平均占放款总额的百分之四·四二。因而私营行庄对于新的放款有戒心。放款金额减少；存款利息支出超过放款利息收入；加以内部组织庞大，开支浩繁，造成暂时的亏损。有的行庄因而倒闭。但大部分行庄却已度过了这种困难，走上为生产服务的道路。这表现为行庄的存放额已有增加；不少行庄已获得盈余。如五月份上海私营行庄（包括公私合营银行在内）的存款额较四月份增加了百分之二○·三；放款额增加百分之一·九五。放款中有百分之七十是投入工业生产的。又如天津，在四月份约有三分之二的行庄获得盈余。再以六月十七日行庄的账面匡计的结果来说，津市二十家私营银行中，获得盈余的有十六家，盈余平均在三亿八千余万元。五十三家钱庄中，获盈余的有四十二家，盈余平均有九千余万元。
    私营行庄情况好转的原因，除了工商业的情况已经趋向好转以外，最主要的有两个。首先是行庄内部实行劳资协议，积极发展业务，减少开支。如上海金城银行，四月间成立劳资协商会议后，职工自动减低薪金，并与资方积极设法克服困难，有计划地展开业务。至五月中旬，该行存款比三月底增加百分之八十，放款也转向农村和小型工商业。上海国华银行经过劳资协议，提出了共度难关的具体办法。资方三次调回国外资金达港币七十五万元，不但弥补了亏损和呆账，而且增加了周转的资金。劳方向资方建议新的业务方针，并为了体谅资方的困难，自动减低薪金，提高劳动纪律和工作情绪，终于克服了困难。其次，是在国家银行的领导和帮助下，组织联合放款银团或联合放款处，将分散的资金集中投入生产（本来，政府在去年就曾提出组织联合放款银团，但那时参加的行庄不多，而且信心也不大，最近才普遍地组织起来）。各地人民银行为了鼓励私营行庄走上联营、集中扶助生产的道路除亲自参加和领导外，并对参加联合放款的行庄在存放款业务上，给予各种方便，帮助它解决自身所遇到的困难。如行庄可以将部分的存款存入国家银行，减轻存款付息的负担；人民银行并办理票据承兑，办理转抵押、再贴现等，解决了行庄头寸周转不灵的困难。这就解除了私营行庄的思想顾虑，大胆展开业务，参加联合放款银团。截至六月上旬为止，已经组织联合贷款银团或联合放款处的，有上海、天津、汉口、北京、南京、济南、青岛、南昌、杭州、无锡、苏州等城市。由于参加了联合银团，私营行庄的社会信用逐渐提高。天津私营钱庄存款情况的变化，就是一个好例子。六月四日至十日的一周内，参加信用联合会的十八家钱庄的存款总额，从一百一十七亿增至一百三十九亿，即增加了二十二亿。而其他非信用联合会会员的钱庄的存款总额却减少了五亿。
    但在同一个时期内，也有集体性的行庄倒闭的情形。据统计，上海由二月六日至六月十六日，倒闭的行庄达一百零一家；天津从三月至六月底，倒闭了五十家；北京从三月至六月底，倒闭了二十五家。倒闭的原因，天津人民银行根据十七家倒闭的行庄分析出了三个：一、作风不正派，经营不善。这些行庄仍像过去一样，用大利吸收存款，再以高利贷出，膨胀信用，放款不择对象。物价稳定后，造成很大的呆账。在四月十日至十五日的一周之内，私营银行呆滞的放款达放款额的百分之四，钱庄的占百分之十二。呆账发生后，停止付息，而存款利息仍须照付。这样就造成了很大的亏累。同时存户听到有了呆账，便纷纷前来提款。因而使私营行庄资金周转失灵，只有靠高利再吸收存款，或向同业拆借，以资弥补。但漏洞却越来越大，直到倒闭为止。二、铺张浪费，冗员太多，开支太大。有的经理每月薪金高达六百个折实单位（约三千斤左右小米）。三、违反法纪，利用客户名义套用放款。如大中银行襄理、专员，套用放款，久久不还；亚西银行襄理及营业副主任，套用放款达一千七百余万。因之资金流散、呆滞，物价稳定后，归还困难，使行庄本身蒙受严重损失。
