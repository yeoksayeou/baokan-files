Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 13th (TASS): Seoul Radio broadcast: Northern Korean youths from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are responding to Chairman Kim Il-sung's call and voluntarily joining the People's Army one after another.

Before departing for the front lines, the youths resolutely expressed their determination to drive out the American aggressors and unify the country.

A young miner named Cai Chengshan (transliteration) said: "The American imperialists' attack is aimed at turning our country into a colony. However, they will never be able to break the spirit of the Korean people who are fighting for their freedom and independence. The Korean people must defend their homeland and defeat the American imperialist aggressors."

A farmer named Li said: "The American imperialists barbarously bomb and shell peaceful cities, villages, and people in Korea. These barbarians even cruelly strafe peaceful people working in the fields with machine guns. However, the American imperialists' plan to enslave Korea is doomed to fail. Korea will belong to the Korean people for generations to come. I will never let anyone take away my share of land given to me by the land reform."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th: It has been learned here that in the four days from July 3rd to 6th, the American imperialist fleet carried out beastly shelling of streets and rural areas on the shore near Jumunjin on the east coast of Gangwon Province. As a result, more than 1,000 houses and schools on the streets of Jumunjin were bombed or damaged, and thirty fishing boats were damaged or sunk. Many elderly, weak, women, and children were injured or killed. The American aggressors' bestial atrocities have aroused boundless anger and hatred among the residents of the fishing ports on the east coast. They are pouring all their strength into supporting the front lines in order to completely eliminate the American invading army.

    朝鲜人民踊跃参军 
    美舰炮击激起海岸人民无比愤怒
    【新华社讯】塔斯社汉城十三日电：汉城电台广播：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部青年响应金日成主席的号召，陆续自愿参加人民军。
    青年们出发前线时，都坚决表示他们要赶走美国侵略者和统一国家的决心。
    青年矿工蔡成善（译音）说：“美帝国主义者的进攻是要把我们国家变为殖民地。但是，他们永远不能击破为自己的自由与独立而斗争的朝鲜人民的精神。朝鲜人民一定要保卫他们的祖国，打退美帝国主义侵略者”。
    一个姓李的农民说：“美帝国主义者野蛮地轰炸和炮击朝鲜的和平城市、乡村和人民。这些野蛮人甚至以机枪残忍地扫射在田地里工作的和平人民。不过，美帝国主义者奴役朝鲜的计划定会失败。朝鲜将世世代代属于朝鲜人民。我决不让任何人夺去土地改革给我的一份土地。”
    【新华社平壤十四日电】此间获悉，在七月三日到六日的四天中，美帝国主义的舰队在江原道东海岸注文津附近的海上，对岸上的街道与农村进行兽性的炮击。结果使注文津街道上的一千余所民房与学校被炸毁或破坏，三十只渔船被破坏或击沉。老弱妇孺伤亡甚众。美国侵略者的野兽暴行，激起了东海岸各渔港居民无比的愤怒与憎恨。他们正倾注一切力量支援前线，以彻底消灭美国侵略军。
