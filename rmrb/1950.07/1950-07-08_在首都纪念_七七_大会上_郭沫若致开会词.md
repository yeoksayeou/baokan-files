At the Capital's "July 7th" Commemoration Meeting
Guo Moruo's Opening Speech

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, gave a speech at the Beijing Municipal Commemoration of the 13th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident. The full text is as follows:

Today is the 13th anniversary of the July 7th Incident. Thirteen years ago, this was a painful day, but today it is a glorious day, a victorious day. This is the anniversary of the Chinese people's opposition to imperialist wars of aggression, and it is the anniversary of the Chinese people's achievement of fundamental peace under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.

There is no doubt that the eight-year Sacred War of Resistance was led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. In order to go north to resist Japan, our people's armed forces carried out the Long March of 25,000 li under extremely difficult conditions, detouring from Jiangxi to northern Shaanxi, laying the foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance. Speaking only of this point, it is clear enough who the leader of the War of Resistance was. And on the side of the reactionaries? The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, unable to withstand the oppression of the people, although agreeing to the War of Resistance on the surface, were always passive against Japan and actively anti-Communist, using the guise of the War of Resistance to intensify the exploitation of the people, and further fattening the bureaucratic capital of the four major families. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang engaged in smuggling-style sales of the motherland to Japanese imperialism during the War of Resistance, and openly sold out to American imperialism after the War of Resistance. No one will doubt this clear fact. Therefore, as we commemorate this glorious and victorious day today, we must pay our respects to Chairman Mao, to the Chinese Communist Party, and to the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

On this glorious and victorious day, there is another important thing we must remind everyone of, which is that our War of Resistance received the sincere and earnest help of the Soviet Union from beginning to end. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the only country in the world that helped our country was the Soviet Union. After eight years of arduous struggle, it was the Soviet Union that sent troops to the Northeast, cooperating with our people's armed forces to defeat the one million strong Kwantung Army, the most elite force of Japanese imperialism, within two weeks, thereby liberating the entire Northeast, liberating half of Korea, and causing Japanese imperialism to surrender. The Soviet Union is not only our Chinese people's friendly and mutually assisting ally today, but was our friendly and mutually assisting ally during the War of Resistance, and even long before that. Therefore, as we commemorate this glorious day today, we cannot but pay our respects to the Soviet people, to the party of Lenin and Stalin, and to Marshal Stalin!

At the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, our request from the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace was accepted, and July 1st to July 7th was designated as the Peace Declaration Signature Campaign Week. It is hoped that all agencies, troops, parties, groups, and all patriotic people across the country will take advantage of every opportunity to respond to the call of the World Peace Congress and launch a signature campaign for the Peace Declaration. The intention is very clear. July 1st is the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, and July 7th is the anniversary of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, resisting Japanese imperialism. From July 1st to July 7th, this indicates that all of us Chinese people must, from beginning to end, unite around the Chinese Communist Party, consolidate the domestic united front against wars of aggression, and participate in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, consolidating the international united front for the defense of world peace. Today is the last day of Peace Declaration Signature Campaign Week. We believe that our peace-loving Chinese people have not only carried out the signing task by the thousands and tens of thousands, but by the tens of millions and hundreds of millions, expressing our Chinese people's firm will to oppose imperialist wars of aggression.

Today, the necessity of opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace is even more urgent.

The United States is the Successor to the Fascist Axis Powers

Thirteen years ago today, Japanese imperialism was baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, running rampant, engaging in aggression, and disrupting peace in the Far East, and soon World War II broke out. What about today, thirteen years later? It is again American imperialism that is baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, running rampant, engaging in aggression, and disrupting peace in the Far East.

Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has become the successor to the fascist Axis powers, and in the Far East, it has inherited the position of Japanese imperialism, shamelessly and arrogantly plotting to provoke war. After Japan's surrender, American imperialism aided the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in China to provoke civil war, and suffered a tragic defeat. However, the American imperialists, unwilling to learn a lesson, have recently intensified their efforts, becoming even more shameless and arrogant.

First, in Japan, after carrying out all sorts of reactionary measures, MacArthur, the American commander, went all the way and released Japanese war criminals in large numbers, while doing its utmost to suppress and destroy the Japanese Communist Party, which was striving for freedom and liberation for the Japanese people, intending to enslave the Japanese people, turning Japan into a colony and using Japan as a springboard for war. The Japanese people's struggle for liberation has undoubtedly increased in difficulty.

Then, on June 27th, American President Truman openly declared the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, dispatching American naval, air, and land forces to directly invade Korea, carrying out armed interference in Korea's internal affairs. Moreover, it interfered in our Taiwan, and likewise interfered in the Philippines and Vietnam. Such arrogance and shamelessness is the trinity of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo!

Even though American imperialism is holding the United Nations hostage, relying on the hypocritical majority of a small group of vassal states as a fig leaf for its aggressive crimes, that is not something that can deceive even a three- or four-year-old child. That is precisely covering one's ears while stealing a bell, deceiving oneself. In fact, all the international agreements on which the United Nations was founded – the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Agreement, and the United Nations Charter – have been torn up by American imperialism. This cannot in any way indicate that American imperialism is justified, but it unequivocally indicates that American imperialism is cornered and desperate.

We Support Chairman Mao and Foreign Minister Zhou's Call

Chairman Mao said at the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on June 28th: "American aggression against Asia can only arouse widespread and resolute resistance from the people of Asia. Truman declared on January 5th this year that the United States would not interfere in Taiwan, but now he himself has proved that was false, and at the same time tore up all international agreements of the United States regarding non-interference in China's internal affairs. American interference in the internal affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc., is completely unreasonable. The sympathy of all the Chinese people and the sympathy of the broad masses of the people of the world will stand on the side of the victims of aggression, and will never stand on the side of American imperialism." Chairman Mao called on "the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world to unite, make full preparations, and defeat any provocation by American imperialism."

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai also issued a solemn statement on the 28th: "The US government's instigation of the Rhee Syngman puppet army of Korea to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a predetermined step by the United States, the purpose of which is to create an excuse for the US to invade Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and is precisely a further action by American imperialism to interfere in Asian affairs." Foreign Minister Zhou then issued a call to the whole world on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China: "All peace-loving, just, and free people of the world, especially the oppressed nations and peoples of the East, unite and rise up to stop the new aggression of American imperialism in the East."

We firmly support the call of Chairman Mao and Foreign Minister Zhou. There is no doubt that: "No matter what military obstruction the US government takes, the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan." Similarly, there is no doubt that: "The Chinese people express sympathy and respect for the people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan who are also subjected to American aggression and are also engaged in the struggle against resistance."

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko also issued a solemn statement on the 5th of this month, denouncing American imperialism's armed interference in Korea and open aggression against Asian countries, pointing out that American imperialism should be responsible for the consequences of armed aggression; and declaring that "the Soviet government has always adhered to the policy of strengthening world peace and the consistent principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries." The Soviet government's open and aboveboard just stance not only dealt a head-on blow to the warmongers, but also gave unparalleled encouragement to the peace camp. Imperialist warmongers often clamor that the Soviet Union is an "aggressor country," using this to cover up their war conspiracies. Today, with clear facts before us, who is launching wars of aggression, who is defending peace, and who is an out-and-out aggressor country?

War Demons are Digging Their Own Graves

Particularly infuriating is the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities, which is a consistent trick of the inhuman fascists. When Japanese imperialists invaded us, they indiscriminately bombed many of our peaceful cities, killing and wounding many of our peaceful residents. Nazi Germany did the same when it attacked the Soviet Union, and American imperialists did the same during the war against Japan. In particular, when the Soviet Union sent troops and the war against Japan was about to end, the American imperialists, in order to offset the effect of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops, dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, without harming a single hair of the Japanese warlords, but killing countless women, old people, young students, and patients in hospitals. We dare to believe that the Japanese people will never forget this favor from American imperialism, and will eventually repay it one day. Today, American imperialists are again indiscriminately bombing cities such as Pyongyang in North Korea. Blood debts must be paid in blood. What happened to the Japanese demons who bombed our peaceful cities? What happened to the German demons who bombed the peaceful cities of the Soviet Union? What will happen tomorrow to the American demons who are bombing the peaceful cities of Korea? They will soon know for themselves!

The People of Asia Will Surely Defeat the Aggressors

Today is the July 7th Commemoration, our glorious day of opposing Japanese imperialist aggression, but we must repeat once again: we "express sympathy and respect for the Japanese people who are also subjected to American aggression and are also engaged in the struggle against resistance."

Although the aggression of the Japanese imperialists thirteen years ago forged a deep blood feud with us, the Japanese people at that time were also suffering from the persecution of the Japanese imperialists. Today, the situation of the Japanese people is even completely consistent with the situation in Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and our situation before liberation, falling into the fate of a colony or semi-colony, suffering from the dual persecution of domestic reactionaries and American imperialism. We believe that the Japanese people today will have a deeper level of awareness, and will strengthen their arduous struggle against enslavement.

We have a very valuable experience to contribute to the people of all Asia and the world who are striving for liberation, which is to expand and consolidate the domestic united front under the leadership of the Communist Party and the international peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. This is the dual guarantee of the final victory of the national liberation struggle. It was with this dual guarantee that we Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and defeated the large-scale joint offensive of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Today, the armed forces of the Korean people have initially defeated the invasion of American imperialism and the Rhee Syngman puppet army, and at the beginning of the war, they quickly recovered Seoul, Incheon, and Suwon in a short period of time, beating some American generals into a state of panic and disarray. This once again proves the extreme value of this experience. We firmly believe that as long as we are willing to absorb this valuable experience and can apply it flexibly, any imperialist aggression can be defeated, and the final victory will surely belong to the people.

　　在首都纪念“七七”大会上
    郭沫若致开会词
    【本报讯】中国保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在北京市举行纪念“七七”十三周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    今天是七七的第十三周年纪念。这在十三年前是一个沉痛的日子，但在今天已经是一个光荣的日子、胜利的日子。这是我们中国人民反对帝国主义侵略战争的纪念日，是我们中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下争取到了基本上的和平的纪念日。
    八年的神圣抗战，毫无疑问，是毛主席和中国共产党所领导的。为了要北上抗日，我们的人民武力在万分困难的条件之下进行了二万五千里长征，由江西纡回到陕北，奠定了抗日胜利的根据地。单只说这一点，抗日战争的领导者是谁，已经够明了了。而在反动派方面呢？蒋介石匪帮，受不过人民的压迫，虽然在表面上同意了抗战，但它们始终是消极对日、积极反共，借着抗战的帽子加紧剥削人民，更加养肥了四大家族的官僚资本。蒋介石匪帮在抗日战争期间是走私式的向日本帝国主义者出卖祖国，在抗日战争结束后便是公开地向美国帝国主义出卖。这一明白的事实，谁也不会怀疑了。因此，我们在今天纪念这个光荣胜利的日子，我们就不得不向毛主席致敬，向中国共产党致敬，向中国人民解放军致敬！
    在今天纪念这个光荣胜利的日子，还有一件重要的事，我们须得提醒，便是我们的抗日战争自始至终都得到了苏联的诚心诚意的帮助。在抗日战争初起的时候，全世界帮助我们国家的就只有苏联。经过了八年的苦战，是苏联出兵东北，协同着我们的人民武力，把日本帝国主义的最精锐的关东军一百万人，在两星期之内击溃了，因而解放了全东北，解放了半个朝鲜，而使日本帝国主义投降的。苏联不仅在今天是我们中国人民的友好互助的盟友，就在抗日战争期间，乃至很早以前，便是我们的友好互助的盟友了。因此，我们在今天纪念这个光荣的日子，就不能不向苏联人民致敬，向列宁斯大林的党致敬，向斯大林大元帅致敬！
    中国人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上，接受了我们中国保卫世界和平大会委员会的请求，把七月一日至七月七日定为了和平宣言签名运动周，希望全国各机关、各部队、各党派、各团体、一切爱国的人士利用一切的机会，响应世界和平大会的号召，展开和平宣言的签名运动。这用意是很明白的。七一是全心全意为人民服务的中国共产党的建党纪念，七七是中国人民在中国共产党领导之下、得到苏联的协助、得以反抗日本帝国主义的抗战纪念。自七一到七七，这就指示着我们全中国人民自始至终要团结在中国共产党的周围，巩固反对侵略战争的国内统一战线，并要参加以苏联为首的和平阵营，巩固保卫世界和平的国际统一战线。今天是和平宣言签名运动周的最后一天了，我们相信，我们爱好和平的中国人民不仅是成千成万，而是成千万成万万地执行了签名的任务，表示了我们中国人民反对帝国主义侵略战争的坚强的意志的。
    在今天反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的必要是更加迫切了。
    美国是法西斯轴心国的继承者
    十三年前的今天是日本帝国主义张牙舞爪，横行霸道，从事侵略，破坏了远东的和平，不久便爆发了世界二次大战。十三年后的今天呢？又是美国帝国主义正在张牙舞爪，横行霸道，从事侵略，破坏着远东的和平了。
    自从第二次世界大战结束以后，美国帝国主义便成为了法西斯主义的轴心国的继承者，在远东是继承了日本帝国主义的地位，无耻狂妄地锐意挑拨战争。美帝国主义在日本投降后，在我们中国扶助蒋介石匪帮挑拨起内战，是遭受了悲惨的失败的。然而死不肯接受教训的美国帝国主义者近来是变本加厉、更加无耻、更加狂妄了。
    首先是在日本，美国的统帅麦克阿瑟在执行了各种各样的反动措施之后，一不做二不休地竟大批大批地释放日本的战争罪犯，而对于为日本人民争取自由解放的日本共产党，却是尽力地镇压，摧残，存心奴役日本人民，把日本化为殖民地，并把日本作为战争跳板。日本人民的解放斗争，无疑地是增加了困难。
    接着是六月二十七日，美国大总统杜鲁门更公开地声明了美帝国主义的侵略罪状，派遣了美国的海空陆军直接侵略朝鲜，对朝鲜的内政作武装干涉。而且干涉到我们的台湾，也同样干涉到菲律宾和越南。这样的狂妄无耻是希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机的三位一体！
    尽管美帝国主义挟持着联合国，依仗着一小撮附庸尾巴国的虚伪多数，作为它的侵略罪行的遮羞布，但那是连三四岁的小孩子都诳骗不了的。那正是掩耳盗铃，自己骗骗自己。事实上联合国所赖以成立的一切国际协议，雅尔达协定，波茨坦协定，联合国宪章，都被美帝国主义者一手撕毁了。这样丝毫也不能表示美帝国主义者的理直气壮，而是不折不扣地表示着美帝国主义者的狗急跳墙。
    我们拥护毛主席周外长的号召
    毛主席在六月二十八日中央人民政府委员会上说：“美国对亚洲的侵略，只能引起亚洲人民广泛的和坚决的反抗。杜鲁门在今年一月五日还声明说美国不干涉台湾，现在他自己证明了那是假的，并且同时撕毁了美国关于不干涉中国内政的一切国际协议。美国对朝鲜、菲律宾、越南等国内政的干涉，是完全没有道理的。全中国人民的同情和全世界广大人民的同情都将站在被侵略者方面，而决不会站在美帝国主义方面。”毛主席号召“全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅”。
    周恩来外长在二十八日也发表了严正的声明：“美国政府指使朝鲜李承晚傀儡军队对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，乃是美国的一个预定步骤，其目的是为美国侵略台湾、朝鲜、越南和菲律宾制造借口，也正是美帝国主义干涉亚洲事务的进一步行动”。周外长接着代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府对全世界发出号召：“全世界一切爱好和平正义和自由的人类，尤其是东方各被压迫民族和人民，一致奋起，制止美国帝国主义在东方的新侵略。”
    我们对于毛主席和周外长的号召是坚决拥护的。毫无疑问：“不管美国政府采取任何军事阻挠，中国人民抱定决心，必将要解放台湾”。同样地毫无疑问：“中国人民对于同受美国侵略并同样进行反抗斗争的朝鲜、越南、菲律宾和日本人民表示同情和敬意”。
    苏联副外长葛罗米柯本月五日也发表了严正的声明，痛斥了美帝国主义武装干涉朝鲜和对亚洲各国的公开侵略，指出美帝国主义应对武装侵略的后果负责；并声明“苏联政府始终坚持加强世界和平的政策和一贯不干涉他国内政的原则”。苏联政府的这种光明正大的正义立场，不仅给予了战争贩子们当头一棒，同时也给予了和平阵营以无上的鼓励。帝国主义战争贩子们时常叫嚣着苏联是“侵略国”，用这来掩饰它们的战争阴谋，今天有明朗的事实摆在面前，到底谁在发动侵略战争，谁在保卫和平，谁是不折不扣的侵略国呢？
    战争魔鬼在自掘坟墓
    特别令人愤恨的是对于和平城市的滥施轰炸，这是法西斯主义者惨无人道的一贯的技俩。日本帝国主义者侵略我们的时候，曾经滥炸了我们不少的和平城市，杀伤了我们不少的和平居民。纳粹德国进攻苏联的时候是这样，美帝国主义者在对日战争时也是这样。特别是苏联出兵，对日战争快要结束的时候，美帝国主义者为了抵消苏联出兵的功效，在日本广岛和长崎投下了两枚原子炸弹，没有伤害日本军阀的一根头发，却是炸死了无数的妇女老弱、青年学生和病院中的病人。我们敢于相信，日本人民对于美帝国主义的这番恩惠是永远不会忘记，而且总有一天会报答的。今天美帝国主义者又在北朝鲜平壤等城市滥施轰炸了。血债是要用血来偿还的，一些战争魔鬼在掘着自己的坟墓。滥炸过我们的和平城市的日本魔鬼们，今天怎样了？滥炸过苏联的和平城市的德国魔鬼们，今天怎样了？滥炸着朝鲜的和平城市的美国魔鬼们，明天会怎样，他们自己很快就会知道！
    亚洲人民一定能打败侵略者
    今天是七七纪念，是我们反对日本帝国主义侵略的光荣日子，但我们要特别重说一遍：我们是“对于同受美国侵略并同样进行反抗斗争的日本人民表示同情和敬意”的。
    十三年前日本帝国主义者的侵略虽然和我们结下了血海深仇，但日本人民在当时是同样受着日本帝国主义者的迫害。今天日本人民的境遇更和朝鲜、越南、菲律宾以及我们在解放前的情形完全一致了，陷入了殖民地或半殖民地的命运，受着国内反动派和美国帝国主义的双重迫害。我们相信，日本人民在今天是会有更深一层的觉悟，而加强着他们的反抗奴役的艰苦斗争的。
    我们有一个很可宝贵的经验可以贡献给全亚细亚和全世界争取解放的人民，便是扩大并巩固在共产党领导之下的国内统一战线和以苏联为首的国际和平阵营。这是民族解放斗争的最后胜利的双重保障。我们中国人民是有了这双重保障而击溃了日本帝国主义并击溃了美国帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮的大规模的联合进攻。
    今天朝鲜人民的武装力量初步击败了美帝国主义和李承晚傀儡军队的进犯，战争一开始，短时间内便收复了汉城、仁川、水原，打得一些美国将军们鸡飞狗跳，狼狈万状。又一次证明了这一经验的极端宝贵。我们坚决地相信，只要肯吸收这次宝贵的经验，并能够灵活地运用，任何帝国主义的侵略都是可以击溃的，最后的胜利必定是属于人民的。
