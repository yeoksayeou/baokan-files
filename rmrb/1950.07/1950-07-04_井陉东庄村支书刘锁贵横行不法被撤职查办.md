　　Liu Suogui, Party Secretary of Dongzhuang Village in Jingxing, Dismissed and Investigated for Rampant Illegal Activities
　　Liu Suogui, the Party Secretary of Dongzhuang Village in the Fifth District of Jingxing, and Liang Lusuo, the public security officer, infringed upon the interests of the masses, endangered human rights, and affected the productive enthusiasm of the masses. The facts are as follows:
　　The land certificates of the village were issued to households in January of last year. However, Liu Suogui and Liang Lusuo still arbitrarily exchanged the land of the masses. For example, Liu Suogui forcibly exchanged his two mu of bad land in the west of the village for two mu of paddy fields in the south of the village. Liang Lusuo forcibly took back the five fen of land (including two fen of land improved with ninety workdays) that the liberated farmer Ren Sanyuan had been allocated, taking it for himself. Consequently, Ren Sanyuan held his land certificate and said, "What use is this!" In the year or so since the land certificates were issued, the land of eleven households, totaling more than twenty mu, had been moved in the village of seventy-six households. This seriously affected the productive enthusiasm of the masses. In addition, the entire village's more than 1,900 jin of fruit grain had been distributed to the farmers as early as 1948. However, in November of last year, Liu Suogui and Liang Lusuo forced the masses to return it, using this grain to buy a flock of sheep as their private property. Liu Suogui built three millstone rooms, using a portion of the village government's timber and eight telephone poles. Because of insufficient timber, he also privately took away the two large beams belonging to farmers Liu Gengui and Liu Baoshun. The two of them also cut down two locust trees belonging to Liu Tinggui.
　　In addition, they frequently oppressed the masses and seized property. For example, in November of last year, Liang Lusuo, under the pretext of checking household registrations, took militiamen to the home of middle peasant Liu Jinting, accusing him of harboring landlords and sealing up three urns of wheat, forbidding anyone to use them. Three days later, Party Secretary Liu Suogui took one shi of wheat from Liu Jinting's home under the guise of borrowing grain. The mother of Liu Bingxiao was a widow who wanted to remarry, but Liu Suogui refused to allow it. The widow Liu had to give him six silver dollars before he would allow the marriage. In December of last year, public security officer Liang Lusuo beat three people, including Liu Jicai and Wu Xiuyuan (Liu Jicai was frightened and ran away, and has not returned since. His family's production and livelihood have been greatly affected). In order to suppress the opposition of the masses, he even threatened them with despicable means, saying that they were bad people.
　　In April of this year, the county government sent a special person to the village to investigate, and the situation was found to be completely true. A mass meeting of the entire village was immediately convened, and they were severely criticized. It was announced that Liu Suogui and Liang Lusuo had seriously violated human rights, infringed upon private property, and violated policies. They were dismissed from their posts and sent to the government for legal action. All occupied property was to be returned to the original owners, and apologies were to be made to the original owners.

　　井陉东庄村支书刘锁贵横行不法被撤职查办
    井陉五区东庄村支部书记刘锁贵、公安员梁路锁二人侵犯群众利益，危害人权，影响了群众的生产情绪。事实经过如下：
    该村的土地证于去年一月间即发到户。但刘锁贵、梁路锁仍随便抽换群众的土地。比如，刘锁贵曾将自己村西的二亩坏地强换了村南水地二亩。梁路锁将翻身农民任三元分到的五分地（内有用九十个工修好的场地二分）硬抽归自己。于是任三元拿着土地证说：“这顶个啥用！”自发下土地证后，在一年多的时间内，该村七十六户人家共抽动了十一户的土地，计二十余亩。严重的影响了群众生产情绪。另外，全村的一千九百余斤果实粮，早在一九四八年就分给农民。但在去年十一月间，刘锁贵、梁路锁却强迫群众退出，用这笔粮买了一群羊作为他俩的私产。刘锁贵盖了三间碾房，用掉村政府的木头一部及电线杆八根；因木料不足，又将农民刘根贵、刘保顺的两根大梁私自拿去用掉。他们二人还砍掉了刘廷贵的两棵槐树。
    此外，他们还经常压迫群众，侵夺财物。比如梁路锁在去年十一月间借查户口为名，带着民兵到中农刘金廷家里，说他包庇地主，将三瓮麦子查封不准动用。三天后支书刘锁贵又以借粮方式从刘金廷家弄了一石麦子。刘兵小的母亲是个寡妇，想改嫁，可是刘锁贵不让。刘寡妇只得给了他六块白洋才让结婚。公安员梁路锁在去年十二月间殴打了群众刘吉财、武秀元等三个人（刘吉财被吓跑后至今未归。他家里生产生活均受到很大的影响）。为了压制群众的反对，他竟以卑鄙手段威胁群众，说他们是坏人。
    今年四月间县政府派专人至该村调查，情况完全属实。当即召开全村群众大会，对他们进行了严重的批评。并宣布刘锁贵、梁路锁二人严重侵犯人权，侵犯私人财产，违犯政策，予以撤职，送政府法办。所侵占之财物一律退还原主，并向原主道歉。
