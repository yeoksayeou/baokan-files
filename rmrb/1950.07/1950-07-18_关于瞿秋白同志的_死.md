　　On Comrade Qu Qiubai's "Death"
　　Zang Kejia
　　Editor's Note: After Comrade Qu Qiubai's death, the Kuomintang reactionaries deliberately published some revised or fabricated "posthumous works" in the newspapers at the time, which led to misinformation and distorted history. Comrade Zang Kejia wrote an article to clarify this. Comrade Yang Zhihua, Comrade Qiubai's wife, also sent a letter to this newspaper, expressing her agreement with Comrade Zang Kejia's opinion. Both letters are published as follows.
　　The great revolutionary and cultural fighter Comrade Qu Qiubai was brutally murdered by the Kuomintang reactionaries fifteen years ago. Reading the memorial articles written by his friends, comrades, and relatives about his multifaceted contributions to the revolutionary cause and his unwavering, "dying but not stopping" fighting life, one is filled with respect and encouragement. On "July 1st," the "Qiubai Memorial Hall" was established in the "Russian Language Training School" where he studied in his early years—now the "General Administration of Publications." It displays his works, manuscripts, photos from his childhood to his death, and Kuomintang reactionary newspapers recording the news of his arrest… Comparing these valuable materials with those memorial articles gives one a more concrete, vivid, and complete image of a hero.
　　However, some individual memorial articles are written inappropriately, distorting the facts and thus distorting the person being commemorated! Mr. Li Jiyuan's article published in the sixth issue of the first volume of "Literary Study" is one example.
　　This concerns the issue of Comrade Qu Qiubai's attitude towards life, revolution, and death at the time of his death.
　　In his memorial article, "My Impression of Mr. Qu Qiubai," Mr. Li said, "He composed poems and lyrics before calmly going to his death." What kind of poems and lyrics? "According to a friend who wrote to me, the poem is a collection of Tang dynasty lines: 'Sunset glows dimly amidst the chaotic mountains, falling leaves and cold springs sound differently. Looking back on ten years of trials and tribulations, the heart holds half a verse, all worldly ties are empty.' He said he only remembered the last two lines of the lyrics: 'In vain I spent my energy to be a hero, dusk is near, the setting sun is red.'"
　　An article entitled "Fifteen Years of Qu Qiubai's Memorial" published in the "Human Flavor" section of the Hong Kong "Weekend News" on June 24th also quoted this collection of Tang poems, but with slight differences in wording. Although I personally have not read this collection of Tang poems, I have known the line "In vain I spent my energy to be a hero" for a long time. It can be seen that these poems and lyrics have been widely circulated as anecdotes attached to Comrade Qiubai's death! These poems and lyrics are so inappropriate for such a martyr's death! They are almost a great satire, a great insult to him! These things could never have come from the pen of a revolutionary martyr; it is a hidden arrow buried by the enemy, shooting at an "enemy" after his death. Regarding this point, Comrades Du Jing and Xiao San said in "Biography of Comrade Qu Qiubai" (see page 47 of "Biographies of Martyrs"): "...After Qiubai's death, under the pressure of reactionary forces, most of what was published in the newspapers was not the original manuscript. Some letters and documents were obviously forged by the enemy, deliberately sent to various newspapers to slander Comrade Qiubai..." At the same time, according to several articles about Comrade Qu Qiubai in "Biographies of Martyrs," they all unanimously mentioned that he sang the Internationale and the Red Army Song loudly before his execution, and shouted: "To sacrifice for the Chinese revolution is the greatest glory in life!" This is the magnificent poem, the immortal poem that fits his magnificent death, his immortal death! This is simply incomparable to what was published in the "newspapers"! Those four lines of collected poems would be more or less appropriate if they came from a "sitting in meditation" Buddhist. For a revolutionary fighter, death is eternal life! As for "In vain I spent my energy to be a hero," that is simply repenting and bowing his head before "death." A revolutionary fighter who refused temptation and sacrificed his life for the people's cause would deny everything, even his own glorious history, at this final moment! This is not only impossible, but the situation is exactly the opposite.
　　Mr. Li will probably agree with this point that he intended to protect a friend but unintentionally harmed him?

### 关于瞿秋白同志的“死”

　　关于瞿秋白同志的“死”
    臧克家
    编者按：瞿秋白同志死后，国民党反动派曾在当时的报纸上故意发表些经过纂改过的或捏造的“遗作”，以致以讹传讹，歪曲了历史。臧克家同志为此写了一篇辩正的文章。秋白同志爱人杨之华同志也给本报一封信，表示同意臧克家同志的意见。兹将两信发表如次。
    伟大的革命、文化战士瞿秋白同志，被国民党反动派残杀已经十五周年了。读了他的朋友、同志、亲人们所写的纪念文章，对于他为革命事业所作出的多方面的贡献、他坚贞不拔“死而不已”的战斗的一生，令人崇敬，更令人鼓舞。“七一”那天，在他当年读过书的“俄语专修馆”——现在“出版总署”内成立了“秋白纪念堂”，陈列着他的著作、手札、自孩提一直到死的照片、记载他被捕消息的国民党反动报纸……把这一批宝贵资料和那一些纪念文章对照起来，给人一个更具体、更鲜明、更完整的英雄形象。
    可是，个别的纪念文章却有写得不恰当的地方，它歪曲了事实，因而也就歪曲了这样一个被纪念的人！李霁野先生发表在《文艺学习》一卷六期上的一篇即是一例。
    这是关乎瞿秋白同志临死时对人生、革命、和死的态度的问题。
    李先生在他的纪念文章——《瞿秋白先生给我的印象》中说到“他从容就义以前还赋诗作词”，什么样的诗词呢？“据一个朋友写信来告诉我说：诗是集唐人句：‘夕阳明灭乱山中，落叶寒泉听不同。回首十年坎坷事，心持半偈万缘空。’他说词他只记得末两句：‘枉抛心力作英雄，黄昏已近夕阳红。’”
    载在六月二十四日香港《周末报》《人间味》上的一篇《瞿秋白十五年祭》的小文上也引了这首集唐，不过字句上略有出入而已。我个人虽没读到过这首集唐人绝句，但“枉抛心力作英雄”这一句是早就知道了的。可见这些诗词作为逸事附着于秋白同志的死流传得颇为广泛！这些诗词对于这样一个烈士的死是多不相称！它们对于他简直是一个大讽刺，一个大侮辱！这些东西决不可能出自一个革命烈士的笔下，它是敌人埋伏的暗箭，向一个他死后的“敌人”射击。关于这一点，杜静、萧三两同志在《瞿秋白同志传》上（见《烈士传》四十七页）说：“……在秋白死难以后，在反动势力压迫之下，各报所发表者，多非原稿，有些信札文件，显系敌人所伪造，故意投寄各报，以中伤秋白同志……”同时，据《烈士传》里好几篇关于瞿秋白同志的文章，都不约而同的谈到他在临刑前高唱国际歌及红军歌，并大喊：“为中国革命而牺牲，是人生最大的光荣！”这才是和他雄壮的死、不朽的死合节的雄壮的诗、不朽的诗！这和“报纸”上所刊载的那些简直不能相比！那四句集诗，如果出自一个“坐化”的释教徒还差不离。对于一个革命战士，死，就是永生！至于“枉抛心力作英雄”，那简直是“死”前忏悔低头了。一个拒绝诱惑、以死殉人民事业的革命斗士，会在这最后关头否定了一切，连自己光荣的历史也在内！这不但不可能而情况恰恰是相反的。
    有意爱护朋友，却无意中损伤了他，对于这一点，李先生会有同感的吧？
