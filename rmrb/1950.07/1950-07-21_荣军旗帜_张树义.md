　　The Banner of Honored Soldiers - Zhang Shuyi
　　Gao Shungu

At the Labor Model Conference in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, there was a labor hero who had lost both legs, an honored soldier named Zhang Shuyi. When people heard how this revolutionary fighter, under the leadership of the Communist Party, had fought the enemy with unparalleled bravery on the battlefield, and how, after becoming disabled, he had steadfastly and unyieldingly led the masses in production, they all praised him as a banner for honored soldiers.

Zhang Shuyi is from Liangqiangou Village, Lingshou County, born into a poor peasant family, and is forty-four years old this year. In 1937, the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came to Lingshou County, mobilized the masses to resist Japan, and organized anti-Japanese armed forces. Zhang Shuyi joined the militia in that year, joined the Communist Party, and led two nephews to join the peasant company; soon, the peasant company was upgraded to a regular corps. In the army, Zhang Shuyi was brave in combat and skilled in shooting, successively promoted to machine gun squad leader, platoon leader, and machine gun instructor of the regiment. In combat, he once bayoneted sixteen enemies in a row, and used thirty-two grenades to stop several charges from an enemy company. Therefore, he was awarded the glorious title of "Combat Hero."

In November 1940, Zhang Shuyi lost both legs in a bombing raid by enemy planes during the battle of Longquanguan. It took six months for his injuries to heal. In 1941, he honorably retired and returned to his hometown. From then on, he could only crawl.

A stubborn man, losing both legs did not change his strong will to fight for the revolution. He was determined to actively engage in production and harvest more grain to support the front. He carried a hoe on his back and crawled up the mountain to open up wasteland, harvesting two large stones of grain in the autumn on the wasteland he had opened. In winter, he carried a sickle on his back up the mountain to cut jujube branches, exchanging them for one stone of grain.

In February 1943, the Japanese devils built a blockhouse three miles away from Liangqiangou. The villagers of Liangqiangou all left the village. Zhang Shuyi, unable to walk easily, lived in a cave in the north of the village and opened up wasteland for production. Zhang Shuyi's family also fled to other villages, and his sister-in-law constantly brought him some dry food, bran vegetable cakes, and plain water. Under such difficult living conditions, he went up the mountain to collect firewood during the day, hid in the cave when the enemy came out, and carried a hoe down the mountain to cultivate the land at night. In the evening, he secretly crawled into the village to carry manure to the fields, and climbed back up the mountain with dry food and water when the east turned bright. Because of the drought, he hung a water bucket holding thirty catties of water around his neck, crawling back and forth to plant seeds; in this way, he planted six or seven acres of land, harvesting seven stones of grain in the autumn. Later, the villagers slowly returned, and Zhang Shuyi led more than 300 male laborers in production, sending two guerrillas to the mountains to monitor the enemy every day, and returning to the mountains at night, sometimes working at night. Therefore, in this year, every household planted land and harvested grain.

In the spring of 1944, under the powerful offensive of our army, the Japanese devils in the blockhouse withdrew, and Liangqiangou was liberated. However, the houses of the villagers were either demolished or burned by the devils, and the grain was looted; when people returned home, they had no houses to live in and no grain to eat. In this situation, Zhang Shuyi mobilized everyone to engage in production, organized the digging of cave dwellings, and lent the seven stones of grain and some vegetables that he had hidden to the villagers who had no grain, temporarily solving the difficulties of food and shelter. Under the leadership of Zhang Shuyi, the masses of the whole village organized five work teams to carry out spring plowing and sowing in an organized manner. The young men and women cultivated the land, the old men sowed seeds, the children pulled the rollers, and the elderly women cooked and took care of the children at home. There was not a single idle person in the whole village. In the autumn, under the leadership of Zhang Shuyi, the masses overcame many difficulties and harvested grain, and everyone elected him as a labor hero. At the Heroic Model Conference held in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region at that time, Commander Nie awarded him a banner with the inscription "The Banner of Honored Soldiers - Zhang Shuyi," as well as a pistol and several farm tools.

In 1945, Zhang Shuyi led the masses of Shanmenkou and Tanzhuang villages (which, together with Liangqiangou, form an administrative village) to build a seven-foot-wide, nine-li-long canal, turning 130 hectares of dry land into paddy fields.

The work team of Liangqiangou, under the leadership of Zhang Shuyi, has implemented the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and has persisted until now. There are various forms of work exchange, including animal power and human power, and work exchange between those with agricultural skills and those without. In the spring of 1949, there was no rain, and he led the masses to carry out planting. In the winter, he organized men to engage in transportation and organized women to spin thread and make shoe soles. He himself still went up the mountain to collect firewood.

In the production labor of the past few years, Zhang Shuyi has developed a strong body. In addition to cultivating and sowing the land, he can do general work. He can carry a hundred catties of goods and crawl home from three or four li away. He can shake the windlass on the well platform to water the land, shaking one hundred and twenty buckets of water in one breath. Zhang Shuyi and his twenty-one-year-old nephew cultivate thirteen mu of good land distributed in the land reform, and seventeen mu of wasteland that he has reclaimed year after year. They cultivate it very well, apply a lot of manure, and the harvest is more than others, so the family is very wealthy. In December 1949, he was again elected as a labor hero by the masses and participated in the labor model conference jointly convened by the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Office and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government. This combat hero who became a labor hero who lost both legs enjoys supreme glory and respect among the masses.

　　荣军旗帜——张树义
    高顺古
    在石家庄专区的劳动模范大会上，有一位失去双脚的劳动英雄，便是荣誉军人张树义。当人们听了这位在共产党领导下的革命战士，曾以无比的英勇在战场上与敌人搏斗；残废后，又坚毅不屈积极领导群众生产时，莫不连声称赞他是荣誉军人的一面旗帜。
    张树义是灵寿县梁前沟村人，贫农出身，今年四十四岁。一九三七年，共产党、八路军到了灵寿县，发动群众抗日，组织抗日武装。张树义就在这一年当了民兵，参加了共产党，并带领着两个侄子参加了农民连；不久，农民连升编为正规兵团。张树义在部队里，作战英勇，射击熟练，一连升任机枪班长、排长和团的机枪教员。他在作战中，曾一连刺死十六个敌人，并曾用三十二颗手榴弹阻止了敌人一个连的数次冲锋。因此，获得了“战斗英雄”的光荣称号。
    一九四○年十一月里，张树义在龙泉关战斗中，被敌人飞机炸掉了两只脚。半年后他的伤才养好。一九四一年光荣退伍回到家乡。从此以后他只能爬行了。
    一个倔强的人，失去了双脚，并没有改变他为革命斗争的坚强意志。他下决心积极生产，多收些粮食支援前方。他背着镢头爬上山去开荒，秋后在他开的荒地上收了两大石粮食。冬天，他又背着镰刀上山砍枣树枝子，换了一石粮。
    一九四三年二月，日本鬼子在距离梁前沟三里的地方修了炮楼。梁前沟的老乡们都离开了村子，张树义行走不便，就住在村北的山洞里开荒生产。张树义家里的人也逃到外村去了，他嫂子不断的来给他送些干粮、糠菜饼子和白水。他在这样艰苦的生活下，白天上山打柴，敌人出动时就钻进山洞，夜里就背着锄头下山耕种地。傍晚偷偷的爬进村去把粪背到地里，等到东方发亮的时候又带着干粮和水爬上山去。因为天旱，他便将容水三十斤的水桶挂在脖子上，一趟一趟爬去进行点种；就这样种上了六、七亩地，秋后收了七石粮。后来，乡亲们慢慢的回来了，张树义领导着三百多个男劳动力进行生产，每天派两个游击队员到山上去监视敌人，晚上便回到山里去，有时夜间做活。因此这一年各家都种上地，收了粮食。
    一九四四年春天，在我军的强大攻势下，炮楼里的日本鬼子撤走，梁前沟解放了。但是，老乡们的房子被鬼子拆的拆，烧的烧，粮食被抢走了；人们回到家里，没房住又没粮吃。张树义在此情况下，便动员大家生产，组织打窑洞，把自己藏着的七石粮食和一些蔬菜，借给没粮吃的乡亲，吃住的困难暂时得到解决。全村群众在张树义的领导下，组织了五个拨工队，有组织的进行了春耕和播种。男女青壮年耕地，老头们撒种，儿童拉砘子，老年妇女在家做饭看孩子。全村一个闲人也没有。秋后，群众在张树义的领导下，克服了许多困难，收了粮食，大家便选他为劳动英雄。在当时晋察冀边区召开的英模大会上，聂司令员奖给他一面上书“荣军旗帜——张树义”的奖旗，还有手枪一枝，农具数件。
    一九四五年，张树义领导着山门口、谭庄两村（和梁前沟是一个行政村）的群众，修了一道七尺宽、九里长的水渠，将一百三十顷旱田变成水田。
    梁前沟的拨工队，在张树义的领导下，执行了自愿两利的原则，一直坚持到现在。他们拨工的形式有多种多样，有畜力的和有人力的拨工，会农业技术的与不会技术的拨工。一九四九年春天没有雨，他又领导群众进行了点种。冬天，组织男子去搞运输，组织妇女纺线纳鞋底。他自己仍然上山去打柴。
    张树义在这几年来的生产劳动中，锻炼了一副坚强的身体，除了耕地耩地外，一般活儿都能干。他能背着一百斤的东西，从三、四里远的地方爬回家去。他能到井台上摇辘轳浇地，一气能摇一百二十水斗。张树义和他二十一岁的侄子种着在土地改革中分到的十三亩好地，和他连年开垦的十七亩荒地，耕种得很好，施粪多，收成比别人也多，因此家庭很富裕。他在一九四九年十二月间又被群众选为劳动英雄，参加了石家庄专署与石家庄市政府联合召开的劳动模范大会。这位由战斗英雄成为失去双脚的劳动英雄，在群众中享有无尚的光荣与尊敬。
