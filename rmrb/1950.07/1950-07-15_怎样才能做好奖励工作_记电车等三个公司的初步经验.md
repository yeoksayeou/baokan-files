　　How to Do a Good Job of Reward Work
　　Remember the Preliminary Experience of Three Companies Including Trolleybus
　　Yin Tong
　　In June, the three companies in Beijing – trolleybus, public bus, and tap water – respectively conducted a relatively comprehensive reward program for outstanding employees in production and labor, and in conjunction with the current New Record Movement, gradually established a sound reward system. This is one of the important tasks to encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and staff.
　　　　　　Why Reward?
　　Since this spring, these three companies have seen many inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals, which have made great contributions to improving work efficiency, improving operating methods, and saving raw materials. However, the leaders of the enterprises in the past had insufficient understanding of the principle of "more work, more gain" and "taking into account both public and private interests", and did not give the due rewards in a timely manner, especially material rewards; or the rewards were too little, or no rewards at all, or they were delayed again and again under the guise of "investigation and research". This spring, the production enthusiasm of the trolleybus company's employees was generally high, but it failed to maintain it normally. When the management committee met to study this issue, it unanimously believed that "the main reason is the lack of support from the reward system". The situation in the tap water company and the public bus company was also the same, and the leaders lagged behind the masses' enthusiasm for production and labor.
　　After the three companies universally carried out rewards in June, the employees realized that improving production was beneficial to the country and also to themselves. The trolleybus company launched a warm New Record Movement. Public bus company workers said, "This is the beginning of our company's improvement." Drivers are all studying how to save fuel, reduce the failure rate of vehicles, and further improve gas vehicles to solve the company's current main difficulties in business. Previously, a few workers who were not active and did not receive awards this time all said: "Watch out for the next time, I will definitely strive to get an award."
　　While carrying out the reward work, the three companies exposed many shortcomings in factory management. First of all, there was no detailed record of the specific contributions of these outstanding employees. The tap water company's leadership usually did not go deep into the masses, and they did not find examples in time. Only when it came to rewards did they mobilize employees to collect them. The collection standards were inconsistent, and as a result, omissions were inevitable. Secondly, the cost accounting was not accurate, the statistics were not sound, and there was no fixed quota for materials. How much value does an invention have, and how much labor and materials can a technical improvement save? It can only be roughly estimated, so the amount of the reward cannot be completely fair and reasonable. This shows that the reward work must have scientific management as a basis, but the reward work can also promote the management to gradually move towards scientific management. In order to reward production, the trolleybus company established a work recording system, and recorders were set up in the road and repair factories to report the production situation to the superiors at any time, and then summarized and statistically analyzed it. In this way, the production had a more accurate record. In addition, rewards also play a certain role in promoting the precise quota of production and making up for some shortcomings of the current unreasonable wage system, which is most obvious in the public bus company.
　　The experience of the three companies proves that the significance of reward work is not only to encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, but also to greatly help improve the management system.
　　　　　　How to Reward?
　　Since the reward work lacks scientific management as a basis, it is of course difficult to evaluate the awards. The solution is to first rely on the masses of employees. The 19 employees of the West Transformer Plant of the trolleybus company spent seven months repairing two mercury rectifiers and won 4,000 kilograms of millet. However, the mobility of these 19 people is very large. Some people did not participate in this work from beginning to end, and each person's technical level is different, and the contributions vary. The award evaluators had no basis, so after determining the total amount of the bonus, they handed it over to the employees of the factory for evaluation, and only then did they get a roughly fair distribution. This shows that the reward work must follow the mass line, so that the decision of the leadership and the evaluation of the masses are combined. Relying solely on the decision of the leadership will lead to the phenomenon that the reward does not match the actual labor contribution, and also reduce the educational effect on the masses, and even get the opposite effect.
　　Secondly, the award evaluation should be based on many conditions. In addition to the general calculation of a certain percentage of the wealth increased or the cost reduced in the first year of promotion, the three companies must also evaluate technical improvements and inventions based on their role, significance, and degree of difficulty. The tap water company's employees successfully imitated the leak detector, which can save 2.5 million yuan per unit compared to buying American products. According to the calculation of adding one unit per year, the reward should be 335 kilograms of millet. However, the company cannot currently confirm how many leak detectors need to be added in a year. It would be unreasonable to award only one unit, especially since the role of this imitation work is not only to save expenses. Its contribution is to solve the company's difficulties with tools, reduce water leakage, prevent bacterial infection, and at the same time, Jinzhou and other places have also sent letters requesting orders, which can solve the needs of various places for this tool. Therefore, the company's management committee decided to increase the award amount to 1,000 kilograms of millet. In addition, when evaluating awards, on the one hand, the value of creation should be taken into account, and on the other hand, there should be differences between inventions, technical improvements, and general rationalization proposals. In principle, the reward amount for inventions should be more than that for technical improvements; the reward amount for technical improvements should be more than that for general rationalization proposals; the production surplus relying on labor enthusiasm or increasing labor intensity should be less than the above three rewards. In principle, this type of reward should not exceed one time the salary at most. In this way, encouraging the use of brains and improving operating methods can play a more effective role in promoting production.
　　The scope of rewards should be wide, and all those who have made special contributions should be rewarded, but at the same time, the method of "emphasizing key rewards" should be combined to avoid generalization or egalitarianism. The public bus company engineer Zhu Lin successfully modified the "gas vehicle" and was awarded 10,000 kilograms of millet, while Li Dequan's modification of the "firewood vehicle" was only awarded 300 kilograms of millet. This is because the "gas vehicle" reduces fuel costs the most, and is very much needed for the company's current development, so it should be rewarded more. For example, the current biggest problem for the company's bus operations is how to reduce the failure rate of vehicles so that they can run on time and at even intervals, and how to reduce fuel consumption to reduce costs. However, the company once took the performance of mileage and ticket revenue as the main standard for giving awards. As a result, workers strived for more mileage and revenue, and the failure rate of vehicles and fuel consumption became even greater. Now it has been changed to eliminating faults, saving fuel, and even workshops as the focus of award evaluation. This shows that if the award evaluation standard is correct, it can clarify the goal of each period of the employees' struggle, which is a guided improvement of production. For example, in order to solve major technical difficulties, it can be used as a special topic to call on employees to study solutions, and then give appropriate rewards. The trolleybus company solved the problem of not being able to drive in the rain for many years by adopting this method.

　　怎样才能做好奖励工作
    记电车等三个公司的初步经验
    荫桐
    京市电车、公共汽车和自来水三个公司，在六月份分别对生产劳动中的优秀职工进行了一次比较全面的奖励，并结合当前的新纪录运动，逐步树立健全的奖励制度，这是鼓舞工人、职员积极性与创造性的重要工作之一。
            为什么要奖励？
    今春以来，这三个公司出现了不少创造发明、技术改进与合理化建议，对提高工作效率、改进操作方法、节省原料材料都有很大贡献。但企业的领导者过去对多劳多得、公私兼顾认识不足，没有及时给予应有的奖励，特别是物质奖励；或者奖得太少，或者根本不奖，或者在“调查研究”，一拖再拖。电车公司职工今春生产情绪普遍高涨，但未能正常地保持下来。管委会开会研究这一问题时，一致认为：“主要是没有奖励制度支持”。自来水公司、公共汽车公司的情况也是这样，领导者落在群众积极生产劳动的后面。
    在六月份三个公司普遍进行奖励之后，职工们认识到提高生产有利于国家也有利于自己，电车公司掀起了热烈的创造新纪录运动。公共汽车公司工人说：“这是咱们公司好转的开始”。司机们都在钻研怎样节省燃料、减少坏车率、进一步改进煤气车，解决公司业务上当前主要困难。以前少数不积极、这次未得奖的工人都表示：“看下回的，我一定争取得奖。”
    三个公司在进行奖励工作的同时，暴露了工厂管理上的不少缺点。首先是这些优秀职工的具体贡献没有详确记录。自来水公司平时领导不深入群众，没有及时发现的范例，到奖励时才发动职工搜集，搜集标准不一，结果就难免有遗漏。其次是成本计算不精确、统计不健全、用料无定额，一件发明创造究竟有多大价值，一件技术改进究竟能节省多少工料，只能约摸估计，所以奖额不能做到完全公平合理。这说明奖励工作要有科学的管理做基础，但奖励工作也可以促进管理逐渐走向科学化。电车公司为了奖励建立了记工制，车路和修造厂都设了记录员，随时把生产情况报到上级，汇集统计，这样，生产就有了较精确的记载。此外，奖励对促进生产的精确定额，以及弥补目前不合理工资制度的一些缺陷也起了一定的作用，这在公共汽车公司最为明显。
    三个公司的经验证明：奖励工作的意义，不仅在于鼓励职工的积极性和创造性，对管理制度的改进，也有很大帮助。
            怎样奖励？
    奖励工作既缺乏科学管理做基础，评奖时当然会发生困难，解决的办法，首先必须依靠职工群众。电车公司西变流厂职工十九人用七个月的时间把两台水银整流器修好，得奖四千斤小米。但这十九个人流动性很大，有的人不是从头到尾都参加这个工作，每人技术水平也不同，贡献有多有少，评奖的人没有依据，于是确定了奖金总数以后，交该厂职工评议，才得到大体上公平的分配。这说明奖励工作必须走好群众路线，使领导方面的决定与群众的评议相结合。光靠领导方面的决定就会发生奖励与实际劳动贡献不符合的现象，也减少对群众的教育作用，甚至得到相反的效果。
    其次，评奖要根据多方面的条件。三个公司对于技术改进、创造发明，除一般的按推行一年所增财富或降低成本的一定比例计算外，还须根据其作用、意义和难易程度来评定。自来水公司职工仿造听漏器成功，比买美国货每部可节省二百五十万元，按一年添置一部计算，应奖小米三百三十五斤，但目前该公司不能肯定一年需要添几部听漏器，若只按一部计奖就不合理，尤其这项仿造工作的作用还不单纯在节省开支，其贡献是既解决该公司工具的困难，减少漏水，防止细菌侵染，同时锦州等地也来函要求订购，可解决各地对这项工具的要求。因此，该公司管委会决定把奖额提高到一千斤小米。此外，评奖时一方面要照顾到创造的价值，另一方面也要分别创造发明、技术改进和一般合理化建议而有所不同。原则上创造发明奖额应多于技术改进；技术改进奖额应多于一般合理化建议；依靠劳动热情或增加劳动强度而生产超额的应少于上述三项奖励，在原则上这类奖额最多也不应超过工资的一倍。如此，对鼓励开动脑筋、改进操作方法，才能起更有效的推进作用。
    奖励面要广，凡有特殊贡献的都应给以奖励，但同时要结合“重点重奖”的办法，不要形成一般化或平均主义。公共汽车公司工程师朱临改装“煤气车”成功，奖金一万斤小米，李德全改装“木柴车”奖金则只三百斤小米，是因为“煤气车”降低燃料成本最多，对该公司目前发展很需要，就该多奖励一些。又如该公司汽车行驶的当前最大问题是如何减低坏车率以按时行车、间隔均匀与如何减少燃料损耗以降低成本。但该公司曾一度以行车里数和票款收入的成绩为主要给奖标准，结果工人为争取行车里数和收入多，坏车率和燃料损耗就更大。现已改用消灭故障、节省燃料、车间均匀为评奖重点。这说明评奖标准正确，就可使每一时期职工奋斗目标明确，是有领导的提高生产。再如，为了解决技术上的重大困难，可作为专题，号召职工研究解决办法，然后给以适当奖励。电车公司即是采取这样办法解决了多年来下雨不能行车的问题。
