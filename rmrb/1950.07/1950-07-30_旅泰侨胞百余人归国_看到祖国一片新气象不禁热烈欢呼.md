Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, July 28th: The "Meili" ship, the first to carry Hainan-native overseas Chinese returning from Thailand after liberation, arrived in Haikou City on the 13th of this month, carrying a total of 134 overseas Chinese from Thailand. Upon seeing the new atmosphere and good order of Haikou after liberation, the returning overseas Chinese couldn't help but cheer and condemned the Kuomintang special agent bandits overseas for their shameless lies, such as "Haikou is in utter chaos."

Prior to this, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Hainan Military and Political Committee, in order to facilitate the return and departure of overseas Chinese, had consulted with shipping companies, hotel owners, and lightermen's representatives to reduce ship fares, hotel rents, baggage handling, and other charges, and had ordered merchants to stop exploiting overseas Chinese returning to and leaving the country through various illegal charges. The Hainan Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee also invited 60 overseas Chinese in Haikou waiting for ships to leave the country to hold a forum on the 11th of this month, reporting on the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee since its establishment. The report clarified that the current central work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee is to simplify the procedures for overseas Chinese to return to and leave the country, and to strive to smooth overseas remittances. The overseas Chinese spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, unanimously believing that during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, they regarded overseas Chinese as "fat meat," and everyone rushed to cut a piece. Today, the People's Government and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee are very considerate in caring for overseas Chinese, and they must tell overseas Chinese in various places about these situations after going abroad.

　　旅泰侨胞百余人归国
    看到祖国一片新气象不禁热烈欢呼
    【新华社海口二十八日电】解放后第一艘搭载海南籍侨胞归国的轮船美利号，于本月十三日由泰国抵达海口市，载来旅泰侨胞共一百三十四人。归国侨胞看到解放后海口的一片新生气象和良好秩序，都情不自禁地欢呼起来，并纷纷指斥海外国民党特务匪徒欺骗侨胞的所谓“海口秩序混乱不堪”等无耻谰言。
    在此以前，海南军政委员会华侨事务委员会为便利侨胞归国和出国，曾和轮船公司、旅店老板、驳艇工人代表分别协商，减低了船只票价、旅店房租、行李搬运等各项收费，并已下令禁止商人们剥削归国出国侨胞的各项非法收费。海南华侨事务委员会并曾于本月十一日邀请在海口待船出国的侨胞六十人举行座谈会，报告侨委会成立以来的工作。报告中阐明侨委会当前的中心工作为：简化侨胞归国出国手续，力求畅通侨汇。侨胞们在会上热烈发言，一致认为国民党匪帮统治时期，他们都把侨胞看成“肥肉”，大家抢着割，今天人民政府和侨委会对侨胞的爱护很为周到，出国后一定要把这些情形告诉海外各地的侨胞。
