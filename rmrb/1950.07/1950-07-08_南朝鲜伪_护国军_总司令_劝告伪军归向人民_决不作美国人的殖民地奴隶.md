Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Seoul dispatch: Song Hu-sheng, the commander of the South Korean puppet National Defense Army reserve force – the "National Defense Army," issued a statement at the Seoul Radio Station at 1:00 PM on the 4th, expressing his opposition to the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, his willingness to fight for the cause of national reunification and independence, and requesting the officers and soldiers of the puppet "National Defense Army" to stand on the side of the People's Army and guerrillas. In his broadcast, Song Hu-sheng said: "I was misled by the Syngman Rhee gang and took the road of betraying the motherland and the people. It was only when the war was triggered by the so-called 'Northward Expedition' launched by the Syngman Rhee gang, who frantically provoked the civil war, that I realized the enormity of my sins. At the same time, I quickly realized that the People's Army is a truly army that defends the interests of the people, and the People's regime is a truly regime that serves the Korean people."

In urging the officers and soldiers of the South Korean puppet "National Defense Army" to stand on the side of the People's Army and guerrillas, Song Hu-sheng said: "What is the difference between today's Americans and the Japanese of the past? Are we going to be colonial slaves of the Americans again? No, we should be a nation with autonomy. If you love the motherland and the people, if you have a national conscience, you should rise up like me to oppose the traitorous gang and the American invaders, and stand on the side of the entire people, the People's Army, and the guerrillas. I have now formed a 'People's Volunteer Army' with thousands of soldiers who have left the 'National Defense Army' and joined the People's Army and guerrillas, and I am leading them to fight alongside the People's Army to eliminate the Syngman Rhee gang, drive out the American troops who are invading our territory, and strive for national reunification and complete independence. Soldiers and officers of the 'National Defense Army,' break free from the clutches of the American invaders and come to the side of the people to defend the motherland!"

　　南朝鲜伪“护国军”总司令
    劝告伪军归向人民
    决不作美国人的殖民地奴隶
    【新华社平壤七日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社汉城讯：南朝鲜伪国防军后备军——“护国军”总司令宋虎声于四日下午一时在汉城广播电台发表声明，表示反对朝鲜卖国贼李承晚，愿为祖国统一独立的事业而奋斗，并要求伪“国防军”的官兵们站到人民军和游击队方面来。宋虎声在广播中说：“我因被李承晚匪帮所迷惑，走了背叛祖国与人民的道路。由于疯狂挑拨内战的李承晚匪帮发动所谓‘北伐’而引起了战争，我才感觉到自己的罪恶深重。同时，我很快地认识到人民军是真正拥护人民利益的军队，人民政权是真正为朝鲜人民服务的政权。”
    宋虎声在要求南朝鲜伪“国防军”的官兵站到人民军和游击队方面来时说：“今天的美国人和过去的日本人有什么不同？难道我们又要作美国人的殖民地奴隶吗？不能的，我们应该是有自主权的民族。你们如果热爱祖国与人民，你们如果有民族良心，就应该像我一样地起来反对卖国匪帮和美国侵略者，而站到全体人民和人民军及游击队方面来。我现在已将脱离‘国防军’而投到人民军和游击队方面来的数千名战士组成‘人民义勇军’，并率领他们与人民军并肩作战，以消灭李承晚匪帮，驱逐侵犯我国领土的美军，而争取国家的统一与完全独立。‘国防军’战士们和军官们，摆脱美国侵略者的魔掌，投到人民方面来保卫祖国吧！”
