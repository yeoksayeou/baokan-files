The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued an order on the 13th regarding the establishment of the Yi Sun-sin Order. The order stipulates that the First and Second Class Yi Sun-sin Orders will be awarded to naval officers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who have organized and led naval operations in the war for the unification, freedom, and independence of the fatherland, inflicting serious blows on superior enemies and establishing outstanding merits.
