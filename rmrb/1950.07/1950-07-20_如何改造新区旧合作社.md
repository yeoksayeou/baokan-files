How to Transform Old Cooperatives in New Areas

After liberation, old cooperatives in new areas with a mass base should be transformed immediately to quickly resume operations. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, thanks to the attention of party and government at all levels, the Cooperative Bureau sent working groups to various districts and counties for investigation and assistance. With the cooperation and assistance of the state-owned economy, initial but extremely important experience in transforming old cooperatives has been accumulated, and deviations in the work have been corrected. This has made it possible to restore the business of most cooperatives with conditions for resumption on the existing foundation, to sort out and clean up the assets and debts of the old cooperatives, and to enlighten the masses about the cooperatives, thus making the old appearance of the cooperatives in the new areas begin to take on a new look. Why were the above achievements obtained? In summary, there are the following points of experience:

I. The Determination of the Trusteeship Policy.

After the liberation of Xi'an, the Cooperative Bureau had a limited number of cadres from the old areas and was busy with the takeover, taking over the cooperative administrative and business organs of the enemy and puppets, and busy with educating and transforming the old cadres of the cooperative organs. Although it also sent a few cadres to conduct typical investigations, the work effect was not significant due to unfamiliarity with the situation in the new areas, and it was not able to formulate guidelines for dealing with the old cooperatives in a timely manner to guide various places. However, the local governments attached importance to the handling of the old cooperatives during this period. This is reflected in the fact that the district governments of Weinan and Lintong counties in Weinan district had considerable arrangements and understanding of the investigation and handling of the old cooperatives, and also took over a part of the old cooperatives and made preliminary plans for restoring and developing cooperative undertakings. The main reason why 100% of the county cooperatives, 48% of the district cooperatives, and 9% of the township cooperatives have resumed operations this year is the result of the local governments' emphasis on leadership and active management. However, there were also more serious deviations in the handling of old cooperatives in various places. One was takeover and monopolization, such as in Longxian County, where the accounts, furniture, and objects of the cooperatives were taken over and used as public property, causing a lot of the original assets to be lost. The Huaxian County government wanted to take over the Beisha Cooperative, causing the cooperative to hide its property. Later, the old staff members understood that the government was not confiscating it and disclosed all the property. One was ignoring them, such as in the counties of Dali district, which were liberated earliest in the Guanzhong area. Until the working group of the Cooperative Bureau went down in October, some county-level governments did not understand the situation of the cooperatives very well, and the reorganization work was at a standstill, resulting in very few cooperative restorations and developments in the whole district. This situation continued for half a year to a year. Ignoring them was because the leadership ignored the importance of cooperatives in economic construction and neglected the interests of the masses; takeover and monopolization were due to insufficient understanding of the mass nature of cooperatives, mistakenly applying the policy towards bureaucratic assets to cooperatives. These are all incorrect. Only by adopting the trusteeship policy, making it resume operations quickly, and then thoroughly transforming it, is the only correct policy. The work experience of the past six months has fully proved this point and can be affirmed without doubt.

Experience has shown that the treatment of new district cooperatives can be correct and the business of cooperatives can be quickly restored only if governments at all levels attach importance to the leadership of cooperative undertakings, take the initiative to carry out and cooperate with the work of higher levels. Otherwise, it will be very difficult. The most significant fact is that the district government of Fengxiang County in Baoji district attaches great importance to the work of cooperatives. When the Cooperative Bureau sent a working group to help, it took the initiative to cooperate, solemnly convened meetings, carefully arranged and dispatched capable cadres to participate in the work, and conducted timely inspections during the work. Therefore, the work of the county went very smoothly and achieved great results. On the contrary, the governments at all levels of Fufeng County in the district thought that cooperative work was the responsibility of the Cooperative Bureau, and they were only helping with the work. They only sent one comrade to participate in the work arrangement, and it was very perfunctory, which increased the difficulty of the work, so the effect was not great.

However, there are also deviations in the emphasis of various counties on cooperative work. That is to say, individual county-level governments regard the county federation of cooperatives as a part of the organ's production for guidance, and even find things like drawing profits. For example, the Liquan County government assisted the trade department in supplying the army with alkali salt, preventing merchants from contracting and helping to restore and develop the county supply and marketing cooperative, which is very correct; but it did not pay attention to the mass nature of the county supply and marketing cooperative, so that the business of the county supply and marketing cooperative did not promote the district cooperative to organize the masses to supply and market and assist production, and often extracted the profits of the county supply and marketing cooperative to make up for the county government's expenses, so the bank refused to lend. The Zhouzhi County government also attaches great importance to the leadership of the county federation of cooperatives, allocating confiscated materials to the cooperative for use and lending money to the cooperative for use, which is acceptable; but it is not very appropriate to regard the county federation of cooperatives' retail department as the production and operation of the organ. The main reason for the above phenomenon is the lack of understanding of the mass nature of the cooperative (the federation is also composed of members of various unit cooperatives), which is very different from the production of the organ and also different from the organ cooperative. Mixing them up and not distinguishing them will have a bad influence on the members of the cooperative.

II. Use Old Staff to Restore and Develop Business.

Because the old cooperatives in the new districts still have assets to use, and many old staff members can also be retained to work. Therefore, how to use the original assets, retain the old staff, and restore business on the original basis is very important and is one of the determining factors for developing cooperative undertakings in the new districts. In this way, old stalls can be used to serve the masses, old staff members can be identified in the resumption of operations, and more importantly, the assets of the cooperative can be completely preserved, the debts and claims can be quickly cleared, and the vast lower-level cadres of the new district cooperative undertaking can be cultivated through unity, education, and transformation of the retained staff members in the new work. Some places have done a good job in this regard and have achieved considerable results, such as the Chang'an Weiyang Cooperative, the Sanqiao Cooperative, the Huaxian Beisha Cooperative, the Xiamiao Cooperative, and the Xianyang Beigao Cooperative, etc. The original managers, staff members, and chairmen of the board of directors and supervisors were not replaced, and they continued to serve in their posts, and as a result, they were able to quickly resume operations and carry out supply and marketing or production business, the assets were completely preserved, the claims were actively cleared, and some staff members were ideologically more advanced than before.

However, there are serious shortcomings in the handling of resumption of operations and the retention of old personnel in various places. For example, Lintong County in Weinan district completely replaced a part of the old staff members of the cooperative, so that the assets and debts could not be cleared, and the resumption of operations could not be quick. There was even a phenomenon of starting to replace them, sending people to replace them, and then calling them back later because of the difficulty of the work. The indiscriminate treatment of old personnel during this period is a fundamental shortcoming. Facts have proved that except for individual cases of serious corruption, local tyrants, and evil gentry who are resented by the members of the cooperative and cannot be transformed, they should be cleaned out of the cooperative. In general, they should be distinguished between right and wrong, judged on their merits and demerits, and transformed from work in an educational manner. For example, Lu Tingzhi, the manager of Chang'an Weiyang Cooperative, has made great achievements in oil extraction in the cooperative, but he has privately borrowed cooperative funds; after pointing out his mistakes and making him compensate, he was still retained as the manager of the cooperative, and his work mood was very good. At the beginning, the cadres and members of the cooperative did not understand this kind of treatment very well, but they agreed after the comrades of the working group explained it.

III. Clearing Assets and Debts.

The old cooperatives in the new districts generally have a history of fifteen or sixteen years, and the shortest has been two or three years. Many cooperatives have increased their shares many times, with cash shares, in-kind shares, paper money, and silver dollars, but they were all apportioned, and some were shared by all farmers in the entire district or township. However, under the conditions of inflation during the enemy and puppet regime, coupled with poor management, incomplete account books, and often no settlement of accounts and disclosure of funds, the existing assets of the cooperatives, and their existing debt-claim relationship, are actually mostly on the books. Therefore, clearing the existing assets, recovering the debts, and determining the equity are important issues in the resumption of operations of the old cooperatives and in the beginning of reorganizing the unrehabilitated cooperatives to enable them to resume operations.

Since the Cooperative Bureau formulated the measures for handling cooperatives in the new districts (including many measures for handling debts and claims), the masses in various places have, under leadership, launched a clearing movement, including the property clearing of unrehabilitated cooperatives, the equity clearing of rehabilitated cooperatives, and the debt clearing. This asset clearing movement, which has been universally launched in various places, has made those who illegally seized property, embezzled public funds, abused their power for personal gain, and engaged in corruption and bribery bow their heads, admit their mistakes to the masses, and compensate for their losses, and has restored part of the masses' credibility to the cooperatives. For example, Guo Yancheng, the manager of the Yongle District Cooperative of Jingtang, forcibly borrowed 777 catties of cotton from the cooperative and has returned it; in Bin County, Baoji, Dali and other districts, some masses have spontaneously cleaned up the original cooperative assets, although there are deviations, but it can prove that it has become a mass movement. The second is to determine the equity and issue stocks. By the end of 1949, about half of the rehabilitated cooperatives had completed this work. For example, the Xiamiao Cooperative and the Central Cooperative (formerly the Beisha Cooperative) in Huaxian County have issued stocks to the members, and the Shemeng, Liuzhi, and Chishui cooperatives are preparing to distribute them. The masses who received the stocks all said, "We haven't seen stocks for many years. If it weren't for the liberation, we would never have this handle." Some said, "Now I know that the shares paid to the cooperative are not donations of public funds." Clearing assets and determining equity have indeed relieved the masses of some concerns about the past cooperatives, and have taken a step forward in their understanding, laying the foundation for future development of members and expansion of shares.

There are also achievements in the handling of debts. First of all, it is reflected in the handling of illegal seizures of cooperative assets, domineering embezzlement, and staff bribery. For example, the power-driven ginning equipment of the Southwest Guan Cooperative of Weinan was robbed by Li Baipeng, the manager of the Xiangfeng Flour Company, a local powerful figure, in 1936 and used by force, and could not be recovered. After liberation, the government approved its clearing of old debts with Li. Li also watched the wind and ruddered, and proposed a repayment plan, expressing his willingness to repay. After both parties agreed, Li Baipeng was responsible for refurbishing a complete set of 16-horsepower power-driven ginning machines for the cooperative, and apologized to the board of directors and supervisors of the cooperative, and the matter was resolved. With the administrative cooperation and the cooperation of the cooperatives in sending people to urge the collection, the foreign debts of cooperatives in various places have also achieved great results in the past six months. However, many cooperatives have collected very little, so that although there are many funds in name, they cannot be fully used. Even some cooperatives in some areas have not recovered a penny. The funds cleared out have not been collected because they have not been strictly urged. Therefore, how to reasonably and timely recover foreign debts is still a very important issue. The better clearing is to follow the mass line and carry it out under leadership, and the results are satisfactory to both parties. For example, Jia Shenglin, the director of the first bao (xiang) cooperative of Zhifang district in Fengxiang, had collected 1,975 yuan of shares from the masses, but because he was illiterate, he only remembered paying 800 yuan of shares to the county cooperative treasury, and could not say where the rest was used. Some masses suspected him of bribery, so they held a meeting to discuss the handling method. On the spot, a member said that the cooperative sent him to receive training and gave him more than 800 yuan and 2 dou 7 sheng of wheat; Jia also remembered how much he donated to the Friends of Wounded Soldiers Society and how much he subscribed to the Cooperative Book Society. After calculating the result, it was only 10 or 20 yuan short. Most of the masses also said that Jia was upright and honest and would not commit bribery, so they handled it this way. This proves that clearing can not only expose bribery personnel, but also identify good people, which is worthy of attention in various places.

IV. Handling Problematic Staff:

In some areas, the handling of corrupt and bribed staff members is very appropriate and has indeed played a great role in the work; especially the handling of those who have done many evils and have committed major bribery has indeed satisfied the wishes of the cooperative members and changed their views on cooperation. It can be said that they have changed from distrust to beginning to trust. This can be seen from the increase in shares in the new cooperatives established this year. For example, the handling of Li Baipeng's illegal seizure of cooperative property in Weinan West Guan Cooperative, especially the old director Chen Weixian (landlord), accountant Dong Jingwen (merchant), secretary Li Zhaobin and scale operator Wang Xihou (both poor peasants) of the Jingyang Dadong District Cooperative (reorganized from the Peasant Association) who collectively embezzled 2,019 catties of cotton and 11 shi of wheat, Chen and Dong have been cleaned out of the cooperative in addition to repaying part of the embezzlement with interest, and Li and Wang have been retained for work after compensation, all showing that since the leadership of the people's democratic government, the past illegal personnel have been given the punishment they deserve, and the cooperative members are very satisfied. However, because the masses are generally disgusted with and hate the reactionary regime, coupled with the inability to understand the internal situation of the cooperative, they suspect that many staff members have committed bribery, and in handling it, they often inevitably show a more serious "left" deviation. That is, the masses' spontaneous liquidation struggle in various places, because of the lack of correct leadership, shows that regardless of whether there are facts or not, they generally only see that the original cooperative funds were very large, why are they now very small or gone, so they ask the original responsible staff to compensate for all of them. For example, a director of the Luobin District Cooperative in Dali was transferred for as long as a year, so he was calculated with the principal (15,000 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 16 shi of wheat) at the time of collecting shares, and he was made to compensate for more than 80 shi of wheat, but in fact he should only be responsible for compensating for 3 shi and 5 dou (due to the devaluation of legal tender). For example, Li Wenquan, the director of the Jinxian District Cooperative in Changwu, privately sold more than 50 old shi of wheat from the cooperative warehouse. When he handed over the money to the cooperative several years later, he could only buy 3 shi of wheat. However, the result of the mass clearing was not mainly to pursue Li's responsibility and make him compensate, but to let 14 staff members compensate for a total of 806 silver dollars according to the amount of remuneration they had previously distributed, the most was 72 yuan and the least was 18 yuan. Those who should be cleared are not cleared, and those who should not be cleared are all cleared together, expanding the scope of attack, which is not in line with the policy. At the same time, similar situations have occurred in various counties and districts in Binzhou, Baoji and other districts, and even bad phenomena such as old staff members compensating for land, livestock, and sharing pork have occurred, causing old staff members to panic and run away, and staff members dare not go to the countryside to work. This all shows that the handling of old cooperative staff members must be very cautious, based on accurate facts, and handled reasonably to ensure the correct clearing work. It is necessary to overcome the current spontaneous and unorganized phenomena of mass leadership in various places, and it should be clear that the purpose of clearing is to quickly resume operations, not to withdraw shares or distribute original shares. Clearing should also prevent private feelings and personal revenge, and resolutely overcome the state of no leadership.

　　如何改造新区旧合作社
    解放后，对于新区有群众基础的旧有合作社应即加以改造，使它迅速复业。陕西关中区，经过各级党政的重视，合作局多次派工作组到各分区各县调查与帮助处理，加上国营经济的配合、协助，已经吸取了初步的，但是极重要的，改造旧社的经验，纠正了工作中存在的偏差。这样、才有可能在现有基础上，有条件的恢复了大部分可以复业的合作社的业务，清理了并正在清理着旧社的资产债务，启发了群众对于合作社的认识，因此使新区合作社旧有面貌开始一新。为什么能获得上述成绩呢？综合起来，有下面几点经验：
    一、代管政策的确定。
    合作局于西安解放之后，因老区所来干部有限，又忙于接收，接管敌伪合作行政及业务机关，忙于教育改造合作机关的旧有干部，虽然也派出少数干部去作典型调查，但以新区情况生疏，工作效果表现不大，当时也没有能够及时地制订关于处理旧社的方针，指示各地，使有所遵循。但是各地政府在这一时期是重视了旧社的处理工作的。表现在渭南分区的渭南、临潼各县，区政府对于旧社调查处理工作，都有相当布置和了解，而且接管了一部分旧社，也作出了恢复、发展合作事业的初步计划。今年之所以有百分之百的县社和百分之四十八的区社及百分之九的乡社复业，主要的是各地政府重视领导与积极管理的结果。但是在处理旧社工作中各地也存在了比较严重的偏差。一种是接收包办，如陇县等地，把合作社的账目家具物件都接收了，充作公有财产，使原有资产散失很多。华县县府要接收北沙社，致该社发生隐匿财产现象，后来旧有职员明白了政府不是没收，才把全部财产公开出来。一种是置诸不理，如大荔分区各县在关中区解放的最早，直到十月间合作局工作组下去时，有些县级政府还不很了解合作社的情况，整理工作陷于停顿状态，致使全区合作社的恢复和发展，数量很少。这种情况，一直继续了半年到一年之久，置诸不理，是领导上忽视了合作社在经建工作中的重要性，是忽视了群众利益；接收包办，是对合作社的群众性认识不足，误把对官僚资产的政策来对合作社。这都是不正确的。只有采取代管政策，使其迅速复业，然后彻底改造，才是唯一正确的方针。半年来的工作经验充分证明了这一点，是可以肯定，不应怀疑的。
    经验证明，各级政府重视对合作事业领导，主动进行并配合上级工作，新区合作社的处理，才能正确，合作社业务才能迅速恢复。否则便很困难。最显著的事实，如宝鸡分区凤翔县区政府非常重视合作社工作，当合作局派遣工作组帮助工作时，便主动配合，郑重地召集会议，周密布置并派得力干部参加工作，工作中又及时地进行检查，因此，该县工作就进行得非常顺利收效也大。反之如该分区的扶风县各级政府，认为合作工作是合作局的责任，自己是帮助工作，只派一位同志参加工作布置，且很草率，因此给工作增加了困难，所以收效不大。
    但是，各县在重视合作社工作中，也存在着偏差。就是说有个别的县级政府把县联社当做一部分机关生产去进行指导，甚至发现抽取赢余等情事。如醴泉县政府在协助贸司供应军队盐碱工作中，阻止了商人包办，帮助恢复并且发展了县供销社，这是很对的；但没有注意到县供销社的群众性，使县供销社的业务未推动区社，来组织群众供销，协助生产，常提取县供销社的盈余来弥补县府开支，因此银行拒绝贷款。周至县政府对县联社领导也很重视，把没收的物资拨给合作社使用，也借款给合作社运用，这是可以的；但是将县联社的门市部当作机关生产经营是不很合适的。其所以产生上述现象的主要原因是在领导上对合作社的群众性（联社也是由各单位合作社员组成的）认识不足，这和机关生产有很大的区别，也与机关合作社不同，把他混为一事，不加区别，会使社员群众产生不良影响。
    二、利用旧职员恢复和发展业务。
    因为新区旧社，一部分还有资产可以使用，很多旧有职员，也可留用工作。因此如何利用原有资产，留用旧有职员，在原有基础上恢复业务，是非常重要的，也是开展新区合作事业的决定因素之一。这样作，可以利用旧摊来为群众服务，可以在复业中鉴定旧有职员，更重要的是使合作社资产完整的保留下来，债权债务迅速清理完毕，并从新的工作中经过团结，教育改造留用职员，以培养新区合作事业广大的下层干部。在这方面有些地方作的很好，收到了相当成效，如长安未央社，三桥社，华县北沙社，下庙社，咸阳北高社等原有经理、职员及理监事主席等一概没有撤换，照旧供职，结果能很快复业，进行供销或生产业务，资产完整保留，债权积极清理，且有些职员思想上较前进步。
    但处理复业和留用旧有人员上，各地是有严重缺点的，如渭南分区临潼县将一部分合作社旧有职员完全撤换了，以致资产债务不能清理，不能很快复业。甚至发生开始撤换，派人代替，后来因工作困难而又叫回来的现象。这一时期中对旧有人员不加区别的处理，是根本的缺点。事实证明，除个别贪污重大，恶霸劣绅，为社员群众愤恨不能改造者，应加清洗出社外，一般的是应分清是非，判别功过，以教育方式，从工作中加以改造。如长安未央社的经理卢廷芝对该社榨油有很大成绩，但他曾私自挪借过社款；经指出他的错误并使之赔偿后，仍留用为该社经理，工作情绪很好。开始社内干部以及社员群众对于这样处理，是不很理解的，但当工作组同志解释后，才同意了。
    三、清理资产债务。
    新区合作社一般的已有十五、六年的历史，最短已有二、三年了。许多社曾增股多次，有现金股、有实物股，有票币、有硬洋，但都是摊派而来，有的是全区全乡农户皆有股金。但在敌伪政权时期通货膨胀的情况下，加之经营不善，账簿不全常不结账与公布资金，于是各社现有资产，及其存在的债务债权关系，实际上多在账面上。因此清理现有资产，索还欠债，确定股权是旧社复业后，及开始整理未复业合作社使之复业中的一个重要问题。
    新区合作社自合作局制订新区合作社处理办法（其中关于债权债务处理办法很多）以后，各地群众已有领导的开展了清理运动，这包括对未复业社的财产清理，已复业社的股权清理，债务清理等。这种各地普遍发动的清理资产运动，已使非法侵占财产，挪用公款，假公济私，贪污舞弊的人员低头，向群众承认错误及赔偿损失，挽回了部分群众对合作社的信誉。如泾汤永乐区社经理郭彦诚强借社内棉花七百七十七斤，已经归还；邠县、宝鸡、大荔等分区，一部分群众已经自发的清理原有社内资产，虽有偏差，但可证明已形成为群众运动。其次是确定股权，制发股票，截至四九年底将此项工作进行完毕者，约占已复业社的半数。如华县下庙社和中心社（原为北沙社）都把股票发给社员了，还有石孟、柳枝、赤水等社正准备分发。领到股票的群众，都说：“多年来就没有见过股票，要不是解放，我们就永远不会有这个执把。”有的说：“现在才知道给合作社缴的股金，不是捐了公款。”清理资产、确定股权，确实对群众解除了对于过去的合作社的部分顾虑，在认识上提高一步，为今后发展社员，扩大股金，打下基础。
    关于债务处理上也是有成绩的。首先表现在对非法侵占合作社资产，恶霸挪用及职员舞弊的处理上。如渭南西南关社的动力轧花设备，被当地当权分子象峰面粉公司经理李百朋于一九三六年武装抢去使用，无法收回，解放后政府准其向李清理旧债，李也看风使舵，提出清偿办法，表示愿意清偿，经双方协议，由李百朋负责给该社装修一部十六匹马力的全套动力轧花机，并向该社理监会认错道歉的条件下解决了。各地合作社的外欠债务，经半年来的行政配合与合作社派人催收，也有很大成效。但也有很多合作社收的很少，以致名义上虽有很多资金，并不能十足运用。甚至部分地区的合作社一点也没有收回。清理出来的款项，也因不严格催收，而收不起来。因此外欠如何合理地、及时地收回，仍是一个很重要的问题。清理比较好的是走群众路线和有领导的进行，结果双方满意。如凤翔纸坊区第一保（乡）社理主贾生林曾收群众股金一、九七五元，因本人不识字，只记得交过县合作金库股金八百元，其余说不出用途。有些群众便怀疑他舞弊，于是便开会研究处理办法，当场有一个社员说社内派他去受训，曾给了八百余元，还有二斗七升麦子；贾又想起给伤兵之友社捐多少，合作图书社认股多少，算到结果，只差一、二十元。多数群众也说贾为人正派老实，不会舞弊，所以便这样处理了。这证明清理不但可以揭发舞弊人员，而且可以鉴别好人，值得各地注意。
    四、对有问题职员的处理：
    在一些地区对于舞弊贪污职员的处理，是很适当的，确实对工作起了很大作用；特别对作恶多端和有重大舞弊人员的处理，也确实满足了社员群众的愿望，使他们对合作的看法改变了，可以说由不信任变为开始信任了，这从今年成立新社增加股金上可以看出来。如渭南西关社对李百朋非法侵占合作社财产案的处理，特别是泾阳大东区社（由农会改组）旧理事长陈维贤（地主）、会计董敬文（商人）、书记李朝斌及司称王希厚（均贫农）等集体贪污棉花二、○一九斤，小麦十一石的处理，现陈董二人除加息偿还贪污一部外，并已清洗出社，李、王二人赔偿后留用工作，都表明在人民民主政府领导以来，对过去不法人员已给了应有的惩处，社员群众是很满意的。但因群众基于一般的对反动政权的厌恶愤恨，加上对于合作社内部情况的无法了解，怀疑许多职员们都有舞弊，在处理时常不免又表现了比较严重的“左”的偏差。这就是各地群众的自发清算斗争，因无正确领导而表现不问有无事实，一般的只看到原来合作社资金很多，为什么现在很少，或没有了，于是就叫原有负责职员全部赔偿。如大荔洛滨区社理主任某因办理移交达一年之久，乃以收股时的股金（一万五千元法币，折麦十六石）复利计算，使其赔偿小麦八十余石，而实际只应负赔偿三石五斗之责（因法币贬值关系）。如长武进贤区社理主李文泉私卖合作社仓麦五○多老石，数年以后将款交社时，只能买三石麦子。但群众清理结果，不是主要的向李追清责任，使之赔偿而是让十四个职员以过去所分酬劳金多少分别赔偿银元共八○六元，最多的七十二元，最少的十八元。应当清理的不清理，不应当清理的一齐进行清理，扩大了打击面，是不合乎政策的。同时邠州、宝鸡等分区各县内，都有类似情况发生，甚至使旧有职员赔偿土地、牲畜、以及分猪吃肉等不良现象发生，致使旧有职员恐慌逃跑，工作人员不敢下乡工作等。这都说明了对旧社职员处理必须非常慎重，有确切事实作根据，合情合理的处理才能保证清理工作正确进行。必须克服目前存在各地的群众自发领导自流现象，而且应明确清理的目的是为迅速复业，不是为退股，分配原有股金，清理时更应防止私情与个人报复，坚决克服无领导状态。
