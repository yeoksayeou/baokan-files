　　Based on the Principle of Considering Both Public and Private Interests
    Hankou Automobile Transportation Industry Should Be Adjusted

To the Editor:

    We are a group of independent laborers in the Hankou automobile transportation industry. We have organized an institution called the "Hankou Private (Editor's Note: 'Private' should be called 'Private') Automobile Joint Transportation Service Cooperative," which has seven service stations, including all private vehicles in the Hankou urban area, totaling more than 460. The general private cars operating in the city are mostly one car per person, or two people partner in one car, one person as the driver, one person as the assistant, and even three or four people partner in one car. Our freight price list is calculated according to the ton-kilometer cost stipulated by the government.

    Before liberation, we suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation from the Kuomintang reactionaries and middlemen and wharf feudal forces who lived by sucking blood, and we were on the verge of death. After the liberation of Hankou, after several months of hard work, we organized the current service cooperative under the leadership of the People's Government and got rid of layers of exploitation. We have fulfilled considerable obligations in supporting the front lines.

    This year, various public transportation units (Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, Jinghan Railway Bureau Automobile Section, Second Field Army, and Fourth Field Army Automobile Team) participated in transportation work. On average, we can only get one load of goods every ten days or so. In addition, our business has become worse recently due to the slack season. We waited anxiously at the service station every day, hoping for a few train wagons, but military and public vehicles swarmed in, not in order of precedence. One military or public vehicle has already made four round trips, and our four vehicles can only get one chance.

    We have reported this situation to the Transportation Department and Trade Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, the Central South District Company of the China Salt Industry Corporation, and the Central South District Company of the China Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Corporation, requesting solutions to our difficulties. However, because there are many public transportation units that do not belong to the same administrative system, appropriate solutions have not been obtained. Therefore, our cars are forced to be dismantled and sold as scrap iron (dozens have already been dismantled) to maintain a living. Many technicians have lost their jobs. If this situation continues, the lives of our 1,000 people (plus nearly 3,000 family members) will be unsustainable. Therefore, we hope that the newspaper will convey this issue to relevant authorities so that the problem can be resolved reasonably and quickly.

    Representatives of all members of the Hankou Private Automobile Joint Transportation Service Cooperative:
    Service Cooperative Leaders Zhou Dadong, Xu Shida, Tian Ruiting, Song Zhiqun
    Station 1 Representative Hu Jiahui, Station 2 Representative Gan Weifan, Station 3 Representative Bi Shouchun, Station 4 Representative Zhou Jianhua
    Station 5 Representative Yi Jinlian, Station 6 Representative Jin Huanzhang, Station 7 Representative Xiong Zhangli

    Editor's Note: Regarding the current situation of the public and private automobile transportation industries in Hankou, it should be reasonably adjusted in accordance with the People's Government's policy of adjusting public and private industries and commerce. It is hoped that the relevant leading organs such as the Transportation Department and Trade Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee will convene representatives from various public and private transportation units for consultation. Based on the actual situation, a reasonable solution should be sought under the principle of appropriately taking care of the private transportation industry.

### 根据公私兼顾的原则  汉口汽车运输业应调整

　　根据公私兼顾的原则
    汉口汽车运输业应调整编辑同志：
    我们是汉口汽车运输业的一群独立劳动者。我们组织了一个机构名叫“汉口民营（编者按：‘民营’应称‘私营’）汽车联合运输服务社”，共有七个服务站，包括汉口全部市区民营车辆共四百六十余部。我们在市内营业的一般民营汽车，绝大多数是一人一部车子，或二人合伙一部车子，一个人当司机，一个人当助手，甚至还有三个人或四个人合伙一部车子的。我们的运货价目是遵照政府规定的吨公里成本计算。
    解放前，我们受尽国民党反动派及靠吸血为生的中间经纪人与码头封建势力的种种压迫和剥削，奄奄一息。汉口解放后，我们经过了几个月的艰苦努力，才组织了现在这个服务社，在人民政府的领导下，摆脱了层层剥削。我们在支援前线的工作中尽了相当的义务。
    本年各个公家运输单位（农垦局、京汉铁路局汽车股、二野及四野汽车队）参加运输工作，平均十天左右才能轮到我们拖上一车货。加以近来营业清淡，我们的业务情况更恶化了。我们每天守在服务站，好容易盼来了几辆火车皮，但军公车辆一拥而至，也不依照先后次序。军公车一部车子已经往返拖了四次，我们四部车子只能摊到一次。
    我们曾到中南军政委员会交通部及贸易部、中国盐业公司中南区公司、中国花纱布公司中南区公司等机关报告这种情况，请求解决我们的困难，但因为公家运输单位很多，不属于同一行政系统，故未能得到适当的解决。因此我们的车子被迫拆散当废铁卖（现在已拆散了几十部），借以维持生活。技术人员很多失了业。如果这种情况继续下去，那末，我们一千个人（加上家属将近三千人）的生活将无法维持。所以我们希望报纸将这个问题转达有关机关，使问题迅速得到合理的解决。
    汉口民营汽车联合运输服务社全体社员代表：
    服务社负责人周大东、徐世达、田瑞庭、宋志群
    一站代表胡家辉  二站代表甘维藩  三站代表毕寿臣  四站代表周建华五站代表易锦连  六站代表金焕章
  七站代表熊章礼
    编者按：关于汉口公、私营汽车运输业的现状，应该根据人民政府调整公私营工商业的方针，加以合理的调整。望中南军政委员会交通部及贸易部等有关领导机关召集公、私营运输业各单位代表进行协商。根据实际情况，在适当照顾私营运输业的原则下求得合理的解决。
