　　【Xinhua News Agency News】Comprehensive reports from the Vietnam News Agency: The Lao and Cambodian People's Liberation Armies have continuously attacked French colonial troops.

　　The Lao People's Liberation Army ambushed a French military supply escort team in northern Laos on May 18th, killing 12 French soldiers and seizing 50 horses and 56 parachutes. In southern Laos, the Liberation Army destroyed several French military strongholds in May. More than ten Lao mercenaries trained by French colonialists surrendered to the Liberation Army in Bassac province. In addition, the Liberation Army seized five French machine guns and forty rifles. At the end of June, the Liberation Army killed 20 French soldiers in a battle with the French army in northern Laos.

　　The Cambodian People's Liberation Army and militias defeated French colonial troops who attacked the Cha (transliteration) area, 100 li north of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, on May 2nd, killing 11 French officers and soldiers. On May 3rd, many Cambodian mercenaries of the French army surrendered to the Cambodian People's Liberation Army in the Kompong Da (transliteration) area, north of Phnom Penh.

　　【Xinhua News Agency, 22nd】TASS Rome, 18th: The Rome newspaper "National Evening News" published a Paris dispatch stating: French military and political figures are greatly alarmed by the predicament that French colonial troops have fallen into. This predicament is the result of the recent advance of the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Due to combat and tropical diseases, the French army is losing three to five hundred men every day. The death rate of officers is particularly high. Some troops, being without officer command, have gone over to the side of the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　Serious losses have demoralized the French army, and they are beginning to voice anti-war sentiments and demand to go home. This sentiment has caused conflicts between soldiers and officers, and five officers have been killed. Due to the huge losses, the French commander in Vietnam is requesting new reinforcements.

    侵越法军损失严重士气低落
    【新华社讯】综合越南通讯社消息：老挝、柬埔寨人民解放军连续出击法国殖民军。
    老挝人民解放军于五月十八日在老挝北部截击一支法军补给护送队，毙法军十二名，并缴获马五十匹、降落伞五十六具。在老挝南部，解放军于五月间先后消灭法军据点多处。法国殖民者训练的老挝雇佣兵十余名在巴萨省向解放军投诚。此外，解放军并缴获法军机枪五挺、步枪四十支。六月底，解放军在老挝北部与法军的一次战斗中，毙法军二十名。
    柬埔寨人民解放军和民兵于五月二日击溃袭击柬埔寨首都——百囊奔以北百里茶（译音）区的法国殖民军，毙法军官兵十一名。五月三日，许多法军的柬埔寨雇佣兵向百囊奔以北公篷达（译音）区的柬埔寨人民解放军投诚。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社罗马十八日讯：罗马《国家晚报》刊载巴黎消息称：法国军政方面人士对于法国殖民军所陷入的困境，大为恐慌。这种困境是由于越南民主共和国军队最近进军的结果。由于战斗和热带疾病，法军每天要死亡三百到五百人。军官的死亡特别多。有些处于没有军官统率状态的部队，都跑到越南民主共和国的军队方面去了。
    严重的损失使得法军的士气低落，他们正在开始发出反战和要求回家的论调。这种论调引起了士兵和军官之间的冲突，已有五名军官被杀。由于巨大的损失，驻越南的法军指挥官正要求新的增援。
