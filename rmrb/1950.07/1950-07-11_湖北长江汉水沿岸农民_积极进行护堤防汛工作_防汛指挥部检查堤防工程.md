Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 9th: Due to the rapid rise in water levels, farmers in areas along the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province, under the unified leadership of the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, are actively engaged in flood control work. In recent days, the water levels of the Yangtze and Han Rivers have risen continuously. The water level of the Yangtze River in Yichang has risen to 51.82 meters, and the water level in Hankou has risen to 23.46 meters. The water levels in these areas have exceeded the flood control level. The water level of the Han River in Baihe has risen to 180.61 meters, and the water level in Xiangyang has risen to 66.57 meters (both calculated with the Wusong water level as the zero point).

In view of the above serious situation, the Middle Reach Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters have urgently telegraphed their respective flood control headquarters along the rivers, ordering them to immediately and comprehensively mobilize flood control personnel to the dykes, prepare materials, and carry out strict protection. The Wuchang County Flood Control Command has formed patrol teams and emergency rescue teams to comprehensively inspect leaks, badger holes, and dangerous projects in various places. According to the results of inspections by the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters between Hankou and Songzi, it was found that there were many places where the dykes were not consolidated, as well as many badger holes and ant nests. In Jianli alone, there were 79 badger holes. The Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has now telegraphed various localities to add 574 projects before the flood season, totaling 720,000 cubic meters of earthwork and more than 2,600 cubic meters of stonework; and to raise 7 million catties of rice, more than 265,000 sacks, 10,000 catties of lead wire, more than 400 cubic meters of rough stones, and other various materials to be distributed to various localities in a timely manner for flood control.

In order to grasp the water situation in a timely manner during the flood season, the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters plans to erect more than 1,300 kilometers of special telephone lines for flood control along the main dyke lines. 374 kilometers have already been completed, and it is expected that all of them will be completed by the middle of the month.

    【新华社汉口九日电】由于水位急速上涨，湖北省沿长江、汉水各地农民在湖北省防汛指挥部统一领导下，正积极进行防汛工作。近日来，长江、汉水水位连续上涨，宜昌长江水位已涨至五一点八二公尺，汉口水位涨至二十三点四六公尺，上述各地水位均已超过防汛水位。汉水上游白河水位涨至一八零点六一公尺，襄阳水位上涨至六六点五七公尺（均以吴淞水位为零点计算）。
    鉴于上述严重情况，长江水利委员会中游局和湖北省防汛指挥部，已急电所属沿江、河各级防汛指挥部，立即全面动员防汛人员上堤，准备好器材，严密进行防护。武昌县防汛指挥机关已组成巡查队、抢险队，普遍检查了漏洞、獾洞和各处险工。据湖北省防汛指挥部在汉口和松滋间检查的结果，发现各堤身不巩固之处和獾洞、蚁穴都很多，仅监利一地即有獾洞七十九处。现该省防汛指挥部已电令各地在汛前加补工程五百七十四处，计土方七十二万余公方，石方二千六百余公方；并筹集防汛经费大米七百万斤，麻袋二十六万五千余条，铅丝一万斤，蛮石四百多公方及其他各种器材，准备及时发放给各地进行防汛。
    湖北省防汛指挥部为了在汛期及时掌握水情，拟在各主要堤线架设防汛专用电话线一千三百余公里，现已完成三百七十四公里，预计月中即可全部架好。
