Literary and Art Groups Employ Diverse Methods to Carry Out Anti-American Aggression Propaganda Activities

[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The National Federation of Literary and Art Circles convened a meeting on propaganda work against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea on the 13th. Representatives from more than ten literary and art groups, including the National Association of Literary Workers, attended. The meeting discussed propaganda content and methods. Various groups launched propaganda activities in Beijing starting on the 19th.

The National Association of Fine Arts has already published a special comic issue on "Opposing American Imperialist Aggression against Taiwan and Korea" in this newspaper and has created dozens of slogan lantern slides to be shown in various cinemas.

The National Quyi Artists Association performed new Quyi programs to coordinate with the evening performances held by various groups and organized a new Quyi experimental mobile team that departed from Beijing on the 19th, traveling south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, performing or organizing evening performances in various places along the way. The target audience was railway workers, passengers, and the general public. They also combined singing with speeches to launch a peace signature campaign.

The 21st issue of the "Literary Gazette" published a special issue against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. In an article titled "More Ugly Than a Puppet," Guo Moruo denounced the American warmongers, saying: "...They thought that invading Korea would show off their power, but they were beaten by Korea into a state of utter chaos. If MacArthur, Acheson, and their ilk still had any sense of shame, they should have jumped off a building earlier to follow Forrest." Mao Dun, in an article titled "Aggressors Reap What They Sow," said: "The Chinese people and the people of the world have clearly expressed: World peace cannot be disrupted, and we have the determination to defend peace! We are also prepared to punish those who disrupt peace. If the warmongers regard the people as easy to deceive and act perversely, refusing to wake up until their death, then they will reap what they sow!" In addition, there are articles by Ye Shengtao, Ma Fantu, Yu Pingbo, Zang Kejia, Bian Zhilin, Li Helin, and others, as well as a cartoon by Cai Ruohong. The "People's Literature" to be published on "August 1st" will include Guo Moruo's work "Ghost Faces Cannot Scare People," Ai Qing's poem "Asian People, Arise!", Zhao Shuli's "Truman's Cultural Level," and Tian Jian's poem "To the Korean People," etc. The lyrics of poet Ai Qing's "Forward! Glorious People's Army!", Lü Jian's "Korean People's War Song," Yan Chen's "Oppose the War of Aggression," Wang Yaping's "Korean People's Victory Song," etc., were jointly composed by the National Musicians Association, the People's Art Theatre, and the Youth Art Theatre, and were successively published in the People's Daily. Since the 19th, the China Youth Art Theatre has arranged a forum, two propaganda evenings, and two street propaganda activities, dispatching more than 200 people to the east and south of Beijing to promote the true face of American imperialism as a paper tiger to the broad masses of the people through diverse literary and artistic propaganda methods such as speeches, cartoons, and costumed performances.
