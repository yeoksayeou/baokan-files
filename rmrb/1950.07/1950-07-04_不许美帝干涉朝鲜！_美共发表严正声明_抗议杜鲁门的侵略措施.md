　　No U.S. Imperialism Allowed to Interfere in Korea!
    Communist Party USA Issues a Solemn Statement
    Protesting Truman's Aggressive Measures
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd] TASS, New York, 3rd: The National Committee of the Communist Party USA issued the following statement regarding Truman's order of June 30th to send US ground troops to Korea and the order for the Air Force to bomb North Korea. The statement stated: "Every American who cherishes his own life and the lives of all mankind should strongly protest to Truman and Congress against the measures taken on June 30th.
    All peace-loving Americans, especially workers and Black people, should make July 4th a day of full mobilization of the people to get millions of people to sign the Stockholm World Peace Appeal.
    No interference in Korea. Not a single person, a single gun, a single plane for mass murder. International agreements prohibit atomic and hydrogen bombs."
