To strengthen the political and professional learning of in-service teachers in public and private primary and secondary schools, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Education Bureau has decided to establish the "Wuhan Summer Institute." It is divided into four departments: Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Vocational Education, and Arts and Literature. It also includes a Youth Academy and a Children's Academy to organize youth and children's learning. The study period is scheduled from July 17 to August 13. The learning content is divided into policy study and professional study. Policy study focuses on land reform policy and industrial and commercial policies. The learning methods for theoretical policies include lectures (inviting heads of various agencies to give thematic reports), self-study, group discussions, and summary reports. For professional studies, groups will be formed according to the nature of the profession, and each group will formulate a study plan under the leadership of the educational administration to conduct collective research, mutual teaching, and common learning. At the end of the study, democratic appraisals will be conducted to assess the learning outcomes.
