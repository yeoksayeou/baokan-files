We Will Strive to Become Your Correspondents!
Letter from Liu Weisheng, Yongchun County, Guangxi

To the Editorial Staff:

　　We have received the "People's Daily Communication" you sent us. We have gained another mentor in our studies!

　　Our reading group was established on June 5th. We have encountered some difficulties in our professional work. For example, some of the work experience from the old liberated areas cannot be applied rigidly in the new areas because the situations are entirely new. Coming south for a year has been a new experience for us. At this time, the People's Daily has provided us with assistance and guidance, the value of which is incalculable. When we see the People's Daily, it is as if we see our leader, Chairman Mao. Because his words guide us and strengthen our confidence in completing our work tasks. All of this is so dear to us!

　　This copy of the People's Daily has not only been seen by the comrades in our group, but we have also introduced it to the Public Security Bureau, as well as the county government, tax bureau, and bank.

　　Because there are very few People's Daily subscribers here, we are both mobilizing various organizations and businesses to subscribe. In addition, we plan to post each newspaper at the city's reading area after we have finished reading it, so that it can meet with the vast people of Yongchun.

　　We have not yet been able to write articles for you, but several of our comrades have already become correspondents for the Guangxi Daily. We will strive to become correspondents for the People's Daily.

　　With respect!
                      Nanning Special District, Guangxi Province
                      Yongchun County Public Security Bureau  Liu Weisheng

　　我们要努力争取做你们的通讯员！
    广西永淳县刘蔚生来信编辑同志：
    你们转来“人民日报通讯”我们收到了。我们又多了一个学习上的导师！
    我们的读报小组是于六月五日成立的。我们在业务工作上曾碰到某些困难，如有些老区的工作经验，到新区后因情况全是新的，不能生硬地搬用。南下一年来，对我们是个新锻炼。就在这时候，人民日报给我们以帮助、指导，其价值是无法计算的。我们看到了人民日报，就如同看到了自己的领袖毛主席。因为他的话，指导了我们，加强我们完成工作任务的信心。这一切对我们是多么亲切啊！
    我们这份人民日报，不但和我们小组的同志见了面，而且我们又将它介绍到公安局以及县政府、税务局、银行各部门。
    因为这里人民日报订户很少，我们就一面发动各机关、商户订阅；另外，我们准备在每份报纸看完以后，将它贴在城里的阅报处，使它和永淳广大人民见面。
    我们还没能给你们写稿，但我们几位同志已成为广西日报的通讯员了。我们要努力争取成为人民日报的通讯员。         
          此致敬礼！
                      广西省南宁专区
                      永淳县公安局    刘蔚生
