　　Military Weaknesses of U.S. Imperialism
    —Abstract of Wilner's Essay on "American Strategy"—
    Jing
    The American military commentator Wilner recently published a series of essays in the New York *Compass* examining American strategy. These essays point out the military confusion arising from America's extravagant intentions to pursue world hegemony. From his insightful military analysis, we can clearly see the fundamental weaknesses that exist in the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American imperialism.
    In his article "The Illusion of a Cheap Army," Wilner sharply criticized the erroneous view held by spokesmen of the U.S. Department of Defense, who rashly believe that the use of new army weapons can provide new opportunities for the defense of Western Europe. He pointed out that the U.S. military authorities want to use a set of land defense weapons to support the military foundation of the Atlantic Pact. This effort is bound to fail because it ignores the requirements and realities of modern land strategy. He said, "These weapons are mines, improved anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, rocket launchers with short-range fuses, and other land-based rockets. With the exception of mines, these weapons are basically small-caliber armor-piercing guns, which have only a moderate and auxiliary role in modern warfare. Compared with the firepower and striking power of modern large armies, these weapons are significantly weaker. Faced with the combined power of modern artillery, air force, tanks, and infantry, these weapons will inevitably be helplessly defeated by firepower and army mobility.
    "Western military leaders are clearly behind the reality of modern land warfare. Modern land defense requires the use of a variety of weapons. It is not an action using a few specialized defense weapons. In modern warfare, it is not anti-tank guns fighting tanks, but one army fighting another, using all their defensive and offensive weapons.
    "Land defense weapons, even the best and most modern, have not achieved a strategic revolution. Nor can a new strategy be built around these weapons. No land defense weapon can provide a decisive defensive opportunity. Effective defense cannot be implemented without establishing a defense in depth, and effective defense cannot be implemented without a strong army.
    "Nothing can replace a modern army to defend Western Europe: neither atomic bombs, air power, nor land defense weapons can provide a shortcut."
    In his article "The Myth of Collective Forces," Wilner criticized Acheson's new allied strategy brought back from the London Three Foreign Ministers Conference, namely the "collective balanced forces" plan hailed as the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact military plan. He said, "The military essence of this plan lies in: the United States provides super weapons, France provides ground troops, and the American atomic bomb and the French army are combined into a strategic combination.
    "The entire attacking force of the Atlantic Alliance is based on only one weapon of a single country (the American atomic bomb). The London Conference plan is also fraught with danger for the United States.
    "However, the atomic strategy of the London Conference poses a greater threat to Britain and France than to us. The strategy signed by these two countries in London is what they fear most. Just a few days ago, British atomic scientists confirmed what prominent British experts had said before: Britain cannot withstand an atomic attack. As for France, its critical predicament has been vividly illustrated by General Chassin in *National Defense Magazine*: If France rises up to resist, it will first be attacked by Soviet atomic bombs and then occupied by Soviet troops. But if it does not resist, it will first be occupied by Soviet troops and then attacked by American atomic bombs. Obviously, the planned collective balanced forces of the London Conference will not scare the Soviet Union—the Soviet Union has effective defenses against atomic attacks. But it puts Britain and France in a state of panic and paralysis because they cannot prevent themselves from being hit by atomic bombs.
    "The second serious miscalculation in the London Three Foreign Ministers Conference plan is the absurdly unrealistic reliance on the French army. The French ground forces are the weakest link in the Atlantic Alliance. The French army is now greatly weakened compared to 1940, and it is now hardly stronger than the Belgian army in 1940.
    "The solutions of the London Conference are all illusory. The non-military enormous destructiveness of the American atomic bomb, combined with France's absolute and hopelessly military incompetence, cannot produce any balanced force."
    In his article "The Cost and Risks of Modern Warfare," Wilner pointed out a dangerous practice in the United States, namely, a lot of talk about super weapons, but neglecting the cost and risks of modern warfare. He said, "The cost of World War II was approximately two trillion dollars and fifty million lives. The cost of World War II was five times greater than that of World War I. In fact, it was much more than that. World War II showed that the risks of war are not only the destruction of material and manpower. War brings social disasters and political disconnections. The creators of the Atlantic Pact still do not understand: after World War II, France and Britain are no longer military powers.
    "Why can't Americans see clearly and underestimate the fierce nature of modern warfare and its costs and risks? There is a very important reason for this. During World War II, we had an unparalleled advantage among the belligerent countries. At that time, we had absolute security. At that time, the United States was not threatened by air raids and blockades, material destruction, and the annihilation of troops. As General Marshall's report said, we were defended by 28 million Russian and Chinese soldiers in combat.
    "This advantage of the United States is gone forever. As the Army Department newspaper said as early as 1947, atomic bombs, super technology, and a whole set of super weapons are now endangering the security of the United States. War now means a terrible threat to the continental United States, to our industrial areas, and to our civilians."
    In his article "On New Weapons," Wilner shattered the American fantasy about new weapons. He cited two weapons announced by Army Chief of Staff Collins, anti-aircraft rockets and anti-tank weapons, as examples, saying, "The matter of anti-aircraft rockets is particularly interesting. Flying high and fast, with extremely high hit rates, it may become the main weapon of modern air defense. This anti-aircraft rocket cannot give us complete air security, and in an atomic air war, it cannot prevent terrible material destruction and high casualties.
    "But the progress of anti-aircraft rockets also has another side. The strengthening of American air defense means the weakening of America's aerial atomic offensive capability. What American air defense can do, Soviet air defense can also do. This modernized anti-aircraft rocket has also increased air security for Moscow, Baku, and the Urals. The new anti-aircraft weapons mean a blow to our air force's strategic concept.
    "Our air force is trapped in the idea that modern super weapons are just a set of toys that serve atomic bombs. In fact, various super weapons do different things. There is an air defense composed of super weapons for dealing with long-range bombers carrying atomic bombs, a super air defense composed of jet planes, anti-aircraft rockets, and radar-controlled anti-aircraft guns. The B-36 is not a super weapon; it is an outdated and rather slow aircraft with poor maneuverability. Thus, the American designers of anti-aircraft rockets have proved that atomic bombers cannot become a decisive weapon against the Soviet Union.
    "For many years, our army has been asking for an anti-tank weapon with greater mobility, stronger armor-piercing power, and longer range, and now it may have been obtained (General Collins did not hint at the style of this new anti-tank weapon). However, no weapon can solve the entire task of anti-tank defense alone.
    "In the German-Soviet war, the entire Soviet army and air force fought as an anti-tank force. All calibers of artillery, special mobile anti-tank guns, automatic guns (so-called tank destroyer guns), specialized anti-tank air force, infantry holding their own anti-tank weapons, and finally the tanks themselves—all of these fought against German tanks. This is why the German tank offensive was stopped and the German tank units were destroyed.
    "On the other hand, in the offensive, all Soviet weapons supported the tanks. Soviet tanks never fought alone. Before the tanks fought, there was shelling by artillery and air force, and the tanks were supported by mechanized artillery and motorized infantry, followed by large groups of infantry and artillery.
    "We are following the outdated British concept of isolated duels between anti-tank weapons and tank units. This highly unrealistic idea comes from the illusion of limited warfare, which is now as outdated as medieval knights jousting.
    "The exercises in North Carolina showed another American illusion—the illusion of the strategic role of airborne troops. Airborne troops operations have become our national hobby. However, it is difficult to transport two divisions of people with all the transport aircraft available in the United States. Ground troops are not strengthened because they are transported from the sky; on the contrary, their weakness is increased due to the extra difficulty of supply. Airborne troops cannot replace large armies: they cannot jump over oceans and straits; they cannot be used as tools of global strategy; nor can they rescue and save weak allies."
    In his article "American Military Confusion," Wilner pointed out that America's military policy is still a mystery. He said: "Our own military experts are showing Hamlet-like hesitation and doubt. Military leaders admit that, according to our military policy, a military budget of 13 billion to 15 billion is the maximum limit. But with a military budget of 13 billion to 15 billion US dollars, we can only expect to have one armored division. It is clear that only one armored division cannot compete with the Soviet army, nor can it besiege the Soviet Union, nor can it defend the Western allies. This situation is precisely in accordance with the line of our military policy, which gives priority to the aerial atomic strategy and reduces ground forces to a minimum.
    "Our military policy is burdened with the aerial atomic strategy, so it can only be contradictory and incoherent, and the highest military leaders themselves will have doubts whenever they encounter decisions made in this direction. General Bradley has already approved the priority of the aerial atomic strategy, but he also warned us that 'Our greatest danger is to be taken over by futuristic fantasies and to engage ourselves in unbalanced military forces.' Of course, he is saying that the air force and super-technical equipment will further weaken the army. Very realistically, General Bradley believes that the air force does not have the long-term ability to promote a decisive battle, and that atomic bombs are not omnipotent and cannot guarantee a quick victory.
    "Because the atomic bomb has proved to be a huge disruptor in our strategy, our military strategy is being forced into chaos. The navy, atomic scientists, and army leaders have all issued warnings against the air force's atomic strategic concept. The military arguments against the atomic strategy are overwhelmingly: the atomic bomb cannot defeat the expansion of the Soviet bloc to the two continents; it cannot stop the Soviet army; and in a war involving an atomic duel, the United States would be at a disadvantage because it is more vulnerable to attack. In the long run, the atomic strategy cannot dominate in the face of opposition from those who oppose the atomic bomb.
    "Senator McMahon authoritatively and convincingly confirmed that atomic policy is extremely costly. He bluntly said that the atomic arms race is 'playing jokes with the desire for a balanced national budget.' He insisted: 'Ten or fifteen years of serious cold war will cost us as much as World War II.'"

　　美国帝国主义的军事弱点
    —威尔纳关于“美国战略”的论文节要—
    静
    美国军事评论家威尔纳近在纽约《指南针日报》上连续发表了几篇检讨美国战略的论文。其中指出美国在追求世界霸权的狂妄意图中间所发生的军事方面的混乱情况。从他所作的一些深刻的军事分析中间，我们可以清楚地看出外强中干的美国帝国主义在军事方面存在着怎样的基本弱点。
    威尔纳在《廉价陆军的幻景》一文中，尖锐地批判了美国国防部发言人所抱的一种错误见解，就是轻率认为运用陆军新武器可使西欧防御得到新机会。他指出美国军事当局要用一套陆地防御武器来支持大西洋公约的军事基础。这种努力是一定会失败的，因为它忽视了现代陆地战略的要求和实际情形。他说“这些武器是地雷、改良的反坦克炮、无后坐力的枪、火箭炮短距离信管、以及其他陆地用火箭。除了地雷以外，这些武器在基本上都属于小口径穿甲炮一类，在现代战争中，只有中等的和辅助的作用。和现代庞大军队的火力和打击力相比较，这些武器是很显著地弱小的。面临着现代炮兵、空军、坦克、和步兵的联合威力，这些武器一定会毫无办法地被火力和军队的机动性所战胜。
    “西方的军事领袖，很明显的落在现代陆地战争的现实情况的后面。现代的陆地防御，是需要运用各色各样的武器的防御。它不是用少数专门防御武器的行动。在现代战争中，不是战防炮和战车作战，而是一支军队和另一支军队，运用它们所有一切防御和进攻的武器来作战。
    “陆地防御武器，那怕是最好的和最现代化的，也没有取得战略上的革命。而且也决不能围绕着这些武器建立一种新的战略。任何陆地防御武器，都不能提供具有决定性的防御机会。如果不能够建立纵深防线，就不能实行有效的防御，如果没有一支强大的军队，也就不能实行有效的防御。
    “没有东西可以代替现代的陆军，来防御西欧的：原子弹、空军力量、或陆地防御武器，都不能提供捷径。”
    在《集体部队的神话》一文中威尔纳批判了艾奇逊从伦敦三外长会议带回来的盟国战略新方案，就是被誉为大西洋公约军事计划的定论的“集体平衡部队”方案。他说“这个方案的军事要旨在于：美国拿出超级武器，法国拿出地面部队，把美国原子弹和法国陆军结成一个战略组合。
    “大西洋联盟的全部攻击力量，仅以一个国家的单独一件武器（美国的原子弹）为基础。伦敦会议的计划对美国说来，也就是充满了危险的。
    “但是，伦敦会议的原子战略给予英国和法国的威胁，比给予我们的威胁还大。这两国在伦敦所签订的战略就是他们最惧怕的。仅在几天之前，英国原子科学家们证实了英国著名专家门以前说过的话：英国无法抵挡原子攻击。至于法国，它的危急的困境，已经由沙桑将军在《国防杂志》里形象化地说明了：假如法国起而抵抗，它将先受到苏联原子弹的袭击，然后被苏军占领。但是假如它不抵抗的话，它将先被苏军占领，然后受美国原子弹的袭击。显然地，伦敦会议拟议的集体平衡部队的计划，决不会把苏联吓倒——苏联对原子攻击有着有效的防御。但是它却使英国和法国陷于惊恐和瘫痪，因为他们无法防止自己吃原子弹。
    “伦敦三外长会议计划中第二个严重的错误估计，就是对于法国陆军荒诞地不切实际的依赖。法国地面部队是大西洋联盟中最弱的一环。法国陆军目前比一九四○年时大大减弱，它现在几乎不比一九四○年的比利时军队更强。
    “伦敦会议的解决办法，都是玄虚的。美国原子弹非军事性的巨大破坏性，和法国在军事上之绝对的、无可救药的无能加在一起，并不能产生任何平衡力量”。
    在《现代战争的代价和风险》一文中，威尔纳指出美国国内的一套危险的做法。就是关于超级武器的空谈很多，可是忽略了关于近代战争的代价和风险。他说，“第二次世界大战的代价，约为二万亿美元，和五千万条人命。第二次大战的代价，要比第一次大战大五倍。其实早就不止那么大了。第二次世界大战显示，战争的风险不仅在于物力和人力的毁灭。战争带来了社会的灾难和政治的脱节状态。大西洋公约的缔造者们仍然没有明白：在第二次世界大战之后，法国和英国已经不是军事强国了。
    “何以美国人会看不清楚和过低估计现代战争凶猛的性质及其代价与风险？其中有一个很重要的原因。第二次大战时，在各交战国中，我们据有无比的有利地位。当时我们确有绝对的安全。当时美国没有受到空袭和封锁，物质破坏和军队的全军覆没等威胁，正如马歇尔将军报告所说，我们是由战斗中的两千八百万俄国和中国士兵保卫着的。
    “美国的这种有利地位，已经是一去不复返了。正如陆军部报纸早在一九四七年就说过的，原子弹，超级技术，整套的超级武器现在正转而危及美国的安全。战争对于大陆的美国，对于我们的工业区和我们的平民来说，现在意味着一种可怕的威胁。”
    在《论新式武器》一文中威尔纳打破了美国人对新式武器的幻想。他引陆军参谋总长柯林斯所宣布的两种武器，防空火箭和反坦克武器，作例说“防空火箭的事情特别有意思。飞得又高又快，又有极高的命中率，它或将成为近代空防的主要武器。这种防空火箭不能给我们以全部的空中安全，在空中原子战争中，它不能防止可怕的物质破坏和高度伤亡。
    “可是防空火箭的进展还有它另外的一面。美国空防的增强，就意味着美国的空中原子进攻能力的削弱，美国空防所能做到的，苏联空防也能做到。这种近代化的防空火箭给莫斯科，巴库与乌拉尔也增加了空中安全。新的防空武器，对于我们空军的战略概念来说，就意味着是一种打击。
    “我们的空军陷入一种想法，认为近代超级武器只是一套顽意儿，都是为原子弹而服务的。其实各种超级武器干着不同的事情。对付远程轰炸机所载负的原子弹有超级武器构成的空防，喷气飞机、高射火箭与雷达操纵的高射炮构成的超级空防。Ｂ—３６并不是超级武器；它是一种设计得陈旧的、相当慢的飞机，机动性又差。这样，高射火箭的美国设计者们就证明了原子轰炸机不能成为对付苏联的决定性的武器。
    “多年以来，我们的陆军要求一种活动能力较大、穿甲力较强、射程较远的反坦克武器，现在或者是搞到了吧（柯林斯将军对这新式反坦克武器的式样并无暗示）可是，并没有一种武器能够单独解决反坦克防御的全部任务。
    “在德苏战争中，苏联全部陆军与空军是当作反坦克队伍而作战的。各种口径的大炮，特种的活动的反坦克炮，自动炮（所谓坦克毁灭炮），反坦克的专门空军，持有他们自己反坦克武器的步兵，最后还有坦克本身——所有这些，都跟德国坦克作战。这就是德国坦克攻势被阻止、德国坦克部队被摧毁的道理。
    “另一方面，在进攻的时候，苏联全部武器支持着坦克。苏联坦克从来没有单独作战。坦克作战之前，有大炮和空军的轰击，坦克由机械化炮兵和摩托化步兵支持着，后面跟着大队步兵和炮兵。
    “我们正在追随过了时的反坦克武器与坦克队之间的孤立的决斗的英国概念。这种高度不现实的想法，来自战争局限性的幻景，现在就像中世纪武士们比武一样地过了时。
    “在北卡罗林纳的演习，表现了美国的另一种错觉——对于空运部队的战略作用的错觉。空运部队作战，已经成了我们全国的嗜好了。但是，在美国可用的全部运输机，很难运送两师人。地面部队并不因为从天空运过去，就加强了；相反地，由于补给格外困难，倒更增加了弱点。空运部队不能代替大批陆军：他们不能跳过海洋和海峡；他们不能作为全球战略的工具；他们也不能解救和拯救孱弱的盟国。”
    在《美国军事上的混乱》一文中，威尔纳指出美国的军事政策还是一个谜。他说：“我们的军事专家们自己，表现着汉姆雷特似的犹豫不决和疑虑。军事领袖们承认，按照我们的军事政策，一百三十亿到一百五十亿的军事预算就是最高限度。可是有了一百三十亿到一百五十亿美元的军事预算，我们只能指望有一个装甲师。很清楚地，只有一个装甲师不能与苏军相抗衡，也不能围困苏联，也不能保卫西方盟国。这种情况恰恰是依照我们军事政策的路线的，这个政策把优先权给予空中原子战略，并且把地面部队缩减到最小限度。
    “我们的军事政策肩负着空中原子战略这个包袱，就只能是前后矛盾和不连贯的，每逢遇到按照这方向做决定的时候，最高军事领导者本人都会发生疑虑的问题。布莱德雷将军是已经赞成了空中原子战略的优先地位的，但他又警告我们‘我们的最大危险，是给未来主义的幻想所掌握，而使我们自己从事于不平衡的军事力量。’当然，他说的是空军与超级技术装备，会进一步削弱陆军。很现实地，布莱德雷将军认为空军并没有可以促成决战的长期持续的能力，而原子弹亦非万能，也不能保证速胜。
    “因为原子弹已经证明是我们战略中的一个巨大的破坏者，所以我们的军略正被迫陷入混乱。海军，原子科学家，陆军领导者，都提出警告，反对空军的原子战略概念。军事上反对原子战略的论点是占压倒优势的：原子弹不能击败苏联集团向两个大陆的伸张；它不能阻挡苏军；并且在一个包含原子决斗的战争中，美国会处在不利地位，因为它更易遭受攻击。从长远看来，原子战略在反对原子弹的人们的反对下，是不能占优势的。
    “参议员麦克马洪权威地并且令人心服地证实，原子政策是极其耗费金钱的。他直率地说，原子武装竞赛是在‘跟平衡国家预算的愿望开玩笑’。他坚称：‘十年或十五年严重的冷战叫我们花的钱，会跟第二次大战一样多。’”
