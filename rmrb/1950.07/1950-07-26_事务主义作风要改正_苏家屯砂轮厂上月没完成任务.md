　　Bureaucratic Work Style Must Be Corrected
    Sujiatun Abrasive Wheel Factory Failed to Meet Task Last Month
    [This newspaper, Shenyang] The Sujiatun Abrasive Wheel Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau failed to complete its production tasks in June. The original plan for June was to produce 30 tons of abrasive wheels, but the actual output was 25 tons; the original plan for oilstones was to produce 5 tons, but the actual output was 1.5 tons; the original plan for abrasive cloth was to produce 5,000 dozens, but the actual output was just over 2,000 dozens. The main reasons why the factory failed to meet its targets last month are as follows:
    (1) Although the factory's main raw material, silicon carbide, has been initially successfully test-produced, it cannot be produced in large quantities due to equipment limitations. Therefore, it still relies on the allocation of the Machinery Bureau. Often, the failure to supply raw materials in a timely manner affects production. According to statistics on the 1st of this month, only five of the ten kilns had raw materials. If the raw material problem is not resolved, it will still affect the completion of production tasks in the future.
    (2) Engineers are trapped in a bureaucratic circle and cannot go deep into the field to help workers solve production problems, thus increasing production difficulties and even causing production losses. For example, because No. 3 kiln was sealed ten hours early, more than four tons of abrasive wheels (accounting for three-quarters of the kiln's total output) were not hard enough due to insufficient heat and needed to be completely reworked.
    (3) The factory's leading cadres are busy with daily affairs and have failed to distinguish between the important and the unimportant, and failed to grasp the key issues in production, which is also one of the main reasons for failing to complete the task. In addition, the factory does not pay enough attention to security work, and the problems raised in the review that need to be solved in a timely manner have not been properly resolved, which also affects the workers' production enthusiasm. In response to the above shortcomings, the factory's leading cadres have conducted a review and are now working to improve their work.

　　事务主义作风要改正
    苏家屯砂轮厂上月没完成任务
    【本报沈阳讯】东北机械局苏家屯砂轮厂，六月份各项生产均未完成任务。六月份原计划生产砂轮三十吨，实产二十五吨；油石原计划生产五吨，实产一点五吨；砂布原计划生产五千打，实产两千多打。该厂上月没有完成任务的主要原因，有以下几点：
    （一）该厂的主要原料金钢砂虽已初步试炼成功，但因设备所限，还不能大量生产，因此仍然依靠机械局调拨，往往因原料不能及时供给，便影响生产。据本月一日统计：在十座窑中，只有五座窑有原料。原料问题如不得到解决，对今后完成生产任务仍有影响。
    （二）工程师陷入事务主义的圈子，不能深入现场，具体帮助工友解决生产上的问题，因而增加了生产困难，甚至使生产遭受损失。如三号窑因为提前封窑十小时，使四吨多砂轮（占该窑总量的四分之三）因火力不足，硬度不够，需要全部反工。
    （三）该厂的领导干部忙于日常事务，未能分别轻重，掌握住生产中的关键问题，也是未能完成任务的主要原因之一。加之该厂对保安工作重视不够，复查中所提出来需要及时解决的问题，未予以适当解决，也影响了工友们的生产情绪。针对以上缺点，该厂领导干部已进行检讨，现正着手改进工作。
