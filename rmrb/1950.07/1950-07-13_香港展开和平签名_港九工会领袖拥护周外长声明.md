Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 7th: Hong Kong News: The peace signature campaign among people from all walks of life in Hong Kong has been enthusiastically underway since it began in late June. Leaders of the 54 trade unions under the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions have all signed at the peace signature symposium. They unanimously agreed at the meeting that the memory of Chinese workers in Hong Kong being abused and massacred by the Japanese invaders during World War II is still fresh in their minds. Therefore, they called on 100,000 workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon to participate in the peace signature campaign and resolutely defend world peace. At the same time, they severely condemned Truman's aggressive statement and expressed their unanimous support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on June 28. More than 600 educators have already signed, and 138 people from cultural circles have signed. People from other circles such as business, industry, lawyers, engineers and others have also signed one after another. Signature stations have been set up in eight large bookstores, and Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po receive a large number of readers' signatures every day.
