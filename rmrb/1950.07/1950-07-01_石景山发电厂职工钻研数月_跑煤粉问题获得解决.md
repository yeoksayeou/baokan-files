　　Shijingshan Power Plant Workers Solve After Months of Research
    Coal Dust Problem Resolved

    [This newspaper dispatch] The entire staff of the Shijingshan Power Plant solved the problem of coal dust leakage at the plant on June 20. This will save approximately 1,140,000 catties of millet per year and greatly improve the environmental sanitation of the plant and its vicinity. The plant administration has now decided to award the workers who solved the coal dust problem with 40,000 catties of millet.

    Since the plant began using pulverized coal furnaces in 1946, at least five tons of coal dust were emitted daily. Shijingshan was shrouded in coal dust every day, which not only seriously affected the health of workers and nearby residents but also damaged various machines. This year, in March, a 3,000-kilowatt transformer was burned down because the magnetic bottles and the outer skin of the transformer were covered with coal dust, which caught fire when it touched a wire. In addition, the plant's magnetic bottles frequently sparked, and machines and motors often malfunctioned, all related to the coal dust problem.

    Last May, Du Hongchang, a Communist Party member and pulverized coal furnace worker, first made a suggestion. This May, the plant's Communist Party General Branch and the trade union called on all employees to solve this problem before "July 1" as a gift to the great birthday of the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, all the employees of the plant used their brains and worked towards this direction, and the workers put forward more than 40 suggestions related to coal dust leakage. With the joint efforts of all employees and the specific help of Soviet experts, the plant first improved the coal grinding equipment system, implemented closed-loop operation, eliminated the short-circuit circulation phenomenon, and reduced the amount of dust leakage. Second, the ball load of the coal mill was increased from 15 tons to the standard 24 tons, the ball diameter types were redefined, and a regular replenishment system was established. As a result, the coal grinding capacity increased from 7 tons per hour to 10.5 tons, and the fineness of the pulverized coal also increased to 80% passing through a 200-mesh sieve (previously only 20%). Moreover, because the amount of coal grinding has increased, the cold air intrusion doors can be closed for a longer time, so the amount of dust leakage is also reduced. Third, the furnace inlet pipe of Furnace No. 17 was modified to send the leaked coal dust into the furnace for combustion.

### 石景山发电厂职工钻研数月  跑煤粉问题获得解决

　　石景山发电厂职工钻研数月
    跑煤粉问题获得解决
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂全体职工，已在六月二十日解决了该厂跑煤粉的问题。每年可节省约一百一十四万多斤小米，而且大大地改善了该厂以及该厂附近的环境卫生。现在该厂行政上已决定以四万斤小米，奖励解决跑煤粉问题的职工。
    从一九四六年该厂使用煤粉炉起，每天至少要跑煤粉五吨。石景山周围就每天被煤粉所笼罩，不只严重地影响了工人和附近居民的健康，而且损伤了各种机器。今年三月该厂烧毁了一台三千千瓦的变压器，就因为磁瓶和变压器外皮落满了煤粉，碰到一根铁丝而着了火。此外，该厂磁瓶也经常冒火，机器和马达经常发生故障，都和跑煤粉问题有关。
    去年五月，共产党员、煤粉炉工人杜鸿昌首先提出建议，今年五月里该厂中共总支和工会又号召全体职工，在“七一”前解决这个问题，作为向中国共产党伟大生日的献礼。当时全厂职工都开动了脑筋，向这个方向努力，工人前后提出四十多件有关跑煤粉的建议。在全体职工共同努力，和苏联专家的具体帮助下，该厂首先是改善磨煤设备系统，实行密闭循环运行，除去了短络循环现象，减低了跑粉量。第二、将磨煤机的装球量从十五吨提高到标准量的二十四吨，重新规定球径种类，建立了定时补添制度。结果，磨煤量从每小时七吨提高到十吨半，煤粉细度也提高到百分之八十能通过二百号筛子（以前只有百分之二十）。而且因为磨煤量增多了，可以将冷气侵入门多关些时候，所以跑粉量也少了。第三、改装十七号炉入炉管，将跑出的煤粉，送入炉里燃烧。
