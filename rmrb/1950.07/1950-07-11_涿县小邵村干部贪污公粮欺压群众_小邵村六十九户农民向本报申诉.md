Comrade Editor:

We are farmers from Xiaoshao Village, Seventh District, Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have been liberated and are happily working hard to produce. However, Zhang Wensheng, the militia captain of our village, Wei Liang, the security officer, and Lang Zhaoqi, the former village chief, have embezzled public grain and oppressed the masses, greatly dampening the production enthusiasm of the masses. Last month, our poor and middle peasants sent representatives to the Zhuoxian County government to request a thorough investigation and prosecution, but we have not received a response to date. Therefore, we have jointly written this letter and ask that it be published in the newspaper so that the Zhuoxian County government will promptly send people to investigate and deal with the matter. The facts of their embezzlement and oppression of the masses are written below:

1.  Last year, the three of them illegally embezzled and privately pocketed 3,000 catties of grain confiscated from the landlords in our village, and stole and sold three bags of public grain, using these embezzled properties to open a mooncake shop. In June of the same year, the government lent 60,000 catties of bean cakes to poor peasants, priced at 40 catties of corn per 100 catties. When it was returned in the fall, the government changed it to 19.2 taels of white rice per 100 catties of bean cakes. However, later, under the decision of the three of them, the masses were required to pay according to the rate of 22 catties of white rice per 100 catties of bean cakes. In total, they demanded more than 1,500 catties of white rice from the masses. This year, they embezzled another three bags of public grain (the number of catties is unknown), and there are people who can testify to this.

2.  Last year, the grain coupons for meals eaten by county and district staff in the village were all used privately by them, and the masses who provided meals to the staff did not receive a single coupon. Last summer, when the People's Liberation Army went south, the village used firewood and vegetable money to entertain the passing troops. It is said that the government paid all the money, but the masses did not see a penny.

3.  They used to be plainclothes team members during the enemy and puppet era, and they were very harsh to the people. Now their bad habits have not changed, and they are still the same as before. They carry guns with them and often boast, "It's no problem to take down three or two people." The masses are very scared when they hear this. Last year, they labeled Gao Xuetang and Wei Jingchen as bad eggs, saying that they were holding secret meetings, and beat them up with the heads of shoulder poles. In April of this year, they tied up and severely beat the farmer Lu Qishun, beating him to the point of near death and unconsciousness. Comrade Editor, can we tolerate this kind of criminal behavior that violates human rights?

4.  Last year, Meng Qingyou was allocated six mu of land by the Farmers' Association to grow corn. After the autumn harvest, Zhang Wensheng said that he had gotten the six mu of land for Meng Qingyou, and wanted Meng to give him half of the harvest. As a result, he took away a large portion of the harvest. Last autumn, Meng Qingyou planted wheat on four mu of land, and he said again, "Meng Qingyou has five people in his family and eight mu of land is too much." So he took the land back, and he also harvested the wheat. In addition, Lang Zhaoqi also concealed black land and evaded burdens. All of the above are facts, and there is evidence for investigation.

　　　　Shan Xiu, Deng Cai, Zhang Lu, Meng Qingyou, on behalf of sixty-nine villagers, together.

Editor's Note: The masses of Xiaoshao Village sent representatives to our newspaper to complain about the illegal acts of village cadres embezzling public grain and oppressing the masses. If this reflection is true, the county government should recover all the public grain embezzled and stolen by village cadres Zhang Wensheng, etc., and should give them punishments according to the law. We hope that the Zhuoxian County government will promptly send personnel to investigate and deal with the matter and inform us of the results of the handling.

### 涿县小邵村干部贪污公粮欺压群众  小邵村六十九户农民向本报申诉

　　涿县小邵村干部贪污公粮欺压群众
    小邵村六十九户农民向本报申诉编辑同志：
    我们是河北涿县七区小邵村的农民。在共产党领导下翻了身，都在欢喜地努力生产。可是本村民兵中队长张文生、治安员尉良、前任村长郎兆起等贪污公粮，欺压群众，大大打击了群众的生产情绪。上月我们贫雇中农推派代表呈请涿县政府彻查究办，但至今没有答复。因此，我们联名写了这封信，请在报纸上发表，使涿县县政府从速派人调查处理。现把他们三人的贪污事实和欺压群众的行为写在下面：
    一、他们三人在去年把没收本村地主的三千斤谷子非法私吞，并盗卖公粮三包，并用这些贪污的财产开了一家月饼铺。同年六月间，政府贷给贫农豆饼六万斤，每百斤折价玉米四十斤。到秋后归还时，政府改成每百斤豆饼折白米十九斤二两。可是后来由他们三人作主，要群众按每百斤豆饼折合白米二十二斤交纳。总计向群众多要了一千五百余斤白米。今年他们又贪污公粮三包（斤数不详），有人可以证明。
    二、去年全年县、区工作人员在村中派饭吃的粮票，全被他们私用了，给工作人员派饭的群众却没有收到一张。去年夏天，解放军南下时，村里招待过路军队用的柴草菜金，听说政府全部付了款，但群众没有见到分文。
    三、他们曾在敌伪时代当过便衣队，对待民众十分苛毒，现在恶习未改，还和过去一样。他们随身带着枪，常常夸口说：“ 嘣个三个两个没有问题。”群众听了很害怕。去年他们给高学堂、尉敬臣扣了个帽子，说他俩开小会，是坏蛋，用扁担头打了他们一顿。今年四月间，又把农民卢起顺扣起吊打，把他打得死去活来，昏迷不醒。编者同志，这种侵犯人权的罪恶行为我们能容忍吗？
    四、去年孟庆友经农会给调剂到土地六亩，种了棒子。秋收后，张文生说这六亩地是他给孟庆友搞到的，要孟把收获物的一半分给他，结果分给了他收成的一大半。去秋孟庆友种了麦子四亩，他又说：“孟庆友五口人种八亩地，太多。”于是就将地要去，麦子也被他收割了。此外，郎兆起还隐瞒黑地，逃避负担。以上这些全是事实，都有证据，可供调查。
          单秀、邓才、张禄、孟庆友代表六十九户民众同上
    编者按：小邵村群众推派代表携带此信亲来本报诉述村干部贪污公粮、欺压群众的不法行为。如果这一反映属实，县政府应将村干部张文生等贪污盗卖的公粮全部追回，并应依法给予处分。希望涿县政府迅速派员调查处理，并将处理结果告诉我们。
