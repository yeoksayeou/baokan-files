Two Major Principles for Adjusting Taxation

Adjusting taxation is a major issue in our country's work and people's lives at present.

According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government convened a tax conference to specifically discuss this issue. The Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference discussed and approved the reports on adjusting taxation by Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and Bo Yibo, Deputy Director. In addition to the Government Administration Council's decision on May 31st to announce the summer grain tax for the newly liberated areas in 1950, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council's decision on May 31st to announce the reduction of salt tax, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council also partially announced the specific measures for adjusting taxation work on June 29th, and the remaining parts will be announced successively soon. The implementation of the work of adjusting taxation in various places has been universally welcomed by people of all strata.

As a result of the above measures, our taxation work has undergone the following changes: (1) The burden on the people has been appropriately reduced. In terms of agricultural tax, the average tax rate for summer grain tax in the new areas has been reduced by 4 percent compared with the autumn tax last year, from 17 percent to 13 percent. If local surcharges are included, it is reduced from 20 percent to 14.95 percent. In terms of industrial and commercial tax, the salt tax has been reduced by 50 percent. Other taxes have also been reduced compared to the 1950 budget. (2) The number of commodity tax items has been reduced and merged, from the original 1,136 items to 358 items. (3) Industrial and commercial tax rates have also been appropriately changed. (4) Tax collection methods have also been clearly stipulated to combine self-reporting and inspection, tax calculation according to rates, democratic appraisal, and fixed quotas and fixed amounts.

What principles are these adjustments based on, and what principles must be implemented? Article 40 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that regarding finance, "the balance of financial revenue and expenditure" should be achieved, and in terms of taxation, "simplifying the tax system and implementing reasonable burdens" should be the principle, "to ensure the supply of the revolutionary war, taking into account the recovery and development of production and the needs of the country." In the current situation, it can also be said to be two main principles: first, consolidating the balance of financial revenue and expenditure; second, taking into account the recovery and development of production.

In the process of adjusting taxation, most taxpayers are satisfied. However, some taxpayers believe that the tax reduction is not enough and hope to reduce or exempt certain tax items. Some tax workers also believe that the reduction is too much, and they are worried that financial revenue will not be guaranteed. There are also some speculators who are fantasizing and waiting; they believe that such tax cuts are very dangerous for the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, so currency may inflate again, and they may have another chance to rise.

Then, after adjusting the taxation according to the established method, can it consolidate the financial balance?

It should be said that it can be consolidated. There are difficulties, but they can be overcome.

Why can the balance of financial revenue and expenditure be consolidated even though there are difficulties? As mentioned above, the result of the reduction of agricultural and industrial and commercial taxes is obviously a reduction in income compared to the revenue part of the 1950 national revenue and expenditure budget. This is certainly a difficulty. This difficulty is consciously endured by our People's Government, because it is necessary to appropriately reduce the burden on the people in order to recuperate. But can the new financial gap caused by this be compensated? It can be compensated, mainly by saving expenditures. The key here is that the agricultural tax and industrial and commercial tax after reduction and exemption must be collected in full, without shortage. For example, the average of 13 percent agricultural tax cannot be reduced any further; the halved salt tax cannot have any more tax evasion; in terms of industrial and commercial tax, the adjusted commodity tax, business tax, income tax, etc., must all be collected in full. Local People's Governments, local financial and tax authorities, and all taxpayers must work together to ensure the completion of tax tasks according to tax rates. Otherwise, the consolidation of the balance of revenue and expenditure and the stability of prices will be in danger. Therefore, any idea that is not determined to complete the tax task according to the tax rate must be opposed.

The people of the whole country must earnestly protect our achievements in balancing financial revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices, and must be very vigilant against the sabotage of these achievements by saboteurs and speculators. After the publication of Truman's robber statement on June 27, the prices of certain imported commodities (such as rubber, sugar, Western medicine, gasoline, and the black market price of gold and silver dollars) in major cities across the country once fluctuated. But the facts of the past two weeks have shown that the rise in the prices of these items cannot affect the rise in major prices, and this rise can also be quelled by the People's Government in the near future. However, this fact is still a warning to us that saboteurs and speculators with undying ambitions want to attack our already stable financial and economic situation. From this, it can be seen that we must carefully and tenaciously protect the financial balance of our country as we protect our own lives. And in order to protect the financial balance, we must continue to make strenuous efforts to do a good job in taxation, and not allow the slightest slack or negligence.

The second principle of adjusting taxation is to take care of production. From a longer-term and more fundamental perspective, this principle is the basic policy of our taxation work. At a time when the needs of the revolutionary war supply are still great and the expenses of the military and administrative personnel of the People's Government cannot be reduced substantially, we can only adopt a policy that takes into account both finance and production, and for the time being, we must still pay more attention to the needs of finance.

How does taxation take care of production?

First of all, in terms of agricultural tax, the People's Government has adopted the following measures: 1. Only tax agricultural products. All miscellaneous taxes that hinder the development of agriculture, rural sideline industries, and livestock are not levied, in order to encourage the recovery and development of rural sideline industries. 2. Appropriately reduce agricultural tax. As mentioned earlier, from an average of 17 percent to 13 percent. This is to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production. 3. The collection of agricultural tax is based on the normal annual yield of various types of land. No tax is levied on agricultural products with higher income due to hard work, and tax is levied on those with insufficient normal annual yield according to the usual yield. This restricts those who do not work hard and rewards those who work hard. 4. The transaction tax in rural areas is limited to those who go through brokers and traders, and no tax is levied on those who trade directly with state-owned stores, cooperatives, fixed industrial and commercial enterprises, and the people. The temporary commercial tax does not levy tax on farmers selling household handicrafts and rural sideline products, and fishermen selling fish products, in order to facilitate the exchange relations between individual economies and promote urban-rural exchanges.

In terms of industrial and commercial tax, the People's Government has always adopted a taxation policy that is lighter on industry than on commerce and lighter on daily necessities than on luxury goods. In this adjustment of taxation, this basic policy is still being implemented. The basic spirit of this policy is first reflected in the tax exemption and reduction of products manufactured by industries that produce means of livelihood and means of production. In the commodity tax, the number of tax items has been reduced from 1,136 to 358. Tax-exempt items include earth nitrates, pottery, lime, earthen bricks and tiles, and leather. Tax-reduced items include hardware, electrical materials, mineral products, leather, rubber products, glass products, and vegetable oils. These are all related to the recovery and development of industry. Secondly, in order to promote the recovery and development of the cotton and wool textile industry, cotton yarn and cotton fabrics, wool yarn and wool fabrics are merged into one tax, and the tax rate is reduced. The merged tax rate should have been 16.4 percent for the former, but it is now reduced to 15 percent. The latter should have been 30 percent, but it is now reduced to 20 percent. Third, in order to encourage export and domestic sales, the method of tax rebate has been decided for materials that are unfavorable to foreign sales, so that foreign sales can be encouraged. In terms of domestic sales, the original tax rate for chemical alkali was 10 percent, but it is now reduced to 5 percent. The original tax rate for lead, sulfur, and fluorite was 10 percent, but it is now reduced to 5 percent. The original tax rate for matches was 20 percent, but it is now changed to 15 percent. Fourth, income tax has also been reduced. In the past, 5 percent was levied on 1 million yuan, but now this tax rate applies to 3 million yuan. In the past, the highest progressive point was 30 percent for 30 million yuan, but now it is raised to 100 million yuan. Fifth, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of private industrial and commercial enterprises, an encouraging policy is adopted for the development of private industrial and commercial branches and joint operations. Sixth, in order to encourage urban homeowners to maintain and operate, both property tax and land tax are changed from a progressive system to a proportional system, and the tax rate is also reduced uniformly.

The basic view of simplifying tax procedures is still to take care of production. In terms of cargo permits and stamps, many cumbersome procedures have now been reduced to facilitate the operation of industrial and commercial enterprises.

The above is the general content of taking care of production in the tax system.

The new method of collecting industrial and commercial tax also implements the two principles of taking care of both finance and production. This is a progress in the method of collecting industrial and commercial tax. For industrial and commercial enterprises with a sound accounting system that can be used as a basis for collection, the method of self-reporting and inspection and tax calculation according to rates is adopted. For those who do not meet the above conditions, the method of self-reporting and public discussion and democratic appraisal is adopted, but tax is still calculated according to rates. For small industrial and commercial enterprises and industrial and commercial enterprises in small towns, when both inspection and democratic appraisal are difficult, the method of fixed tax amounts on a regular basis based on democratic appraisal is adopted.

Why are these three methods taking care of both finance and production?

Obviously, these three methods are relatively thorough in terms of ensuring tax revenue. The possibility of tax evasion is small. These three methods have been clearly stipulated in the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax passed by the Government Administration Council on January 27 this year. However, the conditions at that time were not yet mature, that is, the work experience of the financial and tax workers of the People's Government and the understanding of the industrial and commercial circles of the tax work of the People's Government could not guarantee the implementation of the above three methods. Therefore, serious tax evasion occurred in some major cities at the beginning of this year. In order to ensure the completion of the tax task and strive for the balance of national financial revenue and expenditure, the National Finance Conference in February this year decided to mainly adopt the method of democratic appraisal to solve the serious tax evasion in some major cities. At that time, the conference pointed out that democratic appraisal was not the best method, and the best method was the method of self-reporting and inspection and tax calculation according to rates that had been implemented in Dalian. However, at that time, democratic appraisal was the most important method. Due to the implementation of this method, obvious results have been received in the past three or four months. Of course, the method of democratic appraisal has shortcomings, that is, the phenomenon of the small squeezing the big, the big squeezing the small, and the abnormally light and abnormally heavy has occurred. Now, the conditions for implementing the regulations stipulated by the Government Administration Council on January 27 are more mature than in the past. Therefore, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has decided to use the three methods decided half a year ago at the same time. The purpose of doing this is still: to take care of both finance and production.

The method of fixed tax amounts on a regular basis based on democratic appraisal for small industrial and commercial enterprises and small towns has basically not been implemented in the past, but this method is very convenient for the government and such taxpayers. It will not make it impossible for the government to inspect accounts, and it will not delay the business of small industrial and commercial enterprises by "appraising" frequently.

In order to carry out tax work more thoroughly, tax reconsideration committees have been established or are being established in major cities, composed of representatives from the tax bureau, the industrial and commercial bureau, and the federation of industry and commerce. This makes the tax collection method more complete.

The work of adjusting taxation is underway in various places, and there are constant new developments. The national tax staff has made brilliant achievements in the past eight months and made great contributions to achieving a balance in the nation's fiscal revenues and expenditures. In the future, as long as we firmly grasp the principle of taking into account both finance and production, our taxation work will definitely achieve greater results.

　　调整税收的两大原则
    调整税收是目前我们国家工作和人民生活中的一个重大问题。
    根据毛主席的指示，政务院财经委员会与中央人民政府财政部曾经召集税务会议，专门讨论了这一个问题。人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议曾经讨论与同意了政务院财委会陈云主任和薄一波副主任关于调整税收问题的报告。除政务院已于五月三十一日公布一九五○年新解放区夏征公粮的决定，政务院财经委员会于五月三十一日公布减低盐税的决定外，六月二十九日政务院财经委员会又已部分地公布了调整税收工作的具体办法，其余部分不久亦将陆续公布。各地执行调整税收的工作，得到了各阶层人民的普遍欢迎。
    由于上述各项措施的结果，我们的税收工作，有了下述的变化：（一）人民的负担是酌量减轻了。在农业税方面，新区夏征公粮比去年秋征的平均税率，减了百分之四，即由百分之十七减为百分之十三。如以地方附加合计，则由百分之二十，减为百分之十四点九五。在工商业税方面，盐税减了百分之五十。其他各项税收，比一九五○年概算均有减少。（二）货物税税目经过减少合并，已由原来的一一三六项，减为三五八项。（三）工商业税率也有些适当的变更。（四）收税方法，也明确规定以自报查账、依率计征，民主评议、与定期定额三者相结合。
    上述的调整工作，根据什么原则以及必须贯彻什么原则呢？人民政协共同纲领第四十条规定：关于财政，应当“平衡财政收支”，而在税收方面，应当“以保障革命战争的供给、照顾生产的恢复和发展及国家的需要为原则，简化税制，实行合理负担”。按照目前的情况来说，也可说是两项主要原则：一、巩固财政收支平衡；二、照顾生产的恢复和发展。
    在调整税收过程中，大多数纳税人是满意的。但有些纳税人认为税还减得不够，还希望减征或免征某些税目。也有些税务工作人员，认为减得太多，恐怕财政收入没有保证。还有些投机家是在幻想着、等待着；他们认为这样的减税，对于财政收支平衡很有危险，因此通货还可能从新膨胀，他们还可能有再起的机会。
    那么，照已定办法调整税收之后，究竟能不能巩固财政平衡呢？
    应当说，能巩固。困难是有的，但是是可以克服的。
    为什么说虽有困难还能巩固财政收支平衡呢？如上所说，农业税、工商税减征的结果，比一九五○年全国收支概算的收入部分，显然是减收了。这当然是个困难。这个困难是我们的人民政府自觉地忍受的。因为为了适当地减轻人民负担，以休养民力，这样作是必要的。但是因此而造成的财政上新的差额，能不能抵补呢？能够抵补的，主要地，是靠支出的节约来抵补。这里的关键是在于已经减免之后的农业税与工商业税，必须如数征齐，不能短少。例如，平均百分之十三的农业税，不能再少征；已减半的盐税不能再有偷漏；在工商税方面，已调整以后的货物税、营业税、所得税等，都须十足收齐。各地人民政府、各地财政税收机关，以及全体纳税人，必须共同努力，保证按税率完成税收任务。否则对于收支平衡的巩固与物价的稳定，就都要发生危险。因此，任何不坚决按照税率完成税收任务的思想，都必须加以反对。
    全国人民必须认真保护我们财政收支平衡和物价稳定的成绩，必须十分警惕破坏分子和投机分子对于我们这个成绩的破坏。六月二十七日杜鲁门强盗声明发表之后，全国各大城市某些入口商品的物价（如橡胶、白糖、西药、汽油、及黄金白洋的黑市）曾经发生波动。但两周来的事实已经表明，这些物品价格的上涨不可能影响主要物价的上涨，而且这种上涨在不久的将来也是可以被人民政府平息下去的。但是这次的事实，毕竟是警戒了我们，破坏分子和野心不死的投机分子想要打击我们的已经开始稳定的财政经济局面。由此可见，我们必须小心翼翼地顽强地如同保护我们自己生命一样来保护我们国家的财政平衡。而为了保护财政平衡，就必须继续作紧张的努力来办好税收，不允许有丝毫的懈怠疏忽。
    调整税收第二个原则是照顾生产。从更长远更根本的意义讲，这一个原则是我们税收工作的基本方针。在现在革命战争供给的需要还很大，人民政府军政人员的费用还不能大量减少的时候，我们只能采取财政与生产兼顾的方针，而且暂时还必须多照顾一些财政的需要。
    税收怎样来照顾生产呢？
    首先在农业税方面。人民政府采取了下列的办法：一、只向农业正产物征税。凡有碍发展农业、农村副业和牲畜的杂税，概不征收，以鼓励农村副业的恢复和发展。二、适当地减轻农业税。如前所述，由平均百分之十七减为百分之十三。这是为了鼓励农民的生产积极性。三、农业税的征收，以各种不同土地的常年应产量为标准，对于努力耕作而多收入的农产物不收税，而对于不足常年应产量者照通常产量征税。这就限制了不努力耕作的人，奖励了努力耕作的人。四、农村中的交易税，只限于经过牙纪与交易员者，其余由国营商店，合作社，固定的工商业和人民直接交易者不再征税。临时商业税中，对于农民推销家庭手工业品和农村副业品，渔民推销渔产，亦不征税。以便利个体经济间的交换关系，促进城乡交流。
    在工商税方面。人民政府历来就是采取工轻于商与日用品轻于奢侈品的征税政策的。在这一次调整税收中，仍然贯彻着这一个基本政策。这一政策的基本精神，首先表现在制造生活资料与生产资料的工业的产品之免税与减税。在货物税中，从一一三六项税目，减少到三五八项。免税税目中，土硝、陶器、石灰、土制砖瓦、皮革等。减税的税目中，有五金类、电料类、矿产品、皮革、橡胶制品、玻璃制品、植物油等。这些都是与恢复发展工业有关的。其次，为了促进棉、毛纺织业的恢复和发展，棉纱和棉织品，毛纱和毛织品均合并征税，并减低了税率。合并后的税率，前者本应为百分之十六·四，现减为百分之十五。后者本应为百分之三十，现减为百分之二十。第三，为了鼓励出口和内销，对于外销不利的物资，已决定了退税的办法，这样就可以鼓励外销。在内销方面，化学碱原为百分之十，现减为百分之五。铅、硫磺、氟石原为百分之十，现减为百分之五。火柴原为百分之二十，现改为百分之十五。第四，所得税亦有减轻。过去一百万元征百分之五，现在三百万元才适用这个税率。过去最高累进点是三千万元征百分之三十，现在提高到一亿元。第五，为了鼓励私人工商业的积极性，对于私营工商业的发展总分支机构及联合经营，采取鼓励政策。第六，为了鼓励城市房屋所有者的维持与经营，对于房产税和地产税，均由累进制改为比例制，税率亦一律减轻。
    简化税收手续的基本观点，仍然是照顾生产。在货照、印花等方面，现在已减去了许多麻烦手续，以便利工商业者的经营。
    以上是税收制度上照顾生产的大体内容。
    新的工商税征收方法，也是贯彻着既照顾财政又照顾生产这两个原则的。这是工商税征收方法上的一个进步。对于有健全的会计制度，可以作为征收确据的工商企业，采自报查账，按率计征的方法。对于不合前项条件者，采自报公议，民主评定的方法，但仍然按率计征。对小工商业与小城镇的工商业，采取查账与民主评议都有困难时，则采用在民主评议基础上的定期定额的征税办法。
    这样三种办法，为什么是既照顾了财政，又照顾了生产呢？
    很显然，这三个办法，从保证税收来说是比较周密的。偷漏的可能性较小。这三个办法，在本年一月二十七日政务院所通过的工商业税暂行条例中已有明白的规定。但是，那时的条件还不成熟，即是人民政府财政税务工作人员的工作经验以及工商业界对于人民政府税务工作方面的了解，均还不能保证上述三个方法的实行。因此，今年年初某些大城市曾经发生严重的偷税与漏税的现象。为了保证税收任务的完成，争取国家财政收支的平衡，今年二月全国财政会议曾决定主要采用民主评议的方法，以解决某些大城市严重的偷漏税现象。当时会议一方面指出民主评议还不是最好的方法，最好的方法是大连已经实行的自报查账，依率计征的方法。但是，在那时，民主评议却是最主要的方法。由于实行了这一个方法，三四个月来已收到了明显的效果。当然，民主评议的方法是有缺点的，就是发生了以小挤大、以大挤小、畸轻畸重的现象。现在，实行一月二十七日政务院规定的条件比过去成熟了。因此，政务院财经委员会又决定将半年前已决定的三种方法同时并用。这样作的目的，仍然是：既照顾财政，又照顾生产。
    对于小工商业者及小城镇实行民主评议基础上的定期定额的征税办法，过去基本上没有实行过，但是，这个办法对于政府与这样的纳税人是很便利的。既不至于使政府无法查账，也不至于经常“评议”，耽误小工商业者的营业。
    为了更周密地进行税收工作起见，各大城市都设立了或正在设立税务复议委员会，由税务局、工商局及工商联合会三方面派员组成。这就使税收方法更加完备了。
    调整税收工作，各地正在进行，而且不断有新的进展。全国税收工作人员过去八个月来有光辉的成就，对争取国家财政收支平衡有很大的贡献。今后，只要紧紧掌握着财政与生产兼顾的原则，我们的税收工作一定会有更大的成绩。
