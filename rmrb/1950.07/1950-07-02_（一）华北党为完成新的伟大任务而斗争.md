　　(I) The North China Party Struggles to Complete New Great Tasks
　　Over the past twenty-nine years, the North China Party has gone through the Great Revolution, the Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Mao Zedong, and with the support of the revolutionary people and the People's Liberation Army of the whole country, it eliminated the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang and liberated the whole of North China. The North China Party has become a powerful part of the great Bolshevik Chinese Communist Party that connects millions of people and has rich experience and fighting power. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin last year, the leading organs of the North China Party moved from the countryside to the cities and began new work. At present, the task of the North China Party is to further unite all the people of North China and struggle for the correct implementation and realization of Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. According to the situation in North China, the following main tasks should be done urgently:

　　(1) Vigorously launch the production movement. Agricultural production should ensure that the old areas will be restored to pre-war levels by the end of this year, and the new areas will be restored within the next one or two years. On the basis of existing production, we should vigorously increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials, and export commodities. In order to complete the above tasks, we must implement the production policy and eliminate the remnants of utopian agricultural socialist ideas. We should call on the peasant masses to implement the direction of combining organization and technology closely, improve agricultural technology, overcome disasters, and develop and improve the work of supply and marketing cooperatives. Industrial production is required to be fully restored within three to five years. To this end, we must first overcome the current difficulties of industry and commerce. All localities should carefully study the instructions of the Central Committee and the North China Bureau on adjusting industry and commerce and improving public-private relations, and put them into practice. Affirm achievements, overcome mistakes, and formulate practical and effective specific measures for adjusting public-private relations and labor-capital relations, so that the five types of economy can cooperate and divide labor under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each playing its part. In both public and private factories, we should launch production competition movements, overcome waste, practice strict economy, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and accelerate circulation in order to restore and develop the entire social economy of North China and continue to support the task of liberating Taiwan and Tibet. Cultural and educational work, public security work, and other work should all revolve around and serve this central task.

　　(2) Continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and strengthen unity with all democratic parties, democratic classes, and all patriotic democratic people. Only in this way can we better and faster eliminate the remaining enemies and build our new country. Summarize and improve the experience of holding people's representative conferences in various places, so that people's representative conferences at all levels can be held better. The government should report its work to the people's representative conference each time, and submit it to the representative conference for review. All major resolutions must be implemented through the people's representative conference. Representatives attending the meeting should have full speaking rights. Within the government, all democratic people from all parties should be treated equally, so that they have positions and powers, have prospects for development, can work with peace of mind, and each can play their part.

　　(3) We must correctly implement the Central Committee's instructions on consolidating the Party and developing the Party's organization. In view of the fact that the North China Party already has so many members, we should focus on consolidating the Party's organization and improving the political quality of Party members in the future. Therefore, in the rural areas of the old liberated areas, we should completely stop development and conduct education and review work for Party members universally. Those who do not meet the conditions of Party members should be ordered to withdraw from the Party or be expelled from the Party in an appropriate manner, and necessary cleaning work should be carried out on a few lawbreakers or degenerate elements. Only in individual "white spot villages" or new areas after land reform, can conscious activists with good backgrounds be absorbed into the Party after education, openly, individually, and cautiously, in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the Party Constitution. Today, the main direction of development of the North China Party should be among the workers in urban factories and mines, increasing the proportion of workers within the Party. This should also be done by emphasizing quality over quantity, absorbing seriously and individually, and resolutely preventing speculators from joining the Party. In addition, we should correctly implement the Central Committee's instructions on carrying out the Party-wide rectification movement, using the method of reading documents, checking work, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, with a realistic and truth-seeking attitude and the aim of curing the disease to save the patient, distinguishing between right and wrong and the importance of issues, commending good Party members, and criticizing and punishing bad Party members, in order to overcome the bureaucratic and commandist work styles that currently exist seriously within the Party. In leadership work, we should focus more on opposing bureaucracy, and in the implementation of work, we should focus more on opposing commandism. At the level of prefectural committees and county committees and above, we should focus more on opposing bureaucracy, while at the level of districts and villages, we should focus more on opposing commandism. In terms of steps, we should first rectify the higher levels and then rectify the lower levels. First, rectify the cadres at the level of prefectural committees and county committees and above, cultivate backbones, create experience, and then rectify the cadres at the level of districts and villages. In terms of progress, we should strive for stability. Our requirement is to solve problems and pay attention to methods. We must ensure that the result of the rectification is that the righteous spirit is promoted, the evil spirit is overcome, the ideological and policy level of the cadres is improved, the mistakes made in the work are eliminated, the whole Party is more united, and the connection between the Party and the people is closer.

　　All Communist Party members in North China should firmly remember Chairman Mao's words: "Be prudent and humble, guard against arrogance and rashness," and "The floor should be swept every day, and the face should be washed every day," and work hard to transform and improve themselves, and to consolidate the great Party and the non-Party alliance.

　　（一）华北党为完成新的伟大任务而斗争
    华北党二十九年来，经过了大革命、内战、抗日战争和解放战争，在以毛泽东为首的党中央正确领导下，在全国革命人民和人民解放军支援下，肃清了国民党的反动力量，解放了全华北。华北党已经成了联系千百万群众的、有丰富经验的、有战斗力的布尔塞维克化的伟大中国共产党的强有力的一部分。去年解放京津之后，华北党的领导机关，由乡村转入城市，开始了新的工作。目前华北党的任务是要进一步团结全华北人民，为正确执行与贯彻党中央三中全会上毛主席的报告而斗争。根据华北情况，目前亟应做好下列各项主要工作：
    （一）全力开展生产运动。农业生产应保证老区在今年年底，新区在今明两年内恢复到战前水平。要在现有生产基础上，大力增产粮食、工业原料及出口商品。为了完成上述任务，就要贯彻生产政策，消除空想的农业社会主义思想的残余。应号召农民群众贯彻组织起来与技术密切结合的方向，提高农业技术，战胜灾害，发展和改善供销合作社工作。工业生产要求于三、五年内全部恢复起来。为此，首先要克服目前工商业的困难，各地应认真研究中央和华北局关于调整工商业、改善公私关系的指示，并付诸实施。肯定成绩，克服错误，订出调整公私关系及劳资关系的切实有效的具体办法，使五种经济在国营经济领导下分工合作，各得其所。在公私工厂中，均应开展生产竞赛运动，克服浪费，厉行节约，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，加速流转，以恢复和发展华北整个社会经济，继续支持完成解放台湾与西藏的任务。文化教育工作、治安工作及其他工作，都应当围绕并服务于这一中心工作。
    （二）继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，加强团结各民主党派、各民主阶级和一切爱国民主人士。只有如此才能更好更快地消灭残敌，建设我们的新国家。总结和提高各地召开人民代表会议的经验，使各级人民代表会议开的更好。政府每次要向人民代表会议报告工作，交由代表会议审查。一切重大的决议，都要通过人民代表会议去执行。要使参加会议的代表，有充分的发言权。在政府内部，对各党派民主人士，应一视同仁，使之有职有权，有发展前途，各得其所，安心工作。
    （三）必须正确执行中央关于巩固党与发展党的组织的指示。鉴于目前华北党已有这样多的党员，今后应着重巩固党的组织和提高党员的政治质量。因此，在老解放区的农村中，应完全停止发展，普遍地进行对党员的教育和审查工作。凡不够党员条件的应即用适当方法令其退党或开除党籍，对少数违法犯纪或一些蜕化分子应进行必要的洗刷工作。只对于个别的“白点村”或土改后的新区，才对成份好的有觉悟的积极分子，经过教育，公开地、个别而慎重地、按着党章规定的条件吸收入党。今天华北党的主要发展方向应是在城市工厂和矿山的工人中，提高党内工人成份的比重。这同样应采取重质不重量，严肃地、个别地吸收，坚决阻止投机分子入党。此外，应当正确地执行中央关于开展全党整风运动的指示，用阅读文件、检查工作、开展批评自我批评的方式，以实事求是、治病救人的态度，分清问题的是非轻重，表扬好的党员，批评与处分不好的党员，以达到克服党内目前严重存在着的官僚主义与命令主义作风。在领导工作上，应多着重反对官僚主义，在执行工作上，则应多着重反对命令主义。地委、县委以上应多着重反对官僚主义，区村则应多着重反对命令主义。在步骤上，应先整上级，后整下级。首先将地委、县委以上干部整好，培养骨干，创造经验，然后再整区村干部。在进度上，应力求稳当。我们的要求是既要解决问题，又要讲究方法。务使整风结果，达到正气发扬起来，邪气克服下去，提高干部的思想政策水平，肃清工作中所犯错误，使全党更加团结，党和人民的联系更加密切。
    华北所有的共产党员，应该牢牢地记住毛主席的话：“谨慎谦虚、戒骄戒躁”，“地要天天扫，脸要天天洗”，这样来努力改造和提高自己，来巩固伟大的党和非党的联盟。
