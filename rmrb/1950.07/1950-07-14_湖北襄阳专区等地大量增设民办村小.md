　　【Our News】In order to rapidly restore primary school education and reduce the number of out-of-school children, Hubei Province has, in addition to the largely restored provincial and county-run primary schools, been promoting private primary schools to supplement the current inadequacy of government financial resources. Xiangyang Prefecture in the province has correctly grasped this policy, formulated specific measures to encourage and support private primary schools, and created a mass upsurge in running schools. According to statistics, the prefecture already has 2,102 private village elementary schools with over 94,000 students. Due to the development of private elementary schools, the total number of public and private schools in the prefecture has increased by 190% compared to last year, the number of students has increased by 217%, and the number of teachers and staff has increased by 175%. In Huanggang, Daye, and other prefectures, as well as Shashi, Yichang, and other cities, private village elementary schools and private primary schools have also increased, and the number of enrolled children has increased by more than 45% compared to last year.

　　湖北襄阳专区等地大量增设民办村小
    【本报讯】湖北省为迅速恢复小学教育，减少失学儿童，本年来除省、县立小学已大部恢复外，并提倡民办小学，以补目前政府财力的不足。该省襄阳专区由于正确地掌握了这一方针，订出了鼓励扶助民办小学的具体办法，造成了群众性的办学热潮，据统计，该专区已有民办村小二千一百零二所，学生九万四千余人。因为民办小学的发展，该专区公私立学校总数比去年增加了百分之一百九十，学生增加了百分之二百十七；教职员增加了百分之一百七十五。黄岗、大冶等专区和沙市、宜昌等市，民办村小和私立小学亦有增加，入学儿童都比去年增加了百分之四十五以上。（方羊）
