　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th -- The first session of the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the North Sichuan Administrative Region was held from June 23rd to July 1st. Four hundred and thirty-three representatives from all walks of life attended. The conference, based on the specific circumstances of the North Sichuan region, formulated the region's future policies. Hu Yaobang, Director of the North Sichuan Administrative Office, gave a report at the meeting on the work of the region since liberation. He pointed out that in the half-year since liberation, North Sichuan had basically eliminated the major bandit forces within its borders, appropriately dealt with the Kuomintang's routed officers and soldiers and reorganized the insurgent troops, and established a revolutionary order of the people's democratic dictatorship; in economic work, the People's Government provided loans to support state-owned enterprises and private factories and merchants beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, while also rectifying financial revenues and expenditures and stabilizing prices.
    In his report, Hu Yaobang pointed out that the current policies of the North Sichuan Administrative Office are to thoroughly eliminate bandits and secret agents, further consolidate the revolutionary order; establish and strengthen people's democratic power at all levels; implement the movement against local bullies and for rent reduction, and prepare for land reform after the autumn of next year; restore and develop agricultural production; adjust industry and commerce; reform cultural and educational undertakings in a planned and step-by-step manner; and consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front.
    The conference conducted careful discussions based on Director Hu's report, and made supplements and revisions to certain parts of the current policies. Regarding the thorough elimination of bandits and secret agents, the conference believed that it should be carried out under the policy of combining leniency and suppression. The conference also suggested establishing people's anti-bandit self-defense armed forces that do not separate from production. In implementing the movement against local bullies and for rent reduction and preparing for land reform, the conference decided that in addition to complying with the "Southwest Region Interim Regulations on Rent Reduction" and issuing implementation details, full preparations should be made, farmers' associations and farmers' representative conferences should be established and improved, and rural investigations and research should be conducted. In developing rural production, it was decided to support industrial raw materials such as cotton, hemp, and silk, as well as other local products. Regarding the adjustment of industry and commerce, the conference decided to provide all possible assistance to the more than two million handicraft workers engaged in weaving, silk reeling, salt making, etc., implement joint operations, and improve quality. At the same time, state-owned trading organizations should, in accordance with national price policies, systematically purchase agricultural products, supply industrial products, control major materials, continue to stabilize prices, and combat speculation. Finally, the conference elected 47 people, including Hu Yaobang, to form a consultative committee.

　　川北举行人民代表会议制订了彻底肃清土匪等施政方针
    【新华社重庆十八日电】川北行政区首届各界人民代表会议，于六月二十三日至七月一日举行。出席各界代表四百三十三名。会议根据川北地区的具体情况，制订了川北区今后的施政方针。川北行署主任胡耀邦在会上作了关于该区解放以来的工作报告。他指出：川北区在解放半年来，基本上肃清了境内的大股土匪，适当地处理了国民党溃散官兵和整编了起义部队，建立了人民民主专政的革命秩序；在经济工作上，人民政府贷款扶持了公营企业和有益于国计民生私营厂商，同时整顿了财政收支，稳定了物价。
    胡耀邦在报告中指出：目前川北行署的施政方针是彻底肃清土匪特务，进一步地巩固革命秩序；建立和加强各级人民民主政权；实行反恶霸、减租运动，准备在明年秋后进行土地改革；恢复与发展农业生产；调整工商业；有计划有步骤地改革文化教育事业；巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线。
    会议根据胡主任报告进行了缜密讨论，并对目前施政方针中某些部分作了补充和修正。关于彻底肃清土匪特务方面，会议认为应在宽大与镇压相结合的方针之下进行。会议并建议建立不脱离生产的人民防匪自卫武装。在实行反恶霸减租运动、准备土地改革方面，会议决定除遵照“西南区减租暂行条例”并颁发实施细则外，应进行充分准备工作，建立与健全农民协会和农民代表大会和进行农村调查研究等。在发展农村生产方面，决定扶植棉、麻、丝等工业原料及其他土产。关于调整工商业方面，会议决定以一切可能扶助从事织布、缫丝、制盐等的约在二百万以上的手工业工人，实行联营，提高质量。同时国营贸易机构应根据国家价格政策，有计划地收购农产品，供给工业品，掌握主要物资，继续稳定物价，打击投机。会议最后选出胡耀邦等四十七人组成协商委员会。
