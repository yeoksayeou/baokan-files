Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 19th: The first Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference was held in Nanchang City from July 5th to 16th. Seven hundred and fifty-two representatives attended. The conference adopted the Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Association Organizational Charter, formulated the Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Association Struggle Program, and elected Liu Junxiu, Fang Zichun, and seventy-five others as members of the Provincial Farmers' Association, formally establishing the Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Association. The conference conducted a word-by-word discussion of the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China." During the discussion, the representatives denounced the landlord class's cruel feudal exploitation, expressed unanimous support for the Land Reform Law, and regarded it as a fundamental law for farmers to achieve liberation, requiring careful study and conscientious implementation. Based on the fundamental spirit of the Land Reform Law and the specific conditions of Jiangxi Province, the conference put forward preliminary opinions on the implementing details of the land reform in Jiangxi Province. These opinions have been submitted to the Provincial People's Government for review and will be promulgated for implementation. After research, the conference believes that land reform can be carried out in areas with seven to eight million people in the rural areas of Jiangxi Province this winter. The representatives also discussed the specific preparatory work for land reform, deciding that in areas where land reform will be implemented this winter, it is now necessary to further mobilize the masses, implement the movement against local bullies and for rent reduction, and rectify and expand the organization of farmers' associations, overcoming the past tendencies of closed-doorism and formalism in the organizational work of farmers' associations, and organizing the laboring farmers, who account for 90% of the rural population, into the farmers' associations. Areas that do not implement land reform this winter should launch and organize the peasant masses in a comprehensive anti-hegemony movement and production movement, creating favorable conditions for the implementation of land reform next year. The conference also decided to write a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to conscientiously follow the correct policy of land reform in the People's Republic of China, and cooperate with the vast number of peasants in the province to carry out land reform in a step-by-step and orderly manner, and develop production.
    Jiangxi Farmers' Association Develops Vigorously with 1.3 Million Members
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 19th: After nearly a year of rural social reform movement, the Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Association has achieved great development. According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-June, 12,855 administrative villages in the province have established farmers' associations, accounting for 81.2% of the total number of administrative villages in the province, with approximately 1.3 million members. Now the Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Association has been established in Nanchang; the Fuliang Special District Farmers' Association was also established in early June.
    In the past year, farmers' associations in various parts of Jiangxi have played a significant role in various tasks such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent and refunding rent, rational burdens, and spring ploughing production. However, due to the rapid development of work, educational work and organizational work have not been carried out in a timely manner, and there are still some problems in the organization of farmers' associations in various places. At present, farmers' associations in various places can be roughly divided into three types: (1) In areas where the peasant masses have been initially mobilized, the composition of farmers' association cadres is generally better; however, due to insufficient education, the internal democratic system is lacking, and some cadres have bad work styles such as coercion and commandism, and even violate policies such as arbitrarily detaining and fining people; as a result, cadres are divorced from the masses, or the relationship between cadres and the masses is not coordinated. (2) In areas where the peasant masses have been slightly mobilized, there is a general tendency of formalism or closed-doorism in farmers' associations. Some use peasant mass meetings instead of farmers' associations; some stipulate excessively harsh conditions for membership, only absorbing poor peasants and farm laborers into the association, or stipulating that there must be a probationary period for membership, or only allowing one person from each household to participate, etc. The composition of farmers' association cadres is sometimes not pure. (3) In areas where the peasant masses have not yet been mobilized, landlords and heads of reactionary secret societies have created some fake farmers' associations.
    In order to further mobilize the peasant masses and prepare for land reform, various localities are now rectifying the organization of farmers' associations and the work style of cadres, and have achieved considerable results. The work of rectifying farmers' associations in various places can generally be combined with the current central work, and after conducting in-depth investigations, they engage in organizational rectification. At the same time, class education is carried out for members when developing membership. When dealing with the relationship between cadres and the masses, praise and criticism can also be combined. This not only consolidates the organization of farmers' associations and raises the awareness of the peasant masses, but also completes the current central task, enabling the movement to further develop. Some local farmers' associations do not combine with the current work and simply conduct organizational rectification. During the rectification, they do not conduct investigation and research, do not patiently listen to the opinions of the masses, and act rashly based only on one-sided materials. As a result, they are easily exploited by landlords and bad elements to attack the cadres of the farmers' associations. Various localities have now paid attention to correcting this bias.
    Fujian Peasants Have Participated in the Revolutionary Struggle for a Long Time, and Now 700,000 People Have Joined the Farmers' Association
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The first Fujian Provincial Farmers' Representative Conference, representing more than 9 million farmers in the province, was held in Fuzhou at the end of June. At the meeting, through elections, the Fujian Provincial Farmers' Association was formally established.
    Fujian peasants have been carrying out revolutionary struggles under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party since the Great Revolution era, and have experienced countless hardships in the past 26 years. In October last year, after the entire mainland of Fujian Province was liberated, they carried out tasks such as suppressing bandits, supporting the front, collecting grain, reducing rent, and preparing for production and famine under the leadership of the People's Government. The broad masses of peasants have gradually organized in various struggles. At present, among the more than 9,000 "bao" in the province, 5,113 "bao" have established farmers' associations. The total number of farmers' association members in the province has reached 740,000 (including more than 100,000 female members). In special districts such as Fuan, Minhou, and Quanzhou, more than 70% of districts and villages have established farmers' associations. There are 13 township farmers' associations and 96 "bao" farmers' associations in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, with a total of more than 28,700 members. On the basis of organizing the peasants, more than 50,000 people's militia forces have been established in the province, and the "bao-jia" system has been destroyed in one-third of the province, and rural political power has been established. Sixty-two of the province's sixty-seven counties have held farmers' representative conferences.
    In the past nine months, in addition to strengthening the ranks of the peasants, rent reduction movements have been carried out in 70% of the areas in Fujian Province. According to incomplete statistics from 1,826 "bao", 11 million catties of rent grain have been reduced, solving the difficulties of spring famine for some of the masses. More than 30,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the province, and 882 water conservancy projects have been built, which can increase grain production by more than 40 million catties. The province has also launched labor exchange and mutual assistance and sideline production, so that wheat has generally been harvested this year. All of this has laid a good foundation for the province to further expand the rent reduction movement, develop production, and implement land reform in some areas.
    The Fujian Provincial People's Government has decided to implement land reform in Minhou Special District (including the suburbs of Fuzhou City) this winter and next spring. The remaining areas will continue to carry out tasks such as suppressing bandits, supporting the liberation of Jinmen and Taiwan, reducing rent and opposing local bullies, and developing production, and consolidate and develop farmers' association organizations. It is expected that by the end of this year, the province will develop farmers' association membership to 1.5 million, preparing sufficient conditions for the province's future land reform work.

　　江西福建举行农民代表会议
    正式成立两省的农民协会
    两省大部分地区农民已经组织起来
    江西农民代表详细讨论土改法提出土改实施细则的初步意见
    【新华社南昌十九日电】江西省第一届农民代表会议已于七月五日至十六日在南昌市举行。出席代表七百五十二人。会议通过了江西省农民协会组织章程，制订了江西省农民协会斗争纲领，并选出刘俊秀、方志纯等七十七人为省农民协会委员，正式成立了江西省农民协会。会议对《中华人民共和国土地改革法》进行了逐字逐句的讨论。讨论中代表们控诉了地主阶级残酷的封建剥削，表示一致拥护土地改革法，认为土地改革法是农民的翻身大法，要好好学习，认真执行。会议根据土地改革法的基本精神和江西省的具体情况，提出了江西省土地改革实施细则的初步意见。该项意见已报请省人民政府审查，以便公布施行。经过研究的结果，会议认为江西省农村今冬可在七百万到八百万人口的地区进行土地改革。代表们又讨论了土地改革的具体准备工作，决定在今冬实行土地改革的地区，现在必须进一步发动群众，贯彻反对恶霸和减租的运动，并整理和扩大农民协会组织，克服过去农民协会组织工作上存在着的关门主义和形式主义的偏向，把占农村人口百分之九十的劳动农民组织到农民协会中来。今年冬天不实行土地改革的地区则应在全面开展反对恶霸运动和生产运动中，发动和组织农民群众，为明年实行土地改革创造有利条件。会议并决定写信给毛主席，保证切实遵照中华人民共和国土地改革的正确方针，协同全省广大农民，有步骤地、有秩序地进行土地改革，发展生产。
    江西农民协会蓬勃发展会员已达一百三十万人
    【新华社南昌十九日电】经过将近一年的农村社会改革运动，江西省农民协会已获得很大的发展。据不完全统计：截至六月中旬，全省已有一万二千八百五十五个行政村建立了农民协会，占全省行政村数的百分之八十一点二，农民协会会员约有一百三十多万人。现在江西省农民协会已在南昌成立；浮梁专区农民协会也已于六月初成立。
    一年来江西各地的农民协会，在清剿土匪、反对恶霸、减租退租、合理负担、春耕生产等各项工作中，都起了很大的作用。但由于工作发展迅速，没有及时地进行教育工作和整理组织的工作，各地农民协会组织中还存在着一些问题。目前各地农民协会大致可分三种类型：（一）在农民群众已经初步发动的地区，农民协会干部成份一般较好；但是由于教育不够，内部缺乏民主制度，有些干部存在着强迫命令的不良作风，甚至有随便扣人、罚人等违犯政策的行动；以致干部脱离群众，或者干部和群众关系不够协调。（二）在农民群众稍经发动的地区，农民协会普遍地存在着形式主义或关门主义倾向。有的是以农民群众大会代替农民协会；有的对入会条件规定过苛，只吸收贫农和雇农入会，或规定入会要有候补期，或每家只准一人参加等。农民协会干部成份有的也不纯洁。（三）在农民群众尚未发动的地区，地主、反动会门头子制造了一些假农民协会。
    为了进一步发动农民群众，作好土地改革的准备工作，现在各地正在进行整顿农民协会组织和干部的作风，并且已收到不少成绩。各地整顿农民协会的工作一般都能结合当前中心工作进行，经深入调查情况后，再从事组织上的整理。同时并在发展会员时进行对会员的阶级教育。在处理干部和群众的关系问题时，也能将表扬与批评相结合。这样既巩固了农民协会组织，提高了农民群众的觉悟，同时也完成了目前中心任务，使运动能够进一步开展。有些地方的农民协会不结合当前工作，单纯地进行组织整理。整顿中又不调查研究，不耐心听取群众意见，仅凭借片面材料，草率从事。结果就容易被地主和坏分子利用来打击农民协会的干部。这个偏向，各地现已注意纠正。
    福建农民长期参加革命斗争现在已有七十万人加入农会
    【本报讯】代表全省九百余万农民的福建省第一届农民代表会议，六月底在福州举行。会上经过选举，正式成立了福建省农民协会。
    福建农民从大革命时代起，就在中国共产党领导下进行革命斗争，二十六年来经历了无数的艰辛。去年十月，福建省大陆全部解放后，又在人民政府领导下，进行了剿匪、支前、征粮、减租、生产备荒等工作。广大农民已在各种斗争中逐渐组织起来。目前全省九千多个保中，已有五千一百十三个保建立了农民协会。全省农民协会会员共达七十四万人（内妇女会员有十万人以上）。福安、闽侯、泉州等专区，成立了农民协会的区村，已在百分之七十以上。福州市郊区有十三个乡农民协会，九十六个保农民协会，共有会员二万八千七百余人。在农民组织起来的基础上，全省建立了五万多人的民兵武装，并摧毁了全省三分之一地区的保甲制度，建立了乡村政权。全省六十七县中已有六十二县召开过农民代表会议。
    九个月来，除壮大了农民队伍以外，福建全省已有百分之七十的地区进行了减租运动。据一千八百二十六个保的不完全统计，已减回租谷一千一百万斤，解决了部分群众春荒的困难。全省开荒三万多亩，并兴修水利八百八十二处，共计可增产粮食四千万斤以上。该省同时开展了变工互助和副业生产，使今年麦子普遍得到丰收。这一切，为全省进一步展开减租运动，发展生产和在部分地区实行土地改革打下了良好的基础。
    福建省人民政府已决定今冬和明春在闽侯专区（包括福州市郊）实行土地改革。其余地区仍继续进行清剿土匪，支援解放金门、台湾，减租反霸，发展生产等工作，并巩固和发展农会组织，预计到今年年底止，全省将发展农会会员到一百五十万人，为今后全省土地改革工作准备充分条件。
