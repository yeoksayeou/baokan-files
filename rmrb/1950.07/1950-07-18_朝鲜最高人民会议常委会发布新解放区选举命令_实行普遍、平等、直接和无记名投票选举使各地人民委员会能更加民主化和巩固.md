Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decree on the 15th regarding the implementation of elections for county, district, and township people's committees in the newly liberated areas of the Republic's southern half. The decree states: The people of the Republic's southern half, liberated from the rule of the Li Seung-man bandit gang due to the heroic fighting of the People's Army, have automatically restored their own political organs – the people's committees – which were forcibly disbanded by the pro-American and pro-Li reactionary forces. In order to make the people's committees more democratic and consolidated, it is decided to implement universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot elections in the newly liberated areas.

The county, district, and township elections will be held based on the following principles: All Korean citizens who have reached the age of twenty, regardless of gender, ethnicity, class background, belief, length of residence, property, or level of knowledge, have the right to vote and to be elected, with the exception of pro-Japanese and pro-American elements and the mentally ill.

In order to carry out this work correctly, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea has specially appointed nine people, including Kim Won-bong, to form the Central Election Guidance Department.

    发布新解放区选举命令
    实行普遍、平等、直接和无记名投票选举使各地人民委员会能更加民主化和巩固
    【新华社平壤十七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会，十五日发布关于在共和国南半部新解放地区实施县、区、乡人民委员会选举的法令。该令称：由于人民军的英勇作战而从李承晚匪帮的统治下获得解放的共和国南半部人民，已自动恢复曾被美李反动势力迫令解散的朝鲜人民自己的政权机关——人民委员会。为使人民委员会更加民主化和巩固，特决定在新解放地区实施普遍、平等、直接和无记名投票的选举。
    县、区、乡的选举系根据下列原则举行：凡年满二十岁的朝鲜公民，除亲日和亲美分子及精神病患者外，不分性别、民族、阶级成份、信仰、居住年限、财产及知识程度如何，均有选举权和被选举权。
    为正确地进行这一工作，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会特委任金元凤等九人组成中央选举指导部。
