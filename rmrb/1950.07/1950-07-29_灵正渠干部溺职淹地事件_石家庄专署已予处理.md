To the Editors:

　　Regarding the article "Mishandling of Drowning Incident by Lingzheng Canal Cadres Resulted in Flooding; 400 Mu of Good Farmland Turned into Swamps" published in the People's Forum on May 26th, the Prefecture immediately sent personnel to Lingzheng Canal and related departments and villages for serious inspection. The reason for the flooding, as mentioned in the newspaper, was indeed due to the bureaucratic work style of the cadres. For example, Yao Shuzhai (previously mistakenly written as Yao Luoshu), the director of the Lingzheng Canal General Association, only conducted an inspection at the cadre meeting before the water release. He was unclear about whether the canal layout was good or what the inspection situation was like. At the same time, he was blindly optimistic, believing that Lingzheng Canal was an old canal with many years of history and that no problems would arise. Therefore, he relaxed the strict inspection of the canal, resulting in successive flooding incidents. In addition to this, there are two other reasons: (1) Confusion in water usage and failure to seriously implement the agreement. First of all, individual cadres of the canal were not serious about implementing the water usage agreement. They did not actively stop the masses from privately opening water inlets to irrigate their land, but instead accommodated the masses. This formed a chaotic phenomenon of privately opening water inlets and closing sluice gates. Secondly, individual county cadres only considered the current interests of some of the masses and ignored the management of the entire canal. Some of the masses requested to irrigate white land to grow soybeans, and some cadres believed that this was in line with the production call from above and in accordance with the interests of the masses, so they allowed the masses' request at a meeting of party members and cadres. This led to the inability to implement the water usage agreement. (2) The canal cadres had successively handed over or reported those who privately opened water inlets to the district government, but the district government did not deal with them, and the county government did not pay attention to it in time. In this way, the canal cadres were unable to control the situation, and they relaxed their management.

    Based on the above situation, the Prefecture instructed the canal to convene a meeting of water conservancy committee members and representatives from seventeen beneficiary villages on June 22nd, which was presided over by the construction section chiefs of Zheng and Ling counties, with personnel from the Prefecture participating. At the meeting, Yao Shuzhai and the construction section chiefs of Zheng and Ling counties all made self-criticisms, and through democratic discussion, the personnel who neglected their duties were punished: Liang Shikui, as the chief of the water management section of the General Association, did not actively go to lead the masses to block the breach after the villagers reported it, and was given a criticism. Jia Chun, who privately opened water inlets, was irresponsible in his work, and engaged in embezzlement, was removed from his work and ordered to reflect. Kang Maosheng and other five people from Yihezhuang were fined several days of voluntary labor. At the same time, the meeting revised the water usage agreement, formulated a new water usage system, and the two counties guaranteed its implementation, so as to avoid further disputes, in order to achieve fair and reasonable rotational irrigation, save water, and increase production.

　　灵正渠干部溺职淹地事件
    石家庄专署已予处理编者同志：
    五月二十六日人民园地发表《灵正渠干部溺职，良田四百亩成泽国》一文后，专署即派员亲到灵正渠及有关部门与村庄进行认真检查。其淹地原因，正如报上所说的，是由于干部存在官僚主义作风所致。如灵正渠总会主任姚淑斋（前误为姚洛淑），在放水前只在干部会上作了检查。渠道的布置是否很好？检查情形如何？他是不清楚的。同时他盲目地乐观，认为灵正渠是多年的老渠道，不会出什么问题。因而放松了对渠道的严密检查。造成接连淹地情事。除此以外，还有下面两个原因：（一）使水混乱，未认真执行公约。首先是该渠的个别干部，对执行使水公约不严肃。见到群众私开水口浇地，未积极制止，而迁就群众。就形成私开水口，起闭闸板的混乱现象。其次是，个别县干部只顾部分群众的目前利益忽略整个渠道的管理。部分群众要求浇白地种菀豆，部分干部认为这是符合上级生产号召，又合乎群众利益，就在党员干部会上允许了群众的要求。致不能执行使水公约。（二）渠上干部曾先后把私自开口使水的人送交或报告区政府，区政府竟未给以处理，县府亦未及时注意。这样，渠上干部就无法掌握，也就放松了管理。
    根据以上情况，专署指示该渠于六月二十二日召开了十七个受益村水利委员及代表开会，由正、灵两县建设科长主持、专署派人参加。在会上姚淑斋和正、灵两县建设科长都作了检讨，并通过民主讨论，处分失职人员：梁世魁身为总会使水管理股长，在村民报告决口后，未积极前往领导群众堵口，给以批评处分。私开水口、工作不负责任、并有贪污行为的贾春，则撤消其工作，令其反省。义合庄康茂生等五人罚做几天义务工。同时，会上修改了使水公约，制定了新的使水制度，由两县保证其执行，以免再起纠纷，以达到公平合理的轮流灌溉、节省用水、增加生产的目的。
