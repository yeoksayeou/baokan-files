　　Ensuring Production Safety and Improving Recovery Rate
    State-Owned Coal Mines Trial New Coal Mining Method
    For half a year, accidents have decreased, efficiency has increased, costs have been reduced, and a large amount of national funds has been saved.
    [Our Newspaper's Report] For half a year, a new coal mining method has been trialed in some state-owned coal mines across the country, and significant results have been achieved. After the First National Coal Mine Conference decided to trial the new coal mining method, the Hegang mines in Northeast China and others have successively trialed it with the help of Soviet experts. The Fengfeng mines in North China and the Huainan mines in East China have also begun to trial it. The new coal mining method is the longwall method, in which coal miners are spread out on a line to mine together. When it advances toward the winch road, it is called the retreating longwall method. The advantage of this method is that, because the mined coalfield is left behind the miners, they are not subject to roof collapse (the rock above the coal seam – commonly known as the "roof") and injure people, and the recovery rate (i.e., the percentage of coal mined compared to the reserves) is also high. When using the longwall method and encountering thick coal seams, methods such as layered mining, middle layer collapse, and inverted staircase are implemented. Thick coal seams, ranging from three or four meters to twenty or thirty meters, are divided into several layers for mining, which can increase the recovery rate. During layered mining, a layer of six or seven meters thick is divided into three layers, using the middle layer collapse method or the inverted staircase method. The middle layer collapse method means that the upper and lower layers are mined one after the other, and the middle layer is recovered using the collapse method. The inverted staircase method means that the lower layer is in the front, the middle layer follows the lower layer, and the upper layer is in the back, forming an inverted staircase shape. During the above-mentioned mining methods, in order to control the rock above the coal seam (commonly known as the roof) and ensure work safety, the gangue (i.e., the stone mixed in with the coal) filling method is also implemented, which involves using gangue to build stone piers to fill the empty space where coal has been mined. As mining progresses, gangue filling is gradually extended to become a strip-shaped stone pier, which is the "strip-shaped filling method." The trial implementation of these methods has proven that they can ensure safe production and improve the recovery rate. State-owned coal mines are now absorbing experience and gradually promoting them. The results of implementing the new coal mining method are as follows:
    First of all, the recovery rate has been significantly improved. In the Hegang Coal Mine in Northeast China, layered mining, middle layer collapse, and inverted staircase three-stage recovery are implemented for coal seams six meters thick, using coal seam gangue as strip-shaped filling material. The general recovery rate has increased from about 30% to 60-80%. In the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China, the recovery rate of coal seams ten meters thick used to be only 34%. After all of them were changed to regular mining and layered mining, it reached 80-90%. In the Tongshun Well of the Fengfeng Mine in North China, the recovery rate of coal seams five meters thick used to be 50%, but it has increased to 85-90% in the new coal mining method trial. The Huainan Coal Mine in East China has also increased it to over 80%. The currently improved new coal mining method, in addition to the need to continue improving the filling aspect to achieve complete safety, the loss of underground resources has obviously been greatly reduced. Taking the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China as an example, if calculated based on the recovery rate before the reform, the mine would only have a lifespan of 15 and a half years, but after reforming the coal mining method, its lifespan can be extended to 40 years.
    Secondly, the safety guarantee in production has been greatly improved. Gas explosions and casualties from roof collapse and wall slippage accidents are relatively serious problems in coal mines, but as the coal mining method has changed, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, the average underground air volume was less than three cubic meters per person. Due to the adoption of the longwall coal mining method, the working face was extended to 60-100 meters, and the production was concentrated from tofu-like decentralized production, and the air volume was also concentrated, exceeding three cubic meters or even ten cubic meters per person. Because layered mining is implemented for thick coal seams, and strip-shaped filling is done with gangue, the accidents of collapse and wall slippage have been greatly reduced. Taking Hegang Nanshan as an example: Since the implementation of the new coal mining method last November, there have only been minor injuries during the initial trial period, and no casualties have occurred in the past six months. After the reform of the Xi'an Mine, the death rate per 10,000 tons was reduced from 1.1 to 0.5. Furthermore, because there is less coal abandoned underground, and with the addition of gangue filling, many spontaneous combustion accidents can be avoided. At the same time, because the strength of security personnel is concentrated, ventilation management is easy to carry out, and ventilation equipment is also easy to solve. In short, after the implementation of the new coal mining method, not only has production efficiency been improved, but more importantly, the danger in production has been greatly reduced, and the life safety of employees has been further guaranteed.
    Third, efficiency has been improved, and manpower and material resources have been saved. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the overall efficiency of the Hegang Dongshan Mine was only about 0.3-0.4 tons. After liberation, due to the active production of miners, the overall efficiency has reached 0.51 tons. However, after reforming the production method, it reached 0.82 tons in May of this year, an increase of more than double compared to the puppet Manchukuo period, and an increase of about 60% compared to before the reform, which resulted in a great saving of labor. Hegang originally had 4,020 coal miners, and 800 people were saved after the initial concentrated production. If further concentration is carried out, the whole bureau will only need more than 2,000 coal miners. According to statistics from only five reformed sites in Shandong: in March, there were originally 4,599 workers, and in April, while maintaining the original output, it has been reduced to 3,905 workers. The Northeast Coal Mine Administration originally planned to supplement 7,000 workers this year, but now it is not only unnecessary, but also has a surplus. The Huainan Coal Mine originally had 19,000 people, and the entire mine can save 5,000 people after the reform, and it is estimated that it can even be saved to one-half. It is estimated that each mining area that is prepared to implement the reform in 1950 can save one-quarter of the labor force directly engaged in production and transfer it to other new jobs. In terms of tunneling, Jixi used some machines and improved the method of drilling and blasting to implement rapid road delivery, with an average daily advance of 4.44 meters, and the highest record reached 5.25 meters, an increase of more than double compared to the past. As for the national coal mines, the average winch horsepower required for each ton of coal is 1.93 horsepower, while the concentrated sites in the Northeast only need 0.89 horsepower. A coal cutting machine in the old-fashioned site of 30-40 meters only produced 96 tons of coal per day, while the reformed site in Hegang now produces more than 500 tons of coal per day.
    Fourth, it reduced costs and saved national funds. In the past, all mines felt that they lacked major machinery and equipment. However, after concentrated production, the general equipment is temporarily sufficient. Some materials and equipment in the Northeast mines are even surplus, and some can be allocated to other places. The same is true for the mines in North China that have implemented the new coal mining method. For example, the main materials needed for mine production, such as pit wood, detonators, and gunpowder, have been greatly saved due to the concentrated production. In the past, the Jiulonggang Mine in Huainan consumed 0.033 cubic meters of pit wood for every ton of coal produced, but now it only needs 0.024 cubic meters. In the past, the coal output capacity of each detonator in the fully mechanized site of the Hegang Mine was two tons, but now the coal output capacity of each detonator has reached five tons. In the past, 0.3 kilograms of gunpowder were required for each ton of coal, but now only 0.04 kilograms are required.
    Based on the above actual situation, it is estimated that after the implementation of the new coal mining method, the various equipment and manpower saved can reduce the cost of coal by about 17% compared to the original plan.
    This reform has just begun, and only 41 of the more than 4,000 coal mining sites across the country have implemented preliminary reform work. Even in these sites that have implemented preliminary reforms, there are still many shortcomings. For example, after the production method of the No. 4 Mine in Yangquan was reformed, production has been concentrated, but underground transportation has not been improved, and there is a phenomenon of coal accumulation. This shows that the overall reform is not enough. In addition, many cadres still have the work attitude of "seeking no merit, but seeking no fault" and the conservative thinking of not working hard to learn advanced technologies, which need to be greatly improved in the future.

　　保证生产安全提高回收率
    国营煤矿试行新法采煤
    半年来，事故减少，效率提高，成本减低，节省了大量国家资金。
    【本报讯】半年来，全国部分国营煤矿，试行新的采煤方法，已获显著成绩。第一次全国煤矿会议决定试行新的采煤方法后，经苏联专家的帮助，东北鹤岗等矿已相继试行。华北峰峰、华东淮南等矿亦已开始试行。新的采煤方法是长壁式。即采煤的镐手散布在一条线上一起采掘。有向绞车道掘进的，即名为后退长壁式。这种方法的好处是，因为采过的煤场留在采掘者的后面，不致遭受冒顶（煤层上面的岩石——俗名“顶板”——塌下）而伤人，而且回收率（即采出的煤与蕴藏量的百分比）也高。采用长壁式方法，遇到厚煤层时，则实行分层采掘、中层塌陷、倒楼梯式等方法。厚煤层有达三、四公尺到二、三十公尺的，即分成几层采掘，可以提高回收率。在分层采掘时，六七公尺厚分为三层，用中层陷落法或倒楼梯式。中层陷落法，即是上下两层一前一后地采掘，中层则用陷落法回收。倒楼梯式法，即是下层在最前，中层随下层之后，而上层则在最后，形成了倒楼梯状。在上述方法掘进中，为控制煤层上面的岩石（俗名顶板），保障工作安全，又实行了矸石（即夹在煤里的石头）充填方法，即是用矸石砌成石垛，填充已采过煤的空场。随着采掘的进展，矸石充填亦逐渐延长，成为带状的石垛，即为“带状充填法”。这些方法的试行，已证明能保障安全生产和提高回收率，现国营煤矿已在吸取经验，逐步推广。实行新采煤方法的成绩如下：
    首先是回收率已显著提高。东北鹤冈煤矿对六公尺厚的煤层实行分层采掘，中层塌陷及倒楼梯式三段回收，用煤层矸石作带状充填材料，一般的回收率已由百分之三十左右提高到百分之六十——八十。东北西安煤矿十公尺厚的煤层过去回收率仅百分之三十四，全部改为正规回采与分层采掘后，达到百分之八十——九十。华北峰峰矿通顺井五公尺厚的煤层过去回收率为百分之五十，在新采煤方法的试验中已提高到百分之八十五——九十。华东淮南煤矿也提高到百分之八十以上。现行改进的新采煤方法，除充填方面尚需继续改进以求得彻底安全外，地下资源的损失显然已经大量的减少。以东北西安煤矿为例，如以改革前的回收率计算，该矿仅余十五年半的寿命，但在改革采煤方法之后，则可使其寿命延长到四十年。
    其次，对生产上的安全保障有极大的改善。瓦斯爆炸，冒顶片帮塌陷的伤亡事故，在煤矿中本是比较严重的问题，但随着采煤方法的改变，情况起了基本变化。过去井下风量每人平均不足三立方公尺，由于采取了长壁式采煤方法，工作面延长到六○——一○○公尺，由豆腐块式的分散生产到集中，风量亦行集中，每人已超过三立方公尺甚至十立方公尺以上。由于对厚煤层实行分层采掘，并以矸石做带状充填，因之陷落冒顶片帮的事故大为减少。以鹤冈南山为例：自去年十一月实行新采煤方法后，仅在开始试验期间有过轻伤，至今半年来一直未发生过伤亡事故。西安矿自改革后，由每万吨死亡一·一人减为○·五人。更因为井下遗弃的煤少，再加以矸石充填，可以免掉许多自然发火的事故。同时由于保安人员力量集中，通风管理容易进行，通风设备亦易于解决。总之，新采煤方法实行后，不仅提高了生产效率，而更重要的是大大地减少了生产中的危险性，对职工的生命安全给予了进一步的保障。
    第三，提高了效率，节省了人力和物力。鹤冈东山矿在伪满时期的全员效率仅○·三——○·四吨左右。解放后，由于矿工积极生产，全员效率已达○·五一吨。但在改革生产方法后，今年五月即达到○·八二吨，较伪满时期提高一倍以上，较改革前提高百分之六十左右，因之劳动力有了很大的节省。鹤冈原有采煤工四、○二○人，初步集中生产后即节省了八○○人，如再进一步的集中，全局只要二千多采煤工就够了。山东仅以改革后的五个场子统计：三月份原有四、五九九个工，四月份在维持原产量下已减少到三、九○五个工。东北煤矿管理局原计划今年补充七千工人，现在不但不需要了，并且还有多余。淮南煤矿原有一九、○○○人，改革后全矿可节省五、○○○人，据估计甚至可省到二分之一。准备在一九五○年实行改革的各矿区，估计可节省出四分之一的直接生产的劳动力，转移到其他新的工作岗位上去。掘进方面，鸡西利用了一部分机器，和改善打眼放炮的方法，实行快速送道，每日平均前进四·四四公尺，最高纪录到了五·二五公尺，较过去提高了一倍以上。至于国营各矿的绞车马力平均每出一吨煤需一·九三匹，在东北集中后的场子只需○·八九匹。裁煤机在三○——四○公尺的旧式场子内，每日只出煤九十六吨，在鹤冈改革后的场子现已每日出煤五○○吨以上。
    第四，减低成本，节省了国家资金。对于主要的机器设备，过去各矿都感到缺乏。但在集中生产以后，一般的暂时都已够用了。东北各矿有些器材且有富裕，可以向外调拨一部分。华北已实行新采煤方法的各矿也有同样情形。例如矿山生产所需要的主要材料如坑木、雷管、炮药等，由于集中生产的关系，都有大量的节省。淮南九龙岗矿过去每产一吨煤要消耗坑木○·○三三立方公尺，现在只需○·○二四立方公尺了。鹤岗矿全部机械化的场子过去每个雷管的出煤能力是二吨，现在每个雷管的出煤能力已达到五吨。过去每吨煤需火药○·三公斤，现在只需○·○四公斤。
    根据上述这些实际情况，估计推行新采煤方法后，所节省下来的各项器材和人工，可使煤的成本较原计划降低百分之十七左右。
    这一改革刚在开始，全国四千多个采煤场子中仅有四十一个实行了初步的改革工作。就在这些实行初步改革的场子中，也还有不少缺点。如阳泉第四矿生产方法改革之后，生产已集中了，但井下运输却没有改善，存在使煤量堆滞的现象。这表现了全面的改革还不够。此外，在不少干部中还有“不求有功，但求无过”的工作态度及不努力学习先进技术的保守思想，这些都是需要今后大力改进的。
