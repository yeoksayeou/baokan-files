　　To the Editor:
    Since your publication released the letter from Soviet women to their Chinese sisters in June, we have continuously received many letters from female comrades written to their Soviet sisters, expressing their ardent willingness to become close revolutionary friends with them. We are now forwarding Comrade Su Jin’s reply – from a female cadre working in the military – for your publication.
                   To Comrade Leniida Yushakhiva:
    It was with extreme pleasure that I read your letter published in the newspaper, and I have decided to write this letter to you. From now on, we shall be close friends.
    I am twenty-one years old this year, and I am currently serving as a political instructor in a unit. I joined the revolution in 1944. In these seven years, I have not left the front lines for a single day. I participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Surrender Ceremony, and I also participated in the War of Liberation. In 1948, I also participated in the Huaihai Campaign, which annihilated 650,000 enemies. At that time, I served as a front-line medical assistant and was responsible for taking in tens of thousands of prisoners of war.
    Comrade Yushakhiva, we are both young people advancing towards the same goal, and staunch soldiers defending world peace. The close unity of China and the Soviet Union, two great nations, is the guarantee of world peace. At present, more than 27 million people in China have signed the peace petition, and the number of signatories is still constantly increasing. This is a serious warning to the warmongers: whoever dares to invade us will suffer the fate of failure.
    Dear Comrade Yushakhiva, if you can write to me, I will definitely send you an extremely precious item – a "Huaihai Campaign Commemorative Medal." I believe you will be very happy to see it.
    Let us shake hands warmly, and wish the great forces of peace victory in advance! Finally, I extend warm greetings to all the sisters in the Soviet Union!
                  Your new friend, Su Jin

### 写给苏联姐妹的一封回信

　　写给苏联姐妹的一封回信编者同志：
    自六月份贵刊发表了苏联妇女给中国姐妹们的来信以后，我们曾陆续收到了许多妇女同志写给苏联姐妹的回信，热烈表示愿意和他们做革命的密友。现将苏进同志——一位部队妇女工作者的复信转给你们发表。
                   中华全国民主妇联  莲依达·尤沙希娃同志：
    我以极愉快的心情，读了报纸上所刊登的你的来信后，决心写这封信给你。从此，我们将成为亲密的朋友。
    我今年二十一岁，现任机关连队的政治指导员。我是一九四四年参加革命的。七年中，我一天也未离开过前线。我曾参加了抗日战争和受降典礼，参加了解放战争。一九四八年，我还参加了歼灭六十五万敌人的淮海战役。当时，我担任前线的包扎员，并做着收容成千成万的俘虏兵的工作。
    尤沙希娃同志，我们都是向着同一目标进军的青年，保卫世界和平的坚强战士。中苏两大国家的亲密团结，是世界和平的保障。目前，中国已有二千七百万以上的人在拥护和平签名书上签名，并且签名人数还在不断地增加。这对战争贩子是一个严重的警告：谁胆敢侵略我们，就将遭受失败的命运。
    亲爱的尤沙希娃同志，如果你能写信给我的话，我一定送你一件极珍贵的物品——“淮海战役纪念章”。我相信你看了一定会高兴的。
    让我们亲密地握手，预祝伟大的和平力量的胜利！最后，向苏联全体的姊妹们，致热烈的敬礼！        
                  你的新朋友苏进
                          （全国妇联新华分社来稿）
