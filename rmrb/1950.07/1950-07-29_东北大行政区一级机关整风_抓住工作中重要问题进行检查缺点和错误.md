Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th—The rectification movement in the first-level organs of the Northeast Greater Administrative Region has begun. Most departments held mobilization rallies for rectification at the beginning of this month; and in accordance with the spirit of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's instructions on rectification, determined that the rectification movement must be carried out around the current main work. All departments have established the principle that leading organs and responsible cadres should be rectified first. The Industry Department, Trade Department, and Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government have all formulated rectification plans based on the specific conditions of their respective departments. The responsible cadres of the Agriculture and Forestry Department also took charge of leading the inspection; earlier this month, they separately convened meetings of the water conservancy, animal husbandry, and agricultural technology departments to examine shortcomings and errors in their work. At the water conservancy meeting, the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau and responsible cadres from various provinces made self-criticisms. In addition, units such as the Finance Department and General Office of the Northeast People's Government, and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, have also been able to grasp important issues in their work and conduct reviews.

However, some shortcomings have already emerged in the rectification work of various units. For example, the rectification study in some organs is not combined with the main problems in the work of their departments; and issues such as studying documents, inspecting work, leaders taking responsibility, and combining with the Party branch have not been well resolved. In terms of the attitude towards rectification, there are also some ideological obstacles. For example, some middle and lower-level cadres believe that rectification has nothing to do with them and express negativity; responsible cadres with more shortcomings and errors have the phenomenon of suppressing criticism and covering up errors. Regarding the above shortcomings, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently convened a meeting of heads of various departments to report on the rectification situation, and has made preliminary studies and resolutions.

　　东北大行政区一级机关整风
    抓住工作中重要问题进行检查缺点和错误
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】东北大行政区一级机关的整风运动已经开始。多数部门均已于本月初先后召开整风动员大会；并根据中共中央东北局关于整风的指示的精神，确定了整风运动必须围绕当前主要工作进行。各部门都确定领导机关及负责干部首先整风的原则。东北人民政府工业部、贸易部和农林部都已根据各该部具体情况分别订出整风计划。农林部各负责干部并分工领导进行检查；本月上旬曾分别召开了水利、畜牧、农业技术三个部门的会议，检查工作中的缺点和错误。在水利会议上，东北水利总局及各省负责干部都作了自我批评。此外，东北人民政府财政部、办公厅和东北总工会等单位，亦能抓住工作中的重要问题，进行检讨。
    但目前各单位的整风工作已发生若干缺点，例如有些机关的整风学习未与本部门工作中的主要问题相结合；还有的对学习文件、检查工作和首长负责并与党的支部相结合等问题，也没有很好解决。在整风的态度上，也存在一些思想障碍，例如有些中下级干部认为整风同他们无关，表示消极；缺点错误较多的负责干部有压制批评、掩盖错误的现象。对于以上缺点，中共中央东北局近日召集各部门负责人举行会议，汇报整风情况，已作了初步的研究和解决。
