　　Korean People's Army
    Liberates Incheon Military Port, Annihilating Over 9,000 Enemies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th] According to a communiqué issued by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the morning of the 5th: The Korean People's Army completely liberated the important military port of Incheon, located more than 30 kilometers southwest of Seoul, at 12:30 on the 4th. A unit of the People's Army, which was attacking Incheon City, surrounded an enemy army corps that continued to resist stubbornly under the cover of U.S. Air Force formations, and then launched an encirclement and annihilation battle. As a result, the enemy army was completely wiped out or forced to surrender. Incheon City was thus liberated.

    In the battle to liberate Incheon City, the People's Army killed or wounded more than 7,000 enemies, captured more than 2,000 enemies, and seized a large number of spoils of war. Detailed results are being checked.

    The people of Incheon warmly welcomed the entry of the People's Army.

    Incheon City has a deep harbor facing the sea and controls the capital internally. It is one of the three major ports of Korea, along with Busan and Wonsan. In the past two years, the United States has continuously dispatched fleets to Incheon Port to suppress the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people's guerrillas. After Truman issued his shameless statement on the 27th of last month, the U.S. fleet attempted to land at the port. After the liberation of Seoul, the U.S. again used large formations of air force planes to cover Li Seung-man's puppet army in stubborn resistance, but the heroic Korean People's Army completely occupied Incheon Port six days after the liberation of Seoul.

　　朝鲜人民军
    解放仁川军港  歼敌九千余名
    【新华社平壤五日电】据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部五日晨发表公报称：朝鲜人民军已于四日十二时三十分将汉城西南三十余公里的重要军港仁川市完全解放。进攻仁川市的人民军某部于包围了在美空军编队掩护下继续顽抗的敌军兵团后，展开围歼战，结果将敌军完全消灭或迫使投降。仁川市遂告解放。
    人民军在解放仁川市的战役中计毙伤敌七千余名，俘敌两千余名，卤获战利品极多，详细战果在清查中。
    仁川市人民热烈地欢迎了人民军的入城。
    按仁川市外临深港，内控首都，与釜山、元山并称朝鲜三大港。美国在过去的两年中，曾不断地派遣舰队驶往仁川港，以镇压南朝鲜人民游击队的爱国斗争。上月廿七日杜鲁门发表无耻的声明后，美舰队曾企图在该港登陆。汉城解放后，美又以大批空军机群掩护李承晚的伪军负嵎顽抗，但英雄的朝鲜人民军在解放汉城六天后，终将仁川港完全占领。
