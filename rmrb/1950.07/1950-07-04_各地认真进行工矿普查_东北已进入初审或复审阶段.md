Vigorous Industrial and Mining Census Conducted in Various Locations; Northeast Enters Preliminary or Secondary Review Stage

[This newspaper dispatch] All localities across the country are diligently implementing the directive of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the industrial and mining enterprise census. Most areas in the Northeast have completed the initial drafting and have entered the preliminary or secondary review stage. The Lüda area [Dalian and Lüshun] is scheduled to complete the formal filling-out of forms before the end of June. The Southwest's industrial and mining census commenced on April 20th and is scheduled to submit a comprehensive statistical report to the central government by the end of August. The Central South region's industrial and mining enterprise census is scheduled to be completed by July 15th. The Northwest region is also striving to complete the census on schedule. The census work in North and East China is also being vigorously carried out.

Under the leadership of the financial and economic committees at all levels, major administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities have established census committees to uniformly lead the census work. Census work groups have also been established to inspect and assist factories and mines, focusing on key areas or巡回inspections, and to absorb and exchange experiences. Prior to the census, many regions first organized cadres to study census documents and research methods for filling out census forms, thus enabling the smooth resolution of difficulties encountered in the census work.

At the beginning of the census work, various ideological resistances were encountered in various places: Some leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises, failing to consider long-term interests, used "busy" and "difficult to collect materials" as excuses, attempting to delay the census work. Others lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of the census work and acted carelessly, resulting in inaccurate reporting. There were also some leading cadres who did not carefully review the reports submitted by their subordinates before submitting them, resulting in inaccurate reports that required re-investigation, causing significant waste of time and manpower.

The census work also revealed some weaknesses in past work. Due to the lack of precise statistics and systematic accumulation of materials in factories and mining enterprises during normal times, some of the figures in the reports were inaccurate. In addition, insufficient preparation for the census work and a lack of strong sense of responsibility among some cadres further exacerbated the carelessness and inaccuracy of the investigation. For example, some factories and mines in Heilongjiang Province estimated the current value of power equipment to be one and a half times greater than the existing capital, and reported the constructed area to be greater than the area occupied by the enterprise. Some factories in Lanzhou filled in the "depreciation rate and current status" column with vague phrases such as "long-term disrepair, poor condition." In Jilin, contradictions have been found in the related parts of the forms filled out by some units. If these errors are not corrected during the review, they will lead to huge losses in future planning work.

Objective difficulties exist in the census work, such as incomplete past production records, incomplete historical materials, lack of understanding of capital and unit prices, and unclear specifications. Some small factories and mines and small and medium-sized cities even lack technicians, specialized statisticians, and surveyors, making it very difficult for various localities to fill out information on "driving capacity," "nominal and actual," "power consumption," and to draw blueprints and sketches. However, these difficulties can be overcome as long as one is able to study diligently, investigate deeply, and closely integrate leaders and the masses.

The experiences of industrial and mining enterprises in various places in the census work have proven that in order to do a good job in the census work, the following points must be achieved: (1) There must be organization and leadership. Census committees or census groups should be established in various localities and in various industrial and mining enterprises. The person in charge should personally lead, make specific plans, and summarize and exchange experiences at any time. (2) The census work is a complex organizational work with a high degree of technicality. Therefore, the census agency should organize the comrades from the relevant departments of technology, equipment, raw materials, accounting, personnel, etc. to participate. (3) The comrades participating in the investigation must study the census documents and various form instructions in detail, collect various relevant materials, and make good preparations. (4) Mobilize the internal forces of industrial and mining enterprises, humbly learn from veteran workers and technicians, deeply study and discuss, and grasp the mass line. (5) Factories and mines and cities should strengthen ties, learn from each other, and exchange experiences. Superiors and subordinates should be mutually responsible and pay attention to review.

　　各地认真进行工矿普查
    东北已进入初审或复审阶段
    【本报讯】全国各地工矿企业普遍认真地执行中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于工矿企业普查的训令。东北各地多已完成草填工作，进入初审或复审阶段；旅大区则定于六月底以前完成正式填写工作。西南工矿普查已于四月二十日开始，定八月底将综合统计报告送达中央。中南区工矿企业的普查工作定于七月十五日完成。西北区也争取如期完成普查。华北、华东的普查工作也在大力进行中。
    在各级财经委员会的领导下，各大行政区和省、市均建立了普查委员会，统一领导普查工作。并成立了普查工作小组，有重点地或巡回到各厂矿检查与帮助进行工作，吸取并交流经验。很多地区在普查之前，并首先组织干部学习普查文件，研究普查表格填报方法，因而使普查工作中发生的困难得以顺利解决。
    各地在普查工作开始时，曾遇到各种思想抵抗：若干厂矿企业的领导干部不从长远利益出发，而以“忙”、“不易搜集材料”等作借口，想把普查工作拖延下去；有的则对普查工作的重要性认识不足，草率从事，所填表报不够准确；也有部分领导干部，对下级表报不细致审查，即行上报，致因表报不精确，需要重新调查，造成时间和人力的很大浪费。
    在普查工作中，同时也暴露出过去工作中的一些弱点。由于厂矿企业在平日缺少精密的统计，缺少有系统的累积材料，因而使表报中的有些数字不准确。再加上普查工作的准备不足，有些干部的责任心不强，更增加了工作潦草和调查不精确的缺陷。如黑龙江一部分厂矿，填报动力设备的现值估计，超过现有资本一倍半，填报已建筑面积，超过了企业所占面积。兰州有的工厂在“折旧率及现况”一栏内填上“年久失修、情况不佳”等笼统含忽的字样。吉林若干单位所填表格，在各表关连部分已发现矛盾现象。假如这些错误在审查时没有被纠正，就会招致今后计划工作上的巨大损失。
    普查工作中的客观困难是存在的，例如过去生产纪录不完整，历史材料不齐备，资金、单价不了解，规格分类不明确；若干小厂矿和中小城市甚至没有技师，没有专门的统计人员，没有测绘员，因而各地对填报“驱动能力”、“公称、实际”、“耗电量”及绘制蓝图、草图等感到很大困难。但是只要能刻苦研究，深入调查，领导和群众密切结合，这些困难是可以克服的。
    各地工矿企业在普查工作中的经验证明，要做好普查工作，必须做到下面各点：（一）必须有组织有领导。各地及各工矿企业均应成立普查委员会或普查组，负责人应亲自领导，做出具体计划，随时总结、交流经验。（二）普查工作是一个复杂的组织工作，含有高度的技术性，因此普查机构应将技术、设备、原材料、会计、人事等各有关部门的工作同志组织进去。（三）参加调查工作的同志，必须详细研究普查文件及各种表格说明，搜集各种有关资料，做好准备工作。（四）动员工矿企业内部的力量，虚心向老工友与技术人员学习，深切研讨，掌握群众路线。（五）各厂矿之间，城市之间应加强联系，互相学习，交流经验。上级与下级之间要互相负责，重视审查。
