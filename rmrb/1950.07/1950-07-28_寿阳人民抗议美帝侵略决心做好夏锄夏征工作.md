　　Shouyang People Protest American Aggression and Resolve to Do a Good Job in Summer Weeding and Summer Grain Collection
    [Our Newspaper] The People's Representative Conference of Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, sent a telegram on July 12 to protest against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, and to support the Korean people. The telegram stated: "The people of Shouyang are extremely indignant upon hearing the news of American aggression against our Taiwan Province and Korea. Taiwan is the Taiwan of our Chinese people, and it has been affirmed by the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. This unreasonable action of American imperialism is a continuation of the violation of our Chinese territorial sovereignty. We, the representatives of the Shouyang People's Congress, representing the will of the 160,000 people of Shouyang, resolutely support the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou on June 28. We will never be intimidated by the paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. We are determined to unite closely with the people of the whole country and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and all Chinese territories. Furthermore, we will work with the people of the whole county to do a good job in summer weeding, deliver good grain for the summer grain collection, and publicize the aggressive crimes of the American war criminal Truman anytime and anywhere, and support the just struggle of the North Korean people."
