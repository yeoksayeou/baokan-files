Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently received letters from democratic women's organizations in Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Lebanon, and French Ivory Coast, forwarded by the Women's International Democratic Federation, detailing the brutal suppression and persecution carried out by the reactionary governments of these countries against their movements to defend world peace and fight for democratic rights. They issued an appeal to women worldwide, demanding that sisters in all countries raise a strong protest to "defend democratic rights and protect the most basic human rights." Cai Chang, chairwoman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a letter of condolence and expressed that Chinese women firmly support their just struggle. The full text of the reply is as follows:

Dear Mrs. Kuczynski of the Women's International Democratic Federation,

From the airmail letter of the Secretariat dated May 30, we were shocked to learn of the atrocities that have occurred successively in Brazil, Lebanon, Ivory Coast, Iran, Argentina, Greece, Colombia, and other places, persecuting people and women striving for peace and democracy. Brazilian police opened fire on the May 1st International Labor Day parade, killing many women and children on the spot. Following the atrocities of the March 8th International Women's Day, the Lebanese government authorities illegally sentenced the responsible persons of the Women's Rights League to imprisonment and fines. The French colonial authorities in Ivory Coast arrested and abused children under the age of sixteen. The Iranian government shot and killed striking and demonstrating masses, and mistreated unemployed workers, causing hundreds of workers to die. After closing down democratic women's groups, the Argentine Peron government further arrested a large number of women, not sparing even a seventy-year-old woman and a two-month-old baby, and openly detained women who participated in the peace signature campaign. Even more appalling and outrageous events occurred in Colombia, where the Colombian government not only massacred and imprisoned people fighting for democracy, but also armed police raped democratic women, and even committed the shameless acts of raping girls aged seven to thirteen and sodomizing boys. Such inhuman atrocities cannot but arouse the utmost anger in anyone with humanity. The cruel and dark Makronisos concentration camp in Greece used inhuman tortures to torment millions of women and children who strive for democracy and freedom. This series of atrocities has aroused angry protests from peace-loving and democratic people in various countries around the world.

From these facts, we can clearly see the hideous faces of the imperialist vassals and reactionary puppet governments who oppose democratic rights, deprive people of their most basic human rights, and oppose world peace. At the same time, it also shows that the people's awareness is increasing day by day, and the struggle against oppression and aggressive war is becoming increasingly strengthened. The victory of the great revolution of the 475 million Chinese people has severely hit the imperialist conspiracy to launch aggressive war and greatly strengthened the forces of world peace and democracy. We are uniting closely with all peace-loving and democratic people to fight against aggressive war and for people's democracy and world peace.

We Chinese women express our deep concern and sympathy to our sisters and children who are suffering persecution. We will call on the people of the whole country to universally support their just struggle. We hope that the Secretariat will publish this letter in the news bulletin of the Women's International Democratic Federation so that our sisters in the heroic struggle can hear our voices of support.

With warm greetings,
     Cai Chang, Chairwoman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

　　我民主妇联函复国际民主妇联
    支援巴西等国民主妇女
    深切关怀和同情遭受迫害的姊妹和儿童
    【新华社五日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会最近收到国际民主妇联转来的哥伦比亚、巴西、伊朗、黎巴嫩、法属象牙海岸等国家民主妇女团体致国际民主妇联的信，信中申述了各国反动政府对她们所进行的保卫世界和平运动及争取民主权利施行的残酷镇压及迫害的情形。她们向全世界的妇女发出呼吁，要求各国姊妹们提出“保卫民主权利，保护最基本的人权”的强烈抗议。中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅特致函慰问，并表示中国妇女坚决支持她们的正义斗争，复信全文如下：国际民主妇联古久里夫人亲爱的朋友们：
    从书记处五月三十日的航信中，惊悉巴西、黎巴嫩、象牙海岸、伊朗、阿根廷、希腊、哥伦比亚等地，陆续发生迫害争取和平民主的人民与妇女的暴行。巴西警察开枪射击五一国际劳动节游行的队伍，当场打死妇孺多人。黎巴嫩政府当局继三八国际妇女节暴行之后，又非法判处妇女权利同盟的负责人以徒刑与罚金。象牙海岸法殖民当局拘捕并虐待十六岁以下的儿童。伊朗政府枪杀罢工示威的群众，虐待失业工人使成百工人死亡。阿根廷皮隆政府继封闭民主妇女团体之后，更进一步地逮捕大批妇女，连七十岁老太太和两个月的婴儿也不能幸免，并公然拘禁参加和平签名运动的妇女。哥伦比亚更发生了骇人听闻的残暴无耻的事件，哥伦比亚政府不只屠杀和囚禁争取民主的人民，而且发生了武装警察强奸民主妇女，甚至发生奸污七岁至十三岁的女孩和鸡奸男童的无耻行为。这种非人兽行，使任何具有人性的人，不能不愤怒万分。希腊的残酷黑暗的马克罗尼索集中营，用惨无人道的酷刑折磨争取民主自由的千百万妇女和儿童。这一系列的暴行都已引起了世界各国爱好和平民主人士的愤怒的抗议。
    从这些事实中，清楚地看到帝国主义的附庸，反动的傀儡政府，反对民主权利、剥夺人民最基本的人权、反对世界和平的狰狞面目；同时也说明了人民的觉悟日益提高，反对压迫、反对侵略战争的斗争之日益加强。四万万七千五百万中国人民大革命的胜利，沉重地打击了帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋，大大地加强了世界和平民主的力量。我们正在与一切爱好和平民主的人民紧密团结，为反对侵略战争，争取人民民主与世界和平而奋斗。
    我们中国妇女对于遭受迫害的姊妹和儿童表示深切的关怀与同情。我们要号召全国人民普遍地支援他们的正义斗争。希望书记处在国际民主妇联的消息公报上发表这封信，使广大的在英勇斗争中的姊妹们能够听到我们支援的呼声。此致热烈的敬礼
     中华全国民主妇女联合会主席  蔡畅
     七月五日
