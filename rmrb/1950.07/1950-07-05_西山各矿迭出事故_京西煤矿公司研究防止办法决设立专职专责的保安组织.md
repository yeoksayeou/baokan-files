West Hills Mines Experience Repeated Accidents

Beijing Western Hills Coal Mining Company Studies Prevention Methods, Decides to Establish Specialized Security Organization

[Our Newspaper] Since March of this year, accidents (mostly attributable accidents) have occurred frequently in the Western Hills mines of the Beijing Western Hills Coal Mining Company, causing serious losses to state property and workers' lives. The company convened a meeting of responsible cadres to examine the causes of the accidents and decided to establish a specialized security organization to prevent the continued occurrence of accidents. From March 22nd to May 29th, a total of 19 accidents of varying degrees occurred in the four mines of Chengzi, Menkou, Xishan, and Heishan in Beijing's Western Hills over a period of 69 days. Four people died, 23 were injured, and material losses were calculated as follows: three accidents at Chengzi Mine resulted in losses equivalent to 52,236 jin of millet; one accident at Xishan Mine resulted in losses equivalent to 30,000 jin of millet, and a reduction of 187 tons of coal production, as well as the burning of one 10K transformer, one electric water pump, and one set of fuse boards. On March 2nd, workers Liu Chenghe, Yang Baoxian, and others from Xishan Mine used iron bars to push medicine into the blasting hole, causing the gunpowder to explode, killing Liu and seriously injuring Yang. Similar accidents have occurred repeatedly in various mines in the past. Workers at Xishan Mine had suggested using wooden sticks to add medicine when blasting to prevent gunpowder explosions, and the company had also given this instruction; however, the administrative side of the mine failed to pay attention in time, resulting in this type of injury. On April 2nd, a water flooding incident occurred at Chengzi Mine. Before the incident, workers going down the shaft had noticed that the shaft was damp and said, "The shaft is about to flood again!" However, this did not attract the attention of the administrative side to take necessary preventive measures, resulting in an accident with a loss of over 43,000 jin of millet. On May 10th, Liu Erhai, a winch worker at Menkou Mine, left his post without authorization and privately found worker Zhang Zenglin to replace him without the permission of his superiors, resulting in an accident during the driving process, damaging one crown block, two small cages, and one brake column, equivalent to over 30,000 jin of millet.

In response to the continuous occurrence of serious accidents in various mines, the Beijing Western Hills Coal Mining Company convened a meeting of responsible persons from various administrative departments on June 3rd to study methods for preventing accidents. The meeting lasted for two days and identified that the main reason for the repeated occurrence of accidents was the lack of a specialized security organization and the failure to earnestly implement the inspection and responsibility system. Although the company accepted the workers' suggestion to establish a responsibility system after the yellow medicine explosion on July 8th last year, it was not strictly enforced, and inspections were not carried out, so the responsibility system remained merely a formality. The second reason for the occurrence of accidents was the failure to learn from the lessons of the accidents, conduct publicity and education among the majority of employees, and raise vigilance. Eighty-five percent of the causes of casualties in April accidents were due to negligence at work. Third, the leadership only focuses on completing production tasks and does not pay enough attention to safety work, which directly affects production. As General Manager Gao of the company said, "We have not paid enough attention to security work, and the idea that 'three-tenths of the disaster is underground, and coal mining is like fighting a war' has not been eradicated. We are paralyzed when nothing happens, and we are not surprised when something happens." In addition, lax management, relaxed discipline, failure to seriously investigate the responsibility for accidents, and failure to conduct mass education, only making passive and one-sided remedies, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, resulted in continuous accidents. After the water flooding incident occurred at Chengzi Mine, Zhao Shuanying, the mine's supervisory committee member, even said, "These things are unavoidable, and there are fewer now than in the past." At this meeting of responsible persons from various administrative departments of the Beijing Western Hills Coal Mining Company, in response to the above situation, it was decided to establish a full-time, dedicated security organization. Each mine will set up a security section to regularly arrange safety work and check the implementation, strengthen safety education, and improve employee vigilance to prevent the recurrence of accidents.

　　西山各矿迭出事故
    京西煤矿公司研究防止办法决设立专职专责的保安组织
    【本报讯】京西煤矿公司西山各矿自今年三月以来迭出事故（大部分为责任事故），国家财产及工人生命遭受严重损失；该公司召开负责干部会议，检查事故发生原因，决定设立专职专责的保安组织，以防止事故之继续发生。京西城子、门矿、西山、黑山四矿自三月二十二日至五月二十九日止，六十九天中，共发生大小事故达十九次。死亡四人，受伤二十三人，物资损失计：城子矿三次事故损失折小米五万二千二百三十六斤，西山矿一次事故损失折小米三万斤，并减少煤产一百八十七吨，烧毁１０Ｋ变压器一个、电水泵及保险板各一个。三月二日西山矿工人刘成和、杨宝贤等以铁棍向炮眼内挤药，火药爆炸，刘炸死，杨受重伤。类此事故，各矿过去曾不断发生。西山矿工人曾建议装炮时用木棍添药，以防止火药爆炸，公司亦曾有此指示；但该矿行政方面竟未能及时注意。以致发生此类伤人事件。四月二日城子矿发生了水淹窑事件。在事件发生前，下窑工人曾发现窑中潮湿，并说：“窑里又快冒水啦！”但未能引起行政方面的注意。进行必要的防范措置，以致事故发生损失小米达四万三千余斤。五月十日门矿煤井开绞车工人刘二海擅自歇班，未经上级许可私自找工人张增林替班，结果在开车途中发生事故，损失天轮一个、小罐笼两个、闸柱一根，折合小米三万余斤。
    京西煤矿公司因各矿连续发生严重事故，乃于六月三日召开行政各部门负责人会议研究防止事故办法。会议历时二日，检查出屡次发生事故的主要原因，就是没有专门的保安组织，对检查与责任制度未认真执行。早在去年七月八日发生黄药爆炸后，公司方面虽然接受了工人提议，建立责任制度，但因执行不严格，并未进行检查，以致责任制度仍然只是一个形式。发生事故的第二个原因，是未能很好接受事故教训，向广大职工进行宣传教育，提高警惕。四月份事故伤亡原因，百分之八十五是由于工作时的疏忽所致。第三、是由于领导上只追求完成生产任务，对直接影响生产的安全工作重视不够。正如该公司高经理所说：“对保安工作没有重视，‘井下三分灾、采煤如打仗’的思想仍然没有肃清。没出事时麻痹，出了事也不觉得惊奇。”再加上管理不严、纪律松懈、不认真追究事故责任，亦不作群众性的教育，只作消极的、片面的弥补，头痛治头，脚痛治脚，因而事故连续不断发生。城子矿发生水淹窑的事件后，该矿监委赵拴英还说：“这些事情免不了，现在比过去少多了。”这次京西煤矿公司的行政各部门负责人会议上，针对以上情况，决定设立专职、专责的保安组织，各矿设保安股，经常负责布置安全工作，并检查执行情况，加强安全教育，提高职工警惕，以防止事故之再发生。
