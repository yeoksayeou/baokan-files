　　Jiaoda Beijing Management Institute and Agricultural University Teachers and Students
    Issue Protests and Declarations, Angrily Condemning American Aggression
    [This newspaper's report] Teachers and students of Jiaoda Beijing Management Institute and Agricultural University are angrily protesting against American aggression.
    In the protest letter from the Jiaoda Beijing Institute's Trade Union and Student Union against American imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, it stated: All teachers, staff, and students of Jiaoda Beijing Institute resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, support Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement, and are determined to take practical action, first by doing a good job in the on-site railway internship during the summer vacation, and strengthening the struggle against American imperialism.
    Since American imperialism instigated the United Nations to pass a resolution on its armed interference in the internal affairs of Korea, and Truman issued a statement on armed obstruction of our liberation of Taiwan, all teachers and students of the Agricultural University have been filled with indignation. After Premier Zhou's statement on July 6, the school's trade union, student union, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch issued a declaration stating: "The solemn statement issued by our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations Security Council on July 6 fully represents the will and demands of the Chinese people. We resolutely support it and vow to support the liberation of Taiwan with action."
