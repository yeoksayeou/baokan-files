    Actively Promote Mass Education Work
    Holding Lectures, Screening Movies, and Lending Books
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Under the unified leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Beijing People's Cultural Center, Reading Rooms, and Municipal Library have been actively carrying out mass education work, achieving new developments in the past six months.

    Beijing currently has nine cultural centers, thirteen reading rooms, and two municipal libraries (including one branch library, divided into an adult section and a children's section). It is planned to add three more cultural centers and twenty-eight reading rooms this year. The work of each center and room is carried out on the basis of close integration with the needs of the masses. First, they have established spare-time literacy schools and children's literacy classes for workers and citizens, with approximately 2,000 students currently enrolled (excluding graduates). Second, they are carrying out cultural activities. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of the year, the total number of visitors to the centers and rooms was 514,537, and they held 78 public lectures, 91 recreational evenings, 14 photo and other exhibitions, and the film teams performed 105 times, with an audience of 207,100 people. The library held 36 "Children's Speaking Sessions" with 1,370 children attending. Recently, a "Youth Summer School Entrance Counseling Center" was established, purchasing books on college entrance guidance, and surveying the general conditions and enrollment information of secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as colleges and universities in Beijing, Tianjin, the Northeast and other regions, for the reference of primary and secondary school graduates. In order to facilitate reading for the working people, each center and room has reading stations and mobile stations in factories and streets, organizing reading groups, allowing group leaders to lend books to group members for circulation. The Cultural Center has also established a question-answering and writing service.
