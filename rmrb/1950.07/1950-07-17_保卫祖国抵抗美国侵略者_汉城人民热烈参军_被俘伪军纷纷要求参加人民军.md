　　Defend the Motherland and Resist American Aggressors
    Seoul People Enthusiastically Join the Army
    Captured Puppet Soldiers Request to Join the People's Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] TASS, 15th, cited a broadcast from Pyongyang Radio as saying: The broad masses of people in Seoul enthusiastically expressed their willingness to join the People's Army to defend the motherland and resist the American aggressors. From July 3rd to 10th, 778 mass rallies were held in Seoul, and many people attending the meetings expressed their willingness to go to the front lines. To date, 80,000 people in the city have filled out applications to join the army.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th] According to the Korean Central News Agency, Seoul: "National Defense Army" puppet soldiers captured during the People's Army's rapid advance are receiving preferential treatment and education in various reception centers. They have gradually awakened to their past crimes, which has aroused their hatred for the Syngman Rhee bandit gang and a desire to join the People's Army.
    On the 9th, more than 1,500 prisoners held at the Susong National School in Seoul voluntarily convened a rally to rise up. At the meeting, captured soldier Kim Dong-shin said: In the past, we were deceived by the Syngman Rhee bandits and committed numerous evils against the motherland and the people. According to our crimes against the people, we deserve to die, but the People's Army has treated us with preferential treatment, which has deeply moved me and made me understand that the past false propaganda of the "National Defense Army" officers against the People's Army was completely slander. Many captured soldiers reviewed their past sins in their speeches and unanimously expressed their willingness to go to the front lines to completely eliminate the enemy and redeem themselves with meritorious service. The conference finally adopted a telegram calling on the remaining puppet soldiers to surrender as soon as possible.

　　保卫祖国抵抗美国侵略者
    汉城人民热烈参军
    被俘伪军纷纷要求参加人民军
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社十五日电引平壤电台广播称：汉城广大人民热烈地表示自愿参加人民军，以保卫祖国抵抗美国侵略者。自七月三日至十日，汉城曾举行了七百七十八次群众大会，到会的许多群众都表示愿意上前线去。迄今，该城已有八万人民填具了入伍申请书。
    【新华社平壤十六日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社汉城讯：在人民军神速的进军中被俘虏的伪“国防军”，在各地收容所受到人民军的优待和教育后，已逐渐醒悟他们过去的罪行，从而激起了他们对李承晚匪帮的憎恨，并要求参加人民军。
    九日，收容在汉城寿松国民学校的俘虏一千五百余人自动召开奋起大会。会上，俘虏兵金东新说：过去我们受了李承晚匪徒的欺骗，在祖国与人民面前作恶多端。如按我们对人民的罪恶来说，是死有余辜的，但人民军却优待我们，使我深受感动，并了解了过去“国防军”军官对人民军的虚妄宣传完全是诬赖。许多俘虏兵在发言中都检讨了自己过去的罪过，一致表示要上前线，彻底消灭敌人，立功赎罪。大会最后通过了号召残余伪军早日投降的通电。
