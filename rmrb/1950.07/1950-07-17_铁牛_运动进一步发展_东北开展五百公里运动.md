　　“Iron Ox” Movement Further Develops
	Northeast Launches 500-Kilometer Movement
	[Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways has decided to launch a "500-Kilometer" competition movement in July within the jurisdiction of the Qiqihar, Jilin, and Jinzhou Railway Administrations, requiring locomotives to travel an average of 500 kilometers per day. This movement is a further development of the "Iron Ox" movement in Northeast China and will rapidly increase the efficiency of people's railway transportation further on the existing basis. Currently, the average travel speed of locomotives on Northeast railways is 23-24 kilometers per hour. After deducting the 30-40% for stopovers and preparation time, the actual average daily operation is only 370-400 kilometers. The "500-Kilometer" movement mainly aims to strengthen the close connection between the train operation and mechanical engineering transportation personnel, combine the actions of transportation commanders and the broad masses of field workers, strengthen planning and organization, and reasonably shorten excessively long technical operation times and station stop times, thereby achieving the goal of improving transportation efficiency. The "500-Kilometer" movement is one of the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Railways launched this movement a year ago, it greatly strengthened freight car turnover rates, increased the daily mileage of locomotives, and thereby reduced railway transportation costs.

　　“铁牛”运动进一步发展
    东北开展五百公里运动
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】铁道部驻东北特派员办事处，决定七月份在齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州三个铁路管理局管区内，开展“五百公里”竞赛运动，要求机车每日平均行驶五百公里。这一运动，是东北“铁牛”运动的进一步的发展，将使人民铁路运输效率在现有基础上迅速再提高一步。目前东北铁路的机车每小时旅行速度为二十三、四公里，除停留和整备时间占百分之三十至四十外，实际上每日平均仅运行三百七十至四百公里。开展“五百公里”运动，主要是用加强车务、机务运输人员的密切联系，使运输指挥人员和广大的现场工作人员的行动结合起来，加强计划性和组织性，合理地缩短各种过长的技术作业时间和站停时间等办法，以达到提高运输效率的目的。按“五百公里”运动，是苏联的先进经验之一。苏联铁路在一年前开展了这一运动后，即大大加强了货车的周转率，提高了机车的日行里程，从而减低了铁路的运输成本。
