　　Distribution of Soviet Books and Periodicals in China
    Introducing "International Bookstore"
    The general store of the International Bookstore was established in Beijing on December 1, 1949. It bears the task of facilitating cultural exchange between China and foreign countries, spreading a large number of foreign books and periodicals—especially Soviet books and periodicals—that are helpful to the construction of New China to the broad masses of readers.
    After the establishment of the International Bookstore, among the large number of books and periodicals ordered from the Soviet Union and shipped to China, there are seven languages ​​including Chinese, Russian, English, German, French, Japanese, and Korean. Among them are Marxist-Leninist classics, social sciences, natural sciences, literature and art, industrial technology, children's books, dictionaries, and maps; nearly 200 kinds of foreign language (mostly Russian) periodicals such as "New Times", "Bolshevik", "Soviet Woman" (with Chinese version), "Bulletin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences", "Agriculture", "Mines", and "Soviet Literature"; 16 kinds of pictorials such as "Krokodil", "Spark", and "Soviet Construction" (now renamed "Soviet Pictorial", with Chinese version); 21 kinds of daily and weekly newspapers such as "Pravda" (Russian), "Izvestia" (Russian), "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" (Russian, English); as well as beautifully printed pictures of revolutionary teachers such as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and records. In addition, newspapers and periodicals such as "Akahata" (Japanese) and "Zenei" (Japanese) are ordered directly from Japan and shipped here. Up to the end of May this year, the store's purchases from the Soviet International Book Company, for books alone, have reached 3,217,893 copies. All kinds of books, periodicals, and pictures have been distributed to all parts of the country and are warmly welcomed by the vast number of readers. In particular, the Chinese version of books published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House are more popular among readers, who compete to buy them. At present, 529 domestic counterparts have established business relations with the International Bookstore.
    In order to strengthen international ties and further promote cultural exchange between China and foreign countries, the International Bookstore has recently established preliminary business relations with Collet's Bookstore in London. In the future, it will also establish distribution relations with progressive bookstores in Europe and the United States, and widely purchase progressive books and periodicals from all over the world. It has now begun to handle subscriptions for progressive books and periodicals from various countries, serving readers. However, at present, its main task is still to distribute Soviet books and periodicals.
    Under the enthusiastic demand of the broad masses of readers for Soviet books and periodicals, the business of the International Bookstore has developed rapidly. In order to meet the needs of readers across the country and better promote the distribution of international books and periodicals throughout China, the store has successively established branches in Shanghai, Hankou, Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian in mid-April and early May this year. The Beijing branch officially opened on "July 1st". It is also planned to establish branches in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing in July, August, and September this year. The established branches in various places are not only welcomed by local Chinese readers, but also by foreign nationals, especially readers from the great Soviet Union. On the opening day of the Beijing branch, more than 5,000 people visited and purchased books, including many foreign nationals and foreign professors. The books and periodicals sold the most were revolutionary theory books in Chinese and English such as Selected Works of Lenin, Soviet Thirty-Year Calendar, Soviet children's books, various pictures, revolutionary great men's portraits, and various natural science books related to heavy industry. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 15 million yuan worth of books and periodicals were sold in one day. The Shanghai branch sold 5,758 books and 7,169 newspapers, periodicals, and pictures in the three days of its opening, with an average of nearly 3,000 readers per day, including a considerable number of Soviet readers. The Hankou branch sold 4,209 books and periodicals in the three days of its opening. The Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian branches also had the same grand occasion.
    The range of readers' needs for Soviet books and periodicals is very wide. Although the International Bookstore has more than 2,400 kinds of Chinese and foreign books (Russian accounts for the largest majority), it still cannot meet the needs of readers. Many books and periodicals are in short supply, such as Kalinin's "On Communist Education" (Chinese version), some foreign language technical books, various pictorials, pictures, etc., which were quickly snapped up. For example, in Beijing alone, Xinhua, Sanlian, and Lianying bookstores sold 17,031 copies of "Stalin's Biography" in the one-week bargain sale to commemorate Stalin's seventieth birthday.
    At present, the staff of the store in various places, in order to strive to better serve readers, have set off a upsurge in learning Russian, and learning Russian has become the main content of the store's business study. Branches have been successively established in the main cities of major administrative regions. The past method of layered distribution has now been changed to vertical distribution, directly establishing business relations with local public and private bookstores. Business relations between the trades are gradually improving. The store also hopes that readers and colleagues will provide them with more suggestions to do a good job in the distribution of Soviet books and periodicals in China.

　　苏联书刊在中国的发行
    介绍“国际书店”
    国际书店总店，于一九四九年十二月一日在北京成立，它肩负着沟通中外文化交流的任务，把大量有助于新中国建设的外国书刊——尤其是苏联书刊，传播到广大读者群众中间去。
    国际书店成立后，向苏联订购并已运来中国的大量书刊中，有中、俄、英、德、法、日、朝鲜七种文字。其中有马列主义经典著作、社学科学、自然科学、文艺、工业技术、儿童读物、字典和地图等等；有《新时代》、《布尔塞维克》、《苏联妇女》（有中文版）、《苏联科学院院报》、《农业》、《矿山》、《苏联文学》等近二百种的外文（大多数是俄文）期刊；《火星》、《鳄鱼》、《苏联建设》（现改为《苏联》画报，有中文版）等十六种画报；有《真理报》（俄文）、《消息报》（俄文）、《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》（俄、英文）等二十一种日报周报；还有印刷精美的马、恩、列、斯等革命导师的各种画片，以及唱片等。另有《赤旗报》（日文）及《前卫》（日文）等报刊，系直接向日本订购运来。迄今年五月底，该店向苏联国际图书公司的进货，仅书籍一项，已达三百二十一万七千八百九十三册。各种书刊画片发行到全国各地，都受到广大读者的热烈欢迎。尤其是莫斯科外国文书籍出版局印行的中文版书籍，更为读者所喜爱，争相竞购。现在国内已有五二九家同业，和国际书店建立了业务往来关系。
    国际书店为了加强与国际间的联系，进一步促进中外文化交流，近已与伦敦考列茨书店初步建立了业务往来关系，今后并将与欧美各国进步书店亦建立经销关系，广泛采购全世界进步书刊。现已开始代办代订各国进步书刊，为读者服务。但在目前，仍以发行苏联书刊为主要任务。
    在广大读者对苏联书刊的热烈需求下，国际书店的业务获得迅速的发展。为了适应全国读者的要求，以更好地推广国际书刊在全中国的发行，该店于今年四月中及五月初，已先后在上海、汉口、沈阳、哈尔滨、大连等地建立了分店。北京分店已于“七一”正式开幕。并计划争取于今年七、八、九三个月内，在天津、广州、西安、重庆四地建立分店。已设立的各地分店，不仅受到当地中国读者的欢迎，也受到外侨特别是来自伟大的苏联友邦的读者的欢迎。北京分店开幕的当天，前往参观及购书者约在五千人以上，其中有不少外侨及外籍教授。卖出去的书刊，以中英版的革命理论书如列宁选集、苏联三十年日历、苏联儿童读物、各种图片、革命伟人像、有关重工业的各种自然科学书籍等为最多。据不完全的统计，一天中共售出一千五百万元的书刊。上海分店在开幕三天中，就售出书籍五、七五八册，报刊、画片等七、一六九份，平均每天读者近三千人，其中也有为数颇多的苏联读者。汉口分店在开幕三天中售出书刊四、二○九册。沈阳、哈尔滨、大连各分店，亦都有同样的盛况。
    读者对苏联书刊的需要范围是非常广泛的。虽然国际书店已备有二千四百余种（俄文占最大多数）中外文书籍，但仍不能满足读者的需求。很多书刊都感到供不应求，如加里宁著《论共产主义教育》（中文版）、部分外文技术书、各种画报、画片等很快就被抢购一空。如《斯大林传略》一书仅在北京一地，新华、三联、联营三家书店，在纪念斯大林七十寿辰廉价一周中，就售出一万七千零三十一册。
    目前该店各地工作人员，为了争取更好地为读者服务，都掀起了学习俄文的热潮，学习俄文成了该店业务学习的主要内容。在各大行政区的主要城市，分店已陆续建立，过去分层发行的方式，现已改变为垂直发行，直接和各地公私营书店建立业务往来关系。同业间的业务关系，已在逐渐改善中。该店并希望读者及同业多给他们提供意见，做好苏联书刊在中国的发行工作。（出版总署新闻秘书）
