　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to coordinate with the work of adjusting industry and commerce in Beijing, and to more effectively assist private enterprises in solving the difficulties of capital turnover, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has expanded the scope and amount of loans. In June, a total of 9.64 billion yuan was loaned, which is 17% more than the 8.2 billion yuan loaned in April and May combined. In the past, the bank's loan targets were mainly industry, but now commerce has also been listed as an important target for loans. The scope of industrial loans is: all factories that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, have development prospects, and have a production foundation can be loaned; some industries that are temporarily overproducing but are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, if they can improve quality, reduce costs, and open up sales channels, can also be appropriately loaned. The scope of commercial loans is limited to industries that promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas or sell people's daily necessities, such as transfer warehouses, hardware and equipment, bristles and fur, stationery, construction and other industries' transporters and retailers, cotton cloth, coal, oil and salt, department stores, porcelain, sacks, transportation equipment, and medicine and medical treatment industries' transporters, etc. The loan amount was previously stipulated not to exceed 50% of the borrower's current assets, but now it has been expanded to a limit of not more than one-half of the borrower's net assets, but discount loans are not subject to this limit. The loan period is determined according to the industrial production process and commercial turnover needs. Industrial loans are generally for three months, with a maximum of no more than six months; commercial loans are for a maximum of no more than three months. The loan methods are divided into three types: lump-sum loans and lump-sum repayment, lump-sum loans and zero repayment, and installment loans and lump-sum repayment. In principle, collateral is required.
　　According to the above policy, in June, the bank loaned a total of 3.2 billion yuan to 195 industrial households; 690 million yuan to 47 commercial households; and 1.9 billion yuan to other businesses. Through the Bank of China, 3.7 billion yuan was loaned to 113 exporters; and 200 million yuan to 77 special handicraftsmen. After obtaining loans, most of the manufacturers overcame the difficulties of funds, and their businesses were able to maintain. Some, through the active management of the owners, have moved towards normal development.

　　积极协助私营企业解决资金困难
    市人民银行扩大贷款范围  六月份共贷出九十六亿元
    【京市新闻处讯】人民银行北京分行为结合京市调整工商业的工作，更有力地协助私营企业解决资金周转的困难，特扩大贷款范围和额度。六月份共贷出九十六亿四千余万元，比四、五两月一共贷出的八十二亿余元还多百分之十七。过去该行贷款对象主要是工业，现在商业也列为贷款的重要对象。工业贷款范围是：凡有利于国计民生，有发展前途，生产有基础的工厂都可贷款，某些有利于国计民生而暂时生产过剩的行业，如能提高质量，降低成本，打开销路，也可适当贷款。商业贷款范围，限于促进内外城乡物资交流或经售人民生活必需品的行业，如转运货栈、五金器材、鬃毛皮货、文具用品、建筑等业的运销商与坐商，棉布、煤炭、油盐、百货、磁器、麻袋、交通用具和医药诊疗等业的运销商等。贷款额度过去规定不能超过借户流动资金的百分之五十，现在扩大为以不超过借户资产净值的二分之一为限，但押汇贷款不在此限。贷款期限根据工业生产过程和商业周转需要来决定，工业一般为三个月，最长不超过六个月；商业最长不超过三个月。贷款方式分整贷整还、整贷零还及分贷整还三种，原则上均须有抵押品。
    该行根据上述方针，六月份里计贷给工业一百九十五户，共三十二亿余元；商业四十七户，共六亿九千余万元；其他事业十九亿余元。通过中国银行贷给出口商一百一十三户，共三十七亿余元；特种手工艺七十七户，共二亿余元。各厂商获得贷款后，大部克服了资金的困难，业务都能维持下来，有些经业主的积极经营，已走向正常发展。
