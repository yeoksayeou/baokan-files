Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th. Wen Xuefeng, former advisor to the US Military Government Intelligence Office (C.I.C.) and later political advisor to Syngman Rhee, who was captured by the Korean People's Army, revealed the truth about the US imperialists and their stooge Syngman Rhee's conspiracy and launching of the Korean civil war in a broadcast on Pyongyang Radio on the 21st. Wen Xuefeng said: The United States had determined the policy of forcibly sacrificing Korea since last winter. To facilitate specific command of the war, the United States handed over the ruling power of Korea to MacArthur at the beginning of this year. MacArthur's plan was to provoke a Korean civil war before July this year. Because they believed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army would attack Taiwan in July, and the United States wanted to provoke a Korean civil war before attacking Taiwan in order to resolve Korea and invade Taiwan.

　　In February this year, MacArthur summoned Syngman Rhee to Tokyo and personally instructed him on ten military secrets: 1. Syngman Rhee's army should be placed under MacArthur's command; 2. Syngman Rhee's army should fight together with the Japanese army; 3. When fighting together with the Japanese army, former "Old King" Yi Eun, who served as the commander of the Japanese Air Force during the Japanese imperial era, should be appointed as the commander-in-chief under the operational command of MacArthur's headquarters; 4. Syngman Rhee should provide the Japanese army with 1 million shil of white rice as food, to be delivered to MacArthur's headquarters by the end of June; 5. Syngman Rhee's army should be responsible for launching the civil war; 6. Syngman Rhee should, under Japanese supervision, set up military factories in Japan. Senior officers of Syngman Rhee's army should be sent to Japan for military training immediately; 7. Syngman Rhee's army should hire Japanese officers; 8. It is impossible for Syngman Rhee to mobilize more people into the army, and moreover, untrained recruits cannot fight, so Japanese soldiers should be used to supplement their numbers; 9. MacArthur is responsible for guaranteeing Syngman Rhee's position, whether before or after the war; 10. MacArthur is responsible for supplying the Japanese army with weapons and ammunition for six months of use in the Korean War.

　　Syngman Rhee immediately accepted MacArthur's instructions. After returning to his country, he immediately sent senior officers such as Chae Byeong-deok to Japan, and ordered Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo to transport a large amount of rice to Japan, busying himself with provoking the civil war.

　　On the other hand, the Syngman Rhee puppet government's corruption and incompetence, internal disintegration, and economic decline brought the political crisis to a climax in the spring of this year. This is also the reason why the Syngman Rhee government actively launched the "Northern Expedition." It hoped to overcome the crisis through the adventure of civil war. Since June 12, the heads of the Syngman Rhee government, Chae Byeong-deok, Shin Sung-mo, Kim Seok-won, and others, had been discussing and studying how to launch a civil war all day long. They made specific arrangements, namely, Kim Seok-won commanded the western front, and Chae Byeong-deok commanded the eastern front. After all preparations were completed, they finally decided to start the "Northern Expedition" on June 24.

　　Wen Xuefeng exposed the crimes committed by the Syngman Rhee clique against the Korean people under the direction of their American masters, and he himself had actively participated in those criminal activities in the past. He repented and said: I deeply regret my past heinous crimes against the motherland and the people. I am determined to correct my past mistakes.

    揭露美李发动朝鲜内战真相     
    麦克阿瑟曾面授李承晚挑起内战的军事机密十项
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】被朝鲜人民军俘掳的前美军政厅情报处（Ｃ·Ｉ·Ｃ）顾问，后任李承晚政治顾问的文学凤，于二十一日在平壤电台广播，揭露美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚预谋并发动朝鲜内战的真相。文学凤说：美国自去年冬起即确定了强行牺牲朝鲜的政策。为便于具体指挥战争，美国今年初将朝鲜的统治权交给了麦克阿瑟。麦克阿瑟的计划确定要在今年七月以前挑起朝鲜内战。因为他们认为中国人民解放军将于七月进攻台湾，而美国则要在进攻台湾以前挑起朝鲜内战，以便解决朝鲜，侵占台湾。
    今年二月，麦克阿瑟将李承晚叫到东京，面授军事机密十项：一、李承晚军队应一律置于麦克阿瑟的指挥之下；二、李承晚军队应与日本军队共同作战；三、与日军共同作战时，应任命前日帝时代曾任日本空军司令官的“旧王”李垠为麦克阿瑟司令部作战指挥部下的总司令官；四、李承晚应供给日本军队食粮白米一百万石，限六月底送到麦克阿瑟司令部；五、李承晚军队应负发动内战的任务；六、李承晚应在日本人的监视下，将军需工厂设于日本。李承晚军队的高级军官应即时派往日本受军事训练；七、李承晚军队应雇用日本军官；八、李承晚要动员更多的人当兵是不可能的，况且没有受过训练的新兵也不能打仗，因而应以日本兵补充其数量；九、麦克阿瑟不论战前战后，负责保证李承晚的地位；十、麦克阿瑟负责供给准备用于朝鲜战争中的日本军队及其能使用六个月的武器弹药。
    李承晚当即接受了麦克阿瑟的各项指示，返国后立即将蔡秉德等高级军官派赴日本，又命令“国防部”长官申性模将大批大米运往日本，为挑拨内战而奔忙。
    另一方面，李承晚傀儡政府的腐败无能，内部分崩离析，民生凋敝，使今年春天的政治危机达于极点。这也是李承晚政府积极发动“北伐”的原因。它希望在内战的冒险中来克服危机。自六月十二日以后，李承晚政府的首脑们蔡秉德、申性模、金锡源等人即整天讨论，研究如何发动内战的问题。他们作了具体的布置，即由金锡源指挥西部战线，蔡秉德指挥东部战线。一切准备停当之后，遂于六月二十四日最后决定开始“北伐”。
    文学凤揭露了李承晚集团在其美国主子指使下对朝鲜人民所犯的罪恶，而他自己过去也是积极参加那些罪恶活动的。他悔罪说：我深悔我过去对祖国与人民的滔天罪恶，我决心改正过去的错误。
