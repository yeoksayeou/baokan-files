　　"Taiwan Must Be Liberated, It Is Chinese Territory"
    Liu Chaoge, Farmer Representative from Beijing's People's Representative Conference
    Liu Chaoge, a farmer representative to the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference, expressed great anger at the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. He said, "What is the American imperialist doing coming to the Chinese people's country, the Chinese people's home? This is an act of aggression." He also said, "The Chinese people can no longer suffer the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek. I haven't had a single good day in decades. We finally got liberated, and we can't tolerate Chiang bandit's anger anymore." He continued, "Taiwan must be liberated, it is Chinese territory, like tidying up the house, it must be sorted out. We have a good reason, and with Chairman Mao leading us, we will definitely win. We farmers in the suburbs are determined to produce well, support the front lines, and liberate Taiwan."
    Liu Chaoge is very concerned about the Korean people. Regarding the American imperialist aggression, he said angrily, "What business does the American imperialist have interfering in other people's affairs? Isn't it just trying to turn Korea into its own, not allowing Korean farmers to stand up? Farmers all over the world are one family, we should support the Korean People's Army to drive out the American imperialists!"

　　“台湾一定得解放那是中国的地方”
    京各界代表会农民代表刘朝阁
    北京第二次各界人民代表会议农民代表刘朝阁，对于美帝侵略台湾和朝鲜，表示非常愤怒。他说：“中国人的国、中国人的家，他美帝来干什么？这是侵略行为。”他又说：“中国人民不能再受蒋介石的压迫了，像我这几十年就没有过一天好日子，好容易解放了，再也不能受蒋匪的气了。”他接着说：“台湾一定得解放，那是中国的地方，和整理家务一样，非弄清楚不可。我们的理正，又有毛主席领导，一定能打得胜。我们郊区的农民决心好好生产，支援前线，解放台湾。”
    刘朝阁很关心朝鲜人民。对美帝的侵略，他愤愤地说：“人家自己的事，美帝来管什么？还不是想把朝鲜变成他的，不让朝鲜农民翻身。天下农民是一家，我们应当声援朝鲜人民军把美帝打出去！”
