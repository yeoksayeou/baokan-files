Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 28th: Units of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have seized the gaps in combat, training, garrisoning cities, and production to carry out cultural learning to varying degrees. In the past six months, they have achieved preliminary results, laying a certain foundation for carrying out large-scale cultural education throughout the army in the future.

　　Raising the cultural level of the troops is one of the important tasks of the East China troops this year. The Field Army and the Military Region Armed Forces have implemented this task according to their different conditions. In stable environments such as organs and schools, cultural refresher schools and classes have been generally established. Most cadres and soldiers below the elementary school level have undergone relatively formal on-the-job learning. For example, the East China Military and Political University has established seventeen cultural refresher schools, with more than 4,000 cadres and soldiers enrolled, of which cadres account for 40 percent. Many regiment and battalion-level cadres with more than ten years of struggle history have participated in the study. In the Shanghai Garrison, the percentage of soldiers who knew 200 to 1,200 characters increased from 28 percent to 56.8 percent in half a year, and 50 percent of the soldiers went from not knowing Arabic numerals to learning the four arithmetic operations with integers.

　　In the troops preparing for war and training, cultural learning is combined with military learning. In two and a half months of intensive training, a certain artillery regiment learned an average of 191 characters per person. Frontline troops had no textbooks and no formal cultural learning classes, so cultural instructors taught based on the war preparation projects. For example, when practicing enemy landing, they would write "Breakthrough the Front" to teach everyone to learn. Ships and beaches were all classrooms. In some artillery units, the names of artillery parts were written on pieces of paper and pasted onto the parts, learning to remember the names of the parts while learning characters.

　　Most of the soldiers were adults, and it was very difficult to start learning. But everyone overcame these difficulties with redoubled efforts. In addition to formal study time, they also used every gap in time for self-study and mutual assistance. Many soldiers resolutely quit smoking and saved their allowances and disability funds to buy pens and popular reading materials. They also created many ways to help with learning, established various learning systems, and formed mutual aid groups.

　　The troops' accompanying bookstores—libraries—and literary and art troupes went deep into the companies to carry out their work. Newspapers at all levels of the troops are concerned about cultivating soldier correspondents. Many companies and battalions have set up newspapers for soldiers to practice writing and reading.

　　These cultural activities in the troops have powerfully promoted cultural learning. Before cultural learning, all units underwent a series of education on the situation and tasks. Some troops also conducted "cultural bitterness" sessions to dig into the roots of their low cultural levels. Everyone deeply recognized the great victory of the revolution and their own bright future. Therefore, they were eager to improve their cultural level in order to better master modern military technology and participate in national construction.

　　华东军区暨第三野战军各部
    文化学习有显著成绩
    为今后大规模的文化教育工作打下基础
    【新华社南京二十八日电】人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军各部抓紧战斗、练兵、警备城市和生产的空隙时间，分别进行了不同程度的文化学习，半年来已有了初步成绩，为今后开展全军大规模的文化教育工作打下了一定的基础。
    提高部队文化水平是今年华东部队的重要任务之一。野战军和军区武装都根据各自不同的条件贯彻执行这一任务。环境安定的机关和学校中已普遍举办了文化补习学校和文化补习班，初小程度以下的干部和战士大多进行了较为正规的在职学习。如华东军政大学，已办了十七个文化补习学校，有四千多个干部和战士入学，其中干部占百分之四十。许多有十年以上斗争历史的营、团级干部，参加了学习。上海警备部队半年中识二百字至一千二百字者由百分之二十八增至百分之五十六点八，百分之五十的战士由不识阿拉伯数字到学会了算整数四则。
    在备战与练兵部队中，文化学习是与军事学习结合进行的。某炮兵团在两个半月的紧张练兵中，平均每人学会了一百九十一个字。前方部队没有课本，没有正式的文化学习课，文化教员就根据备战项目教书。如演习敌前登陆，就写“突破前沿”几个字教大家学。船上、海边都是课堂。炮兵部队中有的连队把大炮零件名称写在纸片上贴到零件上去，一面学记零件名称，一面学字。
    战士们大部分是成年人，开始学习时十分吃力。但大家以加倍的努力克服了这些困难。他们除了正式的学习时间外，还利用了每个空隙时间进行自学和互助。许多战士坚决戒了烟，把津贴费、残废金存起来买钢笔和通俗读物。他们还创造了许多帮助学习的办法，订立了各种学习制度，成立了互助小组。
    各部的随军书店——图书馆和文艺工作团深入连队展开工作。各级部队报纸都关心培养战士通讯员。很多连、营办了供战士练习写作和阅读的报纸。
    部队中这些文化活动有力地推动了文化学习。各部在文化学习之前都经过一系列的形势与任务的教育，有的部队还进行了“文化诉苦”，挖掘自己文化水平低的根源。大家都深切地认识了革命的伟大胜利和自己的光辉前途，因此都急切地要求提高自己的文化程度，以便更好地掌握现代化的军事技术和参加国家建设。
