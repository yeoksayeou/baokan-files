Good Village Chief Guo Wanxing

　　If anyone goes to Maojiatuo in the Third District of Fengrun, Hebei, to inquire about the conduct of the village chief, no one will fail to praise Village Chief Guo Wanxing. Guo Wanxing comes from a poor peasant background and is thirty-nine years old this year. He is straightforward, fair in his dealings, and an excellent Communist Party member. He worked as a laborer in Shenyang, Tangshan, and other places from the age of nineteen, suffering feudal oppression and exploitation from foremen, and only returned home at the age of twenty-six. When he was a war support committee member in the village, it was during the time when the corrupt element Zhang Weiye was in power as the chairman of the farmers' association. Last August, the district dismissed Zhang Weiye from his post and expelled him from the Party. The masses then elected Guo Wanxing as village chief through public election.

　　When the autumn grain requisition began last November, in order to reverse the past phenomenon where cadres delayed or failed to pay, thus affecting the masses who deliberately delayed in handing over public grain, he personally handed over his share first and called on all village cadres to hand over theirs as well. Then he launched a propaganda campaign among the masses, enabling the entire village to complete the grain requisition work within two days.

　　Last autumn, during heavy rains, his village and Baigezhuang frequently argued due to blocking and digging up waterways. This not only affected the unity of the people in both villages, but also resulted in water accumulation in the fields due to the chaotic blocking and digging of waterways. The crops were on the verge of being flooded. He and Secretary Zhang Junping led the masses to dig a drainage ditch through Zhang Guozheng's millet field (with Zhang Guozheng's prior consent, and the losses incurred by digging the ditch would be compensated to him by the beneficiaries). From then on, the accumulated water was drained, and three thousand mu of crops were saved from flooding. The masses in both villages reflected, saying, "Guo Wanxing is truly a good village chief, always doing things that benefit everyone!"

　　In order to overcome shifting sands and complete the task of turning dry land into paddy fields in the future, he was determined to mobilize the masses to dig ten or so wells. This spring, they have already completed two stone wells. In the well-digging work, he also researched a new well-digging method, which is to use fifteen wooden planks, four feet long, three feet wide, and one inch thick (the deeper the well, the more planks are needed), to arrange them into wooden rings and put them down section by section to replace the commonly used reed rings in the past. This not only better blocks the shifting sands, but also the wooden planks can be used for a long time, saving more money than using reeds.

　　In order to strengthen unity, he appropriately used criticism and self-criticism. In the Party group meetings, he often reviewed his own shortcomings in work to inspire others and carry out criticism. Last year, he and Secretary Zhang Junping argued because he disagreed with sending comfort meat to the militia during the New Year's holiday. The secretary and the militiamen were all angry with him, saying in unison, "Let's split up!" He was afraid that if he continued to speak at that time, it would break the feelings of both parties and affect future work, so he walked away silently. Two days later, he raised the reason why comfort meat should not be given to the militia at the branch meeting with a serious attitude and made a criticism. Finally, the secretary understood the idea and said, "I was wrong that day." Since then, the unity between the two of them has become even closer.

　　During the assessment of production last winter, it was the cold winter weather that froze hands and feet. He led six appraisal committee members and walked step by step through two thousand three hundred and twelve plots of land (eighty-six hectares and sixty-seven mu) in seven days. Zhang Xiuyun, a female appraisal committee member, even wore out her shoes, but still insisted on appraising the grades plot by plot in the fields. Because of the difference of one catty and two taels of maize in the allocation of grain, he and the appraisal committee members and the accountant stayed up all night to find out the difference. During the first month of the lunar calendar, when the whole village issued land certificates, he was so busy that he only ate one meal a day.

　　Because of his remarkable work performance, he was elected as a representative of the county's people's congress, the village's farmers' congress, and the county and district Party congresses.

　　Currently, under his united leadership, the cadres and farmers of the village generally cultivate the fields five or six times and the cotton four times. More than two hundred of the village's five hundred households have prepared enough topdressing fertilizer.

　　好村长郭万兴
    只要有人到河北丰润三区毛家坨打听一下该村村长的作风，没有一个人不称赞郭万兴村长的。郭万兴是贫农出身，今年三十九岁。他性情耿直，办事公正，是个优秀的共产党员。他十九岁起就在沈阳、唐山等地做小工，受着工头的封建压迫与剥削，直到二十六岁才回家。他在本村当战勤委员时，正值农会主任腐化分子张维业当权。去年八月，区里把张维业撤职了，党内开除了他的党籍，群众就公选郭万兴当村长。
    去年十一月秋征开始，他为了扭转过去干部晚交、不交，因而影响群众故意拖延不交公粮的现象，他个人首先交上，并号召全村干部也先交齐。然后向群众展开宣传，使全村征粮工作在两天内就完成了。
    去秋下大雨时，他村与白各庄因挡、扒水道，经常吵架。不但影响了两村人民的团结，并且乱挡乱扒水道的结果，使地里的积水得不到宣泄。庄稼眼看要涝了，他与支书张俊平就领导着群众，由张国正的谷子地里，挖开一条泄水沟（事前取得张国正的同意，因挖沟受到的损失，由得益户补偿给他）。从此泄下积水，三千亩庄稼免受水灾。两村群众都反映说：“郭万兴，真是个好村长，净办对大伙有利的事！”
    他为了克服流沙、完成今后旱田变水田的任务，决心发动群众打十来眼井，今春已完成两眼石井。在打井工作中，他又钻研出一种新打井法，即用四尺长、三尺宽、一寸厚的木板十五块（井愈深板子愈多），排成木圈一节一节地往下套着打，代替过去常用的苇圈。这样不但可更好地挡住流沙，并且木板可以长期使用，比使苇子还省钱。
    为了加强团结，他适当地运用了批评与自我批评。在党的小组会上，他常检讨自己工作中的缺点来启发别人，开展批评。去年他与支书张俊平，因年节他不同意给民兵送慰劳肉，两人吵起来。支书和民兵们都生了他的气，齐说：“搞分离吧！”他恐怕当时再往下说，会使双方感情破裂，影响今后工作，所以不声不响地就走开了。过了两天，他在支部会上以严肃的态度，向支书提出不能给民兵慰劳肉的道理，并提出批评。最后支书终于打通了思想，说：“那天我做错了。”从此以后他两人的团结更加紧密。
    去冬评产时，正是冻手冻脚的严冬天气。他领导着六个评议委员，在七天内一步步地走遍了二千三百一十二段地（八十六顷六十七亩）。妇女评议委员张秀云，连鞋子都走坏了，仍坚持着在地里一段段评等级。因拨粮拨差了一斤二两玉蜀黍，他曾与评议委员、管账人一夜不睡觉，把差数清查了出来。正月初，全村发土地证时，他忙得一天只吃一顿饭。
    因为他工作成绩显著，被选为县各界人民代表会、村农代会、县、区党代会的代表。
    现该村干部、农民，在他的团结领导下，大田一般的耘耪五、六遍，棉花四遍。全村五百多户中有二百多户已备齐了追肥。
