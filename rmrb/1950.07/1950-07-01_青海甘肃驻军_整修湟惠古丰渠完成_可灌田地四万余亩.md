Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th—The Qinghai and Gansu garrison troops have separately completed the renovation projects of the Huanghui Canal and the Gu Feng main canal. The Huanghui Canal is located in Dongheizizhen, Minhe County, Qinghai Province, with a total length of 31 kilometers and can irrigate more than 25,000 mu of land. The canal was dug in 1941. During the period of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, the canal was never renovated, resulting in the collapse of some water holes and siltation of the channels. A certain unit of the Qinghai garrison troops accepted the glorious task of renovating the canal at the end of March. During the renovation project, the unit converted the original tunnels into open channels, excavating a total of 80,000 cubic meters of earth. Under the slogan of "Strive to complete the project ahead of schedule and release water as soon as possible," all officers and soldiers launched a competition, averaging 6 cubic meters of earth excavated per person per day. The canal was fully completed on April 30 and water began to be released in early May. Local residents were very grateful and specially presented the canal-repairing troops with eight silk banners to express their gratitude.

A certain unit of the Gansu Hexi garrison troops completed the construction of the Gu Feng main canal, which is more than ten kilometers long, in 38 days. This canal is one of the famous canals in Hexi, starting from Henggou Gorge in Yongdeng County and extending to the boundary of Gulang County, capable of irrigating more than 15,000 mu of land. The canal has an extremely steep slope (with a difference of 500 meters between the starting and ending points), and the soil is loose and highly permeable, resulting in many difficulties in the project. The entire canal required 7,030 cubic meters of pebbles (equivalent to approximately 28,820,000 catties), meaning each person had to transport more than 49,000 catties of pebbles from two kilometers away on average. Under the slogan of "Everyone contributes ideas, everyone finds solutions," the soldiers had many innovations in their work, and work efficiency was continuously improved as a result. The main canal was completed in early May, and it is planned to complete the entire canal project by the end of July. During the canal repair period, local residents constantly came to offer their regards and presented flags to the troops. The old farmers of Xia Siwa Village said gratefully, "Our children and grandchildren will never forget the Liberation Army, even when they hold their rice bowls!"

　　青海甘肃驻军
    整修湟惠古丰渠完成
    可灌田地四万余亩
    【新华社西安二十八日电】青海、甘肃驻军已分别完成湟惠渠和古丰干渠的整修工程。湟惠渠位于青海省民和县东黑咀子，全长三十一公里，可灌地二万五千余亩。该渠于一九四一年凿成。在国民党反动统治时期，该渠从未经过整修，致部分水洞倒塌，渠道淤塞。青海驻军某部于三月底接受了整修渠道的光荣任务。整修工程中该部将原有暗洞改为明渠，共出土八万公方。全体指战员在“争取提前完工，早日放水”的口号下，展开竞赛，平均每人每天挖土达六公方。该渠已于四月三十日全部竣工，五月初开始放水。当地居民非常感激，特向修渠部队献赠锦旗八面，表示感谢。
    甘肃河西驻军某部，三十八天内修竣长达十余公里的古丰干渠。该渠为河西名渠之一，从永登县横沟峡起至古浪县境，可灌地一万五千余亩。该渠坡度极大（起终点相差五百公尺），加以土质稀松，渗漏性大，因之工程中困难极多。全渠需七千零三十公方卵石（约合二千八百八十二万斤），平均每人要从两公里外运来卵石四万九千余斤。在“人人出主意，个个想办法”的口号下，战士们在工作中有很多创造，工作效率因而不断提高。干渠已于五月初竣工，并计划于七月底完成全渠工程。修渠期间，当地居民曾不断前来慰问，并向部队献旗。下四洼村的老农们感激地说：“我们的子子孙孙端起饭碗，也忘不了解放军。”
