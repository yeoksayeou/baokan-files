The Origin of the New Flood in Northern Anhui
程瑞誴

Since late June, the Huai River basin has experienced widespread heavy rainfall. From June 27th to July 16th, the rainfall at Zhengyangguan reached 499 millimeters. On July 3rd alone, the rainfall was 113 millimeters. Due to this continuous heavy rain, the water level of the Huai River at Zhengyangguan began to rise from June 29th, reaching 5 meters by July 8th. At Sanhejian, about 90 kilometers upstream from Zhengyangguan, the water level was the same as the flood level in 1931; the flood level in the Laoguanxiang area was 0.7 meters higher than the current top of the embankment (repaired this year to the same level as the 1931 flood). Except for the yellow flood period, this was the highest flood level since 1931. Due to the surge of massive floodwaters in the Huai River and its tributaries, the Fuyang Prefecture suffered a severe flood.

The disaster in Fuyang Prefecture is a series of events. The three consecutive floods in May, July, and September of last year inundated 6.38 million mu of farmland, accounting for 37% of the prefecture's cultivated land, and affected 2.55 million people, accounting for 42% of the prefecture's population. In January and February of this year, due to the inability to drain accumulated rain and snow, another 1.74 million mu of land were inundated. Based on this severe disaster situation, the People's Government allocated a large amount of grain in March and April and, through work-for-relief programs, carried out large-scale embankment restoration and dredging projects on the basis of the winter repairs of the previous year. During the project, continuous overcast and rainy days inundated more than 3 million mu of farmland, and water accumulated everywhere, making embankment repair and dredging projects difficult. However, under the leadership of the People's Government and the efforts of the broad masses of the people, the Huai River and Ying River embankments, which were riddled with holes under the corrupt rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, were quickly restored. At the same time, this spring repair, combined with production and disaster relief, enabled the vast majority of disaster victims to survive the spring famine and connect with the wheat harvest through work-for-relief, thereby stabilizing social order and further strengthening the ties between the government and the people.

But where did the consecutive years of disasters come from? This is something that every person in Northern Anhui will never forget. In 1938, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, disregarding the lives and deaths of millions of people, breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in Henan Province. From then on, the turbid Yellow River water flowed along the ground slope, inundating large areas of land in Henan, invading Northern Anhui, and flooding everywhere along a narrow plain between the Ying River and the Wo River, creating the Yellow River flooded area in Henan and Anhui, and then pouring into the Huai River. Before the Yellow River flood, the Huai River, because the riverbed could not accommodate its own floodwaters, suffered a flood every four or five years. After the Yellow River flood, the situation of flooding became even more difficult to manage due to the addition of massive floodwaters. The flooding of Yellow River water in this area continued for ten years, until Huayuankou was blocked and restored in 1947, and the Yellow River returned to its original course. During these ten years, the area directly inundated by Yellow River water in Fuyang Prefecture alone reached 16.7 million mu.

Although the disaster caused by the Yellow River water created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits has been eliminated, the serious wounds left in this area cannot be recovered in a short time. Because the Yellow River water contains a large amount of sediment, it first silted up the river channels and ditches in this area. As a result, the local riverbed was silted up, reducing the water discharge of each river, raising the water level of each river, and making it difficult for the major ditches connected to the river to discharge rainwater, and the river water would backflow into the ditches when the river water was slightly higher. The river channel gradually silted up and became shallow, and the water level upstream of the shallow section became higher and higher, and the river channel became wider and shallower, and rainwater accumulated in it, forming lakes. The mouths of the large ditches that flowed into each river were also mostly silted up. The original culverts for draining accumulated water in the interior lost their effectiveness due to the relative changes in terrain. Rainwater from farmland could not be drained into the river through ditches, and could only flow horizontally across the land, inundating farmland and accumulating in low-lying areas, forming lakes, swamps, and wetlands. There were not enough ditches in Fuyang Prefecture in the first place, and now the situation is even more serious after being silted up by the Yellow River water. The floods in the past two years have been inundated due to poor drainage under such circumstances. Even if the river channel does not breach, it will form a continuous disaster situation of "small rain, small disaster, big rain, big disaster." Like this spring, only 100 millimeters of rain fell, and more than 1 million mu of farmland in the interior were inundated.

The Yellow River flooded this area for a full ten years, and the disasters left behind, and the floods of the Huai River itself, cannot be solved in a short time. Today, the urgent demand of the masses is the complete and thorough cure of the Huai River and the solution of the drainage problem in the area. Now the Huai River Engineering Bureau is formulating a five-year water management policy and plan starting from 1951 based on this requirement, preparing to basically eliminate the disasters of the Huai River in two or three years.

　　皖北新水灾的由来
    程瑞誴
    六月下旬以来，淮河流域普降大雨。正阳关从六月二十七日起至七月十六日止，降雨量达四百九十九公厘。其中七月三日一天，即降雨一百一十三公厘。由于这连续的大雨，正阳关的淮河水位，从六月二十九日就开始上涨，到七月八日涨到了五公尺。在正阳关以上约九十公里的三河尖，水位已和一九三一年的洪水位相平；老观巷一带的洪水位已高出现在的堤顶（本年修至和一九三一年洪水位平）○·七公尺。除了黄汛时期以外，这是一九三一年以来还没有过的最高洪水位。由于淮河及其支流巨量洪水的暴涨，阜阳专区遭受了严重的水灾。
    阜阳专区的灾情是一连串的。去年五、七、九各月连续的三次水灾，就淹没了农田六百三十八万市亩，占全区耕地的百分之三十七，受灾人口二百五十五万，占全区人口的百分之四十二。今年一、二月份，由于雨雪积水排泄不及，又陆续淹地一百七十四万亩。根据这一严重灾情，在三、四月间人民政府曾拨出大批粮食，通过以工代赈，在去年冬修的工程基础上，又进行了大规模的复堤和疏浚工程。在工程进行期间，又因连日阴雨，淹没农田三百多万亩，到处积水，使修堤和疏浚工程也遭到了困难。但在人民政府的领导与广大人民的努力下，终于把过去蒋匪腐败统治下，千疮百孔的淮河、颍河两堤很快修复。同时，这一次春修，结合生产救灾，通过以工代赈使绝大多数的灾民度过了春荒，接上麦收，因此安定了社会秩序，更密切了政府和人民的联系。
    但连年的灾害究竟是从那儿来的呢？这是每个皖北人民永远不会忘记的。在一九三八年，蒋介石匪帮不顾千百万人民的死活，在河南境内的花园口扒开了黄河大堤。混浊的黄水，从此就顺着地面斜坡，淹没河南大片的土地，侵入皖北，沿着颍河和涡河中间的一片狭长的平原，到处泛滥，造成豫皖黄泛区，然后涌进淮河。淮河在黄泛以前，因为河槽容纳不下本身的洪水，每隔四、五年要闹一次水灾，黄泛后加上巨量的洪水，泛滥的局面更难收拾了。黄水在这一区域里的泛滥，一直继续了十年，到一九四七年花园口堵复，黄河才回返故道。在这十个年头中间，仅阜阳专区直接被黄水淹没过的田地就达一千六百七十万亩。
    蒋匪制造的黄水的灾害虽已免除，但给这一地区遗留下的严重创伤，还不可能在短时间内恢复。因为黄水含有大量的泥沙，首先就把这一区域里的河道、沟洫淤塞。因之，河床局部淤高，而减低了各河的泄水量，抬高了各河的水位，使通河的各大沟雨水排泄发生了困难，河水稍大即倒灌入沟。河道逐渐淤浅了，浅段的上游水位愈抬愈高，河槽就变得愈宽愈浅，雨水积潴其中，造成了湖泊。汇入各河的大沟口也大多淤高。原有排泄内地积水的涵闸，由于地形的相对变化，也失却了效用。农田的雨水没有沟洫排除，流不到河里去，只有遍地横流，淹没田地，积潴到低洼地区，造成湖泊、沼泽和湿地。阜阳专区原有的沟洫就不够多，现在经过了黄水淤塞后，情况就更加严重了。去、今两年的水灾，都是在这样的情况下，由于排水不畅而受淹的。即使河道不决口，也会形成“小雨小灾，大雨大灾”的连续灾情。像今春只下了一百公厘的雨，内地农田就淹没了一百多万亩。
    黄河在这一区域，整整地泛滥了十年，遗留下的灾害，和淮河本身的洪水，不是一个短时间可以解决的。今天群众的迫切要求是淮河彻底的根治和解决区内的排水问题。现在淮河工程总局正根据了这一要求，确定了从五一年起的五年治水方针和计划，准备在二、三年内基本消灭淮河的灾害。
