The Waves of the Dadu River
    Yaguang

    Editor's Note: Comrade Yaguang was a "little devil" in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army, and participated in the 25,000-li Long March. This is a poem he wrote to commemorate this year's August 1st Army Day, recalling the daring crossing of the Dadu River.

    The waves of the Dadu River are high and mighty,
    The rolling whirlpools are deep and vast,
    Waves, oh waves, surging, surging,
    The water is swift, as fast as the wind.
    The riverbanks are shrouded in morning mist,
    On the river滩 appear the anti-Japanese vanguard.
    The eighteen heroes are eager and ready,
    Unafraid of the swift water, unafraid of the high waves.
    Listen, boom—splash! boom—splash!
    Mortar shells explode beside the enemy,
    Heavy machine guns fill the enemy fortifications with dust.
    Look, the vanguard captain waves the red flag,
    The instructor has already raised his pistol:
    "Comrades, look!
    The enemy is fleeing in all directions,
    The positions are in a chaotic mess,
    Comrades, follow me forward!"
    The eighteen heroes boarded the boat,
    The warship darted into the white waves like an arrow.
    Waves, oh waves, ten feet high,
    Spray, oh spray, splashing into the cabin,
    Boatmen, oh boatmen, paddling desperately,
    Party members, oh Party members, raising arms:
    "Charge! Charge!
    Fight through! Fight through! Fight through!"
    Enemy bullets fly overhead,
    Whizzing past and falling beside the boat.
    Ten-foot high waves, oh,
    Brave warship, oh,
    Cutting through the bullets, cutting through the white waves.
    The enemy lets out a mournful cry,
    The "officials" abandon their horses and flee,
    The supporting people cheer and shout:
    "The Red Army fights well!
    The Red Army fights wonderfully!
    The eighteen heroes are terrific!"
    The cheering on the riverbank
    Drowned out the raging waves of the Dadu River.

　　大渡河的浪花
    亚光
    编者按：亚光同志是人民解放军的前身工农红军中的一个“小鬼”，曾参加二万五千里长征。这是他为了庆祝今年的八一建军节而作的一首回亿强渡大渡河的诗。
    大渡河的浪花高又高，
    滚滚的漩涡深又大，
    浪花哪，奔腾，奔腾，
    水急哪，快如风。
    河岸上晨雾迷蒙，
    河滩上出现了抗日的先锋。
    十八英雄磨拳擦掌，
    不怕水急，不怕浪高。
    听吧，咚—哗！咚—哗！
    迫击炮弹爆炸在敌人身旁，
    重机枪打得敌人工事尘土飞扬。
    看哪，先锋队长挥动着红旗，
    指导员已经扬起了手枪：
    “同志们，看！
    敌人东奔西逃，
    阵地乱七八糟，
    同志们，跟我前进！”
    十八英雄上了船，
    战船箭一般窜进了白浪。
    波浪哪，一丈高，
    浪花哪，打进舱，
    船夫哪，拼命划，
    党员哪，手臂扬：
    “冲呀！冲呀！
    打过去！打过去！打过去！”
    敌人的子弹在头上飞，
    掠过身边，落在船旁。
    一丈高的浪花呀，
    勇猛的战船呀，
    穿过弹雨，穿过白浪。
    敌人发出悲伤的叫喊，
    “官长”丢下马儿逃亡，
    助战的老百姓举手欢呼：
    “红军打得好！
    红军打得妙！
    十八英雄呱呱叫！”
    河岸上欢呼的声音
    吞没了大渡河的巨浪。
