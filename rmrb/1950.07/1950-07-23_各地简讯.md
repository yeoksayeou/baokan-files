　　Many Workers at Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory Fall Ill
　　Recently, many workers at the Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory have fallen ill. More than 300 workers are on sick leave, and an average of more than 800 people seek medical attention day and night. Gastrointestinal diseases account for the majority of cases. The factory's sanitation facilities have improved this year compared to previous years. The recent increase in sick workers is due to insufficient health publicity and education, workers eating snacks casually, insufficient sleep for workers, and a tense lifestyle. The factory has convened an enlarged meeting of Party, government, trade union, and Youth League representatives, calling on workers not to eat snacks, to pay attention to the hygiene of workshops and dormitories, to observe working hours, and to eliminate bedbugs in order to reduce the number of sick workers.
