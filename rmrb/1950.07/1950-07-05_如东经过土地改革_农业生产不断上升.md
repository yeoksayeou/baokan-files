　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. The rural areas of Rudong County (formerly Rugao County) in northern Jiangsu Province, which completed land reform and eliminated feudal exploitation, have consistently seen rising agricultural production in recent years, despite the severe devastation caused by the Kuomintang reactionary army during the Liberation War. Taking Yuanhe Village in the county as an example, before land reform, the average yield per mu of rice in Yuanhe Village was 132 jin. In the three years from 1946 to 1948 after land reform, despite the serious devastation by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the average yield per mu still increased to 149 jin. Last spring, when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced southward, more than 25,000 farmers in the county participated in the war to support the front. Under these circumstances, all the women and semi-able-bodied laborers in the rural areas actively participated in agricultural labor, completing the heavy tasks of spring plowing, spring sowing, summer harvesting, and summer planting; in addition, more than 50,000 mu of wasteland was reclaimed.

This year, the enthusiasm of the county's farmers for production is even higher. Under the leadership of the People's Government, they have been fully preparing for this year's production increase campaign since November last year. In addition to extensively launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign, they also universally added agricultural tools and draught cattle. This year, one district, Fengli District, added 47 new-style waterwheels and 173 wheel sheds. According to county-wide statistics, more than 100 head of draught cattle were purchased this year. This spring, the county People's Government further mobilized farmers to formulate plans for increasing production and becoming prosperous by evaluating and rewarding production models, and then formulated a county-wide production plan to increase production by half to one level. Subsequently, a warm spring plowing and sowing campaign was widely launched throughout the county. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied to spring fields and wheat fields in the county is more than in any previous year: the average amount of fertilizer applied to each mu of spring field is more than 10 dan; the application of fertilizer to wheat fields has also generally increased from once to twice. The phenomenon of planting without fertilizing has been eliminated throughout the county. Farmers have also made great improvements in farming methods. For example, breaking with the old practice, wheat was hoed this spring, resulting in a good wheat harvest this year; all spring fields were plowed twice, and excellent varieties were selected; and the sowing method was mostly changed from broadcasting to row sowing.

### 如东经过土地改革  农业生产不断上升

　　如东经过土地改革  农业生产不断上升
    【新华社上海三日电】完成了土地改革、消灭了封建剥削的苏北如（皋）东县农村，在解放战争中虽曾遭国民党反动军队的严重摧残，但几年以来，该县农业生产却一直是上升的。以该县元和村为例：土地改革以前，元和村每亩田的平均产量是稻米一百三十二斤，土地改革后的一九四六年到一九四八年三年中，虽在蒋匪的严重摧残下，每亩平均产量仍能增至一百四十九斤。去年春季解放军渡江南进，该县曾有二万五千多农民参战，支援前线。在此情况下，农村中全体妇女和半劳动力都踊跃参加了农业劳动，完成了繁重的春耕春播和夏收夏种；另外还开了五万多亩荒地。
    今年该县农民生产热情更加高涨。在人民政府的领导下，他们从去年十一月开始就为今年的增产运动作了充分的准备工作。他们除广泛展开积肥运动外，还普遍添置了农具和耕牛。该县丰利区一个区今年即新添了新式水车四十七部，车篷一百七十三个。全县统计今年共增购耕牛一百余头。今春，该县人民政府更以评选和奖励生产模范的办法，普遍发动农民订立了增产发家的计划，并进而订出了全县增产半成到一成的生产计划。接着，热烈的春耕播种运动即在全县广泛展开。今年该县春田和麦田的施肥量均较以往任何一年为多：每亩春田平均施肥达十多担；麦地施肥亦普遍由一次增至两次。全县已消灭了种田不施肥的现象。农民们在耕作方法上亦有很大改进。如打破旧例，在今春进行了锄麦，使今年获得了一个好的麦收；所有春田都犁过两遍，并选种了优良的品种；播种方法也多由撒播改为条播。
