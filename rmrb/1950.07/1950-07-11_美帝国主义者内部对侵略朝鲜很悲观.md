　　Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: As the U.S. military suffers defeats in its invasion of Korea, U.S. imperialists are expressing increasingly pessimistic views about the situation in Korea. According to an Associated Press report, U.S. government officials "are beginning to assess the Korean War as a long-term, difficult, and costly struggle for the United States. The increasingly pessimistic outlook for an early end to the conflict means that the need for U.S. troops, armaments, and money in the war zone is increasing." U.S. officer McClure, who lived in South Korea for a long time, admitted, "Many South Koreans are not interested in the war, mainly because South Koreans hate us (referring to the U.S. military)."
    U.S. government officials revealed that while American warmongers are doing their utmost to carry out the war of aggression in Korea, they "are facing the following two needs: (1) To maintain the shipment of ten billion dollars worth of munitions to Western Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. (2) To prepare the U.S. military itself." This makes them anxious that "if the Korean war is prolonged and requires a large number of weapons, U.S. aid to Europe may be reduced before the war ends."

　　美帝国主义者内部对侵略朝鲜很悲观
    【新华社十日讯】随着美军在朝鲜侵略作战的失败，美帝国主义者内部对朝鲜的局势发出愈来愈悲观的论调。据美联社消息：美国政府官员“正开始估计朝鲜战事，认为它对于美国来说，是一个长期的困难的与代价很高的斗争。对早日结束这个冲突的前景抱有更不乐观的态度的发展，是意味着美国在该战争地区的军队、军火与金钱的需要日益增加”。曾在南朝鲜长期住过的美国军官麦克鲁尔承认：“许多南朝鲜人对战争不感兴趣，主要的原因是南朝鲜人恨我们（指美军）”。
    美国政府官员透露：当美国战争贩子们正竭其全力在朝鲜进行侵略战争时，他们“正面对着下列的两个需要：（一）维持十亿元的军火运至西欧、中东与东南亚。（二）准备好美国本身的军队”。这就使得他们焦虑“韩国战事的时间如果延长并需要大量武器，则在战事结束以前，欧洲得到美国的援助可能减少”。
