　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 6th: Amidst the French people's widespread opposition to the policies of war and poverty and their calls for the establishment of a democratic coalition government, the French cabinet crisis remains unresolved. Bourgeois politicians are scrambling to piece together a new cabinet from discredited factions, but their attempts have repeatedly failed.

　　After the fall of the Bidault cabinet, French President Auriol successively proposed five people to form a cabinet. The fifth person entrusted with forming a cabinet was Guy Mollet of the Radical Socialist Party, who reluctantly formed a new cabinet eight days after Bidault's downfall (on the 2nd of this month). In this new cabinet, Bidault served as Deputy Prime Minister, Schuman remained as Foreign Minister, and the notorious "gravedigger of France," Reynaud, was appointed as the head of the newly established Ministry of Federal Relations and Far Eastern Affairs. This new cabinet, composed of American lackeys, was welcomed with satisfaction by Washington diplomatic circles. According to Agence France-Presse's Washington dispatch on the 2nd, "these people were particularly pleased to see Schuman remain as Foreign Minister…". They "also praised the election of Reynaud to this position, which is of particular importance in the current environment." However, the Mollet cabinet was so fragile, and they were so lacking in confidence, that when Mollet took his cabinet list to the National Assembly for a vote, he "already had his resignation letter in his pocket" (Reuters). Sure enough, his cabinet list was rejected in the National Assembly on the evening of the 4th by a vote of 334 to 221. The French Communist Party firmly opposed this cabinet; and the Socialist Party, which was engaged in political speculation, also voted against it in the vote.

　　Before and after the fleeting appearance of the Mollet cabinet, the French working people and democrats resolutely demanded the organization of a democratic coalition government. Resolutions and petitions demanding this from the French President flew in like snowflakes from all over the country. The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement on June 29th, calling on the working people to participate in the struggle to win the organization of a democratic coalition government that relies on the support of the people and implements policies of freedom, full employment, and improvement of the status of the working masses.

    总工会号召劳动人民参加斗争
    政客们拼凑新阁的企图一再失败
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎讯：在法国广大人民反对战争与贫困的政策和要求建立民主联合政府的呼声中，法国的内阁危机还未解决。资产阶级的政客们手忙脚乱地从信誉扫地的阵营中拼凑新阁的企图一再失败。
    法总统阿里奥尔在皮杜尔内阁垮台后，曾先后提出五人出组内阁。第五个受命组阁的是激进社会党的葛义，他于皮杜尔倒台八天之后（本月二日），曾勉强组成了新阁。在这一新阁中，皮杜尔任副总理，舒曼留任外长，并由恶名昭著的“法兰西掘墓人”雷诺出长新设之联邦关系及远东事务部。这一由美国仆从们组成的新阁，受到华盛顿外交界人士的满意欢迎。据法新社华盛顿二日消息，“这些人士看到舒曼留任外长，……尤感愉快”。他们“并称赞推选雷诺出任这个在目前环境下有特殊重要性的职位”。可是，葛义内阁是如此的脆弱，他们是如此没有信心，当葛义带着他的内阁名单到国民议会去表决时，他“已随身在衣袋中带着辞职书”（路透社）。果然，他的内阁名单于四日晚在国民议会中以三三四票对二二一票被否决。坚决反对这一内阁的是法国共产党；而进行政治投机的社会党在表决中也投了反对票。
    在昙花一现的葛义新阁出现的前后，法国劳动人民和民主分子坚决要求组织民主联合政府。向法国总统提出此项要求的决议和请愿书，从全国各地如雪片飞来。法国总工会执行局于六月二十九日发表声明，号召劳动人民参加斗争，争取组织一个依靠人民支持的执行自由与充分就业和改善劳动群众地位的政策的民主联合政府。
