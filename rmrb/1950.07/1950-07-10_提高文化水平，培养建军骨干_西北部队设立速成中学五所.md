　　Raising Cultural Levels, Cultivating Military Backbone
    Northwest Troops Establish Five Accelerated Middle Schools
    [Our Newspaper] In order to raise the cultural level of cadres and soldiers and cultivate military backbone, the Shaanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Shaanxi have established five accelerated middle schools. There are currently 2,700 students, the vast majority of whom are revolutionary soldiers with more than three years of military service, recommended by their organizations and admitted after passing entrance exams. Among the 593 students in the accelerated middle school run by a certain army, 57 are company-level cadres, 413 are platoon-level cadres, and 122 are soldiers (including support staff). With the exception of 17, all are under 28 years old. Among them, 567 are Communist Party members. Those of peasant origin account for 585. Two hundred and nine have been credited with meritorious service. After enrollment, students underwent a level placement test. Those with the equivalent of a higher primary school education were placed in the regular course (three classes, graduating in two years); those with the equivalent of a junior primary school education were placed in the preparatory course (six classes. The preparatory course is one and a half years, after which they advance to the regular course); there are also two affiliated primary school classes. Graduates can reach the level of junior high school graduates and can further study military science and master modern military technology.
