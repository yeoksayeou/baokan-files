American Aggressors and the United Nations
    Chen Yongyi
    The attempts of American imperialists to use the guise of the United Nations to cover up their bandit-like adventures in Korea have gone beyond all bounds. The Security Council, with six members (six plus a Kuomintang representative!), retroactively endorsed the American armed intervention in Korea, declared the American troops in Korea as "United Nations forces" on July 7, and granted the command of these troops "full powers of the United Nations," even bestowing upon it the United Nations flag. Along with the armaments shipped to Korea, there were also armbands bearing the United Nations emblem for the American soldiers to wear!
    It is difficult to commit a more despicable insult to the United Nations flag, its charter, principles, and spirit. The American aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a malicious violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. This fact cannot be whitewashed by any illegal resolutions of the American bloc in the Security Council. From the standpoint of international law and the United Nations Charter, what the United States has done in Korea is an act of aggression launched without provocation, a destruction of peace, and a war of plunder, the purpose of which is to deprive Korea of its national independence and establish an anti-people regime there, under which Korea would be transformed into an American colony and its military strategic springboard in the Far East.
    In the statement of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko on July 4, detailed information was cited from very accurate documents, mentioning the preparations and implementation of Washington's long-planned aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    The aggressiveness of the American adventurous acts is so obvious to everyone that even newspapers accustomed to telling lies became incoherent and self-contradictory, showing panic and disarray when commenting on Gromyko's statement.
    New facts and documents confirming the aggression appear every day. Among them are the statements of former Commander-in-Chief of the South Korean National Defense Army Song Ho-seong and former South Korean Minister of Interior Kim Hyo-seok, which fully exposed the criminal plans of the American imperialists against the Korean people. A photograph taken by an American journalist when Dulles was instructing Rhee Syngman's military officers in a trench near the 38th parallel was published in many newspapers around the world. The tearful descendants of Dulles and his accomplices may not preserve this photograph. However, this photograph will have an appropriate place in the evidence of the lawsuits in the future court that will try the aggressors.
    The American government has taken a hostile action against peace by carrying out military intervention in Korea with its land, sea, and air forces. It must bear full responsibility for the consequences of the armed aggression it has adopted. In order to justify this intervention, it has not hesitated to directly and shamelessly violate the United Nations Charter. The Security Council's resolution supporting armed intervention in Korean internal affairs is illegal because it was passed without the participation of two permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union and China—and without their votes. According to the Charter, these resolutions cannot but be illegal. Another fact that violates the principles of the United Nations Charter is that the Security Council did not listen to the opinions of the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Another fact that violates the United Nations Charter and its principles is the decision of the American government to send a fleet to Taiwan to strengthen its troops in the Philippines and intervene in the war in Vietnam. All of these are armed interventions in the internal affairs of other countries.
    In response to Trygve Lie's notification regarding the resolution of a group of members of the Security Council on July 7 to provide troops and other means for the so-called "United Command under American leadership" and to use the United Nations flag in the course of military operations in Korea, the Soviet government declared that this resolution also had no legal effect, because its passage, like the resolution of June 27, was the most barbaric violation of the United Nations Charter.
    "The purpose of the above-mentioned resolution of the Security Council is to illegally use the United Nations flag to cover up the American armed action in Korea, which is a direct act of aggression by the United States against the Korean people.
    Due to the above, the Soviet government has reason to declare the Security Council's decision of July 7 as: 1. illegal; 2. direct support for the armed aggression against the Korean people."
    This illegal attempt to cover up the American aggression in Korea with the United Nations flag clearly highlights the subversive activities of the American ruling clique in the United Nations, and their attempt to transform this organization into a branch of the State Department.
    Naturally, Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie and a group of Security Council members obediently approved the American resolutions on June 25 and 27. Just as they can hand over the blue flag of the United Nations to MacArthur, they can raise the American Stars and Stripes over Lake Success, but the essence of the matter has not changed because of this.
    "The United Nations organization can only fulfill its duty to maintain peace if the Security Council demands an unconditional cessation of American military intervention and the immediate withdrawal of American armed forces from Korea." - These words in Gromyko's statement explain the only correct view of the role and task of the United Nations organization in the Korean event. If this direct task is not carried out, if the United Nations does not act in accordance with what its Charter requires, it is only because the activities of this organization have in fact been paralyzed due to the efforts of politicians in Washington and London. The Korean event clearly shows why the American and British representatives are so stubbornly and stubbornly preventing the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China from entering the United Nations, and thus making it impossible for the Soviet Union to participate in the Security Council meetings.
    As can be seen from the reaction to Gromyko's statement, progressive people in all countries around the world believe that the Soviet policy has made a great contribution to the cause of peace, and it has pointed out the actions of the American ruling clique in every detail. It is worth noting that the bourgeois mouthpiece newspapers of various countries are not unanimous in their evaluation of the American aggression in Korea. On these newspapers, one can find extremely critical and calm opinions on this matter and on the illegal resolutions of the Security Council. For example, the British "Manchester Guardian" believes that the United Nations "will feel remorse" for the "ugly allies" of Rhee Syngman and Bao Dai imposed on it by the United States.
    In addition, within the American bourgeoisie itself, there are also serious doubts about the outcome of this adventure that has already begun.
    The response of the public opinion and even the governments of the Marshallized countries themselves to the American demand to make the bandit-like aggression against Korea a "common cause" proves that the American wishful thinking of turning the United Nations into a broad military alliance to deal with the Soviet Union, to deal with the People's Democracies, and to deal with the entire democratic camp is built on sand.
    The contradictions within the imperialist camp are particularly powerfully manifested in the Korean issue. India and Egypt's refusal to support the July 7 resolution to raise the United Nations flag at MacArthur's headquarters; the fact that the United States had to change its enormous pressure on some countries to make them recognize the aggression against Korea - all of this exposes the unease of American imperialism's position.
    Isn't it a good proof that there is opposition in the Labour Party group against the Attlee-Bevin government's support for the adventure in Korea? Isn't it a good proof that in the past two weeks, 400,000 signatures on the Stockholm Appeal to ban atomic weapons have been collected in New York, and most of these signatures were collected after Truman ordered the intervention in Korea?
    The more blatant the aggressiveness and plundering nature of Washington's policies, the more the war-mongering clique isolates itself in the world. The people of the world have cursed and condemned the American aggression in Korea. The Soviet government believes that interference in Korean internal affairs is intolerable, and its firm policy has gained the understanding and support of the broadest social groups in all countries around the world.
    The international movement responding to the heroic struggle against the interventionists and striving for the unification and national independence of their country by the Korean people most clearly illustrates the isolated position of the American aggressors since the first day of the Korean War. They expect the slander and distortion of bourgeois newspapers to prevent ordinary civilians from figuring out who is on the side of right and justice and who should be responsible for launching the bloody war, but their expectations are in vain. The sympathy of millions of working people in all countries around the world is entirely on the side of the fighting Koreans. The surging waves of rallies and demonstrations in response to the Korean people prove this.
    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, in response to the appeal of the Korean Committee for the Defense of Peace to the World Peace Congress for assistance and support, calls for a cessation of intervention and calls on all peace advocates in all countries around the world to step up the collection of signatures on the Stockholm Appeal. The demand to stop American armed intervention, put forward by the representatives of billions of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal, has gained greater strength and weight. In most countries, accompanied by the continued collection of signatures, is a broad movement in response to the Korean people who are fighting against the interventionists. Worker delegations surrounded American embassies in various countries, demanding that American troops withdraw from Korean territory. Committees to support the Korean people have been established. The Australian Seamen's Union has declared that it will not transport military supplies to Korea. International democratic organizations - the World Federation of Trade Unions (more than 75 million members), the International Democratic Women's Federation (more than 80 million members), and the World Federation of Democratic Youth (more than 70 million members) - have called on all workers to respond with practical actions to the Korean people's national liberation struggle.
    The attempt to disguise a bandit-like war with the United Nations flag cannot help the American government "save face". Who can be deceived by this trick of the peacebreakers? MacArthur and Bradley, who sent Flying Fortresses to bomb Korean cities, will always be murderers and war criminals, even if their headquarters is flying the stolen United Nations flag - "a light blue rectangle with a world map on it, surrounded by olive branches." No olive branch can cover up the fact that the United States is an interventionist, a peacebreaker, and it should bear the full responsibility and all the consequences of this serious crime.
    According to the latest reports, the American ruling clique has occupied the United Nations' broadcasts to Korea and will send these broadcasts through the "Voice of America" broadcast system and the British BBC Broadcasting Corporation. Now these two broadcast centers to Korea will end with the following words: "This is what the United Nations said." Perhaps, Washington politicians think this is a very persuasive broadcast to the Koreans. They are wrong. The "Voice of America" is not the voice of the United Nations. The true voice of the people of the world will reach Korea very well. For the Korean people who are fighting for their independence and against American interventionists, they will hear simple and solemn words from every corner of the earth, these words give them strength and courage: Get out of Korea! The cause of the Koreans is a just cause!

　　美国侵略者与联合国
    陈用仪
    美帝国主义者试图拿联合国的幌子来掩盖他们自己在朝鲜的强盗式的冒险，已经超越了一切的界限了。安全理事会六个理事（六个加上一个国民党代表！）事后追认了美国在朝鲜的武装干涉，在七月七日宣布美国在朝鲜的军队为“联合国军”，并付给这些军队的统帅部以“联合国全权”，甚至授给它以联合国旗帜。与军火一起运到朝鲜的，还有带有联合国徽号的袖章，以供美军士兵佩用！
    很难对联合国的旗帜，对它的宪章、原则和精神再作更卑鄙的侮辱了。美国对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵犯，是对国际法和联合国宪章的恶毒的破坏。这个事实是不能以安全理事会中的美国集团任何非法的决议所能粉饰的。从国际法和联合国宪章的观点上看来，美国在朝鲜所作所为，都是一种未经对方挑衅而自行动手的侵略行为，都是对和平的破坏，是一种掠夺战争，这个战争的目的是剥夺朝鲜的民族独立，在那地方设立反人民的统治，在这个统治的条件之下，就会把朝鲜变成为美国的殖民地和它在远东的军事战略跳板。
    在苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯七月四日的声明中，从非常准确的文件引用了详细的资料，说到华盛顿早已深谋远虑的对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵犯之准备和实行。
    美国冒险行为的侵略性，对于一切人都是这样的明显，以至连向来说惯了谎言的报纸在注释葛罗米柯声明的时候，都语无伦次，自相矛盾，表现出张皇和失措。
    证实了侵略的新的事实和文件，每天都有出现。其中有前南朝鲜护国军总司令宋虎声和前南朝鲜内务长官金孝锡的声明，很充分地暴露了美国帝国主义者反对朝鲜人民的罪恶计划。美国记者当杜勒斯在三八线附近战壕中训令李承晚军官的时候所摄取的一幅照片，登载在世界上许多报纸上面。杜勒斯和他同谋者的感激涕零的子孙们未必会保存这幅照片。不过这幅照片在将来会审判侵略者的裁判所的诉讼案罪证中，将有一席适当的地位。
    美国政府对和平作了一个敌意的行动，它用它陆海空军在朝鲜实行军事干涉。它所采用的武装侵略，其后果完全要由它负责。为了要证明这个干涉是正当的，它不惜直接而可耻地破坏了联合国宪章。安理会支持对朝鲜内政武装干涉的决议是非法的，因为它通过的时候，并没有经安理会两个常任理事国——苏联和中国——参加，而没有它们投票，根据宪章，这些决议就不能不是非法的。破坏联合国宪章的原则，还有一个事实，那就是安理会不听取朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的意见。破坏联合国宪章及其原则，还有一个事实，就是美国政府决定派遣舰队到台湾去，加强自己在菲律宾的军队，插足对越南的战争。这一切都是武装干涉他国内政。
    苏联政府回复赖伊关于七月七日安理会一群会员议决提供兵力和其他手段以供所谓“美国领导下的联合指挥部”使用并在在朝鲜的军事行动过程中使用联合国旗帜的通告，宣告这个决议也没有法律效力，因为它之通过，跟六月二十七日的决议一样，是对联合国宪章的最野蛮的破坏。
    “安理会上述决议的目的，在于非法利用联合国旗帜，以掩盖美国在朝鲜的武装行动，这是美国对朝鲜人民的直接侵略行为。
    由于上述种种，苏联政府有理由宣布：安理会七月七日的决定为：一、非法；二、对武装侵略朝鲜人民的直接支持。”
    拿联合国旗帜来掩盖美国在朝鲜的侵略行为的这个非法的尝试，明晰地强调出了美国统治集团在联合国的颠覆活动，强调出了他们把这个机构变成为国务院分支的企图。
    自然罗，联合国秘书长赖伊和一群安理会理事唯命是听地在六月二十五二十七日批准了美国的决议，他们之可以把联合国的蓝色旗帜交给麦克阿瑟，就正像可以把美国星条旗升起在成功湖上空一样，不过事情的本质还是没有因为这样而改变。
    “联合国组织只有在安全理事会要求无条件停止美国军事干涉与立即从朝鲜撤退美国武装部队的情况下，才能履行其维护和平的职责。”——葛罗米柯声明中这些字句说明了对联合国组织在朝鲜事件的作用与任务的唯一正确的观点。如果这个直接的任务没有执行，如果联合国不按照它的宪章所要求的去做，则那只是因为由于华盛顿和伦敦的政客们的努力，这个组织的活动事实上被瘫痪了。从朝鲜事件就可以看清楚，为什么美英代表如此顽固而横蛮地不让中华人民共和国的合法代表进入联合国，而因此使苏联不可能参加安全理事会会议。
    正如从对葛罗米柯声明的反响中看到，全世界各国进步人士都认为苏联的政策对和平事业作了一个伟大的贡献，它丝毫毕现地指出了美国统治集团的所作所为。值得注意的是各国资产阶级喉舌报纸，对美国在朝鲜的侵略的评价，并不是同心一意的，在这些报纸上，可以找到对这件事和对安理会非法决议一事极端批判而冷静的意见。例如，英国“曼彻斯特卫报”认为联合国对美国所强加于它身上的李承晚保大之流的“丑恶的同盟者”，“一定会感到良心懊悔。”
    除此之外，在美国资产阶级本身各集团中，也对这个已经开始的冒险的下场发生了严重的怀疑。
    马歇尔化国家本身的舆论以至政府，对美国使对朝鲜的强盗式的侵略成为“共同事业”的要求的反应证明了美国把联合国变为广泛的军事联盟以对付苏联，对付人民民主国家，对付整个民主阵营的如意算盘是建筑在沙上的。
    帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾特别有力地在朝鲜问题上表现出来了。印度和埃及之拒绝支持在麦克阿瑟总部竖起联合国旗帜的七月七日决议；美国之不得不改变了对一些国家的巨大的压力以使它们认可对朝鲜的侵略——这一切都暴露了美帝国主义阵地的不安性。
    工党集团中有反对派反对艾德礼、贝文政府支持在朝鲜的冒险，难道这不是很好的证明吗？最近两周来，在纽约收集了四十万个在斯德哥尔摩禁用原子武器的呼吁书上的签名，而且这些签名大半是在杜鲁门下令干涉朝鲜之后收集的，难道这不是很好的证明吗？
    华盛顿政策的侵略性和掠夺性愈来得露骨，战争贩子集团就愈加在全世界孤立自己。全世界人民群众都痛骂并斥责了美国在朝鲜的侵略。苏联政府认为干涉朝鲜内政是不可容忍的，它那坚定的方针获得了全世界各国最广泛的社会集团的了解和支持。
    响应进行着英勇的斗争以反对干涉者，争取自己国家统一与民族独立的朝鲜人民的国际运动，最清楚地说明了美国侵略者自朝鲜战争第一天起所处的孤立地位。他们期望由资产阶级报章的造谣和歪曲报道以妨碍普通平民弄清楚究竟权利和正义在谁一边而发动流血的战事的责任又应当由谁来负，可是他们的期望是徒劳无功的。全世界各国千百万劳动群众的同情是完全在战斗着的朝鲜一方面的。响应朝鲜人民的汹涌浪潮似的大会和示威都说明了这一点。
    世界保卫和平大会常设委员会答复朝鲜保卫和平委员会向世界保卫和平大会要求援助与支持的呼吁书，要求停止干涉行为并要求全世界各国一切和平拥护者加紧收集斯德哥尔摩呼吁书的签名。代表亿万在斯德哥尔摩呼吁书上签了名的人提出来的关于停止美国武装干涉的要求，获得了更大的力量和重量。在大多数国家中与继续进行着的收集签名相伴着的，是响应对干涉者作斗争的朝鲜人民的广泛的运动。工人代表团围着了各国美大使馆，要求美军撤出朝鲜领土。支援朝鲜人民委员会成立了。澳洲海员工会宣告不运军用物资到朝鲜去。国际民主组织——世界工会联合会（七千五百万以上会员），国际民主妇女联合会（八千万以上会员），世界民主青年联合会（七千万以上会员）——都号召一切劳动者以实际行动具体地响应朝鲜人民的民族解放斗争。
    拿联合国的旗帜来掩饰强盗式战争的企图，并不能帮助美国政府“挽回面子”。和平破坏者这个诡计又能迷惑了谁呢？派空中堡垒去轰炸朝鲜城市的麦克阿瑟和布莱德雷永远是一些杀人犯和战争罪犯，即使他们的总部上飘扬着偷来的联合国旗帜——“蔚蓝色长方形，上有世界地图，四周围以橄榄叶环”。任何橄榄叶环都掩盖不了这个事实，即美国是干涉者，是和平破坏者，这次严重罪行的全部责任及全部后果应由它来担负。
    据最后的报道，美国统治集团占据了联合国对朝鲜的广播并将通过“美国之音”广播系统和英国ＢＢＣ广播公司来发送这些广播。现在这两个对朝鲜的广播中心都将以下列的字句收场：“这是联合国说的。”可能，华盛顿政客们认为这是对朝鲜人很有说服作用的广播。他们错了。“美国之音”并不是联合国之音。全世界人民真正的声音会很好地到达朝鲜的。为了争取自己的独立，反对美国干涉者而战斗的朝鲜人民，将听到地球上每一个角落简单而庄严的字句，这些字句赋与了他们以力量和勇气：滚出朝鲜去！朝鲜人的事业是正义的事业！
