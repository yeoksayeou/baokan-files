Implementing the Spirit of the Second National Tax Conference
Local Tax Bureaus Discuss Improving Work

[This newspaper report] Following the conclusion of the Second National Tax Conference held in June, local tax bureaus successively convened meetings to discuss improving tax work in accordance with the spirit of the National Tax Conference. As of now, the Central South Administrative Region and cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Jinan have held tax conferences.

The Central South Region Tax Conference, held in late June, made specific arrangements to implement the provisions of the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations for the three collection methods of industrial and commercial tax: (1) In large and medium-sized cities or towns with larger-scale industry and commerce, the method of "self-declaration, account review, and tax calculation according to rates" can be selectively adopted for industrial and commercial enterprises with sound accounting practices. However, based on the existing work foundation, the number of industrial and commercial households collected using this method should temporarily account for approximately 3% to 5% of the total number of industrial and commercial households. After gaining experience, this will be gradually expanded. At the same time, four systems must be established: a unified invoice system, a unified bookkeeping system, a monthly business report system, and a tax bureau review and approval system. (2) Democratic appraisal will be used for approximately 40% to 60% of industrial and commercial households. Democratic appraisal is based on evaluating business turnover and income, and calculating taxes according to rates. A trial implementation of taxpayers self-reporting and paying business tax monthly, followed by a final report and appraisal every three months, will be conducted. The tax bureau will conduct typical investigations based on the self-reported business materials during normal times. (3) Expand the number of taxpayers subject to fixed-period and fixed-amount taxation. For small retail merchants in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and commercial taxes in small towns, the method of fixed-period and fixed-amount taxation will be used to concentrate the efforts of cadres on relatively large tax sources.

Other matters related to tax categories, tax items, tax rates, and tax collection procedures will be implemented in accordance with the decisions made at the National Tax Conference.

The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the Federation of Industry and Commerce held meetings on June 27th and July 6th, respectively, to convey the spirit of the National Tax Conference. The Tianjin Finance and Economics Committee and the Federation of Industry and Commerce unanimously supported the decisions of the Tax Conference. Yang Jian'an, a representative of the industrial and commercial sector who attended the National Tax Conference, said at the Federation of Industry and Commerce meeting: In order for the government to reduce the burden on industry and commerce, it is willing to save national expenditures as much as possible, so we in the industrial and commercial sector should also understand the government's concern, consciously assist the government in completing tax revenue tasks, and prevent possible tax evasion. The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee also decided to complete the collection of industrial and commercial taxes for the first half of the year by the end of August. Based on Tianjin's specific conditions, it is planned to adopt account review collection for approximately 1,000 households, democratic appraisal and tax calculation according to rates for approximately 22,000 households, and fixed-period and fixed-amount collection for approximately 21,000 households. A tax reconsideration committee composed of eleven people from the Municipal Tax Bureau, Industry and Commerce Bureau, Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Federation of Trade Unions will be formed to reconsider matters related to total collection amounts, disputes, and penalties.

The Jinan Municipal Tax Bureau decided that all factories with sound accounting books, fixed resident staff, and larger scale can adopt the method of self-declaration, account review, and tax collection according to rates. In the collection of summer business tax, this will be piloted in key industries such as the textile industry.

In addition, the East China Region Tax Conference held in Shanghai opened on the 5th of this month. Large administrative regions such as the Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast, as well as provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Suiyuan, are also preparing to convene meetings to convey and implement the decisions of the Second National Tax Conference. The Chahar Province has already conducted discussions at the Provincial People's Representative Conference.

(Editor's note: The Second National Tax Conference was held in Beijing from May 29th to June 17th. The participating tax personnel and representatives from the industrial and commercial sector widely discussed the past tax work; and, based on the new situation of finance and economy, made appropriate adjustments and revisions to the current tax laws, tax items, tax rates, and collection methods to make them more in line with the tax policy spirit stipulated in the Common Program. The conference unanimously believed that the past tax work had achieved great results. It promptly guaranteed the state's revenue, brought fiscal revenue and expenditure close to balance, and stabilized prices. However, there were also many shortcomings and errors in the past work. For example, the implementation rules were not published in a timely manner, resulting in inconsistent interpretations and applications of tax law provisions by local tax bureaus. Some tax categories, tax items, and management procedures that should have been simplified were not simplified in a timely manner; and the phenomenon of large squeezing small and small squeezing large occurred during the evaluation process. Therefore, the timely convening of this conference will greatly improve the future tax work. At the same time, the participating representatives unanimously recognized that the state's finances are still facing difficulties, and it is not possible nor should it be unilaterally emphasized to reduce the burden on the industrial and commercial sector. However, the conference still took care of some industrial and commercial enterprises that are currently facing difficulties, appropriately reduced their burden, so as to help them tide over the temporary difficulties in the current process of national economic transformation.)

　　贯彻第二次全国税务会议的精神
    各地税局讨论改进工作
    【本报讯】六月间举行的第二次全国税务会议闭幕以后，各地税局先后召开了会议，根据全国税务会议的精神讨论改进税务工作。截至目前为止，已有中南大行政区和北京、天津、济南等城市开过税务会议。
    六月下旬召开的中南区税务会议，为贯彻工商业税条例规定，对工商业税的三种征收办法，作了具体的布置：（一）在大中城市或工商业规模较大的城镇，可以有重点地对会计健全的工商业采用“自报查账依率计征”的办法。但根据现有的工作基础，用这个办法征收的工商业户数暂以约占工商户数百分之三至百分之五为宜。在取得经验后，再逐渐扩大。同时，必须建立四个制度，即：统一发票制度，统一簿记制度，营业情况月报制度，税局审查核准制度。（二）用民主评议的约占工商户数的百分之四十至六十。民主评议以评议营业额、所得额，并依率计征为原则。并且试办营业税由纳税人按月自报核缴，三个月终了，再行总报评议的办法。税局在平时即根据自报营业材料进行典型调查。（三）扩大定期定额纳税户数。大中城市的零星小商户以及小城镇的工商税，用定期定额的办法征收，以便集中干部力量用在比较大的税源上。
    其他有关税种、税目、税率和稽征手续等，决定按全国税务会议所决定的执行。
    天津市财经委员会和工商联合会分别于六月二十七日、七月六日召开会议，传达了全国税务会议精神。天津财委和工商联都一致拥护税务会议的决定。出席全国税务会议的工商界代表杨健庵，在工商联合会上说：为了政府减轻工商业的负担，宁愿尽量节省国家开支，所以我们工商界也应该体谅政府的关怀，自觉地协助政府完成税收任务，防止可能的漏税。天津市财委并决定在八月底以前完成上半年的工商业税的征收工作。根据天津的具体条件，计划采用查账征收的约一千户左右。用民主评议、依率计征的约二万二千户。用定期定额征收的约两万一千户。并由市税局、工商局、工商联、总工会等方面共十一人组成税务复议委员会，复议有关征收总额、争议和处罚等事宜。
    济南市税务局决定，凡账簿健全、有固定驻厂员、规模较大的工厂，都可采用自报查账、依率征收的办法。在征收夏季营业税中，先在纺织业等十三个行业中重点试行。
    此外，在上海召开的华东区税务会议已于本月五日开幕。西南、西北、东北等大行政区及河北、山西、平原、绥远等省亦正在准备召开会议，传达和贯彻二届全国税务会议的决定。察哈尔省已在该省各界人民代表会议上进行了讨论。                                       
             （超祺）
    （编者按：第二次全国税务会议系于五月二十九日在京召开，六月十七日闭幕。与会的各地税务工作人员及工商界代表，广泛讨论了过去的税收工作；并根据财政经济的新形势，对现行税法、税目、税率以及稽征方法等加以适当的调整与修改，使之更加符合共同纲领所规定的税收政策精神。会议一致认为过去的税收工作是有很大成绩的。它及时保证了国家的收入，使财政收支接近平衡，物价趋于稳定。但过去工作中也有不少缺点和错误。如施行细则没有及时公布，使各地税局对于税法条文的解释和引用有不一致之处。在税种、税目与管理手续上有些应简化的没有及时简化；在评议中又发生了大挤小，小挤大的现象等。因此这次会议的及时召开，将可使今后税收工作大大提高一步。同时到会代表们一致认识目前国家财政还有困难，还不可能也不应当片面强调减轻工商界的负担。但会议对于目前某些确有困难的工商业仍然加以照顾，适当减低了他们的负担，以便协助他们度过目前国民经济改造过程中的暂时性困难。）
