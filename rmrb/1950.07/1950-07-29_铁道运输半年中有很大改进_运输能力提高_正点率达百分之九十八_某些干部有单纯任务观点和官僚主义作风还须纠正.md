Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The railway transportation work of the People's Railways has greatly improved in the first half of this year. At the end of last year, the railway transportation capacity could only meet 60 to 70 percent of the consignor's requirements. Since the beginning of this year, due to the strengthening of unified planning, unified dispatching, improvement of lines and station equipment, and the active efforts of workers and staff, the transportation capacity has rapidly increased by 50 percent. In the past six months, the national railways have transported a total of more than 45.5 million tons of goods, mainly coal, grain, salt, cotton, timber, and cement, and transported more than 71 million passengers (the above two figures are still missing the materials for the Sino-Soviet Railway in May and June). At present, there are still 10,000 stored spare cars on various routes, indicating that the railway can undertake more transportation tasks.

The improvement of railway transportation efficiency is concentrated in the fact that the national average vehicle turnaround rate has been greatly shortened. In June of this year, it was 2.87 days, which was 1.26 days shorter than in November of last year, and 0.85 days less than the annual struggle target of 3.72 days this year.

The punctuality percentage of national passenger trains was less than 50 percent in January of this year, but by June, the punctuality rate of both departure and arrival had risen to more than 98 percent. The punctuality rate of freight trains, which was very low last year, also reached 96 percent for punctual departure and 93 percent for punctual arrival in June this year. The Northeast Railway and Tianjin Railway Bureau have further implemented a freight arrival forecast system, which provides great convenience to consignors.

In terms of passenger transport, the phenomenon of passenger congestion in the past has been basically overcome nationwide. The cleanliness and hygiene on trains and the service attitude of train attendants have also been greatly improved. In order to take care of passengers traveling long distances with children, "mother-child cars" have been added to direct trains. In addition, sixteen epidemic prevention stations have recently been established in important stations in the north and south.

Due to the rapid development of railway business, coupled with the purely task-oriented viewpoints and bureaucratic style of certain leading cadres, there is currently a tendency to simply pursue quantity in the work. For example, the quality of locomotive overhaul is not good enough, and the shortcomings of not strictly adhering to technical management regulations are still very serious. To this end, the Ministry of Railways decided that the business policy for the third quarter is to consolidate existing achievements, maintain quantity, and seek further development in overcoming the above shortcomings.

　　铁道运输半年中有很大改进
    运输能力提高  正点率达百分之九十八
    某些干部有单纯任务观点和官僚主义作风还须纠正
    【新华社二十七日讯】今年上半年人民铁道的运输工作已有很大改进。去年年底时，铁路运输能力还只能达到货主要求的百分之六十至七十。今年以来，由于加强统一计划、统一调度、改善线路及站场设备，和工人、职员的积极努力，运输能力便迅速提高了百分之五十。半年来，全国铁路以煤、粮、盐、棉花、木材、洋灰等为主，共运输货物达四千五百余万吨，运送旅客达七千一百多万人（以上两项数字内尚缺中长铁路五、六两月的材料）。目前各路还有封存备用车达一万辆，说明铁路还能担负更多的运输任务。
    铁路运输效率的提高集中表现的全国平均车辆周转率已大为缩短。今年六月为二点八七天，较去年十一月缩短了一点二六天，较今年全年奋斗目标三点七二天还少○点八五天。
    全国旅客列车正点百分比在今年一月份还不足百分之五十，但至六月份，出发和到达的正点率均已上升到百分之九十八以上。去年正点率很小的货物列车今年六月份也达到了百分之九十六正点出发，百分之九十三正点到达。东北铁路和天津路局已进一步做到货物到达的预报制度，给货主很大的方便。
    客运方面，在全国范围内已基本上克服了过去旅客拥挤的现象。列车上的清洁卫生和列车员的服务态度也有很大改善。为了照顾携带儿童作长途旅行的旅客，并在直达列车上加挂了“母子车”。此外，北方南方重要车站最近还设立了十六个防疫站。
    由于铁路业务发展很快，加以某些领导干部有单纯任务观点和官僚主义作风，因而目前工作中存在单纯追求数量的偏向。如机车检修质量不够好和不严格遵守技术管理规程等缺点还很严重。为此，铁道部决定第三季度的业务方针是巩固既有成绩，保持数量，在克服上述缺点中求得更进一步的发展。
