Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: In the rural areas of the old liberated areas of North China, where land reform was completed as early as 1947, after two years of production campaigns in the past two years, the vast majority of poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants have escaped poverty and generally improved their economic status.

According to a survey of 1,517 households in ten villages under the jurisdiction of Pingshan, Fuping, Dingxian, Hejian, Zunhua, and Weixian counties in Hebei Province: Among the 592 middle-peasant households before the land reform, 14 households have risen to become wealthy middle peasants; among the 553 poor-peasant households, 27 households have risen to become wealthy middle peasants, and 388 households have risen to become middle peasants. According to a survey of 964 households in five villages under the jurisdiction of Licheng, Lucheng, and Pingshun counties in Shanxi Province: In 1939 (before land reform), middle peasants accounted for 32.3% of the total number of households, poor peasants accounted for 42.4%, and farm laborers accounted for 5.4%. By 1949, the proportion of middle peasants had risen to 84%, becoming the vast majority in the countryside. A survey of 1,571 households in thirteen villages under the jurisdiction of Hunyuan, Shanyin, Zhangbei, Huailai, Longguan, and Yanqing counties in Chahar Province also illustrates the same situation. Among the original 767 poor-peasant households in the thirteen villages, 593 households have risen to become middle peasants, and four households have risen to become wealthy middle peasants; among the 570 middle-peasant households, five households have risen to become wealthy middle peasants, and one household has risen to become rich peasants.

The gradual escape from poverty by farmers is the result of a great leap forward in rural productivity and rapid recovery and development after land reform. According to a survey of five villages in Huguan County, Shanxi Province: The amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land in 1949 had increased by 12 dan compared to pre-war levels (the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu before the war was 43 dan); the number of farm tools was equal to pre-war levels. According to a survey of four villages, including Zhangba Village and Songshuping Village, under the jurisdiction of Zuoquan County in the same province, the existing number of draft animals has exceeded pre-war levels. The four villages had a total of 33 donkeys before the war and now have 75, an increase of 56%; they had a total of 57 cattle before the war and now have 90, an increase of 58%. At the same time, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land in the four villages before the war was 29 dan, and now it is 55 dan, an increase of 89%.

After land reform, farmers in the old liberated areas of North China encountered difficulties such as a lack of draft animals and farm tools, which hindered the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production. However, the People's Government provided farmers with all possible assistance within its means. In 1949 alone, the agricultural loans issued by the North China People's Government amounted to 582 million yuan, according to incomplete statistics. Over the past two years, farmers have used government loans to purchase a large number of livestock and farm tools. According to statistics from Shanxi Province alone, the number of draft animals has increased by 150,000 head. This year, the province may increase the number of draft animals by another 250,000 head. In addition, the assistance provided to farmers by the government through cooperatives has also been significant. Last year, cooperatives in various parts of North China supplied farmers with production materials (including seeds, farm tools, livestock, etc.) at low prices, with a total value of 107 million jin of millet. In this way, farmers overcame difficulties, enabling productivity to develop relatively quickly. However, farmers of all strata have the following ideas: Newly emerging middle peasants from poor peasant backgrounds believe, "In the past, others exploited us, but now we don't exploit others either. It's enough to live a good life." Middle peasants think, "We must work hard, so as not to fall down, and not to be too prominent." The original rich peasants think, "It's enough if we can just get by."

Over the past two years, a small number of farmers in North China have also declined in economic status. According to the aforementioned survey of ten villages in ten counties, including Pingshan County in Hebei Province: 7.25% of the original wealthy middle peasants have declined to become middle peasants, and 2.4% of the original middle peasants have declined to become poor peasants. According to the aforementioned survey of thirteen villages in six counties, including Hunyuan County in Chahar Province: 17 of the original 570 middle-peasant households have declined to become poor peasants. According to the aforementioned survey of five villages in three counties, including Licheng County in Shanxi Province: 3.55% of the original middle peasants have declined to become poor peasants, and those poor peasants who rose after land distribution and then declined again accounted for 3.55% of the original number of poor peasants. The burning, killing, and looting by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits for more than a decade have made farmers vulnerable to natural disasters and certain unfortunate events, as well as a lack of labor, draft animals, and farm tools, which are the main reasons for the decline of these small numbers of farmers. Among the 39 declining farmer households in five villages in three counties, including Licheng County in Shanxi Province: 14 households were due to illness and death of draft animals, eight households were due to a lack of labor, thirteen households were due to a lack of draft animals and farm tools, and four households were due to poor management. However, there are also individual farmers who have the "loafer" mentality of not wanting to engage in production properly. They are waiting to eat from the "big pot," selling the land and houses they were allocated, and妄想 (wang xiang - absurdly hoping) to wait for another distribution. Two farmer households in Hongjing Village, Licheng County, declined for this reason.

Based on the above situation, in leading rural production, the People's Governments at all levels in North China, in addition to doing their best to help farmers, have also paid attention to the following two tasks: First, they have repeatedly publicized the government's policies of rewarding production and rewarding hard work to get rich. For the "loafer" mentality of individual farmers who are unwilling to engage in production properly and妄想 (wang xiang - absurdly hoping) to rely on relief or "share" the wealth created by others through hard work, the government openly criticizes them among the peasant masses, explaining that doing so will only push themselves back onto the road to poverty. For hardworking farmers, the government helps them dispel ideological concerns about developing production and points out the path for them to further improve production by improving tools and improving technology. Second, they have implemented the policy of getting organized, using the principles of equivalence, voluntariness, and mutual benefit, and using their best efforts to organize farmers into cooperative mutual aid; enabling farmers to solve many production difficulties, escape poverty, and gradually become prosperous through mutual aid. For farmers who no longer feel a lack of labor and animal power, the government calls on them to "participate in mutual aid, become even richer." In short, vigorously organizing cooperative mutual aid is the basic method for making farmers' lives increasingly prosperous, for rapidly restoring, developing, and prospering the rural economy after land reform, and it is also the direction of farmers' development.

　　经过土地改革的华北老区农村绝大部分农民摆脱贫困
    各地注意宣传了奖励生产政策，大力组织了合作互助。
    【新华社七日讯】早在一九四七年完成了土地改革的华北老解放区农村，在经过去年和前年两年的生产运动之后，绝大部分贫农、雇农和中农摆脱贫困，普遍上升。
    据河北省平山、阜平、定县、河间、遵化、威县等县所属十个村共一千五百一十七户的调查：土地改革以前的五百九十二户中农中，已有十四户上升为富裕中农；五百五十三户贫农中，已有二十七户上升为富裕中农，三百八十八户上升为中农。另据山西省黎城、路城、平顺等县所属五个村共九百六十四户的调查：一九三九年（土地改革以前）中农全体户数中所占的比例为百分之三十二点三，贫农为百分之四十二点四，雇农为百分之五点四。一九四九年中农的比例数已上升为百分之八十四，成为农村中的绝大多数。又据察哈尔省浑源、山阴、张北、怀来、龙关、延庆等县所属十三个村共一千五百七十一户的调查，也说明同样的情形。十三个村中原有的贫农七百六十七户中，已有五百九十三户升为中农，四户升为富裕中农；五百七十户中农中，已有五户上升为富裕中农，一户上升为富农。
    农民逐渐摆脱贫困，是土地改革以后农村生产力大踏步地前进，迅速地恢复和发展的结果。据山西省壶关县五个村的调查：一九四九年每亩土地的施肥量已比战前增加了十二担（战前每亩平均施肥量为四十三担）；农具的数量已与战前相等。另据该省左权县属丈八村和松树坪村等四个村的调查，现有耕畜已超过了战前。四个村战前共有驴三十三头，现有七十五头，增加了百分之五十六；战前共有牛五十七头，现有九十头，增加了百分之五十八。同时，四个村战前每亩地平均施肥料二十九担，现在平均五十五担，增加了百分之八十九。
    土地改革后，华北老区农民曾遇到耕畜农具等困难，阻碍着农业生产的迅速恢复和发展。但人民政府给了农民以可能范围内的一切帮助。仅一九四九年，华北人民政府发放的农业贷款，据不完全的统计为五亿八千二百万元。两年来，农民用政府的贷款买进牲畜、农具的数量是很大的，仅据山西省统计，就增加了耕畜十五万头。今年该省还可能增加耕畜二十五万头。此外政府经过合作社给农民的帮助也很大。去年，华北各地合作社一年内低价供给农民的生产资料（包括种籽、农具、牲畜等）的总值为一亿七百万斤小米。这样，农民克服了困难，使生产力相当迅速地发展起来。但各阶层农民却有以下的几种想法：由贫农上升的新中农认为，“过去人家剥削咱，现在咱也不剥削人。日子过好就行了。”中农想，“不能不劳动，闹的不要掉下来，也不要太突出。”原来的富农则想，“光景能过也就算了。”
    两年来，华北农村中也有很少的农民下降了。据前述河北省平山等十县十个村的调查：原有的富裕中农有百分之七点二五下降为中农，原有的中农也有百分之二点四下降为贫农。前述察哈尔省浑源等六个县十三个村的调查：原有的五百七十户中农有十七户下降为贫农。前述山西省黎城等三个县五个村的调查：原有中农下降为贫农的为百分之三点五五，贫农在分得土地后上升而后又下降的占原有贫农数的百分之三点五五。十几年来的日寇和国民党匪军的烧杀抢掠，使农民经不起天灾和某些不幸事件，以及缺乏劳力、耕畜、农具等，是这些很少数的农民下降的主要原因。山西省黎城等三个县五个村下降的三十九户农民中：因疾病、耕畜死亡的有十四户，因没有劳动力的八户，缺乏耕畜农具的有十三户，不善经营的四户。但也有个别的农民，存在着不好好生产的二流子思想。他们等着吃大锅饭，把分到的地和房卖了，妄想等待再分。黎城县洪井村就有两户农民是因此下降的。
    依据上述情况，华北各地人民政府在领导农村生产上、除尽力帮助农民外，还注意进行了以下两项工作：第一、反复宣传了政府奖励生产和奖励劳动致富的政策。对于个别农民不愿好好经营生产而妄想靠救济、靠“共”别人勤劳致富之“产”的二流子思想，政府就在农民群众中予以公开批评，说明这样做只有将自己再推上贫困的道路。对于勤劳农民，政府就帮助他们解除发展生产的思想顾虑，并给他们指出改良工具、提高技术的进一步提高生产的道路。第二、贯彻了组织起来的政策，在等价、自愿、两利的原则下，用最大的力量组织农民合作互助；使农民们从互助中解决许多生产困难，摆脱贫困，逐步富强起来。对已经不感劳动力和畜力等缺乏的农民，政府就号召他们“参加互助，富了更富”。总之，大力组织合作互助，是土地改革后使农民生活日益富裕、使农村经济迅速恢复和发展、繁荣的基本方法，也是农民发展的方向。
