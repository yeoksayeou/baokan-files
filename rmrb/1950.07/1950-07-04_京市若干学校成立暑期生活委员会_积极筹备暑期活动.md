Several Schools in Beijing Establish Summer Life Committees to Actively Prepare for Summer Activities
Students Will Enjoy a Pleasant Summer Vacation!

[This Newspaper Reports] As summer vacation approaches, schools in Beijing are actively preparing for summer activities. Teachers and students in various schools have expressed satisfaction with the spirit of the Beijing Youth Summer Life Committee's decision to focus on diverse cultural, recreational, and sports activities during this year's summer vacation.

Several schools have formed leadership organizations for summer activities, such as summer life committees, composed of representatives from the school administration, the Communist Youth League, and student unions, to help students organize themselves and formulate various summer activity plans based on the "Summer Life Blueprint" published by the Municipal Summer Committee. School administrations are making every effort to assist students in carrying out summer activities and will keep libraries, laboratories, and other facilities open as usual during the summer. The Yu Ying Middle School administration is willing to subsidize students' summer activity expenses as much as possible. Many teachers are enthusiastically participating in the guidance work for various activities.

Most schools are beginning to establish various summer literary and artistic, and sports organizations, or strengthen existing extracurricular activities. According to preliminary statistics from ten schools in the Fourth District, there are already twenty-three literary and artistic organizations such as singing, dancing, and waist drum groups, and twenty-five sports organizations such as various ball games, gymnastics, and swimming groups. The situation in other districts is generally the same. Pingmin Middle School has also organized a torch relay team. Various research groups have also been widely established or are in the process of being organized. Those with a foundation, such as the Yu Ying Middle School Young Pioneers' animal and plant specimen groups (they once presented six specimens, including horseshoe crabs, Guan Gong crabs, small bats, and geckos, as gifts to the Soviet youth delegation); the Shandong Middle School's biology group, which dissected frogs; and the Chongci Girls' Middle School's chemistry group (which pickled many preserved eggs), are all prepared to continue their activities during the summer. The content of the research groups is generally combined with regular classes, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and Russian; there are also other research groups, such as the Chongde Middle School's photography research association, the Women's Fourth Middle School's current affairs research association, and the Beining Midwifery School's midwifery and anatomy group.

Some students have requested to conduct collective remedial lessons during the summer vacation. The reason why the Municipal Youth Summer Life Committee did not arrange this is because last year, after the initial liberation of Beijing, students urgently needed to receive ideological transformation and political education, so relatively centralized study groups and youth academies were held to carry out political and ideological education focused on establishing a revolutionary worldview, which was absolutely necessary. However, this year is different. New Democracy education has been widely carried out in various schools, and students' daily study life is already quite intense. Students should mainly rely on their own review during the summer vacation, and it is impossible to meet everyone's different requirements by holding concentrated courses within a short period of one month. At the same time, diverse cultural and recreational activities during the summer vacation not only allow students to rest and improve their health, but also make progress in their thinking and culture. However, it is feasible for schools such as Men's No. 1 Middle School, Fu Ren Men's Middle School, and Chongci Girls' Middle School to ask the school administration and teachers to assist in organizing appropriate cultural tutoring on campus, under the principle of not hindering necessary rest and entertainment.

### 京市若干学校成立暑期生活委员会  积极筹备暑期活动

　　京市若干学校成立暑期生活委员会
    积极筹备暑期活动
    同学们将愉快地度过暑假！
    【本报讯】暑假就要到了，京市各学校正积极进行暑期活动的准备工作。各校师生对市青年暑期生活委员会决定的今年暑假中着重进行多种多样的文化、娱乐、体育活动的基本精神都表示满意。
    若干学校已由校方、青年团、学生会等方面组成了暑期活动的领导机构，如暑期生活委员会等，帮助同学们组织起来，依据市暑委会公布的“暑期生活蓝图”订立了各种暑期活动计划。各校校方都尽力帮助同学进行暑期活动，并在暑期中照常开放图书馆、实验室等。育英中学校方愿意尽可能补助同学暑期活动的经费。很多教师热情地参加各种活动的辅导工作。
    大多数学校正在着手进行成立各种暑期的文艺、体育组织或加强原有的课外活动。据第四区十个学校的初步统计，已有歌咏、舞蹈、腰鼓等文艺组织二十三个，各种球类、技巧、游泳等体育组织二十五个。其他各区学校情形也大体相同。平民中学还组织了火棒队。各种研究组也已普遍举办或正在着手组织中。过去有基础的如育英中学少年儿童队的动物、植物标本小组（他们曾将自己的钱龙、关公蟹、小蝙蝠、守宫等标本六件作为礼品赠送苏联青年代表团）；山东中学的生物小组解剖过青蛙，崇慈女中化学小组（曾腌制过许多松花蛋等），都已准备在暑期中继续活动。研究组的内容，一般是与正课相结合，如物理、化学、生物、俄文等；另外也有其他的研究组，如崇德中学的照相研究会，女四中的时事研究会，北宁助产学校的助产和解剖小组等。
    有些同学要求在暑期中进行集体补习功课，市青年暑期生活委员会所以没有布置的原因，是考虑到：去年由于北京初解放后，同学们急待接受思想改造的政治教育，因此举办了比较集中的学习团和青年学园，进行以树立革命人生观为主的政治思想教育，是完全必要的。但今年不同，各校都已普遍进行着新民主主义教育，同学们平时学习生活已相当紧张，同学们的功课在暑假中主要应该依靠自己温习，要在一个月的短时间内集中举办也不可能满足大家不同的要求。同时通过暑期多种多样的文化娱乐活动不但使同学们能得到休息，增进健康，在思想上、文化上也能得到进步。但如男一中、辅仁男中、崇慈女中等校在不妨碍必要的休息与娱乐的原则下，请学校行政及教师协助在校内举办适当的文化补习的办法则是可行的。
