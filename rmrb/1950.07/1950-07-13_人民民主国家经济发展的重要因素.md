Important Factors in the Economic Development of People's Democratic Countries
By Laushkakoff, Translated by Jia Zongyi

The economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is based on principles completely different from those of capitalist countries. The opposition between two policies - socialist and capitalist - is particularly evident in foreign trade in economic relations.

The trade relations between capitalist countries are built on the basis of large monopolists oppressing the economies of other countries, making them suitable for the needs of large-scale imperialist rule, in order to enslave these countries and their peoples. This is the "economic cooperation" between the United States and Western European countries.

American imperialism forces Western Europe to accept the Marshall Plan, in order to dump goods in France, Britain, Italy and other Marshallized countries that cannot find a market in its own country, especially cigarettes, milk powder and flavoring items. For example, the Netherlands is a major exporter of milk, but the United States supplies milk powder according to the Marshall Plan. Many cigarette factories have already been opened in the country, but they are still being supplied with cigarettes. Western European countries receive almost no machinery from the United States, which is exactly what they urgently need. Due to the flooding of Western Europe with American goods, the industrial production of Western European countries is systematically reduced, unemployment is increasing, and the situation of the broad masses of people is drastically deteriorating. The policy of American imperialism aims to enslave Marshallized countries, stifle their national economies, and subordinate Western Europe to the United States. This imperialist policy is manifested in the fact that Wall Street monopolists, disregarding the vital interests of their Western European vassal states, prohibit them from developing trade relations with the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union.

The foreign trade relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are based on completely different principles. The treaties and agreements concluded with the governments of the brotherly republics are equal, based on respect for the interests of all countries, and guarantee that the Soviet Union will provide them with selfless assistance in the economic development and prosperity of the People's Democratic countries.

The Soviet Union supplies the People's Democratic countries with machinery and raw materials, which can best help them consolidate and develop their own industries, because industry can revitalize the national economy on the basis of new technologies.

Before the Second World War, the economic ties between Central and Southeastern Europe, and between them and the Soviet Union, were weak. For example, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia was about one percent, and the trade volume with Poland was about 0.5 percent, etc.

The reason why the trade volume with these two countries was so small can be explained by the following facts: first, there were reactionary regimes in these countries that were hostile to the Soviet Union; second, imperialist countries had a great influence on the economies of these countries.

After the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe were liberated from the fascist shackles, these countries and the Soviet Union gained an unusually wide scope in trade. In the process of liberation, the Soviet army had already given the people of these countries tremendous assistance, helping them restore transportation, urban economy, power stations, industrial enterprises, etc., and ensuring the supply of daily necessities to residents.

The Soviet Union also signed a series of short-term trade agreements with the People's Democratic countries during the war and immediately after the war. These agreements enabled the working people of the People's Democratic countries to start restoring and developing the national economy immediately after the end of the war.

An agreement signed with Poland in October 1944 guaranteed that the liberated areas of Poland would be supplied with Soviet coal, oil production, flour and other items. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, its industry was in urgent need of raw materials and various materials. At that time, the Soviet Union itself was experiencing serious post-war difficulties, but it still helped the fraternal Czech people and supplied them with fuel, cotton and other materials and raw materials. In 1945, the first post-war barter agreement was concluded between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, which played a very important role in the recovery of the Bulgarian economy. The Soviet Union imported cotton, wool, trucks, chemicals, fertilizers, metals and metal products to Bulgaria. This made it possible to replenish Bulgaria's industry, restore transportation, and ensure the supply of necessary machinery for the rural economy. The Soviet Union also supplied Bulgaria with a large amount of food. From 1945, trade relations began to develop between the Soviet Union and Romania and other People's Democratic countries.

The countries of Central and Southeastern Europe are moving towards domestic planned economy to a great extent, which has expanded the economic ties between these countries and the Soviet Union. The value of trade turnover between each other increases year by year. In 1945, the trade volume between Poland and the Soviet Union was worth 350 million rubles, while in 1948, the trade volume between the two countries increased to 1.2 billion rubles. In 1949, the trade turnover value between the Hungarian Republic and the Soviet Union increased by more than two times compared with 1948.

The Soviet Union provided great selfless assistance to the industrialization of the People's Democratic countries, because industrialization is the most important condition for building socialism.

Former Hungarian Foreign Trade Minister Ronai (now Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic) wrote in an article published in the "Szabad Nép" magazine on March 12, 1950: "If after our liberation, Soviet personnel had not come here with iron ore, coking coal, and pig iron, would it be possible to restore heavy industry? Only with the assistance of the Soviet Union can our various national economies be revived."

Strengthening and expanding the connection of foreign trade with the Soviet Union has accelerated the speed of industrialization in the People's Democratic countries.

Due to the completion of the national economic plan, various new industries have emerged in these countries. For example, in 1949, Romania's industry manufactured a large number of machine and motor models, many of which have been produced in succession. In Bulgaria, Hungary and other People's Democratic countries, many new factories and various new industries appear every year. The success achieved in the industrial development of the People's Democratic countries found a brilliant reflection at the international trade fair held in Poznan (Poland) in May this year. The major changes in the composition of trade also illustrate these successes. As early as 1947, Poland's export volume of finished products increased from 14.8 percent to 21 percent compared with 1938; Hungary's export volume increased from 25.7 percent to 40 percent; Romania's export volume increased from 2.2 percent to 15.6 percent.

The various trade agreements concluded in 1950 foresee that the mutual supply between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will be greatly increased compared with 1949. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Romania will increase by 30 percent compared with 1949, the trade volume with Bulgaria will increase by 20 percent compared with 1949, the trade volume with Poland will increase by 34 percent, and the trade volume with Hungary will increase by 20 percent.

Long-term agreements occupy a very important position in expanding trade and completing future national economic plans. They have established long-term ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, thereby guaranteeing uninterrupted trade.

In 1948, the Soviet Union and Poland signed a five-year economic agreement. This agreement stipulates the basic trade exchange volume in the stage from 1948 to 1952. It is the basis for expanding common foreign trade and a new stage in the development and consolidation of economic cooperation between the two countries. The Soviet Union has also signed long-term agreements with Czechoslovakia and other People's Democratic countries.

According to these agreements, the Soviet Union supplied Poland and Bulgaria with complete sets of equipment for new metallurgical factories - especially the metallurgical combine near Krakow, supplied Poland's cement industry and large power stations with equipment, and supplied Hungary with equipment needed for the construction of large-scale textile combines and various enterprises in other countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union provided a large amount of technical assistance in the construction of new enterprises, railways, and water conservancy projects in the People's Democratic countries.

The economy of the People's Republic of Albania has been restored and developed with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries. The Soviet Union supplied Albania's industry, railways and other equipment and raw materials, machines for the construction of rural economy, and various goods and necessities needed for the Albanian national economy. In addition to economic assistance, the Soviet Union also provided technical assistance to the construction of Albania's industrial enterprises, power stations, etc. on the basis of strengthening foreign trade ties. The industrialization of Albania can be seen from the change in the proportion of imported means of production in the country. In 1949, the import of means of production in Albania accounted for 66 percent of the total imports, while in 1938 it only accounted for 5 percent. The main supplier of Albania's means of production is the Soviet Union.

The trade with the Soviet Union plays a very important role in the ability of the working people of the People's Democratic countries to successfully complete the national economic plan.

Due to extensive trade exchanges and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the working people of the Republic of Poland completed the three-year national economic plan in two years and ten months. The people of Hungary completed their three-year plan ahead of schedule in two years and five months. Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia and other countries are all successfully implementing their national economic plans.

Now most of the working people of the People's Democratic countries have begun to implement five-year and six-year national economic development plans. The task of building the foundation of socialism depends on the national economic plan. The trade agreements they have signed with the Soviet Union bear a very important responsibility in the successful completion of these future plans by the People's Democratic countries.

The assistance of the Soviet Union, especially the supply of equipment and raw materials, will greatly help the further industrialization of the People's Democratic countries, especially the establishment and development of heavy industry.

The most important role in the development and consolidation of economic ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is the economic mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. These economic mutual assistance agreements were concluded by the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania on an equal basis. The large-scale economic mutual assistance of the Soviet Union has helped to expand trade between these countries. In the two years of 1948 and 1949, the People's Democratic countries signed long-term trade agreements with each other.

The great benefits gained from the close economic cooperation between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union have been confirmed by facts. These benefits are undeniable. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries are victoriously building the foundation of socialism.

The achievements made by the People's Democratic countries in the construction of socialism on the basis of the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union is a new devastating blow to the bourgeois nationalists and to the despicable Tito-Rankovic clique, who turned Yugoslavia into a colony of Anglo-American imperialism.

While the working people of the People's Democratic countries are feeling the beneficial effects of the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the people of Yugoslavia are enduring unimaginable poverty and suffering, and are suffering state oppression from the fascist police regime of the Tito clique every day. The despicable and dirty agents and spies of Anglo-American imperialism separated the Yugoslav people from the fraternal family of the Soviet Union and the nations that are building socialism, and placed them on the brink of destruction.

The strengthening of all aspects of ties, mutual assistance and cooperation, and the agreement of economic plans in a comradely manner between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries - all of this permanently exempts the People's Democratic countries from the consequences of the growing economic crisis in the capitalist world and the various discriminatory measures taken by imperialism against the People's Democratic countries. Relying on the great support and assistance of the Soviet Union, the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe are heading towards socialism with full confidence.

　　人民民主国家经济发展的重要因素
    劳施卡科夫著  贾宗谊译
    苏联与人民民主国家之间的经济合作，所根据的原则，与资本主义国家完全不同。在经济关系中两个政策——社会主义的与资本主义的——的对立特别明显地表现在对外贸易上。
    资本主义国家间的贸易关系是建筑在大垄断家压迫其他国家的经济的基础上，使之适合大规模的帝国主义统治的需要，以便奴役这些国家及其人民。这就是美国和西欧各国的“经济合作”。
    美国帝国主义强迫西欧接受马歇尔计划，以在法国、英国、意大利及其他马歇尔化国家倾销其在本国市场找不到销路的物品，特别是香烟、奶粉及香料物品等。譬如荷兰本是大批输出牛奶的国家，而美国却依照马歇尔计划供与奶粉。在该国已经开设了很多烟卷工厂，可是却又被供给着香烟。西欧各国差不多从美国那里得不到机器，而机器却正是它们所急切需要的。由于美货泛滥西欧，西欧各国的工业生产乃有系统削减着，失业在增涨着，广大人民群众的处境在剧烈地恶化着。美国帝国主义的政策旨在奴役马歇尔化国家，窒息其国民经济，使西欧从属于美国。这个帝国主义政策表现在华尔街垄断资本家不顾其西欧附庸国家的切身利益，禁止它们发展与人民民主国家及苏联的贸易关系这一事实上。
    苏联和人民民主国家的国外贸易关系则建筑于原则上完全不同的基础上。与兄弟共和国的政府所缔结的各种条约和协定是平等的，以尊重各国的利益为基础的，并保证在人民民主国家的经济的发展与繁荣中苏联给它们以无私的援助。
    苏联供给人民民主国家以机器与原料，那些最能帮助它们巩固与发展本国的工业，因为工业能够在新技术的基础上重新振兴国民经济。
    第二次世界大战以前，中欧与东南欧彼此之间以及它们与苏联之间的经济联系是薄弱的。例如，苏联和捷克的贸易额约为百分之一，和波兰的贸易额约为百分之点五等等。
    和这两国的贸易额之所以少得这样微不足道，在下述事实中可以得到解释：首先，从前在这些国家内存在着敌视苏联的反动政权，其次，帝国主义国家对这些国家的经济有着很大的影响。
    在中欧与东南欧国家从法西斯枷锁下解放出来以后，这些国家与苏联的贸易上获得了异常广大的范围。在解放的过程中，苏军早就已经给予这些国家的人民以巨大的援助，帮助他们恢复交通、城市经济、电力站、工业企业等，并保证供给居民以日用必需品。
    苏联还在战争的阶段以及在战争刚结束时即和人民民主国家缔订了一系列的短期贸易协定。这些协定使人民民主国家的劳动人民能在战争一结束后即开始恢复与发展国民经济。
    一九四四年十月与波兰签定了一项协定，保证了波兰解放区得到苏联煤、石油出产、面粉及其他物品的供应。捷克解放后，她的工业急需着原料及各种物资。那时苏联自己正遭历着严重的战后困难，可是还是帮助了兄弟的捷克人民，供给他们燃料、棉花及其他各种物资与原料。一九四五年保加利亚与苏联之间缔结了第一个战后易货协定，这个协定对保加利亚经济的恢复起了非常重要的作用。苏联给保加利亚输入了棉花、羊毛、卡车、化学物品、肥料、金属以及金属产品。这给予充实保加利亚的工业、恢复交通、保证农村经济所需必要的机器的供给等以可能性。苏联又供给了保加利亚大量的食粮。从一九四五年起在苏联与罗马尼亚及其他人民民主国家之间开始发展了贸易关系。
    中欧与东南欧国家在极大程度上向着国内计划经济前进着，这就扩大了这些国家和苏联的经济联系。彼此的贸易周转价值年复一年地增加着。一九四五年波兰和苏联的贸易额价值为三亿五千万卢布，而到一九四八年两国的贸易额价值则增至十二亿卢布。一九四九年匈牙利共和国与苏联的贸易周转价值比一九四八年增加两倍有余。
    苏联对人民民主国家的工业化给予了伟大的无私的援助，因为工业化是建设社会主义最重要的条件。
    前匈牙利国外贸易部长罗奈伊（现任匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席）在一九五○年三月十二日出版的《沙巴德·涅普》杂志上所发表的一篇文章中写道：“假如在我国解放后没有苏联的人员带着铁矿、焦煤、生铁来到这里，恢复重工业可能吗？只有在苏联的援助下，才能复兴我们的各种国民经济。”
    加强并扩大与苏联的国外贸易的连系，加快了人民民主国家工业化的速度。
    由于完成了国民经济计划，在这些国家里出现了各种新的工业。例如，在一九四九年罗马尼亚的工业就制造出了大批的机器与联动机模型，其中有很多种已经陆续出产了。在保加利亚、匈牙利及其他人民民主国家中每年都有许多新的工厂与各种新的工业出现。人民民主国家工业的发展上所获得的成功在今年五月间在波兹南（波兰）所举行的国际贸易上找到了辉煌的反映。贸易构成分的重大改变也说明了这些成功。还在一九四七年时波兰的成品出口额与一九三八年比较即从百分之十四点八增加到二十一；匈牙利的出口额从百分之二十五点七增加到四十；罗马尼亚的出口额从百分之二点二增加到十五点六。
    一九五○年缔结的各种贸易协定预见到苏联与人民民主国家之间彼此的供应将比一九四九年大大地增加。苏联与罗马尼亚的贸易额将比一九四九年增加百分之三十，与保加利亚的贸易额将比一九四九年增加百分之二十，与波兰的贸易额将增加百分之三十四，与匈牙利的贸易额将增加百分之二十。
    长期协定在扩展贸易与完成未来的国民经济计划上占了一个非常重要的位置。它们在苏联与人民民主国家之间建立了长久的连系，从而保证了不间断的贸易。
    一九四八年苏联与波兰缔订了五年经济协定。这个协定规定了在一九四八年至一九五二年这一阶段的基本的贸易交换额，它是扩大共同对外贸易的基础，同时也是发展与巩固两国经济合作的新阶段。苏联和捷克及其他人民民主国家也签订了长期协定。
    根据这些协定，苏联供给了波兰与保加利亚的新冶金工厂——特别是克拉科附近的冶金康拜因以整套的设备，供给波兰的水泥工业与大电力站以设备，供给了匈牙利建设大规模的纺织康拜因及其他国家各种企业所需要的设备。与此同时，苏联在人民民主国家建设新的企业、铁路、水利建筑中给予了大量的技术上的援助。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的经济在苏联及其他人民民主国家的大力援助下恢复并发展了。苏联供给了阿尔巴尼亚工业、铁路及其他设备与原料、建设农村经济的机器和各种为阿尔巴尼亚国民经济所需要的货物、必需品。除了经济的援助以外，苏联并在加强对外贸易的连系的基础上对阿尔巴尼亚的工业企业、电力站以及其他等等的建设给予了技术上的援助。关于阿尔巴尼亚的工业化从该国生产工具输入的比重的变化上便可看出。一九四九年阿尔巴尼亚的生产工具的输入在进口总额中占百分之六十六，而在一九三八年则仅占百分之五。阿尔巴尼亚的生产工具的主要供给者便是苏联。
    人民民主国家的劳动人民之所以能够胜利地完成国民经济计划，其中起非常重大作用的是与苏联的贸易。
    由于广泛的贸易交流与苏联无私的援助，波兰共和国的劳动人民两年另十个月就完成了三年国民经济计划。匈牙利的人民两年另五个月便提前完成了自己的三年计划。阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、捷克等国都正在成功地实现着国民经济计划。
    现在人民民主国家绝大部分的劳动人民都已经开始实施着五年与六年的国民经济发展计划。而建设社会主义基础的任务正是依赖于国民经济计划。人民民主国家在成功地完成这些将来的计划中，它们与苏联订立的贸易协定负了很重要的责任。
    苏联的援助，特别是设备与原料的供应，将大有助于人民民主国家进一步的工业化，首先是重工业的建立与发展。
    在发展与巩固苏联与人民民主国家之间的经济连系上，发生最大作用的是与苏联的经济互助，这些经济互助乃是苏联、波兰、捷克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚与阿尔巴尼亚等国的政府在平等的基础上订立的。苏联的大规模的经济互助协助扩大了这些国家之间的贸易。一九四八年与一九四九年两年中人民民主国家彼此之间缔订了长期贸易协定。
    人民民主国家与苏联在经济上亲密合作所获得的巨大利益已为事实所证实。这些利益是无可争辩的。人民民主国家在苏联的援助之下正在胜利地建立着社会主义的基础。
    人民民主国家由于苏联兄弟般的援助而在社会主义基础的建设中所达到的成就，对于资产阶级的民族主义者们，对于把南斯拉夫变为英美帝国主义殖民地的卑鄙的铁托——兰科维奇集团，是一个新的毁灭性的打击。
    在人民民主国家的劳动人民感受着苏联无私的援助的有益影响之同时，南斯拉夫的人民却正忍受着不可想像的贫穷困苦，每日遭受着来自铁托集团的法西斯蒂警察政权的国家方面的压迫。卑鄙龌龊的英美帝国主义的代理人与间谍把南斯拉夫人民从苏联与正在建设社会主义的兄弟般的民族大家庭中分裂出去而置之于毁灭的边缘。
    苏联与人民民主国家之间各方面的连系的加强、互助合作、同志般的经济计划方面的一致——这一切使人民民主国家永远免除了正在增长中的资本主义世界的经济危机的后果以及帝国主义为反对人民民主国家所进行的各式各样的歧视的措施。依靠着苏联的伟大的支持与援助，中欧与东南欧国家正在满怀信心地走向社会主义。
