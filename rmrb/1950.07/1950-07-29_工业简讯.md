	State-Run Jilin Paper Mill Completes Half-Yearly Task Ahead of Schedule

	The State-Run Jilin Paper Mill, during the unfolding campaign of embracing the Party through production, completed its first half-year production task ahead of schedule on June 23rd. This is mainly the result of the leading cadres' initial implementation of the policy of relying on the masses.

	Improved Tools and Operations - Tianjin No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory Increases Production

	In the June production competition, Tianjin No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory exceeded the original plan by 38%, saving 9,700 workdays. The quality also improved compared to May. For example, the scrap rate of the third workshop has decreased from 3.4% to 3.26%. As a result of utilizing waste materials, a total of 52 million yuan was saved in June. In leading the production competition, the tendency of simply pursuing quantity and increasing labor intensity was corrected, and the emphasis was placed on improving tools and operation methods. For example, the bobbin workshop changed the original twenty woodworking procedures to fourteen, while improving the quantity and quality of the products. Ding Deyuan and Wang Wenrong, fitters of the second workshop, created a mobile drilling machine, which not only increased work efficiency by 3.3 times, but also eliminated the difficulty of moving back and forth.

	Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Factory's Water Pump Team Completes Second Quarter Production One Month Ahead of Schedule

	The Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Factory's water pump team originally planned to repair ten wastewater pumps in the second quarter, but completed the task one month ahead of schedule by the end of May. During the repair work, the team created three tools and utilized some waste materials that were previously considered unusable, saving the state a considerable amount of resources.

	Beijing Locomotive Depot Emphasizes Security - Beijing Public Works Depot Exhibits Complacency

	The Beijing Locomotive Depot holds weekly discussions on security issues, conducts a fire drill once a week, and has firefighters share their experiences in order to strengthen security work. Due to the importance attached by the leading cadres, the security equipment is also very complete. Conversely, the Beijing Public Works Depot exhibits a complacent attitude towards security work. For example, at 12:30 am on May 11, all duty personnel of the depot's worker patrol team were asleep, neglecting their patrol duties. They also did not pay enough attention to fire drills, lacking prior planning and failing to take the drills seriously. This should be corrected in the future.

	Taiyuan Building Materials Factory's Trade Union Successfully Leads Production

	The Taiyuan Building Materials Factory's trade union has been fully promoting production, and in the May contracted production task of 43,100 square timbers for the Railway Bureau, it generally improved production efficiency. After the administration set the plan, the trade union conducted discussions through the workers' representative meeting and trade union groups, launching a mass movement to set plans. At the same time, it called on everyone to cherish tools and strive to prevent machine malfunctions to ensure production. The trade union used blackboards to commend and publicize new production achievements and methods at any time, thereby encouraging everyone's production enthusiasm and exchanging experiences in a timely manner, which increased the production efficiency of the factory's twelve saws from the original 200 pieces per hour to 350 pieces, creating a new record in the factory's history.

    国营吉林造纸厂提前完成半年任务
    国营吉林造纸厂在展开拥党生产大竞赛中，于六月二十三日，提前完成了上半年的生产任务。这主要是领导干部初步贯彻了依靠群众的方针的结果。

    改进工具和操作法  津中纺机械厂提高生产
    天津中纺机械厂在六月份的生产竞赛中，生产超过原定计划百分之三十八，省工九千七百个；质量也比五月份提高了。如第三工场报废率已由百分之三点四，降至百分之三点二六。由于利用废料的结果，六月份共节省五千二百万元。在生产竞赛的领导上，纠正了单纯追逐数量和提高劳动强度的偏向，着重了改进工具和操作方法。如梭管场将原来木工方面的二十道手续改为十四道，同时提高了产品的数量和质量；第二工场钳工部丁德元、王文荣创造了活动钻眼机，不但使工作效率提高了三点三倍，而且省去了来回搬移的困难。

    北京机务段重视保安  工务段存有麻痹现象
    北京机务段为加强保安工作，每周研讨保安问题一次，作一次消防突击演习，并由消防班人员介绍经验。由于领导干部的重视，保安设备亦甚完备。相反地，北京工务段却存有不重视保安工作的麻痹现象。如五月十一日夜十二时半，该段工人纠察队值勤人员竟全部入睡，不管巡查工作；对消防演习亦不够重视，事前没有计划，演习时亦不认真。今后应加纠正。
