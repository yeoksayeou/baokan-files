　　Severely Punish Counter-Revolutionaries
    In order to carry out various sabotage activities in mainland China, imperialists and remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs have recently been constantly sending special agents and spies from Taiwan and other places to infiltrate mainland China. In the newly liberated areas, there are still about 400,000 bandits scattered in various remote places. After the Kuomintang bandit gangs' army was basically eliminated on the mainland, this has become their main way of carrying out desperate struggles against the Chinese people. Therefore, Chairman Mao, in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC, listed "resolutely eliminating all bandits, secret agents, despots, and other counter-revolutionaries who endanger the people" as one of the eight tasks that must be done well, and called on "the whole Party and the people of the whole country to be vigilant against the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries." The instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities issued today by the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court also clearly point out that resolutely eliminating counter-revolutionaries and rapidly establishing and consolidating revolutionary order are one of the primary tasks of people's governments at all levels.
    The correct policy for suppressing counter-revolutionaries is "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not to be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." These three principles are indispensable. However, some places are excessively lenient towards counter-revolutionaries, to the point that some masses say: "We fear neither heaven nor earth, but we fear the Communist Party talking about leniency." This is criticism of some of our cadres for neglecting the principle of "the ringleaders must be punished." As long as it is truly proven that they are ringleaders, they must be sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment in accordance with the law. Failing to do so will not achieve the purpose of educating and uniting the masses and isolating counter-revolutionaries, and may even give encouragement to resolute counter-revolutionaries.
    Some cadres also interpret "the coerced are not to be questioned" as "not bothering" with coerced counter-revolutionaries, which is also wrong. "Not questioning" means "not being held accountable" and "no punishment for past offenses," but it does not mean adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards coerced counter-revolutionaries. For those who are coerced, we must patiently carry out education and transformation work, and strive as much as possible to get them to assist in the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries. It must be remembered that Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates, "For ordinary reactionaries... after disarming them and eliminating their special forces, it is still necessary to deprive them of their political rights within a necessary period according to law, but at the same time provide them with a way out for life, and force them to transform themselves through labor and become new people. If they continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely punished."
    For "those who perform meritorious service," they must also be treated differently. "Those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded" mainly refers to those who voluntarily perform meritorious service before the bandits are completely wiped out and the special agents are arrested, and rewards should be given according to the size of their merits. Those who perform meritorious service after being captured or exposed should also be given considerable rewards, but there should be some distinction from the former. It is wrong not to reward those who have performed meritorious service, and excessive or inappropriate rewards are also wrong.
    On the other hand, it must be recognized that "resolute and merciless suppression" is only for resolute and important counter-revolutionaries, and it must go through certain procedures and must not become an excuse for random arrests, beatings, and killings. The instructions of the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court have already stipulated strict approval procedures for counter-revolutionary cases, and pointed out that "evidence should be thoroughly investigated, the case should be carefully studied, and torture to extract confessions is prohibited" when handling these counter-revolutionary cases. In order to ensure that the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries can proceed smoothly and orderly and avoid unnecessary errors, these regulations are completely necessary. All levels of staff responsible for suppressing counter-revolutionaries should conscientiously and earnestly implement these instructions. The work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries is an intense, sharp, and tense struggle, and it is also a meticulous, complex, and long-term struggle. We must not be paralyzed, slack, indulgent, or hasty in our work.
    Counter-revolutionaries take advantage of the weaknesses in our work and among our cadres to carry out activities. In order to effectively suppress counter-revolutionary activities, we must also earnestly correct the shortcomings in our work and style. Where cadres are divorced from the masses, are corrupt and degenerate, there the doors are opened for special agents and bandits. Even the slightest mistake in work can be exploited by counter-revolutionaries. As long as we closely unite the masses, rely on the masses, and constantly raise the political consciousness of the masses, and improve our work, counter-revolutionaries will have no place to stand.
    The People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Organs, Public Security Forces, working together with the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas, have basically eliminated the armed insurgent bandits in many areas and have uncovered many lurking and hidden special agent organizations. Since the army crossed the river in April last year alone, nearly a million bandits have been eliminated. In Beijing alone, since liberation, more than 170 major cases of special agent sabotage activities have been uncovered, nearly a thousand special agents have been arrested, more than two thousand special agents have been concentrated for management and training, and more than three thousand people have registered for a new start. In June last year, a huge American spy case was uncovered in Shenyang. This shows that the Chinese people have the full power to eliminate all the open and hidden counter-revolutionaries fostered and directed by American imperialism. If counter-revolutionaries do not take the path of a new start, they will only go to their deaths.

### 严惩反革命分子

专栏：短评

　　严惩反革命分子
    帝国主义者和国民党残余匪帮为了在我国大陆上进行各种破坏活动，近来不断派遣特务、间谍分子从台湾等地潜入我国大陆。在新解放区还有约四十万土匪分散在各个偏僻地方。国民党匪帮的军队在大陆上被基本消灭之后，这已成为他们进行绝望挣扎反对中国人民的主要方式。所以毛主席在中共三中全会的报告中把“坚决地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子”列为必须作好的八项工作之一，并号召“全党和全国人民对于反革命分子的阴谋活动，必须提高警惕性”。今天发表的政务院和最高人民法院关于镇压反革命活动的指示也明确指出：坚决肃清反革命分子、迅速建立与巩固革命秩序是各级人民政府当前的首要任务之一。
    镇压反革命分子的正确政策是“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”，这三条政策不可缺一。但有的地方对反革命分子却过分宽大了，以至有的群众说：“天不怕，地不怕，就怕共产党讲宽大。”这就是批评我们某些干部偏废了“首恶者必办”这一条。只要确实证明了是首恶分子，就必须依法处以死刑或长期徒刑。不如此，就不能达到教育与团结群众、孤立反革命分子的目的，甚至会给坚决的反革命分子以一种鼓励。
    还有些干部把“胁从者不问”解释为对胁从的反革命分子“不过问”，这也是错误的。“不问”是“不问罪”与“既往不咎”的意思，而不是对胁从的反革命分子采取放任态度的意思。对于胁从者，必须耐心地进行教育改造的工作，并尽可能地争取他们协助进行肃清反革命分子的工作。必须记住，人民政协共同纲领第七条中规定，“对一般的反动分子……，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利，但同时给以生活出路，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁。”
    对于“立功者”也要分别对待。“立功者受奖”，主要是指土匪未就歼与特务未就逮之先自动立功者，应按其功劳大小分别给予奖励；对于被俘或被破获后立功者也要有相当的奖励，但要与前者有所区别。对有功者毫无奖励是不对的，过分的不适当的奖励也是不对的。
    另一方面，必须认清“坚决无情的镇压”，只是对待坚决的重要的反革命分子的，而且必须经过一定的手续，决不能成为乱抓乱打乱杀的借口。政务院和最高人民法院的指示中已经规定了对反革命案件的严格的批准手续，而且指出处理这些反革命案件时“均应切实调查证据，认真研究案情，并禁止刑讯逼供”。为了使肃清反革命分子的工作能够顺利地有秩序地进行并避免不应有的错误，这些规定是完全必要的。负责镇压反革命分子的各级工作人员，应该切实认真执行这个指示。肃清反革命分子的工作是激烈尖锐紧张的斗争，同时也是细致复杂长期的斗争。不能麻痹松懈、放纵姑息，也不能简单从事，操之过急。
    反革命分子是利用我们工作中和干部中的弱点进行活动的。为了有效地镇压反革命活动，也必须认真地纠正我们工作中和作风上的缺点。那里的干部脱离群众、贪污腐化，那里就为特务、土匪打开了大门；工作上稍有错误，也就会被反革命分子钻隙而入。只要我们紧紧地团结群众，依靠群众，不断提高群众的政治觉悟，改进我们的工作，反革命分子就没有立足容身之处。
    人民解放军和人民公安机关、公安部队，与广大城乡人民同心协力，已经在许多地区基本上肃清了武装暴乱的土匪，破获了许多潜伏隐藏的特务组织。只是去年四月大军渡江后到现在，就已消灭了土匪近百万。只是北京一地，解放以来就已破获了较重大的特务破坏活动案件一百七十多起，逮捕特务分子近千名，集中管训特务二千多名，另有登记自新分子三千多名。去年六月并在沈阳破获了巨大的美国间谍案。这说明了中国人民有充分力量消灭美帝国主义豢养指使的一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子。反革命分子如不走自新之路，就只有走向死亡。
