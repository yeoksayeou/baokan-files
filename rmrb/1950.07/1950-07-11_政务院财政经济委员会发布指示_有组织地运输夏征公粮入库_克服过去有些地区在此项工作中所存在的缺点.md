Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee issued instructions on the 7th to the Greater Administrative Regions and the People's Governments of provinces and municipalities directly under the Government Administration Council, as well as their affiliated Finance Departments (Bureaus) and Grain Bureaus, regarding the organization of the summer grain tax transportation and warehousing. The full text is as follows:

This year's summer grain tax is about to be concentrated and stored in warehouses. In order to overcome the shortcomings that existed in some areas in the work of transporting and warehousing public grain in the past, such as vehicle and boat congestion, and livestock and human injuries and deaths due to poor arrangements, and to achieve organized and planned transportation and warehousing, the following opinions are put forward for reference and implementation in various places.

I. All localities should establish public grain collection and storage committees at the district and county levels and below, based on the tax rates and methods for summer grain tax as instructed by the Government Administration Council, and with reference to the grain quantity distributed by the higher authorities and the subsequent plans for grain disbursement and transfer. The committee shall be headed by the administrative head and composed of relevant departments such as finance, grain, public security, armed forces, and grain companies. The work of the committee is to delineate the areas and quantities of public grain to be received by each warehouse, based on the distribution and capacity of the financial and trade warehouses in the special district, county, and district, and to determine the dates and order of grain delivery by the people, so as to achieve organized and planned delivery and avoid congestion and confusion.

II. All localities should conduct a general inspection of warehouses and repair them before the grain is stored to prevent insect, rodent, and mildew damage. Use wheat and rice husks to line the bottoms and tops to prevent looting, fire, and theft.

III. According to the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Unified Management of National Public Grain Revenue, Expenditure, Storage, and Transfer," national public grain and local public grain should be stored separately. Those who have not separated the storage in the past should strive to separate the storage from this year's summer conscription and keep separate accounts. If it is temporarily impossible to separate the storage, it is still temporarily allowed to merge into one warehouse, but separate accounts must be kept. Different grains should be stored in different warehouses.

IV. Strengthen the efficiency of grain receiving work, scientifically divide labor, improve weighing and measuring techniques, and strive to complete the cleaning of the grain delivered on the same day.

V. According to the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Unified Management of National Public Grain Revenue, Expenditure, Storage, and Transfer," taxpayers are obliged to transport public grain within 100 li (approximately 50 kilometers). If the distance exceeds the prescribed mileage, wages shall be paid according to the local average freight rate. All transportation expenses, except for cash payments in grain-deficient areas, shall be paid in grain in other areas, but a budget must be submitted in advance and expenditure can only be made after permission is granted.

VI. Organize the masses to sell water and food along the transportation routes and lend houses to solve the food and accommodation difficulties of the grain-transporting masses. To prevent livestock and human injuries and deaths, grain depots receiving more than 2 million jin of grain (1.5 million jin in mountainous areas) should prepare emergency medicines; in areas with animal-powered transportation, veterinarians and rest areas for livestock and people should also be prepared. The expenses for medicines and veterinarians are stipulated to be reimbursed from the grain affairs expenses within the range of 0.05% of the total amount of grain received by the warehouse after the budget is approved. In case of injury or death of livestock or people, or damage to vehicles or boats due to the transportation of public grain, compensation shall be given within the principle of not exceeding one-half of the original value, and the collection and storage committee or the finance and grain department at all levels shall report to the government at the same level and then to the central Ministry of Finance or the Financial and Economic Committee of the Greater Administrative Region or the Ministry of Finance for approval and reimbursement.

　　政务院财政经济委员会发布指示
    有组织地运输夏征公粮入库
    克服过去有些地区在此项工作中所存在的缺点
    【新华社十日讯】政务院财政经济委员会于七日向各大行政区及政务院直属省、市人民政府及所属财政部（厅）、粮食局发布关于组织夏征公粮运输入库工作的指示，全文如下：
    本年夏征公粮，即将集中入库，为克服过去有些地区在公粮运输入库工作中所存在的缺点，如因布置不善而造成车船拥挤、人畜疾病伤亡等现象，作到有组织有计划地运输入库，特提出如下意见，请各地参照执行。
    一、各地应根据政务院所指示的夏征公粮的税率和办法，并参照上级分配的征粮数量和以后粮食支拨调度的计划，在专区、县级以下成立公粮征收屯集委员会，由行政首长负责，由财政、粮食、公安、武装、粮食公司等有关部门参加组成。委员会的工作是根据本专、县、区财政和贸易仓库的分布状况和容量大小，划定各仓库接收公粮的地区和接收的数量，决定人民交粮的日期和交粮的次序，作到有组织有计划地接交，避免拥挤混乱。
    二、各地应普遍进行一次检查仓库的工作，在粮食未入库前进行修补，预防虫鼠霉烂，利用麦谷糠秕、铺底扇顶，防抢、防火、防偷。
    三、根据政务院《关于统一国家公粮收支保管调度的决定》，国家公粮与地方公粮应分开入库。凡过去未分开入库者，争取从今年夏征起分开入库，分开记账。如暂时不可能分开入库者，仍暂准合并一库，但须分开记账。不同粮食要分别归入不同仓库。
    四、加强接收粮食的工作效率，科学分工，提高过磅过秤技术，争取当日来粮当日清理完毕。
    五、依照政务院《关于统一国家公粮收支保管调度的决定》，运送公粮往返在一百华里以内者，由纳税人义务输送，超过规定里程者，则按当地普通运费发给工资。所有运费开支，除缺粮地区发给现款外，其他地区一律发给粮食，但须事先报送预算，经许可后始得开支。
    六、应组织群众沿运输路线卖水，卖饭，出借房屋，解决运粮群众的食宿困难。为防止人畜疾病伤亡，凡接收粮食在二百万斤以上（山区一五○万斤以上）的粮库，应准备救急药品；有畜力运输地区，还应准备兽医和组织人畜休憩处；所需药品和兽医的开支，规定在该仓库收粮总额千分之零点五的范围内经预算批准之粮务费项下实报实销。因运输公粮而致人畜伤亡或车船损坏者，在不超过原值二分之一原则下予以赔偿，由各级征收屯集委员会或财粮部门报请同级政府层报中央财政部或大行政区财政经济委员会或财政部核准报销。
