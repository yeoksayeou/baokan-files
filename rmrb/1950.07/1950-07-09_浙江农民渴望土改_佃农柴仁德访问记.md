　　Zhejiang Peasants Yearn for Land Reform
    Interview with Tenant Farmer Chai Rende
    Chai Rende is from Dagushan Village, Yaojiang District, Zhuji, Zhejiang Province, and is 51 years old this year. His family has nine members, living in a dilapidated thatched cottage, renting eight mu of land. The whole family only has one tattered mosquito net and one old cotton quilt. They haven't bought any new clothes in ten years. Half of the thatched house is a living space, and half is a kitchen. The pigsty and goose house are next to the stove. The family usually eats rice porridge and bran cakes, with Rende only having a few meals of dry rice during the busy farming season.
    Chai Rende's whole family is hardworking. In addition to farming, Rende also slaughters pigs, makes wine, and saws planks. His wife feeds pigs and raises silkworms. His children look after geese, cut pig grass, and pick tea leaves. There is no idle person. In the past, in good years, the eight mu of land they rented could yield 2,000 catties of grain a year. A sow could give birth to two litters of piglets a year, equivalent to about 2,000 catties of grain. Raising silkworms, picking tea, and raising geese could bring in a total of 1,000 catties. The family's total annual income was over 5,000 catties of grain. But the family's life was still so poor. Chai Rende said: "We don't own any land, and we have to farm the landlord's land. In good years, we can manage to get a little grain to eat, but in bad years, we lose money. The suffering lies in not owning land. Regardless of whether the year is good or bad, we have to pay rent to the landlord. It would be good to have a few mu of land." Later, Chai Rende heard that land reform would be implemented in the second half of this year. He said happily: "With land reform, we will have our own land and won't have to pay rent to the landlord. With my strength, I can support the whole family. Last year, the People's Government led us to reduce rent, and this year they are leading us to distribute land and overthrow the landlords. From now on, the peasants can stand up."

　　浙江农民渴望土改
    佃农柴仁德访问记
    柴仁德是浙江诸暨姚江区大孤山村人，今年五十一岁。家有九口人，一间破草屋，租种八亩田。一家人仅有一个破帐子，一条旧棉被，十年没添过一件衣服。草房里半间是住房，半间是厨房。猪厩，鹅厩都在灶旁。家里人平常吃米粥糠饼度日，只有仁德在农忙时吃几餐干饭。
    柴仁德全家都好劳动。仁德除种田外，还会杀猪、做酒、锯板。他妻子喂猪、养蚕。子女们看鹅、割猪草、采茶叶。没有一个闲人。过去在好年景，他们所租种的八亩田一年可收入谷子二千斤。一个母猪一年生两窝小猪，折合谷子约可收入二千斤。养蚕、采茶、养鹅等共可收入一千斤。全家每年总收入在五千斤谷子以上。但是一家人的生活还是这样穷苦。柴仁德说：“自家没有田，要种地主的田，年成好还能弄着几颗谷吃，年成不好就赔本。苦就苦在没有田，不管年成好歹，要给地主缴租谷。要有几亩田就好了。”后来柴仁德听说今年下半年要实行土地改革了。他高兴地说：“土地改革，自己有了田，不用给地主缴租，就凭我的老劲也能养活了全家。去年人民政府领导我们减租，今年又领导我们分田地，打倒地主，以后农民可就翻身了。”
