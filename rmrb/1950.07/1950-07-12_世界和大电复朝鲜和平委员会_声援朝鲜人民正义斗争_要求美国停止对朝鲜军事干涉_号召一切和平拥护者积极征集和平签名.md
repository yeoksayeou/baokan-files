　　Xinhua News Agency, 11th: TASS, Paris, 9th: The Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has issued a reply to the telegram from the Korean National Peace Committee. The reply states: The Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress affirms: 1. The Government of the United States of America is responsible for its armed intervention in Korea with land, sea, and air forces; 2. The US Air Force is wantonly bombing Korean civilians; 3. The governments of the United States and other countries, in order to justify this intervention, have violated the United Nations Charter, which is based on the principle of unanimity among the five great powers, and these actions have seriously damaged the prestige of the United Nations; 4. These governments have clearly violated the principles of the United Nations Charter, according to which the United Nations must listen to the opinions of the Korean People's Government before passing any resolutions; 5. Furthermore, the Government of the United States of America has decided to send its fleet to Taiwan, strengthen its troops stationed in the Philippines, and send a military mission to Indochina, which constitutes interference in the internal affairs of the peoples of the other three Asian countries.
    The Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress expresses its warm sympathy and support to the Korean people who are realizing their national unity in the struggle against foreign intervention.
    The secretariat demands that the United States cease its military intervention in Korea and allow the Korean people to be masters of their own destiny, in order to achieve unification, freedom and independence.
    The secretariat calls on all peace advocates in all countries of the world to more actively collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal, which is increasingly becoming the main method of easing international tensions and winning peace.

　　世界和大电复朝鲜和平委员会
    声援朝鲜人民正义斗争
    要求美国停止对朝鲜军事干涉
    号召一切和平拥护者积极征集和平签名
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎九日讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会秘书处发表了对朝鲜拥护和平全国委员会来电的复文。复文称：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会秘书处确认：一、美利坚合众国政府已因其以陆、海、空军在朝鲜实行武装干涉而负责；二、美国空军大肆轰炸朝鲜平民；三、美国政府及其他国家的政府，为辩解这次干涉，已经破坏了以五强一致原则为基础的联合国宪章，这些行动已严重地损害了联合国的威信；四、这些政府已经明白地破坏了联合国宪章的原则，根据这个原则，联合国在通过任何决定之前，必须听取朝鲜人民政府的意见；五、此外，美利坚合众国政府已决定派遣其舰队至台湾，加强其驻菲律宾的军队并派遣军事使团至印度支那，这就是干涉亚洲其他三国人民的内政。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会秘书处热烈同情并声援正在反对外国干涉的斗争中实现其全国统一的朝鲜人民。
    秘书处要求美国停止对朝鲜的军事干涉，让朝鲜人民成为自己命运的主人，以获得统一、自由与独立。
    秘书处号召全世界一切国家的一切和平拥护者更加积极地为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名，这已日益成为和缓国际紧张情势以及赢得和平的主要方法。
