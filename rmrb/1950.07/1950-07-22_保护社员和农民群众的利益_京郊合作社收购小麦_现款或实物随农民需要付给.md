　　Protecting the Interests of Cooperative Members and Farmers
    Beijing Suburbs Cooperatives Purchase Wheat
    Payment in Cash or Kind Provided According to Farmers' Needs
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to protect the interests of cooperative members, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters has decided to purchase another two million jin of wheat with cash. On June 27th, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters convened responsible cadres from suburban branch cooperatives to deploy this work, especially pointing out: In this work, attention should be paid to listening to the opinions of the masses, closely connecting with the masses, taking care of the interests of the masses, and paying attention to the quality of wheat. Now the eight suburban branch cooperatives have started the purchasing work according to the instructions of the headquarters. In order to take care of the needs and convenience of cooperative members and the masses, payment in cash or in kind (coarse grains, general merchandise, oil, salt, etc.) is optional when selling wheat. The price for cooperative members is the same as the price for non-members, but cooperative members have priority. Farmers in Dongyingfang Village in the northern suburbs said: "Before liberation, wheat was worthless every time after the wheat harvest. One jin of wheat couldn't even be exchanged for one jin of corn. When we needed money, we had no choice but to sell it. This year, the cooperative is purchasing it, and one jin of wheat can be exchanged for one and a half jin of Northeast corn. The People's Government and the cooperative are really concerned about our interests!"

　　保护社员和农民群众的利益
    京郊合作社收购小麦   
    现款或实物随农民需要付给
    【本报讯】为了保护社员利益，北京市供销合作总社顷决定再以现款收购小麦二百万斤。六月二十七日，供销总社召集郊区各分社负责干部布置这一工作时特别指出：在这工作中要注意听取群众的意见，密切联系群众，要照顾群众利益，并要注意麦子的质量。现在八个郊区分社已按照总社指示开始了收购工作。为了照顾社员、群众的需要与方便起见，售麦时要钱或要实物（粗粮、百货、油盐等）听便。社员价与非社员买卖价格相同，但社员有优先权。北郊东营房村的农民说：“在解放前，每到麦收后，麦子便不值钱，一斤麦子还换不了一斤玉米，等着用钱，不卖又不行。今年合作社收购，一斤麦子可以换一斤五两东北玉米，人民政府与合作社真关心咱们的利益！”
