Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Pleven, a well-known supporter of de Gaulle from the Democratic and Social Union of Resistance, has formed a new cabinet. Disregarding the opposition of the broad masses of the people and the demand for the establishment of a democratic coalition government, the majority faction in the French National Assembly, as agents of the bourgeoisie, passed the Pleven cabinet on the 13th with 335 votes to 226. Since the fall of the Bidault cabinet on June 24, the French government crisis has continued for about twenty days. In addition to the Popular Republican Movement, the Radical Socialist Party, the Democratic and Social Union of Resistance, and the non-partisan "Independent Republican Group," the Socialist Party, which has been acting as a "moderate opposition" for the past six months, also participated in the new Pleven government. Right-wing socialists, led by Secretary-General Mollet, shamelessly supported and praised this new government, composed of loyal servants of American warmongers, which is stepping up war preparations and selling out national interests. Communist deputies expressed their firm opposition during the vote of confidence in the National Assembly and exposed Pleven's reactionary features.

    法国普利文组成新阁
    法共议员揭露普利文反动面目
    【新华社十六日讯】著名的戴高乐支持者民主社会抵抗同盟的普利文已组成内阁。作为资产阶级代理人的法国国民议会中的多数派，不顾广大人民的反对和建立民主联合政府的要求，在十三日以三三五票对二二六票通过了普利文内阁。自皮杜尔内阁在六月二十四日倒台以来，法国政府危机曾继续了约二十天。参加此次普利文政府的，除人民共和党、激进社会党、民主社会抵抗同盟以及无党派的“独立共和集团”外，而且还有六个月来一直充当“温和反对派”的社会党。以总书记摩勒为首的右翼社会党人无耻地支持并赞扬这一加紧备战和出卖民族利益的为美国战争贩子忠实仆从们所组成的新政府。共产党议员在国民议会举行信任投票时，曾表示了坚决的反对，并揭露了普利文的反动面目。
