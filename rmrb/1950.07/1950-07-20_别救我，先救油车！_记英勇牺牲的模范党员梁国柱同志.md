　　"Don't Save Me, Save the Oil Truck First!"
    ——Remembering Model Party Member Liang Guozhu, Who Died Heroically
    Comrade Liang Guozhu worked as a transfer worker at an oil depot at a certain station. He treated the oil depot as his own home, paying meticulous attention to its safety. Because he often saw trains coming to the oil depot spitting out sparks nearby, he suggested to his superiors, "In the future, when the train comes, hang a few empty carriages in front of the locomotive, so that the sparks from the locomotive can be further away from the oil depot, which can prevent fires." Other workers were happy to go out to see plays and movies on holidays, but Comrade Liang Guozhu was afraid that the oil depot would be unguarded and accidents would happen, so he guarded the oil depot alone.
    On March 21st of this year, he and eight workers were responsible for transferring a train of oil. After the transfer was completed, they divided the work to clean up the oil pump. Because they were afraid that the oil remaining in the machine would be lost, Comrade Liang Guozhu prepared to pump it all out. At that time, he was holding an oil drum, facing the oil pump outlet to receive the oil. He asked worker Ren Denzhang to turn on the electric switch. But because Ren Denzhang's skills were not skilled enough, he pushed it slowly, and the electric switch sparked; at this time, the oil pump was connected to the current, and the remaining oil was suddenly pushed out, splashing Comrade Liang Guozhu all over. Because the wind was strong that day, it blew the splashed oil droplets and sparks together, causing them to burn. The clothes on Comrade Liang Guozhu's body and the oil drum in his hand also started to burn. The flames spewing from the oil drum were five or six meters high. Seeing this tense situation, Comrade Liang Guozhu thought: If such a fire spreads to the train full of gasoline, it will definitely cause an explosive fire. So he ran away with the burning oil drum, regardless of everything. When the workers saw him running with the burning oil drum in his hand, and the clothes on his body were also burning, burning into a ball of fire, everyone wanted to come up and save him, but he said, "Don't worry about me, quickly save the fire next to the train!" He ran fifty meters away before throwing away the burning bucket in his hand. At this time, his hands had been burned, and the fire on his clothes was burning more and more fiercely, and he fainted to the ground.
    The workers concentrated all their efforts and extinguished the raging fire next to the train in five or six minutes. When they turned back to save Comrade Liang Guozhu, he had been burned beyond recognition by the raging fire. Everyone hurriedly tore off his burning clothes. In his coma, he struggled and shouted, "Don't save me, save the oil truck first! Don't save me, save the oil truck! That's the people's oil truck!..." Because of this, he saved the oil in sixteen oil trucks and the station's oil depot.
    The workers quickly carried Comrade Liang Guozhu to the car and sent him to the hospital. After the doctor's examination, he believed that his injuries were too severe and it was difficult to save him. But the doctors still had unlimited hope for this loyal son of the glorious working people—Comrade Liang Guozhu, and wanted to make this hero continue to live and do more work for the people. They did not hesitate to inject medicine again and again to save this hero. Finally, they managed to make Comrade Liang Guozhu wake up a little. Everyone was very excited about this. In the evening, the workers rushed to see him. In his semi-comatose state, he still asked if the fire had been put out. He smiled and said, "It doesn't matter if I die alone, it's okay if I save the public oil truck!" He added emphatically, and told everyone: "In the future, you must be especially careful when you work, and you can't be careless anymore. This is very dangerous."
    On the same night, Comrade Liang Guozhu, an excellent Communist Party member who burned himself to protect state property, finally died of his injuries.
    Comrade Liang Guozhu was born as a worker and worked as a lumberjack for seven years and a porter for four or five years. He possessed the excellent qualities of the working people: a noble morality of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property. Therefore, he has always been active and responsible in his work, and he is good at uniting workers to make progress together. He joined the Communist Party as a probationary member last December. After his sacrifice, the local Party Committee believed that he possessed the lofty qualities of a Communist Party member who was loyal to the Party, loyal to his work, and loyal to the people, and decided to posthumously recognize him as a formal member of the Communist Party of China and posthumously awarded him the honorary title of Model Party Member.

　　“别救我，先救油车！” 
    ——记英勇牺牲的模范党员梁国柱同志
    梁国柱同志在某处车站的油库担任换装员的工作。他把油库当作了自己的家，对油库的安全，注意得无微不至。因为他常见来油库的列车在油库附近喷出火星，就给上级建议：“以后火车来时，要在车头前挂上几辆空车皮，这样车头喷出来的火星就能离油库远点，可以避免引起火灾。”其他工友一到假日都欢喜出去看戏，看电影，梁国柱同志因为怕油库没人防守而发生意外，他就一个人来守护着油库。
    今年三月二十一日，他和八个工友，负责换装一列车油。换装完毕以后，他们就分工整理抽油机，因为怕剩余在机内的油损失了，梁国柱同志准备把它全部抽出来。当时他手里拿着油桶，对着抽油机口接油，他叫工友任登章将电铡（电门）推上。但因任登章技术不够熟练，推得慢了，电铡发出了火星；这时抽油机已通上了电流，将剩下的油猛然推出来，喷了梁国柱同志一身，又因那天的风很大，就把喷出来的油沫和火星，刮在一起燃烧起来，梁国柱同志身上的衣服和手里的油桶也都跟着燃烧起来。油桶里喷出来的火苗，足有五、六米高。梁国柱同志看到这种紧张的情况，他想：这样的火势若蔓延到满装汽油的列车上，一定会引起爆炸性的大火灾。于是他不顾一切的提起油桶飞跑起来。工友们看见他手里拿着起火的油桶，身上的衣服也在燃烧，烧成了一团火，大家都要上来救他，但是他却说：“别管我，快救车旁的火！”他一直跑出了五十米远，才把手里的火桶抛开。这时他的手已被烧焦了，衣服上的火势也愈烧愈猛了，他就昏倒在地上了。
    工友们集中全力，在五六分钟之内，扑灭了火车旁凶猛的火势，再回头来救梁国柱同志时，他已被烈火烧得不成样子了。大家赶忙扯下他燃烧着的衣服。他在昏迷中，还挣扎着喊：“别救我，先救油车！别救我，救油车呀！那是人民的油车呀！……”他因此保全了十六个油车的油和车站的油库。
    工友们迅速的把梁国柱同志抬到汽车上，送到医院里。经过医生检查，认为他的伤势过重，已很难救治。但医生们对这位忠心耿耿的光荣的劳动人民的儿子——梁国柱同志，仍然抱着无限的希望，想使这位英雄继续活下去，为人民多作些工作。他们不惜一次又一次的注射药针，要挽救这位英雄。最后，好容易使梁国柱同志清醒了一些。对此，大家非常兴奋。晚间，工友们都赶来看他。他在半昏迷状态中，仍然问火扑灭了没有。他微笑着说：“我一个人死了不要紧，救住了公家的油车就行了！”他并加重语气，叮嘱大家说：“以后作工作可要特别小心，再不能粗枝大叶了，这是很危险的。”
    就在当天晚上，这位为了维护国家财产而烧伤了自己的优秀的共产党员梁国柱同志，终于因为伤势过重救治无效而逝世了。
    梁国柱同志是工人出身，曾作过七年伐木工和四、五年的搬运工。他具备了劳动人民的优秀品质：爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的高尚道德。因此他在工作中一贯积极负责，并善于团结工友共同进步。他在去年十二月加入共产党为候补党员。他牺牲之后，当地党委认为他已具备了一个共产党员的忠实于党，忠实于工作，忠实于人民的崇高品质，特决定追认他为中国共产党的正式党员，并追赠予模范党员的光荣称号。     （李）
