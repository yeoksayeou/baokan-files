　　American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea is Bound to Fail
    Yan Jici
    American imperialism, violating international treaties and infringing upon the rights of the people, has brazenly launched an armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea. This has not only aroused the anger of the Chinese people and the heroic resistance of the Korean people, but has also aroused the deep disgust of peace-loving people all over the world.
    Due to the shamelessness and hopelessness of America's act of aggression, even its followers, such as Britain and France, dare not cheer and make a show of strength as it had hoped; and its soldiers, because their cause is unjust, are in low spirits and cannot withstand the iron fist blows of the Korean people. Needless to say, since the beginning of the war, the Korean People's Army has won great victories, and will undoubtedly be able to finally crush America's dream. As for Taiwan, it is our territory, and the United States dares to interfere. No matter how rogue and ferocious the United States is, the awakened Chinese people must liberate their own Taiwan from the hands of American imperialists.
    Therefore, the American aggression against Taiwan and Korea is bound to fail.

　　美国侵略台湾和朝鲜必然失败
    严济慈
    美帝国主义违背国际条约，侵害人民权利，悍然武装侵略台湾和朝鲜，不仅惹起了中国人民的愤怒，朝鲜人民的英勇抵抗，同时亦引起了全世界爱好和平的人民的深恶痛绝。
    由于美国这个侵略行为的无耻与无望，甚至连它的尾巴英法等国，亦不敢像它所希望的那样来摇旗呐喊，虚张声势；而它的士兵亦因师出无名，士气低沉，经不起朝鲜人民的铁拳打击。不用说自开战以来朝鲜人民军已获得伟大的胜利，而且必能最后粉碎美国的迷梦而无疑。至于台湾，乃我国领土，美国竟敢横加干涉。不问美国如何无赖与凶顽，觉醒的中国人民一定要从美国帝国主义者手中解放自己的台湾的。
    因此，美国侵略台湾和朝鲜必然失败。
