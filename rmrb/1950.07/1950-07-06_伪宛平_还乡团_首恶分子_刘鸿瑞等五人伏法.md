　　Chief Culprits of the Pseudo Wanping "Homecoming Legion"
    Liu Hongrui and Five Others Executed
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Office: Liu Hongrui, Zhao Yuheng, Dong Yongnian, Xue Zhenjiang, and Zhao Zhanhua, five chief culprits and special agent elements of the pseudo-Wanping County Homecoming Self-Defense Corps (i.e., the "White Armband Gang"), were sentenced to death by the Military Law Office of the Municipal Military Control Commission. On June 23rd, a mass rally of over 5,000 people was held in Mentougou to announce the crimes of the aforementioned criminals, after which they were executed by firing squad on the spot. Accomplices Shi Yuling and Yu Dehai, relying on the power of the pseudo-"White Armbands," persecuted the families of revolutionary cadres and colluded in killing people; each was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Xue Fang, for jointly killing a revolutionary cadre, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.
    Liu Hongrui was a large landlord from Shijaying in the 20th District of this city, and successively served as the district chief, councillor, and member of the pseudo-Wanping County "Suppression of Rebellion and National Construction Committee," and a pseudo-National Assembly representative. He consistently colluded with local bureaucrats, and was a local bully. He once organized a pseudo-"Suppression and Construction Brigade," trained pseudo-Baojia self-defense forces, forced the people to buy guns, and plundered grain from our liberated areas. After the Japanese surrendered, our army once liberated the thirteen villages inside and outside [the city], Liu Hongrui then colluded with Wang Hansan, the pseudo-Wanping County Chief, to organize the Homecoming Legion, massacring thirty-seven of our revolutionary cadres and progressive masses. In addition, the crimes of looting and burning the people's property are too numerous to recount. Zhao Yuheng, also known as Zhao Zigang, was from Lujiatan in the 20th District of this city. He successively served as the deputy head of the 13th Self-Defense Regiment of the 6th District of the Japanese puppet Wanping County. In 1946, he organized a pseudo-self-defense Homecoming Legion in Changxindian, brutally killing our revolutionary cadres and progressive masses, and looting the people's property. In June 1947, the pseudo-Homecoming Legion led by Zhao attacked Yangpoyuan Village in Li Thirteen five times, looting more than 14,000 catties of grain, more than 300 sheep, and more than 20 head of livestock, and killing our guerrilla captain Zhou Xiaosan.
    The remaining three, Dong Yongnian, Xue Zhenjiang, and Zhao Zhanhua, had served as battalion commander and platoon leader of the pseudo-"White Armband Gang," killing our revolutionary personnel, looting public and private property, and committing many evils. As they, along with the aforementioned criminals Liu and Zhao, were all chief special agents, they were all sentenced to death.
