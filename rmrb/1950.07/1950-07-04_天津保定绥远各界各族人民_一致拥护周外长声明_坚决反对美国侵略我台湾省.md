Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. People from all walks of life in North China have unanimously expressed their support for the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and firmly oppose the gangster behavior of US imperialism in armed aggression against China's territory, Taiwan Province.

    Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: Truman's statement cannot scare the Chinese people who have been tempered and tested for a long time. US imperialism has not been able to stop us from liberating the Chinese mainland, nor will it be able to stop us from liberating Taiwan, let alone have the power to stop the victory of the world's people's movement for peace and democracy. Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The Korean People's Army has repelled the invasion of the Lee Seung-man army supported by US imperialism and quickly liberated the Korean capital, Seoul. The Chinese people will also victoriously liberate Taiwan. Long Yin, Director of the Department of Economics at Nankai University, said: The fact that Truman sent a fleet in an attempt to prevent us from liberating Taiwan should make some people who are obsessed with US imperialism abandon their illusions. Other speakers included Liu Zucai, Chairman of the Municipal Student Federation, Luo Yun, Director of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, and Pan Changyou, a model worker from the Tianjin Steel Plant.

    People's organizations in Hebei Province and all walks of life in Baoding City met on June 30 to discuss Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. More than 50 representatives from the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and factories, schools, and business circles in Baoding City attended the meeting. All representatives expressed their warm support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and unanimously believed that Truman's statement completely exposed the true face of US imperialism as undermining peace in the Far East and being hostile to the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people are fully confident and have the confidence to defeat any provocation by US imperialism and liberate Taiwan and all Chinese territory. Feng Yangzhou, a representative of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Li Shuping, a representative of the Provincial Women's Federation, called on workers and women throughout the province to intensify production and practically support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    The people of all nationalities (Mongolian, Han, and Hui) in Suiyuan Province, together with the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Democratic Women's Federation, and other organizations, jointly issued a telegram denouncing the crime of armed aggression by US imperialism.

    天津市总工会主任黄火青说：杜鲁门的声明，是吓唬不了久经锻炼和考验的中国人民的。美帝国主义既没有能阻止我们解放中国大陆，也决不能阻止我们解放台湾，更没有力量阻止世界人民争取和平民主运动的胜利。市工商联合会主任委员李烛尘说：朝鲜人民军已击退了美帝国主义支持的李承晚军队的进犯，并很快地解放了朝鲜首都汉城。中国人民也将胜利地解放台湾。南开大学经济系主任龙吟说：杜鲁门派了舰队妄图阻止我们解放台湾的这件事实，应该使迷恋美帝国主义的一些人放下幻想了。其他发表谈话的还有市学生联合会主席刘祖才、市民主妇女联合会主任罗云、天津炼钢厂劳动模范潘长有等。
    河北省各人民团体及保定市各界于六月三十日集会讨论了周恩来外长的声明，与会的有河北省总工会、青年团、妇联、文联和保定市工厂、学校、工商界等代表五十余人。全体代表对周恩来外长声明表示热烈拥护，并一致认为：杜鲁门的声明完全暴露了美帝国主义破坏远东和平与中国人民为敌的真面目，但是中国人民完全有把握有信心击败美帝国主义的任何挑衅，解放台湾及所有的中国领土。省总工会代表冯洋舟、省妇联代表李叔平号召全省工人、妇女以加紧生产的实际行动，全力支援人民解放军解放台湾。
    绥远省蒙、汉、回各族人民暨省总工会筹委会、青年团、民主青年联合会、民主妇女联合会等团体联名发表通电斥责美帝国主义的武装侵略罪行。
