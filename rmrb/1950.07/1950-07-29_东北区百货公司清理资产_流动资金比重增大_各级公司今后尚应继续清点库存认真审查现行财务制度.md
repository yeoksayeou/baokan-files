　　Northeast China Department Store Clears Assets
    Increased Proportion of Liquid Assets
    All Levels of Companies Should Continue to Take Inventory and Carefully Review Current Financial Systems
    [Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: At the Northeast Provinces and Cities Department Store Managers Conference held on June 19, the Northeast China Department Store Company determined the working capital of the system. In order to further implement economic accounting, it is now thoroughly carrying out the work of clearing assets and liabilities. During the preparation period in June, the items owed by provincial and municipal companies to the district company were reduced, decreasing by 42.6 percent from the beginning of May; at the same time, the accounts with other specialized companies were sorted out, such as the accounts with the Northeast China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, which have been almost completely settled. As a result, the proportion of commodities in the distribution of total assets has gradually approached a reasonable level, rising from 61.7 percent in early May to 68 percent, so that the department store system has shifted from the huge accumulation of fixed assets to a gradual increase in liquid assets, reversing the unreasonable phenomenon in the use of funds in the past in terms of asset distribution. For example, in mid-June, the cash sales of the district company system exceeded May by more than 40 percent. Due to the expansion of sales and the increase in the proportion of liquid funds in the Northeast China Department Store Company, and the reduction of exchanges with provincial and municipal companies, the accounting and financial management work has laid a preliminary foundation for the implementation of economic accounting.

    In order to thoroughly clarify the asset and liability situation, the Northeast China Department Store Company has instructed its subordinate provincial and municipal companies to do the following when clearing and settling accounts: First, all levels of companies are required to thoroughly inventory their stocks. According to the problems found, a large amount of loss and shortage has occurred in the inventory of goods due to lax management and various systems. Therefore, all provinces and cities must conscientiously and thoroughly inventory in the future, effectively grasp the inventory situation, and settle the second quarter accounting books based on the actual inventory, distinguishing the seasonality of various commodities as a basis for determining funds. At the same time, propose a storage work system based on experience.

    Second, the current financial system must be reviewed, and all waste, losses, and corruption phenomena must be checked. According to past materials, the amount of waste and losses caused by lax financial management in companies at all levels is very large. This must be clarified together with this accounting and handled appropriately, educating financial management personnel to correctly understand the system, promptly correcting those who violate the financial system, and resolutely abolishing all "customs" of expenditures that do not conform to economic accounting. Resolutely oppose laxity in financial management and phenomena that violate the system.

    In addition, all levels of companies are required to clear old accounts and deal with bad debts and other items in order to gradually achieve reasonable use of funds and implement economic accounting.

　　东北区百货公司清理资产
    流动资金比重增大       
    各级公司今后尚应继续清点库存认真审查现行财务制度
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：中国百货公司东北区公司在六月十九日召开的东北各省市百货公司经理会议上，确定本系统商品流转资金后，为进一步贯彻经济核算，目前正彻底进行清理资产负债工作。六月准备期中，已经将省市公司欠区公司项目缩小，六月底较五月初减低了百分之四二·六；同时并整理了与其他专业公司之间的往来项目，如与东北区花纱布公司的账目已将近全部结清。因而使总资产分布情况上商品比重逐渐接近合理，已自五月上旬的百分之六十一·七提升至百分之六十八，使百货系统已由巨大的固定资金的积压情况转入流动资金的逐步增大，从资产分布情况上扭转了过去资金运用上的不合理现象。如在六月中区公司系统的卖钱额现款超过了五月份的百分之四十以上。由于东北区百货公司卖钱额扩大，流动资金比重增加，而省市公司往来减少，会计财务管理工作已经为贯彻经济核算打下初步基础。
    东北区百货公司为彻底澄清资产负债情况，已指示所属省市公司在清理结算时必须做好以下几件事情：第一，要求各级公司彻底清点库存。根据发现的问题看来，盘存商品中由于保管及各种制度不严密，已有大量损失及短少情况发生。因此，今后各省市必须认真彻底清点，切实掌握库存情况，并根据实际盘存结清第二季度的会计账，分别各种商品的季节性，作为确定资金的依据。同时，根据经验提出保管工作制度。
    第二，必须审查现行财务制度，检查一切浪费、损失与贪污现象。根据过去材料，各级公司由于财务管理不严造成的浪费损失数字很大，必须在此次结账同时，一齐搞清，分别予以适当处理，教育财务管理人员正确认识制度，对于违反财务制度者迅即纠正，凡一切不合于经济核算的开支“惯例”必须予以取缔。坚决反对在财务管理上的松弛及违反制度的现象。
    此外，并要求各级公司清理旧账，处理赊欠、呆账等项目，为逐步达到合理使用资金，贯彻经济核算而努力。
