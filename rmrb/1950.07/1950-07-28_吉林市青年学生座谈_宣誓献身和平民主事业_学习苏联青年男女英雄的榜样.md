　　Jilin City Youth and Students Hold Symposium
    Vow to Devote Themselves to the Cause of Peace and Democracy
    Learn from the Example of Soviet Young Male and Female Heroes
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jilin City Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Jilin City Student Federation convened a symposium of youth and students. Students from nine secondary schools unanimously demanded peace and opposed the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Comrade Jin Dongming of the First Middle School said: "I firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and oppose Truman's shameless reactionary statement." He further expressed his attitude towards the American imperialists, saying: "I am a member of the Communist Youth League and also a member of the Communist Party. I vow to dedicate all my strength to defend world peace and devote myself to the cause of national liberation." Students at the meeting vied to speak. Comrade Jin Cuiying of the First Middle School said: "I represent all the female students of the school in shouting against the aggression of American imperialism. If the American imperialists really dare to provoke a war, then we vow that when the motherland needs us, we can sacrifice everything and dedicate ourselves to the motherland like the Soviet heroine Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya." Comrade Li Xianzong said: "I represent my parents, older sister, and younger brother in declaring that we firmly oppose imperialist aggression. I swear to Chairman Mao that when the motherland needs me, I will also participate in the battle like the Soviet young hero Alexander Matrosov to eliminate imperialism." Many other students expressed their determination to defend world peace and oppose American aggression.
