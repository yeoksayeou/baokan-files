　　Xinhua News Agency, July 27th. The Yellow River's major flood season is approaching. Under the unified leadership of the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters, the people of all provinces and regions along the river have completed the initial major inspection of the entire river's dikes and are now carrying out repairs on some dangerous sections. The Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters has also, based on the actual situation, specifically stipulated the flood prevention tasks for each section of the Yellow River this summer and the necessary flood storage measures.

　　Since the beginning of the summer flood season, the water level at Longmen rose three times between July 5th and 20th; the water level at Shanzhou rose five times between July 2nd and 21st, reaching 295.5 meters on the 21st, with a flow rate of 6,900 cubic meters per second. This is the prelude to the Yellow River's major flood.

　　To prevent flooding caused by the arrival of the Yellow River's major flood, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, according to the basic spirit of this year's National Flood Prevention Conference regarding the Yellow River flood prevention task, specifically stipulates: "Guarantee that the flow rate at Shanzhou (Henan Province) reaches 17,000 cubic meters per second (according to the maximum flow rate at Shanzhou during last year's Yellow River flood season, which was 16,300 cubic meters per second), the flow rate at Gaocun (Dongming County, Pingyuan Province) is 11,000 cubic meters per second, and the flow rate at Luokou (north of Jinan City, Shandong Province) is 8,500 cubic meters per second without causing breaches." This specific guarantee target is 3,700 cubic meters per second higher than the maximum flow rate last year, aiming to prevent floods larger than those of 1949. Although this year's Yellow River spring repair project has completed 13 million cubic meters of earthwork and made general repairs to dam and revetment dangerous sections, the Yellow River's flood prevention task this year is still very arduous.

　　In order to complete the above flood prevention tasks, Yellow River water conservancy agencies in various places are strengthening their leadership over Yellow River flood prevention. The Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters was established in Kaifeng in late June, and Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong have also established provincial-level Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters to coordinate the overall situation and defend in sections. The flood prevention tasks have been assigned to districts and villages in counties along the river, and mass flood prevention organizations have been widely established according to past practice.

　　Under the leadership of the flood prevention headquarters, people in various provinces have generally carried out dike inspections. For example, the Yellow River dike in Henan Province, because the dike spacing is wide, there are many beaches inside the dike, the dike is far from the water, and because of the late liberation, most of the dikes have not been inspected for twenty years. During this inspection, 283 badger holes and rat burrows were found within the nine-kilometer section from Guangwu to Zhengzhou. These have been filled by the Yellow River engineering team after being found. At the same time, it was also discovered in the Kaifeng and Guangzheng sections that special agents and bandits were digging holes in the dikes and stealing electrical wires. These examples show that people along the river should be more vigilant. In addition, because the Yellow River is prone to siltation and the river channel frequently changes, new dangerous sections often occur. For example, during this year's inspection of dikes, dams, and revetments in Shandong Province, more than 40 dangerous sections were found that needed to be repaired. The Dongbatou dike in the Chen (Liu) Lan (Feng) section of Henan Province experienced a dangerous situation on June 30th, and it was only after throwing timber and emergency rescue that the situation was turned from danger to safety. In addition, the Nanxiaodi dangerous section in Puyang County, Pingyuan Province, was also in danger, and after emergency repairs by nearby people with willow branches and stone materials, it was also turned from danger to safety.

　　The dike spacing of the Yellow River's middle and lower reaches is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. For example, the dike spacing of the Yellow River in Henan is as wide as 13 kilometers, while in some places in Shandong and Pingyuan, the dike spacing is only 300 to 500 meters. The height of the dike top only exceeds the flood level of last year by 1.5 to 3 meters. If the flow rate at Shanzhou is above 17,000 cubic meters per second, it will still not be safely discharged. Therefore, before the fundamental engineering plans such as building reservoirs in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River are realized, we must try our best to find ways to store floodwater to supplement the deficiency of the dikes. Based on the above situation, the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters decided to implement the following measures when necessary: (1) Abandon the people's embankments. (2) Relocate residents north of Nanwang Jinxiangling on the south bank of Pingyuan and south of Shouzhang Jindi on the north bank to implement flood storage. (3) Dongping Lake and the riverine areas of Changqing and Pingyin in Shandong Province have the function of regulating floods and must still be used for flood storage. At present, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is actively carrying out preparatory work in cooperation with the people's governments of various provinces.

### 黄河堤防完成大检查  现正进行修补险工准备防汛

　　黄河堤防完成大检查
    现正进行修补险工准备防汛
    【新华社二十七日讯】黄河大汛即将到来。沿河各省区人民在河黄防汛总指挥部统一领导下，已经完成全河堤防的初次大检查，现在正进行部分险工的修补工作。黄河防汛总指挥部并已根据实际情况，具体规定黄河各段今夏的防汛任务和必要时的蓄洪措施。
    黄河自入夏汛期以来，龙门水位曾于七月五日至二十日先后上涨三次；陕州水位自七月二日至二十一日上涨五次，二十一日水位达二九五点五公尺，流量六千九百秒公方。这是黄河大汛的前奏。
    为预防黄河大汛到来时引起水患，黄河水利委员会根据今年全国防汛会议关于黄河防汛任务的基本精神具体规定：“保证陕州（河南省境）流量达到一万七千秒公方（按去年黄河汛期陕州最大流量是一万六千三百秒公方），高村（平原省东明县境）流量一万一千秒公方，泺口（山东省济南市北）流量八千五百秒公方时不发生溃决。”这个具体的保证任务，比去年的最大流量提高了三千七百秒公方，以防比一九四九年更大的洪水为目标。今年黄河春修工程，虽然已完成土方一千三百万公方，对于坝埽险工也作了一般的修整，但今年黄河的防汛任务仍然是十分艰巨的。
    为了完成上述防汛任务，各地黄河水利机关正加强对黄河防汛的领导。黄河防汛总指挥部已于六月下旬在开封成立，河南、平原、山东也都分别成立了省的黄河防汛指挥部，以便统筹全局，分段防守。沿河各县并把防汛任务布置到区、村，根据历年旧例，广泛建立了群众的防汛组织。
    各省人民在防汛指挥部领导下业已普遍进行堤防检查。如河南省境的黄河大堤，因为堤距较宽，堤内滩岸多，堤距水较远，又因解放较晚，大部堤防已经二十年没有经过检查。这次检查，在广（武）郑（州）段九公里内就检查出獾洞鼠穴二百八十三处。查出后已由黄河工程队填平。同时，开封段和广郑段还发现有特务匪徒在堤上挖洞和偷割电线。这些事例说明，沿河人民应提高警惕性。此外，由于黄河多沙善淤，河道经常变迁，新险工时常发生。如山东省在今年堤防、坝、埽的检查中，曾发现四十余处险工需要进行修整。河南陈（留）兰（封）段东坝头堤防，六月三十日曾发生险象，经过抛枕木和抢护才转危为安。此外，平原省濮阳县南小堤险工也曾告急，经附近人民用柳枝石料紧急抢修，亦转危为安。
    黄河中下游堤距上宽下窄，如河南黄河堤距宽达十三公里，山东、平原有的地方堤距不过三至五百公尺。堤顶高度仅超过去年洪水位一点五至三公尺。如果陕州流量在一万七千秒公方以上，仍将不能安全排泄。因此，在黄河中上游建立水库等治本工程计划未实现前，必须尽力设法蓄洪，以济堤防的不足。黄河防汛总指挥部根据以上情况，决定必要时实行以下措施：（一）放弃民埝。（二）在南岸的平原南旺金线岭以北，北岸的寿张金堤以南迁移居民，实行蓄洪。（三）东平湖及山东省的长清、平阴沿河地区，有调节洪水的作用，仍须用以蓄洪。目前黄委会正协同各省人民政府积极进行准备工作。
