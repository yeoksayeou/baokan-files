　　Slogans Promoting Mobilization at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory
　　Li Jun
　　The slogans used by the Party for promotion and mobilization at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory have become an important part of the factory's entire promotional and mobilization efforts. These slogans are mainly based on production needs and an understanding of the workers' ideological trends. The specific process involves "concentrating" the correct and positive aspects of the workers' thinking (even if they are only emerging), and then, based on the Party's policies, proposing action slogans that they are familiar with or easily accept, and "persisting with them."

　　Strive to "Stamp Every Machine with a Steel Seal"
　　After the factory proposed short slogans in the winter of 1949 to improve quality, the workers were not entirely confident about achieving the quality improvements and were afraid of failing inspections. In early March, the Machinery Bureau inspected the lathes and stamped three of them with a "qualified" steel seal. At that time, the leadership seized this opportunity, issued a news bulletin, and called on all workers in the factory to strive to ensure that "every machine is stamped with a steel seal." Thus, "stamp every machine with a steel seal" became a universally known goal in the No. 3 Factory. When Party and administrative comrades asked about the quality of the lathes in the assembly shop, they immediately said: "We guarantee that every machine will be stamped with a steel seal." By the end of the month, thirty lathes had been stamped with steel seals in this manner. To celebrate this victory, Li Hanhua, a propagandist, painted a huge picture: "Stamp Every Machine with a Steel Seal, Maintain the Honor of the No. 3 Factory," and placed it at the entrance.

　　"Create a Model Workshop"
　　In April, based on the work plan for April, May, and June, the Party focused its promotional efforts on learning from the Ma Hengchang Group, establishing a responsibility system, and improving quality in the second quarter. At that time, the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League jointly organized more than sixty technicians to visit the No. 5 Factory to see the Ma Hengchang Group. However, after returning, the workers, on the one hand, worked actively, using the spirit of the Ma Hengchang Group to implement their own responsibility systems and strive to improve quality. On the other hand, they were generally unconvinced, believing that they also had a Ma Hengchang Group, but it had not been written about and published in the newspaper. After analyzing the factory's specific situation, the general branch believed that it was possible to create a model workshop. Therefore, it immediately launched discussions in the workshops through the trade union. Even before the leadership formally announced this slogan, the workers had already shouted out "create a model workshop" as their goal. Each workshop worked actively towards this goal. On April 19th, the factory news reported that the sixth workshop had completed its monthly production task eleven days ahead of schedule, with only one defective product out of more than 5,200 processed parts, and the quality had significantly improved.

　　According to the inspection results in late May, the model workshop was already taking shape. For example, some groups in the first workshop, in addition to completing their May tasks ahead of schedule, had also completed part of their June work.

　　"Welcome the Veteran to Take Action!"
　　During the creation of the model workshop in the first workshop, the veteran workers were discussing: "Which foreman didn't come out of our 'First Field' (i.e., the first workshop)? Most of the leadership cadres in other workshops were promoted from the First Field. Now even a kid who can only 'turn' twenty screws a day (referring to the young workers) wants to challenge us. Let them challenge us. 'One veteran taking action is worth two ordinary workers.' I can do forty a day!" At this time, the Party seized this typical example of thinking and began talking to the veteran technical workers in the first workshop: "We heard that you veterans are going to take action, is that right?" The workers laughed. "One veteran taking action is worth two ordinary workers. What if they don't take action? Then two veterans are only worth one ordinary worker!" Because the work in the first workshop was more important, "Welcome the Veteran to Take Action!" became the expected slogan of the entire factory. Soon, thirteen "veterans" took action and created new records. Among them, Wu Fengxiang reduced the original 12-point lead screw gearbox to 5:40 (saving 6:20 working hours). Later, the Party organization also held "Veteran Symposiums" to explain to the workers that this initiative and creativity was a concrete manifestation of patriotism. They also held a "Welcome the Veteran to Take Action" rally to express their expectations and respect for them.

　　"Assemble Ten Standard Products" "Trace the Root and Check the Responsibility System"
　　To welcome Red May, the Party organization called on all workers in the factory to "assemble ten standard products" in May as a gift for Red May, as the factory had never produced standard products before. In order to achieve this, the administration also promptly hired flame-hardening workers and promulgated six systems throughout the factory, including the group product quality inspection system, the group responsibility inspection system, and the group production schedule. Because the administration took many measures to realize this slogan, it provided a strong guarantee for the realization of assembling ten standard products. For example, because the bed group in the assembly shop established a quality chart, none of the ten technicians, including Li Jixun, wanted to produce a second-class product. Later, when a material shortage was discovered in the assembly shop, the slogan "Trace the Root and Check the Responsibility System" was put forward, and it was decided to create a "Tracing the Root Report" to work in conjunction with this slogan. By late May, when difficulties arose in assembling standard products, the specific slogan "Find the Problems" was put forward, resulting in the identification and overcoming of fourteen operational problems and difficulties. In this way, the factory transformed from a situation where it had never assembled a single standard product in the past to successfully assembling ten standard products, creating an unprecedented new quality record.

### 沈阳第三机器厂的宣传鼓动口号

　　沈阳第三机器厂的宣传鼓动口号
    李军
    沈阳第三机器厂的党的宣传鼓动口号，已成为该厂整个宣传鼓动工作的重要部分。这些宣传鼓动口号，主要是依据生产需要和在了解工人群众的思想动态后提出来的。具体过程就是把工人群众的思想的正确部分和积极部分“集中上来”（那怕是萌芽）再根据党的政策，提出他们所熟悉的，或易于接受的行动口号，“坚持下去”。
    争取“台台打上钢印”
    经过一九四九年冬该厂提出简短口号提高质量后，因工人对提高质量心里尚不托底，怕检查时不合格。三月上旬，机械局检查车床，在三台车床上都打上了合格的钢印。当时，领导上即抓住这一机会，印发新闻快报，号召全厂工人们为保证“台台打上钢印”而奋斗。这样“台台打上钢印”便成为三厂人人皆知的努力目标了。当党和行政的同志再到装配场问起车床质量时，他们立刻就说：保它“台台打上钢印”。到月底三十台车床就这样的台台打上了钢印。为了庆贺这一胜利，并有鼓动员李汉华画了一幅巨画：“台台打上钢印，保持三厂荣誉”置于门口。
    “创造模范车间”
    四月份，党根据四、五、六月份工作计划，以学习马恒昌小组，建立责任制，提高质量为第二季宣传鼓动内容。当时党、行政、工会、青年团共同组织了六十多个技工到五厂参观马恒昌小组。但回来后，工人们一方面积极工作，以学习马恒昌小组的精神来贯彻自己的责任制，努力提高质量，另方面却普遍的不服气，均认为我们也有马恒昌小组，只是没有写出来登报。总支分析该厂具体情况后，认为有条件来创造模范车间。因此立即通过工会在车间进行酝酿讨论。在领导上还没有正式发布这一口号时，工人们已把“创造模范车间”作为自己的奋斗目标喊出去了。各车间都为这个目标积极的工作着，四月十九日工厂新闻中写着：第六车间提前十一天完成全月生产任务，五千二百多件加工品中只有一件废品，质量显著提高。
    根据五月下旬检查结果，模范车间已有雏形，如第一车间有部分小组除把五月份任务提前完成外，并把六月份的部分工作也完成了。
    “欢迎老将出马！”
    第一车间工友们在创造模范车间中，老工友们都议论着：“那个工长不是咱们一场（即第一车间）出去的（因第一车间大多数是老技工，其他车间的工长等领导干部大部分是一场提拔出去的），一天“车”二十个螺丝的小孩子（指青年工友）也要挑战了，挑就挑，“老将出马一个顶两”，我一天干他四十个。”这时，党就抓住了这一思想典型，向第一车间的老技术工友们开始了谈话：“听说你们老将要出马了，是吗？”工人们笑了。“老将出马一个顶两，要是不出马呢？那可就是两个顶一个了。”因为第一车间工作较重要，于是“欢迎老将出马”便成为全厂的期待口号喊了出来。随即就有十三个“老将”出马创造了新纪录，其中吴凤祥以原有十二点的走刀齿轮箱减缩为五点四十分（节省工时六点二十分）。以后党组织又分别召开了“老将座谈会”，向工人说明这种积极性和创造性就是爱国主义的具体表现。并开了“欢迎老将出马”大会，以表示对他们的期待和尊敬。
    “装配十台标准品”  “追根检查责任制”
    为了迎接红五月，党组织号召全厂工人在五月份内“装配十台标准品”作为红五月的献礼，因该厂从来没有出过标准品。行政上为了实现它，也及时的聘请了沾火工人，并在全厂颁布了小组产品质量检查制，小组责任检查制，小组生产进度表等六种制度。由于行政上采取了为实现这个口号的许多措施，这就使实现装配十台标准品有了有力的保证。如装配场床身组因为建立了质量表，使得该组李积勋等十个技工，谁也不愿出一件二级品。以后在发现装配场发生待料现象时，又提出了“追根检查责任制”的口号，并决定创办“追根报”来结合这一口号进行工作。至五月下旬，装配标准品发生困难时，又提出了“找毛病”的具体口号，结果找出和克服了十四种操作毛病和困难。这样就使该厂从过去从未装配过一台标准品的情况变为胜利装配十台标准品，创造了空前质量新纪录。（附图片）
