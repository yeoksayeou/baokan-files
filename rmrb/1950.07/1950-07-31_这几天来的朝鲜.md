　　These Recent Days in Korea
    By Soviet Author Wofuke, Keerniluofu
    At dawn on June 25th, the sound of artillery fire rang out in the "38th Parallel" area. The puppet army of the Li Seung-man clique, betraying its trust, crossed the border and advanced towards the counties of Kaesong, Cheorwon, and Yangyang, invading North Korea by one to two kilometers. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ordered the Republic's Guards to resist this shameless attack. At the same time, it ordered the Ministry of Interior to declare to the Li Seung-man government that if it did not cease its provocative actions, it would bear full responsibility for the consequences.

    Prior to this bandit-like attack, there had been numerous provocations. Between January and September of 1949 alone, Li Seung-man's executioners launched 43 land attacks and 92 naval assaults, not including the air force harassing incursions across the "38th Parallel." A series of invasions and provocations resulted in damage to 136 villages, displacing more than 500 families. Two hundred peaceful residents of North Korea were murdered. Two thousand five hundred residents were forcibly taken to South Korea. Recently, attacks on border areas have become a daily occurrence. Li Seung-man, the head of the hired group of murderers, announced on February 28th at the so-called "National Assembly": "We must carry out a northern expedition within the year."

    While Li Seung-man was using weapons to intimidate and boast, social organizations and political parties in both North and South Korea were doing their best to strive for peaceful reunification in order to avoid fratricide.

    We remember that last year, the Congress of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, attended by 71 political parties and social organizations (including 52 political parties and social organizations from South Korea), formulated specific proposals for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. In its letter to the entire nation, the congress proposed simultaneous elections in both North and South Korea in September 1949 to elect a unified supreme legislative body for the entire country, which would draft a constitution and organize a unified government based on the constitution. However, the Li Seung-man "government" not only did not accept this proposal for peaceful reunification of Korea, but even considered it unnecessary to respond.

    In June of this year, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland again put forward a proposal for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The Central Committee formulated a suitable plan and sent a delegation to South Korea to convey it. However, the South Korean puppet government, disregarding all international conventions, immediately arrested the delegates and subjected them to brutal torture.

    Despite this, the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, representing the will of the Korean people, submitted a proposal to the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly regarding promoting peaceful reunification. The Presidium of the People's Assembly passed a resolution proposing to merge the existing legislative bodies of North and South Korea to jointly draft a new constitution for the republic, and to hold national elections based on the new constitution in early August. However, the new despicable provocation on the morning of June 25th was the response of the US imperialist South Korean puppets to the peaceful proposal.

    The sunlit, bustling Pyongyang suddenly became serious. Heavy curtains made of straw were hung on the windows of every house; large buckets filled with yellow sand soil dug from the banks of the Taedong River appeared on the sidewalks. At dusk, the gradually darkening streets were submerged in darkness. Cars disguised their headlights. This peaceful, bustling street, like other cities in the north, put on its war clothes at all times. The entire people of North Korea, as if one person, stood up to resist the Li Seung-man traitorous clique.

    Premier Kim Il-sung's letter to the entire nation was filled with simple, courageous words:

    "The army of the puppet government of the traitor Li Seung-man launched a full-scale attack on the area north of the 38th Parallel on June 25th. The brave Republic Guards launched fierce battles to resist the enemy's attack and thwarted the attack of the Li Seung-man puppet government's army. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, after discussing the current situation, has ordered our People's Army to begin a counter-offensive to eliminate the enemy's armed forces."

    Now, the radio broadcasts brief war reports from the front every two hours, and the residents of Pyongyang gather around to listen. Whenever they hear good news, their faces show bright joy. The war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, provoked by the Li Seung-man reactionaries, has become a just war for the liberation of the Korean people.

    The entire people of North Korea are fervently supporting their army. Workers have launched a surge of labor in order to do everything possible to support victory. Farmers are guaranteeing to expand autumn harvest records. Rallies are surging across the country. The Pyongyang Artificial Silk Factory, with more than 500 workers, convened a meeting in the green stadium during the lunch break. Work team leader Han Jingzhan (transliteration) said:

    "For three days, we have completed 150 percent of our plan every day. We assure our dear soldiers that we will strive to achieve even higher production indices."

    Worker Zhuo Xingen (transliteration) excitedly said to everyone:

    "My brother has joined the war of liberation. I will also take on his work and complete the work standard for two people."

    The Pyongyang construction workers who are laying new transportation lines guarantee to complete all work 20 days ahead of schedule. Farmer Jin Qiangsu (transliteration) from Song Shengbi (transliteration) village near Pyongyang, said at the meeting:

    "Let our soldiers rest assured. The farmers of North Korea will supply as much grain as the army needs."

    An old woman followed up, saying:

    "My son is resisting the enemy's bandit-like attacks. To help his brothers in South Korea, he crossed the hateful '38th Parallel'. Today, we all heard that our glorious battle achievements have caused the cowardly 'government' of the traitor Li Seung-man to flee in disarray from Seoul."

    Now, Pyongyang is as quiet as usual. Factory chimneys are spewing smoke as before. Trams filled with passengers are running, and groups of university students who have just finished their exams are walking around. Li Seung-man boasted more than once that he could wipe out the Northern People's Army in one fell swoop. Under the first powerful blow of the North Korean People's Army, he was frightened and ran away with his group.

    In the newly liberated cities and villages of the South, people's committees and farmers' associations are rapidly being established. Hundreds of advanced workers and farmers have left Pyongyang to explain the truth of free life to their compatriots who have long been deceived by the traitorous "government," and to help them build a new happy life. Among them are workers from the Pyongyang Cork Factory, young female workers from the silk weaving factory, and students from Kim Il-sung University.

    At night, Pyongyang continues its daily life. The National Art Theater is staging a new type of "Ballet Concert" starring the young, talented people's female dancer Cui Chengxi. Theaters and clubs are crowded. But in the morning, people gather around the radio to hear the new news from the front.

    ………The beasts of Wall Street are extremely ferocious. They cowardly attack the peaceful cities of North Korea from the air.

    In Pyongyang, the workday ended, and the tram filled with the first shift of workers sped along the street; on the street, mothers held or carried the children they had just picked up from the nurseries. Suddenly, the sirens resounded throughout the peaceful city. People stood and looked at the cloudless sky. It was hard to believe that death would strike this peaceful city from the blue heights.

    But the fierce outline of the bombers appeared on the horizon: nine planes, then another nine, then another nine. The planes flew lower and lower, dropping bombs on the civilian houses of Pyongyang, dozens, hundreds of them.

    The symbols of American imperialism are marked on the planes that bring death and disaster. Houses were burning; vehicles carrying the wounded took injured women, the elderly, and children to the hospital. People wept for their loved ones who died on this clear June evening.

    Everything - the burnt ruins, the destroyed houses, and the fresh blood on the streets of Pyongyang, this is the realization of the order of Wall Street fellow Truman.

    The residents, filled with hatred for the robbers from across the ocean, united and calmly extinguished the flames and dug air raid shelters in their homes.

    On June 29th, thousands of bombs were dropped on the peaceful residents of Pyongyang.

    One bloody crime after another committed by the desperate robbers. On July 3rd, the American aerial robbers came again for a new attack.

    Two bodies lay on the blood-stained pavement: a young woman along with a nine-month-old baby girl tied to her back in the Korean custom with a wide and brightly colored cloth. The baby girl's face was shattered. Not far from here, a small house was burning, and plumes of black smoke were spreading. We saw such a tragic scene on July 3rd on the peaceful Songhua Street in Pyongyang. But not long ago, thousands of spectators came here to visit the grand exhibition commemorating the fourth anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

    The calm city of Pyongyang lives in vigilant tension. Morning, day, dusk, there is an alert almost every two hours. At dawn on July 3rd, the sky over Pyongyang was filled with the roaring sound of American planes. Light dive bombers equipped with small cannons, jet fighters, and B-29 "Air Fortresses" bombed peaceful residents. Fighters flew low over the streets, strafing houses, shelling trams, and farmers traveling on the highway from Zhennampo to Pyongyang, and bombing stalls in the market selling southern fruits, fresh fish, and rice. Seventy American planes were brazen in the skies over the city that day.

    Such is the beastly face of American imperialism!

    The people of Pyongyang are working selflessly despite the bombing. They insist on continuing to improve work standards and increase labor productivity. Speakers at the Pyongyang 40,000-person meeting explained this matter simply and clearly. In the resolution of the meeting, the robber-like behavior of American imperialists was written down with extraordinary anger, and the vow to contribute all efforts to defend the motherland was written down.

    Protests against the bestial acts of American imperialists have been sent from Korea to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, the executive committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Democratic Women's Federation, and the World Federation

　　这几天来的朝鲜
    苏联  沃富克  科尔尼洛夫作
    六月二十五日拂晓，炮声在“三八”线地区响了。李承晚傀儡伪军背信地冲过了边界，向开城、铁原和襄阳各县进犯，便侵入了北朝鲜一公里至二公里。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府命令共和国警备队抵抗这一无耻的进攻。同时命令内务部向李承晚政府宣告：如果它不停止其挑衅行为，那就对所发生的后果，要负完全的责任。
    在这强盗的进攻以前，发生过许多次挑衅。仅在一九四九年一月至九月之间，李承晚的刽子手们就曾发动了陆地进攻四十三次和海上攻击九十二次，这还没有把空军越过“三八”线的骚扰计算在内。一系列的侵犯和挑衅的结果，使一百三十六个村庄受到了损害，使五百个以上的家庭流离失所。北朝鲜二百个和平居民被残杀了。二千五百个居民被硬拉到南朝鲜去。近来进攻边界区成为日常的事情了。雇佣的凶手集团的头子李承晚，于二月二十八日曾在所谓的“国民会议”中宣布：“年内一定要北伐”。
    当李承晚以武器来恫吓和夸耀之际，南北朝鲜的社会团体和政党却都在尽力争取和平统一，以避免同族相残。
    我们还记得：去年有七十一个政党和社会团体（其中包括南朝鲜五十二个政党和社会团体）所参加的朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线代表大会，曾拟订了祖国和平统一的具体提议。在这次会议的告全国人民书中，建议在一九四九年九月同时在南北朝鲜选举全国统一的最高的立法机关，由这立法机关制定宪法，依据宪法组织统一的政府。但是，李承晚“政府”不仅没有接受这个和平统一朝鲜的建议，而且甚至认为没有回答的必要。
    今年六月，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会，又提出了和平统一祖国的建议。中央委员会制定了一个适当的计划，并派代表团赴南朝鲜传达。但是，南朝鲜伪政府却不顾一切国际惯例，立即把代表们逮捕起来，加以残酷的刑讯。
    尽管如此，代表朝鲜人民意志的祖国统一民主主义战线，还是把关于促进和平统一的建议提交朝鲜最高人民会议主席团。人民会议主席团通过了一项决议，建议把现存的南北朝鲜立法机关合并起来，一同制定共和国的新宪法，定于八月初旬在新宪法的基础上，举行全民选举。但是，六月二十五日早晨新的卑鄙的挑衅，就是美帝南朝鲜傀儡对于和平建议的回答。
    阳光普照的、热闹的平壤，突然变得严肃了。每个屋子的窗户上都挂上了用稻草做成的沉重的窗帘；在人行道上出现了装满了从大同江岸挖来的黄沙土的大桶。黄昏时候，逐渐暗下去的大街沉没在一片漆黑之中。汽车把前灯伪装起来。这个和平热闹的大街不论在什么时候，也像北部其他城市一样，披上了战衣。北朝鲜全体人民，为了抵抗李承晚卖国集团，好像是一个人似的站起来了。
    金日成总理告全国人民书中，充满了质朴的、勇敢的话：
    “卖国贼李承晚的傀儡政府军队，于六月二十五日在三八线全线向以北地区发动了全面的进攻。勇敢的共和国警备队为抵抗敌人的进攻，展开了激烈的战斗，挫败了李承晚傀儡政府军队的进攻。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在讨论了当前的形势后，已命令我们的人民军开始反攻，消灭敌人的武装力量”。
    现在，无线电每隔两个钟头广播一次前线解放战争的简要战报，平壤的居民大家围聚着听。每逢听到令人高兴的新消息，他们的脸上就呈显出光辉的喜色。为李承晚反动派所挑起的反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，变成了朝鲜人民争取解放的正义战争。
    北朝鲜全体人民狂热地支援着自己的军队。工人们为要尽一切力量支持胜利，掀起了劳动的热潮。农人们保证着扩大秋收的纪录。集会在全国各地汹涌地展开了。拥有五百个以上工人的平壤人造丝工厂，在绿色的体育场利用吃午饭的休息时间召集了大会。工作队长韩静展（译音）说：
    “三天来，我们每天都把计划完成了百分之一百五十。我们向我们的亲爱的战士们保证还要努力达到更高的生产指数。”
    工人卓兴恩（译音）兴奋地向大家说：
    “我的兄弟已参加了解放战争。我要把他的工作也承担起来，我要完成两个人的工作标准。”
    正在铺设新运输干线的平壤建筑工人们，保证提前二十天完成全部工作。平壤附近的松胜壁（译音）村的农民金强素（译音），在大会上说：
    “让我们的战士们安心吧。军队需要多少粮食，我们北朝鲜农民就供给多少。”
    一个老大娘跟着说：
    “我的儿子，抵抗着敌人强盗似的进攻。为了帮助在南朝鲜的自己的兄弟们，他越过了可憎的‘三八’线。今天，我们都听到了：我们光荣的战绩，使卖国贼李承晚的怯懦‘政府’从汉城狼狈逃跑了。”
    现在，平壤安静如常。工厂的烟筒像从前一样喷吐着浓烟。挤满乘客的电车驶行着，刚完毕了考试的一群群的大学生行走着。李承晚不只一次地夸口说过，一下子就可以消灭北部人民军。在北朝鲜人民军第一次强有力的打击下，他就吓破了胆，带着他那一群人逃跑了。
    在刚被解放的南部的城市和村庄，迅速地产生了人民委员会和农民联合会。数以百计的先进的工人和农民离开了平壤，要向久受卖国“政府”蒙蔽的同胞们解释自由生活的真理，要帮助他们建设新的幸福的生活。他们中间有：平壤软木工厂的工人，丝织工厂的青年女工和金日成大学的大学生们。
    在夜间，平壤继续着平日一样的生活。国家艺术剧院上演着年轻的天才人民女舞蹈家崔承喜主演的新型《巴莱舞音乐会》。各剧院和各俱乐部都挤满了人。但是，一到早晨，人们却又围聚在播音机周围，听取前方的新消息。
    ………华尔街的野兽们凶恶到极点。他们卑怯地从空中攻击北朝鲜的和平城市。
    在平壤，一天的劳动日完了，坐满了第一班工人的电车，沿着大街奔驰着；大街上，母亲们手里拉着或是背着从托儿所刚领回来的孩子们。突然警笛声响彻了这和平的城市。人们站着看无云的天空。很难相信，从蔚蓝色的高空，死亡会袭击这和平的城市。
    但是，轰炸机的凶狠的轮廓在地平线上出现了：九架，又是九架，又是九架。飞机愈飞愈低，向平壤的民房，投下炸弹来，数十颗、数百颗。
    在带来死亡和灾难的飞机上，标志着美国帝国主义的符号。房子燃烧着；搬运伤兵的车子把受伤的妇女、老人、小孩送到医院去。人们恸哭着死在这晴朗的六月黄昏的亲人。
    所有的一切——烧剩的废墟炸毁的房屋和平壤大街上的鲜血，这就是华尔街伙计杜鲁门的命令的实现。
    充满着对海洋彼岸强盗们的愤恨的居民，齐心协力，毫不慌张地，把火焰扑灭，在自己家里挖好避弹壕。
    六月二十九日，数以千计的炸弹向平壤的和平居民投掷下来。
    孤注一掷的强盗们的血腥罪恶一件接着一件。七月三日那天，美国空中强盗又来了一次新的袭击。
    血染的铺道上有着两个尸体：一个年轻的女人连同按朝鲜习惯用宽大而鲜艳的布系在背后的九个月的小女孩。这小女孩的脸孔被炸碎了。离这儿不远，小房子燃烧着，黑烟团蔓延着。我们在七月三日，在平壤的和平的松花大街上看到了这样一副惨景。但是，不久以前就有几千个观众到这里参观过纪念朝鲜解放四周年的盛大展览会。
    平静的平壤城生活在警觉的紧张中。早晨，白天，黄昏，几乎每隔两个钟头，就有一次警报。在七月三日的黎明，平壤的天空充满了美国飞机的轰轰声音。装备着小炮的轻俯冲轰炸机，喷气式驱逐机，还有Ｂ二九“航空堡垒”轰炸着和平的居民。驱逐机在大街上低空掠过，扫射着房屋，炮击着电车，以及在镇南浦至平壤的公路上行走的农民，滥炸着市场上许多贩卖南方水果，鲜鱼和大米的摊子。美国飞机七十架这一天放肆在这个城市的上空。
    美国帝国主义的野兽面貌就如此！
    平壤的人们不顾轰炸而忘我地劳动着。他们坚持着继续提高工作标准，提高劳动生产率。平壤四万人大会上的发言者们，简单明确地说明了这件事情。在大会的决议中，异常愤怒地写出了美国帝国主义者的强盗行为，写出了要供献一切力量来保卫祖国的誓言。
    反对美国帝国主义者兽行的抗议书。从朝鲜向世界拥护和平大会常设委员会、世界工联执委会、国际民主妇联、世界民主青年联盟发出去。朝鲜各方面领导人士和社会团体积极分子几百万人在这个抗议书上签了名。
    朝鲜人民团结成一个统一的战斗的家庭。朝鲜人民相信全世界正义的人们都支持他们正义的事业。他们为自己的自由，独立和民主而战斗。他们对正义事业胜利的信心是不可动摇的。
    六月二十七日晚上，平壤电台广播了一个令人愉快的消息：人民军一部已经包围了汉城。
    次日十一点三十分，人民军开进了这个朝鲜的故都。勇敢的部队——人民的使者——占领了傀儡总统住了五年的奢华的官邸，夺取了邮政局、电话局、银行、中央检察厅，从一切据点赶走了惊慌丧胆的李承晚残兵。在政治犯面前，打开了老旧的西大门监狱的大门，在这个恐怖的地方，在血腥的考验前没有屈服的，光荣的爱国者们，勇敢地向刽子手们说过：真理是一定战胜的。
    人民军的指战员和战士们攻入了汉城广播电台。他们走进李承晚的宣传员们急忙逃走一空的播音室去，发现一张准备广播的“文告”，他们就开心得笑起来。在那个“文告”上歇斯特里地叫嚣着：“我们永远不撤离汉城。北朝鲜军队不会进汉城来”。
    新的广播应当开始了，可是人民军的战士和指战员们没有准备好任何演讲词。
    “我们就讲一些我们每个人现在的感想吧！”其中一个指战员说。
    五年来第一次这电台开始播送了从内心发出的诚实的话。战士们吸引着汉城居民走向广场，大街，小路，同时也听到当地老百姓欢迎的话，他们把自由带给朝鲜的故都了。
    恰正八点十五分，汉城广播电台第一次从平壤转播了金日成的讲话。全朝鲜每个角落的人民静听着他讲。他祝贺汉城居民获得了解放，号召他们恢复城内的治安，命令游击队扩大战线，紧密配合人民军的进攻。南朝鲜的人民听到了自己民族领袖的这些镇定的充满信心的话，不由得想起了李承晚的狡猾的空言，李承晚就在上一天夜间广播过杂乱无章使人不解的演说，他在其中发誓说一定能够战胜人民军，还夸耀自己有大量美式武器的配备。
    欢呼着的南朝鲜人民到处欢迎人民军。农民们把家中最好的东西——干鱼，上等水果，番茄和一碗碗的香甜的米饭——拿出来送给英勇的人民解放战士们。
    在人民军所解放的城市和乡村，人们摆脱了暴力和专制的枷锁，满怀信心地把政权掌握到自己的手里。在白川、开城和长湍，人民委员会建立起来。在委员会中选出了对李承晚集团进行忘我的战斗的爱国者们。
    在白川的大会上，全城的居民来参加，表示对人民军的热爱与感激。在京畿道南部的大会上，古龚村（译音）的农民李肃本感动地说：
    “今天我们获得了幸福。我们这一带村子的居民一直到现在还活着，只是因为在北部的好兄弟们帮助了我们。在三八线以北，靠近南部四十个村庄的开贡贮水池可以灌溉一万三千公顷田地、北部的人们在自由的土地上求得丰收，也是需要水的。可是由于我们的要求，这些年来他们把水放给了我们。然而南朝鲜喝人血的地主们却对好兄弟们赠给我们的水，硬要我们付钱，同时我们的收成又几乎全部被他们夺去。去年我收获了二十袋大米，自己只留下五袋，其余都给地主了。现在，我在自己自由的土地上可以安静地劳动了。”
    从南方来的消息说，人民的军队粉碎了压制朝鲜人民的匪军，正在向前推进，把解放带给全朝鲜的人民。
