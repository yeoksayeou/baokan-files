　　Neglecting Labor Protection Work, Abusing Labor Protection Funds
    Tianjin Textile Trade Union Reviews Mistakes
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union has conducted a review regarding its failure to actively lead and promote labor protection work in various textile factories under the China Textile system over the past year, as well as the serious errors that occurred in the management and use of labor protection funds.
    Since May of last year, various China Textile factories in Tianjin have been paying 3% of their total wages to the trade union each month as labor protection fees, forming a labor protection fund. However, it was not until February of this year that the trade union announced and implemented the labor protection regulations; as of May, only 13.65% of the labor protection fund had been spent, and marriage expenses accounted for 17.13% of all expenditures. At the same time, the trade union deposited the fund, equivalent to more than 3 million jin of corn flour, in the bank, preventing the difficulties of many workers from being resolved and wasting a huge amount of state funds.
    The errors in the management and use of labor protection funds were even more serious. In June of last year, when prices were fluctuating, Du Yuan, the former production minister of the trade union, used more than 200 million yuan of labor protection funds to purchase flour from northern Anhui, supplying it to the workers of various factories. The quality was low, and the price was high, causing great dissatisfaction among the workers. Later, Du Yuan used the more than 100,000 jin of corn flour earned from the flour business to open a soy sauce factory and a shoe factory, engaging in business; and he placed a large number of his relatives and friends in the factories. Due to poor management and extravagance, the two factories lost a total of more than 30,000 jin of corn flour within half a year. Du then arbitrarily misappropriated 20,000 jin of labor protection fund corn flour to subsidize them. In addition, without asking for instructions or reporting, he used the fund to buy two houses successively. All this greatly affected the credibility of the trade union.
    The Municipal Committee believes that the reasons for the above errors are, first of all, the serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres. There was only individual leadership, lacking strict collective leadership and a sound working system, and therefore failing to check the work and summarize experiences in a timely manner. For example, the issue of using labor protection funds to open two factories was not discussed by the Municipal Committee beforehand, and there was no investigation afterward. After the National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union last year, although it was recognized that labor protection fees should not be used to run factories, and it was decided at that time to hand the factories over to the Joint Cooperative for management, the result was not implemented.
    Secondly, a serious style of criticism and self-criticism was not established. The above serious errors, of course, have many issues for which Du Yuan personally should be held responsible, but the Municipal Committee did not carry out serious criticism of Du Yuan, which also fostered his individualism and undisciplined errors.
    Thirdly, there was no establishment of a mass supervision system for the management and use of labor protection funds, nor was a labor protection fund review committee or other organization established, so that the labor protection department could arbitrarily spend and use the funds.
    Fourthly, the work of the labor protection department itself did not go deep into the lower levels to study the problems that needed to be urgently resolved in the labor protection work among the workers, but instead sat in the office busy running factories, issuing forms, approving notes, approving labor protection fees, etc., making the work passive and not understanding the hardships of the workers enough, so that the labor protection work could not be done well.
    In addition to conducting a review and requesting the superior trade union to impose punishment, the Municipal Committee expressed that it would definitely work hard to correct these issues in future work.

### 忽视劳保工作滥用劳保基金  天津纺织工会检讨错误

　　忽视劳保工作滥用劳保基金
    天津纺织工会检讨错误
    【本报讯】中国纺织工会天津市委会，对于一年来没有积极领导和推动中纺各厂开展劳保工作，以及在劳保金的保管和使用上发生了严重的错误进行了检讨。
    天津中纺各厂从去年五月起，即按月向该工会缴纳全部工资的百分之三的劳保费，作为劳保基金。但直至今年二月，该工会才公布并执行劳保条例；截至五月，仅开支劳保基金的百分之十三·六五，而结婚费用又占各项开支的百分之十七·一三。同时该工会将折合三百余万斤玉米面的基金存在银行里，使许多工人群众的困难不得解决，使国家的巨额资金遭受浪费。
    在劳保金的保管和使用上，错误就更严重。去年六月间正当物价波动时，该工会前生产部长杜远曾以劳保金二亿余元由皖北购回面粉，供给各厂职工。质量既低，价钱又高，引起工人很大不满。后来杜远又以经营面粉所赚的十万余斤玉米面开办酱油厂和鞋厂，作起买卖来；并将自己的亲戚朋友大批安插在厂内。因为经营不善，铺张浪费，半年内两厂共亏损玉米面三万余斤。杜又擅自挪用劳保金玉米面二万斤去补贴。此外，不经请示和报告，动用基金先后买房两所。这一切使工会威信大受影响。
    形成以上错误的原因，市委会认为首先是领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风。只有个人领导，缺乏严格的集体领导和健全的工作制度，因而不能及时的检查工作，总结经验。比如用劳保金开办两个工厂的问题，事先没有经过市委员会的讨论，事后也没有追究。在去年中国纺织工会全国代表会议后，虽然认识到劳保费不该经营工厂，当时并决定将工厂交到联社去经营，但结果并未执行。
    其次，是没有树立严肃的批评与自我批评的作风。以上的严重错误，当然有许多问题应由杜远个人负责，但市委会对杜远没有开展认真的批评，也助长了他的个人主义和无组织无纪律的错误。
    第三，对劳保金的保管和使用上，没有树立群众性的监督制度，也没有建立劳保金审查委员会等组织，以致劳保部任意开支使用。
    第四，劳保部工作本身，没有深入下层，研究职工群众中在劳保工作上急需解决的问题，而是坐在机关里忙于经营工厂，发表格，批条子，批劳保费等，使工作陷于被动，对工友疾苦不够了解，这样劳保工作也就作不好。
    市委会除进行检讨，要求上级工会予以处分外，并表示在今后工作中，一定努力纠正。
