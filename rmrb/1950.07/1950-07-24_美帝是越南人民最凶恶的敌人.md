American Imperialism is the Most Vicious Enemy of the Vietnamese People
    Wang Jingyao
    In his shameless statement on June 27th, U.S. President Truman, in addition to announcing armed intervention in the Korean civil war, armed aggression against China's Taiwan Province, and intensified aggression against the Philippines, also announced intensified aggression against Vietnam, to "accelerate the supply of military aid to the French and member states' forces in Indochina, and to send a military mission to establish close working relations with these forces." This means that U.S. imperialism will not only accelerate the supply of large quantities of deadly weapons to the French colonial army and the puppet Bảo Đại who are invading Vietnam, but will also send a military mission to directly control and command the bloody war against the Vietnamese people. Currently, a large number of American aggressors are arriving in Saigon to implement Truman's sinister plan.
    As everyone knows, Vietnam was originally a colony long enslaved and exploited by French imperialism. Since the end of World War II, France has carried out nearly five years of aggressive war against the Vietnamese people, and is still continuing this criminal war. The French colonialists are still the direct enemy of the Vietnamese people. However, France has increasingly become a vassal of U.S. imperialism since the war, and its war against Vietnam is supported by the United States. The French colonial army in Vietnam is increasingly becoming a mercenary force in the service of Wall Street, holding American weapons, commanded by Americans, and fighting for the interests of American monopoly capital. Therefore, U.S. imperialism has become the most vicious enemy of the Vietnamese people.
    Why does U.S. imperialism want to invade Vietnam? It is to plunder the rich resources of Vietnam and Southeast Asia, and to turn Vietnam into a military base for suppressing the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia. The New York Times, the mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalists, openly admitted this in a London dispatch published on February 11th this year. It said: "Indochina is an object worth betting on. The north has exportable tin, tungsten, zinc, manganese, coal, timber, and rice, while the south has rice, rubber, tea, pepper, livestock, hides, etc. Indochina and Burma are both rice-producing areas in Southeast Asia, and Indochina's pre-war rice exports were 1.5 million tons per year." It also said: "From a military point of view, Indochina is equally important. It is a land bridge between Communist China and British Malaya, and shares borders with Burma and Thailand. Haiphong and Saigon, the two major ports, are excellent bases." On February 27th this year, the Wall Street Journal, the organ of the U.S. monopoly capital group, stated even more bluntly: "U.S. aid to Indochina is a worthwhile gamble in the Cold War. The stakes in this adventure are tin, rubber, and oil (in the entire Southeast Asian region)...The task of aiding Indochina will be long-term, arduous, and costly, but if it can be successful, the expense is worthwhile."
    Therefore, U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is a deliberate and long-planned scheme. On the one hand, the United States supports the French imperialism's colonial war, attempting to strangle the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On the other hand, it is trying to squeeze the French imperialists out of Vietnam, just as it squeezed the British imperialists out of Greece and the Dutch imperialists out of Indonesia.

    Conspiracy and Trickery
    In August 1945, Japan was forced to surrender under the fierce attacks of the Soviet army. The Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Viet Minh, persisted in the heroic anti-Japanese struggle for five years and liberated most of the country. They held the great August Revolution and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2nd, gaining national liberation and national unity and independence. However, the Allied Headquarters controlled by MacArthur, the agent of U.S. imperialism, used the excuse of disarming the Japanese army and ordered the Japanese army to "maintain order," stubbornly resisting the surrender to the Vietnamese People's Army until British troops occupied the southern part of the Republic and the army of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries occupied the northern part of the Republic. Subsequently, the British army not only did not disarm the Japanese army, but used it to jointly help the French colonialists launch a war to reconquer the Vietnamese people. The army of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, used the Vietnamese reactionaries to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.
    In 1946, due to the growing strength of the Republic of Vietnam, the weakening of right-wing forces in France, and the gaining of advantage by the French Communist Party in Parliament, the French Gouin government was forced to sign the Hanoi Agreement with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 6, recognizing the Republic of Vietnam. But facts proved that the purpose of the French rulers in signing this agreement was only to buy time in order to prepare for a larger aggressive war. After the Bidault cabinet came to power, it launched a full-scale aggressive war against Vietnam in December 1946 with the encouragement of U.S. imperialism.
    At the same time, U.S. imperialism, through its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in China, colluded with the reactionary elements of the Tongmenghui and the Vietnamese Nationalist Party who participated in the Viet Minh, attempting to seize the leadership of the Republic from within. When political conspiracies failed, they resorted to military conspiracies. They organized reactionary armed forces on the Sino-Vietnamese border and launched open armed rebellions. After these reactionaries' conspiracies failed, they fled to Nanjing, Hong Kong, and other places, and continued to carry out activities to subvert the Republic under the protection of the US and Chiang.
    Under the resolute blows of the Vietnamese people, France's open armed aggression continued to suffer defeats, and the subversive activities instigated by the Kuomintang bandits within the Republic of Vietnam also failed. In view of this, U.S. imperialism came forward directly, creating the puppet government of Bảo Đại as its direct running dog to invade Vietnam.
    In September 1947 and February 1948, the U.S. State Department dispatched the notorious warmonger, former U.S. Ambassador to France William Bullitt, to Vietnam and Hong Kong to discuss with the French colonial authorities and the deposed King Bảo Đại "the issue of the role of the United States in the French-Vietnamese war," and decided to select Bảo Đại as a puppet. Under U.S. pressure, France finally signed the "French-Vietnamese Agreement" with Bảo Đại on March 8, 1949, creating the puppet government of Bảo Đại. Also under U.S. pressure, France "transferred sovereignty" to Bảo Đại in December 1949. This created the conditions for U.S. imperialism to directly invade Vietnam.

    Frenzied Aggression
    Faced with the great victory of the Chinese people, the rise of the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, and the corruption and incompetence of the French colonialists, U.S. imperialism has carried out a series of intense activities since the beginning of this year, stepping up its direct aggression against Vietnam. On the one hand, the United States believes that France "should not continue to control Vietnam," and pressured France to grant Bảo Đại so-called "genuine independence." On the other hand, it is eager to directly give military assistance to Bảo Đại, in order to completely turn Vietnam into its colony.
    In January of this year, U.S. State Department roving ambassador Jessup visited the Far East and specifically visited Bảo Đại, handing over a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Acheson to Bảo Đại, promising "assistance." In February, the United States, seeing that the Republic of Vietnam had successively established diplomatic relations with China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries, hurriedly announced its recognition of the Bảo Đại puppet government that it had created; and repeatedly coerced and lured Southeast Asian countries, calling on them to also recognize Bảo Đại. However, the fact that Bảo Đại is a puppet of U.S. and French imperialism is too obvious, and the Republic of Vietnam is so strong. Therefore, except for Thailand, no other country in Southeast Asia has dared to rashly recognize Bảo Đại until now.
    One of the results of the meeting of U.S. Far East diplomats in Bangkok in February was to determine to step up aggression against Vietnam. On March 6, a U.S. "special mission" arrived in Vietnam and began to formulate specific aggression plans. The head of this mission was Griffin, the former Deputy Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China branch, who had helped the Kuomintang bandits carry out counter-revolutionary civil war in China. Subsequently, the U.S. Seventh Fleet's aircraft carrier "Boxer" and two cruisers invaded Vietnamese territorial waters, sailed to Saigon, and 71 U.S. aircraft flew over Vietnamese airspace to conduct a "show of force" as a "gesture of support for Bảo Đại." But it aroused strong protests and demonstrations from the Vietnamese people. Vietnamese People's Guerrillas bombarded the American warships with mortars, and thousands of Vietnamese workers and students held powerful demonstrations, tearing up the American and French flags, and shouting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism and French colonial policy." As a result, the American warships were forced to flee in disgrace.
    Following Jessup's visit to Bảo Đại, American weapons were openly and directly shipped to Vietnam from bases in Okinawa, Guam, and the Philippines. According to statistics, by the end of January this year, MacArthur had directly shipped as much as 60 million US dollars worth of weapons to Vietnam and Indonesia from Japan. Since June, the United States has begun to ship a total of 30 million US dollars worth of weapons and ammunition to Vietnam, including airplanes, armored vehicles, automobiles, small arms, and naval and air force materials. Small arms will be used to enable Bảo Đại to "establish 25 battalions in seven months" of puppet troops, while naval and air force materials will be handed over to the French colonial army. Bloom, the head of the U.S. special economic mission to Vietnam, announced on June 6 that the U.S. "economic aid" to Indochina in the first year will reach 23 million U.S. dollars.
    In addition to helping Bảo Đại establish a puppet army, U.S. imperialism is also plotting to use former Japanese officers and soldiers to make a comeback as its mercenaries to invade Vietnam. Since last winter and spring, the United States has, through MacArthur, used Bảo Đại's uncle, Prince Cuong De, a pro-Japanese Vietnamese traitor who had lived in Japan for 45 years, to instruct him to collect remnants of Japanese fascist war criminals in Japan, to form a "Volunteer Army to Aid Vietnam," and set up a headquarters for the army in Tokyo. Prince Cuong De and his Japanese assistant, Major Takehiko Yamazaki, are now preparing to return to Vietnam. At the same time, MacArthur secretly instructed former Japanese General Iwakuro to organize a Japanese volunteer army, and stipulated that the Nikken, Fuji Sangyo and other munitions enterprises should be responsible for supplying weapons and equipment to Bảo Đại. MacArthur has also telegraphed former Japanese Commander-in-Chief of the occupying forces in Vietnam, General Tojo, now in Saigon, ordering him to contact Bảo Đại to discuss the organization of the Japanese volunteer army. In accordance with MacArthur's orders, the Japanese troops recruited to Vietnam will be given short-term training by American instructors.

    The Future of U.S. Imperialism's Aggression against Vietnam
    What is the future of U.S. imperialism's deliberate aggression against Vietnam? There is no doubt that the disastrous defeat that U.S. imperialism has already suffered in China is exactly its future in its aggression against Vietnam. As a result of five years of war by the French imperialists against Vietnam, they spent 630 billion francs, lost (killed, wounded, and captured) 150,000 troops, and now have 150,000 troops trapped in the quagmire of Vietnam, bearing a heavy military expenditure of more than one million US dollars per day. Despite this, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army has liberated more than 90% of the country. The Republic of Vietnam is growing stronger day by day. Hồ Chí Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, explained on July 16 the strong will and confidence of the Vietnamese people to defeat the French and American imperialists. He said that the strength of the Vietnamese people and the people of the other two parts of the Indochina Peninsula, Laos and Cambodia, united, "will surely be able to eliminate the French colonialists and American interventionists. American imperialists have been defeated in China. They will also be defeated in Vietnam. We will encounter many difficulties, but we are confident that we will win."

　　美帝是越南人民最凶恶的敌人
    王晶壵
    美国总统杜鲁门在六月二十七日的无耻声明中，除了宣布武装干涉朝鲜内战，武装侵略我国的台湾省和加紧侵略菲律宾以外，还同时宣布加紧侵略越南，要“加速以军事援助供给在印度支那的法国及成员国的部队，并派遣军事使团，以便与这些部队建立密切的工作关系”。这就是说，美帝国主义不仅要加紧以大批杀人的武器供给侵略越南的法国殖民军和傀儡保大，同时还要派遣军事使团去直接控制和指挥对越南人民的血腥战争。现在，大批美国侵略分子正源源抵达西贡，开始执行杜鲁门的这个罪恶计划。
    大家都知道，越南原来是法国帝国主义长期奴役剥削的殖民地。第二次世界大战结束以来，法国又对越南人民进行了将近五年的侵略战争，现在还正继续着这个罪恶的战争。法国殖民者目前仍然是越南人民的直接敌人。但是，法国在战后已日益沦为美帝国主义的附庸，它对越南的战争是美国所一手支持的。法国在越南的殖民军，正日益变为一只手拿美国武器、受美国人指挥、为美国独占资本的利益作战的华尔街的雇佣军。因此，美帝国主义已成为越南人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义为什么要侵略越南呢？是为了要掠夺越南的和东南亚的丰富资源，将越南变为镇压东南亚民族解放运动的军事基地。美国独占资本家的喉舌纽约时报今年二月十一日所发表的一篇伦敦通讯，公开承认了这一点。它说：“印度支那是值得大赌一下的对象。北部有可以输出的锡、钨、锌、锰、煤、木材和大米，南部有米、橡胶、茶叶、胡椒、牲畜、牛羊皮等等。印度支那和缅甸同是东南亚的产米区，印度支那战前米的出口量是每年一百五十万吨。”它又说：“从军事观点来看，印度支那也是同等重要的，它是位于共产党中国与英属马来亚之间的陆地桥梁，而与缅甸和泰国有共同的边界。海防和西贡这两个主要港口是绝好的基地。”今年二月二十七日，美国独占资本集团的机关报《华尔街日报》更直截了当地说：“美国对印度支那的援助，是冷战中一个值得的冒险。这个冒险的赌注，是（整个东南亚地区的）锡、橡胶和石油。……援助印度支那的任务将是长期的、艰苦的和费钱的，但是如果能够成功的话，这笔开支是值得的。”
    因此，美帝国主义对越南的侵略，是处心积虑、蓄谋已久了的计划。美国一面支持法帝国主义的殖民战争，企图绞杀年青的越南民主共和国，一面又力图把法帝国主义者从越南排挤出去，正如同它在希腊把英帝国主义，在印尼把荷兰帝国主义排挤出去一样。
    阴谋诡计
    一九四五年八月，日本在苏军的猛烈打击下被迫投降，在越盟领导下坚持了五年英勇抗日斗争，并解放了绝大部分国土的越南人民，举行了伟大的八月革命，并于九月二日成立了越南民主共和国，获得了民族解放和国家的统一独立。但是，美帝国主义的代理人麦克阿瑟所控制的盟军总部，却借口要解除日军武装，命令日军“维持秩序”，顽强抵抗越南人民军的受降，直到英国军队占领了共和国的南部、中国国民党反动派的军队占领了共和国的北部。随后，英军不但不解除日军武装，反而利用它共同帮助法国殖民者发动了重新征服越南人民的战争。而美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派的军队则利用越南反动派，进行反革命的活动。
    一九四六年，由于越南共和国日益壮大，法国国内右派势力日益削弱，法国共产党在议会中取得优势，法国古恩内阁被迫在三月六日和越南民主共和国签订了河内协定，承认了越南共和国。但事实证明，法国统治者签订这个协定的目的，只是在于争取时间，以便准备更大的侵略战争。皮杜尔内阁上台后，便在美帝国主义的鼓励下，于一九四六年十二月发动了对越南的全面侵略战争。
    与此同时，美帝国主义又通过它在中国的走狗蒋介石，勾结参加越盟的同盟会与越南国民党中的反动分子，企图从内部夺取共和国的领导权，政治阴谋不成，就进行军事阴谋。他们在中越边境组织反动武装，发动公开的武装叛变。这些反动分子们阴谋失败后，就逃到南京、香港等地，在美蒋的庇护下继续进行颠覆共和国的活动。
    在越南人民的坚决打击下，法国公然的武装侵略不断遭受失败，国民党匪帮在越南共和国内部策动的颠覆活动也失败了。有鉴于此，美帝国主义就直接出面，进行制造保大傀儡政府，作为它侵略越南的直接走狗。
    一九四七年九月和一九四八年二月，美国国务院派遣臭名远扬的战争贩子、美国前驻法大使布立特到越南和香港，与法国殖民当局和逊王保大商谈，“研究美国在法越战争中的作用问题”，并决定挑选保大作为傀儡。在美国的压力下，法国终于在一九四九年三月八日和保大签订了“法越协定”，制造了保大傀儡政府。同时也在美国的压力下，法国并在一九四九年十二月向保大“移交主权”。这就造成了美帝国主义直接侵入越南的条件。
    疯狂的侵略
    面对着中国人民的伟大胜利、东南亚民族解放运动的高涨，和法国殖民者的腐朽无能，美帝国主义从今年年初以来，进行了一连串的紧张活动，加紧对越南的直接侵略。美国一方面认为法国“不应继续控制越南”，压迫法国给予保大所谓“真正的独立”，一方面急图以军事援助直接交给保大，以便完全变越南为其殖民地。
    今年一月，美国国务院巡回大使耶塞普到远东活动时，特别访问了保大，并将美国国务卿艾奇逊的信件交给保大，允诺予以“援助”。二月间，美国鉴于越南共和国连续和中国、苏联及各人民民主国家建立了外交关系，就慌忙宣布承认它一手所制造出来的保大傀儡政府；并对东南亚各国一再进行威逼利诱，叫它们也承认保大。但是，保大是美法帝国主义的傀儡这个事实是太明显了，而越南共和国又如此强大。因此，除了泰国一国以外，直到现在东南亚还没有第二个国家敢于贸然承认保大。
    美国远东外交人员二月间在曼谷举行会议的结果之一，是确定加紧侵略越南。三月六日，美国的一个“特别使团”到达越南，着手制订具体侵略计划。这个使团的团长，是曾在中国帮助国民党匪帮进行反革命内战的前美国经合总署中国分署副署长葛里芬。随后，美国第七舰队的“拳师”号航空母舰和两艘巡洋舰侵入越南领海，开到西贡，并有七十一架美国飞机在越南领空飞行，进行“武力示威”，作为“支持保大的姿态”。但却引起了越南人民强烈的抗议示威。越南人民游击队以迫击炮轰击美国军舰，数千越南的工人和学生举行了强大示威，撕毁了美国和法国国旗，并高呼“打倒美帝国主义和法国的殖民政策”的口号。结果，美国军舰被迫狼狈而逃。
    随着耶塞普访问保大之后，美国武器就从冲绳、关岛及菲律宾等基地公开地直接运往越南。据统计，到今年一月底止，仅是麦克阿瑟从日本直接运往越南和印尼的武器，即有六千万美元之多。从六月份起，美国又开始将总数达三千万美元的武器和军火运往越南，其中包括飞机、装甲车、汽车、小型武器及海空军物资。小型武器将用来使保大“在七个月中建立二十五个营”的傀儡军，海空军物资则交给法国殖民军。而美国驻越南特别经济使团团长布鲁姆六月六日又宣布：美国对印度支那第一年的“经济援助”将达二千三百万美元。
    美帝国主义除了帮助保大建立傀儡军之外，而且还阴谋利用前日本官兵卷土重来，作为它侵略越南的雇佣军。自去冬今春以来，美国即通过麦克阿瑟，利用留居日本四十五年的亲日派越奸、保大的皇叔强诋亲王，指使他在日本搜罗日本法西斯战犯余孽，筹组“援越志愿军”，并在东京设立了组军总部。强诋亲王和他的日本助手山崎武彦少佐，现正在准备返回越南。同时，麦克阿瑟又秘密指使前日军岩畔中将筹组日本志愿军，并规定由日建、富士产业等军火企业负责给保大供给武器与装备。麦克阿瑟并已致电现在西贡的前日本在越占领军总司令土桥中将，命令他与保大联络，商谈组织日本志愿军问题。遵照麦克阿瑟的命令，被征募赴越的日军都由美国教官进行短期训练。
    美帝侵略越南的前途
    美帝国主义如此处心积虑侵略越南的前途怎样呢？毫无疑问，美帝国主义在中国所已经遭受的惨败，就正是它侵略越南的前途。法国帝国主义者对越南进行五年战争的结果，花费了六千三百亿法郎，损失了（毙伤及被俘的）十五万人的兵力，现在又有十五万军队陷在越南的泥沼里，每天要负担一百多万美元的沉重军费。尽管如此，越南人民解放军还是解放了百分之九十以上的国土。越南共和国正日益壮大。越南民主共和国主席胡志明在七月十六日说明了越南人民击败法美帝国主义的坚强的意志和信心。他说：越南人民和印度支那半岛上另两部分老挝与柬埔寨人民联合起来的力量，“一定能够消灭法国殖民者与美国干涉者。美帝国主义者已在中国遭到失败。他们在越南也将被击败。我们会遇到很多的困难，但是我们确信一定会获得胜利。”
