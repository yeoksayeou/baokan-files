　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th. The patriotic workers and farmers of North Korea are extremely angry at the bestial acts of the American imperialist bandits who have been bombing peaceful cities and villages and slaughtering innocent residents for days. They express their determination to turn this anger into strength to support the People's Army on the front lines and defeat the aggressors as soon as possible. Workers, staff, and technicians are constantly increasing the quantity and quality of their products to ensure supplies for the front lines. Workers at the Hwanghae Iron Works have increased the production of thin plates to twice the pre-war level, and the production of major materials such as iron wire and crude steel has increased by 30% to 50% compared to pre-war levels. The production volume of many factories, such as the Tiannae-ri Cement Factory in South Pyongan Province, the Sinuiju Paper Mill in North Pyongan Province, and the Sariwon Textile Factory in Hwanghae Province, has increased by 20% to 40% compared to pre-war levels.
    To ensure that the front lines have sufficient grain, North Korean farmers, under the slogan "Pay Well, Pay Quickly," are competing to pay taxes in kind (wheat) from early crops to the government. Farmers in the Daewon District of An'ak County, Hwanghae Province, held a rally on July 7th, and after deciding to hand over the best wheat to the government, completed all payments on the 9th. Farmers in Kangdong County, South Pyongan Province, completed all payments of taxes in kind in early July, half a month earlier than last year.

　　朝鲜人民热烈支援前线
    北部农民争先缴现物税
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】热爱祖国的北朝鲜的工人和农民，对美帝国主义强盗连日轰炸和平城市与农村，屠杀无辜居民的兽行，极为愤怒。他们表示决心将这种愤怒变成力量，支援前线人民军，早日击退侵略者。工人、职员、技师们正在不断地提高产品的数量和质量，以保障前线的供给。黄海制铁所的工人，将薄板的生产提高到战前的两倍，铁丝与粗钢等主要物资的生产提高到战前的百分之三十至五十。平安南道的天内里洋灰工厂、平安北道的新义州造纸厂、黄海道的沙里院纺织厂等许多工厂的生产量，均比战前提高了百分之二十至四十。
    北朝鲜的农民为保证前线有充足的粮食，他们在“缴得好、缴得快”的口号下，争先向政府缴纳早期作物（麦类）的现物税。黄海道安岳县大远区的农民于七月七日召开了奋起大会，决定以最好的麦类交给政府后，并于九日全部缴纳完毕。平安南道江东县的农民比去年早半个月于七月初即已将现物税全部缴纳全毕。
