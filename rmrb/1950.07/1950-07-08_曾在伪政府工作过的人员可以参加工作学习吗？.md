　　Can People Who Worked in Puppet Governments Participate in Work and Study?
To the Editor:
    I have two questions I don't understand, please answer: If people who worked in puppet governments in the past are willing to sincerely repent and want to participate in study or work, can the district people's government write a letter of introduction for them? Also, are past academic credentials still valid?
    Wang Ximing

    Mr. Wang Ximing:
    Your questions have been answered by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau as follows:

    In the spirit of the lenient policy of the People's Government, those who have worked in puppet governments are given the opportunity to start anew. When various agencies, schools, and organizations recruit personnel, they can only participate in registration and application after the people's government at the district level or above writes a letter of introduction. The district government must adopt a serious attitude responsible to the country and the people when writing letters of introduction, and must understand the person being introduced before writing a letter of certification. Therefore, people applying for a letter of introduction must first hold a letter of certification from the local police station or village government where they live, and go to the district office in person. If, after review, they are deemed to have no political problems, they can be accepted for processing. As for past academic qualifications and credentials, they are also a kind of historical proof and still have reference value when applying for exams and recruitment, but the main thing is to look at their actual conditions to decide whether to accept them and appropriately assign them to work or study.

　　曾在伪政府工作过的人员可以参加工作学习吗？编辑同志：
    我有两个问题不明白，请解答：以往曾在伪政府工作过的人员，他肯诚心改悔，并想参加学习或工作，区人民政府是不是可以给写介绍信？又以往的学资证件是否适用？
    王希明
    王希明君：
    你的问题已经北京市人民政府民政局答复如下：
    曾在伪政府工作过的人员，人民政府本宽大政策的精神，是给予自新机会的。各机关、学校、团体在招考人员时，由区级以上的人民政府开写介绍信始能参加报名投考。而区政府开写介绍信时要采取对国家对人民负责的严肃态度，必须对被介绍者了解后，才能写证明信。因此申请开介绍信的人，必先持自己所住地区的公安派出所或村政府的证明信件，亲赴区公所，经审查认为无政治问题者，可以接受办理。至于过去学历资历证件，也是一种历史的证明，在投考应征时仍有参阅的价值，但主要的还要看他本人的实际条件，决定取舍并适当地分配工作或学习。
