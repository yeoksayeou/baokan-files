　　The Forces of Peace Must Be Displayed to Demonstrate Against the Aggressors

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The propaganda movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea is continuing to unfold in Beijing's state-owned factories. The Beijing Machine General Factory's Trade Union, on the evening of the 24th, used its spare time to send propaganda teams to the Beixinqiao and Dongsi areas to conduct propaganda. The propaganda team included a waist drum team and a broadcasting group, carrying large red flags and holding cartoons and maps of the Korean War of Liberation's situation. They were warmly welcomed by the citizens wherever they went. When the broadcasting group broadcasted that the American soldiers were repeatedly defeated in Korea, many onlookers immediately burst into loud applause, and some even cheered loudly. Shopkeepers on both sides of the street were very moved to see how hard the propagandists worked, and they took the initiative to prepare tea. The owner of the Xianghe Electrical Appliance Store on Chaonei Street said: "You are coming out to promote awareness, to help everyone understand the U.S. imperialists' criminal acts of aggression. My preparing some tea for you is also helping with the propaganda!" The propagandists were all covered in sweat, but their spirits were still very high. For example, the worker Gao Yanchang lost his voice from shouting, and when others told him to take a rest, he said, "It doesn't matter if I'm a little tired, it's a great gain that the broad masses of people know about the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression!" (Yu Shuyan, Miao Jun)

　　The Beijing Machine Factory No. 2 Branch held a forum on the 22nd to oppose American aggression. Worker Tian Jichun said: The U.S. launching a war of aggression against Korea is inviting its own destruction. Because the American soldiers who were deceived into fighting in Korea will not be able to fight well; and the Korean People's Army is very brave because they are fighting for the liberation of their own people. This is just like how our workers were unwilling to work well before liberation due to the oppression of the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang; after liberation, because we are working for ourselves, we naturally work desperately, it is the same principle. Wang Tingjie said: Chairman Mao told us that the U.S. imperialists are a paper tiger, and this is clearly seen this time. The Korean people beat it until its head was bleeding. We must actively publicize this and prevent spies from spreading rumors and sabotage. Young worker Zhang Xi said: We must use practical actions of working hard to learn technology and increase production to support the Korean people and the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. The people who spoke at the meeting were very enthusiastic. The factory also published a special issue on the 24th against American aggression, exposing the American conspiracy of aggression from all aspects, and explaining the reason why the Korean people will inevitably achieve liberation. (Li Honggang, Wang Tingjie)

　　The Yanjing Paper Mill held a forum on the evening of the 27th. After a day of intense work, the workers' emotions were still very high, and everyone was eager to express their opinions against the U.S. imperialist aggression in Korea and Taiwan. Ironworker Shi Wanqing said: The U.S. aggression in Korea is its death throes. The U.S. imperialists are the enemy of the whole world, but it is like suffering from dropsy, the posture is large, but the internal organs have long been rotten. As long as the people of the world who love peace and democracy actively work hard to strengthen themselves, they will definitely be able to stop its aggression. Accountant Li Jie, after explaining the reasons for the U.S. imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, then called on everyone: In order to show our determination to oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression, everyone in the factory must stick to their posts, work hard to produce, and especially pay attention to fire prevention, theft prevention, and spy prevention. Worker Sun Wenhui more vividly explained the importance of peace for everyone. He said: We are peace-loving young soldiers. Because peace guarantees our lives, property, and the progress of the entire society. The Chinese people's many years of cruel struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries have made us know the value of peace, and also discovered the greed and shamelessness of imperialism. We can only effectively maintain world peace by raising our vigilance, preventing enemy sabotage; working hard to produce, and increasing the strength of the people and the country. Many speakers especially pointed out: Such meetings are being held in every corner of the world, this is the working class's demonstration to the imperialists!

　　The employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau expressed great anger at the U.S. imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, and are very concerned about the victory of the Korean People's Army. Slogans, cartoons, and maps of the Korean War situation are posted in all units of the bureau. As soon as the employees get off work, they rush to see the Korean war reports on the blackboard newspaper. Liu Dechang, the model squad leader of the reporting section, said after reading it: We must warn all war-mongers: if you want to launch a war, you are inviting your own destruction. The employees of the accounting section, accounting section, and long-distance station of the bureau's third branch have all proposed to express their determination to oppose American aggression by doing a good job in production competitions. (Cao Yali)

　　The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory held a mass rally on the 23rd against American aggression. After the chairman of the factory's trade union analyzed the major events at home and abroad and the situation of the Korean War to everyone, the workers' emotions were very high. The rolling mill department, which won the Red Flag Award, took the lead in writing a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing that in order to support the Korean brothers and the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, they guaranteed to complete the production task for July ahead of schedule. When the workers were very excited, they sang the majestic song "Production is like going to the battlefield, completing the task and fighting against the American Chiang." Engineer Feng Xiqian firmly said at the meeting to everyone: As long as we work hard to build a new China and put out the forces of peace, the American imperialists will tremble in front of us!

　　各公营工厂运动逐渐深入
    到处贴着标语漫画和朝鲜形势地图
    要把和平力量摆出来向侵略者示威
    【本报讯】京市各公营工厂继续展开反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜的宣传运动。北京机器总厂职工会，于二十四日晚利用空闲时间，出动宣传队到北新桥和东四一带进行宣传。宣传队中有腰鼓队和广播小组，打着大红旗，拿着漫画和朝鲜解放战争的形势图。他们每到一处，都受到市民的热烈欢迎，当广播组广播到美国兵在朝鲜连吃败仗的时候，许多围观的人立刻鼓起响亮的掌声，有的还高声欢呼。街道两旁的商户看到宣传的人非常辛苦，都很感动，纷纷自动准备茶水。朝内大街祥和电料行掌柜说：“你们出来宣传，是为了帮助大家知道美帝侵略的罪恶行为。我为你们预备一点茶水，也是帮助宣传！”宣传员们都累得满身大汗，但情绪仍很高。如工人高延昌把嗓子喊哑了，别人让他休息一下，他说：“我累一点不要紧，广大人民知道了美帝的侵略行为，是多么大的收获呀！”                                          （于树延、苗俊）
    北京机器二分厂于二十二日召开了反对美国侵略座谈会。工人田际春说：美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争是自取灭亡。因为受骗到朝鲜作战的美国兵，是不可能好好地打仗的；而朝鲜人民军由于他们是为自己的人民解放而打仗，所以都非常勇敢。这就好象我们工人解放前受美帝和国民党的压迫，就不愿好好干活；解放后，因为我们是为自己干活，自然就拚命工作，是一样的道理。王廷杰说：毛主席告诉我们，美帝是一只纸老虎，这次就明显的看出来了。朝鲜人民把它打得头破血流。我们一定要积极宣传，并要防止特务的造谣破坏。青年工人张锡说：我们要拿努力学习技术和增加生产的实际行动，来支援朝鲜人民和人民解放军解放台湾。会上发言的人非常踊跃。该厂并在二十四日，出了一期反对美国侵略的专刊，从各方面揭露了美国的侵略阴谋，说明了朝鲜人民必然获得解放的道理。                                  （李鸿刚、王廷杰）
    燕京造纸厂在二十七日晚召开了座谈会。工人们在一天紧张的工作之后，情绪仍十分高涨，大家都争先恐后地说出了反对美帝侵略朝鲜台湾的意见。铁工石万青说：美国侵略朝鲜的战争，是它垂死前的挣扎。美帝是全世界的敌人，但它好象得了臌胀病的一样，架势虽大，可是五脏早已腐烂了。只要全世界爱好和平民主的人民，积极努力，壮大自己，就一定能够制止它的侵略。会计李杰，在说明了美帝侵略台湾朝鲜的原因后，接着号召大家说：为了表示我们反对美帝侵略的决心，全厂每一个人一定要坚守岗位，努力生产，特别是要注意防火、防盗和防特。工人孙文辉更特别生动地说明了和平对于每一个人的重要性。他说：我们是爱好和平的青年战士。因为和平保障了我们的生命财产和整个社会的进步。中国人民多年同帝国主义和国民党反动派的残酷斗争，使我们知道和平的可贵，也发现了帝国主义的贪馋无耻。我们只有提高警惕，防止敌特的破坏；努力生产，增加人民国家的力量，才能有效的维护世界和平。许多发言的人，都特别指出：全世界各个角落都正在召开着这样的会议，这是工人阶级向帝国主义者的示威！
    北京电信局的职工，对于美帝侵略台湾朝鲜表示十分愤恨，对于朝鲜人民军的胜利则十分关心。该局各单位贴满标语漫画和朝鲜战争形势图。职工们一下班就争着去看黑板报上的朝鲜战报。报务科模范班长刘德昌看后说：我们要警告一切战争贩子：你们要发动战争，就是自取灭亡。该局三分局会计科，帐务科和长途台的职工们，均提出要以搞好生产竞赛，来表示反对美国侵略的决心。                           
            （曹亚力）
    华北农业机械总厂在二十三日召开了反对美国侵略的群众大会。该厂工会主任向大家分析了国内外大事和朝鲜战争的形势后，工人的情绪十分高昂。获得红旗奖的轧钢部，首先发起写信给毛主席，表示为了支援朝鲜兄弟和人民解放军解放台湾，保证提前完成七月份的生产任务。工人们在感情十分激动的时候，就高唱着“生产好比上战场，完成任务打美蒋。”的雄壮歌曲。工程师冯希谦坚定地在会上向大家说：我们只要努力建设新中国，把和平力量摆出来，美帝国主义者就会在我们的面前发抖！
