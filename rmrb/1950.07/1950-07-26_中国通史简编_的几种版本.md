　　Several Versions of "A Concise History of China"
　　Rong Mengyuan
　　"A Concise History of China," compiled by the Chinese History Research Association under the leadership of Comrade Fan Wenlan, was published by the Xinhua Bookstore in Yan'an, with the first volume in September 1941 and the second volume in December 1942. Subsequently, it was reprinted in many places. In 1948, the History Research Office of North China University, under the leadership of Comrade Fan Wenlan, revised it once, and the revised edition was published by the North China Xinhua Bookstore (two volumes, hardcover). When it was published by the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore in September 1949, it was re-proofread and slightly modified.
　　The revised edition published by the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore in September 1949 (three volumes, paperback), compared with the original Yan'an edition, has the following key revisions:
　　First, the revised edition added two articles, "The Key to Studying Three Thousand Years of Chinese History" and "On Legitimacy," which are of great value for learning historical science's viewpoints, positions, and methods. The revised edition also added a chronology, briefly marking the Gregorian calendar, reign titles, emperor names, and imperial titles for easy reference, which is very convenient for readers.
　　Second, the entire book is divided into three parts, and the three major titles have been revised:
			Original Edition
	First Part	From Primitive Commune to the Establishment of a Centralized Feudal System
	Second Part	After the Establishment of a Centralized Feudal State, External Aggression to Internal Invasion by Foreign Races
	Third Part	The Development of Feudal Economy to the Invasion of Western Capitalism
			Revised Edition
	From Primitive Commune to the Establishment of a Centralized National State
	After the Establishment of a Nationally Unified Centralized Feudal State, External Expansion to Internal Invasion by Foreign Races
	The Spiral-like Continued Development of Feudal Society to the Invasion of Western Capitalism.
　　Of the book's twenty-two chapters, the titles of eight chapters have been revised. The subheadings of each chapter's sections have also been revised in many places. For example, in the original edition, the titles of Chapters 4 and 7 in Part 3 are both "The Era of Feudal Economic Revival," while in the revised edition, Chapter 4 is changed to "The Era of Further Development of the Domestically Unified Feudal System," and Chapter 7 is "The Era of Higher Development of the Feudal System." From the titles of the parts and chapters, the overview of China's social development is much clearer in the revised edition than in the original edition. Also, for example, in the original edition, the title of Section 3, Chapter 1, Part 1, is "The Yellow Emperor and His Descendants," while in the revised edition, it is changed to "Legends about the Yellow Emperor and His Descendants"; in the original edition, the title of Section 5, Chapter 4 of the same part, is "Struggles between Races," while in the revised edition, it is changed to "Struggles between Ethnic Groups"; obviously, the revised titles are more precise and scientific.
　　Third, there were some printing errors in the original Yan'an edition. For example, in Section 2, Chapter 1, Part 3, "Rouran (蠕蠕)" was mistakenly written as "Rouran, 蠕蠕"; in Section 3 of the same chapter, "Chiping County" in Shandong was mistakenly written as "茌平县"; in Section 4, Chapter 9, Part 3, the English name of the British East India Fleet Commander Maitland, "Maitland," was mistakenly written as "Maileand"; in Section 6 of the same section, "the essence of British so-called free trade" was mistakenly written as "the nature of British so-called free trade"; in Section 4, Chapter 9, Part 3, Luoshu, the upper right corner "●—●" was mistakenly written as "●". All these kinds of errors have been corrected in the revised edition.
　　Fourth, in the original edition, emperors were generally referred to by their names, not by their posthumous or temple titles; however, the emperors and feudal lords of the Zhou Dynasty were all referred to by their posthumous titles, which was inconsistent with the style of the entire book. In the original edition, some reign titles were marked with the Gregorian calendar, while others were not, which was also inconsistent in style, and some Gregorian calendar years were even marked incorrectly. For example, the eighteenth year of Shunzhi should be 1661, but it was mistakenly written as "1864" (Section 2, Chapter 8, Part 3); and the thirteenth year of Zhengde should be 1518, but it was mistakenly written as "1519." The revised edition refers to all emperors and feudal lords directly by their names; deletes the Gregorian calendar in the main text and uses the Gregorian calendar in the chronology, correcting the errors in the original edition.
　　Fifth, some historical facts were mistaken in the original edition. For example, Section 4, Chapter 7, Part 3, in the section on industry, based on "Li Shizhen's 'Compendium of Materia Medica' does not mention fire wells," it was said that "the utilization of fire wells in Linqiong County, Sichuan, probably began in the late Ming Dynasty," which is incorrect. The revised edition, based on "Annotations to the Book of Later Han, Treatise on the States and Kingdoms," changed it to "The people of Sichuan used fire wells to boil salt, which began in the Eastern Han Dynasty" (Section 2, Chapter 2, Part 2). Another example is Section 1, Chapter 7, Part 3, which said: "Zhu Jixuan had one hundred sons, ... Zhu Qizhen, a great-grandson of Jixuan, had seventy sons," which is incorrect. The revised edition changed it to "Zhu Jixuan was conferred as Prince Qingcheng, and his great-grandson Zhu Qi had ninety-four children (one saying he had one hundred sons)."
　　Sixth, some issues were not clearly described in the original edition. In the revised edition, many additions were made. For example, the original edition's descriptions of the thoughts of Mozi, Laozi, Xunzi, and Han Fei, the reasons for Qin Shihuang's unification of the six kingdoms, the reasons for the Huang Chao uprising and its failure, etc., were not clear enough; and more detailed supplements were made in the revised edition. For example, Section 3, Chapter 4, Part 3 of the original edition, which discusses the economic process of the Northern Song Dynasty, neglects the main production sector at that time—agriculture. Therefore, the revised edition specially added a section on agriculture, explaining the reasons for the economic development of the Northern Song Dynasty and the specific situation of the development of water conservancy, land reclamation, and agricultural technology.
　　Seventh, some issues were inappropriately presented in the original edition, and many corrections were made in the revised edition. For example, regarding the "construction of the Great Wall," the original edition only said: "The Great Wall is one of the famous ancient projects in the world," while neglecting the relationship between the Great Wall and China's production, which is inappropriate. The revised edition changed it to: "From the Qin Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall played a role in preventing nomadic peoples from the north from invading the Central Plains"; Qin Dynasty's "developing water conservancy, repairing highways, demolishing old Great Walls, building the Great Wall, and conquering Hu and Yue, all contained the significance of promoting production; however, at that time, the people did not have much savings, and the expenditure of such large manpower and material resources was unbearable for the people," which is more appropriate. Another example is the Wang Mang Reform. The original edition said: "Wang Mang's bizarre behavior is rare in history. He seems to be a neurotic, a wizard, and also a learned Confucian scholar who loves antiquity... He could not solve the fundamental problems of the time but instead promoted peasant uprisings." Such an emphasis on the "bizarre" aspect, neglecting the analysis of class relations, is an inappropriate formulation. The revised edition deleted the forty-four characters following "Wang Mang's bizarre behavior" and changed the last sentence to: Wang Mang's reforms "could not solve the fundamental problems of the time but deepened the people's suffering. The peasant uprising matured, and the aristocratic landlords also wanted to participate in this uprising. Wang Mang became a tyrant. Wang Mang, who attempted to solve the problem, became Wang Mang, who was solved by the problem." Analyzing Wang Mang's reforms and the reasons for his failure from the perspective of class relations and class struggle is more appropriate and correct.
　　Currently, when discussing the versions of "A Concise History of China," the revised edition published by the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore in September 1949 (i.e., the paperback three-volume edition) is, of course, the best. The second best is the revised edition published by the North China Xinhua Bookstore in 1948 (i.e., the hardcover two-volume edition). As for the original Yan'an edition, it is an outdated item and should no longer be used. Other old versions from Xinhua Bookstores in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Northeast, and various liberated areas, as well as old versions from Xinzhi Bookstore, New China Bookstore, and the "Shanghai First Edition" published by Sanlian Bookstore in Shanghai in July 1949, are all reprinted based on the original Yan'an edition. Naturally, these versions fully retain all the errors of the original Yan'an edition, and with each additional printing, more typos are added. For example, the Sanlian Bookstore edition mistakenly wrote "Yang Zhenlong, a resident of Taizhou, revolted in Yushan" as "Yang Zhenlong, a resident of Taizhou, revolted in Wangshan" (page 499, line 7); the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Xinhua Bookstore edition mistakenly wrote "Gu Yanwu was a native of Kunshan County, Jiangsu" as "Gu Yanwu was a native of Kun County, Jiangsu" (volume 6, page 666, line 15); these are even more erroneous than the original Yan'an edition, and they are even more unusable.
　　The so-called "best" revised edition is in comparison to other versions; as for the revised edition itself, shortcomings still exist. First, there are still many typos. For example, "Emperor Xizong of Tang" is mistakenly written as "Emperor Xizong of Tang" (page 589); "three refinements into copper," "obtaining one catty of copper," and "new method of obtaining copper" are mistakenly written as "three refinements into steel," "obtaining one catty of steel," and "new method of obtaining steel" (page 791), etc., but these are only one or two examples. Second, some historical facts are worth reconsidering. For example, when describing Zhang Xianzhong, it is certainly stated that "the historical records say that Xianzhong's cruel killings are not very credible"; however, it still narrates based on the "historical records" and does not narrate the fact that Zhang Xianzhong's military discipline was strict (see the "Stone Inscription of Liu, Director of the Dasxi Jun Cavalry Camp"). Another example is when describing the prohibition of Catholic missionaries in the early years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, it only says: "The Pope strictly prohibited Chinese Catholics from worshiping ancestors, and Xuan Ye was angry," and the Manchu Qing government "strictly maintained its consistent policy of maritime prohibition and seclusion"; this explanation is not enough, because based on the historical facts recorded by the Catholic Church, compared with a more specific narrative, there are more reasons for the rejection of Catholicism in China, such as the fact that foreign missionaries secretly sent Chinese maps to Europe, which was also a reason for angering the Chinese people. Third, in some places, the theoretical analysis is not clear enough. For example, the early years of the Western Zhou Dynasty, when Chinese history began to embark on the feudal system, should be described and analyzed in detail; however, the book does not use much of the materials in historical records and underground excavations, and even less analysis. It is really not enough to use only more than a thousand words to describe the "production mode in the early Zhou Dynasty"—the production mode in the early period of the three thousand years of the Chinese feudal system.

　　“中国通史简编”的几种版本
    荣孟源
    中国历史研究会编著的《中国通史简编》，由范文澜同志领导编成，上册于一九四一年九月，中册于一九四二年十二月，先后在延安新华书店出版。随后，各地多有翻印。一九四八年北方大学历史研究室在范文澜同志领导下校订一次，订正本由华北新华书店出版（布面精装两册）。一九四九年九月北京新华书店出版时，又重新校对一次，且小有修改。
    一九四九年北京新华书店出版的订正本（平装三册），与延安初版本对照看来，其订正的要点如左。
    一，订正本增加了“研究中国三千年历史的钥匙”和“论正统”两篇文章，对于学习历史科学的观点、立场、方法颇有价值。订正本又增加了年表，将公历、年号、帝王姓名和帝号都扼要标明，以便检查，对于读者是很方便的。
    二，全书分三编，三个大标题，都有所订正：
            初版本
    第一编  原始公社到中央集权的封建制度的成立
    第二编  中央集权的封建国家成立后对外侵略到外族的内侵
    第三编  封建经济的发展到西洋资本主义的侵入
            订正本
    原始公社到中央集权的民族国家的成立
    民族统一的中央集权的封建国家成立后对外扩张到外族的内侵
    封建制度社会螺旋式的继续发展到西洋资本主义的侵入。
    全书二十二章，其中八章的标题有所订正。每章分若干节，每节的小标题也多有订正。如初版本第三编第四章与第七章，标题都是“封建经济复兴时代”，订正本则改为第四章是“国内统一封建制度进一步发展时代”，第七章是“封建制度更高发展时代”。从编和章的标题中，观察中国社会发展的概况，订正本比较初版本清楚多了。又如第一编第一章第三节，初版本标题是“黄帝及其后裔”，订正本改为“关于黄帝及其后裔的传说”；同编第四章第五节，初版本标题是“种族间的斗争”，订正本改为“民族间的斗争”；显然经过订正的标题，是比较精确，比较科学的。
    三，延安初版本，有一些印错的地方，如第三编第一章第二节，把“柔然（蠕蠕）”，误为“柔然、蠕蠕”；同章第三节，把山东“茌平县”，误为“茌平县”；第三编第八章第九节四，把英国东印度舰队司令梅脱兰德的英文名字“Maitland”，误为“Maileand”；同节六，把“英国所谓自由贸易的本质”，误为“英国所谓自由贸易的本性”；第三编第九章第四节洛书，把右上角的“●—●”，误为“●”。这一类的错误，在订正本中都改正了。
    四，初版本对于帝王，一般都称其姓名，不用谥号或庙号；但对于周朝的帝王和诸侯，却都称谥号，这在全书体例上说来是不统一的。初版本在所用的年号之下，有的注明公历，有的未注公历，这在体例上说来也是不统一的，而且公历年数有的还注错了。如顺治十八年应是公历一八六一年，却误为“一八六四年”（第三编第八章第二节八）；又如正德十三年应是一五一八年，却误为“一五一九年”。订正本对于一切帝王诸侯，都直称本名；在正文中删去公历，而在年表中以公历纪年，纠正了初版本中的错误。
    五，初版本中弄错了一些史实。如第三编第七章第四节工业一段，根据“李时珍撰《本草纲目》，还没有说到火井”，就说，四川临邛县“大概火井利用在明朝末年”，是错误的。订正本根据“续汉书郡国志注”，改为“四川人用火井煮盐，东汉时已经开始”（第二编第二章第二节）。又如第三编第七章第一节说：“朱济炫生子一百人，………济炫曾孙朱奇浈又生子七十人”，是错误的。订正本改为“朱济炫封庆成王，其曾孙朱奇?有子女九十四人（一说生子一百人）。”
    六，有些问题，在初版本中未曾叙述清楚。在订正本中多得到了补充。如初版本叙述墨子、老子、荀子和韩非等人的思想，秦始皇统一六国的原因，黄巢起义及其失败原因，………等问题，都不够清楚；而在订正本中都做了较详细的补充。又如初版本第三编第四章第三节，讲述北宋经济过程，忽略了当时主要的生产部门——农业。因此，订正本特增加了农业一段，说明北宋经济发展的原因与水利、垦荒、农业技术等发展的具体情况。
    七，有些问题的提法，在初版本中是不恰当的，这在订正本中多加以纠正。如对于“筑长城”一事，初版本仅说到：“世界古代著名大工程，长城是其中之一”，而忽略了长城对于中国生产的关系，是不恰当的。订正本改为：“从秦朝到明朝，长城起了防止北方游牧民族侵入中原的作用”；秦朝“兴水利、修驰道、拆毁旧长城、筑万里长城，伐胡越，都含有推进生产的意义；但是，当时人民还没很多的积蓄，耗费这样大的人力物力，人民无法负担。”是比较恰当的。又如对于王莽变法，初版本说：“王莽那样行为怪诞，历史上是罕见的，他似乎是个神经病者，又似乎是个巫师，同时还是个博学好古的儒者。……不能解决当时的根本问题，反而促成了农民起义。”这样注重在“怪诞”方面，忽略了阶级关系的分析，提法是不恰当的。订正本删去“王莽那样行为怪诞”以下四十四个字，又把最后一句话改为：王莽变法，“不能解决当时的根本问题，却加深了人民的灾难。农民起义成熟了，贵族地主也要参加这个起义。王莽变成了独夫。企图解决问题的王莽，成为被问题解决的王莽。”从阶级关系，阶级斗争中来分析王莽变法及其失败的原因，是比较恰当的、正确的。
    目前谈“中国通史简编”的版本，当然以北京新华书店一九四九年九月出版的订正本（即平装三册本）为最好。其次是华北新华书店，一九四八年出版的订正本（即精装二册本）。至于延安初版本，那是已经过时的东西，不可再用了。其余如晋冀鲁豫、东北和各解放区新华书店的旧版本，与新知书店、新中国书店的旧版本以及三联书店一九四九年七月在上海出版的“沪初版”本，都是根据延安初版本翻印的。在这些版本中，自然全盘保留着延安初版本的一切错误，而且多排印一次，错字多增加一些，如三联书店版竟把“台州民杨镇龙据玉山起义”，误为“台州民杨镇龙王山起义”（四九九页七行）；晋冀鲁豫新华书店版竟把“顾炎武江苏昆山县人”，误为“顾炎武江苏昆县人”（第六册六六六页一五行）；比延安初版本错误还多，那更是不可再用的书了。
    所谓“最好”的订正本，是与其他版本比较而言；至于说到订正本本身，缺点还是存在的。第一，错字还有许多。如“唐僖宗”，误为“唐熹宗”（五八九页）；“三炼成铜”、“得铜一斤”、“取铜新法”，误为“三炼成钢”、“得钢一斤”、“取钢新法”（七九一页）等，不过是其中的一二例而已。第二，有的史实值得重新考虑。如叙述张献忠，固然说明了“史传称献忠惨杀事，不大可信”；但是仍旧根据《史传》叙述，对于张献忠军纪严明的事实（见“大西骏骑营督都刘禁约”石刻）并未叙述。又如叙述满清初年禁止天主教士传教，只说：“教皇严禁中国教徒崇拜祖先，玄烨怒”，满清政府“严格保持一贯的海禁闭关政策”；这个说明是不够的，因为根据天主教教会所记载的史实来作比较具体的叙述，天主教在中国受到排斥是有更多的理由的，例如洋教士偷偷把中国地图送往欧洲也是激怒中国人的一个原因。第三，在某些地方，尚感理论分析不够清楚。如西周初年、中国历史开始走上封建制度阶段，是应该详细叙述分析的；但是书中对于史籍中的材料和地下发掘的材料，使用得不多，而且分析得更少。仅仅用一千多字来叙述“周初生产方式”——中国三千年封建制度开始时期的生产方式，实在太不够了。
