    Beihai Park Celebrates August 1st with Fireworks Display Tomorrow Night
    Beihai Park, in celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day and in conjunction with the week of opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, will hold a fireworks display on August 1st. Various fireworks will be set off, and there will be illuminated slogans such as "Celebrating the Founding Anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression against Taiwan and Korea," and "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Long Live Commander-in-Chief Zhu." Ticket prices will remain the same, with no additional charge. The fireworks display will take place from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM. In addition, to avoid overcrowding, the park will erect temporary ticket booths at the front gate and east of the Yuhé Bridge near the Caizhamen. An additional ticket booth will also be opened at the back gate. The small gates on the left and right sides of the front gate, as well as the Zhishan Gate and the side gate of the back gate, will be used as exits to facilitate visitor flow.

　　北海公园庆祝八一  明晚举办焰火大会
    北海公园为庆祝“八一”建军节及结合反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周。定于八月一日举办焰火大会。燃放各种焰火，并有“庆祝中国人民解放军建军节”、“反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜”及“毛主席万岁”、“朱总司令万岁”等电光标语，门票价照常，不另收费。燃放时间：晚八点半至十点半。又，该园为了避免拥护起见，在前门及御河桥东头铡草门前搭盖临时售票处各一座，后门亦增辟售票处，复开前门左右小门，陟山门及后门旁门为出口。以利游人。
