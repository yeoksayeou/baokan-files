　　Failure of the Aggression Against Korean War
    Truman Orders Conscription
    Attempting to Further Expand the War of Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] Due to the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, and in order to continue expanding the war of aggression, U.S. President Truman issued an order for conscription on the 7th. To this end, the announcement issued by the U.S. Department of Defense stated: "The Army, Navy, and Air Force have been ordered to have the authority to exceed the maximum limit of the total budget for military personnel." The announcement also stated: "This action is to establish the maximum combat power of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for the Korean War," as the "first step" to further aggression against Korea.
    According to the U.S. peacetime conscription law, passed in June 1948, the effective period was two years. The U.S. Congress passed another bill in June of this year to extend the law for one year, until July 9, 1951. The bill stipulates that all American men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five must register so that the president can conscript them into the army "at any time he deems necessary." Truman's order this time is to officially implement the conscription law.

　　侵略朝鲜战争失败
    杜鲁门下令征兵
    企图继续扩大侵略战争
    【新华社十日讯】由于侵略朝鲜战争的失败，和为了继续扩大侵略战争，美总统杜鲁门已于七日下令征兵。美国国防部为此所发布的公告称：“陆海空三军已奉令有权超出军事人员全部预算的最高限度。”公告并称：“这一行动乃是要建立用于朝鲜战争的陆海空三军的最大作战力量”，作为进一步侵略朝鲜的“第一个步骤”。
    按美国的平时征兵法，于一九四八年六月通过，有效期间为两年。美国国会于今年六月间又通过将该法延长一年，至一九五一年七月九日为止。该法案规定对所有十八岁至二十五岁的美国男子进行登记，以备总统在“任何时间他认为需要时”，即可征召他们入伍。杜鲁门这一次的命令，即为将该征兵法正式付诸实施。
