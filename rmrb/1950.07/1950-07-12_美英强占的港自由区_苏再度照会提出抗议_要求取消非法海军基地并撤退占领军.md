Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: According to TASS, the Soviet Foreign Ministry sent another note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on July 8 regarding the transformation of Trieste by the three countries into a US-British military base. The note reiterated the Soviet Union's position as stated in its note of April 20, protesting this illegal act by the three governments which violates the peace treaty with Italy and the provisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers.

After the Soviet Union issued its first note, the United States, Britain, and France delayed their response until June 16. This response arbitrarily shirked the responsibility for the failure to implement the provisions of the peace treaty with Italy and the Council of Foreign Ministers. It also avoided answering the six proposals put forward by the Soviet Union regarding the establishment of a normal order in Trieste.

Therefore, in this note, the Soviet Foreign Ministry once again pointed out: "The United States government, as well as the governments of Britain and France, should be held responsible for the failure to fulfill the clauses of the peace treaty with Italy concerning the Free Territory of Trieste."

The note further stated: "The Soviet government insists on the unconditional fulfillment of the terms of the peace treaty with Italy and insists on implementing the measures regarding the Free Territory of Trieste as indicated in the Soviet government's note of April 20." These measures are: (1) the immediate implementation of the provisional government regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste; (2) the immediate appointment of a Governor of the Free Territory; (3) the establishment of a provisional government for the Free Territory; (4) determining the effective date of the permanent statute of the Free Territory; (5) the cancellation of illegal US-British naval bases; (6) the withdrawal of US-British occupying forces.

　　美英强占的港自由区
    苏再度照会提出抗议
    要求取消非法海军基地并撤退占领军
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部于七月八日再度就美、英、法三国变的里雅斯特为美、英军事基地一事，照会三国政府，重申苏联在四月二十日照会中采取的立场，抗议三国政府这一违反对意和约与外长会议规定的非法行为。
    自苏联发出第一次照会后，美、英、法三国延至六月十六日始予答复，这一答复武断地把对意和约与外长会议所规定的未能实行的责任推诿了事，而对苏联所提关于在的里雅斯特建立正常秩序的六项建议，则避不置答。
    因此，苏联外交部在此次照会中再度指出：“美国政府以及英法两国政府应对对意和约有关的里雅斯特自由区条款之未能履行负责。”
    照会又指出：“苏联政府坚持无条件履行对意和约条款，坚持实行苏联政府四月二十日照会中所指出的关于的里雅斯特自由区的措施。”这些措施就是：（一）立即实行的里雅斯特自由区临时政府条例；（二）立刻任命自由区总督；（三）成立自由区临时政府；（四）确定自由区永久法规生效日期；（五）取消美英非法海军基地；（六）撤退美英占领军。
