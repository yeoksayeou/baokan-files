　　Yan University Dean Lin Handa Denounces American Bandits' Intimidation
　　[Report from this newspaper] Lin Handa, Dean of Studies at Yenching University, issued a written statement regarding the illegal declaration made by the imperialist bandit Truman on June 27, stating:
　　“We will resolutely not be intimidated by the American imperialist swindler bandits, and resolutely oppose any illegal interference to obstruct the liberation of our Taiwan. China is the China of the Chinese, and the Chinese will never allow the United States to enslave any part of Chinese territory. All oppressed nations of the East unite and strive for great national independence! Truth is on our side, the people of the whole world are on our side, and we have enough power to send the American imperialists who dare to openly invade and destroy the UN Charter into the grave they dug themselves!”

　　燕大教务长林汉达斥美国强盗的恫吓
    【本报讯】燕京大学教务长林汉达为帝国主义强盗杜鲁门在六月二十七日的非法声明发表书面谈话称：
    “我们决不受美帝国主义骗子强盗的恫吓，坚决地反对任何非法的干涉来阻挠我们的台湾的解放。中国是中国人的中国，中国人决不允许美国奴役中国领土的任何一部分。全东方被压迫的民族团结起来，为伟大的民族独立而奋斗！真理是在我们这一边，全世界的人民是在我们这一边，我们有足够的力量，把破坏联合国宪章敢于公然侵略的美帝国主义送入他自己所挖的坟墓！”
