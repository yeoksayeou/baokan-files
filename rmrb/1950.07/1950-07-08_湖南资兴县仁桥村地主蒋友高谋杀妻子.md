　　To the Editors:

　　Huang Jinchuan, a poor peasant woman from Renqiao Village, Zixing County, Hunan Province, was forced to marry landlord Jiang Yougao as his second wife five years ago. After the marriage, Jiang Yougao often beat Jinchuan cruelly. Unable to bear the abuse, Jinchuan had to return to her parents' home frequently.

　　This year, after the Dragon Boat Festival, Jinchuan returned from her parents' home. At this time, she already knew that Jiang Yougao was having affairs outside and had contracted venereal disease, so she did not sleep with him. On the night of the 21st of this month, Jiang Yougao took an axe to chop at Jinchuan. Jinchuan didn't even have time to hold her child, and fled in the dark and heavy rain to her aunt's house, which was about a mile away. The next morning, Jiang Yougao sent someone to call her back, saying that the child had no milk to eat and was crying very badly. She had no choice but to go back.

　　At lunchtime that day, Jinchuan held the child and took a bowl to get more rice. Jiang Yougao stopped her from getting more. Unable to bear it any longer, she said, "You can eat, and I can eat too." When Jiang Yougao saw her retort, he grabbed a wood-chopping knife and chopped fiercely at the top of her head. Jinchuan immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. Jiang Yougao then chopped her head twice more and her buttocks once. Jinchuan's injuries were very serious, and her life was in danger. Jiang Yougao tried to escape after committing the crime. Fortunately, the local farmers' association discovered it early and immediately arrested him and handed him over to the People's Court.

　　This incident fully illustrates the evils of feudal marriage and the ruthlessness of landlord Jiang Yougao. The masses expressed extreme indignation at this, especially the women. Everyone unanimously advocated that he be severely punished according to the law. The Zixing County People's Government also attaches great importance to this case. It has now accepted the opinions of the women and will strictly handle this case.

　　湖南资兴县仁桥村地主蒋友高谋杀妻子           编者同志：
    湖南省资兴县仁桥村贫农妇女黄金钏，五年前被迫嫁给地主蒋友高做填房。结婚后，蒋友高对金钏时加毒打。金钏不堪虐待，只好时常回娘家。
    今年端午节后，金钏由娘家回来。这时，她已知蒋友高在外面搞女人，染上了花柳病，就没有与他同宿。本月二十一日夜晚，蒋友高拿着斧子要砍金钏。金钏连孩子也来不及抱，就在黑夜里冒着大雨逃到一里外的舅母家中。第二天早上，蒋友高派人叫她回去，说孩子没奶吃，哭得很厉害。她只好回去了。
    这天吃午饭时，金钏抱孩子拿碗去添饭。蒋友高拦住不准她添。她实在无法忍耐了，就说：“你可以吃饭，我也可以吃饭。”蒋友高见她回嘴，竟拿了柴刀狠命向她头顶砍去，金钏随即倒地，不省人事，蒋友高又在她头上砍了两刀，在臀部砍了一刀。金钏伤势非常沉重，生命垂危。蒋友高行凶后即想潜逃。幸当地农会发觉得早，马上把他促住送交人民法院。
    这件事充分地说明了封建婚姻的罪恶和地主蒋友高的狠毒。群众对此表示极度愤慨，尤其是妇女们。大家一致主张依法严办。资兴县人民政府对这案件也非常重视。现已接受妇女们的意见，将严格处理这个案件。
