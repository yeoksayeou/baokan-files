An Overview of Health and Medical Undertakings in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

Zhou

Pyongyang Medical University:

The university is under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health and is divided into three departments (colleges): Medicine, Pharmacy, and Hygiene. The Department of Medicine has a five-year program after high school, while the other two departments have a four-year program after high school. Currently (as of spring this year), there are 793 students and 64 professors, lecturers, and assistants. The university is affiliated with a research institute, which is a place for cultivating experts and teachers. Eighty percent of the students are publicly funded, and twenty percent are privately funded. After graduation, they are all assigned work by the state.

Pyongyang University Affiliated Hospital:

It is a new three-story building with 400 beds, exclusively for clinical teaching and internships for students in the Department of Medicine, third year and above. All are organized by department, with surgical beds accounting for more than one-third of all beds (140 beds). There are 447 staff members, with only 32 administrative staff. The characteristic of this hospital, from the perspective of the department's organization, is that it is closely related to teaching needs. For example, the surgical ward is divided into general surgery, department (specialty) surgery, and clinical (acute) surgery. In the general surgery department, students complete preliminary clinical knowledge and diagnostic techniques. In the department surgery department, students complete various departmental diagnosis and treatment techniques. In the clinical surgery department, patients are not used for general lectures, only for student groups to rotate internships. The situation in other departments is basically the same. This not only satisfies the students' academic needs, but upon completion of their studies, they become skilled doctors. Acute patients are not delayed or reduced in their treatment benefits due to entering the affiliated hospital. All doctors in the affiliated hospital, except for resident doctors, have both clinical and teaching duties.

The hospital's outpatient department (clinic) is completely isolated from the inpatient ward. The administration is unified by the president, but the funding is independent, the equipment is independent, and the staff is fixed. It is open all day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Each department in the outpatient clinic has a liaison nurse who is responsible for escorting patients to the hospital.

Special Hospital:

It does not have many beds and is exclusively for the treatment of senior government officials. The equipment is perfect, the organization is simple, and the doctors have high technical standards. All are full-time. The president is also the director of internal medicine and is responsible for physical examinations for senior officials. Outpatient doctors are concurrently hospital doctors, and the outpatient hours are shorter than ordinary hospitals.

Wonsan Central Hospital (Provincial Central Hospital):

The organizational form is roughly the same as that of the Pyongyang University Affiliated Hospital, but the material equipment is poorer. It has 100 beds, with surgical beds accounting for one-half of the total. Doctors have triple duties: treatment, teaching (provincial medical school), and leading technical work in the county (district) clinics. Technical leadership for counties and districts is the central task of the hospital, and they must go to the counties and districts for inspection and guidance on time. Subordinate units can also request the hospital to assist in solving technical difficulties at any time. During inspection work, in addition to solving technical problems, it is necessary to fight against irresponsible phenomena in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Public Health. For example, if doctors have perfunctory or evasive behavior in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, they must be strictly investigated and given appropriate punishment.

The three hospitals have different tasks, but they have a unified working method. For example, outpatient services are handled independently, the staff is full-time (except for special hospitals), consultations are available all day, the admission procedures are strict and simple, and patients are escorted to the hospital by liaison nurses after being approved by the outpatient doctor. After the registration procedures are completed, they enter the ward through the hospital door to the emergency room (emergency treatment or weighing), barber shop, changing room, and bathroom, and enter the ward in patient clothing.

Family members are not allowed to give food when visiting patients. They must wear isolation gowns, masks, wash their hands, and come and go on time. Except for children, family members are not allowed to accompany patients, and there is no special nursing system.

The payment procedure is simple (all free in special hospitals). Those with social insurance cards, maternity patients, and children under three years old receive free diagnosis and treatment. Ordinary people pay only 40% of the average medical expenses for outpatient and inpatient treatment, and the remaining 60% is subsidized by the state.

Because the burden (mental and economic) on patients is reduced, the sense of responsibility of medical staff is strong, and the system is clear and the management is conscientious, a new hospital order of rest and happiness and a correct relationship between patients trusting and respecting doctors and doctors caring for and loving patients has been established.

Factory Nursery:

A factory nursery in Pyongyang takes in (half-day care) children from forty days to three years old of female workers. There are forty beds, and the entrance is as strict as a hospital. There is an inspection room, changing room, bathroom, and feeding room at the entrance. Children are sent in before the factory starts work and picked up after work. The nursery provides a fixed amount of food, soap, diapers, etc. The nannies are formally trained. The equipment is clean and beautiful. The expenses of the nursery are entirely paid by the factory. The factory hospital is responsible for the children's health, and doctors and nurses are assigned to manage the children's meals and admission inspections. There is also a health care system:

(1) Regular physical examinations for children: If the development (weight, height, chest circumference) does not meet the standards, the reasons must be investigated, a summary must be made, and a report must be submitted.

(2) Regular vaccinations: Immunizations are carried out according to the season and the occurrence of infectious diseases.

(3) Necessary diagnosis and treatment: If a child stays at home and does not come, a nurse must be sent for a home visit. Depending on the severity of the illness, the child may be treated at home or admitted to the factory hospital.

Outer Kumgang San Sanatorium:

It has 500 beds. All the buildings are converted from a villa of Japanese capitalists. All those who enter the sanatorium for recuperation are free of charge. A certificate jointly issued by the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Public Health must be held before entering the sanatorium. The sanatorium is for complete rest and relaxation and lasts for fourteen days. There is also a semi-treatment sanatorium, which lasts for twenty days. The sanatorium is administratively under the leadership of the Ministry of Labor. The expenses are also borne by the Ministry of Labor.

Outer Kumgang Mountain is a famous scenic spot and fish production area on the east coast. The sanatorium is at the foot of the mountain and faces the sea. The facilities inside are all available. In addition to dormitories, the buildings include hot spring baths, public canteens, sales offices, libraries, cultural rooms, industrial exhibition rooms, chess rooms, billiard rooms, table tennis rooms, music rooms, dance halls, theaters, and other large and small buildings. There are also production departments such as chicken farms, dairy farms, vegetable gardens, and orchards nearby.

Infectious Disease Research Institute:

The Pyongyang Infectious Disease Research Institute is the only large-scale serum and vaccine manufacturing plant in North Korea. It is divided into seven departments and three sections, with more than 120 technical personnel. All serum and vaccines for the 18 infectious diseases stipulated by the state are manufactured and supplied here. The quarterly output can supply the entire North Korea with a surplus. According to the director, typhoid fever was prevalent in 1945, cholera was prevalent in 1946, and encephalitis was prevalent in 1949. Up to now, there has been no large-scale epidemic of infectious diseases in North Korea.

The pharmaceutical industry in North Korea is not yet developed. But looking at their emphasis on preventive medicine and the resulting effects, it proves that if a medically backward country wants to truly develop people's health undertakings, it can only start with the development of preventive medicine.

Building in Difficulties:

The main difficulty is the lack of cadres. There were only 246 medical personnel at the time of liberation. There are now 1,130.

The way to overcome the difficulties is to establish specialized schools. Four schools were established in 1946 and two schools were established in 1947, for a total of six schools. After graduation, students are called assistant doctors and are sent to work in rural areas or factories. Medical universities were established: Pyongyang, Chongjin, and Hamhung.

In 1949, 72 doctors and 282 assistant doctors graduated. In 1950, 157 doctors and 557 assistant doctors will graduate. Nurses are trained uniformly by the Ministry of Public Health, and 890 have already graduated. By 1952, the cadre problem is expected to be completely resolved.

Fighting Against Infectious Diseases: The current difficulty is that North Korea has no foundation for the prevention of infectious diseases, no formal isolation hospitals, and feudal ideas are strong in rural areas, causing many obstacles.

Countermeasures: To fight against feudal ideas in rural areas, the Ministry of Public Health has set up a special propaganda department to educate the masses through a large number of students and workers.

Demand Exceeds Supply of Medicines and Equipment: In the past, there were only 50 treatment units, but now there are 1,000 treatment units, while the pharmaceutical industry is only beginning to take shape.

Patients' diets are not good. Almost none of the Korean dishes meet the nutritional requirements of patients. A national food conference is planned this year to solve the problem.

Maternal and Child Health Facilities:

According to the provisions of the Korean Constitution, the Ministry of Public Health has a special Maternal and Child Department to deal with the health of mothers and children. The maternal and child health system that has been implemented is:

Maternity leave of 40 days before and after childbirth.

Maternity hospitalization is completely free, and newborn materials are entirely borne by the state.

Each hospital must prepare one-thirteenth of the beds for obstetrics.

Each agency must set up a hygiene room for women for use during menstruation.

Each factory must set up a nursery to take in children from forty days to three years old of female workers free of charge.

The government registers every child in the district and sends doctors to visit on time and teach mothers various hygiene knowledge.

Diagnosis and treatment materials for children under three years old are completely provided by the government free of charge.

The train is equipped with a mother and child carriage for children under three years old, so that they can receive the special care they deserve.

Factory and Rural Hygiene:

The Ministry of Public Health stipulates that in addition to completing his due daily work, the government also allocates a certain number of households in the area where each medical worker lives for him to manage health work. These households should be visited by the doctor on time, especially women and children. So the era of doctors in North Korea being irresponsible to patients is over.

The older generation of doctors in Korea only wanted to wait for patients at home and were unwilling to go to the patients, let alone to the countryside. They believe that "quack doctors are not noble doctors, and things delivered to your door are definitely not good." Ideological struggle for the health of the people is necessary, but in order to do the work well, more attention must be paid to organization, system, discipline, and other issues.

Starting in 1950, the Ministry of Public Health will strengthen the special health care work of factory (plant) and mine hospitals, count the recuperation time for workers who temporarily lose their labor power, count the loss time for not being able to maintain an eight-hour work system, count the total loss time of the country, and summarize the work to find out how to avoid and prevent injuries. The same importance is attached to occupational diseases, and prevention methods should be derived from investigation, statistics, research, and summary.

The public health undertaking in North Korea after liberation has made amazing achievements. The broad masses of people have reduced their economic burden and have been encouraged spiritually, thus changing the relationship between doctors and patients. Under the new health direction and system, North Korea has not only gradually changed the old relationship between doctors and patients and improved the health level of the people, but also helped the development of production and the growth of the working class. The development process of the Korean medical and health undertaking has some things that are worth our reference. We wish that the medical construction of Korea will be further developed and strengthened on the original basis to meet the needs of the liberation war.

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的卫生医药事业概况
    周
    平壤医学大学：
    大学属保健省领导，分设医学、药学、卫生学三部（院）。医学部为高中五年制，其他两部为高中四年制，现有（本年春）学生七九三名、教授讲助共六四名，大学附设研究院，为培育专家及师资处。学生百分之八十为公费生，二十为私费生，毕业后一律由国家分配工作。
    平大附属医院：
    是一座三层楼的新建筑，病床四○○张，专供大学医学部，三年级以上学生临床讲授及实习处。全部以科为单位，外科病床占全部病床三分之一强（一四○张），工作人员四四七名，总务人员仅三二名。这座医院的特点，从科的组织上看，是和教学需要密切联系着的，如外科病房分为普通（总论）外科，各部（各论）外科，临床（急病）外科三部。在普通外科部完成学生初步临诊知识和诊断技术。在各部外科部完成各科诊疗技术。临床外科部病人不作普通授课，仅供学生小组轮流实习。其他各科情形亦基本相同。这样既满足了学生的学业需要，学业终了，即成为熟练医生。急症病人亦不因进入附属医院，而有所延误或减少其诊疗利益。附院全部医生，除住院医生一级外，都兼有临床及授课两重任务。
    医院的门诊部（诊疗所）和住院病房完全隔离，行政由院长统一管理，但经费独立，设备独立，职员固定，每日自上午九时至下午五时，全日应诊。门诊各科设有联络护士，专任护送病人入院工作。
    特别病院：
    病床不多，专供政府高级干部治疗之用，设备完美，组织单纯，医生技术水准高，一律专任。院长由内科主任兼，负有为高干查体任务。门诊医生由院医兼任，门诊时间较普通医院短。
    元山中央病院（省立中央医院）：
    组织形式大致与平大附属医院相同，物质设备较差。病床一○○张，外科病床占全部二分之一。医生兼有三重工作任务，即治疗、教学（省立医专）和领导郡（县）区诊疗技术工作。对郡区技术领导为本院的中心任务，须按时赴郡区检阅指导。下属机关亦可随时向该院请求协助解决技术困难。在检阅工作时，除解决技术问题外，要依据保健省明令，和不负责任现象作斗争。如医生对病人的诊疗有敷衍和推卸现象，即须严格追究，予以适当处分。
    三座病院的任务不同，但有统一的工作方式，如门诊的独立办理，人员专任（特别病院例外），全日应诊，入院手续严格简单，病人经门诊医生批准后，由联络护士护送入院。登记手续完了，经院门入救急室（紧急处理或量体重），理发室，更衣室，浴室，穿着病人服装进入病房。
    家属探视病人，不许赠送食品，入院须穿隔离衣，戴口罩，洗手，按时来去，除小儿外，不许家属陪伴，亦无特别护理制度。
    交费手续简单（特别病院全部免费），有社会保险证者，产妇，三岁以下小儿，均免费诊疗。普通人民应诊住院，平均仅纳医药费百分之四○，其百分之六○，由国家补贴。
    因病人的负担（精神和经济）减轻，医务人员的责任心强，加以制度明确，管理认真，因此建立了安憩愉快的新的医院秩序和病人信任医生，敬重医生，医生关心病人爱护病人的正确关系。
    工厂托儿所：
    平壤的一所工厂托儿所，收留（半托）女工们四十天到三岁的小儿入所，所有床位四十张，门禁和医院一样严格。入门有检查室，更衣室，浴室和喂奶室。小儿于工厂上工前送入，于放工后领出。由所方供给定量食物，及肥皂尿布等。褓姆均受过正式训练。设备整洁美好，托儿所的经费，完全由工厂开支。小儿健康则由厂方医院负责，派有医生护士管理小儿伙食及入所检查。并定有保健制度：
    （一）按时为小儿查体：如发育（体重，身长，胸围）不合标准便须追究原因，得出总结，向上汇报。
    （二）按时预防注射：依照季节及传染病发生情况进行免疫注射。
    （三）作必要的诊疗：如小儿留家内不来，即须派护士作家庭访问，视病情轻重，或留家内治疗或送入工厂医院住院。
    外金刚休养所：
    有床位五百张，全部建筑是由日本资本家的一个别墅改修的。入所休养的人员，全部免费。须持有劳动省和保健省共同发给的证明，始能入所。休养所为完全休息性质，时间为十四天。另有半治疗性质的静养所，为期二十天。休养所在行政上受劳动省领导。经费亦由劳动省负担。
    外金刚山是东海滨有名的风景区及产鱼区，休养所在山麓下。背山临海，所内设备，应有尽有。建筑除宿舍外，包括温泉浴池，公共食堂，售品所，图书馆，文化室，工业展览室，棋房，弹子房，乒乓室，音乐室及舞厅、剧场等大小多所。附近还有鸡场牛奶场菜园果园等生产部门。
    传染病研究所：
    平壤传染病研究所是北朝鲜唯一的规模宏大的血清疫苗制造所。分七部三科，有技术人员一百二十余名。国家法定的十八种传染病的血清疫苗全部均由此制造供应。每季出品，可供全北朝鲜使用有余。据所长说：一九四五年流行过伤寒，四六年流行过霍乱，四九年流行过脑炎，到现在止北朝鲜各地已不见有传染病大量流行。
    北朝鲜的制药工业尚不发达。但看他们对于预防医学的重视，和因此而收到的效果，证明医学落后的国家，要真正发展人民的保健事业，只有从发展预防医学着手。
    在困难中建设起来：
    主要困难是干部不够，解放时仅二四六名医务人员。现有一一三○名。
    克服困难的方法是创设专科学校。一九四六年设四所，四七年设二所，共六所。学生毕业后称副医，派入农村或工厂工作。设医科大学：平壤、清津、咸兴三所。
    到一九四九年度毕业医生七二名，副医二八二名。一九五○年将毕业的医生一五七名，副医五五七名。护士由保健省统一训练，现已毕业者有八九○名。到一九五二年，干部问题，可望全部解决。
    与传染病作斗争：当前的困难是北朝鲜对传染病预防无基础，无正规隔离病院，乡村中封建思想浓厚，阻碍重重。
    对策：对乡村封建思想斗争，保健省特设宣传部，通过广大的学生工人去教育群众。
    药品器械供不应求：过去仅五十个治疗单位现增至一千个治疗单位，而制药工业仅初具规模。
    病人饮食不好，朝鲜饭菜几乎没一样合乎病人营养要求，今年准备开全国性伙食会议解决。
    妇幼卫生的设施：
    根据朝鲜宪法的规定，保健省专设母子部，处理母亲和小儿保健问题。现已实行的有关母子的保健制度为：
    产妇生产前后各休假四十天。
    产妇生产住院完全免费，婴儿出生物资完全由国家负担。
    每座医院要为产妇准备十三分之一的病床，作产科使用。
    每个机关要为女性设卫生室，备月经时使用。
    每间工厂要设托儿所，免费收留女工四十天到三岁的孩子。
    每区小儿，政府都予登记，派医按时访问并教给母亲们各种卫生知识。
    三岁以下小儿诊疗物资，完全由政府免费供给。
    火车上为三岁以下小儿备母子车厢，使他们得到应有的特殊照顾。
    工场农村卫生：
    保健省规定每一个医务工作者，除完成他应有的日常工作外，政府还在他住居的地区，配给一定的户口，由他管理保健工作。这些户口，应按时受这个医生的访问，特别是妇女儿童。所以在北朝鲜医生对病人不负责任的时代过去了。
    朝鲜老一代的医生，只愿在家里等待病人，不愿意到病人那里去，更不愿意到农村去。他们认为“走江湖的郎中，不是高尚医生，送上门的东西，绝对没有好货”，为了人民的健康进行思想斗争是必须的，但为得把工作搞好，同时更要注意组织、制度、纪律等问题。
    从一九五○年起，保健省要加强工场（厂）矿山医院的特殊保健工作，统计劳动者暂时失掉劳动力的休养时间，统计不能保持八小时工作制的损失时间，统计国家的总损失时间，并要从总结工作中找出怎样避免和预防外伤的方法。对于职业病亦同样重视，要由调查、统计、研究、总结而得出预防的办法。
    解放后的北朝鲜保健事业已有惊人成就。广大人民在经济上减轻了负担，精神上受到了鼓舞，因此改变了医、病双方的关系。北朝鲜在新的保健方向和制度下，不仅逐渐改变了医、病双方的旧关系，提高人民的健康水平，而且帮助了生产的发展和劳动阶级的壮大。朝鲜医药事业的发展过程，有些是值得我们参考的。我们预祝朝鲜的医学建设在原有的基础上配合解放战争的需要，更加发展壮大起来。
