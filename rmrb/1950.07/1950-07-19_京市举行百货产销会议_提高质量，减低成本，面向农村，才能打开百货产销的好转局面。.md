(Beijing News Agency Report) The Beijing Department Store Production and Sales Conference opened on the morning of the 13th of this month. This conference was convened according to the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to adjust industry and commerce. Attending the conference were 41 representatives from the Municipal Finance Committee, the Bureau of Industry, the Bureau of Commerce, the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Beijing Branch of the China Department Store Company, the Department Store Trade Association, and industry trade associations for knitting, rubber, weaving and dyeing, soap, cigarettes, and matches. The conference was presided over by Peng Cheng, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce. The conference held extensive discussions on various issues related to the production, sales, and management of the department store industry for two and a half days. With a sincere attitude, the representatives recognized the main shortcomings in the existing department store production and sales industry through mutual review, and put forward many positive suggestions for improvement, creating a good start for the future development of the industry. In order to solve the problems more effectively, the conference decided to compile these opinions and submit them to the relevant parties for research, and then hold a meeting to summarize them.

Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance Committee, attended the meeting to provide guidance during the discussions. He said: Since liberation, the overall situation of Beijing's department store production and sales industry has been developing from recovery, and the quality of products has improved. However, due to the poor production foundation, there are still many difficulties and shortcomings. The government will do its best to help manufacturers overcome difficulties within the possible conditions. Manufacturers themselves must spend effort, actively manage, improve quality, and open up sales channels. He particularly pointed out that public and private sectors, production and sales must pay attention to mutual cooperation, close cooperation, and gradually improve planning to jointly strive for the development of Beijing's production!

The scale of factories in Beijing's department store production and sales industry is small and the technology is poor, so the cost of some products is high and the quality is low, so they are not as popular as Shanghai goods in Beijing. Department stores that operate department store distribution, because the cost of imported goods is low and they sell quickly, of course it is not possible to use accumulated funds to promote local goods in large quantities. According to department store estimates, local department store goods sold in Beijing department stores generally account for only about 10% of all commodities. In a large consumer market like Beijing, it is difficult to sell a small number of local products. This phenomenon of production and sales not being closely coordinated is the main characteristic of Beijing's department store production and sales industry.

The Department Store Production and Sales Conference discussed this characteristic and reached a preliminary consensus: 1. In terms of production, we should first gradually improve quality and reduce costs on the existing basis, and produce for the urban people and the vast number of rural farmers, so that there will be a vast market and prospects for development. Improving quality is to improve on the existing basis, not necessarily to replace a set of machines. It is wrong to think that Beijing's production technology is backward and cannot be improved, and that the countryside needs only inferior goods. Reducing costs mainly means reducing redundant staff, reducing waste, and increasing output. In the past, department stores used acquisition and processing to support department store production, which played a significant role, but many products from private factories did not meet specifications, and the company's cost calculation and planning also had shortcomings. In the future, products should have certain specifications, and contracts should be used to implement planning as soon as possible. 2. In terms of improving management: Organizations related to production and sales research and liaison should be established to strengthen the coordination between the public and private sectors and between production and sales. Labor-management consultation meetings should be actively established within the factories and stores of various industries to improve business management. In addition, in the past, it was possible to make money by hoarding goods due to inflation, but in the future, it is necessary to earnestly grasp the principle of small profits but quick turnover and develop business. 3. In terms of opening up sales channels: We should face the countryside, face the Northwest, and exchange local products and furs from the Northwest to strengthen material exchanges. The promotion method can appropriately organize different types of joint ventures to save expenses and close production and sales relationships; at the same time, it is also necessary to consolidate and expand the existing markets in the Northeast, Hebei, North China rural areas and the city. Private department stores in the city should try their best to take care of the promotion of local products.

　　京市举行百货产销会议
    提高质量，减低成本，面向农村，才能打开百货产销的好转局面。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市百货产销会议已于本月十三日上午开幕。这个会议是按照中央人民政府贸易部的指示为了调整工商业而召开的。出席这个会议的有：市财委会、工业局、商业局、工商联合会筹委会、中国百货公司北京分公司、百货业同业公会及针织、橡胶、织染、肥皂、卷烟、火柴等工业同业公会的代表共四十一人，由市商业局副局长彭城主持。会议曾就百货业在生产、推销及经营上的一些问题进行了两天半时间的广泛讨论。代表们都以诚恳的态度，从相互检讨中，认识了百货产销业现存的主要缺点，并提出许多积极性的改善意见，为该业今后的发展创造了一个良好的开端。会议为了能更切实地解决问题，决定将这些意见整理提交各有关方面研究后，再开会总结。
    市财委会程宏毅副主任曾于大会讨论时到会指导。他说：京市百货产销业在解放后，总的情况是在从恢复走向发展，产品质量已有提高；但由于生产基础不好，困难与缺点还很多，政府在可能条件下，一定尽力协助厂商克服困难。厂商自身必须花费力气，积极经营，提高质量，打开销路。他特别指出：公私之间，产销之间必须注意相互配合，密切合作，逐渐提高计划性，共同为发展北京市的生产而努力！
    京市百货产销业，工厂的规模较小，技术较差，所以有些产品的成本较高，质量较低，因而比不上上海货在北京城内销的多。而经营百货运销的商店，又由于外来货成本低，销的又快，当然也不可能积压资金来大量地推销本地货。据百货业估计：京市各百货商店销售的本地百货，一般只占全部商品的百分之十左右。像在北京这样一个大的消费市场，而数量并不大的本地产品却很难销售，这种产销不能紧密配合的现象，便是京市百货产销业最主要的特点。
    百货产销会议针对这一特点作了讨论，获得了初步的一致意见：一、在生产方面，首先应在现有基础上逐步提高质量，减低成本，生产面向城市人民大众，面向农村广大农民，这样才有广大市场和发展的前途。提高质量，是在现有基础上提高，并不是必须换一套机器。认为北京生产技术落后，无法提高，以及认为农村需要的正是次货的种种想法，都是不对的。减低成本主要是减少冗员，减少浪费，提高产量等。过去百货公司用收购、加工来扶植百货生产，起了很大作用，但私营工厂产品很多不够规格，公司收购的成本计算与计划性也有缺点。今后产品应有一定的规格，尽速做到以合同来贯彻计划性。二、在改善经营方面：应该建立有关产销方面的研究及联系的机构，加强公私间与产销间的配合。各行业厂店内部应积极建立劳资协商会议借以改善经营管理。此外，过去由于通货膨胀，只要囤货就能赚钱，今后则必须切实掌握薄利多销的方针，开展业务。三、在打开销路方面：应面向农村，面向西北，从西北还可换回土产、皮毛，加强物资交流。推销方式可以适当地组织不同类型的联营组织，以节省开支，密切产销关系；同时，也还必须巩固并扩展东北、热河、华北农村及本市现有市场。本市私营百货商店，应尽量照顾本地产品的推销。
