　　Unite All Teachers and Students to Carry Out Political Education
    Wuhan University Presents a Fresh Outlook
    [Our reporter from Wuchang] Since October of last year, Wuhan University has begun planned and systematic political education. In the past six months, it has achieved great results, bringing a completely new atmosphere to the entire school. The school leadership regards political education as the "basic key to transforming old university education into new university education." In the process, they emphasized the importance of unity, put forward the slogan of "seeking progress through unity," and strived to ensure that everyone voluntarily participated in political study. First, the school determined the focus of political education based on the ideological situation of all personnel. The main requirements were to enable everyone to distinguish between right and wrong, determine their own political path, establish confidence in the future of the revolution, establish a standpoint of everything for the people, belonging to the people, and relying on the people, and establish a labor perspective, collective spirit, mass viewpoint, and internationalist spirit. There were three main ways to implement political education: First, explain the political situation and interpret policies based on major international and domestic events and issues that occurred in each period. Political education was also carried out in handling various tasks within the school or through various activities. For example, the school fully conducted prior ideological mobilization in the movements of evaluating people's scholarships, carrying out production and conservation, purchasing public bonds, voluntarily reducing salaries, organizing teachers' unions and trade unions, conducting major work inspections, openly discussing the Party and the Youth League, and especially reforming the curriculum and improving teaching methods. Ideological ferment was unfolded during the process, and ideological summaries were made afterward. This not only enabled problems to be solved smoothly, but also improved the thinking of teachers and students. Second, the whole school's teachers, students, staff, and their families were organized to attend large-scale conferences to make large reports. Third, regular political classes were given, such as the school-wide "New Outlook on Life," "History of Social Development," and the class-specific "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," and "On New Democracy." The school-wide "New Outlook on Life" and other large courses were closely linked to reality and achieved greater results, while the class-specific "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" and other courses achieved lesser results.
    Through this series of political education, everyone now feels that Wuhan University has undergone a "major change in people's hearts" and presents a "fresh outlook." First, political education has eliminated the fear and doubt of some people about the Communist Party and gradually turned it into trust and respect; Party members and Youth League members have gained the trust of the masses; and the number of people applying to join the Party and the Youth League has increased day by day. Outside the Party, a large number of cadres who firmly accept the leadership of the Party and actively promote work among the masses have emerged. The majority of people have improved their understanding of the people's democratic country, and many actions of loving the people's country and loving the working people have emerged. A large number of students voluntarily gave up applying for people's scholarships, and faculty and staff voluntarily reduced their salaries. Before liberation, 80 percent of the school's students received "public funding," but in the past six months, the number of students applying for people's scholarships decreased from 35 percent to 19.7 percent. Faculty and staff throughout the school voluntarily reduced their monthly salaries by 22,030 yuan. The school purchased more than 10,000 public bonds (equivalent to more than 70,000 yuan in wages). Teachers, students, and staff have launched conservation efforts, and the electricity consumption in April this year was only half of what it was before liberation; destruction of public property and waste have disappeared. At the same time, teachers and students clearly recognized enemies and friends in international relations. "American worship fever," "fear of America sickness," and "anti-Soviet sentiments" have been basically eliminated. Warm support was expressed for the Soviet Union, such as Simonov and Soviet scholars, as well as the visit of the Soviet Youth League to the school, the October Revolution anniversary and Stalin's birthday last year, and the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, all of which were warmly welcomed, celebrated, and supported by the vast majority of the school.
    The employee viewpoint of faculty and staff in their work and the thinking of students studying for "promotion and wealth" have been transformed. With the change in work attitude and learning attitude, work efficiency and learning efficiency have gradually improved. According to the results of the major work inspection at the end of last year, the work efficiency of faculty and staff has increased by two to three times compared with the past. Although students' political activities have increased, their academic performance in general courses is much better than before liberation. An atmosphere of academic research based on new political viewpoints has begun to develop. For example, the Michurin Society of the Biology Department and the Agricultural College, the Modern Literature Research Group of the Chinese Department, and the collective research and collective teaching of many new courses in the Law Department and the Economics Department have all achieved considerable results. Individualism, sectarianism, and liberalism among teachers and students have gradually been eliminated, and a new spirit of unity and mutual assistance has emerged. Even the families of faculty and staff have united and organized. Everyone runs nurseries, engages in production, listens to political reports together, and organizes study and recreational activities, presenting a happy and lively atmosphere. At the same time, life is also becoming simple and serious, without a style of extravagance and corruption.
    Due to these achievements, teachers' and students' interest in political learning has greatly increased. The weekly political mega-class has become everyone's biggest concern. Starting in April, a rotational learning system was launched among staff. The work of five people on weekdays is done by three people, and a portion of the staff is drawn out to organize study classes and conduct specialized political learning on a rotating basis.

### 团结全校师生开展政治教育  武汉大学气象一新

　　团结全校师生开展政治教育
    武汉大学气象一新
    【本报武昌讯】自去年十月份起，武汉大学开始了有计划、有系统的政治教育。半年来收获很大，使全校气象为之一新。该校领导方面把政治教育看成是“旧大学教育改造为新大学教育的基本关键”。在进行中强调了团结的重要，提出了“以团结求进步”的口号，争取每个人都自愿地来参加政治学习。首先，该校根据全校人员的思想情况，规定了政治教育的重点，主要要求是使大家分清是非，确定自己的政治道路，确定对革命前途的信心，建立一切为了人民、属于人民、依靠人民的立场，树立劳动观点、集体精神、群众观点和国际主义精神。实施政治教育的主要方式有三种：其一，根据每一时期国际国内和所发生的重大事件与问题，进行政治形势的说明和政策的解释。并在处理校内各种工作或通过各种活动进行政治教育，如该校在评议人民助学金、开展生产节约、购买公债、自愿减薪、组织教联和工会、进行工作大检查、公开党与团、尤其是改革课程与改进教学方法等运动中，都充分作了事先的思想动员，在进行中展开思想酝酿，事后作思想总结。这不独使问题能顺利解决，更提高了师生思想。第二、组织全校师生员工及教职员工家属参加大会，作大报告。第三、开讲经常的政治课，如全校性的“新人生观”、“社会发展史”，分班的“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论”、“新民主主义论”等。全校性的“新人生观”等大课，能密切联系实际，收效较大，分班的“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论”等课收效较小。
    通过这一系列的政治教育，现在大家都感到武汉大学已“人心大变”、“气象一新”了。首先，政治教育消除了一部分人对共产党的恐惧与怀疑，逐渐转为信任与尊敬；党员与青年团员获得了群众的信赖；要求入党入团的人逐日加多。在党外，涌现了大批坚决接受党的领导，在群众中积极推动工作的干部。大多数人对人民民主国家的认识提高了，出现了许多爱人民国家、爱劳动人民的行动。大批学生自动放弃申请人民助学金，教职员自愿减薪。解放前全校学生有百分之八十领“公费”，半年来申请人民助学金的学生由百分之三十五减至百分之十九点七。全校教职员工自愿减低月薪达二万二千零三十分。全校购买公债一万余分（约合工薪分七万余分）。师生员工均展开了节约，今年四月份的用电量仅及解放前的半数；破坏公物与浪费行为已经绝迹。同时，师生们在国际关系上分明认识了敌友。“崇拜美国热”、“恐美病”、“反苏情绪”基本上已消除。对苏联表示了热烈的拥护，如西蒙诺夫和苏联学者以及苏联青年团的来校、去年十月革命节和斯大林寿辰、中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，均获得了全校绝大多数人的热烈欢迎、庆祝和拥护。
    教职员在工作上的雇佣观点与学生为了“升官发财”而学习的思想转变了。随着工作态度与学习态度的改变，工作效率与学习效率逐步提高。据去年年底工作大检查的结果，教职员的工作效率比过去增高了两三倍。学生的政治活动虽然增多，但一般课程的学习成绩比解放前好得多。以新的政治观点为基础的学术研究空气已开始发扬。如生物系与农学院的米丘林学会、中文系的现代文学研究小组，以及法律系、经济系的许多新课程的集体研究和集体教学，都已有相当成绩。师生中的个人主义，宗派主义与自由散漫现象逐渐消除了，出现了新的团结互助精神。连教职员家属也团结起来、组织起来了，大家办托儿所、搞生产、一起听政治报告、组织学习和文娱活动，呈现了愉快、活跃的气氛。同时，生活方面也趋于朴素严肃，没有奢侈腐化的风气。
    由于这些成绩，师生对政治学习的兴趣大大提高。每个星期的政治大课成为大家最关心的事情。从四月份起，在职员中又展开了轮流学习制。平日五个人的工作由三个人来作，而抽调出一部分职员组织学习班，轮流进行专门的政治学习。
