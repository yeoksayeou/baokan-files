Xinhua News Agency, 1st: Central People's Government Committee member and Chief Representative of Overseas Chinese Democratic Personages of the CPPCC, Chen Jiageng, recently issued a written statement refuting President Truman's statement on June 27th. Chen Jiageng began by stating: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and its return to China has long been a fact. The corruption and incompetence of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and their opposition to democracy and oppression of the people led to their overthrow by the Chinese people's revolution. It is a matter of course for the Chinese people to establish their own people's government and carry out their mission to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people have the right to do so and will not allow foreign interference!" Chen Jiageng continued: "Taiwan has been handed over to China for many years, and there is no need to wait for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Today, Chiang Kai-shek's government has been overthrown by the Chinese people, and the Chinese people's government is coming to take over. What reason does the United States have to say that it must wait for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan?" Chen Jiageng concluded: "Taiwan is a neighboring province of Fujian and Guangdong, and overseas Chinese are mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. I call on our overseas Chinese to unite and support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on June 28th, condemning the American imperialists' armed aggression against Chinese territory, and to support the motherland's liberation of Taiwan."

    斥杜鲁门侵略声明  号召华侨支援解放台湾
    【新华社一日讯】中央人民政府委员、人民政协华侨民主人士首席代表陈嘉庚顷发表书面谈话，驳斥美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明。陈嘉庚首称：台湾是我中国的领土，而且归还中国早已成为事实。蒋介石匪帮的贪污无能和反对民主、压迫人民，为中国人民革命所推翻。中国人民建立其自己的人民政府，更执行其解放台湾的任务，这是天经地义的事，中国人民有权这样做、绝不容外国干涉！陈嘉庚继称：台湾交给了中国已好多年，无须要等待对日和约的缔结。今日蒋介石的政府被中国人民打倒了，中国人民的政府要来接收，美国更有何理由说须等待对日和约的缔结？陈嘉庚最后称：台湾为福建、广东的邻省，海外华侨是闽粤人居多，我号召我们海外华侨一致起来拥护我周恩来外长六月二十八日斥责美帝国主义武装侵略中国领土所发表的声明，并支援祖国对台湾的解放。
