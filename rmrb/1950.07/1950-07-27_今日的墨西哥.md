　　Today's Mexico
    Written by Weijin, Translated by Wu Hong
    Legend has it that when Cortes conquered Mexico and returned to Spain, people asked him to describe the new colony. He took a piece of paper, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it on the table. He pointed to the wrinkled paper and said, "That's Mexico!"
    This conqueror keenly expressed the natural geography of Mexico. But Soviet travelers, on their first visit to this country, were not surprised by Mexico's rare scenery, but shocked by the tragic fate of its people.
    The train we were on slowly climbed the mountain, heading towards Mexico City, the capital, more than 2,300 meters above sea level. At every station, travelers were surrounded by hordes of ragged and hungry people.
    However, we were traveling in a wealthy country. Mexico is rich in minerals, possessing almost every useful mineral known to mankind, especially oil, lead, and silver. Official statistics reveal that Mexico's silver production accounts for one-third of the world's total, and lead accounts for one-fifth. Its agricultural products include cotton and wheat, corn and sisal, sugar cane and bananas, coffee and pineapples.
    In the center of Mexico City, there is a magnificent scene of royal palaces, beautiful buildings, hotels, and luxurious restaurants. But the surrounding areas are a maze of narrow, dirty, and foul-smelling alleys, lined with crude houses made of clay. Flies swarm in the sky, crowding the garbage heaps in front of the houses, because these working-class districts lack drainage facilities.
    The living conditions of farmers are even worse. I visited an agricultural area in Hidalgo State near Pachuca and entered a farmer's dwelling. It was a small mud house with a dirt floor. The only furniture was a simple wooden bed shared by the whole family. In the center of the house was a stove for cooking and heating. There was a hole in the roof for smoke to escape, but the smoke did not completely go out, and most of it remained in the house, irritating the eyes and making it difficult to breathe. The whole family had only one pot, which they used to cook coffee, corn, and beans.
    A stooped old woman was baking corn tortillas. She pressed the dough onto a heated stone slab.
    "Why do you bake tortillas like this? Why don't you use a frying pan?"
    "But, sir, frying pans cost money. And you need vegetable oil. I don't need any oil at all with my stone frying pan." The old woman smiled.
    In every poor person's home, you can find the most common tool is a machete, which is used as an axe, knife, and shovel. The slightly wealthier farmers wrap a piece of tin around the tip of their wooden plows, which they show off.
    Although the life of Mexican farmers is very difficult, it is better than that of temporary laborers and hired workers. After all, farmers have their own small piece of land and a house, while hired laborers have nothing but their hands and hungry bellies. Therefore, millions of hired laborers wander around, seeking a livelihood.
    Every year, about 200,000 hired laborers go to the United States. Slave traders recruit them and transport them north in oxcarts to be cruelly exploited by American planters, who reap huge profits from these imported cheap laborers.
    Many farmers go to the mines to find work. Nine out of ten mines belong to American companies, such as the American Smelting Company.
    But here they suffer the same fate. The company's agents first get them drunk with liquor—tequila—and then have them sign contracts that in effect make them slaves. In fact, none of the farmers can read or write, and they simply put their fingerprints on the paper as "signatures." Once he does this, he becomes the company's property. His wages are so low that they cannot even pay for the meager ration of food, and as a result, he has to ask for an advance, which leads to heavy debt.
    The worker ends up as a slave. His debts are inherited by his children, and often the company registers the child as a debtor of the company shortly after birth. As soon as the "debtor" reaches childhood, he is sent to work in the mine. Tortured by operations beyond his strength, he dies as a slave, just as he was born a slave.
    American factories and mines have become regular concentration camps, and workers are confined behind barbed wire. Those who escape are hunted down by soldiers and hounds equipped with rifles and machine guns. The horrific exploitation of Mexican workers can be seen from the following example: a Mexican paver earns only 250 to 300 pesos for building a railway, but an American doing the same job gets 1,500 to 1,800 pesos.
    Mexico has become a happy hunting ground for official, semi-official, and non-official envoys from the United States. It seems that American missions are everywhere, like the delegation sent to investigate mineral deposits. They are busily engaged in inspections and surveys, and are constantly looking for strategic resources. Of course, they are particularly interested in uranium mines for making atomic bombs.
    Americans appear in Mexico as conquerors. They own more than 90 percent of the country's mining industry; foreign capital controls the entire electricity industry, 50 percent of the manufacturing industry, airlines, telephones, trams, and gas supplies. American imperialists are buying up large amounts of land in Mexico, especially land known to contain certain minerals. Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution prohibits the sale of national land to foreigners, but Mexican law does not apply to American capital. Americans own more land in Mexico than the country's own landlords and capitalists. For example, Americans own 80 percent of the land in Baja California and one-third of the entire state of Coahuila. According to a report in mid-January in "The Voice of Mexico" (organ of the Mexican Communist Party - translator's note), the Cananea Cattle Company has occupied 500,000 hectares of land in Sonora. The company's property is surrounded by electrified barbed wire, and armed guards watch day and night, preventing Mexicans from entering the land that has been stolen from them.
    In total, four million hectares of land have been transferred to American business manipulators. With their appetite growing, these modern feudal lords are turning their attention to incorporating northern Mexico, especially Baja California, into the United States.
    Mexico has virtually no heavy industry; its development is deliberately restricted and hindered by American imperialists. The Mexican Iron and Steel Company in Monterrey is Mexico's only large factory, producing steel and some other simple steel products. American commercial interests even hinder the development of Mexico's light industry, arguing that Mexico can do without light industry—doesn't it receive "aid" from the United States?
    Minerals, agricultural raw materials, and fruits are all transported to the United States, some of which are turned into "American-made" finished products and shipped back to Mexico, where they are sold at very high prices.
    During World War II, Mexican businesses decided to build some small-scale factories, but Washington refused to approve the export of American equipment. And when Mexicans, after long periods of trials and difficulties, built some factories, they were quickly suffocated by the dumping of American goods. This was the case with the textile industry, for example, where factories closed down and many workers were abandoned in the streets.
    Americans need a guaranteed and constant supply of oil, lead, zinc, tin, copper, and manganese. What particularly attracts them is Mexican oil. They consider Saudi Arabia to be an "unsafe" place, so they are seizing Mexican oil as the nearest strategic resource.
    By 1938, British and American companies owned 99 percent of Mexico's oil production capacity. In that year, the Mexican government decided to nationalize the oil fields and established its own Mexican Petroleum Company. American monopolists immediately attacked the entire plan. They demanded that Pemex pay approximately $400 million in compensation, based not on the capital invested but on the estimated value of the oil that the company could extract from the Poza Rica oil fields.
    Now the American authorities are going even further and demanding a revision of the 1938 decree. The case against Mexico is falling into the hands of legal swindlers like Dulles, whose Sullivan & Cromwell law firm has undertaken to represent the interests of Pemex. Pressure is also being applied through the State Department. At the State Department, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs is Miller, formerly a partner in the Dulles firm and for a time a lawyer for Mobil Oil.
    At the end of February, Mexican progressive newspapers reported that Pemex had violated the March 18, 1938 decree by entering into a contract with the American Tom Williams Company, allowing it to extract oil in Cerro Azul. Pauley, notorious for his disreputable grain deals, has obtained preferential exploration rights over an area of 1,500 square miles for his Mexican American Independent Oil Company. The oil extracted by the Pauley Company is exempt from all taxes.
    Several other American companies, including Cities Service Company, are currently conducting exploration work throughout the country.
    Finally, in February, Eugene Black, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, arrived in Mexico on a mission to investigate Mexico's electricity facilities and negotiate a $200 million loan, the price of which is Mexico handing over its oil fields to American monopoly capital.
    Mexico's ruling clique has accepted the basic terms of the Clayton Plan; they have extended the Mexican-American trade agreement, which is detrimental to national interests, and have given American companies certain privileges on very favorable terms. Not long ago, at the behest of Washington, the peso was devalued, resulting in a further reduction in people's incomes, rising prices, and a forced lowering of living standards.
    One of the most common ways to get rich quick is to sign road construction contracts with the government. A man named Camacho accumulated a huge fortune when he was Minister for Transport, securing contracts for himself to build the highway from Mexico City to Tuxpan. Camacho became one of the richest men in the country, owning so much property that it is said that he himself did not know where some of it was. His villa is a veritable medieval fortress, with ditches around the large house and guards patrolling the watchtowers on the high stone walls day and night. A small group of attendants, servants, armed bodyguards, and a harem of concubines make up the inhabitants of Camacho's kingdom.
    Mexico's propaganda machine is trying to spread cosmopolitanism. Publications that imitate American materialism attempt to instill in readers the idea that Mexicans are "feeble-minded," lack the ability to manage the country, and therefore must give up their major economic position to the United States. Reactionary newspapers publish articles that slander and libel the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    But despite the frenzied anti-communist movement, the shamelessness of the pro-American National Action Party, and the activities of the Catholic clergy directed by the Vatican, the people's movement against the oppressors is growing. The sight of Mexico's national wealth being sold off has aroused the strongest resentment among the masses. For example, the people have long demanded that the state confiscate the estates occupied by Americans and others and distribute this land to landless farmers.
    American imperialism has made extensive use of its trade union stooges to suppress the Mexican working people. In November 1949, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the so-called International Confederation of Free Trade Unions founded in London, and the Pan-American Labor Confederation associated with it, were all engaged in deceptive and destructive trade union activities in Mexico. They collude with the police and American secret agents. The head of the liaison office of the Pan-American Labor Confederation is Langlier, an agent of the American Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    The reactionaries in Mexico are imitating Washington. Not long ago, the police once again carried out a "purge" of left-wing elements. These "purges" were carried out in every rogue way, such as searching progressive newspapers and attacking progressive leaders.
    At the beginning of this year, when the automobile drivers went on strike, the police searched their union headquarters, killing two workers, injuring fifty, and arresting about a thousand, for the strange crime of violating traffic regulations! A petition march by drivers to the president demanding improved conditions was also violently dispersed by the police: seven people died, many were injured, and two hundred were imprisoned.
    The Americans are very happy in this environment of police lawlessness and terror. You can see cheerful, gum-chewing figures standing on crowded streets, spitting impudently, looking around with the eyes of an occupier, and not at all moved by the hostile eyes of passers-by. Mexicans still call them by the contemptuous name "Gringo," which dates back to the time when Mexico and the United States fought a war.
    One day, on a street in Mexico, I saw a large crowd of people gathered around a pool of blood on the road. It turned out that an American driving a Cadillac at high speed had run over a family. The child died on the spot, the father's legs were crushed, and the mother went mad with fright.
    A policeman stopped the car. But the American driver angrily pulled out his business card and claimed that his car had "insurance against all accidents." He said carelessly, "Let them go to the insurance company."
    The policeman politely saluted, the murderer drove away, and the case was closed, although the atrocity had aroused strong protests from the masses.
    The American authorities like to show their military might in Mexico. On national holidays, Washington sends bomber squadrons to fly low over the capital to express "good neighborliness" and "goodwill."
    But the impact of these "shows of force" on the people is diminishing. The working people are responding to the attacks of the reactionaries by strengthening their struggle for their rights. In the Mexican capital, 5,000 drivers and thousands of gas station workers went on strike to demand the release of their arrested comrades. Finally, the authorities were forced to release those who had been imprisoned. More than 15,000 people attended the funeral of the victims of police terror, and the police did not dare to interfere.
    In mid-January, employees of the telephone bureau in Mexico City went on strike and only returned to work after their demands were met. In early March, more than 4,000 workers in the government-controlled copper and silver mines in Bajío went on strike and won a 6 percent increase in wages. In the same month, 9,000 miners went on strike in Fresnillo, Vinas Mines, Leer Mines, and Bajío mines.
    The vast majority of the Mexican people feel that the struggle for peace is a matter of vital importance to them. The American Conference for the Defense of Peace, held in Mexico City last September, laid the foundation for an organized struggle to defend peace. The Progressive Youth Congress, held this January, decided to establish a youth organization as "an instrument for strengthening the Mexican democratic movement and cooperating with democratic and socialist countries, and fighting against war-mongers and their international agents."
    The Mexican Peace Committee, led by former Navy Minister Jara, is organizing rallies across the country to spread the Stockholm Resolution of the World Peace Congress. Local peace committees are being established in factories, working-class districts, villages, and schools.
    This is today's Mexico, stripped of the exterior decorations that are so prominently depicted in travel brochures prepared for the wealthy.

　　今日的墨西哥
    吴洪译  维也金著
    传说当戈蒂斯征服了墨西哥之后回到了西班牙，人家要他描述一下这个新的殖民地，他拿了一张纸，将它搓成一团扔在桌子上。他指着那张皱摺不堪的纸面说道：“那就是墨西哥！”
    这位征服者很敏快地表达了墨西哥的自然地理情况。但是苏联的旅行者初次拜访这个国家时，对于墨西哥的罕见的风景并不感到惊异，而那里的人民的悲惨的命运却是使他们震惊的。
    我们乘坐的火车慢慢地爬上了山，走向拔海二千三百公尺以上的首都墨西哥城。在每一个车站上旅客们都被成群的衣衫褴褛和饥饿的人们所包围。
    然而，我们所游历的是一个富有的国家呀。墨西哥有着丰富的矿产，有着几乎人类所知道的一切有用的矿产，特别是石油、铅和银。官方统计披露墨西哥银的生产量占世界三分之一，铅占五分之一。它的农产品有棉花和小麦、玉蜀黍和西沙尔麻、蔗糖和香蕉、咖啡和菠萝。
    在墨西哥城中心呈现着一幅堂堂的皇宫，美丽的大厦、饭店和奢华的酒店等的图画。但四周却是错杂、狭隘、污秽、恶臭的小巷，两旁排列着粘土盖成的龃龊小屋。满天飞着苍蝇；它们拥挤在屋前的垃圾堆上，因为这些工人住区没有沟渠的设备。
    农民的生活情形更坏。我拜访了伊达尔哥州靠近帕楚卡地方的农业区，走进了一所农民的住屋。这是一个泥地的小土房子，唯一的家具是一张全家共用的简单的木床。房子中央有一个作饭和取暖用的火炉。屋顶有一个通烟的洞，但是烟并没有完全出去，大部还留在屋里，侵入眼睛并使你难以呼吸。全家就只有一个锅，煮咖啡、玉蜀黍和豆子等都用它。
    一个伛偻的老妇人正在烤玉蜀黍饼，她将面贴在一块烘热了的石板上面。
    “你为什么这样烘饼，为什么不用煎锅呢？”
    “但是，先生，煎锅是要花钱买的。而且还要用菜油。用我的石板煎锅是用不着一点菜油的。”老妇人微笑了。
    在每一个穷苦人的家里，你可以发现最普通的工具是弯刀，它当斧头、刀、以及铲子用。较为富有一点的农民在木犁的犁嘴上包上一块锡片，他们是拿这个来炫耀的。
    虽然墨西哥农民的生活是很困苦的，但比起打短工的雇农和雇工是好多了。农民毕竟有他自己的一小块土地和住房，雇农则除去他的双手和饥饿的肚皮外一无所有。因此，数以百万计的雇农便到处流浪，寻觅生计。
    每年约有二十万的雇农到美国去。贩奴商人招募了他们，用牛车运到北方去受美国种植园主们的残酷剥削，种植园主们在这些移进的贱价劳工身上榨获厚利。
    许多农民到矿山去寻找工作，十分之九的矿山属于美国公司，例如，美国熔炼公司等等。
    但是在这里他们所遭受的是同样的命运。公司的代理人先用烈酒—龙舌兰酒—灌醉了他们，然后要他们签订了事实上使他们成为奴隶的合同。实际上没有一个农民是会读会写的，他们只是在纸上盖了手印算作“签名”。一旦他这样作了，他事实上便变成了公司的财产。他的工资是这样的低微。甚至不能支付那只够半饱的配给口粮，结果他只得请求预支而致负债累累。
    工人结局是成了一个奴隶。他的债务由他的孩子们去继承，常常在孩子刚一出世不久，公司便把他登记为公司的一个债务人。这位“债务人”一到童年，便被送到矿里去作工去。因为被他力所不及的操作所折磨，像他生下来便是奴隶一样，他作为奴隶而死去。
    美国的工厂和矿厂已变成正规的集中营，工人们被禁闭在铁丝网后面。逃跑的人被配有来福枪和机关枪的士兵和猎狗所追踪。对墨西哥工人的骇人的剥削可由下面的例子看出：一个墨西哥的铺路工人在建筑铁路的工作中只赚到二百五十至三百比索，但作同样工作的一个美国人却得到一千五百至一千八百比索。
    墨西哥已成为美国官方、半官方以及非官方的特使们的快乐的狩猎场所。似乎到处到是美国使团，就如那个派来调查矿藏的代表团一样，它们忙碌地从事视察和探测工作，并且不断地在寻找战略资源。当然，他们特别感兴趣的就是制造原子弹的铀矿。
    美国人以征服者的姿态出现在墨西哥。他们拥有全国百分之九十以上的采矿工业；外国的资本控制了整个的电气工业，百分之五十的制造工业、航空线、电话、电车以及煤气供应等。美帝国主义者们正在墨西哥大量购买土地，特别是那些已知含有某种矿藏的土地。墨西哥宪法第二十七条规定禁止出卖本国土地与外国人，但是墨西哥的法律对于美国资本是不起作用的。美国人在墨西哥所拥有的土地比本国的地主和资本家还多，例如美国人占有了下加利福尼亚州的百分之八十的土地，占有了科阿乌伊拉州整个地区的三分之一的土地。据“墨西哥之声”（墨共机关刊物——译注）在一月中旬报导康纳尼亚牧牛公司在索诺拉州已占有土地五十万公顷。公司财产的四周设有通电的铁丝网，并有武装哨兵昼夜在看守着，不准墨西哥人进入这些从他们那里掠夺去的土地。
    总之，有四百万公顷土地已转入到美国商业操纵者手中。胃口是愈吃愈大，这些近代的封建巨头们已在转念头想把墨西哥的北部，特别是下加利福尼亚州地方并入美国。
    墨西哥实际上没有重工业；重工业的发展受到美帝国主义者有意地束缚和阻碍。在蒙特勒的墨西哥熔铁公司是墨西哥仅有的一个大工厂，生产钢及其他一些简单的钢产品。美国的商业利益甚至阻扰着墨西哥轻工业的发展，理由是墨西哥没有轻工业也可以过得去——它不是得到美国的“援助”吗？
    矿产，农业原料和水果都运到美国去，其中有些变成“美国制”的成品运回墨西哥来，并以非常高昂的价格出售。
    在第二次世界大战时期，墨西哥商界决定建立一些小规模的工厂，但是华盛顿方面拒绝批准美国的设备输出。而当墨西哥人经过长时期的尝试和困难，建立起一些工厂时，它们很快地就被美货的倾销所窒息了。例如纺织工业的遭遇就是这样的，工厂倒闭了，许多工人被弃于街头。
    美国人需要得到石油、铅、锌、锡、铜和锰的有保证而经常的供给。特别吸引他们的是墨西哥的石油。他们认为沙地阿拉伯是一个“不保险”的地方，因此他们正在攫取墨西哥的石油作为最近的战略资源。
    至一九三八年时，英美公司占有墨西哥石油生产能力百分之九十九。在那一年墨西哥政府决定将油田收为国有，并为此设立了自己的墨西哥石油公司。美国的独占资本家立即一致攻击整个计划。他们要求付给萨波罗公司大约四亿美元的补偿费，这个要求根据的不是所投入的资本，而是该公司从波沙黎加油田中可能提炼的石油的估价。
    现在美国当局更进一步要求修改一九三八年的法令。对付墨西哥的案件正落在杜勒斯之类的法律骗子手中，他的苏利文克仑姆威尔法律事务所已承担代表萨波罗公司的利益。通过国务院方面也加了些压力。在国务院，专管泛美事务的助理国务卿是米勒，以前杜勒斯公司的一个股东，有一个时期还做过美孚油公司的律师。
    二月底，墨西哥的进步报纸报导，墨西哥油公司违反了一九三八年三月十八日的法令，与美国汤姆威廉士公司订立了一个合同，准许它在非哈得奥罗采油。由于他的不名誉的谷物买卖而臭名远扬的波利，已为他的墨西哥美国独立石油公司获得了在面积一千五百平方英里上的优先探测权。波利公司所采得的石油被豁免一切捐税。
    一些其他的美国公司，其中包括城市服务公司，目前正在该国各地进行探测工作。
    最后，二月里国际复兴开发银行行长布莱克到了墨西哥，他的使命是调查墨西哥的电力设备以及进行二亿美元贷款的谈判，墨西哥接受这笔贷款的化价是把它的油田交给美国垄断资本。
    墨西哥的统治集团已接受了克莱顿计划的基本条款；他们已延长了损害国家利益的墨美贸易协定，并且在非常有利于美国的条件下给了美国公司某些特权。不久以前奉华盛顿之命而把比索贬值，结果人民的收入更加减少了，物价在高涨，人民的生活水平亦被迫降低了。
    一个最普遍的发横财的方法就是与政府签订筑路合同。一个叫卡马卓的在做交通部长时积蓄了巨大的一笔财产，为自己招揽了修筑墨西哥城到杜克斯班的公路的合同。卡马卓成了国内一个最有钱的人，拥有许多房地产，传说它们多得有些连他自己都不知道在那里。他的别墅是一个十足的中世纪堡垒，大房子的四周是沟渠，日夜都有卫兵在高石墙上的守塔里放哨。一小队侍从，家仆，带枪的保镖和一群妻妾组成了卡马卓王国的居民。
    墨西哥的宣传机器尽力传布世界主义。仿效美国的拜金主义的出版物企图将墨西哥人民是“低能”的观念灌输给读者，说墨西哥人缺乏管理国家的能力，因此必需把主要的经济地位让给美国。反动报纸发表中伤及诬蔑苏联和人民民主国家的文章。
    但是不顾疯狂的反共运动、亲美的国民行动党的无耻以及由梵蒂冈指挥的天主教僧侣集团的活动，人民反抗压迫者的运动日益增长。眼见墨西哥国家财富之被出卖激起了群众最强烈的忿恨，例如，人民早就要求国家没收美国人及其他所占有的庄园，把这些土地分配给无地的农民。
    美帝广泛地利用了他们的工会走狗极力压制墨西哥的劳动人民。一九四九年十一月美国的劳联、产联，在伦敦成立的所谓国际自由工会联盟以及与之有联系的泛美劳工联合会，都在墨西哥进行欺骗和破坏工会的活动。他们与警察和美国的特务互相勾结。泛美劳工联合会的联络局的头子便是美国联邦调查局的特务朗基尔。
    墨西哥的反动派仿效着华盛顿。不久以前警察又一次进行了对左倾分子的“清洗”，这些“清洗”是用一切流氓方式进行的，如搜查进步报纸，攻击进步领袖等等。
    今年年初汽车司机罢工的时候，警察搜查了他们的工会总部，打死了两个工人，伤了五十人并逮捕了约一千人，他们奇怪的罪名是违反了交通规则！司机向总统要求改善条件的请愿游行，同样被警察的暴力驱散：死了七人，伤了很多并且有二百人进了监狱。
    美国佬在这个警察的无法无天和恐怖的环境里到是很高兴的。你可以看到愉快的、嚼着口香糖的人物站在拥挤的大街上，放肆地吐痰，用占领者的眼光望着他的周围，一点也不为过路人敌意的眼光所动。墨西哥人还是以“金哥”这一轻蔑的名字称呼着他们，它的由来还远在从前墨西哥与美国打仗的时候。
    有一天，在墨西哥的一条大街上，我看见一大堆人围着马路上的一滩血。原来是一个以高速度驾着卡德立克汽车的美国人撞倒了一家人。小孩当场就死去了，父亲的双腿已被压断，母亲由于惊骇而发了疯。
    一个警察拦住了汽车。但是驾车的美国人气冲冲地掏出了他的名片，宣称他的汽车已有“对一切意外事故的保险”。他毫不在意地说：“让他们到保险公司去好了。”
    警察有礼貌地敬了礼，杀人犯开着汽车走了，案子不了了之，虽然暴行已激起了群众剧烈的抗议。
    美国当局很喜欢在墨西哥显示他们的武力。在全国性的纪念日子里，华盛顿派遣了轰炸机队在首都作低空飞行以表示“睦邻精神”和“善意”。
    但是这些“武力示威”在人民中的影响日益减小。劳动人民以加强争取他们权利的斗争来回答反动派的进攻。在墨西哥首都的五千司机和数千个汽车服务站工人为了要求释放他们被捕的同志而举行了罢工。最后，当局被迫释放了被监禁的人。一万五千人以上参加了警察恐怖的牺牲者的葬礼，警察不敢加以干涉。
    一月中旬墨西哥城的电话局的职工举行罢工，而只在获得了他们的要求后才复工。三月初，政府控制的巴卓加山的铜矿和银矿中的四千多工人举行了罢工，赢得了工资的百分之六的增加。同月中，九千矿工在弗来斯尼罗，比纳尔斯矿，利尔矿山及巴卓加等矿举行了罢工。
    广大的墨西哥人民感觉到争取和平的斗争是他们切身的问题。去年九月在墨西哥城召开的美洲拥护和平大会奠定了有组织地保卫和平的斗争基础。今年一月召开的进步青年大会决定了建立一个青年组织，作为“加强墨西哥民主运动以及与民主及社会主义国家合作、反对战争贩子及他们的国际代理人的斗争工具”。
    以前任海军部长哈拉为领袖之一的墨西哥和平委员会，正在全国组织集会以传播世界和平大会的斯德哥尔摩决议。各地和平委员会正在工厂、工人区、乡村及学校中建立起来。
    这就是今日的墨西哥，卸去了在为有钱人预备的旅行手册中如此显赫描写的外表装饰的墨西哥。
