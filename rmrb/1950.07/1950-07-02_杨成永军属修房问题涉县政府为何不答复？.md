　　Why Has She County Government Not Responded to the Housing Repair Issue of Military Family Member Yang Chengyong?
To the Editorial Board:
    Our unit's soldier, Comrade Yang Chengyong, is from Xiliaocheng Village, She County, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province. He joined the army in 1945. He has consistently been proactive in his work and has been commended for his achievements, being selected as a model worker.
    Last year, during the rainy season, his house collapsed due to disrepair and heavy rains. At that time, his family (consisting of only a woman and a child) requested village cadres to help make adobe bricks and resolve some timber difficulties (this is what he reported to us), but the village did not address it. His family then went to the district office, but it was also not resolved. After Comrade Yang Chengyong reported this to us, we asked him to encourage his family to do as much as possible themselves and overcome the idea of solely relying on the government. At the same time, in December of last year, we sent an official letter to the She County Government, asking them to investigate the actual situation, provide appropriate assistance, and inform us of the handling situation.
    After the first official letter was sent, we did not receive a reply. According to a letter from Comrade Yang's family, the housing repair issue has still not been resolved. We sent another letter to the She County Government in February of this year, expressing our opinions on the housing repair issue of Yang Chengyong's family and inquiring about the whereabouts of the first official letter. However, we still did not receive a reply. Afterward, his family sent another letter saying that the housing repair issue had not been resolved.
    The rainy season has arrived again this year, and Comrade Yang is very anxious and wants to ask for leave to go back and deal with it. Because we are busy with work and feel that his return may not necessarily solve the problem, we did not approve his leave. In addition to allocating 100 jin of millet from our unit's savings to subsidize his family, we also made suggestions to the She County Government through the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office at the end of April. However, there are still no results. Comrade Yang is anxious and uneasy whenever it rains, and his mood is greatly affected. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the local government.
    We have taken a cautious approach in handling this issue. We were afraid that Comrade Yang's report was one-sided or that his demands were too high, so we repeatedly asked the local government to "investigate the situation and handle it according to the circumstances." However, we have never received a reply.
    We believe that no matter how this matter should be handled, the She County Government should have responded to our letter and expressed its attitude, and should not have ignored it. We hope that the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the She County Government will investigate this matter and reply to us.

### 杨成永军属修房问题涉县政府为何不答复？

　　杨成永军属修房问题涉县政府为何不答复？编辑同志：
    我部战士杨成永同志，河北省邯郸专区涉县西辽城村人，一九四五年参军。他工作一贯积极，曾经在工作中立过功，被选为模范工作者。
    去年雨季，他家中房子因年久失修，被大雨淋坍。当时他家（家中只有一个女人、一个小孩）要求村干部帮助打土坯及解决一部分木料困难（这是他向我们反映的），但村中未予处理。他家又去找区公所，亦未解决。杨成永同志向我们反映后，我们要他动员家人尽可能地亲自动手，克服单纯依靠政府的思想。同时，我们于去年十二月向涉县政府去了公函，请他们查明真实情况，酌情帮助解决，并望将处理情形函告我们。
    第一次公函去后，我们未接到复信。据杨同志家中来信说，修房问题仍未获得解决。我们又在今年二月份再向涉县政府去信，对杨成永家修房问题提出意见，并查询第一次公函的下落。但仍未获复信。事后他家中又来信，说修房问题始终未解决。
    今年雨季又到了，杨同志很着急，要请假回去处理。我们因为工作忙，而且觉得他回去不一定能解决问题，故未准其请假。我们除自本部节约粮中拨出小米一百斤以资补助其家庭外，又于四月底经过邯郸专区公署向涉县政府再度提出意见。但至今仍无结果。杨同志每逢下雨时心中焦燥不安，情绪很受影响。他对地方政府表示不满。
    我们在处理这个问题上是采取审慎的态度的。我们恐怕杨同志反映的情况片面、或要求过高，所以一再函请当地政府“查明情况，依情处理”。但始终未得到回信。
    我们认为，无论这件事应该如何处理，涉县政府对我们的信是应该答复并表示态度的，不应置之不理。希望邯郸专署及涉县政府查究这事，并答复我们。
