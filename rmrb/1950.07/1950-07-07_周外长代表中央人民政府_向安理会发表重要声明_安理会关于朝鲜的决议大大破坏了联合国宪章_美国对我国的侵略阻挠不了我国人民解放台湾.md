Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 6th, issuing an important statement on behalf of our Central People's Government. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Secretary-General Trygve Lie at Success Lake and to all member states of the Security Council:

I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, declare that the resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council on June 27, under the instigation and manipulation of the United States government, requesting member states of the United Nations to assist the South Korean authorities, supports American armed aggression, interferes in the internal affairs of Korea, and undermines world peace. Furthermore, this resolution was passed without the participation of the two permanent member states, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and is therefore clearly illegal. The United Nations Charter stipulates that the United Nations shall not be authorized to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state, and the Security Council's resolution of June 27 violates this important principle of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the Security Council's resolution on the Korean issue is not only without any legal effect, but also greatly undermines the United Nations Charter. The actions of UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie regarding the Korean issue are exacerbating this damage.

At the same time, U.S. President Truman's statement on June 27 regarding the use of force to prevent my People's Republic of China from liberating Taiwan, and the U.S. Navy's intrusion into the coastal waters of Taiwan, is a blatant act of aggression that completely violates the principle of the United Nations Charter that no member state shall use force to infringe upon the territorial integrity or political independence of any other state. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This is not only a universally recognized historical fact, but is also affirmed by the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the status quo after Japan's surrender. The United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General are silent about this open act of aggression by the United States government, abandoning their responsibility to maintain world peace and becoming tools to comply with the policies of the United States government. I now declare on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China: No matter what military obstruction the U.S. government takes, the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. I hereby submit this for your consideration.

Zhou Enlai
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
July 6, 1950, in Beijing

　　周外长代表中央人民政府
    向安理会发表重要声明
    安理会关于朝鲜的决议大大破坏了联合国宪章
    美国对我国的侵略阻挠不了我国人民解放台湾
    【新华社六日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长，于六日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，代表我中央人民政府发表重要声明，电文如下：成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生并转安全理事会各会员国：
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府声明：联合国安全理事会于六月二十七日在美国政府指使和操纵下所通过的关于要求联合国会员国协助南朝鲜当局的决议，是支持美国武装侵略、干涉朝鲜内政和破坏世界和平的，并且这一决议是在没有中华人民共和国和苏联两个常任理事国参加下通过的，显然是非法的。联合国宪章规定不得授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，而安全理事会六月二十七日的决议正违犯了联合国宪章这一重要原则。因此，安全理事会关于朝鲜问题的决议，不仅毫无法律效力，并且大大破坏了联合国宪章。而联合国秘书长赖伊先生关于朝鲜问题的行动，正加深了这一破坏性。
    同时，美国总统杜鲁门在六月二十七日关于以武力阻止我中华人民共和国解放台湾的声明和美国海军侵入我台湾沿海的行动，是彻底破坏联合国宪章关于任何会员国不得使用武力侵害任何其他国家之领土完整或政治独立的原则的公开侵略行为。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这不仅是举世公认的历史事实，而且也是开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言及日本投降后的现状所肯定的。联合国安全理事会及联合国秘书长对于美国政府这一公然侵略行动却又一声不响，放弃自己维护世界和平的职责，并成为顺从美国政府政策的工具。我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府声明：不管美国政府采取任何军事阻挠，中国人民抱定决心，必将要解放台湾。专此奉达，即希                查照。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
    一九五○年七月六日于北京
