　　Yellow River Diversion to Benefit the Wei River Project Completed Survey; Construction to Begin After This Year's Flood Season
    [This newspaper dispatch] Reported by Chen Shu of the Yellow River Diversion Survey Team: Under the slogan of "Turning the harmful river into a beneficial river," the survey for the Yellow River Diversion to Benefit the Wei River project, the first time in the history of the lower reaches of the Yellow River to utilize Yellow River water to benefit the people, has been completed and construction will begin after this year's flood season. The surveying work for this project was undertaken by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's Yellow River Diversion to Benefit the Wei River Project Survey Team. The team departed from Kaifeng for the Zhandian construction site on the north bank of the Yellow River on December 28th last year, and began surveying on January 4th this year. In order to complete the surveying task ahead of schedule, the First Survey Team of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission was transferred to assist on May 1st. The entire surveying task was completed on June 14th, lasting a total of five months and ten days. The survey area extends from Nan Jia in Wuzhi in the west, to near Jixian City in the north, from west of the iron bridge on the north bank of the Yellow River in the south, to east of the Wei River in Xinxiang City in the east. A total of more than 400 kilometers of survey lines were completed, 62 topographic maps were drawn, and the surveyed area reached 1,390 square kilometers; 71 cross-sections of the Yellow River and Wei River were measured, and flow rates were measured eight times; ten permanent benchmark stations were established. It is expected that construction will begin after this year's flood season, and the entire project will be completed by the end of 1951.
    The Yellow River Diversion to Benefit the Wei River project involves diverting water from the west of the iron bridge on the north bank of the Yellow River, flowing along the main canal east of the Jinghan Railway into the Wei River in Xinxiang City. At the same time, east and west canals will be excavated and repaired on both sides of the railway, which can irrigate approximately 400,000 mu of farmland in Xinxiang, Wuzhi, Huojia, Yuanyang, Jixian and other counties. After the Wei River's flow increases, it will be navigable for ordinary 200-ton steamships; the four drops along the main canal can also be used for hydroelectric power generation.

　　引黄济卫工程测量完毕
    今年汛期后即开始施工
    【本报讯】引黄测量队陈述报道：在“变害河为利河”的口号下，黄河下游历史上第一次利用黄水造福人民的引黄济卫工程已测量完毕，将于本年汛期后开始施工。该项工程的测量工作，是由黄河水利委员会引黄济卫工程测量队所担任。该队于去年十二月二十八日即由开封赶赴黄河北岸的詹店工地，今年一月四日开始测量。为提早完成测量任务，又于五月一日调来黄河水利委员会第一测量队协助工作。现全部测量任务已于六月十四日完成，共历时五个月零十天。测量区域，西起武陟南贾，北迄汲县城附近，南起黄河北岸铁桥以西，东至新乡市卫河以东一带。计完成测线四百余公里，绘制地形图六十二张，测量面积达一千三百九十平方公里；测量黄河及卫河断面七十一个，测量流量八次；设置永久水准测站十处。预计本年汛期后开始施工，全部工程于一九五一年年底即可完成。
    引黄济卫工程，系由黄河北岸铁桥以西引水，沿京汉路东侧总干渠流入新乡市卫河。同时在铁路两侧挖修东、西两条干渠，可灌溉新乡、武陟、获嘉、原阳、汲县等县约四十万亩耕地。卫河流量增加后，普通可航行二百吨的汽船；沿总干渠的四个跌水，还可利用水力发电。
