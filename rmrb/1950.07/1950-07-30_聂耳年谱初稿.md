　　A Preliminary Chronology of Nie Er
    Sun Shen
    1912, February 14th, Born in Kunming, Yunnan. His father, Nie Hongyi, was a doctor, and his mother, Peng, was also a doctor. He had three older brothers and two younger sisters.
    1915, Four years old. His father passed away, and the family fell into dire straits.
    1917, Six years old. Entered the primary school attached to Kunming Normal School, where he studied for four years, graduating from junior primary.
    1921, Ten years old. Entered the senior department of the private Qiushi Primary School, where he excelled in music throughout the school.
    1925, Fourteen years old. Admitted to the ninth class of the Joint Middle School. Due to family financial difficulties, he borrowed tuition to enroll.
    1927, Sixteen years old. Graduated from middle school. His family could no longer afford to support his education, so he was told to find a job. However, he was admitted to the Foreign Language Group of the Provincial Normal School (on government scholarship).
    1928, Although his studies were on government scholarship, it was still difficult to make ends meet. Coincidentally, the 16th Army was recruiting soldiers in Yunnan, so he signed up and was sent to Chenzhou, Hunan. After a week as a private, he was promoted to clerical sergeant and later incorporated into the Guangzhou Officer Corps. Soon after, the Officer Corps was disbanded, and he passed the entrance exam to the Guangdong Provincial Drama Institute (Director: Mr. Ouyang Yuqian). He left after three weeks due to a mismatch of interests.
    1929, Eighteen years old. In the spring of this year, he returned to Kunming to resume his studies in the original class of the Provincial Normal School.
    1930, Nineteen years old. Graduated from the Provincial Normal School in July. The family's life became even more difficult. Fortunately, Xue Gengyu, a businessman from Fujian, who owned Shen Zhuang in Shanghai, dealing in textiles and cigarette business, invited him to work as a shop assistant. In Shanghai, he developed a great interest in music and began to study the violin on his own.
    1931, Twenty years old. In March, Xue's business failed, and he lost his job along with him, feeling lost and depressed. In May, he was admitted to Li Jinhui's Mingyue Dance Troupe as a violinist. At this time, he had joined the work of the Shanghai Anti-Imperialist League through his fellow townsman Zhang Tianxu. He also met Tian Han at this time. Through his introduction, he joined the music group of the Soviet Union Friendship Association, where he became friends with comrades such as Zhang Shu, Ren Guang, and Lü Ji, working together on classical works. On September 6th, "Mingyue" signed a contract with Lianhua Company to join the Lianhua Orchestra. His first collaboration with Tian Han was the "Mining Song" in Lianhua's production "Motherhood's Light." These songs were recorded in the music department of Baidai Company, which was managed by Ren Guang. Lyricists and composers could each earn 25 yuan. At the end of the year, Ren Guang, Sun Shiyi and others organized a new song audition, achieving a decisive victory over yellow music. At this time, he officially found a foreign teacher to teach him the violin, but sometimes he still had to pawn his clothes to pay tuition.
    After the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident broke out, feeling the increasing national crisis and with Li still producing decadent music, he immediately left "Mingyue" and went to Beiping in August. He applied for the Academy of Arts in Ping but was not admitted, so he followed a private tutor, Tonoff, to learn the violin. After two months, he returned to Shanghai to work in Lianhua Factory No. 1 as a musician. He also carried out left-wing theatrical activities in schools and factories.
    1933, Twenty-two years old. During this period, due to frequent contact with many progressive art workers, his thinking greatly improved. He clearly recognized that "in the present time of imperialist occupation of the Northeast and the massacre of the masses, music, like other arts, is shouting on behalf of the masses. The masses inevitably demand new music with new content and performance, and new attitudes from composers. Revolutionary composers should create revolutionary music that also maintains a high level of artistic quality." In this year, he and Zhang Shu joined the Chinese Communist Party successively through Tian Han's introduction. In August, he was dismissed by Lianhua due to illness.
    1934, Twenty-three years old. Composed music for Tian Han's three-act play "Song of Returning Spring," including "Farewell to Nanyang," "Plum Blossom Girl," and "Spring Returns." On April 1st, he joined Baidai Company to assist Ren Guang in recording work and to study harmony and counterpoint. He resigned from "Baidai" at the end of November. In December, he worked on the dubbing for "Song of the Big Road." Composed the theme song for the film "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm," written by Tian Han, directed by Ying Yunwei, and starring Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er, produced by Diantong Company, which is now the national anthem of the People's Republic of China, "March of the Volunteers."
    1935, Twenty-four years old. Worked in Lianhua Factory No. 2. In April, due to the mass arrest of left-wing literary and art workers and the deterioration of the situation in Shanghai, and also in order to study further, he planned to go to Japan first, then to Europe. He departed from Shanghai on April 15th and arrived in Tokyo on the 18th. Just as he had completed his first three-month plan and was about to start his second three-month plan, he was unfortunately swallowed by the waves of the Pacific Ocean due to a swimming accident.
    Note: This chronology is based on the existing materials. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to consult widely, and errors and omissions are inevitable. His works rarely specify the year of creation, so they could not be completely included in the chronology. It is hoped that comrades who know about his life will supplement and correct it, so that a detailed chronology can be compiled in the future.

　　聂耳年谱初稿
    孙慎
    一九一二年二月十四日生于云南昆明。父亲聂鸿仪是一个医生，母亲彭氏也是医生。他有三个哥哥和二个娣联络。
    一九一五年  四岁。他的父亲逝世，家庭堕入悲惨的境地。
    一九一七年  六岁。入昆明师范附小读书，凡四年，初小毕业。
    一九二一年  十岁。入私立求实小学高级部读书，音乐为全校之冠。
    一九二五年  十四岁。考入联合中学第九班，因为家庭经济困难，借了学费入学。
    一九二七年  十六岁。中学毕业，家庭实在不能再供给他读书，叫他去找职业。可是他考入省立师范外国语组（公费）去读书。
    一九二八年  读书虽是公费，但维持生活还是困难。适十六军到云南招兵，他就报名参加，被送到湖南郴州，一个星期后从列兵改成文书上士，后又编入广州的军官团。不久军官团遣散，又考入广东省立戏剧研究所（所长为欧阳予倩先生）三个礼拜后，因兴趣未合离去。
    一九二九年  十八岁。是年春天，仍回昆明入省师原班肄业。
    一九三零年  十九岁。七月从省师毕业。家庭生活越发艰难。恰好福建商人薛耕愚，在上海开有申庄，经营匹头和纸烟生意，约他去当店员。在上海他对音乐发生极大兴趣，开始自习小提琴。
    一九三一年  二十岁。三月，薛的商业失败，他也跟着失业，旁徨而苦闷。五月，考入黎锦晖的明月歌舞团当小提琴师。此时他已由其同乡张天虚的关系参加上海反帝大同盟的工作。也在此时认识田汉。由其介绍参加苏联之友社音乐组，与张曙、任光、吕骥诸同志交好，共同作典。九月六日“明月”与联华公司签订合同加入联华乐队，第一次与田汉合作是联华出品“母性之光”里的“开矿歌”。这些歌曲即在任光主持的百代公司音乐部收音。作词与曲者可各得二十五元。年终由任光、孙师毅等主办新歌曲试唱会，获得对黄色歌曲断然的胜利。此时他正式找到一个外国教师教他提琴，但有时仍不免当了衣服去交学费。
    “一·二八”沪战爆发，因感民族危机日急，而黎仍作靡靡之音，随即脱离“明月”，于八月去北平。在平投考艺术学院未被录取，乃跟私人教员托诺夫（TONOFF）学琴，二个月后仍回上海进联华一厂担任音乐工作。并去学校和工厂开展左翼演剧活动。
    一九三三年  二十二岁。这一时期由于经常和许多进步的艺术工作者相接触，他的思想有了很大进步。他清楚地认识了“在帝国主义占领东北，屠杀大众的现在，音乐和其他艺术一样，是代替大众在呐喊，大众必然要求新音乐的新的内容和演奏，和作曲家的新的态度。接受革命的作曲家们，要编出革命的，同时保持高度艺术水准的音乐”。是年由田汉介绍与张曙先后加入中国共产党。八月因病被联华辞退。
    一九三四年  二十三岁。为田汉作三幕剧《回春之曲》作曲，有《告别南洋》，《梅娘曲》，《春回来了》诸曲。四月一日进百代公司，协助任光做收音的工作，并学习和声学及对位法。十一月底向“百代”辞职，十二月做《大路歌》的配音工作。为电通公司出品田汉编剧应云卫导演袁牧之陈波儿主演的《风云儿女》主题歌作曲，即现在的中华人民共和国国歌《义勇军进行曲》。
    一九三五年  二十四岁。进联华二厂工作。四月，因左翼文艺工作者大批被捕，上海局势恶劣，同时也为了进一步学习，他计划先去日本，后到欧洲。四月十五日从上海动身，十八日到东京。在他完成了头一个三月计划，正要开始第二个三月计划的时候，竟因游泳不慎，被太平洋海波吞噬了。
    附注：这个年谱是根据现有的几种材料编写的，因限于时间未能多方征询，错误遗漏一定难免。他的作品很少写明创作年月，故亦未能完全列入年谱。希望知道他生平的同志加以补充和指正，以便日后编订详细的年谱。
