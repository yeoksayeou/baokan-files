Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 10th: A new phenomenon in Tianjin's publicly owned factories' production competition in June is the increasing number of rationalization proposals from workers. In the first half of the month, the various factories of the China Textile Company received nearly 100 suggestions from workers, of which 37 have been examined and approved. The Central Electrical Engineering Materials First Manufacturing Plant also received over 170 rationalization proposals in June. The emergence of this phenomenon is inseparable from the importance attached to these suggestions by several factories. Since June, many factories have successively established or improved rationalization proposal committees to specifically organize and lead this activity. Some factories have been able to review workers' suggestions in a timely manner; if adopted, in addition to public commendation, a certain amount of bonus is given based on the value created; for suggestions that cannot be adopted, the reasons must be explained to prevent the suggester's enthusiasm from waning. China Textile Company Factories No. 1 and No. 6 and the Railway Bureau have also announced topics based on the needs of their respective production units to solicit suggestions in order to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and solve the urgent problems that need to be solved at present. The content of the rationalization proposals put forward by workers includes technical improvements and creations, as well as savings aspects. Since the beginning of the May production competition, the Central Electrical Engineering Materials First Manufacturing Plant has adopted 49 suggestions from workers, creating a value equivalent to more than 157,000 jin of corn flour. Among them, Liu Qiying, an old technician from the Tram Company, created a gear milling machine, which increased work efficiency by six times. Ye Houshu, deputy engineer of the battery group, proposed changing the direction of machine rotation, which increased lead powder production from 700 kilograms in 24 hours to 1,130 kilograms, increasing efficiency by 60 percent. Liu Xuanhua, an engineer from China Textile Company, proposed improving the packaging method of gauze, which can save nearly 100,000 jin of corn flour per month. In Tianjin Steel Plant, Tianjin Railway Bureau Branch, Guye Locomotive Depot and other units, workers also put forward many suggestions on creating new tools and improving technical operation methods, which have proven to be completely effective after implementation.

　　工厂行政重视职工建议
    天津六月生产竞赛中合理化建议日渐增多
    【新华社天津十日电】六月份天津市公营工厂生产竞赛中的一个新现象是职工合理化建议日渐增多。中纺公司各厂上半月收到职工的建议近百件，已经审查成立了三十七件；中央电工器材第一制造厂六月份亦收到合理化建议一百七十余件。这种现象的产生是和若干工厂对这些建议的重视不可分的。六月以来，不少工厂相继成立或健全了合理化建议委员会，具体组织领导这一活动。若干工厂对职工的建议已能做到及时审查；如经采纳，除公布表扬外，并根据创造价值的大小，给以一定数目的奖金；对不能采用的建议，也要说明原因，使建议者情绪不致低落。中纺公司一、六厂和铁路局，并根据本单位生产中的需要，公布课题，征求建议，以集中群众智慧，解决当前急需解决的问题。职工提出的合理化建议的内容，包括技术的改进和创造以及节约等方面。中央电工器材第一制造厂从五月生产竞赛开始到最近，已采纳了职工的四十九件建议，创造价值折合玉米面十五万七千余斤。其中电车公司老技工刘奇英创造了铣牙轮机，使工作效率提高了六倍。电池组副工程师叶厚畬，提出了改变机器转动方向的建议后，使铅粉产量由二十四小时出七百公斤增至一千一百三十公斤，提高效率百分之六十。中纺公司工程师刘宣华提出改进纱布包装法后，每月可节省玉米面近十万斤。在天津制钢厂、天津路局分局、古冶机务段等单位中，职工们也提出了创造新工具、改善技术作业方法等方面的建议多件，经实施后证明完全有效。
