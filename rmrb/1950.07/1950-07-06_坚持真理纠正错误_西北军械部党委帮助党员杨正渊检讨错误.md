　　Adhering to Truth and Correcting Mistakes
    The Northwest Ordnance Department Party Committee Helps Party Member Yang Zhengyuan Review His Mistakes
    On May 29th, the Xi'an Mass Daily published a news story about Yang Zhengyuan (Communist Party member), the chief of the Ordnance Section of the Ordnance Department of the Logistics Department of the Northwest Military Region, losing 70 million yuan of public funds in March this year due to trusting private merchants when purchasing iron sheets. After starting work in Xi'an, Yang Zhengyuan forgot the Party's instruction of "no accepting or giving gifts." In his interactions with merchants, he lost his position and accepted gifts from the private Jianhua Hardware Store, including a leather suitcase, a pair of shoes, and a carton of cigarettes. After accepting the task of purchasing iron sheets, he neither proactively asked for instructions from his superiors nor discussed with the deputy chief of the section who should be sent to buy the iron sheets or whether the private merchant was reliable. In order to quickly complete the task, Yang Zhengyuan entrusted Jianhua Hardware Store to purchase on his behalf. The Ordnance Section could have consulted with the Northwest Office stationed in Tianjin for assistance in purchasing, or requested the department's cooperative to send someone to buy it. However, Yang Zhengyuan mistakenly believed that "private merchants have many connections and can complete the task on time" and arbitrarily entrusted the private merchant. He was also careless and negligent, thinking that "we have been dealing with them for a long time and are familiar with each other, they won't cheat the public," so he did not carefully supervise the purchase and only sent Li Jie, a veteran who had been reinstated not long ago and was morally corrupt, to accompany them. As a result, the merchant made exorbitant profits of 76.65 million yuan in addition to a handling fee of 5 million yuan.
    After this incident was exposed by the Mass Daily, Yang Zhengyuan not only did not humbly accept criticism and conduct a review, but also angrily told the newspaper that he could not accept the criticism, citing factual inaccuracies in individual details. He particularly disagreed with the point about "losing his position and accepting gifts from private merchants," saying that this was to take care of "personal relations" and subjectively thought that "I have been in the revolution for more than ten years, how can I lose my position?!" The CPC Ordnance Department Party Committee held an enlarged meeting on June 5th and 6th to review this matter. During the meeting, everyone pointed out that Yang Zhengyuan's advantage was that he was active and responsible in his work, and that his entrustment of private merchants to buy iron sheets this time was also to quickly complete the task. However, they also criticized his undemocratic leadership style, his irritable temperament, and his failure to consider everyone's opinions in his work, which made comrades keep their opinions to themselves and dare not express them publicly. They also criticized him for not respecting his superiors, and sometimes refusing to carry out matters approved by the leaders. Regarding the issue of purchasing iron sheets, everyone believed that the basic spirit of the newspaper's criticism was correct and unanimously criticized Yang Zhengyuan for ideological麻痹[paralysis], accepting gifts from merchants, and losing his position. However, Yang Zhengyuan was still not humble in reviewing his mistakes and even openly resisted others' criticism of him. In this situation, the Party Committee consistently adhered to the principle of "curing the sickness to save the patient." In order to clear up his thinking first, the meeting was temporarily adjourned. With everyone's help, Yang Zhengyuan re-read Comrade Xi Zhongxun's report against bureaucracy and commandism, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists." He repeatedly read the parts of the documents that were related to his own ideological problems. For example, in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," it says: "A person's personality, temperament, and attitude are determined by society. For example, hitting and scolding people at every turn—this kind of temper is a problem of ideological concepts and a reflection of the ideology of the privileged class… It is wrong to handle things arbitrarily according to one's subjective will, and that is subjectivism and a manifestation of a weak Party spirit." This passage inspired him to examine his own irritable personality, and he slowly realized that his "irritable personality" could not be explained by "innate disposition," and that his mistakes could not be justified by "the starting point was good," but should be measured by the losses to the country. The leading comrades also talked to him and induced him to recognize his mistakes. Yang Huchen, director of the Logistics Department's Xi'an Office, used his own experience and the detours he had taken in the process of ideological transformation to explain that a Communist Party member can only correct mistakes if they face them squarely, and only then can they make progress. He also helped him analyze his mistakes and pointed out that he should strictly overcome the serious shortcomings of individualism and a lack of humble learning in the future.
    After repeated enlightenment and guidance, and after intense ideological struggle, Yang Zhengyuan finally recognized his mistakes. At this time, the Party Committee convened another enlarged meeting. At the meeting, Yang Zhengyuan reviewed his mistakes and assured the Party that he would humbly accept criticism and opinions, obey leadership, stand firm, refuse to accept any gifts, and strive to learn and improve his political level, and move forward with everyone in the rectification movement. At the meeting, everyone believed that the leadership's bureaucracy in the department was also responsible for the occurrence of this error. At the same time, it was pointed out that Yang Zhengyuan's review was only the beginning of his progress and awakening, and that he should work hard to transform himself in his future practical work. The Ordnance Department Party Committee has now submitted this issue to the Logistics Department Party Committee for handling. Since Yang Zhengyuan has begun to recognize his mistakes, the Ordnance Department Party Committee also suggested lenient treatment in terms of organizational discipline.

　　坚持真理纠正错误
    西北军械部党委帮助党员杨正渊检讨错误
    五月二十九日，西安群众日报发表了西北军区后勤部所属军械部军械科长杨正渊（共产党员）在今年三月购买铁皮工作中，轻信私商，损失公款七千万元的新闻。杨正渊在进入西安工作后，忘记了党的“不准受礼和送礼”的指示，在与商人的交往中，丧失立场，接受私商建华五金商行所送的皮箱一只、鞋一双、纸烟一条等礼物。在接受了购买铁皮的工作后，既不主动的向领导同志请示，又未同该科副科长研究买铁皮该派谁去，及私商是否可靠等问题，为了迅速完成任务，杨正渊便委托建华五金商行代买。本来军械科可以商请驻天津的西北办事处协同代购，或请该部合作社派人去买的，但杨正渊却错误地认为：“私商关系多，能按时完成任务”，而擅自委托私商，并粗心麻痹，以为“来往时间长，彼此熟悉，他们不会亏公家”，以致在购买中又未认真监督，仅只派一生活腐化的复职不久的退伍军人李杰随行，致使该商行除手续费五百万元外，又从中牟取暴利七千六百五十万元。
    这一事件被群众日报揭发后，杨正渊非但不虚心接受批评进行检讨，反而借口个别枝节问题的失实，气愤地向报社表示不能接受批评。对于“丧失立场，接受私商礼物”一点尤不同意，他说这是照顾“人情”，并主观地以为“自己革命十多年了，还能失掉立场吗”？！中共军械部党委为此于六月五、六两日召开扩大会议进行检讨。会议中大家指出杨正渊同志的优点是工作积极负责，这次委托私商买铁皮，也是为了要迅速完成任务。但同时批评了他的领导作风不民主，性情暴躁，工作中不多考虑大家意见，使同志们有意见闷在心里，不敢公开提出；对领导则不尊重，领导人批准照办的事情，他有时竟然拒绝执行。关于购买铁皮问题，大家认为报纸的批评基本精神是正确的。并一致批评杨正渊思想麻痹，接受商人礼物，失掉立场。但杨正渊对自己的错误仍不虚心检讨，甚至公开对抗别人对他的批评。在此情况下，党委始终坚持治病救人的原则，为了先打通思想，暂告休会。杨正渊在大家的帮助下，重新阅读习仲勋同志的反对官僚主义和命令主义的报告，及刘少奇同志的论共产党员的修养。他将文件中与自己的思想毛病有关的地方，反复阅读，比方，在论共产党员的修养中说：“人的个性、脾气、态度是社会决定的。比如动辄就打人骂人——这种脾气，是一个思想观念的问题，是特权阶级的思想的反映。……凭着主观任意逞性去处理事情那是不对的，这就是主观主义，党性不强的表现。”这一段，就启发着他对自己的个性暴躁进行了检讨，慢慢地认识自己“个性暴躁”，不能用“生就的秉性”来解释了，对自己所犯的错误，也不能仅以“出发点是好的”来辩护了，而是要用国家的受损失的情形来衡量的。领导同志也对他进行谈话，诱导他认识自己的错误。后勤部西安办事处长杨虎臣以自己亲身经历及在思想改造过程中所走的弯路，说明一个共产党员只有正视错误，才能改正错误，才能使自己进步；并帮助他分析错误，指出今后应严格克服个人主义和不虚心学习的严重缺点。
    经过反复的启发诱导，经过了激烈的思想斗争，杨正渊终于认识了自己的错误。这时，党委再次召开扩大会议。会议上杨正渊检讨了自己的错误，并向党保证：虚心接受批评和意见，服从领导；站稳立场，拒绝接受任何礼物；努力学习，提高政治水平，在整风运动中和大家一起前进。会议上大家认为这一错误的产生，该部领导上的官僚主义也要负一定的责任。同时指出杨正渊的检讨仅是他进步和觉悟的开始，还应在今后的实际工作中努力改造自己。现军械部党委已将此问题提交后勤部党委处理。由于杨正渊已开始认识错误，军械部党委并建议在组织纪律上从宽处理。
