　　Mothers' Voices Against Aggression
　　By our reporter Péi Lán
　　News of American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and the Korean people's victorious anti-aggression war, have been arriving in rapid succession to the Haidian and Liulangzhuang areas in the western suburbs of Beijing. Upon hearing this, the working women and housewives were both indignant and excited.

　　Wèi Chí Liánzhēn, a woman in her fifties with seven children, three of whom participated in the revolution, became a cultural teacher at a civilian school in Haidian after Beijing's liberation. She said, "I want to tell my children that in order to thoroughly liberate Taiwan and support the Korean people's war of liberation, they must study and work hard. In the civilian school, I must also teach everyone culture and diligently study politics." Mother Zhù, a mother of three, said, "Chairman Mao has led the Chinese people in revolution for over twenty years. Today we have won, we have been liberated, and we have the strength to defend this victorious achievement. Although I cannot take up a gun and fight, my heart is determined to oppose American imperialism." The mothers all excitedly declared: It is not easy to raise a child, from wiping their bottoms, wiping their pee, feeding them milk... But, if American imperialism dares to invade us, we will send one young and strong lad after another to fight them to the death!

　　When the mothers recalled the scenes of American imperialism harming the Chinese people in Beijing, each one gnashed their teeth in hatred. Dǒng Shūhuá once personally witnessed American soldiers in a jeep on Zhushikou Avenue outside Qianmen, using an iron bar to smash a hole in the head of a fellow villager, causing blood to flow freely, and the villager to collapse on the ground, while the American soldiers laughed and drove away in their jeep. An old woman in her sixties was walking in Dongsi Pailou when many American soldiers in a jeep knocked her down and ran over her, exposing the bones of her thigh outside her bloodied skin. Recalling these blood debts, some of the mothers' eyes turned red, and the female village head Zhāng Shūmíng said with tears in her eyes: "If an American soldier is brought here, I want to ask him, if I give him seven US dollars to buy his life, will he do it?" It turned out that in Chánjiǎowān, near the Xijiao Airport, a nine-year-old child from the Cuī family was crushed to death by an American soldier's jeep. The unyielding Chinese people could no longer endure this humiliation and brought the case to court. As a result, the Kuomintang government, the running dog of American imperialism, ruled that its master only needed to pay seven US dollars to settle this case of murder. In addition to providing guns, cannons, and airplanes and having the Chinese fight for them, American imperialists were also bloodily murdering peaceful Chinese residents. Conscientious Chinese people will never forget these hatreds.

　　The mothers resolutely stated: American imperialism's atomic bomb cannot scare us. All Chinese and peace-loving mothers of the world must unite to oppose American aggression and see how many days of glory this paper tiger of American imperialism can have!

　　Why are these mothers so brave, loving their country, and loving all peace-loving people in the world? Dǒng Shūhuá and Dǒng Shūzhēn, young female laborers, said it well: "Our ancestors have toiled for the landlords for generations, and at the end of each year, they ended up with nothing. The Communist Party came, and Chairman Mao led us to stand up, divided the land and divided the houses. With difficulty, we looked forward to a good life, and if anyone doesn't let us live in peace, we will fight them to the death!" Wáng Shùnchéng's wife took out a letter she had written to her son for everyone to see. The letter read: "Chairman Mao led us to stand up. Last year, our village implemented land reform. Our family was allocated two houses, twelve mu of dry land, three mu and seven fen of paddy field, and also five hundred catties of rice and eight hundred catties of corn. Now our family has food and drink. I hope you study hard and make great contributions when liberating Taiwan, which will be the glory of your parents."

　　The mothers love their homes and love their leader, Chairman Mao. They are determined to work hard in production, educate their children, and cultivate new forces for the new China. The young and middle-aged women of Liulangzhuang, filled with confidence in supporting the liberation of Taiwan, said: "This year, the rice fields in our village are growing better than ever before. If the weather is favorable, we can guarantee an increase of one and a half percent in production, and in good cases, even two percent. For every extra stone of grain we harvest, we can make an extra artillery shell to completely eliminate the Chiang bandits, defeat American imperialism, and liberate Taiwan."

　　母亲们的反侵略呼声
    本报记者  培蓝
    美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜与朝鲜人民反侵略战争节节胜利的消息，接二连三的传到了北京西郊海甸、六郎庄一带。劳动妇女和家庭主妇们听到了，又是愤慨，又是兴奋。
    有七个孩子，三个孩子参加了革命的五十多岁的尉迟廉贞，在北京解放后，担任了海甸镇民校文化教员。她说：“我要告诉我的孩子们，为了彻底解放台湾和支援朝鲜人民解放战争，要努力学习和工作。我在民校，也更要一面教大家学文化，一面努力学习政治。”有三个孩子的母亲祝妈妈说：“毛主席领导中国人民革命了二十多年，今天我们胜利了，翻身了，我们有力量保卫这个胜利果实。我虽然不能拿枪打仗；反对美帝的心却是坚决的。”母亲们都激动地声言：我们抚养一个孩子，从擦屎、擦尿、喂奶……养大正是不容易，但是，如果美帝国主义胆敢侵略我们，我们就要送出一个个年青力壮的小伙子去和他们拚命！
    提起美帝在北京残害中国人民的情景时，母亲们个个咬牙切齿。董淑华曾经在前门外珠市口大街，亲眼看到吉普车上的美国兵，用铁棍在一个老乡头上打了一个窟窿，鲜血直流，老乡昏倒在地，美国兵却哈哈大笑开着吉普车走了。一位六十多岁的老太太，在东四牌楼走路，许多美国兵坐着吉普车，把老太太撞倒压过去，老太太大腿的骨头，露在血淋淋的皮外。想起这些血债，有的母亲的眼圈都红了，女闾长张淑明噙着眼泪说：“拉来一个美国兵，我要问问他，给他七块美金，买他一条人命，他干不干？”原来在西郊飞机场附近蝉角湾，一个崔家九岁的孩子，被美国兵的吉普车压死了，倔强的中国人，再不能忍受这个凌辱，告到了法院，结果美国帝国主义的走狗国民党政府判决，他的主子只要赔偿七块美金，就可以了却这一件人命案子。美国帝国主义者除了出枪、出炮、出飞机，让中国人给他打仗外，同时又鲜血淋淋的在杀害中国和平居民，有良心的中国人，永远不会忘记这些仇恨。
    母亲们坚毅地表示：美帝国主义的原子弹，吓不倒我们，全中国、全世界爱好和平的母亲们团结反对美国侵略，看美帝这只纸老虎，能有几天威风！
    这些母亲们为什么能这样勇敢，热爱自己的祖国，热爱全世界爱好和平的人们，董淑华、董淑贞女青年劳动者说得好：“我们祖祖辈辈，给地主扛长活，年年到头落个两手空。共产党来了，毛主席领导我们翻身了，分了土地分了房，好容易盼来了好光景，谁不让我们安心过好日子，我们就要和他拚！”王顺成的妻子，拿出给她儿子的信让大家看，信上写着：“毛主席领导咱们翻身了，去年咱村实行了土地改革，咱家分了两间房子、十二亩旱地、三亩七分水地，还分了五百斤大米、八百斤玉米。现在咱家有吃有喝了，希望你好好学习，解放台湾时立个大功，才是父母的光荣。”
    母亲们热爱自己的家园，热爱自己的领袖毛主席，她们决心努力生产，教育孩子，为新中国培养新生力量。六郎庄的青壮年妇女，对支援解放台湾，充满信心地说：“俺村今年稻田比每年长得都好，如果风雨调和，可保证增产一成半，好的还可增产两成。我们多打一石粮，就可多造一颗炮弹，彻底消灭蒋匪、打败美国帝国主义，解放台湾。”
