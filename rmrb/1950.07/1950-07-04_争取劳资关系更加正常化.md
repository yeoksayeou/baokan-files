　　Currently, labor-management relations in private enterprises across the country have basically become stable. This is a very favorable condition for production.

　　After liberation, labor-management relations in private enterprises across the country experienced two relatively large fluctuations. The first occurred in the short period after the major cities across the country were liberated, when workers mainly raised disputes such as resuming work and increasing wages. The second occurred after March of this year, from inflation to price stabilization, reaching a climax in April. The labor-management disputes during this period focused on collective dismissals and severance pay disputes. After these two relatively large fluctuations, labor and management gradually deepened their understanding of many common interests of both parties and the policies of the People's Government on labor issues. Governments at all levels have also gradually gained experience in resolving labor disputes.

　　In the current situation of our country, tense labor-management relations are very detrimental to production, and therefore detrimental to both labor and management. The truth about this has been fully proven over the past year, and both labor and management have a deep understanding of it. Reasonable adjustment of labor-management relations has become a common understanding of most people.

　　What is the most successful experience in adjusting labor-management relations?

　　From last year to now, in adjusting labor-management relations, two successful experiences have been widely adopted across the country: one is the signing of labor-management collective contracts, and the other is the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings.

　　The labor-management consultation meeting is where labor and management each send an equal number of representatives to resolve all issues related to the interests of both parties in private enterprises based on democratic principles and through equal consultation. At the labor-management consultation meeting, representatives of labor and management can deeply understand each other's difficulties and demands, and resolve various disputes in a timely and practical manner. This experience is being promoted throughout the country. According to statistics from existing materials in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Jinan, and other cities, 479 labor-management consultation meetings have been established. Among them, there are 134 industry or trade consultation meetings, and 345 factory and store consultation meetings. In the initial period, labor-management consultation meetings mostly solved disputes such as evacuation and dismissal. Now it has developed to solving active aspects such as improving management and maintaining production at cost. This is a big step forward. Facts have proved that in industries or enterprises where labor-management consultation meetings are well held, the enthusiasm of workers and capitalists has significantly increased. On the worker side, after consultation, most can work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, voluntarily reduce wages or work in shifts to maintain production, and actively help the capitalists overcome difficulties. On the other hand, the capitalists can also gradually change their business policies and management methods. Some capitalists have therefore changed their negative wait-and-see attitude and tried to increase capital, which has created favorable conditions for the maintenance and recovery of production. As a result of the joint consultation and efforts of labor and management, some very difficult private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been maintained. Some private factories have seen new production records since their establishment.

　　Where is the key to the success of labor-management consultation?

　　Labor-management consultation must be based on the policy of "developing production" and "mutual benefit for labor and management." Developing production is the common demand of both labor and management, and it also conforms to the fundamental interests of the people's country. Only by developing production can there be more jobs for workers, and can the living conditions of workers be gradually improved. Because only when "production grows by an inch" can "welfare grow by a fraction." Only by developing production can capitalists maintain their enterprises, and then be profitable, and then accumulate capital and expand their enterprises. However, to ensure that labor and management work together to develop production, the policy of mutual benefit for labor and management must be implemented, and not the policy of one-sided benefit. Originally, in private enterprises, workers were in an exploited position. In old China, capitalists oppressed workers, and workers resisted capitalists, and there was no talk of mutual benefit. In the new China, the People's Government has adopted a policy of protecting labor and adjusting industry and commerce, so there has emerged a possibility that although the capitalists still exploit the workers to a certain extent, they must respect the legal status of the workers, implement democratic management, guarantee certain labor conditions for the workers, and gradually improve them within the scope possible to improve the workers' enthusiasm for production; the workers must also respect the management rights of the capitalists, change their work attitude, work hard to produce, maintain and develop the enterprise, to improve the capitalists' confidence in management. The fact that labor-management consultation meetings in many industries have developed from solving general labor-management disputes to solving production problems is proof of the correctness of the above-mentioned policy.

　　However, the conduct of labor-management consultation meetings is not without difficulties. Both labor and management have had and still have some ideological concerns about labor-management consultation meetings. First of all, some capitalists continue to maintain the view of belittling workers, unwilling to solve problems with workers on an equal footing, and attempt to continue to manage enterprises by suppressing workers. Some capitalists are afraid that labor-management consultation meetings will infringe on their ownership or management rights of the enterprise, and therefore take a perfunctory attitude towards it. These ideas are wrong. After the victory of the people's revolution, the nature of our country has undergone fundamental changes, and the working class has become the leading class of the country; in private enterprises, although workers still have to endure a certain degree of exploitation, their political status has fundamentally changed, that is, from the status of slaves to the status of masters. The People's Government has promulgated and will continue to promulgate the necessary laws to protect labor, and any behavior that continues to oppress and enslave workers is not allowed by the laws of the People's Government. Capitalists should understand that any machine must be used by workers, and if the capitalists continue to suppress the workers, they will suppress the workers' enthusiasm and reduce the efficiency of the machine, which is also detrimental to the capitalists. The labor-management consultation meeting is a new form of democratic management implemented by the capitalists. It does not solve problems by the voting procedure of the minority obeying the majority, but reaches an agreement through democratic and equal consultation. Implementing this agreement agreed by the workers will not only not affect the capitalists' management rights, but will only increase the efficiency of the capitalists' exercise of management rights. Some workers also have some concerns about labor-management consultation meetings. They are afraid that the capitalists will raise too many difficulties at the meeting and worry that they will be reduced in salary or dismissed. There are also a few workers who want to force the capitalists to implement branch factories and stores, but are unwilling to implement labor-management consultation. These are also incorrect. In response to these phenomena, trade unions should deeply educate workers to recognize their new status, and as long as they conform to the conditions of mutual benefit for labor and management, they can and should play an active role in private enterprises. Workers should take the initiative to solve problems with the capitalists. When the capitalists do have difficulties, under certain conditions, workers should make appropriate concessions to maintain production. This concession is in line with the long-term interests of the working class.

　　Some people express great satisfaction with the achievements of the current labor-management consultation meeting, and believe that there will be no more labor-management disputes from now on. On the one hand, this indicates that labor-management consultation has indeed achieved results, and on the other hand, it also indicates that some people have unrealistic ideas about labor-management relations. Because, in private enterprises, since there is a contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, disputes may occur at any time, and ignoring or suppressing labor-management disputes is incorrect. The question is how to properly resolve labor-management disputes that have already occurred, and properly prevent labor-management disputes that may occur.

　　So, is the labor-management consultation meeting the only way to resolve or prevent labor-management disputes? Is the labor-management collective contract implemented last year no longer necessary? Of course not. When labor-management relations are relatively tense, labor-management consultation meetings can resolve labor-management disputes in a timely manner, but to further stabilize labor-management relations, it is also necessary to sign labor-management collective contracts. Because it is under the principle of voluntary labor-management, making labor-management relations a democratic, equal, mutually beneficial, and contractual relationship. The labor-management consultation meeting can become a preparatory step for the signing of a labor-management collective contract, and its agreement, after it takes effect, can become the basis for the signing of a labor-management collective contract. The reason why the adjustment of labor-management relations after March this year did not adopt the method of universally signing collective contracts is because under the tense economic situation in March and April this year, there was no possibility of signing collective contracts.

　　Now that the economic situation has stabilized, better conditions have been created for the signing of collective contracts. The labor-management collective contract is a further step in consolidating labor-management relations than labor-management consultation. It relatively fixedly stipulates the rights, responsibilities, and labor conditions of both labor and management. In this way, production can be carried out more peacefully, without having to constantly consult on these major issues. Too much consultation is precisely a reflection of unstable labor-management relations.

　　More fundamentally stabilizing labor-management relations depends on the state's issuance of various necessary labor laws. The workers' wages, working hours, labor insurance, factory hygiene facilities, and other items should be clearly stipulated by national laws, so that disputes will not occur frequently. However, this can only be implemented when the country's financial and economic situation has improved and the social economy has gradually gotten on the right track. At present, the relevant authorities are preparing such draft laws. Judging from the current situation, a new situation of stable production has begun to appear in private enterprises; continuing to promote and consolidate such a situation is what both labor and management should strive for.

### 争取劳资关系更加正常化

　　争取劳资关系更加正常化
    目前，全国私营企业中的劳资关系，基本上已趋于稳定。这是对生产很有利的条件。
    全国各地私营企业中的劳资关系，在解放以后，曾经经过两次比较大的波动。第一次是发生在全国各大城市刚被解放的短时期内，那时是以工人方面提出复工、增资等争议为主。第二次是发生在今年三月以后从通货膨胀到物价稳定过程中，在四月份达到了高潮。这时期的劳资纠纷，集中于集体解雇及遣散费的争执。劳资双方经过这两次比较大的波动，逐渐深入地了解了劳资双方的许多共同利害以及人民政府对于劳资问题的政策。各级人民政府在解决劳资纠纷方面，也逐渐获得了经验。
    在我们国家的目前状况下，劳资关系的紧张，对于生产是十分不利的，因而对于劳资双方也都是不利的。关于这个真理，一年来已经有了充分的证明，劳资双方对此都有了深刻的体验。劳资关系必须合理调整，已成为大多数人共同的认识了。
    调整劳资关系最成功的经验是什么呢？
    从去年到现在，在调整劳资关系中，全国各地普遍采用了两个成功的经验，一个是订立劳资集体合同，一个是建立劳资协商会议。
    劳资协商会议是由劳资双方派出同等数量的代表，根据民主原则，用平等协商的方法，解决私营企业中有关劳资双方利益的一切问题。在劳资协商会议上，劳资双方的代表可以深入地了解彼此的困难和要求，及时地合乎实际地解决各种争议问题。这种经验，全国各地正在推广。据上海、天津、北京、沈阳、武汉、广州、济南等城市现有材料统计，已成立劳资协商会议四百七十九个。其中产业或行业协商会议共一百三十四个，工厂商店协商会议共三百四十五个。最初一个时期，劳资协商会议多半是解决疏散、解雇等争议问题。现在已经发展到解决改善经营及保本生产等积极方面的问题了。这是一个很大的进步。事实证明：凡是劳资协商会议开得好的行业或企业，工人与资本家的积极性都显著地提高。工人方面，经过协商后，大半能努力增加生产，厉行节约，自愿减薪或轮班工作以维持生产，主动帮助资方克服困难。另外一方面，资方也能逐步改变经营方针和管理方法，有些资方因此改变了消极观望的态度，设法增加资本，这就为生产的维持与恢复，创造了有利条件。由于劳资双方共同协商努力的结果，使某些非常困难的有利于国计民生的私营企业得以维持下来。有些私营工厂中已出现了建厂以来的生产新纪录。
    劳资协商成功的关键在那里呢？
    劳资协商必须以“发展生产”和“劳资两利”的政策作基础。发展生产是劳资双方共同的要求，同时也符合于人民国家的根本利益。只有发展生产，才能有更多的工人就业，才可能逐步改善工人的生活条件。因为只有“生产长一寸”，才能“福利长一分”。也只有发展生产，资本家才能维持企业，进而有利可图，也才能积累资本，扩大企业。但是，要保证劳资双方协力发展生产，必须实行劳资两利的政策，而不能实行任何一方面的一利政策。本来在私营企业中，工人是处于被剥削的地位。在旧中国，资本家压迫工人，工人反抗资本家，根本谈不到什么两利。在新中国，人民政府采取了保护劳动与调整工商业的政策，因此，就出现了一种可能，即资方虽然一方面仍在一定程度上剥削劳方，但必须尊重劳方的法律地位，实行民主管理，保障劳方一定的劳动条件，并在可能范围内加以逐渐改善，以提高劳方的生产积极性；劳方同样要尊重资方的管理权，改变劳动态度，努力生产，维持并发展企业，以提高资方的经营信心。许多行业的劳资协商会议，已由解决一般的劳资争议问题，发展到解决生产问题，正说明上述方针的正确性。
    但是，劳资协商会议的进行，不是没有困难的。劳资双方对于劳资协商会议都曾经而且现在仍然有些思想顾虑。首先是有些资本家仍继续保持着轻视工人的观点，不愿和工人在平等地位上解决问题，企图依旧用压制工人的方法管理企业。有些资本家，害怕劳资协商会议会侵犯自己的企业所有权或管理权，因而对它采取敷衍的态度。这些思想是不对的。人民革命胜利后，我们国家的性质已经发生了根本的变化，工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级；在私营企业中，工人虽然还要忍受一定程度的剥削，但其政治地位，则已根本改变，即由奴隶的地位变为主人的地位了。人民政府已经颁布了并将继续颁布必要的保护劳动的法令，任何继续压迫、奴役工人的行为，都是人民政府的法律所不允许的。资本家应该懂得，任何机器都要由工人来使用，资方继续压制工人，就会压制工人的积极性，减低机器的效能，这对资本家也是不利的。劳资协商会议是资方实行民主管理的新形式，它并不以少数服从多数的表决程序解决问题，而以民主的平等协商达成协议。实行这种工人同意了的协议，不只不会影响资方的经营权，只会增加资方行使经营权的效率。有些工人对于劳资协商会议，也有一些顾虑。他们害怕资方在会上提出过多的困难，耽心自己会被减薪或者解雇。还有少数工人想压迫资方实行分厂分店，而不愿实行劳资协商，这些也都是不正确的。针对着这些现象，工会应该深入地教育工人认识自己的新的地位，只要符合于劳资两利的条件，就可以而且应当在私营企业中发挥积极的作用。工人应当主动地和资方解决问题。在资方确有困难时，在一定的条件下，工人应作适当的让步，以维持生产。这种让步是符合于工人阶级的长远利益的。
    有些人对目前的劳资协商会议的成绩，表示十分满意，并且认为从此可以不再发生劳资争议。这一方面表示劳资协商确有成绩，另一方面也表示有些人在劳资关系上有不合实际的思想。因为，在私营企业中，既然存在着工人阶级与资产阶级的矛盾，就随时可能发生争议，忽视或压制劳资争议都是不正确的。问题在于如何适当地解决已经发生了的劳资争议，和妥善地防止可能发生的劳资争议。
    那么，是不是劳资协商会议就是解决或预防劳资争议的唯一方法呢？是不是去年实行过的劳资集体合同已经不必要了呢？当然不是的。在劳资关系比较紧张的时候，劳资协商会议可以及时地解决劳资争议，但是，要进一步稳定劳资关系，还必须订立劳资集体合同。因为它是在劳资双方自愿的原则下，使劳资关系成为一种民主的、平等的、两利的、契约的关系。劳资协商会议正可以成为订立劳资集体合同的准备步骤，它的协议，在施行有效之后，可以成为订立劳资集体合同的基础。今年三月以后，调整劳资关系之所以没有采取普遍订立集体合同的办法的方式，是因为今年三、四月间紧张的经济情况下，没有签订集体合同的可能性。
    现在经济情况已趋于稳定，已经造成了订立集体合同的更好的条件。劳资集体合同比劳资协商，在巩固劳资关系上是更进一步的形式，它比较固定地规定着劳资双方的权利、责任和劳动条件，这样，就可以更安心地进行生产，不必经常地在这些主要问题上进行协商。太多的协商，正是劳资关系不稳定的反映。
    更根本地稳定劳资关系，有待于国家颁发各种必要的劳动法令。工人的工资、工时和劳动保险、工厂卫生设施等项，均应由国家法律明文规定，那就不会经常发生争议了。但是，这是要在国家财政经济状况已经好转，社会经济逐渐走上正轨的时候，才可能实行。现在各有关机关，已在准备这样的法令草案。就目前情形看来，在私营企业中，一种安定生产的新局面已开始出现；继续推进和巩固这样的局面，便是劳资双方所应当努力的。
