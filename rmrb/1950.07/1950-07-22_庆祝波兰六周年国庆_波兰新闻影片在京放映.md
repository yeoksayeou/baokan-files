　　Celebrating the 6th Anniversary of Polish National Day
    Polish Newsreels Screened in Beijing
    [Our Newspaper] Today (July 22nd) is the 6th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic. To express our warm congratulations, the North China Film Management Company of the Central Film Bureau has specially selected four Polish newsreels to be screened before the main feature at the "Capital," "Dahua," "New China," and "Changong" cinemas in the city starting today. These four newsreels are the first films of the Polish people to be shown publicly in China. From these short films, we can see that in people's Poland, labor is a glorious thing. Thanks to rationalization proposals and the production increase movement, many heroic figures have emerged. Furthermore, we can understand the lives, work, and entertainment of the Polish working people; there are no unemployed people in the country, and life is very stable. This shows that people's Poland is approaching an even brighter future day by day.
    The four short films are: (1) "New Polish Architecture" specifically introduces Warsaw, the capital of Poland, which suffered severe damage during the war. The working people are rebuilding it with the highest enthusiasm, creating many heroic deeds. (This film is being shown at the "New China" cinema.)
    (2) "New Polish Pastures" explains how the Polish government, in order to promote the development of the pasture economy, allocated 3,000 hectares of good pastureland at the foot of the mountains to mountain residents, changing the old habit of mountain people driving sheep to the mountains every spring, thereby improving the milk quality and wool production of the sheep. (This film is being shown at the "Dahua" cinema.)
    (3) "Polish Farmers' Children's School" A "National Opera and Dance School" was founded in an old manor in Karolin near Warsaw, specializing in cultivating the children of farmers. This is the realization of the farmers' wish for many years under the leadership of the People's Polish government. (This film is being shown at the "Changong" cinema.)
    (4) "Miner's Letter" uses the form of a letter written by a coal miner, Polak, to Stanislaw, to illustrate how the working class in people's Poland is using their enthusiastic working spirit, creativity, and initiative to change the old coal mining methods. After various tests and overcoming many difficulties, Polak's rationalization proposal was finally implemented in the mine, increasing coal production and guaranteeing industrial production. (This film is being shown at the "Capital" cinema.)
