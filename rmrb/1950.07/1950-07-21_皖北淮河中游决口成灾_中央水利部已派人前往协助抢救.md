　　Breach in the Middle Reaches of the Huai River in Northern Anhui Causes Disaster
    Central Ministry of Water Resources Dispatches Personnel to Assist in Rescue Efforts
    [Report from this newspaper] Water Resources Ministry, Wang Lei reports: The north and south embankments of the middle reaches of the Huai River in the Northern Anhui Administrative Region breached on the 6th of this month at Sanhejian and other locations on the border of Henan and Anhui provinces. According to a report from the Fuyang Special District, approximately 6 million mu of cultivated land in the special district has been completely submerged, and 7 million mu have been partially submerged, resulting in a very serious disaster situation.
    Since the end of June, the Huai River basin has experienced widespread heavy rainfall. As of July 16th, Zhengyangguan had received a total rainfall of 499 mm, and Bengbu had received 548 mm from June 20th to July 17th. The dikes of the southern tributaries of the Huai River, including the Gu River, Run River, Hei River, Ni River, and Hong River, and the northern and central Fei River and Ci River, have all been overflowing, resulting in widespread flooding. The floodwaters have also inundated the urban areas of Fuyang, Linquan, Taihe, and Yingshang counties in the Fuyang Special District. On the 6th of this month, at 3:00 PM, the southern embankment of the Huai River breached in the Renwang section of the Yin Jieliu and Ying Jieliu in the territory of Huoqiu County, Lu'an Special District. On the same day, the northern embankment also completely collapsed in the Sanhejian to Wang Jieliu section belonging to Fuyang Special District. In Funan County, in the six districts and 150 townships along the Huai River, the water depth reached over ten feet on flat ground, with houses and electric poles in 24 of these townships completely submerged, and over 10,000 houses collapsed. Because of the sudden rise in floodwaters and the abrupt breach of the embankment, the masses did not have time to escape, and climbed onto rooftops and treetops, resulting in the drowning of over 70 people.
    In addition, due to the overflowing of the Sui River and Hongze Lake, the Sihong, Lingbao, and Wuhe counties in the Suxian Special District and the electric poles in the region were completely destroyed by the flood, disrupting transportation. In the Linhuai Pass, Gaoqiu Lake, Huangtanyao, and Sujiagang sections of the Chuxian Special District, a total of 50,000 mu of land was flooded.
    In recent days, the flood level of the Huai River has continued to rise. On the 18th, the water level at Zhengyangguan had reached 24.74 meters, exceeding the highest flood level in 1931 (24.05 meters) by 0.69 meters. On the same day, the water level at Bengbu reached 20.22 meters, exceeding the highest flood level in 1931 by 1.01 meters. On the 11th, 70% of the area of Zhengyangguan Street was flooded, and residents have begun to move.
    After the disaster occurred, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office immediately issued instructions, urgently mobilizing the military and civilians throughout the region to carry out flood prevention and rescue operations. Zheng Baozhen, the deputy director of the Administrative Office, has already led five steamships from Bengbu, towing a large number of civilian boats, carrying 10 million jin of relief grain, rushing to the severely affected areas such as the Fuyang Special District for rescue. In addition to allocating 20 million jin of relief grain to the disaster areas in Northern Anhui, the East China Military and Political Committee has also organized an inspection team led by Liu Chongguang and Wang Huzhen, two deputy ministers of the East China Water Resources Department, to rush to the disaster areas. The East China Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on the 12th, ordering flood control commands at all levels in Northern Anhui to carry out emergency rescue operations, and to strictly prevent the continued creation of other new disasters.
    [Another Dispatch] After the Huai River rose and caused a disaster in the Fuyang Special District of Northern Anhui, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, in addition to instructing the East China Water Resources Department and the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau to send personnel to inspect and take emergency measures, also dispatched Xu Kai, director of the Planning Committee and director of the Planning Department, on July 18th, along with three hydraulic engineers and assistant engineers, and one administrative cadre, to the Huai River basin for an on-site investigation, in order to thoroughly understand the situation, analyze the water situation and find out the rules, as a reference for fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, and at the same time assist the East China region in flood prevention, rescue and other work.

　　皖北淮河中游决口成灾
    中央水利部已派人前往协助抢救
    【本报讯】水利部王雷报导：皖北行政区淮河中游南北堤，于本月六日在豫皖交界处三河尖等地决口。据阜阳专区报告：该专区耕地全部被淹没的约六百万亩，部分被淹没的七百万亩，灾情甚为严重。
    淮河流域自六月底以来，普遍大雨。截至七月十六日止，正阳关共降雨四九九公厘，蚌埠自六月二十日至七月十七日降雨五四八公厘。淮河支流南部谷河、润河、黑河、泥河、洪河，北部及中部肥河、茨河等河河堤均被漫溢，遍地汪洋，洪水并灌入阜阳专区的阜阳，临泉、太和、颍上等县城厢。本月六日下午三时，淮河南堤在六安专区霍邱县境内任王段的殷截溜，迎截溜等处破堤。同日，北堤也在阜阳专所属的三河尖至王截溜段，全部溃决。阜南县沿淮河六个区一百五十个乡，平地水深一丈多，其中二十四个乡房屋、电杆全部被水淹没，倒塌房屋一万多间。因为洪水陡涨，突然破堤，群众未及逃避，攀登屋顶、树梢，淹死七十余人。
    此外，宿县专区和滁县专区因睢河、洪泽湖等洪水漫溢，宿县专区的泗洪、灵宝、五和等县境内，电杆全部被水冲毁，交通中断。滁县专区临淮关的高邱湖和黄滩窑，苏家岗段，共淹地五万亩。
    近日来，淮河洪水位仍继续上涨。十八日正阳关水位已达二四·七四公尺，超过一九三一年最高洪水位（二四·○五公尺）○·六九公尺。同日蚌埠水位达二○·二二公尺，超过一九三一年最高洪水位一·○一公尺。十一日正阳关街上即有百分之七十的地区浸水，居民已开始搬家。
    灾情发生后，皖北行署即发出指示，紧急动员全区军民进行防汛抢险。行署副主任郑抱真已从蚌埠率领轮船五艘，并拖带大批民船，载运救济粮一千万斤，赶往阜阳专区等重灾地区进行抢救。华东军政委会除先后拨给皖北灾区二千万斤救济粮外，亦组织视察团由华东水利部两副部长刘宠光、汪胡祯率领，赶赴灾区。华东防汛指挥部于十二日发出指示，令皖北各级防汛指挥进行紧急抢救，并严密防范继续造成其他新灾。
    【又讯】皖北阜阳专区因淮河上涨而成灾后，中央人民政府水利部除指示华东水利部、淮河水利工程总局派员检查并采取紧急措施外，又于七月十八日派计划委员会主任兼规划司司长须恺，偕水利工程师、副工程师三人、行政干部一人，专赴淮河流域进行实地查勘，以彻底了解情况，并分析水情找出规律，作根本治淮之参考，同时协助华东区进行防汛抢险等工作。
