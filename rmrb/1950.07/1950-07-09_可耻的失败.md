　　Shameful Defeat
    Ma Fantuo
    The swindler puts away his smile,
    The robber reveals his true form,
    Yesterday he said "no interference in other countries' internal affairs,"
    Today he invades the Korean people!
　
    In the past, this robber didn't show his face,
    In China, Greece, the Philippines... he used others as his knife;
    Now he takes off his mask and personally takes the field,
    Revealing his ferocious and evil true form.
　
    Sending supplies, transporting munitions, dispatching military advisors,
    Using planes, using cannons, mobilizing the navy, army, and air force,
    And ordering those accomplices of Britain and Australia
    To slaughter the peaceful people of a distant country together!
　
    Korea is in the Eastern Hemisphere, you—America—are in the Western Hemisphere,
    The Pacific Ocean separates your countries on two sides,
    You attack Korea, you bomb Korea,
    Just because this distant country affects your "security"?
　
    The robber reveals his true form,
    Hitler returns from the grave:
    Truman, Dulles, Johnson... MacArthur
    —Shave off the small mustache, put on black glasses.
　
    But the heroic Korean soldiers
    Shattered the invaders' dreams—
    "Pyeongyang can be occupied in three days,"
    The "unfortunate" fact is that Seoul was lost on the fourth day!
　
    It is you—Dulles,
    Who recently crawled into the trenches of the "38th parallel,"
    Looking at the map, peering through binoculars, nodding your head,
    Today you tuck your tail between your legs and run away!
　
    It is you—MacArthur,
    Who recently took a plane to the front to bomb,
    Today you issued a hypocritical scream:
    "Humanity, humanity, be humane to the captured American soldiers..."
　
    It is you—you, this large group of
    Military advisors directing the burning and killing of women, children, and civilians,
    You abandoned your vehicles and swam to escape,
    Running with your tails between your legs, even losing your luggage.
　
    It is you—Truman, Acheson...
    You thought you could swallow Korea in one gulp,
    Today you wake up and realize things are not good,
    The front and rear headquarters are both in chaos,
　
    Some canceled their weekend vacations,
    Some left the golf course,
    Some were still wearing banquet attire,
    Some didn't have time to take off their beachwear.
　
    This bunch of things gathered in the White House den for a meeting,
    Afraid to see reporters, slipped out the back door one by one.
    The Associated Press said the climate at the front is unfavorable to the American army;
    The United Press said the defeated soldiers at the front are like a race.
　
    Defeat! Defeat! Shameful defeat!
    The warmongers, in front of the people of the world,
    Announced their bloody crimes,
    Announced the bankruptcy of imperialism!

　　可耻的失败
    马凡陀
    骗子放下笑脸，
    强盗露出原形，
    昨天刚说“不干涉他国内政”，
    今天就进攻朝鲜人民！
　
    过去这强盗还不抛头露面，
    在中国、希腊、菲律宾……他借刀杀人；
    如今他脱下面具，亲自出马，
    露出那副穷凶极恶的原形。
　
    送物资，运军火，派遣军事顾问，
    用飞机，用大炮，动员海陆空军，
    还命令英国、澳洲那些帮凶
    一齐去屠杀一个遥远国家的和平人民！
　
    朝鲜在东半球，你——美国在西半球，
    太平洋把你们国土隔开两边，
    你进攻朝鲜，你轰炸朝鲜，
    就为这遥远的国家影响你的“安全”？
　
    强盗露出原形，
    希特勒借尸回魂：
    杜鲁门、杜勒斯、詹逊……麦克阿瑟
    ——剃去小胡子，戴上黑眼镜。
　
    但是英勇的朝鲜战士们
    打破了侵略者的迷梦——
    “三天内能把平壤占领，”
    “不幸”的事实是第四天丢了汉城！
　
    就是你——杜勒斯，
    前不久爬进“三八线”的战壕，
    看地图，打望远镜，点头摆脑，
    今天夹起尾巴溜跑！
　
    就是你——麦克阿瑟，
    前不久坐飞机，前线去轰炸，
    今天发出了假惺惺的尖叫：
    “人道，人道，对被俘美军要人道……”
　
    就是你们——你们这一大批
    指挥烧杀妇孺平民的军事顾问，
    你们抛下了车子，泅水而逃，
    屁滚尿流，连行李也丢掉。
　
    就是你们——杜鲁门、艾奇逊……
    你们满以为一口可以把朝鲜吞下，
    今天醒来，大事不好，
    前方和后方司令部都乱成一团糟，
　
    有的打消了周末休假，
    有的离开了高尔夫球场，
    有的还穿着宴会的礼服，
    有的来不及脱下海滨的便装。
　
    聚集在白宫盗窟里开会的这批东西，
    不敢见记者，一个个从后门溜掉。
    美联社说，前线气候不利于美军；
    合众社说，前线败兵好像赛跑。
　
    失败！失败！可耻的失败！
    战争贩子们在全世界人民面前，
    宣布了血腥的罪状，
    宣布了帝国主义的破产！
