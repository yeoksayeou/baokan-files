    [This Newspaper's News] According to Xinhua News Agency reports, the first Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School in the Northwest region opened last month in Xi'an, with a study period of three years. Among the more than one hundred and sixty students, industrial workers account for fifty percent, cadres account for thirty-six percent, and soldiers account for fourteen percent. Because the students have all participated in practical work, while the teachers lack practical struggle experience, the school has decided to adopt a learning method of teachers and students learning together and teaching each other, in order to achieve the goal of teaching and learning from each other.

　　西安工农速成中学开学
    【本报讯】据新华社消息，西北区第一所工农速成中学已于上月在西安开学，学习时间为三年。在一百六十余名学员中，产业工人占百分之五十，干部占百分之三十六，战士占百分之十四。因为学员均参加过实际工作，教员则缺乏实际斗争经验，该校决定采取师生共学、互教互学的学习方法，以达到教学相长的目的。
