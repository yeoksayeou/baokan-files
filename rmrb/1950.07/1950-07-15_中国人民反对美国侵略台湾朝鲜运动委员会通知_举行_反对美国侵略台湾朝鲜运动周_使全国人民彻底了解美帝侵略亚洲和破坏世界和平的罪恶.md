　　Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea has issued the following notice to mobilize the whole country to launch "Anti-American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea Movement Week":

　　(1) The shameless crimes of American imperialism in directly attacking the Korean people, invading our country's territory of Taiwan, and interfering in the liberation struggles of the Vietnamese and Filipino peoples have aroused the anger and widespread opposition of the people of the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions has called on the working class of the world to support the Korean people's war of liberation and to hold "Support Korean People's Week" starting from the 10th of this month. We, the Chinese people, should resolutely support the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions. In order to combine our movement against American aggression in Taiwan and support for the Korean people's war of liberation, and to ensure that this movement is well-prepared in terms of propaganda, we call on all parts of the country to launch "Anti-American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea Movement Week" starting from July 17th (in areas where preparations are insufficient, it can be changed to starting from July 23rd).

　　(2) The main purpose of this movement is to conduct in-depth propaganda and education among the people of the whole country, so that the people of the whole country thoroughly understand the crimes of American imperialism in aggressing against the Asian people and undermining world peace, and thoroughly understand that American imperialism is not only not terrifying, but also completely defeatable. It is necessary to explain to the people of the whole country that: (1) We resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism against China's territory of Taiwan Province. The Chinese people, who have already defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism, have the full strength to liberate their own territory of Taiwan, drive out the American aggressors, and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gangs. We must work hard to make all preparations for the liberation of Taiwan, and during the Movement Week, expose the rumors spread by American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents about the Taiwan and Korean issues, and step up the work of suppressing secret agents and bandits. (2) The armed intervention of American imperialism in Korea is a direct act of aggression against the Korean people. The resolution against the Korean people passed by the United Nations Security Council under the manipulation of the United States is completely illegal. The Syngman Rhee puppet government in South Korea is a running dog of American imperialism, and this war was provoked by Syngman Rhee under the instructions of the United States, just as the nationwide civil war that began in July 1946 in China was provoked by Chiang Kai-shek under the instructions of the United States. The war waged by the Korean people against American imperialism and its running dogs is a just war to win their own national liberation and unification. Assisting the Korean people's war of liberation to achieve final victory is the most effective way to defend world peace and combat the imperialist war plan at present. We, the Chinese people, should sympathize with and assist the Korean people's war of liberation. (3) The Korean people's war of liberation will surely achieve final victory. American imperialism is a paper tiger. The development of the Korean war in the past half month has proved that American imperialism is very fragile. Although the United States has mobilized a large number of its naval and air forces and tens of thousands of its land forces in the Far East, and mobilized the naval and air forces of many of its servant countries, it still cannot stop the victorious advance of the Korean People's Army. Thousands of American soldiers have been killed, wounded, or captured. Entire battalions of American infantry and tank units have been outflanked, surrounded, and annihilated. Dozens of American planes have been shot down. American imperialism has been very panicked by its failure in Korea and is now preparing to continue to increase troops and expand its aggression against Korea. However, the result of American imperialism's expansion of aggression will only be to sink deeper and deeper and suffer a more tragic defeat. (4) Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, and other oppressed nations in Asia are now also launching great struggles against American and other imperialist aggression. The anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian people cannot be suppressed and will surely be victorious. China is one of the main countries in Asia and has close relations with Asian countries. The Chinese people should understand and care about the struggles of the Asian people. All the people of Asia should unite in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with one heart and one mind, defeat imperialist aggression and the conspiracy of a new world war.

　　(3) In order to hold the Movement Week, sufficient propaganda personnel and propaganda materials should be prepared. The work items of the Movement Week can be decided by various localities according to their specific circumstances: (1) Mobilize manpower in all aspects, and use various forms such as newspapers, magazines, radio, wall newspapers, paintings, dramas, movies, songs, exhibitions, and speeches to do powerful propaganda, and widely post victory reports of the Korean People's Army and maps of the Korean war situation. (2) Factories, schools, organs, troops, and rural areas can hold meetings separately. Major cities can hold mass meetings or representative mass meetings. (3) Mobilize students and young people to carry out street propaganda and rural propaganda. (4) Mobilize urban housewives to gather in districts for propaganda. (5) The urban industrial and commercial circles should participate in propaganda work, and appropriate propaganda materials can be posted at the entrances of various shops.

　　(4) The work of this Movement Week should be combined with the signature campaign to defend world peace, and propaganda should be carried out with reference to the "Propaganda Points for the Signature Campaign for the Declaration to Defend World Peace" issued by the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace.

　　(5) People's organizations in major cities should immediately discuss the establishment of local committees against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea to be responsible for leading the Movement Week and related work thereafter. In places where there is no need to establish branches, the main local people's organizations can be responsible for leading the work of this Movement Week.

　　(6) This committee was established in Beijing on the 10th, and the temporary office is located in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Please inform us of the progress of the Movement Week in various places at any time.

　　中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会通知
    举行“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”
    使全国人民彻底了解美帝侵略亚洲和破坏世界和平的罪恶
    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会为号召全国各地举行“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”，特发出通知如下：
    （一）美国帝国主义直接进攻朝鲜人民、侵略我国领土台湾、干涉越南和菲律宾人民解放斗争的无耻罪行，已引起全世界人民的愤怒和普遍的反对。世界工会联合会号召全世界工人阶级支援朝鲜人民解放战争，自本月十日起举行“支援朝鲜人民周”。我们中国人民应当坚决拥护世界工会联合会的号召。为了使我们反对美国侵略台湾和支援朝鲜人民解放战争的运动结合起来，为了使这一运动在宣传工作上有充分的准备，我们号召全国各地自七月十七日起（在筹备不及的地方可改为自七月二十三日起）举行“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”。
    （二）这一运动的主要目的，就是对全国人民进行深入的宣传教育，使全国人民彻底了解美国帝国主义侵略亚洲人民和破坏世界和平的罪恶，彻底了解美国帝国主义不但不可怕，而且是完全可以战胜的。必须向全国人民说明：（１）我们坚决反对美国帝国主义对中国领土台湾省的侵略。已经战胜日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派的中国人民，完全有力量去解放自己的领土台湾，驱逐美国侵略者，彻底消灭蒋介石残余匪帮。我们要努力地为解放台湾进行一切准备工作，并在运动周中揭露美蒋特务分子关于台湾朝鲜问题所散布的谣言，加紧扑灭特务土匪的工作。（２）美国帝国主义对朝鲜的武装干涉，是对于朝鲜人民的直接侵略行为。联合国安全理事会在美国操纵下所通过的反对朝鲜人民的决议是完全非法的。南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府是美国帝国主义的走狗，这次战争就是李承晚在美国指使下挑动起来的，正如同一九四六年七月所开始的中国全国性内战是蒋介石在美国指使下挑动起来的一样。朝鲜人民所进行的反对美国帝国主义及其走狗的战争，是争取自己民族解放和统一的正义战争。援助朝鲜人民解放战争获得最后胜利，是目前保卫世界和平和打击帝国主义战争计划的一个最有效的方法。我们中国人民应当同情和援助朝鲜人民的解放战争。（３）朝鲜人民解放战争一定会取得最后的胜利。美国帝国主义是纸老虎。半个多月来朝鲜战事的发展，证明了美国帝国主义十分脆弱。美国虽然动员了它在远东的大量海空军和几万陆军，并且动员了它的许多仆从国家的海空军，却仍然不能阻止朝鲜人民军的胜利前进。几千个美国士兵被打死、打伤或俘虏了。整营的美国步兵和坦克部队被迂回包围和歼灭了。几十架美国飞机被击落了。美国帝国主义已因自己在朝鲜的失败而十分慌张，现正准备继续增兵扩大对朝鲜的侵略。但是，美国帝国主义扩大侵略的结果，只会是愈陷愈深，和受到更悲惨的失败。（４）越南、菲律宾、日本和亚洲其他被压迫民族，现在也都在展开反对美国和其他帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争。亚洲人民的反帝国主义斗争是不能够压迫下去的，是一定会胜利的。中国是亚洲的主要国家之一，和亚洲各国有密切关系，中国人民应当了解和关心亚洲人民的斗争。全亚洲人民应当团结在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中间，万众一心，击败帝国主义的侵略和新世界战争阴谋。
    （三）为了举行运动周，应当准备充分的宣传人员和宣传品。运动周的工作项目，各地可根据当地的具体情况决定：（１）动员各方面的人力，通过报纸、杂志、广播、壁报、绘画、戏剧、电影、歌曲、展览、演讲等各种形式，来做有力的宣传，并广泛地张贴朝鲜人民军胜利战报及朝鲜战争形势图。（２）各工厂、学校、机关、部队、农村可分别举行大会。各大城市可举行市民大会或有代表性的群众大会。（３）动员学生青年进行街头宣传和农村宣传。（４）动员城市家庭妇女分区集会宣传。（５）城市工商界应参加宣传工作，在各商店门口可贴置适当的宣传品。
    （四）这一运动周的工作应与保卫世界和平签名运动相结合，并参照中国保卫世界和平大会委员会所发的“保卫世界和平宣言签名运动周宣传要点”进行宣传。
    （五）各大城市人民团体应立即商议建立各地的反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会，负责领导运动周及其以后的有关工作。在无建立分会必要的地方，可由当地主要人民团体负责领导进行这一运动周的工作。
    （六）本会已于十日在北京成立，临时办公处设在中华全国总工会。各地进行运动周工作的情形望随时告知。
                      中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会
                                              七月十四日
