　　Large Quantities of Moldy Peanuts Neglected

    Urgent Request for Prompt Inspection and Handling by the Handan Commissioner's Office

    In April of this year, a batch of large peanut seeds from the Handan Special District was transported by train to Tianjin. When the train arrived at Jin County Station, a fire was accidentally started by the person escorting the train. The fire was extinguished by the masses. One train car was burned, dozens of burlap sacks were lost, and some peanuts were damaged. The remaining peanuts, totaling about ten thousand jin, were stored in the yard of a coal yard belonging to the Jin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Since being stored in the coal yard, they have only been covered with a few reed mats and have remained there for over two months. Due to continuous rain, the peanuts have become moldy. According to people at the Jin County Station, someone from the Handan Special District had come, but they did not find a way to transport the peanuts away or store them in a suitable place. This irresponsible attitude towards state property should be immediately investigated and corrected by the Handan Commissioner's Office to prevent undue losses to state assets.

　　大批花生发霉无人管
    望邯郸专署迅速检查处理
    今年四月，邯郸专区由火车运往天津大花生种一批，车到晋县站时，因押车人不慎着火，后经群众将火扑灭。计烧毁车皮一辆，损失了几十条麻包袋及一部分花生；剩下的即存在晋县供销社的一个煤栈的院子里，数目约有万余斤。这批花生存放在煤栈以后，上边只盖了几领席子，至今已有两个多月了。由于阴雨连绵，花生都已发了霉。据晋县车站的人说：邯郸专区曾来过人，但并未想办法运走，或者保存到妥善的地方去。这种对国家资财不负责任的态度，应请邯郸专署立即调查纠正，以免国家资财受到不应有的损失。
