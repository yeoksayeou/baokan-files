Beijing Post Office Develops Newspaper Subscription Base
　　Exceeds Target Last Month
　　[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Postal Administration exceeded its task of distributing this newspaper in June. The bureau originally planned to increase circulation in Beijing by 2,500 copies in June (from June 7 to July 7), but actually completed 6,213 copies. The best performance was by the distribution section and the newspaper delivery staff, who completed a total of 2,134 copies. Yan Shoushan of the Eleventh Branch alone completed 96 copies.
　　Among the more than 6,000 subscribers, government agencies and organizations accounted for 28 percent, businesses accounted for 20 percent, workers accounted for 15 percent, schools accounted for 8 percent, factories accounted for 7 percent, and others accounted for 22 percent. Among all subscribers, those subscribing for one month or more accounted for 53 percent, those subscribing for more than half a month but less than one month accounted for 17 percent, and those subscribing for less than half a month accounted for 30 percent.
　　The reasons why the bureau exceeded its target are as follows:
　　1. Internal mobilization was widespread and thorough. All employees were basically mobilized. All units, whether leaders, workers, or staff, worked hard for this task. After work, the office staff also went to develop subscriptions. On the other hand, extensive external publicity was also carried out. Some bureaus posted advertisements at the entrance or organized publicity groups to carry out publicity. Some postmen put publicity flags on their bicycles. The management bureau posted publicity advertisements on the cars transporting mail, broadcast on the radio, and showed advertisements in movie theaters. These publicity efforts have all achieved good results. Because the vast majority of employees recognized that newspaper distribution is a political task of the post office, some people worked day and night in the movement. In the past, colleagues greeted each other with polite conversation, but now they are mutually concerned about the newspaper distribution situation.
　　2. Planning was meticulous and specific. The management bureau had an overall plan, and each unit also had a specific plan; within a unit, workers and staff all had plans. In this way, the entire work plan was implemented from top to bottom. Everyone had a clear direction for struggle, ensuring the completion of the task.
　　3. The leadership's attention and the close cooperation of the Party, government, and labor union. The management bureau used express reports to promptly report the numbers completed by each unit and introduced experiences. Each unit also used blackboards, meetings, and other methods to report the completion of employees and commend models, so that employees maintained high work enthusiasm.
　　The close combination of the Party, government, and labor union has always been an important factor in ensuring the successful completion of this work.
　　Several lessons learned from the June distribution work are: First, as long as we actively carry out distribution work and pay attention to publicity and mobilization work, we will surely achieve results. When the bureau determined the task of developing 2,500 copies in June, some people lacked confidence. But after a month of hard work, their confidence was established. Second, the work of distributing newspapers has improved the relationship between the post office and the masses. In the past, many businesses and citizens only knew that the post office delivered letters. Through newspaper distribution publicity work, they learned about other businesses of the post office. Third, it once again proved the truth that "relying on the masses and implementing democracy is the key to doing a good job." Each unit formulated plans through representative meetings and group meetings, introduced experiences, overcame various difficulties, and completed the task.
　　The deviations in the distribution work in the past month were: individual branches or individual employees once believed that this was an "extra burden." Some emphasized incorrect ideas such as evenly distributing tasks. After the leadership pointed out the corrections, they were quickly overcome. Some also held a purely task-oriented view, resulting in the phenomenon of forcing subscriptions when developing subscribers, causing dissatisfaction among some newspaper vendors. There were also individual personnel who did not strictly implement the preferential treatment system. For example, a 10% discount was given even for subscribing to one newspaper, or ordinary subscribers were turned into reading groups.
　　The future work direction of the bureau is: First, continue to vigorously carry out distribution work. The leaders of each bureau should continuously educate and inspect employees, treat distribution work the same as letters and packages, so that distribution work can be carried out very well. Second, consolidate old subscribers and develop new subscribers. Third, grasp policies, do not compete for, or take subscribers from newspaper vendors, and unite newspaper vendors and newspaper boys. Fourth, evaluate merits and award prizes. The June blitz month has already drafted award methods, and a representative meeting will be held soon to discuss and evaluate and conduct awards. In the future, we will re-formulate reward methods for developing new subscribers and consolidating old subscribers to continue to carry out this work.

### 京邮局发展本报订阅户  上月超额完成任务

　　京邮局发展本报订阅户
    上月超额完成任务
    【本报讯】北京邮政管理局六月份超额完成发行本报任务。该局原计划六月份（自六月七日至七月七日）在京市增加发行二千五百份，实际完成六千二百一十三份。成绩最好的是发行科及各送报员，共完成二千一百三十四份。十一支局阎守山一人就完成了九十六份。
    上述六千余订阅户中，机关、团体占百分之二十八，商号占百分之二十，工人占百分之十五，学校占百分之八，工厂占百分之七，其他占百分之二十二。全部订阅户中，订阅时间一个月及一个月以上者占百分之五十三，半个月以上不足一个月者占百分之十七，不足半月者占百分之三十。
    该局超额完成任务的原因如下：
    一、内部动员普遍深入。全体职工基本上动员起来了。各单位不论是负责人、工人或职员，都为这一工作而努力。内勤人员下班后也去发展订阅户。另一方面，对外也进行了广泛的宣传。有的局在门口张贴广告，或组织宣传小组，进行宣传，有的邮递员在自行车上插上宣传小旗，管理局则在运邮件的汽车上张贴宣传广告，在电台上广播，在电影院放映广告等。这些宣传工作都收到良好效果。由于绝大部分职工认识了报纸发行工作是邮局的政治任务，因此在运动中，有人竟废寝忘食地工作。过去同事之间见面是一套寒暄，现在则是相互关怀着报纸发行的情况。
    二、计划周密具体。在管理局方面有总的计划，各单位也有具体计划；在一个单位中，工人、职员都有计划，这样便把整个工作计划自上而下地贯彻下来。大家有了明确的奋斗方向，保证了任务的完成。
    三、领导方面的重视，及党、政、工的密切配合。管理局利用快报及时报道了各单位完成的数字，并介绍了经验。各单位也分别利用黑板报、会议等方式，报道员工的完成情况，表扬模范，使员工保持了高涨的工作热情。
    党、政、工的始终密切结合，更是保证这一工作胜利完成的重要因素。
    六月份发行工作的几点体会是：一、只要主动地开展发行工作，并注意宣传动员工作，一定会收到成绩。当该局确定六月份发展二千五百份的任务时，有个别人员缺乏信心。但经过一个月的努力，他们的信心是建立起来了。二、发行报纸工作，改进了邮局与群众的关系。过去很多商号和市民只知道邮局送信。通过报纸发行宣传工作，使他们了解了邮局的其他业务。三、再度证明了“依靠群众，实行民主，是作好工作的关键”的真理。各单位通过代表会、小组会，订出计划，介绍经验，克服了种种困难，完成了任务。
    一月来发行工作的偏差是：个别支局或个别职工曾认为这是“额外负担”。有的则强调平均分配任务等不正确的想法。后经领导上指出纠正，即很快克服了。也有的抱着单纯任务观点，以致在发展订阅户时，发生顶报户的现象，引起部分报贩的不满。还有个别人员不严格执行优待制度。如订一份报也九折优待，或把普通订户变成读报小组。
    该局今后的工作方向是：一、继续大力开展发行工作，各局领导上应不断地向员工进行教育和检查，把发行工作和信函包裹一样看待，使发行工作很好地开展起来。二、巩固旧订户，发展新订户。三、掌握政策，不争夺，不顶报贩的订户，团结报贩、报童。四、评功评奖。六月份突击月已拟定了奖励办法，最近即可召开代表会议，讨论评定，进行奖励。今后将重新拟订发展新订户、巩固旧订户的奖励办法，以继续开展这一工作。
