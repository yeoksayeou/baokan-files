Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 2nd—The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial organizational work conference from June 1st to 20th to discuss and deploy a rectification movement for rural work cadres throughout the province, in preparation for implementing land reform after the autumn harvest. The conference summarized the work of the past year, pointing out that over the past year, it had systematically trained more than 25,000 cadres from the ranks of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and had reformed the township and village governments in more than 90% of the regions. The conference believes that there are still serious undesirable work styles such as bureaucracy and commandism among the vast number of rural work cadres, and that many grassroots government organizations and peasant associations also have impure elements. These have weakened the connection between the Party and the People's Government and the broad masses. To this end, the conference decided to conduct a general rectification movement among rural work cadres in Hubei Province, in accordance with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on rectification. In addition to coordinating with regular work, the rectification work will begin in July, and Party representative conferences, cadre conferences, and short-term training courses will be held from top to bottom throughout the province. Combining the summary of work, a large-scale rectification study movement will be carried out for half a month to a month to enable rural work cadres to understand various policies and correct various undesirable work styles. For grassroots organizations such as peasant associations, township, and village governments, education will be strengthened according to different situations, democratic life systems will be established, bad elements will be purged, and democratic elections will be gradually and universally implemented.

　　中共湖北省委召开全省组织工作会议
    布置农村干部整风运动  准备秋后实行土地改革
    【新华社汉口二日电】中共湖北省委会于六月一日至二十日召开全省组织工作会议，讨论和布置全省农村工作干部的整风运动，准备秋后实行土地改革。会议总结了一年来的工作，指出：一年来曾有计划的培养了两万五千余名工、农及知识分子干部，并在百分之九十以上地区改造了乡、村政权。会议认为：在广大农村工作干部中，尚存在着严重的官僚主义、命令主义等不良的作风，很多基层政权机构和农民协会等组织亦有不纯现象，这些都削弱了党与人民政府和广大群众的联系。为此，会议决定：根据中共中央整风的指示，在湖北省农村工作干部中普遍进行整风。该项整风工作，除配合经常工作进行外，并自七月份开始，在全省范围内自上而下的分别召开党代表会、干部大会、短期训练班等，结合总结工作，进行半个月至一个月的大规模的整风学习运动，使农村工作干部了解各种政策，纠正各种不良作风。对农民协会、乡、村政权等基层组织，则分别情况，加强教育，建立民主生活制度，清洗坏分子，逐渐达到普遍的实行民主选举。
