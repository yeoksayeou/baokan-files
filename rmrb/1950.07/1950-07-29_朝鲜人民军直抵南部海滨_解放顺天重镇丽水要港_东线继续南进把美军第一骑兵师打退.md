Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: Pyongyang Radio broadcast: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced in a war report on the evening of July 27th that the People's Army troops are continuing to advance on all fronts.

On July 26th, the People's Army troops advancing in Jeolla Namdo liberated Suncheon, an important town in the province and a key defense point of the enemy. On the same day, the People's Army liberated Yeosu, an important port at the southern tip of the province. In the battles to liberate Suncheon and Yeosu, People's Army troops captured many enemy soldiers and seized a large number of spoils.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: TASS, New York, July 27th: Recent newspaper reports from Korea and Tokyo report that the Korean People's Army is advancing further towards Busan.

According to a report from Korea by Associated Press reporter Whitehead, the North Korean army is continuing to exert pressure on the right wing of the US troops retreating from Yeongdong, and at the same time launching new night raids on the left wing of the US troops, "making the US 1st Cavalry Division unable to stand firm," forcing the US troops to withdraw from some strongholds where they originally planned to establish a new defense line, thereby "causing the United States to revise its defense plans."

The New York Times Tokyo correspondent pointed out: The retreating American troops abandoned a large amount of equipment and supplies. "The Americans said they were bombarded by American cannons captured by the North Koreans a few hours ago."

    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：平壤电台广播：朝鲜人民军总司令部二十七日晚间发表的战报称：人民军部队正在继续全线推进。
    七月二十六日，在全罗南道前进的人民军部队，解放了该道的重镇、敌军的重要防御据点顺天。同日，人民军解放了该道南端的重要港口丽水。在解放顺天和丽水的战役中，人民军部队俘掳敌军多人，并缴获大批战利品。
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：朝鲜和东京最近的报纸消息报道朝鲜人民军又向釜山推进。
    据美联社记者怀特亥自朝鲜报道，北朝鲜军一方面继续对自永同撤退的美军的右翼施以压力，另一方面对美军的左翼开始新的夜间突袭，“打得美国第一骑兵师站不住脚”，迫使美军退出他们原来打算在那里建立新防御线的一些据点，从而“使美国修改其防御计划”。
    纽约时报东京记者指出：撤退的美国部队抛弃了大量的装备和供应品。“美国人说他们遭到北朝鲜数小时前所缴获的美国的大炮轰击”。
