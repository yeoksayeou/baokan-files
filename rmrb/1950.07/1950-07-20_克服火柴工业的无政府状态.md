　　Overcoming the Anarchy of the Match Industry
    According to the resolutions of the National Match Industry Conference in June, various regions are rationally adjusting the production and sales relationships of the match industry. This is a good phenomenon, a good phenomenon of transforming the anarchy in industrial production in old China to a more planned production.
    The blindness of the match industry in old China was astonishing. There were 312 match factories across the country, with over 1,200 match-making machines, and a maximum monthly production capacity of over 150,000 cases. The current production volume is about 77,000 cases, while the actual national consumption is only about 50,000 cases per month. This means that the current national consumption of matches is only one-third of the production capacity. The current production volume is only one-half of the production equipment capacity. The current production volume is also more than one-third in surplus. If blind production continues like this, it will inevitably aggravate the unsalable products, make the capital turnover more difficult, and even lead to more factory closures and worker unemployment.
    The National Match Industry Conference, through joint consultations between representatives of public and private match factories, decided to temporarily, proactively, and plannedly reduce production to over 48,000 cases per month in the second half of 1950, and prohibit the production of low-quality matches. In this way, on the one hand, the phenomenon of overproduction can be stopped, and on the other hand, the inventory can be gradually sold to activate the capital of each factory and improve the people's consumption. This step is reasonable, and therefore necessary. However, here, appropriate arrangements should be made between the public and private sectors, and between regions, to take into account the overall situation and avoid the tendency to overemphasize local interests. Private factories should organize joint ventures as much as possible to avoid blind competition and reduce man-made chaos. Appropriate arrangements should be made for the lives of workers when production is reduced. All factories that reduce production should hold practical labor-management consultations to ensure that both labor and management get what they deserve.
    The match industry still has a promising future. Its sales, like other industries, are mainly in rural areas. After the completion of the national land reform, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the convenience of national transportation, the match industry will have a new development. In fact, in many rural areas, there are still many people who do not have matches or cannot afford matches. "Striking stones to make fire" is not an isolated phenomenon in many rural areas. In other words, serving the farmers is the only way for the match industry to have a bright future.
    In order to open up current sales and welcome the future development situation, the match industry should make concrete efforts to improve quality and reduce costs.

### 克服火柴工业的无政府状态

　　克服火柴工业的无政府状态
    根据六月全国火柴工业会议的决议，各地正在合理地调整火柴工业的产销关系。这是一个好现象，是旧中国工业生产中的无政府状态，转变到比较有计划的生产的一个好现象。
    旧中国火柴工业的盲目性是惊人的。全国共有火柴工厂三百一十二家，排杆机一千二百余部，每月最大生产能力可达十五万余箱。现在生产量共约为七万七千余箱，而目前全国实际的消耗量每月仅约为五万余箱。这就是说，全国火柴目前消耗量仅为生产能力的三分之一。现在的生产量只及生产设备二分之一。现在的生产量亦过剩三分之一强。如果继续这样盲目生产下去，必然会加重产品滞销，资金周转将更加困难，以至于发生更多工厂停闭与工人失业的现象。
    全国火柴工业会议，在公私火柴厂代表共同协商之下，决定暂时地、主动地、有计划地减产，在一九五○年下半年减为每月四万八千余箱，并禁制低级火柴。这样，一方面可以停止生产过剩现象，另一方面可以逐步推销存货，以活动各厂的资金，并改善人民的消费。这种步骤是合理的，因此，也是必要的。不过，这里对于公私之间，地区之间，均应有适当的安排，要能统筹兼顾，要避免过分计较局部的利益的倾向。各私营工厂应尽可能组织联营，避免盲目地竞争，减少人为的混乱现象。减产时对于工人生活应有适当的安排。所有减产的工厂，均应当切实地举行劳资协商，使劳资双方各得其所。
    火柴工业是仍有发展前途的。它的销路与其他工业一样，主要在农村。在全国土地改革完成，农民生活改善，全国交通便利之后，火柴工业将有一个新的发展。事实上，在各地农村中，还有许多没有火柴或者买不起火柴的现象。“击石取火”，在许多地方的农村中并不是个别的现象。换一句话说，为农民服务，火柴工业才有远大的前途。
    为了开辟现在的销路，迎接将来发展的局面，火柴工业应当在提高质量、减低成本方面作切实的努力。
