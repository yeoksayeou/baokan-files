    Municipal Ninth Middle School
    To be Converted into a Technical School
    The Municipal Ninth Middle School in Chengzizhen, Mentougou, in order to suit the needs of the local environment, is planned to be converted into a technical school. Departments such as mining, metallurgy, and electrical engineering will be set up, preparing to develop in the direction of a higher industrial school. Therefore, the school will only enroll 150 freshmen in the first year of junior high school this year. The registration dates are from July 9th to 13th, and the examination date is July 14th. The school has preferential regulations to take care of the enrollment of workers' children. It is reported that the school plans to establish a branch school near Shijingshan in the 19th district, and is currently actively preparing for it. (Mu Dong)

    在门头沟城子镇的市立九中，为适合当地环境需要，拟改制为技术学校，将分设采矿、冶金、电机等科，准备向高级工业学校方向发展，故该校本年度招收新生只限初一一百五十名，报名日期为七月九日至十三日，考试日期为七月十四日，该校为照顾工人子弟入学，订有优待条例。闻该校计划于十九区石景山附近成立分校，目前正在积极筹备中。（慕东）
