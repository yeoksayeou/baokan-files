Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department Directs All Regions to Launch a Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign During the Hoe-Hanging Period

[Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: Summer hoeing work in the southern Manchuria region of Northeast China has basically ended; hoe-hanging in northern Manchuria will also take place in the latter half of this month. The hoe-hanging period is the central season for fertilizer accumulation of the year. For this reason, the Northeast People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department specifically instructed all subordinate regions on July 14th to deeply launch a mass fertilizer accumulation campaign during the hoe-hanging period. The instructions pointed out: In general areas, accumulating fertilizer and composting manure should be clearly identified as the central task during the hoe-hanging period; in flood control areas, in addition to grasping flood control, fertilizer accumulation should also be listed as one of the central tasks. First, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education to overcome certain conservative ideas among the masses. Through various district and village meetings, explain that the important link to restore and increase soil fertility and increase unit yield at present lies in conscientiously doing a good job in fertilizer accumulation and application. Strengthen specific technical guidance, improve fertilizer accumulation methods, all district and village cadres should first learn general fertilizer accumulation knowledge, summarize the fertilizer accumulation experience of the masses, and personally teach farmers to achieve the requirements of "accumulating more and composting well." Local agricultural experiment stations and demonstration farms should focus on setting a good example of fertilizer accumulation and manure production in nearby villages for demonstration. And seize this central season of fertilizer accumulation to conduct in-depth publicity and education and specific technical guidance. The instructions finally stated: The quality of fertilizer accumulation work during the hoe-hanging period will directly affect agricultural production next year, so all regions must ensure that this work is done well.

　　东北农林部指示各地
    挂锄期间开展积肥运动
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北南满地区夏锄工作已经基本结束；北满在本月下旬也将挂锄。挂锄期间正是一年积肥的中心季节。为此，东北人民政府农林部，特在七月十四日指示所属各地，在挂锄期间深入开展群众积肥运动。该指示指出：一般地区应明确地以积肥沤粪为挂锄期间的中心任务；在防汛区除应抓紧防汛外，亦应将积肥列为中心工作之一。首先应深入进行宣传教育，克服群众中某些保守思想，通过区村各种会议，说明目前恢复和增进地力提高单位产量的重要环节，在于认真搞好积肥施肥。加强具体技术指导，改进积肥方法，所有区村干部都应该首先学会一般积肥常识，总结群众积肥经验，并亲自动手教给农民，达到“积的多，沤的好”的要求。各地农事试验场、示范农场，应该在附近村有重点地作积肥造粪的好样子，以资示范。并抓紧这一积肥中心季节，进行深入的宣传教育与具体技术指导工作。该指示最后称：挂锄期间积肥工作做得好坏，将会直接影响到明年的农业生产，因此各地必须保证把这一工作做好。
