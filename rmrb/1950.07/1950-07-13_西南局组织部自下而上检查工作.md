    Southwest Bureau Organization Department Conducts Self-to-Top Work Inspection
    [From our dispatch] The rectification study of the Organization Department of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China continues, and the inspection of the leadership aspect has come to an end. On the 20th, Jiang Zhen, Deputy Minister of the department, delivered a preliminary inspection report on the work of the past six months at a meeting of all cadres. After the meeting, each group began to deliberate. From the 21st to the 23rd, a meeting of all cadres was convened to inspect the leadership's ideology and work style. Because the leading cadres repeatedly expressed the need to promote democracy and mobilized everyone to conduct inspections from the bottom up, speeches at the meeting were enthusiastic and the mood was warm and normal. Judging from the results of this inspection, the Organization Department, in a situation of unfamiliarity, lack of proficiency, heavy tasks, and shortage of cadres, has achieved considerable success due to the correct leadership of the Southwest Bureau and the hard work of all cadres: assigning cadres to the entire region and giving some instructions on organizational policies; establishing a system of organ work, gradually becoming familiar with the situation, becoming familiar with the business, gaining some work experience, and generally improving the ideological level and work ability of cadres. However, there are also some serious shortcomings and mistakes. For example, in view of the lack of cadres in the Southwest New District, cadres were not cautiously and boldly cultivated and used; in leadership work, there was a lack of in-depth study of the Central Committee's instructions; and even a few cadres had never studied these instructions at all. In terms of working methods, the central task of each period was not clear, and there was a lack of a scientific work system in the office. Through this inspection, both the leadership and the general comrades have a relatively clear understanding of the problems existing in the work. The department is continuing to conduct personal self-criticism and is studying specific methods for improving the work.

    西南局组织部自下而上检查工作
    【本报讯】中共中央西南局组织部整风学习继续进行，对领导方面的检查已告一段落。二十日该部江震副部长在全体干部会议上作了关于半年工作初步检查报告，会后各组即进行酝酿。二十一日至二十三日，召集全体干部会议对领导思想作风进行了检查。由于领导干部一再表示发扬民主，动员大家由下而上进行检查，所以会上发言踊跃，情绪热烈而正常。从这次检查结果来看，组织部在情况生疏、业务不熟、任务繁重、干部缺少的情况下，由于西南局的正确领导，和全体干部的艰苦努力，工作已获得不小的成绩：为全区配备干部，并作了一些组织政策的指示；建立起机关工作制度，逐渐熟悉情况，熟悉业务，取得一些工作经验，干部思想水平、工作能力一般都提高了一步。但也还存在一些严重缺点和错误。比如没有根据西南新区干部缺乏的情况下，慎重而放手地培养使用干部；在领导工作中，对中央指示缺乏深入研究；甚至有少数干部根本未研究过这些指示。在工作方法上，则每个时期的中心任务不明确，在机关里则缺乏科学的工作制度等。经过这次检查，领导方面和一般同志对工作中存在的问题都比较明确了。该部正继续进行个人检讨，并研究改进工作的具体办法。
