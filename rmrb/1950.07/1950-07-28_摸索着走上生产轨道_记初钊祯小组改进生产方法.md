　　Groping Towards the Production Track
    ——On the Chu Zhaozhen Group's Improvement of Production Methods
    By Our Correspondent Lan Cun
    The hardcover group of the binding section of Xinhua Printing Factory, under the leadership of the trade union group leader Chu Zhaozhen, has explored some methods to improve the work of the group, which has led to great progress in the Red May competition. The overall work efficiency of the group has increased by 50% compared to before the competition, exceeding the plan by 25%, and some rationalization proposals have been put forward.

    In the past, the hardcover group, like other production units in the factory, lacked unity among workers – the old workers in the new district had skills but were quite conservative; the new workers from the old liberated areas had poor skills but better political awareness. Workers from the new and old areas looked down on each other, and production was also poor.

    After Chu Zhaozhen returned from studying at the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Workers' School last November, he wholeheartedly wanted to improve the work of his group. He started by strengthening unity within the group. At that time, the old workers were very dissatisfied with the new worker Jing Xiangyao, saying that he had good theory and high cultural level, but he did not help everyone; he would report workers' shortcomings or mistakes to the leadership. Therefore, Lao Chu first talked to Jing Xiangyao, reflected everyone's opinions to him, and advised him to help everyone and learn technology from the old workers. Then, Lao Chu talked to the old technician Zhang Xiangru, and brought Zhang Xiangru and Jing Xiangyao together to talk, advising them not to quarrel, but to learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and lead everyone to improve the group's production. Jing Xiangyao accepted his opinion, took the initiative to unite the old workers, and learned technology. With the help of Lao Chu, some old workers also realized the importance of cultivating young workers and gradually changed their conservative ideas. The whole group gradually united. On this basis, the group adopted the following methods to improve the work.

    (1) Setting up group plans and individual plans. At the beginning of the competition, Lao Chu discussed with You Yannong, taking saving man-hours as the center, and based on past production experience, carefully calculated how much labor was required for each production process, and formulated the group's production plan. After setting the group plan, a meeting was convened with all the workers in the group, calling on the workers to set individual production plans. Because everyone had never made a plan before, there was great resistance in their minds. They all said, "It's better for everyone to work hard, why make a plan?!" For this reason, Lao Chu led several more meetings. He first made a plan himself for everyone to refer to; and helped others to make plans. As a result, everyone made plans according to their past highest production records.

    After individuals made plans and had clear goals, production quickly showed results. When binding the Communist Manifesto, the original plan was to complete 1,500 copies a day, but as a result, four people completed 2,100 copies a day. Using a hand-cranked machine to back-glue was originally planned for one person to do 60 copies per hour, but Zhang Weixin exceeded the plan and did 100 copies. And the quality of the products was guaranteed. After seeing the production achievements, everyone was inspired with higher production enthusiasm, and the production efficiency of each process was improved.

    (2) Establishing a system of mutual supervision and inspection. After completing the first task, the whole group held a review meeting. Hua Jinxiang himself reviewed that the glue brushing work was not good enough, and further proposed to establish a system of mutual supervision and mutual inspection in the various interconnected production links. For example, the glue brushers urged the label stickers to be fast, and the label stickers checked the quality of the glue brushing, etc. If it was found that a certain link was slow or the quality was not good, improvements were proposed immediately. As a result of doing so, the product quality of each link was improved when completing the second production task. For example, in the past, for every 10,000 books completed, six or seven inspectors had to check whether the glue brushing met the specifications, but now it is no longer necessary.

    (3) Actively trying to shorten man-hours and eliminate waste of labor. In order to reduce costs, the Chu Zhaozhen group adopted the following methods: First, launch a competition between fast hands and fast hands. The leather pasting originally could only paste 150 sheets per hour, but as a result of the competition, it was increased to 300 sheets per hour. Second, whoever has a little improvement in working methods is praised on the blackboard newspaper to encourage everyone to put forward rationalization proposals. When binding the Communist Party Constitution, production group leader You Yannong changed from using thread to saddle stitching, reducing every 10,000 books from 32 workers to 19 workers. Third, a joint contract was proposed to the folding group, preparing to eliminate inspectors. Because the number of pages or codes folded by the folding group is sometimes incorrect, the binding requires more than ten inspectors for every 10,000 books. Unfortunately, because the administration did not pay enough attention to this, although the contract was signed after repeated urging from the hardcover group, it was not handed over to the folding group for implementation.

    The work methods for improving production that the Chu Zhaozhen group groped out were never discovered by the factory's leadership during the competition. Therefore, they did not receive due encouragement and assistance; and even less were they able to promote their experience to other units.

　　摸索着走上生产轨道
    ——记初钊祯小组改进生产方法
    本报记者  蓝村
    新华印刷厂装订股的精装组，在工会小组长初钊祯的领导下，摸索到改进小组工作的一些办法，使该组在红五月竞赛当中，有了很大进步，全组的工作效率，比竞赛前提高了百分之五十，超过计划百分之二十五。并想出了一些合理化建议。
    过去，精装组和该厂其他生产单位一样，工友之间互不团结——新区的老工友有技术，但是相当保守；来自老区的新工友，技术差而政治认识较好。新、老区工友互相瞧不起；生产也搞不好。
    去年十一月，初钊祯在市总工会职工学校学习回来以后，就一心想把本组的工作搞好。他首先从加强组内的团结入手。当时老工友们对新工友荆相尧很不满意，说他理论好、文化高，但并不帮助大家；工人有缺点或错误，他就向领导上汇报。于是，老初就先找荆相尧谈，将大家的意见向他反映，劝他帮助大家，并向老工友学习技术。接着，老初又找老技工张相如谈，并把张相如和荆相尧找在一起谈心，劝他们不要闹意见，应互相学习，取长补短，带动大家，把组的生产搞好。荆相尧接受了他的意见，主动地去团结老工友，并学习技术。一些老工友们在老初的帮助下，也认识到培养青年工人的重要性，渐渐改变了保守观念。全组慢慢地团结了。在这个基础上，该组采取了以下的办法改进了工作。
    （一）订小组计划与个人计划。竞赛开始时，老初和由砚农商量，以节省工时为中心，根据过去的生产经验，仔细计算每一生产过程需要多少工，制订了全组的生产计划。订出小组计划以后，就召集全组工友在一起开会，号召工人们订个人生产计划。因为大家都没订过计划，思想上抵抗很大。都说：“大家抓紧时间干活好了，订计划干吗！？”为此，老初又领导着开了几次会。他自己先订出计划来，让大家参考；并帮助别人订。结果，大家都按照自己过去生产的最高纪录订了计划。
    个人订出计划，有了明确的奋斗目标，在生产上很快便收到了效果。装订共产党宣言时，原计划一天完成一千五百本，结果四个人一天就完成了二千一百本，用手摇机打背原订一人每小时打六十本，张维新就超过计划打到一百本。并且都保证了产品的质量。大家看到了生产成绩后，激起了更高的生产热情，每个过程的生产效率都提高了。
    （二）建立互相督促检查的制度。在完成第一个任务之后，全组开了个检讨会。滑金相自己检讨出刷胶的工作不够好，并进一步提出在各个互相联系的生产环节中，建立起互相督促互相检查的制度。比如刷胶的督促粘条子的快，粘条子的检查刷胶的质量等等。如发觉那个环节工作慢了或质量不好，当即提出改进。这样做的结果，在完成第二个生产任务时，各个环节的产品质量都提高了，如过去每完成一万册书，须有六、七个检查工检查刷胶是否合规格，现在则可不用了。
    （三）积极设法缩短工时，消灭浪费工。为了减低成本，初钊祯小组采用了以下的办法：第一，发动快手和快手比赛。糊皮子的原来每小时只能糊一百五十张，比赛结果，提高到每小时糊三百张。第二，谁对工作方法有了一点改进就在黑板报上表扬，鼓励大家提出合理化建议。生产组长由砚农在装订共产党党章时，由用线索改为用骑钉订，每一万本书由三十二个工减少到十九个工。第三，向折页组提出订联系合同，准备消灭检查工。因为折页的有时折页数目或码子不对，装订时每万本书要费十多个检查工。可惜因为行政方面对此不够重视，经精装组多次催促，合同虽签订了，却未交折页组实行。
    初钊祯小组摸索到了这些改进生产的工作方法，在竞赛中始终没有被该厂的领导上发现。因此，也没得到应有的鼓励和帮助；更没有能够把他们的经验向其他单位推广。
