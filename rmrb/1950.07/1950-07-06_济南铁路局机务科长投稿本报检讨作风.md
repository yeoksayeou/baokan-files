Jinan Railway Bureau Locomotive Department Chief Submits Self-Criticism to the Newspaper for Work Style

[This Newspaper] Jinan Railway Bureau Locomotive Department's Locomotive Section Chief Xu Tiecheng specifically submitted a self-criticism to this newspaper, confessing his error of underestimating the "Locomotive Major Inspection Work" and his careless work style, and expressing his determination to earnestly correct them. The submitted article stated that, because he underestimated the locomotive major inspection work and failed to conduct in-depth and thorough inspections of locomotives entering the factory, he caused a serious train derailment accident; and prolonged the repair time of several locomotives, preventing them from leaving the factory on time, which partially affected the completion of factory tasks and caused huge losses to the country.

Two months ago, the Jinan Railway Bureau issued instructions to carry out a comprehensive major inspection of locomotives, but he thought that "the main materials for repairs have not yet been resolved, and locomotive inspection work can be delayed," and failed to attach importance to locomotive inspection. Due to the sloppy inspection work by the Yanzhou Locomotive Depot, a scrapped bad water tank axle was installed on locomotive ワろ1一九四五, which resulted in the locomotive cutting its axle between Jingting and Lincheng on June 2nd, causing a serious train derailment accident. Since April, the Jinan Locomotive Depot has had three locomotives that entered the factory for repair have had their repair schedules changed. For example, the ゑT6一五三六 locomotive, which entered the factory on June 6th, was described in the repair request as requiring a medium repair. After a second inspection, it was discovered that the top of the locomotive's boiler was in some places as thin as three millimeters, reaching a dangerous level, and the repair schedule had to be changed. There were similar situations with four other locomotives from Hefei, Xuzhou, and other depots. This disrupted the factory's production plan and caused some locomotives to be delayed in leaving the factory. At this time, instead of making a good self-criticism of the Locomotive Department's insufficient locomotive maintenance and use, he complained that the factory repairs were not good and the support was insufficient. This led to ideological conflicts between individual comrades in the Locomotive and Factory departments, directly affecting the work. Xu Tiecheng concluded in his self-criticism: "We must never neglect this locomotive major inspection work again. We must conduct meticulous and thorough inspections of locomotives that have not been identified. For locomotives that have already been inspected, we must recall and study where we did not do it thoroughly, and then re-examine it carefully. We must definitely have a clear understanding and never allow ourselves to repeat the above mistakes." The self-criticism also said: The slack season is coming to an end, and the heavy transportation task is about to arrive. Comrades from the Locomotive and Factory departments, let us join hands and strive forward.

　　济南铁路局机务科长投稿本报检讨作风
    【本报讯】济南铁路局机务处机务科科长许铁政特向本报投稿，检讨其轻视“机车大检查工作”的错误及其粗枝大叶的作风，并表示决心切实改正。来稿上说，由于他轻视机车大检查工作，未能深入和彻底检修入厂机车，曾招致列车颠覆的严重事故；并使若干机车的修理时间拖延，不能按时出厂，以致部分地影响了厂务任务不能完成，给国家造成巨大损失。
    济南铁路局于两个月前曾发出进行机车全面大检查的指示，但是他以为“整修的主要材料还没解决，机车检查工作可以缓作”，对机车检查未能重视。兖州机务段由于检查工作马虎，把报废的坏水柜轴换在ワろ１一九四五号机车上，以致该机车六月二日在井亭、临城间切轴，造成列车颠覆的严重事故。济南机务段从四月到现在，入厂修理的机车已有三台改变修程。其中如六月六日入厂的攵Ｔ６一五三六号机车，在请求修理书上说明为中修，经过再度检查才发现了该机车锅炉的顶部有的地方已经薄到三毫米，达到危险的程度，不得不改变修程。另外有合肥、徐州等段的四台也有类似的情形。因而打乱了厂务生产计划，促使部分机车拖延了出厂的时间。这时候他没有很好地检讨机务对机车保养使用的不够上做检讨，反而抱怨厂务修的不好，支持的不够。因此促成机务、厂务两处个别同志在思想上互相抵触，直接影响了工作。许铁政在检讨中最后说：“我们今后再不要忽视这个机车大检查工作，对没鉴定的机车要细密地彻底地进行检查，已经作过的机车，要再回忆和研究那里做的不彻底，再认真的复查。一定做到心中有数，决不允许我们重犯以上的错误。”检讨中又说：淡月已将过去，繁重的运输任务即要到来，机、厂两处的同志快携起手来努力前进。
