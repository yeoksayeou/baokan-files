　　The People of Lugouqiao Town Commemorate "July 7th"
　　[Our Newspaper] On the evening of July 7th, the people of Lugouqiao Town, who were first subjected to the gunfire of the Japanese invaders thirteen years ago, held a commemorative meeting for the thirteenth anniversary of the "July 7th Incident." More than 1,300 residents participated in the meeting (accounting for one-half of the town's population). At the meeting, many people painfully denounced the Japanese devils' burning and killing, the Kuomintang's looting of grain and conscription of soldiers, and the miserable situation of the common people starving to death in the year they were forced to eat mixed flour. An old man said: "In the years of Japanese devils and Kuomintang rule, every spring, the common people had to send their cotton clothes to the pawnshop in order to scrape together money to buy seeds. Now that we have our People's Government, the cotton clothes have long been taken apart, washed, and put away, waiting to be worn." The people of Lugouqiao Town made a powerful demonstration to the international war-mongers with a peaceful signature campaign a month ago, and the masses at the meeting unanimously expressed their confidence and strength in defending peace.

　　芦沟桥镇人民纪念“七七”
    【本报讯】十三年前首先遭到日本侵略者的炮火的芦沟桥镇人民于七月七日晚举行了“七七”十三周年纪念大会。参加大会的居民共一千三百余人（占全镇人口二分之一）。会上好些人沉痛地控诉了日本鬼子的烧杀、国民党的抢粮抓丁，和老百姓被逼迫吃混合面那年饿死人的惨状。一个老大爷说：“日本鬼子和国民党统治的那年头儿，一到春天，老百姓得把棉衣送到当铺里去，才能张罗买种籽。现在有咱们的人民政府，棉衣早已拆洗好放着等穿了。”芦沟桥镇的人民在一月前已用和平签名向国际战争贩子作了有力的示威，大会上群众又一致表示有信心有力量保卫和平。
