Strengthen Economic Defense Work

　　In May of this year, the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government convened a national economic defense work conference to study the current situation of economic defense work across the country and made a series of decisions on economic defense work. These decisions are very important and timely for safeguarding our national production and construction endeavors.

　　After the basic end of the mainland war, our national work has gradually shifted to focus on economic construction. Only when economic construction progresses step by step can the victory of the revolution be consolidated. Precisely because economic construction is so important to our country and people, it has become the center of sabotage activities by the enemies of the Chinese people. Today, after the Kuomintang reactionaries' millions of organized armed forces have been annihilated, they are mainly fighting us using covert methods, that is, sending many special agents to carry out sabotage activities on the Chinese mainland, especially focusing on sabotage in our financial and economic departments, attempting to hinder the construction work of the Chinese people and keep the Chinese people in a state of poverty and backwardness forever. If we do not raise our vigilance against these special agents and do not engage in a serious struggle against them, our country's economic construction will suffer great damage. The Northeast can be used as an example here. According to incomplete statistics from the Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun industrial and mining areas, and a small number of factories and mines in Jilin, Liaodong, and Songjiang, a total of 253 major counter-revolutionary sabotage incidents, both completed and attempted, occurred from last year to March of this year. Among them, the estimated value of only 19 incidents was 20.39 billion RMB. As for the losses caused by the shutdown due to the destruction of machinery and high-voltage lines, it is even more serious. For example, a factory in the Northeast suffered a loss of 900 million RMB due to a power outage of a quarter of an hour caused by the destruction of high-voltage lines. Of particular note, the central government's important price policy and trade plan confidential documents were stolen, and the loss is incalculable. These facts show that the staff of our economic departments and all state organs must not relax their vigilance against this secret sabotage activity of hidden enemies because they believe that victory has been achieved throughout the country. If one is paralyzed ideologically, it is equivalent to disarming oneself and placing oneself in a dangerous position.

　　Imperialism, especially American imperialism, is our main enemy today. That group of resolute counter-revolutionaries in Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret service system have completely become American imperialism's special agent running dogs, faithfully serving the interests of American imperialism. Chairman Mao recently pointed out at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party that the bandits, special agents, and spies dispatched and instructed by the remaining Kuomintang reactionaries who are carrying out sabotage activities on the Chinese mainland "are all instigated behind the scenes by imperialism, especially American imperialism," and "are all running dogs of imperialism." Therefore, our economic defense department's anti-espionage struggle in the future will mainly be a struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism. And this enemy is more vicious and cunning. It not only possesses modern sabotage technology, but also has more experience in secret sabotage. Therefore, this struggle is more complex and arduous. We must have a full understanding of this changed struggle situation, otherwise we will make great mistakes in the anti-espionage struggle. In addition, there are those landlord classes in our country who have been or are about to be overthrown, and they will hate and resist the People's Government, and some of them may even carry out more stubborn resistance. Some decadent speculators in the cities will also hate the People's Government because their speculative activities have gone bankrupt. All the Kuomintang reactionary remnants, landlords, decadent speculators, and the bandits and special agents who serve these reactionary forces may collude together, and under the command, organization and assistance of American imperialism, carry out a cruel struggle against us. According to existing materials, the enemy's policy for our struggle is "long-term lurking, waiting for opportunities, focusing on sabotage and assassination activities." The methods are the mutual combination of military and political, open and secret, legal and illegal, internal and external. Their sabotage methods include armed attacks, looting, destroying machines, arson, explosions, theft, assassination, stealing state secrets, spreading rumors and inciting discord, and so on.

　　Over the past year, the People's Public Security Organs and economic defense workers have waged a fierce struggle against these hidden enemies. And they have achieved great results, uncovering a large number of reactionary special agent organizations and special agents. The personnel of the economic construction departments have generally begun to pay attention to the enemy's special agent sabotage activities politically. Some economic construction departments have also established specialized production defense organizations and work, reducing or avoiding many sabotage accidents, and giving the enemy special agents considerable restrictions and blows. However, some personnel in the economic construction departments have lost their vigilance against enemy special agents and indulged in "peaceful production and construction," neglecting the defense work of production and construction. This is very dangerous and must be resolutely corrected.

　　In order to comprehensively carry out economic defense work, what should the economic construction organs in various places pay attention to?

　　First, the responsible personnel and general cadres of various economic construction departments must, in accordance with the spirit of the National Economic Defense Work Conference, quickly and conscientiously discuss specific implementation methods, and thoroughly implement this task among the broad masses of workers, so that it becomes a mass ideological weapon for preventing traitors and resisting special agents. All financial and economic units should conduct inspections of preventing traitors and resisting special agents to protect production based on specific circumstances. Party committees at all levels and the Party organizations and the broad masses of Party members in various economic construction departments should, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, actively strive to ensure the full realization of the decisions.

　　Secondly, each economic construction department should plan, step by step and with emphasis, organize a specialized team for preventing traitors and resisting special agents. Those that have already been established must be made more sound. Without such a specialized team, it is impossible to fight against hidden enemies and achieve victory. At present, our team in this regard cannot meet the requirements of the struggle situation. Leading organs at all levels should try to transfer appropriate cadres to enrich these teams. The application of this team must implement the working principles of combining specialized personnel with the masses, combining internal and external forces, and combining different departments with each other, establishing correct relationships between economic defense work and administration, the Party, trade unions, and the broad masses of workers, in order to correctly organize forces comprehensively from all aspects of the struggle, concentrate on isolating and attacking the enemy.

　　Third, all economic defense departments and economic defense organizations should vigorously establish regular investigation and research work, in order to discover the enemy in a timely manner and break the enemy's conspiracy of "long-term lurking and waiting for an opportunity to sabotage." Even if the enemy uses various faces or even progressive faces to disguise themselves, as long as we can conduct systematic and thorough investigation and research work, special agents and spies and their organizations will eventually be discovered by us and thoroughly and cleanly eliminated.

　　Fourth, leading cadres and economic defense personnel of various economic construction departments should frequently conduct anti-traitor and anti-special agent education to the broad masses of workers. Fully expose the enemy's hidden activities, conspiracies, and methods in front of the masses, and call on the masses to come up with ways to deal with enemy special agents. Do not mystify the work of preventing traitors and resisting special agents, and thus conceal the enemy's conspiracies, which objectively facilitates the enemy's sabotage activities. The method of organizing "safety teams" among the workers created by some economic construction departments in the Northeast and within the Guan is an example of the mass line in the anti-traitor and anti-special agent struggle. Experience has proven that if such safety teams are organized properly and led regularly, they can play a great role in mobilizing the masses to pay attention to economic defense work and monitoring and reporting special agents and spies.

　　Fifth, strengthening the work system and management system of various economic construction departments is one of the effective ways to prevent traitors and resist special agents. Because the vast number of employees in economic departments such as factories and mines are engaged in organized work due to production ties, therefore, establishing and improving scientific and strict production systems and management systems, especially inspection systems, machine responsibility systems, and handover systems for going to and from work, can not only strengthen the sense of responsibility and labor discipline of employees, but also effectively prevent enemy special agents from carrying out sabotage. This working method is worth vigorously promoting in various places.

　　In short, economic defense work is a new and arduous task. Leading cadres of various economic construction departments and economic defense departments must adopt a correct defense work line, and must combine specialized defense organizations with the broad masses of employees, combine defense work with production, and combine thorough and regular investigation and research with surprise inspections and handling in order to smoothly defeat the enemy.

　　There is no doubt that carrying out economic defense work on a national scale must overcome many difficulties. The first important difficulty is that the awareness of some employees is not high enough, and some special agents are mixed among the employees. Especially in the economic construction departments of the vast new areas, the situation is more complex. The reactionary Party and League organizations have not been completely destroyed, and feudal superstitious organizations and gangs are widespread, which are likely to become the basis for enemy special agent activities. Secondly, various economic construction departments lack sufficient trained defense cadres, especially cadres who understand production technology management. Specialized defense organizations and work in some industrial and mining enterprises and agencies have not been established or are not sound enough. However, it should be pointed out that these difficulties are temporary and can be completely overcome. Under the situation of national victory, the people's power is unprecedentedly strong, and the political prestige of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government is unprecedentedly high. American imperialism's aggressive forces in China have been driven out of China, and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, have been defeated. The liberation of Taiwan, although it still requires arduous struggle, is only a matter of time. This general and basic situation is a decisive condition for crushing the enemy's remaining organizational and ideological foundations in China. On our side, economic construction work is supported by the broad masses of the people, especially the working class. The people are the masters of the country, and their awareness is rapidly improving. Especially the working class is the most reliable pillar in economic defense work. As long as we are good at relying on the masses, the enemy's activities can be monitored by the broad masses. The difficulty of lacking technology can be gradually resolved. Cadres can also grow gradually. In particular, with the power in the hands of the people, the People's Public Security Organs for suppressing counter-revolutionary elements have been established throughout the country, and have already gained some experience in economic defense work. These favorable conditions put us in an overwhelming position in the struggle against enemy special agents.

　　Raise vigilance, rely on the masses, learn technology, investigate and research, we will certainly be able to eliminate these heinous hidden enemies just like we eliminated the Kuomintang bandit army.

　　加强经济保卫工作
    今年五月，中央人民政府公安部曾召集了全国经济保卫工作会议，研究了目前全国经济保卫工作情况，对于经济保卫工作作了一系列的决定，这些决定，对于保卫我们国家生产建设事业，是非常重要而适时的。
    大陆战争基本结束之后，我们国家工作，已逐步转变到以经济建设为中心。只有经济建设逐步前进，革命胜利才能巩固。正因为经济建设工作对于我们国家和人民十分重要，也就成了中国人民的敌人破坏活动的中心。在今天国民党反动派的几百万有组织的武装部队被歼灭之后，他们主要是用隐蔽的方法，和我们作斗争，即是派遣许多特务分子，在中国大陆上进行破坏活动，尤其着重在我财政经济部门中进行破坏活动，企图阻挠中国人民的建设工作，使中国人民永远处于贫穷和落后的状态。对于这些特务分子，如果我们不提高警惕性，不与之进行严重的斗争，那么我们国家的经济建设事业就会遭到很大的破坏。这里可以用东北作例子。据沈阳、鞍山、本溪、抚顺工矿地区和吉林、辽东、松江少数厂矿不完全的统计，自去年至今年三月，共发生已遂和未遂的较大的反革命破坏事件二百五十三次，其中仅十九次的估价即值二百零三亿九千万人民币。至于因机器、高压线被破坏，因而停工所受的损失，则更为严重。如东北某工厂因高压线被破坏，停电一刻钟，损失即达九亿人民币。特别值得注意的，中央政府重要的物价政策与贸易计划等机密文件曾被盗窃，其损失是无法估计的。这些事实说明，我们各经济部门及一切国家机关的工作人员，决不能以为在全国范围内已经胜利，而放松对隐蔽敌人这种秘密破坏活动的警惕性。如果是在思想上麻痹，就等于解除了自己的武装，而使自己处于危险的地位。
    帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，是今天我们的主要敌人。蒋介石匪帮特务系统中那一群坚决的反革命分子，完全成为美帝国主义的特务走卒，忠实的为美帝国主义的利益服务。毛主席最近在党的七届三中全会上曾特别指出，在中国大陆上进行破坏活动的，由国民党反动残余所派遣与指使的土匪、特务和间谍，“都有帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在背后策动”，“都是帝国主义的走狗。”因此，今后我们经济保卫部门的反特斗争，主要地是同帝国主义特别是同美帝国主义的斗争。而这个敌人则是较为凶恶，较为狡猾的。它不仅握有近代的破坏技术，而且具有较多的秘密破坏的经验。因而这个斗争就更加复杂和艰巨。对于这个变化了的斗争形势，我们必须有充分的认识，否则将会在反特斗争中犯很大的错误。此外，我们国内还有那些已被打倒或即将被打倒的地主阶级，他们是会痛恨和反抗人民政府的，其中一部分还可能进行较顽强的反抗。城市中一部分没落的投机家，由于他们投机勾当的破产，也一定会仇视人民政府。所有国民党反动残余、地主、没落的投机家以及服务于这些反动力量的土匪、特务，他们都可能勾结在一起，并在美帝国主义的指挥、组织与援助之下，对我们进行残酷的斗争。根据已有的材料看来，敌人对我们斗争的方针是“长期潜伏，等待时机，重点破坏与暗害活动”。其方式则是军事与政治、公开与秘密、合法与非法、内部与外部互相结合的。他们的破坏手段，则有武装袭击、抢劫、破坏机器、纵火、爆炸、盗窃、暗杀、窃取国家机密造谣挑拨等等。
    一年来，人民公安机关与经济保卫工作人员，对于这些隐蔽的敌人作了剧烈的斗争。而且取得了重大的成绩，破获了大批的反动特务组织和特务分子。经济建设部门人员，对敌人特务破坏活动，一般地已经从政治上开始注意，有些经济建设部门并建立了专门的生产保卫组织与工作，减少或避免了不少破坏事故，给敌特以相当的限制和打击。但是，也有某些经济建设部门人员，对敌特丧失警惕性，沉醉于“和平生产建设”，而忽略了对生产建设的保卫工作。这是很危险的，必须加以坚决纠正。
    为了全面开展经济保卫工作，各地经济建设机关，应当注意什么呢？
    第一，各经济建设部门的负责人员及一般干部，须根据全国经济保卫工作会议的精神，迅速地认真地讨论具体执行的办法，并将这一任务深入贯彻到广大职工群众中去，使之成为群众防奸反特的思想武器。各财政经济单位应根据具体情况，进行防奸反特保卫生产的检查。各级党委及各经济建设部门党的组织及广大党员，并应根据中央人民政府公安部指示的精神，积极努力以保证决定的完全实现。
    其次，各经济建设部门要有计划有步骤有重点地组织一支防奸反特的专门队伍，已经建立了的，则须使之更加健全。没有这样的专门的队伍，就不可能同隐蔽的敌人作战，并取得胜利。目前我们在这方面的队伍是不能适应斗争形势的要求的，各级领导机关应设法抽调适当的干部充实这些队伍。这支队伍的应用，必须实行专门人员与群众结合、内部与外部结合、不同部门互相结合的工作原则，建立经济保卫工作与行政、党、工会以及广大职工群众等各方面的正确关系，以便正确地从各个斗争方面综合地组织力量，集中地孤立与打击敌人。
    第三，各经济保卫部门与经济保卫组织，应以大力建立经常的调查研究工作，以便适时发现敌人，打破敌人“长期潜伏、待机破坏”的阴谋，敌人即使用各种面貌甚至用进步面貌伪装起来，只要我们能够进行系统周密的调查研究工作，特务与间谍分子及其组织终必为我所发现，而彻底干净地予以歼灭。
    第四，各经济建设部门的领导干部及经济保卫人员，应经常向广大职工群众反复进行防奸反特的教育。将敌人的隐蔽活动阴谋及其方式，在群众的面前加以充分的揭露，号召群众大家想办法来对付敌特。不要把防奸反特工作神秘化，因而把敌人的阴谋活动也隐蔽起来，这正是客观上便利了敌人的破坏活动。东北及关内某些经济建设部门所创造的在工人群众中组织“安全小组”的办法，是防奸反特斗争中群众路线的榜样。经验证明，这种安全小组如果组织得法，领导经常，对于发动群众来注意经济保卫工作，监视与检举特务、间谍分子，是有很大作用的。
    第五，加强各经济建设部门的工作制度与管理制度，是防奸反特的有效办法之一。因为各工厂矿山等经济部门的广大员工，由于生产的联系，进行着有组织的工作，因此，建立与健全科学的严密的生产制度与管理制度，特别是检查制、机器分担制、上下班交接制等，不仅可以加强职工的责任心和劳动纪律，并且可以有效地防止敌特进行破坏。这种工作方法，值得各地大力加以推行。
    总之，经济保卫工作是一个新的艰巨的任务，各经济建设部门及经济保卫部门的领导干部，必须采取正确的保卫工作路线，必须使专门保卫组织与广大员工相结合，保卫工作与生产相结合，周密的经常的调查研究与突击检查处理相结合，才能顺利地击败敌人。
    毫无疑问，开展全国规模的经济保卫工作，必须克服许多困难。第一个重要的困难是有一部分职工的觉悟程度还不高，还有些特务分子混在职工中间。特别是在广大新区的经济建设部门中，情况更为复杂。反动党团组织还未能彻底摧毁，封建迷信组织与帮会则普遍存在，这很可能成为敌人特务活动的基础。其次，各经济建设部门还缺乏足够的有锻炼的保卫干部，尤其缺少懂得管理生产技术的干部。有些工矿企业机关的专门保卫组织与工作还没有建立起来或者还不够健全。但是，应当指出，这些困难是暂时的，是完全可以克服的。在全国大胜利形势下，人民力量空前强大，中国共产党和人民政府的政治威信空前高涨。美帝国主义在中国的侵略势力已被赶出中国，其走狗国民党反动派已被打垮，台湾的解放，虽然还须作艰苦斗争，但只是时间问题。这一总的基本形势，对于粉碎敌人在中国残存的若干组织基础与思想基础，是决定性的条件。在我们方面，经济建设工作为广大人民首先是工人阶级所拥护，人民是国家的主人，他们的觉悟性正在迅速提高。尤其是工人阶级在经济保卫工作中是最可靠的支柱。只要善于依靠群众，就能使敌人的活动受到广大群众的监视。缺乏技术的困难是可以逐步解决的。干部也是可以逐渐生长的。特别是政权掌握在人民手里，镇压反革命分子的人民公安机关已经在全国建立，而且已取得若干经济保卫工作的经验。这些有利条件，使我们在对敌人特务斗争中处于压倒优势的地位。
    提高警惕，依靠群众，学习技术，调查研究，我们一定能如同消灭国民党匪军一样，消灭这些万恶的隐蔽的敌人。
