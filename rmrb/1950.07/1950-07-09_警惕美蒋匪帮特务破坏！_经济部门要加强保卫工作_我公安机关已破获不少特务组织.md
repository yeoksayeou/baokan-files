　　Beware of the KMT-American Bandit Gang's Sabotage by Special Agents!
    Economic Departments Must Strengthen Security Work
    Our Public Security Organs Have Cracked Many Special Agent Organizations
    [Report from our newspaper] Under the instigation of its master, American imperialism, the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries have systematically planted some special agents on the Chinese mainland, and are continuing to send special agents to infiltrate the mainland to sabotage the economic construction of the Chinese people. Our People's Public Security Organs have cracked many of these special agent organizations and their sabotage activities. For example, the so-called "Fifth Detachment of the Second Column of the Shandong People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," dispatched by the bandit Mao Sen and annihilated in the Qingdao area in May of this year, had as its main tasks the looting of granaries and enterprises, blowing up military industrial facilities and transportation constructions, printing counterfeit money, and disrupting finance. They also brought a lot of blasting equipment. During the campaign to liberate Hainan Island in April, our army seized a resolution from the sixth meeting of the Kuomintang bandit gang's Political Affairs Committee regarding the large-scale counterfeiting of RMB to disrupt our financial market. The "Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Guangdong Eastern Meixian Group," captured by the Guangdong Public Security Organs on the 27th of last month, also had as its main task the focused sabotage of our economic construction work and disruption of the financial market. Moreover, the bandit special agent case cracked at the Xinhua Tin Mine in Hunan in June revealed the designation of the "Sino-US Central Bureau of Statistics Special Agent Office," proving that these heinous special agent bandits were mainly sabotaging the economic construction of New China.
    One of the key areas for enemy special agents to sabotage our economic construction is transportation. In the Hengyang Railway Bureau Management Area in Hunan, there were multiple instances of sabotage in a month and a half from April 1st to May 15th, resulting in significant losses of wires, spikes, sleepers, steel rails, and fishplates, and derailments of locomotives and freight cars. In several bureaus and stations along the Jinpu, Qingji and other railways, organized hidden special agents have been discovered this year. These bandits attempted to control our railway garrison armed forces, steal transportation intelligence and transportation plans, and use Taoist priests to deceive backward masses into organizing riots. These bandits have all been uncovered by us in advance.
    Another key area for special agents to sabotage economic construction is in factories, mines, and other places. In factories, they mainly sabotage important machines, power equipment, etc., with the main methods being explosions, stealing parts, cutting high-voltage lines, and other technical sabotage. For example, Wang Lanfang, a special agent from the No. 3 Military Supply Bureau Rubber Factory in Shenyang, was the "Director of the Kuomintang Anti-Espionage Confidentiality Group." In his work, he deliberately misallocated rubber raw materials, rendering 800,000 pairs of rubber shoes completely useless. Accidents caused by the sabotage of high-voltage lines by special agents have occurred in Taiyuan, Pingwang and other places this year. In Qingdao No. 3 Textile Factory, reactionary party and youth league special agent elements secretly caused trouble, resulting in as many as eleven sabotage incidents in the twenty days from May 21st to June 10th, causing considerable damage to machines, yarn, and other materials.
    Another focus of special agent sabotage is the theft of economic intelligence, such as industrial plans, prices, finance, and import and export trade plans. This has also been discovered in the financial and economic organs of the Central People's Government. When carrying out sabotage, special agents often disguise themselves as progressive, striving to infiltrate party, youth league, and trade union organizations or public security and security departments to carry out long-term lurking and seize opportunities to sabotage. For example, in the Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory, the special agent Wu Guiren infiltrated the Youth League and became the chairman of the trade union and secretary of the Youth League branch. He took the opportunity to set fire to the raw jute pool, greatly affecting the factory's production.
    The above facts are only a small part of the economic sabotage incidents carried out by special agent bandits. These facts fully demonstrate the seriousness of the enemy special agents' deliberate sabotage of our economic construction departments. All economic construction departments must pay attention to economic security work.

　　警惕美蒋匪帮特务破坏！
    经济部门要加强保卫工作
    我公安机关已破获不少特务组织
    【本报讯】国民党反动派残余在其主子美帝国主义指使之下，在中国大陆有计划地埋伏了一些特务，并且正在继续派遣特务，潜入大陆，破坏中国人民的经济建设事业。这种特务组织与破坏行为，已被我人民公安机关破获不少。如今年五月间，在青岛地区歼灭的由毛匪森所派出的所谓“山东人民反共救国军第二纵队第五支队”，即以抢劫粮库、企业，爆破军工设施、交通建筑，印制伪钞、捣乱金融，为其主要任务。他们并带来了很多爆破器材。在四月解放海南岛战役中，我军曾缴获国民党匪帮政务委员会第六次会议关于大量伪造人民币，捣乱我金融市场的决议案。上月二十七日，广东公安机关捕获之“东南人民反共救国军粤东梅县小组”，亦以重点破坏我经济建设工作，捣乱金融市场为其主要任务。而六月间在湖南新化锡矿山破获之匪特案中，更发现“中美中统特务处”的番号，证明这些万恶的特务匪徒是主要破坏新中国经济建设的。
    敌特破坏我经济建设工作的重点之一，是交通运输。湖南衡阳铁路局管理区，在四月一日至五月十五日一个半月中，被破坏多次，损失电线、道钉、枕木、钢轨、鱼尾板甚多，机车货车均发生颠覆事件。在津浦、青济等铁路沿线若干局、站，今年均发现有组织的暗藏特务，这些匪徒企图控制我铁路警备武装，窃取运输情报及运输计划，利用道门欺骗落后群众组织暴动。这些匪徒均已事先为我破获。
    特务破坏经济建设的另一重点，是各工厂矿山等。在工厂中，主要破坏各重要机器、动力设备等，其主要手段是爆炸、偷窃零件、割断高压线及其他技术性的破坏。如沈阳军需三局橡胶厂特务王兰芳，是“国民党防谍保密组主任”，在工作中故意将制胶原料配错，使八十万双胶鞋全部作废。太原、平旺等地，今年均发生高压线因特务破坏而停电的事故。青岛中纺三厂反动党团特务分子，暗中作怪，在五月二十一日至六月十日的二十天中，发生破坏事件达十一次之多，使机器、纱布等受到不小的损失。
    特务分子另一个破坏重点是偷窃经济情报，如工业计划、物价、金融及出进口贸易计划等，这在中央人民政府财经机关中亦有发现。特务分子进行破坏时，常伪装进步，力图混入党、团及工会组织或公安保卫部门中，进行长期潜伏，乘机破坏。如在沈阳麻袋厂中，特务吴桂仁混入青年团内，并且当了工会主任和团支书记，他乘机放火烧毁了原麻池，使该厂生产大受影响。
    上述事实，不过是特务匪徒们所进行的经济破坏事件的一小部分。这些事实充分说明敌特对我经济建设部门处心积虑进行破坏的严重性。一切经济建设部门均须注意经济保卫工作。
