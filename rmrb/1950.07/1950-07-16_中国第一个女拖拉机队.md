　　China's First Women's Tractor Team
　　Zhang Zhenyi
　　Look, our tractor
　　Carries an iron plow
　　Cultivating ten thousand miles of grassland
　　We are the power of production
　　Drive on! Drive on!
　　Drive all over the motherland…
　　　　　　——Song sung by female tractor drivers of the Dédū Méngyá Township Normal School Farm.

　　The women's tractor team of the Dédū Méngyá Township Normal School Farm in Heilongjiang Province was officially established on June 3rd, with a total of eleven members. This is China's first women's tractor team.

　　This women's tractor team has five drivers, five assistants, and one cultural instructor, managing three machines. Liang Jun is the captain, Wu Yuzhen is the cultural instructor, and the remaining nine are—Tian Shufang, Chen Yaru, Chen Yan, Huang Guizhen, Liu Shuxin, Sun Yingxin, Song Rong, He Xiufang, and Zhang Fengyan.

　　In May 1948, Liang Jun graduated from the Bei'an Tractor Training Class and returned to the Dédū Méngyá Township Normal School, driving a tractor. The students were very excited to welcome her. At that time, Chen Yaru was very moved and enthusiastically wanted to learn how to drive a tractor to serve the country's construction. Liang Jun patiently helped her. Last spring, Chen Yaru joined the tractor team, facing wind and rain every day, choked by smoke, baked by the machine, and often camped out in the fields… After arduous study, she finally mastered this skill.

　　As soon as the news spread that Chen Yaru could fill in as a driver, Tian Shufang, Chen Yan, and Huang Guizhen discussed it together and also signed up to join the tractor team. It was autumn at that time, and during breaks in the field, they sat among the hazel bushes listening to Liang Jun explain the principles of the machine. The roaring of the tractors, day and night, didn’t stop them from studying, day and night.

　　When the People's Republic of China was founded, Principal Gao Heng (now the Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education, still concurrently the principal of Méngyá Township Normal School) sent a letter from Shenyang encouraging the students to study hard, "To bravely advance under the banner of the five-star red flag and build a motherland with a bright and unlimited future." Leading comrades are all enthusiastically caring for their progress and their health. Leaders often instructed the technicians: "Teach patiently and take care of their bodies." When they were studying, they refused to rest even when they had minor illnesses. The leaders and comrades urged them to seek treatment and did not allow them to do heavy work while sick. In this way, their learning became even more confident and active.

　　Last winter, when threshing wheat, the temperature was more than thirty degrees below zero. The five of them, like the male students, worked hard in the severe cold, and did not rest even when their hands were frostbitten.

　　Their rapid progress exceeded most people's expectations. This year, in the first month of the lunar calendar, the trainees took a tractor operation exam. Chen Yaru sat in the driver's seat of the "Stalin" tractor, with the technician sitting next to her. When approaching a sharp turn, everyone was worried about her. The silkworm gear rattled, and the engine roared deafeningly, making her a little uneasy. However, relying on the experience gained from more than eight months of hard study, she calmly adjusted the "throttle" twice and passed smoothly. In this exam, she passed as a driver; Tian Shufang and Chen Yan, who had studied for five months, passed as first-class assistants; and Huang Guizhen passed as a second-class assistant.

　　After the exam, they proposed to strive to all become drivers in the spring. They helped each other and studied hard. This year in March, Liang Jun returned from the Asian Women's Conference, and the female team members ran out of the garage, shook her hand with hands full of kerosene, and asked her admiringly, "Did you see Chairman Mao?"

　　They scrambled to look at the illustrated magazines Liang Jun brought back from the Women's Conference. They saw the happy life of Soviet collective farms and saw Angelina, the captain of the first Soviet women's tractor team, and excitedly thought of the bright future of New China.

　　On "March 8" Women's Day, they had requested the leaders to establish a women's tractor team. At that time, the leadership considered that the number of female tractor drivers was still small and the technology was not yet mature, so they did not allow it. Now, five more strong young women have joined the team; Tian Shufang, Chen Yan, and Huang Guizhen have also been promoted to drivers. Therefore, on June 3rd, a ceremony was held to officially establish the women's tractor team.

　　The next day, the female tractor drivers rode in three tractors, galloping across this vast prairie. In front of the driver's cab was a red flag given to them by the Party and the government, surrounded by colorful and beautiful wildflowers. The tractors roared continuously, the red flag fluttered in the wind, and the female team members sang in unison:

　　“Oh! Fire plow, you are a steel warhorse
　　Fire plow, you are our dear comrade
　　You make a pleasant sound
　　We have arrived at the time for harrowing
　　We travel all over the fields
　　Driving the divine horse!”

### 中国第一个女拖拉机队

　　中国第一个女拖拉机队
    张振义
    看，我们的拖拉机
    身上带着铁犁
    耕起了草原万里
    我们是生产的动力
    开哟！开哟！
    开遍了祖国的大地……
              ——德都萌芽乡师农场女拖拉机手唱的歌。
    黑龙江省德都萌芽乡师农场的女拖拉机队在六月三日正式成立了，队员共十一人。这是中国第一个女拖拉机队。
    这个女拖拉机队有着五名驾驶员、五名助手和一个文化辅导员，管理着三部机器。梁军是队长，吴玉珍是文化辅导员，其余的九个人是——田淑芳、陈娅茹、陈彦、黄桂珍、刘淑新、孙迎新、宋荣、何秀芳和张凤燕。
    一九四八年五月，梁军在北安拖拉机训练班毕业，开着拖拉机回到德都萌芽乡师范学校来。同学们都很兴奋地去迎接她。那时，陈娅茹非常感动，也热情地要学会开拖拉机，为祖国建设服务。梁军就耐心地帮助她。去年春天，陈娅茹就加入拖拉机队，每天风里来、雨里去，烟呛，机器烤，还常常在地里打小宿……。经过艰苦的学习，她到底学会了这门技术。
    陈娅茹能顶班开车的消息一传出去，田淑芳、陈彦、黄桂珍在一块商量后，也报名参加了拖拉机队。那时正是秋天，在地里休息的时候，她们坐在榛柴棵里，听梁军讲机器原理。拖拉机不分日夜的轰鸣，她们也不分昼夜地忙着学习。
    中华人民共和国成立的时候，校长高衡同志（现在的黑龙江省文教厅长仍兼萌芽乡师范学校的校长）从沈阳来信鼓励同学们努力学习，“要在五星红旗招展下，奋勇前进，建设前途无限美好的祖国”。领导同志都在热心地关怀着她们的进步，关怀着她们的健康。首长常常嘱咐技师：“要耐心地教，要照顾她们的身体。”她们在学习时，有了小病不肯休息。首长和同志们都催促她们去治疗，不让她们在病中做重活。这样，她们学习更加充满信心，更加积极努力了。
    去年冬天打麦子时，温度在零下三十多度。她们五个，和男同学一样，在严寒里奋勉工作，手冻坏了也不肯休息。
    她们进步的迅速，出乎一般人的预料。今年正月，学员举行拖拉机操纵考试。陈娅茹坐在“斯特兹”的机座上驾驶，技师坐在旁边。当开到急弯时，大家都为她担心。蚕轮咔咔的响，发动机轰隆震耳，她有些不安。可是，凭着八个多月努力学习的经验，她沉着地摆了两下“油门”，就顺利的过去了。这次考试中，她考上了驾驶员；学了五个月的田淑芳、陈彦，考上了一等助手；黄桂珍考上了二等助手。
    考试以后，她们提出要在春季里争取全当上驾驶员。她们互相帮助，努力学习。今年三月，梁军从亚洲妇代会开会回来，女队员们从车库里跑出来，带着满手火油就和她握手，并且钦羡地问她：“看见毛主席没有？”
    她们抢着看梁军从妇代会带回来的画刊。她们看到苏联集体农庄的幸福生活，看到苏联第一个女拖拉机队队长安格里娜，便兴奋地想到了新中国美好的未来。
    “三八”妇女节的时候，她们曾经要求上级成立女拖拉机队。那时，领导上考虑到女拖拉机驾驶员人数还少，技术还不够成熟，没有允许。现在，又有五名健壮的女青年入了队；田淑芳、陈彦、黄桂珍也都已升了驾驶员。因此，在六月三号，举行了仪式，正式成立了女拖拉机队。
    第二天，女拖拉机驾驶员们分乘着三台拖拉机，奔驰在这辽阔无边的大草原上。司机棚前插着党和政府送给她们的一面红旗，周围插满了各色美丽的野花。拖拉机不住的轰鸣，红旗随风飘展，女队员们齐声地唱着：
    “哦！火犁，你是钢铁的战马
    火犁，你是我们亲爱的战友
    你发出愉快的声音
    我们已到了开耙时候
    我们走遍田野
    驾着神马驰行！……”
