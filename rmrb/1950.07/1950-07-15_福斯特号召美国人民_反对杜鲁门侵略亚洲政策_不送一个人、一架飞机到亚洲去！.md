　　Foster Calls on the American People
    Oppose Truman's Policy of Aggression in Asia
    Not a Single Person, a Single Plane to Asia!
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th] According to TASS, New York, 13th: The Worker's Daily published an article by Foster entitled "Truman's War in Asia." Foster pointed out that the Truman government, after Chiang Kai-shek's defeat, continued to use American newspapers to spread lies, saying that it would soon formulate a "new policy" towards Asia following the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Foster wrote: "At present, we have already seen a naked policy of aggression against the broad masses of the Asian people for the sake of a small gang of defeated and discredited landlords, usurers, and other reactionaries." Regarding the question of why President Truman launched the aggression against Korea, Foster replied: "The direct cause of Truman's actions is due to a realization and the resulting fear and disappointment. This realization is that the United States' foreign policy in the Far East has failed, and despite all the resistance from the United States, the Asian people are determined to liberate themselves from the shackles of imperialism. Truman is also afraid of the growing peace movement in the United States and around the world."
    Foster finally called on the American people to resolutely oppose the war of aggression under the slogan of "Hands Off Korea." He wrote: Not a single person, a single plane, a single warship, a single dollar must be sent to Asia. He also wrote: "Peace-loving American people should demand an immediate cessation of the reactionary aggression against Korea and other Asian countries. Organized labor, first of all, has the most fundamental interest and responsibility to use its enormous power to break the clutches of Wall Street imperialists reaching out to the people of Korea and other Asian countries."

　　福斯特号召美国人民
    反对杜鲁门侵略亚洲政策
    不送一个人、一架飞机到亚洲去！
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约十三日讯：工人日报刊载福斯特所著《杜鲁门在亚洲的战争》一文。福斯特指出：杜鲁门政府在蒋介石失败后仍不断地利用美国报纸散布谰言，说不久将遵循马歇尔计划与杜鲁门主义拟就对亚洲的“新政策”。福斯特写道：“目前，我们已经看到一个为了一小撮已被打败与声名狼藉的地主、高利贷者与其他反动分子的匪帮，对亚洲人民广大群众进行侵略的赤裸裸的政策了。”对于杜鲁门总统为什么发动侵略朝鲜的这一问题，福斯特回答称：“杜鲁门行动的直接原因是由于一种认识和由此而生的恐惧与失望。这种认识就是：美国在远东的外交政策已经失败，尽管美国的种种阻力，亚洲人民已决意把他们自己从帝国主义的桎梏中解放出来。杜鲁门也害怕美国和世界各地日益增长的和平运动。”
    福斯特最后号召美国人民在“不许干涉朝鲜”的口号下坚决地反对侵略战争。他写道：必须不送一个人、一架飞机、一艘军舰、一元钱到亚洲去。他又写道：“爱好和平的美国人民应该要求立即停止对朝鲜和亚洲其他国家的反动侵略。有组织的工人首先有最基本的利益与责任，用它巨大的力量打断华尔街帝国主义者伸向朝鲜和亚洲其他各国人民的魔掌。”
