(Our Newspaper Taiyuan Dispatch) Shanxi Province's economic departments are vigorously adjusting public-private relations according to the instructions of the Central People's Government and the Shanxi Provincial Government, and are helping private industrial and commercial enterprises overcome temporary difficulties in various ways.

    The Provincial Finance Committee invited relevant economic departments on May 19 to discuss the adjustment of public-private relations, and jointly formed a Private Industry Guidance Committee with private industrialists and businessmen. Twenty-three cadres were transferred to form seven groups for cotton weaving, ironwork, silk and cloth, grain, transportation, timber, department stores, and sundry goods to conduct in-depth discussions in various industries to understand the difficulties of each industry as a basis for adjusting the plan.

        Adjusting Retail and Wholesale and Regional Price Differences to Ensure Smooth Circulation of Goods and Profitable Private Merchants

    As of June 23, state-owned specialized companies and economic departments have made a series of adjustments based on the requirements and specific difficulties of private industries. First, according to the instructions of the Department of Commerce, the difference between wholesale and retail prices and regional prices was adjusted. In terms of retail prices, the price was increased by 5.3% to 9.3% compared to the wholesale price, depending on the situation of various commodities. The difference between the wholesale and retail prices of various types of cloth adjusted by department stores was 6.8%, and the difference for department store items was 5.3% to 7.3%. Private merchants were given a preferential discount of 98% and 98.5% based on the wholesale price, so that private retailers had legitimate profits. In terms of regional differences, the differences in various commodities were adjusted according to the distance from the place of origin to the place of sale, traffic conditions, and the amount of freight. Grain reached a maximum of 55%; ginned cotton 6.88% to 10.5%; yarn and cloth 5.16% to 7.47%. The regional difference in local products was also adjusted so that general private merchants could obtain a net profit of 4%. In terms of taxation, the Provincial Taxation Bureau also made necessary simplifications and adjustments to the collection procedures, tax items, and tax rates. At the same time, it was decided to arrange the industrial and commercial tax for each quarter in advance so that those who bear the burden have sufficient time to conduct deliberations in order to achieve fairness and rationality.

        The Government Provides Processing Loans to Help Solve Production and Sales Difficulties

    After reviewing the past bias in lending to private industrial and commercial enterprises, the People's Bank decided to systematically provide loans to support private industrial and commercial enterprises from June, and extended the loan period to two months for commerce and three months for industry. By June 16, more than 1.89 billion yuan had been loaned out. The Railway Bureau signed processing contracts with 16 private iron factories in Taiyuan, such as Jinfeng, etc. The Industry Department entrusted private cotton weaving industry to weave face bags with 6,000 bundles of cotton yarn. The cotton yarn and cloth company also appropriately increased the standard of exchanging yarn for cloth; and purchased more than 4,000 unsold cloths from private merchants. This solved the production and sales difficulties of the iron and cotton weaving industries.

        Private Industries Face the Countryside, and Product Sales Gradually Recover

    Under the leadership of the trade union, workers and shop assistants in various private industries also actively assisted the capitalists to overcome difficulties together. The first is to help the capitalists change their business policies, so that the business situation tends to improve. For example, Shixinghao Grocery Store was founded in the first year of Guangxu of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. The soy sauce, vinegar and other non-staple foods produced were sold to Datong, Pingyao, and Jiexiu before the Anti-Japanese War. After the Anti-Japanese War, due to the devastation of the Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, it was heavily in debt. After liberation, due to ideological concerns of the capitalists, they were unwilling to actively operate, and the business was almost at a standstill. Later, with the assistance of the labor side, it was decided to produce more non-staple foods such as oil, soy sauce, and vinegar needed by the citizens, and less high-end foods, and strive to restore the old sales channels, and the business turned around. Manager Xin Deyuan said: "It's true that three people have one heart, and loess turns into gold." Four grain stores including Sanhecheng went to the countryside to purchase grain. In 18 days, they purchased more than 264,000 catties of grain, and each catty could get a profit of 20 yuan to 50 yuan. This not only reduced the difficulty for farmers to sell grain, but also reduced part of the transportation costs. In addition, the labor side also assisted the capitalists to change their ideas of seeking exorbitant profits and improper behaviors of cutting corners, and established business methods of small profits but quick turnover and genuine goods at fair prices. Yu Da Iron Factory has always operated with high profits, which made the business gradually decrease, and the workers had no work to do. Later, under the persuasion of the workers, the capitalists adopted the business method of small profits but quick turnover, and as a result, they received a lot of work, and the workers could not finish the overtime work. When Jin Yi Iron Factory contracted to make parts for Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Taiyuan Railway Bureau, they forced workers to cut corners, and the goods made could not be delivered. After the establishment of the CCP branch in the factory, it was proposed that labor and management should unite and negotiate, do a good job in production, improve output and quality, and oppose cutting corners. As a result, the ten-day plan can often be completed in eight days, and the substandard goods are reduced to only 2%. The capitalists also realized the policies of the People's Government, dispelled ideological concerns, changed their incorrect views on the workers, and actively produced. It is now planning to add another sand casting factory to expand production.

    Some industrialists and businessmen saw the government's determination to adjust public-private relations and actively support the development of legitimate private industry and commerce, and also changed their negative emotions, and determined their own business policies and changed their business methods according to market demand. Some also carried out conversion or partial conversion. For example, the cotton weaving industry checked out the reason why their products could not be sold because the quality was not good, and the price was too high. Now they are appropriately dividing the labor with large factories according to the needs of the market, weaving more plaid cloth, and conducting joint operations, in order to concentrate funds and manpower, improve technology, improve quality, reduce expenses, and reduce costs. Some cotton weaving households have also converted manual looms into electric looms, which has improved the output and quality, thereby reducing costs and having sales channels.

        Shutdowns Basically Stopped, and Openings Gradually Increased

    After the government's adjustments in various aspects and the efforts of private industrialists and businessmen, the phenomenon of shutdowns has basically stopped, and the number of openings has gradually increased. In early May, 200 households closed down and 64 households opened, but in late May, only 16 households closed down and 19 households opened. From June 1 to June 8, 30 households opened and only 8 households closed. Market transactions are also becoming increasingly active. In early June, Taiyuan City traded 5,800 bolts of various colors of cloth, an increase of more than 1,600 bolts compared with late May. 1,300 bundles of cotton yarn, 1,086 stones of edible salt, an increase of 462 dans compared with late May. The transaction volume of private merchants accounted for 54.8% of the total transaction volume. Material exchanges are also becoming more normal. The price of wheat in Taiyuan is 19.38% higher than that in Linfen, which is 4.25% higher than the 14.71% stipulated by the Department of Commerce. The historical habit of wheat flowing north has been restored. The number of foreign grain merchants coming to Shanxi to purchase grain is increasing. From June 16 to June 22, various grains totaling more than 463,000 catties flowed from Taiyuan, Yuci, and Yangquan to Beijing, Qingdao, and Jinan in seven days.

    However, at present, some industrialists and businessmen still lack the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties, and have a mentality of simply relying on the government. Some private merchants proposed that in addition to giving private merchants a preferential discount of 95%, state-owned specialized companies should also increase the retail price by 5% according to the list price. Some also do not actively raise funds, but demand unlimited long-term loans from the government. Obviously, these requirements are not entirely in line with the policy spirit of benefiting both public and private interests and overall consideration.

　　山西各经济部门
    大力调整公私关系
    部分厂商主动克服困难的精神还很差
    【本报太原讯】山西省各经济部门正根据中央人民政府及山西省府指示，大力调整公私关系，从各方面扶助私营工商业克服暂时困难。
    该省财委会五月十九日即邀集有关各经济部门研讨了调整公私关系问题，并与私营工商业者共同组成私营行业指导委员会，抽调干部二十三人，组成棉织、铁工、绸布、粮食、运输、木业、百货、杂货等七个小组，深入各行业召开座谈会，调查了解各行业的困难，以便作为调整方案的根据。
            调整零售批发与地区差价使货畅其流私商有利可图
    至六月二十三日止，各国营专业公司和经济部门根据私营行业的要求和具体困难，做了一系列的调整。首先根据商业厅指示，调整了批发与零售以及地区间物价的差额。在零售价方面分别按各种商品的情况，比批发价提高了百分之五·三到九·三。百货公司调整各种布类的批发价和零售价的差额是百分之六·八，百货类的差额是百分之五·三到七·三。并按批发价给予私商九八和九八五扣的优待。使私营零售商有了正当的利润。在地区差额上也根据从产地到销地的路程远近、交通条件和运费大小调整了各种商品的差额。粮食最高达百分之五十五；皮棉百分之六·八八至百分之一○·五；纱布百分之五·一六至百分之七·四七。土产地区差额也调整到一般私商能获得百分之四的纯利。在税收方面，也由省税务局对征收手续和税目、税率作了必要的简化和调整。同时决定提前布置每季的工商业税，使负担者有充足的时间进行评议，以求得合理公平。
            政府以加工贷款扶助产销困难得到了解决
    人民银行在检讨了过去对私营工商业者放款的偏向后，决定自六月份起有计划地贷款扶植私营工商业，并且把放款时间延长到商业两个月，工业三个月。到六月十六日止已贷出十八亿九千余万元。又铁路局与太原市晋丰等十六家私营铁工厂订立了加工合同，工业厅以六千捆棉纱，委托私营棉织业织面袋。花纱布公司也适当地提高了以纱换布的标准；并收购了私商的滞销布匹四千余匹。这样就解决了铁工、棉织两业的产销困难。
            私营行业面向农村产品销路逐渐恢复
    各私营行业中的工人、店员在工会的领导下，亦积极地协助资方共同克服困难。首先是帮助资方改变了经营方针，使营业情况趋向好转。如世兴号杂货庄创建于满清光绪元年，所产酱、醋等副食品在抗战以前曾销到大同、平遥、介休一带。抗日战争后因受到日寇、阎匪的摧残，负债累累。解放后因资方有思想顾虑，不愿积极经营，营业几陷停顿。后来在劳方协助下，确定多做市民需要的油、酱、醋等副食品，少做高贵食品，争取恢复旧日销路，生意遂有了转机。经理辛德元说：“真是三人一条心，黄土变成金。”三合成等四家粮店，自面向农村，亲到乡下购粮后，在十八天内即购到粮食二十六万四千余斤，每斤可得利二十元到五十元。这样既减少了农民出售粮食的困难，又减少了一部贩运费。此外劳方又协助资方转变贪图暴利的思想和偷工减料的不正当行为，树立了薄利广销、货真价廉的经营方法。裕大铁工厂一贯是以厚利经营，使得营业逐渐减少，工人无活可做。后来资方在工人的劝导下，采用薄利广销的经营方法，结果揽得活很多，工人加班都做不完。晋义铁工厂包做太原钢铁厂和太原铁路局的机件时，强迫工人偷工减料，做的货交不了。该厂中共支部建立后，即提出劳资双方团结协商，搞好生产，提高产量、质量，反对偷工减料。结果，往往十天的计划八天就能完成，而且不合标准的货减少到只有百分之二。资方也因此认识了人民政府的政策，解除了思想顾虑，改变了对工人的不正确看法，积极生产。目前正计划再增加一个翻砂厂，扩大生产。
    一部分工商业家看到了政府决心调整公私关系，积极扶助正当私营工商业发展的措施后，也转变了消极情绪，纷纷根据市场需求，确定自己的经营方针，改变经营方法。有的并进行了转业或部分转业。如棉织业在检查出自己的产品销售不了的原因是质量不好，和价钱过大后，现正依据市场上的需要和大工厂适当分工，多织花格布，并进行联合经营，以便集中资金和人力，改进技术、提高质量、减少开支、降低成本。一部分棉织业户并把人力机改装成电力织机，使产量质量都有提高，因而减低了成本，有了销路。
            歇业基本停止  开业日渐增加
    经过政府从各方面的调整和私营工商业者的努力，歇业现象基本上已告停止，开业的日渐增加。五月上旬停业的二百户，开业的六十四户，到下旬歇业的只有十六户，开业的十九户。六月一日到八日开业的有三十户，歇业的只有八户。市场成交也日益活跃。六月上旬太原市成交各色布五千八百匹，较五月下旬增加一千六百余匹。棉纱一千三百捆，食盐一千零八十六石，较五月下旬增加四百六十二担。私商交易量占整个交易额的百分之五十四点八。物资交流也日趋正常，太原小麦价格比临汾高百分之十九点三八，比商业厅规定的百分之十四点七一还高出百分之四点二五。小麦北流的历史习惯已经恢复。外埠粮商来晋购粮者日益增多。从六月十六日到二十二日七天中，太原、榆次、阳泉三地流往北京、青岛、济南各种粮食共四十六万三千余斤。
    但目前尚有一部分工商业家，还缺乏主动克服困难的精神，有单纯依赖政府的思想。有的私商提出：各国营专业公司除了给私商批发九五扣的优待外，零售价还应该按牌价再提高百分之五。也有的自己不主动筹集资金，而是无限制地要求政府能长期贷款。显然，这些要求都是与公私两利、统筹兼顾的政策精神不尽相合的。
