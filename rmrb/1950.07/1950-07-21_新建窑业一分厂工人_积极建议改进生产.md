　　Workers of the Newly Built Kiln Factory Branch No. 1
    Actively Suggest Production Improvements
    Chen Jingyao, the foreman of the machine room of the Newly Built Kiln Factory Branch No. 1, suggested sprinkling a layer of sand on the wet bricks, which solved the loss caused by the sticking of soft bricks after they were placed on the drying racks, and ensured that the fired bricks met the specifications. Bao Fenglin, a foreman of the factory, suggested using livestock to pull the soil, saving manpower for digging the soil. Bao Fenglin and Liu Yunsen also suggested changing the tracks at both ends of the railway to double tracks, so that empty cars could be parked directly on the other track to avoid delays. Before using livestock, eighty-nine workers transported soil, piling up sixty cubic meters of soil per day, and all the digging was contracted out, averaging seven and a half jin of corn per cubic meter of soil. Now, including those raising and herding the livestock, there are only seventy-nine people, and four livestock. They dig and transport one hundred cubic meters of soil per day, saving 750 jin of corn per day.

　　新建窑业一分厂工人
    积极建议改进生产
    新建窑业一分厂机器房工长陈景尧，建议在湿坯子上洒上一层沙子，解决了砖坯上了坯岗后因土软相沾的损失，并使烧出的砖能达到规格。该厂工长包凤林建议改用牲口拉土，节省下人工去打土。包凤林、刘云森又建议将铁轨两头改铺双轨，使空车下来直接停放在另一轨道上，以免耽误时间。改用牲口前，运土工人八十九名，每天堆土六十方，且打土全包给外人，每方土平均玉米七斤半，现在连饲养牲口和赶牲口的人在内只七十九人，外牲口四头，每天打土运土达一百方，每日节省玉米达七百五十斤。
