Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 22nd: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 22nd, at the Third Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on the 21st, Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, read aloud in German the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the CPSU to the Congress. The congratulatory message declared:

	"The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union congratulates the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—the vanguard of the German working class and all working people—on its Third Congress. Loyal to the revolutionary traditions of the German proletariat, the Socialist Unity Party, in the struggle to thoroughly eradicate militarism and reactionary forces, and in the struggle to eliminate the consequences of fascism that plunged the German people into war, is the main force of all democratic and progressive forces in Germany.

	In the past five years, the Party, together with other democratic groups, has achieved great success in the democratic construction of Germany, and has ensured steady progress in economic and cultural aspects and the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of the people.

	The Socialist Unity Party, with all its efforts to create a democratic, peace-loving German state, is thereby making a historically significant contribution to the cause of maintaining peace in Europe.

	The Central Committee of the CPSU wishes the Socialist Unity Party new achievements in its struggle to further consolidate the Party's ranks organizationally and ideologically, in its struggle for the victory of the principles of proletarian internationalism, in its struggle to strengthen the united front of all democratic forces in the country, and in its struggle to consolidate world peace.

	We warmly congratulate the successful holding of the Third Congress of the Socialist Unity Party. This congress will play an important role in the cause of creating a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany."

The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the CPSU was drowned in a storm of enthusiastic applause.

At the suggestion of the presidium, the congress, with great enthusiasm, passed a telegram of respect to Stalin. The telegram, after expressing gratitude to Stalin for his consistent help to the German people, stated: "In order to fulfill its mission as the vanguard of the German people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany must become a new type of party modeled after the Lenin-Stalin Party. To achieve this, it is first necessary to master Marxism-Leninism and learn from the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."

    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：在二十一日的德国统一社会党第三次代表大会上，苏联共产党中央委员会书记苏斯洛夫用德文宣读了联共中央致大会的贺词。贺词宣称：
    “苏联共产党中央委员会祝贺德国统一社会党——德国工人阶级和全体劳动人民的先锋队——第三届代表大会。忠诚于德国无产阶级革命传统的统一社会党，在彻底根除军国主义与反动势力的斗争中，在消除法西斯主义曾使德国人民投入战争的后果的斗争中，是德国一切民主与进步力量的主要力量。
    在过去五年中，党与其他民主团体一道，在德国的民主建设事业上获得了巨大的成就，而且保证了经济与文化各方面的稳步前进和广大人民群众生活水平的改善。
    统一社会党以一切努力创建民主的、爱好和平的德意志国家，从而正在对维护欧洲和平的事业作着具有历史意义的贡献。
    联共中央祝德国统一社会党在其争取进一步在组织上与思想上巩固党的队伍的斗争中，争取无产阶级国际主义原则的胜利的斗争中，争取加强全国一切民主力量的统一战线的斗争中，和争取巩固世界和平的斗争中获得新的成就。
    我们热烈地祝贺统一社会党第三届代表大会成功。这一次代表大会要在创造统一、民主、爱好和平的德国的事业中起重要的作用。”
    联共中央的贺词被淹没在暴风雨般的热烈掌声中。
    在主席团的建议之下，大会以极大的热情通过了向斯大林致敬的电文。电文在对斯大林对德国人民始终如一的帮助表示感谢之后称：“为了完成其在争取和平、民主及社会主义的斗争中作为德国人民的先锋队的使命，德国统一社会党必须变成以列宁——斯大林党为榜样的新型的党。为达到这一步，首先必须精通马列主义并学习苏联共产党的经验。”
