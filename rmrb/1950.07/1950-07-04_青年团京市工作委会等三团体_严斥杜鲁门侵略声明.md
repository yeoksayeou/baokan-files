Beijing News Agency dispatch:

The Beijing Municipal Work Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and the Beijing Municipal Student Union, three youth organizations, issued a statement on June 30, sternly refuting President Truman's absurd statement of June 27. The statement of the three youth organizations is as follows:

"We, the youth of Beijing, are extremely indignant at President Truman's statement of June 27. The US government's order for the Seventh Fleet to move towards the Taiwan coast to prevent us from liberating Taiwan is an act of armed aggression by US imperialism against Chinese territory, further exposing its aggressive nature. US imperialism is panicked and embarrassed under the blows of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and in the face of the victory of the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of the world, fully demonstrating its outward strength and inner weakness. This crazy behavior of US imperialists can never stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and the liberation of the oppressed nations of the East. We, the youth of Beijing, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and will not be threatened or intimidated by US imperialism in any way. We resolutely oppose the armed aggression of US imperialists, unite as one to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, and fight to defend lasting world peace and people's democracy!"

　　青年团京市工作委会等三团体
    严斥杜鲁门侵略声明
    【京市新闻处讯】新民主主义青年团北京市工作委员会，北京市民主青年联合会筹备会及北京市学生联合会等三个青年团体，六月三十日发表声明，对美总统杜鲁门六月二十七日的荒谬声明，予以严正的驳斥。三个青年团体的声明如下：
    “对于美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明，我们北京青年万分愤慨。美国政府命令第七舰队向台湾沿海出动，阻止我解放台湾，这是美帝国主义对中国领土的武装侵略行为，更进一步暴露其侵略的本质，美帝国主义在中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的打击之下，在中国人民、朝鲜人民及全世界人民的胜利之下惊慌狼狈，充分表现它的外强中干。美帝国主义者这种疯狂行为，绝对不能阻止我们中国人民解放台湾，及东方各被压迫民族的解放，我们北京青年坚决拥护周外长的声明，不受美帝国主义的任何威胁恫吓，坚决反对美帝国主义者的武装侵略，团结一致为解放台湾而斗争，为保卫世界持久和平与人民民主而斗争！”
