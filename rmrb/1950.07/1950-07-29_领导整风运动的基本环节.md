　　The nationwide rectification movement has gradually unfolded. Party organizations in various large administrative regions and most provinces and cities, as well as in the People's Liberation Army, are currently formulating plans and beginning this large-scale rectification movement, following the Party Central Committee's instructions on Party rectification.

　　How should this rectification movement be led? This is a matter on which the Party's high-level leadership organs have reached a consensus and a clear understanding. However, among all Party cadres, it cannot be said that this problem has been completely resolved. The situation reflected from various places shows that the rectification movement has started relatively smoothly wherever the leading organs and leading cadres have correctly resolved this problem. Conversely, the rectification movement has taken or will take some detours wherever the leading organs and leading cadres have not resolved this problem, or have not resolved it well enough.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong clearly stated in his report to the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "The whole Party should, in the summer, autumn, and winter seasons of 1950, carry out a large-scale rectification movement in close combination with, and not separated from, various work tasks. By reading several designated documents, summarizing work, analyzing situations, and launching criticism and self-criticism, we should raise the ideological and political level of cadres and ordinary Party members, overcome errors in our work, overcome the arrogance and complacency of those who consider themselves meritorious, overcome bureaucracy and commandism, and improve the relationship between the Party and the people."

　　That is to say, the leading organs and their cadres at all levels of the Party should firmly grasp this basic link, which is to closely integrate the rectification movement with various work tasks. Any rectification that is divorced from practical work will be fruitless or will not yield good results.

　　Our Party has never advocated rectification that is divorced from reality. The two rectification movements that our Party has experienced in the past were both carried out according to the environment and tasks at the time. The first rectification movement, from 1942 to 1943, took place during the most difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, the dogmatic and liberal tendencies within the Party seriously hindered the implementation of the Party's correct line and policies, and hindered the Party's leadership in overcoming difficulties and completing the task of thoroughly defeating the enemy. The rectification movement at that time was proposed based on this environment and this task. The second rectification movement, from 1947 to 1948, took place during the most intense period of the War of Liberation, when the broad masses of peasants demanded the thorough implementation of land reform. However, some landlords and rich peasants who had infiltrated the Party, and some Party members who maintained ties with landlords and rich peasants, seriously resisted land reform, and many cadres in rural grassroots organizations were seriously divorced from the masses. These serious phenomena, at that time, greatly hindered the victorious advance of the People's Liberation War. The rectification movement at that time was closely integrated with this environment and this task. Precisely because of this, the past two rectification movements greatly improved the Party's ideological and political level, and the Party's work also made great progress as a result. Its main result lies in its great achievements. This has made a significant contribution to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation led by our Party.

　　Now, we are in an environment where the people's great revolution has achieved rapid victory throughout the country, and our Party is leading the entire people of the People's Republic of China in striving to achieve a fundamental turn for the better in the nation's financial and economic situation, starting from initial improvement. The various work tasks facing our entire Party and the people of the whole country are extremely arduous. Moreover, the nature of all tasks is different. Especially now that we have large cities and large industries across the country, the scientific division of labor is becoming increasingly strict, and the differences in the nature of various jobs are becoming more and more obvious. Under such complex work conditions and with such heavy work tasks, it is completely unimaginable to rectify the ideology and work style of cadres and Party members if we are divorced from the actual content of the various tasks they are participating in.

　　Most regions and units have already grasped the basic link of focusing on checking and summarizing work in the current rectification movement, making the study of documents a weapon for checking and summarizing work. This is correct. However, some regions and individual units are only abstractly checking the ideology and work style of Party members and cadres based on documents in the rectification, turning the rectification into empty slogans divorced from practice, and even randomly labeling people with the labels of "bureaucracy" or "commandism," while in reality, cadres are confused. This is of no benefit to practical work, and the ideological and political level of Party members and cadres will not be raised as a result. Because any ideological work style is not abstract, but is manifested in various practical works. Therefore, the main method of leading the rectification movement should be to check and summarize work.

　　It has been almost a year since the basic end of the Liberation War on the mainland of China. The newest liberated areas have also been working for nearly a year. At this time, it is necessary to conduct a systematic check and summary of various tasks. Only in the process of checking and summarizing work can we more clearly see the great achievements of various tasks and the shortcomings and errors that accompany them; can we systematically put forward good work experiences, carry forward the advantages, and systematically correct shortcomings and errors, so that the ideological level, political level, and work ability of cadres and Party members can be improved, and the work can be advanced.

　　However, what should we base on to check and summarize our various tasks? First of all, it is Comrade Mao Zedong's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. In this extremely rich and extremely concise historical report, Comrade Mao Zedong has made extremely important summaries and instructions on various tasks. This is the guideline for all our work in the current period. Therefore, it will inevitably become the guideline for the leading organs of the Party at all levels and every cadre and Party member to check and summarize their own work in the rectification movement. Of course, all communists and cadres must also check their own thoughts and work style at any time and any place in accordance with the Party Constitution and Party Program; the leading organs of the Party at all levels should also evaluate the merits and demerits, right and wrong of cadres and Party members in accordance with the Party Constitution and Party Program. Everything should be done in accordance with the Party Constitution.

　　From the perspective of the people's government's work system, the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the reports and resolutions of the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, as well as the Land Reform Law and other important laws and regulations promulgated by the Central People's Government, are fundamental standards that must be followed in the work of both communist and non-communist cadres and used to measure the quality of work. Communist cadres must become the most resolute implementers and models of the Common Program. Comrade Liu Shaoqi affirmed in his speech at the First Session of the CPPCC: "The Communist Party of China must support the CPPCC and strive to realize its Common Program because this Common Program includes the entire minimum program of the Communist Party. The current policy of the Communist Party is to fully realize its minimum program. Since this minimum program has been fully accepted by the CPPCC, it is only natural for the Communist Party of China to support the CPPCC and strive to realize its Common Program." Therefore, all localities should universally check and summarize policy thinking and work style according to the standards of the Common Program in the rectification movement. The reason why certain deviations in current work must be corrected is that they violate or are not suitable for the Common Program and do not conform to the highest interests of the Chinese people at this stage.

　　As long as we check and summarize work according to the policies and programs of the Party and the People's Government, and closely integrate the rectification movement with various tasks, the content of the rectification will be rich and vivid. The advantages and achievements, shortcomings and errors in the work that are checked in this way will be relevant. To overcome bureaucracy and commandism in this way is concrete and powerful, rather than empty and formal. This will be of more direct benefit to the improvement of our various tasks.

　　The purpose of checking and summarizing work is not to settle old scores, but to improve our work by checking and summarizing past work. Therefore, we should not only prevent and oppose empty talk that has no connection with practical work, and oppose trivial and purely technical checks, but also oppose aimlessly settling unnecessary and fruitless old scores. We should concentrate our efforts on checking and summarizing the current tasks and some important past issues that are directly related to the current tasks, in order to actively improve the work. When checking the work, we should analyze the situation realistically and clarify the right and wrong. As long as we find out what is correct and what is wrong in the work, the good and bad, right and wrong of some typical events and figures will also be incidentally determined.

　　In order to ensure the smooth progress of this rectification movement and to overcome the possible deviations in time, the leading organs of the Party at all levels should first take the initiative to check and summarize their own work, from their own leadership thinking and work style; then gradually deepen from top to bottom, in coordination with the check and summary from bottom to top. The heads of each unit should personally take action and lead the rectification movement in a planned and prepared manner under the conditions of close combination with the current tasks.

　　It can be believed that with the experience of the past two rectifications, and with the correct guidelines of the Party Central Committee, as long as all localities grasp the basic link of closely integrating the rectification with practical work, we will definitely be able to successfully complete the task of Party rectification in the summer, autumn and winter seasons of this year, so as to guarantee the implementation of land reform in the vast newly liberated areas, implement reasonable adjustments of industry and commerce throughout the country, rapidly improve various tasks, unite the people of the whole country, and strive for a fundamental turn for the better in the overall financial and economic situation of the country.

### 领导整风运动的基本环节

　　领导整风运动的基本环节
    全国性的整风运动已经逐步展开了。各个大行政区和多数盛市及人民解放军中党的组织，目前都在按照党中央所发出的关于整党的指示，先后制定计划，开始进行这个大规模的整风运动。
    应该怎样领导这一次的整风运动呢？这在党的高级领导机关来说，认识是一致的，明确的；但在全党干部的认识上来说，就还不能说已经完全解决。从各地所反映的情况中就可以看到：凡是领导机关和领导干部正确地解决了这个问题，那里的整风运动就比较顺利地开始了；反之，凡是领导机关和领导干部没有解决这个问题，或者解决得还不够好，那里的整风运动就走了或将要走一些弯路。
    毛泽东同志在三中全会的报告中讲得很清楚：“全党应在一九五零年的夏秋冬三季，在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离的条件下，进行一次大规模的整风运动。用阅读若干指定文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评和自我批评等项方法，提高干部和一般党员的思想水平和政治水平，克服工作中所犯的错误，克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪，克服官僚主义和命令主义，改善党与人民的关系。”
    这就是说，各级党的领导机关及其干部应该紧紧地掌握这样的一个基本环节，就是要把整风运动和各项工作任务密切地结合起来。一切离开实际工作的整风都将是没有结果或者不会有好的结果的。
    我们党从来也没有提倡过脱离实际的整风。我们党在过去所经历的两次整风运动都是根据当时的环境和任务来进行的。一九四二年到一九四三年的第一次整风运动，所处的环境是抗日战争相持阶段的最困难时期。而当时党内的教条主义倾向和自由主义倾向却严重地妨碍着党的正确路线和政策的贯彻执行，妨碍着党领导人民克服困难去完成彻底战胜敌人的任务。当时的整风运动就是根据这种环境和这种任务而提出的。一九四七年到一九四八年的第二次整风运动，所处的环境是解放战争最紧张的时期，广大农民要求彻底实行土地改革。而一些混入党内的地主富农分子和某些与地主富农保持联系的党员却严重地抵抗土地改革，农村基层组织中的许多干部严重地脱离群众。这些严重的现象，在当时，极大地妨碍了人民解放战争的胜利前进。当时的整风运动就是与这种环境和这种任务密切结合的。正因为如此，过去两次整风运动都使党的思想水平和政治水平大大提高了一步，党的工作也因此大大前进了一步。它的主要结果是在于它的伟大成绩方面。这对于我们党所领导的中国人民解放事业是有重大贡献的。
    现在我们所处的环境是人民大革命在全国得到迅速的胜利，我们党正领导着中华人民共和国的全体人民为争取国家财政经济状况从开始好转走向基本好转而斗争。摆在我们全党和全国人民面前的各项工作任务是十分艰巨的。而所有的各项工作，性质又是各不相同的。特别是在我们有了全国的大城市和大工业的条件下，科学的分工日益严密，因而各种工作性质的不同也就愈加明显。在工作性质这样复杂、工作任务这样繁重的情况之下，要整顿干部党员的思想作风，如果离开他们所参加的各项工作的实际内容，就完全是不可想像的了。
    多数地区和单位，目前在整风运动中已经抓住了以检查与总结工作为主的这样一个基本环节，使文件学习成为检查与总结工作的武器，这是正确的。但是，也有部分地区和个别单位，在整风中只是抽象地从文件出发来检查党员干部的思想作风，把整风变成了脱离实践的空喊，甚至把“官僚主义”或“命令主义”的帽子乱戴或乱扣了一气，而实际上干部却莫明其妙。这对于实际工作是没有什么益处的，干部党员的思想水平和政治水平并不会因此而提高。因为任何思想作风都不是抽象的，而是从各项实际工作中表现出来的。因此领导整风运动的主要方法应该是检查与总结工作。
    我国大陆解放战争基本结束将近一年了。解放最晚的新区也经过了将近一年的工作。这时候，对各项工作进行一个系统的检查和总结，是必需的。只有在检查与总结工作中，才能更清楚地看到各项工作的伟大成绩和伴随着成绩而来的缺点和错误的所在；才能系统地提出好的工作经验，发扬优点，并系统地改正缺点和错误，使干部党员的思想水平、政治水平和工作能力提高一步，使工作前进一步。
    但是，要根据什么来检查与总结我们的各项工作呢？这，首先就是毛泽东同志在党的三中全会上的报告。毛泽东同志在这个极其丰富又极其简明的历史性的报告中，对于各项工作已做了极重要的总结和指示。这是我们在目前时期一切工作的指针。因此，这也就必然要成为各级党的领导机关和每个干部党员在整风运动中检查与总结自己工作的指针。当然，所有的共产党员和干部，还必须随时随地按照党纲党章来检查自己的思想和作风；各级党的领导机关也应该按照党纲党章来评定干部党员的功过和是非。一切都应该按照党章来办。
    从人民政权工作的系统来说，中国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领和最近政协全国委员会第二次会议中的报告及决议，经中央人民政府颁布的土地改革法等重要法令，无论对于共产党员或非共产党员的干部，都是工作中所必须遵循的并用以衡量工作好坏的根本标准。而共产党员干部更要成为共同纲领的最坚决的执行者和模范。刘少奇同志在人民政协第一届会议上的讲话，就曾肯定地指出：“中国共产党要拥护人民政治协商会议并为实现它的共同纲领而奋斗，是因为这个共同纲领包括了共产党的全部最低纲领。共产党的当前政策，就是要全部实现自己的最低纲领。这个最低纲领，既已全部为人民政治协商会议所接受，因此，中国共产党拥护人民政治协商会议并为实现它的共同纲领而奋斗，乃是当然的事情。”因此，各地在整风运动中应该普遍地按照共同纲领的标准，来检查与总结政策思想和作风。目前各项工作中的某些偏向所以必须纠正，就是因为它违背了或者不适合于共同纲领，不符合于现阶段中国人民的最高利益。
    只要根据党和人民政府的政策纲领来检查与总结工作，把整风运动与各项工作密切结合，这样整风的内容就会是丰富的和生动的。这样检查出来的工作中的优点和成绩、缺点和错误才是切中要害的。这样来克服官僚主义和命令主义才是具体的有力的，而不是空洞的形式的。这样对于我们各项工作的改进更会有直接的益处。
    检查与总结工作的目的，不是为了算旧账，而是在于从检查与总结过去的工作中，改进我们的工作。因此，不但应该防止与反对那种与实际工作毫无联系的空谈，反对琐碎的单纯技术性的检查，也要反对无目的地去清算那些不必要的因而亦无结果的旧账。我们应该集中力量来检查与总结当前的各项工作及与当前工作有直接关系的过去若干重要的问题，以求积极改进工作。检查工作的时候，应该实事求是地分析情况，弄清是非。只要从工作中找出那些是正确的和那些是错误的，那末，对于其中若干典型的事件和人物的好坏是非，同时也就会附带判明了。
    为了使这一次的整风运动能够顺利进行，及时克服可能发生的偏向，各级党的领导机关应就自己管辖内的工作，从自己的领导思想和作风方面，首先主动地进行检查与总结；然后自上而下地逐级深入，配合自下而上的检查与总结。各单位首长应亲自动手，在与当前各项工作密切结合的条件下，有计划、有准备地去领导整风运动。
    可以相信，我们党有了过去两次整风的经验，有了党中央的正确方针，只要各地掌握整风和实际工作密切结合的这个基本环节，我们就一定能够在今年夏秋冬三季，顺利完成全党整风的任务，以便有保证地实行广大新解放区的土地改革，在全国各地实行工商业的合理调整，迅速改进各项工作，团结全国人民，争取国家整个财政经济状况的根本好转。
