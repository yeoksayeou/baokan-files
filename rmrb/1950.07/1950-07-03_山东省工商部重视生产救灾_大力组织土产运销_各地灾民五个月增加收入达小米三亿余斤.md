Shandong Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce Emphasizes Production for Disaster Relief
    Vigorously Organizes the Transport and Sale of Native Products
    Income of Disaster Victims in Various Regions Increases by Over 300 Million Jin of Millet in Five Months

[Report from Jinan by this newspaper] Under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce, trade companies in various regions have been assisting rural side-line occupations and handicraft production in disaster areas, achieving great results in the first five months of this year.

    Widely Organizes Grain Consignment Sales to Guarantee Stable Grain Prices in Disaster Areas

Since January, trade companies in various regions have begun to pay attention to integrating production with disaster relief. For example, the Lunan, Shandong and Jiaodong district companies, in order to stabilize prices in disaster areas, promptly and widely supply the needs of disaster victims, and conduct internal sales adjustments of native products, vigorously organized cooperatives and trust departments to widely carry out consignment sales and retail business for their subordinate branches in the sales of supplies. For example, Xinpu branch organized twelve cooperatives and twenty consignment stores, and increased working hours. Tai'an branch organized 165 cooperatives and organized more than 20 groups of poor cooperative members to go to rural fairs, opening up more than 180 markets in six counties in western Tai'an. Jiaodong Xihai branch organized more than 60 cooperatives to sell grain on consignment. In this way, the masses in the disaster areas were supplied with food and other items at reasonable prices in a widespread and powerful manner. Qingdao Trading Company also planned to exchange a batch of food with other ports, allocating 500,000 jin of soybeans to the West, South Sea, and Binbei areas respectively, and 2.5 million jin of sorghum to Xihai and Binbei for adjustment. In the above sales, due to the clear and emphasis on the purpose of combining sales with disaster relief in the minds of cadres, it played a great role in ensuring that disaster victims overcame the famine. In addition, the central government allocated 29 million jin of grain to the province from Northeast China and Henan, which was planned to be transported to disaster areas and small and medium-sized cities from January to ensure the supply of grain and the stability of grain prices in disaster areas.

    Assists Disaster Victims in Completing Wheat Harvest, Widely Carries Out Exchange of Coarse Grains for Fine Grains

In order to support disaster victims through the severe juncture of the pre-wheat harvest period, the Central Trade Department approved the allocation of 85 million jin of autumn grain (including corn and sorghum from the Northeast) to disaster victims for lending, in exchange for wheat, cotton, hemp, vermicelli and other side-line products. The provincial grain company has now loaned out this grain in installments. The first phase, from mid-May to the end of May, plans to distribute 15 million jin (in exchange for wheat), allocated to areas such as Lunan, Shandong, Xuzhou, and Jiaodong. By the end of May, in addition to completing all loans, another 4 million jin had been loaned out within the quantity planned for the next phase, totaling 19 million jin loaned out. The original plan for the second phase was 70 million jin. In addition to the 4 million jin loaned out earlier, there are still 66 million jin remaining. It is planned to allocate 20 million jin to the native products company for exchange of native products; 20 million jin to the cotton yarn and cloth company for exchange of cotton; and the remaining 26 million jin to the provincial grain company, which has been distributed to its subordinate disaster areas in Jinan, Xuzhou, Qingdao, Yantai, Xinpu, Weixian, and Dezhou respectively, and plans to loan out (including native products, cotton yarn and cloth) by the end of June. However, the loan of this batch of grain was too late, and the original plan was for 55 million jin of grain to be allocated from the Northeast, with half scheduled to arrive before May 15 and the remainder to be fully transported by the end of June. However, by mid-June, the Northeast had only transported 12 million jin of corn. To this end, the department specifically instructed the provincial grain company to send personnel to contact the China National Grain Corporation to urge expedited transportation. At the same time, in order not to miss the opportunity, before the grain from the Northeast arrived, the grain company first organized a batch of loans from its existing grain.

    Organizes Disaster Victims to Participate in Transportation, Sea Ports and Inland Areas Exchange

In addition, considerable achievements have also been made in organizing disaster-stricken masses to transport goods in conjunction with production and disaster relief.

    In the past five months, a total of 66.43 million jin of peanuts were transported from rural areas to cities and seaports, a total of 51 million jin of grain was transferred from cities and seaports to inland disaster areas, a total of 24,276,300 jin of cotton was transported from rural areas to railway lines, Lunan Shandong district company transported a total of 25,230,249 jin of grain, crude oil, cotton, coal, salt, and by-products, etc., coal company transported 835 tons of coal and unloaded 1,268 tons of coal. The masses participating in the above transportation activities received freight equivalent to 21,260,780 jin of autumn grain.

    Supports Side-line Occupations, Purchases Native Products, Income of Farmers in Disaster Areas Increases

In terms of supporting the side-line production of the masses, in addition to entrusting the masses in Jiaodong, Lunan, Shandong, Bohai, Qingdao, Yantai and other places to process oil with a large amount of raw rice and cottonseed, cash was also used to purchase eggs, pig bristles, vermicelli, peppers, mountain fruits, embroidery, lace, wool, seafood and other side-line products in various places, and hemp bags from Weifang Disaster Victims Cooperative; The native products company also plans to purchase 2 million jin of silkworm cocoons in Shandong on behalf of China Silkworm Company, and has paid 3.3 billion yuan in RMB. In the above-mentioned support for the side-line production of the masses, processing fees equivalent to more than 5,383,500 jin of autumn grain were paid out, and the direct purchase amounted to 1,176,000 jin of autumn grain and more than 90 billion yuan in RMB.

    Rewards the Export of Minor Native Products to Increase the Country's Foreign Exchange Income

In order to overcome the disaster and cooperate with the development of foreign trade and expand exports, in addition to vigorously organizing exports in various regions, during the more serious disaster period in February, in order to prevent the outflow of food and reduce the degree of domestic food shortage, emergency measures were taken to prohibit the export of raw cakes and bean cakes for the masses to mix with vegetables. Now, because new wheat has been successively put on the market, the disaster has been basically overcome. In order to earn foreign exchange, it has been reported to the higher authorities for approval and changed to a special export permit. While rewarding the export of minor native products, trade departments in various regions also organized cooperatives and private merchants to purchase in the interior, and encouraged private merchants to export. In terms of management, in addition to resolutely implementing the central government's policy of settling foreign exchange for all export goods, and in accordance with Shandong's disaster situation and the actual situation of foreign trade, the export of some minor native products such as: embroidery, lace, straw braid, mountain fruits, vegetables, seafood and other materials are allowed, and the method of barter trade is adopted. This is not only beneficial to exporters, but more importantly, it enables the by-products produced by farmers to have a sales channel, which increases the purchasing power of farmers. From January to mid-May, a total of $3,387,928.93 was exchanged for the export of minor native products and by-products. In addition to the trade department's in-depth approach to rural areas to provide the needs of disaster victims in a timely manner, the surplus obtained by the masses in transportation and sales of native products can also be converted into 315,214,329 jin. This played a great supporting role in helping disaster victims overcome the spring famine.

　　山东省工商部重视生产救灾
    大力组织土产运销
    各地灾民五个月增加收入达小米三亿余斤
    【本报济南讯】山东省各地贸易公司，在省工商部领导下，扶助灾区农村副业及手工业生产，今年头五个月里已有很大成绩。
    广泛组织粮食代销  保证灾区粮价平稳
    从一月份起各地贸易公司即开始注意结合生产救灾。如鲁中南、胶东区公司对所属分公司在出售物资中，为了使灾区的物价稳定并及时地广泛地供给灾民所需，以及进行土产品的内销调剂，曾大力组织了合作社、信托部广泛开展委托代售和零售业务。如新浦分公司即组织了十二个合作社和二十个代销店，并增加了工作时间。泰安分公司组织一百六十五个合作社，并组织贫苦社员二十余组下乡赶集，在泰西六个县即开辟了一百八十余处市场，胶东西海分公司组织合作社代销粮食的就有六十余处。这样广泛有力地以合理价格供应了灾区群众食粮及其他物品。青岛贸易公司亦有计划地与外埠交换一批食粮，分别拨到西、南海及滨北等地大豆各五十万斤，拨到西海、滨北高粱二百五十万斤，以作调剂。在以上出售中，由于干部思想上明确和重视了出售与救灾结合的目的，故对保证灾民度过灾荒起了很大作用。另外中央由东北、河南拨给该省的粮食二千九百万斤，从一月份开始即有计划地分别运至灾区及中小城市，保证了灾区粮食的供应及粮价的稳定。
    扶助灾民完成麦收  广泛进行以粗换细
    为扶持灾民度过麦收前青黄不接的严重关头，中央贸易部又批准拨给秋粮（包括东北的苞米、高粱）八千五百万斤贷给灾民，交换小麦、棉、麻、粉丝及其他副业产品。现已由省粮食公司分期贷放。第一期由五月中旬起至五月底计划放完一千五百万斤（交换小麦），分配在鲁中南、徐州、胶东等区。到五月底，除全数贷放完毕外，又在下期计划的数量内贷出四百万斤，总计贷出一千九百万斤。第二期原计划为七千万斤。除提早已贷出四百万斤外，尚余六千六百万斤。计分配给土产公司二千万斤，交换土产品；花纱布公司二千万斤，交换棉花；省粮食公司尚余二千六百万斤，已分别分配在济南、徐州、青岛、烟台、新浦、潍县、德州等分公司直接布置至各所属灾区，并计划（土产花纱布在内）于六月底贷完。惟此次贷粮在时间上太晚，且原计划该批贷粮，由东北拨给五千五百万斤，确定五月十五日前运到一半，其余在六月底前全部运齐。但至六月中旬东北却只运到苞米一千二百万斤，为此，该部特责成省粮食公司派员去中国粮食总公司联系，督促速为调运。同时，为不失时机，在东北粮食未运到前，将粮食公司现存之粮食先行组织贷放一批。
    组织灾民参加运输  海口与内地相交流
    另外，在结合生产救灾组织灾民群众运输方面亦做出不少成绩。
    五个月来由农村运到城市及海口花生米计六、六四三万斤，由城市及海口向内地灾区调运粮食计五千一百万斤，由农村运至铁路沿线棉花计二四、二七六、三○○斤，鲁中南区公司调运粮食、生油、棉花、煤炭、盐、副产品等类共计二五、二三○、二四九斤，煤炭公司运煤八三五吨、卸煤一、二六八吨，以上参加各项运输的群众共得运费合秋粮二一、二六○、七八○斤。
     扶植副业收购土产  灾区农民收入增加
    在扶持群众副业生产方面，除在胶东、鲁中南、渤海、青岛、烟台等地以大量生米、籽棉委托群众打油加工外，并以现款在各地收购鸡蛋、猪鬃、粉丝、大椒、山果、绣花、花边、羊毛、海产等副业产品，及潍坊灾民合作社的麻袋；土产公司又代中蚕公司计划在山东收购蚕茧二百万斤，已付人民币三十三亿元。以上各项在扶持群众副业生产中，共付出加工费合秋粮五、三八三、五○○余斤，直接收购方面计付出秋粮一、一七六、○○○斤，人民币九百亿余元。
    奖励次要土产出口  增加国家外汇收入
    又为了战胜灾荒，配合发展对外贸易、扩大输出，各地除大力组织出口外，在二月份灾荒较严重时期，为了防止食粮外流，减少国内的粮荒程度，曾对生饼、豆饼采取了禁止出口的紧急措施，以备群众掺菜食用。现因新麦陆续登场，灾荒已基本上克服。为争取外汇，已呈报上级批准，改为特许出口。与奖励次要土产品出口的同时，各地贸易部门在内地亦组织合作社与私商进行收购，并鼓励私商输出。在管理上，除坚决执行中央关于出口物资一律结汇的方针外，又根据山东的灾荒情况及对外贸易的实际情况，允许部分的次要土产如：绣花、花边、草帽辫、山果、蔬菜、海产等类物资出口，采取易货办法。这样不仅有利于出口商，而且更主要的是使农民生产的副产品因而有了销路，提高了农民的购买力。总计一至五月中旬，出口次要土产品和副产品，共计换取外汇三、三八七、九二八·九三美元。除贸易上深入农村适时供应了灾民的需要外，群众运输和销售土产所得余额尚能折合三一五、二一四、三二九斤。这对灾民度过春荒起着极大的支持作用。
