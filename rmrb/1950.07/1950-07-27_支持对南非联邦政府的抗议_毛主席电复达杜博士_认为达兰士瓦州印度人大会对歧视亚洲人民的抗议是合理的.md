Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Joseph Dadoo, chairman of the Transvaal Indian Congress of the Union of South Africa, cabled Chairman Mao Zedong on June 18, appealing to our government to support their protest against the so-called "apartheid laws" of the government of the Union of South Africa. Chairman Mao Zedong has replied by telegram expressing full support. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:

(I) Telegram from Joseph Dadoo to Chairman Mao: Chairman of the People's Government of China

Due to the South African government's fierce violation of the rights of Asian peoples based on the "apartheid laws," which directly affect overseas Chinese groups and the Indian people, the Transvaal Indian Congress, in view of the important position historically given to China in Asian and world affairs, hereby appeals to your government to actively participate in the worldwide protest against South African fascism.
                      Chairman: Dr. Joseph Dadoo
                    June 18

(II) Chairman Mao's Reply: To Dr. Joseph Dadoo, Chairman of the Transvaal Indian Congress of South Africa:

Telegram of June 18 received.

I, on behalf of the Chinese people, fully support your just protest against the so-called "apartheid laws" of the government of the Union of South Africa, which discriminate against Chinese, Indian, and other Asian peoples.
                Mao Zedong, Beijing, July 26

Note: The so-called "apartheid laws" proposed by the government of the Union of South Africa were passed by the South African Parliament in June. This law is a further development of South Africa's consistent policy of excluding Asians and racial discrimination over the past sixty years. The law confines non-white people, who account for more than two-thirds of the population of the Union of South Africa, to several segregated areas. The so-called non-white people refer to South African natives, Indians, and a small number of Chinese (the total number of South African natives is about nine million, Indians about 300,000, overseas Chinese about 4,000, and white people less than two million). This reactionary law has aroused unanimous and fierce opposition and protest from people of all ethnic groups in South Africa.

　　支持对南非联邦政府的抗议
    毛主席电复达杜博士
    认为达兰士瓦州印度人大会对歧视亚洲人民的抗议是合理的
    【新华社二十六日讯】南非联邦达兰士瓦州印度人大会主席约瑟夫·达杜于六月十八日致电毛泽东主席，呼吁我国政府支持其抗议南非联邦政府的所谓“种族隔离法案”。毛泽东主席已电复表示完全支持。两电电文如下：
    （一）约瑟夫·达杜致毛主席电：中国人民政府主席
    由于南非政府根据“种族隔离法案”猛烈侵犯亚洲人民，该法案并直接影响到华侨团体以及印度人民，达兰士瓦州印度人大会鉴于历史赋与中国在亚洲及世界事务中的重要地位，特向贵政府呼吁请求积极参加全世界对南非联邦法西斯主义之抗议。
                      主席：约瑟夫·达杜博士
                    六月十八日
    （二）毛主席复电：南非达兰士瓦州印度人大会主席约瑟夫·达杜博士：
    六月十八日来电收到。
    我代表中国人民完全支持你们对于南非联邦政府歧视中、印及其他亚洲人民的所谓“种族隔离法案”的合理的抗议。
                毛泽东  北京七月二十六日
    按：南非联邦政府提出的所谓“种族隔离法案”已于六月间在南非议会通过。这一个法案是南非六十余年来一贯排斥亚洲人和种族歧视政策的进一步发展。该法案把占南非联邦人口三分之二以上的非白种人，禁锢于几个隔离的地区以内。所谓非白种人，系指南非土人、印度人，少数中国人亦包括在内（南非土人总数约为九百万，印度人约三十万，华侨约四千，白种人不到二百万）。这一反动法案已引起南非各族人民的一致激烈反对与抗议。
