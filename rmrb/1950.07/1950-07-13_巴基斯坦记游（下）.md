A Trip to Pakistan (Part 2)
By Geladekefu, Translated by Gong Qiren

        IV. Two and a Half Years After Partition

When India was divided in 1947 into two dominions of the British Empire – the Indian Federation and Pakistan – the latter was formed by the merger of several provinces and princely states. Pakistan had an area of approximately 361,000 square miles and a population of about 75 million, of whom nearly three-quarters were Muslims. The dominion was divided into two parts—West Pakistan, comprising the bulk of the territory, and East Pakistan (East Bengal), about 1,500 kilometers away.

The facts of the two and a half years since partition have amply demonstrated that the division was not due to religious differences among the population, as the British newspapers have taken pains to prove. The British colonialists divided India because they realized that they could no longer rule India in the old way; and the religious differences and Indo-Pakistani disputes that the British authorities often tried to provoke were merely official excuses. Britain divided India and thus created two dominions that were at daggers drawn but economically interdependent, and its policy was to stir up strife between them.

But what have been the economic consequences of partition? Pakistan is an agricultural country with no industry to speak of except for a few small cotton mills, oil presses, cement plants, metallurgical plants and repair shops. It mainly produces textile raw materials – cotton and jute. The average annual cotton harvest is about one million bales. Jute production in East Bengal accounts for more than 75 percent of the world's total production.

On the other hand, all industries remained in India, which routinely imported 400,000 to 450,000 bales of cotton and more than two-thirds of the total jute harvest from what is now so-called Pakistan each year. Thus, cotton and jute growers in Pakistan are dependent on the Indian market. Also, Pakistan routinely imports coal, textiles and other important commodities from India. Partition has had unfortunate economic consequences in both countries, and Anglo-American monopolists have taken advantage of this fact to hold both economies in their clutches.

Currently, Indo-Pakistani relations are extremely strained. There are four points of contention: the Kashmir issue; the property issue of refugees from India and Pakistan stranded in each other's territories; the water allocation issue of rivers flowing from East Punjab Province to West Punjab Province; and finally, friction between the two countries caused by the devaluation of the pound sterling.

The imperialists have invoked invisible magic weapons to thwart the resolution of these disputes and exacerbate hatred between the two dominions.

Of the four disputes between India and Pakistan, the first and fourth have caused the two countries more suffering.

Kashmir, a large state in the northern part of the peninsula with an area of 84,000 square miles and a population of approximately four million, is claimed by both India and Pakistan. India's claim to ownership is officially based on the decision of the Maharaja of Kashmir to join the Indian Federation. Pakistan's argument is that 80 percent of Kashmir's population is Muslim and that the state is of great strategic and economic importance to Pakistan. Strategically, it borders three-quarters of Pakistan's northern border; economically, Kashmir means control over the flow of water from the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers that irrigate Pakistan.

The dispute began more than two years ago and has involved armed conflict. The dispute has been brought to the United Nations more than once, but the prospect of a resolution is bleak because certain powerful members of the United Nations are secretly causing trouble.

For Britain, Kashmir is one of the tools to keep the two dominions under its control. The method she uses is extremely simple: by allowing support for one dominion in the Kashmir dispute, she forces it to agree to Britain's political and economic demands. At the same time, Britain is extorting the other dominion by claiming that if it does not agree to the demands, Britain will withdraw its support in the Kashmir dispute.

Another very important cause of friction between the two dominions has developed further due to the devaluation of the pound sterling. Pakistan is the only country in the sterling area that has not devalued its currency. The official explanation is that Pakistan exports raw materials that are urgently needed by the world market and that its trade has a large surplus. On the other hand, India's currency has been devalued, so its exchange rate has been changed to 144 Indian rupees equals 100 Pakistani rupees. The result has effectively brought trade between the two dominions to a standstill and has begun an economic struggle. Indian merchants and manufacturers are opposed to paying the extra 44 percent exchange rate to buy Pakistani goods and are demanding that the Pakistani rupee be lowered to the level of the Indian rupee. They have refused to buy Pakistani jute, cotton and other raw materials, thereby putting pressure on their government by Pakistani raw material producers who routinely sell large quantities of produce to India. At the same time, India has curbed the export of textiles, coal and other urgently needed goods to Pakistan.

The above situation has proven to be very harmful to both countries. But some people have found it extremely beneficial. While India and Pakistan are suffering heavy losses as a result, foreign capitalists are reaping their net profits. Earlier this year, the Pakistan Times published an article entitled "Britain Profits from Indo-Pakistani Trade War," which wrote that with the cessation of trade between Pakistan and India, British goods have invaded its market. For example, imports of various British cotton fabrics in 1949 were three times higher than in 1948.

The disputes between the two dominions are hindering economic and cultural progress on both sides.

Huge sums of money that could be used for industrial and agricultural development and the needs of education and health are being spent on military purposes. Pakistan's military expenditure for the 1949-50 fiscal year accounted for 50 percent of its national budget.

Being a dominion of the British Empire has not brought true independence to Pakistan. An agricultural country producing raw materials, it remains completely dependent on foreign markets and foreign capital.

The industrial development plan announced by the Pakistani government in April 1948 welcomed foreign capital to participate in the economic life of the dominion. Foreign businessmen appeared immediately. In the last three months of 1949, a delegation from the American steel capital group roamed the country and collected information from all sides as much as possible. At the end of 1949, four American senators spent nearly a week in Pakistan, where they were lavishly and comfortably entertained by local officials. These senators were accompanied by various experts to many places they were interested in. Like many Americans who visited Pakistan, they seemed particularly attracted to the northern region bordering the Soviet Union. They went to the Khyber Pass, studied the country in detail, and took local photographs.

American and British imperialists are trying to turn Pakistan into a military base. They supply it with weapons and control the training of its army. The commander-in-chief is a British officer, and almost all other senior military positions are filled by British people.

The Pakistani government's reactionary policy is completely in line with the intention of turning the country into an imperialist stronghold in the East. Pakistani democrats who pursue true national independence and oppose foreign capital are being hunted and persecuted. Imperialist agents are trying to fool the people's ignorance, superstition and religious fanaticism; only 5.3 percent of the population in Pakistan are literate. They are doing everything possible to deceive the Pakistani people and make them tools for the imperialists in their efforts to suppress the national liberation and democratic movements in the Middle East.

American and British newspapers, as well as Pakistani newspapers themselves, often say that there is no revolutionary movement in the country. Of course, in fact, Pakistan has no industry. The working class is small—only 30,000 people are employed in industry. Nevertheless, the ranks of those fighting for national independence, peace and democracy are growing, and mass political activity is steadily rising. In Pakistan, the working people are also increasingly understanding who is really fighting for peace and the happiness of the working people, and who is plotting wars and leading mankind to endless misfortune, hunger and poverty.

The echoes of the great events in China have also been heard in Pakistan. The victory of the Chinese people has aroused a resounding response.

Increasing numbers of progressive people are moving forward and establishing their own organizations. A progressive writers' association and a progressive journalists' alliance have been established. The first session of the Pakistan National Peace Congress, initiated by progressive writers, has been held.

The Pakistani people are learning more about the life and work of the victorious socialist motherland. This can be seen from the welcome given to Soviet guests by the Pakistan Writers' Conference. Thousands of people gathered to listen to the speeches of Soviet visitors. When the meeting ended, hundreds of people gathered around the Soviet representatives and applauded. Everywhere people shouted "Long live the friendship between the Pakistani and Soviet peoples!" and "Long live the Soviet Union!"

The mass movement in Pakistan is just beginning to develop. But the long-oppressed people here also yearn for freedom and are fighting for their social and economic rights.

　　巴基斯坦记游（下）
    格拉德可夫作  龚齐仁节译
            四、分治后的两年半
    当印度于一九四七年被划分为不列颠帝国的两个自治领——印度联邦和巴基斯坦——时，后者由许多省份与土邦并合而成。巴基斯坦拥有大约三十六万一千方英里的面积和七千五百万左右的人口，其中差不多有四分之三是回教徒。这个自治领被分割成了两部分——包括领土之绝大部分的西巴基斯坦和距离前者约一千五百公里的东巴基斯坦（东孟加拉）。
    分治后两年半以来的事实业已充分表明：分裂的原因并不是如同英国报纸所煞费苦心要去证明的那样，说是由于人口中之宗教差异。英国殖民者分裂印度的原因是由于他们认清了他们已经再也不能以老法子来统治印度了；而英国当局所经常竭力挑唆的宗教差异和印回之争只不过是官方的借口。英国分裂了印度，因之得以组成两个情同水火但经济上却是相互依存的自治领，而她的政策便是煽起两者间之纷争。
    但是，分治以来的经济后果是些什么呢？巴基斯坦是一个农业国，除却很少的几个小小的轧棉厂、榨油厂、士敏土厂、冶金厂和修配厂外没有任何工业可言。这儿主要地是出产纺织原料——棉花和苎麻。棉花平均每年收获量约一百万包。东孟加拉出产的苎麻占全世界总产量的百分之七十五以上。
    另一方面，一切工业都留在印度，那儿照例是每年要从现在的所谓巴基斯坦输入四十万至四十五万包棉花和占总收获量三分之二以上的苎麻。于是巴基斯坦的棉花和苎麻种植者就仰赖着印度的市场。还有，巴基斯坦例常要从印度输入煤、纺织品和他种重要的商品。分治在两个国家中都产生了经济上的不幸的后果，而英美独占资本家就趁机利用着这个事实把双方的经济扼制在他们的魔掌里。
    目前印巴关系极度紧张。争端计有四点：克什米尔问题；印巴两国流落对方境内之难民的财产问题；由东旁遮普省流向西旁遮普省的那些河流用水调配问题；最后，还有由英镑贬值而引起的两国间之磨擦。
    帝国主义者们祭起了无形的法宝来阻遏此等纷争之调解并且加重两个自治领间的仇恨。
    在印巴间的四桩争端中，尤以第一第四桩使印巴两国所遭受的苦害更甚。
    印巴两国都声言为其所有的克什米尔，是半岛北部的一个面积八万四千方英里，人口约四百万的大邦。印度所声言的所有权系正式基于克什米尔大君之决意加入印度联邦。巴基斯坦的论据是克什米尔的人口中有百分之八十是回教徒且该邦在战略上与经济上对巴基斯坦均极具重要性。论战略，它毗连着巴基斯坦的北部边陲的四分之三；以经济言，克什米尔又意味着对灌注巴基斯坦的印度河、吉拉姆河和奇诺布河诸河川的水流之控制。
    争执早在两年多以前便已开始了，而且其间还有过武装冲突。争执曾不止一次被提到联合国去，然而解决的前途却黯淡得很，这是因为某些有势力的联合国会员国在暗中捣乱的缘故。
    对英国说来，克什米尔是置两个自治领于其控制下的工具之一。她使用的手法极其简单：允许在克什米尔争执上对一自治领予以支持，借此使它不得不答应英国的政治的和经济的要求。同时，英国又以声言如不答应要求，英国即将撤回在克什米尔争执上的支持，来对另一自治领进行勒索。
    两个自治领间磨擦的另外一个很重要的原因由于英镑贬值而更发展了。巴基斯坦是英镑区中唯一的没有把货币贬值的国家。官方的解释是巴基斯坦输出世界市场所迫切需要的原料，而且她的贸易有很大的出超。另一方面，印度的货币贬值了，所以她的外汇比率改成一四四个印度卢比等于一○○个巴基斯坦卢比。其结果实际上已使得两个自治领间的贸易陷于停顿，并开始了一种经济上的斗争。印度商人和制造商们反对偿付那额外附加的百分之四十四的外汇比率去购买巴基斯坦的货物，并且要求巴基斯坦的卢比降低到印度的水平。他们已拒绝购买巴基斯坦的苎麻、棉花和其他原料，借此以使经常出售大批产物给印度的巴基斯坦原料生产者对他们的政府施以压力。同时，印度已遏止纺织品、煤，以及其他一些急切需要的货物输往巴基斯坦。
    上述的这种情况，已证明对两国都是非常有害的。但是有些人倒发现了那是极为有利的。当印度和巴基斯坦由此而遭受严重损失时，外国资本家却攫得了他们的净利。今年年初，巴基斯坦时报曾发表了一篇标题为“英国由印巴商战而得利”的文章，里边写道，随着巴基斯坦同印度的贸易之停止，英国的货物便侵入了她的市场。例如，一九四九年英国各种棉织品的入口量等于一九四八年的三倍。
    两个自治领间的争端阻碍了双方在经济与文化上的进步。
    能够用到工业和农业的发展以及教育和卫生的需要上的庞大的款项，正耗费于军事目的上。巴基斯坦一九四九至五○年度的军费开支占其国家预算的百分之五十。

    作为大英帝国的一个自治领并没有给巴基斯坦带来了真正的独立。一个农业的、出产原料的国家，它依然完全依赖于外国市场和外国资本。
    一九四八年四月里巴基斯坦政府宣布的工业发展计划，欢迎外国资本参与该自治领的经济生活。外国商人马上出现了。一九四九年末三个月中，美国钢铁资本集团派出的一个代表团漫游了该国，并尽可能地收集各方面的情报。一九四九年末，又有四位美国参议员在巴基斯坦费了将近一星期的时间，他们被当地官员奢华而舒适地招待。这几个参议员由各种专家伴随着到许多他们感兴趣的地方。和许多拜访巴基斯坦的美国人一样，他们似乎特别被接近于苏联边境的北部地区所吸引。他们到开伯尔山口，全面研究该国，并拍摄当地的照片。
    美英帝国主义者们企图将巴基斯坦变成一个军事基地。他们供给它武器并掌管其军队的训练。总司令是一个英国军官，其他所有高级军事职位几乎全由英国人充任。
    巴基斯坦政府的反动政策，和这一变该国为帝国主义在东方据点的意旨完全一致。追求真正民族独立和反对外国资本的巴基斯坦民主分子被追捕与迫害。帝国主义的代理人，企图愚弄人民的无知、迷信与宗教热狂；巴基斯坦识字的人只占人口的百分之五点三。他们尽一切方法欺骗巴基斯坦人民，使他们成为帝国主义者在压服中东的民族解放与民主运动的努力中的工具。
    英美的报纸，以及巴基斯坦的报纸本身，常常说该国没有革命运动。当然，事实上巴基斯坦没有工业。工人阶级人数很少——只有三万人受雇于工业中。虽然如此，为民族独立、和平与民主而斗争的队伍却在增大着，群众的政治活动也在稳步上升。在巴基斯坦，劳动人民也正日益明白谁真正为和平及劳动人民的幸福而斗争，谁策划战争并将人类引向无尽的不幸、饥饿和贫困。
    中国伟大事件的回声在巴基斯坦也听到了。中国人民的胜利唤起了响亮的反响。
    日益增多的进步人民在前进，并且建立了他们自己的组织。已经建立的有一个进步作家协会和一个进步记者联盟。由进步作家发起的巴基斯坦全国和平大会第一届大会已经举行了。
    巴基斯坦人民正在知道更多的关于胜利的社会主义伟大祖国的生活与工作。从巴基斯坦作家大会给予苏联客人的欢迎便可以看到了。几千人集会听取苏联访问者的演说。当集会结束时，成百的人们聚拢在苏联代表的周围鼓掌。到处高喊着“巴苏人民友好万岁！”，“苏联万岁！”
    巴基斯坦的群众运动刚在开展着。但是这里长久被压迫的人民也热望着自由，并为了他们的社会和经济权利而斗争。
