　　Comrade Li Han of Inner Mongolia Tannery Improves Production Tools and Increases Output
　　Comrade Li Han, head of the tanning section of the Zhangjiakou Inner Mongolia Tannery, has been diligently studying and improving production tools in the recent production competition throughout the factory, which has played a significant role in increasing output.
　　In April, the water pump used by the tanning section broke down. The Zhangyuan Machine Factory was asked to repair it for three days, but the pump still could not be used. Water is indispensable to the tanning section, so the factory had to assign eight workers to carry water every day. The workers were exhausted every day, with sore backs and legs, and the water was still not enough. The administration called on everyone to find ways to overcome the difficulties. Worker Zhang Jiheng was the first to respond, voluntarily going down the well to repair it for a day. Because the well was 14 fathoms deep, the air was thin, and he was exhausted, he fell ill for three days. After careful consideration, Comrade Li Han, with the consent of the head of the engineering section, took his tools and went down the well. After two days and two nights of careful inspection and research, he found that the ball bearings of the water pump were malfunctioning due to excessive mud, and the shaft and copper sleeve did not fit properly. The toothed copper wheel inside the water pump was rubbing against the walls of the water pump. The water pump was made up of five sections connected together, and the oil paper sandwiched between the sections was too thick. At the same time, the screws had loosened over time, so there were air leaks at the joints. He took out the ball bearings, cleaned them with gasoline, then removed a layer of oil paper, and tightened the screws. The water pump then successfully drew water. This immediately removed a major obstacle to production and saved the factory eight man-days of labor per day.
　　In the production competition, he saw that the hand-cranked machine for rolling fragrant cowhide was too labor-intensive, inefficient, and of poor quality. He then suggested to the administration that electricity be used to drive the machine. With the administration's approval, he immediately began the conversion himself. As a result, a small electric roller of one horsepower was used, and a belt was installed on the wheel of the hand-cranked machine. The production volume was doubled compared to before, and the quality was also improved.
　　On one occasion, he went to the warehouse to collect materials and found a broken machine in the warehouse, which used to be used for rolling plum blossom leather. He suggested to the engineering section that the broken machine be repaired and used to replace manual labor in making suede and napped leather. After approval from the administration, he painstakingly researched and wrapped a hemp rope around the shaft to form a circular wheel, then poured glue on it, and wrapped the outside with gauze to create a very delicate grinding wheel. At the same time, a small electric roller of one horsepower was shared with the fragrant cowhide rolling machine to drive it. After testing, the results were good, and the output was increased by one and a half times compared to manual labor. The quality was also much better than before. Comrade Li Han's spirit of painstaking research has won the praise of all comrades in the factory, and all employees are enthusiastically learning from him.

　　内蒙古制革厂李翰同志改进生产工具提高产量
    张家口内蒙古制革厂制革股股长李翰同志，在最近全厂开展的生产竞赛中苦心钻研，改进生产工具，在提高产量上起了很大作用。
    四月间，制革股用的水泵坏了，请张垣机器厂修理了三天，水泵仍不能用。水是制革股不可缺少的，该厂只好每天抽出八个工人来挑水。工友们每天累得腰酸腿痛，水还是不够用。行政上号召大家想办法克服困难。工人张吉衡首先响应，自动下井修了一天。因井深十四丈，空气稀薄，加上劳累，病了三天。李翰同志再三考虑后，就在工务科长的同意下带上工具下井去。经过两天两夜的细心检查、研究，他发现水泵的滚珠因泥多而失灵了，轴与铜套不合，水泵里的齿形铜轮，与水泵四壁发生磨擦。水泵是五节连在一起的，节与节相接之处，夹的油皮纸太厚，同时因时间久了，螺丝钉也松了，所以接口处也漏气。他把滚珠弄出来，用汽油洗干净，然后把油皮纸去掉一层，上紧了螺丝，于是水泵就很顺利地上水了。这一下子可解除了生产上的一个大障碍，并使三厂每天节省了八个人工的开支。
    在生产竞赛中，他看到轧香牛皮的手摇机太费人力，效率低，质量差。他于是就向行政上建议改用电力来带动机器。经行政上同意后，他即亲自下手改装。结果用一匹马力的小电滚子，在手摇机的轮子上装上皮带，生产量较前提高了一倍，质量上也提高了。
    有一次，他到库房去领料，发现仓库里有一架破机器，过去是轧梅花皮的。他向工务科提议把这部破机器加以修理，利用它来代替人工做?皮和翻毛皮。经行政上批准以后，经他苦心钻研，用麻绳在轴上缠成一个圆形的轮，再灌上胶水，外面用纱布包好，便成为一个很精致的砂轮。同时和轧香牛皮的机器合用一匹马力的小电滚子来带动。经试验后，成绩良好，在产量上比人力提高一倍半。质量也较前好得多。李翰同志这种苦心钻研的精神，获得全厂同志的赞扬，所有职工都热忱地向他学习。
