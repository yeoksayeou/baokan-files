Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government Administration Council issued instructions on July 25th regarding providing relief to unemployed teachers and addressing the issue of students out of school. The full text is as follows:

Currently, with the exception of the Northeast, there are still instances of teacher unemployment and students out of school in various regions, particularly in the newly liberated areas. In some places, this is quite severe. This phenomenon of unemployment and school dropouts already existed during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, due to the war wounds not yet fully healed, financial difficulties, the old economic structure being reorganized, coupled with the bandit Chiang Kai-shek's blockade and bombing, and natural disasters in some areas, as well as the fact that some old school education content cannot meet the needs of the new society, and improper management methods, some schools have been closed (the vast majority being private schools), resulting in an increase in the number of people out of school and unemployed. This is, of course, a temporary difficulty in the transitional period. According to the experience of the Northeast, after the completion of land reform and the initial recovery of production, not only can this difficulty be completely overcome, but on the basis of the new social life, the number of schools and students will greatly increase. Not only will intellectuals not be in surplus, but there will be a feeling of shortage. There is no doubt about this. However, in the current situation, the government and the people must work together to gradually and appropriately resolve this temporary difficulty. Therefore, in order to help unemployed teachers and students out of school solve the problems of employment and learning as quickly as possible, the following instructions are hereby issued:

I. The Military and Administrative Committees of the East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest Great Administrative Regions, and the People's Governments of the provinces and cities under their jurisdiction, and the People's Governments of the provinces and cities in North China, in addition to maintaining public schools as much as possible, should actively maintain existing private schools in various cities based on the principle of taking both public and private interests into consideration, and lead them to carry out necessary and possible reforms; reduce tuition fees, enroll more students, teachers and students help each other, find more ways, rely on their own efforts, and overcome difficulties. Private schools that are well-managed and still unable to maintain themselves despite various efforts should be given appropriate financial subsidies by the government. A small number of schools that are poorly managed and truly unable to maintain and transform may be advised to merge with other schools. Their students and faculty should be properly安置安置.

II. The aforementioned Military and Administrative Committees of the Great Administrative Regions and the People's Governments of the provinces and cities should appropriately increase the number of people's scholarships in public schools, and also set up people's scholarships in private schools, so as to enable students who are truly out of school due to economic difficulties to return to school. The methods shall be determined by the education departments of the Military and Administrative Committees of the Great Administrative Regions based on specific circumstances.

III. The People's Governments of the provinces, cities (or counties) in the aforementioned Great Administrative Regions should, as far as possible, run primary and secondary school teacher training classes and other training classes, absorb unemployed primary and secondary school teachers, provide them with political and ideological education, and supplement them with various professional education. After graduation, some can be appropriately assigned jobs, and others can return to educational work when schools recover and increase in the future.

IV. In addition to continuing to run the People's Revolutionary University in the aforementioned regions, the Military and Administrative Committees of the Great Administrative Regions and the People's Governments of the provinces and cities should use existing school facilities in large cities to run various short-term vocational training classes, tutoring classes, and night schools, etc., to absorb unemployed young people from universities and middle schools and unemployed intellectuals, and conduct political and cultural education or vocational training (such as accounting, cooperatives, trade, taxation, etc.); after graduation, try to introduce them to participate in various construction work.

V. In addition to the above four measures, in cities where unemployment relief for workers is being carried out, for those engaged in cultural, artistic, and educational work who became unemployed after liberation and have no work or other income, the relief measures should be in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Interim Measures for Relief of Unemployed Workers approved by the Government Administration Council on June 17, 1950, and be coordinated by the Municipal Committee for Relief of Unemployed Workers. The Municipal People's Government should also appoint representatives from the Education Bureau, Culture Bureau, or Cultural and Educational Bureau to participate in the Unemployment Relief Committee. For the registration of the aforementioned intellectuals, in addition to education workers being handled by the local education workers' union entrusted by the Unemployment Relief Committee, other unemployed cultural, artistic, news, and publishing personnel shall be assisted by the Culture Bureau or the Cultural and Educational Bureau in the Unemployment Relief Office. In addition to introducing occupations as much as possible for unemployed intellectuals, they should be assigned to participate in various social service work (such as workers' and citizens' spare-time literacy schools, cultural and educational work for unemployed workers, etc.) in the spirit of work-for-relief, and issue living allowances; those who cannot be assigned work should be organized to study and issued unemployment relief funds in accordance with the provisions of Chapters 8 and 9 of the Interim Measures for Relief of Unemployed Workers. This expense shall be uniformly allocated from the Unemployment Relief Fund.

The People's Governments in various places must attach importance to this work, earnestly implement these instructions, and report the implementation status to the higher levels at any time.

                                       Premier Zhou Enlai
                                       July 25, 1950

　　政务院周恩来总理发布指示
    妥善救济失业教师  处理学生失学问题
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理于七月二十五日发布关于救济失业教师与处理学生失学问题的指示。其全文如下：
    目前除东北外，在各地区，特别是新解放地区，还有教师失业和学生失学的现象，有些地方且相当严重。这种失业失学的现象，在国民党反动派统治时期即已存在。解放以后，由于战争创伤尚未完全恢复，财政尚有困难，旧的经济结构正在改组，加以蒋匪帮封锁轰炸和某些地区发生灾荒，同时又由于一部分旧的学校教育内容不能适应新社会的需要，管理办法不当，以致部分学校停闭（绝大多数为私立学校），失学失业的人数因而增多。这当然是过渡时期一种暂时的困难。根据东北的经验，在土地改革完成、生产初步恢复之后，不但可以完全克服这种困难，而且在新的社会生活基础上，学校和学生的数量都将大大增加，知识分子不但不会过剩，并且会感到不足。这是毋庸怀疑的。但就目前情形来说，必须政府和人民协同努力，才能使这种暂时的困难逐步地得到适当解决。因此，为要尽可能迅速地帮助失业教师和失学学生解决就业和学习的问题，特发布如下的指示：
    一、华东、中南、西南、西北各大行政区军政委员会及所属各省市人民政府，华北各省市人民政府除尽可能维持公立学校外，应本公私兼顾的原则，积极维持各地城市中现有的私立学校，并领导其进行必要的和可能的改革；减低学费，多收学生，师生互助，多想办法，自力更生，克服困难。私立学校中，办理成绩较好，经多方设法而仍无法维持者，政府应予以适当的经费补助。少数办理太坏而确实无法维持和改造者，可劝导其和其他学校合并。其学生及教职员，均应予以适当的安置。
    二、上述各大行政区军政委员会及各省市人民政府应适当地增加公立学校的人民助学金名额，并在私立学校酌设人民助学金名额，以便使真正因经济困难而失学的学生复学。其办法由各大行政区军政委员会教育部根据具体情况规定之。
    三、上述各大行政区的各省、市（或县）人民政府，应尽可能举办中小学师资训练班及其他各种训练班，吸收失业的中、小学教师，施以政治和思想教育，并辅以各种业务教育，毕业后，一部分可适当分配工作，另一部分则待将来学校恢复和增加时，复返教育工作岗位。
    四、上述各地区除继续办理人民革命大学外，大行政区军政委员会及省市人民政府，应在大城市中利用现有的学校设备，在地方财政情况许可下，举办各种短期专业训练班、补习班及夜校等，吸收大、中学失学青年及失业知识分子入学，进行政治文化教育或专业训练（如会计、合作社、贸易、税务等）；毕业后，设法介绍其参加各项建设工作。
    五、除上述四项办法外，在举办失业工人救济的城市，对于一般从事文化艺术教育事业的工作人员，在解放以后失业，现在尚无工作或其他收入者，其救济办法应依照政务院一九五○年六月十七日批准的救济失业工人暂行办法第三条的规定，由各市救济失业工人委员会负责统筹。市人民政府并应指派教育局、文化局或文教局的代表参加失业工人救济委员会。对于上述知识分子的登记，除教育工作者由失业工人救济委员会委托当地教育工作者工会办理外，其他失业的文化艺术新闻出版工作人员，由文化局或文教局协助失业工人救济处办理之。对于失业知识分子，除尽可能介绍职业外，应本以工代赈的精神，分配他们参加各种社会服务工作（例如工人市民业余补习学校、失业工人的文化教育工作等），发给生活维持费；其无法分配工作者，应按照救济失业工人暂行办法第八章第九章的规定组织学习并发给失业救济金。此项费用均由救济失业工人基金中统一拨付。
    各地人民政府必须重视这一项工作，认真执行本指示，并将执行情形随时逐级报告。
                                       总理  周恩来
                        一九五零年七月二十五日
