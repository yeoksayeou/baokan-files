　　Important Correction by This Newspaper
　　(1) In the headline news on the front page of this newspaper on July 15, "Serious Waste in Production in State-Owned and Publicly-Owned Factories and Mines in Various Places," the first sentence of the second paragraph, "The most significant waste in industrial production," should be changed to "A type of waste in industrial production." The second-to-last line of the same paragraph, "If it can be increased to 40 to 45 percent within two or three years, it can increase the power supply capacity of existing equipment by one time. From this, it can be seen that fully exploiting mechanical efficiency is important to the recovery and development of industrial production," should be changed to: "Reasons for this phenomenon: On the one hand, in some factories and mines, it is to some extent due to the current level of national economic recovery, which cannot fully utilize these equipment; on the other hand, under the existing national economic conditions, some factories and mines, due to poor management, have also failed to fully exploit the efficiency of existing equipment, forming waste in industrial production."
　　(2) In the editorial "Overcoming Serious Waste in Industrial Production" on the same day, in the 17th line, "This year, the plan is to increase by 34.5 percent. And the average utilization rate of power plants in North China is still the highest in the customs. If calculated according to Soviet standards, the power generation of power plants in North China can still be increased by 98 percent compared to this year's plan," should be changed to: "This year, there have been some improvements in this regard. However, the output and utilization rate of some power plants other than state-owned power plants are still very low."

　　本报重要补正
    （一）十五日本报一版头条新闻“各地国营和公营工厂矿山生产中有严重浪费现象”中，第二段第一句“工业生产中最主要的浪费”应改为“工业生产中的一种浪费”。同段倒数第二行“在两三年内如能提高到百分之四十至四十五，即可较现有设备的供电能力提高一倍。由此可见，充分发挥机械效能对恢复与发展工业生产的重要性。”应改为：“形成此种现象的原因：一方面，在某些厂矿中在某种程度上是由于目前国民经济恢复的程度，还不能充分使用这些设备；另方面在既有的国民经济条件下，某些厂矿因为管理不善，也使现有设备效能未能充分发挥，形成工业生产上的浪费。”
    （二）同日社论“克服工业生产中的严重浪费”文中第十七行，“今年计划提高百分之三十四点五。而华北各电厂的平均利用率，还是关内最高的。如果按照苏联标准计算，华北各发电厂的发电量，还可比今年的计划增加百分之九十八。”应改为：“今年在这一方面，已有若干改进。但国营发电厂以外的某些发电厂的出力和利用率还很低。”
