Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: While the Truman government's launching of the war of aggression against Korea and its stepped-up efforts at war mobilization have both been supported by representatives of all factions of the American reactionaries, the infighting and mutual recriminations among the U.S. ruling clique are also developing due to the repeated failures of the U.S. military in Korea and the conflicts of interest caused by Truman's stepped-up war mobilization.

According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 20th, "As news of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Taejon arrived, the struggle between the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S. Senate reached a high point. The conflict between the two parties in the Senate today was the most intense in recent years. Senators from both parties disregarded what is called etiquette and quarreled with each other over the report submitted by the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee investigating McCarthy's accusations." This quarreling even hampered the discussion of an important appropriations bill that day.

After Truman submitted the message to expand the scope of the war, Republican congressmen expressed dissatisfaction with Truman's desire to take this opportunity to strengthen his dictatorial power. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington: "Republican congressmen on the 22nd criticized Truman's demands for certain economic powers. They said that these economic powers would exceed the powers he possessed during World War II. Republican House economic affairs chief spokesman Herget and two other Republican senators were dissatisfied with Truman's pursuit of powers that were 'too broad' and said that some of Truman's proposals were 'unjustified'." Republican Senator Flanders was dissatisfied with Truman's request for the power to "requisition industries manufacturing goods to any extent at will."

Prior to this, quarrels had already broken out within the U.S. ruling group when the Korean War had just broken out. On June 28, Taft, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, immediately demanded in the Senate that Secretary of State Acheson resign because his Far East policy had failed. Taft also attacked Truman himself, accusing him of ordering troops to be sent without going through Congress, "exceeding the powers granted to him by the Constitution." At the same time, Democratic Senate leader Lucas retorted to Taft, saying that his opinion was "clever hindsight" (United Press).

　　美军在朝鲜接连失败
    美统治集团彼此骂闹  内部的矛盾在发展中
    【新华社二十六日讯】杜鲁门政府发动侵略朝鲜的战争以及加紧战争动员的企图，虽然都得到美国反动集团各派代表的支持，但是，由于美军在朝鲜的接连失败，以及由于杜鲁门加紧战争动员而引起利害冲突，美国统治集团之间的争吵与互相倾轧也在发展着。
    据国民党中央社华盛顿二十日电称，“美军撤出大田消息传来之际，美国参院中民主共和两党的争斗正达及高涨阶段。两党今天在参院所表现的冲突，其激烈为近年所仅见。两党参议员已不管什么叫做礼节，就参院外交附属委员会调查麦克锡控告所提出的报告彼此骂闹。”这种骂闹甚至妨碍了当天重要拨款法案的讨论。
    当杜鲁门提出扩大战争范围的咨文之后，共和党议员对于杜鲁门之想借此机会加强独裁权力表示不满。据合众社华盛顿消息：“共和党议员于二十二日责难杜鲁门对一些经济权力的要求。他们说，这些经济权力将超过他在第二次世界大战中所拥有的权力。共和党众院经济问题主要发言人胡尔格特以及另外两个共和党参议员都不满杜鲁门所觅取的权力“过于广泛”，并且说杜鲁门的有一些建议“是没有理由的”。共和党参议员佛兰德斯不满意杜鲁门要求“随意对制造商品的产业加以任何程度征用”的权力。
    在此以前当朝鲜战争刚刚发生之后，美国统治集团内部就发生了争吵。六月二十八日，共和党政策委员会主席塔夫脱即在参院要求国务卿艾奇逊辞职，因为他的远东政策已经失败。塔夫脱还攻击了杜鲁门本人，指责他不经过国会就擅自下令出兵，“超过了宪法授予他的权力”。与此同时，民主党参院领袖鲁卡斯则反讥塔夫脱，说他的意见是“高明的事后之见”（合众社）。
