Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd – The broad masses of peasants in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces are actively demanding the implementation of land reform.

　　Half of Henan Province has already victoriously completed land reform, and in the other half of the province, rural areas have all conducted anti-despot and rent reduction campaigns. In other provinces, the majority of areas launched a large-scale rent reduction and deposit refund movement this spring. In areas where the rent reduction movement was carried out well, the ruling prestige of the landlord class was shattered, and the political consciousness of the broad masses of peasants was universally raised. They have successively requested that the People's Government lead them in carrying out land reform to thoroughly eliminate the feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class and implement a system of peasant land ownership.

　　At the provincial peasant representative meeting held in Hubei Province in March, among the more than two hundred proposals put forward by peasant representatives from various regions, more than eighty were requests for the implementation of land reform.

　　Peasants in Nankang, Ningdu, and other counties in Jiangxi Province have successively written letters to the People's Government and Communist Party leadership organs requesting the implementation of land reform. In a letter to the provincial and county People's Governments, sixty-two peasant representatives from Shishang District in Ningdu County stated: "In 1931, Chairman Mao led us to divide the land, allowing us to live a good life with food and clothing for a period of time; after the Red Army went north to resist Japan in 1934, the feudal landlords took our land back, burned our houses, and many of us were forced to sell our wives and children. Today, we hope that the government will lead us to recover the lost land." In these areas, peasants have organized to prevent and supervise the landlord class from resisting and sabotaging activities such as dispersing land.

　　In the Fourth District of Shaoyang, Hunan, several instances of landlords illegally selling land were discovered. Local peasants demanded that the government punish these lawbreakers according to the law.

　　To welcome the land reform after this autumn harvest, the above-mentioned areas are actively carrying out the rectification and expansion of rural peasant associations and conducting land surveys. The rectification of peasant associations mainly focuses on criticism and self-criticism to enhance the awareness of members and strengthen the purity and internal unity of peasant association organizations. After hearing the news that the land and property of rich peasants would not be touched in the upcoming land reform, rich peasants have expressed their willingness to abide by government laws and regulations and concentrate on production. The production morale of the middle peasant class is becoming more stable. Many middle peasants are requesting to join peasant associations and to work with their poor peasant and farmhand brothers to complete the land reform.

    积极要求实行土改
    各地正整顿农会进行土地调查  富农安心生产中农情绪更稳定
    【新华社汉口三日电】河南、湖北、湖南、江西等省的广大农民积极要求实行土地改革。
    河南省已经有一半地区胜利地完成了土地改革，另一半地区的农村也全部进行过反对恶霸和减租。其他各省大部地区农民都在今春开展了一个大规模的减租退租运动。凡是减租运动开展较好的地区，地主阶级的统治威风就被打落，广大农民的政治觉悟就普遍提高，纷纷要求人民政府领导他们进行土地改革，彻底消灭地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民土地所有制。
    湖北省三月间举行的全省农民代表会议上，各地农民代表提出的二百余件提案中，其中有八十多件是要求实行土地改革的。
    江西省南康、宁都等县农民，纷纷写信给人民政府和共产党的领导机关，要求实行土地改革。在宁都县石上区六十二名农民代表写给省、县人民政府的信上说：“一九三一年，毛主席领导我们分了田，使我们过了一段有吃有穿的好日子；一九三四年红军北上抗日后，封建地主们又把我们的田夺去了，烧了我们的房屋，我们许多人被逼出卖了自己的老婆和孩子。今天希望政府领导我们收回失去的田地。”这些地区，农民已组织起来，防止和监督地主阶级分散土地等反抗破坏活动。
    湖南邵阳四区曾发现数起地主不法地偷卖地的事情，当地农民要求政府将这些不法分子依法惩罚。
    为迎接今年秋后的土地改革，上述地区各地正积极进行整顿和壮大乡村农民协会，进行土地调查等工作。整顿农会主要是以批评和自我批评为主，以求提高会员的觉悟，加强农会组织的纯洁性和内部团结。各地富农听到今后土地改革中不动富农土地财产的消息后，都表示愿意遵守政府法令，好好安心生产。中农阶层的生产情绪更趋稳定。许多中农要求参加农会，要与贫农、雇农弟兄一起来为完成土地改革而奋斗。
