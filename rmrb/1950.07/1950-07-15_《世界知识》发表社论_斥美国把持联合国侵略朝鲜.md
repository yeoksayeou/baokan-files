　　*World Knowledge* Publishes Editorial
    Condemning the United States for Controlling the United Nations and Invading Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, 14th] The *World Knowledge* weekly, published today, features an editorial entitled "The Illegality of the Security Council's Resolution on the Korean Question under the Coercion of U.S. Imperialism," stating: It is unprecedented for a major power to directly invade a small country by force under the name of an international organization, as U.S. imperialism has done in Korea. The editorial then points out: The United Nations, which aims to "maintain international peace and security," is now being controlled by the United States and used as a tool for war. However, the illegal resolutions and measures taken by the United Nations on the Korean issue did not begin with the illegal resolutions adopted on June 25th and 27th of this year, but have been consistent. The editorial then describes in detail the process by which the Korean issue was illegally placed on the agenda of the second United Nations General Assembly in September 1947 under the control of the United States, the illegal establishment of the "Korean Provisional Committee," the decision of the so-called "Small General Assembly" to hold separate and divisive "elections" in South Korea, and the illegal passage by the third United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 of the recognition of the Syngman Rhee puppet government as the only legitimate government in Korea. The editorial points out that this series of illegal resolutions, illegal actions, and illegal organizations were all carried out in the name of the United Nations. The "Security Council resolutions" of June 25th and 27th are the result of this series of illegal actions.

    The editorial goes on to point out the illegality of the "Security Council's decision," stating that the United Nations Charter stipulates that the United Nations shall not interfere in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state. The Korean issue is a domestic issue, not an international issue, and therefore the Security Council has no basis to determine that a "threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression" exists. Moreover, in this vote on non-procedural matters by the Security Council, the permanent member state, the Soviet Union, was not present, and another permanent member state, China, was represented by the illegal Kuomintang. This fully confirms that the "Security Council's resolution" itself violates the United Nations Charter and is completely illegal.

    The editorial concludes by saying that, on the Korean issue, the United Nations, under the control of a major power, has evolved into an illegal armed intervention in the internal affairs of a country, setting a bad precedent in the history of modern international relations and in the records of the United Nations.

    斥美国把持联合国侵略朝鲜
    【新华社十四日讯】今日出版的世界知识周刊以《美帝挟持下安理会对朝鲜问题决议的非法性》为题，发表社论说：一个大国利用一种国际组织的名义，直接以武力侵略另一个小国，如美帝国主义对朝鲜那样，是史无前例的。社评接着指出：以“维持国际和平及其安全”为目的的联合国，今天却被美国把持从事为战争的工具。但联合国对朝鲜问题所作的非法决议与非法措施，并不是自今年六月二十五、二十七日所采取的非法决议开始，而是一贯的。社论继即详细叙述在美国的把持下，朝鲜问题被非法地列入一九四七年九月的第二届联合国大会议程的经过，“朝鲜临时委员会”非法成立的经过，所谓“小型联大”决定在南朝鲜举行单独的分裂的“选举”的经过，以及一九四八年十二月第三届联合国大会非法通过承认李承晚傀儡政府为朝鲜境内唯一合法政府的经过。社论指出：这一连串的非法决议，非法行动，非法组织，总是在联合国的名义下进行的。六月二十五、二十七日“安理会的决议”，正是这一连串的非法行动的结果。
    社论进而指出“安理会的决定”的非法性称：联合国宪章规定联合国不得干涉在本质上属于国内管辖的事件，朝鲜问题是国内问题而非国际问题，因此安理会没有任何根据来断定“和平之威胁、和平之破坏、或侵略行为”之已经存在。而且，安理会这次非程序事项的表决，没有常任理事国苏联在场，而另一常任理事国中国又是非法的国民党的代表。由此可以完全证实“安理会的决议”本身是破坏联合国宪章的，是完全非法的。
    社论最后说：在朝鲜问题上，联合国在一个大国的把持下，演变出一种非法武装干涉一个国家的内政的结果，这在近代国际关系历史上，在联合国纪录上，造成了一个恶例。
