　　Huailai County People Cherish the People's Railway
    Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau Letter to the Editor:
    I am reporting to you on the enthusiastic protection of the railway by the people of Huailai County.
    The Jing-Sui Railway between Beijing and Zhangjiakou has a 104-li section within Huailai County. A certain part of this is located in a deep mountainous area, making the railway extremely vulnerable to sabotage by bandits and special agents. Under unified leadership, Huailai County has formed grassroots railway protection organizations responsible for protecting the railway. Based on village distances, nineteen joint defense railway protection command posts were organized. In one hundred and thirty-eight villages, railway protection squads based on the militia were established, with regulations for meetings, reporting, summaries, rewards, and punishments. If an accident occurs, the village reports to the district within two hours, the district reports to the county within three to five hours, and the county reports to the sub-district based on the situation. To facilitate tracing responsibility, the 10,788 rails, thirty-five bridges of various sizes, and 1,708 utility poles within the jurisdiction's railway were assigned to specific militia members based on their numbers. Cadres from the county and district public security armed forces continuously conduct nighttime inspections. Since April of last year, for more than a year, the railway within the county has not suffered any serious damage, ensuring the safety of train operations. The highly responsible spirit of Huailai County towards the People's Railway is worthy of emulation by all regions.

　　怀来县群众爱护人民铁路
    张家口铁路分局来信报告编者同志：
    我向你们报告怀来县人民热心保护铁路的情形。
    京绥铁路北京至张家口间的怀来县境内铁路线长一○四华里。其中一段因地处深山地带，铁道极易为匪特破坏。怀来县即在统一领导下，组成了基层护路组织，负责保护铁路。根据村间距离，组织了十九个联防护路指挥所，并在一百三十八个村中，都建立了以民兵为基础的护路小队，规定会议、汇报、总结、奖惩等制度。如某处发生事故，由村在两小时内报到区，区在三至五小时内报到县，县再根据情况报告分区。为了便于追查责任，又把辖境内铁路上的铁轨一○七八八根，大小桥梁三十五座，电杆一七○八根，逐件的按民兵人数划分责任。县、区各公安武装部队的干部，均在夜间不断进行检查。自去年四月起，一年多以来，该县境内铁路未遭到严重的破坏，保障了行车安全。怀来县此种对人民铁路高度负责的精神，是值得各地学习的。
