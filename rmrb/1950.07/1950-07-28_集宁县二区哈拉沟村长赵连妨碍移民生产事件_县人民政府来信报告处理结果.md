To the Editors:

After reading the news in your newspaper on June 15th about Zhao Lian, the village chief of Halahou Village, Second District of our county, obstructing immigrant production, we immediately summoned Village Chief Zhao Lian to the county to make a self-criticism. On the 19th, we sent Comrade Wang Danfeng, the head of the Civil Affairs Section, to the village to conduct an in-depth investigation and understanding of the situation, and to handle it accordingly. The specific situation is written below:

It is a complete fact that Village Chief Zhao Lian occupied two tile-roofed houses (left by fleeing landlords) that were originally prepared for the immigrants before they arrived in the village. After the immigrants arrived, because they did not know how to judge the quality of cattle, the district asked Village Chief Zhao Lian to find experienced farmers to help the immigrants buy cattle, but he did not take responsibility for this. He bought whatever was being sold, regardless of quality. As a result, he spent 7.9 million yuan to buy an inferior seven-year-old ox with a lame leg, which was unable to produce. He also bought a twelve-year-old ox from Wang Erdi in the village for 5.3 million yuan, which refused to eat grass and could not produce. Wang Erdi, the seller of the ox, treated him to drinks and meals because he successfully sold the ox through deception. On May 6th, the ox was used to pull a cart carrying only 400 catties of goods to Jining City. Although the journey was only 40 li, the old ox collapsed three times. On the 8th, the immigrant team leader, Li Liankui, went to the district to discuss the matter with the civil affairs assistant. Chai Dianling, the civil affairs assistant, wrote a letter to Assistant Xu, who was working in the village, asking Zhao Lian to be responsible for returning the old ox and buying a good one to avoid delaying the immigrants' production. However, Zhao Lian refused again. The immigrants had no choice but to try for a few more days, but the old ox still refused to eat grass and could not work. Therefore, they went to the district for instructions for the second time, and Deputy District Chief Xiao personally went to the village for inspection. After arriving in the village, Deputy District Chief Xiao blindly believed the reports from individual cadres and old farmers, saying how the immigrants were not diligent in feeding the cattle and had ruined them. After looking at the thin ox, he said to the immigrants, "I used to herd cattle. As long as you feed it well, it will be able to work. I don't see anything wrong with this ox!" The immigrants had no choice but to continue feeding it reluctantly after hearing the words of the district chief. As a result, after three days of heavy rain on May 30th, the old ox was drenched in the rain and refused to eat grass, and died. After the ox died, Village Chief Zhao Lian insisted that the immigrants had starved the ox to death and wanted to sell the dead ox for three dou of naked oats, which he priced himself, in order to profit from it. The immigrants disagreed and went to a nearby village to sell a stone of naked oats themselves.

Our investigation has proven that Village Chief Zhao Lian was a new cadre promoted when our county was liberated in 1948. He came from a poor peasant background. During his tenure, he consistently used coercion and commandism in his work, and had unreasonably beaten the masses four times, embezzled rent reduction grain, and privately reclaimed more than 30 mu of land from farmers (he cultivated more than 10 mu himself and gave more than 10 mu to his relatives), among other illegal acts.

Based on this situation, we have decided to take the following actions:

(1) Village Chief Zhao Lian must vacate the good house he occupied and give it to the immigrants to live in.

(2) He was irresponsible in buying cattle and accepted bribes from the seller. He resisted the district chief's instructions to be responsible for the return of the ox. After the ox died, he not only failed to make a deep self-criticism but also falsely accused the immigrants and insulted them. The village chief is now ordered to publicly admit his mistakes and apologize to the immigrants. Wang Erdi deceived the immigrants by selling a bad ox at a high price. He is ordered to return one-third of the original price of the ox so that the immigrants can add the grain price from selling the dead ox to buy a good ox for production.

(3) The fruit of the rent reduction privately seized from the masses should be returned to the farmers' association in its entirety and appropriately distributed to the farmers.

(4) Apologize to the masses who were beaten.

(5) In order to strictly enforce the law, restore the prestige of the People's Government, and transform the village government, Zhao Lian is dismissed from his position as village chief.

(6) Deputy District Chief Xiao Hairun did not conduct an in-depth investigation, failed to properly handle the immigrants' complaints, and blindly listened to the one-sided words of individual masses, saying that the immigrants were bad. This kind of bureaucratic work style and irresponsible attitude, in addition to ordering him to make a public self-criticism to the masses, will also be given an administrative reprimand.

### 集宁县二区哈拉沟村长赵连妨碍移民生产事件  县人民政府来信报告处理结果

　　集宁县二区哈拉沟村长赵连妨碍移民生产事件     
    县人民政府来信报告处理结果编辑同志：
    读到六月十五日贵报登载的我县二区哈拉沟村长赵连妨碍移民生产消息后，我们当即调该村长赵连到县，让他作了检讨。并于十九日派民政科长王丹枫同志亲到该村深入调查、了解，作了处理。兹将具体情况写在下面：
    村长赵连在移民未到村前，即将原给移民准备好的瓦房两间（系逃亡地主所留的）抢住了。这完全是事实。移民来了之后，因为移民不懂牛的好坏，区里要村长赵连找识牛的老户帮助移民买牛，但他并未负责这样作。他不管好坏，有人卖就买，结果花了七十九万元的大价，买下一条七岁口、一腿后叉的劣牛，无法生产；又以五十三万元买下本村王二地的十二岁口不肯吃草不能生产的老牛。卖牛户王二地因为骗卖成功，请他喝酒吃饭。五月六日用该牛拉载重仅四百斤的车到集宁城里，路程虽只有四十里，但老牛竟倒卧了三次。八日移民即要求退牛，被赵连拒绝。移民组长李连魁到区向民政助理员商讨，民政助理员柴殿岭写信给在该村工作的徐助理员，要赵连负责退走老牛，再买好的，以免耽误移民生产。但又被赵连拒绝。移民无法，又试了几天，老牛仍然不肯吃草，不能作活。于是第二次又到区上请示，由萧副区长亲自到该村检查。萧副区长到村后，轻信个别干部及老户的反映，说移民如何喂养不勤，把牛弄坏了。他看了牛很瘦，就对移民说：“我过去放过牛，只要好好喂养，就能干活。我看这牛没有毛病！”移民听了区长的话，只得继续勉强喂养。结果到五月三十日下了三天大雨，老牛淋了雨水；又不肯吃草，便死了。牛死后，村长赵连反而一口咬定是移民把牛饿死了，并由自己定价莜麦三斗要移民将死牛出卖，又想从中取利。移民不同意，自己到旁的村卖了一石莜麦。
    经我们调查证明，村长赵连系一九四八年本县解放时提拔起来的新干部。出身雇农。他在任职期间，工作上一贯强迫命令，曾有四次无理殴打群众，贪污减租粮，私自收回农民土地三十余亩（自己种了十余亩，给其亲戚种了十余亩）等等不法行为。
    根据这种情况，我们决定作如下处理：
    （一）要村长赵连退出所占住的好房子，给移民住。
    （二）买牛不负责，并受卖主贿赂。区长指示他负责退回，竟表现抗拒；牛死后自己不但不作深刻检讨，反而诬赖移民，辱骂移民。现已令该村长向移民公开承认错误，赔情道歉。王二地欺瞒移民，高价出卖坏牛，令其退回原牛价三分之一，使移民添上卖去死牛的粮价再买一条好牛，以进行生产。
    （三）私吞群众减租果实，应原数归还农会，并适当分配给农民。
    （四）向挨打的群众赔情认错。
    （五）为了严整法纪，挽回人民政府的威信，改造该村政权，撤销赵连的村长职务。
    （六）副区长萧海润，不深入调查，未适当处理移民的控告，反而盲目地听信个别群众一面之词，说移民不好。此种官僚主义作风，不负责任的态度，除令其向群众公开检讨外，并在行政上予以通报批评。
