　　Wuhan Smashes Two Major Armed Spy Organizations
    Ring Leaders and Key Spies All Captured
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 27th] The Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau has cracked down on two major reactionary armed spy organizations潜伏 within the city: the bandit "National Defense Ministry Youth Salvation Corps Jianghan Righteous Volunteer Third Detachment" and the bandit "Hubei Province Jing (Shan) Han (Chuan) Ying (County) Three-County Military and Political Commissioner's Office." Bandit leader and pseudo-Major General Commander and pseudo-Military and Political Commissioner Hu Zimin, along with all 68 key spy members, including Hu Zhibin and Guo Xieqing, have been captured. A total of 31 items were seized, including three pistols, officer rosters, organizational documents, plans to establish a radio station, and appointment orders, as well as 18 official seals, stamps, and chop marks. This is the largest Kuomintang spy case cracked in Wuhan since liberation. Bandit leader Hu Zimin joined the bandit spy organization in 1941 and received training in Chiang Kai-shek's "Suppression of Rebellion and Nation Building Training Class." He successively held positions such as secretary of the Hanchuan County Three Principles of the People Youth League, Lieutenant Colonel Captain of the bandit National Defense Ministry People's Service Second Corps, Deputy Instructor of the pseudo-Pacification Seventh Brigade, and Captain of the Shanghai "Suppression of Rebellion and Nation Building Brigade." The main tasks of the above two bandit spy organizations were to establish "underground armed forces," carry out robbery, spy on military intelligence, sabotage various construction projects, organize riots, and attempt to establish so-called "enemy-occupied area regimes."
    On the 17th, the Wuhan Changjiang Daily published a commentary on this matter, calling on the people of the city and various organizations to overcome complacency, heighten vigilance, strictly guard against spy activities, and requesting that all departments strengthen security education and, in accordance with the State Council's instructions on protecting state secrets, formulate security systems suitable for the specific circumstances of each department.

　　武汉破获两大特务武装组织
    匪首主要特务全部落网
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】武汉市人民政府公安总局已破获潜伏市内的匪“国防部青年救国团江汉义勇第三总队”及匪“湖北省京（山）汉（川）应（县）三县军政特派员公署”二大反动武装特务组织。匪首伪少将总队长兼伪军政特派员胡孑民以下各主要特务分子胡志斌、郭燮卿等六十八人全部落网。计缴获短枪三支、官佐名册、组织文件、建立电台计划、委派令等证件共三十一件，关防、印章、条戳等十八件。这是武汉市解放以来破获国民党特务案件中最大的一案。匪首胡孑民在一九四一年即参加匪特务组织，曾在蒋匪经国举办之“戡乱建国训练班”受训，历任汉川县三民主义青年团书记、匪国防部人民服务二总队中校队长、伪绥靖七大队副指导员、上海“戡乱建国大队”大队长等职。上述两匪特组织的主要任务是：成立“地下武装”，进行抢劫，刺探军情，破坏各种建设，组织暴动，妄图建立所谓“敌后政权”。
    十七日，武汉长江日报曾就此事发表评论，号召全市人民及各机关团体克服麻痹大意，提高警惕性，严防特务活动，并要求各部门加强保密教育，根据政务院保卫国家机密的指示，订出适合各部门具体情况的保密制度。
