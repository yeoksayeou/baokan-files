How the Afforestation Bureau Carries Out Work in the Hebei-West Sandy Wasteland
Lin Kenbu Hebei-West Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau

(1) Starting from the Urgent Needs of the Masses in the Sandy Wasteland Area

The six counties of Xingtang, Quyang, Zhengding, Xinle, Wuji, and Gaocheng along the Jinghan Railway in western Hebei are covered with sandy wasteland. Among them, the three major sandy wastelands formed by river diversions, namely the Old Ci River, Shendao Beach, and the Sha River breach beach, have a pure wasteland area of more than 92,000 mu. Including other pure sandy wastelands and semi-utilized sandy wastelands, the total area is about 510,000 mu (320,000 mu of pure sandy wasteland). The wind and sand near the sandy wasteland are extremely harmful, encroaching on arable land, destroying crops, and turning good land into desert. According to statistics from four villages including Huangjiazhuang in Xinle, 52 wells have been filled with sand and more than 1,500 mu of irrigated land have been turned into sandy wasteland in the past ten years. According to a survey of 85 villages in the county, sandy wasteland and wind-blown land account for 53 percent of the total cultivated land area. In the spring of 1949, a sandstorm affected 190,000 mu of wheat and pea fields in the county, with an average yield reduction of about 60 percent. Under the severe threat of wind and sand, the masses urgently demanded afforestation to prevent disasters and ensure agricultural production. For example, Fan Laozai of Xizheng Village, Xingtang, said: "If my family's land is not planted with trees to block the wind in three years, we will not be able to eat." The masses in Dagai Village, Quyang, said: "Whoever subdues the sand, we will build a temple for him." After the land reform, this demand became even more urgent. However, due to the destruction of trees by the enemy and puppets in the past, there was an extreme shortage of poplar and willow saplings in the local area. At the same time, planting trees in dry sandy wasteland is not easy to survive without mastering the technology. The forest protection work in most villages has not been done well, and farmers still have concerns about planting trees. Afforestation work can only be vigorously carried out under strong organizational leadership. In order to promote this work in a focused and planned manner, the North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture established the Hebei-West Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau in Nanhua Village, the center of the Old Ci River sandy wasteland, in 1949 to gain experience and gradually eliminate the sandy wasteland in North China.

(2) The Nature and Organization of the Afforestation Bureau

At the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference at that time, it was determined that the Afforestation Bureau had the responsibility to guide, supervise, and inspect the local government in afforestation work, and to jointly organize the masses with the local government to carry out cooperative afforestation. In terms of business, it must have precise plans, calculate costs, and gradually achieve enterprise-based management. The scope of work includes the six counties of Xingtang, Quyang, Zhengding, Xinle, Wuji, and Gaocheng, and the two special districts to which they belong (now Dingxian and Shijiazhuang special districts). Each of the agricultural and forestry sections of the six counties and two special districts is equipped with one professional cadre, who is under the dual leadership of each section and the Afforestation Bureau. In late February 1949, the Ministry of Agriculture held the Hebei-West Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Conference in Zhengding to study the technology of sandy wasteland afforestation and the method of organizing the masses for cooperative afforestation, and formulated a three-season afforestation plan for the six counties throughout the year. Then, in the vigorous development of the spring afforestation campaign, the Afforestation Bureau was established in a simple and crude manner. At that time, it had not yet received funding, and there were only four cadres and one worker. Everyone put together the prepaid food and vegetable money for two months as start-up funds, borrowed houses from the villagers, mobilized the masses in nearby villages to plant trees, and prepared nurseries. Together with the four people from the Ministry of Agriculture, they participated in the afforestation of various counties. Thanks to everyone's efforts, and thanks to the close cooperation and in-depth work of the Jizhong Afforestation Team and the cadres of various counties, we completed a total of more than 2.56 million trees in the spring season, exceeding the original three-season afforestation plan by 27 percent. We also hurriedly completed the sowing of 30 mu of bureau-operated nurseries and more than 70 mu of public and private nurseries in various counties, and loaned out 3,000 catties of various tree seeds. With the development of business, the bureau was divided into three sections: afforestation, seed and seedling, and general affairs. The number of cadres was 13 in the first half of the year and increased to 22 in the second half of the year. In addition to the six technical cadres from other places, all were equipped locally. Comrade Jia Lanhu, the afforestation hero of Xingtang County, was one of them. He has rich experience in afforestation and river management, and has led the masses of his hometown, Gujun Village, to cooperate in planting more than 100,000 trees, preventing the harm of wind and sand, and winning the support of the whole village. Every season of afforestation, he must take the lead, mobilize the whole family to participate, lead the masses, and go deep into various villages to personally master the technology, which has improved everyone's enthusiasm for afforestation.

(3) Relying on the Masses, Organizing Them, and Improving Technology

Our work relies on the masses everywhere, because only in this way can we overcome the difficulties in labor, tree seedlings, and protection with very little funding (300,000 catties of millet throughout the year, most of which is used for the establishment of nurseries and employee supply), improve technology, and complete the plan. In terms of organization, some villages in the sandy wasteland area originally had cooperative afforestation organizations such as "Tree Associations," that is, neighbors in wind-blown land united ten or eight households, shared labor and tree seedlings, and jointly afforested to prevent disasters, signed contracts, and later, when the trees grew up, they shared dividends according to shares. Based on this existing organizational form and the specific conditions unique to each village, we assisted the masses in organizing and established public-private joint venture cooperative forest farms such as the Old Ci River, which became an organization loved by the masses. In terms of technology, we introduced the "bow-shaped layering method" created by farmers in Fanshi, northeast Shanxi, to western Hebei, which increased the survival rate of layering afforestation in dry sandy land to more than 90 percent. During the three seasons of promotion of the "bow-shaped layering method," the method itself has also been greatly improved due to the creation of the masses. For example, Comrade Jia Lanhu used a hoe to dig pits, and used the side of the pit to make a bow-shaped layering, which can double the working speed. Also, everyone has explored that the height of the arch back from the ground should be different in the three seasons: that is, it should be similar to revealing and not revealing in spring, exposing two inches in the rainy season, and not exposing after autumn, which can further improve the survival rate. In terms of seedling raising technology, in order to facilitate promotion, easy for the masses to master, and save labor and money, and can be operated with ordinary agricultural tools, we use a rough seedling raising method similar to planting wheat. Although the seedling output is less, the main afforestation seedlings such as amorpha and locust can be out of the nursery in the same year, which can meet the current urgent need for seedlings. During the spring afforestation, we focused all our efforts on organizing and mobilizing, and paid little attention to technology improvement. However, after the masses were organized, they generally demanded to improve technology. For example, many villages in the seventh district of Xingtang repeatedly asked the Afforestation Bureau to send people to guide the technology before the autumn afforestation began. In 1949, the foundation for three seasons of afforestation had been laid in various counties. The habit of afforestation in summer and autumn was not common, but after convincing the masses with examples through activists, the afforestation campaign could be carried out, and the results exceeded those of spring.

(4) Inspecting Work, Summarizing Experience, and Expanding Business

At the end of each afforestation season, we conduct key inspections and hold summary meetings in order to summarize and exchange experiences as the basis for the next season's work. At the end of the year, after full deliberation, we conducted a global work and cadre ideological inspection. Everyone seriously carried out self-criticism and mutual criticism, and ideologically recognized the root causes of various deviations in work and established a new work and learning system. In the past year, we have also received tremendous education from the masses in organizing the masses. When the Afforestation Bureau was established, some newly arrived cadres were worried about the endless sandy wasteland and believed that "it will never be eliminated in a lifetime." In actual work, they realized the urgent need of the masses to plant trees to prevent disasters and transform the sandy wasteland, saw the unparalleled power of the masses after they were organized, and saw the high enthusiasm and determination to fight against nature of the afforestation models in various villages in the afforestation campaign. Therefore, the confidence and sense of responsibility of each cadre in this cause was improved, and the work efficiency was also improved. Everyone believed that the nearby sandy wasteland could be eliminated in about four years.

Due to local demands and factual needs, the scope of work of the Afforestation Bureau has been expanded in 1950. The general bureau has been moved to Shijiazhuang City, the transportation hub of western Hebei, in order to strengthen administrative links and directly guide the nursery work of twelve counties and the sandy and mountain wasteland afforestation of eight key counties. In addition, two forestry extension farms have been set up at the original site of Nanhua Village in Zhengding County and Donghou Village (the center of the eastern section of Shendao Beach sandy wasteland) in Wuji County. Twenty-five trainees have also been recruited to learn and work at the same time to assist various counties in completing seedling raising, afforestation, and investigation plans. At the same time, a forestry training class for 55 in-service cadres from 25 counties has been held this spring, which has prepared a strong force for this year's work.

Last year, thanks to the efforts of various counties and the strong assistance from all sides, the seven counties (including Dingxian) achieved a huge achievement of planting 9.04 million trees. On this favorable basis, this year we have full confidence to strive to complete the plan of planting 17 million trees and sowing 270 mu of nurseries.

　　造林局怎样在冀西沙荒开展工作
　　林垦部冀西沙荒造林局
   （一）从沙荒区群众的迫切要求出发
    冀西京汉沿线的行唐、曲阳、正定、新乐、无极、藁城等六县，沙荒遍布，其中仅老磁河、神道滩与沙河破堤滩等由河流改道而成的三大沙荒，纯荒面积即达九万二千余亩，加上其他纯沙荒与半利用沙荒，总面积约达五十一万余亩（纯沙荒三十二万亩）。沙荒附近风沙为害甚烈，侵犯耕地，摧毁禾苗，化良田为沙漠，据新乐黄家庄等四村统计，十年来即有五十二眼水井被沙填满，一千五百余亩井浇地变为沙荒，据该县八十五个村的调查，沙荒与犯风地占总耕地面积百分之五十三。一九四九年春季一场风沙，全县十九万亩麦田及豌豆受灾，平均约减收六成。在风沙严重的威胁下，群众迫切的要求造林防灾，保障农业生产。如行唐西正村范老再说：“我家地再有三年不栽树挡风，饭也吃不上了”。曲阳大盖都的群众都说：“谁要是把沙子制服了，我们要给他修个庙”。在土改后，这种要求更见迫切。可是由于过去敌伪对树木的摧残，当地杨柳树秧极为缺乏，同时在干燥沙荒栽树，如不善于掌握技术，不易成活，大多数村庄的护林工作，又没有做好，农民对栽树还存有顾虑，必须在坚强的组织领导下，造林工作才能蓬勃开展。为了有重点，有计划的推动这一工作，一九四九年前华北人民政府农业部在老磁河沙荒中心南化村，设立了冀西沙荒造林局，以求吸收经验，逐步消灭华北的沙荒。
　  （二）造林局的性质与组织
    当时在华北农林会议上，确定了造林局在造林工作上，对当地政府有指导、督促、检查的职责，与当地政府共同组织群众，开展合作造林，在事业上须精密计划，计算成本，逐步作到企业化的经营，工作范围包括行唐、曲阳、正定、新乐、无极、藁城等六县及所属两专署（现定县、石家庄两专署），有关六县两专署的农林科，各设专业干部一人，受各该科与造林局双重领导。一九四九年二月下旬，农业部在正定召开冀西沙荒造林会议，研究沙荒造林技术与组织群众合作造林的方法，制订六县全年三季造林计划，接着在春季造林运动的蓬勃开展中，造林局因陋就简的成立了。当时还未领到经费，只有四个干部，一个工人，大家把预支的二个月粮票菜金，凑在一起作为筹办费，借住老乡的房子，一面发动附近各村群众造林，一面筹设苗圃，并连同农业部的四人，参加了各县的造林。由于大家的努力，由于冀中造林队和各县干部跟我们的密切合作，深入工作，春季竟完成各项造林共二百五十六万余株，一季超过原定三季造林计划百分之二十七，并在匆促中完成了局营苗圃三十亩及各县公私苗圃七十余亩的播种。贷出各种树籽三千斤。随着业务的发展，局内分设造林、种苗与总务三股，上半年干部十三人，下半年增至二十二人，除了六个外地来的技术干部外，都由当地配备，行唐县的造林英雄贾兰虎同志，就是其中之一。他对造林与治河有丰富的经验，曾领导家乡故郡村群众合作造林十万余株，防止了风沙的为害，获得了全村的拥护。每季造林，必以身作则，发动全家参加，带动群众，并深入各村亲自掌握技术，提高了大家对造林的积极性。
   （三）依靠群众、组织起来、提高技术
    我们的工作是处处依靠群众的，因为只有这样，才能以很少的经费（全年小米三十万斤，绝大部分用于建立苗圃与员工供给）克服劳力、树秧及保护上的困难，提高技术，完成计划。在组织方面，沙荒区有些村子本来就有“树会”等合作造林组织，就是犯风地地邻之间为了防止风沙，十户八户联合起来，分摊劳力树秧，共同造林防灾，订立合同，以后树长大了按股分红。我们根据这种旧有的组织形式，及各村特有的具体条件，协助群众组织起来，并以树苗投资，成立公私合营的老磁河等合作林场，成为群众喜爱的组织。在技术方面，我们把晋东北繁峙一带农民创造的“弓形压条法”介绍到冀西来，把干沙地压条造林的成活率提高到百分之九十以上，而“弓形压条法”在三季推广当中，由于群众的创造，方法本身也得到不少的改进，如贾兰虎同志利用镢头刨坑，靠坑的一侧作弓形的压条，能把工作速度提高一倍，还有弓背离地面的高低，大家已摸索出三季应各有不同：就是春季应似露不露，雨季露出二寸，秋后不露，这样更能提高成活率。在育苗技术方面，我们为了便于推广，易为群众所掌握，并且省工省钱，能用普通农具操作，便采用类似种麦子的粗放育苗法，出苗量虽较少，但如紫穗槐、洋槐等主要造林苗木，当年即可出圃，能供给目前苗木的急需。春季造林当中，我们全力放在组织发动上，对技术提高注意尚少，但在群众组织起来以后，便普遍的要求提高技术，如行唐七区很多村子，在秋后造林开始前便再三要求造林局派人指导技术。在一九四九年，各县已经打好了三季造林的基础，夏、秋两季造林习惯本来不普遍，但通过积极分子，以实例说服群众后，造林运动即能开展，成绩均超过春季。
   （四）检查工作、总结经验、扩大业务
    每季造林结束，我们即作重点检查，并召开总结会议，以便总结与交流经验，作为下季的工作基础。年底我们又经充分酝酿，进行全局工作与干部思想检查，大家认真的展开了自我批评与互相批评，从思想上认识了工作上发生各种偏差的根源，建立了新的工作与学习制度，一年来在组织群众当中，我们也受到了群众莫大的教育。造林局成立时，有些新来的干部对着一望无际的沙荒发愁，认为“一辈子也消灭不完”，而在实际工作中，体会到群众造林防灾，改造沙荒的迫切要求，看到了群众组织起来以后有无比的力量，并在造林运动中见到了各村造林模范的高度热情与对自然斗争的坚决性，因而提高了每个干部对这一事业的信心与责任心，也提高了工作效率，都相信只要四年左右便可消灭附近沙荒。
    由于地方上的要求与事实上的需要，造林局的工作范围在一九五○年扩大了，总局移至冀西交通中枢石家庄市，以便加强与行政上的联系，直接指导十二县的苗圃工作与八个重点县的沙荒、山荒造林，另于正定县南化村原址及无极县东候村（神道滩沙荒东段中心）分设两个林业推广场，并招训练生二十五名，一面学习，一面工作，协助各县完成育苗，造林与调查计划，同时今春已举办了二十五县，五十五个在职干部的林业训练班，给今年的工作准备了雄厚的力量。
    去年由于各县的努力与各方面给我们的大力协助，全年七县（定县在内）获得了造林九百零四万株的巨大成绩，在这个有利的基础上，今年我们有充分信心争取完成造林一千七百万株与苗圃播种二百七十亩的计划。
