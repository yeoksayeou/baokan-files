    Now, multiple suspected cholera patients have been found in Zhengzhou, Northern Jiangsu, Huaiyang, and other places. Furthermore, true cholera cases were discovered in Tianjin on July 14th. In order to adapt to the emergency situation and prevent its invasion and spread, the Municipal Government has formulated and hereby announces the "Beijing Municipality 1950 Emergency Measures for Cholera Prevention."

                                       Mayor Nie Rongzhen
                                     Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu

    Beijing Municipality 1950 Emergency Measures for Cholera Prevention

    I. The current emergency measures for cholera prevention in the city should encompass the following main areas of work:

    1. Expand Epidemic Prevention Publicity: Focusing on the current situation, raise public awareness, introduce simple prevention and control methods, report on the current epidemic situation in various regions, encourage acceptance of preventive vaccinations, and emphasize attention to food, drink, and environmental hygiene. The Municipal Health Committee will adopt various methods to conduct extensive publicity. Specific measures will be formulated separately.

    2. Epidemic Reporting: When suspected cholera patients are discovered within the city, citizens should immediately report to the local district health center for investigation and treatment (they can also go directly to the infectious disease hospital for diagnosis and treatment). In areas without health centers, reports should be made to the district office (government) for forwarding to the epidemic prevention team of the Public Health Bureau. If the reporter is a medical worker, they should, after preliminary diagnosis, report to the health center in their district for immediate investigation and treatment, and forward the report to the epidemic prevention team of the Public Health Bureau for registration.

    3. Quarantine: Before the implementation of quarantine work within the city, the Railway Department's Health Bureau will be responsible for conducting on-train quarantine and disinfection for passengers arriving in Beijing by train before they disembark and enter the station. If suspected cholera patients are discovered, the Municipal Public Health Bureau should be contacted for handling.

    4. Preventive Vaccination: A. Primarily focus on injecting single cholera vaccine. Each district health committee will be responsible for designating dates and locations in stages, and announce to the public the scheduled time to receive the injection. Those who have not received the injection by the deadline will be subject to mandatory injection. B. Injections should be carried out on a large scale and in an organized manner, starting with the concentrated implementation in the third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts, where there are more impoverished residents. If district staff is insufficient, the Municipal Health Committee will send personnel to assist in completing the work. C. The vaccination record, used as a supplementary page to the household registration, has established a good foundation in the suburbs. It has been decided to universally adopt it in both urban and suburban districts during this period. The Public Health Bureau will rush to print it for use, and the Public Security Bureau will assist in its promotion.

    5. Strengthen Inspection and Disinfection of Drinking Water: A. The chlorine dosage in tap water should be increased in the near future, and ensure that the southern city's terminal areas maintain a residual chlorine level of 0.1 parts per million. All water source wells within the city will be temporarily suspended from supplying water. The western suburban water plant will immediately install disinfection equipment. B. Public drinking water wells must be universally disinfected, and the number of disinfection times should be increased to two to three times per day. The use of private wells for public drinking is restricted (except for those with special reasons approved by the Public Health Bureau), and inspection and disinfection will be implemented. Those used exclusively for industrial purposes and those with poor water quality will be prohibited from drinking.

    6. Strengthen Food and Drink Management: A. Cold Drinks and Foods: a. All shops and vendors经营经营 cold drinks and foods must have appropriate and reasonable sanitary facilities and strengthen inspection. b. Ice-making and selling stores must have appropriate utensils for vendors to use, and only those inspected and approved by the Public Health Bureau are allowed to wholesale (if the utensils prepared by the vendors themselves meet the conditions, they can also apply to the Public Health Bureau for inspection and approval). c. Except for those with refrigeration equipment, all iced cold foods should use artificial ice. d. In addition to inspection and management, shaved ice, dried fruit, hawthorn soup, sour jujube soup, dried fruit soup, sweet water (made of sugar or saccharin, seasonings, and pigments) will be temporarily advised to stop selling voluntarily during the epidemic prevention period. B. General Foods and Drinks: a. All directly consumed foods should have strict fly-proof equipment. Those that need to be iced but do not have adequate equipment should use artificial ice. b. Rotten food and drink are strictly prohibited from being sold. c. Watermelons must not be cut open for sale unless they have a tight glass or gauze cover with a door. The implementation of the above items A and B should be included in the sanitary convention through the respective industry organizations and supervised by the respective competent bureaus (Public Health Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Commerce Bureau).

    7. Garbage and Excrement Treatment: During the emergency measures period for epidemic prevention, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau will actively strengthen management in coordination with the overall prevention work for the stench of garbage and excrement in the city.

    II. The start and end of the emergency measures period referred to in these measures will be announced to the public in writing by the Municipal Health Committee.

    III. These measures shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.
