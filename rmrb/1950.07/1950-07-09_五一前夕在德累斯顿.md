　　On the Eve of May Day in Dresden
　　Féng Zhì
　　At four o'clock in the afternoon on April 30th, we departed from Berlin by car to Dresden, preparing to participate in the May Day mass rally there. This highway did not pass through any villages or cities, nor did it intersect with any other roads; it simply led directly to Dresden. This was a construction from the Nazi era, and the purpose of its construction was less for transportation than for aggression. In March 1939, when the Nazi bandits plotted and shamelessly occupied all of Czechoslovakia, they naturally marched in from here; but they never dreamed that in May 1945, the Soviet troops on the Berlin front, acting on Stalin's instructions, would extract a portion of their tank forces to rush to the aid of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which was in crisis, and liberate the Czech capital, Prague, also quickly arriving from this road. Today, there are not many traces of the war visible; only a few bridges have been blown up and replaced with temporary wooden bridges. In addition, there are occasionally one or two broken machines lying by the roadside, covered in yellow rust, ignored. Red-tiled houses are sparsely dotted across the green fields, peaceful and monotonous, and I sat in the car thinking only about Berlin, which I had seen yesterday.

　　We flew to Berlin from Moscow yesterday afternoon. Moscow was experiencing a series of beautiful days. To welcome May Day, every building was being refreshed, refreshed and decorated, with words, flags, and statues of Lenin and Stalin. The glass windows were all wiped clean, and the green tiled roof of the Kremlin was also cleaned spotless. But when we arrived in Berlin, it was a gloomy afternoon with no sun, and the climate was even colder than in Moscow. Walking into the city, the calmness was astonishing. Along the sides of several once-bustling streets were either walls left after burning or empty spaces piled with bricks and tiles. We got out of the car in front of the hotel next to Thalmann Square, and the person receiving us pointed to a ruin across the square and said, "This is where Hitler issued orders in the past, and it is also his burial place." But when we attended a small celebration at the Transportation Workers' Union after dinner, the situation was very different. Inside there was cheering and singing, and more than a dozen labor heroes were being commended. As soon as we guests from the distant People's Republic of China entered the hall, they surrounded us. They were transportation workers, and their work easily connected them to distant places. "Salute to victorious China!" "Salute to Mao Zedong!" The shouts continued, and among the various slogans were also mixed "Salute to the transportation workers in Western Europe who refuse to transport war materials!" What moved us most were two young men who stayed by our side from the moment we arrived, repeating over a dozen times, "Please send our greetings to the Chinese youth!" Finally, as we walked out the door and got into the car, they still leaned through the car window and instructed, "Greet the youth of China!"

　　This is a great transformation. The rubble beside the streets buries the crimes of the Hitler era, but here it is full of a peaceful atmosphere, and the workers and youth fully express their enthusiasm for construction and their spirit of internationalism. On the way back from the Transportation Workers' Union, a German friend in the car asked me:
　　"What is your initial impression of Berlin?"
　　"Berlin is too badly destroyed, but the German people have made great progress. This proves that the Socialist Unity Party has played a significant role in leadership."
　　"As long as the German people have progressed and can be included in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, it is worth paying so much price." He pointed to the ruins beside the street as he spoke.

　　On this monotonous highway, I kept thinking about the conversation from last night. A German youth in the car talked to us about Dresden:
　　"The New City of Dresden is still intact, but most of the Old City was destroyed, especially the cultural building area. This was bombed by American planes overnight when the Hitler bandits were about to surrender and the Soviet army was only a few kilometers away from Dresden. That night happened to be when a large number of refugees retreating from Breslau were crowded on the streets and squares, and 350,000 were killed or injured in the bombing—"
　　"Thirty-five thousand?" I didn't believe the number, I thought I had misheard, in fact it might have been thirty-five thousand.
　　"Three hundred and fifty thousand!" He continued, "This bombing was unnecessary, because Dresden was about to be liberated. American planes did not just do this once; whenever the Soviet army approached a culturally or industrially important city, they would bomb it first, not allowing a city to fall intact into the hands of the Soviet army—the hands of the people. At the same time, they also increased the difficulty of the aftermath for the Soviet army after liberating that city."

　　I immediately thought of why the United States rushed to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when the Soviet army was about to declare war on Japan. Although this was not exactly the same as the bombing of Dresden in form, it was essentially due to the same conspiracy.
　　"Let's put aside Dresden for the moment, because at that time Dresden was still Nazi Germany's Dresden. Regardless of whether America's intention was to deal with the enemy Nazis or to deal with the ally Soviet Union, it was still justifiable on the surface. As for Czechoslovakia, it was a country invaded by the Nazis, and many Czech patriots were either fighting in the armies of allied countries abroad or carrying out staunch anti-fascist struggles at home. But in the period when it was about to be liberated, its important factories, such as the Skoda factory and the Bata shoe factory, were bombed by American planes. This is very obvious; at this time, American planes were definitely not dealing with the Nazis, but dealing with their own allies. They were thinking about the post-war market for American monopoly capitalists, destroying Czechoslovakia's most important industries."
　　"What is the situation now?" I said, "Those Nazi bandits who wanted to destroy others to fatten themselves have been buried in the ruins, and the Eastern European countries they invaded are working hard to build and are leaping forward towards socialism. Pitifully, the American monopoly capitalists are extremely bored and are stepping onto the fascist dead end step by step."

　　We arrived in Dresden in the evening. The New City on the north bank of the Elbe River was indeed intact, but after crossing the Augustus Bridge, all the buildings in the Old City, the Renaissance-style palace, the Baroque-style broad casemate, and the gallery famous for its collection of classical drawings, had become a pile of rubble. In the past, tourists to Dresden often spent a lot of time in those places, but now we just drove quickly through, and what we saw was a stone statue lying here and a section of a crumbling wall left there.

　　We arrived at the trade union guest house, and like last night at the Transportation Workers' Union, it was another warm welcome. Inside were trade union cadres, model workers, the Free German Youth Choir, journalists, and government officials. Everyone shook hands as if they were friends who hadn't seen each other for many years; they were concerned about each other's lives and construction, and after a few words, they talked about the liberation of Hainan Island, the Soviet Union's help to the German people, they asked about our Taiwan and Tibet, we asked about their West Germany and West Berlin, and then we talked about Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and Vice Chairman Liu's "On Internationalism and Nationalism."

　　"These two articles," a leading cadre of the Socialist Unity Party said to us, "are already important documents for our party to study. In the past, our study of Marxism-Leninism was too abstract and not related to reality, which caused the tragic failure in 1933. These documents can give us a lot of inspiration and solve many of our problems."

　　In fact, the current situation in Germany is similar to that in China. Isn't the puppet government in Bonn in West Germany equivalent to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? Isn't the American imperialism that was imposed on China in the past now being intensified in West Germany? So we expressed our hope that Germany would be unified quickly and that the American imperialists would be driven out quickly, just as we drove them out of Chinese territory.

　　The Polish representative who came with us also said sadly and forcefully: "German fascists destroyed 85 percent of all Polish cities and buildings. But now I can comfort the German people that Poland still exists. As long as the working people of the two countries join hands, all disputes will be eliminated, let alone war." This reminded me of Stalin's famous saying, "The Hitler bandits have come and gone, but the German people and Germany exist forever." All reactionaries who are enemies of the people, listen to this sentence carefully!

　　Among these people were also those who came from West Germany, some from Nuremberg, some from the Saar region. They were entrusted by the workers of West Germany to greet the workers of the motherland. Yes, West Germany has become a colony of British and American imperialism, and when they come to the German Democratic Republic, they return to the free motherland. The suffering of the people in West Germany under the influence of the Marshall Plan is deepening day by day. The display windows of stores in large cities are filled with American goods, forming a superficial prosperity, but the number of unemployed workers is gradually increasing, now rising from 2.5 million to 3 million. Unreasonable phenomena are everywhere. The representative from Nuremberg gave many specific facts:

　　Leather shoes manufactured in shoe factories cannot be sold anywhere, but American leather shoes fill the market.
　　American cheese is shipped to Germany in large quantities, but Germans cannot afford to buy it and it rots in warehouses. When the government provides relief to unemployed workers, it buys these rotten cheeses and distributes them to the unemployed workers. The workers receive them and ask, "What are we going to do with this cheese?" The answer is: "Sell it in the market, and the money you get will be equal to the relief money."

　　And American detective novels and films that teach theft and obscenity are "educating" the youth of West Germany. Just as there are often child murder cases in the United States, West Germany now also often has young people secretly forming societies to engage in profiteering and murder, because movie theaters showing American films have become their schools, and detective novels have become their textbooks.

　　This person from Nuremberg spoke eloquently, and the various sufferings of the people in West Germany under the enslavement of American imperialists immediately silenced this joyful scene. But his tone was not permanently so low. When he reached a certain point, his spirit suddenly became excited:

　　"But I can tell you that West Germany cannot continue like this for long; the forces of peace and democracy are growing. Let me use a common Chinese analogy. American imperialism is a paper tiger, and when it rains, this paper tiger is finished. Now I tell you, it's about to start raining in West Germany."

　　As he said this, a people's policeman brought in a guest with a dark, thin face, black hair, and wearing black clothes. He could not speak German. After translation, it was learned that he was a representative from Albania, going to Berlin to participate in May Day.

　　Albania is very unfortunate, not having good neighbors. To the east is Greece, ruled by American puppet royalist fascists, and to the north is Yugoslavia, ruled by the American spy Tito group. Therefore, the entry and exit of the Albanian people is greatly restricted. This Albanian friend had to go a long way around through Czechoslovakia before arriving in Dresden. The entire audience expressed excitement and gratitude for his unexpected appearance, and they all stood up to pay their respects to him and toast him. A smile appeared on his face as if he had arrived home.

　　In this evening party, the Free German Youth Choir's chorus was interspersed, and everyone was joyful for tomorrow's May Day. Tomorrow, from Guangzhou to Berlin, there will be eight hundred million people in different cities and villages, celebrating their common May Day in different languages, unlike before, when, apart from the Soviet Union, most people in this region spent their May Day under the repression of reactionary governments or in prisons.

### 五一前夕在德累斯顿

　　五一前夕在德累斯顿
    冯至
    四月三十日下午四时，我们从柏林出发，坐汽车到德累斯顿去，准备参加那里五一节的群众大会。这条汽车大路不经过任何乡村，任何城市，也没有和它交插的道路，只是一直通到德累斯顿。这是纳粹时代的建筑，当时建筑的目的，与其说是为了交通，倒不如说是为了侵略。一九三九年三月纳粹匪徒阴谋而无耻地占领了捷克全部，自然是从这里进军的；但他们作梦也不会想到，一九四五年五月柏林前线的苏军奉到斯大林的指令，抽出一部分坦克部队驰援陷入危机的捷克人民军，解放捷克首都布拉格，也是从这条路迅速赶到的。如今已经看不出多少战争的痕迹了，只有几座桥梁被炸毁，换上临时性的木桥，此外还偶尔有一两架破烂的机器躺在路旁，身上生满黄锈，没人理会。碧野里疏疏落落点缀着红瓦顶的房屋，平静而单调，我坐在车里只想着昨天看到的柏林。
    我们是昨天下午从莫斯科飞到柏林的。莫斯科正是一连串的好天气，人们为了迎接五一，每座建筑都在被刷新，刷新了又被修饰，用文字，用旗帜，用列宁斯大林的像。玻璃窗都擦得亮亮的，克里姆宫的绿色瓦顶也打扫得一尘不染。但我们一到柏林，正是一个阴沉的下午，没有太阳，气候比莫斯科还冷，走入市区，是惊人的冷静。几条往日最繁华的大街两旁不是烧剩下的墙壁，便是一片空场堆积着砖瓦。我们在台尔曼广场旁的旅馆门前下了车，招待我们的人指着广场对面一片废墟说，这就是当年希特勒发号施令的地方，也是他的葬身之所。可是当我们晚饭后到运输工会参加一个小规模的庆祝会时，情形就大不相同了。里边在欢呼，在歌唱，十几个劳动英雄在被表扬。我们从辽远的中华人民共和国来的客人一走进大厅，便被他们团团围住。他们是运输工人，由于他们的工作是很容易连系到远方的。“向胜利的中国致敬！”“向毛泽东致敬！”呼喊不停，在各样的口号中也参杂着“向西欧拒运战争物资的运输工人致敬！”我们最受感动的，是两个青年从我们一来就跟在我们身边，“替我们问候中国青年！”重复了十几遍，最后我们走出门外，上了汽车，他们还隔着车窗叮咛嘱咐：“问候中国的青年！”
    这是一个大的转变。街旁的那些瓦砾里掩埋了希特勒时代的罪恶，这里却充满了和平气氛，工人和青年充分表现出建设的热情和国际主义的精神。从运输工会回来的路上，同车的德国朋友问我：
    “你对于柏林初步的印象怎样？”
    “柏林破坏得太厉害了；德国的人民却大大地进步了，这证明统一社会党在领导上发生了很大的作用。”
    “只要德国的人民进步了，能够列入以苏联为首的和平阵营，付与这么多的代价也是值得的。”他说话时用手指着街旁的废墟。
    在这单调的汽车大路上我不住思索着昨晚的这段谈话，同车的一个德国青年向我们谈起德累斯顿：
    “德累斯顿的新城还完好，旧城却大部分炸毁了，尤其是文化建筑的区域。这是在希特勒匪徒们眼看就要投降，苏军距离德累斯顿只有几公里时被美国的飞机在一夜里炸掉的，那夜正赶上从布莱斯劳退下来大批的难民，麇集在街旁和广场上，在轰炸中死伤了三十五万——”
    “三万五千？”我不相信那个数目，我以为听错了，事实上也许是三万五千。
    “三十五万！”他接着说下去，“这次轰炸是不必要的，因为德累斯顿眼看就要解放了。美国的飞机不只一次，每逢苏军临近一座文化上或工业上重要的城市，就先把它炸掉，不让一座城完好地落在苏军手里——人民的手里。同时也给苏军在解放那座城市后增加许多善后的困难。”
    我立即想到苏军将要向日本宣战时，美国为什么要赶快在广岛和长崎投下原子弹，这与轰炸德累斯顿形式上虽不完全相同，本质上却是由于同样的阴谋。
    “我们姑且抛开德累斯顿不谈，因为那时的德累斯顿，还是纳粹德国的德累斯顿，不管美国的用心是对付敌人纳粹，还是对付盟友苏联，表面上还是说得下去的。至于捷克呢，它是被纳粹侵略的国家，多少捷克的爱国人士有的在国外盟国的军队中作战，有的在国内作坚强的反法西斯的斗争，而在眼看就快要解放的时期，它的重要的工厂，如斯廓达工厂，拔佳鞋厂，都遭受过美国飞机的轰炸。这是很显然的，这时美国的飞机绝不是在对付纳粹，却是对付自己的盟友了，它在为美国垄断资本家战后的市场着想，来毁灭捷克最重要的工业。”
    “如今怎样了呢，”我说，“那些想毁灭他人来养肥自己的纳粹匪徒们已经埋葬在废墟中，东欧被他们侵略过的国家都在努力建设，向着社会主义突飞猛进。可怜美国的垄断资本家们却穷极无聊，一步步走上法西斯的死路。”
    傍晚时到了德累斯顿。易北河北岸的新城果然完好，但是走过奥古斯特桥，旧城的一切建筑，文艺复兴体的王宫，巴洛克体的宽广的瓮城，以收藏古典绘图驰名的画廊都成为一片瓦砾。从前德累斯顿的游人往往要在那些地方消磨许多时间，如今我们只是坐着汽车迅速走过，所看到的是这里倒着一座石像，那里剩下一段颓垣。
    我们到了工会招待所，和昨晚在运输工会里一样，又是一次热诚的欢迎。里边有工会干部，模范工人，自由德国青年歌咏队，新闻记者和政府里的负责人。大家一握手便像是多年未见面的朋友一般；彼此关心生活，关心建设，三言两语便谈到海南岛的解放，苏联对于德国人民的帮助，他们问我们的台湾西藏，我们问他们的西德和西柏林，再谈下去就谈到毛主席的“论人民民主专政”和刘副主席的“论国际主义与民族主义”。
    “这两篇文章，”一位社会统一党的重要干部向我们说，“已经是我们党里学习的重要文件。我们过去学习马列主义过于抽象，不连系实际，因此造成一九三三年惨痛的失败。这些文件可以给我们不少的启发，给我们解决不少的问题。”
    事实上现在德国的情况和中国是有类似的地方，西德的波恩傀儡政府不就等于蒋介石匪帮，美帝国主义过去所加之于中国的现在不是正加紧地加之于西德吗？于是我们表示，希望德国迅速统一，迅速把美帝国主义者赶出去，像我们把他们从中国领土上赶出去一样。
    和我们同来的波兰代表也沉痛而有力地说：“德国法西斯把全波兰的城市与建筑破坏了百分之八十五。但现在我可以告慰德国人民的，是波兰仍然存在。只要两国的劳动人民携了手，一切纷争都会消除了，更不必说战争了。”这使我想起斯大林的名言，“希特勒匪徒们来了又去了，德国人民和德国永久存在着”。一切与人民为敌的反动者们，好好听取这句话吧！
    在这些人中间也有从西德来的，有的从纽仑堡，有的从萨尔区，他们受了西德工人的嘱托，来问候祖国的工人。是的，西德已经成了英美帝国主义的殖民地，他们来到德意志民主共和国，就是回到自由的祖国。西德的人民在马歇尔计划的影响下苦难一天比一天加深。大城市商店的陈列窗里陈列着美国的商品，形成表面的繁荣，工人的失业数目却日渐增长，现在正从二百五十万升到三百万。不合理的现象到处都是，那位纽仑堡来的代表说出许多具体的事实：
    皮鞋工厂里制造出来的皮鞋无处倾销，美国的皮鞋却充满了市面。
    美国的乳酪大批运到德国，德国人无力购买，堆积在货房里都发霉腐烂了。政府在救济失业工人时却把这些腐烂的乳酪买下来发给失业的工人。工人领到手里问，“我们拿着这些乳酪有什么用呢？”回答是：“你们把它在市上卖掉，所得的钱不就等于救济金吗？”
    并且美国的侦探小说和诲盗诲淫的电影在“教育”着西德的青年。正如在美国常常有儿童杀人案件发生一般，西德现在也常有青年秘密结社来干些图财害命的勾当了，因为演美国影片的电影场成了他们的学校，侦探小说成了他们的教科书。
    这个纽仑堡人谈起话来是娓娓动听，西德人民在美帝国主义者奴役下的种种苦难使这欢乐的场面立即沉静下去。但他的语调并不永久是这样低沉，说到一个阶段时，他的精神忽然兴奋起来：
    “不过我可以告诉你们，西德不能这样长久下去的，和平与民主的力量在滋长。我说一个中国人常爱说的比喻吧，美帝国主义是个纸老虎，一下雨这纸老虎就完了。现在我告诉你们，在西德已经快开始下雨了。”
    说到这里，人民警察带进来一个客人，黑瘦的面貌，黑色的头发，穿着一身黑衣服，不会说德国话，经过翻译才知道是阿尔巴尼亚的代表，要到柏林去参加五一。
    阿尔巴尼亚很不幸，没有得到好邻居，东边是美国傀儡保皇法西斯统制着的希腊，北边是美国间谍铁托集团所统制的南斯拉夫。因此阿尔巴尼亚人民的出入就受了很大的限制，这位阿尔巴尼亚的友人不得不绕很大的一个圈子才经过捷克才到了德累斯顿。对于他的意想不到的出现全场的主客表示出兴奋和感谢，于是都起来向他致敬，向他敬酒，他的脸上也显露出好像到了家了似的笑容。
    在这晚会中，中间参杂着自由德国青年歌咏团的合唱，人人都为了明天的五一欢悦。明天从广州到柏林将有八万万人口在不同的城市和村庄，用不同的语言庆祝他们共同的五一，不会像从前，除去苏联外，这区域里的大部分人只是在反动政府的压制下，或是在监狱里度过他们的五一了。
