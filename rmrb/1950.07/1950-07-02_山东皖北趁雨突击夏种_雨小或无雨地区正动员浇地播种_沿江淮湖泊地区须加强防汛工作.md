*Liberation Daily* News: Most areas in East China have recently received timely rainfall. Shandong, northern Anhui, and other places are vigorously organizing farmers to seize the opportunity to rush summer weeding and summer planting. In Shandong Province, on the 17th and 18th, in the vast areas from Dongguang in the north to Xuzhou in the south, and Changyi and Weifang in the east, except for some areas, there was widespread welcome rain. The farmers were overjoyed and are striving to rush summer planting. In the Tai'an area, including Tai'an, Tai'ning, Wenshang, Dongping counties, and parts of Xin'tai and Laiwu, there was continuous heavy rain on the 17th and 18th, with sufficient rainfall for summer planting. After the rain, farmers are actively sowing corn, beans, and planting sweet potatoes. Areas with little or no rain are also mobilizing farmers to irrigate or carry water to sow. In most areas of the Huimin area, there was heavy rain on the 18th. In Yangxin, Huimin, Putai, and Qidong counties, the rainfall penetrated the soil to the depth of a plough. In other counties, some areas also had rainfall that penetrated the soil, while other areas had about two or three finger-widths of rain. Most areas in the whole area can be planted. On the 18th, in Dezhou area, including Deping, Dongguang, and other six counties, there was also widespread heavy rain that penetrated the soil to the depth of a plough. There was no rain in Pingyuan and other counties. In Lincheng, Huashan, Xuzhou, and other places, there was penetrating rain on the 17th. The Lincheng County Party Committee held an emergency meeting at 9:00 am on the 18th, deciding to immediately draw out government cadres to help various districts quickly rush summer planting, and instructed all districts to stop all meetings and work that can be postponed, and to go all out to rush planting. It demanded that after this rain, all beans and sweet potatoes must be planted. The instructions also emphasized: In the rush planting, it is necessary to carefully check and solve the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, workers' families, and households without labor, so as to ensure that they can plant quickly. The Huashan County Party Committee also held a temporary meeting on the morning of the day after the rain, to study the work of rushing summer planting, and decided that County Head Zhao and two ministers of the County Party Committee, and two section chiefs of the County Government, would lead 30 cadres to various districts to help rush planting. The Changwei area also had widespread rainfall on the 18th, but the rainfall was relatively small, only about two or three finger-widths deep. Since the wheat harvest, some areas have shown signs of drought, which not only affected summer planting, but also made spring seedlings weak. This rainfall not only allows summer planting to be completed early, but also greatly strikes some spring seedling pests (such as cotton aphids).

In the northern Anhui region, including Lu'an, Chaohu, Fuyang, and Suxian, rain has fallen successively. In Jinzhai County, Lu'an area, there was widespread rain from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm on the 21st, and the ponds were half full, which can be used for replanting (Mapu district cannot yet transplant rice seedlings); on the same afternoon, in Shucheng County, in the four districts of Gancha Lake, Nangang, Zhangmu Bridge, and Taoxi, there was widespread rain of about four inches, and the dry land can be plowed and planted, and the paddy fields can also be transplanted. In Meihe, He Basin, Xiao Da and other districts, there was also about three-tenths of an inch of rain; in Lu'an, Huoqiu, and Shou counties, there was light rain on the same day, among which, except for the Mao Tan Chang and Zhangjia Dian districts of Lu'an County where the rainfall was slightly larger and the land could be plowed, in general, the rainfall was too small to solve any problems (according to the farm statistics, the rainfall in Lu'an that day was only three millimeters).

Chaoxian County also had rain from the night of the 21st to the whole day of the 22nd, but the rainfall was small. Hefei had rain for about two hours on the afternoon of the 22nd. After the rain, the drought no longer exists in some places, and can be缓和(huǎnhé: alleviated) in some places, but the drought still exists in some areas. For this reason, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office issued a telegram on the 22nd, instructing all localities: In areas with rain, governments at all levels should seize the leadership to lead the masses to rush planting and rush weeding, so as not to miss the opportunity. It is also necessary to formulate reasonable water usage methods to prevent water usage disputes and waste of water resources. Areas without rain or with very little rain should continue to carry out drought resistance work with all their strength, and should not have negative ideas of waiting for rain. Areas along the Yangtze River, Huai River, and lakes should strengthen flood prevention work to prevent floods.

　　山东皖北趁雨突击夏种
    雨小或无雨地区正动员浇地播种  沿江淮湖泊地区须加强防汛工作
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：华东大部地区近来普降时雨，山东、皖北等地大力组织农民抓紧时机突击夏锄、夏种。山东省十七、十八两日，北至东光、南至徐州、东至昌潍一带的广大地区内，除部分地区外均普降喜雨，农民们欢喜万分，均在奋力突击夏种。泰安专区之泰安、泰宁、汶上、东平等县和新泰、莱芜的一部分地区，十七、十八两日连日大雨，雨量足够夏种之用。雨后，农民均积极播种苞米、豆子及栽地瓜，雨小或无雨地区亦正动员农民浇地或挑水播种。惠民专区大部地区十八日普降大雨，阳信、惠民、蒲台、齐东等县，雨量透犁，其他县分亦有部分地区透犁，部分地区约有二、三指雨，全区大部分地区均可进行播种。十八日德州专区之德平、东光等六县，亦普降透犁大雨，平原等县无雨。临城、华山、徐州等地，均于十七日普落透雨。临城县委于十八日上午九时，召开紧急会议，决定立即抽出机关干部，帮助各区迅速突击夏种，并指示各区停止一切会议及可以缓办的工作，全力进行抢种，要求这场雨后，要全部种上豆子、地瓜。指示中并强调指出：在抢种中，要认真检查和解决烈、军、工属及无劳力户的困难，务使他们迅速种上。华山县委亦于落雨后之次日清晨，召开临时会议，研究突击夏种工作，决定由赵县长及县委两个部长、县府两个科长带领三十名干部，分赴各区帮助突击。昌潍专区亦于十八日普遍降雨，惟雨量较小，不过二、三指深。自麦收以来，若干地区即呈旱象，不仅影响夏种，春苗亦不旺盛，这次降雨，不仅可使夏种及早完成，并使某些春苗害虫（如棉蚜）遭到极大打击。
    皖北区六安、巢湖、阜阳、宿县各地已陆续下雨。六安专区金寨县二十一日下午五时至六时，普遍下雨，塘水半满，可以进行补种（麻埠区尚不能栽秧）；同日下午舒城县干汊湖、南港、张母桥、桃溪等四个区，普遍下雨四寸左右，旱地已可犁可种，水田亦可栽秧。梅河、河盆、晓大等区，亦下雨三分左右；六安、霍邱、寿县三县，于同日落小雨，其中除六安县之毛坦厂、张家店两区雨量稍大，可以犁田外，一般因雨量太小，还解决不了什么问题（据农场统计，六安当日雨量只有三公厘）。
    巢县亦于二十一日夜至二十二日整日下雨，但雨量较小。合肥于二十二日下午下雨约两小时。下雨后，有些地方旱象已不存在，有些地方也可缓和，但是，部分地区旱象仍存在，为此，皖北行署特于二十二日发出代电。指示各地：下雨地区，各级人民政府应抓紧领导群众抢种抢锄，以免贻误时机。并须订出合理使水办法，防止使水纠纷及浪费水源。未下雨或雨量甚小地区，仍应全力进行抗旱工作，不能有消极等雨思想。沿长江、淮河及湖泊地区，则应加强防汛工作，以防水灾。
