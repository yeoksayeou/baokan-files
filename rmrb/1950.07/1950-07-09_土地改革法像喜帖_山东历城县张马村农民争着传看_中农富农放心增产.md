Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 7th: A *Dazhong Daily* newspaper containing the Land Reform Law has arrived in Zhangma Village, Licheng County, like a wedding invitation. The farmers in the village are vying to read it and asking the village work cadres to explain it to them. The whole village is buzzing with excitement, as if a great happy event has occurred, and everyone is talking about the Land Reform Law.

The poor peasant Zeng Xianliang, who was doing odd jobs for others, immediately found the village cadres to ask about the content of the Land Reform Law when he heard the news of its promulgation. He said, "I've been looking forward to this every day, and today it has finally come true. I bought 500 jin of manure in the spring, ready to use after the land is distributed. In the future, my family of five or six will no longer have to just cultivate nine fen of land." The poor peasant Zhao Xuncai said, "For several years, I've been hoping that the Communist Party would come and distribute some land. My ancestors have been poor farmers for generations, barely scraping by. My father and his three brothers divided the family property and got seven li of land. My three brothers and I still have seven li of land. Besides doing odd jobs, the whole family has to 'rest their teeth' on rainy days and cloudy days. This time, we finally have hope!" All the farmers believe that now that there are regulations, land reform will be implemented in the village this autumn. It is even more important to further encourage and supervise landlords to work, and prevent them from transferring land and destroying draught animals and farm implements.

The middle peasant Zeng Xianyuan said, "In the past, although I heard that middle peasants would not be touched, I was never really at ease. After reading the Land Reform Law this time, I can finally feel completely at ease." The well-to-do middle peasant Zhao Changqing also said, "This Land Reform Law allows everyone to have land to cultivate and live a good life. Who wouldn't be happy and support it? In the past, I thought that land reform had nothing to do with middle peasants, and I didn't pay much attention to it. After reading the Land Reform Law this time, I realized that land reform is not just a matter for poor peasants, but a major matter for all farmers."

The rich peasant Liu Zhengang's past statement on planting and fertilizing was: "Crops grow the same whether the land has fertilizer or not." After hearing about the Land Reform Law this time, he immediately changed his tune. He said, "Crops definitely won't grow if the land doesn't have fertilizer!" After seeing Vice Chairman Liu's report on the "May 1st" Labor Day, he bought 200 jin of soybean cakes and bought a pig to accumulate manure. Now he is planning to sell the calf and replace it with a big ox. After reading the Land Reform Law, the rich peasant Wu Zhichuan bought 200 jin of soybean cakes the next day and prepared to fertilize the land.

According to the situation in some rural areas along the Jiaoji Railway and the Jinpu Railway, which were liberated in the second half of 1948 in Shandong, land reform has not yet been implemented. The local poor peasants urgently demanded land and had repeatedly requested the government to lead them in carrying out land reform, but the government had explained that it would be temporarily suspended. The promulgation of the Land Reform Law this time has encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers in these areas.

### 土地改革法像喜帖  山东历城县张马村农民争着传看  中农富农放心增产

　　土地改革法像喜帖
    山东历城县张马村农民争着传看 
    中农富农放心增产
    【新华社济南七日电】刊载着土地改地法的一张大众日报，像一张喜帖一样地传到了历城县的张马村。该村农民争相传阅，要求村里的工作干部给他们解释。全村农民像有了大喜事一样地活跃起来，到处谈论着土地改革法。
    贫农曾献亮在给别人帮短工，听到土地改革法公布的消息，马上就找到村干部问土地改革法的内容。他说：“天天盼，今天可真盼到了。我在春天就买下了大粪五百斤，准备分地后用。这以后我家五六口人，再不能光种九分地了。”贫农赵训才说：“几年来就盼共产党来了分点地。俺两三辈子都是属小鸡的，刨扯着吃。俺父亲弟兄四个分家，分了七厘地。俺这辈兄弟三个还是七厘地，除卖短工外，全家下雨阴天时就得‘歇牙’。这回算是有了盼头啦！”所有农民都认为：现在有了章程，本村今年秋后就要实行土地改革，更要进一步鼓励和督促地主劳动，防止他们移转土地和破坏耕畜、农具。
    该村中农曾献元说：“过去虽听说不动中农，可是心里总不这样踏实。这回看了土地改革法可算放心到底了。”富裕中农赵长庆也说：“这个土地改革法叫人人有地种，都过好日子，那个不欢喜、拥护？我过去认为土地改革没有中农的事，对土改不大关心。这回看了土地改革法才明白，土地改革不光是贫农的事，是农民大伙的大事。”
    富农刘振刚过去对种地施肥的论调是：“地没粪庄稼一样长”；这次他听了土地改革法后，立刻变了说法。他说：“地里没肥庄稼可不长！”他在看到“五一”劳动节刘副主席的报告后，就买了二百斤豆饼，又买了一只猪准备积肥。现在他又计划把小牛卖了换成大牛。富农吴指川看了土地改革法，第二天就买了二百斤豆饼，准备往地里施肥。
    按山东一九四八年下半年所解放的胶济铁路和津浦铁路沿线部分农村，尚未实行土地改革。当地贫农迫切要求土地，曾几次请求政府领导他们进行土地改革，均经政府解释暂停。这次土地改革法的颁布，鼓舞了这些地区广大农民的生产情绪。
