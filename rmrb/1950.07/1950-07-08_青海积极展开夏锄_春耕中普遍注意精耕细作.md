Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 6th: Qinghai Province has successfully concluded its spring planting work. The areas that planted earlier have generally already weeded once. Due to the cold climate in the province, the planting season is relatively late, and it was only at the beginning of last month that crops such as highland barley, oats, and rapeseed were largely planted.

During the spring planting, people's governments at all levels convened farmer representative meetings and people's representative meetings of all ethnic groups to deeply publicize production policies and eliminate various concerns of farmers of all ethnic groups regarding the development of production. Many county and district leading cadres personally went to the countryside to lead production or dispatched work teams to help farmers with spring planting. At the same time, based on the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program, people's governments at all levels resolved some land disputes between Hui and Han people, mobilizing farmers of all ethnic groups to unite and help each other in production. For example, in ten counties including Datong, more than 33,000 stones of seeds were adjusted among farmers of all ethnic groups, solving the difficulties of poor farmers who lacked seeds.

After the above series of work, the enthusiasm of the masses of farmers for production has greatly increased, and they have expanded their cultivated land area and paid attention to intensive and careful farming. For example, in the past, fallow land (dry land cultivated for three years and left fallow for one year) accounted for about 30% of the total cultivated land area in the province, but this year it has been reduced to 20% (about 400,000 mu). Also, in the past, land was not plowed before sowing, but this year, it is generally plowed before sowing. In addition, the amount of fertilizer applied has also increased by 15% to 20% compared with previous years, and water conservancy projects have also increased the province's paddy fields by about 80,000 mu. In addition, in order to solve the difficulty of labor shortages, farmers in various counties have further organized themselves on the basis of the original labor exchange and mutual assistance to carry out production. More than 30,000 farmers have been organized in Mutual Assistance County. Currently, farmers throughout the province are actively launching a summer weeding campaign.

　　青海积极展开夏锄
    春耕中普遍注意精耕细作
    【新华社西安六日电】青海全省春耕播种工作已顺利结束。播种较早的地区一般且已锄过一次草。该省因气候寒冷，播种季节较迟，至上月初时，青稞、燕麦、菜籽等作物才大体播种完毕。
    在春耕播种中，各县人民政府都先后召开了农民代表会议和各族各界人民代表会议，深入宣传了生产政策，消除了各族农民对于发展生产的各种顾虑。不少县、区领导干部并亲自下乡领导生产，或派遣工作组帮助农民进行春耕播种。同时，各县人民政府又根据共同纲领上所规定的民族政策，解决了某些回、汉民之间的土地纠纷，发动各族农民团结互助进行生产。如大通等十个县各族农民间共调剂了三万三千余石种籽，解决了贫苦农民群众缺种的困难。
    经过了上述一系列的工作，农民群众的生产情绪大为提高，纷纷扩大耕地面积并注意精耕细作。如全省过去歇地（旱地耕三年歇一年）约占总耕地面积百分之三十，今年即降低为百分之二十（约有四十万亩）。又如过去下种时不翻地，今年则普遍先翻后种。其他如施肥量也较往年增加百分之十五到二十，兴修水利也使全省约增加八万亩水田。此外，为了解决劳力缺乏的困难，各县农民又纷纷在原有的变工互助基础上，进一步组织起来，进行生产。互助县组织起来的农民即达三万余人。现全省农民正积极展开夏锄运动。
