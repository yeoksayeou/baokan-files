(Shenyang News) The Northeast Daily reports: Cement factories under the Construction Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department have made remarkable achievements in improving quality and reducing costs through a year and a half of efforts. According to tests conducted by the Dalian Scientific Research Institute, the Northeast Scientific Research Institute, and the Harbin Institute of Technology, the quality of cement from the factories under the bureau has completely overcome serious shortcomings such as flash setting and insufficient compressive and flexural strength since June of last year. It generally exceeds the specifications set by the Northeast Industry Department and nearly doubles the standards of the puppet Manchurian regime. High-grade cement produced by various factories has a compressive strength of up to 750 kilograms per cubic centimeter after 28 days of production, exceeding the Japanese-puppet standard specifications by 150 kilograms, and has no cracking, bulging, or distortion. This type of cement is of high quality and low cost, and the allocation price is more than half lower than the market price of cement in other regions of China. The actual cost of cement from the bureau has been reduced by an average of 30% compared to last year. The production efficiency of various factories has also rapidly increased. During the puppet Manchurian regime, large rotary kilns could only be used for 25 days before requiring repairs. Now, various factories have generally surpassed the puppet Manchurian standard, with the Xiaotun Cement Factory creating a record of 68 days. Calculated by total production efficiency, this year is 30% higher than last year. Calculated by total output, this year is more than double last year. From January to May of this year, the half-year production plan has been fully completed.

At the beginning of last year, the quality of cement produced by the factory was very low, with compressive and flexural strength only reaching half of the puppet Manchurian standard specifications. The bureau immediately seized this key issue, organized technicians and workers to conduct research, sent people to the Dalian Cement Factory to learn, and consulted the Dalian Scientific Research Institute, the Northeast Scientific Research Institute, and the Harbin Institute of Technology. After much research, the reasons for the poor cement quality were identified: too many impurities in the raw materials, improper batching, poor coal quality, and excessive moisture content. In response to the above shortcomings, improved methods were further sought. This leadership method of "grasping key problems" and pursuing them to the end until they are resolved is the main reason why the bureau has achieved production success.

　　抓住关键问题逐一解决
    东北提高水泥质量
    成本较去年降低十分之三
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北人民政府工业部建筑工业管理局所属水泥各厂，经一年半来的努力，在提高质量降低成本上已取得卓越的成绩。根据大连科学研究所、东北科学研究所、哈尔滨工业大学的试验结果，该局所属各厂水泥质量自去年六月份以后，即完全克服了急结，耐压力、抗折力不够等的严重缺点，普遍超过东北工业部所订规格，超过伪满标准规格近两倍。各厂所出高级水泥，每立方公分作出后二十八天的耐压力，高达七百五十公斤，超过日伪标准规格一百五十公斤，且无破裂、凸涨、歪曲现象。此种水泥质量高，成本低，调拨价较关内水泥市场出售价低过一倍以上。该局水泥实际成本较去年平均降低百分之三十。各厂生产效率亦迅速提高，伪满时大回转窑只能用二十五天就必须检修，现在各厂已普遍突破伪满标准，小屯水泥厂则创造了六十八天的最高纪录。以总生产效能计算，今年比去年提高百分之三十。以总产量计算，今年比去年提高一倍多。今年一月至五月，已全部完成半年生产计划。
    去年年初，该厂水泥质量很低，耐压和抗折力仅达伪满标准规格的一半。该局当即抓住这一关键，组织技术人员和工人从事研究，派人到大连水泥厂去学习，并向大连科学研究所、东北科学研究所、哈尔滨工业大学去请教，经多方研究，找出了水泥质量不好的原因，是原料杂质太多、配料成份不当、煤质不良、水分过高。针对以上缺点，进一步又求得了改进的办法。此种“抓住关键问题”穷追到底，不解决不罢休的领导生产方法，是该局获得生产成绩的主要原因。
