　　Summer Grain Collection Work Fully Unfolded in the Four Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi in Central and Southern China
　　Some Areas Have Completed Warehousing Tasks
　　[Our Newspaper HANKOU News] In the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi in Central and Southern China, people's representatives' conferences, farmer representatives' meetings, and cadre meetings have been held successively in various counties to convey and study the summer grain collection policies, burden methods, and allocate burden tasks. Now the summer grain collection has been fully unfolded, and some areas have completed the warehousing tasks. In Henan Province, the burden was completely allocated to households from June 20th to the beginning of July. It is estimated that most areas may complete the collection task by the end of July, and they are now generally entering the warehousing stage. As of now, the Luoyang area has completed more than 80% of the warehousing, and individual counties such as Mengjin, Xin'an, and Luoyang have all completed the warehousing task. All areas can complete it before August 5th at the latest. Many areas in Hubei, such as some villages in Qianjiang County, have completed the task, and the Luoyangdian District of Sui County has overfulfilled the task. Various counties in Guangdong are currently arranging tasks for districts and townships. Farmers are currently reporting land and assessing yields. All tasks can be allocated to households by the end of July. Warehousing will begin in mid-August, and can be completed by early September. Guangxi has arranged the summer grain collection as a key task, combined with the clearing of arrears from the end of 1949. Collection will begin in early August, and it is expected that the warehousing task will be completed by the end of August.
　　In the collection process, all regions have fully utilized farmer representatives' meetings to implement the anti-concealed land and yield assessment, in order to fully complete the summer grain collection. The Zhangguanying District of Lushan County held three farmer representatives' meetings to implement the spirit of the county and district representatives' meeting, stipulated the method for dividing the township's economic zones, and assessed the standard yields, so that villages and households reported and discussed publicly, and then collected mass feedback to revise the excessively light or heavy phenomena of individual households. Yu County, through the farmer representatives' meeting to oppose concealed land, enlightened the farmers' class consciousness, making them understand that: "If one household conceals land, everyone suffers," and then called on the representatives to report the actual land. For example, under the leadership of representatives and activists, 14 townships in the Niutang District reported 4,920 mu of concealed land. In this way, various regions mobilized the masses to squeeze out a large amount of concealed land, and further implemented the burden policy.
　　Through extensive and in-depth publicity and education, the enthusiasm of farmers for paying public grain has been improved. Especially in Henan, the farmers in the areas that have undergone land reform are even more enthusiastic. For example, the masses in Xincai dried their wheat three times and asked to put it into storage. Some masses said to the cadres when they met: "My grain is ready and waiting to be handed in!" Therefore, Mengjin, Xin'an, Luoyang and other places quickly completed the warehousing tasks.
　　At present, many areas in Henan and Hubei have begun or are entering the warehousing stage. Farmers are actively and enthusiastically delivering public grain, and leaders and grain workers at all levels also attach great importance to the warehousing work. For example, the Henan Provincial Government instructed all its subordinate areas to organize and plan the warehousing of public grain to prevent losses. All regions have implemented this instruction.
　　In the summer grain collection work in individual areas, some deviations have occurred, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, in some areas of Henan, yields were not assessed based on the natural conditions and management conditions of the land, but were assessed according to tasks or according to the quality of crops; some areas failed to conduct in-depth publicity, and cadres had a purely task-oriented view, fearing trouble, resulting in excessively light or heavy burdens; some villages had localism ideas, underreporting land and yields, causing unfair burden sharing. The above deviations have attracted the attention of various regions and are being corrected. In areas where inspections and corrections have been carried out, cadres' confidence in completing tasks has been enhanced, and the enthusiasm of the masses for delivering grain has also increased. It can be seen that continuous correction of deviations by governments at all levels in the summer grain collection is an important link to ensure the completion of tasks.
　　In addition, some leaders and warehouse cadres do not pay enough attention to the warehousing and storage of public grain, and some cadres are too paralyzed in their thinking, causing serious losses. For example, more than 800 jin of public grain was robbed by special agents in a village in the Fengwang District of Xinyang. All regions should be highly vigilant.

### 中南区豫鄂粤桂四省  夏征工作全面展开  部分地区完成入仓任务

　　中南区豫鄂粤桂四省
    夏征工作全面展开           
    部分地区完成入仓任务
    【本报汉口讯】中南区河南、湖北、广东、广西四省各县，先后召开了各界人民代表会议、农民代表会和干部会，传达、研究夏征政策、负担办法，分配负担任务。现在夏征已全面展开，部分地区并已完成入库任务。河南省于六月二十日至七月初即全部把负担分配到户，估计七月底大部地区可能完成征收任务，现正普遍进入入仓阶段。截至目前为止，洛阳专区入仓已达百分之八十以上，个别县如孟津、新安、洛阳均已全部完成入库任务。各地最晚可在八月五日以前全部完成。湖北不少地区如潜江县部分村已完成了任务，随县洛阳店区已超额完成任务。广东各县正在向区、乡布置任务，目前农民正在报地亩，评产量，七月底可全部把任务分配到户里去，八月中开始入仓，九月上旬可全部完成。广西夏征为重点布置，结合清理一九四九年尾欠，于八月初开始征收，预计八月底可完成入仓任务。
    各地在征收中，都充分运用了农代会，贯彻反黑地、评产量，以全力完成夏征。鲁山张官营区召开了三次农代会议，贯彻了县区代表会决议的精神，规定出全乡经济区划分的办法，评议出标准产量，使村与村、户与户自报公议，并公布出去，然后收集群众反映，修改个别户的畸轻畸重现象。禹县通过农代会反黑地，启发了农民的阶级觉悟，使其明了：“一户瞒田大家吃亏”，然后号召代表报实田亩。如牛堂区有十四个乡在各代表、积极分子带头之下，即报出黑地四千九百二十亩。各地就这样发动群众挤出了大批黑地，进一步贯彻了负担政策。
    经过广泛深入的宣传教育，提高了农民的交纳公粮的情绪。特别是河南经过土地改革地区的农民，情绪更高。如新蔡群众将麦子晒了三遍要求入仓。有的群众碰到干部见面就说：“我的粮已准备好啦，等着交哩！”，因此孟津、新安、洛阳等地都很快地完成了入仓任务。
    目前河南和湖北不少地区开始或正在进入入仓阶段。农民积极踊跃地送交公粮，各级领导和粮食工作者，也十分重视入仓工作。如河南省府指示所属各地，对公粮入库要做到有组织、有计划，以防止损失。各地已根据这一指示贯彻执行中。
    在个别地区夏征工作中，曾发生了一些偏向，引起群众的不满。如河南某些地区不根据土地的自然条件与经营条件评定产量，而按任务评定或按庄稼好坏评定；部分地区未能深入宣传，干部存在着单纯任务观点，怕麻烦，致负担有畸轻畸重现象；某些乡村存在本位思想，少报地亩产量，造成负担轻重不公。以上这些偏向已引起各地注意，正在进行纠正。已检查纠正的地区，干部对完成任务的信心增强了，群众交粮情绪亦高涨起来了。由此可见，各级政府在夏征中不断地纠正偏向，是保证完成任务的重要一环。
    此外，有些领导者和仓库干部，对公粮入库保管重视不够，有些干部思想过于麻痹，造成了严重损失。如信阳冯王区一村被特务抢走的公粮，即有八百余斤。各地应引起高度警惕。
