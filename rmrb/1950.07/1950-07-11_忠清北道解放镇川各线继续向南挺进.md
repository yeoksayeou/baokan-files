Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced in a war report on the evening of the 9th that a unit of the People's Army, pursuing and annihilating the remaining enemy troops in the Cheon County area of northwestern North Chungcheong Province, had liberated Cheon County and its surrounding areas at 9:00 AM on the 8th. In the battle to liberate Cheon, the People's Army killed or wounded over 400 of the remaining Rhee Syngman puppet troops, captured over 200 enemy soldiers, and seized six armored vehicles and a large amount of other war materiel. People's Army units on all fronts are continuing their southward advance, regardless of resistance from U.S. ground forces and air force squadrons.
    
Xinhua News Agency, 10th: U.S. troops continued their humiliating rout in the Battle of Cheonan in Korea. According to an Associated Press report describing the U.S. troop retreat: "As they moved south for miles, their faces showed fatigue, anger, and anxiety. The retreating soldiers who knew what they were doing were able to retreat in an orderly manner at the beginning, but those lagging behind crossed the rice paddies in chaos or climbed onto moving vehicles. Hours after the retreat, no enemy troops were pursuing them. As they fled, North Korean troops fired rotating, deadly shells southward, causing great terror among the U.S. troops."

　　忠清北道解放镇川各线继续向南挺进
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部九日晚发表战报称：在忠清北道西北部镇川县方面追歼残余敌军的人民军某部，已于八日九时解放镇川县城及其附近地区。在解放镇川的战斗中，人民军毙伤李承晚残余伪军四百余名，俘敌二百余名，缴获装甲车六辆及其他战利品甚多。人民军部队在各战线上不顾美国地面部队与空军机群的抵抗，继续南进中。
    【新华社十日讯】美军在朝鲜天安战役中继续狼狈溃逃。据美联社报道美军溃逃时的情形说：“他们在向南方走了数英里时，面上露出疲倦的、愤怒的、紧张不安的气色。撤退的士兵中懂得门道的，在开始时他们还能有秩序地撤退，但是拖在后面的则在混乱中穿越稻田而过，或攀上开行着的汽车。在撤退的几小时以后，还没有敌军追踪他们。他们逃走时，北朝鲜军队以旋转的、致人死命的炮弹向南发射，这在美军中造成了极大的恐怖。”
