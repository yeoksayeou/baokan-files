　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th] The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the morning of the 6th that the vanguard units of the People's Army, after liberating Suwon, continued to advance south to pursue and annihilate the remaining enemy forces. On the evening of the 5th, they encountered the landed American ground troops in the area south of Suwon and immediately engaged in battle. As a result, more than 150 American soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 50 were captured alive. The remaining American troops fled in panic, and the People's Army is continuing its pursuit.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 7th] Reuter, New York: MacArthur's headquarters issued a communique on the 6th admitting that in the battle near Osan on the 5th, American casualties and captured personnel reached 35%. Following the retreat of American troops, the Korean People's Army advanced 12 to 16 kilometers by the 6th. According to unofficial reports, American troops fled southward in one breath for 24 kilometers, and one-third of the land south of the 38th parallel has been liberated by the Korean People's Army. The battle report issued by MacArthur's headquarters copied the old tricks of fascist bandits, saying on the one hand that towns and ports were "still in the hands of the American army," but on the other hand had to formally admit that the People's Army had occupied Pyeongtaek, located at 37 degrees north latitude.

　　According to Pyongyang radio broadcasts, three American ships have been sunk by the Korean People's Navy.

　　While American news agencies described the retreat of the South Korean army as "like a race" (United Press), and "they have completely disintegrated" (Associated Press); they blamed the defeat of the American army on "bad weather," while boasting of the "heroic" "rearguard action" of the American army.

　　The New York Times, in an Associated Press report published on the 6th, revealed that American troops are looting the people in the interior of Korea, even in places where there is no fighting.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th] According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency on the 4th, the People's Guerrilla forces active in the Jiri Mountains of Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, in order to coordinate with the victorious southward advance of the People's Army, have actively launched activities to disrupt the enemy's rear in Jeolla-namdo and Jeolla-bukdo. On the 2nd, with the support of the people, the guerrillas attacked the police substations of Hwangjeon and Byeollyang districts in Suncheon County, Jeolla-namdo, and eliminated all the reactionary police. On the same day, a detachment of the Jiri Mountain guerrilla force attacked the Gucheo District Police Substation in Sunchang County in southern Jeolla-bukdo, and eliminated the reactionary police and special agents.

　　朝鲜人民军胜利打击侵略者
    水原以南歼美军二百余 
    美军向南狼狈溃逃廿四公里
    三八线以南三分之一土地已获解放
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部六日晨发表战报称：解放水原后继续向南挺进追歼残敌的人民军先锋部队，五日晚在水原以南地区与登陆的美军地上部队遭遇，当即展开战斗。结果，毙伤美军一百五十名以上，活捉了五十余名。残余美军仓惶逃窜，人民军刻正继续追击中。
    【新华社七日讯】电通社纽约讯：麦克阿瑟总部六日发表公报承认：五日在乌山附近的战斗中，伤亡和被俘的美军达百分之三十五。朝鲜人民军在美军溃退之后，于六日前进了十二至十六公里。据非官方消息报道：美军则一口气向南逃跑了二十四公里，三八线以南的三分之一土地已被朝鲜人民军解放。麦克阿瑟总部所发表的战报抄袭了法西斯匪徒的故技，一面说城镇和港口“还在美军手里”，一面却又不得不正式承认人民军已占领位于北纬三十七度的平泽。
    据平壤电台广播：美船三艘已被朝鲜人民海军击沉。
    美国的通讯社一面描述南朝鲜军队的溃逃“像赛跑一样”（合众社），而且“他们已完全瓦解”（美联社）；一面却把美军的被击溃归罪于“气候恶劣”，同时吹嘘美军的“英勇的”“后卫行动”。
    纽约时报在六日刊载的美联社报道中透露：美国军队正向朝鲜内地的人民进行抢劫，甚至在没有战事的地方也不可免。
    【新华社平壤六日电】据朝鲜中央社四日消息：活跃在南朝鲜庆尚南道智异山区的人民游击队，为配合人民军的胜利南进已在全罗南北两道积极展开扰乱敌人后方的活动。二日，游击队在人民的支援下，袭击了全罗南道顺天县的黄田、别良两区的警察支署，将反动警察全部肃清。同日，智异山区游击队别动部队又袭击了全罗北道南部的淳昌县龟秋区警察支署，并肃清了反动警察和特务分子。
