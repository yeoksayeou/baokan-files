　　中央各机关和北京市各界节约救灾款物
    内务部已分配给各灾区救济灾民
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府内务部代收中央各机关全体工作人员“一两米”节约救灾款物，自去年八月至今年六月连同前华北人民政府民政部和北京市各界人民救灾委员会所收救灾款物，共计人民币二十七亿一千五百六十三万二千余元，粮食四百一十八万三千一百十四斤，衣物七万六千四百三十五件。这批救灾款物，中央人民政府内务部已根据各地灾害情况，分配给华北、华东、中南、西南、东北、西北等各地灾区救济灾民。各地灾区在收到救灾款物后，均曾致电或写信给中央人民政府内务部，对于中央各机关工作人员和北京市各界人民对他们的关怀，表示感谢。
    中央各机关的“一两米”节约救灾运动于去年八月开始，原定于今年六月底结束。但因各地续有新的灾情发生，经中央机关节约救灾委员会第四次会议决定，自七月份起节约救灾运动再延长三个月。
