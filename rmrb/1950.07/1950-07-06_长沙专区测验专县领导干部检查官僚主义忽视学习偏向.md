Changsha Prefecture Tests Leading Cadres of Zhuan County, Examining Bureaucracy and Neglect of Learning

[This dispatch from Changsha] (By our correspondent Zhang Gancheng, Commissioner of Changsha Prefecture, Hunan): In mid-June, the Changsha Commissioner's Office, taking advantage of the opportunity of convening a political construction conference, organized the county magistrates of various counties attending the meeting, the section chiefs of the Commissioner's Office, the heads of the Prefectural Public Security Office, the Grain Bureau, the Taxation Bureau, and the bank managers, a total of more than 20 people, for a seven-day study period. During the study, the leadership of the prefecture and counties was examined, and finally, a test was conducted.

In this inspection and test, it was found that the leading cadres of various counties and departments of the prefecture had serious bureaucratic and pragmatic work styles, and their learning was very insufficient. The test consisted of ten questions, including policies, situations, current events, and leadership thinking. A total of twenty-three people took the test, all of whom were cadres at or above the county committee level, including three former district committee-level cadres. The shortest period of revolutionary work was seven years, and the longest was twenty years, with the vast majority having more than ten years of experience. The results of the test showed that only eleven people scored sixty points or more, and twelve failed. Among the ten county magistrates and deputy county magistrates, three failed; among the thirteen section chiefs of the Commissioner's Office and responsible cadres of various prefectural units, nine failed.

Most of these leading cadres cannot escape the circle of pragmatism, forming "hardworking" bureaucrats. They are busy all day long, even staying up late into the night. However, they have "no time to read" documents; they do not study or even look at instructions from higher authorities; they can only read the headlines of newspapers, and even the headlines are too much to bother with. They only know how to "bury themselves in work," but they do not know what they will do tomorrow, and they cannot maintain the clear thinking that leaders should have. They cannot comprehensively consider their work, they lack sensitivity to new things, they do not pay attention to the work that has been done, and they do not consider the future of their work, resulting in many avoidable shortcomings and errors in their work. Moreover, in their thinking, most leading cadres consciously or unconsciously put learning in opposition to work, believing that "learning is a personal matter, and work is a revolutionary matter. It is intolerable not to work hard, but it does not matter if one's learning is a little poor." Because leading cadres do not pay attention to learning, lower-level cadres believe even more that "there is no time to study." Therefore, cadre study cannot be carried out for a long time, and even if it is carried out, it cannot be sustained. For example, of the thirty-two cadres who originally participated in the junior and senior primary school classes of the Commissioner's Office's spare-time school, only nine remain now.

Changsha Prefecture has a large area and a population of nearly six million. Over the past year, the work has had a considerable foundation, and order has been restored. Under the new situation, there will be many new tasks and new problems in the future. Therefore, raising the level of leadership thinking, improving working methods, and strengthening theoretical, policy, and professional learning are urgent problems that need to be solved by the leading organs of the prefecture and counties.

### 长沙专区测验专县领导干部检查官僚主义忽视学习偏向

　　长沙专区测验专县领导干部检查官僚主义忽视学习偏向
    【本报长沙讯】湖南长沙专员区专员张干承报道：长沙专署在六月中旬利用召开建政会议的机会，组织到会的各县县长，专署各科长，专区公安处长、粮食局长、税务局长及银行经理等二十余人进行了为期七天的学习，学习中检查了专、县的领导，最后并举行了测验。
    在此次检查与测验中，发现各县与专区各部门的领导干部有严重的官僚主义与事务主义作风，学习很不够。测验共出了十个题，包括政策、情况、时事及领导思想等。参加测验的共二十三人，都是县委级以上的干部，其中尚有原地委级干部三人。参加革命工作最短的有七年，最长的达二十年，绝大多数都在十年以上。测验的结果，得六十分以上的仅十一人，不及格的十二人。其中正、副县长十人中有三人不及格；专署科长及专区各单位负责干部十三人中竟有九人不及格。
    这些领导干部中的大部分人都不能摆脱事务主义的圈子，形成“辛辛苦苦”的官僚主义者。他们终日忙碌，甚至深夜不睡。但是，对文件“无时间看”；对上级指示不研究，甚至不看；对报纸只能看大标题，甚至连大标题也顾不上看。只知道“埋头工作”，可是今天不知道明天要做些什么，不能保持领导者应有的清醒头脑，全面考虑工作，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感；不理会作过了的工作，不考虑工作的前途，以致在工作中产生许多可以避免的缺点和错误。而且，一般领导干部在思想上总是自觉地或不自觉地把学习和工作对立起来，认为“学习是个人问题，工作是革命问题。在工作上不埋头苦干是不能容忍的，而学习差一点没有什么关系”。由于领导干部的不重视学习，下级干部也就更认为“没有时间学习”了。因此干部学习老搞不起来，即使搞起来了也不能坚持。如专署参加机关业余学校初中、高小班学习的干部原有三十二人，到现在仅剩九人了。
    长沙专区地域大，人口近六百万。一年来工作已有相当基础，秩序也已恢复。在新形势下，今后将有许多新的工作与新的问题。因之，提高领导思想水平，改善工作方法，加强理论、政策与业务学习，是目前专、县领导机关急待解决的问题。
