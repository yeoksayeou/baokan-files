    We Must Launch a Signature Campaign to Fight for World Peace
    Liu Qingyang
    All good people in all peace-loving and free countries around the world have stood up, bravely and resolutely resisting the imperialist war criminals who endanger human security, in order to defend lasting world peace.
    We Chinese people, having suffered from more than a century of imperialist aggression, have gone through a long struggle. Now, fortunately, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been liberated from semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism and have achieved a great victory! But in the future, to create the people's welfare in production and construction, we must work hard in safety and peace! Therefore, we should call on the people of the whole country and unite with all friendly and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union to jointly launch a signature campaign to defend world peace and rise up to oppose the use of atomic weapons by war criminal countries!

    我们要为争取世界和平展开签名运动
    刘清扬
    全世界一切爱好和平自由国家的良善人民，都已挺起胸膛，为保卫世界持久和平，而坚决反抗危害人类安全的帝国主义战犯。
    我们中国人民，曾因遭受百余年帝国主义侵略，而经过长期奋斗。今幸在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，从半封建半殖民地中解放出来，而获得了伟大胜利！但今后要在生产建设中，创造人民的福利，必须要在安全和平中努力！所以我们应该号召全国人民并联合以苏联为首的各友好民主国家，共同展开保卫世界和平的签名运动，而奋起反对战犯国家的使用原子武器！
