To the Editor:

Recently, the militia of the Seventh District of Shangyi County, Chahar, captured Liu Wenjiang, a habitual bandit who frequently stole grain. He had stolen more than 30 *shi* of grain from the masses. When the militia of the Seventh District sent him to the Judicial Office of the County Government, he was released without strict handling. After Liu Wenjiang returned home, he said, "The government has a lenient policy; it's okay to steal a little." Kang Laosi of Daliuhao Village in the Third District stole grain from Sanwanziwa Village. After he was reported to the District Office, the District Chief said, "He is poor, what else can he do but steal! He won't steal when he has enough (meaning enough to eat and wear)." Later, cadres and militia of Sierenwa Village in the Sixth District captured a bandit (who had just robbed two livestock transporting manure outside the village) and released him without processing by the District or County. Before releasing him, they said to him, "Sending you to the District and County would just be leniency. Get the hell out of here!"

Now, the county has fostered a climate of theft because it has failed to strictly handle theft cases. Wang Er of Liuyoufang Village openly said to people, "Now is the era of the poor. Stealing from you is just dividing your things a little for me." Recently, many young people have been forcibly demanding noodles to eat in villages such as Daqinggou. If they are given too little, they will quarrel and scold. I believe such phenomena should not exist. Is it correct for county and district cadres to understand the issue of theft in this way?

Shangyi County Armed Forces Department, Xu Jianguo

Editor's Note: The situation reflected by Comrade Xu Jianguo shows that some county and district cadres have a vague understanding of the issue of theft. For ordinary petty thieves and bandits, it is necessary to strictly conduct ideological education and labor reform, so that they correctly understand the policies of the People's Government, recognize that theft is an illegal act, and recognize that labor production is the only proper way to overcome poverty. Those who are insincere and do not correct their mistakes must be given due punishment. Arbitrary release is wrong. This will affect social order and harm the interests of the broad masses of the people. It should be recognized that during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, the exploitation and plunder by the reactionaries made it impossible for the broad masses of the people to make a living, forming a serious social problem. At that time, ordinary theft was excusable. But today, when the people are in power, if they do not engage in production, do not seek legitimate ways to make a living, and continue to live by theft, then it is inexcusable. The county and district cadres of Shangyi County should seriously examine their own erroneous understanding of this issue. It is hoped that the Chabei Prefectural Commissioner's Office will conduct inspections and correct this error.

### 尚义县部分县区干部对偷盗问题认识错误

　　尚义县部分县区干部对偷盗问题认识错误编辑同志：
    最近察哈尔尚义县七区民兵，捕到经常偷盗粮食的惯匪刘文江。他曾先后偷盗群众的粮食三十多石。七区民兵将他送到县政府司法处时，未经严格处理，便释放了。刘文江回家后说：“政府有宽大政策，偷点没事。”三区大六号村康老四偷了三湾子洼村的粮食，被告到区公所后，区长说：“他穷，不偷怎么办！有了（意指有了吃穿）就不偷了。”后来，六区死人洼村干部及民兵捉到一个土匪（他刚在该村外抢了送粪的两头牲口），不经区、县处理便释放了；临释放前，对他说道：“送到区和县，也是宽大你。去你妈的罢！”
    现在，该县因未能严格处理偷盗事件，已助长了偷风。刘油房村王二公开对人说：“现在是穷人天下，偷你，就是把你的东西匀点给我。”最近竟有很多年青人在大青沟等村强要面吃，给的少了，还要吵骂。这样的现象，我认为不应有的。县区干部这样认识偷盗问题，是正确的吗？
    尚义县武装部  徐建国
    编者按：徐建国同志所反映的情况，说明了某些县区干部对于偷盗问题认识模糊。对于一般小偷和盗匪，必须严格进行思想教育和劳动改造，使他们正确认识人民政府的政策，认识偷盗是犯法行为，认识劳动生产是克服穷困的唯一正当办法。对于口是心非，知过不改者，必须给以应得的惩处。随便释放是不对的。这会影响社会秩序，妨害广大人民的利益。应该认识，在国民党匪帮统治时期，因为反动派的剥削掠夺，使广大人民无以为生，形成严重的社会问题。那时一般的偷盗行为是可以原谅的。而在人民当政的今天，他们如不从事生产，不寻求正当的生活出路，继续以偷盗为生，则是不可原谅的。尚义县县区干部应该好好检讨自己对这一问题的错误认识。并望察北专署加以检查，纠正这个错误。
