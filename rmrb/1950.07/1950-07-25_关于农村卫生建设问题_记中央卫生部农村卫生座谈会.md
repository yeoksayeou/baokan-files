On Rural Health Construction Issues
    --A Record of the Central Ministry of Health's Rural Health Symposium
    Zhang Qin
    From June 28th to 30th, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government convened a rural health symposium. Participants included health workers from the Northeast People's Government Health Department, the Health Departments of Hebei and Shanxi Provinces, the Health Bureaus of Pingyuan and Chahar Provinces, rural health experimental zones in Tong County and Zhuo County, and the Shifangyuan Health Clinic in the suburbs of Beijing, as well as representatives from relevant bureaus and departments of the Central Ministry of Health and the Ministries of Internal Affairs and Agriculture, totaling twenty-six people. The purpose of the symposium was to gather a wide range of opinions and draw on experiences in preparation for presenting a more comprehensive and practical rural health work plan to the National Health Conference for study and discussion. At the meeting, Su Jingguan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, and Dai Jimin, Director of the Planning and Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Health, delivered speeches successively, explaining the importance of rural health work, its key points, working methods, and attitude. Representatives from various units then introduced the rural health situation, health construction, and experimental work in their respective areas. After introducing the experience of rural experimental health work in Zhuo County, informal discussions were held on issues such as rural health organizations, scope of work, funding, unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and vital statistics and disease mortality reporting. The symposium presented a lot of materials and fully exchanged views, mainly on the following issues:
    An Overview of Promoting Rural Health Experimental Work
    Regarding rural health work, apart from the significant achievements in plague prevention in the Northeast region over the past few years, in North China, East China, and other major administrative regions, this year, the central government organized epidemic prevention teams, and administrative regions, provinces, and special districts organized epidemic prevention and medical teams to focus on prevention and treatment work for plague, kala-azar, disaster areas, and temporary outbreaks of infectious diseases, preventing the spread of epidemics. Some epidemic areas have initially established rural health organizations. In the Northeast and North China, rural health experimental work has been carried out this year in a planned manner. For example, in the first half of the year, the Northeast carried out experimental work in six counties, including Nahe, Shuangcheng, Yushu, Chengde, Fengcheng, and Beizhen. Under the direct leadership of the Central Ministry of Health, North China carried out rural health experimental work in Tong County and Zhuo County. Some other provinces also arranged for key county health work. These experimental counties and some health agencies in areas that did not conduct experimental work conducted specialized and focused rural health surveys and research. In each experimental area, universal spring vaccination was carried out this year. For example, the Tong County rural health experimental area completed vaccination tasks for over 88% of the people who should be vaccinated. The people reflected: "This year, there are no new smallpox cases, which is the benefit of vaccination." At the same time, basic-level health organizations such as rural health committees and resident health groups were established, and health cadres were selected. Some counties also held training classes for district and village health cadres to improve their health knowledge and teach them some working methods. Experimental areas and counties and cities with health institutions generally carried out the transformation of old midwives. The reformed old midwives used new methods of delivery, reducing infant mortality rates. For example, in a certain district of Tong County, the infant mortality rate has been reduced to 20% through the use of new delivery methods by reformed old midwives. With extensive publicity and education and practical assistance, the health knowledge of the masses and cadres has been preliminarily improved, and some improvements have been made to hygiene facilities such as housing, wells, and toilets, initially changing the rural health situation. In carrying out various tasks, general attention has been paid to uniting local traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to participate, such as establishing health worker associations, medical associations, health and medicine cooperatives, and implementing a health responsibility area system. Some counties have also opened training classes for local private practitioners, enabling these private practitioners of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to participate in general health work. Rural health experimental work has gained some experience and is preparing to continue to promote it: In North China, it is planned to expand to thirteen experimental counties based on the Tong County rural health experimental area, and the Northeast plans to expand to forty-two counties this year.
    Farmers Urgently Demand to Be Liberated from the Threat of Disease and Death
    In the rural areas after land reform, there is political security, and farmers who have been allocated land are improving their lives and urgently demand to be liberated from the threat of disease and death. The government calls on and organizes farmers to develop production, while farmers further demand "prosperity for both people and wealth." This demand is manifested in two aspects: One is dissatisfaction and passivity towards the threat of disease and death. When a farmer's only son died due to a smallpox epidemic, he said sadly: "What mood do I have to increase production?" Therefore, he was unwilling to work hard, indulging in eating and drinking, and even felt that living was meaningless. Many farmers' families, because their wives did not conceive or several children died after birth, not only treated their wives with undue abuse and contempt but also became discouraged about production and wealth. When some farmers thought they needed more labor to participate in production, but their homes had young men and women suffering from endemic diseases such as Kashin-Beck disease, osteomalacia, and goiter, becoming semi-disabled, unable to help with production, and gradually increasing the burden, they lost their energy. When some serious infectious diseases were prevalent in rural areas, farmers believed that the inevitable plague had arrived. After seeking help from shamans and witches without success, they became pessimistic and disappointed. All work on production and wealth stopped, and they took out all the things they had accumulated through hard work, eating and using them up, and even destroying them. The above situation is more serious in rural areas without health work, and it has been greatly reduced in rural areas where our health work has penetrated.
    The other is actively requesting assistance from health workers. When our epidemic prevention and medical teams and health experimental work teams went deep into the countryside and contacted them, although they had some doubts at the beginning, they were so grateful and happy when they saved their dying children, cured their diseases, and explained the benefits of health to them! They loved the health workers, warmly retained them, and hoped that the health workers would stay for a long time. When they watched health dramas and realized that believing in gods and Buddhas was useless, they smashed the idols they had worshiped for generations and tore off the Kitchen God. Farmers, both men and women, are most concerned about maternal and child health. In some places, when maternal and child health classes are given to women, many men participate in the lectures. In a certain district of Zhuo County, many men wanted to attend the old midwife training class. Afraid that the old midwives would not let them listen, they hid outside the window every day to eavesdrop. Sometimes, if someone did not hear a lecture one day, they would ask the teachers to give them a supplementary lecture. There are many such examples of active learning. This shows that the farmers' demand to change the unsanitary situation and be liberated from the threat of disease and death is urgent.
    How to guide the former type of farmers to move towards the latter type of demand is a responsibility that health workers in the new China cannot ignore.
    Rural Areas are the Focus of Health Construction
    The demand for health and medical assistance in rural areas is so urgent precisely because the situation of disease and death is extremely serious in rural areas. According to surveys and statistics from various places, the infant mortality rate in rural areas is generally 40% to 50%. Various epidemics are constantly occurring, and a large number of people suffer from various diseases every year. For example, nearly 700 people died in Yanggao this year due to the measles epidemic, combined with pneumonia, etc. According to statistics, 6 million people die from various infectious diseases every year across the country, and over 100 million people suffer from various diseases, of which 80% do not receive medical assistance. And over 80% of China's population is in rural areas, and the most lacking in health and medical assistance is also the rural areas. This determines that rural areas are the most problematic and serious target of health work. At present, agriculture still accounts for 80% to 90% of the economy in New Democratic China, and in order to promote industrial production, it is necessary to improve agricultural production. In areas that have already undergone land reform, the government requires rapid improvement of agricultural production, and farmers are also happy to get rich, but they are threatened by serious diseases and deaths, increasing their economic losses and burdens, weakening their labor force, and severely impacting their production enthusiasm. To solve these problems, improve the health level of farmers, and cooperate with the increase in rural production, this is the urgent demand of farmers, the intention of national economic construction, and also what Deputy Minister Su of the Central Ministry of Health mentioned at the meeting—that the focus of health construction in the future is in rural areas, and cities are a matter of reforming existing health institutions. Judging from the severity of rural health problems, from the intention of national economic construction, and from the interests of farmers, rural areas should be the focus of health work in the future.
    Rural Health Organizations and Key Work Points
    The Central People's Government, valuing rural health work, has recently approved the establishment of small-scale epidemic prevention teams in counties and the establishment of health institutions at all levels below the county. The funds will be resolved by the provinces and counties. As for how to cultivate rural health cadres, the form of health organizations, what work to do, and the working methods, etc., Deputy Minister Su Jingguan pointed out in his speech: "This is a major task, and health agencies at all levels must seriously study these issues." In the informal discussions, it was generally believed that counties should establish health sections to lead the health院 and the health administrative work of the county. Districts should set up health centers, temporarily staffed by health assistants; villages should set up health workers; and residents' health groups should set up health group leaders. Mass health committees at all levels, organized by people from all walks of life from the county to the village, should cooperate with health agencies to promote health work. To strive for more health power, it is necessary to organize and educate local traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel, such as establishing health worker associations, professional associations, and organizing them to conduct political studies and run short-term training courses, and to take care of the current economic conditions and the lives of private practitioners, organizing joint clinics and hospitals with public and private assistance. In short, it is necessary to form a broad unified health front under the guidance of health agencies. Regarding the key issues of rural health work, Deputy Minister Su also said that in addition to general health guidance and medical assistance, the key points of work should be: First, infectious disease management. Such as timely detection of epidemics, rational prevention and treatment, so that they do not spread into disasters; Second, maternal and child health. The emphasis is on reducing infant mortality rates and protecting the health of mothers. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job in the transformation of old midwives, train a group of new midwifery personnel, thoroughly change the old midwifery methods in rural areas, and break the farmers' superstitious ideas and unreasonable disposal methods for mothers; Third, nutritional guidance. Farmers have the conditions to improve their lives in the future, and the problem is "unscientific." It is necessary to help them improve their lives and increase nutrition under the existing conditions. Doing the above three points well will greatly change the serious epidemic and death situation in rural areas.
    Work Attitude and Working Methods
    To do a good job in rural health work, first of all, health personnel must clearly recognize the importance of rural health, eliminate the neglectful attitude and biased understanding of rural health work. Such as thinking that the focus of health work is in cities, that the conditions for health work in cities are good, that rural health work is low-level and simple, or that they are afraid of hardship and unwilling to go to rural areas. Some have also done some rural health work in the past, and although today's objective conditions and requirements are different, they still limit themselves to the old narrow circle. These views will hinder the development of rural health work and must be completely changed. With the new environment, a new attitude should be established, and one should go to the rural areas where the situation of disease and death is most serious, approach farmers, integrate with them in life, conduct in-depth investigations and research, discover problems, and relieve the pain of farmers. Due to the vast area of rural areas, the population is not as concentrated as in cities, transportation is inconvenient, and farmers have a loose nature, low cultural level, and deeper superstitious ideas due to their working environment and living conditions. These are all difficulties that must be encountered in carrying out health work in rural areas. Therefore, it is required that every health worker not only attach importance to rural health work but also not be afraid of difficulties. To work in rural areas, one must determine a point of view that one can endure hardship. In terms of working methods, the most important thing is publicity and education and the mass line in work. One must use the greatest patience and tirelessly conduct various forms of publicity to farmers, and use practical examples to convince them. One must be good at mobilizing and organizing the masses, relying on the masses, and always considering how to combine it with rural production work, rather than making them feel that health personnel are increasing their troubles.
    How to gradually establish rural health work with the victory of the national land reform is the most arduous task that all health workers must complete with a hundredfold effort.

　　关于农村卫生建设问题
    ——记中央卫生部农村卫生座谈会
    张芹
    六月二十八日至三十日三天内，中央人民政府卫生部召开了农村卫生座谈会。参加会的有东北人民政府卫生部，河北、山西省卫生厅，平原、察哈尔省卫生局，通县、涿县乡村卫生实验区，北京郊区什方院保健院等单位卫生工作者，中央卫生部有关各局处和内务部、农业部代表共二十六人。座谈会目的是广泛收集意见，吸取经验，准备给全国卫生会议提出一个较全面切合实际的农村卫生工作方案，以供大会研究讨论。会上中央人民政府卫生部苏井观副部长，卫生部计划检查局戴济民局长等先后发表了意见，说明农村卫生工作的重要性、工作要点、工作方法、工作态度等。各单位相继介绍了各地乡村卫生情况、卫生建设、实验工作等。在介绍了涿县乡村实验卫生工作经验以后，随即就农村卫生组织、工作范围、经费、团结中西医、生命统计与疾病死亡报告等问题进行了漫谈。座谈会介绍了很多材料，充分交换了意见，主要的有以下几个问题：
    推行农村卫生实验工作概况
    农村的卫生工作，除东北区数年来在鼠疫预防工作上已有显著成绩外，在华北、华东等各大行政区，今年对鼠疫、黑热病，灾区及各地临时发生的传染病，中央组织了防疫总队及各行政区、省、专署等都曾组织防疫医疗队，重点的进行防治工作，阻止了疫病蔓延。有的疫区已初步建立起农村卫生组织。在东北、华北今年有计划地进行了农村卫生实验工作，如东北上半年开展了纳河、双城、榆树、承德、凤城、北镇等六个县的实验工作；在中央卫生部的直接领导下华北进行了通县、涿县乡村卫生实验工作；其他有些省也曾布置了重点县的卫生工作。这些实验县和一部分未进行实验工作的各区卫生机关，都曾专门的有重点的进行过农村卫生调查和研究。在各个实验区内，今年都进行了春季普遍种痘工作，如通县乡村卫生实验区完成了应种人数百分之八十八强的种痘任务，老百姓反映：“今年没有新麻子增加，这是种痘的好处。”同时，建立了乡村卫生委员会、居民卫生小组等基层卫生组织，选拔卫生干部。有的县并举办了区、村卫生干部训练班，提高了他们的卫生知识，教会了一些工作办法。各实验区及其他有卫生机构的县市，一般的都进行了旧产婆改造工作，改造后的旧产婆用新法接生，减低了婴儿的死亡率。如通县某区，改造后的旧产婆用新法接生，已使婴儿死亡率降到百分之二十。在广泛的宣传教育和实际的帮助下，群众和干部的卫生知识初步提高了，对于住屋、水井、厕所等卫生设施，已有一些改进，初步改变了农村卫生情况。在进行各种工作中，一般都注意团结地方中西医参加，如成立卫生工作者协会、医联会、卫生医药合作社、实行卫生责任区制。有的县并开办地方开业医训练班，使这些开业中西医都参加了一般的卫生工作。乡村卫生实验工作已取得了一些经验，准备继续推广：在华北，准备以通县乡村卫生实验区为基础，扩大到十三个实验县，东北今年准备扩大到四十二个县。
    农民迫切要求从疾病死亡威胁中解放出来
    在土地改革后的农村，政治上有了保障，已分得了土地的农民，生活在上升，并迫切要求把他们从疾病死亡威胁中解放出来。政府号召与组织农民发展生产，而农民则进一步的要求“人财两旺”。他们这种要求表现在两方面：一种是对疾病死亡的威胁表现出不满和消极。当某农民家因天花流行死了他的独生子，伤心的说：“还有什么心情增加生产呢？”于是不愿再刻苦了，大吃大喝，甚至觉得活着都没意思。不少农民家因为媳妇不生育或生下几胎都死了，不仅对他的媳妇以不应有的虐待和轻视，对生产发家也泄气。当某些农民想到需要更多的劳动力来参加生产，而家中正有着患了大骨节病、骨软化病、甲状腺肿等地方病的青年男女，成为半残废，不能帮助生产，逐渐增加了负担，他们就泄了劲。当着某些严重的传染病在农村流行时，农民们认为这是不可避免的瘟疫到来，他们经过求助于神巫而无效以后，于是悲观失望了，一切生产发家的工作都停止了，将千辛万苦积蓄下来的东西，都拿出吃光、用完，甚至于毁掉。以上情况在没有卫生工作的农村较严重，我们卫生工作深入的农村，已大大减少了。
    另一种是积极的要求卫生工作者对他们的帮助，当我们的防疫医疗队、卫生实验工作队，深入到农村，和他们接触后，虽然他们开始时还有过一些怀疑，但当救活了他们垂危的小孩，治愈了他们的疾病，给他们讲通了卫生的好处以后，他们是如何的感激和高兴！他们爱戴卫生人员，热情的挽留，希望卫生人员长期住着不走。当他们看了卫生戏，觉悟到相信神佛没有用时，他们将供奉着几辈子的偶像都打毁了，撕走了灶王爷。农民们无论男女，他们最关心的是妇婴卫生，有些地方给妇女们讲妇婴卫生课时，很多男子参加听课。涿县某区旧产婆训练班，每到上课时都有很多男子要听，他们怕旧产婆不让听，都每天躲在窗外偷听，有时谁一天没有听到，还要教员给他们补讲。像这样积极求知的例子很多。这说明了农民对改变不卫生情况，从疾病死亡的威胁中获得解放的要求是迫切的。
    如何把前一种农民也引导走向后一种要求，这是新中国卫生工作者不容忽视的责任。
    农村是卫生建设的重点
    农村对卫生医药帮助的要求这样急切，正是因为疾病死亡情况在农村中极其严重。据各地的调查统计，农村的婴儿死亡率，一般的是百分之四十到五十。各种疫病不断在流行发生，每年有大批的人，患着各种疫病。如今年阳高的麻疹流行，合并肺炎等而死亡的将近七百人。据统计，全国每年有六百万人因各种传染病而死亡，有一亿多人患着各种疾病，其中百分之八十得不到医药的帮助。而中国人口百分之八十以上在农村，最缺乏卫生医药帮助的也是农村。这就确定了农村是问题最多最严重的卫生工作对象。目前，新民主主义中国经济百分之八、九十还是农业，为促进工业生产又必须提高农业生产。在已经土改的地区，政府要求迅速提高农业生产，农民也乐于发家致富，但由于严重的疾病死亡在威胁着他们，增加了他们经济上的损失和负担，减弱了他们的劳动力，严重打击着他们的生产情绪。要解决这些问题，提高农民的健康水平，配合农村的增加生产，这是农民迫切的要求，是国家经济建设的意图，也正是中央卫生部苏副部长在会上谈到的——今后卫生建设的重点在农村，城市是对旧有卫生机构加以改造的问题。从农村卫生问题的严重情况来看，从国家经济建设的意图来看，从农民的利益来看，今后农村应该是卫生工作的重点。
    农村卫生组织与工作要点
    中央人民政府因重视农村卫生工作，最近已批准在县设小型的防疫队，并设立县以下各级卫生机构，经费由各省、县解决，至于如何培养农村卫生干部，卫生组织的形式，要进行什么工作以及工作方式方法等，苏井观副部长在发言中指出：“这是重大的任务，要各级卫生机关认真的来研究这些问题。”漫谈中一般认为县应设卫生科，领导卫生院及全县卫生行政工作。区设卫生所，由卫生助理暂时兼任；村设卫生员；居民卫生小组设卫生小组长。由县到村组织各界参加的群众性的各级卫生委员会，以配合卫生机关，推动卫生工作。为争取更多的卫生力量，须组织与教育地方中西医务人员，如成立卫生工作者协会，各专业公会和组织他们进行政治学习，办短期的训练班等，并照顾目前的经济条件与开业医的生活，组织民办公助的联合诊疗所、医院等。总之，要结成由卫生机关指导的广大卫生统一战线。关于农村卫生工作重点问题，苏副部长也谈到：除了一般的卫生指导和医药帮助以外，工作要点应该是：第一、传染病管理。如及时发现疫病，合理防治，不使流行成灾；第二、妇婴卫生。着重在减少婴儿的死亡率，保护产妇的健康，因此必须做好旧产婆的改造工作，训练一批新的助产人员，彻底改变农村旧的接产方法，破除农民对产妇的迷信思想和不合理的处置办法；第三，营养指导。今后农民生活提高已有了条件，成问题的是“不科学”，要帮助他们在现有的条件下改善生活，增加营养。做好了以上三点，会大大的改变农村中严重的疫病死亡情况。
    工作态度与工作方法
    要作好农村卫生工作，首先要卫生人员明确认识到农村卫生的重要性，扫除对农村卫生工作的忽视态度与偏差认识。如认为卫生工作重点在城市，城市卫生工作条件好，农村卫生工作低级、简单，或者因为怕吃苦，不愿到农村去。还有的是过去做了一些农村卫生工作，虽然今天客观条件和要求不同了，但他们仍把自己限制在旧的狭隘圈子内。这些看法都会妨碍农村卫生工作的开展，要彻底转变。随着新的环境应确立新的态度，要到疾病死亡情况最严重的农村中去，接近农民，与他们在生活中打成一片，深入调查研究，发现问题，解除农民的痛苦。由于农村面积广，人口不像城市那样集中，交通不方便，农民因工作环境和生活条件所养成的散漫性，文化水准低，迷信思想较深，这都是在农村进行卫生工作中必然要遇到的困难。因此就要求每个卫生工作者不但要重视农村卫生工作，更不怕困难，到农村去工作就要确定能吃苦的观点。在工作方法上，最重要的是宣传教育和工作上的群众路线，要用最大的耐心，不倦的向农民进行各种方式的宣传，用实际例子去说服他们。善于发动组织群众，依靠群众，要时时刻刻考虑到如何结合农村的生产工作，而不是使他们感觉卫生人员在增加他们的麻烦。
    如何随着全国土改的胜利进行，逐步的建立起农村卫生工作，这是要全体卫生工作者以百倍努力去完成的最艰巨任务。
