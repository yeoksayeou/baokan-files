　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th: South Korean people's guerrillas, regardless of the bloody suppression by American aggressors and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, are bravely cooperating with the People's Army to attack American aggressors. According to a report by United Press reporter James: a spokesman for the South Korean puppet government declared: "Since the beginning of the war, it is not known how many guerrillas have been shot. The government does not have so many prisons to hold them." However, in the rear and front lines of the American and Li Chengwan puppet armies, there are still "snipers everywhere." An American soldier, Waldenburg, said: "They really give us a headache on the battlefield. You see a guy dressed as a farmer, holding a rake, and as soon as you turn around, he shoots you." Another American soldier, Brogan, said: Several times they met civilians, "but they opened fire on us." On the 8th, an American artillery position was sniped by guerrillas. American personnel who went deep into the front lines with the bridge surveying team said: "There are snipers everywhere there."

　　南朝鲜人民游击队到处狙击美国侵略者
    【新华社十日讯】南朝鲜人民游击队不顾美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮血腥的镇压，英勇地配合人民军袭击美国侵略者。据合众社记者詹姆士报道：南朝鲜傀儡政府的发言人宣称：“战争开始以后，已经不知道枪毙了多少游击队。政府没有那么多的监狱去关他们。”但是，在美军和李承晚傀儡军的后方和前线仍然“到处都是狙击手”。美军士兵瓦登堡说：“他们真使我们在战场上伤脑筋。你看见一个家伙，农民打扮，手里拿着耙，待你转过身去，他就开枪打你。”另一个美军士兵勃罗根说：有好些回遇见了老百姓，“可是他们却向我们开了火”。八日，一处美国炮兵阵地曾经遭到游击队的狙击。随桥梁测量队深入前线的美军人员说：“那里到处都是狙击手”。
