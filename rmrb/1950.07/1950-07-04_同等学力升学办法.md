　　Regulations for Enrollment Based on Equivalent Academic Ability
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, in its regulations for the 1950 summer enrollment of new students in institutions of higher education, stipulates: "Those with equivalent academic ability to high school graduates may also apply, but must have certification from education administrative organs of the people's government at or above the county level or municipal people's government." This is to break the past tendency of overemphasizing graduation certificates for application qualifications, so that self-taught young intellectuals will not be excluded from institutions of higher education. At the same time, appropriate restrictions will be placed on skipping grades or opportunistic behavior by those who do not meet the high school graduation level.
    In order to specifically implement the above regulations, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, based on the instructions of the Central Ministry of Education and combined with the actual situation in this city, has stipulated the following four certification methods:
    (1) Self-taught young intellectuals may obtain certification from their work unit or local government regarding their self-study situation, and submit preliminary opinions on whether they possess the equivalent of a high school graduation level. The Bureau of Culture and Education will review their age, occupation, resume, and actual self-study situation before issuing or denying certification.
    (2) Students in the third year of senior high school (i.e., those who will graduate this winter vacation) who hold certificates of completion and transcripts, and whose academic performance is indeed excellent, may be certified.
    (3) Those who dropped out of school for some reason, have undergone a considerable period of self-study, and hold a certificate of completion from the original school and a self-study certificate may be certified. (The self-study certificate may be issued by the local government or the teacher responsible for guiding the self-study, but must be stamped with the official seal of the school where the teacher works. The content of the certificate should include the duration of self-study, course content, and self-study grades, etc.)
    (4) Those who originally studied at School A and transferred to School B for auditing due to some reason, and hold a certificate of completion from School A and a certificate of auditing from School B, proving that they have indeed completed the three-year high school course, may be certified.

　　同等学力升学办法
    【京市新闻处讯】中央人民政府教育部在高等学校一九五○年度暑期招考新生的办法中规定：“凡具有高中毕业的同等学力者亦可投考，但须有县以上人民政府或市人民政府教育行政机关之证明”，以打破过去投考资格过分重视毕业证书的偏向，使自学青年知识分子不致被摈于高等学校门外；同时，对不够高中毕业程度者之跳级、取巧行为，予以适当限制。
    为具体执行上项的规定，京市文教局特根据中央教育部的指示，并结合本市实际情况，规定证明办法四项：
    （一）自学之青年知识分子，可由其工作机关或当地区政府出具关于其从事自学情况之证明，并提出对于其是否具有高中毕业程度之初步意见，经文教局研究其年龄、职业、履历及从事自学之实际情况后，予以证明或拒绝。
    （二）持有肄业证件及成绩单，经审核其程度确实优等之春季始业高中三年级学生（即须至今年寒假才能高中毕业者），可予证明。
    （三）因故辍学，经过相当的自修期间，持有原校肄业证件及自修证明书者可予证明。（自修证明书可由当地区政府或负责指导自修之教师出具，但须加盖该教师服务学校之公章。证明书内容包括自修期限、课程内容及自修成绩等。）
    （四）原在甲校学习，因故转入乙校旁听，持有甲校肄业证件及乙校旁听证件，证明确已修毕高中三年课程者，可予证明。
