　　Seventy-three Counties in Hebei Province
    Vigorously Suppress Locust Nymphs
    Complacency and Neglect in Some Areas Urgently Need Correction
    [This newspaper reported] According to reports from various correspondents: Since mid-May, locust nymphs have been discovered in most areas of Hebei Province. In order to protect seedlings and prevent disasters, local people's governments and CCP committees are vigorously organizing and leading the masses to actively suppress locust nymphs. Since mid-March, some counties in the province have been experiencing locust nymph outbreaks. At that time, because the area was small, the locusts were quickly suppressed as soon as they appeared, preventing a disaster. However, after mid-May, locust nymphs successively appeared in various places again. As of now, the affected areas involve ten special districts and seventy-three counties. The affected areas are mostly in areas where locusts occurred last year, or in uncultivated white land in the fall, as well as hillsides, wasteland, graveyards, roadsides, and water-deprived land. According to incomplete statistics from thirty counties in the Handan and Hengshui special districts alone, the affected area has reached more than 600,000 mu, of which Jing County has the most serious, with 120,000 mu. According to statistics from six counties, Fuping, Jing County, Yuanshi, Quyang, Xingtang, and Feixiang, approximately 20,000 mu of seedlings have been eaten.

    After the locust nymph outbreak, the people's governments and CCP committees at all levels in the province fully led the masses, combining wheat harvesting, weeding, and aphid control, and launched an anti-locust campaign under the slogan "Where locust nymphs occur, eliminate them there." Anti-locust headquarters at the county, district, and village levels have been established in various places. Many responsible cadres at the special district and county levels have personally gone deep into the locust nymph outbreak areas to provide leadership. According to statistics from Jing County alone on June 1, the county mobilized more than 27,000 people and completely eliminated locust nymphs from 54,000 mu of land. Currently, 21 counties including Handan, Guangping, Julu, and Xiajin have completely eliminated locust nymphs, three counties including En County, Wuqiang, and Qing County have largely eliminated them, and sixteen counties including Daming, Wei County, Xingtai, Hengshui, and Huolu have completely eliminated them but have re-emerged. Thirty-three counties such as Ji County, Wei County, Fucheng, and Xingtang are working hard to capture and kill locust nymphs. Among them, some locust nymphs in Fucheng and Xingtang counties have turned into flying locusts, which urgently need to be quickly suppressed.

    In the process of capture and extermination, some cadres and the masses have shown complacency and neglect, especially in the border areas between certain counties and districts. For example, Jia Rongqing, the district head of the fifth district of Xingtang County, stayed in Bali Village in the district for more than ten days without mobilizing the masses to capture and kill locust nymphs, nor did he report to the higher authorities, resulting in 200 mu of seedlings being eaten up by locust nymphs. In seventeen villages including Manhe in Fucheng County, it was not discovered until the locust nymphs grew to six or seven centimeters long, more than 10% turned into flying locusts, and most of the seedlings were eaten up. In the forty-eighth village of Xian County, where there is one crop of water and one crop of wheat every year, the wheat has been harvested, and the masses are unwilling to kill locust nymphs, resulting in their spread elsewhere. Locusts are serious in Zhao City Village in Wuqiang, but because it is a border area, no one pays attention to it, and half of them have turned into flying locusts and are now developing towards the Raoyang border. The same phenomenon has occurred at the borders between Wuqiang and Xian County, Dacheng and Qing County, and Dacheng and Jinghai. In addition, some people are only busy with harvesting wheat or weeding, allowing locust nymphs to develop. The above phenomenon should arouse serious attention and correction from various places.

　　河北省七十三县
    大力扑灭蝗蝻
    部分地区麻痹忽视亟须纠正
    【本报讯】综合各通讯员报导：五月中旬以来，河北省大部地区发现蝗蝻，为了保护禾苗，不使成灾，各地人民政府、中共党委正大力组织与领导群众积极扑灭蝗蝻。该省自三月中旬以来，有些县份即不断发生蝗蝻，当时因面积较小，一经发生，随即扑灭，未致成灾。但到五月中旬以后，各地又相继发生蝗蝻。截至目前为止，波及的地区已有十个专区、七十三县。发生地区多在去年发生过的地区或去秋未耕过的白地及山坡、草荒、坟地、路边以及水脱地等。仅据邯郸、衡水两专区三十个县的不完全统计，为害面积即达六十余万亩，其中以景县的十二万亩为最重。吃光禾苗的，据阜平、景县、元氏、曲阳、行唐、肥乡等六县统计，约有二万亩左右。
    蝗蝻发生后，该省各级人民政府、中共党委即全力领导群众，结合麦收、锄苗、治蚜等工作，在“蝗蝻发生在那里，就把它消灭在那里”的口号下，展开了灭蝗运动。各地先后成立了县、区、村三级灭蝗指挥部。不少专、县负责干部均亲自深入蝗蝻发生地区进行领导。仅据景县六月一日一天的统计，全县发动群众二万七千多人，把五万四千亩地的蝗蝻全部扑灭。目前蝗蝻已被全部消灭的地区有邯郸、广平、巨鹿、夏津等二十一县，大部消灭的有恩县、武强、青县等三县，全部消灭又重新发生的有大名、魏县、邢台、衡水、获鹿等十六县。他如蓟县、威县、阜城、行唐等三十三县正在努力进行捕打。其中阜城、行唐等县部分蝗蝻已变成飞蝗，急需迅速扑灭。
    在捕打过程中，有一部分干部、群众表现麻痹、忽视，特别在某些县、区交界地区，表现更为严重。如行唐县五区区长贾荣卿在该区八里庄十余日，没有发动群众捕打，也不向上级报告，结果使二百亩小苗被蝗蝻吃光。阜城县漫河等十七个村直到蝗蝻长到六、七分长，百分之十以上变为飞蝗，将小苗大部吃光时才发现。献县四十八村，每年一水一麦，麦子已收，发现蝗蝻群众不愿打，以致蔓延别处。武强赵市村蝗虫严重，因系边境没人注意，已有二分之一变成飞蝗，现正向饶阳边境发展。武强与献县、大城与青县、大城与静海边境处亦有同样现象发生。此外，还有一些群众光顾收麦或锄苗，使蝗蝻发展起来。上述现象应引起各地严重注意与纠正。（卢擎霄、张石锁、陈明善、秦政民、石彦明、赵立顺、赵英才、苑明远、张恒章、王国正、张颖异、孙维韬、韩文焕、薛涛、方枫、加力、赵志生、徐鸿广、于岩、赵德齐、李玉琪、张兰芬、杨杰、高永昌、任健、乔章仁、阎根槐、张新榜）
