The Beijing Postal Administration has expanded its remittance scope and increased remittance limits to facilitate people's remittances. At the same time, it has reduced remittance fees for ordinary postal money orders across the board. Furthermore, starting July 20, it began remittances to Lushun and Dalian. The procedures are simple, and the remittance is quick. People from all walks of life who wish to remit money can go to the nearest post office to handle it.

In addition to handling telegraphic transfer services at the business counters of the main office and the branch offices on West Chang'an Street, Houmen Street, Luomashi Street, Dongsi, Xisi, Bamiancao, and Shida, and the Dongjiaominxiang Savings and Remittance Bureau, the bureau has also added telegraphic transfer services at the Ganshiqiao and Liulichang branch offices since July 16.
