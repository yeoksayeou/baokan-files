　　Beijing Machine Factory Third Branch
    Celebrating "July 1st" Production Competition
    Striving to Complete 3,000 Waterwheel Task Challenging the Main Factory to Guarantee Improved Quality
    [Our Dispatch] The Third Branch of the Beijing Machine Factory launched a production competition on the 25th to welcome "July 1st." The competition goal is to complete one-quarter of the manufacturing work for 3,000 Liberation-style waterwheels in six days.

    In early April, after the factory received the task of producing 3,000 Liberation-style waterwheels in April, May, and June, the workers actively engaged in production. However, due to imperfect machinery and equipment, and the untimely supply of raw materials, work had to be suspended. By June 22nd, only three-quarters of the total task had been completed. In order to welcome "July 1st" and celebrate the Party's birthday, all employees of the factory, under the call of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, launched a competition to rush to complete the manufacturing of all the waterwheels.

    After the competition began on the 25th, three assembly teams challenged the entire machine shop, requesting that they supply parts for 150 waterwheels per day. The machine shop replied: "Not only will we complete the quantity, but we will also guarantee the quality." The challenge and response column on the wall newspaper was filled with red and green battle letters.

    New production heroes and model workers' names appeared on the blackboard newspaper and the honor roll. Novice Bai Yaolin of the chain group surrounded 537 chains on the first day and 918 chains on the second day. The original chain group created a new record of surrounding 1,130 chains in one day. Zhang Jinghang surrounded 150 chains in an eight-hour night shift. The factory's previous highest personal record was 100 chains per day. Guan Huichuan machined 66 sprocket eyes in one day, doubling the output compared to before. Zhang Peizhi machined 20 horizontal shafts in half a day, compared to the previous 16 or 17 per day. Yang Shaowu machined 64 large frame vertical shaft eyes in one day, doubling the output compared to before. Repair workers Li Dexiang and Yang Jinghua continued to work during the noon break. Fitters Liu Daijie, Fan Guanglu, and Chen Guodong, seeing that the copper sleeve group's output was insufficient, voluntarily worked three hours of overtime every day. In addition to assembling 135 waterwheels on the 26th (compared to the usual 70 to 80 per day), the three assembly teams also installed 1,500 leather pad holders and trimmed burrs from seven large frames (equivalent to six or seven workers' worth). Many workers brought their own valuable tools to the factory to improve work efficiency. Staff and odd-job workers also actively participated in labor in addition to striving in their respective positions. The factory's administration has prepared two red flags to reward the heroes in this production competition.

    Also: On the 27th, the factory issued a challenge to the main factory's foundry, stating: In order to welcome our Party's birthday, we hope you: produce as much as possible, without delaying our use; and guarantee the quality is better than that of ordinary private merchants. The main factory's foundry immediately responded to their challenge, saying: We fully accept your request, guaranteeing to complete 350 sprocket wheels and 70 waterwheel bodies before July 1st, and will definitely guarantee good quality, exceeding your requirements.

　　北京机器厂三分厂
    庆祝“七一”竞赛生产
    争取完成三千部水车任务  向总厂挑战保证提高质量
    【本报讯】北京机器总厂第三分厂，自二十五日起展开了迎接“七一”的生产竞赛。竞赛目标系争取以六天时间突击完成三千部解放式水车四分之一的制造工作。
    四月初，该厂接到四、五、六三个月生产三千部解放式水车任务后，工友们都积极进行生产，但因机器设备不完善，原料材料又不能及时供应，因之只好停工待料。直到六月二十二日止，才完成全部任务的四分之三。该厂为了迎接“七一”，庆祝党的生日，全体职工在党、政、工、团的号召下，展开了突击完成全部水车制造的竞赛。
    二十五日展开竞赛后，三个装成组向机工部全体挑战，要求他们每天能供给装成一百五十部水车用的零件。机工部的回答是：“不但数量上完成而且保证质量上合格。”墙报的挑战应战栏内贴满了红红绿绿的战斗书。
    新的生产英雄和生产模范的名字涌现在黑板报和光荣榜上。生手白瑶林链子组第一天围链子五百三十七条，第二天围了九百十八条。原来的链子组创造了一天围一千一百三十条的新纪录。张景杭一人八小时夜班围出一百五十条链子。该厂过去个人最高纪录一天围一百条。关汇川一天车出六十六个链轮眼，产量较前提高一倍、张培智半天车出二十个横轴，往日一天才出十六、七个。杨少武一天车出六十四个大架子立轴眼，产量较前增加两倍。修理工李德祥、杨景华在中午休息时间继续工作。钳工刘代杰、范广禄、陈国栋三人看见铜套组出活不够，自动每天加班三小时。三个装成组在二十六日一天内除装成一百三十五部水车外（平日每天生产七十至八十部），又上了一千五百个皮钱托、剔引了七个大架子毛刺（等于六、七个工）。许多工友们都将自己的宝贵工具拿到厂中工作，以提高工作效率。职员及零工杂役人员除努力本位工作外，也热烈参加劳动。该厂行政方面已备就红旗两面，准备奖给此次生产竞赛中的英雄。
    又：该厂于二十七日向总厂铸工发出挑战书称：为了迎接我们党的生日，我们希望你们：出活越多越好，不要耽误我们的使用；并在质量上保证比一般私商的强，总厂铸工立即回答他们的挑战说：我们完全接受你们的要求，保证在七一前，完成三百五十个练轮，七十个水车大身，并一定保证质量好，和超过你们的要求。（魏玉珍、郝瑞祥、高延昌）
