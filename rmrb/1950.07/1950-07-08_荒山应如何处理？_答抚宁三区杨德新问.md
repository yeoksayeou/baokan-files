　　How Should Barren Hills Be Handled?
    --In Response to Yang Dexin from the Third District of Funing

    To the Editor:
    I am Yang Dexin from Yangzhuangtou Village, Third District, Funing County. I am of poor peasant origin. Before the land reform, I had three and a half mu of land and a barren hill (yielding about 300 bundles of pine branches each year) located near Jiuxian Village, five li west of my village. During the land reform in 1947, I was allocated ten mu of land, but Jiuxian Village confiscated my hill (because it was within their village boundary). At the same time, Jiuxian Village's twenty-odd mu of land within our village boundary was also confiscated by our village. Later, the cadres of the two villages consulted and returned the confiscated land to each other. However, after our village took back my barren hill, it was handed over to the village farmers' association for safekeeping and was not returned to me. I discussed this with the village. The cadres said, "The hill was exchanged for land, so it cannot be given to you; if you want the hill, you must give up five or six mu of land in exchange." I am a poor peasant, and it was hard enough to be allocated some land; if I want the hill, I will have less land. Later, I heard the village cadres say, "Let's simply not return your hill, and we plan to cut down all the trees on the hill to cover the village's expenses. The remaining barren hill will be distributed to returning households, landless, or land-poor people in the future." Comrade Editor, is this approach reasonable? Please answer this.

    Editor's Note: The Land Law Outline promulgated in 1947 and the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China promulgated on June 30th of this year both have clear provisions regarding the handling of mountains, forests, and barren land. If Yang Dexin's family has already been allocated enough farmland, then the barren hill may not be distributed.

### 荒山应如何处理？——答抚宁三区杨德新问

　　荒山应如何处理？
    ——答抚宁三区杨德新问编辑同志：
    我是抚宁县第三区杨庄头村人。我是贫农成份。土地改革前我有土地三亩五分，荒山一处（每年约可伐松枝三百捆左右），座落在距我村以西五里的旧县村附近。一九四七年土地改革时，我分到了十亩地，可是旧县村把我的山（因为在他村管界内）没收了。同时旧县村在我村管界内的土地二十余亩亦被我村没收了。以后两村干部磋商，互相把没收的地交还。但是我村把我的荒山要回之后，交村农会保管，不发还给我。我跟村中讨论。干部说：“山是拿地换的，不能给你；若要山，你得拿出五六亩地来换。”我是贫农，好容易分了点地；要山吧，地又少了。以后听村干说：“你的山干脆就不发还了，准备把山上的树全砍伐下来，作村里的开支费用。剩下的秃山待以后分给回村户、无地或少地的人。”编者同志，这样的办法合理吗？请你解答一下。

    编者按：关于山林及荒地的处理办法，一九四七年颁布的土地法大纲及本年六月三十日公布的中华人民共和国土地改革法均有明确规定。如杨德新家中已分得足够的耕地，则荒山可以不分。
