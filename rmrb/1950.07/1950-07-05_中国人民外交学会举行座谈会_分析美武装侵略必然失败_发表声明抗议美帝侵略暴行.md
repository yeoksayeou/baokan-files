Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs held a symposium on July 2 to discuss "The New Situation of U.S. Imperialist Armed Aggression in the East." Members present included Qian Duansheng, Hu Yuzhi, Luo Longji, Zhang Youyu, Wu Han, Lian Guan, Tao Menghe, Zeng Zhaolun, Huang Qixiang, Sa Kongliao, Huan Qing, Qu Tangliang, Zhang Mingyang, Mei Ru'ao, Ji Chaoding, Wang Renshu, Weng Dujian, Wang Tieya, and others, as well as members of the Foreign Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including Chen Shutong, Qian Changzhao, and Xie Bangding, totaling more than ninety people. The meeting began with a speech by the institute's president, Zhang Xiruo, followed by a report on recent general developments by Chen Jiakang. Liu Ningyi, a director of the institute who had just returned from Europe, reported on many observations abroad. He analyzed in detail the economic crisis in the United States, thereby determining that the current atrocities of the United States were bound to fail. Zhou Gengsheng, vice president of the institute, explained from a legal standpoint that U.S. imperialism was destroying the United Nations and was completely illegal both procedurally and practically. Subsequently, Meng Xianzhang, Li Rumian, Fan Hong, Lei Jieqiong, Liu Wang Liming, Shao Lizi, Zeng Zhaolun, and Chen Shutong spoke successively, unanimously and sternly refuting Truman's illegal statement and the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism. Finally, Qiao Guanhua, vice president of the institute, made a summary, and all unanimously passed a statement opposing U.S. imperialist armed aggression in the East.

[Report from this newspaper] The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs issued a statement opposing U.S. imperialist armed aggression in the East.

The statement pointed out: This new act of aggression by U.S. imperialism is completely unreasonable. Who doesn't know that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory? Who doesn't know that U.S. imperialism's attack on the Korean people is an unbridled criminal act? Who doesn't know that Bảo Đại and Elpidio Quirino are 100% puppets of imperialism, and that U.S. military "aid" to them is an open interference in the internal affairs of Vietnam and the Philippines, attempting to prevent the liberation struggles of the Vietnamese and Filipino people?

This new act of aggression by U.S. imperialism has no legal basis whatsoever. The U.S. government attempts to cover up its crimes of aggression with resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, but everyone knows that without the participation of the representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet representative, the Security Council's resolutions are completely illegal.

The statement said: This new act of aggression by U.S. imperialism cannot intimidate anyone. The U.S. government's adoption of this new adventurous action precisely shows that its past conspiracy to dominate Asia through its puppets has failed. It can only come out into the open itself and carry out direct military aggression. But "when a rat crosses the street, everyone shouts 'kill it!'" Since this "rat" of U.S. imperialism has shown its true colors on the streets of Asia, flaunting itself in the market, the result will inevitably be to arouse the "shouts of 'kill it!'" from all the people of Asia. When imperialism has to show its true colors, that is when imperialism is approaching its grave.

The statement strongly protests the aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism and calls on all patriotic people of China to unite as one, with one heart and one mind, to fight to the end to liberate their motherland from the hands of the American aggressors!

　　中国人民外交学会举行座谈会
    分析美武装侵略必然失败
    发表声明抗议美帝侵略暴行
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民外交学会于七月二日举行座谈会，讨论“美帝在东方武装侵略的新形势”。出席会员钱端升、胡愈之、罗隆基、张友渔、吴晗、连贯、陶孟和、曾昭抡、黄琪翔、萨空了、宦卿、区棠亮、张明养、梅汝璈、冀朝鼎、王任叔、翁独健、王铁崖等，及人民政协全国委员会外交组委员陈叔通、钱昌照、谢邦定等共九十余人。首由该会会长张奚若致词后，陈家康报告最近一般形势发展的情况。甫自欧洲返国的该会理事刘宁一报告了许多国外见闻。他详细分析了美国的经济危机，从而断定美国目前的暴行必然失败。该会副会长周鲠生从法理上说明美帝国主义破坏联合国，在程序上与实际上都是完全违法的。接着孟宪章、李儒勉、樊弘、雷洁琼、刘王立明、邵力子、曾昭抡、陈叔通相继发言，一致严厉驳斥杜鲁门的非法声明和美帝的武装侵略暴行。最后由该会副会长乔冠华作了总结，并全体一致通过了反对美帝在东方的武装侵略的声明。
    【本报讯】中国人民外交学会为反对美帝在东方的武装侵略发表声明。
    声明指出：美帝国主义这一新的侵略行动是毫无道理的。谁不知道台湾是我中国领土不可分的一部分？谁不知道美帝国主义进攻朝鲜人民是一种无法无天的犯罪行为？谁不知道保大和季里诺是帝国主义的百分之百的傀儡，而美国对于他们的军事“援助”是公开干涉越南和菲律宾的内政，妄图阻止越南和菲律宾人民的解放斗争？
    美帝国主义这一新的侵略行动是毫无法律根据的。美国政府企图用联合国安理会决议来掩盖它的侵略罪行，但谁都知道，没有中华人民共和国的代表和苏联代表的参加，安理会的决议是完全非法的。
    声明称：美帝国主义这一新的侵略行动是吓不倒人的。美国政府采取了这一新的冒险行动，正是说明它过去那一套通过其傀儡以霸占亚洲的阴谋失败了。只有自己公开出场，进行直接军事侵略。但“老鼠过街，万人叫打”。美帝国主义这只“老鼠”既然显出原形在亚洲的大街上，招摇过市，其结果必然是引起全亚洲人民的“万人叫打”。帝国主义不得不显出原形的时候，就是帝国主义走近坟墓的时候。
    声明严重抗议美帝国主义的侵略暴行，并号召全中国一切爱国的人民团结起来，万众一心，为从美国侵略者手中解放自己的祖国，奋斗到底！
