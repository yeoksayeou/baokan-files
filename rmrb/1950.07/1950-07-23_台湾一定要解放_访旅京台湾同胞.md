　　Taiwan Must Be Liberated
    ——Interviews with Taiwanese Compatriots in Beijing
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    The American imperialists' brazen public announcement of their intention to invade Taiwan through direct military action has particularly aroused the anger of the Taiwanese people. Taiwanese compatriots in Beijing, during interviews with this reporter, expressed these sentiments of anger.
    Mr. Yang Zhi of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, participated in the peasant movement in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation period. He was arrested in 1931 and imprisoned for seven years. He holds a fully optimistic belief in the liberation of Taiwan. He forcefully stated: "What is American imperialism? Japanese imperialism is its example!"
    Taiwanese youth who wholeheartedly yearn for and love their dear motherland are running back to the mainland of the motherland, defying everything and advancing bravely. In recent days, I interviewed two young men and women who were originally students at Taipei Municipal Datong High School and Taiwan Provincial First Girls' High School, two of the thousands of young students. They enthusiastically said: "Our students will definitely cooperate and maintain order after the People's Liberation Army lands, just like during the February 28th Incident."
    Another member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Zhou Hua, was originally a housewife. She is currently contacting other Taiwanese women in Beijing to work, study, and train themselves, preparing to return to Taiwan in the future to do women's movement work. "America is a paper tiger," Zhou Hua said contemptuously. "Looking at Korea is enough. Our strength is great. Three years ago, America helped Chiang Kai-shek attack the people in this way and that way, and the result was that we were defeated by the people. Now, the strength of our People's Liberation Army is even stronger, and the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world are even greater. This small group of bandits in Taiwan cannot escape their fate of destruction."
    Zhang Yongli, a businessman who participated in the February 28th struggle, only left Taiwan this February. He described the disastrous life of the Taiwanese people under the multiple exploitations and oppressions of the remaining bandits and American imperialists in the past year. First of all, the more than six million people of Taiwan have to support more than one million military, government, and educational personnel of the remaining bandits. If you calculate it, on average, every six people have to support one person, how can this burden be borne! Secondly, the remaining bandits of the Kuomintang inherited 72 percent of Taiwan's land from the Japanese imperialists, becoming the big landlords of Taiwan, exploiting the more than three million farmers of Taiwan through merchants and small and medium landlords. At the same time, American imperialism monopolizes Taiwan's economic lifeline, controlling important enterprises such as sugar, camphor, fertilizer, medicine, rice, and kimberlite mines, turning Taiwan into an American colony. Now, Taiwan's industrialists and businessmen are going bankrupt one after another, and the Taiwanese people who grow rice can only eat porridge, sweet potatoes, and sweet potato leaves! The Taiwanese people absolutely cannot tolerate this situation. Zhang Yongli, who went bankrupt, gritted his teeth and said: "Just wait and see, the landing of the People's Liberation Army is victory! Our Taiwanese people will know how to clean up this batch of man-eating beasts!"

　　台湾一定要解放
    ——访旅京台湾同胞
    本报记者  金凤
    美国帝国主义者悍然公开宣布要以直接的军事行动侵略台湾，这就特别激起了台湾人民的愤怒。旅京的台湾同胞，在记者访问他们的时候，纷纷表示了他们这种愤怒的情绪。
    台湾民主自治同盟一位杨志先生，在日本统治时期，曾参加过台湾的农民运动。一九三一年被捕，坐了七年牢。他对于台湾的解放，抱着充分乐观的信心。他有力地说：“美帝国主义算得什么，日本帝国主义就是它的榜样！”
    一心向往着和热爱着自己亲爱祖国的台湾青年，他们是不顾一切、奋勇直前地跑回祖国大陆上来。在最近的日子里，我访问的两个青年男女，原来是台北市立大同中学和台湾省立第一女中的学生，是那千百个青年学生中的两个。他们热情地说：“我们学生一定会像二·二八时候一样，在解放军登陆后协同作战和维持治安的。”
    台湾民主自治同盟另一位盟员周华，原是一位家庭妇女。她正联络着在北京的其他台胞妇女，共同工作、学习、锻炼着自己，准备将来回台湾去做妇运工作。“美国是个纸老虎”，周华轻蔑地说：“看看朝鲜就够了。我们的力量是很大的。三年前美国这样那样地帮助蒋介石来进攻人民，结果还不是被我们人民打垮了。如今我们人民解放军的力量更强大了，全世界和平民主的力量也更加壮大。台湾这一小撮匪徒，是逃不脱他们覆灭的命运的。”
    参加过二·二八斗争的商人张永利，今年二月才离开台湾。他讲述着台湾人民这一年来在残匪和美帝重重剥削和压迫下的灾难生活。首先是台湾六百多万人民要养活一百多万残匪的军政公教人员。算一算，平均每六个人就要养活一个人，这担子怎么挑得起！其次是国民党残匪从日本帝国主义者的手里继承了台湾土地的百分之七十二，成了台湾的大地主，通过商人和中小地主来剥削台湾的三百多万农民。同时美帝又垄断着台湾的经济命脉，控制了蔗糖、樟脑、肥料、药、米、金钢矿等重要企业，使台湾变成美国的殖民地。现在，台湾的工商业家纷纷破产、倒闭，种米的台湾老百姓都只能吃稀粥、山芋和山芋叶子！这种情况是台湾人民绝对容忍不住的。破了产的张永利咬着牙齿说：“等着瞧吧，解放军登陆就是胜利！我们台湾人民会知道怎样收拾这一批吃人野兽的！”
