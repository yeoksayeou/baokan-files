In the city of Mengjin County, Henan Province, at the intersection of the main street, stands the county's New China Bookstore. Its location is prominent. Some people have been eyeing its seven street-facing shops and eight eye-catching display windows, hoping to rent them out for business and make a fortune. However, no one has succeeded.

Once, a superior officer approached the bookstore manager, Xie Jianping, to help someone rent two shops to open a canteen. Xie Jianping jokingly said, "People can't just eat chicken, duck, and fish; they also need spiritual sustenance, otherwise, they'll surely get soft-bone disease!" Another time, an old friend wanted to rent a few display windows to open a shop, claiming that once the business thrived, he would reward Xie Jianping handsomely. Xie Jianping replied, "The display windows are for introducing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and scientific and cultural books to the broad masses of readers. How can they be arbitrarily turned into shops!" Those who came to rent were all turned away empty-handed.

Some people said, "Xie Jianping is stubborn, lacking any spirit of openness and vitality!" Others said, "Old Xie is afraid of being overwhelmed by money." Xie Jianping, however, said, "The Party has entrusted this socialist cultural front to me, and not an inch of it can be lost!" Indeed, over the years, this bookstore has not only not lost an inch but has also added three counters and five bookshelves. It has consistently completed the sales targets assigned by higher authorities and has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced unit at the county, city, and provincial levels.

The front has been firmly occupied. However, some publishing, distribution units, and individuals have tried to push obscene, superstitious, and violent publications onto the bookstore's counters. Xie Jianping has always insisted on taking social benefits as the highest criterion, requiring staff to adhere to the "three nos": not ordering, not stocking, and not selling harmful books. A book peddler from Luoyang once approached Xie Jianping, saying, "As long as the bookstore takes the lead, I can import a batch of books from Hong Kong. After selling them, we can split the profits, giving you ten thousand yuan at once!" Xie Jianping flatly refused. Another time, two young men and women claiming to be from a "peasant painting and calligraphy society" approached the bookstore, requesting help in selling some illegally printed materials and offering to pay 100 yuan in handling fees and 500 yuan in consignment commissions. Old Xie not only refused but also criticized them, saying, "The New China Bookstore is a propaganda front for the Party. Socialist book distributors are not capitalist book dealers. Today, you've come to the wrong place." Over the years, their bookstore has not purchased or sold a single harmful book or magazine.

While refusing to order and sell harmful publications, Xie Jianping has also actively led the staff to distribute various healthy and beneficial books. To meet readers' needs, they implemented open-shelf sales, organized rural mobile service teams to deliver books to villages year-round, and held large-scale book fairs during various township and town gatherings. They also established a book distribution network covering the entire county. Through these methods and channels, they better occupied the cultural market with healthy and beneficial books. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, to help the people of the entire county learn and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the entire staff endured the scorching sun, reaching out to offices, factories, villages, and schools. In just four days, they collected orders for 7,000 copies of the books "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" and "Resolutely Suppress the Counter-Revolutionary Riot" in over 100 units.

    “寸土不让”的谢建平
    王守仁　张英俊
    在河南省孟津县城，大街十字路口坐落着县新华书店，地理位置显赫。一些人眼巴巴地瞅着它的7间临街门市部和8个引人注目的橱窗，想重金租去做生意，赚大钱。然而，谁也没有成功。
    一次，有位顶头上司找到书店经理谢建平，想帮人租两间门市开个食堂。谢建平幽默地说：“人们光吃鸡鸭鱼不行，还得有精神食粮，不然，准会得软骨病哩！”还有一次，有位老朋友想租几个橱窗办商店，并声称生意做阔之后，定用重金酬谢。谢建平说：“橱窗，是向广大顾客介绍马列主义、毛泽东思想和科学文化书籍的，怎能随意改成商店！”前来租赁的人一个个都碰了一鼻子灰。
    有人说：“谢建平，死心眼，没有一点开放搞活精神！”也有人说：“老谢是怕钱多咬住手。”谢建平却说：“党把这块社会主义文化阵地交给了我，一寸也不能丢！”这话当真，几年来，这个书店不但没丢掉一寸，还增添3个柜台和5个书架，年年完成上级交给的销售计划，多次被评为县、市、省先进单位。
    阵地被牢牢占领了。可是，一些出版、发行单位和个人又想使淫秽色情和宗教迷信、凶杀暴力的出版物挤上书店的柜台。谢建平始终坚持以社会效益为最高准则，要求业务人员做到“三不”，即对有害图书不订、不进、不出售。洛阳一书贩曾找到谢建平说：“只要书店出个头，我可以从香港进一批书，销售后两家分红，一次给你一万块！”谢建平断然拒绝。又有一次，两名自称“农民书画社”的男女青年找到书店，请求帮助推销一些非法印刷品，并情愿拿出100元手续费和500元的寄销提成费。老谢不仅拒绝了他们，还批评说：“新华书店是党的宣传阵地，社会主义的图书发行员决不是资本主义的图书商。今天，你们到我这儿，准是摸错了门儿。”多年来，他们的书店对于有害书刊未进一本，未售一册。
    在拒订拒售有害书刊的同时，谢建平还积极带领职工发行多种健康、有益的图书。为了满足读者需要，他们实行了开架售书，组织农村流动服务队，常年下乡送书上门，利用各乡镇集会办大型书展，举办周末夜市，还建立了覆盖全县的图书发行网。通过这些方式和途径，更好地用健康有益的图书占领文化市场。平息北京反革命暴乱之后，为了配合全县人民学习贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，全店人员头顶烈日，深入机关、厂矿、农村、学校，仅用4天时间在100多个单位征订《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》和《坚决平息反革命暴乱》两本书7000余册。
