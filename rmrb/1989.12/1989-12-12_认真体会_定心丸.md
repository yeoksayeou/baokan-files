There was an individual entrepreneur who was fined for tax evasion. Someone told him, "I heard that they want to bankrupt those who get rich first. Look, they're starting with you." This individual entrepreneur believed it and took down his sign and closed his shop.

On September 30, he heard Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary, speak on National Day. He heard the words, "We advocate that under the goal of common prosperity, a part of the people should get rich first through honest labor and legal business operations." He sighed in relief and said, "I've taken another 'heart-setting pill.'" Soon, he resumed his business.

Due to various reasons, some people fear change and fear turmoil. Whenever there is a bit of trouble, they hope for a "heart-setting pill." This is understandable to some extent. But if after taking the "heart-setting pill," one's heart is still not at ease, and one becomes unsettled at the slightest disturbance, it shows that some people have not truly understood the "heart-setting pill." They have only taken the "shell" of the "heart-setting pill," but have not thoroughly chewed the "core" of it.

Someone might ask, what is the "core" of the "heart-setting pill" you mentioned?

In my opinion, it is the basic line of the Party emphasized by Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary, in his National Day speech: taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up. As long as this "one center and two basic points" does not change, even if the specific policies that go with it change, they will only get better and better, and there is no need to be overly concerned.

Therefore, we should not be like the aforementioned individual entrepreneur, only focusing on the wording of certain specific policies. We should deeply understand the Party's basic line and the overall policy and direction of reform and opening up. Only by truly digesting and absorbing this "long-term heart-setting pill" can we "remain calm amidst the storm."

### 认真体会“定心丸”

    认真体会“定心丸”
    陈君华
    有个个体户因为偷漏税被罚款，有人就对他说：“听说要叫先富起来的人破产，这不，对你动手了。”这个个体户信以为真，撤了招牌关了店门。
    9月30日听到江泽民总书记国庆讲话，他听到“我们提倡在共同富裕的目标下，一部分人通过诚实劳动和合法经营先富起来”这句话，长舒了一口气，说：“又吃了一颗‘定心丸’。”很快他恢复营业了。
    由于种种原因，有人怕变，怕折腾，每当有点风浪时，就盼“定心丸”。这在一定情况下是可以理解的。但如果吃了“定心丸”心里还老不踏实，一遇风吹草动还是心神不定，那就说明有些人其实并没有吃透“定心丸”，只是吃了“定心丸”的“外壳”，并没有细嚼“定心丸”的“内瓤”。
    有人会问，你所说的“定心丸”“内瓤”到底是什么？
    依我看，就是江泽民总书记在国庆讲话中强调的党的基本路线，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放。只要这“一个中心两个基本点”不变，与它相配套的具体政策即使有变化，也会越变越好，不必大惊小怪。
    因此，我们不能像上述那位个体户那样，只是盯在某些具体政策的提法上，更要深刻领会党的基本路线和改革开放的总方针、总政策。我们只有真正把这颗“长效定心丸”消化吸收了，才会“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船”。
