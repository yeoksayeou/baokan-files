Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th.

Lin Jianqing reported on the draft of the Residents' Committees Organization Law to the 11th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress.

Lin Jianqing said that during the review of the draft of the Urban Residents' Committees Organization Law by the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, some members suggested deleting the word "production" from the provision in Article 4 that "Residents' Committees should carry out community service activities that are convenient and beneficial to the people, and can establish related production and living service businesses." After the meeting, the Legislative Affairs Commission conducted some investigations in Beijing and held discussions with officials from the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, suburban district governments, the Municipal Women's Federation, and the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. They also sent a telegram to seek opinions from some provinces and municipalities. The Ministry of Civil Affairs also conducted investigations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Officials from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Beijing reported that urban residents' committees establishing some production and living service businesses have facilitated the lives of urban residents, provided employment for some educated youth, disabled persons, and released prisoners, and also generated some income for the residents' committees. Currently, the government subsidies for residents' committees are generally only a few or tens of yuan per month, which is insufficient to maintain normal operations. With the income from production and living service businesses, they can make up for the shortage of operational funds. They believe that residents' committees should mainly focus on establishing living service businesses, and if conditions permit, they can also establish small-scale production service projects as appropriate. The Ministry of Civil Affairs and the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and others suggested retaining the provision that residents' committees can establish related production service businesses. Chengdu City, however, advocated for deleting the provision that residents' committees can establish production service businesses.

He said that the Law Commission discussed this issue. Considering that there are still different opinions and that the situations in various places are not the same, it is suggested to delete the words "production and living" in the provision in Article 4 of the draft, "Residents' Committees should carry out community service activities that are convenient and beneficial to the people, and can establish related production and living service businesses," and modify it to "Residents' Committees should carry out community service activities that are convenient and beneficial to the people, and can establish related service businesses." After this modification, various places can still decide whether to establish production service businesses based on their actual situations, and it is suggested that the Ministry of Civil Affairs and various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government formulate management strengthening measures.

    居委会可否兴办“生产”服务事业
    林涧青就居委会组织法草案作汇报
    新华社北京12月20日电　全国人大法律委员会副主任委员林涧青向今天召开的七届全国人大常委会第十一次会议作了关于城市居民委员会组织法草案是否规定居民委员会可以兴办“生产”服务事业问题的汇报。
    林涧青说，七届全国人大常委会第十次会议审议城市居民委员会组织法草案时，对草案第四条“居民委员会应当开展便民利民的社区服务活动，可以兴办有关的生产生活服务事业”的规定，有的委员建议删去其中的“生产”二字。会后，法制工作委员会在北京市作了一些调查，同北京市人大常委会、城近郊区政府、市妇联和市民政局的同志进行了座谈，并发电征求一些省、市的意见。民政部也在江苏、浙江作了调查。民政部和北京市的同志反映，城市居委会兴办一些生产生活服务事业，方便了城市人民生活；安排了一些知青、残疾人和劳改、劳教释放人员就业；也使居委会有了一些收入。现在各地政府拨给居委会的工作经费一般每月只有几元、十几元，不足以维持正常工作，有了生产生活服务事业的收入，可以补贴工作经费的不足。他们认为，居委会应当以兴办生活服务事业为主，条件允许，也可以因地制宜地搞一些小型的生产服务项目。民政部和北京、上海、天津、武汉、西安、广州等市建议保留可以兴办有关的生产服务事业的规定。成都市则主张删去可以兴办生产服务事业的规定。
    他说，法律委员会对这个问题进行讨论。考虑到对此还有不同意见，各地情况也不一样，建议将草案第四条“居民委员会应当开展便民利民的社区服务活动，可以兴办有关的生产生活服务事业”规定中的“生产生活”四个字删去，修改为“居民委员会应当开展便民利民的社区服务活动，并可以兴办有关的服务事业”。这样规定后，各地仍可以根据实际情况决定是否举办生产服务事业，并建议民政部和各省、自治区、直辖市制定加强管理的办法。
