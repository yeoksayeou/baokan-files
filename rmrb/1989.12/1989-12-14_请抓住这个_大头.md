    Grasp This "Big Head"

    China's land issues are complex, but the main problem is farmers illegally occupying land to build houses. From a micro perspective, today's three short articles provide a glimpse; from a macro perspective, the latest data from the State Land Administration indicates that last year, there were 387,000 cases of illegal land occupation nationwide, with over 90% involving farmers illegally occupying land to build houses.

    To tackle this main issue, consider the following questions: What aspects of China's land use system are unreasonable? Why do phenomena such as disregarding the law and using power to replace the law persist despite repeated bans? It is understood that many local governments have already put the handling of illegal land occupation for housing on their agenda and have found some feasible solutions. We look forward to experiences in this regard.

    请抓住这个“大头”
    我国土地问题头绪纷繁，“大头”还是农民违法占地建房。从微观上看，今天发表的三篇短文可见一斑；从宏观上看，国家土地管理局最新提供的资料表明，去年全国共发生违法占地案件38.7万件，其中90％以上是农民违法占地建房。
    抓住这个“大头”，大家不妨想想这样一些问题：我国土地使用制度有哪些地方不合理？有法不依、以权代法的现象为啥屡禁不绝？据了解，不少地方的政府已将处理违法占地建房问题提上了议事日程，并找到一些可行的办法。我们期待着这方面的经验。
