A telegram from a rural area in Fujian Province was placed before the platoon leader Mao Zhuo Yun and the political instructor Cheng Ya Hu: “Yellow Ming Chan’s family suffered a fire, the house was burned down, and his brother was injured and hospitalized. Please approve his return home to visit.” Mao and Cheng were extremely anxious.

Yellow Ming Chan read the urgent letter from home, and tears streamed down his face.

This scene took place on the morning of November 3 in the camp of the Second Battalion, Tenth Company of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Armed Police Corps.

The news of the misfortune in Yellow Ming Chan’s family quickly spread throughout the camp. Comrades extended their warm hands one after another.

The cook, Luo Wei Hua, handed money and grain tickets to Yellow Ming Chan, saying, “This is a small token from our entire squad. Please accept it.”

Then, the first squad leader, second squad leader, and third squad leader came….

“Ming Chan, this is a small token from the company’s officers and the fourth, fifth, and sixth squads. Please accept it.” The political instructor also comforted him, “The leadership has agreed to let you go home to visit. Please convey our greetings to your parents and brother and sister-in-law on behalf of the company. Take care of your health.”

Cook Zhou Wen Qing, who had just returned from an errand outside, rushed breathlessly to Yellow Ming Chan and handed him the few dozen yuan he had. At this moment, Yellow Ming Chan could no longer hold back his emotions, choking back tears, he said, “Thank you, thank you everyone! I accept everyone’s goodwill, but I cannot accept the money and grain tickets. Everyone is also short on funds, please take them back.”

“Accept it, comrades know you need money now.” The political instructor spoke on behalf of the comrades.

On November 4, Yellow Ming Chan, carrying the deep affection of his comrades, boarded the train heading south.

    战友情深
    王国军　江月法
    一封来自福建农村的电报摆在中队长毛卓云、指导员程亚虎面前：“黄明灿家中因遭火灾，房屋被烧，哥哥被烧伤住院。望中队批准他回家看望。”毛、程二人心急如焚。
    黄明灿看完了特急家书，泪水顺着脸颊直往下流。
    这是11月3日上午发生在武警浙江总队二支队十中队营区的一幕。
    黄明灿家中不幸遭灾的消息即刻传遍营区。战友们一个个伸出了热情之手。
    炊事班长罗为华把钱和粮票交给黄明灿，说：“这是我们全班的一点心意，请收下吧。”
    接着，一班长、二班长、三班长也来了……
    “明灿，这是我们中队干部和四、五、六班战士的一点心意，你收下吧。”指导员还安慰他，“领导上已同意你回家看看。到家后请代表中队向你父母、兄嫂表示问候。你也要保重身体。”
    刚从外面办事回队的炊事员周文庆气喘嘘嘘地跑到黄明灿跟前，将自己仅有的30几元钱塞到他手中。此时此刻，黄明灿再也按捺不住心头的激动，哽咽着说：“谢谢，谢谢大家！大家的心意我收下，但钱、粮票我不能收。大家手头都紧，请拿回去吧。”
    “收下吧，同志们知道你现在需要钱。”指导员代表战友们说话了。
    11月4日，黄明灿带着中队战友们深切的爱，踏上了南归的列车。
