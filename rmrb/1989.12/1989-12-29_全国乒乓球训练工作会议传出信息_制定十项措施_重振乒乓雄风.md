To quickly get out of the current difficulties and improve and develop China's table tennis, and to restore and maintain its advantages, the State Sports Commission will take ten feasible measures, considering both immediate tasks and long-term strategies. This information was obtained by reporters at the recently concluded National Table Tennis Training Conference.

	• Establish a correct evaluation system. The State Sports Commission will establish a scientific evaluation system to correctly evaluate the role of grassroots professional teams based on the number and quality of elite athletes they cultivate for the country, their performance in national competitions, their innovative achievements, and the variety of playing styles they develop.

	• Strengthen the training network at all levels. The State Sports Commission will establish a three-dimensional layout for table tennis nationwide, strengthen team training, and continuously improve the "national unified training, one-stop service" table tennis training system. The State Sports Commission will take measures to clearly define the ages of athletes in the three main levels of youth sports schools, provincial and municipal professional teams, and the national team, to better cultivate promising athletes of all ages.

	• In terms of the variety of playing styles in table tennis, the State Sports Commission has proposed a model of key and non-key teams. The Chinese Table Tennis Association will also organize expert inspection teams to conduct inspections and acceptance checks in various places.

	• In talent cultivation, from the national team to key primary schools, clear responsibilities will be assigned at all levels, with the goal of cultivating world-class players as a common objective for China's table tennis community. Strengthen the reward system to encourage the cultivation of more talents.

	• Strengthen the construction of the coaching team. The State Sports Commission plans to strengthen the coaching team through continuous training of amateur sports school coaches, implementing an in-service training system for coaches, conducting annual assessments of in-service coaches, inviting high-level coaches to give lectures, and creating conditions for provincial and municipal coaches to participate in national and world championship competitions and research activities.

	• Create a scientific research and innovation environment for researchers, so that table tennis scientific research can lead the way in table tennis competitions. The State Sports Commission plans to establish a table tennis scientific research and innovation award, organize table tennis thematic seminars, and organize expert consultations to strengthen table tennis scientific research.

	• Improve the existing domestic competition system, add the "Chinese Olympic Games" and team competition, and strengthen doubles.

	• Further mobilize the role of various social forces to form a supporting system for the overall development of Chinese table tennis.

	• To seek a way out for the development of Chinese table tennis, it is necessary to do a good job in all aspects in international organizations.

	• Integrate political and ideological work into training, competitions, entertainment, emotional exchanges, and cultural learning. Strengthen the education of table tennis athletes on joining the team, traditional history, legal discipline, as well as hard work, ideals, patriotism, collectivism, and other aspects, and focus on improving the cultural quality of athletes.
