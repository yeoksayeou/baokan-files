Like a city thriving in the midst of reform, brimming with talented individuals, the Changzhou Calligraphy and Painting Institute has also developed and produced outstanding talents through reform.

In 1984, amidst the urban reform tide, the Changzhou Calligraphy and Painting Institute broke away from the "iron rice bowl" system and embarked on the path of reform, seeking survival and development. Under the guiding principle of "producing talents, creating works, and taking the right path," the institute shifted from a lifetime employment system for artists to a contract-based system, primarily employing full-time artists while also integrating part-time artists. This approach opened up channels for talent renewal. Over the past five years, the creative level of the Changzhou Calligraphy and Painting Institute has significantly improved, and its economic conditions have steadily enhanced. The institute has had 823 works awarded or published in provincial-level and above exhibitions. This year, 6 individuals with 5 works were selected for the Seventh National Art Exhibition, placing Jiangsu at the forefront and making Changzhou one of the top cities in this regard. The 86 works we recently saw at the "Changzhou Calligraphy and Painting Institute Works Exhibition" at the National Art Museum of China are selected from recent creations. The exhibited works include Chinese ink painting, calligraphy, and seal carving, with ink paintings further categorized into figures, landscapes, and birds and flowers. The themes and styles are diverse and rich.

Mo Shuzhi's creation, "The Road—In Memory of Qu Qiubai," expresses reverence for the martyr and affection for a fellow townsman, depicting the image of Qu Qiubai. Artist Xue Jinwei, who resides in a rural area, uses his brush to describe his beloved land with deep emotions. Que Changshan's calligraphic work "Song of Righteousness" integrates calligraphic and poetic styles, bringing out the righteous spirit of Wen Tianxiang. Wang Rixi's ancient scientist stone carving combines text, image, and carving, offering a fresh and unique perspective.

It is challenging to comment on each of these excellent works with a quick glance, but art circle friends agree that "the works in this exhibition are well-selected and worth appreciating." Although the 86 works in this exhibition are on a small scale, they are far superior to exhibitions that indiscriminately display hundreds of works of varying quality. Using the words of the Tang dynasty poet Liu Yuxi, "Mountains do not need to be high; they are famous if they have immortals. Waters do not need to be deep; they are spiritual if they have dragons," to describe this small exhibition and the small Changzhou Calligraphy and Painting Institute seems appropriate.

    改革后的常州书画院
    王木
    像在改革中蒸蒸日上、能人荟萃的城市一样，常州书画院在改革中发展，人才辈出。
    1984年，常州书画院在城市体制改革的大潮中，也打破了“铁饭碗”，走上了改革之途，在改革中求生存与发展。在“出人，出作品，走正路”的办院宗旨下，书画院改画师终身制为聘用制，以专职为主，实行专、兼职结合的办法，沟通了人才更新的渠道。五年间，常州书画院创作水平大有提高，经济条件也日益改善。书画院在省级以上展览获奖、发表的作品达823件，今年有6人5件作品入选第七届全国美展，名列江苏前茅，在全国中等城市中也是数一数二的。我们近日在中国美术馆《常州书画院作品展览》中看到的86件作品，就是从近年创作中精选出来的。展出的品种有国画、书法和篆刻，国画中又有人物、山水和花鸟，题材风格更是广泛多样。莫树滋创作的《路——为瞿秋白造像》，以对烈士的崇敬，对老同乡的情感描绘出瞿秋白的形象；画师薛金炜家住农村，他用画笔描述自己热恋的土地，情意深长；阙长山的书作《正气歌》，书风与诗风熔成一体，文天祥的浩然正气跃然纸上；王日曦的古代科学家刻石，集文、图、刻于一体，新颖别致。
    仅凭走马观花地参观，要一一评述这些佳作是困难的，但画界朋友都说，“这个展览作品选得很精，耐看。”86件作品在美展中确实是小规模的，但比那种优劣不分，几百件作品一起上的展览要好得多。用唐人刘禹锡的话：“山不在高，有仙则名；水不在深，有龙则灵”，来比喻这次小展览和小小的常州书画院恐怕是合适的。
