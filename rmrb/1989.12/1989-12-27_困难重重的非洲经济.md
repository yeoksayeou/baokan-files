Title: The Struggling Economy of Africa

The economic situation in Africa over the past year has been more severe than ever before. It is estimated that the economic growth rate in Africa this year will be lower than last year. Grain production will decrease by 5%, the trade deficit will continue to rise, the debt burden will become heavier, and the per capita GDP of sub-Saharan African countries will be lower than in 1970. The economic gap between Africa and other regions of the world is widening.

This year and last year, the reporter visited more than ten countries in sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal and Gambia in the north to Zaire and Angola in the south, and heard nothing but "difficulties" everywhere. The shadow of economic recession is visible everywhere: budgets are tight, finances are strained, some factories, shops, and banks have closed... The poor economy has led to serious social problems, with increasing unemployment, rising crime rates, and factors of political instability becoming more pronounced.

There are many reasons why Africa's economy has fallen into such a serious predicament, but the two main ones are heavy debt burdens and falling commodity prices. So far, Africa's total debt has exceeded $240 billion, and it is estimated to reach $600 billion by the year 2000. Some countries' total export earnings are not enough to repay the principal and interest of their annual debts. While rescheduling debts has given some countries a temporary respite, the debt has grown like a snowball, making it even harder to repay. Although some industrialized countries have announced the cancellation of part of the debt of the poorest African countries, the amount is limited, accounting for only 1.6% of Africa's total debt, and is of little help. Due to the sharp rise in debt interest rates in the first half of this year, Africa has taken on new debts of over $100 billion.

At the same time, some Western countries have reduced their aid to Africa, and many African countries have become net capital exporters.

Solving Africa's debt burden as soon as possible and in a comprehensive and reasonable manner is an urgent issue. The Organization of African Unity and African debt-ridden countries have repeatedly called for an international conference on Africa's debt problem to conduct a serious South-North dialogue, but due to the negative attitude of Western creditor countries, and even obstruction, the international conference has been delayed.

Another prominent issue hindering Africa's economic recovery is the irrational international economic order, which has led to a sharp drop in primary commodity prices, causing African countries that rely on raw material exports to suffer huge economic losses.

Last year, except for a slight recovery in oil prices, other products such as cocoa and coffee continued to fall. From January to April this year, the international market prices of these products fell by 11% and 1.5% respectively compared to the same period last year. The price of cocoa is even lower than the cost of production, the more it is exported, the greater the loss to the exporting country. Last year, the decline in cocoa and coffee prices reduced Côte d'Ivoire's export earnings by 600 billion CFA francs (approximately $2 billion) and caused Cameroon a loss of 200 billion CFA francs. In 1988, Gabon's oil export volume increased, but oil export earnings decreased. After the failure of the meetings of the International Coffee Organization and the International Cocoa Organization, the competition for these two products in the international market has been intense, and African countries are at a disadvantage.

It is worth noting that Western industrial countries' trade protectionism has shown signs of further escalation this year.

With the continuous emergence of new technologies and new energy sources, developed countries' dependence on natural resources is decreasing, and sub-Saharan Africa is gradually losing its advantages in raw materials and labor, which is also one of the reasons why Western countries have reduced their aid to Africa.

With the formation of regional economic organizations in the world, especially the realization of the European single market in 1992, the African continent faces a huge challenge.

Therefore, without establishing a just and reasonable new international economic order to maintain primary commodity prices at a level beneficial to producers, it will be difficult for Africa's economy to see a significant turnaround.

In addition, due to heavy debt burdens and severe lack of funds, the economic structural adjustments being carried out by some African countries have encountered increasing difficulties, and so far have achieved only very limited results.

It is undeniable that to fundamentally address the difficulties facing Africa's economy, not only do African countries need to make great efforts, but the international community also needs to provide strong support. A few years ago, the United Nations held a special emergency meeting to discuss Africa's economic situation and adopted the African Recovery Plan. However, this plan has almost become a mere piece of paper, and many of the promises made by industrialized countries have not been fulfilled.

Africa has gone through the 1980s in difficulty and disappointment, and the road ahead in the 1990s seems equally bumpy. Helping Africa out of its current economic predicament and getting it back on the path to development is an urgent task for the international community.

### 困难重重的非洲经济

    困难重重的非洲经济
    本报记者　杨汝生
    在过去的一年中，非洲大陆的经济形势比以往任何时候都更为严峻。据估计，今年非洲的经济增长速度将低于去年，粮食产量减少5％，外贸逆差继续上升，债务负担更为沉重，撒哈拉以南非洲国家的人均国民生产总值将低于1970年。非洲与世界上其他地区在经济上的差距愈拉愈大。
    今年和去年，记者曾访问了10余个黑非洲国家，从北部的塞内加尔、冈比亚到偏南部的扎伊尔和安哥拉，听到的皆是一片“困难”之声，经济衰退的阴影随处可见：预算紧缩，财政吃紧，一些工厂、商店和银行倒闭……经济不佳带来严重的社会问题，失业人数增多，犯罪率上升，政局不稳定的因素明显增加。
    非洲经济陷入严重困境的原因颇多，但最主要的有两个：债务负担沉重和原料价格下跌。迄今为止，非洲的债务总额已逾2400亿美元，预计到2000年将达6000亿美元。有些国家的全部出口收入还不够偿还当年债务的本息。重新安排债务虽使一些国家得到暂时喘息的机会，但债款却因此像雪球一样越滚越大，将更加无力偿还。某些工业国家虽然宣布取消最穷非洲国家的部分债务，但数量有限，仅占非洲债务的1.6％，无济于事。由于今年上半年债务利率急剧上升，非洲又负新债100多亿美元。
    与此同时，一些西方国家削减了援非基金，不少非洲国家已成为净资本输出国。
    早日全面合理地解决非洲的债务负担，已是迫在眉睫的问题。非统组织和非洲债务国虽多次呼吁召开关于非洲债务问题的国际会议，进行认真的南北对话，但因西方债权国持消极态度，甚至进行阻挠，国际会议迟迟未能召开。
    阻碍非洲经济复苏的另一突出问题是不合理的国际经济秩序导致初级产品价格剧跌，使依赖原料出口的非洲国家蒙受巨大经济损失。
    去年，除石油价格略有回升外，其他产品如可可、咖啡等持续下跌。今年1至4月，上述产品的国际市场价格又比去年同期分别下降了11％和1.5％。可可价格甚至低于成本，出口的愈多，给出口国带来的损失愈大。去年可可、咖啡价格下跌，使科特迪瓦的出口收入减少了6000亿西非法郎（约合20亿美元），给喀麦隆造成的损失有2000亿西非法郎。1988年加蓬的石油出口数量增加，石油出口收入却在减少。国际咖啡组织和可可组织的会议相继失败后，这两种产品在国际市场上竞争十分激烈，非洲国家则处于不利地位。
    值得注意的是，西方工业国家的贸易保护主义今年有进一步抬头之势。
    随着新技术、新能源的不断出现，发达国家对自然资源的依赖程度减少，黑非洲正在日益丧失原料和劳动力的优势，这也是西方国家减少援非资金的原因之一。
    随着世界地区性经济组织的形成，尤其是1992年欧洲大市场的实现，非洲大陆面临巨大的挑战。
    所以，不建立公正合理的国际经济新秩序，使初级产品维持在对生产者有利的水平上，非洲经济很难出现大的转机。
    此外，由于债务负担沉重，资金严重不足等原因，一些非洲国家正在进行的经济结构调整也遇到了越来越大的困难，迄今为止仅取得了极其有限的成果。
    毋庸讳言，要从根本上对困难重重的非洲经济加以治理，不仅需要非洲国家作出极大的努力，尤其需要国际社会的大力支援。几年前联合国曾专门召开过讨论非洲经济形势的紧急大会，并通过了非洲复兴计划。但这个计划几乎成了一纸空文，工业发达国家所作的许多承诺未能兑现。
    非洲在困难和失望之中度过了本世纪的80年代，90年代的道路看来将同样坎坷。帮助非洲摆脱当前的经济困境，使其重新走上发展之路，乃是当前国际社会的一项紧迫任务。
