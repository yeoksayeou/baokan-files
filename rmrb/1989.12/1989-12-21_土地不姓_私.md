    Land Does Not Belong to Private Individuals

    The land laws of our country clearly stipulate: Urban land within city limits belongs to the state, that is, to the whole people. In rural areas and urban suburbs, except for land that the law stipulates belongs to the state, land belongs to the collective. Residential plots and private plots of land, as well as private hills, belong to the collective. This clearly indicates that our country practices a socialist public ownership system for land, and that land in our country does not belong to private individuals.

    It is very important to make this clear. In recent years, the state has imposed some restrictions on the land used by farmers for building houses, but the desired results have not been achieved. Among the various factors, the deeply ingrained notion among farmers that residential plots belong to private individuals is the main reason. Farmers have long occupied residential plots without any cost, taking more or less, taking good or bad plots, with no constraints whatsoever. How can they cherish every inch of land under these circumstances? Therefore, we are publishing the experience of the Dezhou Municipal Committee for further discussion.

    土地不姓“私”
    我国的土地法明确规定：城市市区的土地属于全民所有即国家所有。农村和城市郊区的土地，除法律规定属于国家所有的以外，属于集体所有；宅基地和自留地、自留山，属于集体所有。这就十分清楚地表明，我国实行土地所有的社会主义公有制，我国的土地不姓“私”。
    明确这一点非常重要。最近几年来，国家对农民建房用地作了一些限制，但仍未收到理想的效果。在诸多因素中，农民对宅基地私有的观念根深蒂固是主要的。农民长期无偿占用宅基地，占多占少，占好占坏，没有一点约束，怎能做到珍惜每一寸土地呢？所以，我们发表德州地委的经验，供大家进一步讨论。
