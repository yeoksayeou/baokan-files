Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 30th. People's Daily reporters Wang Yanbin and Chen Jian report: The collection of the land occupation tax across the country has been slow, with overdue taxes amounting to tens of billions of yuan. Vice Minister of Finance Xiang Huicheng yesterday urged local governments to quickly pay the overdue land occupation tax.

Xiang Huicheng pointed out that the collection of the land occupation tax nationwide has not been ideal. Some places do not report the occupation of land, do not actively collect the occupation tax, or collect it but do not remit it to the national treasury according to the prescribed ratio, or arbitrarily grant tax exemptions. Some large land users have serious overdue taxes, with industries such as highways, hydropower, and coal mines owing over 1.3 billion yuan in unpaid land occupation tax. This year, the national plan was to collect 3.5 billion yuan in land occupation tax, of which 1 billion yuan was to be remitted to the central finance. In the first 10 months of this year, the actual amount collected nationwide was 907 million yuan, completing 25.9% of the annual plan, of which 194 million yuan was remitted to the central finance, completing 19.4% of the annual plan.

The land occupation tax is the main source of funds for China's agricultural development. If it is not collected, it cannot be disbursed, directly affecting the progress of agricultural development work. Xiang Huicheng introduced that the General Office of the State Council, in its notice forwarding the "Report on the Agricultural Development Situation in the Huanghuaihai Plain and Northeast Region," solemnly pointed out: "All regions and departments must support this cause with concrete actions, especially to grasp the collection of the land occupation tax. For highways, hydropower, coal, and other industries occupying farmland, the tax law must be strictly enforced. The collection of the land occupation tax should be included in the annual tax, financial, and price inspections, and units that do not pay the land occupation tax according to the tax law should be held accountable by the responsible persons of the units and their superior management units." Vice Minister Xiang Huicheng requires local governments to further strengthen leadership and grasp this work. The financial departments should expedite the collection, the land management departments should actively cooperate, and the superior management departments of large tax defaulters should actively supervise their subordinate units to pay taxes according to the law, and pay within the deadline.

At the national agricultural comprehensive development experience exchange meeting convened by the State Council, Xiang Huicheng also especially hoped that the leaders of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions would work together to support this work. He said, "We must work together from top to bottom to strive to complete this year's land occupation tax collection task."

    财政部副部长敦促各地
    速交耕地占用税
    本报北京11月30日讯　新华社记者王言彬、本报记者陈健报道：全国各地耕地占用税征收进展缓慢，拖欠税款达几十亿元。财政部副部长项怀诚昨天敦促各地，尽快交纳拖欠的耕地占用税。
    项怀诚指出，全国耕地占用税征收不够理想。有的地方占用耕地不报，不积极征收占用税，或征了不按规定比例上交国库，或随意开减免税口子。一些占地大户拖欠税款比较严重，公路、水电、煤矿等行业的纳税大户，现在欠交的耕地占用税有13亿多元。今年全国计划征收耕地占用税35亿元，其中上交中央财政10亿元。今年前10个月全国实际入库9.07亿元，完成年计划的25.9％，其中上交中央财政1.94亿元，完成年计划的19.4％。
    耕地占用税是我国农业发展基金的主要来源，收不上来就支不出去，直接影响农业开发工作的进度。项怀诚介绍说，国务院办公厅在转发《关于黄淮海平原、东北地区农业开发情况的报告》的通知中严肃指出：“各地区、各部门都要用实际行动支持这项事业，尤其要切实抓好耕地占用税的征收工作，对公路、水电、煤炭等行业占用耕地，要严格按税法征收。对耕地占用税的征收情况，要列为每年税收、财务、物价大检查的内容，对不按税法规定交纳耕地占用税的单位，要追究单位负责人及其上级主管单位的责任。”项怀诚副部长要求各地进一步加强领导，切实抓好这项工作，财政部门要抓紧征收，土地管理部门要积极配合，欠税大户主管部门要主动督促所属单位照章纳税，限期缴纳。
    项怀诚在国务院召开的全国农业综合开发经验交流会上，还特别希望各省、市、自治区领导，合力支持这一工作。他说，我们上上下下要齐心协力，努力完成今年的耕地占用税征收任务。
