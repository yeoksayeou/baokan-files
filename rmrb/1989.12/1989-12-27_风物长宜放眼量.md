	In any job, of course, one must achieve results and produce outcomes, especially in economic work, where the ultimate goal is to achieve results and benefits. However, how to achieve good results is a matter of great importance. The reader's letter published here points out that one must avoid short-term behavior in work, which is worthy of attention by all industries.

	The various types of work in society, despite their differing natures, have one common point: they must follow scientific laws, set feasible goals, seek the best action plans, and take effective implementation measures. To achieve these, decision-makers must have the quality of "looking at things from a long-term perspective," being far-sighted and considering both the past and the future. In other words, when setting feasible goals, one must have both long-term planning and short-term arrangements; in implementation measures, one must consider both the present and the future. In this way, all our work can proceed in an orderly, solid, and healthy manner.

	In the course of reform, some units have adopted plundering, overexploiting, and short-sighted management methods—short-term behavior—that cannot but cause concern. Because this is an irresponsible act. Overemphasizing immediate interests and personal achievements often leads to superficial, showy, and shallow actions, lacking a sense of responsibility towards the country, society, and history. It brings about negative consequences for future work, hinders the development of the cause, and may even lead to the collapse of certain work. In the process of rectification and adjustment, it is important to overcome short-term behavior. When considering problems, all levels of leadership should broaden their vision, and combine personal and collective interests with national and social interests, as well as immediate and long-term interests.

### 风物长宜放眼量

    风物长宜放眼量
    干什么工作，当然是要讲出成绩、出成果，尤其是经济工作，讲效益、出成果是最终目的。但是，怎样才能出好成果，里边则大有学问。这里发表的读者来信指出，切忌工作中的短期行为，值得各行各业重视。
    社会上的各种工作尽管性质千差万别，衡量的效果也各有不同，但有一个共同点，就是必须按照科学规律办事，确定可行性目标，寻求最佳行动方案，采取有效实施措施。而要做到这些，决策者必须具有“风物长宜放眼量”的素质，高瞻远瞩，瞻前顾后。也就是说，在确定可行性目标时，既要有长远规划，又要有近期打算；在实施措施上，既要顾眼前，又要看将来。这样，我们的各项工作就能有条不紊、坚实健康地不断向前。
    在改革中，一些单位采取掠夺式的、竭泽而渔急功近利的经营办法——短期行为，不能不令人忧虑。因为，这是一种不负责任的表现。过分追求眼前利益、个人成就，难免出现华而不实、哗众取宠之作，简单粗暴、草率浅薄之举，缺乏对国家的、社会的、历史的责任感，给今后工作带来后遗症，影响事业的发展，甚至可以使某项工作陷入绝境。在治理整顿中，要重视克服短期行为。各级领导机关考虑问题时，要把眼光放远些，把个人、集体利益与国家、社会利益，眼前利益与长远利益结合起来。
