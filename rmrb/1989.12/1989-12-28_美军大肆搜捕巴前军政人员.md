The U.S. military continues to conduct widespread arrests of military and political figures from the Noriega regime in Panama, and has deported some of them to the United States.

According to reports, 15 former National Guard officers, including former Chiriquí Military Zone Commander Colonel Del Cid, have been deported to the United States by the U.S. military on charges of being "Noriega's drug trafficking accomplices." Additionally, reliable sources indicate that former National Guard second-in-command, Chief of Staff Colonel Marcos, has been arrested, as well as former Minister of Commerce Ronioni and former Minister of Finance Godin.

Noriega and his 32 followers remain in hiding at the Vatican embassy in Panama.
