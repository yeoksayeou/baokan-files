Liaoning Province Leaders Visit Liaoning Athletes Training for the Asian Games in Beijing
Call for Diligence in Training and Compliance with Arrangements

BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) — Correspondent Wang Da Zhao reports: Vice Governor Wang Wenyuan of Liaoning Province and Director Li Xiaosheng of the Provincial Sports Commission, along with other officials, visited the State Sports Commission Training Bureau today to meet with Liaoning athletes training for the Asian Games. They conveyed the warm greetings and sincere expectations of the 38 million people back home.

Liaoning is one of China's leading sports provinces. It is understood that among the 1,400 athletes currently in national training camps preparing for next year's Asian Games, 139 are from Liaoning, accounting for one-tenth of the total. This includes 13 coaches and 126 athletes, covering 21 different sports. Their performance will directly affect the overall results of the Chinese delegation, making them a crucial factor.

During a meeting with the athletes, Asian sports stars and coaches such as Zhou Zhenshan, Jin Ling, Ma Yongfeng, Yu Shentong, and Wang Yifu expressed their determination to train hard and bring honor to their country and hometown in the Asian Games. What moved some officials of the State Sports Commission was that Liaoning Province not only provided the national team with many outstanding athletes but also proposed, in the interest of the greater good, that next year, all Liaoning teams and athletes participating in various national competitions should prioritize the Asian Games training schedule. They will not consider the gains or losses of a single province or region, fully demonstrating their sense of responsibility and selflessness.

    辽宁省领导在京看望亚运会集训的辽宁籍选手
    提出要刻苦训练服从安排
    本报北京十二月六日讯  记者汪大昭报道：辽宁省副省长王文元、省体委主任李孝生等，今天来到国家体委训练局，看望正在这里参加亚运会集训的辽宁省籍体育健儿，向他们转达三千八百万家乡父老的亲切问候和殷切嘱托。
    辽宁是我国体育强省之一。据了解，备战明年亚运会的国家集训队一千四百人当中，辽宁籍的有一百三十九人之多，占去十分之一，其中包括十三名教练员和一百二十六名运动员，分属二十一个项目。他们的表现将直接影响中国代表团的总成绩，可谓举足轻重。
    在慰问团与运动员进行的座谈会上，邹振先、金玲、马永峰、于沈潼、王义夫等亚洲体坛名将和教练员先后发言，决心刻苦训练，在亚运会上为祖国和家乡争得荣誉。令国家体委一些负责人感动不已的是辽宁省不仅为国家队输送了众多优秀选手，而且当面提出以大局为重，明年辽宁各队和运动员参加各项全国比赛，如与亚运会集训有矛盾，一律服从亚运会集训的安排，不计较一省一地的得失。
