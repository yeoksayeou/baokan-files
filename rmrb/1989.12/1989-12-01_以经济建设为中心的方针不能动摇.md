The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party made the strategic decision to shift the focus of the Party's work to the construction of socialist modernization, marking another great turning point in the history of the Party. The recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "In the ten years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have focused on economic construction, adhered to the four cardinal principles, and pursued reform and opening up. The national economy has sustained development, the country's economic strength has significantly increased, the living standards of urban and rural residents have improved markedly, and all aspects of work have achieved tremendous successes. The overall appearance of the country has undergone profound historical changes." Studying the communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session and reviewing the progress and development of our country over the past ten years are of great practical significance and importance for fully and correctly implementing the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," clarifying and correcting confusion and errors in thought and work.

The shift in the focus of the Party's work is a correct decision made by the Party using the historical materialist perspective of Marxism to deeply summarize and learn from the twists and turns and the enormous price paid in the thirty years after the founding of the nation. The practice of the past ten years has proven that without the shift in the focus of the Party's work, China would still be mired in the frequent political movements of the "class struggle as the key link," there would be no reform and opening up today, and such tremendous construction achievements would not have been achieved. The shift in the focus of the Party's work marks the beginning of a new stage of historical development.

As history progresses, the line, principles, and policies determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have been continuously enriched and developed in practice. However, due to the rise of some erroneous ideas within and outside the Party in recent years, our construction and reform undertakings have been subjected to relatively serious interference and impact. After the turmoil in Beijing, the Party Central Committee proposed that the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee must not change. Therefore, we must clarify what we need to adhere to in upholding the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

I believe that adhering to the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is to continue focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and pursuing reform and opening up, which is "one center, two basic points." The core remains the vigorous development of productive forces and the construction of socialist modernization. It should be recognized that "one center, two basic points" as a whole constitute the Party's basic line. If any part is abandoned or weakened, it will deviate from the Party's line and be incomplete. In recent years, we have lacked consistency in adhering to the four cardinal principles, and even talked about them less, which is a major mistake.

Currently, we emphasize adhering to the four cardinal principles, and people discuss the relationship between the "two basic points" more, giving it more attention. Undoubtedly, this is very correct and necessary. However, there is less thought and discussion about the relationship between the "two basic points" and the "one center." In fact, while clarifying the relationship between the "two basic points," we must also understand the relationship between the "two basic points" and the "one center." If we do not do this, we may make our work go from one extreme to another. In understanding and grasping the Party's line, principles, and policies, we should strive for comprehensiveness and accuracy, avoid one-sidedness, and absolutely not "create a wind" or "bend over." We have paid a heavy price for this in the past, and we should learn from these lessons.

Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China eloquently expounded on the relationship between the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up. Then, what is the relationship between the "two basic points" and the "one center"? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that in the future, the main task is to focus on construction, and all the Party's work must serve and be subordinate to the center of economic construction. This means that the "two basic points" serve the "one center" and are the basic guarantee for implementing the "one center." Without the development of economic construction, the four cardinal principles would be like a building on sand and difficult to stabilize; reform and opening up would lose its purpose.

History and reality repeatedly tell us that the foundation for solving international and domestic problems is to develop the economy. Without strong economic strength, nothing can be accomplished. The prosperity of the state and the prosperity of the people ultimately come down to economic strength. International competition ultimately comes down to economic strength. Only when the economy develops and national strength increases can we achieve national rejuvenation and make greater contributions to humanity.

In short, with one heart and one mind, we will realize the four modernizations. This is the overriding task for the people of the entire country for a fairly long period in the future. We must not waver in our belief and determination to focus on economic construction just because a turmoil has occurred.

It should be noted that due to the mistakes in economic work in recent years, the current economic situation is severe. The prominent problem is that inflation has become more pronounced, prices have risen sharply, and the national economy is in an unstable state. The rectification and adjustment over the past year have achieved some results, but some deep-seated problems in the economy have not been solved, and some latent contradictions continue to surface. What are these deep-seated and latent contradictions? In summary, they are total imbalance, accompanied by profound structural contradictions. According to relevant analyses, the main manifestations of the current economic problems are:

(1) Social total demand far exceeds total supply. The current national strength and social production capacity of our country cannot support the huge construction scale that has been laid out and is being laid out, and the excessively high social consumption demand that has been hyped up in recent years. From 1984 to 1988, national income increased by an average of 12% per year (19.9% in current prices); the total fixed asset investment of the whole society increased by an average of 25.7% per year; the average annual increase in urban residents' monetary income was 24%. The dual inflation of investment and consumption demand is to a large extent supported by eating up old capital, running deficits, and issuing a large amount of currency. If a few years ago it could still be barely supported, it will definitely not be able to be supported in the next few years.

(2) Economic structural contradictions are prominent. The current supply capacity of agriculture, basic industries, and infrastructure in our country cannot support the excessively large industrial production scale that has already formed. Now, grain, cotton, coal, electricity, and transportation are all very tight. This reflects the serious imbalance in the proportion of industry to agriculture, processing industry to basic industry, and production to transportation.

For this unreasonable economic structure, the state has proposed clear adjustment opinions and wishes in recent years, but it is difficult to see real results in the short term. Even what should be suppressed is still expanding, and what should be strengthened is still relatively weakening; the weaker the link, the less it is strengthened; where the focus is, the greater the difficulties. Now, some important products related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and industries and undertakings related to the long-term development of the economy and society, are all in a predicament.

(3) The current production and construction framework that has been opened up is not only beyond the domestic financial and material strength to bear, but the room for maneuvering by borrowing more foreign debts and increasing imports is also small. Some Western countries, after our country's suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, imposed economic sanctions on our country, which will inevitably affect the assistance of external forces and increase economic difficulties.

(4) The above situations all lead to the deterioration of the social benefits of economic activities, and high consumption and low efficiency are the crux of the difficulties in economic life. Undoubtedly, the speed of our country's economic construction is relatively fast, but this speed is achieved through the large-scale input of manpower, financial resources, and materials, and the economic benefits are very low. That is, our national economy is in a state of high growth and low efficiency. The result is that per capita national income can only hover at a low level for a long time, making it difficult to enhance our comprehensive national power.

This low-efficiency high-speed economic growth brings only superficial prosperity. Some people call this economic form "economic hollowing out," which means that the proportion of reproducible social wealth in the current total social wealth is getting lower and lower, ultimately making it difficult for the material foundation on which society depends to support social demand, thus affecting the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

From the above situation, we can logically conclude:

- After the shift in the focus of the Party's work to economic construction, it does not mean that all problems in economic work have been solved. The problems and difficulties that appear in real economic life can only be solved in the long term through unremitting hard work under the premise of adhering to the focus on economic construction. If we abandon or weaken the policy of focusing on economic construction, it will only exacerbate difficulties and contradictions and ultimately affect stability and unity. Therefore, the policy of focusing on economic construction must not waver or change at any time or under any circumstances.

- When emphasizing the problem of "one hand hard, one hand soft," we must adopt a scientific attitude and act according to dialectics. The originally soft hand should be made hard, and the originally relatively hard hand should continue to be strengthened and cannot be made soft. The key to correctly handling the appropriate speed of economic construction and the "overheating" in economic construction is to grasp this degree. The necessary and appropriate speed in economic construction is beneficial to the long-term development of the national economy and maximizes the satisfaction of people's growing material and cultural needs. This appropriate speed is the goal we hope for and pursue. While the "overheating" in economic construction is to pursue low-efficiency high speed regardless of national strength, to blindly construct and produce regardless of the needs of the people and society. This "overheating" phenomenon must be resolutely cooled down. In a period of time, the construction of the Party and ideological and political work has been weakened, so it is very important to strengthen the construction of the Party and ideological and political work. This strengthening will promote and guide the healthy development of economic construction. However, in the leadership's thinking, we must not reduce the reasonable speed needed for economic construction because of emphasizing this point, and go from one extreme to another. Otherwise, we will make historical mistakes.

- Facing the difficulties and complex contradictions in economic work, it is not a dead end. The difficulties we face are indeed difficulties in progress, and we should not be pessimistic and helpless, doing nothing. We should have such a realization that seeing the problem is to find a way out, and encountering contradictions is to encounter a turning point. Now, as long as we rally our spirits, unite as one, take active actions, and seriously carry out rectification and adjustment and deepen reform, we can make the economic life return to a scientific and orderly track, and we can get out of the predicament and achieve a new leap.

- The long-term stability of the state, the cohesion of the Party, and the attractiveness of socialism all depend on the gradual realization of the modernization goal. Economic problems, when developed to a certain extent, will inevitably become social problems. This is a historical lesson. The enhancement of the Party's prestige and cohesion cannot be achieved through slogans, but through effective solutions to real problems, through correct leadership and effective organization of economic construction. "Poverty is not socialism," and a poor socialism cannot be sustained. If we cannot get rid of poverty, the superiority of socialism cannot be fully demonstrated, and we cannot confidently say that socialism is superior to capitalism. Therefore, we must adhere to the focus on economic construction, vigorously develop productive forces, and strive to achieve the modernization goal of socialism according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's design of the "three steps." Only in this way, no matter how big the waves are at home and abroad, our Party and country can stand unshakable.

专栏：学习党的十三届五中全会公报笔谈

    以经济建设为中心的方针不能动摇
    黑龙江省省长  邵奇惠
    党的十一届三中全会，作出了把全党工作的着重点转移到社会主义现代化建设上来的战略决策，实现了党的历史上的又一次伟大转折。最近召开的党的十三届五中全会指出：“党的十一届三中全会以来的十年中，我们以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，国民经济持续发展，国家经济实力显著增强，城乡居民生活明显改善，各项事业都取得了巨大成就，整个国家的面貌发生了深刻的历史性变化。”学习五中全会公报，回顾我国十年来前进和发展的历程，对于全面地、正确地贯彻执行“一个中心，两个基本点”这一党的基本路线，澄清和纠正思想上和工作上的混乱与失误，具有非常重要的现实意义和作用。
    实行党的工作重心的转移，这是我们党运用马克思主义的历史唯物主义观点，深刻地总结和汲取了建国后前三十年所经历的曲折和付出的巨大代价后，做出的正确决策。十年来的实践证明，没有党的工作重心的转移，中国仍将陷于“以阶级斗争为纲”的频繁的政治运动的灾难之中，不会有今天的改革开放，也不能取得如此巨大的建设成就。实行党的工作重心的转移，这是一个新的历史发展阶段的开端。
    随着历史的前进，党的十一届三中全会确定的路线、方针、政策，在实践中得到不断丰富和发展。但是，由于近几年党内外一些错误思想的泛起，使我们的建设和改革事业受到了比较严重的干扰和影响。北京这场风波过后，党中央提出十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策都不能变。所以，我们必须搞清楚，坚持十一届三中全会以来的路线，究竟要坚持什么？
    我认为，坚持党的十一届三中全会以来的路线，就是要继续以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，也就是“一个中心，两个基本点”。其核心仍然是大力发展生产力，建设社会主义四个现代化。应该认识到，“一个中心，两个基本点”作为一个整体构成了党的基本路线，丢掉或削弱了哪一点，都会偏离党的这一路线，是不全面的。而这几年，我们在坚持四项基本原则这一方面缺乏一贯性，甚至讲得都很少，这是很大的失误。
    目前，我们强调坚持四项基本原则，人们对“两个基本点”的关系议论得比较多，给予了较充分的注意。无疑，这是十分正确和非常必要的。但是，对“两个基本点”同“一个中心”的关系思考较少，议论也不多。其实，在搞清“两个基本点”的关系的同时，还必须弄明白“两个基本点”同“一个中心”的关系。如果不这样去做，就可能使我们的工作从一个极端走上另一个极端。对于党的路线、方针、政策的领会和把握，应该力求全面、准确，切忌片面性，更不能“刮风”、“折个子”。在这一点上，我们曾付出过沉重的代价，这方面的教训应牢牢汲取。
    江泽民同志《在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年大会上的讲话》中，十分精辟地阐明了四项基本原则同改革开放的关系。那么，“两个基本点”同“一个中心”是什么关系呢？小平同志指出，今后的主要任务是搞建设，党的各项工作都必须服从和服务于经济建设这个中心。这就是说，“两个基本点”是为“一个中心”服务的，是实行“一个中心”的基本保证。没有经济建设的发展，四项基本原则就如建在沙滩上的大厦而难以稳固；改革开放就失去了目的。
    历史和现实一再告诉我们，解决国际国内问题的基础，是把经济搞上去，没有雄厚的经济实力，任何事情都办不成。国家的昌盛，人民的富裕，说到底是经济实力问题。国际间的竞争，说到底也是经济实力的竞争。经济发展了，国力强大了，才能实现民族振兴，对人类作出更大贡献。
    一言概之，同心同德实现四个现代化，是今后一个相当长时期内全国人民压倒一切的中心任务。我们绝不能因为出现了一场风波，就动摇了坚持以经济建设为中心的信念和决心。
    应该看到，由于近几年来经济工作中的失误，目前的经济形势是严峻的。突出的问题是，通货膨胀明显加剧，物价大幅度上涨，国民经济处于不稳定状态。一年来的治理整顿，虽然取得一定成效，但是经济中一些深层次的问题还没有得到解决，一些潜伏着的矛盾还在继续暴露。这些深层次和潜伏着的矛盾是什么呢？概括起来说是总量失衡，伴随着深刻的结构性矛盾。据有关方面分析，当前经济问题的主要表现是：
    （一）社会总需求大大超过总供给。我国现有国力和社会生产能力，支撑不了已经铺开与正在铺开的庞大的建设规模和近几年哄抬起来的过高社会消费需求。从1984年到1988年，国民收入平均每年增长12％（按现价计算为19.9％）；全社会固定资产投资平均每年增长25.7％；城镇居民货币收入平均每年增长24％。投资和消费需求双膨胀，在很大程度上是靠吃老本、打赤字，大量发票子支持的。如果说，前几年还可以勉强支撑一下，今后几年无论如何也支持不下去了。
    （二）经济结构矛盾突出。我国现有的农业、基础工业和基础设施的供给能力，支撑不了已经形成起来的过大的工业生产摊子。现在，粮、棉、煤、电、运力等都十分紧张。这反映出工业与农业、加工工业与基础工业、生产与运输之间的比例关系严重失调。
    对于这种不合理的经济结构，近年来国家曾提出了明确的调整意见和愿望，但短期内还难收到实效，甚至该抑制的却仍在膨胀，该增强的继续在相对减弱；越是薄弱环节，越是得不到加强；哪里是重点，哪里的困难就越大。现在一些关系到国计民生的重要产品，关系到经济、社会长远发展的产业和事业，都处于困境之中。
    （三）现在拉开的生产和建设的架子，不仅国内财力、物力承受不住，靠多借外债、增加进口的回旋余地也小了。西方一些国家在我国制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱后，对我国进行经济制裁，也必然影响外力的借助，增加了经济上的困难。
    （四）上述这些情况，都导致经济活动的社会效益恶化，而高消耗、低效益又是经济生活中困难重重的症结所在。不容置疑，我国经济建设的速度是比较快的，但这种速度是靠人、财、物力的大量的投入，其经济效益很低。就是说我国的国民经济处于高增长与低效益并存的状态。它造成的结果，就是人均国民收入在很长时期只能在一个低水平上徘徊，使我们的综合国力难以增强。
    这种低效益的经济高速增长，带来的只能是表面繁荣。有的人把这种经济形态称之为“经济空心化”，即是指，可增殖的社会财富占现在社会全部财富的比重越来越低，最终导致社会赖以生存的物质基础难以支撑社会的需求，从而影响国民经济持续、稳定、协调地发展。
    从上述情况中，我们可以合乎逻辑地得出这样的结论：
    ——党的工作重心转移到以经济建设为中心的轨道上来后，并不等于经济工作上的问题就全部解决了。现实经济生活中出现的问题和困难，只有在坚持以经济建设为中心的前提下，通过长期不懈的艰苦奋斗，才能得到切实解决。如果放弃或削弱以经济建设为中心的方针，只能使困难和矛盾加剧，最终会影响到安定团结。所以，坚持以经济建设为中心的方针，在任何时候、任何情况下都不能动摇，不能改变。
    ——在强调解决“一手硬一手软”这个问题的时候，要采取科学态度，按辩证法办事。原来软的一手要硬起来，原来比较硬的一手还应继续加强，不能使硬变软。正确处理好经济建设的适当速度同经济建设中的“过热”，关键是要把握好这个度。在经济建设中必要的适当的速度，有利于国民经济的长远发展，最大限度满足人们日益增长的物质文化的需要。这种适当速度是我们所希望和追求的目标。而经济建设中的“过热”则是不顾国力去搞低效益的高速度，不顾人民和社会需要去盲目建设、盲目生产。对这种“过热”现象要坚决使其降温。一个时期来，党的建设和思想政治工作受到削弱，因此，加强党的建设和思想政治工作是十分重要的。这种加强，必将推动并引导经济建设的健康发展。但在领导思想上绝不能因为强调这一点而把经济建设上需要的合理的速度降下来，从一个极端走上另一个极端。那样，我们就要犯历史性的错误。
    ——面对经济工作中的困难和复杂矛盾，并非无路可走。我们面临的困难毕竟是前进中的困难，不能因此而悲观失望，无所作为。要有这样的认识，看清问题就能找到出路，碰到矛盾就是遇到转机。现在只要振作精神，上下一心，积极行动，认认真真地治理整顿和深化改革，使经济生活走上科学的有秩序的轨道，我们就能够从困境中走出来，实现新的腾跃。
    ——国家的长治久安、党的凝聚力、社会主义的吸引力，都有赖于现代化目标的逐步实现。经济问题发展到一定程度必然成为社会问题，这是一条历史的教训。党的威信和凝聚力的增强，不能凭口号，而要靠对现实问题的有效解决，靠对经济建设的正确领导和有效组织。“贫穷不是社会主义”，贫穷的社会主义是不能持久的。如果不能摆脱贫困，社会主义优越性就不能充分发挥，我们就不能理直气壮地说社会主义优于资本主义。所以，我们必须坚持经济建设为中心，大力发展社会生产力，按照小平同志设计的“三部曲”，去努力实现社会主义的现代化目标。只有这样，无论国内外出现多么大的风浪，我们的党和国家都能立于不败之地。
