The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party made the strategic decision to shift the focus of the Party's work to the construction of socialist modernization, marking another great turning point in the history of the Party. The recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "In the ten years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have focused on economic construction, adhered to the four cardinal principles, and pursued reform and opening up. The national economy has sustained development, the country's economic strength has significantly increased, the living standards of urban and rural residents have improved markedly, and all aspects of work have achieved tremendous successes. The overall appearance of the country has undergone profound historical changes." Studying the communiqu√© of the Fifth Plenary Session and reviewing the progress and development of our country over the past ten years are of great practical significance and importance for fully and correctly implementing the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," clarifying and correcting confusion and errors in thought and work.

The shift in the focus of the Party's work is a correct decision made by the Party using the historical materialist perspective of Marxism to deeply summarize and learn from the twists and turns and the enormous price paid in the thirty years after the founding of the nation. The practice of the past ten years has proven that without the shift in the focus of the Party's work, China would still be mired in the frequent political movements of the "class struggle as the key link," there would be no reform and opening up today, and such tremendous construction achievements would not have been achieved. The shift in the focus of the Party's work marks the beginning of a new stage of historical development.

As history progresses, the line, principles, and policies determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have been continuously enriched and developed in practice. However, due to the rise of some erroneous ideas within and outside the Party in recent years, our construction and reform undertakings have been subjected to relatively serious interference and impact. After the turmoil in Beijing, the Party Central Committee proposed that the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee must not change. Therefore, we must clarify what we need to adhere to in upholding the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

I believe that adhering to the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is to continue focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and pursuing reform and opening up, which is "one center, two basic points." The core remains the vigorous development of productive forces and the construction of socialist modernization. It should be recognized that "one center, two basic points" as a whole constitute the Party's basic line. If any part is abandoned or weakened, it will deviate from the Party's line and be incomplete. In recent years, we have lacked consistency in adhering to the four cardinal principles, and even talked about them less, which is a major mistake.

Currently, we emphasize adhering to the four cardinal principles, and people discuss the relationship between the "two basic points" more, giving it more attention. Undoubtedly, this is very correct and necessary. However, there is less thought and discussion about the relationship between the "two basic points" and the "one center." In fact, while clarifying the relationship between the "two basic points," we must also understand the relationship between the "two basic points" and the "one center." If we do not do this, we may make our work go from one extreme to another. In understanding and grasping the Party's line, principles, and policies, we should strive for comprehensiveness and accuracy, avoid one-sidedness, and absolutely not "create a wind" or "bend over." We have paid a heavy price for this in the past, and we should learn from these lessons.

Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China eloquently expounded on the relationship between the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up. Then, what is the relationship between the "two basic points" and the "one center"? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that in the future, the main task is to focus on construction, and all the Party's work must serve and be subordinate to the center of economic construction. This means that the "two basic points" serve the "one center" and are the basic guarantee for implementing the "one center." Without the development of economic construction, the four cardinal principles would be like a building on sand and difficult to stabilize; reform and opening up would lose its purpose.

History and reality repeatedly tell us that the foundation for solving international and domestic problems is to develop the economy. Without strong economic strength, nothing can be accomplished. The prosperity of the state and the prosperity of the people ultimately come down to economic strength. International competition ultimately comes down to economic strength. Only when the economy develops and national strength increases can we achieve national rejuvenation and make greater contributions to humanity.

In short, with one heart and one mind, we will realize the four modernizations. This is the overriding task for the people of the entire country for a fairly long period in the future. We must not waver in our belief and determination to focus on economic construction just because a turmoil has occurred.

It should be noted that due to the mistakes in economic work in recent years, the current economic situation is severe. The prominent problem is that inflation has become more pronounced, prices have risen sharply, and the national economy is in an unstable state. The rectification and adjustment over the past year have achieved some results, but some deep-seated problems in the economy have not been solved, and some latent contradictions continue to surface. What are these deep-seated and latent contradictions? In summary, they are total imbalance, accompanied by profound structural contradictions. According to relevant analyses, the main manifestations of the current economic problems are:

(1) Social total demand far exceeds total supply. The current national strength and social production capacity of our country cannot support the huge construction scale that has been laid out and is being laid out, and the excessively high social consumption demand that has been hyped up in recent years. From 1984 to 1988, national income increased by an average of 12% per year (19.9% in current prices); the total fixed asset investment of the whole society increased by an average of 25.7% per year; the average annual increase in urban residents' monetary income was 24%. The dual inflation of investment and consumption demand is to a large extent supported by eating up old capital, running deficits, and issuing a large amount of currency. If a few years ago it could still be barely supported, it will definitely not be able to be supported in the next few years.

(2) Economic structural contradictions are prominent. The current supply capacity of agriculture, basic industries, and infrastructure in our country cannot support the excessively large industrial production scale that has already formed. Now, grain, cotton, coal, electricity, and transportation are all very tight. This reflects the serious imbalance in the proportion of industry to agriculture, processing industry to basic industry, and production to transportation.

For this unreasonable economic structure, the state has proposed clear adjustment opinions and wishes in recent years, but it is difficult to see real results in the short term. Even what should be suppressed is still expanding, and what should be strengthened is still relatively weakening; the weaker the link, the less it is strengthened; where the focus is, the greater the difficulties. Now, some important products related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and industries and undertakings related to the long-term development of the economy and society, are all in a predicament.

(3) The current production and construction framework that has been opened up is not only beyond the domestic financial and material strength to bear, but the room for maneuvering by borrowing more foreign debts and increasing imports is also small. Some Western countries, after our country's suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, imposed economic sanctions on our country, which will inevitably affect the assistance of external forces and increase economic difficulties.

(4) The above situations all lead to the deterioration of the social benefits of economic activities, and high consumption and low efficiency are the crux of the difficulties in economic life. Undoubtedly, the speed of our country's economic construction is relatively fast, but this speed is achieved through the large-scale input of manpower, financial resources, and materials, and the economic benefits are very low. That is, our national economy is in a state of high growth and low efficiency. The result is that per capita national income can only hover at a low level for a long time, making it difficult to enhance our comprehensive national power.

This low-efficiency high-speed economic growth brings only superficial prosperity. Some people call this economic form "economic hollowing out," which means that the proportion of reproducible social wealth in the current total social wealth is getting lower and lower, ultimately making it difficult for the material foundation on which society depends to support social demand, thus affecting the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

From the above situation, we can logically conclude:

- After the shift in the focus of the Party's work to economic construction, it does not mean that all problems in economic work have been solved. The problems and difficulties that appear in real economic life can only be solved in the long term through unremitting hard work under the premise of adhering to the focus on economic construction. If we abandon or weaken the policy of focusing on economic construction, it will only exacerbate difficulties and contradictions and ultimately affect stability and unity. Therefore, the policy of focusing on economic construction must not waver or change at any time or under any circumstances.

- When emphasizing the problem of "one hand hard, one hand soft," we must adopt a scientific attitude and act according to dialectics. The originally soft hand should be made hard, and the originally relatively hard hand should continue to be strengthened and cannot be made soft. The key to correctly handling the appropriate speed of economic construction and the "overheating" in economic construction is to grasp this degree. The necessary and appropriate speed in economic construction is beneficial to the long-term development of the national economy and maximizes the satisfaction of people's growing material and cultural needs. This appropriate speed is the goal we hope for and pursue. While the "overheating" in economic construction is to pursue low-efficiency high speed regardless of national strength, to blindly construct and produce regardless of the needs of the people and society. This "overheating" phenomenon must be resolutely cooled down. In a period of time, the construction of the Party and ideological and political work has been weakened, so it is very important to strengthen the construction of the Party and ideological and political work. This strengthening will promote and guide the healthy development of economic construction. However, in the leadership's thinking, we must not reduce the reasonable speed needed for economic construction because of emphasizing this point, and go from one extreme to another. Otherwise, we will make historical mistakes.

- Facing the difficulties and complex contradictions in economic work, it is not a dead end. The difficulties we face are indeed difficulties in progress, and we should not be pessimistic and helpless, doing nothing. We should have such a realization that seeing the problem is to find a way out, and encountering contradictions is to encounter a turning point. Now, as long as we rally our spirits, unite as one, take active actions, and seriously carry out rectification and adjustment and deepen reform, we can make the economic life return to a scientific and orderly track, and we can get out of the predicament and achieve a new leap.

- The long-term stability of the state, the cohesion of the Party, and the attractiveness of socialism all depend on the gradual realization of the modernization goal. Economic problems, when developed to a certain extent, will inevitably become social problems. This is a historical lesson. The enhancement of the Party's prestige and cohesion cannot be achieved through slogans, but through effective solutions to real problems, through correct leadership and effective organization of economic construction. "Poverty is not socialism," and a poor socialism cannot be sustained. If we cannot get rid of poverty, the superiority of socialism cannot be fully demonstrated, and we cannot confidently say that socialism is superior to capitalism. Therefore, we must adhere to the focus on economic construction, vigorously develop productive forces, and strive to achieve the modernization goal of socialism according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's design of the "three steps." Only in this way, no matter how big the waves are at home and abroad, our Party and country can stand unshakable.
