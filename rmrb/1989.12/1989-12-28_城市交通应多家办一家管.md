How to Quickly Change the Backward Situation - Discussion on Transportation Issues

Yantai Municipal Transportation Bureau Director Wáng Kuíyuán

From the perspective of "large traffic," a city should have only one traffic management department responsible for the unified planning, construction, and management of the entire traffic industry within its jurisdiction, thereby forming an integrated urban-rural traffic system.

In the 1960s, urban public transportation was managed by the urban construction department. Due to the strong public, social, and professional nature of the public transportation industry, which serves hundreds of thousands of passengers daily, it consumed a significant amount of the urban construction department's energy. In recent years, with the development of the commodity economy and the acceleration of urban construction, the workload of the urban construction department has increased dramatically. Transferring urban public transportation to the transportation department can not only avoid the overlap of responsibilities between departments and the inevitable conflicts that arise from this, but also allow the urban construction department to focus on urban planning and construction.

To better improve the urban public transportation order and promote the development of the public transportation industry, the Yantai Municipal Government transferred the administrative affiliation of the Yantai Municipal Public Transportation Company from the urban construction department to the transportation department starting from April 1, 1987. The transportation bureau now manages its personnel, finances, and assets, changing the previous system of multiple operators and multiple managers to a system of multiple operators and one manager.

After the transfer, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the current state and existing problems of public transportation according to the requirements of the municipal government. Utilizing the rich experience accumulated by the transportation department in long-term transportation practices, we guided the public transportation company to strengthen its basic work, train personnel, and implement modern management methods. Over the past two years, the public transportation company has seen significant changes, with an increase of 66% in operational routes, a 55.01% increase in business revenue, and the updating and renovation of 40% of old vehicles.

### 城市交通应多家办一家管

    城市交通应多家办一家管
    烟台市交通局局长　王奎元
    用“大交通”的观念看，一个城市只能有一个交通主管部门负责本辖区整个交通事业的统一规划、统一建设和统一管理，以形成城乡交通一体化。
    六十年代将城市公共交通划给城建部门管理。由于公交事业每天向成千上万的乘客提供直接的服务，群众性、社会性和专业性都很强，影响面很广，因而牵扯了城建部门巨大的精力。近年来，随着商品经济的发展、城市建设速度加快，城建部门工作量剧增，把城市公共交通划归交通部门，这样不仅可以避免部门之间职责交叉及其必然随之产生的矛盾，而且还能使城建部门集中精力搞城市规划和建设。
    为更好地改善城市公交秩序，促进公交事业发展，烟台市政府从1987年4月1日起将烟台市公共交通公司行政归属由城建部门划归交通部门，由交通局对其人、财、物统一管理，将原来城市交通多家办、多家管，变为多家办、一家管的管理体制。
    归口后，我们根据市政府的要求，对公交现状、存在的问题进行了广泛的调查，利用交通部门长期运输实践中积累的丰富经验，指导公交公司加强基础工作，培训人才，推行现代化管理方法。归口两年来，公交公司发生了明显的变化，营运线路增加了66％，营业收入增加了55.01％，并对40％的老旧车辆进行了更新改造。
