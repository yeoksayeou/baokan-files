Liu Huaqing and other old Red Army soldiers who once fought in a certain Red Army unit in the Beijing Military Region, including Program Zihua, Guo Shushen, Liu Zhen, Wang Chenghan, Zhang Chiming, and Chen Xianrui, visited the unit today to speak about traditions and encourage the officers and soldiers to carry forward the revolutionary traditions and make new contributions to building a modern, regular revolutionary army.

Upon entering the camp, they heard the spirited and melodious team song and saw the vigorous new generation, which made these old Red Army soldiers particularly happy. They stood before the battle flags soaked in blood and gunpowder, recalling the unit's 57-year-long battle journey and recounting the unit's glorious achievements during the revolutionary war years.

Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing earnestly encouraged everyone to carry forward the great revolutionary traditions in the new historical period, resolutely follow the Party's leadership, listen to the Party's commands, firmly uphold the political direction of striving for socialism and communism, strengthen unity among officers and soldiers, maintain close relations with the people, work hard, adhere to discipline, and achieve greater success in the construction of a revolutionary, modern, and regular army. He also emphasized the need to complete the sacred mission of defending against foreign imperialist aggression, safeguarding people's democratic dictatorship, and protecting the Four Modernizations.

    一走进营区，听到昂扬嘹亮的团歌声，看到生龙活虎的新一代，这些老红军格外高兴。他们在一面面浸染着鲜血和硝烟的战旗前，向干部战士回忆起这个团57年来所走过的战斗历程，讲述团队在革命战争年代的光辉业绩。
    中央军委副主席刘华清语重心长地勉励大家，在新的历史时期，一定要发扬光大革命传统，坚决服从党的领导，听从党的指挥，坚定为社会主义、共产主义奋斗的政治方向，加强官兵团结，密切军民关系，艰苦奋斗，严守纪律，在革命化现代化正规化建设中取得更大成绩，完成好对外抵御帝国主义侵略、对内保卫人民民主专政、保卫四化建设的神圣使命。
