		PRAGUE, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, Marsik, said on Nov. 30 that Czechoslovakia was surprised and concerned by the 10-point plan proposed by West German Chancellor Kohl on Nov. 28 for the political reunification of Germany.

		The spokesman pointed out that the stability and security of Europe are closely related to the vital interests of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia will not remain indifferent to any steps that may cast doubt on the postwar European status quo and undermine efforts to strengthen European security and cooperation.
