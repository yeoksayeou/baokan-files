President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines today called on the people to support the government and provide any information they have about the recent failed military coup plotters.

In her weekly "Talk to the People" radio program, she urged the people to unite against the enemies of democracy. Regarding the leaders of the failed coup, she stated: They will face legal punishment. She also called on the soldiers who were deceived by the mutinous officers to return to the government's fold and not bring further harm to themselves.

Reports indicate that some of the rebel leaders have gone into hiding. A rebel spokesman today threatened that once they gather enough strength, they will launch another coup aimed at overthrowing the Aquino government.

According to reports, Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff Renato de Villa ordered all regional commanders to strengthen unity to thwart the activities of rebel leaders aimed at disrupting the restoration of normal order in the country and to prevent a recurrence of the mutiny.
