When I met him in the Ulan Buh Desert, he had already spent 18 years in the desert. Over 18 years, this "little Beijing" had become a genuine northwestern man.

He is He Weiping, a representative of the national model soldier, a first-class meritorious soldier, a recipient of the Silver Medal for Outstanding Border Guard, and the deputy director of logistics for a certain border defense unit.

In the early 1970s, He Weiping, then a teenager, enlisted from Beijing and came to a certain border defense regiment stationed in the Badain Jaran Desert. His long-awaited military life began, but the first taste was bitter. Facing the harsh living conditions, he had a few moments of wavering, but seeing the glory and responsibility of the border guards, he understood that the value of a soldier lies in selfless dedication and courage in sacrifice. Thus, he made a vow: "I am willing to be a green leaf in the desert."

He Weiping went from being a cook to a quartermaster, then to a political instructor, with increasingly heavy responsibilities. Facing the situation where soldiers could not eat fresh vegetables for years, many of them lost hair, had brittle nails, suffered from skin diseases, and night blindness, he used his opportunity to return to Beijing on leave to learn from masters in the suburbs, mastering the cultivation methods of more than ten types of vegetables. Upon his return, he and the soldiers carried stones and filled pits, leveling 3 mu of land in the Gobi desert, planting seven or eight types of vegetables, and digging two wells over ten meters deep. That year, they produced several thousand pounds of vegetables.

The border defense unit has heavy patrol duties. In summer, the temperature can reach over 40 degrees Celsius, and in winter, it often drops to minus 40 degrees Celsius. Under such harsh conditions, He Weiping always volunteered to lead the patrols.

In the early 1980s, He Weiping returned to Beijing, which he had not seen for three years, with a mix of longing and homesickness for his family. At the train station, his wife, Hu Aiqing, found him and told their son, "This is your father," but Xiao Xiao, who had not seen his father at the age of four, did not call him "Dad"! At that moment, this tough man hugged his son and cried.

Yes, he owed so much to his wife and child.

"Weiping, you've been at the border for a long time. It's time to come back and take care of the family. I really can't hold on anymore." He Weiping listened to his wife's words, his heart churning: At the border, there are so many "old border guards" who forget their families and dedicate themselves to defending the country. How could I, a Beijing native and a cadre's child, ask the organization to transfer me?

When he returned to the unit, He Weiping specially brought his wife to the outpost. The officers and soldiers of the company welcomed her like their own family, greeting her several miles away on the sand dunes and escorting her into the outpost.

When it was time to leave, the soldiers sent her off again and again, with endless words and unbreakable bonds. This woman, who had grown up in the city, said to her husband with tears in her eyes as they parted: "You should do well here..."

He Weiping spent 13 years in the border defense unit. In 1985, the organization recommended him to study at the Wuhan Military Logistics Academy. After two years of study, some people urged him to use this opportunity to return to Beijing. However, he resolutely returned to the most difficult border defense regiment in the Inner Mongolia Military Region to serve as the deputy director of logistics.

At the border, He Weiping shared hardships with the officers and soldiers, always leading the way and taking the initiative. Over nearly 20 years, He Weiping poured his youthful love into the vast desert, leaving a series of firm footprints.

    魂系大漠
    ——记全军英模代表、一等功臣何卫平
    包国俊
    当我在乌兰布和沙漠见到他时，他已在大漠里整整滚了18年了。18年来，这个“小北京”变成了地道的西北汉子。
    他，就是全军英模代表、一等功臣、边陲优秀儿女银质奖章获得者、边防某团后勤处长何卫平。
    70年代初，十几岁的何卫平，从北京入伍来到了驻守在巴丹吉林沙漠中的某边防团一连。梦寐以求的军旅生活开始了，可尝到的第一口就是苦味。面对艰苦的生活环境，他思想上也曾产生过几次波动，可从那些“老边防”的身上看到了边防战士的光荣职责；懂得了军人的价值在于忘我战斗，勇于牺牲。于是，他立下誓言：“愿做大漠一片绿叶。”
    何卫平从炊事员到司务长、指导员，肩上的担子越来越重。面对指战员们长年吃不到新鲜蔬菜，不少人落头发、翘指甲、患有皮炎、夜盲症等疾病的现状，他利用回京休假的机会，到郊区拜师学艺，学会了十几类菜的种植方法。回队后，他和战士们一道抬石头、填沙坑，硬是在戈壁滩上平整了3亩菜地，种了七八种菜，又挖了两口十多米深的苦水井，当年产菜几千斤。
    边防连队巡逻任务重，夏天气温高达40多摄氏度，冬天气温常降到零下40多摄氏度。在这样恶劣条件下，何卫平每次巡逻都争着带队。
    80年代初，何卫平带着对亲人的眷恋和思念，回到了阔别3年的北京。在火车站的人流中，妻子胡爱琴找到了他并告诉儿子：“这是你爸爸”时，到四岁还未见过父亲的萧萧怎么也不叫一声：“爸爸”！此刻，这个硬汉子抱着儿子哭了。
    是呵，他对妻子、对孩子欠得太多了。
    “卫平，你在边防时间不短了，该回来顾顾这个家了，我实在支撑不了。”何卫平听着妻子的诉说，心里翻腾着：在边防，有那么多“老边防”，舍家忘我，卫国戍边，我怎么能因为是北京人、干部子弟就向组织提出转业呢？
    归队时，何卫平特意把妻子带到哨所。连里的干部、战士像迎接自己的亲人一样，在几里之外的沙梁上把她迎进了哨所。
    临走时，战士们送了一程又一程，真是叙不尽的话语，扯不断的情丝。这个从小生长在都市的女性同丈夫分手时感动地说：“你在这好好干就是啦……”
    何卫平在边防一连一干就是13年。1985年，组织上推荐他到武汉军事后勤学院学习。两年学业期满，一些人动员他借此机会回北京。可他毅然回到内蒙古军区条件最苦的边防团任后勤处长。
    在边防，何卫平和指战员同甘共苦，处处走在前，干在先。近20年，何卫平把青春的爱洒向广袤的大漠，留下了一串串坚实的脚印……
