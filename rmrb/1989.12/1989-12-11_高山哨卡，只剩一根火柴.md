On June 3 of this year, a fierce wind blew away the 20-square-meter tin-roofed shack at the Zho La outpost on the Sino-Nepal border in the southern foothills of the Himalayas, sending it tumbling into a deep valley. A torrential downpour mixed with heavy snow followed, "ravaging" the makeshift open-air dormitory. Even worse, a pile of cement bricks falling from the wall just happened to land on 12 boxes of matches, breaking the plastic bag that contained them. The rain-soaked matches froze into hard ice blocks.

Without a fire, the outpost would be plunged into darkness, cold, and hunger. The cook, Zhao Gang, was so anxious that he burst into tears.

After a thorough search, a single matchstick was finally found in a small wooden box that once belonged to an "old smoker."

The soldiers gathered around in excitement, and Zhao Gang quickly tore off a piece of matchstick paper from the ice block and warmed it under his armpit.

Wang, the platoon leader, solemnly announced to the entire platoon, "Now we have only one matchstick. If it fails to light, what will happen to the outpost? Everyone understands. Who can guarantee it will light?"

Indeed, at an altitude of over 4,800 meters on this border mountain, the oxygen content in the air is only about 50% of that in the plains, and the lowest temperature can drop to minus 30-40 degrees Celsius. Due to the high altitude and cold, it is common to fail to light a matchstick even after trying half a box just to cook or light a candle.

But now, there is only one matchstick!

"I'll try to light it!" the stubborn and competitive new soldier, Xiao Wang, stood up abruptly. Everyone's gaze turned to him, as if seeing a glimmer of hope in him. Wang, the platoon leader, nodded in agreement.

Xiao Wang began to tremble with tension. He rolled up his sleeves, picked up the "heavy" matchstick.

"Scratch"—it was too light, and it didn't catch. Xiao Wang's hand was a bit unsteady. Another "scratch" sound, a spark appeared at the matchstick head, followed by a wisp of smoke that disappeared into the black night with the cold wind.

The fire was gone. Deputy platoon leader Chen Dewu couldn't help but pinch Xiao Wang's arm, then hugged him and burst into tears.

The cold and fatigue hit them all at once. The soldiers huddled together, eating compressed rations and taking turns standing guard.

The next day, the sun rose from behind the snow-capped peaks. Deputy platoon leader Chen Dewu volunteered to go down the mountain to the town of Yadong, 50 kilometers away, to buy matches. This narrow path had 13 kilometers covered in ice and snow, with some sections having snow up to 1.3 meters deep. The rest of the path was a mess of rocks, thorns, and bushes. The slope was steep, the road was slippery, and the terrain was rough. Chen Dewu set out at 9:40 AM and didn't reach the Yadong team's guesthouse until 11:35 PM.

The next dawn, Chen Dewu knocked on the door of the general store in the guesthouse, bought 50 boxes of matches, carefully wrapped them in a plastic bag, and also bought some daily necessities for his comrades. He then went to the team's mailroom to pick up a large bundle of letters and newspapers that had not been collected from the outpost for half a year. At 8:30 AM, he set out on the return journey to the outpost with over 20 pounds of supplies. The elevation difference from Yadong town to the outpost is 2,000 meters. Every step taken from a lower altitude to a higher altitude requires immense effort. Chen Dewu ate compressed rations when hungry and ate snow when thirsty. When he reached 2.5 kilometers from the outpost, the snow was thicker, and the slope was steeper. Exhausted, he felt chest tightness, dizziness, and shortness of breath. The outpost's comrades were worried about Chen Dewu. At 11:55 PM, Wang, the platoon leader, led two soldiers down the mountain to meet him. Chen Dewu saw his comrades coming to meet him, took a step forward, and collapsed in the snow.

The matches brought light, warmth, and hot food to the outpost, as well as joy and vitality. By the stove, a soldier played the guitar, and the entire platoon sang their self-composed outpost song in a rough and powerful voice:

"I Love You, Zho La"

Zho La is my home, no matter how hard or tired, I love her;
Hard work and dedication, determined to protect the country...

     高山哨卡，只剩一根火柴
     胡华
    今年6月3日，一股狂风将喜玛拉雅山南麓中（国）锡（金）边境卓拉哨卡那20多平方米的铁皮房盖掀到了深山沟里。大雨夹着暴雪袭来，“露天宿舍”遭到了“洗劫”。更糟糕的是，从墙上掉下来的一堆水泥砖恰好砸在12盒火柴上，包火柴的塑料袋被砸破。雨雪浸透的火柴，结成了坚硬的冰块。
    没有火种，哨卡将是黑暗，将是寒冷，将没饭吃。炊事员卓刚急得直掉眼泪。
    经过分头搜索，终于从以前一位“老烟哥”的小木箱里找出一根不知何时残存的火柴。
    战士们欣喜地围了上来，卓刚赶忙从冰块上撕下一片磷纸放在腋下暖干。
    王班长向全班郑重宣布：“现在只有一根火柴，如果划不燃，将会给哨卡带来什么？大家都很明白。谁能保证划燃？”
    是啊，在这海拔4800多米的边境高山上，空气中含氧量仅有内地的50％左右，最低气温达零下30—40摄氏度。因高寒缺氧，平时生火烧饭或点蜡烛，划了半盒也划不燃一根火柴的“记录”经常保持。
    而今，仅有一根火柴啊！
    “我来划，争取划燃！”平时性格倔犟，争强好胜的新战士小王“霍”地站了起来。大家的目光一齐投向他，似乎在他身上看到了“希望之火”。王班长也信任地点了点头。
    小王紧张得颤抖起来。他捋了捋袖口，拿起了这根“沉重”的火柴。
      “嘶”——太轻，没划燃。小王的手有点不听使唤。又是“嘶”地一声，火柴头出现了红火星，随即是一缕青烟随着寒风飘去，燃了一下的火星消逝在漆黑的夜里。
    火种没有了。副班长陈德会忍不住拧了一下小王的胳膊，随后又抱住小王放声哭开了。
    寒冷和疲劳一起袭来。战士们一边啃着压缩干粮，一边背靠着背互暖身体，轮流上岗放哨。
    翌日，太阳从雪峰上升起，副班长陈德会自告奋勇下山到50公里外的亚东县城购买火柴。这条羊肠小道，有13公里被冰雪覆盖，有的路段积雪厚达1.3米，其余的路段都是乱石堆、荆棘丛、灌木林。坡陡路滑，坎坷泥泞。陈副班长从早上9点40分出发，直到深夜11点35分才到达亚东团部招待所。
    第二天拂晓，陈副班长叩开招待所百货商店的门，购买了50盒火柴，还买了个塑料袋精心包好，又帮战友们买了些日用小百货，再去团部收发室取了一大捆哨卡半年多没取的信件报纸。上午8时30分，他背着20多斤重的物品，踏上了返回哨卡的征途。亚东县城到哨卡高差2000米。从低海拔往高海拔行走，每迈一步都要付出极大的代价。陈副班长在途中饿了啃干粮，渴了吃冰雪。走到离哨卡2.5公里的地方，雪更厚，坡度增大，精疲力竭的他已感胸闷头昏，气喘吁吁。哨卡战友们的心系着副班长。深夜11点55分，王班长带着两个战士摸黑下山去接应。陈副班长见战友来接，往前窜了一下就倒在了雪地里。
    火柴为哨卡带来了光明，温暖和热饭，也带来了欢乐和生气。在火炉旁，一位战士弹着吉它，全班战友用粗犷宏亮的声音唱起了自己创作的哨卡之歌——
      《我爱你——卓拉》：
    卓拉就是我的家，再苦再累也爱她；
    艰苦创业乐奉献，志在天涯保国家……
