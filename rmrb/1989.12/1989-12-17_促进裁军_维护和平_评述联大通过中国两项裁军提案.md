The 44th UN General Assembly unanimously adopted two important proposals submitted by our country on nuclear and conventional disarmament. These are two of the most sensitive proposals in the political realm concerning world peace, and they have been passed by the UN General Assembly for the fourth consecutive time. Based on our country's consistent policy of opposing arms races and maintaining world peace, these two resolutions, which were proposed with a positive and practical spirit, reflect the consensus of countries around the world on the fundamental direction and tasks of the current situation and the struggle for disarmament. Therefore, they have received widespread support from the international community.

China's proposals highlight the special responsibility of the United States and the Soviet Union, the two superpowers, in stopping the arms race and achieving disarmament, which is based on the reality of the global arms race. In recent years, the military confrontation between the East and the West has relatively weakened, and the international situation has tended to ease, with some progress made in the field of disarmament. The main achievement is the agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union to completely eliminate their intermediate-range and short-range missiles, which is now being implemented. However, for the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess the world's largest nuclear and conventional arsenals, this is far from enough. Although both sides say they need to continue disarmament, they still want to "preserve themselves and weaken the other side" in negotiations, so the disarmament talks have not progressed quickly. The two countries' leaders declared after their meeting earlier this month that they would strive to sign a treaty on strategic nuclear weapons reductions next year, but whether this will be realized on schedule remains to be seen. The 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact countries began negotiations on conventional disarmament in Europe in March this year, which have just started and have not yet reached an agreement.

Currently, the nuclear weapons possessed by the United States and the Soviet Union still account for 95% of the world's nuclear arsenal. Among them, the two countries each possess more than 10,000 strategic nuclear warheads. Even if the United States and the Soviet Union each reduce their arsenals by 50%, they will still each possess approximately 6,000 warheads. Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union's advanced strategic nuclear forces, consisting of intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range air-launched and submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers, are continuously being improved, and they are also competing to develop space-based weapons, posing a serious threat to world peace and security. Conventional armaments are also a major area of the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Especially in Europe, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their two major military blocs have concentrated the most massive conventional military forces. According to the statistics published by NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the two blocs have a total of: 5,180,000 troops, 81,694 tanks, 117,969 armored vehicles, 88,888 artillery pieces, 12,446 combat aircraft, and 5,384 combat helicopters. Such a dense concentration of weapons, if a conflict were to break out, and especially if it escalated into a nuclear war, would inevitably bring great disaster to the peoples of Europe and the world.

In the Chinese resolution, it is proposed that "while solving the quantitative aspects of the arms race, the qualitative aspects must also be addressed." This expresses the international community's serious concern and vigilance towards the dangerous trend of the arms race. The nuclear and conventional weapons of the United States and the Soviet Union are both "oversaturated," with a considerable portion already outdated and in need of replacement. While they are preparing to reduce the quantity of their armaments, they are also using new scientific inventions to improve and manufacture new types of weapons, including nuclear and conventional weapons, posing an increasingly serious threat to human survival.

Due to the joint efforts of countries around the world, some progress has been made in the field of international disarmament, but the goals of nuclear and conventional disarmament are far from being achieved. This directly relates to world peace and the security of all countries. Regardless of size or strength, all countries have the right to participate in the discussion and resolution of disarmament issues on an equal basis. Only through the continued joint efforts of all countries can the disarmament process be promoted to move forward.

### 促进裁军  维护和平——评述联大通过中国两项裁军提案

    促进裁军  维护和平
    ——评述联大通过中国两项裁军提案
    本报记者　刘开宸
    第44届联大今天又一致通过了我国提出的关于核裁军和常规裁军两项重要提案。这是有关世界和平、在政治领域里最敏感的两项提案，连续第四次在联大通过。根据我国反对军备竞赛、维护世界和平的一贯政策，以积极求实精神提出的这两项决议案，体现了世界各国对当前形势和裁军斗争的根本方向和任务问题上的共识，所以受到国际社会的普遍支持。
    中国提案突出了美苏两个超级大国对停止军备竞赛和裁军的特殊责任，是从世界军备竞赛的现实出发的。几年来，东西方军事对峙相对减弱，国际局势趋向缓和，裁军领域取得了一些进展，主要是美苏就全部销毁两国的中程和中短程导弹签署了协议，并开始实施。但是，这对拥有世界上最大核武库和常规武库的美苏来说，还远远不够。它们虽然都说需要继续裁军，却又要在谈判中“保存自己，削弱对方”，因而裁军谈判进展不快。两国首脑在本月初会谈后宣称要争取在明年就削减战略核武器问题签署条约，是否如期实现，有待观察。北约和华约23国今年3月开始欧洲常规裁军谈判，更是刚刚起步，也尚未达成协议。
    现在，美苏拥有的核武器，仍占全世界核武库的95％，其中，两国拥有的进攻性战略武器核弹头，都超过了1万枚，即使美苏两国各自裁减50％后，仍各拥有大约6000枚。不仅如此，美国和苏联的洲际弹道导弹、远程空射和潜射导弹和战略轰炸机三位一体的先进的战略核力量仍在不断改进，而且竞相发展外空武器，严重威胁世界和平与安全。常规军备也是美苏军备竞赛的主要领域。特别在欧洲，美苏及其两大军事集团集中了最庞大的常规军事力量。根据北约、华约各自公布的数字统计，两大集团共有：军队518万人，坦克81694辆，装甲车117969辆，大炮88888门，作战飞机12446架，作战直升机5384架。如此密集的武器装备，一旦战事爆发，而且还有可能升级为核战争，势必会给欧洲和世界各国人民带来极大的灾难。
    中国决议案中，提出“在解决军备竞赛数量方面问题的同时，也要解决其质量方面的问题”，这表达了国际社会对军备竞赛危险趋势的严重关切和警惕。美苏的核武器和常规武器数量都“超饱和”，相当部分已过时，要更换。它们在准备裁减军备数量的同时，却在利用新的科学发明，改进并制造新型的武器，包括核武器和常规武器，对人类生存形成日益严重的威胁。
    由于世界各国的共同努力，国际裁军领域总算取得了一些进展，但核裁军与常规裁军的目标远未实现。这直接关系到世界和平与各国安全。国家无论大小，不分强弱，都有权在平等的基础上参与裁军问题的讨论和解决。只有各国继续共同努力，才有可能推动裁军进程向前发展。　　（本报联合国12月15日电）
