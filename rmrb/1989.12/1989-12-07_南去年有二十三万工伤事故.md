Yugoslavia recorded more than 230,000 work-related accidents in 1988, resulting in 431 deaths. The various losses caused by work-related injuries and occupational diseases amounted to 20 billion dollars, accounting for 4% to 5% of the national income.

This was announced at a recent meeting of the Yugoslav Trade Union Federation's Executive Committee, which discussed labor protection issues.

The meeting pointed out that the main causes of work-related accidents include: failure to comply with labor protection regulations, inadequate recognition of the dangers and harmfulness of certain jobs, outdated production equipment, lack of labor protection facilities, insufficient worker training, and poor labor discipline.

    南去年有二十三万工伤事故
    南斯拉夫一九八八年共发生二十三万多起工伤事故，造成四百三十一人死亡。因工伤和职业病造成的各种损失达二十亿美元，占全国国民收入的百分之四至百分之五。
    这是南工会联合会理事会最近开会讨论劳动保护问题时公布的。
    会议指出，造成工伤事故的主要原因有：不遵守劳动保护规定，对有些工作的危险性和有害性认识不足，生产设备陈旧，缺乏劳动保护设施，对工人培训不够以及劳动纪律不严等。
