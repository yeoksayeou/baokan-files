Dongliao County Truly Serves Farmers
No Silent Losses, No Empty Promises

Early this year, Li Yunbiao, the county magistrate of Dongliao County, Jilin Province, discovered through an investigation that the county's linked chemical fertilizers were supplied to farmers at a comprehensive price each spring, and the difference between the comprehensive price and the state-subsidized price, along with the interest from the farmers' demand deposits, was refunded to the farmers in the autumn. This method of supplying fertilizers essentially forced all the farmers in the county to pay tens of millions of yuan in commercial loan interest. To solve this problem of unreasonable burden, Li Yunbiao convened several meetings with relevant departments and improved the pricing and collection methods for the linked fertilizers supplied this year: he calculated the quantity of linked fertilizers for each village and household and collected payments at the state-regulated price. For those who purchased excess amounts, the comprehensive price was applied. By doing so, farmers saved over 400,000 yuan in interest annually. At the same time, it also reduced loans by over 40 million yuan.

Due to the state's tight monetary policy, many farmers, despite having completed loan procedures during the spring plowing season, were unable to obtain cash. However, the bank started calculating interest from the date the loan procedures were completed. This not only affected production but also increased the farmers' unreasonable burden. To address this, the county took various measures to ensure that farmers could purchase agricultural supplies, thus solving the difficulties faced by both the bank and the farmers.

After implementing these measures, Dongliao County reduced the farmers' unreasonable burden by 10 million yuan.

    东辽县为农民办事实在
    不让吃哑巴亏  不开空头支票
    今年初，吉林东辽县县长李云彪调查发现，本县的挂钩化肥，按每年春天的综合价供应给农民，秋后再把平价与综合价的差价款连同它的活期存款利息一道返还给农民。这种供应化肥的方法，无异迫使全县农民多支付几十万元的商业贷款利息。为解决这一不合理负担问题，李云彪同志几次召集有关部门研究，并在今年供应挂钩化肥时改进了计价收款的办法：逐村逐户统计出挂钩肥的数量，按国家规定价格收款。超量购买者，按综合价收款。这样做，农民一年可少支付利息40多万元。同时也减少贷款400多万元。
    由于国家紧缩银根，春耕期间很多农民办了贷款手续，却拿不到现金，而银行则从办理贷款手续之日起开始计息。这样，既影响生产，又加重了农民不合理的负担。为此，县里想方设法使农民买到农用物资，解决了银行和农民双方的困难。
    东辽县采取一些措施后，减少全县农民不合理负担100万元。
