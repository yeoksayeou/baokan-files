Hong Kong police arrested a suspect in the world's largest drug case at Kai Tak Airport last night.

The suspect is a 34-year-old Hong Kong resident who is believed to be the leader of an international drug trafficking organization. He is one of the top 10 most wanted criminals. On November 16, police in Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United States conducted a joint operation, dismantling this organization and arresting 11 men and women in the United States and Hong Kong. Police believe that over the past two years, this international drug trafficking organization has transported more than two tons of drugs from the "Golden Triangle" opium-producing region in Thailand to the United States, with a total value of 13.26 billion Hong Kong dollars, making it the largest drug case in the world to date.

The arrested man will be brought to court in Hong Kong for a hearing on extradition and then transferred to the United States for trial.
