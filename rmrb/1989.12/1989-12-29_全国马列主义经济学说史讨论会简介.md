The second academic symposium of the National Marxist-Leninist Economic Thought History Society was held in mid-November 1989 in Guangzhou. Representatives discussed how to uphold and develop Marxism-Leninism, the guiding role of Marxism in contemporary communist movements and socialist practices, and contemporary imperialist theories and real-world issues.

Upholding and developing Marxism was the main topic of this symposium. Representatives agreed that upholding and developing Marxism must be based on a complete and accurate understanding and grasp of the basic principles of Marxist economics. They emphasized that in studying the history of Marxist economic thought, it is essential to adhere to and promote a scholarly attitude of seeking truth from facts and rigorous study. One should not inject one's own partial understanding into the interpretation of Marxism. Only in this way can the study of the history of Marxist economic thought develop in the correct direction.

Representatives discussed the relationship between upholding and developing Marxism. Some comrades suggested that Marxism must be developed on the basis of upholding it, with upholding being the primary concern. Upholding mainly refers to upholding the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. Only in this way can the study of Marxism always develop on the correct track. Others emphasized the dialectical unity of upholding and developing, proposing that one should develop while upholding and uphold while developing. Representatives unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strengthen the study of the basic principles of Marxist economics, which is the fundamental aspect of upholding and developing Marxism. Only by thoroughly understanding the basic theory of Marxism can one establish a complete and scientific theoretical history system and correctly guide the construction and development of applied disciplines.

The scope of research in the history of Marxist economic thought was another important issue of concern to the representatives. Many comrades believed that the scope of research should include Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and all theoretical doctrines that analyze problems from a Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. In addition to the classic Marxist-Leninist authors, researchers who adhere to Marxism should also be included. Some people's political attitudes and academic views may have changed over time, such as the theoretical views of Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, Rudolf Hilferding, Eduard Bernstein, and Nikolai Bukharin, which need to be analyzed concretely. One should not simply adopt an attitude of complete negation or complete affirmation but should make a serious evaluation based on the historical conditions of the time. Many comrades pointed out that one should broaden one's horizons and expand the scope of research, comparing and analyzing different schools and views within Western Marxist economics to draw scientific conclusions. Representatives especially emphasized that the study of the history of Marxist economic thought should pay attention to the new situations arising in contemporary communist movements and socialist country reforms, using the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze and understand these issues. Representatives unanimously agreed that Marxist economics itself is very rich in content and is a scientific system that is constantly developing and adding new content in practice. This requires theoretical workers to be bold in exploration and to seriously summarize historical experience to guide practice.

The origin and development of socialist economic thought is an important part of the study of the history of Marxist economic thought and was a topic of concern at the symposium. Representatives first discussed the research methods of the history of socialist economic thought. Some comrades advocated for a longitudinal study of the history of socialist economic thought, which has the advantage of combining the era background, historical environment, and conditions to compare different views from different periods, aiding in the in-depth study of specific issues. Others believed that longitudinal studies can easily lead to a one-sided and incomplete understanding of economic concepts, severing the intrinsic connections between different economic categories and failing to form a complete theoretical system. Therefore, they advocated for a horizontal study of the history of socialist economic thought, analyzing and comparing theoretical views and issues that appeared in the same period in different countries, and revealing the laws from them. Some comrades proposed that longitudinal and horizontal studies each have their characteristics and neither should be neglected. Socialist economics is a large organic system, so it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study that combines both longitudinal and horizontal approaches to draw complete conclusions. All representatives agreed that regardless of the specific research method adopted, one must adhere to the basic principle of historical materialism, which unifies Marxist logic and history.

Representatives also expressed different opinions on the specific periodization of the development of socialist economic theory.

The first view divides the development of socialist economic theory from its inception to the present into four stages: the first stage from the 1840s to the October Revolution, during which the classic authors made scientific predictions and analyses of future society; the second stage from the October Revolution to the late 1920s, during which socialist economic theory was in an exploratory stage and had not yet formed a complete theoretical system. The third stage from the late 1920s to the 1950s, represented by Stalin, formed and established a relatively systematic economic theory that dominated and had a significant impact on socialist practice; the fourth stage from the 1950s to the present, during which theoretical research has entered a new stage of development in response to new issues arising in socialist economic development. Some comrades divided the development of socialist economic theory into the stages of proposing the theory (1840 to the October Revolution), practicing it in one country (October Revolution to World War II), practicing it in multiple countries (World War II to 1979), and the stage of reforming and perfecting the theory (1979 to the present).

The second view advocates for dividing the development of socialist economic theory into three stages: (1) the transition of socialist theory from utopian to scientific, with the highest achievement being the basic principles provided by Marx and Engels for future society; (2) the transition of socialist theory into the stage of practice, during which many theoretical models were formed, including China's theory of the primary stage of socialism; (3) the stage of further development of socialist economic theory in practice, during which the theory focuses on both the relationship between the socialist mode of production and economic development and the characteristics of the socialist economic structure and economic operation mechanism. Some comrades proposed the stages of creation (from utopian socialism to the late 19th century), development (late 19th century to early 20th century), and practice (early 20th century to the present), and believed that each stage can be further divided into smaller stages.

Representatives also discussed and studied the issue of imperialism and the theory of monopoly capitalism.

    全国马列主义经济学说史讨论会简介
    全国马克思列宁主义经济学说史学会第二届学术讨论会于1989年11月中旬在广州举行。代表们就如何坚持和发展马克思列宁主义，马克思主义对当代共产主义运动和社会主义实践的指导作用，以及当代帝国主义理论和现实问题进行了热烈的讨论。
    如何坚持和发展马克思主义是本届讨论会的主要论题。与会代表认为，坚持和发展马克思主义必须建立在完整、准确地理解和把握马克思主义经济学基本原理的基础之上。一致认为，在马克思主义经济学说史的研究中一定要贯彻和发扬实事求是、刻苦严谨的学风，不能把自己的片面理解注入对马克思主义的解释之中。只有这样，才能保证马克思主义经济学说史的研究沿着正确的方向发展。
    代表们讨论了坚持马克思主义和发展马克思主义的关系问题。部分同志提出，必须在坚持的基础上发展马克思主义，坚持是第一位的，而坚持主要是指坚持马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，也只有如此，才能保证马克思主义研究始终沿着正确的轨道发展。有的同志则强调坚持与发展的辩证统一关系，提出应该在坚持中发展，在发展中坚持。代表们一致认为，一定要加强对马克思主义经济学基本原理的研究，这也是坚持和发展马克思主义的根本所在。只有真正弄通马克思主义基本理论，才能建立完整科学的理论史学体系，才能正确指导应用学科的建设和发展。
    马克思主义经济学说史的研究范围是代表们关注的另一个重要问题。许多同志认为，马克思主义经济学说史的研究范围应该包括：马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想及所有以马克思主义立场、观点和方法分析问题的理论学说。研究的人物除马列经典作家外，还应包括所有坚持马克思主义的研究者。有些人的政治态度前后可能有所变化，学术观点也不尽相同，诸如对卢森堡、考茨基、希法亭、伯恩施坦、布哈林等人的理论观点就要做具体分析，对此，不能简单地采取全盘否定或全盘肯定的态度，要根据当时的历史条件做认真的鉴别。许多同志指出，应开阔视野，拓宽研究领域，对西方马克思主义经济学中的不同流派和观点进行比较分析，得出科学的结论。代表们特别强调马克思主义经济学说史的研究要注意联系当代共产主义运动和社会主义国家改革中出现的新情况，用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法分析认识这些问题。代表们一致认为，马克思主义经济学本身内容十分丰富，同时又是一个不断发展、不断在实践中增添新内容的科学体系，这就要求理论工作者勇于探索，认真总结历史经验以指导实践。
    社会主义经济思想的产生和发展是马克思主义经济学说史研究的重要组成部分，也是会上大家所关注的论题。代表们首先就社会主义经济学说史的研究方法展开了讨论。有的同志主张从纵向上对社会主义经济学说史进行专题研究，其优点在于可以结合时代背景、历史环境和条件，比较不同时期的不同观点，有助于深入研究专门问题。有的同志则认为，纵向专题研究容易形成片面的、不完整的经济概念，割裂各经济范畴之间的内在联系，无法形成完整的理论体系。因此，他们主张从总体上对社会主义经济学说史进行横向研究，分析和比较同一时期、不同国家出现的理论观点和问题，并从中揭示出规律。还有的同志提出，纵向横向研究各有特点，二者不可偏废。社会主义经济是一个大的有机系统，因此，要进行纵横结合的全面研究，得出完整的结论。与会代表一致认为，无论采取什么样的具体研究方法，都要遵循马克思主义逻辑与历史相统一的历史唯物主义基本原则。
    代表们还就社会主义经济理论发展的具体分期问题发表了不同的意见。
    第一种观点把社会主义经济理论从产生到目前的发展划分为四个阶段：第一阶段从19世纪40年代至苏联十月革命，这是经典作家对未来社会进行理论上的科学预测和分析的阶段；第二阶段从苏联十月革命至本世纪20年代末，这一阶段，社会主义经济理论处于探索阶段，还未形成完整的理论体系。第三阶段从本世纪20年代末至50年代，以斯大林为代表，形成和确立了较为系统的经济理论并处于支配地位，对社会主义实践影响较大；第四阶段从本世纪50年代至今，对社会主义经济发展中出现的新问题，理论研究进入了一个新的发展阶段。还有的同志把社会主义经济理论的发展划分为提出理论（1840年至十月革命）、在一国进行实践（十月革命至二次大战）、在多国付诸实践（二次大战至1979年）和改革与完善理论阶段（1979年至今）。
    第二种观点主张划分为三个阶段：（1）社会主义理论从空想到科学阶段，最高成果是马恩为未来社会提供了基本原则；（2）社会主义理论转入实践阶段，这一阶段形成了许多理论模式，我国提出社会主义初级阶段理论；（3）社会主义经济理论在实践中进一步发展的阶段，这一阶段的理论呈现出既侧重于研究社会主义生产方式与经济发展的关系，又研究社会主义经济结构与经济运行机制的特点。也有同志提出创立阶段（从空想社会主义至19世纪末）、发展阶段（19世纪末至20世纪初）和实践阶段（20世纪初至今）等三个阶段，并认为在每一阶段中还可划分出更小的阶段。
    与会代表还就帝国主义问题和垄断资本主义理论进行了讨论和研究。
