Chinese President Yang Shangkun praised the continuous development of Sino-Egyptian friendship during a banquet held in his honor by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. He emphasized that China would steadfastly implement the policy of reform and opening up, continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, and develop friendly cooperative relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Strengthening and developing friendly relations with Third World countries is an important pillar of China's foreign policy.

His remarks were made at a banquet hosted by President Mubarak.

As night fell, the Egyptian presidential palace was brightly lit, with the orchestra playing melodious tunes, creating a warm atmosphere of Sino-Egyptian friendship. President Mubarak welcomed Chinese President Yang Shangkun at the entrance hall. The two leaders had a friendly chat in the lounge before shaking hands with senior government officials from both countries attending the banquet and entering the banquet hall.

The banquet began with the national anthems of both countries. President Mubarak delivered the first speech, stating that the special relationship between the two countries and their peoples is based on deep historical and cultural roots. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1956, leaders from both countries have met and visited each other to deepen mutual understanding and achieve creative cooperation in various fields, further advancing the shared journey of the two nations.

President Mubarak emphasized that another factor contributing to the strengthening of bilateral relations is the close alignment of the two countries' positions on major international and regional issues of concern to all peoples. As we approach the 21st century, the world is undergoing profound changes that will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the development of the international situation.

He said, "Both our countries welcome the easing of international tensions and the confrontation between East and West, and we demand that the current international détente be used to make more progress on issues such as the reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons, the elimination of the danger of a destructive world war, the establishment of international relations based on justice and equal opportunity, and the participation of all countries in the formulation of new concepts of coexistence and cooperation without control and manipulation."

President Mubarak stated that Egypt and China share similar views on the Middle East issue, noting that China was one of the earliest international forces to strive for a comprehensive and just resolution to the Palestinian issue.

He praised China for supporting the implementation of all provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 598 to end the Iraq-Iran conflict, hoping for peace and stability in Lebanon, allowing the Lebanese people to determine their own affairs without external interference, and achieving national reconciliation.

He said, "China has always been at the forefront of supporting the struggles of the African people. China supports the African people in their just struggle for development and progress, against colonialism and exploitation, and to eradicate the system of racial apartheid and racial discrimination in glorious southern Africa."

Chairman Yang Shangkun then spoke at the banquet. He recalled the contributions made by the two ancient civilizations of China and Egypt to enriching human civilization and discussed the mutual sympathy and support between the two countries in their contemporary efforts to seek and defend independence, maintain world peace, oppose hegemony, and develop their respective national economies and cultures.

He said, "We will not forget that Egypt was the first Arab and African country to establish diplomatic relations with China and actively supported the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations, opposing the attempts by a few in the international community to create a 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' plot." "The friendly relations between China and Egypt have withstood the test of time and are a model of interstate relations."

Chairman Yang praised the Egyptian government and people under President Mubarak's leadership for strengthening democracy at home, developing the economy, and working for regional peace and stability, while playing an increasingly important role in international affairs.

Speaking on the current international situation, Chairman Yang noted, "Due to the joint efforts of people around the world, the international situation has shifted from confrontation to dialogue, and from tension to détente. We welcome this trend, which is conducive to maintaining world peace and promoting development. At the same time, we also see that various inherent contradictions and unstable factors in the world still exist, and regional conflicts are far from being resolved. In international political relations, phenomena such as the strong bullying the weak, the rich oppressing the poor, and imposing one's will on others, as well as gross interference in the internal affairs of other countries, are still common. In international economic relations, the unreasonable economic order places developing countries in a highly disadvantageous position, widening the gap between the North and the South, and exacerbating the wealth disparity, making many developing countries face serious economic difficulties. This situation poses a serious threat to world peace and stability, as well as to human progress and development."

Chairman Yang said, "Peace and development are the two major themes of the contemporary world. The path to achieving these two goals lies in establishing a new international political and economic order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence embody the essence of new international relations, reflect the fundamental interests of all countries, and are international relationship norms that have been tested by practice and are the most vital."

Chairman Yang recalled that the late Premier Zhou Enlai, based on the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, proposed five principles for the Chinese government to handle relations with Arab countries, which promoted friendly cooperation between China and Arab countries and ensured its sustained and healthy development. He said, "The Chinese government has always supported the just struggle of the Arab and Palestinian peoples to recover their lost lands and restore their national rights, and supports their efforts to achieve a political solution to the Middle East issue, supports the convening of an international conference on the Middle East and various forms of dialogue deemed appropriate by the relevant parties, and appreciates the unity and cooperation among Arab countries, and their efforts to strengthen themselves. As a sincere friend of the Arab countries, China is willing to continue to actively develop friendly cooperative relations with them in various fields and make its own contribution to the just and reasonable resolution of the Middle East issue."

In discussing the situation in Africa, Chairman Yang, after evaluating the positive changes taking place in Africa, pointed out, "Africa still faces severe challenges and difficulties. We believe that the great African people, who have won national independence, will certainly be able to overcome various difficulties and achieve economic revitalization and prosperity. China will continue to firmly support the just struggle of African countries against hegemony, colonialism, and racism, and support the reasonable suggestions and claims of African countries to revitalize their national economies and defend their legitimate rights and interests."

Chairman Yang congratulated President Mubarak on his election as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, wishing him outstanding contributions to the prosperity and progress of Africa during his tenure.

In discussing the domestic situation in China, Chairman Yang said, "Practice has proven that the path we have chosen is correct, and the people are satisfied. Currently, the national situation is stable, and social order is normal. The overriding task in China now is to develop the economy in a stable situation."

The speeches of both sides were frequently met with enthusiastic applause.

    穆巴拉克总统盛宴欢迎杨主席
    穆巴拉克说两国领导人互访使两国共同历程进一步发展
    杨尚昆说中埃两国间的友好关系堪称国与国关系的典范
    本报开罗12月18日电　记者成元生、林皎明报道：中国国家主席杨尚昆今晚在开罗赞扬中埃两国友谊的不断发展，强调中国“坚定不移地执行改革开放政策，继续奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，在和平共处五项原则的基础上同世界各国发展友好合作关系。加强和发展同第三世界国家的友好关系是中国对外政策的一个重要立足点”。
    他的这番讲话是在穆巴拉克总统举行的欢迎宴会上发表的。
    夜幕降临，埃及总统府灯火辉煌，乐队不断奏出悠扬乐曲，洋溢着中埃友好的热烈气氛。穆巴拉克总统在门厅迎候中国国家主席，两位领导人在休息室亲切交谈，随后与中埃两国出席宴会的政府高级官员一一握手，步入宴会厅。
    欢迎宴会在中埃两国国歌声中开始。穆巴拉克总统首先致词。他说，中埃两国和两国人民的特殊关系，基于深刻的历史和文化渊源。自两国1956年建交以来，两国各级领导人为加深相互了解、实现各个领域创造性合作而进行会晤和互访，使两国共同历程得到进一步发展。
    穆巴拉克总统强调指出，两国关系得以不断加强的另一个因素是，“我们双方在各国人民所关心的重大国际和地区问题上的立场极其接近。当前，在我们即将跨入第二十一世纪的时候，世界正面临着接踵而来的深刻变化，这些变化势必要对国际局势的发展产生明显影响。”
    他说，“我们两国都欢迎缓和国际紧张局势和东、西方之间的对立，并要求利用当前的国际缓和气氛就裁减核武器和常规武器，消除爆发毁灭性世界大战的危险，建立以公正和机会均等为原则的国际关系，使所有国家均能不受控制和操纵地参与制定共处和合作新概念等问题取得更多的进展。”
    穆巴拉克总统说，埃中两国在中东问题上的立场是相近的，“贵国是最早为全面、公正解决巴勒斯坦问题而奋斗的国际力量之一”。
    他赞扬“中国支持在实施安理会598号决议全部条款的基础上结束伊拉克、伊朗争端，希望在黎巴嫩土地上实现和平与稳定，让黎巴嫩人民有机会在没有外来干涉的情况下决定自己的事务，实现全国和解。”
    他说，“中国过去和现在都始终站在支持非洲人民斗争的最前列。中国支持非洲人民为谋求发展和进步、为反对殖民主义和剥削和为在光荣的南部非洲根除种族隔离和种族歧视制度而进行的正当斗争。”
    杨尚昆主席接着在欢迎宴会上讲话。他回述了中埃两个文明古国为丰富人类文明作出宝贵贡献，并谈到中埃两国在当代人类争取和捍卫独立、维护世界和平、反对霸权主义、发展各自民族经济和文化的事业中相互同情，相互支持，结下深厚的友谊。
    他说：“我们不会忘记，埃及是第一个同中国建交的阿拉伯和非洲国家，并积极支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，反对国际上少数人企图制造‘两个中国’或‘一中一台’的阴谋。”“中埃两国间的友好关系经受了岁月的考验，堪称国与国关系的典范。”
    杨主席赞扬埃及政府和人民在穆巴拉克总统领导下，对内加强民主，发展经济，对外致力于地区和平与稳定，并在国际事务中发挥着日益重要的作用。
    在谈到当前国际形势时，杨主席指出，“由于全世界人民的共同努力，国际形势由对抗转向对话，由紧张趋向缓和。我们对这一有利于维护世界和平、促进发展的趋势表示欢迎。同时，我们也看到，世界各种固有的矛盾和不稳定的因素依然存在，地区冲突还远未解决。在国际政治关系中，以大欺小，以强凌弱，以富压贫，把自己的意志强加于人，粗暴干涉他国内政的现象仍然屡见不鲜。在国际经济关系中，不合理的经济秩序使发展中国家处于极为不利的地位，南北差距拉大、贫富悬殊，许多发展中国家的经济面临着严重的困难。这种状况使世界的和平与稳定、人类的进步与发展受到严重的威胁。”
    杨主席说，“和平与发展是当今世界所面临的两大主题。实现这两项目标的途径在于建立以和平共处五项原则为基础的国际政治、经济新秩序。和平共处五项原则体现了新型国际关系的本质，反映了一切国家的根本利益，是经过实践考验的、最富有生命力的国际关系准则。”
    杨主席回顾说，已故周恩来总理根据和平共处五项原则精神提出的中国政府处理同阿拉伯国家关系的五项原则，促进了中国同阿拉伯国家之间的友好合作关系，并使之得到了持续健康的发展。他说，“中国政府一贯支持阿拉伯和巴勒斯坦人民为收复失地和恢复民族权利而进行的正义斗争，支持他们为实现中东问题的政治解决所作的努力，支持召开中东国际和会和有关各方进行他们认为合适的各种形式的对话，赞赏阿拉伯国家之间团结合作，联合自强。中国作为阿拉伯国家的真诚朋友，愿继续积极发展同他们在各个领域的友好合作关系，愿为推动中东问题的公正、合理解决作出自己的贡献。”
    在谈到非洲形势时，杨主席在评价了非洲形势正在发生的积极变化后指出，“非洲仍然面临着严峻困难和挑战。我们相信，伟大的非洲人民既然能够赢得国家独立，也一定有能力克服各种困难，实现经济振兴和繁荣。中国将继续坚定不移地支持非洲国家反对霸权主义、殖民主义和种族主义的正义斗争，支持非洲国家振兴民族经济和维护正当权益的合理建议和主张。”
    杨主席祝贺穆巴拉克总统荣任非统组织主席，祝愿他在担任这一崇高职务期间为非洲的繁荣和进步作出杰出的贡献。
    杨主席在谈到中国国内情况时说：“实践证明，我们选择的道路是正确的，人民是满意的。现在全国形势稳定，社会秩序正常。目前中国压倒一切的任务就是在稳定的局势下发展经济。”
    双方的讲话不时博得热烈的掌声。（附图片）
