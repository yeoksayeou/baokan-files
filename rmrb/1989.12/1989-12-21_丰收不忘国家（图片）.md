Young farmer Li Renyu from Lixiang Village, Liu Xin Township, Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, took over 21 acres of low-yielding fields in 1986. Through meticulous cultivation and scientific management, he has achieved continuous increases in grain production. Li Renyu, mindful of the state's needs even in times of abundance, has sold over 50,000 kilograms of grain to the state over four years. This autumn, he again sold 8,000 kilograms of rice to the state in one go, earning him the title of "Grain Sales Champion" from the provincial government. The top right image shows him during the grain sale, and the bottom image shows the three trucks of rice he delivered this autumn.
