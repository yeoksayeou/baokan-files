Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 26th.

The State Council has decided to appropriately raise the purchase price of flue-cured tobacco next year. At the same time, the current rational tobacco production support policies will remain in place.

This year's total tobacco production and purchase volume are on par with or slightly higher than the bumper harvest of 1988. Due to the implementation of national standards and the rectification of the purchase order, the proportion of top-grade tobacco nationwide decreased from 35.8% last year to 11.9% this year (as of the end of October), and the tobacco grade qualification rate has significantly improved. This change has also resulted in lower incomes for tobacco-producing areas and farmers compared to last year.

Director Jiang Ming of the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau pointed out that next year's tobacco production will continue to promote standardized production and adhere to national standards, preventing the rise of inferior and mixed varieties.

    烤烟收购价格明年适当上调
    本报讯　记者莫新元报道：据最近在北京召开的全国烟叶生产收购工作会议透露，国务院决定明年将适当上调烤烟收购价格。同时，现行合理的烟叶生产扶持政策还仍然保留。
    今年烟叶的总产量和收购量与丰收的1988年持平或略有增加。由于执行了国家标准，治理整顿了收购秩序，全国上等烟的比例由去年的35.8％下降到今年的11.9％（10月底统计），烟叶等级合格率有较大提高。这一变化，也使产烟区和烟农的收入低于去年。
    国家烟草专卖局局长江明指出，明年的烟叶生产，要继续推行规范化生产，坚持执行国家标准，不能让劣杂品种抬头。
