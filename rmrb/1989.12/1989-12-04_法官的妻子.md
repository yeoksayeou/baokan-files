In the residential area of the People's Court of Tai County, Jiangsu Province, there is an unwritten rule among the families: anyone seeking the residence of court staff must first have their identity verified. If they are a party to a case or a related individual, they are asked to go to the office to discuss matters. If they come bearing gifts, the families are even more resolute in turning them away.

This court has always had strict requirements for its officers, so some people try to find a way in through their families. Tai County People's Court, on the one hand, frequently urges its staff to strengthen education for their families, and on the other hand, the court leadership encourages families to be supportive spouses who help the officers uphold justice. Once, the wife of Administrative Court judge Yu Shikang was doing housework when she heard a knock at the door. She hurriedly opened it to find a stranger holding a few old hens and some large fish at the doorstep. She immediately became alert. She blocked the doorway and asked the man where he was from, how he knew Yu, and why he was bringing gifts. The man became nervous and stammered for a while but couldn't give a clear answer. "He must be a party to a case," thought Yu's wife. She guessed and then "bang" shut the door, leaving the man embarrassed and walking away.

Some families living in rural areas, although facing difficulties, prefer to live a hard life rather than accept gifts from parties involved in cases. Once, a court judge, Liu Jinqi, handled a divorce case. Soon, the plaintiff found his way to Liu's rural home. Liu's wife received him. Before they could talk for a few minutes, the man took advantage of her distraction and dropped five or six pounds of fish on the ground and left. Liu's wife discovered this and hurried to find the man but couldn't. Liu returned and rode fifteen kilometers to the court to hand over the fish for public handling.

    法官的妻子
    周龙喜
    在江苏省泰县人民法院宿舍区，家属们有一条不成文的规定：见到查找法院工作人员住处的，都先要查明其身份。如果是案件当事人或关系人，就请他到办公室谈去，如果还带着礼品登门，家属们更是不留情面地将他们拒之门外。
    这个法院对干警要求历来严格，于是有人就想从他们家属身上打开缺口。泰县人民法院一方面经常要求工作人员加强对家属的教育，另一方面法院领导鼓励家属们做积极支持干警秉公执法的贤内助。一次，行政庭审判员于世康的妻子正在做家务，一阵敲门声响起，她忙打开门，只见一个陌生人拎着几只老母鸡和几条大鱼站在门口。她顿时警惕起来。她侧身拦在门口，问那人是什么地方人？怎么认识老于的？为什么要送礼给他？那人被问得紧张起来，支吾了好一阵也没说出个啥名堂。“一定是个当事人。”老于的爱人一边猜测，一边“呯”地一声把门关上，弄得那人尴尬地走了。
    一些家在农村的家属，虽然生活比较困难，但他们宁可过清苦的日子，也不肯受当事人的礼品。一次，有个法庭审判员刘金琦受理了一起离婚案件。不久，原告就找到老刘乡下的家中。老刘的爱人接待了他。还没谈几句话，那人便乘她不注意，将五六斤鱼往地上一丢就走了。老刘的爱人发现后急忙找那人，没找到。老刘回来后，骑车十五公里，把鱼送到法院交公处理了。
