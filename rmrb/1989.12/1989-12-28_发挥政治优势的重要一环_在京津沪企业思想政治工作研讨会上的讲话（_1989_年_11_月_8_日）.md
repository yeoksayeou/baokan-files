At this seminar on ideological and political work in enterprises, comrades have shared many valuable opinions. Today, as a participant in this seminar, I would also like to share some of my thoughts.

First, we must highly value and strengthen ideological and political work in enterprises. One reason is that due to Zhao Ziyang's weakening or downplaying of ideological and political work, over the past few years, bourgeois liberalization has run rampant, causing many problems and confusion. Many of our statements are contradictory or unclear, and we need to quickly study and clarify these issues to provide accurate guidance. Second, after the political turmoil of this spring and summer, and after several months of work, most people have developed a relatively correct understanding. However, we cannot deny that some comrades still have knots or buttons in their minds that need to be untied. Why did this political turmoil occur? Fundamentally, it was due to the planned and organized conspiracies of some domestic and foreign hostile forces, and the rampant bourgeois liberalization aimed at overthrowing our Party and the socialist system. At the same time, we must admit that due to some mistakes in our work over the past few years, the masses indeed have some grievances against us, and this turmoil reflected some of their dissatisfaction. Regarding the planners, organizers, and leaders of the counter-revolutionary riots, as well as those who committed crimes such as arson, looting, and murder, we must punish them severely according to law and resolutely crack down on them without leniency. However, for the broad masses who were drawn into the turmoil, we must educate and unite them. For them, the main task is self-education, summarizing experiences, and learning from lessons. If they cannot understand immediately, we can wait. In short, we must strive to win over and unite the majority, so that the few bad elements can truly be isolated. If this view is correct, then we need to do a lot of patient and detailed work to untie the knots or buttons in their minds and help them improve their ideological understanding.

Third, the arduous tasks of rectification and deepening reform require the strong support of ideological and political work. Over the past decade, our economic construction and reform and opening-up have achieved tremendous successes, but we have also encountered some serious difficulties and problems in the process. Now, the Central Committee is holding a meeting to study how to solve the economic difficulties we face and to formulate the guiding principles, main tasks, and basic measures for further rectification and deepening reform. To get our national economy out of the predicament and onto a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development, the country must make some major strategic adjustments and deployments. For example, we need to tighten spending, call on everyone to tighten their belts for a few years, and mobilize local support for the central government's finances, etc. But these measures alone are not enough; we must also have the strong leadership of the Party, the exemplary role of Party members, and carry out in-depth, detailed, and effective ideological and political work.

There are many ways in which socialism is superior to capitalism, but the most important point is that in a socialist society, in socialist enterprises, the people are the true masters. Developing socialist enterprises requires efforts in many areas, such as introducing advanced technology, carrying out technological transformations, strengthening modern management, and implementing the factory director responsibility system. The most fundamental aspect, however, is to improve the quality of people and fully tap the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the broad masses of workers. The ultimate goal of enterprise reform is precisely this. The people are the subjects of practice and cognition. We often say that cognition comes from practice, and this practice refers to social practice, the practice of the people. The wisdom of our Party comes from the people's practice of transforming the world. The people are the driving force behind historical progress. The nature of history and its direction of development are ultimately determined by the people. Reform is the people's activity of creating history. Serving the people wholeheartedly is the highest purpose of our Party, and the people are the objects of our service. Therefore, leveraging our political advantages, strengthening ideological and political work, and fully tapping the active role of people should be the starting point and the ultimate goal of our ideological and political work in enterprises.

Strengthening ideological and political work is a crucial link in leveraging political advantages. By political advantages, we mean one of the basic experiences formed by our Party in its long-term revolutionary and construction work under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and also one of the important characteristics that distinguish our socialist system from capitalism. In modern Chinese history, from the Opium War in 1840, China has long suffered from the invasion, enslavement, and exploitation of imperialism. In these more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have mainly struggled for national independence and liberation and for the survival of the nation, and have not been able to concentrate on economic and cultural construction. Therefore, it is understandable that we have fallen behind Western countries in economics, science and technology, and cultural education. At the same time, we must also see that in these more than a hundred years of arduous struggle, the Chinese people have fought bravely, sacrificed, and paid a huge price, gradually forming their own set of things. I have told foreigners in Tianjin that you can learn from our things, but you cannot learn from our set of things. This set of things is our political advantage, and ideological and political work is an important part of it. Now, some problems in our economic and social development cannot be well solved, and one of the important reasons is that we have not done enough research and leverage of our political advantages. For example, social order is not good, and there are reasons such as the lack of modern equipment needed to maintain social order, but I think there is a more important reason, which is that we have neglected people's work and ideological and political work. Therefore, fully leveraging our political advantages, strengthening ideological and political work, and strengthening people's education work is both our traditional advantage and a very prominent and urgent task at present.

Second, we must make ideological and political work adapt to new situations. What is the purpose of ideological and political work? Your bulletin says it is to implement the Party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism and to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is correct. Specifically, at present, ideological and political work is to improve the ideological awareness of the broad masses of workers, to untie the knots or buttons in the minds of the broad masses and workers, so that everyone can be spirited and united, and strive for the realization of various targets proposed by the Central Committee; at the same time, in the process of struggle, workers can also be educated, that is, while transforming the objective world, their subjective world can also be transformed. This is what some comrades mentioned earlier, that our enterprise's goal is not only to produce material products but also to produce spiritual products and to cultivate a new generation. In other words, we have always said that we should carry out two tasks at the same time, two civilizations at the same time, two burdens at the same time, and two results at the same time.

To achieve better results in enterprise ideological and political work, we must work hard to study how its methods and approaches can adapt to the current objective reality. Ideological and political work is first and foremost an issue of strengthening. However, if the issue of adaptation is not well resolved, strengthening will not be achieved. Simply emphasizing the importance of ideological and political work and ignoring the many special situations at present, without seriously studying how to make our ideological and political work popular among the masses, will not achieve the desired results of ideological and political work. Our debate with Zhao Ziyang on the issue of ideological and political work is first and foremost about whether to strengthen it or not. At the same time, we do not deny that there is an issue of adaptation. We admit that compared to the past, ideological and political work has undergone many changes, not only in the objects, content, methods, and approaches of the work, but also in the changes within the ideological and political work team itself, and the external environment and conditions of ideological and political work have also undergone a series of changes. Under these new historical conditions, how to carry out ideological and political work in depth is indeed an issue of studying new situations, solving new problems, and adapting to new environments. In the process of strengthening our ideological and political work, we should consciously seek to solve these problems step by step.

Our ideological and political work has many traditional and effective methods and approaches. At least, a few that have left a deep impression on me are as follows. First, organizing daily study and propaganda, including studying theory, studying the spirit of the Central Committee's reports, and studying current affairs. Second, carrying out in-depth and detailed individual ideological work. This was our forte in the past. The Party organization relied on cadres to analyze the ideological emotions of different individuals, help them untie knots, and solve difficulties. In the past, there was a whole set of methods, such as using one key to open one lock, etc. I remember that I once summarized the experience of doing work with backward individuals, which was called matching the key to the lock, oiling the rusty lock first, daring to give work, and cultivating self-respect. The thought problem is compared to a lock, and the key is matched after the lock is found. Oiling the rusty lock first is to say that for a very backward person, a difficult person, you have to oil them a little bit, slowly poke them, and don't be too hurried, otherwise the key will break. Third, carrying out various forms of learning from advanced individuals. Establishing advanced models among the masses and carrying out self-education activities such as learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing. Fourth, giving full play to the exemplary role of Party members, League members, and model figures, leading and influencing the broad masses to move forward in the direction indicated by our Party. Fifth, carrying out various activities that the masses like and enjoy, incorporating education into activities, such as playing ball, watching operas, and watching movies. Sixth, including caring for the lives of the masses in the content of ideological and political work. I think that this whole set of methods from the past, which ones are still useful now, which ones are basically usable but need to be given new content and forms, like a prescription for taking traditional Chinese medicine, should be changed and adjusted. We cannot just say that others are backward; we must study our methods and approaches well.

I think that ideological and political work has a basic principle that should be followed, which is self-education first and positive education first. Generally speaking, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages, and these two things often complement and accompany each other. Sometimes strength is the cause of weakness, and sometimes weakness is the result of strength. The responsibility of ideological and political workers and leading cadres is to first see a person's strengths and advantages and, in the process of fully developing his strengths and advantages, to compensate for his weaknesses and overcome his disadvantages, rather than first grabbing a person's weaknesses and picking on his disadvantages to control him. Politically, the masses are after all the objects of our service; theoretically, the masses' ideological understanding problems must ultimately be solved by the masses themselves. Criticism and self-criticism are our Party's fine tradition. But the purpose of criticism is to promote self-criticism by the criticized person. If the criticized person cannot achieve self-criticism, he cannot truly correct his mistakes. How to carry out self-education and positive education, how to carry out lively, vivid, and effective various forms of activities that the masses like and enjoy, so that everyone can be educated unconsciously in this process, we still lack a lot of experience in this aspect.

Everyone knows that in our feudal society, many people are familiar with Confucianism and Mencius, of course, it has its negative effects, I won't talk about that side. Just say its popularity, from singing, storytelling, chatting, to various kinds of books, especially after the Southern Song Dynasty, there were things like the "Daughter's Classic," "Child Prodigy Poetry," "Family Precepts," including small things like the "Three-Character Classic" and the "Thousand-Character Classic," there was a whole set. Even in poor and remote rural areas, old women who have never read any books, when two people squat at the wall root and chat, it's all about loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness, three feet above has spirits, don't do evil deeds, etc. After thousands of years of indoctrination and influence in feudal society, every family knows Confucianism and Mencius. In comparison, our propaganda and education, moral popularization are far behind. In the future, we must strengthen this aspect of work, through various mass activities, so that people unconsciously and imperceptibly receive education in patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and communism, gradually achieving our educational goals. This is a huge social project, and we should be determined to complete this project. The conditions now are certainly much better than in feudal society, and we can definitely do better than it.

Comrades also raised some specific issues at the meeting, such as how to view the enterprise law, how to explain the roles of the "center" and "core" of the two "hearts," etc. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Central Committee has said a lot about strengthening ideological and political work, and the main spirit is to hope that the enterprise Party committee will focus its main efforts on ideological and political work, share some of the workload with the factory director, and the Party committee has a ready-made team that has experience in doing ideological work, which can make this work better sustained. Whether the "center" is bigger or the "core" is bigger, it doesn't make sense to argue about this. Whether it is the "center" or the "core," everyone should be of one mind. A document at the organizational work conference mentioned that the appointment of middle-level cadres in enterprises is nominated by the factory director, discussed and decided by the Party committee, and then appointed by the factory director. This does not hinder the factory director's right to nominate and appoint, but requires discussion by the enterprise Party committee. I think most of our factory directors are members of the Party committee and should not be so uncomfortable hearing this. It is safer to discuss it in the Party committee. For example, if I am to be the factory director, if someone says they are willing to discuss it, that's great, you discuss it quickly, and I am free from suspicion. Since you have nothing to hide, you don't want to do anything underhanded, pulling and dragging, forming cliques, then discussing it in the Party committee, putting it on the table, what's wrong with that? One person decides everything, appoints people and teams, and now it seems that many problems have been exposed. Of course, if the Party committee manages too much and too detailed, it also has drawbacks. We should respect the authority of the factory director and not return to the old path of doing everything for them, but also summarize the experiences and lessons of the past few years, give full play to the role of the Party committee in the enterprise, make the Party committee do more work in the ideological and political aspects, and make the factory director have more energy to study production management and administrative command. I think this way has more advantages. On this issue, I hope everyone will summarize practical experience and ultimately promote the resolution of this issue as soon as possible. This is of great significance for our country to maintain a stable situation and ensure the smooth implementation of economic adjustments under the current circumstances.

    发挥政治优势的重要一环
    ——在京津沪企业思想政治工作研讨会上的讲话
    （1989年11月8日）
    李瑞环
    在这次企业思想政治工作研讨会上，同志们发表了不少好意见。今天，我作为参加研讨的一员，也讲点意见。
    第一，必须高度重视和加强企业思想政治工作。一是，由于赵紫阳同志削弱或者淡化思想政治工作，近几年来资产阶级自由化泛滥，许多问题搞得很乱，一些提法互相打架或混乱不清，需要尽快地加以研究和澄清，有个准确的说法。二是，今年春夏之交政治风波之后，经过近几个月的工作，多数人有了较为正确的看法，但也不能够否认，一部分同志思想上至今还存在着一些疙瘩或扣子，需要进一步解开。为什么会发生这场政治风波？从根本上讲，是国内外一些敌对势力对我们进行有计划、有组织的阴谋活动，资产阶级自由化泛滥，企图推翻我们的党和社会主义制度。同时，也必须承认，由于我们这几年工作中的一些失误，群众对我们确有一些意见，这次风波反映出群众对我们有一些不满情绪。对于反革命暴乱的策划者、组织者，非法组织的头头，打、砸、抢、烧、杀等犯罪分子，必须依法严惩，坚决打击，绝不能心慈手软。但对于卷进去的广大群众，则必须也只能是教育和团结，对他们来说，主要是通过自我教育，总结经验，吸取教训，一时想不通，还可以等待。总之，我们必须做到争取、团结大多数，只有这样，极少数坏人才能真正被孤立起来。如果这个看法成立，那么就需要我们针对不同的对象做大量的、耐心细致的工作，解开他们思想上的扣子或疙瘩，帮助他们提高思想认识。三是，治理整顿、深化改革的艰巨任务需要思想政治工作的有力配合。10年来我们的经济建设和改革开放取得了巨大的成绩，但是前进中也确实面临着一些严重困难和问题。现在中央正在开会，研究如何解决经济上面临的困难，制定进一步治理整顿和深化改革的指导方针、主要任务和基本措施。为了使我国国民经济走出困境，走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道，国家要从战略上采取一些重大的调整部署，这是非常必要的。比如说，要紧缩支出，号召大家过几年紧日子，动员地方支持一下中央的财政，等等。但单有这些还不够，必须有党的坚强领导，党员的模范带头作用，开展深入细致、卓有成效的思想政治工作。
    社会主义优越于资本主义的地方可以讲很多，其中最重要的一点，就是在社会主义社会中，在社会主义企业中，人民群众是真正的主人。发展社会主义企业需要多方面努力，如引进先进技术、进行技术改造、强化现代化管理、加强厂长负责制等，最根本的还是靠提高人的素质，充分发挥广大职工的主动性、积极性和创造性。企业改革的目的归根到底也在于此。人民群众是实践、认识的主体。我们常讲认识来源于实践，这个实践指的是社会的实践，是人民群众的实践。我们党的智慧，来源于人民群众改造世界的实践。人民群众是推动历史前进的动力。历史是什么样、将向哪个方向发展，归根到底，决定的力量是人民。改革是人民群众创造历史的活动。全心全意为人民服务是我们党的最高宗旨，人民群众是我们服务的对象。所以，发挥我们的政治优势，加强思想政治工作，充分发挥人的积极作用，这应该是我们企业思想政治工作的出发点和落脚点。
    加强思想政治工作是发挥政治优势的重要一环。所谓政治优势，就是我们党在长期的革命和建设中，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指导下所形成的基本经验之一，也是我国社会主义区别于资本主义的重要特征之一。在中国近代史上，从1840年鸦片战争起，中国长期遭受帝国主义的侵略、奴役和剥削。在这一百多年中，中国人民主要致力于争取民族的独立和解放，争取国家的生存，不可能集中精力去进行经济建设和文化建设，因而在经济、科学技术和文化教育等方面落后于西方国家，这是完全可以理解的。同时我们也必须看到，在这一百多年艰苦卓绝的斗争中，中国人民前赴后继，牺牲奋斗，付出了巨大代价，也逐步形成了自己一整套东西。我在天津和外国人讲，你们的东西我可以学来，我们这套东西你们学不了。这套东西就是我们的政治优势，思想政治工作就是政治优势的重要内容。现在我们经济和社会发展中的一些问题不能得到很好的解决，有多种原因，但很重要的一条就是研究和发挥我们的政治优势不够。比如，社会治安不好，其中有维护社会治安所需要的现代化装备差的原因，但我认为还有一个更重要的原因，是我们忽视了人的工作、思想政治工作。所以，充分发挥我们的政治优势，加强思想政治工作，加强人的教育工作，这既是我们传统的优势，又是当前一项非常突出、非常急迫的任务。
    第二，必须使思想政治工作适应新情况。思想政治工作的目的是什么？你们的简报里讲是为了贯彻党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，建设有中国特色的社会主义。这当然是正确的。具体到当前来讲，思想政治工作就是提高广大职工的思想觉悟，解开广大群众和职工思想里存在的若干扣子或疙瘩，从而使大家精神振奋起来，进一步团结起来，为实现中央提出的各项目标而奋斗；同时在奋斗的过程中，又使职工受到教育，也就是在改造客观世界的同时使自己的主观世界也得到改造。这就是刚才有的同志讲的，我们企业的目标不仅仅是出物质产品，还要出精神产品，要培养一代新人。也就是我们过去讲的，两个任务一起下，两个文明一起抓，两副担子一起挑，两个成果一起要。
    企业思想政治工作要取得更好的成效，就必须下功夫认真研究它的方式、方法如何与当前的客观实际相适应。思想政治工作首先是个加强的问题，因为不讲加强就谈不上适应。但是适应的问题解决不好，也就达不到加强。只强调思想政治工作的重要性，忽视当前许许多多的特殊情况，不去认真研究如何使我们的思想政治工作为群众所喜闻乐见，就收不到思想政治工作应有的效果。我们和赵紫阳同志在思想政治工作问题上的争论，首先是要不要加强的问题，但与此同时我们并不否认有一个适应的问题。我们承认现在思想政治工作和过去比，有了许许多多的不同，不仅工作的对象、内容、方式方法发生了变化，思想政治工作队伍自身发生了变化，而且思想政治工作的外部环境和条件也发生了一系列的变化。在这种新的历史条件下，思想政治工作如何深入开展，就确有一个研究新情况、解决新问题、适应新环境的问题。在我们加强思想政治工作的过程中，应该以高度的自觉性，逐步地求得这些问题的解决。
    我们的思想政治工作有很多传统的、曾行之有效的方式和方法，起码对我印象较深的就有几条。第一，组织日常的学习和宣传，包括学习理论，学习中央的精神、报告，学习时事。第二，进行深入细致的个别人的思想工作。这是我们过去最拿手的一招。党组织依靠骨干，针对不同对象，分析其思想情绪，帮助其解疙瘩，排忧解难。过去有这么一整套，如什么一把钥匙开一把锁等。我记得当时我还总结过做后进人工作的经验，叫做按锁配钥匙，锈锁先膏油，大胆给工作，培养自尊心。把思想问题比做锁，是先有了锁，钥匙后配。锈锁先膏油是讲那个很落后的人，难办的人，你得先点点儿油，慢慢再捅，你不要太急，不然把钥匙断掉了。第三，开展各种形式的学先进活动。树立群众里面的先进典型，开展比、学、赶、帮这样的群众自我教育活动。第四，发挥党团员和模范人物的骨干带头作用，带动、影响广大群众，朝着我们党所指引的方向前进。第五，开展各种群众喜闻乐见的活动，寓教育于活动之中，如打球、看戏、看电影等。第六，把关心群众生活纳入思想政治工作的内容。我在想，过去的这一整套方法，现在哪些还有用，哪些基本可用，但需要赋予新的内容和形式，像服中药的药方似的，变一变，调一调。不能光说人家落后，要很好研究一下我们的方式方法。
    我觉得思想政治工作有个基本的东西，恐怕是应该遵循的，就是自我教育为主，正面教育为主。就一般来讲，任何人都有长处和短处，优点和缺点，而且这两种东西常常是相辅相成、相互伴生的，有时长是短的原因，有时短是长的结果。思想政治工作者、领导干部的责任，就在于必须首先看到一个人的长处和优点，在充分发挥他的长处和优点的过程中，去弥补他的短处，克服他的缺点，而不是首先抓人短处，抠人缺点，把人治住。从政治上讲，群众毕竟是我们服务的对象；从理论上讲，群众的思想认识问题毕竟要靠群众自己解决。批评与自我批评是我们党的优良传统。但批评的目的在于促进被批评的人自我批评，如果被批评者不能做到自我批评，他就不能真的改正错误。如何进行自我教育、正面教育，如何开展生动活泼的、形象有力的、群众喜闻乐见的各种形式的活动，使大家在这个过程中受到潜移默化的教育，这方面还相差甚远，还很缺乏经验。
    大家知道，在我国封建社会中，孔孟之道许多人都很熟悉，当然有它的负作用，我不谈这一面。就说它的普及程度，从唱戏、说书、聊天、编故事，到各种各样的书，特别在南宋以后，出了什么《女儿经》、《神童诗》、《治家格言》，包括小小的《三字经》、《千字文》，有一整套。穷乡僻壤农村老太太，什么书都没有看过，但两人蹲墙根儿聊天，都是些忠孝节义，三尺以上有神灵，不做亏心事等等。封建社会经过千百年的灌输、熏陶，千方百计使孔孟之道家喻户晓。相比之下，我们的宣传教育、道德普及就差得太多了。今后我们必须加强这方面的工作，通过各种群众性的活动，使人们不知不觉、潜移默化地受到爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义、共产主义的教育，逐步达到我们的教育目的。这是个很大的社会工程，我们应下决心完成这个工程。现在的条件总要比封建社会好得多，完全可以比它做得更好。
    大家在会上还提了一些具体问题，比如说对企业法怎么看，所谓“中心”和“核心”这两个“心”的作用怎么解释，等等。十三届四中全会后，中央就加强思想政治工作问题讲了不少话，主要精神就是希望企业党委把主要的力量放在思想政治工作上去，给厂长分担一部分工作量，而且党委有现成的一套人马，又都有做思想工作的经验，可以使这项工作更好地坚持下去。究竟是“中心”大还是“核心”大，争这个也没什么意思。不管是“中心”，还是“核心”，大家都应一条心。组工会议上有一个文件讲到，企业中层干部任用，由厂长提名，党委讨论决定，然后由厂长任命。这样做，并没有妨碍厂长提名、任命的权力，只是要求经过企业党委讨论。我想我们的厂长多数都是党委的成员，不应该听了这个话就那么别扭吧。党委讨论讨论总比个人说了算保险。比如说要我当厂长，如果有人说愿意讨论，那很好，你赶快讨论，我免担嫌疑。你既然没有什么见不得人的事，不想搞邪门歪道，拉拉扯扯，团团伙伙，那么党委讨论，亮在桌面上，有什么不好呢？一个人说了算，定人、定班子，现在看来暴露的问题不少。当然党委管得过多过细也有弊病。既要尊重厂长的权力，不要返回到过去包办代替的路子上去，也要总结这几年的经验教训，充分发挥党委在企业中的作用，使党委在思想政治方面多做一些工作，使厂长有更多的精力来研究生产管理、行政指挥的工作。我觉得这样做好处较多。在这个问题上，希望各位总结一下实践经验，最后能促使这个问题尽快得到妥善的解决。这对于我们国家在当前情况下保持稳定的局面，保证经济调整顺利进行，具有非常重要的意义。
