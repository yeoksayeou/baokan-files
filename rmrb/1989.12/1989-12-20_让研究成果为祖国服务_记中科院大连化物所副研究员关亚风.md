Let Research Achievements Serve the Motherland

    —A Record of Vice Researcher Guan Yafeng of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    January 1989.

    The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Eindhoven University of Technology.

    Guan Yafeng, a young Chinese scholar conducting postdoctoral research here, proposed to his supervisor that he had completed the two research topics originally planned and intended to return to China ahead of schedule.

    Supervisor: "Dear Dr. Guan, I find it hard to understand you as a Chinese person. We both know the current living standards in China. Among the Chinese students studying in the Netherlands, some are trying to extend their study time, but why do you want to leave early?"

    Unlike ordinary Chinese students studying abroad, Guan Yafeng, who was sent by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was a Ph.D. in science who had completed his studies in China. He first went to Italy for postdoctoral research in chromatography, then to the Netherlands. This university hired him as a lecturer. Guan Yafeng's wife also came to the Netherlands to study.

    The favorable living conditions allowed them to live without the need for part-time work, and during holidays, the couple could travel together to several European countries. If they returned to China early, it would mean immediately giving up this lifestyle. No wonder others did not understand.

    Guan Yafeng had his own thoughts. He saw that foreigners hired here were being rehired year after year, far from their homeland, working until old age. He felt that if his abilities could not be integrated into the motherland's cause, even if he were rehired year after year, even if the living conditions were better, it would be a dead end.

    Studying abroad is for the motherland. Since the two planned topics had been completed, he decided to return to the motherland and, while the iron is hot, complete the follow-up part of the topics in China, so that high-tech achievements could bear the mark of China.

    In February 1989, Guan Yafeng returned.

    The socialist motherland gave him an even broader field for his talents. In the contemporary field of analytical chemistry, capillary chromatography is a hot topic that scholars from various countries are competing to research. Guan Yafeng's research topic in the Netherlands was "Retention Index of Temperature Programmed Capillary Gas Chromatography," and he used computer simulation methods. After returning to China, Guan Yafeng proposed to continue researching this topic. The Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics immediately approved a research fund for him to use. In September 1989, the National Youth Science Fund Chemistry Science Class Review Meeting also approved Guan Yafeng's application, providing funding for his "Fast Qualitative Analysis Database Without Standards Under Programmed Temperature Conditions in Capillary Chromatography" project.

    Experts commented that Guan Yafeng's research on this topic abroad had already put him on the same starting line as his foreign counterparts; if his subsequent research in China could achieve the expected success, then he would become the leader in this technological competition.

    In September 1989, 32-year-old Guan Yafeng was appointed as an associate researcher by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, becoming the youngest senior intellectual in this research institute. In October 1989, at the Seventh National Chromatography Science Paper Report Meeting held in Beijing, Guan Yafeng participated with four papers. One of his papers, co-authored with Academician Lu Peizhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, and two foreign researchers, was awarded "Excellent Paper." His paper co-authored with his wife Deng Wen (a computer research scientist) on the application of computer-aided chromatography separation optimization was also very eye-catching.

    Thus, he left a brilliant footprint on the domestic academic stage.

    让研究成果为祖国服务
    ——记中科院大连化物所副研究员关亚风
    冯越　邹淑英
    1989年1月。
    荷兰王国，爱因得候温技术大学。
    来这里进行博士后研究的中国青年学者关亚风，向导师提出，他原定的两个科研题目已经做完，他打算提前返回中国。
    导师：“亲爱的关博士，你这个中国人叫我很不理解。中国目前的生活水平，你和我都是知道的。在荷兰的中国留学生，有人正在争取延长学习时间，你怎么反而要提前走呢？”
    同普通的中国留学生不同，由中科院大连化物所派出的关亚风，是国内完成学业的理学博士。他先到意大利进行色谱学方面的博士后研究，又到了荷兰，荷兰的这所大学以讲师的资格聘用了他，关亚风的妻子也到了荷兰一同学习。
    优裕的生活条件使他们不必靠勤工俭学度日，假日里小两口还可以一道旅游欧洲几个国家。如果提前回国，就意味着立即放弃这种生活。怪不得别人不理解。
    关亚风有自己的想法。他看到受聘在这里工作的外国人被一年一年地聘下去，远离祖国，干到老年。他感到，如果自己的能力未能融合到祖国的事业里，即使这样一年一年地被聘下去，即使生活再优裕，也是没有前程的。
    出国留学是为了祖国，既然原定的两个题目已经做完，他决定还是返回祖国，趁热打铁，把题目的后续部分在国内完成，让高科技的成果打上中国的烙印。
    1989年2月，关亚风回来了。
    社会主义祖国给了他更加广阔的用武之地。在当代化学界的分析色谱领域，毛细管色谱是各国学者争相研究的一个热门，关亚风在荷兰研究的课题便是“气相毛细管色谱程序升温的保留指标”，并且采用了计算机模拟方法。回国之后，关亚风提出搞这个课题的后续研究。大连化物所立即批准了一笔科研基金供他使用。1989年9月，国家青年科学基金化学科学类评审会议又通过了关亚风的申请，对他的“毛细管色谱程序升温条件下无标准样快速定性活数据库”课题给予基金资助。
    行家们评价说，关亚风在国外对这一课题的研究，已使他与国外同行们站在同一条起跑线上；回国之后的继续研究如能取得预期的成功，那么他就成为这场科技竞赛中的领跑人了。
    1989年9月，32岁的关亚风被大连化物所聘为副研究员，成为这个研究所最年轻的高级知识分子；1989年10月，在北京举行的全国第七届色谱科学论文报告会上，关亚风带着4篇论文参加，其中有一篇他与中科院学部委员、大连化物所卢佩章研究员和两位外国科研人员合写的论文被评为“优秀论文”，他与妻子邓文（计算机科研人员）合写的应用计算机辅助色谱分离优化的论文也很引人注目。
    就这样，他在国内的学术舞台上留下了光辉的足迹。
