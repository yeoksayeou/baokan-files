A new biological membrane covering technique for treating burn wounds—lymphatic fluid treatment for burns—has been successfully researched and approved by the Jin Hua Hospital of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau.

Domestically and internationally, the medical community generally uses drug dressings to treat burns, but the wound surface is easily infected, and the treatment period is relatively long. In June of this year, Jin Hua Railway Hospital used human lymphatic fluid to treat burns and achieved satisfactory results. This method is superior to conventional dressing treatments in terms of stopping exudation, preventing infection, promoting wound healing, shortening the course of the disease, and reducing patient pain, and there are no adverse reactions.

It is reported that the use of lymphatic fluid to treat burns has not been reported in domestic and international literature to date.

    淋巴液治疗烧伤法获良好效果
    新华社杭州12月16日电  （通讯员朱益民、孟奇）一种治疗烧伤创面的生物膜覆盖法新技术——淋巴液治疗烧伤法，已由杭州铁路分局金华医院研究成功并通过鉴定。
    国内外医学界对烧伤处理一般都采用药物敷料的方法，但创面易感染，疗程较长。今年6月，金华铁路医院将人体淋巴液用于治疗烧伤，取得了满意的效果。这种方法在制止渗液，防止感染，促进创面愈合，缩短病程，减轻患者痛苦等方面，都明显优于常规敷料的治疗方法，而且没有不良反应。
    据悉，淋巴液治疗烧伤至今在国内外文献资料中尚未见报道。
