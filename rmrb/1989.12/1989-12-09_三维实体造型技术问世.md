This People's Daily article reports:

Pressing a key on the keyboard, a vivid 3D model of a residential community appears on the computer screen, resembling a realistic sand table model, giving the viewer a sense of being there. This scene was witnessed at the computer technology appraisal meeting held on December 6 by the General Logistics Department. This technology, known as 3D solid modeling by computer experts, was developed and manufactured by five young scientific and technological workers, all under the age of 30, from the Shenyang Military Region and the General Logistics Department.

Using this technology for residential community construction, designers only need to sit in front of the computer to obtain various building materials for the community. At the same time, they can get the optimal 3D, 2D, and sectional views as well as various construction drawings selected and combined by the computer, allowing them to choose freely. The Beijing Military Region has applied this advanced technology to its key engineering projects, automatically combining design schemes, construction drawings, and engineering plans according to the plan, saving a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Just this item alone can save 200,000 yuan in travel and design fees annually.

    三维实体造型技术问世
    本报讯　按下键盘，面前的计算机荧光屏上便能显现出住宅小区建设彩色实体造型，好似逼真的沙盘模型，给人身临其境之感。
    这是12月6日总后勤部组织召开的计算机技术鉴定会上出现的场面。这种被计算机行家称为三维实体造型的技术，是由沈阳军区和总后的5名平均年龄不到30岁的青年科技工作者开发研制的。采用这一技术进行住宅小区建设，设计人员只要坐在计算机前，就可得到多种小区建筑资料，同时获得计算机优选组合的最佳立体图、平面图及剖面图，以及多种施工图纸，任其选择。北京军区运用这一先进技术对所属重点工程项目，按规划自动组合设计方案、施工图及制定工程计划等，节省大量人力、物力、财力，仅此一项，一年就可节约旅差费、设计费达20万元。　（周保华　孟唤　沈营）
