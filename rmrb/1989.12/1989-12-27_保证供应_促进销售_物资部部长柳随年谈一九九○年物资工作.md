In 1989, China's material supply and demand situation underwent significant changes not seen in many years. At the beginning of the year, material supplies were tight, prices remained high, and inventories decreased. However, after entering the third and fourth quarters of the sales peak season, the situation reversed, with some items experiencing sluggish sales and price drops. Currently, on one hand, the supply-demand contradictions of some important materials have been alleviated, while on the other hand, some materials are experiencing backlogs and accumulation, which brings both joy and worry.

How long will this situation last? What will the material supply and demand situation be like next year? With these questions in mind, the reporter recently visited Minister of the Ministry of Materials Liu Suinian.

"Next year, material supply and demand will have both surpluses and shortages, with backlogs and shortages coexisting," Liu Suinian summarized the 1990 material supply and demand situation. He believes that with the implementation of the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, further rectification and order, the scale of fixed asset investment in 1990 will continue to be compressed, and the scale of credit and the growth of consumption funds will continue to be controlled. The total social supply and demand of most materials can basically be balanced, with backlog phenomena still existing, but some items will still be in short supply.

Liu Suinian has just participated in the national economic planning meeting. This minister predicts that next year, among the main production materials, the supply-demand contradiction of coal will be somewhat alleviated, but high-quality coal, especially main coking coal, will still be in short supply; the total amount of steel will be basically balanced, but due to mismatched varieties, some varieties will still have gaps; non-ferrous metals and some chemical raw materials will still be in short supply. Steel wire rods, cement, flat glass, and other general building materials may experience oversupply; small cars and light trucks will continue to be backlogged. From the transaction situation of the year-end product order meeting, the demand for mechanical and electrical products in 1990 will significantly decrease.

Liu Suinian, who has long been engaged in economic planning work, analyzed from a macroeconomic perspective. He said, "For many years, production materials have been in short supply, which is not a normal phenomenon. Currently, the backlog and accumulation of some materials are relative and temporary; from a total perspective, there is still a shortage of supply. Since the rectification and order, the production materials market has shown relative relaxation and ease, which is exactly what we have hoped for over the years. It has created favorable conditions for overcoming economic overheating and inflation, rationalizing economic relations, and making the national economy enter a virtuous cycle. It also provides a rare opportunity for us to implement national industrial policies, tilt resource allocation, and adjust industrial structure. We should use this opportunity to adjust the industrial structure, product structure, and import-export structure."

When talking about completing the tasks of 1990, Liu Suinian said, "On one hand, we need the support of leaders at all levels and the media for the work of the circulation sector; on the other hand, the materials sector needs to boost morale and work hard, not only to ensure supply but also to promote sales, and to carry both burdens."

Liu Suinian pointed out that ensuring supply means strengthening the overall concept and seriously implementing the mandatory plan. First, ensure the materials needed for agricultural production and the "three materials" for basic agricultural water conservancy construction; second, arrange the planned materials needed for energy, raw material production, transportation, and key construction projects; prioritize the supply of materials needed for national defense and military industry, light industry market-shortage products, foreign exchange-earning products, high-quality brand-name products, and technologically advanced products. The allocation quantity for other aspects will be reduced.

To ensure the implementation of the national unified allocation plan for materials, production enterprises must deliver goods according to contracts and can only sell independently after completing the national mandatory plan. At the same time, strengthen the connection between production and sales, strengthen planning guidance, allocate a certain quantity of independently sold products, and implement fixed-point and fixed-quantity but non-fixed-price supply to supplement the needs of large and medium-sized enterprises and key construction projects.

Liu Suinian told the reporter that the materials sector lacks experience in promoting sales and lacks the ability to adapt to the new situation of backlogs and accumulation of some materials. Currently, we should seriously study the new situation, explore new paths, and do everything possible to help enterprises promote products and develop new production areas. He believes that first, we need to rectify business ideas, change attitudes, promote production-sales linkage, adopt flexible and diverse methods to expand sales. For effective business methods such as material exchange, we should not eliminate them but protect and continuously improve them in implementation. Second, we need to provide good services for production enterprises, provide information, help enterprises reduce costs, improve quality, adjust prices, and open up sales channels. Especially for mechanical and electrical products, we need to support the technological transformation of old enterprises, producing technologically advanced, low-energy-consuming, and low raw material-consuming high-yield products. For products that are temporarily surplus but will still be in short supply, we need to use imports and exports to adjust. At the same time, while restricting the import of some equipment, we should actively organize exports. Additionally, some products also need to open up new consumption areas. For example, we can do more agricultural water conservancy construction and build more cement roads, which not only expands the cement sales channels but also improves agricultural production conditions and provides an outlet for surplus rural labor.

    保证供应  促进销售
    ——物资部部长柳随年谈一九九○年物资工作
    本报记者  王锦鹄
    1989年，我国物资供需形势出现了多年来少有的变化。年初，物资供应紧张，价格居高不下，库存下降；而进入三、四季度销售旺季后却一反常态，部分品种销售疲软，价格回落。从目前情况来看，一方面是一些重要物资供需矛盾得到缓解，另一方面是部分物资滞销积压，此中有喜亦有忧。
    这种局面将会持续多久？明年物资供需形势如何？带着这个问题，记者日前走访了物资部柳随年部长。
    “明年物资平衡有长有短，滞销与紧缺并存。”柳随年对1990年的物资供需形势作了这样的概括。他认为，随着贯彻十三届五中全会精神，进一步治理整顿，1990年基建投资规模将继续压缩，信贷规模和消费资金增长继续得到控制，多数物资的社会供需总量基本可以平衡，滞销现象还会存在，但有些品种仍然紧缺。
    柳随年刚参加完全国计划会议。这位部长预测，明年主要生产资料中，煤炭的供需矛盾会有所缓和，但优质煤特别是精洗煤中的主焦煤等仍紧缺；钢材总量基本平衡，但由于品种不对路，有些品种仍有缺口；有色金属、一部分化工原料产品依然紧缺。钢材中的线材、水泥、平板玻璃等一般建筑材料可能出现供过于求的情况；汽车中的小车、轻型车将继续滞销。从年底的产品订货会成交情况看，机电产品需求量1990年将大幅度下降。
    曾长期从事经济计划工作的柳随年从宏观经济的角度作了分析。他说：“多年来生产资料一直供不应求并非正常现象。目前某些物资滞销积压是相对的、暂时的，从总量上看还是供应不足。治理整顿以来，生产资料市场出现了相对缓和和宽松，这正是我们多年来所希望的。它为克服经济过热和通货膨胀，理顺经济关系，使国民经济走上良性循环创造了有利条件，也为我们实施国家产业政策，倾斜配置资源，调整产业结构提供了难得的机遇。我们应利用这个机会来调整产业结构、产品结构和进出口结构。”
    在谈到完成1990年的任务时，柳随年说：“一方面要请各级领导和舆论界支持流通部门的工作，另方面物资部门要振奋精神，努力工作，不仅要保证供应，更要促进销售，把两副担子都挑起来”。
    柳随年指出，保供就是要加强全局观念，严肃指令性计划。保证重点需要。首先保证农业生产所需物资和农田水利基本建设的“三材”，其次是安排能源、原材料生产、交通运输、重点建设项目所需计划物资；对国防军工、轻工市场紧缺产品、出口创汇产品、优质名牌产品、技术先进的产品所需物资优先供应，其他方面的分配数量将压减。
    为确保国家统配物资分配计划的落实，生产企业要按合同交货，在完成国家指令性计划的前提下才能自销。同时，要加强产销衔接，加强计划指导，划出一定数量的自销产品，实行定点定量不定价供应，以补大中型企业和重点建设项目之需。
    柳随年对记者说，物资部门促销经验不足，对部分物资出现滞销积压这一新情况缺乏应变能力。目前应当认真研究新的情况，探索新的路子，千方百计帮助企业推销产品和开拓新的生产领域。他认为，第一是要端正经营思想，改变作风，促进产销挂钩，采取灵活多样的方式，扩大销售。对物资串换等行之有效的经营方式，不能搞掉，而应加以保护，并在实施中不断完善。第二是要为生产企业搞好服务，提供信息，帮助企业降低成本，提高质量，调整价格，打开销路。特别是机电产品，要支持老企业技术改造，改产技术先进、能耗和原材料消耗低的高效益产品。对暂时多余以后仍然短缺的产品，要用进出口来调剂。同时，在限制一些设备进口的同时，积极组织出口。此外，有些产品也要开拓新的消费领域。如多搞一些农田水利建设，多修一些水泥马路，不仅可以扩大水泥销路，又可改善农业生产条件，并为农村剩余劳力找到出路。
