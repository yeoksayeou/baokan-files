Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing emphasized at the full army logistics work conference that all military personnel must recognize the situation, maintain their resolve, serve the national construction, and voluntarily share the nation's burdens, leading the way in living frugally for a few years.

Liu Huaqing said, the current situation in our country is good. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, some people were concerned that our country's social, political, and economic situations might become unstable. However, this did not happen, and with a series of measures taken by the Party and the state, our country's political situation is becoming increasingly stable, and people's thoughts and awareness are increasingly converging. The economic rectification and adjustment have achieved initial results, and the national economy has begun to move in a positive direction. We should have firm confidence in the development of the domestic situation. We must fully see our country's bright future, see the bright future of socialism, firmly hold onto the Marxist ideal and belief, and use these to continuously inspire our fighting spirit and dedication. We must, with practical work, promote national stability, especially maintain the high degree of concentration and unity of the military. This is crucial for the nation's security and the fundamental interests of the people.

Liu Huaqing said, Comrade Mao Zedong once said that people must have some spirit. In the current situation, it is necessary to focus on solving people's material interests, but first, we should focus on solving the problem of spiritual support. As long as we correctly recognize the current situation, fully recognize the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, and unshakably move forward on the path indicated by the Party Central Committee, unite and struggle, and dedicate ourselves selflessly, we will definitely overcome the difficulties and achieve our grand goals and ideals.

Liu Huaqing said, "Decide to live frugally for a few years," this is the Party's call. Our military is the people's army. When the country faces difficulties, we should voluntarily share the nation's burdens and lead the way in living frugally. He said, what we mean by living frugally is to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and frugal military building. What we mean by living frugally is to eliminate all waste and prevent excessive consumption. What we mean by living frugally is not living in hardship. For some issues in the lives of cadres and soldiers, we should still try our best to solve them.

Liu Huaqing said, living frugally is a common task for the entire military, requiring the joint efforts of all military personnel. First of all, leaders at all levels must set an example and serve as a model for the troops. The logistics system, as a department responsible for household management and finance, has a heavy responsibility. He said, strictly implementing financial and economic systems and disciplines is the institutional guarantee for living frugally, and it is also an important aspect of maintaining the military's high degree of concentration and unity. Party committees and all departments at all levels must take this issue seriously, from the perspective of the overall situation of the Party and the military, and handle this issue responsibly. We must not only consider the interests of our own units and local areas, and arbitrarily interpret policies, systems, and regulations.

The seven-day full army logistics work conference concluded today. The conference thoroughly implemented the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, closely focusing on the theme of how to continue living frugally, analyzed the situation of the military's logistics work in 1989, and studied the tasks for the military's logistics work in the coming year. General Logistics Department Director Zhao Nanqi gave a report titled "Strengthen Management, Live Frugally, and Ensure the Army's Combat Effectiveness." General Logistics Department Political Commissar Liu Anyuan also spoke at the conference.

During the conference, military commission leaders Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Yang Baibing, and Qin Jiwei met with the attendees. Central Military Commission members Hong Xuezhi and Chi Haotian attended the conference and spoke.

    刘华清在全军后勤工作会议上强调
    军队服从国家建设大局
    坚定信念过几年紧日子
    新华社北京12月19日电（记者郭殿成）中央军委副主席刘华清在全军后勤工作会议上强调，全军指战员要认清形势，坚定信念，服从国家建设大局，自觉地为党为国分忧，带头过好紧日子。
    刘华清说，当前，我国的形势是好的。平息反革命暴乱后，一些人曾经担心我国社会政治经济可能出现不稳。但是，这种情况并没有出现，而且随着党和国家采取的一系列措施，我国的政局日益稳定，人们的思想认识越来越趋向一致。治理整顿经济，取得了初步成效，整个国民经济开始朝着良性循环的方向运行。对国内形势的发展，我们应当有坚定的信心。要充分看到我们国家的光明前途，看到社会主义的光明前途，坚定马克思主义的理想和信念，并用这些不断激发我们的奋斗精神和献身精神。我们要以切实的工作，促进国家的稳定，特别要保持军队的高度集中统一。这是国家安危和人民根本利益所在。
    刘华清说，毛泽东同志讲过，人总是要有一点精神的。就当前情况来讲，重视解决人们的物质利益是必要的，但首先应该重视解决精神支柱问题。只要我们正确认识当前形势，充分认识克服困难的有利条件，坚定不移地朝着党中央指引的道路前进，团结奋斗，无私奉献，就一定能战胜困难，实现我们的宏伟目标和理想。
    刘华清说，“下决心过几年紧日子”，这是党的号召。我们军队是人民子弟兵，在国家面临困难的时候，应当自觉地为党为国分忧，带头过好紧日子。他说，我们说的过紧日子，就是要发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建军的优良传统。我们说的过紧日子，就是要扫除一切铺张浪费，防止超前消费。我们说过紧日子，不是过苦日子，对干部战士生活中的一些问题，我们仍然应当尽力给予解决。
    刘华清说，过好紧日子，是全军共同的任务，需要全军同志共同努力。首先是各级领导要以身作则，为部队作出表率。后勤系统作为管家理财的职能部门，更是责任重大。他说，严格执行财经制度和财经纪律是过好紧日子的制度保证，也是保持全军高度集中统一的一个重要方面。各级党委和各个部门都要以严肃的态度，从全党全军的大局出发，认真对待这个问题。决不能只考虑本单位和局部的利益，对政策、制度和规定，各取所需，各行其是。
    历时7天的全军后勤工作会议今天结束。会议认真贯彻党的十三届五中全会和军委扩大会议精神，紧紧围绕如何继续过好紧日子这个主题，分析了1989年全军后勤工作形势，研究了明年的全军后勤工作任务。总后勤部长赵南起在会上作了《加强管理，过好紧日子，保障部队提高战斗力》的报告。总后勤部政委刘安元也在会议上发了言。
    会议期间，江泽民、杨尚昆、杨白冰、秦基伟等军委领导人会见了与会同志；中央军委委员洪学智、迟浩田出席会议，并讲了话。
