The 44th United Nations General Assembly, after discussing over 140 agenda items, temporarily adjourned today at the UN headquarters. The session, which lasted over three months, adopted 239 resolutions, expressing the urgent desire of the international community, especially the broad developing countries, to maintain peace and seek development.

The peaceful resolution of regional conflicts, especially, attracted widespread attention. Building on the achievements of last year, progress has been made. Notably, UN member states universally supported and promoted the process of Namibian independence.

The assembly also passed a resolution with an unprecedented overwhelming majority of 124 votes, demanding that Vietnamese troops withdraw under UN supervision. This exposed Vietnam's false withdrawal tactics, indicating that a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue is the trend and the will of the people.

The General Assembly passed 59 resolutions related to disarmament, accounting for 1/4 of the total resolutions, showing that disarmament remains a priority issue for the international community. Among them, China's proposals on "nuclear disarmament" and "conventional disarmament" were unanimously adopted by the assembly. This is particularly significant under the current circumstances, indicating that China's proposals reflect the common aspirations of the international community and also demonstrate China's important international status.

The General Assembly also passed 48 economic-related resolutions, covering issues such as external debt, primary commodity prices, and the flow of funds from developing countries to developed countries, expressing the demand of the broad developing countries to establish a new world economic order.

	Developing countries also achieved several victories in opposing some Western countries' use of "human rights" as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

	In the early hours of December 20, the United States invaded Panama by force. In the past few days, the Security Council has been reviewing this issue.

    第44届联大暂时休会
    发展中国家要求维护和平与发展
    本报联合国12月22日电  记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会在审议了预定的140多项议程后，今天在联合国大厦暂时休会。这次大会历时3月有余，通过了239项决议，表达了国际社会，特别是广大发展中国家维护和平、谋求发展的迫切愿望。
    和平解决地区冲突问题，特别为各方所关注。在巩固去年成果的基础上有所进展。突出的是联合国成员国普遍支持和推动纳米比亚的独立进程。
    大会还以124票的空前压倒多数通过决议，要求越南军队在联合国监督下真正撤军。这粉碎了越南假撤军的花招，表明全面政治解决柬埔寨问题是大势所趋、人心所向。
    联大通过有关裁军的决议共59项，占决议总数的1／4，显示裁军问题仍是国际社会优先关注的问题。其中，中国提出的“核裁军”和“常规裁军”提案获大会一致通过。这在目前形势下是难能可贵的，表明中国的提案表达了国际社会的共同愿望，也显示了中国的重要国际地位。
    联大还通过有关经济方面的决议共48项，涉及外债、初级商品价格、发展中国家资金向发达国家倒流等问题，表达了广大发展中国家建立世界经济新秩序的要求。
  　发展中国家在反对一些西方国家借口“人权”干涉别国内政方面，也取得几个胜利。
    美国在20日凌晨武装入侵巴拿马后，这几天，安理会在审议此问题。
