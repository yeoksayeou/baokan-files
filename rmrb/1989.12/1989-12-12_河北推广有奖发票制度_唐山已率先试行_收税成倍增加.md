A type of customer purchase invoice with rewards, which relies on public supervision, individual taxpayers' compliance with the law, and convenience for the tax authorities to plug tax evasion loopholes, has begun to be promoted across Hebei Province's tax system.

The method for customer purchase invoices with rewards is as follows: Individual businesses must issue invoices for transactions of 1 yuan or more; customers should keep these invoices for prize redemption. Each set of 100,000 invoices constitutes a group. Each group has one first prize, with a prize amount of 100 times the purchase amount on the invoice, but not exceeding 2,000 yuan; ten second prizes, with a prize amount of 10 times the purchase amount, but not exceeding 200 yuan; one hundred third prizes, with a prize amount of twice the purchase amount, but not exceeding 20 yuan; and one thousand fourth prizes, each with a prize of 2 yuan. After a group of invoices is used up, the tax authorities will organize a lottery, with the prizes certified by a notary public and paid to the customers by the tax authorities.

Additionally, this system stipulates that individual businesses that fail to issue invoices will be fined up to 5,000 yuan depending on the severity of the offense; informants will be rewarded.

The rewarding invoice system was first implemented by the Tangshan Municipal Tax Bureau in June of this year. After implementing this method, individual tax revenues have increased month by month, with an average increase of 155% per household in June and 162% in October. Among these, the aquaculture and processed meat products industries saw an average tax increase of 215% per household.

    河北推广有奖发票制度
    唐山已率先试行　收税成倍增加
    韩日朝　田书存
    一种依靠群众监督、个体纳税户遵法使用、便于税务部门堵塞偷税漏洞的顾客购货有奖发票，已开始在河北全省税务系统推广。
    顾客购货有奖发票的办法是：个体户每成交1元以上的交易，必须给顾客开具发票；顾客妥善保管，以备兑奖。有奖发票每10万张为1组。每组设一等奖1个，奖金为发票购货金额的100倍，但最高不超过2000元；二等奖10个，奖金为购货金额的10倍，最高不超过200元；三等奖100个，奖金为购货金额的2倍，最高不超过20元；四等奖1000个，奖金一律2元。每组发票用完后，税务部门组织摇奖，并由公证部门公证，奖金由税务机关付给顾客。
    此外，这项制度还规定了对违章不开发票的个体户，视情节轻重处5000元以下罚款；对监督举报人给予奖励。
    有奖发票制度是由唐山市税务局在今年6月首先试行的。试行此法后，个体税收逐月增长，6月份征收税款每户平均增长155％，10月份增长162％，其中水产、熟肉制品两个行业每户平均税额增长215％。（原载《市场报》）
