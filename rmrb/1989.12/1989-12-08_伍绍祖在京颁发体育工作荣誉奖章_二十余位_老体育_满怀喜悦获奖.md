Today morning, a group of veteran sports workers who have made significant contributions to the establishment of China's sports industry received their awards with great joy from Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, at the State Sports Commission Hall. They received their certificates of honor and wore the shiny gold medals.

The first batch of recipients of the State Sports Commission's Sports Work Honor Medal includes: Ma Qiuwei, Wang Ling, Tian Baolin, Liu Guiyi, Mou Zuoyun, Du Qian, Shen Jialin, Li Xiaosheng, Li Wei, Ji Mingzhao, Zhang Zhihuai, Zhang Qingji, Zhang Lianhua, Zhang Shuwu, Ke Li, Zhong Shitong, Zhao Bin, Guo Yan, Cao Sihui, Han Fudong, Lu Ting, Zeng Xianyue, and Wei Zhanlan. Additionally, the late former director of the Guangdong Provincial Sports Commission, Chen Yuangao, is also among the honorees. Most of the award recipients are retired officials from the State Sports Commission, local and military sports commissions, as well as veteran sports experts.

The recently established Sports Work Honor Medal, similar to the Sports Achievement Honor Medal established in 1959, is the highest honor in Chinese sports. The difference is that the former is mainly awarded to officials and experts, while the latter is mainly awarded to athletes and coaches.
