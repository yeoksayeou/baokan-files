Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 6th

Japan's economy has once again shown signs of high growth. The Economic Planning Agency of Japan released a statistical report today indicating that the real growth rate of the Japanese economy from July to September was 2.9% higher than the previous period, equivalent to an annual rate of 12.2%.

According to Kyodo News, after the implementation of the consumption tax in April this year, Japan's economy experienced a negative growth of 0.8% in the April to June period. Now, the economy has turned towards high growth again. The Economic Planning Agency believes that even if the economic growth rate for the October to December period and the January to March period of next year is zero, the real economic growth rate for the entire fiscal year 1989 (April 1989 to March 1990) will still reach the government's initial estimate of 4%. If the economic growth rates for the next two periods are both 1%, the annual economic growth rate will reach around 4.7% to 5%.

The Japanese economic sector generally believes that due to the simultaneous increase in equipment investment and personal consumption, the Japanese economy will continue to maintain a good development momentum in the future.

    日本经济再次出现高增长势头
    新华社东京12月6日电  日本经济企划厅今天发表的统计报告表明，7至9月日本经济实际增长率比前期提高2.9％，换算成年率高达12.2％。
    据共同社报道，日本经济自今年4月实施消费税以后，4至6月曾一度出现0.8％的负增长，如今日本经济再度转向高增长。日本经济企划厅认为，即使10至12月和明年1至3月两期日本经济增长为零，整个1989年度（1989年4月至1990年3月）经济实际增长率也将达到政府当初估算的4％的水平。若下两期经济增长率分别为1％，全年度经济增长率将高达4.7％乃至5％左右。
    日本经济界普遍认为，由于设备投资与个人消费两旺，日本经济今后将继续保持良好的发展势头。
