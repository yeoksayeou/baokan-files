The First Automobile Works Cultural Troupe in Changchun is a long-standing amateur arts group that has been active at the grassroots level. Over the past 30 years, they have performed on stage with singing and dancing (Image 1), and when they wear work clothes, they can work in the factory (Image 2). They have resisted the "yellow tide," insisted on positive propaganda, and performed healthy programs (Image 3). They adhere to the "three no's" policy: no car pick-up, no souvenirs, and no meals, which has been warmly welcomed by the workers (Image 4). Recently, they participated in the "Voice of Machinery and Electronics" arts performance in Beijing (Images 5, 6) and won the championship, as well as 14 individual first prizes.

    车城文艺多采
    长春一汽工人艺术团，是一支长年活跃在基层的业余文艺轻骑。30多年来，他们登上舞台能歌舞（图1），穿上工装能做工（图2）；他们抵制“黄潮”，坚持正面宣传，自编自演健康节目（图3）；坚持不要车接送，不要纪念品，不要吃喝的“三不要”演出，受到工人群众的热烈欢迎（图4）。最近，他们赴京参加“机电之声”文艺调演的节目（图5、6），一举夺魁，还获得了14个单项一等奖。鲁乙酉摄
