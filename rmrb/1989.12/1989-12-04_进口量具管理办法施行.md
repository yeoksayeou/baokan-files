People's Daily, Beijing, December 3rd.

To strengthen the supervision and management of imported measuring instruments, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision has issued the "Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Imported Measuring Instruments of the People's Republic of China," which was approved by the State Council and recently promulgated by Xu Zhijian, Director of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision.

These measures were formulated in accordance with relevant provisions of the "Measurement Law" and its implementation rules, specifying the supervision and management procedures for the type approval, examination and approval, and inspection of imported measuring instruments.

Imported measuring instruments are substantial in quantity and high in value. According to incomplete statistics, China imported dozens of types of measuring instruments in just 1985 and 1986, with a total value of 370 million US dollars. According to the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, some countries do not yet have relevant laws and regulations, and the quality of their measuring instruments is relatively poor. The implementation of this management measure will help China to introduce advanced foreign measurement technology while preventing the influx of illegal and substandard measuring instruments.

    进口量具管理办法施行
    本报北京12月3日讯　记者朱剑红报道：为强化进口计量器具的监督管理，经国务院批准，《中华人民共和国进口计量器具监督管理办法》近日已由国家技术监督局局长徐志坚发布命令施行。
    这个办法是根据《计量法》及其实施细则的有关规定制定的，使进口计量器具的型式批准、审批及检定的监督管理办法具体化。
    进口计量器具量大价高，据不完全统计，仅1985、1986两年，我国就进口几十种计量器具，价值3.7亿美元。据国家技术监督局介绍，一些国家还没有这方面的法律规定，所产计量器具的质量较差。我国施行这项管理办法有利于在引进国外先进计量技术的同时，防止非法的、低劣的计量器具流入。
