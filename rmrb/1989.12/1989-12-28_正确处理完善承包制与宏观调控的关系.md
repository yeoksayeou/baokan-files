There are two main opposing views on the relationship between the contract responsibility system and fiscal revenue growth in society today. One view holds that the contract responsibility system ensures stable growth in fiscal revenue. The rationale is that the contract targets are set on a certain basis with incremental increases or fixed base numbers with profit-sharing, and the mechanism itself guarantees that fiscal revenue will only increase and not decrease. The other view argues that "fixed base numbers" and the practice of profit-sharing without loss-sharing effectively tie up fiscal revenue. Most of the new profits are retained by enterprises, and the proportion of profits handed over to the fiscal authorities has been decreasing year by year.

In response to these two views, we have done three calculations.

The first calculation is whether fiscal revenue has been stable since the implementation of the contract responsibility system. Since 1986, various industries have successively and widely implemented the contract responsibility system. Data shows that from 1986 to 1988, the total national fiscal revenue was 721.7 billion yuan, an increase of 260 billion yuan compared to the 461.7 billion yuan from 1983 to 1985, a growth of 56.3%, with an average annual growth rate of 11.6%. At this rate, it would not take six years for fiscal revenue to double. It can be said that the growth rate of fiscal revenue is not low. In the nearly three years since the implementation of the contract responsibility system, national fiscal revenue has been stable. Of course, compared to the growth rate of production, the growth rate is still relatively low.

The second calculation is how much industry contributes to fiscal revenue. Industry is the main source of fiscal revenue, and the main forms of industry's contributions to fiscal revenue are taxes and profits, which can be interchanged. In recent years, with the adjustment of tax rates, part of the profits has been converted into taxes. Taxes are fully handed over to fiscal revenue, while profits have a three-way distribution issue. Therefore, the measure of industry's contribution to fiscal revenue should be the sum of profits and taxes handed over to fiscal revenue. From 1986 to 1988, despite significant price increases in raw materials, rising transportation and loan interest rates, and various fees and levies, the total amount of profits and taxes handed over to fiscal revenue by more than 70,000 state-owned industrial enterprises with independent accounting was still 364.3 billion yuan, an increase of 78.5 billion yuan compared to the three years before the contract responsibility system, a growth of 27.5%, with an average annual growth rate of 8.4%. It can be said that the part handed over to fiscal revenue by industry is increasing year by year (Note: The above calculation does not include the education surcharge and cigarette price increase income before achieving profits, nor does it include the energy and transportation construction fund, budget adjustment fund, national treasury bonds, and key construction bonds after achieving profits).

Of course, looking at the distribution of profits achieved by enterprises, it is a fact that the part handed over to fiscal revenue (corporate income tax, adjustment tax, profits, two items of occupation fees, contract fees) has not increased. The profits achieved in 1986, 1987, and 1988 were 77 billion, 84.8 billion, and 97.3 billion yuan respectively, and the part handed over to fiscal revenue was 48.4 billion, 47.8 billion, and 41.8 billion yuan respectively, with no increase each year and even a decrease. At the same time, the nominal retained profits of enterprises (after deducting the energy and transportation construction fund and various bonds) were 22.8 billion, 26.5 billion, and 32.3 billion yuan respectively, with a significant increase each year. There are normal and abnormal reasons for the decrease in profits handed over by enterprises. The normal reason is that since the late 1970s, the policy has gradually expanded the financial authority of enterprises, reducing the proportion handed over to fiscal revenue. After the expansion of enterprise authority, investment mainly relies on bank loans and enterprise self-raising funds, using new profits to repay loans before tax. In this way, the distribution of profits achieved by enterprises has changed from two parts to three parts: one part to repay bank loans, one part to fiscal revenue, and one part retained by the enterprise. Therefore, the decrease in the proportion of profits handed over to fiscal revenue is understandable. The abnormal aspects of the decrease in profits handed over include excessive pre-tax repayment, reducing the profits that should be handed over to fiscal revenue; the proportion of profit-sharing by profitable enterprises is inappropriate, with some enterprises retaining too much; and the phenomenon of profit-sharing without loss-sharing indeed exists, with enterprises that fail to complete contract tasks often emphasizing the deterioration of external environment, and fiscal authorities having to reduce the handed-over tasks.

The third calculation is that in the past three years, due to price increases, the problem of fiscal revenue being overstated is indeed serious. From 1986 to 1988, although the profits and taxes handed over to fiscal revenue by state-owned industrial enterprises with independent accounting increased by an average of 8.4% per year, after deducting the three-year average increase of 10.5% in the retail price index, the actual growth was negative, and the proportion handed over to fiscal revenue was significantly lower compared to the growth rate of workers' income and enterprise retained profits (if education surcharges, cigarette price increase income, energy and transportation construction fund, national treasury bonds, and other bonds are added, the actual amount handed over is even higher).

How to help fiscal revenue out of the predicament? We believe: first, it is reasonable for contracted enterprises to share the country's burdens. Enterprises with unreasonable contract bases should be adjusted, mainly by appropriately increasing the base for enterprises with low contract bases. The determination of the handed-over proportion should consider whether the enterprise can be activated, whether it is conducive to enterprise renewal, technological progress, and the enhancement of the enterprise's self-accumulation and self-development capabilities, and whether it is conducive to the fiscal authorities' ability to bear. It should be adjusted comprehensively from both aspects. Second, it is necessary to thoroughly rectify and regulate the chaos in the circulation field and strengthen the investigation and punishment of tax evasion.

The correct handling of the concentration and decentralization of financial power is the key to handling the relationship between the central and local governments, macro and micro levels.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, on the basis of expanding enterprise autonomy, various forms of contract responsibility systems have been implemented. With the gradual decentralization of central financial power, extra-budgetary funds have rapidly expanded, reaching 227 billion yuan by the end of 1988. The ratio of extra-budgetary funds to budgetary funds has decreased from 1:1.87 in 1980 to 1:1.09 in 1988, with extra-budgetary funds increasing by four times in eight years. Due to the expansion of extra-budgetary funds and the diversification of interest subjects after contracting, local governments and enterprises are always willing to invest in processing industries with low investment and high profits, while the development of energy and raw material industries, which are urgently needed by the state, is slow, exacerbating the difficulty of adjusting the industrial structure. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the appropriate concentration of financial resources at present. Financial resources can be concentrated from the following two aspects:

First, more funds should be concentrated from the "separate kitchen" of central and local governments. This will not affect the enthusiasm of enterprises, and local financial resources also have a certain bearing capacity.

Second, strengthen price management. Whether it is consumer goods or producer goods, a considerable part of the net income from product price changes should belong to the central fiscal revenue. According to preliminary estimates, the price increase of industrial products at or above the township level in 1988 made enterprises earn an additional 198 billion yuan, while the price increase of raw materials made enterprises spend an additional 171.6 billion yuan. After deducting the expenses, the net income of industry was 26.4 billion yuan. It is possible for the central fiscal revenue to take a part of this. Like calculating value-added tax, the product price increase income can be deducted from the main raw material price increase expenditure to adjust the contract targets, which can increase the central fiscal revenue and curb the desire of enterprises to compete for price increases.

With the increase of enterprise retained profits, enterprise financial power is continuously expanding, and with the change of enterprise investment from fiscal allocation to bank loans and pre-tax repayment, enterprises basically do not bear the investment risk. The original value of fixed assets of national independent accounting industrial enterprises in 1988 was three times that of 1978 (excluding price factors), and 55% higher than that of 1985 before the widespread promotion of the contract responsibility system. The newly increased fixed assets have the positive effect of enhancing the enterprise's future strength and developing China's productive forces, but there are also many blind investments. The main reason for the out-of-control investment is the out-of-control credit, so to control the investment expansion, first, the state should do a good job in comprehensive balance, control the total scale of investment, and reduce bank construction and technological transformation investment loans. However, it is not appropriate to use a one-size-fits-all approach. A policy of both support and pressure should be adopted to facilitate the adjustment of the industrial structure and make the overall economy return to a virtuous cycle. Second, for enterprises implementing the contract responsibility system, construction and technological transformation loans should have a certain proportion of post-tax repayment. The amount of enterprise repayment is already about 20% of the profits achieved by the enterprise, almost eating up all the new profits of the enterprise, which is the main reason why the profits handed over to fiscal revenue cannot increase. If all pre-tax repayment is implemented, it will not be conducive to the concentration of fiscal revenue and will affect the balance of fiscal revenue for the year. If all post-tax repayment is implemented, enterprises currently cannot bear it, which will also affect the future development of enterprises. Whether it is old loans or new loans, they should bear a part of the repayment according to their repayment ability, both pre-tax and post-tax, to help each other through difficulties. Enterprises can accept this, and fiscal revenue can also increase a part of the income.

The deeper reason for investment expansion is the guiding ideology of seeking quick results in economic construction. In the future, when adjusting the relationship between the central and local governments, it is necessary to study the standardization of the use of financial power by local governments and enterprises, and the direction of fund investment should be subject to the overall industrial policy requirements of the state.

The expansion of consumption funds mainly comes from two aspects of pressure, one is the rapid growth of social group (including enterprise) consumption, which must be controlled. The other is the rapid growth of personal consumption, which must also be curbed.

The expansion of personal consumption funds has both the reasons of the imperfection of the contract responsibility system and the reasons outside the contract responsibility system. The contract responsibility system gives the contractor the power to issue wages and bonuses, but in specific methods, it lacks necessary restraint mechanisms, which can easily lead to some contracted enterprises issuing too many wages and bonuses. The external reasons are that in the past two years, market prices have increased by double digits every year. Whether it is a contracted enterprise or a non-contracted enterprise, in order to stabilize the emotions of employees and mobilize their production enthusiasm, it is necessary to issue bonuses every year. In recent years, the state has also expanded the standard for exempting bonus tax from two and a half months of the standard wage of employees per year to four and a half months. Internal and external factors have promoted the expansion of consumption funds. While social distribution is unfair and there is mutual comparison, it is another reason for the expansion of consumption funds. At present, it is necessary to adjust through the method of levying individual income tax to correct the problem of unfair distribution.

At present, while improving the contract responsibility system, it is necessary to explore new ideas for national economic management. All reform measures should be tested through pilot projects. On the basis of a large number of pilot projects, the successful reform measures should be seriously summarized and promoted, so that the reform can be gradually deepened.

    正确处理完善承包制与宏观调控的关系
    赵岷山　杨宽宽　沈智宏　刘玉琪　周学文
    一、承包制与财政收入增长的关系
    当前社会上主要有两种截然不同的意见。一种意见认为，承包制确保了财政收入的稳定增长。其理由是承包指标是在一定基础上环比递增或包死基数超收分成，机制本身就保证了财政收入只增不减。另一种意见认为，“包死基数”和执行中的包盈不包亏，实际上把财政包死了。新增利润的绝大部分留给了企业，上交财政的比重逐年下降。
    针对这两种意见，我们算了三笔帐。
    第一笔帐是，实行承包制以来，财政收入是否稳定增长？从1986年开始，各行各业先后普遍推行了承包经营责任制。资料表明，1986到1988三年内，全国财政收入共计7217亿元，比大面积推广承包制前的1983到1985三年的全国财政收入4617亿元增加2600亿元，增长56.3％，平均每年递增11.6％。按照这个速度，毋须六年，财政收入就能翻一番。应该说这样的财政收入增幅不算低。推行承包制的近三年，全国财政收入是稳定增长的。当然，它与生产增长幅度相比，增幅依然偏低。
    第二笔帐是，工业对财政的贡献如何？工业是财政收入的主要来源，工业部门上交财政的主要形式，一是税，二是利，这两者是可以互相转换的。近几年，随着税率的调整，一部分利润转化为税金。税金全部上交财政，利润部分才有个三者分配问题。因此，衡量工业对财政的贡献，应是上交财政的利、税之和。1986到1988三年内，在原材料大幅度涨价，运费、贷款利率不断提高，各种费用、集资摊派繁多，工业巨额利润转移到工业领域之外的情况下，全国7万多个全民所有制独立核算工业企业，累计上交财政的利税总额仍达3643亿元，比承包前的三年增加了785亿元，增长27.5％，平均每年递增8.4％。应该说工业上交财政的部分是逐年增长的（注：上述计算未包括在实现利润前开征的教育费附加、卷烟提价收入等，也未包括实现利润后交纳的能源交通建设基金、预算调节基金、国库券、重点建设债券等）。
    当然，单就企业实现利润的分配看，上交财政的部分（所得税、调节税、利润、两项占用费、承包费）没有增长也是事实。1986、1987和1988三年的实现利润分别为770、848和973亿元，上交财政部分为484、478和418亿元，每年不仅没有增长，反而有所下降。而同时期企业名义留利额（未扣除能源交通建设基金及各种债券等）分别为228、265和323亿元，每年都有较大幅度的增长。企业上交利润减少有正常和非正常两个方面原因。正常的是从70年代末开始，在政策上逐步给企业扩大财权，减少了上交财政的比例。企业扩权后，投资主要靠银行贷款和企业自筹，用新增利润税前还贷。这样，企业实现利润的分配就从一分为二变为一分为三：一块归还银行贷款，一块上交财政，一块留给企业。因此，上交财政的利润占实现利润的比重下降是不足为怪的。上交利润减少的不正常方面，一是税前还贷过多，冲减了应上交财政的利润；二是盈利企业超收分成的比例不当，有的企业留利偏多；三是包盈不包亏的现象确实存在，完不成承包任务的企业往往过多地强调外部环境恶化，财政不得不减免上交任务。
    第三笔帐是，近三年来由于物价上涨，财政虚收的问题确实严重存在。1986年到1988年，虽然全民独立核算工业上交财政利税平均每年增长8.4％，如扣除零售物价总指数三年平均上涨10.5％后，实际为负增长，相对职工收入和企业留利的增长幅度而言，上交财政数明显偏低（如加上教育费附加、卷烟提价收入、能交基金、国库券及其它债券等，实际上交数还要高一些）。
    如何使财政摆脱困境？我们认为：第一，承包企业为国家分忧理所当然。承包基数不合理的应予调整，主要是承包基数偏低的企业应适当调高基数。上交比例的确定，一要考虑企业能否搞活，有利于企业更新改造和技术进步，增强企业自我积累、自我发展的能力，二要考虑财政的承受能力。应该综合两方面的情况加以调整。第二，必须彻底治理整顿流通领域的混乱现象，抓紧抓好对偷漏税的查处工作。
    二、财权集中与分散的关系
    正确处理财权集中与分散，是处理好中央与地方、宏观与微观关系的关键。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，在扩大企业自主权的基础上，推行了多种形式的经营承包责任制，随着中央财权的逐步下放，预算外的资金迅速膨胀，1988年底达到了2270亿元，预算外资金与预算内资金之比，从1980年的1∶1.87缩小到1988年的1∶1.09，八年内预算外资金的绝对额增加了4倍。由于预算外资金膨胀，加上承包后利益主体的多元化，地方和企业总是愿意把资金投向耗资少、盈利多的一些加工工业，而国家急需的能源和原材料工业发展缓慢，加剧了调整工业结构的困难。因此，当前强调适当集中财力，是必要的。集中财力，可从以下两方面着手：
    （一）要从中央、地方财政“分灶吃饭”中多集中一部分。这既不会影响企业的积极性，地方财力也有一定的承受能力。
    （二）加强价格管理。无论生活资料还是生产资料，产品价格变动的净收入，相当一部分应归中央财政。据初步匡算，1988年全国乡以上工业产品涨价使企业多收1980亿元，原材料涨价使企业多支1716亿元，收支相抵后，工业净收益264亿元。中央财政从中拿一部分是可能的。像计算增值税一样，将产品涨价收入扣除主要原材料涨价增支额，来调整承包指标，既可增加中央财政收入，又能抑制企业产品竞相提价的欲望。
    三、企业承包制与投资膨胀的关系
    随着企业留利的增加，企业财权不断扩大，再加上企业投资由财政拨款改为向银行贷款，税前还贷，企业基本上不承担投资风险。全国独立核算工业企业的固定资产原值，1988年是1978年的三倍（未扣除价格因素），比大面积推广承包前的1985年增加55％。新增的固定资产，有增强企业后劲，发展我国生产力的积极作用，但其中盲目性的投资也不少。投资失控主要来自信贷失控，所以要控制住投资膨胀，首先，国家要搞好综合平衡，控制投资总规模、压缩银行基建和技改投资贷款。但也不能一刀切，应采取有保有压的政策，以利于产业结构的调整，使总体经济走上良性循环的轨道。其次，实行承包制的企业，基建、技改贷款应有一定比例税后还贷。企业还贷数量之大，已经占到企业实现利润的20％左右，几乎吃掉了企业全部新增利润，是上交财政利润不能增长的主要原因。如果全部税前还贷，不利于财政集中，必将影响当年财政的平衡。如果全部税后还贷，目前企业还承受不了，也会影响企业的发展后劲。无论老贷款还是新贷款，都应视其还款能力，税前、税后各负担一部分，共度难关，企业是可以接受的，财政也能由此增加一部分收入。
    投资膨胀更为深层的原因是经济建设中急于求成的指导思想，今后在调整中央与地方的关系时，应研究使地方和企业使用财权的规范化，资金的投向要服从国家整个产业政策的要求。
    四、企业承包制与消费基金膨胀的关系
    消费基金膨胀主要来自两方面的压力，一是社会集团（包括企业）消费增长过快，必须控制。二是个人消费增长过快的势头，也必须抑制。
    个人消费基金膨胀，有承包制不完善的原因，也有承包制以外的原因。承包制赋予了承包者增发工资和奖金的权力，而在具体办法上又缺少必要的约束机制，容易导致某些承包企业过多地增发工资和奖金。究其外部原因，近二年市场物价每年以两位数递增，无论是承包企业还是非承包企业，为了安定职工情绪，调动其生产积极性，不得不逐年增发奖金。近年来，国家对免征奖金税的标准也从每年不超过二个半月的职工标准工资扩大到四个半月。内因和外因推动了消费基金的膨胀。而社会分配不公，互相攀比，则是消费基金膨胀的另一原因。目前，应通过征收个人所得税的办法来加以调节，以纠正分配不公的问题。
    目前，在完善承包制的同时，应该探索国家经济管理的新思路，一切改革措施都应经过试点，在大量试点的基础上，认真总结，证明确属成功的改革措施，再加以推广，才能将改革逐步引向深入。
