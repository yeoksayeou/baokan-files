The year 1989 saw a relatively stable situation on the Korean Peninsula and a revival of North-South dialogue. To seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, the North and South engaged in multi-level contacts and dialogues on easing political and military confrontations, discussing a non-aggression declaration, achieving cooperation and exchanges in various fields, and resolving issues such as the reunion of separated families. Some progress has been made.

At the beginning of the new year, Chairman Kim Il-sung, in his New Year's address, extended an invitation to the leaders of the four major parties and prominent figures in South Korea, proposing to hold a North-South political consultation meeting to discuss a plan for Korean unification through a federal system. However, this did not receive a response from the South Korean authorities. Moreover, due to South Korea's insistence on holding the "Cooperation Spirit 89" joint military exercises with the United States, the ongoing or upcoming vice-ministerial-level talks, preliminary parliamentary consultations, and sports talks between the North and South were either postponed or failed to reach any results. The initial visit of prominent South Korean business figure Jeong Joo-young to Pyongyang ended without further developments.

Soon after, South Korean pastor Mun Yeong-hwan visited the North, and representative Im Su-gyeong of the "Minjung Party" went to Pyongyang to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival, where they discussed unification plans with relevant officials in the North. However, their actions were deemed "illegal" by the South Korean authorities, and they remain detained to this day. This cast a new shadow over North-South relations. Entering the second half of the year, with the North's efforts, the vice-ministerial-level talks and sports talks resumed, and the parliamentary consultations, which had been suspended for ten months, and the Red Cross talks, which had been suspended for four years, also resumed. So far, the two sides have held nearly twenty rounds of contacts and talks at four levels and have reached agreements on some issues.

This situation has not occurred since 1985. Notably, in the parliamentary consultations, the two sides agreed to include the discussion of a "non-aggression declaration" in the parliamentary talks agenda. This indicates that the two sides have at least formally begun to ease military confrontations. In the vice-ministerial-level talks, agreements were reached on some issues related to the prime ministerial-level talks. In the sports sector, the two sides reached multiple agreements on forming a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games held in Beijing. The easing of the situation on the Korean Peninsula is widely welcomed. However, it should be noted that the current contacts and dialogues between the North and South have not yet achieved breakthrough results. The reason for this is, first, the United States has not abandoned its policy of interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean Peninsula. It not only refuses to withdraw its troops and military equipment from South Korea but also attempts to isolate North Korea internationally. Second, the South Korean authorities have not abandoned their intention to create "two Koreas" and even seek to "join the United Nations separately." Roh Tae-woo's proposal for a "Korean Community Unification Plan" attempts to impose the existing South Korean system on the North. In response, Chairman Kim Il-sung clearly stated that Korea will adhere to the socialist path and reiterated that the Korean unification issue cannot be resolved by one side swallowing the other.

Local public opinion generally believes that to ensure the healthy development of North-South dialogue and the continued easing of the situation on the peninsula, external interference must first be eliminated, allowing the Korean people to independently and autonomously resolve their own issues.

### 朝南北对话趋活跃  半岛局势相对平稳

    朝南北对话趋活跃  半岛局势相对平稳
    本报记者  徐宝康
    一九八九年是朝鲜半岛局势相对平稳、北南对话重新活跃的一年。为谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，北南双方就缓和政治、军事对峙状态，商讨互不侵犯宣言，实现多方面合作与交流，以及解决离散家属团聚等问题，进行了多层次的接触和对话，并取得一定进展。
    新年伊始，金日成主席在《新年词》中，向南朝鲜朝野四党总裁及各界知名人士发出邀请，建议举行北南政治协商会议，共商以联邦制实现朝鲜统一的方案。但是，未能得到南朝鲜当局的响应。而且，由于南朝鲜方面坚持与美国举行“协作精神八九”联合军事演习，使得正在进行或即将举行的北南双方副部长级会谈、国会代表预备性会晤、体育会谈，不是推迟，就是谈不出结果。南方经济界著名人士郑周永年初首访平壤之后，不了了之。
    不久，南朝鲜文益焕牧师访问北方，“全大协”代表林秀卿到平壤参加第十三届世界青年联欢节，分别与北方有关方面人士共商统一大计。但是，他们的行动却被南朝鲜当局视为“违法”，至今仍被关押起来。这给北南关系投下了新的阴影。进入下半年以后，在北方的努力推动下，北南副部长级会谈、体育会谈相继恢复，中断十个月之久的国会代表预备性会晤和中断四年之久的红十字工作会谈也重新开始。截至目前为止，双方已在四个层次进行了近二十轮接触和会谈，并就一些问题达成了协议。
    这种情况是一九八五年以来未曾有过的。引人注目的是，国会代表预备性会晤中，双方就把商讨“互不侵犯宣言”问题列入国会会谈议题达成协议。这说明双方在消除军事对抗方面至少从形式上已开始有所松动。在双方副部长级会谈中，就总理级会谈的一些问题达成协议。在体育方面，双方就组成统一队参加在北京举行的第十一届亚运会问题也达成了多项协议。朝鲜半岛形势趋向缓和，受到人们普遍的欢迎。但也应当看到，目前北南双方的接触和对话，尚未能取得突破性的成果。其所以如此，一是美国至今没有放弃干涉朝鲜半岛的内部事务的政策。它不仅拒不撤走在南朝鲜的驻军和军事装备，而且企图在国际上孤立朝鲜北方。二是南朝鲜当局至今未放弃制造“两个朝鲜”的意图，甚至谋求“单独加入联合国”。卢泰愚抛出的“韩民族共同体统一方案”，竟然企图把南朝鲜现存制度强加于北方。对此，金日成主席明确指出，朝鲜坚持走社会主义道路，并重申朝鲜统一问题不能是一方吃掉另一方。
    此间舆论普遍认为，要使朝鲜北南对话健康发展，半岛局势继续走向缓和，首先必须排除外来干涉，让朝鲜人民独立自主地解决自己的问题。
