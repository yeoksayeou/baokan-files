The Great Wall computer Chinese processing system, independently designed and manufactured by China, has recently been officially put into use at the United Nations headquarters in New York and has been well received and praised by users.

The Great Wall computer Chinese processing system was jointly designed and manufactured by the Great Wall Computer Group of China and the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute. Because the system is compatible with the features of IBM computers from the United States, it can be connected to IBM mainframes to form a communication network.

Yan Meisheng, a responsible official of the Chinese section of the United Nations, recently told a reporter from this news agency that since the installation of this Chinese processing system, the efficiency of Chinese translation, typing, and other tasks handled by the section has greatly improved. She said that the system has the advantages of fast input speed, good Chinese editing functions, and large vocabulary storage capacity.

According to Yan Meisheng, the 16 Great Wall Chinese computers currently in official use at the United Nations also have a communication network system installed. This is the first local area network system at the United Nations. This network system connects the mainframe with the terminal and can be connected to the computer systems of relevant international organizations. Officials from relevant departments of the United Nations also expressed the hope that the United Nations' institutions in other parts of the world can also use this Chinese processing system as soon as possible.

    我长城电脑中文处理系统在联合国正式投入使用
    新华社联合国12月2日电  （记者雷力利）由中国自行设计、制造的长城电脑中文处理系统最近在联合国纽约总部正式投入使用，并受到用户的欢迎与好评。
    长城电脑中文处理系统是由中国长城计算机集团和上海印刷技术研究所联合设计制造的。由于该系统兼容了美国IBM公司计算机的特点，因此它可以与IBM计算机主机连接形成通讯网络。
    联合国中文处负责官员颜梅生最近对本社记者说，由于安装了这套中文处理系统，该处负责的中文翻译、打字等工作效率已大大提高。她说，这套系统具有输入速度快、中文编辑功能好、词汇储存功能大等特点。
    据颜梅生说，目前在联合国正式投入使用的16台长城中文电脑还同时试安装了通讯网络系统。这是联合国第一部本地网络系统。这套网络系统沟通了主机与终端机的连接，并可以与国际有关组织的电脑系统连接。联合国有关部门官员也表示，希望联合国在世界其它各地的机构也能尽快使用这种中文处理系统。
