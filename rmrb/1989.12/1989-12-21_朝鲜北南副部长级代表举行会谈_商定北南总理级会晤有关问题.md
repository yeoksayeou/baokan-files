North and South Korean Vice-Ministerial Level Representatives Hold Talks
Discuss Issues Related to Premier-Level Meeting

XU BAOKANG
PANMUNJOM, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- North and South Korean vice-ministerial level representatives held their fifth round of talks today at the "Peace House" on the South Korean side of Panmunjom. Both sides reached agreements on the name of the premier-level talks, the composition of the delegations, and the number of accompanying personnel. Both sides are optimistic about the progress of the talks.

During today's two-hour-long talks, the two sides reached three agreements: 1. The name of the premier-level talks will be "North-South High-Level Talks." 2. Each side's delegation will consist of 7 people, with the premier as the head. Each delegation must include at least one representative at the level of chief of the general staff, and the number of additional military representatives is to be determined by each side. 3. Each side's delegation will have 33 accompanying personnel.

Regarding the agenda for the premier-level talks, the two sides' views are close. The North proposed the agenda as: "Issues related to the elimination of political and military confrontation between the North and South and the realization of multi-faceted exchanges and cooperation between the North and South." The South, while agreeing to this agenda, suggested that "multi-faceted exchanges and cooperation between the North and South" should be placed before "the elimination of political and military confrontation between the North and South."

The remaining issues in the vice-ministerial level talks between North and South Korea are mainly the agenda for the talks and some technical issues.

Both sides agreed to hold the sixth round of talks on January 31, 1990, at the "Unification Pavilion" on the North Korean side of Panmunjom.

    朝鲜北南副部长级代表举行会谈
    商定北南总理级会晤有关问题
    本报板门店12月20日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜北南副部长级代表今天在板门店南方一侧的“和平之家”举行第5次会谈，双方就北南总理级会谈的名称、代表团组成以及随行人员的人数问题达成协议。双方对会谈进展持乐观态度。
    在今天的两个多小时会谈中，双方达成的3项协议是：1，北南总理级会谈的名称定为“北南高级会谈”。2，北方和南方的代表团各由7人组成，团长为各方总理。代表团中至少要有1名总参谋长级代表，是否再加军方代表人数，各方自定。3，代表团随行人员各方为33人。
    关于总理级会谈议题问题，双方意见接近。北方提出的议题是：“关于消除北南政治、军事对峙和实现北南多方面交流与合作问题”。南方在表示同意这一议题的同时，认为应把“南北多方面交流与合作”放在“消除南北政治、军事对峙”之前。
    朝鲜北南副部长级代表会谈目前遗留的问题只有会谈议题问题和一些技术性问题。
    双方最后商定，明年1月31日在板门店北方一侧的“统一阁”举行第六次会谈。
