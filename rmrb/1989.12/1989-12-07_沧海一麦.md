A Grain of Wheat in the Vast Sea
Lí Yùhuá

In January 1988, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a meeting on the Huang-Huai-Hai region. Subsequently, the Academy, in collaboration with the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Hebei's Cangzhou region, jointly submitted a battle plan to the State Council.

Under the call of the State Council, a grand "Huang-Huai-Hai Campaign" was launched!

Two years later, among the experts with outstanding contributions who were honored to be received by the Party Central Committee and the State Council leaders, there was a man named Li Zhensheng. His materials read: "Li Zhensheng, 58 years old, research fellow, from Zibo, Shandong, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, director of the Institute of Genetics, and genetic breeding expert. He has been engaged in the distant hybridization breeding of wheat and wild rye for 30 years, cultivating a number of excellent wheat distant hybridization varieties. Among them, Xiaomian 6 won the National Invention First Prize, and made significant contributions in genetic theory and breeding practice. In recent years, he has played a huge role in the comprehensive treatment of the Huang-Huai-Hai region."

It was during his time at Shandong Agricultural College that Li Zhensheng became fascinated with genetics, wheat breeding, and plant physiology. Under the guidance of his teachers, he once attempted a crossbreeding experiment between wild grass and wheat, but unfortunately, it was unsuccessful. However, it sparked some ideas in him.

In 1951, Li Zhensheng graduated with excellent results from Shandong Agricultural College and became the first student recommended and assigned to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Since then, the idea of distant hybridization breeding of wheat has often lingered in his mind: "Wheat has been artificially cultivated for more than 5,000 years. Artificial selection has always been in the direction beneficial to humans, such as larger seeds, higher yield, and better quality, but often neglects its drought resistance, cold resistance, and disease and pest resistance. Wild grasses in nature are not managed by humans. If they do not adapt to the harsh natural environment and resist diseases and pests, they cannot survive. Therefore, wild plants are an important gene bank. Things lacking in cultivated plants can be found in wild plants."

The young Li Zhensheng was determined to pursue this goal.

In early 1956, Li Zhensheng, along with more than a dozen colleagues from the institute, responded to Premier Zhou's call to "support the Great Northwest" and came to Yangling Town (formerly Wugong) in Shaanxi Province, Chinese Academy of Sciences Northwest Institute of Agricultural Biology. Here, he unhesitatingly chose the topic of distant hybridization breeding of wheat and wild rye, which was approved by the director.

After years of struggle, after achieving initial success, Li Zhensheng said with deep feelings, "In scientific research, theoretical guidance is very important. Once the theory is truly understood and mastered, it will be effective in many ways! Observing the chromosomes that transmit life phenomena under a microscope, and observing the green life in the fields without regard for sun and rain, this work may be monotonous and tedious, but for Li Zhensheng, who is dedicated to exploring the secrets of wheat distant hybridization, it is full of endless interest. 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, he went from the fields to the laboratory, constantly exploring the establishment of a complete and rigorous scientific research system in the combination of theory and practice.

In the spring of 1964, continuous rain for 40 days, on June 14th, the temperature suddenly rose. A large area of wheat was completely withered and died. The wheat and wild rye hybrid offspring in Li Zhensheng's experimental field also could not withstand the scorching wind and withered in large areas.

He walked and searched unwillingly. Suddenly, two golden-colored hybrid single plants seemed indifferent to the scorching wind, standing tall and proud. He joyfully rushed over...

"This is the 'grandfather' of the later successfully cultivated Xiaomian 6," Li Zhensheng said humorously.

But just as the experiment achieved results, a cold wind suddenly blew. During the Cultural Revolution, waves of dirty water were poured on him. "Li Zhensheng's distant hybridization is fake, it's boasting and exaggerating! How can grass and wheat be crossbred?" For this, his self-examinations were always not passed.

The external criticism made it difficult for him to concentrate on scientific research, and the internal pressure made him restless: "Distant hybridization has been done for eight or nine years, and no varieties have been produced; the new varieties 'Shengxuan 5' and 'Shengxuan 7' produced through variety crossbreeding have not been widely promoted. Can varieties be produced or when can varieties be produced that can be widely promoted in production?" Li Zhensheng eagerly awaited the opportunity.

In the winter of 1969, Li Zhensheng and five other "stinking ninth category" were sent to Lianhe Commune in Baoji County, Shaanxi Province for "re-education." He stayed there for four years. He learned from the masses while spreading scientific knowledge, becoming a confidant of the peasant masses.

In 1979, Li Zhensheng and his research team finally successfully cultivated the new wheat variety "Xiaomian 6." "Xiaomian 6" is not only high-yielding and high-quality, with a protein content of 14.7% (ordinary wheat is 12%), but also surpasses general varieties in cold resistance, drought resistance, and disease and pest resistance. It brought about welcome social and economic benefits: by 1988, the planting area had reached more than 54 million mu, spanning 10 provinces, with a cumulative increase of 1.6 billion kilograms of wheat. This achievement won the 1985 National Natural Science Invention Award and the 1988 Chen Jiageng Award.

In the autumn of 1986, in the experimental field of Li Zhensheng at the Northwest Plant Research Institute in Yangling, Shaanxi, more than 100 experts and scholars attending the first International Plant Chromosome Engineering Academic Conference gathered, one after another, expressing admiration: "This work is really well done!"

What made them so interested? Originally, after "Xiaomian 6," Li Zhensheng made new breakthroughs in plant chromosome engineering research. He successfully cultivated a blue-grain single-monosome wheat, providing a special tool material for genetic breeding. With the blue-grain single-monosome wheat, it is very easy to obtain a large number of monosomic wheats and select self-pollinating monosomic wheats from them, thus establishing a new breeding method—wheat monosomic backcrossing. With this method, it only takes three to four years to transfer a heterologous chromosome into wheat and make it settle down, while the general distant hybridization breeding method takes at least seven to eight years or even longer.

Li Zhensheng and his research team are still continuing the research on blue-grain single-monosome wheat. He wants to transfer the blue gene to every chromosome of wheat, building a complete blue-grain single-monosome wheat system. Now they have already transferred seven. This means that a series of new wheat varieties like "Xiaomian 6" will continue to appear, and "Xiaomian wheat" will form a large "family."

Science knows no borders. Professor Campbell of the University of Missouri in the United States highly evaluated: "Li Zhensheng is a scientist with strong organizational and imaginative abilities. His research plan is comprehensive, including all aspects from application to theory. His work (blue-grain single-monosome wheat) has great value in cell genetics and provides an excellent genetic manipulation tool for future plant chromosome engineering. If we say that Sears opened up the possibility of chromosome gene localization in the 1950s, then we can say that Li Zhensheng opened up the possibility of chromosome engineering (monosomic) breeding in the 1980s."

Sears, the 76-year-old world-renowned founder of plant chromosome engineering, also flew across the ocean from the United States to see Li Zhensheng's "blue monosome." He said, "I once did an experiment using disease resistance as a genetic marker, but it was not successful. Now Li Zhensheng has done it with blue grains!"

At the suggestion of Professor Sears and Professor Ryle of Britain, Li Zhensheng was elected as the chairman of the second International Plant Chromosome Engineering Academic Conference held in 1990.

In March 1988, 600 scientific researchers from various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences entered the front line of agricultural development in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Li Zhensheng, as the commander-in-chief of a multi-force battle, often went to the grassroots experimental points to understand the situation and worked with everyone to tackle key scientific and technological difficulties.

A year passed, and the "Huang-Huai-Hai Campaign" won the first battle. The experimental demonstration bases of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Huang-Huai-Hai region increased from 3 to 21, and each point bore abundant fruits!

The State Council awarded honors and prizes to the heroes of the "Huang-Huai-Hai Campaign." The Chinese Academy of Sciences had 1 person receiving an honorary award, 4 people receiving first-class awards, and 16 people receiving second-class awards!

The wheat waves rolled in the saline-alkali land, the rice fields were fragrant with fish leaping, the irrigation canals crisscrossed the long-dry fields, and the sandy wasteland was laden with fruits. The former "Huang-Huai-Hai" has changed greatly. "If you don't look three steps ahead, you won't be considered a good chess player," Li Zhensheng is already considering the second battle.

    著名遗传育种专家、中科院副院长李振声，致力于小麦和野草的远缘杂交试验。他和同事们培育出的“小偃六号”，获国家自然科学发明奖。近年又为黄淮海综合治理做出了重要贡献。他，默默地勤奋工作，甘做——
    沧海一麦
    黎玉华
    1988年1月，中科院召开黄淮海工作会议。随后，中科院分别与山东、河南、安徽、河北省沧州地区联合向国务院写了请战报告。
    在国务院的号召下，一个宏伟的“黄淮海战役”打响了！
    两年后，在光荣地接受党中央、国务院领导接见的有突出贡献的专家当中，有一位叫李振声。在他的材料上是这样写的：“李振声，58岁，研究员，山东淄博市人，中国科学院副院长、遗传所所长、遗传育种专家。从事小麦偃麦草远缘杂交育种工作30年，培育成一批小麦远缘杂交优良品种，其中小偃6号获国家发明一等奖，在遗传理论和育种实践方面作出重大贡献。近几年来，对黄淮海综合治理起了巨大作用。”
    还是在山东农学院念书时，李振声就迷上了遗传、小麦育种、植物生理三门课。在老师指导下，他曾做过一次野草和小麦的杂交，可惜没有成功，但使他产生了一些想法。
    1951年，李振声以优异成绩毕业于山东农学院，并成为该校第一个被推荐和分配到中国科学院工作的学生。
    此后，搞小麦远缘杂交育种的念头时常萦绕在他的心头：“小麦，人工栽培已有5000多年了，人工选择都是朝着对人类有利的方向进行的，如种子大、产量高、品质好等，对它的抗旱、抗寒、抗病虫等习性却常常忽略；而野草在自然界没人管，如果它不去适应自然界的恶劣环境，抵抗病虫危害，就无法生存。所以说，野生植物是一个很重要的基因库，栽培植物中缺少的东西可到野生植物中去找。”
    年轻的李振声认准了这个目标，决心走下去。
    1956年初，李振声和所里的十几位同志一道，响应周总理发出的“支援大西北”的号召，来到陕西武功（现名杨陵镇）中科院西北农业生物研究所。在这里，他毫不犹豫地选了小麦和偃草远缘杂交育种的课题，得到了所长的同意。
    经过多年的奋斗，取得初步成功以后，李振声很有感触地说，搞科学，理论指导很重要，理论真正弄通弄透了，就会一通百通！在显微镜下观察一条条传递生命现象的染色体，在大田里不顾日晒雨淋观察那一株株绿色的生命，这工作也许是单调枯燥的，但对一心探求小麦远缘杂交奥秘的李振声来说，却有着无穷的兴味。10年，20年，30年，他就是从田间到实验室，在理论和实践结合上，不断为建立一套完整严密的科研体系而探索着。
    1964年麦收前，连续40天阴雨，6月14日，气温骤然上升。大面积麦子全部青干枯死。李振声试验田里的小麦与偃麦草杂后代，也没能抵住干热风的袭击而大片干枯了。
    他不甘心地走着、搜寻着。突然，两棵金黄色的杂种单株，似乎对干热风的袭击毫不在乎，高高地昂着头，他欣喜地奔过去……
    “这就是我后来培育成功的小偃6号的‘爷爷’。”李振声诙谐地说。
    可就在实验刚刚取得成果时，冷风又乍然而起。“文革”中，阵阵污水向他泼来。“李振声的远缘杂交是假的，是吹嘘夸大！草怎么能和麦子杂交？”为此，他的检查老是通不过。
    外来的责难使他无法安心搞科研，内心的压力更令他坐卧不安：“远缘杂交搞了八九年，还没拿出品种来；通过品种间杂交育成的‘生选5号’与‘生选7号’小麦新品种，还没有大面积推广开。究竟能不能或何时能育成在生产上大面积推广的品种呢？”李振声焦急地盼望着时机。
    1969年冬，李振声和其他5位“臭老九”被打发到陕西省宝鸡县联合大队接受“再教育”。他在这里一呆就是4年。他边学习群众经验，边传播科学知识，成为农民群众的知心人。
    1979年，李振声和他的课题组终于培育成功“小偃6号”小麦新品种。“小偃6号”不仅高产、优质，蛋白质含量达14.7％（普通小麦为12％），而且在抗寒、抗旱、抗病虫害等方面都超过了一般品种。它带来了可喜的社会效益和经济效益：1988年种植面积已达5400多万亩，横跨10个省，累计增产小麦16亿公斤。这一成果获得了1985年国家自然科学发明奖，1988年又获得陈嘉庚奖。
    1986年秋，陕西杨陵西北植物研究所李振声的试验田里，聚集着100来位参加首届国际植物染色体工程学术讨论会的中外专家、学者，他们一个个啧啧赞叹：“这项工作做得真不错！”
    是什么使他们这么感兴趣？原来，李振声继“小偃6号”以后，又在植物染色体工程研究上有了新的突破，他培育成功一种蓝粒单体小麦，为遗传育种提供了特殊的工具材料。有了蓝粒单体小麦，就很容易得到大量的缺体小麦，并从中选出能自花结实的缺体小麦，这就使他建立了一种全新的育种方法——小麦缺体回交法。有了这种方法，只需三年四代即可把一个异源染色体转入小麦中去，并使它安家落户，而一般远缘杂交育种法则至少需要七八年甚至更长时间。
    李振声与他研究组的同志们还在继续做蓝粒单体小麦的研究，他想使蓝色基因转到小麦的每一条染色体上去，建成一个完整的蓝粒单体小麦系统。现在他们已经转成了7条。这就意味着，像“小偃6号”那样的系列小麦新品种将会不断出现，“小偃麦”将会形成一个庞大的“家族”。
    科学是没有国界的。美国密苏里大学的肯贝尔教授高度评价说：“李振声是一个组织能力、想象力很强的科学家，他的研究计划很全面，包括了从应用到理论的所有环节，他的工作（蓝粒单体小麦）有极大的细胞遗传学价值，为今后的植物染色体工程提供了一个极好的遗传操纵工具。如果说西尔斯50年代开创了染色体基因定位的可能性，那么我们可以说，李振声则在80年代开创了染色体工程（缺体）育种的可能性。”
    西尔斯，这位76岁的世界著名的植物染色工程奠基人，也从美国飞渡重洋，来看李振声的“蓝单体”，他说：“过去我曾做过以抗病性作为遗传标记的试验，但没做成功，现在李振声用蓝粒做成了！”
    在西尔斯教授和英国瑞勒教授提议下，李振声被推选为1990年召开的第二届国际植物染色体工程学术大会的主席。
    1988年3月，中科院各研究所600名科研人员，纷纷进入黄淮海平原农业开发第一线。李振声作为统领多兵种作战的一名主帅，经常亲自到最基层试验点去了解情况，与大家一起力攻科技难关。
    一年过去了，“黄淮海战役”首战告捷。中科院在黄淮海地区的试验示范基地已从3个增至21个，每个点都结出了丰硕之果！
    国务院为“黄淮海战役”的英雄颁功授奖，中科院有1人获荣誉奖，4个人获一等奖，16人获二等奖！
    盐碱地麦浪翻滚，湿洼地稻香鱼跃，久旱田水渠纵横，沙荒地硕果累累。昔日“黄淮海”已经大变样了。“不看三步棋，不算会下棋”，李振声又在考虑第二个战役了。
