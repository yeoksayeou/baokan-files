India's newly appointed Interior Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed's daughter was kidnapped on the 8th in the Srinagar region of Indian-controlled Kashmir. This kidnapping is believed to be politically motivated.

According to messages received in New Delhi on the 9th, the minister's youngest daughter, 21-year-old Rabia Sayeed, was abducted while returning home in a small car.

Shortly after the incident, a member of the "Kashmir Liberation Front," claiming responsibility for Rabia's kidnapping, notified local newspapers that Rabia was unharmed and under their organization's custody. They demanded the release of five of their organization's activists from the police station in exchange for her release.

This kidnapping occurred three days after M. M. Sayeed was appointed as the central government's Interior Minister.

The "Kashmir Liberation Front" is a radical Muslim armed organization opposed to Indian control of the region.

    印度内政部长的女儿遭绑架
    印度新任内政部长穆夫蒂·穆罕默德·赛义德的女儿八日在印度控制的克什米尔地区的斯内那加遭绑架。这次绑架被认为是政治性的。
    据新德里九日收到的消息说，这位部长的最小女儿、二十一岁的拉比亚·赛义德是在乘坐小汽车回家的途中遭劫持的。
    事发后不久，一名自称绑架了拉比亚的“克什米尔解放阵线”的成员通知当地报纸说，拉比亚安然无恙，正处于他们的组织的监护之下。并声称，只有在警察局释放其组织的五名活动分子后，他们才能放她。
    此次绑架事件发生在穆·穆·赛义德被任命为中央政府内政部长后的第三天。
    “克什米尔解放阵线”是反对印度控制该地区的激进的穆斯林武装组织。
