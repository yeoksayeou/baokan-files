Li Chenggong, who is the same age as the People's Republic, is the Party Committee Secretary of a certain company under the 19th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. He has been working in the positions of grassroots Party Committee and branch secretary for 11 years. In the past two years, Li Chenggong has been awarded the honorary titles of "Excellent Ideological and Political Worker" by the China Railway Construction Corporation and "Excellent Party Affairs Worker" by the Liaoyang Municipal Party Committee.

Over the past decade, Li Chenggong has increasingly gained the trust and respect of the workers. What is the secret? The workers' words are simple: "He is principled, not just towards others, but more so towards himself."

Li Chenggong has been a cadre for nearly 20 years, during which he has worked in a motor transport unit for 13 years. He has never used his authority to do a single private favor for himself or his relatives. Li Chenggong has been living a life of separation from his wife. Every time his wife comes to the unit, he has never used a public vehicle to pick her up. Some people say he is a bit unreasonable. Li Chenggong, however, says: "Reason" also has its degrees, getting close to personal reason, would mean distancing oneself from the reason of the Party and the people.

In the early spring of 1989, a worker from the company went to Sichuan on business and visited his home. This is an office of the township Women's Federation, where his wife works, and it also serves as his temporary home. The kitchen is a makeshift shed, and during windy or rainy days, water leaks from all sides. In the less than 16 square meters of space, there is a double bed, a round table, an old sofa, a coffee table, and a small tape recorder. The worker looked at the secretary's entire belongings and saw his wife's frail body, and his eyes welled up with tears.

Li Chenggong's wife suffers from multiple diseases including rheumatic heart disease, malignant anemia, low blood pressure, and duodenal ulcers, often bedridden. How much she needs her husband by her side to take care of her! Once, when his wife attended a meeting in the township, she fainted in the hallway for over an hour before being found and sent to the hospital.

Li Chenggong has never mentioned his family's difficulties to the organization and has silently borne the burden of his family. In 1985, a comrade who was working as a leader in the Chuan Dong Cement Plant learned of his family's difficulties and prepared to help him transfer to the plant, arranging for his wife as well, and repeatedly wrote to him to handle the procedures. Li Chenggong, of course, wanted to return to his wife and children, but when he thought of his responsibilities, the idea of transferring back was dismissed. In November 1986, after returning from a study trip abroad, he received a letter from home informing him that his mother had passed away. Those days, the company was holding a Party Committee meeting and a workers' congress, and he secretly cried alone. "Unfeeling does not necessarily make a true hero," but when workers encounter difficulties, he always finds ways to help solve them. In the past two years, the company has done everything possible to help those workers whose families have suffered misfortunes.

As a grassroots Party ideological and political worker, Li Chenggong is good at implementing Party principles in the actions of Party members and the masses. For the sake of the Party and the people, he has made many personal sacrifices. As he said at the rectification of Party style report meeting of the entire bureau: "The spirit of self-sacrifice is the embodiment of a communist's Party principles."

### 对自己更讲原则的李成功

    对自己更讲原则的李成功
    王运良　樊景文　朱斌
    与共和国同龄的李成功，是铁道部19工程局某公司党委书记。在基层党委、支部书记的岗位上他已经工作了11年。这两年，李成功分别获得中国铁道建筑总公司和中共辽阳市委授予“优秀思想政治工作者”、“优秀党务工作者”光荣称号。
    十多年来，李成功越来越受职工们的信赖和尊敬，奥秘在哪儿呢？工人们的话是朴实的：“他讲原则可不是光对着别人，他对自己更原则。”
    李成功当干部近20年，其间在汽车运输单位任职13年，没有用手中的权力为自己和亲友办过一件私事。李成功一直过着夫妻分居的生活，爱人每次来队，他从未用公家的车接送一次。有些人说他确实有点不近情理。李成功却说：“情理”也有大小之分，近了个人的情理，就远了党和人民的情理。
    1989年初春，公司一名工人到四川出差，顺便到了他家。这是乡政府妇联的一间办公室，既是他爱人办公的地方，又权且算作他的家。厨房是临时搭的棚，遇上刮风下雨，四处漏水，在不到16平方米的空间，摆放着一张双人床、一张圆桌、一对旧沙发、一个茶几、一台小型录音机。这位工人环顾李书记的全部家当，看着书记爱人瘦弱的身体，顿时眼窝发热，鼻子发酸。
    李成功的爱人身患风湿性心脏病、恶性贫血、低血压、十二指肠溃疡等多种疾病，常常卧床不起，多么需要丈夫在身边照顾呀！有一次爱人到乡里开会，昏倒在走廊上长达一个多小时，被人发现送到医院。
    李成功从没有向组织讲过家庭困难，默默承受着家庭的重负。1985年，在川东水泥厂做领导工作的战友得知他的家庭困难后，准备帮他调到厂里工作，并连同他爱人一起安排，多次来信催他办手续。李成功何尝不想回到妻子和孩子身边，但是，他一想到自己的责任，调回去的念头又打消了。1986年11月，他到外地学习归队不久，又接到家里来信，告诉他母亲已经去世。那几天，公司正开党委会和职代会，他背地里偷偷哭了一场。“无情未必真豪杰”，当职工有了困难，他总是想方设法帮助解决，近两年，公司千方百计地为那些家庭遭受不幸的职工解决燃眉之急。
    作为一名基层党的思想政治工作者，李成功善于把党的原则落实到党员和群众的行动中去，为了党和人民的利益，他做了许多自我牺牲。正如他在全局端正党风事迹报告会上说的那样：“自我牺牲精神，是共产党人党性原则的体现。”
