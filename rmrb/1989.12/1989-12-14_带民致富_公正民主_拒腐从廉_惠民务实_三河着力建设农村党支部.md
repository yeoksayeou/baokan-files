    Three River County Focuses on Building Rural Party Branches

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Zhenggen, People's Daily reporter Huang Caizhong report: “Rural work is fraught with difficulties, but building a good party branch leadership is not difficult.” This is the profound experience of the Three River County Committee in Hebei Province, which has insisted on strengthening the construction of rural party branches over the past few years to inject new vitality into all aspects of work in response to the requirements of reform and opening up.

    The first step of rural reform, marked mainly by the household contract responsibility system, has brought about tremendous changes in the organization of labor, the distribution of products, and the ideological concepts of farmers. Faced with these major changes, most rural cadres in Three River County felt at a loss.

    The Three River County Committee correctly handled the relationship between economic construction and party branch construction, clearly proposed and insisted on building rural party branches according to four standards:

    — Build a leadership team dedicated to leading the people to common prosperity. The county committee clearly pointed out that village party secretaries and village cadres are different from ordinary people and must have strong abilities to lead the people to prosperity. They must first lead the people to common prosperity and then think about personal prosperity. In recent years, 805 village-run enterprises have been established, of which 80% were started by party branch secretaries.

    — Build a fair and democratic team. Village cadres handle affairs impartially. When there are matters to be discussed with the people, the relationship between cadres and the masses is harmonious, and rural work is easy to carry out. The party branch of Xingrenzhuang Village established a village people's congress system in the village, selecting 40 village representatives by the people, holding a congress every season. After forming a resolution, it is announced to the public through broadcasts and notices, accepting supervision from the people. The county committee promoted the experience of this party branch throughout the county. Now, all 395 villages in the county have established party member congresses and village people's congresses.

    — Build a team that resists corruption and maintains integrity. After the household contract responsibility system, the power of the village has become greater. Whether the party branch can correctly exercise power and maintain and carry forward the good style of hard work and selflessness is a test. Therefore, the county committee regards the integrity of cadres as an important standard for party branch construction.

    — Build a team that benefits the people and is practical. In the construction of the team, the county committee advocates benefiting the people and being practical, opposing empty talk and no action. Among the village party branch secretaries, a group of practical workers who truly serve the people have emerged. The party branch secretary of Dazao Village, Gao Baochang, has food processing and weaving skills. Many relatives and friends came to him to discuss setting up enterprises together, all of which were rejected by him. He led the cadres and the masses to set up 4 enterprises for the village, using the income from the enterprises to benefit everyone.

    Because the Three River County Committee strictly adheres to the above four standards to build rural party branch teams, it adapts to the needs of reform and opening up, meets the wishes of the people, and enhances the attractiveness, cohesion, and combat effectiveness of the party branches. Many difficult tasks have become easy, and the countryside presents a new look. The annual procurement of summer grain is 10 million kilograms, and the procurement of autumn grain is 20 million kilograms, both of which are completed within 7 days to half a month. This year, the total income of township enterprises in the county can reach 1.1 billion yuan, fiscal revenue can reach 43 million yuan, and the per capita income of farmers is 802 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan compared to last year.

    带民致富  公正民主  拒腐从廉  惠民务实
    三河着力建设农村党支部
    本报讯　新华社记者黄正根、本报记者黄彩忠报道：“农村工作千难万难，建设好党支部班子什么都不难。”这是河北省三河县委为适应改革开放的要求，几年来坚持抓好农村党支部建设，给各项工作注入了新的生机和活力后的深刻体会。
    以联产承包责任制为主要标志的农村第一步改革，给农村带来了劳动组织形式、产品分配形式和农民思想观念等方面的巨大变化。面对这些重大变革，三河县多数农村干部感到茫然。
    三河县委正确处理经济建设与支部建设的关系，明确提出并坚持按照四个标准建设农村党支部：
    ——建设致力于带领群众共同致富的领导班子。县委明确指出，村支部书记、村干部不同于一般群众，必须具有较强的致富本领，坚持首先带领群众共同致富，然后才是个人致富。近几年新上村办企业805个，其中80％是靠支部书记搞起来的。
    ——建设公正民主的班子。村干部秉公办事。有事同群众商量，干群关系就融洽，农村工作就好开展。行仁庄村党支部在村里建立了村民议政会制度，由群众选出40名村民代表，每季召开一次议政会。形成决议后用广播、布告的形式公开，接受群众监督。县委在全县推广了这个支部的经验。现在全县395个村都建立了党员议事会、村民议事会制度。
    ——建设拒腐从廉的班子。联产承包以后，村的权力更大了。党支部能否正确行使权力，保持和发扬艰苦奋斗、克己奉公的好作风，这是一个考验。因此县委把干部廉洁自律作为支部建设的重要标准。
    ——建设惠民务实的班子。在班子建设中，县委提倡惠民务实，反对光说不干，在农村党支部书记中涌现出一批真心为民服务的实干家。大枣林村党支部书记高宝常具有食品加工和编织技术，不少亲朋好友找上门来想和他联合办企业，都被他谢绝。他带领干部、群众为村里办起4个企业，用企业的收入造福于大家。
    三河县委由于严格按照上述四条标准建设农村党支部班子，适应了改革开放的需要，符合群众的心愿，增强了党支部的吸引力、凝聚力和战斗力。很多工作由难变易，农村展现出崭新气象。夏粮征购每年1000万公斤，秋粮征购2000万公斤，7天至半月就全部完成。今年全县乡镇企业总收入可达11亿元，财政收入可达4300万元，农民人均收入802元，比去年增加20元。
