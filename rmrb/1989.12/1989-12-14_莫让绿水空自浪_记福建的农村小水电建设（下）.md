The waterfalls in Min Province hold potential electrical energy, the greater the drop, the better. However, another kind of "gap" is seriously hindering the development of small hydropower.

"Prices from the 1980s, electricity rates from the 1950s"

Everywhere reporters went, they heard complaints about the low electricity prices for small hydropower. As they put it: "Prices from the 1980s, electricity rates from the 1950s. It's impossible to make electricity this way!"

How did this "gap" come about? First, there are the bank loan interest rates. The director of the Yongchun County Water Electricity Bureau, Wang Jincui, used the Xiakou Power Station in this county as an example and did some calculations: The power station was completed in September 1983, but to this day it is still in debt. The power station borrowed 3 million yuan from the bank in 1982, with a monthly interest rate of 0.42%. The power station uses nearly half of its annual income to repay the debt. In five and a half years, it has repaid 1.45 million yuan in principal and interest, but by March of this year, it still owes the bank 2.95 million yuan. Why? The electricity price is fixed, at 0.05 yuan per kilowatt-hour and has not changed; the power station's electricity generation is also fixed, with a certain amount of installed capacity that cannot be increased like a person biting the bullet to bear more; while the loan interest rate is flexible, rising every year: 0.42%, 0.68%, 0.72%, 0.84%, and now it's over 1.9%. The more you repay, the more you owe. No wonder Director Wang said: "This power station is basically run for the bank."

The director of the Shaxian County Guanchang Reservoir Management Office, Zheng Guisen, manages four levels of power stations, three of which were built earlier. The cost was not as high then, so the benefits are still passable. However, the newly built Langkou Power Station is different. He said: If the money from the other three stations is not used to supplement it, this station will probably take 62 years to recover the investment, while the lifespan of a set of power station equipment is only about 20 to 30 years. The equipment will be scrapped before the debt is repaid.

Another factor contributing to the large "gap" is the sharp rise in the prices of raw materials and equipment. The provincial local power company introduced: The main materials used for building stations have all increased several times, while the electricity price of small hydropower has always been contributing to stable prices.

Small hydropower is originally "agricultural," and has always been favored, with low loan interest rates and planned low-priced raw materials also "cutting" a piece. Of course, people miss the days of 0.18% monthly loan interest, which cannot be repeated. But treating it the same as other enterprises and businesses, small hydropower with a long construction period really can't take it.

The negative effects of the abnormal "gap"

The abnormal "gap" between construction costs and electricity prices has led to various strange phenomena:

First, "electric tigers" raise electricity.

Every summer, Fujian's wet season has abundant electricity. To reduce losses and increase profits, many high-energy-consuming enterprises have been set up, such as smelting ferroalloys and crystalline silicon, with good benefits. When we arrived in Fujian, it was already early winter, and the dry season had begun. However, some "electric tigers" were still smoking day and night. The party secretary of Fukuo Township in Shaxian County, Chen Jialu, explained the logic of "electric tigers" raising electricity. This township's newly built Baozhangdi Power Station, if it sells electricity to the large grid at 0.05 yuan per kilowatt-hour, it would be difficult to recover the investment in 20 years, let alone make a profit. Therefore, the township invested more than 1 million yuan to set up an "electric tiger" - a ferroalloy factory, which can make a profit of about 6 million yuan in one year, consuming nearly 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. The ferroalloy factory buys electricity from the power station at 0.09 yuan per kilowatt-hour. The power station increases its income by 4 million yuan per year. In addition, the township can also collect nearly 1 million yuan in education surcharges and other fees.

Chen, the party secretary, does not consider raising electricity with "electric tigers" to be a "good strategy." He said: "If the grid raises the electricity price to 0.1 yuan, why should I bother to raise this 'electric tiger'?" It is understood that in Fujian, there are nearly 100 such electricity-raising "electric tigers."

Second, it is better to "sell" electricity than to build it.

"Building electricity is in debt, using and supplying electricity is profitable." Everyone says so. It is easy to understand how electricity users make money, as the lower the electricity price, the better it is for electricity-using enterprises. How do electricity suppliers make money? Old Guo from the Quanzhou City Water Electricity Bureau gave an interesting example. In all of Fujian, only Jinjiang, Dongshan, and a few other counties have no hydropower stations, and Jinjiang is managed by Quanzhou. The county power company only buys electricity from the large grid and sells it to users. However, this company's profit this year can reach 40 million yuan, more than twice that of other counties that combine power generation and supply.

The abnormal "gap" has dampened the enthusiasm of all parties to build electricity. Deputy Director Zhang Guisheng of the provincial water electricity bureau said: Although it cannot be said that it has "slipped," the construction pace has indeed slowed down in the past two years.

On the county's financial "plate"

Can electricity prices be adjusted? In many places, this has become a "minefield." Although higher authorities have clear regulations that small hydropower can set its own prices, it is difficult to truly implement this due to various constraints. County Magistrate Zhang of Yuxi County said: Electricity prices are the most headache for county leaders and the most discussed issue, but they dare not touch it. He has his difficulties. The county's industrial enterprises are very fragile. Once the electricity price is raised, the enterprises will cry out, some will reduce profits, and some may even go bankrupt. What to do with the reduction in county financial income? Who will solve the employment problem... Pulling one hair moves the whole body!

However, reporters found that counties such as Minqing, Shaxian, Yongchun, and Dehua have also dared to "take risks and break the rules," adopting some flexible measures. Some implement different electricity prices for wet and dry seasons, peak and off-peak periods; some set a base electricity usage for enterprises, with additional charges for exceeding the base; some set different electricity prices for different industries; and some implement a "new price for new electricity" to ensure the cost recovery of new power stations.

Datian County seems to have gone the furthest, decisively establishing a small hydropower construction fund system. Industrial electricity is increased by 0.04 yuan per kilowatt-hour, which can raise 24 million yuan per year for small hydropower construction. Deputy County Magistrate Chen Peizhu, who is in charge of rural electricity, said: There was also resistance when this matter was brewing. Factories shouted about reducing profits handed over. But the county did not waver: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong use high-priced electricity of five or six jiao per kilowatt-hour to create 10 yuan of output value, while we only use 0.1 yuan per kilowatt-hour to create 2-3 yuan of output value. Can we say there is no potential? As a result, the fund was collected, the enterprises did not reduce profits, and no factory closed down because of this.

On the county's financial "plate," is it to continue "sacrificing electricity to protect industry," or to "force industry to promote electricity"? It seems that every county magistrate has to seriously consider this move. Of course, some "moves" county magistrates cannot make, and even mayors are powerless.

Both "agricultural" and "energy"

In Fuzhou, the manager of the provincial local power company, Chen Jufu, said a few thought-provoking words. He said: If a unit loses a few tons of diesel or coal, it must be treated as a case and seriously investigated. However, the river water flows east, and a large amount of electric energy is wasted, but it is rarely noticed, and even fewer people care. Because small hydropower is "small," people do not pay attention to it.

This leader in charge of small hydropower construction in the entire province continued: Now Fujian has thermal power, hydropower, and within hydropower, there is a distinction between large and small; the grid has a distinction between national and local. Due to ideological biases and scheduling issues, small hydropower is often squeezed into the most embarrassing position. Electricity prices are not fair, thermal power plants sell electricity at 0.25 yuan per kilowatt-hour, plus national subsidies, it's over 0.3 yuan; large hydropower can also be priced according to construction costs. Only small hydropower can be sold for a few jiao, and counties want to raise prices but can't, the price department will interfere. Electricity scheduling is also unfair. During the wet season with abundant electricity, small hydropower stations are severely restricted from generating electricity. Originally, the electricity price is low, and if it is restricted, it will be even more "hungry." The Qianling Power Station in Shaowu City was forced to abandon water in June, July, and August this year, reducing electricity generation by 6 million kilowatt-hours. Calculated at the electricity price of 0.05 yuan, it will reduce income by 300,000 yuan. While generating this much electricity with diesel, it will consume 1,500 tons of oil!

Being squeezed and pressured, is it because it is "small" and has poor benefits? The comrades from the Fujian hydropower department oppose this view. They believe that building small hydropower according to local conditions has its advantages in material consumption, construction costs, and production efficiency compared to large hydropower. Moreover, only small power stations can be built on small rivers and streams. For vast remote mountainous areas, "small" is more suitable. In many remote mountainous areas in Fujian, the mountain people who have suffered from the lack of electricity celebrate the arrival of electricity like celebrating the New Year, saying it is their "second liberation."

Currently, the small hydropower that has been developed in Fujian only accounts for 1/3 of the developable amount. How to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grassroots, rely on the strength of the broad masses of farmers, and develop the electric energy hidden in the countless gullies and ravines? How to more economically bring the civilization of electricity to every household, every factory, and every store? This is something that relevant decision-makers, especially those who still have doubts about small hydropower, need to think about. It is both "agricultural" and "energy," and is a national industrial policy that clearly states it should be given priority support. (Accompanied by a picture)

    莫让绿水空自浪
    ——记福建的农村小水电建设（下）
    吴锦才　宋红岗　吴长生
    八闽溪水的落差中间蕴藏着电能，这种落差越大越好。但另一种“落差”，却严重困扰着小水电事业的发展。
      “80年代的造价，50年代的电价”
    记者每到一处，谈不上几句话，就会听到对小水电电价低的抱怨。用他们的话说是：“80年代的造价，50年代的电价。电没法办了！”
    “落差”是怎么形成的？首先是银行的贷款利率。永春县水电局局长王金池以这个县的横口电站为例，算了一笔账：1983年9月电站落成，但时至今日它仍负债累累。电站1982年从银行贷款300万元，当时的月息是4厘2。电站年年拿出差不多一半的收入还债，5年半共还本付息145万元，可到今年3月，仍欠银行295万元。为什么？电价是死的，每千瓦时（度）5分一直没变；电站的发电量也是死的，装机容量多少就是多少，不能像人似的咬咬牙就能多扛点；而贷款利率可是活的，年年涨：4厘2，6厘8，7厘2，8厘4，到现在已19厘多了，债越还越多。难怪王局长说：“这电站等于是给银行办的。”
    沙县官昌水库管理处主任郑桂笙，下管着四级电站，其中三个是早几年办的，当时的成本还没有现在这么高，因而效益还能凑合。新建的琅口电站却不行了，他说：如果不用那三个站的钱补它，这个电站大概得用62年才能收回投资，而一套电站设备的寿命也就二三十年。不等债还完，设备就报废了。
    引起大“落差”的，还有原材料、设备价格的暴涨。省地方电力公司介绍：建站用的主要材料全是成倍地涨，而小水电的电价却一直为稳定物价做着贡献。
    小水电本姓“农”，过去一直受照顾，贷款利息低，计划内的平价原材料也“切”一块。固然，人们怀念贷款月息1厘8的年月，不可能再复返了。但与办其他企业、跑买卖“一视同仁”，建设周期长的小水电实在受不了。
            反常“落差”的负效应
    造价与电价的反常“落差”，引出了种种怪现象：
    其一，“电老虎”养电。
    每年夏季，福建丰水期电量充足。为了减损增收，各地兴办了不少高耗能企业，冶炼铁合金、结晶硅，效益不错。我们到福建时，已值初冬，早进入枯水期了，可一些“电老虎”还在昼夜冒着烟。沙县富口乡党委书记陈家禄讲了一番“电老虎”养电的道理。这个乡新建的百丈沶电站，若按5分钱一度向大电网卖电，20年也难以收回投资，更不用说盈利。于是乡里投资100多万元，办起了“电老虎”——硅铁厂，1年可得利60来万元，耗电近1000万千瓦时，硅铁厂按9分一千瓦时买电站的电。电站一年增收40万元。此外，乡里还可以收到近10万元的教育附加费等。
    用“电老虎”养电，陈书记也不认为是“上策”。他说：
  “如果大网把电价提到1角钱，我何苦费事养这个‘电老虎’？”据了解，在福建这类养电的“电老虎”有近百个。
    其二，办电不如“倒”电。
      “办电的负债，用电、供电的发财。”大家都这么说。用电的发财好理解，对用电企业来说，电价越低自然好处越大。供电的怎么发财呢？泉州市水电局老郭举的一个例子挺有意思。全福建，只晋江、东山等三个县一个水电站也没有，晋江归泉州管。县电力公司只管从大网买电、向用户卖电。可这个公司今年盈利可达400万元，比别的发供电结合的县多1倍以上。
    反常的“落差”已挫伤了各方办电的积极性。省水电厅张贵生副厅长说：现在虽不能说已经“滑坡”，但近两年建设步伐放慢确是实情。
          在县财政的“盘子”上
    电价能不能动？在许多地方，这成了“雷区”。尽管上级对小水电有可以自定电价的明确规定，但是由于各方的牵制，很难真正实行。尤溪县张县长说：电价是县领导最头疼，也是议论最多的问题，但总不敢动。他确有难处，县办工业都很脆弱，一提电价，企业嗷嗷叫，有的要减利，有的可能会倒闭，县财政收入减了怎么办？就业问题谁解决……牵一发动全身！
    但是，记者发现，闽清、沙县、永春、德化等一些县也大胆“冒险犯禁”，采用一些变通办法。有的实行丰枯水期、高低峰期不同电价；有的对企业核定用电基数，超基数加价；有的对不同行业规定不同电价；还有的对新建电站实行保本的“新电新价”。
    大田县似乎走得最远，果断地建立了小水电建设基金制，工业用电每千瓦时加收4分钱，1年可由此筹集240万元用于小水电建设。主管农电的陈培祝副县长说：酝酿此事时，阻力也不小。工厂叫嚷着减少上交利润。可县里没动摇：江浙、广东用五六毛一度的高价电，创10来元的产值，我们1度电才一毛多，创产值也才两、三元。这能说没潜力吗？结果基金收了，企业没减利，也没有厂子因此倒闭。
    在县财政的“盘子”上，是继续“损电保工”，还是“逼工兴电”？看来每个县长都得认真下下这步棋。当然，有的
  “棋”县长也下不了，甚至市长也无能为力。
            姓“农”又姓“能”
    在福州，省地方电力公司经理陈居福的几句话很耐人寻味。他说：如果哪个单位丢了几吨柴油或煤炭，一定要当件案子来认真查处。可是，溪水东流，白白流失了大量电能，却很少引人注意，更少有人心疼。因为小水电姓“小”，人们不重视它。
    这位主管全省小水电建设的领导接着说：现在福建有火电，有水电，水电中又有大小之分；电网有国家与地方之分。由于思想上的偏见和调度等方面的原因，小水电常常被挤到最难堪的位置。电价就不公平，火电厂的每千瓦时卖2角5分，加上国家补贴就3角多；大水电也可按建设成本定价。就小水电只能卖几分钱，县里想提都不行，物价部门要干涉。电能调度也不公平，丰水期电多，就狠限制小水电站发电。本来电价就低，再限制就更闹“饥荒”了。邵武市千岭电站今年6、7、8三个月被迫弃水，少发电600万千瓦时，按5分的电价计算，也要减收30万元。而用柴油发这么多电，得耗油1500吨！
    受挤受压，是不是因为它“小”而效益差呢？福建水电部门的同志反对这种观点。他们认为，因地制宜办小水电，在材料消耗、建设成本以及生产效率上，与大水电比，有其优越之处。况且，小河小溪上只能建小电站。对广大偏僻山乡来说，“小”更适宜。在福建许多偏远山区，饱尝无电之苦的山民们，像过年那样，放炮鸣锣欢庆通电，说这是“第二次解放”。
    目前，福建已开发的小水电，只占可开发量的1／3。怎样更充分地调动基层的积极性，依靠广大农民的力量，把蕴藏在千沟万壑的电能开发出来？更经济地把电的文明送到千家万户、千厂万店？这倒是有关决策者，特别是对小水电尚存疑虑的同志，需要好好想想的。它既姓“农”，又姓“能”，是国家产业政策明确要优先扶持的。（附图片）
