	Yellow River
	Yuán Dōngqīng

	1	Your roar is a stirring march song,
	Singing us into surf-riding fish,
	Leaping over the Dragon Gate.
	Those who leap over are fish,
	Those who do not leap over are also fish.

	2	The land you irrigate grows golden wheat,
	Each grain holds a world of meaning!
	Fish swim in, chew on fragrant Chinese bread.

	3	The more you flow, the murkier you become,
	The more you flow, the richer you become.
	The wine of Pangu intoxicates Li Bai,
	Who writes many drunken poems.
	It intoxicates Du Fu,
	Whose thatched cottage is broken by autumn winds,
	And he doesn't know
	That "The Classic of Waterways" by Li Daoyuan
	Is still full of the scent of wine.

	4	The yellow-bound Chinese editions,
	The illustrations within record
	One dream after another struggling on the wave crests,
	A myth that has slept for a long time.
	Every yellow-skinned fish is reading.
	Whoever reads and understands is a filial son.

	5	Humming an endless aria,
	You surge towards the place where the sun rises,
	Yellow fish swim into the depths of Eastern civilization,
	Reading the legend of the Chinese dragon,
	Listening to the melodious Chinese aria.

    黄河
    袁冬青
    一你的怒吼是振奋人心的进行曲把我们唱成冲浪的鱼跳过龙门的是鱼跳不过龙门的也是鱼
    二你浇灌的土地长出一片片金黄的小麦哪一粒不藏着一种意境？！鱼游进去嚼香中国面包
    三越流越浑越流越醇盘古酿造的酒灌醉了太白写下许多醉人的诗灌醉了老杜茅屋为秋风所破都不知道郦道元的《水经注》至今还满是酒味
    四黄封皮的中国版本拉纤者是书里的插图记载下一个个在浪尖上跋涉的梦一篇睡了很久的神话每条黄肤色的鱼都在读谁读懂了就是一个孝子
    五哼着久久不息的绝唱向太阳升起的地方奔腾黄色鱼游进东方文明史的深层读中国龙的传说听富有神韵的中国咏叹
