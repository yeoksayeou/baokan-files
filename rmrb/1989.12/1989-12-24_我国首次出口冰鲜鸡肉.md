    China's first export of chilled chicken meat was successfully delivered to Osaka, Japan. The 6-ton shipment of chilled chicken meat, produced by Shanghai Da Jiang Limited Company's meat processing plant, arrived in Japan on December 22nd. This marks a historic milestone in China's poultry industry.

    Unlike frozen chicken meat, chilled chicken meat must be kept at a temperature between -0.6 and -0.8 degrees Celsius after slaughter and processing to maintain its freshness. Previously, due to limitations in equipment and processing technology, China could only export frozen chickens or frozen chicken meat. This batch of chilled chicken meat from Shanghai Da Jiang Limited Company was transported by the "Jian Zhen" ship and took three days at sea. According to feedback from Japanese customers, the chilled chicken meat was "fresh, with a bright color, good elasticity, normal temperature, and excellent quality."

    我国首次出口冰鲜鸡肉
    新华社上海12月22日电　（记者孙洪祥）由上海大江有限公司肉食品厂生产的6吨未经速冻的冰鲜鸡肉于日前运抵日本大阪，开创了我国出口冰鲜鸡肉的历史。
    冰鲜鸡肉不同于速冻的冻鸡肉。它要求肉鸡在宰杀加工后处于零下0.6至0.8摄氏度，保持鸡肉原有的新鲜度。以往，我国因受设备和加工技术的限制，只能出口冻鸡或冻鸡肉。上海大江有限公司这批冰鲜鸡肉是由“鉴真”轮运抵日本的，在海上历时三天之久。据日方客商来电反映，这些冰鲜鸡肉“鲜度良好，色泽光亮，有弹性，温度正常，品质优良”。
