Observation Platform:

Recently, we conducted an investigation into the socially run medical services in six townships of our county, including Yongzhong, Chaihu, and Jiukou. We discovered that as healthcare reform deepens, socially run medical services have also developed, which has been convenient for the public and supplemented the shortcomings of state-run medical institutions. However, there are also many problems.

Unlicensed practice and fraud. Out of the 37 medical institutions run by enterprises and organizations we investigated, 19 have not been approved or issued certificates by the health authorities. Of the 70 individual practitioners, 33 do not have medical practice licenses. Particularly, individual practitioners lack necessary medical facilities and equipment, and some even lack medical skills.

Illegal production of drugs, sale of counterfeit and substandard drugs, and non-therapeutic products. In the 49 medical units inspected in Yongzhong Township, 47 types of counterfeit drugs and 95 types of substandard drugs were found.

Inaccurate pricing and arbitrary charges. Out of the 49 socially run medical units investigated in Yongzhong Township, only 21 have patient registrations, 33 have prescriptions for dispensing medicines, 16 have receipts for charges, and only 11 have pricing standards, with an accuracy rate of less than 30%.

Poor equipment, low technical standards, and frequent medical accidents. There are 187 socially run medical practitioners in the Yongzhong area, of whom 59 are non-medical personnel, accounting for 32.6%. Eleven individual practitioners have no education or professional titles and cannot even distinguish between genuine and counterfeit common Chinese medicines, yet they practice medicine and take on apprentices. These socially run medical units and personnel have very poor medical facilities, lacking even necessary equipment, and their technical level is low, leading to frequent accidents. Since last year, there have been 11 medical accidents involving individual practitioners in Chaihu Township, resulting in one death and two disabilities.

The impact of socially run medical services has disrupted the "three-tier medical network," causing it to break down. The "three-tier medical network" has long played a good role. However, facing the wave of socially run medical services, village doctors have set up their own practices, operated individually, and found ways to make money from practicing medicine, unwilling to undertake preventive and health care tasks, making it impossible to implement preventive health care work.

### 社会办医　方便群众  违法从业　令人堪忧

    社会办医　方便群众
    违法从业　令人堪忧
    湖北省钟祥县县委政研室陈宗武、王忠、县卫生局张翼乾、游鹏来信：最近，我们对我县郢中、柴湖、旧口等六个镇的社会办医情况进行调查发现，随着卫生改革的深入开展，社会办医也相应得到发展，这方便了群众，补充了国家医疗机构之不足，但也存在不少问题。
    无证行医，骗人钱财。我们调查37个企事业单位办的医疗机构中，有19个未经卫生主管部门的审批发证；70个个体开业医有33个未办行医许可证，特别是个体开业医无必需的医疗设施、器械，甚至无医疗技术。
    非法自制药品，兜售假劣药品及非治疗性商品。在郢中镇检查的49个医疗单位，就发现假药47种，劣药95种。
    划价不准，乱收费。仅郢中镇所调查的49个社会办医单位，看病有登记的只有21个，发药有处方的33个，收费有凭证的16个，有收费标准的只有11个，其划价准确率在30％以下。
    设备简陋，技术低劣，医疗事故时有发生。郢中地区社会从医人员共187人，其中非卫生技术人员就有59人，占32.6％；11名个体行医者均无学历、无职称，有几人连常用中药真伪都区分不开，却在行医带学徒。这些社会办医的单位和人员的医疗设施十分简陋，连必需的器械也没有，而且技术水平低，以致事故屡有发生。去年以来，柴湖镇个体行医者就发生医疗事故11起，因事故死亡1人，致残2人。
    社会办医的冲击波使“三级医疗网”受到冲击，以致破裂。“三级医疗网”长期以来起到了很好的作用。但是面对社会办医浪潮，乡村医生纷纷自立门户，个体开业，想方设法行医赚钱，不愿承担预防、保健任务，致使预防保健工作无法落实。
