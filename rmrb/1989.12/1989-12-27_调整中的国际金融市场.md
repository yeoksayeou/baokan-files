The international financial market experienced several fluctuations in 1989, but no major upheavals occurred. The dollar remained stable with a slight upward trend, while the stock market continued to adjust. Economists predict that the Western economy may still lack momentum in the coming year, but it is unlikely to experience a recession. This will likely lead to increased volatility in the financial market, with more factors working against the dollar, making its position weaker than it was in 1989.

Changes in the Capital Market

The growth of the world economy and the expansion of trade activities have increased the demand for funds, driving the scale of capital market borrowing to expand. In recent years, there have been changes in the direction of borrowing currencies in the international financial market. The share of the U.S. dollar has decreased. According to statistics from the Bank for International Settlements, between 1983 and 1988, the share of the U.S. dollar in the debt of 24 industrialized countries and regions dropped from 75.7% to 57.8%, while the share of the Deutsche Mark rose from 6.4% to 10.1%, and the share of the Japanese yen rose from 3.4% to 10.7%. Notably, the major borrowers in the capital market are still industrialized countries. In the first quarter of this year, industrialized countries borrowed $113.2 billion, accounting for 94.3% of the total borrowing, while developing countries borrowed only $2.4 billion, accounting for just 2%. Looking at the overall flow of funds, in recent years, developing countries have repaid more in principal and interest on their external debts than they have borrowed, resulting in a reverse flow of funds.

Since the 1980s, the international capital market has seen a trend towards securitization of fundraising, where fund-seekers tend to raise funds directly from the public by issuing various debt securities, including bonds, stocks, and deposit certificates, rather than borrowing from banks through indirect financing. However, after the stock market crash in October 1987, the securities market has been volatile, with increased risks. Additionally, Western banks, in order to overcome the weaknesses of syndicated loans, have created new business products to attract customers. Therefore, syndicated loans have regained popularity, but the trend towards securitization of fundraising remains strong.

An Active but Fragile Stock Market

This year, the Western stock market continued to rise. On August 24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 2734.64 points, surpassing the previous high before the market crash by 12.22 points. Stock price indices in Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, and other cities also set new records.

The bullish trend in the Western stock market is primarily due to the economy's continued low-speed growth, which has led to increased corporate profits. Additionally, the trend of corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United States and Western Europe has driven up stock prices. Furthermore, the U.S. dollar's exchange rate, influenced by various factors, has shown a short-term upward trend and long-term stability, stimulating overseas investors' interest in investing in dollar-denominated assets. However, it should be noted that the foundation for the recovery of the Western stock market is fragile, with frequent fluctuations and the possibility of a significant drop at any time.

Seeking Development Amidst Turbulence

After several years of development, the momentum of the Western economy has waned, and the growth rate is expected to slow further in 1990. However, there are currently no signs of an imminent recession.

The international financial market is a reflection of the world economy, constrained by it and, in turn, influencing its development. Given that the overall economic and financial landscape in the West will not undergo substantial changes, the international capital market will not experience dramatic shifts. Due to the internationalization of production, markets, and capital, the international capital market will continue to develop, with borrowing activities expanding. However, the slowing economic growth rate will affect the demand for funds. Additionally, the instability of interest rates and exchange rates will be a factor limiting the expansion of the capital market. The competition in the international capital market and the increasing risks associated with interest rates and exchange rates will drive both borrowers and lenders to actively create new financial instruments, continuously improving fundraising techniques. Some traditional financial instruments and methods, after being improved, will be revalued and utilized. Meanwhile, the original boundaries of financial business operations, industry boundaries, and service scope are becoming increasingly blurred. New competitors are emerging, and various forms of competition are intensifying, which will drive the financial market towards further globalization and integration.

The Western stock market is still in the process of adjustment. The prosperity and boom of the global stock market will continue, but fluctuations, and even significant short-term fluctuations, are inevitable due to some temporary and incidental factors. Although factors supporting the stability of the U.S. dollar still exist and will continue to do so, factors working against the dollar are also developing.

Frequent fluctuations are a characteristic of the world economy and international financial situation. Of course, the scope and degree of these fluctuations vary at different times and in different countries and regions. In recent years, Western countries have been actively adjusting and seeking stable economic and financial development. It is expected that the world economy and international financial market will continue to experience turbulence in 1990. They will seek to remove obstacles amidst this turbulence, delay a recession, and strive for development.

### 调整中的国际金融市场

    调整中的国际金融市场
    张德宝
    1989年西方经济发展速度放慢，金融市场曾几度风云，但未发生大的动荡，美元稳中有升，股市仍处在调整的过程中。经济学家预计，明年西方经济可能仍无起色，但尚不至于出现衰退。受此影响，金融市场的动荡可能有所扩大，不利于美元的因素将更加突出，美元的地位会弱于1989年。
    资本市场的变化
    世界经济的增长，贸易活动的扩大，增加了对资金的需求，由此推动了资本市场借贷规模的扩大。
    近年来国际资金市场上借贷货币的方向有所变化，美元比重有所下降。据国际清算银行统计，在1983——1988年期间，24个工业国家和地区的债权中，美元从75.7％降到57.8％，西德马克从6.4％上升到10.1％，日元从3.4％上升到10.7％。值得注意的是资本市场上的借款大户仍是工业国。今年一季度工业国的借款额为1132亿美元，占全部借款额的94.3％，而发展中国家仅为24亿美元，所占比重仅为2％。从整个资金流动情况看，近几年发展中国家偿还外债本息超过其所获得的贷款，出现资金倒流现象。
    80年代以来，国际资本市场出现了筹资证券化的趋势，即资金需求者倾向于通过发行各种债务性证券包括债券，股票、存款证等，直接向公众筹集资金，而不是采取向银行借取公众存款的间接融资方式。但1987年10月西方股市暴跌后，整个证券市场动荡不定，风险增加，另外西方银行为了克服银团贷款本身的弱点，创造了新的业务品种吸引客户，因此，银团贷款重新受到青睐，但筹资证券化仍方兴未艾。
    活跃而又脆弱的股票市场
    今年以来，西方股市继续挺升，8月24日，纽约道—琼斯工业平均指数达到创纪录的2734.64点，比股市暴跌前的最高点还高12.22点。法兰克福、巴黎、苏黎世等地的股价指数也创下了新的纪录。
    西方股市行情看涨，首先是因为经济仍处于持续低速增长的状态，企业利润上升。其次，美国和西欧国内企业兼并之风盛行，推动股价上扬。再者，今年美元汇价在多种因素的支配下，呈现短期趋升，长期看稳的现象，刺激了海外投资者投资美元资产的积极性。应该看到，西方股市回升的基础是比较脆弱的，波动是经常的，而且随时再度大幅下跌的可能性也难以排除。
    在动荡中寻求发展
    经过这几年的发展，西方经济增长已缺乏后劲，1990年西方经济增长速度将进一步放慢。但目前看尚不至出现明显的衰退。
    国际金融市场是世界经济的一个折射点，它受世界经济的制约，反过来又影响世界经济的发展。由于整个西方经济格局和经济金融态势不会出现实质性变化，国际资本市场也不会出现戏剧性变化。由于生产国、市场和资本的国际化，国际资本市场将进一步发展，国际资本市场的借贷活动进一步扩大。但由于经济增长速度放慢，因此对资金的需求会受到影响。另外，利率和汇率的不稳定性又是资本市场扩大的一个遏制因素。国际资本市场上的竞争及利率、汇率风险的扩大，促使借贷双方都在积极创造新型的金融工具，筹资技巧不断提高，一些传统的金融工具和方式经过改进后会重新受到重视和利用。同时，金融业务原有的经营地区界限、行业界限、服务范围界限已日益模糊。新的竞争对手不断涌现，各种形式的竞争日益加剧，也将使金融市场继续向全球化一体化方向发展。
    西方股市仍处在调整中，全球的股市兴旺与繁荣还会持续下去，但受一些临时性偶发性因素的影响，股市的波动，甚至短期内出现较大的波动是难免的。尽管有利于美元的因素仍然存在并将继续支持美元趋稳，但对美元的不利因素也在不断发展。
      经常性的动荡是世界经济和国际金融形势的一个特点，当然在不同时期、不同国家和地区，这种动荡波及的范围和程度是不尽相同的，近几年来，西方国家也在积极进行调整，寻求经济金融平稳发展的药方。1990年世界经济和国际金融市场预计仍将处在动荡中。它们将在动荡中寻求消除障碍，进而推迟衰退，谋求发展。
