After the second round of the second China-Japan Go Name Match, Nie Weiping, with a heavy heart, repeatedly mentioned to me that losing is not frightening, what is frightening is having no chance of winning at all. It is not uncommon for professional players to make occasional mistakes or miss fleeting opportunities during a match, but if a player cannot find the opponent's weak point and deliver a decisive blow, that is truly tragic.

After the match, I asked Kobayashi Koichi, "Do you think Ma Xiaochun had any chance of winning in these two rounds?" Kobayashi frankly replied, "My view is no, and Ma Xiaochun also admitted this." This clearly shows that in the Chinese Go community, only Nie Weiping can compete with Japan's top-tier players. Through a series of major international competitions in recent years, it can be seen that China's young generation of players is still a few steps away from the peak. I asked Kobayashi Koichi about this issue, "What do you think is the difference between China's young players and Nie Weiping?" Kobayashi Koichi meaningfully replied, "This is a very subtle question, but in my opinion, it mainly lies in mental toughness. To become a top-tier player, having superior skills is not enough."

In several rounds of the China-Japan Go League, China's young players have performed impressively, leading many to optimistically believe that Chinese and Japanese Go have entered an era of full-scale competition. However, some insightful individuals in China's Go community believe that although Chinese Go has made significant strides since the 1980s, a serious analysis shows that whether in overall strength or in the number of high-level players, we are still at a disadvantage. During the two days of the competition, the entire Chinese Go team, led by head coach Nie Weiping, came to the venue every day to provide on-site commentary and analysis, which is quite rare. The consecutive losses in the eight rounds of the two China-Japan Name Matches and the Tianyuan Tournament have heightened the sense of crisis in China's Go community, making them feel the urgent need to catch up.

    中日围棋名人战的启示
    中信杯第二届中日围棋名人战第二盘赛后，聂卫平心情沉重地几次向我提到，输并不可怕，可怕的是一点儿胜的机会都没有。比赛时出现偶然的疏忽或没有抓住稍纵即逝的战机，这在职业棋手中并不少见，但一个棋手若不能找出对方的致命处并给以有力的一击，这才是真正的悲哀。
    比赛结束后我问小林光一，你觉得马晓春这两盘比赛有胜的可能吗？小林坦率地说，我的看法是没有，马晓春对此也予以承认。这清楚地表明，中国围棋界，能与日本超一流棋手相抗衡的仅有聂卫平一人。通过近几年来一系列重大的国际比赛，可以看出，中国年轻的一代棋手距离峰巅，还差几步。我就此问题询问过小林光一，你认为中国年轻棋手与聂卫平的差距究竟在哪里？小林光一意味深长地回答，这是一个很微妙的问题，但依我看主要还是精神顽强这一点上。要想成为超一流棋手，仅仅有高超的棋艺还是不够的。
    在几届中日围棋擂台赛上，中国年轻棋手都有不俗的表现，于是不少人乐观地认为，中日围棋已进入全面抗衡的时代。但是我国棋界有识之士却认为，尽管80年代以来中国围棋连迈了几大步，但认真分析起来，无论从总体实力上还是从高水平棋手人数上，我们仍然处于下风。在两天比赛中，中国围棋队的全体队员在总教练聂卫平的带领下，每天均来到赛场，进行现场讲解、拆棋，这也是不多见的。连续两届中日名人战、天元赛的8盘棋，中国棋手均失利，这加迫了我国围棋界的危机感，切实感到要努力追赶。　　　　本报记者　陈　昭
