By December 5th, Shougang had completed its annual production plan for iron, steel, and steel products 26 days ahead of schedule. A number of key technical and economic indicators reached historic highs.

Throughout the year, Shougang faced challenges with funding and raw materials. However, the workers united in thought, strictly implemented the contract system, and worked tirelessly. They demonstrated a firm belief in reform, a strong sense of ownership, and a broad perspective. Workers in the steelmaking system found ways to increase the use of scrap steel, reduce iron consumption, and boost production. The rolling system focused on improving operating rates, yield rates, and quality rates. Notably, the Second Wire Rod Mill exceeded its historical production levels for four consecutive months, surpassing the design capacity of the high-speed wire rod rolling mill. They also increased the variety of steel products that met market demands. Additionally, steel products entered the international market. By December 5th, pig iron production reached 300 million tons, steel production reached 342 million tons, and steel product production reached 301 million tons, all completing the national production tasks ahead of schedule.
