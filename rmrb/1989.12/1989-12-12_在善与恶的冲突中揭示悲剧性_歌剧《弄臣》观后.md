Recently, the renowned opera "Rigoletto" by Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi was successfully performed in Nanjing by the Jiangsu Provincial Song and Dance Troupe in collaboration with the Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Zhou Xiaoyan Opera Center. This is a noteworthy event in the development of opera in China and a significant addition to our opera culture.

Based on Victor Hugo's "Le Roi s'amuse," "Rigoletto" is one of the most moving tragedies in the world of opera. It sharply criticizes and exposes the highest representatives of feudal power, pointing out that the debauchery and bestial greed of the Duke of Mantua are the true sources of human tragedy. It also brings two completely different ordinary characters, Rigoletto and his daughter Gilda, to the center of the opera stage, expressing deep sympathy for their misfortunes. The entire opera is filled with sharp dramatic conflicts, vivid character portrayals, and music rich in romantic lyricism, making it a classic work with profound artistic and intellectual depth, as well as high technical difficulty in performance.

The opera artists from Jiangsu and Shanghai overcame numerous challenges to successfully bring "Rigoletto" to the Chinese opera stage for the first time. In their interpretation and revelation of the opera's tragic content, and in their portrayal of the main characters, the performance has developed its own unique style.

Undoubtedly, Rigoletto is the central figure of the tragic events, the one who bears the brunt of the tragic consequences, and the primary carrier of the opera's tragic themes. To portray such a complex character—ugly in appearance, intricate in personality, and torn between good and evil—is a daunting task for a young baritone singer like Lei Yan. However, Lei Yan's singing in "Rigoletto" is powerful, resonant, and rich in timbre, with smooth breath control, clear diction, precise vocal shaping, and nuanced emotional expression. In terms of performance, he remains faithful to the original character's depth, focusing on the tragic nature of his social status—a distorted and lost humanity under the weight of power, and a tragic fate determined by the conflict between good and evil. Two moments in his performance left a deep impression on me: one in the second act, when Montarone sings the ominous, persistent curse theme, Lei Yan's face suddenly shows extreme terror, accompanied by a sharp contraction of his body, thus succinctly and vividly revealing the profound impact of the curse on the character's inner self; the other in the third act, where Lei Yan transitions from casually inquiring about his daughter's whereabouts upon entering, to angrily denouncing the ministers' banditry, then from desperately pleading for Gilda's return, to turning from sorrow to joy, and then back to anger upon seeing his daughter. These complex and varied emotional states are depicted with remarkable subtlety and authenticity, and the shifts in mood are natural and layered.

Unlike the tragic figure of Rigoletto, who ends up being devoured by the very beast he served, Gilda's tragic essence lies elsewhere. She is pure, filled with romantic and poetic passion for love, symbolizing beauty and goodness. The fact that she is deceived, violated, and ultimately destroyed mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy and murderous nature of the feudal rulers regarding love. Wang Hong's portrayal of Gilda is pure and natural, effortless. She captures the essential traits of Gilda's tragic character—innocence, sanctity, kindness, and childlike innocence—with a clear and transparent vocal timbre. Her artistic rendition is delicate and moving, with elegant demeanor, dignified bearing, and polished body language, emphasizing the purity and madness of the character's pursuit of love. All of this is fully realized in Gilda's pivotal scene in the second act. Wang Hong's performance convincingly demonstrates that Gilda dies not only from the Duke's deception but also from her own illusions, from her overly pure and mad pursuit of a deceitful love.

Naturally, the Duke is the representative of the evil forces in the entire opera, but Gu Xin's portrayal of this role completely avoids simplistic, caricatured, and cartoonish treatments. Instead, he adheres to the original work's tone, imbuing the character with a charming, romantic, and handsome demeanor, using his outward beauty to contrast his inner ugliness. Vocally, according to the character's needs, Gu Xin's singing is both luxurious and ethereal, brimming with rich lyrical tones. When the Duke sings his delusions of love to Gilda and then to Maddalena, Gu Xin's performance and singing lack false emotions and exaggerated hints, even carrying a certain sincerity and passion. The more genuinely and movingly he sings, the more sincere and passionate he appears, the more Gilda and Maddalena are bewitched by these deceitful words, and the more hypocritical and despicable the character appears to the audience. Of course, achieving such artistic effects is first and foremost due to the success of the original work, and also to Gu Xin's successful creation of this role.

Additionally, the performance's choral and ensemble singing are also noteworthy. For example, the duet between Rigoletto and Gilda in the second act, the men's chorus "Softly, softly" by the courtiers, and the famous quartet in the fourth act, all feature balanced and clear vocal parts, rich and harmonious overall sound, showcasing the troupe's diligent training and strong artistic foundation.

    在善与恶的冲突中揭示悲剧性
    歌剧《弄臣》观后
    居其宏
    最近，意大利作曲家威尔第的著名歌剧《弄臣》由江苏省歌舞剧院和上海音乐学院周小燕歌剧中心合作在南京演出并获得成功，是我国歌剧事业和歌剧生活中一件值得庆贺的事情。
    根据法国作家维克多·雨果的《国王行乐》改编的歌剧《弄臣》，是世界歌剧宝库中震撼人心的悲剧之一。它把批判和揭露的锋芒直指封建权力的最高代表者，指出曼图亚公爵的荒淫无耻和兽性的贪婪是造成人类悲剧的真正根源；它把两个全然不同的普通人形象——黎戈莱托和他的女儿吉尔达推向歌剧舞台的中心，对于他们的不幸遭际寄予深切的同情。全剧戏剧冲突尖锐，人物性格鲜明，音乐充满浪漫主义的抒情性，是一出思想艺术内涵深刻、上演技术难度很大的经典性作品。
    江苏与上海两地的歌剧艺术家克服了重重困难，终于第一次将《弄臣》成功地搬上了我国歌剧舞台。在对作品悲剧内涵的理解和揭示上，在几个主要人物的性格刻画方面，《弄臣》的演出形成了自己的特色。
    毫无疑问，黎戈莱托是整个悲剧事件的中心、悲剧后果的最大承担者和悲剧内涵的主要载体。要塑造好这样一个外貌丑陋、性格复杂、内心充满善恶冲突的艺术形象，对于年轻的男中音歌唱家雷岩说来，其难度可想而知。然而雷岩在《弄臣》中的演唱声音雄浑、厚实而富于共鸣，气息流畅，吐字清晰，声音造型准确，感情表达细腻而传神。从表演上说，他忠于原作赋予角色的内涵，着力刻画角色社会地位所决定的悲剧性格——一种在权力重压下人性的扭曲、失落及由善恶冲突所决定的悲剧命运。他的表演有两处给我印象尤深：一处在第二幕，当蒙特罗内唱出那不祥的固执的诅咒主题时，他的脸上突然现出极度惊恐的神色，辅以形体动作的猛一收缩，从而简洁而鲜明地揭示出诅咒主题在角色内心深处所引起的巨大震撼；另一处在第三幕，雷岩把角色从一登场时伪装若无其事地探听女儿下落，到愤怒谴责大臣们的强盗行径；继而从苦苦哀求众人归还吉尔达，到见到女儿后转悲为喜、复又转喜为怒等一系列复杂多变的情感状态揭示得相当细致真实，情绪的转换自然而且富于层次感。
    与弄臣这个为虎作伥终又为虎所食的悲剧形象不同，吉尔达形象的悲剧性内涵另有所寄。她纯洁，对爱情充满幻想与诗意的激情，是美与善的象征。她的被欺骗、被蹂躏和最终被毁灭的事实，无情揭露了封建统治者关于爱的虚伪性及其杀人本质。吉尔达的扮演者王虹演来纯朴自然、得心应手。她紧紧抓住吉尔达悲剧性格的基本特点——纯真、圣洁、善良、天真无邪，以纯净透明的声音造型，艺术处理上十分细腻而动人的演唱，高雅的风度、端庄的气质和洗练的形体语言，着力刻画角色爱情追求的纯与痴；而这一切在吉尔达的重场戏第二幕中得到了淋漓尽致的表现。王虹以自己的表演令人信服地证明，吉尔达不仅死于公爵的欺骗，而且也死于自己心灵的幻影，死于对那种骗人爱情过“纯”过“痴”的追求。
      自然，公爵是全剧恶势力的代表人物，但顾欣扮演这个角色却全然摈弃那种简单化脸谱化漫画化的处理手法，而是遵循原作所规定的基调，以“纪实风格”赋予角色以风流多情潇洒英俊的气质，用表面的俊美来反衬其内心世界的丑恶。从声乐上说，根据角色创造的需要，顾欣的演唱是华丽而又飘逸
  的，洋溢着浓烈的抒情格调。当公爵对着吉尔达、继而对着玛达琳娜唱着关于爱的呓语时，顾欣的表演与演唱没有虚情假意和过分夸张的暗示，甚至还带着某种真诚而热烈的情感；而他愈唱得真切动人，愈显出坦诚热
  烈，吉尔达和玛达琳娜愈为这种骗人的鬼话所迷醉，这个角色在观众眼中便愈虚伪，愈令人厌恶。当然，能取得这样的艺术效果，首先是原作的成功，同时也是顾欣对这个角色创造的成功。
      此外，演出在合唱和重唱方面的成绩也颇为引人注目。例如第二幕黎戈莱托与吉尔达的二重唱，大臣们的男声合唱《轻点，轻点》以及第四幕那首举世闻名的四重唱等，声部处理均衡清晰，综合音响丰满谐和，显出剧团平时训练的刻苦和艺术功底的不弱。
