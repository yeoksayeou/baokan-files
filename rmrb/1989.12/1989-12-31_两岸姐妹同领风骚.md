At the end of the year, the Asian Cup women's football tournament in Hong Kong created a small sensation. After ten days of intense competition among eight teams from Asia, the young women from both sides of the Taiwan Strait shared the spotlight. Hong Kong football fans focused their attention on these two teams. Local newspapers extensively reported on the situation of the two teams, with pictures and text, and many players became favorites among fans. This Asian Women's Football Cup event caused a greater sensation and enthusiasm than ever before. Experts believe this is related to the increasing popularity and acceptance of women's football.

Girls playing football show the same fighting spirit as men during matches. Currently, in West Germany, there are more than 2,000 women's football teams with over 400,000 players. The English Women's Football Association has 7,000 registered players. The president of the Argentine Women's Football Association said that women in their country are beginning to be passionate about football.

In Asia, the Chinese women's football team is a rising star. The Chinese team started participating from the sixth edition and won the Asian Cup in its debut. At that time, the Taiwan Mulan team, which had won the championship in the second, third, and fourth editions, did not participate. This time, the Chinese Taipei team returned to the Asian Women's Football Cup, and the sisters from both sides of the Taiwan Strait performed together in Hong Kong, creating a sensation even before the performance.

The women's football teams from both sides of the Taiwan Strait met in Hong Kong this time, showing camaraderie, both as opponents and as mutual encouragers. Liu Runze, the founder of the Mulan women's football team, said that although there were opportunities to meet in the past, they did not actively communicate, but this time the coaches were able to talk freely and exchange skills. When the Taipei team first saw the mainland team enter the Mong Kok Stadium, they enthusiastically applauded. During the interval of the Taipei team's match against another country, the Chinese team's coach also went over to encourage them. Mr. Liu said, "We cherish the concern from our motherland."

The Mulan women's football team was once a "golden nameplate" in Taiwan's sports world. This time, the Taipei team came to Hong Kong a week early for warm-up training and recalled three veteran players, showing their clear intention to win the championship. However, they lost both matches to the mainland team by one goal. The Taipei team members expressed "admitting defeat," saying that this time the ranking was completely based on strength.

Coach Gao Yong of the Taipei team said that in Taiwan, this sport has been developed for a long time, and people no longer look at women's football players with strange eyes. However, since most of the players are students from various schools and are not professional players, they have to face academic pressure and future career issues. He said that the Taipei team will strive to participate in the Women's World Cup.

After winning the Asian Cup consecutively, the next goal for the Chinese team is the first Women's World Cup to be held in Guangdong in 1991. The International Football Federation also plans to include women's football in the 1996 Olympic Games. Team leader Yang Xiuwu said that the level of Chinese women's football has improved rapidly in recent years, but since it is not included in the national games, the development of women's football has been affected to some extent.

Hearing the sound of war drums and thinking of good generals, some football figures hope to be prepared in advance. Once women's football is included as an official event in the Olympic Games, China will have more opportunities.

    两岸姐妹同领风骚
    本报记者　连锦添
    岁末，亚洲杯女足赛在香港绿茵场掀起一个小高潮。亚洲8支娘子军经过十几天的激烈角逐，海峡两岸中国姑娘同领风骚。香港球迷的关注焦点，正是这两强的表现。当地报纸大篇幅报道两个队情况，图文并茂，许多队员成为球迷喜爱的人物。亚洲女足赛此次盛举，造成的轰动和热情都超过以往。行家认为，这与女子足球逐渐普及，接受者增加有关。
    女孩子踢足球，比赛时那份拚劲一点不比须眉逊色。目前在西德，有2000多支女足队，队员超过40万。英格兰女子足总有7000名注册球员。阿根廷女子足总主席说，他们国家妇女开始陷入足球狂热。
    亚洲女足运动，中国队为后起之秀。中国队从第六届才开始参加，便一举夺得亚洲杯。当时，蝉联第二、三、四届亚洲冠军的台湾木兰队未参加。这次中国台北队重返亚洲女足赛，海峡两岸姐妹同场献技，在香港可谓“未演出先轰动”。
    海峡两岸女足此次在香港相遇，情同手足，既是对手，又互相鼓励。台湾木兰队创始人刘润泽先生说，过去虽然有机会碰面，都未主动沟通，而这次教练们得以畅谈，交流技艺。台北队在旺角球场初见大陆队进场，热烈鼓掌迎接。台北队与别国交锋的中间休息时间，中国队教练也特地过去鼓励。刘先生说，我们珍惜来自祖国的关怀。
    木兰女足曾是台湾体坛一块“金字招牌”。这次台北队不惜提前一周来港热身，并召回三名老将，夺标之志不言而喻。结果，两战都输给大陆队一球。台北队队员表示“口服心服”，这次完全是以实力排座次。
    台北队教练高庸表示，在台湾，这项运动开展较早，人们早已不对女足队员投以奇异目光。不过由于队员多为各校学生，非职业球手，要面对学业压力和将来出路问题。他表示，台北队将争取参加世界杯女足赛。
    蝉联亚洲杯后，中国队的下一个努力目标是1991年在广东举行的第一届世界杯女足赛。国际足联还计划将女足列入1996年奥运会项目。中国队领队杨秀武说，中国女足近几年水平提高较快，但由于未被列入全运会比赛项目，女足发展也受到一些影响。
    闻战鼓而思良将，部分足坛人士希望未雨绸缪，女足一旦列为奥运会正式项目，中国可多几分机会。
