In May 1988, when 24 high school students boarded a plane to Japan, the send-off crowd had mixed reactions—some were worried, some were skeptical, and others thought they were lucky. These students were from the third year of the electronics vacuum specialty at Beijing Jiangtai Road Middle School. They had already been hired by Beijing Matsushita Color Picture Tube Factory and were sent to Matsushita Factory in Japan for a six-month internship at the company's expense. According to the regulations, teachers were not allowed to accompany them.

"Will this work?" The public security and foreign affairs departments, thinking of those lively high school students without any teachers to supervise, were a bit uneasy. They instructed the school leaders: "Strive to avoid accidents or minimize them." The embassy staff said: "If they have seven or eight incidents, that would be good; don't expect too much."

At that moment, only their teachers were confident. During the send-off, there was no need for lengthy speeches or repeated instructions; everything had been said countless times over the past three years. They knew their students best and believed that the students would bring honor to the country.

To everyone's surprise

Upon arriving in Japan, the 24 students, along with technical personnel from Beijing Matsushita Factory, were dispersed across nearly 10 factories in and around Tokyo and Osaka. Among the more than 200 dispatched personnel, they were the youngest.

Going to Japan for an internship meant enduring hardship and toil. Although the students had prepared mentally before leaving, they were still a group of inexperienced high school students. As everyone knows, the labor of contemporary high school students is at most limited to major clean-ups. However, the labor intensity at Matsushita Factory in Japan is high, with high speed and fast pace. Standing for 8 hours of work, with 15 minutes of rest in the morning and afternoon. In the first two weeks of the internship, even the male students were so exhausted that they wanted to kneel down and rest. After work, they could barely get into bed. It was at this moment that they realized that China's modernization and achieving a moderately prosperous society was not just empty talk, but required everyone to work diligently like operating on an assembly line.

"To bring honor to the country, no matter how tired, we must persevere!" The students encouraged each other. Liu Hongquan's internship position was at the low-temperature melting furnace, where the working environment temperature was over 43°C. The assembly line moved once every minute, and he had to complete his task within that time. Once, he fainted during the intense work, but after receiving some simple treatment at the clinic, he immediately returned to his post. Li Yuanju was injured in the foot by an explosion at the exhaust furnace, and after the doctor stitched up three stitches, he immediately returned to work. In the early stages of the internship, the students first passed the tests of endurance, intensity, and willpower.

Yang Lixin's internship position was cathode inspection, which required comprehensive technical skills and high work intensity. The task required 4 actions in 6 seconds and the ability to identify over 30 types of defects. According to the Japanese side, this type of work requires Japanese workers to be trained for half a year to a year, but Yang Lixin mastered it in just over two months, with a very low error rate, meeting the Japanese standards. Li Weihong and Hu Yonghong, two female students, interned at the cathode product factory. During the day, they worked, and at night, they translated technical materials and wrote internship diaries. In the small-scale production experiment conducted in the last month of the internship, their output and quality reached the level of Japanese workers. The Japanese factory manager, Tuan Ye, praised: "Your speed has surpassed our workers."

The Japanese factory managers who accepted the students for internships said: "At first, we saw a group of students and lacked confidence, but we didn't expect them to later reach our level. It was truly beyond our expectations."

During the six-month internship, the students did not have any incidents of violating diplomatic regulations. The person in charge of the team said: "These students are law-abiding and reliable. It seems that they were strictly managed and had high standards during their school days, with a good foundation."

Qiu Yan Sheng became a good worker

He is Qiu Yan Sheng. In his own words, "When I entered school, I was a bad kid, but now I've changed and become a good worker."

His internship position was inspecting the quality of the cathode cover. The factory used cathode covers supplied by an external factory, which required quality inspection of incoming components. The Japanese master only taught the inspection method and did not teach the correction technique. Qiu used his rest time to translate technical materials with his classmates and learned the correction technique. Once, he found that there were many defective cathode covers, and he corrected them while inspecting, reporting the quality issues to his superiors. The factory manager brought technical personnel to the site for an investigation and saw that the inspected cathode covers had no quality issues. They thought that Qiu Yan Sheng was deliberately causing trouble. Qiu explained, "These are the ones I just corrected." The manager did not believe him and casually took a correction pen from the technician, made a few holes in a cathode cover behind Qiu's back, and handed it to him. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, he skillfully found the problem and corrected it. He also picked out a few cathode covers with quality issues from those that had not been inspected. The manager admitted, "The Chinese intern I first met is you. Your hands are very skilled."

It was this Qiu Yan Sheng who shocked the Japanese side. He was originally a typical underachiever. After graduating from junior high school, he worked as a temporary worker for a year before being admitted to Jiangtai Road Middle School. His admission score was the lowest, and he wore slippers and had yellowed fingers from smoking when he reported. In the first week of school, he skipped class to visit a friend who was under juvenile supervision and argued with the teacher, acting arrogantly. The principal, vice-principal, and class teacher of Jiangtai Road Middle School patiently helped him, and after several attempts, he gradually improved. In his senior year, he joined the Communist Youth League, and his academic performance improved. He stood out during his overseas internship and became a technical backbone after returning to the country.

Focusing on improving quality

Jiangtai Road Middle School, located at the junction of urban and rural areas, has poor educational conditions and student backgrounds. Take this batch of vocational high school students, for example; they were all leftovers from other schools. At that time, the students did not understand their future work, but the teachers knew that some of the students would work in joint ventures, facing "low entry, high exit." The school's training task was very arduous.

According to the requirements of the employing unit, the school's training goals focused on improving the quality of workers. To this end, they implemented a credit system and comprehensively assessed students. Credits included academic credits, conduct credits, physical education credits, bonus points, and penalty points, strictly implementing quantitative management. After graduation, students were mainly recommended based on their credits, and the employing unit selected them based on their credit scores. This batch of students going to Japan for internships accounted for 1/3 of the graduating class and were all students with relatively high credits.

When students entered the school, the school explained the purpose and method of the credit system to everyone, making it clear that only those who developed morally, intellectually, and physically could choose their work preferences. Students with too few credits would not be assigned jobs. Implementing this system was related to the personal interests of every student, and the vast majority of students took it seriously.

The principal of this school believes that students who enter vocational high schools have relatively low admission scores, which is an objective fact. Due to the different educational and teaching conditions of each school, there must be a group of students with poor foundations during the middle school entrance examination. Through three years of vocational high school education, they can be trained to become qualified workers.

Now, these 24 students have become skilled operators at Beijing Matsushita Color Picture Tube Factory. Some have become team leaders, and some have taken on apprentices. They are a group of recognized qualified workers.

    公认的合格劳动者
    ——记北京将台路中学二十四名学生赴日实习
    本报记者　蒋涵箴
    1988年5月，当24名高中生登上飞机东渡日本，送行者议论纷纷，有担忧的、有疑虑的、有说他们赶上好运的……
    这是北京将台路中学电真空专业三年级学生，他们已被北京松下彩色显像管厂录用，此行由日方负担费用，赴日本松下厂实习半年，按规定老师不能随同。
    “这行吗？”公安部门、外事部门一想起那群活蹦乱跳的高中生，也没有老师管，实在有点不放心，他们嘱咐校领导：“力争不出事故或少出事故。”大使馆的同志说：“出七八件事就不错了，别想得那么好。”
    此刻只有他们的老师心中最踏实。送行时，不必多费口舌，不必再三叮嘱，要说的在三年之中都已说过无数遍。他们最了解自己的学生，深信同学们会给祖国争光。
            出乎人们的意料
    来到日本，24名同学随同北京松下厂派出的技术人员分散在东京、大阪及附近地区的近10个工厂实习。200多名派出人员中，就数他们年轻。
    去日本实习是去吃苦、受累，尽管临走之前同学们作了充分的思想准备，可毕竟这是一群从未经过锻炼的中学生。众所周知，当代中学生的劳动充其量只是大扫除。而日本松下厂流水线的劳动强度很大，高速度、快节奏，8小时站立工作，上下午各有15分钟休息。实习刚开始的两周，连男学生都累得直哭，在班上恨不得跪下来休息，下班后连上床都困难。此时此刻他们才明白中国实现现代化，要达到小康水平，决不是一句漂亮的空话，而是要求每一个人像在流水线上作业一样，脚踏实地地干。
      “要给祖国争光，再累也得挺下来！”同学们互相鼓气。刘红全的实习岗位是低温熔点炉，工作环境温度高达43℃以上，流水线每分钟移动一次，在此期间必须完成自己的工序。一次他在紧张的工作中晕倒了，经卫生室做了些简单处理立即上岗。李元举在排气炉实习，管爆炸使脚扎伤，医生给他缝了三针立即返岗。在实习刚开始阶段，同学们首先经受住了耐力、强度和意志的考验。
    杨立新的实习岗位是阴极检验，技术要求全面、工作强度大，6秒钟动作4次，要反映30多种不良现象。据日方介绍，这种工作日本人需培训半年到一年，而杨立新只实习了两个多月就掌握了，失误率极小，达到日方标准。李卫红、呼永红两位女同学在阴架制品厂实习，白天上班，晚上翻译技术资料，写实习日记。在实习的最后一个月进行的小量生产实验中，产量和质量都达到了日本工人的水平。日本厂长团野称赞说：“你们的速度超过了我们的工人。”
    接受学生实习的日本工厂负责人说：“一开始我们看到来了一批学生信心不足，没想到后来都达到了我们的水平，真出乎我们的意料。”
    在半年实习期间，同学们没有出现任何违反外事纪律的现象。带队的负责人说：“这些学生遵纪守法，让人放心。现管是不行的，看来是在校期间管得严，要求高，基础好。”
        仇雁声成了一名好工人
    他叫仇雁声，用他自己的话来说：“我入学时是一个坏孩子，现在嘛变好了，成了一名好工人。”
    他的实习岗位是检验阴罩质量。实习厂所用的阴罩是由外厂供给，需要做入厂元件的质量检验。日本师傅只教了检验方法，没教修正技术。小仇利用休息时间和同学们一起翻译技术资料，学习修正技术。有一次他发现不良阴罩较多，他边检边修正，并把质量问题向上反映。来件工厂厂长带领技术人员到现场调查，看到检验过的阴罩没有质量问题，认为仇雁声故意刁难。小仇解释说：“这些是我刚修正过的。”厂长不信，顺手从技术员那儿拿来修正笔，背着小仇把一个阴罩捅了几个洞后交给了他。他在众目睽睽之下熟练地找出问题并修正好，还从未经检验的阴罩里挑出几个质量有问题的，这位厂长心服地说：“中国实习生我最早认识的是你，你的手很巧。”
    就是这位使日方震惊的仇雁声，原是个典型的后进生。他初中毕业当了一年临时工后考上将台路中学，入学分数是最低的，报到时穿拖鞋，手指被烟熏得蜡黄。开学第一周就因去看望被少管的朋友而旷课，和老师顶撞，态度蛮横。将台路中学的校长、主任、班主任耐心地帮助他，几经反复，逐渐有了进步，高三时入了团，学习成绩也上来了，出国实习表现突出，回国上岗成为技术骨干。
            注重素质的提高
    位于城市和农村交接处的将台路中学办学条件差，学生来源差。就拿这一批职业高中学生来说，都是其它学校挑剩下的。当时学生并不了解自己将来的工作，而老师们心中明白有一部分学生要到合资企业工作，面临“低进高出”，学校培养任务十分艰巨。
    根据用人单位的要求，学校培养目标着眼于劳动者素质的提高，为此他们实行学分制，全面考核学生。学分包括学习积分、操行积分、体育积分，奖励加分、惩罚扣分，严格实行量化管理。学生毕业后，主要依据积分进行择优推荐，按学分高低择优向用人单位推荐。这一批赴日实习同学占毕业班总人数的1／3，都是学分较高的学生。
    学生入学，校方就把实行学分制的办法、目的向大家说明，使大家明确，只有德智体全面发展才能优先选择工作志愿，学分太低，学校不安排工作。实行这一制度，关系到每一个学生的切身利益，绝大部分学生都能认真对待。
    这所学校的校长认为，考进职业高中的学生，入学分数线较低，这是客观事实。由于各个学校的办学条件、师资条件不一样，中考时必然出现一批基础没有打好的差生，通过职业高中3年的教育，可以把他们培养成合格的劳动者。
    现在这24名学生已成为北京松下彩色显像管厂熟练的操作工，有的当上了领班，有的带上了徒弟，他们是一批公认的合格劳动者。
