At a recent ethnic unity and progress commendation meeting, the Communist Party of China Guizhou Provincial Committee and the Guizhou Provincial Government commended Zhang Kaibang, the director of the sheep research room and associate researcher of the Guizhou Provincial Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Research Institute, for his outstanding achievements in working in ethnic minority areas for 30 years and dedicating himself to scientific and technological poverty alleviation.

The 50-year-old Zhang Kaibang has nearly 30 years of experience in conducting scientific research in remote and impoverished areas. His footsteps have covered the impoverished counties of Guizhou, and he spends nearly 300 days each year promoting scientific sheep farming, bringing scientific and technological benefits to the people of various ethnic groups, and helping them start on the path to poverty alleviation and prosperity. People call Zhang Kaibang the "scientific and technological pioneer of ethnic mountainous areas."

Zhang Kaibang, who graduated from the Guizhou Agricultural College in 1959, voluntarily requested to be transferred from the Guizhou Provincial Agricultural Department to the harsh conditions of the Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County in the old Liangshan area to participate in the hybrid improvement work of Weining fine wool sheep.

Subsequently, Zhang Kaibang, on behalf of the Animal Husbandry Research Institute, signed an agreement with Luodian County to develop a commercial sheep base. He came to this remote mountainous area, and every grassland and sheep point left his footprints.

In the past three years, the number of goats in Luodian County has increased from 8,000 in 1985 to 22,000, an increase of more than 1.7 times, making it the county with the largest increase in goats in the province, with an income of over 350,000 yuan. More than 200 sheep farming households have an average annual income of over 2,000 yuan, with the highest reaching 8,700 yuan. He promoted the experience of Luodian to more than 10 impoverished counties in Qiannan and Qianxinan.

    扎根边远山区传播科技知识
    张开帮被誉为“民族山乡科技播火者”
    本报贵阳12月18日电　记者胡跃平报道：在日前召开的一次民族团结进步表彰会上，贵州省委、省政府表彰了省畜牧兽医科研所养羊研究室主任、助理研究员张开帮在民族地区扎根30年、一心扑在科技扶贫上的先进事迹。
    今年50岁的张开帮，有近30年在边远贫困地区蹲点搞科研的经历。他的足迹遍布贵州的贫困县，每年近300天在下面推广科学养羊，为各族群众带来了科技实惠，使他们开始走上脱贫致富的道路。人们称张开帮是“民族山乡科技播火者。”
    1959年从贵州省牧校专科班毕业的张开帮，主动要求从省农业厅机关调往条件艰苦的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县老凉山地区，参加威宁绵羊的杂交改良工作。
    接着，张开帮代表畜牧所与罗甸县签订了发展商品羊基地的协议书，来到这边远山区，每块草场、每个羊点都留下了他的足迹。
    3年来，罗甸县山羊存栏数由1985年的8000只增至2.2万只，增加1.7倍多，成为全省山羊增长幅度最大的县，收入35万多元。200多养羊专业户的年均收入一般在2000元以上，最高的达8700元。他把罗甸的经验先后推广到黔南、黔西南等地区的10多个贫困县。
