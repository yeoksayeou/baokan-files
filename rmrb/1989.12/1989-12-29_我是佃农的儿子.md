	I Am the Son of a Tenant Farmer
	Li Demin

	During an interview with He Zhukang, Secretary of the Communist Party of China's (CPC) Jilin Provincial Committee, the reporter boldly asked, "Are you the son of He Longgang?" He smiled and replied, "I am not the son of a 'long-term worker'; I am the son of a tenant farmer."

	The reporter's question had a reason behind it: during the turmoil, someone fabricated a "relationship network," who is whose son, who is whose son-in-law, same surname means father-son relationship, different surname means father-in-law and son-in-law relationship, placing many leading cadres in the network. He Zhukang was placed in the "relationship" with the revolutionary predecessor He Longgang because of his surname. When talking about "relationships," He Zhukang said: most of them are fabricated. For example, between me and He Old, our hometowns are different; I am from Jiangsu Qidong, and he is from Hunan Huayong. He served as important party and government positions, and my father was a tenant farmer before liberation, and after liberation, he served as the production team leader. I have nothing to do with Comrade He Longgang. He also said, therefore, whether one can become a leading cadre depends on whether one is competent, not on who is whose son or relative. He Zhukang told the reporter: among the leading comrades of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government, none are children of leading cadres.

	During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, such lies were too many and too absurd. Some time ago, the Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Der Hao Tian, told a reporter that someone revealed that he was the son-in-law of a national leader, which was sheer nonsense. He also said that the General Staff Department has 3 deputy chiefs who were inexplicably linked to national leaders. A deputy chief of the General Staff was also said to be the son of He Longgang because of his surname.

	This kind of fabricated method is really despicable. Rumors can deceive people for a while, and during the turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots, such rumors have a great deceptive and inciting effect. But rumors are just rumors. After the rumors are exposed, they can only declare the low moral character and despicable means of those who fabricated the rumors. Regrettably, some overseas journalists also fabricated and spread these rumors. Is this what they advocate as "press freedom"?

    “我是佃农的儿子”
    李德民
    采访中共吉林省委书记何竹康同志，记者冒昧提出一个问题：“您是何长工的儿子吗？”他笑答：“我不是‘长工’的儿子，我是佃农的儿子。”
    记者提问，事出有因：动乱中有人编造“关系网”，谁是谁的儿子，谁是谁的女婿，同姓的是父子关系，异姓的是翁婿关系，把许多领导干部置之网上。何竹康因为姓何，被人记到革命前辈何长工的“关系”上了。谈起“关系”，何竹康说：绝大多数是编造的，比如我和何老，首先籍贯就不同，我是江苏启东，他是湖南华容；他担任过党政要职，我父亲解放前身为佃农，解放后，当过生产队长，我与何长工同志毫不相干。他又说，所以能当领导干部，要看称职不称职，而不是看他是谁的儿子或者是谁的亲戚。何竹康告诉记者：在吉林省委、省政府的领导同志中，没有一个是领导干部的子女。
    在动乱和反革命暴乱期间，这类谎言造得太多、也太离奇了。中国人民解放军总参谋长迟浩田前些时对某记者说，有人透露说他是某个国家领导人的女婿，真是无稽之谈。他还说，总参谋部有3位正副总长都被人莫名其妙地和国家领导人挂上了钩。一位副总参谋长也因为姓何，也成了何长工之子。
    这种捏造的手法，实在是太卑鄙了。谣言能蒙骗人于一时，在动乱乃至反革命暴乱期间，这类谣言确有很大的欺骗与煽动作用。但谣言毕竟是谣言，谣言被揭穿之后，只能宣告这些制造谣言的人品格之低下，手段之卑鄙。令人遗憾的是，海外一些报人也在制造和散布这些谣言，难道这就是他们标榜的“新闻自由”吗？
