Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was fined $20,000 by a Los Angeles court on December 28 for concealing personal stock income. According to reports, the mayor failed to declare six investments in bonds and stocks between 1986 and 1988, which earned him at least tens of thousands of dollars.

Meanwhile, a federal grand jury is investigating Bradley's part-time job at Far East National Bank. It was reported that in 1988, he earned $180,000 for serving as a consultant for the bank, but he later returned the payment. During his tenure, Los Angeles City Comptroller Rick Ridley deposited $2 million of city funds into the bank. Whether this decision was influenced by Mayor Bradley will be a key focus of the grand jury's investigation.

    美洛杉矶市长瞒报收入被罚
    洛杉矶法院二十八日宣布，由于洛杉矶市市长汤姆·布拉德莱瞒报个人股票收益，法庭决定对他课以两万美元的罚金。据报载，这位洛杉矶市长在一九八六至一九八八年期间，没有申报他个人在债券和股票方面的六项投资。这些投资使他获得了至少数万美元的收入。
    与此同时，联邦大陪审团正在对布拉德莱市长在远东国民银行内兼职一事进行调查。据报道，一九八八年他因担任这家银行的咨询顾问而获得酬金一点八万美元，但他后来退还了这笔报酬。在他兼职期间，洛杉矶财政部长里登伯格曾把二百万美元的市府基金存入该行。这项存款的决定是不是在布拉德莱市长的影响下作出的，将是大陪审团调查的重点之一。
