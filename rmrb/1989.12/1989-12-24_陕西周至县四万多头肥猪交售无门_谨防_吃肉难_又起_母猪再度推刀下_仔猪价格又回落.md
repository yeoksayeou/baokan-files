    Over 40,000 Fat Pigs in Shaanxi's Zhouzhi County Face Sales Issues
    Beware of the "Meat Shortage" Resurfacing
    Sows Slaughtered Again, Piglet Prices Drop

    According to a report from the *Market News*, Shaanxi Province's Zhouzhi County is currently facing a worrying situation. The county has 44,000 fat pigs ready for sale but no market to sell them. Farmers are anxious, and the county's food company, facing poor sales, is reluctant to purchase them.

    In response to the "meat shortage" problem that has emerged in recent years, Zhouzhi County last year distributed 836 tons of high-quality fertilizer to farmers who sold live pigs, encouraging them to raise pigs. This effort played a role in alleviating the meat shortage for urban residents. This year, Zhouzhi County has 205,000 pigs on hand, with an average of 1.7 pigs per household. There are 54,000 fat pigs weighing over 100 kilograms. Despite the county food company's efforts to find buyers, only 10,000 pigs have been sold, leaving 44,000 fat pigs still awaiting sale. An elderly farmer from Zhenshan Town lamented, "Our family worked hard all year to raise these three pigs, hoping to exchange them for some fertilizer and buy a plow ox. Who would have thought the pig price dropped from 1.65 yuan per kilogram to 1.55 yuan, and the food department still won't buy them." In response, Zhang, the manager of the county food company, sighed, "It's not that we don't want to buy, but we dare not. This year, Xi'an City assigned us to increase the supply of 51,000 live pigs, but by the end of November, we had only supplied 32,000." A deputy manager added, "On November 17, the county sent 884 purchased pigs to the designated location in Linzhang. Except for the 400 within the quota, the remaining 484 were not accepted. After much pleading, they agreed to take 180 at a reduced price and on account of personal favors. The remaining 304 had to be brought back to Zhouzhi, and 18 died on the way."

    The inability to sell over 40,000 fat pigs has severely dampened the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs. Many households have slaughtered their sows and boars, and the price of piglets has dropped from over 90 yuan to around 10 yuan. Local officials complain, "When there was no meat, people came to us for help. Now that there are too many pigs, no one helps us solve the problem." If timely measures are not taken to protect farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, the "meat shortage" problem will resurface.

    陕西周至县四万多头肥猪交售无门
    谨防“吃肉难”又起
    母猪再度推刀下　仔猪价格又回落
    本报讯　据《市场报》报道：陕西省周至县，近日来出现了令人忧虑的情况，全县亟待出栏的4.4万头肥猪至今销售无门。农民心急如焚，县食品公司却因销路不畅，叫苦连天，不敢收购。
    面对近年来出现的“吃肉难”问题，周至县去年曾拿出836吨优质化肥奖售给售生猪的农户，鼓励农民养猪，对缓解城市人民吃肉难起了一定的作用。今年周至县生猪存栏20.5万头，户均1.7头。光是毛重在100公斤以上的肥猪就有5.4万头。尽管县食品公司四处奔波，寻找销路，可至今仅调出1万头，尚有4.4万头肥猪亟待出栏。终南镇一位老农含泪说道：“一家人辛辛苦苦一年才养了这3头猪，指望用这换些化肥，买头耕牛，谁知猪价从一斤一块六毛五降到一块五毛五，食品部门还不收购。”对此，县食品公司张经理却愁眉不展地说：“不是我们不收购，而是不敢收购。今年西安市给我们下达了上调51000头生猪任务，可到11月底，才上调了32000头。”一位副经理说：“11月17日，县上将884头收购的生猪运到指定地点临漳后，除指标内的400头外，其余的484头一概不收。好说歹求，才在价格下浮和看在人情的份上收了180头。其余304头只好从临漳拉回周至，途中又死去了18头。”
    4万多头大肥猪售不出，已严重地挫伤了广大农民养猪的积极性，不少农户宰杀母猪和公猪，仔猪价格也由过去的90多元下跌到现在的10来元。基层干部诉苦道：“没肉吃时找我们，如今猪多了，却没人帮我们分忧解愁。”目前如不及时采取措施保护农民养猪积极性，“吃肉难”的问题又将会出现。　（张伟　张兴）
