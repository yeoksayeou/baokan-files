Current cadre corps construction has seen some new situations and problems, mainly manifesting in the following five abnormal trends.

Self-awareness has strengthened, while collective consciousness has weakened. Some cadres lack a sense of the overall picture. When executing higher-level directives, they often prioritize the interests of their own units or regions. Some place personal opinions first, lacking trust, understanding, and support for their comrades.

Democratic consciousness has strengthened, while the consciousness of centralization has weakened. There are two situations: First, some cadres want democracy but not centralization. They want higher-level leadership to be as democratic as possible, but are unwilling to execute the decisions of higher-level organizations and the Party's policies and guidelines. Some cadres even adopt the attitude of "you have your policies, I have my countermeasures." Not only are the orders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council not carried out to the end, but even the guidelines and policies of local Party committees and governments are not fully implemented. Second, some cadres in their work only emphasize democracy and not centralization, failing to concentrate the correct opinions of the masses. Some leading cadres, when encountering issues, do not guide, fear offending people, fear that some people's "heads are hard to shave," and fear that they cannot control the situation.

The consciousness of studying science and culture has strengthened, while the study of Marxism-Leninism has weakened. In some units and departments, there is almost no mention of studying Marxism-Leninism. In some professional and technical units, there was a time when studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought was considered a joke. Some professional and technical cadres believe that they can rely on their technical skills to make a living, and that studying Marxism-Leninism is irrelevant to them. Some ordinary cadres believe that in this age of information explosion, it is more useful to learn more scientific and cultural knowledge. Some grassroots leading cadres think that they are already too busy with work, and have no time to study Marxism-Leninism.

The consciousness of degrees has strengthened, while the consciousness of intelligence has weakened. Some cadres have incorrect guiding ideologies, often studying for the sake of obtaining a degree, without paying attention to the improvement of intelligence. Once a degree is obtained, it means the task is completed. There is no talk of using the knowledge learned to come up with new ideas or new work plans.

Material consciousness has strengthened, while ideological consciousness has weakened. Some cadres have a very weak sense of people, collective, nation, and communist ideals in their minds, while the ideas of son, house, and money are very strong. They pursue personal material enjoyment. A few cadres have become slaves to money, resorting to all means to "make money," engaging in corruption, extortion, embezzlement, and even speculating and profiteering.

    干部队伍中存在五种畸型态势
    当前干部队伍建设中出现了一些新情况、新问题，主要有以下五种畸型态势。
    自我意识增强，而整体意识淡化。有的干部缺乏全局观念。执行上级指示往往从本单位、本地区的利益出发；有的个人意见第一，对同志缺乏信任、理解和支持。
    民主意识增强，而集中意识淡化。有两种情况：一是有一部分干部只要民主，不要集中。要求上级越民主越好，可对上级组织的决定和党的方针、政策的执行就不那么情愿了，有些干部甚至搞“你有政策，我有对策”。不但党中央、国务院的号令不能一声喊到底，就连地方党委、政府的方针、政策也贯彻不到底。二是少数干部工作中只讲民主，不讲集中，不去集中群众的正确意见。有的领导干部，遇事不去引导，怕得罪人，怕一些人“头难剃”，怕收不了场。
    学习科学文化意识增强，而学习马列淡化。在有些单位、有些部门基本不提学习马列。在一些专业技术单位，一度把学习马列主义、毛泽东思想当作笑话。一些专业技术干部认为凭技术吃饭，学习马列与己无关。一些普通干部认为在知识爆炸的年代，还是多学一些科学文化知识有用。一些基层领导干部认为，工作还干不过来呢，哪有功夫去学马列。
    文凭意识增强，而智能意识淡化。有的干部指导思想不端正，往往为文凭而学习，不注意智能的提高。一张文凭到手，意味着大功告成。根本谈不上运用所学知识去考虑出新的思想，新的工作方案了。
    物质意识增强，而思想意识淡化。有的干部头脑中的人民、集体、国家和共产主义理想观念十分淡薄，而儿子、房子、票子观念在头脑中十分强烈，一味追求个人的物质享受。少数干部完全成了金钱的奴隶，不惜一切手段“捞钱”，贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、侵吞公物，以致投机倒把的事也干。
