A stable social environment is the primary condition for the modernization of socialism. After the proletariat seizes power and becomes the ruling class, after suppressing the resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes and expropriating the expropriators, the fundamental task is to develop the productive forces and create a labor productivity higher than that of the capitalist system. This requires a long-term stable social environment. Only with a long-term stable social environment can the people of the entire nation unite and concentrate their efforts to build socialism well. The 40-year history of our country also proves that a stable social environment is crucial for economic development. During the "Cultural Revolution," a decade of "total civil war," workers could not produce normally, schools could not teach normally, and cadres could not work normally. How could the national economy not be on the brink of collapse?

In the turmoil of this spring and summer, many well-meaning people, while pursuing democracy, got involved in the chaos. One of their lessons is that they did not understand this truth: only by maintaining the long-term stability of the country can we develop and perfect socialist democratic politics. This is because the development of socialist democracy is constrained by economic and cultural development. The more socialist economy develops, the more the national culture develops, the more democracy develops. The development of socialist democratic politics also requires a sound legal system, strict discipline, and normal work order. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: developing socialist democracy cannot be done with the "Great Leap Forward" method, nor with the "Great Debate" method. This is very correct. The construction of socialist democratic politics must be step-by-step and led. Using the "Great Leap Forward" method, the "Great Debate" method can only foment turmoil, hinder the construction of democracy and the legal system, and hinder the Four Modernizations.

Only by maintaining a long-term stable social environment can we ensure that the reform and opening up proceed smoothly. Reform is the "locomotive" for the progress of socialist society, including reforms in economic, political, educational, and scientific research systems, and the transition from old to new systems. This is a systematic project that must be carried out with leadership, step-by-step, and in an orderly manner, with theoretical guidance, policies, regulations, and other supporting measures. Therefore, it cannot be done in an "earthquake" but must be done in a stable environment to proceed smoothly. As for opening up, stability is the first condition that investors consider. Maintaining a stable social environment is a prerequisite for opening up.

Only by maintaining a long-term stable social environment can we ensure that the people of the entire nation can engage in normal production, study, scientific research, work, and social activities in different positions. This is a very clear matter. The Party and the people have experienced this in their own lives and realized that stability is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. Therefore, we must pool our wisdom and strength to create and maintain a long-term stable social environment.

The stability of our country is determined by the nature of the socialist system. The development of the socialist system itself is a process of self-improvement and self-renewal. The contradictions between the productive forces and production relations, the economic base and superstructure in socialist society are, in general, non-antagonistic contradictions. When they are basically compatible, there are still some contradictions. Therefore, these contradictions can be resolved without overthrowing the existing production relations and superstructure, and can be achieved through self-adjustment within the socialist system. That is, according to the actual level of productive forces and the objective requirements for their further development, consciously adjust the aspects and links in the production relations that are not in line with the productive forces, and adjust the aspects and links in the superstructure that are not in line with the economic base, so as to promote the development of productive forces and make socialism full of vitality and vigor. The entire process of socialist society advancing to communism is achieved through the gradual and long-term accumulation of new quality and new structural elements and the gradual decline of old quality and old elements. As Marx said, under socialist conditions, "social evolution will no longer be political revolution." Since the basic contradictions of socialist society are resolved in the process of continuous adjustment and improvement within the socialist system, it itself requires a long-term stable social environment. Any disturbance in social life is a deviation from the principles of socialism. We adhere to socialism and must always safeguard and maintain national stability.

Maintaining the steady and coordinated development of the economy

Economy is the material foundation for social development. The stability of the economy plays a decisive role in the stability of politics, the process of democratization, and the development of science and culture. Engels once said: "The direct material means of subsistence, and thus a definite stage of economic development of a nation or an epoch, forms the basis, on which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the religious ideas of the people concerned have been evolved." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 3, p. 574) Lenin also pointed out: "To become a civilized nation, one must have a sufficiently developed production of material means of production, a sufficiently material base." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 4, p. 688) We want to maintain and create a long-term stable social environment, which ultimately comes down to developing the economy and making the national economy develop steadily, stably, and in a coordinated manner. This is the basic sign of economic stability.

To stabilize the economy, we must first place agriculture in an important strategic position. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. How agriculture develops is an extremely important issue that affects the food of 1.1 billion people, the development of the entire national economy, the overall situation of reform, and social stability and unity. The Thirteenth Party Congress report pointed out that the stable growth of agriculture and the improvement of the agricultural industrial structure are the foundation for the long-term stable development of the entire national economy. In the primary stage of socialism, the production conditions of our country's agriculture are still relatively backward, and development is still very unstable. Strengthening agricultural construction is particularly urgent and important. Therefore, we should concentrate our efforts on agriculture, strengthen support for agriculture, strengthen urban support for rural areas, strengthen rural education, science and technology research, and the promotion of new technologies, and strengthen socialist education for peasants, guiding them to follow the socialist road. We should take practical measures in politics, economy, education, science, and culture, and continuously consolidate the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis.

To maintain the steady and coordinated development of the national economy, we must proceed steadily and continuously improve economic and social benefits. Economic overheating and large fluctuations are serious lessons from 40 years of economic development. Detaching from China's national conditions, exceeding national strength, pursuing high targets, high speeds, and high accumulation will inevitably result in low efficiency. Our speed should be based on steady, stable, and coordinated development. Impatience leads to failure. This is the dialectic of things. We should correctly handle the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and seriously ensure the production and supply of people's necessary living goods and maintain the basic stability of sales prices. Comrade Chen Yun once emphasized that we should arrange people's lives well and truly serve the people's interests. We should handle this issue well.

To maintain the steady and coordinated development of the economy, we must also solve the problem of unfair distribution in society. The distribution relationship is an aspect of the production relationship. In the primary stage of socialism in our country, there are multiple economic components with public ownership as the mainstay. Therefore, in the personal income of residents, there are not only labor income but also non-labor income; among non-labor income, there is income from exploiting others' surplus labor and non-labor income that does not exploit others' labor, etc. Therefore, our distribution policy should reasonably widen the income gap, oppose egalitarianism; at the same time, prevent the gap between the rich and the poor, and adhere to the socialist direction of common prosperity. Only in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of laborers and improve efficiency. Currently, in the actual economic life of our country, the main manifestations of unfair distribution are the phenomenon of "inverted" complex labor and simple labor, mental labor and physical labor, the gap between non-labor income that exploits others' surplus labor and labor income is widening, the income gap between some individual laborers and workers in enterprises and institutions who receive income according to labor is too large, and some people in society have become "overnight millionaires" with illegal income as their main source, causing strong dissatisfaction among the people. The above contradictions have caused psychological imbalances among the people, forming an unstable factor in society. The distribution issue directly affects the vital interests of the broad masses of laborers. Various contradictions, frictions, and even conflicts in society are often related to the issue of unfair distribution in society. Therefore, to create a lasting stable economic environment, we must lead and step-by-step solve the problem of unfair distribution in a practical way.

To maintain the steady and coordinated development of the economy, we must also combine rectification and deepening of reform. Rectification is carried out under the general direction of reform and opening up. Rectification not only creates the necessary conditions for the deepening and healthy development of reform but also needs the cooperation of reform. To rectify the economic environment, control inflation, and strive to ease the contradiction between social total demand exceeding total supply, gradually reduce the inflation rate to below 10%, this is an indispensable condition for deepening reform. At the same time, during the rectification, we must adjust and improve the existing reform measures, consolidate and develop the achievements of the reform. We must adhere to the principle of combining planned economy with market regulation, neither practicing the completely planned economy of the past to avoid excessive and rigid control nor completely implementing a market economy to avoid chaos in economic life and the entire social life. During the rectification period, we should have more planning, appropriately strengthen centralization, which is centralization based on the initiative of local areas, not excessive centralization that denies the necessary autonomy of local enterprises. While continuing to activate the micro-economy, gradually establish a macro-control system that can promote the stable development of the economy.

Maintaining the stability and continuity of policies is also a very important issue for economic stability. We must continue to adhere to the public ownership system as the mainstay and develop multiple economic components, continue to stabilize and improve the household contract responsibility system in rural areas and the contract responsibility system in industrial enterprises, correctly handle the relationship between the state, enterprises, and individuals, and the relationship between current interests and long-term interests. Policy stability can stabilize people's minds and maintain the long-term enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people.

Building a high degree of socialist democracy and a complete legal system

Building a high degree of socialist democracy and a complete legal system is a fundamental task of China's socialist modernization. Without democracy, there is no socialism. Socialist democracy is built on the basis of the public ownership of the means of production and is also an essential characteristic of socialist society. Because the public ownership of the means of production and the socialization of production necessarily require the democratization of politics. Under the socialist system, people not only need a rich material life and a civilized spiritual life but also need a democratic political life. The vibrant and creative socialist cause is created by the masses of the people, and only by relying on the masses can we achieve comprehensive victory in socialist construction.

Socialist democratic politics is the unity of the state system and the political system. Socialist democratic politics, as a state system, is that the people of the entire socialist state are the masters of the house, sharing the different forms of ownership and control of the means of production, and on this basis, enjoying the power to manage the state. Our country practices the political system of people's democratic dictatorship, with the vast majority of the people enjoying the broadest democracy, and only a small number of enemy elements being subjected to dictatorship. Socialist democratic politics, as a political system, is the organizational structure and form in which the people exercise the power to manage the state. The people's congress system we practice reflects the unity of democracy and centralism among the people. A small number of people who stubbornly advocate bourgeois liberalization, advocating "political democratization," but what they advocate is democracy without people's democratic dictatorship, democracy without the leadership of the Communist Party. This is not socialist democracy but can only be bourgeois democracy.

Socialist democracy has a process of continuous improvement. Democracy must be continuously developed and gradually improved. The degree of development of socialist democratic politics directly depends on the level of social economic and cultural development. Currently, we must establish and improve the mechanism to realize socialist democracy. It includes: the scientific and democratic decision-making process—decision-making strictly relies on the wisdom and ability of the group, making the subject of decision-making activities group-based; to establish the organizational structure and procedures of decision-making activities, making decision-making activities organizational; the political consultation mechanism—allowing the people to enjoy the right to know national affairs through various forms, having a certain place for the people to discuss politics, and having smooth channels for reflecting the people's opinions; the participation mechanism—enhancing and improving the people's awareness of participation, and through different organizational forms, allowing people of different classes to participate in the management of various specific affairs of the state; the supervision mechanism—in the operation of the state machinery, the broad masses of the people should effectively supervise state officials, ensure the efficient operation of each link of the state machinery, prevent and overcome the bureaucratism, corruption, and various corrupt phenomena of state officials, and prevent "from being a public servant to being a master of society."

Strengthening the construction of the socialist legal system can create a stable domestic political environment. Strengthening the legal system is to establish a legal system based on the Constitution, bringing the political life, economic life, cultural life, and social life of the people into the track of the legal system. Legal construction also includes legal education for the people, enhancing legal awareness, and cultivating the habit of observing laws and regulations.

Socialist democracy and socialist legal system are interdependent and inseparable. Socialist democracy is the premise and basis of the socialist legal system, and the socialist legal system is the embodiment and guarantee of socialist democracy. To make the socialist democratic system institutionalized and legalized, to ensure the exercise and realization of people's democratic rights, and to make people's democratic rights protected by law. Socialist democracy cannot be separated from the socialist legal system. Without the socialist legal system, democracy will destroy the democratic system of the state, the normal democratic life of the people, and the democratic rights of the people. Similarly, without socialist democracy, there is no socialist legal system. Only by closely combining the construction of socialist democracy and the construction of the socialist legal system can we consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and create a long-term stable social environment for socialist construction and reform and opening up. The degree of perfection of socialist democracy and the legal system is an important sign of the maturity of the socialist system.

Strengthening ideological and political work

Building a strong spiritual pillar

Maintaining a stable social environment is in the fundamental interests of the Party's cause and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. For this, we need to mobilize the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to strive for the stability of China's social environment, which requires strengthening ideological and political work, and taking patriotism, collectivism, and the great ideal of communism as the main spiritual pillar for the people of all ethnic groups in China to unite and build a socialist powerhouse.

First, patriotism. Lenin pointed out: "Patriotism is a deep-seated feeling for one's native land that has been fixed over centuries." For more than a hundred years, due to the long-term aggression of imperialism, the Chinese people have a glorious tradition of patriotism. In the period of the national democratic revolution, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, fought bravely and sacrificed themselves to create an independent, free, and democratic People's Republic of China. In the socialist period, patriotism is mainly manifested in defending the independence and dignity of the socialist People's Republic, for the prosperity and prosperity of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and for the realization of the "Four Modernizations" and the revitalization of China. In the early 1950s, when our country's economy had just recovered from the wounds of war, a group of scholars and students studying in the United States broke through numerous obstacles and returned to the motherland to participate in socialist construction, writing a chapter of patriotism. In recent years, many young and middle-aged intellectuals have achieved excellent results in studying abroad and furthering their studies, and they have given up the favorable treatment abroad and connected their lifelong careers with the revitalization of the motherland. "My career is in the motherland" expresses their sublime patriotism. Patriotism is a banner with great appeal, and it produces great cohesion and centripetal force on the basis of the long history and culture of the Chinese people. It is the ideological foundation for mobilizing and uniting the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Patriotism is an important spiritual pillar for maintaining stability and unity. Patriotism education should be popularized among the people of all ethnic groups and deeply rooted in people's hearts through various forms, forming the virtues of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.

Second, collectivism. We are a socialist country, and the dominant economic base is the socialist public ownership system. The public ownership system requires the establishment of an ideological form that matches it—collectivism. Some people advocate individualism, the "individualism" that puts oneself at the center. This ideology is incompatible with our country's economic base. Collectivism is the basic norm for handling the relationship between people and people, between individuals and collectives in socialist society. Collectivism is a sublime spiritual realm, requiring people to have common ideals, noble sentiments, and professional ethics, and a strict sense of organizational discipline.

On the basis of collectivist ideology, we should establish a scientific value system, that is, correctly handle the relationship between individuals and society. Marx said: "'Value' this universal concept arises from the relationship between people and the external objects that satisfy their needs." Value reflects the relationship between people's subjective needs and the objective objects that satisfy these needs. People are the subjects of society. As subjects, people should obtain their due status in society and satisfy their material and cultural needs for survival and development from society to realize their self-value; at the same time, people are also the objects of society. As objects, people should also satisfy the needs of society and make contributions to society to realize their social value. Therefore, people's value should be the unity of self-value and social value, including two aspects: one is the respect and satisfaction of society for the status of individuals, and the other is the contribution of individuals to society. The formula for people's value = contribution: demand. That is, a person's value is determined by the ratio of his "contribution" and "demand." This is the scientific value view of socialist people.

Third, the ideal of communism. Ideals are the beliefs, aspirations, and struggles of people. The ideal of communism is the concentrated embodiment of the worldview of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and is a powerful spiritual pillar that guides people's actions. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics and realizing socialist modernization is the common ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The highest ideal of the Communist Party of China is to realize communism. Whether in the past, present, or future, this highest ideal is the source of strength for communists and advanced elements and is also an extremely important spiritual pillar for our country and nation.

Communism is no longer an abstract ideal but a scientific truth tested by practice. From the 16th century to the early 19th century, utopian socialism and communism experienced more than four hundred years of exploration. Due to Marx's two great discoveries—the materialist view of history and the theory of surplus value, and the discovery of the social force to overthrow capitalism—the proletariat, a great leap in human cognition was achieved, making socialism and communism change from utopian to scientific. From the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1871 to try proletarian dictatorship, to the great victories of the socialist revolutions in Russia, China, and a series of countries, communism has changed from a scientific ideological system, a revolutionary communist movement, to a new and growing social system—socialism. Socialism is the primary stage of communism. We are now implementing socialist policies, but it is guided by communist ideology. The two are both different and connected. In the socialist period, we do not require all the people in the country to establish the ideal of communism. A belief, faith is voluntary. However, we must expand the propaganda of communism because it represents the future of human social development, represents the long-term interests and beautiful wishes of the people. In the practice of the ideal of communism among communists and advanced elements, making the light of the ideal of communism shine on society, it will undoubtedly inspire the broad masses of the people and form a great and immeasurable spiritual force. Therefore, the ideal of communism is also an extremely important spiritual pillar for building socialism.

We create a long-term stable social environment, which comes down to one point, that is, to vigorously develop the productive forces, continuously increase the total amount of social products, and on this basis, make the country increasingly prosperous and strong, and improve the material and cultural life of the people, so as to fundamentally guarantee the long-term stability of our country.

    创造和保持稳定的社会环境
    高光
    稳定的社会环境是社会主义现代化建设的首要条件
    无产阶级夺取政权上升为统治阶级，在镇压被推翻的剥削阶级的反抗和剥夺剥夺者之后，根本的任务就是发展生产力，创造高于资本主义制度的劳动生产率。这就需要有一个长期稳定的社会环境。只有社会环境长期稳定，全国人民才能同心同德、集中精力搞好社会主义现代化建设。建国40年的历史也证明，稳定的社会环境对于经济的发展至关重要。“文化大革命”十年，“全面内战”，搞得工人不能正常生产，学校不能正常上课，干部不能正常上班，国民经济怎能不濒临崩溃的边缘呢？
    在今年春夏之交的风波中，许多好心的人一面追求民主，一面卷入动乱。他们的一个教训，就是不懂得这样一个道理：只有保持国家的长期稳定，才能发展和完善社会主义民主政治。这是因为社会主义民主的发展，是受经济和文化的发展制约的。社会主义经济愈是发展，全民族的文化愈是发展，民主愈是向前发展。社会主义民主政治的发展，还需要健全的法制，严明的纪律，正常的工作秩序。邓小平同志说：发展社会主义民主，不能用“大跃进”的做法，不能用“大鸣大放”的做法，这是非常对的。社会主义民主政治建设一定要有步骤、有领导。采取“大跃进”的做法，“大鸣大放”的做法只能助长动乱，只能妨碍民主和法制建设，只能妨碍四个现代化。
    保持长期稳定的社会环境，才能保证改革开放顺利进行。改革是社会主义社会前进的“火车头”，它包括经济体制、政治体制、教育体制、科研体制等各领域的体制改革和新旧体制的转换。这是一个系统的工程，要有领导、有步骤、有秩序地进行，要有理论指导、方针、政策、法规等配套措施。因此，它不能在“地震”中而必须在稳定的环境中，才能顺利进行。至于开放，稳定是投资者首先考虑的条件，保持稳定的社会环境是开放的前提。
    保持长期稳定的社会环境，才能保证全国人民在不同的岗位上，进行正常的生产、学习、科研、工作和交往活动，这是非常明白的事情。党和人民从自己切身经历中体会到，稳定是中国人民的根本利益所在。因此，必须群策群力创造和保持一个长期稳定的社会环境。
    保持我们国家的稳定，是由社会主义制度的性质所决定的。社会主义制度本身的发展，是一个自我完善、自我更新的过程。社会主义社会生产力和生产关系、经济基础和上层建筑之间的矛盾，从总体上看是非对抗性的矛盾。它们之间在基本适合的情况下，又存在一定的矛盾。因此，这种矛盾的解决，不需要推翻现存的生产关系和上层建筑，可以经过社会主义制度本身进行自我调整来达到。即根据生产力的现实水平和进一步发展的客观要求，自觉地调整生产关系中与生产力不相适应的环节和方面，调整上层建筑中与经济基础不相适应的环节和方面，从而推动生产力向前发展，使社会主义充满活力和生机。社会主义社会向前发展，一直过渡到共产主义的整个过程，都是经过新质与新结构的要素的逐渐长期积累和旧质旧要素的逐渐衰亡来实现的。正如马克思所说的，在社会主义条件下，“社会进化将不再是政治革命”。社会主义社会的基本矛盾既然是在社会主义制度本身不断调整和完善过程中获得解决的，因此它本身需要一个长期稳定的社会环境，任何引起社会生活的动荡，都是背离社会主义原则的。我们坚持社会主义，就要时刻维护和保持国家的稳定。
        保持经济持续稳定协调发展
      经济是社会发展的物质基础。经济的稳定，对于政治的稳定、民主化的进程、以及科学文化的发展，都起着决定性的作用。恩格斯说过：“直接的物质的生活资料的生产，因而一个民族或一个时代的一定的经济发展阶段，便构成基础，人们的国家制度、法的观点、艺术以及宗教观念，就是从这个基础上发展起来的”。（《马克思恩格斯选集》第3卷，第574页）列宁也指出过：“要成为文明国家，就必须有相当发达的物质生产资料的生产，必须有相当的物质基础”。（《列宁选集》第4卷，第688页）我们要保持和创造一个长期稳定的社会环境，归根到底，是把经济搞上去，使国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展，这是经济稳定的基本标志。
    稳定经济，首先要把发展农业放在重要的战略地位。农业是国民经济的基础。农业发展如何，这是关系到十一亿人口吃饭，关系到整个国民经济的发展，关系到改革的全局，关系到社会的安定团结的极端重要的问题。十三大报告指出，农业的稳定增长和农村产业结构的改善，是整个国民经济长期稳定发展的基础。在社会主义初级阶段，我国农业生产条件还比较落后，发展还很不稳定，加强农业建设尤为迫切和重要。因此，应当集中力量搞好农业，要加强对农业的支援，加强城市对农村的支援，加强农村教育、科技研究和新技术推广，加强对农民的社会主义教育，引导他们走社会主义道路，从政治、经济、教育、科学文化等方面不断地采取切实措施，在新的基础上不断地巩固工农联盟。
    要保持国民经济持续稳定协调发展，就必须稳步前进，不断提高经济效益和社会效益。经济过热、大起大落是40年经济发展中的严重教训。脱离中国的国情，超越国力，搞高指标、高速度、高积累，必然造成低效益。我们的速度，应是建立在持续稳定协调发展基础上的速度。急于求成，欲速则不达。这是事物发展的辩证法。我们应当正确地处理农轻重的关系，积累与消费的关系，把人民生活必需品的生产和供应认真搞好，并保持销售价格的基本稳定。陈云同志曾经强调指出，要安排好人民生活，真正为人民谋福利，我们应当处理好这个问题。
    保持经济持续稳定协调发展，还要解决社会上出现的分配不公的问题。分配关系是生产关系的一个方面。我国社会主义初级阶段存在着以公有制为主体的多种经济成分，因此，在居民的个人收入中，不仅包括劳动收入，也包括非劳动收入；非劳动收入中包括占有他人剩余劳动的雇工剥削收入和不占有他人劳动的非劳动收入，等等。因此，我们的分配政策，既要合理地拉开收入差距，反对平均主义；又要防止贫富悬殊，坚持共同富裕的社会主义方向。只有这样，才有利于调动广大劳动者的积极性，提高效率。当前，在我国现实经济生活中分配不公的问题，主要表现在复杂劳动与简单劳动、脑力劳动与体力劳动“倒挂”现象，影响企事业单位职工的积极性，占有他人剩余劳动的非劳动收入与劳动收入的差距在扩大，某些个体劳动者的收入与按劳分配的职工的收入差距偏大，社会上出现了一些以非法收入为主要来源的“暴发户”，引起群众的强烈不满。上述这些矛盾造成了人们心理上的不平衡，形成社会上的一个不安定因素。分配问题直接关系着广大劳动者的切身利益，社会上的各种矛盾、磨擦以至冲突，往往同社会上分配不公的问题有着这样或那样的联系。所以，要创造一个持久的稳定的经济环境，还必须有领导有步骤地切实解决分配不公的问题。
      保持经济持续稳定协调发展，还必须把治理整顿和深化改革结合起来。治理整顿是在改革开放总方向的前提下进行的。治理整顿不仅为改革深入和健康地进行创造必要的条件，而且它本身也需要改革的配合。治理经济环境，控制通货膨胀，努力缓解社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾，把通货膨胀率逐步下降到
  10％以下，这是为深化改革创造必不可少的条件。同时，在治理整顿过程中，要调整和完善已有的改革措施，巩固和发展改革已经取得的成果。我们要坚持计划经济与市场调节相结合的原则，既不搞过去那种完全的计划经济，以免统得过多过死；也不能完全实行市场经济，以免导致经济生活和整个社会生活的混乱。在治理整顿期间，要多一点计划性，适当地加强集中，这是在发挥地方积极性基础上的集中，而不是否定地方企业必要的自主权的过分集中。在继续搞活微观经济的同时，逐步建立能够促进经济稳定发展的宏观调控体系。
    保持政策的稳定性和连续性，也是稳定经济的一个非常重要的问题。我们要继续坚持以公有制为主体，发展多种经济成分，继续稳定和完善农村家庭联产承包责任制和工业企业承包责任制，正确地处理国家、企业、个人三者之间的关系，目前利益与长远利益的关系。政策稳定，才能稳定人心，才能保持广大人民的积极性长久不衰。
      建设高度的社会主义民主和完备的法制
    建设高度的社会主义民主和完备的法制，是我国的社会主义现代化建设一项根本任务。没有民主就没有社会主义。社会主义民主是建立在生产资料公有制基础上的社会主义政治上层建筑，也是社会主义社会的本质特征之一。因为，生产资料公有化和生产社会化，必然要求政治的民主化。在社会主义制度下，人民不但需要富裕的物质生活和文明的精神生活，而且需要民主的政治生活。生气勃勃的创造性的社会主义事业是由人民群众创立的，只有依靠群众，才能取得社会主义建设的全面胜利。
    社会主义民主政治是国体和政体的统一。社会主义民主政治作为国体，就是社会主义国家全体人民当家做主，共同享有生产资料的不同形式的所有权和支配权，并在这个基础上，享有管理国家的权力。我们国家实行人民民主专政的政治制度，绝大多数人民享有最广泛的民主，只对极少数敌对分子实行专政。社会主义民主政治作为政体就是人民行使管理国家政权的组织结构与形式。我国实行的人民代表大会制，体现了在人民内部民主与集中的统一。极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人，高唱“政治民主化”，但是，他们主张的是不要人民民主专政的民主，不要共产党领导的民主。这决不是社会主义民主，而只能是资产阶级的民主。
    社会主义民主有一个不断完善的过程。民主要不断发展，又要逐步完善。社会主义民主政治的发展程度直接取决于社会经济和文化发展水平。目前，我们必须建立和健全实现社会主义民主的机制，它包括：决策科学化和民主化——决策严格靠群体的智慧和能力，使决策活动的主体群体化；要建立决策活动的组织结构和程序，使决策活动组织结构化；议政机制——使人民能够享有通过各种形式广泛地了解国家大事的权利，有一定的场所让人民议政，有反映人民意见的畅通渠道；参与机构——要增强和提高人民的参与意识，并且通过不同的组织形式，使不同阶层的人们实现参与对国家各种具体事务的管理；监督机制——在国家机器的运行中，广大人民要对国家公务人员进行有效的监督，保证国家机器的各个环节高效率运行，防止和克服国家公务人员产生的官僚主义、以权谋私，以及各种腐败现象，防止“从社会公仆变为社会主人”。
      加强社会主义法制建设，才能创造一个稳定的国内政治环境。加强法制建设，就是建立以宪法为基础的法律体系，把人民的政治生活、经济生活、文化生活和社会生活纳入法制的轨道。法律建设还包括向人民进行普法教育，增强法制观念，养成遵纪守法的习惯。
    社会主义民主和社会主义法制是相互依存，密不可分的。社会主义民主是社会主义法制的前提和基础，社会主义法制是社会主义民主的体现和保障。要使社会主义民主制度化、法律化，以保证人民民主权利的行使和实现，使人民的民主权利受到法律的保护。社会主义的民主离不开社会主义法制，离开了社会主义法制的民主，就会破坏国家的民主制度、人民正常的民主生活和人民民主权利。同样，离开社会主义民主，就没有社会主义法制。只有把社会主义民主建设和社会主义法制建设紧密结合为一体，才能巩固人民民主专政，才能为社会主义建设和改革开放创造长期稳定的社会环境。社会主义民主和法制的完备程度，是社会主义制度发展成熟程度的一个重要标志。
    加强思想政治工作
      树立坚强的精神支柱
    保持稳定的社会环境，是党的事业和全国各族人民根本利益之所在。为此，需要动员全党和全国各族人民为我国社会环境的稳定而奋斗，这就需要加强思想政治工作，把爱国主义、集体主义和共产主义远大理想，作为我国各族人民，同心同德建设社会主义强国的主要精神支柱。
    第一，爱国主义。列宁指出：“爱国主义就是千百年来固定下来的对自己的祖国的一种最深厚的感情。”一百多年以来，由于中华民族长期受帝国主义的侵略，中国人民有着爱国主义的光荣传统。在民族民主革命时期，中华民族的优秀儿女，在中国共产党领导下前仆后继，英勇牺牲，创建了一个独立、自由、民主的中华人民共和国。在社会主义时期，爱国主义主要表现在为维护社会主义的人民共和国的独立和尊严，为祖国各民族的繁荣昌盛，为“实现四化，振兴中华”而献身。50年代初期，在我国经济刚刚恢复战争创伤的时候，一批留美学者和学生，冲破重重阻挠，毅然返回祖国参加社会主义建设，谱写了爱国主义的篇章。近些年来，不少中青年知识分子出国留学和进修取得了优异的成绩，他们放弃了国外优厚待遇，把毕生事业与振兴祖国联系起来。“我的事业在祖国”，表达了他们崇高的爱国主义精神。爱国主义是具有伟大号召力的一面旗帜，它在我国各族人民悠久历史文化的基础上产生巨大的凝聚力和向心力，它是动员和团结全国各族人民的思想基础。爱国主义是维护安定团结的重要精神支柱之一。爱国主义教育应当在各族人民中间普及，通过各种形式使之深入人心，形成中华民族和中国人民的美德。
    第二，集体主义。我们是社会主义国家，占主导地位的经济基础是社会主义公有制。公有制的经济基础要求建立与之相适应的观念形态——集体主义。有些人鼓吹个人主义，以自我为中心的“个人至上论”，这种意识形态是同我国经济基础格格不入的。集体主义是处理社会主义社会人与人之间、个人与集体之间的基本准则。集体主义是一种崇高的思想境界，要求人们具有共同的理想，高尚的情操和职业道德，严格的组织纪律观念。
    在集体主义思想的基础上，树立科学的价值观，也就是正确地处理个人和社会的关系。马克思说：“‘价值’这个普遍概念是从人们对待满足他们需要的外界物的关系中产生的。”价值反映的是人的主体需要与满足这种需要的客体对象之间的关系。人是社会的主体。作为主体的人，要从社会中获得他应有的地位和满足个人生存和发展的物质生活和文化生活的需要，以实现人的自我价值；同时，人也是社会的客体，作为客体的人，也应当满足社会的需要，对社会做出贡献，以实现人的社会价值。因此，人的价值应当是自我价值与社会价值的统一，它包括两个方面：一是社会对个人地位的尊重和需求的满足，一是个人对社会的奉献。人的价值的公式＝奉献∶索取。这就是说，一个人的价值，是由他的“奉献”和“索取”的比值来确定的。这就是科学社会主义的人的价值观。
    第三，共产主义理想。理想是人们的信仰、向往和追求的奋斗目标。共产主义理想是辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义世界观的集中体现，是支配人们行动的强大的精神支柱。建设有中国特色的社会主义，实现社会主义现代化，这是我国各族人民的共同理想。中国共产党的最高理想是实现共产主义。无论过去、现在和将来，这个最高理想都是共产党人和先进分子的力量源泉，也是我们国家和民族的一个非常重要的精神支柱。
    共产主义不再是抽象的理想，而是经实践检验过的科学真理。从16世纪到19世纪初，空想社会主义、共产主义经历了四百多年的探索，由于马克思的两大发现——唯物主义历史观和剩余价值学说，并找到了推翻资本主义的社会力量——无产阶级，实现了人类认识史上的一个伟大的飞跃，使社会主义、共产主义由空想变成了科学。从1871年的巴黎公社建立无产阶级专政的尝试，到俄国、中国和一系列国家社会主义革命的伟大胜利，共产主义由一种科学的思想体系，由一种革命的共产主义运动，变成了一种正在成长中的崭新的社会制度——社会主义。社会主义是共产主义的初级阶段，我们现在执行的是社会主义的政策，但它是以共产主义思想为指导的，两者既有区别又有联系。在社会主义时期，我们也并不要求全国人民都必须树立共产主义理想，一种信仰、信念是自觉自愿的。但是，我们必须扩大共产主义的宣传，因为它代表了人类社会发展的未来，代表了人民群众长远的利益和美好的愿望。在共产党人、先进分子中间实践共产主义理想，使共产主义理想之光普照到社会上，对广大人民必然产生巨大的鼓舞，并形成一种巨大的不可估量的精神力量。所以，共产主义理想也是建设社会主义的一个非常重要的精神支柱。
    我们之所以创造一个长期稳定的社会环境，归结到一点上，就是大力发展生产力，不断增加社会产品的总量，在这个基础上使国家日益富强起来，使人民物质文化生活日益提高，从根本上保证我们国家的长治久安。
