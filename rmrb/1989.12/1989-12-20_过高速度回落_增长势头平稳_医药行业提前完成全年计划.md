The pharmaceutical industry nationwide has overcome difficulties related to shortages of raw materials, energy, and funds, and has completed this year's production and sales plan ahead of schedule by 20 days, according to information obtained by reporter Wang Jinhu from relevant departments.

It is understood that by the end of the year, the total industrial output value of the pharmaceutical industry can reach 2.26 billion yuan, an increase of 4.4% compared to last year; the total sales revenue of pharmaceuticals can reach 1.514 billion yuan, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year.

Compared to previous years, the growth rate of China's pharmaceutical production, which was previously too high, has significantly slowed down, maintaining a steady growth momentum. The pharmaceutical market is becoming more stable, with the supply-demand contradiction for therapeutic drugs beginning to ease, and the overheated sales situation for tonic drugs has also cooled down.
