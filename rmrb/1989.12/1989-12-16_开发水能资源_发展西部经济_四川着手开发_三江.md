After long-term surveys, explorations, and planning, Sichuan Province is now initiating the development of hydropower resources in the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River, collectively known as the "Three Rivers." Experts recently gathered in Beijing for the "Three Rivers" Hydropower Comprehensive Survey Report Meeting and told reporters that this initiative will significantly promote the economic development of Sichuan and the entire western region, helping to balance the economic development between eastern and western China.

According to reports, the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River, with their elevation drops mostly exceeding 2000-3000 meters and annual runoff equivalent to four Yellow Rivers, have concentrated hydropower resources in Sichuan's western region of over 260,000 square kilometers. These resources are comparable to the combined hydropower potential of 15 provinces and municipalities in Northeast, East China, and Central South China. The hydropower resource density is 155.28 million kilowatt-hours.

To revitalize the economy of the "Three Rivers" basin and drive the economic development of Sichuan and the entire western region, the state has planned to build three major hydropower bases along the main streams of the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River. These bases will construct over 50 cascading power stations with a total installed capacity of 98.88 million kilowatts, arranged from downstream to upstream.

Currently, apart from the already completed Gongzui Power Station on the Dadu River, the ongoing construction of Tongzilin Power Station, and the soon-to-be-started Ertan Power Station, the remaining large and medium-sized cascading power stations have completed over 170,000 meters of drilling, over 30,000 meters of tunnel exploration, and a significant amount of planning, design, and research work. Relevant departments are accelerating the preparatory work.

    开发水能资源　发展西部经济
    四川着手开发“三江”
    据新华社北京12月15日电（记者熊金超）经过长时间的考察、勘探和规划，四川省正着手开发金沙江、雅砻江、大渡河“三江”水能资源。有关专家日前在此间召开的“三江”水电综合考察汇报会上对记者说，这将极大地推动四川及整个西部的经济的发展，促进我国东西部经济的平衡。
    据介绍，落差多在2000—3000米以上、年径流量相当于四条黄河的金沙江、雅砻江和大渡河，在四川西部26万多平方公里的土地上集中了相当于我国东北、华东、中南三大地区15个省市的可开发水能资源，其水能资源密度为155.28万千瓦小时。
    为了振兴“三江”流域经济，带动四川及整个西部经济的发展，国家已规划在金沙江、雅砻江、大渡河干流开发兴建三个大型水电基地，分别自下而上建造总装机容量达9888万千瓦的50多个梯级电站。
    目前，这三个水电基地除已经建成的大渡河龚咀电站、正在兴建的铜街子电站和即将动工的二滩电站外，其余的大中型梯级电站，已完成钻探17万余米、洞探3万多米及大量的规划、设计、科研工作。有关方面正加紧开展前期准备工作。
