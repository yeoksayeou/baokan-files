The procurement of agricultural and sideline products has entered its peak season, and the supply of procurement funds has become a focal point of concern for all parties. From January to November, the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) cumulatively issued 14.92 billion yuan in loans for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, an increase of 1.6 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. By the end of November, the contracted procurement task for grains had been completed by 86.6%, and the negotiated procurement had completed 61.1% of the plan. The procurement of grains this year was 4.35 million tons more than the same period last year; the procurement of cotton had completed 57% of the plan; and the procurement of other agricultural and sideline products had also seen significant increases. Although the procurement loans this year have increased significantly, why are there still reports of shortages in procurement funds from various localities? An ABC official responded to the reporter that due to the impact of the overall economic situation, the bank's funds are still quite tight. The main reasons are the slow turnover of agricultural and sideline products, the delay in settling accounts after turnover, the poor cash flow of enterprises, and the increasing arrears in fiscal allocations. By the end of October, the total amount of accounts receivable for all grain enterprises had reached 1.559 billion yuan, an increase of 575.3 million yuan compared to the same period last year; the total amount of fiscal arrears had reached 829.1 million yuan, an increase of 517.4 million yuan compared to the same period last year. These factors have occupied a large amount of the bank's credit funds.

December is the peak month for the year's procurement, and the contradiction between supply and demand for funds will be even more prominent. The ABC appeals to all relevant parties to prioritize the bigger picture, strengthen cooperation, and ensure that commercial departments promptly procure and turn over goods; relevant departments promptly return the goods money; and fiscal departments promptly allocate the funds that should be allocated, working together to ensure that the agricultural and sideline products in hand are procured.

    收购资金虽增　各地仍有缺口
    农行呼吁各方共保农产品收购
    本报北京12月12日讯　记者江夏报道：目前农副产品收购已进入旺季，收购资金的供应情况为各方关注。1—11月，农行累计发放农副产品收购贷款1492亿元，比去年同期多放160亿元。到11月末粮食合同定购任务已经完成86.6％，议购完成计划的61.1％，粮食比去
  年同期多收购435万吨；棉花收购完成计划的57％；其他农副
  产品收购均有较大幅度的增长。今年收购贷款增长较多，为何各地仍不断传来收购资金有缺口的呼声？农行有关人士就此回答记者，由于受到整个经济形势的影响，农业银行资金仍相当紧张。主要原因是农副产品调销缓慢，调销后货款不能及时结算，企业资金周转不灵，财政各项欠拨补逐月增加。到10月末，全部粮食企业各项应收货款达155.9亿元，比去年同期增加了57.53亿元；各项财政性欠拨款达82.91亿元，比去年同期增加51.74亿元，这些都占用着银行大量的信贷资金。
    12月是全年收购的最高峰，资金供需矛盾将更加突出。农行呼吁各有关方面以大局为重，加强协作，商业部门及时收购、及时调销；有关部门及时归还货款；财政部门及时拨补应拨款项，共同努力，千方百计把到手的农副产品收上来。
