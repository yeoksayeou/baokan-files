To adapt to the current urban development situation, the 11th session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress promulgated the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Urban Residents' Committees." The promulgation and implementation of this law mark the entry of the construction of urban residents' committees in China into a new historical development stage.

Cities are the centers of China's economy, politics, science, technology, and cultural education, playing a leading role in socialist modernization. Residents' committees are the cells of China's political power, the grassroots mass self-governing organizations in cities, and the bridge and bond between the Party and the government and the broad masses of residents. Building strong residents' committees is of great significance for uniting, mobilizing, and leading the broad masses of residents, consolidating and developing a stable and united political situation, completing the tasks of rectification and deepening reform, promoting the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization in cities, and building China into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country as soon as possible.

China is a socialist country where the people are the masters. Fully implementing the people's right to be masters in grassroots political power and grassroots social life is an important aspect of building a high level of socialist democracy and is also an important guarantee for the prosperity and long-term stability of our country. Practice has proven that implementing residents' self-governance is beneficial for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of residents, cultivating residents' democratic consciousness and habits, strengthening the connection between the government and the people, promoting the development and stability of the grassroots, and advancing the process of socialist democratic construction. In the future, we must strictly implement the provisions of the "Law on Urban Residents' Committees," through unremitting efforts, bring the work of residents' committees into the track of institutionalization and legalization, and build residents' committees into grassroots mass self-governing organizations for self-management, self-education, and self-service.

It must be made clear that residents' committees must implement self-governance under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, must implement self-governance on the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, and must implement self-governance within the scope of state laws and policies. Therefore, residents' committees must accept the leadership of grassroots Party organizations and the leadership or guidance of grassroots people's governments and their dispatched agencies, and consciously assist grassroots people's governments and their dispatched agencies in completing various tasks.

Strengthening the leadership of the construction and work of residents' committees is the key to doing a good job in the work of residents' committees. Party committees and people's governments at all levels, especially municipal and district people's governments and their dispatched agencies—street offices, must attach great importance to the construction of residents' committees, include the construction of residents' committees in the important agenda, and truly regard it as an important work in the city. Efforts must be made to strengthen the construction of the leadership teams of residents' committees, open up multiple channels for the recruitment of residents' committee cadres, and continuously improve their political and professional qualities. Currently, there are nearly 100,000 residents' committees in China, with more than 360,000 residents' committee cadres. Their sense of honor and responsibility must be enhanced, and their work and life difficulties must be properly solved. Their work must be cared for and supported. For those residents' committees that have no one to take responsibility and are in a state of disintegration, effective measures must be taken to quickly rectify them and change their appearance. In short, through solid work, we must strengthen the construction of residents' committees and give full play to the role of residents' committees in socialist modernization.

    把城市居民委员会建设好
    本报评论员
    为适应当前城市形势发展的需要，第七届全国人大常委会第11次会议通过颁布了《中华人民共和国城市居民委员会组织法》。此法的颁布施行，标志着我国城市居民委员会的建设进入一个新的历史发展阶段。
    城市是我国经济、政治、科学、技术、文化教育的中心，在社会主义现代化建设中起着主导作用。居民委员会是我国政权肌体的细胞，是城市基层群众性自治组织，是党和政府联系广大居民群众的桥梁和纽带。把居民委员会建设好，对于团结、动员和带领广大居民群众，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，完成治理整顿和深化改革的任务，促进城市的社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设，把我国尽快建设成富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家，具有十分重要的意义。
    我国是人民当家作主的社会主义国家。在基层政权和基层社会生活中充分实行人民当家作主的权利，是建设高度的社会主义民主的一个重要方面，也是我们国家兴旺发达、长治久安的重要保证。实践证明，实行居民自治，有利于调动广大居民的积极性，有利于培养居民的民主意识和民主习惯，有利于密切政府同人民群众之间的联系，有利于基层的发展和稳定，有利于社会主义民主建设的进程。今后，要切实按照《居委会组织法》的规定，通过不懈的努力，把居委会工作纳入制度化、法律化的轨道，把居民委员会建设成为居民自我管理、自我教育、自我服务的基层群众性自治组织。
    必须明确，居民委员会必须在中国共产党的领导下实行自治，必须在坚持四项基本原则的前提下实行自治，是在国家法律和政策规定的范围内的自治。因此，居民委员会必须接受基层党组织的领导，接受基层人民政府及其派出机关的领导或指导，自觉地协助基层人民政府及其派出机关完成各项工作任务。
    加强对居委会建设和工作的领导，是做好居委会工作的关键。各级党委和人民政府特别是市、市辖区人民政府及其派出机关——街道办事处，都要高度重视居委会的建设，把居委会建设列入重要议事日程，切实当作城市的一项重要工作来抓。要加强居委会领导班子的建设，多方开辟居委会干部的来源，不断提高他们的政治素质和业务素质。目前我国已有居委会近10万个，居委会干部36万多人，要提高他们的光荣感和责任感，妥善解决他们的工作和生活中的困难，关心、支持他们的工作。对于那些工作无人负责，处于涣散状态的居委会，要采取有效措施，迅速进行整顿，使之改变面貌。总之，要通过扎扎实实的工作，大力加强居委会的建设，充分发挥居委会在社会主义现代化建设中的作用。
