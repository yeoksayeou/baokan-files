The illegal trafficking of children to the United States and Europe has caused serious concern in Latin American society.

In September of this year, Paraguayan President General Rodriguez revealed to a radio station that approximately ten Paraguayan children are trafficked to the United States each week, with each transaction costing $7,000. Recently, Argentina's "Somos" magazine reported that hundreds of Argentine infants have been sold to Europe and the United States, with prices varying by individual, reaching as high as $20,000. A Guatemalan organization admitted that the illegal trafficking of Guatemalan children out of the country is estimated to yield over $20 million annually. In Ecuador, in 1988, 1,000 children were trafficked abroad, with traffickers earning $1,000 to $5,000 per child.

Even more shocking is the recent increase in cases where organs from trafficked children are used for transplants. The Honduran Social Welfare Commission exposed that some children sold abroad have had their corneas, eyeballs, hearts, kidneys, and other organs transplanted into the children of wealthy individuals. In some Latin American countries, underground "nurseries" run by Israelis and Europeans engaged in human trafficking have also been discovered.

Many official institutions and humanitarian organizations in Latin American countries have called for measures to eradicate this phenomenon. Some governments have taken corresponding actions. For example, Mexico this year increased penalties for crimes involving the kidnapping of children to be sold into prostitution or for medical experiments in the United States. Although some Latin American countries have repeatedly exposed these evil dealings, they have not attracted the attention of the United States and Europe, let alone any measures to suppress them. Moreover, Latin American legislation lacks provisions for punishing such crimes, allowing human traffickers to exploit these loopholes.

    罪恶的交易—拐卖儿童
    非法拐卖儿童到美国和欧洲的罪恶交易，引起了拉美社会舆论的严重不安。
    今年九月，巴拉圭总统罗德里格斯将军向一家电台披露，每星期大约有十名巴拉圭儿童被拐卖到美国，每个收费七千美元。阿根廷的《索莫斯》杂志最近报道，有几百名阿根廷婴儿被转卖到欧洲和美国，价格因人而定，最高可达到两万美元。危地马拉一个机构承认，把危地马拉儿童非法带出国的交易估计每年获利两千多万美元。在厄瓜多尔，一九八八年有一千名儿童被拐卖出国，人口贩子从每个孩子身上可得到一千至五千美元。
    更令人发指的是，近年来取用拐卖儿童的器官进行移植的情况增多。洪都拉斯社会福利委员会揭露，一些被卖到国外的孩子的角膜、眼球、心脏、肾及其他器官被移植到一些有钱人的孩子身上。在一些拉美国家，还发现有以色列人和欧洲人开办的从事人口交易的地下“育婴堂”。
    许多拉美国家的官方机构和人道主义组织呼吁采取措施，根除这种现象。一些国家政府采取了相应措施。如墨西哥今年对绑架儿童去当妓女和卖到美国进行医学试验的犯罪案件，加重了刑罚。虽然一些拉美国家多次揭露了这种罪恶的交易，但并没有引起美国和欧洲的重视，更谈不上采取措施来加以取缔。而拉美国家立法中尚没有关于这类罪行的惩处规定，也让人口贩子钻了空子。
