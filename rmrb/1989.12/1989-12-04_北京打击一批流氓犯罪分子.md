Beijing's judicial authorities have taken action to eliminate social hazards by severely punishing a group of serious hooligan criminals on November 30. Hooligan criminal Liu Baode was executed by firing squad.

Criminal Liu Baode, along with three others, was drinking in a restaurant in Fengtai Town and harassed a young woman at a nearby table. When they were rebuked and stopped by a bystander, Huang Tianming, Liu Baode and the others attacked and beat him. After being punched by Liu Baode, Huang Tianming suffered a fractured skull and brainstem injury, and died on the spot.

Hooligan criminals Li Jin and Ma Geng once engaged in a brawl with another group of hooligans at the Dong Restaurant in Jiuxianqiao Town, armed with razors and firecrackers. Li Jin stabbed one of the opponents in the back with a razor, killing him on the spot.

The Beijing Intermediate People's Court sentenced Li Jin to death, deprived him of political rights for life, and sentenced Ma Geng to 15 years in prison, depriving him of political rights for 3 years.
