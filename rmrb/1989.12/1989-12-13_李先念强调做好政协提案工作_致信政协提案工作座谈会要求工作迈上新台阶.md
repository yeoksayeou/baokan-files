The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a meeting on proposals today in Beijing. The meeting aimed to summarize the basic experiences of proposal work since 1985, discuss and study new situations and problems in proposal work, unify understanding, and clarify the basic guidelines for proposal work in the coming period.

Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, sent a congratulatory letter to the meeting. In the letter, he emphasized that proposal work is an important aspect of the CPPCC's political consultation and democratic supervision functions. Doing a good job in proposal work is crucial for mobilizing the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, developing the patriotic united front, and promoting reform and opening up and socialist modernization. He hoped to continuously enrich and improve the various systems of proposal work, improve quality and efficiency, make proposal work more standardized, and take it to a new level to better serve the rectification and deepening of reform and the construction of socialist spiritual and material civilization.

It is understood that in the past five years, the National Committee of the CPPCC has received 9,158 proposals from its members, covering areas such as politics, economy, science and technology, health, culture, education, energy, and transportation. Currently, about one-third of these proposals have been adopted and implemented.

Program Zhiyao, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Proposals Committee, said at the meeting that the proposals from CPPCC members are different from ordinary letters to the people and from speeches made by members at various meetings. They are proposals and suggestions reviewed by the Proposals Committee and submitted to relevant departments for handling, with a requirement for a response within a certain time limit. Therefore, improving the quality of proposals from CPPCC members is the key to pushing proposal work to a new stage.

Program Zhiyao said that in the past five years, proposal work at all levels of the CPPCC has made significant progress. Members are highly enthusiastic, and the number of proposals has increased significantly. The quality of members' proposals has also improved. Now, proposals from CPPCC members have become an important way and channel to promote socialist democracy, and are increasingly valued by parties and governments at all levels. The situation of handling proposals over the years shows that proposals related to the major policies and important issues of the Party and the state, local major affairs, and important issues in people's lives are mostly valued by relevant departments and units. This type of proposal accounts for about one-third of the total number of proposals.

Vice Chairpersons of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Fang Yi and Kang Keqing, attended the meeting.

    李先念强调做好政协提案工作
    致信政协提案工作座谈会要求工作迈上新台阶
    本报北京12月12日讯　记者李德金报道：全国政协提案工作座谈会今天在京举行。这次会议旨在总结1985年以来提案工作的基本经验，讨论、研究提案工作的新情况和新问题，统一认识，明确今后一段时期内提案工作的基本方针。
    全国政协主席李先念给会议写来了贺信。他在贺信中强调，提案工作是人民政协的一项重要工作，它是人民政协行使政治协商、民主监督职能的一个重要方面，做好提案工作对调动各方面人士的积极性、发展爱国统一战线、推进改革开放和社会主义现代化建设具有重要意义。他希望不断充实和完善提案工作的各项制度，提高质量，提高效益，使提案工作进一步规范化，迈上新台阶，更好地为治理整顿、深化改革和社会主义精神和物质文明建设服务。
    据了解，近5年来，全国政协共受理委员提案9158件，内容涉及政治、经济、科技卫生、文化教育、能源、交通等领域。目前，这些提案已有1／3被采纳实施。
    全国政协副主席、提案委员会主任程思远在座谈会上说，政协委员提案不同于一般的人民来信，也不同于委员在各种会议上的发言，它是经过提案委员会审查，交付有关部门办理，并要求在一定时限内向委员作出交代的书面意见和建议。因此，提高政协委员提案的质量，是能否把提案工作推向新阶段的关键。
    程思远说，5年来，全国各级政协提案工作有很大发展。委员积极性高涨，提案数量大幅度增长。委员提案的质量也有所提高。现在，政协委员提案已成为发扬社会主义民主的一个重要方式和渠道，日益受到各级党和政府的重视。多年来提案办理的情况表明，凡是围绕党和国家大政方针、地方重大事务和群众生活的重要问题的提案，大多受到有关部门和单位的重视，这类提案大体占提案总数的1／3左右。
    全国政协副主席方毅、康克清等出席了座谈会。
