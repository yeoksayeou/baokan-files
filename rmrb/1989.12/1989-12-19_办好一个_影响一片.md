Doing well one foreign-invested enterprise can influence a wide area. Doing well the existing foreign-invested enterprises is an important link in further improving the work of attracting foreign investment.

Facts speak louder than words. Doing well one can influence a wide area, doing well one can attract a series. Currently, there are more than 8,000 foreign-invested enterprises that have started production, and doing well these enterprises will produce tremendous attraction.

It is entirely possible to do well. Rectifying the economic order and improving the economic environment can provide a better operating environment for the existing foreign-invested enterprises, allowing them to operate freely. Of course, we do not deny that in the process of rectification and improvement, and before the economy is fully straightened out, there will inevitably be some difficulties in capital turnover, raw material supply, sales, and other aspects. In this regard, relevant departments at all levels should take it seriously and do their best to help the foreign-invested enterprises that have started production to solve urgent problems. It is also the duty of the Chinese partners to do their best together with the foreign partners to run the enterprises well.

For foreign investors, they should also look further ahead. Smooth sailing is often rare. Generally speaking, the risk of investing in China is relatively small, and one should not be confused or lose confidence by some temporary problems. The Japanese female deputy chairman and deputy general manager, Asai Yoneko, said well: "I believe in China's policy." This shows the courage that an entrepreneur should have.

### 办好一个　影响一片

    办好一个　影响一片
    办好现有外商直接投资企业，是进一步做好吸收外资工作的重要一环。
    事实最具说服力，办好一个能影响一片，办好一个能引来一串。目前已投产的外资企业达8000多家，办好将产生巨大的吸引力。
    办好是完全有可能的。整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境可以为现有外资企业提供较好的经营环境，使之放开手脚去干。当然，我们并不讳言，在整顿治理过程中，在经济还没有理顺以前，不可避免地会在资金周转、原材料供应、销售等方面碰到一些困难。对此，各地有关方面要认真对待，尽可能帮助已经投产的外资企业解决燃眉之急。中方合作者竭尽全力和外方一道把企业办好，更是责无旁贷的。
    对外国投资者来说，也要把眼光放远一点。一帆风顺的事往往是没有的。总的来讲，在中国投资的风险性还是比较小的，不要被眼前的一些问题所困惑甚至丧失信心。日籍女副董事长兼副总经理浅井米子说的好：“我相信中国的政策。”这表现了一个企业家应有的胆识。
