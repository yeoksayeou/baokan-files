In the spirit of sincere cooperation and mutual promotion, the sports commission directors and heads of training and competition departments from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Hainan recently held a sports cooperation conference in Yichang, Hubei.

The attendees agreed that the sports industry in the Central South region is developing rapidly. Over the past few years, the region has nurtured and sent a batch of outstanding athletes to the nation, producing numerous world-class athletes who have achieved excellent results in national, Asian, and global competitions, bringing honor to the motherland. To further promote the development of sports in the Central South region and cultivate more high-level athletes for the nation, the sports commissions of the six provinces and autonomous regions discussed and decided to strengthen cooperation in the future, formulating five specific measures.

First, to exchange research findings without secrecy and promptly share them among the provinces and autonomous regions. Second, to leverage the strengths of each province, organizing large-scale joint training sessions. Guangdong will lead the training for men's and women's short-distance running, Hunan for gymnastics, Henan for shooting, Hubei for rowing, and Guangxi and Hainan will also lead training in some strong events. Third, to exchange talents, share resources, and jointly cultivate excellent reserve athletes. Fourth, in some projects approved by the State Sports Commission, to optimize the combination of provinces and compete together (in competitions). Fifth, for provinces that have invited foreign experts or coaches to teach, to notify each other so that all provinces in the Central South region can send representatives to listen in and benefit together.

    本报讯　本着真诚协作、互相促进的精神，最近，广东、广西、湖南、湖北、河南、海南六个省、自治区的体委主任及训练、竞赛等部门负责人，在湖北宜昌市召开了中南地区体育协作会议。
    与会代表认为中南地区体育事业发展势头很好，几年来为国家培养和输送了一批又一批优秀体育人才，涌现出不少在全国、亚洲和世界大赛中取得优异成绩的世界级选手，为祖国争得了荣誉。为了进一步促进中南地区的体育工作，为国家培养更多的高水平体育人才，六省区体委通过认真讨论，决定今后进一步加强协作，制定了5项具体措施。
    第一，协作交流科研成果。各省区体委在科研方面取得的成果互不保密，及时交流。第二，发挥各省优势，组织大区联合集训。广东牵头男女短跑集训，湖南牵头体操集训，河南牵头射击集训，湖北牵头赛艇集训，广西和海南也将负责一些优项的牵头集训。第三，交流人才，互通有无，共同培养优秀后备人才。第四，在一些国家体委同意的项目上进行省与省之间的优化组合，联合起来参加竞争（比赛）。第五，凡聘请了外国专家或教练来华讲课的省，都相互通告，以便中南各省区都能派人旁听，共同受益。　（钱　澄）
