Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 11th.

Staff from the Institute of Archaeology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences recently unearthed a batch of artifacts dating back over 4,000 years in Linqu County, Shandong Province.

The two ancient tombs excavated this time are located six kilometers south of Linqu City on a high terrace. They are burial sites from the late period of the Longshan Culture during the patriarchal clan era, dating back over 4,000 years. In the two adjacent tombs, more than a hundred artifacts, including various stone tools, pottery, bone tools, and jade artifacts, have been unearthed. Among them, more than ten jade artifacts such as jade knives, jade spades, jade rings, jade pendants, and jade hairpins are exquisitely crafted and finely carved. The large areas of clear and vivid paintings in the tombs are rare for tombs of the same period.

Professor Han Rong, who led the excavation, believes that the scale of these two ancient tombs, the quantity of precious artifacts unearthed, and the exquisite craftsmanship of the jade artifacts are unparalleled by other Longshan Culture burial sites. This batch of artifacts is of great significance for the study of the origins of the state, the origins of civilization, and prehistoric arts and crafts.

    临朐出土一批文物
    距今达四千年以上
    新华社济南十二月十一日电　（通讯员吕传富、记者傅洪德）中国社会科学院考古研究所的工作人员，新近在山东临朐县发掘出一批四千多年前的文物。
    这次发掘的两座古墓在临朐城南六公里处的高土台上，系龙山文化晚期父系氏族时代墓葬，距今四千年以上。在相距咫尺的两座墓穴中，已发掘出多种石器、陶器、骨器和玉器等陪葬品上百件。其中玉刀、玉铲、玉环、玉佩、玉簪等十多件玉器，造型优美，雕琢精细。墓中清晰可辨的较大面积彩绘，更为同时代墓葬所罕见。
    主持发掘工作的韩榕副教授认为，这两座古墓规模之大，出土珍品数量之多，玉器制作之精巧，都非其他龙山文化遗址墓葬所能比。这批文物对研究国家起源、文明起源以及史前工艺、美术等，具有重要价值。
