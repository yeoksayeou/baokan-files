College graduate Yu Guiru takes root in the mountains, helping local farmers remove their poverty hats.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 16th: (Correspondents Hu Youheng, Guo Zhongli) Yu Guiru, a graduate of Shanxi Agricultural University, wrote an 80,000-word research paper titled "Comprehensive Agricultural Development Plan for Wuzhai County," which won the first prize for theoretical advancement in science and technology in Shanxi Province. He then voluntarily applied to work in Wuzhai County's Xinglingzi Township to put his theories into practice. As a result, the per capita income of the township increased from over 80 yuan in 1985 to over 1,000 yuan, successfully removing the poverty label.

Yu Guiru is now 37 years old. After graduating from the Department of Agriculture at Shanxi Agricultural University in 1975, he once worked at the technical station in Wuzhai County, Shanxi. In 1985, when he took up the position of Party Secretary of Xinglingzi Township, the per capita grain yield in the township was only 120 kilograms per mu, and the per capita income was just over 80 yuan.

    据新华社太原十二月十六日电  （通讯员胡有恒、郭忠礼）山西农业大学毕业生尤贵如，写出八万多字的《五寨县农业总体规划》研究论文，荣获山西省科技进步理论一等奖后，主动申请到五寨县杏岭子乡实践自己的理论，使这个乡人均收入由一九八五年的八十余元上升到一千多元，一举摘掉贫困帽。
    尤贵如今年三十七岁，一九七五年从山西农业大学农业系毕业后，曾到山西五寨县技术站实践。一九八五年，当他来到杏岭子乡担任乡党委书记时，全乡粮食亩产只有一百二十公斤，人均收入仅八十余元。
