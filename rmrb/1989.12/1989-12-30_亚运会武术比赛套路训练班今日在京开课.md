Japan and South Korea have sent over 70 people to Beijing to participate in the Asian Games wushu competition routines training class, aiming to improve their technical skills and perform well in this event. The training class will officially begin on December 30 and end on January 6, 1990, with high-level coaches from the Chinese State Sports Commission's Wushu Academy providing the training.

The Japanese delegation includes members from over 20 wushu organizations in Tokyo, Osaka, and other cities. In the recently concluded second Asian Wushu Championships, Japanese and South Korean athletes achieved good results, further fueling their desire to compete for medals in the wushu events at next year's Asian Games.

They will meticulously teach the techniques of seven wushu events scheduled for the Asian Games: Taijiquan, Nanquan, Changquan, Daoshu, Jianshu, Qiangshu, and Gunshu.
