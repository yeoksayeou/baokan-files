Capital business leaders predict that the main trend for the consumer goods market next year will be stability. This is the consensus reached by leaders of some enterprises and managers of commercial outlets at a business forum held recently by the Ministry of Light Industry.

Regarding the market sales phenomena that have occurred this year, the attendees generally believe that the situation is basically normal. Although the market appears to have fluctuated significantly this year, with some products shifting from brisk sales to stagnation, this is actually a transition from the abnormal market trends of last year to a more normal state. It is also a necessary result of the implementation of the rectification and adjustment policies. Currently, the market shows two clear trends: the supply-demand relationship is becoming more stable, and the value and price of commodities are becoming more reasonable.

The overall trend for next year's market is stability: stable prices, stable supply-demand relationships, and stable consumer psychology. Attendees suggested that next year's market may experience "stability with prosperity, stability with risks, and stability with difficulties." The period before and after the Spring Festival is an annual peak in consumption, and the market will see a small-scale rebound. Events like the Asian Games next year may provide opportunities for market promotion. The market sluggishness of this year is expected to have a certain "rebound" next year, which is the reason for "stability with prosperity." The "stability with risks" is analyzed from the perspective of supply. In the latter half of this year, industrial enterprises generally operated below capacity, and some enterprises have explicitly proposed to limit production to curb price declines. These factors will affect the total output of products, and whether they can meet market demand is a concern. The "difficulties" arise from issues related to funds, raw materials, and sales, making it challenging for industrial enterprises to arrange production and for commercial outlets to manage inventory.

    首都工商界人士预测
    明年市场基调——平稳
    据新华社北京12月14日电　（记者杨理科）明年消费品市场的主基调：平稳。这是轻工业部目前召开的工商座谈会上首都部分企业领导人和商场经理的一致看法。
    就今年以来出现的市场销售现象，与会者普遍的看法是：基本正常。表面上看今年的市场似乎波动较大，部分产品由畅转滞，实际上这是去年市场的不正常走向逐步正常的过渡，也是治理整顿政策实施的必然结果。目前市场有两个明显趋向，一是供求关系趋于平稳，二是商品的价值和价格趋于合理。
    明年市场大趋势是稳定的：价格稳、供求关系稳、消费心理稳。与会者提出，明年市场不排除“稳中有旺、稳中有险、稳中有难”的可能性。春节前后是一年一度的消费高潮，市场会出现小规模回升，明年的亚运会等活动可能成为市场促销的契机，今年的市场疲势明年会有一定的“反弹”，这是稳中有旺的理由。稳中有险则是从货源角度分析，今年下半年工业企业普遍开工不足，少数企业明确提出以限产扼制价格下滑，这些都会影响产品总量的增加，能否满足市场需求，这是“险”的担心。
  “难”则由于资金、原材料、销售等原因，工业安排生产有顾虑，商业对市场把握不大，安排进货总量有难度。
