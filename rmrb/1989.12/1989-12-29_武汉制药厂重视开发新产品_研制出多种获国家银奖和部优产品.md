The Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory in Hubei Province places a strong emphasis on technological advancement and the development of new products. Over the past few years, the factory has successfully developed multiple products that have been awarded National Silver Awards and Ministry-Level Excellence Awards. Recently, the factory has produced a new high-efficiency antibacterial drug called Enoxacin, which has passed the inspection by the Ministry of Health. This makes Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory the third in the world, after Japan and the United States, to produce this type of drug.

Enoxacin, also known as Ofloxacin, was jointly developed by Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory and the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The factory broke away from traditional manufacturing techniques and used chemical methods to produce oral tablets and capsules. The effectiveness of this drug is significantly better than currently used antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin.
