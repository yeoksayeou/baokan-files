Do Not Use "Exclusive Operation" to Act Arbitrarily

Lín Bǎoquán

People from the countryside come to report a bumper harvest, but they also complain bitterly, saying that this year selling grain is like selling "dog shit." The staff at the grain depot are arrogant, and the quality inspectors sit there with their legs crossed, making the farmers who sell grain bring the grain bags to them one by one for inspection, acting like lords. Why is this? It turns out that because of the exclusive operation policy, grain can only be sold to the grain depot, and the depot takes advantage of this "control."

This year, major agricultural and sideline products have been changed to exclusive operation, which is beneficial for overcoming some of the problems of multi-channel operations. However, some new problems have also emerged, the most important of which are two: one is the serious problem of grade reduction and price reduction. In our area, the price of paddy rice has dropped from 0.8 yuan per kilogram at the beginning of the market to 0.68 yuan; after the exclusive operation of pigs, the price of fat pigs has dropped from 4.2 yuan per kilogram to 3.2-3.8 yuan despite the fact that the market price of pork has not dropped; the quality of red hemp is the best in recent years, but the purchase price has dropped from 1.6 yuan per kilogram to around 1.1 yuan. The second is the significant decline in service quality. Some employees of the exclusive operation units have once again adopted the attitude of "official merchants," and some even take advantage of "exclusive operation" to act arbitrarily, arbitrarily deducting water content and finding faults, delaying purchases and limiting purchases. The practice of issuing white payment vouchers has also increased. Farmers are very dissatisfied with this, but since there is "only this one store, no other branches," they have no choice but to sell painfully.

The problems that have arisen in exclusive operations should be highly valued by leaders at all levels. After the national rural work conference last year, through the hard work of all levels and parties, a warming trend in agriculture has finally emerged. The exclusive operation departments should start from the perspective of benefiting the country and the people, think carefully and act correctly, and use the "exclusive operation rights" correctly. They must not violate the purpose of exclusive operation, take advantage of "exclusive operation" to exploit farmers, and cheat farmers. Agriculture requires a lot of investment and has low returns, and achieving a bumper harvest is not easy. To develop agriculture, it is crucial to protect the enthusiasm of farmers for farming.

    莫借“专营”耍专横
    林保全
    乡下来人，喜报丰收，又叫苦不迭，说今年卖粮又像卖“狗屎”一样，粮库人员傲得不行，验质员坐在那儿跷着二郎腿，让售粮农民逐个将粮包送到面前验，一副老爷架势。何以如此？原来由于实行专营，粮食只能卖给粮库，粮库仗此“拿人”。
    今年，主要农副产品改为专营，这对于克服多渠道经营的某些弊病是有利的。但也出现了一些新问题，最主要的有两条：一是压级压价严重。我们这里稻谷议价收购由初上市的每公斤0.8元降至0.68元；生猪专营后，在猪肉市价未降的情况下，肥猪售价由每公斤4.2元降至3.2—3.8元；红麻质量是近几年最好的，而收购价却由过去的每公斤1.6元降至1.1元左右。二是服务质量明显下降。专营单位部分职工重又端起“官商”架子，有些甚至倚仗“专营”耍专横，随意扣水分，挑毛病，延购限购。付款打白条的事也多了起来。农民对此极为不满，可是“只此一家，别无分店”，没办法，只好忍痛出售。
    专营中出现的这些问题，应当引起各级领导的高度重视。去年全国农村工作会议之后，经过各级各方的艰苦努力，好不容易出现了农业升温的局面。专营部门应从利国利民出发，三思而行，正确使用“专营权”，切不可违背专营的宗旨，借着“专营”卡农民、坑农民。搞农业投入大，收益低，夺个丰收不容易。要想把农业搞上去，切实保护好农民种田的积极性是至关重要的。
