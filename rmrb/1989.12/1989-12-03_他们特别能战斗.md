**They Are Particularly Good at Fighting**

**I. Marching In**

On the evening of early June 1989, a series of urgent whistles broke the tranquility of the suburbs of Beijing. The martial law troops of a certain unit received the order to march in. When all the troops set out from their respective assembly points towards another region, a particularly arduous task was assigned to a certain company—responsible for the logistics adjustment of the troops, ensuring a smooth march in.

Political instructor Han Shizhang went ahead to execute the camp setup task. Company commander Li Zhengzhi dispatched a platoon leader with 14 soldiers familiar with the route to 7 different intersections. He then led the remaining soldiers to follow the troops. As he climbed into the driver's seat of a truck and slammed the door shut with a "bang," his heart was in turmoil. He did not know what awaited him. The last patch of cloud in the western sky had vanished, and the night had deepened. His mood grew more complex. As his truck maneuvered around groups of people blocking military vehicles, he felt uncertain. However, when the faces of the 14 soldiers flashed before his eyes, he regained his confidence, for he knew his soldiers.

When the troops arrived at a certain location in the suburbs of Beijing on May 20, they used the waiting time to study the spirit of the documents from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, combined with the situation and tasks conveyed by their superiors. They mobilized the cadres to conduct targeted education, and soon the entire company was bustling with activity. In less than a week, the results were significant. He and the political instructor were very satisfied. The 14 soldiers dispatched this time to execute the adjustment task were among those who had performed well during this study period.

However, he was still not entirely at ease, for they were after all soldiers. Facing the public and a few bad elements who did not understand the situation, it was difficult to guarantee that nothing would happen.

Around 10 PM, after arriving at the designated location, he met with the political instructor, exchanged a few words, and then hurried back along the original route to each intersection. He arrived at the first intersection and saw a dense crowd. He jumped out of the car, pushed through the crowd, and saw soldier Liu Zaimin answering the public's questions. His voice was already hoarse, his body soaked in sweat, and every word required great effort, but to avoid disappointing the public and to ensure the smooth march of the troops, this usually silent soldier still did his best to patiently answer the public's questions and inquiries with gestures. Although some of the public asked impatiently and even used disrespectful language, his responses were always gentle and composed, like a confident press spokesperson. Listen to a segment of his on-site dialogue with the public:

"Hey, why are you coming to Beijing?"

"We are carrying out the martial law mission as ordered."

"Martial law is just suppressing students!"

"No! If it were suppression, one regiment of troops would be enough."

"Why are you carrying guns?"

"Soldiers on a mission must carry guns. Guns, to soldiers, are like your tools for work or students' textbooks."

"Don't you support punishing corrupt officials and fighting corruption?"

"We fully support it. But relying on parades, hunger strikes, and unrealistic slogans will not solve the problem." ...

After a verbal sparring match, most of the crowd dispersed, and a few remaining skeptics lost their influence. The intersection gradually quieted down, but the two soldiers were exhausted and could barely stand. The company commander climbed back into the jeep and visited each intersection. When he saw his soldiers standing in the night, maintaining a strict military posture, awaiting the arrival of the main force, a sense of gratitude and affection welled up in his heart. This base-level commander, known for his strict discipline, silently exclaimed in his heart: What good soldiers! Thank you! A few hours later, under their guidance, the main force avoided the crowd, bypassed obstacles, and marched into the city, ensuring the troops arrived on time. Only after all the troops had safely passed did the soldiers executing the logistics tasks withdraw from each intersection.

On a certain day in June 1989, when military vehicles, troops, and tens of thousands of people were intertwined around Beijing, making it difficult to march into the city, this company was again tasked with quickly selecting routes for the main force. After some effort, they successfully completed the task. Around 8 PM, they first escorted the leaders and command headquarters to a building near Tiananmen Square in a certain unit's compound, according to the designated route. Commander Zhou Yushu was very satisfied with their work and praised them as a "fighting fist," which greatly encouraged them but also made them feel the weight of their responsibility. They knew that more severe tests awaited them.

**II. Comrades**

In the early hours of a certain day in June 1989, Beijing experienced a rare moment of calm amidst the turmoil. The skyscrapers of the East gradually brightened, and the clouds in the sky drifted gently. The clock tower of the Telegraph Building, as always, announced the time to Beijing. Everything seemed to show no signs of trouble. Soldiers who had been awake for two days and nights could not resist the urge to sleep and lay down on a piece of open concrete, fully clothed. Soon, snores filled the air. The sentry, wearing a steel helmet and carrying a gun, patrolled back and forth, his alert eyes missing nothing. The sound of his boots striking the concrete floor was like a drumbeat. Suddenly, a sharp whistle broke the soldiers' dreams. Commander Qi Huajun puffed out his cheeks and blew the whistle, breaking the silence. In that instant, he hesitated for a second, wishing the soldiers could sleep a little longer, but only for a second, he mustered his strength and blew the whistle, for the situation had changed. The troops entering the city were surrounded and blocked, some soldiers were beaten and cursed, military vehicles were smashed and burned, and the situation was critical, especially for some scattered officers and soldiers who were unfamiliar with the area and urgently needed rescue. One minute later, a 16-man emergency squad was formed. Political instructor Han Shizhang was the leader. Commander Qi Huajun briefly instructed him on the possible problems and strategies, and the squad set out.

Political instructor Han Shizhang led the first group from the northeast gate of a certain unit onto Chang'an Street, weaving through the crowd, and at a crossroads, discovered over 30 besieged comrades. These comrades were surrounded by the crowd, unable to escape, and after a long march, were extremely fatigued. But they were still trying to explain something to the crowd with their hoarse voices. However, some of the public, who did not understand the situation, continued to block them, throwing soda bottles, bricks, and spitting at them. Some even used foul language. Han Shizhang and two soldiers, familiar with the route, led the comrades into a small alley, quickly shook off the pursuing crowd, and safely entered the destination through a certain unit.

Platoon leader Sun Shoumin led the third group out of the east gate of a certain unit and found a group of people surrounding three soldiers, questioning and insulting them. Someone shouted hysterically, "Beat them to death!"

These were three young, clean-faced soldiers with barely visible down on their upper lips. Their childlike faces were covered in wounds and blood. Facing the chaotic crowd, they were confused, wronged, and heartbroken. Their hoarse voices could not utter a word, and they could only endure the spittle, bricks, and fists raining down on them. They were too exhausted to resist. Sun Shoumin's eyes reddened at the sight. He swallowed hard, wiped away the tears that welled up, and pulled over two of his soldiers, pushing through to the three soldiers. The three comrades, though not recognizing Sun Shoumin and the two soldiers, lit up when they saw their rescuers. Sun Shoumin had no time to signal them, and with the two soldiers he led, each grabbed a comrade and pulled them out of the crowd, turning a few corners to a secluded place. Sun Shoumin told them their unit's code name, and the three soldiers burst into tears. Sun Shoumin quickly helped them open their travel bags, changing their soiled clothes, and ordered a soldier to escort them to a certain unit. He then led another soldier in the opposite direction...

After several days of tense rescue operations, the emergency squad was extremely exhausted. At noon, they only ate a piece of bread and drank a bottle of soda, their stomachs growling with hunger, and their limbs weakening. They longed for a good sleep and a decent meal, but at this moment, even these basic needs seemed like a luxury, for they had just received a report that more scattered comrades were stranded at the Luomi Warehouse Retirement Home of the Beijing Military Region, needing immediate rescue. The Luomi Warehouse Retirement Home was about ten miles away, and they were unfamiliar with the situation and routes there. Everyone knew the task was arduous. Platoon leader Guo Lianhai volunteered to go. The political instructor thought for a moment and approved his request. Guo Lianhai selected six soldiers and set out. It was already past 9 PM. They took back roads, repeatedly shaking off the tails, and finally made contact with the besieged comrades. With the help of the comrades and the public at the retirement home, Guo Lianhai and his team made meticulous arrangements and then moved them in groups of three. On their way back, they walked through streets and alleys, taking detours, covering over 20 miles. By the next morning at around 6 AM, 44 comrades were safely escorted to the assembly point. However, Guo Lianhai and his six soldiers, exhausted and hungry, collapsed as soon as they entered the gate.

**III. Clearing the Square**

On the early morning of a certain day in June, the martial law troops of a certain unit received the order: the main force would set out from a certain unit, enter Tiananmen Square on time, and clear the square. But just before the troops set out, they heard another report: "The command center of the 'High Autonomous Federation' might be located inside the Museum of Chinese History and Revolution." At this time, some members of the "High Autonomous Federation" had already obtained some seized guns and ammunition. The loudspeakers on the square frequently spread rumors from here to the monument's podium. At the same time, some people of unknown origin also hid in the museum, acting as assistants for the "High Autonomous Federation" and the "Workers' Autonomous Federation." This was a very dangerous hidden threat. It must be eliminated before the main force advances.

At 1:30 AM, the entire company successfully passed through the northwest gate of a certain unit. Company commander Li Zhengzhi, political instructor Han Shizhang, platoon leader Sun Shoumin, and volunteer soldier Zhang Baoping led four teams, quickly entering the Museum of Chinese History and Revolution from the north gate. The Museum of Chinese History and Revolution—5,000 years of human culture condensed and solidified here. Walking through this solemn and elegant historical hall, the soldiers seemed to have walked back into yesterday, into history. Today, the storms and rains in this ancient civilized city added a new page to human history, and history will remember all this.

The museum's grand hall was dark, vast, and silent, and the exhibits were indistinguishable. The soldiers, holding submachine guns, groped their way forward. Turning a corner, they finally discovered some people. These people of unknown identity, seeing the soldiers descending from the sky, hurriedly rolled up their bedding and fled in panic. From the basement to the roof, a total of six floors, the soldiers did not miss a single gap, and only when they were sure there was no one left did they return to the main gate to gather. Meanwhile, those people of unknown identity probably saw the situation was not good and had already slipped away. Five minutes later, Commander Qi Huajun led part of the personnel to form an obstacle-clearing team, escorting the leaders to the designated command position. Soon, the square echoed with the sound of vehicle engines, and the main force, under the deployment of the martial law command, rumbled into the square. The curtain for the suppression and clearing of Tiananmen Square on the morning of June 4 was thus opened.

At 5:30 AM, the students and the public on the square had basically withdrawn, and the troops entered the square. However, in the southwest corner of the Museum of Chinese History and Revolution, over 100 Red Cross rescue personnel were still gathered. They, with their revolutionary humanitarianism of saving lives, had rescued a large number of students and the public during the student hunger strike and turmoil. They worked day and night on the square and in hospitals, calling on students and the public to stop hunger strikes and parades with their kindness and sincerity. However, the students and the public had withdrawn, and most members of the "High Autonomous Federation" and the "Workers' Autonomous Federation" had also slipped away unnoticed, leaving only them guarding the rescue equipment and medicines, waiting patiently and naively. When they discovered that what they were waiting for was not the public and students but soldiers with submachine guns, they were both surprised and delighted. At this time, Company Commander Li Zhengzhi stepped forward, saluted them with a standard military salute, and said, "The square is now being cleared, and we are here to escort you out of the square. Please follow us." The Red Cross rescue personnel followed the soldiers and withdrew to the south. The soldiers surrounded the rescue personnel, searching as they walked. When the team reached the vicinity of Dongjiaomin Lane, "rat-tat-tat," "rat-tat-tat," continuous bursts of submachine gun fire came from a high-rise building at the mouth of the lane, adding a few more touches of terror to the sky that had just calmed down. Although the few bursts did not cause any casualties, they disrupted the order of the team. The Red Cross rescue personnel, familiar only with the moans of the wounded and the firecrackers of festivals, were unfamiliar with real gunfire and were completely unprepared. The doctors were suddenly at a loss, panicking. The company commander and soldiers quickly organized them to take cover, using on-site cover to block the bullets that might come at any moment. Commander Qi Huajun led a vanguard squad, sticking close to the wall, quickly occupying another building on the west side of the high-rise building, using the terrain advantage to monitor and control the enemy's firepower point...

At this time, the Red Cross rescue personnel, under the cover of the soldiers, continued to withdraw southward. When the main force had all entered Tiananmen Square, and the golden sun shone its light upon the earth, all the Red Cross rescue personnel had been safely escorted to the designated location.

**IV. Alleviating Worries**

People must not have forgotten the long line of military vehicles burned at Muxidi to Gongzhufen on the morning of June 4; people must not have forgotten the military vehicles blocked and burned at Jiumen Bridge; people must not have forgotten the flames burning in the streets and suburbs of Beijing and the groans of the military vehicles.

On the night of June 3, as some troops entered the city, a few green trolleybuses were again blocking the bridge at Muxidi. On the morning of June 4, the armored vehicles and car convoy coming from the west were also blocked one after another. The trolleybuses blocked the bridgehead, clogging the road, and could not be moved. The convoy was forced to stop. The public quickly gathered around. To avoid conflict, the officers and soldiers abandoned the vehicles and retreated. A few looters, arsonists, and thieves then set fire to over a hundred armored vehicles, trucks, jeeps, and other vehicles. Guns and ammunition, as well as other military supplies, were scattered everywhere, and some were thrown into the river. The weapons and ammunition that fell into the hands of the public and a few bad elements were gradually confiscated after the suppression of the turmoil, but some of those thrown into the river had to be dredged up by people. People deeply understood that if these weapons and ammunition were retrieved by bad elements, they would leave endless troubles. They decided to organize forces to dredge them up for the long-term stability of the capital, leaving no hidden dangers.

On the afternoon of July 13, the company commander and political instructor led the entire company to Muxidi Bridge. The company commander first led two soldiers with good swimming skills into the river to test the water. Then, the soldiers took off their outer clothes and shoes and waded into the river. The surface of the river was calm and clear, but underneath was complex, with varying depths and all kinds of debris and garbage, such as broken glass shards, lead wire, iron sheets, bricks, stones, animal carcasses, and more. Soldier Liu Zhanjie's sole was cut open, and he had to return to the shore. The river water was dyed red with his blood. The soldiers continued to search barefoot... However, after more than three hours, except for a few car parts, they found nothing else.

From July 26 to 29, the company, led by the company commander and political instructor, returned to Muxidi Bridge. This time, they expanded the dredging area to 300 meters north of the bridge and 600 meters south of the bridge, dividing the area into sections for dredging. After four days of hard work, they retrieved two submachine guns, two heavy machine guns, and a large number of bullets, tear gas grenades, videotapes, film rolls, leaflets, and more from the Muxidi River. When the soldiers showed these witnesses of the turmoil to the onlookers, the crowd sighed and lamented. Those who had spoken casually also lowered their heads in shame and looked at the soldiers in the river with respect. Some of the public even brought them bread and soda.

Jiumen Bridge is a beautiful bridge. It is located at the intersection of the Third Ring Road and Xitoucheng, with lush green parks and ancient seas on both sides. However, the river beneath the bridge is dirty, or more accurately, a sewage ditch. Industrial and domestic sewage flows through it day and night. According to public reports, weapons were thrown into this river during the turmoil.

On August 19, the company, led by the battalion commander, came to the bridge. Facing the sewage ditch before them, the soldiers hesitated for a moment; the yellow water, covered with foam, flowed slowly, and floating feces and garbage rolled in the water. A pungent odor filled the air. However, after a brief hesitation, the soldiers descended the steps into the water. The riverbed was filled with nearly a foot of stinking mud and garbage, which, when stirred, floated to the surface, emitting a foul odor that made the soldiers nauseous and tearful. The settled feces, toilet paper, dead chickens, dead ducks, and rotten plastic bags also floated in the water, making it disgusting.

Seeing the soldiers dredging in the river, some curious citizens gathered on both sides to watch. Among them, a fashionable couple on a motorcycle commented: "These soldiers are bored, messing around in this stinking ditch for no reason." When they learned that the soldiers were dredging weapons and ammunition lost during the turmoil, they said: "They must have been paid a lot to do this; otherwise, who would do such a foolish thing?" The couple, each holding a can of Coca-Cola, leaned on each other, drinking and chatting leisurely. Platoon leader Sun Shoumin overheard their conversation clearly. He looked up at them, feeling amused but not wanting to explain. He thought, if it were for money, I would have quit the army long ago. Now, no matter what I do, I earn more than being a soldier, but this affectionate couple made him sentimental. He also had a gentle and beautiful fiancée, and they loved each other deeply. They were not young, and they had planned to get married at the beginning of the year, but since the army was in full training, they decided to wait until May Day to have a proper wedding. When everything was ready, even the invitations were sent out, the army received the order: standby for emergency. Soon, Sun Shoumin entered Beijing with the army to enforce martial law. The lover missed the lover, and the gentle fiancée, knowing that Sun Shoumin's whereabouts were unknown, still wrote him six letters that could not be sent, her hot feelings unable to be conveyed to her beloved. Her hanging heart was even more unsettled, although she still had a thousand words to pour out, she stopped writing. She decided to go to Beijing to find him. Especially when she learned of some soldiers executing martial law being beaten and burned, she could not stay still.

The fate of her future son-in-law was unknown, how could she let her daughter take the risk, her parents used all their might to persuade her daughter to stay. In late June, she had someone bring the six letters to Sun Shoumin. Sun Shoumin was so excited that he could not sleep all night. This made his love for her even stronger. At this moment, he longed for her to come to Beijing, but he was executing the martial law mission, and the situation in Beijing still needed the martial law troops to work hard. He could only spread out the paper, pick up the pen, and write her a long letter. In this letter full of love, all the hot words were used up, but he did not mention letting her come to Beijing... Suddenly, soldier Zhang Jun held up a submachine gun and excitedly shouted to him, "Platoon leader, I found it!" Everyone looked at him with wide eyes...

    他们特别能战斗
    阿勇　李树成　李怀
    一、开进
    1989年6月初的一天傍晚，一阵阵急促的哨声打破了京郊黄昏的宁静，戒严部队某部接到了开进的命令。当所有的部队由各集结地出发开向另一地区时，一个十分艰巨的任务交给了某连——负责部队的勤务调整，保证顺利开进。
    指导员韩仕祥打前站执行设营任务。连长李正芝派了一名排长带领14名熟悉路线的战士分赴7个路口，他则率领剩下的战士跟随部队开进。当他钻进汽车驾驶室“乒”地一声带上车门的时候，心里却是七上八下的。他不知等待自己的是什么情况。西边天际的最后一片云已经消匿，夜的成色又浓了几分，他的心情也更加复杂。当他乘坐的汽车绕过一群群堵截军车的群众时，他感到心里没底。但是当他的眼睛里闪过那14名战士的面孔后，他又充满了信心，因为他了解自己的战士。
    当5月20日部队奉命来到京郊某地时，他们利用待命的时间，用党中央、国务院和中央军委的文件精神，结合上级传达的形势和任务，发动骨干，有针对性地搞好教育，一时间，全连上下热闹非凡，不到一周，收效甚大。他和指导员很满意。这次派出执行调整任务的14名战士，都是这次学习中表现比较好的。
    然而，他还是不太放心，因为他们毕竟是战士，面对不明真相的群众和极少数坏人，很难保证不发生什么事。
    晚上10点左右，他到达指定地点后，和指导员碰了头，简单地交换了一下情况，又乘车匆匆赶回原路，奔向每一个路口。他来到了第一个路口，看到了黑压压的人群。他跳下车，拨开人群，看到战士刘再民正在回答群众的问题，他的嗓子虽然已经沙哑，全身被汗水浸湿，每说一句话都要使出很大力气，但为了不使群众失望，为了部队能顺利开进，这个平时沉默寡言的战士还是千方百计地借助手势耐心解答群众的提问和质问。虽然有些群众问得急躁，甚至有许多不恭之词，但他的回答总是和蔼可亲、从容不迫的，如同一个胸有成竹的新闻发言人。请听一段他和群众的现场对话：
    “哎，你说你们为什么进京？”
    “我们奉命执行戒严任务。”
    “戒严还不就是镇压学生！”
    “不对！如果是镇压，一个团的兵力足够了。”
    “你们为什么带枪？”
    “军人执行任务怎能不带枪。枪，对于军人来说，就像你们工人上班的工具、学生上学的课本一样。”
    “难道你们不赞成惩治官倒，反对腐败？”
    “我们举双手赞成。但靠游行、绝食、喊一些不切合实际的口号是解决不了问题的。”……
    一阵唇枪舌剑，绝大部分人退去，极少数人虽然将信将疑，但也失去了号召力。路口渐渐安静下来，但两名战士却累得有些支持不住了。
    连长又登上吉普车，沿着每个路口走了一遍，当他看到自己的战士均以严整的军姿屹立在夜色里等待大部队的身影时，一股感激和痛爱之情油然而起。这个平时以严格要求闻名部队的基层指挥员在心里默默地喊着：多好的战士啊！谢谢你们！几个小时后，大部队在他们的指引下避开人群，绕过障碍，向城里开进，保证了部队按时到达。当所有部队安全通过之后，执行勤务的战士们才撤离每一个路口。
    1989年6月某日，当北京四周的军车、部队和成千上万的群众交织在一起，艰难地往城里开进时，该连又接受了为大部队迅速开进选择路线的任务。他们经过一番努力，顺利地完成了任务。下午8时许，他们首先按照指定的路线，把首长和指挥机关护送到靠近天安门的某单位大院的一栋楼旁，部队长周玉书对他们的工作感到十分满意，称他们是一只“能战斗的拳头”，这使他们深受鼓舞，又觉得担子更重了。他们知道，等待他们的是更严峻的考验。
    二、战友
    1989年6月某日凌晨的北京，出现了动乱以来少有的暂时宁静，高楼林立的东方渐渐发白，悬挂在天际的云彩在轻轻飘动，电报大楼的钟声一如既往地把北京时间告诉人们。这一切似乎看不出有什么不祥之兆。两天两夜没合眼的战士们抵御不住瞌睡的侵袭，在一块露天水泥地上和衣而睡，一会儿，便响起此起彼伏的鼾声。头戴钢盔的哨兵挎枪来回走动，警觉的眼睛不放过蛛丝马迹，翻毛皮鞋叩击水泥地板的响声如同更鼓。突然，一阵刺耳的哨声响起，营长齐华军鼓起两腮用哨声打破了士兵们的梦。他把哨子衔在嘴上的那一瞬间，曾经犹豫了一秒钟，他是多么希望战士们多睡一会儿，但仅仅是一瞬间，他还是运足了底气吹响了哨声，因为形势已经突变，进城部队被围追堵截，有的战士被打骂，军车被砸、烧，情况十分危急，特别是一些掉队和散落的干部战士，他们人地生疏，急需去营救。一分钟之后，一支16名战士组成的应急小分队组成了。指导员韩仕祥任队长。营长齐华军简单向他交待了可能遇到的问题和对策，小分队便出发了。
    指导员韩仕祥率领第一小组从某单位东北门进入长安街，穿过喧嚣的人群，在一个十字路口发现了30多名被围困的战友。这些战友被人群团团包围，欲拔不能，经过长途行军已经极度疲劳，但他们依然在用沙哑的嗓子向群众努力解释着什么，然而一些不明真相的群众仍然死死地堵住他们，有些人向他们投掷汽水瓶、石砖、吐口水，还有些人用不堪入耳的语言谩骂着。韩仕祥和两名战士凭借对路线的熟悉，带着战友们拐进一条小胡同，果断甩掉跟随的人群，从某单位穿插，顺利进入了目的地。
    二排长孙守民带领的第三小组从某单位的东门出来后，发现一群人正围着三名战士，质问、辱骂一起泼向他们，有人歇斯底里地高喊：“打死他们！”
    这是3个满脸稚气眉清目秀的战士，嘴角刚刚拱出细细的绒毛，充满孩子气的脸上满是伤痕和血迹，面对失态的人群，他们不解、委屈、伤心，嘶哑的嗓子已经说不出半句话来，任凭唾沫、砖块、拳脚雨点般地落在他们的脸上、身上，他们已经疲惫得毫无抵御能力。孙守民一看见这情景眼圈就红了，他咽了一口唾沫，用袖子擦去溢出的泪，拉过本组两个战士就挤到3名战士身边。3个战友虽然不认识孙守民和两名战士，当看到前来营救自己的战友，眼睛顿时亮了起来。孙守民已经来不及暗示他们什么，便和两名自己带领的战士一个拉住一名战友，将他们带出人群，拐了几道弯来到一个僻静处，孙守民告诉了他们自己部队代号，3个战士一听眼泪就刷刷地下来了。孙守民迅速帮他们打开旅行包，为3名战士换了身上被弄脏了的衣服，命令一名战士将他们护送到某单位，自己带另一名战士向相反的方向走去……
    经过几天紧张的奔波和营救，应急小分队已经极度劳累。中午，他们只吃了一块面包，喝了一瓶汽水，肚子已经饿得发慌，四肢发软，他们是多么希望好好睡一觉，好好吃一顿像样的饭，可是，此时此刻，这起码的要求却如同奢望，因为，刚刚接到报告，又有不少名失散的战友被困在北京军区后勤部禄米仓干休所，需要马上派人接应营救。禄米仓干休所距这里有十几华里，而且对那里的情况、线路都不熟，情况这么复杂，大家都知道任务艰巨。一排长郭连海主动要求前往。指导员想了想，批准了他的要求。郭连海挑选了6名战士踏上了征程。这时已经是晚上9点多了。他们专门走小路，一次次地甩掉盯梢，终于和被围的战友接上头。在干休所同志和群众的帮助下，郭连海等为他们作了周密的安排，然后，3人一组，分批转移。在回来的路上，他们穿街走巷，绕道迂回，步行了20多公里。在第二天早晨6时左右，44名战友终于安全地被护送到了集结地。而郭连海和他的6名战士却因累饿交加，一进大门就躺倒在地上。
    三、清场
    6月某日凌晨，戒严部队某部接到命令，大部队要从某单位出发，准时进入天安门广场实施清场。但就在部队出发之前，又听到一个情况：“高自联”的指挥部可能设在历史博物馆内。这时，“高自联”的部分人已掌握了一些抢来的枪支弹药。广场大喇叭里的谣言也频频从这里制造出来，送往纪念碑下的播音台。同时，还有一些来路不明的人也栖息在博物馆内，为“高自联”、“工自联”充当帮手。这是一个十分危险的隐患。必须在大部队开进之前清除掉。
    1时30分，全连顺利通过某单位西北门，连长李正芝、指导员韩仕祥、二排长孙守民和志愿兵张宝平分别带领4个小组，迅速由北门潜入历史博物馆内。历史博物馆——人类5000年的文化浓缩在这里，凝固在这里。穿行在这座庄严高雅的历史殿堂里，指战员们仿佛又走进昨天、走进历史。今天，发生在这个古老的文明都市的风风雨雨，又为人类的历史增添了新的一页，历史会记住这一切的。
    博物馆大厅里没有灯光，空旷寂静，展品黑乎乎的难以辨认，战士们端着冲锋枪摸索着前行。拐过一个弯，终于发现了一些人，这些身份不明的闲杂人员见到如从天降的士兵，纷纷卷起铺盖卷仓皇而走。从地下室到楼顶一共6层，战士们不放过一个空隙，确信不再有人时才返回大门集中，而那帮不明身份的人大概见势不妙，早已溜了。5分钟后，营长齐华军带领部分人员组成的排障队，护送首长到达预定指挥位置。随后，广场陆续响起车辆的引擎声，大部队在戒严指挥部的部署下，隆隆开进了广场。6月4日凌晨天安门广场平暴清场由此拉开了序幕。
    凌晨5时30分，广场上的学生和群众已基本撤完，部队进入广场。但在历史博物馆西南角的台阶下，还聚集着100余名红十字会的救护人员。他们凭借着救死扶伤的革命人道主义，在学生绝食和动乱期间，救护过大批学生和群众。他们不分昼夜地奔忙在广场和医院，以他们的善良和诚意呼唤和感召学生和群众停止绝食和游行。但是，学生和群众撤走了，“高自联”和“工自联”的大部分成员也神不知鬼不觉地溜了，只剩下他们守着救护器材和药品天真而耐心地等待着。等他们发现等来的不是群众和学生，而是端着冲锋枪的解放军时，又惊又喜。这时，连长李正芝走上前去，向他们行了一个标准的军礼，对他们说：“现在广场上正在清场，我们是来护送你们出广场的，请跟我们走。”这些红十字会的救护人员纷纷跟着战士们向南撤去。战士们把救护人员围在中间，边走边搜索。当队伍行至东交民巷附近时，“哒哒哒”、“哒哒哒”，连续几个冲锋枪的点射从巷口的一座高层楼房上传来，使刚刚宁静的天空又增加了几分恐怖。几个点射虽然没有造成伤亡，但却乱了队伍的阵脚，红十字会的救护人员只熟悉伤员的呻吟和节日的鞭炮声，而对真正的枪声却很陌生，毫无思想准备的大夫们顿时不知所措，乱成一团。连长和战士们一边要求大家不要慌，一边迅速组织他们隐蔽，利用现场的遮蔽物抵挡随时可能射过来的子弹。营长齐华军带领一个尖兵小组，贴着墙跟，很快抢占了高层楼房西侧的另一座楼，利用地形优势对高层楼房实行监视，控制对方的火力点……
    这时，红十字会救护人员在战士们的掩护下，继续南撤。当大部队全部进入天安门广场，当金色的太阳把她的光辉又铺向大地，全体红十字救护人员已被全部安全地送到指定地点。
    四、排忧
    人们一定还没忘记6月4日早晨木樨地到公主坟那长龙般被烧的军车车队吧；人们也一定没忘记蓟门桥上被堵截焚烧的军车吧；人们也一定没忘记北京城里和城郊那一片片燃烧的火焰和军车的呻吟。
    6月3日深夜，部分部队进入城区之时，几辆草绿色的无轨电车又堵在了木樨地的桥上。6月4日凌晨，从西向东开过来的装甲车和汽车队也相继被堵住。无轨电车的身躯死死地卡住桥头，塞住路面，无法挪动。车队被迫停下，群众迅速拥过来。为了避免冲突，部队干部战士弃车撤退之后，少数打、砸、抢、烧分子，相继点燃百余辆装甲车、卡车、吉普车及其它车辆，枪支弹药以及其余的军用物资，有的被扔得遍地都是，还有的被扔进河里，装甲车顶部的机枪也有的被拆卸拿走或扔进河中。散落在群众和少数坏人手中的武器弹药，在平息暴乱取得决定性胜利后有的被陆续收缴上来，而部分被扔进河里的就要靠人去打捞了。人们深深明白，这些丢入河中的武器弹药一旦被坏人捞走，将后患无穷。他们为了首都长治久安，不留隐患，迅速决定组织力量打捞。这打捞枪支弹药的重点任务又被这个连抢了过来。
    7月13日下午，连长和指导员带着全连来到了木樨地桥上，连长首先带着两名水性好的战士下河试水，接着战士们纷纷脱掉外衣和鞋子趟向河中，河水的表面是平静的、清澈的，但水下是复杂的，不但深浅不一，而且还沉落着各种各样的杂物和垃圾，有碎玻璃碴、铅丝、铁皮、砖瓦石块、动物尸体等等。战士刘占刚脚心被划了一个大口子，不得不返回岸上，殷红的血把河水染红了一大片。战士们仍继续赤脚搜……但是，3个多小时过去之后，除了捞上来几个汽车零件之外，别的一无所获。
    7月26至29日，该连在连长、指导员的带领下，又来到木樨地桥。这一次，他们把打捞的范围扩大到桥北300米，桥南600米，分区划片，进行打捞，经过4天的奋战，在木樨地河中共捞起冲锋枪2支，高射机枪2挺，以及大量的子弹、催泪瓦斯弹、录相带、胶卷、传单等，当战士们把这些暴乱的见证展示给围观的群众时，人群里一阵唏嘘和喟叹。那些说风凉话的人也惭愧地低下了头。继而向河中的战士投去敬佩的目光。有些群众还给他们送来面包和汽水。
    蓟门桥是一个美丽的桥。它坐落在三环路与西土城的交叉点上，桥两边是绿柳成荫的公园和古海，然而，桥下的河却是肮脏的，准确地说是一条污水沟。整日哗哗流淌着工业污水和生活污水。根据群众举报，暴乱时有人向这条河里扔过武器。
    8月19日，该连在营长的带领下来到桥下，面对眼前的污水沟，战士们有点犹豫了；泛着泡沫的黄色的水缓缓流着，漂浮的粪便和垃圾在水中翻卷着，一阵阵令人难耐的恶臭扑鼻而来。但是，仅仅是短暂的犹豫之后，战士们便沿着台阶进入水中。河底淤积着近一尺厚的臭泥和垃圾，经搅和之后翻滚上来，恶臭的气味呛得战士们翻胃、流泪，沉淀的粪便、卫生纸、死鸡、死鸭、烂塑料袋也在水中漂浮，令人恶心。
    看到战士们在河中打捞，一些好奇的市民又聚集在两边观看，其中有一对骑摩托来的穿着时髦的恋人模样的青年男女边看边议论：这帮当兵的是吃饱撑的，没事干在这臭水沟里折腾啥？当他们得知战士们是在打捞暴乱期间丢失的武器弹药时，又说：一定是给了不少钱他们才肯下水的，否则，谁干这傻事？这对男女每人攥着一个可口可乐易拉罐勾肩搭背边喝边说悠然自得。正在水中用脚边踩边走的排长孙守民对他们的对话听得真切，他抬头看看他们，心里觉得好笑，但又不愿向他们解释。他心想，要是为了钱我早就不当兵了，现在无论干什么，也比当兵挣的多，但这对亲昵的男女却使他触景生情。他也有一个温柔美丽的未婚妻，他很爱她，她也很爱他，相亲相爱，如胶似漆，两人年龄都不小了，本来准备年初结婚的，但由于部队正进入全训阶段，两人商定等到“五一”好好地办一下，就在方方面面准备就绪连请柬都发出去的时候，部队接到命令：紧急待命。不久孙守民随部队进京戒严。情人思念情人，温柔的未婚妻明知小孙地址不详，却连续给他写过6封发不出去的信，炽热的情感无法寄给心爱的人，悬着的那颗爱心也更放不下来，尽管心中仍有千言万语要倾诉，她还是止住了笔，她决意要进京找他。特别是当她得知一些执行戒严任务的军人被打、被烧的情景后，她更是呆不住了。
    未来的女婿吉凶未卜，怎能再让女儿冒风险，她的父母使出浑身解数劝住了女儿。6月下旬，她托人把那6封信捎给小孙，小孙激动得彻夜难眠。这使他对她的爱更加强烈了。此刻，他是多么希望她能来北京呵，然而，他正在执行戒严任务，北京的形势还需要戒严部队去努力工作。他只能铺开稿纸，提笔给她写了一封长长的回信，在这封充满恩爱的信中，所有炽热如火的词都用尽了，唯独没有提及让她来京之事……忽然战士张军举着一支冲锋枪兴奋地向他大声喊道：“排长，我捞着了！”所有的人都向他瞪大了眼睛……
