In recent years, drug abuse and trafficking have become increasingly rampant on a global scale. Some even say that the Earth is being "poisoned."

From the three reports in this issue, it can be seen that the fight against drugs has become a major concern in 1989. In Western countries, unemployment, poverty, despair, and the decline of social morals have led to a social demand for drugs. The pursuit of money and the desire for quick riches have fueled drug smuggling activities, resulting in a proliferation of drugs. This, in turn, stimulates the demand for drugs, making drug abuse and trafficking a persistent social problem that is difficult to eradicate.

Drugs have become an international menace that threatens human health and social stability. Strengthening international cooperation is essential to achieve effective results in the fight against drugs.

    编者的话
    近年来，全球范围的吸毒、贩毒活动日益猖獗。有人甚至说，地球正在被“毒化”。
    从本版的三篇报道可以看出，反毒斗争已成了一九八九年全球关注的一件大事。在西方国家，因失业、贫困、苦闷、绝望以及社会道德水准下降，造成了毒品的社会需求；追求金钱、贪发横财的风气助长着毒品走私活动，结果形成毒品泛滥，而这又刺激了对毒品的需求，使吸毒、贩毒成了一个难以根治的社会顽症。
    毒品已成为危害人类健康和社会安宁的国际公害，必须加强国际合作，才能取得扫毒的成效。
