Since the founding of New China, twenty-three giant pandas have served as "friendly ambassadors," successively arriving in the Soviet Union, North Korea, Britain, Japan, France, the United States, Mexico, Spain, and West Germany. They have settled in foreign lands and been warmly welcomed.

As a unique product of China, whether giant pandas can reproduce in foreign countries has always been a matter of great concern to zoologists and the general public. In August 1980, Yingying at the Chapultepec National Zoo in Mexico City made history by giving birth to a cub. However, as a first-time mother, Yingying lacked experience and accidentally crushed the little one to death. The following year, Yingying gave birth again, and this cub, named Cancun, became the first giant panda born and raised outside of China. Later, Yingying and Beibei, her loving mate, had three more pregnancies, resulting in five cubs, four of which survived. This made Mexico the country with the second-largest population of giant pandas outside of China. Unfortunately, in July 1988, Beibei passed away suddenly due to a rapidly expanding tumor under his arm, leaving behind his beloved wife and four children.

In 1982, the female panda Xiaoxia at the Madrid Zoo gave birth to Zhulin through artificial insemination. The sperm was provided by Chicheng, a male giant panda from the London Zoo. This was a successful international cooperation.

The Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, Japan, also achieved success in breeding giant pandas. The female panda Huanhuan, after losing her first cub in 1985, gave birth to Tongtong in 1986 and Youyou in 1988. These two joyous events caused a national celebration in Japan, filled with excitement and joy.

In contrast, Lingling in Washington had less luck. Lingling gave birth four times in 1983, 1984, 1987, and September of this year, but unfortunately, none of the cubs survived. After Lingling's first cub died just three hours after birth in 1983, the World Wildlife Fund in Switzerland even lowered its flag to half-mast in mourning. It is said that this was an unprecedented act of mourning for an animal.

    大熊猫在国外
    陈远飞
    新中国成立以来，有二十三头大熊猫作为“友好使者”，先后到达苏联、朝鲜、英国、日本、法国、美国、墨西哥、西班牙和联邦德国。它们在异国安家落户，倍受欢迎。
    作为中国的特产，大熊猫在异乡它国能否生儿育女，一直是动物学家和广大观众关心的大事。一九八零年八月，墨西哥城查普尔特佩克国家动物园的迎迎首开记录，产下一头幼仔。但是初次做母亲的迎迎缺乏经验，不慎将小宝贝压死。次年迎迎再度产仔，这头取名坎昆的动物就成为世界上第一头在中国以外出生并成活的大熊猫。此后，迎迎和贝贝恩恩爱爱，又三次怀孕，五胎产下四仔，使墨西哥一举成为除中国外世界上拥有大熊猫最多的国家。不幸的是一九八八年七月，贝贝因腋下肿块迅速扩展，抢救无效，撇下爱妻和四个子女溘然长逝。
    西班牙马德里动物园的雌兽绍绍，一九八二年经人工授精技术生下竹琳。精液采自英国伦敦动物园的雄性大熊猫佳佳，这是一次成功的国际合作。
    日本东京上野动物园在大熊猫的繁衍后代上也取得成功，雌性大熊猫欢欢于一九八五年失去头胎幼仔后，在一九八六年生下童童；一九八八年产下悠悠。这二大喜事使日本举国欢腾，热闹非凡。
    相比之下，华盛顿的玲玲就运气欠佳。玲玲于一九八三年、一九八四年、一九八七年和今年九月四次得胎分娩，可惜幼仔均未能成活。玲玲一九八三年头胎幼仔出生三个小时就夭折后，世界野生生物基金会在瑞士的总部还特地下半旗致哀。为哀悼动物而下半旗，据说是史无前例的。
