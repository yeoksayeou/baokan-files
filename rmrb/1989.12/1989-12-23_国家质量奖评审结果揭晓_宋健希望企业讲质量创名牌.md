The National Quality Award Review Committee today announced the results of the 1989 National Quality Award in Beijing. Song Jian, a member of the State Council and the chairman of the National Quality Award Review Committee, presided over the meeting. He expressed his hope that all enterprises across the country will prioritize quality, strive for excellence, and create renowned products.

This year's awards include the National Quality Management Award, National Excellent Product Award, Chinese Craftsmanship Hundred Flowers Award, and National Excellent Project Award. Among them, 23 enterprises received the National Quality Management Award, 6 enterprises that had previously won the award and completed their 5-year validity period were re-evaluated and awarded, and 6 enterprises were granted preliminary evaluation qualifications. The National Excellent Product Award was awarded to 329 products, with gold and silver medals respectively. The Chinese Craftsmanship Hundred Flowers Award was given to 22 items, including gold and silver cups. This year, the National Excellent Project Award did not have a first-class winner, but there were 26 silver awards, with 118 construction, design, and construction units receiving awards.

In accordance with the opinions of relevant leaders of the State Council on improving the evaluation methods, this year's National Quality Award mainly relied on industry and expert evaluations, strictly controlling the standards. Overall, the winning enterprises and projects this year are of a high level. For example, the carbon dioxide centrifugal compressor from Shenyang Blower Works, the three series of industrial steam turbines from Hangzhou Steam Turbine Works, and the 3KVA uninterruptible power supply from Nanjing Radio Factory are all world-class excellent products.

This year's National Excellent Product Award evaluation, in accordance with the national industrial policy, gave appropriate "tilt" to energy, raw materials, import substitution, foreign exchange earning, and agricultural products. In the agricultural sector, in addition to agricultural films and agricultural machinery, the feed industry set up a gold medal for the first time. This gold medal was awarded to Beijing Nanyuan Feed Factory. Among the winning enterprises and products, those involved in import substitution and foreign exchange earning accounted for a significant proportion. Statistics show that these enterprises and products have an annual foreign exchange earning of nearly 600 million US dollars. Notably, the black-and-white display tubes produced by Sichuan Hongguang Electronic Tube Factory have an annual foreign exchange earning of over 30 million US dollars.

Song Jian commended the work of the evaluation committee members. He said that the evaluation work is an important measure to guide enterprises to strengthen quality management and strive to create domestic and international high-quality products. During the period of rectification and order, it is necessary to crack down on the production and sales of counterfeit and substandard products in both production enterprises and circulation sectors.

    国家质量奖评审结果揭晓
    宋健希望企业讲质量创名牌
    新华社北京12月21日电　（记者姜在忠）国家质量奖审定委员会今天在北京审定、发布了1989年度国家质量奖评审结果。国务委员、国家质量奖审定委员会主任宋健同志主持了今天的会议，他希望全国企业讲质量、抓质量，争创名牌产品。
    今年评出的国家质量奖包括国家质量管理奖、国家优质产品奖、中国工艺美术品百花奖和国家优质工程奖4项。其中国家质量管理奖获奖企业为23家，5年有效期满重评获奖企业6家，另有6家企业获得预评资格；国家优质产品奖金、银奖分别授予了329个产品；获中国工艺美术品百花奖金、银杯奖共计22项；今年的国家优质工程奖没有评出一等奖，计有26项银质奖，获奖的建设、设计、施工单位118个。
    遵照国务院有关领导同志关于改进评优方法的意见，今年的国家质量奖主要依靠行业和专家评审，从严把握，从总体水平上看，今年的获奖企业和项目是较高的。如沈阳鼓风机厂的二氧化碳离心压缩机、杭州汽轮机厂的三系列工业汽轮机和南京无线电厂的3KVA不间断电源等，堪称世界水平的优质产品。
    今年的国家优质奖评审，根据国家产业政策，对能源、原材料、替代进口、出口创汇和支农产品等给予了适度“倾斜”。支农方面，除农用薄膜、农用机械外，饲料工业首次设立了一块金牌。这块金牌被北京南苑配备饲料厂获得。在获奖的企业和产品中，替代进口、出口创汇的企业和产品占了很大比例。据统计，这些企业和产品的年创汇额近6亿美元。比较突出的四川红光电子管厂所生产的黑白显像管，年创汇达3000多万美元。
    宋健同志在讲话中对评委们的工作给予了积极评价。他说，评优工作是引导企业加强质量管理，争创国内国际优质产品的一项重要措施。在治理整顿期间，要在生产企业和流通领域狠狠打击伪劣产品的生产和经销。
