Taipei News: The voting for Taiwan's "three public official elections" was held yesterday. The results showed that out of 293 seats for "county and city mayors," "legislative commissioners," and "provincial and municipal councilors," KMT candidates won 205 seats, DPP candidates won 64 seats, and independent candidates won 24 seats.

This is the first election since Taiwan lifted martial law in 1987, with 722 candidates participating in the "three public official elections." According to reports, out of 20 million Taiwanese, 12 million are eligible voters, and approximately 70% of eligible voters participated in the voting.

The election results showed that in the 21 county and city mayor elections, KMT candidates won 14 seats, DPP candidates won 6 seats, and independent candidates won 1 seat. Compared to the previous term, the KMT lost 3 seats. The Taiwan United Daily reported that this is the most significant defeat the KMT has faced in county and city mayor elections in 38 years.

According to reports, 101 seats for "additional legislative commissioners" were up for election, with the KMT winning 72 seats, the DPP winning 21 seats, and independents winning 8 seats. Compared to the previous "additional legislative commissioner" election, the proportion of seats won by the KMT decreased by 9%, the proportion of seats won by the DPP increased by 6.4%, and the number of independent seats increased threefold.

A total of 77 seats for "provincial councilors" were up for election, with the KMT winning 54 seats, the DPP winning 15 seats, and independent candidates winning 8 seats. Taipei "city councilors" had 51 seats up for election, with the KMT winning 36 seats, the DPP winning 14 seats, and independents winning 1 seat. Kaohsiung "city councilors" had 43 seats up for election, with the KMT winning 29 seats, the DPP winning 8 seats, independents winning 5 seats, and the Labor Party winning 1 seat.

According to reports, during the election, there were conflicts in Tainan County, Nantou County, Hsinchu City, and Taoyuan County due to public dissatisfaction with the vote counting results. In Tainan, approximately 2,000 people gathered in front of the "county government" to protest alleged election manipulation. In Nantou, several hundred people rushed to the "county government" offices and were stopped by riot police. As of the time of writing, the confrontation between the crowd and the police in front of the Tainan County Government continues.

According to reports from Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers, the "three public official elections" in Taiwan have concluded. The "Taiwan independence" forces have rapidly expanded in this election, with many strong advocates of "Taiwan independence" entering the political arena, drawing attention and concern from various sectors in Taiwan.

According to reports, in this election, 32 candidates from the so-called "New Country Alliance," which strongly advocates for "Taiwan independence," had 8 people elected as "legislative commissioners" and 12 people elected as "provincial councilors," significantly increasing the number of "Taiwan independence" advocates in Taiwan's political arena.

Related reports pointed out that during the election, the "New Country Alliance" openly proposed the "Taiwan independence" demands of "new country, new constitution." The Taiwan authorities' attitude was ambiguous, basically adopting a "tolerant" stance, leading to a surge in "Taiwan independence" sentiments.

Taiwan officials believe that in the first major election after lifting martial law, overseas "Taiwan independence" elements have concentrated their activities on the island, creating a lot of hype for the "Taiwan independence" advocates running for office.

The election results indicate that "Taiwan independence" in Taiwan is no longer limited to rhetoric but has moved to action, not just advocating in society but has already directly entered Taiwan's power structure. It is expected that the struggle between "unification" and "independence" in Taiwan's political arena will become more open and confrontational. The expansion of "Taiwan independence" forces brings hidden concerns for the stability of Taiwan's political situation and the peaceful reunification of China.

    台湾“三项公职人员选举”揭晓
    国民党受挫“台独”势力膨胀
    新华社香港12月3日电　台北消息：台湾“三项公职人员选举”昨天举行投票，选票结果显示，在台湾293个“县市长”、“立法委员”、“省市议员”席位中，国民党候选人获得205席，民进党候选人获得64席，无党籍候选人获得24席。
    这是1987年台湾解除戒严以来进行的第一次选举，共有722个候选人参加了“三项公职人员选举”角逐。据报道，在2000万台湾人中，有1200万是合格选民，约有70％的合格选民参加了投票。
    投票选举结果显示，台湾21个县市长选举中，国民党候选人获得14席，民进党候选人获得6席，无党籍候选人获得1席。与上一届相比，国民党失去了3席。台湾《联合报》报道说，这是国民党38年来在县市长的选举中所遭到的最重大的一次挫败。
    据报道，“增额立法委员”应选出101席，国民党获72席，民进党获21席，无党籍获8席。与上次“增额立委”选举相比，国民党所获席次占应选席次的比例下降9％，民进党所获席次占应选席次的比例上升6.4％，而无党籍却增加了3倍。
    台湾“省议员”共应选出77席，国民党获54席，民进党获15席，无党籍候选人获8席。台北“市议员”应选出51席，国民党获36席，民进党获14席，无党籍获1席。高雄“市议员”应选43席，国民党获29席，民进党获8席，无党籍获5席，工党获1席。
    据报道，在选举时，台南县、南投县、新竹市、桃园县都因有民众不满开票结果而发生冲突。台南约有2000人聚集在“县府”门前，抗议有人操纵选举的行径，南投约有数百人涌到“县府”机关，遭到防暴警察的阻止。截至发稿时，台南县府门前的民众与警察仍在对峙之中。
    新华社香港12月4日电　据港台报纸报道，台湾“三项公职人员选举”已经结束。“台独”势力在这次选举中急剧膨胀，许多极力主张“台独”的人当选进入政坛，引起台湾各界的关注和忧虑。
    据报道，在这次选举中，强烈主张“台独”的所谓“新国家联线”32名候选人，有8人当选“立法委员”、12人当选“省议员”，致使台湾政坛内“台独”派的公职人员数目暴增。
    有关报道指出，在选举中，“新国家联线”公开提出了“新国家、新宪法”的“台独”诉求，台湾当局态度暖昧，基本上采取“宽容”态度，致使“台独”气焰高涨。
    台湾有关人士认为，台湾在解除戒严后的首次大选，海外“台独”分子活动纷纷向岛内集中，为参选的“台独”主张者大造声势。
    选举结果表明，“台独”在台湾已不限于言论，而且见诸行动，不止在社会上鼓吹，而且已经直接进入台湾权力机构中。预料今后台湾政坛上的“统”、“独”斗争将会更形公开化，对抗更尖锐。“台独”势力膨胀，对台湾政局的稳定以至对中国的和平统一都带来隐忧。
