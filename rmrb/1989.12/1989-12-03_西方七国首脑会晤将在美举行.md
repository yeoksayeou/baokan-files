The White House spokesman announced on December 1 in Valletta that the next summit of the seven Western countries will be held from July 9 to 11, 1990, in Houston, Texas, USA.

The statement said that the 1990 summit of the seven countries will focus on economic issues and other major international problems.

Soviet leader Gorbachev had sent a letter to the leaders of the seven countries during their summit in Paris in July this year, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to participate in the summit. However, the Soviet Union's request was rejected. It is reported that the Soviet Union still hopes to participate in the Houston summit of the seven countries to be chaired by U.S. President Bush next year.

    苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫曾于今年七月七国首脑在巴黎会晤时致信七国领导人，表示苏联愿意参加这一首脑会晤。但苏联的请求遭到拒绝。据报道，苏联仍想参加明年由美国总统布什主持的休斯敦七国首脑会议。
