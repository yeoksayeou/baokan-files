"Our factory's success today is due to Comrade Liu first and foremost!" "With leaders like Comrade Liu, how can the enterprise not thrive?"
"If all party members were like Comrade Liu, there would be no corruption within the party!" ... The staff and workers eagerly told us.

Who is "Comrade Liu"? He is Liu Liyun, a national labor model in the textile industry, a representative of the provincial people's congress, an outstanding party member, and a recipient of the first-class merit award—Director and Party Secretary of the Suyang County Garment Factory in Jiangsu Province.

A Broad Mind

In 1982, Suyang County Garment Factory was in dire straits: products were piling up, workers hadn't received their wages for months, and many were requesting transfers. Liu Liyun, then 45 years old, took over as the director. He identified the factory's problems and prescribed "three remedies": first, he broke through numerous obstacles to pioneer the director responsibility system, smashed the iron rice bowl, and implemented a piecework wage system; second, he recruited capable people, vigorously developed export garment production, and focused on product development and quality; third, he updated the equipment, importing over 200 advanced machines from Japan. As a result, the factory's appearance changed rapidly.

Liu Liyun has a fiery passion and strong sense of duty towards his work. As his wife puts it, "The factory is his home; when he works, he doesn't care about his own life." Last winter, Liu Liyun suffered from a persistent fever due to overwork. He insisted on calling a production meeting while wrapped in a quilt. Once, Liu Liyun was involved in a car accident while on a business trip, sustaining severe injuries to his head, waist, and chest, and remained unconscious for two days. However, upon regaining consciousness, his first words were, "Have the shirts for Italy been shipped?"

When he heard that the goods had been sent on time, a smile of relief finally appeared on his face.

Liu Liyun's hard work and dedication for the factory have yielded the results he sought: the enterprise climbed from the valley to the peak, increasing its product varieties by over 30, and exporting to more than 30 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Italy, and Canada. Over the past six years, it has paid the state 2.1 million yuan in taxes and profits, and earned over 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

A Deep Heart

Liu Liyun always thinks of the workers, using a deep heart to do ideological and political work, and bringing the warmth of the party to the workers' hearts. In the spring of 1984, Liu Liyun was working in the workshop and noticed that some workers were always frowning. He dug deeper and found out that these workers were worried about their children's employment. He immediately called a meeting of the cadres to discuss the matter and contacted relevant county departments to formulate the factory's recruitment implementation plan according to state regulations. That year, he arranged for 13 children of workers to be employed, thus solving the workers' worries.

In the autumn of 1987, an old worker in the factory was in financial difficulty and ill at home. Liu Liyun lent him 1,000 yuan for treatment and personally arranged for him to be taken to the provincial capital for treatment. Liu Liyun also visited him and had the hospital fees fully covered by the factory. This old worker, who used to often complain, tightly held Liu Liyun's hand and shed tears of gratitude.

For workers who have made mistakes, Liu Liyun does not shun or neglect them but patiently educates them and utilizes their strengths. Worker Chen Zhongming from the third workshop had been detained by the public security bureau. Initially, he was depressed and hopeless. Liu Liyun visited him multiple times for heart-to-heart talks and taught him technical skills and management. This allowed Chen to put down his burden, study technology, and work hard. He became the workshop's team leader and this year was awarded the title of municipal excellent worker.

A Clean Style

People say that now, enterprise cadres have to pass "four tests": first, the money test; second, the relationships test; third, the power test; and fourth, the comfort test. How does Liu Liyun fare in these areas?

In March of this year, a private entrepreneur from Liaoning learned that the Suyang Garment Factory's domestically sold silk shirts were stylish, affordable, and of good quality. He specially came to purchase them but was afraid that "good things don't come cheap," so he secretly went to Liu Liyun's home and slipped an envelope full of money into Liu Liyun's hand. However, Liu Liyun immediately returned it and gave him a scolding.

Recently, a relative from Liu Liyun's hometown came to find him for a job at the factory, but since he did not meet the factory's regulations, Liu Liyun did not agree. This relative, seeing Liu Liyun so strict, angrily said, "Others in power, their friends and relatives benefit. You're good, you even neglect your relatives' feelings." Liu Liyun calmly said, "How can we neglect relatives' feelings? In the old society, it was popular to say 'one person gains enlightenment, chickens and dogs ascend to heaven.' How can Communist Party cadres do such things!"

Liu Liyun said well: "Because we are party members, we must be clean and selfless, and we must bring honor to the party."

### 党员就要为党增光添彩

    党员就要为党增光添彩
    沈根　王凤君
    “咱厂能有今天，首先要给刘师傅记头功！”“有刘师傅这样勇于开拓的人当领导，企业怎能不兴旺？”
  “共产党员要都像刘师傅那样，党内就不会有腐败现象啦！”……干部职工争相对我们说。
      “刘师傅”何许人也？他就是全国纺织系统劳动模范、省人大代表、优秀共产党员和一等功荣立者——江苏沭阳县服装厂厂长兼党总支书记刘立云。
                博大的胸怀
    一九八二年，沭阳县服装厂陷入困境：产品积压，职工几个月拿不上工资，纷纷要求调离。四十五岁的刘立云，出任了厂长。他针对厂子存在的“病症”，大刀阔斧地开了“三剂药方”：一是冲破重重阻力，率先推行厂长负责制，砸掉铁饭碗，实行计件工资制；二是启用能人，大力发展出口服装生产，狠抓产品开发和产品质量；三是更新设备，从日本引进二百多台先进机器。从而很快使厂子面貌大变。
    刘立云对工作有火一般的热情和强烈的事业心，用他老伴的话说：“厂子就是他的家，他干起工作来就不要命。”去年隆冬，刘立云因疲劳过度低烧持续不退，他硬是裹着被子召开生产调度会。一次，刘立云外出洽谈业务不幸遇到车祸，头、腰、胸多处受重伤，连续昏迷了两天，可他苏醒后的第一句话就是：
  “给意大利的衬衫运走了么？”当他听说货已按时发出时，脸上才露出欣慰的微笑。
    刘立云为工厂付出辛勤的劳动和心血，得到了自己企求的“报偿”：企业从低谷攀上山巅，产品增加了三十多个品种，远销美国、日本、意大利、加拿大等三十多个国家和地区，六年来上交国家税利二百一十万元，为国创汇一千多万美元。
                深沉的爱心
    刘立云心中时时想着职工，用一颗深沉的爱心，把思想政治工作做到点子上，将党的温暖送到职工们的心坎里。一九八四年春天，刘立云在车间劳动时发现有的职工整天愁眉苦脸，就刨根问底，原来这些职工是在为子女就业无门犯难。他立即召开干部会进行专门研究，并与县有关部门联系，按照国家有关规定制定了厂招工实施办法，当年就安排职工子女就业十三人，从而解决了职工的后顾之忧。
      一九八七年秋天，厂里有位老职工经济拮据，患病在家。刘立云主动借了一千元给他治病，亲自联系车子送他去省城住院治疗。刘立云还特地去看望他，并将其住院费用全部由工厂承担下来。这位曾经爱说
  “怪话”的老职工，紧紧握住刘立云的手，流下了热泪。
    对于有过失的职工，刘立云也不嫌弃、不冷落，耐心教育，用其所长。机工三车间青工陈中明曾被公安机关拘留过，起初他自悲、绝望，一蹶不振。刘立云一面多次找他促膝谈心，一面向他传技术、教管理。从而使小陈放下包袱，钻研技术，拚命工作，担任了车间班长，今年他又获市优质能手称号。
                  清廉的作风
    人们说，如今企业干部难过“四关”：一是金钱关，二是人情关，三是权力关，四是安乐关。刘立云在这些方面做得如何？
    今年三月，辽宁一家个体户获悉沭阳服装厂生产的内销府绸衬衫款式新、价格廉、质量好，专程前来购买，但又怕“好货不便宜”，就悄悄摸到刘立云家，将一只装满人民币的信封塞到刘立云手中，不料被刘立云当场退回，还挨了一顿批评。
    前不久，刘立云有个乡下亲戚想进厂做工找上门来，因不符合厂里规定，刘立云没同意。这个亲戚见刘立云这样认真，生气地说：“别人当官，亲友们跟着沾光。你倒好，亲戚之情都撂开了。”刘立云心平气和地说：“亲戚之情，咱哪能撂开？旧社会时兴
  ‘一人得道，鸡犬升天’，共产党的干部哪能搞这一套！”
    刘立云说得好：“我们因为是党员，所以，就必须清正廉洁克己奉公，就要为党增光添彩。”
