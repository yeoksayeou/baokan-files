New York, December 29 (Xinhua News Agency, reporter Qian Wenrong) The Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Economics in the U.S. recently held its 5th annual meeting at the University of Pittsburgh. The meeting discussed the current status and prospects of China's economic reform, aiming to contribute strategies for the country's reform and opening-up.

From December 23 to 24, more than 70 Chinese students and visiting scholars from across the United States gathered to engage in heated discussions on China's economic reform. Nearly 20 papers were presented, including "On China's Economic Future," "Policy Choices for China's Economic System Reform," "The Transfer of Agricultural Labor and Its Impact on Prices," and "Western Economic Sanctions Against China and the International Environment for China's Continued Opening-Up Policy."

Xu Tianzhi, the chairman of the organizing committee for this year's meeting and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh, stated that the Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Economics in the U.S. will continue to adhere to the two principles of serving China's reform and opening-up and serving economic research in China. He also expressed that the association will maintain close ties with the motherland and strive to feedback the research results of its members to China in a timely manner.

The Chinese Students and Scholars Association for Economics in the U.S. is the largest academic organization for Chinese students and visiting scholars in North America, with over 360 members, including undergraduate and graduate students majoring in economics, as well as postdoctoral researchers.

Nobel laureate in economics Professor Simon, University of Pittsburgh President Pasquerella, and Professor Zheng Zhuyuan from Indiana University, among others, delivered speeches at the meeting. Officials from the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco and the Chinese Consulate General in New York were also invited to attend the meeting.
