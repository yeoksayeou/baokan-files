It seems unfair to say that today's Chinese people do not value education. Over the past decade of reform and opening up, our educational undertakings have indeed developed quite rapidly. Parents are almost all of the type who want their children to succeed, doing everything possible to get them into key kindergartens, key primary schools, key middle schools, and ultimately into universities, and even abroad. Governments at all levels generally strive to do a few practical things for education every year.

However, looking back, our biggest mistake in recent years has been precisely in the area of education.

Where is the problem? The issue lies in understanding education as merely intellectual development, merely as a means to higher education and academic qualifications. This is a one-sided view.

From the perspective of the entire nation, our country's realization of socialist modernization cannot do without the improvement of the overall quality of the nation. Without a new generation of people who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, not only will the Four Modernizations fail, but the achievements of socialism that have already been made may be lost, and the rights and interests that the working people have already obtained may be lost again.

From the perspective of the future of each young individual, to be able to adapt to the needs of the flourishing development of socialist modernization in the next century, to be able to achieve great things in the new historical period, one must not only avoid losing direction in the face of complex situations but also avoid being mediocre and ineffective. This requires comprehensive development, not just the pursuit of a certain level of academic qualifications. Moreover, in a fairly long historical period, it is also impossible for everyone to achieve the highest level of academic qualifications.

To improve and enhance the education of the next generation, we must not only rely on the improvement of classroom education in schools but also need the efforts of the entire society. Providing high-quality extracurricular reading materials for young people is also an important and indispensable part of this effort.

The importance of extracurricular reading materials seems to have not been fully recognized by all teachers and parents. Some teachers always fill up the children's after-school time with heavy homework, unwilling to leave them any time to read "leisure books." Some parents, when they see their children reading "leisure books," also tend to suspect that the school has given too little homework or that the children are not doing their homework seriously.

I believe that the importance of extracurricular reading materials is not inferior to textbooks.

School textbooks are compiled based on the structure of knowledge and the principle of gradual progression, according to the teaching outline, and are carefully selected and edited. They are relatively rigorous, concise, and stable. At the same time, they are also difficult (and should not be required) to be very rich, difficult to absorb the latest knowledge, and difficult to meet the diverse needs of young people in different regions and situations. Human knowledge is indeed an infinitely rich and varied kaleidoscope. Each child's interests, hobbies, and cognitive strengths are different, and their future development prospects are also varied. How to satisfy their thirst for knowledge and enable them to gain as rich knowledge as possible in their youth cannot but rely on extracurricular reading materials.

The boundless nature of knowledge and its continuous development require members of modern society to treat learning as a lifelong pursuit, learning until old age. The learning in school can only lay a basic foundation for future work. This foundation includes not only the most necessary basic knowledge but also the habit of self-study and the method of continuously seeking new knowledge. Ultimately, learning depends on oneself. Extracurricular reading is an important means of cultivating the habit of self-study and mastering the method of self-study.

The key is to provide young people with sufficient, high-quality reading materials. Extracurricular reading is different from classroom reading and cannot have a strict plan. The choice is greater, and if not handled properly, some harmful materials will corrupt the minds of young people. The situation in this regard was quite serious in the previous period. However, writing excellent youth reading materials, especially children's reading materials, is quite difficult. In some respects, it can be said to be more difficult than writing books for adults. This is because it also needs to consider the reading interests, comprehension level, and other psychological characteristics of young people, and it must be both scientific and accurate, as well as popular, lively, and interesting. This is quite demanding for the author. Therefore, doing this well requires the care of the Party and the state, and the concerted efforts of all parties.

Over the past decade, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized the strategic significance of educational work, stressing that many things must start from childhood, pointing out that education must face the future, the world, and modernization, and cultivate socialist new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. In 1978, under the unified arrangement of the national publishing department, the China Children's Press began to prepare for the editing of the "Youth Encyclopedia Series." This is the first large-scale knowledge-oriented series for young people since the founding of New China. After more than ten years of effort, it has been completed with 200 volumes. This year, 120 volumes have been selected and supplied in sets. This is good news for the broad masses of young people and a very worthy event to celebrate.

Just as the healthy growth of a child's body requires the absorption of comprehensive nutrition, the spiritual nourishment provided to children should also be comprehensive. Editing and publishing series of books for young people can systematically and comprehensively meet the needs of young people's all-around development. The "Youth Encyclopedia Series" selection now placed before the readers includes 64 volumes of natural science books, 40 volumes of social science books, and 16 volumes of literary knowledge, with a relatively appropriate configuration. Each field of knowledge also forms several small series, such as "Scientific Discoveries" (1-7), "Stories of Modern Chinese Scientists" (1-4), "Today's Science" (1-5), "Chinese History Stories" (1-17), "Stories of Chinese Revolutionary History" (1-6), "Foreign History Stories" (1-5), "Stories of Chinese Writers" (1-3), etc. Plus several single-volume works, this series of books can highlight the key points while being rich and varied. The only slight shortcoming is the lack of content on moral cultivation, although it is permeated in many books, but there is a lack of concentrated discussion.

Operating a high-quality series of books is not an easy task. The "Youth Encyclopedia Series" has been ten years since the first volume was published. The young readers of that time have now become young adults, and some have even become adults. Most of our series of books are edited and published one by one, and ordinary readers find it difficult to get a complete set. Although the publishers carefully plan the content of the series, it is still similar to several separate volumes when it reaches the readers. Especially for children's books, due to the time required to complete a series often exceeds the duration of a person's childhood, most young readers have few opportunities to see the various books they need, and they can only buy and read whatever they encounter. Therefore, I have always advocated that youth reading materials should be supplied in sets, just like a nutritionist's meal plan, considering the proportion of nutrition carefully, which is more beneficial to teachers, parents, and young readers. In recent years, several small series have been gradually published in sets, and this year, there are large-scale series such as the "Youth Encyclopedia Series" (Selection) and the "Little Library Series" for young readers, which is a major piece of good news for the publishing industry. It will have an important role in consolidating the achievements of the anti-pornography campaign and in the growth of a new generation. The "Youth Encyclopedia Series" (Selection) was in short supply as soon as it was published, and many schools, teachers, and parents have requested reprints, indicating its popularity. I hope that the comrades in the publishing industry will continue to work hard on the basis of their achievements and edit our own "Youth Encyclopedia" and "Children's Encyclopedia Series." I believe this is also the expectation of the young readers.

    为新一代提供高质量精神食粮
    ——祝少年百科丛书精选本成套供应
    余心言
    说今天的中国人不重视教育，似乎有点冤枉。改革开放十年来，我们的教育事业确实有了相当快的发展。家长们又几乎都是望子成龙型的，千方百计把孩子往重点幼儿园、重点小学、重点中学里挤，最后的目标就是要挤进大学里去，以至于挤出洋。各级政府也大抵年年都在为教育程度不同地办几件实事。
    然而，回顾起来，我们这几年最大的失误，又恰恰正是在教育问题上。
    毛病出在哪里？把教育仅仅理解为智育，仅仅理解为升学，学历。这是一种片面性。
    从整个民族的角度看，我们的国家要实现社会主义现代化，离不开整个民族素质的提高。如果没有“有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律”的一代新人，不但四个现代化搞不成，而且社会主义已经取得的成果都有可能丧失，劳动人民已经得到的权利和利益也有可能重新丢掉。
    从每一位青少年个人的未来前途考虑，要能够适应下一个世纪社会主义现代化事业蓬勃发展的需要，能够在新的历史时期建功立业，既不会在复杂的形势面前迷失方向，又不至于庸庸碌碌、无所作为，也需要全面地发展，而不能仅仅满足于取得某种程度的学历。何况，在相当长的历史时期中，也决不可能做到人人都取得最高程度的学历。
    要改进和提高对下一代的教育，既要寄希望于学校课堂教育的改进，也需要全社会的努力。为青少年提供高质量的课外读物，也是这种努力的一种重要的不可缺少的组成部分。
    关于课外读物的重要意义，好像至今还远没有被所有的教师和家长所充分认识。有的教师总是用繁重的作业把孩子们的课余时间全部填满，不愿意给他们留一点看“闲书”的时间。有的家长看到孩子看“闲书”时，也难免要怀疑学校留的作业太少，或者是孩子做作业不认真。
    我认为，课外读物的重要意义，是不在课本以下的。
    学校的课本是根据知识体系的结构和循序渐进的原则，按照教学大纲，精选精编而成的。它比较严谨、洗练，也比较稳定。同时也就难以（也不应当要求）做到十分丰满，难以及时吸取最新的知识成果，难以适应不同地区、不同情况的青少年的多种需要。人类已知的知识实在是一个无限丰富多采的万花筒。每一个孩子的兴趣、爱好、思维优势又各不相同，他们未来的发展前途也是各种各样的。如何满足他们的求知渴望，使他们能在少年时代及早地获得尽可能丰富的知识，就不能不依赖于课外读物。
    知识的无涯和它日新月异的不断发展，要求现代社会成员把学习作为终身的事业，活到老，学到老。在学校阶段的学习只能是为日后的工作打下一个起码的基础。这个基础既包括最必要的基本知识，更包括养成自学的习惯和掌握不断求得新知的方法。学习，归根到底要靠自己学。课外阅读正是养成自学习惯和掌握自学方法的重要途径。
    问题在于应当向青少年提供足够的、高质量的读物。课外阅读和课内不同，不可能有严格的计划，选择性比较大，弄得不好，一些不良读物就会腐蚀青少年的心灵。前一段时期这方面的情况不能说不是相当严重的。而优秀的青少年读物尤其是少年读物撰写颇为不易，某些方面可以说比写给成年人看的书困难更大些。因为它还要照顾到青少年的阅读兴趣、理解程度和其他心理特点，既要做到科学、准确，又要做到通俗、生动有趣。这对作者来说是相当费力的。因此，做好这件事，需要党和国家的关怀，需要各方面的通力协作。
    十多年来，邓小平同志一再强调教育工作的重要战略意义，强调许多事情都要从娃娃抓起，指出教育要面向未来，面向世界，面向现代化，要培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人。1978年，中国少年儿童出版社在国家出版部门统一部署下，开始着手筹备编辑《少年百科丛书》。这是新中国成立以来第一套以少年为对象的大型知识性丛书。经过十余年的努力，已经出齐了200种。今年又从中精选120种成套供应。这是广大少年的喜讯，也是一件十分值得祝贺的大好事。
    正像孩子身体的健康成长需要吸收全面的营养，给孩子提供的精神食粮的营养应当是全面的。编辑出版青少年读物的丛书，可以有计划地全面地满足青少年全面成长的需要。现在放在读者面前的《少年百科丛书》精选本，包括自然知识读物64种，社会知识读物40种，文学知识16种，配置是比较恰当的。其中各门知识又形成了若干小的系列，例如《科学的发现》（1—7）、《中国现代科学家的故事》（1—4）、《今天的科学》（1—5）、《中国历史故事》（1—17）、《中国革命历史故事》（1—6）、《外国历史故事》（1—5）、《中国文学家的故事》（1—3）等。再加上若干单本的著作，就使得这套丛书既能突出重点，又显得丰富多采。略嫌不足的是有关道德修养的内容，虽然在许多本书中都有所渗透，但缺少专门的集中的论述。
    经营一部高质量丛书，不是容易的事。《少年百科丛书》从其中的第一本问世至今已经过了10年。当年的小读者今天已经成了青年，有的甚至已是成年人了。我国的各种丛书，大多是编好一本出一本，普通的读者很难买得齐全。尽管出版者对丛书的内容精心地规划，到读者手里还是同若干单行本差不多。尤其是少年读物，由于出齐一套丛书需要的时间往往超过一个人少年阶段的年限，大多数少年读者很少有可能看到他所需要的各种书籍，实际上只能是碰到什么买什么，碰到什么看什么。所以，我历来主张，青少年读物最好能够成套地供应。好比是营养师配餐，把营养的比例考虑周到，对老师、家长和少年读者都比较有利。这几年已陆续有一些成套供应的小丛书问世，今年又有《少年百科丛书》（精选本）和《小图书馆丛书》这样大型的以少年为读者对象的丛书成套出版供应，是出版界的一大喜讯，对于巩固扫黄的成果，对于一代新人的成长，都将有重要的作用。《少年百科丛书》（精选本）一出版就供不应求，许多学校、教师、家长纷纷要求再版，说明了它受欢迎的程度。我希望出版界的同志们在已经取得成就的基础上继续努力，编出我们自己的《少年百科全书》和《儿童百科丛书》。我相信，这也是小读者们的期待。
