Title: Symphony of Forest and Sea – An Impression of Poet Sun Jingxuan
Author: Liú Bīnfū
Date: 1989-12-15
Edition: 8

Sun Jingxuan, this revolutionary martyr's orphan who joined the revolution at the age of thirteen, has served as a propagandist, clerk, instructor, normal school teacher, reporter, magazine editor, and professional writer. He has experienced the trials of the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and twenty years of hardship and turmoil. The poet, now in his sixties, walks with a vigorous stride, has a graceful demeanor, and a heart as pure as a child's. Looking back, his selected poems, a collection titled "Sun Jingxuan's Poetry Selection," is about to be published.

In 1957, just before his voice was abruptly silenced, he had already published three poetry collections. He gained fame in the literary world with his poetic sequences "Forest Lyric Poems" and "Ocean Lyric Poems." If we consider his poetic works up to now as a unique symphony, its introduction and exposition are striking, simple, natural, unadorned, fresh, and transparent. Its development section is filled with rests, just like many outstanding poets, for twenty-two years he sang in his heart! Its recapitulation is grand and magnificent, fully embodying the achievements of his creation and the value of his life, illuminating his spiritual journey. In 1978 and 1979, he successively published two long poems of ten thousand lines each, "Son of the Yellow River" and "Seventy-Two Days." The "One Hundred Lyric Poems" published in 1983 are all short poems of a few lines or a dozen lines, like the subtle tremors and melodies between the peaks and troughs of waves after a climax in a musical piece, fresh and bright, with a hint of subtle sadness.

From Sun Jingxuan's poetry as a whole, one can see his inheritance of traditional literary essence and his borrowing from Western classical and modern poetry art.

Not long ago, I met Jingxuan, who was busy dealing with some difficulties in social welfare activities. This "poet football fan" was engrossed in the exciting scenes of the Italian Serie A football league on the television screen, occasionally clapping and sighing. It seemed as if he wanted to play for me the brilliant segment of that symphony.

    森林与海洋的交响
    ——诗人孙静轩印象
    刘斌夫
    孙静轩，这位十三岁就投身革命的烈士遗孤，曾做过宣传员、文书、指导员、师范教员、记者、报刊编辑和专业作家，经历过抗日战争、解放战争和二十年重轭的风雨血火。年及花甲的诗人，步履矫健，风度超逸，心如童真。蓦然回首，精选诗作，一本《孙静轩诗选》即将面世了。
    1957年中秋他的歌喉戛然中断前夕，已出过三本诗集，并以组诗《森林抒情诗》和《海洋抒情诗》饮誉诗坛。如果说他截今为止的诗作是一部奇特的交响乐，它的引子和呈示部先声夺人，单纯，自然，朴实，清新，透明；它的展开部全是休止符，同许多优秀的诗人一样，二十二年全在心底里默唱！它的再现部宏大而辉煌，足以体现创作的实绩和生命的价值，彪炳他的心灵历程。1978、1979两年先后出版两部万行长诗《黄河的儿子》和《七十二天》。1983年出版的《抒情诗一百首》，全是收的数行或十来行的短诗，仿佛乐章中一个高潮过去新的高潮来临之前的波峰浪谷间，那些微妙的颤音和琴声，清新、明快中隐隐透出淡淡的忧郁。
    从静轩诗歌整体中可以窥见他对传统文学精粹的承继和对西方古典、现代诗歌艺术的借鉴。
    前不久见到静轩，正值他悉心处理社会公益活动的某种困窘的间隙。这位“球迷诗人”正沉醉于电视屏幕上意大利足球甲级精英联赛的精彩镜头，时而击节而叹。好似要为我弹奏那部交响乐的华彩乐段。
