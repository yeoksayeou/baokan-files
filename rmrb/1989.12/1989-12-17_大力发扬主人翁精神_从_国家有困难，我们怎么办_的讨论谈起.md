A warm current has touched the hearts of 27,000 employees of the Shanghai Clock and Watch Factory through a company-wide discussion on the topic "What should we do when the country faces difficulties?" This discussion has made the broad masses of cadres and workers realize that while the current economic situation is improving, there are still many difficulties ahead, increasing their sense of urgency. It has also ignited a spirit of overcoming difficulties and forging ahead. Taking on the burdens of the enterprise and helping the country out of difficulties has become the spontaneous action of the broad masses of cadres and workers. This discussion has sparked a heated response in the Shanghai light industry system and other sectors. The Shanghai working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has once again demonstrated a high sense of responsibility and mastery at a critical moment when the country and enterprises face temporary economic difficulties, showing the heroic character of the working class as the leading class of the state.

Currently, we are implementing the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party to further rectify and deepen reforms. Rectification and deepening of reforms inevitably involve both strengthening and eliminating, both supporting and suppressing, both strengthening and eliminating. Therefore, some enterprises will face situations such as lack of funds, insufficient production, product accumulation, and even shutdowns and mergers. This will also affect the immediate interests of some workers, impacting their income to a certain extent. People's thoughts and emotions are bound to fluctuate in various ways. In such a situation, we should, like the Shanghai Clock and Watch Factory Party organization, on the one hand, honestly inform the workers of the country's difficulties and the enterprise's situation, so that they understand the country's hardships, know the big picture, and have a broad perspective. On the other hand, we should genuinely rely on the masses, mobilize their wisdom, and pool their strengths to find ways to overcome difficulties. The vast majority of the workers have political awareness and a sense of responsibility and mastery. Consulting them on matters and seeking their advice and strategies is the best way to overcome difficulties.

Promoting the spirit of mastery is determined by the nature of our society. We are a socialist country, and the working people are the masters of the state. The ancient saying "The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every individual" can only become a vibrant reality under socialist conditions. This is because the fundamental interests of the state and the fundamental interests of the people are closely related. Only when the country prospers can individuals be wealthy and happy. Therefore, the people naturally regard the country's difficulties as their own difficulties and regard the revitalization of the nation as their own responsibility. The practice of socialist construction over the past 40 years has repeatedly proven this. In the early 1960s, our country faced enormous economic difficulties, but our people, without complaint, voluntarily and confidently, with a spirit of optimism, fought against difficulties under the leadership of the Party, quickly overcoming the difficulties. In the 10 years of reform and opening up, it was again our people who, with unprecedented initiative and pioneering spirit, threw themselves into the reform tide, voluntarily and confidently contributing to the reform and socialist modernization cause. All this shows that the spirit of mastery is deeply rooted in the hearts of our people as a noble virtue.

The spirit of mastery is an extremely powerful spiritual force. To fully unleash this great spiritual force, we must rely on strong, lively, and vivid ideological and political work, continuously carrying out ideological education. Now, some cadres do not regard the workers as the masters of the state and the enterprise, and their responsibility is to serve the workers. In addition, in recent years, the bourgeois liberalization trend has spread, and ideas such as "everything for money" and the employment perspective have emerged, causing the spirit of mastery in some workers to weaken. Therefore, on the one hand, leading cadres at all levels must further establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, fully respect the position of the workers as masters, and create more and better opportunities for them to exercise their master's rights. On the other hand, we must strengthen guidance, strengthen education, and vigorously advocate for "being the master of the house," "selfless dedication," "hard work," and "taking on heavy responsibilities," fully unleashing the great enthusiasm and initiative hidden among the people. The practice of the Shanghai Clock and Watch Factory provides us with valuable inspiration.

In a few days, we will enter the 1990s. The future is bright, but the road is tortuous. Since we have overcome such serious difficulties as in the early 1960s, today's difficulties can certainly be overcome. We are full of confidence in victory. The key is that the whole nation must have a spirit, a spirit. As long as we fully mobilize the people and fully mobilize the positive factors on all sides, with everyone promoting the spirit of the country's masters, taking on the country's difficulties, and contributing to the country's development, we will certainly overcome the temporary difficulties and achieve new victories.

    大力发扬主人翁精神
    ——从“国家有困难，我们怎么办”的讨论谈起
    本报评论员
    一股暖流叩击着上海钟表公司27000名职工的心扉，这就是在全公司开展的“国家有困难，我们怎么办”的大讨论。这场讨论使广大干部职工看清了当前经济形势虽然在向好的方向发展，但仍面临许多困难，增加了紧迫感；同时更激发起克服困难、勇往直前的豪情壮志。为企业分忧，为国家排难，正在变成广大干部职工的自觉行动。这场讨论，在上海轻工系统和其它战线已引起热烈的反应。具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级，在国家和企业的经济面临暂时困难的关键时刻，又一次表现出了高度的主人翁责任感，显示了工人阶级作为国家领导阶级的英雄本色。
    当前，我们正在贯彻党的十三届五中全会关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定。治理整顿必然有上有下，有保有压，有加强有淘汰。因此，某些企业会面临资金短缺、开工不足、产品积压，甚至关停并转的局面；也会波及到一些职工的切身利益，使他们的收入受到一定的影响。人们的思想情绪难免有这样那样的波动。在这种情况下，就应当像上海钟表公司党组织那样，一方面，把国家的困难、企业的处境如实地告诉职工群众，使他们理解国家的难处，明大义，识大体。另一方面，又真心实意地依靠群众，发挥他们的聪明才智，群策群力，找出克服困难的办法。绝大多数职工群众是有政治觉悟和主人翁责任感的，有事情找他们商量，请他们献计献策，是战胜困难最好的办法。
    发扬主人翁精神是我国的社会性质决定的。我们是社会主义国家，劳动人民是国家的主人。“天下兴亡，匹夫有责”这句古话，只有在社会主义条件下才能变成生气勃勃的现实。这是因为，国家的根本利益和人民群众的根本利益息息相关，只有国家兴旺发达，才能有个人的富裕幸福。因而，人民群众理所当然地把国家的困难看作自己的困难，把民族的振兴看作自己的职责。建国40年来社会主义建设事业的实践不断地证明了这一点。60年代初，我国经济面临巨大困难，但我们的人民毫无怨言，自觉自愿地在党的领导下，充满自信和乐观精神与困难作斗争，迅速摆脱了困境。改革开放10年，又是我们的人民，以前所未有的主动精神和首创精神，投入改革洪流，自觉自愿地为改革和社会主义现代化事业添砖加瓦。这些都说明，主人翁责任感是深深植根于我国人民群众心灵深处的一种高尚的美德。
    主人翁精神是一种极其巨大的精神力量。要使这种巨大的精神力量充分发挥出来，必须靠强有力的、生动活泼的思想政治工作，不断进行思想的灌输和教育。现在有些干部，没有把职工群众看作是国家的和企业的主人，自己的职责是为职工群众服务，再加上这些年来，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，“一切向钱看”的思想、雇佣观点等等有所抬头，一部分职工群众的主人翁意识淡漠了。因此，一方面各级领导干部要进一步树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，充分尊重群众的主人翁地位，为他们行使主人权利创造更多更好的机会，另一方面要加强引导，加强教育，大力提倡“当家做主”、“无私奉献”、“艰苦奋斗”、“勇挑重担”，把蕴藏在群众中的极大热情和积极性充分发挥出来。上海钟表公司的做法为我们提供了有益的启示。
    再过几天，我们就将跨入90年代了。前途是光明的，道路是曲折的。既然像60年代初那样严重的困难都可以克服，今天的困难更是完全可以战胜的，我们对此充满了必胜的信心。重要的是，举国上下要有一股志气，要有一种精神。只要把群众充分发动起来，把各方面的积极因素充分调动起来，人人都发扬国家主人翁的精神，争着分担国家的困难，争着为国家的发展出力，我们就一定能战胜暂时的困难，取得新的胜利。
