The land is crying out

Located in the Loess Plateau, Shanxi's arable land is decreasing at an alarming rate of 440,000 mu per year. Currently, the province has 2 mu of arable land per capita, slightly higher than the national average. However, due to the poor quality of the land and insufficient fertility, the yield per unit area is very low, with only 300 kg of grain per capita, lower than the national average.

Shanxi is a famous coal-producing province in China. Every year, more than 10,000 mu of land subsides due to coal mining. According to data from the Shanxi Provincial Land Management Bureau, to date, Shanxi has suffered varying degrees of damage to 700,000 mu of land due to coal mining subsidence. The extensive mining of small coal mines in rural areas, the construction of key projects, the establishment of township enterprises, and the construction of urban and rural residential buildings all consume a large amount of land. Just the bricks and tiles needed for construction consume 200,000 mu of good land each year.

Li Liguang, the secretary of the provincial party committee, and Wang Senhao, the governor, have called on all the people of Shanxi to pay attention to the crisis facing Shanxi's agriculture.

The members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress are also deeply worried about the reduction of arable land.

The land is crying out. We cannot only focus on the present and neglect the future; we cannot only seek personal gain and forget about future generations; we cannot only exploit nature and forget about nature's retribution.

From White to Green

The sharp decrease in arable land has drawn the attention of the provincial party committee and government, which have tasked the land, agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, discipline inspection, and supervision departments to conduct on-site investigations, propose countermeasures, and implement them. They have mobilized the masses to be self-reliant, develop land resources, and quickly reverse the passive situation.

From the banks of the Yellow River to the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, from the banks of the Sanggan River to the plains of Jinan, farmers in Shanxi have launched large-scale land development, reclaiming wasteland, hills, gullies, the Yellow River, Fen River floodplains, and saline-alkali areas for arable land. Lacking funds, various levels of government from the province to the village have raised funds; needing labor, farmers have voluntarily accumulated labor.

In the northern outskirts, the Yubei region has vast saline-alkali flats, flat and white, once barren. This year, more than 200,000 people have been involved in development and treatment, desalinating and pressing alkali, turning one piece at a time. Datong City raised 950,000 yuan, concentrated on completing the treatment of seven projects including Zhijiapu and Gudian, creating 10,000 mu of new land, and the green crops are particularly attractive. Ying County has 1.08 million mu of saline-alkali low-lying land, accounting for more than 73% of the county's plain arable land. The county party committee and government adopted the method of "easy first, difficult later, integrated development, concentrated and connected, and guaranteed water source," dividing the county's saline-alkali flats into seven areas, drilling 204 wells, and simultaneously laying power lines to improve irrigation conditions. Large areas of saline-alkali land have been turned into stable-yield fields, with an average yield of 250 kg per mu and a maximum of 450 kg.

Linfen City Mayor Liu Heping told the reporter: "The Fen River is a river with great mobility. It is often said that in thirty years, the east side of the river, and in forty years, the west side of the river. But it contains rich resources. The people of Linfen City will use a few years to dig out its treasures." In April this year, they raised 1 million yuan, organized farmers, urban and rural cadres, and workers to volunteer, and have built two flood control dikes and created 7,000 mu of land. Xiluqu Village alone has planted 2,000 mu of lotus, increasing per capita income by 1,000 yuan.

Hometown Soil, Hometown Affection

A Shanxi proverb says, "Whether or not relatives, the yellow soil is the root," and "People may not be close, but the soil is." Born in the yellow soil, grown in the yellow soil, and rooted in the yellow soil, the people have an endless affection for the land of their hometown.

In Lingchuan County, Taihang Mountains, there are 300 mu of "abandoned land" that has been abandoned for more than 10 years. The county government publicly tendered for reclamation, and the successful bidders were two retired teachers, Guo Zhenlong and Zheng Zhi Hong. They used their retirement settlement of 6,000 yuan to purchase reclamation tools and moved their entire family of 18 people into the mountains to settle. They have now reclaimed 40 mu of arable land and planted more than 1,000 trees. Someone said, "This person is too foolish, old and not enjoying the comforts of home, still going to the mountains to make trouble." They said: People have different aspirations, our aspiration is on the land, seeing the reclaimed yellow soil, our hearts are warm! In Gaoping County, Liujiatun Village, there is a "senior citizens' land development team" consisting of 26 elderly people. The youngest is 58 years old, and the oldest is 74 years old. They have developed more than 500 mu of land and planted more than 10,000 trees. They said: Holding a hoe is more enjoyable than holding a grandchild!

The reporter visited the young land reclamation developer Zheng Shuhua in the village of Gongcun, Beitian Town, Yuxi City. He is 34 years old, strong and sturdy. Since 1983, he has contracted a brick and tile kiln, earning more than 100,000 yuan in five years. He thought hard and found a new development path, finally choosing land reclamation. He said: "I made money selling yellow soil, and I want to return the wealth I earned to the land." Since 1987, he has contracted 60 mu of abandoned brick and tile kiln land in Gongcun, built 8 rooms, and moved his parents to live by the field. His father became the commander of his land development. So far, he has invested more than 70,000 yuan, drilled one well, and can irrigate 500 mu of land. He grows wheat, sorghum, vegetables, and medicinal herbs on the reclaimed land, and this year can earn more than 15,000 yuan.

To develop land resources, Shanxi villages have seen the emergence of "population fields" (parents create one mu of land for a newborn baby), "marriage fields" (newlyweds create one mu of land for future children), and "house-building fields" (homeowners create one mu of land for new residential plots). In many mountain villages, "mountain estates" have also appeared: individual or joint households go to the mountains to contract and develop barren mountains, developing diversified operations.

In just a few years, Shanxi's land development has achieved significant results. The province has 6.1 million mu of developable land, of which 3.5 million mu have been developed, accounting for more than 50% of the developable area. This year, the province has developed and reclaimed 186,000 mu of new land, with non-agricultural construction occupying more than 30,000 mu. After offsetting the increase and decrease, there is still a surplus of 155,000 mu. The comrades of the Shanxi Provincial Land Bureau call this situation a "historical turning point."

    为了一寸土
    ——山西开发土地资源记实
    本报记者　王艾生
    土地的呼喊
    地处黄土高原的山西，耕地正以每年44万亩的惊人速度减少。现在，全省人均耕地2亩，虽然略高于全国平均水平，但因土地贫瘠，肥力不足，单位面积产量很低，人均占有粮食仅300公斤，低于全国平均水平。
    山西是我国著名的煤炭之乡，每年有1万多亩土地因采煤而塌陷。据山西省土地管理局提供的资料，迄今为止，山西因采煤塌陷造成不同程度破坏的土地达70余万亩。大量乡村小煤窑的开采，重点工程的建设，乡镇企业的兴办，以及城乡居民盖房，无一不大量占用土地。仅建设需用的砖瓦，每年就要“吃”掉好地2万余亩。
    省委书记李立功，省长王森浩呼吁全省人民，重视山西农业面临的这一忧患。
    省人大常委会的委员们，也深深地为耕地减少而焦急。
    土地在呼喊，不能只顾眼前，不顾长远；不能只图自身受益而忘记子孙万代；不能只顾向自然索取而忘记大自然的惩罚。
    从白茫茫到绿旺旺
    耕地锐减，引起省委、省政府的高度重视，责成土地、农业、水利、林业、纪检、监察等部门实地调查，提出对策，并付诸实施，发动群众，不等不靠不要，自力更生，开发土地资源，尽快扭转被动局面。
    从黄河之滨到太行山麓，从桑干河畔到晋南平川，山西农民展开大规模的土地开发，向荒山、荒坡、荒沟，向黄河、汾河滩涂，向盐碱窝要耕地。缺资金，省、地、县、乡、村各级自筹；需劳力，农民自觉搞劳动积累。
    塞外高原，雁北地区有大片大片的盐碱滩地，平展展，白茫茫，昔日为不毛之地。今年已有20余万人在开发治理，排盐压碱，治一片成一片。大同市筹集资金95万余元，集中完成治理智家堡、古店等7处工程，新造地1万亩，绿旺旺的庄稼分外诱人。应县，共有盐碱低洼地108万亩，占该县平川耕地的73％以上。县委、县政府采取“先易后难，成龙配套，集中联片，保证水源”的办法，将全县的盐碱滩地划分为7片，新打机井204眼，并同时架设电线，改善灌溉条件，已将大片大片的盐碱地变为稳产田，平均亩产250公斤，最高达450公斤。
    临汾市市长刘和平对记者说：“汾河是条游荡性很大的河流，常说三十年河东，四十年河西。但它蕴藏丰富资源。临汾市人民要用几年，把它的宝挖出来。”今年4月间，他们筹资100万元，组织农民、城镇干部职工义务劳动，已筑起防洪坝两条，造地7000亩。仅西芦曲村就种藕2000多亩，人均增收1000元。
    家乡土　家乡情
    山西民谚说：“亲不亲，黄土根”，“人不亲土亲”。生在黄土地，长在黄土地，扎根在黄土地上的人们，对家乡的土地有绵绵不尽的眷恋。
    太行山上的陵川县曹庄乡，有已扔弃10多年的300亩“撂荒地”，县政府公开招标复耕，中标者竟是两位离休的老教师郭振龙、郑志红。他们用离休安家费6000元，购置垦荒工具，带着全家18口人，进入深山安家。现已垦出40亩耕地，种树1000余棵。有人说：“这人太傻，人都老了，不坐在家里享清福，还上山折腾。”他们说：人各有志，我们的志在土地上，看到垦出的黄土，心里热乎乎的！高平县刘家庙村有一个26位老人组成的“老人开发土地队”，年龄最小的58岁，最大的74岁，已开发出土地500多亩，种树1万多株，他们说：握镢柄比抱孙子更快活！
    记者在榆次市北田镇巩村村头，访问了青年土地复垦开发者郑树华。他34岁，膀大腰圆。1983年起他承包砖瓦窑，5年间，共获利10万余元。他左思右想找新的开发门路，最后选中土地复垦。他说：“我是卖黄土发的财，我还要把挣下的财富还给土地。”1987年起他承包了巩村废弃的旧砖瓦窑地60亩，盖房8间，将父母亲接到田边来住，父亲当了他开发土地的总指挥。目前已投资7万余元，打机井1眼，可浇地500亩。他在复耕地上种小麦、高粱、蔬菜及药材，今年可收入1.5万多元。
    为开发土地资源，山西农村出现了“人口田”（父母为新生婴儿造一亩田）、“结婚田”（新婚夫妇为将来的子女造一亩田）、“建房田”（新建住房占宅基，房主造一亩田）。在不少山村还出现了“山地庄园”：独户或联户进山承包开发荒山，发展多种经营。
    短短几年，山西的土地开发，已经取得明显效果。全省可开发的土地面积为610万亩，现已开发350万亩，占可开发面积的50％多。今年，全省新开发复垦土地18.6万亩，非农建设占地3万多亩，增减相抵，尚余15.5万亩。山西省土地局的同志把这种情况叫做“历史的转折”。
