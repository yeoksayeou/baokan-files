The Soviet team demonstrated superior technical skills in the Sino-Soviet ice hockey friendly match, defeating the Chinese national ice hockey team 9-1. This victory concluded their five-day tour with a perfect record of four wins.

The Soviet Gor'kiy Torpedo ice hockey team, which ranks 15th in the Soviet Union's top-tier league, started their tour by defeating the Harbin Youth Team 8-1. They then went on to defeat the Chinese national ice hockey team three times with scores of 8-1, 6-3, and 9-1.

Throughout the matches, the Soviet Gor'kiy Torpedo team showcased superior skills in offensive and defensive coordination, passing techniques, individual skills, and physical strength compared to the host team. The Chinese national ice hockey team, making their debut in Harbin this winter, showed improvements in overall coordination and individual skills. However, they struggled to keep up with the Soviet team's level of play, finding it challenging to adapt and respond effectively.

    中苏冰球友谊赛苏队技高一筹
    新华社哈尔滨12月14日电　（记者姬云程）今天晚上，来哈尔滨访问比赛的苏联高尔基鱼雷冰球队以9∶1的悬殊比分胜中国国家冰球队，从而以四战全胜的战绩结束了这次历时5天的中苏冰球友谊赛。
    苏联鱼雷冰球队是苏联全国甲级队联赛的第15名。在这次访华的四场比赛中，该队先以8∶1战胜哈尔滨青年队，后分别以8∶1、6∶3和9∶1三次战胜中国国家冰球队。
    综观各场比赛，苏联鱼雷冰球队在攻防配合、传带球技术以及队员的个人技术和体力等方面都明显超过主队。入冬以来首次在哈尔滨亮相的国家冰球队尽管在整体配合和个人技术上有一定的进步，但与苏联鱼雷冰球队较量，还是显得力不从心，难以应付。
