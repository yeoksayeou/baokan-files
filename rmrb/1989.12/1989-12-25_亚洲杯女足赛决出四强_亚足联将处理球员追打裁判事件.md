Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 24th.

The seventh edition of the Asian Cup Women's Football Tournament concluded its group stage matches today here. The four teams that advanced to the semifinals will compete on December 26th, with China facing Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei facing Japan.

In the afternoon, Japan, from Group B, defeated Nepal 14-0. However, another match did not go as smoothly. Hong Kong drew 0-0 with Indonesia but advanced due to a better goal difference. After the match, Indonesian players accused the Macau referee, Liang Manlin, of favoring Hong Kong, leading to them chasing and attacking the referee and throwing objects. The situation was eventually calmed down by the police. AFC Secretary-General Vilapan stated that the incident will be addressed tomorrow.

    亚洲杯女足赛决出四强
    亚足联将处理球员追打裁判事件
    本报香港12月24日电　第七届亚洲杯女子足球赛分组赛今天在这里结束。进入四强的队伍将于26日进行半决赛，由中国队对香港队，中国台北队对日本队。
    B组的日本队今天下午以14∶0大胜尼泊尔队。另一场赛事却不顺利，香港队0∶0战平印尼队后，靠净胜球多得以出线。比赛结束时，印尼队员认为澳门主裁判梁满林偏袒香港队，便追打裁判，投掷杂物。由于警察干预，得以平息。亚足联秘书长维拉潘表示，明天将对这一女足比赛鲜见事件作处理。（吴沛彝）
