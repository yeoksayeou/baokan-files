The report, with detailed data, discusses the situation of children in developing countries, pointing out that, according to current trends, more than 100 million children will die in the 1990s. Among them, 50 million will die from measles, dehydration, and pneumonia, three common childhood diseases that can be prevented and treated with inexpensive methods. In addition, several times this number of children will grow up malnourished, with damaged physical and mental health, and without education.

    发展中国家儿童状况堪忧
    本报北京十二月十二日讯　记者刘兆祥报道：一九九○年《世界儿童状况报告》今日由联合国儿童基金会在全世界范围内正式发表。报告以翔实的材料论述了发展中国家的儿童状况，指出，按照目前的趋势，九十年代将有一亿多儿童死去，其中五千万人死于麻疹、脱水和肺炎这三种儿童常见病，而这些疾病是可以用费用低廉的办法来预防和治疗的。此外，数倍于此的儿童将在营养不良、身心健康受损和没有文化的情况下长大成人。
