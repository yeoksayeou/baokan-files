Toilets leaking water is a headache for many. The new water-saving device "Anti-Leak Valve" developed by the national building materials sector has started mass production, and the problem of leaking toilets has been completely solved.

According to reports, the leakage rate of old-style toilets is as high as 26.26%, which means that at least 300 million cubic meters of tap water is wasted annually, equivalent to the production capacity of several large water plants.

The Anti-Leak Valve, designed and invented by mechanical expert and former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Machinery Industry Shen Hong, and successfully developed by Tangshan Fourth Plastic Factory, significantly improves the sealing performance of toilet tank components, which has important economic significance for urban water conservation. After being tested by 1.1 million users in 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the Anti-Leak Valve achieved a 100% leakage prevention rate. The Anti-Leak Valve has been recommended by the China Urban Water Supply Association as a water-saving device and has obtained national patent rights.

    马桶漏水已能解决
    本报北京12月20日讯　马桶漏水，令人头痛。国家建材部门新研制出的节水器具“克漏阀”开始大量应市，马桶漏水问题已完全能解决了。
    据介绍，旧式马桶漏水率高达26.26％，也就是说，一年至少有3亿立方米自来水，相当于几个大水厂的生产能力。
    由机械专家、原机械工业部副部长沈鸿设计发明、唐山第四塑料厂研制成功的克漏阀，大大提高了马桶水箱配件的密封性能，对城市节水有重要的经济意义。经19个省、市、自治区的1.1万个用户试用，克漏率达百分之百。克漏阀已被中国城镇供水协会推荐为节水器具，并获得国家专利权。
