The 10th summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council concluded today in Muscat, the capital of Oman, issuing a communiqué calling on the international community to strive for comprehensive and lasting peace in the Gulf region.

The communiqué urged the United Nations Security Council to support all efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Iran-Iraq conflict, including direct talks between the two countries under the supervision of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, as well as the exchange of prisoners of war.

The communiqué reaffirmed the Gulf Cooperation Council's support for the Palestinian people's uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and called on the international community to stop Israel's repression in the occupied territories.

The communiqué stated that, to ultimately resolve the Palestinian issue, the United Nations should organize an international peace conference for the Middle East, involving all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.

The communiqué said that the Gulf Cooperation Council supports the efforts of the Arab League's three-party committee to mediate the Lebanese crisis, and supports the newly elected Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and his national reconciliation government in implementing the Taif Agreement aimed at restoring national peace and stability. The communiqué called on all parties in Lebanon to exercise restraint and carefully overcome the current crisis.

This summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, held in the spirit of reviewing the past and looking to the future, affirmed the achievements made by member countries over the past year and proposed some plans and measures to further improve the lives of the people.

The communiqué said that during the meeting, the leaders of the participating countries agreed to mutually exempt industrial goods from tariffs, and decided that member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council would adopt a unified tariff on imported goods, with the exception of the United Arab Emirates for the time being.

The leaders of the six member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council expressed satisfaction with the cooperation agreement recently reached with the European Community. They are determined to take further measures to implement the unified economic agreement and create a Gulf common market.

In addition, the meeting made a series of regulations on issues such as the ownership of real estate by residents of member countries in another member country. Apart from economic issues, the communiqué said, the leaders of the participating countries also unanimously agreed to adopt unified military defense measures to ensure national security.

According to the plan, the next summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council will be held in 1990 in Doha, the capital of Qatar.
