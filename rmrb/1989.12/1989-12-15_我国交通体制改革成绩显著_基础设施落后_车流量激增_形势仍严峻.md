People's Daily, Beijing, December 14th.

The unified management of urban and rural road traffic by public security organs over the past three years has initially curbed the sharp rise in traffic accidents nationwide, but the situation facing road traffic management remains very severe.

Vice Minister of Public Security Yu Lei said at the national public security traffic management work conference held today that various levels of public security organs have carried out in-depth traffic safety propaganda, rectified the traffic environment, and strengthened legal construction, achieving remarkable results in traffic management work. Compared with the same period last year, from January to November this year, traffic accidents decreased by 6.44%, and the number of deaths decreased by 8.26%.

Yu Lei pointed out that due to the contradiction between the backward road infrastructure and the rapid increase in vehicle flow, the current situation facing traffic management in our country is still very severe.

It is reported that after rectification, the phenomena of threshing and drying grain, setting up stalls for business, and illegal constructions on roads, which have seriously hindered traffic safety and smoothness for many years, have been significantly reduced.

    我国交通体制改革成绩显著
    基础设施落后　车流量激增　形势仍严峻
    本报北京12月14日讯　记者何伟报道：公安机关统一管理城乡道路交通三年来，全国交通事故大幅度上升的势头初步得到遏制，但是公路交通管理面临的形势仍十分严峻。
    公安部副部长俞雷在今天召开的全国公安交通管理工作会议上说，各级公安机关深入开展交通安全宣传、治理交通环境，加强法制建设，取得了交通管理工作的显著成就。与去年同期相比，今年1至11月，交通事故减少6.44％，死亡人数减少8.26％。
    俞雷指出，由于道路基础设施落后与车辆流量急剧增长的矛盾日益尖锐，当前我国交通管理面临的形势仍然十分严峻。
    据悉，经过治理，多年来在公路上打场晒粮、摆摊经商、违章建筑等严重妨碍交通安全和畅通的现象大为减少。
