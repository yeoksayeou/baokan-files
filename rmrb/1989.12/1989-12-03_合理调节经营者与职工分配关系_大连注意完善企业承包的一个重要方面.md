How to properly handle the distribution relationship between enterprise managers and workers is an important aspect of improving enterprise contracting. Dalian City, adhering to the principle of both linking managers' wage income to the enterprise's economic performance and controlling excessive income, issued new management regulations for the wages of managers in contracted enterprises in early October.

The "regulations" stipulate that managers' wage income includes their standard wages, various bonuses, and various allowances and subsidies. The competent department of the enterprise must strictly follow the provisions of the contract management agreement, comprehensively assess the completion of various economic indicators and related clauses, and insist on rewarding and punishing accordingly. Managers' wage income must be truthfully reported to the workers' congress.

The "regulations" stipulate that if the manager fails to complete the contract requirements, the manager's annual standard wage and the enterprise's per capita bonus level will be deducted by a certain percentage for the manager and other members of the factory-level leadership team. If the manager completes the contract requirements for all indicators, the manager's annual wage income can be within one times the enterprise's annual per capita wage income; if the manager exceeds the contract requirements, the income can be between 1 to 1.5 times; if the main economic indicators reach the highest level in the city, province, or the same industry nationwide during the same period, the income can be between 1.5 to 2 times; if the manager makes outstanding contributions in product adjustment, foreign exchange earnings, technological transformation, and improving economic benefits, the income can exceed 2 times. If the annual per capita wage of enterprise workers does not increase or the increase is within 0.5%, the manager's wage income should be correspondingly deducted.

The annual wage income of the party secretary of large and medium-sized enterprises is equivalent to that of the manager, and the principle of rewarding and punishing together with the manager is adhered to. The annual wage income of the party branch secretary (branch) of small enterprises is determined according to the actual situation of the enterprise. The wage income of other members of the factory-level leadership team is controlled within 70% of the manager's wage income, and is determined by the manager according to their work performance and the size of their responsibilities.

The "regulations" also stipulate that the wages and various bonuses of managers and other members of the enterprise leadership team are managed and issued uniformly by the labor and personnel department of the enterprise, and they are not allowed to privately accept bonuses, rebates, and "red envelopes" from other channels, otherwise, they will be treated as disciplinary violations. The wage income of managers and other members of the factory-level leadership team is subject to the inspection and supervision of the same-level and higher-level party organizations, and the supervision of the masses, and must be approved by the workers' congress and reported to the relevant departments for approval after being recognized. Their legitimate income is protected by law, and personal income adjustment tax is paid according to legal provisions.

To strengthen the leadership and supervision of this work, Dalian City has established a management wage income approval leading group, and various districts (cities) and municipal competent bureaus have also established corresponding organizations.

    合理调节经营者与职工分配关系
    ——大连注意完善企业承包的一个重要方面
    刘镇源
    如何正确处理企业经营者与职工之间的分配关系，是完善企业承包的一个重要方面。大连市本着既坚持经营者的工资收入与企业经济效益挂钩，又控制其收入过高的原则，于10月初对实行承包经营的企业经营者的工资制定出新的管理办法。
    “办法”指出，经营者工资收入是指经营者的标准工资、各种奖金及各种津贴、补贴等。企业主管部门要严格按照承包经营合同规定，全面考核各项经济指标和有关条款的完成情况，坚持有奖有罚，经营者的工资收入要如实向职工代表大会报告。
    “办法”规定，凡未完成合同规定的经营者，按照本人年标准工资和本企业人均奖金水平扣发本人及厂级领导班子其他成员的一定比例的工资收入；凡完成合同规定的各项指标的经营者，其年工资收入可在本企业年人均工资收入的一倍以内；超额完成合同规定的可在1至1.5倍以内；主要经济指标达到市、省或国内同行业同期最高水平的，可在1.5至2倍内；在企业产品调整、出口创汇、技术改造、提高经济效益等方面做出突出贡献的可高于2倍。企业职工年人均工资没有增长或增长幅度在0.5％以内的，要相应扣减经营者应得的工资收入。
    大中型企业党委书记的年工资收入，相当于经营者的年工资收入，坚持与经营者同奖同罚。小型企业党总支（支部）书记的年工资收入，根据企业实际情况确定。企业厂级领导班子其他成员的工资收入，控制在经营者工资收入的70％以内，由经营者根据他们的工作实绩、责任大小自行确定。
    “办法”还规定，经营者及企业领导班子其他成员的工资和各种奖金，由企业劳资部门归口管理，统一发放，不得私自接受来自其它各种渠道的奖金、回扣和“红包”等，否则，按违纪处理。经营者及厂级领导班子其它成员的工资收入，要接受同级和上级党组织的检查监督，接受群众的监督，并经职工代表大会认可后，报有关部门审批。他们的正当收入受法律保护，按法律规定缴纳个人收入调节税。
    为加强对这项工作的领导和监督，大连市成立了经营者工资收入审批领导小组，各县（市）区和市主管局也成立了相应的组织机构。
