In recent days, Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology has organized various activities to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Mao Zedong's inscription "Serve the People Wholeheartedly" for the university.

Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology was established in 1947, originally as the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Telecommunications Engineering College. On November 27, 1949, Mao Zedong inscribed "Serve the People Wholeheartedly" for the school. On January 8, 1960, Mao Zedong inscribed "Hard Work and Simplicity" for the school again.

To educate all faculty, staff, and students to always remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "Serve the People Wholeheartedly" and "Hard Work and Simplicity," the university held a commemorative meeting, organized a school history exhibition, and decided to have all faculty and students raise funds and build a memorial monument to Chairman Mao's inscription on campus. The university also designated November as the inscription commemoration month.

    纪念毛泽东题词四十周年
    本报西安12月12日电　连日来，西安电子科技大学开展各种活动，纪念毛泽东同志为该校题词“全心全意为人民服务”40周年。
    西安电子科技大学创建于1947年，原为晋察冀军区电讯工程专科学校。1949年11月27日，毛泽东同志为该校题词“全心全意为人民服务”，1960年1月8日，毛泽东同志又一次为该校题词“艰苦朴素”。
    为了教育全校师生员工永远铭记毛主席
  “全心全意为人民服务”和“艰苦朴素”的教导，该校召开了纪念大会，举办了校史展览，并决定由全校师生集资，自己动手在校内建立毛主席题词纪念碑，并把每年11月定为题词纪念月。
