One inferno after another ruthlessly devours the precious lives and hard-earned property of the people.

From January to October this year, Hunan Province has experienced 312 fires, resulting in 64 deaths, 133 injuries, and direct economic losses of over 9.629 million yuan. Looking back, the fire situation each year is similar, if not worse.

The rampage of the fire demon is largely due to the lack of fire prevention awareness in society.

Many people's complacency has led to one fire after another. On the evening of October 10, a security guard at the Lushan Photo Studio on Changsha's Zhongshan Road was using an electric heater to boil water on the second floor and then went downstairs to read, forgetting about it and falling asleep. As a result, the electric heater dried up the water and caused a fire, resulting in direct economic losses of over 4 million yuan. On April 19, the Hongjiang Textile Mill had a fire causing losses of over 1.4 million yuan. On June 23, a temporary worker threw a cigarette butt into the raw cotton, leading to the burning of the warehouse, causing losses of over 2.2 million yuan.

Individual complacency is closely linked to the lack of collective fire prevention awareness. In recent years, after implementing the economic responsibility system, some enterprises and units have focused solely on immediate economic benefits, neglecting fire safety, often taking risks, and not even providing basic fire-fighting equipment. Daoxian County's Daozhou Down Feathers Factory is a key fire prevention unit, but in recent years, it has had multiple fire alarms, yet the factory still lacks fire-fighting equipment and an alarm phone. On October 13, some workers packed and stacked the down feathers without allowing them to cool down after drying, leading to a fire. Due to the lack of fire-fighting equipment, it was difficult to extinguish the fire, and reporting the fire required calling from another unit. By the time the fire truck arrived, property worth over 1.4 million yuan had turned to ashes.

The lack of fire prevention awareness among some unit leaders is a significant factor in the collective lack of fire prevention awareness. Many places have seen strange occurrences: buying a small car worth tens of thousands of yuan is easy, but buying a fire truck worth a few hundred thousand yuan is difficult; some counties have plenty of fuel for numerous large and small vehicles, but there is no guarantee for one or two fire trucks; some units can spend tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or even over a thousand million yuan on building high-rise buildings, fearing they won't be luxurious enough, but when it comes to fire-fighting equipment, they either don't include it in the construction plan or just add a bit, unwilling to spend the money; many government agencies have surplus personnel, but the local fire-fighting front is always short of personnel, and the province still has 37 counties without even a fire-fighting squad. The consequences of this are predictable. On November 27 last year, the food company building in Shaodong County caught fire. Since the county had neither a fire-fighting squad nor a fire truck, it had to seek help from the fire-fighting team in Shaoyang City, 30 kilometers away. After the fire-fighting team arrived, the local water pipes initially had insufficient water pressure, and then when the pressure was increased, the water pipes burst. The opportunity to extinguish the fire was repeatedly missed, and the fire loss reached 6.1 million yuan.

On one hand, there is a lack of fire prevention awareness, and on the other hand, the fire prevention tasks are increasing. With the development of economic construction, enterprises are becoming more numerous, construction groups are springing up everywhere, the power grid is expanding, and household appliances and motor vehicles are increasing rapidly... All of this poses new challenges for fire safety work. How to prevent fires? How to extinguish them? There are issues with personnel and equipment, with funds and technology, but we believe that the most pressing issue at the moment is how to enhance the fire prevention awareness of the entire population and truly achieve the goal of preventing disasters before they "burn"!

### 防患于未“燃”——社会防火意识透视

    防患于未“燃”
    ——社会防火意识透视
    一场场熊熊大火，残酷无情地吞噬着人民宝贵的生命和来之不易的财产。
    今年1—10月，湖南省已发生火灾312次，烧死64人，烧伤133人，造成直接经济损失962.9万多元。由此上溯，每年火灾情况相差无几甚至更为严重。
    火魔肆虐，社会防火意识淡薄是个重要原因。
    不少人的麻痹大意，导致了一场场大火。10月10日晚上，长沙市中山路庐山照相馆一名值班员在二楼用电炉烧水，而后下到一楼看书，竟忘却此事熟睡。结果电炉把水烧干后引起大火，造成直接经济损失40多万元。洪江市纺织厂在4月19日起火损失14万多元之后，6月23日，一名临时工将烟头丢进原麻里，导致仓库被焚，损失达22万多元。
    个人麻痹大意，与群体防火意识淡薄紧密相联。这些年实行经济承包责任制以后，一些企业单位只顾眼前经济利益，不重防火安全，往往冒险作业，连起码的消防设施都不添置。道县道州羽绒厂本是重点防火单位，近年多次发生火警，但厂里仍无消防设施，无报警电话。今年10月13日，一些职工将羽绒烘干后不待散热就装包码堆，导致起火。起火后因无消防设施难以扑救，连报警也要到外单位打电话。等到消防车赶到，价值14万多元的财产化为灰烬。
    一些单位领导缺乏防火意识，是群体消防意识淡薄的重要因素。不少地方出现了这样的怪事：十几二十几万元一辆的小轿车说买就买，而买几万元一辆的消防车却拿不出钱；有的县市众多大小车辆用油有富余，一二辆消防车却无保障；有的单位修建高楼大厦可花几十万、几百万乃至上千万元，唯恐不豪华，配消防设施要么未纳入施工计划，要么稍事点缀，不愿破费；不少机关单位人浮于事，当地消防战线却老是缺编，全省至今还有37个县连消防中队也没建……由此造成的后果可想而知。去年11月27日，邵东县副食品公司大楼起火，由于县里既无消防中队，又无消防车，只得向相距30公里远的邵阳市消防队求援。消防队赶到后，当地水管里起先水压不足，后一加压，水管又破裂。灭火机会一再错过，火灾损失达61万元。
    一方面是防火意识的淡薄，一方面却是防火任务的加重。随着经济建设的发展，企业越来越多，建筑群遍地开花，电网不断扩展，家用电器和机动车辆迅猛增加……这一切，给防火安全工作提出了一个个新的课题。怎样防火？如何灭火？有人员、设备问题，有资金、技术问题，但我们认为，当前摆在第一位的还是如何增强全民的防火意识，真正做到防患于未“燃”！
