Famous Chinese Go player Chen Zude, a nine-dan, returned to the competition stage after a nine-year absence today in his hometown of Jiading County, Shanghai. He played a rapid game against Liu Xiaoguang, also a nine-dan.

Shanghai Television broadcast the rapid game live.

After two hours of intense play, Chen Zude, whose skills remained sharp, defeated Liu Xiaoguang. When Chen Zude met with the audience, he appeared very excited and moved. He joyfully said, "I can play Go again!"

Chen Zude's eyes welled up with tears as he spoke. "Today's win or loss is not the most important thing," he said. "Perhaps Liu Xiaoguang saw the special concern and support from the people of his hometown for my return to the game and wanted to help me win. Perhaps he held back a bit to avoid discouraging me. Liu Xiaoguang is one of China's top players, and he did not give his all."

Chen Zude's remarks elicited laughter from the entire audience.

The rapid game was specially arranged by the Jiading County Go Association for Chen Zude's return.

Chen Zude expressed his gratitude to the people of his hometown, saying, "As soon as I picked up the black and white stones, I felt an indescribable joy. I am a Go player, and I love to play. From the bottom of my heart, I thank the people of my hometown for arranging this game for me. From the bottom of my heart, I thank the audience for their concern and support. From the bottom of my heart, I thank Shanghai Television for the live broadcast."

    陈祖德重返围棋赛场
    新华社上海十二月二十六日电　（记者谭军）我国著名围棋九段陈祖德阔别赛场九年后，今天在故乡上海嘉定县复出，与刘小光九段进行了一场快棋赛。
    上海电视台直播了这场快棋赛。
    经过两个小时的奋战，陈祖德宝刀未老，战胜了刘小光。当陈祖德与观众见面时，他显得非常激动和兴奋。他高兴地说：“我又能下棋了！”陈祖德两眼含着晶莹的泪花，他说：“今天的胜负不是主要的，也许是刘小光看到家乡人民对我重新下棋表示特别的关心并希望我赢；也许是为了不打击我的积极性而手下留情了，刘小光是我国超一流棋手，他没有全力以赴。”陈祖德一席话，说得全场一片笑声。
    这场快棋赛是嘉定县围棋协会特意为陈祖德复出而安排的。
    陈祖德对在坐的家乡人民连声道谢，他说：“我一拿起黑白子，心里有说不出的喜悦，我是棋手，我爱下棋。我从心底里感谢家乡人民为我安排的这场棋赛，我从心底里感谢观众对我的关怀和支持，我从心底里感谢上海电视台的直播。”
