The foreign military attachés corps in Beijing held an annual banquet this evening. State Councilor and Minister of National Defense Qin Jiwei attended.

The corps commander, Colonel Munda, gave the first toast. He said that the relationship between the military attachés corps and the People's Liberation Army has continued to strengthen over the years. Undoubtedly, this relationship benefits from China's policy of opening up to the outside world. We are very proud to maintain such a relationship with the People's Liberation Army and firmly believe that enhancing understanding between the armed forces of our countries and the Chinese military is a positive factor in the effort to achieve world peace.

Munda said, "We hope to see a strong and prosperous China that will help stabilize the regional situation, maintain world peace, and promote international understanding."

Major General Song Wenzhong, Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, gave a toast. He said that the People's Liberation Army firmly implements the foreign policies of the Chinese government, hopes to develop friendship and cooperation with the armed forces of all countries, and makes unremitting efforts to oppose hegemony and maintain world peace. He said, "We are pleased to see that over the past years, China has established good relations and conducted fruitful cooperation with the armed forces of many countries. We also believe that this friendly cooperative relationship will make new progress in the future."

He expressed his thanks to the many military attachés who have worked hard over the past year to develop friendly cooperative relations with the Chinese military.
