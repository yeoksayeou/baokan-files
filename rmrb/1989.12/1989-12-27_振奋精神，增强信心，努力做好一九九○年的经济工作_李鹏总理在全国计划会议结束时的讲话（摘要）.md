The upcoming issue of the magazine "Seeking Truth" (Qiu Shi) in 1990 will publish in full the speech given by Premier Li Peng on December 11, 1989, at the conclusion of the National Planning Conference. The title of the speech is "Revitalize the Spirit, Strengthen Confidence, and Strive to Do a Good Job in Economic Work for 1990." The following is a summary:

I will focus on three main points.

First, further unifying thoughts and actions with the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee comprehensively analyzed the current economic situation in China, and made the decision to further advance rectification and deepen reforms. Over the past two months, through the dissemination and study of the documents from the Fifth Plenary Session, the awareness of the importance of rectification among leading cadres at all levels has significantly improved. Generally, it is believed that implementing the Central Committee's "Decision" is the correct path to overcoming economic difficulties and achieving sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. Various regions and departments are currently implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session in accordance with their actual situations. This is the important ideological foundation for doing a good job in economic work in 1990.

Through more than a year of hard work, rectification and deepening reforms have made noticeable progress nationwide, and the overall economic situation is improving. This is evident in the following ways: the continuous overheating of the economy over the past few years has cooled down; the excessively high industrial growth rates of previous years, when viewed nationwide and for the entire year of 1989, have been reduced to a more reasonable level; agricultural production has achieved good results; the momentum of expanding investment and consumption demand has slowed; the scale of bank loans and currency issuance has been effectively controlled, and urban and rural residents' savings have increased significantly; the monthly increase in retail prices has decreased, and some commodity prices have even stabilized or decreased, alleviating the public's anxiety about price increases. These facts prove that the series of rectification measures focused on controlling demand and adjusting structure, adopted by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, have already, are, and will continue to play a positive role.

We must neither underestimate nor overestimate the initial achievements of rectification. It must be recognized that the fundamental factors causing inflation have not been eliminated, and deep-seated problems affecting economic stability, such as the total social demand exceeding total social supply and irrational industrial structure, have not been fundamentally resolved. In the process of solving existing problems, new contradictions have emerged. The main issues are: market sales have been sluggish in recent months, although the amount of funds issued is not small, local governments and enterprises still feel tight; the decline in industrial growth has been too rapid, and the number of unemployed has increased. The economic situation can be described as having both positive and negative aspects. Although the national economy is generally moving towards a virtuous cycle, it should be noted that rectification has entered a very arduous stage.

1990 is a crucial year for rectification and deepening reforms. This is because: first, 1990 is a year when various difficulties are concentrated, with domestic debt entering a peak repayment period and foreign debt repayment and interest payments also increasing. Before industrial efficiency significantly improves, the decline in industrial growth will affect fiscal revenue, and there are other factors increasing expenditures and reducing revenues. Second, the situation where long-standing problems and newly emerged contradictions coexist will likely continue in 1990, which will increase the complexity and difficulty of rectification. Third, 1990 is a turning point for rectification. Whether China's economy can truly achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development in the future depends on whether we can, under the premise of controlling social total demand, significantly improve the economic structure and efficiency. Adjusting the structure and improving efficiency will be much more difficult than controlling demand and reducing speed. However, this hurdle must be overcome; otherwise, not only will the long-standing contradiction of total social demand exceeding total social supply be difficult to alleviate, but newly emerged contradictions will also be difficult to resolve. In this sense, China's rectification has entered a critical stage in 1990. The economy is the foundation, and politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. Doing a good job in economic work in 1990 is crucial for stabilizing the overall economic situation, maintaining political stability, and social order. If economic work is done well, it will be possible to advance rectification and deepening reforms, gradually turning passive situations into active ones.

In facing the difficulties of rectification, we have two choices. One is to retreat in the face of difficulties, stop rectification, and abandon the "tight" policies. The other is to advance in the face of difficulties, steadfastly push forward with rectification, while studying new situations, overcoming new difficulties, and solving new problems, thereby steadily advancing economic work. The first choice will not only fail to resolve the problems that have already emerged but will also lead to continued inflation, further deterioration of the economic structure, and greater economic disorder. The second choice requires hard work, paying a certain price, enduring considerable pain, and going through a difficult period. However, economic instability will gradually be eliminated, and the economy will emerge from the predicament, eventually achieving a virtuous cycle. We must learn from historical lessons and avoid repeating the vicious cycle of "tightening leads to complaints, complaints lead to relaxation, and relaxation leads to inflation."

We must see the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties. Over the past 10 years of construction and reform, we have achieved tremendous successes. The country's economic strength has significantly increased, urban and rural living standards have improved, and various sectors have great potential. Whether difficulties can be overcome depends on the spiritual state, especially the spiritual state of leading cadres at all levels, and whether they can lead the masses to actively and proactively overcome difficulties and do a good job. We must use the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session to unify thoughts and actions, face difficulties, revitalize the spirit, and work hard to overcome current difficulties.

Second, key tasks for 1990.

The tasks for economic work in 1990 are complex and arduous. The general guiding ideology is to, under the premise of maintaining social stability, advance towards the goals of rectification and deepening reforms set by the Central Committee, as outlined in the Fifth Plenary Session. In various plans and economic work, we must reflect the requirement of truly tightening our belts for a few years and pay attention to comprehensive planning, foresight, and hindsight. During the rectification period, reforms should be carried out around rectification, and on the basis of maintaining policy stability and continuity, various reform measures should be enriched and improved to serve the goals of rectification. Party committees and governments at all levels must handle these relationships, properly arrange work in various aspects, grasp the strength and timing of rectification and deepening reform measures, and ensure that they can be understood and supported by the masses. Based on the current situation, the following key tasks should be focused on in 1990:

1. Strengthen agriculture and strive for a good harvest of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. This is crucial for stabilizing the overall economy. To improve agriculture, we must seriously implement the various policies and measures determined by the Central Committee to strengthen agriculture. In 1990, both the central and local governments should increase investment in agriculture. The state plan has decided to increase investment in agriculture and ensure reliable funding sources. Improving agriculture is a matter for the entire Party and the nation. We hope that local governments at all levels will squeeze out as much funding as possible for agriculture, which should be larger than the proportion arranged by the central government.

The monopoly management of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films for agricultural production has achieved good results and should be continued. Local governments should prioritize agricultural industrial resources in terms of energy, transportation, and funds, and strive to maintain stable prices. The state will maintain the quantity and price stability of fertilizers and diesel for grain contract procurement. The State Council has decided on "Science and Technology for Agriculture," and the key now is implementation. Governments at all levels should mobilize and organize agricultural science and technology personnel to go to the countryside. For the funds and materials needed for "Science and Technology for Agriculture," strong support should be provided. The household contract responsibility system in rural areas should be further stabilized and improved, and various forms of agricultural service systems should be developed to gradually establish and improve a dual-management system. This approach can stabilize the enthusiasm of farmers while leveraging the advantages of collective economies. In areas with conditions, on a voluntary basis, moderate-scale operations can be developed. Township and village governments should seriously organize and lead collective economies and various service systems, while collective economies should be the foundation for consolidating township and village governments. In accordance with the principles of adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement, we should actively guide the healthy development of township enterprises. The role of township enterprises should be affirmed. They are an important economic form for developing rural economies, improving agricultural production conditions, and increasing employment in rural areas. Unhealthy practices in township enterprises should be corrected and overcome, while the positive aspects should be protected and supported. The key is to guide township enterprises to implement national industrial policies, improve product quality, reduce material consumption, and meet market needs. In 1990, banks at all levels should provide appropriate support for the working capital of township enterprises.

Developing agriculture is not just the responsibility of the agricultural sector but a task for the entire Party, the nation, and all sectors. The entire nation, all industries, should mobilize to support agriculture and work together to achieve a better harvest in 1990 than in 1989, striving to end the stagnation of agriculture over the past few years.

2. Take active measures from all aspects to maintain a moderate growth in industrial production. The purpose of rectification is to reduce excessively high industrial growth rates while striving to maintain a reasonable growth rate. Excessively high growth is not good, but excessively low growth is also not good. From the central to local governments, strong measures must be taken to strengthen organizational leadership and solve the difficulties and problems facing industrial production, so that production can gradually recover and develop stably. Our goal is for industrial output value in 1990 to grow by 6% compared to 1989, and for the national income to grow by 5%. In the future, we should gradually increase the national income by an average of 6% per year on the basis of adjusting the structure and improving efficiency, so that by the end of the century, the national income can double again, and people's living standards can reach a moderately prosperous level, achieving the second strategic goal of China's socialist modernization.

To achieve good industrial production in 1990, the following measures should be taken:

First, we must do everything possible to activate circulation and ensure smooth flow of goods. The commercial, material, supply and marketing, and foreign trade sectors should actively purchase marketable and high-quality branded products, fully leveraging the main channels and "reservoir" role of state-owned commerce. Banks should appropriately increase loans for purchasing funds for these sectors. The commercial, material, supply and marketing, and foreign trade sectors should actively explore markets, adopt various methods to promote goods, especially to adopt multiple channels to deliver goods to rural areas, develop rural markets, and strive to increase the circulation of currency and goods. Our country is a large country with 11 billion people and over 800 million farmers. In recent years, urban and rural residents' incomes have grown rapidly, and with the development of production, incomes will continue to grow. China's market is very vast, and we should strive to develop it.

Second, we must focus on adjusting product structure and improving economic efficiency in industrial production. One important reason for the current sluggish market sales is that products are not marketable and of poor quality. Currently, stores have unsold goods that are of poor quality, high price, outdated style, and oversupply; while new, affordable, and high-quality goods are still in short supply and remain popular. Industrial enterprises, especially those producing consumer goods, should learn to use and adapt to market regulation laws, organize production based on changes in domestic and international market demand, timely adjust product structure, increase varieties, and improve product quality. We practice a planned economy combined with market regulation, and here we should play the role of market regulation. The light industry and machinery sectors should use the opportunity of adjustment to actively develop new products, increase export products and products that can replace imports, and create more foreign exchange and save foreign exchange for the country. To further motivate the enthusiasm and initiative of enterprises and employees, the enterprise contract responsibility system should continue, and practical experience should be summarized, improved, and continuously improved.

To cope with the upcoming peak period of foreign debt repayment, it is necessary to reduce imports and increase foreign exchange reserves. This is a matter of China's credibility in the world and a matter of national independence. In 1990, more stringent restrictions should be implemented on imported goods. In principle, goods that can be produced domestically and have quality and performance that can replace imported products should be controlled or restricted. This does not contradict our policy of opening up to the outside world. Our purpose of introducing advanced technology is to enhance self-reliance, not to rely on foreign countries for a long time. Over the past 10 years, we have introduced a large number of advanced foreign technologies, and now is the time for them to bear fruit. At the same time, we should continue to introduce advanced foreign technologies, patents, and samples, and digest and absorb them to achieve localization. We must develop new products, reduce consumption, improve efficiency, and enterprises must strengthen technological transformation and improve management levels. Technological transformation requires investment, but the main body of investment is the enterprise, which must rely on its own potential to use limited funds for technological transformation. Governments at all levels should also provide appropriate support, and banks should appropriately increase the quota for technological transformation loans. Opening up to the outside world is a policy that China must adhere to for a long time. We should make full use of favorable factors in the international situation, actively expand opening up, and make opening up and rectification promote each other. We should continue to effectively utilize foreign capital and advanced technology, further improve the investment environment, manage "three-in-one" enterprises well, and strive to attract more direct foreign investment according to industrial policies. We should further develop economic and technological development zones, continue to advocate and encourage coastal regions to develop export-oriented economies. The basic policies and measures for economic and technological development zones and coastal open areas will not change and should be gradually improved in practice.

Third, we must seriously implement national industrial policies. We should take various effective measures to ensure that the production of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises with low material consumption and good economic efficiency, which are related to the national economy and people's livelihood, is maintained as much as possible. For small and medium-sized industrial enterprises producing daily necessities, protective policies should also be implemented. From the central to local governments, a list of enterprises that must be protected should be sorted out by industry and region, and preferential policies should be implemented in bank loans, energy, raw material supply, and transportation.

Fourth, we must strengthen the planned management of important production materials. We should emphasize the seriousness of mandatory plans. We should appropriately increase the proportion of certain important scarce materials allocated by the state to ensure the needs of key national production and construction.

Fifth, we must do a good job in organizing and coordinating industrial production. In the current situation, the external environment of enterprises has changed greatly. Local governments and enterprises will encounter unexpected difficulties and problems at any time. To maintain the continuity and normal operation of production, we must strengthen macro-management. The State Council should further strengthen the organization and coordination of national industrial production, and provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should also strengthen the organization and coordination of industrial production according to their own situations.

Actively explore production, diversified operations, and service channels, and strive to arrange for unemployed workers. During the rectification period, with the compression of investment scale and adjustment of industrial structure, some enterprises are currently in a state of suspension or semi-suspension, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing, which is difficult to completely avoid. How to properly arrange for unemployed workers requires high attention. From the central to local governments, we must strengthen leadership, make detailed arrangements, and seriously do a good job for unemployed workers. We must explain to everyone that our difficulties are temporary, and we must see the light in difficult times and strengthen our confidence in overcoming difficulties. Trade unions at all levels work under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. On the one hand, they should reflect the actual difficulties of workers, and on the other hand, they should guide workers to consider the overall situation and help the Party and government to overcome difficulties together.

We must strengthen the organization and management of suspended and unemployed workers, mobilize them to engage in various beneficial activities within the factory, such as equipment maintenance, warehouse cleaning, factory environment improvement, and organizing various studies and technical training, and not push them out into society. We must ensure the basic living needs of suspended and unemployed workers, and issue appropriate wages or living allowances according to different situations.

Actively explore the production field, increase new employment opportunities in urban and rural areas, and reduce the number of unemployed workers. In cities, we should organize various social services, increase commercial outlets, and open up various employment channels. At the same time, we should organize people returning from cities to the countryside to participate in water conservancy projects, afforestation, bridge and road construction, and development-oriented agriculture. To open up employment channels, develop social production, we should continue to adhere to the public ownership system as the mainstay and develop multiple economic components. Individual and private economies are beneficial and necessary supplements to the socialist economy. We should strengthen management and guidance for them, encourage them to develop within the scope allowed by the state, and play their positive role in developing production, convenience in life, and expanding employment, while limiting their negative impact on the development of the socialist economy.

To reduce the pressure of urban employment, we must strictly control the number of employees and the conversion of agricultural population to non-agricultural population in the next few years. At the same time, we should use this opportunity to gradually establish a social insurance and social security system.

Strictly strengthen market price management and control the price increase rate. Reducing the inflation rate and price increase rate year by year is a basic task of rectification. Achieving the task of controlling the price increase rate in 1990 is very arduous. Continuing to control social total demand is the fundamental measure to control price increases. We must strictly control the arbitrary price increases by departments and enterprises. For the prices of basic necessities of life and labor services, we should adopt a basic stability policy, and some basic necessities of life should be clearly stipulated not to increase in price. We must seriously clean up various charging standards, strictly prohibit and prohibit arbitrary price increases and arbitrary charges. We must strengthen market price management, strengthen price supervision and inspection, especially give full play to the role of the masses and public opinion in supervising prices. We should continue to implement the price control target responsibility system. In 1990, we should still take the control of the price increase rate as an important content for evaluating the work of governments at all levels.

We must adhere to the tight policy and truly tighten our belts for a few years. This is an extremely important link to overcome financial and economic difficulties and alleviate various contradictions. Now everyone agrees to tighten our belts for a few years, but currently, many places, departments, and units still do not have the atmosphere and sense of urgency to truly tighten their belts. The problems of expanding investment scale and rapid growth of consumption demand have not been fundamentally solved, and in some places, the large fiscal expenditures have not been reduced, and the phenomena of waste and extravagance in production, construction, circulation, and other fields are still quite serious. If we do not make up our minds to change this situation, it will be difficult to eliminate inflation, and our economy will not be able to move towards sustained, stable, and coordinated development. In 1990, we must continue to control social total demand and adhere to the policy of tight fiscal and credit. This point must not be shaken; otherwise, the initial achievements of rectification and deepening reforms will be lost. This requires that from top to bottom, all aspects must fully reflect the requirement of tightening our belts when thinking about and doing things. In construction, we must control the scale of fixed asset investment within the planned level and not exceed it. Local governments should not expand the scale of self-raised funds. We must further compress the scale of non-operating investments and continue to do a good job in cleaning up ongoing projects, strictly controlling new projects. At the same time, we must further adjust the investment structure. In terms of the approval authority for basic construction projects, the authority delegated by the central government to the provinces will not change, but the central government will regulate the investment scale and guide the investment direction according to industrial policies. The approval authority for projects delegated by the provinces should be appropriately centralized at the provincial level. In terms of consumption, the growth rate of workers' income must be lower than the growth rate of national income and labor productivity. In 1989, significant achievements were made in controlling social purchasing power, and in 1990, we must continue to strictly control it. In terms of fiscal expenditures, we must make up our minds to reduce the various expenditure items that were raised during the economic overheating period, and administrative and public institutions must tighten their belts, and enterprises must also tighten their belts. The central government's fiscal contract system with local governments will not change. At the same time, to gradually increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in the total fiscal revenue, in terms of credit, we must continue to control the scale of loans and currency issuance and not exceed the planned control indicators. We must continue to play the important role of finance in macro-control. Savings and deposits have played a significant role in stabilizing the market and finance, and we should continue to implement them and encourage and advocate for urban and rural residents to actively participate in savings for the country and for themselves. Financial departments should pay attention to timely adjustments, strengthen classified guidance, adjust the credit structure, and do a better job in the issuance and management of loans.

All localities and industries must oppose various forms of waste and extravagance, advocate thrift, and manage all affairs frugally. In the current situation, only by making up our minds to truly tighten our belts, including the central and local governments, the state and enterprises, can everyone get through.

Third, strengthen the overall concept, seriously transform the style of work, and implement various tasks.

The major policies for economic work in 1990 have been determined, and the key is to grasp the implementation.

We must strengthen the overall concept and organizational discipline. Rectification will inevitably require necessary adjustments to the existing interest pattern. Implementing the 1990 plan, increasing the proportion of some provinces and municipalities remitting to the central fiscal revenue, reducing fiscal subsidies for some regions, appropriately increasing the proportion of important materials allocated by the state, continuing to compress the investment scale, and adjusting the investment structure, etc., will all directly or indirectly affect the interests of local governments and departments. Now the central government has difficulties, and local governments also have difficulties, but the central government's difficulties are greater, and moreover, the central government's difficulties are difficulties that affect the overall situation. The measures taken now are all formulated on the premise of balancing the interests of the central and local governments. We hope that everyone will start from the overall interests and make more contributions to the country. In recent years, local interests have been emphasized too much, and overall interests have been emphasized too little, and the national and overall concepts have become weak. This trend must be changed. We must understand that China is a unified country, and China's economy is a unified economy. Economic work, like other work, must adhere to the principle of democratic centralism. Before the Party Central Committee and the State Council make major economic decisions, they must consult with local governments, fully listen to local opinions, and strive to gather wisdom and make decisions that are practical and have high scientificity. Once a decision is made, local governments and departments must do their best to implement it, without reducing it or acting arbitrarily. In the future, whether to consciously maintain the overall interests, national interests, and Party interests, and whether to seriously implement national policies and plans, should be an important standard for evaluating leading cadres.

We must improve the style of leadership, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, study and solve problems. We must carry out extensive investigations and research, advocate that leading cadres go deep into reality, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, study new situations, solve new problems, timely summarize experiences, and correct work deviations. Leading organs should organize cadres to go to the front line of production and construction in a planned way, and solve practical difficulties in work together with grassroots cadres. This is also an important way to cultivate and temper cadres.

We must strengthen the sense of responsibility, improve the responsibility system, each doing their own job, and each fulfilling their responsibilities. The period of economic difficulties is a test for leading organs and leading cadres at all levels. The more difficulties there are, the more leading organs and leading cadres need to actively and proactively take responsibility, think of ways to overcome difficulties, and do a good job. The various tasks and measures of rectification and deepening reforms should be implemented by the departments responsible for them; problems that should be solved by a certain level should be solved by that level. We must not shift responsibilities and pass the buck. All departments and localities must dare to work boldly, take responsibility, and not wait and see. The State Council will regularly supervise and inspect the implementation of the Central Committee's "Decision" by various departments and regions.

We must further strengthen ideological and political work, unite and rely on the masses to complete various tasks. Doing a good job in economic work must be guaranteed by strong ideological and political work. The more difficulties there are, the more we must strengthen ideological and political work. Now, economic and social contradictions are relatively complex, and there are many ideological problems, which urgently require targeted ideological education. We must tell the masses about the difficulties and problems in the economy, as well as the solutions and bright future, to win the understanding and support of the masses, so as to mobilize and inspire the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals to work together, strive hard, and make more contributions to completing the 1990 economic plan and various tasks. In enterprises, we must continue to implement and improve the factory director responsibility system, ensure that the factory director independently and responsibly exercises the powers of production and management, technical development, etc., and at the same time, strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the enterprise party organization, and strengthen and improve ideological and political work. Factory directors and party secretaries must support and cooperate with each other, work together to manage the enterprise well, and lead the masses to overcome difficulties together.

Doing a good job in economic work in 1990 is of great significance. We believe that as long as the entire country seriously implements the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, works together, and strives hard, we will definitely be able to overcome various temporary difficulties and achieve new progress in economic work in 1990, continuing to move forward on the path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

    振奋精神，增强信心，努力做好一九九○年的经济工作
    李鹏总理在全国计划会议结束时的讲话（摘要）
    新华社北京12月26日电  即将出版的《求是》杂志1990年第1期全文发表了李鹏总理1989年12月11日在全国计划会议结束时的讲话，题目是《振奋精神，增强信心，努力做好1990年的经济工作》，摘要如下：
    我着重讲三个问题。
    一、进一步用十三届五中全会精神统一思想和统一行动
    党的十三届五中全会，全面分析了我国当前的经济形势，作出了进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定。近两个月来，经过传达、学习五中全会的文件，各级领导干部对治理整顿重要性的认识，有了很大的提高。普遍认为，贯彻中央的《决定》，是克服经济困难，实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展的正确途径。各地区、各部门正在结合实际情况，落实五中全会精神。这是做好1990年经济工作的重要思想基础。
    经过一年多来的努力工作，治理整顿和深化改革在全国范围内取得了比较明显的进展，整个经济情况正在向好的方向发展。突出表现在：连续几年的经济过热已经降温；前些年持续过高的工业增长速度，就全国和1989年全年来看，已经降到比较合理的水平；农业生产获得较好收成；投资需求和消费需求膨胀的势头有所减缓；银行贷款规模和货币投放得到有效控制，城乡居民储蓄有了较大的增长；零售物价上涨幅度逐月降低，一些商品的价格甚至稳中有降，广大群众对涨价的紧张心理已基本消除。这些事实都证明，党中央、国务院采取的以控制需求、调整结构为重点的一系列治理整顿措施，已经、正在并将继续发挥积极作用。
    对治理整顿所取得的初步成效，既不能估计不足，也不能估计过高。必须看到，导致通货膨胀的一些基本因素并没有消除，影响经济稳定的一些深层次问题，比如社会总需求大于社会总供给、产业结构不合理等，还没有从根本上得到解决。在解决原有问题的过程中，又出现了一些新的矛盾。主要是，近几个月来市场销售疲软，资金虽然投放量已不少，但各地和企业仍感到紧张，工业速度回落过猛，待业人员增多等。经济形势可以说是有喜有忧，喜忧并存。国民经济虽然总的是向良性循环方向发展，但应当指出，治理整顿正进入一个十分艰巨的阶段。
    1990年是治理整顿和深化改革的关键性一年。这是因为：第一，1990年是各方面困难比较集中的一年，内债将进入还债高峰，外债还本付息额也有所增加。在企业经济效益尚未有较大提高以前，工业速度的回落会影响财政收入，财政还有其他增支减收的因素。第二，多年积累的问题和新出现的矛盾交织在一起的情况，1990年将可能继续存在，这会增加治理整顿的复杂性和难度。第三，1990年是治理整顿的转折关头。我国经济今后能否真正实现持续、稳定、协调发展，根本的问题是能否在坚持压缩社会总需求的前提下，使经济结构有明显的改善，经济效益有明显的提高。调整结构和提高效益，要比压缩需求、降低速度困难得多。而这一关又非过不可，不然的话，不仅多年积累的社会总需求大于社会总供给的矛盾难以缓解，而且新出现的一些矛盾也都解决不了。从这个意义上说，我国的治理整顿在1990年进入了攻坚的阶段。经济是基础，政治是经济的集中表现。做好1990年的经济工作，对于稳定经济全局，保持政治稳定和社会安定，都是至关重要的。经济工作做好了，就可以把治理整顿和深化改革向前推进一步，整个经济工作就有可能逐步变被动为主动。
    对待治理整顿所面临的困难，摆在我们面前有两种不同的选择。一种是，知难而退，把治理整顿停下来，放弃“双紧”政策。另一种是，知难而进，坚定不移地推进治理整顿，同时，注意研究新的情况、克服新的困难、解决新的问题，从而把经济工作稳步推向前进。前一种选择，不仅现在已出现的问题得不到解决，而且通货膨胀还会继续发展，经济结构会进一步恶化，经济秩序会更加混乱。后一种选择，需要做艰苦的工作，付出一定的代价，忍受相当的痛苦，经历一段困难的过程。但是，经济中的不稳定因素会逐步消除，整个经济会从困境中走出来，进而实现良性循环。我们一定要汲取历史的经验教训，不能再重复那种“一紧就叫，一叫就松，一松又胀”的恶性循环了。
    我们要看到克服困难的有利条件。经过这10年来的建设和改革，我们取得了巨大的成就。国家经济实力显著增强，城乡人民生活明显改善，各个方面蕴藏着很大的潜力。困难是否能够克服，关键在于精神状态，特别是要看各级领导干部的精神状态如何，能否带领广大人民群众积极主动地克服困难，做好工作。我们必须用五中全会的精神，统一思想，统一行动，既正视困难，又振奋精神，扎扎实实地做好工作，战胜当前的困难。
    二、1990年要着重抓好的几项工作
    1990年经济工作的任务是复杂的和艰巨的。总的指导思想是，按照十三届五中全会的精神，在保持社会稳定的前提下，向中央确定的治理整顿、深化改革的目标前进一步。在各项计划和经济工作中，要体现真正过几年紧日子的要求，并注意统筹兼顾，瞻前顾后。在治理整顿期间，改革要围绕治理整顿来进行，要在保持政策稳定性、连续性的基础上，对各项改革措施进行充实和完善，为实现治理整顿的目标服务。各级党委和政府必须处理好这些关系，妥善安排各方面的工作，把握好治理整顿、深化改革措施的力度和选择好出台的有利时机，使之能得到广大人民群众的充分理解和支持。从当前情况看，1990年要着重抓好以下几项关键性工作。
    切实加强农业，力争粮食、棉花等主要农产品有一个好收成。这对于稳定经济全局有着决定性的意义。搞好农业，必须认真落实中央确定的加强农业的各项政策和措施。1990年从中央到地方都要增加对农业的投入。国家计划已决定增加对农业的投资，并保证有可靠的资金来源。办好农业是全党全民的大事，希望各级地方政府要尽量多挤出一些资金用于农业，应该比中央安排的比例大一些。
    化肥、农药、农膜等农业生产资料的专营工作，已取得较好的效果，要坚持下去。各地要对农用工业，在能源、交通、资金上给予优先保证，并努力保持价格的稳定。国家用于粮食合同定购的化肥、柴油，在数量上不变，在价格上也保持稳定。国务院已作出“科技兴农”的决定，现在的关键在于执行。各级政府要动员和组织农业科技人员下乡。对于“科技兴农”所需的资金、物资，要给予大力支持。要进一步稳定和完善农村家庭联产承包责任制和发展各种形式的农业服务体系，逐步建立健全双层经营体制，这样做既能稳定农民的积极性，又可以发挥集体经济的优越性。在有条件的地方，在农民自愿的基础上，可以发展适度规模经营。乡、村政权要认真组织和领导集体经济和各种服务体系，而集体经济应当成为巩固乡、村政权的基础。认真按照调整、整顿、改造、提高的方针，积极引导乡镇企业健康发展。对乡镇企业的作用要予以肯定。它们是发展农村经济，改善农业生产条件，增加农村人口就业的一个重要经济形式。对乡镇企业某些不健康的作法要加以纠正和克服，对积极的一面要加以保护和支持。关键是引导乡镇企业执行国家产业政策，提高产品质量，降低物质消耗，适应市场的需要。1990年各级银行要对乡镇企业的流动资金给予适当的支持。
    发展农业，不仅是农业部门的事情，而且是需要全党全国和各个方面共同办好的事情。全国上下、各行各业都要动员起来，大力支援农业，齐心合力办好农业，力争1990年比1989年有一个更好的收成，力争结束农业连续几年的徘徊局面。
    从各个方面采取积极措施，努力保持工业生产的适度增长。进行治理整顿，是要把过高的工业速度降下来，同时要努力保持适当的增长速度。速度过高不好，速度过低同样不好。从中央到地方都要采取强有力的措施，加强组织领导，千方百计解决好当前工业生产面临的困难和问题，使生产逐步回升和平稳发展。我们的设想是：1990年工业总产值比1989年增长6％、国民生产总值增长5％。今后要在调整结构、提高效益的基础上，逐步使国民生产总值平均每年增长6％左右，以便到本世纪末使国民生产总值再翻一番，人民生活达到小康水平，实现我国社会主义现代化经济建设的第二步战略目标。
    为了搞好1990年的工业生产，需要采取以下一些措施：
    一是千方百计搞活流通，使货畅其流。商业、物资、供销和外贸系统，要积极收购适销对路的产品和优质名牌产品，充分发挥国营商业的主渠道和“蓄水池”作用。银行要适当增加对这些部门的收购资金贷款。商业、物资、供销和外贸部门，要积极开拓市场，采取多种多样的方式推销商品，特别是要采取多种渠道送货下乡，开拓农村市场，努力增加货币的商品回笼。我们的国家是一个拥有11亿人口、8亿多农民的大国，这几年城乡居民收入增长较快，而且随着生产的发展，收入还会逐步增长。我国的市场是很广阔的，我们要努力去开拓它。
    二是切实把工业生产的重点放到调整产品结构和提高经济效益上来。当前市场销售疲软的一个重要原因，是产品不适销对路和产品质量差。现在商店里滞销的，是那些质次价高，花色款式陈旧，供大于求的商品；而那些款式新颖、价廉物美的商品还是供不应求，仍然是顾客盈门的抢手货。工业企业特别是生产生活资料的企业，应当学会运用和适应市场调节的规律，根据国内和国际市场需求的变化来组织生产，及时调整产品结构，增加花色品种，提高产品质量。我们实行计划经济与市场调节相结合，在这里正是要发挥市场调节的作用。轻纺、机电行业，要利用调整的时机，积极开发新产品，增加出口产品和能够替代进口产品的生产，为国家多创外汇和节约外汇。为了进一步调动企业和职工的积极性、主动性，企业承包经营责任制要继续坚持，同时要认真总结实践经验，兴利除弊，不断加以完善。
    为了应付即将到来的外债偿还高峰，必须压缩进口，增加外汇储备。这是关系我国在世界上的信誉问题，也是关系国家独立的问题。1990年要对进口商品实行更为严格的限制措施，原则上国内能生产的，在质量和性能上能够代替进口产品的，要控制或限制进口。这与我们执行对外开放政策并不矛盾。我们引进先进技术的目的，是增强自力更生的能力，而不是要长期依赖外国。10年来，我们已引进大批国外先进技术，现在是到开花结果的时候了。同时，我们要继续引进国外先进技术、引进专利和样机，并加以消化吸收，实行国产化。要开发新产品，降低消耗，提高效益，企业必须加强技术改造，提高经营管理水平。搞技术改造，不花一点投入是不行的。但是，投入的主体是企业，要靠企业自己挖掘潜力，把有限的资金用于技术改造。各级政府也要适当予以支持，银行的技术改造贷款额度要适当增加一些。对外开放，是我国必须长期坚持的方针。我们要充分利用国际形势的有利因素，积极扩大对外开放，使对外开放与治理整顿互相促进。要继续积极有效地利用外资和先进技术，进一步改善投资环境，办好“三资”企业，努力根据产业政策吸引更多的外商直接投资。要进一步办好经济特区，继续提倡和鼓励沿海一些地区发展外向型经济。经济特区和沿海开放地区的基本政策措施不变，并要在实践中逐步加以完善。
    三是认真贯彻执行国家产业政策。要采取多种有效的措施，切实把关系国计民生的物质消耗低、经济效益好的国营大中型企业的生产尽量保上去。对那些生产日用必需品的中小工业企业，也要实行保护政策。从中央到地方都要按行业、分地区排出一批必须保的企业名单，在银行贷款、能源、原材料供应和运力方面，实行倾斜政策。
    四是加强对重要生产资料的计划管理。要强调指令性计划的严肃性。适当增加某些重要的紧缺的物资由国家统一分配的部分，以保证国家重点生产建设的需要。
    五是搞好对工业生产的组织领导和调度。在当前情况下，企业的外部环境变化很大。地方、企业随时都会出现一些意想不到的困难和问题。为了保持生产的衔接和正常运转，从宏观方面加强管理，国务院要进一步加强对全国工业生产的组织和调度，各省、市、自治区也要根据自己的情况，相应加强工业生产的组织调度工作。
    积极开拓生产、多种经营和服务门路，努力安排待业人员。在治理整顿期间，随着投资规模的压缩和产业结构的调整，有的企业目前处于停产和半停产的状况，待业人员增加，这是难以完全避免的现象。如何安排好待业人员，需要引起高度重视。从中央到地方都必须切实加强领导，周密安排，认真做好待业人员的工作。要向大家讲明，我们的困难是暂时的，我们要在困难的时候看到光明，增强克服困难的信心。各级工会是在各级党委领导下工作的，一方面应该反映工人的实际困难，另一方面更需要引导工人顾全大局，帮助党和政府共同克服困难。
    要加强对停工待业人员的组织管理，动员他们在厂内进行各种有益的活动，如维修设备，清仓利库，整顿厂容，改善环境和组织各种学习和技术培训，不要把他们推到社会上去。要确保停工待业人员的基本生活，区别不同情况，发给适当的工资或生活费。
    积极开拓生产领域，在城市和农村增加新的就业机会，尽量减少待业人员。在城市里，要组织好各种社会服务，增加商业网点，广开各种就业门路。同时，要组织从城镇回乡的人员，参加兴修水利、植树造林、修筑桥梁道路，以及从事开发性农业。为了广开就业门路，发展社会生产，要继续坚持以公有制为主体，发展多种经济成份。个体经济和私营经济，是对社会主义经济的有益的、必要的补充。应当对它们加强管理和引导，鼓励它们在国家允许的范围内继续发展，发挥它们在发展生产、方便生活和扩大就业等方面的积极作用，限制其不利于社会主义经济发展的消极作用。
    为了减轻城镇就业的压力，这几年特别要严格控制职工人数和农业人口转为非农业人口。同时，要利用这个机会把社会保险和社会保障制度逐步建立起来。
    严格加强市场物价管理，控制物价上涨幅度。逐年降低通货膨胀率和物价上涨幅度，是治理整顿的一项基本任务。实现1990年控制物价上涨幅度的任务是很艰巨的。继续控制社会总需求，是控制物价上涨的根本措施。要从严控制部门和企业的自行涨价。对群众基本生活必需品的价格和劳务收费，采取基本稳定的政策，其中有些生活必需品要明确规定不涨价。要认真清理各种收费标准，严格取缔和禁止滥涨价、滥收费。要强化市场物价管理，加强物价的监督检查，特别是要发挥群众与社会舆论对物价的监督作用。继续实行物价控制目标责任制。1990年仍然要把控制物价上涨幅度作为考核各级政府工作的重要内容。
    坚持紧缩方针，真正过几年紧日子。这是克服财政经济困难、缓解诸种矛盾的极为重要的一环。现在大家都赞成过几年紧日子，但是，目前不少地方、部门和单位，还没有真正过紧日子的气氛和紧迫感。投资规模膨胀、消费需求过快增长的问题还没有根本解决，过大的财政支出在有些地方还没有压下来，生产、建设、流通和其它领域的铺张浪费现象仍然相当严重。这种状况如不下决心改变，通货膨胀就难以消除，我们的经济就无法走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。1990年必须继续控制社会总需求，坚持财政信贷双紧的方针。这一点决不能动摇，动摇了，治理整顿、深化改革已经取得的初步成果就可能丧失掉。这就要求，从上到下、各个方面想问题、办事情，都要充分体现过紧日子的要求。在建设方面，必须把固定资产投资规模控制在计划要求的水平上，不能突破。各地也不要扩大自筹投资规模。要进一步压缩非经营性投资规模，继续做好清理在建项目的工作，严格控制新上项目。同时，要进一步调整投资结构。在基本建设项目审批权限方面，中央下放给省的权限不变，但中央要规定投资规模，要按照产业政策引导投资方向。省下放的项目审批权限，则要适当集中到省一级。在消费方面，职工收入的增长幅度，一定要低于国民收入和劳动生产率的增长幅度。1989年控制社会集团购买力取得很大成绩，1990年要继续严格控制。在财政支出方面，要下决心把经济过热时抬高起来的各项支出盘子缩减下来，行政事业单位要过紧日子，企业也要过紧日子。中央对地方实行财政包干的体制不变。同时，为了逐步提高财政收入占国民收入的比重和中央财政收入占整个财政收入的比重，在信贷方面，继续控制贷款规模和货币投放，不能突破计划规定的控制指标。要继续发挥金融在宏观调控中的重要作用。保值储蓄对稳定市场、稳定金融起了显著作用，要继续实行，并鼓励和提倡城乡居民为国家也为自己积极参加储蓄。金融部门要注意适时调节，加强分类指导，调整信贷结构，把贷款的发放和管理工作做得更好。
    各地方、各行各业，都要反对各种铺张浪费，提倡厉行节约，勤俭办一切事业。在当前情况下，只有下决心真正过几年紧日子，包括中央和地方、国家和企业，才能都过得去。
    三、加强全局观念，认真转变作风，把各项任务落到实处
    1990年经济工作的大政方针已经确定下来，关键在于狠抓落实。
    要增强全局观念，加强组织性、纪律性。治理整顿，势必要对现有的利益格局进行必要的调整。落实1990年的计划，提高一些省、市上交中央财政的比例，减少一些地区的财政补贴，适当增加重要物资由国家统一分配的部分，继续压缩投资规模、调整投资结构等等，这些都会直接或间接地触动地方和部门的利益。现在中央有困难，地方也有困难，但是中央的困难更大一些，而且，中央的困难是影响到全局的困难。现在采取的措施，都是在兼顾中央和地方的前提下制定的。希望大家从全局利益出发，为国家多作出一些贡献。前几年，强调局部利益多了，强调全局利益少了，国家观念、整体观念淡薄了。这种倾向应当切实加以改变。必须明白，中国是统一的国家，中国的经济是统一的经济。经济工作同其它工作一样，必须坚持民主集中制的原则。党中央、国务院在重大经济决策定下来以前，要同地方商量，充分听取地方的意见，力求集思广益，使决策切合实际，具有较高的科学性。一旦作出了决定，各地方、各部门一定要尽力做好，不能打折扣，不能各行其是。今后要把能否自觉地维护全局的利益、全国的利益、全党的利益，能否认真执行国家的政策和计划，作为考核领导干部的一条最重要标准。
    要改进领导作风，深入基层，深入群众，研究问题和解决问题。必须大兴调查研究之风，提倡领导干部深入实际，深入基层，深入群众，研究新情况，解决新问题，及时总结经验，纠正工作偏差。领导机关要有计划地组织机关干部到生产建设第一线，和基层干部一起，解决工作中的实际困难。这也是培养和锻炼干部的重要途径。
    要增强责任感，健全责任制，各司其职，各尽其责。经济困难时期，是对各级领导机关和领导干部的一种考验。越是有困难，越需要领导机关和领导干部，积极主动地负起责任，想方设法去排除困难，做好工作。治理整顿和深化改革的各项任务和措施，应该由哪个部门落实的，那个部门就应当负责落实；应该由哪一级解决的问题，那一级就要负责解决。不能互相扯皮，上下推诿。各部门、各地方都要大胆地工作，敢于负责，不要等待观望。国务院将对各部门、各地区贯彻落实中央《决定》的情况，定期进行监督检查。
    要进一步加强思想政治工作，团结和依靠群众完成各项任务。做好经济工作必须有强有力的思想政治工作来保证，越是有困难，越要加强思想政治工作。现在，经济和社会的矛盾比较复杂，各种思想问题比较多，迫切需要有针对性地进行思想教育。我们要把经济方面存在的困难、问题，以及解决办法和光明前景，都告诉群众，争取群众的理解和支持，以便动员和激励广大工人、农民和知识分子，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，为完成1990年的经济计划和各项任务多做贡献。在企业中要继续实行和完善厂长负责制，确保厂长独立负责地行使经营管理、生产指挥、技术开发等方面的职权，同时，要加强企业党组织的政治思想领导作用，大力加强和改善思想政治工作。厂长和党委书记都要互相支持，互相配合，同心协力办好企业，带领群众共同克服困难。
    做好1990年的经济工作，具有十分重要的意义。我们相信，只要全国上下认真贯彻十三届五中全会的精神，同心协力，努力工作，就一定能够克服各种暂时困难，使1990年的经济工作取得新的进展，沿着持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道继续前进。
