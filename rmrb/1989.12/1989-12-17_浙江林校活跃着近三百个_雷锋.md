The Leifeng Volunteer Association at Zhejiang Forestry School has grown from its original 80 members to 293, fostering a culture of learning from Leifeng and doing good deeds both on and off campus. The initial motivation for establishing the association was simple: the students hoped to contribute to improving the school's atmosphere. Their first activity was cleaning the school's neglected corners. Some students wore large straw hats with the brims pulled down low, as if afraid to be seen. Some male students deliberately threw their dirty clothes in front of female students, saying, "You're from the Leifeng Volunteer Association, so go ahead and pick them up to wash."

However, the members of the Leifeng Volunteer Association ignored the mockery and criticism, starting with small acts and working quietly: trash disappeared from the corridors; meal trays in the cafeteria were numbered to prevent mix-ups; on Saturday afternoons, the bicycle repair group offered free services to students. Gradually, their actions were understood and praised by their fellow students.

When the "yellow tide" was corrupting some youth, Zhejiang Forestry School was not immune. Unhealthy music and publications also found their way in.

Facing this situation, the Leifeng Volunteer Association, with the help of the school's Communist Youth League committee, launched a "Five Good" campaign across the school: "Read good books, sing good songs, watch good films, do good deeds, and be good students." They emphasized traditional education and actively recruited underperforming students into the association. Rich and varied cultural activities and Leifeng good deed campaigns helped students understand the meaning of life, leading to a welcome change in their spiritual outlook.

This year, when Lishui City selected the top ten news stories on spiritual civilization construction, the school's "Leifeng Volunteer Association" topped the list.

A student named Yang from the Economic Forestry major came from Hubei Province. His parents had divorced when he was young, and he was raised by his adoptive father. After entering the school in 1986, he unfortunately contracted hepatitis and was hospitalized. The cost of treatment and recuperation was high, and he did not dare to ask his adoptive father for money, so he had to borrow from his classmates, accumulating over 1,000 yuan in debt. The hardships of life also affected his academic performance, which had previously been excellent. At this time, the Leifeng Volunteer Association organized a fundraising drive on campus. To help him recover and assist more students, they decided to establish a Leifeng Fund. They proposed an initiative: "Donate one cent, accumulate ten cents of love, do a hundred good deeds, bring warmth to a thousand families, and cultivate ten thousand Leifengs." Students contributed whatever they could, and in a few days, they raised hundreds of yuan. When Yang received these warm and loving donations, a surge of warmth filled his heart.

    浙江林校活跃着近三百个“雷锋”
    浙江林校学雷锋理事会日益壮大，从原先的80人发展到293人，校园内外学雷锋做好事蔚然成风。学雷锋理事会初创时的动机，说来简单得很，这些同学只期望能对校风的好转起推动作用。第一次搞活动，是清扫学校的卫生死角，有的同学劳动时戴个大草帽，帽沿压得老低，生怕被人看见似的。有的男生故意将脏衣服扔在女同学面前，说她是学雷锋理事会的，快拎起来拿去洗吧。
    但是，学雷锋理事会的同学们不顾别人的讽刺挖苦，从点滴事情做起，默默地干了起来：走廊上垃圾不见了；食堂里易搞错的饭盒被编上了号；星期六下午，自行车小组为同学免费修车……他们的行动渐渐被同学们理解、称赞。
    当“黄色污流”吞噬着一些青年的时候，浙江林校也并非一块净土，靡靡之音、不健康的书刊也乘隙而入。
    面对这种现状，学雷锋理事会在校团委的协助下，在全校开展了“读好书，唱好歌，看好影视，做好事，当好学生”的争“五好”活动，进行传统教育，并注重吸收后进同学入会。丰富多采的文娱生活和学雷锋做好事活动，使同学们懂得了人生的意义，精神面貌发生了可喜的转变。
    今年丽水市评选精神文明建设十大新闻，该校“学雷锋理事会”名列榜首。
    经济林专业一位姓杨的学生来自湖北省，从小父母离异，由养父带大，1986年入校后不幸患肝炎，住进医院，医治与调养，要花许多钱，他不敢向养父伸手，只好向同学东借西凑，共欠了别人1000多元钱。生活的艰难，使这个优等生的成绩也受到影响。这时，学雷锋理事会在校园里搞了一次募捐活动。为了治好他的病，也为了帮助更多的同学，他们决定设立学雷锋基金。他们提出倡议：“捐一分钱，积十分爱，做百条好事，送千家温暖，树万个雷锋。”同学们你一角，我一元，把节衣缩食省下的钱捐给有困难的同学，没几天，就筹集到数百元。当杨同学接过这些带着温暖、含着爱的钱时，一股暖流涌上心头。
