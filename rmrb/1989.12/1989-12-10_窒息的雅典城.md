On November 2, 1989, the beautiful city of Athens was shrouded in a thick, gray haze. The world-renowned ancient fortress lost its former glory, appearing dull and lifeless in the dusty fog. Although the sun hung high in the sky, its rays struggled to penetrate the polluted atmosphere.

The narrow streets were still bustling with cars. Around 4:30 PM, amidst the endless stream of vehicles in the city center, a striking procession appeared: over 20 bicycles moved slowly along the street. The cyclists wore gas masks, and their bikes were adorned with red and green balloons. They chanted, "Do we want pollution, or do we want ourselves?" and "Please don't just filter cigarettes, filter the exhaust pipes too!"

For the historic city of Athens, this was a "sad day." Air pollution had reached an unprecedented level of severity. The air quality monitoring station on Patission Street in the city center had been issuing red alerts since morning. According to Greek national standards, if the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air reaches 200 micrograms per cubic meter, it is considered a warning level, and if it reaches 500 micrograms per cubic meter, it is considered an emergency danger level. However, by just after 9 AM, the station's readings showed that the air contained 318 micrograms of carbon dioxide per cubic meter. By 11 AM, the testers could hardly believe their eyes as the instrument displayed 604 micrograms. An emergency report was immediately sent to the Ministry of Environment, Urban Planning, and Public Works. Professor Zalifos, the special environmental secretary, announced a series of emergency measures, including banning all private cars from the city center, restricting the movement of taxis and motorcycles, requiring major industrial enterprises to reduce fuel consumption by 50%, and shutting down all fuel boilers. In an unprecedented move, the ministry also declared that all schools in the Athens area would be closed to ensure students' health and reduce traffic congestion.

Despite these emergency measures, air pollution continued to worsen. By noon, the instruments showed that the carbon dioxide concentration had reached 631 micrograms per cubic meter, breaking the previous record of 621 micrograms per cubic meter. Carbon monoxide levels also exceeded dangerous limits. Many residents experienced symptoms of pollution poisoning, such as headaches, fatigue, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. Ambulances wailed through the streets. According to the National Emergency Center, 63 people were rushed to the hospital that day, and countless others sought medical help on their own. Most of these people suffered from heart disease and respiratory illnesses triggered by air pollution. It was not until 5 PM that the carbon dioxide concentration in the air dropped to 217 micrograms per cubic meter, still above the national warning level. The next day, air quality showed no significant improvement, and all emergency measures remained in effect, with students still unable to attend school.

Athens did not reach such a severe level of air pollution by chance. In ancient times, Athens paid great attention to environmental protection in its urban planning, stipulating that all pollution sources must be kept away from the city. However, with the modernization of Athens, various pollution sources within the city have continued to increase, making Athens one of the most polluted cities in the world. Statistics show that from 1981 to the present, emergency measures have been taken 19 times. The most recent occurrence was on October 31 and November 1 of this year. Just a day after the emergency measures were lifted, an even more severe pollution event occurred.

For many years, the Greek government has been working to improve the environmental quality of Athens, but the results have not been significant. During this air pollution incident, Environment Minister Liakos of the caretaker government appealed to the leaders of Greece's two major political parties, the New Democracy Party and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, who were busy with the elections, hoping that whoever comes to power will take strong measures to address environmental pollution. He proposed that over the next five years, 2% of the national GDP be allocated annually for environmental protection; that the parliament debate and report on environmental protection plans and their implementation results for periods of three years or more; and that priority be given to projects aimed at improving the environmental quality of Athens, protecting forests, protecting the environment of energy-producing areas, and protecting marine and coastal environments. It seems that environmental protection in Athens will be an urgent issue that the new Greek government must address.

    窒息的雅典城
    亚力
    1989年11月2日，美丽的雅典城笼罩在一片灰蒙蒙的烟雾中。举世闻名的古城堡失去了往日的雄姿，在尘雾中显得暗淡无神。天空中虽然高悬着太阳，但阳光却难以穿过污浊的大气。
    狭窄的街道上，小汽车依旧川流不息。下午4点30分左右，在市中心大街上，在不见首尾的汽车长龙中，出现了一支引人注目的队伍：20多辆自行车沿街缓缓行进，骑车者戴着防毒面具，车上系着红红绿绿的气球。“要污染，还是要我们？”他们不断高呼：“不要只给香烟装过滤嘴，请为排气管也装上过滤嘴吧！”
  这一天，对历史悠久的世界文化名城雅典来说，是一个“可悲的日子”。大气污染达到空前严重的程度。设在市中心帕底雄大街上的大气质量监测站从早晨起便不断发出红色危险讯号。按希腊国家标准规定，每立方米空气中二氧化碳浓度达到200微克，便达到警戒线，达到500微克便达到紧急危险标准。而这天上午9点刚过，该站测试的结果表明空气中二氧化碳含量已高达每立方米318微克。到11时，测试人员几乎不相信自己的眼睛，测试仪器上显示出了604的数字。紧急危险报告立刻送到国家环境、城市规划和公共事业部。即刻，该部特别环境秘书泽莱弗斯教授宣布一系列紧急措施，其中包括禁止所有私人汽车在雅典市中心区行驶，限制出租车和摩托车的行驶，要求主要工业企业将燃料消耗削减50％，所有燃料锅炉停产等，并同教育部一起史无前例地宣布雅典地区学校一律停课，以保证学生健康和减少交通流量。
    虽然采取了一系列紧急措施，大气污染程度依然有增无减。中午，测试仪器无情地表明，空气中二氧化碳含量已高达每立方米631微克，打破了此前每立方米621微克的纪录。一氧化碳的浓度也突破了危险界限。许多市民出现了头疼、乏力、呕吐、呼吸困难等污染中毒症状。街道上救护车响着揪心的笛声呼啸而过。据国家急救中心报告，当天经该中心救护送往医院的患者就有63人，而自行到医院就诊的病人则难计其数。这些人患的大多是由大气污染诱发的心脏病和呼吸系统疾病。直到下午17时，大气中二氧化碳含量才下降到每立方米217微克，仍在国家警戒标准以上。次日，大气质量仍无明显改善，各项紧急措施继续实行，学生仍然不得不留在家中。
    雅典大气污染达到如此严重的程度并非偶然。古代雅典在城市建设中对环境保护曾予以充分重视，当时规定各种污染源必须远离城区。但是，随着雅典城市的现代化，市内各种污染源不断增加，雅典已成为世界上环境污染最严重的城市之一。据统计，从1981年到现在，已19次采取紧急措施了。最近的一次是在今年10月31日和11月1日。而就在刚刚宣布紧急措施解除后的次日，便出现了更为严重的污染。
    多年来，希腊政府一直在努力改善雅典的环境质量，但效果似乎并不显著。在这次大气污染事件发生之际，看守政府的环境部长利雅斯卡斯先生向正忙于大选的希腊主要两大政党新民主党和全希腊社会主义运动的领导人发出呼吁，希望无论谁执政，都要大力解决环境污染问题。他提议：在今后5年中，每年将国民生产总值的2％用于环境保护；议会要就为期3年以上的环保计划及其实施结果进行辩论，并提出年度报告；对提高雅典环境质量、保护森林、保护能源产地环境以及保护海洋环境和海岸线等项目予以优先重视。看来，雅典市环境保护将是希腊新政府面临的一个迫切要解决的难题。
