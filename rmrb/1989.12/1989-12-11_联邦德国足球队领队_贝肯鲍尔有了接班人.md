West Germany's national football team coach Franz Beckenbauer will hand over the reins of the national team after the 1990 Italy World Cup. His successor will be the current youth team coach Berti Vogts.

This news was announced recently by the West German Football Association in Frankfurt. The association stated in a press release that Beckenbauer will end his duties as the national team coach after the 1990 Italy World Cup. After the World Cup, the new national team coach will be Vogts (42 years old). Vogts will have a four-year term with full authority.

The 44-year-old Beckenbauer was once West Germany's record-holding national team player. He participated in over a hundred international matches for the national team and contributed significantly to the peak period of West German football. He took on the role of national team coach in 1984. In a few years, the West German team achieved more victories than defeats, especially the current team, whose players have high technical skills, and several young players have shown outstanding performance.

    联邦德国足球队领队
    贝肯鲍尔有了接班人
    联邦德国国家足球队领队贝肯鲍尔将在一九九○年意大利世界杯赛后让出国家队的“指挥棒”。他的接班人是现青年队教练贝尔提·福格茨。
    这一消息是联邦德国足球联合会最近在法兰克福宣布的。足联在一份新闻公报中说，贝肯鲍尔将在一九九○年意大利世界杯赛后结束他作为国家足球队领队的活动。世界杯赛结束后，新的国家队教练将是福格茨（四十二岁）。福格茨任期为四年，享有全权。
    今年四十四岁的贝肯鲍尔曾是联邦德国创纪录的国家队队员，他代表国家队参加过一百多场国际比赛，为联邦德国足球运动达到鼎盛时期作出过贡献。他于一九八四年任国家队领队，几年内联邦德国队胜多负少，尤其是目前的这支国家队，队员技术水平齐，几名年轻队员表现十分出色。
