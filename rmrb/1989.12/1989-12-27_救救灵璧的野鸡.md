The mountainous regions of Jiuding and Yugou in Lingbi County, Anhui Province, are characterized by their peaks, ravines, and dense vegetation, making them an ideal habitat for wild pheasants. Historically, this area has been a breeding ground for these birds. However, due to prolonged excessive hunting, the wild pheasant population here is now on the brink of extinction. It is estimated that the remaining wild pheasants in Yugou and Jiuding do not exceed 300.

Under normal circumstances, the annual growth rate of wild pheasants is tenfold. If the wild pheasants in Lingbi are protected from this point forward, within three years, Lingbi could become a breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of wild pheasants.

Internationally, most pheasant species are on the verge of extinction, and China has listed wild pheasants as a protected species. This underscores the preciousness of Lingbi's pheasant resources. It is hoped that the local government and citizens, along with domestic and international pheasant protection organizations, will work together to make Lingbi the first wild pheasant breeding base in the East China region.

    救救灵璧的野鸡
    安徽省灵璧县九顶、渔沟一带山区，峰峦洞壑，草虫丛生，自古以来就是野鸡繁衍之地。然而，这里的野鸡因为长期遭到狂捕滥杀，已濒于绝种。据估计，渔沟、九顶等地幸存的野鸡最多不超过300只。
    在一般的情况下，野鸡年增长率为十倍。如果从现在起，灵璧的野鸡受到保护，在三年之后，灵璧将是一个拥有数十万只野鸡生长的基地。
    在国际上现存雉类大都濒于灭绝，我国也把野鸡列为保护之列。由此可见，灵璧这一雉类资源十分珍贵。希望当地政府和公民与国内外雉类保护组织共同努力，使灵璧成为华东地区的第一个野鸡繁殖基地。　灵璧县　解安中
