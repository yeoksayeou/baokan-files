Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 4th.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has decided to accelerate the cleanup of problematic loans within its current 600 billion yuan in assets to tap into potential funds and maintain the integrity and security of its credit assets.

Statistics show that by the end of last year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China system alone had nearly 30 billion yuan in non-performing loans, risky loans, and loans that had been misappropriated or embezzled, accounting for more than 5% of the bank's total loan portfolio.

Huang Yuzhun, vice president of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, proposed at a teleconference on cleaning up credit assets held in Beijing today that the bank should, based on the completion of a comprehensive audit and a clear understanding of its financial situation, shift its focus to recovering unreasonable loans and fully implementing debt guarantees. The goal is to recover approximately 7 billion yuan in problematic loans by next year.

    工商银行加紧清贷
    力争明年收回有问题贷款70亿
    据新华社北京12月4日电　（记者丁坚铭）中国工商银行今天决定，对现有6000亿元资产中各种有问题的贷款加紧进行清理，以挖掘资金潜力，维护信贷资产的完整和安全。
    据统计，截至去年底，仅中国工商银行系统就有呆帐贷款、风险贷款和挤占挪用等有问题的贷款近300亿元，约占工商银行贷款总额的5％多。
    工商银行副行长黄玉峻今天在此间召开的工商银行清理信贷资产电话会议上提出，工商银行下一步应在基本完成全面清查、摸清家底基础上，适时地把重点转到清收不合理贷款和全面落实债权保障上来，力争明年收回有问题贷款70亿元左右。
