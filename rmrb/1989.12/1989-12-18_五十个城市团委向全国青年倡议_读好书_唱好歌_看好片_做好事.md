Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th. People's Daily reporters He Ping and Yuan Jianda reported: Today, the youth leagues of 50 major and medium-sized cities across the country issued an appeal, calling on all levels of youth organizations to participate in the campaign to eliminate pornography and other social evils. The appeal urges young people to read good books, sing good songs, watch good films, and do good deeds.

At a symposium on eliminating the "six evils" and strengthening youth cultural construction, organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, attendees unanimously adopted this appeal.

The appeal suggests that youth organizations should effectively use various forms of social supervision to assist public security and judicial departments in cracking down on and prohibiting prostitution, the production and distribution of obscene materials, the trafficking of women and children, the cultivation, use, and trafficking of drugs, gambling, and the use of feudal superstition to defraud and harm people. At the same time, it emphasizes the protection of the legal rights of minors and the promotion of the formulation and implementation of the Law on the Protection of Minors. Special attention should be paid to mobilizing young people to resist the infiltration of the "six evils" and to do a good job of educating and guiding those who have been harmed.

The appeal points out that reading good books, singing good songs, watching good films, and doing good deeds are meaningful in making the cultural life of young people colorful and healthy. Without the prosperity of cultural construction, there will be no real success in eliminating pornography and other social evils. It is hoped that all levels of youth organizations will do more to enrich the cultural life of young people, and that the whole society will contribute to creating a better environment for the growth of young people.

Liu Yandong and Li Yuanchao attended the meeting and spoke.

    五十个城市团委向全国青年倡议
    读好书　唱好歌　看好片　做好事
    本报北京12月17日电  新华社记者何平、本报记者袁建达报道：全国50个大、中城市团委今天发出一项倡议，号召各级团组织都来参加扫黄除害斗争，团员青年都来读好书，唱好歌，看好片，做好事。
    在由团中央举办的除“六害”、加强青年文化建设座谈会上，与会同志一致通过了这个倡议。
    倡议书提出，团组织要善于通过各种有效的社会监督方式，协助公安司法部门打击和查禁取缔卖淫嫖娼、制作贩卖传播淫秽物品、拐卖妇女儿童、私种吸食贩运毒品、聚众赌博、利用封建迷信骗财害人等社会丑恶现象和犯罪活动。同时，把除害同维护青少年合法权益结合起来，积极推进未成年人保护法的制定和实施。要特别注意发动团员青年自觉抵制“六害”的侵蚀，也要认真做好受毒害青年的规劝帮教工作。
    倡议书指出，读好书，唱好歌，看好片，做好事，实际意义在于让青年的文化生活多彩多姿，健康向上。没有文化建设的繁荣兴旺，就不会有扫黄除害的真正成功。希望各级团组织为活跃青年文化生活多做实事，全社会都来为优化青少年成长环境尽一份力量。
    刘延东、李源潮出席了会议并讲了话。
