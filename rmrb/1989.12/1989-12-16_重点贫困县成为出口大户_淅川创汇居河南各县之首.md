    The key poverty-stricken county of Xichuan in Henan Province has led the province's counties in export earnings for three consecutive years. From January to November this year, the county's export earnings reached 20 million yuan. Ninety-one percent of the impoverished households have escaped poverty.

    Xichuan County is located in the Fuyu Mountain area, with dense forests, abundant mineral resources, wide water surfaces, and fertile mudflats. However, a few years ago, the lives of the people on this land, rich in natural resources, were very impoverished. To shake off poverty, the county has been determined to rely on its own efforts, transforming its rich resource advantages into economic advantages, and vigorously developing export industries.

    In the past, the county had a certain foundation for utilizing resources to earn foreign exchange, but relying solely on selling resources and rough processing not only wasted resources but also yielded little. The county committee and government learned from this lesson, focusing on the scientific utilization of resources. They increased investment in education and used various means to train talents, with over 200,000 people receiving technical training, of whom 80,000 can master one or two specialized skills. They also opened the doors to the mountains, attracting technology and talent from outside. Over the years, they have introduced 66 technological items and hundreds of talents.

    Scientific planning and the introduction of advanced technology have made Xichuan County's export industry develop rapidly. Currently, it has formed five major export bases: building materials centered around marble, leather products centered around dragon grass, livestock products centered around cattle, sheep, and rabbits, carpet production centered around silk and wool carpets, and specialty products centered around chili peppers. They have organized series production, and many products have created famous brands. Their silk and wool carpets are exported to dozens of countries and regions, including West Germany and the United States. This alone has earned 8 million US dollars this year, increasing farmers' income by 24 million yuan.

    重点贫困县成为出口大户
    淅川创汇居河南各县之首
    本报郑州12月15日电　记者李而亮、李杰报道：被国家列为重点贫困县的河南省淅川县，年出口创汇连续3年居河南各县之首。今年1至11月，这个县出口创汇已达2000万元。91％贫困户已冲出贫困线。
    淅川县地处伏牛山区，有茂密山林、丰富矿藏，又有宽阔水面、肥沃滩涂。但在几年前，这片自然资源令人羡慕的土地上，群众生活却很贫困。为摆脱贫困，该县立志自力更生，变丰富资源优势为经济优势，大力发展出口创汇产业。
    这个县过去利用资源出口创汇有一定基础，由于仅仅依靠卖资源、粗加工；既浪费了资源、又收效甚微。县委、县政府吸取这个教训，用力在科学利用资源上下功夫，他们为此抓好劳动者素质的提高和技术人才的引进。对内增加教育的投入，利用多种手段培训人才，使20多万人次得到了技术培训，其中8万人能掌握一至二门专门技术；对外打开山门，广罗技术和人才。几年来共引进各种技术66项、人才几百人次。
    科学的规划和先进技术的引导，使淅川县出口创汇业发展迅速。目前，已形成了以大理石为主的建材业，龙须草为主的革制品生产，牛羊兔为主的畜产品，丝毛织地毯为主的地毯生产，以辣椒为主的土特产生产等五大出口创汇商品基地。并组织了系列化生产，不少产品创出了名牌，他们生产的丝毛地、壁毯，远销西德、美国等几十个国家和地区，仅此一项，今年已创汇800万美元，为农民增加收入2400万元人民币。
