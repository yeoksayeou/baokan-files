Japanese companies place great emphasis on behavioral science education for young employees to foster a sense of collectivism and love for the company. One unique aspect of this is "dormitory education."

The term "dormitory" refers to company-provided collective housing for newly employed single workers. These dormitories, funded by the company, are equipped with dining halls, bathrooms, laundries, recreation rooms, and lounges. The company assigns morally upright and experienced supervisors, known as "dormitory supervisors" and "dormitory mothers," to manage these facilities. The supervisors handle security, communications, and mail, while the dormitory mothers are responsible for cooking, cleaning, and laundry. Their most important task is to educate young workers who have just left school and entered the workforce.

Upon moving into the dormitory, each young worker receives a detailed "Dormitory Rules" booklet. This booklet regulates every aspect of their daily lives, from clothing and dining to walking and using the restroom. For example, it stipulates that workers should not walk with their shirts unbuttoned, should not put their hands in their pockets while talking to others, should not make loud noises while eating, and should wash their underwear every two days. Life in the dormitory is highly regimented, with a 6 AM wake-up call via the public address system and a 11 PM lights-out requirement. On Sundays, workers are organized to clean the environment, participate in small-scale sports activities, or go on outings.

"Dormitory education" helps young workers gradually develop independent living skills and strengthens the cohesion of the enterprise. Moreover, some companies also implement "dormitory education" for section and department-level managers, requiring them to live together for a month each year to summarize experiences, share insights, and continuously improve their leadership abilities. In Japan, dormitory education has become an essential part of corporate employee training and continues to this day.

    日本企业的“寮教育”
    日本各企业十分重视对青年职工进行行为科学教育，以培养职员的集体主义爱社精神，其中独具特色的是“寮教育”。
    所谓“寮”，即公司提供给刚刚参加工作的单身职工居住的集体宿舍。这种由公司出资建造的集体宿舍内，设有食堂、浴池、洗衣房、娱乐室、会客厅等设施，由公司派出品行端正、经验丰富的寮监、寮母负责管理。寮监负责安全保卫、传呼电话、收发报纸，寮母负责洗衣做饭，打扫卫生，他们最重要的工作是教育刚刚走出校门步入社会的青年职工。青工一入寮，便领到一册内容详尽的《入寮须知》。《须知》对青工的衣食穿戴、坐立行走乃至上便所，都做了详细规定，诸如走路时不得敞胸露怀，同他人交谈时手不能插进口袋，吃饭时不要大声喧哗，内衣裤要两天一洗等等。青工在这里过着准军事化生活，每天早上6点，寮监通过广播系统通知起床，晚上11点，要求青工熄灯就寝。每逢星期天，还要组织青工打扫环境卫生，开展小型体育活动，或去郊外游玩。“寮教育”既能帮助青工逐步养成独立生活的能力，又有助于增强企业的凝聚力。
    不仅如此，有些企业还对科、处级干部，原则上一年进行一个月的“寮教育”。让在职的科、处级干部集中居住，总结经验，交流体会，不断提高其领导能力。在日本，寮教育已作为企业职工教育的重要一环而坚持至今。
