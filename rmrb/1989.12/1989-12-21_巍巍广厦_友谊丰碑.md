At noon on December 19, Chinese President Yang Shangkun and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak together unveiled the Cairo International Conference Center, marking a high point in Yang's friendly visit to Egypt.

Yesterday, the Cairo International Conference Center was filled with a festive atmosphere. When Yang and Mubarak pulled back the curtain covering the commemorative plaque with their portraits, the crowd cheered as they saw the golden characters on the glass plaque reading: "Under the leadership of President Hosni Mubarak and with the presence of the distinguished guest, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, the Cairo International Conference Center was completed and unveiled on December 19, 1989."

The Cairo International Conference Center is located west of the famous Unknown Soldier Memorial and is a group of silver-white buildings constructed with Chinese aid. This is the largest international conference hall in the Middle East, blending the rugged simplicity of ancient Egyptian architecture with the delicate beauty of Chinese architectural art, making it uniquely designed. The center covers 25 hectares and has a building area of over 58,000 square meters. Construction began on January 1, 1986, and took three and a half years to complete. Nearly 700 Chinese technicians and workers participated in the construction. With the active cooperation of the relevant Egyptian authorities and the joint efforts of both countries' workers, the project was completed on schedule. The building complex is centered around a conference hall and a banquet hall, connected by a 160-meter-long exhibition hall and a building that can accommodate 120 national delegations' offices, making it grand and magnificent.

Amidst the applause, the leaders of the two countries entered the building to participate in the formal handover ceremony. When Yang and Mubarak jointly cut the red ribbon with a pair of scissors, photographers eagerly captured this precious moment. The hall erupted in applause, celebrating the official completion of the Cairo International Conference Center.

When Yang and Mubarak entered the main conference hall, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly to welcome the two heads of state. Yang, sitting in a comfortable chair, said, "This chair is very comfortable." Mubarak added, "This chair is also very sturdy." They were both satisfied with the equipment in the conference hall.

Since the start of the Cairo International Conference Center project, it has received the warm attention of the leaders of both countries. On March 19, 1986, former Chinese President Li Xiannian laid the foundation stone for the project and inscribed: "Cairo International Conference Center." President Mubarak has visited the site twice.

After the handover ceremony, President Mubarak delivered a speech, enthusiastically praising the friendship between Egypt and China and thanking the technicians of both countries for their efforts in completing the Cairo International Conference Center. Yang expressed hope that the two countries would use this international conference center as a new starting point, working together to achieve more cooperation and produce more fruitful results.

The Cairo International Conference Center is the largest public building project in China's foreign economic aid. The towering structure is not only a testament to the hard work and ingenuity of Chinese workers but also a fruit of friendly cooperation between China and Egypt. It will stand as a monument to Sino-Egyptian friendship, forever by the banks of the Nile.

    巍巍广厦  友谊丰碑
    本报记者　成元生　林皎明
    12月19日中午，中国国家主席杨尚昆与埃及总统穆巴拉克一起为开罗国际会议中心揭幕剪彩，把杨主席对埃及的友好访问推向一个高潮。
    昨天的开罗国际会议中心，洋溢着一派喜庆气氛。当杨主席和穆巴拉克总统一同缓缓地拉开覆盖在纪念牌上印有两位元首画像的幕布时，人们在热烈的掌声中看到有机玻璃纪念牌上用中文和阿拉伯文写着：“在穆巴拉克总统主持和其贵宾中国杨尚昆主席的惠顾下，开罗国际会议中心于1989年12月19日落成揭幕”的金色字样。
    开罗国际会议中心座落在著名的无名战士纪念碑西侧，是一组银白色建筑群，由中国援建。这座中东地区最大的国际会议大厦，揉合了埃及古建筑的粗犷浑朴和中国建筑艺术的玲珑精美，建筑造型别具一格。中心占地25公顷，建筑面积5.8万多平方米。工程于1986年元旦破土动工，历时三年半，先后有近700名中国技术人员和工人参加施工。在埃及有关方面的积极配合和两国工人的共同努力下按计划如期完成。这组建筑群以会议厅和宴会厅两个圆形建筑为主体，用160米长的展览厅和一座能容纳120个国家代表团办公的大楼相连接，雄伟壮观，富丽堂皇。
    在热烈的掌声中，中埃两国元首步入大厦参加正式交接仪式。当杨主席和穆巴拉克总统共执一把剪刀剪断一根红绸带时，摄影记者纷纷按动照相机快门，拍下这珍贵的镜头。大厅里响起热烈的掌声，祝贺开罗国际会议中心正式落成。
    杨主席在穆巴拉克总统陪同下步入大会议厅时，全场起立，又一次报以热烈的掌声，欢迎两位国家元首的到来。杨主席在软椅上就坐时说，这椅子坐起来很舒服。穆巴拉克总统说，这椅子也很结实。他们对会议厅里的设备感到很满意。
    开罗国际会议中心开工以来，一直得到两国领导人的亲切关怀。1986年3月19日，我国前国家主席李先念为工程开工奠基并题词：“开罗国际会议中心”。穆巴拉克总统曾先后到这里进行了两次视察。
    移交仪式结束后，穆巴拉克总统发表讲话，热情赞扬埃中两国的友谊，感谢两国技术人员为开罗国际会议中心建成所作出的努力。杨主席表示，希望两国以这座国际会议中心为新起点，共同努力，使合作绽出更多的花朵，结出更多的硕果。
    开罗国际会议中心是我国对外经援中最大的一个公共建筑项目。巍巍广厦不仅是中国工人辛勤劳动和聪明才智的结晶，也是中埃两国友好合作的硕果。它将作为中埃友谊的丰碑，永远屹立在尼罗河畔。
