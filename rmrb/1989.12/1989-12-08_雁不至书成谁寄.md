	Childhood classmates, in the bloom of youth, left their hometown to study in Taiwan and the United States. In recent years, they returned to settle in Taiwan. This year in April, with white hair, she returned to her hometown in Jiangsu, carrying a heart full of anxiety and the fear of "the closer to home, the more timid one becomes" and "who is there at home?" She returned to the place where she was born and raised.

	Forty years of wind and rain have passed like a blink of an eye, and the courtyard grass has already become a tomb tree. Her parents have passed away, and her beloved younger brother has died young, leaving only her sister, who is nearly fifty years old. She visited the graves of her parents and her brother's tomb, kowtowing three times and nine times, crying uncontrollably. How can she repay the kindness of her parents, and how can she continue the bond between siblings? The sorrow and grief were endless. After five days of searching for dreams, she left with endless regret and deep sorrow. The affection between relatives could not be fully expressed, and the regret was immense.

	Before leaving, she left a letter for her sister, written thirty years ago while abroad but unable to be sent. She instructed her sister to send it to me to read. I am her only old friend in mainland China.

	I work in Beijing. This time, although we did not meet, the friendship from forty years ago is still deep. Moreover, I was poor in my youth, and it was difficult for me to study. I once relied on her family for food, and the shared hardship made our bond even deeper.

	In the letter written thirty years after leaving home, she wrote: "...When I could finally stop, I quickly found a way to continue my studies, hoping to learn a skill and then return home. In that situation, I had to eat and study, truly 'the poor have no right to be pessimistic; the busy have no time to cry.' At that time, I only imagined returning home without telling you, suddenly appearing at home, surprising you, and then everyone would be happy with tears of joy. Later, after graduating from university, working, and getting married... I still couldn't return. I began to feel anxious. Hua Mulan was away from home for twelve years, and Xue Rengui was away for eighteen years. Du Fu wrote, 'Who knows after twenty years, I will return to the hall of the gentleman,' and twenty years have passed. He Zhu wrote, 'Leaving home young and returning old, the accent is unchanged but the hair is gray,' and I have been away from home for exactly thirty years. Now I know I still can't return, maybe I can't return in this lifetime. I can't see my mother, I can't see my sister, what should I do? Thirty years, although we are on the same earth, although we are blood-related, deeply affectionate, and dreaming of each other. But fellow countrymen cannot reunite, cannot be together, and even communication is difficult. Has there ever been such a sad thing in history?

	When water, land, and air transportation is convenient and even going to the moon is not difficult, I cannot return to my hometown! Especially when those blue-eyed and yellow-haired tourists can visit our Great Wall and enjoy our West Lake, but I, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, cannot. How sad and resentful!

	Why? Why?"

	Indeed, "when geese do not arrive, who can send the letters!" The passionate letter of homesickness has been silent for decades, and the family has never known! The road home after thirty years is still impossible to travel. In these long years, the family members who missed and longed for each other have all passed away, and their spirits are gone!

	After writing this letter, ten more years have passed, and it has been forty years since she left home. She was finally able to step on her homeland, drink a cup of hometown water, cry for her parents, and call for her brother. The sighs of emotion are far beyond what Tang poets could express with "the accent is unchanged but the hair is gray"!

	Holding the letter, tears flow like rain, and the emotions cannot be stopped, so I wrote this poem, "Letter."

	The letter, carrying her homesick heart across ten thousand miles, accompanied by the tears of a wandering child, is stained with spots. It says that the Great Wall cannot be climbed; it says that the water of West Lake cannot be enjoyed. The sincere wind of the frontier blows, calling for the wandering child; with the rhythm of the Huqin, it waits for the returning guest to pack up, and then the joyful music of reunion will sound. The emotions of the letter ripple the green water of a lake, floating with the light and heavy makeup of Xi Shi. Eagerly waiting for the wandering child to see her beauty; singing of homesickness, old friends look up, the homeland stretches for thousands of miles to welcome you, with the same scenery sparkling to welcome you. The moonlight over the hometown is exceptionally bright, and the moon in the sky is also watching our reunion. When will we ride the wind and cross the water to fulfill the longing and remembrance of "the moon rises over the sea, and we share this moment at the end of the earth"!

	The letter, dyed with the tree of longing, willows folded with long branches, still lush and green, will wipe away the wandering child's regret. The wind of the Great Wall will blow away the frost on your temples, and the water of West Lake has already filled with green ripples for you. My room, eagerly awaiting a return date, has already lifted the curtains and opened the eaves, lit the red candles, and filled the golden cups...

	Come back, wandering child!

    雁不至书成谁寄
    孔相如
    少年时代的同窗好友，青春离乡，负笈台湾，游学美国，近年回台湾定居。她于今年四月白发返乡，怀着“近乡情更怯”、“家中有阿谁”的惴惴心情，回到生她育她的江苏老家。
    四十年风雨，弹指沧桑，岂期院草已成坟树。家中父母仙逝，爱弟夭折，只剩下唯一亲人年近半百的妹妹。她到墓木已拱的父母坟和弟弟土丘上奠祭，三拜九叩，痛哭失声。何报三春晖，怎续手足情。悲断凄续，寻梦五天，便带着无限怅惘、绵绵长恨飞去了。亲情难尽叙，其憾恨何如。
    走前，她给妹妹留下一封离家三十年、在海外写给家人而无法投递的信。并嘱妹妹寄给我看看。我算是她在大陆上唯一的故旧好友了。
    我远在北京工作。这次她回来，虽未见着，但四十年前同窗之谊，总是深厚的。何况我少年贫困，求学不易，曾寄食于她当年的平民之家，相濡以沫之情，自比一般同学就更深一层了。
    在离家三十年后，她写的信上说：“……当我能停住脚跟的时候，我赶紧想办法复学，希望能学得一技之长就立刻回家去。在那种情形下，又要吃饭，又要读书，真是‘穷苦的人没有悲观的权利；劳碌的人没有掉泪的时间’。那时候，我只假想我回去先不要写信告诉你们，要突然的到家，吓你们一跳，然后大家再高兴得喜泪横流。后来，大学毕业了，做事了，成家了……我仍然回不去，我开始焦急起来。花木兰离家十二年，薛仁贵离家十八载。杜诗有‘焉知二十载，重上君子堂’，二十年也过去了。贺诗‘少小离家老大回，乡音未改鬓毛摧’，而我离家整整三十年了。现在我知道我仍然是回不去的，也许今生我是没办法回去了。不能看到妈妈，不能看到妹妹，我该怎么办呢？三十年，我们虽是同在一个地球上，我们虽是血肉情深，魂牵梦缠。可是，同胞竟不能相聚，不能团圆，甚至音信难通。千古以来，还有这样悲哀的事吗？
    当水陆空交通工具发达便利到穿太空上月球也不是什么困难的事时，我却不能回故乡！尤其当那些碧眼黄发的旅游者能登临我们的万里长城，能畅游我们的西子湖时，而我炎黄苗裔却不能，好憾好恨啊！为什么呢？到底为什么呢？……”
    真是“雁不至书成谁寄”！炽烈的思乡信，沉寂数十年，家人哪得知！三十年回乡之路，竟然寸步难移。在这悠悠岁月，相思相盼相念的家人纷纷溘然仙逝，梦魂杳然了！
    同窗好友写这封信之后，如今又过了十年，离家四十年了，她才能踏上故土，喝一杯故乡水，哭一声爹娘，叫一声亡弟。其感叹之情又岂是唐人的“乡音未改鬓毛摧”所能体味？！
    手捧书信，俯仰之间泪如雨下，情不能已，遂以《信笺》相邀。
    离家三十年的少年友伴这动人的家书，四十年后我始得见。信笺，飘载着她那万里相思的赤子之心，伴着游子泪，斑斑点点。说什么，万里长城不得登攀；说什么，西子湖水不得流连。真挚的塞上风，飘拂着它对游子的召唤；带着胡笳的音拍，只等归客束装，便响起‘喜相逢’的乐章。信笺的情怀吹皱一湖绿水，飘泛着西子的淡妆与浓抹。急盼游子兮，一睹芳菲；吟咏乡恋兮故人翘首，故土万里蜿蜒迎你，依然的风光潋滟迎你。故乡月分外明，“千里共婵娟”的那个婵娟也在注视着我们相会。何日浮槎乘风渡一水，了却“海上生明月，天涯共此时”的情牵怀念！
    信笺，染绿相思树，折柳系长条，依然郁郁葱葱，往日之依依，将拂去游子的憾恨。长城雄风将吹去你鬓边的霜寒，西湖之水已为你绿漪涨满。翘盼着一个归期的我的斗室，也已挑起窗帘，洞开门檐，红烛点燃，金樽酌满……
    归来哟！游子！
