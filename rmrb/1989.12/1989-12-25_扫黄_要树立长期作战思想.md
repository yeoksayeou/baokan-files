The campaign against pornography is a practical step in opposing bourgeois liberalization and is a serious political struggle against corruption and counter-revolution. Leading the people to decisively win this struggle is an important responsibility of party leaders at all levels.

Since July of this year, we have followed the series of directives and deployments from the Party Central Committee and the State Council to clean up the book, periodical, and audio-visual markets throughout the province. After several months of hard work, this task has achieved significant results. As of now, the province has inspected 315 printing plants, 1,995 audio-visual product sales points, 1,096 video rental points, 1,700 bookstall points, 129 bookstores, and 214 dance halls, covering 95% of the inspection area. We have confiscated 134,700 pornographic books, 35,900 illegal publications, 4,958 superstitious pictures and prints, 1,714 sets of obscene playing cards, 3,000 pornographic videotapes, and 12,535 illegal audio and video tapes. We have legally handled 38 cases involving pornography, including 10 major cases, uncovered 4 pornography trafficking gangs, and dealt with 276 lawbreakers. As a result, the cultural environment and market from cities to rural areas have been purified, and the people of the entire province have applauded, while the vast number of young people have received a profound education.

We have the following three insights:

Understanding the deep-seated causes of the spread of pornography and raising awareness of the campaign against it.

Our Party, in leading the people in revolution and construction, has an important task of establishing a new socialist culture. In recent years, some comrades have had a vague understanding of this, believing that with the policy of opening up and reform, all capitalist things can be allowed in. This is essentially a manifestation of a lack of vigilance against bourgeois decadent ideology. If we are not careful, what comes in will not just be a few flies, but the entire capitalist decadent ideology. This is the main reason for the spread of pornography. As ideological garbage, it has tenacity and cannot be eliminated with a few clean-ups. A large number of facts show that the spread of pornography is a mixture of external infiltration and domestic resurgence. In recent years, due to our weak ideological and political work and reduced revolutionary tradition education, there has been a lack of positive influences, which has greatly weakened the resistance of young people to decadent ideologies. Therefore, when pornographic and obscene things come in, there is a lack of effective resistance measures, and the younger generation lacks strong resistance and immunity, which greatly exacerbates the harm of pornography.

On the ideological and cultural front, some people are driven by profit and see the production and trafficking of pornographic materials as a way to make money, leading to the widespread dissemination of pornographic books and audio-visual products in society. Our efforts to combat pornography have been insufficient, with periods of action followed by inaction, without mobilizing the entire society to participate in the campaign against it, resulting in a relatively serious situation.

Conducting overall planning and concentrating the strength of the entire society for a decisive battle

Since July, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have made multiple arrangements and deployments for the campaign against pornography throughout the province, clearly outlining the methods, steps, and priorities of the struggle. Television, radio, newspapers, and other media have made the campaign against pornography a key focus of their propaganda. Public security, commerce, news and publishing, education, and other relevant departments have taken the lead in rectifying and cleaning up both within their organizations and in society. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other mass organizations have actively cooperated with relevant departments to participate in the campaign against pornography. Localities, prefectures, and cities have also taken action. Lanzhou City, following the provincial campaign against pornography publicity week, launched a month-long intensive campaign, seizing and sealing 170,000 banned books, destroying 30,000 pornographic books, confiscating 2,500 pornographic videotapes and audiotapes, handling 11 cases involving pornography, and dealing with 44 illegal book and periodical sales stalls and video rental points. Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture has dispatched 44 inspection teams totaling 1,500 people. Some regions have organized exhibitions of the results of the campaign against pornography. We have also invited National People's Congress representatives and provincial people's congress representatives to inspect and supervise the campaign against pornography in various cities and counties. Everyone has joined forces to form a powerful offensive. Now, the campaign against pornography in cities has penetrated into factories, schools, and neighborhoods, and in rural areas, it has penetrated into townships and village committees.

The campaign against pornography must be both decisive and cautious, and we must strictly adhere to and implement policies to prevent and avoid deviations. Our requirements in this regard are: in places where the masses have not yet been mobilized, we must emphasize "firmness" and resolutely overcome various obstacles to quickly form a campaign against pornography; in places where the masses have been mobilized, we must emphasize "caution" and strictly follow policies.

The campaign against pornography is extensive and large in scale, and we must both block the source and intercept the flow. In blocking the source and intercepting the flow, we focus on: first, various levels and types of publishing houses and magazines, clarifying the standards for what is considered pornographic, and conducting thorough inspections at every stage from editing, printing, to distribution; second, distribution channels, especially establishing a review system for postal services at all levels to block loopholes and prevent low-level vulgar publications from being distributed through the postal system; third, bookstores at all levels, which are not allowed to purchase unhealthy books from other regions; fourth, collective and individual wholesalers, who, for the purpose of making money, purchase large quantities of pornographic books from other regions and distribute them throughout the province, will be firmly shut down without mercy; fifth, commercial management, which will severely punish, according to law, illegal elements who do not have commercial registrations or operate without a license, secretly trading obscene and vulgar books and periodicals from coastal areas and other provinces; sixth, underground screening points, whether they are state-owned units and enterprises or collective or individual screening points, all screening points that screen, duplicate, and spread pornographic video products will be shut down.

The campaign against pornography must be carried out deeply and persistently to effectively solve problems. Fundamentally, it is necessary to use healthy and popular artistic works to occupy the ideological and cultural front. Our provincial and municipal cultural markets and professional art troupes, through the campaign against pornography and rectification, have become more determined in their direction of serving the people and socialism. Our provincial folk and traditional art exhibition, the opera "Caizhi Tianya," and other programs participated in the second national art festival. Lanzhou's Taiping Drum participated in the Chengdu Folk Art Festival. The television series "Western Light," "Looking West," and the co-produced "Western Voice" by Gansu Television Station have all received praise from both inside and outside the province. The province has published over 300 new books totaling 40 million copies, reprinted 91 books totaling 8 million copies. In the provincial and municipal "Silk Road Cup" television art grand prize competition, 17 outstanding programs were selected from 154 entries, compiled into a television program, and received the welcome of the people. The entire province has published over 300 new books totaling 40 million copies, reprinted 91 books totaling 8 million copies.

Popularizing the awareness of the campaign against pornography and establishing a long-term combat mindset

The initial phase of the campaign against pornography has been successful, but the tasks ahead are still arduous and long-term. In this regard, we must be fully prepared and must adopt a long-term combat mindset.

From the current situation in Gansu, the struggle has characteristics of recurrence, concealment, and transfer. If we tighten our grip, the market will be cleaner, but if we relax even slightly, new problems will emerge. Some illegal book peddlers, bookstores, and sellers of pornographic products have superficially restrained their activities, but their methods have become more concealed and secretive. Some bookstalls have different displays during the day and night, above and below the stall, and in public and private. At the same time, there is a transfer of pornographic books from cities to rural areas, and from daytime markets to night markets and black markets. We are currently working on drafting local regulations for the management of the cultural market, including the "Gansu Province Cultural Market Management Regulations" and the "Gansu Province Audio-Visual Publication Market Management Regulations," gradually bringing the management of audio-visual product markets, book and periodical markets, and the printing industry into the legal track.

    “扫黄”要树立长期作战思想
    中共甘肃省委书记　李子奇
    “扫黄”是反对资产阶级自由化的一个实际步骤，是一场腐蚀与反腐蚀、演变与反演变的严峻政治斗争。坚决地领导人民群众夺取这场斗争的胜利，是各级党的领导者的重要职责。
    从今年7月以来，我们遵照党中央和国务院的一系列指示和部署，在全省范围内清理了图书报刊及音像市场。经过几个月的艰苦努力，这项工作已取得了明显成效。截至目前，全省清查印刷厂315家，音像制品销售点1995个，放像点1096个，书贩摊点1700个，书店129家，舞厅214个，清查面占95％，查缴色情淫秽书刊134700多册，非法出版书刊35900册，迷信图片、印刷品4958张（册），淫秽扑克1714副，色情淫秽录像带3000多盘，非法录音、录像带12535盘；依法查办“涉黄”案件38起，其中大要案10起，挖出贩黄团伙4个，处理违法犯罪分子276人。这样做的结果，从城市到农村，文化环境和市场得到了净化，全省人民拍手称快，广大青少年受到了深刻教育。
    我们有以下三点体会：
    弄清产生“黄毒”的深层原因，提高“扫黄”斗争的自觉性。
    我们党领导人民进行革命和建设，一项重要的任务，是建立社会主义新文化。对黄色淫秽腐朽的东西，近几年有些同志思想上有模糊认识，认为开放搞活，资本主义的东西统统都可以放进来。这实质上是对资产阶级腐朽思想丧失警惕性的表现。稍有疏忽，放进来的就不仅仅是几个苍蝇，而是资本主义腐朽意识形态。这是“黄毒”泛滥最主要的原因。作为意识形态的垃圾，有其顽固性，不是靠几次清理就能一劳永逸的。大量的事实说明，“黄毒”的泛滥，是外来渗透和国内的沉渣泛起的混合物。这几年，由于我们思想政治工作薄弱，革命传统教育减少，正面的东西不多，使青少年对于腐朽思想的抵抗力大为减弱。所以，当黄色淫秽的东西袭来的时候，缺乏有力的抵制措施，青少年一代更缺乏强有力的抵抗力和免疫力，这就必然大大加剧了“黄毒”的危害程度。
    在思想文化阵地上，一些人见利忘义，视“制黄”、“贩黄”为发财之道，黄色书刊和音像制品在社会广为流传。我们对黄色的东西打击不力，打一阵、停一阵，没有动员全社会的力量开展“扫黄”斗争，以致造成比较严重的局面。
    进行总体部署，集中全社会力量进行围歼
    今年七月份以来，我们省委、省政府对全省的“扫黄”斗争，进行过多次安排和部署，对斗争的方法、步骤、重点提出了明确要求，电视、广播、报纸等舆论工具都把“扫黄”作为宣传重点，公安、工商、新闻出版、教育等有关部门，按照自己的分工职责，带头搞好内部及社会上的整顿清理；工会、共青团等群众团体，主动配合有关部门，投入“扫黄”工作。各地、州、市也普遍行动起来。兰州市在全省“扫黄”宣传周后，开展了“扫黄”突击月活动，已经收缴封存违禁书刊17万册，销毁淫秽黄色书刊3万多册，没收黄色录像、录音带2500多盘，查处涉黄案件11起，处理违法经营书报、销售摊点和录像放映点44处。临夏回族自治州先后出动检查组44个，检查人员1500多人。有些地区组织了“扫黄”成果展览。我们还邀请全国人大代表和省人大代表，到一些地市县检查、督促“扫黄”。上下左右一起动手，形成了强大的攻势。现在，“扫黄”斗争在城市已深入到厂矿、学校、街道，在农村已深入到乡镇和村民委员会。
    “扫黄”工作既要坚决，又要稳妥，必须认真掌握和执行政策，防止和避免出现偏差。我们在这方面的要求是：群众还没有发动起来的地方，要多讲些“坚定”，坚决克服各种阻力，尽快形成“扫黄”局面；群众已经发动起来的地方，多讲些“稳妥”，严格按政策办事。
    “扫黄”斗争面广量大，既要堵源，又要截流。我们在堵源截流中，一抓各级各类出版社、杂志社，搞清“黄”的标准，从编、印、发各环节上彻底检查；二抓发行渠道，特别是对各级邮局建立审读制度，堵塞漏洞，使一批低级庸俗的刊物不能从邮局传入；三抓各级新华书店，不得从外地购进不健康的图书；四抓集体、个体批发户，对以赚钱为目的、从外地大批购进黄色书刊、又批发到全省各地的集体、个体批发户，毫不手软，坚决取缔。五抓工商管理，对一些没有工商登记、也不挂牌经营，偷偷摸摸从沿海和外省转手倒卖淫秽下流书报刊的不法分子，依法严厉制裁。六抓地下放映点，不管是国营单位和企业，也不管是集体或个人的放映点，凡是播放、复制、传播黄色录像制品的，全部取缔。
    “扫黄”工作要深入持久地进行下去，切实解决问题，从根本上说还是要用健康的、群众喜闻乐见的文艺作品去占领思想文化阵地。我省省市两级文化市场和专业文艺团体，经过
  “扫黄”斗争，经过清理整顿，更加坚定了文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向。我省民间民俗美术展览，歌剧《咫尺天涯》等节目，参加了全国第二届艺术节，兰州太平鼓参加了蓉城民间艺术节。甘肃电视台拍摄的《西部之光》、《西北望》及合拍的《西部之声》等电视片都受到了省内外的好评。全省已出版新书300多种，4000多万册，重版图书91种，800多万册。全省工交企业“丝路杯”电视文艺大奖赛上，从154个节目中，选出17个优秀节目，编制了电视片，受到了人民群众的欢迎。
    普及全民“扫黄”意识，树立长期作战思想
    “扫黄”斗争初战告捷，但面临的任务仍然是艰巨和长期的。在这一点上，我们要有充分的思想准备，必须进行长期作战。
    从甘肃目前实际看，斗争有反复性、隐蔽性、转移性。抓得紧一些，市场就干净一些，稍有松懈，就会冒出新的问题。一些不法书贩、书店、贩卖黄色制品的活动，表面上有所收敛，但手法更隐蔽、更诡秘，有的书摊白天和晚上不一样，摊上和摊下不一样，表面和背地不一样。同时，还有黄色的书刊由城市向农村转移，由白天向夜市、黑市转移。我们正在抓紧制定文化市场管理的地方性法规，草拟了《甘肃省文化市场管理条例》、《甘肃省音像出版物市场管理规定》等法规，逐步使音像制品市场、图书报刊市场，印刷行业等方面的管理有法可依、有章可循，纳入法制轨道。
