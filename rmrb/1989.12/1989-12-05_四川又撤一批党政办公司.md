    Sichuan Cancels Another Batch of Party and Government-Run Companies
    Our reporter Luomocheng reports from Chengdu: Recently, with the approval of relevant departments in Sichuan Province, in addition to the 46 companies that have already been canceled, another 82 companies under provincial-level state organs and directly-affiliated public institutions have been canceled.

    Among the 82 companies decided to be canceled this time, there are 58 companies under 21 government agencies of Sichuan Province, and 12 companies under 4 party and mass organizations at the provincial level. The companies decided to be canceled this time are mainly those that are redundantly set up or exist in name only, or have chaotic management and severe losses, or use the guise of affiliation to "pull rank" and "use the tiger's skin as a flag," with the supervising departments unable to control them.

    The cancellation of these companies will not encounter significant difficulties in handling assets, rights, debts, and personnel arrangements, and will have a relatively small impact, avoiding the creation of new instability.

    四川又撤一批党政办公司
    本报成都12月4日电　记者罗茂城报道：最近，经四川省有关领导部门批准，省级国家机关及直属事业单位在原已撤销46个公司的基础上，再次撤销82个公司。
    这次决定撤销的82个公司中有四川省政府21个机关单位的58个公司，省级党群系统4个机关单位的12个公司。决定撤销的这批公司，主要是一些重复设置或空有其名，或经营管理混乱、亏损严重，或者以挂靠为名、“拉大旗作虎皮”、主管部门控制不了的公司。
    被撤销的这些公司，在资产、债权、债务处理和人员安排等方面难度不很大，牵动面较小，不会造成新的不安定因素。
