The Dabie Mountains, which have been relatively impoverished since the founding of the People's Republic, have seen a significant increase in economic strength after four years of poverty alleviation work.

According to inspections and verifications conducted by the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, after just four years of poverty alleviation efforts, 434 million out of the 482 million people who were still struggling to meet basic food needs in the 18 key impoverished counties of the Dabie Mountains have had their food needs met, accounting for 90.26%. As their living standards improve, they have begun to invest more of their savings into expanding production and improving production methods, continually exploring new areas of production.

Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian attended the Fourth Economic Development Conference for Impoverished Counties in the Dabie Mountains held today. He said that the achievements in poverty alleviation in the Dabie Mountains demonstrate that the economic revitalization of impoverished regions must steadfastly follow the path of relying on scientific and technological progress. Without transitioning from traditional, closed, and backward natural economies to modern commodity economies supported by science and technology, the working people cannot escape poverty and become prosperous, and agricultural modernization cannot be achieved—this is a conclusion of universal significance drawn from the poverty alleviation work in the Dabie Mountains over the past few years.

The renowned revolutionary base area of Hubei Province, Hong'an County, has seen an all-around bumper harvest this year, with a grain output of 285 million kilograms, setting a historical high. The per capita grain possession in the county is 493.5 kilograms, and the average household has 1.75 pigs. Chen Junsheng, a member of the State Council, who is currently conducting an investigation here, believes that this achievement is remarkable in impoverished regions.

Hong'an County, which has lost 140,000 of its children to the Chinese revolution, has long been economically backward due to natural and historical reasons. In 1986, it was designated by the State Council as a key county for poverty alleviation support. Following the State Council's policy of shifting from relief-based poverty alleviation to development-based poverty alleviation, Hong'an County allocated two-thirds of the 328.5 million yuan in poverty alleviation construction funds to livestock breeding, planting, and improving agricultural production conditions, with the remainder used for township enterprises and industrial development related to agricultural development.

Four years of arduous poverty alleviation and development have laid a solid foundation for this year's bumper harvest. Compared to 1985, this year's total grain production increased by 7%, oilseeds by 12%, tobacco leaves by 2.5 times, tea leaves by 47%, township enterprise output value by 3 times, and per capita income of farmers by 138 yuan, reaching 403 yuan. 94% of the impoverished households have basically solved their food problems.

Chen Junsheng believes that achieving nearly 500 kilograms of grain per capita and 1.75 pigs per household in impoverished regions is a remarkable feat. Hong'an has embarked on a virtuous cycle of "oilseeds—pigs—grain."

    大别山科技脱贫结硕果
    红安县开发致富传佳音
    宋健陈俊生称赞这两个地方走出脱贫新路
    本报南阳12月11日讯　记者谢联辉报道：建国以来一直比较贫困的大别山区，经过4年的扶贫工作，经济实力明显增强。
    据河南、湖北、安徽三省的检查验收，经过短短4年的扶贫工作，在整个大别山18个重点贫困县扶贫前尚未解决温饱的482万人中，已有434万人解决温饱问题，占90.26％。他们在生活水平得到改善的同时，已经开始将更多的积累用于扩大再生产和改进生产手段，不断开辟新的生产领域。
    国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健出席了今天在这里召开的第四次大别山贫困县经济开发会议。他说，大别山地区扶贫工作成绩表明，贫困地区的经济振兴，必须坚定不移地走依靠科技进步的道路。没有从传统的、封闭的、落后的自然经济向以现代科学技术为支柱的商品经济的转变，劳动人民就不可能脱贫致富，农业的现代化就不可能实现——这就是大别山地区前几年扶贫工作中一条最有普遍意义的结论。
    本报红安12月11日电　记者陈健报道：著名老区湖北省红安县今年农业全面丰收，粮食产量达2.85亿公斤，创历史最高水平。全县人均占有粮食493.5公斤，户均生猪1.75头。正在这里调查的国务委员陈俊生认为这个成绩在贫困地区十分了不起。
    曾有14万儿女为中国革命献出生命的红安县，由于自然和历史原因，经济长期处于落后状态，1986年被国务院定为重点扶持的贫困县。红安县遵照国务院确立的改救济式扶贫为开发式扶贫的方针，将3285万元扶贫建设资金的2／3用于养殖业、种植业开发和改善农业生产条件，其余用于与农业开发有关的乡镇企业和工业开发。
    四年艰苦的扶贫开发为今年的农业丰收打下了坚实的基础。与1985年相比，今年粮食总产增长7％，油料增长12％，烟叶增长2.5倍，茶叶增长47％，乡镇企业产值增长3倍，农民人均收入增长138元，达到403元。94％的特困户基本解决了温饱问题。
    陈俊生认为，在贫困地区实现人均近500公斤粮和户均1.75头猪是非常了不起的事情，红安已经走上了“油料—生猪—粮食”的良性循环。
