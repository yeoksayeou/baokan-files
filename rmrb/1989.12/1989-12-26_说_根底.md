Title: On "Foundations"

In the late autumn, I traveled to Shijiazhuang and, together with friends, visited Zhengding. Zhengding, Cangzhou Lion, Dingzhou Iron Pagoda, and Anji Bridge are collectively known as the "Four Treasures of Hebei." Upon arriving in Zhengding, we naturally went to see the giant Buddha at Longxing Temple.

Indeed, it lived up to its reputation. Inside the main building of Longxing Temple, the Dabei Hall, this copper statue of the Bodhisattva stands at 21.7 meters tall, like a giant standing before tens of thousands of visitors. It is adorned in a golden-yellow robe, with a harmonious overall proportion and elegant lines. Standing barefoot on an inverted lotus throne, it exudes an aura of great compassion. The statue has forty-two hands, each holding various objects such as the sun, moon, stars, bells, staffs, and bowls, hence the common name "Thousand-Armed, Thousand-Eyed Guanyin." Standing before this tall and majestic Buddha statue, I thought about how it was cast from molten bronze, and I couldn't help but admire its foundation. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the foundation of this Buddha, built during the Northern Song Dynasty, was indeed very solid. Before casting the giant Buddha, the craftsmen first dug a pit fifteen meters square, digging down to the groundwater. They then layered gravel, soil, and lime, compacting each layer. They continued this process until they were two meters below the surface, at which point they left a twelve-meter square "sea" and planted seven iron pillars the thickness of a basin. They then filled the pit with molten iron. This underground work, unseen by people today, silently bears the entire weight of the Buddha, ensuring that despite experiencing a thousand years of wind and rain, the Buddha remains "unmoved by wind and rain, as stable as a mountain." This unseen underground work is the true foundation of the Buddha.

The foundation refers to the basis or stance. Comrade Mao Zedong once quoted a couplet that said, "Reeds on the wall, top-heavy and root-shallow; bamboo shoots in the mountains, sharp-mouthed and hollow inside," which speaks to this foundation. Consider, how deep can the roots of reeds growing on a wall be? Top-heavy and foot-light, swaying with the wind is only natural. Comrade Mao Zedong also said, "A hundred-foot tower starts with a single stone.... Scholarship is the same. Today, record one event, tomorrow understand one principle, and over time, it becomes knowledge" (Mao Zedong and Poetry, by Zhang Yijiu, published by Chunqiu Press in 1987, page 110). Scholarship requires a foundation. In life, doesn't one also need such a solid foundation?

The road of life is rugged and winding. Everyone knows there are no straight paths in the world, and everyone knows to advise others to prepare for a winding road. However, when setbacks and twists suddenly appear before one's eyes, many people often find themselves at a loss when their swift progress is abruptly halted. How many can, like Comrade Mao Zedong, sigh and pursue, "The sea is turbulent, what is there to worry about? The world is chaotic, what is there to reason about. Just manage your own body and mind, and your heart will always be beautiful and new" (Mao Zedong and Poetry, page 114)? This "confidence" is not something that falls from the sky, nor is it something innate in the human brain. This "confidence" comes from a deep foundation. This "confidence" of a "hundred-foot tower" starts with a single stone! With such a foundation, or without it, one's stance often differs greatly when encountering storms and twists. Some of our comrades often jump from one extreme to another in their understanding and work, swaying between various one-sided views. This is because their stance, their foundation, is not stable or deep. Many young people, in questions such as how to view the meaning of life, how to view the superiority of the socialist system, how to view Western lifestyles and material enjoyment, and how to view imperialism's strategy of "peaceful evolution," cannot distinguish right from wrong and are, to varying degrees, influenced by the bourgeois liberalization trend. Some even stand on the side of the turmoil. Ultimately, this is because they lack a deep foundation or have no foundation at all or almost no foundation. The principles they believe in are "people follow the tide, grass follows the wind," and they do not even talk about principles. They do not conduct investigations and research, do not grasp firsthand materials, do not analyze the essence of problems, and are only accustomed to making comparisons and conclusions based on surface phenomena. Some even think that only they are the "elite" of the nation today and the saviors of the world. Their arrogance and ignorance are laughable. How can one do without a foundation for even a moment?

So, what is the foundation of a person? I believe it is the basic principles of Marxism. Without the basic principles of Marxism, we lose our foundation, and our hundred-foot tower is like a tower built on sand. Harsh practice has once again proven that studying and researching Marxist theory has urgent practical significance.

    说“根底”
    王向东
    深秋季节到石家庄，与朋友们一起到正定一游。正定大佛沧州狮，定州铁塔安济桥，俗称“河北四宝”。到了正定，当然要去看看隆兴寺的大佛。
    果然名不虚传。在隆兴寺主体建筑大悲阁内，这座菩萨铜像高二十一点七米，恰如一位巨人屹立在成千上万的游客面前。他身披金黄色袈裟，整体比例适当，线条明朗优美，赤足立于仰覆莲花宝座之上，给人以大慈大悲的感觉。佛像有四十二只手，分持日月星辰钟鼓杖钵诸物，因而俗称“千手千眼观音”。站在这座高大雄伟的佛像面前，想到它是用铜水浇铸而成，我不禁对它的“根底”另眼相看起来。一打听，原来这座建于北宋年间的大佛脚下，倒是有着十分坚实的“根底”呢！铸大佛之前，工匠们首先开挖了一个十五米见方的地坑，一直向下深挖至地泉，然后用一重砾石、一重土、一重石灰混和起来，一层一层夯实。直夯到离地面还有两米深时，才留下一个十二米见方的“海子”，在“海子”内栽了七条碗口粗的熟铁柱，再用铁水注满地坑。这个今天人们看不到的地下工程，默默地承受着大佛的全部重量，使大佛虽然经历了千百年的风雨，却一直是“风雨不动安如山”。这个今天人们看不到的地下工程，就是大佛真正的“根底”。
    根底者，即所谓立场基础也。毛泽东同志曾经引用过一副对联，说是“墙上芦苇，头重脚轻根底浅；山间竹笋，嘴尖皮厚腹中空”，就说到了这个“根底”。试想，芦苇而生之于墙头，能有多深的根底？头重脚轻随风摇摆当是自然之势。毛泽东同志又说：“百丈之台，其始则一石耳，……学问亦然。今日记一事，明日悟一理，积久而成学”（《毛泽东和诗》，张贻玖著，春秋出版社1987年版，第110页）。治学要有“根底”。做人，不也要有这样厚厚实实的“根底”么？
    人生的道路，崎岖而曲折。谁都知道世界上没有直路，都知道劝人准备走曲折的路。然而，一旦当挫折和曲折突然地出现在自己眼前的时候，许多人就常常为自己的健步如飞被突然中断而手足无措，又有几人能够像毛泽东同志那样发出“沧海横流安足虑，世事纷纭何足理。管却自家身与心，胸中日月常新美”（《送纵宇一郎东行》）的慨叹和追求！“自信人生二百年，会当击水三千里”（《毛泽东和诗》，第114页），这“自信”不是天上掉下来的，也不是人脑里固有的。这“自信”来自深厚的“根底”，这“自信”的“百丈之台”，“其始则一石耳”！有这样的“根底”，还是没有这样的“根底”，一遇风波和曲折，立场表现往往截然相反。我们一些同志在认识上和工作中往往从一个极端跳到另一个极端，在这样那样的片面性之间摇来摆去，就是吃的立场这个根底不稳不深的亏。许多青年人在如何看待人生的意义，如何看待社会主义制度的优越性，如何看待西方的生活方式和物质享受，如何看待帝国主义“和平演变”的战略等等问题上，所以分不清是非，程度不同地受到资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，有的人甚至站到动乱一边去了，归根到底，也是吃的这个根底不深甚至没有根底或者几乎没有根底的亏。他们信奉的原则，是“人随潮流草随风”，根本谈不上什么原则不原则。他们不搞调查研究，不掌握第一手资料，不分析问题的本质，只习惯于从表面现象上乱作对比乱下结论。有的人甚至以为只有自己才是当今民族的“精英”，才是当今世界的救世主。其狂妄无知，令人啼笑皆非。“根底”之于人，岂可须臾或缺？
    那么，做人的“根底”何在？我以为就是马克思主义基本原理。离开了马克思主义基本原理，我们就失去了自己的“根底”，我们的百丈之台就犹如沙上之塔。严酷的实践又一次证明，学习和研究马克思主义理论，具有紧迫的现实意义。
