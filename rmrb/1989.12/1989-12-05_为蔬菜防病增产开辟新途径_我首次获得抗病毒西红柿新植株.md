	For vegetables disease prevention and increased yield open new pathways

	China successfully develops virus-resistant tomato plants

	BEIJING, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) — Chinese scientists have made a significant breakthrough in plant genetic engineering. Researchers at the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have successfully transferred the gene for resistance to cucumber mosaic virus into tomatoes, creating a new strain of tomatoes with inherited resistance to the virus. This achievement was officially recognized today by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	Cucumber mosaic virus is one of the most destructive viruses affecting vegetable production, infecting over 700 plant species and severely impacting vegetable growth. It is often referred to as the "cancer" of plants and has long been considered incurable. In 1987, researchers at the Institute of Microbiology, including Tian Bo, artificially synthesized the single and double genes of the cucumber mosaic virus's ribonucleic acid and transferred them into the chromosomes of tomato cells, resulting in genetically engineered plants with resistance to the virus. These plants can stably pass on their resistance to future generations. Tomato seedlings grown from these genetically engineered plants have overcome the widespread summer die-off caused by viral infections, showing great potential for disease prevention and increased yield.

	Experts who participated in the evaluation believe that this groundbreaking research demonstrates the promising prospects of using biotechnology to prevent diseases and increase yields in vegetables, which will have significant economic benefits.

    为蔬菜防病增产开辟新途径
    我首次获得抗病毒西红柿新植株
    本报北京12月4日讯　新华社记者王旭、本报记者许正中报道：我国植物基因工程研究获得重大突破。中国科学院微生物研究所的科研人员，成功地将抗黄瓜花叶病毒基因转入西红柿中，首次得到具有抗病毒遗传性能的西红柿新株系。这一成果今天通过了中国科学院的鉴定。
    黄瓜花叶病毒是蔬菜生产中危害最烈的一种病毒，能感染700多种植物，严重影响蔬菜生长，有植物“癌症”之称，长期找不到根治办法。1987年，中国科学院微生物研究所田波等科研人员人工合成了黄瓜花叶病毒核糖核酸的单体基因和双体基因，再将其转移到西红柿细胞核染色体上，获得了具有抗病性的基因工程植株。这些植株能将抗病性稳定地遗传下去。用这种基因工程植株选育出的西红柿苗，克服了过去由病毒感染引起的西红柿夏季大面积枯死现象，具有防病增产潜力。
    参加鉴定的专家认为，这项突破性的研究成果，展示了我国运用生物工程技术使蔬菜防病增产的诱人前景，将产生十分可观的经济效益。
