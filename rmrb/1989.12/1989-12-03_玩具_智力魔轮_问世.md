A toy called the "Intelligence Magic Wheel," which combines knowledge and entertainment, has recently been launched by the Beijing Yunhai Company.

This "Intelligence Magic Wheel," designed and manufactured based on a domestic patent, consists of a calculation tube and 37 number and symbol wheels. By assembling and disassembling these components, it can perform 567 arithmetic problems, making abstract mathematical concepts vivid for children.

At a time when the market is flooded with imported toys labeled "Made in the USA" and "Made in Japan," the "Intelligence Magic Wheel" has caught the attention of toy industry experts. At the recent Shijiazhuang National Department Store Commodity Exchange Fair, orders for the Intelligence Magic Wheel exceeded 60,000 sets.

Experts in Beijing believe that this toy, developed and manufactured entirely domestically, has a low cost and strong market competitiveness.

    玩具“智力魔轮”问世
    新华社北京12月1日电  一种集知识性趣味性为一体的教具式智力开发型玩具最近由北京运海公司推出。
    这种根据国内专利设计研制的“智力魔轮”，由一个演算筒、37个数轮和符号轮组成，通过拆装组合进行演算，可以演算567道运算题，把抽象的数学概念形象地展现在儿童面前。
    在目前各种标有“美国制造”、“日本制造”的进口玩具充斥市场的情况下，“智力魔轮”已引起玩具界行家的注意。在刚刚结束的石家庄全国百货商品交流会上，智力魔轮订购超过6万套。
    北京的一些专家认为，这种玩具完全由国内研制开发，成本低，市场竞争力强。
