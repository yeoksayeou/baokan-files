**Editor's Note:** What does the revitalization and development of a country, a region, a department, or even a company rely on? After years of serious thought, research, and exploration, and after summarizing a large amount of practical experience and lessons, a new understanding has taken shape in people's minds—rely on science and technology. This is the reason why, over a period of time, slogans such as "Science and Technology for Provincial Development," "Science and Technology for Urban Development," "Science and Technology for County Development," "Science and Technology for Agriculture," and "Science and Technology for Industry" have been repeatedly proposed. All of these are manifestations and implementations of the grand strategy of "Science and Technology for National Development" in different fields and levels. To explore methods in this regard and to exchange experiences, this newspaper will start a "Science and Technology Light" column today, welcoming letters and articles from leaders at all levels, experts, scholars, and comrades with practical experience in this area to express their opinions, seeking collective wisdom to better rely on technological progress and promote the development of China's socialist cause.

	Implementing "Science and Technology for Urban Development" to revitalize Changchun's economy—this strategic policy is becoming a conscious action for people from all walks of life in Changchun.

	Last year, the city achieved three breakthroughs for the first time: the total industrial output value exceeded 10 billion yuan, the total grain production exceeded 10 billion jin, and the fiscal revenue exceeded 1 billion yuan. People say that science and technology played a crucial role here.

	A Wise Choice

	In December 1987, during the coldest season in Northeast China, the atmosphere in the meeting room of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was heated, with continuous speeches. The central topic of discussion was how to boost Changchun's economy.

	Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Changchun's economic construction has made significant progress, but compared to some developed cities in the country, there is still a noticeable gap. According to the "China Economic Yearbook," in 1987, Changchun ranked among the lower echelons in terms of both national income and social production value among 15 central cities; the total industrial output value ranked sixth in Northeast China.

	How to achieve a significant development in Changchun's economic construction? Starting from the analysis of the city's situation, everyone discussed and gradually reached a consensus. Changchun has a poor fiscal situation and cannot rely on high investment to expand reproduction; mineral resources have just been developed, and it is not possible to increase benefits by developing raw material industries. However, Changchun has a unique advantage in science and technology, and it is completely possible to rely on "scientific and technological investment" to produce more grain and agricultural products on limited arable land; to optimize the product structure on the existing industrial base and improve economic benefits.

	It was at this plenary session that the idea of relying on science and technology for urban development and revitalizing Changchun's economy began to take shape.

	The following April, at the Seventh Session of the Municipal Party Congress, the strategic thought of "relying on science and technology for urban development, strengthening leading industries, consolidating the agricultural foundation, accelerating opening up, enhancing urban functions, and promoting urban-rural integration" was formally proposed for Changchun's economic development.

	The choice of "Science and Technology for Urban Development" stirred up waves throughout the city. Government agencies, factories, research institutes, colleges and universities... from top to bottom, in all aspects, a discussion on "Science and Technology for Urban Development" was launched. The central topic of the discussion was how to contribute more to science and technology for urban development.

	Various counties (cities) and districts also proposed the slogans of "Science and Technology for County Development" and "Science and Technology for District Development"; "Science and Technology for Enterprises" and "Science and Technology for Agriculture" spread like a spring breeze into factories and villages.

	Newspapers, radio stations, and television stations allocated important columns and "prime time" to set up special columns and topics to create public opinion for science and technology for urban development.

	From then on, this young city of Changchun began to spread its wings and soar with the power of science and technology.

	Potential Advantages Are Turning into Real Advantages

	The "Changchun Yearbook" records: "In 1987, the city had 99 independent natural science and social science institutions (including 78 natural science research institutions), and 26 colleges and universities. There were more than 220,000 scientific and technical personnel of various types." Whether it is the number of research institutions and colleges and universities or the number of scientific and technical personnel, Changchun ranks among the top in the 15 major cities in the country. These advantages have long been in a potential state.

	The proposal of the strategic thought of science and technology for urban development and the introduction of relevant policies for relying on technological progress have activated the enthusiasm of research institutions, colleges and universities, and scientific and technical personnel to face economic construction, accelerating the process of science and technology serving the economy, and gradually turning potential scientific and technological advantages into economic advantages.

	In the past, it was like "the peacock flying to the southeast," but now the "peacock" does not fly or returns. Several scientific and technical personnel from a certain research institute had already prepared application reports to go to a certain place in the south. After the mobilization meeting for science and technology for urban development, they were inspired by the policy and withdrew the application, determined to contribute their wisdom to the revitalization of Changchun's economy.

	In the past, scientific and technological services were done secretly and dared not "show their faces," but now they go to enterprises to apply for part-time jobs openly and confidently. According to incomplete statistics, over the past year, more than 4,400 scientific and technical personnel have worked in various ways in medium and small enterprises and township enterprises, injecting vitality into the technological progress of enterprises.

	A large number of scientific and technical personnel no longer eat "imperial rations," no longer hold "iron rice bowls," and do not spend a single cent of the state's money. Based on the principle of "four selfs" (self-raising funds, voluntary combination, self-management, and self-responsibility for profits and losses), they have established various private scientific research institutions. The number of private scientific and technological institutions in the city has increased to 349, an increase of more than 200 compared to 1987, becoming an important scientific and technological force that cannot be ignored.

	The cooperation between research institutions and enterprises is becoming closer, and it is gradually developing from a single technology transfer and temporary technical cooperation to a long-term, stable technical union. Over the past year, the number of scientific research and production unions in the city has increased to 77, with a production value of 72.456 million yuan and taxes and profits of 13.724 million yuan.

	The "Relying" Consciousness Is Becoming Stronger

	The key to relying on technological progress is in the enterprises. This is a very clear idea in Changchun's implementation of science and technology for urban development.

	The proposal of the strategic thought of science and technology for urban development has shaken the hearts of enterprise managers. They began to realize that enterprises can only stand firm in the rapidly changing market competition by relying on science and technology and taking the path of "internal" development of production.

	The Changchun Gear Factory, which has a joint venture with FAW, has been following others for several years without its own standardized products, and life was tough. In the implementation of the "Science and Technology for Urban Development" strategy, the factory relied on science and technology to enhance the enterprise's momentum. The CAS5-20 gearbox they jointly developed with the FAW Research Institute has the advantages of five-speed synchronizers, light and flexible operation, and fuel efficiency, reaching the international level of the early 1980s. Last year, the factory achieved a profit and tax of more than 600 million yuan, becoming one of the richest enterprises in Changchun.

	Over the past year, the 874 new products put into production by industrial enterprises in the city have achieved a production value of 6.8 billion yuan and a profit and tax of 1.19 billion yuan. The city has 236 new products that have reached the domestic advanced level; 14 new products have reached or approached the international advanced level. Three products won national gold and silver awards, 25 products won department-level quality awards, 80 products won provincial quality awards, and 283 new products won provincial excellent new product awards.

	Relying on technological progress, enterprises have achieved a large-scale harvest.

	Science and Technology for Agriculture Is Thriving

	In May last year, Dehui County organized county and township leaders to inspect work in a certain village. Coincidentally, a county agricultural technician also went along. Upon arriving at the village, the villagers seemed to pay little attention to the arrival of the officials, but they were unusually enthusiastic about this agricultural technician, pulling families and dragging relatives, insisting on inviting him to have a meal at home. The officials left after inspecting the work, but this agricultural technician could not leave, and was forced to stay in the village.

	Indeed, in the hearts of the broad masses of farmers who have tasted the sweetness of science and technology for wealth, the concept of "officials" is fading, and the word "science and technology" is appreciating. Listen to the words of Xu Fengshan, the Party Secretary of Dapu Town, Yushu County:

	"In the past, village officials just had to sing the four-season song of 'singing in the spring, planting in the summer, harvesting in the autumn, and delivering grain in the winter.' Now this set of songs is no longer effective. Officials who do not understand technology cannot command farmers, and they may even be examined by farmers."

	The suburban area of Changchun, which started relying on science and technology for agriculture relatively early, has its own set of methods. This district started last year, using three methods of enlightenment education, popularization education, and advanced education, to classify and queue up all farmers in the district, and teach them according to their abilities. The coverage rate of adult training reached 70%. Scientific and technological training has given farmers the wings to get rich, and the district has seen the emergence of more than 17,000 specialized households in poultry, vegetables, grapes, and other fields. Last year, the district's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by nearly 200% compared to 1983.

	Singing the Song of Science and Technology for Urban Development Together

	Science and technology for urban development requires a "grand chorus," not a "one-man show." This is another commendable feature of Changchun in its science and technology for urban development.

	The Municipal Taxation Bureau has consciously transformed its functions and acted as a "catalyst" in the work of connecting scientific research with production, actively playing the role of a "matchmaker." In the past two years, it has provided tax support for 1,169 enterprises for technological transformation, new product development, and result transfer.

	The Business Department of the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bank has fully played the role of a financial intermediary, using the advantage of funds to promote the combination of scientific research and production. Last year, it issued loans totaling 165.43 million yuan for enterprises' technological transformation and new product development, resulting in an increase of 527.8 million yuan in production value and 61.9 million yuan in taxes and profits for enterprises.

	The Municipal Political Consultative Conference and the Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese have paid attention to playing the role of a comprehensive talent pool, organizing scientific and technical personnel to visit and investigate enterprises and villages multiple times, providing consultation and services.

	Currently, the situation of all levels and industries in the city revolving around science and technology for urban development and singing the song of science and technology for urban development together is beginning to take shape.

    一石激起千层浪
    ——长春市“科技立市”扫描
    郭振昌　翟述华　唐晓明　杨凤义
    编者按：一个国家、一个地区、一个部门、乃至一个企业的振兴和发展靠什么？人们经过多年来的认真思考、研究和探索，在总结大量的实践经验和教训之后，一个新的认识在头脑中形成——依靠科学技术。这正是一段时间以来，科技兴省、科技兴市、科技兴县、科技兴农、科技兴业……的战略口号不断提出的原因所在。所有这些，又都是科技兴国这个大战略在不同领域和层次上的体现和落实。为了探索这方面的做法，交流这方面的经验，本报从今天起辟《科技之光》专栏，欢迎各级领导、专家学者和有这方面实践经验的同志来函来稿，发表意见，以求集思广益，更好地依靠科技进步，推进我国社会主义事业的发展。
    实施“科技立市”，振兴长春经济——这一战略方针正在成为长春市各界人士的自觉行动。
    去年，这个市首次实现了3个突破：工业总产值突破100亿元，粮食总产量突破100亿斤，财政收入突破10亿元。人们说，科技在这里起到了关键的作用。
  一个明智的抉择
    1987年12月，这是东北最寒冷的季节。而中共长春市委会议室内却气氛热烈，发言不断，与会者谈论的一个中心议题就是如何把长春的经济搞上去。
    从党的十一届三中全会以来，长春经济建设虽然有了很大进展，但同国内一些发达城市比有着明显的差距。据《中国经济年鉴》统计，1987年长春市在15个中心城市中无论国民生产总值，还是社会生产总值均处于下游水平；工业总产值居东北第六位。
    如何使长春的经济建设有个较大的发展？大家从分析市情出发，议论来，议论去，认识逐渐趋向统一。长春是个穷财政，不可能靠高投入扩大再生产；矿产资源刚刚开发，也不可能靠发展原材料工业增加效益。但长春有得天独厚的科技优势，完全可以靠“科技投入”在有限的耕地上生产更多的粮食和农副产品；在原有的工业基础上去优化产品结构，提高经济效益。
    正是在这次全委会上，一个依靠科技立市、振兴长春经济的思想轮廓开始形成。
    翌年4月，在市第七次党代会上，正式提出了“依靠科技立市，壮大主导产业，强化农业基础，加快对外开放，增强城市功能，城乡一体发展”的长春市经济发展战略思想。
      “科技立市”的抉择，如投石激浪，在全市上下引起震动、反响。
    机关、工厂、科研院所、大专院校……上上下下，方方面面展开了一场“科技立市”的讨论。讨论的中心是怎样为科技立市多做一些贡献。
    各县（市）、区也纷纷提出“科技立县”、“科技兴区”的口号；“科技兴企”、“科技兴农”像一股春风吹进工厂，吹到乡村。
    报纸、电台、电视台等新闻单位拿出重要版面、“黄金时间”开设专栏专题，为科技立市造舆论。
    从此，长春这座年轻的城市开始插上了依靠科技腾飞的翅膀。
    潜在优势正在变为真正优势
      《长春年鉴》载：“1987年全市拥有独立自然科学与社会科学机构99个（其中自然科研机构78个），高等院校26所。有各类科技人员22万多人。”无论科研单位、高等院校的数量，还是各类科技人员人数，均在全国15个大城市中名列前茅。这些雄厚的优势一直处在潜在状态。
    科技立市战略思想的提出，依靠科技进步有关政策的出台，启动了科研单位，大专院校和科技人员面向经济建设的积极性，加速了科技为经济服务，使潜在的科技优势逐渐形成经济上的优势。
    过去是“孔雀东南飞”，如今“孔雀”不飞或回归。某研究所几名科技人员已经打好了去南方某地的申请报告，“科技立市”动员大会召开后，他们为政策所鼓舞，撤回了申请，决心为长春的经济振兴贡献聪明才智。
    过去是偷偷摸摸搞科技服务，不敢“露脸”，如今是大大方方、理直气壮到企业应聘兼职。据不完全统计，一年来有4400多名科技人员以各种不同的方式到中小企业、乡镇企业任职或工作，为企业的科技进步注入了活力。
    一大批科技人员不再吃“皇粮”，不再端“铁饭碗”，不花国家一分钱，本着四自（自筹资金，自愿组合，自主经营，自负盈亏）的原则创办各类民办科研机构。全市的民办科技机构已发展到349家，比1987年增加200多家，成为一支不可忽视的重要科技队伍。
    科研单位与企业的联合越来越紧密，并开始逐步由单一的技术转让，临时性技术合作向长期、稳定的技术联合发展。一年来，全市科研生产联合体已发展到77个，创产值7245.6万元，利税1372.4万元。
        “依靠”意识越发强烈
    依靠科技进步的基点在企业。这是长春市实施科技立市的一个非常明确的思想。
    科技立市战略思想的提出，震动了企业厂长、经理们的心弦。他们开始感到，企业只有紧紧靠上科技，走以“内涵”发展生产的路子，才能在瞬息万变的市场竞争中站稳脚跟，扎住营盘。
    与一汽联营的长春齿轮厂前几年总跟在人家的屁股后面跑，没有自己的定型产品，日子过得紧巴。在实施“科技立市”战略中，这个厂靠科技去增强企业后劲。他们和一汽研究所共同研制的CAS5——20变速箱，集国内外同类产品之长处，具有五速带同步器、操纵轻便灵活和节油等特点，已达到80年代初国际水平。去年这个厂实现利税600多万元，成为长春市的一大富翁。
    一年多来，全市工业企业投产的874项新产品就实现产值6.8亿元、利税1.19亿元。全市有236项新产品达到国内先进水平；14项新产品达到或接近国际先进水平。有3项产品获国家金、银质奖，25项产品获部优质奖，80项获省优质产品奖，283种新产品获省优秀新产品奖。
    依靠科技进步，企业获得了大面积丰收。
  科技兴农方兴未艾
    去年5月，德惠县组织县乡两级领导到某村去检查工作，恰好县里一名农业技术人员也跟去了。到了村里，村民们对干部的到来似乎不大在意，而对这位农业技术员却超乎寻常地热乎，张家拉李家扯，非得让到家吃顿饭不可。干部们检查工作走了，这位农业技术员却想走也走不了，硬是在村里留住了下来。
    是啊，在尝到科技致富甜头的广大农民心中，“官”的概念正在淡化，科技的字眼正在升值。不信，再听听榆树县大坡镇党委书记徐凤山的一席谈：
      “过去做乡村干部的，唱好春抓种、夏抓苗、秋抓收、冬交粮的四季歌就行了。现在这一套吃不开了，干部不懂技术，你就别想指挥农民，说不定还让农民把你考住了”。
    靠科技兴农起步较早的长春郊区，在依靠科技进步上自有他们的一套办法。这个区从去年开始，采用启蒙教育、普及教育、提高教育三种方式，对全区农民分类排队，因人施教，成人培训覆盖面达到70％。科技培训使农民插上了致富的翅膀，全区出现养鸡、蔬菜、葡萄等各种专业户1.7万多户。去年全区实现工农业总产值比1983年增加近2倍。
          共唱科技立市之歌
    科技立市要来“大合唱”，不演“独脚戏”，这是长春市在科技立市中又一个值得称道的特点。
    市税务局自觉转变职能，在科研与生产衔接工作中甘当
  “催化剂”，主动做“红娘”，近两年为1169户企业技术改造、新产品开发、转让成果提供税收的支持。
    市工商行营业部充分发挥金融媒介的作用，利用资金的优势促进科研与生产相结合，去年累计为企业发放技术改造、新产品开发方面的贷款16543万元，使企业新增产值5278万元、利税619万元。
    市政协、市民委注意发挥综合人才库的作用，多次组织科技人员到企业、乡村走访调查，咨询服务。
    目前，全市上上下下、各行各业围着科技立市转、共唱科技立市之歌的局面正在初步形成。
