The new version of the Asian Games fund lottery tickets will soon be issued, with the tickets featuring images of commemorative stamps from previous Asian Games.

	Beijing, December 29 (Xinhua) — The head of the fundraising department for the 11th Asian Games announced today that the issuance of the Asian Games lottery tickets is progressing smoothly. The first batch of 90 million tickets has almost been sold out, with very few remaining. The second batch of new version tickets will begin to be issued in mid-January next year.

	The new version of the Asian Games lottery tickets retains the original features of two draws, a high winning rate, high return rate, and strong appeal. Additionally, there have been some improvements in the design of the ticket images and the setting of prize levels.

	The new version of the lottery ticket features 12 selected commemorative stamps from previous Asian Games. Below the ticket header, the 1990 calendar is still retained, which has both practical value and commemorative significance. It is understood that a total of 105 types of commemorative stamps issued by Asian countries and regions for previous Asian Games have been collected, and the fundraising department will gradually print them on the lottery tickets.

	The first batch of 1 to 5 period Asian Games lottery tickets has already been drawn for the second time in mid-December. The issuing department has decided to draw the special prizes and encouragement prizes for the first batch of 6 to 8 periods (group numbers 060000 to 082799) on February 22 next year.

	Director Wang Zhiliang of the fundraising department also explained the use of the funds. He said that the Asian Games fundraising department has already handed over most of the funds to the organizing committee. These funds have been used to purchase steel, synthetic tracks, and other electronic equipment for the northern swimming venue, Workers' Stadium, and other venues. All funds will be used for the Asian Games, which is undeniable.

	It is understood that the Asian Games organizing committee receives hundreds of letters from all over the country and abroad every day, as well as dozens of remittance slips. This fully expresses the deep concern and support of the Chinese people at home and abroad for the motherland and the Beijing Asian Games.

    亚运会新版基金奖券即将发行
    券面印有历届亚运会纪念邮票图案
    本报北京12月29日讯　记者陈昭报道：第11届亚运会集资部负责人今日在这里宣布，亚运会奖券发行工作进展顺利，首批九千万元奖券已基本卖出，所余无几。第二批新版奖券将于明年1月中旬开始发行。
    新版亚运会奖券保持了原奖券两次开奖、中奖面大、返奖率高、趣味性强等特点，此外，在图案设计与奖金等级设置上又进行了一些新的改进。
    新版奖券券头图案精选了12张历届亚运会的纪念邮票，券头下面仍保留了1990年日历，既有实用价值，又有纪念意义。据了解，现已收集到亚洲各国和地区为历届亚运会发行的纪念邮票共105种，集资部将陆续印在奖券上。
    首批1至5期亚运会奖券已于本月中旬作了第二次开奖，发行部门决定明年2月22日再开首批6至8期（分组编号为060000至082799）的特等奖和鼓励奖。
    集资部部长王志良还就人们比较关心的集资用途作了说明。他说，亚运会集资部已把大部分钱交到了组委会，这些资金已用于为北郊游泳馆、工人体育场以及其他场馆购买钢材、塑胶跑道以及其他电子设备。所有的资金将全部用于亚运会，这点是毫无疑问的。
    据了解，亚运会组委会每天都收到上百封来自全国各地和海外的来信以及几十封汇款单，这充分表达了海内外炎黄子孙对祖国的一片殷殷之情和对北京亚运会的关注及支持。
