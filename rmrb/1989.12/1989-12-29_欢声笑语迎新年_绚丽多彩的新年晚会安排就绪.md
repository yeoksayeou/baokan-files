    Joyous Laughter Welcomes the New Year
    A Vibrant and Colorful New Year's Gala is Ready

    BEIJING -- (Xinhua) -- Capital television workers and artists are working hard in the final stages of preparation. The gala to welcome the first day of the 1990s will air on the 31st and will make the screen vibrant and colorful.

    The Central Television Station's production team, led by chief director Zhang Ziyang, is presenting a gala titled "Stepping into the 1990s." They have summarized the audience's viewing preferences over the past few years and increased the proportion of crosstalk and sketch performances. Jiang Kun, Tang Jiezhong, and Canadian student Lu Shihui, who speaks fluent Mandarin, will perform the crosstalk "Master and Apprentice," which is full of wit. Soon-to-be mother Song Dandan and Huang Hong will collaborate on the sketch "The Birth Control Guerrillas," humorously depicting a couple who dodge and hide to avoid family planning.

    Famous singers Wei Wei, Yan Weiwen, An Dong, Liu Huan, and Duan Pinzhang will showcase their talents on the gala.

    Beijing Television Station is presenting three large-scale galas, which will air on the 30th, 31st, and the 1st of next year. This gala is meticulously arranged by the experienced female director Wu Zhiren and her assistants Yan Xiaoli, Sun Hongxin, and others.

    Beijing Television's gala begins with the Eastern Dance Troupe's dance "Laugh, Laugh, Laugh." Hou Yuewen, Shi Fuquan, Chen Peisi, Zhu Shimao, Yuan Zheng, Cheng Fangyuan, and Li Lingyu will all give outstanding performances. Mao Aimin's "90, It's Magical" offers beautiful blessings to the people.

    欢声笑语迎新年
    绚丽多彩的新年晚会安排就绪
    本报讯　记者李力报道：首都电视工作者和文艺工作者正加紧最后阶段的工作，定于31日晚播出的迎接90年代第一天的晚会将使荧屏绚丽多彩。
    由总导演张子扬率领的中央电视台摄制组推出题为《跨入九十年代》的晚会。他们总结近年来观众的欣赏特点，加大了相声和小品节目的分量。姜昆、唐杰忠与能说流利汉语的加拿大留学生路世伟合说相声《名师高徒》妙趣横生；不久将做母亲的宋丹丹与黄宏合作，演出喜剧小品《超生游击队》，善意地刻划了一对为逃避计划生育而东躲西藏的夫妻。
    韦唯、阎维文、安冬、刘欢、段品章等知名歌手将在晚会上一展歌喉。
    北京电视台推出三台大型晚会，将分别于30日、31日和明年1月1日播出。这台晚会由经验丰富的女导演武志荣和她的助手阎小力、孙洪信等精心编排而成。
    北京台的晚会以东方歌舞团的舞蹈《笑笑笑》开始。侯跃文、石富宽、陈佩斯、朱时茂、远征、成方圆、李玲玉等都有上佳表演。毛阿敏的《九○，就灵》，为人们奉上了美好的祝福。
