In early 1989, a cloud of gloom hung over the decision-makers in Dalian. The city's industrial enterprises were short of working capital by over 10 billion yuan, making it difficult to continue production.

What to do? Asking for help from higher authorities was hopeless, and blaming circumstances wouldn't solve the practical problems.

Dalian people have their own way of thinking. During a government meeting, several decision-makers discussed: We must not overlook this point. Our funding problem is like an energy crisis. On one hand, it is severely lacking, and on the other hand, it is severely wasted, meaning a lot of it is idle. As long as we look inward and deeply tap into our potential, we will surely break through the difficulties.

Quickly, 200 officials from the government and banks formed 20 investigation teams and went to 200 key enterprises to investigate their financial potential. After a month, they uncovered 13.4 billion yuan in idle funds. The initial victory sparked greater ambition. The municipal government established an office for financial clearance and conducted a thorough investigation of the working capital usage of all 3000 enterprises in the city. The results were astonishing: the city had a total of 27.6 billion yuan in financial potential, equivalent to twice the city's funding gap. Of this, 8.4 billion yuan was tied up in inventory and problematic goods, 16.3 billion yuan was delayed or unreasonably occupied, and 1.6 billion yuan was misappropriated or in suspense.

Having discovered the gold vault at their side, how to open it? Dalian people began to look for the key to the vault.

Adjusting inventory, turning dead stock into active capital. In August, the Dalian municipal government carefully organized a trade fair focused on processing surplus inventory and adjusting stock. Enterprises with large inventories were invited to participate. 310 enterprises displayed 18,000 samples. Mayor Wei Fuhai took charge from the first day, acting as the chief coordinator, while banks and commerce departments sent representatives to act as matchmakers. During the fair, many goods previously considered "unmarriageable" found buyers, and the total transaction amount reached 6.7 billion yuan in six days. This fair activated 4.5 billion yuan in idle funds, giving many enterprises struggling with financial difficulties a chance to breathe.

Clearing triangular debts. The triangular debts between industrial and commercial enterprises in Dalian and external entities amounted to 6.5 billion yuan. A debt clearance team jointly formed by the municipal government and banks launched four debt clearance campaigns starting in June. The banks announced: Enterprises that are not proactive in clearing triangular debts will have their loans suspended. They provided 300 million yuan in startup funds and invited over 100 debtors and creditors to participate, using the method of "increasing here and decreasing there, equal transfer" to clear 1.74 billion yuan in triangular debts in a few months.

Practicing "financial management." In recent years, enterprises have engaged in short-term behavior, and banks have relaxed management, leading to many loopholes in the management and use of funds. Someone described it this way: On one hand, they spend money freely, acting like wealthy young masters, and on the other hand, they extend their hands upwards, asking for big money. To address this situation, the Dalian municipal government coordinated with financial, banking, and tax departments to establish four responsibility systems: "working capital use contracting," "special fund tracking and feedback," "tax exemption target management," and "technological transformation project and construction project evaluation." Whoever wants a project, funds, or tax exemption must sign a responsibility statement with the relevant supervisory departments. If funds are found to be misappropriated, wasted, or used inefficiently, the direct responsible person and their supervisor will be punished.

Currently, Dalian has basically overcome the financial strain on the city's economic life. The sign of this is: the funds used by the city's production and circulation industries have changed from tight to relatively relaxed. Since this year, industrial production has steadily increased month by month, and the completion of major economic indicators is better than the provincial and national averages.

    打开身边的“金柜”
    新华社记者　赵昌春　何大新
    今年初，一团乌云笼罩在大连市决策者心头，全市工业企业缺少流动资金十多亿元，生产难以为继。
    怎么办？向上要，没希望，怨天尤人也不解决实际问题。
    大连人有大连人的思维方法。在一次政府办公会上，几位决策人这样议论道：绝不应忽视这一点，我们的资金问题如同能源问题一样，一方面严重不足，一方面又严重浪费，即过多的占压呆滞。只要眼睛向内深入挖潜，我们一定会闯出困境。
    很快，由政府和银行200名干部组成的20个调查组分赴到200家骨干企业调查资金潜力。一个月后，共查出沉淀资金13.4亿元。初战告捷，激起人们更大的“野心”。市政府成立了资金清理办公室，继而对全市3000家企业的流动资金使用情况进行了全面细致的普查。结果令人大吃一惊：全市共有27.6亿元的资金潜力，相当于全市资金缺口的两倍。其中物资和有问题商品占压8.4亿元，拖欠及不合理占用16.3亿元，挤占挪用和悬帐1.6亿元。
    发现了身边的金柜，如何打开它呢？大连人开始寻找金柜的钥匙。
    调剂库存，将死物变活钱。8月间，大连市政府精心组织了一次以处理积压物资、调剂库存为内容的交易会。市内库存较大的企业逐一被“邀请”到会。310个企业共展出18000个样品。市长魏富海从第一天起便坐阵充当总调度，银行、工商等职能部门派人到会当“红娘”。交易会期间，一大批被视为“嫁不出”的“老姑娘”找到了“婆家”，6天时间总成交额达到6.7亿元。这次大会共盘活4.5亿元的呆滞资金，使许多一直被资金难题压得喘不过气来的企业得到喘息之机。
    清理三角债。大连市工商企业与市内外来往的三角债达6.5亿元。由市政府和银行共同组成的清欠小组从6月份起集中开展了4次清欠活动。银行宣称：对清理三角债不积极的企业，停止再贷款。他们拿出3000万元启动资金，先后将100多个债权、债务企业法人请在一起，采取“此增彼减，等额划转”的方法，几个月内共清理三角债1.74亿元。
    修炼“理财术”。近几年来，企业短期行为严重，加上银行放松管理，资金的管理与使用漏洞很多。有人这样形容：一边大把花钱，当“阔少”，一边向上伸手，要大头钱。针对这种情况，大连市政府协调财政、银行、税务等部门，先后建立起“流动资金使用承包”、“专项资金追踪反馈”、“免税目标管理”和“技术改造项目和基建工程评估”等4项责任制。谁要项目、要资金、要减免税，谁就要与有关领导监督部门签责任状，如果发现资金被挪用、浪费或使用效益不高，直接责任者和主管上级将受罚。
    目前，大连市已基本摆脱了资金紧张给全市经济生活带来的困扰。其标志是：全市生产及流通行业所用的资金由紧张变为较为宽松，今年以来工业生产逐月稳步上升，主要经济指标完成情况好于全省和全国平均水平。　（新华社供本报专稿）
