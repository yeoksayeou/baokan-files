	100 Counties in China Achieve Electrification

	XINHUA, Nanning, Dec. 23 -- Reporter Jiang Yaojiang learned from the recent National Rural Small Hydropower Academic Seminar held in Nanning that China has 100 counties that have achieved electrification and passed national acceptance.

	In recent years, China's rural small hydropower development has been rapid. Many places have adopted the method of "three points from the state, collectives, and individuals" to raise funds for power generation, promoting the development of local commodity economies. Statistics show that currently, China's rural small hydropower accounts for 30% of the total power generation of the hydropower system and 36% of the total installed capacity. The power supply area covers 819 counties. Small hydropower has become an important source of electricity for many rural areas.

    全国一百个县实现电气化
    本报南宁12月23日电　记者蒋耀强从日前在南宁举行的全国农村小水电学术研讨会上获悉，我国已有100个县实现电气化，并通过了国家验收。
    近几年来，我国农村小水电发展较快。不少地方采取国家、集体、个人“三个一点”的办法集资办电，促进了地方商品经济的发展。据统计，目前我国农村小水电占水电系统总发电量的30％，总装机容量的36％，供电区达819个县。小水电成了许多农村用电的重要来源。
