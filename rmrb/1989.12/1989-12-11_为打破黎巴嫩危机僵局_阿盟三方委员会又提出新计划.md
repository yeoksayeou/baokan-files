	To break the Lebanese crisis stalemate, the Arab League Tripartite Committee has proposed a new plan.

		BEIRUT, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) — A source close to the Syrian presidential palace revealed to Xinhua today that the Arab Tripartite Committee plans to take new actions to help the Lebanese government expand its authority in various aspects.

		The plan was proposed in a letter from the Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister and the Algerian Foreign Minister, which was handed over to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad today. The letter discussed the latest developments in Lebanon.

		After concluding their visit to Syria, the Saudi Foreign Minister and the Algerian Foreign Minister will visit Iraq, France, and the Vatican to pressure Lebanese Christian leader Michel Aoun, rescue the Taif Agreement, and avoid resolving the Lebanese crisis through war.

		The source said that the Tripartite Committee believes that Iraq, as a supporter of Aoun, plays a prominent role in the Lebanese crisis, and that France and the Vatican have special relations with Aoun.

		The source added that the Committee will seek to involve relevant parties in dialogue according to certain special diplomatic plans, giving Aoun multiple choices. The plan will force Aoun to recognize the legitimacy of President Elias Hrawi and withdraw from the Baabda Presidential Palace.

		According to the plan, if Aoun complies with the Taif Agreement, he can participate in the expanded cabinet or choose a country to serve as Lebanon's ambassador.

		Currently, the purpose of the Tripartite Committee's diplomatic activities also includes ensuring that Syria and Aoun fulfill their obligations for the ceasefire since September and ultimately lead to negotiations between the Lebanese government and Aoun to find a way out of the crisis.

		According to diplomatic sources here, Syria has rejected a new French proposal that calls for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon in exchange for Aoun recognizing Syrian security interests.

		The French proposal calls for the expansion of the Lebanese cabinet to include Aoun and the leader of the largest Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, Elie Hobeika, and the withdrawal of all armed personnel from both sides of the "Green Line" in Beirut.

    为打破黎巴嫩危机僵局
    阿盟三方委员会又提出新计划
    新华社大马士革12月9日电　接近叙利亚总统府的人士今天向新华社记者透露，阿拉伯3方委员会计划采取新的行动，以帮助黎巴嫩政府在各方面扩大其权威。
    该计划是沙特阿拉伯外交大臣和阿尔及利亚外长今天在这里递交给叙利亚总统阿萨德的3方委员会的一封信中提出的。信中谈到了黎巴嫩事态的最新发展。
    沙特外交大臣和阿尔及利亚外长在结束对叙利亚的访问后将访问伊拉克、法国和梵蒂冈，以便对黎巴嫩基督教领导人奥恩施加压力，挽救塔伊夫协议并避免用战争解决黎巴嫩危机。
    这位人士说，3方委员会认为，伊拉克作为奥恩的支持者，在黎巴嫩危机中起着突出的作用，法国和梵蒂冈与奥恩关系特殊。
    这位人士还说，委员会将寻求有关各方按照某些特别外交计划参加对话，以便让奥恩有多种选择。计划将迫使奥恩承认赫拉维总统的合法性和撤出巴布达总统府。
    根据这项计划，奥恩只要遵守塔伊夫协议，他可以参加扩大的内阁，也可以自选一个国家担任黎巴嫩大使。
    目前3方委员会外交活动的目的还包括，保证使叙利亚和奥恩对今年9月以来的停火承担义务，并最终导致黎政府和奥恩为寻求摆脱黎危机举行谈判。
    据此间外交人士说，叙利亚已拒绝了法国提出的关于叙利亚从黎撤军以换取奥恩承认叙利亚安全利益的新建议。
    法国的建议要求扩大黎内阁，让奥恩和黎最大的基督教民兵组织“黎巴嫩力量”司令盖亚盖亚入阁，并要求从贝鲁特“绿线”两边撤走所有的武装人员。
