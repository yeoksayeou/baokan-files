The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the People's Literature Publishing House jointly held a seminar on "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" in Beijing from December 18 to 20. Attendees, including literary theorists, critics, writers, and artists, discussed in depth the basic theoretical ideas, core, and essence of "Deng Xiaoping on Literature," its inheritance and development of Marxist-Leninist literary theory and Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, as well as its guiding role and significance for socialist literature.

The attendees believed that the discussions in "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" about upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, reform and opening up, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics, about the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the tasks of the ideological front, about talents and intellectuals, and about eliminating interference and opposing erroneous tendencies, are a summary and generalization of the historical experience of the past ten years of socialist construction in the new period. These discussions have great guiding significance for our past, present, and future literary work. Especially regarding the theoretical and viewpoints on cultural and artistic issues, they defend, inherit, and develop Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, serving as the guiding principles for the prosperity and development of socialist literature and as a powerful weapon to criticize bourgeois liberalization and various erroneous trends. We must link the actual situation of the literary circle over the past ten years, review and reflect, summarize experiences and lessons, and unite our thoughts with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussions and the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee. This is a very urgent and important task for the literary circle at present.

The attendees pointed out that "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" repeatedly emphasizes that in the new period of socialism, literature and art must prosper and develop by upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, while affirming the achievements on the ideological and cultural front, repeatedly criticized bourgeois liberalization and reaffirmed that pursuing bourgeois liberalization is to take the capitalist road. However, these discussions were either not taken seriously or were distorted and resisted, and have not been well implemented, leading to the rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization, culminating in a turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. The literary circle's study of "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" first requires a serious reflection on the situation of the struggle between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization over the past decade. Currently, the opposition to bourgeois liberalization needs to be further deepened. Many manifestations of liberalization have not been touched, and many thoughts confused by liberalization have not been clarified. This requires the joint efforts of all literary workers to solve these problems, remove obstacles, and further prosper socialist literature.

Many writers and artists present shared their personal experiences, emphasizing that to prosper socialist literature, we must adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's correct views on the relationship between literature and politics, literature and life, and literature and the people. Our literature should portray what kind of image of the Party, the country, the nation, the people, and the youth. This is a major issue concerning the nature and direction of socialist literature. To prosper literature, we must remove the obstacles of bourgeois liberalization, correct the direction, and clarify the guiding ideology. This requires a serious study of Marxist-Leninist literary theory, Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussions on literary issues. Writers and artists with the conditions should go deep into the hot life and the frontline of reform and opening up, grasp the pulse of the times, feel the spirit of the people's active progress and striving for strength, and make greater efforts in depicting and cultivating new socialist people. Literary leaders and management departments at all levels should work hard to promote creation, offer more excellent works to the people. Literary criticism should strengthen the introduction and promotion of these excellent works. Some excellent works that have been buried should be rediscovered. Every effort should be made to meet the spiritual and cultural life needs of the broad masses.

Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, He Jingzhi, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department and Acting Minister of Culture, and Song Mumin, Director of the State Press and Publication Administration, attended the opening ceremony and spoke.

Wang Renzhi said, "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" is a programmatic and guiding document for literary work in the new period of our country. Its content is very rich and profound, not only for literature but also for the entire ideological domain. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theoretical views on literary issues uphold and develop Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, serving as the guiding principles for criticizing bourgeois liberalization and prospering socialist literature. Literary leaders at all levels should first study it thoroughly and organize and lead the broad masses of literary workers to study it thoroughly and comprehensively understand it. He said, during the study, we should seriously reflect and review, summarize experiences and lessons, especially summarize the lessons of the production, development, rampant spread, and serious harm caused by bourgeois liberalization and various erroneous trends in the literary circle. Now, the "anti-pornography" campaign is very popular and necessary, and it should continue in the future. However, "anti-pornography" cannot replace the opposition to bourgeois liberalization. We must clarify what specific manifestations bourgeois liberalization has in literary work, creation, theoretical criticism, and literary history research, and conduct in-depth and scientific criticism. At the same time, we must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's literary theory to guide our literary work, work hard to promote creation, and promote the prosperity of socialist literature. To do these jobs, we must unite the vast majority of comrades in the literary circle, the more united the better. Under the leadership of the new Central Committee of the Party, everyone should unite and invest in the cause of opposing bourgeois liberalization and prospering socialist literature.

He Jingzhi said, at a manuscript meeting held in Zhuozhou in 1987, I once said that comrades in the literary circle should join hands and take up their pens to oppose bourgeois liberalization and prosper socialist literature. Today, we still need to do this. He said, the study of "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" requires a comprehensive understanding and grasp of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of basic theoretical views. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussions on the policies and principles of literature should be understood at the theoretical level. Literary workers must highly value theoretical study. Without a solid theoretical foundation, work has no basis, and without theoretical cultivation, there is no steadfastness, and one will suffer great losses. Study should be combined with practice, and theory should guide practice. Opposing bourgeois liberalization is the most important practical issue at present and in the future. We should use "Deng Xiaoping on Literature" as a guide, deeply criticize the theoretical views of bourgeois liberalization, and correctly and convincingly answer the various erroneous thoughts and ambiguous views in the literary circle. We should closely combine with the actual creation, firmly uphold the "two for" direction and the "hundred flowers and hundred schools" policy, seriously summarize the development laws of socialist literature, and promote the prosperity of socialist literature.

The director of the Literature Bureau of the Propaganda Department, Liang Guangdi, and the president of the People's Literature Publishing House, Chen Zaochun, spoke at the meeting about their experiences in studying "Deng Xiaoping on Literature." Before the seminar ended, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Chinese Writers Association, Malaxiangfu, also spoke.

Attendees also included Li Zhun, Li Shuguang, Xie Mingqing, Li Xifan, Zhalagahu, Ke Yan, Cheng Daixi, Xu Feiguang, Ma Weian, Jiao Zuyao, Li Ruqing, Yang Peijin, Wang Futan, Qi Zhixiang, Zheng Bonong, Ding Zhenhai, Dong Xuewen, Chen Sheng, Han Ruiting, Xie Hong, Zhang Chenghuan, Wu Taichang, Cheng Shuzhen, Xiao Yunru, Aiken, Zhong Chengxiang, Wang Zhong, and more than thirty others. Feng Deying made a written speech.

    学习邓小平文艺理论　繁荣社会主义文艺
    《邓小平论文艺》研讨会在京举行
    与会者指出必须澄清被资产阶级自由化搞乱的思想
    新华社北京12月22日电  中宣部文艺局和人民文学出版社12月18日至20日在京联合召开《邓小平论文艺》理论研讨会。到会的文艺理论评论家、作家、艺术家联系实际，就《邓小平论文艺》的基本思想理论、它的核心和精髓、对马列文论和毛泽东文艺思想的继承和发展，以及对社会主义文艺的指导作用和重要意义等问题，进行了广泛而深入的研讨。
    与会同志认为，《邓小平论文艺》一书中关于坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放、建设有中国特色的社会主义的论述，关于社会主义精神文明建设、思想战线任务的论述，关于人才、知识分子的论述，关于排除干扰、反对错误倾向的论述，是我国社会主义建设新时期十年来历史经验的概括和总结，对我们过去、现在和将来的文艺工作都有巨大的指导意义，尤其是关于文化艺术问题的理论和观点，捍卫、继承和发展了毛泽东文艺思想，是繁荣发展社会主义文艺的指导方针，也是批判资产阶级自由化和形形色色错误思潮的有力武器。我们必须联系文艺界十年来的实际，回顾反思，总结经验教训，把思想统一到邓小平同志的论述上来，统一到党的四中全会、五中全会的精神上来，这是当前文艺界的一件十分紧迫和重要的任务。
    与会同志指出，《邓小平论文艺》中一再强调，在社会主义新时期，文学艺术要繁荣与发展，必须坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。邓小平同志在肯定思想文化战线取得成绩的同时，多次批评了资产阶级自由化，一再重申搞资产阶级自由化就是走资本主义道路。但是，邓小平同志的这些论述或是不被重视，或是遭到歪曲和抵制，一直没有得到很好的贯彻和落实，以致于资产阶级自由化思潮愈演愈烈，泛滥成灾，终于酿成一场动乱和反革命暴乱。文艺界学习《邓小平论文艺》，首先就需要认真反思近十年来四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化对立和斗争的情况。当前，反对资产阶级自由化还有待于深入开展，许多自由化的表现还没有触及，许多被自由化搞乱了的思想还未能澄清，这都需要广大文艺工作者共同努力求得解决，以便扫清障碍，使社会主义文艺进一步繁荣起来。
    到会的不少作家、艺术家从切身体验中感受到，要繁荣社会主义文艺，就必须坚持邓小平同志关于文艺和政治、文艺和生活、文艺和人民等一系列问题的正确论述。我们的文艺，到底应该塑造什么样的党的形象，什么样的国家的形象、民族的形象，什么样的人民的形象、青年的形象，这是关系到社会主义文艺的性质和方向的大问题。要繁荣文艺，就必须扫清资产阶级自由化的障碍，端正方向，明确指导思想。这就要认真学习马列文论和毛泽东文艺思想以及邓小平同志关于文艺问题的论述。有条件的作家、艺术家应该深入到火热的生活中和改革开放的第一线，把握时代跳动的脉搏，感受人民积极进取、奋发图强的精神，在描写和培养社会主义新人方面付出更大的努力。文艺界各级领导和管理部门要下功夫抓好创作，把更多的好作品奉献给人民。文艺评论要加强对这些好作品的介绍和推广。过去被埋没了的一些优秀作品也要重新发掘出来。要千方百计地满足广大群众的精神文化生活的需要。
    中宣部部长王忍之，中宣部副部长、文化部代部长贺敬之，国家新闻出版署署长宋木文出席开幕式并讲了话。
    王忍之说，《邓小平论文艺》是我国新时期文艺工作的纲领性、指导性文件。它的内容十分丰富、深刻，不仅对于文艺，对整个意识形态领域都有重要的指导意义。邓小平同志关于文艺问题的理论观点，坚持和发展了毛泽东文艺思想，是批判资产阶级自由化，繁荣社会主义文艺的指导方针。文艺界各级领导要首先学好并组织和带领广大文艺工作者认真学习，全面领会。他说，学习中要认真反思回顾，总结经验教训，特别要总结文艺界资产阶级自由化和形形色色的错误思潮产生、发展、泛滥及造成严重危害的教训。现在“扫黄”大得人心，很有必要，今后还要继续进行，但是“扫黄”并不能代替反对资产阶级自由化。要弄清楚资产阶级自由化在文艺工作、文艺创作、理论批评以及文学史研究等方面到底有些什么具体表现，并且加以深入地科学地分析批判。同时，要以邓小平同志的文艺理论指导我们的文艺工作，下气力抓好创作，促进社会主义文艺的繁荣。要做好这些工作，就必须团结文艺界的绝大多数同志，团结得越多越好。在新的党中央领导下，大家团结起来，共同投入到反对资产阶级自由化、繁荣社会主义文艺的事业中来。
    贺敬之说，1987年在涿县召开的一次组稿座谈会上，我曾经说过，文艺界的同志们要携起手来，拿起笔来，反对资产阶级自由化，繁荣社会主义文艺。今天我们仍然需要这样做。他说，学习《邓小平论文艺》，要全面理解、领会邓小平同志的一系列基本的理论观点。邓小平同志关于文艺的方针、政策的论述，要提高到理论高度来领会。文艺工作者一定要高度重视理论学习，没有坚实的理论基础，工作就没有根基，没有理论素养就没有坚定性，就要吃大亏。学习要联系实际，理论要指导实践。反对资产阶级自由化就是当前和今后的一个最大的实际。要以《邓小平论文艺》为指导，深入地批判资产阶级自由化的理论观点，针对文艺界的多种错误思想认识和模糊看法，从思想理论上作出正确的有说服力的回答。要密切结合创作实际，理直气壮地坚持“二为”方向和“双百”方针，认真总结社会主义文艺的发展规律，推动社会主义文艺的繁荣。
    中宣部文艺局局长梁光弟和人民文学出版社社长陈早春就学习《邓小平论文艺》的体会在会上作了发言。研讨会结束前，中国作家协会党组副书记玛拉沁夫也讲了话。
    出席研讨会的还有李准、李曙光、谢明清、李希凡、扎拉嘎胡、柯岩、程代熙、徐非光、马畏安、焦祖尧、黎汝清、杨佩瑾、王夫棠、齐致翔、郑伯农、丁振海、董学文、陈燊、韩瑞亭、谢宏、张澄寰、吴泰昌、程树榛、肖云儒、艾克恩、仲呈祥、王仲等三十余人，冯德英作了书面发言。
