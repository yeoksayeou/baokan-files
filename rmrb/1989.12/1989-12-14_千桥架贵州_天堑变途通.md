A state-of-the-art, super-large-span bridge is currently under construction at the Jiangjiehe crossing, where the Red Army once bravely forded the treacherous U River. It will be the most magnificent of the more than 2,900 bridges of various styles in Guizhou.

Prior to this, Guizhou had already built three large-span bridges over the Fuyun River, U River, and Qingshui River, with main spans of 75 meters, 100 meters, and 150 meters, respectively. The bridge currently under construction at the Jiangjiehe crossing has a main span of 330 meters and a height of 270 meters, ranking among the world's top in both span and height.

Currently, Guizhou's bridges, categorized by construction techniques, number 15 types. Each type varies according to the terrain, exhibiting unique characteristics. These bridges either span mountains and valleys or cross rivers and streams, turning the picturesque landscapes of Guizhou into a breathtaking "Thousand Bridges in Bloom" scene. Bridges have become a unique cultural landscape in Guizhou.

Experts have commented that China has many types of bridges, and Guizhou has almost all of them. However, some bridges found in Guizhou may not be found in other parts of the country.

    千桥架贵州  天堑变途通
    据新华社贵阳12月13日电　（记者周晓农、张炳森）一座世界最新式的特大跨度桥梁正在当年红军抢渡乌江天险的江界河渡口兴建，它将是贵州2900多座千姿百态桥梁中最壮观的一座。
    在此之前，贵州已先后在境内的芙蓉江、乌江、清水江上，建起了主跨分别为75米、100米和150米的三座大跨度桥梁。正在江界河渡口兴建的大桥，主跨330米，高270米，跨度和高度名列世界前茅。
    如今，贵州的桥梁按工艺大类分共达15种之多，而包含在每种类型里的桥梁又随地形而变，形态各异自成特色。这些桥梁或跨山渡岭，或锁河平溪，把如画如屏的贵州河山点缀成一幅美不胜收的“千桥竞秀图”。桥，已构成贵州独特的人文景观。
    有专家评价说，中国有的桥，贵州差不多都有，贵州有的桥，国内其他地方却未必有。
