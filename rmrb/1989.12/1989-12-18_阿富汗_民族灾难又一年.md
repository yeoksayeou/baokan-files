After the Soviet troops completely withdrew from Afghanistan on February 15 this year, people had hoped that Afghanistan might restore peace, hundreds of thousands of refugees could return home, and the war-torn Afghan economy could be rebuilt. However, the situation did not develop as people wished. The Afghan people, who had suffered from the war for a decade, spent another year in misery. The civil war rages on, and the people suffer.

At the time of the Soviet withdrawal, the Afghan resistance forces based in Pakistan formed a temporary government, the seven-party alliance. Thus, Afghanistan had two opposing governments: the Kabul government led by Najibullah and the temporary government of the seven-party alliance. Political opposition intensified military conflicts. Soon after the Soviet withdrawal, the seven-party alliance guerrillas chose Afghanistan's third-largest city, Jalalabad, as their target, mobilizing more than 20,000 guerrillas to surround it, and officially launching a full-scale attack on March 6. The guerrillas' goals were to demonstrate their strength to the world, boost morale, and to move the newly established temporary government from abroad to Jalalabad to win hearts and minds domestically and seek international recognition.

The battle for Jalalabad was just the prelude to the Afghan civil war. Subsequently, the guerrillas launched attacks on the second-largest city, Kandahar, and the border city of Khost near Pakistan. They also harassed the strategic supply routes, such as the Salang Pass and the Kabul-Jalalabad Highway, used by the Soviet Union to transport weapons and supplies to the Kabul government. They also attacked the Kabul government's airfields, ammunition depots, and military fortresses. In the latter half of the year, the guerrillas frequently launched rockets and powerful cluster bombs at Kabul and other densely populated areas. The Afghan civil war had fully erupted.

After the Soviet withdrawal, the Kabul government's military faced the situation of having to deal with the guerrilla attacks alone. They adjusted their military deployments, concentrating their main forces in large and medium-sized cities and building extensive fortifications and minefields around them. At the same time, they demanded more advanced weapons and equipment from the Soviet Union. The Kabul government regarded defending Jalalabad as their first test. Without Soviet military support, if they could repel the guerrilla attacks and continue to control this strategic location, it would undoubtedly demonstrate their strength to the world. Therefore, the Kabul government dispatched elite troops to support the defenders of Jalalabad and transported a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

At the beginning of the civil war, the guerrillas made some progress in Jalalabad, temporarily capturing the airport and occupying parts of the old city. However, due to the guerrillas' lack of experience in urban warfare, lack of air support, and the fact that various factions still fought independently, the guerrillas did not achieve significant results in capturing cities over the past year. Large and medium-sized cities remained under government control.

Nearly a year of civil war has resulted in approximately 100,000 Afghan casualties. Factories, farmlands, water facilities, and transportation infrastructure have been further severely damaged. Refugees stranded abroad could not return, and tens of thousands of new refugees fled to neighboring countries.

While military conflicts continued, the international community called for a political solution to the Afghan problem, and diplomatic activities seeking a political resolution became increasingly frequent.

Even before the Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union had held two rounds of direct talks with the Afghan guerrillas. The Soviet Union proposed that the Afghan People's Democratic Party, led by Najibullah, "share power" with other factions in the future government, while the guerrillas insisted that the Kabul government "transfer power" to the guerrillas. Due to the opposing views, no progress was made. In early February, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited Pakistan. The foreign ministers of the two countries issued a joint statement saying, "Military means can only worsen the situation in Afghanistan," and both sides advocated for "a broad-based government formed through the efforts of the Afghan people themselves." However, the Soviet foreign minister also emphasized that "any plan excluding the Afghan People's Democratic Party is unworkable, and the future government must include all factions." In early June, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited the United States and discussed the Afghan issue with President Bush. Both sides agreed that "a representative, non-aligned government should be established in Afghanistan through political means to replace the current illegal regime in Kabul." Bhutto also discussed the "neutral expert cabinet plan" with UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. This plan advocates for an immediate ceasefire, with a "caretaker government" composed of neutral experts, assisted by the UN, to transfer power to a future broad-based new government. The Soviet Union and the Kabul government did not clearly respond to this plan, but the hardline leaders of the seven-party alliance guerrillas rejected it. In late June, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew from Moscow to Islamabad, bringing his "three-step peace plan" for "ceasefire, elections, and government formation." The Soviet Union and the Kabul government expressed agreement with this plan, while the seven-party alliance guerrillas firmly opposed it.

In summary, the political solutions proposed by various parties show that the Soviet Union and the Kabul government insist on "sharing power" in the future government to maintain the position of the People's Democratic Party. The Afghan guerrillas, Pakistan, and the United States advocate for the Kabul government to "transfer power" to the temporary government of the seven-party alliance. The solution to the problem will still take time.

Analyzing the current situation, it is not difficult to see that Afghanistan has not yet achieved peace, which is still the result of direct intervention by two superpowers. After the Soviet withdrawal, in addition to handing over a large amount of weapons and equipment to the Kabul government, they also continuously transported more advanced weapons. The United States, to counter Soviet influence in Afghanistan, strongly supported the Afghan guerrillas in launching armed attacks, aiming to either overthrow the Najibullah regime by force or to achieve a political solution that aligns with American strategic interests. The Afghan civil war is essentially a continuation of the two superpowers' struggle for influence in Central Asia. Additionally, the conflicting parties in the Afghan conflict each emphasize their own interests and cannot prioritize national interests to seek a solution that benefits the country and its people, leading to the continued tragedy.

It is noted that the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are adjusting their Afghan policies according to their own strategic needs. The Soviet Union, on the one hand, proposes various "national reconciliation" suggestions through the Kabul regime to weaken the guerrilla forces, and on the other hand, promotes a political solution through relevant international channels to achieve the "power-sharing" plan. The United States, seeing that the Afghan guerrillas cannot win by force, is also seeking a political solution that benefits itself. Bush's meeting with Bhutto in June can be seen as a turning point in U.S. Afghan policy. Subsequently, the United States also sent high-level officials to contact the former Afghan king Zahir Shah.

Pakistan is also adjusting its Afghan policy. After Bhutto's visit to the United States, the Pakistani government adopted a "dual-track policy" of supporting guerrilla military operations and seeking political solutions; while continuing to insist on the Kabul government "transferring power," it also maintained contact with the Soviet Union, Iran, and forces supporting the former Afghan king Zahir Shah, seeking political solutions.

The international community continues to pay attention to the situation in Afghanistan. At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution on the Afghan issue jointly proposed by the foreign ministers of Pakistan and the Soviet Union was unanimously adopted, calling on the relevant parties to do their utmost to achieve a comprehensive political solution to the Afghan problem and end the military conflict in Afghanistan. However, the current reality shows that solving the decade-long Afghan problem will still take time.

    阿富汗——民族灾难又一年
    本报记者　任毓骏
    今年2月15日苏军完全撤离阿富汗后，人们曾希望，阿富汗可能恢复和平，数百万难民可望重返家园，惨遭破坏的阿富汗经济能得以重建。然而，事态发展不以人们的善良愿望为转移。饱尝战乱之苦的阿富汗民族在苦难中度过了第十个年头。内战不止　百姓遭殃
    在苏联撤军之际，以巴基斯坦为基地的阿富汗抵抗力量七党联盟成立了临时政府。这样，阿富汗就出现了两个敌对的政权机构：以纳吉布拉为首的喀布尔政府和七党联盟临时政府。政治上的对立加剧了军事上的冲突。苏联撤军不久，七党联盟游击队把阿富汗第三大城市贾拉拉巴德选作进攻目标，调集2万多名游击队形成包围之势，并于3月6日正式发起强攻。游击队的目的，一是向世界显示实力，鼓舞士气；二是想把刚成立的临时政府从国外迁入贾城，以便在国内争取人心，在国际上求得承认。
    贾城之战仅是阿富汗内战的序幕。此后，游击队相继对第二大城市坎大哈、靠近巴基斯坦的边境城市霍斯特发起进攻；对苏联向喀布尔政府运输武器物资的交通要道萨朗公路、喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路进行骚扰；对喀布尔政府军的飞机场、弹药库、军营要塞发动袭击。后半年，游击队又频频对喀布尔市和其他人口密集区发射火箭和杀伤力很强的集束导弹。阿富汗内战全面展开。
    苏联撤军后，喀布尔政府军面临单独对付游击队进攻的形势，调整了军事部署，把主要兵力集中在大中城市并在周围大量建筑工事、层层布雷，同时要求苏联支援更多的先进武器和装备。喀布尔政府军把坚守贾拉拉巴德视为对自己的第一个考验。在失去苏军支持的情况下，若能击退游击队的进攻，继续控制这一战略要地，无疑也可对全世界炫耀自己的实力，所以喀布尔政府调集了精锐部队支援贾城守军，同时运去大量武器弹药。
    内战初起，游击队在贾城取得一些进展，一度攻下机场和占据部分老城区。但由于游击队方面缺乏攻坚经验，没有空中力量掩护和支援，再加之各派游击队仍各自为战，所以一年来游击队在攻城方面没有取得显著战果，各大中城市依然控制在政府军手中。
    近一年的内战，造成约十万阿富汗人伤亡，工厂、农田、水利设施以及道路交通遭到更为严重的破坏。滞留国外的难民不但不能回归，又有数以万计的新难民涌入邻国。政治解决　各执己见
    在军事冲突的同时，国际社会呼吁通过政治途径解决阿富汗问题，寻求政治解决的外交活动日趋频繁。
    早在苏军撤离之前，苏联就同阿富汗游击队举行过两轮直接谈判。苏联主张以纳吉布拉为首的阿富汗人民民主党在未来政府中与其他派别“分享权力”，而游击队则坚持让喀布尔政府向游击队“移交权力”。由于双方意见对立，终未取得进展。今年2月初，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽访问巴基斯坦。苏巴两国外长发表联合公报说：“军事手段只能使阿富汗局势更加恶化”，“双方主张通过阿富汗人自己努力组成一个基础广泛的政府”。但苏联外长同时强调，“任何排除阿富汗人民民主党的方案都是行不通的，将来的政府必须包括所有派别。”6月上旬贝·布托总理访问美国，与布什总统重点谈了阿富汗问题，双方都认为，“应通过政治方式在阿富汗建立一个有代表性的不结盟政府”，“以取代目前喀布尔的非法政权”。贝·布托还和联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔讨论了“成立中立专家内阁方案”。这一方案主张首先实现全面停火，在联合国帮助下，由中立专家组成“看守政府”，向未来基础广泛的新政府移交权力。苏联和喀布尔政府未对这一方案明确表态，但七党联盟游击队中的强硬派领导人拒绝这一方案。6月下旬，巴勒斯坦领导人阿拉法特从莫斯科飞抵伊斯兰堡，带来了他的“实现停火、举行大选、组织政府”的“三步和平方案”。苏联和喀布尔政府表示同意这一方案，而七党联盟游击队则坚决反对。
    综观各方的政治解决主张，苏联和喀布尔政府坚持在未来政府中“分享权力”，以保持人民民主党的一席之地。而阿富汗游击队、巴基斯坦和美国则主张喀布尔政府向七党联盟临时政府“移交权力”。解决问题　尚需时日
    分析现状，人们不难看出，阿富汗尚未实现和平依然是两个超级大国直接干涉的结果。苏联撤军后，除移交给喀布尔政府大量武器装备外，又源源不绝地运进许多更为先进的武器。美国为了抗衡苏联在阿富汗的影响，极力支持阿富汗游击队发动武装进攻，即使不能武力推翻纳吉布拉政权，也力求打出一个符合美国战略利益的政治解决局面。阿富汗内战实际上是两个超级大国在中亚地区争夺利益的继续。此外，阿富汗冲突双方各自强调既得利益，不能以民族利益为重，共同寻求有利于国家和人民的解决途径，致使悲剧继续发展。
    人们注意到，美苏两个超级大国出于各自的战略需要，正对各自的阿富汗政策作出某些调整。苏联一方面通过喀布尔政权提出种种“民族和解”建议以瓦解游击队力量，一方面通过国际上有关方面促成政治解决，实现“分享权力”方案。美国看到阿富汗游击队难以用武力取胜，也在谋求有利于自己的政治解决。今年6月布什与贝·布托的会晤，可视为美国阿富汗政策的转折点。此后美国还两次派高级官员和阿富汗前国王查希尔接触。
    巴基斯坦也在调整自己的阿富汗政策。贝·布托访美后，巴政府采取既支持游击队军事行动，也寻求政治解决的“双轨政策”；在继续坚持喀布尔政府“移交权力”的同时，也和苏联、伊朗以及支持阿富汗前国王查希尔的力量保持接触，寻求政治解决途径。
    国际社会依然关注着阿富汗局势。在本届联合国大会上，由巴基斯坦和苏联两国外长共同提出的关于阿富汗问题的决议获得一致通过，呼吁有关各方尽力促成全面政治解决阿富汗问题，以便结束阿富汗的军事冲突。然而，如今的现实表明，要解决十年之久的阿富汗问题，仍需时日。
