The Sixth Company of the Communications Unit of a certain division of the Guangzhou Military Region in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone has maintained iron discipline for ten years. This iron discipline has forged an iron will for the entire unit, enabling them to successfully withstand the test of reform and opening up, earning them the title of "The Good Sixth Company of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone."

According to a report from the Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, the Sixth Company is the only fully established company of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Over the past ten years since the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, this company has consistently excelled in completing the communication support tasks assigned by higher authorities, without any political or administrative incidents of disciplinary violations. The iron discipline of the Sixth Company has demonstrated the noble character of its soldiers, who remain unmoved by money, uncorrupted by wealth, and unshaken by poverty.

The barracks of the Sixth Company are located in a bustling area of Shenzhen City. Within a 500-meter radius, there are 36 hotels, 3 dance halls, and 153 shops. The dazzling array of modern consumer goods presents a tremendous temptation for young soldiers. However, reporters observed that the soldiers strictly adhere to the regulations, requesting leave when going out and reporting back upon return, never using the special nature of the Special Economic Zone as an excuse to violate the rules. Near the company's Wangmu Sentry Post, less than 300 meters away, there is a video screening room that often plays pornographic videos late at night. The two soldiers on duty at the sentry post never visit it. When night falls, the nearby dance halls and karaoke venues are brightly lit with flashing lights and filled with music, despite the fact that many soldiers enjoy singing and dancing, and some were even known as "dance stars" and "singing stars" in their schools before enlisting, none of them have ever entered a dance hall or karaoke venue on their own. Some bosses of joint-venture enterprises near the company have extended invitations to the female switchboard operators of the company more than 10 times to listen to music, dance, and have early tea, all of which were politely declined.

The Sixth Company has always insisted on strictly enforcing discipline without any exceptions or loopholes. Once, the company sent two soldiers out at night to repair a line. The soldiers picked some oranges from a local farmer to quench their thirst. Upon returning, the company's officers discovered the incident and immediately convened a military meeting to severely criticize the two soldiers. The next morning, the officers took the two soldiers back to the orange grove, more than 10 kilometers away, to apologize and compensate the farmer. In June of this year, the company organized a visit to significant places in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone for the old soldiers who were about to be discharged. At Sha Tau Kok, the old soldiers did not enter the "Middle English Street" as per the regulations, but only took a photo outside and left. Some people said that this was too rigid, why not be more flexible? However, the officers and soldiers of the Sixth Company believe that discipline must be strictly followed. If we make exceptions here and there, policies and disciplines will become empty words.

The invisible discipline has formed a strong collective will. Over the past ten years, despite the changing social trends, the Sixth Company's discipline has remained unchanged, effectively resisting various erroneous ideologies. For a period of time, the smuggling of household appliances in Shenzhen became increasingly rampant. In pursuit of quick profits, some units and individuals fell into the abyss of crime, while the officers and soldiers of the Sixth Company remained unmoved, with no one buying smuggled goods. Some soldiers had money sent from home to buy smuggled goods, but they went to the store and bought domestic products to take back. During the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the officers and soldiers of the Sixth Company firmly believed in the Party Central Committee, strictly adhered to political discipline, eliminated interference, and firmly guarded their posts, effectively ensuring the smooth operation of communication lines, and were commended by higher authorities.

    抵御错误思潮冲击　经受改革开放考验
    铁的纪律铸就特区好六连
    新华社深圳11月30日电　（记者吴东峰、通讯员郑穗华）驻深圳特区的广州军区某部通信六连十年如一日遵纪如铁。铁的纪律铸成整体铁的意志，胜利地经受住改革开放的考验，被人称誉为“深圳特区好六连”。
    据广州军区政治部一份调查情况反映，通信六连是我军驻守在深圳特区的唯一建制连队。在深圳特区建立10年间，这个连队年年出色完成上级赋予的通讯保障任务，没有发生一起违犯纪律的政治事故和行政事故。铁的纪律，展现出六连官兵金钱不动、富贵不淫、贫穷不移的高尚风采。
    通信六连营区就在深圳市的繁华地段，仅500米范围内就有36家宾馆，3个歌舞厅，153家商店。五光十色的现代商品世界，对于年青战士来说，无疑具有巨大的诱惑力。但在这里记者却看到指战员们都十分自觉地在规定的范围内活动，外出请假，归队销假，从不强调特区特殊而违反规定。与连队王母哨所相距不到300米处有一个录像放映室，经常在深夜播放黄色录像，在哨所单独执勤的两名战士从不光临。每当夜幕降临，附近歌舞厅、卡拉OK娱乐场彩灯闪耀，歌声不绝，尽管不少战士喜欢唱歌跳舞，有的参军前在学校还享有“舞星”、“歌星”美称，但却没有一个私自进过歌厅舞场。连队附近的一些“三资”企业老板为了感谢连队女话务员的热情服务和帮助，曾先后10多次向她们发出听歌跳舞吃早茶的邀请，均被婉言谢绝。
    通信六连始终坚持执行纪律不打折扣，不搞“上有政策、下有对策”。有一次，连队夜间外出检修线路，两名战士摘了老乡的桔子解渴。返回后连队干部发现了这件事，连夜召开了军人大会对这两位战士进行了严肃的批评。第二天一早又派干部带两名战士返回10多公里远的桔子园，向桔农赔款道歉。今年6月，连队组织即将退伍的老战士到深圳特区有纪念意义的地方参观留影。到了沙头角，老战士们按规定没有进“中英街”，只在外面照了一张相便离开了。有人说，这样做未免太死板了，为什么不能变通一下？而六连的干部战士认为，执行纪律就是要一丝不苟。如果这也变通，那也变通，政策纪律就会变成一句空话。
    无形的纪律约束形成了坚强的整体意志。通信六连在10年的风风雨雨中，无论社会潮流怎么变，他们的纪律观念始终不变，有效地抵御了各种错误思潮的冲击。有一段时间，倒卖家用电器的走私风在深圳越演越烈。为了捞大钱，有些单位和个人走向了犯罪的深渊，而通信六连指战员始终不为所动，没有一人买过走私货。有的战士家里把买走私货的钱都寄来了，他们却到商店买了国产货带回去。在北京发生反革命暴乱期间，六连干部战士坚信党中央，严守政治纪律，排除干扰，坚守岗位，有效地保障了通讯线路畅通无阻，受到上级部门的表扬。
