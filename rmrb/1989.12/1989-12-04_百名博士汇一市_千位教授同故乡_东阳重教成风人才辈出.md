Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 3rd.

In Dongyang City, Zhejiang Province, it is said that "a hundred doctors gather in one city, a thousand professors from the same hometown." Currently, there are 1,149 Dongyang natives who are professors, researchers, or senior engineers working across the country, including four members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In this "City of Professors," the tradition of respecting teachers and valuing education is flourishing, and it continues to contribute more talents to the nation.

Located in central Zhejiang, Dongyang is known as the "Land of Songs and Paintings." As early as the Tang and Song dynasties, it was filled with academies and schools. During the Southern Song Dynasty, prominent scholars like Zhu Xi and Ye Shi gave lectures here, fostering a thriving academic atmosphere that produced generations of talents. Since the founding of New China, especially in the past ten years, the people of Dongyang have carried on this tradition, and the respect for teachers and education has become even more prevalent.

In 1987, Dongyang's total industrial and agricultural output value exceeded 1 billion yuan. With the development of the economy, Dongyang has been raising funds for education every year. In 1987 alone, the city invested over 2 million yuan in education. Since the restoration of the national college entrance examination system, Dongyang has sent more than 12,000 new students to colleges and universities nationwide, which is 3.7 times the number sent in the 17 years before the founding of the People's Republic. In the past ten years, an average of more than 700 new students have been sent to higher education institutions each year, ranking first in Zhejiang Province.

    百名博士汇一市  千位教授同故乡
    东阳重教成风人才辈出
    新华社杭州12月3日电  （通讯员卢贤松）浙江省东阳市人称“百名博士汇一市，千位教授同故乡”，现有1149名东阳籍的教授、研究员、高级工程师在全国各地工作，其中包括4位中国科学院学部委员。现在这个“中国教授市”的尊师重教风气日盛，正为国家输送更多的人才。
    地处浙江中部的东阳，素有“歌山画水之乡”的美称。早在唐宋时期，这里就遍建书院、学馆，南宋理学大师朱熹、叶适都曾在这里设坛讲学，学风昌盛造就了一代代人才。新中国成立后，特别是近十年来，东阳人弘扬这一传统，尊师重教之风在这里更盛。
    东阳市在1987年工农业总产值突破10亿元。随着经济的发展，东阳年年集资办学，仅1987年全市集资办学投资就达200多万元。全国恢复高考制度以来，东阳已向全国大中专学校输送新生1.2万多名，是建国前17年的3.7倍。近十年来，这里平均每年都向高等院校输送新生700多名，居浙江省首位。
