Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 19th.

Qian Qichen, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, met with Michael Costello, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, this morning.

When discussing Australian Foreign Minister Evans' new proposals for resolving the Cambodian issue, Qian Qichen said, "China appreciates the efforts made by the Australian government over the years to achieve a political solution to the Cambodian problem. We support Australia's proposal to strengthen the role of the United Nations in politically resolving the Cambodian issue. To realize the Australian side's new proposals, there are still many difficulties. Any suggestions regarding the Cambodian issue can only be feasible if there is consensus among the four parties in Cambodia."

When discussing Sino-Australian bilateral relations, Qian Qichen said, "Although China and Australia have some differences, it is precisely because of these differences that we need to strengthen contact to enhance mutual understanding. China will continue to develop economic and trade relations with Australia on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which is beneficial to both sides. Damage to such relations is not beneficial to either side."

    钱其琛会见科斯特洛
    新华社北京12月19日电　外交部长钱其琛今天上午会见了澳大利亚外交贸易部副秘书长迈克尔·科斯特洛。
    在谈到澳大利亚外长埃文斯关于解决柬埔寨问题的新设想时，钱其琛说，中国赞赏澳大利亚政府多年来为政治解决柬埔寨问题所作出的努力，赞成澳大利亚在政治解决柬埔寨问题中加强联合国的作用的主张。要实现澳方的新设想，还有很多困难。任何有关柬埔寨问题的建议，只有在柬埔寨四方达成一致的基础上，才是可行的。
    在谈到中澳双边关系时，钱其琛说，中澳两国尽管存在一些分歧，但正因为有分歧，需要加强接触，以增进相互了解。中国将继续在平等互利的基础上发展同澳大利亚的经贸关系，这对双方都是有利的，而这种关系受到损害对双方都不利。
