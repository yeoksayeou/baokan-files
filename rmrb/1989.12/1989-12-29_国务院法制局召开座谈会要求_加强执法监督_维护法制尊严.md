The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office organized a symposium on administrative law enforcement supervision and inspection work in some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, which concluded today in Beijing. The meeting emphasized that strengthening law enforcement and upholding the dignity of socialist legal system is not only an objective requirement for consolidating the people's trust in the legal system and consolidating and developing socialist legal system, but also a need to realize the people's will, implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and establish and maintain the Party and government's prestige among the people.

Delegates at the meeting believe that over the past decade, China's legal system construction has made significant progress, especially in legislation. The situation of having no laws to rely on during the "Cultural Revolution" has been basically reversed. The current laws, administrative regulations, local regulations, and administrative rules have basically covered the main aspects of social relations, and a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics has been initially formed.

The meeting noted that although the legislative task is still arduous, from an overall perspective, the main task of China's socialist legal system construction has shifted from focusing on legislation a decade ago to giving equal importance to both legislation and law enforcement.

The meeting stressed that administrative law enforcement supervision and inspection is an important part of China's socialist legal system construction. Therefore, strengthening law enforcement supervision and inspection and improving the law enforcement supervision mechanism should be an urgent task in strengthening socialist legal system construction and should be included in the important agenda of governments at all levels.

Sun Wenchong, Director of the State Council's Legislative Affairs Office, spoke at the closing meeting today. Deputy Director Huang Shuhai summarized the meeting.

    国务院法制局召开座谈会要求
    加强执法监督  维护法制尊严
    本报北京12月28日讯　新华社记者周立宪、本报记者苏宁报道：国务院法制局组织召开的部分省、自治区、直辖市行政执法监督检查工作座谈会今天在北京结束。会议强调指出，加强执法，维护社会主义法制的尊严，不仅是巩固人民群众对法制的信任感，巩固和发展社会主义法制的客观要求，而且是实现人民意志，贯彻党的路线、方针和政策，确立和维护党和政府在人民群众中威信的需要。
    与会同志认为，10年来，我国的法制建设有了很大发展，尤其是在立法方面，“文革”期间造成的无法可依的局面已基本扭转。我国现有的法律、行政法规、地方性法规和行政规章，已基本覆盖了社会关系的各个主要方面，有中国特色的社会主义法律体系已初步形成。
  会议认为，尽管立法工作的任务仍很繁重，但是，从总体上看，我国社会主义法制建设的主要任务，已由10年前的以立法工作为主，转变为立法与执法并重。
    会议强调，行政执法监督检查，是我国社会主义法制建设的一项重要内容。因此，加强执法监督检查，健全执法监督机制，应当作为加强社会主义法制建设的一项迫切任务，列入各级人民政府的重要议事日程。
    国务院法制局局长孙琬钟在今天的闭幕会上讲了话，副局长黄曙海作了会议总结。
