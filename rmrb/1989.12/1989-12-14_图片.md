The key soybean-producing region in Northeast China, the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area's Jiusan Agricultural Management Bureau, saw a bumper harvest of soybeans this year. After the successful harvest, the farm workers, mindful of the nation's needs, delivered high-quality soybeans to the state. The foreign trade department actively organized the export of soybeans, with the capacity to ship 10 train cars per day. By mid-November, 12,000 tons of soybeans had been exported, accounting for one-third of the bureau's export quota, surpassing previous years' performance.
