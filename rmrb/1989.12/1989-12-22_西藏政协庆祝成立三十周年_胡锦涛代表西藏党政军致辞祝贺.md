The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) of the Tibet Autonomous Region held a grand tea party on the afternoon of December 20 to celebrate its 30th anniversary in the traditional festive manner of the Tibetan people.

Pabala Gyaltsen Trinley, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC and Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region CPPCC, spoke about the historical background of the Tibet CPPCC's establishment. On May 23, 1951, Tibet achieved peaceful liberation, and the Tibetan people forever shook off the shackles of imperialist aggression. The Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, after eight years of arduous struggle, won over an increasing number of Tibetan patriots. Under the Party's policy of national unity and education, they recognized that the Communist Party of China was the savior of the Tibetan people and that only by following the socialist path could Tibet have a bright future. Patriotic upper-class figures flocked to the Party, forming an anti-imperialist, patriotic, and united front, which rapidly grew stronger. On December 20, 1959, the first session of the first CPPCC of Tibet was successfully convened.

He said that the armed rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet in 1959 and the disturbances in Lhasa since 1987 were all attempts by a few separatist elements, under the manipulation and direction of international anti-China forces, to separate Tibet from the motherland. In this severe struggle, Tibetan patriots have always stood firmly on the side of the Party and the people, engaging in a resolute struggle against separatism.

Hu Jintao, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, spoke on behalf of the Party, government, and military leadership of Tibet. He said that 30 years ago, the Tibet CPPCC was born at a moment of great victory in suppressing the rebellion and implementing democratic reforms, marking the beginning of a new period of consolidation and development for the Tibetan people's democratic united front. He said that over the past 30 years, the Tibet CPPCC has played an important role in uniting people from all walks of life to perform political consultation, democratic supervision, and participate in the formulation of major policies. The achievements in various construction projects and reform and opening-up in Tibet all contain the sweat and toil of the broad masses of CPPCC members and patriots.

    西藏政协庆祝成立三十周年
    胡锦涛代表西藏党政军致辞祝贺
    本报拉萨12月20日电　记者卢小飞报道：中国人民政治协商会议西藏自治区委员会于20日下午举行盛大茶话会，以藏民族传统的喜庆方式，庆祝它30岁生日。
    全国政协副主席、西藏自治区政协副主席帕巴拉·格列朗杰在发言中，介绍了西藏政协诞生的历史背景。1951年5月23日，西藏实现了和平解放，西藏人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的侵略和羁绊。中国共产党和人民解放军经过8年艰苦卓绝的努力，使越来越多的西藏爱国人士，在党的民族政策的感召和教育下，认识到中国共产党是西藏人民的救星，只有走社会主义的道路，西藏才有光明的前途，爱国上层人士纷纷向党靠拢，形成了反帝爱国统一战线，并迅速壮大。1959年12月20日，西藏政协第一届委员会第一次会议胜利召开。
    他说，1959年西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱和1987年以来拉萨发生的骚乱，都是少数分裂主义分子在国际反华势力操纵指使下，妄图把西藏从祖国分裂出去。西藏爱国人士在这场严峻的斗争中，始终坚定地站在党和人民的立场上，同分裂主义进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛代表西藏党政军领导机关致辞说，30年前，西藏政协是在平息叛乱和民主改革取得伟大胜利的时刻诞生的，它标志西藏人民民主统一战线进入了巩固发展的新时期。他说，30年来，西藏政协在团结各界爱国人士履行政治协商、民主监督的职能，以及参与重大方针政策的制定等方面发挥了重要作用。西藏各项建设事业和改革开放所取得的成就，都包含着广大政协委员和爱国人士的心血和汗水。
