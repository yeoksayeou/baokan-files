Various sectors in Yugoslavia have taken action to participate in the rescue efforts at the Alexinac coal mine fire, and have donated five trillion dinars (approximately five million US dollars) to assist the families of the deceased miners.

On November 17, a fire broke out at the Alexinac coal mine in southern Serbia, trapping more than a hundred miners in a shaft 700 meters underground. Among them, 90 people lost their lives. After the news spread, the entire country mobilized. Twenty-four coal mines across the country dispatched more than 2,000 rescue personnel, who worked tirelessly for 29 days. By December 16, all the remains of the deceased had been brought to the surface.
