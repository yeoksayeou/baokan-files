Bai Chunli is a fortunate individual. In 1975, he entered Peking University. In the first year after the resumption of graduate admissions, he became a graduate student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Chemistry, smoothly obtaining his master's and doctoral degrees. In September 1985, amidst the wave of studying abroad, he effortlessly crossed the ocean to enter the University of California as a postdoctoral researcher, focusing on the study of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).

By 1987, Bai Chunli had spent two years studying in the United States. His efforts paid off when, at the Second International STM Conference held that year, his paper was selected as one of the main conference reports. The computer software he developed was adopted by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Dr. Richard E. Smalley, a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, highly praised Bai Chunli's work, calling him one of the most talented young scientists.

In October 1987, Bai Chunli completed his postdoctoral research in the United States. At this time, the president of an American company tried to persuade him to stay. He faced two choices: a generous salary or the construction of his motherland. Bai Chunli did not waver in his resolve to serve his country. He used his savings of $5,000 to purchase necessary instruments and equipment, bringing back valuable technical data and some STM key components he had designed and manufactured, which were not yet produced domestically.

Bai Chunli's friends, classmates, and acquaintances were concerned about his situation after his return. After his return, Academician Zhou Guangzhao learned about Bai Chunli's situation at a discussion meeting and subsequently, the Planning Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences carefully reviewed Bai Chunli's work. Zhou Guangzhao allocated 300,000 yuan from the academician's fund to support Bai Chunli's high-level research, just over a month after his return. From this point on, the academician's fund became a dedicated fund to support young people with the potential to achieve international first-class work.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Chemistry also attached great importance to Bai Chunli's work, establishing a laboratory for him and providing some equipment. In April 1988, Academician Zhou Guangzhao visited the Institute of Chemistry and inspected Bai Chunli's laboratory. A few days later, Bai Chunli led the development of China's first computer-controlled STM with data analysis and image processing capabilities. This instrument, with its unique design and effective solutions to key technical problems, reached the highest level of laboratory-developed instruments in the world. Subsequently, he began new explorations in the atomic world. He and his colleagues used this STM to study graphite, molybdenum disulfide, organic conductors, biomembranes, conductive polymers, mercury dichloride, and soluble high polymer materials, all yielding satisfactory results.

In March 1989, Bai Chunli led the development of China's first Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), with a resolution reaching the atomic level. Currently, only a few laboratories worldwide have developed AFMs that can achieve this level.

This summer, Bai Chunli attended the Fourth International STM Conference held in Japan, where all four of his submitted papers were accepted by the conference.

Bai Chunli's work has received high praise from society. He has been received by Deng Xiaoping and other party and state leaders four times; during the 1989 Spring Festival Gala, he was introduced to the nation as a young scientist; in October 1989, he was awarded the Chinese Academy of Sciences Young Scientist Award and was named a National Advanced Worker.

Recently, Bai Chunli received notice that his laboratory has become a key project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with a two-year grant of 960,000 yuan. It is believed that his research will reach new heights.

    学得本领  报效祖国
    ——记中国科学院化学所青年科学家白春礼
    黄勇
    白春礼是生活中的幸运儿，1975年进了北京大学，在恢复研究生招生考试后的第一年，他又成为中国科学院化学所的研究生，一路顺风地拿到硕士、博士学位。1985年9月，在出国热中，他轻轻松松地漂洋过海，进入美国加州大学作博士后研究生，从事扫描隧道显微镜（STM）的研究工作。
    1987年，白春礼已在美国学习了两年。功夫不负有心人，在1987年召开的第二届STM国际会议上，他的论文被列为大会报告之一，他所编制的有关计算机软件被美国海军实验室采用。美国科学院院士白尔德斯楚维勤博士高度评价了白春礼的工作，并称他是最有才华的青年科学家之一。
    1987年10月，白春礼结束了在美国的博士后研究。这时，一家美国公司总裁竭力挽留他。摆在他面前有两条路，一条是优厚的待遇，一条是祖国的建设，白春礼没有动摇他报效祖国的信念，他拿出自己节省的5000元美金，购置了必要的仪器设备，带着宝贵的技术资料，带着用自己加工、设计的一些国内尚未生产的STM技术关键部件，回到了祖国。
    白春礼的亲友、同学及好友们关注着他回国后的境况。在他回国后，周光召院长在一次讨论会上得知了白春礼的情况，随后中科院计划局派人对白春礼的工作进行了仔细的论证，周光召从院长基金中拨出30万元，支持白春礼从事高水平的研究，这时他才回国一个多月。也就是从这一次开始，院长基金成为重点支持那些有希望做出国际一流水平工作的青年人的专用资金。
    中科院化学所也十分重视白春礼的工作，为他组建了实验室，配备了一定的设备。1988年4月，周光召院长来到化学所，参观了白春礼的实验室。在这之后的几天，白春礼主持研制出我国第一台带计算机控制、有数据分析和图像处理的STM。这台仪器以其独特的设计思想及对关键技术问题的合理解决，达到了国际上实验室研制仪器的最高水平。随后，他在原子世界里开始了新的探索，他和同事们利用这台STM研究石墨、二硫化钼、有机导体、生物膜、导电高分子、二氯化汞、可溶性高分子材料等，都得到了可喜的结果。
    1989年3月，白春礼又主持研制出我国第一台原子力显微镜（AFM），分辨能力达到原子级，目前世界上还只有少数实验室研制的AFM能够达到这一等级。
    今年夏天，白春礼出席了在日本召开的第四届国际STM会议，他提交的4篇论文全部被大会录取。
    白春礼的工作得到了社会的高度评价。他曾4次受到邓小平等党和国家领导人的接见；1989年春节联欢晚会上，他作为青年科学家被介绍给全国人民；1989年10月，他被授予中国科学院青年科学家奖，并被评为全国先进工作者。
    最近，白春礼得到通知，他主持的实验室成了中国科学院的重点项目，两年拨款96万元。相信他的研究将会跃上一个新的高度。
