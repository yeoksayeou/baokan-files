Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 4th.

Song Jian, a member of the State Council and the Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, emphasized today at the national meeting on planned electricity usage and the promotion of electric load control technology in Zhengzhou that, "In terms of energy development and utilization, we must adhere to the principle of balancing development with conservation. This is a long-term policy that must be implemented to alleviate the current tight energy supply situation. Therefore, we must follow the instructions of Comrade Li Peng and make the promotion and application of electric load control a priority task during the period of rectification and adjustment, and organize its implementation in a planned and step-by-step manner."

In recent years, China's power industry has maintained a high growth rate. The installed capacity of power generation equipment has been increasing at an annual rate of nearly 10%, with an additional 10 million kilowatts of power generation capacity added in the past three years. This rate of increase is rare in the world. However, Song Jian pointed out that due to the overheating of the economy in previous years, the imbalance between basic industries and processing industries has become increasingly apparent, leading to a situation where energy supply cannot meet demand, and electricity supply is continuously and severely strained. From a long-term development perspective, China is also an energy-deficient country. Therefore, in terms of energy development and utilization, we must adhere to the principle of balancing development with conservation. Currently, we must vigorously promote the application of electric load control as an effective measure for planned and conservative electricity usage, and treat it as a priority task during the period of rectification and adjustment, organizing its implementation in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    宋健要求各地重视节约用电计划用电
    尽快推广电力负荷控制技术
    本报郑州12月4日电　记者李杰报道：“在能源开发和利用方面，必须实行开发与节约并重的方针，这是缓和当前能源供应紧张状况的一项必须长期执行的方针。为此，要按李鹏同志的要求，把推广应用电力负荷控制作为治理整顿期间的一项紧迫任务，有计划有步骤地组织落实。”这是国务委员、国家科委主任宋健今天在郑州召开的全国计划用电暨电力负荷控制技术推广应用工作会议上强调的。
    我国电力工业近几年来连续保持高速增长。发电设备装机容量以每年近10％的速度增长，近3年来每拟增加发电装机1000万千瓦左右。这在世界上也是少有的高速度。但是，宋健指出，由于前几年经济发展过热，基础工业和基础设施与加工工业比例失调的问题越来越明显，出现了能源供不应求，电力供应持续地全面紧张的形势。从长远发展看，我国也是一个能源紧缺的国家。所以，在能源开发和利用方面，必须实行开发与节约并重的方针。当前，要大力推广应用电力负荷控制这一有效的计划用电、节约用电措施，把它作为治理整顿期间的一项紧迫任务，有计划、有步骤地组织落实。
