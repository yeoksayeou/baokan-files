The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, a project that has drawn national attention, is China's first large-scale nuclear power plant designed, funded, and constructed entirely by the country itself. Recently, exciting news came from the Hangzhou Bay construction site: the critical infrastructure project—the massive intake and outlet water channels—has been successfully completed!

The task of completing this project was entrusted to the naval engineering team—the East China Sea Fleet Engineering Ship Squadron. This battle-hardened unit, from its leaders, engineers, rock blasters, and divers to the sailors of various types of ships, has endured countless hardships and fought for three years in the treacherous and rarely traversed waters of Hangzhou Bay. They have successfully completed the task with high quality and on schedule.

In recent years, the Engineering Ship Squadron has made significant contributions to the construction of the Golden Coast. They have participated in major projects such as the North Lv Port 100,000-ton wharf, the famous "High House" observation station on Yongshu Reef in the Nansha Islands, the Sichuan Longzhou Power Station, and other key national projects, completing dozens of urgent, important, dangerous, and difficult tasks. Entrusting the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant intake and outlet water channel project to such a reliable and capable unit was the best choice.

On June 10, 1986, the Engineering Ship Squadron set out for the Hangzhou Bay construction site. Starting a new venture always comes with hardships. The place they were to set up camp was a virgin sea area with no people, no sails, no roads, and no docks. Due to weather constraints, they could only sail in during the hottest season, climb ashore on steep cliffs without docks, and tread a path through the grass. Hundreds of tons of steel pipes and other equipment were carried by sailors on their shoulders and hands, climbing mountains and crossing valleys to reach the camp.

Drilling blast holes was a marathon of hard work that lasted a year and a half. The blast holes they drilled were not the usual round pits but were pipe-shaped, reaching as high as fifteen or sixteen stories, and generally as high as four or five stories. Yang Junming's team of five sailors worked the hardest, were the most tenacious, and could overcome the most difficulties, earning them the nickname "Five Little Tigers" on the construction site. They worked on the Qinshan site for over 400 days, drilling 264 blast holes. Each blast hole was an average of 40 meters deep. If you ask how much bonus they received? They only got four jiao per day for meal allowance, not enough to buy half a pack of "Marlboro" cigarettes.

With all the blast holes for the nuclear power plant intake and outlet water channels drilled, they awaited the command to load the explosives and detonate. The person in charge of this massive explosion involving more than ten tons of explosives was the squadron's engineering expert, underwater demolition specialist, and naval eighth-level technical colonel Yang Yucheng. He was fully aware of the heavy responsibility he bore. To ensure the success of the explosion in one go and to ensure that the nuclear reactor and other equipment were not affected, Yang Yucheng sought advice from experts, conducted repeated scientific tests, and invited more than 30 leaders and experts from relevant departments to conduct scientific deliberations. Yang Yucheng personally answered questions until the experts were satisfied.

The moment of thunderous explosion finally arrived. With a deafening roar, a smoke column rose 200 meters high. Success! The explosion took only 0.7 seconds, achieving all the engineering objectives. At the same time, the monitoring station reported that the main body of the nuclear reactor and other equipment of the nuclear power plant were intact.

Just as one arduous task was completed, another challenging task followed. The large-scale explosion blasted 12,000 cubic meters of granite debris into the sea, which needed to be immediately cleared away. Due to the size of some of the boulders, divers had to enter the sea to drill holes and set off explosions. It was mid-winter, with heavy snowfall and freezing water. Led by Gu Weiguo, eight divers took turns entering the sea to clear the debris. Together with the dredging ship sailors, they fought for five months, finally clearing away more than 10,000 cubic meters of boulders, securing construction time for other projects at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant.

    海魂系秦山
    港洲　张鸣　远方
    举国瞩目的秦山核电站，是我国历史上第一座自己设计、自己投资、自己建造的大型核动力发电站。最近，从杭州湾工地传出令人振奋的喜讯：秦山核电站的咽喉工程——规模巨大的进出水口全套工程，已经顺利竣工了！
    承担这项工程任务的是海军的工程劲旅——东海舰队工程船大队。这支久经战阵的部队，从领导、工程师、炸礁手、潜水兵到各类船艇的水兵，在浊浪滔天、人迹罕见的杭州湾，吃尽千般苦，奋战三年整，终于保质保量地完成了任务。
    近年来，工程船大队在黄金海岸建设中屡建功勋。他们还先后参加了北仑港万吨级码头的大会战、南沙群岛著名的永暑礁观测站“高脚屋”的建造、四川垄嘴电站等国家重点工程建设，完成了几十项急、重、险、难的任务。把秦山核电站进出水口工程交给这样一支信得过、过得硬的部队，是再合适不过的了。
    1986年6月10日，工程船大队开赴杭州湾工地。创业，总是与艰苦相伴。他们要去安营扎寨之地，是块没有人烟，没有帆影，没有道路，没有码头的处女海区。由于受气候的限制，他们只能在最炎热的季节开船进入，在没有码头的峭壁上攀登上岸，在没有路的草丛中踩出一条路前进。几百吨重的钢管和其他装备物资，全靠水兵在烈日曝晒下肩背手提，翻山越岭到达营地。
    打炮眼。这是历时一年半的马拉松式的艰苦奋战。他们打的炮眼不是通常那样的一个圆坑，而是管道式的、长达十五六层楼高，一般也长达四五层楼高。杨俊明班的五名水兵干得最欢，最有韧性，也最能克服困难，被人称为工地上“五只小老虎”。他们在秦山工地整整干了400多天，凿了264个炮眼。每个炮眼平均40米深。要问他们领到了多少奖金？每天只有四角钱的伙食补助，还不够买半根“万宝路”香烟。
    核电站进出水口爆破炮眼全部钻凿完毕，单等指挥部一声令下，装药爆炸。负责这次十多吨炸药大爆炸的是大队工程师、水下爆破专家、海军八级技术上校杨玉成。他深知肩负责任的重大。为了保证爆炸一次成功，保证核反应堆和其他设备不受影响，杨玉成到处请教专家，反复进行科学测试，并请来有关方面的领导、专家30多人进行科学论证，由杨玉成当场进行答辩，直至专家们放心为止。
    雷霆万钧的时刻终于到来了。随着轰隆隆巨响，烟柱腾起200米高。成功了！爆破只用0.7秒钟，全部达到工程预定目的。同时，经监测站报告，核电站主体核反应堆及其他设备完好无损。
    一个艰巨的任务刚完成，另一个艰巨的任务又接踵而来。大爆破炸掉花岗岩1.2万立方的石渣石块大部落在海里，需要立即清除干净。由于有的石块过大，需由潜水兵潜入海底，用风钻凿眼引爆。时值隆冬，大雪纷飞，水寒刺骨。由谷卫国带头，八个潜水兵轮番闯入海底清渣。他们与挖泥船水兵们一起拚搏5个月，终于把万余立方的石块彻底清除干净，为秦山核电站其他工程争得了施工时间。
