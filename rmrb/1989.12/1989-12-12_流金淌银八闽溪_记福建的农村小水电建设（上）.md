Fujian is a province rich in mountains and water. Every clear stream, after nourishing the land along its path and the coastal areas, eventually flows into the sea. Its potential has long been unrecognized. Now, through the pursuit of rural electrification, the once-ignored water has been transformed into a resource as valuable as gold and silver.

Lack of Oil and Coal Does Not Mean Lack of Energy

Fujian is naturally deficient in coal and oil. The primary source of energy for economic development lies on the surface. Among the surface resources, the most widely utilizable is water, which flows year-round through countless mountains and valleys.

The archives of the Fujian Provincial Water Resources Department contain a series of enticing figures: There are 597 rivers and streams in the province with a drainage area of over 50 square kilometers; the annual average precipitation is over 1600 millimeters; the theoretical hydropower resources identified through surveys amount to 10.46 million kilowatts, with 8.07 million kilowatts available for development and utilization, ranking first in East China; among these, small hydropower resources account for 41%, totaling 3.31 million kilowatts, nearly equivalent to one and a half times the installed capacity of the Gezhouba Hydropower Station...

Over the past 40 years since liberation, and especially in the 10 years since the reform and opening up, Fujian's hydropower, particularly small hydropower, has made significant strides. Currently, 100% of the townships, 95% of the natural villages, and nearly 90% of the households in the province have access to electricity. In 47 counties and cities (more than two-thirds of the total), the primary source of electricity is small hydropower. More than 8,000 small hydropower stations are like sparkling jewels embedded in the mountains and rivers of Fujian, with an average of 120 stations per county; the total installed capacity reaches over 1.1 million kilowatts, accounting for 61% of the province's hydropower installed capacity; the annual power generation accounts for one-third of the province's total power generation, forming a three-legged structure with large hydropower and thermal power.

“To Change, First Electrify”

The phrase “To change, first electrify” is widely circulated in Fujian. What left a deep impression on us is that, unlike many other places, the leaders here are not in a rush to “demand electricity” but are eager to “provide electricity.”

Of course, this correct mindset is also a result of being “forced” to think this way.

Dehua County, famous for its porcelain with a history of several hundred years, has traditionally used pine wood for firing kilns. In recent years, some have switched to coal and oil, but the consumption of firewood remains significant. The mountains are becoming increasingly barren, and the ecological environment is deteriorating, not to mention the loss of the economic advantage of porcelain.

In fact, it is not just the local economy; the lives of people in the mountainous areas are also facing the same predicament. In Shilu Village, Yuxi County, the village secretary Chen Shibin has this account: On average, each household consumes about 7,000 to 8,000 kilograms of firewood per year. With 75 households in the village, that amounts to over 500,000 kilograms. The trees grow much slower than they are burned. Watching the surrounding mountains become bald day by day is a stark reality.

It is this simple drive for survival and development that has spurred the rise of small hydropower construction.

Thus, logical decisions were made. As early as 10 years ago, the leaders of Yong'an City (then a county) established the “Five-Head” economic development strategy: “Water power leads, develop stone, utilize wood, develop mountains, and promote fields.” Although the former county party secretary Yuan Qitian left Yong'an six or seven years ago, to this day, many people still vividly recall how he led the county's leaders to build a weir and dam to construct the Yumutan Power Station. “Water power leads,” with the leaders taking the initiative, Yong'an underwent a significant transformation in just a few years. The installed capacity and annual power generation of small hydropower, which ranked 40th among the more than 60 counties in Fujian 10 years ago, now leads the nation with four consecutive years at the top. Driven by electricity, the advantages of “stone” and other resources have been fully utilized, and industries such as cement, coal, and smelting have rapidly developed. The output value of township enterprises increased sevenfold in six years; the city's fiscal revenue also increased, ranking first among all counties in the province and surpassing many prefecture-level cities.

Dehua porcelain has also developed in a new cycle. Initially, the state subsidized the conversion from wood-fired kilns to electric kilns, but few were willing to take the risk. Later, as firewood became scarce and expensive, electric kilns became more cost-effective and efficient, with a higher product rate. Thus, kiln owners rushed to make the switch, investing in kiln construction and wiring. Now, the county has built over 380 electric kilns, with 90% of the glazing processes using electricity, saving 66,000 cubic meters of firewood annually. Last year, Dehua produced over 100 million pieces of porcelain, accounting for nearly half of the county's industrial output value. Many family-owned porcelain factories also export their products overseas. Hydropower generation, electric kilns, thriving porcelain industry, lush forests... Dehua's forestry, electricity, and porcelain industries have all prospered, forming a unique cycle.

Yong'an, Dehua, Yuxi, and Yongchun are all among the first batch (100 counties) of pilot counties for initial rural electrification in the country. By the end of this year, the 10 pilot counties in Fujian will mainly rely on their own efforts to achieve and pass the assessment. Sha County, which is completely self-reliant, has recently been designated by the province as a “replacement county.”

Successful “Cascaded Development”

Fujian's approach to small hydropower is distinctive in its cascaded development on mountain streams, where the tailwater of an upstream power station becomes the intake water for a downstream station, fully utilizing the water resources. As we traveled upstream along the Jinsha River in Minqing County, we saw a small power station every one or two kilometers, with 17 stations along the 38-kilometer-long river!

In the counties we visited, such as Yuxi, Sha, Yong'an, Dehua, Datian, and Yongchun, this cascaded development is ubiquitous. Experts introduced that this indicates a shift from the initial spontaneous tendency of building power stations wherever it was convenient to a more scientific and rational development path in the 1980s. We observed two cascaded developments on the dividing ridge between Yuxi County and Sha County. At the top are the “heads” of each cascade: the Liutian Reservoir and the Guanchang Reservoir, responsible for regulating water volume during dry and wet seasons. Below the “heads,” the 40-kilometer-long Doushi River is divided into four levels, with a total drop of over 300 meters, except for 12 meters that could not be utilized due to the involvement of villages and roads, all other sections have been developed for power generation. Another “dragon,” the Qingyin River, is also planned in seven levels, with a utilization rate of over 90%.

The term “cascaded development” in hydropower has evolved into an important economic strategy. Using the policy of “self-construction, self-management, self-use” to mobilize the enthusiasm of various levels to build small hydropower, another form of “cascaded development” has emerged: counties, townships, villages, and households all contribute, each level developing separately. On the same river, it is common to see power stations built by counties, townships, villages, and joint households. Some cannot build alone, so they collaborate in pairs or trios, and some power-intensive enterprises also participate, with the public contributing labor if they lack funds. Counties like Sha, Yuxi, and Dehua have extended their “ladders” to attract investments from municipal, provincial, and even central government departments to build power stations together. Datian has even set its sights on overseas investments.

In Yong'an and Yongchun, we heard about a third “cascade”: regardless of how the county leadership changes, they all prioritize small hydropower construction, like a relay race, continuously leading the work without interruption, achieving today's results.

The fourth “cascaded development” is to use hydropower as the first step in the overall economic development, triggering a chain reaction: the rise of industries, agricultural progress, improved educational and cultural conditions, optimized ecological environment, improved living standards, and the attraction of foreign investment...

Small hydropower naturally brings benefits to rural areas first. In Minqing County, we visited a small village called Xinan. Surrounding a self-built power station, the village has established dozens of small factories for phosphate fertilizer, porcelain firing, chemical industry, machine bricks, cardboard boxes, automobile repair, and grain processing. Last year, the per capita income of the village exceeded 800 yuan. The village secretary led us from house to house, and every household had a television, electric rice cooker, and over 30 small loading machines for mushroom cultivation. Flipping through the power station's electricity bill book, the average household uses about 60-70 “units” per month, with the highest usage reaching over 200 “units.” The secretary said: His family has an air conditioner, the only one in the village. Without electricity, relying on an average of 4.4 mu of land per person, what would happen?

In Guikou Village, Yong'an City, the village secretary Jiang Zhengfu slammed a matchbox on the table, indignantly saying, “5 fen per degree, the electricity price is too low, not even worth a box of matches!” But he also admitted that for Guikou Village, which currently has no better way to make money, the self-built small power station is indeed a “money pot,” generating over 200,000 yuan in revenue annually, with a per capita income of over 300 yuan for the entire village. Therefore, they used the first “chicken” (the power station) to lay the foundation for the second power station.

After spending more than 10 days in the mountains of Minzhong, the footprint of electricity is everywhere. Surrounding each small power station is a small industrial zone, and each village has built a new cinema. Some extremely remote mountain-dwelling households also have electric lights, and a significant portion use electric rice cookers. Although it does not match well with the wooden houses and yellow mud walls, it is indeed a breath of modern civilization brought by the silver wires.

    流金淌银八闽溪
    ——记福建的农村小水电建设（上）
    吴锦才　宋红岗　吴长生
    福建山多水也多。道道清溪，滋润了沿途和海口的土地之后，归于大海。它的潜能长久未被认识。而今，通过追求农村电气化，昔日不起眼的水，被人们点化出如金赛银的价值。
                  缺油缺煤不等于缺能
    福建，天赋缺煤也缺油。发展经济的动力来源主要指望地面。地面资源中，可供普遍利用的主要就是水，年年月月流淌在千山万壑间的水。
    福建省水电厅的资料柜里，有一串串富有诱惑力的数字：全省流域面积在50平方公里以上的河溪有597条；全省年均降水量在1600毫米以上；普查得到的水能资源理论蕴藏量达1046万千瓦，可开发利用的有807万千瓦，居华东第一位；其中小水电资源占41％，达331万千瓦，差不多相当于葛洲坝水电站装机容量的一倍半……
    解放40年来，特别是改革10年来，福建的水电，尤其是小水电事业有了突飞猛进的发展。目前，全省100％的乡、95％的自然村和近90％的农户通了电，47个县、市（占总数的2／3以上）的用电主要靠小水电解决。8000多座小水电站像璀璨的明珠镶嵌在八闽的山水之间，平均每县120座；总装机容量达110多万千瓦，占全省水电装机的61％；年发电量占全省总发电量的1／3，已与大水电、火电，呈三足鼎立之势。
                    “要想变，先办电”
      “要想变，先办电。”这句话在福建流传很广。给我们留下极深印象的是，与其他许多地方不同，这里的大小决策者们不是急冲冲地“要电”，而是满口的“办电”。
    当然，正确的思维也是被“逼”出来的。
    已有数百年烧瓷历史的著名“瓷都”德化县，过去一直是以松木烧窑的，近年来部分改用煤、油，但木柴的消耗仍然不小。山上的树木越砍越少，生态环境恶化不说，连瓷这个经济优势也要保不住了。
    其实不光是地方经济，就是山区人的生活，也面临着同样的困扰。在尤溪县石路村，村支书陈世炳有这样一本账：平均每户生活用柴一年总得七八千公斤，全村75户，就是50多万公斤。树长得远没有烧得快。眼看着周围的山一天天秃了。
    正是这种最简单的维持生存、冀图发展的内在动力，催动了小水电建设的兴起。
    于是，合乎逻辑的决策出台了。早在10年前，永安市（当时是县）领导就确定了“水电牵头、开发石头、利用木头、发展山头、促进田头”的“五头”经济发展方针。尽管原县委书记袁启彤已离开永安六七年了，可时至今日，不少同志还绘声绘色地讲述他当年带着全县各级书记下水筑堰截流、修鸭姆潭电站的情景。“水电牵头”，领导带头，仅仅几年，永安就发生了大变化。小水电装机容量和年发电量，10年前在福建60多县只排第40位，如今它已“四连冠”，连续四年居全国2000多个县之榜首。在电的牵动下，“石头”等优势得到充分发挥，水泥、煤炭、冶炼……迅速发展起来，乡镇企业产值6年间增了7倍；市财政收入随之增加，跃居全省各县第一，而且超过了不少地市。
    德化瓷，也在一种新的循环中发展起来。开始时，国家贴钱改柴窑为电窑，都没多少人愿“冒险”。后来，林稀柴贵，而电烧瓷既省钱、省力，成品率又高，于是窑主们争先恐后地改起来，建窑、架线都舍得掏钱。现在，全县已建起电窑380多条，90％的烤花工艺都改用电能，一年可节柴6.6万立方米。去年德化产瓷1亿多件，产值占全县工业产值的近一半，许多家庭瓷厂的产品也飘洋出海了。水发电，电代柴，瓷业兴，山林茂，林养水……德化的林、电、瓷三业俱兴，形成了一个独特的循环圈。
    永安、德化、尤溪、永春，都属于全国第一批（100个）农村初步电气化试点县。到今年底，福建的10个试点县主要依靠自己力量相继达标通过验收。还有一个沙县完全是自力更生
  “挤”进试点县行列的，最近被省里定为“替补县”。
                  成功的“梯级开发”
    福建人搞小水电，最有特色的是在一条条山溪上进行“梯级开发”，上一级电站的尾水就是下一级的引水水头，头尾相接，水能被充分利用。记者溯闽清县的金沙溪而上，但见相隔一两千米就有一个小电站，38公里长的溪上竟“串”着17个！
    在记者所到的尤溪、沙县、永安、德化、大田、永春等县，这种“梯级开发”处处可见。行家介绍说：这表明，初期那种哪儿方便就在哪儿堵水发电的自发倾向已经扭转，80年代以来，小水电建设进入了科学规划、合理开发的轨道。我们看了尤溪县与沙县分水岭两侧的两个“梯级”。最上面是各自的
  “龙头”——柳塘水库和官昌水库，承担调节丰枯期水量任务。“龙头”以下，40公里的豆士溪被分为四级，300多米落差中，除12米因涉及村庄、公路未能利用，其余已全部开发发电。另一条“龙”青印溪也被规划为7级，开发利用率达90％以上。
      “梯级开发”这一水电专业术语，实际已演化为一种重要的经济方略。用“自建、自管、自用”方针调动各级多方的办电积极性，使小水电建设出现另一种“梯级开发”：县、乡、村、户，级级努力，分别开发。在同一条溪上，常常是县、乡、村、联户，各级办的电站都有。有的单独办不行，就二级或三级联手，一些用电多的企业也参加进来，群众没有钱就出力。沙县、尤溪、德化等县则把“梯子”越伸越长，吸引市、省、乃至中央部门，来投资合股办电。大田还把目光盯住了国外。
    在永安，在永春，我们还听到了第三个“梯级”：无论县领导怎么换届，都把小水电当大事来抓，就像接力赛一样，一届一届不断气地领着干，才取得了今天这样的成绩。
    第四个“梯级开发”，就是把水电当作经济全局发展的第一级台阶，引起二、三、四……各级联动：加工业兴起，农业进步，文教条件改善，生态环境优化，生活水平提高，外资也被纷纷引来……
    小水电，自然先给农村带来实惠。在闽清县，我们访问了一个叫溪南的小村。村里围绕一座自建的电站，办起了磷肥、烧瓷、化工、机砖、纸箱、汽车修配、粮食加工等几十个小厂。去年全村人均收入超过800元。村支书领着我们走家串户，家家都有电视机、电饭煲，还有30多台小型装料机，为种香菇配套的。翻翻电站收电费的本子，一般户月用电六七十个
  “字”，最多的户达200多个“字”。支书说：他家装了空调，独一份。如果没有电，只靠人均4分多地，会怎样呢？
    在永安市桂口村，村支书江正福往桌子上摔着火柴盒，忿忿地说：“5分一度，电价太低，还不如一盒火柴！”但他也承认，对目前还没有更好进钱门路的桂口村来说，依靠自己力量建起的小电站，还真是个“钱罐罐”，每年20多万收入，全村大小人均300多元哩。因此，他们又用第一只“母鸡”——电站下的“蛋”，铺第二座电站的摊子了。
    在闽中钻了10多天山沟，电的足迹随处可见。每座小电站的周围，都是一个小小的工业区，每个村子都新建了电影院。一些极偏僻的山间散居农户，也都点上了电灯，相当部分用上了电饭煲。尽管它与木板房、黄泥墙不那么协调，但毕竟是银线送去的一股现代文明的清风。（附图片）
