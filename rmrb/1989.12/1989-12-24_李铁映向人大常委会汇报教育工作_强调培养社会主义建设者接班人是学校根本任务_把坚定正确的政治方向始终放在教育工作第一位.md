Li Tieying Reports on Educational Work to the Standing Committee of the NPC
Emphasizes that Cultivating Socialist Builders and Successors is the Fundamental Task of Schools
Keeping a Firm and Correct Political Direction Always at the Forefront of Educational Work

New China News Agency, Beijing, December 23rd - The 11th session of the Standing Committee of the 7th National People's Congress was held this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People. Li Tieying, State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission, reported on several issues regarding China's educational work on behalf of the State Council.

In his report, Li Tieying emphasized that it is essential to adhere to the fundamental task of cultivating builders and successors for the socialist cause in schools. He stressed that maintaining a firm and correct political direction should always be the top priority in educational work. During the period of rectification and adjustment, educational work should focus more on adjusting internal structures and improving educational quality.

Wan Li, the Chairman of the Standing Committee, attended the plenary session. Peng Chong, Vice Chairman, presided over the meeting.

Li Tieying's report, approximately 10,000 words long, was divided into seven parts: 1. The Basic Situation of China's Educational Work; 2. The Issue of Adhering to the Socialist Direction of Education; 3. The Development Guidelines for Various Levels and Types of Education; 4. The Issue of Educational System Reform; 5. The Issue of Teacher Team Building; 6. The Issue of Educational Funding; 7. Several Specific Issues in Current Educational Work.

Li Tieying said that after the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion of this spring and summer, how to correctly assess the basic situation of China's educational work is a matter of concern for all sectors of society and an important basis for determining future work guidelines and tasks. Generally speaking, it is necessary to fully affirm the tremendous achievements of the educational cause over the past 40 years, especially in the past decade, to fully recognize the mistakes and existing problems in educational work, and to understand the urgency and difficulty of solving these problems.

When discussing the issue of adhering to the socialist direction of education, Li Tieying emphasized that throughout the entire period of modernization, the struggle for the educational front and the struggle for the younger generation will continue to exist and may sometimes be quite intense. International and domestic anti-socialist forces will always take advantage of China's reform and opening up and its focus on modernization to use various political, economic, and ideological and cultural means to infiltrate and deceive, leading to the spread of bourgeois liberalization. This will inevitably seriously erode the educational front. We must adhere to the Party's leadership in educational work, adhere to the socialist direction of education, and use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to educate students. We must adhere to the fundamental task of cultivating builders and successors for the socialist cause in schools and always place the firm and correct political direction at the forefront of educational work.

He said that in recent years, cadres, teachers, and staff at all levels of educational departments and schools have worked hard to implement the Party's and the state's educational policies, promote the Four Cardinal Principles, and promote reform and opening up. They have explored new ways to strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the new situation and have done a lot of work under difficult conditions. Regarding the spread of bourgeois liberalization, the majority of teachers have expressed dissatisfaction and concern, and many have resisted it. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the leadership of the vast majority of schools stood the test and actively worked on the front lines to maintain stability and unity, showing good and relatively good performance. However, in the previous period, some leaders of the Party Central Committee relaxed the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, weakened the Party's leadership and ideological and political work, and took a negative attitude towards the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, causing the struggle to be aborted several times. This put the struggle to adhere to Marxist education and oppose bourgeois liberalization in schools in a very difficult situation. Under these circumstances, due to our insufficient understanding and vigilance against the "peaceful evolution" plot of international opposing forces and the class struggle situation at home, we lacked experience in running socialist education under the conditions of reform and opening up and failed to consistently place the cultivation of builders and successors for the socialist cause in the primary position. Especially in practical work, measures were not effective enough, correct policy guidance was not implemented, academic requirements were practical, and political requirements were empty, leading to the weakening of moral education in schools. The State Education Commission is seriously reflecting on these problems, learning from the lessons, and ensuring that the fundamental task of rectifying the direction of running schools is implemented.

When discussing the development guidelines for various levels and types of education, Li Tieying said that in the next decade, China's educational cause should avoid large fluctuations in scale and speed and strive for sustained, stable, and coordinated development. The Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China should be implemented step by step to promote nine-year compulsory education and strengthen basic education. Vocational and technical education should be actively developed. The focus of higher education is to optimize the structure and improve the level. Adult education should focus on on-the-job training and vocational technical training.

When discussing educational reform, Li Tieying said that the Marxist principle of combining education with productive labor should be implemented to overcome the tendency to varying degrees of detachment from reality, detachment from workers and peasants, and detachment from productive labor. Primary and secondary schools should strengthen labor skill education and extracurricular practical activities. Higher education institutions should appropriately increase the proportion of students with practical experience and strengthen production internships and social practices. It is hoped that all sectors of society, especially enterprises and public institutions, will actively support and help schools solve practical difficulties encountered during student internships, reduce the fees charged as much as possible, and jointly shoulder the responsibility of cultivating qualified socialist builders.

When discussing the issue of educational funding, Li Tieying pointed out that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, educational funding has increased significantly, but China's educational funding still cannot meet the needs of the development of the educational cause. Solving the problem of educational funding requires starting from China's national conditions and gradually establishing and improving a new system of educational funding with fiscal appropriations as the main source and multiple channels for raising funds.

    李铁映向人大常委会汇报教育工作
    强调培养社会主义建设者接班人是学校根本任务
　  把坚定正确的政治方向始终放在教育工作第一位
    新华社北京12月23日电  七届全国人大常委会第11次会议今天下午在人民大会堂举行全体会，国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映受国务院委托在会上作了关于我国教育工作若干问题的汇报。
    李铁映在汇报中强调指出，必须坚持把培养社会主义事业的建设者和接班人作为学校工作的根本任务，坚持把坚定正确的政治方向始终放在教育工作的第一位。在治理整顿期间，教育工作要把更多的精力集中到调整内部结构，提高教育质量方面来。
    万里委员长出席了全体会，彭冲副委员长主持会议。
    李铁映的汇报约一万多字，分为七个部分：一、关于我国教育工作的基本状况；二、关于坚持教育的社会主义方向问题；三、关于各级各类教育事业的发展方针问题；四、关于教育体制改革问题；五、关于教师队伍建设问题；六、关于教育经费问题；七、关于当前教育工作中的几个具体问题。
    李铁映说，在发生了今年春夏之交的动乱和反革命暴乱之后，如何正确地估计我国教育工作的基本状况，这是社会各界关注的问题，也是确定今后工作方针和任务的重要依据。总的说，应当充分肯定40年来特别是近十年来教育事业的巨大成就，充分认识教育工作中的失误和存在的问题，以及解决这些问题的紧迫性和艰巨性。
    在谈到坚持教育的社会主义方向问题时，李铁映强调指出，在现代化建设的整个历史时期里，争夺教育阵地、争夺青年一代的斗争将长期存在，有时甚至是很激烈的。国际、国内的反社会主义势力，总是利用我国改革开放和集中精力进行现代化建设之机，采取政治的、经济的、思想文化的种种手段进行渗透、蛊惑，资产阶级自由化思潮的蔓延泛滥，必然会严重侵蚀教育阵地。我们必须坚持党对教育工作的领导，坚持教育的社会主义方向，坚持用马列主义、毛泽东思想教育学生，坚持把培养社会主义事业的建设者和接班人作为学校工作的根本任务，坚持把坚定正确的政治方向，始终放在教育工作的第一位。
    他说，近年来，各级教育部门和学校的干部、教职员工，努力贯彻党和国家的教育方针，宣传四项基本原则，宣传改革开放；探索新形势下加强和改进思想政治工作的途径，在艰苦的条件下做了大量工作；对于资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，广大教师表示不满和忧虑，许多同志还有所抵制；在动乱和反革命暴乱中，绝大多数学校的领导班子经受了严峻考验，为维护安定团结，站在第一线积极工作，表现是好的和比较好的。但是，前一个时期，党中央个别领导人放松社会主义精神文明建设、淡化党的领导和思想政治工作，消极对待反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，使斗争几次夭折，这使得学校坚持马克思主义教育、反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，处于十分困难的境地。在这种情况下，由于我们对国际反对势力“和平演变”的图谋和国内阶级斗争的状况认识和警惕不足，对于改革开放条件下办好社会主义教育缺乏经验，未能始终如一地把培养社会主义事业的建设者和接班人放在首要位置。尤其在实际工作中，措施不够得力，正确的政策导向不够落实，业务要求实、政治要求虚，学校德育受到削弱。国家教委对于这方面的问题正在认真反思，吸取教训，把端正办学方向这一根本大计落到实处。
    在谈到各级各类教育事业的发展方针时，李铁映说，今后十年内，我国教育事业在发展规模、速度上，应当避免大起大落，努力做到持续稳定协调发展。贯彻落实《中华人民共和国义务教育法》，有步骤地推进九年义务教育，切实加强基础教育。要积极发展职业和技术教育。高等教育的重点是优化结构，提高水平。成人教育要把开展岗位培训和职业技术培训作为重点。
    在谈到教学改革时，李铁映说，要贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的马克思主义原理，克服不同程度存在的脱离实际、脱离工农、脱离生产劳动的倾向。中小学要加强劳动技能教育和校外实践活动，高等学校要适当增加招收有实践经验的学生的比例，加强生产实习和社会实践。希望社会各方面尤其是企业、事业单位，积极支持，帮助学校解决学生实习中遇到的实际困难，尽量减少收取的费用，共同担负起培养社会主义建设合格人才的责任。
    在谈到教育经费问题时，李铁映指出，党的十一届三中全会以来，教育经费有了较大增长，但我国教育经费仍不能适应教育事业发展的需要。解决教育经费问题，要从我国国情出发，逐步建立和完善以财政拨款为主、多渠道筹措教育经费的新体制。
