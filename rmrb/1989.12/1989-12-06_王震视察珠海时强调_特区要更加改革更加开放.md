Xinhua News Agency, Zhuhai, December 5th. - People's Daily reporters Wang Chu and Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Yusheng report: Recently, Vice Chairman of the State Wang Zhen visited Zhuhai Special Economic Zone and repeatedly emphasized that the special zone must further reform and open up.

In recent days, despite being 82 years old, Wang Zhen visited islands, farmlands, mudflats, and construction sites, and went deep into rural areas to inspect factories. He held cordial discussions with Zhuhai's cadres, factory directors, workers, and farmers.

During the discussions, Wang Zhen highly praised the work of Zhuhai Special Economic Zone in various aspects. He said, "In recent years, I have visited Zhuhai many times, and Zhuhai's economic construction has developed at a surprising speed. The Zhuhai Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Government have resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of reform and opening up to the outside world. The leading cadre team of Zhuhai City is united and has fighting strength, and their work has achieved results. Especially after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Zhuhai's economic situation is stable."

Wang Zhen encouraged the cadres and the masses at every stop to closely unite around the third generation of the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin. He said, "Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasizes that the country needs stability. For the country to be stable, it must first be stable economically, which means insisting on reform and opening up, and this requires the whole country to be of one mind and unite."

In a small shed on the construction site of Zhuhai West District, the comprehensive planning model of energy and transportation deeply attracted Wang Zhen. He asked questions one by one. He said, "Your comprehensive planning is good. You rely on your own efforts and do not ask the state for money, which is in line with China's national conditions. But the key is to organize and implement it." He solemnly reminded the cadres of the special zone, "To build a place well, we must carry forward the spirit of moving mountains advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong. We must work hard and build the country with thrift. 'Serving the people' should be our spiritual pillar. Our cadres must have long-term plans, which is good for cadres, for the cause, and for the realization of long-term plans."

The development and construction of Zhuhai West District's Gaolan Island deep-water port, the supporting infrastructure of railways and expressways, and the repair and utilization of Sanzhao Airport will make the West District an important gateway for external transportation in Zhuhai and even South China, and an important distribution center for China's distant maritime trade. When Wang Zhen learned that Zhuhai West District had raised 1.6 billion yuan in one year, including attracting 70 million Hong Kong dollars in foreign investment, he was very pleased. He said, "The national economy is facing temporary difficulties, and you should try to use more foreign capital. Fully utilize the resource advantages and geographical advantages here, which is the key to accelerating the development of the West District."

During his inspection in Zhuhai, Wang Zhen repeatedly urged the leading cadres of Zhuhai Special Zone to seriously study Comrade Jiang Zemin's National Day speech and the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session to unify everyone's thinking. He said, "Further reform and opening up" is a strategic deployment proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in response to the situation and formulated by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The broad cadres and masses of the special zone, especially the leading cadres at all levels, should not wait and see in the process of rectification and deepening reform, but should resolutely implement it without hesitation.

    王震视察珠海时强调
    特区要更加改革更加开放
    本报珠海12月5日电　本报记者王楚、新华社记者张愈升报道：最近，国家副主席王震同志视察珠海经济特区时，再三强调，特区就是要更加改革、更加开放。
    连日来，王震同志不顾82岁高龄，上海岛、走垦区、看滩涂、到工地，深入农村，察看工厂。与珠海的干部、厂长、工人、农民亲切座谈。
    在座谈中，王震同志高度评价了珠海经济特区各方面工作。他说，近几年来，我多次来珠海，珠海经济建设以惊人的速度向前发展。珠海市委、市人民政府坚决贯彻执行了党中央对外改革开放政策。珠海市的领导班子是团结的，是有战斗力的，工作是有成绩的。特别是平息北京反革命暴乱后，珠海的经济形势是稳定的。
    王震同志每到一处，总是勉励干部群众紧密团结在以江泽民同志为核心的党中央第三代领导集体周围。他说，江泽民同志强调国家要稳定。国家要稳定，首先是经济上要稳定发展，这就是要坚持改革开放，这就要全国上下一条心，团结起来。
    在珠海西区建设工地的一间工棚内，能源、交通总体规划模型深深吸引了王震同志。他逐一询问。他说，你们的总体规划很好。你们自力更生，不向国家伸手要钱，这符合中国国情。但关键在于去组织落实。他语重心长地告诫特区的干部，建设好一个地方，要发扬毛泽东同志倡导的愚公移山的精神。要艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国。“为人民服务”应作为我们的精神支柱。我们的干部一定要有长期打算，这样，对干部、对事业，对实现长远规划都有好处。
    珠海西区高栏岛深水港开发和建设，铁路、高速公路的配套，三灶机场的修复利用，将使西区成为珠海以至华南地区对外交通的重要门户，是中国南部远洋贸易的重要集散地。当王震同志得知珠海西区在一年的时间里，已集资1.6亿元，其中，引进外资7000多万港元，他很高兴。他说，国家经济遇到暂时困难，你们要尽量多地利用外资。充分利用这里的资源优势、地理优势，这是加快西区发展的关键。
    在珠海视察期间，王震同志多次要珠海特区的领导干部，认真学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话和五中全会精神，以此统一大家的思想。他说，“更加改革开放”，是邓小平同志审时度势提出的，是江泽民同志为核心的党中央制定的战略部署，特区广大干部群众，特别是各级领导干部，在治理整顿、深化改革进程中，不能等待、观望，应毫不犹豫地带头坚决贯彻执行。
