Title: U.S. Navy Accidents Pile Up

Recently, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy ordered all naval units to conduct a three-day safety inspection to reduce the occurrence of accidents. This is because the U.S. Navy has recently experienced a series of major accidents:

On November 5, a naval lieutenant pilot, Pang Tai'er, was flying a T-2 "Oak" twin-seat trainer aircraft on the "Lexington" aircraft carrier when he unfortunately collided with the control tower. The aircraft then flipped over into the space between two aircraft parked on the deck, causing a massive fire. Pang Tai'er and four crew members of the aircraft carrier were killed on the spot, and two sailors were injured.

What went wrong? One possible explanation is that modern physiology research has found that when a pilot lands an aircraft on an aircraft carrier deck, the heart rate increases dramatically, even faster than in aerial combat. The pilot's target is the four arresting wires at the tail of the ship. When landing, the tail hook catches one of these wires, and the aircraft lands on the deck with a thud. If the deck seen from the air is compared to a maple leaf, then the four arresting wires are not as thick as the leaf veins. It is clear that in high-speed impact, accurately hooking onto the wires is not an easy task. The enormous forward thrust during landing can almost cause the pilot to suffocate under the seatbelt. However, the pilot still needs to increase the aircraft's power to the maximum to ensure that if the hook does not catch the wires or the wires break, the aircraft can take off again and land, rather than sliding off the entire deck and plunging into the sea. Even if everything goes smoothly, landing a jet fighter on an aircraft carrier is no ordinary feat. It is said that even in peacetime, the fatality rate for jet fighter pilots serving in the navy for twenty years is as high as one in four.

On November 6, during an exercise in the Indian Ocean, an FA-18 "Hornet" fighter jet that took off from the "Midway" aircraft carrier mistook the "Reeves" missile cruiser of the Leahy class for a target ship still five miles away and dropped a 500-pound bomb, blowing a 1.5-meter hole in the main deck of the ship. Five crew members were injured. In the early hours of November 7, about 150 kilometers off the coast of Northern California, giant waves swept onto the deck of the "Eisenhower" aircraft carrier, sweeping three sailors into the sea. Two were rescued, and one died. Additionally, eighteen AIM-7 "Sparrow" air-to-air missiles and twenty AIM-9 "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles were swept into the sea. On November 8, the "Monongahela" oil tanker caught fire, and nine crew members were injured from inhaling thick smoke.

Not long ago, the mysterious explosion on the "Iowa" battleship that killed forty-seven people is still fresh in people's minds. Now, within a few days, these accidents have occurred again, and the official explanation is still unclear.

    美国海军事故迭出
    最近，美国海军部长命令海军所有部队用三天时间进行安全检查，以减少事故的发生。这是因为近来美国海军接连发生重大事故：
    十一月五日，海军少尉飞行员庞太尔驾驶T—2双座“橡树”教练机在“列克星敦”号航空母舰上降落时，不幸撞上了塔台，最后侧翻进停在甲板上的两架飞机之间，引起熊熊大火。他本人及航空母舰的舰员四人当即死亡，另有两名水手受伤。
    问题到底出在哪里？一个可能的答案是，现代生理学研究发现，飞行员驾机在航空母舰甲板上降落时，脉搏急剧加快，其速率就是在空战中都无法相比。飞行员的目标，是舰尾四条绊索，降落时，机尾钩挂住这四条绊索之一，飞机便砰然降落在甲板上。如果把飞行员在空中能够看到的飞行甲板比作一片枫叶，那么飞行员所能看到的四条绊索还不如叶脉粗。可见在高速冲击下，准确无误地挂上绊索，确非易事。降落时巨大的前冲力能使驾驶员几乎在安全带下窒息，他却仍需将飞机马力加到最大，以便在没有钩住绊索，或绊索拉断时，飞机可以升空再降一次，而不至于冲过整个甲板，一头栽进海里。在这个过程中，即使一切操作顺利，喷气战斗机在航空母舰上降落也是非同寻常的。据说，即使在和平时期，在海军服役二十年的喷气式飞机驾驶员，殉职的比例也高达一比四。
    六日，在印度洋进行的演习中，从“中途岛”号航空母舰上起飞的一架FA—18“大黄蜂”战斗机在进行夜间轰炸演习时，将莱希级导弹巡洋舰“里夫斯”号误认为尚在五英里之外的靶船，投下了一枚五百磅炸弹，将舰只主甲板炸开了一个一点五米的大洞，有五名舰员受伤。七日凌晨，在北加利福尼亚海岸外约一百五十公里处，巨浪卷上了“艾森豪威尔”号航空母舰的甲板，把三名水手卷进了大海，其中二名获救，一名遇难，另有十八枚AIM—7“海麻雀”空—空导弹和二十枚AIM—9“响尾蛇”空—空导弹被卷进大海。八日，“莫纳加赫拉”号油船失火，有九名船员因吸入浓烟受伤。
    不久前，“依阿华”号战列舰神秘爆炸而死亡四十七人的严重事故，人们还记忆犹新。现在在短短几天内又发生了这些事故，官方还未能作出确切的解释。　陈林海　吴新正
