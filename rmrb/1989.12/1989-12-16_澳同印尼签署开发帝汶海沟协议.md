Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gareth John Evans, and Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, signed an agreement on the 11th in Canberra for the joint development and management of oil resources in the Timor Trench. This agreement paves the way for both countries to develop the oil resources in this region. The Timor Trench is located in the Timor Sea between Timor Island and northwestern Australia. Geological surveys indicate that this region may contain approximately one billion barrels of oil.

The Timor Trench was overlooked during the demarcation of maritime boundaries between Australia and Indonesia ten years ago.

    澳同印尼签署开发帝汶海沟协议
    澳大利亚外交和贸易部长加雷思·约翰·埃文斯和印度尼西亚外长阿里·阿拉塔斯十一日在堪培拉签署了两国合作开发管理帝汶海沟石油资源协议，为两国开发这一地区的石油扫清了道路。帝汶海沟位于帝汶岛和澳大利亚西北之间的帝汶海里。地质勘探表明，这一地区可能蕴藏有十亿桶左右的石油。
    帝汶海沟在十年前澳、印尼两国划定海域边界时被遗漏。
