On the morning of the 17th, President Yang Shangkun departed from Beijing by special plane and made a brief stop in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. On the 18th at noon, President Yang's special plane took off from Sharjah, flying over the vast Arabian Desert and across the sparkling Red Sea, and landed in Cairo, the capital of the "Land of the Pyramids," beginning his official friendly visit to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman.

When President Yang stepped off the plane, President Mubarak walked forward to greet him with a warm handshake. The hands of the two leaders from China and Egypt were tightly clasped together, once again demonstrating the deep and sincere friendship between the two ancient nations.

Today, this city of nearly a million people, the largest in Africa, Cairo, is bathed in brilliant sunshine and gentle breezes. The fine weather has made the festive atmosphere of the Egyptian people welcoming the Chinese guests even more lively and rich.

China and Egypt are both cradles of ancient human civilization. Although separated by mountains and seas, traditional friendship binds the peoples of the two countries closely together. In the African and Arab countries, Egypt was the first to establish diplomatic relations with China. Over the past 30 years, the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Egypt has continued to develop. President Mubarak is an old friend of the Chinese people. He has had cordial meetings with Chairman Mao Zedong and held talks with Comrade Deng Xiaoping, holding special feelings for China. In 1986, Chairman Li Xiannian visited Egypt. Three years later, President Yang Shangkun also came to the banks of the Nile, bringing the friendship of the Chinese people.

President Yang's visit to the four Asian and African countries comes at a time of changing international circumstances. In early June this year, the Chinese government took decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and some Western countries exerted political and economic pressure on China, interfering in China's internal affairs. However, the Egyptian government clearly expressed its full understanding of the Chinese government. In September, President Mubarak received Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and expressed his satisfaction and high praise for China's political and economic stability and development, and once again invited President Yang Shangkun to visit Egypt before the end of the year. Youssef Wali, Secretary-General of the ruling National Democratic Party and Vice Prime Minister of Egypt, said that Egypt understands and supports the recent actions taken by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government in handling their internal affairs. Egyptian Foreign Minister Maguid said that it is unacceptable for some Western countries to interfere in China's internal affairs; they do not seek to understand the truth but to harm China on the basis of errors. No country allows a state of chaos to exist, and Egypt fully understands what has happened in China. If not for the shared fragrance of orchids, how could there be a shared heart? The remarks of the Egyptian leaders once again embody the true friendship between China and Egypt.

The reporter learned that before President Yang's visit, the Chinese government had agreed to use the remaining balance of the interest-free loan from 1964 to build a 10,000-seat indoor stadium in Cairo, with construction scheduled to begin in early next year. Currently, five Chinese companies have set up offices in Egypt, undertaking nearly 20 construction projects. Engineer Bahah and Miss Haina, who speaks fluent Chinese, both hope that the economic and trade cooperation between China and Egypt will have new developments.

When the reporter visited the Chinese Department at Ain Shams University, not far from the Cairo International Conference Center, the students and teachers were very excited to hear that President Yang was visiting from afar. This is the only university in Africa with a Chinese Department, with 60 students learning Chinese, 30 teaching assistants, 13 associate professors, and 5 professors. Many of them have been to China, climbed the Great Wall, and strolled around Wangfujing. Recently, the Chinese government decided to provide new equipment and Chinese language books to this university, expanding it into a Chinese language teaching center for the entire African continent. During President Yang's visit, the students' self-organized "Great Wall of China House" will hold a special lecture to introduce Chinese culture and history. There is reason to believe that as time goes by, the economic and cultural ties between China and Egypt will become increasingly deep and broad.

Tonight, the Egyptian Presidential Palace is brightly lit. President Mubarak held a grand welcome banquet for the visiting President Yang Shangkun. Friends from China and Egypt gathered together, and their topics of conversation were naturally about wishing for the further development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

    交同兰气　话出一心
    本报记者　成元生　林皎明
    17日上午，国家主席杨尚昆乘专机从北京起程后，在阿联酋的沙迦稍事停留。18日中午，杨主席的专机从沙迦升空，飞越浩瀚的阿拉伯半岛大沙漠，穿过波光粼粼的红海，降落在“金字塔王国”首都开罗，开始对埃及、阿联酋、科威特和阿曼等亚非四国的正式友好访问。
    当杨主席走下专机时，穆巴拉克总统迎上去同他热情握手。中埃两国元首的手紧紧握在一起，再次表明中埃两个古老民族悠久深厚的真挚情意。
    今天，这座拥有近千万人口的非洲第一大城市开罗，阳光灿烂，和风吹拂。这晴好的天气把埃及朋友欢迎中国贵宾的节日气氛酿得更加热烈醇厚。
    中国和埃及同为人类古文明的发祥地，两国虽然隔山隔海，但传统的友谊把两国人民紧紧联在一起。在非洲和阿拉伯国家中，埃及是第一个与我国建交的国家。30多年来中埃两国友好合作关系不断发展。穆巴拉克总统是中国人民的老朋友。他曾与毛泽东主席亲切会见，与邓小平同志进行过会谈，对中国怀有特殊的感情。1986年，李先念主席访问埃及。3年后的今天，杨尚昆主席也来到尼罗河畔，带来了中国人民的友情。
    杨主席此次亚非四国之行，正当在国际形势风云变幻。今年6月初，我国政府采取果断措施平息反革命暴乱后，某些西方国家对中国施加政治、经济压力，干涉中国内政。但埃及政府却态度鲜明地对我国政府表示充分理解。穆巴拉克总统9月接见钱其琛外长时，对中国政治经济稳定发展表示高兴，给予高度评价，并再次邀请杨尚昆主席年底前访问埃及。埃及执政党民族民主党总书记、副总理优素福·瓦利说，埃及理解和支持中国共产党和中国政府最近在处理他们的内政时所采取的行动。埃及外长马吉德说，西方某些国家干涉中国内政是不允许的，它们不是去了解真相而是在错误的基础上去伤害中国。任何国家都不允许混乱状态存在，埃及完全理解中国所发生的事情。若非交同兰气味，如何话出同一心。埃及领导人的这些讲话，再次体现了中埃两国是真正的朋友。
    记者了解到，杨主席来访前夕，中国政府已同意利用1964年无息贷款的余额在开罗建筑一座万人室内体育馆，明年初即将动工。目前，中国有5家公司在埃及设立办事处，承包近20项建筑工程。巴哈工程师与操一口流利汉语的海娜小姐都希望，中埃两国的经济贸易合作关系将有新的发展。
    记者在离开罗国际会议中心不远的艾因·夏姆斯大学中文系采访时看到，那里的师生听说杨主席远道来访，心情十分激动。这所非洲大陆唯一设有中文系的大学，现有学汉语学生60名，助教30人，副教授13人，教授5人。其中很多人到过中国，登过长城，逛过王府井。最近，中国政府决定向这所大学提供新设备和汉语书籍，把它扩建成面向整个非洲的汉语教学中心。杨主席来访期间，学生自己组织的“中国长城之家”要举行专题讲座，介绍中国文化、历史概况。人们有理由相信，随着时日推移，中埃两国的经济和文化联系将愈加深入广泛。
    今晚的埃及总统府灯光辉煌。穆巴拉克总统为来访的杨尚昆主席举行盛大欢迎宴会。中埃两国朋友欢聚一堂，其话题当然是共祝两国友好合作关系进一步发展。
