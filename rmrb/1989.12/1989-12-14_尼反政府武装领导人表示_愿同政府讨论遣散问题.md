Tegucigalpa, December 12th - The leader of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, Enrique Bermúdez, stated today that he is willing to engage in dialogue with the Nicaraguan government regarding the issue of demobilization.

Bermúdez said, "We are prepared to disband, and it would be even better if the demobilization deadline could be set for March 12th of next year. However, the Sandinista government must adhere to the agreement reached by the five presidents in August in Tela, providing us with economic and political guarantees upon our return." He expressed that the anti-government forces are ready to discuss and negotiate specific issues with the Sandinista government at any time, as long as they are willing.

    尼反政府武装领导人表示
    愿同政府讨论遣散问题
    据新华社墨西哥城12月12日电　特古西加尔巴消息：尼加拉瓜反政府武装领导人恩里克·贝穆德斯今天表示，愿意同尼政府就遣散问题进行对话。
    贝穆德斯说，“我们准备解散，如果能把遣散期限定在明年3月12日则更好，但桑地诺政府必须遵守5国总统今年8月在特拉达成的协议，对我们返国提供经济和政治保障。”他表示，只要桑地诺政府愿意，反政府武装随时准备同其就一些具体问题进行讨论和谈判。
