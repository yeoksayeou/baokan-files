According to a report published today in the *Market News*, the number of distilleries in Sichuan Province has significantly decreased this year, with nearly 5000 closing down. Among the remaining 5000 distilleries, only two-thirds are able to maintain normal production.

How should we view this change in Sichuan's liquor industry? *Market News* analyzes that among the closed distilleries, more than two-thirds are individually-owned and small township distilleries. These distilleries have small scales, low production, and outdated technology. After a large number of them closed down, they freed up raw materials, allowing previously under-supplied state-owned large distilleries to produce normally. Despite the reduction in the number of distilleries by half, the province's liquor production has remained basically stable. Relevant officials believe this is a good start for the healthy development of the liquor industry.

The closure of a large number of small distilleries also provides an opportunity to adjust the structure of liquor products. According to Sichuan Province's statistics for the first eight months of this year, the production of grain-intensive, wasteful traditional white liquor has decreased by 35,000 tons, while the production of high-quality liquor has significantly increased. At the same time, since the eliminated small distilleries were mostly low-tax or tax-evading entities, the tax revenue from the province's distilleries has not decreased, and the tax revenue from famous liquor brands is on the rise.

*Market News* published an editorial on this issue: "Protect what should be protected, and suppress what should be suppressed." The editorial states that in recent years, the production of white liquor in China has been out of control, consuming 12.5 million tons of grain last year, equivalent to one month's ration for urban and rural residents nationwide. Cutting down on those small distilleries that waste a lot of resources has been a long-standing hope of the people and a requirement for the healthy development of the economy. Only by firmly supporting the best and eliminating the worst can economic efficiency be improved.

### 四川淘汰近5000小酒厂  全省产量稳定  上缴税收未减

    四川淘汰近5000小酒厂
    全省产量稳定
    上缴税收未减
    本报讯　据今天出版的《市场报》报道：四川省酿酒厂今年明显减少，目前已有近5000家倒闭。在尚存的5000家中，也只有2／3能维持正常生产。
    如何看待四川制酒业的这一变化？《市场报》分析说，在倒闭的酒厂中，2／3以上是个体和乡镇小酒厂。这些酒厂规模小，产量低，工艺落后，大量倒闭后，让出了原料，使原来吃不饱的国营大厂能正常生产。尽管酒厂减了一半，全省的酒产量却保持了基本稳定。有关人士认为，这是制酒业健康发展的良好开端。
    大批小酒厂倒闭也为调整酒类产品结构提供了好机会。据四川省今年1—8月的统计，耗粮多、浪费大的土法白酒产量减少了3.5万吨，而优质酒产量则明显上升。与此同时，由于被淘汰的小酒厂多是些利税小户或逃税户，全省酒厂上缴的税收并未减少，名酒厂家的利税呈上升趋势。
    《市场报》为此发表社论：该保则保，该压则压。社论说，近几年，我国白酒生产失控，去年耗粮达1250万吨，相当于全国城乡居民一个月的口粮。砍掉那些浪费严重的小酒厂是人们早已提出的希望，也是经济健康发展的要求。只有坚决扶优汰劣，经济效益才能提高。
