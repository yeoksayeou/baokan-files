Jiangsu Sihong Alcohol Factory (formerly Jiangsu Sihong Shuanggou Alcohol Factory Branch) is a medium-sized enterprise with an annual alcohol production of 23,000 tons and 1,800 employees. The leadership team of this factory, in the face of growing economic benefits and a constant stream of visitors seeking favors, has always regarded anti-corruption efforts as the foundation of the factory's integrity.

During a business trip in April, a driver from Jiangsu Sihong Alcohol Factory suddenly asked the factory director, Zhang Baomin, "Do you remember the incident at the beginning of the year when someone sent you ten boxes of Zhonghua cigarettes?" Zhang replied, "How could I forget? I returned them on the spot." The driver, blushing, said, "That was sent by me. I was transferred back to Sihong from another province, spending over 2,000 yuan in the process, but you didn't take a single penny."

In fact, such incidents have happened countless times to Zhang Baomin. At the beginning of this year, a friend of Zhang's eagerly came to his office and said, "I have 300,000 jin of dried potatoes. If you can get the factory to buy them all, we can make 30,000 yuan, and I'll give you 15,000 yuan." Zhang bluntly replied, "I won't do that!" The man became agitated, "Why turn down money? You're being foolish!" Zhang Baomin coldly said, "I'm not the kind of person who is blinded by money." He refused the deal on the spot. Later, Zhang said, "To achieve something, integrity is essential!" This was his sincere belief and the actual practice of the factory's leadership team.

Once, Party Secretary Fu Chengqing's hometown acquaintance came to sell 500,000 jin of sorghum to the alcohol factory. Seeing that it met the purchasing standards, Fu agreed to buy it. A few days later, this acquaintance gave Fu 2,000 yuan, saying, "This is a token of appreciation." Fu sternly replied, "What are you doing? Do you think my 30 years in the Party are worth 2,000 yuan? Take your money back!" In August, the alcohol factory underwent major equipment repairs and ordered a valve from a factory. Later, the valve factory secretly gave kickbacks of 2,100 yuan to the deputy director in charge, Chen Xuejian, and the production assistant, Li Shixi. Both immediately reported the incident and turned over the money to the organization.

The deputy party secretary, financial deputy director, and union chairman of this factory have also refused gifts and turned over money. Since October 1984, the "Gift Refusal Registry" at this factory has recorded nearly 200 instances of the leadership team refusing or turning over gifts, including color TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, various local specialties, and large sums of cash, totaling over 50,000 yuan.

Another important manifestation of the clean and upright leadership of this factory is their adherence to the ancient adage, "To correct one's shadow, one must straighten one's form; to ensure the subordinates are upright, one must lead by example." They strictly adhere to the "five don'ts": not abusing power, not arbitrarily allocating alcohol, and not arbitrarily arranging for relatives to work in the factory. Factory Director Zhang Baomin has repeatedly rejected over 200 requests from relatives and friends to work in the factory, earning him the reputation of being "unyielding to kin." The factory's main product, "Sihong Special Brew," is popular, and each ton of alcohol can earn 400 yuan with a single transaction. The factory leadership insists on not issuing preferential vouchers for relatives.

In the face of temptations of money and gifts, the leadership team of Sihong Alcohol Factory has been steadfast in preventing corruption and maintaining integrity. The leadership team is stable and united, achieving significant economic benefits. Despite the general decline in white alcohol production nationwide this year, the factory has maintained a good upward trend, becoming one of the best-performing factories in Huaiyin, known as the "alcohol town." The factory has been consecutively named a civilized unit by Huaiyin City for four years and has been awarded a first-class collective merit.

    正气凛然
    ——江苏泗洪酒厂廉政建设二三事
    鲁子
    江苏省泗洪酒厂（原江苏省泗洪双沟酒厂分厂）是一个年产酒二万三千吨、拥有职工一千八百人的中等企业。这个厂的领导班子在经济效益连年增长，每天上门买酒、卖原料、学技术等求情者络绎不绝的情况下，始终把廉政建设作为工厂的立身之本。
    今年四月的一次出差途中，江苏省泗洪酒厂的一位司机突然问厂长张保民：“你还记得年初有人送你十条大中华香烟的事吗？”“怎么不记得，我当场就退回去了。”司机红着脸说：“那是我托人送给你的。我从外省调回泗洪，前后花了两千多元，想不到你这一关竟然一分钱没花。”
    其实，像这样的事，对张保民来说，说不清有多少次了。今年年初，张保民的一位朋友兴冲冲地找上门来说：
  “我搞了三百万斤山芋干，只要你让厂里全部收下，咱们可以赚三万元，分给你一万五千元。”张直言相告：“这种事我不干！”那人急了：“放着票子不要，你这不是犯傻吗？”张保民冷冷地说：“我不是那种见钱眼开的人。”当场拒绝了这笔交易。事后张保民说：“要想干一番事业，清白绝不可少！”这是他的由衷之言，也是这个厂领导一班人的实际行动。
      一次，党委书记傅承清老家来人要向酒厂出售五十多万斤高粱。老傅见符合收购标准，便同意收下。事过几天，这个熟人对老傅说：“这是二千元钱，送给你表表心意。”老傅正色道：“你这是干什么？我三十年党龄难道就值两千元？你快把钱拿走！”今年八月，酒厂设备大修，订购了一个阀门厂的货。事后该厂私下送给主管此事的副厂长陈学健和生产助理李士侠回扣两千一百元。两人立即如实汇报，全部上交给组织。
    这个厂的党委副书记、财务副厂长、工会主席等人，也都拒收过财礼，上交过财物。从一九八四年十月到现在，在这个厂“拒财礼登记册”上，已登记在册的领导班子成员拒收、上交财礼一百九十多起，其中有彩电、冰箱、洗衣机、各种土特产及高额现金，价值逾五万余元。
    这个厂领导班子清正廉洁的另一个重要表现，是恪守“欲影正者端其表，欲下廉者先之身”的古训，以不滥用职权、不乱批酒、不随意安排亲戚进厂等“五不”自律。厂长张保民曾先后回绝了二百多人次亲朋好友要求进厂的请求，至今背着“六亲不认”的名声。该厂主产品“泗洪特酿”畅销，每吨酒一转手即可得四百元。该厂领导坚持对亲属一律不批照顾条子。
    在金钱财礼考验面前，泗洪酒厂一班人防腐反贪，清廉为本，领导班子稳定团结，取得了明显的经济效益。在今年全国白酒行业生产普遍滑坡的情况下，这个厂仍然保持良好的上升趋势，成为淮阴酒乡经济效益最好的厂家之一。连续四年被淮阴市评为文明单位，荣立集体一等功。
