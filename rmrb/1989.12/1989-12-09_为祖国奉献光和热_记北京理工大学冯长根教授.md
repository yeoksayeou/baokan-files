On the evening of October 1st this year, against the backdrop of a city illuminated with fireworks, a young professor was being interviewed by a reporter from China Central Television. Thousands of compatriots heard him say, "Everything I have achieved belongs to the motherland and the people. Without the motherland and the people, I would have nothing."

He is Professor Feng Changgen of Beijing Institute of Technology, who was selected as one of the "Ten Outstanding Youth" by the magazine *China Youth* and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation this year.

In 1979, Feng Changgen was admitted to the University of Leeds in the UK with excellent grades to pursue a PhD. During his time studying abroad, he deeply felt the differences in political, economic, and social systems, as well as in educational and scientific research systems. However, all these experiences strengthened his resolve to use his knowledge to build a more beautiful and advanced motherland.

Not only did he excel in his PhD coursework, but he also participated in several international academic conferences. Eleven of his papers were published in influential international academic journals. In 1983, when he completed his PhD thesis, which contained four years of hard work, he wrote in both Chinese and English on the title page: "This thesis is dedicated to my motherland – the People's Republic of China." That December, just days before the PhD conferment ceremony, he boarded a plane back to the motherland.

After returning to China, he devoted all his energy to teaching and research. In his first year back, he taught three courses and tutored young and middle-aged teachers in English conversation, teaching five or six classes per week, and also wrote teaching materials. An elderly professor had been teaching "Theory of Thermal Explosion" to graduate students but had to stop for over a year due to illness. Feng took over the course after minimal preparation.

Feng Changgen's main research area is the theory of thermal ignition, a relatively new field in China. Compared to developed countries abroad, our research conditions and funding are inadequate. However, he believes, "Our generation's mission is to narrow the gap between China and developed countries, including in scientific research."

With the support and help of his department leaders, he soon obtained a research grant from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and accepted three research projects within less than a year. Over the years, he has published more than 40 papers on the theory of thermal explosion and published the monograph *Theory of Thermal Explosion*. These achievements have wide-ranging applications in combustion, explosion, chemical engineering, heat transfer, and safety engineering. Due to his creative research on the theory of thermal explosion, he has improved the classical theory of thermal explosion. Especially, he used modern mathematics and computers to process the critical conditions and delay periods of thermal explosions under various conditions, earning him the title of "the first person in China to systematically study the theory of thermal explosion."

His achievements have won him recognition and praise from society. In 1986, he was awarded the first Beijing "Youth Science and Technology Award"; in 1987, he received the Youth Research Fund from the Chinese Academy of Sciences; in 1988, he was awarded the first "National Young Teacher Award" by the Ho Ying Tung Education Foundation and the first "Youth Science and Technology Award" by the China Association for Science and Technology. Facing the continuous honors, Feng Changgen said, "This makes me more confident that I am on the right path. My research specialty is the theory of thermal explosion. In the future, I will release all my light and heat for the modernization of our socialist motherland."

    为祖国奉献光和热
    ——记北京理工大学冯长根教授
    安万林
    今年10月1日晚上，在“火树银花不夜天”的背景前，一位年轻的教授接受着中央电视台记者的采访。成千上万的同胞听到他说：“我取得的一切都属于祖国和人民，没有祖国和人民，就没有我的一切。”
    他，就是今年被《中国青年》杂志和团中央、全国青联分别选进“青年十杰”的北京理工大学冯长根教授。
    1979年，冯长根以优异的成绩考进英国利兹大学，攻读博士学位。在异国留学的日子里，他深切体会到不同的政治、经济、社会制度，以及不同的教育科研制度方面的差异，但所有这些使他更坚定了一个信念，即用自己所学的知识把祖国建设得更美好、更先进。
    他不仅出色地完成了博士课程的学业，而且多次参加国际学术会议，11篇论文先后在有影响的国际学术刊物上发表。1983年，当他完成了饱含4年心血的博士论文时，他提笔用中、英两种文字在扉页上写道：“本论文献给我的祖国——中华人民共和国。”这年12月，他刚刚通过论文答辩，放弃了还有几天就要举行的博士学位授予典礼，毅然登上返回祖国的飞机。
    回国后，他把全部精力投入到教学和科研中去。回国的第一年，他就开了3门课，同时为中青年教师辅导英语口语，每周上五六次课，还编写了教材。一位老教授原来给研究生讲授“热爆炸理论”，因患病停课一年多，他稍经准备就重新开出了这门课。
    冯长根主要研究方向是热自燃理论，这在我国还是一个年轻的领域。比起国外发达国家，我们的研究条件差，经费不足，但他认为：“我们这一代人的使命就是缩小中国和发达国家之间的差距，其中也包括科研方面的差距。”
    在校系领导的支持和帮助下，不久，他就得到了中国科学院的科学基金，不到一年就接受了3个研究课题。几年来，他在热爆炸理论方面发表了40余篇论文，并出版了专著《热爆炸理论》，这些成果在燃烧、爆炸、化工、传热和安全工程中有着广泛的应用意义。由于他对热爆炸理论创造性的研究，完善了经典的热爆炸理论，特别是他运用现代数学和计算机等先进手段，对各种条件热爆炸临界条件和延滞期做了大量的数学处理，被誉为“我国系统研究热爆炸理论的第一人”。
    他的成就赢得了社会的承认和人们的赞誉。1986年，他荣获首届北京“青年科技奖”；1987年，获中国科学院颁发的青年奖励研究基金；1988年，又获霍英东教育基金会首届“全国高等院校青年教师奖”及中国科学技术协会首届“青年科技奖”。面对着接踵而来的荣誉，冯长根说：“这使我更加坚信我的路走对了，我的研究专业是热爆炸理论，今后，我要为社会主义祖国的现代化释放出我全部的光和热”。
