To cultivate in children from a young age the virtues of hard work, perseverance, and thrift, the Bank of China's Hebei Province Yangyuan County branch recently established "Little Red Guard Savings Banks" in four primary schools in the county seat. Young students are saving their pocket money, bit by bit, in these small banks.
