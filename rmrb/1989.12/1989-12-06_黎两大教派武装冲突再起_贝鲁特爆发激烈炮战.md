**Renewed Armed Clashes Between Two Major Sects in Lebanon**
**Beirut Witnesses Intense Artillery Battle**

Beirut: Lebanon's capital, Beirut, witnessed intense artillery battles today. Residents are in a state of extreme panic, fearing a full-scale military confrontation between the opposing factions in Lebanon.

The artillery battle, which lasted for more than two hours, took place between the Christian militia loyal to General Aoun and the Muslim militias supported by Syria. Both sides used a variety of light and heavy weapons, including anti-tank rockets.

According to security personnel in Beirut, Aoun's forces received support from the largest Christian militia organization, the "Lebanese Forces."

However, the Syrian troops deployed near the presidential palace in East Beirut did not intervene in this artillery battle.

The roar of artillery in Beirut plunged the city's residents into extreme panic. Pedestrians scattered in all directions, causing traffic chaos. Shops closed one after another.

This is the most intense artillery battle since the end of the half-year-long artillery battle between the conflicting parties on September 23. The casualty situation is still unclear.

Shortly after Lebanon's new president, Hariri, was elected on November 24, he threatened to use force to drive Aoun out of the presidential palace in Baabda. Syria simultaneously increased its troops in Beirut. The 20,000 troops loyal to Aoun were also in a state of combat readiness. Both sides' military forces were in a tense standoff, with swords drawn. This artillery battle erupted under such circumstances.

Meanwhile, General Aoun, who was dismissed by President Hariri, reiterated in an interview with a British radio station today that he would rather die in battle than surrender Baabda, and insisted on his stance of not recognizing the new Hariri government.

    黎两大教派武装冲突再起
    贝鲁特爆发激烈炮战
    新华社北京12月5日电  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特今天再度爆发激烈炮战。居民们极度恐慌，担心黎巴嫩对立双方军事摊牌，爆发全面性战争。
    这场持续2个多小时的炮战是在忠于奥恩将军的基督教军队与叙利亚支持的穆斯林民兵之间进行的。双方动用了包括反坦克火箭在内的各种轻重武器。
    据贝鲁特保安人士说，奥恩的军队得到全国最大民兵组织基督教“黎巴嫩力量”的支持。
    但是，已经部署在东贝鲁特巴卜达总统府附近的叙利亚军队没有介入这场炮战。
    贝鲁特炮声隆隆，使贝鲁特市民陷于极度恐慌。路上行人四散奔逃，交通一片混乱。商店纷纷关闭。
    这是自9月23日冲突双方结束长达半年的炮战以来出现的最激烈的一次炮战。伤亡情况还不清楚。
    黎巴嫩新总统赫拉维11月24日当选后不久，威胁要用武力将奥恩赶出巴卜达总统府。叙利亚同时向贝鲁特增兵。忠于奥恩的2万军队也处于战斗状态。双方军事力量紧张对峙，剑拔弩张。这场炮战就是在这种形势下爆发的。
    与此同时，已被赫拉维总统解职的奥恩将军今天在接受英国一家电台采访时，再次表示，不惜战死，也不交出巴卜达，坚持不承认赫拉维新政府的立场。
