Jiangsu Launches Emergency Transport of Stored Coal; Congestion at Pukou Port Station Eased

	People's Daily, Nanjing, December 2 (Xinhua News Agency reporter Fei Qiang, People's Daily reporter Gong Yongquan) On November 21, this newspaper published a letter titled "Severe Backlog of Electric Coal, Pukou Port Station in Crisis." Ten days later, reporters visited Pukou Port and Station and found that the long lines of coal trains had been shortened, and the stockpiled coal had decreased from a peak of 144,000 tons to 74,000 tons, significantly easing the situation.

	The backlog of electric coal at Pukou Port and Station began in September. Although the supply and demand situation for coal had eased and the coal supply had improved, the coal owners did not promptly arrange for transportation, resulting in a peak stockpile of 144,000 tons, exceeding the storage capacity by more than 20,000 tons. At its worst, 16 coal-loaded trains were delayed. Although relevant departments had taken some measures, they had not fundamentally reversed the situation. By November 22, the port's coal stockpile had again exceeded 120,000 tons.

	On November 23 and 24, the Jiangsu Provincial Production Dispatch Office, in conjunction with relevant departments, decided: from November 25 to December 10, to organize two 5,000-ton barges and one 3,000-ton barge, along with a pushboat fleet, to urgently transport 52,000 tons of stored coal from Pukou to the Xunpu Power Plant. Given that the Pukou yard had 44,000 tons of unplanned coal, occupying the planned coal storage area, in addition to expediting transportation, it was decided that Pukou Port and Station would temporarily stop receiving and transferring cooperative coal. If any cooperative coal arrives at the station, it will be handled by the Nanjing Railway Bureau or the Nanjing Port Authority. Thus, the severe backlog of electric coal at Pukou Port and Station has been temporarily resolved.

	Kong Linguo, Director of the Pukou Railway Port Joint Transportation Office, told reporters that although the coal backlog has been eased, the outlook is not optimistic. He hopes that the provincial and municipal governments will convene relevant departments for discussions to quickly formulate regulations for clearing the station and port, ensuring the smooth operation of the station and port.

    江苏突击疏运存煤  浦口港站积压缓解
    本报南京12月2日电　新华社记者费强、本报记者龚永泉报道：11月21日，本报发表了“电煤严重积压，浦口港站告急”的来信。10天之后，记者来到浦口港、站采访，看到绵延的“煤龙”已被斩成了数节，存煤已由最多时的14.4万吨降到7.4万吨，得到了明显的缓解。
    浦口港、站电煤积压是从9月份开始的，由于煤炭供求关系缓和，到煤状况转好，但电煤货主却不及时调运，致使最多时的存煤达14.4万吨，超过堆存能力2万多吨。严重时煤炭重车滞留16列。有关部门虽也采取了一些措施，但未能从根本上扭转，11月22日，港存煤再度超过12万吨。
    11月23日和24日，江苏省生产调度办公室会同有关部门商定：从11月25日至12月10日，组织5000吨级驳船两艘、3000吨级驳船一艘，同推轮编队，从浦口突击疏运5.2万吨存煤到谏壁电厂；鉴于浦口场存计划外煤炭高达4.4万吨，挤占了统配煤场地，除抓紧疏运外，决定11月、12月浦口港、站暂停接转协作煤炭，如再有协作煤到站，一律由南京铁路分局或由南京港务局转运。至此，浦口港、站电煤严重积压告一段落。
    浦口铁路港务联合运输办公室主任孔令国对记者说，这次电煤积压虽已缓解，但前景不容乐观，希望省、市政府召集各有关部门进行会商，尽快制定疏站、疏港的法规，从根本上确保车站港口的畅通。
