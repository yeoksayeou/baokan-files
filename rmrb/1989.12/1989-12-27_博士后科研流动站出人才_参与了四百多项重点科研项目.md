The postdoctoral system in China, established less than five years ago, has already produced a batch of high-level scientific and technological talents for the country. According to a survey by the Expert Department of the Ministry of Personnel on 261 postdoctoral researchers who entered the postdoctoral research stations earlier, these individuals are currently undertaking and participating in 414 national or provincial-level key scientific and technological projects. Nineteen of them have received national or provincial-level science and technology awards.

Currently, the state has established 159 postdoctoral research stations in 93 scientific research institutions and universities across the country. A total of 552 young scientific and technological personnel who have obtained doctoral degrees both domestically and abroad have entered these postdoctoral research stations, with 93 of them having completed their postdoctoral research tasks and left the stations.
