On the eve of Japan's "Respect for the Aged Day" on September 11, an elderly couple in Kotsucho Town, Akita Prefecture, were found dead in their home. A suicide note left by the wife was discovered. The male victim, Yoshiki Nomura, 71, was found lying peacefully in his bed with a rope around his neck. His wife was found hanging from a beam in an adjacent room.

Three years prior, Nomura had suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed and bedridden, entirely dependent on his wife for care. This year, in August, his wife discovered a polyp in her stomach and was scheduled to be hospitalized for treatment on September 11. To ensure her husband's daily needs were met during her hospital stay, she arranged for her younger brother to care for him. However, when her brother arrived to take Nomura home, he found the couple's lifeless bodies.

According to local police, the Nomura couple had three children but had been living separately from them for about fifteen years. The couple was known for their deep affection for each other, and neighbors described them as an inseparable pair. However, due to her despair over their future, the wife strangled her husband and then took her own life.

There are many elderly people in Japan facing similar fates. According to the National Police Agency, while the overall number of suicides in Japan has been decreasing in recent years, the number of suicides among those aged 65 and above has been increasing. Last year, there were 6,312 suicides among the elderly, a 2.7% increase from the previous year, accounting for 26.6% of the total suicides, reaching a peak. The majority of these elderly suicides were due to prolonged suffering from illnesses. Others were due to mental health issues stemming from alcoholism, and some were due to economic hardships.

The agency's analysis suggests that the increase in elderly suicides highlights certain issues within Japanese society.

    日本老人晚景堪忧  自杀人数逐年增多
    在日本“敬老日”前一天的9月11日，日本秋田县琴丘町有一对老年夫妇双双死于家中，住宅里发现了妻子留下的遗书。男性死者叫野村吉市，今年71岁，被发现时安卧在被褥中，颈上缠绕着绳索；他妻子则吊死在邻室的房梁上。
    三年前野村由于脑中风引起半身瘫痪，经常卧床不起，全靠妻子照料。今年8月份，妻子也发现胃部长有息肉，原定于9月11日住院治疗。为照顾丈夫的日常生活，她请了她的弟弟在她住院期间代为照料自己的丈夫，谁知她弟弟按约前来接野村回家去时，却发现了他们的尸体。
    据当地警署调查，野村夫妇有三个孩子，约在十五年前他俩已和孩子们分居，两人相依为命十分恩爱，邻居们称他俩是一对形影不离的好夫妻。但由于妻子对他们的前途极度悲观，因此勒死了自己的丈夫，然后自杀。
    像野村夫妇这样命运的老人在日本是很多的。据警察厅的调查，近几年来日本自杀人数渐趋减少，但65岁以上高龄自杀者却有增加。去年一年里高龄自杀者为6312人，比前年增加2．7％，占自杀总人数的26.6％，达到了高峰。分析一下这些高龄自杀者的动机，绝大多数是由于长期病魔缠身，痛苦不堪。其次是由于酒精中毒引起的精神性疾患。也有因经济原因的。
    该厅分析，高龄老人自杀者的增多，暴露了日本社会存在某种弊端。                    （裴君 编译）
