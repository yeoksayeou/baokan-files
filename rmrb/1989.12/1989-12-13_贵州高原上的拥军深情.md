The deep bonds between military and civilian personnel on the Guizhou Plateau are truly unforgettable.

We cannot let our soldiers go hungry

On May 1st, 1984, the Guizhou Provincial Government held a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government to discuss and approve a report from the Guizhou Provincial Military Region requesting the allocation of a piece of land for mining aluminum and developing military production. The meeting was chaired by Governor Wang Chaowen, who emotionally stated: During the war years, our soldiers were at the forefront of overthrowing the "three mountains." After the founding of the nation, they have defended the borders and shed much blood and sweat! We in Guizhou may be poor, but we cannot allow our national defense forces to be weakened on this land. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Government decided: Within the scope of national policies, we will allow and support the military to engage in mining and other production and business activities.

Subsequently, other units also applied to mine in Guizhou, and the provincial government gave the green light, allocating large tracts of land to these units for mining phosphate, manganese, mercury, and bauxite. For units with the conditions, they also agreed to build smelting plants.

However, due to the military's lagging production technology, funds, transportation, and other conditions, the economic benefits of mining were not high. Provincial leaders learned of this and, within a few days, did three things for the units mining in Guizhou: They instructed the Metallurgical Bureau and other departments to send technical personnel to the mining sites for guidance; they approved loans of over 20 million yuan for the military to purchase equipment; and they approved the allocation of over 30 vehicles for the military. Various local governments and departments also listed supporting the military in improving production and operations as a priority. All counties in the province allocated over 11 million yuan from their limited fiscal budgets to support the construction of military camps in Guizhou, and spent over 9 million yuan to improve training facilities.

We cannot let our military families suffer

In the spring of 1985, the Provincial Party Committee received several letters reflecting that the preferential treatment work was not being implemented, and the lives of military families were too hard! These letters pierced the hearts of the responsible comrades in the Provincial Party Committee.

Guizhou's fiscal revenue is limited, and yet Guizhou sends a large number of soldiers each year. Relying solely on the national treasury is not enough to solve the problem of preferential treatment, so since 1984, the entire province has begun to collect preferential treatment funds from farmers at the township level. However, the wealth of townships varies, and the number of soldiers sent out is not the same, so the preferential treatment funds for military families in various places are also quite different. Moreover, some farmers have grievances: The more soldiers sent out, the more the burden; the fewer soldiers sent out, the less the burden. The nation needs everyone to defend it, but why are those who receive salaries not subject to the collection of preferential treatment funds?

Where can we find a new method? The Provincial Civil Affairs Department provided a piece of information: Shiqian County implemented a system of collecting preferential treatment funds from citizens at the county level, which relatively well solved various problems that arose from collecting preferential treatment funds at the township level. Governor Wang Chaowen listened carefully to the report from Shiqian County and believed this to be a new approach to implementing preferential treatment policies. The province issued a document, establishing the system of collecting preferential treatment funds from citizens at the county level as a new policy for implementing preferential treatment policies in the new era. By the end of 1988, all 61 counties (cities) in the province had implemented the method of collecting preferential treatment funds at the county level. Immediately afterward, each county and city enacted this policy into law, making it a legal and institutionalized practice. At the end of last year, the Guizhou Provincial Civil Affairs Department introduced this experience at the national civil affairs work conference and it was circulated nationwide.

The implementation of the collection of preferential treatment funds has led to the implementation of preferential treatment policies for military families throughout the province. In the province, 30 counties have implemented insurance for the property of military families, and 6 counties have fully developed and placed 100% of demobilized soldiers from rural areas. The provincial civil affairs departments have supported 64,796 impoverished military families to escape poverty from the aspects of science and technology and funds. Each county has established service teams for military families to farm, harvest, collect firewood, deliver coal, and repair houses, totaling over 13,000 teams, which have been active in the mountainous areas of the province for many years.

The deep affection of the hometown has produced a tremendous spiritual driving force among Guizhou soldiers. In the spring of 1988, 40 officers and soldiers from the Red Army Regiment of a certain border defense unit in Yunnan jointly presented a plaque to their hometown, Xifeng County, with the words "We are at ease with home affairs, and the border affairs are at ease with the hometown." More than 100 Guizhou soldiers from a certain border defense unit in Yunnan were all admitted to the party and received awards and commendations when they demobilized last year; 97 Guizhou soldiers from a certain border defense unit in Guangxi were all awarded the title of "Excellent Soldier of Faka Mountain" by the Guangxi Military Region last year. In the recruitment of soldiers, the enrollment rate of eligible young people in most counties (cities) has reached 100% year after year.

We cannot let our demobilized officers suffer a loss

According to a survey by relevant departments on 200 demobilized officers who have worked in Guizhou in recent years, the results show that 96% are satisfied or relatively satisfied with their placement.

Guizhou's leaders at all levels, as well as comrades from the personnel and demobilized officers departments, have a common idea: Demobilized officers have dedicated the most precious years of their lives to national defense, and in many ways, they have made extraordinary sacrifices. When they are demobilized to local areas, we cannot let them suffer a loss. Guizhou Provincial Party Secretary Liu Zhengwei has repeatedly emphasized: "We must do everything possible to place demobilized officers well, create relatively good living and working conditions for them, and this is an important task that can both strengthen our Great Wall and stabilize our troops, as well as effectively develop talent."

The leaders of Guizhou Province also considered that in recent years, many military officers have married urban girls, and those whose spouses are rural households but meet the conditions for accompanying the military have all moved into the city. Based on the actual situation of the province, they made a regulation: "Demobilized officers can be placed in the location where their spouse works." This allows the majority of demobilized officers, especially those who enlisted from rural areas, to be placed in the location where their spouse works.

In 1987, 4 military officers who were demobilized to a certain unit in the Zunyi region were supposed to be placed in Zunyi City according to the regulations, but were instead assigned to a county town. The provincial government leaders called the leaders of this unit twice to urge them to quickly place them in Zunyi City.

Guizhou Province was also the first in the country to implement a policy of combining the placement of demobilized military officers with their performance in the military, and formulated specific preferential policies for 6 categories of demobilized officers who have participated in battles, won awards, been injured, long-term guarded border islands, long-term engaged in aviation and submarine work, and have long military service and high rank. These preferential policies were implemented in a certain unit on the border front line executing combat missions, and Guizhou officers and soldiers were greatly encouraged. That year, 6 out of the 10 officers and soldiers awarded the title of hero by the military headquarters were from Guizhou. This year, a battalion-level officer who was demobilized with a first-class merit was placed in the Provincial Transportation School, and his wife and children also moved from the county town to be with him. The school, in a situation of housing difficulties, adjusted a set of newly built houses for other purposes, allowing this officer to move into a new house as soon as he reported for duty.

Guizhou Province is even more concerned about the placement of injured military officers. In 1983, the Provincial Military Demobilization Office received a batch of injured officers who had participated in battles from a certain group army, and all of them were arranged in units with good conditions. Many injured officers shed tears of gratitude when they took up their new positions.

The responsible spirit of Guizhou Province in placing demobilized officers has made demobilized officers feel the warmth of the Party, and thus they have shown great enthusiasm for work. According to the annual tracking survey by the Provincial Military Demobilization Office, since 1983, more than 50% of the military officers demobilized and placed in various parts of Guizhou have been evaluated as county-level labor models, advanced workers, received various honorary titles, been awarded merits, and promoted to first or second-level positions.

The deep affection for the military on the land of Guizhou gives great encouragement to the soldiers fighting on the frontier. Every year, Guizhou Province receives sincere letters from the soldiers, expressing: Facing the deep love of the people of Guizhou, we will contribute more to national defense construction.

    贵州高原上的拥军深情
    邓高如　岑应奎
    在贵州高原，军政、军民鱼水深情实在令人难忘。
    穷，不能穷了子弟兵
    1984年5月的一天，贵州省人民政府召开省长常务会议，讨论批复贵州省军区关于请求划拨一片土地开采铝矿，发展部队生产的报告。主持会议的王朝文省长动情地说：战争年代，子弟兵推翻“三座大山”一马当先；建国以后，他们御敌守边，流了多少血汗！我们贵州再穷，也不能让国防力量在贵州这块土地上受到削弱。省长常务会议决定：在国家政策规定的范围内，允许而且支持部队开矿和从事其他生产经营。
    之后，其它部队相继申请在黔开矿，省政府都开了“绿灯”，给这些部队划大片土地，专供他们开采磷、锰、汞、铝矾土等矿；对有条件的部队，还同意他们建冶炼厂。
    但是，由于部队生产技术、资金、运输工具等条件跟不上，开矿的经济效益并不高。省领导同志得知后，没几天，就为在黔开矿的部队做了3件事：指示冶金厅等部门派技术人员到开矿现场进行指导；给部队先后批贷2000多万元，供他们添置设备；批准拨给部队运输车辆30多台。各地各部门也都把支持部队搞好生产经营列入议事日程。全省各县还从有限的财政开支中拨款1100多万元，支援驻黔部队修建营区，拿出900多万元完善训练设施。
        苦，不能苦了军烈属
    1985年春，省委收到一些信件，反映优待工作不落实，军烈属的日子过得太苦！这些信件刺痛着省委负责同志的心。
    贵州省财政收入有限，而贵州每年输送的兵员又多，仅靠国家财政还不能完全解决优待问题，于是从1984年起，全省就开始以乡为单位，从农民手里提取优待金。但是，乡与乡之间贫富不等，出兵多少不一，各地军烈属的优待金也就差别很大。而且有的农民有情绪：出兵多负担多，出兵少负担少，国家需要大家保卫，而领工资的为什么不被提取优待金？
    新的办法哪里找？省民政厅提供了一个信息：石阡县以县为单位从公民中统筹提取优待金，实行了一年，较好地解决了以乡为单位提取优待金中出现的各种弊病。省长王朝文详细听取了石阡县的汇报，认为这是落实优待的新途径。省里下发文件，把以县为单位从公民中统筹提取优待金的办法，确定为新时期落实优待政策的一项制度。至1988年底，全省61个县（市）先后实行了以县统筹提取优待金的做法。紧接着，各县市将这一政策立了法，使之走上了法制化、制度化的轨道。去年年底，贵州省民政厅在全国民政工作会议上介绍了经验，并被转发全国。
    优待金提取的落实，全省对军人家属的优待政策也随之落实。全省有30个县对军烈属的财产实行了保险，6个县100％地开发安置了农村籍退伍战士。全省民政部门从科技、资金等方面扶持64796户贫困军烈属脱了贫。各县先后建立为军烈属种地、收割、打柴、送煤、修房等服务小组1.3万多个，长年活动在全省山区。
    故乡的深情在贵州籍军人中产生巨大的精神动力。1988年春节，驻云南边防某部红军团的40名官兵联名给家乡——息烽县县委、县人民政府赠送锦旗，上书“家里事我们放心，边疆事乡亲放心”14个大字；云南边防某部100多名贵州籍战士到去年退伍时，人人入党，个个立功受奖；广西边防某部97名贵州籍战士，去年全部被广西军区授予“法卡山优秀战士”称号。在兵员征集中，大多数县（市）适龄应征青年报名率连年达100％。
          亏，不能亏了转业干部
    据有关部门对近年来转业到贵州省工作的200名干部进行调查，结果是：对安置满意和比较满意的占96％。
    贵州的各级党政领导、人事和军转部门的同志有这样一种共同的想法：转业干部已经把人生最宝贵的青春年华奉献给了国防事业，在许多方面已经作出了超乎寻常的牺牲。转业下地方，不能再让他们吃亏。贵州省委书记刘正威多次强调：“千方百计把转业干部安置好，为他们创造比较良好的生活、工作条件，是一项既能固我长城、稳我军心、又有效地开发人才的重要工作。”
    贵州省的领导同志还想到，这些年来，许多军队干部已与城镇姑娘结了婚，配偶是农村户口够随军条件的也都随军进了城。他们根据本省实际作出规定：“转业干部可到配偶工作所在地安置。”这就使得广大转业干部特别是农村入伍的干部能够安置在配偶的工作地。
    1987年转业到遵义地区某单位的4名军队干部，按规定应该安置在遵义市工作，却被分配到了县城。省政府领导曾两次打电话催促这个单位的领导尽快将他们安置到遵义市。
    贵州省还在全国最早实行了安置军队转业干部与军队干部在部队的表现结合起来的政策，制定了有利于参过战、立过功、负过伤，长期守护边防海岛、长期从事飞行潜艇工作、军龄长职务高等6类转业干部的具体照顾政策。这些照顾政策传到边防前线执行战斗任务的某部，贵州籍干部战士受到极大鼓舞。这一年，参战部队被我军总部授予英雄称号的10人中，贵州籍干部战士就占6人。今年一位荣立一等功的连职转业干部被安置到省交通学校，其爱人孩子也从县城随迁到身边。学校在住房困难情况下，从新建的作别的用途的房屋中调出一套住房，使这名干部一报到就住进了新房。
    对军队伤残干部的安置，贵州省更是关心备至。1983年，省军转办接收了一批来自某集团军的参战伤残干部，全部安排到条件好的单位。不少伤残干部在走上新岗位时都感激得流了泪。
    贵州省安置转业干部的负责精神，使转业干部感受到党的温暖，因而表现出了极大的工作热情。据省军转办连年的跟踪调查表明，自1983年以来，转业到贵州各地安置的军队干部中，被评为县以上劳模、先进工作者，获得各种荣誉称号、立功受奖、被提拔一、二级职务的，共占转业安置干部总数的50％以上。
    贵州大地上的拥军深情，给战斗在边陲的将士们以极大的鼓舞。每年，贵州省都收到将士们情真意笃的来信，将士们表示：面对贵州人民的深情厚爱，我们要为国防建设多作贡献。
