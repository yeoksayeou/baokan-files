The reporter learned from the just-concluded third annual meeting of the China Machinery Management Association that the fixed assets of equipment in state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises in China account for more than 60% of the total fixed assets. Managing, utilizing, and upgrading existing equipment is a crucial guarantee for the sustained and stable development of China's economy.

The meeting pointed out that the main problem at present is the neglect of equipment maintenance and management in production, and even the practice of "packaging" instead of managing. Major equipment accidents occur from time to time. This should be given high attention, and efforts should be made to promote modern equipment management. It is understood that in the past three years, the Machinery Management Association, in cooperation with relevant departments, has achieved economic benefits of over 200 million yuan by using new technologies to repair parts of imported equipment; the value of idle equipment adjusted is 300 million yuan.

    中国设备管理协会提出
    管好用好改造好现有设备
    本报北京12月10日讯　记者从刚刚结束的中国设备管理协会第三次年会上获悉，我国全民所有制工交企业的设备固定资产占全部固定资产的60％以上。管好、用好、改造好现有设备，是我国经济持续稳定发展的重要保证。
    会议认为，当前面临的主要问题是生产中忽视设备维修管理，甚至以包代管，设备重大事故时有发生。对此应引起高度重视，要大力推进设备现代化管理。据了解，近3年来，设备管理协会配合有关部门，通过用新技术修复进口设备的零件，取得经济效益2亿多元；调剂的闲置设备价值3亿元。
