Title: Reply to an Anonymous Reader

Recently, I received a letter from someone who signed as "an ordinary student studying in the United States." The letter criticized the overseas edition of our newspaper. He read our newspaper (overseas edition) and offered his opinions, which is good and should be appreciated.

However, some of his opinions, we cannot agree with.

Firstly, he said that our newspaper (overseas edition) has deviated from the principle of seeking truth from facts. He cited an example from an article titled "Who is Wu'erkaixi" published in the fourth issue of this year's December 2nd edition of the _Outlook_ weekly, specifically the issue of Wu'erkaixi's prostitution. The original text is as follows: "Xiao Qiang (note: Wu'erkaixi's classmate) also said that Wu'erkaixi shamelessly engaged in prostitution and even publicly boasted about it. Once, he returned to the dormitory and gleefully told us: 'I am the happiest person in the world. Last night, the pimp treated me, and I enjoyed the prostitute for free.'" This incident has a witness, and this anonymous reader cannot provide any counter-evidence. However, he said: "Recently, an article exposing Wu'erkaixi mentioned that this person had engaged in prostitution during his university years, which surprised me. I have lived in Beijing for over 20 years and have never heard of any brothels or prostitutes in Beijing. Just this point alone makes one doubt the entire article's authenticity." This conclusion is rather hasty. Just because you haven't heard of it or don't know about it, does it mean it doesn't exist? It is a fact that Beijing had no brothels or prostitutes after the liberation. But opening up to the outside world also brought some negative elements, and prostitution resurfaced. What do you do when flies come in? You swat them. Recently, Beijing and the entire country have launched a campaign to "eliminate six evils," with the first evil being the crackdown on prostitution and solicitation. This matter has been reported by our newspaper (overseas edition), and this reader might not have seen it.

Secondly, the reader said that the language of _People's Daily_ is shallow and illogical. For example: "There is a commentary titled 'Tighten Our Belts for a Few Days,' which discusses China's national conditions, saying our national conditions are 'we need to eat enough, but we cannot eat too much.' Such a metaphor to describe our national conditions is indeed colloquial, but is it too shallow?" Indeed, if it were said this way, it would not only be shallow but also illogical. Eating more after eating enough would surely cause stomach problems. The problem is that our newspaper did not say this. The original text is: "Our national conditions are such that we need to eat enough, but we cannot eat too well." We believe there is nothing wrong with this. Currently, China can only say that the problem of basic food and clothing has been basically solved, and it has not yet reached the level of "food should not be too refined" as Confucius said. To say that "cannot eat too well" is "eat too much" is a deliberate distortion, lacking evidence; to say it is careless, it would not be wrong. There is also a side evidence: the title of the editorial published by our newspaper on November 29th is "On Tightening Our Belts," and this reader even got the title of this editorial wrong.

Still, we welcome readers giving us feedback. If the feedback is incorrect, we do not blame them. "The speaker is without guilt, the listener takes heed" after all. Moreover, our newspaper has many aspects that need improvement in content and language, and this kind of criticism is an encouragement and a whip to the editors. However, since we are talking about seeking truth from facts, as an editor, I still have to speak the truth.

I hope that the anonymous reader can see these words and read them carefully.

    答一位不知名的读者
    甘为
    最近辗转收到署名“一个普通的留美学生”的一封信，是对本报（海外版）提出批评意见的。他读了本报（海外版），提出了意见，这是好的，应该感谢。
    不过，有些意见，我们不能赞同。
    首先，他说本报（海外版）背离了实事求是的思想路线。举的例子是本报（海外版）今年12月2日四版转载的《瞭望》周刊文章《吾尔开希其人》一文的一件事，即吾尔开希嫖娼问题。原文是这样的：“萧强（注：吾尔开希的同学）还说，吾尔开希还不知廉耻地嫖娼，而且当众加以宣扬。有一次他回宿舍，美滋滋地对我们说：‘我是世界上最幸福的人，昨天晚上“拉皮条”的请我客，免费让我玩了婊子。’”此事有人为证，这位不知名的读者也提不出反证。但是他却说：“前些日子一揭露吾尔开希的文章，提到此人上大学期间有嫖娼行为，我很吃惊，我在北京生活20余年，从未听说北京有妓院或娼妓。只此一条，便使人对整篇文章的真实性生疑。”这个结论，未免过于武断。你未听说或你不知道的事就不存在吗？北京没有妓院，是事实，在解放初期，妓院以及娼妓都已取缔了。但对外开放，也带来一些消极的东西，卖淫现象又死灰复燃。进来了苍蝇怎么办？打就是了。最近北京及全国开展的“除六害”，头一害就是打击卖淫嫖娼。此事本报（海外版）报道过，这位读者可能未看。
    其二，这位读者说，《人民日报》文字浅俗，逻辑混乱。举例说：“有一篇评论叫《过几天紧日子》，谈到中国的国情，说我们的国情‘是既要吃饱，又不能吃得太饱’，这样的比喻来形容我们的国情，通俗是通俗，但是否太浅薄了些？”是啊，假如真是这样说的，何止是浅薄，而且不合逻辑，吃饱了再吃，岂不撑出胃病来？问题在于，本报不是这样说的，原文是：“我们的国情就是这样，既要吃饱，又不能吃得太好。”我们认为，这没有什么错，中国目前只能说基本上解决了温饱问题，还没有达到孔老夫子所说的“食不厌精”的地步。把“不能吃得太好”，说成“吃得太饱”，说是有意歪曲，缺乏证据；要说粗枝大叶，想必不会冤枉的。这里还有一个旁证：本报11月29日发表的社论的题目是《谈过紧日子》，这位读者连这篇社论的标题都搞错了。
    话还得说回来，读者给本报提意见，我们是欢迎的。提得不对，我们也不怪罪，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”嘛。何况，本报在内容上、文字上确有许多亟待改进之处，这类批评，对编者是激励和鞭策。不过，既然讲实事求是，笔者作为编者之一，还得实话实说。
    但愿那位不知名的读者能够看到这些话，并且看得仔细些。
