The reporter visited the Gansu Aluminum Company and saw the company's Party Secretary Yu Dejun's recent weekly schedule for after-work activities:

On Monday, after dinner, he visited three retired workers.
On Tuesday, after dinner, he went to the workers' dormitories to check the heating supply.
On Wednesday, at 7:30 PM, he participated in workers' recreational activities at the club.
On Thursday, at 6:30 PM, he participated in the labor to transport alumina.
On Friday, at 8:00 PM, he participated in the workers' basketball league.
On Saturday, at 8:30 PM, he visited a worker's family where an accident had occurred.
On Sunday, at 9:00 AM, he participated in a collective wedding for workers, at 3:00 PM, he participated in the labor to transport alumina, and at 7:30 PM, he played chess with several old workers...

For the past three years, Yu Dejun has arranged his after-work time in this manner.

Under his influence, several dozen grassroots Party organizations in the company and hundreds of Party members have also worked diligently to do good deeds for the people. Issues that workers had previously strongly complained about, such as difficulties in commuting, housing, and children's education, have now been relatively satisfactorily resolved. The number of workers applying to join the Party has been increasing. "Go to the organization," has become a common saying among the workers.

    党委书记遇德君下班后忙什么？请看——
    一张业余时间表
    新华社兰州12月1日电  （记者赵传明）记者来到甘肃省铝业公司采访，看到公司党委书记遇德君最近一周的业余时间活动表：
    星期一，晚饭后看望三位退休老工人；
    星期二，晚饭后到职工宿舍检查暖气供应情况；
    星期三，晚7时半到俱乐部参加职工游艺活动；
    星期四，晚6时半参加抢运氧化铝劳动；
    星期五，晚8时参加职工篮球联赛；
    星期六，晚8时半到一家中发生意外事故的职工家探望；
    星期日，上午9时参加职工集体婚礼，下午3时参加抢运氧化铝劳动，晚7时半同几位老工人下棋……
    三年来，遇德君就是这样安排自己的业余时间的。
    在他的带动下，公司几十个基层党组织、数百名党员也都扎扎实实地为群众办好事。过去职工反映强烈的通勤难、住房难、子女上学难等问题，现在得到了比较圆满解决。公司要求入党的职工日渐增多。“找组织去”，已成为广大职工的口头禅。
