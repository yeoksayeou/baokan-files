The "Vegetable Basket Project" in China, after one year of formal implementation, has shown initial success. Overall, the production of subsidiary food items has maintained a good development trend. Effective supply has increased, sales prices have stabilized, and market supply has significantly improved compared to last year.

According to authoritative figures from the Ministry of Agriculture, the total meat production this year is expected to reach 25 million tons, an increase of 2 million tons compared to last year. The total egg production is expected to reach 7.04 million tons, an increase of 0.9 million tons compared to last year. The total milk production is expected to reach 4.58 million tons, an increase of 0.39 million tons compared to last year.

This year, China's aquatic product production continued to grow, with an expected output of 11.2 million tons, an increase of 0.6 million tons compared to last year. There is a possibility of becoming the second-largest aquatic product producer in the world.

This year, the total vegetable production nationwide has increased, with a higher proportion of fine vegetables and overall better quality compared to last year. Currently, even though it is winter in Beijing, both state-run markets and free markets are filled with various fresh vegetables, and the prices are among the lowest in recent years.

It is reported that Jilin Province, which has historically relied on importing pork from other provinces, has achieved self-sufficiency in pork for the first time this year. This is due to the implementation of the "Vegetable Basket Project," which organized and promoted a number of effective and applicable technologies.

Deputy Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang revealed that after the implementation of various measures of the "Vegetable Basket Project," both the central government and local authorities have increased their financial input for the production and construction of subsidiary food items. This year, in addition to continuing to allocate more than 1 billion yuan in production loans for subsidiary food items and maintaining the original investment channels, the state has also added a new special loan of 200 million yuan.

    “菜篮子工程”一年初见成效
    副食品生产保持较好发展势头
    新华社北京12月27日电　（记者严文斌）我国“菜篮子工程”经过一年的正式实施，现已初见成效。整个副食品生产保持较好的发展势头，有效供给增加，销售价格稳定，市场供应明显好于去年。
    据农业部权威人士估计，今年肉类总产量可达2500万吨，比去年增加20万吨；禽蛋总产量可达704万吨，比去年增加9万吨；奶类总产量可达458万吨，比去年增加39万吨。
    今年，我国水产品产量继续增长，预计可达1120万吨，比去年增加60万吨，有希望成为世界上第二水产品生产大国。
    今年，全国蔬菜上市量增加，细菜比重上升，质量普遍好于去年。目前北京虽已是寒冬，但不管是国营菜场还是集贸市场里仍摆满各种鲜嫩蔬菜，价格也是近年来较低的一年。
    据悉，历史上一直靠从外省调进猪肉的吉林省，由于按照“菜篮子工程”的规划，组织推广了一批增产效果显著的适用技术，今年首次实现了猪肉自给。
    农业部副部长刘江透露，“菜篮子工程”的各项措施出台以后，中央和地方都增加了对副食品生产和建设的资金投入。今年国家除了继续安排10多亿元副食品生产贷款，保留原有的投资渠道外，还新增加了2000万元的专项贷款。
