In late November, at the invitation of the Iranian Political and International Studies Institute, the reporter attended the Gulf Conference held in Tehran. Flying west from Beijing at night, under the bright moonlight, looking down at the earth, one could sometimes see vast grasslands and endless deserts, and sometimes see towering mountains covered with snow. Iran has been a friendly neighbor of China since ancient times. The famous "Silk Road" connects the two countries. In ancient times, envoys from the two countries had to travel long distances along the "Silk Road," enduring wind and snow, and spend years before they could reach the other country. Now, we only need eight hours to reach the Iranian capital, Tehran.

Tehran can be said to be the new capital of an ancient country. As early as 2,500 years ago, Iran created a brilliant ancient civilization. However, Tehran became the capital of Iran only in the 18th century. In the 9th century, it was still a village. In 1788, the Qajar Dynasty of Iran chose Tehran as the national capital. It is only about 100 kilometers away from the Caspian Sea, with the Elburz Mountains towering to the north. From this central location, it can control the various valleys leading to the Caspian Sea and also reach the oases in central Iran. The entire city is built on a slope, with the north higher than the south. The Persian word "Tehran" means "warm place." We were warmly welcomed by Iranian friends at the airport. The hotel we stayed at, "Independence," is located in the northern highlands of the city, with the entire landscape of Tehran at our feet. According to our Iranian friends, Tehran is developing rapidly. Originally, it was established according to the Paris model, with the city developing from south to north. Now, two wide and straight tree-lined avenues run through the south-north and east-west of the city. The southern part of the city has more ancient buildings, with red-brick houses and some maze-like winding alleys. Many markets here still retain the ancient Persian style. The northern part of the city has more modern buildings, with many shops selling imported goods, and some high-end hotels. The center of the streets has flower beds and fountains, forming street parks. The streets are lined with shops, and the crowds are bustling. Women's clothing is mostly black, from black headscarves, black cloaks to black shoes, while men's clothing is more varied, from various colored suits to Muslim attire. The city has a permanent population of over seven million, and with the floating population, it reaches one million, making it Iran's largest city. During rush hours, the streets are filled with traffic.

Tehran has many historical monuments and museums. As soon as you leave Tehran International Airport, you can see the majestic and stylish Azadi Tower, which is 45 meters high and grayish-white. It was built in October 1971 to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire. Along the tree-lined avenue to the northern foothills, you can find the Pahlavi Palace. The palace courtyard has a maple forest, and the palace is a two-story granite modern building, with separate rooms for the Pahlavi King's reception hall, dining room, living quarters, etc., which are quite luxurious. After the Iranian revolution overthrew the monarchy, the Pahlavi Palace was opened to the public and turned into the "People's Palace Museum." On the side of Laleh Park in the city center is the Iran Carpet Museum, which has a unique architectural style and resembles a loom. It houses more than 5,000 precious samples of carpets from various parts of Iran from the 16th to the 20th century. Visitors come in an endless stream. In addition, there are art and culture museums, all reflecting the brilliant Persian culture of thousands of years.

The eight-year Iran-Iraq War naturally left its mark on Tehran. The streets are in disrepair, and new residential buildings are far from meeting the needs. Daily necessities are in short supply, with rice, meat, eggs, etc., partly rationed and partly available in free markets, but at high prices. Walking on the streets, one can often see people disabled by the war. People hope that the war will not happen again.

In the suburbs of Tehran, people are busy repairing roads, renovating factories, and building new schools and residential areas. The Iranian government and people regard healing the wounds of war and developing the economy as urgent tasks. In July, the newly elected President Rafsanjani pointed out after taking office: "Without economic independence, there can be no political independence." The government's five-year economic plan focuses on rebuilding areas damaged by the war, restoring and developing the oil industry, basic industries, and basic consumer goods projects to meet domestic urgent needs, curb price increases, and improve people's living standards. The practical measures taken by the Iranian government to develop the economy are welcomed by the masses.

    初冬访伊朗
    本报记者  李红
    十一月下旬，应伊朗政治国际研究所的邀请，记者出席了在德黑兰举行的波斯湾国际会议。从北京乘飞机向西夜航，透过皎洁的月光，俯视大地，时而看到漫漫草原和无垠的沙漠，时而又看到皑皑冰雪覆盖着的崇山峻岭。伊朗自古就是中国的友好邻邦。世界著名的“丝绸之路”把两国联结在一起。古时候两国人民的使者需要在“丝绸之路”上长途跋涉，历经风雪，终年累月才能到达对方的国家，可如今我们只用八个小时就到达了伊朗首都德黑兰。
    德黑兰可以说是个古老国家的新首都。早在两千五百年前，伊朗就创建了灿烂的古代文明。然而德黑兰作为伊朗的首都则是从十八世纪开始的。它在九世纪时还是一个乡村，一七八八年伊朗恺加王朝选择德黑兰为国家的首都。它离里海只一百多公里，厄尔布尔士山耸立其北，从这个中心位置可以控制通往里海的各个山谷，也可通往伊朗中部各绿洲。整个城市建立在一个山坡上，北高南低，波斯语“德黑兰”意为“暖地”。我们在机场受到伊朗朋友的热烈欢迎。下榻的“独立”旅馆正好位于城北的高地，整个德黑兰市的风光尽收眼底。据伊朗朋友说，德黑兰市发展很快。原来是按巴黎模式建立的，城市由南向北逐渐发展。现在两条宽阔笔直的林荫大道贯穿市区的南北和东西。城市的南部多为古老建筑，有红砖盖的民房和一些迷宫般的弯曲小巷道。这里的许多市场仍留存着古代波斯的风貌。北城则多为现代化的建筑，有许多商店，出售进口的百货，也有一些高级大饭店。街道中心广场种有鲜花，还安装喷泉，形成街心公园。街头商店林立，人群熙攘。妇女穿着多为黑色，从黑色头巾、黑斗篷直到黑鞋，男人则衣着较为多样，从各色西装到穆斯林服饰都有。市内常住人口逾七百万，加上流动人口达一千万，是伊朗的最大城市。上下班时，街上车流如潮。
    德黑兰市有许多历史纪念文物和博物馆。一出德黑兰国际机场，便可看到气派雄伟、风格新颖的自由纪念塔，高四十五米，呈灰白色。它是一九七一年十月为纪念波斯帝国两千五百周年而建立的。沿着林荫大道直到北部山麓，便是巴列维王宫。宫院内有一片枫树林，王宫是一座两层楼高的花岗岩新式建筑，内部分别为巴列维国王的会客厅、餐厅、居室等，相当豪华。伊朗革命推翻王朝后，巴列维王宫向公众开放，改为“人民宫殿博物馆”。在市中心拉列公园一侧是建筑式样别致、形似织机的伊朗地毯博物馆。它藏有从伊朗各地收集的十六世纪到二十世纪的各种地毯的珍贵样品五千余件。参观者络绎不绝。此外还有艺术文化博物馆等，都反映了数千年光辉灿烂的波斯文化。
    八年的两伊战争自然也在德黑兰市留下了痕迹。街道年久失修，新的居民建筑也远远不能满足需要，日用生活必需品紧缺，米、肉、蛋等一部分实行配给，一部分可在自由市场买到，但价格昂贵。在街上行走也不时可看到因战争而致残的人。人们希望战争不再发生。
    在德黑兰市郊，人们在紧张地修复道路，改造工厂，新建学校和居民点。伊朗政府和人民把医治战争创伤，发展经济作为当务之急。今年七月新当选的总统拉夫桑贾尼上任后就指出：“没有经济上的独立，就没有政治上的独立可言”。政府宣布的五年经济计划重点是重建在战争中受到破坏的地区，恢复和发展石油工业、基础工业和基本消费品项目，以满足国内的急需，遏制物价上涨，提高人民的生活水平。伊朗政府为发展经济而采取的务实措施受到群众的欢迎。
