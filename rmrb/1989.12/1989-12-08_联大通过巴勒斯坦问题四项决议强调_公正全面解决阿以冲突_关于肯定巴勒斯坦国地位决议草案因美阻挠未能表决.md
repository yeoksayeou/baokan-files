The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly today passed four resolutions on the Palestinian issue with an overwhelming majority, emphasizing the urgent need for a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, with the core being the Palestinian issue.

The resolutions once again called for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal footing, and with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council.

The Assembly noted that some parties expressed the hope that within a limited period, the Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, would be placed under United Nations supervision as part of the Middle East peace process.

Regarding the fifth resolution draft on the Palestinian issue, which primarily affirms the statehood of Palestine, it was originally scheduled to be voted on by the Assembly today. However, due to the United States threatening to withhold its entire dues to the United Nations, the Arab sponsoring countries, in response to the call of the President of the General Assembly, Galba, made a compromise and did not insist on the General Assembly voting, and the Assembly therefore decided to postpone the consideration indefinitely.

The Chairman of the Arab Group, Egyptian Representative Badawi, spoke at the meeting, expressing deep regret over the United States' use of threats to achieve political purposes. He demanded that the item remain on the agenda.

The Yugoslav representative, Pejic, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, supported the legitimate demand to "affirm the statehood of Palestine," criticized the United States for exerting pressure, and stated that the use of the threat to plunge the United Nations into a crisis to oppose this demand is unacceptable.

    联大通过巴勒斯坦问题四项决议强调
    公正全面解决阿以冲突
    关于肯定巴勒斯坦国地位决议草案因美阻挠未能表决
    本报联合国12月6日电　记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天以压倒多数通过了关于巴勒斯坦问题的4项决议，强调急需公正和全面地解决阿、以冲突，其核心是巴勒斯坦问题。
    决议再次呼吁在联合国主持下召开中东问题国际和平会议，由包括巴勒斯坦解放组织在内的冲突各方以平等地位参加，安理会5个常任理事国也参加。
    大会注意到有些方面表示希望在有限期间内，将1967年以来被以色列占领的包括耶路撒冷在内的巴勒斯坦领土，置于联合国监督之下，作为中东和平进程的一部分。
    关于巴勒斯坦问题的第5项决议草案，主要内容是肯定巴勒斯坦国地位，原定由大会今天一起表决。但由于美国以停交其全部会费威胁联合国，阿拉伯提案国响应联大主席加尔巴的呼吁，进行了妥协，未坚持要求联大表决，大会因而决定无限期推迟审议。
    阿拉伯集团主席、埃及代表巴达威在会上发言，对美国为达到政治目的而采取的威胁手段深表遗憾。他要求此项议程仍然保留。
    南斯拉夫代表佩伊奇代表不结盟国家发言，支持“肯定巴勒斯坦国地位”的正当要求，批评美国施加压力并表示用把联合国投入危机的威胁手段来反对这一要求的做法是不能被接受的。
