A batch of 49 large and medium-sized coal and power construction projects have been approved by the State Council and will commence next year. According to a recent announcement by the State Planning Commission, these projects include 29 coal projects and 20 power projects.

Once these projects are completed, the national coal production capacity will increase by 49.24 million tons per year, the power generation capacity will increase by 10.5 million kilowatts, and there will be an additional 330 kilometers of 50,000-volt transmission lines. Among these projects, there are also three projects utilizing foreign capital and two energy-saving projects.

To ensure the timely commencement of these preparatory projects next year, the state has allocated over 700 million yuan for land acquisition, water supply, electricity supply, and road construction for these engineering projects.
