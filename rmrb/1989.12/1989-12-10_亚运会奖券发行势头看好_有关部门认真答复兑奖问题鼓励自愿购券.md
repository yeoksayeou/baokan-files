The sales of Asian Games lottery tickets are showing a positive trend. Many provincial and municipal offices in Beijing, after listening to the introduction of the Asian Games preparation situation, were inspired and expressed their willingness to contribute more in this area. Recently, the Asian Games Foundation has also taken serious steps to handle the prize redemption for the second round of the lottery, encouraging everyone to continue buying lottery tickets enthusiastically. They have also provided detailed responses to the public's inquiries regarding prize redemption and other issues.

The winning numbers for the second round of the lottery, determined by a draw, consist of a 10-digit number. The first 6 digits are the "group number" printed in the yellow frame of the lottery ticket, and the last 4 digits are printed in the blue window labeled "second round draw," which the purchaser reveals themselves. If the numbers on the lottery ticket match the announced winning numbers, the ticket wins. The following table makes this clear.

Winning numbers for 5 first prizes:

Group Number	Second Round Draw Number
012573	3381
021954	3323
030651	1101
040772	1067
052747	0053

Winning numbers for 5 encouragement prizes:

Group Number	Second Round Draw Number
010863	1560
020203	1644
032251	0002
041459	0040
052795	1724

Each first prize winner receives a prize of RMB 10,000 and is entitled to a 3-day free tour in Beijing. If the winner does not participate in the tour, they can receive RMB 1,500 instead. Each encouragement prize winner receives a 51-inch color television set. First prize winners should bring their winning lottery ticket and identification to 4 Shibei Hutong, Xicheng District, Beijing, to claim their prize by December 25.
