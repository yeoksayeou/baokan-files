In the December 1st editorial "Ideological and Political Work Must Be Strengthened," we discussed the necessity and importance of strengthening ideological and political work. Now, let's talk about improving ideological and political work.

Why does ideological and political work need improvement? This question must be answered by looking at our actual work. In recent years, many comrades have felt that ideological and political work is difficult to carry out. The reasons for this situation are twofold. On one hand, there has been interference from within the Party, which has significantly weakened ideological and political work. This situation is now beginning to be corrected, and the overall environment has changed. On the other hand, over the past decade of reform and opening up, the objective environment has shifted from being closed to open, and the focus has changed from "class struggle as the key link" to economic construction as the center. The thinking of our working objects has also undergone many changes with the development of the commodity economy. These changes require us to make corresponding adjustments to our ideological and political work. We should explore and summarize new experiences and broaden the avenues for ideological and political work. We firmly oppose those who use the pretext of "reforming" to deny the good traditions of ideological and political work, and those who downplay or weaken ideological and political work. In the future, we must strengthen ideological and political work, deeply conduct education on the Four Cardinal Principles, and help the broad masses of cadres and the people enhance their ability to discern and resist bourgeois liberalization, so as to ensure that all our undertakings proceed in the socialist direction. However, we should not avoid discussing the improvement of ideological and political work. We must be guided by Marxism and the Party's basic line, summarize the past, face the future, and while resolutely overcoming the weak and scattered state of ideological and political work in the previous period, continuously improve and innovate, so that ideological and political work can develop in a new way.

How to improve our ideological and political work remains to be explored and discussed by comrades on all fronts in practice. Since the reform and opening up, many comrades have actively explored and done a lot of work to improve ideological and political work, accumulating valuable experience. Summarizing these experiences, the most basic point is that ideological and political work must adhere to seeking truth from facts and combining theory with practice. Marxism needs to be instilled, and the view that denies instilling is completely wrong. However, to achieve the goal of instilling, we must pay attention to the art of instilling, and not turn instilling into abstract preaching that does not touch reality and does not solve practical problems. Dogmatic ideological and political work is difficult to achieve good results. The essence of Marxism is seeking truth from facts. For ideological work, it means being targeted. In the current rectification and deepening of reform, cadres and the masses have many doubts. Since it is said that the achievements of the past decade of reform are enormous and the country's economic strength has significantly increased, why is it necessary to emphasize "tightening our belts for a few years"? What impact will this have on the lives of the people? How to understand both preventing the "peaceful evolution" of external hostile forces and adhering to the policy of opening up to the outside world? And so on, all these need to be answered convincingly. To answer these questions, we must use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze the actual situation, and be reasonable and convincing, without any falsehood or exaggeration. If some questions cannot be answered for the time being, we should adopt a learning attitude and discuss and explore with the masses, and by no means should we adopt a high-handed attitude, using clichés and empty talk to scare people. Some regular ideological and political work, such as education on ideals, morality, and discipline, should also start from reality, and according to different working objects, analyze specific problems specifically, and prevent one-size-fits-all and generalizations.

Avoiding one-sidedness is an important aspect that needs to be paid attention to in improving ideological and political work. Focusing on only one aspect of the truth, or talking too much, will inevitably affect the credibility and effectiveness of ideological and political work. We have learned this lesson the hard way. For example, in the past few years, in the propaganda of "one center and two basic points," we have not done enough and effectively propagated the Four Cardinal Principles, with one hand strong and the other hand weak, allowing the bourgeois liberalization trend to spread, and this big lesson should be firmly remembered. When emphasizing the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, we should not neglect the propaganda of reform and opening up. For the current economic situation, we should also guide everyone to form a comprehensive and correct understanding, fully estimate the current difficulties, and also see the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, so as to both maintain a clear mind and not lose confidence.

The methods and approaches of ideological and political work should be diversified and pay attention to scientificity. Effective forms such as giving speeches and lectures should be insisted on and developed. Democratic and equal dialogue and discussion are also good methods. We should also encourage the masses to inspire and educate themselves. In terms of society, we should also develop various educational resources and widely use literature and art, news and publishing, cultural entertainment, and other channels to carry out ideological and political work. Ideological and political work should conform to the laws of people's thinking and behavior development. Now, more and more people realize that ideological and political work is a science, and on this basis, carrying out research will definitely achieve good results.

In the past half year, many comrades have put forward many good opinions and suggestions for strengthening ideological and political work, and have devoted a lot of effort to improving ideological and political work. Ideological and political work has played an increasingly important role in stabilizing the situation and rectification, which is very gratifying. Strengthening and improving ideological and political work is an important issue related to the prosperity of the Party and the people's cause, and we hope that all Party comrades will contribute their wisdom and strength to it.

    通过改进达到加强
    ——再谈加强思想政治工作
    本报评论员
    本报在12月1日《思想政治工作首先是要加强》这篇评论中，论述了加强思想政治工作的必要性与重要性，现在谈谈改进思想政治工作的问题。
    思想政治工作为什么要改进？这要从我们的工作实际谈起。近年来，不少同志都感到思想政治工作难做。造成这种状况的原因，一方面是由于来自党内的干扰，使思想政治工作受到了很大削弱，这种情况现在已经开始得到纠正，大气候变了。另一方面，则是由于改革开放10年来，客观环境由过去的封闭变成了开放，任务由过去的“以阶级斗争为纲”变成了以经济建设为中心，工作对象的思想观念也随着商品经济的发展发生了诸多变化。这些变化，要求我们思想政治工作也要作相应的改变，应该探索和总结新鲜经验，拓宽思想政治工作的路子。对于那种借口“改造”而否定思想政治工作的好传统，对于淡化、削弱思想政治工作的错误倾向，我们是坚决反对的。今后我们必须加强思想政治工作，深入进行四项基本原则的教育，帮助广大干部和群众提高辨别和抵制资产阶级自由化的能力，以保证我们的各项事业沿着社会主义的方向前进。但是，也不能因此而讳言思想政治工作的改进。我们必须以马克思主义和党的基本路线为指导，总结过去，面向未来，在坚决克服前一时期思想政治工作软弱涣散状态的同时，不断改进和创新，使思想政治工作有一个新的发展。
  怎样改进我们的思想政治工作，有待于各条战线的同志在实践中集思广益、探讨研究。改革开放以来，很多同志为改进思想政治工作积极探索，做了大量工作，积累了宝贵的经验。综合这些经验，最基本的一条，就是思想政治工作要坚持实事求是，理论联系实际。马克思主义需要灌输，否定灌输的观点是完全错误的。但是，要达到灌输的目的，必须讲究灌输的艺术，不能把灌输搞成从概念到概念，不接触实际、不解决实际问题的抽象说教。教条式的思想政治工作，很难取得好的效果。马克思主义的灵魂就是实事求是，对于做思想工作来说，就是要有针对性。在当前的治理整顿、深化改革中，干部和群众有不少疑虑。既然说10年改革成就巨大，国家经济实力显著增强，为什么还要强调“过几年紧日子”？这会给群众生活带来什么影响？怎样认识既要防止外来敌对势力的“和平演变”，又要坚持实行对外开放？如此等等，都需要做出有说服力的回答。要回答这些问题，必须用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法分析实际情况，做到有理有据，来不得半点虚浮和虚假。有的问题一时解答不好，也要抱着一个学习的态度，和群众一起讨论和探讨，切不能摆出高高在上的架子，以套话大话训人吓人。一些经常性的思想政治工作，比如理想、品德、纪律等方面的教育，也要从实际出发，根据不同的工作对象，具体问题具体分析，防止一刀切，一般化。
    防止片面性，是改进思想政治工作应该注意的一个重要方面。只讲一个方面的道理，或者话讲得过了头，其结果必然影响思想政治工作的信誉和效力，这方面的苦头，我们是吃过的。比如近几年在关于“一个中心、两个基本点”的宣传上，我们对四项基本原则的宣传很不充分、很不得力，一手硬，一手软，使资产阶级自由化思潮得以泛滥，这个大教训值得牢牢记取。在强调坚持四项基本原则的时候，也不要忽视对改革、开放的宣传。对当前的经济形势，也要引导大家树立全面的正确的认识，既要充分估计当前的困难，又要看到克服困难的有利条件，这样才能做到既保持清醒头脑，又不失去信心。
    思想政治工作的方式方法要多样化，要注意科学性。作报告、上课等行之有效的好形式，要坚持和发展。民主、平等的对话、讨论，也是个好办法。还要鼓励群众自己启发、教育自己。从社会范围来说，还要开发多方面的教育资源，广泛利用文学艺术、新闻出版、文化娱乐等各种渠道来开展思想政治工作。思想政治工作要符合人们思想和行为发展的规律。现在有越来越多的人认识到思想政治工作是一门科学，在这个认识基础上开展研究，一定能收到好的效果。
    近半年来，许多同志对加强思想政治工作提出了许多好的意见和建议，为改进思想政治工作倾注了大量心血，思想政治工作在稳定局势、治理整顿中发挥着越来越大的作用，这是十分可喜的。思想政治工作的加强和改进是关系到党和人民的事业兴旺发达的一个重要课题，希望全党同志都能为之贡献智慧和力量。
