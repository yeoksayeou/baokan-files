	Multiple bomb explosions have occurred recently in the southern U.S. states of Georgia and Alabama, targeting legal professionals, resulting in two deaths and one injury.

	On December 18th, Robert Robinson, a city council member and lawyer in Savannah, Georgia, was blown up by a mail bomb in his office, losing his right arm and left hand, and died two hours later in the hospital.

	On the same day, police evacuated staff from the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, and removed another mail bomb from the fifth floor of the building.

	Two days earlier, Judge Robert Vance of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was killed by a similar bomb at his home in Alabama, and his wife was seriously injured.

	The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, with approximately 60% of its cases related to drugs. Therefore, these bombings are believed to be related to drug cases and may have been carried out by Colombian drug trafficking organizations. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美南部发生数起炸弹爆炸事件
    美国南部佐治亚州和亚拉巴马州近日连续发生针对法律工作者的炸弹爆炸事件，造成二人死亡，一人受伤。
    十八日，佐治亚州萨凡纳市市政委员兼律师罗伯特·鲁滨逊在他的办公室里被一枚邮件炸弹炸飞了右臂和左手，二小时后死在医院里。
    同一天，警察疏散了位于佐治亚州首府亚特兰大市的美国第十一巡回上诉法院的工作人员，从该法院的五层大楼内起出了另一枚邮件炸弹。
    在此之前二天，第十一巡回上诉法院的法官罗伯特·万斯在他的亚拉巴马州家中被一枚类似的炸弹炸死，他的妻子被炸成重伤。
    美国第十一巡回上诉法院辖有亚拉巴马、佐治亚和佛罗里达三个州，其受理的案件中约百分之六十与毒品有关。因此，这几起炸弹事件据认为与毒品案件有关，可能是哥伦比亚毒品走私集团所为。（据新华社）
