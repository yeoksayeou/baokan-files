Two types of tape save the country $8 million in foreign exchange annually

    According to a report from our newspaper, the Luoyang Rubber Products Factory in Henan Province has successfully produced polyester high-strength fan belts and internal-tooth trim triangular belts. These products have achieved the goal of replacing imports in China's tape industry, saving the country over $8 million in foreign exchange annually.

    With the development of China's automotive industry, a large amount of foreign exchange is spent each year to import various types of transmission belts. After this key project was assigned to the Luoyang Rubber Products Factory, they organized engineering and technical personnel to use domestic materials for research and development, as well as trial production. After nearly two years of trial use, it was proven that the main technical indicators have reached and exceeded the current international standards. The factory has now started mass production.

    两种胶带每年为国家节省外汇八百万美元
    本报讯　河南省洛阳市橡胶制品厂生产的聚脂强力层风扇带和内齿型切边三角带，率先在我国胶带行业实现代替进口的目标，每年可为国家节约外汇800余万美元。
    随着我国汽车工业的发展，每年需花大量外汇进口各种传动带，这个攻关项目下达给洛阳橡胶制品厂后，他们组织工程技术人员采用国产材料进行研制和试生产，小批量投产后，经近两年的试用证明，主要技术指标达到和超过现行国际标准。目前该厂已投入大批量生产。
