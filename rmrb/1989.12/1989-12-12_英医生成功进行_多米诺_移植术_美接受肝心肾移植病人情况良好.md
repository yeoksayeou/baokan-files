British doctors have successfully performed a "domino" transplant operation.

The London Harefield Hospital cardiothoracic surgeon Magdi Yacoub recently transplanted the heart and lungs of a 13-year-old boy into a 24-year-old man, and simultaneously transplanted the heart of the 24-year-old man into another patient.

The 24-year-old man was suffering from cystic fibrosis. This is a genetic lung disease that is incurable, and patients usually die in their twenties. The hearts of cystic fibrosis patients are often particularly good, but lung transplant surgery is complex and has a lower success rate, so it is better to use the method of simultaneous heart and lung transplantation. The 13-year-old Greek boy who donated his heart and lungs died tragically from a gunshot wound while handling a hunting rifle.

Dr. Yacoub completed this heart-lung transplant operation in 5 hours. Britain performs about 100 heart-lung transplant operations each year. The success of the "domino" transplant operation means that more organ transplants can be performed.

According to a report by the Associated Press, a spokesman for the University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian Hospital said that the patient, Mrs. Martin, who underwent a simultaneous liver, heart, and kidney transplant on December 3, is gradually improving. She is now conscious and can talk to her husband.

Mrs. Martin's simultaneous transplant of three organs is a world first. She is currently being treated with the Japanese anti-rejection drug FK-506. This drug is more effective than the previously used anti-rejection drugs.

    英医生成功进行“多米诺”移植术
    美接受肝心肾移植病人情况良好
    新华社伦敦12月10日电　（记者王国瑞）英国医生成功地进行了一例“多米诺”移植术。
    伦敦哈雷费尔德医院心脏外科医生马格迪·亚可布，最近把一个13岁男孩的心和肺移植给一名24岁的男子，同时又把这名男子的心脏移植给另一名病人。
    这名男子患囊性纤维变性。这是肺部遗传性的不治之症，患者通常在20多岁死亡。囊性纤维变性患者的心脏往往特别好，但是，肺移植手术复杂，成功率较低，不如采用心和肺同时移植的方法。捐出心和肺的13岁希腊男孩是因摆弄猎枪，而不幸中弹死亡的。
    亚可布医生用了5小时完成了这例心肺移植手术。英国每年大约进行100例心肺移植术。“多米诺”移植术的成功意味着能够进行更多的器官移植。
    新华社北京12月9日电　据美联社报道，美国匹兹堡长老大学医院的发言人说，12月3日在这里接受肝心肾同时移植手术的病人马丁女士的情况逐步好转。目前她神志清醒，已能同她丈夫说话。
    马丁女士同时接受3个器官的移植在世界上属首例。她正在接受一种日本抗排异药物FK—506的治疗。这种药物比以前用的抗排异药物更有效。
