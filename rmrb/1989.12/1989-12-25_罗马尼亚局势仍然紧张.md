Romania's forces supporting Ceausescu and those opposing him engaged in fierce street battles in the capital, Bucharest, and the situation remains tense.

From the morning to the evening of the 23rd, gunshots echoed intermittently throughout the city, occasionally punctuated by cannon fire. The main battles took place around the television building, radio station, and post office, as well as in some residential areas. Television and radio broadcasts were temporarily interrupted. The newly established Romanian National Salvation Front Committee called on troops stationed outside the capital to quickly march to Bucharest to reinforce the Ministry of Defense, military academies, and other units. This morning, Bucharest Radio broadcast that the National Salvation Front Committee "has taken control of all strategic locations nationwide."

Reports from Brasov, Sibiu, Timisoara, and other cities indicate that fighting continues.

Bucharest is currently in a state of anarchy, with traffic congestion, many factories halting production, and shops closing. Some shops have been looted.

    罗马尼亚局势仍然紧张
    新华社布加勒斯特12月24日凌晨电　罗马尼亚支持齐奥塞斯库的部队和反对他的部队之间在首都布加勒斯特市内展开激烈的巷战，局势仍然紧张。
    23日从早到晚，市区枪声时停时起，有时响起炮声。战斗主要在电视大楼、电台和邮电大楼附近以及部分居民区进行，电视广播曾一度中断。新成立的罗马尼亚救国阵线委员会23日通过电视广播呼吁驻外地的军队迅速赶往布加勒斯特增援国防部、军事学院等单位。布加勒斯特电台今天清晨广播说，救国阵线委员会“已控制了全国所有战略要地”。
    从布拉索夫、锡比乌、蒂米什瓦拉等城市也传来战斗继续进行的消息。
    布加勒斯特目前已处于无政府状态，交通堵塞，许多工厂停工，商店不营业，有的商店被抢劫。
