Hunan Province is rich in revolutionary relics and has unique advantages in strengthening traditional education. A reporter from this newspaper, Wu Xinghua, reported from Changsha on December 5th: The cultural relics department of Hunan Province uses revolutionary relics and adopts various forms to strengthen revolutionary traditional education.

Hunan is one of the birthplaces of the Chinese revolution. Over the past century, especially since the founding of our party, many major revolutionary historical events, revolutionary leaders, and revolutionary martyrs have left behind numerous revolutionary sites, relics, and artifacts in Hunan. Currently, the province has 40 key cultural relics protection units at the provincial level or above, along with 57 associated items, 3 martyrs' memorials from the socialist revolution and construction period, and 19 revolutionary memorial halls, collecting approximately 70,000 artifacts.

Since 1984, the cultural relics department of Hunan Province has utilized repaired revolutionary sites and the former residences of elder revolutionary leaders to hold 35 restored exhibitions and 23 auxiliary exhibitions. They have received 7.5 million visitors, with the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall receiving 2.5 million visitors and the Liu Shaoqi Memorial Hall, which opened last year, receiving 400,000 visitors. Various local memorial halls and cultural relics protection units have changed their working methods from "waiting for visitors to come" to simplifying and condensing their exhibitions into small exhibitions. They form propaganda teams to go to grassroots units for exhibition propaganda. Some even maintain long-term partnerships with grassroots units for fixed-point propaganda, expanding the scope of education. The Lei Feng Memorial Hall has been conducting grassroots propaganda for 21 years, with nearly 320,000 visitors in the past five years.

The cultural relics department of Hunan Province also organizes exhibitions in conjunction with the Party's ideological and political education work at various times. Since 1984, they have organized 154 exhibitions. From July to September this year, the Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau organized several memorial halls and museums to hold the "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China—Review of China's Nearly 100 Years of History" and the "Beijing Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Riot Exhibition," which were displayed in Changsha, Changde, and other places. In less than a month, the number of visitors reached 100,000. The cultural relics department of Hunan Province also conducts revolutionary traditional education through seminars, lectures, and other forms.

    湖南大地遍布革命文物  加强传统教育得天独厚
    本报长沙12月5日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省文物部门运用革命文物，采取多种形式，加强革命传统教育。
    湖南是中国革命的策源地之一。近百年来，特别是我党建立以来，许多重大的革命历史事件，革命领袖和革命先烈在湖南留下了许多革命遗址、遗迹和遗物。现在，全省有省级以上文物重点保护单位40处，连同附属物共57处，社会主义革命与建设时期烈士纪念物3处，建立革命纪念馆19个，共征集文物约7万件。
    1984年以来，湖南文物部门利用维修好的革命遗址、老一辈无产阶级革命家的故居，举办35个复原陈列和23个辅助陈列，共接待观众750万人次，其中毛泽东同志纪念馆接待250万人次，刘少奇同志纪念馆去年开馆，接待观众40万人次。各地纪念馆和文物保护单位还改变“等观众上门”的工作方式，把本单位的陈列展览精简压缩成小展览，组成宣传小分队，到基层单位开展陈列宣传，有的还长期与基层单位挂钩，定点宣传，扩大教育面。雷锋纪念馆21年来坚持下基层宣传，近5年间观众达32万人次。
    湖南省文物部门还配合党在各个时期的思想政治教育工作，适时举办陈列展览。1984年以来，共办陈列展览154个。今年7月至9月，省文物局组织部分纪念馆、博物馆举办了《没有共产党就没有新中国——中国近百年历史回顾展》、《北京平息反革命暴乱展览》，分别在长沙、常德等地展出，不到1个月，观众就达10万人次。湖南文物部门还通过座谈会、演讲会等形式，开展革命传统教育。
