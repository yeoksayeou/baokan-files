The mysterious and colorful rainbow stone, long praised as a "gift from heaven," has had its secrets of formation and aesthetic value unveiled by geologists and chemists.

It is reported that rainbow stones are found in the gravel layers of Liuhe and Yizheng in Nanjing. Scientific identification shows that the composition of rainbow stones includes agate, opal, jade, quartz, crystal, and flint, among others. The most valuable in terms of aesthetics is the rainbow agate. The various enchanting colors of rainbow stones are determined by their mineral composition. Red hues are due to iron, blue to copper, purple to manganese, and yellow semi-transparent hues are due to colloidal silica opal. The jade green color contains green minerals. Additionally, because the surface of rainbow stones has extremely tiny pores, water molecules fill these pores in clear water, causing refraction and enhancing the visual appeal.

    雨花石斑斓面纱被揭开
    新华社南京十二月三日电　（记者张伟弟）纹奇色艳的雨花石一向被誉为“天赐佳石”，它的生成及其审美方面的奥秘已被地质和化学科研人员揭开。
    据介绍，雨花石产于南京六合、仪征等地的砾石层。科学鉴定表明，雨花石的成分有玛瑙质、蛋白质、碧玉质、石英质、水晶质、石髓和燧石等，其中审美价值极高的是雨花玛瑙石。雨花石各种迷离的色彩也由矿物质的化学成分所决定，其中赤红者为铁，蓝者为铜，紫者为锰，黄色半透明的是二氧化硅胶体石髓，翡翠色则含绿色矿物。又因为雨花石表面有极其微小的空隙，所以在清水中水分子填塞其内而产生折光，更能增加观赏情趣。
