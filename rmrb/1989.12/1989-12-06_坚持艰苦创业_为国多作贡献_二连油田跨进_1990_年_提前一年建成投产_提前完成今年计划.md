The state's key construction project—the Erlian Oilfield in Inner Mongolia—has been completed and put into operation one year ahead of schedule thanks to the tenacious efforts and hard work of the broad masses of petroleum workers. By December 5, the oilfield had also completed its annual production plan of 300,000 tons of crude oil 26 days ahead of schedule. The early completion and operation of this oilfield not only add new vitality to the development of the petroleum industry but, more importantly, will play a significant role in promoting the economic construction of Inner Mongolia. On December 5, the China National Petroleum Corporation and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region Government sent a congratulatory telegram to the Erlian Oilfield.

The Erlian Oilfield is located in the vast grasslands of Xilingol in Inner Mongolia. Its construction and development are of great significance to the development and prosperity of the Inner Mongolian economy. The China National Petroleum Corporation originally planned to complete the construction of this oilfield in three years by 1990. The more than 10,000 workers of the North China Oilfield, who are responsible for exploration, development, and construction, have carried forward the Daqing spirit, braved the cold and sandstorms, and overcome the harsh natural environment and various unfavorable factors. They have finally completed the construction of a new oilfield with an annual production capacity of 800,000 tons, along with supporting facilities for water, electricity, roads, and communications one year ahead of schedule.

The broad masses of workers at the Erlian Exploration and Development Company, which manages the oilfield, are over 80% young workers, and most of them are recent graduates from technical schools. They are not accustomed to the oilfield, especially when facing a modernized oilfield, they lack technical and management experience. The company leadership, in response to this situation, strengthened on-the-job training and organized experienced old workers to provide guidance and support at the grassroots level. They learned both theoretical knowledge and practical operations. After a short period, more than 90% of the workers on duty obtained qualified operation certificates, ensuring the safe production of the oilfield.

The leaders and administrative staff of the Erlian Company pay attention to setting an example in everything they do. They take the Daqing people as their model, moving the production command department to the oilfield site, implementing forward command and service, “production command to the site, material supply to the site, design and research to the site, living services to the site, and ideological and political work to the site.” After entering the winter, the temperature here sometimes drops to below -30 degrees Celsius. The company leaders and administrative staff implement a system of taking responsibility for teams, stations, and wells. From the company manager and party secretary to the heads of departments and the broad administrative staff, everyone has their respective teams, stations, and wells to be responsible for. Now, every day you can see leaders and administrative staff going to the grassroots level, visiting workstations, and working, eating, and living with the workers.

Currently, the four crude oil processing and transfer stations, 30 calculation and distribution stations, nearly 300 oil wells and water injection wells, and large and small gathering stations of the Erlian Oilfield are operating normally under the severe cold test. The 361-kilometer long-distance oil pipeline is continuously transporting crude oil to Saikhan Tala in Inner Mongolia. It is reported that this oilfield has new discoveries in the surrounding areas.

### 坚持艰苦创业　为国多作贡献  二连油田跨进1990年  提前一年建成投产　提前完成今年计划

    坚持艰苦创业　为国多作贡献
    二连油田跨进1990年
    提前一年建成投产　提前完成今年计划
    本报讯　国家重点建设项目——内蒙古二连油田，经过广大石油职工的顽强拚搏和艰苦奋斗，已于今年提前一年建成投产。截至12月5日又提前26天超额完成国家下达的年度生产原油30万吨的计划。这个油田的提前建成和投产，不仅为石油工业发展增添了新的活力，更重要的是将对内蒙古的经济建设起到重要推动作用。12月5日，中国石油天然气总公司和内蒙古自治区政府向二连油田发了贺电。
    二连油田位于祖国内蒙古锡林郭勒大草原上。它的建成和开发对发展和繁荣内蒙古民族经济有着重要意义。中国石油天然气总公司原计划用三年时间到1990年建成这个油田。担负勘探开发建设的华北油田万余名职工，继承和发扬大庆精神，不畏严寒和风沙，克服了恶劣的自然环境和各种不利因素，终于提前一年基本建成一个年生产能力达80万吨，以及水、电、路、通讯等配套的新油田。
    管理这个油田的二连勘探开发公司广大职工，80％以上是年轻工人，而多数又是刚刚从技校毕业的学生，他们来到油田很不习惯，特别是面对一个现代化设备的油田，缺少技术和管理经验。公司领导针对这一特点，强化岗位培训，组织有丰富经验的老工人到基层传帮带。既学理论知识，又学实际操作。经过很短时间，90％以上的上岗工人取得了合格操作证书，保证了油田安全生产。
    二连公司的领导和机关干部注意处处以身作则。他们以大庆人为榜样，把生产指挥部门搬到油田工地，实行靠前指挥，靠前服务，“生产指挥到现场、材料供应到现场、设计科研到现场、生活服务到现场、思想政治工作到现场。进入冬季后，这里气温有时降到零下30多度，公司领导和机关干部实行包队、包站、包井制度，从公司经理、党委书记到机关部室主任，以及广大机关干部都有各自承包的队、站、井。现在，每天都可以看到领导和机关干部下基层、走岗位，与工人同吃同住同劳动的场面。
    目前，二连油田已投产的4座处理原油的联合站、接转站，30座计配站和近300口油井、注水井，大小集输站，在严寒的考验下，生产运转正常，361公里长距离输油管道正源源不断地把原油输往内蒙古赛汗塔拉。据悉，这个油田在外围地区又有新的发现。
