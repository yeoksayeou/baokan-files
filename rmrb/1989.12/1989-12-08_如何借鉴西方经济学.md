Recently, the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences organized a scholarly discussion on how to learn from Western economic theories for China's economic reforms. The discussion mainly focused on the following aspects.

1. Attention should be paid to the premises of borrowing Western economic theories. Most comrades believe that the academic circles in China have blindly introduced Western economic theories. If we ignore the theoretical foundations and real premises on which Western economics is based, even if a theory is effective in the West, it will be difficult to apply it in China. For example, Keynesian economists superficially devalue financial policy, but in essence, they emphasize increasing the quantity of money to lower interest rates, stimulate investment, and attempt to increase effective demand for consumption and investment through the multiplier effect to achieve full employment and economic prosperity. From 1978, when China began its reforms, to 1984, when economic growth reached its peak, the theoretical circles strongly advocated the role of money as the "primary driving force." The state bank lent money to economic entities, causing the credit scale to grow unprecedentedly and even lose control, laying the seeds for the continuous price increases and worsening inflation since 1985. Obviously, China's monetary and financial policies in the previous few years were greatly influenced by Keynesian economic theory. In the mid-1980s, China faced the problem of further strengthening macro-control. At this time, the influence of the monetary school gradually overshadowed Keynesianism. The monetarist school, represented by Friedman, advocates adhering to the "principle of a stable nominal money supply growth rate," using changes in the quantity of money to achieve the goals of eliminating inflation and promoting economic growth. The macro-tightening in 1985 and the tightening of the monetary policy since 1987, although out of necessity, were to a great extent non-normal experiments of monetarist policy proposals in China's reforms. From the current economic situation, simply controlling the money supply has not curbed the inflation trend and may even push the Chinese economy into a stagflation situation. Again, for example, Western central bank monetary policy contains three basic premises: (1) the central bank is independent of the government, and monetary policy is not influenced by fiscal policy; (2) there is a clear property rights system for enterprises; (3) there is a complete banking system and financial scale. These premises are not met in China, so the application of this theory often results in one side where money cannot be controlled and the other side where prices cannot be liberalized. For example, in regulating international trade imbalances, we have adopted the devaluation policy from Western international trade theory to stimulate exports and curb imports. However, the important condition for this policy is that the export goods have a large demand elasticity, and the domestic supply elasticity of these goods can correspond to it. Otherwise, under the condition of supply rigidity, even if the demand elasticity is large, the export volume will not increase; on the other hand, since the reform, people have had a continuous rigid demand for imported high-end consumer goods, and many budget-constrained enterprises have had an impulse to expand their demand for imported goods. Thus, currency devaluation not only fails to significantly curb imports but also produces a series of negative effects.

2. The methodology of modern Western economics should be emphasized. Some comrades believe that one of the research methods of modern Western economics is the abstract method, that is, the establishment and use of abstract categories. Like Marx's "labor" category, the marginalist's "utility" and Keynes's "psychological tendency" are also abstract categories. These cannot be directly found in social and economic reality, but without these categories, specific economic facts cannot be theoretically explained. Some comrades believe that borrowing Western economic theories such as property rights theory, price theory, macro-regulation, and industrial policy theory is undoubtedly necessary. However, we should recognize their limitations. Even if China's current economic problems are similar to those that the West has faced or is facing, due to the differences in the production mechanisms of these problems, a theory that is effective when applied to Western countries may have significant deviations when applied to China. The key to "Western learning for practical use" is not specific economic theories but the economic methodology that transcends certain time and space conditions. The most basic and general method in Western economics is the empirical and normative research methods. The main direction of our methodology borrowing should be empirical research. While China's past economic research has been largely a kind of research without empirical basis, a "vacuum-to-vacuum" type of research. Currently, to regulate China's economic activities, it is urgent to reveal the deep-seated mechanisms of China's economic changes, which can only be recognized in the interaction between the subject and the object.

    如何借鉴西方经济学
    最近，中国社会科学院研究生院组织了中国经济改革如何借鉴西方经济学成果的学术讨论会。会议主要围绕以下方面进行了讨论。
    一、借鉴西方经济学理论应注意其前提。多数同志认为，目前我国学术界对西方经济理论有盲目引进之嫌。如果我们忽视了西方经济学赖以存在的理论基础和现实前提，即便是在西方行之有效的理论，应用于我国也难以奏效。如凯恩斯主义者表面上贬低金融政策，实质上强调增加货币数量以降低利率、刺激投资，企图通过投资乘数的作用来增大消费和投资的有效需求，以达到实现充分就业和繁荣经济的目的。我国从1978年改革伊始到1984年经济增长达到顶峰的六年间，理论界极力主张发挥货币的“第一推动力”作用，国家银行向经济实体争相放贷，使信贷规模空前增长乃至失控，埋下了1985年以来物价持续上涨、通货膨胀日趋严重的种子。显然，我国前几年的货币金融政策与凯恩斯经济理论影响很有关系。80年代中期以后，我国面临进一步加强宏观控制的问题，这时货币学派的影响逐渐压倒了凯恩斯主义。以弗里德曼为代表的货币学派主张遵循“稳定的名义货币供应增长率原则”，通过变动货币数量，以实现既消除通货膨胀、又促进经济增长的目的。1985年的宏观紧缩和1987年以来的再度抽紧银根，虽然出于无奈，但在很大程度上是货币学派政策主张在我国改革中的非正常试验。从目前的经济情况来看，单纯控制货币的供应量并没有抑制住通货膨胀势头，反而可能使中国经济陷入滞胀的局面。再如，西方中央银行货币政策暗含三个基本前提：（1）中央银行独立于政府，货币政策运用不依财政政策为转移；（2）有一个产权明晰的企业制度；（3）有完备的银行体系及金融规模。这些前提在我国并不具备，因此，运用这一理论的结果，往往是一方面货币管不住，另一方面价格放不开。又如，在调节国际收支不平衡方面，我们吸收了西方国际贸易理论，采取了贬值政策，目的是刺激出口和抑制进口。可这一政策的重要条件是出口商品有较大需求弹性，且这种商品的国内供给弹性能与之相对应。否则，在供给刚性条件下，需求弹性再大也不会扩大出口额；而另一方面，改革以来，人们对进口高档消费品有着持续的刚性需求，而许多预算约束疲软的厂商，对进口商品又存在着需求扩张冲动。这样，货币贬值不仅不能使进口额明显得到抑制，反而会产生一系列负效应。
    二、对现代西方经济学应借重其方法论。一些同志认为，现代西方经济学的研究方法之一是抽象方法，即抽象范畴的建立和运用。同马克思的“劳动”范畴一样，边际学派的“效用”，凯恩斯的“心理倾向”等也都是抽象范畴。这些并不能在社会经济实际中找到直接的对应物，而如没有这些范畴，具体的经济事实则无从作理论的阐明。有的同志认为，我们借鉴西方经济理论中的产权理论、价格理论、宏观调节和产业政策理论等，无疑是必要的。但是应认识到其局限性。即使中国经济目前面临的某些问题和西方曾经面临或正在面临的问题相似，但由于这类问题双方生产机制的差异，同样一种理论应用于西方国家是有效的，应用于我国则可能发生很大偏差。“洋为中用”的关键并不是具体的经济理论，而是超越一定时空条件的经济学方法论。西方经济学中最基本、最一般的方法就是实证和规范研究方法。我们对方法论借鉴的主方向应该是实证研究。而我国以往的经济研究基本上是一种无实证基础的、“空对空”式的研究。目前规范我国经济活动，迫切需要揭示我国经济变化的深层机制，这只能在主、客体的交互作用中去认识。（摘自《理论信息报》）
