A Thousand Miles of Journey, All Heartfelt
—Recalling the Excellent Service of Train 289/290 of Jinzhou Train Section

A Cup of Water, Enduring Affection

During long journeys, passengers most need water, but the water tanks on trains have limited capacity and sometimes can't even supply enough cold water, let alone hot water.

However, on train 289/290, water is guaranteed for the entire journey regardless of the situation. The crew members go to great lengths to ensure the water tanks are full. To make sure passengers can drink hot water, they fill the thermos flasks with water before departure; after the train starts, they deliver boiling water for tea; when the car is crowded, they pass water through the passengers; during long stops at major stations, they bring water to passengers through the windows from the platform.

A Thin Card, Deep Affection

"The quality of service on a train, whether good or bad, excellent or poor, ultimately depends on what the passengers say." The crew of train 289/290 insists on using passenger satisfaction as the standard for evaluating service quality. Whenever the train departs from Jinzhou, the train conductor distributes numbered "Passenger Feedback Cards" to one long-distance passenger in each car. This passenger collects opinions from all passengers in the car, evaluating the service attitude, language, water supply, and train announcements of the crew members, and writes the feedback on the card. The team compiles and analyzes the feedback monthly, and even if there is 1% dissatisfaction, they will find the cause and improve the service. Train 289 departs from Beijing at 20:10 every day. The train announcements at this time coincide with the "News Broadcast" on Central People's Radio. Passengers have complained about this. They record the broadcast and replay it after 21:00, allowing passengers to hear the important news of the evening while ensuring normal broadcast operations before and after the train's departure.

The crew members learned from the feedback cards that passengers hope for a comfortable travel environment. To this end, they work tirelessly. Every day, there is always a crew member on rest duty cleaning the train depot, regardless of the weather. They divide the train's hygiene into 36 control points and implement point-to-point control. Although acid washing the toilets is not within their job description, they do it regularly to keep the toilets clean and odor-free.

Small Matters, Heartfelt Care

Train attendant Wu Shìwěi is a new crew member this year. Once, a young woman with mental illness started causing a disturbance during the night. Passengers couldn't rest. The patient's father said that the patient's agitation was because the train announcements had stopped, and she would calm down if there was singing and music. Wu Shìwěi couldn't borrow a tape recorder from the neighboring car. He stood by the patient and softly sang to her. The singing indeed calmed the patient's mood.

An 80-year-old man traveled to Beijing to visit relatives. Along the way, train attendant Wáng Guāngqín took care of him warmly. When they arrived in Beijing and no one was there to pick him up, Wáng Guāngqín took him to the hotel to rest. Train conductor Liú Chūnyīng ran for over two hours to find the old man's relatives, leaving the old man so touched that he didn't know what to say.

    车行千里总是情
    ——记锦州列车段289／290次列车优质服务的事迹
    孟军　良福　刘昕
    杯水情长
    在漫长的旅途中，旅客们最需要的是水，而列车上的水箱容量有限，有时往往连凉水都供应不上，开水就更难以满足要求了。
    不过，在289／290次列车上，无论什么情况下都保证全程供水。乘务员们想方设法使水箱满水。为了让旅客们都能喝到开水，他们在始发前先将保温桶灌满水；开车后为旅客送上冲茶用的不落滚的开水；车厢人多拥挤时就通过旅客往里传水；大站停车时间长就从站台上通过车窗给旅客送水。
    薄卡情深
    “列车上的服务工作是好是差，是优是劣，最终要由旅客来评说。”289／290次列车乘务员坚持把旅客是否满意作为衡量服务工作好坏的标准。每当列车从锦州始发后，列车长便将编了号码的《征求旅客意见卡》发给每节车厢的一名长途旅客，由这名旅客征集本节车厢旅客的意见，对列车员的服务态度、服务语言、开水供应、列车广播等逐项进行评定，把意见写在卡上。车队按月进行统计分析，即使有1％的不满意，也要查明原因，改进服务。289次列车每天20点10分从北京开车。这个时间的列车广播正好与中央人民广播电台的新闻联播节目相重合，旅客有反映。他们就把联播节目录下来，21点后再重新播放，既让旅客听到了当晚的重要新闻，又保证了列车始发前后的正常广播业务。
    乘务员们从意见卡上了解到，旅客们希望有个舒适的旅行环境。为此，他们付出艰辛的劳动。每天，总有一班休班的乘务员到车库搞清扫，风雨不误。他们把列车上的卫生清扫分为36个控制点，实行定点控制。厕所酸洗虽然按规定不属于他们的工作范围，他们也定期酸洗，使厕所长期保持干净无味。
    事小情切
    列车员武士伟是今年才上车的新列车员。有一次，一位患精神病的女青年在进入夜间行车后，突然大吵大闹。车厢里的旅客无法休息。病人的父亲说，病人狂躁不安是因为列车广播停止了，只要有歌声和音乐，她就能安定下来。小武到邻近车厢去借收录机没借到。小武便站在病人旁边，为她轻轻地唱起歌来。歌声果然使病人的情绪稳定了。
    一位80岁老人到北京探亲。一路上，列车员王广琴热情照顾。到北京没人接，王广琴把他带到公寓休息。列车长刘春英跑了两个多小时找来老人的亲属，感动得那位老人不知说啥才好。
