The Anhui Provincial Committee adopted the method of "training through meetings" to gather over 500 county-level and above party and government leaders in Hefei from November 24 to 30 to further study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. Over the course of seven days, they focused on the province's situation, with the most discussions centering around the words "stability" and "agriculture."

Anhui is a major agricultural province and the birthplace of the "Household Contract Responsibility System." Over the past 10 years of reform, grain production has seen a bumper harvest for six years, rising from the 10th position nationwide to the 6th, with a cumulative output of over 18 billion kilograms of commercial grain. Although this year faced significant natural disasters, the total grain production is expected to reach 23.504 million tons, an increase of 1.7% over the previous year. Including this year's contributions, the cumulative output of commercial grain over 11 years can reach 21 billion kilograms, far exceeding the total output of the previous 20-plus years.

Anhui's agricultural contributions are substantial. However, agricultural development has been slow in recent years. How to strengthen this foundation of clothing and food, the source of the economy, and the key to stability, has become a major focus for these party and government cadres. Under the guidance of the central spirit, they have focused on this issue, adjusted their focus, and decided to strengthen rural grassroots, consolidate agricultural foundations, and stabilize, develop, and improve the "Household Contract Responsibility System" to build a solid foundation.

They have proven with countless examples that the "Household Contract Responsibility System" has unleashed rural productivity, but it is far from being fully released. Farmers eagerly hope for stability. Therefore, the Anhui Provincial Committee has decided on five unchanging policies: the policy of the household contract responsibility system with various forms of production led by family farming will not change; the policy of allowing and encouraging a part of the population to get rich first through honest labor, with the goal of common prosperity, will not change; the policy of encouraging and supporting the development of township enterprises and family sideline industries will not change; the policy of combining planned economy with market regulation for the main agricultural products purchasing and marketing will not change; the policy of actively developing diversified operations while ensuring grain production will not change.

They have also proven with countless examples that farmers are satisfied with the "Household Contract Responsibility System," but they are not content, eagerly hoping for its improvement and development, and the construction of a socialist large-scale agriculture and new rural areas to further unleash rural productivity.

### 抓好农村基层　夯实农业基础  安徽稳定完善“大包干”

    抓好农村基层　夯实农业基础
    安徽稳定完善“大包干”
    本报合肥电　记者张振国报道：安徽省委采取“以会代训，培养骨干”的办法，于11月24日至30日，把500多名县以上党政领导干部集中合肥，继续深入学习和贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神。7天之中，他们结合省情，想的、谈的最多的是一个“稳”字和一个“农”字。
    安徽是个农业大省，又是农业“大包干”的发祥地。10年改革，粮食产量有6年取得大丰收，由全国的第10位上升到第6位，累计调出商品原粮180多亿公斤。今年虽遇较大自然灾害，粮食总产预计仍可达到2350.4万吨，比上年增长1.7％。加上今年上交数，11年累计调出商品原粮可达210亿公斤，大大超过前20多年调出原粮的总和。
    安徽农业的奉献是大的。但近几年农业发展是缓慢的。如何抓好这个衣食之本、经济之源、安危所系的农业，就成为这些党政骨干绞尽脑汁的一大焦点。他们在吃准中央精神的前提下，对准焦点，调好焦距，决心在抓好农村基层，夯实农业基础上，稳定、发展、完善“大包干”上练好“内功”。
    他们用无数的事实证明：“大包干”释放了农村生产力，但远未释放完。农民热切希望稳定。为此，安徽省委决定5个不变：以家庭经营为主的多种形式的联产承包责任制的政策不变；以共同富裕为目标、允许和鼓励一部分人依靠诚实劳动先富起来的政策不变；鼓励和支持兴办乡镇企业和家庭工副业的政策不变；计划经济和市场调节相结合的主要农产品购销政策不变；在抓好粮食生产的前提下，积极发展多种经营的方针不变。
    他们还用无数事实证明：农民对“大包干”是满意的，但并不满足，热切希望完善和发展，建设好社会主义大农业、新农村，使农村的生产力再度释放出来。
