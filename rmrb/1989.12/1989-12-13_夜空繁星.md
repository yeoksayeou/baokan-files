	Su Lingyang, who joined the "Left League" in the 1930s and served as the female instructor at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Yan'an, passed away on October 29th this year, freeing herself from the torment of illness and bidding farewell to the world. That day, the weather was gloomy, with no sunlight, and a chilly wind blew intermittently.

	At this moment, a young female cadre dressed in a work uniform appears in my mind. That was my first impression of Comrade Su Lingyang in 1954. At that time, Ye Qin, who served as Secretary to Comrade Zhou Yang, introduced her, saying, "This is Principal Su." I thought to myself, who is Principal Su? Later, I found out that she was Zhou Yang's wife and the principal of the attached middle school of Beijing Normal University.

	Since her tenure at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Yan'an, especially since the founding of the nation, Comrade Su Lingyang has dedicated most of her time to the field of education. Many people are accustomed to calling her "Principal Su." During the 1950s and 1960s, she served as the deputy director of the Administrative Academy of the Ministry of Education and the deputy director and party secretary of the Beijing Arts Normal College. She poured all her energy into the educational cause, nurturing countless builders, for which she was elected as a representative of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. As the party secretary of the college, she patiently listened to the opinions of teachers and students. If someone encountered difficulties, especially students, she would always help them, although she was not wealthy herself. She was physically weak and had several fainting spells on the job, only to find out later that she had stomach bleeding. Shortly after the surgery, she returned to work with renewed vigor. She was a person who had no time to rest.

	It was such a dedicated cadre who, at the start of the Cultural Revolution, suffered inhuman torment. The atrocities committed by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique against her were appalling. She endured everything with her frail body and the noble character of a Communist Party member. In 1975, Comrade Su Lingyang regained a bit of freedom. Once, she comforted us, saying: "Everyone has grievances and pain. It's not a solution to always be in a state of turmoil. The current situation is not just about one person; the entire nation is undergoing a great test. As long as we are loyal to the party's nurturing and to the party and the people, we should not dwell on other things, nor should we feel aggrieved because of unfair treatment."

	She spoke of the retreat from Zhangjiakou during the War of Liberation, when her youngest son died in a car accident. As a mother, she was truly heartbroken. She said, "I used this logic to convince myself and stand up from my grief. Compared to the collective, the individual is a very small unit. Compared to the country, the world, and the universe, our personal troubles, difficulties, and even pain are nothing. We should learn to think positively and not be petty about personal grievances, as there is no end to that. We should learn to educate and comfort ourselves. If you often think about these things, I believe you will feel much better."

	Throughout Comrade Su Lingyang's more than half-century of tumultuous and arduous revolutionary career, whether under the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the 1930s, in the harsh environment of Yan'an, or during the so-called "unprecedented" days, she could correctly handle everything because she had the cause of the party, the motherland, and the people in her heart. After the torment of the Cultural Revolution, her health was poor, but she often went to the grassroots, visiting primary and secondary schools, advocating for everyone to care about the growth of the next generation. Even after her retirement, she still cared about whether the dilapidated buildings and the impoverished lives of teachers in remote areas had been solved and improved... She thought of many things, but none of them were for herself.

	Now, there are still some things she did not get to do before she hurriedly "left." Seeing Comrade Su Lingyang's gradually cooling, frail body, it seems as if she has embarked on a distant journey to pursue her late husband, Comrade Zhou Yang...

    夜空繁星

    三十年代就参加“左联”工作、在延安“鲁艺”担任过女生指导员的苏灵扬同志，于今年十月二十九日下午，摆脱了病魔的缠绕告别了人世。这天天气阴沉沉的，不见阳光，时时吹来阵阵冷风。
    此时，在我脑海里浮现出一位身穿劳动布上衣的年轻女干部的身影。那是1954年我初次见到苏灵扬同志的印象。当时担任周扬同志秘书的叶勤介绍说：“这是苏校长。”我心想苏校长是谁？后来知道她就是周扬夫人、师大女附中的校长。
    苏灵扬同志从延安鲁艺任职起、特别是开国以来，她的绝大部分时间是在教育工作岗位上，不少人习惯称她为“苏校长”。五十、六十年代期间，她担任过教育部教育行政学院的副院长，北京艺术师范学院的副院长、党委书记等职。她把全部心血倾注在教育事业上，培养了无数的建设人材，为此她曾当选为北京市人大代表。她作为学院的党委书记，耐心倾听师生意见，如果哪位同志遇上什么困难，尤其是学生，她都解囊相助，虽然她并不富有。她身体较弱，几次昏倒在岗位上，一检查才知道是胃出血，手术后不久，她又忘我的工作。她是一个没有时间休息的人。
    就是这样一位一心为工作的好干部，“文革”一开始，便受到了非人的折磨，林彪、江青反革命集团对她的摧残令人发指。她用自己柔弱的身体和共产党员的高尚品德承受了一切。1975年，苏灵扬同志有了一点自由。有一次，她劝慰我们说：“人人都有委屈、痛苦，老是处于一种激荡不安的状况也不是办法。现在的情况不是哪一个人的问题，全国人民都在经历着一场大考验。只要对得起党的培养，对党对人民忠诚到底，其它的就不要多想了，更不要因为受到不公平的待遇而感到委屈。”她讲到解放战争时期张家口撤退时，她的小儿子因翻车而亡，作为母亲，真是痛不欲生，她说：“我就是用这个道理来说服自己，使自己从悲痛中站立起来，个人与集体对比是个很小的单位，与国家比、与世界比、与宇宙比，我们个人的烦恼、困难乃至痛苦，又算得了什么？任何事情要想得开，不要斤斤计较个人的恩恩怨怨，那是计较不完的。要学会自己教育自己，宽慰自己。假若你经常想想这些，我想你心里就好受多了。”
    在苏灵扬同志半个多世纪的风风雨雨坎坷不平的革命生涯中，不论是在三十年代国民党反动派的白色恐怖之下，还是在延安的艰苦的环境中，或是所谓“史无前例”的日子里，她能正确对待一切，就因为她心中装着党的事业，装着祖国和人民。经过“文革”的折磨，她的身体很不好，但她还经常带病下基层，到中、小学校去巡视，呼吁大家关心下一代的成长，直到她离休后，还牵记着边远地区的中、小学的危房和教师的清贫生活是否得到解决和改善……她想到很多，但都不是为了个人。
    现在，有些事情她还没来得及做就匆匆地“走”了。看到苏灵扬同志的渐渐冷却的瘦弱的身躯，仿佛看到她为了追寻老伴周扬同志，已经踏上了一条遥远的路……
