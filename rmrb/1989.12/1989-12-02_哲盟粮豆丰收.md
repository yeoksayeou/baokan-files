    Known as the "granary of Inner Mongolia," Chifeng Prefecture this year overcame a severe drought to achieve its second record-breaking harvest in history: the total grain and bean production reached 2.04 billion kilograms, with an average of over 1,000 kilograms of grain per person for the 2 million farmers and herdsmen.

    Located on the northern frontier, Chifeng experiences droughts nine out of ten years. This summer and autumn, the region faced an unprecedented drought since the founding of the People's Republic, with a total rainfall of less than 70 millimeters over 50 days.

    The Chifeng Alliance Committee and the Alliance Administrative Office took a series of effective measures and launched extensive anti-drought and grain-saving activities among the masses, ultimately achieving a new harvest.
