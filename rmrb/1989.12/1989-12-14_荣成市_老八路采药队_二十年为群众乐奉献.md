The "Old Eight Route Army Herbal Medicine Team" of Rongcheng City, which gained fame nationwide in the 1960s, continues to uphold revolutionary traditions in the new situation. For 23 years, they have traveled over 10,000 kilometers, collected more than 10,000 kilograms of herbs, and provided medical services to more than 60,000 people, without asking for a single cent from the patients or the state. Their selfless dedication has been widely praised.

The "Old Eight Route Army Herbal Medicine Team" of Shandong Province's Rongcheng City was established in 1966. It is composed of retired military personnel and elderly cadres from the local area, with over 70 people having participated over the years. Currently, there are 14 members. Although the team members have changed over the years, their spirit of "willing to endure personal hardship for the happiness of others" has not wavered. They have been climbing mountains and wading through waters to dig for herbs and serve the people voluntarily.

Some people in society do not understand this: "You are all people with merits, why do you spend your days climbing mountains to dig for herbs?" Zhang Puyang, the 70-year-old team leader, says, "Since the day I joined the party, I have dedicated myself to the party and the people. If a communist party member becomes obsessed with money, then he is not worthy of being a party member." Before retiring, Zhang was the deputy director of Weishan County Hospital and had many years of medical experience. After retirement, some villages offered him an annual salary of 2,000 yuan to be their doctor, but he declined and has been working in the herbal medicine team for 20 years.

The members of the herbal medicine team are all over 50 years old, and some are even 78. Despite their age and health issues, they have not been deterred from climbing mountains to dig for herbs. Autumn is the golden season for digging herbs. They bring their luggage, carry dry rations, and set up camp in the mountains tens of miles away, staying for seven or eight days. When hungry, they eat cold dry rations; when thirsty, they drink mountain spring water. At night, they crowd into grass huts, light candles, and study medical knowledge. With this spirit of revolutionary optimism, they have climbed every mountain in Rongcheng, Wendi, and Weihai, collecting herbs that not only they use but also provide to local pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, making up for the shortage of some Chinese herbs in the area. Retired military officer Yang Dianchen once injured two vertebrae on duty and had to wear a "steel corset." When digging herbs, he couldn't bend down, so he knelt to work. Often, he was so tired that he couldn't climb onto the kang (traditional Chinese bed) at home, but the next day he would still go up the mountain.

The members of the "Old Eight Route Army Herbal Medicine Team" have brought joy to countless families with their hard work. Over the years, the team has received more than a thousand letters of thanks. A farmer from Shanghai's suburbs, Cai Guopei, wrote, "I have suffered from rheumatism for many years and spent a lot of money without getting better. It was the herbs you sent that cured my disease, and now I can work again. You are my unseen relatives."

    荣成市“老八路采药队”二十年为群众乐奉献
    本报讯　60年代就闻名全国的荣成市“老八路采药队”，在新形势下继续发扬革命优良传统，23年如一日，累计行程1万多公里，采药1万多公斤，为群众送药、看病6万多人次，没向病人和国家要一分钱的报酬。他们这种忘我奉献精神受到了普遍称赞。
    山东省荣成市“老八路采药队”成立于1966年，由驻地一些离退休军人和市老干部组成，先后有70多人参加，目前共有14人。“老八路采药队”的人换了一茬又一茬，可他们那种
  “甘用一人苦，换来万人乐”的精神没有丢，常年爬山涉水，挖药不止，义务为人民群众服务。
    对此，社会上有些人不理解：你们都是有功的人，成天爬山采药图个啥？今年70岁的采药队队长张普阳说：“从入党那天起，我就把自己交给了党和人民，一个共产党员如果一头钻进了‘钱眼里’，那他不配做一个党员。”张队长离休前是微山县医院副院长，有多年的医疗工作经验，退休后，有的村曾以每年2000元的薪水请他做医生，他不去，心甘情愿地在采药队工作了20年。
    采药队的同志年龄大的78岁，小的也50多岁了，并且大都体弱多病，可这并没能阻止他们上山采药。秋季是采药的黄金季节，他们带着行李，背上干粮，到几十里外的大山“安营扎寨”，一住就是七八天，饿了啃口凉干粮，渴了喝几口山泉水，晚上挤在草棚里，点起蜡烛，学习医药知识。他们就是以这种不怕困难，以苦为荣的革命乐观主义精神，爬遍了荣成、文登、威海等市的大小山头，采集的草药除自己用外，还提供给当地药材公司、医院等部门，弥补了当地一些中草药的不足。军队退休干部杨殿臣，曾因公损伤了两节脊椎骨，医生给他穿上了“钢背心”，刨药时不能弯腰就跪着干，经常累得回家爬不上炕，第二天照样上山。
    “老八路采药队”的同志用自己的辛劳，换来了万家欢乐。几年来，“老八路采药队”收到了上千封感谢信。上海市郊农民蔡国培来信说：“我患风湿病多年，花了不少钱也没治好，是你们寄来的药把我的病治好了，我已能参加劳动，你们是我没见面的亲人。”
