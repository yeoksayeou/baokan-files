N'Djamena is the capital of Chad, located along the Chari River in the heart of Central Africa. The local name N'Djamena means "place of rest." It is said that in the past, camel caravans crossing the Sahara Desert and Muslim pilgrims heading to Mecca would often stop here to rest before continuing their journey.

Before Chad's independence, N'Djamena was known as Fort-Lamy, named after a French colonial officer. During World War II, it served as a U.S. airbase. Over the past twenty years, the city has frequently been ravaged by war. Even today, as one walks through the city, one can still see buildings riddled with bullet holes and crumbling walls.

Chad faces significant transportation challenges, energy shortages, and economic difficulties. More than twenty years of war have left deep scars on the hearts of the Chadian people. Many locals have expressed that Chad cannot endure another war and hope that this historical tragedy will end here. This reflects the Chadian people's desire for national stability and peace.

The Chadian leadership, led by President Habré, recognizes the importance of quickly achieving peace, stability, unity, good neighborly relations, and economic recovery for the country's long-term stability. Despite the challenges of post-war reconstruction, they are determined to overcome difficulties and work systematically to heal the wounds of war.

After the smoke of war has cleared, N'Djamena has regained its former peace and tranquility and is once again regaining its vitality and charm. Although there are no skyscrapers and the store windows are not filled with colorful goods, people dress neatly, and social order is good. The central market is bustling with various daily necessities. In the eastern part of the city, there are densely packed mud-brick houses, narrow streets, and an ancient, dignified cityscape. The western part is a villa district with modern small houses, beautiful streets, and lush greenery. In N'Djamena, there are both southern Saras and northerners with varying degrees of Arab blood or Arab influence. Despite past conflicts and disputes between different tribes, they are all hardworking and simple, now working together, interdependent, and treating each other equally, jointly rebuilding and developing N'Djamena.

Walking through N'Djamena, one can see streets being paved, drains being cleared, old garbage being cleaned up, and major buildings being repaired. In the eastern part of the city, Chinese workers are helping to expand the Friendship Stadium. In the northwestern suburbs, on the construction site of the People's Palace, which is being built with Chinese aid, Chinese engineering and technical personnel are working with local workers to prepare for construction, with the sound of machinery and vehicle engines roaring...

N'Djamena is recovering and being rebuilt, and urban beautification is also underway. It is hoped that in the not-too-distant future, the war-torn N'Djamena will present itself to the world in a new and vibrant appearance!

    恩贾梅纳纪行
    春来　宝华
    恩贾梅纳是乍得的首都，地处中非内陆的沙里河畔。恩贾梅纳当地语的含义是
  “休息之地”。据说昔日在撒哈拉大沙漠里行走的骆驼商队和赴麦加朝圣的伊斯兰教徒，往往要在这里稍事休息，再继续赶路。
    乍得独立之前，恩贾梅纳被称作拉密堡，拉密是当年法国殖民者一个指挥官的名字，“堡”者，“城堡”之谓也。二次大战时，这里曾经是美国的一个空军基地。近二十多年来，这座城市仍然频遭战乱洗劫。时至今日，漫步在这座城市里，人们依然可以看到弹痕累累的建筑物和残垣断壁。
    乍得交通不便，能源匮乏，经济有不少困难。二十多年的战乱，在乍得人民的心灵上留下了不可磨灭的创伤。许多当地居民都表示，乍得再也经不起战乱了，但愿历史悲剧到此为止。这表达了乍得人民希望国家从乱到治的心愿和对和平安定的渴求。
    以哈布雷总统为首的乍得领导人意识到迅速实现和平、安定团结、睦邻友好、恢复发展生产对国家的长治久安至关重要。尽管战后百废待举，他们仍以坚定的决心和毅力，克服重重困难，正在有计划有步骤为医治战争创伤而奋斗。
      硝烟散尽之后的恩贾梅纳已恢复往日的和平宁静，并正在重新焕发出活力和风采。这里虽然没有高楼大厦，商店橱窗里也没有五光十色的商品，但人们衣着整洁，社会秩序良好。中央大市场熙熙攘攘，各式各色的生活用品应有尽有。在市区东部，泥坯砌成的简易房舍密集，街道狭小，市容古朴端庄。城西则为别墅区，都是现代化小洋房，街景华美，花木繁茂。在恩贾梅纳既居住着南方的萨拉人，也居住着或多或少有阿拉伯血统或阿拉伯化的北方人。尽管不同部族间曾经发生矛盾和冲突，但他们都勤劳朴实，现正在共事合作、相互依存、平等相处，一道为恩贾梅纳的重建和发展而辛勤劳动着。
    漫步在恩贾梅纳，人们会看到，街道在平整，下水道在疏浚，陈年垃圾在清理，主要街道建筑物在修葺。在城东，中国人正在帮助扩建协和体育场；在西北郊中国援建的人民宫工地上，中国工程技术人员与当地工人正在一道加紧做施工前的准备工作，机器和汽车马达声隆隆作响……
    恩贾梅纳正在恢复，正在重建，城市美化也在同时进行，但愿在不久的将来，饱经沧桑的恩贾梅纳将以崭新的姿态出现在人们眼前！
