	Editor's Note: The first batch of senior technicians from among Chinese workers has been selected. Recently, a certificate awarding ceremony was held in the Great Hall of the People. This is an affirmation of the role of Chinese technical workers and an encouragement to the broad masses of workers. These senior technicians are all skilled craftsmen and innovation experts in various industries. The one introduced here is one of them.

	He is a typical old worker, with an ordinary name, a common appearance, and a plain job. However, he is an outstanding "innovation enthusiast," producing results every year, with ingenious designs that often make engineers marvel.

	He is Zhao Agou, a lathe operator, Communist Party member, Shanghai labor model, and one of the first batch of national senior technicians at the Shanghai Xinjiang Machinery Factory under the Aerospace Industry Department.

	Pursuit of Creation – A Passion for Innovation

	Master Zhao began his apprenticeship in a pharmacy in his hometown in 1950 and became a lathe operator in a factory in 1956. He is one of the first generation of workers nurtured by New China. As early as the 1960s and 1970s, he had already carried out more than 20 innovations in military product production, significantly increasing efficiency. In the 1980s, his goals became even higher. During the initial production of the Shanghai-brand washing machine, production was relatively backward. One day, a leader from the Aerospace Department came to inspect the work and saw workers swinging wooden mallets all day. He said with heartache, "Modern products with workshop-style production must be changed." Master Zhao took the words to heart and soon designed a semi-automatic flanging machine, increasing efficiency by 10 times. He then improved the design and created an automatic flanging machine. Later, based on production needs, he carried out several supporting innovations. From 1984 to 1988, he designed 9 specialized equipment for the production of washing machine inner and outer shells, forming a series that are mutually compatible, creating an annual economic benefit of 800,000 yuan for the factory. Workers affectionately call these machines "Dog Number One," "Dog Number Two," and so on.

	Pursuit of Knowledge – Versatility

	Master Zhao has been a lathe operator for over 30 years and is naturally skilled in lathe work. He is also quite proficient in milling, planing, and fitting. In his youth, he studied a year of engineering courses at the factory's evening school, mastering mechanical principles and other technical theories, and learning design and drafting. Later, he never stopped self-study. In addition to machine processing, he also has some understanding of electrical, electronic, hydraulic, and pneumatic technologies. In his spare time, he often helps colleagues repair televisions, improving his electrical skills.

	The washing machine inner drum bottom flanging machine is a large piece of equipment with high technical difficulty, integrating mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic technologies. The design scheme took a relatively long time. Generally, flanging machines use two rollers to flange circular or kidney-shaped edges. Initially, he also used two rollers for the experiment, but failed. After two weeks of deep thought, he suddenly had an inspiration during a meal, drawing inspiration from a principle he had seen in a previous piece of equipment, coming up with a plan to use three rollers, solving the technical problem of flanging irregular surfaces. This innovation is a domestic first, saving half of the labor force, increasing productivity by 15 times, reducing costs, and creating an annual economic benefit of 270,000 yuan.

	Pursuit of Value – Dedication

	Time passes, and production develops. The innovations he makes are becoming more and more, and Master Zhao's honors are coming one after another: in 1988, he was named an advanced worker and model of the factory; he was awarded three third-class merits; an active member and innovation expert of the Shanghai Aerospace Bureau's Association for Science and Technology; an advanced individual of the Shanghai Association for Science and Technology; a labor model of Shanghai; and an outstanding Communist Party member of the Shanghai Aerospace Bureau. His fame grew, and his influence became significant. In late 1987, a township enterprise in Huangyan, Zhejiang, offered him a salary double or more than his current income to "invite" him, but he remained steadfast. Some people, seeing that they couldn't poach him, tried every means to bribe him with "goodwill fees" for his innovation drawings, all of which were rejected by him.

	In early 1989, he happily accepted the factory director's appointment to become the leader of the factory's technical reform breakthrough team, responsible for overcoming some technical difficulties in the factory and designing specialized production equipment for the new generation of technology-intensive car air-conditioning products for Xinjiang Factory.

	There are still many things he wants to do. However, it can perhaps be said that he is always and forever doing one thing, which is: to pursue relentlessly and dedicate unceasingly.

    “革新迷”的追求
    ——记上海新江机器厂高级技师赵阿狗
    杭天
    编者按　我国首批从工人中评出来的高级技师已经诞生，最近在人民大会堂举行了颁证大会。这是对我国技术工人作用的肯定，也是对广大工人的鼓舞。这些高级技师都是各行各业的能工巧匠，革新能手。这里介绍的，就是他们中间的一个。
    他是一位典型的老工人，普通的名字，一般的长相，平凡的工作。然而，他却是一位出色的“革新迷”，年年出成果，巧妙的设计，常常使工程师叹服。
    他，就是航空航天工业部上海新江机器厂车工、共产党员、上海市劳模、全国首批高级技师赵阿狗同志。
    追求创造——一味革新
    阿狗师傅1950年开始在家乡的一家药店当学徒，1956年进厂当车工，是新中国培养的第一代工人。早在六七十年代，他就在军品生产中搞过20多项革新，使工效成倍地提高。到了80年代，他追求的目标更高了。上海牌洗衣机上马初期，生产比较落后。有一天，航天部领导来厂视察工作，看到工人整天挥动木榔头，十分心疼地说：“现代化的产品，作坊式的生产，非改不可。”赵师傅听进耳里，记在心里，不久便设计了一台半自动翻边机，提高工效10倍。接着又改进设计，搞出了自动翻边机。以后，从生产需要出发，他又搞了一些配套的革新。从1984年至1988年，他为洗衣机内胆、外壳生产革新、设计的9台专用设备自成系列，相互配套，累计每年可为工厂创经济效益80万元。工人们把这些亲切地称之为“狗字一号”，“狗字二号”……
    追求知识——一专多能
    赵师傅做了30余年的车工，精于车削自不必说。对于铣、刨、钳等工种也颇熟练。他年青时曾在厂业余学校学习过一年工科大学的课程，掌握了机械原理等技术理论，学会了设计、制图；以后又从未间断过自学，除机加工外，对电工、电子、液压、气动等方面的技术，也有所了解。空闲时，他还常常帮同事装修电视机，提高电工本领。
    洗衣机内胆筒底咬边机是一台技术难度很高的大型设备，综合运用了机、电、液压、气动技术，方案设计花的时间比较长。一般的咬边机都是咬圆形或腰子形边，采用两个滚轮。开始他也用两个滚轮做试验，失败了。足足经过了两个星期，苦思冥想，终于在一天吃饭的时候，灵感大发，从以前看到过的一台设备的某个原理中得到启迪，想出了用三只滚轮的方案，解决了不规则型面咬边的技术难题。这项革新属国内首创，使劳动力节约一半，生产率提高15倍，成本下降，年创经济效益27万元。
    追求价值——一心奉献
    岁月在流逝，生产在发展。他搞的革新设备越来越多，赵阿狗的荣誉接踵而来：1988年评为厂先进职工、先进标兵；3次记三等功；上海航天局技协积极分子，技革能手；上海市技协先进个人；上海市劳动模范；上海航天局优秀共产党员。名气响了，影响大了，赵师傅的“身价”也高了。1987年底，浙江黄岩有一家乡镇企业，提出以多于他现在收入一二倍的高薪“请”他，他毫不动摇。一些人见无法把人挖过去，就千方百计、七转八弯，想以“好处费”收买他的革新图纸，也都被他一一拒绝了。
    1989年初，他愉快地接受了厂长的聘任，担任全厂技术改革攻关组组长，负责攻克厂里定下的一些技术难关，并为新江厂新一代技术密集型的车用空调产品设计专用生产设备。
    他要做的事情还有许多许多。但是，也许可以说，他只是永远地始终如一地做着一件事，这就是：执著地追求，不停地奉献。
