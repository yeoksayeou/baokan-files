    邓小平等在百色起义前夕创办右江日报走过六十年战斗历程
    新华社南宁12月9日电  （记者邓国添）伴随着百色起义枪声诞生的《右江日报》，与举世闻名的百色起义一起，迎来了60岁生日。
    《右江日报》是邓小平、张云逸等同志1929年12月11日领导的百色起义前夕在百色创刊的，百色起义后是中国工农红军第七军的机关报。邓小平、张云逸等同志为创办《右江日报》付出过心血。
    60年来，《右江日报》走过的战斗历程光辉而坎坷。它为红七军的发展壮大，为右江革命根据地的建设，作出了应有的贡献；它为中国人民解放军解放桂西南吹起了号角；全国解放后，它作为中共百色地委的机关报，为百色地区的社会主义革命和建设充当了党的喉舌；它是祖国西南边疆一张具有浓郁地方特色和民族特色的报纸，现在百色地区平均每70人就有一份《右江日报》，成为300万人民不可缺少的精神食粮。
