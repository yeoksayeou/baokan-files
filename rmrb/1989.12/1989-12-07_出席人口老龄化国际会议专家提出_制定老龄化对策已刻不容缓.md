The International Conference on Population Aging Policy and Prospects opened this morning in Beijing. Wang Ping and Wang Shoudao, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, and Vice Chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) Yan Jizi and Lei Jieqiong attended the conference at the invitation. Over 50 representatives and experts from eight countries and regions participated in the conference.

This four-day conference will focus on discussing the impact of population aging on society and the economy; income, health, and employment; the role of families and communities in caring for the elderly; and health and medical services.

Experts attending the conference believe that formulating corresponding strategies for population aging is an urgent task. Since 1985, with the assistance of the United Nations Population Fund, Chinese and Japanese experts have conducted scientific predictions on China's population development trends and comparative studies on population policies, economics and labor force, pensions and employment, families and welfare, and medical and health care, with the aim of formulating policies. To integrate the research results, a Sino-Japanese Expert Conference on Aging was held in Japan in 1988, which adopted a recommendation to the Chinese government. This conference is held on the basis of the five-year comparative study by the two countries' experts, combined with the new research results in recent years, to further exchange experiences and expand international influence.

Wang Zhaohua, Chairman of the National Committee on Aging in China, said in his opening remarks that we recently established the strategic goal of China's aging work, that is, from now until the end of the century, we will make all preparations to strive to create an environment and conditions suitable for population aging, and welcome the arrival of population aging. This strategic goal, based on the development trend of China's population, is the achievement of the Institute of Aging Science in China, which also includes the results of the Sino-Japanese comparative study.

Minister of Civil Affairs Cui Naiwu said at the conference that China has over 91 million people aged 60 and above. China is a country with a large elderly population, and the Chinese government attaches great importance to and cares about aging work. Currently, our research work has just begun, and many issues need to be deepened. To correctly solve the problems brought by China's population aging, we need to continuously deepen the survey and research work, so that we can formulate a practical, scientific, and comprehensive policy and guideline for aging work, and find an appropriate way to solve China's aging problems.

Representatives from the United Nations Population Fund in Beijing, Laquian, Abadas Samad from the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and renowned Japanese demographer Tsuneo Kuroda also spoke at the conference.

    出席人口老龄化国际会议专家提出
    制定老龄化对策已刻不容缓
    新华社北京12月6日电　人口老龄化政策与前景国际会议今天上午在北京开幕。
    中顾委常委王平、王首道，全国人大常委会副委员长严济慈、雷洁琼等，应邀出席了会议。来自世界8个国家和地区的50多名代表、专家学者参加了会议。
    这次为期4天的会议将着重讨论人口老龄化对社会、经济的影响；收入保健与就业；家庭和社区服务在赡养老人方面的作用；保健和医疗服务等问题。
    出席会议的专家们认为，及时制定人口老龄化相应的对策，是当前紧迫的课题。从1985年以来，在联合国人口基金的援助下，中日双方专家对中国人口发展趋势，进行了科学的预测；并就人口政策、经济与劳动力、年金与就业、家庭与福利、医疗保健等专题进行了以制定政策为目的的对比研究。为了综合研究成果，1988年在日本召开了中日老龄问题专家会议，通过了给中国政府的建议书。这次会议是两国专家在5年对比研究的基础上，结合近年来研究的新成果，为进一步交流经验，扩大国际影响而召开的。
    中国老龄问题全国委员会主任王照华在致开幕词中说，前不久我们确立了中国老龄工作的战略目标，即从现在起到本世纪末，我们要做好一切准备，努力创造一个适应人口老龄化的环境和条件，迎接人口老龄化的到来。依据中国人口发展趋势提出的这个战略目标，是中国老龄科学研究所取得的成就，其中也包含了中日两国对比研究取得的成果。
    民政部长崔乃夫在会上讲话说，中国60岁以上的老年人已达9100多万。中国是个老龄人口大国，中国政府很重视和关心老龄工作。目前，我们的研究工作还刚刚起步，许多问题有待深化。为了正确地解决中国人口老龄化带来的问题，需要把调查研究工作不断引向深入，只有这样才能制定出符合实际的、科学的、完备的老龄工作方针和政策，找出解决中国老龄问题的恰当途径。
    联合国人口基金驻北京代表拉奎安、亚太经社理事会阿巴达斯·萨玛德、日本著名人口学教授黑田俊夫也在会上讲了话。
