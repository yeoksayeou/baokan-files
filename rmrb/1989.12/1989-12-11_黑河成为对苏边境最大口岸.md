    Heihe in Heilongjiang Province has become the largest port for Sino-Soviet border trade. In the first 11 months of this year, the number of vehicles and ships entering and exiting through this port reached 20,866, with over 80,000 people entering and exiting, and a trade volume of 183,000 tons. These figures are 9 times, 8 times, and 5 times higher than the same period last year, respectively.

    Heihe, a border city in northern China, faces Blagoveshchensk across the river in the Soviet Union. The two ports are only 1.5 kilometers apart. The trade port between Heihe and Blagoveshchensk officially opened in September 1987.
