The KMT Central Standing Committee approved a personnel shuffle on December 27. Guan Zhong will exclusively serve as the deputy secretary-general of the KMT Central Committee and will no longer concurrently hold the position of director of the KMT Central Committee's Organizational Work Committee.

The report stated that the personnel adjustments include: Xiao Wanchang, vice chairman of the "Executive Yuan Economic Construction Committee," will take over as the director of the KMT Central Committee's Organizational Work Committee; Zhang Xiaoyan, deputy minister of the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," will assume the role of director of the KMT Central Committee's Overseas Work Committee; Zheng Xionghong will take over as the director of the KMT Central Committee's Mainland Work Committee; Wang Shuqin will serve as the chairman of the KMT Taiwan Province Party Committee; Wu Dunyi will take over as the chairman of the KMT Taipei City Party Committee; Huang Jingfeng will take over as the chairman of the KMT Kaohsiung City Party Committee.

According to the report, the original director of the KMT Mainland Work Committee, Xiao Changle, the original chairman of the KMT Taiwan Province Party Committee, Ma Zhenfang, and the original chairman of the KMT Kaohsiung City Party Committee, Cai Zhongxiong, have resigned.
