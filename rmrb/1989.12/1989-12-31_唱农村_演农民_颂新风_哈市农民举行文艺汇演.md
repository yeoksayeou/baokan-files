After being neglected for a decade, the farmers' art performance has once again taken the stage in Harbin, accompanied by the joyous sound of drums and gongs.

Over a hundred farmer performers from nine districts and two counties (cities) in Harbin presented 36 excellent programs, including music, dance, instrumental music, folk art, short plays, and local opera Errenzhuan, during a two-day art performance. Local and district-level cadres attending the Harbin municipal rural work conference, along with suburban farmers, happily watched the performance. The audience frequently applauded and laughed, creating a lively atmosphere. The performers, who wrote and acted in their own shows, sang about the people around them and performed stories from their own lives. They used real people and real events to sing the praises of the new changes brought to the countryside by reform and opening up, expressing the farmers' new spirit of loving the Party and socialism.
