People's Daily, Jinan. People's Daily reporter Jia Jianzhou and Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Youdao report: Shandong Province is implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, summing up experiences and lessons in an objective manner, and timely adjusting its economic development strategy. The province is focusing its efforts on strengthening basic industries and improving economic efficiency.

Shandong is a province rich in resources. Over the past 40 years, especially in the last 10 years, the province has made significant economic progress. However, in recent years, there has been a tendency to seek quick results in economic construction: the scale of infrastructure construction has been too large, the development of processing industries has been too rapid, exacerbating structural contradictions in the economy; financial, energy, and raw material shortages have led to the idling of hundreds of billions of yuan in fixed assets in industrial enterprises at the county and township levels and above; the agricultural foundation is weak, and coupled with consecutive years of drought, grain, cotton, and oil production have shown signs of stagnation; the rapid growth of processing industries and consumer-oriented accumulation investments has affected the long-term development of the economy.

Recently, when accepting an interview from reporters, Provincial Party Secretary Jiang Chunyun said, "While fully affirming the achievements and the mainstream, we must also objectively expose contradictions and clarify responsibilities at all levels. Especially, leading cadres at all levels must prevent and overcome the tendency to underestimate difficulties. The attitude that considers economic rectification to be unrelated to oneself, or even to delay it if possible, is wrong."

To this end, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have made controlling social total demand a top priority in economic rectification. Next year, the province's total fixed asset investment will be controlled at 20 billion yuan (a reduction of 7 billion yuan from 1988), the growth of consumption funds will be lower than the growth of national income and labor productivity, and the credit scale will be controlled within the national plan. New general processing industry projects will not be approved in principle, and new projects for buildings and halls will not be started. Other projects will be subject to dual control over investment scale and construction scale in the current year. Investment by rural collectives will also be included in the planned special management at different levels, and unauthorized construction will not be allowed. In the total fixed asset investment, the proportion of technical transformation investment will not be reduced, and the proportion of agricultural, energy, transportation, and raw material construction investment will be increased.

Efforts will be made to overcome the scattered use of financial and material resources, and to concentrate forces on ensuring key construction projects. Starting next year, the province will allocate a portion of funds from the extra-budgetary funds and budget adjustment funds as local key construction funds; another 10% will be saved from the administrative and public welfare expenses of provincial departments and used for agriculture and supporting industries; preferential policies will be implemented for 670 large and medium-sized enterprises in the province.

Agriculture is the foundation of the entire economy. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to focus on two major tasks: first, to overcome the biggest constraint on agriculture by improving water conservancy. Second, to tap the greatest potential for increased production by promoting "agricultural technology." Efforts will be made to develop new resources such as the Yellow River Delta, shallow sea tidal flats, and low-yielding fields, while also increasing the yield of grain, cotton, and oil.

### 调整经济发展战略  控制社会总需求  山东强化基础产业

    调整经济发展战略  控制社会总需求
    山东强化基础产业
    本报济南电　本报记者贾建舟、中央人民广播电台记者李有道报道：山东省贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，实事求是地总结经验教训，及时调整经济发展战略，把劲用在加强基础产业、提高经济效益上来。
    山东是一个资源比较丰富的省份。经过40年特别是最近10年的建设，经济取得长足发展。但是，近几年，山东在经济建设上也有急于求成的倾向：基建摊子铺得过大，加工工业发展过快，加剧了经济结构的矛盾；资金、能源、原材料紧张，致使全省乡、镇以上工业企业上百亿元的固定资产处于闲置半闲置的状态；农业基础脆弱，加之连年干旱，粮棉油生产出现了徘徊现象；加工工业和消费性积累投资增长过猛，影响了经济发展的后劲。
    省委书记姜春云日前在接受记者采访时说，在充分肯定成绩、主流的同时，也要实事求是地揭露矛盾，层层交底。特别是各级领导同志一定要防止和克服对困难估计不足的倾向，那种认为治理整顿与己无关、甚至能拖则拖的态度，是错误的。
    为此，山东省委、省政府把坚决控制社会总需求作为治理整顿的首要任务。明年全省地方全社会固定资产投资规模控制在200亿元以下（比1988年减少70亿元），消费基金增长低于国民收入和劳动生产率的增长，信贷规模控制在国家下达的计划以内。新的一般的加工工业项目原则上一个不批，新的楼堂馆所项目一个不上，对其他项目实行当年投资规模和在建规模双重指标控制制度，对乡村集体投资也分级纳入计划专项管理，不准突破规模和无证建设。在全部固定资产投资中，保持技改投资所占的比例不降低，农业、能源、交通、原材料基建投资的比例有增加。
    克服财力物力过于分散的状况，集中力量确保重点建设项目。全省明年开始，从预算外资金和预算调节基金中集中一部分资金，作为地方重点建设基金；再从省直行政、事业费中压缩10％用于农业和支农工业；对全省670个大中型企业实行倾斜政策。
    农业稳则全局稳。省委、省政府决定突出抓好两件大事：一是克服制约农业的最大因素，把水利搞上去。二是挖掘最大的增产潜力，把“科技兴农”搞上去。搞好黄河三角洲、浅海滩涂以及中低产田等新资源的开发，同时，提高粮、棉、油单产。
