The selfless dedication of Communist Party members in Tianjin is truly inspiring. During a time when bourgeois liberalization is rampant and the decadent idea of "everything for money" is prevalent, Party members in Tianjin go where it is hard and set an example for the masses. Their spirit of selfless dedication will never be outdated.

Advocating selfless dedication first requires that we make it a fundamental requirement for Party members. Selfless dedication is the essence of a Communist. The nature of the Party dictates that only those who are willing to sacrifice and dedicate themselves can become Party members. The Party's appeal and cohesion lie in this very spirit. The people deepen their understanding of the Party through countless Party members like Liu Hulan, Zhang Zedong, Jiao Yulu, and Lei Feng. In many dire situations, it is the exemplary role of these Party members that keeps the people steadfastly following the Party. In recent times, in some places, the leading role of the Party has been weakened, and some people do not know what a Party member should be like in the new era, while others simply go with the flow and engage in selfish and corrupt activities, seriously damaging the Party's reputation among the people. Both positive and negative examples show that whenever the exemplary role and spirit of selfless dedication of Party members are promoted, the Party's appeal and cohesion are strong, and the cause led by the Party develops rapidly. Whenever this spirit is weakened, the Party's work will face more difficulties and setbacks. Therefore, Party-building work must never relax its requirements and education for Party members' selfless dedication.

Advocating selfless dedication requires mobilizing and educating the entire population to understand that a society can only develop and progress when the spirit of selfless dedication is promoted. In our society where the people are the masters, talking about dedication first refers to the broad masses of Party members. Dedication is the responsibility and honor of Party members. It is also the duty, responsibility, and honor of citizens. The bourgeois liberalization "elites" incite people to "deny all existing concepts," glorify the decadent idea of "everything for money," and devalue the spirit of selfless dedication that even feudal and capitalist societies dare not denounce. They create confusion in values to make people abandon the communist value system and pull the wheel of history backward. They will continue to do so in the future. When we advocate selfless dedication, we must not forget these negative examples.

Advocating selfless dedication is particularly important at the present time. The entire national economy is facing a situation of rectification and deepening reform, and the central government has called for a few years of austerity. In this context, demonstrating the spirit of mastery and advocating the spirit of selfless dedication is more important than ever.

As long as a "dedication is glorious" social atmosphere is formed, no difficulty can stop us. This has been proven by the practice in Tianjin. Any place or unit that, like the Tianjin Municipal Committee, genuinely educates Party members and the masses on selfless dedication, actively commends advanced individuals who embody this spirit, especially makes selfless dedication a major responsibility of Party members and an important criterion for evaluating Party members, and expels unqualified Party members, will definitely see selfless dedication become a prevailing trend and achieve a situation like that in Tianjin.

    提倡无私奉献
    本报评论员
    天津市共产党员无私奉献的事迹可歌可泣。在资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥、“一切向钱看”等腐朽没落观念大有市场的时候，天津市的共产党员们哪里艰苦哪里去，他们的先锋模范作用感动和带动了广大群众，从他们身上，人们不但看到了党员们在“全心全意为人民服务”，而且看到了无私奉献的精神永远不会过时。
    提倡无私奉献，首先要把无私奉献作为对党员的基本要求。无私奉献是共产党人的本色。党的性质决定只有甘愿吃亏、奉献的人才能成为党员。党的感召力和凝聚力也正在于此。人民群众是从千千万万个刘胡兰、张思德、焦裕禄、雷锋这样的党员身上不断加深对党的认识的。在许多险恶形势下，是这些党员的先锋模范作用使群众矢志不移地跟党走。前一时期在某些地方由于党的领导作用被淡化，有的不清楚新时期党员应是什么样子，有的干脆随波逐流干起为富不仁、以权谋私的事情，才严重损害了党在人民群众中的威望。正反两方面的事实都说明，什么时候党员的先锋模范作用和无私奉献精神得到发扬，党的感召力和凝聚力就强，党领导的事业就发展得快；什么时候这种精神淡化了，党的工作就会增加困难，出现挫折。因此，党建工作一时一刻也不能放松对党员无私奉献的要求和教育。
    提倡无私奉献，需要动员和教育全体人民都懂得，一个社会只有无私奉献精神得到发扬光大，这个社会才能发展，才能进步。在我们这个人民当家作主的社会里，讲奉献，首先是指广大党员说的。奉献是党员的责任与光荣。同时也是公民的义务、责任与光荣。资产阶级自由化的“精英”们鼓动人们“否定一切现存观念”，美化腐朽没落的“一切向钱看”，把封建社会、资本主义社会也不敢不赞赏的无私奉献贬得一钱不值。他们在价值观上制造混乱，是为了让人们抛弃共产主义的价值观，跟着他们把历史车轮往回拉。他们今后还会这么干的。我们提倡无私奉献，不可忘了这些反面教员。
    提倡无私奉献，在当前尤显重要。整个国民经济正面临着治理整顿和深化改革的形势，中央号召过几年紧日子。在这种情况下发挥主人翁精神，提倡无私奉献精神就显得比以往任何时候都更为重要了。
    只要形成了“奉献光荣”的社会风尚，什么困难也难不住我们。这一点已为天津市的实践所证明。任何地方、任何单位如果都像天津市委那样切切实实地对党员和群众进行无私奉献的教育，大力表彰无私奉献的先进人物，特别是把无私奉献作为党员的主要责任和评议党员的重要内容，把不合格的党员淘汰出去，无私奉献就一定蔚然成风，就一定会出现像天津市那样的喜人局面。
