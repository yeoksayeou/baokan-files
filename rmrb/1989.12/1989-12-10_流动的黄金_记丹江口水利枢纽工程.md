The Han River, stretching over 3,000 miles, flows ceaselessly. People constructed a dam 30 stories high and twice the length of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge at the confluence of the Han and Dan Rivers. The river remains the same, the water is still abundant, but the river's character has changed dramatically, and the value of the water has increased a hundredfold.

The dam stands tall, now in its prime. On the water side, a vast artificial sea stretches for a thousand miles, with a storage capacity of 20 billion cubic meters, making it the largest reservoir in China. On the land side, a hydroelectric power station with 6 units and a total capacity of 900,000 kilowatts lies at the foot of the dam, generating an average of 3.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, making it one of the largest hydroelectric power stations in China.

Since the first unit began generating electricity in 1968, 20 years have passed. The comprehensive benefits of the Danjiangkou Hydropower Project have accumulated to 11 billion yuan, more than 13 times the investment in the project. Among China's current large-scale water conservancy projects, it ranks first in terms of functionality and benefits.

In Danjiangkou, the flowing water is not just clear water, but also gold!

**A Star Among Stars**

First, let's talk about the rise of the star that is the Danjiangkou Hydropower Project. In 1958, when construction began, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued an order, and 100,000 people worked day and night to build a 431-kilometer-long railway from Wuhan to Shiyan to Danjiangkou. Before the project, Danjiangkou was just a small village in the old county of Jianli. After the project was completed and the water was stored, the county seat was submerged, and the people moved to Danjiangkou, making it a city that never sleeps in northwestern Hubei – Danjiangkou City.

Shiyan used to have only one thermal power plant, generating 50 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. After the electricity from Danjiangkou was introduced to Shiyan, the city quickly became one of the key industrial cities in the country, with a complete range of industries including textiles, electronics, machinery, and chemicals. Today, the city's daily industrial output is even higher than the total industrial output of the year before liberation. Shiyan, known as a "star city," has obviously benefited from Danjiangkou.

In the vast expanse of northwestern Hubei and southwestern Henan, there are not just Danjiangkou City and Shiyan City that have benefited. With electricity, industry thrives, and the entire economy flourishes. The pride of Hubei people, the "1 (1.7-meter rolling mill in Wuhan), 2 (Second Automobile Works in Shiyan), 3 (Gezhouba Hydropower Station, also known as Project 330)," are all closely related to Danjiangkou. Without the electricity from Danjiangkou, the 1.7-meter rolling mill would not run; without the construction team from Danjiangkou moving to Huanglong Town to build the Huanglongtan Hydropower Station, where would the Second Automobile Works get its electricity and water? The same goes for Gezhouba. The construction site of Danjiangkou was the training ground for the later Gezhouba construction site. The construction of the Danjiangkou project prepared the team and provided the experience for the damming of the Yangtze River.

All the shining stars are inseparable from water and electricity, either born from water and electricity or growing with water and electricity. Water is essential for irrigation, and we say that water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture. Water can also generate electricity, so water conservancy is not just the lifeline of agriculture; it is also the lifeline of industry and society. Starting from Danjiangkou, whether along the crisscrossing irrigation canals or following the spiderweb-like high-voltage lines, wherever you go, cities are prosperous, mountainous areas are thriving, and plains are bountiful. It is not difficult to draw the above conclusions.

**Five Benefits in One**

This is a concept proposed by the late Premier Zhou Enlai.

In the winter of 1972, Premier Zhou chaired a meeting to discuss the Gezhouba project. At the meeting, he unexpectedly gave everyone a topic: Among all the water conservancy projects we have undertaken over the years, which one can achieve flood control, power generation, irrigation, navigation, and aquaculture all at once? People had different opinions and heated discussions. Premier Zhou, however, foresaw that the Danjiangkou Hydropower Project could achieve all five benefits.

Facts have proven that Premier Zhou's foresight was completely correct.

In terms of flood control: Danjiangkou can control 75% of the Han River's water volume, and in conjunction with other flood control measures, it has basically ended the history of "three years of flooding in two" and "nine years of no harvest in ten" in the Jianghan Plain.

In terms of power generation: Danjiangkou is a key power station in the Central China Power Grid with outstanding capacity and electricity output, effectively ensuring the industrial and agricultural production in the Central China region.

In terms of irrigation: Danjiangkou provides a self-flowing water source for the 3.6 million mu of farmland in the irrigation areas of Hubei and Henan, turning the former barren and difficult "water bubbles" and "dry ridges" into a stable grain production base.

In terms of navigation: After the Danjiangkou Reservoir stores water, the navigation conditions of the upstream and downstream channels have undergone a fundamental change, with increased water depth and reduced shoals, fundamentally improving the navigation conditions, making the Han River a golden waterway.

In terms of aquaculture: Danjiangkou has 1 million mu of aquaculture area, and fish species that live in still or slow-moving water gradually form dominant groups, and a commercial fish production base of 50 million kilograms is about to be established.

Unlike other large-scale water conservancy projects that have only "two benefits," "three benefits," or "four benefits," only Danjiangkou has all five benefits. Such projects are not too many in our country but too few. It shows that as long as the decision is correct, it is completely worthwhile to invest a large amount of money in a few large-scale water conservancy projects with good benefits.

Danjiangkou is indeed a large-scale water conservancy project with considerable benefits. Even in terms of power generation, it has its unique advantages. In terms of installed capacity, the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station has 1.2 million kilowatts, while Danjiangkou has only 900,000 kilowatts. However, Danjiangkou is built on the Han River, which has a larger annual flow than the Yellow River, so the power generation of Liujiaxia cannot catch up with Danjiangkou. The Gezhouba Power Plant on the Yangtze River has a much greater advantage than Danjiangkou, but it is a low-head run-of-the-river power station. When a large flood peak arrives on the Yangtze River, the plant's output is obstructed, and the daily power generation and electricity output are sharply reduced. At this time, the power grid can only ask Danjiangkou to help, to generate more electricity and electricity output, to make up for the reduction in Gezhouba's output.

**Cheap Hydropower**

The Danjiangkou Hydropower Project, with its five benefits, has such good economic benefits and makes such a great contribution to society, but its own economic benefits are not high. The per capita profit level is only slightly more than half the national average of the hydropower system. The cadres and masses there told me: Although Danjiangkou flows with gold, the price of this gold is too cheap.

Water is charged at 5 fen per cubic meter, with local water conservancy taking half, leaving 2.5 fen, and this 2.5 fen is actually collected at 80% of the rate, so finally being able to collect 2 fen is already very good.

Electricity is charged at 2.8 fen per kilowatt-hour, the lowest electricity price in the country, 30% lower than the Gezhouba Power Plant, and only about 2/3 of the electricity price settled by the Central China Power Grid's provincial dispatching bureaus.

The formation of cheap hydropower has certain historical reasons, but the price seriously deviates from the value, distorting the economic benefits of the enterprise, and the problem should be put on the agenda. Currently, the Danjiangkou Hydropower Administration Bureau, as an enterprise, does not have the autonomy that an enterprise should have. It is neither a completely enterprise nor a public institution. As an enterprise, Danjiangkou has many inputs that do not directly generate economic income for the enterprise itself, such as flood control, which reflects the social benefits of the whole people and has no specific beneficiaries. Therefore, the materials and funds consumed for this cannot be compensated. Irrigation also has a similar situation. Considering the state's support for agriculture and the labor accumulation provided by farmers in the beneficiary areas during the reservoir construction, water fees cannot be basically charged. Therefore, in the near future, Danjiangkou can only mainly rely on hydropower generation to survive and develop.

The power generation of Danjiangkou is both restricted by the water volume and controlled by the peak regulation and rotating standby of the power grid, with an annual power generation of only 30-35 billion kilowatt-hours, which cannot be increased. With the current electricity price, the power generation income is difficult to break even, and the loss cannot be compensated. Where does Danjiangkou get its internal vitality? How can it talk about self-accumulation and self-development? This concern, I believe, will attract everyone's attention.

    流动的黄金
    ——记丹江口水利枢纽工程
    本报记者　黄彩忠
    三千里汉水奔流不息。人们仅在汉江与丹江的汇合处筑起一座30层楼高、武汉长江大桥两倍长的大坝；江还是那条江，水还是那么多水，江的性格却截然改变了，水的身价也提高了百倍。
    大坝凌霄，正当而立之年。近水面，千里浩瀚的人造海，蓄水量达200亿立方米，是我国最大的一座水库；背水面，装机6台、总容量90万千瓦的水电站蛰伏在大坝脚下，平均年发电38亿千瓦时，是目前我国有数的巨型水电站之一。
    自第一台机组1968年投产发电，20个年头过去了。丹江口水利枢纽工程综合效益累计达110亿元，为工程投资的13倍多。在我国目前大型水利工程中排队，数它功能最全、效益最好。
    在丹江口流动的是碧水，也是黄金！
    群星灿烂
    首先是丹江口水利枢纽工程这颗明星的崛起。1958年破土动工时，党中央和国务院一声令下，10万大军昼夜奋战，专门铺设了一条从武汉经襄樊到丹江全长431公里的汉丹铁路。丹江口这个地方早先只是旧均县的一个小村庄，工程建成蓄水后，淹没了县城，移民丹江口，鄂西北从此有了一座不夜城——丹江口市。
    襄樊市过去只有一座火力发电厂，年发电量5000万千瓦时。丹江口的强大电流输入襄樊后，这个城市一举跨入了全国重点工业城市行列，轻纺、电子、机械、化工等工业门类齐全；今天一天的工业产值比解放前一年的工业总产值还要多。享有“明星”城市之誉的襄樊，显然是沾了丹江口的“光”。
    在鄂西北和豫西南这一大片国土上，新兴的不夜城岂止丹江口市，沾光而突飞发展的又岂止襄樊市。电活了，工业就活了，整个经济也就活了。湖北人引以自豪的“1（武汉1.7米轧机）、2（十堰第二汽车制造厂）、3（葛洲坝水力发电站又称330工程）”都和丹江口有着密不可分的关系。没有丹江口的电送到武汉，1.7米轧机就开不动；没有丹江口的施工主力转移到黄龙镇拿下黄龙滩水电站，第二汽车制造厂哪来的电和水；葛洲坝也一样，当年的丹江口工地，就是后来葛洲坝工地的练兵场，丹江口工程的建设，为筑坝万里长江准备了队伍，提供了经验。
    灿烂的群星都离不开水和电，或因水、电而生，或随水、电而长。有水才能浇地，我们说水利是农业的命脉；有水还能发电，水利又何止是农业的命脉，它还是工业的命脉、社会的命脉。从丹江口出发，或沿着纵横交错的引水渠道，或顺着蛛网盘结的高压线路，所到之处，城市繁荣，山区兴旺，平原丰收，都不难得出以上体会。
    五利俱全
    这是已故周恩来总理提出来的一个概念。
    1972年冬，周总理主持一次讨论葛洲坝工程的会议。会上，他意外地给大家出了个题目：我们搞了这么多年的水利建设，哪一个工程能做到防洪、发电、灌溉、航运、养殖五利俱全？人们众说不一，议论纷纷。周总理却预见性地说：丹江口水利枢纽工程能做到五利俱全。
    事实证明，周总理的预见完全正确。
    防洪方面：丹江口可控制汉水75％的水量，配合其他防洪措施，基本结束了江汉平原“三年两淹”、“十年九不收”的灾难史。
    发电方面：丹江口在华中电网内是容量和电量都很突出的主力电站，有力地保证了华中地区工农业生产。
    灌溉方面：丹江口为鄂豫两省引丹灌区360万亩耕地提供自流引水水源，昔日荒凉多难的“水泡子”、“旱岗子”成了旱涝保收的商品粮基地。
    航运方面：丹江口水库蓄水后上下游航道起了本质变化，航深增加，浅滩减小，从根本上改善了航道条件，汉水成了一条水上黄金路。
    养殖方面：丹江口拥有100万亩水产养殖面积，适于静水或缓流中生活的鱼类逐步形成优势种群，年产500万公斤商品鱼基地即将建成。
    同是大型水利工程，人家只有“两利”、“三利”、“四利”，唯独丹江口五利俱全，这样的工程在我们国家不是太多了，而是太少了。它说明只要决策正确，花巨额投资适当搞点大型的效益好的水利工程完全值得。
    丹江口正是一个效益相当好的大型水利工程，即使同是发电，它也有独特之处。按装机容量说，刘家峡水电站为120万千瓦，丹江口只有90万千瓦，但是，丹江口建在汉水上，汉水年流量比黄河大，刘家峡的发电量远赶不上丹江口。建在长江上的葛洲坝电厂比丹江口的优势大得多，但它是低水头径流式电站，当长江大洪峰到来时，该厂出力受阻，日发电力、电量锐减，这时电网只好要求丹江口帮忙，多发电力、电量，弥补葛洲坝出力的减少。
    廉价水电
    五利俱全的丹江口水利枢纽工程，经济效益如此好，对社会贡献这么大，自身的经济效益并不高，人均留利水平只有全国水电系统平均水平的一半多一点。那里的干部群众告诉我：丹江口流动的虽然是黄金，但这黄金价格太廉。
    水，每立方只收取5厘钱，地方水利分走一半，剩下2.5厘，这2.5厘在实际征收中还要打8折，最后能拿到2厘钱就很不错了。
    电，每千瓦时收2分8厘，是全国最低电价，比葛洲坝电厂电价还低30％，仅为华中电网各省送网局结算电价的2／3左右。
    廉价水电的形成有一定的历史原因，但价格严重违背价值，扭曲了企业的经济效益，问题理应提到议事日程。目前，丹江口水利枢纽管理局，作为一个企业，它又没有企业应有的自主权，既不是完全的企业，也不是事业单位。作为企业，丹江口有许多投入对企业本身不产生直接经济收入，例如，防洪体现全民的社会效益，没有具体的受益对象，为此消耗的物资和资金不能取得补偿。灌溉也存在类似情况，考虑到国家的支农政策以及建库时受益地区农民提供了劳动积累，基本上不能收取水费。因此，丹江口近期要生存、发展，只能主要靠水力发电。
    丹江口的发电量既受水量的制约，又受电网内调峰调频和旋转备用的控制，年发电量只能在30—35亿千瓦时，不可能递增。按目前执行电价，发电收入难以保本，亏损得不到补偿，丹江口哪来内部活力？自我积累、自我发展又从何谈起？这点忧虑，相信能引起大家的重视。
