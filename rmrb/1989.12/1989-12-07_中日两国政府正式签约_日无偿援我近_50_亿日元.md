A senior official from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade stated in an interview with our reporter today that there has been a long history of grant-based financial cooperation between the governments of China and Japan. He hopes that the two countries can continue to develop this cooperative relationship.

The grant-based financial cooperation between the governments of China and Japan began in 1983. Yesterday, Vice Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Shen Jueren and Japanese Ambassador to China Hashimoto Yoshi signed the agreement in Beijing for the nearly 5 billion yen in grants that the Japanese government is providing to the Chinese government for the 1989 fiscal year. The signing, originally scheduled for early June, was delayed.

The funds will be used for four projects: 3 billion yen for purchasing equipment for Beijing Television Station, 1.608 billion yen for purchasing equipment for Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, 135 million yen for purchasing equipment to improve scientific and technological education for youth in Ningxia, and 133 million yen for purchasing equipment for Ningxia Nursing School.
