The Yiyang Sewing Machine Factory has invested hundreds of millions of yuan in technological upgrades in recent years, establishing an advanced molding production line. The factory's well covers and manhole covers for highways and airports were selected by German commercial entities this year. In just half a year, they passed the inspection by the Federal Republic of Germany's national inspection agency, meeting the country's national standards.
