Loyal to the Country, Struggle for Life
——In Memory of Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo
Liu Guisheng

Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo, a renowned patriot, social activist, and political scientist in our country, experienced the old democratic revolution, the new democratic revolution, and the socialist revolution and construction over three historical periods. He walked alongside our nation and people through a long, winding, and unyielding path of struggle and progress. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Mr. Zhang's birth, we humbly present this article to express our remembrance and admiration.

Participating in the Revolution, Seeking Progress

Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo, originally named Zhang Yun, with the courtesy name Yi Nong and the pseudonym Xi Ruo, later changed to Xie Ruo, was born in October 1889 in Shaanxi. His childhood and youth were during a time when the Chinese nation faced severe external threats and internal chaos, with the people living in extreme hardship and the nation in deep crisis. The harsh reality educated and drove him to set his mind on saving the country at the age of 20, joining the Tongmenghui, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and engaging in revolutionary activities. At that time, the leader of the Tongmenghui's Shaanxi branch was Jing Wumu, and Zhang Xie Ruo assisted him in guiding and helping the local Ge Lao Hui to carry out anti-Qing activities. Later, he was dispatched by Jing Wumu to Japan to purchase explosives and handguns for the uprising. After several twists and turns, he arrived in Shanghai, where he met Song Jiaoren and Chen Ying. After going to Japan, he also met Wu Yuzhang and Ren Hongjun. When he had purchased the military supplies and was preparing to hide them in a sofa for transport back to China, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. He was then ordered to return to Shaanxi to instigate the uprising. Upon arrival, he served as a member of the newly established revolutionary government. However, the new government was soon controlled by the Ge Lao Hui, and the Tongmenghui sent Zhang Xie Ruo to Wuhan to establish direct contact with Huang Xing. On his way to Xichuan, Henan, he was captured by the Qing army and imprisoned in the Nanyang prison for more than two months. After Nanyang was liberated, he was freed from danger. By the time the north-south peace talks succeeded, Yuan Shikai usurped power, suppressed the revolutionary party, and marginalized Dr. Sun Yat-sen, making the national situation even darker. Zhang Xie Ruo thus deeply felt that the Xinhai Revolution "except for overthrowing the Qing dynasty and replacing the monarchical system with the so-called republican system, the revolution was merely superficial. The emperor was replaced by the president, the governor by the military governor, but China was not more modernized." He also felt that "the revolutionary party was indeed rich in passion, courage, and spirit of sacrifice, but after the revolution succeeded, in terms of governing the country and building the nation, they were at a loss in planning and execution." Zhang Xie Ruo "in this state of disappointment" decided to go abroad to study, "to learn some real knowledge and return to help build the new nation after the revolution." (Zhang Xie Ruo: "Memoirs of the Xinhai Revolution," p. 65-66, 1947 edition by Life Bookstore) In July 1913, Zhang Xie Ruo went to the United States for further studies. In the fall of 1915, he entered Columbia University to study political science, and in the spring of 1918, he obtained a bachelor's degree. In the spring of 1919, he obtained a master's degree.

During his studies in the United States, Zhang Xie Ruo reflected on and pondered the gains and losses of the Xinhai Revolution and his own journey, realizing that the Chinese revolution's mission was far from complete. To make the country strong and the people prosperous, a brand-new democratic society must be established. He delved into the vast literature on Western democratic and human rights thoughts and related scientific and cultural knowledge, extensively reading and learning from various sources, laying a solid foundation for his future teaching and research in political science.

In October 1920, Zhang Xie Ruo completed his studies and returned to China. At this time, through summarizing, observing, and thinking, he realized that the key to the success of the Chinese revolution lay in the improvement of the political and cultural quality of the masses. Only when the entire nation rises up can the revolution succeed. For this reason, from March 1921 to the winter of 1924, he went to Europe again for inspection. After returning to the country, he was determined to invest his knowledge and energy into cultural education, to cultivate the youth and revitalize the nation. From August 1929 to November 1952, Zhang Xie Ruo served as a professor in the Department of Political Science at Tsinghua University, teaching courses such as the history of Western political thought and selected readings, specialized research on the history of Western political thought, Plato's political philosophy, and Rousseau's political philosophy. During this period, he systematically organized his thoughts and insights and published them in newspapers. He successively wrote "The Origin of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man," "Rousseau and Human Rights," "A Study of the Social Contract," "The Evolution of Natural Law," and other articles. These articles expounded on the social and historical background, formation process, and significance of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, spreading the ideas of human rights, rule of law, and democracy. However, his vision and thoughts were not confined to simply transplanting Western ideas and institutions. He always had in mind the national historical traditions and social realities. For this reason, he published the article "Complete Westernization and Chinese Position," criticizing the erroneous propositions of advocating "complete Westernization" and insisting on "native culture" while pointing out that China's modernization was "urgently needed today," but our "national pride should not be defeated" and "national confidence should not be shaken." He said, "Blind conservatism is wrong, and random Westernization is absurd," and proposed the modernization of thought, scholarship, science, and industry. (Guowen Weekly, Vol. 12, No. 23, June 17, 1935) Although these views were not profound and insightful at the time, they were quite rare among ordinary intellectuals.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Zhang Xie Ruo tirelessly sought the path to national revival and salvation. He studied, researched, taught, propagated, observed, and thought, with unwavering dedication. In his early years, he did not, like some advanced intellectuals, accept Marxism. He did not believe that Marxism could save China. However, the development of Chinese society made him gradually see that the Western democratic thoughts he believed in and the democratic politics he longed for were not only far from being realized but also difficult to realize. This forced him to pay attention to the fate of the world socialist cause and the progress of Marxism in China. During the War of Resistance, he witnessed the tragic situation of starvation and suffering in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the corrupt lives of the officials, while on the other hand, he learned from the people's oral traditions and underground materials and documents provided by the Communist Party of China that in another part of the motherland, there was a clean government and a vigorous anti-Japanese force composed of soldiers and civilians, which had become the backbone of saving the nation from crisis. This was in sharp contrast to the corrupt face of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who passively resisted Japan, actively opposed communism, were corrupt and decadent, and ruled by dictatorship. Facts educated him, making him see light in despair and gradually placing his hopes for national rejuvenation on the Communist Party of China. From this time on, he joined with Wu Han, Wen Yiduo, and other active figures in the Chinese democratic political arena to strive for democratic politics. With the victory of the Chinese revolution, Zhang Xie Ruo, like many patriotic democrats, stood more resolutely on the side of the Communist Party of China and the masses, and made his own contribution to the birth of New China.

Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo did not join the Communist Party of China, but he was a sincere friend of the Communist Party of China. His life journey, from ardent patriotism to persistent admiration for Western democratic thoughts, seeking Western democratic politics, to struggling for the socialist cause, was long and winding, and was similar to the path taken by many patriotic democrats. However, his life also had its unique characteristics, that is, he firmly stood on the soil of the motherland, and his thoughts and actions were all directed towards the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the actual needs of society. He had profound cultural accomplishments and profound knowledge of politics and law, but his academic pursuits and political and social activities were almost fused into one. Whatever he believed to be the correct path, he would pursue it sincerely and fearlessly. Such character and demeanor were all the more precious and brilliant in the face of national difficulties.

For the Country and the People, Adhering to the Truth

After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army advanced towards North China. The battles at the Great Wall failed, and the Kuomintang Nanjing government signed the humiliating Tanggu Truce with Japan, causing a serious North China crisis. Zhang Xie Ruo was deeply worried and published the article "Diplomacy Since the Tanggu Truce," clearly pointing out that diplomacy since the Tanggu Truce was "completely wrong," "making one feel extremely uneasy about the future of the country at all times." He analyzed the "biggest root of the problem" of this misguided diplomacy as "fear of sacrifice on one hand and hoping that the other side (referring to Japan) would not go too far on the other hand." "Because of the fear of sacrifice, one could only hope that the other side would not go too far. And because the other side carried out the traditional 'national strategy,' it could not help but go too far, so the sacrifice was ultimately unavoidable," the result of which was that "the other side saw through your unwillingness to sacrifice and unwillingness to resist, and the demands became more and more, the pressure became greater and greater, making you unable to cope, running around, and eventually turning a problem that could have been solved with a small sacrifice into one that could not be solved even with a big sacrifice." He declared: "If we do not change our course, in the struggle and sacrifice, we will find a way out, the national crisis will only deepen day by day, and it will not stop until it is destroyed." (Independent Review, No. 144, March 31, 1935) He firmly advocated resistance against Japan, so he criticized the Kuomintang government's surrender diplomacy. However, soon after, the "special status of North China" was unfortunately formed. Zhang Xie Ruo was deeply saddened. To change this "country that is no longer a country," he published the article "Hebei and Chahar Should Not Consider Themselves Special" in the Independent Review, No. 229, on November 29, 1936, proposing to the Kuomintang government to cancel the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee and order the 29th Army to the front line. This was a double blow, striking the Kuomintang Central's "bulk sale" policy on the Japanese issue and the local authorities' "retail" plan. They became even more panicked and simply ordered the closure of the Independent Review.

After the war of resistance broke out, Tsinghua University, together with Peking University and Nankai University, moved to Kunming and formed the Southwest Associated University. Zhang Xie Ruo went to the school and served as the head of the Department of Political Science. In July 1938, the Kuomintang government, under the pressure of the people of the whole country, held the National People's Political Council in Wuhan. Zhang Xie Ruo was invited to serve as a council member and attended the meeting. He spoke frankly, and whenever he thought it was related to the interests of the country and the nation, he spoke passionately, truly embodying the spirit of "If it is beneficial to the country, I will risk my life, and I will not avoid disaster for personal gain or loss." At that time, he still placed his hopes for resistance against Japan on Chiang Kai-shek. However, as the War of Resistance deepened and prolonged, the corrupt face of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who compromised with the enemy externally and stubbornly maintained their position internally, became increasingly exposed. Zhang Xie Ruo gradually lost confidence in their so-called "resistance against Japan." At the second session of the second National People's Political Council held in March 1941, he sharply criticized Kong Xiangxi's financial report for covering up the true situation of currency inflation, with sharp words. The chairman of the meeting, Chiang Kai-shek, was very angry and rang the bell for a long time to warn him to stop speaking, then said sullenly: "We welcome the expression of opinions, but please pay attention to your attitude, and it is not good to use sharp language." Zhang Xie Ruo was not moved and insisted on finishing his speech before leaving the venue, then immediately returned to the Southwest Associated University in Kunming to protest. Later, the National People's Political Council sent a notice and travel expenses to participate in the meeting, but Zhang Xie Ruo replied by telegram: "There is no politics to discuss, and the travel expenses are returned." From then on, he no longer participated in the National People's Political Council.

In 1942 and 1943, Zhang Xie Ruo, through observation and thinking, formed the following understanding: China must advance by overthrowing the rule of the Kuomintang, and the only political force that can lead the people to realize this future is the Communist Party of China. On May 3, 1944, at the "May 4th" memorial evening held by the students of the Associated University, he spoke publicly, criticizing the Kuomintang government and expressing his determination to work with the young students in the future to strive for progress and democracy.

In 1945, before the old Political Consultative Conference was held, the Democratic League recommended Zhang Xie Ruo as a representative of social elites (non-partisan democrats) to participate in the conference. The Kuomintang knew Zhang Xie Ruo's consistent style and feared that he would completely stand on the opposite side, so they insisted that he was a Kuomintang member and did not agree. When reporters asked about this, Zhang Xie Ruo revealed the truth to society, saying: "Yes, I was a member of the Tongmenghui. Before the Xinhai Revolution, I ran around a lot. But in the first year of the Republic, the Tongmenghui was reorganized into the Kuomintang, and in the second year of the Republic, I went to the United States before I declared to the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee that I had severed the relationship." He wrote a letter to the Kuomintang Central Organization Department, asking them to show evidence if they said he was a Kuomintang member, and whether they could find his year of joining the party and his membership number. He also wrote a solemn declaration and published it in the Chongqing "Dagongbao," strongly refuting the evil intentions of the Kuomintang authorities. At the same time, he gave a speech in front of the large lawn of the Southwest Associated University Library, proposing to "abolish one-party rule and personal dictatorship," and was the first to publicly respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to establish a coalition government. He said: "The current Kuomintang government is a government in terms of law, but in terms of morality, it is a gang of robbers." He also said: "We often see a term in the newspapers called 'Red Bandits.' If the Communist Party can be called 'Red Bandits,' I think the Kuomintang can be called 'White Bandits.'" In fact, "'White' is too good, too clean, they are simply 'Black Bandits.'" They "say all the good things and do all the bad things." We demand to "end party rule, end tutelage" immediately and establish a coalition government. The full text of this speech was published in the inaugural issue of the "Student Newspaper" on January 19, 1946, and won the warm praise of the broad masses of students and intellectuals. From then on, Zhang Xie Ruo's talent, courage, and integrity left a deep impression on his contemporaries and students, and also set a good example for the scholarly community.

The Kuomintang reactionaries were determined to oppose communism and actively launched a counter-revolutionary civil war. With the victory of the War of Liberation, a massive patriotic democratic movement swept through the Kuomintang-controlled areas. At this time, Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo had returned to Beijing's Tsinghua Garden with the school from Kunming. He published the article "How the People Will Get Through This War Difficulty" in the "Democratic Weekly" (Issue 10, March 1, 1947), pointing out that "this war is a war between a party with ideals that wants to reform reality and a party that has completely lost its ideals and only wants to maintain its vested interests. The party with ideals, in order to realize its ideals, naturally cannot avoid removing obstacles; the party in power, in order to maintain its vested interests, also cannot use various methods to suppress and eliminate the power of the emerging political groups." This fully showed his clear political stance and attitude of supporting the Communist Party of China. It is undeniable that Zhang Xie Ruo had previously held the view that "the problem of China lies in external threats and internal chaos." He said that the internal chaos was the people's revolution led by the Communist Party. (See "The State Cannot Be Neglected Anymore" in the Independent Review, No. 186, January 20, 1936) However, the development of actual social life educated him, making him see through the decadence and reactionary nature of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, so he frankly told the students that he himself had a process of transformation from supporting the Kuomintang to supporting the Communist Party. He now thoroughly understood that it was not others, but the Kuomintang that led China into civil war, and only the Communist Party could save China.

By the spring of 1948, the situation was increasingly developing in favor of the victory of the people's revolution. Zhang Xie Ruo participated in several student-organized symposiums, confidently asserting: "The current revolution in China will certainly succeed, and this is the only way out." He criticized those who held a wait-and-see and doubtful attitude towards the revolution or attempted to create a third way between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, saying that these people "made the mistake of not truly struggling for the welfare of the people!" (Don't Let Down the Times, Tsinghua Weekly, Issue 6, April 3, 1948) Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo resolutely abandoned the third way, which fully showed his foresight and wisdom, indicating that his thoughts and actions were based on the actual situation of China and had already firmly grasped the truth of history.

In 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in Beijing, and Zhang Xie Ruo participated in the preparatory meeting held in the Yinyuan Hall of Zhongnanhai. During the discussion on the national flag, capital, national name, and national anthem, he strongly expressed his opinion, believing that one should not forget danger in times of peace and advocating the continued use of the lyrics of the "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem. When someone proposed to name the country "People's Democratic Republic of China," Zhang Xie Ruo disagreed. He agreed with the proposal to name the country the "People's Republic of China." He said: "The People's Republic" had already explained our political system. The word "people" refers to workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, which "already expresses the meaning of people's democratic dictatorship, so there is no need to let the word 'democratic' appear again to avoid repetition." His opinion was supported and approved by the majority of the representatives.

After the founding of New China, Zhang Xie Ruo undertook many leadership positions. In addition to serving as a standing committee member of the Tsinghua University Administrative Committee, he also successively served as a member of the Central People's Government, vice chairman of the State Council Legal Affairs Commission, Minister of Education, and chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Cultural Exchange. He was also a representative of the first, second, and third National People's Congresses, a standing committee member of the first, second, third, and fourth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conferences, and president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. He devoted himself to the socialist revolution and construction with great enthusiasm. He welcomed every major achievement of the socialist cause with a sincere heart and always spoke out on problems in his work. In 1957, before the Anti-Rightist Campaign, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the whole country to help the Party rectify its style. At a symposium held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Xie Ruo summarized his views on some problems in his work with 16 characters: "Great achievements, impatience for quick results, contempt for the past, and blind faith in the future." He was expressing his opinions from the standpoint of caring for the Party and the people's interests. Although he was criticized later, he was able to handle it correctly.

On July 18, 1973, Mr. Zhang Xie Ruo passed away in Beijing.

Reviewing the above deeds of Mr. Zhang, we see a scholar who struggled tirelessly for the country and the people throughout his life and whose thoughts kept pace with the times. His deep love for the country and the nation, his dedication to the country and the pursuit of truth and progress, his hatred for the reactionaries, and his sincere and frank attitude towards the people are all worthy of our learning. People remember this patriot and democrat who made important contributions to the people's revolutionary cause.

    忠诚为国　毕生奋斗
    ——纪念张奚若先生
    刘桂生
    张奚若先生，我国著名的爱国民主人士、社会活动家、政治学家，一生历经旧民主主义革命、新民主主义革命和社会主义革命与建设三个历史时期，同我们的国家、民族一道，走过了漫长曲折、不断奋斗、不断前进的道路。在奚若先生诞生百周年之际，谨以此文表达我们的忆念和敬仰。
                参加革命　精进求新
    张奚若先生，原名耘，字亦农，号熙若，后改奚若，1889年10月生，陕西人。他的童年、少年时期，正是中华民族外患方殷，内乱迭乘，人民生活极度困厄，民族危机十分深重的时候。苦难的现实，教育和推动他在二十岁时就抱定救国大志，参加同盟会，追随孙中山先生，从事革命活动。当时的同盟会陕西支部长是井勿幕，张奚若协助他引导和帮助反清的当地哥老会开展工作。随后接受井勿幕的指派，赴日本购买起义用的炸药和手枪。几经转折，到达上海，结识了宋教仁、陈英士等人，到日本后，又认识了吴玉章、任鸿隽等人。在他购妥军火并准备将其藏在沙发里托运回国时，武昌起义爆发，随即奉命赶赴陕西策动起义。抵陕后担任新成立的革命政府参议。但不久新政权被哥老会所控制，同盟会派张奚若前往武汉，与黄兴建立直接联系，行至河南淅川，被清军逮捕，羁押于南阳监狱二月有余。南阳光复，方才得免于难。迄南北议和成功，袁世凯窃国专权，压制革命党人，排挤孙中山先生，国事愈加昏暗。张奚若由此深感辛亥革命“除了推翻清室，把君主政体换成所谓共和政体之外，革命是徒有其表的。皇帝换了总统，巡抚改称都督，而中国并没有更现代化一点。”同时也“颇感觉革命党人固然是富于热情勇气和牺牲精神，但革命成功后于治理国家、建设国家，在计划及实行方面，就一筹莫展”。张奚若“在这种失望情形下”，“便决定到外国去读书，预备学些实在的学问，回来帮助建设革命后的新国家。”（张奚若：《辛亥革命回忆录》，第65—66页，1947年生活书店版）1913年7月，张奚若赴美深造。1915年秋，进入哥伦比亚大学学习政治学，1918年春得学士学位，1919年春得硕士学位。
    在美国学习期间，张奚若回顾与思索辛亥革命的得失与自己走过的道路，意识到中国革命的任务远远没有完成，要国强民富，必须建立一个崭新的民主的社会。他潜心于浩繁的西方民主、人权思想的论著和有关的科学文化知识，广泛涉猎，博采众长，为他日后从事政治学的教学和研究奠定了坚实的基础。
    1920年10月，张奚若结束学业回国。这时，他通过总结、观察与思考，认识到中国革命成功的关键在于民众政治文化素质的提高，只有全民族奋起，革命才能成功。为此，他自1921年3月至1924年冬，再度赴欧洲考察。归国后立志把自己的知识与精力投入文化教育事业，以培育青年，振兴民族。自1929年8月至1952年11月，张奚若在清华大学政治学系任教授，讲授西洋政治思想史及名著选读、西洋政治思想史专题研究、柏拉图政治哲学和卢梭政治哲学等课程。在这一时期内，他把自己的思考和认识系统地整理出来，发表于报端。他先后写出了《法国人权宣言的来源问题》、
  《卢梭与人权》、《社约论考》、《自然法则之演进》等。这些文章阐述了人权宣言产生的社会历史背景、形成过程和重要意义，传播了人权、法制和民主思想。但他的视野的思绪并没有囿于单纯移植西方思想、制度，始终萦绕于心的是民族历史传统和社会现实状况。为此，他发表了《全盘西化与中国本位》一文，在批判提倡“全盘西化”和坚持“本位文化”两种错误主张的同时，指出中国实现现代化为“今日之所急需”，但我们的“民族自尊心不应该打倒”，“民族自信心不应该动摇”。他说“盲目的保守固然不对，随便乱化也是笑话”，并提出思想、学术、科学、工业四方面现代化的主张。（《国闻周报》第12卷第23期，1935年6月17日）这些见解在当时虽非精深透辟之论，但在一般知识分子中足称罕见。
    在二三十年代，张奚若孜孜不倦地寻求振兴救亡的道路。他学习、研究，教学、宣传、观察、思考，拳拳之心，始终不渝。他早年没有像一些先进知识分子那样，接受马克思主义，他不相信马克思主义能够救中国。但中国现实社会的发展，使他逐渐看到他所崇信的西方民主思想和所企盼的民主政治，不仅远未实现而且难以实现，从而迫使他关注世界社会主义事业的命运和马克思主义在中国的进展。抗战期间，他一方面目睹国民党统治区饿殍遍野、民不聊生的悲惨景况与达官贵人“前方吃紧，后方紧吃”的腐朽生活；另一方面，他又从人民口耳相传和中国共产党地下组织提供的材料、文件中，认识到在祖国大地的另一方，有一个廉洁的政府和一股由军民联合组成的朝气蓬勃的抗日力量，已成为挽救民族危亡的中流砥柱，这与国民党反动派消极抗日，积极反共，贪污腐化，独裁专制的腐朽面孔，形成尖锐的对比。事实教育了他，使他在绝望中看到光明，逐渐把民族复兴的希望，寄托在中国共产党身上。从这时起，他便同活跃在中国民主政坛的吴晗、闻一多等人一道，为民主政治而奔走。随着中国革命的胜利进展，张奚若同许多爱国民主人士一样，愈来愈坚决地站到中国共产党和人民大众一边，并为新中国的诞生作出了自己的贡献。
    张奚若先生没有加入中国共产党，但他是中国共产党真诚的朋友，他的一生由热烈的爱国主义到执著地崇仰西方民主思想，追求西方民主政治，到为社会主义事业而奋斗，道路漫长而曲折，也同许多爱国民主人士走过的路大致相同。但他的一生又有着鲜明的特色，那就是切切实实地立足于祖国的大地，思想的追求，行动的采取，都努力以中国人民的根本利益和社会的实际需要为依归，他有着高深的文化修养和深湛的政法学识，但他的思想学术探求，与政治社会活动实践几乎融合为
  一。凡他认定的正确道路，便挚诚直趋，无所顾讳。这样的品格和风貌，在国运艰辛之际，显得愈加难能可贵而光彩夺目。
              为国为民　服膺真理
    九·一八事变以后，日军向华北逼进。长城各口抗战失败，国民党南京政府同日本签订了屈辱的《塘沽协定》，造成严重的华北危机。张奚若忧心如焚，发表《塘沽协定以来的外交》一文，明确指出，塘沽协定以来的外交是“全盘皆错”，
  “令人对于国家前途无时不感觉一种极度的不安。”他分析这种误国外交的“最大病根，一方面是怕牺牲，一方面是希望人家（指日本——引者）不为已甚”。“因为怕牺牲，所以只得希望人家不为已甚。又因人家施行传统的‘国策’，不能不为已甚，所以牺牲终极还是免不了”，其后果就是“人家窥破了你不愿牺牲、不敢抵抗的畏缩的心理，要求越来越多，压力越来越大，使你应接不暇，疲于奔命，结果把原来用小牺牲可以解决的问题弄得经过大牺牲还是无法解决。”他申言：“若不改弦更张，在奋斗牺牲中找出路，国难只有日深一日，不至灭顶不止。”（《独立评论》，第144号，1935年3月31日）他坚决主张抗日，所以对国民党政府的投降外交，提出批评。然而，不久之后，“华北特殊化”的局面不幸终于形成。张奚若倍感痛心。为着改变这种“国已不国”的状况，他于1936年11月29日在《独立评论》第229号上发表《冀察不应以特殊自居》一文，向国民党政府提出取消冀察政务委员会和令二十九军开赴前线两项要求。这样就一箭双雕，击中国民党中央在对日问题上的“趸卖”方针和华北地方当局的“零售”计划。他们越发恐慌，干脆下令将《独立评论》封闭。
    抗战爆发后，清华大学同北京大学、南开大学南迁昆明，合组西南联合大学。张奚若随校前往，任政治学系主任。1938年7月，国民党政府迫于全国人民的要求，在武汉召开国民参政会。张奚若应聘为参政员，出席会议。他直言不讳，凡自己认为国家民族利害所系，慷慨陈词，真可谓“苟利国家生死以，岂因祸福避趋之”。这时，他还把抗日的希望，寄托在蒋介石身上。但随着抗日战争的深入持久，国民党反动派对外妥协、动摇，对内坚持顽固立场的腐朽面貌日益暴露，张奚若对他们口中的“抗日”，逐渐丧失信心。在国民参政会1941年3月召开的二届一次会议上，他尖锐地批驳了孔祥熙的财政报告中为掩饰通货膨胀真象而设的遁词，话锋犀利。主持会议的蒋介石大为恼火，长时间按铃警告，要他中止发言，接着又悻悻地说：欢迎发表意见，但请注意态度，用语尖刻不好。张奚若未为所动，坚持至发言毕始离场而去，随即返回昆明西南联大，以示抗议。后来，国民参政会寄去开会的通知和路费，要他参加会议，张奚若回电说：“无政可议，路费退回”。从此不再参加国民参政会。
    1942、1943年间，张奚若经过观察和思考，形成这样的认识：中国要前进就必须推翻国民党的统治，而能够带领人民实现这一前途的唯一政治力量就是中国共产党。1944年5月3日，他在联大学生举行的“五四”纪念晚会上讲话，公开抨击国民党政府，并表示今后在争取进步和民主的事业中，要和青年学生“一齐努力”。
    1945年，在旧政协召开之前，民盟推荐张奚若作为社会贤达（即无党派民主人士）代表，参加大会。国民党深知张奚若的一贯作风，更怕他完全站到自己的对立面去，便一口咬定他是国民党党员，不予同意。有记者追问此事，张奚若向社会披露了事实真相，他说：“不错，我曾是一个同盟会员。辛亥革命前，我很奔走了一番。但民国元年同盟会改组为国民党，民国二年我去美国前即已向陕西省党部声明脱离关系。”他给国民党中央组织部写信，质问他们说他是国民党员，有什么凭证，可否查出他的入党年月和证件号码。并且还写了份郑重声明，在重庆《大公报》上刊发，有力地回击了国民党当局的险恶用心。与此同时，他又在西南联大图书馆前大草坪上发表演说，提出“废止一党专政，取消个人独裁”的要求，率先公开响应中国共产党中央关于建立联合政府的号召。他说：“现在国民党的政府，在法律上说是政府，在道德上却是强盗”。他又说：“我们在报纸上常常可以看到一个名词‘赤匪’，假如共产党可以叫‘赤匪’的话，我想国民党就可以叫‘白匪’”。其实“‘白’字还太好了，太干净了，他们简直就是
  ‘黑匪’”。他们这伙人“好话说尽，坏事做绝”。我们要求立即“结束党治，结束训政”，建立联合政府。这次演讲的全文发表在1946年1月19日出版的《学生报》创刊号上，赢得了广大青年和知识界人士的热烈赞扬。从此，张奚若的才智、勇敢和傲骨，在同辈人和学生中留下极为深刻的印象，也为士林树立了良好风范。
    国民党反动派一心反共，积极发动反革命内战。随着解放战争的胜利发展，国民党统治区掀起了声势浩大的爱国民主运动。这时张奚若先生已随校从昆明回到了北平清华园。他在
  《民主周刊》上发表了《人民怎样渡过这内战的难关》（第10期，1947年3月1日）一文，指出“今天这个战争是一个富有理想的、要改革现实社会的政党，与一个完全失掉理想的、专要保持既得利益的政党的战争。有理想的政党为了实现其理想，自然不能不排除拦路的障碍；操有政权的政党，为了保持其既得利益，也不能不用各种方法来压迫和消灭新兴政治集团的力量”。完全表明了他支持中共的鲜明的政治立场和态度。无须讳言，张奚若过去对国事曾有过“中国的问题在于外患和内乱”的看法。他说的内乱就是共产党领导的人民革命。（见
  《国是不能再马虎下去了》《独立评论》第186号，1936年1月20日）然而，实际社会生活的发展教育了他，使他认清蒋介石政权的腐朽性、反动性，于是，他毫不掩饰地告诉学生，他自己从支持国民党到支持共产党，有一个转变过程。他现在已透彻地认识到，不是别人，正是国民党把中国引向内战，而只有共产党才能救中国。
    到1948年春天，形势越来越向着有利于人民革命胜利的方向发展，张奚若多次参加学生举行的座谈会，信心百倍地断言：“中国目前的革命必然成功，这是唯一的出路。”他批评那些对革命持观望和怀疑态度或企图在国共之间另创第三条道路的人，说这些人“犯了不愿真正为人民福利而奋斗的错误！”（《不要辜负了时代》，《清华旬刊》第6期，1948年4月3日）张奚若先生如此坚决地摒弃了第三条道路，这充分表明他的远见卓识，表明他的思想与行动是切切实实地从中国国情出发，并且已经牢牢把握住了历史的真理。
    1949年，新的中国人民政治协商会议在北京召开，张奚若参加了在中南海颐年堂举行的预备会。在讨论国旗、首都、国名、国歌时，他力陈己见，认为居安不能忘危，主张仍然用
  《义勇军进行曲》的歌词作为国歌歌词。当有人提议将国名定为“中华人民民主共和国”时，张奚若表示不同意。他赞成把国名定为“中华人民共和国”的主张。他说：“人民共和国”已说明了我们的国体。“人民”二字指工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，这“已经把人民民主专政的意思表达出来了，因此，不必让‘民主’二字再出现一次，以免重复。”他的意见受到大多数代表的赞同和支持，获得了大会的通过。
    新中国成立以后，张奚若担负过许多领导工作。除了曾担任清华大学校务委员会常务委员以外，还先后出任中央人民政府委员、政务院法制委员会副主任委员、教育部部长、对外文化联络委员会主任等职，并且是第一、二、三届全国人大代表，中国人民政治协商会议第一、二、三、四届常委，中国人民外交学会会长。他以极大的热情投身于社会主义革命和建设事业。他以一颗真诚的心，欢迎社会主义事业的每一重大成就，同时，对工作中的问题也从来是有所见就提，知无不言。1957年反右之前，中共中央号召全国人民帮助党整风。在全国政协召开的座谈会上，张奚若用16个字概括地表达了自己对工作中存在的一些问题的看法：“好大喜功，急功近利，鄙视既往，迷信将来”。他是从爱护党和人民利益的立场出发来提意见的。尽管以后受到一些批评，但他都能正确对待。
    1973年7月18日，张奚若先生在北京病逝。
    重温张先生的上述事迹，使我们看到一位毕生为祖国为人民奋斗不懈，并且使自己的思想不断跟着时代前进的可钦可敬的学人的风貌。他对国家民族深沉的爱，他以身许国、追求真理与进步的精神，他对反动派疾恶如仇、对人民热诚坦率的刚毅正直的高尚风范，他的勇敢和才智都是值得我们学习的。人们怀念这位为人民革命事业作出过重要贡献的爱国民主人士。
