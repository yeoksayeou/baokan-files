Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, stated in a declaration today that leaving Cambodia's seat in the United Nations vacant will only worsen the situation in Cambodia.

The declaration pointed out that announcing Cambodia's seat as vacant will further intensify the war between the forces of the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea and the Vietnamese colonialist troops. The declaration stated that if anyone is to be expelled from the United Nations, it should not be the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea, but Vietnam. Vietnam has committed and is still committing the crimes of invading, destroying, colonizing, and oppressing the Cambodian people.

Prince Sihanouk stated in the declaration that the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea does not accept and will not accept negotiations with the "Quisling" regime in Phnom Penh. He said that if a meeting on the "Cambodian" issue must be held in Jakarta or Paris, then this meeting must be of an international nature, with an international composition, and Vietnam must participate because it is Vietnam that caused the Cambodian war and the so-called "Cambodian" issue.

The declaration stated that the "Cambodian" issue is not an issue between the various factions in Cambodia, but an issue between the Vietnamese invaders and the invaded Cambodia. Therefore, the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea resolutely rejects invitations to participate in the "four-party" meeting to be held in Jakarta, Paris, or any other place.

Prince Sihanouk suggested, "In the current situation where a temporary government of the four parties cannot be established, simultaneously dissolve the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea and the illegal Hun Sen regime, send a United Nations international supervisory body and United Nations peacekeeping forces to Cambodia, have this body and force disarm the four-party armies, and place Cambodia under United Nations trusteeship until Cambodia completes universal elections under United Nations supervision."

### 西哈努克发表声明 “空缺”柬在联合国席位  将只能恶化柬埔寨局势

    西哈努克发表声明
   “空缺”柬在联合国席位
    将只能恶化柬埔寨局势
    新华社北京12月11日电　民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王在他今天发表的一项声明中说，“空缺”柬埔寨在联合国的席位将只能恶化柬埔寨的局势。
    这项声明指出，宣布柬埔寨席位“空缺”的后果将进一步加剧民柬联合政府的部队和越南殖民主义军队之间的战争。声明说，如果要把谁从联合国驱逐出去的话，被驱逐的不应是民柬联合政府，而是越南。越南过去犯下了、并且现在仍在犯着侵略、破坏柬埔寨、使柬埔寨殖民化和压迫柬埔寨人民的罪行。
    西哈努克亲王在声明中说，民柬联合政府现在不接受、将来也不会接受同金边“吉斯林”政权进行谈判。他说，如果必须在雅加达或巴黎举行一次关于“柬埔寨”问题的会议的话，那么这次会议必须具有国际性质，其组成也必须是国际性的，必须要有越南参加，因为是越南造成了柬埔寨战争和所谓“柬埔寨”问题。
    声明说，“柬埔寨”问题不是柬埔寨各派之间的问题，而是越南侵略者和被侵略的柬埔寨之间的问题。因此，民柬联合政府断然拒绝参加在雅加达、或巴黎、或其他地方召开的“柬四方”会议的邀请。
    西哈努克亲王建议，“在目前尚不能成立柬四方临时政府的情况下，同时解散民柬联合政府和非法的洪森政权，派遣联合国国际监督机构和联合国维持和平部队到柬埔寨，由该机构和部队解除柬四方军队的武装，并把柬埔寨置于联合国的托管之下，直到柬埔寨在联合国的监督下完成普选。”
