The highly anticipated 14th FIFA World Cup will take place in the summer of 1990 in Italy. After a grueling 31-month battle, the 24 strongest teams have secured their tickets to Rome. Over the past three years, the host country has invested heavily in building and renovating numerous sports facilities and service infrastructures, including roads, overpasses, news centers, television towers, airports, and docks.

How to recoup the substantial investments? This is a practical question facing the host country. Reports indicate that the promotional posters for the World Cup are ingeniously designed and imaginative, already plastering the streets. The "mascot" of the World Cup, a child's model made of red, white, and green (the colors of the Italian flag) building blocks, is already well-known. Italy boasts picturesque landscapes and a rich cultural heritage, with a thriving tourism industry that brings in over $100 billion annually. The upcoming month-long "soccer war" will attract even more tourists with its unique charm and grandeur. Many hotels' booking departments are bustling with business, and "fully booked" signs are already up for the tournament period. Numerous companies are working around the clock to produce items featuring the "mascot" and images of star players, such as shirts, sweatshirts, handbags, notebooks, calendars, and commemorative badges. Some are rushing to record CDs, cassette tapes, video tapes, and films. The national printing bureau is also busy producing various stamps and gold and silver coins. The host country, Italy, is leveraging the soccer fans' enthusiasm to prepare for the upcoming sports extravaganza, providing satisfactory services and attractive items to earn more dollars.

The "12 City Records" documentary, directed by 12 renowned filmmakers, cost $4.3 million to produce. Among the directors are Bernardo Bertolucci ("The Last Emperor") and Franco Zeffirelli ("La Traviata"). They will showcase the charm and art of the 12 host cities of the 1990 World Cup through innovative ideas and outstanding film art. Each short film is 8 minutes long, introducing one of the 12 host cities. During the tournament, these films will be shown to the billions of viewers through "World Television Broadcasts," allowing them to first appreciate the cityscapes and then enjoy the battles on the green field. By blending art and soccer, the host country not only promotes its national image but also stands to gain several times the $4.3 million investment. The 96-minute film premiered on December 9th, when FIFA and the leaders of the 24 qualifying national football associations, along with famous players, actors, and singers, gathered in Rome for a grand draw ceremony. From that day forward, the starting gun for the 14th FIFA World Cup was officially fired. It is easy to imagine that alongside the global "soccer fever" is the host country's meticulously planned "business fever."

    “足球热”与“生意经”
    王海亭
    举世瞩目的第十四届足球世界杯赛1990年初夏将在意大利举行。经过长达31个月的生死搏斗，绿茵场上硝烟滚滚，群雄逐鹿，24强终于拿到进军罗马的入场券。
    3年多来东道国为了迎接这场世界体育盛会，耗资甚巨，新建和维修了众多的体育场以及各种服务设施，包括公路、立交桥、新闻中心、电视塔、机场、码头。
    巨额耗资如何拿回来？这是摆在东道国面前的一个实际问题。据报道，世界杯赛的宣传画构思巧妙，想象超拔，早已贴满大街小巷。
    由红白绿三色（意大利国旗色）积木拼成的儿童模型，作为世界杯赛“吉祥物”，早已家喻户晓。意大利风光旖旎，文物多彩，旅游业兴旺发达，每年旅游收益达100多亿美元。而明年历时一个月的“足球大战”以其特有的魅力和壮观，将吸引更多游客。许多饭店的预订部生意兴隆，大赛期间客满的招牌已经挂出。不少企业正在日夜赶制带有“吉祥物”和球星形象的衬衣、汗衫、手提包、笔记本、日历卡、纪念章。有的正在加班突击录制唱片、录音带、录像带、影片。国家印刷局也为制作多种邮票与金银币而忙得不亦乐乎。东道国意大利正是利用球迷如痴如醉的心理，加紧作好准备，为不久到来的体育盛会提供称心满意的服务和富有吸引力的物品，以赚取更多美元。
    “12赛城纪录片”，特聘12名著名导演摄制而成，耗资430万美元。导演中有贝尔托卢奇（摄制“末代皇帝”）和泽菲雷利（“茶花女”）。他们以新颖的构思和出类拔萃的电影艺术，将1990年世界杯赛12个城的风情与艺术展现在亿万观众面前。每部短片均为8分种，分别介绍12个赛城，在大赛期间公映。亿万球迷通过“电视世界转播”将首先领略赛城风姿，然后再看绿茵场上的拚搏。将艺术与足球完美融于一炉，东道国不仅宣传了本国的形象，而且还可得到几倍于430万美元的可观收入。共达96分钟的这部影片先在12月9日试播，这一天，国际足联与24强国足联领导人、著名球星、影星、歌星云集罗马，隆重举行抽签仪式。从此，十四届足球世界杯赛的进军号角正式吹响了。不难想象，伴随世界“足球热”的是东道国费煞苦心的“生意热”。
