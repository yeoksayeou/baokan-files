The mountainous regions of our country account for approximately two-thirds of the national territory. Correctly understanding these regions, developing them, and rapidly changing their backward appearance to improve the lives of the people in these areas are issues of great concern to the Party and the government, and they are urgent topics that require serious study and resolution. To explore this important issue, Xia Kewei has edited "Economics of China's Mountainous Regions," which has been published by the Dadi Press.

One of the distinctive features of this book is its rich and comprehensive content. It collects and studies a large amount of material related to mountainous regions, such as the basic concepts of mountains, mountain ranges, mountain systems, and mountainous regions, as well as the experiences and lessons learned from economic development in these areas. Compared to some previously published works on the economics of mountainous regions, this book is more systematic in its content. The book is divided into 5 parts, 14 chapters, and 53 sections, with an introduction and an appendix, covering almost all the current issues related to the economics of mountainous regions, such as the subject of economics of mountainous regions, the characteristics of mountainous regions, the development of mountainous resources, the development of transportation in mountainous regions, poverty alleviation and disaster relief in mountainous regions, and the planning and construction of mountainous regions, all of which are summarized and generalized to a certain extent. It can be said that this book is a guide to the development of the economy in mountainous regions and to helping these regions achieve prosperity, enabling cadres and the masses in mountainous regions to broaden their horizons, boost their spirits, and strengthen their sense of urgency and responsibility in developing mountainous regions. Even for those who are not from mountainous regions, they can gain knowledge about mountainous regions and understand the importance of developing the economy in these areas.

The research in "Economics of China's Mountainous Regions" adheres to the principle of combining theory with practice. The book starts from the specific economic situation of mountainous regions to determine the research object of China's economics of mountainous regions. It points out that the economics of mountainous regions is the study of the natural ecology, economic, and social development laws of mountainous regions with mountains as the main feature. It is a regional economics and an interdisciplinary science that combines natural and social sciences. Based on the research object, the authors determine the structure and tasks of the book, and based on the natural and economic characteristics of mountainous regions, they seek ways and methods for the development and utilization of mountainous resources, study the main regular problems encountered in the economic construction of mountainous regions, and explore how to use objective laws to build a good mountainous region. The book discusses the economy of mountainous regions from both a macro and a micro perspective, and has a certain practical value.

Mountainous regions in China are a large economic zone, accounting for one-sixth of the total area of mountainous regions worldwide. Countries such as Japan, Australia, the Philippines, Afghanistan, Nepal, and North Korea are all mountainous countries, with mountainous areas accounting for more than 50% of their national territory. The book focuses on the domestic situation while also looking at the global perspective. It learns from the experiences of foreign countries in developing mountainous regions and specifically writes a chapter titled "Learning from Foreign Experiences in the Development of Mountainous Resources," introducing and studying the development and utilization of mountainous resources, water and soil conservation and treatment measures in mountainous areas, mountainous research, and the mechanization of mountainous regions. This has reference significance for the development of the economy in China's mountainous regions.

    《中国山区经济学》简介
    徐国喜
    我国山区约占国土面积的三分之二，正确地认识山区，开发山区，迅速地改变山区的落后面貌，使山区人民生活进一步改善，是党和政府十分关注的一个问题，也是急待认真研究和妥善解决的课题。为了探索这个重要课题，肖克非主编的《中国山区经济学》已由大地出版社出版。
    本书的一个特色是内容比较丰富、全面。书中搜集和研究了有关山区的大量资料。例如关于山、山脉、山系、山区的基本概念，以及山区经济建设的经验和教训等。跟以前已经出版过的一些山区经济研究著作比较，该书的内容比较系统。全书共分5篇14章53节，外加绪论和附录，几乎囊括了目前有关山区经济问题的全部内容，如山区经济学的对象，山区特征，山区资源开发，山区交通发展，山区扶贫抗灾，山区规划建设等问题，都作了一定的概括总结。可以说，该书是引导山区经济发展，帮助山区脱贫致富的指南，可使山区的干部和群众开阔眼界，振奋精神，增强开发山区的紧迫感和责任感。就是对于非山区的人们，也可从中得到山区的知识，认识到发展山区经济的重要意义。
      《中国山区经济学》的研究，坚持了理论和实际相结合的原则。该书从山区具体经济情况出发，确定中国山区经济学研究的对象。指出山区经济学是研究以山为主要特征的山区的自然生态、经济和社会发展规律的经济科学。它是一门区域经济学，又是自然科学和社会科学交叉的边缘科学。作者根据研究的对象，确定本书的结构体系和任务，并以山区的自然特征和经济特征为依据，寻求山区资源开发利用的途径和方法，研究山区经济建设中遇到的主要的规律性问题，探讨如何运用客观规律建设好山区。全书对山区经济既有宏观的论述，又有具体的分析，有一定的实用价值。
    山区在中国是个大的经济区域，而且占全世界山区地域总面积的六分之一。如日本、澳大利亚、菲律宾、阿富汗、尼泊尔、朝鲜等都为多山国家，山地均占到国土面积的百分之五十或者更多。本书既着眼本国，又展望世界。借鉴国外开发山区的经验，专门撰写了一篇“国外山区资源开发经验借鉴”，对国外山区资源开发及利用途径，山地水土保持与治理措施，山地研究和山区机械化等问题，都进行了介绍研究，这对发展中国山区经济，是有借鉴意义的。
