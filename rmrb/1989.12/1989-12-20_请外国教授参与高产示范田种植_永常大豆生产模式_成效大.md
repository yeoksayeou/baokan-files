The "Yongchang Soybean Production Model" has gained significant attention in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province due to its low investment and high yield.

In 1988, with the help of relevant departments under the State Council and Heilongjiang Province, the Bayan County government invited Dr. Navziger, a soybean expert from the University of Illinois who was on vacation, to Yongchang Village in Bayan County. Together, they conducted high-yield demonstration field planting on 1,000 acres of soybeans. That year, they achieved an average yield of 201.75 kilograms per acre, which was 28.25 kilograms per acre more than the nearby non-demonstration high-yield fields, an increase of 16.3%. This yield reached the mid-to-high level of American soybean yields and was on par with the average single yield of soybeans in Illinois.

This year, they continued to demonstrate planting on 40,000 acres across 40 villages in the entire county. Despite facing multiple natural disasters such as droughts in the spring, summer, and autumn, the average yield per acre still reached 178.65 kilograms, nearly double the average yield per acre of conventional soybeans in the entire county. Relevant departments and experts from the State Council believe that this approach has found a breakthrough to change the current situation where China's soybean yield per acre is stagnant, demonstrating the enormous potential for soybean production in Heilongjiang Province and across the country.

This large-scale high-yield soybean planting method, which started from Yongchang Village, was named the "Yongchang Soybean Production Model" after being inspected and identified by soybean experts from the three northeastern provinces.

This model differs from traditional Chinese planting methods in many aspects, including seeds, fertilization, sowing, plant density, and management. Notably, it implements standardized cultivation techniques and integrates various technologies, which are not present in traditional methods. In August, 14 provinces held a soybean production on-site conference here. It is reported that China will use the "Yongchang Soybean Production Model" to plant 2 million acres of demonstration fields in the soybean-producing areas of the three northeastern provinces and the Yellow River, Huai River, and Hai River basins next year.

### 请外国教授参与高产示范田种植  “永常大豆生产模式”成效大

    请外国教授参与高产示范田种植
    “永常大豆生产模式”成效大
    本报哈尔滨12月19日电　记者武培真报道：“永常大豆生产模式”以其投入少成效大，最近在黑龙江省广大农村引起了强烈反响。
    1988年，巴彦县政府在国务院和黑龙江省有关部门的帮助下，将休假的美国大豆专家、伊利诺斯州大学教授纳夫兹格博士请到巴彦县永常村，共同进行千亩大豆高产示范田种植，当年实现平均亩产201.75公斤，比附近的非示范高产田每亩增产28.25公斤，提高16.3％。这个产量达到了美国大豆单产的中上等水平，与伊利诺斯州的大豆平均单产持平。
    今年，他们又在全县40个村安排4万亩继续示范种植，虽遇春夏秋大旱等多种自然灾害袭击，平均亩产却达到178.65公斤，比全县常规大豆平均亩产高近一倍。国务院有关部门和专家认为，这一做法为改变目前我国大豆单产水平徘徊不前的局面找到了突破口，展示了黑龙江省和全国大豆增产的巨大潜力。
    这一从永常村开始的大面积大豆高产的种植方法，经东北三省大豆专家们考察鉴定，被命名为“永常大豆生产模式”。
    这种模式与我国传统种植方法在种子、施肥、播种、株量和管理等诸方面有许多不同，尤其实施标准化栽培技术和将各项技术综合利用，是我国传统方法所不具备的。今年8月，14个省在这里召开大豆生产现场会。据悉，我国明年将在东北三省和黄河、淮河、海河流域大豆产区采用“永常大豆生产模式”种植200万亩示范田。
