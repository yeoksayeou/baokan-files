The "Foolish" Director

Xue Jingquan, Qiu Su

For over a decade, he has remained steadfast in his example, always taking Lei Feng as his model, and with the heart of an old Communist Party member, he has voluntarily treated patients without regard to time, place, or status. People affectionately call him the "Foolish" Director. He is Zhang Zhiming, the former deputy director of a certain hospital in the Jinan Military Region.

Zhang Zhiming is 59 years old this year and retired to the second line in 1987. However, he does not want to enjoy his retirement in comfort and instead silently contributes his remaining energy to the medical field. Since 1949, Zhang Zhiming has followed the Liu-Deng Army into the Southwest, and his silver needle has never left his pocket. Whether at home, in the park, on the bus, or while out on business, he is always "looking for trouble." He proactively asks, "Where does it hurt?" to those with unusual facial expressions or difficulty moving. Wherever there are patients, his figure appears. How many patients he has relieved of pain through his voluntary services, no one can say for sure. Someone said that he treats patients with a "foolish" spirit. He said, "When Lei Feng was alive, didn't he often do 'foolish' things?"

Over a decade ago, to save a child who had fallen into the river, he fearlessly jumped from a bridge over ten meters high into the river. The child was saved, but he fractured two ribs and his spine. A rural elderly person fell ill and had no money for treatment. Zhang Zhiming brought the elderly person home, providing food, lodging, and treatment. After the elderly person recovered, he escorted him back home.

This May, while out on business, Zhang Zhiming passed through the Yanwei Police District and encountered a crowd gathered around a scene. A patient had gone into respiratory arrest due to an allergic reaction to penicillin. Zhang Zhiming pushed his way to the front and immediately began resuscitation. When the patient's breathing returned to normal and their heartbeat stabilized, Zhang Zhiming quietly left.

This March, while riding a bus, Zhang Zhiming heard a woman beside him telling others that her mother had gallstones and that no medication could stop the pain. Zhang Zhiming said to the woman, "I am a doctor. Can I give your mother an acupuncture treatment?" The woman gratefully nodded. After a week of acupuncture treatments by Zhang Zhiming, the patient recovered. When they asked how much the medical fees were, Zhang Zhiming smiled and said, "No charge."

An elderly woman in her sixties at the Yantai Wholesale Department Store had cervical lymph node tuberculosis, with a pus-filled fistula in her neck that repeatedly flared up. She could not lift her shoulder or walk and had spent 2,800 yuan at other hospitals without improvement. Her family was very worried. Upon hearing the news, Zhang Zhiming rode his bicycle back and forth nearly ten miles, changing the patient's dressings and giving acupuncture treatments every other day, regardless of the weather. After more than six months of meticulous treatment, the patient's condition improved. Zhang Zhiming did not accept so much as a sip of water, a cigarette, or a penny from the patient. The patient's family was so moved that they wept. "In the past, we only heard about Lei Feng doing good deeds for the people. Today, we have seen a true Lei Feng!"

    “傻子”院长
    薛景全　邱苏
    他十几年如一日，时时以雷锋为榜样，以一位老共产党员的情怀，不分时间、不分地点、不分地位高低，义务为病人治病，人们都尊称他为“傻子”院长。他就是济南军区某医院原副院长张志敏。
    张志敏今年59岁，1987年退居二线。但他不愿坐享清福，在医疗事业上默默奉献余热。张志敏自1949年跟随刘邓大军进军大西南至今银针没离过口袋。不论在家、公园、公共汽车，还是外出办事，他总是“没事找事”。发现脸色不对的，行动困难的，他都主动询问“哪里不舒服”。听说哪里有病人，哪里就会出现他的身影。他义务为多少病人解除了痛苦，谁也说不清。有人说，他给病人治病有一股“傻劲”，他说，雷锋活着的时候，不也常做“傻事”吗？
    十几年前，他为了救一名落入河水里的儿童，不顾一切地从十米多高的桥上跳进河里。孩子得救了，而他却摔断了两根肋骨、腰椎骨折。一位乡下老人患病没钱治疗，张志敏把老人接到家里，管吃管住管治疗，老人病好后又把他护送到家。
    今年5月，张志敏外出办事途经烟威警务区时，遇到一个围观场面，是一名青霉素过敏的病人窒息了。张志敏挤到前面立即抢救。当病人呼吸恢复，心跳正常时张志敏悄悄地离开了。
    今年3月，张志敏乘坐公共汽车时，听到一位女同志在旁边与其他人讲，她母亲患胆石症，吃什么药也止不了痛。张志敏对那位女同志说：“我是医生，我给你母亲针灸一下好吗？”女同志感激地点点头。经过张志敏一个星期的针灸，病人康复了。当她们问需要多少医疗费时，张志敏笑笑说：“不要钱。”
    烟台百货批发站一位60多岁的老太太，患颈淋巴结核，颈部脓肿形成瘘管，反复发作，肩膀抬不起来，不能走路，在别的医院花了2800元钱也没好转，全家人非常着急。张志敏闻讯后，骑着自行车往返近十里路，隔日为病人换药、针灸，风雨无阻。经过他6个多月的精心治疗，病人病状减轻了。张志敏没喝病人一口水，没抽一支烟，没收一分钱。病人家属感动得直流泪。“过去我们只听说过雷锋为人民做好事，今天我们看到真雷锋了！”
