People's Daily, Chengdu, December 17th.

    The Jinjiang Hotel in Chengdu has adopted flexible management strategies to increase its room occupancy rate, achieving a profit of 10.22 million yuan in the first 11 months of this year.

    The Jinjiang Hotel, a three-star hotel with 1,005 beds, saw its occupancy rate drop to 30% in June due to the impact of the turmoil. To quickly turn around the situation, the hotel promptly formulated strategies such as "compensating for a lack of foreign guests with domestic guests, compensating for a lack of customers with commercial activities, and compensating for a lack of dining options with entertainment." The hotel actively contacted domestic and foreign travel agencies and invited foreign businessmen to visit Chengdu. Additionally, the hotel changed its previous policy of not accepting domestic guests during the peak travel season from May to October, opening its doors to domestic guests and lowering the single-bed rates to accommodate the domestic travel expense levels.

    Through these measures, the occupancy rate quickly rebounded, averaging over 85%. Meanwhile, the hotel focused on its commercial activities, vigorously promoting wholesale, agency sales, and door-to-door sales of local products.

    外宾不足内宾补　客源不足商贸补
    锦江宾馆经营有方
    本报成都12月17日电　记者罗茂城报道：成都锦江宾馆采取灵活经营措施，客房出租率不断提高，今年1—11月利润达1022万元。
    锦江宾馆是个拥有1005个床位的三星级宾馆，6月间由于受动乱影响，客床出租率降为30％。为了迅速扭转被动局面，宾馆及时制定“外宾不足内宾补，客源不足商贸补，餐厅不足娱乐补”等经营策略。主动与国内外旅行社客户联系，邀请外国客商到成都考察。此外，宾馆改变原来5—10月旅游旺季不接待内宾的作法，向内宾开放，并降低单床收费，以适应国内客人旅差费水平。
    通过这些措施，客源迅速回升，客房出租率平均达85％以上。同时，宾馆认真抓好商贸工作，大力开展批发、代销、上门推销地方产品等活动。
