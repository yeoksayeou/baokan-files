    Positive Changes in Hunan Universities: More Students Reading Marxism-Leninism
    People's Daily reports: According to the China Education News, in some universities in the past, Marxism-Leninism was considered by some students to be an "outdated theory," leading to what was called a "crisis of faith." Today, in the universities of Hunan after the turmoil, this situation has significantly changed.

    Liu Shuiyuan, the head of the student affairs department at Central South University of Technology, told reporters: "Now, the attendance rate for political theory classes is higher than ever. Students not only listen and take notes attentively during class, but they also gather around the teachers asking questions after class. Many classes have organized Marxism-Leninism study groups, and some departments have even initiated Marxism-Leninism speech competitions. The graduate student union is planning to establish a Marxism-Leninism reading room."

    This situation is not unique to Central South University of Technology. In Hunan University, Hunan Normal University, and Hunan University of Finance and Economics, the same trend is observed. The Communist Youth League branch of the Statistics Department at Hunan University of Finance and Economics has organized Marxism-Leninism philosophy study days, with every student eager to participate each week. Students not only borrow Marxism-Leninism books but also buy them. Xiao Pu, a student in the Finance Department's Class 862, introduced: "In our class of 30 students, 7 have bought 'Capital,' and I, in addition to buying 'Capital,' also had my father send me a set of 'Selected Works of Lenin.'"

    Where does the students' enthusiasm for studying Marxism-Leninism come from? Mao Xiaofeng, a student in the Industrial Foreign Trade major of the Economics and Management Department, Class 88, at Hunan University, revealed the truth: "After the turmoil, students reflected and felt that the biggest problem was a lack of theory. In high school, we studied politics just to pass exams. Now it seems that to build socialism well, one cannot do without a deep understanding of Marxism-Leninism. We have a greater sense of urgency." Since the beginning of the semester, Mao Xiaofeng has spent over 20 yuan to buy a set of "Selected Works of Marx and Lenin" and has read Marx's "The Communist Manifesto," Engels' "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and Deng Xiaoping's "The Communist Party Must Accept Supervision," among other works.

    From studying Marxism-Leninism to believing in it, university students' faith in the Communist Party and their pursuit of the truth of Marxism-Leninism have begun to return. Recently, the number of students applying to join the party has increased significantly in Hunan University of Finance and Economics, Central South University of Technology, Hunan Normal University, and Hunan University. In the Civil Engineering Department of Hunan University, 44 students have submitted party membership applications. Zhang Wenxing, a student in the Heating and Ventilation major, Class 86, wrote in his application: "After reflecting on the turmoil, I deeply feel that Marxism-Leninism is an unshakable truth. I want to dedicate everything to the magnificent cause of communism!"

### 湖南高校出现可喜变化  大学生读马列的又多了

    湖南高校出现可喜变化
    大学生读马列的又多了
    本报讯  据中国教育报报道：在昔日的某些高校，马列主义理论曾被一些大学生视为“过时的理论”，世人谓之“信仰危机”。今天，在动乱过后的湖南高校，这种局面明显改变。
    中南工业大学学生处长刘水源对记者说：现在政治理论课参加率比任何时候都高，学生上课不仅认真听，认真记，下课后还围着老师问个不休；很多班已组织起学习马列小组，有的系还自发开展学马列演讲比赛，研究生会正筹建马列阅览室。
    这种情况不独中南工业大学有。在湖南大学、湖南师范大学和湖南财经学院都如此。湖南财经学院计统系团总支开展马列主义哲学学习日活动，每周一个下午，系里的同学人人争着参加。学生们不仅借马列书，而且掏钱买马列书。该院金融系862班肖璞同学介绍：他们班30人中，有7人买了《资本论》，他自己除买了《资本论》外，还写信让他爸爸寄来了一套《列宁选集》。
    学生们学马列的热情从哪里来？湖南大学经管系工业外贸专业88级学生毛晓峰道出了真谛：“同学们动乱之后进行反思，感到最大的问题是理论上贫乏。在中学里我们学政治完全是应付考试。现在看来，要建设好社会主义，没有很深的马列理论修养不行，我们更要有紧迫感。”开学以来，毛晓峰花20多元买了一套《马列著作选读》，并通读了马克思的《共产党宣言》，恩格斯的《社会主义从空想到科学》，毛泽东的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，邓小平的《共产党要接受监督》等著作。
    由学马列而信马列，大学生们对共产党的信仰和对马列主义真理的追求开始回归。湖南财经学院、中南工业大学、湖南师大、湖南大学等高校，近来要求入党的学生人数大有增加。湖南大学土木系有44名学生递交了入党申请书，该系暖通专业86级学生张文星在申请中写道：“经过动乱的反思，我深切感到马列主义是颠扑不破的真理，我要把自己的一切献给共产主义的壮丽事业！”
