Chile's narrow terrain borders the Pacific Ocean, with a coastline of over 4,000 kilometers. How to mitigate or even avoid the disastrous consequences of tsunamis caused by earthquakes in the Pacific Ocean on coastal facilities and personnel has become an important task for Chilean earthquake workers. Currently, significant progress has been made in this area.

During Chile's economic development, there has been a tendency to locate industrial facilities, civilian buildings, and military defense structures along the coast, even in areas frequently affected by high tides. Such layouts have overlooked the potential damage that tsunamis can cause, drawing the attention of experts.

Historically, northern Chile and southern Peru are earthquake-prone areas. Earthquakes with epicenters at sea have caused large-scale tsunamis, affecting the entire Pacific coastline. On August 13, 1968, a tsunami generated by an estimated magnitude 8.5 earthquake reached the African coast, with waves as high as 14 to 21 meters. A U.S. Navy warship was dragged 300 meters inland by the waves. The tsunami that struck the Chilean coast in 1960, although forecasted a few hours in advance, still resulted in $550 million in damages. Additionally, it caused $75 million in damages in Hawaii and $50 million in Japan, with a total of 260 deaths in both locations. However, the earthquakes that occurred in 1967 and 1987 did not trigger tsunamis. Scientists have analyzed that the occurrence of tsunamis may have some periodicity, and the new cycle of tsunami occurrence is approaching.

Geologists at the University of Antofagasta in northern Chile are accelerating their research efforts. They are developing a computer monitoring system for early tsunami warnings to alert coastal residents of impending catastrophic tsunamis in the shortest possible time. The university has installed earthquake triggers in areas prone to magnitude 6.5 earthquakes. In the northern desert region, these instruments are arranged in a network. The computer center receives data from various locations via microwave and processes it immediately. Tide gauges are installed for different coastal segments, connected via microwave lines, allowing the computer center to observe abnormal tidal conditions when a tsunami occurs. In the event of a strong earthquake, it can confirm and forecast the tsunami. Another goal of this plan is to minimize the loss of personnel and property along the coast during a tsunami. To this end, they have studied geological statistics and mathematical models for the relevant areas. The university's engineering department has provided technical assistance to large enterprises in the northern coastal region to take necessary preventive measures.

Experts believe that through deep-sea measurements, rapid distance determination, and wave energy analysis, it is possible to determine the theoretical maximum tidal height for certain coastal areas. Statistical data can be plotted on a plane and tidal curves, from which the locations of high tides and the possible height of waves can be inferred. Relying on these data and mathematical analysis, as well as other technical means, tsunamis can be forecasted in advance to reduce the damage caused by tsunamis.

    智利预测海啸取得进展
    智利地形狭长，濒临太平洋，海岸线四千多公里。如何减轻以至避免在太平洋中发生地震时出现的海啸对沿岸地区的设施及人员造成的灾难性后果，成为智利地震工作者一项重要的任务。目前，这项工作已取得一定的进展。
    在智利发展经济的过程中，人们倾向于把一些工业设施、民用建筑及军事防御机构安置在沿海地区，甚至常有高潮的地带。这样的布局忽视了海啸可能带来的损害，引起专家们的关注。
    在历史上，智利北部和秘鲁南部是地震多发区，震中在海里的地震造成大规模的海啸，波及整个太平洋沿岸。一九六八年八月十三日，一场估计为里氏八点五级大地震掀起的海啸冲击到非洲海岸，海浪高达十四至二十一米。美国海军的一艘战舰被海浪拖进陆地三百米。一九六零年在智利海岸发生的大海啸，虽然提前几小时作了预报，仍造成五点五亿美元的损失。此外，在夏威夷造成七千五百万美元损失，在日本损失五千万美元，两地共二百六十人死亡。可是，一九六七年和一九八七年发生的两次海上地震没有引发海啸，科学家们分析海啸的发生可能有某种周期性，现在离发生海啸的新周期已经临近。
    智利北部安托法加斯塔大学的地质学家们正加紧开展研究工作。他们将建立一个提早预报海啸的计算机监测系统，以便在最短时间内向沿海地区的居民提醒将要发生的灾难性海啸的情况。这所大学制作的地震触发器安放在可能发生里氏六点五级地震的海区。同时在北部的沙漠地带，以网状的形式安置这种仪器。计算机中心通过微波接受各地传回的资料，并立即处理。为沿海不同地段的设施装上检潮器，用微波线路相联结，这样在计算机中心可以观察到海啸出现时海潮的非正常状况，在发生强烈地震的情况下，能够确认和预报海啸。这项计划的另一个目的是发生海啸时，尽量减少沿海人员和物资的损失。为此，他们已对有关地区的地质统计资料和数学模式进行研究。这所大学的工程系已为北部沿海地区的大型企业提供技术援助，采取应有的预防措施。
    专家们认为，通过海洋深测，准距快速测定及海浪的能量分析，有可能确定一定的海岸地区理论上最大的海潮高度，将统计数字绘成平面图及海潮曲线图，由此推断出现高潮的地点及海浪可能达到的高度。依靠这些数字和数学分析及其他技术手段的帮助，提前预报海啸，减少海啸造成的损失。
