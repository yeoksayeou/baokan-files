In Wuhan's Central South Nationalities University, reporters saw notices and study content related to "Party Constitution Study Groups" posted in student dormitories, classrooms, and bulletin boards. It is understood that there are more than 40 such study groups across the 11 departments of the university. Recently, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Isa Yamaevich Aymati, expressed his satisfaction during an inspection visit here.

The university, established 38 years ago, has over 3,500 students. After the spring and summer disturbances this year, the party organizations at various levels actively guided students to receive political education. The students shed their mental burdens and launched a wave of serious study of the history of the Communist Party of China, basic party knowledge, philosophy, social sciences, and Marxist theoretical courses. The "Party Constitution Study Groups" emerged in this atmosphere.

To help students improve their Marxist theoretical and ideological levels, since the second half of this year, the school's party and youth league organizations have used various forms such as spare-time party schools, spare-time youth league schools, and lecture series to educate students on Marxism-Leninism theory and basic party knowledge. The Computer Science Department's party branch of the university took the lead in promoting the experience of Party Constitution Study Groups. In this department of 200 students, 30% have submitted applications to join the party, indicating their thoughts and aspirations. Lei Wei, a student from the Zhejiang She ethnic group in the Law Department, actively communicated with some classmates who had participated in protests after joining the Party Constitution Study Group, doing ideological and political work. He shared how the disturbances had strengthened his belief and pursuit of the Party, inspiring many classmates. The Law Department recently also received a certificate of merit from his hometown, praising him for his active social practice activities during the summer vacation, where he did a lot of ideological and political work for the society.

Since the establishment of the Party Constitution Study Groups by students, Marxist-Leninist theory and party courses have become unprecedentedly popular across the university. Previously, it was "I am told to learn," but now it is "I want to learn." A new atmosphere of voluntarily cleaning, helping others, and voluntary labor has emerged.

Today, six undergraduate students and one graduate student from Fudan University stood under the red party flag and solemnly pledged: "I voluntarily join the Communist Party of China." They are the first batch of student party members developed in Shanghai universities after the turmoil subsided.

These seven new party members have long paid attention to their political cultivation and consciously accepted the party's education. During the spring and summer disturbances, they stood firmly with the party. News and Communication eight-six class student Liang Hong, since March, along with a few other classmates, formed the "Future Journalists South Expedition Team" to go south for an investigation. When the turmoil occurred, someone incited them to go to Beijing to support the student movement, but they remained unmoved and insisted on going to the grassroots. On May 20, Liang Hong wrote an application to join the party at the tomb of the martyrs of Old Mountain.

The school party committee paid special attention to the requirements of these young people with passion for the party, arranging for them and dozens of other students who requested to join the party to participate in the 12th session of the student spare-time party school for study, and conducted a comprehensive investigation. Based on fully listening to public opinions, after discussion and approval by the grassroots party organizations, the party committee approved the seven students to join the party.

    中南民院涌现一批学习党章小组
    复旦大学吸收七名优秀学生入党
    新华社武汉12月9日电　（记者方政军）在武汉中南民族学院，记者看到学生宿舍、教室外、阅报栏都贴有“党章学习小组”的有关通知和学习内容。据了解，全院11个系已有党章学习小组40多个。全国政协副主席司马义·艾买提前不久来这里视察时对此十分满意。
    建院38年的中南民族学院共有3500多名学生，今年春夏发生动乱以后，院系党组织积极引导学生进行政治教育补课。大学生们丢掉思想包袱，掀起了认真学习中共党史、党的基本知识、哲学、社会科学和马克思主义理论课的热潮，课余“党章学习小组”在这种空气中应运而生。
    为了帮助学生提高马克思主义思想理论水平，今年下半年以来，学校党团组织利用课余党校、业余团校、系列讲座等多种形式，向学生进行马列主义理论和党的基础知识教育。民院计算机科学系学生党支部率先推广了党章学习小组的经验，这个系200名大学生已有30％的同学向党组织递交了入党申请书，表明了他们的思想及追求。政法系浙江籍畲族学生雷炜参加党章学习小组后，主动跟少数参加过游行的同学谈心，做思想政治工作，讲述通过动乱自己在理性和感情上更加坚定了对党的信念和追求，使不少同学受到启发。政法系最近还收到他的家乡寄来的“社会实践活动积极分子”奖状，表扬他暑假回家为社会作了很多思想政治工作。
    据介绍，大学生自发成立党章学习小组以来，全院马列理论和党课教育课空前受欢迎，过去是“要我学”，现在是“我要学”，出现了自觉打扫卫生、助人为乐、义务劳动的新气象。
    本报上海12月8日电　记者萧关根报道：今天，复旦大学6名大学生和1名研究生站在鲜红的党旗下庄严宣誓：“我志愿加入中国共产党。”他们是学潮平息后，在上海高校中发展的第一批学生党员。
    这7位新党员长期以来一直比较注意自身的政治修养，自觉接受党的教育。在今年春夏之交的动乱中，他们坚定地与党站在一起。新闻系八六级学生梁泓，自3月份起和其他几位同学组成“未来记者南疆考察团”赴南方考察。动乱发生后，有人鼓动他们赴北京声援学潮，但他们不为所动，坚持走向基层。5月20日，梁泓在老山烈士墓地写下了入党申请书。
    学校党委对这些热血青年的要求特别重视，安排他们和其他几十位要求入党的学生参加了第12期学生业余党校学习，并对他们进行全面考察。在充分听取群众意见的基础上，经基层党组织讨论通过，党委批准了7位学生入党。
