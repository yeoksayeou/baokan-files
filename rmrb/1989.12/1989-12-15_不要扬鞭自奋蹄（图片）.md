The image is a political cartoon by the renowned Chinese cartoonist Huajunwu, published in the People's Daily on December 15, 1989. The cartoon depicts a horse with a whip in its own mouth, whipping itself to gallop forward. The phrase "不要扬鞭自奋蹄" translates to "Don't whip yourself to gallop," which metaphorically suggests that one should not push oneself too hard or force progress in an unnatural or unsustainable way.

The cartoon was published in the context of the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a period of significant political and social turmoil in China. The image serves as a commentary on the need for self-reflection and moderation, urging individuals and the nation to avoid excessive self-flagellation and to strive for balanced and sustainable development.
