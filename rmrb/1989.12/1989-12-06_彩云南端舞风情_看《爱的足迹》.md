Recently, Yunnan Province presented a gala performance titled "Footprints of Love." My hometown is renowned for its beauty and mystery; watching the dances in this performance also gave me a sense of beauty and mystery.

I seem to hear footsteps, walking from ancient times to the present; my heart beats in rhythm, sometimes tightening, sometimes relaxing, sometimes thrilling... This is a performance of songs and dances depicting the marriages and love affairs of Yunnan's ethnic minorities. Just from the titles listed on the program—such as "Gourd Marriage," "Walking Marriage," "Night Marriage," "Dream Marriage," "Lost Marriage," and "Crying Marriage"—one can already be captivated. The music composed by musician Tian Feng serves as the overall conception and blueprint for this large-scale song and dance performance. Following the undulating rhythm of the structure, with songs interwoven with dances and dances interwoven with songs, various segments are sketched out, incorporating elements of tragedy, comedy, farce, and melodrama. "The Joy of Love" is based on the shoulder movements from the Yi people's folk dance "Singing and Dancing," but the actions and shapes are endlessly varied and ever-changing, thus the dance conveys the heat of the bonfire, the sweetness of the moonlight, and the lingering mist of the morning. The duet "Night Marriage" is a poem of motion; the success of this segment lies in its embodiment of music—not just dancing to the music, but dancing the music. The emotions expressed in the dance also make the "lifting" form, which is foreign in origin, feel natural and unforced. "Dream Marriage" and "Lost Marriage" are contrasting in tone, the former evoking tears and the latter inducing laughter, and it is rare for a dance to achieve such effects. Especially noteworthy is how the directors and performers are imbued with the emotions of their ethnicities; it is precisely because of their love for ethnic art that they have brought the dances to life and performed them vividly.

This is a pioneering work that breaks through traditional artistic models in expressing emotions, creating atmosphere, and elevating thematic ideas, expanding the expressive power of dance and music, yet without weakening the rhythm, beauty, and style of ethnic art; instead, these elements have been strengthened. "Footprints of Love" is also a historical journey. Through the depiction of various marriage customs, it reveals the development of different social forms, and regardless of the circumstances or encounters, it collectively showcases the steadfast and pure love of various ethnicities, which is the theme that inspires and purifies the soul.

    彩云南端舞风情
    ——看《爱的足迹》
    杨丽萍
    最近，云南省推出了一台晚会《爱的足迹》。我的家乡素有美丽神奇的称誉；我看这台晚会里的舞蹈，也同样有美丽神奇的感受。
    我仿佛听到一种脚步声，从远古走向现在；心也随着跳动，时而紧缩，时而放松，时而是惊心动魄……这是一台表现云南民族婚恋的歌舞，仅从节目单上印有的葫芦婚、走婚、夜婚、梦婚、丢婚、哭婚等一串婚俗的名称，已经够吸引人了。音乐家田丰所谱写的音乐是这部大型歌舞的整体构思和蓝本。随着结构线的起伏跌宕，在歌中有舞、舞中有歌、歌舞交织的基础上，勾出具有正剧、喜剧、悲剧、闹剧等成分的多种情调、多种色彩的段落。《爱的狂欢》是以彝族民间舞“打歌”里的肩部扭动为元素，但动作和图形的发展变化莫测，层出不穷，于是舞蹈跳出了篝火的炽热、月夜的甜美、晨雾的依恋。双人舞《夜婚》是一首动作的诗，这段舞的成功在于体现了音乐——不仅是随着音乐跳舞，而是跳音乐。舞蹈中抒发的绵绵情意也把“托举”这种外来形式化得并不“夹生”了。《梦婚》和《丢婚》则一悲一喜，前者催人欲泪，后者令人忍俊不禁，舞蹈能收到如此效果是难能可贵的。特别是编导们和演员们浑身都像浸透了民族的情感，正是基于对民族艺术的热爱，他们把舞编“活”了，也跳“活”了。
    这是一部开拓型的作品，在表现情感、创造氛围、升华主题思想上，突破了传统艺术的模式，扩大了舞蹈与音乐的表现力，但民族艺术的韵律、美感、风格并没有被削弱，反而得到了强化。《爱的足迹》也是历史的足迹。通过不同婚俗的表现，透视出不同社会形态的发展，而无论在任何境况下，在任何遭遇中，又共同显示了各个民族爱情的坚贞、纯洁，这正是激发、净化人的心灵的主题。
