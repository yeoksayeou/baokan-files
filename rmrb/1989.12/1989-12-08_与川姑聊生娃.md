"Having only one child, what's wrong with that?" Sichuan woman Dong Yulan tilted her head, blushing but firmly retorted, which made the reporter feel somewhat surprised. A six-month-old baby was peacefully blinking in her arms.

Rushing to get pregnant, exceeding the birth limit, giving birth secretly, hiding pregnancies... these have formed an unstoppable disaster in some parts of China's rural areas. However, the reporter recently traveled from the Sichuan Basin to the northern mountainous region and encountered a different mindset among farmers.

In Qingcheng Township, Xianhua Village, Dujiangyan City, we chatted casually with farmer Dong Yulan at her home: Would having only one child result in a lack of labor in the future?

Dong Yulan said: "In the past, in my mother's family, there were four siblings, plenty of labor, but we went hungry every year. After getting married, I was still a poor household. Thanks to the government's good policies, my husband and I work in the fields during the busy season and go out to work during the off-season. Last year, we earned 2,000 yuan and got out of poverty. I believe that the country's family planning policy is for the benefit of farmers."

In the Daba Mountains, farmer Li Guilan, while brewing tea over the stove, said: "The family planning policy is indeed good. Having too many children is unaffordable."

The reporter, pointing to her three children, joked: "Are you just saying that because you've had enough?" Li Guilan got upset and counted on her fingers: "Children need to go to school, get medical treatment when sick, and get married when grown up. Which part doesn't cost money? You talk about having children to support old age? Look at my husband, with five brothers, none of them can afford to take good care of the elderly. The most dilapidated house in the courtyard is where the elderly live."

Li Guilan's county, Wangcang, is a well-known poverty-stricken county in Sichuan. In recent years, the local government has explored a new approach combining poverty alleviation with family planning, which has begun to change farmers' childbearing concepts.

Many women have expressed: We support the family planning policy, and we also want to live a better life, but there are difficulties in having fewer children.

Lu Ying experienced such a painful choice.

She is a farmer from Gaoping Township, Guanghan City, and now runs a down jacket factory with her husband, with an annual output value of over 2 million yuan. When her family went from poverty to wealth, her mother-in-law nagged: "One granddaughter is too lonely, and since we have money now, we can afford to have another child."

Lu Ying also wanted to have another boy, but she thought, "The family is rich, relying on everyone; the country is in trouble, we should repay the kindness."

She persuaded her mother-in-law and husband to focus on educating their daughter well. Now, their down jacket products have entered the international market, and their 10-year-old daughter is diligent, intelligent, and lively.

Facing the severe shortage of talent in rural areas, 24-year-old He Meiyu has an aspiration: to become a teacher who imparts knowledge.

This elegant and beautiful young woman has been a contract teacher for 6 years. Her current goal is to pass the teacher's qualification exam and become a qualified teacher.

However, the price she paid for this is that she did not have a child for two years after marriage, which led to neighbors' ridicule and her mother-in-law's constant complaints.

She blinked her bright eyes and said: "Sometimes, when I see other people's lively children, I can't help but feel a sense of loneliness. But we can't have burdens, we can't give up our struggle."

Having fewer children or more children, rural women in China are making painful choices; however, when farmers link their family interests with the country's future, China's future will have hope.

    与川姑聊生娃
    新华社记者　杜新　于长洪
    “只养一个，有什么不好？”川姑董玉兰歪着头羞涩但肯定地反诘，很让记者感到几分惊异。六个月大的娃娃在她怀里安谧地眨巴眼睛。
    抢孕、超生、偷生、躲生……正在中国部分农村形成难以遏止的灾难性大潮。而记者前不久从川西平原到川北山区，却接触到农民的另一种心态。
    在都江堰市青城乡香花村，我们在农民董玉兰家中闲聊：只养一个娃，将来会不会缺劳力？
    董玉兰说：“原先在娘家，有姐弟4人，劳力不少，可年年断粮。过门了，我还是个贫困户。靠政府的好政策，我和丈夫农忙种田，农闲外出打工，去年收入2000元，脱贫了。我相信国家讲计划生育是为农民着想的。”
    在大巴山区，农民李桂兰边在火炉上煨茶边说：“计划生育政策正经好，养多了供不起。”
    记者指着她的3个孩子打趣：你是不是生够了讲大话？李桂兰急了，扳着指头说：“孩子要读书，病了要上医院，大了要婚嫁，哪样不花钱？你讲养儿防老？你看我丈夫，大小五兄弟，谁也没能力供养好两老。院子当中最破烂的土房就是老人住的。”
    李桂兰所在的旺苍县是四川有名的贫困县。这几年，当地政府探索扶贫与计划生育相结合的新路子，促使农民的生育观念开始发生变化。
    不少妇女表白：计划生育政策我们是拥护的，我们也想把日子过得好一些，但真的要我们少生，难处也多。
    罗英就经历了这样一种痛苦的抉择。
    她是广汉市高坪镇农民，现在和丈夫经营一家年产值达200多万元的羽绒厂。当她家由穷变富，婆婆唠叨：一个孙女太孤单，反正有钱了，再养一个也罚得起。
    罗英何尝不想多添一个男娃？但她又想，小家富了，靠着大家；国家有难，知恩当报。
    她和丈夫说通婆婆，集中精力教育好女孩。现在，他们的羽绒产品已打入国际市场，而10岁的女儿，学习勤奋，聪明伶俐。
    面对农村人才严重匮缺的状况，24岁的何美玉有一种追求：要当一名传授知识的教师。
    这位端庄秀丽的姑娘当民办教师已6年，她现在的目标是考取中师，做名合格的人民教师。
    然而她为此付出的代价是，婚后两年没养娃，引得四邻取笑，婆婆怨声不断。
    她忽闪着明眸说：“有时看到别人活蹦乱跳的孩子，自己心里不免浮起一种孤独感。但我们不能有拖累，不能放弃奋斗。”
    少生或多生，中国农村妇女在作痛苦的选择；然而当农民把小家利益和国家前途相联系，中国的未来便有了希望。
