1990: Situation and Strategy

Xinhua News Agency

"Only a few days remain in this year, and the overall situation in agriculture is settled. At this moment, as the minister of agriculture in our great agricultural country, how do you feel?"

Minister He Kang probably didn't expect the interview to start this way. After a moment of thought, he responded in a clear voice, "Looking back at the past year, I feel gratified; looking ahead to the upcoming 1990, I feel a great sense of responsibility. I can say it's a mix of joy and worry, not at all easy!" After a brief pause, he waved his hand and continued, "We have confidence in achieving new breakthroughs in agriculture next year!"

"As is known, the recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee placed great emphasis on agricultural issues. It stressed that achieving stable development in agriculture is the foundation for economic stability, political stability, and social stability, and is also the key to adjusting the economic structure. The central government attaches so much importance to agriculture, which is a strong tailwind for agriculture."

"In fact, agriculture's 'warming up' began in the second half of last year," Minister He Kang said when discussing the agricultural situation this year. "After the Central Rural Work Conference, various levels of party committees and governments seriously implemented the central government's decision to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture, strengthened leadership over agriculture, increased investment in agriculture, and took some practical and effective measures, especially for agriculture and grain production. Coupled with the fact that most parts of the country had good climatic conditions, the total grain production this year reached over 400 billion kilograms, approaching the historical highest level. Other rural industries also developed to varying degrees. The overall rural economic situation is good. Here, I would like to thank the leaders at all levels, the agricultural officials, and especially the farmers who have worked hard for a year!"

What are the main tasks for agriculture in 1990? Minister He said, "In a nutshell, it's one sentence: Achieve a new bumper harvest in agriculture, especially in grain and cotton. The most important planned indicators are: increase grain production by 7.5 billion kilograms, surpassing the historical highest level; increase cotton production by 80 million piculs. This means that production capacity needs to have new breakthroughs."

Can this breakthrough be achieved?

"I believe there are conditions to achieve it. The key is to have a clear guiding ideology and implement measures."

Minister He said, "The guiding ideology for achieving the agricultural production plan next year is: while striving to achieve a bumper harvest in grain and cotton, strive for a balanced increase in major economic crops such as oil and sugar, and continue the stable growth of livestock, fisheries, state farms, and township enterprises."

How to focus on these two key areas of grain and cotton? Minister He summarized it as "three stabilizations and improvements, three main attacks," that is: expand the planting area, increase the yield per unit area, and on the basis of stabilizing and improving the production areas that increased this year, focus on the areas that decreased; stabilize and improve the summer grain in the north, focus on the south; stabilize and improve the autumn grain in the south, focus on the north. When talking about specific measures, Minister He believed that the main points are:

	* Deepen planning guidance and increase the planting area of grain and cotton. Grain should increase by 100-150 million mu, and cotton by 60 million mu. Increasing the area mainly relies on improving the replanting index, developing grain-cotton, grain-grain intercropping and relay cropping, developing winter fallow fields in the south, and expanding regenerated rice, etc.
	* Promote various practical yield-increasing technologies and strive to improve the yield per unit area. Next year, the plan is to plant 2.3 billion mu of hybrid rice, an increase of 300 million mu compared to this year; plant 2.8 billion mu of hybrid corn, an increase of 100 million mu compared to this year; apply formula fertilization to 5.2 billion mu, an increase of 400 million mu compared to this year; apply model cultivation technology to 600 million mu.

	In order to implement these technical measures, we must vigorously promote the "group contract" and other forms of technical contract responsibility system, and expand the scale of the "Harvest Plan." On the basis of the significant results achieved in the "100 Million Mu Corn Harvest Plan" implemented this year, next year, the "100 Million Mu Wheat Harvest Plan" will be implemented in the Huanghuaihai region, and the "100 Million Mu Rice Harvest Plan" will be implemented in the south, striving to increase the yield per mu by 25 kilograms and 50 kilograms respectively in three years. In Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the "10 Million Mu Wheat-Cotton Intercropping Harvest Plan" will be implemented. In addition, we will also focus on the development of "10 Million Mu High-Yield Fields," "10 Million Mu Regenerated Rice," and "10 Million Mu Plastic Film Covered Corn."

	* Strengthen the construction of agricultural infrastructure and commercial bases. The situation of agricultural water conservancy construction this winter is very good, and next year we will continue to maintain this momentum. We will combine agricultural comprehensive development to focus on infrastructure, especially the construction of technology promotion and seed systems. For the 254 commercial grain base counties and 74 high-quality grain and cotton base counties that the state has built and is building in recent years, we will strengthen management and consolidate and improve them. At the same time, next year we will build a new batch of commercial base counties.

Minister He emphasized, "Agriculture must go up, cadres must go down. All levels should organize cadres to go to the countryside, divide areas and points, and combine policy interpretation with technical guidance, combine point support with technical contracts, and combine poverty alleviation with increased production and income. Our Ministry of Agriculture must take the lead. We will organize a large number of cadres from the headquarters and direct units to go to the front line of the countryside."

After discussing the specific ideas of the Ministry of Agriculture, Minister He specially instructed the reporter to express the Ministry of Agriculture's gratitude through the newspaper to the comrades from various departments and industries who have cared for and supported agriculture in the past year. And hope that everyone will, as before, provide more support to agriculture in the coming year in terms of funds, materials, technology, etc. Work together to ensure new breakthroughs in agriculture.

1990 is just around the corner. Next year is a crucial year for rectification and deepening reform. At this time of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, we are launching the "1990: Situation and Strategy" column, which will successively publish interviews or articles from some departments, local leaders, experts, and people from all walks of life, looking ahead to the next year, analyzing the economic situation, and proposing practical strategies. This will help everyone correctly grasp the situation, enhance confidence, and truly implement various tasks, and achieve new victories in the new year under the inspiration of the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee!

    力争农业新突破
    ——访农业部部长何康
    本报记者　吴长生
    “今年只剩下最后几天，农业大局已定。此时此刻，您作为咱们这个农业大国的农业部长，心情怎样？”
    何康部长大概没想到记者的采访会这样开头。他略加思索，语音爽朗地答道：“回顾过去的一年，感到欣慰；展望即将来临的1990年，深感责任重大，可以说是有喜有忧，并不轻松啊！”稍稍停顿之后，他手一挥，接着说：“争取明年农业的新突破，我们有信心！”
    “众所周知，前不久召开的十三届五中全会，非常重视农业问题。强调实现农业的稳定发展，是经济稳定、政治稳定和社会稳定的基础，也是调整经济结构的关键所在。中央如此看重农业，对农业来说，是一股强劲的东风。”
    “其实，农业的‘升温’是从去年下半年开始的。”何康同志谈到今年农业形势时这样说：“由于各级党委和政府在中央农村工作会议后，认真贯彻中央关于夺取农业丰收的决定，加强了对农业的领导，增加了对农业的投入，并对农业特别是粮食生产，采取了一些切实有力的措施，加之全国多数地方气候条件较好，今年粮食总产达到4000多亿公斤，接近历史最高水平。其他农村各业也有不同程度的发展。整个农村经济形势是好的。在这里，我要感谢各级领导，感谢广大农口的干部，特别是辛勤劳作了一年的农民兄弟！”
    1990年农业的主要任务是什么呢？何部长说：“扼要讲，就是一句话：夺取农业特别是粮棉新丰收。最重要的计划指标是：粮食增产75亿公斤，超历史最高水平；棉花增产800万担。这意味着生产能力要有新的突破。”
    能否实现这种突破呢？
    “我认为有条件实现。关键是指导思想要明确，措施要落实。”
    何康说：“实现明年农业生产计划的指导思想是：在奋力夺取粮棉丰收的前提下，争取油料、糖料等大宗经济作物均衡增产，畜牧、水产、农垦、乡镇企业继续稳定增长。”
    怎样突出粮棉这两个重点？何部长概括为“三稳定提高、三主攻”，即：扩大种植面积，提高单产，在稳定和提高今年增产地区的基础上，主攻减产地区；夏粮稳定、提高北方，主攻南方；秋粮稳定、提高南方，主攻北方。谈到具体措施，何康认为主要得抓这么几条：
    ——加深计划指导，增加粮棉播种面积。粮食要增加1000万—1500万亩，棉花增加600万亩。增加面积主要靠提高复种指数，发展粮棉，粮粮间作套种、开发南方冬闲田和扩大再生稻等。
    ——推广各种实用增产技术，努力提高单产。明年计划种杂交水稻2.3亿亩，比今年增加3000万亩；种杂交玉米2.8亿亩，比今年增加1000万亩；配方施肥面积5.2亿亩，比今年增加4000万亩；模式化栽培技术面积6000万亩。
  　为了落实这些技术措施，要大力推行“集团承包”和其他多种形式的技术承包责任制，扩大“丰收计划”的规模。在今年实施的“亿亩玉米亩增50公斤丰收计划”取得显著成效的基础上，明年在黄淮海地区实施“亿亩小麦丰收计划”，在南方实施“亿亩水稻丰收计划”，争取3年亩产分别增加25公斤和50公斤。在冀鲁豫要实施“1000万亩麦棉套种丰收计划”。此外还要抓好“1000万亩吨粮田”、“1000万亩再生稻”和“1000万亩地膜覆盖玉米”的开发。
    ——加强农业基础设施和商品基地建设。今冬各地农田水利建设形势很好，明年要继续保持这种势头。要结合农业综合开发抓好基础设施，尤其是加强技术推广体系和良种体系建设。对国家近年来已建和在建的254个商品粮基地县和74个优质粮棉基地县，要加强管理，巩固提高。同时，明年再兴建一批商品基地县。
    何部长强调，“农业要上去，干部要下去。各级都要组织干部下乡，分片定点，作到宣讲政策和指导技术相结合，蹲点包片与技术承包相结合，扶贫治穷和增产增收相结合。我们农业部更要带好头，我们将从机关和直属单位组织一大批干部下到农村第一线。”
    谈完农业部的具体想法之后，何康部长特别嘱咐记者，通过报纸向在过去一年里关心、支援农业的各部门、各行业的同志们转达农业部的谢意。并希望大家在未来的一年中，一如既往地从资金、物资、科技等方面给农业以更大的支持。齐心协力，确保农业的新突破。
    1990年就要到来了。明年是治理整顿和深化改革的关键性一年。在这辞旧迎新之际，我们开辟“1990：形势与对策”专栏，将陆续发表一些部门、地方负责人、专家和各方面人士的专访或文章，展望未来一年，分析经济形势，提出切实对策。这样将有助于大家正确把握形势，增强信心，并把各项工作真正落到实处，在党的十三届五中全会精神鼓舞下，在新的一年夺取新的胜利！
