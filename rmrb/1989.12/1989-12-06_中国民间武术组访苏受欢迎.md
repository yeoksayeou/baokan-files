The first Chinese folk martial arts group to visit the Soviet Union has returned to Beijing. They were enthusiastically welcomed in Moscow, playing an active role in promoting martial arts.

The Chinese folk martial arts group performed six shows in Moscow, conducted five joint training sessions, and many spectators braved the snow to watch the performances. The group showcased various martial arts skills, including fist techniques, swordplay, spear techniques, and broadsword. Renowned martial arts coach Wu Bin also joined the team on stage, demonstrating his prowess in striking and sword dancing. The highly skilled Wang Mancheng not only performed brilliantly but also cured several difficult ailments for many Soviet citizens, earning their respect.

Deputy Chairman of the All-Soviet Sports Committee, Korensov, received the leader of the folk martial arts group, Jiang Yumin, and all the members. Korensov happily said: "Your visit was very successful. Whether we like it or not, the people want us to engage in martial arts." He mentioned that the All-Soviet Union will establish a martial arts association, overseen by the Director of the Gymnastics Bureau, Agayev, with 15 republics sending representatives to the preparatory meeting.

When the Chinese folk martial arts group concluded their visit to the Soviet Union, many martial arts enthusiasts came to the hotel to see them off, reluctant to part. They hoped that the martial arts group would visit again.

    中国民间武术组访苏受欢迎
    本报讯　出访苏联的中国第一个民间武术组已经回到北京。他们在莫斯科受到热烈的欢迎，对于推广武术起到积极的作用。
    中国民间武术组在莫斯科表演了6场，共同训练5次，许多观众冒着大雪到体育馆看表演。民间武术组向他们表演了拳术、刀术、枪术和剑等武艺。著名武术教练吴彬也和队员一起上台击拳舞刀。技艺高超的王满成不仅表演出色，他还给不少苏联人治愈了疑难病症，受到尊重。
    全苏体委副主任柯连索夫接见了民间武术组组长姜玉民和全体成员。柯连索夫高兴地说：你们的访问很成功，不管我们愿意不愿意，人民也要我们搞武术。他说，全苏要成立武术协会，由体操局局长阿加叶夫总管，15个加盟共和国将派人参加筹备会。
    当中国民间武术组结束访苏时，许多武术爱好者到旅馆送行，依依不舍，他们希望武术组再次访苏。　（范鸿贤）
