In 1978, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council decided to build a shelterbelt forest system in the three northern regions (Northwest, North China, and Northeast) of China, and listed this project as one of the key national economic construction projects. The construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is a fundamental measure to change the ecological environment of half of China's territory, to establish forest reserves for the country, and to protect the land, increase land productivity, and ensure and promote the stable increase of agricultural and pastoral production. It is a major event directly related to the poverty alleviation and prosperity of 33 ethnic groups and 130 million people in the Three-North region. Over the past decade, the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest has achieved tremendous results. We should summarize the experience, study and solve the existing problems, and continue to promote the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest construction to take new steps.

I. Recognize the Urgency of Continuing to Improve the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest, and Shoulder the Historical Mission Assigned to Us

The construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest system covers 13 provinces and 551 counties, with a total area of 4.069 million square kilometers, accounting for 42.4% of the national territory. This shelterbelt forest construction is actually carrying out a "green revolution."

Forests are not only an important resource for national economic development but also the main body of the terrestrial ecosystem, determining the formation of regional climate and hydrological conditions, and geographical landscapes. Forests have multiple ecological functions such as water conservation, soil and water conservation, windbreak and sand fixation, climate regulation, and air purification. Therefore, the main task of this "green revolution" is to form a shelterbelt forest system and a green comprehensive body of coordinated development of agriculture, forestry, and grassland within a few decades, increasing the forest stock from 6.3 billion cubic meters in 1977 to 42.7 billion cubic meters, and providing various forest products to meet the growing needs of the national economy and people's livelihood.

Historical records show that in ancient times, the Three-North region of China had dense forests and fertile grasslands. However, due to the destruction of wars, population explosion, over-felling, farming, grazing, and firewood collection, the land lost its green barrier.

When we summarize our experiences and lessons, we cannot ignore that it is precisely because of human plunder of nature that we have also suffered retribution from nature.

First, land desertification and degradation. China's Three-North region has 12 deserts, sandlands, and Gobi areas from Xinjiang to the western part of Northeast China, covering an area of more than 1.33 million square kilometers, which is larger than the total area of cultivated land in China, forming a wind-sand line of tens of thousands of miles. There are 20–100 days of wind and sand per year, and sandstorms often occur, burying towns, villages, farmlands, and pastures, threatening the safety of railways, highways, and water conservancy facilities, and causing 262 counties (banners, cities, and districts) in this region to have an average of 10.5 million mu of land desertified per year from the early 1950s to the late 1970s, and 237 million mu of land potentially desertified. More seriously, more than 100 million mu of farmland and grassland are severely affected by wind erosion and sand burial, with low and unstable grain yields, and severe degradation of pasture. This is more serious than the loss caused by the occupation and misuse of cultivated land, which makes China's cultivated land decrease by 8 million mu per year. If we do not grasp the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest, the basic conditions for the survival of the Chinese people will have little room for maneuver. In this sense, afforestation is to protect the country, afforestation is to create land, produce grain, and develop animal husbandry.

Second, severe soil erosion. The total area of soil erosion in China's Three-North region is 554,000 square kilometers. Among them, the Loess Plateau is one of the most severe and concentrated areas of soil erosion in the world. According to measurements, the amount of sediment flowing through the Sanmenxia section of the Yellow River increased from 1.2 billion tons in the 1950s to 1.6 billion tons in the 1970s, with more than 80% of the sediment coming from the Loess Plateau. The Loess Plateau loses 1,000–10,000 tons of soil per square kilometer per year, equivalent to scraping off 1 cm of topsoil; the loss of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is about 30 million tons, equivalent to the total output of 100 fertilizer plants producing 300,000 tons of fertilizer per year. The sediment flowing into the Yellow River raises the riverbed by 5–10 cm per year. In some areas of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the riverbed is already more than 10 meters higher than the surrounding land, truly making the Yellow River "flow from the sky" as described in Li Bai's poem. If we do not grasp the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest system, the soil erosion areas will not be able to become prosperous. The Yellow River, the cradle of the Chinese nation, will become a hidden danger to the Chinese nation. In this sense, the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is to conserve water and soil, to resist drought and ensure grain production, and to manage the Yellow River.

Third, frequent droughts and floods. Due to the influence of atmospheric circulation and the lack of forest regulation, droughts and floods in China's Three-North region are frequent and becoming more severe. The annual precipitation in this region is mostly below 400 mm, and more than 60% of it is concentrated in July to September, mostly in the form of heavy rain. Therefore, the climate is characterized by "nine years of drought and one year of flood." Taking Gansu Province as an example, there were 1–2 severe droughts in the 13th century, 12–18 in the 14th century, and 152 severe droughts in the past 300 years since the Qing Dynasty. If we do not grasp the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest system, we will not be able to regulate the climate, and the problem of droughts and floods in this region will not be fundamentally solved. In this sense, afforestation is to create water, to conserve and regulate water sources, and to fundamentally address the work of drought resistance and flood control.

Fourth, the living conditions of the people are threatened. The population growth rate of some provinces (autonomous regions) in the Three-North region from 1953 to 1987 was 40% higher than the national rate during the same period, and it is still expanding at a rate exceeding the national population natural growth rate by 2‰. The fragile Three-North ecological economic system has long exceeded the population's critical line. If we do not control the population while accelerating the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest system, not only will the existing forest vegetation be lost, but the entire Three-North ecological system will collapse in a short time. In this sense, the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is to protect and improve the human living environment.

From the above, it can be seen that the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is indeed an urgent matter. We must overcome the metaphysical view of "planting grass and trees cannot alleviate poverty, and it is better to wait until grain production is increased before planting" that exists in some places and among some comrades, and the short-term behavior of "the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is a long-term project, why rush! It is better to wait until the country is rich and strong before building." We must enhance the sense of urgency, improve self-awareness, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of perseverance and tenacity, and strive to push the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest system to a new stage.

II. Continuously Study New Situations, Solve New Problems, and Ensure the Sustainable and Steady Development of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction

The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to build the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest system is in line with the actual situation of the Three-North region, reflects the strong desire of the people of all ethnic groups in the Three-North region, and has been warmly supported and actively responded to by the leaders at all levels, the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and the local troops in the Three-North region. Over the past 12 years, the policy of "state, collective, and individual afforestation all at once and whoever plants has it" has been implemented; the steps of unified planning, easy before difficult, near before far, focusing on key points, and phased implementation have been taken; the fundraising measures of "publicly funded, privately built, multi-party funding, and joint construction" have been adopted; the engineering afforestation management methods of "designing according to the plan, constructing according to the design, investing according to the project, and accepting according to the standard" have been implemented, as well as the establishment of term target responsibility system for local governments at all levels and the improvement of engineering construction command organizations and other administrative measures, achieving great results. According to the investigation and verification, from 1978 to the end of 1988, the central and local financial departments and other channels have invested a total of 2.433 billion yuan, the masses have contributed 1.1 billion man-days of labor, completed 138 million mu of artificial afforestation, 34.2 million mu of closed mountain afforestation, 3.6 million mu of aerial seeding afforestation, and more than 3 billion trees planted around houses, villages, water, and roads. The scale and speed of the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest are quite satisfactory, and it has been praised internationally as the "Great Green Wall of China" and the "world's largest ecological engineering project."

However, the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is indeed a long-term project in a region with a dry climate, sandstorm hazards, soil erosion, and underdeveloped economy, with very arduous tasks and many difficulties. The current prominent problem is that since the second phase of the project started in 1986, the scope has expanded, the tasks have increased, and the difficulties have increased. At present, China has not yet established a timber pricing system, and ecological benefits are often ignored and do not receive due compensation. In this case, it is difficult to completely solve the problem of interest distribution throughout the process of shelterbelt forest construction with just the policy of "whoever plants has it." It is difficult to rely on self-accumulation to achieve reproduction; at the same time, many valuable forestry technologies are only applied in specific areas and cannot be scaled up or transformed into productive forces. Therefore, problems such as a significant decline in seedling production and afforestation, severe forest pests and rodent damage, difficulty in managing young and middle-aged forests, lack of necessary fire prevention facilities, outdated forestry machinery and equipment, and difficulty in developing and utilizing forestry resources have emerged. We must take the responsibility to the Party and the people's cause to heart and solve these problems seriously.

(1) Adapt to the great system project of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest construction, and have a set of policies and supporting measures. The construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is an industry with ecological benefits as the main focus and also economic benefits. It is more prominent and important to rely on policies. In the case that the national and local finances cannot fully fund it, the key is to recognize that ecological benefits are the crystallization of socially necessary labor, which not only has use value but also has value, fundamentally solving the problem that ecological benefits are all occupied by society without compensation, and economic benefits do not receive due compensation. In the future, all aspects that reflect social benefits and ecological benefits should gradually implement corresponding compensation measures.

(2) Implement multi-level funding input. The construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest has the characteristics of strong social benefits and long growth cycles. The state, local, collective, individual, and relevant industries should all increase their input to the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest and insist on raising funds through multiple channels. The national finance should increase a little, and the finance of the provincial, municipal, and county levels should also increase a little. Town and township enterprises should contribute a little from their profits to the construction of the shelterbelt forest. Other special funds should also have a share in the construction of the shelterbelt forest and should not be withdrawn. A sound labor accumulation fund system should be established. In addition, some forestry interest-free loans should be arranged, mainly for the construction of fast-growing and high-yielding forests, economic forests, and forestry diversified operations, which have quick results and high economic benefits, as the starting capital to enhance the self-accumulation and self-development ability of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest project.

(3) Rely on science and technology to promote forestry. Science and technology are productive forces. The construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest project should firmly establish the guiding ideology of relying on scientific and technological progress, incorporate the development and application of applicable technologies into the project construction plan, closely combine them with engineering afforestation, and vigorously promote the large-scale application of applicable technologies, such as: the cultivation technology of seedlings with strong adaptability; deep planting technology for dry farming forestry; sand barrier sand fixation and afforestation technology; closed mountain and sand afforestation, aerial seeding afforestation, and forest pest and rodent prevention and control technology, etc., transforming applicable technologies into productive forces, and significantly improving the quality and benefits of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest construction. Supporting measures should be implemented to ensure application and promotion, and they should be included in the target responsibility system of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest construction, with regular inspections.

III. Put Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry on an Equal Footing, and Strengthen the Leadership of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Construction, Emphasizing Practical Work

(1) The construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest is a "green revolution" and a great cause that benefits the present and future generations. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council attach great importance to and care about it. Local governments at all levels should continue to strive, list this project in the important agenda, and work hard in practice, with one government handing over to the next, and one generation following another. We must overcome short-term behavior, implement a "relay race," and not have "one general, one order," with tight and loose times, and stop and go.

(2) Leaders at all levels and all industries should establish forestry projects. Through the establishment of projects, they can familiarize themselves with the construction of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest project, enrich and improve their leadership level; set up models, gain experience, and promote and drive the surface construction of the shelterbelt forest.

(3) Deepen propaganda and create public opinion to boost the morale of all industries and the broad masses of cadres and the masses. The planning scheme and construction tasks should be implemented in all industries, units, and mountain plots, and a sound target responsibility system and management methods should be established to rely on the strength of the whole society to carry out project construction. On the basis of consolidating and improving the existing construction achievements, take effective measures to complete the construction tasks of the second phase of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest project.

(4) Greatly publicize and commend advanced examples. For provinces, cities, counties, townships, and villages that have done well in afforestation, as well as individuals, they should be widely publicized and commended. For example, Yuyao County in Shanxi Province has a tree coverage rate of 46%; Yulin Region in Shaanxi Province, Zhongwei County in Ningxia Autonomous Region, and Linze Region in Gansu Province are all typical examples of oases advancing into deserts. Wang Yushan, the former Party branch secretary of Xinjie Sand Control Station in Yijinhuoluo Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has led the entire station's staff to plant trees and fix sand since 1970, making the forest area of the sand control station expand from more than 20,000 mu to 180,000 mu, and controlling the area of flowing sand to more than 200,000 mu. He devoted his life to planting trees and sand control. Wang Yushan is just one of the thousands of grassroots forestry cadres. Our country has many grassroots forestry cadres and forestry technicians who work tirelessly, bravely facing sandstorms and severe cold, and actively working in barren mountains and sand dunes. They are not famous, do not gain benefits, and make silent contributions to the people there. We should thank them, and the whole society should pay tribute to them.

(5) Go deep into the front line of project construction, strengthen investigation and research, continuously study new situations, solve new problems, and ensure that relying on policies, relying on science and technology, and relying on input are put into practice. We must be willing to invest in manpower, material resources, and funds, and strengthen planning and financial management to manage and use the special funds for the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest well, cherish manpower, and improve the economic benefits of the input.

(6) Establish an inspection, evaluation, and reward system. The good or bad performance of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest and the increase or decrease of forest vegetation coverage should be used as an important part of the performance appraisal of local governments at all levels. For county (banner, city, district) governments that have fully or over-fulfilled the annual construction tasks, the Ministry of Forestry should give them a commendation and report, and support them to start one or two new construction projects; for counties (banners, cities, districts) that have not completed the annual construction tasks, have not protected the forest, or have had forest fires or human and animal damage incidents, they should be given a warning and report, and the special investment for the Three-North region should be appropriately reduced; for those that have caused serious losses, the leadership responsibility should be investigated, and serious treatment should be given.

    继续努力坚持完成三北防护林建设伟大工程
    陈俊生
    1978年，党中央、国务院决定在我国三北（西北、华北北部、东北西部）地区建设防护林体系，并把这项工程列为国家经济建设的重点项目之一。三北防护林建设，既是改变我国半壁河山生态环境，为我国建立森林后备资源的根本大计，也是保护国土，提高土地生产力，保障和促进农、牧业稳定增产的重大措施。它是直接关系到三北地区33个民族、1.3亿人民治穷致富的一件大事。十余年来，三北防护林建设取得了巨大成绩。我们应该总结经验，研究解决存在问题，继续推动三北防护林建设迈出新步伐。
    一、认识继续搞好三北防护林建设的紧迫性，自觉地肩负起历史赋予我们的使命
    三北防护林体系工程建设，包括13个省的551个县，总面积406.9万平方公里，占国土面积42.4％的范围，这个防护林建设实际上是在进行一场“绿色革命”。
    森林不仅是国民经济发展的重要资源，也是陆地生态系统的主体，是形成区域性气候和水文条件、地理景观的决定因素。森林具有涵养水源、保持水土、防风固沙、调节气候、净化空气等多种生态功能。所以，这场“绿色革命”的主要任务是，要用几十年的时间形成林带、林网、片林有机结合的防护林体系和农业、林业、草业协调发展的绿色综合体，使森林蓄积量由1977年的6.3亿立方米增加到42.7亿立方米，并能提供其他多种林产品，满足国计民生对林业日益增长的需要。
    据历史文献记载，很早以前，我国三北地区有茂密的森林，肥美的草原。但是，由于历代战争的破坏，人口的剧增，过度的砍伐、农垦、放牧、樵柴，大地失去了绿色屏障。
    在我们总结经验教训的时候，不能不看到，正是由于人们对自然界的掠夺，因而也受到了自然界的报复。
    一是土地沙化、退化。我国三北地区从新疆到东北西部有12片沙漠、沙地和戈壁，面积133万多平方公里，大于我国耕地面积的总和，形成长达万里的风沙线，年风沙日20—100天，经常出现沙暴，流沙埋没城镇、村庄、农田、牧场，威胁铁路、公路、水利设施的安全，导致这一区域内262个县（旗、市、区）在本世纪50年代初期到70年代末期平均每年有1050万亩土地沙化，还有2.37亿亩土地潜在沙漠化。更严重的是，有1亿多亩农田、草原受到强度风蚀和沙埋，粮食产量低而不稳，牧草严重蜕化，这要比占用、滥用耕地使我国耕地每年以800万亩的速度锐减造成的损失更为严重。若不抓紧三北防护林建设，我国人民生存的基本条件就没有多大回旋余地了。从这个意义上讲，造林就是保护国土，造林就是造地，生产粮食，发展牧业。
    二是水土流失严重。我国三北地区水土流失总面积达55.4万平方公里。其中黄土高原是目前世界上水土流失最严重、最集中的区域之一。据测定，每年流经黄河三门峡的泥沙由50年代的12亿吨增加到70年代的16亿吨，其中80％以上的泥沙来自黄土高原。黄土高原每年每平方公里流失土壤1000—10000吨，相当于刮去1厘米厚的表土；随之流失的氮、磷、钾约3000万吨，相当于100座年产30万吨化肥厂产量的总和。注入黄河的泥沙每年使黄河的河床增高5—10厘米，在黄河下游的一些地区，河床已经高出两岸地面10多米，真的变成李白诗中所说的“黄河之水天上来”了。若不抓紧三北防护林体系建设，水土流失区就不能治穷致富。黄河，这个中华民族的摇篮，将成为中华民族的隐患。从这个意义上讲，建设三北防护林就是保水改土、抗旱保粮，就是治理黄河的大业。
    三是旱涝灾害频繁。我国三北地区由于大气环流的作用和缺少森林的调节，旱涝灾害频繁，而且越来越严重。这里的年降水量大部分为400毫米以下，而且60％以上的都集中在7—9月份，多以暴雨形式出现。因此，形成了“十年九旱，不旱则涝”的气候特点。以甘肃省为例，13世纪出现大旱1—2次，14世纪12—18次，清代以来300年干旱成灾的就有152次。若不抓紧三北防护林体系建设，就不能调节气候，这一带旱涝灾害问题就根本得不到解决。从这个意义上讲，造林就是造水，就是涵养和调节水源，就是从根本上抓抗旱排涝的工作。
    四是人们生存条件受到威胁。三北地区的某些省（区）1953年至1987年期间人口增长率比全国同期高40％，现在还以超过全国人口自然增长率2‰的速度膨胀。脆弱的三北生态经济系统的负载，早已超过了人口的临界线。若不在控制人口的同时加速三北防护林体系建设，不但现有的一点森林植被保不住，整个三北生态系统用不了多长时间将会彻底崩溃。从这个意义上讲，建设三北防护林就是保护和改善人类的生存环境。
    从上所述可以看出，三北防护林建设的确是刻不容缓的大事。我们一定要克服当前在一些地方和同志中存在的“种草种树不能治穷致富，等把粮食搞上去再种也不迟”的形而上学观点和“三北防护林建设是百年大计，何必着急！等民富国强了再建也不迟”的短期行为，增强紧迫感，提高自觉性，发扬坚韧不拔、坚持不懈的革命精神，努力把三北防护林体系建设推向新阶段。
    二，不断研究新情况，解决新问题，确保三北防护林建设持续进行，稳步发展
    党中央、国务院建设三北防护林体系的决定符合三北地区的实际情况，反映了三北地区各族人民的强烈愿望，得到三北地区各级领导、广大干部群众和当地驻军的热烈拥护，积极响应。12年来，采取国家、集体、个人造林一齐上和谁造谁有的方针政策；统一规划、先易后难、由近及远、突出重点，分期分批实施的步骤；民办国助、群众投劳、多方集资、协同共建的筹资措施；按规划设计、按设计施工、按项目投资、按标准验收的工程造林管理办法，以及建立各级地方政府任期目标责任制，健全工程建设指挥机构等行政措施，取得了很大成绩。据清查核实，从1978年至1988年底，中央和地方财政及其他渠道共计投资24.33亿元，群众投入劳动11亿个工日，完成人工造林1.38亿亩，封山育林3420万亩，飞机播种造林360万亩，四旁（宅旁、村旁、水旁、路旁）植树30多亿株。三北防护林建设规模和速度都是十分可喜的，在国际上被誉为“中国的绿色长城”、“生态工程的世界之最”。
    但是，三北防护林毕竟是在气候干旱、风沙危害、水土流失、经济不发达地区进行的一项长期性的建设，任务非常艰巨，困难的确很多。当前，突出的问题是，这项建设自1986年进入二期工程以来，由于范围扩大了，任务增大了，难度增大了。目前，我国尚未建立林价制度，生态效益往往被忽视，而且得不到应有补偿，在这种情况下，仅“谁造谁有”这一条政策很难完全解决防护林建设全过程的利益分配问题，很难依靠自我积累实现再生产；同时，许多宝贵的营林适用技术，只停留在点上，成不了规模，变不成社会生产力。因此，现在已经出现了育苗造林大滑坡、林木病虫鼠害严重、中幼林难以抚育管理、缺少必要的护林防火设施、林业机械设备陈旧和林业资源难以开发利用等问题。我们要以对党对人民事业高度负责的精神，认真加以解决。
    （一）适应三北防护林建设这一伟大系统工程，要有一整套政策和配套措施。三北防护林建设是以生态效益为主、也有经济效益的产业，依靠政策显得更加突出，更加重要。在国家和地方财政不可能对其进行全额投资的情况下，关键是要承认生态效益是社会必要劳动的凝结，不但有使用价值，而且有价值，从根本上解决生态效益均被社会无偿占用，经济效益得不到应有补偿的问题。今后，凡体现社会效益和生态效益的，应逐步实行相应的补偿措施。
    （二）实行多层次资金投入。三北防护林建设具有社会效益性强、生长周期长的特点。国家、地方、集体、个人和有关的各行各业都要增加对三北防护林建设的投入，坚持多渠道筹措资金。国家财政增加一点，省、地、县三级财政也要增加一点。乡镇企业要从利润中拿出一点用于防护林建设。其他专项资金也应该有防护林建设的份额，不能抽走。要建立健全劳动积累工制度。此外，还应该安排一些林业贴息贷款，主要用于营造速生丰产林、经济林和林业多种经营等见效快、经济效益高的项目，以此作为起动资金，增强三北防护林工程建设自我积累、自我发展的能力。
    （三）依靠科技兴林。科学技术是生产力，三北防护林工程建设要牢固树立依靠科学技术进步的指导思想，把适用技术的开发应用纳入工程建设计划，与工程造林紧密配合起来，狠抓适用技术的大面积推广，比如：抗逆性强的苗木培育技术；钻孔深栽、开沟深栽旱作林业丰产技术；设置沙障固沙造林技术；封山封沙育林、飞播造林、林木病虫鼠害防治技术，等等，变适用技术为社会生产力，大幅度地提高三北防护林建设的质量和效益。应搞好配套措施，确保应用和推广，并纳入三北防护林建设的目标责任制，定期检查。
    三、把农、林、牧放在同等地位，切实加强对三北防护林建设的领导，讲求真抓实干
    （一）三北防护林建设是一场“绿色革命”，是造福当代、荫及子孙的伟大事业，党中央、国务院对此非常重视和关心。各级地方政府应再接再厉，把这项工程建设列入重要议事日程，真抓实干，一届政府做给一届政府看，一代接着一代干。要克服短期行为，实行“接力赛”，不要“一个将军一道令”，时紧时松，干干停停。
    （二）各级领导、各行各业都要兴办林业点。通过办点，熟悉三北防护林工程建设，丰富和提高领导水平；树立样板，取得经验，带动和促进面上的防护林建设。
    （三）深化宣传，大造舆论，把各行各业和广大干部群众的劲头鼓起来。要把规划方案和建设任务落实到各行各业、各个单位和山头地块，并且建立健全目标责任制和管理办法，依靠全社会的力量开展工程建设。在巩固提高现有建设成果的基础上，采取有力措施，全面完成三北防护林二期工程建设任务。
    （四）应大力宣传、表彰先进典型。对于造林搞得好的省、地、县、乡、村以及个人，应当大力宣传、表彰。比如：山西省右玉县，植树造林覆盖率达46％；陕西省的榆林地区、宁夏自治区的中卫县、甘肃省的临泽地区等都是绿洲向沙漠推进的典型。内蒙古自治区伊金霍洛旗新街治沙站原党支部书记王玉珊同志，自1970年以来，20年如一日，带领全站职工植树固沙，使治沙站有林面积由2万余亩发展到18万亩，控制流沙面积20多万亩，他为植树治沙献出了生命。王玉珊同志只不过是千千万万个林业基层干部中的一个代表。我们国家有多少林业基层干部和林业科技人员，他们终年累月，顶风沙，冒严寒，活跃在荒山和沙丘之中，他们不出名，不获利，在那里默默无闻地为人民做奉献。我们要感谢他们，全社会都要向他们致敬。
    （五）深入工程建设第一线，加强调查研究，不断研究新情况，解决新问题，把依靠政策、依靠科学技术、依靠投入落在实处。要舍得人、财、物投入，并且加强计划财务管理，管好用好三北防护林专项资金，珍惜民力，提高投入的经济效益。
    （六）建立检查评比奖励制度。把三北防护林搞得好坏和森林植被覆盖率的增减，作为对地方各级政府政绩考核的重要内容之一。对于全面完成和超额完成当年建设任务的县（旗、市、区）政府，林业部要给予通报嘉奖，并且再扶持新上一、二个建设项目；对没有完成当年建设任务、造林不护林、发生林火或人畜破坏事件的县（旗、市、区），要给予通报警告，并酌情削减三北专项投资；造成重大损失的，要追究领导责任，严肃处理。
