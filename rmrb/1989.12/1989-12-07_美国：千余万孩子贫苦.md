According to the U.S. _Washington Post_, although the United States is known for its affluence, the U.S. Census Bureau recently released some disturbing statistics about American children.

Despite the U.S. economy experiencing six consecutive years of growth, 12.6 million Americans under the age of 18 live in households with incomes below the government's poverty line.

George Miller, chairman of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families and a Democratic congressman from California, recently stated that his committee has found that "millions of children are unhealthy, uneducated, and unable to participate in the future high-tech economy."

Children becoming the poorest group in American society is a recent phenomenon, occurring over the past decade. About 15 years ago, the elderly were generally considered the poorest.

Economist D. Lee Bawden of the American Urban Institute attributes the rise in child poverty partly to the increase in single-parent households.

In 1960, 91% of white children and 67% of black children lived with both parents. By 1988, these percentages had dropped to 79% and 39%, respectively, meaning that over 17 million children live with a single parent or with relatives and non-relatives. Single-parent households make it more likely that families or children will be impoverished. In most cases, there is no father in the home to help support the family, and the mother may find it difficult to secure and maintain a job unless she can find reliable (and often expensive) childcare. This is why, in 1987, out of the 12.4 million children living in poverty, approximately 7 million were in single-parent households.

    美国：千余万孩子贫苦
    新华社北京12月4日电　据美国《华盛顿邮报》报道，虽然美国号称富足，但美国国情普查局最近公布了一些令人不安的有关美国儿童的数字。
    尽管美国经济连续6年有所增长，但有1260万不到18岁的美国人生活在收入是政府规定的贫困线以下的家庭中。
    美国众议院特别委员会儿童、青年和家庭委员会主席、加利福尼亚州民主党众议员乔治·米勒最近说，他的委员会发现有“数以百万计的儿童身体不健康，未受过教育，无法参加将来的高度技术化经济活动”。
    儿童成为美国社会中最穷的人群还是最近十年来的事情，大约15年前，普遍的现象还是老年人最贫穷。
    美国城市研究所经济学家D·李·鲍登把儿童贫困现象的出现部分地与单亲家庭的出现联系在一起。
    在1960年，同父母住在一起的白人儿童和黑人儿童还分别占同一肤色儿童的91％和67％。到1988年，这两个百分比就分别降到了79％和39％，这就是说，有1700多万儿童同单亲或者同亲戚和非亲戚住在一起。单亲家庭使家庭或儿童更有可能穷困潦倒。大多数情况是，家中没有父亲工作帮助维持家庭生活，母亲除非能找到可靠的人（往往很费钱）照看孩子，否则她可能会发现很难找到和保持一份工作。这就是为什么1987年在生活贫困的1240万儿童中，约有700万是生活在单亲家庭中。
