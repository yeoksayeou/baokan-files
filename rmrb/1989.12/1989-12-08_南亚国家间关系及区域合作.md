From November 21 to 23, the "Conference on Relations Among South Asian Countries and Between China and South Asian Countries" was held in Chengdu, Sichuan, organized by the Chinese South Asia Society. Representatives and scholars attending the conference expressed various views on the topic.

Several representatives pointed out in their speeches that the South Asian region is a key transportation hub between Europe and Asia, home to one-fifth of the world's population, and also one of the poorest regions in the world. The countries in this region all face the urgent task of developing their economies and improving the living standards of their people. With the changes in the international situation and the need for development in the region, the South Asian countries established the "South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation" (SAARC) in December 1985. Over the past four years, SAARC has held four summits and seven foreign ministers' meetings. SAARC has made positive achievements in politically resolving bilateral disputes and conflicts, coordinating economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation, and developing social welfare. However, due to long-standing issues left over from colonial rule, as well as differences in geopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural aspects among South Asian countries, and the influence of external forces, some bilateral disputes and conflicts remain unresolved, and some have even flared up in recent years. Examples include the Kashmir territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, the Ganges water distribution issue between India and Bangladesh, the border trade conflict between Nepal and India, and the dispute over the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka. Some people believe that the improvement of relations among South Asian countries will be "slow and gradual" or may proceed with a mix of "warmth and coldness." Therefore, only through mutual understanding and respect, without dwelling on historical grievances, differences in beliefs, or the strength of nations, and especially by adhering to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, can relations between countries develop in a normal and healthy manner.

Regarding China's relations with South Asian countries, especially with India, the attendees conducted a serious discussion. They believe that China and several major South Asian countries are neighboring countries connected by mountains and rivers. China's relations with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are exemplary of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. After experiencing the friendship of the 1950s and the setbacks of the 1960s, China's relations with India were normalized in the 1970s. Although the border issue has not been resolved, it does not affect bilateral cooperation in economics, trade, and science and technology based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Therefore, the prospects for China's development of relations with South Asian countries are very broad.

Some speakers believe that China and South Asian countries are all Third World countries, and there are many similar issues in developing national economies and adjusting industrial structures, providing many opportunities for mutual learning and borrowing. Currently, the level of economic and trade relations between China and South Asian countries is still very low. For example, in the 1987-1988 fiscal year, the total trade volume between China and India was only 0.53% of India's total foreign trade and 0.18% of China's total foreign trade. Trade volumes with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are also not large. This indicates that there is still great potential for China to develop economic and trade relations with South Asian countries. Further emphasizing and developing friendly cooperative relations with South Asian countries will not only benefit China's modernization drive but also contribute to peace and stability in Asia and the world.

    南亚国家间关系及区域合作
    11月21日至23日，由中国南亚学会主办的“南亚国家间及我国与南亚各国间关系讨论会”在四川成都召开。与会代表和学者纷纷就此问题提出了各种看法。
    不少代表在发言中指出，南亚地区处于欧亚交通要冲，拥有全球1／5的人口，同时也是世界上最贫困的地区之一。该地区国家都面临着发展经济，提高人民生活水平的迫切任务。随着国际形势的变化和本地区各国谋求发展的需要，南亚各国于1985年12月成立了“南亚区域合作联盟”。“联盟”成立4年来，共举行了4次成员国首脑会议，7次外长会议。“联盟”在政治解决双边争端及矛盾方面，在协调经济、科技、文化合作和发展社会福利等方面，都取得了积极成果。另外，由于长期的殖民统治遗留下来的问题，加上南亚各国在地缘政治、经济实力、宗教及文化上的差异，以及受外部势力的影响，一些双边争端及矛盾至今尚未解决，有的近年来还时有爆发，如印巴克什米尔领土争端，印孟恒河水分配问题，尼印边境贸易冲突，印斯撤军之争等等。有人据此认为，南亚各国关系的改善速度将是“缓慢的、渐进的”，或可能是“冷暖交织进行”。所以，只有相互谅解和尊重，不计较历史恩怨、信仰差别和国家强弱，特别是都要遵守不干涉别国内政的准则，国家之间的关系才能正常健康地发展。
    对中国同南亚国家间，特别是同印度之间的关系，与会者进行了认真的讨论。他们认为，中国同南亚几个主要国家是山水相连的邻邦。中国同巴基斯坦、孟加拉国、尼泊尔、斯里兰卡的关系是不同社会制度国家和平共处的典范，同印度的关系经历过50年代的友好和60年代的波折后，70年代恢复正常，目前虽然边界问题还未解决，但不影响双方在共同倡导的和平共处五项原则基础上，发展经济贸易和科技文化合作。因而中国同南亚各国发展关系的前景十分广阔。
    一些发言者认为，中国同南亚各国同属第三世界国家，在发展国民经济及调整产业结构方面，有许多类似的问题，可以互相学习和借鉴的地方不少。目前中国同南亚各国的经济贸易水平还很低，譬如，在1987—1988年度，中印贸易总额仅占印度外贸总额的0.53％，占中国外贸总额的0.18％。中国同巴基斯坦、孟加拉国、尼泊尔、斯里兰卡的贸易额也不大。这说明我国发展同南亚各国的经济贸易还有很大的潜力。进一步重视和发展中国同南亚各国的友好合作关系，不仅有利于我国四个现代化的建设，也有利于亚洲和世界的和平与稳定。
