Guangdong province has made combating smuggling a key task in its rectification efforts. Since late April this year, the province has launched a large-scale, high-profile campaign against smuggling along its coastal regions, successfully curbing the once-rampant smuggling activities.

In recent months, various levels of party committees and governments along the Guangdong coast have strengthened their leadership in the anti-smuggling campaign. Departments such as customs, border defense, industry and commerce, public security, and judicial authorities have worked closely together. They have adopted a comprehensive approach of education, crackdown, punishment, rectification, and management to tackle the issue from multiple angles. Various cities and counties have organized a total of 75,000 personnel for coordinated actions, waging a comprehensive battle on sea, shore, land, and markets. This campaign has achieved five significant results:

First, awareness among officials and the public in key smuggling-prone coastal areas has been significantly raised.

Second, smuggling criminals and syndicates have been severely punished.

Third, 31 smuggling hubs and 133 smuggling hideouts have been dismantled.

Fourth, smuggling activities within government agencies, organizations, and enterprises have been largely stopped.

Fifth, comprehensive anti-smuggling measures have been strengthened, and some loopholes have been plugged through institutional improvements.
