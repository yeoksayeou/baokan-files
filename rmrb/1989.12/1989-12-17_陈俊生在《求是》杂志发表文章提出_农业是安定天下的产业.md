New China News Agency, Beijing, December 16th — Vice Premier Chen Junsheng published an article titled "Seriously Implementing the Policy of Taking Agriculture as the Foundation" in the 24th issue of "Seeking Truth" magazine published today. The article points out that agriculture is the industry that stabilizes the nation. The central government, local governments, collectives, and farmers should all increase their investment in agriculture. By increasing investment in agriculture, the ratio between industry and agriculture can gradually return to normal.

The article states that if agriculture is stable, the nation will be stable. With 1.1 billion people, if the problem of food cannot be solved, no matter how well other problems are solved, stability cannot be achieved. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China has carried out a series of major reforms, and the achievements of rural reforms are the most remarkable and widely recognized.

The article points out that at the same time, we should also be soberly aware that the current situation of agriculture in our country is not optimistic. The following two sets of figures can illustrate the seriousness of the problem: from 1957 to 1988, over 30 years, an average of 8 million mu of cultivated land was lost each year, reducing the per capita cultivated land from 2.59 mu to 1.33 mu, nearly halving; the per capita grain production decreased from 393.7 kilograms in 1984 to 362 kilograms in 1988. The number of provinces that net export grain decreased from 21 in 1953 to 5 in 1988, with the total net import quantity reaching more than 15 billion kilograms.

The article says that for the time being, agriculture is still manageable, but in the long run, there is a potential crisis. Because population growth is difficult to control, the reduction of cultivated land is also difficult to control, and grain production is subject to many constraints. This is the key to the development of agriculture in our country.

The article says that the investment of the central government, local governments, collectives, and farmers should all be increased. The central government should gradually increase its investment first. The state's investment in agriculture cannot be much, but it has an important guiding role for collectives and farmers. By increasing investment in agriculture, the ratio between industry and agriculture can gradually return to normal. This is also an important goal for the next three years of rectification and readjustment.

The article proposes that agriculture is not just the responsibility of the agricultural sector, but a common task for all sectors. Each department should make corresponding adjustments to its economic business plan structure.

The article says that China's agriculture has great potential for development. In recent years, agricultural development should first focus on transforming medium and low-yield fields. Fully tapping the potential of agriculture itself and developing towards resource-saving and high-yielding types.

    陈俊生在《求是》杂志发表文章提出
    农业是安定天下的产业
    新华社北京12月16日电　国务委员陈俊生在今日出版的《求是》杂志第24期发表《认真贯彻以农业为基础的方针》的文章。文章指出，农业是安定天下的产业，中央、地方、集体和农民对农业的投入都应该增加，通过增加对农业的投入，逐步使工农比例关系趋向正常。
    文章说，农业稳，天下定。11亿人口，解决不了吃饭问题，其他方面问题解决得再好，也肯定无法安定。党的十一届三中全会后，我国进行了一系列重大改革，而农村改革成绩最显著，举世公认。
    文章指出，同时，也应该清醒地看到，当前我国农业的情况不容乐观。以下两组数字可以说明问题的严重性：1957年到1988年30年间，平均每年减少耕地800万亩，人均占有耕地从2.59亩减少到1.33亩，减少近一半；人均占有粮食产量从1984年的393.7公斤，减少到1988年的362公斤，粮食净调出省从1953年的21个，减少到1988年的5个，净调入省的总调入量达150多亿公斤。
    文章说，从目前来说，农业的日子还过得去，但从长远发展看，存在着潜在的危机。因为人口增长很难控制，耕地面积减少也是难以控制住的，而粮食增产则受到诸多因素制约。这就是我国农业发展中的要害。
    文章说，中央、地方、集体和农民的投入都应该增加。中央首先要逐步增加。国家对农业投入的资金不可能很多，但对集体和农民具有重要的导向作用。通过增加对农业的投入，逐步使工农比例关系趋向正常。这也是今后三年治理整顿的一个重要目标。
    文章提出，农业不仅仅是农业部门的事情，而是各行各业共同的任务。各个部门都应该对本部门的经济业务计划结构进行相应的调整。
    文章说，我国农业开发潜力很大。近几年农业开发首先要把改造中低产田当作一个重点。充分挖掘农业自身的潜力，向资源节约高产型方向发展。
