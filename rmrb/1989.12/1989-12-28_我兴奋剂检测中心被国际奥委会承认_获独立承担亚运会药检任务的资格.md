Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 27th. (Reporter Xǔ Jīrén) The Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center recently received a letter from Prince Médecin, the chairman of the International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission, announcing that the center has officially been recognized by the International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission.

The Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center underwent three qualification tests and two level tests this year before obtaining this approval, becoming the third laboratory in Asia, after Tokyo and Seoul, to be recognized by the International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission.

This means that the Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center has also gained the qualification to independently undertake the drug testing tasks for next year's Asian Games. During the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, because its drug testing center was not officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission, it had to spend a large sum of money to hire experts from the Medical Commission to oversee its laboratory work. The Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center was established in 1986, with two sponsoring units being the Institute of Sports Medicine under the State Sports Commission and the Institute of Materia Medica under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

    我兴奋剂检测中心被国际奥委会承认
    获独立承担亚运会药检任务的资格
    新华社北京12月27日电　（记者许基仁）北京兴奋剂检测中心日前接到国际奥委会医学委员会主席梅罗德亲王的来信，宣布中心已正式取得国际奥委会医学委员会的承认。
    北京兴奋剂检测中心今年经过了3次合格考试和2次水平考试，才得到了这份批准信，成为亚洲继东京和汉城两家实验室之后第三个获国际奥委会医学委员会承认的实验室。
    这意味着北京兴奋剂检测中心也同时获得了独立承担明年亚运会药检任务的资格。1986年汉城举办第十届亚运会时，因其药检中心未获国际奥委会医学委员会的正式承认而不得不花费一笔巨款聘请医学委员会的专家们主持其实验室的工作。北京兴奋剂检测中心成立于1986年，两家筹办单位是国家体委运动医学研究所和中国医科院药物研究所。
