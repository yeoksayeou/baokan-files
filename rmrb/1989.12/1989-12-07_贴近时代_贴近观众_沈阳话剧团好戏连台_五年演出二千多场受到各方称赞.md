Since 1985, the Shenyang Drama Troupe has created 6 major plays, performed 2,200 times across the country, attracting 3 million viewers, and generating 2.37 million yuan in revenue. The troupe has produced 4 actors and directors who have won the highest awards in national drama or film. The troupe's achievements in producing outstanding performances and generating significant revenue have garnered attention from the national cultural community.

How has a medium-sized local troupe achieved such remarkable success? Chen Yuhang, the 46-year-old troupe leader, attributes it to three key factors: staying close to the times, staying close to the audience, and pursuing excellence relentlessly.

In recent years, the Shenyang Drama Troupe has focused on staging plays that reflect contemporary life. For example, "Walking Out of the Valley of Death" portrays the noble spirit of soldiers on the front lines during the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam. "The Noisy Summer" depicts the joys and sorrows of a group of young individual entrepreneurs. Their latest production, "Whirlpool in the Tide," is based on the largest bribery case in Shenyang and focuses on the theme of anti-corruption. Their plays, which closely reflect life and resonate with audiences, have been successful due to their bold artistic innovations. They not only pay attention to staging world-class dramas and updating the theatrical concepts of their cast and crew, but also strive to break away from traditional theatrical norms, creating entirely new and highly entertaining performances. Over the years, their groundbreaking productions, such as the American classic "The Love Under the Elm Tree," the Soviet classic "The Bench," and the popular musical comedy "Wrong Train," have captivated audiences and brought a new generation of young actors to the forefront.

    贴近时代　贴近观众
    沈阳话剧团好戏连台
    五年演出二千多场受到各方称赞
    新华社沈阳12月6日电　（记者魏运亨）沈阳话剧团自1985年以来，这个剧团共创作了6台大戏，在全国演出2200场，观众达300万人次，演出收入237万元。全团有4名演员、导演获全国戏剧或影视最高奖。这个团出人出戏出效益的经验，为全国文化界所瞩目。
    一个中等规模的地方剧团，何以能创造出如此奇迹？46岁的团长陈欲航认为主要靠三条：紧贴时代，紧贴观众，执著追求。
    沈阳话剧团这几年排的新剧，大多是反映当代生活的。比如《走出死谷》反映了对越自卫反击战前线官兵的高尚情操；《喧闹的夏天》描写了一批青年个体户的喜怒哀乐；最近排演的《大潮中的漩涡》则是以沈阳最大的一起行贿受贿案为原型编写的以反腐败为内容的话剧。他们创作演出的话剧紧贴生活，扣人心弦，观众愿看，成功的另一个重要因素是艺术上的大胆创新。他们既注意排演世界名剧佳作，在实践中更新演职人员的戏剧观念，提高观众的欣赏水平，更注意大幅度跨越传统话剧的演出规范，创造出全新的、观赏性极强的新剧目。几年来，他们在国内首次演出的美国名剧《榆树下的恋情》、苏联名剧《长椅》以及风靡各地的歌舞故事剧《搭错车》，赢得了观众，一大批年轻演员迅速脱颖而出。
