Zhao Fuxiang is a farmer from Sanquanyu Village, Caishi Township, Jinan City. He is now over fifty years old. Fifteen years ago, his wife passed away, leaving behind four sons named "Bao, Gui, Ming, and Liang," as well as his elderly mother. Over the years, under his care, the children have all grown into adults.

In 1981, during the recruitment season, Zhao Fuxiang's eldest son, Zhao Chengbao, who was 18 years old, did not return after going out to drive a tractor. Zhao Fuxiang then enlisted him. Some well-meaning people said, "Old Zhao, your son Chengbao is the first person in the village to have a tractor driver's license and earns the most money. Why are you sending your money tree away?" Zhao Fuxiang replied, "If the country is not peaceful, what use is a money tree!" The eldest son passed the physical examination and political review and received his enlistment notice. He told his father, "Father, after I leave, Grandma and my younger brothers will all depend on you."

Zhao Fuxiang looked at his son affectionately and said, "You can go with a peaceful mind. In the army, work hard and bring honor to the hometown. As for the family, even if the sky falls, I will hold it up. When your younger brothers grow up, I will send them to the army too. You are the first to enlist, so set a good example!"

After the eldest son left, Zhao Fuxiang painfully sold the tractor his son had driven to support the education of his three younger sons.

In 1982, during the frequent border conflicts between China and Vietnam, Zhao Fuxiang's second son, Zhao Chenggui, graduated from high school. Zhao Fuxiang enlisted him again. The Zhao family's gate had an additional honor plaque.

Some people heard Zhao Fuxiang often talk about the great principles of "defending the republic" and asked him, "Can you really let your third son enlist again?" In 1986, Zhao Fuxiang sent his third son, Zhao Chengming, who had learned masonry after graduating from junior high school, to the army.

This year, in early spring, Zhao Fuxiang's mother passed away. His fourth son, Chengliang, who was 18 years old, said he wanted to follow his three elder brothers and go to the army to defend the motherland. The Caishi Township People's Government and the Military Affairs Department, considering Zhao's actual difficulties, did not want to let his fourth son enlist. After hearing this news, Zhao Fuxiang crossed mountains and valleys to find the Military Affairs Department Director Li Zhonghua, spoke highly of his son, and enlisted him. Thus, his gate had four honor plaques.

After sending his four sons to the army, Zhao Fuxiang gave them four rules: first, to listen to the Party; second, not to do anything illegal or disorderly; third, to respect leaders and unite with comrades; and fourth, to strive for merit and awards every year.

Two years ago, Zhao Chengbao, seeing the family's difficulties, wanted to leave the army. After learning about this, Zhao Fuxiang specially went to the army and scolded his eldest son, telling him to follow the Party's arrangements.

The eldest son, Zhao Chengbao, did not forget his father's instructions, practiced his combat skills diligently, and performed excellently in a combined arms exercise, earning a third-class merit citation and being promoted to quartermaster. The second son, Zhao Chenggui, is a supply clerk in a certain unit. On New Year's Eve this year, with the help of his comrades, he caught four thieves and was commended by his superiors. Later, he joined the Party and became a volunteer soldier. The third son, Zhao Chengming, has been commended many times and was rated as a "good squad leader." The fourth son, Zhao Chengliang, has just enlisted this year. In less than a month, he was promoted to deputy squad leader of the new recruits.

    为了国家的安宁
    ——记农民赵福祥送四子入伍
    孔凡民　王桂安
    赵福祥是济南市彩石乡三泉峪村的农民，现已年过半百。15年前，他老伴去世，撇下“宝、贵、明、亮”4个儿子，还有白发苍苍的母亲。这些年来，在他的抚养下，孩子们一个个长大成人了。
    1981年征兵时节，18岁的大儿子赵成宝开拖拉机外出没有回来，赵福祥便替他报了名。有些好心人说：“老赵，你家成宝是全村第一个有执照的拖拉机手，最挣钱。你把摇钱树往外扔，何苦！”赵福祥说：“要是国家不安宁，摇钱树又有什么用！”大儿子通过体检、政审合格，入伍通知书发下来了。他对父亲说：“爹，我走后，奶奶、弟弟都得靠您了”。
    赵福祥望着儿子深情地说：你只管放心走，到了部队要好好干，为家乡父老争光。至于家里，天塌下来有我顶着。等你弟弟们长大了，我还叫他们到部队去。你第一个当兵，要带个好头！
    大儿子走后，赵福祥忍痛把儿子开过的拖拉机卖掉，供养家里的3个儿子上学。
    1982年中越边境战事不断。当年恰逢赵福祥的二儿子赵成贵高中毕业，赵福祥又让他参了军。赵家的门楼上多了一块光荣牌。
    有的人听赵福祥常说“保卫共和国”的大道理，便问他：“难道你能让第三个儿子再去当兵不成！”1986年，赵福祥又将初中毕业后，学会了瓦工活的老三赵成明送到了部队。
    今年年初，赵福祥的母亲去世。四儿子成亮已18岁，说是要向3个哥哥学习，到部队去保卫祖国。彩石乡人民政府和武装部考虑到老赵有实际困难，不想让他第四个儿子入伍。赵福祥听到这消息后，翻山越岭找到武装部长李中华，说了许多好话，替儿子报了名，从而，他的门楼上挂了4块光荣牌。
    赵福祥把4个儿子送到部队后，还给他们约法4章：一是要听党的话，二是不准做违法乱纪的事，三是要尊重领导、团结同志，四是要每年立功受奖。
    前年，赵成宝见家中困难，想离开部队。赵福祥知道这事后，专门去部队一趟，说了大儿子一顿，叫他听从党安排。
    大儿子赵成宝不忘父亲的嘱托，苦练杀敌本领，在一次合成军作战练习中表现突出，荣立三等功，被提为司务长。二儿子赵成贵在某部是保管员，今年大年三十夜里，在战友们的协助下抓了4个小偷，受到上级通报表扬。以后他还入了党，转成了志愿兵。三儿子赵成明多次受到嘉奖，还被评为“好班长”。四儿子赵成亮今年刚入伍，不到一个月，就被提为新兵班副班长。
