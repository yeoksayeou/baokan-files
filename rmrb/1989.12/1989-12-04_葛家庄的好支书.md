In 1988, the per capita income in Gejiazhuang Village, Xingtai City, Hebei Province, was 1,250 yuan, three times higher than in 1980. Villagers who want to learn culture have a farmers' night school, those who want entertainment have an activity room, and those who want to read have a reading room. The bustling life here is even better than that of city dwellers!

Gejiazhuang Village has achieved today's prosperity thanks to the efforts of the village party branch secretary, Chen Weidong, who led the villagers to work hard and get rich.

In the spring of 1985, the village party members elected Chen Weidong as the secretary. As a party member, Chen Weidong felt he could not shirk this responsibility. He gave up a lucrative opportunity he had found and took on the job.

At that time, the village had two major problems: first, out of seven wells, five were not usable, leading to disputes among the villagers over water for irrigation; second, a flour mill, which had been built with an investment of 600,000 yuan, was on the verge of bankruptcy, owing 320,000 yuan in debt!

Chen Weidong tackled these two "hotspots." He led the villagers to quickly repair the five wells and decided that the water and electricity fees for irrigation would be paid by the village, which pleased the villagers. Then, Chen Weidong found a way to partner with the Beijing Flour Mill, reviving the flour mill. To expand the market for the flour, he traveled to Shanxi and Henan provinces. The flour mill made a profit of 540,000 yuan that year!

The revival of the flour mill boosted Chen Weidong's confidence. Through the China Chemical Society, he learned about the promising market for chemical additives. He then purchased a patent and invested 800,000 yuan to build a chemical additives factory, which made a profit of 450,000 yuan annually. Now, Gejiazhuang has more than ten enterprises, with a net annual income of over 1.4 million yuan.

Last year, Gejiazhuang had more than 20 acres of fallow land. To strengthen agriculture, Chen Weidong, on one hand, assigned experienced laborers to agricultural production and organized a farm service team of 32 women. On the other hand, the village invested in purchasing more than 40 pieces of farm machinery, including tractors, seeders, and harvesters, making agricultural production from planting to harvesting basically mechanized.

Gejiazhuang has become prosperous. In recent years, the village has established a farmers' night school, an activity room, a reading room, and more. Every household has a television and a tape recorder. Family planning has been a model in the city and district, and the village's appearance has been greatly improved. There have been no criminal or public security cases for three consecutive years. In July of this year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government awarded Chen Weidong the honorable title of "Agricultural Labor Model."

    葛家庄的好支书
    曹先锋
    河北省邢台市葛家庄村，1988年人均收入1250元，比1980年翻了三番。农民想学文化有农民夜校，想娱乐有活动室，想看书有阅览室，……红火火的日子比起城里人的日子还强呢！
    葛家庄村有今天，村党支书陈卫东带领群众勤劳致富，立下功劳。
    1985年春，村里的党员们推选陈卫东当支书。作为一名党员，陈卫东觉得无可推卸。他抛弃已经找到的发财门路，走马上任了。
    当时，村里有两件棘手事：一是村里7眼机井5眼机井不能用，群众为争水浇地纠纷成堆；二是投资60万元建起的面粉厂面临倒闭，欠债32万元！
    陈评东就从这两个“热点”动手。他领着大伙，很快把5眼机井修好了，而且决定群众浇地的水电费由村里统一支付，群众乐了。接着，陈卫东找门路与北京面粉厂联营，救活了面粉厂。为扩大面粉的销路，他上山西、下河南。面粉厂当年就创利54万元！
    面粉厂起死回生增添了陈卫东的信心。他通过中国化学协会了解到生产化学助剂市场前景大，于是购买了一项专利，投资80万元，建起了化学助剂厂，年创利45万元。现在，葛家庄已拥有十多个企业，年纯收入达140多万元。
    去年，葛家庄出现了20多亩荒田。为了加强农业，陈卫东一方面抽调有种植经验的劳力投入农业生产，组织起了有32名妇女参加的农田服务队，同时村里投资购买了拖拉机、播种机、收割机等40多台件农机具，使农业生产从种到收基本上实现了机械化。
    葛家庄富了。近年来，村里陆续办起了农民夜校、娱乐室、阅览室等。全村家家户户都有了电视机、录音机。计划生育一直是市、区先进单位，村风村貌焕然一新，连续三年无刑事案件和治安案件发生。今年7月，河北省人民政府授予陈卫东“农业劳动模范”的光荣称号。
