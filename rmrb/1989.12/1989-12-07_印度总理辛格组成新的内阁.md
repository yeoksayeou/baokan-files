Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh formed a new cabinet on December 5th, consisting of fifteen ministers and two ministers of state.

Due to the Indian People's Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) insisting on not joining the government but supporting the new government, all cabinet ministers come from the five-party National Front. Singh himself will serve as the Minister of Defense, and Inder Kumar Gujral will serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The cabinet ministers took their oaths of office in the evening of the 5th at the presidential palace under the chairmanship of President Venkataraman.
