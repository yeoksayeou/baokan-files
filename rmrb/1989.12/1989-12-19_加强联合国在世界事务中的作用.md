For many years, the United Nations has been seen as a large "international forum" where representatives of various countries can freely discuss issues, but rarely solve practical problems.

In recent years, the United Nations has taken action to change this perception. Especially in promoting the resolution of difficult regional conflicts, the United Nations has achieved significant results. These regional conflicts often drag on for years, and various countries, either through mediation or pressure, have not been able to stop them. However, through mediation and negotiation, the United Nations has either helped the relevant parties reach political solutions or move towards peaceful resolutions. Many regional hotspots have cooled down, saving countless lives. This year, the United Nations, building on its existing achievements, continues to push for the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts. This is an important contribution by the United Nations to maintaining regional stability and world peace, and it has been praised by the vast majority of countries in the world. The strengthening of the United Nations' role is undoubtedly related to its unique position, but more importantly, it is due to the needs of the developing international situation.

In recent years, the international situation has been easing, although there have been setbacks this year, it is still moving in this direction. Factors that maintain peace and prevent war continue to increase, and the use of war as a means to resolve conflicts is increasingly unpopular. The two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, after years of arms race and direct intervention in regional disputes, have faced strong opposition from the peoples of various countries in the world, and they themselves are also unable to sustain it. In this situation, both sides have had to adjust their strategies, moving from long-term confrontation to dialogue. They seek political solutions to regional conflict issues, aiming to extricate themselves from these war-torn regions. As for the countries and regions involved in these conflicts, after years of war, the loss of life and property is enormous, economic development has regressed, and national security is not guaranteed. They are also willing to resolve disputes peacefully. However, how can regional conflicts seek peaceful solutions? The method of a few superpowers sitting together to decide the fate of other countries has failed, and the parties involved in the regional conflicts are also difficult to reconcile in a short time. Therefore, it is most appropriate for the United Nations, an international organization that is above the fray, to mediate.

For the United Nations itself, the strengthening of its role is closely related to the trend of the Security Council gradually coordinating and unifying. For a long time, the two superpowers within the Security Council have either tried to single-handedly control the United Nations or have opposed each other and abused the veto power, causing the United Nations to have differing opinions and be difficult to function.

In the past two years, the five permanent members of the Security Council have first consulted on some major issues, then listened to the opinions of the other 10 non-permanent members, and also considered the wishes of other member states of the United Nations. Finally, the draft resolution is submitted to the Security Council for discussion, voted on, and implemented. This consultative action has strengthened the position and authority of the Security Council, helping the United Nations to play a role in resolving regional conflicts.

It is under the long-term mediation and comprehensive supervision of the United Nations that Namibia began its transition to independence this year. The people of Namibia recently elected a constituent assembly and will formally declare independence next April. The independence of the last colonial territory on the African continent will make the long-turbulent southern African region tend towards peace and stability, which is particularly commendable to the international community.

There is reason to hope that the Security Council, especially the permanent members, will continue to take practical actions in the future to uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and fulfill their responsibilities to ensure peace and security.

The United Nations has achieved significant results in resolving regional conflicts, but regional conflicts have not yet been completely resolved:

In particular, in the Cambodian issue, Vietnam still stubbornly refuses to accept the withdrawal of troops under United Nations supervision;

The United Nations has played a certain role in promoting disarmament, but the goal of disarmament is far from being achieved;

Many institutions within the United Nations system have played a role in providing economic aid, technological projects, refugee relief, and disaster assistance to developing countries, but in helping developing countries solve major economic problems such as the debt crisis, they have basically remained stagnant;

Some global social and economic issues such as environmental pollution, global warming, and drug problems have just begun to attract attention.

People generally expect that the United Nations, the most influential international organization, will play a greater role in global affairs in the last 10 years of the 20th century, making greater contributions to maintaining peace and promoting development.

### 加强联合国在世界事务中的作用

    加强联合国在世界事务中的作用
    本报记者　刘开宸
    多年来，联合国一直被视为一个大型“国际论坛”，各国代表可以自由议论，但很少解决实际问题。
    近几年，联合国以自己的行动，改变了人们的看法。特别是在促进解决棘手的地区冲突问题上，联合国取得了显著的成果。这些地区冲突往往延绵多年，一些国家或是调解，或是施压，都未能使之中止。但联合国通过斡旋与调停，使有关方面或达成了政治解决的协议，或走上了和平解决之路。许多地区“热点”降温了，挽救了无数人的生命。今年，联合国在巩固已有成果的基础上，继续推动和平解决地区冲突问题向前发展。这是联合国为维护地区安定和世界和平所作的重要贡献，因而受到世界上绝大多数国家的赞扬。联合国作用的加强，固然同它的独特地位有关，但更重要的是由于国际形势发展的需要。
    几年来，国际形势趋于缓和，今年虽有波折，但仍朝这一方向发展。维护和平、制止战争的因素继续增加，以战争作为解决利害冲突的手段日益不得人心。美、苏两个超级大国经过多年的军备竞赛和直接插手地区争夺，遭到世界各国人民的强烈反对，其本身也力不从心。在此情况下，两家被迫进行战略调整，从长期对抗走向对话。它们寻求地区冲突问题的政治解决，旨在从这些战乱频仍的地区中摆脱出来。至于卷入这些冲突的国家和地区多年战乱之后，生命财产损失惊人，经济发展倒退，国家安全毫无保障。它们也愿意以和平方式体面地解决争端。但是，地区冲突如何寻求和平解决呢？靠一两个超级大国坐在一起谋划如何决定别国命运的作法已经失灵了，参与地区冲突的各方一时也难以握手言和。因此，由超脱国际机构——联合国出面调停，是最合适不过的了。
    对联合国本身来说，其作用的加强与安理会逐步协调一致的趋向有密切关系。长期以来，安理会内的两个超级大国，或企图单独操纵联合国，或相互对抗而滥用否决权，使联合国意见分歧，很难发挥作用。
    近两年，安理会5个常任理事国对一些重大问题首先磋商，然后听取其它10个非常任理事国的意见，并且考虑联合国其它成员国的意愿，最后议案提交安理会讨论，表决后付诸实施。这种协商行动的作法，加强了安理会的地位和权威性，有助于联合国在解决地区冲突方面发挥作用。
    正是在联合国的长期调停和全面监督下，纳米比亚今年开始向独立过渡。纳米比亚人民最近选出了制宪议会，并将于明年4月正式宣告独立。非洲大陆上最后一块殖民地的独立，将使多年动荡的南部非洲地区趋向和平与安定，这是尤为国际社会称道之事。
    人们有理由希望，安理会全体理事国、特别是常任理事国，今后应继续以实际行动遵守联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，为保障和平与安全履行自己的责任。
    联合国在解决地区冲突问题上成绩是显著的，但地区冲突迄今尚未完全解决：
    特别是在柬埔寨问题上，越南还在顽固地拒绝接受联合国监督下的撤军；
    联合国在裁军领域里起了一定的推动作用，但裁军的目标远未实现；
    联合国系统的许多机构在向发展中国家提供经济援助、科技项目、救济难民、援助灾区中起了不少作用，但在帮助发展中国家解决债务危机等重大经济问题方面，基本上裹足不前；
    一些全球性的社会和经济问题如环境污染、气候变暖、吸毒问题等才刚刚引起注意。
    人们普遍期待，联合国这个最有影响的国际组织，在即将来临的20世纪的最后10年里，在世界事务中发挥更大的作用，为维护和平、促进发展做出更大的贡献。
