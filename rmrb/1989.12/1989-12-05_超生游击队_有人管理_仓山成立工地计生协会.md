Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 4th — (Reporter Yu Changhong) The leader of an out-of-town construction team becomes the director of a construction site family planning association—this novel occurrence in Cangshan District, Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, indicates that China's urban floating population family planning work has created a new approach where the floating population manages itself.

In recent years, Cangshan District has seen a significant increase in its floating population, with out-of-town construction teams being the most numerous. These floating populations are far from their registered residences, and many have become "supernumerary guerrilla squads." Previously, relying solely on inspections, training, and fines had limited effectiveness.

Since this year, Cangshan District has focused on coordinating efforts from housing management, construction, labor services, public security, and individual laborer associations to jointly manage the family planning of the floating population, leading to a new situation. Various systems and units within the district have signed family planning contracts with out-of-town construction teams to ensure that the floating population does not have unplanned births. In August, the first construction site family planning association was established on the construction site of the Cangshan District Comprehensive Construction Office. The family planning association is based on the construction site, ensuring that the floating population has management for family planning. From January to October this year, Cangshan District had no unplanned births and was rated as a red flag unit by the province and city.

    “超生游击队”有人管理
    仓山成立工地计生协会
    据新华社福州12月4日电　（记者于长洪）外来建筑队头头当上工地计划生育协会理事——发生在福建省福州市仓山区的这桩新鲜事表明，我国城市流动人口计划生育工作已经创出外流人口自己管理自己的新路子。
    福州市仓山区近年来流动人口大量增加，尤以外来建筑队最多。流动人口远离户籍所在地，很多成为“超生游击队”。以前仅靠查、训、罚收效不大。
    今年以来，仓山区注意协调房管、建工、劳动服务、公安、个体劳动者协会等各方面齐抓共管，外流人口计划生育管理工作出现新局面。区内各系统、单位与外来建筑队签订计划生育合同，以保证外来人口无计划外生育。8月份，在仓山区统筹建设办公室工地上成立了第一个工地计划生育协会。计生协会建在工地上，使外流人口计划生育有人管理。今年1—10月份，仓山区无一个计划外生育，被评为省、市的红旗单位。
