People's Daily, London, December 6th, Reporter Chen Te'an:

In the first Conservative Party leadership election in 14 years, Mrs. Thatcher last night secured a "crushing" victory over her challenger, Sir Anthony Meyer, with 314 votes to 33. This ensures her continued leadership of the Conservative Party.

After the secret ballot results were announced yesterday, Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth Baker stated that the voting results clearly indicate that the "leadership issue has now been resolved." He added, "The Conservative Party has decided that Margaret Thatcher will lead the party into the 1990s and the next general election."

Local opinion holds that the election results give Mrs. Thatcher some leeway in dealing with issues such as inflation, European affairs, and East-West relations.

    英保守党领袖选举结束
    撒切尔夫人获胜
    本报伦敦12月6日电　记者陈特安报道：在14年来第一次保守党领袖选举中，撒切尔夫人昨晚以314票对33票的“压倒性”多数，取得对其挑战者安东尼·迈耶爵士的胜利，从而保住了保守党领袖地位。
    在昨天无记名投票揭晓后，保守党主席肯尼索·贝克说，投票结果已清楚表明“领袖问题现在已经解决”，“保守党已经决定，要由玛格丽特·撒切尔来领导党进入90年代和下届大选”。
    此间舆论认为，选举结果，使撒切尔夫人在对付通货膨胀、欧洲问题、东西方关系问题等方面有了一定的回旋余地。
