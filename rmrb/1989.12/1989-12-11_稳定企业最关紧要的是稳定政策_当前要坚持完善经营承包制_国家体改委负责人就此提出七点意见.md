The Most Crucial Thing for Stabilizing Enterprises is Stabilizing Policies
Currently, We Must Persist in and Improve the Contract Responsibility System
A Responsible Official from the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System Proposes Seven Points of Opinion

New China News Agency, Beijing, December 10 — (Reporter Xú Kèhóng) Vice Chairman of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, Hè Guānghuī, recently stated in an interview with a reporter that, given the current temporary difficulties in China's economy, the most crucial thing for stabilizing enterprises is stabilizing policies, ensuring the continuity of policies, and persisting in and improving the enterprise contract responsibility system.

Over the past 10 years of reform practice, China's enterprise reform has gone through a process from expanding enterprise operational autonomy, implementing profit retention, tax-for-profit reform, and promoting economic responsibility systems, to finally developing the enterprise contract responsibility system. This process has transformed from reducing taxes and providing benefits to changing the operational mechanism. By directly linking the success or failure of enterprise operations with the interests of the enterprise and the workers, it has achieved a good balance of responsibility, authority, and benefits under the premise of maintaining public ownership, effectively handling the relationship between the state and the enterprise. This transformation is a substantial change. It can be said that the enterprise contract system is a creation of government departments at all levels, enterprises, and the broad masses in the reform practice, and it is also a realistic choice under the current economic conditions.

Hè Guānghuī said that in the next two years, nearly 90% of enterprise contracts will expire. We should continue to persist in the enterprise contract responsibility system, while seriously summarizing experiences, eliminating disadvantages, and continuously improving it. While persisting in and improving the contract system, we should actively explore other operational forms.

Recently, many enterprises have faced significant operational difficulties due to large changes in the external environment, and operators are under too much pressure and do not want to continue with the contract. Hè Guānghuī said that there are issues of both recognition and reality here. However, this situation tells us that now there is not only the question of whether to let the operators continue with the contract, but also the question of whether the operators are willing to continue with the contract. From the perspective of stabilizing the overall economy, we must persuade them to overcome difficulties and continue with the contract. Some provinces and cities have already clearly stated that during the period of rectification and adjustment, they will implement a new round of contracts or extend the contract period, which is beneficial for stabilizing enterprises and the economy.

Regarding how to further improve and reform the contract system, Hè Guānghuī proposed seven points of opinion:

First, according to the standardized contract methods stipulated in the "Contract Regulations," ensure stable growth of fiscal revenue and enhance the enterprise's development momentum. In the future, for enterprises that comply with the state's industrial policies and need development, especially for several hundred key enterprises that have strategic significance for the long-term stable development of the national economy, we can adopt the "two guarantees and one linkage" contract form, which includes guaranteeing the amount of profit handed over, guaranteeing the technical transformation tasks, and linking wages with efficiency. The amount of profit handed over mainly adopts the methods of incremental profit guarantee or base profit guarantee and profit-sharing above the base. The contract period can be determined according to the technical transformation tasks, generally 3-5 years. Other general processing enterprises can continue to implement the current contract methods or conduct "tax and profit separation, post-tax contract" pilot projects.

Second, reasonably determine the contract base number and advocate contributing more to the state. After the enterprise contract expires, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the fiscal handover indicators and incremental rates. There are mainly three situations: First, for enterprises with a profit rate significantly lower than the average of the same industry in the region, it indicates poor management, and the fiscal handover indicators and incremental rates should be appropriately increased to urge improvement; for enterprises with a profit rate significantly higher than the average of the same industry in the region, it indicates good management, and the fiscal handover indicators and incremental rates can be appropriately reduced to promote development. If fiscal difficulties prevent a reduction, it should be made clear that this is the enterprise's additional contribution to the state. Second, for enterprises that have completed technical transformation tasks with relatively large investments in the previous contract period, the fiscal handover indicators or incremental rates should be appropriately increased to promote the enterprise to play its role. Third, for enterprises that need to be developed according to industrial policies, the fiscal handover indicators should be appropriately reduced based on calculations, and the remaining profits should be used to complete technical transformation tasks. In this way, although the fiscal revenue is reduced, the expenditure is also reduced; for enterprises that do not need to be developed, the fiscal handover indicators should be appropriately increased. The three situations listed here, whether the fiscal revenue is increased or decreased, will be beneficial to the stable growth of fiscal revenue and will help to overcome the problem of "whipping the fast cow."

Third, reasonably use the enterprise's retained profits and increase the proportion of production development funds. Given the current situation, it is necessary to clarify the following two principles: First, the sequence of using the enterprise's retained profits should be to prioritize working capital and technical transformation, followed by welfare funds and reward funds; second, regardless of the amount of retained profits, a certain proportion should be reserved for enterprise development to avoid short-term behavior. Since the retained profit levels of various enterprises are currently very different, local authorities should, based on these two principles, set specific proportions for production development funds in tiers, and enterprises are not allowed to occupy them privately, so as to increase the "rigidity" of production development funds.

Fourth, improve the evaluation indicator system and correctly guide enterprise behavior. The contract must comply with the requirements of the "Contract Regulations." In addition to evaluating the realization of profits, the amount of profits handed over, and the incremental rate and profit-sharing ratio above the base, it is also necessary to seriously evaluate various indicators of technological progress and enterprise management, and strictly implement rewards and punishments.

Fifth, improve the wage-efficiency linkage method and control the rapid growth of consumption funds. According to statistics, for enterprises that have been approved by the state to implement wage-efficiency linkage, the annual incremental rate of profits and taxes handed over from 1985 to 1987 was 13.5%, and the annual incremental rate of total wages was 11.3%; for enterprises that did not implement wage-efficiency linkage, the annual incremental rate of profits and taxes handed over in the same period was only 6.8%, but the annual incremental rate of total wages was 15.5%. The comparison of these two sets of data shows that enterprises with wage-efficiency linkage are better than those without linkage and indeed play a role in restraining the growth of consumption funds, which should be continued. What needs to be further improved is that the linkage coefficient should be determined based on the average economic benefit level of the same industry in the region, and the floating proportion of total wages should be reasonably determined, so that the comparison between enterprises is more reasonable, and a certain reserve fund should be considered to supplement the deficit, strictly controlling the growth of consumption funds.

Sixth, improve the reward and punishment methods for operators and prevent operators from having unreasonably high incomes. To this end, the following principles should be adhered to: First, the income of operators must be audited before it can be paid; second, the income of operators must include all types of allowances and individual bonuses; third, the income of operators should not exceed three times the average income of the enterprise's employees, and within this limit, local authorities should formulate specific conditions and evaluation methods; fourth, the income distribution plan for operators and other members of the contract leadership team must be discussed and approved by the workers' congress and reported to the superior authorities for approval, increasing transparency; fifth, the method of leaving or sharing profits above the base for operators should be canceled; sixth, in existing contract enterprises, if the income of operators exceeds the limit stipulated in the "Contract Regulations," the excess part should be included in the production development fund or establish an enterprise risk fund.

Seventh, the enterprise contract plan must be discussed by the workers' congress to fully absorb the opinions of the broad masses of workers, and establish and improve the democratic supervision system, embodying the role of the workers as masters, and enhancing the sense of responsibility as masters.

    稳定企业最关紧要的是稳定政策
    当前要坚持完善经营承包制
    国家体改委负责人就此提出七点意见
    新华社北京12月10日电　（记者徐克洪）国家体改委副主任贺光辉近日在向记者发表谈话时指出，在目前我国经济遇到暂时困难的情况下，稳定企业最关紧要的是稳定政策，注意政策的连续性，坚持和完善企业经营承包责任制。
    在过去10年的改革实践中，我国的企业改革从扩大企业经营自主权、实行利润留成、利改税、推行经济责任制，最终发展到企业承包经营责任制，经历了一个从减税让利发展到转变经营机制的过程。把企业经营成果好坏的责任，与企业利益和职工利益直接挂起钩来，做到在坚持公有制的前提下责、权、利相结合，较好地处理了国家和企业的关系。上述转变过程是一个实质性的变化，可以说企业承包制是各级政府部门、企业和广大群众在改革实践中的创造，也是在当前经济条件下的现实选择。
    贺光辉说，今明两年内有将近90％的企业承包合同到期。应当继续坚持企业承包经营责任制，同时要认真总结经验，兴利除弊，不断加以完善。在坚持和完善承包制的同时，要积极探索其他经营形式。
    最近，不少企业由于外部环境变化太大，生产经营困难很多，经营者压力过大而不愿意再承包下去了。贺光辉说，这里有认识问题，也有实际问题。但这种情况告诉我们，现在不仅有一个要不要让经营者继续承包的问题，同时还有一个经营者愿不愿意继续承包的问题。从稳定经济的大局出发，要说服他们克服困难，继续承包下去。有些省、市已明确在治理整顿期间实行新的一轮承包，或延续承包期，这对稳定企业、稳定经济是有好处的。
    对于如何进一步完善和改进承包制的问题，贺光辉提出7点意见：
    第一，按照《承包条例》规范的承包办法，保证财政收入稳定增长，增强企业发展后劲。今后，对于符合国家产业政策，需要发展的企业，特别是对几百户对国民经济长期稳定发展有战略意义的大型骨干企业，可以采取一包上交利润，二包技术改造任务，实行工效挂钩的“两包一挂”承包形式。上交利润主要采取上交利润递增包干或基数利润包干、超基数利润分成的办法。承包期可以根据技术改造任务确定，一般3—5年。其它一般加工企业可继续实行现行承包办法，也可进行“税利分流、税后承包”试点。
      第二，合理确定承包基数，提倡为国家多作贡献。企业承包到期后，需要对财政上交指标和递增比例作适当调整。主要有三种情况：一是利润率明显低于本地区同行业平均水平的企业，说明它经营管理差，要适当调高财政上交指标和递增率，加以鞭策；利润率明显高于本地区同行业平均水平的企业，说明它经营管理好，可适当调低财政上交指标和递增率，促其发展。如果财政困难，不能调低，也应当摆在明处，说清楚这是企业对国家多做的贡献。二是前一个承包期已用较多的投入完成了技术改造任务的企业，应适当调高财政上交指标或递增率，促进企业发挥效益。三是按照产业政策需要发展的企业，应当在算帐的基础上适当调低财政上交指标，留下的利润用于完成技术改造任务，这样财政虽然少收了，但同时也少支了；不需要发展的企业，应当适当调高财政上交指标。这里列举的三种情况，不论是财政多收还是财政少支，都会有利于财政收入的稳定增长，也有利于克服“鞭打快牛”的问题。
    第三，合理使用企业留利，提高生产发展基金比例。针对当前情况，需要明确这样两条原则：一是企业留利的使用顺序，应当是先流动资金和技术改造，后福利基金和奖励基金；二是企业留利不论多少，都要留出一定比例用于企业发展，克服短期行为。由于现在各个企业的留利水平差距很大，各地应根据这两项原则，对生产发展基金定出分档次的具体比例，企业不准自行挤占，以便提高生产发展基金的“刚性”。
    第四，健全考核指标体系，正确引导企业行为。承包合同必须符合《承包条例》的要求，除考核实现利润、上交利润及其递增率、超收分成比例以外，还要认真考核技术进步和企业管理的各项指标，并严格兑现奖惩。
    第五，完善工效挂钩办法，控制消费基金过快增长。据统计，经国家批准实行工效挂钩的企业，1985年至1987年上交利税年递增13.5％，工资总额年递增11.3％；没有实行工效挂钩的企业，同期上交利税年递增只有6.8％，工资总额年递增却为15.5％。这两组数据的对比说明，工效挂钩的企业比不挂钩的企业好，确实起到了约束消费基金增长的作用，应当坚持下去。需要进一步完善的是，挂钩系数要参照本地区同行业经济效益的平均水平确定，合理确定工资总额浮动比例，使各企业横向之间比较更趋于合理，并考虑留有一定的后备基金以丰补欠，严格控制消费基金增长。
    第六，完善对经营者的奖惩办法，防止经营者不合理的过高收入。为此，需要坚持以下几项原则：一是经营者的收入必须先审计、后兑现；二是经营者的收入必须包括各种津贴、单项奖等全部收入；三是经营者收入最多不高于本企业职工平均收入的三倍，在此限度内，各地要制定具体条件和考核办法；四是经营者和承包领导班子其他成员的收入分配方案，必须经过职工代表大会审议，报上级主管部门批准，增加透明度；五是取消对经营者收入实行超基数留成或分成的办法；六是现有承包企业中，经营者收入超过《承包条例》规定限额的，超过部分一律纳入生产发展基金或建立企业风险基金。
      第七，企业承包方案必须通过职工代表大会讨论，充分吸收广大职工的意见，并建立和健全民主监督制度，体现职工的主人翁地位，增强当家作主的责任感。
