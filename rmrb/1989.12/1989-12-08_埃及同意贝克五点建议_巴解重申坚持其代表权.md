People's Daily, Cairo, December 7th - Correspondent Lin Jiaoming reports: The Egyptian government has given its formal response to the U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's five-point proposal. The foreign ministers of Egypt, the United States, and Israel may meet in Washington early next year to prepare for direct talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali announced yesterday that Egypt's formal response to the Baker five-point plan has been sent to the U.S. government. The newspaper *Al-Ahram* today revealed that Egypt's position "is consistent with the Palestinian position," but it did not report the details of the response.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Margaret Tutwiler confirmed on the 6th that Egypt's response had been received, describing Egypt's acceptance of the Baker plan as "positive," and noting that there had been "new progress" in the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. She predicted that the foreign ministers of Egypt, the U.S., and Israel might hold talks in Washington in early January to discuss direct talks between the Palestinians and Israelis in Cairo. At the same time, she acknowledged that many issues remain to be resolved.

Local sources believe that even if the foreign ministers of Egypt, Israel, and the U.S. hold a meeting, they will still face two major obstacles: the composition of the Palestinian delegation and the agenda for the talks. Israel last week "conditionally accepted the Baker proposal," but stated that it would not negotiate with the PLO representatives, limiting the agenda to the issue of elections in the occupied territories. The PLO handed over its response to the Baker proposal to the U.S. on the 4th, insisting on the PLO's representative rights throughout the entire negotiation process, with no restrictions on the agenda. The Egyptian government has repeatedly emphasized that it will not make any decisions on behalf of the PLO, advocating for a Palestinian delegation that includes representatives from both inside and outside the occupied territories. The positions of the Palestinians and Israelis still have a considerable gap.

According to other reports, Egyptian First Deputy Prime Minister Atef Sedki informed Yasser Arafat, who was passing through Cairo, of the situation regarding the talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly and Egypt. He announced that Arafat would visit Cairo in the near future. Palestinian sources said that the PLO does not believe that the U.S. will change its attitude towards the PLO and the self-determination of the Palestinian people in the near future. The flexibility of the PLO's position is based on its unchanging representative rights.

PLO leader Abu Ala recently stated that if the U.S. five-point plan could guarantee the PLO's participation in negotiations with Israel, then the PLO would agree to the plan.

### 埃及同意贝克五点建议  巴解重申坚持其代表权

    埃及同意贝克五点建议  巴解重申坚持其代表权
    本报开罗12月7日电　记者林皎明报道：埃及政府对美国贝克5点建议做出正式答复。埃及、美国、以色列3国外长可能明年初在华盛顿会晤，筹备举行巴以直接对话。
    埃及外交部长马吉德昨天宣布，埃及对贝克5点计划的正式答复已经送交美国政府。《金字塔报》今天透露，埃及立场“与巴勒斯坦立场一致”，但它没有报道答复的细节。
    美国国务院发言人塔勒怀特6日证实收到埃及答复，认为埃及同意贝克计划的立场是“积极的”，巴以对话“有新进展”。这位女发言人预计，埃美以3国外长可能于明年1月初在华盛顿举行会谈，商讨巴以开罗直接对话。同时，她承认仍有许多问题有待解决。
    此间人士认为，埃以美3国外长会议即使召开，也面临着巴勒斯坦代表团组成和对话议题两个棘手难题。以色列上周“有条件接受贝克建议”，但声明不与巴解代表谈判，对话议题限于被占领土选举问题。巴解组织4日将对贝克建议的答复交给美国，坚持巴解组织在全部和谈过程中的代表权，议题不加限定。埃及政府多次强调不替代巴解组织做任何决定，主张巴代表团有被占领土内外代表参加。巴以立场仍然有相当距离。
    另据消息报道，埃及第一国务秘书巴兹5日向途经开罗的阿拉法特主席通报美国助理国务卿凯利与埃及会谈情况。他宣布，阿拉法特主席近期访问开罗。巴勒斯坦消息说，巴解组织不认为美国近期会改变对巴解组织和巴人民自决权的态度。巴解组织立场的灵活性基于自己不可改变的代表权。
    巴解领导人哈拉夫最近表示，如果美国的5点计划能保证巴解参加与以色列的谈判，那么巴解将同意这一计划。
