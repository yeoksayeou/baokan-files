A project known as the "1751 Project," which involves the promotion of agricultural technology, is being vigorously implemented in the Handan region of Hebei Province. Since this winter, leaders at all levels in the Handan region have gone to the countryside to implement plans, aiming to build 10 million mu of high-yield, high-efficiency farmland for wheat and cotton.

The integration of wheat and cotton is a new agricultural technology that has been successfully developed in recent years. It utilizes early-maturing, high-yield wheat varieties and summer-planted cotton technology to achieve two crops of wheat and cotton per year, thereby increasing the output efficiency of cultivated land. The "1751 Project" in the Handan region specifically aims to achieve a yield of 700 jin of wheat and 500 jin of cotton per mu, with an income of 1,000 yuan per mu.

Currently, tens of thousands of officials from across the region have gone to the countryside to implement plans. According to incomplete statistics from 10 counties, 40,000 tons of chemical fertilizer and 2,300 tons of diesel have been allocated to rural areas. The entire region is also conducting large-scale training on wheat-cotton integration technology, organizing more than 750 training sessions, with over 250,000 households participating. The Handan "1751 Project" involves 12 counties and 2,523 villages. In the plan, they pay attention to relatively concentrated and contiguous cultivated land, with hundreds of mu or thousands of mu in one area, establishing land records, and decentralized management. In terms of seeds, mechanized farming, fertilization, irrigation, and pest control, unified services are provided.

    各级干部下乡落实规划
    邯郸建设百万亩高产农田
    本报讯　记者高保生报道：一项被称为“1751工程”的农业科技推广项目，正在河北省邯郸地区抓紧实施。今冬以来，邯郸地区各级领导下乡落实规划，建设100万亩麦棉一体化高产高效益农田。
    麦棉一体化是近年开发成功的一项农业新技术。它利用早熟高产小麦品种和夏播棉新技术，可使耕地年产麦棉两季，从而提高耕地产出效益。邯郸地区的“1751工程”，具体目标是在100万亩耕地上实现亩产小麦700市斤，籽棉500市斤，亩效益1000元。
    目前，全地区有几万名干部下乡落实规划。据10个县不完全统计，已调拨4万吨化肥、2300吨柴油供应农村。全区还开展大规模麦棉一体化技术培训，共办750多场次培训班，有25万多农户参加。邯郸“1751工程”涉及12个县，2523个村。在规划中，他们注意做到耕地相对集中连片，上百亩、上千亩一方，建立土地档案，分散经营，在种子、机耕、施肥、浇水、治虫等方面实行统一服务。
