According to today's issue of the *Market News*, Henan Province has rectified and regulated its tobacco market, and the procurement work is gradually returning to normal. However, at the same time, issues such as the lack of bottom leaves, top leaves not being dried, and premature tobacco pulling have emerged, which may have adverse effects on next year's tobacco planting.

Henan is one of China's major tobacco-producing regions, with its output accounting for one-quarter of the national total. The "tobacco leaf wars" of the past two years have led to an overly rapid expansion of tobacco planting areas, causing chaos in the tobacco market, with phenomena such as grade inflation, price inflation, and adulteration and counterfeiting, resulting in significant losses to the state. This year, relevant departments have carried out rectification and regulation, strictly implementing the tobacco monopoly system, and tobacco leaves are procured uniformly by relevant departments according to national standards, significantly improving market order.

It should be noted that the "tobacco leaf wars" of the past two years have allowed some farmers to obtain some illegitimate income. This year, with procurement according to national standards, farmers are no longer able to obtain money they are not entitled to, exposing long-standing unreasonable price issues: first, the tobacco-grain price ratio is unreasonable, and some farmers feel that growing tobacco is not as profitable as growing grain; second, the cost of flue-cured tobacco production has increased, and some farmers feel that it is better to pull out the tobacco to save trouble than to incur losses by drying it.

Experts suggest that appropriate measures should be taken to avoid significant fluctuations in tobacco planting. Specific suggestions include: raising the price of high-quality tobacco leaves to encourage the cultivation of more superior varieties; adjusting the tobacco leaf procurement price appropriately at the right time to ensure that the tobacco-grain-cotton price ratio is based on a relatively reasonable level; and canceling the tobacco planting subsidy, changing from hidden subsidies to explicit subsidies, so that farmers have a clear understanding of tobacco leaf prices.

### 河南烟叶市场整顿见效  行家建议采取措施避免烟草种植大起大落

    河南烟叶市场整顿见效
    行家建议采取措施避免烟草种植大起大落
    本报讯　据今天出版的《市场报》报道：河南省对烟叶市场进行治理整顿，收购工作逐步走上正轨。但与此同时，出现了底脚叶、顶叶不烤和提前拔烟现象，可能对明年的烟草种植带来不利影响。
    河南是我国烟草主产地，产量占全国的1／4。连续两年的“烟叶大战”，诱使烟草种植面积发展过快，也造成烟叶市场混乱，出现抬级抬价，掺杂使假等现象，给国家造成严重损失。今年，有关部门进行治理整顿，严格实行烟草专卖制度，烟叶由有关部门按国家标准统一收购，市场秩序明显好转。
    应该看到，前两年的“烟叶大战”使部分农民多得了一些不正当的收入。今年按国家标准收购，烟农不该拿的钱拿不到了，长期积累下来的价格不合理现象便暴露出来：一是烟粮比价不合理，一些农民感到种烟不如种粮；二是烤烟生产成本上升，一些农民觉得与其赔钱去烤烟，不如拔掉省事。
    行家认为，应当采取适当措施，避免烟草种植大起大落。具体建议是：提高优质烟叶价格，鼓励多种优良品种；在适当时机适当调整烟叶收购价，使烟粮棉比价确定在比较合理的基础上；取消烟叶种植扶持费，改暗补为明补，让农民对烟叶价格心中有数。
