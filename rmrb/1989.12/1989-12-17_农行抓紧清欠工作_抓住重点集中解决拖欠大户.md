On the other hand, the Agricultural Bank of China's (ABC) receivables are increasing, and there is severe mutual arrears between enterprises within and outside the system. In response to this situation, the ABC headquarters recently issued a notice requiring all levels of branches to strengthen leadership, focus on key areas, and further carry out the work of clearing enterprise arrears.

Since this year, the debt recovery work of various local ABC branches has made some progress and accumulated some experience. By the end of October, 109 branches had cleared a total of 5.307 billion yuan in arrears. Based on this, the ABC headquarters' notice requires all levels of branches to start from the perspective of rectification and reform, and on the basis of the previous survey, to investigate and record the number, amount, counterparty opening bank, and account information of arrears exceeding 100,000 yuan as of the end of November, categorized by industry, system, and enterprise, and report them level by level. Focus on key areas to concentrate on solving major debtors. The current focus is on helping to clear arrears for the following enterprises: agricultural and sideline product purchasing and marketing enterprises, especially those for grains, cotton, oil, and tobacco; production material purchasing and marketing enterprises; state-owned industrial enterprises and township enterprises that comply with national industrial policies, including those engaged in export earnings, supporting and servicing large-scale industries.
