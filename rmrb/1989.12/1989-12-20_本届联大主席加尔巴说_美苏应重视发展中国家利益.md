This year's UNGA President Javara said at a press conference today that the US and the Soviet Union should not neglect the interests of developing countries while closely cooperating with each other.

When discussing the Malta summit between the US and Soviet leaders, Javara said that the two superpowers should not overlook the economic and political issues of African and Latin American countries due to changes in the situation in Eastern Europe.

He said that international issues should not only be resolved through bilateral channels but also through multilateral cooperation. He emphasized the role of the United Nations in global affairs.

Javara said that he welcomes the bilateral cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union on urgent issues such as arms reduction.

He stressed that if small countries and developing countries believe that certain matters involve multilateral issues, the United Nations should compel the superpowers to resolve them through multilateral channels.

Javara also said that if the two superpowers believe that their bilateral cooperation can resolve certain issues, he hopes that whatever they do will be in line with the interests of the international community, so that all countries do not have to worry.

    本届联大主席加尔巴说
    美苏应重视发展中国家利益
    新华社联合国12月18日电  （记者雷力利）本届联大主席加尔巴在今天的新闻发布会上说，美苏两国在密切合作的同时不应忽视发展中国家的利益。
    在谈到美苏首脑马耳他会晤时，加尔巴说，两个超级大国不应因东欧局势的变化而不重视非洲和拉美国家的经济和政治问题。
    他说，解决国际问题不仅应通过双边渠道，而且应同时进行多边合作。他强调联合国在世界事务中的作用。
    加尔巴说，他欢迎美苏在解决诸如裁军这样的紧迫问题上进行双边合作。
    他强调说，一旦小国和发展中国家认为某些事务涉及多边问题，联合国就要迫使超级大国通过多边渠道来解决。
    加尔巴还说，如果两个超级大国认为其双边合作能解决某些问题，那么希望他们无论作什么都同国际社会的利益一致，而使各国不必担忧。
