The UN General Assembly today passed a resolution, once again urgently calling on the United States to abide by the International Court of Justice's ruling and immediately stop supporting military and paramilitary activities against Nicaragua.

The resolution emphasizes that "all countries have the obligation, under customary international law, not to interfere in the internal affairs of other states." The resolution was voted on, with China and 90 other countries voting in favor, and the United States and Israel voting against.

On June 27, 1986, the International Court of Justice ruled that the United States' support for anti-Nicaraguan military and paramilitary activities violated international law and must be stopped immediately. However, the United States has yet to comply with this ruling.

Nicaraguan representative Caldera spoke at the assembly, pointing out that the United States continues to support "mercenaries" aimed at opposing the Nicaraguan government, which is also a disregard for the peace agreement signed by the five presidents of Central America. The agreement calls for the disbandment of these anti-government forces. The U.S. Congress's decision to allocate $9 million to assist the Nicaraguan opposition is also an interference in Nicaragua's internal affairs. The United States' re-imposition of a trade embargo on Nicaragua violates a treaty signed by the two countries in 1956.

### 联大以91票对2票通过决议  要求美停止干涉尼加拉瓜内政

    联大以91票对2票通过决议
    要求美停止干涉尼加拉瓜内政
    本报联合国12月7日电　记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天通过了一项决议，再次紧急要求美国遵守国际法院的判决，立即停止支持针对尼加拉瓜的军事活动和准军事活动。
    决议强调“各国按照国际习惯法有不干涉别国内政的义务”。决议案表决时，中国等91国赞成，美国和以色列反对。
    国际法院在1986年6月27日曾判决美国支持反尼加拉瓜的军事活动和准军事活动是破坏了国际法，应立即停止。但美国一直未执行此判决。
    尼加拉瓜代表卡尔德拉在大会上发言，指出美国继续支持旨在反对尼政府的“雇佣军”，也是对中美洲五国总统和平协议的蔑视，该协议要求解散这批反政府武装。美国国会决定拨款900万美元资助尼反对派，也是对尼内政的干涉。美国重新对尼实行贸易禁运，违反了两国1956年签订的一项条约。
