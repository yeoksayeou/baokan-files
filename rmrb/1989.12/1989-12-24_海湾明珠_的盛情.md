On December 23, Chairman Yang Shangkun successfully concluded his friendly visit to Egypt and boarded a special plane to the United Arab Emirates, known as the "Pearl of the Gulf," marking his second stop on his tour of four Asian and African countries.

Chairman Yang's special plane flew over the Red Sea, across the Arabian Peninsula, and arrived at the southern end of the Gulf. From the window of the plane, Abu Dhabi appeared like a green pearl embedded at the southeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula.

At 4:30 PM, Chairman Yang's special plane landed in Abu Dhabi. UAE President Zayed personally welcomed him at the airport. In the airport lounge, the leaders of the two countries had a cordial conversation. Chairman Yang said, "I hope our meeting will be conducive to the development of relations between our two countries in all aspects." President Zayed said, "We should have closer relations with each other." The friendly words reflected the deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

After the welcoming ceremony at the airport, President Zayed personally accompanied Chairman Yang to the Mahiri Palace, where he would be staying.

Along the high-speed road from the airport to the city, flags of China and the UAE were hanging on both sides, and colorful lights were suspended in the central gardens. Abu Dhabi is a beautiful city, with palm trees lining both sides of the high-speed roads, colorful flowers scattered among them, and skyscrapers standing tall in the city center. The entire city looks like a large garden.

In his written speech at the airport, Chairman Yang praised the UAE people for their remarkable achievements in developing their national economy, building their country, and improving the living standards of their people.

The UAE is a newly established country formed in 1971, consisting of seven emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah, known as the "Seven Jewels of the Oil Sea." With a population of over 1.6 million, the country has seen its economy soar in the past 20 years thanks to massive oil revenues. The UAE has an average per capita income of $20,000, making it one of the richest countries in the world. The economic achievements of the UAE left a deep impression on the Chinese guests.

China and the UAE have only been diplomatic partners for over five years, but the history of friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries can be traced back to ancient times. As early as the Tang and Song dynasties, China's exquisite porcelain was exported to the UAE and other Gulf countries. In recent years, economic and trade exchanges between the two countries have been steadily developing. In 1980, China opened a route from Sharjah to Western Europe, and later established trade offices in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. After the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1985, they signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement, further accelerating the development of economic and trade relations. In 1988, the trade volume between China and the UAE reached $187 million, an increase of 51% from the previous year.

The UAE government and people attach great importance to Chairman Yang's visit this time. On December 17, when Chairman Yang was en route to Egypt from Beijing, he made a brief stop in Sharjah, UAE. Although it was just a transit, Sultan, the ruler of Sharjah, broke with tradition and personally led several government officials and royal family members to the airport to warmly welcome Chairman Yang, and personally accompanied him to the Continental Hotel where he would be staying. In the evening, Sultan held a banquet at the palace to warmly welcome Chairman Yang. Sultan said that he understood China's government actions to quell the unrest and opposed foreign interference in China's internal affairs. He said that issues involving sovereignty and independence cannot be compromised or bargained over. Sultan also expressed his intention to hold a Chinese arts festival and invite a Chinese performing arts troupe to Sharjah.

A UAE friend told the reporter that the day before Chairman Yang's arrival, Sharjah experienced four consecutive days of rain, the heaviest in seven years. The locals were so happy that they danced in the rain. After the rain, the sky of Sharjah became even clearer. The people of Sharjah said that this was the sweet rain brought by the Chinese guests. Indeed, timely rain brings good fortune, and the friendship between China and the UAE runs deep.

Tonight, the Mahiri Palace is brightly lit, and President Zayed is holding a banquet here to warmly welcome Chairman Yang. Although Chairman Yang's official friendly visit to the UAE is only for a short day, it will be remembered as an unforgettable chapter in the annals of friendly relations between the two countries.

    “海湾明珠”的盛情
    本报记者　成元生
    12月23日，杨尚昆主席圆满结束了对埃及的友好访问，乘专机赴被誉为“海湾明珠”的阿联酋，这是他亚非四国之行的第二站。
    杨主席乘坐的专机掠过红海，飞越阿拉伯半岛，飞临海湾南端。从飞机上凭窗俯瞰，阿布扎比像一颗绿色的珍珠镶嵌在阿拉伯半岛的东南端。
    下午4时半，杨主席乘坐的专机降落在阿布扎比。阿联酋总统扎耶德亲自到机场迎接。在机场休息室里，中阿两国元首进行了亲切的交谈。杨主席说，我希望我们的会晤有利于我们两国之间各方面关系的发展。扎耶德总统说，我们彼此之间应该有更紧密的关系。亲切的话语体现了两国人民之间的深厚友谊。
    扎耶德总统在机场举行隆重欢迎仪式后，亲自陪同杨主席前往下榻的马希里夫宫。
    从机场到市区高速公路两旁挂着中国、阿联酋两国国旗，街心花园里彩灯高悬。阿布扎比是个美丽的城市，高速公路两旁椰枣树成林，五颜六色的鲜花点缀其间，市中心高楼大厦鳞次栉比，整个城市就像一个大花园。
    杨主席在机场发表的书面讲话中，赞扬阿联酋人民在发展民族经济，建设自己国家，提高人民生活水平的崇高事业中取得令人瞩目的成就。
    阿联酋是1971年建立的新兴国家，由阿布扎比、迪拜、沙迦、哈伊马角、阿治曼、乌姆盖万和富查伊拉7个酋长国组成，被称为“油海七珍”，人口160多万。近20年来，这个海湾小国靠巨额石油收入使经济腾飞。阿联酋人均国民收入达2万美元，是世界上最富的国家之一。阿联酋的经济成就给中国客人留下了难忘的印象。
    中国和阿联酋建交只有5年多，但两国人民友好交往的历史却可以追溯到久远的过去。早在我国唐宋年间，我国溢彩流金的高档瓷器就远销到阿联酋等海湾诸国。近年来，两国经济贸易往来不断发展。1980年我国开辟了经沙迦到西欧的航线，此后我国又在迪拜和阿布扎比建立了贸易办事处。1985年两国建交后，签订了经济贸易技术协定，经贸关系得到更快的发展。1988年中阿两国贸易额达到1.87亿美元，比上一年增加51％。
    对于杨主席此次来访，阿联酋政府和人民非常重视。12月17日，杨主席离北京赴埃及途中在阿联酋的沙迦作短暂停留。虽然只是过境，沙迦酋长国酋长苏尔坦却打破惯例亲自率领酋长国十几名政府要员和王室成员到机场热烈欢迎杨主席，并亲自陪同杨主席到下榻的大陆饭店。晚上，苏尔坦酋长又在王宫举行宴会热烈欢迎杨主席。苏尔坦酋长说，他理解我国政府平暴之举，反对外国干涉中国内政。他说，涉及到主权和独立问题不能屈服，不能讨价还价。苏尔坦酋长还表示要举办一个中国艺术节，请中国艺术团来沙迦演出。
    一位阿联酋朋友告诉记者，杨主席来的前一天，沙迦一连下了4天雨，这是7年来最大的一次降雨，老百姓高兴地到雨中跳舞。一场喜雨过后，沙迦的天空更加澄碧。沙迦人民说，这是中国贵宾带来的甘霖。真是好雨知时节，中阿情谊深。
    今晚，马希里夫宫灯火辉煌，扎耶德总统在这里举行宴会热烈欢迎杨主席。杨主席对阿联酋的正式友好访问虽然只有短暂的一天时间，但它却将作为令人难忘的一页留在两国友好关系的编年史中。
