Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 4th.

A Chinese middle-aged painter has, for the first time, been honored with a personal research society abroad. The Zhu Ge Zhirun Ink Painting Research Society was recently established in Japan.

This society was formed at the request of Japanese art enthusiasts and is a joint effort by the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Fujisawa. Authorities in China's art community believe this to be a sign that traditional Chinese painting is gradually gaining global recognition.

Zhu Ge Zhirun, currently the director of the Art Research Room at the Beijing United University School of Economics and Management, graduated from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1966 and is a member of the Chinese Artists Association. His ink paintings blend the green-and-blue landscape paintings of the Tang Dynasty with splashed ink paintings, while also incorporating elements of Western impressionism, resulting in a unique style.

Zhu Ge Zhirun has held multiple successful solo exhibitions at venues such as the National Art Museum of China. His works have also been displayed in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, West Germany, Japan, and Hong Kong, receiving widespread acclaim. In recent years, he has visited Japan three times, holding eight solo exhibitions in cities like Tokyo, which have caused a sensation in the Japanese art world. Many Japanese professors and artists have collected his works, and some of his exhibitions have sold out entirely.

    日本成立中国一画家研究会
    新华社北京12月4日电  （记者赵明亮）我国中年画家首次在国外享有个人研究会的荣誉，著名画家诸葛志润水墨画研究会日前在日本成立。
    这一研究会是应日本美术爱好者要求，由横滨、川崎和藤泽市联合成立的。我国美术界权威人士认为，这是我国民族传统绘画艺术逐步走向世界的一个标志。
    现任北京联大经济管理学院艺术研究室主任诸葛志润教授，1966年毕业于中央工艺美术学院，是中国美协会员。他的水墨画把唐代的青绿山水画和泼墨画熔为一炉，同时吸收西方印象派的色彩，取百家之长，自成一格。
    诸葛志润曾在中国美术馆等地多次举办个人画展，均获成功。他的作品还曾在英国、美国、法国、意大利、联邦德国、日本、香港等国家和地区展出，受到普遍赞赏。近年来他三次赴日，在东京等地八次举办个人画展，轰动日本画界，许多日本教授、画家收藏他的作品，有的画展作品被销售一空。
