To encourage the development of science and technology, the state issued the "Technical Contract Law" in 1987. Various regions also stipulated preferential policies for those engaged in technical transactions, including loans, tax benefits, and reward bonuses.

However, recent investigations have revealed that many units, in order to obtain these preferential policies, have resorted to unscrupulous methods to pass off non-technical transactions as technical ones. Their method of deception is to sign fake technical contracts.

A science and technology department in Panjin City, over the past year, has fraudulently classified construction, surveying, and design transactions as technical transactions, signing fake technical contracts to easily obtain 70,000 yuan in cash. This year, the city audited 120 technical contracts and found that half were counterfeit. Tieling City uncovered 79 fake technical contracts this year, amounting to 1.558 million yuan, causing the state a tax evasion loss of around 500,000 yuan.

The provincial bureau of industry and commerce recently disclosed that from last year to the first quarter of this year, the province has uncovered more than 1,300 fake technical contracts, totaling 13.44 million yuan, resulting in approximately 3 to 4 million yuan in tax evasion losses for the state.

The evaded taxes and fraudulently obtained cash mostly end up in individuals' hands, becoming consumption funds. A design office of a certain bureau used a fake technical contract to obtain a design fee of 17,000 yuan. After the intermediary agency deducted the service fee, the remaining 15,800 yuan was entirely withdrawn as cash and distributed as allowances. A commercial management official introduced that the practice of using fake technical contracts to enjoy preferential treatment is still rampant across the province and has become a widespread and most harmful problem in some regions' technology markets. He lamented, "Nowadays, technical contracts have become a shield for obtaining cash and evading taxes!"

    “技术合同”中的违法现象
    国家为鼓励科技事业发展，曾于1987年颁布了《技术合同法》，各地同时也规定了对从事技术交易的各方，在贷款、税收、奖励酬金方面享受的优惠政策。
    可是，在最近的调查中发现，不少单位为获取这一优惠政策，竟不择手段地将一些非技术交易冒充技术交易，其冒充手段，便是签订假技术合同。
    盘锦市一家科技部门，去年以来，把本属经济内容的建设，勘察设计等交易，冒充技术交易，签订了假技术合同，轻易套购现金七万多元。该市今年抽查了120份技术合同，发现一半是冒牌货。铁岭市今年查出79份冒牌技术合同，金额155.8万元，给国家造成偷漏税损失50万元左右。
    省工商局最近透露，从去年到今年一季度，全省已查出冒牌技术合同1300多份，金额1344万元，约给国家造成偷漏税损失三四百万元。
    被偷漏的税金和骗取的现金，大都落到个人手中变为消费基金。某局设计室，利用假技术合同获得设计费1.7万元，除中介机构扣除服务费外，余下的1.58万元全部提取现金，以津贴方式分光。一位工商管理人员介绍，全省目前依靠签订冒牌技术合同享受优惠待遇的作法还在泛滥，且成为一些地区技术市场中普遍存在、危害最大的问题。他感叹：“如今的技术合同，已成为套购现金、偷漏税的保护伞！”（《辽宁日报》12月6日田南文）
