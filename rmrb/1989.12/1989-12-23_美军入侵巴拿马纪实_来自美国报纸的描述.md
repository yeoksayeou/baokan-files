At midnight on December 20, most residents of Panama were already asleep. Although there had been several shooting incidents between the Panamanian Defense Forces and U.S. troops in the Canal Zone in recent days, with both sides glaring at each other and ready for a fight, everything seemed calm for the moment.

However, a military invasion that would shock the world was about to begin.

After midnight, the residents of the capital, Panama City, were awakened by the sound of bombs. Shortly after, around 1 a.m., intense artillery fire and heavy machine gun fire tore through the night sky. The headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, led by General Manuel Noriega, was hit and caught fire. The national radio station broadcasted, "The Americans are here! The U.S. has invaded Panama!" The national television station repeatedly aired the image of the Panamanian flag.

This was the largest military operation launched by the United States since the Vietnam War, codenamed "Operation Just Cause." The main objective was to overthrow the Noriega regime and capture Noriega himself.

Under the command of the U.S. Southern Command, 13,000 local troops split into five groups and launched a surprise attack on Panama City and its surrounding targets. U.S. special forces attacked two companies of the Panamanian Defense Forces in the town of Rio Hato to the southwest of the city; paratroopers aboard armed helicopters occupied Torrijos International Airport on the eastern outskirts of the city; and the U.S. also seized the Madden Dam and power plant, blocking major transportation routes.

The U.S. forces encountered fierce resistance in Panama City. The battle raged until dawn, and the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces was almost completely flattened by U.S. light tanks and artillery. The high-rise buildings near the headquarters were engulfed in flames, and thick smoke filled the sky. But Noriega had already disappeared.

By sunset, the U.S. forces had received reinforcements from the 82nd Airborne Division and the mechanized battalion of the 5th Infantry Division from the mainland, totaling 24,000 troops, far outnumbering the more than 10,000 Panamanian Defense Forces. Additionally, approximately 10,000 troops were en route to Panama from military bases in the eastern, western, and southern United States.

In the Pentagon's war room in Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell stayed up all night. The military announced that night, "Key military objectives have been achieved, and organized resistance has been crushed." However, they also admitted that the overall situation was "neither completely under control nor out of control." Reports from Panama indicated that fighting was still ongoing between the two sides in Panama City and the second-largest city, Colón. Troops loyal to Noriega were holding 40-plus American hostages at the "Mariott" hotel on the outskirts of the capital. At least 100 Panamanian soldiers and civilians were killed, and more than 1,000 were injured in one day.

Noriega's whereabouts remained a mystery. Around 8 p.m., just before the Panamanian state radio station was destroyed by a rocket, a brief, less-than-one-minute speech by Noriega himself was broadcast. He spoke calmly, saying, "This is Manuel Antonio Noriega... I salute the Defense Forces and all Panamanians! We will not retreat a single step; we must resist and advance until victory..."

The U.S. military had offered a $1 million reward for Noriega's capture. General Powell ordered U.S. troops to search house by house for Noriega's whereabouts. Some sources believed that although the U.S. large-scale offensive had ended, the fighting had not ceased, and the situation was still developing. Gunshots and explosions were heard intermittently in Panama. At midnight, the newly appointed President, Vice President, and Foreign Minister of Panama, Endara, Ford, and Arias, were sworn in at the U.S. military base and immediately received recognition from the United States.

Today, Washington was covered in snow, and the weather was extremely cold. From morning to evening, military and political leaders from the White House, Congress, the Department of Defense, and the State Department almost all came out to defend the invasion. They claimed that the U.S. military action was to protect American interests and the safety of American citizens in Panama, "in accordance with international law." However, the military admitted that the "Operation Just Cause" plan had been brewing for at least a few months and had undergone combat exercises.

The news of the U.S. invasion of Panama has sparked strong reactions both domestically and internationally, drawing condemnation from the international community. Except for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who supported Bush's "brave decision," most countries in Latin America and Europe voiced opposition. The main leaders of both parties in the U.S. Congress expressed support for the White House's actions, but a California congressman criticized the move as "a bloody act of gunboat diplomacy." Today, relatives of those who lost their lives in Panama appeared tearfully on television. A woman whose husband was in the war said, "This Christmas is really hard!"

    美军入侵巴拿马纪实
    ——来自美国报纸的描述
    本报记者　仓立德
    12月20日凌晨，巴拿马的居民大部分已沉入梦乡。虽然近日巴拿马国防军和运河区美国驻军之间发生几起枪击事件，双方虎视眈眈，剑拔弩张，但眼下似乎一切平静如常。
    然而，一场震惊世界的军事入侵行动却迅即来临。
    午夜过后，首都巴拿马城的人被炸弹的声响惊醒。接着，1时许，猛烈的炮火和密集的机枪扫射划破夜空。巴政府最高首脑诺列加将军的国防军司令部中弹起火。国家电台传出“美国佬来啦！美军入侵巴拿马！”的呼叫。国家电视台反复播出巴国旗图案。
    这是美国自越南战争后发动的规模最大的军事行动，代号“正义事业行动”，主要目标是推翻诺列加政权，将诺列加本人抓获。
    隶属于美军“南方司令部”的1.3万名当地驻军兵分5路，同时向巴拿马城及其周围目标发起突然袭击。美军特种部队攻击了城西南方里奥哈托镇的巴国防军两个连；乘武装直升机的空降兵占领了城东郊外的托里霍斯国际机场；美军并占领了马登水坝和发电厂，封锁了交通要道。
    美军在巴拿马城遇到顽强抵抗。激战持续到拂晓，巴国防军总部基本被美军轻型坦克和火炮夷平。总部附近高层建筑火焰熊熊，浓烟蔽日。但诺列加却早已不知去向。
    至日落前，美军得到本土第82空降师、第5步兵师机械化营等数千名部队增援，总兵力达2.4万人，大大超过1万多人的巴国防军。此外，另有约1万名官兵正从美国东、西、南部军事基地向巴拿马赶来。
    华盛顿五角大楼作战室里，国防部长切尼、参谋长联席会议主席鲍威尔将军通宵坐镇。军方当晚宣布，“关键军事目标已经实现，有组织的抵抗已被粉碎”。但同时承认，整个局势“既未完全控制，也未失去控制”。从巴拿马传来的消息说，在巴拿马城和第二大城市科隆双方仍在交火。忠于诺列加的军队在首都城外“玛丽奥特”饭店扣押了40余名美国人质。一天之内巴方军人和平民至少100人丧生，1000余人受伤。
    诺列加的去向是个谜。晚8时左右，就在巴国家广播电台被火箭击毁前，广播中传出诺本人不到1分钟的简短讲话。他以平静的语气说，“这里是曼纽埃尔·安东尼奥·诺列加……我向国防军、全体巴拿马人致敬！我们绝不后退一步，必须抵抗，前进直到胜利……”
    美军方已悬赏100万美元活捉诺本人。鲍威尔将军下令美军挨家挨户搜寻诺列加的下落。此间人士认为，虽然美军的大规模进攻已告结束，但战斗并未平息，事态仍在发展中。巴拿马今天不时地传出枪声和爆炸声。午夜时分在美军基地宣布就任巴总统、副总统的恩达拉、福特和阿里亚斯，立即得到美国的承认。
    华盛顿今日积雪满地，天气奇寒。从早至晚，白宫、国会、国防部、国务院等军政首脑几乎全体出动，为这次入侵行动辩护。称美国的军事行动是为了保护美在巴的利益和侨民安全，“符合国际法”。但军方承认，“正义事业行动”作战方案至少已酝酿了几个月，并经实战演习。
    美军悍然入侵巴拿马的消息已在国内外引起强烈反响，受到国际舆论的谴责。除英国首相玛·撒切尔支持布什的“勇敢决定”外，拉美、欧洲等多数国家均同声反对。美国国会两党主要领导人都表态支持白宫的行动，但一位加州议员指责此举是“炮舰政策的嗜杀行为”。在巴拿马失去亲人的家属今天泪流满面地出现在电视屏幕上。一位丈夫参战的妇女说，“今年的圣诞节真难过！”（本报华盛顿12月21日电）
