The world's urban population is growing rapidly and is expected to reach 61% of the total population by 2025, according to a recent survey report published by the United Nations Department of International Economic and Social Affairs.

The report states that from 1950 to 1985, the proportion of the world's urban population increased from 29% to 41%. By the year 2000, this figure is projected to reach 47%, and by 2025, it is expected to reach 61%.

The report indicates that the rapid increase in urban population is closely related to economic development. Currently, the urban population in economically developed regions accounts for 72%, while in economically less developed regions, it is only 32%. The report suggests that in the coming decades, the economies of less developed regions will experience faster growth, leading to a more rapid increase in their urban populations. By 2025, the urban population rate in less developed regions is expected to reach 57%, while in developed regions, it will increase to 79%.

The report also notes that in 1985, there were 100 cities with populations exceeding 2 million, totaling 487 million residents.

The report further indicates that by the year 2000, the number of cities with populations exceeding 10 million is expected to increase from 11 in 1985 to 24.

    2025年城市人口占总人口61％
    新华社联合国电　据联合国国际经济和社会事务部最近公布的一份调查报告表明，世界城市人口呈迅速增长之势，到2025年，城市人口总数将比75年前增长一倍以上。
    报告说，从1950年到1985年，城市人口占世界总人口的比率由29％上升到41％，到2000年将达到47％，到2025年达到61％。
    报告表明，城市人口的迅速增加与经济的发展有关。目前经济发达地区的城市人口占72％，而经济较落后地区的城市人口仅占32％，报告说，在今后几十年内，落后地区的经济将会得到较快的发展，因此这些地区的城市人口也会较快地增长。到2025年，落后地区的城市人口率将达到57％，而发达地区只增长到79％。
    报告说，1985年，居民在200万以上的大城市有100个，居民总数达4.87亿。
    报告表明，到2000年，人口在1000万以上的大城市将由1985年的11个增加到24个。
