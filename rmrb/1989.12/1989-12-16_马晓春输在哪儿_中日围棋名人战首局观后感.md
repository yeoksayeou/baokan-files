The first match of the China-Japan Go Name War ended with Kobayashi Koichi winning by 1 and 1/4 points.

A difference of 1 and 1/4 points may not seem significant, but it still means a loss. So, where did Ma Xiaochun lose?

Ma Xiaochun said, "Perhaps it was the joseki in the upper left corner that cost me..." Perhaps, but this is not a definitive conclusion. Kobayashi Koichi repeatedly emphasized, "If I had lost, then the 46th move would have been the losing move; I should have split the second line." However, it was the black player (Ma Xiaochun) who lost. Where did he lose? He did not say.

In the analysis room, Nie Weiping, 9-dan, said, "Ma Xiaochun did not fully understand the joseki in the upper left corner." This opinion is somewhat similar to Ma Xiaochun's view. But did a slight disadvantage in one joseki lead to the defeat? Nie Weiping did not draw such a conclusion. Others, such as Liu Xiaoguang, 9-dan, and Jiang Zhujiu, 9-dan, also expressed some opinions, but the conclusions were not very clear.

Shortly after the start of the match, Yu Bin, 8-dan, based on his understanding of Ma Xiaochun, said, "Ma Xiaochun does not usually play like this." Although it was just a casual remark, the author believes it touched on some key points. "Not usually playing like this" indicates that it was not a familiar way of playing. Surprising the opponent may sometimes work, but for an experienced and highly adaptable player like Kobayashi Koichi, this is clearly not a good strategy. Ma Xiaochun is known for his elegant and agile playing style, so he should quickly seize strategic points in the opening stage and maximize the advantage of playing black. When facing an attack, he should then use his ability to take and give, and move flexibly. However, in the first match, Ma Xiaochun used the "small target" opening and a rarely used two-space high pincer joseki. This made it difficult for him to play comfortably, ultimately resulting in a 1 and 1/4 point difference.

On the 16th, the second match will be played. The author hopes that Ma Xiaochun will learn from the lessons of the first match's defeat and fully demonstrate his strengths in the second match, giving a brilliant performance.

    马晓春输在哪儿
    ——中日围棋名人战首局观后感
    中日围棋名人战第一局比赛以小林光一胜1又1／4子而告终。
    1又1／4子，差距虽然不大，毕竟是输了。那么，输在哪儿呢？
    马晓春名人说：“也许是左上角的定式吃了点亏……”也许，并不是肯定的结论。小林光一名人则反复强调：“如果我输了，那么第46步棋就是败着，应当拆二。”但是，棋是黑方（马晓春）输了，输在哪儿？他没有说。
    研究室中，聂卫平九段说：“左上角的定式马晓春没有研究透。”这意见虽与马晓春的意见比较接近。但一个定式吃一点小亏就导致了败局？聂卫平并没有下这样的断语。其他，如刘小光九段、江铸久九段等均发表了一些意见，而结论也都不是十分明确。
    开赛不久，俞斌八段凭他对马晓春的了解，说了这么一句话：“马晓春平时不是这么下的。”只是随意的一句话，笔者却认为多少点中了一些问题的要害。“平时不这么下”，说明它不是自己熟悉的下法。出敌不意虽也时而有之，但对于经验丰富且应变能力极强的小林光一，这显然不是上策。马晓春向以棋风飘逸、轻灵而著称，这就应当在布局阶段尽快抢占战略要点，最大限度地发挥出黑方的先行之利。而一旦遭到对方攻击时，再使出自己能取能舍、灵活腾挪的本领。而第一局比赛，马晓春采用的却是“向小目”布局，以及自己很少下过的二间高夹定式。如此，则很难得心应手，终于造成了1又1／4子的差距。
    16日再战。笔者期待着马晓春总结第一局失利的教训，在第二局比赛中能充分发挥出自己的特长，作一番出色的表演。　罗建文
