The implementation of the household contract responsibility system in Laixi County, Shandong Province, has significantly activated rural productivity, but some erroneous views have also spread: “Land is divided to households, no need for party members and branches,” “As long as you can make money, you are a good party member.” The organizational consciousness and sense of purpose of some party members have weakened, and the relationship between the party and the masses has become tense.

Reality has taught the county and township-level party committees: rural areas need to become prosperous, and party branches are indispensable. Therefore, the entire county has generally improved the party branches at the village level, adjusted the party small groups, and established a target incentive system for party branches and party members at the village level based on the principle of strict party governance. Each party branch and the majority of party members are not willing to fall behind and are working to restore the party's prestige. Last year, 209 village branches in the entire county became advanced party branches, and more than 2,200 party members were rated as outstanding party members.

The village level implements the system of party members taking responsibility for households, forming an organizational structure where the branch leads the small group, the small group leads the party members, and the party members lead the villagers. The rural landscape has rapidly improved, and various tasks have regained vitality.

For a period, some villages in Laixi County had weak and dispersed party branches, village committees, and other mass organizations. The party's line, principles, and policies, as well as a large number of local party and government tasks, reached the village but could not enter the households.

Now, a benign operating mechanism has been formed with the party branch as the core, the village committee as the foundation, and the party members' contact households and villagers' small groups as the link. This ensures that the party's principles and policies and the construction of the two civilizations smoothly reach the villages and households, leading to profound changes in people's thinking.

First, the pioneering and exemplary leading role of party members has been fully brought into play. When Li Jia Tuan Village in Shuijie Town first developed grapes, 15 party members took the lead in contracting for three years. In the first year, there was no income; in the second year, the income was not much. After two years, the grape garden had a bumper harvest, with a net income of over 800 yuan per mu. At this time, the party members voluntarily withdrew from the contracted garden and handed it over to 12 relatively poor households. The masses said, "Only the Communist Party members have high consciousness." This village's 43 party members all set an example and were praised by the masses as the "soul of the village."

Second, the enthusiasm of the villagers to build a civilized new village has reached an unprecedented height. Han Jia Hui Village in Pu Mu Township is a large village with over 170 households. In the past few years, fighting, theft, gambling, and petitioning were common. Since strengthening the village-level construction and repairing the "disrupted links," Han Jia Hui Village has been stable and united, economically developed, and the village's appearance has been renewed. It has been named a model civilized village by the Qingdao Municipal Government.

In the past few years, while implementing the household contract responsibility system, some places saw the village-level organizations lose their cohesion, and many villages' collective assets were depleted, resulting in many "empty shell" villages. Laixi County once had over 200 backward villages, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the total number of villages in the county.

Without a strong collective economy, how can we talk about doing good things for the people?

Facing the lessons, while consolidating and improving the household contract responsibility system, Laixi County's village-level organizations have actively strengthened the collective economy.

The county has over 2,000 village-run collective enterprises, with a total output value of nearly 400 million yuan last year and a profit of over 39 million yuan. Out of 203 backward villages in the county, 143 have shed their backward labels, and out of 18,000 impoverished households, 13,000 have become prosperous. In recent years, Nan Zhuang Town's Bei Song Village has taken the road of common prosperity, investing 7.8 million yuan to establish six graphite processing enterprises, with an annual output value of 30 million yuan. Last year, the village's total industrial and agricultural income reached 26 million yuan, with a collective accumulation of 12 million yuan. It has been rated as a model civilized village at the municipal, county, and township levels for three consecutive years.

While developing production, they also focus on increasing accumulation and strengthening the collective economy. In 1988, the village-level accumulation reached over 150 million yuan, an increase of one-third compared to 1985. Some of these funds were used for reinvestment in agriculture, expanding irrigated land by 170,000 mu, and over 90% of the villages have electricity. Rural production and farmers' lives have begun to enter a new stage.

    两个文明建设进村到户
    新华社记者　张荣大　本报记者　贾建舟
    山东省莱西县实行家庭联产承包制后，农村生产力空前活跃，一些错误说法也随之流传开来：“分田到了户，再不用党员和支部”，“只要能挣钱，就是好党员。”一些党员的组织观念和宗旨意识也淡化了，党群关系趋向紧张。
    现实教育了县、乡两级党委：农村要致富，少了党支部是不行的。于是，全县村级普遍健全了党支部，调整了党小组，并本着从严治党的原则，全县村级建立了党支部和党员的目标激励制度。各党支部和广大党员不甘心落后，重振党的威信。去年全县有二百零九个村支部成为先进党支部，有二千二百多名党员被评为优秀党员。
    村级实行党员包户制度，形成了一个支部抓小组、小组抓党员、党员带村民的组织结构。农村面貌迅速改观，各项工作重现生机。
    有一段时间，莱西县一些村庄的党支部、村委会和其他群众团体组织软弱涣散，党的路线、方针、政策和地方党政的大量工作虽然到了村边，却进不了户。
    如今形成以党支部为核心、以村委会为基础、以党员联系户和村民小组为纽带的良性运行机制，使党的方针政策和两个文明建设畅通无阻地进村到户，人们的思想发生了深刻变化。
    一是党员的先锋模范带头作用充分发挥出来。水集镇李家疃村刚发展葡萄的时候，十五名党员带头承包了三年。头一年，没见钱；第二年，收入也不多。两年后，葡萄园喜获丰收，每亩盈利八百多元。这时党员却主动退出承包园，让给十二个比较困难的户。群众说：“还是共产党员觉悟高。”这个村四十三名党员个个率先垂范，被群众誉为“村魂”。
    二是村民建设文明新村的积极性空前高涨。朴木乡韩家汇村是一个一百七十多户的大村，前几年打架斗殴、偷盗赌博、上访告状成风。自从加强村级建设，修补起“断层”，这几年韩家汇村安定团结，经济发展，村容村貌焕然一新，被青岛市人民政府命名为文明村庄标兵。
    前几年在实行大包干的同时，一些地方村级组织失去凝聚力，许多村的集体家底空了，造成了许多“空壳”村。莱西县一度有二百多落后村，接近全县总村数的四分之一。
    集体经济壮大不起来，还谈什么为群众办好事？
    在教训面前，莱西县村级组织在巩固和完善家庭联产承包制的同时，积极壮大集体经济。
    全县村办集体企业已达两千多处，去年完成产值近四亿元，实现利润三千九百多万元。全县二百零三个落后村有一百四十三个摘掉了后进帽子，一万八千个经济困难户有一万三千户脱贫致富。南墅镇北村宋村近几年走共同富裕道路，先后投资七十八万元，新上石墨加工企业六个，年产值达三百万元。去年，全村工农业总收入达到二百六十万元，集体积累达一百二十万元，连续三年被评为市、县、镇三级文明村庄标兵。
    在发展生产的同时，他们也注重增加积累壮大集体经济，一九八八年村级积累达一亿五千多万元，比一九八五年增长三分之一。其中部分资金用于农业再投入，扩大水浇地十七万亩，百分之九十以上的村庄拉上了电，农村生产和农民生活开始迈上新台阶。
