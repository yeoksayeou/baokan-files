The majestic Mount Tai has captivated countless visitors from ancient times to the present. People often only see the beauty of Mount Tai but rarely think of the people who work tirelessly on the mountain. In fact, the spiritual beauty of these people is in no way inferior to the scenic beauty of Mount Tai.

The "Beauticians" of Mount Tai

On Mount Tai, you often see people like this. Some carry large buckets, climbing and walking along the winding mountain paths, while others hold brooms and dustpans, meticulously sweeping away the fruit peels and paper scraps discarded by tourists. These are the members of the Mount Tai cleaning team, known as the "beauticians of Mount Tai." Thanks to their hard work, the paths on Mount Tai are clean and fresh, the toilets are spotless, the streets are orderly, and Mount Tai appears even more magnificent.

A few years ago, the sanitation conditions on Mount Tai were criticized by tourists multiple times. To improve this situation, the Tai'an Municipal People's Government reorganized and strengthened the Mount Tai cleaning team. The fate of dozens of young bloods was thus closely tied to Mount Tai. The task before them was arduous. From the foot of the mountain at Wangmu Pool to the 1,545-meter-high Jade Emperor Peak, the east and west paths stretch for 40 kilometers, with over 40 scenic spots and 31 toilets, covering a cleaning area of 700,000 square meters. Mount Tai receives over 2 million tourists each year, and all the fruit peels, food bags, miscellaneous items, and even excrement discarded by these tourists must be cleaned up by these few dozen people. In the summer, the scorching sun mercilessly bakes them, sudden torrential rains often soak them to the bone, and fog and mist add many dangers as they carry heavy buckets of waste up and down the mountain. In the winter, the temperature on Mount Tai often drops to below -30 degrees Celsius. When cleaning the toilets, the excrement freezes solid, and they have to use pickaxes and shovels to chip it away. Their hands freeze and crack, oozing blood, and the pain is excruciating.

Once, Zhang Dianchun, the leader of the Daitop team, was carrying waste in the fog on a snowy path when he suddenly slipped and fell on the rocks. The waste bucket rolled away, splashing waste all over him, and five of his teeth fell into the snow. He grabbed a handful of dry grass to wipe off the filth, picked up his teeth, and carried the waste to the cable car.

Back home, his wife said, "Working at home, you can earn a thousand or two thousand yuan a year, but with your 70 yuan monthly salary, it's not as much as what women earn at home. We won't do this job anymore." Zhang Dianchun thought about it all night, but the next day, he still put on his mask and went up the mountain. The tears of his parents, the pleading of his wife, and the small hands of his children could not hold him back. In the 7 years since the team was established, he has spent 5 Spring Festivals on the mountain. What force makes them so devoted to their work? The party secretary, Liu Qingquan, said well: "The main reason is that our team members link their love for their hometown and Mount Tai with their love for their country."

The Guardians of Mount Tai

Mount Tai receives over 2 million domestic and international tourists each year. To ensure that this world-famous mountain has a good tourist environment, the officers of the Daitop Police Station work day and night.

To criminals, the police are a nightmare. On the cliffs and in the dense forests, there are always officers watching and monitoring them.

In the past three years, the officers of this police station have arrested 189 gamblers and seized gambling money totaling 26,135 yuan.

The police are the tourists' family. Losing items, losing family members, getting sick or injured, having trouble with accommodation or food, or even running out of travel money, all these problems are brought to the police. The officers enthusiastically help solve all the tourists' requests. People call the Daitop Police Station the "All-Care Department" of Mount Tai.

A 70-year-old woman from Chengguan Town, Yanzhou City, Shandong Province, suddenly fell ill and fainted at the top of the mountain, losing control of her bowels. The monks at Bixia Temple immediately reported this to the police station, and the officers quickly arranged for her to stay nearby, found a doctor to treat her, and brought her soup and meals, cleaned up after her, and took care of her for 8 days until her son came to take her away.

A young worker from the Shijiazhuang Television Factory in Hebei Province got separated from his companions and had no money on him. He was hungry and dizzy, so he went to the police station. The officers arranged for him to eat and even lent him money to go home.

Last year during the National Day, two German students climbed Mount Tai but couldn't find a place to stay and were freezing. The station chief, Gao Zhiyou, found them and led them to a hotel to help them find accommodation.

The next day, the two students came to the station to thank them, praising, "The Chinese police are so good!"

In the past two years, the officers have rescued 82 injured or sick tourists, helped 194 tourists find lost family members or lost items, provided travel or living expenses for 83 people, and paid medical expenses for injured tourists totaling 1,827 yuan.

People admire Mount Tai and often feel proud to have climbed it. There are also people who encounter setbacks in life, become pessimistic and disillusioned, and come to this first mountain under heaven to find a place to end their lives.

When encountering such situations, the officers spare no effort to rescue them, risking their lives to climb and save those in danger, and also patiently persuade them, arranging food and accommodation, treating injuries, and providing travel expenses, helping these would-be suicides to raise their sails of life again.

Many of those who were saved from death and those who returned from the brink of despair enthusiastically praised the officers as the "Living Buddhas" of Mount Tai.

A young woman from Changqing County, Shandong Province, had health problems and heavy mental pressure. She jumped off the cliff at the top of the mountain and broke her leg. The officers organized people to send her to the hospital for emergency treatment and found her family members, until her family took her back...

The cleaning team and the guards of Mount Tai have made selfless contributions to the tourists. The tourists sincerely say, "Their virtue can compare to Mount Tai."

For the tourists, they are so caring, but for themselves, it seems too ruthless.

The officers are mostly demobilized soldiers. In the past, when they were in the army, husbands and wives were separated, like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. Now that they have transferred to the police, they are on the 1,545-meter-high mountain all year round, becoming the Weaver Girl and the Cowherd. During the peak tourist season, even if their wives and children are sick, they can hardly go home to see them.

This is the reason why the Daitop Police Station has been awarded the collective third-class merit twice in a row and has been named an advanced unit and a civilized unit by the Mount Tai Management Committee, the Tai'an City Public Security Bureau, the Mount Tai District Committee, the Mount Tai District Government, and the Tai'an City Committee and Government. People affectionately call them the "Guardians of Mount Tai."

### 他们的情操可与泰山媲美

    他们的情操可与泰山媲美
    朱学胜
    巍巍泰山，陶醉了古今中外多少游客。
    人们往往只看到泰山的美，却难以想到那些辛辛苦苦工作在泰山上的人们。其实，这些人的精神美并不比泰山景观的美逊色。
    泰山“美容师”
    在泰山上，你经常可以看到这样一些人。他们或肩挑大桶，攀爬穿行在曲折的盘山道上，或手持帚箕，认认真真地清扫着游客们丢弃的果皮纸屑。这就是被人们誉为“泰山美容师”的泰山清洁队的队员们。在他们的辛勤劳动下，泰山盘道清新如洗，厕所干干净净，天街整齐有序，泰山显得更加壮美。
    几年前，泰山的卫生状况受到游客的多次批评。
    为了改变这种状况，泰安市人民政府整顿、加强了泰山清洁队，几十名热血青年的命运就这样和泰山紧紧地联系在一起。他们面临的任务是艰巨的。从山脚下的王母池到1545米高的玉皇顶，东西两路绵延40华里，其中有40多个风景名胜点，31个厕所，保洁面积达到70万平方米。泰山每年要接待200余万游客，这些人抛撒的果皮、食品袋、杂物甚至粪便，都要靠这几十人清扫担运。夏天，炎炎赤日无情地炙烤着他们，突然下起的瓢泼大雨常常把他们淋得浑身透湿，云遮雾罩又为他们担着沉重的便桶攀山越涧增加了许多危险。冬天，泰山气温常常下降到零下30多度。清理厕所时，粪便冻得梆梆硬，只好用钢钎撬，铁镐刨，手冻裂了，渗着丝丝鲜血，钻心地痛。
    一次，岱顶分队长张殿春，冒着大雾在满是积雪的小路上挑运粪便，突然脚下一滑，摔倒在石头上，粪桶从身上滚过去，粪便溅了一身，5颗牙齿也摔落在雪地上。他抓了把枯草，擦了擦身上的脏物，拣起牙齿，把粪便装进桶里一直挑到索道。
    回到家中，妻子说：“在家劳动，一年还挣一两千，你每月70元工资，还不如娘们在家挣得多，这活咱不干了。”张殿春想了一夜，第二天还是戴上口罩上了山。父母的眼泪，妻子的哀求，孩子们的小手，都没有拉住他，建队7年多，他有5个春节是在山上过的。是什么力量使他们对自己的事业如此执著？支部书记刘清泉说得好：“主要是我们的队员把爱家乡、爱泰山同爱祖国联系在一起。”
    泰山卫士
    泰山每年有200多万国内外游客。为了保证世界名山有一个良好的旅游环境，岱顶派出所十余名干警日日夜夜都在紧张地战斗着。
    公安干警对犯罪分子来说，是克星。在悬崖峭壁、在密林深处，都有干警对犯罪分子进行监视的身影。
    近3年来，这个派出所的干警们共抓获赌博分子189名，缴获赌资26135元。
    警察是游客的亲人。丢了东西，失散亲人，生病受伤，食宿碰到困难甚至路费不够都找警察。对游客的要求，干警们都满腔热情地帮助解决。人们称岱顶派出所是泰山上的“不管部”。
    山东郯城县城关镇一位70岁的老太太在山顶突然发病昏迷，大小便失禁，碧霞寺道士立即报告派出所，干警们马上就近安排住处，找医生治病，并端汤送饭，倒屎倒尿，连续伺侯了8天，直到他儿子赶来接走。
    河北省石家庄市电视机厂一青年工人与同伴失散，身上未带分文，人生地不熟，饿得头晕眼花，找到派出所，干警们安排他吃饭，还借给她回家路费。
    西德两个留学生去年国庆爬上泰山，因找不到住处冻得直哭，所长高志友发现后，领着两名外宾跑到旅馆帮助联系住宿。
    第二天，这两个留学生跑到所里道谢，连连称赞：“中国的警察真好！”
    两年多来，干警们共救助伤病游客82人次，帮助游客寻找失散亲人和丢失财物194人次，赞助路费或生活费83人次，为伤病游客垫支医药费1827元。
    人们仰慕泰山，往往为登上泰山而自豪。也有这样一些人，人生旅途上遇到失意的事情，悲观厌世，便孤身一人跑到这天下第一山来寻找人生的归宿。
    碰到这种情况，干警们更是全力以赴，千方百计进行挽救，不仅冒着生命危险攀藤附葛抢救垂危的生命，而且还苦口婆心地进行劝导，为他们安排食宿、治疗伤病、赞助路费，促使这些轻生者重新扬起生活的风帆。
    不少死而复生者和迷途归返者热情赞扬干警们是泰山的“活菩萨”。
    山东省长清县一女青年身体有病，思想压力很大，在山顶拱北石跳崖自杀，摔断了腿。干警们组织人员把她送到医院抢救，又多方查找到她的亲人，直至亲人把她领回……
    泰山的清洁队员们和卫士们，为游客作出了无私的奉献，游客们发自内心地说：“他们的情操可与泰山媲美”。
    对游客如此关心，而对自己呢？却又似乎太无情。
    干警们多是复员军人，过去当兵时夫妻分居两地，是“牛郎织女”，现在转业干了公安，长年累月在1545米的高山上，又成了“织女牛郎”。赶上旅游旺季，即使妻儿老小有病也难得回家看一眼。
    这就是岱顶派出所——连续两年荣获集体三等功，先后被泰山管委会、山东省泰安市公安局、泰山区委、泰山区政府和山东省泰安市委、市政府命名为先进单位、文明单位的原因所在，人们亲切地称他们为“泰山卫士”。
